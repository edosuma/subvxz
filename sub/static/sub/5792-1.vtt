01:49.520 --> 01:50.806
Hi, you must be Casey?

01:50.920 --> 01:52.100
Yes, I am. Hello.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.300
- How you doing? Simon.
- Hi, Simon.

01:53.400 --> 01:54.940
My wife, Robyn.
Sorry we kept you waiting.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.820
No, it's no problem.

01:56.920 --> 01:58.260
It was a little tough
getting up here, but...

01:58.360 --> 01:59.300
- Yeah?
- We made it.

01:59.400 --> 02:00.420
- But worth it.
- Yeah.

02:00.520 --> 02:01.940
Look at the koi pond in the entryway.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.660
I absolutely think it is fantastic.

02:04.760 --> 02:05.940
But no fish?

02:06.040 --> 02:08.725
No fish. You have
to bring your own fish.

02:08.840 --> 02:10.900
- This is a mid-century modern home.
- Right.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.620
- And so it has a very open floor plan.
- Mmm-hmm.

02:13.720 --> 02:16.700
Lots of light, which
I love myself, personally.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.883
- And this fireplace, oversized fireplace.
- Mmm.

02:20.840 --> 02:22.444
So what brings you to California then?

02:22.560 --> 02:24.140
Well, I've got a new job.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.891
- Oh, congratulations.
- Yeah. Very excited.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.100
So you guys are from Chicago?

02:29.200 --> 02:32.220
My wife is. I actually grew up
a little bit south of here.

02:32.320 --> 02:33.890
We are making a fresh start.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.525
So there's your office.

02:49.240 --> 02:50.260
Hmm?

02:50.360 --> 02:54.060
It's not exactly what we're looking for,
but kind of interesting, right?

02:54.160 --> 02:55.420
Good view?

02:55.520 --> 02:57.060
- You like it?
- What do you think?

02:57.160 --> 02:58.491
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

02:59.120 --> 03:00.121
Mmm-hmm.

03:06.080 --> 03:07.580
Stupid sop.

03:07.680 --> 03:08.886
You want to see the bedrooms?

03:09.000 --> 03:11.241
Yeah, I'm gonna have a look.

03:24.960 --> 03:25.940
A quick shop, and then...

03:26.040 --> 03:27.700
No, no, then we'll
get it done really fast.

03:27.800 --> 03:30.180
A quick shop,
and then the store's closed.

03:30.280 --> 03:31.645
Yeah, because what time does the...

03:33.960 --> 03:35.086
Okay.

03:37.480 --> 03:39.209
- How is your day today?
- It's good.

03:42.320 --> 03:45.051
All righty. Is that
all for you today then?

03:45.160 --> 03:49.300
Except for one thing my wife's going
to bring down soon, I hope.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.641
No problem. I'll just look
for a delivery date then.

03:51.760 --> 03:56.260
Yeah, please, and is the end
of today too ambitious?

03:56.360 --> 03:59.540
- It's late, isn't it?
- Yeah, our truck already passed.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.380
Tomorrow work? I have a window
from, like, 7:00 to 9:00?

04:02.480 --> 04:03.900
Sounds good to me.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.445
Hey, excuse me.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.180
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:07.280 --> 04:11.001
I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm... I think I know you.

04:13.200 --> 04:16.100
Yeah? I'm sorry,
I don't... Can't place you.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.043
Is your name Simon? Simon Callem?

04:18.160 --> 04:20.003
Yeah, Simon. Hi.

04:20.519 --> 04:22.170
How do we know each other?

04:22.280 --> 04:25.300
I thought... We went to school together.

04:25.400 --> 04:26.460
- Really? Huh.
- Yeah.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.420
- Which one? Fairmount...
- Fairmount Park.

04:28.520 --> 04:29.567
- Really.
- Yeah.

04:29.680 --> 04:31.580
Same grade? What year did you graduate?

04:31.680 --> 04:32.681
Hey, honey.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.100
Excuse me, one second.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.100
- They close in 15 minutes.
- Okay, sure. We will rush.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.540
This is my wife, Robyn.
This is... I didn't catch your name, sorry.

04:38.640 --> 04:41.260
- Gordon Mosley. Gordo.
- Hi. Gordon.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.407
- Robyn.
- Gordo?

04:42.520 --> 04:46.260
- Right.
- Wow! Buddy, I did not recognize you.

04:46.360 --> 04:47.566
Gordon Mosley.

04:48.040 --> 04:51.300
Oh, my gosh, honey. Gordo and I
went to school together like...

04:51.400 --> 04:53.580
- I don't know, what, 80 years ago?
- Really?

04:53.680 --> 04:55.523
- My God. Wow!
- Almost.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.460
- Sorry, excuse me, I just...
- You look very different.

04:57.560 --> 04:59.340
- Yes, sorry.
- ...need your address, for the...

04:59.440 --> 05:00.980
Oh, Yeah. 32 Castlewood.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.980
- That is so crazy.
- Just one word.

05:03.080 --> 05:04.525
We just moved here from Chicago.

05:04.640 --> 05:05.940
Oh. Great city.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.280
So he's moved home then?

05:07.400 --> 05:08.460
- Well.
- Well, almost home.

05:08.560 --> 05:10.580
Close to. Close to, not quite.

05:10.680 --> 05:11.780
- You're going to love it.
- Yeah.

05:11.880 --> 05:13.291
- You know.
- Well, yeah.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.802
We have to get going,
but we... We should...

05:16.920 --> 05:18.940
- Why don't you get Gordo's phone number?
- Sure.

05:19.040 --> 05:20.820
And we'll call and
we'll catch up, right?

05:20.920 --> 05:22.420
We've got a lot of ground to cover.

05:22.520 --> 05:24.409
- Right?
- Great, that's perfect.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.140
- Here, do you want to...
- All right.

05:26.240 --> 05:29.340
Gordo, I'm so sorry
we don't have time to catch up.

05:29.440 --> 05:30.521
It's here.

05:30.680 --> 05:31.761
Great.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.700
But life good though?

05:35.800 --> 05:38.087
Yeah, you know, I can't complain.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.580
- That's great to hear.
- You know? Yes.

05:39.680 --> 05:41.900
Really, really good to see you.
I'm glad you said hi.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.460
- See you.
- Okay. We'll call you.

05:43.560 --> 05:44.620
Nice to meet you, Robyn.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.245
Good to meet you too.

05:47.560 --> 05:49.660
Super awkward.
Whole first half of the conversation,

05:49.760 --> 05:51.180
I had no idea who that guy was.

05:51.280 --> 05:52.700
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:52.800 --> 05:53.881
Seemed like a nice guy.

05:54.040 --> 05:55.087
Yeah.

07:06.640 --> 07:08.260
We're not going to be late.
Stop worrying.

07:08.360 --> 07:10.010
- I'm not worrying.
- Hey. Hi.

07:10.640 --> 07:12.051
- Hello.
- Hi.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.690
Lucy and Ron.

07:15.240 --> 07:16.810
Hi. I'd be Ron.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.567
Robyn.

07:19.080 --> 07:20.445
Welcome to the neighborhood.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.220
- Thank you.
- Are you settling in okay?

07:23.320 --> 07:24.401
Yeah.

07:24.520 --> 07:28.241
If you want to come by for a cup
of tea or a glass of wine, you know,

07:28.360 --> 07:30.522
- I'm here all the time, so...
- Sounds good.

07:30.640 --> 07:31.940
- Okay. Good to meet you.
- Take care.

07:32.040 --> 07:34.100
Bye.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.202
Sweetie, hold on a second.

07:36.720 --> 07:37.881
I'll be right there.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.970
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.180
House looks nice.

08:11.280 --> 08:12.700
Oh. Yeah.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.609
- Is that it right there?
- Yeah.

08:14.720 --> 08:17.963
Go, take a look.
Wait, here, this is the note.

08:19.440 --> 08:22.250
"Welcome home," smiley face, "Gordo."

08:23.480 --> 08:26.086
How did he get our address?

08:26.200 --> 08:28.806
I have no idea.

08:30.200 --> 08:32.441
I suppose we should thank him.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.280
Okay, okay.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.180
She's beautiful.

08:48.280 --> 08:49.660
Oh, thank you.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.569
What? You are.

08:51.960 --> 08:53.380
You want to say hi to Robyn?

08:53.480 --> 08:56.020
- You want to go say hi? Here you go.
- Oh.

08:56.120 --> 08:57.451
Thank you.

09:00.280 --> 09:03.409
Hey. It's okay. Shh. Hey.

09:04.120 --> 09:05.804
Hi. Hi.

09:06.640 --> 09:07.846
You're a natural.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.530
Do you want one?

09:11.960 --> 09:14.167
Yeah.

09:14.320 --> 09:15.765
We're trying.

09:18.760 --> 09:23.322
I was pregnant, actually,
last year, in Chicago.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.682
It wasn't a very happy ending.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.691
It sent me into a bit of a rough patch.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.163
I will bore you
with the details some other time.

09:37.520 --> 09:40.683
Yeah, no, I revised the plan
to include the open staircase.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.220
If you want, my assistant is in Chicago.
She can get you a hard copy.

09:45.320 --> 09:47.448
Okay. Great.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.361
- Oh.
- Hi.

10:17.480 --> 10:19.369
- Hello.
- Gordo.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.660
Oh, yeah, yeah, yes. Gordo, hi.

10:22.760 --> 10:23.820
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.081
Hi.

10:25.400 --> 10:26.780
- Hey, Gordo, how are you?
- How are you?

10:26.880 --> 10:27.881
- Hi.
- It's nice to see you.

10:28.000 --> 10:28.940
Oh, hello.

10:29.040 --> 10:30.087
Hi. How you doing?

10:30.200 --> 10:31.201
Good. How are you?

10:31.320 --> 10:32.845
- Good. Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.340
Is Simon home?

10:35.440 --> 10:38.940
No. He's at work.
Yeah, setting up the new office.

10:39.040 --> 10:40.041
Oh.

10:40.280 --> 10:42.300
Hey. Thank you for the lovely gift.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.140
That was very sweet,

10:44.240 --> 10:46.322
but I'm sure that you
spoke to Simon about that.

10:46.560 --> 10:47.561
Uh...

10:48.960 --> 10:50.724
Well, he might have left me a message.

10:50.840 --> 10:53.980
Oh. Well, maybe we wrote
the number down wrong.

10:54.080 --> 10:57.323
Well, you see I made you a list.

10:58.200 --> 11:03.604
Local people, like plumbers,
gardeners, maids...

11:04.240 --> 11:05.980
- All that good stuff.
- That's very considerate.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.100
Thank you.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.140
And that's me.

11:08.240 --> 11:10.083
There you are. Gordo.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.046
Oh, and...

11:13.640 --> 11:15.244
- Here you go. Yeah.
- What is it? Glass cleaner?

11:15.400 --> 11:16.640
- For cleaning glass.
- Right.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.171
- I saw how much you had.
- Yeah.

11:18.920 --> 11:20.604
- There you go.
- Thank you.

11:20.720 --> 11:21.926
Welcome.

11:22.080 --> 11:23.286
Very sweet of you. Thanks, Gordo.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.926
I gotta say,
I really, I love this house.

11:26.480 --> 11:27.891
- You do? Huh.
- Wow.

11:28.640 --> 11:32.087
Yeah, I really like
this style of architecture.

11:32.280 --> 11:36.968
Well, you should come in
and take the tour then.

11:37.080 --> 11:38.540
I'm sure Simon will be back soon.

11:38.640 --> 11:39.900
- Come on in.
- Oh, all right.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.380
- Yeah. Come on in.
- Sure?

11:41.480 --> 11:43.448
- Yeah. It's fine.
- Okay.

11:44.840 --> 11:48.287
He's so excited not to be
cooped up in a condo anymore.

11:49.280 --> 11:52.807
That's the laundry
room slash Jangles' room.

11:53.760 --> 11:56.286
Down there is some storage.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.849
That is going to be Simon's office.

12:00.440 --> 12:04.047
Bedroom, or studio for me, I'm hoping.

12:04.160 --> 12:06.208
And in here is the...

12:12.840 --> 12:16.845
Oh, yeah. I was just
sorting all that stuff out.

12:18.560 --> 12:19.607
Hmm.

12:21.600 --> 12:25.366
Yeah, I know. It was a gift
and then it turned out that

12:25.480 --> 12:28.324
Simon has a phobia of monkeys
from when he was a kid.

12:28.840 --> 12:32.162
He's like, terrified.
I have to get rid of it. You want it?

12:36.960 --> 12:38.371
Do you have a baby?

12:39.680 --> 12:42.365
No. No.

12:44.840 --> 12:48.845
Just the dog, for now.
Mr. Bojangles, after the song.

12:52.080 --> 12:56.220
I'm going to move that stuff around
the back there and then plant

12:56.320 --> 13:00.086
and, I don't know,
maybe fill a pond here up with fish,

13:00.200 --> 13:02.940
since it's just sitting there, and yeah...

13:03.040 --> 13:04.883
I mean that's pretty much it.

13:05.360 --> 13:08.887
It's going to come up looking
real nice. It's already great.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.081
Thank you.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.521
I should go and check on that.

13:16.760 --> 13:18.285
In fact, there's plenty of food.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.020
I'm not that great a cook,

13:20.120 --> 13:22.601
but why don't I check in with Simon,
and maybe we can all eat together?

13:22.720 --> 13:23.926
Oh, I don't want to...

13:24.040 --> 13:25.371
Yeah.

13:29.440 --> 13:30.885
Hey, it's me.

13:31.440 --> 13:35.445
I'm cooking, believe it or not,
and we have a guest.

13:35.600 --> 13:36.931
Call me.

13:41.880 --> 13:42.961
Well. Good.

13:43.080 --> 13:46.020
You know, I often think about
this person from school

13:46.120 --> 13:47.820
- and that person from school.
- Yeah?

13:47.920 --> 13:50.446
About what are they up to,
what are they doing, and I often...

13:50.920 --> 13:53.924
But I always knew that Simon

13:54.040 --> 13:57.820
would be one of those people
who would make something of himself.

13:57.920 --> 14:01.540
You have. Clearly, you have.
And you did.

14:01.640 --> 14:04.405
I mean, I'm very happy for you.

14:05.040 --> 14:07.930
- Thank you.
- I am. I'm very happy for you.

14:08.320 --> 14:09.446
Want a little more?

14:09.600 --> 14:10.726
Oh, please.

14:11.320 --> 14:12.481
No problem.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.367
So you never see anybody
from high school?

14:16.600 --> 14:18.300
What about Greg? Greg Pierson.

14:18.400 --> 14:22.500
No, I really, I haven't talked to anybody
since the day we graduated.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.140
You want more pasta?

14:24.240 --> 14:25.605
- Oh, no, I'm fine.
- You sure?

14:25.760 --> 14:27.060
You were such good friends.

14:27.160 --> 14:28.321
Not sure he needs any more of that.

14:28.440 --> 14:29.441
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:29.560 --> 14:30.561
Okay.

14:30.680 --> 14:35.004
So, Simon, Robyn says that
you work in security systems.

14:35.640 --> 14:37.802
Yeah, security for large corporations.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.700
Like in, you know,
information protection.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.060
Yeah. Complicated stuff.

14:42.160 --> 14:43.900
- Complicated?
- Yeah, but I only sell it.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.580
I don't know how to use it.

14:45.680 --> 14:47.682
We're developing more
and more for personal use,

14:47.800 --> 14:49.768
not just the corporate sector.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.929
Kind of widening out.

14:52.320 --> 14:55.420
And what do you think about this
whole government thing of, you know,

14:55.520 --> 14:57.363
listening in to people's
private information?

14:57.480 --> 15:00.324
- I mean, that's crazy stuff.
- Who knows?

15:00.440 --> 15:02.568
I mean, fuck them, you know?

15:03.200 --> 15:05.202
An eye for an eye, I say.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.167
Yeah.

15:09.320 --> 15:11.607
Anyway, this is a conversation
for another time.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.485
But speaking of government,

15:14.640 --> 15:18.660
did you know that
Simon was class president?

15:18.760 --> 15:21.540
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I did.

15:21.640 --> 15:22.926
Mr. President.

15:23.160 --> 15:24.420
Please, people will think he's...

15:24.520 --> 15:29.162
He had a very organized campaign,
"Simon Says."

15:29.320 --> 15:30.460
Like the children's game.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.562
Well, his campaign
was based around the game,

15:32.680 --> 15:35.684
so Simon says, and it would happen.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.580
"I will make it happen."
Simon says, "More time for sports."

15:40.680 --> 15:42.660
Simon says, "More
choice in the cafeteria."

15:42.760 --> 15:43.980
And it happens.

15:44.080 --> 15:45.580
She gets it. You got it, right?

15:45.680 --> 15:48.900
So is it, do you have, like, a poster?

15:49.000 --> 15:50.780
Posters. Leaflets.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.041
- Buttons.
- Buttons?

15:52.160 --> 15:53.260
Parades...

15:53.360 --> 15:57.206
Simon says, "New job." Right?

15:57.320 --> 16:02.260
- Simon says, "Beautiful wife and a new home."
- Aww.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.780
Well, see? Should have
no problems starting a family.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.848
Because Simon says.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.803
My God, I had one too many wines.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.729
- I just talk way too much then.
- No.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.444
- No.
- No, I talked too much.

16:17.560 --> 16:21.360
What's happened to you
since high school? Everything good?

16:22.200 --> 16:23.406
Military.

16:23.920 --> 16:25.126
- Yeah.
- Really?

16:25.240 --> 16:28.460
Yeah, it's true.
Military, straight out of school.

16:28.560 --> 16:32.281
Two tours, and then I got out of there,

16:32.400 --> 16:35.051
and just ended up doing a lot of things.

16:35.400 --> 16:38.660
But, I mean, a whole lot has happened
to me since we last saw each other.

16:38.760 --> 16:42.100
Some good, some bad, like life.
You know, mostly good.

16:42.200 --> 16:45.283
But, you know, I believe
that a lot of the good

16:45.400 --> 16:47.980
- could come from the bad, you know?
- I hear you.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.321
If you put the right
faith behind it, you know?

16:50.440 --> 16:53.250
Not to bring religion into it, God,

16:54.240 --> 16:57.847
but just to say that the bad things,
they can be a gift.

16:57.960 --> 17:01.340
- Absolutely.
- And that's just the way I like to see things.

17:01.440 --> 17:02.771
Yeah, that's good.

17:04.319 --> 17:08.769
Hey, I'm very happy for you.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.404
Thank you very much.

17:15.960 --> 17:18.849
I am. Very, very,
very happy for you and...

17:21.760 --> 17:23.762
So I'd like to make a toast.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.484
Simon says a toast.

17:25.599 --> 17:28.540
- Gordo says a toast.
- Gordo says a toast.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.847
To old friends and...

17:30.960 --> 17:32.883
- New ones.
- New friends.

17:35.280 --> 17:36.361
Thank you.

17:37.920 --> 17:39.410
Are you okay?

17:39.640 --> 17:42.371
Yeah. Yeah, sorry, I was just thinking.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.700
You know, it's so amazing
how some people change

17:44.800 --> 17:47.740
so much after high school
and some just stay exactly the same.

17:47.840 --> 17:50.491
You know what I mean?
I feel kind of bad for him.

17:50.640 --> 17:54.420
Did he seem right to you?
That guy is odd.

17:54.520 --> 17:56.220
He is a little socially awkward,

17:56.320 --> 17:58.766
but, I mean, I can be that way.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.651
I think that guy's delusional.

18:02.120 --> 18:04.088
He thinks we're friends.

18:04.840 --> 18:08.287
The whole thing just has me
very uncomfortable, but...

18:09.400 --> 18:10.686
Okay.

18:11.520 --> 18:14.020
It was just one dinner and it's over.

18:14.120 --> 18:15.645
No one's saying you have to do it again.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.120
- I just feel bad.
- Yeah.

18:18.240 --> 18:19.685
Can I have that sponge, please?

18:21.200 --> 18:22.884
Aren't you forgetting something?

18:25.840 --> 18:27.205
Simon says.

18:29.800 --> 18:31.006
No.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.780
...introduce you to some
of the members of the team.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.940
- You might recognize your new bosses.
- Hi.

18:41.040 --> 18:42.530
They wanted to be here
to welcome you in person,

18:42.680 --> 18:44.820
but they are in Tokyo
looking to expand the empire.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.300
- Danny!
- How are you?

18:46.400 --> 18:47.925
- Simon, this is Danny McDonald.
- Hello.

18:48.040 --> 18:48.980
- Hi.
- He runs Legal.

18:49.080 --> 18:50.660
Simon. This is my wife, Robyn.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.460
- Robyn, hi.
- And his lovely wife, Gina.

18:52.560 --> 18:55.100
It's Janine, actually,
but she'll answer to anything.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.281
Great.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.731
Guys, let me bring you
through to meet my wife.

18:57.840 --> 18:58.940
- Nice to meet you guys.
- Good to see you, Danny.

18:59.040 --> 19:01.260
- Hey, so this... Guys, this is my wife. Duffy.
- Hi.

19:01.360 --> 19:02.600
Hi. I've heard so much about you.

19:02.720 --> 19:03.960
Hi there, Duffy, my wife, Robyn.

19:04.080 --> 19:05.300
- Hello, Robyn.
- Hello, you're so pretty.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.780
- Hi, there.
- And this is, of course, Wendy Dale.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.980
She's spearheading
Mergers and Acquisitions.

19:10.080 --> 19:11.980
Can I grab two of those? Here.

19:12.080 --> 19:16.290
Let's kick this party off with a toast
here to welcome the new blood.

19:16.560 --> 19:18.860
- I don't actually...
- She's the designated driver, so...

19:18.960 --> 19:20.340
- I'm so sorry. I'll take it.
- Two for me.

19:20.440 --> 19:22.300
Or you can take it. There we go.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.084
What do you do, Robyn?

19:24.200 --> 19:26.260
She's a brilliant designer, right?

19:26.360 --> 19:28.140
Tell them. Brag. Brag a little bit.

19:28.240 --> 19:29.820
She's very, very good.

19:29.920 --> 19:33.660
No, I freelance
a little for consulting firms.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.380
She's being modest.

19:35.480 --> 19:37.323
She was running a big firm in Chicago,

19:37.440 --> 19:39.220
which is happening
online for the moment,

19:39.320 --> 19:42.700
and she's designing the interiors
of the home we just moved into right now.

19:42.800 --> 19:44.620
- That's a big job. Yeah. Great.
- Great.

19:44.720 --> 19:47.929
We're also very busy working
on trying to start a family,

19:48.080 --> 19:49.220
- and that takes a lot of time.
- Oh.

19:49.320 --> 19:50.481
- Congratulations.
- Yeah.

19:55.160 --> 19:56.161
Oh.

19:57.960 --> 19:59.610
What do you think?

20:00.600 --> 20:02.340
- Very nice.
- Isn't it?

20:02.440 --> 20:04.169
- Yeah.
- You should see upstairs.

20:04.280 --> 20:06.123
You should see Kevin's
office. That's nice.

20:06.280 --> 20:08.123
- Uh-huh.
- But this is, it's pretty great.

20:08.680 --> 20:11.081
Yeah. Here they are.

20:11.520 --> 20:13.807
I cannot believe these
guys are your bosses.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.900
You are my boss, honey. Let's be clear.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.540
These guys just run the billion dollar
company I work for.

20:20.640 --> 20:24.380
You know they've been multimillionaires
since they were teenagers? Mmm-hmm.

20:24.480 --> 20:25.720
Crazy.

20:26.560 --> 20:29.620
Yeah, once upon a time,
the crusty old men ran the companies

20:29.720 --> 20:31.380
and the teenagers
were down in the mail room.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.323
And now it's the total opposite.

20:33.920 --> 20:36.540
But I'm going to make it upstairs
before I'm too old,

20:36.640 --> 20:40.420
as long as Kevin sticks to his plan
of moving on at the end of the year.

20:40.520 --> 20:43.888
Then I get a little bit of consulting
expertise from you, I'll be all set.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.527
Keep growing the beard.
Start wearing sneakers to work.

20:47.920 --> 20:49.888
- Maybe get a tattoo.
- Yeah.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.570
All good ideas.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.003
I'd look good in those glasses, I think.

20:55.720 --> 21:00.681
Hey, do you really not
want me to go back to work?

21:01.920 --> 21:03.580
- Are you still worried?
- That's not what I said.

21:03.680 --> 21:04.740
- No?
- No.

21:04.840 --> 21:06.649
You know, we moved to the suburbs and...

21:06.760 --> 21:08.500
Yeah. For a fresh start.

21:08.600 --> 21:12.207
Honey, I want you to do
whatever you want to do.

21:12.760 --> 21:14.140
As long as you stay healthy,

21:14.240 --> 21:17.620
you can open an office
in every major city in the world.

21:17.720 --> 21:21.566
I want you to start rebuilding the business.
You know, what do I care?

21:21.680 --> 21:24.604
I just don't want you
to be stressed, honey,

21:25.520 --> 21:29.047
because that's when those
other things can happen. Yeah?

21:30.200 --> 21:31.770
Especially if you really
want to start a family.

21:31.880 --> 21:33.405
Okay.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.688
- Did it sound that bad?
- No.

21:36.200 --> 21:37.780
No, I'm just being silly.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.041
Let's get back to the party.

21:39.160 --> 21:40.241
Okay.

21:40.560 --> 21:41.940
- They're charming. Right?
- Yeah.

21:42.040 --> 21:45.300
And they'll probably have good
dirty jokes every once in a while.

21:45.400 --> 21:46.970
What have we got?

21:54.080 --> 21:55.241
Here.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.450
Uh-oh. "Thanks for a lovely dinner.

21:59.560 --> 22:00.860
- "Return the favor."
- No.

22:00.960 --> 22:02.644
"Hope you don't mind."

22:03.160 --> 22:04.446
Smiley face.

22:06.600 --> 22:07.900
Fish food.

22:10.920 --> 22:11.967
Oh.

22:21.600 --> 22:22.647
Oh, no.

22:25.080 --> 22:27.606
Well, we have to thank him this time.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.180
For what? Coming onto
our property without asking?

22:31.280 --> 22:33.169
No. This is not troubling to you?

22:33.280 --> 22:35.740
I really don't think that he
meant it to be troubling.

22:35.840 --> 22:38.161
He wouldn't see it like that, he just...

22:38.280 --> 22:41.011
He just thinks he's giving us some fish.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.682
You know, they used to
call him Weirdo in school.

22:46.280 --> 22:48.282
Gordo the Weirdo.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.380
That's not very nice.

22:50.480 --> 22:52.164
Everybody had a name.

22:52.960 --> 22:54.724
I was Simple Simon.

22:55.680 --> 22:57.569
Yeah. Kids.

22:58.160 --> 22:59.810
Kids are mean.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.485
Kids are honest.

23:03.480 --> 23:05.403
Why do you get a name like Weirdo?

23:06.040 --> 23:07.041
Hmm?

23:08.360 --> 23:10.522
Well, I think that he's misunderstood.

23:11.560 --> 23:12.900
- Maybe.
- Mmm.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.260
It's not our job to
figure out what he is.

23:15.360 --> 23:16.460
Sure.

23:16.560 --> 23:18.980
I can tell you he's a reverse thief.

23:19.080 --> 23:21.811
Breaking in to give us something?
It's not very bright.

23:21.920 --> 23:23.081
Right. Mmm-hmm.

23:23.640 --> 23:27.645
I hope his next gift
is a sushi knife for those fish.

23:30.360 --> 23:32.089
You got a new friend.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.100
Ha-ha.

23:34.200 --> 23:35.980
Someone's got a buddy.

23:36.080 --> 23:37.081
Mmm-hmm.

24:21.040 --> 24:24.487
Hi. I was in the area.
I was wondering, is... Oh.

24:24.640 --> 24:25.926
Hey.

24:26.080 --> 24:28.890
Is Simon home?

24:29.480 --> 24:32.051
No. He's at work. Yeah.

24:34.480 --> 24:37.930
I wanted to call you, actually,
to say thank you for what you did.

24:38.080 --> 24:41.289
The fish are beautiful.
Really beautiful. Thank you.

24:42.600 --> 24:46.286
Well, ask and thou shall receive,
huh, Mr. Bojangles?

24:46.680 --> 24:49.420
You know, most people think
that Sammy Davis Jr. or Nina Simone

24:49.520 --> 24:51.820
wrote Mr. Bojangles,
but it's actually written by a guy

24:51.920 --> 24:55.402
called Jerry Jeff Walker
who hardly anybody knows about.

24:56.080 --> 24:57.491
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:58.160 --> 24:59.366
Did not know that.

25:00.400 --> 25:03.085
My dad named him, actually.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.251
- Well.
- Yeah.

25:14.800 --> 25:18.441
I was just about to make a pot of tea.
Do you drink tea?

25:18.920 --> 25:20.260
- Yeah.
- Well, come in.

25:20.360 --> 25:21.566
You can leave a note for Simon.

25:21.680 --> 25:22.886
Okay.

25:27.600 --> 25:30.380
I guess I speak to
some girls from high school,

25:30.480 --> 25:31.860
the ones I was closest to.

25:31.960 --> 25:35.009
Most of them, most of them
have children now.

25:35.720 --> 25:37.927
Yep, that ought to do it.

25:39.840 --> 25:41.330
Right, let's see.

25:42.800 --> 25:44.848
- 40% less than the big-box guys!
- Hey.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.740
Choose your favorite way
to save even more...

25:46.840 --> 25:48.740
Simon's going to love you for this.

25:48.840 --> 25:52.208
...save 25% in finance,
interest free for 24 months,

25:52.320 --> 25:55.020
or save 20% in financing,
interest free for 36 months.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.805
What do you usually watch at this hour?

25:58.320 --> 26:01.324
Oh, nothing. I should be working.

26:01.840 --> 26:03.922
Like, really, I should get back to work.

26:04.080 --> 26:06.162
Oh, of course. Sorry.

26:06.720 --> 26:08.688
Thank you though.
Really, so much for this.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.980
It's a pleasure.
You know, they really make it seem,

26:11.080 --> 26:14.100
you know, far more complicated
than it really should be.

26:14.200 --> 26:15.440
Hey, leave that. I will do it.

26:15.560 --> 26:17.380
- No, it's fine, really. Really.
- You've already done too much.

26:17.480 --> 26:18.811
Where do these live?

26:19.680 --> 26:22.251
In the drawer under the microwave.

26:22.880 --> 26:23.900
Oh.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.287
And the trash goes...

26:31.000 --> 26:32.684
Trash goes outside.

26:44.920 --> 26:47.571
Normally, friendships grow organically.

26:47.680 --> 26:51.100
And if they don't serve both parties,
they just kind of organically dissipate.

26:51.200 --> 26:53.300
Yeah, that'd be great.

26:53.400 --> 26:56.420
What you're talking about is,
you know, an asymmetric thing.

26:56.520 --> 26:58.329
A one-sided friendship?

26:58.800 --> 27:00.928
I mean, essentially you're being
forced into a breakup.

27:01.040 --> 27:02.660
- Yeah.
- No. No.

27:02.760 --> 27:05.491
Although no, no, no. To be fair,
this guy actually sounds like an asset,

27:05.600 --> 27:07.020
so I think you should
let him finish the house

27:07.120 --> 27:09.860
and finish the garden and then
you cut the fucking guy loose.

27:09.960 --> 27:12.327
You know what,
I actually think he's nice.

27:12.440 --> 27:14.044
And he's been very generous.

27:16.920 --> 27:19.460
So then he saw the thing
that you wrote and then, what?

27:19.560 --> 27:21.608
Yeah. So get this for confusing.

27:21.720 --> 27:24.740
After he'd supposedly been offended
by what I wrote on the board,

27:24.840 --> 27:27.660
he calls us a few hours later on the phone
and he invites us to a dinner party.

27:27.760 --> 27:29.300
- At his house.
- Alone?

27:29.400 --> 27:30.780
No. With another couple.

27:30.880 --> 27:33.020
Well, surely you're not going
to accept the invitation.

27:33.120 --> 27:36.340
After the whole insult thing,
I'm surprised he wants you around at all.

27:36.440 --> 27:38.540
Unless he wants
to chop you guys up with an axe.

27:38.640 --> 27:41.300
Yeah. Maybe he didn't see
what you wrote.

27:41.400 --> 27:43.129
No, I'm pretty sure that he did.

27:43.240 --> 27:44.924
Maybe he doesn't care.

27:45.240 --> 27:47.447
Or he cares more about...

27:47.920 --> 27:49.020
To not worry about it.

27:49.120 --> 27:51.361
In this guy's defense,
she is way too nice, right?

27:51.480 --> 27:52.580
- Yes.
- You two know that.

27:52.680 --> 27:55.286
You're a bit of a door-half-open
kind of person?

27:55.440 --> 27:57.900
I love you for it, but you know.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.809
You could just politely decline,

27:59.920 --> 28:01.729
and then not offer another alternative.

28:01.840 --> 28:03.649
But he would offer
an alternative, you know?

28:03.760 --> 28:06.500
He'll keep coming around
and around and around, so...

28:06.600 --> 28:10.180
So basically, eventually,
you two need to have a conversation.

28:10.280 --> 28:12.300
That's what I'm thinking.
That's why I'm considering it.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.528
I think you guys should be careful.

28:15.520 --> 28:17.060
- Yeah.
- I wouldn't accept.

28:17.160 --> 28:18.340
No. Me neither.

28:18.440 --> 28:22.604
Well, I for one, would love to know
what happens if you do go.

28:22.720 --> 28:24.006
Stop it.

28:24.120 --> 28:25.451
As I said, I doubt we will.

28:37.160 --> 28:39.322
Let's just try to
have a nice time, okay?

28:40.000 --> 28:41.331
Yeah.

28:44.360 --> 28:45.691
Holy shit.

28:46.280 --> 28:47.281
Wow.

28:50.680 --> 28:52.205
Got the right address, huh?

28:52.320 --> 28:53.810
Yeah. I think so.

28:54.160 --> 28:55.366
Ridiculous.

29:00.040 --> 29:01.246
Guess we're first, too.

29:01.360 --> 29:02.566
Yeah.

29:07.680 --> 29:08.780
Hi.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.300
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:10.400 --> 29:11.890
- Got you something.
- Oh.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.764
- Yeah.
- Wow. Thank you.

29:14.160 --> 29:15.366
- Good to see you.
- Come on in.

29:15.520 --> 29:17.682
- Robyn, you look lovely.
- Thank you.

29:18.240 --> 29:20.060
This is some place you've got.

29:20.160 --> 29:23.721
Wow. Yeah. It is something.

29:23.840 --> 29:25.660
- Very impressive.
- Good for you, Gordo.

29:25.760 --> 29:27.842
Gosh. Got a fire.

29:31.560 --> 29:33.260
What an incredible place.

29:33.360 --> 29:36.682
So, hey, take a seat, and why don't...

29:37.400 --> 29:39.209
- Let's have a drink.
- What's this?

29:39.720 --> 29:41.860
Oh, that's a gift. That's for you.

29:41.960 --> 29:42.961
Huh.

29:43.880 --> 29:45.564
What did you get?

29:45.880 --> 29:47.340
Ooh. Great movie.

29:47.440 --> 29:49.044
- Apocalypse Now, huh?
- Yeah.

29:49.360 --> 29:52.300
It's going to be great
on your speaker system.

29:52.400 --> 29:54.860
When The Ride of the Valkyries comes on,

29:54.960 --> 29:58.580
it's going to sound like the choppers
are going from left to right. Like...

30:03.120 --> 30:04.780
You know, around the room, see?

30:04.880 --> 30:05.927
Yeah.

30:06.560 --> 30:09.500
That's going to be amazing.
Thank you so much.

30:09.600 --> 30:13.300
So, I guess Simon, red wine?

30:13.400 --> 30:14.540
- Yes, please.
- Right.

30:14.640 --> 30:16.300
Robyn? You don't drink?

30:16.400 --> 30:18.500
- No. I don't.
- Water's fine?

30:18.600 --> 30:20.140
- I got juice?
- Oh, no, water's fine.

30:20.240 --> 30:21.860
- Gatorade?
- No, water is fine.

30:21.960 --> 30:23.166
Okay.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.608
So the other couple, do we know them?

30:25.760 --> 30:27.180
- Are they friends of yours?
- Yeah.

30:27.280 --> 30:30.921
Yeah, they just literally canceled.

30:31.440 --> 30:34.284
They had a babysitter, I guess. She...

30:34.520 --> 30:37.126
Lined up, and then she fell through.

30:37.480 --> 30:40.900
So it's just us three.
Or is your wife going to join us?

30:41.000 --> 30:41.980
Are you married?

30:42.080 --> 30:43.740
I don't know if I ever asked you
if you were married.

30:43.840 --> 30:47.287
That's a long story. I forgot crackers.

30:48.600 --> 30:51.683
Yeah, that's a long story.
The short version is no.

30:52.360 --> 30:53.441
Crackers.

30:53.600 --> 30:54.647
Not married.

30:55.600 --> 30:57.170
- Hello?
- Okay.

30:58.320 --> 30:59.606
What do you want?

31:01.160 --> 31:04.528
I'm with, uh, people.

31:04.640 --> 31:05.846
That salami looks good, huh?

31:05.960 --> 31:08.122
Hey, be nice. He's made an effort.

31:08.880 --> 31:10.530
I'm really sorry.

31:11.360 --> 31:12.725
That's an urgent work thing.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.740
I'm going to have to step out
for a couple of minutes,

31:14.840 --> 31:15.900
but it's not going to take me long.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.100
I'll literally be less than five minutes.
Less than that.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.380
Can you just relax? Have a drink?

31:21.480 --> 31:24.380
I'll be back as soon
as I can, I'm sorry.

31:27.320 --> 31:28.526
Gordo?

31:28.880 --> 31:30.928
Did he just leave us here?

31:32.800 --> 31:34.962
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I think he did.

31:35.200 --> 31:38.780
- Is his car...
- He's leaving us alone in his house?

31:38.880 --> 31:40.370
He doesn't even know us.

31:40.480 --> 31:42.244
- Yeah, well...
- What?

31:42.720 --> 31:44.688
Maybe it's an emergency.

31:45.640 --> 31:47.369
Well, he did say it
was an urgent work thing.

31:47.480 --> 31:51.405
What is it that he even does?
This is... This is...

31:51.840 --> 31:54.100
Bizarre... Would we ever do this?

31:54.200 --> 31:58.569
Well, no, but technically
I would be at home to

31:58.680 --> 32:00.620
look after guests if you
had to go somewhere.

32:00.720 --> 32:02.980
- He hasn't got anyone, a wife or...
- Honey, don't defend him.

32:03.080 --> 32:04.286
Or whatever.

32:04.400 --> 32:05.660
I'll tell you why he
doesn't have a wife.

32:05.760 --> 32:07.140
He'd like to be married to you.

32:07.240 --> 32:08.420
He'd like you to be his wife.

32:08.520 --> 32:10.260
- Oh, God, Simon.
- Yep.

32:10.360 --> 32:13.523
Come on, honey. This guy likes you
so much. Tell me you don't see it.

32:13.640 --> 32:16.100
- Come on.
- I really don't think that is the reason why.

32:16.200 --> 32:17.690
Come on, honey.

32:18.040 --> 32:20.930
Why all the drop in's and the stop by's

32:21.040 --> 32:22.565
only when you're home alone?

32:22.680 --> 32:24.808
Look at this thing. Good Lord.

32:24.920 --> 32:26.500
I think you're slightly exaggerating.

32:26.600 --> 32:28.300
I think he's obsessed with you, honey.

32:28.400 --> 32:30.260
I think he wants to nail you.

32:30.360 --> 32:31.500
I think he wants to be me,

32:31.600 --> 32:32.700
- wants to move into the house...
- Stop it.

32:32.800 --> 32:34.780
He wants to play mommies
and daddies with you,

32:34.880 --> 32:35.980
the creepy little fucker.

32:36.080 --> 32:38.003
Simon, don't be crass.

32:38.400 --> 32:40.846
I'm Gordo the Weirdo.

32:40.960 --> 32:45.380
And I want to make crazy,
weird love to you,

32:45.480 --> 32:47.140
with my creepy,

32:47.240 --> 32:52.121
with my creepy little
pee-pee pleasey-weasy.

32:52.240 --> 32:53.340
- Put it away.
- I'm Gordo the Weirdo

32:53.440 --> 32:55.500
- and I want you all to myself.
- I don't like it. No.

32:55.600 --> 32:56.601
- Can I have you?
- No.

32:56.720 --> 32:58.006
- Can I have you, please? Why not?
- No, no! Please!

32:58.120 --> 33:00.600
- Why not?
- Because you're disgusting.

33:01.720 --> 33:03.370
He is disgusting.

33:04.240 --> 33:06.083
Disgusting and weird.

33:06.400 --> 33:09.483
Let's just check this place out.
Come on. Come on.

33:12.080 --> 33:13.241
Okay.

33:14.920 --> 33:16.285
Simon?

33:21.840 --> 33:25.447
Simon, he could come back any second.
What are you doing?

33:38.920 --> 33:40.524
He's not married, huh?

33:44.440 --> 33:46.900
Maybe it's just his spring stuff.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.684
Look, I think we should
go back downstairs

33:48.800 --> 33:51.804
- before he comes back.
- What have we got down here?

33:54.160 --> 33:56.340
Simon?

33:56.440 --> 33:58.647
- You hear that?
- What is it?

34:16.880 --> 34:18.643
Ugh, monkeys.

34:21.360 --> 34:22.725
He's a dad?

34:23.440 --> 34:24.440
Hmm.

34:26.480 --> 34:27.891
Shit, shit. Shit, shit.

34:28.159 --> 34:30.481
Wait, wait! Simon!

34:37.880 --> 34:40.167
- Drink some of your drink.
- What?

34:41.040 --> 34:42.060
- Hey.
- Hi.

34:42.159 --> 34:43.764
Everything okay?

34:44.480 --> 34:45.659
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

34:45.760 --> 34:48.570
That was, yeah, I'm sorry about that.

34:48.679 --> 34:51.251
- Yeah, what was that? That was...
- Yeah, what happened?

34:53.000 --> 34:54.889
Don't worry about it.

34:55.679 --> 34:57.808
Hey, what is it that you do?

34:58.360 --> 35:01.500
I mean, the reason that you left.
The work thing.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.011
I don't think I've ever asked you that.

35:03.120 --> 35:06.283
What is it that you...
What do you actually do?

35:06.560 --> 35:09.420
What do you do to afford all of this?

35:09.520 --> 35:10.726
Simon.

35:11.080 --> 35:12.684
Are you not curious?

35:17.440 --> 35:20.011
I'm afraid that you've
caught me in a lie.

35:22.680 --> 35:23.727
A lie?

35:28.960 --> 35:31.440
I wasn't dealing with a work thing.

35:34.480 --> 35:37.324
I was out speaking to my ex-wife,

35:39.040 --> 35:40.849
who recently left me.

35:42.880 --> 35:46.965
Actually, a couple of days before
I saw you at the Homeware store.

35:47.760 --> 35:52.243
And we have a couple of beautiful children,
and she's taken both of them.

35:52.760 --> 35:58.403
And I don't really mention it
because it makes me very upset

35:59.280 --> 36:02.300
and I don't really know
what's going to happen.

36:02.400 --> 36:05.051
And obviously I really
want to make it work

36:05.160 --> 36:07.766
and I don't really
know what the chances are.

36:08.280 --> 36:11.762
And, technically, this is her home,

36:12.080 --> 36:15.527
her family home, so it's their money.

36:15.960 --> 36:18.340
And at the moment,
she holds all the cards

36:18.440 --> 36:22.331
so when she says jump, I have to...

36:22.600 --> 36:23.761
Jump.

36:23.880 --> 36:25.041
Jump. Um...

36:25.600 --> 36:30.060
Which is why I went out there
to speak to her on the phone,

36:30.160 --> 36:32.460
because I didn't want you both

36:32.560 --> 36:35.882
to hear the conversation
which gets a little heated.

36:36.440 --> 36:39.340
And just listening to me speak,

36:39.440 --> 36:41.283
I feel very embarrassed right now.

36:43.280 --> 36:44.520
I'm sorry.

36:45.120 --> 36:47.282
Well, don't be embarrassed.

36:48.040 --> 36:49.620
It's really okay.

36:49.720 --> 36:51.449
Well, I lied to you.

36:52.640 --> 36:56.964
Listen, hey, why don't we,
why don't we eat?

36:57.120 --> 36:58.380
- Well, I...
- Yes, sure.

36:58.480 --> 37:02.565
Actually why don't... I think
you and I should have a little talk.

37:04.880 --> 37:06.962
Honey, can you give us
a couple of minutes, please?

37:08.000 --> 37:09.206
Here.

37:09.320 --> 37:11.140
Can you just go wait
out in the car for me, please?

37:11.240 --> 37:13.527
Just give me like five minutes,
I'll be right out.

37:13.640 --> 37:17.008
- Then we're going to go home, okay?
- Okay.

37:18.640 --> 37:20.165
I'm so sorry.

37:21.680 --> 37:24.365
- This is...
- Is everything okay because...

37:24.480 --> 37:25.820
Yeah. Hang on one second.

37:27.880 --> 37:31.168
So this is a very, very...

37:31.600 --> 37:33.011
There's no easy way to say this.

37:33.120 --> 37:34.565
Well, I mean, just say whatever...

37:34.680 --> 37:38.860
Don't interrupt me,
because I gotta power right through it

37:38.960 --> 37:41.380
and then you can talk
right afterwards, okay?

37:41.480 --> 37:42.580
Okay.

37:42.680 --> 37:47.971
I think that we would prefer
that you don't visit us anymore.

37:49.520 --> 37:51.841
You know, you should take some time

37:52.040 --> 37:54.361
with this thing that
you just told us about.

37:54.840 --> 37:57.420
That's heavy stuff, you know? This is...

37:57.520 --> 37:58.806
Honey?

37:59.520 --> 38:02.603
Please, can you just give
us a couple of minutes?

38:03.360 --> 38:05.060
- Okay.
- Thank you.

38:05.160 --> 38:06.571
Two minutes.

38:41.520 --> 38:42.601
Okay, I did it.

38:46.040 --> 38:49.522
Sometimes you just gotta
rip off the Band-Aid, right?

39:02.200 --> 39:03.440
Come on.

39:05.320 --> 39:06.970
Is this guy playing games?

39:08.080 --> 39:09.220
Oh, come on.

39:09.320 --> 39:10.401
Should I...

39:17.040 --> 39:19.140
Open the goddamn gate.

39:19.240 --> 39:20.740
- Okay, Simon.
- Wait here.

39:20.840 --> 39:22.444
Simon, hold on, maybe he'll...

39:36.120 --> 39:37.121
Si.

40:05.280 --> 40:09.171
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

40:59.240 --> 41:00.571
Pardon me, one second.

41:01.360 --> 41:02.540
Honey, is everything all right?

41:02.640 --> 41:05.246
I'm right in the middle of a...

41:07.680 --> 41:09.330
Are you serious?

41:13.360 --> 41:14.740
Don't touch them,

41:14.840 --> 41:16.763
and don't touch the water.

41:36.560 --> 41:38.380
Jangles is gone.

41:38.480 --> 41:41.484
I've been looking.
I can't find him anywhere.

41:47.240 --> 41:49.004
That son of a bitch.

41:53.960 --> 41:56.531
Son of a bitch. All right,
I'll be right back.

42:24.120 --> 42:25.485
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.167
I need to speak to Gordo.

42:28.280 --> 42:30.442
- I think you have the wrong house.
- No, no.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.060
I got the right place.
I just need to speak to him, please.

42:33.160 --> 42:34.980
- Speak to who?
- Gordo. Your husband.

42:35.080 --> 42:36.540
Gordon. Get him down here.

42:36.640 --> 42:37.766
My husband's name is Mike.

42:37.880 --> 42:39.041
Mike?

42:48.000 --> 42:50.207
Okay. I got that, yeah.

42:51.120 --> 42:52.100
Okay.

42:52.200 --> 42:55.886
The dog's tag says Mr. Bojangles?

42:56.640 --> 42:58.260
Like the song?

42:58.360 --> 43:00.700
Yeah. But he responds to Jangles.

43:00.800 --> 43:01.801
Hmm.

43:02.200 --> 43:03.440
So they knew him.

43:03.800 --> 43:06.580
Well, the husband did, Mr. Ryan.

43:06.680 --> 43:08.820
He has a fleet of limousines and cars

43:08.920 --> 43:11.620
for an executive transport service
business type thing or what not,

43:11.720 --> 43:13.580
and he leased a car to Mr. Mosley.

43:13.680 --> 43:16.286
Now Mr. Ryan says that Mr. Mosley

43:16.400 --> 43:18.900
actually had access to his garage

43:19.000 --> 43:21.540
so that he could pick up
and return a Cadillac,

43:21.640 --> 43:25.380
which is probably how he gained
access to the main house,

43:25.480 --> 43:27.926
and why he knew the Ryans
were on vacation in Cancún.

43:28.040 --> 43:30.964
But I assume he won't be
working as a driver anymore.

43:31.080 --> 43:33.420
They could press more
serious charges if they wanted.

43:33.520 --> 43:37.180
Um, the dog is what I'm concerned with.

43:37.280 --> 43:40.204
Yeah, it really could just be
that it's a new neighborhood for him

43:40.320 --> 43:41.820
- and we did leave the gate open.
- No. No.

43:41.920 --> 43:43.888
Who killed the fish then, honey?

43:44.520 --> 43:48.140
He took the dog, I think.
Pretty sure he took the dog.

43:48.240 --> 43:50.020
Well, you know, that's a tricky one

43:50.120 --> 43:52.900
because I can go there and see him,
but that's not the problem.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.241
- You know where he lives?
- We can find that out.

43:55.680 --> 43:57.603
But the problem is,
I just can't go there

43:57.720 --> 43:59.620
and look inside without a warrant.

43:59.720 --> 44:01.780
And to get a warrant,
I need proof of some kind,

44:01.880 --> 44:03.780
- which neither of us have.
- Well...

44:03.880 --> 44:07.620
Which just leaves me
with that awkward task

44:07.720 --> 44:10.300
of paying him a visit and asking,
"Did you take the dog?"

44:10.400 --> 44:13.529
and asking him did he take
the dog means that,

44:14.200 --> 44:19.525
well, he's going to know who sent me.

45:00.120 --> 45:01.246
Hello?

45:27.640 --> 45:29.860
Well, I mean, if you think
he's a threat or whatever,

45:29.960 --> 45:32.220
I'm happy to go over
there and take a look.

45:32.320 --> 45:35.642
No. No, really. It's nothing.

45:36.680 --> 45:39.420
Do you think he would
actually do this though?

45:39.520 --> 45:40.885
I mean, take your dog?

45:41.040 --> 45:44.840
I really don't want to
believe that he would.

45:46.520 --> 45:47.740
But who knows? Like I said,

45:47.840 --> 45:49.780
it's probably all in my head.

45:49.880 --> 45:52.660
I mean, I have been
having trouble sleeping.

45:58.400 --> 46:01.660
Thank you, but I don't want to impose.

46:01.760 --> 46:03.420
- I should go.
- Hey. Don't be silly.

46:03.520 --> 46:05.700
It's fine. You're not imposing.

46:05.800 --> 46:07.529
You're a welcome distraction, honestly.

46:07.640 --> 46:09.847
Have some coffee and I'll check on her.
I'll be back.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.420
- Thank you.
- Sure.

46:12.520 --> 46:14.329
Can I use your bathroom?

47:52.120 --> 47:54.088
Hey? Simon?

47:55.120 --> 47:56.451
Hey.

49:14.480 --> 49:15.766
Hey.

49:16.080 --> 49:17.366
Hey.

49:31.720 --> 49:34.849
I think it's him.
I think he's messing with us.

49:50.600 --> 49:53.206
Where have you been?

50:09.960 --> 50:11.405
Hey.

50:22.120 --> 50:24.122
Dear Robyn and Simon,

50:24.720 --> 50:27.405
I guess I owe you both an apology.

50:28.960 --> 50:31.770
It seems I have misjudged our situation.

50:32.960 --> 50:36.860
Please know that I would never do
anything to upset you both,

50:36.960 --> 50:39.860
and I really wish I
could start all over again.

50:39.960 --> 50:42.247
However, I will honor your wishes

50:42.360 --> 50:44.647
of leaving you be, i.e., alone.

50:45.520 --> 50:47.540
You won't hear from me again,

50:47.640 --> 50:49.529
except for this letter which I hope...

50:49.640 --> 50:53.929
"...expresses how sorry I am
that things turned out the way they did.

50:54.640 --> 50:56.608
"Gordo." Sad face.

50:56.840 --> 51:01.004
"P.S... I also apologize
about the dinner.

51:01.120 --> 51:03.060
"Without going into detail,

51:03.160 --> 51:07.370
"I think I would feel ashamed
to have you see where I really live.

51:07.800 --> 51:11.805
"I am not exactly the success story
that you both are.

51:12.320 --> 51:13.685
"Stupid me."

51:14.160 --> 51:16.322
No, another sad face.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.490
Two sad faces.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.020
Oy.

51:20.120 --> 51:22.202
Turn it over. There's more.

51:23.680 --> 51:26.820
"P.P.S... Simon, after all these years,

51:26.920 --> 51:32.086
"I really was willing
to let bygones be bygones.

51:33.280 --> 51:35.851
"I had nothing but good intentions."

51:37.160 --> 51:39.686
- What does that mean?
- I do not know.

51:41.240 --> 51:44.100
Really? Well, it must mean something.

51:44.200 --> 51:46.740
I mean, "bygones be bygones,"
"after all these years."

51:46.840 --> 51:48.683
Seriously, I have no idea
what he's talking about.

51:49.160 --> 51:50.161
Huh.

51:52.640 --> 51:55.883
Well, you're not forgetting
that this guy's not exactly stable?

51:56.720 --> 52:00.740
But he seems okay, right?
Other than that?

52:00.840 --> 52:03.820
And we're okay, Jangles is okay,
everybody's okay.

52:03.920 --> 52:06.300
So whatever this was,
let's put it behind us.

52:06.400 --> 52:09.882
Get him out of our minds,
and get on with it.

52:10.400 --> 52:12.289
You know, what do you say?

52:13.400 --> 52:15.860
Question mark, smiley face.

52:54.800 --> 52:56.040
Simon?

53:31.320 --> 53:33.980
...whole semester, I'm still
not going to admit that I did it.

53:34.080 --> 53:37.540
You know, and anyway,
I never waffled. Yeah.

53:37.640 --> 53:40.120
Now I know the guys gotta
catch a plane, so...

53:40.240 --> 53:44.060
Thank you very much for sitting
and looking interested,

53:44.160 --> 53:45.700
- very nice of you.
- I'll catch up with you.

53:45.800 --> 53:47.564
Take care, you guys.

53:49.320 --> 53:50.260
- They loved you.
- That was...

53:50.360 --> 53:52.203
- They loved you.
- That felt pretty good.

53:52.320 --> 53:55.220
Thank you very much for the vote
of confidence too, buddy.

53:55.320 --> 53:57.540
Who else am I up against?
I don't want to get my hopes up,

53:57.640 --> 53:59.220
you don't have to give me names,
but I just wanna know...

53:59.320 --> 54:01.020
I don't mind giving you names.
There's only one other guy.

54:01.120 --> 54:02.780
It's Danny McDonald
from Parker and Fitch.

54:02.880 --> 54:04.220
Just the one?

54:04.320 --> 54:06.561
I smell a promotion for you, buddy.

54:57.680 --> 54:58.886
Hello?

55:22.160 --> 55:23.321
Shoot.

56:13.800 --> 56:15.131
Hi.

56:15.520 --> 56:18.126
Hey, baby. Come on.

56:27.920 --> 56:29.020
Hey.

56:29.120 --> 56:30.610
- Hey.
- Morning.

56:38.200 --> 56:39.500
I got coffee over here, honey.

56:39.600 --> 56:41.220
Come sit down. I want to tell you
this funny story.

56:41.320 --> 56:44.540
The brothers, I guess,
they went to my school.

56:44.640 --> 56:48.725
Same school. Same physics teacher.

56:48.840 --> 56:50.820
This guy, Dr. Elsowet.

56:50.920 --> 56:54.260
And they told me that
he still has the same nickname

56:54.360 --> 56:56.840
that I gave him 10 years ago.
Dr. Smells-a-Bit.

56:58.960 --> 57:02.020
We had a good laugh about it.
Meeting went really, really well.

57:02.120 --> 57:04.361
Kevin is in fact leaving

57:05.080 --> 57:08.090
and they're only looking at one other
guy, so I got a really good shot at it.

57:09.520 --> 57:11.284
That's great, honey.

57:12.160 --> 57:13.525
Yeah, that is great.

57:13.640 --> 57:16.689
I was very excited to share it
with you last night when I got home.

57:16.800 --> 57:20.168
But you were out like a light.

57:25.840 --> 57:27.683
Anything you want to tell me?

57:29.960 --> 57:31.530
Anything at all?

57:36.520 --> 57:37.851
Yeah?

57:38.200 --> 57:40.851
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

57:43.280 --> 57:45.248
I'm glad you said that, 'cause

57:45.960 --> 57:47.530
this was a real bummer to find.

57:49.520 --> 57:52.205
I thought we were done with all of that.

57:52.840 --> 57:54.365
What's going on with you?

57:54.880 --> 57:57.087
I thought we left all
this back in Chicago.

57:57.720 --> 58:00.540
Robyn, you worked real fast here.

58:00.640 --> 58:02.404
You got yourself a doctor too already?

58:02.560 --> 58:04.289
Okay, okay, look.

58:05.840 --> 58:07.524
Simon, I...

58:08.480 --> 58:10.403
I need you to call him.

58:10.560 --> 58:14.700
He made peace with us. I think
that we have to make peace with him.

58:14.800 --> 58:15.860
What's he got to do with that?

58:15.960 --> 58:18.740
'Cause I'm not feeling good right now.

58:18.840 --> 58:21.900
I feel scared when I'm here by myself.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.660
And I keep expecting him to show up.

58:23.760 --> 58:24.980
Why would he?

58:25.080 --> 58:28.402
I don't know. I can't
explain it. But look, I'm...

58:28.920 --> 58:32.322
- It's made me kind of crazy. I...
- Yeah.

58:32.440 --> 58:35.922
- You're probably paranoid from the pills.
- I'm scared. I had a fall.

58:36.920 --> 58:39.082
- A fall.
- I fainted.

58:39.440 --> 58:41.620
Well, that's a shocker, you know,
you're chewing pills.

58:41.720 --> 58:43.660
No, it wasn't because of the pills.

58:43.760 --> 58:45.140
- I didn't take any.
- Are you sure?

58:45.240 --> 58:46.460
No, I didn't take any. No, I wasn't.

58:46.560 --> 58:48.260
Are you mixing this stuff with anything?

58:48.360 --> 58:51.340
This has nothing to do with pills
and no, I'm not mixing anything.

58:51.440 --> 58:53.860
'Cause if you're mixing it with something
it's going to get really dangerous.

58:53.960 --> 58:56.100
Do you want to turn the place
upside down like you did the last one?

58:56.200 --> 58:58.680
Will you please just listen to me?

59:05.800 --> 59:10.761
If we say sorry to him,
we will make this right

59:11.800 --> 59:13.700
and I will feel better.

59:13.800 --> 59:15.450
Robyn, it's over.

59:15.720 --> 59:18.380
I said it, he said it,
he wrote a letter.

59:18.480 --> 59:20.660
Yeah, what about the letter
suggests that it's over?

59:20.760 --> 59:22.000
The whole thing.

59:22.760 --> 59:24.967
What does "bygones be bygones" mean?

59:25.240 --> 59:26.651
Oh, my God.

59:26.760 --> 59:27.780
And Jangles.

59:27.880 --> 59:31.700
I mean, if you still believe
that he took Jangles, which you do,

59:31.800 --> 59:34.260
then it's not over
for him, is it? Is it?

59:34.360 --> 59:35.780
You asked me if there's something
I want to tell you.

59:35.880 --> 59:37.166
...this shit, it's over!

59:37.320 --> 59:38.540
Is there something
that you wanna tell me?

59:38.640 --> 59:41.120
The subject is closed.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.683
Look at what he's done to us.
This is his fault.

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:09.651
It's not my fault, it's not your fault.

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:12.089
That's why we've got to
just put it behind us.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.600
Please.

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:20.648
And time will heal it, okay? Trust me.

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:23.766
Time's going to prove that to you.

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.565
I want you to just look forward

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.485
and be strong.

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:40.460
Time gets rid of a lot of things.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.764
It heals everything.

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:55.082
Let's just get on with doing
what we came here to do.

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.164
Let's make a family.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:03.289
We'll start a new life.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:06.491
A life of our choosing, without him.

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:14.162
It's really important to not look back.

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:54.245
I don't know.

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:56.849
If everything's stripes,
probably not good.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.928
No, it's cute. No.

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:00.780
Listen, so don't look now,

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:04.123
but there is a creepy guy
watching you from outside.

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.484
Yeah. Do you see him? Right there?

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:10.651
Oh, my God.

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:15.121
It's him. It's the guy from before.
The one I told you about.

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.644
Well, Robyn, don't...

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.140
That is good for the winter.
It's for the stroller.

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:30.380
- It's great.
- Yeah.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.686
It goes with the stroller.

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.131
I'm going to take that too.

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.605
Take those ones.

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.900
- What is this? Is this you?
- I don't mean to interrupt.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.580
Look, Mom, sis,
in case you guys are gone

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:40.900
- before I get back.
- Okay, goodbye.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.500
- Goodbye. Have fun, you guys.
- Bye.

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.060
- Bye.
- Don't let Mom drink too much.

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.161
Okay.

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:48.260
Hey, sure. You want me to take that?

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:50.522
We'll just write
that it's Joan on there.

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.044
This one's from me.

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.580
It's just a little something...

01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:00.411
There's a bigger present coming.

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:09.604
He's so mean, and now Henry's
a complete tyrant

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:13.361
and Sunny is like a very
sweet law-abiding citizen

01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:16.100
who Henry tries to corrupt
at every chance he can get,

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:19.010
which is exactly what Simon did to me.

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:21.460
Really was a bad influence.

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:27.044
Hey, Joan, do you remember
a guy called Gordon Mosley?

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.640
Gordo?

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:32.487
He was at high school
with you and Simon?

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.571
Yeah. Yeah, no, Gordo. He was...

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.482
He was the kid that got sent away.

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.689
He got sent away? Why?

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.082
Man, it was like a million years ago,

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:47.762
but they found him getting molested
in a car by this older kid.

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:52.041
It was really just...
It turned into a huge deal.

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.405
They pulled him out of school.

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:58.500
I guess he was getting bullied by the kids
for being gay, the poor thing.

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.568
So Simon would have
known all about it, right?

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:02.580
Simon was the one that reported it.

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:05.081
Simon and his friend Greg.

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.340
They were the ones that found him.

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.169
I think they essentially saved him,

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.340
you know, if he was in trouble.

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:12.680
Right.

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:16.260
You could ask him more about it.
I was 12. No one told me anything.

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:21.127
But, man, it was a big storm in,
like, a small town, you know?

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:44.641
Robyn?

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:48.960
Hi.

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:55.486
- How'd it go?
- Good.

01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:58.380
Good.

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:00.244
My mom get off okay?

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:02.481
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.491
Great.

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:12.140
You hungry?

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:14.163
Sure. I'll be in in a minute.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.164
"Danny McDonald."

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.980
"Mr. Callem, here's all the information
available on Gordon Mosley.

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.923
"Put your mind at ease.
This guy is a nobody."

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:39.404
He has a full file on him.
A background check.

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:43.921
"2005, breaking and entering
De Factos' residence.

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.765
"Attempted abduction of a minor.

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:51.980
"Discharged from the United States
Military, August 14, 2004."

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:53.500
"Conduct unbecoming.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.460
"Court forced stay in a rehab facility."

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.289
Yeah, but Lucy, why was Simon running

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:59.169
a background check without telling me?

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:04.240
Robyn, why don't you just ask him?

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:13.009
Okay, so you can't talk to your husband.

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:16.340
What are you going to do?

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:17.860
I want to find this Greg guy.

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.850
Simon's sister said
he was involved somehow.

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:22.725
Right.

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.762
Well, maybe you should do
some checking of your own.

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:29.290
Greg Pierson.

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:51.324
Mrs. Callem?

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:53.124
- Yes.
- Ah.

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:55.610
Right this way.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.002
Okay. Just relax.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.002
Uh, I'm sorry.

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:15.569
I think that you know
my husband, Simon Callem.

01:08:16.439 --> 01:08:17.600
Yeah.

01:08:19.479 --> 01:08:23.689
I came here today 'cause I need
to talk to you about a Gordon Mosley.

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:34.700
"Simon, just after all these years,

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:36.540
"I really was willing
to let bygones be bygones.

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:38.779
"I had nothing but good intentions."

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:41.779
And then there are these.
It's from the Bible.

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:45.700
"Behold he who conceives mischief
and brings forth falsehood.

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:48.451
"He has dug a pit and hollowed it out,

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:51.939
"and has fallen into
the hole which he made."

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:53.201
I...

01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:55.250
Look, I think he wants to hurt us

01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:58.051
for something that happened back then,

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:01.285
and I'm just trying to
find out what it was.

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:04.362
Simon's sister told me that you and him

01:09:04.479 --> 01:09:06.620
stopped Gordo from being molested.

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.131
If you were helping him,

01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:09.660
why would he want to hurt us?

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:11.300
He wasn't being molested.

01:09:11.399 --> 01:09:12.460
God, this is crazy.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:14.140
What do you mean,
he wasn't being molested?

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.819
She told me that he was found
in a car with a...

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:19.580
I'm sorry, you're just going to have
to talk to your husband about all this.

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:21.091
I have tried.

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:22.765
Please.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.483
Look, can you answer me one question?

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:33.801
The other person in the car
with Gordo, was it Simon?

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:35.761
What?

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:37.926
No, it's...

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:40.366
No.

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:43.060
Look, I've made peace with this.

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:46.700
With Gordo, with what happened
to him, what we did.

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:49.246
Wait, what you did? But then
you admit that something happened?

01:09:49.359 --> 01:09:52.921
- With what you did.
- No, it was nothing. I mean, he...

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:55.060
Look, it was nothing,
and then it kind of became something.

01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.730
I'm sorry, but you're not
making very much sense.

01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:59.611
- I'm just asking you to tell me...
- It was all a lie.

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.121
What was a lie?

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.366
The whole thing.

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.487
The whole story.
Not one part of it was true.

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.287
Simon made the whole thing up

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:13.731
about Gordo being with a guy in a car.

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.809
About him being gay.

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.487
But why? Why would he do that?

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:25.649
'Cause he could.

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.404
Simon was a bully.

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:31.700
He had a real mean streak,
and Gordo was a target.

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.609
One of the weak kids.

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:38.650
He made this whole thing up,
and it basically ruined Gordo's life.

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:43.969
I mean, it's amazing
how an idea can take a hold

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:47.207
and really bring a person down.

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:51.322
Look, we were just kids.

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:54.740
We didn't realize how crazy
this whole thing would get,

01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:57.060
but we did have a chance to stop it.

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:59.686
Simon could have told the truth,
but he didn't.

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:04.361
I mean, the bullying,
the kids beating on him,

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:09.571
and stuff like... I mean,
what happened with Gordo and his dad.

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:14.365
I don't know what that does to a person.

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:20.691
What happened with Gordo and his dad?

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.765
We've really got a process going.

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.220
They shouldn't get
the impression that I'm...

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:35.340
Hey, Robyn.

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:36.620
...and let them think that I'm...

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:37.721
Hey, honey.

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:40.460
You know, I'm passionate
about the job and...

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:41.721
Yes, I already did that for you.

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.780
The decision's coming down
Monday, all right?

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:46.201
I've already given my recommendations

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:48.940
and I don't think you have anything
to worry about, to be honest with you.

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.140
Didn't you mention
that there was another guy?

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.780
A Danny someone?

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:54.580
Danny McDonald. Did you hear?

01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:56.523
Yes, no, something went down, man.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.580
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. The guy's being investigated.

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:02.100
Listen, it's late. Why don't we
pick this up first thing in the morning?

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:04.820
- I've kept you here long enough.
- Oh, yeah.

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.460
Absolutely. It is late.

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.820
I gotta get out. Robyn, I'm leaving.
Your husband's kicking me out.

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:09.980
Hey, want to hit balls tomorrow?

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.411
- Yep.
- Yeah?

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:15.860
You scurry around behind my fucking back

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:18.980
and you dig up some idiot from my past?

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:20.620
Just talk to me about it.

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.140
I'm not talking to you about shit

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:23.287
because it's garbage.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:25.900
- Admit that you told a story...
- Stop talking.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.980
- ...that nearly got someone killed!
- Stop.

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:30.605
His father tried to kill him.

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:32.260
Stop! Stop!

01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:34.220
- He tried to burn him.
- Forget it.

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:38.260
Simon, what you said
affected people's lives.

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:40.966
His father was arrested
for attempted murder.

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.340
No, his dad knocked him around a little,

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:45.340
and now it's 25 years later

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:49.001
and the story's been blown
out of proportion. That's all.

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:50.806
So you do know.

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:54.180
Holy shit. I'm an asshole, Robyn, okay?

01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:57.100
I made his life a living hell
and I treated him like shit.

01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:00.220
Is that what you're trying to figure out?
That I was an asshole?

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.926
I was an asshole, okay?

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:06.940
My dad was an asshole to me,
treated me like shit.

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:09.060
But I took it. I sucked it up.

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:13.020
I'm not on my hands and knees
crying about it, praying about it.

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.646
Stuck in the fucking past about it.

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:20.540
I moved on. I made something of my life.

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:23.140
This world's about
fucking winners and losers,

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:25.811
and we're all in the same
shitty playground, you know?

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:29.720
Guess what? That this guy lost
and then he's moaning about it,

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:33.300
is just him being stuck
because he wants to be stuck

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:36.324
because he can't get
past the fucking moment.

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:40.900
He's not going to pull me back and apologize
for something I don't know about,

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.288
that I'm not responsible for,
that I don't care about.

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:46.330
I don't owe that guy shit.

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:48.420
You could say you're
sorry for your part of it.

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:52.060
Fuck that. People don't apologize
to everyone all the time, Robyn.

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:53.980
That's not the way the world works.

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:56.660
Or is that the way it works for you?
Is that what this is about?

01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:00.660
You fantasize about all those girls back
at high school that treated you like shit

01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:02.260
just lining up all of a sudden saying,

01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:05.682
"Hey, Robyn, we're so sorry
about how we treated you..."

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:07.006
That's great.

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:09.645
You're a bully.

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:12.969
You were then, and you still are now.

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:19.009
I'll take an apology for that.

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:20.780
Oh, geez, this is not about an apology!

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.723
Simon, this is about you and me!

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:26.731
You have to do this for us, because if
you don't at least try to fix this...

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.564
If you don't...

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:33.980
Even if I wanted to,
I have no idea where to find this guy.

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:35.491
So save it.

01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:45.209
Oh, yes, you do.
You seem to know a lot of things.

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:22.460
Those Post-its were
stuck to my car window

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.369
soon after he sent that letter,

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:29.161
and they are the reason that I had
that background check done.

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:32.888
And then had an attorney contact him

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:36.170
and get a restraining order.

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.500
I'm sorry. I was trying to protect you.

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:42.490
I wanted this to be
my burden, not yours.

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:48.365
I had no idea to what extent
his father hurt him.

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:51.020
I'd heard stories,
but I did not know to what extent.

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:53.700
Funny, when someone lies to you enough,

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:56.929
you just stop
believing anything they say.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.482
'Cause all this time,
I thought that I was crazy,

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:05.771
and I'm not.

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:09.010
And you let me.

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:14.324
And I just realized

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:18.083
I have no idea who you really are.

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:33.566
What can I do to make it up to you?

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:38.127
You're asking the wrong person.

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:52.660
Our final question
is a bonus round question.

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:57.460
Which album was famously
introduced as testimony

01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:01.420
in the Tate-LaBianca homicide cases,

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:05.684
Los Angeles, in 1969?

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:11.726
Also referred to as the "what" murders?
The "what" murders?

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:22.445
Hey.

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:24.880
Gordo.

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:28.441
Simon.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.085
How you doing?

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:33.848
Long time. I saw you up there.
Wanted to say hello.

01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:38.403
Actually, I tracked you down, okay?

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:45.084
I wanted to apologize.

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:53.089
Robyn and I were talking about things
that happened back at school.

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:56.610
About how I might not
have treated you so well,

01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:01.286
and she wanted me to bury the hatchet.

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:05.448
Or as you said, let bygones be bygones.

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:07.441
And so...

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:11.049
So she wanted you to come.

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:15.128
No. Listen.

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:21.490
I wouldn't be here if I
didn't want to be here.

01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:26.723
So I'm here, and I'm apologizing to you.

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:31.603
- Well?
- Well, what?

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:34.043
You accept my apology?

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:38.203
You see, it's too late for that.

01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:40.811
Got it. Okay.

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.080
You know, I was willing.

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.420
Were you, though?

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.580
Yeah. What the fuck
do you think I'm doing here?

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:49.365
See, you're done with the past,

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.082
but the past is not done with you.

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.525
What? What do you mean by that?

01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:55.980
It's a saying.

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:59.060
I know it's a saying,
but what do you mean?

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:00.400
Hey, I asked you a question.

01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:07.001
Hey!

01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:08.167
I gave you a chance.

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:10.321
I asked you a question.

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:12.121
Huh?

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:14.721
Hey, answer the question.

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:23.003
Accept my apology.

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:25.003
I said it's too late for that.

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:32.524
It's too late for you, Gordo.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.365
Look at you.

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:36.565
Now I want you to listen to me.

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:38.100
I want you to understand something.

01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:39.740
Leave it. Leave it.

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:41.980
Listen to me. Listen to me.

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:43.420
Who you are is your own fault.

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:45.648
It's got nothing to do with me.

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:49.060
Okay? If you ever come near
me or my family again,

01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:51.140
I will destroy you, you understand?

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:24.331
How'd it go?

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:31.087
I found him, and...

01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:44.764
What did he say?

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.126
He...

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:52.284
He just seemed so
appreciative, you know?

01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:56.005
And...

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.445
I'm so sorry.

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:15.564
I'm really sorry.

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:20.322
But it's definitely over.

01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:25.051
Thank God.

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:27.564
I'm so sorry, honey.

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:34.042
For everything, you know.

01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:41.209
Yeah. Me too.

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:50.651
Speech!

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:52.100
Who I would like to say
is my successor...

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:53.645
- Stand up. Stand up.
- Speech.

01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:55.524
- Speech, Simon. Come on.
- A man who's synonymous

01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:58.604
with hard work, with integrity,

01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:00.890
with just being a kiss-ass,

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.369
but nobody that I can honestly think
of better to fill this position

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:09.445
and a man I'm very proud to call
a great man and a good friend.

01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:14.820
- Orthus' new National Divisions Sales Rep.
- It's all because of you.

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:17.082
Speech. Speech.

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:18.860
All credit goes to Kevin.

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:21.260
Truly, without you
it would not have happened.

01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:23.886
Thank you. Do you hear?
He said, "All credit goes to Kevin."

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.420
And just, you know,

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:29.820
I'm happy and I love you and I love him

01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:31.580
and love you guys...

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:32.780
Better speech.

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:33.881
Oh!

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:39.100
What the hell was that?

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:41.020
- Was that a branch? Are you okay?
- It was big.

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:43.521
Somebody does not want
you to give a speech.

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:47.083
You just jumped. You jumped so far.

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:49.204
- I don't know what that was.
- What was that?

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:51.780
- Was that the glass?
- Careful.

01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:53.041
What the hell?

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:54.366
Turn the light on.

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:03.780
- Did it get you?
- No. No.

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:05.484
- You okay?
- You okay? Call the police.

01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:07.660
- I think that was a rock.
- Holy...

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:09.020
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:10.620
- You guys all right? Hey.
- Is everybody okay?

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:11.721
Hey.

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:16.245
Call the police.

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:22.100
Guys...

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:25.605
Okay, careful.

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:29.220
Turn that off.

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:31.129
It's gone, whatever it was.

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:33.605
You have to file a report.

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:36.731
What was it?

01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:48.700
Guys, stay back.
No, guys, stay back, stay back.

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:49.961
Simon!

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:52.260
Simon! My God!

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:53.420
- Stay back!
- Simon!

01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:55.020
- Be careful! Watch out, watch out!
- Stay back.

01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:56.220
- Watch out.
- Guys, stay back, seriously.

01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:57.446
No.

01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:00.729
Jesus! My God.

01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:04.808
- Who the fuck are you?
- Jesus, Danny, what the hell?

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:06.963
Who the fuck is this guy?

01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:08.740
- Get off!
- Do you know this guy?

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:09.860
Yeah, it's Danny McDonald!

01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:11.860
- Fuck off.
- Guys, guys. I know him.

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:13.450
- It's Danny McDonald.
- Fuck off!

01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:15.963
Let him go. Come on.

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:19.900
You're the one
who cheated me out of the job,

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.740
I fucking know it was you, mother...

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:22.860
Hey, hey, hey.

01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:24.769
Get off me, get off me!

01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:26.371
Hey, hey, hey.

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:28.740
I saw the e-mail, you asshole!

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.940
Saying you knew people
at my old firm, yeah?

01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:34.500
Who the fuck did you know
at Parker and Fitch?

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:36.140
You fabricated all that shit, admit it!

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:39.300
I lost my job because of
you, you lying asshole!

01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:41.402
Who the fuck did you know?

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.206
No, no.

01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:48.890
- Oh, fuck.
- Hey.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.923
No, no, no.

01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:53.406
Please, come on.

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:55.001
No, no, I can't get arrested, please.

01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:56.300
It's okay.

01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:57.686
No. No.

01:24:58.400 --> 01:24:59.606
Let him go.

01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:03.603
Go ahead, let him go. Let him go.

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:07.011
Go ahead.

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:22.648
I think this is happening.

01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:25.260
Okay. All right, let's go.

01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:27.100
- This is happening.
- Simon?

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:28.725
- It's happening.
- Get your keys.

01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:30.444
- Is anyone blocking you in?
- Let's go get your bag, okay?

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:31.607
- Okay.
- You all right?

01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:33.245
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:08.740
Hey, Kevin, how are you?

01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:11.286
Simon, we need to talk. You free?

01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:15.520
Yeah. I've got a second, what's up?

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.220
I was doing him a favor.
This guy had a bad track record.

01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:22.140
Look, Simon, it kills me to be calling you
today of all days, but...

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:23.620
- Kevin, listen to me.
- ...I just had to warn you.

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:26.820
They know the stuff
about Danny was fabricated.

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:29.900
They want your office
cleaned out by the end of the week.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.740
Jesus, what a fucking mess.

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:33.780
You know, I went to bat for you.

01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:35.580
Buddy, I gotta call you back.
I hope you understand.

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:36.900
We're going to work
this out later, okay?

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.890
Save your breath, all right?
This is final.

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.129
I'll call you later.

01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:47.260
With what they're giving me? Sure.

01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:50.580
No problem.
I'm surprised you're still talking now.

01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:53.206
You should go home and get some sleep.

01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:59.140
I'm going to go get you that tea, okay?

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:01.561
Okay. Thank you, Lucy.

01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:15.569
They're nice people, aren't they?
Lucy and Ron?

01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:18.100
Reminds me, I should
probably go check on Ron.

01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:20.500
See how he's doing with the window.

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:23.524
Maybe take a shower for the both of us.

01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:28.540
See if Ron's open to taking care
of Jangles for a couple of days.

01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:30.563
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:35.570
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:39.561
Call me if you need anything else.

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:41.980
Simon?

01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:43.161
Hmm?

01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:54.369
I don't... I don't want to go
back to that house.

01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:58.642
God, this isn't easy, Simon.

01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:00.530
Especially now.

01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:03.601
I...

01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:11.523
I don't want to go back
to that house with you.

01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:20.766
You...

01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:28.491
Okay.

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:32.444
I'm going to hurry back and we'll talk.

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:36.529
I'll be right back.

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:22.660
I'll tell you why he
doesn't have a wife.

01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:25.180
He'd like to be married to you.
He'd like you to be his wife.

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:26.964
- Oh, God, Simon.
- Yep.

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:30.260
Come on, honey. This guy likes you
so much. Tell me you don't see it.

01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:31.420
Come on.

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:33.249
I really don't think
that is the reason why.

01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:35.060
- Stop.
- Come on, honey.

01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:39.802
Why all the drop in's and the stop
by's only when you're home alone?

01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:43.540
I think he's obsessed with you, honey.
I think he wants to nail you.

01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:46.220
I think he wants to be me,
wants to move into the house.

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:48.740
He wants to play mommies
and daddies with you,

01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:50.330
the creepy little fucker.

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:52.761
I'm Gordo the Weirdo.

01:32:57.960 --> 01:32:59.371
What?

01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:07.168
...crazy little pee-pee,

01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:11.046
pee-pee pleasey-weasy.

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:14.209
I'm Gordo the Weirdo
and I want you all to myself.

01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:15.460
- Can I have you?
- No.

01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:16.900
Can I have you, please? Why not?

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.540
- Why not?
- Because you're disgusting.

01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:37.646
I came to say...

01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:53.245
Congratulations.

01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:34.923
What happened to you?

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:38.280
Uh...

01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:40.922
Did Simon do that to you?

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:43.603
He just...

01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:48.371
I don't know what's going on with him.

01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:50.289
He just went crazy.

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:03.404
Boy or a girl?

01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:16.050
He's a boy.

01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:30.328
I'm very happy for you.

01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:52.403
Good people deserve good things.

01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:55.403
No. Fuck.

01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:58.404
What did you do?

01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:16.040
Come on, Robyn, pick up the phone.

01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:18.445
Hi, you've reached Robyn.

01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:19.607
I can't get to the phone right now.

01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:21.609
- Please leave a message.
- Shit.

01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:47.688
Robyn?

01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:05.802
Hey! Gordon!

01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:07.446
Hey!

01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:10.900
Hey! Gordon!

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.889
You sick motherfucker!

01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:44.161
Gordo!

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:55.940
Hello?

01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:00.260
Fuck you. Where are you?

01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:01.580
Don't interrupt me.

01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:04.260
If you don't mind,
I'm just going to power through this

01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:06.840
and you can talk right after, okay?

01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:11.500
Are you going to tell her, or should I?

01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:13.540
No, no, no. Please. Please. Please.

01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:15.100
- Gordo, listen.
- Please?

01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:16.420
Please?

01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:19.649
Pleasey-weasy, pleasey-weasy,
creepy little fucker.

01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:25.047
Say "pleasey-weasy."
Yeah, "pleasey-weasy." Say it.

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:28.260
Yeah, you're sweating now.
You know what?

01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:29.820
You know what you really want is,

01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:32.140
what you really want is for me
to tell you that everything's okay.

01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:34.129
That it didn't happen.

01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:38.041
Does it remind you of something?

01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:41.003
You never did that for me.

01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:43.124
Fucking asshole.

01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:45.780
Okay?

01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:48.406
I didn't do it. There.

01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:51.204
I didn't touch her.

01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:54.924
Or maybe I did.

01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:57.980
I don't know.
See, I could tell you the truth.

01:39:58.080 --> 01:39:59.740
Maybe I didn't do it,

01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:02.366
but a liar won't believe
anybody else, right?

01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:06.641
I think you just need to go
and have a look at the baby.

01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:10.767
It's all in the eyes, you see.

01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:13.780
You see what happens when you poison

01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:16.565
other people's minds with ideas?
