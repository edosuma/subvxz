21:20.880 --> 21:22.749
- Yes, here we go.

21:22.782 --> 21:23.950
- Yeah,
it's called "Dirty Durbs."

21:23.983 --> 21:26.486
[together] Awesome. Oh, my God.
I like it. "Dirty Durbs."

21:26.519 --> 21:27.754
- Yeah, and--
and the way it works is,

21:27.787 --> 21:30.757
based on the level of ecstasy
or pain that you're perceiving

21:30.790 --> 21:32.659
in his face,
you have to determine

21:32.692 --> 21:34.961
whether he's peeing, pooping,
or masturbating.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.429
[together]
Ohh. Oh, my God.

21:36.463 --> 21:37.497
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
and the thing is--

21:37.530 --> 21:38.732
yeah, yeah, yeah, it's great.

21:38.765 --> 21:43.570
All right, everybody shut your
precious, beautiful mouths.

21:43.603 --> 21:45.939
You know, after spending
an entire week alone

21:45.972 --> 21:48.942
in this empty school,

21:48.975 --> 21:52.912
I realized that I can't survive
without community.

21:52.946 --> 21:55.515
And I came to appreciate
all of you.

21:59.786 --> 22:03.690
And I decided
that I wanted each of you

22:03.723 --> 22:06.926
to finish this year
knowing more biology

22:06.960 --> 22:08.728
than any student ever has.

22:08.762 --> 22:12.565
- Mr. Griffin, I know we've had
our differences in the past.

22:12.599 --> 22:14.734
- Uh, yeah, hold that thought,
Sarika,

22:14.768 --> 22:16.770
because the biggest thing
that I learned is that

22:16.803 --> 22:19.472
prolonged exposure
to rodent-killing gas

22:19.506 --> 22:23.443
causes hallucinations
and irrational ideation.

22:23.476 --> 22:25.945
And all these things
that I thought I'd learned,

22:25.979 --> 22:28.648
well...

22:28.682 --> 22:31.751
chemically induced illusions

22:31.785 --> 22:33.486

22:35.488 --> 22:38.558
But now...

22:38.591 --> 22:41.027
I've got my thinker back
in the pink.

22:41.061 --> 22:43.897
And everything's back
to normal.
