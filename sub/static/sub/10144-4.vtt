<i>Previously on Strike Back...</i>

00:01.461 --> 00:04.580
They've identified Craig Hanson
as the man who murdered your wife.

00:04.615 --> 00:06.015
When I heard,
I wanted to kill him.

00:06.050 --> 00:09.330
Stonebridge has requested
reassignment to this unit.

00:09.365 --> 00:11.125
- And you approved that?
- We need the best.

00:11.160 --> 00:13.570
- Christy Bryant. - I should see that
they're fully briefed on you.

00:13.580 --> 00:15.150
- They know.
- Everything?

00:15.185 --> 00:17.020
What is it that you
really want?

00:18.310 --> 00:20.795
El Soldat is a man that
could get us the triggers.

00:20.830 --> 00:23.650
- The terrorist?
- I thought you dealt with anyone.

00:23.685 --> 00:26.435
The man that you know as
Othmani is El Soldat's brother.

00:26.470 --> 00:29.010
- Two trucks heading your way.
- El Soldat's men.

00:29.015 --> 00:30.580
- We got to move.
- What about the triggers?

00:30.600 --> 00:32.110
We got to go.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.020
RPG!

00:51.960 --> 00:55.880
- Zero, you got a position on El Soldat's men?
- They're still at the bus.

00:55.890 --> 00:59.080
Bravo, as soon as they have the triggers,
they'll be headed your way.

00:59.640 --> 01:02.330
- How's he doing?
- He's lost a lot of blood.

01:02.480 --> 01:06.060
There's a French monk, helps out
the locals. One kilometer from here.

01:06.070 --> 01:09.270
- Maybe he has IV fluids.
- I don't give a shit. We're not stopping.

01:09.410 --> 01:12.820
- Then he will die. - We keep him alive,
we have something to bargain with.

01:13.670 --> 01:15.980
The Hoggar, Algeria

01:31.760 --> 01:34.030
This place
is a fucking death trap.

01:34.180 --> 01:35.420
Yeah, I know.

01:35.560 --> 01:38.760
Get what we need to keep
Othmani alive, and we're out of here.

01:41.750 --> 01:43.380
- Scott.
- Coming to you.

01:56.320 --> 01:59.210
We have a wounded man, and
we could use some help, please.

02:00.350 --> 02:01.900
Screw you asshole!

02:01.910 --> 02:03.860
Sir, we got a guy
dying here,

02:03.890 --> 02:07.520
so we'd really appreciate
a little Christian charity.

02:07.560 --> 02:08.910
Understand?

02:14.060 --> 02:15.380
Thank you.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.350
Come on.

02:19.330 --> 02:20.920
Fix him up.

02:22.190 --> 02:23.490
Thank you.

02:24.320 --> 02:25.740
Give me that.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.220
Here, here.

02:33.280 --> 02:36.050
- Make it quick, huh?
- It's all clear out back.

02:38.800 --> 02:40.550
You got IV?

02:41.190 --> 02:44.320
If he's not sewn up
properly, nothing will help.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.490
You got 5 minutes.

02:47.420 --> 02:49.030
Money?

02:50.390 --> 02:51.800
Are you fucking
kidding me?

02:51.860 --> 02:54.130
If you don't help,
he's going to die.

02:55.120 --> 02:57.730
Here. How much
do you want? Fuck.

02:59.660 --> 03:01.440
It's going to take
at least--

03:01.475 --> 03:03.220
Yeah. You got
5 minutes, buddy.

03:11.620 --> 03:13.830
Locals have a lot
of trauma wounds?

03:15.120 --> 03:18.690
Out here, men get very
possessive with the goats.

03:20.420 --> 03:22.210
Take your
fucking time.

03:32.360 --> 03:35.270
You seen a white bunny with
a pocket watch recently?

03:37.190 --> 03:39.630
I'm beginning to think you fell
down the rabbit hole, bud.

03:39.790 --> 03:42.360
- I'm here.
- You better be.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.075
What's taking them
so long?

03:45.080 --> 03:49.250
<i>Bravo, El Soldat and his men are on
their way. You've got a minute, two at most.</i>

03:49.260 --> 03:51.650
Fuck. All right. Hey, people.
Let's go.

03:51.660 --> 03:52.930
We're moving out
right now.

03:52.950 --> 03:56.560
- You see that white bunny,
you let me know. - I will.

03:57.590 --> 03:59.560
You stay on us.
Let's move.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.990
Let's move.
Let's move.

04:16.360 --> 04:17.750
Pick him up!

04:17.755 --> 04:19.959
Get him back!
Get him back in the house now!

04:20.790 --> 04:21.680
Shit!

You cover from there!

06:47.380 --> 06:48.820
Grenade!

06:49.780 --> 06:50.990
Fuck.

06:55.520 --> 06:56.800
Fuck!

06:57.290 --> 06:58.520
Go!

07:20.060 --> 07:21.300
Fuck!

07:27.200 --> 07:28.470
Fuck!

07:34.790 --> 07:36.290
Going back.

07:38.140 --> 07:39.480
Back up!

07:44.270 --> 07:46.420
Fuck. Move!

07:52.420 --> 07:54.080
Fuck.

07:57.590 --> 07:59.205
Not gonna try that
anytime soon.

07:59.240 --> 08:02.210
- Yeah, at least
not in the daylight. - Yeah.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.640
- Sorry about your truck.
- So, what happens now?

08:07.660 --> 08:09.490
You ever heard
of the Alamo?

08:12.180 --> 08:14.955
How long have you known
that Othmani is El Soldat's brother?

08:14.990 --> 08:18.950
Half-brother. For sure?
Not until I saw his face.

08:19.120 --> 08:21.365
Would it have made any
difference before now?

08:21.400 --> 08:24.540
You're not a spook anymore.
You're the leader of this team.

08:24.550 --> 08:28.660
We share what we know because out there,
knowledge isn't power.

08:29.260 --> 08:31.110
It's what keeps us alive.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.870
You think they want
to surrender?

08:47.520 --> 08:48.760
Mike.
Hmm?

08:49.420 --> 08:50.945
White flag out there.

08:50.980 --> 08:53.720
- Do you believe it?
- Well, don't know.

08:53.755 --> 08:55.520
There's only one
way to find out.

08:56.090 --> 08:58.310
- I'll go. - I'm better
with people.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.410
Yeah.

08:59.990 --> 09:03.160
- Fuck off. - That's exactly what
I'm talking about.

09:08.120 --> 09:09.960
<i>Zero,
I have visual.</i>

09:11.050 --> 09:13.050
It's El Soldat in person.

09:15.770 --> 09:17.480
I never got close.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.440
Your people
are excited, huh?

09:28.660 --> 09:30.280
I don't
get out much.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.840
Anyone tell you
you got a great profile?

09:36.140 --> 09:37.370
Once.

09:39.720 --> 09:43.250
- Bravo One, make sure
you have a clear shot. - Copy that.

09:43.260 --> 09:47.100
When Bravo Two signals he's
clear, and on my command,

09:48.560 --> 09:49.670
take it.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.760
We have your brother.

09:53.890 --> 09:58.490
We only share a mother, but she would be most disappointed if I did not bring him home,

09:58.500 --> 10:01.000
so give him back
to me, and you may leave.

10:01.720 --> 10:06.770
You release the triggers, let us go,
and I'll let you have your family reunion.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.940
I have made
my offer.

10:20.650 --> 10:21.965
Oh, fuck.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.715
<i>Bravo Two,
you're marked.</i>

10:23.750 --> 10:25.430
<i>About your
2 o'clock.</i>

10:25.590 --> 10:29.430
Zero, if I take
this hit, Bravo Two is dead.

10:37.600 --> 10:41.600
Zero, Bravo Two is signaling to take
the shot anyway.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.310
Major.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.560
Bravo Two, disengage.

11:00.390 --> 11:02.440
One soldier
for El Soldat.

11:04.550 --> 11:06.430
Yes, I thought
about it, Major.

11:08.940 --> 11:10.880
Are you sure you
won't change your mind?

11:11.140 --> 11:14.100
Because as you see, I
have many men and RPGs.

11:14.430 --> 11:18.650
Yeah, but you'll never use them
unless you want to barbecue your brother.

11:19.320 --> 11:22.850
You have limited ammunition
and a perimeter you cannot defend.

11:24.030 --> 11:25.910
And there is one thing
else you should know:

11:26.090 --> 11:29.330
My men--they are not
as educated as I am.

11:29.820 --> 11:32.890
Last month, they cut off the cocks
of an Algerian army patrol

11:33.120 --> 11:37.300
and put them in their
mouth just like this, for fun.

11:40.790 --> 11:42.120
We're done here.

11:47.760 --> 11:49.840
Stupid
as well as naive.

11:50.490 --> 11:52.440
You must be an
excellent soldier.

11:52.760 --> 11:55.760
I hope you like my country,
because you will die here.

11:57.820 --> 12:00.270
So that whole "shoot
him anyway" stunt...

12:00.310 --> 12:02.189
If I'd have taken
that shot, you'd be dead,
buddy.

12:02.190 --> 12:04.300
Yeah, well, I knew
you wouldn't take it.

12:04.310 --> 12:05.810
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

12:05.811 --> 12:07.230
Bullshit.

12:08.820 --> 12:11.485
- So, what did he have to say?
- The usual bad-guy bollocks.

12:11.490 --> 12:13.857
- Yeah.
- Oh, and he said something about

12:13.857 --> 12:16.453
-  cutting off our cocks and putting them
in our mouths. - Awesome.

12:17.080 --> 12:19.760
- I've been thinking
of a new look. - Ha. Try shaving.

12:19.870 --> 12:23.490
All right, so we move out
of here as soon as it's dark.

12:23.525 --> 12:25.330
- That's a plan.
- Good.

12:31.790 --> 12:32.990
Thanks.

12:44.230 --> 12:45.820
You got a spare
one of those?

12:51.270 --> 12:52.500
Thank you.

12:54.550 --> 12:56.330
You are their prisoner also?

13:01.950 --> 13:03.740
Then you are their friend

13:04.510 --> 13:06.560
You needed medical attention

13:08.100 --> 13:09.680
So just a doctor?

13:11.790 --> 13:13.840
They told you
I'm a terrorist.

13:15.660 --> 13:17.270
You're not?

13:18.080 --> 13:19.610
I'm a soldier.

13:21.560 --> 13:26.020
This is a war, and sooner or later, you're
going to have to choose: Us or them.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.960
What's to choose?

13:30.690 --> 13:34.270
And you--why do you
help these people?

13:34.690 --> 13:36.250
It suits me.

13:36.620 --> 13:41.140
They come here. They take what they
want, and they move on.

13:41.860 --> 13:43.950
They don't give
a shit about us.

13:44.950 --> 13:46.620
That's a little
harsh.

13:47.190 --> 13:48.820
And now it's "us"?

13:49.220 --> 13:51.530
At least they do
move on, Arab.

13:51.720 --> 13:56.180
Over a thousand years, and we're
still waiting for you to leave.

14:02.720 --> 14:04.870
We're leaving
as soon as it gets dark.

14:05.060 --> 14:06.380
Tell your guys.

14:07.990 --> 14:10.010
You're coming, too,
princess.

14:16.160 --> 14:17.175
Let's move.

14:17.210 --> 14:18.240
Yeah. Let's go!

14:18.340 --> 14:21.150
Let's go. Pick him up.
Make sure he doesn't bleed out.

14:21.720 --> 14:23.330
And you, also.
Let's go.

14:25.360 --> 14:29.540
We can't leave you behind. El Soldat will come down hard on anyone who has helped us.

14:31.160 --> 14:32.680
This is my home.

14:32.810 --> 14:35.125
Zero, how are
we looking out there?

14:35.160 --> 14:37.250
<i>Bravo,
you're clear. Good luck.</i>

14:37.260 --> 14:40.270
Stay tight. Thanks. Gonna
need some of that.

15:06.900 --> 15:08.270
Go.

15:08.370 --> 15:09.870
That's it. Let's move.

15:10.390 --> 15:12.430
Come on. Come on.
Let's go. Move.

15:12.540 --> 15:13.550
Come on. Come on.

15:19.980 --> 15:21.690
Across there.
Go. Go, go.

15:23.750 --> 15:25.095
Fuck!

15:25.130 --> 15:26.440
Come here. Come here.

15:27.970 --> 15:28.705
Fuck.

15:28.740 --> 15:31.050
Get in back! Move!
Get in back!

15:31.560 --> 15:34.200
- What have you got?
Can you see anything? - No, nothing.

15:34.210 --> 15:36.550
- You got a phosphorus
grenade? - Yeah.

15:36.660 --> 15:38.320
Give me it.
Hup.

15:39.490 --> 15:40.720
Fuck.

15:40.760 --> 15:43.490
When this goes off,
you run back there.

15:47.940 --> 15:49.270
Go!

15:50.920 --> 15:52.520
Move, move, move,
move, move!

15:52.580 --> 15:53.920
Go on.

15:57.120 --> 15:59.960
They're not gonna try
leaving again anytime soon.

16:00.920 --> 16:04.430
Right. We sit tight,
see how it plays.

16:08.040 --> 16:11.030
Zero, we can't move.

16:11.130 --> 16:14.660
<i>We got a sniper up on
that raised ground, southwest.</i>

16:14.695 --> 16:16.220
<i>Can you have a look
for me?</i>

16:16.360 --> 16:19.570
- Bravo, I've got nothing. - Must be
masking their heat signature.

16:20.920 --> 16:22.480
Old Taliban trick.

16:39.020 --> 16:40.780
Guess what I'm
thinking right now.

16:40.815 --> 16:42.670
A mule could guess.

16:46.690 --> 16:48.030
I'm thinking...

16:48.860 --> 16:51.170
that my last
human contact

16:51.320 --> 16:56.850
is potentially gonna be with some sweaty
little bearded terrorist who wants to kill me

16:56.890 --> 17:01.740
just so he can cut off my cock
and stick it in my own mouth.

17:01.750 --> 17:05.400
- It might be
safer there. - Maybe.

17:10.859 --> 17:13.530
El Soldat's men could
come at any time.

17:14.030 --> 17:15.170
Yeah.

17:28.520 --> 17:29.970
Well?

18:14.620 --> 18:16.910
- Quickly.
- Yes, ma'am.

18:22.820 --> 18:24.550
We should attack now.

18:27.830 --> 18:30.330
How much did it cost you
to teach you to use that gun?

18:30.470 --> 18:32.300
The price of the bullets?

18:32.590 --> 18:36.320
Over 6 million dollars was spent
training those soldiers

18:36.730 --> 18:40.070
They are not men they are weapons

18:40.660 --> 18:42.010
we wait

18:43.430 --> 18:45.710
for the rest of our people.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.170
We have till morning.

18:51.100 --> 18:52.150
Go!

18:59.070 --> 19:00.650
My little fool.

19:01.010 --> 19:03.050
This may be one mess.

19:04.140 --> 19:06.290
I can't get you out of alive.

19:11.790 --> 19:12.990
Ma'am?

19:13.090 --> 19:17.130
You asked me to look into who was
on the CIA flight shot down over Mali.

19:17.165 --> 19:21.170
There was a prisoner--Faris Rafik,
El Soldat's right-hand man.

19:21.180 --> 19:24.300
But a closer friend
to the man that you know as Othmani.

19:24.460 --> 19:26.390
They knew each other
as children.

19:29.130 --> 19:34.250
What is the exact nature of your
relationship with Othmani, Major?

19:35.790 --> 19:39.260
Have you been speaking
to Toby Oakes? What did he tell you?

19:39.690 --> 19:42.430
That you slept
with Othmani to get to El Soldat.

19:43.220 --> 19:48.200
SIS got impatient. They wanted him
snatched, but he'd gone.

19:48.560 --> 19:50.980
- Did he tell you that
I tipped him off? - Did you?

19:50.990 --> 19:52.890
What? Tip him off
or fuck him?

19:53.710 --> 19:56.290
Who you fuck in the line
of duty is your business,

19:56.790 --> 20:01.030
but if you warned him off and
he went on to bring down that plane over Mali,

20:01.080 --> 20:04.750
then you're carrying baggage
that could impact your leadership of this unit,

20:04.760 --> 20:07.900
and that...
is my business.

20:14.860 --> 20:15.930
Bravo,

20:16.900 --> 20:18.730
is the
prisoner conscious?

20:19.590 --> 20:21.090
That's affirmative.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.290
Put him on.

20:26.490 --> 20:27.800
Oy. It's for you.

20:45.420 --> 20:48.850
In English,
for my friends.

20:50.460 --> 20:52.560
I remember the taste
of your skin

20:53.860 --> 20:55.640
and the lies
you whispered.

20:57.020 --> 20:58.900
Perhaps they weren't
all lies.

21:01.730 --> 21:03.220
You are injured.

21:05.700 --> 21:08.610
Life is hard on those of
us who dare to dream.

21:11.820 --> 21:13.760
The triggers
were on the bus.

21:14.770 --> 21:16.750
El Soldat has them.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.440
You lost.

21:19.550 --> 21:23.590
You made the call from the compound
initiating the bombing on the CIA flight.

21:25.490 --> 21:26.730
Arrest me.

21:26.920 --> 21:29.080
Your friend Faris Rafik
was on that plane.

21:36.850 --> 21:40.560
When there is no enemy within,
the enemy outside cannot hurt you.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.260
He was a traitor?

21:43.990 --> 21:45.740
I am tired now.

21:54.420 --> 21:55.940
He's hiding something.

21:56.920 --> 21:58.500
Where are you going?

21:58.960 --> 22:03.480
If El Soldat's right-hand man was talking to
the Americans, then I want to know what he said.

22:03.780 --> 22:06.460
You did tip Othmani off
in Tangiers, didn't you?

22:07.780 --> 22:10.100
He guessed--
outplayed me.

22:11.350 --> 22:13.130
It won't happen
again.

22:16.490 --> 22:18.850
Be advised: Helios
is about to go blind.

22:18.900 --> 22:22.300
We lose sat coverage
at 0500.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.970
If they mobilize for an
attack, you let us know.

22:30.510 --> 22:33.070
Guess we're gonna be here
for the party after all.

22:34.670 --> 22:38.060
Look what I found--
fertilizer.

22:39.480 --> 22:43.110
There's a couple of cans of gas out the back,
so I figured we'd prep some shit,

22:43.140 --> 22:45.900
lay it as soon as we find out
which way they're gonna come at us.

22:45.935 --> 22:49.380
- What about our friends with the night sight?
- Yeah, I'm still working on that one.

22:50.690 --> 22:53.580
You can't actually
mean to fight them.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.690
You must surrender.

22:56.160 --> 23:00.740
Do what they say, exchange the
brother for your freedom.

23:00.775 --> 23:02.150
No way.

23:02.430 --> 23:04.600
We're dead as soon
as we hand him over.

23:06.730 --> 23:08.650
You take sugar
with your coffee, father?

23:11.290 --> 23:12.610
What?

23:13.160 --> 23:15.600
- You got fresh coffee.
- Yeah.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.260
Grind it yourself?

23:47.450 --> 23:49.670
You want to tell me
what happened on the bus?

23:54.950 --> 23:58.570
If you're gonna start that "Alice In Wonderland" bullshit, I don't want to have this conversation, yeah?

23:58.800 --> 24:00.000
I'm not.

24:03.090 --> 24:06.760
I lost it.

24:08.500 --> 24:10.810
You only came back
to 20 because...

24:11.020 --> 24:14.020
You thought it would be easier
to track down Hanson, huh?

24:16.160 --> 24:17.260
Yeah.

24:18.810 --> 24:22.590
Don't blame you. If I was you,
I'd probably do the same thing.

24:22.600 --> 24:23.940
But?

24:25.910 --> 24:30.910
That shit leads down a dark
and slippery path, Mike.

24:31.900 --> 24:34.700
What's at the end of it--
that ain't pretty.

24:36.610 --> 24:39.810
What we do,
our jobs--

24:40.610 --> 24:43.160
you let that shit
get personal, and...

24:44.300 --> 24:46.670
That's when you lose
yourself.

24:48.060 --> 24:49.400
Trust me.

24:50.740 --> 24:52.770
I did.

24:53.830 --> 24:57.130
And if it weren't
for 20, you guys--

24:58.010 --> 25:00.940
All I'm saying is don't go
getting lost on me, Mike.

25:03.640 --> 25:05.380
Roger that.

25:19.350 --> 25:21.280
The other woman
in Scott's life.

25:23.650 --> 25:26.919
Tell me what El Soldat's lieutenant
was doing on that CIA flight

25:26.919 --> 25:29.292
he had shot down over Mali.

25:29.760 --> 25:31.620
And in return
I get?

25:38.620 --> 25:43.610
Axmali was selling on nuclear triggers
that he picked up in Mogadishu.

25:45.430 --> 25:47.030
To El Soldat.

25:50.430 --> 25:52.530
Ok, let's talk.

26:06.600 --> 26:09.330
Go, get some rest.

26:19.230 --> 26:21.050
You've been avoiding me, father?

26:21.470 --> 26:22.900
I despise you.

26:25.970 --> 26:28.550
Aren't we both people of the book?

26:30.350 --> 26:31.980
What do you suggest?

26:32.740 --> 26:34.950
We hold hands and pray together?

26:35.640 --> 26:39.950
Help me father! As you've
helped my brother in the past.

26:54.530 --> 26:57.890
Mind if I turn on
the radio? I find it relaxing.

26:59.130 --> 27:00.240
That's fine.

27:12.210 --> 27:15.100
Zero, is there any movement
from El Soldat's men?

27:15.630 --> 27:16.720
<i>Negative.</i>

27:55.910 --> 27:57.950
The one who
killed your wife--

27:58.350 --> 27:59.710
is he dead?

28:07.100 --> 28:09.740
You--you don't
do subtle, do you?

28:10.790 --> 28:12.370
You will see it is done.

28:30.750 --> 28:33.340
My brother should never
have let you stay

28:36.890 --> 28:39.840
Your people are like mine.

28:40.900 --> 28:43.970
How many lives, how much gold
did it take to kill Bin Laden?

28:45.300 --> 28:49.100
It is what is right,
whatever the cost.

29:06.710 --> 29:08.750
What are you doing?
Stop!

29:09.230 --> 29:10.530
What are you doing?

29:12.400 --> 29:15.090
No! No!
Khafir!

29:15.160 --> 29:17.680
Oy! Oy, get off
of him! Move!

29:19.420 --> 29:21.110
Back against
the wall.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.530
Back against
the wall!

29:26.150 --> 29:27.620
Who released him?

29:29.150 --> 29:30.620
You released him?

29:30.760 --> 29:34.690
How the fuck do you
think I can stay here?

29:36.220 --> 29:37.850
I've been treating...

29:38.920 --> 29:42.030
El Soldat's men
for years.

29:43.850 --> 29:45.710
You motherfucker.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.290
Get out.

29:49.810 --> 29:51.470
Thank you!

29:54.050 --> 29:59.040
Zero, can you have another
look for that sniper for me?

29:59.075 --> 30:00.405
Forget the heat
signatures.

30:00.440 --> 30:02.480
Looking for a void
of some kind.

30:03.300 --> 30:04.585
The rocks retain
heat.

30:04.620 --> 30:06.440
There should be
some kind of displacement.

30:08.360 --> 30:10.340
Bravo, I think
I've found him.

30:10.500 --> 30:13.570
Forwarding angle, elevation,
and stellar triangulation.

30:13.930 --> 30:15.370
Copy that.

30:16.400 --> 30:17.810
Get me Othmani.

30:18.940 --> 30:21.970
Bravo, request immediate
contact with prisoner.

30:23.420 --> 30:24.830
Oy. Here.

30:29.130 --> 30:31.010
We have nothing
more to say.

30:31.280 --> 30:33.970
The game, it's over.
You lost, remember?

30:34.005 --> 30:37.696
Your friend isn't the traitor.
You killed the wrong person.

30:40.320 --> 30:43.030
It's your brother
who betrayed you.

30:44.990 --> 30:46.755
This is what Rafik
told the CIA?

30:46.790 --> 30:50.300
El Soldat has been buying up Libyan arms
and selling them to whoever's paying.

30:50.490 --> 30:53.510
He never gave a shit
about you or your cause.

30:53.790 --> 30:57.070
For him it's only ever
been about money and power.

30:57.700 --> 31:01.590
I have proof-- CIA recordings
of the initial interview.

31:01.840 --> 31:03.350
Faked.

31:05.040 --> 31:09.560
El soldat laughed at his brother

31:11.920 --> 31:13.500
'little fool'

31:17.090 --> 31:19.550
He called you that
as a kid, didn't he?

31:25.020 --> 31:28.230
You told me it was because you believed
in right and wrong.

31:29.890 --> 31:32.440
But you are not a fool

31:34.930 --> 31:36.330
Are you?

31:37.160 --> 31:39.580
You're just blinded by the
love for your older brother.

31:45.960 --> 31:47.230
Take cover.

31:48.420 --> 31:54.060
You've spent your whole life doing whatever
he asked, one way or another, haven't you?

31:54.190 --> 31:58.720
What would you know? Where
I'm coming from, family is everything.

31:59.210 --> 32:00.740
Blood binds us.

32:00.750 --> 32:04.760
Because when your brother told you to bring
the triggers, you came running like a faithful dog.

32:06.790 --> 32:10.960
- He will use them in God's name.
- You don't believe that, really.

32:11.400 --> 32:13.070
Not anymore.

32:13.910 --> 32:16.695
Money is all the triggers
are to El Soldat, the next deal,

32:16.700 --> 32:19.890
and to safeguard
that deal, he needed somebody

32:19.895 --> 32:23.070
to kill his right-hand man and take down
that plane, no questions asked.

32:24.100 --> 32:26.100
Who else
but the little fool?

32:27.230 --> 32:29.424
You murdered your best friend

32:29.424 --> 32:31.233
so El Soldat could have
his triggers so the deal--

32:31.233 --> 32:36.060
There will be no deal,
because he doesn't have them.

32:42.100 --> 32:44.600
You put them on the bus
in Niamey.

32:48.540 --> 32:50.140
In the Khafir's bag.

32:50.350 --> 32:52.560
- What the fuck?
- It's not possible.

33:01.670 --> 33:03.340
Holy shit.

33:04.800 --> 33:06.640
I did not
see that one coming.

33:07.950 --> 33:11.070
Ha! Must have nearly choked when 
we grabbed that vet off the bus, huh?

33:12.040 --> 33:13.520
It's God's will.

33:13.620 --> 33:15.210
<i>Bravo,
I have movement.</i>

33:15.220 --> 33:19.170
Approximately 30 people moving
to the end of the valley behind the farmhouse.

33:19.380 --> 33:21.500
Looks like they're
prepping for a dawn attack.

33:21.510 --> 33:24.180
If we want to pack those booby traps,
now is probably a really good time.

33:25.890 --> 33:27.650
Zero, how long
have we got?

33:29.300 --> 33:31.110
Bravo, we've lost
the satellite.

33:31.270 --> 33:33.330
Man, this guy's got
impeccable timing.

33:33.470 --> 33:35.190
- Guard these
with your life. - Ok.

33:36.590 --> 33:39.870
Whoever El Soldat has at GSI
tipped him off about the sat coverage.

33:39.880 --> 33:41.430
Yeah. That's why
he waited.

33:49.060 --> 33:50.070
- You ready?
- Yeah.

33:56.310 --> 33:59.140
If they make it into the house,
we fall back to the kitchen.

34:00.880 --> 34:04.825
One more little surprise, just in case 
there's a family reunion in there.

34:04.830 --> 34:06.440
Take out El Soldat.

34:11.190 --> 34:13.010
- Father?
- Yeah?

34:13.045 --> 34:14.520
Does this work?

34:14.770 --> 34:16.120
Mike.

34:16.870 --> 34:18.520
Mind
your fingers.

34:30.159 --> 34:32.360
So, what makes you
tick, huh?

34:34.699 --> 34:39.520
For every fighter that your drones kill, 
15 women and children will die.

34:39.730 --> 34:41.270
Isn't that enough?

34:41.790 --> 34:43.370
An eye for an eye.

34:43.600 --> 34:45.040
That's it?

34:46.100 --> 34:47.480
Really?

34:48.380 --> 34:52.870
You really think you can start 
a new world on a stack of dead bodies?

34:52.880 --> 34:54.840
You should read
more history.

34:55.130 --> 34:56.699
This is how
it's done.

34:56.820 --> 34:59.870
Oh, yeah? Can't wait to read about you 
in the history books tomorrow.

35:03.670 --> 35:05.240
Open your mouth.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.310
Open your
fucking mouth.

35:07.830 --> 35:09.110
Thank you.

35:10.250 --> 35:12.920
Just in case you decide you love 
your big brother after all.

35:19.590 --> 35:21.160
See you around.

35:27.150 --> 35:30.480
We won't pick up coverage for another 
couple of hours, Major.

35:45.650 --> 35:48.190
Scott, get ready.

36:02.550 --> 36:03.960
Contact.

36:34.420 --> 36:36.940
What are you waiting for?
You wish to be martyred?

36:37.150 --> 36:38.830
Go, bring me the triggers!

37:20.950 --> 37:22.650
When I tell you, we're
running back to the house!

37:22.685 --> 37:23.960
Move!

37:24.160 --> 37:27.270
- No! I'm not running away! 
- You're not running away!

37:27.280 --> 37:29.090
- It's a tactical withdrawal!
- Move!

37:30.520 --> 37:32.350
Go! Move!

37:35.450 --> 37:36.860
Fuck!

37:37.370 --> 37:38.880
Michael!
Behind you!

37:40.470 --> 37:41.650
Michael!

37:43.160 --> 37:44.460
Move!

37:44.920 --> 37:46.210
Go!

37:49.740 --> 37:50.960
Shit!

37:54.430 --> 37:55.870
Going back!

38:00.940 --> 38:02.210
Fuck!

38:04.810 --> 38:05.810
Move!

38:09.560 --> 38:10.890
Fuck!

38:16.250 --> 38:17.770
Come on!

38:26.450 --> 38:29.200
- Into the house!
- Coming to you! - Move!

38:32.470 --> 38:33.890
Move! Now!

38:34.280 --> 38:35.610
Fuck!

38:37.440 --> 38:38.860
I'm out! I'm out!

38:38.890 --> 38:40.330
Fuck!

38:40.890 --> 38:42.090
Shit!

38:45.280 --> 38:46.770
Fuck you!

38:48.110 --> 38:50.230
Help me move this.
Scott, move!

38:50.265 --> 38:52.970
See you around, fucker.
Coming.

38:57.940 --> 38:59.770
Tell El Soldat his brother is here.

39:01.260 --> 39:03.100
Get down! Down!
Down!

39:21.040 --> 39:22.790
The triggers?

39:24.430 --> 39:25.880
Everyone get ready!

39:31.050 --> 39:32.470
Don't be afraid!

39:44.030 --> 39:45.360
Fuck.

39:45.370 --> 39:48.600
Little brother where are they?
The triggers?

39:51.550 --> 39:53.210
Who's the fucking
fool now?

39:53.940 --> 39:55.690
Glory to God!

40:17.060 --> 40:18.520
You ok?

40:35.330 --> 40:36.690
Right.

40:51.190 --> 40:53.070
We got to stop
meeting like this.

40:54.760 --> 40:56.720
What you did here
was something special.

40:58.520 --> 41:00.500
Maybe they'll give you
a medal.

41:04.250 --> 41:05.620
The triggers.

41:18.270 --> 41:19.600
Open it.

41:21.050 --> 41:22.900
I want to
see them this time.

41:36.400 --> 41:37.650
Thanks.

41:43.700 --> 41:45.390
Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

41:58.400 --> 42:00.800
<i>Bravo, this is Zero. 
Are you receiving? Over.</i>

42:01.530 --> 42:04.400
Bravo, this is Zero.
Are you receiving? Over.

42:06.120 --> 42:09.730
Bravo, this is Zero, request
immediate sitrep. Over.

42:12.090 --> 42:13.630
<i>Zero, this is Bravo.</i>

42:14.370 --> 42:16.140
We've definitely
been better.

42:17.670 --> 42:18.840
Out.

42:29.550 --> 42:31.220
Who's gonna
tell Dalton?

42:40.140 --> 42:41.400
Fuck.

42:46.910 --> 42:53.450
Zero, how long until the
Algerians get here?

42:51.160 --> 42:53.450
<i>Should be
with you any minute, Bravo.</i>

42:55.720 --> 42:57.290
Pussy.

42:58.150 --> 43:00.190
And we don't have
the triggers.

43:01.030 --> 43:04.180
<i>You have got to be fucking kidding me.
Where the hell are they?</i>

43:06.150 --> 43:07.620
Zero, this is Bravo.

43:08.550 --> 43:11.530
El Soldat is dead.
We assume you want DNA.

43:11.570 --> 43:12.930
Bravo out.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.390
Slick.

43:17.700 --> 43:18.970
Thanks.

43:19.510 --> 43:20.870
No problem.

43:36.800 --> 43:38.460
Thank you
for everything you did.

43:38.810 --> 43:40.500
We'll make sure
someone gets you home.

43:43.300 --> 43:45.060
This was my home.

43:45.770 --> 43:47.480
Motherfucker!

43:55.280 --> 43:56.480
You ok?

43:58.000 --> 43:59.381
Yeah.

44:00.100 --> 44:02.550
We'll be lifted out of here
in about a half an hour.

44:03.100 --> 44:05.000
I can find
my own way back.

44:05.720 --> 44:07.200
I'm sure you can.

44:10.190 --> 44:12.510
I'm sorry
for your losses.

44:13.650 --> 44:16.440
We couldn't have done this without 
the help of your men.

44:17.940 --> 44:20.800
- If you need a hand--
- I will see what must be done is done.

44:23.920 --> 44:26.260
Next time
you're in the desert...

44:26.910 --> 44:28.290
Yeah.

44:30.400 --> 44:33.810
You nomads tend to move
around, though, huh?

44:35.880 --> 44:38.430
If you wish,
you will find me.

44:48.390 --> 44:49.830
<i>Nice work.</i>

44:49.850 --> 44:54.130
El Soldat is a major scalp for 20.
That in itself justifies what we're doing here.

44:54.140 --> 44:56.510
But we still do not
have the triggers.

44:56.515 --> 45:00.740
So... clean up, and then
we are back in business.

45:00.920 --> 45:02.860
Ma'am?
I think I've got him.

45:03.400 --> 45:06.700
- The guy who set up the charity
that shipped the triggers. - That's him.

45:06.735 --> 45:09.020
Ex-legionnaire
Karl Matlock.

45:09.240 --> 45:12.365
US citizen. Awarded the legion
d'honneur in Afghanistan.

45:12.400 --> 45:15.490
Fuck me. They don't just
hand that shit out to anyone.

45:15.540 --> 45:17.805
Since then, he's
gone freelance--

45:17.840 --> 45:20.180
Chad, Rwanda, Sudan.

45:20.190 --> 45:23.511
Find out where he is, because 
that is where we need to be.

45:24.550 --> 45:27.170
Western Cape, South Africa

45:27.215 --> 45:30.180
- Hip hip. 
- Hooray!

45:30.270 --> 45:31.800
Thank you, sweetheart.

45:44.650 --> 45:48.190
- Here. You wanted results.
- Thank you.

45:48.670 --> 45:50.830
Imagine what
I can do with these.

45:52.680 --> 45:55.040
We should limit our
contact from now on.

45:56.630 --> 45:58.720
Recruitment
for "Nostromo"?

45:59.800 --> 46:05.710
Circuit's quiet right now, so we should have 
the best people beating a path to our door.

46:11.100 --> 46:13.550
Cape Town, South Africa

46:13.840 --> 46:15.660
First time
in Cape Town, sir?

46:16.840 --> 46:19.140
Business
or pleasure?

46:21.330 --> 46:23.740
A little of both,
I hope.
