(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:02.436 --> 00:05.539
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:05.573 --> 00:08.309
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.342 --> 00:10.178
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.211 --> 00:11.545
are members
of an elite squad

00:11.579 --> 00:13.447
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.481 --> 00:15.149
These are their stories.

00:16.784 --> 00:19.353
Second straight month
of nights.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.055
My old lady's
leaving me for sure.

00:21.089 --> 00:22.223
No, keep her
on fresh batteries, man.

00:22.256 --> 00:23.224
She'll stay put.

00:23.257 --> 00:24.225
Huh, batteries?

00:24.258 --> 00:25.226
Yeah, you know, for that

00:25.259 --> 00:27.428
small appliance she keeps
under her pillow.

00:27.461 --> 00:30.064
Bigger and better than you.
[laughs]

00:30.098 --> 00:31.132
[mock laughs]

00:31.165 --> 00:33.434
Come on, Kurtz. I'm just
squeezing your tea bag, man.

00:33.467 --> 00:34.435
Hey, wait a second.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.237
Check it out.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.454
[shovel grinding]

00:56.590 --> 00:58.192
Police!
Hold it right there!

00:58.226 --> 00:59.193
What are you doing out here?

00:59.227 --> 01:00.261
Nothing illegal.

01:00.294 --> 01:01.262
You're digging up a dirt lot

01:01.295 --> 01:02.263
in the middle of the night.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.397
We need some ID

01:03.431 --> 01:05.233
and a damn good explanation
or we're taking your ass in.

01:05.266 --> 01:06.234
On what charge?

01:06.267 --> 01:07.235
You know the drill.

01:07.268 --> 01:08.502
Assume the position!

01:08.536 --> 01:10.804
Got anything on you, huh?

01:10.838 --> 01:12.240
[handcuffs lock]

01:20.481 --> 01:21.782
Doesn't hurt much.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.817
Well, it will.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.221
Thanks for coming.

01:29.857 --> 01:32.593
I didn't know
who else to call.

01:32.626 --> 01:33.894
What about Fin?

01:33.927 --> 01:36.830
My father's not an option.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.832
You're being charged with drunk
and disorderly conduct,

01:38.866 --> 01:41.302
resisting arrest,
and assaulting a police officer.

01:41.335 --> 01:42.470
That's a felony, Ken!

01:42.503 --> 01:43.471
They're lying.

01:43.504 --> 01:44.605
They're lying?

01:44.638 --> 01:47.608
They're claiming that you
attacked them with a shovel.

01:47.641 --> 01:48.476
One cop slammed me
into a fence.

01:48.509 --> 01:51.145
He--he lost his footing
and went down.

01:51.179 --> 01:52.646
His partner thought
I pushed him.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.348
Next thing I know, I'm getting
wailed on with a f--

01:54.382 --> 01:56.884
With a flashlight and--

01:56.917 --> 01:58.852
I wasn't drunk.

01:58.886 --> 01:59.920
I had a couple
drinks earlier.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.189
That's all.

02:01.222 --> 02:02.256
Did you have a shovel?

02:02.290 --> 02:03.524
Yes.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.193
Why?

02:06.894 --> 02:08.762
Ken, what were you doing

02:08.796 --> 02:11.465
in that lot in the middle
of the night with a shovel?

02:14.335 --> 02:17.238
Look, if you're not gonna tell
me, then I can't help you.

02:20.874 --> 02:23.477
Okay. Guard.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.216
I was looking for something.

02:30.551 --> 02:31.919
What?

02:34.222 --> 02:37.157
A body.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.743
We're trying to get
the charges vacated.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.545
Elliot and Olivia
are talking to Ken now.

03:31.579 --> 03:32.913
There's nothing you can do.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.848
Get outta my way.
You're not
going in there.

03:34.882 --> 03:35.883
That's my son
in there, Captain.

03:35.916 --> 03:36.917
Why didn't you call me?

03:36.950 --> 03:38.386
Because he didn't want us to.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.688
He's over 18
and he's in a lot of trouble.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.390
You plan on making it worse?

03:42.423 --> 03:43.791
I plan on asking him
what the hell he was doing

03:43.824 --> 03:44.792
looking for a body.

03:44.825 --> 03:45.626
When you should be
asking him

03:45.659 --> 03:47.261
why he called Olivia
instead of you.

03:47.295 --> 03:48.329
That's a separate issue

03:48.362 --> 03:49.830
and trust me,
I will address that.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.365
No doubt
with your usual diplomacy.

03:51.399 --> 03:52.466
What goes on
between me and my son

03:52.500 --> 03:54.335
is none of your damn business.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.669
But it is mine.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.038
And right now,

03:58.071 --> 03:59.540
all I wanna know
is whose body it is,

03:59.573 --> 04:00.541
where it is,

04:00.574 --> 04:03.043
and who put it there.

04:03.076 --> 04:06.480
You mind if I listen in?

04:06.514 --> 04:07.548
He's got a few bruises.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.049
He'll be sore,
but he'll live.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.551
And the arresting officers
are getting looked at,

04:10.584 --> 04:12.019
so don't make trouble.

04:12.052 --> 04:13.521
(Benson)
Let's back up, Ken.

04:13.554 --> 04:14.955
Just start at the beginning.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.425
I was having drinks
with my cousin, Darius,

04:17.458 --> 04:21.429
in some dive bar around 9:00
when I overheard this guy

04:21.462 --> 04:24.965
talking about how he'd killed
some woman a couple years ago

04:24.998 --> 04:26.834
and got away with it.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.570
He said he--he raped her
with a knife and buried the body

04:29.603 --> 04:30.971
in the vacant lot.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.740
What bar?

04:32.773 --> 04:35.309
The Deuce.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.845
On 129th and Lenox.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.447
(Benson)
Did you know the guy?

04:39.480 --> 04:40.814
No.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.082
Ken, you're a smart guy.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.518
So, explain to us

04:44.552 --> 04:47.655
why you body hunting
in the middle of the night

04:47.688 --> 04:50.023
based on what some stranger
says in a bar.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.325
I mean--

04:51.359 --> 04:52.360
That doesn't add up.

04:52.393 --> 04:55.396
The way he talked,
it sounded real to me.

04:55.429 --> 04:58.899
You know, he said
the lot was by the park.

04:58.932 --> 05:01.034
I remember that one
being semi-secluded.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.403
I had to know.

05:02.436 --> 05:04.071
So, why didn't you
go to the police?

05:04.104 --> 05:05.973
I didn't think
they'd believe me.

05:06.006 --> 05:06.974
You don't.

05:07.007 --> 05:09.477
Could you describe the guy?

05:09.510 --> 05:13.347
Black. Mid-20s.

05:13.381 --> 05:14.448
Uh--

05:14.482 --> 05:17.585
Under six feet.
Medium build.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.920
Puffy jacket.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.555
Uh, blue jeans,
white T-shirt.

05:21.589 --> 05:22.956
Okay, did he have
any distinguishing marks

05:22.990 --> 05:24.725
like tattoos, or scars,

05:24.758 --> 05:25.726
anything like that?

05:25.759 --> 05:26.727
No.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.829
Catch his name?

05:28.862 --> 05:32.533
Did you ask anyone else in
the bar whether they knew him?

05:32.566 --> 05:37.037
Did you hear him call
any of his friends by name?

05:37.070 --> 05:38.071
Not that I remember.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.239
So, even if you had found
a body,

05:39.272 --> 05:41.842
you wouldn't have been able
to lead us to the killer.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.580
Is that your story, Ken?

05:46.614 --> 05:50.083
What's your problem?
I-I'm trying to cooperate.

05:50.117 --> 05:52.553
I don't even know
if what he said was true.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.588
[knocking on window]

05:59.560 --> 06:01.829
You practically treated my kid
like anybody off the street.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.531
Why don't you believe him?

06:03.564 --> 06:05.098
His body language
is all over the place.

06:05.132 --> 06:08.436
Think he was trying
to protect somebody?

06:08.469 --> 06:09.470
Or himself.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.572
That story was too soft.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.441
He didn't think it through.

06:13.474 --> 06:15.509
If he put a body out there,
Elliot, why dig it up?

06:15.543 --> 06:17.511
New construction's going on
all over this city.

06:17.545 --> 06:20.047
Maybe he wanted to move it
before some contractor found it.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.749
(Munch)
Well, without a murder victim
this is pure conjecture.

06:21.782 --> 06:22.816
(Stabler)
Fine, look, dig up the lot.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.552
See if there's anything
under there.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.119
Till we know who we're looking
for I can't authorize it.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.788
Check the files first
for possible victims

06:27.821 --> 06:29.523
against Ken's statement.

06:29.557 --> 06:30.491
Wait a minute, you're saying
my son's not only a liar,

06:30.524 --> 06:31.525
he's a murderer too.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.427
Look, I don't know,

06:33.461 --> 06:35.863
but you're the first to admit
you really don't know him.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.197
Like you know yours, right?

06:37.230 --> 06:38.666
Tell me, is your daughter
still driving drunk,

06:38.699 --> 06:40.200
or has she moved up
to something stronger?

06:40.233 --> 06:41.769
All right,
take it easy.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.471
Next thing you know, she's
gonna be swinging off a pole.

06:43.504 --> 06:44.472
Elliot!

06:44.505 --> 06:45.606
Walk it off.
Now!

06:49.577 --> 06:51.178
Now, that's enough.
You focus on your son.

06:51.211 --> 06:53.581
The interview's over.
Get him home.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.549
And talk to his cousin,
Darius.

06:55.583 --> 06:56.784
See if he heard
the same story.

06:58.486 --> 06:59.720
Captain?

06:59.753 --> 07:03.857
You really think Ken's
involved in a murder?

07:03.891 --> 07:05.793
I think he's lying.

07:05.826 --> 07:08.462
I wanna know why.

07:11.832 --> 07:12.800
Oh, my God.

07:12.833 --> 07:13.901
What happened to you?

07:13.934 --> 07:15.202
It's not a big deal, Mom.

07:15.235 --> 07:16.036
Yes, it is.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.771
He got pinched
on a class C felony

07:17.805 --> 07:18.772
and two misdemeanors.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.608
For what?
What do we need to do?

07:20.641 --> 07:22.042
Why are you asking him?

07:22.075 --> 07:23.511
I can handle this myself.

07:23.544 --> 07:24.512
Yeah.

07:24.545 --> 07:28.549
Looks like
you got it covered.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.584
I'm going to bed.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.957
That look doesn't
work on me anymore.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.559
Our son was beaten and arrested

07:38.592 --> 07:40.193
and you couldn't
pick up a phone?

07:40.227 --> 07:41.261
I just found out myself.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.596
I'm looking for Darius.

07:42.630 --> 07:43.597
You know
where I can find him?

07:43.631 --> 07:44.865
What he's got to do with this?

07:44.898 --> 07:47.067
What, something I should know?

07:47.100 --> 07:48.335
Darius is poison
and always will be.

07:48.368 --> 07:51.271
Of course you were never around
much, and that hasn't changed.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.540
You still ain't pulling
any punches.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.875
When I was working undercover,
I warned you I'd be gone a lot.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.577
You weren't gone a lot.
You were just gone.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.211
I must have been around
sometime, or is Ken not my son?

07:58.245 --> 07:59.246
I see your lips moving,

07:59.279 --> 08:01.048
but I still haven't heard
why he was in jail.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.016
Ask him, it might not
have been an issue

08:03.050 --> 08:04.685
if he had to use my last name.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.188
If you haven't heard,

08:08.221 --> 08:10.290
sperm donors don't get
parental rights.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.191
Cool.

08:11.224 --> 08:13.060
Just tell me
where Darius is and I'm gone.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.295
Al's Auto Body
on Frederick Douglass.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.897
[sighs]

08:18.131 --> 08:20.133
That's Terry's nephew
right there.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.808
It's been a long time, Fin.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.210
Detective Munch.
Darius Parker.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.579
Nice sculpture.

08:31.612 --> 08:32.746
Yeah, you know,

08:32.780 --> 08:34.582
I dabble a little bit.

08:34.615 --> 08:37.585
But, I know you all
not here to discuss any art.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.587
Fin here's not
for the small talk.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.589
Were you with Ken last night?

08:41.622 --> 08:44.091
Yeah, we had a few
at the Deuce last night.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.258
Left around midnight.

08:45.292 --> 08:46.894
Did he tell you
where he was going?

08:46.927 --> 08:49.196
Figured home, just like me.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.297
Is something wrong?

08:50.330 --> 08:51.965
He seem upset?

08:51.999 --> 08:54.234
Man, you know he's always
twisting over something, man.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.269
His grades,
his beef with you.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.038
Being gay.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.573
It's just the way he is.

08:59.607 --> 09:01.174
You hear anyone
talk about a murder?

09:01.208 --> 09:04.745
No. Why?

09:04.778 --> 09:05.813
Your cousin claims he did.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.314
He was digging for a body
when the cops pinched him.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.683
What?

09:09.717 --> 09:11.585
That's crazy.

09:11.619 --> 09:14.021
He didn't discuss going
treasure hunting with you?

09:14.054 --> 09:15.956
There's no way
I would have let him if he had.

09:15.989 --> 09:18.058
Besides, man,
the Deuce is a thug bar.

09:18.091 --> 09:21.128
I wouldn't be surprised to find
a killer or two up in it.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.930
There's a lot of places
to drink, why go there?

09:22.963 --> 09:25.265
Look, Fin, I'm straight, man.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.868
I'm not like I used to be
at all.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.803
No matter what Terry says.

09:29.837 --> 09:31.304
(Munch)
You got a sheet?

09:31.338 --> 09:32.673
(Darius)
Burglary...

09:32.706 --> 09:34.608
assault, narcotics.

09:34.642 --> 09:37.377
But it's all ancient history.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.047
Okay, there's one open
burglary charge.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.315
But, I didn't do it.
I couldn't have.

09:42.349 --> 09:43.984
And why is that?

09:44.017 --> 09:46.019
'Cause I was robbing
somebody else.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.023
It's a joke, fellas.
Lighten up.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.058
I'm not in the game anymore.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.694
Rikers straightened you out?

09:53.727 --> 09:56.163
You know that gated community
doesn't do rehab, man.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.065
I did it for myself.

09:58.098 --> 10:01.134
If I don't care about me...
nobody will.

10:01.168 --> 10:02.936
(Fin)
Well, you may wanna
sit Ken down

10:02.970 --> 10:08.075
and explain that to him, 'cause
right now I can't reach him.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.710
You went pretty hard at Fin.

10:09.743 --> 10:13.113
I only called it like I saw it.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.916
Did you know Ken Randall has
a file in the juvenile system?

10:15.949 --> 10:17.918
No.

10:17.951 --> 10:21.021
I knew there was something off
with that kid.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.123
I got a hit off CARS.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.958
Either Fin's covering for him,
or he doesn't know.

10:24.992 --> 10:25.959
What are the charges?

10:25.993 --> 10:27.961
It's sealed.
I got a request in.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.263
Ken lied to us, Olivia.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.398
You and I both know that.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.400
Kids lie.
Even yours.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.836
Whether you live with them
full time or not.

10:35.869 --> 10:37.270
How are we doing on potential
murder victims?

10:37.304 --> 10:38.939
We have two possibles.

10:38.972 --> 10:42.342
A 27-year old woman went missing
from her work two years ago.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.712
A car was left abandoned.

10:44.745 --> 10:45.846
Any blood in her apartment
or vehicle?

10:45.879 --> 10:47.147
Uh-uh.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.415
Well, if this guy raped her
with a knife,

10:48.448 --> 10:50.183
there'd be blood
and a lot of it.

10:50.217 --> 10:51.084
Which leads us
to Nina Stansfield.

10:51.118 --> 10:52.920
30-year-old female
and her toddler son.

10:52.953 --> 10:55.789
Disappeared three years ago
from their apartment.

10:55.823 --> 10:56.824
Doesn't fit
Ken's statement either.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.025
He never mentioned a baby.

10:58.058 --> 10:58.859
Well, listen to this.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.460
Approximately
seven pints of blood

11:00.493 --> 11:02.996
belonging to the victim
were left at the scene,

11:03.030 --> 11:05.733
along with a bloody four-inch
knife with an engraved hilt.

11:05.766 --> 11:08.001
And the lab found vaginal
epithelials on the blade.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.870
There's foreign DNA
on the carpet.

11:09.903 --> 11:12.005
And although it didn't match
her husband, Steven,

11:12.039 --> 11:13.140
he's still the prime suspect.

11:13.173 --> 11:16.043
Let me guess, he has a history
of domestic violence.

11:16.076 --> 11:18.011
Three D.V. calls six months
before she disappeared.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.312
Have Munch check
with the husband.

11:19.346 --> 11:22.049
See if he frequents the Deuce.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.053
[knocking on door]

11:26.086 --> 11:28.488
[door opens]

11:28.521 --> 11:31.825
I didn't kill my wife.

11:33.894 --> 11:36.096
I know you don't believe that.
Nobody does.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.966
But I didn't do it.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.367
According to your neighbors,
Mr. Stansfield,

11:40.400 --> 11:43.336
you and your wife
didn't get along.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.838
Yeah, we had
a lot of problems.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.506
And yes, we fought.
But I didn't hate her.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.442
Or my son, so, why is it you
people still think I'm guilty?

11:49.476 --> 11:53.881
There's no way I would have
hurt my wife and child.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.182
Who else could have done it?

11:55.215 --> 11:57.017
I don't know.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.854
I'd never seen so much--

12:00.888 --> 12:03.390
Blood.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.958
And even though
there was no body,

12:04.992 --> 12:07.060
they tell me that Nina's dead.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.095
That she couldn't
have survived it.

12:08.128 --> 12:10.463
But where is my son?

12:10.497 --> 12:13.333
The police will not tell me
a thing.

12:13.366 --> 12:20.440
But they sure as hell talked to
my in-laws, my boss, my friends,

12:20.473 --> 12:22.876
and labeled me a killer.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.444
Did you ever have problems
with anyone?

12:24.477 --> 12:26.914
Nothing serious.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.048
Arguments with sitters.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.217
About their boyfriend,
talking on the phone too much.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.086
I couldn't afford sitters
in the first place,

12:33.120 --> 12:34.988
but she just had to go out.

12:35.022 --> 12:36.056
Go out where?

12:36.089 --> 12:37.991
Happy hour.

12:38.025 --> 12:38.992
Dinners.

12:39.026 --> 12:41.895
With her friends.

12:41.929 --> 12:47.400
I don't know.
Reliving her single glory days.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.469
Was she cheating on you?

12:49.502 --> 12:53.340
According to the police,
it's why I killed her.

12:53.373 --> 12:56.109
How could I possibly know
something like that

12:56.143 --> 13:00.113
when I was always at work so she
could be at home with the baby?

13:00.147 --> 13:02.115
You ever go to a bar
called the Deuce?

13:02.149 --> 13:02.983
No.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.551
I'm not welcome
in that neighborhood.

13:04.584 --> 13:09.289
So I have to do
my drinking at home.

13:09.322 --> 13:13.827
Speaking of which,
do you mind?

13:13.861 --> 13:18.065
I'd like to get started.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.566
Husband's a wreck, Captain.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.301
We'll pull the murder book
and go back over the canvass.

13:21.334 --> 13:22.102
That's not necessary.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.838
Ken Randall is now
a viable suspect

13:24.872 --> 13:26.606
in the Stansfield homicide.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.308
I've already started a file

13:28.341 --> 13:30.043
and authorized an excavation

13:30.077 --> 13:33.080
for the lot
for tomorrow morning.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.949
Were you aware your son was
charged with sexual assault

13:35.983 --> 13:37.617
of a neighborhood girl
when he was 16?

13:37.650 --> 13:39.186
No.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.889
Charges were dropped
when the girl recanted.

13:41.922 --> 13:42.923
You ever think she might
have changed her story

13:42.956 --> 13:43.957
'cause she lied to the police?

13:43.991 --> 13:46.093
Well, I intend to find out.

13:46.126 --> 13:47.560
Do I need to remind you
to stay hands off

13:47.594 --> 13:48.561
during this investigation?

13:48.595 --> 13:50.497
No, sir.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.065
(Munch)
Five-year-old vacated charge

13:52.099 --> 13:53.066
is a reach, Captain.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.601
What's the motive?

13:54.634 --> 13:57.037
Where's the connection between
Fin's son and the victim?

13:57.070 --> 13:58.205
Proximity.

13:58.238 --> 14:00.173
Ken Randall and his mother
used to live in the building

14:00.207 --> 14:03.143
across the street
from the crime scene.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.112
But since your partner
already knows that,

14:05.145 --> 14:06.980
I guess lying
runs in the family.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.181
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

14:08.215 --> 14:09.216
Why would you hide
something like that?

14:09.249 --> 14:10.583
I'm trying to protect my son.

14:10.617 --> 14:11.584
(Munch)
From what?

14:11.618 --> 14:12.552
You think he did this?

14:12.585 --> 14:14.421
I think if you can make
a case against him,

14:14.454 --> 14:16.523
it won't matter
whether he did it or not.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.025
Nobody in my department
cuts corners

14:18.058 --> 14:19.426
or goes for an easy close.

14:19.459 --> 14:22.095
And that's your opinion,
Captain.

14:22.129 --> 14:23.363
And for your son's sake,
you better be grateful

14:23.396 --> 14:26.066
it's the only one that matters.

14:34.307 --> 14:35.575
Body part!

14:35.608 --> 14:37.577
So, how many people are
actually down there?

14:37.610 --> 14:40.047
We found three so far,
with additional body parts

14:40.080 --> 14:41.048
I can't account for.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.349
We'll be digging for a while.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.316
You thinking serial killer?

14:43.350 --> 14:45.118
It doesn't look like it.

14:45.152 --> 14:47.654
As far as I can tell, they're
all male and different races.

14:47.687 --> 14:50.991
No children,
and so far, no women.

14:51.024 --> 14:54.261
I'll know more once I get 'em
all back to the morgue.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.596
This is prime real estate if you
want somebody to just disappear.

14:56.629 --> 14:58.198
It's not the first time

14:58.231 --> 15:00.500
an impromptu graveyard
has been found in this city.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.435
A perfect dumping ground
for the usual suspects.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.171
Dirty cops, drug dealers,
wise guys.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.239
It's possible.

15:06.273 --> 15:09.142
But I can't tell you that until
I put names to the remains.

15:09.176 --> 15:11.378
They used to just put
concrete shoes on people

15:11.411 --> 15:13.113
and dump 'em in the river.

15:13.146 --> 15:14.414
How long is this gonna take?

15:14.447 --> 15:17.117
I'll test what I have
against the victim's DNA.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.186
But, my office is probably
going be working for weeks,

15:19.219 --> 15:21.588
maybe even months trying to
figure out who these people are.

15:21.621 --> 15:22.889
I'm looking for just one.

15:22.922 --> 15:26.359
If I find a female victim here,
I'll walk her through myself.

15:28.128 --> 15:28.895
Am I the first one here?

15:28.928 --> 15:31.698
Munch called.
He's running late.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.733
The sexual assault charge
against Ken Randall was bogus.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.202
Apparently, she was a friend.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.236
She tried to have sex with him

15:36.269 --> 15:37.670
to prove he wasn't gay.

15:37.704 --> 15:38.738
That always works.

15:38.771 --> 15:39.739
Yeah, Ken pushed her away,

15:39.772 --> 15:41.141
and she got bruised.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.109
When her father confronted her,
she lied.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.111
Some friend.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.612
Well, she told
the truth eventually.
(Munch)
Captain.

15:45.645 --> 15:50.750
Well, let's hope
Ken follows her example.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.252
Hi, I'm Captain Cragen,

15:52.285 --> 15:55.322
and this is Assistant District
Attorney Novak.

15:55.355 --> 15:56.689
Theresa Randall.

15:56.723 --> 15:57.890
Is there somewhere I can wait?

15:57.924 --> 16:00.160
Uh, there's a lounge upstairs,
or you can use my office.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.129
Thank you.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.364
We should get started.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.166
Without counsel
for the defense?

16:06.199 --> 16:08.035
Kathleen Summers.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.269
I'm your lawyer.

16:09.302 --> 16:12.105
And I only have one rule.

16:12.139 --> 16:14.074
You don't speak
unless I say so.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.075
Are we clear?

16:15.108 --> 16:16.243
Yes.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.678
Anytime you're ready.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.980
(Novak)
Come with me, please.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.252
You and I need to talk.

16:25.285 --> 16:26.219
Talk or yell?

16:26.253 --> 16:29.189
That's up to you.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.757
Do you wanna revise
your statement, Ken?

16:30.790 --> 16:32.459
You can answer that.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.361
No.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.329
You dug up a vacant lot
looking for a body

16:36.363 --> 16:38.231
from a story
you heard in a bar.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.500
You didn't tell us
about the baby.

16:40.533 --> 16:41.534
You left that part out.

16:41.568 --> 16:42.535
What baby?

16:42.569 --> 16:44.104
I didn't hear anything
about a kid.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.238
Did you know Nina Stansfield?

16:45.272 --> 16:46.806
Don't answer that.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.241
(Novak)
It's innocuous, Counselor.

16:48.275 --> 16:50.610
Either he knew the victim,
or he didn't.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.279
That's for you to prove,
Ms. Novak.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.681
My client is not going
to do your job for you.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.283
Were you ever
in the Stansfield apartment?

16:56.316 --> 16:58.485
He's not answering that
either.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.220
He admitted to police
he was looking for a body.

17:00.253 --> 17:01.288
We identified a victim

17:01.321 --> 17:03.223
with his lead.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.691
(Munch)
All that was left of her
was seven pints of blood,

17:04.724 --> 17:08.128
and vaginal cells
on the murder weapon.

17:08.161 --> 17:09.796
She was raped with a knife.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.364
Just like Ken said.

17:11.398 --> 17:12.765
And this young man had knowledge
of the crime

17:12.799 --> 17:15.368
and he lived
right across the street.

17:15.402 --> 17:16.369
Which is all suggestive.

17:16.403 --> 17:18.171
Not substantive.

17:18.205 --> 17:19.539
Anything else?

17:19.572 --> 17:21.508
Ken.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.243
Volunteer a DNA sample

17:23.276 --> 17:25.278
and get on with your life.

17:25.312 --> 17:27.847
You're not going to get that
without a court order.

17:27.880 --> 17:34.121
And based on this conversation,
no judge will sign it.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.325
You're not doing our son
any favors

17:38.358 --> 17:39.759
by getting him an attorney.

17:39.792 --> 17:42.295
He's the only suspect in what
looks like a double homicide.

17:42.329 --> 17:43.463
I'm protecting him.

17:43.496 --> 17:44.864
From what?

17:44.897 --> 17:48.135
Fin, he didn't do this,
so make him cooperate.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.102
Come on, prison's are filled
with innocent people,

17:49.136 --> 17:52.205
and we both know what color
most of them are.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.673
So, you don't trust
the people you work with?

17:53.706 --> 17:55.842
I don't trust the system.

17:55.875 --> 17:58.111
Not completely.

17:58.145 --> 17:59.112
What you're doing
isn't the answer.

17:59.146 --> 18:00.180
He needs direction.

18:00.213 --> 18:03.216
I can't teach him
how to be a man by myself, Fin.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.351
So, what do you expect me to do?

18:04.384 --> 18:05.352
Be his father,

18:05.385 --> 18:06.686
not his friend.

18:06.719 --> 18:09.556
He knows more about
the situation than he's telling,

18:09.589 --> 18:12.525
and he's lying
through his teeth.

18:12.559 --> 18:13.793
A man wouldn't do that.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.562
At least not
a good one like you.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.271
You looking for something?

18:24.304 --> 18:27.174
The Stansfield crime scene
photos and sketches.

18:32.745 --> 18:34.147
All you had to do was ask.

18:34.181 --> 18:35.715
All you had to do was pick up
the phone.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.652
You have something
you want to get off your chest?

18:39.686 --> 18:40.887
Yeah, you crossed the line.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.256
When my son contacted you, I
should have been the next call.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.658
You think you know
what's right for my son

18:45.692 --> 18:47.427
better than I do
and you don't.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.662
That can't happen again.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.764
Come on.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.234
He asked me for my help.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.702
What did you want me to do?
Say no?

18:55.735 --> 18:58.471
It's not your place to make
decisions for my family, Olivia.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.873
You keep running interference
between me and my son,

19:00.907 --> 19:02.509
you and I are gonna have
a problem.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.344
That wasn't my intention.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.313
I understand.
You're just trying to help.

19:06.346 --> 19:07.747
But, my son and I have
a lot to work out

19:07.780 --> 19:09.882
and we're not gonna get anywhere
with you in the way.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.318
You're right.

19:11.351 --> 19:13.653
And I'm sorry.

19:13.686 --> 19:14.854
But I think the real reason

19:14.887 --> 19:18.157
you're pissed off is 'cause
you're boxed into a corner.

19:21.961 --> 19:25.332
So, what's your next move?

19:25.365 --> 19:26.399
There's nothing I need to do.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.201
Isn't there?

19:28.235 --> 19:30.737
I know that Warner's finished
with her preliminary findings.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.272
None of those bodies
from the lot

19:32.305 --> 19:33.273
match the victim.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.942
That tells me Ken didn't do it.

19:35.975 --> 19:37.710
No, it tells you
that we can't prove it.

19:37.744 --> 19:41.581
We don't have enough evidence
to get a warrant for his DNA.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.250
Do you really want this cloud

19:43.283 --> 19:47.487
hanging over your son
for the rest of his life?

19:48.988 --> 19:50.757
Or don't you want to know?

19:50.790 --> 19:53.760
I'm getting looks from cops
I've known for years.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.795
The same glare we give to humps
in there.

19:55.828 --> 19:58.298
Even if I gotta take the freeze
for the duration,

19:58.331 --> 20:02.269
I'm not gonna sacrifice my kid
for this job ever again.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.404
DNA is only way
to exonerate him.

20:04.437 --> 20:06.806
And what if it doesn't?
I'm his father.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.975
And you're also a cop.

20:09.008 --> 20:12.612
And no matter
how hard you try...

20:12.645 --> 20:16.983
there's no way
to separate the two.

20:20.052 --> 20:23.256
My attorney said not to give you
DNA without a subpoena.

20:23.290 --> 20:24.991
And I'm asking you to go
with Munch to the lab

20:25.024 --> 20:26.659
to volunteer a sample.

20:26.693 --> 20:27.627
It's a chain
of evidence issue,

20:27.660 --> 20:28.761
otherwise your father
would take you himself.

20:28.795 --> 20:32.332
What, your cop friends need
proof I'm not a killer,

20:32.365 --> 20:33.333
or is it you?

20:33.366 --> 20:34.967
It's not them.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.404
You're my son.
I love you.

20:37.437 --> 20:40.006
But a woman's dead, her son's
gone, her husband's destroyed.

20:40.039 --> 20:43.543
That's gotta mean
something to you.

20:43.576 --> 20:47.414
I need you to decide right now
what kind of man you want to be.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.051
I've got your son's
lab results.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.586
Is it a match?

20:53.620 --> 20:55.422
I know it's not.

20:55.455 --> 20:57.824
It's both.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.759
The killer's DNA found
at the crime scene

20:59.792 --> 21:02.662
and your son's specimen have
the same mitochondria.

21:02.695 --> 21:03.896
You're saying they're related?

21:03.930 --> 21:06.566
Darius,
Ken's cousin.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.034
Are they close?
(Fin)
They're tight.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.970
That explains why Ken was trying
to protect him.

21:11.003 --> 21:11.971
The killer can't be
your son's cousin.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.340
You're looking
for his brother.

21:13.373 --> 21:15.475
That's not possible.

21:15.508 --> 21:17.410
My ex-wife never had
any other children.

21:17.444 --> 21:18.845
(Warner)
DNA doesn't lie, Detective.

21:18.878 --> 21:21.748
Half of these markers
contain the same genes

21:21.781 --> 21:22.982
carrying the same code

21:23.015 --> 21:25.352
in precisely
the same sequence.

21:25.385 --> 21:28.488
The killer and your son
have the same mother.

21:36.095 --> 21:37.964
How'd you find out?

21:37.997 --> 21:39.632
Nobody knows Darius is my son.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.000
Not even Ken.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.101
We checked Ken's DNA
against what was left

21:42.134 --> 21:43.102
at the crime scene.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.103
You should have told me.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.505
It happened before I met you.

21:45.538 --> 21:46.506
So, why'd you give him up?

21:46.539 --> 21:47.306
He had to go somewhere.

21:47.340 --> 21:49.542
He certainly couldn't stay
with me.

21:49.576 --> 21:52.979
I was 16
and his father was a bastard.

21:55.114 --> 21:57.817
You don't know
what he did to me.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.786
Darius looks just like him.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.888
I guess he's starting to act
like him too.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.055
So, why not put him
up for adoption?

22:03.089 --> 22:04.991
Why give him to your mother
to raise?

22:05.024 --> 22:06.859
I didn't give her anything!
She took.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.361
You knew her.

22:08.395 --> 22:10.597
She wouldn't allow blood
out of the family.

22:10.630 --> 22:13.032
Where's the father now?

22:13.065 --> 22:15.568
I don't know.
I hope he's dead.

22:15.602 --> 22:17.470
What happened to you, Terry?

22:17.504 --> 22:19.672
I will not--

22:19.706 --> 22:21.808
I won't talk about that.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.543
Not to you.

22:23.576 --> 22:24.711
Not to anyone.

22:24.744 --> 22:27.146
Well, maybe that's
the real problem.

22:27.179 --> 22:28.681
You don't know what it's like
to have to look at someone

22:28.715 --> 22:32.051
that has the face
of someone you hate!

22:32.084 --> 22:34.387
Every time
he came over to see Ken.

22:34.421 --> 22:36.689
Every time he came
to family functions,

22:36.723 --> 22:38.625
it made me sick.

22:40.760 --> 22:45.865
I can't stand
to look at Darius.

22:45.898 --> 22:48.000
Even now.

22:48.034 --> 22:51.003
Does Darius know
you're his mother?

22:51.037 --> 22:54.407
I don't see how.

22:54.441 --> 22:55.708
My mother's been dead
three years,

22:55.742 --> 22:59.746
and nobody else in my family
would tell him.

23:03.450 --> 23:04.684
(Huang)
Interesting family dynamic.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.586
Damn freak show.

23:06.619 --> 23:07.754
We belong in
one of your textbooks

23:07.787 --> 23:09.155
with the rest
of the fruit loops.

23:09.188 --> 23:10.623
The day is still young.

23:10.657 --> 23:11.891
So, what's our next move?

23:11.924 --> 23:13.526
Pick up Darius.
Put him in the room.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.995
Given his priors, I'd rather
have more ammunition.

23:16.028 --> 23:17.229
You think we need
a confession?

23:17.263 --> 23:20.533
What he said to someone else
is hearsay and is inadmissible.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.201
And I can't put
the knife in his hand.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.202
(Huang)
Wait a minute.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.605
The infant is the key.

23:25.638 --> 23:27.006
Darius confessed to your son

23:27.039 --> 23:28.741
that he raped a woman
with a knife.

23:28.775 --> 23:30.443
He admitted to taking
her body and burying it.

23:30.477 --> 23:32.445
So, why leave out
the second victim?

23:32.479 --> 23:33.446
It bothers him.

23:33.480 --> 23:34.380
Give his maternal history,

23:34.413 --> 23:37.116
I think he was identifying
with the child.

23:37.149 --> 23:39.486
Abandoned by a mother
who didn't want him.

23:39.519 --> 23:40.520
But why kill the baby?

23:40.553 --> 23:42.555
Self loathing.

23:42.589 --> 23:44.491
He's a reject.

23:44.524 --> 23:46.993
A pariah that not even
a mother could love.

23:47.026 --> 23:48.695
Darius may have thought
that he was saving the boy

23:48.728 --> 23:50.563
the pain of living.

23:50.597 --> 23:53.099
Yeah, that makes sense if he
found out Terry was his mother.

23:53.132 --> 23:54.601
But how would he have known?

23:54.634 --> 23:56.002
Your ex was pretty adamant

23:56.035 --> 23:56.869
that didn't happen.

23:56.903 --> 23:59.071
Yeah, she sees
what she wants to see.

23:59.105 --> 24:01.073
Her mother died three years ago
from cancer.

24:01.107 --> 24:03.476
I'm thinking a death bed
confession to her grandson.

24:03.510 --> 24:04.343
That's around the same time

24:04.376 --> 24:06.879
the victim and her toddler
went missing.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.815
Were there any baby items
missing from the apartment?

24:10.650 --> 24:12.151
Nothing's listed.

24:12.184 --> 24:14.821
The suspect had a relationship
with the victim.

24:14.854 --> 24:17.524
Removing the body
was an act of concealment.

24:17.557 --> 24:18.958
A stranger doesn't do that.

24:18.991 --> 24:20.727
We need to know
how Darius knew her.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.028
He spent a lot of time
with Ken hanging out

24:22.061 --> 24:24.964
in the neighborhood back then.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.733
If he just found out
who his mother really was,

24:26.766 --> 24:29.235
the tiniest conflict with the
victim could have set him off.

24:29.268 --> 24:33.906
Especially if Nina Stansfield
was a bad mother.

24:33.940 --> 24:36.843
A surrogate for all the rage
he felt for your ex-wife.

24:36.876 --> 24:39.679
Talk to the husband.
See if he can make an ID.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.814
(Munch)
Mr. Stansfield,
we found a potential suspect

24:41.848 --> 24:42.949
in your wife's murder.

24:42.982 --> 24:45.217
We need you to look
at some photos.

24:49.556 --> 24:51.190
You recognize anyone,
Mr. Stansfield?

24:57.630 --> 24:59.231
Uh.

24:59.265 --> 25:01.300
Just tell me which one he is.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.835
I will sign my name.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.871
Doesn't work like that.

25:04.904 --> 25:07.206
Please!

25:08.975 --> 25:11.243
You told police some items
were taken from your home.

25:11.277 --> 25:14.881
Were any of your son's things
among them?

25:14.914 --> 25:17.083
A rattle.

25:17.116 --> 25:18.150
It was antique.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.787
Passed down
through my wife's family.

25:20.820 --> 25:21.788
Was it silver?
Engraved?

25:21.821 --> 25:22.789
Any distinctive marks?

25:22.822 --> 25:24.290
It was wooden.

25:24.323 --> 25:26.659
Hand-crafted by one of
her great, great relatives.

25:26.693 --> 25:28.628
The family wanted it back,
but I couldn't find it.

25:28.661 --> 25:30.997
I just figured it was lost.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.899
We're gonna need you to give us
a detailed description.

25:32.932 --> 25:37.169
Will a photograph
of my son holding it do?

25:39.906 --> 25:41.574
[items being tossed around]

25:41.608 --> 25:44.310
(Judy)
Gentlemen, let's try not
to make a complete mess.

25:44.343 --> 25:46.245
Talented guy.

25:46.278 --> 25:48.080
What a waste.

25:48.114 --> 25:49.949
Find any baby items?
Nothing yet.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.217
Place is not that big, Judy.

25:51.250 --> 25:53.720
Well, we can always use
an extra pair of hands.

26:03.329 --> 26:05.297
Fin.

26:06.232 --> 26:08.267
[rattling]

26:10.970 --> 26:13.205
The good news is we found
the rattle hidden

26:13.239 --> 26:14.774
in one of Darius' sculptures.

26:14.807 --> 26:15.775
And the bad news?

26:15.808 --> 26:17.710
We took it to processing,
but after three years,

26:17.744 --> 26:19.679
the lab rats don't think
they can find any DNA

26:19.712 --> 26:21.247
of the Stansfield baby.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.448
Pick him up anyway.

26:22.481 --> 26:24.951
He'll just say he found it
or the victim gave it to him.

26:24.984 --> 26:26.185
You got a better idea?

26:26.218 --> 26:28.320
Well, Darius confessed
to my son.

26:28.354 --> 26:31.758
I think he's ripe to give it up
with a soft touch.

26:31.791 --> 26:34.593
What do you have in mind?

26:35.361 --> 26:37.063
Looks like you talked
to your mother.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.699
I won't help you put
my brother in prison.

26:39.732 --> 26:42.268
I'm only here to support Darius.

26:42.301 --> 26:45.004
Something he never got
from any of you.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.205
Terry's had it rough.

26:46.238 --> 26:47.907
Hey, don't defend her.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.877
Darius is her son
and she threw him away.

26:50.910 --> 26:52.044
Well, you took a big risk
protecting him.

26:52.078 --> 26:53.946
You should have come
to me first.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.381
I didn't trust you.

26:55.414 --> 26:58.184
For the longest time
he's all I had.

26:58.217 --> 27:01.053
No demands, no judgments.

27:01.087 --> 27:02.354
Especially when I came out.

27:02.388 --> 27:03.790
You weren't around.

27:03.823 --> 27:05.024
If you wanna support him,
that's fine.

27:05.057 --> 27:08.260
But, you need to remember he
killed a woman and took a child.

27:08.294 --> 27:11.363
And I need to know
where that baby is now.

27:15.868 --> 27:16.836
This your work?

27:16.869 --> 27:19.071
This yours?

27:21.708 --> 27:23.242
What do you want from me, man?

27:23.275 --> 27:25.011
I just want the truth.

27:25.044 --> 27:28.014
How long have you known
Terry was your mother?

27:28.047 --> 27:29.315
Too long.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.317
Grandma told me.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.319
When she was hopped up
on that morphine.

27:33.352 --> 27:37.223
And begging for forgiveness.

27:37.256 --> 27:38.925
Would have been better
if she took that secret

27:38.958 --> 27:39.959
to her grave.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.393
Darius, it's not your fault.

27:41.427 --> 27:45.231
Hey, tell me something, man!

27:45.264 --> 27:49.736
Why you and not me, huh?

27:49.769 --> 27:51.303
What's so damn special
about you?

27:51.337 --> 27:55.007
Nothing.

27:55.041 --> 27:56.809
Well, then I guess
it's not your fault either.

27:56.843 --> 27:58.110
Ken doesn't think
you meant to kill her.

27:58.144 --> 28:00.179
I knew you couldn't keep
your mouth shut.

28:00.212 --> 28:01.280
I didn't tell anyone!

28:01.313 --> 28:03.883
Don't sweat it.

28:03.916 --> 28:08.054
It's probably why I told you
in the first place.

28:08.087 --> 28:10.189
I got sober.

28:10.222 --> 28:13.960
I changed.

28:13.993 --> 28:18.397
I couldn't live with that guilt
not one more day of my life.

28:18.430 --> 28:20.166
I wanna believe that.

28:20.199 --> 28:22.068
You're very important to my son,

28:22.101 --> 28:24.003
but I won't help you
unless you come clean.

28:26.272 --> 28:27.940
What do you wanna know?

28:27.974 --> 28:29.508
Gotta take you down
to the precinct.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.243
I can't take your confession.

28:31.277 --> 28:32.444
Why not?

28:32.478 --> 28:35.247
'Cause you're my family.

28:37.416 --> 28:40.152
(Munch)
You understand your rights
as they've been read to you?

28:40.186 --> 28:41.453
It's not like I'm new to this.

28:41.487 --> 28:42.822
(Cragen)
Answer the question, Darius.

28:42.855 --> 28:44.056
I understood my rights
when I got pinched

28:44.090 --> 28:45.357
on that trumped-up
burglary charge,

28:45.391 --> 28:47.359
and I understand 'em now.

28:47.393 --> 28:49.395
Got a court date next week,

28:49.428 --> 28:50.930
but I guess
it doesn't matter.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.498
You ready?

28:52.531 --> 28:56.368
Let's do this.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.370
How did you know the victim,

28:58.404 --> 29:00.239
Nina Stansfield?

29:00.272 --> 29:02.274
I had a girl back then
used to baby-sit her kid.

29:02.308 --> 29:04.210
What's your girl's name?

29:04.243 --> 29:05.945
I don't want her
mixed up in this.

29:05.978 --> 29:07.546
We need to corroborate
your story.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.949
Then the body should be enough.

29:09.982 --> 29:11.517
I'll take you to 'em.

29:11.550 --> 29:16.288
You admit you killed
Nina Stansfield and her son.

29:19.058 --> 29:20.326
Look, I'm guilty of murder here,

29:20.359 --> 29:26.265
so I'm not going to make
any excuses, all right?

29:26.298 --> 29:28.367
I stabbed her with my knife.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.468
And then I killed her baby.

29:29.501 --> 29:31.070
(Cragen)
Why?

29:31.103 --> 29:35.074
He was just 14 months old,
he couldn't identify you.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.142
Whatever I tell you
is not gonna change the fact

29:36.175 --> 29:37.977
that he's still dead.

29:38.010 --> 29:41.113
So, let me get through this.

29:41.147 --> 29:44.283
I took their bodies
from the apartment.

29:44.316 --> 29:48.487
I put 'em in a car and drove 'em
to a vacant lot.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.923
Dug a hole and buried 'em.

29:50.957 --> 29:53.926
And that's where they've been
for the last three years.

29:59.932 --> 30:01.467
Should I write it down now?

30:11.443 --> 30:12.411
It's somewhere in here.

30:12.444 --> 30:14.413
I can't be sure, though.

30:14.446 --> 30:16.415
What made Ken go
to the other lot?

30:16.448 --> 30:18.384
After I told him what I did

30:18.417 --> 30:19.418
he started asking
a lot of questions

30:19.451 --> 30:21.053
I wasn't ready to answer.

30:21.087 --> 30:22.254
So you lied.

30:22.288 --> 30:25.157
Look, I'm already in cuffs.
You wanna make 'em tighter?

30:25.191 --> 30:25.992
Got something.

30:26.025 --> 30:27.193
About three feet down,
maybe less.

30:27.226 --> 30:28.327
So be careful.

30:31.230 --> 30:32.999
You did the right thing, Darius.

30:33.032 --> 30:34.566
Yeah.

30:34.600 --> 30:37.136
I'm going to prison
for the rest of my life.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.570
You came forward
of your own volition,

30:38.604 --> 30:40.907
you confessed to your crimes,
and you led us to the bodies.

30:40.940 --> 30:44.210
I think the ADA will take
that into consideration.

30:44.243 --> 30:45.644
Look, I'm not doing it
to get time saved,

30:45.677 --> 30:47.279
so don't speak up for me.

30:47.313 --> 30:49.548
No matter how much
my brother begs you.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.351
(Warner)
Okay, hold it.

30:52.384 --> 30:54.386
Hold it.

31:05.631 --> 31:09.902
Adult female, age 30,
presented with multiple cutting

31:09.936 --> 31:11.637
and stabbing wounds.

31:11.670 --> 31:14.974
There's advanced decomposition,
but I counted at least 15

31:15.007 --> 31:16.175
on the remaining tissue.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.644
Mostly defensive cuts
on her hands.

31:18.677 --> 31:21.948
There are also strike marks on
the radius, ribcage, and pelvis

31:21.981 --> 31:23.682
that match the murder weapon.

31:23.715 --> 31:26.018
Which means there had to be
a lot of force behind them.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.653
The best I can do without
intact organs on C.O.D.

31:27.686 --> 31:29.221
is exsanguination.

31:29.255 --> 31:30.589
What about the baby?

31:30.622 --> 31:31.623
Asphyxia by suffocation.

31:31.657 --> 31:33.092
Despite decomp,

31:33.125 --> 31:34.660
I found petechiae
in the vitreous fluid

31:34.693 --> 31:36.595
and soil in the lungs.

31:36.628 --> 31:40.066
The bastard buried
this baby alive.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.208
Heshy.

31:49.241 --> 31:50.242
How can I help you?

31:50.276 --> 31:52.078
I represent Darius Parker.

31:52.111 --> 31:53.079
Then I only have
one thing to say.

31:53.112 --> 31:54.113
No deal.

31:54.146 --> 31:55.414
I don't recall asking for one.

31:55.447 --> 31:58.050
Then what do you want?

31:58.084 --> 32:00.386
Well, a little pleasant
conversation wouldn't hurt.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.121
Okay.

32:02.154 --> 32:03.589
How's this?

32:03.622 --> 32:06.192
Your client viciously
stabbed a young mother.

32:06.225 --> 32:09.428
Then took the body and her
breathing, 14-month-old toddler

32:09.461 --> 32:10.562
from the apartment

32:10.596 --> 32:12.631
and buried the boy alive.

32:12.664 --> 32:14.466
I'm itching to put
a needle in his veins,

32:14.500 --> 32:16.735
but I'll settle for life,
no parole.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.670
What a moving speech.

32:18.704 --> 32:21.607
Too bad no one'll
get to hear it.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.275
Omnibus, Casey.

32:25.077 --> 32:29.415
In limine, motion to suppress,
motion to dismiss?

32:31.583 --> 32:34.086
(Judge Preston)
Okay, Counselors.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.321
You've got two minutes.

32:35.354 --> 32:37.123
My client's fifth and sixth
amendment rights were violated.

32:37.156 --> 32:38.724
The police interrogated him
without counsel.

32:38.757 --> 32:39.591
Did he ask for one?

32:39.625 --> 32:41.760
No, Darius Parker
was read his rights,

32:41.793 --> 32:43.695
then he signed
a Miranda card.

32:43.729 --> 32:45.031
Sounds pretty
straightforward to me.

32:45.064 --> 32:47.066
He told police
he had an open case.

32:47.099 --> 32:47.933
I'm the attorney of record.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.501
They conveniently
neglected to call me.

32:49.535 --> 32:50.769
Because no one had to.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.338
Texas vs. Cobb, Your Honor.

32:52.371 --> 32:55.107
The Supreme Court ruled that
suspects could be questioned

32:55.141 --> 32:57.243
on other charges regardless
of representation.

32:57.276 --> 32:59.345
In Cobb,
the defendant admitted

32:59.378 --> 33:01.413
he burglarized
the murder victim's home.

33:01.447 --> 33:02.714
No linkage, no case.

33:02.748 --> 33:05.651
Hmm. Walk with me.

33:05.684 --> 33:07.419
Darius Parker never asked
for an attorney.

33:07.453 --> 33:09.155
Will you stipulate
he informed police

33:09.188 --> 33:11.390
he had an outstanding burglary
charge and a court date?

33:11.423 --> 33:12.591
Yes.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.393
Then my client didn't
need to invoke.

33:14.426 --> 33:15.561
The right was implied.

33:15.594 --> 33:18.230
The police should've stopped
the interrogation and waited.

33:18.264 --> 33:19.498
It would've cost them
nothing but time.

33:19.531 --> 33:21.633
I have to agree
with Mr. Horowitz on this one.

33:21.667 --> 33:22.568
But, Your Honor--

33:22.601 --> 33:23.802
The police knew
the defendant had counsel

33:23.835 --> 33:26.072
and they ignored it.

33:26.105 --> 33:27.439
There's been a lot of that
going around lately

33:27.473 --> 33:29.341
and that disturbs me.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.043
The confession's out.

33:31.077 --> 33:34.413
And so are any fruits
borne from it.

33:34.446 --> 33:35.547
(Novak)
The judge threw
the confession out.

33:35.581 --> 33:36.748
And my case.

33:36.782 --> 33:39.218
How does a guy walk when he
confesses to a double homicide?

33:39.251 --> 33:41.653
As soon as the victims' bodies
became inadmissible.

33:41.687 --> 33:43.822
And since we can't put either
one of them back in the ground

33:43.855 --> 33:45.824
and start over,
I will never be able to prove

33:45.857 --> 33:48.294
that the baby's even dead
or how he got that way.

33:48.327 --> 33:51.063
Darius knew what he was doing.

33:51.097 --> 33:54.600
The confession, his remorse, the
taking us to the burial ground.

33:54.633 --> 33:55.601
You think it was a setup?

33:55.634 --> 33:56.735
I know it was.

33:56.768 --> 33:58.837
He was looking at five felony
counts on two murders.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.472
He let you know
he was on the docket

34:00.506 --> 34:01.473
so he wouldn't have to spend
a day inside.

34:01.507 --> 34:05.077
You think his attorney
told him what to say?

34:05.111 --> 34:08.080
No one would advise their client
to take that kind of risk.

34:08.114 --> 34:09.848
Besides, they're plenty of
ex-cons who know the law

34:09.881 --> 34:10.716
as well as I do.

34:10.749 --> 34:12.584
There's a lot of law books
in prison.

34:12.618 --> 34:14.153
I can still prove

34:14.186 --> 34:15.454
Nina Stansfield was murdered
without her body

34:15.487 --> 34:17.623
from the blood volume
at the crime scene.

34:17.656 --> 34:19.291
But without the confession
we're back to square one.

34:19.325 --> 34:20.559
Like, it just happened.

34:20.592 --> 34:22.561
So canvass the neighbors,
talk to the family,

34:22.594 --> 34:24.296
dig into the victim's life.

34:24.330 --> 34:25.464
What about his girlfriend?

34:25.497 --> 34:27.466
She used to baby-sit
for the Stansfields.

34:27.499 --> 34:31.170
We can't use anything the
suspect said in the confession.

34:31.203 --> 34:33.172
Then we get the information
through another channel.

34:33.205 --> 34:34.140
You're thinking of your son?

34:34.173 --> 34:35.774
Aren't you?

34:35.807 --> 34:36.875
(Novak)
Well, there's nothing
precluding us

34:36.908 --> 34:38.544
from going back
to the original source.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.146
They've always been close.

34:40.179 --> 34:43.115
Ken'll be able to tell us
who Darius was seeing.

34:45.717 --> 34:47.419
(Ken)
Can't do it.

34:47.453 --> 34:48.687
He belongs in prison, Ken.

34:48.720 --> 34:50.489
Haven't we done enough
to him already

34:50.522 --> 34:52.624
without me putting
the nail in his coffin?

34:52.658 --> 34:55.127
Don't you get it?
He sold you on a lie.

34:55.161 --> 34:56.828
He's only looking
at one count of murder now.

34:56.862 --> 34:59.565
He'll never pay for putting
that little baby in the ground.

34:59.598 --> 35:00.866
Why not?

35:00.899 --> 35:02.901
The courts say
we got his confession

35:02.934 --> 35:04.170
and the bodies illegally.

35:04.203 --> 35:05.904
That means we can't
use it at trial.

35:05.937 --> 35:08.474
We gotta say the murder victim's
son came up missing

35:08.507 --> 35:09.908
the same time she did.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.877
We gotta act
like we don't know he's dead

35:11.910 --> 35:13.879
because we can't use
his body as evidence.

35:13.912 --> 35:14.813
That's not right.

35:14.846 --> 35:16.415
Yeah, well, that's the law.

35:16.448 --> 35:18.350
Do you know why he killed her?

35:20.219 --> 35:22.521
Look, I know you want to blame
this on your mother,

35:22.554 --> 35:25.357
and she does have
a lot to answer for.

35:25.391 --> 35:27.393
But, she did not stab
that woman to death

35:27.426 --> 35:29.261
and put her baby
in a makeshift grave.

35:29.295 --> 35:31.129
That's all on Darius.

35:32.231 --> 35:34.400
What do you wanna know?

35:34.433 --> 35:35.534
You ever meet any of Darius'
girlfriends?

35:35.567 --> 35:37.603
Yes.

35:37.636 --> 35:39.838
This is a list
of the Stansfield babysitters.

35:39.871 --> 35:42.308
You recognize
any of the names?

35:45.411 --> 35:48.414
Angela Boden.

35:48.447 --> 35:50.549
She was crazy about Darius.

35:50.582 --> 35:54.386
Bought him gifts.
Gave him money.

35:54.420 --> 35:58.757
He wasn't really into her but he
liked the way she treated him.

35:58.790 --> 35:59.758
Shame about what happened.

35:59.791 --> 36:00.959
Little Stevie was cute.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.461
Good baby.
Hardly ever cried.

36:02.494 --> 36:03.795
How long did you baby-sit him?

36:03.829 --> 36:05.797
About six months.
I couldn't stand his mother.

36:05.831 --> 36:06.865
Why is that?

36:06.898 --> 36:08.800
Nina was stepping out
on her old man,

36:08.834 --> 36:10.902
but always in my ass
about using the phone,

36:10.936 --> 36:13.372
and how much food I ate,
and who I let in the house.

36:13.405 --> 36:14.873
Old bitch.

36:14.906 --> 36:17.809
I guess I shouldn't
speak ill of the dead.

36:17.843 --> 36:19.845
We understand she had a problem
with your boyfriend.

36:19.878 --> 36:22.314
It's not like she was totally
in the wrong.

36:22.348 --> 36:24.583
Darius did have a temper.

36:24.616 --> 36:25.751
And he got me fired.

36:25.784 --> 36:26.818
How'd that happen?

36:26.852 --> 36:28.820
I used to tell him how she was.

36:28.854 --> 36:31.857
Always going out and not
spending time with the baby.

36:31.890 --> 36:34.926
He saw her out on the street
once, called her a bad mother.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.529
After that
I couldn't have him over.

36:37.563 --> 36:38.930
But, you did anyway.
He was my boyfriend.

36:38.964 --> 36:40.399
I wanted to see him.

36:40.432 --> 36:42.234
(Fin)
She catch you?
No.

36:42.268 --> 36:43.969
She found his knife
in the sofa cushions.

36:44.002 --> 36:45.271
Fired me on the spot.

36:45.304 --> 36:46.838
Told me Darius wasn't
getting it back.

36:46.872 --> 36:49.975
He carried a knife?

36:50.008 --> 36:51.643
It wasn't like how
you're making it sound.

36:51.677 --> 36:52.744
He's an artist.

36:52.778 --> 36:54.880
It was a gift
from me for sculpting.

36:54.913 --> 36:56.114
Cost me 100 bucks.

36:56.147 --> 36:58.817
You know how long I had to work
to save that kind of money?

36:58.850 --> 37:01.019
How did Darius react when he
found out his knife was history?

37:01.052 --> 37:02.120
How do you think?

37:02.153 --> 37:05.491
He went back to get it,
but I guess he was too late.

37:05.524 --> 37:06.992
It's kind of ironic.

37:07.025 --> 37:08.894
If she hadn't kept his property,

37:08.927 --> 37:10.996
her husband wouldn't
have used it to kill her.

37:13.365 --> 37:14.600
(Munch)
We got a signed statement
from the girlfriend.

37:14.633 --> 37:15.867
A history of conflict

37:15.901 --> 37:17.369
between the victim
and the suspect

37:17.403 --> 37:18.870
and ownership
of the murder weapon.

37:18.904 --> 37:21.873
Add that to his DNA at
the crime scene and he's done.

37:21.907 --> 37:23.942
Why didn't the cops question
this witness more thoroughly?

37:23.975 --> 37:25.010
Tunnel vision.

37:25.043 --> 37:26.712
They liked the husband for it
and wouldn't move on.

37:26.745 --> 37:28.714
Happens, Casey.

37:28.747 --> 37:31.350
You have enough to indict,
but can we get him on the baby?

37:31.383 --> 37:32.351
Not unless
I can get him to admit it

37:32.384 --> 37:33.419
with his counsel present.

37:33.452 --> 37:34.420
And for that to happen,

37:34.453 --> 37:35.687
you'd have to make him a deal.

37:35.721 --> 37:37.723
It would have to be considerable
time shaved for him to agree.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.558
And I'm not comfortable
doing that.

37:39.591 --> 37:42.594
Even if it means the baby's
death goes unacknowledged?

37:42.628 --> 37:45.764
And unavenged?

37:45.797 --> 37:46.998
With the compelling
physical evidence,

37:47.032 --> 37:49.034
the witness testimony,

37:49.067 --> 37:50.736
the Stansfield baby,

37:50.769 --> 37:54.540
your client is going to prison
for a very long time.

37:54.573 --> 37:56.007
Don't look so happy.

37:56.041 --> 37:58.510
Hubris isn't attractive.

37:58.544 --> 38:00.512
Especially in women your age.

38:00.546 --> 38:01.813
(Horowitz)
Darius, let me handle it.

38:01.847 --> 38:03.582
(Darius)
Handle what?

38:03.615 --> 38:05.584
She can't mention the baby.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.886
It's fruit
from the poisonous tree.

38:07.919 --> 38:09.455
(Novak)
I don't need to.

38:09.488 --> 38:11.022
All a jury needs to hear
is that a child disappeared

38:11.056 --> 38:12.858
when his mother was killed.

38:12.891 --> 38:14.793
They'll put it together
themselves.

38:14.826 --> 38:15.794
It's doesn't matter.

38:15.827 --> 38:18.997
You can't bring charges
against me for the kid.

38:19.030 --> 38:20.899
It hurts, doesn't it?

38:20.932 --> 38:22.568
Not as much as you'd like.

38:22.601 --> 38:24.570
You're gonna get the maximum

38:24.603 --> 38:26.738
on all three charges
that you're facing.

38:26.772 --> 38:28.440
I'm thinking
life for the murder.

38:28.474 --> 38:29.608
Another 30 for the attempt

38:29.641 --> 38:30.609
and the assault--

38:30.642 --> 38:32.544
I smell a horse trade.

38:32.578 --> 38:34.846
I'm reluctant, but I'm willing
to recommend 30 years total

38:34.880 --> 38:38.417
if your client recounts
everything at allocution.

38:38.450 --> 38:40.652
You can't prove intent.

38:40.686 --> 38:42.053
Give us 25 years with
a possibility of parole

38:42.087 --> 38:43.389
and we might have something
to talk about.

38:43.422 --> 38:45.691
No.
We won't.

38:45.724 --> 38:48.594
This is my final offer.

38:50.562 --> 38:51.963
We need the room.

38:51.997 --> 38:53.799
(Darius)
Nobody's going anywhere.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.501
I'm not making any deals.

38:55.534 --> 38:57.936
I want my day in court.

38:57.969 --> 38:59.538
Listen to your mouthpiece
and take the damn offer.

38:59.571 --> 39:00.439
Go to hell!

39:00.472 --> 39:02.641
Kiss my ass
and while you down there,

39:02.674 --> 39:04.910
spread 'em
'cause you about to get done!

39:04.943 --> 39:07.646
This is about the family.

39:07.679 --> 39:09.448
You damn right
it's about the family.

39:09.481 --> 39:12.751
Every last one of you is gonna
have to be in that courtroom.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.686
You're gonna have to testify.

39:14.720 --> 39:18.857
Your lives out in the open
for everyone to judge.

39:18.890 --> 39:22.594
Same way y'all been doing
to me since day one.

39:22.628 --> 39:25.431
They gonna know
what kind of cop you are,

39:25.464 --> 39:27.966
and what kind of husband
and father you weren't.

39:27.999 --> 39:32.771
They gonna know all about
my brother's sexual habits

39:32.804 --> 39:33.972
and his collusion.

39:34.005 --> 39:36.842
And I guarantee
once that comes out,

39:36.875 --> 39:40.479
everybody's gonna wonder why
he's not being charged too.

39:40.512 --> 39:43.114
They gonna think
his cop father

39:43.148 --> 39:47.185
has friends
in your office, Ms. Novak.

39:47.218 --> 39:50.822
And I hope you have
a damn good explanation.

39:50.856 --> 39:55.594
'Cause cover-up makes
for a nice headline.

39:55.627 --> 39:59.064
Never mind
a no-good mother is dead.

39:59.097 --> 40:01.733
And her poor baby is missing.

40:01.767 --> 40:03.435
Even though
the baby's better off.

40:03.469 --> 40:05.671
So, yeah,
I'm going to prison.

40:05.704 --> 40:10.709
But not for as long
as you think.

40:10.742 --> 40:15.681
'Cause once Theresa Randall
takes that stand...

40:15.714 --> 40:20.519
and has to tell the truth...

40:20.552 --> 40:22.621
that festering bitch
is gonna have to claim me

40:22.654 --> 40:26.658
for the first time
in her miserable life.

40:26.692 --> 40:29.027
And let's see her shake me
after that.

40:31.597 --> 40:32.898
So you wanna bury me?

40:32.931 --> 40:36.201
You go right ahead.

40:36.234 --> 40:40.772
'Cause I'm taking you all
down with me when you do.

40:53.151 --> 40:54.553
(Fin)
What are you doing here?

40:54.586 --> 40:56.054
I came to see what I could do.

40:59.891 --> 41:02.160
Darius--

41:14.640 --> 41:16.141
