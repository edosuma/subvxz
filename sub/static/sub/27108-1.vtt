WEBVTT

00:09.844 --> 00:11.543
For as long as I can remember,

00:11.579 --> 00:13.979
each Christmas season
absolutely had to begin

00:14.015 --> 00:16.280
with a short drive to Chicago

00:16.317 --> 00:18.584
to visit the Christmas
displays downtown.

00:21.889 --> 00:24.056
To search for gifts
for everyone we love,

00:26.027 --> 00:28.527
alongside crowds of
others searching for gifts

00:28.562 --> 00:29.862
for everyone they love.

00:33.134 --> 00:36.769
But one year, the most
amazing gift imaginable

00:36.804 --> 00:38.704
came from a complete stranger.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

01:01.429 --> 01:03.162
- This branch.
- You good?

01:03.230 --> 01:05.063
Yeah, yeah, good to go.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.698
And, all right, up, up, up.

01:06.734 --> 01:07.866
Yep, yep, yep.

01:07.902 --> 01:08.942
- Steady, steady.
- Got it?

01:10.404 --> 01:12.504
One down, many more to go.

01:13.774 --> 01:14.640
I'll say, I'm impressed, Chris.

01:14.675 --> 01:15.952
It's your first Christmas season

01:15.976 --> 01:17.287
and you barely got
needles or sap on you.

01:17.311 --> 01:19.071
I think you're gonna
work out just fine here.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.415
Duty calls.

01:23.484 --> 01:24.484
Boy.

01:27.054 --> 01:28.087
Whoa, hey, sir, sir, sir.

01:28.155 --> 01:29.655
I think, this year, I talked to Dad,

01:29.690 --> 01:31.990
and the blue spruce
would be really lovely.

01:32.059 --> 01:33.103
To put it up in the...

01:33.127 --> 01:34.726
There we go.

01:34.762 --> 01:35.994
Okay.

01:36.030 --> 01:37.140
- Good morning.
- Hello, Heather.

01:37.164 --> 01:38.397
Heather's got her notebook.

01:38.466 --> 01:39.331
You know what that means.

01:39.366 --> 01:40.866
December has sprung

01:40.935 --> 01:43.969
which means the Krueger
family tree hunt has begun.

01:44.004 --> 01:45.838
Are we looking for the
house or for the cabin?

01:45.873 --> 01:48.040
Both, cabin and house.

01:48.075 --> 01:49.174
Good.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.742
I've got my notebook, measuring tape,

01:50.778 --> 01:53.212
and we are gonna find the
most Christmassy Christmas tree

01:53.247 --> 01:54.346
in this garden center.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.849
She takes a lot of notes.

02:00.154 --> 02:01.420
- Thank you.
- Sure.

02:02.857 --> 02:03.857
What unit, sir?

02:05.659 --> 02:07.860
Second Marine Division, '71 to '76.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.131
Just discharged myself.

02:12.166 --> 02:13.065
This year.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.333
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:14.401 --> 02:15.745
My first Christmas back in five years.

02:15.769 --> 02:16.869
Welcome back.

02:20.541 --> 02:24.143
Now, this is a tree.

02:24.178 --> 02:25.811
I'm afraid that one's taken.

02:25.846 --> 02:26.645
What?

02:26.680 --> 02:27.913
Already?

02:27.948 --> 02:29.781
Sorry, you should have
made a reservation.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.384
So, did we discuss the
cousin discount this year?

02:32.419 --> 02:35.154
We did not, and I don't
think that's a real thing.

02:35.189 --> 02:38.323
Unless we're talking about
wholesale plus 10%, then.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.325
I gotta help a customer, tree is yours.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.530
Hey, psst.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.265
Isn't that that guy from your class?

02:46.333 --> 02:47.933
Yeah, it totally is.

02:48.002 --> 02:49.835
Yeah, that's Andy.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.471
Did he ask you out yet?

02:52.506 --> 02:55.274
We're supposed to be
going out later this week.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.976
Is he that boring?

02:58.045 --> 03:01.914
No, sorry, I've just been exhausted.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.549
You seem really tired lately.

03:03.584 --> 03:04.584
Are you okay?

03:05.486 --> 03:08.020
Yeah, just been studying.

03:08.088 --> 03:10.389
Heather, look at that one.

03:14.795 --> 03:17.863
Right.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.798
Heather, the lounge looks amazing.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.100
Hello, everybody, hello.

03:22.136 --> 03:23.136
Hey, shh.

03:23.904 --> 03:26.271
What a lively bunch.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.906
I can tell you're all gonna be nurses.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.587
First of all, I'd just first like to say

03:30.611 --> 03:32.177
a quick but a heartfelt thank you

03:32.213 --> 03:35.647
to first year grad
student Heather Krueger.

03:35.683 --> 03:38.116
- Yes.
- For these festive wreaths

03:38.152 --> 03:39.885
and decorations, it's beautiful.

03:41.522 --> 03:42.454
And I'd just like to give you

03:42.523 --> 03:44.356
a quick reminder that our annual

03:44.391 --> 03:46.692
ugly Christmas sweater
party is coming up.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.126
- How exciting.
- I'm gonna win.

03:48.162 --> 03:51.330
After exams, unfortunately.

03:51.365 --> 03:52.542
So for now, what do you say we begin

03:52.566 --> 03:54.166
our Secret Santa gift
exchange, shall we?

03:54.235 --> 03:56.134
Yes.

03:56.203 --> 03:59.338
Hey, would you, would you
mind grabbing my, my gift?

03:59.373 --> 04:03.108
I think, I might call it an early night.

04:03.143 --> 04:03.875
What?

04:03.944 --> 04:04.944
It's 5:00.

04:06.146 --> 04:07.624
I might have to call
that a pathetic night.

04:07.648 --> 04:10.082
I'm just, I'm not
feeling very well lately.

04:10.117 --> 04:11.550
Heather, are you okay?

04:21.462 --> 04:23.128
Heather, remember your promise?

04:23.163 --> 04:24.896
- Mom...
- You've been feeling

04:24.932 --> 04:26.164
like this for a while now.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.467
I know, but...

04:28.502 --> 04:29.980
You promised if you felt this way again,

04:30.004 --> 04:32.271
you'd go to the hospital
and get checked out.

04:36.143 --> 04:39.745
I will, after exams.

04:48.756 --> 04:49.916
We're going in the morning.

04:55.529 --> 04:56.529
Okay.

04:59.333 --> 05:00.699
It'll be okay.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.842
Lot of business today, that's good.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.438
It bodes well for the rest of December.

05:13.447 --> 05:14.447
Yeah.

05:15.482 --> 05:16.915
Why are you so happy?

05:16.950 --> 05:18.784
Christmas season's just started.

05:18.819 --> 05:19.918
Hey, check this out.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.520
I'm applying for a job.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.034
What, is this place
not good enough for you?

05:24.058 --> 05:27.192
No, no, no, it's, for
after the season's over.

05:27.227 --> 05:29.161
This is Hands and Hearts Abroad.

05:29.196 --> 05:30.696
What would you be doing for them?

05:30.764 --> 05:33.065
Well, you know, doing what they do.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.233
Rebuilding villages and communities

05:35.269 --> 05:37.836
affected by natural
disasters, that sort of thing.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.237
I think it's great,

05:39.273 --> 05:40.138
but you just got back to Frankfort,

05:40.174 --> 05:41.640
you're gonna leave so soon?

05:42.543 --> 05:44.209
Yeah, yeah, maybe.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.144
Quite the adventurer.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.813
You never stay put.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.281
First the Marines and now this.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.028
I guess I'm just still
trying to figure out

05:52.052 --> 05:53.685
what I'm gonna with my life, you know?

05:54.822 --> 05:55.822
Yeah, I hear ya.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.590
I just wanna get out there.

05:59.827 --> 06:02.094
Try making a difference
in the world, you know?

06:04.465 --> 06:06.698
Sometimes you don't
have to travel the world

06:06.734 --> 06:07.833
to make a difference.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.256
Hey, kiddo.

06:31.291 --> 06:32.291
Hey, Dad.

06:33.293 --> 06:35.060
How did everything go at the hospital?

06:35.095 --> 06:36.328
They poked and prodded,

06:36.363 --> 06:37.496
ran their tests.

06:37.531 --> 06:39.531
Doctors and nurses, you know?

06:39.566 --> 06:42.234
She said it was excellent
training for her degree.

06:42.269 --> 06:44.436
Everything's a learning experience.

06:44.471 --> 06:47.205
The test results should come
back in a couple of days.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.008
So, how goes wreath making?

06:50.911 --> 06:52.177
It's going.

06:52.212 --> 06:53.278
Well, it's looking good.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.285
Something's up, what's going on?

07:02.756 --> 07:05.157
Okay, we were thinking,

07:05.192 --> 07:07.893
and we don't wanna be
Grinches about this,

07:07.961 --> 07:10.128
but we maybe we should take it easy

07:10.164 --> 07:12.998
on the usual Christmas celebrations

07:13.066 --> 07:15.033
and traditions this year.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.935
Just until you get
your test results back.

07:17.004 --> 07:17.869
Then we can talk about...

07:17.905 --> 07:19.404
Not a chance.

07:19.473 --> 07:20.683
I'm just finishing
the front door wreath,

07:20.707 --> 07:21.985
and when was the last time we skipped

07:22.009 --> 07:24.075
the Krueger family cookie exchange?

07:24.111 --> 07:26.778
19, never.

07:26.814 --> 07:27.913
Exactly.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.247
Okay, just checking.

07:29.283 --> 07:30.782
- We tried.
- Yup.

07:33.053 --> 07:36.988
It's a tradition for a
reason, and a Kruger tradition.

07:54.475 --> 07:55.907
Can I help you?

07:55.943 --> 07:56.808
Yeah, I'm Chris Dempsey, I
have a two o'clock interview

07:56.877 --> 07:57.742
with Mr. Spry?

07:57.778 --> 07:59.411
Yes, of course, I'm Heidi.

07:59.446 --> 08:01.480
Hi, Heidi, nice to meet you.

08:01.515 --> 08:02.525
He should be with you
shortly, he's running a little

08:02.549 --> 08:05.283
- behind today.
- No problem, thank you.

08:05.319 --> 08:06.319
There you go.

08:06.353 --> 08:08.286
So, do you like to travel?

08:08.322 --> 08:09.322
Yes, very much.

08:09.389 --> 08:10.155
Well, have a seat.

08:10.224 --> 08:11.224
Sure.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.206
This is delicious, ma, I gotta say.

08:16.230 --> 08:18.530
Just a little something I whipped up.

08:18.565 --> 08:21.266
This from the famous
Judy book of recipes?

08:21.301 --> 08:22.968
Actually, no.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.636
I've stepped up my game this year.

08:24.705 --> 08:27.239
I've been sharing more
recipes online and I'm getting

08:27.274 --> 08:30.809
some great ones in return
from as far as Fiji.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.677
Impressive.

08:32.712 --> 08:35.514
Just a little preview of
all the recipes I wanna make

08:35.582 --> 08:36.780
this year for Christmas.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.616
Ma, you don't have to do all that.

08:38.652 --> 08:41.019
I am so excited, honey,
my baby boy is home

08:41.054 --> 08:42.520
for the holidays.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.523
All right, all right.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.494
Our first Christmas together in years.

08:49.530 --> 08:50.530
Yeah.

08:54.902 --> 08:58.103
So you remember my hairdresser Brenda?

08:58.171 --> 08:59.571
Ma...

08:59.640 --> 09:00.972
Her daughter Sadie.

09:01.008 --> 09:03.008
How many times do I have
to tell you, I love you

09:03.043 --> 09:05.610
- but enough with the fix...
- She's very nice,

09:05.646 --> 09:07.646
and it's already done,
dinner tomorrow night

09:07.714 --> 09:09.047
at Stanton's Restaurant.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.082
You're free, right?

09:13.353 --> 09:14.353
Sure.

09:18.158 --> 09:21.226
So, after the Marines, I traveled a bit.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.261
Wasn't really sure
what I wanted to do, so.

09:23.297 --> 09:25.263
Sorry, I just.

09:25.332 --> 09:26.398
Yeah, yeah.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.805
And anatomy class was such
a piece of cake for me.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.107
Did I mention I have
a photographic memory?

09:36.143 --> 09:38.276
No, Andy, I didn't know that about you.

09:38.345 --> 09:41.179
It's a blessing and a
curse, let me tell you.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.981
And I ride a motorcycle.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.351
Not in the winter of course.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.285
Too cold.

09:50.324 --> 09:52.057
You know, what about you, do you travel.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.892
Sorry, just one...

09:55.162 --> 09:57.062
What do you think of
the decor in this place?

09:57.130 --> 10:00.098
Kind of overdo it on
Christmas, don't you think?

10:01.101 --> 10:03.501
I don't think you can overdo Christmas.

10:05.639 --> 10:08.106
You know, I'm gonna get an eggnog.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.910
I can serve it to...

10:11.945 --> 10:12.945
I'll be right back.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.718
Well, I'm just gonna pop
over to the bar and...

10:29.763 --> 10:30.763
Thank you.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.667
Looks like some of
the decor fell on you.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.503
What's that?

10:38.538 --> 10:41.706
I said it looks like some
of the decor fell on you.

10:43.910 --> 10:48.146
The sweater, snowflakes, good joke.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.215
No, it was a terrible joke.

10:51.985 --> 10:52.985
Yeah, it was.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.221
But you know, 'tis the season.

10:56.289 --> 10:57.455
What's that?

10:57.491 --> 10:59.924
I said 'tis the season.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.593
Yes.

11:04.398 --> 11:06.164
Let me guess.

11:06.199 --> 11:06.931
Eggnog.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.366
Right.

11:08.402 --> 11:09.402
Guilty as charged.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.604
If I could just...

11:16.243 --> 11:18.910
Boy, it's really hard to
get a drink in this place.

11:18.945 --> 11:21.546
I think it's all about the timing.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.482
Yes, I think you're right.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.018
Anyway, I should...

11:27.954 --> 11:29.287
Yeah, yeah.

11:29.322 --> 11:30.322
Merry Christmas.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.024
Merry Christmas!

11:33.427 --> 11:34.427
Sir, if...

11:53.680 --> 11:55.947
Good morning, I'm Dr.
Jenkins, this is my colleague...

11:55.982 --> 11:57.582
- Rosa Fernandez.
- Morning.

11:57.617 --> 11:58.650
Good morning.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.796
Heather...

12:11.832 --> 12:14.632
Our test results show that
you have an autoimmune disease

12:14.701 --> 12:16.434
known as AIH.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.743
It occurs when the body's own
immune system turns against

12:18.805 --> 12:19.971
the cells that are found...

12:20.006 --> 12:21.006
In the liver.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.410
Yes, that's right.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.112
She's a nursing student.

12:27.147 --> 12:31.316
Yeah, well then, you may
also be aware that often

12:31.351 --> 12:32.717
the cause is unknown.

12:34.187 --> 12:37.956
Unfortunately, Heather, the
disease is in an advanced stage.

12:37.991 --> 12:40.792
It's been doing damage to
your liver for quite some time.

12:42.763 --> 12:46.631
So what are our treatment
options, what medications

12:46.666 --> 12:47.732
should I be starting?

12:51.972 --> 12:54.239
I'm the clinic's transplant coordinator.

12:55.408 --> 12:56.908
Transplant coordinator?

12:58.879 --> 13:00.656
Heather, there's no other
way to say this, but you're

13:00.680 --> 13:04.115
going to need a liver
transplant as soon as possible.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.787
How soon are we talking?

13:08.822 --> 13:10.922
You have stage four liver disease.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.759
Stage four, what does that mean?

13:15.862 --> 13:16.862
It means soon, mom.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.643
We'll get your name on the
waiting list right away,

13:20.667 --> 13:23.601
but that can take time
for the right match

13:23.637 --> 13:24.637
to become available.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.106
There are a lot of factors to become...

13:43.824 --> 13:46.124
We'd like to discuss
another option with you.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.896
What's that?

13:51.932 --> 13:53.131
Find a living donor.

13:55.735 --> 13:57.001
A living donor?

13:57.037 --> 13:59.571
It's a lot to ask of someone, right?

13:59.639 --> 14:01.372
To give up a part of themselves?

14:01.441 --> 14:03.241
Someone donates half of their liver...

14:03.276 --> 14:04.642
Because the liver regenerates.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.544
But it will save you, right?

14:08.014 --> 14:09.113
Yes?

14:09.182 --> 14:11.883
But it has to be the perfect match.

14:11.918 --> 14:15.320
The blood type, the age
of the donor, the health

14:15.355 --> 14:18.289
of the donor, there's a lot of factors.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.925
Okay, so just back up,
then after you met with

14:20.961 --> 14:23.862
the doctor, you met with a financial...

14:23.897 --> 14:27.966
Officer to discuss options
of how we're gonna pay

14:28.001 --> 14:32.337
for all of it, just been really...

14:33.940 --> 14:34.940
Hey.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.443
You're gonna get through this.

14:38.511 --> 14:41.713
I'm gonna get screened and
you are gonna find your match.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.751
Gonna find my match, you're right.

14:47.821 --> 14:49.754
It's all gonna work out.

14:54.361 --> 14:55.627
We have to get the word out.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.662
We need to go wide as fast as we can.

14:57.697 --> 14:58.963
I don't know.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.543
Heather, you need a
donor as soon as possible.

15:00.567 --> 15:01.966
We can start an email.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.234
I can make phone calls.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.513
I'll get a social media campaign going.

15:04.537 --> 15:05.436
Yeah!

15:05.472 --> 15:07.038
I just don't know about this.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.985
It's the Christmas season,
I don't want to be a burden,

15:09.009 --> 15:11.209
everybody is busy with their own lives.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.378
But that's what the
Christmas season is all about.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.446
I mean, people in this
community care about you,

15:15.482 --> 15:16.447
they'll wanna help.

15:16.483 --> 15:17.982
Sweetheart.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.784
You can't do this on your own.

15:19.853 --> 15:22.153
I know you hate to ask for
help, you've always been

15:22.188 --> 15:23.755
that way, but the more people who

15:23.823 --> 15:25.189
know about this, the better.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.227
But it's not just about
finding a match, is it?

15:30.630 --> 15:32.697
What happens when we find one?

15:32.732 --> 15:33.732
What do you mean?

15:35.168 --> 15:37.128
They actually have to go
through with it, right?

15:38.305 --> 15:39.305
Right?

15:42.142 --> 15:43.441
It's a lot to ask of someone.

15:47.047 --> 15:49.681
Wouldn't you do it for
someone else if you could?

15:57.757 --> 15:58.757
Of course.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.064
Yeah.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.835
But the first step is finding someone.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.771
I know, but nobody...

16:13.807 --> 16:16.107
Heather, we need to find
a match, you're my sister

16:16.142 --> 16:18.743
and I love you but
there's no debate here.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.847
People always talk about
miracles at Christmas, right?

16:23.783 --> 16:26.184
Well, here we are, you need one.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.429
Let me get the word out.

16:43.803 --> 16:46.204
- Okay, let's do this.
- Yes!

16:47.240 --> 16:52.176
Okay.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.124
Have one, 'cause I'll just eat them all.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.525
I'm good.

17:07.594 --> 17:10.994
Well, thanks anyway, Marjory,
we appreciate it anyway.

17:11.064 --> 17:12.230
You have a merry Christmas.

17:16.869 --> 17:19.604
Your dad is at the printer's
and he's put a small

17:19.638 --> 17:22.073
team together and they
say they're going to paper

17:22.108 --> 17:24.008
the entire Midwest.

17:24.077 --> 17:25.643
They probably will, too.

17:26.980 --> 17:28.057
- Looks great.
- Yeah, that's why

17:28.080 --> 17:29.914
I added this at the bottom.

18:05.652 --> 18:08.086
My page has over a thousand
hits and still not a single

18:08.121 --> 18:09.253
potential...

18:10.723 --> 18:12.890
There's so many factors.

18:12.926 --> 18:15.660
I'm sorry honey, you were
doing so much, don't worry.

18:16.863 --> 18:19.163
It's just, I feel like I could do more.

18:23.203 --> 18:27.805
Do you know, if I had the
same blood type, I would.

18:27.841 --> 18:28.841
We know.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.411
I'm turning in, good night.

18:39.085 --> 18:40.384
Love you.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.153
- Love you.
- Hang in there, honey.

18:45.959 --> 18:46.991
Look at this.

18:48.294 --> 18:50.161
Less than five percent of transplants

18:50.230 --> 18:51.796
come from living donors.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.265
Less than five percent.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.468
It's just so hard.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.015
Well, what about your
cousin Russell's daughter

19:00.039 --> 19:01.772
Tara in Iowa City?

19:01.808 --> 19:03.385
I know they still have
to run some more tests...

19:03.409 --> 19:04.409
Not a match.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.611
What?

19:06.646 --> 19:08.579
Russell called earlier,
I wanted to tell you,

19:08.615 --> 19:10.581
but I didn't want to disappoint Heather.

19:13.219 --> 19:14.452
I'm really scared, Cat.

19:15.588 --> 19:16.754
Don't be scared, dad.

19:19.325 --> 19:20.325
You're up.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.332
We'll find somebody
else, someone's out there.

19:30.036 --> 19:31.413
I don't know how you do it, kiddo.

19:31.437 --> 19:32.470
Do what?

19:33.373 --> 19:34.539
Stay so positive.

19:38.244 --> 19:40.011
I don't have any other choice.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.033
Here comes trouble.

20:02.068 --> 20:04.235
Don't worry, nothing
demanding, hot chocolate

20:04.270 --> 20:06.504
- from Sugar and Spice.
- Thank you.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.739
Just here for some supplies
for Heather's famous...

20:08.808 --> 20:10.841
- Christmas wreaths.
- Yes.

20:10.877 --> 20:11.921
And wondering if you're coming

20:11.945 --> 20:13.578
to the annual cookie exchange.

20:13.613 --> 20:14.912
I didn't hear back from you yet.

20:14.948 --> 20:16.559
I'm sorry, I didn't
think that was still on.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.882
No, we're doing it.

20:17.917 --> 20:20.751
Heather really wants
these Christmas traditions.

20:20.820 --> 20:21.820
Now more than ever.

20:23.356 --> 20:24.455
So how's she doing?

20:25.692 --> 20:28.125
Honestly, not great.

20:28.161 --> 20:30.695
We're all just really scared.

20:30.730 --> 20:31.730
So nothing yet?

20:32.732 --> 20:35.566
No, and she needs a
transplant really soon.

20:38.438 --> 20:41.072
There's a match out there
somewhere, there has to be.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.184
Okay dad, to the left.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.287
Okay, now a little to the right.

20:58.024 --> 21:00.558
- Clockwise, no counter, okay.
- That way?

21:00.593 --> 21:03.628
No, the other clockwise, a little bit.

21:03.663 --> 21:04.395
Heather!

21:04.430 --> 21:05.430
Perfect.

21:07.066 --> 21:08.666
If you're gonna do a job right, then...

21:08.701 --> 21:12.937
Do it all the way, where
have I heard that before, huh?

21:12.972 --> 21:14.939
A wise man told me a long time ago.

21:14.974 --> 21:17.208
He was very wise, wasn't he?

21:17.243 --> 21:18.876
He still is.

21:18.911 --> 21:19.844
You really did a wonderful
job picking out the tree

21:19.879 --> 21:21.579
this year, sweetheart.

21:21.648 --> 21:22.648
Thank you.

21:24.951 --> 21:25.951
Okay.

21:28.921 --> 21:29.954
What is it?

21:32.191 --> 21:33.924
I want this year to be perfect.

21:35.094 --> 21:36.861
All of our Christmas traditions.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.297
The cookie exchange,
Christmas dinner at the cabin.

21:39.332 --> 21:40.332
Your favorite.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.634
I wanna tell you guys something.

21:43.703 --> 21:45.936
I've already talked
to Ash about it and...

21:47.607 --> 21:50.374
I think I'm gonna take
some time away from school.

21:52.545 --> 21:53.778
Indefinitely, I guess.

21:58.951 --> 22:01.085
But I don't wanna miss
any of our traditions

22:01.120 --> 22:03.421
and I would love to go
to the nursing school's

22:03.489 --> 22:05.356
annual ugly Christmas sweater party.

22:05.391 --> 22:07.458
Well, there's certainly
no shortage of ugly

22:07.493 --> 22:08.826
Christmas sweaters in this house.

22:08.861 --> 22:11.262
Just go up to your
father's closet and...

22:11.297 --> 22:12.297
What?

22:12.365 --> 22:13.765
Well, he just calls them sweaters.

22:14.934 --> 22:17.401
Hey, I got the stuff you
wanted for your wreaths.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.837
Thanks Ash, that's just what I needed.

22:19.872 --> 22:22.773
And I met a guy who
wants to get screened.

22:22.809 --> 22:24.442
Who, how does he know me?

22:24.477 --> 22:27.545
He doesn't, he works with
Jack, his name's Chris,

22:27.580 --> 22:29.113
seems like a really nice guy.

22:31.084 --> 22:32.149
Great.

22:35.755 --> 22:37.021
Another name on the list.

22:42.261 --> 22:46.063
So, Ma, gotta tell you something.

22:46.132 --> 22:48.499
You're going away after Christmas.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.534
I could tell by the sound of your voice.

22:50.603 --> 22:52.436
Well, I was thinking...

22:52.472 --> 22:54.638
And it's okay, you love adventure,

22:54.707 --> 22:55.940
seeing what's out there.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.519
I hope it's something
I've always encouraged.

22:57.543 --> 23:01.345
Ma, I was thinking that I
could maybe help someone here.

23:01.381 --> 23:02.646
In Frankfort.

23:02.682 --> 23:04.115
Tell me more!

23:04.150 --> 23:06.817
Well, I overheard something
at work about a girl

23:06.853 --> 23:10.688
named Heather Krueger and
she needs a liver transplant.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.657
Right away, and she needs...

23:13.693 --> 23:16.794
To find a living donor, I saw
something about this online.

23:16.829 --> 23:18.662
I shared it with everybody I know.

23:18.698 --> 23:21.399
The poor thing, I hope
she finds somebody.

23:24.771 --> 23:27.171
So...

23:27.206 --> 23:29.473
I went to get screened today,

23:29.509 --> 23:32.109
to see if I'm a possible match.

23:48.628 --> 23:50.561
The last of the molasses chips.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.229
I'll have to savor it then.

23:52.265 --> 23:53.964
Or you could not eat it.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.232
Not a chance.

24:01.374 --> 24:03.007
Those latest rounds of names, sweetie?

24:03.075 --> 24:04.108
Yeah?

24:04.977 --> 24:06.043
No matches.

24:08.748 --> 24:10.514
I hate to be the bearer of bad news.

24:10.550 --> 24:11.849
I know you do.

24:11.884 --> 24:13.362
I just feel like that's
all I'm doing lately.

24:13.386 --> 24:14.386
That's not true.

24:15.254 --> 24:16.654
This is your best batch yet.

24:16.689 --> 24:18.289
No wonder you don't have any left.

24:18.324 --> 24:20.858
I just don't know what
else I'm supposed to do.

24:21.861 --> 24:24.762
Mom, you're doing everything you can.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.265
I love you for it.

24:34.941 --> 24:36.841
Tell me you're joking.

24:36.876 --> 24:37.741
I'm not.

24:37.777 --> 24:39.543
You don't even know this girl.

24:39.579 --> 24:40.744
Nope.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.357
I don't understand,
it's like pulling teeth

24:42.381 --> 24:45.082
to try and get you to go
on a date and now this?

24:45.117 --> 24:46.450
Yeah, but ma...

24:46.486 --> 24:49.019
Getting screened is one
thing, but what if you are

24:49.055 --> 24:51.589
a match, have you thought this through?

24:51.624 --> 24:53.691
You'd actually have
to go through with it.

24:53.726 --> 24:57.428
I know, ma, I have thought
about it and it would be

24:57.463 --> 24:58.762
the right thing to do.

24:58.798 --> 25:01.398
Sacrificing to help someone else out.

25:02.969 --> 25:06.203
I mean, that's what you
guys always taught me.

25:15.748 --> 25:17.214
You are your father's son.

25:23.856 --> 25:25.055
You're okay.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.869
This is amazing.

25:38.905 --> 25:40.004
And it's almost complete.

25:41.974 --> 25:44.608
Hey, don't eat the roof tiles!

25:44.644 --> 25:45.409
They're the best part!

25:45.444 --> 25:46.444
It's true.

25:48.047 --> 25:51.515
Hi, this is Chris Dempsey,
if you're free for lunch

25:51.551 --> 25:52.794
I'd like to meet you at Stanton's.

25:52.818 --> 25:54.785
Yeah, that's the guy
that works with Jack.

25:54.820 --> 25:56.420
I guess he gave him your number.

25:56.455 --> 25:57.721
He wants to meet at noon.

25:57.757 --> 25:58.901
Probably wants to get
to know you a bit before

25:58.925 --> 26:00.758
he gets screened.

26:00.793 --> 26:01.793
Maybe.

26:02.428 --> 26:03.428
You're gonna go?

26:05.131 --> 26:06.171
Are you feeling up for it?

26:35.494 --> 26:36.494
Chris.

26:38.831 --> 26:39.831
Heather?

26:41.300 --> 26:45.069
It looks like some decor fell on you.

26:46.272 --> 26:47.137
Still a bad joke.

26:47.173 --> 26:49.206
It made me laugh.

26:51.944 --> 26:54.945
It's nice to meet you again.

26:54.981 --> 26:56.747
Likewise, likewise.

26:57.783 --> 26:59.416
So should we.

26:59.452 --> 27:02.519
Yeah.

27:02.555 --> 27:04.855
And then he says this
place overdoes Christmas.

27:04.890 --> 27:06.824
How can you overdo Christmas?

27:06.859 --> 27:07.958
That's what I said.

27:07.994 --> 27:09.237
- You can't be too festive.
- Right?

27:09.261 --> 27:10.928
I completely agree.

27:12.765 --> 27:15.532
And your date, she was on
her phone the entire time?

27:15.568 --> 27:18.636
The whole time, she seemed
like a very busy person.

27:18.671 --> 27:22.640
It's common courtesy when
you're out with someone...

27:22.675 --> 27:24.074
You're there for them!

27:24.110 --> 27:25.809
You're there for each other, exactly!

27:25.878 --> 27:27.211
You know, it is so hard to find

27:27.246 --> 27:30.581
someone who actually listens.

27:35.621 --> 27:38.422
I'm sorry, anyway, I
forgot why we were here

27:38.457 --> 27:40.124
for a minute.

27:40.192 --> 27:41.832
That's okay, I kind of forgot it myself.

27:43.729 --> 27:47.498
I just wanted to say how
thankful I am that you're

27:47.533 --> 27:49.511
doing this, I mean getting
screened for a family member

27:49.535 --> 27:52.636
is one thing, but for
somebody you don't even know...

27:52.705 --> 27:53.705
I wanted to.

27:55.341 --> 27:59.677
So do you have any questions
about the process or me?

27:59.712 --> 28:02.379
No, no, I'm good.

28:05.618 --> 28:09.453
Okay, I guess that's it then?

28:10.923 --> 28:13.223
I probably could have just called you.

28:13.259 --> 28:16.060
Some things are just better in person.

28:16.128 --> 28:17.128
This is true.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.631
And we got eggnog.

28:20.666 --> 28:22.077
Only took me a week but
it looks like I finally

28:22.101 --> 28:23.434
got my drink.

28:23.569 --> 28:25.013
You know, the service
around here can be a bit slow

28:25.037 --> 28:26.270
during the holidays.

28:29.041 --> 28:33.343
Seriously, I wanted to let
you know how grateful...

28:34.580 --> 28:36.780
I am that you're going
through with all this.

28:36.816 --> 28:40.317
You didn't have to,
you don't even know me.

28:40.352 --> 28:41.719
I know.

28:41.754 --> 28:43.854
I think it's good we had
a chance to meet properly

28:43.889 --> 28:47.191
in case things do work
out and I realize there is

28:47.259 --> 28:51.962
no guarantee once you get
screened, it's a long shot

28:52.031 --> 28:53.397
that we'll be a match.

28:53.432 --> 28:54.698
We are.

28:54.734 --> 28:56.400
But that's okay too, I don't have any...

28:59.805 --> 29:01.505
What do you mean we are?

29:02.508 --> 29:03.508
We're a match.

29:06.512 --> 29:10.147
Yeah, just got the reports back and...

29:12.351 --> 29:13.517
I am your donor.

29:14.920 --> 29:15.920
What...

29:21.060 --> 29:25.696
Are you for real?

29:29.468 --> 29:30.468
Yeah.

29:35.074 --> 29:36.540
I don't know what to say.

29:39.979 --> 29:40.979
Thank you!

29:53.626 --> 29:54.626
Are you...

29:56.996 --> 29:58.073
Have you thought about this?

29:58.097 --> 29:59.897
Are you sure this is...

30:01.801 --> 30:02.801
I'm sure.

30:08.808 --> 30:10.507
So, what is good here?

30:12.178 --> 30:16.880
Adobo chicken burritos on
special, I love Mexican food.

30:16.916 --> 30:18.048
How 'bout you?

30:20.152 --> 30:21.718
It's my favorite.

30:36.902 --> 30:38.802
- Dad!
- Sorry.

30:38.838 --> 30:40.938
- Careful.
- It didn't break, it's okay.

30:40.973 --> 30:42.150
Sweetheart, this is for cheese.

30:42.174 --> 30:43.618
Excuse me, way more sparkles.

30:43.642 --> 30:45.075
What am I supposed to use?

30:45.110 --> 30:45.876
Maybe some sprinkles on there.

30:45.911 --> 30:46.911
Better.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.346
Grab it.

30:54.587 --> 30:55.752
- Welcome!
- Hi!

30:55.788 --> 30:56.687
- Come on in!
- Thank you very much!

30:56.755 --> 30:57.755
- Hi!
- Hi!

30:57.823 --> 30:59.067
Let me get that out of your way.

30:59.091 --> 31:00.335
We have that, come your coat.

31:00.359 --> 31:01.403
Thank you, thank you very much.

31:01.427 --> 31:02.759
I'm Bill, Heather's dad.

31:02.862 --> 31:04.906
I'm Kathy, Heather's mom,
it's so nice to meet you.

31:04.930 --> 31:05.662
Hi, it's nice to meet you, pleasure.

31:05.698 --> 31:06.964
Nice to see you again.

31:06.999 --> 31:08.276
Heather's told us so much about you.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.199
Hopefully not too much.

31:09.268 --> 31:10.634
It's so great you're here.

31:10.669 --> 31:11.935
Where is Heather?

31:12.771 --> 31:13.771
Hey.

31:14.640 --> 31:15.640
Hi.

31:18.510 --> 31:19.977
Do you wanna...

31:20.012 --> 31:22.145
- Yeah, come on in!
- Great, thank you!

31:23.449 --> 31:25.015
He's so cute.

31:29.455 --> 31:30.621
So good.

31:30.689 --> 31:32.589
Those are gingerbread snowflake cookies.

31:32.658 --> 31:34.324
I love this.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.693
Thank you, we wanted to
contribute to the famous...

31:36.762 --> 31:39.229
Krueger Christmas cookie exchange.

31:39.265 --> 31:40.831
That is hard to say.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.900
I heard it was a tradition.

31:42.935 --> 31:45.435
That is just one of the
five, count 'em, five,

31:45.504 --> 31:48.472
must do Krueger family
Christmas traditions.

31:50.009 --> 31:51.486
Take a look at the big board, Chris.

31:51.510 --> 31:53.577
First up we have visiting
Christmas displays

31:53.612 --> 31:55.078
on Michigan Avenue.

31:55.114 --> 31:56.114
Done.

31:56.148 --> 31:56.980
And next, Heather.

31:57.049 --> 31:58.548
A wreath for the front door.

31:58.584 --> 32:01.051
A beautiful front door
wreath fashioned by Heather.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.353
So beautiful that
passersby may spontaneously

32:03.389 --> 32:04.288
break out in song.

32:04.323 --> 32:06.023
No.

32:06.091 --> 32:07.925
- Bill, the poor boy...
- I'm almost finished.

32:07.960 --> 32:10.961
Next up is Ashley's
favorite, eggnog at Stanton's.

32:11.030 --> 32:12.462
Always.

32:12.531 --> 32:14.409
So we were doing a Kreuger
Christmas tradition,

32:14.433 --> 32:15.732
I didn't even know it.

32:15.768 --> 32:17.234
And it was so good.

32:17.303 --> 32:18.835
Yeah, it was.

32:18.871 --> 32:21.071
Well, next up is tonight's
Christmas cookie exchange,

32:21.106 --> 32:23.440
obviously, and then fifth and final...

32:23.475 --> 32:25.155
Ooh, Heather's favorite,
Christmas dinner

32:25.210 --> 32:26.543
at the family cabin.

32:26.578 --> 32:29.012
So, Chris, tell us
about your traditions.

32:34.053 --> 32:36.853
I'm just gonna borrow
him for just two secs.

32:36.889 --> 32:38.488
- Good idea.
- Tell us later.

32:39.959 --> 32:42.893
I thought you might need
a rescue, my family can be

32:42.928 --> 32:45.629
a bit much sometimes,
especially during the holidays.

32:45.664 --> 32:48.298
No, I'm having a good time, actually.

32:48.334 --> 32:50.211
I mean, it's just been
me and my mom for so long,

32:50.235 --> 32:54.805
I'm not used to such a lively
family, but no, it's okay,

32:54.873 --> 32:56.106
they're great.

32:56.175 --> 32:57.407
Good.

32:57.443 --> 32:59.977
Can we just sit down for a minute?

33:00.012 --> 33:01.012
Yeah.

33:03.449 --> 33:05.115
Is everything okay?

33:07.252 --> 33:10.587
I'm so glad you could come
to the cookie party tonight.

33:10.622 --> 33:12.222
Yeah.

33:12.257 --> 33:13.768
Jack will be here later
and Rosa from the hospital

33:13.792 --> 33:16.426
might stop by, my Uncle Stan
and some friends from school.

33:17.496 --> 33:18.496
Heather.

33:19.231 --> 33:20.231
What is it?

33:24.436 --> 33:27.170
Sometimes I get tired.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.540
I have to call it a early night.

33:33.078 --> 33:34.478
So I'm sorry.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.246
You never have to apologize to me.

33:39.818 --> 33:40.851
Okay.

33:50.796 --> 33:52.195
All of this is Heather's doing.

33:52.231 --> 33:53.875
It looks like your cookies
are going like hotcakes.

33:53.899 --> 33:55.966
Yeah, yeah, I gotta tell my mom.

33:58.504 --> 33:59.870
I didn't know Jack was a baker.

33:59.938 --> 34:02.239
Yeah, he bakes every year.

34:02.274 --> 34:04.074
He gets real crafty in the kitchen.

34:04.877 --> 34:05.909
Jack!

34:05.944 --> 34:07.244
Hey.

34:07.279 --> 34:09.880
Hi, I'm Heather's friend Jeanette.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.516
Hi, Jeanette, Chris Dempsey.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.284
I know all about you, Chris.

34:14.319 --> 34:17.420
Heather's Christmas miracle.

34:17.456 --> 34:21.257
I don't know about that,
I just, just doing my part.

34:21.293 --> 34:22.293
We appreciate it.

34:22.327 --> 34:24.094
What are you making?

34:24.163 --> 34:24.995
Milk thistle buttermilk.

34:25.030 --> 34:27.831
Milk thistle buttermilk?

34:27.866 --> 34:29.966
It's a thing, what'd you make?

34:30.002 --> 34:33.270
I made a sugar cookie
with a caramel pecan...

34:33.304 --> 34:36.106
Excuse me, everyone, can I
have your attention, everybody?

34:36.175 --> 34:40.177
I wanna thank all of you for
joining us for the Krueger

34:40.212 --> 34:43.013
family Christmas cookie exchange.

34:45.884 --> 34:49.920
This year has been a
special one for many reasons.

34:54.159 --> 34:56.827
For Heather and for Chris...

34:58.630 --> 35:02.799
who's come into our lives
and now is in our heart.

35:04.169 --> 35:05.602
Oh, Bill.

35:06.705 --> 35:08.405
No, no, I'm fine, I can do this.

35:09.341 --> 35:10.607
- A toast.
- Yes.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.410
- To friends.
- Yes!

35:13.445 --> 35:15.779
Family, health.

35:15.814 --> 35:17.681
And Christmas miracles!

35:17.716 --> 35:19.382
To Christmas miracles!

35:19.418 --> 35:21.251
Here's to Christmas miracles.

35:24.189 --> 35:25.189
Eggnog.

35:31.196 --> 35:34.531
So, we're clear on how
all this is going to work.

35:34.566 --> 35:36.399
You both check in at six.

35:36.468 --> 35:37.634
AM or PM?

35:39.705 --> 35:42.839
So yes, six AM, Monday.

35:42.908 --> 35:43.640
Monday.

35:43.709 --> 35:44.975
This Monday!

35:47.346 --> 35:49.412
I know it feels like it's happening fast

35:49.481 --> 35:52.182
but this situation requires expediency.

35:53.385 --> 35:55.485
And how long will we be in the hospital?

35:55.521 --> 35:57.554
Anywhere from seven to 10 days.

35:57.589 --> 36:00.056
So we would be home by Christmas then.

36:01.059 --> 36:03.026
If all goes well, yes.

36:03.061 --> 36:04.194
With some time to spare.

36:05.364 --> 36:06.663
If all goes well.

36:29.254 --> 36:32.389
Are you taking Mrs.
Claus for a stroll there?

36:32.424 --> 36:35.025
Well, you know, she needs her exercise.

36:35.060 --> 36:36.660
Too many Christmas cookies.

36:38.063 --> 36:42.132
I'm looking for a tree for the cabin.

36:42.201 --> 36:44.234
Sorry, all out.

36:46.738 --> 36:48.939
Big ones are in the back there.

36:48.974 --> 36:52.742
Or do you always take the
prettiest ones for yourself?

36:52.778 --> 36:54.578
No, no.

36:54.613 --> 36:56.780
Because you would never
do that to your customers?

36:56.848 --> 36:59.316
Because I haven't needed
a Christmas tree in years.

36:59.351 --> 37:00.550
What, why?

37:01.420 --> 37:02.819
Haven't been home for Christmas.

37:02.854 --> 37:04.454
Really? Where have you been?

37:04.489 --> 37:07.257
Well, when I was with the
Marines, I was at base camp

37:07.292 --> 37:08.892
or wherever I was deployed.

37:08.927 --> 37:11.795
This is actually my first
Christmas back in five years.

37:13.365 --> 37:16.233
Your mom must be really
happy to have you home.

37:16.301 --> 37:17.334
Yeah.

37:18.604 --> 37:20.804
We'd Skype through the holidays.

37:20.839 --> 37:23.139
I'd thank her for sending
her famous Christmas cookies

37:23.208 --> 37:26.243
which would inevitably
get crushed in the mail.

37:26.278 --> 37:28.011
Do not tell her I said that.

37:31.116 --> 37:34.184
Five years, do you miss home?

37:34.253 --> 37:37.320
Yeah, but you know, I've
always been kind of restless.

37:37.389 --> 37:39.522
If you ask my mom, she
says it's because I was born

37:39.558 --> 37:41.524
on the windiest day of the year.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.159
In Chicago?

37:43.195 --> 37:44.828
That is windy.

37:44.863 --> 37:48.898
Yeah, she says that's why I
can never just settle down.

37:50.936 --> 37:53.870
You know, maybe one day you will.

37:55.374 --> 37:58.541
You know, I like to try new
things and I like to travel.

38:00.012 --> 38:02.846
In fact, I just applied
for a job overseas,

38:02.914 --> 38:04.714
Hands and Hearts Abroad?

38:04.750 --> 38:06.149
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:06.251 --> 38:08.062
One of my friends, she's a
nursing student, she worked

38:08.086 --> 38:10.987
for them last summer,
she absolutely loved it.

38:11.023 --> 38:12.555
Nice!

38:12.624 --> 38:13.624
Yeah.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.963
- Smell that?
- Yeah.

38:19.998 --> 38:21.898
Smells like Christmas.

38:21.933 --> 38:23.833
Well, to a wreath maker,
of course it would.

38:23.869 --> 38:26.803
When I trim the cedar bushes
at the cabin, the smell

38:26.838 --> 38:28.371
of fresh cut evergreen?

38:28.440 --> 38:30.106
I love it.

38:30.142 --> 38:31.775
I love that smell.

38:31.810 --> 38:34.244
I wanted to go get trimmings
before the operation

38:34.279 --> 38:36.680
so I'd have some material to
work with while recovering,

38:36.715 --> 38:40.216
but the doctor said I can't
do anything too strenuous

38:40.252 --> 38:41.551
before surgery.

38:41.687 --> 38:44.120
Are you asking me to go
to the cabin to help gather

38:44.156 --> 38:46.156
clippings for your wreaths?

38:46.191 --> 38:49.592
What, no, no, no, that wouldn't be nice.

38:49.628 --> 38:52.062
I've asked you for way too much already.

38:52.097 --> 38:54.864
Well, you haven't asked
me for anything, really.

38:54.900 --> 38:57.467
Technically no, but I can't ask...

38:57.502 --> 38:59.536
All right, you talked me into it.

39:00.605 --> 39:02.405
I'm free tomorrow.

39:11.016 --> 39:13.316
If this is a Christmas
gift, then we should wait

39:13.352 --> 39:14.896
- until Christmas.
- I want you to have

39:14.920 --> 39:16.319
this at the hospital.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.393
It's beautiful.

39:23.462 --> 39:26.863
So soft and cozy.

39:26.932 --> 39:28.898
Keep you warm at the hospital.

39:28.934 --> 39:29.934
Thank you.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.869
It's big enough to
keep you and Chris warm.

39:35.240 --> 39:36.506
Why would you say that?

39:36.541 --> 39:38.641
'Cause I met him at the cookie exchange.

39:38.677 --> 39:40.944
Come on, he is cute.

39:40.979 --> 39:43.580
I haven't really noticed.

39:45.083 --> 39:46.627
Hey, someone get the
door, I'm on cookie duty.

39:46.651 --> 39:48.585
That's for me, it's Chris.

39:48.620 --> 39:49.620
Chris, huh?

39:49.654 --> 39:50.832
- Okay.
- I'm so sorry, Jeanette,

39:50.856 --> 39:52.188
I completely lost track of time.

39:52.224 --> 39:54.791
Thank you so much for
the Christmas gift,

39:54.826 --> 39:56.126
I'll text you later!

39:56.161 --> 39:57.627
- Okay!
- Mom, going to the cabin!

39:57.662 --> 39:59.129
Have fun!

40:02.868 --> 40:04.667
Why are they going to the cabin?

40:04.703 --> 40:07.003
She should be resting,
her operation's tomorrow.

40:07.038 --> 40:09.339
Well, if I had to guess
I'd say she wants to spend

40:09.374 --> 40:11.808
her last day before the
operation with the open road

40:11.843 --> 40:13.443
ahead of her.

40:13.478 --> 40:14.377
In the company of a man
who seems like he would do

40:14.413 --> 40:15.845
just about anything for her.

40:16.748 --> 40:17.748
What?

40:21.286 --> 40:22.385
There it is.

40:30.262 --> 40:31.428
- Okay.
- Okay.

40:31.496 --> 40:33.163
Just put it in the corner there.

40:33.198 --> 40:36.199
I got it, there it is.

40:36.234 --> 40:39.969
Right over here, by the window!

40:40.005 --> 40:41.005
The window.

40:44.876 --> 40:45.876
Okay.

40:50.715 --> 40:51.715
Easy.

40:52.951 --> 40:55.552
That is officially my last
delivery for the year, so,

40:55.587 --> 40:57.231
the Frankfort Garden Center
would like to thank you

40:57.255 --> 41:00.023
for your business and
have a merry Christmas.

41:00.058 --> 41:02.192
You're very welcome and merry Christmas.

41:04.129 --> 41:05.628
This place is perfect, Heather.

41:06.598 --> 41:07.464
It's amazing.

41:07.499 --> 41:08.798
You haven't seen anything yet.

41:08.834 --> 41:11.234
My mom and dad just started decorating.

41:11.269 --> 41:12.747
Well, your sister said
this was your favorite

41:12.771 --> 41:14.370
Christmas tradition, is that why?

41:14.406 --> 41:17.640
It's the perfect ending for
the perfect Christmas season.

41:17.676 --> 41:21.411
A feast and the fireplace
roaring and the music playing

41:21.446 --> 41:23.646
and all the lights up here at night.

41:24.483 --> 41:25.548
It's magical.

41:27.385 --> 41:29.352
And who's this guy?

41:29.387 --> 41:33.356
He's my grandpa, we were
really close actually.

41:34.493 --> 41:36.526
He's the one who started
the tradition here.

41:36.595 --> 41:39.696
We'd come for Christmas
dinner and we'd play games

41:39.731 --> 41:41.564
and sing carols.

41:41.600 --> 41:45.735
He loved Christmas and he
loved spoiling us with presents.

41:45.804 --> 41:48.805
Well, he sounds like a great guy.

41:51.142 --> 41:53.309
Come on out back, I'll put you to work.

41:53.378 --> 41:54.711
Shouldn't be a problem at all

41:54.746 --> 41:56.412
for a professional such as yourself.

41:56.448 --> 41:58.748
Oh boy, professional in training.

42:04.456 --> 42:06.289
- Special delivery.
- Amazing.

42:07.626 --> 42:10.560
Boy, that is a lot of mistletoe.

42:10.595 --> 42:11.995
It's holly, silly.

42:12.030 --> 42:13.830
That isn't mistletoe?

42:13.865 --> 42:16.199
Holly's red, mistletoe's white.

42:16.268 --> 42:18.801
Mistletoe's white?

42:18.837 --> 42:20.937
A lot of people would
be surprised to know

42:20.972 --> 42:22.972
they've been kissing under
holly all these years.

42:23.041 --> 42:24.741
I bet they would be.

42:24.776 --> 42:25.909
And I work a garden center

42:25.944 --> 42:27.344
so this is especially embarrassing.

42:28.213 --> 42:30.013
It's okay, I'm a bit
of a Christmas expert.

42:30.048 --> 42:31.314
Always have been.

42:33.318 --> 42:34.795
Would you mind cutting
these into foot long pieces?

42:34.819 --> 42:35.819
Yeah, sure.

42:37.789 --> 42:40.189
So, so tell me about these famous

42:40.225 --> 42:43.126
Christmas wreathes of yours.

42:43.161 --> 42:44.460
What do you wanna know?

42:45.597 --> 42:46.597
I don't know.

42:47.666 --> 42:49.666
When'd you first start making 'em?

42:49.734 --> 42:53.570
I was a little girl, maybe six or seven.

42:53.605 --> 42:56.506
There was the most beautiful
wreath I had ever seen

42:56.541 --> 42:59.208
hung on our classroom door at school.

42:59.277 --> 43:00.755
I remember going home
and telling my parents

43:00.779 --> 43:03.580
that I wanted to make a special
wreath for our house too.

43:05.050 --> 43:08.384
And I've been making our
Christmas wreaths ever since.

43:08.420 --> 43:09.919
And every other holiday.

43:09.988 --> 43:11.154
They make great gifts, too.

43:11.189 --> 43:13.222
Do you make wreaths for every holiday?

43:13.291 --> 43:14.424
They're so festive.

43:14.459 --> 43:16.326
You should see my Thanksgiving wreath.

43:17.929 --> 43:19.696
Don't laugh!

43:19.731 --> 43:20.930
They're the real deal.

43:20.966 --> 43:23.166
I know, I wasn't laughing at...

43:24.502 --> 43:25.835
It's just very charming.

43:28.039 --> 43:30.907
Every year I make wreaths
for the women's club

43:30.942 --> 43:34.243
and the nursing home and the
hospital and my old school,

43:35.013 --> 43:36.512
I just love it.

43:36.548 --> 43:38.247
Like every holiday?

43:38.316 --> 43:41.517
Arbor Day, Groundhog
Day, Valentine's Day?

43:41.553 --> 43:43.953
Of course Valentine's Day.

43:43.989 --> 43:47.056
They say that a wreath is
a symbol of everlasting life

43:47.092 --> 43:48.124
and eternal love.

43:49.294 --> 43:52.695
I did not know that.

43:52.731 --> 43:56.833
That's why it's circular,
no beginning, no end.

43:57.802 --> 43:58.802
It's timeless.

44:06.811 --> 44:07.811
And tada!

44:09.714 --> 44:10.847
That was fast.

44:16.154 --> 44:17.620
It's beautiful.

44:19.391 --> 44:22.325
So, are you happy to be
home for Christmas this year?

44:23.528 --> 44:26.029
Apart from the whole transplant thing?

44:26.097 --> 44:28.665
Oh that, right, right.

44:28.733 --> 44:30.033
Big day's tomorrow.

44:35.206 --> 44:36.339
Chris, are you scared?

44:39.978 --> 44:40.978
No.

44:43.248 --> 44:44.380
Not at all?

44:48.253 --> 44:49.253
A little.

44:50.822 --> 44:51.822
I am too.

44:56.094 --> 44:57.094
It's okay.

45:03.101 --> 45:04.278
If I haven't told you
how much this whole...

45:04.302 --> 45:05.302
You have.

45:08.339 --> 45:09.339
You have.

45:20.318 --> 45:21.718
Okay, here we go.

45:21.820 --> 45:24.787
Okay, I've got crossword
puzzles, magazines, tea bags,

45:24.823 --> 45:27.957
your iPad and an old
hand held video game.

45:28.026 --> 45:29.759
Thanks mom, but I'll be fine.

45:29.794 --> 45:31.661
No no, it's not for you, it's for me.

45:32.564 --> 45:33.564
Mom...

45:35.667 --> 45:37.767
- It'll be okay.
- All right.

45:37.802 --> 45:39.135
Okay, what did you pack?

45:39.170 --> 45:40.470
Mom, I'm not going outside.

45:40.505 --> 45:41.537
So you have everything?

45:41.573 --> 45:43.573
Slippers, snow globe?

45:43.608 --> 45:44.941
You know I'm gonna be out cold.

45:45.009 --> 45:46.175
I'll be waiting.

45:46.211 --> 45:47.555
Hey, you're gonna do great, kiddo.

45:47.579 --> 45:48.878
Thanks, dad.

45:50.615 --> 45:52.482
- I love you.
- I love you.

45:59.090 --> 46:02.291
- I love you.
- Yeah, I love you.

46:02.327 --> 46:03.359
It's time.

46:05.296 --> 46:06.829
Time.

46:14.372 --> 46:16.239
Okay, okay, I'll be fine.

46:34.192 --> 46:35.192
Nice gurney.

46:38.797 --> 46:39.996
Yours isn't so bad either.

46:45.303 --> 46:46.736
We're going now?

46:46.771 --> 46:47.837
Yeah, it's time.

46:48.706 --> 46:49.739
Okay.

46:50.909 --> 46:52.708
Wait, why are you taking him first?

46:52.744 --> 46:54.944
It's okay, this is just how things work.

46:54.979 --> 46:56.924
We'll take you to a
different OR in just a moment.

46:56.948 --> 46:58.581
It's okay.

46:59.617 --> 47:00.650
We'll be fine.

47:01.553 --> 47:03.019
Everything is gonna be fine.

47:04.422 --> 47:06.355
What was I thinking?

47:06.391 --> 47:08.324
How could I let you do this for me?

47:09.327 --> 47:10.693
How can you not?

47:21.306 --> 47:25.241
I'll never know how
to repay you for this.

47:25.276 --> 47:27.944
You owe me absolutely nothing for this.

48:25.069 --> 48:26.069
Chris...

48:38.917 --> 48:39.917
Cookie?

48:41.185 --> 48:44.387
You don't mind that I take
my morning walk, do you?

48:44.422 --> 48:47.490
The doctor says it's really
important that I get moving

48:47.525 --> 48:49.292
and get my circulation going.

48:49.327 --> 48:51.961
Are you walking around already?

48:51.996 --> 48:52.996
Let me see here.

49:02.340 --> 49:03.139
Is it okay if I come in?

49:03.174 --> 49:04.640
Of course, come on.

49:08.913 --> 49:11.847
My parents brought
some Christmas cookies.

49:11.883 --> 49:14.884
My favorite.

49:14.953 --> 49:17.019
They're not for you, silly.

49:17.055 --> 49:18.766
They're for the nurses,
we can't eat cookies.

49:18.790 --> 49:19.922
Darn.

49:22.727 --> 49:24.560
I love that snow globe.

49:25.997 --> 49:27.530
Can I?

49:27.565 --> 49:30.333
Go ahead, it's an antique.

49:30.368 --> 49:33.169
My mom gave it to me for good luck.

49:33.237 --> 49:35.237
Sometimes you just
gotta shake things up.

49:37.542 --> 49:38.542
It's beautiful.

49:40.044 --> 49:41.811
Why are we whispering?

49:43.348 --> 49:45.014
I have no idea.

49:47.952 --> 49:50.052
What can I say, I leave 'em in stitches.

49:50.088 --> 49:51.253
Stop.

49:55.360 --> 49:57.026
How'd you get away from your nurse?

49:57.862 --> 50:00.363
She's new, easily fooled.

50:01.532 --> 50:03.432
Let's check your vitals.

50:04.369 --> 50:06.402
Once a nurse, always a nurse.

50:07.205 --> 50:09.805
Nursing student, Mr. Marine.

50:10.842 --> 50:12.174
Heather Krueger?

50:12.210 --> 50:14.343
Shoot, I think she's onto me.

50:14.379 --> 50:17.113
Yeah, you better get out of here,

50:17.148 --> 50:18.247
they're comin' for ya.

50:20.184 --> 50:21.951
See you later, gater.

50:22.020 --> 50:23.220
Heather! I'm here all week.

50:24.555 --> 50:26.655
And thanks for the cookies!

50:26.691 --> 50:28.024
They're not for you.

50:36.534 --> 50:39.201
I love Christmas movies, don't you?

50:45.276 --> 50:48.077
This is the part where
he's confused about falling

50:48.112 --> 50:49.779
in love with her.

51:32.390 --> 51:33.390
Heather.

51:34.659 --> 51:35.391
What do you think?

51:35.426 --> 51:37.159
That is ugly.

51:37.195 --> 51:39.128
For the ugly Christmas sweater party.

51:40.198 --> 51:41.297
You know you wanna go.

51:41.332 --> 51:44.266
I'm just not sure I'm ready for it.

51:45.570 --> 51:46.570
Bah!

51:47.872 --> 51:49.071
Okay, we have a winner.

51:57.815 --> 52:01.016
I am so glad you could join us, Heather.

52:01.052 --> 52:03.686
I'm a little bit slower these
days with the medications

52:03.721 --> 52:07.056
and diet and exercise, most
important thing they say to

52:07.125 --> 52:08.991
is keep living your life.

52:09.026 --> 52:10.426
That's good advice.

52:10.461 --> 52:13.095
And I do hope you can come
back and finish your degree.

52:13.131 --> 52:14.241
You're an excellent student.

52:14.265 --> 52:16.866
Thank you, that's the goal.

52:16.901 --> 52:18.534
I really love it here.

52:18.569 --> 52:19.569
See ya!

52:24.408 --> 52:28.711
Congrats, that sweater
is as ugly as it gets.

52:28.746 --> 52:30.679
Thank you, I will take
that as a compliment.

52:30.715 --> 52:33.015
You should, where's Chris?

52:33.050 --> 52:34.116
Is he here?

52:34.152 --> 52:36.619
Is he coming?

52:36.654 --> 52:40.256
No, I haven't really
talked to Chris since

52:40.291 --> 52:41.690
we left the hospital.

52:41.792 --> 52:43.871
No, no, no, you call him,
call him and tell him to grab

52:43.895 --> 52:46.529
an ugly sweater and come
on down here, come on!

52:50.368 --> 52:51.368
I will brb.

52:53.304 --> 52:54.403
Have fun.

52:54.438 --> 52:55.438
I will!

53:46.591 --> 53:49.959
So, what about Chris?

53:49.994 --> 53:51.493
Are you getting him something?

53:51.529 --> 53:52.795
I don't know.

53:52.830 --> 53:56.532
We haven't talked since
we left the hospital.

53:56.567 --> 53:57.633
Really, why?

53:59.604 --> 54:00.604
We just...

54:01.405 --> 54:02.871
We haven't.

54:02.907 --> 54:05.774
He checked out a
couple of days before me

54:05.810 --> 54:09.211
and we've both just been
settling back into our lives.

54:10.481 --> 54:14.416
And I want to talk to him, I do.

54:14.485 --> 54:16.719
I almost called him from

54:16.787 --> 54:18.954
the Christmas party at school, but...

54:18.990 --> 54:19.990
Why didn't you?

54:21.125 --> 54:22.125
I don't know.

54:23.294 --> 54:25.339
I didn't want him to feel
obligated that he had to come

54:25.363 --> 54:28.864
and I don't wanna be a burden to him.

54:28.899 --> 54:29.899
What?

54:30.868 --> 54:32.968
Okay, don't be silly,
I'm sure he doesn't

54:33.004 --> 54:34.203
see you like that.

54:34.272 --> 54:35.337
It's complicated.

54:38.042 --> 54:42.544
Do I feel this way about him
because of everything he's done

54:42.580 --> 54:46.949
for me, or because of who he is?

54:49.520 --> 54:51.398
Maybe you guys need to
spend more time together

54:51.422 --> 54:52.422
to figure that out.

54:53.424 --> 54:54.790
Give him a call.

54:57.995 --> 54:58.995
Maybe.

55:00.064 --> 55:01.630
Just call her.

55:01.666 --> 55:04.099
You go for walks, she goes for walks.

55:04.135 --> 55:07.303
I don't know, I don't want
her to feel like she has to.

55:07.371 --> 55:09.605
She wants to, I think she really does.

55:09.674 --> 55:11.106
You know this for a fact?

55:11.175 --> 55:13.642
I heard things through
the family grapevine.

55:13.678 --> 55:15.822
But maybe you guys should go
walking somewhere Christmassy.

55:15.846 --> 55:17.846
You know how much
Heather loves Christmas.

55:17.915 --> 55:18.915
Yeah.

55:20.217 --> 55:22.685
I'd love to, but I just don't
want her to feel pressured.

55:22.720 --> 55:24.420
Pressure?

55:24.455 --> 55:26.388
Trust me, she wants
to hang out with you.

55:27.725 --> 55:29.692
It's less than a week 'til Christmas.

55:29.727 --> 55:31.460
I'm sure she's busy.

55:34.465 --> 55:35.465
You'll figure it out.

55:44.342 --> 55:46.675
I'm glad I finally called you.

55:46.744 --> 55:48.255
It's so nice to have someone
to walk with for a change.

55:48.279 --> 55:49.912
Yeah, I hear ya.

55:51.082 --> 55:52.259
I maybe should have reached out sooner,

55:52.283 --> 55:55.317
- I just wasn't sure.
- No need to explain.

55:56.821 --> 55:58.053
We're here now, right?

55:59.357 --> 56:01.123
So how's my liver doing?

56:02.159 --> 56:03.892
It's holding up like a champ.

56:03.928 --> 56:04.928
How are you?

56:06.897 --> 56:09.865
A few bumps in the road,
but getting better every day.

56:10.801 --> 56:12.434
How's this for a bit of rehab?

56:12.470 --> 56:15.904
Downtown strolls and hot
chocolate from Sugar and Spice.

56:15.940 --> 56:17.973
Yeah, I could get used to this.

56:18.909 --> 56:20.776
Look, it's the Christmas light brigade.

56:20.845 --> 56:22.811
I volunteered with them last year.

56:22.847 --> 56:24.713
They take such pride in their work.

56:24.749 --> 56:26.815
Like a code of honor.

56:26.851 --> 56:28.684
Yeah, something you would know about.

56:28.753 --> 56:30.652
Yeah, little bit.

56:30.721 --> 56:35.023
It just comes down to putting
others ahead of yourself.

56:35.059 --> 56:37.359
Well, it's like you with nursing.

56:37.395 --> 56:39.895
Yeah, I'm gonna have to put
that on hold for a while.

56:41.265 --> 56:43.432
What, how come?

56:43.467 --> 56:45.634
The medical bills and
I lost my scholarships

56:45.669 --> 56:47.236
when I had to drop out of school.

56:49.540 --> 56:52.674
Anyway, we don't have to
talk about that right now.

56:52.710 --> 56:54.977
Did you hear back from that
overseas job you applied for?

56:55.012 --> 56:57.513
Good memory.

56:57.581 --> 56:58.814
Hands and Hearts Abroad.

56:59.650 --> 57:01.083
No, not yet.

57:01.118 --> 57:03.118
But you should be
hearing from them soon.

57:03.187 --> 57:04.520
Yeah, pretty soon.

57:05.756 --> 57:07.367
Sounds like a really
wonderful opportunity.

57:07.391 --> 57:08.657
I hope it works out for you.

57:09.527 --> 57:10.527
Thanks.

57:12.930 --> 57:13.930
Look at that.

57:17.101 --> 57:18.267
Yeah.

57:18.335 --> 57:20.636
It's wonderful, isn't it?

57:20.671 --> 57:21.870
Yeah, it is.

57:27.178 --> 57:29.144
Heather!

57:31.048 --> 57:33.115
- Mrs. Wilson.
- I'm so happy for you!

57:33.150 --> 57:34.150
Thank you!

57:35.085 --> 57:36.285
Mrs. Wilson...

57:36.320 --> 57:38.020
We know all about you, Chris.

57:38.055 --> 57:39.354
Thank you.

57:40.925 --> 57:42.057
For everything you've done.

57:43.861 --> 57:44.760
Merry Christmas!

57:44.795 --> 57:46.228
- Merry Christmas.
- Christmas.

57:53.671 --> 57:55.571
So, should we keep going?

57:57.575 --> 57:58.740
Yeah, yeah.

58:05.783 --> 58:06.783
Are you okay?

58:07.685 --> 58:08.784
Yeah, yeah.

58:18.796 --> 58:22.498
Honey, did I leave my hammer in there?

58:27.705 --> 58:29.371
- Hi, Chris.
- Hi.

58:29.406 --> 58:30.606
Heather's not here.

58:30.674 --> 58:32.708
Yeah, I know, that's
actually why I'm here.

58:34.345 --> 58:36.311
I have an idea I wanna run by you.

58:37.448 --> 58:38.180
A fundraiser.

58:38.249 --> 58:39.815
Yes ma'am.

58:39.884 --> 58:43.085
The tickets, raffle prizes,
donations, the whole thing.

58:43.120 --> 58:45.031
I already asked my motorcycle
club, they said they were

58:45.055 --> 58:47.022
able to help put it all together.

58:47.057 --> 58:50.792
I know the medical bills
must be overwhelming,

58:50.828 --> 58:53.629
but she should be able
to finish her degree.

58:53.664 --> 58:55.697
I mean nursing is her passion, right?

58:55.733 --> 58:57.332
Helping people.

58:57.368 --> 59:00.702
I think everyone in the
community wants to help her.

59:02.039 --> 59:04.473
We should have a celebration
that everyone can share in.

59:04.508 --> 59:06.975
Maybe we can do something
in January or February.

59:08.212 --> 59:10.245
I was thinking Christmas eve.

59:11.215 --> 59:12.814
That's less than a week away.

59:12.850 --> 59:14.683
No, I know, I know, but Christmas eve

59:14.718 --> 59:19.655
is all about family and
people coming together.

59:19.690 --> 59:21.890
I think everyone's really
gonna get behind this.

59:23.427 --> 59:25.627
It's perfect, everything
will be Christmas themed,

59:25.696 --> 59:27.529
you know she's gonna like that.

59:27.565 --> 59:29.676
Seriously, I don't think
I've ever met anyone who loves

59:29.700 --> 59:31.300
Christmas more than Heather.

59:31.335 --> 59:32.335
This is all her.

59:34.138 --> 59:36.104
Well, if you feel that
strongly about it...

59:36.140 --> 59:37.539
I do.

59:37.608 --> 59:41.076
It's a great idea, Chris,
but where would we have it?

59:41.111 --> 59:43.545
Well, that I don't
know, but it has to be

59:43.581 --> 59:48.116
someplace special, and
it has to be a surprise.

59:48.152 --> 59:49.152
Yeah.

59:52.456 --> 59:54.723
Chris, you've already
done so much for Heather.

59:58.963 --> 01:00:00.495
Well, hey, if you're gonna

01:00:00.531 --> 01:00:02.631
do something right,
you do it all the way.

01:00:13.043 --> 01:00:15.143
I'm not sure about this.

01:00:15.179 --> 01:00:17.512
What, the spicy gingerbread latte?

01:00:17.581 --> 01:00:21.083
No, silly, about what's
happening with Chris.

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:24.086
So what is happening with Chris?

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:28.223
Well, we had a really
nice time last night.

01:00:28.292 --> 01:00:29.791
So you guys hung out?

01:00:29.827 --> 01:00:34.663
He makes me feel so calm and
strong and he's so selfless,

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.500
I've never met anybody like him.

01:00:41.505 --> 01:00:44.439
I just, I don't know,
it feels really right.

01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:46.608
Then what's the issue?

01:00:48.278 --> 01:00:50.045
I don't wanna mess it up, Ash.

01:00:51.382 --> 01:00:53.582
It's like I was saying, I
don't know if I can trust

01:00:53.651 --> 01:00:54.816
how I'm feeling.

01:00:54.852 --> 01:00:56.318
Okay, look at it this way.

01:00:56.353 --> 01:01:00.288
Just forget about the
whole transplant thing.

01:01:00.324 --> 01:01:01.324
I can't.

01:01:02.326 --> 01:01:04.026
You know what I mean.

01:01:04.061 --> 01:01:07.596
If you guys just met,
like perfect strangers,

01:01:07.665 --> 01:01:08.697
would you hit it off?

01:01:12.202 --> 01:01:13.835
What do you think, Jack?

01:01:13.871 --> 01:01:15.548
I can definitely help
out with the fundraiser.

01:01:15.572 --> 01:01:16.805
I think it's a great idea.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:17.539
Only if you have time, you know.

01:01:17.574 --> 01:01:18.874
I'll make the time.

01:01:18.909 --> 01:01:20.275
Anything for Heather.

01:01:20.344 --> 01:01:22.077
Nice.

01:01:23.414 --> 01:01:26.114
I'd help you Jack, but you know.

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:27.683
No heavy lifting.

01:01:27.751 --> 01:01:29.151
Yeah, I know, I know.

01:01:29.186 --> 01:01:31.197
Hoping to be back up to speed
in a month or two though.

01:01:31.221 --> 01:01:32.754
Shouldn't be a problem.

01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:34.701
There's plenty of non
strenuous work around here.

01:01:34.725 --> 01:01:36.558
I'll have a word with the manager.

01:01:36.593 --> 01:01:37.593
You are the manager.

01:01:37.661 --> 01:01:39.628
That's why it's not a problem.

01:02:01.785 --> 01:02:02.617
Hello?

01:02:02.686 --> 01:02:03.785
Hi, Chris?

01:02:03.854 --> 01:02:04.854
Hi!

01:02:08.692 --> 01:02:09.591
Hello?

01:02:09.626 --> 01:02:11.927
Hi, Chris, it's Heather.

01:02:11.962 --> 01:02:14.096
Yeah, yeah, your name
popped up on my phone

01:02:14.131 --> 01:02:16.932
and you know, your voice
does sound familiar.

01:02:18.435 --> 01:02:20.902
Right, silly, sometimes I
forget I sound like myself.

01:02:25.008 --> 01:02:28.276
So it just occurred to me
that I might not see you again

01:02:28.312 --> 01:02:32.380
before Christmas and you
might be busy or probably

01:02:32.416 --> 01:02:36.852
busy and it's just that I
go to the cabin for Christmas

01:02:36.887 --> 01:02:40.422
dinner and then we don't
come back until New Year's.

01:02:40.457 --> 01:02:41.757
Okay.

01:02:41.792 --> 01:02:43.670
So I was wondering if
maybe you might want to go

01:02:43.694 --> 01:02:46.361
to the Christmas
Corner with me tomorrow?

01:02:46.396 --> 01:02:48.063
The Christmas Corner?

01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:50.866
Only the best Christmas store ever.

01:02:50.901 --> 01:02:53.335
I need to pick up a few things
and decorations and if you've

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:56.238
never been before, you really
should see it at Christmas

01:02:56.273 --> 01:02:58.206
time, it is beautiful.

01:03:01.578 --> 01:03:03.578
You're busy, totally understand.

01:03:03.647 --> 01:03:06.548
No, no, Heather, I would love to.

01:03:06.617 --> 01:03:07.617
Really?

01:03:08.652 --> 01:03:11.086
Great, then I'll text you in the AM.

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:15.524
Okay, that's perfect,
I'll talk to you then.

01:03:15.559 --> 01:03:17.025
See you tomorrow.

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:19.127
- All right.
- Bye.

01:03:27.538 --> 01:03:29.070
Hey.

01:03:29.106 --> 01:03:31.306
Have mom and dad talked to
you about Christmas eve yet?

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:33.341
Why?

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:35.811
They want to take us out for dinner.

01:03:35.846 --> 01:03:37.112
Just the four of us?

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:39.047
Yeah, I guess they wanna keep it small.

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:41.150
Where?

01:03:41.218 --> 01:03:43.451
The Gibraltar Hotel.

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:45.587
Isn't that where mom
and dad got married?

01:03:45.656 --> 01:03:46.855
Super fancy.

01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:48.210
Sure is, and we get to dress up.

01:03:55.432 --> 01:03:58.099
Yeah no, no, Jack, Jack,
the Gibraltar is doing

01:03:58.168 --> 01:03:59.901
all of the catering, too.

01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:02.170
I know, free of charge, it's amazing.

01:04:03.307 --> 01:04:04.840
Are you here, Jack?

01:04:04.875 --> 01:04:07.709
You know you can't stay long,
Heather is gonna be here.

01:04:07.744 --> 01:04:11.279
- Hi!
- Hey, come on in!

01:04:11.348 --> 01:04:14.649
You are early.

01:04:14.685 --> 01:04:16.518
Well, Heather time is 10 minutes early,

01:04:16.553 --> 01:04:18.687
so technically I'm right on time.

01:04:18.755 --> 01:04:20.655
And I have this for you.

01:04:21.959 --> 01:04:24.226
It's actually for you and your mom.

01:04:24.261 --> 01:04:25.627
Thank you.

01:04:25.696 --> 01:04:26.928
So merry Christmas.

01:04:26.997 --> 01:04:28.496
Merry Christmas to you too.

01:04:34.004 --> 01:04:35.570
You've got a Christmas tree.

01:04:35.606 --> 01:04:38.573
Yeah, yeah, it came when
I was in the hospital.

01:04:38.609 --> 01:04:40.542
Jack delivered it personally.

01:04:40.577 --> 01:04:42.711
I know, I know, needs
a couple more ornaments.

01:04:42.746 --> 01:04:44.779
Well, we're going to
the Christmas Corner,

01:04:44.815 --> 01:04:46.481
so works out perfectly.

01:04:47.484 --> 01:04:49.317
Great, what are we waiting on?

01:04:49.353 --> 01:04:52.287
You're gonna love it there,
the tinsel and the ornaments,

01:04:52.356 --> 01:04:55.757
they're hand done, it's
absolutely beautiful

01:04:55.826 --> 01:04:58.226
and the Christmas
trees are all decorated,

01:04:58.295 --> 01:05:00.295
each one with their own theme.

01:05:04.768 --> 01:05:06.868
Isn't this place amazing?

01:05:06.904 --> 01:05:07.904
Yeah.

01:05:10.974 --> 01:05:14.042
This little hat, what do you think, huh?

01:05:14.111 --> 01:05:17.679
Very charming, that one.

01:05:19.716 --> 01:05:21.016
Now you pick one.

01:05:21.051 --> 01:05:22.051
Me?

01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:23.518
Yes.

01:05:23.587 --> 01:05:27.689
Out of all the decorations
and ornaments, find something

01:05:27.724 --> 01:05:32.661
that inspires you, that makes
you feel something in here.

01:05:33.330 --> 01:05:34.330
Challenge accepted.

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:50.780
Found one.

01:05:55.686 --> 01:05:56.885
It's beautiful.

01:05:56.954 --> 01:05:57.954
Yeah.

01:05:58.689 --> 01:06:01.089
Angels usually are.

01:06:01.124 --> 01:06:02.324
So why this one?

01:06:03.627 --> 01:06:06.094
It reminds me of this
ornament that we had on our

01:06:06.163 --> 01:06:07.329
tree when I was a kid.

01:06:08.498 --> 01:06:09.531
That's sweet.

01:06:09.566 --> 01:06:10.566
Yeah.

01:06:10.634 --> 01:06:12.500
Well, it was, 'til it went missing.

01:06:14.271 --> 01:06:16.115
I don't know, one year
we just opened up the box

01:06:16.139 --> 01:06:17.372
and it was gone.

01:06:18.608 --> 01:06:20.241
And now you found it again.

01:06:21.345 --> 01:06:23.311
Yeah, yeah, I guess I did.

01:06:24.348 --> 01:06:25.847
Let me get it for you.

01:06:25.882 --> 01:06:27.148
- No.
- For your tree!

01:06:27.184 --> 01:06:29.050
- No, no...
- I want to.

01:06:29.086 --> 01:06:31.453
Let me do this one thing for you.

01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:34.089
And I get 10% off with my
frequent customer's card.

01:06:35.092 --> 01:06:36.524
Don't be jealous.

01:06:42.899 --> 01:06:44.944
Hey, Jack, sorry, did you
get my last text message?

01:06:44.968 --> 01:06:48.069
This is getting harder and
harder to keep this a surprise.

01:06:49.373 --> 01:06:52.207
Sorry, sorry, thought
you were someone else.

01:06:54.011 --> 01:06:55.944
Yes, yes, this is Chris Dempsey.

01:06:56.947 --> 01:06:59.948
Yeah, Mr. Spry, from
Hands and Hearts Abroad.

01:06:59.983 --> 01:07:00.983
Of course.

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:04.220
Really?

01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:07.689
That is really good, that's great.

01:07:08.825 --> 01:07:09.825
That's really great.

01:07:15.665 --> 01:07:18.066
- Come on, everybody!
- Coming!

01:07:20.404 --> 01:07:21.269
Let's go, lets go.

01:07:21.304 --> 01:07:22.470
You look so pretty.

01:07:22.539 --> 01:07:23.371
- Where you going?
- So do you.

01:07:23.407 --> 01:07:24.105
Dad, you look very handsome.

01:07:24.174 --> 01:07:25.673
Thank you.

01:07:25.709 --> 01:07:27.186
So excited, Christmas
dinner together as a family!

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:28.610
- Yeah, yeah!
- Very exciting!

01:07:28.645 --> 01:07:30.011
- So exciting!
- Come on,

01:07:30.113 --> 01:07:31.124
- we don't wanna be late!
- What time's our reservation?

01:07:31.148 --> 01:07:32.947
7:00 sharp.

01:07:40.257 --> 01:07:42.057
Sounds really busy in there.

01:07:42.125 --> 01:07:43.658
Glad we decided to keep it small.

01:07:44.928 --> 01:07:47.429
It's just through
those door, sweetheart.

01:08:24.701 --> 01:08:26.000
You look beautiful.

01:08:28.337 --> 01:08:32.140
Thank you, what is this?

01:08:32.209 --> 01:08:35.210
Just a little fundraiser.

01:08:35.245 --> 01:08:37.212
A fundraiser?

01:08:37.247 --> 01:08:40.215
To help pay the bills, so
you can go back to school.

01:08:44.488 --> 01:08:46.386
You didn't have to do this.

01:08:46.423 --> 01:08:47.423
I know.

01:08:49.091 --> 01:08:50.058
Your dad said you
didn't like a big fuss,

01:08:50.093 --> 01:08:53.294
so we dialed it back a bit.

01:08:56.832 --> 01:08:59.901
This is so much work,
you must be exhausted.

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:03.872
A little, a little, but it's okay.

01:09:03.907 --> 01:09:07.308
By the way, you look spectacular in red.

01:09:07.344 --> 01:09:08.643
Thank you.

01:09:09.712 --> 01:09:10.778
So do you.

01:09:10.814 --> 01:09:13.915
I mean, you look very handsome.

01:09:16.953 --> 01:09:18.886
Thank you, it's just a suit.

01:09:20.624 --> 01:09:22.157
It's not the suit.

01:09:25.529 --> 01:09:27.929
Well, should I show you around?

01:09:29.533 --> 01:09:30.932
Yeah.

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:39.340
Could I have one, maybe two?

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:41.609
Hey Ash, did you see these?

01:09:41.645 --> 01:09:43.411
Truffles.

01:09:43.446 --> 01:09:46.046
White chocolate truffle
snowmen, seriously?

01:09:47.149 --> 01:09:48.983
They're even better if you eat 'em.

01:09:51.121 --> 01:09:52.353
Don't let him go!

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:53.921
- Wait, wait!
- Wait!

01:09:53.957 --> 01:09:54.957
Kathy?

01:10:04.201 --> 01:10:05.201
- Wine.
- Wine, yes, yes!

01:10:08.004 --> 01:10:09.437
Hello?

01:10:11.741 --> 01:10:15.176
First of all, thank
you guys for coming out.

01:10:21.818 --> 01:10:23.718
Special thanks to the nursing school.

01:10:23.753 --> 01:10:24.753
Nurses rule!

01:10:25.922 --> 01:10:29.891
The University of Illinois
hospital and my motorcycle

01:10:29.926 --> 01:10:32.660
club for donating that big
beauty right over there.

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.477
Can't forget the
Frankfort Garden Center.

01:10:38.501 --> 01:10:40.802
Yes, thank you Jack, yes, how could we?

01:10:41.938 --> 01:10:46.574
Words can't express how
grateful I am for all

01:10:46.643 --> 01:10:49.811
the generosity in this room
and for this to have happened

01:10:49.846 --> 01:10:52.614
in such a short amount of
time is really, really nothing

01:10:52.649 --> 01:10:54.415
short of a miracle.

01:10:58.188 --> 01:11:00.068
And now the person that
we all came here to see,

01:11:01.057 --> 01:11:05.994
Heather Krueger.

01:11:11.434 --> 01:11:13.735
I don't know what to say.

01:11:15.305 --> 01:11:19.240
I'm so overwhelmed by all of
this, all of your generosity.

01:11:20.744 --> 01:11:24.045
The best thing about Christmas
is right here in this room.

01:11:25.415 --> 01:11:27.815
And tonight is a celebration of that.

01:11:29.953 --> 01:11:33.154
I just wanna say thank
you for all of your love

01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:35.757
and generosity these last few weeks.

01:11:37.294 --> 01:11:40.428
From the bottom of my heart,
I am so glad to be here.

01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:51.306
But thank you again and
of course, merry Christmas.

01:11:51.374 --> 01:11:53.341
Merry Christmas!

01:12:18.501 --> 01:12:19.501
Hi.

01:12:31.081 --> 01:12:31.946
You can dance.

01:12:31.981 --> 01:12:33.414
I didn't know that about you.

01:12:34.751 --> 01:12:37.985
A little bit slower these
days, but yeah, still got it.

01:12:39.222 --> 01:12:40.502
I think we have that in common.

01:12:45.562 --> 01:12:48.596
I've been meaning to talk to you.

01:12:48.631 --> 01:12:50.131
Yeah?

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.200
What did you want to talk about?

01:12:52.235 --> 01:12:56.637
I got the job with
Hands and Hearts Abroad.

01:12:56.673 --> 01:12:58.439
You got the job?

01:12:58.475 --> 01:13:02.643
That's, that's great, Chris.

01:13:02.712 --> 01:13:05.947
Congratulations, I'm,
I'm so happy for you.

01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:08.483
Yeah, thanks.

01:13:09.619 --> 01:13:11.352
I mean, I haven't given them a decision.

01:13:11.421 --> 01:13:13.988
But I wanted to talk to you.

01:13:14.958 --> 01:13:16.090
Why wouldn't you?

01:13:16.126 --> 01:13:18.893
It's what you wanna do, right?

01:13:18.928 --> 01:13:20.995
Yeah, no, you're right, it is.

01:13:23.333 --> 01:13:26.667
Things are a little bit
more complicated now.

01:13:28.972 --> 01:13:29.972
Aren't they?

01:13:32.375 --> 01:13:36.511
Yeah, things are...

01:13:39.215 --> 01:13:40.215
Complicated.

01:13:45.622 --> 01:13:47.388
I'm sorry, I just need a minute.

01:13:48.591 --> 01:13:49.591
All right.

01:14:01.137 --> 01:14:03.171
Hey, is everything okay?

01:14:03.206 --> 01:14:04.572
Are you all right?

01:14:04.641 --> 01:14:05.885
I think you should take the job.

01:14:05.909 --> 01:14:07.608
Heather, I told you I haven't...

01:14:07.644 --> 01:14:09.744
No, no, no, no. You should.

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:13.481
You've done so much for
me, Chris, more than...

01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:16.884
More than any person could ever ask.

01:14:19.022 --> 01:14:21.789
But I think it's time that
you do something for yourself.

01:14:23.159 --> 01:14:24.159
You deserve it.

01:14:26.062 --> 01:14:27.462
It's just my two cents.

01:14:31.701 --> 01:14:34.836
Heather, I'm having
some conflicting feelings

01:14:34.871 --> 01:14:37.338
and I wanna talk to you.

01:14:38.608 --> 01:14:39.674
Yeah, sure.

01:14:42.278 --> 01:14:44.378
We can and we will.

01:14:47.083 --> 01:14:48.716
But maybe after Christmas, okay.

01:14:54.791 --> 01:14:56.257
Your tie's crooked.

01:14:59.762 --> 01:15:01.529
And I meant what I said before.

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.800
Don't wanna hold you back from anything.

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:25.286
This is for Heather.

01:15:25.321 --> 01:15:26.787
Thank you.

01:15:26.823 --> 01:15:28.256
The other one's for me.

01:15:28.291 --> 01:15:30.024
I know you're not gonna be doing that.

01:15:30.059 --> 01:15:31.592
- For me.
- Thank you!

01:15:32.695 --> 01:15:34.529
Aw, they're so perfect!

01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:38.132
The biggest one.

01:15:42.805 --> 01:15:45.239
- I need it.
- Yes you do.

01:15:45.275 --> 01:15:46.541
And I love it.

01:15:46.576 --> 01:15:49.176
And I think I'm going
to fill it right now.

01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:51.846
If you can ever find your tools.

01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:53.180
I heard that.

01:15:53.216 --> 01:15:53.981
Come back, you two.

01:15:54.017 --> 01:15:55.049
Oh, dad.

01:16:00.156 --> 01:16:02.056
Oh, it's lovely!

01:16:02.091 --> 01:16:04.058
Heather is talented.

01:16:04.093 --> 01:16:05.093
Yeah, she is.

01:16:06.262 --> 01:16:09.297
We'll hang it 'til
New Year's, or longer.

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:14.335
Are you okay, honey?

01:16:15.939 --> 01:16:17.738
Yeah, yeah.

01:16:18.875 --> 01:16:19.875
I'm okay.

01:16:22.845 --> 01:16:23.611
You want some tea?

01:16:23.646 --> 01:16:24.646
Sure.

01:16:32.188 --> 01:16:33.188
Hey.

01:16:34.691 --> 01:16:36.457
Hey.

01:16:36.492 --> 01:16:38.926
Something's been on your
mind since last night.

01:16:42.832 --> 01:16:44.465
Last night was amazing and wonderful

01:16:44.534 --> 01:16:46.067
in so many ways.

01:16:46.102 --> 01:16:47.501
It was.

01:16:47.537 --> 01:16:49.870
I said some things to Chris last night

01:16:49.906 --> 01:16:52.473
and they didn't get resolved.

01:16:52.508 --> 01:16:53.608
You can resolve them.

01:16:56.546 --> 01:16:58.546
He's given so much to me,
I don't know what I can

01:16:58.581 --> 01:17:00.081
possibly give him back.

01:17:04.554 --> 01:17:07.021
Well, you know how you
feel about him, right?

01:17:07.090 --> 01:17:08.090
In your heart?

01:17:10.226 --> 01:17:11.726
Yes.

01:17:11.761 --> 01:17:13.928
Well, the greatest gift

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:15.930
you can give anyone, sweetie, is love.

01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:30.878
- Ooh, what are these?
- Little pastry puffs.

01:17:30.913 --> 01:17:34.448
Made with brie and cranberry sauce.

01:17:34.484 --> 01:17:37.351
This another one of your online recipes?

01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:39.787
No, it's one of my own.

01:17:39.822 --> 01:17:41.622
I made it from scratch.

01:17:41.691 --> 01:17:43.190
For my MIPS.

01:17:47.697 --> 01:17:50.631
Tasty, if I may say so myself!

01:17:50.667 --> 01:17:52.767
I say so too.

01:17:54.704 --> 01:17:56.303
Wanna see who's texting you?

01:17:56.372 --> 01:17:58.172
It's probably just Jack.

01:17:58.207 --> 01:18:01.342
You don't wanna know who's
wishing you merry Christmas?

01:18:09.052 --> 01:18:12.486
It's Heather, she wants me to...

01:18:12.522 --> 01:18:13.821
Now?

01:18:13.856 --> 01:18:15.489
Yeah.

01:18:15.525 --> 01:18:17.525
If you're okay with me
going out on Christmas

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:20.461
for just a little bit but
I don't wanna leave you.

01:18:20.496 --> 01:18:23.431
You can go anywhere and
you'd never leave me.

01:18:23.466 --> 01:18:24.899
Go see her.

01:18:24.934 --> 01:18:25.934
Thanks, mom!

01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:28.870
Take one!

01:18:31.808 --> 01:18:32.808
Or two.

01:18:41.718 --> 01:18:42.718
Hello?

01:18:55.898 --> 01:18:56.898
Anybody here?

01:19:00.136 --> 01:19:01.136
Hi.

01:19:02.405 --> 01:19:03.405
Hi.

01:19:05.041 --> 01:19:08.175
I'm really glad you could make it.

01:19:08.211 --> 01:19:10.811
Yeah, yeah, so am I.

01:19:12.415 --> 01:19:15.116
I wanted you to see it,
the last of the Kruegers'

01:19:15.151 --> 01:19:17.985
five must do Christmas traditions.

01:19:18.654 --> 01:19:20.454
And your favorite.

01:19:20.490 --> 01:19:21.956
Yes.

01:19:22.024 --> 01:19:25.593
Well, I can see why, it's magnificent.

01:19:28.831 --> 01:19:33.768
My folks and Ash will be
here soon, I wanted a chance

01:19:34.604 --> 01:19:37.071
to talk to you about last night.

01:19:39.408 --> 01:19:40.408
Heather...

01:19:42.979 --> 01:19:43.711
You don't have to explain.

01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:45.479
No, I do.

01:19:45.515 --> 01:19:50.351
I know you're struggling
with all of this, but...

01:19:50.386 --> 01:19:51.386
I know.

01:19:52.421 --> 01:19:56.991
And I was struggling
because we have this unique

01:19:57.026 --> 01:19:58.659
and special bond.

01:20:00.296 --> 01:20:02.396
And all the time, I was thinking maybe

01:20:03.599 --> 01:20:05.032
it was just because I'm sick,

01:20:06.269 --> 01:20:09.570
but then we spent more
time together and I realized

01:20:09.639 --> 01:20:10.639
it goes beyond that.

01:20:18.948 --> 01:20:23.017
Chris, you are the most
incredible man I've ever met.

01:20:24.787 --> 01:20:25.787
You're my angel.

01:20:27.456 --> 01:20:30.257
You make me laugh and smile every day.

01:20:32.395 --> 01:20:33.694
You dare me to dream.

01:20:37.834 --> 01:20:40.801
But I don't wanna stand
in the way of your dreams.

01:20:41.804 --> 01:20:43.270
My dreams are right here.

01:20:45.041 --> 01:20:46.041
With you.

01:21:12.235 --> 01:21:15.369
Does this mean I'm staying for dinner?

01:21:29.285 --> 01:21:30.351
Think that's a yes.

01:21:55.544 --> 01:21:57.878
I used to think happy
endings could only happen

01:21:57.914 --> 01:22:02.850
in fairytales, but
sometimes, they can be real.

01:22:05.521 --> 01:22:07.254
And standing right in front of you.

01:22:10.826 --> 01:22:12.593
I'm living my miracle every day.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.435
Time's a precious gift,
to be handled with care

01:22:22.805 --> 01:22:24.004
and opened with love.

01:22:29.645 --> 01:22:33.314
He was my Christmas angel and I was his.

01:22:34.305 --> 01:22:40.832
