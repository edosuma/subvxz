WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:03.835
<i>(tim)</i> focus on me,
pull off al...

00:03.836 --> 00:06.571
<i>(man)</i> ok, we're going
in 60 seconds.

00:06.572 --> 00:09.474
<i>(jill)</i> tim?
Hold on a second.
What, honey? What?

00:09.475 --> 00:11.476
Excuse me.

00:11.477 --> 00:13.778
There are trucks
double-parked all the way
down the street.

00:13.779 --> 00:16.347
You said that if you did
<i>tool time</i> from our bathroom,

00:16.347 --> 00:19.050
That it would be you, al,
heidi and one cameraman.

00:19.051 --> 00:22.020
Wait till the audience
gets here.

00:22.021 --> 00:25.156
I'm just kidding.
Look, I had to do something
to boost the ratings, all right?

00:25.157 --> 00:27.391
Oh, this'll be a real
ratings-grabber.

00:27.392 --> 00:29.628
"hey, myrtle, forget hawaii.
Let's just stay home

00:29.629 --> 00:32.563
And watch tim play
with his toilet."

00:32.564 --> 00:36.101
Ok, we're going. If you're not
in this shot, get off the set.
Let's go, let's go.

00:36.102 --> 00:39.170
Let's have a good one!
Come on!

00:39.171 --> 00:41.740
All right, we're going
in five, four, three, two...

00:41.741 --> 00:46.310
Welcome to a very special
<i>tool</i> <i>time,</i> live from
tim's bathroom.

00:46.311 --> 00:48.713
Now here they are,
those princes of porcelain,

00:48.714 --> 00:52.517
Those titans of the toilet,
those jokers of the john,

00:52.518 --> 00:54.919
Those bad boys of the bowl,

00:54.920 --> 00:56.621
Those...
<i>(tim)</i> heidi!

00:56.622 --> 00:59.457
Sorry.
Tim taylor and al borland.

01:03.395 --> 01:05.964
It's water conservation week
on <i>tool time,</i>

01:05.965 --> 01:08.566
And what better place
to conserve some water than
right here in the bathroom?

01:08.567 --> 01:11.803
That's right. Today we're
gonna show you how to install
low-flow aerators,

01:11.804 --> 01:16.007
Shower heads, and some
water-conserving devices
for the toilet.

01:16.008 --> 01:18.910
But first, a little
<i>tool time</i> riddle.

01:18.911 --> 01:21.412
What does the 50-yard line,
behind home plate

01:21.413 --> 01:23.048
And your home toilet
have in common?

01:23.049 --> 01:26.017
<i>(makes buzzer noise)</i>
the best seats in the house!

01:32.925 --> 01:35.493
All right, now.

01:35.494 --> 01:39.597
The standard toilet
uses about 3.5 gallons
per flush.

01:39.598 --> 01:42.834
Now, you can lessen that amount
by displacing the water
in the tank.

01:42.835 --> 01:47.072
You do that by taking off
the top and filling
that with large, heavy objects.

01:47.073 --> 01:48.639
Now, we're not sure
if it's gonna work,

01:48.640 --> 01:51.542
But we're gonna have al jump
in there. Ok, al, hop in.

01:51.543 --> 01:55.680
I was talking more along
the lines of perhaps
a brick, a bag of marbles

01:55.681 --> 01:58.683
Or a plastic bottle
filled with water.

01:58.684 --> 02:01.986
Another way to conserve water,
if you can afford it,
is a new toilet.

02:01.987 --> 02:05.423
What we recommend is
the binford 6100 series
pressure-activated toilet.

02:05.424 --> 02:08.126
That's right.
It only uses 1.4 gallons
of water.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.660
Better than any toilet
on the market.

02:09.661 --> 02:14.132
Not true. The toilet
on the space shuttle
uses absolutely no water.

02:17.236 --> 02:19.771
Thank you, flush gordon.

02:21.573 --> 02:23.374
We'll be back
with more toilet tips

02:23.375 --> 02:25.576
After these few messages
from binford.

02:27.412 --> 02:30.782
Don, do something about
the lights in here.
What the heck is going on?

02:30.783 --> 02:33.584
<i>(al)</i> klaus? Klaus?
<i>(heidi)</i> wardrobe?

02:33.585 --> 02:36.487
They're towing cars.
If you're double-parked,
better move 'em.

02:36.488 --> 02:39.157
All right, move the cars.
Didn't you get permits?

02:39.158 --> 02:41.726
Hurry, hurry, let's go.
Hustle, hustle.

02:41.727 --> 02:44.328
Hey, where are you guys going?
We're on!

02:44.329 --> 02:47.766
We're on in five, four,
three, two...

02:50.770 --> 02:54.272
Welcome back to <i>tool time,</i>
with those kings of the can,

02:54.273 --> 02:58.877
Those lords of the loo,
those thrill-seekers
of the throne,

02:58.878 --> 03:00.812
Those heroes of the head,

03:00.813 --> 03:03.681
Those...
<i>(tim)</i> heidi!

03:53.966 --> 03:55.967
Man, I can't wait
till Saturday.

03:55.968 --> 03:58.602
Sherman's bar mitzvah's
gonna be awesome.

03:58.603 --> 04:01.405
I thought you had to be jewish
to go to a bar mitzvah?

04:01.406 --> 04:04.675
Right, mark.
And you have to be swiss
to eat cheese.

04:06.879 --> 04:08.646
What is a bar mitzvah, anyways?

04:08.647 --> 04:11.749
When a jewish boy turns 13,
they say a whole bunch
of prayers,

04:11.750 --> 04:14.518
And then eventually
his family throws him
a huge party,

04:14.519 --> 04:16.786
With lots of food
and tons of presents.

04:16.788 --> 04:20.992
Cool. You think if I start
praying now, I could have
a bar mitzvah?

04:20.993 --> 04:22.894
Yeah, mark,
why don't you do that?

04:22.895 --> 04:25.964
Then tomorrow you can
pray for a new brain.

04:25.965 --> 04:28.199
I just hope
I don't get yours.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.268
Hi, kids.

04:30.269 --> 04:33.571
Randy, I picked up your suit
at the dry cleaners.

04:33.572 --> 04:37.342
I also got a bunch of stuff
that you left in the pockets -
a half-sucked candy cane

04:37.343 --> 04:39.344
And a phone message
you never gave me.

04:39.345 --> 04:41.346
Oh, yeah. Call grandma.

04:43.215 --> 04:46.150
Hey, honey.
You'll never guess who called.

04:46.151 --> 04:47.618
My mother.

04:47.619 --> 04:50.621
Yeah, but that was
a couple days ago.

04:50.622 --> 04:52.690
Well, thank you.

04:52.691 --> 04:55.293
That's a week sooner than you
usually give me the message.

04:55.294 --> 04:57.561
Well, I knew it was important.

04:57.562 --> 04:59.563
My brother marty called.

04:59.564 --> 05:03.167
He and nancy are driving down
on Friday.
They want to stay over.

05:03.168 --> 05:05.870
Oh, that's great!
I get to see the babies again.

05:05.871 --> 05:09.540
Oh, no. The little pooper
troopers are staying with mom.

05:09.541 --> 05:11.642
You know, he's got
a job interview
on Saturday.

05:11.643 --> 05:14.478
If he gets that job,
I think they're gonna move
here.

05:14.479 --> 05:18.082
That would be great.
We'd get to play with those
babies all the time.

05:18.083 --> 05:20.418
And I get to play
with my baby brother.

05:20.419 --> 05:24.188
You're not gonna put him
in a red ant hill again,
are you?

05:24.189 --> 05:27.292
Honey, I think I've grown
out of that kind of prank.

05:27.293 --> 05:30.328
Give him atomic wedgies?

05:30.329 --> 05:32.463
Way too old for that.

05:32.464 --> 05:35.466
Fake vomit in the shoes?

05:35.467 --> 05:37.468
Never too old for that.

05:40.439 --> 05:42.573
If I get this job,
I'd be working for

05:42.574 --> 05:45.810
One of the fastest-growing
sporting goods stores
in the state.

05:45.811 --> 05:48.179
It's got through-the-roof
potential.

05:48.180 --> 05:51.382
Honey, that's just how I felt
when I started with binford.

05:51.383 --> 05:55.920
Yeah, and tim's been through
seven or eight roofs.

05:55.921 --> 05:58.889
Actually, six,
and a porta-potti.

05:58.890 --> 06:02.393
You sure you don't want
some pancakes, marty?
No, thanks, jill.

06:02.394 --> 06:04.595
Before an interview,
I don't like to eat
anything heavy.

06:04.596 --> 06:07.765
My pancakes aren't heavy.
<i>(thud)</i>

06:07.766 --> 06:10.201
Here, try that one.
<i>(strains)</i>

06:10.202 --> 06:11.535
Ow!

06:14.739 --> 06:16.474
I'm back.

06:17.642 --> 06:20.078
I just ran about
five miles.
All right!

06:20.079 --> 06:22.880
Oh, did you call home?
How is everything?
My mom's fine.

06:22.881 --> 06:25.616
I was talking about
the babies.

06:25.617 --> 06:28.286
I don't know. They wouldn't
come to the phone.

06:28.287 --> 06:29.520
Ow!

06:29.521 --> 06:32.790
Where do they learn that?
Swat team.

06:32.791 --> 06:36.461
I can't believe you.
Your first morning away
from the kids.

06:36.462 --> 06:38.363
You could have slept in.

06:38.364 --> 06:42.566
Nope. I am determined
to get my old body back.

06:52.077 --> 06:54.078
It's back.

06:56.148 --> 06:58.883
I still have a few more
pounds to lose.

06:58.884 --> 07:01.619
Oh, you look great.
I'd take that body in a minute.

07:01.620 --> 07:03.621
So would I.

07:06.525 --> 07:08.459
What does that mean?

07:08.460 --> 07:12.897
If I had a body like that,
I could wear the jogging bra
I've always wanted to.

07:12.898 --> 07:16.267
I picture you more in
a strapless push-up.
Yeah?

07:16.268 --> 07:18.636
Really, nancy,
how comfortable is that bra?

07:18.637 --> 07:21.805
I mean, does it chafe?
I'm so sensitive
in this area...

07:21.806 --> 07:23.574
Tim, enough with the bra.

07:23.575 --> 07:26.610
I'm off to the job interview.
Wish me luck.

07:26.611 --> 07:29.113
Hey, you don't need luck.
You're a taylor.

07:29.114 --> 07:31.282
That's right.
You need directions.

07:32.918 --> 07:36.187
That reminds me. I got a map
for you out in the car.

07:36.188 --> 07:39.890
Wrong way.
Your car's out front.
Of course it is.

07:39.891 --> 07:42.593
You want me to get you
some pancakes?
Oh, I'd love some.

07:42.594 --> 07:45.729
But then I'd have to run
about another six miles.

07:45.730 --> 07:47.932
Well, I think I'm gonna
go up and take a hot shower.

07:47.933 --> 07:50.134
My back gets a little stiff
when I don't run on the track.

07:50.135 --> 07:52.270
Well, that's good,
but use our bathroom,

07:52.271 --> 07:54.272
'cause randy's been
in his all morning.

07:54.273 --> 07:57.241
Oh, has he got a big date?
Big bar mitzvah.

07:57.242 --> 08:02.880
Oh, my gosh. I gotta run out
and get sherman a present.

08:02.881 --> 08:06.084
Oh! Do you want to borrow
my earmuffs? It's really
nippy out there.

08:06.085 --> 08:08.953
No, nancy, when I say "run out"
I mean "take the car."

08:08.954 --> 08:11.489
I'll see you later.
Bye-bye.
Bye.

08:14.593 --> 08:18.463
It's started to clear up
out there, you guys.

08:18.464 --> 08:20.698
Nancy?

08:20.699 --> 08:22.333
Jill?

08:24.269 --> 08:26.237
Hey, jill?

08:29.774 --> 08:32.977
<i>(shower running)</i>
honey?

08:32.977 --> 08:34.578
Jill?

08:35.813 --> 08:37.181
Jill?

08:38.583 --> 08:40.683
Jill.

09:10.215 --> 09:13.050
Hey!
Tim!

09:13.051 --> 09:14.985
You're...

09:14.986 --> 09:17.888
You're not jill!

09:17.889 --> 09:19.890
I'll go now.

09:24.163 --> 09:27.731
I am so sorry. I'm so sorry.
<i>(nancy)</i> no, no. I'm sorry.

09:27.732 --> 09:30.268
No, no, I thought jill was
in there, you're not jill.

09:30.269 --> 09:33.304
What I need is a sign-in sheet.
You know, "nancy in, tim out."

09:33.305 --> 09:35.439
I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't have used
your bathroom.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.741
It's just that jill said that
randy was in the other one.

09:37.742 --> 09:39.910
There's nothing to explain.

09:39.911 --> 09:42.213
For gosh sakes,
we're two mature adults

09:42.214 --> 09:44.682
That happened to see
each other's hoo-hoos.

09:47.619 --> 09:50.388
This is really embarrassing.
Yeah, it is a little bit,
isn't it?

09:50.389 --> 09:52.390
Although what do we have
to be embarrassed about?

09:52.391 --> 09:55.025
It's not like either
of us hasn't seen
a naked body before.

09:55.026 --> 09:57.861
I've seen thousands of 'em.

09:57.862 --> 09:59.930
We have absolutely
nothing to be ashamed of.

09:59.931 --> 10:02.233
Yeah. Especially you!

10:04.969 --> 10:07.405
Thanks.

10:07.406 --> 10:11.141
Actually, when you think
about it, it's kinda funny.

10:11.142 --> 10:12.743
Yeah, it's funny. Yeah.

10:12.744 --> 10:14.712
Marty and jill are gonna
get a good laugh out of this.

10:14.713 --> 10:17.481
I don't think it's that funny.

10:19.651 --> 10:20.984
You think they're gonna
get upset?

10:20.985 --> 10:23.487
No, 'cause I don't think
we should tell them.

10:23.488 --> 10:25.556
Time, it was an accident.
They'll understand.

10:25.557 --> 10:27.891
I don't think jill
will understand.

10:27.892 --> 10:30.628
After all those jokes
I made about the jogging bra
this morning,

10:30.629 --> 10:32.863
I think it's best
we just let it go. Ok?

10:32.864 --> 10:34.398
You really think we
shouldn't say anything?

10:34.399 --> 10:36.800
I think if we told them
what we saw,

10:36.801 --> 10:38.469
We'd be a couple of boobs.

10:51.783 --> 10:54.017
Wilson, I want to
ask you a question.

10:54.018 --> 10:56.019
<i>(smashing noises)</i>

10:58.724 --> 11:00.358
What are you doing?

11:00.359 --> 11:03.394
You know, tim, I'm practicing
an ancient greek tradition.

11:05.397 --> 11:08.633
It's said that to fend off
a flea problem...

11:10.569 --> 11:12.936
...You pelt the front
of your door with jugs.

11:12.937 --> 11:15.005
Oh, don't use that word.

11:17.409 --> 11:19.810
Um... I...

11:19.811 --> 11:23.381
I inadvertently saw
my sister-in-law in the buff.

11:23.382 --> 11:25.750
I walked in the shower,
I thought jill was in there

11:25.751 --> 11:27.752
And she was standing
right there.

11:27.753 --> 11:31.255
Well, tim, that sounds
totally innocent.
It was.

11:31.256 --> 11:34.992
But she's family, and you expect
family to give a reaction

11:34.993 --> 11:37.995
Like your 80 or 90-year-old
grandma, but...

11:37.996 --> 11:41.098
Grandma never looked
like that.

11:41.099 --> 11:44.001
So you enjoyed seeing nancy
in her birthday suit.

11:44.002 --> 11:48.005
It was a very happy birthday.
Yes, I did.

11:48.006 --> 11:51.008
Well, tim, this brings to mind
the great buddha.

11:51.009 --> 11:53.110
A cheese.

11:53.111 --> 11:55.446
That's gouda.

11:55.447 --> 11:58.248
I'm talking about buddha.
The prophet.
Ah.

11:58.249 --> 12:00.984
Even though I've always
considered him
a pretty big cheese.

12:00.985 --> 12:03.187
<i>(chuckles)</i>

12:03.188 --> 12:04.922
Anyway...

12:04.923 --> 12:07.090
Buddha says that men
are conquerors

12:07.091 --> 12:09.927
If they have conquered
the intoxications
of temptation.

12:09.928 --> 12:13.331
Yeah. Oh, that's... <i>(grunts)</i>

12:17.436 --> 12:21.038
I have no idea
what you just said.

12:21.039 --> 12:23.307
What I'm saying is it's
perfectly natural for a man

12:23.308 --> 12:25.509
To be drawn to a woman
he finds attractive.

12:25.510 --> 12:27.745
I just wish this
hadn't happened.

12:27.746 --> 12:30.614
If I'm gonna walk in
on a family member,

12:30.615 --> 12:32.817
It should be
my brother brian's wife.

12:34.919 --> 12:37.321
No, grandma, mom's not here.

12:37.322 --> 12:39.724
Yeah, she's having lunch
with aunt nancy.

12:39.725 --> 12:42.292
All right, I'll give her
the message.

12:45.230 --> 12:49.233
Ok, grandma.
I'm writing it down right now.

12:49.234 --> 12:51.736
Ok. Love you too.

12:57.242 --> 12:59.610
Sherman's bar mitzvah's
already over?

12:59.611 --> 13:01.979
No, but for me
it's in limbo.

13:01.980 --> 13:03.414
What do you mean?

13:03.415 --> 13:06.851
I, uh, split my pants
doing the limbo.

13:08.920 --> 13:10.921
Where's mom? I need her
to sew these back up

13:10.922 --> 13:12.990
So I can get back
to the party.

13:12.991 --> 13:15.993
She's not here.
What am I gonna do?

13:15.994 --> 13:18.228
I don't know.
I know.

13:18.229 --> 13:20.464
Staple me shut.

13:39.951 --> 13:42.986
I hate to pry, fellas.

13:42.987 --> 13:44.555
What are you doing?

13:44.556 --> 13:47.057
Randy split his pants
doing the limbo.

13:47.058 --> 13:50.127
And you're using
a stapler to fix it?

13:50.128 --> 13:53.130
That's material on human flesh
back there, pal.

13:53.131 --> 13:55.265
Let me get my hot glue gun.

13:57.669 --> 14:00.805
So long, dad.
Wait, wait.
I'm not done yet.

14:02.707 --> 14:05.543
One brother stapling
another's butt.

14:05.544 --> 14:08.446
Brings back fond memories.

14:08.447 --> 14:10.581
It was never my intent
to hurt you.

14:10.582 --> 14:12.115
How'd it go?

14:12.116 --> 14:14.184
I got it. You're looking
at the new manager.

14:14.185 --> 14:16.320
Congratulations!
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

14:16.321 --> 14:20.691
I want to tell nancy.
Have you seen her?
No. Why?

14:20.692 --> 14:23.494
Just asking. Hey, this is
gonna be great, isn't it?

14:23.495 --> 14:26.196
Yeah.
You and me back in
the same city again.

14:26.197 --> 14:30.033
Although... I don't know
if I can afford a house
out here.

14:30.034 --> 14:33.203
Come on, come on.
We'll go look for one,
maybe a little fixer-upper.

14:33.204 --> 14:35.205
And you know
who can do the fixing.

14:36.475 --> 14:38.208
I'm hoping al.

14:39.878 --> 14:42.480
Hey! Nance, jill.
I got the job.

14:42.481 --> 14:44.982
Oh, great!

14:44.983 --> 14:47.284
I knew you would!

14:47.285 --> 14:50.187
<i>(jill)</i> congratulations!
Welcome to the neighborhood.

14:50.188 --> 14:52.189
<i>(marty)</i> thanks very much.

14:58.029 --> 14:59.897
Thanks.

14:59.898 --> 15:02.633
Hey, I want to
propose a toast.
All right.

15:02.634 --> 15:06.971
My new job, to tim and jill
for all your encouragement,

15:06.972 --> 15:08.973
And to my lovely wife,
nancy -

15:08.974 --> 15:11.074
Who's always
been there for me.

15:11.075 --> 15:12.977
Congratulations, marty.

15:12.978 --> 15:16.714
Who I must say is looking
particularly delightful
this evening in this outfit.

15:16.715 --> 15:18.816
Don't you think so, tim?

15:18.817 --> 15:21.318
I never notice what
she's wearing.

15:23.755 --> 15:26.089
I noticed what jill's wearing.
And it looks lovely on you.

15:26.090 --> 15:29.960
Thank you, sweetie.
It is gonna be so great
to have you living nearby.

15:29.961 --> 15:32.930
You know, tim and I can
baby-sit for you any time.
<i>(nancy)</i> great.

15:32.931 --> 15:34.932
They're gonna be walking
and talking soon.

15:34.933 --> 15:37.267
I know. I can't believe
they're almost a year old.

15:37.268 --> 15:39.837
Seems like just yesterday
you were pregnant.

15:39.838 --> 15:42.139
I still remember the time
you drove up to saginaw

15:42.140 --> 15:44.608
And surprised nancy
during her shower.

15:49.948 --> 15:52.382
You know,
speaking of showers...

15:52.383 --> 15:55.052
Wait a minute.
Isn't that our song?

15:56.988 --> 15:59.557
We don't have a song.
We do now. Let's dance.
Come on.

15:59.558 --> 16:02.392
Nance? Come on.

16:07.532 --> 16:10.200
You ok? You're acting even
stranger than normal.

16:10.201 --> 16:12.502
I'm all right.

16:12.503 --> 16:16.674
You have a problem with nancy?
You seem a little uncomfortable
around her.

16:16.675 --> 16:19.944
I'm not uncomfortable.
Good. 'cause I think
she's great.

16:19.945 --> 16:22.680
The more I see of her,
the more I like her.

16:22.681 --> 16:25.148
Me too.

16:26.618 --> 16:28.218
Hey.
What?

16:28.219 --> 16:29.853
I'm cutting in.

16:29.854 --> 16:31.989
I want to dance with
my beautiful sister-in-law.

16:31.990 --> 16:34.524
Well, what about me?

16:34.525 --> 16:36.727
I'll dance with you
next time.

16:36.728 --> 16:40.130
Come on. In the meantime,
you dance with your beautiful
sister-in-law.

17:00.284 --> 17:02.452
This is ridiculous.

17:02.453 --> 17:05.623
There is so much space
between us we could fit in
another person.

17:05.624 --> 17:06.857
Ok.

17:06.858 --> 17:10.160
Excuse me.
Care to join us?

17:10.161 --> 17:13.163
Hey! I don't go in
for that type of thing.

17:20.771 --> 17:23.473
Tim, I really think it's time
we tell them what happened.

17:23.473 --> 17:25.375
No. It's too late now.

17:25.376 --> 17:27.377
If we wanted to tell 'em,
we should've told 'em
right away.

17:27.377 --> 17:29.346
I wanted to tell them,
but you talked me out of it.

17:29.347 --> 17:30.948
Ok, ok, I agree.

17:30.949 --> 17:34.618
Next time we see each other
naked, we tell 'em right away.

17:34.619 --> 17:37.587
Boy, that was fun.
What a dancer!

17:37.588 --> 17:40.457
Let's eat.
Oh. Ok.

17:43.928 --> 17:46.096
Well, ok, so what
are we having?
What have we got?

17:46.097 --> 17:48.331
Lots of good choices here.

17:50.368 --> 17:53.370
I think there's something
tim and I should share.

17:53.371 --> 17:56.206
Chicken and ribs!
How about that, huh?

17:56.207 --> 17:58.575
I could have the ribs,
you have the chicken.
That works out.

17:58.576 --> 18:00.377
We'll do it that way.
That's good.

18:00.378 --> 18:03.580
That's not what
I wanted to share.
Well, uh...

18:03.581 --> 18:07.151
Liver and onions.
I'll take all the onions,
you know I like onions.

18:07.152 --> 18:09.153
Shouldn't have too many of them,
though, 'cause onions are...

18:09.154 --> 18:11.155
Well, they, you know.

18:11.156 --> 18:13.157
No.

18:13.158 --> 18:15.659
The specials, of course.
Mike, what are the specials?

18:15.660 --> 18:18.862
All-beef wieners.
Your choice of buns.

The whole thing was totally
innocent.

19:00.338 --> 19:04.942
Sure, to you

19:04.943 --> 19:07.211
Marty, it was an accident, ok?

19:07.212 --> 19:12.850
It was like the first time
that guy buddha sold
his first naked cheese.

19:15.453 --> 19:18.922
How can you feel anything
but pity for a man like this?

19:18.923 --> 19:22.425

that you saw my wife

Can you believe marty?
He's the most immature guy
I've ever met.

19:39.277 --> 19:41.311
No. That would be the guy

19:41.312 --> 19:45.249
Who thought a fair trade
would be to see his wife naked.

19:45.250 --> 19:48.551
I was just doing that
to calm him down.
Nobody wants to see you naked.

19:51.555 --> 19:53.556
Thank you so much.

19:53.557 --> 19:58.428
I'm sorry. What I meant was,
other than me, nobody wants
to see you naked.

19:58.429 --> 20:01.298
Look, it didn't bother me
that you saw nancy naked.

20:01.299 --> 20:04.034
I just don't understand
why you didn't tell me
about it.

20:04.035 --> 20:08.071
Nancy didn't think
it would be a good idea.

20:08.072 --> 20:11.975
And so that's why she was
the one that brought it
up at dinner?

20:11.976 --> 20:15.078
She's a very
complicated woman.

20:15.079 --> 20:18.715
Admit it. You didn't tell me
about it because you liked
what you saw.

20:18.716 --> 20:20.918
I didn't like it.

20:22.086 --> 20:24.688
I didn't hate it.

20:24.689 --> 20:29.659
You liked what you saw
and you felt a little
guilty about it.

20:29.660 --> 20:32.796
No. I felt real
guilty about it.

20:32.797 --> 20:35.866
That's good.
It proves one thing:
I've trained you well.

20:35.867 --> 20:37.868
And even though it was
an accident, you feel guilty.

20:37.869 --> 20:39.636
That's good. I like it.

20:39.637 --> 20:41.839
This is pathetic.
Because of you,

20:41.840 --> 20:44.641
I can't even enjoy
the sight of another
naked woman.

20:44.642 --> 20:47.978
That is the nicest thing
you ever said to me.

20:49.180 --> 20:51.181
Well, I meant every word
of it.

remember what she looked like.

20:53.918 --> 20:55.685
Yeah, right.

Besides, I do remember
why I went into the shower
to begin with.
