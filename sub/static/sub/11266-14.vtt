00:02.085 --> 00:04.212
Previously on 90210...
I was thinking we could go
on a yoga retreat.

00:04.254 --> 00:06.089
It's run
by this super-famous guru,

00:06.131 --> 00:07.842
Guru Sona.

00:07.883 --> 00:09.301
What are you doing here?
I'm just hanging out with Dixon.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.678
Doesn't matter.

00:12.304 --> 00:13.430
I want to keep seeing you,

00:13.472 --> 00:15.265
but I'm not ready
for everyone to know I'm...

00:15.307 --> 00:16.517
Gay?

00:19.812 --> 00:22.314
You just saved my life.

MAN (on phone): Now, if you were
trying to get your baby back,

00:24.441 --> 00:26.443
that would be a big story.

00:26.485 --> 00:30.280
Well, I am trying.
I want to get my baby back.

00:30.322 --> 00:31.406
I want to keep seeing you,

to sneak around.

I've recently come
into a lot of money.

00:36.996 --> 00:38.121
I'd like to make a
difference in the world.

00:38.163 --> 00:39.122
You're on a very
spiritual path.

00:39.164 --> 00:40.791
I really feel like
I've had some realizations,

00:40.833 --> 00:42.960

with a ruined reputation.
I mean, there's no way...

02:00.996 --> 02:02.330
There's no way.
Exactly. I mean,

02:02.372 --> 02:04.041
when she finds out, she's
going to be devastated,

02:04.083 --> 02:05.709
and if you break up
with her on top of that,

02:05.751 --> 02:07.836
she'd fall apart.

02:07.878 --> 02:10.380
I don't know.
I think Ade's

02:10.422 --> 02:11.799
a lot stronger
than we make her out to be.

Your leaves?

Shedding leaves

05:38.255 --> 05:39.506

Run lines.

choice, do I?

sooner rather than later.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.199

09:10.591 --> 09:12.052
No, it's not something
you've learned.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.220
It's something
that's inside you.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.263

09:15.305 --> 09:16.431
What?

09:16.473 --> 09:17.724

09:17.765 --> 09:19.351
I think you're
ready to hear this.

09:22.479 --> 09:26.233
You're a special person, Naomi,
and by that, I don't just mean

09:26.274 --> 09:28.776
that you're adventurous

wasn't great, huh?

30:42.758 --> 30:43.967
(groans)

30:44.009 --> 30:45.552

30:45.594 --> 30:47.680

a plane crashing

30:47.721 --> 30:49.222
into the train wreck
and then picture

30:49.264 --> 30:51.767
a bird flying
overhead of the wreck

30:51.809 --> 30:54.894
and taking a giant crap on it,
and that was me onstage.

30:54.936 --> 30:56.271
Oh, it couldn't
have been that bad.

30:56.313 --> 30:57.397
(chuckling)
It was.

30:57.439 --> 30:58.940
I had to start
over three times.

30:58.982 --> 31:01.276
Okay, when you finally
got through it,

31:01.318 --> 31:02.569
how was it?

31:02.611 --> 31:04.279
I guess it was okay.

31:04.321 --> 31:06.239
Well, you know what they say
when a bird craps on you.

31:06.281 --> 31:07.407
Hmm?

31:07.449 --> 31:08.742
It's good luck.
Oh...

31:40.566 --> 31:43.151

with this party

31:43.193 --> 31:45.237
and the land you donated.

31:45.278 --> 31:47.947
I decided to donate the
money for the new buildings.

31:47.989 --> 31:49.449
That's wonderful, Sunbeam.

31:49.491 --> 31:50.701

31:50.743 --> 31:53.704
Well, it's my
obligation, really.

31:53.746 --> 31:55.622
'Cause Guru Sona's

31:55.664 --> 31:58.250
Yeah. And because...

31:58.291 --> 32:00.627

going to be part

32:00.669 --> 32:03.255

for a long time.

32:03.296 --> 32:05.298
Can I tell you something

32:05.340 --> 32:06.800
I don't think I'm
supposed to tell anyone?

32:06.842 --> 32:08.134
Oh, sure.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.470
Guru Sona told me

32:10.512 --> 32:13.724
that I'm on a higher spiritual
plane than most people.

32:13.766 --> 32:17.728
I'm what they call
the Golden Fruit.

32:17.770 --> 32:20.063
That means
"the chosen one."

32:20.105 --> 32:22.190
I'm like your
spiritual leader.

32:22.232 --> 32:24.860
(chuckles politely)

32:26.528 --> 32:29.782
Okay, these shrimp are the bomb.

32:29.823 --> 32:32.659
I'm, like, not somebody
who says "the bomb,"

32:32.701 --> 32:33.827
but these shrimp
help me understand

32:33.869 --> 32:34.994
why people say "the bomb."

32:35.036 --> 32:36.955
Mmm!

32:40.125 --> 32:41.293
What?

32:41.334 --> 32:42.419
Does your mother
not feed you?

32:42.461 --> 32:44.087
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Leave her alone.

32:44.129 --> 32:45.422
She probably
worked up an appetite

32:45.464 --> 32:48.007
winning the surf competition.
Yeah.

32:48.049 --> 32:49.802
That's no excuse to
bogart all the shrimp.

32:49.843 --> 32:51.136
They're made of soy.

32:51.177 --> 32:52.178
Dude, they're bogus shrimp.

32:52.220 --> 32:53.639
This is soy
dressed up as shrimp?

32:53.680 --> 32:56.475
(chortling):
That is genius.

32:56.516 --> 32:58.143
ADRIANNA:

Whoa.

33:23.961 --> 33:26.087
Gay?
Yes.

33:26.129 --> 33:27.297
Yeah, but...
Ask questions later.

33:27.339 --> 33:28.548
What...?
Just accept him.

33:28.590 --> 33:29.758
He is your friend.

33:29.800 --> 33:31.718
He's the same Teddy
he's always been.
ADRIANNA: Wow,

33:31.760 --> 33:34.095
my gaydar was
so broken.

33:34.137 --> 33:36.389
Sure you're ready?

33:36.431 --> 33:37.933
Right now, yes.

33:37.975 --> 33:39.977
In about ten seconds,
not so much.

33:40.018 --> 33:40.978
So let's just do it.

33:41.019 --> 33:41.979
Okay.
(clears throat)

33:42.020 --> 33:43.480
No wonder
I never slept with him.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.231
(Teddy clears throat)
Hey.

33:45.273 --> 33:46.483
Hey.
Hey, everyone.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.401

Hey!
There's room for you guys.

33:49.778 --> 33:51.070
You want to...?
Yes, yeah.

33:51.112 --> 33:52.113
Slide over, sit down.

33:52.155 --> 33:53.448
Come on.

33:53.490 --> 33:56.910
(people clearing throats

34:01.665 --> 34:03.416
Yeah.

34:05.585 --> 34:09.464
Well, I know this might
be kind of a big surprise

34:09.505 --> 34:11.800

but, um,

34:11.842 --> 34:12.926
I'm gay.

34:20.141 --> 34:21.768
Oh, yeah, she had, she had
a big, uh, surf competition,

34:21.810 --> 34:24.603
uh, wore herself out, so
she's either that or...

34:24.646 --> 34:27.190

blowing up at you.

It's okay.

34:33.947 --> 34:35.991
I'm sorry

34:36.033 --> 34:38.493
Don't worry about it.

34:45.375 --> 34:49.588
(applause)

34:49.629 --> 34:51.590
Excuse me.

34:51.630 --> 34:55.092
Everyone, hi, I just wanted
to say a few words.

34:55.134 --> 34:57.637
When I met Guru Sona,

34:57.679 --> 34:59.639
I was
in a really bad place.

34:59.681 --> 35:01.349
I was living out of fear.

35:01.391 --> 35:03.769
I could not see clearly,

35:03.810 --> 35:07.397
but now, thanks to her,

35:07.439 --> 35:09.775
I can.

35:09.816 --> 35:14.071
I can see just what a phony
she really is.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.488
You knew
I was weak

35:15.530 --> 35:17.198
and you used me.

35:17.240 --> 35:18.366
Well, I'm not
weak anymore,

35:18.408 --> 35:19.367
but you,

35:19.409 --> 35:20.493
Guru Sona,

35:20.535 --> 35:21.703
are a con artist,

35:21.745 --> 35:23.371
so you can take
your mantras

35:23.413 --> 35:25.916
and your yoga
and your Shining Tree of Life

35:25.958 --> 35:27.417
and shove it up your ashram.

35:27.459 --> 35:30.045
And by the way, kombucha is
made of bacteria and yeast.

35:30.087 --> 35:31.170
It's okay.

35:31.212 --> 35:32.380
She's troubled,
she needs to talk.

35:32.422 --> 35:34.049
You better believe
I'm troubled.

35:34.091 --> 35:35.508
I want my money back.

35:35.550 --> 35:38.887
Oh, I'm, I'm sorry, Naomi,
but you already signed the deed

35:38.929 --> 35:39.888
to my foundation.

35:39.930 --> 35:41.681
Like it or not,
that land is mine.

35:41.723 --> 35:42.682
N-N-No, you can't take my money.

35:42.724 --> 35:43.725
You're a liar
and a criminal.

35:43.767 --> 35:45.894
That's right, Naomi, let
all these feelings out.

35:45.936 --> 35:47.020

of your spiritual journey.

35:49.564 --> 35:50.774
