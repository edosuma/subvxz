<i>Some people

00:17.059 --> 00:20.604
<i>But me, I was destined for disaster.</i>

00:21.104 --> 00:23.106
<i>That was the story of my life.</i>

00:23.190 --> 00:26.401
<i>Only I would get kidnapped
in the middle of a kidnapping.</i>

00:27.778 --> 00:30.489
<i>Last thing I remembered,
I was zapping Roxy,</i>

00:30.989 --> 00:32.658
<i>and then I blacked out.</i>

00:33.116 --> 00:34.618
<i>It had to be Christian.</i>

00:34.701 --> 00:36.328
<i>He abducted that girl in Brazil.</i>

00:36.745 --> 00:37.829
<i>Who else could it be?</i>

00:44.711 --> 00:46.004
Stella Rose?

00:46.380 --> 00:47.214
Roxy?

00:47.589 --> 00:48.590
<i>Hola.</i>

00:49.800 --> 00:52.010
- Why would you?
- What? Kidnap you?

00:52.427 --> 00:54.096
Why were you gonna kidnap Roxy?

00:56.014 --> 01:00.519
Because I was worried
she was gonna beat me at Regionals.

01:00.852 --> 01:03.188
If that's what this is about,
I'll drop out. I promise.

01:03.272 --> 01:06.567
Oh, you think I'm threatened by you?
Dream on.

01:06.650 --> 01:07.818
Then why?

01:07.901 --> 01:09.528
Bob Armstrong.

01:10.821 --> 01:12.239
He doesn't coach me anymore.

01:12.573 --> 01:13.782
He coaches her.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.160
Not when we get through with him.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.580
Let me go. You'll get caught.

01:19.663 --> 01:22.332
You'll go to jail.
- No.You'll go to jail.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.502
You stole the truck,
you tried to abduct Roxy,

01:26.086 --> 01:27.170
and I've got the proof.

01:28.171 --> 01:31.091
I still can't believe you let her
do that to me. It hurt like a bitch.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.676
Well, I had to make it look authentic.

01:33.385 --> 01:34.219
Help!

01:34.845 --> 01:37.264
- Help! Help!
- Ah, I knew we should have gagged her.

01:37.347 --> 01:40.350
I've been kidnapped
by two crazy bitches. Help!

01:41.226 --> 01:42.936
Help! Ow! Ow!

01:45.480 --> 01:48.191
<i>I couldn't believe
that this was actually happening.</i>

01:48.275 --> 01:50.027
<i>That I might have a threesome</i>

02:20.057 --> 02:21.808
<i>Could we really make a meal of this?</i>

02:22.934 --> 02:25.812
<i>Could the three of us be happy together?</i>

02:27.689 --> 02:28.565
Mom?

02:28.649 --> 02:31.068
I thought he was
at a Drew Barrymore book signing.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.152
That's what he told me.

02:32.235 --> 02:33.695
- Abort! Abort!
- Okay.

02:33.779 --> 02:35.864
If Patty were here, her car would be here.

02:35.947 --> 02:37.491
Uh, maybe my mom knows where she is.

02:38.033 --> 02:38.867
Mom?

02:41.161 --> 02:42.829
- Ooh!
- Hey, Mom...

02:44.498 --> 02:46.041
I didn't hear you come in.

02:46.124 --> 02:47.626
- What's going on?
- What?

02:47.709 --> 02:49.878
I thought you hated Dad
and you wanted Bob dead.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.505
- Oh.
- No.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.924
There's no reason to hold a hold a grudge.

02:54.007 --> 02:58.470
Besides, your father and Bob generously
offered to help me redecorate the bedroom.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.639
- That's right.
- Like I was saying,

03:00.722 --> 03:05.644
I really think wall sconce's will give
the space the oomph that it deserves.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.062
- What do you think, Bob?
- Oh, yeah.

03:07.145 --> 03:12.192
I have so often been known to say
that you can never go wrong with a sconce.

03:12.275 --> 03:13.485
Mmm.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.612
Coralee, have you seen Patty?

03:15.987 --> 03:18.407
- Uh, no. Why?
- Whose underwear are those?

03:18.782 --> 03:20.033
- Mine.
- Mine.

03:20.117 --> 03:20.951
Thanks. Bye.

03:21.118 --> 03:22.744
Oh, no. Wait. Brick.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.622
Brick, we still need to talk.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.375
No, we're fine.
If Mom forgives you, so do I.

03:30.877 --> 03:31.837
Oh, my God.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.131
That was really close.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.757
Do you think he bought it?

03:36.258 --> 03:37.175
Fifty-fifty?

03:38.427 --> 03:39.511
Oh, my God.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.687
- We should tell them Patty's missing.
- No way. We're not going back there.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.606
But it's a huge deal
that Patty missed Drew Barrymore.

03:51.690 --> 03:54.192
That's like you missing
a State Championship wrestling match.

03:54.276 --> 03:57.612
Okay, look, when we spoke to her, she said
she forgot about the book signing,

03:57.696 --> 03:59.906
so maybe... maybe Drew's
not as important to her anymore.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.826
Maybe... maybe she's changed more
than you think.

04:03.952 --> 04:06.621
If she doesn't turn up by morning,
yeah, we freak out.

04:06.872 --> 04:08.957
But until then, go get some sleep.

04:13.503 --> 04:14.463
They're gone.

04:15.130 --> 04:16.089
Phew!

04:16.173 --> 04:17.466
Great. Where were we?

04:18.507 --> 04:21.636
Bob, are you crazy?
Brick could come back at any time.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.556
Well, um, let's get a hotel or...

04:24.973 --> 04:27.517
Or we could just call it a night.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.479
No. Let's... we can't lose the momentum.
Come on.

04:30.562 --> 04:33.690
I know, Bob, but I have
an early appointment tomorrow.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.901
And we gotta get up early in the morning

04:35.984 --> 04:37.903
to talk to Roxy about her hair
for regionals.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.573
So, I guess...

04:41.948 --> 04:43.700
this is goodnight?

04:45.744 --> 04:48.038
<i>I couldn't let this
slip through my fingers.</i>

04:51.124 --> 04:52.918
- You coming?
- I don't know.

04:53.376 --> 04:57.631
I mean, if we're not getting divorced
and we're not breaking up,

04:58.673 --> 04:59.674
where do I sleep?

05:02.344 --> 05:03.553
I'll get a hotel room.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.640
After we coach Roxy,
we can all meet there.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.308
Tomorrow? Yeah? Lunch?

05:08.391 --> 05:09.226
Hmm?

05:10.060 --> 05:11.019
Everyone game?

05:19.778 --> 05:23.240
<i>I had to find a way to get out
to save Bob</i>

05:23.323 --> 05:25.283
<i>and also my ears.</i>

05:25.826 --> 05:27.327
That's beautiful.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.956
Where did you learn to play the harmonica?

05:31.289 --> 05:33.875
It was my talent
when I was a pageant girl.

05:37.045 --> 05:40.090
Speaking of pageant girls, where is Roxy?

05:41.341 --> 05:44.511
She's with Bob Armstrong
getting ready for Regionals.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.389
He'd be suspicious if she didn't show up.

05:52.269 --> 05:53.353
The hell is that?

05:54.312 --> 05:55.897
We're in the middle of nowhere.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.108
If you scream...

05:58.525 --> 06:00.902
I won't. I'll... I'll be quiet and...

06:00.986 --> 06:02.195
No. You don't have to.

06:03.989 --> 06:05.824
<i>I fucking hate that bitch.</i>

06:07.659 --> 06:09.452
What the hell's going on here?

06:10.120 --> 06:11.705
You guys make breakfast tacos?

06:11.788 --> 06:14.833
- We got some hungry hunters out here.
- I wanna eat a taco.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.170
We're closed.

06:19.254 --> 06:20.797
Go hunt your own breakfast.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.299
You can't hunt a wiener.

06:23.091 --> 06:23.925
Help!

06:24.384 --> 06:26.011
Help! I've been kidnapped.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.013
- What the...?
- My daughter. She's mentally ill.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.098
Sh... sh...

06:30.974 --> 06:32.684
Shit.

06:34.436 --> 06:35.270
Bye.

06:36.688 --> 06:37.522
Oh!

06:39.274 --> 06:40.108
Patty!

06:50.327 --> 06:51.453
What the hell's that?

06:53.705 --> 06:54.623
I don't know.

06:54.956 --> 06:55.790
Let's kill it.

06:59.127 --> 06:59.961
Oh, shit.

07:04.049 --> 07:04.883
Got it.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.803
Seriously? I'm a taco.

07:08.887 --> 07:11.264
<i>I had no map, no phone,</i>

07:11.348 --> 07:13.266
<i>just a wienie suit slowing me down.</i>

07:14.059 --> 07:16.353
<i>SeÃ±or Wienie may have saved my life,</i>

07:16.436 --> 07:19.564
<i>but if I was going to save Bob's,
I needed to move faster.</i>

07:28.531 --> 07:30.700
I'm thinking an updo.

07:30.992 --> 07:34.496
It'll show off the neckline of the dress,
and you know what they say,

07:34.579 --> 07:37.791
- "The higher the hair, the closer to God."
- Okay. Hands off.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.668
Bob <i>back seat driver</i> Barnard.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.544
- I am the coach.
- Mm-hmm.

07:41.628 --> 07:45.215
Now, usually, I wouldn't do a butt cut.

07:45.423 --> 07:48.218
It can make your nose look bigger but,

07:49.427 --> 07:50.929
with the shape of that mouth.

07:51.012 --> 07:53.598
- What's wrong with my mouth?
- Oh, nothing, baby. It's perfect.

07:53.682 --> 07:55.141
Yeah. For a porn set.

07:55.558 --> 07:57.102
It has taken over your face

07:57.185 --> 08:01.898
and a middle part might offset
that huge, horizontal line.

08:02.941 --> 08:05.485
- Is he always this bitchy?
- Only when he hasn't eaten.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.487
We need to talk about extensions.

08:07.570 --> 08:09.239
But they are expensive.

08:09.322 --> 08:12.450
I will see if I can pull a favor
at the salon,

08:12.534 --> 08:14.995
and while I'm there,
I will get this steamed.

08:15.620 --> 08:18.540
I will see you at lunch.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.628
No, gotta bring around front.

08:24.379 --> 08:25.255
Dad.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.799
I just got an email
from the Miss Magic Jesus board

08:27.882 --> 08:29.509
and they're reinstating me.

08:29.801 --> 08:33.429
- I am now Co Miss Magic Jesus with Patty.
- Oh, wow. Congrats.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.140
Thanks! I have no idea how this happened.

08:35.222 --> 08:39.184
Well, I called them and told them
it was my fault that you cheated.

08:39.727 --> 08:42.480
I couldn't live with myself
having ruined your reputation.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.274
That's amazing.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.568
Just in time for me
to sign up for Regionals.

08:47.068 --> 08:50.739
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?
- I thought you were done with pageants?

08:50.822 --> 08:54.200
I was, but at rehab I realized

08:54.284 --> 08:57.829
I only wanted out
because you put so much pressure on me.

08:58.163 --> 09:00.790
Now that you're not, it could be fun.

09:01.499 --> 09:04.586
Plus, I miss the girls
and the camaraderie.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.922
The excitement of competition
and that tense moment

09:08.006 --> 09:09.466
right before they announce my name.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.259
- All right, look. Slow down.
- And...

09:11.760 --> 09:14.262
Your therapist said pageants
can be triggering,

09:14.345 --> 09:16.681
and just talking about it
you're getting allÂ amped up.

09:16.765 --> 09:19.017
I'm not amped. I'm excited.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.728
All right. Well, I just...
I just think, for now,

09:21.811 --> 09:23.480
we should focus on your sobriety.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.274
Why? So you can focus on Roxy?

09:28.610 --> 09:30.487
I thought you wanted me
to reach out to her?

09:31.029 --> 09:33.740
If you didn't want me to compete,
then why did you bother to fix this?

09:33.823 --> 09:35.784
Because it was the right thing to do.

09:37.952 --> 09:40.413
I think I liked you better
when you didn't have integrity.

09:40.872 --> 09:41.956
Magnolia...

10:01.184 --> 10:03.144
<i>Can you give me that candy?</i>

10:04.896 --> 10:07.357
What the hell!

10:08.691 --> 10:11.027
You can't just sneak up
on people like that.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.863
And you can't be in Patty's house.
What are you doing here?

10:14.280 --> 10:15.532
Making muffins.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.450
Looks to me like you're squatting.

10:18.076 --> 10:20.036
No, it looks to me like she's standing.

10:20.745 --> 10:23.873
I mean, she's living
inside the empty house, and it's illegal.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.793
Wouldn't be the first time
I broke the law, right Brick?

10:26.876 --> 10:29.671
- You need to go like now.
- But my muffins!

10:29.754 --> 10:30.922
Have you seen Patty?

10:31.381 --> 10:33.967
- She's probably with her boyfriend.
- What boyfriend?

10:34.050 --> 10:36.219
Some guy named Christian.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.388
He left her a gift.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.601
Ooh.

10:43.685 --> 10:44.853
With a card.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.983
"Dear Patty, I love you.

10:50.066 --> 10:53.570
I see the real you
and I'm never letting you go.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.029
Love, Christian."

10:56.281 --> 10:58.366
- Do you think Christian...
- It's time to call your Dad.

10:58.449 --> 11:00.243
So, does that mean
I can wait for my muffins?

11:00.326 --> 11:01.578
- No!
- No!

11:02.120 --> 11:03.371
Whoopsie.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.290
That's cool. I'll just be dirty.

11:07.125 --> 11:11.379
Dad, why aren't you answering your phone?
You didn't pick up, I called the deputy.

11:11.462 --> 11:14.382
- He said you'd be here.
- What's the emergency? Everything okay?

11:14.465 --> 11:15.341
No.

11:15.884 --> 11:19.012
Patty's missing. We think
her psycho ex-boyfriend abducted her.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.472
Nonnie, this is Patty we're talking about.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.100
You told me yourself
she's been acting crazy.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.227
Heard anything?
My dad is totally freaking out.

11:26.728 --> 11:29.355
No. Guys just checked Swallow Creek.
It's already gone.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.524
- What happened?
- Somebody stole the Weenmobile.

11:32.442 --> 11:34.569
It's supposed to be
at the Schwarz Bar Mitzvah, see?

11:34.652 --> 11:36.946
But this came up about an hour ago.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.032
I have no idea who could've taken it.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.827
That's Patty's handwriting.

11:44.078 --> 11:47.040
Oh, my God.
What if she stole the truck?

11:47.457 --> 11:48.374
Why would she do that?

11:49.459 --> 11:50.752
Regionals are coming up

11:50.835 --> 11:53.421
and she goes crazy when she's stressed.

11:53.504 --> 11:55.089
So if she stole the Weenmobile,

11:55.173 --> 11:57.091
she's probably binge eating
everything inside.

11:57.175 --> 11:59.260
Good news is
we don't have to save her from Christian.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.220
No.

12:00.595 --> 12:02.388
We have to save her from herself.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.683
Dad. Put out a BOLO on the Weenmobile.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.483
<i>I had to recapture
the magic of the night before.</i>

12:13.942 --> 12:16.903
<i>If I could have them both,
I wouldn't have to choose,</i>

12:16.986 --> 12:20.156
<i>and that was the only way
I could truly be happy.</i>

12:28.122 --> 12:29.374
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.335
Wow, Bob.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.671
You really outdid yourself.

12:34.837 --> 12:37.257
Well, I wanted things to be perfect.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.217
This is unchartered territory, so...

12:41.135 --> 12:42.095
Um...

12:42.178 --> 12:43.221
What... what's that?

12:44.514 --> 12:46.349
I'm not sure, but...

12:47.100 --> 12:48.142
it looks effective.

12:48.226 --> 12:50.061
I thought it best to have toys

12:50.144 --> 12:53.314
in case two of us are busy
and the other one is...

12:53.398 --> 12:54.232
Oh.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.235
Okay, Bob, I don't think I can do this.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.946
What? No. Okay, look, fine, we'll lose it.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.115
See? Putting it away.

13:09.872 --> 13:10.707
Sorry.

13:11.082 --> 13:15.169
No, it's not just whatever that is,
it's just the whole... the whole thing.

13:15.253 --> 13:16.504
I'm... I'm just not sure

13:16.587 --> 13:19.590
I'm the type of person
that can have a three-way.

13:19.674 --> 13:21.592
Wait. No. This was your idea.

13:21.676 --> 13:23.678
I know, I know, but that was last night.

13:23.761 --> 13:25.805
I got super caught up in the moment and...

13:25.888 --> 13:27.849
you know, I got to admit,
it was kind of hot

13:27.932 --> 13:29.976
seeing the two of you make out, okay,

13:30.059 --> 13:31.519
but it feels kind of dirty.

13:31.602 --> 13:33.438
Oh, no. Look.

13:38.401 --> 13:41.487
This is about more than sex for me.

13:41.946 --> 13:46.576
I want us to be together like a couple,
but... but all three.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.829
Like a... aÂ thruple?

13:49.912 --> 13:50.788
Yeah. That.

13:50.872 --> 13:53.708
Oh, I don't know, Bob,
that seems kind of out there.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.085
But... that doesn't mean it's a bad idea.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.923
I wanna be able to stay with you,

14:01.549 --> 14:04.218
but I don't wanna feel
there's this part of me

14:04.302 --> 14:06.095
that's always longing for more.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.890
Yeah, but... I don't need more.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.684
I'm happy with just you.

14:13.728 --> 14:15.646
I thought I didn't need more either...

14:16.647 --> 14:18.191
and then Bob kissed me.

14:19.442 --> 14:24.030
What if it's everything you never knew
you always wanted.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.461
Oh, hey, what's wrong?

14:39.128 --> 14:40.004
Uh...

14:40.088 --> 14:41.381
I got into a fight...

14:42.006 --> 14:43.132
with Magnolia.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.301
Oh, sweetheart, sit down.

14:46.511 --> 14:47.929
Do you wanna talk about it?

14:49.263 --> 14:50.723
I'm trying to do the right thing,

14:50.807 --> 14:53.309
but I feel like
I just keep screwing it all up.

14:54.435 --> 14:55.853
I feel like a failure.

14:59.023 --> 15:03.111
I mean, if you're a failure,
then there's no hope for the rest of us.

15:05.029 --> 15:08.866
Bob, ever since I first met you,
I've wanted your life.

15:09.700 --> 15:10.827
We both have.

15:13.204 --> 15:14.038
Really?

15:16.124 --> 15:17.875
'Cause I always wanted yours.

15:20.253 --> 15:24.424
The two of you, you have something
Etta Mae and I never had.

15:26.509 --> 15:28.136
A real marriage.

15:29.846 --> 15:31.639
Real intimacy.

15:34.976 --> 15:36.144
I want this.

15:40.481 --> 15:41.649
This is right here.

15:45.528 --> 15:46.404
What do you mean?

15:51.367 --> 15:52.201
Maybe...

15:53.244 --> 15:54.370
what we have...

15:55.538 --> 15:56.622
we can share.

16:39.207 --> 16:41.751
<i>Bob was screwed because of me.</i>

16:42.126 --> 16:45.004
<i>There was no way to warn him
about Roxy and Stella Rose.</i>

16:45.087 --> 16:47.798
<i>Not a single car had passed in two hours.</i>

16:48.382 --> 16:51.010
<i>But wait, was my luck turning around?</i>

16:51.260 --> 16:53.804
<i>Was something good
finally going to happen?</i>

16:54.764 --> 16:55.932
Shit.

16:56.641 --> 16:58.684
Amazing what you can pick up at Walmart.

16:59.268 --> 17:01.354
Oh, I got handcuffs too.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.731
Hope purple doesn't make you look fat.

17:04.232 --> 17:05.107
Now get in.

17:17.118 --> 17:18.119
What?

17:18.454 --> 17:19.329
Oh.

17:19.413 --> 17:20.998
Aren't you Dixie's mom?

17:21.082 --> 17:22.959
Yes, I am, hotsicle.

17:23.626 --> 17:26.045
Give a lady a hand.

17:26.921 --> 17:28.130
Ooh. Why?

17:28.631 --> 17:29.924
How can I help you?

17:30.341 --> 17:32.009
I'm looking for Patty Bladell.

17:32.093 --> 17:33.010
Well...

17:33.427 --> 17:35.555
you upgraded and...

17:36.430 --> 17:38.182
I happen to have a thing...

17:38.933 --> 17:40.393
for younger men.

17:43.646 --> 17:47.066
- Hey, that's my girlfriends bracelet.
- No, it's mine.

17:47.149 --> 17:50.361
Bullshit. It has a GPS tracking chip
that I used to find her here.

17:50.444 --> 17:53.906
That is pretty intense
Stalker, Texas Ranger.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.324
I'm not a stalker.

17:56.033 --> 17:59.745
I need to know where she is at all times,
at least until she takes me back.

17:59.829 --> 18:01.831
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm not judging.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.082
Everyone has their quirks.

18:03.624 --> 18:06.127
You stalk, I'm a terrible person.

18:06.210 --> 18:10.673
Plus, I appreciate someone
who won't take no for an answer.

18:11.257 --> 18:14.385
But I'm telling you,
you're going about this the wrong way.

18:14.844 --> 18:15.720
What do you mean?

18:15.803 --> 18:18.347
Winners win at any cost.

18:18.806 --> 18:21.767
You need to be willling to go
to an alliance to get what you want.

18:21.851 --> 18:24.353
Hello. I tried putting
a tracking device on her.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.314
I'm pretty sure
that's going to any lengths.

18:26.397 --> 18:29.900
You're sitting on the sidelines.
You need to get in the game, son.

18:29.984 --> 18:32.903
You need a grand, romantic gesture.

18:32.987 --> 18:35.656
Oh, like the boom box in <i>Say Anything.</i>

18:36.365 --> 18:37.199
Look...

18:37.700 --> 18:42.288
just figure out what Patty wants
more than anything in the world

18:42.663 --> 18:45.958
and you figure a way to give it to her.

18:46.042 --> 18:49.337
Can't believe I'm taking life tips
from someone who lives in a cardboard box,

18:49.420 --> 18:51.839
but good advice is good advice.

18:51.922 --> 18:54.717
I can't believe baby Jesus
sent me a hot teen werewolf, so...

18:58.888 --> 19:02.850
<i>I have been kidnapped
by the same people twice in one day.</i>

19:02.933 --> 19:05.394
<i>It was a perfect metaphor for my life.</i>

19:05.478 --> 19:09.815
<i>Every time I thought I made progress,
I ended up in exactly the same spot.</i>

19:09.899 --> 19:12.068
Don't count on those hunters
coming to your rescue.

19:12.443 --> 19:15.112
After your litle stunt,
we moved this truck so far away

19:15.196 --> 19:17.531
even my bloodhounds
couldn't sniff you out.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.743
She's not going anywhere.

19:21.369 --> 19:24.163
Let's go, Momma.
Time to lower the boom on Bob.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.831
Why are you helping her?

19:25.915 --> 19:27.375
What did Bob ever do to you?

19:27.458 --> 19:29.460
Other than being the reason
I grew up in foster care?

19:30.378 --> 19:32.004
What did he have to do with that?

19:32.505 --> 19:36.926
I was too devastated over losing him
to raise a child.

19:37.301 --> 19:39.178
Because you got dumped?

19:40.012 --> 19:42.181
Wow, you're crazier than you look.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.016
I'm not crazy.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.188
Another text from Nonnie.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.524
She and a guy named Christian
have sent her like a million.

19:51.607 --> 19:54.360
Text her back. If she don't answer,
they'll get suspicious.

19:57.446 --> 20:00.157
"Sorry I ghosted.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.451
Laying low.

20:03.160 --> 20:06.831
Freaking out about the competition."

20:09.625 --> 20:13.546
Later loser. Next time I see you,
I'll have a crown on my head.

20:28.436 --> 20:31.439
<i>I thought if I lost weight,
I'd have a fresh start.</i>

20:31.731 --> 20:34.608
<i>If people liked me, if I had a boyfriend,</i>

20:34.692 --> 20:35.943
<i>if I got the crown,</i>

20:36.360 --> 20:37.778
<i>but none of it mattered.</i>

20:37.862 --> 20:40.156
<i>It was always the same story,</i>

20:40.489 --> 20:44.076
<i>which meant I couldn't save Bob
and I couldn't save myself.</i>

20:44.869 --> 20:45.911
<i>Roxy was right.</i>

20:46.245 --> 20:47.496
<i>I was a loser.</i>

20:47.872 --> 20:48.873
<i>Always had been.</i>

20:49.707 --> 20:51.917
<i>Call it a curse. Call it bad luck.</i>

20:52.126 --> 20:53.210
<i>Call it fate.</i>

20:53.586 --> 20:55.838
<i>No wonder bad things kept happening to me.</i>

20:56.380 --> 20:58.257
<i>Bladell women never win.</i>

21:06.849 --> 21:09.185
Hey. I need you to hook me up.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.020
Why? I heard you got clean.

21:11.395 --> 21:12.271
I did.

21:12.354 --> 21:13.606
I mean, I am.

21:15.900 --> 21:20.529
My dad won't let me compete at Regionals
because he thinks pageants are a trigger.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.281
You know what's really a trigger?

21:22.740 --> 21:25.868
Him letting my secret half-sister
be in pageants instead of me.

21:27.453 --> 21:31.207
I wanted him to make things right
with her, not replace me with her.

21:31.999 --> 21:35.085
Fuck him.
He's clearly doing what he wants to do.

21:35.878 --> 21:36.712
Why don't you?

21:38.798 --> 21:39.632
You're right.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.468
I'm gonna go over to registration,

21:42.551 --> 21:44.178
I'm gonna sign up for Regionals,

21:44.261 --> 21:46.514
and I'm gonna kick Roxy's ass.

21:48.057 --> 21:49.767
You sound pretty sure of yourself.

21:50.267 --> 21:51.977
Not worried about the competition?

21:52.728 --> 21:54.772
I am the competition.

21:56.065 --> 21:57.399
I've never lost a pageant,

21:58.150 --> 21:59.026
and I never will.

22:00.861 --> 22:02.279
Need a ride to registration?

22:06.200 --> 22:09.578
<i>I had spent so much
of my life feeling like a loser,</i>

22:09.870 --> 22:13.624
<i>but that day,
I felt like I had won at life.</i>

22:14.041 --> 22:15.084
<i>We had the cake.</i>

22:15.584 --> 22:16.585
<i>We ate it,</i>

22:16.836 --> 22:18.712
<i>and it was more than just sex.</i>

22:18.796 --> 22:21.131
<i>We had shared real intimacy.</i>

22:27.930 --> 22:29.932
- Oh, no, no.
- No.

22:30.015 --> 22:33.811
You may be able to ignore your dad,
but I can't.

22:34.144 --> 22:35.896
Supposed to have a meeting later.

22:38.232 --> 22:42.361
Something tells me he's gonna strip me
of my senior partnership.

22:43.070 --> 22:44.113
I gotta go.

22:44.738 --> 22:46.740
Try not to have too much fun without me.

22:53.706 --> 22:54.999
So?

22:56.083 --> 22:57.042
What do you think?

22:59.044 --> 22:59.879
Well...

23:01.797 --> 23:02.798
it was weird,

23:03.757 --> 23:04.675
and crazy,

23:06.010 --> 23:10.389
and there were a lot of arms, and legs,
and beards.

23:10.973 --> 23:12.558
But did you like it?

23:16.312 --> 23:17.271
I loved it.

23:21.483 --> 23:25.779
Maybe it was everything
I never knew I always wanted.

23:35.289 --> 23:38.417
Who knew this would be the next phase
in our marriage.

23:39.084 --> 23:41.587
- A thruple?
- I know.

23:41.670 --> 23:44.298
There's so much to work out.
Where we're gonna live.

23:44.381 --> 23:46.342
What we tell the kids.

23:47.176 --> 23:48.218
Oh, ugh.

23:48.552 --> 23:51.305
Roxy has a huge zit on her face.

23:52.056 --> 23:55.517
I have to do a pre-pageant
skin-tervention asap.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.395
Well, go. We'll catch up later.

24:00.606 --> 24:01.941
Gotta shower first.

24:03.192 --> 24:05.361
Can't have me coaching
looking thoroughly three-wayed.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.278
Bob?

24:09.198 --> 24:10.449
I really do love you.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.077
I really, really love you.

24:17.998 --> 24:20.918
<i>They always say
good things come in threes.</i>

24:21.335 --> 24:23.671
<i>I had Coralee, I had Bob.</i>

24:24.129 --> 24:27.341
<i>All that was left
was Roxy winning Regionals.</i>

24:29.551 --> 24:30.386
Hi, Bob.

24:31.512 --> 24:33.764
What are you doing here?

24:35.099 --> 24:38.560
Did you really think that Roxy was gonna
leave me for you two hole punchers?

24:38.644 --> 24:40.354
What? I don't understand.

24:40.437 --> 24:42.940
Your services as her coach
are no longer required.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.026
Actually, they never were.

24:46.944 --> 24:47.820
We played you.

24:50.114 --> 24:53.492
I wanted you to think that you were
finally gonna get everything you wanted.

24:53.575 --> 24:56.537
To finally know what it felt like
to be a winner,

24:56.620 --> 24:58.622
coaching a real champion,

24:58.706 --> 25:01.041
only to have it all ripped away...

25:01.917 --> 25:03.335
by me.

25:03.419 --> 25:04.420
That's sick.

25:05.129 --> 25:06.171
You are sick.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.090
Oh, you have no idea.

25:08.674 --> 25:12.511
So, how does it feel
to be left out in the cold?

25:16.932 --> 25:18.225
Actually, it feels fine.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.355
What do you mean, it feels fine?

25:23.689 --> 25:27.401
I just told you
your pageant dreams are over,

25:27.484 --> 25:29.903
and you can't go running back to Patty.

25:30.195 --> 25:31.155
I don't care.

25:33.115 --> 25:36.493
And believe me,
no one is more surprised than me.

25:37.578 --> 25:41.040
Pageants are your drug of choice.
They're the most important thing to you.

25:41.123 --> 25:41.957
I guess...

25:42.916 --> 25:44.418
I guess not any more.

25:49.673 --> 25:50.924
I don't understand.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.134
I know.

25:53.010 --> 25:58.515
You'll never understand what it feels like
to be loved this completely.

25:58.974 --> 26:00.434
To feel this satisfied.

26:01.685 --> 26:03.062
What are you talking about?

26:03.479 --> 26:05.731
Because you think love
is a zero sum game,

26:06.732 --> 26:09.151
and that is why you will always be alone.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.321
Don't you dare judge me...

26:13.113 --> 26:14.948
after everything you put me through.

26:17.201 --> 26:19.036
I will never...

26:19.745 --> 26:21.038
let you be happy.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.625
I will never let you win.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.335
I already have.

26:38.889 --> 26:40.015
Stella Rose...

26:42.684 --> 26:43.602
are you okay?

26:44.186 --> 26:45.270
No, definitely not.

26:46.063 --> 26:48.065
But I will be once I'm through with you.

26:49.817 --> 26:50.859
What are you gonna do?

26:51.652 --> 26:54.279
Well, a bit of a change of plans.

26:54.738 --> 26:56.824
I was just gonna let Bob think
he could have Roxy

26:56.907 --> 26:58.867
and then rip away his pageant dreams,

26:58.951 --> 27:02.121
but I... I had to make sure
he wouldn't go running back to you.

27:02.412 --> 27:05.082
- I-I don't understand.
- And that's why we grabbed you.

27:05.541 --> 27:06.875
Take away his plan B.

27:08.085 --> 27:10.337
But now, I'm gonna make sure

27:10.420 --> 27:14.466
that he is never happy
about anything ever again.

27:14.967 --> 27:15.843
What do you mean?

27:19.221 --> 27:20.305
I'm gonna kill you...

27:21.431 --> 27:24.393
and make it look like
you took yourself out because of him.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.770
I'm gonna rig this hose
to the exhaust pipe.

27:26.854 --> 27:28.313
You'll die of asphyxiation.

27:29.189 --> 27:30.149
You're insane.

27:30.232 --> 27:31.733
You know, I-I-I-I wasn't.

27:32.234 --> 27:35.028
I spent a year in a psycho ward
and I was fine.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.489
But then Bob came back into my life...

27:38.323 --> 27:39.825
because of you, and...

27:42.077 --> 27:42.911
it all just...

27:45.038 --> 27:46.206
came flooding back.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.877
And now he's gotta pay.

27:51.170 --> 27:53.130
Bob will blame himself for your death.

27:54.548 --> 27:55.799
And he'll never get over it.

27:56.466 --> 27:58.177
My best friend, her dad is a cop.

27:58.468 --> 28:00.554
- You'll never get away with this.
- I will.

28:02.139 --> 28:07.561
Because your suicide note
is gonna be very, very convincing.

28:08.228 --> 28:12.316
Now, you make sure you get this verbatim.

28:15.110 --> 28:17.613
"Dear Bob, I thought you loved me..."

28:17.696 --> 28:19.239
Why aren't you writing?

28:19.323 --> 28:20.532
I don't want to.

28:20.991 --> 28:23.577
Do it or I'll put your face in the fryer!

28:33.420 --> 28:34.296
"Dear Bob,

28:36.173 --> 28:37.925
I thought you loved me.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.386
I thought you were my role model,

28:42.137 --> 28:43.722
a father figure

28:45.849 --> 28:48.352
and that maybe one day, even more,

28:48.435 --> 28:49.561
but now I know...

28:51.188 --> 28:52.648
it's never gonna happen...

28:54.441 --> 28:55.901
since you abandoned me.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.111
And I don't blame you

28:59.404 --> 29:01.240
because I'm a loser...

29:02.658 --> 29:05.035
and I don't deserve to live."

29:10.749 --> 29:12.626
What are... what are you doing?

29:13.043 --> 29:14.002
Painting a picture.

29:14.336 --> 29:16.088
Suicide was your last resort,

29:16.922 --> 29:20.968
but first, you turned
to the only friend you ever had.

29:21.885 --> 29:23.262
A fudge weiner.

29:25.597 --> 29:28.934
And when you couldn't numb the feelings
with the food,

29:29.309 --> 29:31.311
you took your own life.

29:32.896 --> 29:34.022
Mmm-mmm.

29:34.106 --> 29:36.692
No, that's not who I am.
That's not who I am anymore.

29:37.234 --> 29:38.193
Bullshit.

29:38.652 --> 29:41.446
You'll always be Fatty Patty.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.156
That's your legacy.

29:48.870 --> 29:51.164
<i>I had never heard it said out loud</i>

29:51.248 --> 29:53.583
<i>or seen it written down all at once.</i>

29:54.501 --> 29:56.545
<i>The suicide note I was writing,</i>

29:56.628 --> 29:58.297
<i>the picture Stella Rose was painting,</i>

29:59.131 --> 30:01.633
<i>that was a story
I'd been told my whole life.</i>

30:04.344 --> 30:05.178
Here.

30:06.722 --> 30:07.723
Enjoy it.

30:07.806 --> 30:08.849
Mmm-mmm.

30:08.932 --> 30:10.934
It'll be your last meal.

30:13.770 --> 30:15.063
<i>Bon appÃ©tit...</i>

30:16.648 --> 30:17.733
Fatty Patty.

30:21.486 --> 30:25.115
<i>But that's when I realized,
it was only true if I believed it.</i>

30:25.866 --> 30:29.578
<i>Bad things would only keep happening to me
if I thought that's what I deserved.</i>

30:37.919 --> 30:40.047
<i>It was time to write my own story.</i>

30:40.547 --> 30:42.799
<i>I wasn't a loser when I was fat,</i>

30:43.216 --> 30:44.760
<i>and I wasn't a loser now.</i>

30:45.635 --> 30:46.595
<i>I was a winner,</i>

30:47.012 --> 30:48.430
<i>and winners win.</i>

30:48.889 --> 30:49.848
<i>Period.</i>

31:11.078 --> 31:13.372
<i>Stella Rose only had it half right.</i>

31:15.165 --> 31:18.877
<i>Food had been my only friend,
but now it saved my life.</i>

31:19.127 --> 31:22.130
<i>Besides, she was the least
of my concerns now.</i>

31:22.381 --> 31:23.548
<i>I was a winner,</i>

31:23.632 --> 31:26.510
<i>and I got to Regionals registration
just in time to prove it.</i>

31:30.347 --> 31:31.973
Hi. Patty Bladell.

31:32.057 --> 31:33.183
Miss Magic Jesus.

31:38.897 --> 31:42.150
Oh, my God, you're alive,

31:42.234 --> 31:43.068
and sticky.

31:43.151 --> 31:44.027
Sorry.

31:44.694 --> 31:46.154
How'd you guys know I would be here?

31:46.238 --> 31:48.198
Nonnie's dad put a BOLO out
on the wiener mobile.

31:48.281 --> 31:50.075
You know, the one that you stole.

31:50.700 --> 31:53.453
I'm sorry. It's a long story.

31:56.706 --> 31:57.999
I can explain more later.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.626
Wait, wait. Where are you going?

31:59.709 --> 32:02.546
Magnolia says she has something
that'll help me win Regionals.

32:02.629 --> 32:04.548
- Why would she want to do that?
- I have no idea.

32:04.631 --> 32:07.759
But at this point,
I could use all the help I can get.

32:08.385 --> 32:10.053
I'm gonna call you later, okay?

32:10.470 --> 32:12.597
But my dad's truck?

32:12.681 --> 32:13.515
Okay.

32:15.892 --> 32:17.310
- Good?
- Mm-hmm.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.312
Ooh!

32:19.396 --> 32:20.230
Uh...

32:20.480 --> 32:21.648
What's all this?

32:21.731 --> 32:25.944
We thought it would be fun
to cook you dinner.

32:26.027 --> 32:29.448
And I have great news.
I got my first investor for Tampazzle.

32:29.531 --> 32:32.159
And how'd it go with my dad.
Are you still senior partner?

32:32.242 --> 32:33.452
I need to talk to you...

32:34.202 --> 32:35.078
alone.

32:37.038 --> 32:37.873
What's up?

32:38.665 --> 32:41.418
Well, it really is
just between you and me, so...

32:41.501 --> 32:42.419
Well...

32:43.211 --> 32:45.672
The only way this is gonna work
for all three of us,

32:45.755 --> 32:49.092
we... we can't keep secrets
from each other anymore.

32:49.176 --> 32:50.469
I-I agree.

32:50.552 --> 32:54.222
I mean, any good relationship
is built on the foundation of trust.

32:54.306 --> 32:57.809
Hold on. What exactly do you guys think
is going on here?

32:58.268 --> 32:59.936
- What?
- What do you mean?

33:00.312 --> 33:04.649
It's what we talked about,
the three of us together, like a thruple.

33:04.733 --> 33:05.775
A what?

33:05.859 --> 33:08.612
Uh, like a couple, but with three.

33:08.695 --> 33:11.281
No, I never agreed
to be in a relationship.

33:11.364 --> 33:13.909
I just figured the three of us
would have sex sometimes

33:13.992 --> 33:15.327
so you didn't feel left out.

33:17.871 --> 33:19.456
So I didn't feel left out?

33:19.539 --> 33:20.999
What... what is wrong with that?

33:21.082 --> 33:25.837
Well, it kind of sounds
like you were taking one for the team.

33:25.921 --> 33:29.966
Well, I told you I was gay emotionally.

33:30.050 --> 33:31.092
Oh, my God.

33:31.176 --> 33:33.345
Oh, my God,
I knew this was a terrible idea.

33:33.428 --> 33:34.596
No, no. It wasn't.

33:34.679 --> 33:36.223
I will not be a sex toy.

33:36.306 --> 33:38.141
- You're not. You weren't. You're not.
- Okay.

33:38.225 --> 33:40.727
And I will not be the third wheel
in my own marriage.

33:40.810 --> 33:42.479
That is not what he is saying.

33:42.562 --> 33:44.272
Well, that is kind of what I'm saying.

33:46.483 --> 33:48.276
No. No. No.

33:48.652 --> 33:52.113
It doesn't work
if it's not all three of us.

33:52.197 --> 33:55.825
For you, Bob, for you.
But it works for me if it's just us.

33:56.326 --> 33:59.621
Look, I just gave up
my entire political career for you.

34:00.121 --> 34:01.331
What are you talking about?

34:01.414 --> 34:03.959
That's what I wanted to tell you
in private.

34:05.460 --> 34:08.755
Your dad said he'd back my campaign
for Mayor,

34:09.214 --> 34:11.550
but only if I broke up with you.

34:12.384 --> 34:13.552
He what?

34:13.717 --> 34:14.553
Yeah.

34:14.969 --> 34:18.514
He said he didn't want his gay son
in the public eye

34:18.598 --> 34:21.016
and that it was a small price to pay

34:21.101 --> 34:23.812
for me to get what I always wanted.

34:24.813 --> 34:28.733
Except what I really always wanted
was you.

34:31.570 --> 34:34.281
I picked you Bob,

34:34.906 --> 34:37.324
and now, I need you to pick me too.

34:39.202 --> 34:41.663
You need me. But...

34:41.746 --> 34:42.789
He's right, Bob.

34:43.873 --> 34:45.708
This isn't fair on either one of us.

34:45.792 --> 34:47.960
No, no, no. But... but you... you said...

34:48.043 --> 34:49.588
I said I would try.

34:49.670 --> 34:52.507
And we barely tried, and it was...

34:54.009 --> 34:55.092
so good.

34:55.176 --> 34:56.261
We... we...

34:56.344 --> 34:57.721
we had fun.

34:57.804 --> 35:00.974
We had great sex. We were connected.

35:01.057 --> 35:02.684
It was... we had everything.

35:06.021 --> 35:06.855
Bob.

35:07.647 --> 35:08.815
It's not gonna work.

35:11.192 --> 35:12.277
It's time to choose.

35:13.194 --> 35:14.279
But...

35:16.156 --> 35:17.157
if I choose,

35:18.700 --> 35:19.951
either way I lose.

35:21.244 --> 35:22.078
Well...

35:23.121 --> 35:25.457
if you don't choose,
you're gonna lose us both.

35:40.889 --> 35:41.806
Magnolia?

35:47.062 --> 35:48.146
Hey, beautiful.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.441
What are you doing here?

35:51.524 --> 35:53.360
I was supposed to meet Magnolia.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.028
I know.

35:56.112 --> 35:56.946
Come here.

36:09.334 --> 36:10.335
Christian?

36:11.878 --> 36:14.339
- What did you do?
- It's a grand, romantic gesture.

36:14.964 --> 36:18.551
You said you were worried about
the competition, so I took care of it.

36:19.052 --> 36:20.804
Magnolia doesn't even do pageants anymore.

36:20.887 --> 36:24.140
She is. She went back
and she never loses. So...

36:29.396 --> 36:30.397
Is she...

36:32.190 --> 36:33.024
dead?

36:33.108 --> 36:36.069
Not yet.
I just roofied her and kidnapped her.

36:36.778 --> 36:38.113
What do you mean, not yet?

36:39.155 --> 36:40.073
I figured...

36:41.449 --> 36:43.034
we could do that part together.

36:46.162 --> 36:48.248
What makes you think that I would ever...

36:48.331 --> 36:50.083
You said you wanted to be a winner,

36:50.417 --> 36:52.502
and winners win at any cost.

36:53.002 --> 36:54.671
I didn't mean this.

36:55.755 --> 36:59.134
- What are you doing?
- What kind of person would kidnap someone?

37:04.806 --> 37:05.640
What?

37:07.934 --> 37:09.144
Me. I-I would.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.354
I would kidnap someone. I tried.

37:11.438 --> 37:12.605
What are you talking about?

37:12.689 --> 37:15.442
I tried. I tried to kidnap Roxy,
my biggest competition.

37:15.525 --> 37:17.485
See? We are the same.

37:17.694 --> 37:21.156
The only thing that stopped me
was that I was kidnapped first.

37:21.531 --> 37:24.284
You... What? How'd you get away?

37:28.788 --> 37:30.206
I did some pretty dark shit.

37:32.667 --> 37:33.501
Great.

37:34.335 --> 37:35.587
So, let's do some more.

37:44.637 --> 37:46.389
- You want me to...
- Kill her.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.476
- No.
- Yes.

37:50.143 --> 37:52.187
You said it yourself. There's no demon.

37:53.146 --> 37:55.023
That everything bad you've ever done,

37:55.607 --> 37:56.649
it's just you.

37:57.859 --> 37:59.402
That doesn't make me a killer.

37:59.486 --> 38:01.780
Why not? We killed that homeless guy.

38:03.865 --> 38:04.824
This isn't the same.

38:04.908 --> 38:06.576
Stop fighting it.

38:07.368 --> 38:08.578
Embrace it.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.079
Be the demon.

38:11.498 --> 38:12.332
Patty?

38:13.458 --> 38:14.709
Patty, what's happening?

38:16.252 --> 38:17.921
<i>I didn't know what was happening.</i>

38:18.004 --> 38:19.881
<i>Could Christian be right about me?</i>

38:20.131 --> 38:23.218
<i>Was this what it meant to be a winner
at any cost?</i>

38:23.843 --> 38:25.929
<i>Maybe I still had my story all wrong.</i>

38:26.429 --> 38:29.474
<i>Maybe I did deserve all the bad things
that happened to me.</i>

38:29.808 --> 38:33.728
<i>Not because I was a loser,
but because I was just bad.</i>

38:34.521 --> 38:36.731
Patty, do it now. She's seen us.
You have to.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.399
- Do what?
- Patty, now.

38:38.775 --> 38:40.068
Do it or I will.

38:40.401 --> 38:41.486
No!

38:42.946 --> 38:43.780
Ow.

38:43.863 --> 38:45.198
Magnolia, run.

38:49.786 --> 38:50.703
You idiot.

38:51.329 --> 38:54.332
She'll go to the police.
We'll both go to jail.

38:54.415 --> 38:55.542
I was protecting her.

38:55.625 --> 38:58.336
You think that makes you what, a hero?

38:58.628 --> 38:59.629
You're the villain.

39:00.380 --> 39:02.549
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

39:03.049 --> 39:06.344
Every time you try to do something good,
you fuck it up.

39:06.427 --> 39:08.972
- That's not true.
- You pushed Dixie off a truck.

39:09.556 --> 39:11.933
- You dumped her out of a wheelchair.
- Stop.

39:12.016 --> 39:12.976
You ruined Bob's life.

39:13.059 --> 39:14.602
- Tried to kidnap Roxy...
- Stop talking.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.104
- And you would have...
- Stop talking.

39:16.187 --> 39:17.021
Face it.

39:17.522 --> 39:18.773
You're a bad person.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.150
I'm a good person! I'm a good person!

39:21.234 --> 39:23.319
- Patty. Stop.
- I'm a good person.

39:23.403 --> 39:24.821
- Patty?
- I'm a good person.

39:24.904 --> 39:26.281
I'm a good person.

39:26.698 --> 39:27.991
I'm a good person.

39:28.575 --> 39:29.701
I'm a good person.

39:30.159 --> 39:31.160
I'm a good person.

39:31.536 --> 39:32.745
I'm a good person.

39:32.829 --> 39:34.372
I'm a good person.

39:34.455 --> 39:35.748
I'm a good person.

39:51.973 --> 39:54.976
<i>They had asked me
to choose, but how could I?</i>

39:55.518 --> 39:58.396
<i>For me, it was an impossible choice.</i>

39:58.730 --> 40:00.940
<i>I had tasted true happiness, and then...</i>

40:01.649 --> 40:02.984
<i>poof, it was gone.</i>

40:03.484 --> 40:04.736
<i>And now I had nothing.</i>

40:05.570 --> 40:08.031
<i>No pageant winner, no Bob,</i>

40:08.489 --> 40:09.574
<i>no Coralee.</i>

40:10.283 --> 40:11.993
<i>I was destined to die alone.</i>

40:21.961 --> 40:25.131
<i>But Patty Bladell had other plans.</i>

40:40.563 --> 40:43.733
Thank you for coming. I'm so sorry,
I didn't know who else to call.

40:44.567 --> 40:45.777
Patty, what happened?

40:51.282 --> 40:52.325
Oh, my God!

40:54.327 --> 40:57.455
Okay. Please. Bob, you have to help me.

41:02.877 --> 41:06.714
Tell me exactly what happened.

41:12.929 --> 41:15.556
We are not calling the police. We can't.

41:15.640 --> 41:18.351
Why not? It was self-defense.
He was dangerous.

41:18.434 --> 41:21.938
Only after the first few blows.
You must have hit him, like, 37 times.

41:22.271 --> 41:23.147
Oh, my God.

41:24.107 --> 41:25.483
You think I'm a murderer.

41:25.566 --> 41:26.859
No, I didn't say that.

41:26.943 --> 41:28.444
I'm a bad person. I am a bad person.

41:28.528 --> 41:30.947
- I'm... I'm worse than bad.
- Patty? Calm down.

41:31.030 --> 41:33.366
I don't even know why you're here.
I ruined your life.

41:33.449 --> 41:34.826
'Cause you also saved it.

41:37.954 --> 41:39.414
What are you talking about?

41:42.875 --> 41:46.254
I was gonna kill myself
when you called tonight.

41:46.587 --> 41:47.672
Oh, my God. Bob.

41:47.755 --> 41:50.633
And it is the second time it has happened.

41:51.384 --> 41:54.053
The first time, when you called
to say you wanted to do pageants,

41:54.137 --> 41:56.180
I had a gun in my mouth then, too.

41:57.932 --> 41:59.851
I never much believed in destiny,

42:01.477 --> 42:03.479
but I am starting to think you and I,

42:04.981 --> 42:06.065
we're fated.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.236
I feel that way too.

42:11.654 --> 42:13.156
You saved my life.

42:14.240 --> 42:15.074
Twice.

42:16.034 --> 42:18.161
Now I am going to save yours.

42:20.121 --> 42:21.205
Whoa, whoa!

42:21.914 --> 42:23.041
Take off your clothes.

42:24.375 --> 42:25.209
Now?

42:26.169 --> 42:28.212
Is this some kind of turn on for you?

42:28.296 --> 42:30.715
No, they are covered in blood.
We gotta get rid of 'em.

42:30.798 --> 42:33.009
Come. I've got something
you can wear in the car.

43:18.805 --> 43:20.056
What the fuck?

43:20.807 --> 43:24.018
What the fuck?

43:24.102 --> 43:25.728
Stop screaming. Someone might hear you.

43:27.897 --> 43:30.650
This has been the worst day ever!

43:30.733 --> 43:32.860
I tell you, I should have killed myself!

43:33.236 --> 43:37.240
Otherwise what else
could possibly go wrong?

43:40.201 --> 43:41.035
Well...

43:44.789 --> 43:46.707
I may have...

43:48.209 --> 43:49.085
also...

43:49.961 --> 43:50.962
sort of...

43:51.796 --> 43:53.172
killed Stella Rose.
