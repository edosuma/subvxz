14:38.834 --> 14:41.489
DO THE MAZE.

14:41.532 --> 14:42.838
GREAT TO SEE YOU.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.014
BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW HARD IT WAS FOR ME

14:45.058 --> 14:46.929
TO GET THESE KIDS INTERESTED
IN CHRISTIANITY?

14:46.973 --> 14:48.800
I HAD TO TELL 'EM THE APOSTLES
WERE THE ORIGINAL ONE DIRECTION,

14:48.844 --> 14:50.150
AND THEY BARELY BOUGHT IT.

14:50.193 --> 14:51.934
OKAY, WELL, I DON'T THINK
IT WAS VERY COOL OF YOU

14:51.978 --> 14:54.937
TO ASK ME TO CONVERT.

14:54.981 --> 14:57.897
I SHOULD--I SHOULD GET BACK
TO MY CLASS.

14:57.940 --> 15:00.247
OKAY?
OKAY.

15:00.290 --> 15:03.337
GREAT, PASTOR CASEY.
GET BACK TO YOUR CLASS.

15:03.380 --> 15:05.208
I'M IN PASTOR MODE.YEAH.

15:05.252 --> 15:06.949
AND KICK ME OUT OF THIS PLACE
OF WELCOMING.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.864
MINDY.
HOPEFULLY
THEY'LL HAVE MORE

15:08.908 --> 15:10.344
OF A CHRISTIAN ATTITUDE
AT THE TRIATHLON.

15:10.387 --> 15:13.477
DANNY, YOU WERE RIGHT.
THERE IS AN ANIMAL IN ME, OKAY?

15:13.521 --> 15:15.523
BUT I'VE MEDITATED,
AND HE'S BACK IN HIS CAGE.

15:15.566 --> 15:16.524
OKAY, FINE.

15:16.567 --> 15:17.917
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOUR LEG?

15:17.960 --> 15:19.309
NOTHING, IT'S JUST--
IT'S JUST CHARLEY HORSE.

15:19.353 --> 15:20.528
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

15:20.571 --> 15:21.964
LOOKS A LOT WORSE
THAN A CHARLEY HORSE.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.923
OKAY, WHY DON'T YOU LAY DOWN
AND LET ME STRETCH YOU?

15:23.966 --> 15:25.098
OKAY, STOP TELLING ME
WHAT TO DO.

15:25.141 --> 15:26.708
LET'S MAKE IT QUICK.

15:26.751 --> 15:28.971
OH, BOY.
NOW, JUST BREATHE FOR ME, OKAY?

15:29.015 --> 15:29.972
IT'S TIGHT.
BREATHE.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.800
OH, MY GOSH.
WHAT?

15:31.843 --> 15:33.628
THERE'S PHYSICAL PAIN
AND THERE EMOTIONAL PAIN.

15:33.671 --> 15:36.326
WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH HERE
IS CLEARLY EMOTIONAL PAIN.

15:36.370 --> 15:38.720
MORGAN TOLD ME ABOUT
YOUR EX-WIFE AND THE LETTER.

15:38.763 --> 15:40.635
HE TOLD YOU ABOUT MY EX--YOU NEED TO SPEAK WITH HER...

15:40.678 --> 15:42.289
AND YOU NEED TO RESOLVE THIS,

15:42.332 --> 15:45.161
OTHERWISE THE PAIN WILL CONTINUE
AND GROW UNTIL IT CONSUMES YOU.

15:45.205 --> 15:47.076
OW! OH.
YOU'RE GOOD.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.295
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

15:48.338 --> 15:49.513
DANNY, LISTEN TO ME.
YEP.

15:49.557 --> 15:51.994
SOMETIMES, GOOD PEOPLE DO
BAD THINGS, OKAY?

15:52.038 --> 15:53.300
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
YEAH.

15:53.343 --> 15:55.432
TAKE MINDY AND ME
FOR AN EXAMPLE.

15:55.476 --> 15:57.043
WE HIT SOME ROCKY TERRAIN,

15:57.086 --> 15:59.306
BUT I'M GONNA SPEAK WITH HER
AND I'M GONNA CLEAR IT RIGHT UP.

15:59.349 --> 16:01.873
AND I SUGGEST YOU DO THE SAME
WITH YOUR EX.

16:01.917 --> 16:03.005
OW!
WHAT? WHAT?

16:03.049 --> 16:04.050
NO, NO, DON'T STOP!
I'M CLOSE.

16:04.093 --> 16:05.529
DON'T STOP.
OKAY, OKAY.

16:05.573 --> 16:06.661
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
OH, THERE--

16:06.704 --> 16:08.010
THERE IT IS.
THAT'S THE SPOT.

16:08.054 --> 16:10.056
THAT'S THE SPOT.I'M HERE, I'M HERE, I'M HERE!

16:10.099 --> 16:11.840
DANNY, BRENDAN...
[panting]

16:11.883 --> 16:14.103
YOU KNOW THAT PEOPLE
CAN SEE YOU HERE, RIGHT?

16:14.147 --> 16:16.671
YOU'RE ALREADY HERE?
THAT'S LIKE A 9-MINUTE MILE.

16:16.714 --> 16:18.151
YOU'RE GONNA
KICK MORGAN'S ASS.

16:18.194 --> 16:19.630
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
YEAH!

16:19.674 --> 16:21.023
I'VE NEVER RUN THAT FAST.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.459
NICE.

16:22.938 --> 16:25.027
OH!
OH!

16:25.071 --> 16:27.421
ARE YOU OKAY?I'M FINE, I'M FINE.

16:27.464 --> 16:29.031
THAT'S DISGUSTING.I OVEREXERTED MYSELF,

16:29.075 --> 16:30.380
BUT I'M GONNA
BE ABLE TO DO THIS.

16:30.424 --> 16:31.599
OKAY.NO PROBLEM.

16:31.642 --> 16:32.861
SUCCESS PUKES. YES.YOU CAN RUN.

16:32.904 --> 16:35.342
I'M READY TO
ROCK 'N' ROLL THIS.

16:35.385 --> 16:36.560
OH, YOU JUST PUKED ON ME.UGH!

16:36.604 --> 16:37.997
OKAY.
I CAN'T DO THIS.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.346
I THINK THAT WE'RE WINNERS

16:39.389 --> 16:40.956
JUST FOR HAVING SIGNED UP
FOR THIS RACE.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.523
NO, NO, NO, NO.
ENOUGH OF THAT CRAP.

16:42.566 --> 16:43.959
THAT'S NOT WHAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.

16:44.003 --> 16:44.960
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:45.004 --> 16:46.179
SCREW THAT, OKAY?

16:46.222 --> 16:47.658
I'M RUNNING THIS RACE.

16:47.702 --> 16:48.964
DANNY, YOU'RE WEARING
UNDERWEAR

16:49.008 --> 16:50.096
AND YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE ANY SNEAKERS ON.

16:50.139 --> 16:52.054
YES, I DO HAVE SNEAKERS
RIGHT HERE.

16:53.490 --> 16:54.578
OH, MY GOD.

16:54.622 --> 16:55.971
WE'RE THE SAME SIZE.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.190
HE HAS REALLY SMALL FEET.

16:57.233 --> 16:59.061
HEY, HEY.
LOOK, LET'S HAVE A GOOD RACE.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.062
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
WAIT, NO!

17:00.106 --> 17:01.368
AH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:01.411 --> 17:03.979
SEE YOU
AT THE FINISH LINE, BUDDY.

17:08.766 --> 17:10.551
[cheers and applause]

17:17.993 --> 17:19.081
HEY.

17:19.125 --> 17:20.169
HEY.

17:20.213 --> 17:22.084
CASEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

17:22.128 --> 17:24.521
YOU PUT ON QUITE THE SHOW
WHEN YOU SHOWED UP TODAY.

17:24.565 --> 17:26.697
I MEAN, I'VE GOT
NINE TEN-YEAR-OLD HINDUS

17:26.741 --> 17:28.395
AND 17 ANGRY PARENTS
TO DEAL WITH,

17:28.438 --> 17:30.527
TWO OF WHICH
ARE MENOPAUSAL MOMS.

17:30.571 --> 17:32.790
AND THEN I GOT THREE GAY DADS,
WHICH IS ANOTHER STORY.

17:32.834 --> 17:34.096
WELL, YOU PUT ME ON THE SPOT.

17:34.140 --> 17:35.532
YOU WERE LIKE,
"HEY, KIDS, COME CHECK OUT

17:35.576 --> 17:37.534
"WHAT THIS EXOTIC,
SEXY INDIAN WOMAN I'M DATING,

17:37.578 --> 17:39.449
WHAT SHE THINKS
ABOUT YOUR RELIGION."

17:39.493 --> 17:40.450
YEP.
SO...

17:40.494 --> 17:41.582
UM, BRENDAN,

17:41.625 --> 17:43.584
THIS IS CASEY,
MY BOYFRIEND.

17:43.627 --> 17:45.064
HEY. CASEY.
HOW YOU DOING?

17:45.107 --> 17:47.240
BUT WE ACTUALLY MIGHT BE
ABOUT TO BREAK UP.

17:47.283 --> 17:49.459
SO IF YOU COULD JUST
WAIT A COUPLE MINUTES,

17:49.503 --> 17:51.200
I SHOULD HAVE SOME CLARITY.

17:51.244 --> 17:53.115
YOU WANT ME TO WALK
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

17:53.159 --> 17:54.595
JUST OVER--
LIKE, HANG OUT OVER THERE.

17:54.638 --> 17:55.813
THEN I SHOULD--
YES.

17:55.857 --> 17:56.814
I'LL CHECK BACK IN
WITH YOU.

17:56.858 --> 18:00.253
IF THAT'S COOL WITH YOU.

18:00.296 --> 18:02.298
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
I DO NOT WANT YOU TO CONVERT.

18:02.342 --> 18:03.734
DON'T DO IT.

18:03.778 --> 18:05.649
IS IT BECAUSE I SMELL LIKE BARF
BECAUSE I BARFED?

18:05.693 --> 18:07.303
LOOK, I'M TRYING TO SAY
WE'RE GOOD,

18:07.347 --> 18:08.609
AND I REALIZE THAT

18:08.652 --> 18:10.393
IT'S NOT FAIR OF ME
TO ASK YOU TO CONVERT.

18:10.437 --> 18:12.613
I JUST NEEDED TO KNOW THAT
YOU TOOK RELIGION SERIOUSLY.

18:12.656 --> 18:13.788
AND WHEN YOU SHOWED UP
AND RUINED

18:13.831 --> 18:15.833
MY SUNDAY SCHOOL CLASS
TODAY,

18:15.877 --> 18:17.270
I REALIZED THAT YOU DO.

18:17.313 --> 18:20.534
YOU COULD BE WITH LIKE
AN AGNOSTIC HINDU-Y PERSON?

18:20.577 --> 18:21.578
I WANT YOU.

18:21.622 --> 18:22.971
CASEY.
COME HERE.

18:23.014 --> 18:24.799
THAT'S VERY JESUS-Y OF YOU.COME HERE. COME HERE.

18:24.842 --> 18:26.496
LET'S NOT KISS THOUGH,

18:26.540 --> 18:28.237
BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE
A LITTLE BIT OF PUKE.

18:28.281 --> 18:29.543
IF YOU CARE ABOUT ME,

18:29.586 --> 18:31.675
YOU'LL KISS ME EVEN THOUGH
I TASTE LIKE PUKE.

18:38.769 --> 18:41.511
[cheers and applause]

18:42.643 --> 18:45.385
[Brendan]

[all encouraging]

18:59.660 --> 19:01.401

19:09.409 --> 19:10.366

19:10.410 --> 19:11.541
YOU'RE ALMOST HERE!

19:11.585 --> 19:12.673
PUT ME DOWN.
THEY'RE TAKING PICTURES.

19:12.716 --> 19:13.717
PUT ME DOWN!

19:13.761 --> 19:15.502
TRY TO SMILE.

19:15.545 --> 19:16.633
ALL RIGHT!

19:16.677 --> 19:18.287
COME ON! I LOVE YOU!

19:18.331 --> 19:20.115
[groaning]

19:20.159 --> 19:21.856
MORGAN, YOU LOST.

19:21.899 --> 19:23.771
DANNY? DANNY?

19:23.814 --> 19:25.468
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?

19:25.512 --> 19:27.078
I'M SORRY.
HEY!

19:27.122 --> 19:28.341
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

19:28.384 --> 19:30.212
[Brendan]
YOU CAN ALL GO TO HELL!

19:30.256 --> 19:31.387
[screaming]HEY, COME ON, DUDE.

19:33.433 --> 19:35.609
OH, MY GOD!

19:35.652 --> 19:38.525

DESLAURIER.

19:38.568 --> 19:40.788
GET HIM OUTTA HERE, DUNCAN.
LOCK HIM DOWN.
GET OFF ME!

19:42.833 --> 19:45.749
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE MAILED
THAT LETTER.

19:45.793 --> 19:47.708
I KNOW.

19:47.751 --> 19:51.146
BECAUSE I SHOULD'VE MAILED IT...
YEARS AGO.

19:51.190 --> 19:55.063
I KNOW I DON'T BELIEVE
IN SECOND CHANCES, BUT--

19:55.106 --> 19:56.760
I KNOW.
I LOVE YOU TOO.

19:56.804 --> 19:58.936
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY.

19:58.980 --> 20:00.982
NO, WELL, YOU MIGHT NOT
HAVE SAID IT WITH...

20:01.025 --> 20:03.332
YOUR LIPS, BUT YOU WERE
SAYING IT WITH THESE GUYS.

20:03.376 --> 20:04.551
OKAY.

20:04.594 --> 20:06.248
OKAY, COME ON.
STOP IT.
I'M SORRY.

20:06.292 --> 20:08.119
DON'T MAKE ME REGRET
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO ASK YOU.

20:08.163 --> 20:10.687
I WANNA HIRE YOU BACK.
YOU'RE A GREAT NURSE.

20:10.731 --> 20:12.559
COME BACK TO WORK WITH US,
ALL RIGHT?

20:12.602 --> 20:13.647
I CAN'T.
I JUST--

20:13.690 --> 20:14.909
I GOT A JOB--
WHAT?

20:14.952 --> 20:16.127
I GOT A JOB
WITH THESE GUYS.

20:16.171 --> 20:17.738
I'VE SAID YES.
THEY GOT ME A NEW DESK.

20:17.781 --> 20:18.782
AND IT'S JUST LIKE--

20:18.826 --> 20:20.871
IT'S NICE NOT HAVING
THE PRESSURE

20:20.915 --> 20:22.482
OF BEING THE BEST LOOKING GUY
IN THE OFFICE.

20:22.525 --> 20:23.918
I'M SORRY.NO, NO, NO. MORGAN--

20:23.961 --> 20:25.049

HEY.

20:30.794 --> 20:32.622
I FORGOT TO GIVE THIS

20:32.666 --> 20:34.581
IT'S FROM CHRISTINA.
I OPENED IT.

20:34.624 --> 20:37.105
BUT JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT
THERE WASN'T ANY ANTHRAX IN IT

20:37.148 --> 20:39.281
OR IT WAS LIKE A PHOTO
OF HER DOING SOME OTHER GUY.

20:39.325 --> 20:40.587
HEY!

20:43.154 --> 20:44.721
ARE YOU SMILING?

20:44.765 --> 20:46.332
[sighs]

20:46.375 --> 20:48.508
I'M JUST MAD.
WHY?

20:48.551 --> 20:50.510
I'M MAD THAT
I'M NOT MAD ANYMORE.

20:50.553 --> 20:51.685
HEY.

20:51.728 --> 20:53.164
ARE YOU OKAY?

20:53.208 --> 20:54.557
YEAH.

20:54.601 --> 20:56.472
I'M ALWAYS OKAY.

20:56.516 --> 20:58.909
HEY, UH, YOU WANNA COME
TO DINNER WITH US?

20:58.953 --> 21:02.478
UH, NO, I'M GOOD.
I'M GOOD, PASTOR.

21:02.522 --> 21:04.567
YOU GUYS HAVE A GOOD TIME.

21:04.611 --> 21:06.047
GO HAVE FUN
WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND.

21:06.090 --> 21:07.396
OKAY.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.268

[phone ringing]

21:20.148 --> 21:21.323
DANNY?

YOU WANNA GET
A CUP OF COFFEE WITH ME?

21:23.586 --> 21:26.285

WHY DON'T I
GIVE YOU A CALL LATER?

21:35.685 --> 21:37.687
GO TO BED.
