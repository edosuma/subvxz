But utilitarianism would say

00:08.007 --> 00:09.885
you have an obligation to pull the switch.

00:09.968 --> 00:13.180
Saving five people justifies killing one.

00:15.390 --> 00:17.267
The one person isn't Hitler.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.562

00:23.815 --> 00:25.567

00:27.528 --> 00:29.071
-It doesn't matter.
-Gomaco!

00:29.154 --> 00:30.739
The point is, you should pursue

00:30.822 --> 00:32.491
the greatest good
for the greatest number of people.

00:32.573 --> 00:35.327
For example, if I have two pairs of shoes

00:35.410 --> 00:38.205
and someone else has none,
I should give them one of mine.

00:38.288 --> 00:39.915
I have five pairs of shoes.

00:39.998 --> 00:42.668
Am I being selfish
by not giving the other four pairs

00:42.751 --> 00:44.503
to, like, an octopus?

00:44.586 --> 00:46.588
Well, a strict ethical altruist would say

00:46.672 --> 00:49.007
you should give away
everything that you have.

00:49.091 --> 00:51.009
I'm worried I'm not being
a good enough person.

00:51.093 --> 00:54.054
Well, asking those questions
is what philosophy is all about.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.348
That and justifying an open marriage

00:56.431 --> 00:58.433
to a wife who agrees a little too readily.

00:58.517 --> 01:01.520
Now every time you come home,
the mailbox flag is up,

01:01.603 --> 01:04.438
and you have to grade papers
by the dome light in your car.

01:06.316 --> 01:07.609
Well, that's class.

01:18.662 --> 01:19.913
Anything, Xan. Anything.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.415
You are my sister, and I love you.

01:21.498 --> 01:24.167
God! Look, I've been working
at the university TV station.

01:24.251 --> 01:27.045
CTV? My favorite show
is the dining hall menu.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.756

you get the menu ahead of time?

01:29.840 --> 01:30.882
When's chicken?

01:30.966 --> 01:33.176
They're letting me produce my own show
about women on campus.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.428

01:34.511 --> 01:36.555

01:38.265 --> 01:40.183
Oof, is that set in stone?

01:40.267 --> 01:43.979
It's kind of a big deal for a first-year,
and I was hoping that you'd come on

01:44.062 --> 01:46.064
and talk about your tragic life
or whatever.

01:46.148 --> 01:47.608
Oh, I don't know, Xan.

01:47.691 --> 01:51.612
I wanna help, but I just started
bumping that stuff down the old Google.

What if, instead,
I talked about my style icons?

Don't you think people
would be inspired by your story?

02:02.372 --> 02:03.832
You're, like, a symbol

02:03.915 --> 02:05.667
that people can overcome anything.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.295
Right.

for the greatest number of people.

02:14.009 --> 02:15.844

for a limo driver who was scalded

09:17.474 --> 09:20.560
after one of those women threw
a Skinnygirl hot toddy on his crotch.

09:20.643 --> 09:23.104
Now Andy Cohen wants to meet with me?

09:23.188 --> 09:25.023
I'm so embarrassed, Russ.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.524
That's not who I am anymore.

09:26.608 --> 09:28.860
Because of you,
the woman on that tape is dead.

09:28.943 --> 09:31.571
Boy, I wish that was the first time
that had been said to a Snyder.

09:31.654 --> 09:34.616
Now the only reality show I care about

09:34.699 --> 09:36.743
is providing affordable dental care

09:36.826 --> 09:39.079
to young women
all over the world who busted.

09:39.162 --> 09:40.371
Or...

09:40.455 --> 09:41.998
saving this guy...

09:42.082 --> 09:44.375
[bestial hissing and snarling]

09:44.459 --> 09:45.418
...from extinction.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.837
Right, right. The Haitian toilet rat.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.923
Oh, we're trying to use
the scientific name,

09:50.006 --> 09:51.758
<i>Hispaniolan solenodon.</i>

09:51.841 --> 09:54.636
It's not easy to get people
to care about this little fella

09:54.719 --> 09:56.930
and his unquenchable thirst
for human poop.

09:57.013 --> 09:59.641
Well, if you really want
to get the word out,

09:59.724 --> 10:03.103
those <i>Real Housewife </i> shows
are popular, right?

10:03.186 --> 10:05.271
-What?
-I know for a fact

10:05.355 --> 10:07.982
that 2.8 million people
saw my client's genitals get erased.

10:08.817 --> 10:10.944
Well, it would raise awareness.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.737
Certainly more than
the Rat Bucket Challenge.

10:12.821 --> 10:15.115
-That did not work.
-No.

10:15.198 --> 10:16.533
So let's just meet with this guy.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.078
If you really think it's a good idea.

10:22.497 --> 10:25.041
Did you buy more copies
of today's <i>Post?</i>

10:25.125 --> 10:26.793
Yeah, it's just...

10:26.876 --> 10:29.754
how often does the newspaper say
you went from "dud to stud"?

10:29.838 --> 10:32.966
They also said I went
from "slop job to top dog,"

10:33.049 --> 10:36.052
"fugly to snuggly,"
"hot mess to great vest."

10:36.136 --> 10:38.763
They Photoshopped a vest on me
to make that one work.

10:39.264 --> 10:40.306
It's not a great paper.

10:40.390 --> 10:41.891
[both chuckle]

10:41.975 --> 10:44.894
[quirky music]

10:49.566 --> 10:51.776
Well, now this thing wants a fingerprint.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.653
No way. First of all,

10:53.736 --> 10:56.489
I sanded mine off
after the Lufthansa heist,

10:56.573 --> 10:57.824
and that thumb I found--

10:57.907 --> 11:00.368
Lillian, this thing
is gonna solve all your problems.

11:00.451 --> 11:01.536
I don't--

11:01.619 --> 11:05.123
You can use it to feed your cats
with this automatic cat feeder.

11:05.623 --> 11:08.626
"For if you ever leave your apartment."

11:08.710 --> 11:12.213
And you can check on your stuff
with this wireless security camera.

11:13.256 --> 11:15.884
Hey, this thing has night vision.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.803
Maybe now I can finally catch that ghost.

11:18.887 --> 11:22.056
Or realize it's just Titus
stealing your food in a sheet.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.309
Yeah, that's what you think.

11:24.392 --> 11:27.437
And this is a mini 3-D printer.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.356
TSA doesn't allow weapons on planes,

11:30.440 --> 11:31.649
but when we get to Stockholm,

11:31.733 --> 11:33.192
we can print a copy of that hammer

11:33.276 --> 11:35.236
you're always carrying around with you.

11:35.320 --> 11:38.197
It's a bus pass. It's a key.
It's a hammer.

11:38.281 --> 11:40.867
See? The modern world's not so bad.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.620
[Lillian] Mm...

11:43.703 --> 11:44.954
[Lillian sighs]

11:47.123 --> 11:48.291
Everybody leave.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.465
[Andy] Thanks for meeting with us,
Jacqueline.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.300
I hope you enjoyed the gift baské.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.594
Well, I'm certainly flattered
that you liked my tape.

11:59.677 --> 12:03.723
Your music video was long.

12:04.724 --> 12:05.767
[exhales]

12:05.850 --> 12:07.810
Imagine there's music.

12:07.894 --> 12:11.940
<i>♪ I'm lookin' for a sugar dadday ♪</i>

12:12.774 --> 12:16.402
<i>♪ Who has a lap for babay ♪</i>

12:16.486 --> 12:18.321
[moans] Oh.

12:18.404 --> 12:21.407
Wah, wah.

12:21.491 --> 12:24.035
[Buckley] Mom, what are you doing?

12:24.535 --> 12:26.704
You have to remember,
that was months ago.

12:26.788 --> 12:29.749
Honestly, Jacqueline,
you didn't even get on our gaydar,

12:29.832 --> 12:31.125
which is a machine
we have here at Bravo...

12:31.209 --> 12:32.377
We do.

12:32.460 --> 12:35.380
...until we saw you in the <i>Post</i>
with him.

12:36.339 --> 12:37.465
Me? No.

12:37.548 --> 12:38.800
-[Andy mouths word]
-[Russ] Oh, no, no, no.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.594
I'm just a wealthy lawyer
who became hot while he was in a coma.

12:41.678 --> 12:44.847
Yeah, all I really want is to have
a legal marriage with this woman.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.808
Wow-wowee-wow.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.017
Well said, Samjamin.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.311
Look, the only reason we're even here

12:50.395 --> 12:52.480
is to get exposure
for a very important charity.

12:52.563 --> 12:55.316
Sure, I have a charity that pays hotels

12:55.400 --> 12:58.403
to not recommend
restaurants I love to tourists.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.196
[whispering] So important.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.782
Well, the <i>Hispaniolan solenodon</i>...

13:02.865 --> 13:05.201
[bestial hissing]

13:05.284 --> 13:06.744
...is critically endangered.

13:06.828 --> 13:07.912
No, thank you.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.539
Ugh, she busted!

13:09.622 --> 13:11.791
Our shows are about beautiful things.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.626
If you're gonna talk about a charity,

13:13.710 --> 13:15.420
it needs to be for, like,

13:15.503 --> 13:16.963
wicker baskets at a beach house

13:17.046 --> 13:20.091
or the way Cate Blanchett carries herself.

13:20.174 --> 13:21.342
Or how about tigers?

13:21.426 --> 13:22.385
[Samjamin] Mm.

13:22.468 --> 13:23.970
"Rawr" comes to mind.

13:24.053 --> 13:27.015
What do tigers have to do
with saving the toilet rat?

13:27.098 --> 13:29.142
Jacqueline, it's-- it's the halo effect.

13:29.225 --> 13:33.146
You save the apex predator,
you save the ecosystem.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.897
But tigers don't live in Haiti.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.357
Have you seen <i>Life of Pi</i> ?

13:36.441 --> 13:37.900
Tigers go on boats,

13:37.984 --> 13:40.403
and wait, I forget, do boats go to Haiti?

13:40.486 --> 13:43.031
Looks like we have a deal.

13:43.114 --> 13:47.285
[dramatic music]

13:48.328 --> 13:49.662
-All right, Cyndee--
-Oh, hang on.

13:49.746 --> 13:50.663
You've got loose shrimp in here.

13:50.747 --> 13:53.124
Nom, nom, nom. Take that, shrimps.

13:53.207 --> 13:54.542
Cyndee, stop eating air shrimp.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.127
Now everyone said "shrimp" except me.

13:56.210 --> 13:58.337
-Shrimp!
-All right, how do I do this?

13:58.421 --> 14:00.339
How do I talk about "you know who"

14:00.423 --> 14:01.632
"you know what-ing" me

14:01.716 --> 14:02.884
while we were in the "you know where"?

14:02.967 --> 14:04.677
Okay, when you meet Alex Trebek,

14:04.761 --> 14:06.679
don't get freaked out that he has legs.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.931
What? No, I know people have legs.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.141
Lieutenant Dan doesn't.

14:10.224 --> 14:11.601
[exhales sharply] Cyndee,

14:11.684 --> 14:14.312
that is not the kind of help Kimmy needs.

14:15.772 --> 14:18.566
[sighs] The key is being able
to cry on cue.

14:18.649 --> 14:22.403
Imagine you're biting
into a delicious stick of butter

14:22.487 --> 14:24.906
and then it's just cheese.

14:24.989 --> 14:27.200
[crying] Why?

14:27.992 --> 14:30.036
Could you two <i>be</i> any less helpful?

14:30.119 --> 14:32.955
-Wow, Chandler, Kimmy?
-Not Chandler. That's uncalled for.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.208
Look, I don't want to do Xan's show.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.793
-Then don't.
-Yeah.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.003
But the thing is, I have to do it.

14:39.087 --> 14:40.380
Because of the money.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.048
No, I'm not getting paid, Cyndee.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.925
Your reward is participating

14:44.008 --> 14:46.010
in television's current golden age.

14:46.094 --> 14:48.846
It's because I have an obligation
to help people.

14:48.930 --> 14:51.641
So if going on TV will do that,
then I don't have a choice.

14:51.724 --> 14:52.975
Even if it kills me.

14:53.059 --> 14:53.893
Says who?

14:53.976 --> 14:56.354
Uh, I don't know. Philosophy?

14:56.437 --> 14:58.398
Kill one person to save five.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.233
Give your extra shoes to a spider.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.402
Donate all your organs,
'cause, yeah, you die,

15:02.485 --> 15:04.070
but you save, like, 100 people.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.738
I don't know how many organs a person has.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.407
So that's philosophy?

15:07.490 --> 15:08.533
Rude.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.701
Yeah, if everyone donated

15:10.785 --> 15:12.703
all their organs,
then everyone would be dead,

15:12.787 --> 15:14.163
and there'd just be,
like, a pile of organs.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.582
I must not be explaining it right.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.209
Look, if a trolley--

15:18.292 --> 15:20.503
-What kind of trolley?
-I don't know! Just learned this morning.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.088
Doesn't sound like you did.

15:22.171 --> 15:25.216
[laughs] Sick burn, Cyndee. I like you.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.760
I don't know
how to explain this stuff to you two.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.971
You know what?
Come to class with me tomorrow.

15:30.054 --> 15:32.265
And to quote a poster of Bo Jackson

15:32.348 --> 15:34.058
wearing a graduation cap I once saw,

15:34.142 --> 15:35.435
"Feel the learn."

15:38.396 --> 15:39.689
[door shuts]

15:41.482 --> 15:44.110
On the count of three,
let's say what we want for dinner.

15:44.193 --> 15:46.487
One, two, three.

15:46.571 --> 15:48.322
-[both] Dessert spaghetti!
-[Cyndee squeals]

15:48.406 --> 15:50.533
[both laugh]

15:58.166 --> 16:00.209
[bestial hissing]

16:03.921 --> 16:05.548
How does this look? After the <i>Post </i> story,

16:05.631 --> 16:07.800
I really feel like people
are gonna expect a vest.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.474
What's going on here, Russ?

16:14.557 --> 16:16.309
Do you not like it? I was gonna wear it

16:16.392 --> 16:18.853
to the launch party
for Skinnygirl baby formula this weekend.

16:20.104 --> 16:23.608
Look, I know, for you,
this is a whole new world.

16:23.691 --> 16:26.027
-I feel like Jasmine.
-Not Aladdin?

16:26.611 --> 16:29.280
But I feel like
all this attention is making you forget

16:29.363 --> 16:30.656
what we're trying to do here.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.992
No, yeah, the tigers. Of course.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.953
No, the toilet rat. It's going extinct.

16:36.037 --> 16:37.288
Who cares? I hope it does!

16:38.164 --> 16:38.998
I'm sorry.

16:39.957 --> 16:41.709
It's just, that weird,

16:41.792 --> 16:43.586
unloved little creature,

16:43.669 --> 16:45.254
that's who I used to be,

16:45.338 --> 16:46.756
and I don't want to be reminded of it.

16:47.924 --> 16:49.717
'Cause I'm a pretty tiger now.

16:50.301 --> 16:52.512
Every minute of my life
has been a struggle,

16:52.595 --> 16:54.597
against animal poachers and slum lords

16:54.680 --> 16:56.432
and my own family.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.975
I know.

16:58.059 --> 17:00.228
Your brothers
nearly punch-buggied you to death.

17:00.311 --> 17:02.813
After luring me
into a Volkswagen dealership.

17:02.897 --> 17:03.731
That's not fair!

17:04.941 --> 17:06.233
Well, I'm not that kid anymore.

17:06.317 --> 17:07.777
Hiding in the attic,

17:07.859 --> 17:08.944
sorting my shells.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.488
[Jacqueline exhales]

17:10.570 --> 17:13.907
So I'm sorry
if I just wanna enjoy life for once.

17:13.991 --> 17:16.077
And you should,

17:16.160 --> 17:18.119
but does it have to be
on <i>Real Housewives</i> ?

17:18.204 --> 17:20.957
Why not? Come on, it'll be fun.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.626
Oh, I gotta bring
a change of clothes to the party.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.628
The Countess is supposed
to shove me into a koi pond.

17:27.128 --> 17:30.049
[soft music]

17:36.722 --> 17:39.725
[mischievous music]

17:39.809 --> 17:43.354
I just rocked an old man's bones

17:43.437 --> 17:45.398
all night long. Jealous?

17:45.481 --> 17:46.941
Ugh, no.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.777
Wait, now I'm picturing being with Artie.

17:50.987 --> 17:52.238
He's so attentive.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.240
Artie invited me to go to Europe with him,

17:54.323 --> 17:57.577
and he got me a translation app
on my phone

17:57.660 --> 18:01.163
so I don't have to learn
any of the dumb languages.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.374
It's not fair. Russ is hot.

18:03.457 --> 18:04.834
Kimmy's on TV.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.252
Now you're going to Europe.

18:06.335 --> 18:07.545
Artie's probably gonna propose.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.922
Meanwhile, I've been a saint all year!

18:11.007 --> 18:12.550
Some of the saints
were flawed in real life.

18:12.633 --> 18:15.970
Look at Francis. I don't trust a man
who spends that much time with birds.

18:16.053 --> 18:19.599
Wait, so you think
this is gonna be a proposal?

18:19.682 --> 18:23.811
Well, he's gonna have
to ask my parents first.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.521
At Greenwood Cemetery...

18:25.605 --> 18:26.856
[softly] Oh.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.858
...where they work.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.485
But is that what I want?

18:31.569 --> 18:35.114
I thought I'd never get married again
after Roland died.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.949
Was shot in the face by you, Lillian!

18:37.033 --> 18:39.327
Well, he died, didn't he?

18:39.410 --> 18:42.330
[quirky music]

18:44.832 --> 18:47.835
[Russ straining, grunting]

19:00.181 --> 19:01.265
Do you know what this is?

19:01.349 --> 19:03.684
It's a fox shell. <i>Fasciolaria trapezium</i>.

19:03.768 --> 19:06.354
[sighs] Russ, this is still inside you.

19:06.437 --> 19:08.564
I know. Because my brothers...

19:08.648 --> 19:10.483
No, I mean, that kid in the attic

19:10.566 --> 19:13.736
is a big part of who you are,
and I don't want to lose him.

19:13.819 --> 19:14.779
I do.

19:14.862 --> 19:17.323
I was in the attic
because I was hiding from my family.

19:17.406 --> 19:19.241
I know. They tormented you.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.577
So you've always stood up
for the less fortunate,

19:21.661 --> 19:23.871
the unloved, the little guy,

19:23.954 --> 19:26.916
and that's why your family
is on their way up here right now.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.042
What? No!

19:28.125 --> 19:29.293
No, no!

19:29.377 --> 19:30.961
I'm sorry, but if you're gonna remember

19:31.045 --> 19:33.714
what it's like to be the underdog,
I'm gonna have to pile some dogs on you.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.675
You said I would never
have to see them again!

19:35.758 --> 19:36.717
[door opens]

19:36.801 --> 19:38.678
-Russ.
-There he is!

19:38.761 --> 19:39.804
No, don't hit me!

19:39.887 --> 19:42.223
[all laugh]

19:42.306 --> 19:43.724
What's happening?

19:43.808 --> 19:45.559
What? Can't a father hug his son?

19:45.643 --> 19:49.146
Ooh, I am so proud of you,

19:49.230 --> 19:51.482
going from dud to stud like this!

19:51.565 --> 19:54.151
We couldn't believe it
when we saw your picture in <i>Hot Beef.</i>

19:54.235 --> 19:55.486
[Drew] It's a magazine
that Flash and I use

19:55.569 --> 19:57.655
to get pumped for workouts.

19:57.738 --> 20:00.032
Oh, boy, this is a lot to take in.

20:00.908 --> 20:02.076
Said the tailor.

20:03.786 --> 20:06.706
[all laugh]

20:06.789 --> 20:09.959
[all talking at once]

20:10.042 --> 20:11.502
[laughter]

20:12.962 --> 20:14.171
Got a sec, Teach?

20:14.255 --> 20:15.798
I've asked you not to call me that.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.926
I was trying to explain
utilitarianism to my friends...

20:19.009 --> 20:20.886
Titus Andromedon, star on the rise.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.012
[Cyndee] Cyndee Pokorny,

20:22.096 --> 20:23.264
BunCo booth honey.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.015
And I really beefed it.

20:25.099 --> 20:28.144
It's all about doing what you can
to maximize the good, right?

20:28.227 --> 20:31.439
Like, if you see someone with no shoes,
you should give them yours.

20:31.522 --> 20:33.733
Girl, no one wants
your Swedish-ass shoes.

20:33.816 --> 20:37.194
Or, if you had a pizza,
you'd give it to people who were starving.

20:37.278 --> 20:39.071
-Nope.
-[Kimmy] Right.

20:39.155 --> 20:41.115
Even if that means you starve to death.

20:41.198 --> 20:44.076
So if I have a story
that could really help people,

20:44.160 --> 20:47.329
I should share it, even if it hurts bad.

20:47.413 --> 20:50.583
Well, um, my mentor, Peter Singer
from Princeton University...

20:50.666 --> 20:52.334
[whispering] Real Ivy.

20:52.418 --> 20:55.045
...would say that a truly moral person

20:55.129 --> 20:58.340
would even give away her organs
to those in need.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.843
Of course, if everyone did that

21:00.926 --> 21:04.805
in the real world, there'd just be this,
like, pile of organs.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.767
[Kimmy] But no. Utilitarianism--

21:07.850 --> 21:09.935
Is just one theory.

21:10.019 --> 21:12.688
Next week, we're getting into
Kant's categorical imperative,

21:12.772 --> 21:14.023
which says something totally different,

21:14.106 --> 21:16.609
and according to ethical egoism,

21:16.692 --> 21:19.445
being selfish is the only true morality.

21:20.237 --> 21:22.823
Philosophy is... dumb.

21:22.907 --> 21:26.577
So I don't have to tell people
about my stuff if I don't want to.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.412
John Stuart Mill said

21:28.496 --> 21:30.956
taking "sufficient enjoyment" in life

21:31.040 --> 21:34.293
is actually necessary to act morally,

21:34.376 --> 21:36.504
which is the part of it that the wife

21:37.588 --> 21:38.881
really latched on to.

21:40.925 --> 21:42.384
Oh, I've gotta run.

21:42.468 --> 21:43.928
If I get fired from BunCo,

21:44.011 --> 21:46.430
I'll have to go back
to working the booth for SafetyTube.

21:46.514 --> 21:49.225
[scoffs] It's just an inferior product.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.936
[quirky music]

21:56.607 --> 21:58.609
One, two, three.

22:01.946 --> 22:03.072
[Orson] Damn it, Russ.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.824
I meant to bring Lappy for you.

22:04.907 --> 22:07.701
I swear I had him in the car a...

22:07.785 --> 22:11.455
Well, there you are, Lappy!

22:11.539 --> 22:12.957
Say hi to Russ!

22:13.040 --> 22:15.292
-[all laugh]
-Go for it, big brother.

22:15.376 --> 22:16.502
-Yeah.
-[Russ] Okay.

22:16.585 --> 22:17.837
[Orson chuckling]

22:19.505 --> 22:20.840
[Russ giggling]

22:20.923 --> 22:23.092
Are you actually enjoying this?

22:23.175 --> 22:25.469
These people are the bad guys.

22:25.553 --> 22:27.846
Our shared hatred of your family

22:27.930 --> 22:29.557
is what brought us together
in the first place.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.725
Speaking of which, you can do better, son.

22:32.977 --> 22:34.186
I know,

22:34.270 --> 22:36.564
but... they're my family,

22:36.647 --> 22:37.898
and they're being nice to me...

22:39.066 --> 22:41.735
and I don't care why.

22:41.819 --> 22:43.487
But they're monsters.

22:43.571 --> 22:44.905
They sent your brother to Gitmo.

22:44.989 --> 22:46.198
[Orson] That reminds me.

22:46.282 --> 22:48.742
The team needs a new head of PR,

22:48.826 --> 22:50.661
and I want this face

22:50.744 --> 22:54.373
to be the new face
of the Washington Gun-Takers.

22:55.457 --> 22:57.876
I guess I could ask Andy
to be on <i>Real Housewives of Potomac.</i>

22:57.960 --> 22:59.503
[Orson] Good idea, son.

22:59.587 --> 23:02.172
Think of the exposure for the team.

23:04.049 --> 23:05.884
I know I said
I didn't want them in my life,

23:05.968 --> 23:09.597
but maybe that's because
I never thought this would happen.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.765
I mean, me... on Lappy!

23:11.849 --> 23:13.309
That kid in the attic,

23:13.392 --> 23:15.686
what do you think he was whispering
into those shells?

23:15.769 --> 23:17.479
Don't ruin this, Russ.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.107
I was trying to fix you,

23:20.190 --> 23:23.360
but this is worse than <i>Real Housewives.</i>

23:23.444 --> 23:25.613
I don't wanna be a Snyder.

23:25.696 --> 23:29.783
[Orson] Oh, well,
I know when I'm not wanted.

23:29.867 --> 23:32.411
Snyders... to the blimp pad.

23:32.494 --> 23:35.706
We should be in D.C. in 30 to 40 hours,

23:36.206 --> 23:37.666
depending on the wind.

23:40.836 --> 23:44.465
I thought you turning into
a hottie with a body, trademark Titus,

23:44.548 --> 23:46.675
was my reward for everything I did

23:46.759 --> 23:48.677
while you were in the hospital,

23:48.761 --> 23:50.638
but it's your reward.

23:50.721 --> 23:53.223
Mine was learning that I'm smart

23:53.307 --> 23:54.767
and strong

23:54.850 --> 23:56.644
and I can do anything.

23:56.727 --> 23:57.811
I cooked.

23:57.895 --> 23:59.521
I had sex with your grandmother's ghost.

23:59.605 --> 24:00.522
Meemaw?

24:00.606 --> 24:04.068
You know, the Jacqueline
who made that audition tape

24:04.151 --> 24:06.111
would've loved this Russ.

24:07.613 --> 24:10.199
But we're going in different directions.

24:13.827 --> 24:16.205
[Russ sighs]

24:16.288 --> 24:19.583
[stirring orchestral music]

24:31.887 --> 24:33.597
[cat meows]

24:34.723 --> 24:37.351
All right, phone,
you think you know everything?

24:37.434 --> 24:38.852
Answer me this:

24:39.853 --> 24:42.064
If me and Artie is forever,

24:42.147 --> 24:46.151
does that mean I'm betraying the memory

24:46.235 --> 24:47.695
of my sweet,

24:48.404 --> 24:51.657
funky late husband Roland Peacock?

24:52.157 --> 24:55.244
[Siri] <i>This is what I found on the web</i>
<i>for Roland Peacock.</i>

24:55.327 --> 24:57.454
Wait!

24:57.538 --> 25:00.040
How do you know Roland, you skank?

25:00.124 --> 25:02.710
Oh, "Live at the Brown Note."

25:02.793 --> 25:04.837
I remember that show.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.922
-[applause]
-[Roland] <i>Thank you, thank you.</i>

25:07.005 --> 25:10.008
<i>Now, this next sloppy jam</i>
<i>goes out to my old lady, Lillian.</i>

25:10.092 --> 25:13.011
<i>Yeah, I plan on spending the rest</i>
<i>of my life with that freaky sister,</i>

25:13.095 --> 25:16.390
<i>whether it's 100 years</i>
<i>or she shoots me in the face tomorrow.</i>

25:16.473 --> 25:19.435
<i>Either way,</i>
<i>this song is about me dying first.</i>

25:19.518 --> 25:21.270
<i>It's called "Move On, Baby,</i>

25:21.353 --> 25:22.563
<i>Parentheses,</i>

25:22.646 --> 25:24.565
<i>A Turkey Dinner.</i>

25:24.648 --> 25:26.650
<i>Close parentheses."</i>
<i>Here we go.</i>

25:26.734 --> 25:29.653
[bass guitar solo]

25:34.491 --> 25:36.243
I shot him that night.

25:38.454 --> 25:40.956
Oh... [crying softly]

25:41.039 --> 25:42.875
Thank you.

25:42.958 --> 25:45.085
Thank you, Roland.

25:45.169 --> 25:47.671
[laughs softly]

25:47.755 --> 25:48.672
Hey, Artie.

25:51.008 --> 25:52.426
[dramatic music]

25:52.509 --> 25:53.427
Artie?

25:55.304 --> 25:56.722
Oh, no.

25:58.307 --> 26:01.769
Hotsy-totsy Liberace.
I've killed another one.

26:01.852 --> 26:06.356
[stately trumpet music]

26:06.440 --> 26:08.525
Good evening. I'm Xanthippe Voorhees.

26:08.609 --> 26:11.653
And welcome to the first-ever episode
of <i>Profiles.</i>

26:12.404 --> 26:15.699
My guest tonight
is a symbol of courage and hope.

26:15.783 --> 26:17.701
So all you Xan-Heads out there,

26:18.660 --> 26:20.704
please give a warm welcome
to Kimmy Schmidt.

26:20.788 --> 26:21.997
Thank you, Xan.

26:22.664 --> 26:24.541
I can't believe that high school girl
I once caught

26:24.625 --> 26:26.960
trying to bury her wet sheets
in the garden has a TV show.

26:27.044 --> 26:28.253
No! Why?

26:28.337 --> 26:30.047
Just tell us what happened to you.

26:31.590 --> 26:32.800
No.

26:32.883 --> 26:34.218
I'm not gonna do that, Xan.

26:34.301 --> 26:36.220
Of course not. Oh, you bitch.

26:36.303 --> 26:38.263
I know that sharing my story might help

26:38.347 --> 26:40.432
some of the millions of people
watching right now,

26:40.516 --> 26:42.309
but it's still my story.

26:42.392 --> 26:44.353
And I don't have to share it
if I don't want to.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.939
As Judge Mills Lane said,

26:47.022 --> 26:49.399
"You have to take some fishing enjoyment."

26:49.483 --> 26:50.526
Wow.

26:50.609 --> 26:53.237
Whatever that was originally,
we'll never know.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.322
There are a lot of ways to help people,

26:55.405 --> 26:58.367
and I guess I'll keep doing it
one person at a time.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.160
Starting right now.

27:00.244 --> 27:02.037
Is that why your friend is here
with a bag of wigs?

27:02.121 --> 27:05.124
Titus, welcome
to the golden age of television.

27:06.333 --> 27:07.751
Oh. [chuckles]

27:07.835 --> 27:09.294
[whimsical music]

27:09.378 --> 27:11.171
I didn't see y'all come in.

27:11.255 --> 27:15.217
You know, growing up in Mississippi,

27:15.300 --> 27:18.929
you sure do meet a lot of characters.

27:24.101 --> 27:25.727
[Titus groans]

27:25.811 --> 27:27.145
[Titus sighs]

27:27.229 --> 27:29.481
I'll never forget the day

27:29.565 --> 27:33.569
Miss Marilyn Monroe come to town.

27:47.416 --> 27:49.376
Did I not bring it?

27:54.131 --> 27:55.883
[door opens]

27:55.966 --> 27:57.009
-[Lillian] Oh.
-Hey, Lillian.

27:57.092 --> 27:58.302
Artie's dead, Kitus.

27:58.385 --> 28:00.929
No time to say both your names. He's dead.

28:01.013 --> 28:02.139
[both] What?

28:02.222 --> 28:03.682
Can I have his stuff?

28:03.765 --> 28:05.767
I killed another man in my bedroom.

28:05.851 --> 28:06.977
Oh, oh, God.

28:08.353 --> 28:09.938
[door opens]

28:10.022 --> 28:11.523
Lillian, there you are.

28:11.607 --> 28:14.109
You sure spend a lot of time
in your tenants' apartment.

28:14.192 --> 28:15.110
Is it okay with them?

28:15.193 --> 28:16.945
You're... alive.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.198
We don't know he's not a zombie.

28:19.281 --> 28:22.201
Mr. Goodman, say something
only an alive person would say.

28:22.284 --> 28:23.994
Okay, uh...

28:24.077 --> 28:25.996
you know you're in
a golden age of television

28:26.079 --> 28:28.457
when you take a show
like <i>The Americans </i> for granted.

28:29.625 --> 28:30.709
My God, Artie.

28:30.792 --> 28:32.711
You didn't have a pulse.

28:32.794 --> 28:35.130
Ah, look, I didn't want to worry you,

28:35.213 --> 28:38.050
but I have an LVAD machine in my heart.

28:38.133 --> 28:40.928
Like Dick Cheney had,
but mine was replacing something.

28:44.598 --> 28:46.808
Tough crowd. That was solid.

28:46.892 --> 28:49.353
Anyway, there's
a continuous flow of blood,

28:49.436 --> 28:51.438
so there's no pulse.

28:51.521 --> 28:55.317
So you gotta have that machine
in your chest forever,

28:55.400 --> 28:57.945
like me with that cop's bullet?

28:58.028 --> 28:59.488
Maybe that's why I love technology.

28:59.571 --> 29:00.822
It's keeping me alive,

29:00.906 --> 29:03.784
and I can watch a TV show
while recording two others.

29:03.867 --> 29:04.952
[Lillian giggles]

29:05.035 --> 29:07.120
But the LVAD, it's not a permanent fix.

29:07.704 --> 29:11.250
The doctors say I could have
a year, maybe two.

29:11.333 --> 29:13.669
Or it could be a month. So...

29:16.129 --> 29:17.839
[Titus whimpers]

29:17.923 --> 29:19.716
Titus, don't make this about you.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.135
It's too late.

29:22.219 --> 29:25.347
I'm gonna miss you so much,
Lillian's friend.

29:25.430 --> 29:28.767
[Lillian crying softly]

29:32.312 --> 29:34.773
[Titus crying softly]

29:34.856 --> 29:36.483
