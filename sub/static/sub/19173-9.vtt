WEBVTT

00:07.094 --> 00:08.258
Your plan failed.

00:08.259 --> 00:10.011
We're moving on to my plan.

00:10.094 --> 00:11.552
Go get it. Bring it up here right now.

00:11.635 --> 00:13.052
Go get what?

00:14.635 --> 00:16.094
We had it in our hands.

00:16.178 --> 00:18.385
This war was breathing
air. It was alive.

00:18.469 --> 00:21.594
Do not ask me to choose
between a war and a wife.

00:21.677 --> 00:22.927
Skeleton Island,

00:22.952 --> 00:25.011
well outside the
established trade route.

00:25.094 --> 00:26.677
It's no accident that Billy chose it...

00:26.761 --> 00:30.258
a place likely to put
us all out of balance.

00:30.259 --> 00:32.594
That man, I have it on good authority,

00:32.677 --> 00:36.136
claims to have been to Skeleton
Island, and can show us the way.

00:36.219 --> 00:39.011
I find myself in need of a new partner.

00:39.094 --> 00:41.385
If our cause is to survive,

00:41.469 --> 00:44.894
some of us must find a way
to keep our wits about us

00:44.919 --> 00:47.084
on behalf of those who cannot.

00:47.385 --> 00:50.258
I sent six of my men after him.

00:50.283 --> 00:52.993
I instructed them to kill Captain Flint.

03:16.011 --> 03:17.643
What are we looking at?

03:19.094 --> 03:21.034
Nassau.

03:21.259 --> 03:23.234
Thereabouts.

03:23.463 --> 03:25.136
A few days over the horizon,

03:25.219 --> 03:27.085
just waiting for us.

03:29.219 --> 03:30.969
Can't you see it?

03:33.510 --> 03:35.258
After I just climbed that fucking hill,

03:35.259 --> 03:37.719
are you being serious right now?

03:41.302 --> 03:43.671
In a few weeks time,

03:44.259 --> 03:48.052
I will lead a pirate fleet of
unprecedented strength over that horizon

03:48.136 --> 03:51.011
into a battle of
unprecedented importance.

03:53.259 --> 03:55.094
With a little luck,

03:55.178 --> 03:59.259
that battle will end with us taking
Nassau and beginning a revolution.

04:01.259 --> 04:03.594
I cannot do it without you.

04:05.802 --> 04:09.719
So it would benefit all
involved, you not the least,

04:09.802 --> 04:12.802
if, when the battle begins, you
aren't killed by the first fool

04:12.827 --> 04:15.427
lucky enough to swing a sword your way.

04:17.259 --> 04:19.257
You wanna teach me to fight?

04:19.259 --> 04:21.052
I know you know how to fight.

04:21.077 --> 04:24.224
I want to teach you how
to fight and not die.

04:27.606 --> 04:29.880
You'll have more control with that.

04:31.615 --> 04:34.302
I know how you feel about
being seen without the leg,

04:34.327 --> 04:37.122
but when the fighting truly begins,

04:37.147 --> 04:39.774
all that matters is what
makes for the greatest...

04:41.594 --> 04:43.568
advantage.

04:45.343 --> 04:47.130
The men...

04:48.149 --> 04:50.255
I have to manage how they see me.

04:52.052 --> 04:54.810
I understand that's part of my job.

04:55.635 --> 04:58.708
But for pride to be an
issue between you and I...

04:59.260 --> 05:01.258
well, I...

05:01.259 --> 05:03.385
I think we're playing past that by now.

05:03.469 --> 05:04.965
Don't you?

05:05.719 --> 05:07.094
Hmm.

05:22.385 --> 05:24.219
Do you really imagine
a few weeks of this

05:24.259 --> 05:26.343
is going to make much of a difference?

05:26.427 --> 05:28.969
Am I not what I am at this point?

05:29.052 --> 05:31.094
It's better than nothing.

05:34.178 --> 05:35.341
Right.

05:38.802 --> 05:40.887
You're not concerned about this?

05:41.687 --> 05:43.104
Concerned?

05:44.469 --> 05:47.259
Well, you say you'll
be teaching me to fight.

05:47.343 --> 05:49.886
But if every man fights differently,

05:49.969 --> 05:52.258
seems to me what you'll
really be teaching me

05:52.313 --> 05:54.152
is how to defeat you.

05:58.136 --> 06:00.155
I'll take my chances.

06:01.052 --> 06:02.577
Shall we?

06:41.342 --> 06:43.045
Tell me you know where they are.

06:43.070 --> 06:46.552
Laid eyes on Flint and the other
just as we entered the trees.

06:46.635 --> 06:49.219
At some distance, but we saw them.

06:49.259 --> 06:50.920
Sent the men after them.

06:50.945 --> 06:52.719
Carrying that chest, they won't get far.

06:52.802 --> 06:55.967
Well, Flint doesn't need to get far.

06:56.326 --> 07:00.443
All he needs is to bury that gold
somewhere unknown and he's won.

07:01.259 --> 07:03.178
How long did he give you?

07:03.259 --> 07:04.857
The governor.

07:04.882 --> 07:08.052
He said I have till sunrise
tomorrow to return the cache.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.343
But I don't think we're
going to have that long.

07:10.427 --> 07:13.131
He gave me the time for
his benefit, not mine.

07:13.156 --> 07:15.385
He's preparing to make a move.

07:16.969 --> 07:19.969
I know not what, but
he's preparing for it.

07:20.052 --> 07:22.469
And there's little I can do
about it until I secure that chest

07:22.552 --> 07:24.389
and have it to bargain with.

07:48.078 --> 07:50.632
Which one of them is going to prevail?

07:53.259 --> 07:54.835
Which one?

07:55.625 --> 07:58.427
Mr. Silver assures me he can
retrieve the cache from Flint

07:58.452 --> 08:02.007
and resume our transaction
on its original terms.

08:02.260 --> 08:05.492
If he is incorrect...

08:06.594 --> 08:09.810
I will have some
difficult choices to make.

08:10.886 --> 08:12.904
You know the two of them.

08:12.929 --> 08:14.746
Now that they're facing
each other as opponents,

08:14.771 --> 08:18.136
I'm asking what sort of
outcome I should expect.

08:19.510 --> 08:21.545
Silver has the men.

08:21.719 --> 08:23.427
And...

08:23.510 --> 08:26.623
Flint is on his own out
there and disadvantaged.

08:30.415 --> 08:32.148
That said...

08:33.342 --> 08:34.885
Flint's been on his
own and disadvantaged

08:34.969 --> 08:37.140
countless times since I've known him.

08:39.135 --> 08:40.780
And here we are.

08:44.995 --> 08:47.269
Suppose what I'm saying is...

08:48.338 --> 08:51.418
if I were you, I would
assume the worst...

08:52.594 --> 08:55.912
and act accordingly now
while you know you still can.

09:04.427 --> 09:08.006
My Lord, the mist is heavy.

09:08.505 --> 09:11.964
It may be our best chance to
move with minimal casualties.

09:26.594 --> 09:28.817
I'd like to see her again.

09:30.052 --> 09:31.343
She'll never accept your offer.

09:31.427 --> 09:32.969
You are, for now,

09:33.052 --> 09:35.927
a necessary evil here.

09:36.011 --> 09:38.137
Do not test my patience.

09:41.719 --> 09:43.790
Bring her up from below.

09:43.882 --> 09:45.149
Now.

10:03.427 --> 10:05.258
What's this?

10:05.259 --> 10:08.593
We tracked him this far,
but the trail splits in two.

10:08.594 --> 10:10.968
Well, it seems he may
intend to divide our numbers,

10:10.969 --> 10:12.760
improve his chances.

10:12.761 --> 10:15.258
If they say you know his
mind as if it were your own,

10:15.259 --> 10:17.129
we thought you might have a better idea

10:17.154 --> 10:19.152
which way he went than we could.

10:19.886 --> 10:23.292
How in the fuck would I know
which way he decided to go?

10:23.427 --> 10:26.519
All Flint needs is an hour, maybe less,

10:26.544 --> 10:29.310
to conceal that chest in a way
we couldn't hope to recover.

10:29.385 --> 10:31.258
Every moment we stand here deliberating

10:31.259 --> 10:33.917
is a moment closer to his victory.

10:34.259 --> 10:36.267
The three of you, that way.

10:36.292 --> 10:38.589
You, the other trail now!

10:47.886 --> 10:49.676
He's right.

10:49.677 --> 10:53.595
Flint likely seeks to separate
them, gain an advantage.

10:54.094 --> 10:55.835
I know.

10:57.705 --> 10:59.676
So it's likely you've just sent

10:59.677 --> 11:02.378
one of those two groups to their death.

11:03.886 --> 11:06.556
As long as they expose his position.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.502
I wonder if he knows...

11:11.552 --> 11:13.958
just how much you learned from him.

11:33.969 --> 11:35.258
Your opponent's wrist

11:35.259 --> 11:37.885
is from whence the attack is born.

11:37.886 --> 11:42.152
It is its past tense from
which it cannot separate itself.

11:42.761 --> 11:45.968
The end of the blade,
where the attack arrives,

11:45.969 --> 11:47.507
is its present tense,

11:47.532 --> 11:49.732
which also cannot be denied.

11:50.761 --> 11:52.593
You're still watching my eyes,

11:52.594 --> 11:55.044
which is a good way of
getting yourself killed.

11:56.052 --> 11:57.551
How exactly is one supposed to watch

11:57.552 --> 11:59.738
two points in space at the same time?

11:59.955 --> 12:01.238
Practice.

12:02.260 --> 12:03.968
All warfare is the same.

12:03.969 --> 12:06.259
Two questions are of
paramount importance...

12:06.260 --> 12:08.218
who was my opponent yesterday,

12:08.219 --> 12:09.509
and who is he today?

12:09.510 --> 12:12.941
Answer those two questions, and
there is very little he can...

12:17.594 --> 12:19.627
hide from you.

12:22.219 --> 12:23.752
What?

12:26.238 --> 12:28.522
Who you were.

12:32.497 --> 12:34.753
I have no idea who you were.

12:37.445 --> 12:39.683
Not before we found you, at any rate.

12:40.421 --> 12:42.463
Jesus Christ,

12:42.488 --> 12:44.136
don't do that.

12:44.161 --> 12:46.558
If you want to know where
I come from, just ask.

12:48.445 --> 12:50.445
I think I just did.

12:53.092 --> 12:55.215
You know all there is to know.

12:55.755 --> 12:59.218
I was born in Whitechapel,
never knew my mother.

13:00.445 --> 13:02.444
I had a wholly unremarkable youth.

13:02.445 --> 13:04.101
- Spent most of it at a home for...
- Home for boys.

13:04.126 --> 13:05.773
I know, I know.

13:06.445 --> 13:10.968
You, uh... you told me once or
twice of your experiences there.

13:12.343 --> 13:14.645
Except it isn't true.

13:15.529 --> 13:17.188
Is it?

13:19.445 --> 13:21.201
Why would you say that?

13:22.193 --> 13:24.154
I remember when you first told me,

13:24.155 --> 13:26.444
it sounded like a... invention.

13:28.023 --> 13:29.771
About one story that bled into others

13:29.796 --> 13:32.412
I'd heard told elsewhere to the crew.

13:34.185 --> 13:35.568
I didn't think much of it at the time.

13:35.623 --> 13:39.705
I suppose I assumed that if you
ever became somebody worth knowing,

13:39.706 --> 13:42.287
I'd learn the truth of it eventually.

13:42.288 --> 13:43.872
Only...

13:44.217 --> 13:47.084
in this moment, I'm
realizing that never happened.

13:51.248 --> 13:54.383
And what is of some
concern to me is that...

13:54.964 --> 13:58.735
despite how invested we each
are in the future of the other...

13:59.956 --> 14:02.448
you just told me that story again.

14:05.429 --> 14:07.094
Why is that?

14:16.452 --> 14:18.531
It isn't important.

14:20.956 --> 14:22.613
All right.

14:23.748 --> 14:26.918
Although, you know
that isn't true either.

14:28.563 --> 14:30.290
Why isn't it true?

14:32.060 --> 14:34.968
I'm sorry, the more I
try and dismiss this, I...

14:42.648 --> 14:44.594
You know my story.

14:46.165 --> 14:49.894
Thomas, Miranda, all of it.

14:50.159 --> 14:53.622
Know the role it played in motivating me

14:53.623 --> 14:55.039
to do the things that I've done,

14:55.040 --> 14:56.864
the things I will do.

14:59.123 --> 15:01.281
It has made me transparent to you.

15:04.893 --> 15:07.122
Not only that, but when
I told you this story,

15:07.123 --> 15:11.287
you insinuated yourself into it.

15:11.455 --> 15:14.039
The latest in a line
of ill-fated partners,

15:14.040 --> 15:16.705
situating yourself such that...

15:16.730 --> 15:20.014
were you and I ever to come to blows...

15:23.706 --> 15:27.031
I'd be forced to hesitate
before doing you any harm.

15:29.425 --> 15:32.247
- Slow down, I...
- I'm not angry with you.

15:32.248 --> 15:33.823
It's just...

15:35.288 --> 15:37.399
you know my story.

15:38.414 --> 15:40.622
And for some reason, I cannot figure...

15:40.623 --> 15:43.040
I don't want you to know mine.

15:51.123 --> 15:52.984
Wait a minute.

15:53.312 --> 15:55.038
I...

15:55.830 --> 15:57.287
I understand your concern.

15:57.288 --> 15:59.323
I just...

16:03.706 --> 16:06.488
We'll resume tomorrow.
Is that all right?

16:27.664 --> 16:29.460
We found him.

16:31.288 --> 16:33.330
I don't see the chest.

16:33.713 --> 16:36.080
Track marks go back 200 yards.

16:36.956 --> 16:38.906
He dragged it here.

16:41.498 --> 16:43.488
Should we fetch Mr. Hands?

17:57.956 --> 17:59.864
We should head back.

19:28.135 --> 19:30.127
You sailed with Avery.

19:34.891 --> 19:36.723
Long time ago.

19:36.748 --> 19:38.365
20 years?

19:39.288 --> 19:41.982
More, even, maybe?

19:42.288 --> 19:44.413
More, aye.

19:44.414 --> 19:46.031
Mm-hmm.

19:48.456 --> 19:51.448
You do know where you're going, yes?

19:57.570 --> 20:00.312
No, seriously, I've got
quite a lot riding on this.

20:01.539 --> 20:04.622
One day, you'll leave the account.

20:04.831 --> 20:08.630
Take a wife, father children.

20:09.165 --> 20:11.330
See less and less of the sea

20:11.331 --> 20:15.580
until she becomes like a
painting hanging on the wall,

20:15.581 --> 20:18.817
static and irrelevant...

20:19.126 --> 20:21.409
to your daily existence.

20:24.165 --> 20:26.436
But she'll keep on calling you.

20:28.077 --> 20:30.287
And when she does,

20:30.288 --> 20:32.288
you'll step into that painting

20:32.313 --> 20:36.225
and feel the swell beneath your feet.

20:36.748 --> 20:38.747
It'll all come back

20:38.748 --> 20:41.319
as if it were like yesterday.

20:42.492 --> 20:44.233
Is that so?

20:47.660 --> 20:49.705
I've watched you and yours

20:49.706 --> 20:53.715
handle the account
since I and mine left it.

20:54.581 --> 20:58.830
Accomplish things that
no one I ever sailed with

20:58.831 --> 21:00.645
could dream of.

21:01.807 --> 21:04.389
From what I've overheard,

21:04.414 --> 21:07.098
if you reach Skeleton Island,

21:07.498 --> 21:09.902
might mean the end of the governor.

21:12.068 --> 21:16.359
Maybe keep the account
alive a little while longer.

21:17.831 --> 21:19.488
Is that so?

21:20.823 --> 21:23.921
That and more.

21:28.372 --> 21:30.904
Then I'll take you to it.

21:31.288 --> 21:34.600
Hold on to this for as long as you can,

21:35.040 --> 21:37.830
for all of us who once had it...

21:37.831 --> 21:39.864
and walked away.

22:03.395 --> 22:06.511
You have no idea the
restraint this takes.

22:10.288 --> 22:13.674
How urgent the instinct
towards violence.

22:14.439 --> 22:17.747
How certain the conviction
that it would be deserved,

22:17.748 --> 22:21.088
given what you and your
partners have destroyed,

22:22.289 --> 22:24.471
what you've taken from me.

22:29.706 --> 22:31.371
To me,

22:31.372 --> 22:35.139
compromise seems a
loathsome, unbearable act.

22:36.581 --> 22:38.288
What compromise can there be

22:38.289 --> 22:41.698
with the man responsible
for the death of my wife?

22:44.288 --> 22:47.194
Or with those who would follow him?

22:52.873 --> 22:55.371
You're luckier than you know...

23:00.998 --> 23:03.520
so much luckier than you know

23:04.288 --> 23:08.164
that in this moment I can still hear
the faintest of voices in my head

23:08.165 --> 23:10.663
arguing against the alternative.

23:14.498 --> 23:17.695
If I must compromise
to avert a dark end,

23:18.831 --> 23:20.875
then so must you.

23:22.873 --> 23:24.830
I've offered you
freedom for your people.

23:24.855 --> 23:28.844
I have offered you more than
you have any right to expect.

23:28.873 --> 23:31.656
And still, you will not say yes.

23:33.288 --> 23:35.987
So I come to you one last time,

23:36.012 --> 23:38.377
to ensure you cannot say no.

23:41.081 --> 23:44.080
- Accept the treaty...
- I will consider no treaty of yours.

23:44.081 --> 23:46.308
... and John Silver lives.

23:49.289 --> 23:51.006
Refuse...

23:52.987 --> 23:54.615
and he dies...

23:56.081 --> 23:58.982
along with the rest of the
men who followed him here.

24:01.081 --> 24:03.313
And from what I understand,

24:03.688 --> 24:06.548
he is the one who matters most to you.

24:07.173 --> 24:09.287
The one with whom you might lead a life

24:09.288 --> 24:12.488
if you can set aside
your pride in this moment.

24:18.288 --> 24:21.521
Do not make the same mistake I did.

24:23.915 --> 24:25.864
Do the deal.

24:28.873 --> 24:31.930
The voice you hear in your head...

24:33.664 --> 24:36.455
I imagine I know who it sounds like,

24:36.516 --> 24:39.570
as I know Eleanor wanted those things.

24:40.207 --> 24:42.287
But I hear other voices.

24:44.803 --> 24:46.836
A chorus of voices.

24:47.831 --> 24:49.739
Multitudes.

24:51.539 --> 24:53.945
They reach back centuries.

24:56.539 --> 24:59.371
Men and women...

24:59.372 --> 25:02.287
and children who'd lost their lives...

25:02.288 --> 25:04.128
to men like you.

25:05.915 --> 25:08.371
Men and women and children

25:08.372 --> 25:10.572
forced to wear your chains.

25:12.056 --> 25:14.214
I must answer to them

25:14.539 --> 25:16.323
and this war...

25:17.288 --> 25:18.914
their war...

25:18.915 --> 25:20.705
Flint's war...

25:21.277 --> 25:23.058
my war...

25:24.165 --> 25:27.286
it will not be bargained
away to avoid a fight,

25:28.539 --> 25:31.287
to save John Silver's life...

25:31.288 --> 25:33.340
or his men's...

25:33.748 --> 25:35.262
or mine.

25:37.288 --> 25:39.664
And you believe what you will,

25:40.288 --> 25:43.937
but it was neither I nor Flint...

25:44.601 --> 25:47.320
nor the Spanish raider
who killed your wife.

25:49.288 --> 25:52.287
That, you did.

26:01.773 --> 26:03.333
Sergeant.

26:09.706 --> 26:11.488
Take her below.

26:27.706 --> 26:29.622
- Are your men ready?
- They are, my Lord.

26:29.623 --> 26:31.207
Then we move now.

26:31.232 --> 26:32.848
Ready the launches.

27:02.288 --> 27:04.729
- Any sign of them?
- No.

27:04.754 --> 27:07.722
Nor the chest, nor any trail for either.

27:09.956 --> 27:13.143
- We should move.
- Move where?

27:13.972 --> 27:17.305
Flint's almost certainly
disposed of the cache by now.

27:17.635 --> 27:21.031
For all we know, he's headed
back to the Walrus as we speak.

27:21.456 --> 27:23.997
Leverages his sole knowledge
of the chest's location

27:23.998 --> 27:25.872
to gain control of the men.

27:25.873 --> 27:29.297
Then maybe attempts to
rescue Madi, maybe not.

27:29.581 --> 27:32.250
Maybe he's already factored
her death into this.

27:32.998 --> 27:35.323
A martyr to feed the cause.

27:37.994 --> 27:39.652
Fuck him...

27:41.294 --> 27:44.293
for dictating this outcome to me,

27:44.498 --> 27:47.754
for swearing his
friendship falsely to me,

27:48.623 --> 27:50.629
for his arrogance,

27:51.210 --> 27:53.090
his indifference.

27:54.998 --> 27:57.407
So, what are you gonna do about it?

27:59.790 --> 28:02.121
You've been warned so many times...

28:02.146 --> 28:04.973
by Billy, by me, by Flint's own actions.

28:04.998 --> 28:08.263
And despite that, despite this,

28:08.288 --> 28:10.789
I think when we meet him again,

28:10.790 --> 28:14.666
you will look for reasons
to forget it all again.

28:14.691 --> 28:18.287
You've come all this way,
traveled all this distance,

28:18.288 --> 28:19.857
and when he starts talking,

28:19.882 --> 28:22.379
you won't have learned a goddamn thing.

28:28.508 --> 28:30.681
We've come all this way.

28:33.220 --> 28:35.720
How far are we from
where the paths split?

28:36.081 --> 28:37.538
Hm.

28:37.539 --> 28:39.876
Two hundred yards, give or take.

28:40.288 --> 28:41.572
More.

28:45.289 --> 28:47.190
He never would have got
this far ahead of your men

28:47.215 --> 28:48.955
carrying that chest.

28:50.873 --> 28:53.156
The chest was never here.

28:55.956 --> 28:57.765
He left it behind.

29:10.706 --> 29:13.216
You think they'll figure it out
that we dropped it down here?

29:14.248 --> 29:16.287
We need to get it in the ground.

29:16.288 --> 29:17.656
Come on.

29:27.873 --> 29:30.287
Heard some talk in the
camp before we left.

29:30.288 --> 29:33.287
They were talking about what
happens when it's over...

29:33.288 --> 29:35.287
if the war ends up what
everyone says it will be...

29:35.288 --> 29:38.329
about the spoils we all
stand to gain from it.

29:38.706 --> 29:41.680
But what you're talking about
is bigger than that, isn't it?

29:43.288 --> 29:45.747
But if we succeed...
if we are to succeed

29:45.748 --> 29:48.872
and leave this island
with the alliance intact,

29:48.873 --> 29:50.622
I'm having a hard time
seeing how Mr. Silver

29:50.623 --> 29:52.792
can be a part of that now.

29:52.985 --> 29:54.698
He'll come round.

29:55.081 --> 29:56.872
Once she's safe,

29:56.873 --> 29:59.955
then he'll be able to
see things clearly again.

29:59.956 --> 30:01.330
I hope so.

30:01.331 --> 30:04.190
If not, if he needs to go...

30:06.706 --> 30:08.182
You're too important to what comes next

30:08.207 --> 30:10.463
to have to bear a burden like that.

30:12.943 --> 30:15.314
So, when the time comes, I'll do it.

30:24.715 --> 30:26.287
Fuck!

30:26.288 --> 30:28.080
You're still leaning forward.

30:28.105 --> 30:29.972
Let's go again.

30:35.165 --> 30:37.287
I have no story to tell.

30:45.288 --> 30:46.705
It all might seem as though I'm trying

30:46.706 --> 30:48.906
to conceal something from you, but...

30:50.264 --> 30:52.534
truth is...

30:53.248 --> 30:55.488
there is no story to tell.

30:59.542 --> 31:02.159
No one's past is that unremarkable.

31:05.123 --> 31:07.365
Not unremarkable, just...

31:09.165 --> 31:10.698
without relevance.

31:18.796 --> 31:20.622
A long time ago, I absolved myself

31:20.623 --> 31:22.850
from the obligation of finding any.

31:23.623 --> 31:26.789
No need to account for
all my life's events

31:26.790 --> 31:29.830
in the context of a
story that somehow...

31:29.831 --> 31:31.593
defines me.

31:32.456 --> 31:35.968
Events, some of which, no one
could divine any meaning from...

31:37.081 --> 31:40.663
other than that the world is
a place of unending horrors.

31:45.748 --> 31:48.370
I've come to peace with the knowledge...

31:48.790 --> 31:51.034
that there is no storyteller

31:51.706 --> 31:54.089
imposing any coherence,

31:54.706 --> 31:58.050
nor sense, nor grace upon those events.

31:59.165 --> 32:03.240
Therefore, there's no duty
on my part to search for it.

32:04.790 --> 32:07.995
You know of me all I
can bear to be known.

32:08.929 --> 32:11.261
All that is relevant to be known.

32:13.040 --> 32:16.605
That is to say, you know
my genuine friendship...

32:16.630 --> 32:18.287
and loyalty.

32:25.763 --> 32:28.796
Can that be enough and there
still be trust between us?

32:44.029 --> 32:45.300
Again.

33:07.811 --> 33:09.975
We're nearing the turn point.

33:10.288 --> 33:11.705
Good.

33:11.706 --> 33:13.914
That's good.

33:13.915 --> 33:15.997
Once the range marks align,

33:15.998 --> 33:18.287
we'll have a sense what
direction we're to head in

33:18.288 --> 33:20.073
to reach the island.

33:22.331 --> 33:25.122
How far out, do you think?

33:25.123 --> 33:26.371
Oh...

33:26.372 --> 33:28.287
could be a few days,

33:28.288 --> 33:30.407
maybe less.

33:35.664 --> 33:38.771
When we sailed for the Urca gold,

33:39.207 --> 33:42.092
I remember something of this feeling.

33:42.511 --> 33:44.836
So much to be gained.

33:46.248 --> 33:49.371
But this is different, isn't it?

33:49.372 --> 33:50.580
How so?

33:50.581 --> 33:52.762
Well, then,

33:53.207 --> 33:55.330
even a complete and thorough success

33:55.331 --> 33:58.028
meant a qualified victory.

33:58.288 --> 34:00.206
On some level, whether we were prepared

34:00.207 --> 34:01.789
to acknowledge it out loud or not,

34:01.790 --> 34:04.075
I believe we both knew the
fortune would likely cause

34:04.100 --> 34:06.789
as many problems as it would solve.

34:06.790 --> 34:08.572
But now,

34:08.598 --> 34:12.206
if that man out there can
fulfill his promise to us,

34:12.206 --> 34:15.739
if we can prevail over
Flint and the governor...

34:15.764 --> 34:18.324
and I feel we can...

34:18.956 --> 34:22.067
I don't know why, but I feel it.

34:23.371 --> 34:25.364
Am I mad?

34:25.790 --> 34:27.848
Tell me. I'm asking.

34:30.043 --> 34:32.371
I don't think you are.

34:32.748 --> 34:34.348
I've...

34:35.288 --> 34:37.737
thought the same thing.

34:39.664 --> 34:41.996
The result ahead of us...

34:41.998 --> 34:44.039
promises to be a victory...

34:44.040 --> 34:45.989
of a different sort.

34:47.414 --> 34:50.487
A true victory.

34:51.956 --> 34:53.614
Freedom...

34:55.331 --> 34:57.531
in every sense of the word.

35:01.539 --> 35:04.809
How many men in the history of
the world have ever known it?

35:07.664 --> 35:10.903
How remarkable a moment is this?

35:11.325 --> 35:14.413
How fortunate are we to be
standing on the threshold of it?

35:16.147 --> 35:17.575
Yes?

35:22.631 --> 35:24.166
What is it?

35:38.456 --> 35:41.805
James said he saw him
clutch for his chest.

35:41.830 --> 35:44.696
Then... he just dropped.

35:47.110 --> 35:48.720
Mm-hmm.

35:59.210 --> 36:00.703
Mm-hmm.

36:03.835 --> 36:06.046
- Should we...?
- Mm-hmm.

36:06.998 --> 36:09.077
His heart gave out.

36:12.581 --> 36:15.287
So, you asked him to recount for you

36:15.288 --> 36:17.035
what he knew days ago, yes?

36:17.060 --> 36:19.586
- Of course.
- 'Course you did. Good.

36:20.414 --> 36:24.488
And you can get us to our destination
without his assistance, yes?

36:25.289 --> 36:27.134
His heart gave out!

36:27.159 --> 36:30.318
Do not fuck with me.

36:32.748 --> 36:35.287
Of course I can, truly.

36:35.288 --> 36:37.922
I'm almost certain I can figure it out.

36:47.390 --> 36:49.976
Get the fuck up and sail.

37:00.288 --> 37:02.140
All is well?

37:04.248 --> 37:06.281
I thought I heard it.

37:09.766 --> 37:11.674
Thought you heard what?

37:15.288 --> 37:17.018
A woman.

37:17.498 --> 37:19.864
Or what sounded like a woman.

37:21.998 --> 37:23.862
Wailing...

37:23.887 --> 37:26.098
just faintly from the trees.

37:33.695 --> 37:37.514
Mr. Wallis swears he saw a mermaid

37:37.539 --> 37:39.373
swimming beneath the surface.

37:41.207 --> 37:43.287
Mr. Jones heard the voice of his mother

37:43.288 --> 37:46.258
accusing him of
infidelity to her memory.

37:46.414 --> 37:49.287
The mind is prone to
mischief, I suppose.

37:49.288 --> 37:50.497
Mm-hmm.

37:50.498 --> 37:53.206
Especially in a place like this...

37:53.231 --> 37:55.336
remote and...

37:56.289 --> 37:58.323
full of stories.

38:00.845 --> 38:03.628
There are no monsters in the dark...

38:05.155 --> 38:07.232
though there are dangers.

38:08.915 --> 38:11.387
Let's take care to tell the difference.

38:11.915 --> 38:14.488
Lay our attention on the latter.

40:37.998 --> 40:39.365
Fuck!

42:47.790 --> 42:49.497
Hey, the hold's on fire!

42:49.498 --> 42:50.730
What happened?

42:55.499 --> 42:57.518
Men in the water!

42:59.623 --> 43:01.643
Launches in the water!

43:03.146 --> 43:05.311
From the Eurydice!

43:05.336 --> 43:06.940
Oh, good God.

43:13.248 --> 43:15.729
Don't wait for me! Go!

43:41.248 --> 43:43.240
They'll be upon us soon.

43:47.569 --> 43:49.676
You'll have to put it in the ground.

43:53.998 --> 43:55.817
Can you do it?

43:57.706 --> 43:59.488
I'll stall them.

44:15.207 --> 44:16.906
Jesus!

44:23.386 --> 44:25.264
We need to get above.

44:25.636 --> 44:28.288
You said our only chance of saving
the ship is to flood this hold.

44:28.289 --> 44:30.120
It's too far gone.

44:30.145 --> 44:33.370
In a couple of minutes that
fire will reach the magazine.

44:33.682 --> 44:35.542
What choice do we have?

44:36.552 --> 44:37.967
Abandon ship.

44:38.339 --> 44:39.372
Abandon ship!

44:39.397 --> 44:41.597
- Abandon ship!
- All hands!

45:17.664 --> 45:19.287
It would be preferable to me

45:19.288 --> 45:21.878
if we resolved this another way.

45:26.790 --> 45:29.031
Cache is in the ground by now.

45:30.902 --> 45:32.955
And I'll need as many men as we can get

45:32.956 --> 45:35.003
for what comes next.

45:35.508 --> 45:38.199
That includes you.

45:48.873 --> 45:51.172
He'll be here in a moment.

45:54.331 --> 45:58.287
You still think you'll persuade
him to see this all your way?

45:59.873 --> 46:01.531
I don't think so.

46:02.998 --> 46:05.287
But I'd prefer not to find out.

46:34.664 --> 46:36.287
That's enough!

46:44.288 --> 46:46.031
Tell me where it is.

46:46.056 --> 46:48.164
- I can't do that.
- Fuck you! Where is it?

46:48.165 --> 46:50.477
- You're making a mistake.
- Fuck you! Where is it?

46:50.502 --> 46:51.911
In the ground...

46:54.944 --> 46:57.751
where it stays until Madi is freed,

46:57.956 --> 47:00.948
and we gather it and return
it to the camp, all of us.

47:06.958 --> 47:09.696
I know you cannot see why this must be.

47:10.376 --> 47:12.290
But it must be.

47:12.695 --> 47:14.743
And every moment we waste is a moment

47:14.831 --> 47:17.122
we could be working to retrieve her.

47:17.123 --> 47:19.789
That's all this has ever been, isn't it?

47:19.985 --> 47:22.524
A partnership only
insofar as it enables you

47:22.549 --> 47:25.782
to do whatever it is that matters
to you in any given moment.

47:26.102 --> 47:29.413
And right now it matters far less
to you whether she lives or dies

47:29.414 --> 47:33.101
than it happens your way, on your terms.

47:33.126 --> 47:36.413
I think you know it's far
more complicated than that.

47:36.414 --> 47:38.448
I'm certain she does.

47:42.704 --> 47:44.134
Hup!

47:45.001 --> 47:47.287
Even if you could kill me,

47:47.288 --> 47:49.914
even if that somehow helped
you see her alive again,

47:49.915 --> 47:52.462
how are you going to explain it to her?

47:53.032 --> 47:55.622
She believes in this as much as I do.

47:55.623 --> 47:57.287
You know this.

47:57.454 --> 47:59.872
If it costs the war to save her,

47:59.873 --> 48:01.845
you'll have lost her anyway.

48:02.706 --> 48:04.789
Even you cannot construct a story

48:04.790 --> 48:06.993
to make her forgive you that.

48:13.576 --> 48:14.993
You do this,

48:15.018 --> 48:17.010
and you're gonna regret it.

48:42.248 --> 48:44.407
No! Don't!

49:45.220 --> 49:48.798
Swim for the shore!
Try to reach the shore!

49:51.495 --> 49:53.828
Get to the shore! Away from the ship!

50:50.694 --> 50:52.794
Can't you see it?

50:59.460 --> 51:02.786
It isn't utility that's
behind his investment in me...

51:03.956 --> 51:06.488
nor necessity, nor dependency.

51:09.706 --> 51:12.407
I understand you fear a false motive.

51:13.372 --> 51:15.948
But this much is clear to me now...

51:18.288 --> 51:20.488
I have earned his respect.

51:24.288 --> 51:27.488
And after all the tragedies
that man has suffered...

51:30.288 --> 51:32.287
the loss of Thomas,

51:32.288 --> 51:34.488
the events of Charles Town...

51:43.729 --> 51:45.986
I have earned his trust.

51:47.750 --> 51:50.031
I have his true friendship...

51:55.296 --> 51:57.831
and so he's going to have mine.

51:59.664 --> 52:02.309
And as long as that is true,

52:03.288 --> 52:05.864
I cannot imagine what is possible.
