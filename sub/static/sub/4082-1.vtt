WEBVTT

00:26.484 --> 00:34.950
l AM LOVE

02:55.341 --> 02:58.635
Madam, your son told me
he is bringing a guest.

02:59.637 --> 03:02.139
- A guest?
- Yes. A girl...

03:16.738 --> 03:18.989
So, we have Gratieni
and his wife here,

03:21.075 --> 03:22.242
Betta and Gregorio--

03:25.496 --> 03:27.206
probably... here.

03:28.374 --> 03:31.710
- Between Edo and Delfina.
- Yes.

03:31.878 --> 03:35.005
She should sit next to Edoardo.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.257
She doesn't know anyone.

03:42.805 --> 03:45.515
- ls Edo back?
- Not yet.

03:48.144 --> 03:50.979
- Any news on the race?
- He came in second.

03:51.147 --> 03:52.648
Second?

03:52.815 --> 03:56.276
The snow, Grandpa's birthday,
Edo losing a race...

03:57.612 --> 03:59.821
Three events in just one day!

04:06.246 --> 04:08.997
Maybe this year we'll be spared
Edo's dish.

04:09.165 --> 04:11.208
What do you say, Betta?

04:11.376 --> 04:13.877
Your sister's in a bad mood today.

04:14.921 --> 04:18.507
- What's for breakfast?
- Thanks, lda.

04:31.020 --> 04:35.357
He's never this late.
He must really like this girl!

04:35.525 --> 04:37.484
Hi, Anita.

04:37.652 --> 04:40.862
- Good morning, lda.
- Good morning, Edoardo.

04:41.030 --> 04:43.824
- Good morning, Liliana.
- Good morning, Mr. Edoardo.

04:55.378 --> 04:58.630
Here you are, my love.

04:58.798 --> 05:03.093
- Thanks for the soup, Mama.
- l have to add some saffron.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.595
- Who is she?
- Be nice to her, she's really shy.

05:05.763 --> 05:08.765
Her name is Eva.

05:08.933 --> 05:11.101
lda is a little jealous.

05:38.671 --> 05:41.214
Edo lost the race today.

05:41.382 --> 05:44.217
He'll have more time
to concentrate on work.

05:44.385 --> 05:46.803
Good morning, Madam.
Good morning, Sir.

05:46.971 --> 05:50.515
- How are you, lda?
- Very well, thank you. And you?

05:50.683 --> 05:53.352
- You look well.
- Thank you.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.398
Happy birthday.

06:00.401 --> 06:03.195
- Good morning.
- How are you?

06:03.363 --> 06:06.198
Very well, Madam.
And you?

06:06.366 --> 06:08.784
We've been through happier times.

06:16.793 --> 06:19.044
Look how they've grown.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.341
Grandpa!

06:24.509 --> 06:27.469
Elisabetta, how are you?

06:27.637 --> 06:28.804
Fine.

06:28.971 --> 06:31.473
- Nothing for me?
- Happy birthday, Grandpa.

06:38.106 --> 06:40.107
They are here.

07:02.296 --> 07:03.964
When did you get back?

07:04.132 --> 07:05.757
l was a little late.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.843
Who did you lose to today?
Gregorio?

07:08.010 --> 07:11.847
No, to a guy l don't know.
l didn't lose, we tied.

07:12.014 --> 07:16.184
Why didn't you challenge
the judge's ruling?

07:16.352 --> 07:18.645
He deserved the victory.

07:21.023 --> 07:24.901
l spoke to your brother this morning.
lt's a pity you weren't there.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.701
Your grandfather's
in an excellent mood today.

07:32.869 --> 07:36.163
- ls this Eva from the Ugolini family?
- Yes, the poor side.

07:36.330 --> 07:40.625
Gianluca, you're even more of a snob
than your father.

07:40.793 --> 07:42.919
More than your grandmother!

07:44.046 --> 07:45.505
Hello, Grandpa. Happy birthday.

07:49.218 --> 07:51.261
lt surprises me

07:51.429 --> 07:56.266
that Tancredi gave it to Emma
as a wedding gift.

07:58.519 --> 08:02.856
Tell me, how did you manage
to lose today's race?

08:03.024 --> 08:07.694
lt was fixed.
They wanted him out of the running.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.238
l don't think so...

08:10.406 --> 08:12.532
- l was up against someone stronger.
- lmpossible!

08:12.700 --> 08:14.826
- The Recchis are unbeatable.
- That's right.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.878
The doctor said we shouldn't worry.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.672
He is fighting with all his strength

08:27.840 --> 08:30.634
and his heart is responding well.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.058
He has decided.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.940
l'm glad you lost the race.

08:46.442 --> 08:50.445
From now on you won't have
any further distractions.

08:50.613 --> 08:53.240
l want to go to London
to see Herzog and De Meuron.

08:53.407 --> 08:56.201
- Who?
- They designed the new Tate Gallery.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.203
The Tate Gallery?

08:58.371 --> 09:00.872
l want to give them the scaffolding
covers for the next project.

09:01.040 --> 09:05.085
- lt'd guarantee years of work.
- Are you sure?

09:43.958 --> 09:46.459
- Madam, you look beautiful.
- Thank you.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.848
- How are we doing here?
- Well.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.530
ls everything all right?

11:01.952 --> 11:06.748
Betta, Eva works in Atellani's,
the bookshop on Corso Magenta.

11:06.916 --> 11:10.126
The one below Grandpa's house?
l've never seen you there.

11:10.294 --> 11:14.089
l've not been there long.
l'm in the art department.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.809
- Where is Pierluigi?
- He's coming.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.773
Thank you.

11:44.078 --> 11:46.788
Not Edo's ukha dish again!
Enough!

11:47.790 --> 11:51.209
No, it's fabulous!
"Ton sur ton."

11:51.377 --> 11:53.002
You're right, Andrea.

11:53.170 --> 11:57.006
"Ton sur ton"
is better than "con sur con"!

12:00.177 --> 12:04.180
Eva, how did the race go?
You were there, right?

12:04.348 --> 12:06.933
The guy who beat Edo is a chef.

12:07.101 --> 12:09.185
- Do you know him?
- No.

12:09.353 --> 12:11.855
But his restaurant is in a building
owned by my family.

12:12.982 --> 12:16.526
- Beaten by a chef?
- lt wasn't fair.

12:16.694 --> 12:19.654
- Edo won.
- lf you say so...

14:15.604 --> 14:17.021
Shall we go?

14:18.899 --> 14:21.943
- Can l see it?
- Together with the others.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.444
Thanks.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.574
Let's go.

14:44.008 --> 14:47.427
May l have your attention?

14:47.595 --> 14:52.098
l have all of my granddaughter's
drawings on a wall.

14:52.266 --> 14:57.020
When she becomes a famous painter,
l'll have people pay to see them.

15:10.492 --> 15:12.201
What is this?

15:14.330 --> 15:17.790
l took it at the Hanbury Gardens.
You took me there.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.419
l want to move into photography now.

15:24.131 --> 15:26.007
l like it. lt's beautiful.

15:28.010 --> 15:31.971
Yes, l like it too.

15:33.682 --> 15:36.351
l'm just thrown by novelties.

15:36.518 --> 15:39.187
l don't think he likes it.

15:40.689 --> 15:44.317
You still owe me a drawing.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.235
Come here.

15:51.867 --> 15:53.743
l like it. lt's wonderful.

15:53.911 --> 15:56.704
Really.

16:23.524 --> 16:24.649
Thank you.

16:27.194 --> 16:28.695
For you.

16:31.198 --> 16:32.824
Thank you.

16:45.587 --> 16:47.588
My dear friends,

16:48.632 --> 16:50.425
l don't want to die

16:53.387 --> 16:54.512
and l won't

16:55.764 --> 16:58.599
as long as the business
carries on

16:58.767 --> 17:01.144
in the same spirit

17:01.311 --> 17:05.147
in which l created it.

17:09.028 --> 17:13.364
Our family's fortune
is built on the factory.

17:13.531 --> 17:16.826
Every brick, every man,

17:16.993 --> 17:19.162
every piece of material

17:19.329 --> 17:22.330
is living proof

17:22.499 --> 17:26.377
of what we have been.

17:26.545 --> 17:31.340
We engraved our name
in our country's history

17:31.508 --> 17:34.594
when, both during the war
and after,

17:34.762 --> 17:37.638
we were able to tend to its needs

17:37.806 --> 17:41.809
with our factory's constant,
busy activity.

17:42.811 --> 17:47.356
The company was born Recchi,
and Recchi it must remain forever.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.447
The time has come

17:54.615 --> 17:58.326
for me to retire

17:58.494 --> 18:01.996
and name my successor.

18:07.377 --> 18:10.379
My son has always lived up

18:10.547 --> 18:12.882
to my expectations.

18:13.050 --> 18:16.552
l knew he would from the moment
l first held him in my arms.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.223
Thank you, Tancredi,

18:20.390 --> 18:23.267
for having been
the son l always wanted

18:23.435 --> 18:27.939
and for having created
such a marvelous family.

18:29.525 --> 18:33.111
l see qualities in your children...

18:33.278 --> 18:37.156
that will lead them
to live intense

18:37.324 --> 18:40.952
and fruitful lives, as l have.

18:42.746 --> 18:45.957
Of course, my grandson
had to choose this day

18:46.125 --> 18:50.503
of all days to interrupt
our family's athletic tradition!

19:00.806 --> 19:03.015
Therefore...

19:06.353 --> 19:08.980
l have decided to leave

19:11.567 --> 19:14.402
everything in your hands, Tancredi.

19:24.079 --> 19:27.248
And in your son Edoardo's.

19:36.258 --> 19:39.927
lt will take two men
to replace me!

19:42.848 --> 19:47.310
Here's to Tancredi and Edoardo!

19:47.477 --> 19:49.353
To the Recchis!

19:55.611 --> 19:57.320
Come here, you winner!

20:03.452 --> 20:05.244
Go to the cellar.

20:05.412 --> 20:07.914
Bring two bottles of '49.

20:25.974 --> 20:28.184
Yes?

20:28.352 --> 20:31.145
lt's for Edoardo Recchi.

20:31.313 --> 20:34.023
- Can l take it?
- l'd prefer to deliver it myself.

20:34.191 --> 20:36.400
- Who are you?
- Antonio Biscaglia.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.402
One moment.

20:43.033 --> 20:44.492
This way.

20:45.786 --> 20:49.205
Follow the path. lt'll take you
to the entrance of the villa.

21:17.734 --> 21:19.819
lda, leave it.

21:26.493 --> 21:28.244
What are you doing here?

21:29.663 --> 21:33.207
That's the chef--
the one who beat Edo.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.001
Come in!

21:37.838 --> 21:40.673
l wanted to bring you a gift.

21:40.841 --> 21:43.342
A gift?

21:43.510 --> 21:46.887
For me? l get it. You're no longer
certain of your victory today.

21:47.055 --> 21:50.641
- You put up a good fight.
- Come in.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.310
lt's a special night for my family.

21:52.477 --> 21:56.564
l'd rather not, thanks.

21:56.732 --> 21:57.773
As you wish.

21:57.941 --> 22:02.486
l made you a cake.
l'm a chef.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.615
Mama!

22:06.783 --> 22:09.493
l want to show you something.

22:13.373 --> 22:16.959
- This is Antonio.
- Good evening.

22:17.127 --> 22:19.003
Look what he made for me.

22:20.005 --> 22:22.256
lsn't it a work of art? He made it.

22:22.424 --> 22:25.885
He's the guy that beat me today.
That's why he doesn't want to stay.

22:26.887 --> 22:29.388
- Please stay.
- lt doesn't matter, thanks.

22:30.390 --> 22:32.975
- Are you going to bed, Mama?
- Yes, my love.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.110
lda!

22:46.239 --> 22:49.492
l have to take this bottle
to Grandpa - don't let him leave!

22:51.661 --> 22:54.163
- Should the cake go in the fridge?
- No.

22:54.331 --> 22:56.082
Please, come in.

23:38.792 --> 23:42.378
SOME MONTHS LATER

24:14.619 --> 24:16.537
Good morning, Madam.

24:16.705 --> 24:19.665
- How is your son, Edo?
- Fine, thank you.

24:19.833 --> 24:22.710
- Just the blazer?
- Yes, only the blazer.

24:30.010 --> 24:34.305
l've managed to get rid
of those nasty stains.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.140
- lt's fine.
- Yes.

24:44.774 --> 24:46.525
This is for you.

24:46.693 --> 24:50.779
Wait, Mrs. Recchi, l found this.

24:52.324 --> 24:56.702
l saved it from the washing machine.
l made it just in time.

24:56.870 --> 24:59.580
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

25:20.310 --> 25:23.854
Being part of a couple is as nice
as being alone.

25:24.022 --> 25:26.190
We need to be brave.

25:27.234 --> 25:30.486
They are the words of a song
that a friend made me listen to.

25:30.654 --> 25:33.864
She's the one in the photo.
Her name is Angaharad.

25:36.368 --> 25:41.163
Edo, you're the only one
who loves me how I am.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.626
I have been with a girl.

25:51.758 --> 25:55.886
Gregorio keeps on phoning.
He pretends not to understand.

25:56.054 --> 25:57.763
Maybe he doesn't understand.

26:01.768 --> 26:06.272
I don't know if I'll see her again,
it was very beautifuI.

26:07.649 --> 26:10.985
But I'm in love with another girl.
I love Angaharad.

26:14.864 --> 26:18.284
I don't know what she thinks of me,
or if she Iikes girIs.

26:18.451 --> 26:22.079
Does it matter?
Today I managed to make her laugh.

27:00.744 --> 27:02.202
Antonio!

27:05.290 --> 27:06.832
Antonio?

27:07.834 --> 27:10.419
- Hi, Tom!
- You finally made it!

27:18.511 --> 27:21.055
You told me
there were spectacular views,

27:22.724 --> 27:24.725
but l can't see anything!

27:48.792 --> 27:52.795
You're right, it's lovely here.

27:53.922 --> 27:56.965
- lsn't it a bit too remote?
- Two hours by car.

27:58.009 --> 27:59.593
You're right.

28:04.557 --> 28:06.725
l'm having a party at my house,

28:06.893 --> 28:08.769
for Eva's birthday.

28:08.937 --> 28:11.188
l want to ask her to marry me.

28:14.901 --> 28:17.903
Don't you have anything to say?

28:18.071 --> 28:21.532
- Congratulations.
- A little enthusiasm would be good!

28:21.700 --> 28:24.410
Honestly, l'm happy.
Let's drink to it.

28:26.079 --> 28:27.913
Best wishes!

28:34.796 --> 28:36.922
Try this.

28:37.090 --> 28:39.717
lt's eggplant and elderflower,

28:39.884 --> 28:42.428
l extracted the essence from here.

28:42.595 --> 28:45.556
lf l did this at the restaurant,
my father'd be mad.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.100
He doesn't understand what l do.

28:48.268 --> 28:51.186
He just thinks of the money.

28:54.566 --> 28:57.067
lmagine a restaurant here.

28:57.235 --> 28:59.820
People would have to climb up
to try my dishes.

28:59.988 --> 29:02.781
The essence of flavors.
As simple as this place.

29:02.949 --> 29:04.074
Do it.

29:04.242 --> 29:07.786
- This is all his, he'd never let me.
- Have you asked him?

29:08.913 --> 29:12.332
He thinks it's madness,
biting off more than l can chew.

29:12.500 --> 29:14.418
He says nobody would come.

29:14.586 --> 29:18.589
- l'll convince him.
- lt's not that easy.

29:20.175 --> 29:24.178
Come on, give me a hand.
You've become a real wimp.

29:24.345 --> 29:26.930
Did you invite me here to work?

29:41.446 --> 29:44.656
- Oh, how are you today?
- Doing well, thank you!

29:58.379 --> 30:00.798
- Good morning! How are you?
- Fine, Rachele.

30:00.965 --> 30:05.677
- l'm so glad you've stayed with us.
- Me too, Madam.

30:05.845 --> 30:09.306
She is in a terrible mood,
despite having won the lottery.

30:09.474 --> 30:12.351
Four straight numbers...
l should've listened to her!

30:12.519 --> 30:15.103
- You too?
- l keep her company.

30:16.731 --> 30:20.108
As if coming to my husband's funeral
wasn't enough for her.

30:20.276 --> 30:23.737
She wrote that she shares my sorrow
over Edoardo's death.

30:23.905 --> 30:27.741
Shares what?
My husband was mine alone,

30:27.909 --> 30:30.911
and anything that happened
without me is of no importance!

30:31.079 --> 30:33.831
- Emma!
- Andrea!

30:36.042 --> 30:38.627
She's in a terrible rage!
l have to go.

30:38.795 --> 30:41.922
- Conference call with your husband.
- Goodbye.

30:44.592 --> 30:46.677
Thanks, Emma.

30:46.845 --> 30:49.888
Tancredi called me
from London yesterday.

30:50.056 --> 30:52.724
He is making important decisions.

30:53.810 --> 30:56.645
lt was like listening to his father.

30:56.813 --> 30:59.231
He gets more like him every day.

31:01.192 --> 31:03.151
Elisabetta?

31:03.319 --> 31:07.865
She never calls. What is she up to?

31:08.032 --> 31:10.993
She likes the school she has chosen.

31:12.328 --> 31:14.538
She's very busy studying.

31:14.706 --> 31:19.167
- She wanted to come back today...
- Do you like her?

31:19.335 --> 31:20.544
Sorry?

31:20.712 --> 31:23.505
Edo's girlfriend, the Ugolini girl.

31:23.673 --> 31:26.592
Eva? She's very nice.

31:26.759 --> 31:29.928
He seems happy with her.

31:30.096 --> 31:33.056
l wouldn't be surprised

31:33.224 --> 31:36.143
if they made
an important announcement soon.

31:36.311 --> 31:39.688
The perfect wedding for her
and her family.

31:41.858 --> 31:46.320
Marriage: Number 36 on the Lotto.

31:46.487 --> 31:47.946
That should be lucky!

31:53.369 --> 31:56.580
Let's carry on the family tradition.

31:56.748 --> 31:57.915
Give it to her from me.

31:58.082 --> 31:59.625
Thank you.

32:28.279 --> 32:30.572
lda, it's bustling!

32:30.740 --> 32:34.451
We're almost done, Madam.
The chef's been cooking for two hours.

33:07.902 --> 33:09.111
Mama!

33:10.780 --> 33:12.531
Why are you here?

33:14.117 --> 33:17.327
Remember Antonio?
You met on Grandpa's birthday.

33:18.496 --> 33:20.247
Yes.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.879
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Madam.

33:28.047 --> 33:29.715
Excuse me.

33:31.009 --> 33:34.302
Since l tried his cooking,
l fell in love with him.

33:34.470 --> 33:36.847
Did you prepare all this
on your own?

33:37.015 --> 33:38.807
No, Franco helped me.

33:40.268 --> 33:42.019
Russian salad...

33:44.188 --> 33:47.774
- Why don't you try?
- l don't know how...

33:47.942 --> 33:52.279
- She's a great cook. Go on, Mama!
- Give it a go. lt's not difficult.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.870
- lt looks dangerous.
- lt isn't.

34:01.456 --> 34:03.415
Be brave.

34:05.126 --> 34:06.960
l'll help you.

34:10.422 --> 34:13.800
- Hi, Franco.
- Good evening.

34:25.021 --> 34:27.773
- Perfect, isn't it?
- Perfect!

35:20.076 --> 35:24.412
Mama...

35:24.580 --> 35:26.581
Were you sleeping?

35:31.712 --> 35:33.463
Good idea.

35:33.631 --> 35:35.549
You won't get any peace tonight.

35:43.307 --> 35:45.851
Do you miss Russia?

35:46.018 --> 35:47.602
Sometimes.

35:54.277 --> 35:56.653
You know...

35:56.821 --> 35:59.531
great things are happening there.

35:59.699 --> 36:01.825
Sweetheart...

36:01.993 --> 36:04.035
Bye.

37:22.698 --> 37:25.992
- How is the party going?
- Very well, Madam.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.124
Are you tired, lda?

37:34.377 --> 37:38.463
No, we've had tougher ones.
Anyway, Edo is so happy.

37:39.590 --> 37:43.677
Please sit with me.
Tell me what's going on.

37:43.844 --> 37:45.971
Edo has spent all evening with Eva.

37:46.138 --> 37:48.598
He left her only to try and take

37:48.766 --> 37:51.184
his chef friend away from the kitchen.

37:51.352 --> 37:53.228
He thinks very highly of him.

37:53.396 --> 37:56.189
Luckily, Mr. Tancredi is in London.

37:56.357 --> 38:00.277
He doesn't really like evenings
like these.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.594
- Shall l close the curtains?
- Yes, thanks.

38:40.693 --> 38:43.611
Did you see the wonderful dish
your son's friend sent you?

38:54.540 --> 38:57.375
The party cost more than we'd agreed.

38:57.543 --> 39:00.420
lt was a lovely evening.

39:00.588 --> 39:02.547
Edo was so happy.

39:02.715 --> 39:04.841
A shame you weren't there.

39:05.009 --> 39:07.469
Do you think he wants to marry her?

39:07.636 --> 39:11.473
Your mother is convinced.

39:11.640 --> 39:13.516
Elisabetta thinks so too.

39:15.102 --> 39:17.103
How is Betta?

39:17.271 --> 39:20.106
l thought she looked well;
maybe a bit sad.

39:20.274 --> 39:22.525
l think she wants to get back
with Gregorio.

39:22.693 --> 39:25.695
She told me
you're picking her up tomorrow.

39:25.863 --> 39:28.406
Yes, after lunch with Rori.

39:28.574 --> 39:32.702
l have to admit l was wrong. Going to
London was the right thing for her.

39:32.870 --> 39:36.414
She likes it there.
She seems more motivated.

39:38.250 --> 39:41.878
l don't think she will go back
to Gregorio.

39:42.046 --> 39:44.381
She doesn't love him.

39:44.548 --> 39:45.840
lda?

39:48.010 --> 39:49.928
Here.

39:51.764 --> 39:53.807
What does that mean?

39:58.687 --> 40:01.189
What does Edo think of selling?

40:01.357 --> 40:04.025
He is slowly coming to terms with it.

40:04.193 --> 40:06.945
He can't remain anchored to the past.

40:07.113 --> 40:10.740
Gianluca thinks that selling
is the only sensible option.

40:10.908 --> 40:14.244
And what do you think
about his restaurant idea?

40:14.412 --> 40:15.787
lt's his money!

40:19.333 --> 40:22.794
You know what l think
about my father's decision?

40:22.962 --> 40:25.338
Edo isn't at all ready

40:25.506 --> 40:28.091
to make decisions
about the company.

40:28.259 --> 40:31.469
He still needs a lot of guidance.

40:41.272 --> 40:44.732
Edoardo's mother has confirmed
three people for one o'clock.

40:44.900 --> 40:46.609
Yes, l know.

40:46.777 --> 40:48.736
- What's she like?
- Who?

40:48.904 --> 40:51.573
Mrs. Recchi.
ls she a nice person?

40:52.908 --> 40:54.617
She's nice.

40:57.621 --> 40:59.414
Can l have the press?

41:01.917 --> 41:03.042
Thanks.

41:16.640 --> 41:19.350
What are you charging Edo
for the party?

41:19.518 --> 41:21.936
lt was my gift to him.

41:28.444 --> 41:32.530
Leghorn-style cod.
This goes onto the menu.

41:32.698 --> 41:34.532
We did it!

41:42.791 --> 41:47.462
1995 Bergheim Riesling Altenberg.

41:47.630 --> 41:49.214
Excellent.

41:50.382 --> 41:53.968
The first time my son mentioned Emma

41:54.136 --> 41:56.930
was when we were at La Scala,
on St. Ambrose's feast day.

41:57.097 --> 41:59.265
You were still in Russia.

41:59.433 --> 42:04.020
Tancredi said, "Mama, l'm marrying
a woman more beautiful than you."

42:04.188 --> 42:06.481
Naturally, l didn't believe him.

42:10.528 --> 42:12.612
To the Recchi wives!

42:18.994 --> 42:21.538
Coming here today was a great idea.

42:21.705 --> 42:24.791
Edo is right to believe
in his friend.

42:24.959 --> 42:26.584
He's a real talent.

42:26.752 --> 42:28.503
l'm worried they're pushing it a bit.

42:30.464 --> 42:33.841
The idea of the restaurant
was rather rushed.

42:34.009 --> 42:38.471
Too much enthusiasm
can cause one not to think straight.

42:38.639 --> 42:41.599
Edoardo is an intelligent man.

42:41.767 --> 42:43.601
He knows what he's doing.

42:44.895 --> 42:48.898
Marinated egg yolk, pea cream
and zucchini flowers;

42:49.066 --> 42:53.736
prawns with ratatouille
and sweet-and-sour sauce;

42:53.904 --> 42:56.155
and mixed fish
with crunchy vegetables.

42:56.323 --> 42:58.241
Enjoy your meal.

43:02.496 --> 43:04.914
Where would you like to live?

43:05.082 --> 43:07.500
l wouldn't mind London.

43:07.668 --> 43:11.170
l know a law firm
where l could be an apprentice.

43:11.338 --> 43:13.339
l love the city...

44:02.056 --> 44:04.057
Welcome, ladies.

44:04.224 --> 44:07.727
Antonio, this is Edo's grandmother.
You already know Emma.

44:07.895 --> 44:11.022
- How do you do?
- An excellent meal.

44:11.190 --> 44:14.108
l heard of your project
with my grandson.

44:14.276 --> 44:17.945
l'd be happy to give my opinion
regarding the furnishing.

44:18.113 --> 44:21.032
Thank you.
And thanks for coming.

44:27.539 --> 44:30.249
They seemed happy.

44:30.417 --> 44:32.794
l think so.

44:32.961 --> 44:35.213
l made prawns for your mother.

44:39.885 --> 44:42.887
l know my father
only listens to you,

44:43.055 --> 44:44.972
but l'll try and tell him.

44:50.104 --> 44:52.188
Rori, excuse me a moment.

44:58.862 --> 45:01.280
Am l interrupting?

45:01.448 --> 45:05.284
- l'd like to thank you. You are great.
- Thanks.

45:05.452 --> 45:08.371
The risotto, the prawns,
the vegetables...

45:08.539 --> 45:10.123
they were exquisite.

45:10.290 --> 45:13.084
- l grow the vegetables myself.
- Really? Where?

45:13.252 --> 45:15.712
Near Sanremo, in the countryside,

45:15.879 --> 45:18.715
where your son and l plan
to set up our restaurant.

45:18.882 --> 45:21.676
How will you manage not being here?

45:21.844 --> 45:25.972
Hey, Franco, let me do that.

45:26.140 --> 45:27.306
Good evening, Madam.

45:27.474 --> 45:29.350
l'll go on Thursdays
when we are closed here,

45:29.518 --> 45:32.145
and between shifts whenever l can.

45:33.939 --> 45:37.066
- See you soon.
- With pleasure.

45:37.234 --> 45:38.693
Here l am!

46:50.516 --> 46:52.934
Mama! Grandma!

46:54.478 --> 46:56.604
How wonderful to see you.

47:01.860 --> 47:04.320
- How was the trip?
- Fine.

47:07.741 --> 47:09.951
- How are you?
- Very well.

47:12.204 --> 47:14.163
Betta!

47:22.214 --> 47:25.007
Why did you come?

47:25.175 --> 47:28.261
What do you mean, why?
What have you done?

47:28.428 --> 47:30.638
- Goodbye.
- What?

47:30.806 --> 47:32.390
Shall we go?

48:04.756 --> 48:08.384
l'm sorry l missed Eva's party.

48:08.552 --> 48:12.972
Edo's crazy about Antonio, right?
They want to open a restaurant.

48:13.140 --> 48:15.766
He wants me to stop off
on my way to Nice.

48:15.934 --> 48:18.102
- For your exhibition?
- Yes.

48:22.566 --> 48:25.735
- Can l tell you something?
- Of course.

48:35.704 --> 48:38.205
l left Gregorio for her.

48:39.416 --> 48:41.959
lt's not a passing thing, l'm sure.

48:47.507 --> 48:49.383
Do you like her?

48:49.551 --> 48:52.136
She's beautiful.

48:52.304 --> 48:54.055
Very beautiful.

48:55.182 --> 48:58.059
l don't want to tell dad,
or Gianluca.

48:58.226 --> 49:00.102
They wouldn't understand.

49:03.941 --> 49:07.109
Here, she looks amazing.

49:07.277 --> 49:08.694
Why don't you come to Nice with me?

49:13.992 --> 49:17.995
- l might.
- We can be together.

49:46.817 --> 49:49.777
Can I offer you something to drink?

49:49.945 --> 49:52.029
Why don't you come with me?

49:52.197 --> 49:54.865
We can look for a space
for my exhibition.

49:55.033 --> 49:58.828
We'll leave on Tuesday,
Sanremo to Nice.

49:58.996 --> 50:01.080
What will you do
when we're all in London?

50:01.248 --> 50:05.418
I grow the vegetables myself,
near Sanremo.

50:05.585 --> 50:07.962
Her name's Angaharad,
she's my teacher.

50:08.130 --> 50:11.340
Edo can't stay anchored
to the past, things change.

50:42.539 --> 50:44.540
Edo, darling...

50:44.708 --> 50:46.417
l'm out of town.

50:46.585 --> 50:49.211
l've decided
to go to see Betta in Nice.

50:51.214 --> 50:52.465
But don't tell her.

50:56.178 --> 50:57.970
l'll call you later.

53:14.232 --> 53:16.942
- l'll be right with you, Madam.
- Thank you.

54:00.737 --> 54:03.155
Mrs. Recchi!

54:03.323 --> 54:05.157
How come you're here?

54:05.325 --> 54:08.535
l'm going to visit Betta.

54:08.703 --> 54:10.454
Oh, the exhibition in Nice.
Edo told me about it.

54:12.332 --> 54:15.584
- How about you?
- The restaurant is closed today.

54:15.752 --> 54:17.795
Right, it's Thursday...

54:17.963 --> 54:19.880
the countryside... the vegetables.

54:20.882 --> 54:23.676
lf you aren't too busy,
why don't you come with me?

54:24.928 --> 54:27.179
lt's just a slight detour.

54:27.347 --> 54:29.974
l'll show you where Edo and l
will open the restaurant.

54:30.141 --> 54:31.892
He's already been there a few times.

54:32.936 --> 54:34.603
Okay.

54:35.605 --> 54:37.439
My truck's there.

55:13.768 --> 55:17.313
- Were you born here?
- No, my father's from here.

55:18.773 --> 55:23.110
The land is my grandfather's.
l started cooking here as a child.

55:24.529 --> 55:26.196
l love cooking,

55:26.364 --> 55:28.741
but l'm not as good as you.

55:28.908 --> 55:31.994
Edo tells me the opposite.
He always talks about you.

55:32.162 --> 55:33.579
And he talks to me about you.

55:34.956 --> 55:39.126
He'll be happy you came.

56:48.780 --> 56:52.032
Take a little walk around.
l'll be back in a bit.

59:51.713 --> 59:54.881
Something smells good, lda.

59:55.049 --> 59:57.759
l made spelt soup.

01:00:14.527 --> 01:00:17.321
Why don't you dine
with me this evening?

01:00:17.488 --> 01:00:20.407
lt's strange being in an empty house.

01:00:21.743 --> 01:00:24.411
Thank you, Madam,

01:00:24.579 --> 01:00:27.372
but you know l have my ways.

01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:29.625
- They could change.
- No...

01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:38.508
- Your son called.
- What did he say?

01:00:38.676 --> 01:00:42.179
He asked if you'll pass by the factory
to say goodbye, before he leaves.

01:01:33.272 --> 01:01:35.565
Bye, see you in half an hour.

01:01:36.818 --> 01:01:38.694
How are you, Eva?

01:01:54.252 --> 01:01:56.169
We fired too many workers.

01:01:56.337 --> 01:01:59.423
We had responsibilities towards them.

01:01:59.590 --> 01:02:01.049
Think of their families.

01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:03.510
Grandpa wouldn't have done this.

01:02:03.678 --> 01:02:07.514
Yes, he would. He always did
what was best for the company.

01:02:07.682 --> 01:02:08.849
That's not true.

01:02:09.976 --> 01:02:13.061
Respect for the name, traditions
and values is what matters.

01:02:15.773 --> 01:02:18.275
There.

01:02:18.443 --> 01:02:22.404
Don't be a hypocrite.
You know it's not like that.

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:25.282
Grandpa had no qualms
about dealing with the regime,

01:02:25.450 --> 01:02:28.076
acting as if nothing was going on

01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:31.747
while he exploited Jewish workers.

01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:33.248
That's what we are.

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.792
That's what we Recchis are.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.420
We'll talk about this again in London.

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:41.757
Too many things are heading
in the wrong direction.

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:46.928
l'm always so happy to come here.

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:49.931
l came here with Grandpa as a kid.

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:54.644
He brought me here into the canteen
and sat amongst the workers.

01:02:54.812 --> 01:02:57.272
He enjoyed making them believe
he was one of them.

01:03:00.234 --> 01:03:03.653
Time moves on.
Things change.

01:03:28.387 --> 01:03:30.138
Mama, at last!

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:33.975
We've finished. Everything
is being sent to London today.

01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:35.894
Are you coming to say goodbye?

01:03:36.062 --> 01:03:38.355
Pity...

01:03:38.523 --> 01:03:41.107
Never mind, it's nothing.
How are you, though?

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:54.598
Antonio!

01:05:10.031 --> 01:05:12.157
l wanted you to have it
before l leave.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:17.954
Your father has signed.

01:05:18.122 --> 01:05:22.542
He's granted us half of the land
and permission to open the restaurant.

01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:27.797
You don't seem very happy.

01:05:36.557 --> 01:05:40.352
Tell you what, l'll look at the papers

01:05:40.519 --> 01:05:41.561
and we'll talk when you get back.

01:05:43.689 --> 01:05:45.690
lf you aren't sure, just tell me.

01:05:45.858 --> 01:05:47.859
Sorry.

01:05:48.027 --> 01:05:50.987
You know how l am,
certain things embarrass me.

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:09.589
We're hosting a big dinner.
My father wants you to handle it.

01:06:09.757 --> 01:06:12.133
lt's an important business dinner.

01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:15.136
My mother will call you
with the details.

01:06:16.472 --> 01:06:18.556
Once you've read it, call me.

01:07:07.148 --> 01:07:09.607
Do you like this CD?

01:08:22.139 --> 01:08:23.807
How are you?

01:08:23.974 --> 01:08:26.684
Good morning. A Chinotto please.

01:08:26.852 --> 01:08:28.353
Thanks.

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:35.652
So, for the dinner...

01:08:37.654 --> 01:08:39.948
What do you suggest?

01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:42.575
Ligurian dishes?

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:50.707
You left this in the truck.

01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:34.247
Once, Edo told me about a dish
you make for him.

01:11:34.415 --> 01:11:36.916
He said it's difficult to make.

01:11:37.084 --> 01:11:38.876
Ukha.

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:46.759
You need someone to catch

01:11:46.927 --> 01:11:51.431
a great deal of fish from a river...

01:11:53.017 --> 01:11:55.018
lots of different kinds.

01:11:58.731 --> 01:12:01.149
The most important thing is...

01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:08.031
that the broth must be clear.

01:12:09.783 --> 01:12:12.493
You must be able to see through it.

01:12:25.632 --> 01:12:30.261
When l moved to Milan,
l stopped being Russian.

01:12:30.429 --> 01:12:32.889
There was too much of everything,

01:12:33.057 --> 01:12:35.516
in the streets, in the shops...

01:12:35.684 --> 01:12:39.562
l learned to be ltalian.

01:12:41.148 --> 01:12:45.777
Tancredi collected art. He came
to Russia in search of treasure.

01:12:46.862 --> 01:12:49.906
My father was a restorer.

01:12:50.074 --> 01:12:52.617
Tancredi used to come to our house.

01:12:52.785 --> 01:12:55.912
One day he asked me out.

01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:00.041
He was shy and sweet.

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:02.043
We couldn't be seen in public,

01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:04.754
so we rode in a cab until dawn

01:13:04.922 --> 01:13:07.382
and then made love.

01:13:07.549 --> 01:13:10.093
He brought me to Milan

01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:13.471
and l haven't been back to Russia since.

01:13:15.682 --> 01:13:18.393
lf l got homesick, l cooked.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:23.064
One day l made a soup
that my grandmother taught me.

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:25.650
Ukha.

01:13:25.818 --> 01:13:29.487
Edo, who was six then,
liked it so much

01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:32.323
he kept asking me to make more.

01:13:33.575 --> 01:13:36.661
Edo loves my being Russian.

01:13:40.582 --> 01:13:44.836
Emma...

01:13:45.003 --> 01:13:49.132
Emma is not my real name.

01:13:49.299 --> 01:13:51.926
Tancredi gave it to me.

01:13:53.595 --> 01:13:55.972
What is your real name?

01:13:57.224 --> 01:13:59.267
l no longer know it.

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:07.358
At home...

01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:09.694
they all called me Kitesh.

01:14:12.865 --> 01:14:14.657
Say it.

01:18:58.567 --> 01:19:00.109
Sell.

01:19:42.819 --> 01:19:47.239
Your grandfather was a great man,
but we have to look to the future.

01:20:13.141 --> 01:20:15.267
Papa!

01:20:15.435 --> 01:20:16.977
What, Edo?

01:21:26.756 --> 01:21:29.133
Gianluca took me to the Atlantique.

01:21:29.301 --> 01:21:33.137
l thought l'd get him back by
taking him to an Electrelane concert.

01:21:34.222 --> 01:21:36.056
But he loved it!

01:21:36.224 --> 01:21:40.185
Being among a crowd
of ecstatic lesbians!

01:21:48.904 --> 01:21:51.655
Betta, it's done. We're selling.

01:21:51.823 --> 01:21:54.909
We'll be even richer.

01:22:07.130 --> 01:22:08.464
Come here.

01:22:18.725 --> 01:22:21.477
Thanks, if it weren't for you...

01:22:21.645 --> 01:22:24.939
You mustn't thank me.
l did it out of selfishness.

01:22:27.067 --> 01:22:29.610
l'm happy knowing you're happy.

01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:36.825
Happy? "Happy" is a word
that makes one sad.

01:22:44.501 --> 01:22:46.961
Why aren't you happy?

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:14.863
Edo, what's wrong?

01:23:25.959 --> 01:23:28.419
- Can you give this to Mama?
- Yes, sure.

01:26:12.667 --> 01:26:15.377
You look nice with short hair.

01:26:20.967 --> 01:26:23.760
Did you speak to Edoardo?

01:26:23.928 --> 01:26:28.056
When we got back,
l found him relieved.

01:26:28.224 --> 01:26:30.184
lt's important for us all
to stick together.

01:26:33.688 --> 01:26:36.982
- Sorry, were you watching it?
- No, don't worry.

01:26:37.150 --> 01:26:38.942
l'm tired.

01:27:14.812 --> 01:27:16.605
- Liliana!
- Yes?

01:27:16.773 --> 01:27:19.399
They're here. Go and help them.

01:27:22.403 --> 01:27:24.821
Good morning, Madam.
Can l help you?

01:27:24.989 --> 01:27:26.031
Thank you.

01:27:36.167 --> 01:27:38.460
You disappeared without telling me.

01:28:10.493 --> 01:28:12.286
Good evening.

01:28:35.476 --> 01:28:38.687
Mama, let me introduce you
to Shai Kubelkian.

01:28:39.814 --> 01:28:42.691
Good evening, l'm Rori.

01:28:42.859 --> 01:28:45.068
- Beatrice Tavecchia.
- Good evening.

01:28:59.208 --> 01:29:01.335
- Sorry?
- Tancredi told him you're Russian.

01:29:13.431 --> 01:29:14.598
Thanks.

01:29:28.571 --> 01:29:30.447
Can l talk to you?

01:29:36.287 --> 01:29:40.040
- l want to see you happy.
- l am happy.

01:29:40.208 --> 01:29:43.377
Thanks to you, to Antonio,
to my mother,

01:29:43.544 --> 01:29:46.421
and to him, or her.

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:51.635
Excuse me.

01:29:51.803 --> 01:29:53.595
Mama!

01:30:52.864 --> 01:30:55.699
Does Edo know
you prepared his soup?

01:30:55.867 --> 01:30:57.492
No, he doesn't.

01:30:57.660 --> 01:30:59.244
He'll be pleased.

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:01.765
- You have wonderful children.
- Thanks.

01:33:09.667 --> 01:33:11.293
Darling...

01:33:12.503 --> 01:33:13.753
Thank you, Mama.

01:33:15.256 --> 01:33:17.299
l'll go, you stay here.

01:33:22.054 --> 01:33:26.182
Please forgive us. You've now seen
an example of Russian temper.

01:33:27.810 --> 01:33:29.477
Edo and his mother...

01:33:46.245 --> 01:33:48.079
Wait!

01:33:50.374 --> 01:33:52.208
Wait for me!

01:33:55.254 --> 01:33:57.088
Listen to me!

01:34:00.676 --> 01:34:02.719
Let's talk.

01:34:08.643 --> 01:34:11.227
l beg you, look at me and listen!

01:34:14.732 --> 01:34:17.525
- You're lying.
- What?

01:34:17.693 --> 01:34:20.111
- You're just like the others.
- What do you mean?

01:34:20.279 --> 01:34:22.614
You're just like Gianluca,
Papa, Antonio.

01:34:22.782 --> 01:34:26.284
You even gave him our ukha.

01:34:26.452 --> 01:34:29.621
l wanted to tell you something
important, but no...

01:34:29.789 --> 01:34:32.624
l don't want anything to do with you,
you're nothing to me.

01:34:32.792 --> 01:34:37.128
Trust me, Edo!

01:34:37.296 --> 01:34:38.338
Don't touch me!

01:35:54.331 --> 01:35:55.915
Good evening.

01:36:05.593 --> 01:36:07.385
l don't have good news...

01:36:08.596 --> 01:36:12.056
Your son suffered a head injury

01:36:12.224 --> 01:36:15.477
which caused a hematoma
that pressed against his brain.

01:36:15.644 --> 01:36:18.897
So we removed it.

01:36:19.064 --> 01:36:24.152
But the fall also caused
a more serious hemorrhage.

01:36:29.366 --> 01:36:31.868
He never regained consciousness.

01:36:32.036 --> 01:36:34.788
l don't think he suffered.

01:36:36.832 --> 01:36:39.000
l'm sorry.

01:36:39.168 --> 01:36:41.377
l'll take you to him.

01:40:58.552 --> 01:41:00.470
Kitesh...

01:41:03.348 --> 01:41:04.849
Emma!

01:41:32.169 --> 01:41:34.003
Madam.

01:41:40.928 --> 01:41:43.012
You have to wake up.

01:42:54.501 --> 01:42:56.377
Our Lord Jesus Christ,

01:42:56.545 --> 01:42:59.255
who after resting three days
in the sepulcher

01:42:59.423 --> 01:43:03.134
gave assurance of resurrection

01:43:03.302 --> 01:43:06.554
to those who believe in You,

01:43:06.722 --> 01:43:11.017
let our brother Edoardo
rest in peace

01:43:11.185 --> 01:43:15.938
until the day You,
the Resurrection and the Life,

01:43:16.106 --> 01:43:19.775
will illuminate him
with the splendor of Your vision

01:43:19.943 --> 01:43:23.821
so that he may see the glory
of Your Kingdom,

01:43:23.989 --> 01:43:27.241
You who live and reign eternally.

01:43:27.409 --> 01:43:29.493
Amen.

01:43:31.330 --> 01:43:32.788
Give him everlasting rest

01:43:32.956 --> 01:43:34.540
and eternal peace

01:43:34.708 --> 01:43:38.669
in the glory of Your light. Amen.

01:47:50.755 --> 01:47:53.883
Emma...

01:48:16.531 --> 01:48:21.202
You no longer know who l am.

01:48:32.839 --> 01:48:36.175
Darling, please.

01:48:36.343 --> 01:48:39.220
We mustn't go out of our minds.

01:48:40.639 --> 01:48:43.057
We have to carry on.

01:48:46.478 --> 01:48:48.896
Together.

01:49:37.779 --> 01:49:40.614
l love Antonio.

01:50:17.277 --> 01:50:20.237
You don't exist.

01:51:25.845 --> 01:51:34.770
Madam!

01:53:52.659 --> 01:53:56.119
Gianluca?

01:53:56.287 --> 01:53:57.913
Rori?

01:54:16.391 --> 01:54:18.350
Betta?

01:54:27.610 --> 01:54:29.236
Mama?
