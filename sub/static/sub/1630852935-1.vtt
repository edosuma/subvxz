WEBVTT

00:35.326 --> 00:36.494
Wait, what?

00:55.430 --> 00:57.891
The... Proud... Family... What?

00:58.058 --> 01:00.018
You and me will always be tight

01:00.143 --> 01:02.479
Family every day and every night

01:02.562 --> 01:04.731
Even when you start acting like a fool

01:04.814 --> 01:07.275
You know that I'm lovin'
every single thing you do

01:07.400 --> 01:09.694
I know I can always be myself

01:10.111 --> 01:12.322
When I'm with you
more than anybody else

01:12.405 --> 01:14.657
Every single day
that I'm headed off to school

01:14.741 --> 01:17.285
You know there's no one
I love as much as you

01:17.368 --> 01:20.205
The family the family

01:20.288 --> 01:22.123
Proud family

01:22.457 --> 01:25.335
They'll make you scream!

01:25.418 --> 01:27.087
They'll make you wanna sing!

01:27.170 --> 01:30.590
It's a family thing, a family
a proud, proud family

01:30.673 --> 01:32.217
Proud family

01:32.300 --> 01:35.178
They'll push your buttons!

01:35.261 --> 01:37.097
They'll make you wanna hug them

01:37.180 --> 01:40.183
A family, family
proud, proud family

01:40.266 --> 01:41.434
Proud, proud family

01:43.770 --> 01:46.272
Wobble, baby, wobble, baby
Wobble, baby, wobble

01:46.356 --> 01:50.568
Ooh. Vote for Wizard Kelly for mayor,
and everybody gets a stimulus check.

01:50.652 --> 01:53.029
You'll be wobblin' all the way
to the bank, y'all.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.447
- Wobble, baby.
- I hate that idiot!

01:54.531 --> 01:56.658
You better not vote for him, Mr. Chips.

01:57.033 --> 01:59.369
And stop wobblin', Mr. Chips!
And get that grinder!

02:07.627 --> 02:08.795
My newest creation...

02:09.170 --> 02:10.880
Proud's Diet Gummie Yummies!

02:10.964 --> 02:13.049
They stick to your teeth
and not to your tummy!

02:13.133 --> 02:15.426
I'm finally gonna be richer
than the Wizard!

02:15.510 --> 02:18.012
- Of course you're gonna get a raise.

02:18.096 --> 02:20.306
Stupid organ grinder,
you'll be the first one I fire.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.808
Chips, bring in the monkeys!

02:24.936 --> 02:27.147
Quiet, you chimps!
Get my slingshot, Mr. Chips.

02:27.564 --> 02:30.775
Oh, so you're one of them now?
Well, you can forget about that raise.

02:32.318 --> 02:36.030
Trudy! Trudy! Trudy!

02:36.531 --> 02:39.492
Trudy! Trudy! Where's my slingshot?

02:39.617 --> 02:41.369
Oscar, did you look under the sink?

02:41.452 --> 02:44.122
Of course I looked, woman!
You're always movin' stuff!

02:47.041 --> 02:48.042
Never mind.

02:51.421 --> 02:55.508
That looks amazing. Thank you, Bobby.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.887
I still think you'd make more money
if you did a nacho truck.

02:58.970 --> 03:05.059
I love nachos... and yeah

03:07.187 --> 03:09.189
I made some modifications, Trudy.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.482
Just hit the button, child.

03:21.075 --> 03:22.493
Ow!

03:22.577 --> 03:23.703
Whoa!

03:27.248 --> 03:29.751
Would you stand still
and open your mouth, Chunky Monkey?

03:36.299 --> 03:38.301
And you can forget that Christmas bonus!

03:41.554 --> 03:43.640
BeBe! CeCe! No!

03:47.352 --> 03:48.645
It worked?

03:50.480 --> 03:53.483
It worked! Mr. Chips, delete your new map!

03:53.608 --> 03:54.859
We're about to blow up!

03:56.319 --> 03:59.155
Whoa! Funk-funk! Trudy!

03:59.656 --> 04:01.115
What now, Oscar?

04:01.199 --> 04:02.825
Come change your evil children.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.535
Look, Oscar, we agreed.

04:04.619 --> 04:06.412
Now that I'm expanding my business,

04:06.496 --> 04:08.498
you will start pulling
your weight around here.

04:08.581 --> 04:11.000
- I pull my weight. I bought this house.
- No, you didn't.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.085
- I bought the cars.
- Nope.

04:12.168 --> 04:13.169
- Groceries?
- Mm-mmm.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.004
- So, what are you tryin' to say?
- I'm saying,

04:15.088 --> 04:18.967
the one who makes spare change
should change BeBe and CeCe.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.969
And anything else I tell them to do.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.637
Okay. Fine!

04:22.720 --> 04:23.846
Penny!

04:23.930 --> 04:25.974
- Morning, family.

04:26.182 --> 04:28.226
Good googly goose fat!

04:28.685 --> 04:31.479
And that's just
What I do, do, do

04:31.604 --> 04:34.399
And that's just how we do it, do it, do it

04:34.482 --> 04:36.526
Yeah, that's how we do it, do it

04:39.112 --> 04:41.531
- Penny, where'd you get these from?
- They Mama's.

04:41.614 --> 04:45.285
Ah, your mother. Trudith, my dear,
may I have a word with you, please?

04:45.785 --> 04:48.955
Chloe! I mean... Halle!
I mean Penny is wearing...

04:49.372 --> 04:51.708
- What are these?
- Oscar, relax.

04:52.041 --> 04:54.544
Our little girl is becoming a young lady,

04:54.627 --> 04:57.422
and there is nothing you can do about it.

04:57.505 --> 04:59.007
Au contraire, mon cheri...

05:06.431 --> 05:08.016
Mama, make Oscar stop!

05:08.099 --> 05:11.185
If you're so worried about Penny,
why don't you just talk to her?

05:11.269 --> 05:14.272
I'm still waitin' for Suga Mama
to talk to me. You talk to her.

05:16.024 --> 05:18.651
Boy, that was the best vacation
I've ever had.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.528
Thank goodness for you, Papi.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.244
Ooh.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.080
I just love the way that man talks!

05:31.164 --> 05:34.459
Well, I don't "love" the way
you keep spendin' my inheritance

05:34.542 --> 05:36.127
on trips with Pitbull's granddaddy.

05:36.210 --> 05:38.463
Why is my grandbaby
dressed like Darth Vader?

05:38.546 --> 05:41.299
To keep the boys away
like you did during the Crusades!

05:43.259 --> 05:45.136
Ow! You hit me!

05:45.219 --> 05:47.305
- I'm callin' child services.
- You a snitch?

05:51.434 --> 05:54.103
Thank you, Suga Mama.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.689
Oh, no need, baby. I loved it.

05:56.773 --> 05:59.650
Penny! Come out, Penny!

06:00.151 --> 06:01.778
Now, go and enjoy your life.

06:01.861 --> 06:04.864
But not too much, Penny.
Remember how we raised you.

06:04.947 --> 06:08.659
Okay. I will, Mama. I promise.

06:08.951 --> 06:10.536
Gotta go.

06:17.585 --> 06:20.421
Boo, we need to take you shopping
for some new Wiz Mar wedges

06:20.505 --> 06:22.173
because what are those?

06:22.507 --> 06:25.843
Wow! Y'all saw the light, too?

06:26.094 --> 06:29.305
Yeah, girl. I'm snatched!

06:29.430 --> 06:31.265
I wish you would snatch that wig up.

06:31.349 --> 06:34.227
Michael, you look good!

06:34.310 --> 06:37.271
- You've got...
- More style than all of you? I know.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.649
Yeah, the Back-to-School Kickback,

06:39.732 --> 06:42.652
of which yours truly
is the committee chairman,

06:42.735 --> 06:43.903
is this weekend.

06:43.986 --> 06:46.531
And you can't get in lookin'
all crusty and musty.

06:46.697 --> 06:50.952
- Hey, girl.
- Wow! And, Zoey, you're uh...

06:52.453 --> 06:53.538
- taller.
- Yep.

06:53.621 --> 06:55.581
And I'm pretty sure this is it for me.

06:55.706 --> 06:58.292
I shouldn't have gone to bed
with my face mask on.

06:58.668 --> 07:01.838
Hey, LaCienega. We all changed.
What about you?

07:02.880 --> 07:05.633
- LaCienega, did you see the light?

07:09.512 --> 07:13.057
Zang! You got those Ashanti sideburns!

07:13.182 --> 07:15.059
And Freddie Mercury's moustache.

07:18.354 --> 07:20.356
LaCienega, say something.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.774
I don't know what happened.

07:21.858 --> 07:25.153
I got my eight hours of
beauty-sleep like I normally do,

07:25.236 --> 07:28.197
and I woke up like...
well, like you, Proud!

07:28.698 --> 07:31.325
What am I gonna do?

07:31.409 --> 07:33.703
Don't worry, I got you, Chewbacca.

07:33.786 --> 07:37.165
- Chupacabra?
- Nobody's calling you a chupacabra.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.000
I'm talking about fixing your face.

07:39.417 --> 07:42.920
We're gonna pluck, wax, and lase
that nastiness right off of you, baby.

07:43.254 --> 07:45.047
Ooh, let's go get my Sticky.

07:45.131 --> 07:49.385
If he's got half the hair you got,
he's gonna be a zaddy now.

07:53.598 --> 07:56.601
No wonder Sticky rides
that dang hoverboard everywhere.

07:56.684 --> 07:58.269
I can't breathe.

07:58.478 --> 08:02.773
Come on!
We're almost at my man's house.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.611
Forget the zaddy.
I'm calling my daddy.

08:07.278 --> 08:08.279
Uh-oh.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.575
Wow! The Gross Sisters changed, too.

08:12.658 --> 08:14.118
They look meaner.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.871
- And ashier.
- And they can levitate.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.415
Yeah, it's called Black Girl Magic.

08:19.832 --> 08:21.501
Welcome to our hood.

08:21.709 --> 08:25.755
I didn't know y'all lived here.
I guess y'all bad and bougie now, huh?

08:26.964 --> 08:29.383
For sure. We movin' on up, weezy.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.427
Look, Nubia, we don't have anything.

08:31.552 --> 08:33.179
Man, relax, Proud.

08:33.262 --> 08:35.765
We done jackin'. We in the rap game now.

08:35.848 --> 08:37.850
And we got our own record label.

08:37.975 --> 08:39.894
Hands Up, Cash Out Records.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.562

08:43.481 --> 08:45.107
Olei got them fire hooks,

08:45.316 --> 08:46.817

08:47.109 --> 08:48.152
Hands up, yup

08:48.236 --> 08:49.862

08:49.946 --> 08:51.948

08:52.406 --> 08:54.283

08:54.367 --> 08:55.743
Hands up, cash out

09:00.081 --> 09:02.375

09:02.458 --> 09:04.752

09:04.835 --> 09:05.920
Hands up, cash out

09:06.003 --> 09:07.880

09:12.009 --> 09:13.344
Yo, we finished!

09:13.761 --> 09:16.764
- Yes! Everything! Work!
- Good job!

09:16.847 --> 09:19.934
Y'all might wanna reconsider
that bully thing.

09:20.017 --> 09:23.521
Dijonay, shut up!
Thanks for the private concert.

09:23.646 --> 09:24.814
See ya.

09:25.481 --> 09:27.525
No, uh-uh. Hold up, Dijonay.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.902
We heard you was
in charge of bookin' the school dance.

09:30.152 --> 09:33.447
Hey, I think y'all did y'all thing
and all, but...

09:33.739 --> 09:36.200
Man, please! Y'all can't afford us.

09:36.325 --> 09:38.077
I'm talkin' about our new artist.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.245
Young Toddler.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.665
He's, uh, cute?

09:43.040 --> 09:47.253
Good. He booked then.
But I'mma need his money upfront, in cash.

09:48.212 --> 09:49.922
Zang!

09:54.552 --> 09:56.929
Hey, Sticky!

09:57.638 --> 09:59.181
Sticky!

10:00.057 --> 10:01.684
Sheesh!

10:02.018 --> 10:04.186
"Shee" back at ya!

10:04.812 --> 10:08.608
Dang, Sticky, you really changed.

10:08.691 --> 10:11.986
You a man now, baby. A grown man.

10:12.570 --> 10:13.821
Ooh.

10:13.904 --> 10:16.532
Hold up. I'm sorry, Icky,
but I'm not Sticky.

10:17.366 --> 10:18.784
Well, where's my man?

10:18.868 --> 10:20.661
He and his family moved, you noob.

10:20.745 --> 10:23.205
- They did? When?

10:26.959 --> 10:29.003
He didn't even say goodbye!

10:29.086 --> 10:32.298
He left this envelope for uh...D-J-onays?

10:32.590 --> 10:33.924
That's me!

10:34.008 --> 10:36.010
Ooh, I knew he loved me.

10:36.260 --> 10:37.261
What does it say?

10:38.054 --> 10:39.680
"Give this to Penny."

10:41.265 --> 10:44.185
"Penny, I'm really gonna
miss you guys." Aw.

10:44.268 --> 10:46.187
"My dad got a job in Japan.

10:46.270 --> 10:47.730
"He said I didn't have to go,

10:47.813 --> 10:50.066
"I could stay with my cousins if I wanted,

10:50.149 --> 10:53.027
"but I've just had enough
of that crazy Dijo..."

10:53.235 --> 10:55.821
Oh! Okay. We've got the idea.

10:55.905 --> 10:58.282
I'm gonna find that Dija-whoever-she-is.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.867
She drove my man away!

10:59.950 --> 11:02.370
KG, Dad said finish your breakfast.

11:02.453 --> 11:04.080
We're about to leave for school.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.290
Dad ain't say nothin'.
And you ain't the boss of me.

11:06.374 --> 11:07.750
Put down the game and get inside.

11:07.833 --> 11:10.169
And you put down
your stink attitude. Trippin'.

11:10.252 --> 11:11.796
Hi! I'm Penny.

11:11.962 --> 11:15.091
That's Zoey, Dijonay, LaCienega,
and Michael.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.509
Welcome to the neighborhood.

11:16.842 --> 11:17.968
Hi.

11:20.471 --> 11:21.514
- Bye.
- Ooh!

11:21.597 --> 11:23.140
- I like your hair.
- Uh.

11:23.265 --> 11:25.476
Didn't you hear Solange?
You should know better, sis.

11:25.810 --> 11:28.896
I'm sorry.
Maybe we can hang out after school.

11:28.979 --> 11:31.816
I could give you the tea
on what's up around here.

11:31.899 --> 11:33.025
Penny, is it?

11:33.150 --> 11:34.527
Yeah, I don't drink tea.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.654
Ooh!

11:36.737 --> 11:38.030
Did she just throw shade?

11:39.657 --> 11:41.075
She sure did, Omarosa.

11:42.910 --> 11:45.538
All right, My-My, time to go.

11:45.746 --> 11:47.498
Oh! Hello.

11:47.581 --> 11:49.750
My-My, you wanna introduce me
to your new friends?

11:50.042 --> 11:51.043
No.

11:52.962 --> 11:55.381
I'm Bear-Bear... I'm Barry.

11:55.464 --> 11:58.217
Sometimes she calls me Bear-Bear,
but yeah.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.552
I'm Maya and KG's father.

11:59.677 --> 12:01.429
- Hello.
- Hello, sir.

12:01.762 --> 12:03.347
Come on, Dad, let's go.

12:03.597 --> 12:04.932
Nice meeting everyone.

12:05.182 --> 12:08.102
- Okay, Maya, see you at school.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.398
Wow. She really don't like you, boo.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.277
Michael, what are you talkin' about?
Everybody likes me.

12:16.485 --> 12:19.739
Who cares? It's all about that cutie KG.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.949
Did you see the way he was lookin' at me?

12:22.032 --> 12:25.161
He was looking at me, Dijon.
I was standing behind you.

12:25.244 --> 12:27.872
And he looked right through
you two ratchets, to me.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.874
- Are you okay, Penny?
- No.

12:29.999 --> 12:33.210
I wake up in a strange body,
I don't know how to walk anymore,

12:33.294 --> 12:35.004
and suddenly, people don't like me!

12:35.379 --> 12:38.174
Tell me about it, sister.
Welcome to my world.

12:38.466 --> 12:41.051
Well, you know what?
I'm gonna make Maya like me,

12:41.135 --> 12:44.472
because everybody likes me. You'll see!

12:47.183 --> 12:50.311
Hey, Maya girl! I saved you a seat.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.947
What do you know? We're neighbors!

13:02.448 --> 13:05.326
I hope you don't mind,
I painted your locker just to say,

13:05.409 --> 13:07.369
welcome to Willy T!

13:09.580 --> 13:11.457
Hey, Penny!

13:11.540 --> 13:14.293
What do you know?
We're neighbors.

13:14.668 --> 13:16.420
I'm gonna have to buy some bitcoin.

13:16.504 --> 13:19.632
It's going to be a good year. Yeah.

13:22.968 --> 13:27.807
Hey, Maya, what do you say you
and I meet up at Wizbucks after school?

13:27.890 --> 13:30.476
Chocolate lattes on me, y'all!

13:31.685 --> 13:34.063
I guess the answer is no.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.941
Well, Maya and KG,

13:37.024 --> 13:40.110
for your indoctrination tour
here at Willy T. Ribbs,

13:40.528 --> 13:43.531
you will be escorted by one of our finest.

13:43.781 --> 13:44.907
Penny Proud.

13:45.032 --> 13:47.034
Hey, Maya, it's your girl.

13:47.326 --> 13:50.830
Thanks, Ms. Hightower,
but I know where everything is.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.081
Bye.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.791
Why doesn't your sister like me?

13:53.874 --> 13:56.293
It's not even you,
she just hates all humans.

13:56.418 --> 13:58.712
KG! I've been lookin' for you!

13:58.796 --> 14:00.381
Sheesh!

14:03.843 --> 14:04.927
Oh, man.

14:07.012 --> 14:09.181
I should have never taught him
how to text.

14:09.765 --> 14:12.142
- Piece of cake.

14:12.393 --> 14:14.687
Hey, hey, hey. Look at that.

14:15.646 --> 14:18.774
Please don't play with merchandise, Proud.

14:19.191 --> 14:21.694
- Hey, Bufferina, does this thing work?

14:21.777 --> 14:23.487
- Whoa! Penny! Look out!

14:28.117 --> 14:29.702
Uh, I guess it does.

14:33.455 --> 14:35.040
- You got a layaway plan?
- Sure.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.170
Oh! Looks like you broke, Daddy.

14:40.254 --> 14:41.255
- Let's go.
- Nope.

14:41.338 --> 14:43.674
I got your mother's card.
I never leave home without it.

14:43.883 --> 14:47.011
Dang, Daddy! This isn't fair!

14:47.094 --> 14:48.888
I know you don't understand, Penny,

14:48.971 --> 14:51.307
but one day you will
when you have your own children.

14:51.390 --> 14:54.018
And yes, I know that day will come.

14:54.101 --> 14:56.186
And it's my job as your father...

14:57.229 --> 14:59.315
to do everything in my power
to prevent it!

14:59.398 --> 15:00.441
Now, you got a choice.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.860
You can either buy some clothes
from the Army/Navy store

15:02.943 --> 15:04.278
or you can join the Army/Navy!

15:07.573 --> 15:09.992
Psst. Psst-psst.

15:10.075 --> 15:12.202
Penny! In here.

15:14.079 --> 15:15.289
What are you doin' here?

15:15.372 --> 15:17.458
My dad tried to do the same thing to me.

15:18.208 --> 15:21.003
Now, hush.
We've got work to do, Miss Thing.

15:22.671 --> 15:24.465
Penny! What're you doin' in there?

15:24.715 --> 15:26.800
You're just like your mama, come on!

15:27.468 --> 15:29.887
Where did you get those?

15:30.179 --> 15:32.932
- You gave 'em to me, Daddy.
- Oh, forget it. Put these on.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.143
- Take this.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.228
- Get back in there.

15:38.312 --> 15:39.396
What's goin' on here?

15:39.480 --> 15:42.191
- Who is that in there, Vera Wang?

15:44.985 --> 15:46.904
- Michael?
- Hey, Mr. Proud.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.245
Is this dress-up day or what?

15:55.329 --> 15:57.998
No, this is my-daddy-is-afraid
of-me-growin'-up day!

15:58.290 --> 16:02.169
Well, that explains you.
But what about you, Michael?

16:02.378 --> 16:05.965
This is my-dad-got-a-call
from-Penny's-dad day.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.385
What? How did you do that?

16:09.551 --> 16:11.845
I stay ready, I don't get ready.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.973
Here, let me show you, boo.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.599
Michael, you gotta teach me that.

16:16.517 --> 16:17.518
Uh-oh.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.937
Who is that snack?

16:22.439 --> 16:25.150
LaCienega?
You gotta get that taken care of!

16:25.275 --> 16:26.902
You out here catfishin'!

16:26.986 --> 16:28.529
I told her to come and see me.

16:28.612 --> 16:31.156
A little hot wax
and you'll be fabulous again.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.660
Do you even know what you're doing?

16:34.785 --> 16:38.288
You weren't the only one the light played
a trick on, boo. This is me.

16:39.498 --> 16:42.418
Ay mia, que feo! Okay, do it.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.798
Ahhh! My face is on fire!

16:48.007 --> 16:49.591
Not for long, J.Lo.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.972
- Voila!

16:57.099 --> 16:58.308
Ooh.

16:58.392 --> 17:00.227
What's wrong? Did it work?

17:01.812 --> 17:04.648
Oh, hold up. Cutie at nine o' clock.

17:04.732 --> 17:07.401
I'm gonna go get my phone charger,
I'll be right back.

17:07.484 --> 17:09.069
Hey! Where's everybody going?

17:15.701 --> 17:17.703
"Save Shuggie, the giant panda"?

17:17.911 --> 17:20.706
Well, I like pandas. What do I have to do?

17:21.123 --> 17:24.752
I have done everything to be nice to you,
what's your deal?

17:24.835 --> 17:26.837
No deal. I just don't like you.

17:27.254 --> 17:29.923
How? Everybody likes me.

17:30.007 --> 17:33.552
Well, except LaCienega, the Gross Sisters,
my fifth period teacher.

17:33.844 --> 17:35.304
Well, add me to that list.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.264
But why? You don't even know me.

17:37.431 --> 17:40.017
Oh, I know you and your little followers.

17:40.267 --> 17:43.854
Every school I've been to,
there's always a group just like you.

17:43.937 --> 17:47.107
Think they're smarter than everybody,
cuter than everybody,

17:47.191 --> 17:49.151
when in reality, you're just lame.

17:49.359 --> 17:51.570
No one has ever called me "lame."

17:51.653 --> 17:52.821
Inconsequential.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.865
- Or "inconsequential."
- Superficial.

17:54.948 --> 17:58.535
"Superficial?"
I am the deepest person I know.

17:58.619 --> 18:01.205
Then prove it. Here. Meet me at the zoo.

18:01.497 --> 18:04.166
Unless you'll be too busy
with your "squad goals."

18:04.249 --> 18:07.711
Uh-uh. This is the night of the
Back-to-School Kickback. I can't make it.

18:07.795 --> 18:08.921
I thought so.

18:10.798 --> 18:14.718
Penny Proud, I know you're over there!
I can see you...

18:15.052 --> 18:16.345
sort of.

18:17.554 --> 18:19.223
Are you okay, LaCienega?

18:19.348 --> 18:21.433
It's just that I've never been like this.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.852
- Like what?
- Not cute.

18:24.186 --> 18:27.815
I don't know how to deal with it!
How do you do it?

18:31.068 --> 18:34.154
You know what? You can start dealing
with it by not being so...

18:35.823 --> 18:37.533
Oh, zang!

18:38.033 --> 18:41.203
Maya's right. We are superficial.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.415
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.
I'm going to the dance!

18:45.499 --> 18:48.210
Now, hold it right there, young lady.
Let me see what you got on.

18:48.293 --> 18:50.546
Oscar, haven't you embarrassed her enough?

18:50.629 --> 18:54.299
Oh, no, I'm just gettin' started.
Now, get over here, Penny. Let me see you.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.011
Now, that's my baby girl!

18:58.095 --> 19:00.764
You're gonna be the prettiest girl
at the dance. You'll see!

19:00.848 --> 19:03.308
- Semper fi!
- Semper fi!

19:03.392 --> 19:05.769
- See? She's not embarrassed at all.

19:12.651 --> 19:15.320
Huh, ain't nobody
Gonna change me

19:15.404 --> 19:17.698
Huh, got my diaper with a chain piece

19:17.781 --> 19:20.117
Yeah, they be like
"Homie, who raised you?"

19:20.200 --> 19:22.536
What? Man, why they hatin' on a baby?

19:22.619 --> 19:23.620
Look, check

19:23.829 --> 19:26.290
Know that I'm a conqueror
Tell me what's poppin'

19:26.373 --> 19:27.499
They call me Young Toddler

19:27.583 --> 19:28.584
I'm a lil' monster

19:28.667 --> 19:31.253
They took me for granted
so they got me trainin' for the potty

19:31.336 --> 19:33.630
The diaper the only thing
they be changin' to be honest

19:33.714 --> 19:36.091
I'm plottin', they gonna make me king...

19:36.466 --> 19:38.427
Ooh, Young Toddler.

19:38.510 --> 19:39.761
He's good, Nubia.

19:39.928 --> 19:42.639
Oh, I know.
That's why his price just went up.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.766
Oh, glad we got him when he was cheap.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.936
Nah, fool,
his price just went up right now.

19:48.103 --> 19:49.771
Zang!

19:49.980 --> 19:53.692
Psst. Dijonay, if anybody asks, I'm here.

19:54.234 --> 19:57.321
- But you are here.
- I am now, but I won't be.

19:57.487 --> 19:59.990
- Where won't you be?
- Here, at the dance!

20:00.073 --> 20:02.993
- But you are at the dance!
- Girl, just tell 'em I'm here!

20:03.118 --> 20:04.369
Okay!

20:05.412 --> 20:07.581
- Tell who?

20:07.664 --> 20:08.790
- Michael?
- Got it.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.461
LaCienega? You look good.
What did you do, girl?

20:12.544 --> 20:14.963
- Michael.
- I told you I could upgrade you, girl.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.848
Hey, I didn't think you'd show up.

20:25.098 --> 20:27.434
About that, where is everybody?

20:27.601 --> 20:29.561
We are everybody.

20:31.855 --> 20:34.566
- Come on.
- Oh! Isn't the zoo closed?

20:34.650 --> 20:35.984
Yeah, so you don't need a ticket.

20:36.109 --> 20:38.528
Wait, I thought we were protesting
for the panda.

20:38.862 --> 20:40.864
We are. We're breakin' him out.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.658
- Breakin' him out?
- Yes.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.618
Girl, you're trippin'.

20:45.452 --> 20:46.954
Are you comin'?

20:58.340 --> 21:00.842
Okay, this is it.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.388
Ugh. It's locked.

21:04.763 --> 21:07.766
Oh, man!
Well, we did what we could. Let's go.

21:07.849 --> 21:10.769
We can't now, Penny.
No animal should have to live like this.

21:10.852 --> 21:12.854
- What? How did you...
- Are you comin' or not?

21:12.938 --> 21:15.899
Uh, you know they got a sign here
with skull and bones

21:15.983 --> 21:17.985
and somethin' about
"under the penalty of law?"

21:19.069 --> 21:20.237
Zang!

21:20.654 --> 21:23.240
Okay, Penny,
you know you shouldn't do this.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.003
Hello, my love

21:36.086 --> 21:38.547
I heard a kiss from you

21:39.339 --> 21:43.802
Red magic satin playing near, too

21:44.386 --> 21:47.180
A present from you

21:47.597 --> 21:50.058
Strawberry letter 22

21:50.475 --> 21:54.396
The music plays
I sit in for a few

21:57.316 --> 22:01.069
Said ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

22:03.113 --> 22:07.200
Ooh ooh ooh

22:07.868 --> 22:11.705
Said ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

22:21.256 --> 22:24.051
Got to be more careful.
That's bamboo, I hate that.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.635
What you tryin' to do? Kill a brother?

22:25.719 --> 22:26.887
Pandas love bamboo.

22:26.970 --> 22:30.349
Now, see, that's a lie.
Shuggie, say it with me...

22:30.515 --> 22:34.561
Shuggie is a carnivore. I eat meat.

22:34.978 --> 22:37.606
Bamboo is why there's only
a few dozen of us left.

22:37.689 --> 22:40.484
Hold up, wait a minute. You can talk?

22:40.734 --> 22:45.197
Normally, people say,
"Wow, Shuggie, you can play the guitar?"

22:45.322 --> 22:47.491
Come on, man.
We're breakin' you outta here.

22:47.616 --> 22:51.244
Slow your roll, boo-boo.
Shuggie is not going an-ty-where.

22:51.328 --> 22:53.455
I can't believe he's actually talking.

22:53.663 --> 22:56.124
You don't understand,
we're settin' you free.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.876
If you can top free food,

22:58.335 --> 23:00.629
free lodgin', and some mating...

23:00.921 --> 23:02.047
I'm here to stay.

23:02.506 --> 23:05.634
So let go of them claws,
unless you're gonna massage them paws.

23:05.842 --> 23:08.053
Wouldn't you feel better
in your natural habitat?

23:08.178 --> 23:09.805
Okay, now, look around,

23:10.138 --> 23:11.598
tell me what you see.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.558
You see a 75-inch TV, don't you?

23:13.892 --> 23:16.353
You see a refrigerator
full of spring water, don't you?

23:16.686 --> 23:19.106
You see a king-size
Sleep Number bed, don't you?

23:19.356 --> 23:20.649
I'm a player.

23:20.732 --> 23:22.275
This is my natural habitat.

23:22.359 --> 23:24.361
I get it, you don't wanna be rescued.
Great!

23:25.570 --> 23:27.864
Let's go, Maya,
before the police get here.

23:27.948 --> 23:31.326
No, I'm gonna rescue him.
He doesn't know what he wants.

23:31.493 --> 23:33.286
Maybe he does, maybe he doesn't.

23:33.370 --> 23:35.205
But he weighs 400 pounds,

23:35.288 --> 23:37.457
which means there's nothing
we can do about it!

23:37.541 --> 23:40.085
Ugh. You actin' real lame right now.

23:40.293 --> 23:41.420
No, I'm not!

23:41.503 --> 23:43.422
It's just that he seems happy.

23:46.800 --> 23:49.678
But, if this is what you wanna do,
then I guess...

23:49.761 --> 23:52.222
Penny, remember how we raised you.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.893
You know what? You're right.

23:57.018 --> 24:02.107
I am lame, inconsequential,
superficial, and a fool.

24:02.315 --> 24:05.110
Because I was willing
to do anything to be your friend.

24:05.193 --> 24:08.029
I don't know if seeing the light
the other night confused me,

24:08.155 --> 24:11.533
but as of now,
I am officially no longer confused.

24:11.825 --> 24:13.493
You're the superficial one.

24:13.785 --> 24:17.497
Not to mention pushy, delusional,
and hard-headed.

24:17.789 --> 24:21.334
The bear just told you he's happy,
but you won't hear it.

24:21.460 --> 24:24.254
Well, I did,
and I am not kidnapping a bear.

24:24.546 --> 24:28.842
That's federal time. And I'm through
letting you kidnap me. I'm out!

24:28.967 --> 24:30.093
Where you goin'?

24:30.343 --> 24:32.345
To hang out with my "squad."

24:32.512 --> 24:34.514
They may not be all that to you,

24:34.806 --> 24:37.809
but at least they appreciate me
for being me.

24:38.101 --> 24:41.062
Nice to meet you, Mr. Shuggie.
Keep doin' you.

24:43.356 --> 24:45.650
Now, see, Shuggie like her.

24:45.901 --> 24:48.945
But you, Miss Thing, not so much.

24:52.324 --> 24:55.160
Trudy, I'm going to the Wiz Mall
to get a lottery ticket.

24:55.243 --> 24:57.871
- I'll be right back.
- Take the twins with you, Oscar.

24:57.954 --> 24:59.873
Damn, woman,
can I have a moment to myself?

24:59.956 --> 25:02.751
Besides, I don't even have no car seats
in the car. Now, bye!

25:09.341 --> 25:10.467
Semper fi?

25:11.718 --> 25:13.053
Semper lie.

25:13.803 --> 25:16.056
Fresh from the toes up
Fresh from the toe

25:16.139 --> 25:18.391
Fresh from the toes up
Fresh from the toe

25:18.475 --> 25:20.977
I ain't gotta dance
I ain't, I ain't gotta dance

25:21.061 --> 25:22.062
I ain't gotta dance...

25:22.145 --> 25:24.105
Hey, guys. So, who got KG?

25:24.231 --> 25:25.440
They did.

25:25.649 --> 25:26.650
Jeez.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.739
Guess he's not into girls, huh?

25:32.822 --> 25:34.449
- That's what's up.
- Or you, Michael.

25:34.533 --> 25:35.534
Hater.

25:35.659 --> 25:38.620
Uh-oh. Dad at ten o' clock.

25:42.749 --> 25:44.543
You wanna explain this to me, young lady?

25:44.626 --> 25:49.172
Oh! Thanks, Dad.
I have been lookin' all over for these.

25:50.340 --> 25:54.803
You know this camouflage stuff
really works, it just blends right in.

25:54.886 --> 25:58.348
You got me twisted. I won't let you
dance with a boy, lookin' like...

25:58.473 --> 26:00.350
- like a...
- Like a girl?

26:02.227 --> 26:04.938
Look, Dad, there's nothing to worry about.

26:05.021 --> 26:08.149
- No boys are asking us to dance anyway.
- Good.

26:15.323 --> 26:17.284
Wait a minute,
what kind of squares are these?

26:17.576 --> 26:18.702
Squares?

26:18.868 --> 26:21.580
Yeah, you know. Nerds, geeks,
losers, lame-os.

26:21.663 --> 26:24.791
Back in the day, we'd jump at the chance
to dance with a pretty girl.

26:24.874 --> 26:26.042
Well, I know I'm pretty.

26:33.633 --> 26:36.761
'Cause I'm so, so done

26:37.596 --> 26:40.390
Guardin' my tongue, holdin' me back

26:40.473 --> 26:43.685
- Don't even think about it.
- Oh! Yes, sir.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.271
Now, go and enjoy your life.

26:48.106 --> 26:49.691
Daddy, we need to talk.

26:51.067 --> 26:52.068
Now sit.

26:52.152 --> 26:54.654
- Now, hold on a minute, young lady.
- I said sit.

26:54.738 --> 26:56.865
I'm sorry, what did I do, Mama?
I mean, Penny.

26:56.948 --> 26:58.575
You're not paying attention to me.

26:58.783 --> 27:01.745
There's a lot goin' in my life
right now, okay?

27:01.828 --> 27:03.121
I'm changing.

27:04.331 --> 27:07.334
Yeah, I know, baby girl.
I saw that the other day.

27:07.417 --> 27:10.670
And I'm not gonna always
be your baby girl.

27:10.879 --> 27:12.922
One day, I'm gonna go to high school,

27:13.006 --> 27:14.591
go to college, get a job,

27:14.674 --> 27:16.843
- get married, have children...
- Hold on.

27:17.135 --> 27:20.847
- Slow down, baby girl.
- Listen to me, Daddy. You never listen.

27:21.014 --> 27:24.184
Okay, okay. You know what? You becomin'
like your mama more every day.

27:24.267 --> 27:26.394
- I'm listenin'.
- I'm a woman.

27:27.437 --> 27:28.938
At least I'm becoming one.

27:29.689 --> 27:33.276
And you just have to trust that you
and Mama did a good job raising me.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.653
Okay?

27:36.196 --> 27:37.238
Okay?

27:38.073 --> 27:40.533
Now, I'm gonna go over there
and dance with a boy,

27:40.617 --> 27:42.202
just like all the other girls.

27:42.869 --> 27:44.496
Do you have a problem with that?

27:45.705 --> 27:46.915
As long as he's Michael.

27:46.998 --> 27:48.667
- Daddy!
- All right, all right, go ahead.

27:48.750 --> 27:49.751
I ain't got no problem.

27:49.834 --> 27:52.379
Thank you, Daddy. I knew you'd understand.

27:57.717 --> 27:58.718
Uh. Hmm.

28:00.303 --> 28:02.180
She is definitely her mama's baby.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.849
I feel sorry for every boy
on that dance floor.

28:05.183 --> 28:06.434
I'm tellin' you.
