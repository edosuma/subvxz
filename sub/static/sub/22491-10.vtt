00:17.263 --> 00:19.094
It's alive!

00:37.449 --> 00:40.179
One, two, three.

00:40.218 --> 00:41.708
Paper beats face!

00:41.753 --> 00:43.584
One, two, three.

00:43.621 --> 00:45.748
Rock punches nuts!

00:45.790 --> 00:47.849
One, two, three.

00:47.892 --> 00:50.690
- Scissors in your anus.
- I hate this game.

00:52.096 --> 00:54.963
Our Care Bear franchise
is on the brink of collapse.

00:54.999 --> 00:59.526
Corrupted by impure creatures
that leach off our sunshine land.

00:59.570 --> 01:02.266
I'm talking of course
about the Care Bear Cousins.

01:02.306 --> 01:03.705
Care Bear Cousins suck!

01:03.740 --> 01:06.834
I may be Love-A-Lot Bear,
but I can hate a lot, too.

01:06.877 --> 01:10.438
We can no longer ignore
the elephant in the room.

01:10.481 --> 01:12.346
Did I miss something?

01:12.382 --> 01:15.874
We must send them all
to the Great Cloud Keeper in the sky.

01:15.919 --> 01:16.908
Bedtime Bear.

01:16.954 --> 01:19.320
Y'all know what time it is.
It's bedtime!

01:19.356 --> 01:23.883
And by bed, I mean ethnic,
and by time, I mean cleansing.

01:25.294 --> 01:27.228
Care-a-Lot!
Care-a-Lot!

01:27.263 --> 01:29.527
- Care-a-lot!
- Stop.

01:29.565 --> 01:31.795
Famous character actor
Don Cheadle.

01:31.834 --> 01:33.165
You don't have to do this.

01:33.202 --> 01:35.762
I've built a hotel
where the Cousins can be safe.

01:35.805 --> 01:37.830
Yeah, we can keep
the corpses in there.

01:37.874 --> 01:40.809
No, that's not what I meant at all.

01:40.843 --> 01:43.573
I loved you in Swordfish, Mr. Cheadle.

01:43.613 --> 01:47.048
- Can I have your autograph?
- OK.

01:47.082 --> 01:49.141
I'm Lots-a-Laughs Bear...

01:49.184 --> 01:54.019
and I've gathered y'all here today
for a special, happy celebration.

01:58.460 --> 02:00.655
If it's a special, happy celebration...

02:00.695 --> 02:02.925
then why am I crapping
a load in my drawers?

02:08.169 --> 02:11.569
We did it!
We killed all the Care Bear Cousins!

02:11.605 --> 02:13.539
Hooray for murder!

02:13.574 --> 02:18.307
Now let us celebrate our genocide!
Get your party on!

02:19.346 --> 02:21.678
Everyone, eat some rainbow!

02:22.783 --> 02:24.546
That's good rainbow.

02:28.789 --> 02:31.724
It's the Great Cloud Keeper in the sky!

02:31.759 --> 02:35.956
Care Bears, I have watched
your actions with great displeasure.

02:35.995 --> 02:38.486
But we purified the land of Care-a-Lot.

02:38.531 --> 02:40.624
For your dark and terrible deeds...

02:40.667 --> 02:44.296
I shall turn Care-a-Lot
into a dark and terrible place.

02:44.337 --> 02:47.363
A hell on earth,
I shall turn Care-a-Lot into...

02:47.407 --> 02:49.034
New Jersey.

02:54.247 --> 02:57.113
Hello, I'm New Jersey's Governor,
Jon Corzine.

02:57.149 --> 03:00.607
I hope you've enjoyed this reenactment
of our State's proud history.

03:00.652 --> 03:02.415
The Garden State.

03:02.454 --> 03:04.718
Come get in on some of this rainbow.

03:24.742 --> 03:25.936
Did you get it?

03:27.812 --> 03:32.215
Nice shoes, but they'd look
much better in my pants.

03:32.249 --> 03:35.844
Wait, I mean,
are you from heaven?

03:35.886 --> 03:38.081
'Cause I've got an erection.

03:46.262 --> 03:47.593
Rob Schneider.

03:47.631 --> 03:50.896
If he wasn't so handsome,
I would stop seeing his movies.

03:50.934 --> 03:53.926
- Don't you agree, little Heimlich?
- Ya, papa.

03:58.608 --> 04:00.075
Look out my papa!

04:03.213 --> 04:04.202
Papa!

04:09.084 --> 04:10.346
Papa!

04:10.386 --> 04:11.580
No!

04:15.624 --> 04:19.754
And punch and kick, and punch and kick,
and punch and kick...

04:19.795 --> 04:22.958
and jazz hands,
and punch, and good.

04:22.998 --> 04:25.489
Good, young Heimlich.
You are learning very fast.

04:25.534 --> 04:28.799
- Are you ready to face your deepest fear?
- Yeah.

04:32.473 --> 04:34.600
- He's choking!
- He's a goner, Heimlich.

04:34.642 --> 04:37.008
Nein, he's practice.

04:43.584 --> 04:46.678
Heimlich, that maneuver
is the key to your greatness.

04:46.721 --> 04:47.983
You are ready.

04:57.931 --> 05:01.367
The Choker!
His portions are always too big.

05:02.569 --> 05:04.696
Heimlich, do the maneuver!

05:11.511 --> 05:13.741
Heimlich, how can we ever thank you?

05:13.780 --> 05:15.873
Mit bratwurst and beer.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.976
And that is how I,
Joel Schumacher, see it.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.714
It's always sausage with you, isn't it?

05:21.754 --> 05:24.086
Mary had a little lamb.

05:25.124 --> 05:27.558
Mary had a little lamb.

05:30.930 --> 05:34.661
Mary had a... little lamb.

05:40.906 --> 05:43.635
Ricky, the doctors
say the accident left you mute.

05:43.675 --> 05:46.337
Do you know what that means?

05:46.377 --> 05:49.244
It means you can't talk no more!

05:49.280 --> 05:52.772
But just because you can't talk,
don't mean you can't communicate.

05:52.817 --> 05:56.275
Look what I got you.
You wear this everywhere you go.

05:58.656 --> 06:00.715
Kick it over here,
Hi, my name is Ricky.

06:01.893 --> 06:04.691
Nice job on defense,
Hi, my name is Ricky.

06:04.729 --> 06:07.697
You suck. You seriously
fucking suck dude.

06:13.837 --> 06:17.568
Ricky, the doctors
say the accident left you mostly deaf.

06:17.608 --> 06:19.132
Do you know what that means?

06:19.176 --> 06:21.872
I said do you know what that means?

06:21.912 --> 06:25.040
Well, anyway, this is just another
challenge, huh, champo?

06:25.082 --> 06:27.312
I got you these hearing aids.

06:29.486 --> 06:32.420
Nice hustle,
Hello, I'm hearing impaired.

06:33.322 --> 06:36.849
You kind of suck,
Hello, I'm hearing impaired.

06:42.932 --> 06:46.197
Ricky, the doctors
say the accident affected your brain.

06:46.235 --> 06:48.567
We don't really know
what that means yet...

06:48.604 --> 06:51.767
but I got you these googly eye glasses.

06:53.910 --> 06:55.774
We won,
Howdy, I have brain damage!

06:55.811 --> 06:58.644
Three cheers for
Howdy, I have brain damage.

07:02.184 --> 07:04.778
That was really something.
Which kid is yours?

07:04.820 --> 07:07.152
That fat Asian kid.

07:08.456 --> 07:10.014
Oh, my God!

07:10.058 --> 07:12.618
Jeffrey, we're out of ice cream!

07:23.971 --> 07:27.463
Look, Potter, I taught
the Sorting Hat a new trick.

07:27.508 --> 07:29.373
Virgin!

07:29.410 --> 07:33.073
Looks like Potter
is He Who Shall Not Be Laid.

07:33.113 --> 07:36.173
Guess the monster Pubertus
hasn't caught up with you yet.

07:36.217 --> 07:38.617
Pubertus is just a myth, Malfoy.

07:38.652 --> 07:40.347
Second base.

07:40.387 --> 07:45.551
Class, today we shall be learning spells
which give objects the property of wood.

07:45.592 --> 07:49.153
Property of wood?
That's happening to me right now.

07:49.195 --> 07:50.184
Pubertus.

07:50.230 --> 07:54.030
Professor Dumbledore, I think
the monster Pubertus has cursed me.

07:54.067 --> 07:55.500
- Yo.
- Who are you?

07:55.535 --> 07:58.868
- Harry, it's me. Dumbledore.
- But Dumbledore isn't...

07:58.905 --> 08:01.567
Listen I'm a different actor
in every movie.

08:01.608 --> 08:04.270
Here, this might aid you.
It was your dad's.

08:04.310 --> 08:05.368
It's engraved.

08:05.411 --> 08:09.813
"This handy stone fits in your palm,
but only heat will turn it on. "

08:09.848 --> 08:11.247
I know what turns me on.

08:11.283 --> 08:15.743
Halle Berry in Swordfish.
DVD's pauses.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.687
- Oh, no!
- What is it, Ron?

08:17.723 --> 08:21.159
The monster Pubertus
has cursed me, too.

08:21.193 --> 08:22.683
He's even cursed Scabbers.

08:22.728 --> 08:25.526
- All right, you can stop now.
- What are we going to do?

08:25.564 --> 08:28.397
- Let's ask Hagrid for help.
- Don't be ridiculous, Hermione.

08:28.433 --> 08:30.923
We need to confront
the terrible horror ourselves...

08:30.968 --> 08:33.333
and potentially end up
hospitalized like always.

08:33.371 --> 08:35.236
All right, just finish.

08:35.273 --> 08:38.936
Professor Snape, Harry and Ron have been
cursed by the monster Pubertus.

08:38.976 --> 08:40.534
Pubertus, eh?

08:40.578 --> 08:44.981
Let's discuss this further
in my magical jacuzzi.

08:45.016 --> 08:49.851
Barry Whitus,
Candle Lightus, Girl Excitus.

08:49.887 --> 08:52.720
¤ Get into my tub ¤

08:53.323 --> 08:57.316
So, shall we play
put the Sorting Hat on the Slytherin?

08:57.360 --> 08:59.487
Pedophilius Repelus!

08:59.529 --> 09:03.124
According to legend,
Pubertus lives in this dungeon.

09:03.166 --> 09:05.293
Harry, I'm scared.

09:05.335 --> 09:07.428
You're always scared,
you chicken shit.

09:07.470 --> 09:08.801
I can't help it!

09:08.838 --> 09:12.069
I'm a scared, pimple-faced,
red headed chicken shit virgin!

09:12.108 --> 09:14.770
Ron, shush.
Do you hear that noise?

09:15.712 --> 09:17.008
Pubertus!

09:17.046 --> 09:19.344
Hormones Controlus!

09:19.381 --> 09:24.011
"Only heat will turn it on. "
I must have to rub this stone.

09:28.023 --> 09:29.047
It worked!

09:30.392 --> 09:32.860
Quickly, Harry, rub it out again!

09:39.201 --> 09:42.067
Harry, rub another one out! Quickly!

09:42.103 --> 09:45.732
I'm rubbing as hard as I can!
The stone is getting all chaffed.

09:45.773 --> 09:48.207
Harry, I forgot to explain.

09:48.242 --> 09:52.076
The Rubbing Stone can only
be used three times in a day.

09:52.113 --> 09:54.343
Four, if you take a week off.

09:54.382 --> 09:56.475
Then how do we defeat Pubertus?

09:56.517 --> 10:00.578
Man, you can't defeat Pubertus!
He lives inside y'all.

10:00.621 --> 10:03.351
Just as my own demon,
Wandas Limpus...

10:03.391 --> 10:06.188
prevents me from having
meaningful relationships.
