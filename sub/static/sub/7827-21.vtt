What do babies know?

Maggie, can you point

-MARGE: Homer, you didn't do

a very good job frosting
Maggie's birthday cake.

01:16.242 --> 01:20.163

"Magaggie's" birthday?

Oh.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.795
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Stop it!

01:26.878 --> 01:28.630
I made a special cake

01:35.553 --> 01:38.056
Hello, everyone,
except Homer.

01:38.139 --> 01:41.142
Happy birthday,
granddaughter.

01:41.226 --> 01:44.187
Marge, I think that's your
father-in-law across the street.

01:45.814 --> 01:49.526
Happy birthday!

01:49.609 --> 01:51.653
Everybody get ready.

01:51.736 --> 01:53.738
Here comes
the birthday girl

01:53.822 --> 01:56.825
in her very first
dress.

01:56.908 --> 01:58.076
ALL: Aww!

01:58.159 --> 02:00.411
She's a little angel.

02:00.495 --> 02:04.374
Yeah. I wanna put a hook in her
and hang her from our Christmas tree.

02:04.457 --> 02:06.876
What smells?

02:06.960 --> 02:08.128
Uh-oh.

02:11.881 --> 02:14.342
Shouldn't we wait for the other babies
before we open the presents?

02:14.425 --> 02:16.052
We didn't invite
the other babies.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.513
Maggie doesn't seem to get
along with the other babies.

02:24.519 --> 02:27.939
MARGE: Maggie, we have
a surprise for you!

Ooh, put some Lister's Carbolic Unguent
on a wad of cotton.

02:42.370 --> 02:43.830
Put the cotton
in her ear.

02:43.913 --> 02:45.165
That'll stop them shakes.

02:45.248 --> 02:48.585
No, no. What she needs
is a Balsam Specific.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.128
Balsam Specific!

02:50.211 --> 02:52.380
Oof-- While we're
burning money,

02:52.463 --> 02:55.425
why don't we give her a curative
galvanic belt too?

02:55.508 --> 02:58.178
(raspy voice) Don't forget
to give her Smeckler's powder.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.512
BOTH:
Don't make fun.

03:02.974 --> 03:05.602
I remember Lisa's
third birthday.

03:05.685 --> 03:09.189
She and Bart did this adorable
little song and dance routine.

Oh! (laughs)

03:10.899 --> 03:12.817

Homie, you know
it's funny,

04:31.187 --> 04:34.274
both my mother and your father
seem pretty lonely.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.401
(giggles)
That is funny.

04:36.484 --> 04:39.862
Yeah. Anyway, maybe they could
go to a matinee together,

04:39.946 --> 04:42.407
or shopping,
or to that room in the library

04:42.490 --> 04:44.117
that's always full
of old people--

04:44.200 --> 04:45.702
Periodicals, that's it!

04:45.785 --> 04:49.622
Marge, please, old people
don't need companionship.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.541
They need to be
isolated and studied,

04:51.624 --> 04:53.543
so it can be determined
what nutrients they have

04:53.626 --> 04:55.712
that might be extracted
for our personal use.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.797
Homer, would you please stop
reading that Ross Perot pamphlet?

04:57.880 --> 04:59.257
Oh!

05:04.137 --> 05:06.556
Say, I've got
a neat idea.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.016
Why don't you go in
and pick up my mother,

05:08.099 --> 05:09.600
and we'll go out to dinner?

05:09.684 --> 05:11.269
I'll be back
in a jiffy!

05:16.357 --> 05:17.567
That's not my mother.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.736
I'll be back
in a jiffy!

05:21.696 --> 05:25.241
Can I come too?

05:25.325 --> 05:26.284
Oh.

05:26.367 --> 05:30.371
(electrical buzzing)

05:33.166 --> 05:36.419
You know, Mom, you and Abe
have a lot in common.

05:36.502 --> 05:39.047
Um-- Hmm.

05:39.130 --> 05:42.050
You both got swindled
by that telemarketing scam.

05:42.133 --> 05:45.511
Oh, it's not a swindle.
What you do is, see,

05:45.595 --> 05:47.764
you give them all
your credit card numbers,

05:47.847 --> 05:52.060
and if one of them is lucky,
they'll send you a prize.

05:52.143 --> 05:55.438
I was just happy to talk
to someone on the phone.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.899
Aw, feelin' blue, eh?

05:57.982 --> 05:59.817

06:20.380 --> 06:22.632

-(both grunting)

06:27.011 --> 06:28.930

of me getting arrested

06:29.013 --> 06:30.765
for indecent exposure.

06:30.848 --> 06:34.227
It was the most embarrassing day
of my life.

06:34.310 --> 06:36.938

06:37.021 --> 06:39.357
You were one
nifty number.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.275
The boys all paid attention
to me

06:41.359 --> 06:43.945
and it drove
my friends crazy.

06:44.028 --> 06:45.655
Oh, who were
your friends?

06:45.738 --> 06:47.448
Oh, Zelda Fitzgerald,

06:47.532 --> 06:50.118
Frances Farmer,
and little Sylvia Plath.

06:50.201 --> 06:54.747
You know, you remind me of
a poem I can't remember

06:54.831 --> 06:57.250
and a song that may
never have existed

06:57.333 --> 07:00.545
and a place I'm not sure
I've ever been to.

07:00.628 --> 07:02.171

reason could you have

08:44.815 --> 08:47.235

being in love?

08:47.318 --> 08:51.072
If he marries your mother, Marge,
we'll be brother and sister!

08:51.155 --> 08:53.574

they'll be horrible freaks

If you do not open
the door, Mr. Simpson,

09:53.718 --> 09:56.637
I cannot give you your...
special delivery.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.725

Here's your
special delivery.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.273
-Thanks. (groans)
-That's for keepin' me waiting.

who's got a genuine

animation cel?

10:13.529 --> 10:16.115
Oh! That is so cool!
That is so exciting!

10:16.198 --> 10:17.283
That is so--

10:19.327 --> 10:20.661

of Scratchy's arm.

10:22.663 --> 10:26.792

credit card to buy this?

-$350.

10:30.546 --> 10:33.090

See?

10:54.945 --> 10:57.073
Dad, that will never work.

10:57.156 --> 11:02.328
If you wanna make your move,
you gotta play it cool.

11:02.411 --> 11:04.497
(jazzy singsong)
Now, what you gotta do,

11:04.580 --> 11:06.916
if you wanna get a kiss,

11:06.999 --> 11:11.462
is act real smooth
and make your move like this.

11:11.545 --> 11:15.841
-(yawns)
-Oh, I see.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.094
So, if I take
your advice

11:18.177 --> 11:20.554
and make your
patented move,

11:20.638 --> 11:25.101
then my chances for love
will slightly improve.

This-- This is a Snagglepuss
drawn by Hic Heisler.

11:55.756 --> 11:57.299
It is worth something.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.927
This-- This is an arm
drawn by nobody.

12:00.010 --> 12:01.387
It is worth nothing.

12:01.470 --> 12:03.556
Can't you give me
anything for it?

12:03.639 --> 12:06.142
I can give you this telephone.
It is shaped like Mary Worth.

gasket, Charlie.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.183
Well, would it be
all right with you

in the street and died?

14:13.686 --> 14:14.812

You had sex with that

14:26.740 --> 14:28.325
She said "no" to me.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.494
Do you know how many
women have said "no" to me?

14:30.578 --> 14:33.706

I've become a billionaire.

14:33.789 --> 14:37.001
And she's the one
for me. I'm in love!

14:37.084 --> 14:39.545

-Yes, whoop-dee-do.

14:39.628 --> 14:42.131

Darling one: Read my words
and hear my heart

15:13.621 --> 15:16.040

A love that will
be with you always.

Sincerely,

15:20.461 --> 15:21.587

15:21.670 --> 15:23.213
How did you think
of that so fast?

15:23.297 --> 15:25.966
I... sent it to you
on your birthday.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.344
(sniffles) Excuse me.
I have something in my eye.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.262
Hmm.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.348
Mom's almost ready
for her date.

15:32.431 --> 15:35.017
She sure seems taken
by this new beau.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.227
I feel so bad
for Grampa.

Dad says this new guy is a repulsive,
obnoxious old billionaire.

So, let's all
be extra nice to him.

I brought chocolates.

16:03.253 --> 16:04.922
Yabba dabba do!

16:05.005 --> 16:08.759
He's an awful, awful,
awful man.

16:08.842 --> 16:10.928
I guess if he makes Mom happy,
that's all that really matters.

16:11.011 --> 16:13.138
That's right, "money."

16:13.222 --> 16:16.475
Your "money's" happiness
is all that "moneys."

16:16.558 --> 16:19.353
-(exhales)
-Hmm.

16:19.436 --> 16:22.856
Hi. You know, Grandma
really likes it

16:22.940 --> 16:24.733
when her boyfriends
are nice to me.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.945
She especially likes it
when they give me money.

16:28.028 --> 16:29.947
Run along, peewee.
Baby gets nothing.

16:30.030 --> 16:31.824
Very well, you leave me
no choice.

16:31.907 --> 16:34.326

is filled with ketchup.

16:34.410 --> 16:37.871

Now give me $350 bucks

16:37.955 --> 16:39.832
or you're gonna be a mess
for your date.

16:39.915 --> 16:41.917
You don't have
the guts.

16:45.379 --> 16:46.839

16:55.556 --> 16:59.393
-Hmm?
-Ooh.

17:01.353 --> 17:04.523
Oh, why'd she
have to leave me?

17:04.606 --> 17:05.774
Hi, Abe.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.068
We heard you was in need
of some cheering up.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.821
So we got you
a special cake.

17:10.904 --> 17:12.072

finest bottle of vino.

Hey, you trust Luigi.

really nice the amore.

romantic restaurant.

17:32.968 --> 17:36.263

zombie he's-a captured.

17:36.346 --> 17:40.559
Dad, I'm really sorry,
but I charged $350 on your credit card.

17:40.642 --> 17:43.395
-What?
-Don't worry. Here's the cash.

17:43.479 --> 17:46.065
Whoo-hoo! $350.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.692
Now, I can buy
70 transcripts of Nightline.

Will you marry me?

Oh! Mom, you can't marry
Mr. Burns. He's an evil man.

18:39.660 --> 18:42.996
Evil, schmevil, Marge.
Monty can provide for me.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.082
Besides, he's
a great kisser.

18:45.165 --> 18:46.625
Ew! Yuck!

18:46.708 --> 18:49.086

18:51.421 --> 18:53.006
Oh, he's a dear,

18:53.090 --> 18:54.633
but he's too much
of an old fusspot.

18:54.716 --> 18:57.177
We're all aware
of Grampa's problems,

18:57.261 --> 19:00.556
but compared to Mr. Burns,
he's Judge freaking Reinhold.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.017
I don't know
who that is.

19:04.101 --> 19:06.645
Oh! Who needs her?
