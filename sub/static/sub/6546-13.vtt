00:02.170 --> 00:03.159
Audrey: Previously on "Haven"...

00:03.254 --> 00:05.245
- Audrey is sick.
Charlotte is helping her.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.920
- Sick? With what?

00:07.008 --> 00:08.964
- Just started.
Could be the split from Mara.

00:09.051 --> 00:10.587
Charlotte: There's something
strange happening to you.

00:10.678 --> 00:12.134
On a cellular level,
you're going through

00:12.221 --> 00:14.086
rapid waves of deterioration.

00:14.182 --> 00:15.763
I've never seen anything like it.

00:15.850 --> 00:18.842
- Finding Aether is key.
- Why?

00:18.936 --> 00:20.016
- To fix you.

00:20.104 --> 00:22.345
- The Aether. Where is it?
- It's missing.

00:22.440 --> 00:25.102
- Mara is looking everywhere
for an open thinny.

00:27.695 --> 00:30.152
(screams)

00:30.239 --> 00:34.073
Vince: Your adoption, Croatoan,
your visions are all tied together.

00:34.160 --> 00:36.526
Audrey: The CDC has no idea
that you're here.

00:36.621 --> 00:38.612
Where did you get this?
- I'll tell you everything.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.321
But first, I want my ring.

00:40.416 --> 00:41.952
This ring... it's part of a set.

00:42.043 --> 00:43.954
Every member
in our family has one.

00:44.045 --> 00:45.706
- I can feel her.
- Who are you?

00:45.796 --> 00:47.787
- I'm your mother.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.173
- Stop lying.

00:55.264 --> 00:57.926
- I have.

00:58.017 --> 00:59.473
It's the truth.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.391
- What?

01:02.396 --> 01:04.682
- Mara...

01:04.774 --> 01:08.107
is my daughter.

01:08.194 --> 01:10.731
- How? You're too...

01:10.821 --> 01:14.359
- I'm about 1,100 in your years.

01:14.450 --> 01:17.157
Mara's 600-ish.

01:17.245 --> 01:19.486
- Why should we believe you?

01:19.580 --> 01:21.696
- You can feel me, Nathan.

01:21.791 --> 01:24.157
And how else would
I possibly have this ring?

01:25.711 --> 01:27.747
I'll tell you.

01:27.838 --> 01:30.329
Because everyone
in my family has one,

01:30.424 --> 01:34.042
including my daughter, Mara,
who I need to see.

01:34.136 --> 01:36.343
That's why I'm here.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.261
- Here...

01:38.349 --> 01:41.091
from where?

01:46.482 --> 01:48.894
- See these two microscopes?

01:48.985 --> 01:52.523
They're both made of similar parts,
do similar things,

01:52.613 --> 01:55.025
but were developed
completely independently.

01:55.116 --> 01:57.357
And one is far more advanced.

01:59.745 --> 02:01.827
But like these microscopes,

02:01.914 --> 02:04.200
my world and yours,

02:04.292 --> 02:06.874
were developed independently,

02:06.961 --> 02:10.545
with mine more advanced
and far away.

02:10.631 --> 02:13.873
And they must stay...

02:13.968 --> 02:15.674
separated.

02:15.761 --> 02:17.717
- Yeah.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.796
I agree.

02:19.890 --> 02:22.051
- Dwight, I know I lied--

02:22.143 --> 02:24.509
- Get a friend.
Come to the lab.

02:24.603 --> 02:27.060
We're keeping Charlotte Cross
in lockdown.

02:27.148 --> 02:29.059
- You must believe me.

02:29.150 --> 02:32.142
My daughter is very dangerous,
that's why I'm here.

02:32.236 --> 02:34.147
To take her away

02:34.238 --> 02:37.651
and hopefully undo
whatever damage she's done.

02:41.329 --> 02:43.320
- (distant chattering)

02:52.381 --> 02:54.042
- Hey. You're the owner, right?

02:55.051 --> 02:56.712
- No.
- Right.

02:56.802 --> 02:58.633
- You should make
your own Kahlua.

02:58.721 --> 03:01.053
It's not hard and the White Russians
would be a lot better.

03:01.140 --> 03:05.008
- Shh.
Please go away.

03:05.102 --> 03:07.218
- Sir, I'm a customer
and I'm correcting a problem

03:07.313 --> 03:08.723
in your establishment.

03:08.814 --> 03:11.806
- Lady, I know problems.

03:11.901 --> 03:15.689
And store-bought Kahlua
is not a problem.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.857
Go.

03:29.502 --> 03:30.867
- Nice. Bugs.

03:32.338 --> 03:34.169
(gasps)

03:34.256 --> 03:35.837
Of course,
defective glassware.

03:35.925 --> 03:37.461
- Hey, lady...
- No.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.633
We'll be taking
our business elsewhere.

03:41.013 --> 03:43.675
- Look, do not touch
anything else!

03:43.766 --> 03:45.222
- Come on, Jeffery.

03:47.686 --> 03:50.268
- I told you
not to touch anything!

03:50.356 --> 03:52.438
- (screams)

03:52.525 --> 03:54.390
- (people clamoring)

03:56.028 --> 03:57.984
- Okay.

03:58.072 --> 04:00.609
Time for me to go see a doctor.

04:00.699 --> 04:03.111
J‘J‘

04:32.189 --> 04:34.180
Nathan: So the void
separates our worlds?

04:35.776 --> 04:39.143
- Like a DMZ.
Not a place anyone should stay.

04:39.238 --> 04:42.355
Mara and William
took Aether from the void

04:42.450 --> 04:43.690
and brought it here.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.116
- Why?

04:46.203 --> 04:48.660
Why would Mara bring
the Troubles here?

04:48.747 --> 04:51.124
- For love.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.870
But it was misguided.

04:53.961 --> 04:57.294
When I found out,
I tried to correct the situation.

04:57.381 --> 04:59.622
Make a punishment
that yielded reparations

04:59.717 --> 05:03.209
and made my daughter realize
the error of her ways.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.465
- So the barn?

05:05.556 --> 05:07.797
The barn stole personalities

05:07.892 --> 05:10.349
from Sarah, Lucy, Audrey?

05:10.436 --> 05:11.892
To what?

05:11.979 --> 05:14.971
To teach your daughter a lesson?

05:15.065 --> 05:16.930
- And to help all of you.

05:17.026 --> 05:19.938
- Can you fix what Mara's done?

05:20.029 --> 05:22.315
- I've been hoping to figure out

05:22.406 --> 05:24.488
what Mara has done.

05:24.575 --> 05:28.113
That's why I chose
to be a CDC officer.

05:28.204 --> 05:30.786
It allowed me to investigate
Troubled people.

05:30.873 --> 05:32.864
- (coughing)

05:35.377 --> 05:38.119
- What about Audrey?

05:38.214 --> 05:40.250
Can you help her?
- I've been trying.

05:40.341 --> 05:44.175
But I thought that on the inside,
she was still Mara and not a...

05:45.554 --> 05:48.170
There can't be a copy,

05:48.265 --> 05:49.880
not-- not in one world.

05:49.975 --> 05:53.684
- So if you took Mara home,
then Audrey would get better?

05:53.771 --> 05:54.851
- Possibly.

05:54.939 --> 05:59.228
Look, our best chance
at fixing all of this

05:59.318 --> 06:02.651
is if you bring Mara to me.

06:02.738 --> 06:04.979
- Then I will.

06:07.910 --> 06:10.242
- So an hour ago,
we got multiple calls

06:10.329 --> 06:11.865
about an explosion
at The Grey Gull.

06:11.956 --> 06:13.821
Somebody also said
that they saw something

06:13.916 --> 06:15.827
float off of Duke
and hit somebody.

06:15.918 --> 06:18.500
So four units go
into the armory to gear up

06:18.587 --> 06:20.168
and they got locked in there.

06:20.256 --> 06:21.462
- What do you mean
"locked in there"?

06:21.549 --> 06:23.289
- Look at the door.

06:23.384 --> 06:26.501
The door knob is gone.
The keyhole is gone.

06:26.595 --> 06:28.972
The hinges are gone.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.921
It's a tomb in there.

06:35.020 --> 06:38.057
- What do you mean
you can't give me a sedative?

06:38.148 --> 06:42.482
I have to go to The Gull and pick up
a body with a sponge!

06:42.570 --> 06:44.811
- You don't need me
to give you a sedative.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.566
- Really?

06:47.866 --> 06:50.118
How about now?
Do you need to give me one now?

06:54.915 --> 06:57.748
- Hey.

06:57.835 --> 07:00.451
I'm Duke Crocker.

07:00.546 --> 07:03.413
- Right. Hi.

07:03.507 --> 07:05.589
- Um...

07:05.676 --> 07:09.260
Look, I know that you
helped Audrey and Dave Teagues.

07:09.346 --> 07:10.335
- Yeah.

07:10.431 --> 07:12.888
- I need you to help me, too.

07:12.975 --> 07:17.435
You see, I have
a lot of Troubles in me.

07:17.521 --> 07:20.263
And now it seems that I am...

07:20.357 --> 07:22.097
giving them out.

07:23.611 --> 07:26.774
- What do you mean,
"giving them out"?

07:26.864 --> 07:29.571
- These black tears
come out of my eyes

07:29.658 --> 07:31.649
and then they float
onto people, and...

07:33.495 --> 07:35.406
and then they get a Trouble.

07:35.497 --> 07:38.159
- Remove your shirt, please.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.241
I need to do some tests.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.262
Here.

07:54.350 --> 07:56.386
Look up.

07:56.477 --> 07:57.717
(cell phone vibrates)

07:57.811 --> 08:00.018
- Duke's probably still
our best bet at finding Mara,

08:00.105 --> 08:02.312
if he'd answer his phone.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.388
(cell phone chimes)

08:03.484 --> 08:06.066
Dwight's got a trouble
at the police station.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.235
- (coughing)

08:09.323 --> 08:11.814
(shivering)

08:13.327 --> 08:17.661
- You okay?
- I'm just so cold.

08:17.748 --> 08:20.785
- Well, we did just meet
your mother.

08:20.876 --> 08:22.582
Wow.

08:22.670 --> 08:25.082
Brr.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.208
Get inside.

08:27.299 --> 08:29.915
- (coughing)

08:30.010 --> 08:31.921
- Get you a coffee,
warm you up.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.344
Then we'll talk, okay?
- Thanks.

08:43.774 --> 08:46.106
(gasps)

08:46.193 --> 08:49.685
- Hello, Audrey Husk.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.526
- Mara.

08:53.617 --> 08:57.451
- This is so weird.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.032
- Yeah.

09:00.124 --> 09:02.285
- I'd say it's like
looking in a mirror,

09:02.376 --> 09:05.914
but you're so pale

09:06.004 --> 09:07.960
and weak.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.425
And that haircut?
(laughing)

09:10.509 --> 09:14.001
No. No, no, no.

09:14.096 --> 09:15.711
Mm-mm.

09:18.392 --> 09:19.882
Bourbon?

09:19.977 --> 09:21.717
- No.

09:21.812 --> 09:23.427
- And we have nothing in common.

09:23.522 --> 09:25.854
- Your mom.

09:25.941 --> 09:29.809
She wants to see you.
- I will not go and see her.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.643
- Why?
- If she really was your mother,

09:31.739 --> 09:33.149
you would know.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.903
But you can deliver
a message for me.

09:36.994 --> 09:39.736
Tell Mommie Dearest
to open a damn thinny

09:39.830 --> 09:41.320
so I can blow this clambake.

09:41.415 --> 09:42.700
Alone.

09:42.791 --> 09:44.531
Without her.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.457
She will say no,
and when she does,

09:46.545 --> 09:49.708
you tell her that
I've turned Duke Crocker

09:49.798 --> 09:52.665
into something...

09:52.760 --> 09:54.796
awesome.

09:54.887 --> 09:56.969
A concentration of new Troubles

09:57.055 --> 09:59.307
that no one has ever seen.

09:59.391 --> 10:02.679
And, yeah, a few of them
have leaked out,

10:02.770 --> 10:04.852
but those are just farts
in a dust storm.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.520
If my mom doesn't open a thinny
and let me leave

10:07.608 --> 10:10.645
by the end of the day,
Duke will blow.

10:10.736 --> 10:13.398
And Haven will see Troubles

10:13.489 --> 10:15.354
that will make the last 500 years

10:15.449 --> 10:17.064
look like a square dance.

10:17.159 --> 10:19.741
And two more things.

10:19.828 --> 10:21.739
One--

10:21.830 --> 10:24.617
anyone kills me, he explodes.

10:24.708 --> 10:27.666
And, two--
you're so pale.

10:27.753 --> 10:30.961
You really should
wear more blush.

10:31.048 --> 10:32.163
Here's some.

10:32.257 --> 10:34.589
(grunts)

10:34.676 --> 10:38.134
Oh!
That feels like therapy!

10:45.938 --> 10:47.849
- (chattering)

10:55.823 --> 10:58.735
- John-John, we are here
to learn about sustainable

10:58.826 --> 11:00.362
fishing practices.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.363
Can we do that if you are high?

11:02.454 --> 11:04.035
- I'm not high.

11:04.122 --> 11:06.579
The-- the rope, it moved by itself.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.534
- Oh, I see, the rope
moved all by itself,

11:09.628 --> 11:10.993
but you're not high.

11:11.088 --> 11:13.249
- (laughter)

11:21.473 --> 11:23.213
Teacher: Get off the boat!
- (screaming)

11:38.949 --> 11:40.064
(chains rattling)

11:49.126 --> 11:51.492
- (screaming continues)

11:51.587 --> 11:54.249
- Help!

11:54.339 --> 11:56.625
- Help, somebody!
Somebody!

11:56.717 --> 11:58.298
We're here! We're in here!

11:58.385 --> 12:00.467
- I am so fired.

12:00.554 --> 12:04.342
- I knew Charlotte Cross
wasn't from the CDC.

12:04.433 --> 12:07.015
- Yeah, but not from another world.

12:07.102 --> 12:08.512
- Another highball?

12:08.604 --> 12:12.347
- What?
The sun's past the yardarm.

12:12.441 --> 12:16.059
It's a wonder we're not
all drunks in this town.

12:17.905 --> 12:20.021
And my leg hurts!
- Where's your cream?

12:20.115 --> 12:22.902
- That woman gave me that stuff.
I'm not using it beca--

12:37.049 --> 12:38.880
- Okay, that's it.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.083
You are cut off.

12:43.722 --> 12:47.089
Oh, you had another vision,
didn't you?

12:51.939 --> 12:53.520
- Sorry I wasn't here.

12:54.691 --> 12:57.023
Maybe this is a good thing.

12:58.278 --> 13:01.111
We just tell Charlotte
what she wants, Mara leaves.

13:01.198 --> 13:03.564
What's wrong?

13:05.744 --> 13:07.860
- What do you think
Charlotte thinks of me?

13:07.955 --> 13:10.992
- I don't know.
I don't care.

13:11.083 --> 13:13.449
Do you?

13:16.338 --> 13:19.125
- Yeah.
I'm gonna go and talk to her.

13:19.216 --> 13:22.208
- Okay, let's go.
- No. Alone.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.009
(cell phone vibrating)
- Are you sure?

13:26.890 --> 13:29.552
- Besides, Dwight really
needs you down at the docks.

13:29.643 --> 13:32.635
You should go.
I'll meet up with you later.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.527
- (woman over P.A.)

13:44.408 --> 13:46.399
- I spoke to Mara.

13:48.912 --> 13:50.197
- Come in.

13:50.288 --> 13:52.825
Are you okay?

13:54.543 --> 13:58.081
- Just... no.

13:58.171 --> 14:01.334
- This is so odd for me.
- It is?

14:01.425 --> 14:04.542
- You look exactly
like my daughter.

14:04.636 --> 14:07.343
- But I'm not.

14:07.431 --> 14:11.390
- No. Mara's my daughter.

14:11.476 --> 14:15.264
- And whose daughter am I?

14:15.355 --> 14:17.687
- I don't know.
The Troubles', maybe?

14:20.027 --> 14:23.440
I'm sorry.
No one's, I guess.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.772
So what did Mara say?

14:26.867 --> 14:29.404
- She doesn't like you very much.

14:29.494 --> 14:32.531
She wants to go through a thinny...
without you.

14:32.622 --> 14:34.613
- Absolutely not.
That can't happen.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.244
She's far too unstable.

14:36.334 --> 14:37.995
- She said if you don't let her leave,

14:38.086 --> 14:41.078
she's gonna blow up a Trouble-bomb.

14:41.173 --> 14:43.038
Duke Crocker.

14:43.133 --> 14:45.374
Mara said that she
did something to Duke,

14:45.469 --> 14:47.630
and when he explodes,

14:47.721 --> 14:49.757
he'll fill this town

14:49.848 --> 14:52.180
full of the worst Troubles

14:52.267 --> 14:54.383
that anyone has ever seen.

14:54.478 --> 14:57.811
Unless you let her go
into the void...

14:57.898 --> 14:59.809
without you.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.640
- Unfortunately...

15:01.735 --> 15:04.568
I believe she's telling the truth
about Duke.

15:04.654 --> 15:06.986
He came to see me.
- He's here?

15:08.408 --> 15:10.649
- Come with me.
I'll show you.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.622
Duke?

15:18.794 --> 15:21.160
Duke.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.506
He left.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.922
- For where?
- I don't know.

15:26.009 --> 15:28.546
But it doesn't really matter because
I can't stop him from exploding

15:28.637 --> 15:31.299
and I will never let Mara
through a thinny alone.

15:31.389 --> 15:35.302
If it comes to it,
Duke Crocker will explode.

15:35.393 --> 15:37.600
- Please.
There must be something.

15:39.815 --> 15:42.773
- Seems like you would do anything
to save this town, Audrey.

15:42.859 --> 15:45.566
- I would.
They're my family.

15:45.654 --> 15:49.363
- Then we might have one solution.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.282
Dave: See?
Aspen, sugar maples.

15:52.369 --> 15:54.360
They do not grow
in North Carolina,

15:54.454 --> 15:56.490
but they do grow here.

15:56.581 --> 15:59.197
- You think your vision
was of a massacre

15:59.292 --> 16:00.748
that happened here once?

16:00.836 --> 16:02.997
People bludgeoned
with a rock, here?

16:03.088 --> 16:05.955
- Well, it may not be
in the history books,

16:06.049 --> 16:08.461
but neither are the Troubles.

16:08.552 --> 16:10.417
(bell dinging)

16:10.512 --> 16:11.592
(door closes)

16:11.680 --> 16:14.638
- Duke, what's wrong?

16:16.643 --> 16:19.180
- You two know more about
the Troubles than anyone.

16:19.271 --> 16:22.229
- A dubious distinction,
but, uh, yes.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.691
- How far do they go?

16:23.775 --> 16:27.518
I mean, what if a Troubled person
went out to sea or wherever?

16:27.612 --> 16:30.228
Dave: It usually includes us
writing a story

16:30.323 --> 16:33.030
about some freak squall
or strange current.

16:33.118 --> 16:35.700
- I need an answer!

16:35.787 --> 16:38.199
It's important.

16:39.624 --> 16:42.411
- I'm afraid Troubles

16:42.502 --> 16:44.993
always find people.

16:45.088 --> 16:46.419
- (sighs)

16:46.506 --> 16:50.169
So there is no good place
to expel a Trouble?

16:50.260 --> 16:52.171
Or a whole lot of them?

16:52.262 --> 16:53.377
- No.

16:53.471 --> 16:55.553
Except, I imagine,
where they came from.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.471
The void.

16:57.559 --> 16:59.470
- Right.

16:59.561 --> 17:01.472
Green misty spot on
the other side of a thinny.

17:01.563 --> 17:03.224
Which bus is that?

17:07.819 --> 17:09.150
What the hell was that?

17:09.237 --> 17:11.353
- Nothing.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.939
- All right, you two listen to me.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.696
If you know

17:16.786 --> 17:19.402
where an open thinny is,

17:19.497 --> 17:21.749
then you are gonna
tell me right now.

17:21.833 --> 17:25.291
Or I am gonna beat you to death...

17:25.378 --> 17:27.869
with him.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.380
(saw whirring)

17:33.470 --> 17:35.677
(banging)

17:35.764 --> 17:37.675
- As long as we keep the boat up,
the kids should be okay.

17:37.766 --> 17:39.097
But I could use more cops.

17:39.184 --> 17:41.175
- They're all still stuck
in the gun locker.

17:41.269 --> 17:42.509
- I think it might be
the same Trouble.

17:42.604 --> 17:44.515
One that locks people
inside places.

17:44.606 --> 17:46.642
And it might have come from Duke.

17:50.153 --> 17:52.018
- Thanks for letting
Charlotte leave the lab.

17:52.113 --> 17:55.697
She might be able to help save
Audrey and Duke and stop all this.

17:55.784 --> 17:57.615
- She's your responsibility now.

17:57.702 --> 17:59.693
Man: Look out!

17:59.788 --> 18:01.904
- (screaming)

18:04.626 --> 18:05.991
- All right,
cleat the boat to the dock.

18:06.086 --> 18:08.748
More lines!
We need more lines!

18:08.838 --> 18:12.751
Girl: We're here! We're in here!

18:16.054 --> 18:18.010
- Are we gonna let Mara go?
- No.

18:18.098 --> 18:20.805
It's far too dangerous.
For everyone.

18:20.892 --> 18:23.759
- There's another way
to get Mara to deactivate Duke.

18:23.853 --> 18:25.593
- What?

18:28.650 --> 18:30.936
- Audrey will help Mara

18:31.027 --> 18:33.643
realize the terrible mistake
she's making.

18:33.738 --> 18:37.322
- Audrey's gonna talk Mara
into stopping all this?

18:37.409 --> 18:38.615
- No.

18:38.702 --> 18:41.535
Mara's personality has been
overlaid so many times,

18:41.621 --> 18:44.863
I think the goodness
that is in Audrey

18:44.958 --> 18:47.324
has been leeched out of Mara.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.332
It must be returned.

18:51.423 --> 18:54.631
- What?
- Nathan, just listen to her, please.

18:54.718 --> 18:57.960
- Audrey must be returned to Mara.

18:58.972 --> 19:00.587
When they're recombined,

19:00.682 --> 19:03.549
I think Mara will choose
to stop all of this.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.599
- Audrey was trapped
in Mara before.

19:05.687 --> 19:08.144
- I'm not talking about
trapping Audrey in Mara.

19:08.231 --> 19:11.564
I'm talking about making
Audrey part of Mara.

19:11.651 --> 19:15.018
The part she lost.
The part that's good.

19:15.113 --> 19:17.695
I can do that.
- There's got to be another way.

19:17.782 --> 19:18.771
- There isn't.

19:18.867 --> 19:21.358
Audrey isn't sick
because they're both here.

19:21.453 --> 19:24.286
She's sick because
one life force split into two.

19:24.372 --> 19:26.158
This is our solution.

19:28.710 --> 19:29.916
- No.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.745
- If we don't do it
and Mara gets in that void...

19:34.299 --> 19:37.211
she will destroy all of us.

19:37.302 --> 19:39.418
- Hey, Mara.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.219
It's your old buddy,
Duke Crocker.

19:42.307 --> 19:43.968
Remember me?

19:46.478 --> 19:49.515
So I hear you're, uh,
looking for a thinny.

19:49.606 --> 19:51.722
Want to go into the void.

19:52.901 --> 19:56.519
Well... I'm your guy.

20:01.326 --> 20:04.238
- (sighs)
Don't be mad at me.

20:04.329 --> 20:06.945
I'm not giving up.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.281
I'm finishing.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.960
Do you remember
how all of this started?

20:15.382 --> 20:19.000
We found that picture of Lucy
and we thought that she was my mother.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.793
And then we finally find my mother

20:21.888 --> 20:23.799
and discover that I don't
even have one, so...

20:23.890 --> 20:25.505
- So what?

20:25.600 --> 20:28.262
Doesn't mean you don't
deserve to live.

20:28.353 --> 20:30.264
- No, it doesn't mean that.
- Then why do this?

20:30.355 --> 20:32.721
- Because it's what I want to do.

20:32.816 --> 20:36.559
Me. Audrey Parker.

20:38.446 --> 20:40.607
Do you love me?

20:42.409 --> 20:45.446
- Yes.
- Then let me do this.

20:45.537 --> 20:47.118
Let me save Haven.

20:47.205 --> 20:49.821
Let me save Duke
and let me save you.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.453
Please. Find Mara.

20:52.544 --> 20:55.035
Don't let her go through
a thinny and destroy us all.

20:55.130 --> 20:58.213
I will stay here.
I will help those kids.

20:58.299 --> 21:00.130
Please.

21:00.218 --> 21:03.335
Go and find her
so we can do this.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.026
- Fine.

21:20.113 --> 21:23.446
I'll find Mara.
- Yeah.

21:23.533 --> 21:26.320
- I'll let Charlotte combine you,

21:26.411 --> 21:29.244
but you have to promise me

21:29.330 --> 21:31.582
that you will keep fighting
to stay alive in there.

21:31.666 --> 21:34.578
- I don't know if I could do that.
- You can. You're strong.

21:34.669 --> 21:37.502
Promise that you will keep
fighting to save yourself, too.

21:37.589 --> 21:39.705
- Nathan.
- Promise me, Parker,

21:39.799 --> 21:41.835
because when this is done...

21:43.261 --> 21:45.547
I'm gonna get you back.

21:47.682 --> 21:49.468
- I promise.

21:54.522 --> 21:57.059
- When it's done,
I'm gonna get you back.

22:16.336 --> 22:18.497
- All right, here we go.

22:19.506 --> 22:21.337
(handcuffs clicking)

22:23.343 --> 22:25.584
(computer beeps)

22:27.013 --> 22:29.470
- (screaming, banging)

22:31.935 --> 22:33.641
- Help!

22:33.728 --> 22:35.764
Dwight: Sutherland, see if you can get
a compressor pumping air in there.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.891
Move! Move!

22:37.982 --> 22:40.815
- Dwight, I got some information.

22:40.902 --> 22:43.518
Here's a list of all the kids
trapped in the boat.

22:43.613 --> 22:46.571
This is the cops stuck
in the gun locker.

22:46.658 --> 22:48.694
Look at the last names.

22:48.785 --> 22:50.616
Him.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.285
- I'll be right back.
Don't let that boat go down!

23:05.134 --> 23:07.546
- (Duke scoffs)

23:09.889 --> 23:13.097
- I'm sorry, I needed to
see you chained up

23:13.184 --> 23:14.560
before I came here.

23:14.644 --> 23:17.681
I wanted to make sure that
you weren't going to jump me.

23:17.772 --> 23:20.309
At least, not in a bad way.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.516
- All right, I have to ask.

23:22.610 --> 23:26.523
Do you miss the toe?
- Not really, no.

23:26.614 --> 23:29.902
Strappy summer sandals are out.

23:29.993 --> 23:33.235
I let my pedicure
go to hell, anyway.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.618
- You know, it's ironic.

23:37.709 --> 23:40.621
When I had you chained up here...

23:41.921 --> 23:45.038
I didn't realize
you were holding all the cards.

23:45.133 --> 23:46.543
But now...

23:46.634 --> 23:49.501
- You hold all the cards now?

23:49.596 --> 23:52.463
- Oh, yeah. Full boat.

23:54.434 --> 23:57.016
I have what you want, Mara.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.469
- The location of an open thinny?

23:59.564 --> 24:03.432
- You can leave right now.
On one condition.

24:03.526 --> 24:06.484
- That I keep you from blowing your top?
- No.

24:06.571 --> 24:10.814
I want a guarantee that
I don't Trouble any more people.

24:10.908 --> 24:12.444
Ever.

24:12.535 --> 24:14.867
Now, I'm gonna get this
guarantee because, you see,

24:14.954 --> 24:17.195
you and I are gonna
take a little road trip together

24:17.290 --> 24:19.246
to this open thinny.

24:19.334 --> 24:22.121
I'll even tell you what state.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.076
North Carolina.

24:24.172 --> 24:28.211
But I'm not gonna tell you
exactly where it is until we are...

24:29.802 --> 24:31.053
right there.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.252
- Why?

24:32.347 --> 24:34.713
- Well, because that way,
you can't ditch me.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.718
And because...

24:38.311 --> 24:40.802
well, I want to go with you.

24:40.897 --> 24:42.728
- Through the thinny?

24:42.815 --> 24:44.897
- Through the thinny,
into the void,

24:44.984 --> 24:47.361
and over the woods
to Grandmother's house we go.

24:47.445 --> 24:50.312
- Why?

24:50.406 --> 24:54.365
- In case I blow, I do not want
to Trouble another person in Haven.

24:55.912 --> 24:59.621
This is the only way
I can guarantee what I want.

24:59.707 --> 25:03.666
So... what do you say?

25:05.588 --> 25:08.295
- I say...

25:10.635 --> 25:14.048
what are we waiting for?

25:15.932 --> 25:18.594
- (screaming, gasping)

25:18.685 --> 25:20.676
(sirens blaring)

25:24.565 --> 25:26.647
- Julia?!

25:26.734 --> 25:31.103
- Joe Sena, father of trapped cop
Alex Sena and Julia Sena on that boat.

25:31.197 --> 25:32.812
He's our Troubled guy.

25:32.907 --> 25:34.408
He said his family's
never been Troubled,

25:34.492 --> 25:36.323
but he was at The Gull
this morning with Duke.

25:36.411 --> 25:37.776
- And Duke's leaking Troubles.

25:37.870 --> 25:40.327
- I tried to talk Joe down
on the way here, but that's your thing.

25:40.415 --> 25:41.996
You got this.

25:42.083 --> 25:44.119
No pressure.
- Oh.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.371
- Dwight?
- Busy.

25:46.462 --> 25:49.295
- No, Dwight, please.

25:49.382 --> 25:51.668
- Okay, I just want to know one thing.

25:51.759 --> 25:53.465
All of that work we did--
the blood tests,

25:53.553 --> 25:55.885
the genetic marker--
was any of that real?

25:55.972 --> 25:58.429
- It was real.
It was all real.

25:58.516 --> 26:01.053
I was trying to figure out
what Mara had done.

26:01.144 --> 26:02.680
- Why should I believe you?

26:02.770 --> 26:04.806
- Because we were real.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.604
I care about you, Dwight.

26:07.692 --> 26:09.478
- Were you ever
planning on staying

26:09.569 --> 26:11.525
or did you always know
that some version of today

26:11.612 --> 26:13.739
was coming for me?

26:14.991 --> 26:17.027
- I always knew.

26:17.118 --> 26:19.404
- Well, in case
you were wondering...

26:20.621 --> 26:23.237
today really sucked.

26:24.584 --> 26:26.666
- Joe, listen to me.

26:26.753 --> 26:29.460
You're Troubled and you are
doing this to your kids.

26:29.547 --> 26:32.539
Now, we need to figure out
what emotion is bringing this out.

26:32.633 --> 26:34.498
Is there anything
that happened today?

26:34.594 --> 26:36.380
Anything traumatic?

26:36.471 --> 26:39.804
- I called Alex after that guy
exploded at The Grey Gull.

26:39.891 --> 26:41.347
I told him to be careful.

26:41.434 --> 26:43.345
I wanted him to come home,
but he wouldn't.

26:43.436 --> 26:47.020
Being a cop is dangerous enough,
but being a cop in Haven?

26:47.106 --> 26:48.971
And I hate that police station!

26:49.066 --> 26:50.681
- What about your daughter?

26:50.777 --> 26:53.439
Are you worried about her
and the kids she hangs out with?

26:53.529 --> 26:55.190
- I wanted to send her away to school,

26:55.281 --> 26:58.273
but she didn't want
to leave her classmates.

26:58.367 --> 27:00.949
Troubled classmates
who could kill her.

27:03.247 --> 27:05.829
- Joe, you fear for your children.

27:05.917 --> 27:07.248
- And who wouldn't in this town?

27:07.335 --> 27:09.371
- It's your Trouble
that's trapping them.

27:10.546 --> 27:14.380
And I think it's trapping them in the
places that you fear for them the most.

27:16.719 --> 27:18.835
- (gasping, panting, crying)

27:30.817 --> 27:34.526
- Whoa!
- What are you doing here?

27:34.612 --> 27:37.354
- Well, the cops told me to come
and check out Mr. M-80.

27:37.448 --> 27:38.688
It was terrible.

27:38.783 --> 27:40.273
- And that's evidence?

27:40.368 --> 27:42.734
- No, um...

27:42.829 --> 27:44.194
Duke wanted to thank me.

27:44.288 --> 27:45.573
I did him a favor this morning,

27:45.665 --> 27:48.247
so he called and said
I could take his perishables.

27:48.334 --> 27:49.744
He's going out of town.

27:49.836 --> 27:50.996
- Where?
- I don't know.

27:51.087 --> 27:52.623
- Gloria, I need to find him.

27:52.713 --> 27:54.214
He's probably with--

27:54.298 --> 27:57.916
- Audrey? She was with him,
I saw her sitting in the car.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.843
- That wasn't Audrey.
Did they say anything?

28:00.930 --> 28:02.636
Do you have any idea
where they were going?

28:02.723 --> 28:05.806
- No, but I know
how they were going.

28:05.893 --> 28:08.384
- To save them,
to stop your Trouble,

28:08.479 --> 28:10.891
I think you need to stop
being afraid for them.

28:10.982 --> 28:13.223
- How? They're my kids.

28:13.317 --> 28:15.649
- (coughing)
- (cell phone vibrating)

28:18.030 --> 28:20.362
- Nathan?
- Duke is with Mara.

28:20.449 --> 28:22.986
They're leaving right now
in a seaplane.

28:23.077 --> 28:24.783
- What?
- I don't know what he's thinking.

28:24.871 --> 28:26.736
- (coughing)

28:26.831 --> 28:29.698
- You're getting worse.
- Yeah, I am.

28:29.792 --> 28:32.204
- Doing this is our only chance
to save you.

28:32.295 --> 28:34.502
Look, the plane is at Willow Cove.

28:34.589 --> 28:36.170
You're close.
Get over there.

28:36.257 --> 28:39.044
I'll be there as soon as I can.
- Okay, me, too.

28:42.138 --> 28:45.050
Joe, I know you're afraid

28:45.141 --> 28:47.678
and I know you want
to save your children,

28:47.768 --> 28:50.851
but I need you to stop
thinking about that right now.

28:50.938 --> 28:53.054
- Well, what the hell
am I supposed to think about?

28:53.149 --> 28:55.982
- Think about how much
you love them.

28:56.068 --> 28:59.151
- What?
- Just do whatever you can to keep--

28:59.238 --> 29:01.820
to keep that in your mind,
to think about that.

29:01.908 --> 29:03.489
Trust me.

29:03.576 --> 29:05.237
(shivering)

29:09.582 --> 29:12.198
- Julia? It's Daddy.

29:12.293 --> 29:14.124
Can you hear me?

29:16.088 --> 29:17.419
- Yes.

29:17.506 --> 29:20.168
Daddy? Daddy!

29:20.259 --> 29:22.796
- Hi, sweetheart!
- Hi, Daddy!

29:22.887 --> 29:25.344
Audrey: Don't be afraid for her, Joe.

29:25.431 --> 29:28.764
If you want to save her,
you have to stop being afraid.

29:30.603 --> 29:33.891
- Julia, I love hearing your voice.

29:33.981 --> 29:35.596
Do you know why, baby?

29:35.691 --> 29:38.433
Because it reminds me--

29:38.527 --> 29:43.112
it reminds me
that you're kind

29:43.199 --> 29:45.235
and smart

29:45.326 --> 29:48.944
and that I love you very much!
- Daddy.

29:50.122 --> 29:53.785
- And I know you're gonna be okay.

29:57.922 --> 29:59.537
(chains rattling)

29:59.632 --> 30:02.339
- (gasping)

30:09.892 --> 30:12.679
- Oh, Daddy!
- Oh, Julia!

30:12.770 --> 30:16.103
- Yeah.
- Armory door is open, boys are fine.

30:16.190 --> 30:18.681
Good job.

30:18.776 --> 30:20.641
Okay, now I have to find the girl
with the exploding touch.

30:20.736 --> 30:22.601
She has a cousin
just outside of town.

30:22.697 --> 30:24.187
You want to help me
get these guys to the hospital?

30:24.281 --> 30:26.533
- I can't.
I got to go find Nathan.

30:26.617 --> 30:29.359
Good-bye, Dwight.
(coughing)

30:34.041 --> 30:36.703
- All right.

30:36.794 --> 30:40.252
I'll check the forecast just in case,
but we should be good to go.

30:40.339 --> 30:42.830
- I didn't know that you had
your pilot's license.

30:42.925 --> 30:44.711
-ldon%.

30:44.802 --> 30:46.793
- I kind of love you,
Duke Crocker.

30:46.887 --> 30:49.344
- Yeah, you got a strange way
of showing it.

30:49.432 --> 30:52.549
- Yeah, well sometimes
that's a good thing.

30:52.643 --> 30:54.383
Dave: I'm telling you, Vincent,

30:57.314 --> 30:58.929
they were from here.

30:59.025 --> 31:00.936
- You don't know that.
- I do.

31:01.027 --> 31:02.858
And if on the other side
of this bush

31:02.945 --> 31:04.901
we see a huge, uprooted,

31:04.989 --> 31:06.945
trembling aspen,
we keep going.

31:07.033 --> 31:08.443
Deal?

31:12.371 --> 31:15.955
- Oh, my... you were right, Dave.

31:16.042 --> 31:19.534
Come on.
Don't lose your nerve now.

31:26.260 --> 31:28.216
- We should wait for Nathan.

31:28.304 --> 31:29.760
- Why?

31:29.847 --> 31:33.339
You want to say good-bye.

31:33.434 --> 31:35.641
- You said that when we combine,

31:35.728 --> 31:38.936
I won't be inside Mara,

31:39.023 --> 31:41.935
I will be a part of Mara.

31:42.026 --> 31:43.391
- Yes.

31:43.486 --> 31:46.398
Imagine a drop of white paint

31:46.489 --> 31:48.696
being mixed and swirled

31:48.783 --> 31:51.570
into a can of black paint.

31:51.660 --> 31:54.242
Gone, but still inside.

31:55.873 --> 31:58.239
- So then, Audrey Parker...

31:59.877 --> 32:01.663
will cease to exist?

32:01.754 --> 32:05.042
WiII-- will die?

32:05.132 --> 32:07.874
- Yes, she must.

32:07.968 --> 32:09.924
(gun cocks)
Mara: Damn straight.

32:18.104 --> 32:20.971
- Mara. Hi, dove.

32:23.776 --> 32:26.438
Every time I see you,

32:26.529 --> 32:28.485
you make me uneasy.

32:28.572 --> 32:30.278
I get creeped out.

32:30.366 --> 32:34.029
Like I've forgotten
something important.

32:34.120 --> 32:37.612
- And every time I see you...

32:38.833 --> 32:40.949
it makes me want to vomit.

32:41.043 --> 32:42.453
- (chuckles)

32:44.672 --> 32:46.128
(grunting)

32:48.175 --> 32:50.461
- Now, Mommy,

32:50.553 --> 32:52.339
Ilh ill?

32:52.429 --> 32:54.920
500 years and "hi"?

32:55.015 --> 32:56.425
- Put the gun down.

32:56.517 --> 32:58.508
You don't want to shoot me.
- I do.

32:58.602 --> 33:03.016
- Mara, I've had time to think.

33:03.107 --> 33:04.563
- Yeah.

33:04.650 --> 33:08.893
- And I might know
why you're so upset.

33:08.988 --> 33:12.355
- Maybe because you locked me
in this place for 500 years

33:12.449 --> 33:14.235
while other people
took over my body?

33:14.326 --> 33:15.827
- No..-

33:15.911 --> 33:17.947
because you blame yourself

33:18.038 --> 33:20.120
for what happened to Dad.

33:20.207 --> 33:24.325
Because I was too busy
trying to help you, not him...

33:25.671 --> 33:27.172
and we lost him.

33:27.256 --> 33:29.713
- (laughs) No!

33:30.759 --> 33:32.795
I blame you.

33:32.887 --> 33:36.220
You're timid and stupid
and jealous of the things I can do.

33:36.307 --> 33:37.763
And weak!

33:37.850 --> 33:41.092
And guess what?
I'm not.

33:41.187 --> 33:43.769
And I am going to get Dad back.

33:43.856 --> 33:47.189
- At what cost?
- Doesn't matter.

33:47.276 --> 33:48.561
- Does Duke matter?

33:50.988 --> 33:52.694
- I needed to work with the Aether.

33:52.781 --> 33:55.318
You may be afraid of it,
but I'm not.

33:55.409 --> 33:58.947
And as for Duke,
he'll be fine.

33:59.038 --> 34:00.744
I turned his thing off

34:00.831 --> 34:03.618
and we're gonna go flying.

34:03.709 --> 34:07.497
And maybe I'll turn
another little part on.

34:07.588 --> 34:10.295
- Mara, this whole situation

34:10.382 --> 34:12.919
has turned you
into something you're not

34:13.010 --> 34:14.671
and it's my fault.

34:14.762 --> 34:17.424
I beg you, please,

34:17.514 --> 34:19.095
let me help you.

34:19.183 --> 34:20.969
Let me make you whole again.

34:22.853 --> 34:24.764
- I don't want her.

34:24.855 --> 34:28.063
- She's not "her," dove,
she's you.

34:28.150 --> 34:31.517
You have to admit,
there are parts of her that you respect.

34:31.612 --> 34:33.568
Parts that could make you better.

34:33.656 --> 34:36.318
Let me return them to you.

34:42.998 --> 34:44.909
- Nathan.

34:49.255 --> 34:50.961
- I need Mara.

34:51.048 --> 34:53.004
- Yeah? So do I.

34:55.761 --> 34:57.467
Good-bye, Nathan.

34:57.554 --> 34:59.169
- Stop--
- I don't have time for this.

34:59.265 --> 35:02.723
- Duke, Mara turned you into
some kind of Trouble bomb and she--

35:02.810 --> 35:05.222
- I know.

35:05.312 --> 35:08.679
That's why I'm taking her
to a thinny, an open one.

35:08.774 --> 35:11.516
- What?
You can't let her through a thinny--

35:11.610 --> 35:13.111
- I won't.

35:13.195 --> 35:15.937
I'm gonna kill her

35:16.031 --> 35:18.022
right on the damn doorstep.

35:18.117 --> 35:20.073
- What?

35:20.160 --> 35:22.867
- I need Mara to go with me
to make sure that it is open,

35:22.955 --> 35:24.616
so...

35:24.707 --> 35:28.620
(scoffs)
so that I can go through.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.869
So that way,
I can explode

35:31.964 --> 35:35.172
inside the void

35:35.259 --> 35:37.375
so that I don't kill anyone else
with my Trouble.

35:37.469 --> 35:40.006
That is why I need Mara.

35:40.097 --> 35:42.930
So why do you need her?

35:43.017 --> 35:46.054
- To save you.
To save this town.

35:46.145 --> 35:49.387
- To save Audrey?

35:49.481 --> 35:51.597
Are you sure you can do that?

35:51.692 --> 35:53.478
- Yes.

35:53.569 --> 35:55.901
- It doesn't have to be this way.

35:55.988 --> 35:58.104
You don't have to be so angry.

35:58.198 --> 36:00.530
Do you like feeling like that?

36:01.618 --> 36:03.324
- No.

36:03.412 --> 36:07.496
I just feel like this all the time.

36:07.583 --> 36:10.495
- I am so sorry.

36:18.177 --> 36:20.042
- Do you remember
when I was little

36:20.137 --> 36:22.594
and we used to go swimming?

36:22.681 --> 36:25.218
With Dad?

36:25.309 --> 36:27.095
- Yeah.

36:30.564 --> 36:32.520
loved that.

36:34.568 --> 36:37.275
He would hold me in the water

36:37.363 --> 36:40.730
and I felt... safe.

36:40.824 --> 36:43.315
- And you don't feel safe anymore.

36:43.410 --> 36:45.446
- No.

36:45.537 --> 36:47.402
- And you need to feel
that way again,

36:47.498 --> 36:49.363
don't you?

36:52.294 --> 36:54.250
-ldo.

36:54.338 --> 36:56.920
- Let me help you, Mara.

36:57.007 --> 36:59.589
Please.

36:59.676 --> 37:01.541
Let me make you feel better.

37:03.180 --> 37:07.014
Let me give you
the part of you that you lost.

37:11.563 --> 37:14.475
- You just don't give up, do you?

37:14.566 --> 37:16.102
- No.

37:16.193 --> 37:18.684
- And you think that's a good thing?
- Isn't it?

37:18.779 --> 37:21.361
I don't want to lose you, too, Duke.

37:21.448 --> 37:23.154
- Thank you, that's very sweet.

37:23.242 --> 37:26.484
- If we let Audrey and Mara combine,
then maybe--

37:26.578 --> 37:28.239
- Then we have no idea
what will happen!

37:28.330 --> 37:30.412
Do we?

37:30.499 --> 37:32.490
(wind gusting)

37:37.089 --> 37:39.455
Nathan: What the hell is this?

37:39.550 --> 37:41.086
- It's more than wind.

37:41.176 --> 37:43.428
Come on!

37:46.473 --> 37:48.088
Nathan: Audrey!

38:20.340 --> 38:22.331
- Mara.

38:27.848 --> 38:29.804
- It's me.

38:31.727 --> 38:34.264
- Audrey?

38:34.354 --> 38:36.515
- Parker.

38:37.733 --> 38:40.224
- How?

38:40.319 --> 38:44.608
- Mara was already destroyed
by the loss of her father.

38:44.698 --> 38:47.155
I've been trying
to rescue her from that tragedy,

38:47.242 --> 38:50.905
but today I realized I was just

38:50.996 --> 38:53.612
torturing her instead.

38:53.707 --> 38:56.198
- So you changed--

38:56.293 --> 38:59.330
you changed your daughter?

38:59.421 --> 39:01.787
- I prefer to think of it as--
as rescued.

39:01.882 --> 39:05.591
Audrey was how Mara once was,

39:05.677 --> 39:08.760
the daughter I loved.

39:11.350 --> 39:14.808
- Parker...
- Yes, yes.

39:14.895 --> 39:17.762
It's me, Nathan.

39:25.072 --> 39:28.064
- Uh, hello?

39:28.158 --> 39:30.319
So what the hell
happens to me now?

39:30.410 --> 39:33.322
- Mara really did like you, Duke.

39:33.413 --> 39:37.531
She said that you two
were going on a trip

39:37.626 --> 39:41.289
and she said she turned you off.

39:41.380 --> 39:43.962
You should be okay.
- (sighs)

39:44.049 --> 39:46.335
Just a tip--

39:46.426 --> 39:48.758
next time, just, you know,
skip to the-- the good part.

39:50.514 --> 39:52.755
- I can feel you again, Parker.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.553
- Good.

40:00.399 --> 40:02.390
Duke: What?

40:04.444 --> 40:06.400
- What is that?

40:06.488 --> 40:08.695
Audrey: I don't know.

40:08.782 --> 40:10.773
Did you do that?

40:10.867 --> 40:14.735
- No. No, I have no idea
what that is.

40:14.830 --> 40:17.116
- I don't see anything.

40:17.207 --> 40:18.743
- It's right there.

40:18.834 --> 40:20.825
- I mean, In

40:20.919 --> 40:24.161
I can't see.

40:24.256 --> 40:27.043
- Oh, my--
Charlotte: I don't understand.

40:27.134 --> 40:29.796
Mara said that she
turned you off before your trip.

40:29.886 --> 40:32.377
- Mara also said that Duke
would explode if she died.

40:32.472 --> 40:34.679
Mara really died, didn't she?

40:34.766 --> 40:37.098
- Yeah, but I didn't think
this would happen.

40:50.365 --> 40:52.572
Dwight: What the hell?

41:05.839 --> 41:07.204
- Vincent.
- What?

41:07.299 --> 41:10.132
- I saw this rock in my vision!

41:13.138 --> 41:15.299
- And look!

41:17.601 --> 41:19.717
"Croatoan."

41:21.647 --> 41:23.683
This dust is dry.

41:24.983 --> 41:28.692
That was carved
with this rock

41:28.779 --> 41:30.360
today.

41:34.326 --> 41:36.066
- We should get out of here.

41:39.873 --> 41:42.364
What in blazes is that?

41:46.755 --> 41:48.370
- (panting)

41:48.465 --> 41:49.796
Audrey: Duke?

41:49.883 --> 41:52.499
Nathan: Duke, what's happening?

41:52.594 --> 41:54.585
Duke!

41:56.348 --> 41:57.884
(Duke grunting)

42:28.088 --> 42:29.794
- Ow.

42:29.881 --> 42:31.963
- (grunts)

42:32.050 --> 42:34.041
- (yelling)

42:36.888 --> 42:38.879
- (clamoring)

42:44.229 --> 42:46.140
