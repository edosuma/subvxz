00:05.839 --> 00:08.115
The Russians know Airwolf wasn't destroyed.

00:08.175 --> 00:09.518
You guys better watch yourselves.

00:09.576 --> 00:11.522
I don't want them getting
either you or that ship.

00:11.578 --> 00:14.320
There is a double agent in the Firm.

00:16.850 --> 00:19.023
He's been declared a Mad Dog.

00:20.687 --> 00:21.825
Hang on!

00:23.857 --> 00:26.337
We got a compressor stall.

01:39.967 --> 01:44.712
“Comrade Qaddafi claimed
the secret helicopter was”

01:45.806 --> 01:47.513
“destroyed”

01:48.075 --> 01:51.420
“by his air defenses
while attempting to escape”

01:52.079 --> 01:54.616
“to an American carrier in the Mediterranean.”

01:55.816 --> 01:58.660
“Although our trailing submarines determined”

01:58.986 --> 02:02.024
“that no rendezvous with the carrier occurred,”

02:02.155 --> 02:06.968
“we cannot definitely conclude
the helicopter was destroyed,”

02:08.127 --> 02:11.337
“since Comrade Qaddafi produced”

02:12.299 --> 02:16.270
“no physical evidence despite our requests.”

02:17.304 --> 02:19.511
“January 30, 1984.”

02:20.574 --> 02:22.110
Which nobody can deny

02:23.243 --> 02:24.688
For they are jolly good fellows

02:24.745 --> 02:26.554
For they are jolly good fellows

02:26.613 --> 02:29.321
For they are jolly good fellows

02:29.616 --> 02:31.459
Which nobody can deny

02:31.518 --> 02:35.193
Which nobody can deny
Which nobody can deny

02:35.288 --> 02:38.963
For we are jolly good fellows
For we are jolly good fellows

02:39.026 --> 02:42.564
For we are jolly good fellows

02:42.696 --> 02:44.972
Which nobody can deny

02:45.165 --> 02:48.203
Hey Larry, congratulations, pal!

02:48.268 --> 02:49.679
Thanks, guys.

02:49.736 --> 02:50.840
What do you think about this?

02:53.306 --> 02:56.651
Larry, the gang wants to say goodbye.

02:57.911 --> 03:01.449
Joe, the Russians know too soon, too quick.

03:02.516 --> 03:05.019
They know what Airwolf does
as soon as it does it.

03:05.085 --> 03:07.031
They may even know about Hawke.

03:08.422 --> 03:11.562
Larry, we're retiring today.

03:12.659 --> 03:15.765
They pay till 5:30, they get till 5:30.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.535
How's your heart, Mr. Klein?

03:21.902 --> 03:23.506
Blood pressure pills?

03:26.106 --> 03:27.483
Cheap Champagne?

03:28.208 --> 03:30.484
Not so cheap. They like us.

03:32.379 --> 03:35.258
Come on, join the party.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.160
All right, just let me finish this up.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.460
Joe, Joe, can we take this…

03:46.893 --> 03:48.839
Yeah, come on, let's go!

03:51.431 --> 03:54.935
“Although its mission was to”

03:55.335 --> 03:57.645
“sterilize the island,”

03:59.339 --> 04:02.980
“the helicopter used weapons systems”

04:03.577 --> 04:05.989
“known to exist on the secret machine”

04:06.046 --> 04:08.424
“Comrade Qaddafi reported destroyed.”

04:09.249 --> 04:11.991
“The machine appears, however,”

04:12.786 --> 04:15.323
“to be in the possession of”

04:16.822 --> 04:20.327
“a civilian or non-military organization.”

04:22.429 --> 04:25.433
“September 9, ‘84"

04:26.933 --> 04:28.344
I'll be a son of a gun.

04:33.473 --> 04:34.508
Mr. Barnes?

04:34.574 --> 04:36.645
Mason? I thought you all had retired.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.348
Not yet. Tonight's my last night.

04:38.411 --> 04:40.152
Well, good luck. You deserve it.

04:40.213 --> 04:41.886
Do you have a minute?

04:42.249 --> 04:43.250
Is it important?

04:43.316 --> 04:45.125
Well, it's that Airwolf business.

04:45.185 --> 04:47.358
Oh, I thought you'd finished with that.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.957
No. It's all there, Mr. Barnes.

04:50.023 --> 04:51.525
I know I didn't give you enough the last time,

04:51.591 --> 04:53.298
but now we have the proof.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.567
Look at these reports. See the dates?

05:03.937 --> 05:05.644
Well, I'll be.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.750
There'll be a commendation
in your file for this.

05:10.076 --> 05:11.282
I'm retiring, remember?

05:11.344 --> 05:12.721
That's our loss.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.816
We could use more like
you, Larry. I mean that.

05:15.882 --> 05:17.589
- Thank you, sir.
- Good night.

05:18.185 --> 05:19.323
Night.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.519
Dom, where's the percolator?

05:45.245 --> 05:46.349
The what?

05:46.413 --> 05:48.051
Thing looks like a coffee pot, you know?

05:48.114 --> 05:49.684
Oh, on the desk.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.992
Only be careful when you pick…

05:57.724 --> 06:00.295
I fixed up the infrared scanner on Airwolf.

06:00.360 --> 06:04.399
You fixed a $4 million,
top secret, advanced army,

06:04.464 --> 06:07.741
sensitive scanning device with
parts from a percolator?

06:07.834 --> 06:09.541
All I needed was a little hook.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.010
You told me it was gonna cost the Firm $4,000.

06:13.406 --> 06:15.886
Hey, that's why those big guys go broke.

06:15.942 --> 06:18.252
He's absolutely right, you know.

06:19.312 --> 06:21.485
Larry, how you been?

06:22.449 --> 06:24.895
Larry Mason, remember he
used to work for the Firm?

06:26.219 --> 06:29.200
You're the guy who gets all those
little bits and pieces of this and that

06:29.256 --> 06:30.963
from all around the world,

06:31.024 --> 06:34.562
and then puts them all together and
comes up with that important stuff.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.505
Past tense as of last night.

06:36.796 --> 06:39.640
I'm a gulf-front property owner in Mexico.

06:39.699 --> 06:40.734
Ta-da!

06:40.800 --> 06:43.007
Actually, it's only a coffee
counter and a couple of rowboats,

06:43.069 --> 06:44.480
but it's all ours, Joe's and mine.

06:44.537 --> 06:46.278
Hey, we're having dinner at the Pub tonight,

06:46.339 --> 06:49.252
Joe and his wife. Maybe you
could come along, both of you.

06:49.309 --> 06:52.483
They're great people. I'll show
you pictures of the place.

06:54.180 --> 06:56.251
Hey Hawke, do you have a minute?

06:57.717 --> 06:59.060
Oh, I can leave.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.793
Listen, if it's about business, Dom can hear.

07:04.758 --> 07:05.759
Have…

07:06.559 --> 07:08.835
have you ever had this place swept?

07:08.895 --> 07:10.533
For bugs, I mean?

07:11.164 --> 07:13.770
Well, what's so secret about
the fact that I'm in hock?

07:13.833 --> 07:14.868
Good.

07:20.006 --> 07:21.007
Guys.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.778
The Russians know Airwolf wasn't destroyed.

07:27.213 --> 07:29.716
Question: How do they know?

07:32.018 --> 07:34.658
Maybe the same way that you pick up stuff.

07:34.821 --> 07:37.131
No, no, no, no, no. I…

07:37.190 --> 07:40.501
I intercept messages from embassies,

07:40.560 --> 07:42.562
from agents. Theirs, not ours.

07:43.063 --> 07:46.237
I pick up threads. I pick up hints.

07:46.533 --> 07:49.013
It takes me months, sometimes years.

07:49.102 --> 07:51.173
They do it in days.

07:51.237 --> 07:54.810
Sometimes hours. They know exactly
what you've done with Airwolf.

07:55.408 --> 07:56.614
They try to cover it.

07:56.676 --> 07:59.520
They make it look like
it's gathered intelligence.

07:59.746 --> 08:03.250
But the time of discovery
is too close to the event.

08:04.684 --> 08:05.788
Moles, huh?

08:05.852 --> 08:07.024
Oh, brother!

08:07.654 --> 08:09.600
Then he has to be in the Firm.

08:09.889 --> 08:11.732
Not just in, near the top.

08:12.225 --> 08:14.068
Maybe even on the Committee.

08:15.462 --> 08:17.999
The British had one, the French did.

08:20.533 --> 08:22.444
You told this to the Committee?

08:22.502 --> 08:25.039
Too risky, I told Security.

08:25.772 --> 08:27.274
You guys better watch yourselves.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.514
I mean, I don't want them getting
either you or that ship.

08:30.777 --> 08:32.120
Hey, I gotta hustle.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.054
Hey Larry, just a second.

08:35.414 --> 08:37.587
I'm late for a meeting
at Records and Grievances.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.390
Listen, I'll talk to you at dinner tonight.

08:39.452 --> 08:41.432
7:00, the Pub, okay?

08:42.188 --> 08:43.292
Okay.

08:48.094 --> 08:49.471
Just cut that damn check.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.270
It's not that simple.

08:51.331 --> 08:52.867
Don't you understand?

08:53.500 --> 08:56.777
If we don't bring the checks to
their lawyers by 5:30 today,

08:57.170 --> 08:58.444
we blow the deal.

08:58.505 --> 09:01.679
Apparently, the computer is
still rejecting your request.

09:03.343 --> 09:06.756
I'm telling you, we've been
planning this for years.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.659
Joe, come on. We'll get it done. Right?

09:10.884 --> 09:13.364
I can't take this, the humiliation.

09:14.354 --> 09:17.335
After all this time, we're begging.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.304
I can't take this.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.034
My pills.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.631
Can't you do something?

09:24.864 --> 09:28.471
The problem is, temporary employees
are not due retirement bonuses.

09:29.169 --> 09:33.276
We're not temporary! You
call 20 years temporary?

09:33.339 --> 09:35.216
The computer… is wrong!

09:35.708 --> 09:38.814
Joe, sit down. You don't look well.

09:38.878 --> 09:40.653
That's it! That's it!

09:41.915 --> 09:46.125
No more excuses. I want my
retirement bonus check now!

09:46.553 --> 09:48.829
In black and white. Here. This minute.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.201
Not tomorrow. Not next week.

09:51.257 --> 09:55.228
No stalls. No delays. No more! Give it!

10:01.901 --> 10:04.404
Call a Doctor. Call a Doctor!

10:06.039 --> 10:09.213
Joe? Joe. Joe. Joey! Joey!

10:09.275 --> 10:11.152
It's an emergency.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.315
Send the paramedics.

10:12.378 --> 10:14.824
Joe! Come on, Joey! Come on, Joey!

10:17.450 --> 10:20.522
Come on, Joe! Joey! Come on, Joe!

10:20.720 --> 10:22.529
- Come on! Come on, Joe!
- Mr. Klein, he's dead.

10:22.589 --> 10:24.728
He's Klein and I'm Mason!

10:24.791 --> 10:26.737
Don't you even know who we are?

10:28.027 --> 10:29.802
Come on, Joe! Joe, come on!

10:29.863 --> 10:32.673
I can't do it all alone.
I can't run it alone. Joe!

10:32.999 --> 10:34.273
Mr. Mason…

10:34.334 --> 10:37.338
Joey, come on! Oh, Joe, come on!

10:37.403 --> 10:39.041
Get up, Joey!

10:39.105 --> 10:40.641
Joe!

12:24.143 --> 12:25.713
Wait’ll you see this one, Joe.

13:01.648 --> 13:03.127
I don't believe it.

13:03.182 --> 13:05.822
Larry Mason sings the Star-Spangled Banner

13:05.885 --> 13:07.831
every morning before breakfast.

13:08.821 --> 13:11.165
Hawke, he phoned 2 hours ago.

13:11.424 --> 13:14.200
He said he was responsible
for last night's explosion.

13:14.260 --> 13:15.705
He wanted to talk to Archangel.

13:15.762 --> 13:17.833
I stalled. I said he wasn't here.

13:17.897 --> 13:20.741
He said he'd call back at noon
and he wanted you present.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.781
He wouldn't do anything crazy
like that unless he had a reason.

13:23.836 --> 13:27.010
He's got a reason, or at
least he thinks he does.

13:27.273 --> 13:28.718
His partner died of a heart attack

13:28.775 --> 13:31.813
while trying to make a
retirement claim at that office.

13:32.245 --> 13:34.020
Great.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.264
What's he doing here?

13:43.956 --> 13:46.300
Larry Mason wants him here.

13:46.959 --> 13:49.405
What's your tie-in with Mason, Hawke?

13:49.762 --> 13:50.900
We're friends.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.011
His profile said he was prompt.

13:56.636 --> 13:57.740
Mason?

13:57.804 --> 13:59.283
This is Larry Mason.

13:59.739 --> 14:02.151
Mason, I'm gonna put you on a speaker.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.951
I don't care what you do, just listen.

14:05.478 --> 14:06.513
Is Hawke there?

14:06.579 --> 14:08.320
Yeah Larry, this is Hawke.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.258
I hate to drag you into this, kid,

14:10.316 --> 14:12.887
but I think you'll convince them I'm serious.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.263
- I'll sure do my best.
- Okay.

14:15.321 --> 14:16.629
Take this down.

14:18.257 --> 14:19.463
To the Firm.

14:20.159 --> 14:22.935
The matter of the status of
Agents Klein and Mason

14:22.995 --> 14:27.273
is brought to your attention
for the 252nd and last time

14:27.333 --> 14:29.404
since 1958.

14:30.770 --> 14:34.513
To cut and process their
retirement bonus checks,

14:34.574 --> 14:36.144
and forthwith.

14:36.843 --> 14:39.756
Larry, I gotta tell you, they're
trying to trace your call.

14:39.812 --> 14:42.418
Don't sweat it. I got it covered.

14:46.419 --> 14:47.989
As I was saying,

14:48.054 --> 14:49.897
if these grievances are not resolved

14:49.956 --> 14:53.927
and a check not sent to Mrs.
Joseph Klein in the next 48 hours,

14:54.727 --> 14:59.039
I will make certain classified
data available to the press

14:59.432 --> 15:02.606
every day until you comply.

15:03.302 --> 15:05.339
Larry, this is Marella.

15:06.406 --> 15:09.046
How did you get your hands
on our new tracking scrambler?

15:09.108 --> 15:11.611
Didn't I find these plans

15:11.677 --> 15:15.352
in an old file that was rejected
by Development a few years ago.

15:15.848 --> 15:17.555
It cost me $10 to make.

15:18.317 --> 15:19.694
What did you pay?

15:20.853 --> 15:22.730
Mason, Arthur Barnes.

15:23.122 --> 15:27.662
I promise you that I will personally
look into your and Klein's grievances.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.503
Just come in, we can talk.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.207
I can, but he can't.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.308
Pay what you owe!

15:44.544 --> 15:45.887
Pay the man his money.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.686
It's not that simple.

15:48.214 --> 15:49.284
Why?

15:49.415 --> 15:53.830
Take it easy, Hawke. Mason and Klein
signed on as temporary personnel to OSI,

15:53.886 --> 15:57.231
but they didn't change their
status when the Firm absorbed OSI.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.666
Personnel can't just reclassify them.

15:59.725 --> 16:03.502
That would set a precedent that could
open The Firm to thousands of claims.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.634
To compound the problem that
temps don't get a pension,

16:05.698 --> 16:07.268
they also don't get a medical,

16:07.333 --> 16:10.007
which means they owe the Firm for
health services they obtained.

16:10.069 --> 16:12.845
It was deducted from their last checks.

16:12.905 --> 16:14.441
I don't believe this.

16:14.674 --> 16:18.850
Hawke, obviously he has a grievance,
and we can rectify it, in time.

16:19.612 --> 16:23.788
Although his reaction was a
little strong, to say the least.

16:24.517 --> 16:28.226
The man's friend died trying
to get back what he earned.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.096
I sympathize.

16:30.556 --> 16:33.696
But in addition to his act
of terrorism last night,

16:33.759 --> 16:37.002
I just heard him threaten to
release classified information.

16:37.063 --> 16:38.474
We can't allow that.

16:38.531 --> 16:39.737
Pay him the money.

16:39.799 --> 16:40.834
We will,

16:40.900 --> 16:43.608
but Barnes is right, it'll take a little time.

16:43.803 --> 16:45.612
Then give me a little time.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.750
I'll bring him in.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.945
That is not our prerogative.

16:50.877 --> 16:52.982
Then you take it to the Committee.

17:06.325 --> 17:09.169
I would like to allow Hawke
time to bring Mason in.

17:09.595 --> 17:11.040
I agree with that recommendation,

17:11.097 --> 17:13.167
except the Committee should recognize

17:13.232 --> 17:15.644
that once Stringfellow Hawke is involved,

17:16.002 --> 17:19.779
it could provoke interest from other
quarters, especially if he uses Airwolf.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.342
Well, I don't see any necessity
for that, do you Hawke?

17:22.407 --> 17:23.409
No.

17:23.709 --> 17:27.122
We can't have the other side
becoming interested in this.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.918
I understand that, sir.

17:29.015 --> 17:32.588
Very well. We'll give you
48 hours. After that…

17:34.453 --> 17:35.761
Thank you, sir.

19:01.540 --> 19:03.451
Okay, burn it in here, burn one in here.

19:03.509 --> 19:06.012
I got it, I got it. Throw it, throw it.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.893
- All right.
- I made some lunch. Anybody hungry?

19:10.950 --> 19:12.258
Good!

19:12.318 --> 19:13.922
All right, here. I'll keep a couple Cokes?

19:13.986 --> 19:15.056
Okay, let her rip!

19:15.121 --> 19:18.796
You know, Larry, you just can't go
around blowing up government buildings,

19:18.858 --> 19:21.304
no matter how justified you feel.

19:21.527 --> 19:24.770
I did that in the heat of the
moment. I won't do it again.

19:25.431 --> 19:26.808
I don't have to.

19:28.067 --> 19:31.378
I know where all the bodies
are buried. Literally.

19:33.739 --> 19:36.413
I can make it very embarrassing for the Firm.

19:38.010 --> 19:41.184
Well, that's another thing you can't do, Larry.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.152
Give away Firm secrets.

19:43.215 --> 19:45.923
Oh, nothing important. Just embarrassing stuff.

19:46.485 --> 19:49.728
I pulled what I need out of
the Firm computer last night.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.032
How in the hell did you do that?

19:52.358 --> 19:54.634
Do I ask you how you fly a helicopter?

19:55.861 --> 19:57.568
Hey Hawke, I'm flat broke.

19:57.930 --> 20:00.968
That retirement bonus is all I
have. It's all Joe's wife has.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.946
And if I have to embarrass
a few people to get it,

20:04.103 --> 20:05.377
so be it.

20:06.839 --> 20:07.840
Okay.

20:09.008 --> 20:12.182
But before you do anything,
will you talk with Archangel?

20:12.278 --> 20:13.416
One on one?

20:14.180 --> 20:16.217
He'll fix it, I promise.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.563
He's waiting on us right now.

20:24.457 --> 20:25.492
Okay.

20:33.632 --> 20:36.613
It's got pretty good pick up
for an old van like this.

20:36.669 --> 20:37.943
It's my one luxury.

20:38.003 --> 20:40.609
It has a custom double overhead cam engine.

20:40.673 --> 20:44.314
I found the plans in a Swedish hot
rod magazine a couple of years ago.

20:44.376 --> 20:47.550
You know Hawke, they ought to
fire all those hi-tech engineers

20:47.613 --> 20:50.116
and let the kids design the secret weapons.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.091
What's wrong?

20:58.157 --> 21:00.296
That's Henderson back there, Barnes' aide.

21:00.359 --> 21:01.565
Barnes' aide?

21:01.627 --> 21:03.265
Oh, I'm sure you're surprised.

21:03.329 --> 21:07.038
Hey Larry, I swear. The
Committee gave me 48 hours.

21:35.427 --> 21:36.735
You're going in circles.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.070
So are they.

22:00.886 --> 22:02.365
What are you doing?

22:02.588 --> 22:04.295
It's called preparation.

22:09.195 --> 22:13.610
The police shift should be
changing about right now.

22:40.326 --> 22:41.600
Where'd you learn that one?

22:41.660 --> 22:43.139
In a spy novel.

22:45.064 --> 22:46.168
Get out.

22:46.265 --> 22:49.405
Larry, I swear I didn't set you up.

22:49.635 --> 22:52.309
I don't know what you did, but I have to think.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.611
So get out.

23:42.021 --> 23:43.728
Get me the night editor.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.292
George.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.969
We just got our Emmy story.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.644
You were to stay out of it!

23:56.702 --> 24:01.412
Henderson was acting on his own. I
won't know why until I find him.

24:02.675 --> 24:07.124
Larry Mason was putting together
Airwolf reports from the other side.

24:07.212 --> 24:09.021
That can only lead to one conclusion.

24:09.081 --> 24:11.687
There is a double agent in the Firm.

24:11.817 --> 24:13.626
Why didn't you report that to the Committee?

24:13.686 --> 24:16.394
Because the mole could be on the Committee.

24:16.622 --> 24:17.965
And you think it's Henderson?

24:18.023 --> 24:19.434
I didn't say that.

24:19.858 --> 24:22.737
No, but that is what you're thinking.

24:23.929 --> 24:26.136
I think you better take a look at this.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.675
This alleged particular group

24:30.736 --> 24:33.307
of Latin freedom fighters in the Miami area

24:33.539 --> 24:37.988
was supplied with the latest in hand
weapons, explosives, and bulletproof vests.

24:38.177 --> 24:41.750
And they proceeded to use the equipment
against banks in the southeast,

24:41.814 --> 24:45.785
until they were finally stopped by a
special team acting outside the Firm.

24:46.385 --> 24:50.333
Stay tuned. My informant promises
more and better bulletins.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.194
Well, he did say he knew where the bodies were.

24:54.259 --> 24:56.102
The Committee is not gonna like this.

24:56.161 --> 24:58.368
Come on. That was nothing.

24:58.831 --> 25:01.437
Tell that to the Senate when
we go up for appropriations.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.036
I have to find him.

25:03.469 --> 25:06.109
Well, I've still got 36 hours to bring him in.

25:06.271 --> 25:08.012
37, to be exact.

25:08.307 --> 25:10.014
I'd rather hear him say that.

25:10.075 --> 25:12.783
No, this is getting out of hand.

25:12.878 --> 25:15.518
I have a responsibility and so do you, Michael.

25:15.581 --> 25:18.391
We can't let this continue
without taking action.

25:18.584 --> 25:20.325
What kind of action?

25:20.686 --> 25:23.257
That's up to the Committee to decide.

25:24.556 --> 25:25.557
Michael.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.998
He's right, Hawke. It is getting out of hand.

25:29.128 --> 25:31.972
Whatever his grievance, he's gone too far.

25:36.602 --> 25:38.878
If it'll make you feel better, hit it.

25:40.339 --> 25:41.340
Better?

25:41.640 --> 25:45.349
Yeah, a lot better. I think I broke my knuckle.

25:45.711 --> 25:49.591
Look, the only thing you can do is
wait for Larry to contact you again.

25:50.315 --> 25:53.159
You know, he thinks I set him up.

25:53.652 --> 25:55.029
He knows better.

25:55.421 --> 25:59.164
Just give him a little time to realize it.
He'll call, and you'll bring him in.

25:59.224 --> 26:02.034
Will you tell me what action
the Committee takes?

26:02.694 --> 26:05.368
Hawke, I could lose my job.

26:12.037 --> 26:15.109
Well, if it'll keep you from
busting any more knuckles.

26:15.808 --> 26:18.152
Thanks, Marella. I'll be at the hangar.

27:45.397 --> 27:48.674
Yeah, I see what you mean. And it
couldn't have started by itself.

27:49.835 --> 27:51.109
I'm sorry, Dom.

27:51.737 --> 27:52.875
You could have lost everything.

27:52.938 --> 27:54.679
Including you.

27:56.241 --> 27:57.720
That must be Larry.

28:05.284 --> 28:06.354
Larry?

28:06.418 --> 28:09.627
Oh, Hawke. He's gone too far.

28:10.155 --> 28:11.293
Marella?

28:11.356 --> 28:13.836
Turn on Channel 3. It's all over the news.

28:14.593 --> 28:16.266
I don't know what you are talking about.

28:16.328 --> 28:17.500
Larry Mason.

28:18.063 --> 28:19.872
He released a story that got
some of our people killed.

28:19.932 --> 28:22.037
Operating behind the Iron
Curtain. Our consulate

28:23.268 --> 28:25.578
has confirmed the official police findings,

28:25.637 --> 28:27.810
but refuses to comment on allegations

28:27.873 --> 28:31.013
regarding the victims
supposedly being US spies.

28:31.743 --> 28:33.620
The bodies have been identified as that of

28:33.679 --> 28:36.285
the Romanian Embassy chauffeur Anton Ramuczec

28:36.348 --> 28:37.850
and Irene Nakovsky.

28:37.916 --> 28:40.419
Evidently, the story,
as presented to us yesterday

28:40.485 --> 28:42.590
by an unknown source in the United States,

28:42.654 --> 28:44.895
was designed to expose these agents.

28:45.390 --> 28:48.030
Something this reporter could
not have known at the time.

28:48.093 --> 28:51.836
It looks as though someone deep inside
the international intelligence community

28:51.897 --> 28:53.774
has a great big ax to grind.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.603
Sources in New York confirm
that Communist leader…

29:06.878 --> 29:07.948
Santini Air.

29:08.013 --> 29:10.857
Hawke, I didn't put the finger
on those agents. I couldn't.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.122
Well Larry, I believe you.

29:12.184 --> 29:13.822
But don't you see, by staying out,

29:13.885 --> 29:16.331
that you're playing more into
the hands of whoever's doing it.

29:17.055 --> 29:18.261
Hawke, I'm scared.

29:18.323 --> 29:19.529
Then come in.

29:19.591 --> 29:20.934
Well, that's easy to say.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.095
- Larry…
- Look, I trust you Hawke,

29:23.161 --> 29:25.664
but I need some assurances
from the Committee.

29:25.731 --> 29:27.176
Give me a couple of hours, till 10:00.

29:27.399 --> 29:28.935
Okay, you can reach me at…

29:29.001 --> 29:31.345
Don't say it. Look, think
of a place we know about.

29:31.703 --> 29:34.513
You can contact me when
we know it's not bugged.

29:35.607 --> 29:38.019
How about that place we were gonna
have dinner at the other night?

29:38.610 --> 29:39.611
Okay.

29:44.283 --> 29:47.730
Gentlemen, you all have read
Security's report on Larry Mason,

29:47.953 --> 29:49.227
the former reader.

29:49.288 --> 29:50.961
Recent disclosures indicate

29:51.023 --> 29:52.934
that we should declare him a Mad Dog.

29:52.991 --> 29:56.495
All you can actually accuse him
of so far is bad judgment.

29:56.895 --> 29:59.239
Isn't he responsible for
that disaster in Europe?

29:59.298 --> 30:01.335
That hasn't been proven yet, sir.

30:01.867 --> 30:05.337
Gentlemen, this is becoming
wearisome for all of us.

30:05.404 --> 30:09.181
How many more dead before
we take action to stop him?

30:10.075 --> 30:13.079
All in favor of terminating Lawrence Mason…

30:13.612 --> 30:16.991
We must not terminate this
man until we question him.

30:17.416 --> 30:19.362
signify in the usual manner.

30:22.287 --> 30:23.459
Against?

30:52.517 --> 30:53.621
Excuse me.

30:54.486 --> 30:57.956
I'm Stringfellow Hawke. I wanted to
ask some questions about Larry Mason.

30:58.023 --> 30:59.832
I told you “No” on the phone.

30:59.991 --> 31:03.200
Miss Morgan, American agents are dying

31:03.562 --> 31:05.007
because of your broadcast.

31:05.063 --> 31:08.237
You hold it. Don't you lay
that kind of pressure on me.

31:08.567 --> 31:12.105
I had no idea when I broadcast
those items that people would die.

31:12.170 --> 31:13.547
I'm sorry that they did.

31:13.638 --> 31:16.812
But what I have and where I get
it is privileged information.

31:19.111 --> 31:22.854
Look, Mason swears he didn't
tip you to that last bulletin.

31:23.749 --> 31:26.958
All I need is a way to prove
that he's telling the truth.

31:28.053 --> 31:30.363
I don't know what I can do to help you.

31:30.555 --> 31:34.435
Could you give me the transcripts
that he sent you over the computer?

31:35.193 --> 31:37.469
Why not? They're no longer privileged.

31:42.067 --> 31:43.171
Thank you.

31:44.903 --> 31:48.214
If it's good, do I get the story?

31:50.742 --> 31:51.777
Why not?

32:22.073 --> 32:23.143
That bad?

32:23.208 --> 32:25.552
It's even worse than we first thought.

32:26.178 --> 32:29.489
At least a dozen of our top
people have been eliminated.

32:30.882 --> 32:32.793
I knew some of them.

32:32.884 --> 32:35.990
Nick, the chauffeur at the Embassy.

32:37.489 --> 32:39.059
He used to put on all these funny hats.

32:39.124 --> 32:41.297
We called him Nicko the Clown.

32:43.295 --> 32:46.799
And Irene, his Control,
she was expecting a baby.

32:47.532 --> 32:49.876
We were bringing her home this spring.

32:51.102 --> 32:52.740
It's not Larry's fault.

32:52.804 --> 32:55.944
It's over, Hawke. He's been declared a Mad Dog.

32:56.341 --> 32:57.752
You can't do that.

32:58.176 --> 32:59.780
He was hurt, he reacted.

32:59.845 --> 33:03.952
But he did not send in the story that's
responsible for killing those agents.

33:09.087 --> 33:10.464
Who invited him?

33:10.755 --> 33:11.756
I did.

33:11.957 --> 33:13.630
You know, I trusted you.

33:13.692 --> 33:15.194
I trust Marella.

33:15.260 --> 33:17.900
But no one else is to be
involved until Larry comes in.

33:17.963 --> 33:20.068
It isn't Michael's fault, Hawke.

33:20.131 --> 33:22.077
The Committee tied his hands.

33:22.133 --> 33:24.841
Hawke, Larry's time is running out.

33:25.570 --> 33:27.948
This is the only way we could go about it.

33:34.145 --> 33:35.215
What's that?

33:35.280 --> 33:38.818
These are Carling Morgan's
bulletins from Larry Mason.

33:39.718 --> 33:42.722
We've already questioned her.
She couldn't tell us anything.

33:42.787 --> 33:45.495
Well, that's the information
she got from Larry.

33:46.691 --> 33:49.695
This is the one that got your agents killed.

33:50.729 --> 33:53.437
He didn't send them, somebody else did.

33:53.798 --> 33:55.334
How do you know that?

33:55.467 --> 33:57.208
Well, look at it closely.

33:58.069 --> 34:01.346
We all thought Larry was a reader,
but he was also a writer.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.884
He wrote a report on everything he read.

34:03.942 --> 34:06.684
Now, writers develop a style.

34:06.945 --> 34:10.620
The words are the same, but the way they
put them together is entirely different.

34:10.681 --> 34:12.525
The same way that a musician

34:13.018 --> 34:16.226
doesn't play the same song
the same way as another.

34:17.088 --> 34:18.465
Mr. Barnes, you…

34:18.857 --> 34:20.097
You were the one that Larry reported to.

34:20.158 --> 34:22.159
You read all his reports.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.630
Look at the last page.

34:24.696 --> 34:26.697
You see there's a very large difference.

34:26.764 --> 34:29.245
He's right, the styles are very different.

34:31.335 --> 34:34.340
I was of the opinion that Larry Mason was,

34:34.406 --> 34:36.612
at the very least, a fool.

34:37.108 --> 34:40.920
It appears he may have been
an innocent dupe, as well.

34:44.248 --> 34:45.353
Mr. Hawke?

34:49.219 --> 34:51.291
- Hello?
- Hawke, it's Larry.

34:51.356 --> 34:52.357
Larry?

34:54.326 --> 34:56.465
Archangel's here to speak with you.

34:59.431 --> 35:02.537
Mason, we want to bring you in safely.

35:03.201 --> 35:04.475
Where are you?

35:04.903 --> 35:07.076
I'm in Mexico, Tampico.

35:07.806 --> 35:09.547
He's in Mexico, Tampico.

35:10.875 --> 35:14.220
There's an old airstrip
10 miles north of there.

35:15.580 --> 35:17.423
Los Hermanos.

35:17.816 --> 35:21.161
There's an old airstrip at Los Hermanos.
Can you get to it?

35:21.219 --> 35:22.425
I'll find it.

35:22.487 --> 35:23.557
Are you sure?

35:24.389 --> 35:25.925
I read about it once.

35:33.164 --> 35:34.541
I'll pick him up.

35:34.833 --> 35:38.906
It would look better to the Committee
if he turned himself in to Archangel.

35:39.838 --> 35:42.250
Don't worry, Hawke. We'll bring him home.

35:42.874 --> 35:43.978
Excuse me.

35:46.344 --> 35:47.584
Mr. Barnes,

35:49.114 --> 35:50.718
can I buy you a drink?

35:51.349 --> 35:53.351
I thought you didn't like me?

35:53.585 --> 35:54.893
I don't.

35:56.321 --> 35:59.359
But anybody big enough to admit they're wrong.

36:00.892 --> 36:01.962
Why not?

36:03.795 --> 36:05.365
I'll have a Scotch.

36:05.797 --> 36:07.174
Where's the john?

36:23.181 --> 36:24.251
Hello?

36:24.315 --> 36:25.419
It's Barnes.

36:26.084 --> 36:29.395
Archangel is picking Mason
up at a small airstrip

36:29.454 --> 36:32.298
in Los Hermanos, Mexico, just north of Tampico.

36:33.058 --> 36:34.867
I would estimate 6 hours.

36:35.226 --> 36:37.433
Do we have a capability in that area?

36:37.562 --> 36:40.372
We may have a pilot whose
services are for hire.

36:40.632 --> 36:41.906
Is he any good?

36:41.966 --> 36:44.469
By all accounts, yes.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.705
For all our sakes, he better be.

36:58.450 --> 37:00.828
Hey, come on, relax a little, will you?

37:01.086 --> 37:04.033
Larry's on his way home,
and in good hands, too.

37:04.355 --> 37:06.494
Dom, there's still something wrong.

37:06.758 --> 37:08.738
I don't know what it is,
but I've got a feeling.

37:08.793 --> 37:11.205
Oh, you proved your point
with those news reports.

37:11.262 --> 37:14.038
Take a little credit, man.
Take a little credit.

37:31.916 --> 37:32.917
Hello?

37:33.051 --> 37:34.530
Hello, Miss Morgan?

37:35.253 --> 37:37.961
I was wondering… this is Stringfellow Hawke…

37:38.022 --> 37:39.296
Yes, Mr. Hawke.

37:39.357 --> 37:41.394
if you might have something
further that you hadn't told me?

37:41.459 --> 37:42.995
No, only those.

37:43.061 --> 37:44.096
Did it help?

37:44.162 --> 37:45.732
Oh, it all helped very much.

37:45.797 --> 37:47.470
I'm very grateful.

37:47.799 --> 37:49.904
I just wondered if there was
any further reports, or…

37:49.968 --> 37:52.073
Well, I gave you everything I have.

37:52.137 --> 37:55.141
Okay, thank you. I'm
sorry to have bothered you.

37:55.206 --> 37:56.776
Oh Hawke, wait a minute.

37:56.841 --> 37:58.912
There was one thing, we changed a word.

37:58.977 --> 38:00.820
- What was that?
- On the broadcast,

38:00.879 --> 38:02.916
we said that the radio was
hidden behind the wardrobe.

38:02.981 --> 38:05.985
The original said "chifforobe",
but nobody knew what that meant.

38:06.050 --> 38:07.290
"Chifforobe"?

38:07.619 --> 38:08.893
I don't know what it is, either.

38:08.953 --> 38:11.661
Well, it's a Southern word
and it means wardrobe.

38:13.424 --> 38:14.494
Thank you.

38:21.399 --> 38:22.400
Hey, Dom!

38:30.708 --> 38:32.915
I'm sorry about what happened.

38:33.444 --> 38:34.684
We know that.

38:35.380 --> 38:38.554
I didn't release that story
that got those people killed.

38:39.150 --> 38:42.495
You know, I might have a
grievance, but I'm not a traitor.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.265
We know that, too.

38:46.624 --> 38:47.762
Who do you think released it?

38:47.826 --> 38:50.136
That we don't know. But we'll find out.

38:51.229 --> 38:52.867
Was it Henderson?

38:53.498 --> 38:55.000
There'd be no reason for him to do it.

38:55.066 --> 38:57.945
Once he exposed himself by going after you,

38:58.136 --> 39:01.276
he'd have no need to release
information through the press.

39:01.339 --> 39:04.843
Well, if it wasn't Henderson, you
have another mole in the Firm.

39:23.394 --> 39:24.668
Get anything?

39:24.729 --> 39:27.039
No, too far to reach them on the radio.

39:27.098 --> 39:29.100
What about long range radar?

39:30.301 --> 39:32.679
I got a DC-9 heading for Mexico City.

39:33.371 --> 39:36.318
A couple of private jobs
on the coast, but no Lear.

39:36.774 --> 39:38.310
No jets out of Nicaragua?

39:38.376 --> 39:39.411
Not yet.

39:39.477 --> 39:41.354
I figure that's how Barnes
will have to bring him down.

39:41.412 --> 39:45.292
Well, maybe he's gonna wait until they land
at Langley, try to knock him off there.

39:45.350 --> 39:46.829
Nah, no way!

39:47.352 --> 39:49.628
They'd have to do it over Mexico or the Gulf.

39:49.687 --> 39:51.257
Hey, hey, I got ‘em!

39:51.322 --> 39:53.427
There's a Lear climbing out over Mandezo.

39:53.491 --> 39:54.663
- Any MIGs?
- Nope.

39:54.726 --> 39:56.228
Just that DC-9.

39:56.594 --> 39:58.301
Hey, wait a minute. I got someth’n else.

39:58.363 --> 40:01.207
That's not a MIG. It's not even a jet.

40:24.522 --> 40:25.557
Hang on!

40:31.095 --> 40:32.438
What the hell?

40:32.497 --> 40:34.067
We had to bank so hard to avoid that fool,

40:34.132 --> 40:35.702
we got a compressor stall.

40:35.767 --> 40:36.871
Are we gonna crash?

40:36.935 --> 40:38.107
Not if I can help it.

41:07.532 --> 41:10.775
An unmarked plane, 50mm cannons in the wings,

41:10.835 --> 41:13.076
2.75 rockets in the belly.

41:13.137 --> 41:14.878
Well, that's encouraging.

41:15.406 --> 41:17.181
It's a P-51, we can outrun it.

41:17.241 --> 41:18.743
Not with one engine.

41:39.530 --> 41:41.305
I wonder why he hasn't shot us down already.

41:41.366 --> 41:43.744
Oh, you're just one bundle of optimism.

41:45.870 --> 41:48.441
He's trying to make it look like an accident.

41:58.383 --> 42:00.192
You're pulling away from him now.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.431
Now, he'll shoot us down.

43:04.248 --> 43:07.127
Are we absolutely certain there's no hope?

43:07.385 --> 43:08.830
They're hours overdue.

43:08.886 --> 43:12.095
Air Rescue found some wreckage
along their route over the Gulf.

43:12.156 --> 43:13.635
I feel responsible.

43:13.891 --> 43:16.963
Nonsense. You found Henderson, terminated him.

43:17.495 --> 43:20.374
But too late to save
Archangel, Marella, Mason.

43:21.866 --> 43:23.709
You can have my resignation.

43:24.435 --> 43:27.382
Perhaps after you explain
why a mercenary pilot

43:27.438 --> 43:30.510
in the employ of the Soviet Mission to Mexico

43:30.575 --> 43:33.215
tried to shoot Archangel down.

43:34.545 --> 43:35.819
Who said that?

43:41.853 --> 43:43.230
The pilot,

43:43.287 --> 43:45.858
after he bailed out and we picked him up.

43:55.266 --> 43:58.611
Well gentlemen, what can I say?

44:00.938 --> 44:04.511
It's been a long run for
someone in my position.

44:05.743 --> 44:09.486
I shall patiently await
the next prisoner exchange.

44:10.414 --> 44:13.054
We don't exchange what we terminate.

44:47.351 --> 44:49.456
I can't believe I'm gonna ride in her.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.227
Straight back to Mexico.

44:51.756 --> 44:53.758
The Committee made an exception.

44:53.891 --> 44:56.770
The Committee? Ha! We didn't
give ‘em any choice!

44:57.228 --> 44:58.366
What about Joe's wife?

44:58.429 --> 44:59.464
It's done.

44:59.530 --> 45:01.942
She gets his benefits and you get yours.

45:02.667 --> 45:04.544
The Committee also hinted they'd like you back

45:04.602 --> 45:07.105
as a Senior Advisor in the Reader Section.

45:08.272 --> 45:10.115
That's very nice of the Committee,

45:10.174 --> 45:12.814
but maybe I'll just go ahead with the marina.

45:13.477 --> 45:15.582
Joe might be disappointed if I didn't.

45:15.646 --> 45:17.182
You're turning us down?

45:17.248 --> 45:19.228
No, no, no, I didn't say that.

45:19.283 --> 45:20.694
More like…

45:22.386 --> 45:23.797
I'll let you know.

45:26.857 --> 45:28.803
Mach 2, Dom?

45:29.460 --> 45:31.406
82,000 feet?

45:33.331 --> 45:35.333
The fellow has gall.

45:36.167 --> 45:37.805
And don't you forget it,

45:38.102 --> 45:41.345
or I'll have to tell the press
about a little story that he…

45:41.405 --> 45:42.782
told on you to me.

45:42.840 --> 45:44.478
Me? What story?

46:02.493 --> 46:04.029
What's he talking about?

46:04.095 --> 46:05.699
I wouldn't know, sir.
