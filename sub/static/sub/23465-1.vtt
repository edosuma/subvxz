02:08.728 --> 02:10.794
No, no, no, bro! We're not here for you!
Don't even think about it!

02:10.795 --> 02:12.531
Don't you move,
motherfucker!

02:12.533 --> 02:14.902
Hands away from the weapon, bro!
Fucking relax!

02:17.504 --> 02:19.371
3170. We're being held up.

02:19.373 --> 02:22.407
Armor piercing rounds
are chambered in this firearm!

02:22.409 --> 02:25.377
Please don't be the asshole
who forces me to use them.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.513
Take your foot off the gas,

02:27.515 --> 02:30.747
press the unlock button,
and step out of the vehicle,

02:30.749 --> 02:32.716
or we will forcibly
remove you!

02:32.718 --> 02:36.022
Fucking do it! Now!

02:36.590 --> 02:38.392
Your choice! Go!

02:57.510 --> 02:59.077
What the fuck!

02:59.079 --> 03:01.111
He fucking went for his gun.

03:01.113 --> 03:03.283
He spilled his fucking coffee.

03:11.790 --> 03:13.091
Shit.

03:13.093 --> 03:14.094
Gardena, 30 seconds out.

03:14.894 --> 03:16.193
Copy.

03:16.195 --> 03:17.764
Thirty out. Hustle!

03:21.368 --> 03:22.869
- Pop it.
- Ready.

03:34.481 --> 03:35.580
Man on!

03:40.319 --> 03:41.786
Out of fucking time.

03:41.788 --> 03:43.455
Prepare to engage.

03:43.457 --> 03:44.989
Contact right!

03:44.991 --> 03:47.558
Range 100. Suppressive fire.

04:00.105 --> 04:01.239
Contact left!

04:02.742 --> 04:05.813
Dispatch, 10-97.
LAPD is on scene.

04:19.427 --> 04:20.628
We are under heavy fire!

04:42.782 --> 04:43.784
Fuck!

04:50.890 --> 04:52.058
Motherfucker!

05:00.866 --> 05:02.902
Whoa, whoa.
I got you. I got you.

05:19.919 --> 05:22.089
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

05:43.275 --> 05:44.741
What the fuck was that?

05:44.743 --> 05:46.210
Did you see him
go for his gun?

05:46.212 --> 05:49.417
I don't know.
I just saw Bosco lit him up.

05:55.921 --> 05:58.188
Take the second left
into the tunnel.

05:58.190 --> 06:00.094
Hug the airport.
Take the tunnel.

06:19.279 --> 06:20.777
Go right on Doty.

06:20.779 --> 06:21.981
<i>Right on Doty.</i>

07:30.183 --> 07:32.116
Make sure you take care
of those weapons.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.188
I don't want any
accidental discharges.

07:35.722 --> 07:37.955
- What are you looking at him for?
- Ray.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.222
I'm not talking to him.
I'm talking to you.

07:39.224 --> 07:40.528
What the fuck was that?

07:49.034 --> 07:50.401
What else
did you fuck up, huh?

07:52.337 --> 07:54.241
You sure you were clean
all the way home?

07:55.041 --> 07:56.243
Catch any tails?

08:03.650 --> 08:05.386
Where did Marcus
take those rounds?

08:08.555 --> 08:10.723
Femoral artery. He's done.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.562
Well, we knew the risks.

08:16.564 --> 08:18.566
Shit popped off.
We handled it. That's it.

08:25.837 --> 08:26.907
Hey, B.

08:28.073 --> 08:30.073
Get back over there.

08:30.075 --> 08:32.208
See who responded.
It was probably LASD.

08:32.211 --> 08:34.744
They'll supersede Gardena,

08:34.746 --> 08:37.251
but if it's Major Crimes,
we've got a problem.

08:44.592 --> 08:46.856
All clear? No GPS?

08:46.858 --> 08:48.928
It's one of the old models, man.
We good.

08:51.097 --> 08:52.765
We've got to
get this patched up.

08:53.367 --> 08:54.602
We need this clean.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.544
You good?

09:05.278 --> 09:06.947
We're cop killers now.

09:32.804 --> 09:34.408
Well, that looks
like it hurt.

09:36.074 --> 09:37.076
No?

09:38.810 --> 09:40.644
Good morning,
fellow officers.

09:40.646 --> 09:41.979
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

09:41.981 --> 09:43.080
Yeah?

09:43.082 --> 09:45.016
I take it he's a bad guy.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.816
You mean the guy
with the black body armor,

09:46.818 --> 09:48.819
shotgun, and gas mask?

09:48.821 --> 09:51.423
That's very funny.
We know who he is yet?

09:51.425 --> 09:52.426
Rough night?

09:53.025 --> 09:55.091
Yes. Next subject?

09:55.093 --> 09:56.926
You're not looking
so hot there, bubba.

09:56.928 --> 09:58.863
I think he
looks amazing.

09:58.865 --> 10:02.298
You better start downing the POM juice,
big man. We've got a piss test Friday.

10:02.300 --> 10:04.167
Thursday.

10:04.169 --> 10:06.370
What, like you Mormons have been
drinking wheatgrass all fucking month?

10:06.372 --> 10:07.838
Please.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.508
You got another one of those?
I'm fucking starving.

10:09.510 --> 10:11.042
Yeah, there's a
couple that don't have blood.

10:11.044 --> 10:14.778
I think it's one of the
pinkies with the sprinkles.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.946
- That's some real donut.
- Okay, what's the tally?

10:16.948 --> 10:18.482
Those are horrendous, dude.

10:18.484 --> 10:20.884
We've got four dead, six on
the way to the hospital.

10:20.886 --> 10:22.887
- But they'll be all right.
- Fuck.

10:22.889 --> 10:25.690
Ambushed them as they
were coming to get breakfast.

10:25.692 --> 10:27.359
Surrounded the truck.

10:27.361 --> 10:30.027
This poor fool right here was trying
to do what he gets paid to do.

10:30.029 --> 10:33.398
AP rounds blasted through
the windshield took him out.

10:33.400 --> 10:37.200
They took the truck, Gardena police
lost them under Hawthorne Municipal.

10:37.202 --> 10:38.570
They knew the route.

10:38.572 --> 10:41.539
Picked it because it was
next to Municipal Airport,

10:41.541 --> 10:45.044
knew the restricted air space
meant no ghetto bird air support.

10:46.712 --> 10:49.979
We're dealing with a different
animal here, boys.

10:49.981 --> 10:52.316
Talk to the armored car company?
What was the haul?

10:52.318 --> 10:54.884
They were en route to a bank
pickup for a Fed drop.

10:54.886 --> 10:55.888
But there was nothing
in the truck.

10:56.755 --> 10:57.924
Nothing in the truck?

11:00.326 --> 11:01.928
They stole a fucking
empty armored truck?

11:02.227 --> 11:03.528
Yup.

11:05.399 --> 11:07.399
Why the fireworks?

11:07.401 --> 11:10.270
One of the vics said the messenger went
for his gun. That's when it popped off.

11:11.405 --> 11:12.737
Genius.

11:12.739 --> 11:14.739
Okay, the SUV,
what have we got?

11:14.741 --> 11:16.508
That's a cold car.

11:16.510 --> 11:19.710
VIN's been pried off. Plates are stolen.
No prints on it.

11:19.712 --> 11:21.379
They bleach-bombed it.

11:21.381 --> 11:26.618
Right. Take it to SID. Tent that fucker.
Swab it. Detail it.

11:35.093 --> 11:38.395
Ah, fuck. I can't deal with
this retard factory this early.

11:38.397 --> 11:40.096
One of you guys handle it?

11:40.098 --> 11:41.233
It's all you, bro.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.268
Thank you.

11:44.270 --> 11:46.870
All right, witnesses,
donut shop guy?

11:46.872 --> 11:48.539
He saw them, and they
looked right at him,

11:48.541 --> 11:50.276
but, for some reason,
they left him alone.

11:53.613 --> 11:56.980
Okay, pull all video surveillance and
plate readers. Do a Palantir run.

11:56.982 --> 11:58.282
Talk to DOT, okay?

11:58.284 --> 12:01.552
Pull it all together,
and meet me at the office.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.458
And find me
that fucking truck.

12:06.992 --> 12:11.295
Big Nick, original gangsta
cop in the flesh.

12:11.297 --> 12:13.565
Lobbin' Bob. Huh?

12:13.567 --> 12:15.302
How's that
mean tennis game?

12:20.740 --> 12:22.306
Look at you, man.

12:22.308 --> 12:24.141
Where'd you pick that up?
Nice suit.

12:24.143 --> 12:27.511
Well, not where you're shopping.
I can't afford it.

12:27.513 --> 12:29.946
I mean, how does
a county sheriff

12:29.948 --> 12:32.649
pay for such a beautiful
piece of men's fashion?

12:32.651 --> 12:35.018
You kidding me? This piece of shit?
Nah, this is garbage.

12:35.020 --> 12:36.253
Look at you.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.288
This thing's tits!

12:38.290 --> 12:41.658
You must pull all kinds
of ass sporting that, no?

12:41.660 --> 12:43.760
Nick, you know what?
I can't. I can't.

12:43.762 --> 12:47.532
It's too early in the morning
for your fucking circus.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.834
You just threw
a donut in the hot zone.

12:49.836 --> 12:51.602
- No. I did not.
- Yeah, you did.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.671
I did?
That was fucking wrong.

12:53.673 --> 12:56.005
It was. I don't like you, Nick, or
how you handle police business...

12:56.007 --> 12:57.810
Hey, hey, hey.
What's up with that?

12:58.612 --> 13:00.176
I like you.

13:00.178 --> 13:02.345
Aside from the fact
that you're a vegetarian.

13:02.347 --> 13:04.849
Vegan! I'm a vegan.

13:04.851 --> 13:06.950
- Vegetarians, they eat milk...
- Yeah, sorry to hear that.

13:06.952 --> 13:09.018
What are you
doing here anyway, huh?

13:09.020 --> 13:12.726
No legal tender was stolen.
It isn't Federal.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.061
Yet.

13:17.129 --> 13:18.799
You're pausing
for dramatic effect?

13:22.702 --> 13:24.372
You're such a big,
bad lieutenant.

13:25.203 --> 13:27.303
- I know. I know.
- Yeah.

13:27.305 --> 13:30.042
Can I go now, Dad?
I'm kind of hungry.

13:37.049 --> 13:39.583
So Gardena showed up,
and they secured the scene,

13:39.585 --> 13:42.720
and then these clowns
took over.

13:42.722 --> 13:44.354
Who are they, LASD?

13:44.356 --> 13:47.224
Yeah, Sheriff's. They must be.
Look at this clown right here.

13:47.226 --> 13:48.496
He seemed to be in charge.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.442
You recognize him?

14:05.444 --> 14:07.611
He played football at South.

14:07.613 --> 14:10.584
Remember Endo?
Filipino dude the cops killed?

14:10.917 --> 14:12.349
Yeah.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.350
That's the cop
who blasted him.

14:14.352 --> 14:16.253
Runs Major Crimes.

14:16.255 --> 14:18.091
Get to know your enemy, boys.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.899
Who's running this crew?

14:29.901 --> 14:32.470
Probably two, three guys
that can pull this off, max.

14:32.472 --> 14:37.442
Why steal an armored truck
with nothing in it?

14:37.444 --> 14:39.610
Bad tip,
they probably botched it.

14:39.612 --> 14:41.077
Why didn't they dump it, then?

14:41.079 --> 14:43.247
- I'll check the salvage yards.
- All of them.

14:43.249 --> 14:47.485
And how'd they know about a transfer
from the casino to the Fed,

14:47.487 --> 14:51.821
especially one that wasn't scheduled
through the regular carrier? How?

14:51.823 --> 14:54.325
It was an inside job, bro.
It had to be.

14:54.327 --> 14:57.293
Oh, fuck.
Give me the Pepto.

14:57.295 --> 14:59.964
Okay, inside job, but where?

14:59.966 --> 15:03.803
Right? Was it the casino, the bank, the
Fed, the fucking donut shop? Where?

15:04.971 --> 15:06.406
What about Merrimen?

15:09.808 --> 15:11.475
When did he parole again?

15:11.477 --> 15:14.280
- Eight months ago.
- Eight months ago?

15:15.914 --> 15:18.816
We need to find
that fucking truck.

15:18.818 --> 15:20.850
Have we still got a tail
on that Wilson kid?

15:20.852 --> 15:22.186
Yeah.

15:22.188 --> 15:23.186
The one who was
hanging out with Merrimen?

15:23.188 --> 15:24.821
What bar did he work in?

15:24.823 --> 15:27.825
- Hofbrau.
- Ziggy's Hofbrau.

15:27.827 --> 15:29.162
Let's pay him a visit.

15:39.539 --> 15:42.676
...some Wi-Fi? No?
We better check his videos.

15:45.678 --> 15:46.846
- Thanks.
- All right.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.514
Wolfgang, talk to me.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.548
- Donnie, I'm tapped out.
- No problem.

15:51.550 --> 15:53.182
Put it on my tab, all right?

15:53.184 --> 15:54.784
- Of course, man, I got you.
- Thank you.

15:54.786 --> 15:56.021
Have a good night.

16:08.199 --> 16:09.298
Are we doing this?

16:09.300 --> 16:10.903
Yeah, man. All right, man.

16:11.703 --> 16:13.704
To money and women.

16:13.706 --> 16:14.908
That we don't have.

16:18.377 --> 16:20.744
How do you remember
everybody's order like that?

16:20.746 --> 16:23.346
I can't remember
the last four of my social.

16:23.348 --> 16:25.215
Lots of reps man.

16:25.217 --> 16:27.718
I'm in complete control of my environment.
People don't even know.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.389
- Hey, man, time to go.
- Okay.

16:31.391 --> 16:32.559
Wrap it up.

16:33.893 --> 16:36.093
- Just a little bit.
- Yeah, yeah.

16:36.095 --> 16:38.499
- Ziggy's going to kill me.
- Shit, not going to finish.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.569
A gift.

16:42.201 --> 16:43.500
How about a tip?

16:43.502 --> 16:45.234
We got you last time.

16:45.236 --> 16:46.737
Oh, yeah, you got me last...

16:46.739 --> 16:48.174
That's not how it works.

16:51.611 --> 16:54.781
Okay, really? Zoo animals.

17:00.251 --> 17:01.521
Need change?

17:02.855 --> 17:04.257
That's for you, <i>Fräulein.</i>

17:06.258 --> 17:07.560
Thanks.

17:08.926 --> 17:11.761
Are there always
so many cops in here?

17:11.762 --> 17:14.131
Last place
I'd think they'd be.

17:14.133 --> 17:17.200
Yeah, this their spot.
You know, cheap liquor.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.135
Right.

17:19.137 --> 17:22.141
Yeah, there also is a lot of
shady cats in here, huh?

17:23.709 --> 17:27.444
Yeah, it's kind of neutral
grounds, you know?

17:27.445 --> 17:29.782
Rick's in <i>Casablanca</i>
type shit.

17:31.783 --> 17:34.486
You must've heard
some stories in this place.

17:34.488 --> 17:37.954
You know, give him a couple of
drinks, steak on his plate,

17:37.956 --> 17:39.722
some nice women around him,

17:39.724 --> 17:41.428
he'll tell you
his darkest secrets.

17:42.627 --> 17:44.129
Loose lips sink ships.

17:44.829 --> 17:46.299
Ain't that the truth.

17:47.165 --> 17:49.403
Mmm, what about you?

17:51.636 --> 17:54.605
Pull a lot of pussy
in here? Yeah?

17:54.607 --> 17:55.672
Come on.

17:55.674 --> 17:57.478
- I do well for myself.
- Yeah.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.779
I'd fuck you.

18:02.647 --> 18:03.916
Kidding.

18:09.020 --> 18:10.255
All right.

18:12.324 --> 18:13.760
I'm out.

18:17.195 --> 18:18.996
See you later, man.

18:18.998 --> 18:20.366
Yeah.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.169
Look forward to it.

18:50.729 --> 18:52.866
- <i>Fräulein.</i>
- Dude, what the fuck are you...

19:11.384 --> 19:13.182
What the fuck?

19:32.904 --> 19:34.238
What's up, gangster?

19:34.240 --> 19:35.338
Oh, Peaches.

19:35.340 --> 19:38.710
Oh, <i>Fräulein,</i> you're up.

19:40.212 --> 19:42.080
Sit down.
You sit right there.

19:45.251 --> 19:47.084
What you walking
so slow for, nigga?

19:47.086 --> 19:49.589
I want you to sit right there.
That's you right there.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.294
- Look here. There's cigarettes.
- Yeah.

19:56.261 --> 19:58.596
Borracho!

19:58.598 --> 20:00.767
I think y'all got me
confused with somebody.

20:07.205 --> 20:08.441
Why my pants wet?

20:11.109 --> 20:13.809
Come on, man, if you and
your Uncle Tom over here

20:13.811 --> 20:15.912
are into some
homo shit, I'm good.

20:15.914 --> 20:17.250
Y'all just kill me now.

20:18.116 --> 20:19.587
You pissed yourself, bubba.

20:20.786 --> 20:22.619
It happens.

20:22.621 --> 20:25.956
I had one of the girls here
clean you up, so you're good.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.291
But y'all got the wrong dude.

20:28.293 --> 20:30.626
You got me confused
with someone.

20:30.628 --> 20:33.130
But I'm going to let you know
now, I ain't the one.

20:33.132 --> 20:34.797
What'd you say?

20:34.799 --> 20:36.633
Dude something?

20:36.635 --> 20:39.638
No, we're not mistaking you for anybody.
Don't be a fucking smartass.

20:41.139 --> 20:43.806
Arrested at 17 for GTA.

20:43.808 --> 20:46.276
Tried and convicted
as an adult.

20:46.278 --> 20:47.643
We know exactly who you are.

20:47.645 --> 20:49.779
Did a stint at county
for attempted manslaughter.

20:49.781 --> 20:52.749
Fastest speeding ticket
in California history.

20:52.751 --> 20:53.916
That's nice.

20:53.918 --> 20:55.988
Fucking genius, man.
How fast were you going?

20:59.459 --> 21:00.757
178.

21:02.126 --> 21:03.863
Speed demon!

21:06.499 --> 21:08.164
What did you say to the cop
who pulled you over?

21:08.166 --> 21:09.167
What reason did you give him?

21:10.769 --> 21:13.202
Told him they'd
just paved the road.

21:14.373 --> 21:15.939
- I like him.
- Ballsy.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.341
<i>Me gusta.</i>

21:17.343 --> 21:19.544
You may have a little pecker
for a black dude.

21:19.546 --> 21:23.513
You may be a bed-wetter, but you've
got some fucking style, buddy.

21:23.515 --> 21:27.551
All right, girls, time to go.

21:27.553 --> 21:29.885
Grab your shoes. Grab your shit.
Let's go.

21:29.887 --> 21:31.220
Time to go home
to your babies.

21:31.222 --> 21:32.692
- All right, thanks for stopping by.
- Excuse me.

21:41.066 --> 21:44.300
You check this out, hot rod.
You're a two-striker.

21:44.302 --> 21:46.902
You need to fucking look at me
when I'm talking to you.

21:46.904 --> 21:51.541
You're one mistake away from getting
sex in the ass every time you shower.

21:51.543 --> 21:55.045
Some of them niggas
got gas pumps.

21:55.047 --> 21:59.915
Now, personally, that shit don't
sound like a lot of fun to me.

21:59.917 --> 22:01.887
What you think?
How you feel about that?

22:04.222 --> 22:07.324
Look, the dude in that picture
is not even a regular at my bar.

22:07.326 --> 22:11.995
Like, I've seen him a few times, but,
you know, I don't associate myself...

22:18.737 --> 22:20.073
Do you know what this means?

22:22.074 --> 22:24.442
It means I am
a member of a clique.

22:24.444 --> 22:26.443
It's kind of like
being in a gang.

22:26.445 --> 22:30.079
Sort of like a gang,
only we have badges,

22:30.081 --> 22:32.951
which means you are done.

22:34.252 --> 22:35.455
He ain't lying.

22:40.925 --> 22:42.426
Let me ask you this.

22:42.428 --> 22:45.629
Okay, do we look like the
types who will arrest you?

22:45.631 --> 22:48.735
Put you in handcuffs,
drag you down to the station?

22:49.134 --> 22:51.233
Hmm?

22:51.235 --> 22:52.935
I'm asking you
a fucking question.

22:52.937 --> 22:54.970
No. Not at all.

22:54.972 --> 22:57.575
Right, exactly.

22:57.577 --> 23:00.947
We just shoot you.
It's less paperwork.

23:03.248 --> 23:04.585
So tell me,

23:07.786 --> 23:10.089
what the fuck are you doing
hanging out in that crew?

23:11.990 --> 23:13.590
You're a pussy.

23:13.592 --> 23:15.791
Those dudes are bad dudes.

23:15.793 --> 23:19.895
Great thieves
but straight convicts.

23:19.897 --> 23:22.798
What's Merrimen doing drinking
beers with the likes of you for?

23:22.800 --> 23:23.967
Talk shop?

23:23.969 --> 23:25.935
You gonna hit
the fucking Hofbrau?

23:25.937 --> 23:29.005
Take the place down, score, like,
what, two grand in ones and fives?

23:29.007 --> 23:30.441
Is that what's afoot?
I'll answer that for you.

23:30.443 --> 23:32.111
No, it fucking isn't.

23:33.979 --> 23:36.513
I don't know what crew
you're speaking about, man.

23:36.515 --> 23:38.482
This dude just comes to
my bar where I work...

23:38.484 --> 23:41.788
Stop. Shut up.

23:48.793 --> 23:50.528
Come on, man. This is
some weird shit. Just...

23:50.530 --> 23:53.431
You listen to me, fuckface.

23:53.433 --> 23:55.164
We don't give
a shit about you.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.503
You in Merrimen's crew?

23:59.505 --> 24:00.607
Hmm?

24:01.673 --> 24:03.806
Huh? You hit the stadium?

24:05.511 --> 24:07.309
You talky-talky now?

24:07.311 --> 24:08.680
Yes, please.

24:14.853 --> 24:15.888
Fuck!

24:23.862 --> 24:25.327
I'm just the driver!

24:25.329 --> 24:27.897
I'm just the driver!

24:27.899 --> 24:30.700
They don't give me no gun.
I don't do no gangster shit.

24:30.702 --> 24:33.068
They asked me to drive,
so that's what I do.

24:33.070 --> 24:35.672
That's it. Fuck!

24:35.674 --> 24:38.576
Why did Merrimen hijack
an empty armored car?

24:38.578 --> 24:40.210
I don't know, all right?

24:40.212 --> 24:42.077
They keep me in the dark
for shit like this.

24:42.079 --> 24:43.345
If the cops come down on me,

24:43.347 --> 24:45.382
I can't tell them shit
if I don't know shit.

24:45.385 --> 24:47.683
Now y'all can hook me up
to a lie detector,

24:47.685 --> 24:49.920
a fucking polygraph,
whatever y'all got.

24:49.922 --> 24:52.989
I'm telling you what I know,
and that's all you'll get.

24:52.991 --> 24:54.894
Please, just let me
the fuck go.

24:57.061 --> 25:00.232
Fuck y'all, man.
Let me go.

25:02.067 --> 25:05.235
Well, I thought that was
relatively convincing, hmm?

25:05.237 --> 25:06.440
Good stuff.

25:08.407 --> 25:09.575
All right,
when did you meet him?

25:10.577 --> 25:12.208
What do I get out of this?

25:12.210 --> 25:16.249
What do you get out of this?
Well, your freedom for one.

25:17.584 --> 25:18.951
Two,

25:21.453 --> 25:22.922
you're not the bad guys.

25:23.754 --> 25:24.924
We are.

25:30.463 --> 25:33.729
Couple months ago,
they came through the bar,

25:33.731 --> 25:36.098
<i>and I served them
a few drinks.</i>

25:36.100 --> 25:37.767
<i>We started talking.</i>

25:37.769 --> 25:39.604
This is my boy, Bosco.

25:39.606 --> 25:42.074
My brother for life.
We deployed together.

25:43.475 --> 25:45.243
Hey, the kid can drive.

25:46.778 --> 25:48.613
Okay.

25:48.615 --> 25:51.615
Donnie, tell him about
the Trans Am Series.

25:51.617 --> 25:54.787
Drove Trans Am Series, like
he said, for about a season.

25:55.488 --> 25:56.956
What were their names?

25:58.089 --> 25:59.791
Hawaiian dude,

26:00.959 --> 26:02.995
he had a homie,
Bosco, white boy.

26:04.663 --> 26:08.230
He was in the military,
and he worked for DWP.

26:08.232 --> 26:10.269
I told him I needed
some extra money,

26:11.168 --> 26:13.135
so he gave me a job.

26:13.137 --> 26:15.474
Who's that? Merrimen?

26:16.642 --> 26:18.110
Merrimen.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.977
<i>Ray Merrimen.</i>

26:28.819 --> 26:30.621
So what's up with this dude?

26:30.623 --> 26:31.856
It's Marcus' boy.

26:34.291 --> 26:36.825
Worked with him
over at the Hofbrau.

26:36.827 --> 26:39.462
Say he did some time
with him at Wayside.

26:39.464 --> 26:40.665
He was a Marine for a minute.

26:43.668 --> 26:45.804
Say the nigga can drive.
He be cool.

26:47.172 --> 26:50.876
All right,
let's check him out.

26:52.109 --> 26:54.511
<i>Real smart dude.</i>

26:54.513 --> 26:56.848
<i>He had just got out of prison
from what I could tell.</i>

27:03.187 --> 27:04.523
You ready to roll, Ray?

27:05.190 --> 27:06.192
514!

27:13.365 --> 27:14.900
Come on, let's cuff them up.

27:33.050 --> 27:34.386
See you soon, Ray.

27:40.725 --> 27:41.891
No, you won't.

27:41.893 --> 27:43.527
<i>Where'd you meet him?</i>

27:43.529 --> 27:46.261
<i>It was in Carson,
at the Hawaiian dude's house.</i>

27:49.402 --> 27:51.568
- Donnie, what's good, man?
- What's up?

27:51.570 --> 27:53.338
- Come on, man. Follow me.
- Yeah, yeah.

27:56.040 --> 27:57.242
Hey.

27:58.411 --> 28:00.577
Oh, shit. What's up?

28:00.579 --> 28:02.581
- Donnie, beer?
- Yeah, yeah.

28:03.714 --> 28:04.750
Thank you. Thank you.

28:13.759 --> 28:15.627
So you spent
some time at Wayside?

28:16.293 --> 28:17.729
Yeah, a little bit.

28:19.432 --> 28:21.601
What do they serve
for breakfast on Fridays?

28:27.138 --> 28:29.104
Silver dollar pancakes.

28:29.106 --> 28:30.276
Three of them.

28:32.444 --> 28:33.446
Where you from?

28:33.912 --> 28:34.980
Hawthorne.

28:36.947 --> 28:38.484
So you can drive, huh?

28:40.285 --> 28:41.618
Oh, I can drive.

28:47.925 --> 28:49.659
Drive.

28:49.661 --> 28:51.630
You might want to
put that seat belt on.

29:16.087 --> 29:17.256
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:35.006 --> 29:39.008
He liked how I drove, so, a
week later, I did my first gig.

29:39.010 --> 29:41.012
<i>We hit this rave at a stadium.</i>

30:11.076 --> 30:12.344
Got one.

30:33.432 --> 30:35.934
Minus the dye pack,
is the count all good?

30:38.537 --> 30:40.072
The count is on.

30:45.511 --> 30:48.076
That's a lot of money
right there, bro.

30:48.078 --> 30:50.078
Why don't we
just call it a day?

30:50.080 --> 30:51.948
Really?

30:51.950 --> 30:54.383
You want three in hot bills,

30:54.385 --> 30:57.421
you looking over your shoulder
for the rest of your life,

30:57.423 --> 30:59.459
or would you rather
have 30 clean?

31:00.626 --> 31:02.060
I'm just saying.

31:03.795 --> 31:05.798
Let's just call it quits
while we're ahead.

31:08.567 --> 31:09.603
Put it away.

31:10.603 --> 31:11.904
We're trading up.

31:15.307 --> 31:18.277
All right. Fuck it.
Let's do it.

31:19.578 --> 31:21.310
What happened to the cash?

31:21.312 --> 31:22.647
I don't know.

31:23.280 --> 31:24.750
They don't tell me.

31:25.783 --> 31:27.285
They don't talk much.

31:29.788 --> 31:32.790
Yeah, people with things to
hide never have much to say.

31:35.594 --> 31:38.998
So am I under arrest,
or can I leave?

31:41.933 --> 31:44.401
Nah, you just keep
doing your thing.

31:44.403 --> 31:45.671
We'll be in touch.

32:03.154 --> 32:05.121
Yeah?

32:05.123 --> 32:08.294
<i>Horsepower, be at 1st and
Central at 0800. Don't be late.</i>

33:42.421 --> 33:43.423
Jesus Christ!

33:44.955 --> 33:47.792
You scared the shit out of me,
babe. Can't do that.

33:48.627 --> 33:50.295
What are you doing right now?

33:55.633 --> 33:57.269
You erasing your recent calls?

34:00.473 --> 34:03.271
My phone? What do you mean?

34:03.273 --> 34:06.108
I don't know how to work this
fucking thing. You know that.

34:06.110 --> 34:08.445
"I don't know how to work this
fucking thing. You know that."

34:08.447 --> 34:09.614
Come on.

34:11.616 --> 34:14.617
Babe, we really have
to go through this right now?

34:14.619 --> 34:15.652
Where you been?

34:18.956 --> 34:21.292
It's 6:00 a.m.
Where have you been?

34:22.494 --> 34:24.259
Been at work?

34:24.261 --> 34:28.130
Surveillance? Robbing drug dealers?
Because you smell like a stripper.

34:28.132 --> 34:29.635
Of course, I was at work.

34:34.772 --> 34:35.940
It's funny
'cause I got this text.

34:38.444 --> 34:39.812
What was so hot, then?

34:40.478 --> 34:41.847
Is that a work text?

34:42.746 --> 34:43.748
Huh?

34:48.319 --> 34:50.819
You fucked up.
You text me instead.

34:53.690 --> 34:54.993
Who does that?

35:00.999 --> 35:04.167
It's street theater, babe.
It's not what it looks like.

35:04.169 --> 35:05.203
I'm sorry.

35:06.136 --> 35:07.339
Me, too.

35:19.350 --> 35:21.153
Fuck.

35:23.053 --> 35:24.554
We're going
to go to Auntie's house

35:24.556 --> 35:26.955
because Daddy's got to do
a little work on the house.

35:26.957 --> 35:28.390
And we have
something else to do.

35:28.392 --> 35:29.694
- Come on.
- What the fuck?

35:30.662 --> 35:32.328
Hey, yo.

35:32.330 --> 35:34.196
It's gonna be too loud
for you guys, okay?

35:34.198 --> 35:36.532
- Deb? Deb?
- Will you put this on?

35:36.534 --> 35:37.899
- Is Daddy coming with us?
- What are you doing, Deb?

35:37.901 --> 35:40.169
What the fuck are you doing?

35:40.171 --> 35:41.671
- It will be too loud for you guys.
- Wifey, wifey.

35:41.673 --> 35:43.207
Seriously,
what are you doing?

35:44.209 --> 35:45.674
Is Daddy coming with us?

35:45.676 --> 35:47.476
No, Daddy does not have
enough time for us right now.

35:47.478 --> 35:49.879
- Seriously... That's nice. That's nice.
- Can you put this on here?

35:49.881 --> 35:51.913
Hey, honey.
Mommy didn't mean that, okay?

35:51.915 --> 35:54.884
Hey, sweetie, come here.
Mommy didn't mean that, okay?

35:54.886 --> 35:58.190
She didn't mean that, okay?
Sweetie, you okay?

35:59.592 --> 36:00.922
Yeah, great. Great.

36:00.924 --> 36:03.225
Hey. Come here, honey.

36:03.227 --> 36:04.727
I'm not going to be able
to make it right now,

36:04.729 --> 36:06.895
but I'm gonna come
a little later, okay?

36:06.897 --> 36:08.397
All right. Come here.
Give me a hug.

36:08.399 --> 36:10.332
- Time to go right now.
- Christ sake.

36:10.334 --> 36:11.901
Will you slow it down
a second?

36:11.903 --> 36:13.268
Give Daddy some rest.
He's real tired.

36:13.270 --> 36:14.904
- Right, hon?
- What...

36:14.906 --> 36:18.110
Deb. Deb. Deb, will you
slow it down a second?

36:19.243 --> 36:20.743
- We're going to walk this way...
- Deb.

36:20.745 --> 36:23.011
Okay, watch your step.
Here we go.

36:23.013 --> 36:24.414
Deb, can you slow it...

36:24.416 --> 36:26.781
Okay. Come on.

36:26.783 --> 36:28.552
Let's go. We're going to
put your sister in first.

36:28.554 --> 36:30.886
Here we go. Okay, baby, ready?

36:30.888 --> 36:32.888
Sweetie, it's going to be
okay, sweetie. Okay?

36:32.890 --> 36:34.756
Let's go.

36:34.758 --> 36:37.892
Okay, put your bags in there. You
wanna put your sister in the seat?

36:37.894 --> 36:38.963
Where's the pink bag?

36:40.098 --> 36:42.230
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

36:42.232 --> 36:44.299
Oh, great language right
in front of my daughter.

36:44.301 --> 36:45.734
Great fathering!

36:45.736 --> 36:47.603
Nice. Nice. Dropping F-bombs
in front of my daughters.

36:47.605 --> 36:50.574
- "My kids," huh? "My kids?"
- Great fathering!

36:50.576 --> 36:53.612
Gonna find a guy whose cock
actually gets hard for me.

36:54.946 --> 36:56.748
Deb, Deb, Deb. Stop!

36:57.649 --> 36:58.951
Please don't do this.

37:00.785 --> 37:02.321
Please.

37:14.932 --> 37:18.267
This is a little hard. You're just
scared right now, okay? You're confused.

37:18.269 --> 37:19.270
Okay...

37:22.339 --> 37:24.175
Out of the way, Nick.
Get out of the way, Nick.

37:26.343 --> 37:28.643
Get the fuck
out of here, you fucker!

37:28.645 --> 37:30.245
You motherfucker!

37:30.247 --> 37:34.350
You get back! You understand
me, you motherfucker?

37:35.487 --> 37:36.821
- Stay away from us!
- Nice. Nice.

37:37.588 --> 37:38.790
Good. Good.

37:46.029 --> 37:47.999
Okay. Mommy's okay.

37:57.374 --> 37:58.676
See you later.

38:04.848 --> 38:06.318
Perfect.

38:09.821 --> 38:11.189
Morning.

38:31.008 --> 38:33.676
Ran the prints on CAL-ID.

38:33.678 --> 38:36.078
Got a hit on our
dead guy from Angel City.

38:36.080 --> 38:39.681
- Check your e-mail.
- All right.

38:39.683 --> 38:42.752
Name's Marcus Rhodes,
from Oakland.

38:42.754 --> 38:45.687
ATF was looking for him
for gun charges.

38:45.689 --> 38:47.890
And more to the point
that you were making before,

38:47.892 --> 38:51.660
he was stationed at Twentynine Palms
the same time Merrimen was there.

38:51.662 --> 38:53.365
This is good.
Give me the book on Merrimen.

38:57.200 --> 38:58.537
Look to your right.

38:59.505 --> 39:01.069
You know what that is?

39:01.071 --> 39:03.606
It's the bank for banks.

39:03.608 --> 39:07.076
Los Angeles branch
of the Federal Reserve.

39:07.078 --> 39:09.214
It's the only bank
that's never been robbed.

39:16.953 --> 39:19.556
All the surrounding streets
are wired for sound and image.

39:19.558 --> 39:22.559
Stand across the street and stare
at the building for two minutes,

39:22.561 --> 39:25.361
you'll have security on your ass
asking you politely to leave.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.263
If they see your face again,

39:27.265 --> 39:30.434
every Secret Service agent in the
country is going to be looking for you.

39:30.436 --> 39:31.437
The place is case-proof.

39:34.138 --> 39:38.073
There have been
53 break-in attempts.

39:38.075 --> 39:39.877
Not one has
got past the lobby.

39:43.281 --> 39:44.916
That's why
we're going to rob it.

39:45.616 --> 39:48.216
Okay, here we go.

39:48.218 --> 39:50.487
Laguna Niguel was in '06.

39:50.489 --> 39:54.089
Got caught for that, get sent
up to USP Victorville SHU

39:54.091 --> 39:56.959
until June of '16.
Now give me the unsolved book.

39:56.961 --> 39:58.993
<i>As soon as
you enter the lobby,</i>

39:58.995 --> 40:01.597
<i>computers run you through every law
enforcement database in the country.</i>

40:01.599 --> 40:03.765
If you've got outstanding
parking tickets,

40:03.767 --> 40:06.634
they're going to know about it before you
get through the first level of security.

40:06.636 --> 40:09.071
All the employees wear
security swipe cards

40:09.073 --> 40:11.306
that grant them access through
the first set of man-traps.

40:11.308 --> 40:14.310
<i>Access is severely restricted.</i>

40:14.312 --> 40:16.579
<i>Two stories below street level
is the vault floor.</i>

40:16.581 --> 40:17.783
By the way,

40:18.483 --> 40:20.483
uh, his crimey...

40:20.485 --> 40:21.587
- Levoux?
- Levoux.

40:22.252 --> 40:24.185
He serve with Merrimen?

40:24.187 --> 40:27.456
Not only that, but they played football
in high school at Long Beach Poly.

40:27.458 --> 40:29.859
- You've got to be shitting me.
- No.

40:29.861 --> 40:33.429
<i>Central Security, it's
the nerve center for the Fed.</i>

40:33.431 --> 40:37.332
<i>This is where the armored cars
come in, drop off the money tubs.</i>

40:37.334 --> 40:39.536
<i>Money tubs are handed off
to the Fed employees.</i>

40:39.538 --> 40:45.140
<i>At any one time, there's anywhere between
500 and 800 billion dollars in there,</i>

40:45.142 --> 40:48.776
<i>every millimeter of it covered by
cameras, sensors, and motion detectors.</i>

40:48.778 --> 40:50.480
Yeah. What did they
specialize in?

40:50.482 --> 40:54.116
I got this from the HR desk
at Twentynine Palms.

40:54.118 --> 40:57.720
Close Quarter Battle Unit. Both
saw combat in the Middle East.

40:57.722 --> 41:02.156
Levoux specializes in explosives, where
Merrimen specializes in soldiering,

41:02.158 --> 41:05.026
both MARSOC fast Marines.

41:05.028 --> 41:06.861
But there's a hitch.

41:06.863 --> 41:10.165
The serial number of every bill is
recorded in the Fed's database.

41:10.167 --> 41:11.568
<i>So, if a note goes missing,</i>

41:11.570 --> 41:13.067
<i>they're going to know
exactly which one it is.</i>

41:13.069 --> 41:15.803
They're going to flag it.
If that bill comes up again,

41:15.805 --> 41:18.806
whoever recirculates that cash, no
matter where they are in the world,

41:18.808 --> 41:20.042
that person can be tracked.

41:20.044 --> 41:22.343
Okay. Bosco,
the peckerwood?

41:22.345 --> 41:25.514
He's a Huntington Beach kid,
also MARSOC Marines.

41:25.516 --> 41:28.216
He did comms with them.
He had a solid career.

41:28.218 --> 41:30.352
But he didn't serve together
with the other guys.

41:30.354 --> 41:32.988
He was the Wood Rep at Victorville
when Merrimen was there.

41:32.990 --> 41:34.989
That's where they linked up.

41:34.991 --> 41:38.727
Donnie was a Marine for a
year and a half, then discharged.

41:38.729 --> 41:40.429
So, the way I see it,

41:40.431 --> 41:42.196
that's the way all these niggas
ended up working together.

41:42.198 --> 41:45.434
There's only two passports on the
streets, sports and military.

41:45.436 --> 41:48.203
Every time the Fed receives
a deposit from a bank,

41:48.205 --> 41:51.105
<i>first thing they do is send that
money up to the count rooms.</i>

41:51.107 --> 41:53.443
<i>They run the notes
through the counting machines.</i>

41:53.445 --> 41:55.209
<i>They're accomplishing
two things here.</i>

41:55.211 --> 41:57.779
<i>First, they're double-checking the
accuracy of the bank's deposit.</i>

41:57.781 --> 41:59.348
<i>If the bank is off at all,</i>

41:59.350 --> 42:01.183
they're going to credit or
debit the account accordingly.

42:01.185 --> 42:06.921
Two, they're separating newer, fit
currency from old unfit bills.

42:06.923 --> 42:09.559
But most importantly, they're
erasing the serial numbers

42:09.561 --> 42:11.859
of the old bills
from the Fed system.

42:11.861 --> 42:15.763
Once those numbers are erased, to
the Fed, to the rest of the world,

42:15.765 --> 42:18.067
that money
has ceased to exist.

42:18.069 --> 42:19.634
Wait, let's look at
the unsolved cases.

42:19.636 --> 42:24.038
In '04, you have the Boller
National Bank Hollywood job, okay?

42:24.040 --> 42:25.741
They tunneled through
the sewer system.

42:25.743 --> 42:29.812
Sophisticated, skill set,
someone with access, unsolved.

42:29.814 --> 42:33.483
Okay, in '05, you have the
Fuerte armored car depot job.

42:33.485 --> 42:35.585
Blew the depot vault
with shaped charges.

42:35.587 --> 42:37.554
In the $100 count room alone,

42:37.556 --> 42:42.223
an average of $30 million is
designated as unfit every day.

42:42.225 --> 42:43.725
Between 4:00 p.m.
and 5:00 p.m.,

42:43.727 --> 42:46.063
<i>all the cash gets shot out
to the shredder.</i>

42:46.731 --> 42:47.933
It's all destroyed.

42:49.299 --> 42:55.169
$30 million
turned to dust in seconds.

42:55.171 --> 42:57.474
It's then picked up by the
Fed's waste management company

42:57.476 --> 42:58.843
and brought out to the dump.

43:00.512 --> 43:02.512
If we can get to
those unfit bills

43:02.514 --> 43:05.814
before they go to the shredders
and get out clean...

43:05.816 --> 43:08.585
You got $30 million
nobody is looking for.

43:08.587 --> 43:09.785
Bingo.

43:09.787 --> 43:12.154
In '06,
you have Laguna Niguel.

43:12.156 --> 43:15.823
Same thing, only this time Merrimen
gets unlucky with the tail-light.

43:15.825 --> 43:20.828
Goes to prison till 2016. Now in
that time, while he was in prison,

43:20.830 --> 43:23.931
how many highly sophisticated,
well-executed heists do we have?

43:23.933 --> 43:25.667
None, but you're
on a roll. Keep going.

43:25.669 --> 43:29.606
The counter guy at the donut shop?
Witness to the whole thing.

43:29.608 --> 43:30.675
They left him. Why?

43:33.545 --> 43:37.145
Because they shoot uniforms,
not unarmed civilians.

43:37.147 --> 43:38.883
Exactly what
they were trained to do.

43:39.783 --> 43:41.453
Gangbangers, these are not.

43:42.386 --> 43:46.888
Okay, these are our guys.

43:46.890 --> 43:50.861
We nail these guys,
we solve all these cases.

43:51.629 --> 43:53.832
This is the crew.

43:55.865 --> 43:58.570
You still haven't told us how
you can get past that security.

44:00.071 --> 44:01.873
We're not going in this way.

44:04.408 --> 44:06.077
We're going in that way.

44:16.053 --> 44:17.852
What's going on
with <i>Fräulein?</i>

44:17.854 --> 44:19.757
We can move on him
anytime we want.

44:21.758 --> 44:23.692
- I pay minimum wage.
- Okay.

44:23.694 --> 44:27.062
Plus $3 for delivery.
And you split the tip with me.

44:27.064 --> 44:29.198
You start Wednesday, 11:00.

44:29.200 --> 44:30.933
Thank you.

44:30.935 --> 44:32.901
I don't really like the
food there, but I'm down to go,

44:32.903 --> 44:35.002
- but you've got to pay this time.
- I'm not paying it.

44:35.004 --> 44:36.438
What?

44:36.440 --> 44:39.107
- I pay every fucking time.
- What?

44:39.109 --> 44:40.443
Get off your wallet, buddy.

44:40.445 --> 44:42.111
No, I forgot my wallet today,
boys. I'm sorry.

44:42.113 --> 44:43.879
- Again?
- Yeah, again.

44:43.881 --> 44:45.180
Got an alligator arm.

44:45.182 --> 44:48.550
I sat down at blackjack
with $5, and I made $160.

44:48.552 --> 44:50.187
Nicholas O'Brien?

44:51.756 --> 44:53.221
Yeah?

44:53.223 --> 44:55.225
I suggest you take these.

44:56.527 --> 44:57.795
You're being served.

44:58.928 --> 45:00.261
You kidding me?

45:00.263 --> 45:01.599
I'm afraid not.

45:03.801 --> 45:04.903
What's going on?

45:06.035 --> 45:08.102
You all right, bro?

45:08.104 --> 45:09.574
Yeah, I guess
I'm getting divorced.

45:10.774 --> 45:12.209
He say "divorced"?

45:13.977 --> 45:15.245
Yo.

45:16.946 --> 45:18.946
Welcome to the fucking club.

45:18.948 --> 45:20.784
Now, go handle your business,
big man.

45:39.269 --> 45:41.837
There's a closer view.

45:41.839 --> 45:44.507
There was a rolling blackout in
this quadrant four days ago.

45:44.509 --> 45:46.442
Yeah, they've been happening a
lot over the last few months.

45:46.444 --> 45:48.142
Okay.

45:48.144 --> 45:50.579
They say they have full backup
power, but actually they don't.

45:50.581 --> 45:53.781
- They go into brown-out.
- Yeah, prioritize the grid.

45:53.783 --> 45:56.819
Priority, of course, is the vault.
So everything in there stays intact.

45:56.821 --> 45:59.489
But anything that is peripheral,
like cameras in the hallway,

45:59.491 --> 46:02.658
shredders in the count rooms,
everything else cuts out.

46:02.660 --> 46:06.194
To time it during another rolling blackout
is going to be fucking impossible.

46:06.196 --> 46:08.997
- So you want to simulate it?
- Can we?

46:08.999 --> 46:11.033
Break in, have them go brown
for about two minutes.

46:11.035 --> 46:14.203
I'd say yes, but I'd like
to have data to be sure.

46:14.205 --> 46:15.770
Great.

46:15.772 --> 46:18.172
Once we breach the count room,
only thing left is the cameras.

46:18.174 --> 46:20.008
They run on their
own power supply,

46:20.010 --> 46:22.612
so they're unaffected
by the brown-out.

46:22.614 --> 46:26.214
The solve here is
we run an EMP burst.

46:26.216 --> 46:29.651
Should take out the cameras
and motion for about 30 feet.

46:29.653 --> 46:31.689
Where you get all this
information from?

46:33.525 --> 46:35.691
You don't have to
worry about that.

46:35.693 --> 46:37.395
Just trust me
when I say it's solid.

46:39.062 --> 46:40.863
How we doing
with the Telecal hook?

46:40.865 --> 46:43.234
Couple days.
Shouldn't be a problem.

46:45.503 --> 46:46.904
<i>How many handlers do you need?</i>

46:53.176 --> 46:54.547
<i>Uh, gate B right now.</i>

46:56.680 --> 46:59.384
Strolling right into
the Federal Reserve.

47:05.421 --> 47:07.357
<i>Force leaving loading dock B.</i>

47:20.270 --> 47:21.272
ID?

47:29.514 --> 47:30.715
Sign in, please.

47:41.024 --> 47:42.790
Keep this on you
at all times.

47:42.792 --> 47:45.563
Second bay of elevators.
Cafeteria's level 2.

47:49.299 --> 47:50.569
Buzz him in. He's good.

47:52.102 --> 47:53.606
Smells good.

47:55.039 --> 47:56.274
He's good. Let him in.

48:15.926 --> 48:18.627
- Sharon?
- Mmm-hmm. That's me.

48:18.629 --> 48:21.129
- How you all doing?
- Good. How you are doing today?

48:21.131 --> 48:23.569
- He's fine.
- Thank you.

48:24.301 --> 48:25.767
She ain't getting none.

48:25.769 --> 48:28.169
Shut up. Really?

48:28.171 --> 48:30.505
Y'all have a good day.
I'm gonna stay out of it.

48:30.507 --> 48:32.774
- We will now.
- You have a wonderful day.

48:32.776 --> 48:36.143
Lunch. Dessert.
Lunch. Dessert.

48:36.145 --> 48:37.147
Bye, sunshine.

49:09.447 --> 49:10.549
There he goes.

49:21.959 --> 49:23.995
My gosh.

49:24.861 --> 49:26.196
Aw!

49:35.839 --> 49:36.841
- Oh, he's here.
- Okay.

49:45.182 --> 49:47.915
Damn, girl looking fine.

49:47.917 --> 49:50.419
Thank you.
You look amazing.

49:50.421 --> 49:52.554
How are you?

49:52.556 --> 49:54.388
- Looking good.
- Thank you.

49:54.390 --> 49:56.424
- This is my mom. This is Rolando.
- Hi.

49:56.426 --> 49:58.993
- Nice to meet you. Rolando.
- Hi, I'm Malia. Nice to meet you.

49:58.995 --> 50:01.395
- I see where you get your looks from.
- Thank you.

50:03.901 --> 50:05.100
Thank you.

50:05.102 --> 50:06.937
- Can I take that?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

50:08.572 --> 50:11.272
Um, Rolando,
this is my dad.

50:11.274 --> 50:14.579
What's up, Mr. Levoux?
Nice to meet you.

50:17.414 --> 50:19.783
Let me holler at him
for a second.

50:22.019 --> 50:23.454
Let me talk to you, bruh.

50:31.529 --> 50:34.599
Honey, don't worry about it.
Okay? They're just gonna talk.

50:42.738 --> 50:44.406
So here's what's up.

50:44.408 --> 50:46.374
For the past 16 years,

50:46.376 --> 50:49.044
my daughter's safety and protection
has been my responsibility

50:49.046 --> 50:51.245
and my responsibility only.

50:51.247 --> 50:55.453
Now, for the first time in her life, I see
I've got to hand you that responsibility.

50:56.587 --> 50:57.919
Don't fuck up,

50:57.921 --> 50:59.621
or your mama
will weep as she has

50:59.623 --> 51:02.560
to wheel your ass around every
day the rest of your life.

51:05.328 --> 51:09.296
Now I worked on this, because I want to
say this to you as nice as possible.

51:09.298 --> 51:10.799
Do you understand?

51:10.801 --> 51:13.134
Yeah. Yes, sir.

51:18.476 --> 51:20.442
It's all right.
It's all right.

51:20.444 --> 51:22.310
Listen. Listen.

51:22.312 --> 51:24.913
All he's trying to say is,
it's wonderful to meet you,

51:24.915 --> 51:26.984
and he wants you
to have a beautiful evening.

51:28.685 --> 51:30.254
I'll see you at 11:30.

51:30.988 --> 51:32.487
Yeah. Yeah.

51:32.489 --> 51:35.258
- 11:30. Yeah. 11:30.
- Good choice.

51:42.999 --> 51:44.668
I think he got
the picture, bro.

51:49.839 --> 51:50.841
Psst.

52:23.372 --> 52:25.140
Beers and sake,
let's go.

52:25.142 --> 52:27.579
- Have wine.
- What the fuck?

53:01.711 --> 53:02.712
Hey.

53:03.714 --> 53:04.749
Buddy.

53:06.682 --> 53:08.015
Donnie, right?

53:08.017 --> 53:09.917
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

53:09.919 --> 53:11.785
Yeah, spotted you at the gym
the other day, yeah?

53:11.787 --> 53:13.388
Yeah, man. How you doing?

53:13.390 --> 53:14.959
What's up, fellows?

53:18.227 --> 53:19.696
You play football
at Long Beach Poly?

53:20.397 --> 53:21.533
You look familiar.

53:22.599 --> 53:24.202
No, I'm not from around here.

53:27.203 --> 53:29.439
What are you doing here?
You work around here?

53:31.374 --> 53:33.541
Enjoying my dinner, man.

53:33.543 --> 53:34.908
- Really?
- Yeah.

53:34.910 --> 53:35.912
Food here sucks.

53:37.482 --> 53:41.752
Yeah. Yeah,
we come here for the ass.

53:47.124 --> 53:48.627
So I'll see ya
at the gym, man.

53:53.229 --> 53:56.230
Yeah. Definitely.

53:56.232 --> 53:57.603
Have a good night.

54:04.740 --> 54:08.276
Number 55, right?
That's how I remember you.

54:08.278 --> 54:10.414
We wore the same
number, 55, right?

54:11.147 --> 54:12.680
I went to South Torrance.

54:12.682 --> 54:15.583
Yeah, we played you guys
a couple of times.

54:15.585 --> 54:18.252
You and all those
fat-ass Samoans.

54:18.254 --> 54:21.656
Yeah, they were big,
but, man, lazy motherfuckers.

54:21.658 --> 54:23.094
Probably all that Spam.

54:24.995 --> 54:27.027
Yeah, we fucking
crushed you guys.

54:27.029 --> 54:30.033
Crushed you guys when I was there.
Crushed you guys when you were there.

54:30.834 --> 54:32.303
Still crushing you guys.

54:34.605 --> 54:36.937
We've got family here, bro.

54:36.939 --> 54:38.606
Don't really appreciate
you popping off.

54:38.608 --> 54:41.843
All right. All right, man.
No need to get all agro.

54:41.845 --> 54:44.649
Was I being rude?
Was I being rude?

54:46.048 --> 54:48.149
- What?
- Let's go order, bro.

54:48.151 --> 54:49.984
Hey, look, man, listen.

54:49.986 --> 54:53.492
You've got a beautiful family.
Everything's all good. Excuse us.

54:56.859 --> 54:58.028
<i>Kampai.</i>

54:59.463 --> 55:00.865
See you at the gym, Donnie.

55:02.232 --> 55:03.634
Have a good night, ladies.

55:31.861 --> 55:32.930
You a cop?

55:34.698 --> 55:36.901
No. Are you?

55:45.709 --> 55:46.777
Get out of the car.

55:55.752 --> 55:56.754
Go!

56:16.772 --> 56:18.038
- Where's the wire?
- Come on, man.

56:18.040 --> 56:19.776
I'm not wearing
a fucking wire, man.

56:21.711 --> 56:23.877
Man, I'm not wearing
no fucking wire.

56:28.819 --> 56:29.954
Get up.

56:39.463 --> 56:41.563
How does he know you?

56:41.565 --> 56:43.400
Don't tell me
it's from the fucking gym.

56:45.001 --> 56:46.968
Look, I don't know him.

56:46.970 --> 56:47.972
Smoke this punk.

56:52.008 --> 56:54.776
Talk, motherfucker.

56:54.778 --> 56:56.944
I'm not no cop, all right?

56:56.946 --> 56:58.846
Now he came to me.
He know you.

56:58.848 --> 57:01.816
He know all of you.
But I ain't tell him shit.

57:01.818 --> 57:03.417
He was sweating me.
I ain't seen him since.

57:03.419 --> 57:04.988
I thought he'd leave us alone.

57:13.162 --> 57:14.631
So how much do they know?

57:16.467 --> 57:17.469
Nothing.

57:18.702 --> 57:20.469
I ain't tell them shit.

57:20.471 --> 57:23.004
I don't know nothing anyway.

57:23.006 --> 57:25.843
And you know I'm the last
person that would fuck this up.

57:27.944 --> 57:30.014
Now, if we've got to
call it off, I get it.

57:31.147 --> 57:32.850
But I know
I ain't tell them shit.

57:56.474 --> 57:59.544
Friday. Make sure
he knows it's on.

58:27.037 --> 58:29.069
So good.

58:29.071 --> 58:31.908
It's true, though. It's true.

58:32.543 --> 58:33.944
Okay.

58:34.512 --> 58:35.679
Okay.

58:45.523 --> 58:46.955
How you doing, Nick?

58:46.957 --> 58:48.192
Hmm.

58:50.060 --> 58:52.093
- I'm Nick.
- Hello.

58:52.095 --> 58:54.265
- How are you?
- Good.

58:58.801 --> 59:00.401
What's for...

59:00.403 --> 59:02.904
- What's for dinner?
- You smell like alcohol, Nick.

59:02.906 --> 59:04.108
Hmm?

59:07.776 --> 59:08.878
Relax.

59:09.778 --> 59:11.748
I already ate.

59:18.455 --> 59:20.455
Give me a pen, stud.

59:20.457 --> 59:22.625
Nick, I was gonna call you.

59:22.627 --> 59:24.158
I was gonna take you
to dinner next week.

59:24.160 --> 59:26.163
Just give me a fucking pen.

59:44.180 --> 59:45.516
Thanks, Rudd.

59:47.783 --> 59:50.521
- I'm gonna hit the...
- No, you're not.

59:57.426 --> 59:58.928
How's the wine?

01:00:01.464 --> 01:00:02.799
Good?

01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:08.671
That's pretty fucking good.

01:00:10.372 --> 01:00:12.172
So I imagine
I just, uh...

01:00:12.174 --> 01:00:16.013
What, just sign
anywhere, yeah?

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:18.312
Okay.

01:00:18.314 --> 01:00:21.883
And I imagine it's assumed
that if you were ever

01:00:21.885 --> 01:00:25.819
to touch one of my girls
or, say, talk to them

01:00:25.821 --> 01:00:27.691
or, you know,
even look at them,

01:00:29.158 --> 01:00:32.359
I go boom-boom. You
know what I'm saying?

01:00:32.361 --> 01:00:33.861
But, I mean, that's
self-evident, right?

01:00:33.863 --> 01:00:36.698
There's no need to put that
in the contract, is there?

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:38.002
- No, I didn't think so.
- Nick...

01:00:43.205 --> 01:00:45.509
Can you please go, Nick?

01:00:46.543 --> 01:00:48.678
- That's enough, Nick.
- Sure.

01:00:53.682 --> 01:00:54.717
Come on.

01:00:56.252 --> 01:00:58.720
Come here. Give me a hug.

01:00:58.722 --> 01:01:01.225
Come on. We'll save
a fortune in therapy.

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:05.395
Hmm?

01:01:06.895 --> 01:01:08.031
Come on. Give me a hug.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:12.866
There you go, huh, hoss?

01:01:12.868 --> 01:01:15.770
You've just always got to make
a spectacle out of everything.

01:01:15.772 --> 01:01:17.572
There you go.

01:01:17.574 --> 01:01:19.042
Yeah, pretty much.

01:01:20.243 --> 01:01:22.779
All right, Nick.
I think it's time to go.

01:01:24.013 --> 01:01:25.281
Come on, Nick, let's go.

01:01:28.718 --> 01:01:30.917
Call the fucking cops.
That's what I'm saying.

01:01:30.919 --> 01:01:33.421
- Call the fucking cops.
- I'm sorry, but it's time for you to go.

01:01:33.423 --> 01:01:34.756
Call the cops.

01:01:34.758 --> 01:01:37.390
- I'm sorry...
- Don't fucking touch me.

01:01:37.392 --> 01:01:40.026
- I'm sorry.
- Do not fucking touch me.

01:01:40.028 --> 01:01:42.065
- Come on, Nick.
- Just, please go.

01:01:56.278 --> 01:01:57.981
Take your time.

01:02:05.053 --> 01:02:07.825
What happened to you?

01:02:15.964 --> 01:02:17.934
Borracho, what do you think?

01:02:19.002 --> 01:02:20.968
What the fuck was that?

01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:22.270
You spotted me at the gym?

01:02:22.272 --> 01:02:23.907
<i>Tranquillo.</i> All right?

01:02:26.308 --> 01:02:27.977
Sit down.

01:02:31.314 --> 01:02:33.314
I'll take it, Freddy.

01:02:33.316 --> 01:02:35.587
Just give us a minute, okay?

01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:41.657
Look, they're not going to off
you with this much heat, okay?

01:02:43.325 --> 01:02:44.794
When's this happening?

01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:46.498
Friday.

01:02:47.462 --> 01:02:49.263
Where?

01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:51.468
I don't know yet.
All I can tell you is Friday.

01:02:52.167 --> 01:02:53.834
TGIF, huh?

01:02:53.836 --> 01:02:55.606
You're protecting me on this.

01:02:56.205 --> 01:02:57.441
<i>Fräulein,</i>

01:02:59.174 --> 01:03:00.310
we got your back, bro.

01:03:01.478 --> 01:03:03.147
Don't worry about a thing.

01:03:05.682 --> 01:03:06.884
Fuck.

01:03:09.319 --> 01:03:11.154
Better wear your vest.

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:13.323
We're in.

01:08:33.042 --> 01:08:35.843
Z?

01:08:35.845 --> 01:08:38.546
Pico Rivera Savings,
Montebello Town Center.

01:08:38.548 --> 01:08:40.313
<i>Copy that, boss.
See you at 0800.</i>

01:08:40.314 --> 01:08:41.649
Tell the crew.

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:48.823
I did what you told me to.

01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:47.911
There you go.
Good job there.

01:10:55.450 --> 01:10:56.685
McKenna!

01:11:04.327 --> 01:11:08.028
Hey, sweetie. Hey, sweetie.

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:11.098
How are you? Good?

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.269
What are you doing?

01:11:13.468 --> 01:11:16.135
Well, you know,
I was on my way to work

01:11:16.137 --> 01:11:19.840
and thought I'd come by and say
hello to my little monkey.

01:11:19.842 --> 01:11:21.709
Is that okay?

01:11:21.711 --> 01:11:23.876
How's everything
at school? Okay?

01:11:23.878 --> 01:11:25.714
- Yes, it's good.
- Yeah?

01:11:27.115 --> 01:11:29.551
And what about Auntie's house?

01:11:29.553 --> 01:11:31.354
Mommy and Cassady,
are they good?

01:11:37.959 --> 01:11:39.859
What about the honey-bear?
Honey-bear good?

01:11:39.861 --> 01:11:42.031
Yeah? You miss me?

01:11:47.069 --> 01:11:50.136
All right, Pookie,
better get back to class.

01:11:50.138 --> 01:11:52.139
When am I going
to see you again?

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:55.812
Soon, sweetheart.
I'm gonna see you soon.

01:11:57.646 --> 01:11:59.482
I want to come home.

01:12:02.351 --> 01:12:03.687
Me, too.

01:12:05.221 --> 01:12:07.924
All right, you better
get back to class, okay?

01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:10.327
But I'm gonna see you later.

01:12:11.226 --> 01:12:12.361
Promise?

01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:16.700
I promise.

01:12:18.767 --> 01:12:20.603
Come on.

01:12:23.739 --> 01:12:27.243
Recess is over.
Come on, kids. Come line up.

01:12:28.444 --> 01:12:30.046
Go on, Pookie.

01:12:30.713 --> 01:12:32.112
Bye, Daddy.

01:12:32.114 --> 01:12:33.450
Come on, McKenna.

01:12:35.717 --> 01:12:37.252
Come on, honey.

01:13:52.328 --> 01:13:53.930
Jock up.

01:14:01.803 --> 01:14:03.306
Tac up, brother.

01:14:06.509 --> 01:14:08.542
No Fed?

01:14:08.544 --> 01:14:10.212
Change of plans.

01:14:11.881 --> 01:14:13.947
Pay attention.

01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:15.718
Always keep your finger off the trigger
until you're going to shoot somebody.

01:14:17.386 --> 01:14:20.687
If and when that happens,
safety selector switch.

01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:22.526
One for semi,
two for full auto.

01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:43.242
Mag release.

01:14:43.244 --> 01:14:45.344
Out with the old,
in with the new.

01:14:45.346 --> 01:14:47.582
Tug it. Make sure
it's in there good.

01:14:47.584 --> 01:14:50.183
Slap the bolt home,
you're ready for round two.

01:14:50.185 --> 01:14:53.252
Other than that, keep this thing
pointed at the fucking floor.

01:14:53.254 --> 01:14:54.592
- You understand?
- Got it.

01:14:56.324 --> 01:14:57.327
Go put your shit on.

01:15:19.013 --> 01:15:21.417
- Magazine, Borracho?
- Yeah.

01:15:52.647 --> 01:15:54.784
- We good?
- We good.

01:16:30.985 --> 01:16:33.019
Suspects arriving on location.

01:16:33.021 --> 01:16:35.287
We've got nothing for the DA. They
haven't committed a crime yet.

01:16:35.289 --> 01:16:37.424
<i>They clear the bank,
we take them down.</i>

01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:39.028
- <i>Stand by.</i>
- Roger that.

01:16:49.606 --> 01:16:51.470
Broad fucking daylight.

01:16:51.472 --> 01:16:52.674
They're packing big.

01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:58.647
Ooh, shit. Look at these
motherfuckers.

01:17:03.851 --> 01:17:06.019
Get down on the ground!
Get down on the ground!

01:17:06.021 --> 01:17:08.487
Down on the ground! Get
down on the fucking ground!

01:17:08.489 --> 01:17:09.556
Freeze!

01:17:09.558 --> 01:17:11.157
Freeze! Don't move!
Stay right there!

01:17:11.159 --> 01:17:12.194
Freeze!

01:17:13.061 --> 01:17:14.394
Freeze!

01:17:14.396 --> 01:17:16.328
- You two! Move! Get over there!
- Get over here!

01:17:16.330 --> 01:17:18.200
Hurry up!

01:17:20.069 --> 01:17:21.902
Get out here, now!

01:17:21.904 --> 01:17:25.208
Move there now! Go! Go! Go!

01:17:26.374 --> 01:17:29.177
Move back!
Stay right there! Now!

01:17:30.412 --> 01:17:32.181
Eyes to the floor!

01:17:35.217 --> 01:17:36.849
Listen up!

01:17:36.851 --> 01:17:38.984
Everybody pay the fuck
attention!

01:17:38.986 --> 01:17:40.420
Eyes to the ground!

01:17:40.422 --> 01:17:42.656
'Cause I'm only
going to say this once!

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:45.826
If you cooperate,
if you follow directions,

01:17:45.828 --> 01:17:49.895
you will not be hurt. We are
here for money, not for you.

01:17:49.897 --> 01:17:51.997
I want everybody lined up
on the counter. Let's go!

01:17:51.999 --> 01:17:53.269
Move down!

01:17:54.002 --> 01:17:55.536
Move down! Let's go!

01:17:55.538 --> 01:17:58.404
Everybody behind the counter,
come out front! Let's go!

01:17:58.406 --> 01:18:01.209
Keep your eyes down
and your mouths shut.

01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:04.111
On my command,

01:18:04.113 --> 01:18:08.215
reach inside your pockets,
remove your cell phones,

01:18:08.217 --> 01:18:10.951
and put your hands in the air.

01:18:10.953 --> 01:18:13.455
Everybody take
two steps forward.

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:17.126
Now go down on your knees.

01:18:20.028 --> 01:18:21.963
All right! Cell phones
right in here.

01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:23.530
On me.

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:24.764
Let's go.
Put them in the box.

01:18:24.766 --> 01:18:25.967
Tie them up.

01:18:28.538 --> 01:18:30.604
Go! Go! Go!

01:18:30.606 --> 01:18:32.773
There will be
no heroics today.

01:18:32.775 --> 01:18:35.308
You guys go ahead
and get comfortable.

01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:37.243
We're going to
be here for a while.

01:18:37.245 --> 01:18:39.414
Anybody need to
use the bathroom?

01:18:40.583 --> 01:18:42.118
Take a piss on yourself.

01:18:50.593 --> 01:18:51.627
Hey.

01:18:58.132 --> 01:19:00.635
You. Get up.

01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:02.972
Stop.

01:19:07.241 --> 01:19:08.579
Sit down.

01:19:14.348 --> 01:19:15.648
All right, I need you
to calm down right now.

01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:18.120
Hey! Look at me.

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:20.490
Take a deep breath.

01:19:23.659 --> 01:19:25.192
Good.

01:19:25.194 --> 01:19:27.827
I know you already triggered
the silent alarms.

01:19:27.829 --> 01:19:29.696
So I need you
to pick up the phone,

01:19:29.698 --> 01:19:33.666
dial 911 dispatch,
and explain the following.

01:19:33.668 --> 01:19:35.337
Go ahead and write this down.

01:19:37.105 --> 01:19:41.609
There's a 211 in progress,
and we have hostages.

01:19:41.611 --> 01:19:44.376
Within one hour, they need
to deliver $10 million

01:19:44.378 --> 01:19:47.680
in unmarked small denomination
bills to this bank

01:19:47.682 --> 01:19:50.716
inside a department helicopter
loaded with fuel.

01:19:50.718 --> 01:19:55.287
Tell them we plan on killing one hostage
every hour until our demands are met.

01:19:55.289 --> 01:19:57.489
No cops are to
approach the bank.

01:19:57.491 --> 01:20:00.693
And if a negotiator
even tries to contact us,

01:20:00.695 --> 01:20:02.864
we will automatically kill
another hostage.

01:20:04.232 --> 01:20:06.702
Is that clear?
You got it all?

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:11.307
Go ahead
and pick up the phone.

01:20:16.912 --> 01:20:19.312
<i>Any available units,
we have a bank 211 in progress...</i>

01:20:19.314 --> 01:20:20.647
Shit.

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:21.814
<i>...at the Pico Rivera Savings
in Montebello</i>

01:20:21.816 --> 01:20:25.218
<i>at 2891 Wilcox and Atlantic.</i>

01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:26.819
- <i>Suspects are armed...</i>
- What the fuck?

01:20:26.821 --> 01:20:28.889
<i>...and have taken hostages
and are refusing a negotiator.</i>

01:20:28.891 --> 01:20:31.358
What the fuck is going on?
That's not their MO.

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:34.760
Call in, tell them we're on scene,
have suspects under surveillance,

01:20:34.762 --> 01:20:36.328
and to back the fuck off.

01:20:36.330 --> 01:20:39.600
This is LASD, we have surveillance
on the bank. Stand down.

01:20:39.602 --> 01:20:43.036
I repeat,
have all units stand down.

01:20:43.038 --> 01:20:44.938
It's bullshit. I can
hear them already.

01:20:46.208 --> 01:20:47.276
What the fuck are they doing?

01:20:53.181 --> 01:20:54.380
Stop!

01:20:54.382 --> 01:20:55.684
Get out!

01:21:07.562 --> 01:21:09.599
What the fuck
are you guys doing, huh?

01:21:11.199 --> 01:21:12.533
Asshole!

01:21:12.535 --> 01:21:14.401
What the fuck are you doing?
What's going on?

01:21:14.403 --> 01:21:16.368
You were running surveillance,
and you let this shit go down?

01:21:16.370 --> 01:21:19.438
It's our fucking case. We've been
surveilling these guys for weeks.

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:20.773
That's what surveillance is!

01:21:20.775 --> 01:21:23.443
They commit a crime,
and then we stop them.

01:21:23.445 --> 01:21:24.780
Go. Go to the vault.

01:21:25.646 --> 01:21:26.748
Open it.

01:21:41.629 --> 01:21:43.098
Let's go. Come.

01:21:46.435 --> 01:21:47.770
Sit. Sit down.

01:21:55.243 --> 01:21:57.810
I'm going to put this
on speaker phone.

01:21:57.812 --> 01:21:59.312
You're going to answer,
but don't use any names.

01:21:59.314 --> 01:22:00.616
You understand?

01:22:04.352 --> 01:22:05.618
Hello?

01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:07.987
<i>Hello, this is the Los Angeles
Police Department.</i>

01:22:07.989 --> 01:22:09.755
<i>Who am I speaking with?</i>

01:22:09.757 --> 01:22:11.157
This is the branch manager.

01:22:11.159 --> 01:22:13.158
<i>Sir, I need to speak
with the person in charge.</i>

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:15.094
You are.

01:22:15.096 --> 01:22:18.297
<i>Okay, good. Well, let me introduce myself.
I'm Officer Parada...</i>

01:22:18.299 --> 01:22:23.336
I don't give a fuck who you are.
Are our demands being met?

01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:24.470
<i>Who am I talking with now?</i>

01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:26.005
Answer the question.

01:22:26.007 --> 01:22:27.706
It's being worked on
as we speak.

01:22:27.708 --> 01:22:28.942
<i>But you need to understand...</i>

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:30.178
You just killed a hostage.

01:22:31.512 --> 01:22:33.015
God damn it!

01:22:39.687 --> 01:22:42.488
- Get up. Get up!
- No! No! No!

01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:44.189
Come on, move!

01:22:44.191 --> 01:22:46.560
I didn't do anything. Please.
What are you doing?

01:22:46.562 --> 01:22:51.033
- Come on.
- No! No! No!

01:22:55.369 --> 01:22:56.502
Fuck!

01:22:56.504 --> 01:22:58.371
- You were on it, huh?
- Shit!

01:22:58.373 --> 01:22:59.805
You're so full of shit,
O'Brien...

01:22:59.807 --> 01:23:01.707
You heard the demands,
you stupid motherfucker!

01:23:01.709 --> 01:23:04.877
- Yeah.
- You put a negotiator on? Christ!

01:23:04.879 --> 01:23:06.379
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?

01:23:06.381 --> 01:23:07.547
Yeah, fuck you!

01:23:07.549 --> 01:23:09.515
Fucking nice haircut,
you fucking idiot.

01:23:09.517 --> 01:23:10.983
Who are you
fucking pushing now?

01:23:10.985 --> 01:23:12.352
Are you fucking kidding?

01:23:12.354 --> 01:23:14.487
- Get SWAT rolling right now!
- You fucking pussy.

01:23:14.489 --> 01:23:16.221
Fucking Lobbin' Bob is angry!

01:23:16.223 --> 01:23:18.559
- All right, boss, let's go. Let's go.
- Shitheads!

01:23:18.561 --> 01:23:20.660
- Let's go.
- Fuck!

01:23:20.662 --> 01:23:22.228
We've got a situation
going on...

01:23:22.230 --> 01:23:23.265
Shit!

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:27.236
What the fuck are you
doing, Merrimen?

01:23:38.413 --> 01:23:39.879
Yeah?

01:23:39.881 --> 01:23:42.381
This is the Police Department.
Please don't hang up.

01:23:42.383 --> 01:23:44.084
My name's Danny,

01:23:44.086 --> 01:23:46.419
I'll be your only contact. Nobody
else is going to call you.

01:23:46.421 --> 01:23:48.420
<i>Is this the person in charge?</i>

01:23:48.422 --> 01:23:50.189
This is the branch manager.

01:23:50.191 --> 01:23:53.760
I'm speaking on the
man in charge's behalf.

01:23:53.762 --> 01:23:55.761
<i>Do you have a name,
branch manager?</i>

01:23:57.431 --> 01:24:00.902
Listen. They've already killed
one of the hostages. A woman.

01:24:02.104 --> 01:24:04.103
They will not
speak to you again.

01:24:04.105 --> 01:24:07.608
If you call back again before their
demands are met, they'll kill another.

01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:09.609
Just send what they want.

01:24:09.611 --> 01:24:11.578
<i>The money and the chopper
are en route,</i>

01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:13.246
<i>but it's going to take
a little bit of time.</i>

01:24:13.248 --> 01:24:16.485
<i>You need to give me at least
90 minutes. Is this doable?</i>

01:24:18.753 --> 01:24:20.756
Okay. Don't call back.

01:24:46.013 --> 01:24:47.279
What's the prefix here?

01:24:47.281 --> 01:24:48.617
562. It's Long Beach.

01:24:55.624 --> 01:24:57.322
Hello?

01:24:57.324 --> 01:24:58.527
You watching?

01:25:03.164 --> 01:25:04.165
Yup.

01:25:09.337 --> 01:25:11.272
So how the hell are you going
to get out of this one?

01:25:12.973 --> 01:25:14.476
Not sure yet.

01:25:18.614 --> 01:25:20.816
Did you get my number
from her cell?

01:25:27.623 --> 01:25:29.225
I ain't cuffing up.

01:25:31.825 --> 01:25:33.462
That's okay.

01:25:34.863 --> 01:25:37.399
I didn't bring
my cuffs anyway.

01:25:39.133 --> 01:25:40.869
Yeah, I can see that.

01:26:01.222 --> 01:26:02.757
Was that who I think it was?

01:26:03.424 --> 01:26:04.593
Yup.

01:26:11.732 --> 01:26:13.265
We've got a chopper
that's gonna come down.

01:26:13.267 --> 01:26:14.936
The chopper is going to land
right over here.

01:26:23.043 --> 01:26:27.282
I've got two-door entry on one.
One-door entry on two.

01:26:28.917 --> 01:26:29.919
Breaching!

01:26:36.958 --> 01:26:38.595
Well, they just
blew the vault.

01:26:39.261 --> 01:26:40.629
What the fuck?

01:26:51.071 --> 01:26:52.438
<i>Federal Reserve,
accounts receiving.</i>

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:54.273
Hey, it's Al at Alameda.

01:26:54.275 --> 01:26:56.943
We have a drop at Pico Rivera
we need to schedule.

01:26:56.945 --> 01:26:58.911
<i>How's Wednesday at 2:00?</i>

01:26:58.913 --> 01:27:01.281
<i>That works. You're confirmed
for 2:00 p.m. the 18th.</i>

01:27:01.283 --> 01:27:03.483
<i>Great. Thanks.</i>

01:27:03.485 --> 01:27:05.054
- We're here, yeah?
- Yeah, that's us.

01:27:06.288 --> 01:27:07.656
So what is this?

01:27:08.624 --> 01:27:10.156
This is the sewer line,

01:27:10.158 --> 01:27:12.928
and according to this map right
here, it's all cemented up.

01:27:33.147 --> 01:27:34.482
Hey, where are we
with the chopper?

01:27:35.316 --> 01:27:37.483
We're waiting on clearance.

01:27:37.485 --> 01:27:39.484
Relax, they're not
going anywhere.

01:27:39.486 --> 01:27:42.822
To hell with clearance.
We've got to move.

01:27:42.824 --> 01:27:44.260
O'Brien, hey!

01:27:45.659 --> 01:27:48.327
Is he off his meds?

01:27:48.329 --> 01:27:50.330
Tell him to get
the fuck back here!

01:27:50.332 --> 01:27:51.831
Will you shut the fuck up?

01:27:51.833 --> 01:27:53.002
Oh, fuck you.

01:28:03.177 --> 01:28:05.711
We better go back him up.

01:28:05.713 --> 01:28:07.279
Nick's heading to the front.
We're on the move.

01:28:07.281 --> 01:28:08.284
Here we go.

01:28:13.954 --> 01:28:15.957
- Fuck!
- Is he serious?

01:28:39.213 --> 01:28:40.546
Everybody okay?

01:28:40.548 --> 01:28:41.883
Yes.

01:28:47.721 --> 01:28:52.258
Please, Lord, please,
let me see my family again.

01:29:07.409 --> 01:29:08.410
- Nick!
- Sheriff's Department.

01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:11.077
Nick!

01:29:11.079 --> 01:29:12.114
Clear!

01:29:15.382 --> 01:29:16.751
Clear!

01:29:24.391 --> 01:29:26.596
- The fuck?
- Nick, what's your location?

01:29:30.464 --> 01:29:31.766
<i>What's your location?</i>

01:29:40.275 --> 01:29:42.442
Hey, this is Al
at Alameda again.

01:29:42.444 --> 01:29:44.977
I forgot to schedule a drop
at the Pico Rivera Savings.

01:29:44.979 --> 01:29:46.616
What do you have open today?

01:29:54.155 --> 01:29:56.656
<i>Ghetto Bird, this is Silverback.
We confirmed?</i>

01:29:56.658 --> 01:30:00.128
Check. Appointment's at 2:45.
That's in two minutes.

01:30:14.007 --> 01:30:15.276
Pico Rivera.

01:30:23.952 --> 01:30:25.818
Horsepower all set?

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:27.322
<i>Yeah, I'm ready to go.</i>

01:30:41.636 --> 01:30:43.169
They got you
on a new route?

01:30:43.171 --> 01:30:46.037
Yeah. Yeah, they just
switched us over this week.

01:30:46.039 --> 01:30:49.774
All right. Let me
get you guys' IDs, man.

01:30:49.776 --> 01:30:52.513
Yeah, sure. There you go.

01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:01.522
All right.

01:31:02.356 --> 01:31:03.855
You're good to go.

01:31:03.857 --> 01:31:06.028
- All right, thank you.
- Open the gate. Have a good one.

01:31:47.534 --> 01:31:48.537
Oh, fuck.

01:31:58.713 --> 01:32:01.080
Pico Rivera Savings? 2.2?

01:32:01.082 --> 01:32:02.582
Yup, that's us.

01:32:02.584 --> 01:32:03.950
Bring her up.

01:32:03.952 --> 01:32:05.921
All right, ready.
One, two, three.

01:32:13.226 --> 01:32:15.229
- Sign here.
- You got it.

01:32:16.565 --> 01:32:17.900
You're new here, Mark?

01:32:18.932 --> 01:32:20.135
Yes, sir.

01:32:22.369 --> 01:32:23.803
You guys running
a little bit late.

01:32:23.805 --> 01:32:26.909
Yeah, we ran into
some traffic, so...

01:32:28.611 --> 01:32:30.242
I don't know where they had
you guys routed before,

01:32:30.244 --> 01:32:32.546
but we run a tight, tight ship
around here,

01:32:32.548 --> 01:32:34.947
so, if you're going to be
late, have base call it in.

01:32:34.949 --> 01:32:36.415
Yeah, no problem.
That's my fault. I just...

01:32:36.417 --> 01:32:38.787
Just have them call.

01:32:39.787 --> 01:32:40.923
On me.

01:33:19.793 --> 01:33:22.495
Hey, Luigi. Alameda's on deck.
Check them in.

01:33:22.497 --> 01:33:23.664
Copy that.

01:33:24.164 --> 01:33:25.466
New guys.

01:33:26.633 --> 01:33:28.302
I'm going to
step out for a minute.

01:33:55.696 --> 01:33:57.028
How you guys doing today?

01:33:57.030 --> 01:33:58.833
- Good. All right.
- Good.

01:34:04.739 --> 01:34:05.904
How you doing?

01:34:05.906 --> 01:34:08.541
- All right, how are you?
- Good, thank you.

01:34:08.543 --> 01:34:10.078
Sign that for me, please.

01:34:12.713 --> 01:34:14.714
All hundreds?

01:34:14.716 --> 01:34:17.519
The first one's all hundreds.
The second one is mixed.

01:34:18.519 --> 01:34:19.984
We're a little backed up.

01:34:19.986 --> 01:34:21.555
All right, do what you can.

01:34:21.557 --> 01:34:23.822
Guys want to hang out, get a Coke
or something? Appreciate you.

01:34:23.824 --> 01:34:24.825
Thank you.

01:34:35.369 --> 01:34:37.702
We're going to need access
to the recording off-site.

01:34:37.704 --> 01:34:39.404
Can you get that to us?

01:34:39.406 --> 01:34:41.376
- Understood.
- You need professional help.

01:34:42.110 --> 01:34:43.242
Desperately.

01:34:43.244 --> 01:34:45.914
My bad last time.
Your crime scene.

01:35:13.074 --> 01:35:16.108
Silverback, this
is Horsepower. I'm in.

01:35:16.110 --> 01:35:19.647
Greenpeace, this is Silverback.
Horsepower is in.

01:35:21.414 --> 01:35:23.784
Roger that, Silverback.
Lights out.

01:35:31.958 --> 01:35:33.494
Okay, here we go.

01:35:36.597 --> 01:35:38.964
Johnny, we're fucking brown
again, man.

01:35:38.966 --> 01:35:41.069
Got to shut down. Pull them
out of the count rooms.

01:35:42.169 --> 01:35:44.636
We're going brown.

01:35:44.638 --> 01:35:47.007
We've got to shut down for a bit.
All teams go ahead and take 10.

01:35:57.251 --> 01:35:58.317
Luigi, come on.

01:35:58.319 --> 01:36:00.689
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:36:13.467 --> 01:36:15.337
They went to brown.
They're clearing out.

01:36:17.538 --> 01:36:19.107
- Let's lock it down.
- Copy.

01:36:24.811 --> 01:36:26.147
Get ready to go.

01:36:38.726 --> 01:36:40.195
<i>Powering up EMP now.</i>

01:36:46.633 --> 01:36:47.867
All clear here.

01:36:47.869 --> 01:36:48.870
Good to go.

01:36:52.006 --> 01:36:53.240
You're clear. Go.

01:37:01.315 --> 01:37:02.982
Shit. Check something out.

01:37:02.984 --> 01:37:04.550
What do you think it is?

01:37:04.553 --> 01:37:06.221
Are the cameras up
in the 100 room?

01:37:06.988 --> 01:37:08.722
Uh, negative.

01:37:14.262 --> 01:37:16.428
555-0143.

01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:17.567
It's taking too long.

01:37:18.599 --> 01:37:19.898
Tasty Orders.

01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:21.233
<i>This is Sharon at the Fed.</i>

01:37:21.235 --> 01:37:23.501
<i>Now, we ordered almost
an hour and a half ago.</i>

01:37:23.503 --> 01:37:25.371
<i>Now, I only have so much time
on my lunch break.</i>

01:37:25.373 --> 01:37:27.573
It coming!
Be there in a few minute!

01:37:27.575 --> 01:37:29.174
They just called
for the Chinese.

01:37:29.176 --> 01:37:30.278
<i>Hurry it up.</i>

01:37:33.713 --> 01:37:35.447
Motion is out in there, too.

01:37:35.449 --> 01:37:36.751
Yeah, man, we're still brown.

01:37:38.852 --> 01:37:41.420
You know, we better override.
Power it up.

01:37:41.422 --> 01:37:42.424
All right.

01:37:44.792 --> 01:37:45.890
Done.

01:37:45.892 --> 01:37:47.462
Okay. Better get
that count, too.

01:37:59.373 --> 01:38:01.941
Shit, here comes security.
Get down. Get down.

01:38:01.943 --> 01:38:04.614
Hey, man, we got to check this 100 count.
Motion went off.

01:38:12.485 --> 01:38:13.786
Luigi...

01:38:13.788 --> 01:38:15.290
Step on it.
Step on it, quick.

01:38:17.592 --> 01:38:18.724
Yeah?

01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:20.158
- Luigi.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:23.429
Damn, dude! Luigi, you're
stepping on the line, man!

01:38:23.431 --> 01:38:25.096
Say again? Russell?

01:38:25.098 --> 01:38:27.769
Hey, dumb-dumb. You've got to
let go of the push to talk.

01:38:30.637 --> 01:38:32.439
What the hell is
going on here today?

01:38:35.943 --> 01:38:37.309
<i>Luigi, man. He's stepping
all over the line.</i>

01:38:37.311 --> 01:38:38.810
<i>He's</i> hot-micing
<i>like a motherfucker.</i>

01:38:38.812 --> 01:38:41.346
He's in the cafeteria.
Go ahead and get him.

01:38:41.348 --> 01:38:43.318
<i>All right. Roger that.
I'm stepping out.</i>

01:38:52.025 --> 01:38:53.260
You're clear. Go.

01:39:01.502 --> 01:39:02.504
Holy shit.

01:39:40.074 --> 01:39:41.874
Luigi, you're hot-micing.

01:39:41.876 --> 01:39:43.809
You've got to let go of the talk button.
You're stepping on the line.

01:39:43.811 --> 01:39:45.810
Dude, it's not me.

01:39:45.812 --> 01:39:48.380
Come on, we've got to check the 100 count.
Let's go. Get Junior. Let's go.

01:39:48.382 --> 01:39:50.049
<i>Switch to line five.</i>

01:39:50.051 --> 01:39:51.886
You got about a minute and a
half, two minutes. Let's go.

01:40:20.748 --> 01:40:21.850
They're back. Get out.

01:41:01.321 --> 01:41:03.388
Luigi, you see anything, man?

01:41:03.390 --> 01:41:05.323
Yeah, we're good. There's
nothing back there but dust.

01:41:05.325 --> 01:41:07.259
What am I looking for?

01:41:07.261 --> 01:41:08.894
Don't worry about it, man. I'm gonna
juice up the room. Run the count,

01:41:08.896 --> 01:41:10.765
- <i>and make sure we're good, all right?</i>
- Copy that.

01:41:11.765 --> 01:41:13.965
Where are you?

01:41:13.967 --> 01:41:15.836
This is Horsepower.
I'm in the vents.

01:41:22.909 --> 01:41:24.612
Greenpeace, you're done.
Cut out.

01:41:28.082 --> 01:41:30.681
We are back up, brother.

01:41:30.683 --> 01:41:32.854
All teams,
back to the count room.

01:41:35.321 --> 01:41:36.955
Get on with LAPD Central.

01:41:36.957 --> 01:41:40.091
Tell them we're running
surveillance at 8th and Grand.

01:41:40.093 --> 01:41:43.161
<i>Request a Code 5. We do not
wanna spook the suspects.</i>

01:41:43.163 --> 01:41:44.998
<i>Copy that.
Putting in a Code 5.</i>

01:41:47.333 --> 01:41:50.135
Am I tripping or
was this full before?

01:41:50.137 --> 01:41:51.506
Let's just check the count.

01:42:21.467 --> 01:42:22.537
$712,200.

01:42:24.572 --> 01:42:26.007
$712,200.

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.310
Russell, the count is on.

01:42:30.878 --> 01:42:33.144
All right, roger that. Go
ahead and clock out Alameda.

01:42:33.146 --> 01:42:34.548
Take Alameda out.

01:42:56.736 --> 01:42:58.536
The count was good.

01:42:58.538 --> 01:43:00.706
But both of your bins
were half-full.

01:43:00.708 --> 01:43:02.374
Sorry?

01:43:02.376 --> 01:43:04.244
Your bins,
they were half-full.

01:43:05.614 --> 01:43:07.045
That's how we got them.

01:43:07.047 --> 01:43:10.849
Next time, just put it
in a cash sack.

01:43:10.851 --> 01:43:12.550
Makes things a lot easier.

01:43:12.552 --> 01:43:14.853
Try and work smart, not hard.

01:43:14.855 --> 01:43:16.089
Okay, sounds good.
Thanks for the advice.

01:45:04.397 --> 01:45:08.200
We would tip you, honey, but that
just took too damn long, okay?

01:45:08.202 --> 01:45:10.204
I'm the only guy they've got
delivering today. I'm sorry.

01:45:36.730 --> 01:45:39.100
Sorry, guys, let me see
your drop confirmation again.

01:45:41.001 --> 01:45:42.270
- All right.
- There you go.

01:45:58.685 --> 01:46:00.254
Chinese food guy?

01:46:00.954 --> 01:46:02.523
Go on. Buzz him in.

01:46:07.927 --> 01:46:09.062
Hold him there.

01:46:12.266 --> 01:46:13.401
2-4-5.

01:46:20.239 --> 01:46:21.576
Yeah, send him through.

01:46:24.378 --> 01:46:26.881
Come here for a sec, buddy.

01:46:29.616 --> 01:46:31.452
Yeah, man, I don't
have you signed in.

01:46:35.388 --> 01:46:37.221
Where's your name?

01:46:37.223 --> 01:46:40.291
Come on, man, I signed my name with
a dude from the last shift, man.

01:46:40.293 --> 01:46:41.561
I don't know what to tell you.

01:46:45.332 --> 01:46:46.430
Mmm-mmm.

01:46:46.432 --> 01:46:48.136
Damn you finicky.

01:46:49.269 --> 01:46:50.734
- I'm getting my money back.
- Okay.

01:46:50.736 --> 01:46:52.804
- I'm getting my money back.
- Okay.

01:46:52.806 --> 01:46:53.808
That's all I need.

01:46:59.178 --> 01:47:01.145
All right, you boys
are good to go.

01:47:01.147 --> 01:47:02.680
- Thank you very much, Officer.
- Take it easy.

01:47:02.682 --> 01:47:04.185
- You have a good day.
- All right.

01:47:10.857 --> 01:47:13.160
- Go on. Get out of here.
- Thank you.

01:47:16.797 --> 01:47:18.599
Yes, security in
the lobby, please.

01:47:27.874 --> 01:47:29.006
Lobby.

01:47:29.008 --> 01:47:31.009
Yeah, did you see
a delivery guy?

01:47:31.011 --> 01:47:33.381
Red shirt, light skin.
About 6 foot.

01:47:34.815 --> 01:47:36.884
- Wait, what?
- Stop him.

01:47:41.288 --> 01:47:44.192
You got eyes on the 1-2 side?
We'll cover the 3-4 corner.

01:47:45.191 --> 01:47:46.660
Copy that.

01:47:59.006 --> 01:48:01.206
Got held up at security.
What's your location?

01:48:01.208 --> 01:48:04.075
South on Grand,
just past Vernon.

01:48:04.077 --> 01:48:06.711
<i>Go right on Gage.
Right on Gage.</i>

01:48:06.713 --> 01:48:07.748
Copy that.

01:48:29.002 --> 01:48:30.902
Move! Let's go! Get out!

01:48:30.904 --> 01:48:33.371
- Come on, move! Move! Here we go!
- It's cool.

01:48:33.373 --> 01:48:34.942
- Come on, get down! Go! Go! Go!
- It's cool. I'm cool, man.

01:48:35.610 --> 01:48:36.944
Be cool, bro. Cool.

01:48:38.678 --> 01:48:40.080
Fuck.

01:48:59.466 --> 01:49:01.232
There he is. There he is.
Red shirt. Two blocks ahead.

01:49:01.234 --> 01:49:03.033
Eyes on suspect.

01:49:03.035 --> 01:49:07.138
Walking eastbound on 9th, approaching
Hill, south side of street.

01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:09.573
Pull up in front of him,
in front of him.

01:49:09.575 --> 01:49:11.209
Let's get this motherfucker.

01:49:11.211 --> 01:49:12.812
Let's ram his bitch-ass
into the gate first.

01:49:15.616 --> 01:49:18.084
Get in the fucking car!
Come on. Get in.

01:49:19.886 --> 01:49:21.155
Fuck.

01:49:21.623 --> 01:49:22.722
Hit him!

01:49:31.664 --> 01:49:33.734
Motherfucker.

01:49:50.417 --> 01:49:52.820
All right, let's go. Let's go. Let's
get it done as quick as we can.

01:49:57.958 --> 01:49:59.924
Little fuck.

01:49:59.926 --> 01:50:02.363
Where is he?
Where the fuck is he, asshole?

01:50:03.329 --> 01:50:04.332
Fuck.

01:50:06.999 --> 01:50:08.868
<i>Fucking... Fucker!</i>

01:50:10.803 --> 01:50:13.673
Give me the burner phone.
Where the fuck is he?

01:50:17.944 --> 01:50:20.111
Pacific Horizon Salvage.

01:50:20.113 --> 01:50:22.650
In South Gate.
That's the rally point.

01:50:31.958 --> 01:50:33.825
Silverback, go.

01:50:33.827 --> 01:50:35.363
<i>Horsepower's burned.</i>

01:50:37.329 --> 01:50:38.830
Repeat that. I can't hear you.

01:50:38.832 --> 01:50:41.032
Horsepower is burned.

01:50:41.034 --> 01:50:42.670
<i>He's done.</i>

01:50:44.037 --> 01:50:45.839
I'm still clean.
Where am I going, bro?

01:51:05.424 --> 01:51:07.325
Fuck!

01:51:07.327 --> 01:51:09.260
Let's go. Let's go.
You guys got it all?

01:51:09.262 --> 01:51:10.894
- Yes, it's all in.
- Pick it up.

01:51:10.896 --> 01:51:11.899
It's good.

01:51:13.999 --> 01:51:17.935
Pacific Horizon Salvage.
South Gate, Alameda Corridor.

01:51:17.937 --> 01:51:19.507
10-4. Headed to you.

01:51:26.346 --> 01:51:27.580
What happened
to the other two?

01:51:31.784 --> 01:51:33.421
They got burned.

01:51:59.079 --> 01:52:00.444
Eyes on suspects.

01:52:00.446 --> 01:52:02.149
Black, four-door Suburban!

01:52:07.921 --> 01:52:09.789
Heading southbound on Alameda.

01:52:12.324 --> 01:52:16.563
Approaching Slauson Avenue. I need
you to parallel me on Santa Fe.

01:52:26.172 --> 01:52:28.007
We got some traffic up ahead.
What's going on?

01:52:29.275 --> 01:52:30.577
Corridor's backed up.

01:52:37.484 --> 01:52:40.120
We just turned down Alameda Corridor, heading south.

01:52:49.597 --> 01:52:50.698
Shit.

01:52:59.772 --> 01:53:01.773
Coming up on suspect,
six o'clock.

01:53:01.775 --> 01:53:03.174
Shit.

01:53:03.176 --> 01:53:05.343
Right lane is closed up ahead.

01:53:05.345 --> 01:53:08.481
<i>I repeat, right lane is
closed up ahead.</i>

01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:15.621
You guys see that?

01:53:15.623 --> 01:53:17.691
Twenty, 30 cars back.
What is that?

01:53:21.695 --> 01:53:22.963
Is that...

01:53:27.833 --> 01:53:29.869
Okay, we're at
a stop, stop, stop.

01:53:32.038 --> 01:53:33.707
Fuck backup.
We've got to move now.

01:53:34.574 --> 01:53:35.876
Fuck.

01:53:43.249 --> 01:53:44.350
Yup.

01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:51.723
That's them.

01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:59.663
- Give me my vest.
- Yeah.

01:53:59.665 --> 01:54:01.235
Yeah, here we go.

01:54:04.905 --> 01:54:07.404
Okay, we've got them pinched in. We've
got to move before it opens up.

01:54:07.406 --> 01:54:08.741
Cuff him up.

01:54:18.685 --> 01:54:21.251
Be advised, suspects wearing
body armor.

01:54:21.253 --> 01:54:24.054
No center mass shots.
Limb and head shots only.

01:54:24.056 --> 01:54:25.258
Copy that.
Go around right here.

01:54:30.030 --> 01:54:31.532
It's jammed up.

01:54:38.637 --> 01:54:40.640
Good? Okay, let's go.

01:54:51.551 --> 01:54:53.451
- Oh, shit.
- What?

01:54:53.453 --> 01:54:54.588
They're getting
out of the car.

01:55:00.493 --> 01:55:02.126
Z, go down the right.

01:55:02.128 --> 01:55:05.129
Gus, Borracho, center with me.

01:55:05.131 --> 01:55:07.735
Murph, stay on the left.
Don't come in.

01:55:08.635 --> 01:55:10.236
- Pass me the saw.
- Fuck.

01:55:12.638 --> 01:55:14.240
Let's go.

01:55:15.141 --> 01:55:16.310
Stay down. Stay down.

01:55:43.703 --> 01:55:45.039
Get down. Get down.

01:55:49.308 --> 01:55:51.311
- Sheriff's Department. Stay down.
- Get down. Get down.

01:55:58.885 --> 01:56:01.120
- Get down.
- Sheriff's Department, stay down.

01:56:04.289 --> 01:56:06.459
Get down. Get down.
Stay by the engine block.

01:56:09.796 --> 01:56:11.332
Get down behind the wheel.

01:56:18.872 --> 01:56:20.406
Sheriff's Department.
Lady, get in the car.

01:56:26.413 --> 01:56:27.513
Oh, shit.

01:56:30.216 --> 01:56:31.485
Borracho!

01:56:37.891 --> 01:56:38.926
Moving!

01:56:41.561 --> 01:56:42.563
Moving.

01:57:01.580 --> 01:57:05.416
Gus, Murph, you two go across
and cut them off, okay?

01:57:05.418 --> 01:57:07.855
Tony Z, you ready?

01:57:08.588 --> 01:57:09.923
Let's go.

01:57:32.712 --> 01:57:33.747
Moving!

01:57:38.619 --> 01:57:39.621
Move!

01:57:44.824 --> 01:57:47.061
Moving. Moving.

01:57:52.132 --> 01:57:53.500
Mag change!

01:58:00.105 --> 01:58:01.107
Moving.

01:58:06.111 --> 01:58:07.181
Mag change.

01:58:19.525 --> 01:58:20.526
Moving!

01:58:25.765 --> 01:58:26.999
Go! Go! Peel off!

01:58:37.342 --> 01:58:38.475
Tony, you okay?

01:58:38.477 --> 01:58:40.180
- Yeah, go! Go!
- You okay?

01:58:41.146 --> 01:58:42.149
Fuck!

01:58:47.186 --> 01:58:48.187
Go!

01:58:56.162 --> 01:58:57.164
Cover!

01:59:02.235 --> 01:59:03.237
Move.

01:59:13.346 --> 01:59:14.515
Fuck!

01:59:31.330 --> 01:59:32.763
Brick wall! Brick wall!

01:59:32.765 --> 01:59:34.234
Behind the brick building!

02:01:22.007 --> 02:01:23.441
My kids...

02:01:24.944 --> 02:01:26.446
You're in His hands now.

02:01:27.547 --> 02:01:28.848
You hear me?

02:02:18.431 --> 02:02:19.433
Fuck!

02:04:01.667 --> 02:04:02.869
Don't do it.

02:04:29.896 --> 02:04:31.528
Told you.

02:04:46.712 --> 02:04:48.647
Yeah. You did.

02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:53.312
What the fuck?

02:06:04.624 --> 02:06:05.824
You see this?

02:06:06.958 --> 02:06:08.294
Here. Do those.

02:06:13.466 --> 02:06:14.467
Oh, shit.

02:06:21.140 --> 02:06:24.477
So what? They were going to
make fucking snow globes?

02:06:25.645 --> 02:06:27.480
Like 10,000 of them?

02:06:36.689 --> 02:06:38.589
You check on the boys?

02:06:38.591 --> 02:06:40.660
Yeah, I'm going
to roll to the hospital.

02:06:45.330 --> 02:06:47.601
You gonna call
Borracho's wife?

02:06:56.275 --> 02:06:57.377
Yeah.

02:07:00.546 --> 02:07:02.015
All right.

02:07:04.150 --> 02:07:05.685
This won't go to Harbor.

02:07:24.637 --> 02:07:26.406
I'm sorry you lost
one of your guys.

02:07:28.373 --> 02:07:29.572
Thanks.

02:07:29.574 --> 02:07:31.041
You all right?

02:07:31.043 --> 02:07:32.479
Yeah, I'm okay.

02:07:33.878 --> 02:07:35.245
Yeah.

02:07:35.247 --> 02:07:38.418
Nick, you've got to stop
smoking, man.

02:07:39.217 --> 02:07:40.220
Here.

02:07:42.053 --> 02:07:43.422
It's organic.

02:07:51.896 --> 02:07:54.533
You know everything was accounted
for at the Fed, right?

02:07:56.936 --> 02:07:58.271
Apparently so.

02:09:28.860 --> 02:09:30.329
Hey, is Donnie around?

02:09:32.263 --> 02:09:33.333
He quit.

02:09:35.834 --> 02:09:37.436
So you haven't
seen him anywhere?

02:09:38.771 --> 02:09:40.340
I said he quit.

02:09:41.172 --> 02:09:42.374
Two days ago.

02:09:58.022 --> 02:09:59.359
You want a beer?

02:10:00.124 --> 02:10:03.026
Very much so. Like 50.

02:10:09.368 --> 02:10:11.070
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:10:25.818 --> 02:10:28.484
Did you see that new chick?
Little fat-ass?

02:10:28.486 --> 02:10:31.257
The new girl who
works down the hall?

02:10:32.391 --> 02:10:34.825
What's going on, gentlemen?

02:10:34.827 --> 02:10:36.827
- Gentlemen, good to see you.
- Yo!

02:10:36.829 --> 02:10:41.000
- Good to see you.
- Your wife know where you are?

02:10:56.414 --> 02:10:57.781
How did you get that job?

02:10:57.783 --> 02:10:59.084
Can you actually count?

02:11:00.753 --> 02:11:02.920
<i>I'm in complete
control of my environment.</i>

02:11:02.922 --> 02:11:04.022
People don't even know.

02:11:32.985 --> 02:11:34.721
Fucking <i>Fräulein.</i>

02:11:44.296 --> 02:11:46.330
What's going on, boys?

02:11:46.332 --> 02:11:47.667
How you doing? You good?

02:11:48.632 --> 02:11:49.801
Some beers?

02:11:50.302 --> 02:11:51.835
Hey, guv.

02:11:51.837 --> 02:11:53.439
A round of beers for my mates.

02:11:54.405 --> 02:11:56.139
And for you?

02:11:56.141 --> 02:11:57.143
I'm easy.

02:12:02.146 --> 02:12:03.315
I don't know.

02:12:03.848 --> 02:12:04.851
Surprise me.

02:12:07.986 --> 02:12:09.422
I can do that.

02:12:10.655 --> 02:12:12.324
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

02:12:13.324 --> 02:12:14.858
So why you come to me?

02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:16.526
You're a beast, man.

02:12:16.528 --> 02:12:18.094
Plus, you're the only one
that can pull this off.

02:12:18.096 --> 02:12:20.029
Listen.

02:12:20.031 --> 02:12:21.999
We do this, I call the shots.

02:12:22.001 --> 02:12:23.703
My crew, my job, not yours.

02:12:24.703 --> 02:12:26.502
Got it?

02:12:26.504 --> 02:12:28.540
- Completely understand.
- That's the way it has to be.

02:12:29.842 --> 02:12:31.174
That's it.

02:12:31.176 --> 02:12:32.776
It's my baby.

02:12:32.778 --> 02:12:34.012
That's what I've got.

02:12:35.681 --> 02:12:37.514
How did you get
a hold of all this stuff?

02:12:37.516 --> 02:12:39.883
You got this all at that bar?

02:12:39.885 --> 02:12:41.387
Collected it over time.

02:12:43.855 --> 02:12:44.890
Wow.

02:12:54.799 --> 02:12:55.901
Job for Superman.

02:13:09.248 --> 02:13:11.348
Cheers.

02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:13.550
Thank you. I love when
you call me Princess.

02:13:14.887 --> 02:13:16.255
You work across the street?

02:13:16.922 --> 02:13:17.924
Yeah.

02:13:18.589 --> 02:13:20.223
Diamond exchange?

02:13:20.225 --> 02:13:21.227
That's right.

02:13:25.064 --> 02:13:26.332
Beer's on me.
