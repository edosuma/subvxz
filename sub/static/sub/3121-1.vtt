WEBVTT

00:08.750 --> 00:10.458
To be a champion,

00:10.625 --> 00:12.916
you cannot allow any kind of...

00:13.084 --> 00:16.499
outside, negative force
to come in and affect you.

00:17.875 --> 00:20.333
Being involved with a girl
before a contest

00:20.500 --> 00:22.416
can have a negative on my mind

00:22.584 --> 00:24.416
and destroy my workouts.

00:24.750 --> 00:28.791
So I have to cut my emotions off
and be kind of cold

00:29.167 --> 00:30.999
before a competition.

00:32.459 --> 00:35.124
It's what I do
with the rest of the things.

00:35.667 --> 00:37.749
Someone steals my car?
I don't care.

00:37.917 --> 00:39.833
I can't be bothered with that.

00:40.625 --> 00:42.874
My secretary calls the insurer

00:43.042 --> 00:44.833
and I'd laugh about it.

00:45.792 --> 00:47.124
I've trained myself

00:47.750 --> 00:50.416
to be cold,
to keep these things out of mind.

00:50.584 --> 00:53.833
There was in a way... a sad story...

00:54.000 --> 00:57.041
When my father died,
my mother called me.

00:57.209 --> 00:59.291
This was 2 months before a contest.

00:59.625 --> 01:02.208
She said come home for the funeral.

01:02.625 --> 01:06.208
I said: No, it's too late.
Nothing to be done.

01:06.375 --> 01:07.666
Sorry, I can't come.

01:08.500 --> 01:10.291
I didn't explain why.

01:10.459 --> 01:12.583
I found other excuses.

01:12.875 --> 01:16.083
How do you tell a mother
whose husband died

01:16.584 --> 01:18.833
about your...

01:19.584 --> 01:20.416
trip.

01:30.959 --> 01:31.958
Morel!

01:32.792 --> 01:34.249
We know you're there!

01:34.584 --> 01:36.583
I didn't come here for nothing!

01:37.625 --> 01:39.874
Open the door, fucking faggot!

01:43.167 --> 01:44.999
Don't make me go haywire!

01:46.125 --> 01:47.083
I'm coming!

01:47.292 --> 01:48.416
Listen up.

01:48.584 --> 01:51.833
Either you open and we talk
or I bust it down.

01:54.375 --> 01:55.083
Who is it?

01:55.250 --> 01:57.041
Grandma!
I came for a blowjob!

01:59.167 --> 02:00.083
Luigi?

02:00.709 --> 02:02.916
You didn't say you were coming.

02:03.209 --> 02:04.999
Wait, I'll get dressed.

02:05.167 --> 02:07.041
I didn't come for your butt.

02:12.875 --> 02:14.374
Putting on a prom dress?

02:14.625 --> 02:15.541
Just a sec!

02:18.292 --> 02:19.583
Bust it open.

02:27.459 --> 02:28.666
Where's my pal?

02:28.959 --> 02:30.458
Where's my cutie-pie?

02:31.542 --> 02:33.124
Kid! Where are you going?

02:33.709 --> 02:35.749
And with my dough?
Get him.

02:37.459 --> 02:38.624
Don't bother.

02:40.375 --> 02:42.374
Why even run? We'll find you.

02:42.542 --> 02:43.874
Shithead!

02:46.750 --> 02:47.458
Where is he?

02:47.625 --> 02:49.708
That way! Run!

02:50.000 --> 02:50.999
Faster!

02:52.459 --> 02:53.624
Fat pig can't run.

03:14.250 --> 03:15.416
What's going on?

03:15.584 --> 03:16.666
Just a minute.

03:16.834 --> 03:19.166
It's not a hotel.
Pay or leave!

03:26.459 --> 03:27.499
What the hell?

03:28.834 --> 03:30.458
Are you crazy?

03:30.625 --> 03:32.208
How do I get out now?

03:32.375 --> 03:34.916
This way. Plenty of room.
Take that.

03:35.084 --> 03:37.583
- Why trash the place?
- He deserves it!

03:37.875 --> 03:39.833
What do you want from my son?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.916
Quiet, bitch.
Get a flea-bath.

03:42.084 --> 03:43.833
- The nerve of you!
- Shut up!

03:44.000 --> 03:45.833
Tell your son we'll find him.

03:58.625 --> 04:00.166
I went where you said.

04:00.542 --> 04:01.874
He disappeared.

04:03.542 --> 04:04.541
I'm coming.

04:42.667 --> 04:44.041
Don't want a beer?

04:54.042 --> 04:54.916
Coming.

04:55.167 --> 04:56.791
- Mom...
- Is he here?

04:58.042 --> 05:00.666
What shit did you mix us up in now?

05:01.292 --> 05:03.333
- Stop!
- You drive me crazy!

05:03.584 --> 05:04.666
What is it?

05:04.834 --> 05:06.624
Some guys trashed his place.

05:06.792 --> 05:08.458
They want to waste him!

05:08.625 --> 05:10.166
You woke up the kid.

05:10.417 --> 05:11.666
Keep it down.

05:11.875 --> 05:14.083
What the fuck did you do now?

05:19.792 --> 05:22.124
Haven't you put me through enough?

05:22.334 --> 05:24.249
I just finished paying it off.

05:24.417 --> 05:27.624
For 2 years I slave away
paying off your crap.

05:28.042 --> 05:30.208
That has nothing to do with tonight.

05:31.334 --> 05:32.458
Who were they?

05:32.834 --> 05:35.291
Losers I've owed money to
for a while.

05:35.792 --> 05:38.541
They sold me a computer.
Mine was stolen.

05:38.792 --> 05:41.749
They came too early.
I said end of the month.

05:41.917 --> 05:43.416
It's no big deal.

05:43.584 --> 05:44.916
No big deal...

05:45.917 --> 05:46.916
Is she asleep?

05:47.209 --> 05:49.041
She's telling her a story.

05:50.084 --> 05:51.999
9 months probation, Antoine.

05:52.250 --> 05:55.124
Screw up and you do time.
First him, now you.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.958
Me? That stuff was 10 years ago.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.374
This has nothing to do with before.

06:00.709 --> 06:01.958
It's not my fault.

06:02.125 --> 06:03.541
- Listen...
- You listen.

06:03.709 --> 06:05.083
I'm fed up with this.

06:05.542 --> 06:07.624
- No more apartment.
- Not that.

06:07.792 --> 06:09.874
I'll fix it up and you disappear.

06:10.042 --> 06:11.999
Leave the area. Find a job.

06:13.542 --> 06:14.916
Where do I go?

06:17.500 --> 06:18.833
- Sleeping?
- Yeah.

06:20.375 --> 06:22.708
Not here,
not with a baby on the way.

06:23.292 --> 06:25.541
How can I get by
if I'm homeless?

06:27.625 --> 06:29.374
There's always the old man.

06:29.834 --> 06:30.916
This is serious.

06:31.084 --> 06:33.124
I'm serious too. He's changed.

06:33.459 --> 06:35.458
- You saw him?
- I still do.

06:35.667 --> 06:38.624
- You never said so.
- I meant to. Just busy.

06:39.375 --> 06:41.916
He never helped
when you were kids.

06:42.084 --> 06:44.208
Now that you're grown up,
he helps?

06:45.042 --> 06:47.374
I haven't seen him in 5 years.

06:48.167 --> 06:50.124
I can't stay in St. Etienne.

06:50.375 --> 06:52.666
I have no contacts there for work.

06:52.834 --> 06:55.416
You've never kept a job here either.

06:55.709 --> 06:57.333
It's the only solution.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.749
We'll go tomorrow.

06:59.917 --> 07:01.749
You'll sleep here tonight.

07:02.250 --> 07:03.666
Don't make that face.

07:03.834 --> 07:05.416
Take responsibility.

07:05.750 --> 07:06.583
Mom...

07:06.750 --> 07:07.624
The cigarette.

07:08.709 --> 07:09.833
Sorry.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.624
Can I stay the night?

07:56.625 --> 07:58.791
I wake up early. I'd rather not.

08:04.459 --> 08:05.333
Great.

09:33.750 --> 09:35.208
You look like shit.

09:35.375 --> 09:36.333
I didn't eat.

09:39.209 --> 09:40.708
Doing drugs?

09:41.042 --> 09:42.958
I just took a pill to sleep.

09:45.750 --> 09:48.208
What happened?
Spare me that computer crap.

09:48.375 --> 09:50.458
I made that up
to calm Mom down.

09:53.167 --> 09:54.791
Do I know the guys?

09:55.292 --> 09:56.249
A little.

09:56.875 --> 09:58.166
Not Luigi, I hope.

09:59.959 --> 10:02.416
It is?
Fuck, you're in deep shit.

10:02.667 --> 10:06.083
You're a pain. I said to avoid him.
He won't give up.

10:06.250 --> 10:09.041
I can make him money.
He's too impatient.

10:09.250 --> 10:10.374
What do you owe?

10:11.209 --> 10:13.874
I'm onto something big, I swear.

10:14.042 --> 10:15.583
Two weeks and no problem.

10:15.792 --> 10:18.249
No problem... something big...

10:19.209 --> 10:20.624
Fucking clown.

10:20.792 --> 10:23.333
Nothing illegal.
Just wait two weeks.

10:23.500 --> 10:26.749
Return on investment
and I'll be far away.

10:27.834 --> 10:29.499
- Post card for you.
- Sure.

10:29.709 --> 10:31.958
Get your act together
at the old man's.

10:32.542 --> 10:33.958
Why keep him a secret?

10:34.792 --> 10:36.416
So the kids have a grandpa.

10:36.584 --> 10:39.416
We never knew him.
My wife never knew her mom.

10:40.375 --> 10:41.583
Important, isn't it?

10:44.709 --> 10:45.874
This is it?

10:46.375 --> 10:47.874
You said St. Etienne.

10:48.042 --> 10:49.958
Relax, it's 5 minutes away.

10:56.959 --> 10:58.333
Where is he?

11:03.042 --> 11:04.458
Fuck, no network.

11:06.250 --> 11:07.583
It sucks here.

11:46.334 --> 11:47.208
Dad?

11:48.417 --> 11:49.249
How are you?

11:51.917 --> 11:53.124
Why are you here?

11:56.209 --> 11:57.333
Antoine?

11:58.292 --> 12:00.249
I didn't recognize you
in the hat.

12:00.417 --> 12:01.374
Yeah, I saw.

12:18.625 --> 12:20.291
- How long?
- Two weeks.

12:23.167 --> 12:25.124
You don't have to.
Not my idea.

12:25.292 --> 12:27.249
He needs to stay out of Lyon.

12:27.417 --> 12:29.124
- Why?
- He owes a guy money.

12:29.292 --> 12:31.749
I borrow to invest: big difference.

12:32.500 --> 12:33.999
What kind of investment?

12:34.875 --> 12:37.374
Import-export. Nothing illegal.

12:38.834 --> 12:39.541
Can he stay?

12:42.292 --> 12:44.458
I won't lie.
It's not the best time.

12:44.750 --> 12:47.749
I'm training. I'm not easy.
It's small here.

12:48.042 --> 12:49.333
See? Told you so.

12:53.792 --> 12:55.958
He can sleep on the couch.

12:57.625 --> 13:01.333
With 3 weeks till Championships,
I want no trouble.

13:03.584 --> 13:05.083
You got even bigger.

13:05.250 --> 13:07.583
A bit.
And his Post Office job?

13:07.792 --> 13:10.083
He got fired.
Stealing checkbooks.

13:10.250 --> 13:13.083
Damn, always the same.
No second chances.

13:15.125 --> 13:16.624
No railroad jobs?

13:16.792 --> 13:19.666
I left 6 years ago.
No more contacts.

13:19.834 --> 13:21.749
Does he have a police record?

13:22.209 --> 13:23.833
Like with you, I can't help.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.166
Don't let him vegetate.

13:26.334 --> 13:28.583
- I'm not a babysitter.
- I know.

13:28.959 --> 13:30.083
Does he do drugs?

13:30.250 --> 13:32.041
No, nothing serious.

13:32.334 --> 13:34.041
And his import-export stuff?

13:34.209 --> 13:35.291
What do you think?

13:47.250 --> 13:48.499
No smoking inside.

13:49.000 --> 13:49.916
Okay, Vincent.

13:59.500 --> 14:00.624
Are you sick?

14:02.750 --> 14:04.583
Amino acids to burn faster.

14:05.584 --> 14:07.541
- Burn?
- Body fat.

14:08.084 --> 14:09.999
They're 100% natural.

14:11.250 --> 14:11.999
Look.

14:12.709 --> 14:13.874
I believe you.

14:23.167 --> 14:25.291
When did we see each other last?

14:27.209 --> 14:28.333
Grandma's funeral.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.333
I'll be down in a minute.

14:39.250 --> 14:40.374
Got your keys?

14:40.917 --> 14:42.208
So why call?

14:43.792 --> 14:45.458
Yeah, I'm coming down.

14:46.500 --> 14:48.041
I'm training then I work.

14:48.209 --> 14:49.958
I won't stay here long.

14:51.167 --> 14:52.624
You staying or coming?

14:52.875 --> 14:54.541
I'd like to shower.

14:55.042 --> 14:56.666
Towels in the bathroom.

14:56.875 --> 14:59.416
If you're hungry,
there's all you need.

15:05.209 --> 15:06.249
Hey, Vincent.

15:06.584 --> 15:08.874
Sorry,
you seemed to be running late.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.499
Well, I'm here now.

15:19.417 --> 15:20.624
Sleep well?

15:24.792 --> 15:26.499
Did you run this morning?

15:29.042 --> 15:30.249
Pick the music?

15:30.792 --> 15:31.583
Not yet.

15:32.334 --> 15:34.916
We should rehearse the routine
to music now.

15:35.625 --> 15:36.791
Give me 2 days.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.374
Shoulders and triceps now.

15:44.959 --> 15:46.124
Fine with me.

16:33.959 --> 16:35.208
What a psycho!

17:53.209 --> 17:55.708
We'll find you, motherfucker

18:23.292 --> 18:25.541
I haven't worked out in a while.

18:25.709 --> 18:27.458
It's like riding a bike.

18:43.125 --> 18:45.333
1 st is hot, 2nd is not

18:58.959 --> 19:01.958
Every achievement
begins with the decision to try

19:08.959 --> 19:11.791
You don't give a thing
till you give it all

19:35.125 --> 19:37.333
What is it?
You don't find that rude?

19:37.500 --> 19:40.166
I'm sorry.
I've never seen that.

19:40.334 --> 19:41.541
Seen what?

19:41.709 --> 19:43.458
- A woman...
- With muscles?

19:43.875 --> 19:45.583
- Yeah.
- You haven't seen much.

19:46.125 --> 19:48.624
Yeah but... can I touch?

19:49.084 --> 19:51.374
Want to touch? Touch, go on.

19:54.375 --> 19:56.208
Happy now?
It's hard, right?

19:57.042 --> 19:57.791
See now?

19:57.959 --> 19:59.166
Here to sign up?

19:59.459 --> 20:01.208
Looking for my dad, Vincent.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.541
You're Vincent's son...

20:05.584 --> 20:06.708
Richard!

20:06.959 --> 20:08.166
Look, Vincent's son.

20:08.334 --> 20:09.166
Really?

20:09.417 --> 20:11.666
- Antoine.
- Caroline. Pleasure.

20:11.834 --> 20:13.499
He's there with Vadim.

20:13.667 --> 20:15.541
Work out. You're soft.

20:16.292 --> 20:17.541
It's all in here.

20:18.084 --> 20:20.083
Say the word
and we'll work out.

20:20.417 --> 20:21.166
Cool.

20:21.417 --> 20:22.541
7, that's good.

20:22.709 --> 20:23.999
Let's go to 12.

20:25.542 --> 20:26.333
Push!

20:28.959 --> 20:29.916
Two more.

20:30.084 --> 20:31.041
Don't touch me.

20:32.375 --> 20:33.458
Last one.

20:36.584 --> 20:38.208
12, great. Put it down.

20:38.875 --> 20:39.541
Drink.

20:45.917 --> 20:48.124
- Can I help you?
- It's my son.

20:49.375 --> 20:50.624
Oh, okay.

20:50.875 --> 20:51.833
Satisfied?

20:53.625 --> 20:55.041
Food-wise.

20:55.584 --> 20:56.624
Not really.

20:56.875 --> 20:59.499
- What next?
- We move onto triceps.

20:59.667 --> 21:01.124
Another series of 12.

21:01.292 --> 21:02.041
You did a lot.

21:02.625 --> 21:04.624
A lot isn't enough to win.

21:04.792 --> 21:07.791
On 20. I like your drive,
when you want more.

21:13.500 --> 21:14.249
Breathe.

21:14.875 --> 21:16.041
Four... Higher.

21:16.750 --> 21:18.083
Come down gently.

21:19.084 --> 21:20.291
Six...

21:22.834 --> 21:23.708
Push!

21:24.709 --> 21:25.749
Breathe.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.124
Last one.

21:28.500 --> 21:29.999
Put them down. Great!

21:31.292 --> 21:32.791
Time for dips.

21:33.625 --> 21:34.666
Good job.

21:35.584 --> 21:36.708
And your shoulder?

21:36.875 --> 21:38.083
It's holding up.

21:49.625 --> 21:52.124
- What can he win?
- French Championship.

21:52.875 --> 21:53.874
He's not too old?

21:54.375 --> 21:56.083
Not for the Masters.

21:56.292 --> 21:57.541
What's Masters?

21:57.709 --> 22:00.624
Veterans.
Between 50 and 60 years old.

22:00.917 --> 22:01.708
Any chance?

22:01.959 --> 22:05.874
Sure, unless we get screwed into 2nd
like last year.

22:06.209 --> 22:07.624
He's better than most.

22:08.000 --> 22:08.874
I'm not worried.

22:09.459 --> 22:10.874
You saw his lines.

22:11.042 --> 22:12.416
Yeah I saw, but...

22:12.584 --> 22:14.458
His definition is amazing.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.916
We're doing great. I'm really happy.

22:18.084 --> 22:20.166
It's first place or nothing.

22:28.417 --> 22:29.541
Excuse me.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.999
That soy milk tastes like cardboard.

22:34.167 --> 22:37.124
I asked everywhere.
Only brand they carry.

22:38.167 --> 22:40.041
Put it back. I don't want it.

22:40.250 --> 22:41.291
The baby food?

22:41.459 --> 22:44.124
Took it all.
They rarely have sweet potato.

22:53.459 --> 22:54.624
You know this?

22:54.959 --> 22:57.249
- Linseeds.
- Ever seen them?

22:58.584 --> 23:00.874
Yeah, but not in that package.

23:01.250 --> 23:02.624
I never have.

23:04.750 --> 23:05.374
I took this.

23:08.459 --> 23:10.249
If you knew the crap in it.

23:10.417 --> 23:12.333
Let him take what he wants.

23:12.500 --> 23:13.874
It's for his own good.

23:15.084 --> 23:16.541
Do we have everything?

23:16.709 --> 23:18.874
We need broccoli, chicken...

23:21.250 --> 23:22.916
I'm working on it. Relax.

23:23.084 --> 23:25.291
You'll have it in 10 days.
Okay?

23:26.625 --> 23:28.291
- Is this any good?
- Fair.

23:28.459 --> 23:31.541
254,68 euros.
Superman comes at a cost!

23:32.334 --> 23:33.874
Everything does.

23:34.375 --> 23:37.458
You have to hide
that junk food you bought.

23:37.834 --> 23:40.708
I don't want to see it.
It makes me tense.

23:40.875 --> 23:42.083
Okay, Vincent.

23:42.250 --> 23:43.958
Can you drive, please?

23:47.500 --> 23:49.333
Mind if she stays for dinner?

23:49.625 --> 23:51.124
I can leave you alone.

23:51.292 --> 23:54.999
I didn't mean that.
She's sort of a high-school teacher.

23:55.417 --> 23:57.041
Works with young people.

23:57.792 --> 23:59.291
If ever you want to talk.

23:59.459 --> 24:01.624
I got nothing to say
to a teacher.

24:15.709 --> 24:16.666
Dinner.

24:23.084 --> 24:24.166
He's not coming?

24:24.334 --> 24:26.749
He can't see us eat
when he's shredding.

24:26.917 --> 24:28.458
It's the smell too.

24:29.250 --> 24:32.666
So I try to eat cold stuff.
Salads, carpaccio.

24:32.834 --> 24:34.958
When he agrees to eat with me.

24:35.667 --> 24:36.958
Not always easy.

24:37.125 --> 24:39.499
Why complain?
It's only 2 months a year.

24:40.084 --> 24:41.416
It's more like 6.

24:41.667 --> 24:43.333
You're free to see friends.

24:48.167 --> 24:49.749
I saw your tattoo.

24:51.375 --> 24:52.666
Life goes on.

24:52.834 --> 24:54.291
I did it in 2000.

24:54.875 --> 24:56.666
Happiness is a choice.

24:56.917 --> 24:58.458
A sentence I like.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.291
I have another on my leg.

25:04.209 --> 25:05.416
Got any?

25:06.292 --> 25:07.374
Don't like them?

25:08.417 --> 25:09.583
Why not?

25:09.750 --> 25:11.749
I don't want any traces.

25:12.792 --> 25:14.041
They can be nice.

25:14.875 --> 25:16.291
Like jewelry.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.541
I'll go have a cigarette.

25:48.084 --> 25:50.249
- He didn't eat?
- He wasn't hungry.

25:50.417 --> 25:52.124
See how skinny he is?

25:52.334 --> 25:53.874
How old is he?

25:54.084 --> 25:56.666
I don't know... 23, 25...

25:56.834 --> 25:58.208
I can't remember.

25:58.625 --> 26:01.458
Have a cigarette with him.
I'll clean up.

26:11.417 --> 26:13.083
So you're a teacher?

26:13.834 --> 26:15.124
Did he say that?

26:15.917 --> 26:17.083
Not at all.

26:17.709 --> 26:20.333
Secretary in the high school
I went to.

26:20.750 --> 26:23.249
It's like I've been there 100 years.

26:26.417 --> 26:28.333
You've got some nerve.

26:28.500 --> 26:30.083
It's a digest-spliff.

26:30.417 --> 26:32.124
You smoke a lot?

26:32.417 --> 26:35.874
I'm not addicted.
I can stop whenever I want.

26:36.542 --> 26:38.958
You know all addicts say that.

26:40.875 --> 26:43.999
There's a psychologist
at the school where I work.

26:44.209 --> 26:46.624
If ever you want to meet her...

26:48.000 --> 26:48.624
Sure.

26:49.667 --> 26:50.791
Why not?

26:51.125 --> 26:54.291
I'll say that as a kid,
my dad was absent.

26:54.459 --> 26:57.749
Without a role-model,
my ego never developed.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.083
It's why I smoke.

26:59.250 --> 27:02.083
I'm unhappy with myself,
depressed even.

27:02.250 --> 27:04.791
And emotionally,
a fucking black hole.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.666
I'm doing my cardio workout.

27:10.459 --> 27:12.374
And I need to see a shrink?

27:13.417 --> 27:14.624
I can't stay.

27:14.792 --> 27:17.499
Pay back those guys and we'll see.

27:17.834 --> 27:21.249
You can't imagine.
It's another world. Not normal.

27:21.417 --> 27:22.416
Goodnight.

27:22.584 --> 27:23.791
Mom!

28:03.250 --> 28:04.458
Good morning.

28:16.500 --> 28:18.041
Strike tomorrow at school.

28:18.209 --> 28:21.166
Can you take off,
spend the day with me?

28:27.250 --> 28:30.666
I'm talking.
Why don't you answer?

28:33.834 --> 28:35.166
I'm talking to you.

28:35.334 --> 28:36.624
What's the problem?

28:37.542 --> 28:39.249
Fuck, it's starting again.

28:39.417 --> 28:40.458
Asshole!

28:49.417 --> 28:50.874
Can you lend me 500?

28:51.334 --> 28:54.208
Did you all decide
to piss me off today?

28:55.459 --> 28:57.916
500 euros.
You're out of your mind.

28:58.334 --> 29:00.416
I can work reception
in exchange.

29:00.584 --> 29:02.458
Helping out customers.

29:02.625 --> 29:04.374
I'm not an employment agency.

29:08.459 --> 29:09.958
Hold it, hold it.

29:10.584 --> 29:11.333
Three.

29:12.125 --> 29:13.791
Four... good job.

29:15.750 --> 29:16.958
Concentrate.

29:21.709 --> 29:23.624
Hold it, hold it...

29:25.834 --> 29:27.208
What are you working?

29:27.375 --> 29:28.541
My back.

29:29.792 --> 29:31.624
Antoine, give me a hand.

29:35.792 --> 29:36.916
Take the wheelchair.

29:39.917 --> 29:43.124
If I get too bulky,
it'll be hard to pull myself up.

29:43.292 --> 29:45.666
Relax, you still have some leeway.

29:45.834 --> 29:47.916
Next year I'll put in a ramp.

29:48.084 --> 29:49.749
That would help a lot.

29:52.750 --> 29:54.749
What happened? An accident?

29:54.917 --> 29:58.791
No, a neuromuscular disease.
But he has tough mindset.

29:59.625 --> 30:00.291
Come here.

30:02.584 --> 30:04.999
I've had these flyers for a while.

30:05.750 --> 30:08.791
Cover the neighborhood.
Every windshield.

30:09.209 --> 30:11.374
Mailboxes serve no purpose.

30:11.792 --> 30:15.291
To the left,
there's a supermarket parking lot.

30:15.459 --> 30:19.333
- The supermarket...
- Just down the street.

30:19.542 --> 30:20.666
Get going.

30:21.792 --> 30:22.958
I'm off.

30:28.625 --> 30:29.624
I'll grab lunch.

30:29.792 --> 30:31.374
See you shortly.

30:40.625 --> 30:43.083
It's for a jacket
but I lost the receipt.

30:43.250 --> 30:45.583
- When did you drop it off?
- I forget.

30:45.750 --> 30:48.249
- What did it look like?
- No idea.

30:49.375 --> 30:52.374
If you can't remember when
or what it looks like...

30:52.584 --> 30:53.833
That one there.

30:54.709 --> 30:55.708
This one?

30:57.834 --> 30:58.541
Not this!

31:01.625 --> 31:03.124
What are you doing?

31:04.667 --> 31:07.416
Stop right now
or I'll call the police!

31:07.584 --> 31:08.916
So call the cops!

31:10.417 --> 31:12.041
Tell them
what your son did!

31:12.334 --> 31:13.999
Either he pays me back

31:14.334 --> 31:16.291
or I burn this place,
and you too!

31:16.459 --> 31:18.208
We want our money back!

31:18.625 --> 31:20.291
Fucking bitch!

31:45.459 --> 31:47.083
Goddammit!

31:53.542 --> 31:56.374
Stretch it out...
and bring it in,

31:56.709 --> 31:58.416
nice and slow.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.333
Feel it in your buttocks.

32:05.875 --> 32:07.916
You okay? Did it go well?

32:08.542 --> 32:09.624
Perfect.

32:10.167 --> 32:12.541
But you didn't give me enough.

32:12.709 --> 32:15.666
I could have done
2 or 3 more blocks.

32:17.167 --> 32:18.791
Don't play with me.

32:20.167 --> 32:21.124
You want work?

32:28.792 --> 32:32.374
First the toilets,
then the shower and locker room.

33:16.709 --> 33:18.583
- Wait here.
- Where are you going?

33:18.750 --> 33:21.791
I'm running an errand
at the Laundromat.

34:16.042 --> 34:18.458
Why did he hit you?

34:21.458 --> 34:23.458
We were just playing a game.

34:23.625 --> 34:25.041
Buckle up.

34:26.625 --> 34:28.666
Next series. Use your abs.

34:28.833 --> 34:30.541
Keep your back still.

34:39.667 --> 34:40.623
Vadim.

34:42.292 --> 34:43.333
11... Yeah?

34:44.667 --> 34:45.666
12 and stop.

34:45.833 --> 34:46.708
Is that you?

34:46.875 --> 34:49.791
In Milan, 5 years ago.
Just before my accident.

34:49.958 --> 34:50.623
Accident?

34:50.875 --> 34:52.458
I'd just gone pro.

34:53.083 --> 34:55.916
More training sessions,
heavier loads.

34:57.375 --> 34:59.208
My aorta just gave in.

34:59.459 --> 35:00.249
The aorta...

35:00.417 --> 35:03.833
The artery that pumps blood
from the heart.

35:05.084 --> 35:07.999
I was lifting heavy,
especially squats. Over 300.

35:08.459 --> 35:09.499
Like this?

35:09.667 --> 35:11.916
No breathing
for increased pressure.

35:12.084 --> 35:14.333
I lost 40 kilos at the hospital...

35:14.500 --> 35:16.041
Same old broken record.

35:16.500 --> 35:19.624
- He asked.
- Damned bore.

35:20.042 --> 35:22.208
But he's the one who asked!

35:23.834 --> 35:24.458
Finished?

35:25.000 --> 35:26.249
Who's Richard?

35:26.417 --> 35:28.458
Him. With the red bandana.

35:28.625 --> 35:30.916
Is he stronger than my father?

35:31.625 --> 35:32.833
One more series.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.041
Richard, stronger?

35:36.250 --> 35:39.541
Your son asked who's stronger,
Richard or you.

35:39.709 --> 35:40.708
Richard!

35:41.959 --> 35:44.416
Who beat you last year in Colmar?

35:44.584 --> 35:45.208
You did.

35:45.417 --> 35:47.333
- How many times in all?
- 3.

35:47.667 --> 35:48.791
I didn't hear.

35:49.125 --> 35:51.624
You beat me 3 times.
But it won't be 4.

35:52.209 --> 35:53.749
The future will tell.

35:53.917 --> 35:55.999
We'll see. Get ready.
I'm coming.

35:56.167 --> 35:57.458
Got the answer now?

36:10.542 --> 36:11.666
Hey, bro!

36:11.834 --> 36:13.083
Don't answer anymore?

36:13.625 --> 36:14.833
What's going on?

36:15.000 --> 36:15.833
Fucking prick!

36:16.625 --> 36:17.833
What did I do?

36:18.000 --> 36:20.291
What did you do?
You're kidding me!

36:20.459 --> 36:23.833
Two girls threatened Mom
and Luigi attacked me!

36:24.292 --> 36:27.124
Cut the crap.
Why do you owe everyone money?

36:27.750 --> 36:29.083
I invest for them...

36:29.250 --> 36:30.749
Cut the fucking crap!

36:30.917 --> 36:33.333
Luigi says you owe him 3,000 euros!

36:33.500 --> 36:36.791
I'll explain.
Let go and I'll explain!

36:38.375 --> 36:39.458
Fuck this.

36:39.750 --> 36:41.666
At first it was small amounts.

36:41.834 --> 36:44.833
Guys I know would give me
30 or 50 euros.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.791
Then I met other guys.

36:46.959 --> 36:50.041
Their money reimbursed
the first ones with interest,

36:50.209 --> 36:52.833
25% for them, 25% for me.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.249
It worked well.
Word got around.

36:55.417 --> 36:57.416
People put in
more and more money.

36:57.584 --> 37:01.291
And I quickly found
new investors, like Luigi.

37:01.459 --> 37:03.749
Except he played big from the start.

37:03.917 --> 37:06.458
That's how I fucked up.
I didn't refuse.

37:06.625 --> 37:09.583
So I couldn't pay back
the others either.

37:10.750 --> 37:12.541
You owe how much to who?

37:26.417 --> 37:28.833
You are seriously fucked up.

37:29.334 --> 37:30.583
Think you're Madoff?

37:34.875 --> 37:35.749
So selfish.

37:36.500 --> 37:38.166
Did you think of Mom?

37:39.250 --> 37:42.749
You mix her up in this.
She was crying all day yesterday.

37:44.417 --> 37:45.458
What do you say?

37:46.042 --> 37:47.583
I swear I was quitting.

37:52.167 --> 37:55.583
What will you do?
Ask the old man for help?

37:55.875 --> 37:57.916
- I'm working.
- Not enough.

38:01.417 --> 38:04.291
Give me a week.
I swear I'll figure it out.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.249
You really got shit for brains.

38:10.542 --> 38:11.333
Come inside.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.333
I've wasted enough time.

38:14.375 --> 38:15.374
Apologize to Mom.

38:16.292 --> 38:17.833
Apologize yourself.

39:12.709 --> 39:14.708
It's hard to say because...

39:14.875 --> 39:18.499
I like them both
but people know Rocky 3 more.

39:18.792 --> 39:20.916
Eye of the Tiger is so you.

39:21.084 --> 39:22.458
I don't think so.

39:22.625 --> 39:25.541
Richard will use it
just to piss me off.

39:25.709 --> 39:27.166
Well, in that case...

39:27.875 --> 39:30.833
As long as you don't do
last year's robot.

39:31.334 --> 39:34.041
That was one of Vadim's dumb ideas.

39:35.709 --> 39:38.499
Born in the USA. It suits me more.

39:39.875 --> 39:43.374
The United States means power.
Superpower.

39:44.125 --> 39:45.583
It's up to you.

39:51.542 --> 39:52.291
You choose.

39:52.875 --> 39:54.874
Eye of the Tiger
or Born in the USA?

39:55.459 --> 39:58.916
Eye of the Tiger is tacky.
Old-fashioned.

39:59.417 --> 40:02.041
Born in the USA is good.
Depends what for.

40:02.834 --> 40:04.249
Springsteen's better.

40:04.417 --> 40:07.583
El Dorado... the American Dream.
That's me.

40:07.917 --> 40:10.208
You got it wrong.
That's not it.

40:10.375 --> 40:13.291
It's about Vietnam vets.
Against the war.

40:13.584 --> 40:15.291
- Sure?
- Everyone knows.

40:16.875 --> 40:18.249
You didn't know that?

40:33.917 --> 40:34.666
I fucked up?

40:35.084 --> 40:37.666
No, anyway
I prefer Eye of the Tiger.

40:37.834 --> 40:39.291
- What's it for?
- Posing.

40:39.959 --> 40:41.749
The music counts a lot.

40:41.917 --> 40:43.666
Vietnam doesn't work.

40:43.834 --> 40:47.083
Good thing you told him.
Maybe he'll change it.

40:47.584 --> 40:49.791
He doesn't like it
when I'm right.

41:08.084 --> 41:09.499
Instead of the camera?

41:09.667 --> 41:10.666
No, with it.

41:16.084 --> 41:17.333
You got ID?

42:31.500 --> 42:32.999
This is junk.

42:33.417 --> 42:35.791
It comes to 950 euros.

42:36.084 --> 42:38.749
950?
The guitar's worth 1,000.

42:38.917 --> 42:40.499
That's our offer.

42:40.667 --> 42:43.708
We pay by check.
Or cash, but we take 10%.

42:44.042 --> 42:45.583
I want cash.

42:46.792 --> 42:50.708
Start hunched up.
When the music starts, open up...

42:52.250 --> 42:53.999
On the first "Tah" look up.

42:54.167 --> 42:55.999
Then raise your arms

42:57.417 --> 42:59.124
Front double biceps.

42:59.417 --> 43:02.499
Stand up, roll the arms
and lay it on them.

43:04.250 --> 43:05.333
What a ballerina!

43:05.584 --> 43:08.166
Hands on your hips.
Upper back.

43:08.334 --> 43:10.416
And hold it. Judges need time.

43:10.917 --> 43:12.124
I know.

43:12.292 --> 43:15.291
Then show your best profile.
Biceps, chest.

43:15.459 --> 43:16.958
Head high. Proud.

43:18.042 --> 43:19.874
I know it better than you.

43:20.334 --> 43:21.291
And press down.

43:21.917 --> 43:23.958
Then do most muscular.

43:24.584 --> 43:26.041
One, two...

43:26.209 --> 43:28.583
Smile at the public and the jury.

43:28.750 --> 43:29.874
You can stay.

43:30.334 --> 43:31.499
I'm all done.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.833
From the beginning with music?

43:36.292 --> 43:37.541
I'll never remember.

43:37.709 --> 43:40.291
I said to pick the song.
We're behind.

43:55.500 --> 43:57.166
- Hi, Richard.
- How are you?

43:57.792 --> 43:58.999
I'm okay.

43:59.834 --> 44:01.374
- Like it here?
- Yeah...

44:01.542 --> 44:02.416
Why not try?

44:03.000 --> 44:04.999
- Try what?
- Lifting weights.

44:05.417 --> 44:06.916
- I have no time.
- How so?

44:07.209 --> 44:09.541
With all the cleaning up...

44:09.709 --> 44:11.416
Nice sport, you know.

44:12.542 --> 44:14.166
You want the same brand?

44:19.584 --> 44:20.874
Good business.

44:21.042 --> 44:24.208
She's doing great.
Opening another one next month.

44:24.417 --> 44:26.916
- Caroline, where's the BCAA?
- Behind you.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.916
I spoke to Richard.

44:31.084 --> 44:32.666
What did he tell you?

44:33.042 --> 44:36.458
Your legs are your weak point.
Since your accident.

44:38.625 --> 44:41.833
And that your back's a problem.
Not big enough.

44:42.667 --> 44:45.833
Back size isn't what counts.
It's the girth.

44:48.584 --> 44:50.208
You get a kick out of it.

44:51.542 --> 44:53.083
You find it funny.

44:53.250 --> 44:54.583
I didn't say a word.

44:55.625 --> 44:57.583
What are his weak points?

44:58.167 --> 44:59.374
He didn't say.

44:59.542 --> 45:01.583
Because he has none?

45:02.000 --> 45:04.333
So why does he always lose to me?

45:06.792 --> 45:07.999
Where are you?

45:09.709 --> 45:11.916
I'll meet you at the station.

45:12.959 --> 45:14.583
In St. Etienne.

45:15.875 --> 45:17.624
Look for a sign. It'll say.

45:18.792 --> 45:19.999
10-15 minutes.

45:21.750 --> 45:22.708
See you.

45:22.875 --> 45:24.041
About Richard.

45:24.834 --> 45:28.791
The underwear we pose in
gets covered in sweat and pro-Tan.

45:28.959 --> 45:31.791
He saves his, unwashed.
Like hunting trophies.

45:32.500 --> 45:34.708
Disgusting...
How do you know?

45:35.167 --> 45:35.874
I just do.

45:36.084 --> 45:37.708
You're just upset.

45:37.875 --> 45:40.749
Not at all. I like Richard.
We're friends.

45:43.792 --> 45:45.458
I'll pay. Let's go.

45:55.792 --> 45:57.249
What a dick.

46:01.709 --> 46:03.749
- Hiding out here?
- Not at all.

46:03.917 --> 46:06.416
Yeah right,
with everyone looking for you.

46:06.584 --> 46:08.041
Don't say you saw me.

46:08.209 --> 46:10.583
- Where are you crashing?
- At my father's.

46:10.750 --> 46:12.166
Got a father now?

46:14.500 --> 46:15.916
Got the money?

46:20.209 --> 46:22.083
- What's this?
- My father's place.

46:22.250 --> 46:23.083
He has a gym?

46:24.584 --> 46:25.833
Cool.

46:31.667 --> 46:33.333
From your mother.

46:36.584 --> 46:38.333
Your friends had to do that?

46:38.500 --> 46:41.374
They didn't have to.
But it worked.

46:41.542 --> 46:43.083
They're not my friends.

46:43.250 --> 46:45.583
Next time
tell them to come see me.

46:46.042 --> 46:47.666
Tell them yourself.

46:48.459 --> 46:52.249
And for your brother
and your mom's neighbor.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.166
Okay... and me?

46:54.459 --> 46:55.458
Later on.

46:55.625 --> 46:58.749
I came to the armpit of the world
for nothing?

47:04.167 --> 47:04.958
All I have.

47:05.125 --> 47:07.083
50 isn't enough for my gas!

47:07.250 --> 47:10.208
I bought you presents,
took you out...

47:10.375 --> 47:14.458
Restaurants, champagne in clubs,
you liked showing off.

47:15.417 --> 47:16.624
You really are...

47:16.792 --> 47:18.083
What am I?

47:19.875 --> 47:21.583
Too big a wimp to say.

47:23.125 --> 47:24.958
I don't want it to end badly.

47:25.292 --> 47:26.708
Stay away. I'm sick.

47:26.875 --> 47:29.333
- You're not cool.
- Yeah, and you are.

47:31.584 --> 47:33.416
Get out. I'm in a rush.

47:56.000 --> 47:56.999
Are you in pain?

47:57.167 --> 47:57.874
I'm okay.

48:04.709 --> 48:07.874
I was thinking,
with Championships coming up,

48:08.042 --> 48:11.124
maybe I should stay and help
a few more days.

48:12.167 --> 48:13.583
Same financial trouble?

48:14.375 --> 48:16.666
On the contrary.
I spend nothing here.

48:16.834 --> 48:20.583
With what you give me,
I put some aside.

48:22.334 --> 48:22.958
Good.

48:30.959 --> 48:32.833
- Thanks.
- You deserve it.

49:02.250 --> 49:05.833
Minus the 20%...
That comes to 1,120 euros.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.874
You save a whopping 280.

49:08.042 --> 49:09.791
A nice pair of shoes...

49:11.959 --> 49:14.791
What's more,
you get trained by champs.

49:14.959 --> 49:18.041
Vadim, five-time world champ.

49:18.209 --> 49:21.458
And Vincent Morel, Mr. Universe.
Real hotshots.

49:24.334 --> 49:27.999
Take a 10-second pause
and do 12 more.

49:31.542 --> 49:34.416
It's a gift. Here's my number.

49:34.584 --> 49:36.749
If you call me and pay in cash...

49:36.917 --> 49:38.333
I need a word.

49:39.084 --> 49:41.583
We'll discuss it later.
Look around.

49:42.500 --> 49:45.208
I need a word too.
About yearly discounts.

49:45.375 --> 49:47.833
Stop that on the double.
Here it's monthly.

49:49.084 --> 49:50.333
Come with me.

49:56.250 --> 49:59.124
There are complaints
of locker-room theft.

49:59.292 --> 50:00.416
Shit...

50:00.792 --> 50:04.624
One day some weird guys lingered
in the locker room.

50:05.084 --> 50:06.333
- Is it you?
- What?

50:06.500 --> 50:07.458
Answer me.

50:07.625 --> 50:10.458
- How dare you?
- You came and it began.

50:10.750 --> 50:13.958
Great logic.
Thugs come here and you accuse me?

50:14.250 --> 50:16.541
Answer my question. Is it you?

50:16.834 --> 50:20.166
Of course it's not me.
How can you imagine that?

50:20.334 --> 50:23.291
I do what you ask.
I clean up. I behave.

50:23.459 --> 50:24.541
No more bullshit.

50:24.834 --> 50:28.083
You have no confidence in me?
I'm disappointed.

50:35.334 --> 50:36.624
Sorry, with my diet...

50:36.875 --> 50:40.291
Diet or no diet, I'm your son.
You went overboard.

50:40.542 --> 50:41.791
And you hurt me.

50:42.667 --> 50:44.583
Sorry. Forget it happened.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.208
You barely get by.

51:37.375 --> 51:40.208
You can't afford another employee.

51:40.375 --> 51:42.958
Is it really the right time to hire?

51:43.125 --> 51:44.583
It's my son.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.499
He already works there.
But under the table.

51:49.334 --> 51:52.166
He has enough problems of his own.

51:53.125 --> 51:55.708
I thought
if I found him a stable job,

51:55.875 --> 51:58.208
it could motivate him to work.

51:59.500 --> 52:01.624
It's not easy nowadays for kids.

52:01.792 --> 52:02.791
I have children.

52:02.959 --> 52:04.041
Why not a loan?

52:04.334 --> 52:07.791
I'd advise you not to.
Borrow to hire, no way.

52:08.500 --> 52:11.249
You have a 56% debt ratio...

52:12.250 --> 52:13.999
The bank just refused a loan.

52:14.167 --> 52:16.833
I wanted to build a handicap ramp.

52:17.250 --> 52:20.958
And replace a couple of machines.
They wear out fast.

52:22.417 --> 52:23.458
Cancel that loan.

52:23.917 --> 52:26.041
What loan?
They turned it down.

52:26.500 --> 52:28.333
There's nothing to cancel.

52:28.500 --> 52:29.208
Change banks.

52:29.375 --> 52:33.291
They'll say the same thing.
It's the economy, not the bank.

52:33.625 --> 52:37.208
Banks won't loan,
insurers won't insure...

52:37.375 --> 52:39.666
So I keep paying him
under the table.

52:42.917 --> 52:44.874
I didn't say anything.

52:45.042 --> 52:46.999
Hear what you want, though.

52:47.167 --> 52:50.208
The only thing to do
is increase your capital.

52:50.792 --> 52:51.458
How?

52:51.625 --> 52:53.791
Get someone to invest in the gym

52:53.959 --> 52:56.666
and you keep running it.
That's no problem.

52:56.834 --> 52:59.916
The only solution I see
given your situation.

53:17.292 --> 53:18.541
What are you up to?

53:18.709 --> 53:20.499
I was in the neighborhood.

53:20.667 --> 53:23.833
Got pills that give muscles
without any work?

53:24.000 --> 53:26.333
You buy hash in a tobacco shop?

53:26.500 --> 53:28.124
No? Same goes here.

53:28.292 --> 53:29.666
Just checking.

53:30.959 --> 53:32.583
Don't need my help?

53:33.042 --> 53:35.041
No thanks, I'm fine.

53:36.667 --> 53:38.333
Want to have a drink?

53:39.125 --> 53:41.041
No, I have to go shopping.

53:41.459 --> 53:44.208
I'll come along.
We'll have a drink after.

53:46.167 --> 53:48.749
- I'm a stranger here.
- Poor thing.

53:48.959 --> 53:51.583
- 20 breasts as usual?
- Yes, please.

53:51.750 --> 53:53.249
And 20 for next week.

53:53.417 --> 53:54.958
It's already noted.

53:56.334 --> 53:59.499
Do you only eat chicken breasts
in this town?

54:03.667 --> 54:06.333
And guys... physically?

54:06.917 --> 54:09.624
You like them
more like my father or me?

54:09.792 --> 54:11.708
Whoever can put up with me.

54:11.875 --> 54:13.333
Are you grumpy?

54:14.042 --> 54:16.374
Like my father, while you diet?

54:16.625 --> 54:18.499
Not just while I diet.

54:19.042 --> 54:20.416
I don't believe you.

54:21.334 --> 54:23.916
Does your boyfriend say
you're grumpy?

54:24.625 --> 54:26.583
What are you getting at?

54:27.417 --> 54:30.583
Just chatting.
Getting to know each other.

54:31.250 --> 54:33.166
Why accept my invitation?

54:33.334 --> 54:36.249
You're Vincent's son.
He's someone I like.

54:36.500 --> 54:38.499
That's it? Because I'm his son?

54:38.667 --> 54:39.916
Yeah, that's it.

54:42.334 --> 54:44.583
You won't say
if you're seeing someone?

54:46.375 --> 54:47.666
You're exhausting.

54:47.959 --> 54:51.749
I think you're single.
You won't say, if ever I'm a pain.

54:51.917 --> 54:54.583
But I didn't come here
to hit on you.

55:06.334 --> 55:07.958
You don't want to eat?

55:08.125 --> 55:09.416
No, thanks.

55:16.042 --> 55:16.999
What kind of investment?

55:17.959 --> 55:19.249
Hedge fund. Swiss.

55:19.417 --> 55:20.416
Hedge what?

55:20.584 --> 55:23.624
They're investment funds.
I'll explain.

55:24.375 --> 55:27.458
Freaky little dolls.
You cut off their heads?

55:27.625 --> 55:30.166
Yes, as a kid.
They're very delicate.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.874
You can believe me.

55:38.042 --> 55:41.166
40% returns are... a rare find.

55:41.917 --> 55:45.416
You may never get an offer
like this in your life.

55:46.042 --> 55:47.499
Even if I had it...

55:47.709 --> 55:51.208
If it's too much,
invest half the amount.

55:51.375 --> 55:53.583
Put in whatever.
I'm not forcing you.

55:53.834 --> 55:56.333
I know nothing about that.
It's not my thing.

55:56.584 --> 55:59.999
Exactly.
Leave it to those in the know.

56:00.334 --> 56:03.166
Masters of the ins and outs
of finance.

56:04.625 --> 56:07.249
- Get a loan for the new store?
- Waiting.

56:07.709 --> 56:11.666
With what I'm offering,
you may not need one.

56:12.792 --> 56:16.583
I'll leave you time to think it over.
We'll meet later.

56:16.917 --> 56:18.833
Yeah, sounds like a plan.

56:42.542 --> 56:43.583
What now?

56:43.750 --> 56:46.374
Even back to the audience,
keep the pose.

56:46.625 --> 56:48.499
Judges keep looking.
Understand?

56:48.792 --> 56:49.583
Got it.

56:49.750 --> 56:51.249
- That's it.
- Hit play.

57:07.292 --> 57:08.916
- I'm done.
- You can go.

57:32.750 --> 57:36.583
I'm telling you as a friend,
I prefer we stop tonight.

57:36.750 --> 57:38.041
You're my coach,

57:38.209 --> 57:40.666
not my friend.
Who needs a friend to win?

57:40.834 --> 57:43.499
Your muscles need water.
You're quivering.

57:43.834 --> 57:45.291
It's eliminatory.

57:45.459 --> 57:48.124
Okay, Mr. Know-it-all.
Finish your spiel?

57:50.584 --> 57:51.208
Léa!

57:51.375 --> 57:54.124
Sorry, Vincent, I can't agree to this.

57:54.292 --> 57:56.499
Go home then! Why are you here?

57:56.709 --> 57:58.416
Muscles have memory.

57:58.584 --> 58:01.083
We have a competition.
Why am I dieting?

58:01.292 --> 58:03.249
I don't need you.
Go to your wife.

58:03.500 --> 58:04.833
Beat it!

58:06.167 --> 58:07.541
I don't need you.

58:10.625 --> 58:12.583
The body knows no limits.

58:12.792 --> 58:15.124
If you don't know it,
you're hopeless.

58:20.709 --> 58:21.333
Music.

58:22.417 --> 58:23.541
Maybe listen.

58:23.709 --> 58:26.249
Want to go too?
No one's helping?

58:27.584 --> 58:28.999
I'm all alone.

58:29.334 --> 58:31.458
Get out. I don't need anyone!

58:32.834 --> 58:34.291
Get lost, all of you.

58:35.125 --> 58:36.916
I'm fine all alone.

58:37.625 --> 58:41.333
I've never given up.
And I won't start today.

58:42.084 --> 58:43.541
I'm fine like this.

58:44.459 --> 58:45.624
I'll come in first.

59:01.834 --> 59:03.249
Can I have one?

59:08.750 --> 59:10.416
I'll save it for later.

59:10.959 --> 59:14.708
What happened?
I saw Vadim leave on his bike.

59:16.125 --> 59:17.916
Did you get in a fight?

59:19.500 --> 59:21.749
It's not easy dating an asshole.

59:22.084 --> 59:24.083
He's having a hard time.

59:24.250 --> 59:28.458
Easy or not... You work with kids.
You know about patience.

59:28.917 --> 59:31.666
He's worse than 30 kids!

59:32.167 --> 59:33.541
That says a lot.

59:35.125 --> 59:36.708
I hope he spoils you after.

59:37.417 --> 59:41.083
A nice little trip to the tropics
at the least!

59:41.959 --> 59:45.916
With what? It's spent on supplements.
Know what they cost?

59:46.084 --> 59:50.333
Think there's money to spare?
Nothing... he's broke.

59:50.959 --> 59:53.499
I even lent him 800 euros.

59:54.000 --> 59:55.541
Now I can't get operated.

59:56.209 --> 59:57.666
Get what operated?

59:58.500 --> 59:59.666
My breasts.

01:00:00.459 --> 01:00:02.666
You must have seen
how flat I am.

01:00:03.292 --> 01:00:07.166
I wanted to get operated in Tunisia.
It's cheaper there.

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:10.124
If he wins, he'll make money.

01:00:10.292 --> 01:00:12.291
Open your eyes.
There's no prize.

01:00:12.459 --> 01:00:13.083
Nothing?

01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:16.958
Yeah, a trophy
and a picture in the local paper.

01:00:17.334 --> 01:00:18.083
That's it?

01:00:18.250 --> 01:00:21.083
With some luck,
maybe the local news.

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:23.916
What did you think?
It's not the French Open!

01:00:24.625 --> 01:00:25.874
See you.

01:00:28.042 --> 01:00:29.416
Okay.

01:00:30.292 --> 01:00:31.333
So long.

01:01:49.417 --> 01:01:51.124
That's my freaking father.

01:02:01.125 --> 01:02:02.166
Antoine?

01:02:03.125 --> 01:02:04.333
Are you here?

01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:09.624
- Why are you here?
- For a DVD.

01:02:09.792 --> 01:02:10.999
Find one?

01:02:11.709 --> 01:02:13.958
Come on.
I don't want you in here.

01:02:20.584 --> 01:02:22.999
It smells like a gyro.
You eat a gyro?

01:02:23.292 --> 01:02:24.291
This afternoon.

01:02:24.459 --> 01:02:25.874
You're all pains!

01:02:26.042 --> 01:02:27.791
I don't eat before 9 pm.

01:02:27.959 --> 01:02:30.333
I smell it here,
right under my nose.

01:02:30.959 --> 01:02:32.583
I said no food here!

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:34.374
Léa isn't coming tonight?

01:02:34.542 --> 01:02:35.874
We got into a fight.

01:02:36.042 --> 01:02:38.458
- You mean for real?
- She'll be back.

01:03:01.667 --> 01:03:03.249
Any good? Can I taste?

01:03:04.834 --> 01:03:06.583
In fact, it's calculated.

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:10.416
Calculated gram by gram.

01:03:11.084 --> 01:03:12.083
I can't.

01:03:13.125 --> 01:03:14.333
Sure, I understand.

01:03:25.459 --> 01:03:27.583
First time we're watching a DVD...

01:03:28.167 --> 01:03:29.291
That's true.

01:03:30.875 --> 01:03:33.166
We haven't had many opportunities.

01:03:33.375 --> 01:03:35.458
We haven't had any at all.

01:03:39.667 --> 01:03:42.458
When you left Mom... how old was I?

01:03:43.917 --> 01:03:45.666
You mean when we divorced?

01:03:47.459 --> 01:03:48.708
You were...

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:50.583
How old are you now? 25?

01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:51.791
22.

01:03:52.792 --> 01:03:54.083
You were 3.

01:03:54.250 --> 01:03:55.458
Yeah, that's it.

01:03:56.875 --> 01:03:59.333
And before that? Do you remember?

01:04:00.667 --> 01:04:03.124
I wasn't there a lot, but of course.

01:04:03.667 --> 01:04:06.416
After my night shifts,
I'd go into your room

01:04:06.584 --> 01:04:08.249
and watch you two sleep.

01:04:09.292 --> 01:04:11.249
- His striations...
- His what?

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:13.874
- Striations on his back.
- I don't get it.

01:04:14.042 --> 01:04:15.958
That back, those veins...

01:04:16.459 --> 01:04:17.958
It makes him special.

01:04:18.125 --> 01:04:19.916
There's no stopping him.

01:04:20.292 --> 01:04:21.583
Why does it matter?

01:04:22.292 --> 01:04:24.624
A goal I set
5 years after my accident.

01:04:24.792 --> 01:04:26.583
But there's no prize money.

01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:27.749
It's useless.

01:04:27.917 --> 01:04:31.791
If I win, I'll say to myself:
I succeeded at something.

01:04:32.125 --> 01:04:33.374
I think I'd be proud.

01:04:35.584 --> 01:04:37.624
Why did you and Mom break up?

01:04:37.792 --> 01:04:39.541
We didn't get along.

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.166
Why were you together?

01:04:42.709 --> 01:04:43.708
Really want to know?

01:04:45.917 --> 01:04:47.791
She got pregnant.
We pretended.

01:04:54.084 --> 01:04:55.624
That life wasn't for me.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.083
So I left.

01:04:58.042 --> 01:04:59.666
She was hurt, made me pay.

01:05:01.834 --> 01:05:05.041
I wish I'd been closer to you
and your brother.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:06.124
I couldn't.

01:05:09.667 --> 01:05:10.958
Coming down?

01:05:13.584 --> 01:05:16.374
Not to mention when you were a teen.

01:05:16.542 --> 01:05:18.041
Remember your behavior?

01:05:18.209 --> 01:05:19.624
What do you mean?

01:05:19.875 --> 01:05:23.166
When I'd pick you up at school,
your mom would come.

01:05:23.334 --> 01:05:25.416
You'd head for her,
ignoring me.

01:05:25.584 --> 01:05:26.249
It was hard.

01:05:26.917 --> 01:05:29.166
I asked you to come on vacation once.

01:05:29.334 --> 01:05:30.624
You said no.

01:05:31.792 --> 01:05:33.333
After a while...

01:05:33.792 --> 01:05:34.624
I pulled away.

01:05:35.417 --> 01:05:36.208
I was 10.

01:05:36.375 --> 01:05:40.041
I know, but you really wanted
nothing to do with me.

01:05:40.209 --> 01:05:41.416
So it's my fault?

01:05:41.584 --> 01:05:42.708
I'm not blaming you.

01:05:43.042 --> 01:05:45.416
I'm just saying it affected me.

01:05:48.084 --> 01:05:50.249
You never visited
after my accident.

01:05:52.667 --> 01:05:55.541
Fathers often take the blame.
It's normal.

01:05:56.584 --> 01:05:58.208
I can understand that.

01:05:58.959 --> 01:05:59.708
But...

01:06:00.209 --> 01:06:02.166
I won't be around forever.

01:06:03.667 --> 01:06:05.291
What matters, in the end?

01:06:07.084 --> 01:06:10.291
We've rarely had time to talk,
but you never say

01:06:10.459 --> 01:06:12.333
a single nice thing about me.

01:06:13.542 --> 01:06:16.291
You're helping me now
so that I will?

01:06:17.459 --> 01:06:18.708
I give that impression?

01:06:18.875 --> 01:06:21.124
That I'm making up
for my mistakes?

01:06:21.292 --> 01:06:22.208
No, I don't.

01:06:22.375 --> 01:06:24.374
Nothing to make up for.
No need.

01:06:24.542 --> 01:06:25.916
We agree on that.

01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:29.124
Are we done? I need to sleep.

01:06:29.292 --> 01:06:31.458
I'm done. Anything to add?

01:06:31.625 --> 01:06:32.791
Not tonight.

01:06:33.292 --> 01:06:35.541
- See you tomorrow.
- Hit the lights.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.499
To me, you do this?

01:07:32.792 --> 01:07:35.749
You do drugs, lie!
And now steal from my gym?

01:07:36.875 --> 01:07:40.541
My customers, dammit!
Pascal has trained here for years!

01:07:41.792 --> 01:07:42.999
Piece of shit!

01:07:45.042 --> 01:07:46.791
Same as you.

01:07:46.959 --> 01:07:49.124
Don't preach
with the pills you pop!

01:07:49.667 --> 01:07:51.541
You're just as bad, drug-wise.

01:07:51.709 --> 01:07:55.083
Speed, painkillers, diuretics,
all that shit!

01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:58.374
It's Ali Baba's cave!
And just to look like this?

01:07:58.542 --> 01:08:00.874
You're rotten inside, always were.

01:08:01.042 --> 01:08:03.708
What do you think?
That you scare me?

01:08:03.875 --> 01:08:05.416
Want to fight?

01:08:07.292 --> 01:08:09.291
I never needed you to get by.

01:08:09.625 --> 01:08:11.083
I'll manage without you.

01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:36.541
They'd have found you anyway.

01:11:37.042 --> 01:11:38.874
You couldn't hide forever.

01:11:39.250 --> 01:11:42.291
You pay what you owe.
Only way to live in peace.

01:11:42.459 --> 01:11:44.208
They broke the garage lock.

01:11:45.459 --> 01:11:46.541
Give me the keys.

01:11:47.875 --> 01:11:49.291
Give it back to Pascal.

01:11:49.459 --> 01:11:53.041
- How did you find it?
- I have it. That's what matters.

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:55.499
Tell everyone who was robbed

01:11:55.667 --> 01:11:58.166
we found the thief
and will pay them back.

01:12:03.042 --> 01:12:04.624
The key to the basement.

01:12:06.917 --> 01:12:08.333
I'll put it away.

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:10.124
You don't mind?

01:12:14.084 --> 01:12:15.374
No problem.

01:12:16.042 --> 01:12:17.583
Still looking for a gym?

01:12:18.667 --> 01:12:19.624
How do you know?

01:12:19.792 --> 01:12:20.624
People talk.

01:12:21.209 --> 01:12:22.833
I won't buy nearby.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:23.791
Partners?

01:12:25.209 --> 01:12:28.208
Buy half my business.
50-50. Jointly run.

01:12:30.250 --> 01:12:32.583
- I'll ask Sandra.
- That's normal.

01:12:34.542 --> 01:12:35.791
But...

01:12:36.125 --> 01:12:38.416
- It's my dream.
- Makes me happy too.

01:12:38.917 --> 01:12:40.583
Thanks, Vincent...

01:12:58.417 --> 01:13:00.541
We woke you. I'm sorry.

01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:01.874
You shave it all?

01:13:02.042 --> 01:13:03.916
Judges don't want body hair.

01:13:04.084 --> 01:13:06.208
The muscles have to be highlighted.

01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:09.083
And I have to admit,
it feels great.

01:13:09.250 --> 01:13:11.708
There's laser hair removal.
Permanent.

01:13:12.375 --> 01:13:14.249
- Why not?
- He doesn't like it.

01:13:14.417 --> 01:13:15.833
Don't speak for me.

01:13:16.167 --> 01:13:17.249
It's a pain.

01:13:17.417 --> 01:13:19.624
And it costs a fortune.
I can't.

01:13:20.250 --> 01:13:21.791
Long procedure too.

01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:24.249
Shaving is nothing.

01:13:24.667 --> 01:13:26.666
Because you don't do it!

01:13:27.250 --> 01:13:28.708
She's nice to you.

01:13:28.875 --> 01:13:30.124
She sure is.

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:32.333
I deserve it.

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:34.583
Of course you have to spoil it.

01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:36.249
I was expecting it.

01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:39.249
He's not big on compliments.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.041
Turn around.

01:13:45.459 --> 01:13:46.124
Pecs.

01:13:51.375 --> 01:13:52.624
87 kilos.

01:13:52.959 --> 01:13:54.541
I thought we'd be higher.

01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:56.666
No, it's good. We're fine.

01:13:58.042 --> 01:14:00.333
You were at 400 egg whites a week.

01:14:00.667 --> 01:14:02.916
Now we'll up the carbohydrates.

01:14:03.292 --> 01:14:04.249
So more carbs.

01:14:12.167 --> 01:14:13.541
I was better last year.

01:14:16.625 --> 01:14:17.749
6 percent.

01:14:21.709 --> 01:14:22.833
A centimeter more.

01:14:24.167 --> 01:14:25.916
41... It's in your head.

01:14:28.167 --> 01:14:29.374
We did good.

01:14:30.209 --> 01:14:33.083
- Not bad.
- No water until Championships.

01:15:04.167 --> 01:15:05.333
What you asked for.

01:15:05.834 --> 01:15:07.791
Make sure you pay them back.

01:15:10.292 --> 01:15:10.999
Don't steal it.

01:15:11.167 --> 01:15:12.624
I got it, Dad.

01:15:15.375 --> 01:15:17.208
Your brother's waiting.

01:15:19.042 --> 01:15:20.749
See you at Championships.

01:15:20.917 --> 01:15:21.999
If you want.

01:15:23.667 --> 01:15:24.666
Travel safely.

01:15:26.917 --> 01:15:29.208
- I'm counting on you.
- Don't worry.

01:15:31.334 --> 01:15:32.374
Later, Vadim.

01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:42.416
Vincent...

01:15:43.334 --> 01:15:44.541
Hello, Sandra.

01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:46.333
- How are you?
- Fine.

01:15:47.292 --> 01:15:50.041
Have you decided
about the apartment?

01:15:50.292 --> 01:15:51.083
How so?

01:15:51.709 --> 01:15:54.124
It's in the contract.
We have a great idea.

01:15:54.292 --> 01:15:55.791
A beauty salon.

01:15:56.125 --> 01:15:58.249
The works: manicure, pedicure,

01:15:58.417 --> 01:16:00.166
facials, massage.

01:16:00.875 --> 01:16:01.499
So?

01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:08.208
Come see the locker room.

01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:10.291
We need to talk.

01:16:11.625 --> 01:16:15.499
- Vadim, you're my partner not her.
- Of course.

01:16:16.167 --> 01:16:17.791
If not, we call it off.

01:16:18.542 --> 01:16:22.041
Don't worry.
She's excited but she'll calm down.

01:16:22.209 --> 01:16:23.291
If you say so.

01:16:28.834 --> 01:16:30.416
Keeping an eye on me?

01:16:39.542 --> 01:16:41.499
- Did he ever hit you?
- A slap?

01:16:44.125 --> 01:16:46.291
One or twice, maybe. I forget.

01:16:47.709 --> 01:16:49.041
He slapped me good.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:50.666
Really?

01:16:52.125 --> 01:16:53.458
And it was nice.

01:16:54.375 --> 01:16:55.666
You liked it?

01:16:56.250 --> 01:16:57.208
I was reeling!

01:17:00.209 --> 01:17:02.708
Only 300? That's no good!

01:17:03.417 --> 01:17:04.624
Fuck your 200!

01:17:04.792 --> 01:17:06.666
You used my money, so pay.

01:17:07.084 --> 01:17:08.124
We're not fools.

01:17:08.292 --> 01:17:09.458
And my 400?

01:17:16.167 --> 01:17:18.583
- I owed him 300.
- Fucking pain.

01:17:18.875 --> 01:17:19.916
No gains?

01:17:20.417 --> 01:17:21.499
Like we said.

01:17:21.667 --> 01:17:23.666
Give me 100 more
and it's over.

01:17:26.917 --> 01:17:28.749
Your money.
Not 300, just 200.

01:17:29.167 --> 01:17:29.874
Not like he said.

01:17:30.042 --> 01:17:30.874
Not cool.

01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:32.166
No interest?

01:17:32.542 --> 01:17:34.333
- We said 300.
- I know.

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:36.291
160 plus 40 makes 200.

01:17:36.584 --> 01:17:37.208
Missing 100.

01:17:37.375 --> 01:17:39.416
Recouping my money is normal.

01:17:39.792 --> 01:17:40.708
And the rest?

01:17:40.875 --> 01:17:42.458
Your brother is bullshit.

01:17:42.625 --> 01:17:43.333
I told him.

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:45.499
He screwed up. He's sorry.

01:17:45.667 --> 01:17:46.833
We agreed to 300.

01:17:47.417 --> 01:17:48.374
Understand?

01:17:48.542 --> 01:17:49.916
- Why?
- He owes everyone.

01:17:50.084 --> 01:17:53.124
Butt out, man.
100 more and call it quits.

01:17:53.542 --> 01:17:55.541
Give him 100 and drop it.

01:17:55.875 --> 01:17:56.541
You going?

01:18:00.834 --> 01:18:01.458
Beat it.

01:18:01.625 --> 01:18:02.583
Two clowns.

01:18:14.875 --> 01:18:16.166
The envelope.

01:18:20.667 --> 01:18:21.333
Stay put.

01:18:25.709 --> 01:18:27.499
Hey... is Luigi here?

01:18:27.667 --> 01:18:28.666
Not in.

01:18:29.834 --> 01:18:31.166
- Where is he?
- No idea.

01:18:37.834 --> 01:18:39.666
You want something?

01:18:41.250 --> 01:18:42.624
Tell him I came by.

01:18:42.792 --> 01:18:44.333
- I'll tell him.
- Do it.

01:18:46.167 --> 01:18:47.708
Not here.

01:18:49.042 --> 01:18:49.999
We'll come back.

01:18:52.334 --> 01:18:54.083
We finished with everyone?

01:18:54.250 --> 01:18:56.124
- I'll drop you off.
- I'll walk.

01:18:56.292 --> 01:18:58.041
- Don't see Luigi alone.
- Relax.

01:18:58.209 --> 01:19:00.249
Don't say relax.
Don't come alone.

01:19:01.875 --> 01:19:02.791
Kiss the girls.

01:19:02.959 --> 01:19:05.041
- You'll see them tonight.
- Cool.

01:19:12.667 --> 01:19:13.916
Unbelievable.

01:19:17.542 --> 01:19:19.958
You didn't know
he'd become like that?

01:19:20.334 --> 01:19:22.874
He loved that stuff but I didn't...

01:19:25.334 --> 01:19:27.041
I don't even recognize him.

01:19:27.209 --> 01:19:28.541
Show me.

01:19:28.792 --> 01:19:30.166
You get used to it.

01:19:30.584 --> 01:19:31.666
Amazing!

01:19:32.042 --> 01:19:34.458
- Come tonight to the show.
- Not me.

01:19:34.625 --> 01:19:37.124
- It could be fun.
- You find it fun?

01:19:37.292 --> 01:19:39.374
Guys in strings flexing muscles.

01:19:39.542 --> 01:19:40.291
Honestly.

01:19:40.459 --> 01:19:41.374
So forget it.

01:19:41.542 --> 01:19:43.416
I won't go anyway. Coffee?

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:49.958
He looks great.

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:52.499
Yeah but...

01:19:52.750 --> 01:19:55.124
to be like that
you need 8 meals a day.

01:19:56.042 --> 01:19:57.624
I can eat 15 a day.

01:19:57.792 --> 01:20:00.999
Not meals like this.
No sauces, no wine...

01:20:01.417 --> 01:20:03.791
He eats 300-400 eggs a week.

01:20:03.959 --> 01:20:05.166
Nonstop workouts,

01:20:05.334 --> 01:20:07.541
tons of pills... BCAA,

01:20:07.917 --> 01:20:10.124
boosters, powdered protein.

01:20:10.292 --> 01:20:11.624
And exercise too.

01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:13.749
Exercise too?

01:20:13.917 --> 01:20:15.166
Not for me.

01:20:55.959 --> 01:20:57.499
You have any projects?

01:20:59.959 --> 01:21:01.416
I'll think about it.

01:21:02.625 --> 01:21:04.249
Big change...

01:21:05.917 --> 01:21:07.583
Actually I have an idea.

01:21:08.709 --> 01:21:10.874
If I can rent the space downstairs.

01:21:11.042 --> 01:21:12.291
It's tiny. What for?

01:21:12.459 --> 01:21:15.083
There's no nutrition store in the area.

01:21:15.250 --> 01:21:17.916
A girl I know has one. She can help.

01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:21.499
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:21:22.167 --> 01:21:23.624
What's that?

01:21:26.459 --> 01:21:27.874
Can I keep it?

01:21:30.542 --> 01:21:31.249
Of course.

01:21:39.250 --> 01:21:41.499
We came by, but you were out.

01:21:41.917 --> 01:21:43.791
I have everything. I'm coming.

01:21:44.292 --> 01:21:46.374
- I'm running an errand.
- Where?

01:21:47.292 --> 01:21:48.499
Be right back!

01:21:50.709 --> 01:21:52.874
Fred, it's Antoine. Call me back.

01:22:59.292 --> 01:23:00.583
The CD, please.

01:23:00.750 --> 01:23:01.749
Eye of the Tiger.

01:23:04.125 --> 01:23:05.833
- Name?
- Vincent Morel.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:06.916
Masters 50+.

01:23:07.084 --> 01:23:08.624
Very good. Got it.

01:23:08.792 --> 01:23:10.208
Vincent Morel, I heard.

01:23:10.375 --> 01:23:11.041
Number 12.

01:23:11.292 --> 01:23:13.041
It goes on the right.

01:23:13.209 --> 01:23:14.708
- Your age?
- 58.

01:23:14.875 --> 01:23:16.374
- From?
- St. Etienne.

01:23:20.209 --> 01:23:22.583
- Where are you going?
- To see Luigi.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:23.833
He's not in.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.916
Merco, let him in.

01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:29.666
Got the money?

01:23:36.625 --> 01:23:37.749
He's in back.

01:23:46.959 --> 01:23:48.583
Hey, stranger!

01:23:49.042 --> 01:23:50.291
What got into you?

01:23:50.459 --> 01:23:52.166
You ran off. We like you.

01:23:52.334 --> 01:23:53.874
There's only 2,000.

01:23:55.084 --> 01:23:57.083
- What did I put in?
- 2,000.

01:23:57.625 --> 01:23:59.666
- What did you promise?
- I know.

01:23:59.834 --> 01:24:00.874
It didn't work out.

01:24:01.042 --> 01:24:02.583
That's your problem.

01:24:02.792 --> 01:24:03.583
What about me?

01:24:04.042 --> 01:24:06.333
I can't pay more. I swear.

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:08.208
It's all I can do, no more.

01:24:08.584 --> 01:24:10.749
You broke my TV,
took my computer.

01:24:10.917 --> 01:24:11.624
What the fuck?

01:24:11.792 --> 01:24:13.958
I busted your TV,
took your computer?

01:24:14.125 --> 01:24:17.208
- Did you bust his TV?
- No way. I'm innocent.

01:24:17.375 --> 01:24:18.791
And he calls us thieves!

01:24:19.084 --> 01:24:20.916
Hear that, Mira?

01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:24.041
He's shitting us.
What do we do, Mira?

01:24:24.209 --> 01:24:25.958
We can give him 2 weeks.

01:24:27.042 --> 01:24:28.499
No, you're right.

01:24:29.334 --> 01:24:30.958
Hunting him down is a pain.

01:24:32.417 --> 01:24:34.541
Or else:
punish you as you deserve.

01:24:35.375 --> 01:24:36.999
Right, Mira? Punish him?

01:24:38.417 --> 01:24:40.083
2 weeks. I'll find 1,000.

01:24:40.250 --> 01:24:41.708
Relax, relax...

01:24:42.542 --> 01:24:43.999
She made up her mind.

01:24:44.167 --> 01:24:44.999
You filming?

01:24:45.375 --> 01:24:46.499
Action.

01:24:51.042 --> 01:24:52.041
You'll pay up?

01:24:54.334 --> 01:24:55.916
Where are you going?

01:24:56.084 --> 01:24:57.499
Two more blows.

01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:16.958
- And Antoine?
- No answer.

01:25:20.292 --> 01:25:21.041
Glad you came.

01:25:21.375 --> 01:25:23.083
Let's hear your support.

01:25:23.250 --> 01:25:26.374
They're dehydrated
and have dieted for 3 months

01:25:27.042 --> 01:25:29.083
to be here tonight with you.

01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:30.749
Let's cheer them on!

01:25:31.917 --> 01:25:34.249
Gentlemen, you may go backstage.

01:26:05.125 --> 01:26:06.624
Why are you laughing?

01:26:06.792 --> 01:26:08.624
At sports games as a kid,

01:26:08.792 --> 01:26:10.624
fathers cheered on their sons.

01:26:11.542 --> 01:26:12.666
I was so envious.

01:26:13.125 --> 01:26:15.333
Now I'm filming my dad,
not my kid.

01:26:15.875 --> 01:26:18.083
Anyway... it made me laugh.

01:26:21.834 --> 01:26:24.458
Let's cheer them on.
They deserve it!

01:26:24.625 --> 01:26:26.249
Turn around, ladies.

01:26:29.292 --> 01:26:31.333
What a wonderful category!

01:26:37.417 --> 01:26:39.958
- Time?
- 2 minutes more than the last time.

01:26:40.167 --> 01:26:41.583
I don't get it.

01:26:41.875 --> 01:26:43.458
Maybe he got held up.

01:26:43.834 --> 01:26:45.374
That's not what I mean.

01:26:45.834 --> 01:26:46.583
So?

01:26:46.875 --> 01:26:48.083
I'll go check.

01:26:51.125 --> 01:26:53.041
You okay? Not too cold?

01:26:53.209 --> 01:26:53.833
I'm fine.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.833
It's drafty back here.

01:26:56.417 --> 01:26:58.583
I'm fine. I'm not cold.

01:26:59.709 --> 01:27:01.416
Want a puff?

01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:04.749
Would a kiss distract you?

01:27:05.584 --> 01:27:06.833
Can I do it anyway?

01:27:12.292 --> 01:27:16.999
Everyone's favorite category!
Here's number 3, from Strasbourg.

01:27:19.042 --> 01:27:20.708
He's a pain for not coming.

01:27:20.875 --> 01:27:22.208
To make him happy.

01:27:22.959 --> 01:27:24.958
Pull, Vincent.

01:27:25.709 --> 01:27:26.499
Pushups.

01:27:44.375 --> 01:27:46.124
Thank you, ladies.

01:27:46.292 --> 01:27:47.541
You may leave the stage

01:27:47.709 --> 01:27:49.458
while everyone cheers you on.

01:27:49.625 --> 01:27:52.624
You'll see these lovely ladies later

01:27:52.917 --> 01:27:54.416
for their solo acts.

01:27:54.584 --> 01:27:56.749
And now,
a warm round of applause,

01:27:56.917 --> 01:27:59.333
which they really deserve...

01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:00.999
Bring down the house!

01:28:01.167 --> 01:28:04.291
The category Men's Masters
under 85 kilos.

01:28:04.459 --> 01:28:06.583
Gentlemen, take the stage.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.374
Twenty athletes here tonight,

01:28:11.542 --> 01:28:13.833
in Master's under 85 kilos.

01:28:18.042 --> 01:28:19.999
Front double biceps!

01:28:20.167 --> 01:28:21.624
Show some support!

01:28:21.792 --> 01:28:23.666
They are over 50 years old!

01:28:23.959 --> 01:28:26.291
Years of training
to be here tonight.

01:28:27.959 --> 01:28:29.458
Chest, gentlemen.

01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:36.083
Your best profile,

01:28:36.459 --> 01:28:37.791
biceps, chest.

01:28:40.334 --> 01:28:41.541
Backs to the judges.

01:28:41.709 --> 01:28:43.499
One leg behind...

01:28:43.667 --> 01:28:44.874
Rear double biceps.

01:29:20.834 --> 01:29:22.249
Plant your legs.

01:29:22.417 --> 01:29:23.291
When you pose,

01:29:23.584 --> 01:29:25.124
get on your tiptoes.

01:29:25.292 --> 01:29:26.333
My tiptoes.

01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:27.374
Exactly.

01:29:28.959 --> 01:29:30.291
Relax a little now.

01:29:30.667 --> 01:29:32.749
- You were great.
- Really?

01:29:32.917 --> 01:29:34.791
Yeah, really. Want to see?

01:29:35.250 --> 01:29:36.583
You filmed it?

01:29:42.334 --> 01:29:44.083
His face, when he contracts...

01:29:44.584 --> 01:29:46.208
Shitting razor blades.

01:29:47.584 --> 01:29:48.458
Stay concentrated.

01:29:57.209 --> 01:29:58.916
Where the hell are you?

01:29:59.084 --> 01:30:00.749
Dad's almost done and...

01:30:01.334 --> 01:30:03.416
I thought you'd come.
Call back.

01:30:03.584 --> 01:30:04.666
Later.

01:30:08.625 --> 01:30:09.958
Breathe in.

01:30:11.959 --> 01:30:12.958
Yowza.

01:30:14.417 --> 01:30:15.041
Pretty.

01:30:15.209 --> 01:30:16.833
It's not too tight?

01:30:17.250 --> 01:30:18.208
Sorry.

01:30:18.375 --> 01:30:19.791
I got his voicemail.

01:30:20.209 --> 01:30:21.541
I doubt he'll come.

01:30:22.417 --> 01:30:25.166
No idea why.
You won't see him for a while.

01:30:26.709 --> 01:30:27.499
Selfish.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.416
Maybe it's better.

01:30:29.584 --> 01:30:32.166
Our next athlete
is also from Gym and Co,

01:30:32.334 --> 01:30:34.583
Number 12.

01:30:34.750 --> 01:30:36.416
Vincent Morel.

01:30:36.584 --> 01:30:38.083
Vincent, it's all yours!

01:32:08.709 --> 01:32:09.958
Applause, please!

01:32:10.125 --> 01:32:14.041
58 years old,
the great Vincent Morel.

01:32:14.209 --> 01:32:15.416
Thank you, Vincent.

01:32:18.250 --> 01:32:20.833
That was some performance!
Gorgeous!

01:32:21.209 --> 01:32:23.249
Our next athlete...

01:32:23.834 --> 01:32:25.124
I messed up.

01:32:25.584 --> 01:32:27.291
I couldn't fit it all in.

01:32:27.459 --> 01:32:28.499
You were great.

01:32:29.250 --> 01:32:31.374
Who knew
I'd freak out so much?

01:32:31.625 --> 01:32:32.791
You were perfect.

01:32:32.959 --> 01:32:34.374
How did Richard do?

01:32:34.625 --> 01:32:35.499
Not bad.

01:32:36.459 --> 01:32:37.166
Nothing new.

01:32:37.417 --> 01:32:38.999
You have to put on a show.

01:32:39.167 --> 01:32:41.166
Yeah, with your costume...

01:32:41.459 --> 01:32:43.749
the striptease...
It was very good.

01:32:43.917 --> 01:32:44.916
I'm not worried.

01:32:45.084 --> 01:32:46.333
Don't catch cold.

01:32:51.084 --> 01:32:53.583
The judges aren't ready.

01:32:54.084 --> 01:32:57.791
Very difficult
to choose among the top three.

01:32:58.417 --> 01:32:59.416
For the prizes,

01:32:59.584 --> 01:33:03.374
I'll call only
3rd place, 2nd place and first.

01:33:03.542 --> 01:33:06.499
Third, second and first in that order.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.374
Tonight, in third place,

01:33:11.542 --> 01:33:13.708
contestant number... 5!

01:33:13.875 --> 01:33:16.333
Didier Cagnard!

01:33:16.667 --> 01:33:18.208
Give him some applause.

01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:19.583
Wonderful!

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.666
Second place tonight...

01:33:25.834 --> 01:33:27.541
number 18,

01:33:27.709 --> 01:33:29.749
Richard Chantome!

01:33:31.625 --> 01:33:33.083
He'll come in first.

01:33:33.375 --> 01:33:35.083
A unanimous decision.

01:33:35.250 --> 01:33:37.166
And tonight's winner,

01:33:37.334 --> 01:33:40.249
in the category
Masters under 85 kilos,

01:33:40.417 --> 01:33:42.791
contestant number... 7,

01:33:42.959 --> 01:33:45.291
Stephane Petillot!

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.958
Let's cheer him on! Excellent job!

01:33:51.375 --> 01:33:54.583
Congratulations to the winners,
but they all deserve it.

01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:00.749
- I'll go see him.
- I'll come along.

01:34:01.542 --> 01:34:03.708
Congratulations all 3,
and to Stephane!

01:34:04.792 --> 01:34:06.999
I don't think
I had what they wanted.

01:34:07.292 --> 01:34:08.041
But...

01:34:08.792 --> 01:34:10.124
I'm glad for Richard.

01:34:10.292 --> 01:34:11.583
He deserves it.

01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:14.166
You deserve it as much as him.

01:34:14.334 --> 01:34:16.041
They wanted someone big.

01:34:16.209 --> 01:34:17.874
Richard's bigger than me.

01:34:18.750 --> 01:34:20.333
How did he end up 2nd?

01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:21.624
Don't be negative.

01:34:21.792 --> 01:34:24.666
But 2nd?
And how did they pick the winner?

01:34:25.125 --> 01:34:26.541
We did our best.

01:34:27.042 --> 01:34:30.041
Now it's becoming...
too exhausting for me.

01:34:32.417 --> 01:34:35.416
Thanks to the crew, all volunteers,

01:34:35.584 --> 01:34:36.874
who have helped out...

01:34:54.250 --> 01:34:55.208
Antoine?

01:34:55.375 --> 01:34:56.791
What happened?

01:34:57.667 --> 01:34:58.916
Who did that?

01:34:59.459 --> 01:35:00.374
Luigi.

01:35:00.542 --> 01:35:01.749
You didn't pay him?

01:35:01.917 --> 01:35:03.541
Yes. But he didn't agree.

01:35:04.167 --> 01:35:05.124
You really paid?

01:35:05.292 --> 01:35:06.249
I swear I did.

01:35:06.542 --> 01:35:08.708
You paid and he did that?

01:35:09.167 --> 01:35:10.791
Look what that fucker did!

01:35:12.542 --> 01:35:14.166
- You didn't pay?
- I did.

01:35:14.334 --> 01:35:15.291
You didn't win?

01:35:18.584 --> 01:35:19.833
This can't go on.

01:35:28.625 --> 01:35:30.624
What will you tell them?

01:35:31.459 --> 01:35:32.541
I don't know.

01:35:34.167 --> 01:35:37.541
Fred, are you sure they're not armed?

01:35:37.959 --> 01:35:39.458
Bunch of jerk-offs.

01:35:40.834 --> 01:35:43.666
Should we let the police
deal with this?

01:35:44.084 --> 01:35:46.499
We'll settle it first, then see.

01:36:11.542 --> 01:36:14.124
- We're closed.
- Where's Luigi?

01:36:15.417 --> 01:36:17.541
Get your boss or we will.

01:36:21.167 --> 01:36:23.624
Come out.
The Expendables are here.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.041
- What?
- I said to come out!

01:36:27.042 --> 01:36:29.916
What the hell? I'm doing my books.

01:36:34.667 --> 01:36:35.749
It's about my son.

01:36:36.042 --> 01:36:37.999
- Don't know him.
- Yes, you do.

01:36:38.167 --> 01:36:40.499
I think you got too close to him.

01:36:41.042 --> 01:36:42.291
Time to give up.

01:36:42.917 --> 01:36:44.791
He paid you back,
did his duty.

01:36:45.125 --> 01:36:47.874
I lent him money.
I want my interest.

01:36:48.042 --> 01:36:49.874
You trashed his apartment.

01:36:50.042 --> 01:36:50.708
We're even.

01:36:50.917 --> 01:36:52.958
We broke our asses
to pay you back.

01:36:53.667 --> 01:36:55.291
So I'm saying it nicely:

01:36:55.459 --> 01:36:56.333
keep away.

01:36:56.500 --> 01:36:58.666
You and your dumb sheep.

01:36:58.834 --> 01:37:00.416
If you see him or Fred,

01:37:00.584 --> 01:37:02.833
walk the other way.

01:37:03.334 --> 01:37:03.958
Get it?

01:37:06.875 --> 01:37:07.666
I didn't hear.

01:37:08.125 --> 01:37:09.333
You hear anything?

01:37:16.042 --> 01:37:17.916
I'll make an exception.

01:37:18.375 --> 01:37:19.958
But it can't happen again.

01:37:20.125 --> 01:37:22.416
I knew you were a smart guy.

01:37:24.792 --> 01:37:25.416
Let's go.

01:37:29.875 --> 01:37:30.749
I almost forgot.

01:37:31.042 --> 01:37:34.041
If you want to come to the gym,
feel free.

01:37:46.459 --> 01:37:48.499
Did you see that hulk?

01:37:49.334 --> 01:37:50.791
And that one's calves?

01:37:50.959 --> 01:37:53.083
What calves, what hulk?

01:37:53.250 --> 01:37:54.999
Bunch of hicks.

01:37:55.167 --> 01:37:58.124
Iron pumpers.
3 months and I'd look like that.

01:38:25.792 --> 01:38:27.124
What are you doing?

01:38:27.542 --> 01:38:28.916
Want to kill me?

01:38:29.334 --> 01:38:31.416
It's nothing. I almost let go.

01:38:33.042 --> 01:38:34.374
I didn't know.

01:38:35.334 --> 01:38:36.666
I meant to tell you.

01:38:36.834 --> 01:38:38.999
- How far along?
- 4 and a half months.

01:38:39.167 --> 01:38:41.249
We wanted to know
if it's a girl or boy.

01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:43.958
- And?
- A girl.

01:38:45.417 --> 01:38:46.541
Are you upset?

01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:48.416
Tell me. It's not easy.

01:38:48.584 --> 01:38:49.583
I understand.

01:38:50.125 --> 01:38:52.624
No, it's good news but it's weird.

01:38:53.084 --> 01:38:54.374
I agree.

01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:58.291
Let's do a series of 10.

01:38:59.167 --> 01:39:01.083
Back against the wall,
legs bent.

01:39:01.667 --> 01:39:03.166
- What is it?
- I'm done.

01:39:03.334 --> 01:39:05.208
I have to return the car.

01:39:05.375 --> 01:39:07.166
- No shoulders?
- I'm late.

01:39:07.334 --> 01:39:08.416
A sister's cool.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.333
When will you be back?

01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:12.791
In a week.
