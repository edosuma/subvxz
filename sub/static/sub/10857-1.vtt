00:43.154 --> 00:45.018
Hey, let me in!

02:12.197 --> 02:13.011
Professor Cutter!

02:15.830 --> 02:16.859
Professor!

02:16.894 --> 02:18.492
Professor Cutter...

02:18.527 --> 02:20.100
Connor Temple.

02:20.135 --> 02:21.402
I'm sorry, I've never heard of it.

02:21.403 --> 02:23.538
I think you want archeology, if you go
around that way

02:23.538 --> 02:25.638
to the right and keep
walking it's on your left.

02:25.673 --> 02:27.998
It's not a place, it's my name.
I'm one of your student.

02:29.617 --> 02:30.240
Really?

02:30.283 --> 02:32.148
Why... why don't I recognize you?

02:35.766 --> 02:37.461
I've never actually turned up for the seminars.

02:46.374 --> 02:47.709
Professor!

02:56.669 --> 02:57.461
Don't touch anything.

02:57.468 --> 03:00.932
This is my laboratory technician,
Stephen Hart.

03:00.966 --> 03:02.133
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:06.488 --> 03:07.753
Actually, that's my dissertation.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.470
Yeah.

03:09.486 --> 03:12.203
See, I argue the all life on earth

03:12.206 --> 03:15.081
derive from organisms carried
by alien spacecraft.

03:15.125 --> 03:17.033
It's pretty sexy stuff.

03:20.267 --> 03:21.183
It's a work in progress.

03:21.217 --> 03:22.031
Really.

03:22.075 --> 03:25.500
Tell me... what this is.

03:27.218 --> 03:27.671
A fish?

03:28.488 --> 03:29.262
Obviously.

03:30.126 --> 03:31.671
This is sarcopterygian.

03:31.716 --> 03:35.102
There's no trace of him in the fossil
record for 17 million years...

03:35.135 --> 03:38.142
and then suddenly one just pops out
in the middle of the Indian Ocean.

03:38.187 --> 03:42.243
Totally inexplicable
in modern evolutionary terms.

03:42.275 --> 03:45.431
Darwin provides most
of the answers.

03:45.475 --> 03:48.931
It's the pieces that don't fit

03:48.968 --> 03:50.441
that interest me.

03:50.487 --> 03:52.382
See, that's why I was wondering
whether you'd seen this.

03:54.275 --> 03:57.131
Some sort of giant
undiscovered predator.

04:01.607 --> 04:04.502
Oh! No no no no.
This, this is the real thing.

04:04.515 --> 04:09.942
Connor, you should get a life,
go to a bar, meet a nice a girl

04:09.978 --> 04:11.933
Life will seem a lot less confusing.

04:11.966 --> 04:15.063
I've already got a girlfriend.
Sort of.

04:15.107 --> 04:17.021
It does not, really...

04:17.057 --> 04:20.103
The point is there's an eye witness,
he claims to have seen it.

04:20.148 --> 04:22.123
People claim to have seen the Lochness monster.

04:22.157 --> 04:23.363
It doesn't mean that it's there.

04:23.407 --> 04:26.343
Not now. Obviously,
'cause it died years ago.

04:26.377 --> 04:28.893
The goverment hid the
body away, they covered the whole thing up.

04:28.938 --> 04:31.722
This is just a hoax.
Forget it.

04:32.957 --> 04:34.070
Your wife wouldn't have
ignored it.

04:40.587 --> 04:42.190
My wife was a serious
scientist.

04:42.228 --> 04:47.682
She wasn't some gullible, monster hunter.

04:48.558 --> 04:49.473
Sorry.

04:49.505 --> 04:50.942
It's ok.

04:50.988 --> 04:52.421
I just thought you might...

04:52.466 --> 04:55.171
wanna check it out, that's all.

04:56.476 --> 04:58.752
It's not as the Forest of Dean
is far away though.

05:01.197 --> 05:02.190
The Forest of Dean?

05:06.068 --> 05:07.740
If we leave now,
we could be there by lunch.

05:30.625 --> 05:32.403
Come on guys, what are you
waiting for?

05:32.447 --> 05:34.831
Some *** and a Frank Sinatra record?

05:39.708 --> 05:41.101
How are Brad and Angelina?

05:41.145 --> 05:43.653
Totally gay,
but otherwise fine.

05:43.698 --> 05:45.450
They should be mating by now.

05:45.487 --> 05:47.433
Maybe they just don't fancy each other.

05:49.108 --> 05:50.863
Abby... a word.

05:58.898 --> 05:59.680
Abby I'm sorry.

05:59.716 --> 06:02.352
The sponsors pulled out and I...

06:02.388 --> 06:04.991
I have to slim down the reptile
program.

06:08.688 --> 06:11.482
And my jobs plumbs under the
heading of instant loss, right?

06:15.847 --> 06:17.401
There's an attachment
going on the *** house.

06:17.445 --> 06:18.750
I can put in a word for you.

06:18.785 --> 06:20.753
I'm a lizard girl Tim, and you
know that.

06:24.605 --> 06:25.162
Hello, Tim Parker.

06:26.625 --> 06:28.343
W hat?
I'll call you back, ok.

06:28.375 --> 06:29.212
Ok, bye.

06:29.245 --> 06:32.422
Letters. From people wanting
the zoo to collect their animals.

06:32.425 --> 06:35.601
Why do people buy exotic pets
if they don't want them?

06:39.985 --> 06:40.643
Everything alright?

06:40.686 --> 06:43.130
I'll handle this if you'd like.
It's my field.

06:43.167 --> 06:45.223
I know the Forest of Dean pretty well.

06:45.257 --> 06:46.980
Anyway, so about this
attatchment?

06:47.025 --> 06:51.041
Yeah. A six months project
starting the life cicle of parasites...

06:51.085 --> 06:52.580
in elephant ***.

06:52.625 --> 06:53.532
Sounds unmissable.

07:02.227 --> 07:06.410
** I caught a glimpse of it on the monitor.

07:08.015 --> 07:10.010
Can you imagine how much
force it took to rip this thing open?

07:10.046 --> 07:12.263
Look at the size of the marks!

07:12.295 --> 07:14.881
You know, if you want my opinion
I think it is...

07:14.915 --> 07:16.862
You don't, do you?

07:16.905 --> 07:19.971
Well, if I found these gauges
in the wild I'd be certainly...

07:20.017 --> 07:21.891
be looking for a large predator.

07:21.935 --> 07:23.703
But we're in the Forest of Dean.

07:23.735 --> 07:28.410
It was huge and it was so fast,
it was gone across the yard in a second.

07:33.147 --> 07:34.440
Look, there's blood.

07:34.486 --> 07:37.883
Stephen...

07:39.387 --> 07:41.551
Come and give me a logic
explanation for this.

07:41.597 --> 07:43.082
It's a hoax, obviously.

07:49.266 --> 07:51.242
Just a... a difficult one to come off.

07:51.286 --> 07:52.923
Can I say something?

07:59.596 --> 08:00.152
Is he alright?

08:00.188 --> 08:04.151
Helen Cutter came to this area
eight years ago to investigate...

08:04.187 --> 08:05.341
a creature site seeing.

08:05.378 --> 08:08.113
She disappeared in the forest, her body was
never found.

08:08.158 --> 08:12.083
Just **, no blood,
***, nothing. She just vanished.

08:27.777 --> 08:29.572
We never expected to a personal call.

08:29.617 --> 08:31.553
All part to your zoo services, Mrs Trent.

08:31.596 --> 08:32.812
It's only a lizard.

08:38.698 --> 08:40.110
I see you like dinosaurs, Ben.

08:40.145 --> 08:42.230
They're awesome.

08:53.856 --> 08:54.550
His name's Rex.

08:54.587 --> 08:56.542
I found him in the forest.

08:56.588 --> 09:00.103
Looked over in a book
and it said it's a flying dragon from southeast Asia.

09:00.138 --> 09:05.333
Draco volans, he's not a draco volans.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.210
No?

09:17.227 --> 09:18.252
In fact, I don't know what he is.

09:18.298 --> 09:20.352
What? I thought you
were an expert.

09:20.388 --> 09:25.210
Well, I am. If I'm right you've discovered
a completely unique species.

09:25.257 --> 09:27.093
Oh, cool!

09:27.137 --> 09:29.980
I need you to show me exactly
where you found him.

09:35.608 --> 09:37.441
Oh, it's too cold for him.

09:37.487 --> 09:40.122
He must have scaped from a private
from a private zoo or something.

09:42.158 --> 09:43.120
I found him around here somewhere.

09:43.165 --> 09:44.280
This way.

09:51.886 --> 09:52.402
Abby!

10:21.897 --> 10:24.042
- Slow down, wait for me.
- Maybe it was a leopard.

10:24.045 --> 10:26.903
They sometimes put their preys up in the
trees and come back for it later.

10:26.935 --> 10:28.063
Don't be silly, Ben.

10:28.098 --> 10:30.002
How many leopards are they in the forest to date?

10:30.048 --> 10:31.033
I don't care.

10:31.067 --> 10:32.431
It's weird, I'm getting out there. 

10:32.468 --> 10:34.273
Ben, hold on.
Wait for me.

10:44.066 --> 10:48.652
...someone as pretty as you, I must admit though,
I've never seen one myself.

10:48.688 --> 10:51.571
Hey, why don't we have
a drink here?

10:54.466 --> 10:55.043
Excuse me.

10:58.107 --> 10:58.702
Don't panic.

10:58.745 --> 11:01.710
Just told that slime ball
over there you were my boyfriend.

11:01.715 --> 11:04.700
One more sleazy pick-up line and I was gonna have to kill him.

11:04.735 --> 11:07.053
Well, I am very glad
I was here to help.

11:07.088 --> 11:08.451
I'm Nick Cutter.

11:08.496 --> 11:09.621
Actually,  I know who you are.

11:11.697 --> 11:13.530
Claudia  Brown, Home Office.

11:13.575 --> 11:15.333
I saw you at the hotel.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.572
I'm hoping you can do
me a favor professor.

11:17.615 --> 11:18.511
Another one?

11:19.978 --> 11:22.940
I suspect this is why
we're both here.

11:22.983 --> 11:26.028
I get dozens of rogue animals
sightings every year.

11:26.066 --> 11:29.331
You'd be doing me a big favour
if you could just confirm this is all nonsense.

11:29.364 --> 11:32.489
I can't dismiss the evidence,
out of hand.

11:32.499 --> 11:36.882
Surely you're not giving this
monster story any credibility.

11:36.916 --> 11:39.831
Just trying to keep an
open mind.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.941
People always say that,
as if that's such a good thing

11:41.985 --> 11:45.251
It really depends how
you define monster.

11:45.287 --> 11:49.250
A wild panther might look
pretty terrifying on a dark night.

11:49.288 --> 11:50.190
Is that what we're dealing with?

11:50.225 --> 11:52.271
My best guess... if it
exists at all.

11:52.306 --> 11:56.252
The last sighting was somewhere
near the forest.

11:56.298 --> 11:59.022
Would you care to join the search?

11:59.025 --> 12:01.320
I suppose I owe it to the tax payers to do more than

12:01.365 --> 12:03.220
sit in in my room
ans suck the mini bar dry.

12:03.226 --> 12:05.901
This database contains constantly updated information
on all extinct vertebraes.

12:08.725 --> 12:11.580
I've been building it every spare second since I was 14.

12:11.616 --> 12:12.573
This is impressive.

12:12.606 --> 12:13.941
It's pretty cool, huh?

12:15.565 --> 12:16.392
And slightly sad.

12:17.407 --> 12:18.992
You know we're not talking
about a wild cat, don't you?

12:19.035 --> 12:21.993
This is Claudia Brown
from the Home Office.

12:22.035 --> 12:23.382
She will be coming with us.

12:23.418 --> 12:24.720
I knew it, it's a cover up?

12:24.758 --> 12:26.141
What is he talking about?

12:26.185 --> 12:28.411
Connor never met a conspiracy theory
he didn't like.

12:37.178 --> 12:38.391
Ben, slow down!

12:41.876 --> 12:42.412
Ben!

13:03.176 --> 13:04.642
Rex!

13:09.847 --> 13:11.300
Come on Rex,
come back.

13:11.345 --> 13:14.422
Ow Rex,
you can listen.

14:03.916 --> 14:04.831
Abby.

14:10.396 --> 14:12.081
Rex, come here!
Stop messing around.

14:49.095 --> 14:51.061
If there really were some creature
around here,

14:51.106 --> 14:52.941
wouldn't journalists
have found it by now?

14:52.988 --> 14:54.513
They wouldn't know
what they were looking for.

14:54.546 --> 14:56.620
But you do.

14:58.007 --> 15:00.633
Since Steven tracked the wounded animals through
the rain forest

15:00.668 --> 15:02.263
for up to 10 days at a time.

15:02.295 --> 15:05.910
Not to mention wrestled an anaconda
and saved the whale.

15:07.525 --> 15:09.070
Maybe there is something here
maybe there isn't.

15:09.116 --> 15:10.283
Frankly I doubt it.

15:10.328 --> 15:11.291
Cutter!

15:20.218 --> 15:21.910
Okay, now I'm getting
interested.

15:25.387 --> 15:28.282
Professor,
the compass is going haywire.

17:24.156 --> 17:29.671
Ben, what on earth is going on in there?

17:30.025 --> 17:32.221
I want this mess tidied up now.

17:37.065 --> 17:39.970
Ok Rex.
Which way now?

18:03.806 --> 18:04.611
Rex!

18:09.338 --> 18:10.173
Don't move.

18:16.337 --> 18:17.992
Is it real?

18:20.297 --> 18:22.841
Some kind of experiment, maybe.

18:22.987 --> 18:25.960
Hybrid, throwback.

18:30.288 --> 18:30.821
Who are you?

18:30.827 --> 18:34.362
Abby Maitland. I'm a keeper at Wellington zoo.

18:40.008 --> 18:43.681
It's a reptile, 5 or 6 tons at least.

18:45.126 --> 18:49.600
Large supertemperal bosses,
huge osteodame on its back.

18:51.027 --> 18:53.143
And it must be some kind of an apsent.

18:58.215 --> 19:00.900
Stay in his field of vision,
you're making him nervous.

19:06.857 --> 19:08.843
I was right, there was a dinosaur
in that warehouse.

19:11.098 --> 19:14.951
Whatever it is, it's classified until
we figure out what the hell to do about it.

19:21.828 --> 19:22.782
Bloody hell.

19:23.915 --> 19:24.822
There's 2 of them?

19:26.765 --> 19:27.643
Where did that come from?

19:30.887 --> 19:33.042
No, I can't use the police,
this is too sensitive.

19:33.087 --> 19:37.230
There are lives at stake here.

19:39.086 --> 19:42.840
Listen, I don't need you to tell
how junior I am. Ok?

19:42.885 --> 19:43.940
You're just gonna have to trust me.

19:45.586 --> 19:47.561
Now get somebody down here fast.

19:52.895 --> 19:54.191
I'll be making a complaint.

19:54.227 --> 19:57.681
She's filled his head with all sorts of
stupid ideas.

19:57.716 --> 20:00.542
But just look at the state
of his room.

20:00.586 --> 20:01.612
It was a dinosaur.

20:01.647 --> 20:04.312
The simple truth is Miss
Maitland got carried away.

20:04.317 --> 20:08.983
Ben's pet was nothing more exotic
than draco volans, flying lizard.

20:09.027 --> 20:10.690
There was a monster though.

20:10.726 --> 20:12.071
It chased us.

20:12.115 --> 20:13.112
Tell 'em Abby.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.503
I don't really know what happened Ben.

20:17.507 --> 20:19.902
We just got frightened, that's all.

20:20.428 --> 20:21.380
But I saw the past!

20:21.427 --> 20:23.680
Prehistoric times.
I was there.

20:23.716 --> 20:24.802
You saw the past?

20:24.837 --> 20:27.291
There was desert and rocks and things.

20:32.596 --> 20:35.262
I blame the telly.
Excuse me.

20:35.306 --> 20:39.031
I know you feel bad
about lying.

20:39.065 --> 20:41.911
But if word of this gets out
who knows what the consequences might be.

20:41.946 --> 20:44.883
You'll both have to sign the official
secret's act.

20:44.927 --> 20:47.311
Since when has this become an
official secret?

20:47.315 --> 20:51.023
About 10 minutes after I finally persuade
my boss not to have me sectioned.

20:51.067 --> 20:53.832
Right now, we have a
far more urgent problem.

20:53.877 --> 20:56.841
That creature we saw may be
many things.

20:56.846 --> 21:01.333
But it's certainly not a ruthless predator
that drags its prey up in trees.

21:01.378 --> 21:02.740
You can't be sure of that.

21:02.787 --> 21:03.572
He can.

21:03.618 --> 21:05.572
It's a herbivor, pure vegy.

21:05.617 --> 21:07.450
You mean there's another one
out there?

21:07.497 --> 21:11.641
What did Ben mean when he
talked about seeing the past?

21:13.628 --> 21:15.612
These animals have to be coming
from somewhere.

21:15.658 --> 21:16.211
What are you saying?

21:16.255 --> 21:18.163
I'm saying...

21:18.206 --> 21:21.110
That the answer is in that forest.

21:21.157 --> 21:23.443
And maybe Ben found it.

21:25.767 --> 21:28.213
You know this is gonna win me
the Nobel prize.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.921
We don't know what we're dealing with yet.

21:30.967 --> 21:37.191
Come on. It looks like a dinosaur
and behaves like a dinosaur, it's a dinosaur.

21:37.227 --> 21:39.471
It's the missing link to the
ancient past.

21:39.506 --> 21:41.653
And I discovered it.

21:41.687 --> 21:42.950
S tephen!

21:46.317 --> 21:47.020
Where is it going? 

21:47.065 --> 21:50.150
Let him go.
Let's scare him.

21:50.195 --> 21:52.543
Let's see where he thinks
it's safe.

22:22.726 --> 22:23.440
Where's it gone?

22:28.655 --> 22:29.463
Home.

22:53.968 --> 22:54.582
My pen!

22:57.217 --> 22:58.490
That explains the compass
going crazy.

22:58.527 --> 23:01.783
What could cause a magnetic
field so powerful?

23:01.825 --> 23:02.941
Maybe it's an alien spaceship.

23:09.085 --> 23:09.810
How  you feeling?

23:09.848 --> 23:15.173
Confused, frightened, exhilarated.

23:15.208 --> 23:16.113
Snap.

23:18.126 --> 23:19.560
You don't think they'll hurt him?

23:19.605 --> 23:21.102
Of course not.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.700
Everything we've seen about the animals
so far is consistent...

23:25.736 --> 23:28.300
with vertebraes that last appeared in the fossil

23:28.305 --> 23:30.993
record hundreds of millions of years ago.

23:31.038 --> 23:32.680
You mean they're like creatures from the past?

23:32.718 --> 23:35.403
No, they are creatures from the past.

23:38.126 --> 23:39.650
Brilliant. It's brilliant.

23:41.055 --> 23:42.562
Oh, that was my front door key.

23:42.565 --> 23:43.892
Cutter, we have to go now.

23:43.937 --> 23:45.063
You got your own
experts.

23:45.096 --> 23:46.722
They didn't see what we saw.

23:46.768 --> 23:48.953
And they don't know what you know.

23:59.508 --> 24:01.110
You're thinking about Helen.
Aren't you?

24:03.228 --> 24:04.232
It explains everything.

24:04.277 --> 24:05.971
Except why she didn't come back.

24:33.368 --> 24:34.642
Claudia Brown, Home Office.

24:34.657 --> 24:36.630
Yes, I've seen your file.

24:37.527 --> 24:40.812
James Lester. I'll be in charge of coordinating
our response.

24:42.186 --> 24:43.113
You shouldn't have brought them here.

24:43.116 --> 24:44.193
They have no security clearence.

24:44.196 --> 24:46.311
I don't like civilians in
these situations.

24:46.317 --> 24:48.601
How many situations like
this have you had?

24:48.637 --> 24:51.463
How do we know they're not responsible
for this in someway?

24:51.508 --> 24:52.542
That's not possible.

24:52.588 --> 24:56.443
You spend your entire career
planning for just about every crisis imaginable

24:56.475 --> 24:59.801
up to and including alien invasion.
Then this happens.

24:59.835 --> 25:03.653
So much for thinking
outside the bloody box?

25:11.207 --> 25:13.890
Something large has been through here.
Recently.

25:13.936 --> 25:18.410
I'm not hm.. really outdoorsy.

25:18.455 --> 25:21.410
I got sinus issues and allergies.

25:21.457 --> 25:22.931
I'll write you a list.

25:25.486 --> 25:27.311
We can't rely on the army
to find this creature.

25:27.347 --> 25:28.801
So just keep looking.

25:31.038 --> 25:32.312
It's so close I can sense it.

25:36.388 --> 25:37.593
Shouldn't we just wait for
the professor?

25:39.295 --> 25:41.401
This phenomenon, professor,

25:41.445 --> 25:43.980
Claudia tells me you have an explanation.

25:44.017 --> 25:45.003
A theory.

25:46.418 --> 25:49.460
Boyd's experience proves that
there's a concrete landscape...

25:49.498 --> 25:51.152
on the other side of the
anomaly.

25:51.196 --> 25:55.800
And I think it's the earth many
millions of years ago.

25:55.845 --> 26:00.300
And this anomaly, as you call it,
is a door between

26:00.307 --> 26:03.443
time zones in the world's history?

26:03.875 --> 26:06.303
Let's suppose this remarkable theory is correct,

26:06.306 --> 26:07.320
What are the immediate risks?

26:07.357 --> 26:11.801
Famine, war, pestilence, the ends of the world
as we know it, the usual stuff.

26:11.837 --> 26:13.151
I think I can do without the facetiousness.

26:13.188 --> 26:16.343
I can't do without standing in some
anemic office ***

26:16.346 --> 26:19.540
talking to a civil servant pen pusher

26:19.585 --> 26:21.991
when I should be exploring the most

26:21.995 --> 26:24.423
significant phenomenom in the history of science.

26:24.456 --> 26:27.403
Technically I'm not actually
a civil servant.

26:27.445 --> 26:32.741
More a troubleshots** without
portfolio in the PM's office.

26:32.775 --> 26:34.452
You mean you're a goverment
hatcherman.

26:34.488 --> 26:37.272
Colorful, but a surprisingly accurate.

26:37.308 --> 26:38.980
And there's something else
you should know.

26:39.028 --> 26:40.991
I intent to find out what

26:40.995 --> 26:42.993
happened to my wife whatever the risks.

26:43.036 --> 26:46.810
So I'm going through the anomaly
and if you want to stop me

26:46.846 --> 26:49.063
then you'll gonna have to shoot me.

26:54.308 --> 26:55.421
I hope it won't come to that.

26:58.266 --> 26:58.851
So...

27:00.465 --> 27:01.283
What do you think of Abby?

27:02.856 --> 27:03.473
She's ok. Why?

27:04.576 --> 27:06.282
I was picking up some heat
between us.

27:07.756 --> 27:09.193
You get an instinct for these
kinds of things.

27:09.227 --> 27:11.071
I thought you already
had a girlfriend.

27:12.538 --> 27:15.840
She's more of a... penpal really.

27:15.887 --> 27:17.520
She lives in the Gambia.

27:17.565 --> 27:20.072
It's practical for a night out.

27:20.118 --> 27:21.310
Yeah.

27:22.276 --> 27:23.221
Do you think Abby likes me?

27:23.266 --> 27:25.300
Why don't you ask her yourself?

27:25.338 --> 27:28.670
Alright, I might.

27:28.717 --> 27:30.343
It's not everyday you meet
a potential girlfriend.

27:33.867 --> 27:34.940
And find a dinosaur.

27:40.125 --> 27:40.833
Stephen? 

27:43.098 --> 27:44.061
Stephen?

27:49.386 --> 27:51.163
You really shouldn't handle a
lizard like that.

27:51.205 --> 27:52.831
Let the experts do their job.

27:52.867 --> 27:54.373
They don't know what
they're doing.

28:02.005 --> 28:03.441
Your really shouldn't mess
with an angry lizard.

28:03.488 --> 28:04.990
I'm terrified.

28:07.368 --> 28:08.332
Do they even know he can fly?

28:11.535 --> 28:12.572
F ly?

28:15.898 --> 28:16.462
Grab it!

28:17.628 --> 28:18.393
Watch the door!

28:28.638 --> 28:29.430
Rex!

28:35.396 --> 28:37.010
- He can fly.
- Hmm, pretty well.

28:50.408 --> 28:51.153
He's going up.

29:01.978 --> 29:03.481
I think we have to take a view...

29:16.056 --> 29:16.613
Rex!

29:20.808 --> 29:21.893
Don't do it, Rex.

29:21.936 --> 29:24.391
It's not your world out
there anymore.

29:28.238 --> 29:29.072
Try some of this.

29:30.216 --> 29:30.630
You'll love it.

29:32.985 --> 29:33.750
I promise.

29:41.257 --> 29:42.142
Rex, come back!

29:50.467 --> 29:51.513
***

29:56.148 --> 29:57.230
Good decision, Rex.

30:01.488 --> 30:04.863
Those risks you were talking about,
there's one I didn't tell you about

30:04.898 --> 30:06.403
running down your back.

30:15.475 --> 30:16.772
It's so perfect.

30:31.028 --> 30:31.782
What's this?

30:34.346 --> 30:37.872
I think the scientific terms
is really bad news.

30:40.405 --> 30:41.992
The lizard's DNA confirms your theory.

30:42.037 --> 30:44.253
The creature's a living fossil.

30:44.286 --> 30:46.182
Under the circumstances
I'm going to allow your

30:46.285 --> 30:48.082
exploratory mission into the anomaly

30:48.115 --> 30:50.642
I'm taking the lizard back.

30:50.677 --> 30:54.352
Creatures that don't belong here
should be returned to their natural habitat.

30:59.897 --> 31:03.850
It's a disclaimer.
We don't want any nasty lawsuits if you don't come back.

31:07.326 --> 31:11.230
Ok, my best guess?
The creature we found is some kind of scutossauro.

31:11.265 --> 31:12.561
Like permian era.

31:12.595 --> 31:15.230
That footprint, definitely not the same animal

31:15.265 --> 31:18.450
If we are talking permian then
this

31:18.458 --> 31:21.741
little charmer is the prime suspect.

31:21.778 --> 31:23.541
It's a gorgonopsid.

31:24.867 --> 31:27.502
It's a compact killing machine
and it's got incredible power, Steven.

31:27.546 --> 31:29.602
If it's still out there,
then you have to find it.

31:30.838 --> 31:31.430
Fast.

31:33.826 --> 31:34.430
What about you?

31:34.475 --> 31:40.891
You are the hunter, me I'm more
logistics and you know backup.

32:27.735 --> 32:30.981
Sooner you finish your detention, Ben,
sooner we can both go home.

32:34.375 --> 32:35.733
Miss!

32:36.286 --> 32:37.942
Miss, there's a dinosaur in the playground..

32:40.227 --> 32:42.421
Really Ben, how old are you now?

33:00.166 --> 33:00.930
Now we gotta get out.

33:00.966 --> 33:03.213
Ben, sit down now.

33:03.247 --> 33:04.281
There's a dinosaur.

33:06.448 --> 33:07.012
Miss, come on.

33:14.107 --> 33:15.101
Don't open the door.

33:16.356 --> 33:17.750
Don't open it!

33:43.358 --> 33:44.892
Pick on someone on your own size.

34:53.405 --> 34:55.181
- You called Steven again?
- He's not answering.

34:55.188 --> 35:00.551
It's 18.15, I want you back no late
than 2000 hours.

35:00.555 --> 35:02.310
If the first contact works out, we'll take it from there.

35:02.317 --> 35:04.592
What's he doing here?

35:04.605 --> 35:07.001
This is captain Ryan, he's a Gulf war veteran

35:07.007 --> 35:09.413
with extensive desert experience.

35:09.427 --> 35:12.160
We don't know how dangerous
it'll be on the other side of the anomaly.

35:12.168 --> 35:14.800
No argument, Cutter.

35:14.815 --> 35:16.302
He goes as well.

35:22.026 --> 35:24.890
Please take care of him.

35:25.277 --> 35:27.343
Look out for yourself too.

35:27.376 --> 35:28.900
Yeah, we'll be fine.

35:30.485 --> 35:35.523
Whatever happens, bring him back.

36:36.877 --> 36:37.990
My pen.

36:39.808 --> 36:41.613
The magnetic field didn't take it.

36:42.615 --> 36:44.791
You know, this is getting weaker.

36:57.587 --> 36:59.693
Give me an hour.
Give me one hour alone.

37:01.567 --> 37:02.471
I've got a radio.

37:25.795 --> 37:27.611
Helen!

37:45.017 --> 37:45.753
Professor!

37:47.988 --> 37:49.402
Professor! Over here!

38:05.207 --> 38:05.831
My God.

38:17.875 --> 38:19.733
People, somebody's been here before us.

38:19.768 --> 38:22.781
Whatever it was it didn't get far. Over here.

38:51.878 --> 38:53.350
H.C. It's Hellen Cutter.

39:03.078 --> 39:03.770
Is that her?

39:10.415 --> 39:11.912
No, it's a man.

39:11.958 --> 39:13.032
How did he die?

39:13.075 --> 39:15.340
I don't know.

39:17.217 --> 39:18.541
It's time to go.

39:18.548 --> 39:22.242
Well, I can't help there, i've got to find me wife.

39:23.928 --> 39:25.252
We have to go.

39:25.268 --> 39:26.400
I'm staying.

39:31.856 --> 39:33.433
Sorry professor.

40:12.745 --> 40:14.880
Don't do that again.

40:16.126 --> 40:18.122
The anomaly is disappearing.

40:20.205 --> 40:24.331
Quick! Do you wanna be trapped here forever?

40:25.288 --> 40:27.223
I'm staying here to look for my wife.

40:27.267 --> 40:28.653
I'm not leaving you behind.

40:28.688 --> 40:31.111
What are you gonna do? Shoot me?

40:33.696 --> 40:35.662
Ok, if you stay I'll stay.

40:35.698 --> 40:37.663
That's just childish.

40:47.947 --> 40:48.610
Alright.

40:55.815 --> 40:56.640
Look!

40:58.076 --> 40:59.000
Cutter?

40:59.006 --> 41:00.000
Get back.

41:11.318 --> 41:12.791
Whad did you see?

41:15.347 --> 41:16.493
You're not gonna believe it.

41:18.038 --> 41:18.660
What was it like?

41:25.568 --> 41:27.592
- You get him up.
- God, you oughta see it.

41:30.418 --> 41:30.812
Oh my God!

41:31.795 --> 41:32.462
Run!

41:55.217 --> 41:56.020
Cutter!
Claudia!

41:58.906 --> 41:59.301
Quick!

42:25.906 --> 42:30.951
Steven! Catch!

42:51.315 --> 42:53.511
We developed the film in the camera you brought back

42:55.975 --> 42:57.033
It's her, it's Helen.

43:08.007 --> 43:10.121
I'm sorry for your personal loss, professor.

43:11.607 --> 43:13.571
This camp that you discovered,

43:13.577 --> 43:15.573
there were no clues to
who made it or what it was for?

43:16.928 --> 43:19.570
The thought that someone's been there before us is far from
reassuring.

43:20.635 --> 43:23.601
and I used to think that EU common agricultural policy was far
farfetched.

43:23.637 --> 43:27.261
Still, at least the immediate crisis is over.

43:27.306 --> 43:34.883
Some force out there ripped the boundaries of space and times to shreds.

43:34.915 --> 43:37.801
Maybe its happen before in wich case

43:37.808 --> 43:40.681
every single thing we thought we knew about the universe is wrong.

43:40.727 --> 43:45.883
Or this is the first time in which case, what changed? What happens next?

43:45.926 --> 43:48.143
Believe it's very very far from over.

44:45.515 --> 44:46.291
Hello?

45:10.797 --> 45:11.391
Helen!

45:13.508 --> 45:14.490
Helen!

45:15.508 --> 45:17.490
