00:02.160 --> 00:04.759
Luther. Is he really as dirty as they say?

00:04.880 --> 00:07.079
What, all the people
who've never worked with him?

00:07.200 --> 00:09.399
Did you ever hear of necro-porn?

00:09.520 --> 00:11.999
This is what they're going to do
to Jenny. You owe me.

00:13.200 --> 00:15.559
- I am arresting you...
- Get off me!

00:15.680 --> 00:19.439
If he doesn't keep on doing
what they tell him, they'll hurt me.

00:21.040 --> 00:24.079
I gather you're the policeman
that stole my property.

00:26.040 --> 00:27.879
This is Toby.

00:29.040 --> 00:31.519
No! No! Agh!

00:31.640 --> 00:33.199
Where am I supposed to go?

00:35.000 --> 00:41.074

00:56.600 --> 01:00.239
Pump number two, that's £64. 19, please.

01:00.360 --> 01:03.079
- Can I interest you in one...?
- Just the petrol, ta.

01:32.480 --> 01:34.199
What's he doing?

01:42.440 --> 01:45.159
He's on something. Look at him.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.039
You might want to give
the police a call, mate.

01:49.160 --> 01:50.599
What's he doing exactly?

01:50.720 --> 01:51.999
Dunno.

01:56.240 --> 02:00.599
Look, just dial 999.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.559
And say what?
"Hello, I'm calling from a petrol station,

02:04.680 --> 02:07.239
"there's a man on the forecourt
looking at cars"?

02:07.360 --> 02:08.598
Just do it, mate.

02:08.720 --> 02:09.878
What's he doing?

02:13.840 --> 02:15.879
- That's my car! Hey! Oi!
- Police, please.

02:18.920 --> 02:23.119
- They're on their way. Five minutes.
- What's he on, do you think?

02:24.720 --> 02:27.879
Excuse me, did we lock the door?
Because I think we should lock the door!

02:28.000 --> 02:28.999
That's a very good idea.

02:51.680 --> 02:53.199
- Hey!
- Lock the door! Hurry up! Lock the door!

02:53.320 --> 02:54.239
I'm trying!

02:54.360 --> 02:57.879
- Let me out! Hey! Hey! That's my car!
- The police will be here in a minute!

02:58.000 --> 03:01.479
But look at my car! Look at my car!

03:08.320 --> 03:11.199
- Unlock this door!
- The police will be here in a minute.

03:11.320 --> 03:12.279
But look at my car!

03:12.400 --> 03:14.919
Oh, no, mate.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.279
- Is he opening...?
- I'm not letting him do that.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.359
- I'm not.
- No, wait! Nobody leaves.

03:19.480 --> 03:20.399
He's going to torch the car.

03:20.520 --> 03:22.599
- Just wait for the police.
- He's going to torch the car!

03:22.720 --> 03:25.719
Right, open the door. Just do as he says
and open the bloody door!

03:25.840 --> 03:28.199
- Be careful.
- Oi! Hey! Hey! You stop!

03:28.320 --> 03:33.759
Ah! Agh! Christ! My eyes!

03:33.880 --> 03:37.759
- Put down the bat. Put down the bat.
- Argh!

03:38.800 --> 03:40.279
Fire bucket! Fire bucket!

03:49.920 --> 03:52.279
Have you locked the door? Quick! Quick!

03:54.240 --> 03:55.879
Take the keys. Lock it.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.559
- Brace it! Brace it!
- I'm trying!

♪ Love is like a sin, my love

05:23.280 --> 05:29.479
♪ For the ones that feel it the most

05:29.600 --> 05:35.079
♪ Look at her with her eyes like a flame

05:36.760 --> 05:42.639
♪ She will love you

06:04.520 --> 06:06.199
Wakey, wakey!

06:07.560 --> 06:09.799
Come on, wake up. The day's half over.

06:09.920 --> 06:11.519
But it's nothing o'clock.

06:11.640 --> 06:12.999
Are you hungry?

06:31.960 --> 06:33.839
Do you like reading books?

06:33.960 --> 06:35.799
I'm partial to a graphic novel.

06:35.920 --> 06:38.039
Comics? How old are you?

06:38.160 --> 06:41.039
Graphic novels. How old are you?

06:48.320 --> 06:50.079
You look normal.

06:51.720 --> 06:52.719
Ta.

06:53.920 --> 06:55.559
You look weird when you look normal.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.639
You think I sleep in a tie?

06:57.760 --> 06:59.319
Hmm, pretty much.

06:59.440 --> 07:01.679
Except you don't so much sleep
as, you know,

07:01.800 --> 07:04.599
power down, go into stand-by mode.

07:05.640 --> 07:07.319
Yeah, well...

07:07.440 --> 07:09.279
I took the day off.

07:10.240 --> 07:12.039
Why?

07:12.160 --> 07:15.959
Cos we've got to think
about getting you...a job.

07:21.320 --> 07:22.719
What sort of job?

07:22.840 --> 07:25.679
- A job job.
- Like flipping burgers?

07:25.800 --> 07:28.719
Well, them burgers are not going
to flip themselves, are they?

07:30.120 --> 07:32.719
It's, like, 2p an hour.
Who am I, SpongeBob?

07:32.840 --> 07:36.599
- I don't know what that is.
- He's a sponge. He flips burgers.

07:36.720 --> 07:40.799
Right. Well, why don't we keep
flipping burgers to plan B?

07:42.440 --> 07:44.519
If you could do any job in the world,
what would you do?

07:44.640 --> 07:47.599
- I'd be a cool hunter.
- A what?

07:47.720 --> 07:51.759
Cool hunter. Go to seriously
sick places, clubs, whatever.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.399
Underground, not mainstream.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.959
You kind of take note of what people
are wearing, what slang they're using,

07:56.080 --> 07:58.559
what they're drinking, that sort of thing.

08:01.520 --> 08:04.199
It's a lot more complicated
than it sounds.

08:09.560 --> 08:11.559
Cup of tea.

08:18.840 --> 08:21.159
Totally lushalicious.

08:25.480 --> 08:27.439
So...

08:27.560 --> 08:29.519
what are you going to do
about the other thing?

08:29.640 --> 08:31.039
Being on the hook and that?

08:32.400 --> 08:34.399
Is that what I am? On the hook?

08:35.799 --> 08:36.919
Well, yeah.

08:38.039 --> 08:40.479
Toby won't just let us go, you know.

08:43.280 --> 08:44.479
I'll think of something.

09:06.000 --> 09:06.959
Morning.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.519
- All right?
- Your phone was off.

09:08.640 --> 09:11.279
Right. Well, keep the phone on,
all it does is ring.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.879
Yeah. Sorry. The boss sent me.
We've got a really weird one.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.319
Um, OK. All right, um, just wait
in the car and I'll get changed.

09:18.440 --> 09:20.279
- Why wait in the car?
- Two minutes.

09:20.400 --> 09:21.799
Two minutes.

09:26.240 --> 09:27.559
I've got to go to work.

09:29.640 --> 09:35.359
So, you, whatever you do today,
make sure you hit the Jobcentre, right?

09:35.480 --> 09:36.679
Hand.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.479
- What?
- Hand, please.

09:45.640 --> 09:47.519
Completely bomb dot com.

09:47.640 --> 09:51.839
Now, you want to keep it clean and dry
and clear of infection.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.599
All right, Mum.

09:58.280 --> 10:03.399
So the stolen car belonged
to the dead man, Adewale Omotoso.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.479
Jesus.

10:17.320 --> 10:19.799
White van belongs to a Steven Kimble.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.559
- Is that the man that was blinded?
- Yeah, that's him.

10:22.680 --> 10:25.479
Acid in a water pistol.
Probably hydrochloric.

10:26.960 --> 10:27.999
Witnesses?

10:28.120 --> 10:31.319
Sally Thomas and Depak Chandrapal,
who locked themselves inside the shop.

10:31.440 --> 10:33.319
Thing is, both claim that they reckon

10:33.440 --> 10:37.199
the attacker intended to ram the window
but changed his mind last minute

10:37.320 --> 10:38.839
- and drove away.
- We know why?

10:38.960 --> 10:41.159
Dunno. Uniform were dealing
with an altercation outside a pub

10:41.280 --> 10:43.999
called the Prince Regent,
which is about half a mile up there.

10:44.120 --> 10:45.799
So they were Johnny-on-the-spot.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.679
They were here two minutes
after the 999 call came in,

10:48.800 --> 10:53.319
so maybe he's heard the sirens
and, you know, just ran away.

10:53.440 --> 10:54.839
Maybe.

10:55.920 --> 11:00.199
So, er, timeline. He gets here.
What's the first thing he does?

11:00.320 --> 11:02.399
Graffities the Corolla.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.599
- Corolla? Where?
- On the roof.

11:04.720 --> 11:06.199
- Have you done here, SOCO?
- Yeah.

11:12.400 --> 11:13.319
A compass, maybe?

11:13.440 --> 11:17.439
Run it by intel,
see if there's any gang association.

11:17.560 --> 11:18.999
I was thinking - four people,

11:19.120 --> 11:24.039
two black, including the dead man,
one white, one Asian.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.999
You think it was racial?

11:26.120 --> 11:28.639
Well, Nazis do love an insignia.

11:28.760 --> 11:30.519
But Kimble's white.

11:30.640 --> 11:32.439
He got in the way.

11:33.720 --> 11:35.359
Yeah. Well, look into it.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.279
See if there's any, er...

11:37.400 --> 11:42.199
white-power faction...
affiliated with that.

11:48.640 --> 11:49.639
Hold it there.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.759
What's he doing?

11:54.760 --> 11:58.559
- Is he tying a shoelace or something?
- Could be. Or reading a text?

11:58.680 --> 12:00.359
What, kneeling down?

12:00.480 --> 12:01.959
Is that a thing?

12:02.080 --> 12:05.439
Could be getting something
out of his sock?

12:05.560 --> 12:08.079
- What could Benny do with that?
- Probably not much.

12:08.200 --> 12:11.599
- Resolution's pretty low.
- Let me see the rest.

12:19.520 --> 12:21.799
I tell you what,
if they hadn't have stopped him,

12:21.920 --> 12:24.439
he would have blown
this whole place to the moon.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.279
Hang on, they've found the car.

12:35.360 --> 12:36.759
All right...

12:36.880 --> 12:39.519
- what've we got?
- Not much.

12:39.640 --> 12:42.919
He's torched it, obviously, and that's it.

12:43.040 --> 12:46.479
Listen, this is taken from CCTV
at the garage. Get on to uniform,

12:46.600 --> 12:47.999
get them to canvass the area, see if

12:48.120 --> 12:50.359
- we can't put a name to that face.
- Right, will do.

12:54.320 --> 12:58.399
- Is everything all right, guv?
- Er...yeah. Yeah.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.079
So you handle door-to-door.

13:00.200 --> 13:04.359
Justin...get on to intel,
see if they can ID that compass.

13:04.480 --> 13:07.159
I'll meet you at the factory, all right?
I've got a meeting.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.559
- You all right?
- Yeah, great.

13:12.440 --> 13:14.359
It's just...you know.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.479
Just what?

13:17.600 --> 13:18.839
I just...

13:20.040 --> 13:22.199
...want to do it right, you know?

13:22.320 --> 13:24.879
Listen, if he asks you to do something
and you're not sure,

13:25.000 --> 13:29.319
don't butt heads with him. OK?
Just, well, come and see me.

13:31.680 --> 13:37.159
Right. Better get canvassing.
Nazis, nutters, jugglers and the clowns.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.519
I like this bit. Watch.

13:58.800 --> 14:01.319
- All right, show's over!
- Wait for it...

14:01.440 --> 14:03.599
There!

14:03.720 --> 14:05.199
I am arresting you...

14:05.320 --> 14:06.839
It's brilliant!

14:08.600 --> 14:11.119
Oh, and it never gets old. Honestly.

14:11.240 --> 14:13.519
Yeah, and I hear that, um...

14:13.640 --> 14:15.919
she's living with you now.

14:17.680 --> 14:19.319
How is... How's that working out?

14:19.440 --> 14:21.159
Let's not talk about Jenny, eh?

14:21.280 --> 14:25.919
Good for you. You can't beat
a nice warm mouth to come home to.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.439
She did live with another man for a while.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.639
And he was a depraved
old monster, really.

14:32.680 --> 14:34.559
I think she liked it, in a way.

14:34.680 --> 14:37.719
Being his dirty little servant.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.279
Daddy issues.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.799
- Do you know why she left him?
- Thing is, I don't care.

14:42.920 --> 14:45.999
He asked how much it would cost
to buy her outright,

14:46.120 --> 14:49.839
thereafter to do as his will dictated,
one presumes.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.879
I've still got his number somewhere.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.319
Michael Saroyan. Armenian imports.

15:01.440 --> 15:04.239
Making aggressive moves
in the local market.

15:04.360 --> 15:07.119
He's merging smaller operations -

15:07.240 --> 15:10.439
clubs, trafficking, girls, protection,
all the rest of it.

15:10.560 --> 15:12.999
Another job for you -

15:13.120 --> 15:14.919
I'd like to know the extent
of his market penetration.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.639
Your turf wars are your business.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.359
If that sort of thing ever got traced back

15:18.480 --> 15:20.039
- to me...
- Make sure it's not.

15:20.160 --> 15:23.079
A list of his capital assets.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.679
I'd tread carefully
with that sort of thing.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.759
No, you'll tread exactly
where and how I tell you.

15:28.880 --> 15:34.799
A list of Saroyan's personnel today.
Are we clear?

15:34.920 --> 15:37.919
What, do I have to ask more politely?

15:39.480 --> 15:41.999
I'm sick of this. Just do as you're told.

15:47.560 --> 15:48.679
John.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.999
I need what I asked for...today.

16:00.680 --> 16:02.999
Or we'll pop round, pay Jenny a visit.

16:04.720 --> 16:06.439
Yeah, open her up. See what's inside.

16:15.440 --> 16:17.399
Look at yourself, Frank.

16:31.760 --> 16:33.479
- What?
- You know what.

16:33.600 --> 16:35.639
No, I don't know what. What?
Tell me what.

16:36.720 --> 16:39.639
You don't think I can do it, do you?
You actually don't think I'm capable

16:39.760 --> 16:42.199
of squeezing a couple of addresses
out of a dirty copper.

16:42.320 --> 16:43.879
He's not a dirty copper.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.839
He's a man over a barrel.

16:46.960 --> 16:51.639
That's a completely different thing, and
you handle it a completely different way.

18:40.760 --> 18:42.519
What have we got, Gray?

18:42.640 --> 18:45.839
Um, there are one or two
white-power psychos in the estate,

18:45.960 --> 18:48.159
namely one Ryan Hayfield.

18:48.280 --> 18:49.559
And do we like him?

18:49.680 --> 18:52.479
Well, he's unemployed,
long history of mental illness,

18:52.600 --> 18:54.879
interest in various
right-of-right-wing groups.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.679
Lives with his mum, always a good sign
in a man of 35. And that's him.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.319
Nah. Definitely not.

19:01.480 --> 19:03.639
Eliminate him. What have you got?

19:03.760 --> 19:06.679
I checked the compass design
against local gang insignia -

19:06.800 --> 19:10.599
A-Road, Mothers' Square Boys,
Gravehouse Boys, Hindle Street Gangs...

19:10.720 --> 19:13.439
- Any joy?
- Completely joyless.

19:13.560 --> 19:17.479
Yeah. It never felt like tagging to me.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.639
Why put it on a roof,

19:19.760 --> 19:21.919
- where no-one can see it?
- I don't think it's a compass.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.039
Oh, yeah?

19:23.160 --> 19:26.079
See, in my spare time,
I like to read a lot of fantasy fiction.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.999
And I think it's the Bedlam Axis.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.319
What's a Bedlam Axis when it's at home?

19:31.440 --> 19:34.479
Yeah. Bedlam Axis has been around
since the 1960s.

19:34.600 --> 19:37.919
It's used a lot in RPG -
role-playing games.

19:38.040 --> 19:42.039
So, the arrow going upwards indicates
predictability, law and order.

19:42.160 --> 19:45.599
The arrow going across
indicates unpredictably.

19:45.720 --> 19:47.039
Chaos.

19:48.800 --> 19:52.319
Can we see that CCTV footage
of him kneeling down?

19:54.320 --> 19:55.679
Yeah, I...

19:56.760 --> 19:58.959
I don't think he's tying up his shoelace.

20:00.120 --> 20:02.599
You know, I tie my shoelace like this.

20:05.240 --> 20:07.199
I don't think he's texting either.

20:14.360 --> 20:17.279
I think he's making his decisions
on a roll of a dice.

20:17.400 --> 20:20.479
Who to kill, when to kill,
whether or not to kill.

20:20.600 --> 20:25.359
Have you come across
anything like this ever before?

20:25.480 --> 20:26.919
No. You?

20:27.040 --> 20:28.479
No.

20:28.600 --> 20:31.919
Judging by his demeanour last night,
the man was enjoying himself immensely.

20:32.040 --> 20:35.399
So what are the chances
of there being more to come?

20:35.520 --> 20:38.799
Think of this as a spree
that's only just started.

20:39.840 --> 20:44.279
Yeah, well, that may be true,
but one crime does not a pattern make.

20:44.400 --> 20:48.519
We don't know which aspects of it
he may choose to repeat.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.319
If any.

20:50.440 --> 20:53.479
I mean, if he's doing all this
at the roll of a dice,

20:53.600 --> 20:55.919
his next kill could be any time,
anywhere, any place.

20:55.920 --> 20:56.799
His next kill could be any time,
anywhere, any place.

20:58.360 --> 21:02.119
- So, how do we catch him?
- Well, we get lucky.

21:02.240 --> 21:04.559
Or he gets unlucky.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.279
Or a combination of the two.

21:22.600 --> 21:25.439
Listen to me, Toby. Yeah. Listen, listen.

21:25.560 --> 21:27.879
I know you want to be a big boy
and impress Frank, all right,

21:28.000 --> 21:31.559
but you need to calm down.
You'll get it when I get it.

21:31.680 --> 21:33.719
- No, no. Today.
- I can't.

21:33.840 --> 21:35.599
Yes. Yes, you can. You'll do it now.

21:35.720 --> 21:38.759
Listen, if that stuff isn't in my hands
in the next two hours,

21:38.880 --> 21:40.679
do I have to tell you what'll happen?

21:40.800 --> 21:43.439
Unless you want me
to dismember your whore.

21:45.280 --> 21:46.799
So just do as you're told.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.199
- Who's fire picket?
- Guv, that's me.

22:27.320 --> 22:29.839
- Well, clear the floor, then, please.
- OK, everyone.

22:29.960 --> 22:35.039
You know the drill. Let's
all meet at the assembly point, please!

22:35.160 --> 22:37.199
Sorry, sorry, sorry!
Quick as you can.

22:45.160 --> 22:48.159
Hello?

23:23.080 --> 23:25.479
Password...?

25:44.520 --> 25:46.039
All right?

25:46.160 --> 25:50.959
OK, everyone. We need to do
a quick head count. Sorry about this.

25:51.080 --> 25:52.919
Right, let's go.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.319
Tossers.

28:05.080 --> 28:07.479
Yo, John Luther, it's me.

28:07.600 --> 28:13.199
So I went to the Jobcentre, and they
weren't amazingly pleasant to me.

28:15.160 --> 28:18.719
Turns out there's been
this global downturn, whatever.

28:20.320 --> 28:23.359
So it's...all quiet on the job front.

28:57.920 --> 28:59.439
Hello, Mum?

29:02.320 --> 29:04.759
You fancy meeting up
for coffee or something?

29:18.160 --> 29:19.519
Right, it's our man.

29:20.880 --> 29:24.079
Definitely our man.
We just don't know who he is,

29:24.200 --> 29:26.439
and we can't tell
what he's going to do next, so...

29:26.560 --> 29:29.559
- We've got to know where he's at.
- How do we do that?

29:30.560 --> 29:34.199
I say we get CO19 ready,
monitor the emergency lines.

29:34.320 --> 29:36.559
If we hear anything that sounds unusual,
we think it's him,

29:36.680 --> 29:39.399
we send in armed response.

29:39.520 --> 29:41.599
See if we can't catch him in the act.

29:41.720 --> 29:45.079
London's got, what,
six thousand 999 calls a day?

29:45.200 --> 29:48.319
Yeah, but 70% of them
are time-wasters, cats up trees.

29:48.440 --> 29:50.239
Most of the rest is meat and potatoes.
It shouldn't be

29:50.360 --> 29:52.839
- too hard to set up a filter.
- Right.

29:53.880 --> 29:56.279
If we think it's him,
we make a judgment call.

29:56.400 --> 29:57.999
We go in loud and heavy.

29:59.160 --> 30:00.519
What do you think of that plan?

30:01.640 --> 30:03.079
- Let's do it.
- Sounds good.

30:12.720 --> 30:14.999
- Police emergency.
- ...threatening to kill herself...

30:15.120 --> 30:17.839
Covered in blood.
I don't know what to do...

30:17.960 --> 30:20.519
...just running around
with blood all over his face...

30:20.640 --> 30:24.359
- I dunno, a knife or something.
- My son, he's schizophrenic.

30:24.480 --> 30:26.159
He's off his medication...

30:26.280 --> 30:30.119
Oh, yeah, I'm not being funny, but there's
this really mean dog running around.

30:30.240 --> 30:31.319
I know it sounds a bit...

30:31.440 --> 30:33.799
But I'm just worried
it's going to bite a baby or something.

30:56.480 --> 30:59.199
A woman's just been mugged.
Yeah. An old lady.

30:59.320 --> 31:02.319
Two blokes came up to her and just, bang,
they just ran off with her bag.

31:13.440 --> 31:15.999
An inmate. I'm all covered in blood.
I don't know what to do.

32:11.040 --> 32:14.679
Sir. OK, boys and girls,
we've got ourselves a weird one.

32:14.800 --> 32:15.799
Here we go.

32:15.920 --> 32:18.599
- Benny, what you got for me?
- Random attack. Three people stabbed.

32:18.720 --> 32:20.879
Killer has stolen
a motorcycle courier's bike,

32:21.000 --> 32:22.559
bag, helmet and jacket.

32:22.680 --> 32:26.759
He left the scene three minutes ago
on the bike, dressed as a courier.

32:26.880 --> 32:31.199
All right. Here's the plan.
Contact that courier's delivery company,

32:31.320 --> 32:34.319
find out what his next scheduled
delivery is, scramble ARV,

32:34.440 --> 32:35.679
see if we can't get there before he does.

32:35.800 --> 32:37.519
That's him. That's him.

34:45.080 --> 34:47.719
Susie! Susie! Come on!

35:50.280 --> 35:52.959
- How many?
- Four confirmed dead.

35:53.080 --> 35:54.879
Many injured.

35:56.080 --> 35:57.959
We missed him by...minutes.

35:58.080 --> 36:00.999
We don't have him and we don't know
where he's going to go next.

36:01.120 --> 36:04.159
He'd have dumped
the courier rig and moved on.

36:05.960 --> 36:07.079
Escape route?

36:07.200 --> 36:09.159
Through the car park.

37:19.560 --> 37:20.599
Boss, what's up?

37:20.720 --> 37:22.079
Justin, he's still in the building!

37:22.200 --> 37:24.039
Dressed as an employee.

37:24.960 --> 37:26.679
OK. Erin.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.559
He's still here.
Make sure no-one else leaves.

37:30.680 --> 37:31.799
OK.

38:52.760 --> 38:53.879
Put the phone down.

39:18.360 --> 39:20.759
This is John Luther. Leave a message.

39:25.160 --> 39:28.319
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on, come on...

40:08.560 --> 40:10.119
All right, Mum?

40:19.080 --> 40:20.319
All right, Mum?

40:21.360 --> 40:23.359
Coffee shop closed?

40:23.480 --> 40:25.399
So are you sleeping with him?

40:27.880 --> 40:29.919
"Hello, Jen! How are you?

40:30.040 --> 40:32.599
"Can I tell you, you look utterly mint?"

40:32.720 --> 40:36.639
- Are you?
- Utterly mint? Totally.

40:36.760 --> 40:38.559
Sleeping with him?

40:38.680 --> 40:40.839
Whatever. He's, like, 55.

40:43.120 --> 40:45.079
So how are you paying the rent?

40:46.480 --> 40:48.079
He doesn't want rent, actually.

40:48.200 --> 40:50.279
I bet he doesn't.

40:55.640 --> 40:58.079
If you knew how that man
tortured your dad.

41:01.800 --> 41:04.799
- Because you loved Dad so much, right?!
- Yes.

41:04.920 --> 41:06.559
I did.

41:09.760 --> 41:14.919
So you didn't try to screw John
the minute Dad was cold in the ground?

41:16.000 --> 41:18.439
- Is that what he told you?
- That's what I saw.

41:18.560 --> 41:23.359
- What you think you saw.
- Mum...I saw.

41:24.960 --> 41:28.239
- Just come home. Please.
- No.

41:28.360 --> 41:29.719
- I just want us to be...
- What?

41:29.840 --> 41:33.439
"Hello, world! Hello, neighbours!
Here we are!

41:33.560 --> 41:36.959
"Jenny and Caroline! We're normal!
Look how normal we are!"

41:38.600 --> 41:41.959
- You really are one evil little bitch.
- Yeah, well...

41:43.240 --> 41:45.439
...the apple didn't fall
far from the tree.

41:46.480 --> 41:47.439
What?

41:47.560 --> 41:50.079
Are you going to start smacking me about
a bit now?

41:50.200 --> 41:51.879
Do you know what?

41:52.000 --> 41:53.519
Go ahead.

41:55.360 --> 41:58.199
I've been hit by animals
a lot meaner than you.

42:03.960 --> 42:04.879
Take it.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.239
Keep it.

42:07.920 --> 42:10.519
Just take it. For food. For rent.

42:10.640 --> 42:11.999
I don't want your money.

42:12.120 --> 42:13.479
I'm getting a job.

42:13.600 --> 42:15.199
Have you got one yet?

42:15.320 --> 42:16.279
Not yet, no.

42:16.400 --> 42:18.719
- Then take it.
- I don't want your money.

42:20.800 --> 42:23.839
But if I was a strange man with
an erection and a video camera,

42:23.960 --> 42:25.879
then you'd take it, wouldn't you?

43:09.400 --> 43:10.639
Erin, what's up?

43:11.680 --> 43:12.879
You said I could come to you.

43:14.080 --> 43:15.319
Yeah, absolutely.

43:17.160 --> 43:18.799
I don't know what to do, Justin.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.239
- What about?
- Luther.

43:23.360 --> 43:26.439
Today, during the fire alarm,
he breaks into Schenk's office,

43:26.560 --> 43:28.079
accesses his computer.

43:28.200 --> 43:31.399
And don't say it, because I'm sure.
I wish I wasn't, but I am.

43:31.520 --> 43:33.799
He's got no need to.

43:35.480 --> 43:37.559
Access to the database is audited.

43:37.680 --> 43:41.359
I mean, why else use Schenk's computer?

43:41.480 --> 43:44.479
Whatever he was doing, he didn't want
anyone else to know he was doing it.

43:44.600 --> 43:45.839
Tell me that's not dirty.

43:48.200 --> 43:51.359
OK, yeah, on the face of it, it looks odd.

43:51.480 --> 43:53.319
But there'll be a reason.

43:54.720 --> 43:56.079
Oh, come on

43:56.200 --> 43:58.959
There's loyalty and then there's...
naivety.

43:59.080 --> 44:00.479
There's also a difference

44:00.600 --> 44:03.719
between getting your hands dirty
and being dirty.

44:06.160 --> 44:07.919
This is what I get, is it?

44:08.040 --> 44:10.319
I've come to you for help.
And this is it?

44:10.440 --> 44:13.879
Platitudes and denials and puppy-dog eyes?

44:18.640 --> 44:20.079
Right. Just leave it with me.

44:20.200 --> 44:22.919
- Right?
- Thank you.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.719
I'm DCI John Luther.

44:41.840 --> 44:43.679
Question is, who are you?

44:47.920 --> 44:51.639
Your fingerprints
didn't show up on the records.

44:52.720 --> 44:54.559
You're not carrying any ID.

44:54.680 --> 44:55.839
Just this.

45:01.240 --> 45:02.239
And these.

45:15.800 --> 45:16.799
What?

45:23.800 --> 45:27.039
Well, I've been using our quiet time...

45:29.400 --> 45:30.919
...to think about this.

45:31.040 --> 45:32.639
What is it?

45:32.760 --> 45:34.159
What could it be?

45:34.280 --> 45:35.799
Do you know what I think?

45:35.920 --> 45:38.039
I reckon it's a scorecard.

45:39.200 --> 45:44.559
How many points, what, ten points
for killing someone with a baseball bat?

45:46.120 --> 45:47.999
20 points for, I don't know,

45:48.120 --> 45:51.879
stabbing a stranger to death. Am I right?

45:52.000 --> 45:54.159
Is that what this is?

46:10.760 --> 46:12.239
Who were you trying to call...

46:13.920 --> 46:16.479
...at the office? Who was that?

46:16.600 --> 46:18.079
The wife?

46:20.280 --> 46:22.079
Girlfriend, boyfriend?

46:22.200 --> 46:23.639
Boyfriend.

46:24.680 --> 46:27.239
I didn't think it was your mum and dad.

46:27.360 --> 46:30.399
No, we checked the records,
and it was a disposable phone.

46:30.520 --> 46:33.719
The only time
that number has been called,

46:33.840 --> 46:35.639
so doesn't say Mum and Dad to me.

46:35.760 --> 46:37.559
Does that say Mum and Dad to you?

46:39.560 --> 46:41.439
So who was it?

46:41.560 --> 46:43.479
Who was it?

46:46.760 --> 46:48.399
Who was it?

46:53.880 --> 46:58.519
You know, I've been a police officer
since God was a boy.

47:00.160 --> 47:05.239
I don't think I've sat
across a table from someone

47:05.360 --> 47:09.839
who takes their right to silence
so seriously.

47:17.040 --> 47:19.039
Want to say something?

47:24.640 --> 47:26.119
No?

47:33.120 --> 47:34.639
Who are you?

47:35.680 --> 47:38.039
We'll find out, won't we?

48:08.880 --> 48:10.359
John?

48:15.000 --> 48:16.079
Oh!

48:17.080 --> 48:18.799
- Agh!
- Hello.

48:22.480 --> 48:23.719
You remember me?

48:24.920 --> 48:25.919
Of course you do.

48:27.480 --> 48:29.119
And what an evening that was!

48:31.080 --> 48:34.679
Well, I do apologise for any
work-related injuries that you sustained.

48:34.800 --> 48:36.279
Where is he?

48:37.840 --> 48:39.759
- The man of the house.
- Working.

48:39.880 --> 48:42.439
Bringing home the bacon, as it were.

48:43.520 --> 48:45.439
When will he be back?

48:45.560 --> 48:46.999
Whenever he can.

48:47.120 --> 48:48.679
- And when's that?
- Do I look like his wife?

48:48.800 --> 48:51.519
Darling, you don't look like
anybody's wife.

48:51.640 --> 48:53.479
So, anyway, door's that way.

48:55.720 --> 48:58.599
No, er, I can't leave.

48:59.680 --> 49:03.039
Not before the Big Bad John shows up...

49:03.160 --> 49:05.039
...and gives me what I'm waiting for.

49:18.400 --> 49:21.679
You know, I really must say,
he's being disappointingly tardy.

49:23.960 --> 49:27.119
Yeah, definitely more dial-up
than broadband.

49:27.240 --> 49:28.439
So you'd better be off, then.

49:32.280 --> 49:34.079
Did I hurt you that badly?

49:38.560 --> 49:40.079
I...

49:40.200 --> 49:41.679
I can't help it.

49:45.400 --> 49:46.999
It's the screams.

49:48.040 --> 49:49.679
See?

49:49.800 --> 49:51.999
I think they're rather like watches.

49:52.120 --> 49:53.639
On one level...

49:55.560 --> 49:56.559
...the fake ones are convincing enough...

49:56.560 --> 49:57.799
...the fake ones are convincing enough...

50:00.200 --> 50:02.679
...until you've tried the genuine article.

50:10.040 --> 50:11.799
What's that?

50:17.000 --> 50:19.079
- It's not yours!
- Ooh.

50:20.160 --> 50:21.639
Ooh.

50:24.440 --> 50:26.759
David Bowie.

50:26.880 --> 50:29.559
Oh, my God. That is so sweet.

50:30.840 --> 50:32.439
You do know you're ill?

50:33.480 --> 50:36.359
There's something wrong with you.

50:43.600 --> 50:45.239
Yeah, apparently, there is.

50:47.440 --> 50:50.079
When I was eight, they caught me...

50:51.320 --> 50:54.039
...interfering with
the corpse of a cat, and, er...

50:55.480 --> 50:57.719
...I told them it was
a scientific experiment.

50:57.840 --> 51:00.279
I was just trying to see
if there were any kittens inside.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.359
There were no kittens.

51:09.640 --> 51:11.599
How are you on the money front?

51:11.720 --> 51:13.719
- Don't you start.
- Cos I've got the money

51:13.840 --> 51:14.999
if you've got the time.

51:15.120 --> 51:18.799
- I don't do that any more.
- Oh, what, cos you've found yourself?

51:20.720 --> 51:22.759
Is it cos you've found some kind of

51:22.880 --> 51:25.159
pure core of strength and self-respect,
or is it because

51:25.280 --> 51:26.919
you're learning to love yourself
as a woman?

51:27.040 --> 51:31.279
You need to leave. If John comes back
and hears you talking to me like this...

51:31.400 --> 51:35.079
"Talking to me like this"?
I think John will do as he's told.

51:35.200 --> 51:37.679
I could have you bent over this table

51:37.800 --> 51:42.519
and there'd be nothing he could do
but stand back and watch.

51:44.240 --> 51:47.479
Besides which, John's not here, is he?

51:49.800 --> 51:50.959
Hmm?

51:51.080 --> 51:54.319
I told him what I wanted.

51:58.920 --> 52:00.599
I told him what I'd do.

52:01.960 --> 52:05.199
But John's not here. He's not here
for you, he's not here for me.

52:07.440 --> 52:10.399
I think he's let the both of us down.

52:11.440 --> 52:13.279
I'll, er, be very gentle.

52:13.400 --> 52:14.639
Or not.

52:16.040 --> 52:17.319
- Get out.
- Come on.

52:17.440 --> 52:18.879
- Get out!
- What is it?

52:19.000 --> 52:21.199
Has he got a thing for sullied goods?
Is that what it is?

52:21.320 --> 52:22.959
- Don't talk about him.
- Or does he like to be the hero?

52:23.080 --> 52:25.759
Putting pretty young things
into his bed for gratitude?

52:25.880 --> 52:29.279
Eh, what does he like? What's his scene?
What does he like? Hey?

52:29.400 --> 52:31.439
- Don't, please!
- Does he like this?

52:31.560 --> 52:32.599
Does he like this?

52:54.360 --> 52:56.439
Boss, have you got a minute?

52:56.560 --> 53:00.519
Yeah. Walk... Walk out with me.

53:04.560 --> 53:06.239
Everything all right?

53:07.280 --> 53:09.599
Um, with me, yeah.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.639
What does that mean?

53:13.880 --> 53:14.879
Um...

53:16.400 --> 53:17.999
Were you in Schenk's office?

53:20.560 --> 53:22.879
- When?
- Today, during the fire alarm.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.239
Who's told you that?

53:24.360 --> 53:26.159
No-one. It doesn't matter.

53:26.280 --> 53:28.559
Were you, though?

53:29.960 --> 53:32.399
- Justin, do you trust me?
- Yeah. You know I do.

53:32.520 --> 53:34.919
All right, well, don't say
what you're about to say.

53:37.080 --> 53:38.519
Are you in trouble?

53:46.680 --> 53:48.679
Things are a little messy.

53:48.800 --> 53:50.399
But I'm working it out.

54:04.360 --> 54:07.799
Toby, I've got it
and I'm ready to meet you,

54:07.920 --> 54:09.839
so just call me and tell me where.

55:11.600 --> 55:12.839
Jenny?

55:16.280 --> 55:17.519
Jenny, where are you?

55:18.560 --> 55:19.999
Are you home?

55:21.520 --> 55:23.399
Where are you?

55:23.520 --> 55:24.919
I'm sorry.

55:25.040 --> 55:27.719
I'm really, really sorry.
