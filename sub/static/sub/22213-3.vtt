00:01.102 --> 00:03.071
Previously on Chance...

00:03.171 --> 00:05.173
So, it sounds pretty fun.

00:05.273 --> 00:06.440
Friday night?

00:06.540 --> 00:08.109
I don't know
if it's gonna work.

00:08.209 --> 00:10.010
PEPPER:
People have been talking.

00:10.111 --> 00:12.880
Something they heard about that
happened at your old school?

00:12.980 --> 00:16.217
You ever have one of those cases
that keep you awake at night?

00:16.317 --> 00:17.685
This one's mine.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.853
Ryan Winter.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.789
D:
Fucking Hynes is obsessed.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.857
Whole timeline on his wall
about murder

00:23.957 --> 00:26.026
and where this Winter
was when.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.262
CHANCE:
You broke in to his place?

00:28.362 --> 00:32.600
I'm gonna need you to get into
Ryan Winter's head for me.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.303
I have some pictures
that I'd like to show you.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.705
Tell me what you see.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.940
Josefa, how's it going?

00:40.040 --> 00:41.709
He caught me
wearing makeup.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.411
My husband, Ronny.

00:43.511 --> 00:44.778
CHANCE:
I'm looking for Josefa Pefaur.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.947
I'm her psychiatrist.

00:47.047 --> 00:47.981
We had an appointment.
She didn't show.

00:48.082 --> 00:49.583
Is she inside?
Is she okay?

00:49.683 --> 00:52.153
OFFICER: I need you to go back
downstairs, sir,

00:52.253 --> 00:53.287
right now.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.488

00:56.657 --> 01:00.761

No, I thought it was two.

continue)

01:56.083 --> 01:59.153
**

01:59.253 --> 02:00.654
MAN: Her husband, Ronny.

02:00.754 --> 02:03.224
**

02:03.324 --> 02:05.058
WOMAN: Was it a robbery?

02:05.159 --> 02:06.560
**

02:06.660 --> 02:08.896
Hey. Hey.
Are you Ronny?

02:08.996 --> 02:10.198
Stay the fuck away from me.

02:10.298 --> 02:11.499
I'm trying to help you.

02:11.599 --> 02:12.966
What do you want?
I'm Dr. Chance --

02:13.066 --> 02:14.702
I don't know who the fuck
that is, okay?

02:14.802 --> 02:17.238
Look.
I'm Josefa's therapist

02:17.338 --> 02:18.906
at the Victims
of Violent Crimes Unit.

02:19.006 --> 02:20.741
You know what that is?

02:20.841 --> 02:23.244
(sirens wailing)
Don't run!

02:23.344 --> 02:24.878
Ronny, don't run.
They'll think you're guilty.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.214
Just stay where you are.

02:26.314 --> 02:27.548
I didn't do this, man!

02:27.648 --> 02:29.250
I didn't do this, okay?!
I --

02:29.350 --> 02:30.484
She was my wife.
I loved her!

02:30.584 --> 02:32.386
I-I did stuff, okay?

02:32.486 --> 02:33.654
I did stuff, but I ain't
no fucking murderer, man.

02:33.754 --> 02:34.755
I know. I know.

02:34.855 --> 02:35.823
I know you didn't do it,
Ronny.

02:35.923 --> 02:36.924
But you just got to
let me help you.

02:37.024 --> 02:39.327
Where were you?
Where you in the building?

02:39.427 --> 02:40.728
Fuck.
I'm so fucked, man.

02:40.828 --> 02:41.929
OFFICER: Hey!
Don't move.

02:42.029 --> 02:43.497
CHANCE:
You got to tell me quick.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.366
We don't have a lot of time.
Tell me where you were.
OFFICER: Hey!

02:45.466 --> 02:46.367
I'm so fucked.
I'm so fucked.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.402
Put your hands up.
You the husband?

02:48.502 --> 02:50.704
-Uh, yeah.
-We're just talking, Officer.

02:50.804 --> 02:53.040
-Who are you?
-Josefa Pefaur's therapist.

02:53.140 --> 02:55.576
Detectives need to speak to you,
Ronny. Come on, now. Let's go.

02:55.676 --> 02:56.577
RONNY: What,
I-I'm under arrest?

02:56.677 --> 02:59.247
It's up to you.
Y-You're being detained.

02:59.347 --> 03:00.514
What? Hey!

03:00.614 --> 03:02.550
What? I-I didn't do anything!
What?

03:02.650 --> 03:05.519
Detectives gonna want
to speak to you, too.

03:05.619 --> 03:06.520
**

03:06.620 --> 03:08.789
Did Mrs. Pefaur
ever tell you

03:08.889 --> 03:10.724
that her husband
had threatened to kill her?

03:10.824 --> 03:12.059
No.

03:12.159 --> 03:14.228
"No, not in those words,"
or...

03:14.328 --> 03:18.766
Just no.
She -- Uh, in no words, no.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.534
(telephone rings)

03:20.634 --> 03:22.270
Did she ever say
she was worried

03:22.370 --> 03:24.037
her husband might kill her?

03:25.706 --> 03:27.875
Does Ronny Pefaur have
an alibi?

03:27.975 --> 03:29.543
Is that a "no"?

03:29.643 --> 03:32.045
**

03:32.145 --> 03:34.615
(sighs)

03:34.715 --> 03:36.650
**

03:36.750 --> 03:38.586
**

03:38.686 --> 03:40.888
Plenty more
where this came from.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.590
**

03:42.690 --> 03:45.158
Yeah, I know.
I know what Josefa went through.

03:45.259 --> 03:47.227
And I know "addressing
the welfare of the patient"

03:47.328 --> 03:49.963
means protecting
confidentiality in perpetuity,

03:50.063 --> 03:51.499
but right now,

03:51.599 --> 03:53.967
a lady who everybody's saying
was kind of an angel

03:54.067 --> 03:57.905
is dead with her head
almost cut off.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.573
So here we are.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.809
Ronny Pefaur's alibi is

04:01.909 --> 04:03.311
he says
he was playing cards

04:03.411 --> 04:06.246
with some friends
at a chop shop in Bayview.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.448
You don't believe him?

04:07.548 --> 04:10.651
You know what, Doc?
I really don't.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.153
But how 'bout you tell me
why you seem to?

04:13.253 --> 04:15.856
(siren wails)

04:15.956 --> 04:18.692
I...

04:18.792 --> 04:21.261
I have another patient

04:21.362 --> 04:23.664
who was in group therapy
with Mrs. Pefaur.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.800
Now, recently, I gave him
a projective psychological test

04:26.900 --> 04:28.602
involving
interpreting images.

04:28.702 --> 04:31.004
When I saw Josefa's body,

04:31.104 --> 04:32.105
it was posed --

04:32.205 --> 04:34.675
it was posed exactly
like one of the images.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.877
I can get you a copy.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.546
This patient --

04:38.646 --> 04:41.148
if I run him, am I gonna find
any violent priors --

04:41.248 --> 04:43.984
assault, rape, abuse?

04:44.084 --> 04:46.019
(sighs)
No.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.888
Okay.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.358
Has he ever said he was going
to kill Mrs. Pefaur?

04:50.458 --> 04:53.961
No.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.464
Has he ever said he was gonna
kill a woman, kill anybody?

04:56.564 --> 04:59.199
No, I -- No.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.434
Okay.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.636
What we're left with, then,
is a feeling in your gut

05:02.736 --> 05:04.838
that something kind of looks
like something else.

05:04.938 --> 05:05.839
**

05:05.939 --> 05:08.976
Put up against a guy
on probation for battery

05:09.076 --> 05:12.012
with a history
of beating his wife,

05:12.112 --> 05:14.147
whose neighbors
called 911 on him for her

05:14.247 --> 05:17.050
26 times in 3 years.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.419
**

05:18.519 --> 05:20.354
You've got your gut, Doc,
and I've got mine.

05:20.454 --> 05:23.256
And here,
mine's the one that matters.

05:23.357 --> 05:24.992
**

05:25.092 --> 05:28.762
(siren wails)

05:28.862 --> 05:31.832
(horn honks, construction
equipment rattling in distance)

05:33.567 --> 05:35.503
**

05:35.603 --> 05:37.270
HYNES: The truth is
the job won't let me take

05:37.371 --> 05:41.041
this sick, murdering fuck
down the aboveboard way,

05:41.141 --> 05:43.076
so I'm doing
what needs to be done.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.612
WINTER: I envy you.
(sniffling)

05:44.712 --> 05:47.748
At least you know
who to be scared of.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.917
-You must get tired.
-You need my trust.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.952
Talking about this
so much...

05:52.052 --> 05:53.921
And I want
to give it to you.
...nothing changes.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.956
HYNES: You don't know
what you're doing.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.058
(bus horn blares)

05:59.292 --> 06:05.966
**

06:06.066 --> 06:07.234
**

06:07.334 --> 06:09.403
(keys clack)

06:09.503 --> 06:12.473
(indistinct chatter)

06:12.573 --> 06:16.610
**

06:16.710 --> 06:20.047
**

06:20.147 --> 06:22.983
(engine starts)

06:23.083 --> 06:25.653
**

06:25.753 --> 06:28.221
What if it was this Ronny?

06:28.321 --> 06:30.223
Why is that so crazy?
The guy's a shit stain.

06:30.323 --> 06:32.726
No, this was Winter, D.

06:32.826 --> 06:35.395
If you'd seen the way
he's zeroed in on Josefa --

06:35.496 --> 06:39.767
Not because he was commiserating
or sharing out of empathy.

06:39.867 --> 06:42.570
Hard-ons aren't a gateway drug
for murder.

06:42.670 --> 06:43.837
We know Winter's
a sick piece of shit.

06:43.937 --> 06:47.140
Does Ronny really have
an alibi?

06:47.240 --> 06:50.310
Yes, actually, he does.

06:50.410 --> 06:55.616
**

06:55.716 --> 06:57.685
You ever have
one of those moments

06:57.785 --> 07:01.489
where, suddenly,
everything makes sense?

07:01.589 --> 07:02.956
**

07:06.193 --> 07:12.165
**

07:12.265 --> 07:14.702
Fuck me.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.303
You know
what would be interesting

07:16.403 --> 07:18.839
is if we were compare
this shit

07:18.939 --> 07:22.209
to the coroner's report
on Blackstone.

07:22.309 --> 07:24.177
Depth of cuts,
nature of wounds

07:24.277 --> 07:26.346
as in what caused them --

07:26.446 --> 07:28.616
single blade, double blade,

07:28.716 --> 07:32.520
serrated edge,
curved versus straight.

07:32.620 --> 07:35.889
Hell, I'd say you pretty much
have them all covered here.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.357
**

07:37.457 --> 07:39.459
And here, I thought
I'd found a pal.

07:39.560 --> 07:42.329
I saw a soul in distress.

07:42.429 --> 07:43.497
You had
my sympathies,

07:43.597 --> 07:44.665
and you still do.

07:44.765 --> 07:45.633
Save it, Pops.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.635
**

07:47.735 --> 07:52.072
You know, I remember what was
bugging me at the bar now.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.675
You're that natty,
older gentleman

07:54.775 --> 07:56.043
who crashed his car

07:56.143 --> 08:00.013
into some Romanians
out at the beach.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.516
Manny, Moe, and Jack.

08:02.616 --> 08:07.921
So, what's that make you?
A dirty, blackmailing cop.

08:08.021 --> 08:14.094
**

08:14.194 --> 08:17.531
Josefa Pefaur.

08:17.631 --> 08:18.732
What the hell
does that mean?

08:18.832 --> 08:19.933
She was a patient of mine
at the clinic.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.869
She was murdered
in her apartment.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.236
I was at the crime scene.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.938
I got a glimpse
of the body.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.941
It was posed to mimic a drawing
that I had shown Winter.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.743
He reacted
to something in her story,

08:29.843 --> 08:31.044
and then
the drawing provoked

08:31.144 --> 08:34.181
something
he couldn't articulate.

08:34.281 --> 08:40.120
**

08:40.220 --> 08:41.388
So, what now?

08:41.488 --> 08:45.392
How about now,
Winter goes away?

08:45.492 --> 08:47.394
Meaning what, exactly?

08:47.494 --> 08:49.563
Meaning somebody stabs him
in the fucking eye.

08:49.663 --> 08:52.766
He goes away
when I say he goes away,

08:52.866 --> 08:55.535
in the court of law
where I can see it.

08:55.636 --> 08:58.271
Now, if you've got a problem
with that, say so right now.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.207
He doesn't.
Neither do I.

09:00.307 --> 09:01.609
Well, fantastic.

09:01.709 --> 09:02.776
So, where do we start?

09:02.876 --> 09:04.578
**

09:04.678 --> 09:06.379
(horn honks in distance)

09:07.648 --> 09:09.382
Well, first thing is
that I have to keep Winter

09:09.482 --> 09:10.584
out of the clinic.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.953
Your problem is that the cops
decided to hang this

09:13.053 --> 09:14.321
on Josefa's husband, Ronny.

09:14.421 --> 09:15.488
He has an alibi,

09:15.589 --> 09:17.625
but no one seems that inclined
to believe it.

09:17.725 --> 09:18.726
Well, did he tell you
what it was?

09:18.826 --> 09:20.794
I believe it.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.063
**

09:23.163 --> 09:27.434
Well, I have Legal Aid lawyer
who actually owes me a favor,

09:27.534 --> 09:28.802
and he'll actually
be jazzed

09:28.936 --> 09:30.604
to have a client
who didn't do it.

09:30.704 --> 09:33.273
I'll call him tomorrow
because tonight,

09:33.373 --> 09:38.011
we're gonna go corroborate
the husband's alibi.

09:38.111 --> 09:39.012
**

09:39.112 --> 09:41.014
And if you're riding along,
big fella,

09:41.114 --> 09:42.983
know this...
(coin clinks)

09:43.083 --> 09:44.417
**

09:44.517 --> 09:46.486
You ever break
into my apartment again,

09:46.586 --> 09:49.857
I'll stab you
in the fucking eye.

10:03.804 --> 10:07.107
Hey, Nicole!
Nicole!

10:07.207 --> 10:09.877
Hey. Didn't you
hear me calling you?

10:09.977 --> 10:11.945
Guess not.

10:12.045 --> 10:14.514
I feel really bad about
what happened with Jason.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.116
It's not about him.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.718
Well, still, whatever.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.687
He didn't have to be
such a dick about it.

10:21.021 --> 10:24.024
My advice?
Just move on.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.325
Forget about it.
Seriously.

10:25.425 --> 10:26.994
Just like
it never even happened.

10:27.094 --> 10:28.996
How can I?

10:29.096 --> 10:33.466
It followed me here,
and it's all over the Internet.

10:33.566 --> 10:36.069
I can't believe I have to live
with this forever.

10:38.005 --> 10:40.674
And, you know, what pisses me
off more than anything

10:40.774 --> 10:44.411
is that all anyone cares about
is John's side of the story.

10:44.511 --> 10:46.814
Nobody even asks me
for mine.

10:46.914 --> 10:48.048
I'm not a psycho.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.517
Look. I get it.

10:50.617 --> 10:53.086
We have all done
dumb shit over guys before.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.487
(chuckles)

10:54.587 --> 10:57.590
So your shit just got
a little bit dumber.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.659
Who cares?
Trust me.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.528
In two days,
everybody will be on

11:01.628 --> 11:04.231
to somebody else's
dumb shit, okay?

11:04.331 --> 11:06.033
Okay.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.701
Hey. Uh.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.202
Let's go get some pizza.

11:09.302 --> 11:12.940
(indistinct conversations)

11:13.040 --> 11:14.742
Come on.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.543
Okay.

11:32.726 --> 11:34.728
What?

11:34.828 --> 11:36.596
What is this shit?!

11:36.696 --> 11:38.098
It's his music.

What the fuck
are you doing?

11:43.003 --> 11:44.738
Look, I'm not gonna sit here
and listen

11:44.838 --> 11:46.706
to "The Best of Cries
from Hell."

11:46.807 --> 11:47.908
What the fuck?

11:48.008 --> 11:50.443
Look, Doc, I don't know
if you need Sitting Bull here

11:50.543 --> 11:51.812
to tag along, but I don't.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.446
Keep talking, asshole.

11:53.546 --> 11:54.915
You're about five seconds away

11:55.015 --> 11:56.483
from the most humiliating moment
of your life.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.819
Listen to me,
you big fuck.

11:58.919 --> 12:01.321
I got no problem
pulling the car over right now

12:01.421 --> 12:03.256
and putting a bullet
in your fucking head.

12:03.356 --> 12:04.992
Fantastic.

12:05.092 --> 12:07.127
There's a dump site a quarter
of a mile up on the right.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.661
You can do it there.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.764
That way, I can bury your body
after I --

Jesus Christ!

12:12.833 --> 12:15.002

out of this car.

just fucking knock it off?!

12:48.268 --> 12:49.636
Listen.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.638
I'm here
because you need me.

12:51.738 --> 12:53.440
He's here
because I need him.

12:53.540 --> 12:56.043
Now, let's all just take
a deep fucking breath

12:56.143 --> 12:58.946
and go do what we came to do.

12:59.046 --> 13:01.381
This ain't over.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.516
I mean, how the fuck

13:03.616 --> 13:09.122
you're not doing life
without parole is beyond me.

Let's go.

(car door opens)

13:14.494 --> 13:17.330
How do you lead this fuck-nut
to my place?

13:17.430 --> 13:18.899
I know.
I'm sorry.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.300

13:20.400 --> 13:24.071

everything we've done.

in trouble.

All's I need you to say

14:13.853 --> 14:17.424
is that you were here two nights
ago with Ronny, that's all.

14:19.927 --> 14:22.529

be gone quite a while.

Was it someone I've met?

Josefa Pefaur.

Uh-huh.

I am so sorry
to hear that.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.638
She seemed nice.

**

16:13.340 --> 16:17.210
As I recall, you two talked
quite extensively.

Yeah.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.849
Misery loves company.

16:22.949 --> 16:26.053
That's an interesting way
to sum up a life.

Oh, I-I wasn't trying
to be glib.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.357

You seem more relaxed
than when we last spoke.

16:33.160 --> 16:36.063
**

16:36.163 --> 16:38.865
Must be the massage I got
last night.

16:38.965 --> 16:41.334
**

16:41.434 --> 16:43.070
In any case,
group is canceled today

16:43.170 --> 16:47.107
in light
of Josefa's death.

16:47.207 --> 16:48.341
You want to take a walk,
you and me?

16:48.441 --> 16:49.876
You -- Uh, did you say
group was canceled?

16:49.976 --> 16:51.111
Uh-huh.
Okay.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.880
Nobody mentioned anything
about that.

16:53.980 --> 16:55.848
Well,
I'm mentioning it now.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.684
**

16:57.784 --> 17:00.453
(inhales deeply)

17:00.553 --> 17:02.422
Okay, sure.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.624
Do you want to wait for me
in the lobby?

17:04.724 --> 17:06.426
I just got to make
a quick call.

17:06.526 --> 17:10.063
Yes.
Take your time.

(cellphone buzzes)

17:25.612 --> 17:26.779
Yeah?

17:26.879 --> 17:28.881
CHANCE:
Winter is here in my office,

17:28.981 --> 17:30.750
cool
as a fucking cucumber.

17:30.850 --> 17:31.751
No shit.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.720
Why wouldn't he be,
he's the psycho you say?

17:33.820 --> 17:35.122
But there's something
I noticed --

17:35.222 --> 17:37.124
change rattles him.

17:37.224 --> 17:40.293
It's pretty common
in obsessive-compulsives,

17:40.393 --> 17:42.895
but it might be something
we can use --

17:42.995 --> 17:44.063
some way of disrupting
his routine,

17:44.164 --> 17:45.998
getting under his skin.
Gaslight the fucker.

17:46.099 --> 17:47.400
**

17:47.500 --> 17:50.137
If I keep him here,
can you get into his house?

17:50.237 --> 17:53.606
Already out the door,
Doc.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.842
**

17:58.411 --> 17:59.746
(birds chirping)

17:59.846 --> 18:03.150
**

18:03.250 --> 18:05.518
**

18:05.618 --> 18:11.324
**

18:11.424 --> 18:12.692
CHANCE:
When you were first admitted

18:12.792 --> 18:14.194
to the hospital,

18:14.294 --> 18:15.762
I ordered a PET scan.

18:15.862 --> 18:18.498
Allows us to look
at the glucose uptake

18:18.598 --> 18:21.868
or metabolism in the different
areas of the brain.

18:21.968 --> 18:23.636
You see that area there?

18:23.736 --> 18:28.341
It's the cingulate gyrus,
part of the limbic system.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.942
WINTER:
What about it?

18:30.042 --> 18:31.311
Well,
it's pretty interesting.

18:31.411 --> 18:34.947
Hypermetabolism in the front
part of the cingulate

18:35.047 --> 18:37.016
correlates
to obsessional thinking.

18:37.116 --> 18:41.020
Hypometabolism,
low glucose uptake,

18:41.120 --> 18:43.456
suggests
a lack of empathy.

18:43.556 --> 18:44.724
We're basically talking
about the way

18:44.824 --> 18:47.126
that ideas and emotions
link up.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.861
**

18:48.961 --> 18:52.532
And this is related
to decision-making?

18:52.632 --> 18:53.800
Yeah.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.968
Impulse control.

18:56.068 --> 18:59.138
Impulse control.
Okay.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.708
So, what does this show,
exactly?

19:01.808 --> 19:04.211
Well, it suggests, maybe,

19:04.311 --> 19:06.179
a certain lack of empathy

19:06.279 --> 19:10.683
combined with a need
to take control.

19:10.783 --> 19:13.686
**

19:13.786 --> 19:16.523
An ability to take risks,
do dangerous things

19:16.623 --> 19:18.725
while remaining
emotionally detached.

19:18.825 --> 19:19.759
**

19:19.859 --> 19:23.029
Kind of sangfroid
with attention to detail.

19:23.129 --> 19:26.366
And this is a result
of my attack?

19:26.466 --> 19:29.001
No. This is the brain
you were born with.
Hold on.

19:29.101 --> 19:33.440
It sounds like
you're describing a psychopath.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.408
**

19:35.508 --> 19:37.544
All this does is
it just shows a proclivity

19:37.644 --> 19:38.611
for certain kinds
of behavior.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.680
(scoffs)
It's just science.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.882
All the events
and experiences we have,

19:42.982 --> 19:45.418
they also shape
who and what we become.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.019
It's not just nature.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.088
You also need some...

19:49.188 --> 19:53.526
destructive nurturing
to become a psychopath.

19:53.626 --> 19:57.397
So...it's not my fault.
(sighs)

19:57.497 --> 20:00.433
I mean, it's not my fault
if I was born this way.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.235
**

20:02.335 --> 20:04.437
What's not your fault?

20:04.537 --> 20:06.939
**

20:07.039 --> 20:11.043
**

20:11.143 --> 20:13.112
My glibness.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.214
**

20:15.315 --> 20:16.549
I'd say that's possible.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.651
**

20:18.751 --> 20:20.119
Can I ask you something?

20:20.219 --> 20:23.923
Um, I'm a open book,
apparently.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.792
(chuckles)

20:25.892 --> 20:28.094
Are there things
you've done,

20:28.194 --> 20:31.998
things -- things
that you don't understand,

20:32.098 --> 20:33.500
things that make you go,
"Why?

20:33.600 --> 20:34.767
Where did that come from?"

20:34.867 --> 20:36.969
(horn honks)

20:37.069 --> 20:38.605
**

20:38.705 --> 20:41.274
Bad things, you mean?

20:41.374 --> 20:42.742
**

20:42.842 --> 20:45.312
Not necessarily.

20:45.412 --> 20:46.413
Our moral decisions

20:46.513 --> 20:49.115
are essentially
emotional decisions.

20:49.215 --> 20:50.583
It's just rooted
in our ability to --

20:50.683 --> 20:53.853
to know what another person
is feeling.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.988
That part of your brain
is compromised --

20:56.088 --> 20:57.524
Listen, I-I, um --

20:57.624 --> 21:00.527
I'm not pulling the wings
off of flies,

21:00.627 --> 21:02.795
if that's what
you're asking.

21:02.895 --> 21:04.163
**

21:04.263 --> 21:06.165
Of course not.

to where she no longer n--

**

24:58.931 --> 25:04.003
**

25:04.103 --> 25:06.272
-Oh, there he is.
-Mm.

25:06.372 --> 25:07.373
Eldon Chance, this is...

25:07.473 --> 25:10.042
Hi, Frank Lambert,
Assistant District Attorney.

25:10.142 --> 25:11.844
This is Barry Gilyard.

25:11.944 --> 25:12.879
He's our
chief investigator.

25:12.979 --> 25:13.913
I've been telling them

25:15.147 --> 25:15.548
about the outstanding progress
you were making with Josefa.

25:15.648 --> 25:18.551
Yeah.

25:18.651 --> 25:21.788
Yeah, it's, uh --
it's very sad.

25:21.888 --> 25:24.090
She was really starting
to take control of her life.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.524
Well, I'm sorry
that we can't be meeting

25:25.625 --> 25:27.927
under better circumstances,
but the good news is

25:28.027 --> 25:31.864
we just charged Ronaldo Pefaur
with the murder of his wife,

25:31.964 --> 25:34.266
so I'll be prosecuting
that case personally.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.803
And I promise you,
we'll pull out all the stops.

25:38.437 --> 25:40.707
So, Ronny's alibi
didn't check out?

25:40.807 --> 25:41.708
They rarely do.

25:42.709 --> 25:44.644
The reason that we --
we wanted to talk to you

25:44.744 --> 25:45.912
was to see if you could
give us any information

25:46.012 --> 25:48.380
about Josefa's relationship,

25:48.480 --> 25:50.750
uh, from a doctor-patient
perspective.

25:50.850 --> 25:54.553
Well, obviously, we know that
he was a serial abuser, so...

25:54.654 --> 25:56.455
Ronny Pefaur
had a history of assault.

25:56.555 --> 26:00.226
He's got multiple arrests,
some prison time,

26:00.326 --> 26:04.096
but Josefa never said
he used a weapon against her.

26:04.196 --> 26:08.100
Why would he suddenly
attack her with a knife?

26:08.200 --> 26:09.168
Well,
sometimes a perpetrator,

26:10.369 --> 26:11.137
when they feel they're not
making enough of an impression,

26:11.237 --> 26:13.305
they take it
to the next level.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.975
A foot-and-fist guy
goes and gets a knife.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.310
A knife guy
might go and get a gun.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.613
We call it
"conflict escalation."

26:20.713 --> 26:21.814
So do we.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.449
GILYARD:
This happens all the time,

26:23.549 --> 26:24.516
just like the accused

26:24.617 --> 26:25.685
trying to finger
somebody else.

26:26.919 --> 26:27.987
But this guy's hitting
on all the dirtbag landmarks.
Yeah.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.857
Ronny's tried to put this
on someone else? Who?

26:30.957 --> 26:33.425
He's floating a story about
being on a bus

26:33.525 --> 26:35.327
and seeing his wife walking
with some white guy,

26:35.427 --> 26:37.296
but by the time he got
off of the bus,

26:37.396 --> 26:38.530
they were gone, of course.

26:38.631 --> 26:39.632
So you don't believe him?

26:39.732 --> 26:40.833
No, sure I do.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.035
Also, Nicole Brown Simpson
was murdered

26:43.135 --> 26:44.303
by Colombian drug dealers.

26:44.403 --> 26:45.938
Okay.
(Kirsten clears throat)

26:46.038 --> 26:47.473
Look, I just want to say

26:47.573 --> 26:49.676
I-I know you don't hear this
from City Hall enough,

26:49.776 --> 26:50.810
but you guys here

26:50.910 --> 26:53.946
are one of the few
absolute goods in this world,

26:54.046 --> 26:55.314
so, I know it's tough,

26:55.414 --> 26:57.383
but keep on doing
what you're doing.

26:57.483 --> 27:01.020
That's kind of you to say.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.322
And we should go.

27:03.422 --> 27:06.793
Thank you for your time.
(clears throat)

27:08.995 --> 27:09.896
-Thank you.
-We'll be in touch.

27:09.996 --> 27:10.997
Thank you.

Oh, my God,
I am starving.

27:22.274 --> 27:23.309
(chuckling) Dude,
what did you order?

27:23.409 --> 27:25.144
Just plain pizza,
I swear.

27:25.244 --> 27:26.913
I seriously think
they forgot about us.

27:27.013 --> 27:27.880
(chuckling) I know.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.315
Oh, my God.

27:29.415 --> 27:31.150

Order 54!

27:36.188 --> 27:38.991
**

27:39.091 --> 27:41.761
So, you're still friends
with him?

27:41.861 --> 27:43.730
No, uh, but, I mean,

27:43.830 --> 27:45.164
I've known them since, like,
second grade, Nic.

27:45.264 --> 27:47.767
You know, it'd be super weird
if I just randomly

27:47.867 --> 27:49.435
acted like
I didn't know them, you know?

27:49.535 --> 27:50.703
No, I get it.

27:50.803 --> 27:52.839
Sorry.
That was stupid.
No.

WOMAN: 57!

27:55.107 --> 27:56.108

**

28:23.836 --> 28:25.371
What's up?

28:25.471 --> 28:26.438
You got a text.

28:26.538 --> 28:27.874
Oh.

28:27.974 --> 28:29.809
Sorry about that.

28:29.909 --> 28:32.611
You never mentioned
you knew Jamie Stahl.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.546
Oh, yeah.

28:34.646 --> 28:36.415
Why?
Do you know her?

28:36.515 --> 28:37.583

28:37.683 --> 28:40.119

28:44.156 --> 28:46.425
Yeah, uh,
my cousin and her

28:46.525 --> 28:48.660
do, like, aerial gymnastics
together or something.

28:48.761 --> 28:50.262
I don't know.
It's weird.

28:50.362 --> 28:51.597
But I met her,
like, one time,

28:51.697 --> 28:52.832
then you know
how it is --

28:52.932 --> 28:53.933
All of a sudden,
they want to be

28:54.033 --> 28:55.134
best friends
on social media

28:55.234 --> 28:57.403

You spread that shit around

Dude,
what are you talking about?

29:10.616 --> 29:13.485
You know
what I'm talking about.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.822
Why would you do that
to me?

29:15.922 --> 29:17.623
Okay, Nicole, just --
Why would you tell
everybody?

29:17.723 --> 29:19.792
Nicole, chill out.

29:19.892 --> 29:20.927
And then just sit here,
acting like my friend?

They didn't care.

you're an easy close.

29:54.460 --> 29:55.694
You're a drug addict

29:55.794 --> 29:56.863
with a history
of domestic abuse.

29:56.963 --> 30:00.066
How many fucking times
do I have to say it?

30:00.166 --> 30:02.401
I did not kill her.

30:02.501 --> 30:03.970
Well,
they think you did.

30:04.070 --> 30:05.171
RONNY: Yeah.

that line of thinking.

30:13.846 --> 30:17.984
if this is the guy
you saw walking with Josefa,

30:18.084 --> 30:19.218

absolutely sure --

the fucking picture, man.

30:30.462 --> 30:33.399
Because what's
a motherfucker like that

30:33.499 --> 30:34.566
doing in my neighborhood,

30:34.666 --> 30:37.669
walking with my wife,
with --

**

30:39.438 --> 30:41.840
He's lucky
I couldn't get off that bus.

30:41.941 --> 30:45.111
If not, I'd be here wearing
the orange for the real deal.

30:45.211 --> 30:48.014
Hey, hey, wait.
Wait! W-What now?

30:48.114 --> 30:49.715
You-- You're gonna tell the cops
about this fucker?

30:49.815 --> 30:52.351
Y-You gonna
get me out of here or what?

30:52.451 --> 30:55.121
As we speak,
a competent Legal Aid attorney

I might have to thank you
after all, Doc.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.629
I'm not doing this
for you.

31:03.729 --> 31:05.697

you deserve to be in here --

for killing her,

31:50.109 --> 31:51.277
I'm in Pacific Heights
at the moment.

31:51.377 --> 31:53.745
I can come to you.

31:53.845 --> 31:55.681
I can't come
to your office?

31:55.781 --> 31:58.084
Why not?

31:58.184 --> 31:59.785
I feel like you don't
want me there anymore.

31:59.885 --> 32:02.321
I told you,
I'm not at the hospital.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.623
It's just easier
if I come to you.

32:07.493 --> 32:08.494
Fine.

32:08.594 --> 32:11.930
**

32:12.031 --> 32:14.333
(sighs)
I'm being fucked with.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.368
What do you mean,
"fucked with"?

32:16.468 --> 32:17.536
(sighs)

32:17.636 --> 32:19.038
Someone's
broken into my house

32:19.138 --> 32:21.773
and taken things,
moved things.

32:21.873 --> 32:23.609
**

32:23.709 --> 32:25.111
Did you call
the police?
No.

32:25.211 --> 32:26.212
It's -- It's -- It's --

32:26.312 --> 32:29.715
It's --
It's not a police matter.

32:29.815 --> 32:31.717
Well, it is
if they stole something.

32:31.817 --> 32:33.185
You should call.
No.

32:33.285 --> 32:37.356
What they stole has no value
other than to me.

32:37.456 --> 32:38.790
**

32:38.890 --> 32:41.460
I'm sorry, Ryan,
I-I don't really understand.

32:41.560 --> 32:42.995
They moved things --

32:43.095 --> 32:44.663
belongings,
possessions.

32:44.763 --> 32:47.633
They were here.
Now they are here.

32:47.733 --> 32:49.135
And before you say it,
it wasn't the housekeeper

32:49.235 --> 32:51.703
or me forgetting
where I put things.

32:51.803 --> 32:56.042
**

32:56.142 --> 32:58.344
I think it's him.

32:58.444 --> 33:00.412
**

33:00.512 --> 33:02.714
Who?

33:02.814 --> 33:06.652
Ryan, if you got a name,
you should go to the police.

33:06.752 --> 33:08.887
**

33:08.987 --> 33:11.323
He is the police.

33:11.423 --> 33:12.591
**

33:12.691 --> 33:15.561
It's Detective Kevin Hynes.

33:15.661 --> 33:16.995
He used to be SFPD,

33:17.096 --> 33:20.499
but he was transferred
to the southeast suburbs.

33:20.599 --> 33:21.733
(sighs)

33:21.833 --> 33:24.170
And I bet you he's the one
that attacked me, too.

33:24.270 --> 33:28.407
**

33:28.507 --> 33:30.842
Ryan, I-I don't mean
to dismiss what you're saying,

33:30.942 --> 33:33.245
but I'm concerned
that this might be an extension

33:33.345 --> 33:34.613
of your head trauma.

33:34.713 --> 33:36.048
It's not. It's not.
It's not.

33:36.148 --> 33:38.550
I'm telling you,
this Hynes guy,

33:38.650 --> 33:40.586
he's like...

33:40.686 --> 33:41.887
He's like a burr.
He is stuck to me.

33:41.987 --> 33:46.592
He's made it his mission in life
to hound me to my grave.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.294
(sighs shakily)

33:48.394 --> 33:51.397
I hate this.
I hate feeling weak.

33:51.497 --> 33:53.632
I hate feeling
fucking scared.

33:53.732 --> 33:54.966
I hate feeling
like a victim.

33:55.067 --> 33:56.135
I don't like it.
I don't like it.

33:56.235 --> 33:57.736
It's okay. It's okay.
It's all right.

33:57.836 --> 33:59.905
(sighs)
Come on. Just...

34:00.005 --> 34:00.939
**

34:01.039 --> 34:02.074
(exhales deeply)

34:02.174 --> 34:04.410
It's okay, Ryan.

34:04.510 --> 34:06.312
We're gonna work
through this together.

34:06.412 --> 34:08.880
You once told me
I have your trust.

34:08.980 --> 34:10.582
Is that still true?

34:10.682 --> 34:11.783
**

34:11.883 --> 34:15.921
(sighing)

34:16.021 --> 34:21.327
**

34:21.427 --> 34:25.831
When I was 8, I was standing
on a train platform

34:25.931 --> 34:28.734
in Emeryville
with my mother.

34:28.834 --> 34:32.904
And not that far from us,
there was this little boy.

34:33.004 --> 34:35.841
He was running in a circle

34:35.941 --> 34:37.176
round and round
the platform.

34:37.276 --> 34:39.311
**

34:39.411 --> 34:44.015
After a while,
we could hear the train coming.

34:44.116 --> 34:45.784
**

34:45.884 --> 34:47.119
And...

34:47.219 --> 34:49.020
**

34:49.121 --> 34:50.656
I remember the boy
still circling,

34:50.756 --> 34:55.161
you know,
as it got closer.

34:55.261 --> 34:58.130
And then...

34:58.230 --> 34:59.665
**

34:59.765 --> 35:04.303
...everyone was screaming,
and he was gone.

35:04.403 --> 35:06.138
**

35:06.238 --> 35:08.307
This woman had come
out of the crowd, grabbed him,

35:08.407 --> 35:11.210
and tossed him
in front of the train.

35:11.310 --> 35:13.979
**

35:14.079 --> 35:20.719
**

35:20.819 --> 35:25.191
**

35:25.291 --> 35:27.493
(quietly sobbing)

35:27.593 --> 35:32.864
**

35:32.964 --> 35:37.336
(high-pitched ringing)

35:37.436 --> 35:42.140
**

35:42.241 --> 35:44.543
(body thuds)

35:44.643 --> 35:46.678
(ringing stops)

35:46.778 --> 35:49.915
(breathes deeply)

35:50.015 --> 35:53.185
(sobbing continues)

35:57.989 --> 35:59.325
(breathes sharply)

36:02.728 --> 36:03.895
(sighs)

36:03.995 --> 36:06.932
It was hard.
It was really hard.

36:07.032 --> 36:08.667
(sighs)

36:08.767 --> 36:11.036
But I figured it out.

36:11.136 --> 36:12.938
I found a way

36:13.038 --> 36:17.776
to calm myself,
to cope.

36:21.713 --> 36:24.450
We should talk
about that.

36:27.686 --> 36:28.754
Some other day.

36:28.854 --> 36:31.022
Today,
I think I'm done.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.195
(keys clack)

36:37.296 --> 36:38.864
(door opens)

36:38.964 --> 36:41.733
(indistinct conversations
in distance)

36:41.833 --> 36:43.201
You're a fucking lawyer?

36:43.302 --> 36:45.904
I'm your lawyer.

36:46.004 --> 36:47.873
Chuck Haden.

36:47.973 --> 36:50.476
Dude, I...I can't pay you,
man, so...

36:50.576 --> 36:51.743
It's okay.

36:51.843 --> 36:52.811
I'm Legal Aid.

36:52.911 --> 36:55.314
I'm replacing
your public defender on this.

36:55.414 --> 36:58.417
All right, so, you --
y-you can prove I'm innocent?

36:58.517 --> 37:00.452
Oh, we got plenty
to fight 'em on,

37:00.552 --> 37:03.955
and Judge Salandrigas and I,
we surf together,

37:04.055 --> 37:05.391
so that'll count
for something.

37:05.491 --> 37:07.626
(breathes deeply)

37:07.726 --> 37:09.661
Am -- Am I getting
out of here?

37:09.761 --> 37:12.230
Yeah.
Your mom posted your bail.

37:12.331 --> 37:14.165
But the condition will be
that you stay at her place.

37:14.266 --> 37:18.670
But the important thing is
you're gonna get released, okay?

37:18.770 --> 37:19.738
But you got to be smart,
though --

37:19.838 --> 37:21.740
no drugs,
no more incidents.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.742
Well, hey, well --
You're asking me to lay low?

37:23.842 --> 37:24.743
Mm-hmm.

37:24.843 --> 37:27.679
Shit.
I know how to do that.

37:27.779 --> 37:28.747
Good.
Sign there.

37:28.847 --> 37:30.616
(pen scratches)

37:32.250 --> 37:33.919
(thudding)
(doorbell dings)

37:34.019 --> 37:35.454
(door closes)

37:35.554 --> 37:37.423
(thudding continues)

37:39.491 --> 37:40.859
(horns honking in distance)

37:40.959 --> 37:42.661
(thudding continues)

37:44.463 --> 37:47.165
(thudding continues)

37:53.605 --> 37:55.507
**

37:55.607 --> 37:58.877
(grunts)

37:58.977 --> 38:02.614
Hey.
I didn't hear you come in.

38:02.714 --> 38:04.650
You looking
for the Doc?

38:04.750 --> 38:06.151
Not here.

38:06.251 --> 38:09.054
(thudding resumes)
Figured.

38:09.154 --> 38:12.958
I tried the office.
He's not there, either.

38:13.058 --> 38:14.893
I don't know why
people carry cellphones

38:14.993 --> 38:17.162
if they're not gonna
answer them. (sniffles)

38:17.262 --> 38:18.364
(siren wailing in distance)

38:18.464 --> 38:20.165
(indistinct shouting
in distance)

38:20.265 --> 38:21.800
(sobs quietly,
sniffles)

38:21.900 --> 38:23.835
I wouldn't do that.

38:23.935 --> 38:25.971
There's no crying in here.

38:26.071 --> 38:27.473
(thudding resumes)

38:27.573 --> 38:29.174
(chuckles, sniffles)

38:29.274 --> 38:32.378
(horns honk in distance)

38:34.012 --> 38:36.548
That would hurt.

38:36.648 --> 38:37.749
That would be the idea.

38:37.849 --> 38:39.050
You ever hit a person
like that?

38:39.150 --> 38:40.251
I have.

38:40.352 --> 38:41.820
He still alive?

38:41.920 --> 38:43.188
Some of them.

38:43.288 --> 38:44.590
(thudding continues)

38:44.690 --> 38:47.926
So where do I get
one of those?

38:48.026 --> 38:49.995
What is that,
a nightstick?

38:50.095 --> 38:52.598
(breathing heavily)

38:52.698 --> 38:54.032
Depends.

38:54.132 --> 38:55.501
Why would you want one?

38:55.601 --> 38:59.070
(honking continues)

38:59.170 --> 39:00.839
(inhales deeply)

39:00.939 --> 39:04.576
(voice breaking)
There's this asshole at school

39:04.676 --> 39:08.947
who's done
some shitty stuff,

39:09.047 --> 39:11.717
bullied me or whatever.

39:11.817 --> 39:13.585
Great opportunity
for a life lesson.

39:13.685 --> 39:16.455
Anytime
somebody bullies you,

39:16.555 --> 39:19.425
you should thank them
every day.

39:19.525 --> 39:21.460
**

39:21.560 --> 39:23.562
You're joking, right?

39:23.662 --> 39:27.132
Right now, this bully is
the only person in your life

39:27.232 --> 39:30.068
who's giving you
an actual challenge.

39:30.168 --> 39:31.069
**

39:31.169 --> 39:34.440
Everybody else
is anesthetizing you,

39:34.540 --> 39:35.941
hugging the power
out of you,

39:36.041 --> 39:37.576
making you weak.

39:37.676 --> 39:41.146
You think the struggle of living
in the world gets easier,

39:41.246 --> 39:44.249
people stop giving you
a hard time?

39:44.349 --> 39:46.384
Learn
to stand up for yourself now,

39:46.485 --> 39:49.120
and give it
right back to them.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.388
Otherwise,
shut the fuck up.

39:50.489 --> 39:54.292
**

39:54.392 --> 39:55.627
(notes play)

39:55.727 --> 39:59.665
(breathing heavily)

39:59.765 --> 40:01.399
This is a baton.

40:01.500 --> 40:04.770
For your purposes,
it's probably not ideal.

40:04.870 --> 40:07.072
People will identify it
as a weapon right away.

40:07.172 --> 40:09.608
That can be a problem
down the road.

40:09.708 --> 40:14.145
Your best offense --
look around.

40:14.245 --> 40:15.914
That doorstop,
straight to the temple.

40:16.014 --> 40:18.149
Base of that lamp,
shot to the kidneys.

40:18.249 --> 40:22.320
This drawer pull over here,
great for a jab to the eye.

40:22.420 --> 40:27.826
**

40:27.926 --> 40:30.629
Anything can be a weapon.

40:30.729 --> 40:32.931
**

40:33.031 --> 40:34.365
(indistinct conversations)

40:34.466 --> 40:38.036
HYNES: We get lucky
and Ronny's alibi holds up

40:38.136 --> 40:40.138
and Lambert can put Winter
at the scene,

40:40.238 --> 40:41.439
it's only a matter of time

40:41.540 --> 40:43.942
before the shit heel
is behind bars.

40:44.042 --> 40:46.678
(glasses clinking)
(upbeat music plays on stereo)

40:46.778 --> 40:49.047
Which is good.

40:49.147 --> 40:50.782
(music continues)

40:50.882 --> 40:53.952
What's the matter with you?

40:54.052 --> 40:57.022
(conversations continue)

40:57.122 --> 40:58.524
I don't know.
I'm...

40:58.624 --> 41:00.058
(breathes sharply)

41:00.158 --> 41:02.460
I'm just starting to wonder
if that's...

41:02.561 --> 41:05.531
where Winter
ought to be.

41:05.631 --> 41:06.998
I mean, he is --

41:07.098 --> 41:08.233
you know,
he's a monster,

41:08.333 --> 41:12.804
but he's also
a deeply disturbed man.

41:12.904 --> 41:15.507
Aren't we all?

41:15.607 --> 41:17.509
Locking up the mentally ill

41:17.609 --> 41:19.678
goes against
my professional principles.

41:19.778 --> 41:24.382
Well, having him committed
goes against mine.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.885
D: Don't get excited,
but the waitress

41:26.985 --> 41:31.857
described the wing sauce
as "mischievous."

41:31.957 --> 41:34.492
Hey, D, what did you take?
Winter said --

41:34.593 --> 41:37.328
Winter said you took
something important.

41:37.428 --> 41:39.531
A rock.

41:39.631 --> 41:43.034
You took a ro--
That's what you took? A rock?

41:43.134 --> 41:45.103
HYNES:
What kind of rock?

41:45.203 --> 41:46.705
You tell me.

41:46.805 --> 41:48.840
(music continues)

41:48.940 --> 41:50.408
(conversations continue)

41:50.508 --> 41:52.711
W-Why did you take this?

41:52.811 --> 41:54.780
It was
prominently displayed.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.916
(music continues)

41:59.517 --> 42:02.721
By the way, he thinks
you're the one who broke in.

42:04.455 --> 42:06.692
Bury the lead,
why don't you?

42:06.792 --> 42:09.360
He mentioned me by name?
Yep.

42:09.460 --> 42:11.396
He also thinks you're the one
who choked him out.

42:11.496 --> 42:12.698
Get ready
for the fallout.

42:12.798 --> 42:15.634
What's one step down
from Fremont PD?

42:15.734 --> 42:16.702
Mall cop?

42:16.802 --> 42:17.903
(sighs)

42:18.003 --> 42:21.272
Did he, uh,
happen to say anything else?

42:21.372 --> 42:22.373
Yeah,
he told me a story.

42:22.473 --> 42:25.777
When he was a kid,
he was on a railway platform.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.646
He saw a woman --

42:27.746 --> 42:29.380
(music continues)

42:30.582 --> 42:33.484
He saw a woman
throw a young boy

42:33.585 --> 42:36.054
onto the tracks
in front of an oncoming train.

42:36.154 --> 42:37.555
(scoffs)

42:37.656 --> 42:41.793
Do you think that's real --
the train story?

42:41.893 --> 42:43.128
I don't know.

42:43.228 --> 42:45.731
He cried on my shoulder.

42:45.831 --> 42:47.432
Oh, Jesus Christ.

42:47.532 --> 42:49.134
(dart board thuds)
(women cheer)

42:49.234 --> 42:50.468
CHANCE: He said it happened
in Emeryville.

42:50.568 --> 42:53.338
Got to be
more than one of those.

42:53.438 --> 42:54.740
How many of them
have train stations?

42:54.840 --> 42:56.341
(clears throat)

42:56.441 --> 42:59.077
If it'll make you happy,
I can look into it.

42:59.177 --> 43:01.446
If that woman was arrested,
there --

43:01.546 --> 43:04.683
there'll be records
of that.

43:04.783 --> 43:06.952
RONNY:
They ain't got dick, man.

43:07.052 --> 43:08.954
They had to let me walk.

43:09.054 --> 43:10.856
No, I'm staying
at my mom's place.

43:10.956 --> 43:12.958
(exhales sharply)
Yeah.

43:13.058 --> 43:15.994
Social Services is coming
tomorrow to check on the kids.
(door opens)

43:16.094 --> 43:18.129
Yeah, they --

43:19.931 --> 43:21.132
(lighter clicks)

43:21.232 --> 43:24.803
Yeah, um...
Mm.

43:24.903 --> 43:28.039
As long as I get to see them,
dude, that's what's --

43:29.841 --> 43:32.878
**

43:32.978 --> 43:36.882
Um...hold on, man.

43:36.982 --> 43:38.049
**

43:38.149 --> 43:39.184
No, no, no, no, no.

43:39.284 --> 43:40.618
I'm gonna call you back.

43:40.719 --> 43:42.287
Yeah,
I'm gonna call you back, man.

43:42.387 --> 43:43.789
(grunts)

43:43.889 --> 43:48.694
(screaming)

43:48.794 --> 43:50.495
(loud thud,
screaming stops)

43:50.595 --> 43:54.365
**

43:57.703 --> 43:59.170
**

43:59.270 --> 44:01.539
CHANCE:
What are you talking about?

44:01.639 --> 44:03.875
It was the middle of the day.

44:03.975 --> 44:06.011
There are no witnesses?
HYNES: None.

44:06.111 --> 44:09.180
That's why it's easy for them
to call it a suicide.

44:09.280 --> 44:10.181
One thing for sure

44:11.182 --> 44:14.552
is SFPD is gonna say
Josefa's case is now open,

44:14.652 --> 44:15.721
but solved.

44:15.821 --> 44:18.256
Solved?
That is fucking bullshit.

44:18.356 --> 44:19.324
**

44:19.424 --> 44:20.525
What they mean
is they have a guy,

44:21.760 --> 44:23.494
and they don't need to waste
any more tax dollars looking.

44:23.594 --> 44:25.430
And Winter is off the hook
again.

44:25.530 --> 44:28.566
Welcome
to my fucking world.

44:28.666 --> 44:30.435
**

44:30.535 --> 44:32.070
(sighs)

44:32.170 --> 44:35.173
(gate whirring)

44:37.776 --> 44:40.278
(birds chirping)

44:40.378 --> 44:42.613
(whirring continues)

45:05.270 --> 45:08.639
It really freaked him out,
what you did.

45:10.108 --> 45:12.443
I talked him down.

45:12.543 --> 45:13.979
He couldn't explain
why all of a sudden

45:14.079 --> 45:16.114
I was moving
all of his shit around.

45:16.214 --> 45:18.784
(vehicle passes)

45:18.884 --> 45:20.451
Can you?

45:22.653 --> 45:23.922
Look,
I don't give a shit,

45:24.022 --> 45:25.791
but I can't lose
this job.

45:25.891 --> 45:27.258
I'm the only one
that's gonna be around

45:27.358 --> 45:28.994
to take care
of this kid.

45:29.094 --> 45:30.762
(dog barking in distance)

45:30.862 --> 45:34.132
Just don't do it again.

45:37.002 --> 45:40.305
In case you get hungry.

45:40.405 --> 45:42.640
Hope you like mustard.

45:42.740 --> 45:44.142
Hey.

45:44.242 --> 45:48.613
Why didn't you scream
when you saw me in the house?

45:50.348 --> 45:52.583
'Cause you're not scary.

45:53.919 --> 45:56.687
(footsteps)

45:56.788 --> 45:58.323
(door opens)

45:58.423 --> 46:01.026
KIRSTEN: Memorial for Josefa
will be held tomorrow.

46:01.126 --> 46:02.794
I know not all of you
knew her,

46:02.894 --> 46:05.030
but it would send
a strong message of support

46:05.130 --> 46:07.632
if you could get as many staff
members as possible

46:07.732 --> 46:09.200
to the services.

46:09.300 --> 46:10.701
Also, it would be nice

46:10.802 --> 46:13.872
if we could set up a fund
for Josefa's children.

46:13.972 --> 46:17.642
And finally,
I just spoke with SFPD,

46:17.742 --> 46:19.477
and the rumors are true --

46:19.577 --> 46:23.148
Apparently, her husband
committed suicide today.

46:23.248 --> 46:24.715
Though it might sound
like justice...

46:24.816 --> 46:26.351
What's going on?

46:26.451 --> 46:27.886
...it's simply
more violence.

46:27.986 --> 46:31.890
Maybe read a memo
once in a while.

46:31.990 --> 46:33.058
You could've had cake.

46:33.158 --> 46:35.126
For what?

46:35.226 --> 46:39.230
Ryan Winter just donated
$1 million to the unit...

46:39.330 --> 46:42.000
in Josefa's name.

46:42.100 --> 46:44.402
**

46:44.502 --> 46:46.637
Jesus.

46:46.737 --> 46:49.640
(indistinct conversations)

46:49.740 --> 46:54.812
**

46:54.913 --> 46:59.017
KIRSTEN: We're all too familiar
with violence here.

46:59.117 --> 47:00.886
Josefa struggled with it daily.

47:00.986 --> 47:02.820
**

47:02.921 --> 47:06.892
The fact that she was making
such great progress

47:06.992 --> 47:09.727
only to fall victim
once again

47:09.827 --> 47:12.864
makes it
all the more devastating.

47:12.964 --> 47:16.001
To lose Josefa,
especially in this way,

47:16.101 --> 47:19.270
is traumatic for us all.

47:19.370 --> 47:20.738
Here, we try to find safety
in each other

47:20.838 --> 47:24.175
as a first step
in finding safety in the world.

47:24.275 --> 47:25.877
Hey, take a bow.

47:25.977 --> 47:28.579
Your good work
made this happen.

47:28.679 --> 47:32.783
**

47:32.884 --> 47:35.887
(quiet laughter)

47:35.987 --> 47:40.858
**

47:40.959 --> 47:42.093
(chuckles)

47:42.193 --> 47:44.029
(chuckles)

47:44.129 --> 47:47.432
**

47:47.532 --> 47:49.767
Luckily,
there are people out there,

47:49.867 --> 47:51.236
like Mr. Winter,

47:51.336 --> 47:53.238
who make it possible
for us to heal those in need

47:53.338 --> 47:57.108
through their generosity.

47:57.208 --> 48:01.479
I know
this is a time for grief,

48:01.579 --> 48:05.316
but on behalf of Josefa,
I'd like to thank you.

48:05.416 --> 48:07.752
(applause)

48:07.852 --> 48:09.620
**

48:09.720 --> 48:16.227
**

48:16.327 --> 48:18.763
(chuckles)

48:18.863 --> 48:21.399
**

48:21.499 --> 48:22.633
-Oh.
-Oh!

48:22.733 --> 48:24.936
(whimpers)

48:25.036 --> 48:27.105
Thank you.

48:27.205 --> 48:31.742
**

48:31.842 --> 48:35.746
(high-pitched ringing)

48:35.846 --> 48:39.484
**

48:42.853 --> 48:44.155
**

48:44.255 --> 48:47.425
* None of us seems fine

48:47.525 --> 48:49.927
**

48:50.028 --> 48:54.932
* None of us is good

48:55.033 --> 48:57.435
**

48:57.535 --> 48:59.937
* Most of us are nice

49:00.038 --> 49:03.708
**

49:03.808 --> 49:09.981
* When we feel
we really should be *

49:10.081 --> 49:11.216
**

49:11.316 --> 49:14.986
* Nice won't get us far

49:15.086 --> 49:17.488
**

49:17.588 --> 49:22.493
* 'Cause none of us is fine

49:22.593 --> 49:23.661
**

49:23.761 --> 49:26.231
* None of us is fine

49:26.331 --> 49:30.468
* 'Cause none of us is fine

49:30.568 --> 49:32.470
**

49:32.570 --> 49:36.474
* None of us is fine
