00:09.064 --> 00:12.192
Good morning,
Mr. And Ms. School-Age America.

00:12.234 --> 00:14.702
It's time to put your lunch pail
in your cubby...

00:14.737 --> 00:17.035
and punch the clock,
because you're about to start...

00:17.072 --> 00:20.701
the first day of your career in science!

00:22.378 --> 00:25.245
Meet your new boss, Dr. Jonas Venture.

00:25.281 --> 00:28.739
Famed inventor, philanthropist,
and globe-trotting adventurer.

00:30.786 --> 00:34.347
Now enter your new office,
Gargantua-1...

00:34.390 --> 00:37.382
a space station so advanced,
so self-sufficient...

00:37.426 --> 00:40.589
that it has been dubbed
"the ninth wonder of the world."

00:42.097 --> 00:48.058
Here, you and over 2,000 other employees,
including 200 space welders...

00:48.103 --> 00:51.561
74 flying nurses, and one busy barber...

00:51.607 --> 00:55.771
labor to make the boss' perfect vision
a perfect reality.

00:57.479 --> 01:02.280
Why, even little Rusty,
Dr. Venture's companion and son...

01:02.318 --> 01:04.183
is pitching in.

01:04.218 --> 01:09.350
Yes, it looks like Rusty's career in science
has a bright future.

01:24.807 --> 01:25.967
- Wuss!
- Knock it off!

01:30.579 --> 01:32.069
Boys, for the last time, stop!

01:32.114 --> 01:33.877
Brock is trying to drive!

01:33.916 --> 01:36.009
- I'm cool.
- He started it!

01:36.051 --> 01:39.043
No, I started it years ago
in a moment of passion...

01:39.088 --> 01:44.116
and I'll end it the same way right here
in front of Brock, H.E.L.P.eR., and God!

01:44.159 --> 01:47.890
Now sit on your hands
and keep your mouths shut!

01:50.099 --> 01:54.058
But now I can't read
my Giant Boy Detective book.

01:54.103 --> 01:56.230
Shouldn't be reading
in a moving vehicle, anyway.

01:56.271 --> 01:57.898
You know it makes you...

02:56.231 --> 02:59.223
Good morning, Vent Shuttle Two.
This is control.

02:59.268 --> 03:01.634
Maintain present course
and enjoy the view.

03:01.670 --> 03:06.164
And may I state what an honor it is
to have the illustrious Dr. Venture...

03:08.277 --> 03:09.437
Hello?

03:09.478 --> 03:12.174
Should I hold down the little button?

03:12.214 --> 03:13.408
Thank you, Control.

03:13.449 --> 03:15.974
Vent Shuttle Two ready to receive
docking protocol.

03:16.018 --> 03:17.713
And roger that.

03:17.753 --> 03:21.189
I'll leave you in the hands
of Lieutenant Baldavich for that procedure.

03:21.223 --> 03:23.054
Welcome home.

03:23.092 --> 03:27.085
Let's take this slow. It's my first time.

03:27.129 --> 03:28.528
I'll be gentle.

03:28.564 --> 03:30.361
Now, where do you want this hot rocket?

03:30.399 --> 03:33.596
Wow, that's a big one!

03:33.635 --> 03:36.365
Now, ease it in.

03:36.405 --> 03:37.770
Good.

03:39.241 --> 03:40.708
Just like that.

03:40.743 --> 03:42.802
Brock, could we speed this up?

03:42.845 --> 03:44.710
I really have to go number one.
I'm serious.

03:44.747 --> 03:46.874
That's it, keep going.

03:46.915 --> 03:49.475
Slow, slow.

03:49.518 --> 03:51.816
Yes, that's it!

03:51.854 --> 03:53.549
That's a tight fit.

03:53.589 --> 03:57.184
It's like they were made for each other.

03:57.226 --> 03:59.717
That's because they were, because they
were both made by the same guy.

03:59.762 --> 04:01.559
Now, can we finish this up, please?

04:01.597 --> 04:06.125
I'm almost there.
Brace yourself, 'cause it's gonna be...

04:06.168 --> 04:08.033
Oh, come on!

04:19.314 --> 04:21.714
Dr. Venture, I presume?

04:21.750 --> 04:24.014
I wish.

04:24.052 --> 04:25.542
That's my man, Brock.

04:27.489 --> 04:29.548
This is quite an honor, Dr. Venture.

04:29.591 --> 04:33.618
I'm Colonel Bud Manstrong,
and this vision is Anna Bal...

04:33.662 --> 04:35.960
I mean, Lieutenant Baldavich.

04:35.998 --> 04:38.125
Great. Look, is there some kind
of bathroom you could...

04:39.735 --> 04:41.930
Of course, how insensitive of me.

04:41.970 --> 04:46.430
You've had a long journey,
and I'm sure you need to unpack your...

04:46.475 --> 04:49.342
extra liquid.

04:49.378 --> 04:51.403
All right, fine.
Let's just get going.

04:51.446 --> 04:53.539
OK, I like that.

04:53.582 --> 04:55.049
Let's get to work.

04:55.083 --> 04:57.074
This way, gentlemen.

05:01.423 --> 05:05.052
Those sure are dandy-fine space suits
you boys got.

05:05.093 --> 05:07.254
It's kinda creepy in here.

05:07.296 --> 05:08.923
And cold.

05:08.964 --> 05:13.333
When it gets cold like this,
I always remember back when I was a...

05:13.368 --> 05:16.098
paperboy on this station.

05:16.138 --> 05:19.437
I must have been about your age,
and on a night just like this...

05:19.474 --> 05:21.135
one of the crew just suddenly...

05:21.176 --> 05:22.336
cracked.

05:22.377 --> 05:24.004
Cool!

05:24.046 --> 05:28.642
He gathered everyone in the hangar
for what he called "movie night."

05:28.684 --> 05:32.950
And under the flickering light
of Burt Reynolds' "Sharky's Machine"...

05:32.988 --> 05:35.616
he opened the bay doors.

05:35.657 --> 05:39.616
Almost the whole crew was there,
"Sharky's Machine."

05:41.330 --> 05:46.199
Yep, they say his phantom spirit
still roams these corridors.

05:46.235 --> 05:48.703
Phantom space man!

05:48.737 --> 05:50.534
Right, Dr. Venture?

05:51.707 --> 05:53.368
Whatever.
Look, I'm gonna be honest here.

05:53.408 --> 05:55.205
I really need to take a tinkle.

05:59.648 --> 06:00.808
We're here.

06:00.849 --> 06:03.079
So, what's the problem?

06:03.118 --> 06:04.312
The light went on.

06:04.353 --> 06:05.980
That's helpful.

06:06.021 --> 06:08.216
And that's never happened before.

06:08.257 --> 06:11.226
And then we found this.
So, we called you.

06:11.260 --> 06:15.356
Thought the brainiac son of Dr. Venture
could lick this in a jiffy.

06:15.397 --> 06:16.921
Stand back, everyone!

06:16.965 --> 06:19.092
Let the genius put on the ol' thinking cap.

06:19.134 --> 06:20.965
Flattery will get you everywhere.

06:24.473 --> 06:26.839
- Doc, you OK?
- Yeah! I'm fine.

06:26.875 --> 06:29.844
I was just enjoying
the super freedom of space travel.

06:29.878 --> 06:32.676
You know, testing out
the waste collection pouch.

06:32.714 --> 06:35.512
It really is quite liberating.

06:37.052 --> 06:39.282
What? We're astronauts.

06:39.321 --> 06:41.186
Why is everyone...

06:41.223 --> 06:42.918
isn't there something we should be doing?

06:42.958 --> 06:44.516
You heard the man!

06:44.559 --> 06:48.222
Let's scrub this baby down
and give her a good powdering.

06:49.364 --> 06:52.561
Oh, sweet mercy, tell me these suits
have a collection pouch.

06:53.969 --> 06:55.368
It's still on!

06:55.404 --> 06:56.701
Hold on, boys.

06:56.738 --> 06:58.467
Brock! Come in, Brock!

06:58.507 --> 07:00.031
Yeah, what?

07:00.075 --> 07:03.602
How is the cargo bay? Is it broken?

07:03.645 --> 07:05.636
This is a huge waste of time.

07:05.681 --> 07:07.512
These panels have never been opened.

07:08.650 --> 07:12.313
The whole place smells like a new radio.

07:12.354 --> 07:14.914
Fine, just keep checking.

07:16.358 --> 07:17.757
Anything?

07:17.793 --> 07:19.761
No, it's still on.

07:19.795 --> 07:22.992
Do these switches even do anything?
What about now?

07:23.031 --> 07:25.329
It's... wait. Wait, it's...

07:25.367 --> 07:27.597
On or off?

07:27.636 --> 07:29.501
It's still on.

07:32.708 --> 07:33.902
Anna.

07:33.942 --> 07:38.879
Maybe I'm just a romantic fool spurred on
by the friscalating starlight...

07:38.914 --> 07:40.575
but I phoned Mother about us.

07:40.615 --> 07:42.947
I think I may be ready to...

07:42.985 --> 07:44.509
I mean...

07:44.553 --> 07:46.544
I don't want to rush you into anything.

07:46.588 --> 07:50.684
Rush me? We've been alone
on this station for six years!

07:50.726 --> 07:54.856
Six years of hand-holding,
six years of kisses on cheek,

07:54.896 --> 07:56.295
of love notes in locker...

07:56.331 --> 07:59.698
of "I heart Anna"
with that little "T.L.A." thing...

07:59.735 --> 08:01.464
drawn on space boot with Sharpie.

08:01.503 --> 08:04.666
What more could a girl want?

08:04.706 --> 08:07.402
- Now?
- Still on.

08:07.442 --> 08:10.070
A problem light. Wow, Dad.
What a super idea!

08:10.112 --> 08:13.479
No, you should always put one of those
on the ninth wonder of the world.

08:13.515 --> 08:15.142
- Anything?
- No.

08:15.183 --> 08:17.174
Now?

08:19.821 --> 08:23.552
What I'm going to ask you
is no small step forward for us.

08:23.592 --> 08:27.961
It's one giant step forward for us-kind.

08:27.996 --> 08:34.128
So, I need to know now if there's
any reason you would not want...

08:35.169 --> 08:36.865
Brock!

08:47.849 --> 08:52.513
You won't get off
this easy, Brock Samson.

08:52.554 --> 08:53.816
- It's on.
- It's off.

08:59.394 --> 09:01.589
That's called blinking, boys.

09:02.631 --> 09:05.099
- Anything?
- Now it's just regular on.

09:06.601 --> 09:08.398
Why don't you boys
go help someone else?

09:08.437 --> 09:10.701
Or better,
get me a dry space suit.

09:10.739 --> 09:12.604
Your father's basting in his own juices.

09:14.409 --> 09:16.570
Oh, it got in my gloves.

09:18.113 --> 09:19.341
Oh, dear God.

09:26.354 --> 09:28.049
Great design, Dad.

09:28.090 --> 09:29.887
What a super place
for the gravity button.

09:37.065 --> 09:39.863
Our dad wants a dry space suit.

09:41.069 --> 09:44.232
- What happened?
- Someone opened the bay doors on him.

09:44.272 --> 09:47.036
He should be dead.

09:47.075 --> 09:48.508
Phantom space man!

09:48.543 --> 09:50.909
We gotta warn Dad!

09:54.216 --> 09:56.207
Gonna lie down for a sec.

10:01.857 --> 10:03.290
Too late.

10:03.325 --> 10:05.384
Is he dead?

10:05.427 --> 10:07.759
Can't tell.
Touch his neck.

10:07.796 --> 10:09.957
- You.
- No, I don't wanna.

10:11.133 --> 10:13.863
Holy crap, I think he's really dead!

10:13.902 --> 10:16.166
Why would the phantom space man guy
do this?

10:27.682 --> 10:31.118
Hello, Rusty!
It's time to get up.

10:31.153 --> 10:33.451
Dad?

10:33.488 --> 10:36.355
I think I peed my bed.

10:45.600 --> 10:46.760
Let's go, boy!

10:46.801 --> 10:48.769
That pterodactyl looks mighty hungry!

10:48.803 --> 10:51.135
And I do believe we're on the menu!

10:52.173 --> 10:53.970
Should I hide in a barrel or something?

10:54.009 --> 10:56.807
Hang on, son!
These savages mean business!

10:56.845 --> 10:58.813
Now, grab my hand and hold on tight!

11:00.015 --> 11:01.812
Of course.

11:01.850 --> 11:03.477
Am I a ghost?

11:03.518 --> 11:06.385
Yeah, that's it.

11:06.421 --> 11:10.016
I have come here to show you
the folly of your ways!

11:10.058 --> 11:12.390
Take my hand, and we'll travel to...

11:12.427 --> 11:14.224
Come on, Dad!

11:14.262 --> 11:16.958
One, we just proved nobody's
taking anybody's hand here.

11:16.998 --> 11:20.297
And two, you never believed in ghosts.
You were a scientist.

11:20.335 --> 11:24.032
Yeah, that's true. I guess.

11:24.072 --> 11:27.530
I whacked my head
trying to fix your stupid space station.

11:27.575 --> 11:32.444
It's clear you're a traumatic hallucination
made manifest by my hitting my... ego.

11:32.480 --> 11:33.879
All right, fine, fine.

11:33.915 --> 11:35.815
But I'm still your father.

11:35.850 --> 11:39.445
What did you do to my space station?

11:41.756 --> 11:44.190
Stop! I'm gonna throw up!

11:44.225 --> 11:45.419
What do we do?

11:45.460 --> 11:47.325
We should look for clues or something.

11:47.362 --> 11:49.762
Now, what would Giant Boy Detective do?

11:50.865 --> 11:52.560
Screw Giant Boy Detective!

11:52.600 --> 11:54.693
His dad's not dead!

11:54.736 --> 11:56.670
That was mine.

11:57.739 --> 11:59.969
This wasn't supposed to happen!

12:00.008 --> 12:01.999
I hate Phantom Space Man!

12:03.545 --> 12:07.675
Oh, my God, why can't you
take the responsibility of your failure?

12:07.716 --> 12:11.914
Because Gargantua-1 is perfect! The
problem has to be your fault.

12:11.953 --> 12:14.148
My fault? "Gargantua-1!"

12:14.189 --> 12:16.589
It's like the worst name
for a space station.

12:16.624 --> 12:20.390
- I thought it cool.
- No, I thought you thought it was cool.

12:22.564 --> 12:26.056
OK, crazy, then by your logic,
you think you broke my space station.

12:29.070 --> 12:31.834
- I've tried everything.
- Are you kidding me?

12:31.873 --> 12:35.866
You were just flipping switches.
Think, think, tiny wonder!

12:35.910 --> 12:38.902
You built this with me,
you should know her inside and out.

12:38.947 --> 12:40.107
I was, like, ten.

12:40.148 --> 12:42.844
I just wanted to play with
my plastic cowboys and Indians.

12:42.884 --> 12:45.375
Who lets a ten-year-old
build a space station?

12:47.188 --> 12:48.416
Nothing.

12:48.456 --> 12:50.390
What are you doing?

12:50.425 --> 12:53.326
Oh, hold on. I have another call.

12:57.098 --> 12:58.429
It was someone trying to fax me.

12:58.466 --> 12:59.694
Anyway...

13:07.575 --> 13:09.338
I'm never gonna get used to that.

13:09.377 --> 13:11.845
What? The pain?

13:11.880 --> 13:16.078
It would have killed a lesser man,
but you look spectacular.

13:16.117 --> 13:17.641
Oh, yeah. The pain.

13:17.685 --> 13:18.845
That's not so bad.

13:18.887 --> 13:21.014
I hacked up some blood
a couple of minutes ago.

13:21.056 --> 13:24.548
There was this big chunk
about the size of a...

13:24.592 --> 13:26.184
one of those little kiwi fruit...

13:26.227 --> 13:29.685
but I don't feel anything missing,
so I'm not too worried.

13:29.731 --> 13:33.861
You are quite a man, Brock Samson.

13:33.902 --> 13:36.928
Is there anything
I can do to help you?

13:36.971 --> 13:40.202
Yeah, you can unzip
your space suit for me.

13:40.241 --> 13:41.538
And, uh...

13:41.576 --> 13:43.476
I like it with the helmet on.

13:45.880 --> 13:48.280
Oh, crap!
The door's locked!

13:48.316 --> 13:50.216
If we can't get to Brock, we're goners!

13:50.251 --> 13:51.513
No, wait!

13:51.553 --> 13:52.713
I see him!

13:52.754 --> 13:54.585
And it looks like he's wrestling someone!

13:54.622 --> 13:55.782
Shove over!

13:57.759 --> 13:59.659
Phantom Space Man!

14:01.596 --> 14:03.587
That's it, Brock.
Pace yourself.

14:03.631 --> 14:05.030
Conserve your energy.

14:05.066 --> 14:06.363
What the...

14:06.401 --> 14:07.561
What's he doing with his...

14:07.602 --> 14:08.830
Think about it, bro.

14:08.870 --> 14:10.428
What other weapon does he have?

14:10.472 --> 14:13.066
He needs his hands free... for stuff.

14:13.108 --> 14:16.566
Phantom Space Man
somehow got on top!

14:16.611 --> 14:18.602
That's it, Brocko.
Shake him off!

14:22.183 --> 14:23.377
He's got him on his knees!

14:23.418 --> 14:24.942
Just a matter of time now.

14:24.986 --> 14:26.453
Brock is just toying with him!

14:26.488 --> 14:28.786
Whoa! Pretzel bender!

14:28.823 --> 14:31.690
Brock's gotta teach me that one.

14:31.726 --> 14:34.524
Phantom Space Man got
his helmet knocked off!

14:34.562 --> 14:36.689
Oh, my God, he's hideous!

14:36.731 --> 14:39.325
Must have been deformed by space rays.

14:39.367 --> 14:40.527
Look again, Hank!

14:40.568 --> 14:44.766
That's not a phantom space man,
that's Lieutenant Baldavich!

14:45.907 --> 14:47.966
- That means...
- Right?

14:48.009 --> 14:52.139
Phantom Space Man...
is still on the loose!

15:04.492 --> 15:06.824
Oh, great, Dad.
Now it's blinking again.

15:06.861 --> 15:09.295
How this thing didn't follow Skylab down,
I'll never know.

15:09.330 --> 15:12.663
Looks like something pierced the hull.
Super-good!

15:12.700 --> 15:15.692
Hey... My diet pills!
Where are my diet pills?

15:15.737 --> 15:18.831
Oh, Rusty,
you don't need diet pills!

15:18.873 --> 15:21.171
You just need to work a few things out.

15:21.209 --> 15:23.473
Look who's telling me
this, my dead, twelve-foot-tall father.

15:24.879 --> 15:27.780
I thought I built
a bigger space station than this.

15:27.815 --> 15:30.283
I guess I remember you
always towering over me.

15:31.486 --> 15:33.420
There you are, you little bugger!

15:33.454 --> 15:38.482
Lad, remember,
the solution was in you all the time.

15:38.526 --> 15:41.552
- All you have to do is...
- Bye, Dad.

15:44.699 --> 15:46.462
Well, what does it matter anymore?

15:46.501 --> 15:47.866
Dad's dead!

15:47.902 --> 15:52.532
Just because some Phantom Space Man
had to come here and ruin everything!

15:52.574 --> 15:55.236
What did dad ever do
to Phantom Space Man?

15:56.644 --> 15:59.613
Phantom Space Man's a big, fat jerk!

16:02.784 --> 16:04.445
Phantom Space Man!

16:05.687 --> 16:06.881
- I'm gonna kill you!
- Why?

16:08.756 --> 16:10.223
How could you do this?

16:10.258 --> 16:11.555
You... good for...

16:11.593 --> 16:14.118
We're alone! No!

16:14.162 --> 16:15.857
Kill! Vengeance!

16:15.897 --> 16:17.159
- For what?
- Brock!

16:17.198 --> 16:19.496
- Dear God!
- Freak!

16:19.534 --> 16:23.163
Take it! Die! Die! Die!

16:27.175 --> 16:29.143
So... how was he?

16:29.177 --> 16:31.645
- How was who?
- Aw, come on!

16:31.679 --> 16:34.341
I shook his hand!
It's all fat and stubby!

16:34.382 --> 16:37.317
He must have, like, a huge mushroom
down there!

16:37.352 --> 16:40.549
So, does he have a smurf
living in it or what?

16:40.588 --> 16:43.250
- What's gotten into you?
- Got into me?

16:43.291 --> 16:45.350
I know what got into you!

16:45.393 --> 16:47.258
And that's what got into me!

16:47.295 --> 16:49.024
You don't deserve to be jealous!

16:49.063 --> 16:51.258
I gave you every chance in the world!

16:51.299 --> 16:53.392
I'm not jealous! I'm pissed!

16:53.434 --> 16:55.197
You said you were gonna wait till...

16:55.236 --> 16:57.568
No! You said we were gonna wait!

16:57.605 --> 16:59.539
I don't have to take this.

17:01.943 --> 17:04.104
That's because you already took it.

17:04.145 --> 17:05.305
In the...

17:05.346 --> 17:06.744
lap!

17:06.781 --> 17:07.941
From...

17:07.982 --> 17:10.176
not me!

17:16.691 --> 17:19.558
Go, Team Venture.

17:21.863 --> 17:24.161
Attention! There has been a hull breach!

17:24.198 --> 17:25.790
That's Pop! He's alive!

17:25.833 --> 17:27.232
- Danger!
- Daddy?

17:27.268 --> 17:29.168
Brock, come to the bridge immediately!

17:29.203 --> 17:30.363
Pelligro!

17:30.405 --> 17:33.806
I am now repeating,
there has been a hull breach!

17:33.841 --> 17:36.275
This is serious!

17:38.579 --> 17:40.570
Now, what do we have here?

17:42.216 --> 17:43.444
What is this, Tang?

17:45.720 --> 17:47.688
They still smell of my salty leavings.

17:47.722 --> 17:49.019
- Doc?
- What?

17:49.057 --> 17:50.922
Where have you been all day?

17:50.958 --> 17:53.256
There was a little accident in the cargo bay.

17:53.294 --> 17:55.785
No matter. I need you to get
suited up and repair a hole...

17:55.830 --> 17:58.162
in this hunk of junk
my dad left to the world.

17:58.199 --> 18:00.326
- Yeah, OK, fine.
- I'm going with him.

18:01.936 --> 18:03.631
It could be...

18:03.671 --> 18:05.798
dangerous out there.

18:05.840 --> 18:07.831
Great.

18:10.812 --> 18:13.110
Oh, fine, Dad.
Blame me.

18:13.147 --> 18:14.637
Blame Rusty.

18:14.682 --> 18:16.946
But who's fault is this?

18:19.120 --> 18:21.111
Oh, God, it's mine.

18:32.734 --> 18:36.033
Sir, you have plucked the flower
of the woman I love.

18:36.070 --> 18:38.868
I trust you will do
the right and noble thing.

18:38.906 --> 18:40.931
She will make a fine wife.

18:40.975 --> 18:44.672
Her father invented the "Mr. Mouth" game,
so she's an heiress.

18:44.712 --> 18:47.613
You two should be quite comfortable.

18:47.648 --> 18:50.014
It's really my fault.

18:50.051 --> 18:53.851
I should have been more attentive to her...

18:53.888 --> 18:57.688
carnal needs,
but to be fair, I must warn you...

18:57.725 --> 19:02.185
if you harm a hair
on her sweet little head, I will...

19:05.933 --> 19:07.525
No, wait!

19:09.404 --> 19:11.167
How inappropriate!

19:11.205 --> 19:13.969
Don't do...

19:14.008 --> 19:16.033
Wait! Stop! Look!

19:35.930 --> 19:37.192
I fixed it!

19:37.231 --> 19:38.391
- Dad!
- Daddy!

19:38.433 --> 19:39.627
- We thought you were dead!
- You're alive!

19:39.667 --> 19:41.635
OK, boys.
Let's take it easy.

19:41.669 --> 19:44.695
See, crybaby?
Told you he was alive.

19:44.739 --> 19:48.072
Oh, man!
What is it like to be such a huge liar, huh?

19:48.109 --> 19:51.272
"I'm all super-scared
of Phantom Space Man!"

19:51.312 --> 19:52.506
Oh, that's it, bookworm!

19:56.384 --> 19:57.578
Oh, fantastic.

19:57.618 --> 20:01.179
I'll just slip into this little number,
and we can get out of here.

20:01.222 --> 20:04.316
No need to say good-bye.
I'll let them thank me later.

20:08.296 --> 20:10.423
Good Lord, what are you waiting for?

20:10.465 --> 20:11.659
Let me in!

20:11.699 --> 20:13.633
Not until you apologize.

20:13.668 --> 20:18.264
Oh, you're kidding me!
I can't feel my right side!

20:18.306 --> 20:22.367
I'm going to die out here!

20:22.410 --> 20:24.708
I'm waiting.

21:29.510 --> 21:32.240
That's good soup.
