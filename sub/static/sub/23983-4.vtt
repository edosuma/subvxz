00:00.320 --> 00:03.034
Vincent, Matthew, thank you
so much for coming in

00:03.044 --> 00:05.177
- on such short notice.
- Let me stop you right there.

00:05.187 --> 00:06.804
We know why you called us in.

00:06.814 --> 00:08.929
This is a fancy-shmancy school,

00:08.940 --> 00:11.407
and tuition alone isn't gonna keep Daddy

00:11.409 --> 00:12.909
in his wood-paneled office.

00:12.911 --> 00:15.211
No, this isn't a meeting.
It's a shakedown.

00:15.213 --> 00:17.880
Yeah, well, joke's on you
'cause we don't have any money.

00:17.882 --> 00:19.415
- Nope.
- What's up?

00:19.417 --> 00:20.650
I know.

00:20.652 --> 00:22.385
Your son's on a full scholarship,

00:22.387 --> 00:24.754
and you steal toilet paper
every time you come here.

00:27.325 --> 00:28.558
Thanks.

00:28.560 --> 00:31.816
The reason I called you in is because
Michael wrote an English essay

00:31.827 --> 00:33.963
that, frankly, we all found
a little troubling.

00:33.965 --> 00:38.167
The assignment was for Michael to
describe his morning routine and...

00:38.169 --> 00:41.103
You know what? Why don't you
just read it for yourselves?

00:42.155 --> 00:44.473
<i>My morning ritual by Michael Patel.</i>

00:44.475 --> 00:46.108
<i>Each morning begins the same.</i>

00:46.110 --> 00:47.877
<i>First, I take in the headlines</i>

00:47.879 --> 00:50.012
<i>from my most trusted
news source... Snapchat.</i>

00:50.014 --> 00:52.248
<i>Second, I tweet "good morning"
at Rihanna.</i>

00:52.250 --> 00:54.951
<i>And, finally, I wait to see
what kind of woman my father,</i>

00:54.953 --> 00:56.953
<i>Vince, brought home the night before.</i>

00:56.955 --> 00:59.055
<i>I've never met so many
different kinds of women...</i>

00:59.057 --> 01:02.291
<i>bartenders, meter maids,
frozen-yogurt cashiers,</i>

01:02.293 --> 01:05.061
<i>even an antelope from "Lion King."</i>

01:09.288 --> 01:11.894
<i>Each morning is like a new
episode of "The Bachelor,"</i>

01:11.905 --> 01:14.036
<i>except Vince likes diversity.</i>

01:14.038 --> 01:17.807
Okay, so what's the problem?
I come off pretty good in that.

01:17.809 --> 01:20.242
I think what w... what we're
concerned about

01:20.244 --> 01:22.712
is one of our students
being exposed to such a display

01:22.714 --> 01:24.547
of wanton sexual excess.

01:24.549 --> 01:26.215
"Sexual excess"? No, no, no.

01:26.217 --> 01:27.550
What I have are appropriate,

01:27.552 --> 01:30.486
loving relations
between two people who are

01:30.488 --> 01:32.188
on dating apps after 11:00 p.m.

01:32.190 --> 01:35.257
Dean, I am so sorry for my brother's...

01:35.259 --> 01:37.326
what is the word... horniness.

01:37.328 --> 01:39.695
I promise, as long as
Michael's living with us,

01:39.697 --> 01:41.266
- Vince and I will not date.
- Wait.

01:41.277 --> 01:42.661
Vince, let's go.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074

01:58.816 --> 02:00.783
<i>- Matthew, I agreed
to raise my son,</i>

02:00.785 --> 02:02.785
not take a vow of celibacy, okay?

02:02.787 --> 02:04.220
Nobody wants a nerd for a dad.

02:04.222 --> 02:05.988
You can't play catch with a dictionary.

02:05.990 --> 02:07.442
But Michael says Priya never dated.

02:07.453 --> 02:09.228
According to Facebook,
she's only ever been

02:09.239 --> 02:10.767
in a relationship with pizza bites.

02:10.777 --> 02:12.962
Okay, it's easier for women not to date.

02:12.964 --> 02:15.131
After they give birth,
their sexuality turns off

02:15.133 --> 02:17.493
so they can focus
on raising their offspring.

02:17.504 --> 02:19.101
Did you never listen to Dad's lectures?

02:19.103 --> 02:20.943
Oh, yeah, sure I did. He
also made us memorize

02:20.954 --> 02:22.672
which countries were sneakiest.

02:22.674 --> 02:24.473
So the lectures weren't all great.

02:24.475 --> 02:27.349
But honestly, the part that I
find most unfair about all this

02:27.360 --> 02:29.011
is that your whole life's
been a hot streak.

02:29.013 --> 02:31.414
- What are you talking about?
- Excuse me.

02:31.416 --> 02:32.802
You look tired.

02:32.813 --> 02:34.884
- Would you like my seat?
- He's fine, thank you.

02:34.886 --> 02:37.019
I wasn't talking to you, Al Franken.

02:37.021 --> 02:38.293
See?

02:38.304 --> 02:40.567
Women have thrown themselves
at you since you were born.

02:40.578 --> 02:42.958
Three different nurses tried to
steal you from the hospital.

02:42.969 --> 02:46.762
And now word's out there that I
am a single, responsible father.

02:46.764 --> 02:48.564
And I am on fire.

02:48.566 --> 02:50.232
Please do not take that from me.

02:50.234 --> 02:51.567
I'm sorry, but raising a child

02:51.569 --> 02:53.616
is gonna require sacrifices
from both of us.

02:53.627 --> 02:56.085
For instance... I don't think I'm
cultured enough for Michael.

02:56.096 --> 02:57.777
I never get any of his references,

02:57.788 --> 02:58.954
so I made flash cards.

02:58.956 --> 03:00.956
- What?
- "Fifth Harmony."

03:00.958 --> 03:03.024
"Rooney Mara."

03:03.026 --> 03:06.027
"Yaaaaaaaaaaas!"

03:06.029 --> 03:07.562
That one means "yes."

03:07.564 --> 03:10.632
As in, "Can we both stop
dating for Michael's sake?"

03:10.634 --> 03:13.668
Yaaaaaaaaaas!"

03:16.305 --> 03:18.639
Hey, just FYI,

03:18.650 --> 03:20.542
I let a guy in your office.

03:20.544 --> 03:22.811
Why did you let a guy into my office?

03:22.813 --> 03:25.313
Because he's really
good-looking and confident.

03:25.315 --> 03:26.848
Just the sort of charismatic,

03:26.850 --> 03:28.884
take-charge kind of guy
we don't have around here.

03:32.524 --> 03:34.781
- Oh, it's Ro.
- Vincent, what's up?

03:34.792 --> 03:37.092
Ruby, this is Priya's
little brother, Ro.

03:37.094 --> 03:38.460
Short for Rohit.

03:38.462 --> 03:41.129
Wow. You have great energy.

03:41.131 --> 03:42.597
Has anyone ever told you that?

03:42.599 --> 03:44.332
No, but I have been told

03:44.334 --> 03:46.501
I remind people of a wrecking ball.

03:46.503 --> 03:49.638
Man, I have never touched
such an expensive watch before.

03:49.640 --> 03:52.140
It's not my Patek Philippe,
but it suits the occasion.

03:52.142 --> 03:53.475
Yeah, I got a cool watch, too.

03:53.477 --> 03:54.876
It's a Timex.

03:54.878 --> 03:56.545
Could wear it out, wear it to work.

03:56.547 --> 03:58.013
It's water resistant up to 3 meters,

03:58.015 --> 03:59.881
so I can go swimming
with it if I wanted to.

03:59.883 --> 04:01.783
Yeah, but you'd have
to learn how to swim.

04:01.785 --> 04:04.319
This guy, terrified of water.

04:04.321 --> 04:05.887
He was sent home from summer camp

04:05.889 --> 04:07.222
'cause he wouldn't go in the lake.

04:07.233 --> 04:08.822
Yeah, you don't know
what's out there, okay?

04:08.833 --> 04:10.892
Like, what if water went up your butt.

04:10.894 --> 04:13.295
Yuck!

04:13.297 --> 04:15.130
Gah, I'm gonna go.

04:15.132 --> 04:16.363
Bye, Ro.

04:16.366 --> 04:18.266
Okay.

04:18.267 --> 04:20.051
So, Ro, how you been, buddy?

04:20.062 --> 04:21.714
I haven't talked to you
since high school,

04:21.726 --> 04:24.126
but I think Priya told me you
were a gardener or something?

04:24.137 --> 04:26.508
Not like a gardener. I run a hedge fund.

04:26.510 --> 04:28.501
I actually made so much money
I had to change citizenship.

04:28.512 --> 04:29.798
I'm from the Cayman Islands now.

04:29.809 --> 04:31.012
- That's cool.
- Oh, hey...

04:31.014 --> 04:32.881
weren't you suppose to play baseball?

04:32.883 --> 04:34.683
Um, yeah, you know, I...

04:34.685 --> 04:37.819
I mean, I-I thought about it,
but the whole MLB thing

04:37.821 --> 04:39.621
is just a little too showy for me.

04:39.623 --> 04:42.624
Right. Plus, you have to be, like,
really good at baseball to do that.

04:42.626 --> 04:44.493
- Yeah.
- Isn't it funny?

04:44.495 --> 04:46.194
Like, in some ways, I'm living the life

04:46.196 --> 04:48.230
- you were supposed have.
- I disagree, you know.

04:48.232 --> 04:50.398
- I love my life.
- Hey!

04:50.400 --> 04:54.236
You need to plunge the toilet.
People are starting to pass out.

04:55.112 --> 04:56.344
You were saying.

04:56.355 --> 04:59.010
Now that the Cooks and the
Patels are one big giant family,

04:59.021 --> 05:01.543
I thought it'd be nice if you,
Matthew, and Michael joined me

05:01.545 --> 05:03.111
at this hot, new French restaurant

05:03.113 --> 05:04.635
- that I invested in downtown...
- Okay.

05:04.646 --> 05:06.541
- L'Trine.
- That's Leonardo DiCaprio's

05:06.552 --> 05:07.883
favorite place to stumble out of.

05:07.885 --> 05:09.757
Leo's crazy, but he's such
a loyal guy, you know?

05:09.768 --> 05:11.929
It's pretty fancy, so let me
know if you need a jacket

05:11.947 --> 05:14.256
or socks or a haircut.

05:14.258 --> 05:17.192
Okay. I have a jacket.
I've been to court.

05:17.194 --> 05:18.994
But, you know, Michael just moved here.

05:18.996 --> 05:21.930
I think these are delicate times,
and I don't want to overwhelm him

05:21.932 --> 05:24.199
with random relatives
just showing up out of nowhere.

05:24.201 --> 05:26.001
Okay, I've known him
since he was a baby.

05:26.003 --> 05:28.623
If anything, you're the random
relative showing up out of nowhere.

05:28.634 --> 05:31.434
Well, it's not the quantity
of time, it's the quality.

05:32.075 --> 05:34.042
- What's his middle name?
- Um...

05:35.212 --> 05:36.878
- Mahatma.
- No, it's Prashant.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.407
Right, yes, of course. No, I know.

05:38.418 --> 05:40.326
Look, let Michael know
and let him decide.

05:40.337 --> 05:42.484
Fine, I will. Let me see you out.

05:42.486 --> 05:45.420
Okay, I don't think this place is
fancy enough to be "seen out of."

05:45.422 --> 05:47.122
I'm fine. Thanks.

05:49.860 --> 05:51.960
Hey, Dana. We're gonna need new plunger.

05:51.962 --> 05:53.862
Also, I might need a tetanus shot.

05:53.864 --> 05:55.641
The plunger's bought, and the
free clinic is expecting you.

05:55.652 --> 05:57.790
- Oh, you're reading "Gone Girl."
- Mm-hmm.

05:57.801 --> 05:59.834
Can you believe she kidnapped herself?

06:00.437 --> 06:01.770
Haven't gotten to that part yet.

06:01.772 --> 06:03.838
Oh. Huge plot twist.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.840
You're gonna love it. Thanks.

06:08.779 --> 06:12.247
Hey! Vince, I just heard the news.

06:12.249 --> 06:14.215
Oh, that I fixed the toilet? Yeah.

06:14.217 --> 06:16.217
Wasn't easy, but she's good to go.

06:16.219 --> 06:17.485
- Let 'er rip.
- No.

06:17.487 --> 06:18.987
The news that you have a son

06:18.989 --> 06:20.956
that you're raising by yourself.

06:20.958 --> 06:22.801
- Yeah.
- I love kids.

06:22.812 --> 06:24.719
I just don't want to put
my body through a pregnancy.

06:24.730 --> 06:27.562
Wow. Yeah, Stevia, we've
never really talked before.

06:27.564 --> 06:29.775
You always get an important
phone call when I approach.

06:29.786 --> 06:32.200
That is because I thought
you were one of those creeps

06:32.202 --> 06:34.436
that just buys a gym so he can
see women stretching.

06:34.438 --> 06:38.173
Now I realize you're a good guy who
just really cares about flexibility.

06:38.175 --> 06:39.808
- Yeah.
- Would...

06:39.810 --> 06:42.143
Would you want to go out some time?

06:46.183 --> 06:49.317
Sorry, I'm not available this weekend.

06:49.319 --> 06:53.054
My brother and I have agreed
not to date until 2028.

06:53.056 --> 06:54.656
Wow.

06:54.658 --> 06:56.691
I have literally never been
rejected before.

06:56.693 --> 06:59.194
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
- I love it.

07:05.853 --> 07:08.355
So, Michael, I was paid
a slightly annoying visit

07:08.357 --> 07:10.223
by your uncle today.

07:10.225 --> 07:12.412
Mm, okay, I didn't think
it was annoying.

07:12.423 --> 07:14.334
All I did was pop my head
in your office,

07:14.345 --> 07:16.358
I said, "Dilly dilly," and then I left.

07:16.360 --> 07:18.427
No, your Uncle Ro, your mom's brother...

07:18.429 --> 07:20.862
rich, handsome, no kid, no gym,
huge loser.

07:20.864 --> 07:22.798
- Wait. Uncle Ro is here?
- Yeah, well...

07:22.800 --> 07:26.368
He invited us
to dinner at this slop shop

07:26.370 --> 07:28.503
that he owns called L'Trine.

07:28.505 --> 07:29.938
- Pass, right?
- Are you kidding?

07:29.940 --> 07:31.506
He owns L'Trine?

07:31.508 --> 07:34.509
The VIP section can only be unlocked

07:34.511 --> 07:36.478
with the head of an Oscar statue.

07:36.480 --> 07:39.514
I don't know...
Uncle Ro, Uncle Matthew...

07:39.516 --> 07:41.516
do you really need that many uncles?

07:41.518 --> 07:42.951
One nephew is plenty for me.

07:42.953 --> 07:44.786
Ro's not just an uncle.

07:44.788 --> 07:46.455
He's like the family celebrity.

07:46.457 --> 07:48.292
He just takes over a room
when he enters.

07:48.303 --> 07:50.959
Oh, you mean like pop-music sensation...

07:50.961 --> 07:52.494
- Demi Lova-toe?
- What?

07:52.496 --> 07:54.196
No, Demi Lovato's notoriously shy.

07:54.198 --> 07:56.428
- I thought everyone knew that.
- No, I know. I knew that.

07:56.439 --> 07:57.996
Well, don't you have homework to do?

07:58.007 --> 08:00.702
Everyone certainly had some thoughts
on your morning-routine essay.

08:00.704 --> 08:02.738
Just a report on Lerner and Loewe.

08:02.740 --> 08:04.506
You know who that is, right?

08:04.508 --> 08:07.843
Yeah, duh, I know who he,
she, or... or they are.

08:07.845 --> 08:09.235
Great! So you can help me.

08:09.246 --> 08:10.912
I can't believe we're going to L'Trine.

08:10.914 --> 08:13.048
I have to pick out an outfit...
from Barney's.

08:13.050 --> 08:15.083
But if it's too expensive,

08:15.085 --> 08:16.585
I can ask Uncle Ro to pay for it.

08:16.587 --> 08:18.420
- No, mm-mm.
- No.

08:18.422 --> 08:19.788
I can cover that.

08:19.790 --> 08:22.424
What do you got? I've got $50, $64.

08:22.426 --> 08:24.760
- I got one $2 bill.
- Okay, that's...

08:24.762 --> 08:27.462
To be perfectly honest,
I wasn't fully sold on New York

08:27.464 --> 08:29.231
until I saw this staircase.

08:29.233 --> 08:31.867
The crystal work on that
chandelee-a is exquisite.

08:33.770 --> 08:35.470
Whoa.

08:35.472 --> 08:38.073
This place is even fancier
than I thought.

08:38.075 --> 08:40.142
The plates are iPads.

08:40.144 --> 08:43.845
Yeah, I guess it's nice, but
in, like, a really obvious way.

08:43.847 --> 08:46.181
I prefer an old-world elegance.

08:46.183 --> 08:47.841
No way this place has Crazy Bread.

08:47.852 --> 08:49.651
Well, I'm glad I whitened
my teeth for this.

08:49.653 --> 08:51.820
Sure, my gums are burning
and bleeding a little bit,

08:51.822 --> 08:52.988
but it was worth it.

08:52.990 --> 08:54.656
Uncle Ro, over here.

08:54.658 --> 08:56.792
Hey, Michael. What's up, man?

08:56.794 --> 08:59.111
Hey, you remember that handshake
LeBron taught us, right?

08:59.122 --> 09:00.184
Oh, yeah.

09:01.265 --> 09:02.697
Give it to me.

09:04.168 --> 09:05.700
Pose.

09:06.303 --> 09:08.003
- What's up, guys?
- both: Hey, Ro.

09:08.005 --> 09:09.971
$100?

09:09.973 --> 09:12.140
These guys don't even give me
an allowance.

09:12.142 --> 09:14.943
- We don't want to spoil him.
- Yeah, and we're too poor.

09:14.945 --> 09:17.646
Well, as they say,
no man is poor who has friends.

09:17.648 --> 09:20.015
Am I right? Come on, buddy, let's go.

09:20.017 --> 09:22.617
How long have I been begging
for a family handshake?

09:22.619 --> 09:24.886
How long?

09:24.888 --> 09:26.221
<i>This place is amazing.</i>

09:26.223 --> 09:28.442
I found a diamond in my risotto.

09:28.453 --> 09:30.225
So how are you two enjoying your meals?

09:30.227 --> 09:32.395
These chicken fingers
are actually pretty dope.

09:32.406 --> 09:34.563
Thanks for letting me order
off the Li'l Tycoons menu.

09:34.565 --> 09:35.897
My mouth's bleeding too much

09:35.899 --> 09:37.732
for me to taste anything
but my own blood.

09:37.734 --> 09:39.201
Gentlemen, how about a toast, huh?

09:39.203 --> 09:43.672
To Vincent and Matthew,
for raising my sister's son.

09:43.674 --> 09:45.073
Obviously, I could never do it

09:45.075 --> 09:47.209
with all the responsibility
of my job, so...

09:47.211 --> 09:50.679
- my hat's off to you.
- And a toast to you, Ro,

09:50.681 --> 09:52.614
for, uh...

09:52.616 --> 09:54.916
- Um, for...
- Treating us to best meal

09:54.918 --> 09:56.585
we've ever had.

10:09.833 --> 10:11.133
So I must be honest.

10:11.135 --> 10:12.934
I didn't just invite you guys here

10:12.936 --> 10:14.936
so Matthew could steal
the sugar packets for home.

10:14.947 --> 10:17.339
Oh, they're not for home.
I feed these to police horses.

10:17.341 --> 10:18.840
Oh, my God.

10:18.842 --> 10:20.442
Anyway, I was hoping
I could take Michael

10:20.444 --> 10:22.386
for one weekend a month,
starting with this weekend.

10:22.397 --> 10:24.308
I have house seats to
"Mean Girls" on Broadway,

10:24.319 --> 10:26.448
but only if you're
interested in musical theater

10:26.450 --> 10:28.316
and strong female voices, so...

10:30.187 --> 10:31.920
Those are my favorite things!

10:31.922 --> 10:34.867
I am sorry, but no one's ever been
so dialed into my essence before.

10:34.878 --> 10:36.841
Well, unfortunately, that's
actually not gonna work,

10:36.852 --> 10:38.411
because we already have plans
this weekend.

10:38.422 --> 10:39.445
Really?

10:39.456 --> 10:41.211
I, uh, bought 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle.

10:41.222 --> 10:43.165
It's a field of wheat.
It's impossible, so...

10:43.167 --> 10:44.799
Come on, Vince, you're his father.

10:44.801 --> 10:46.801
Let me take Michael this weekend.

10:46.803 --> 10:48.336
Well, you know what?

10:48.338 --> 10:50.438
- It might not be a bad idea.
- What?

10:52.376 --> 10:54.209
What's with the attitude? It's unisex.

10:54.211 --> 10:56.011
- Please.
- What are you thinking?

10:56.013 --> 10:58.046
You can't let Ro take Michael
for a whole weekend.

10:58.048 --> 10:59.893
He's so into him just from tonight.

10:59.904 --> 11:01.850
Another two days, he'll want
to move in with him.

11:01.852 --> 11:04.386
I know, I know, okay?
But Michael loves Broadway.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.364
And we could never afford
tickets to "Mean Girls."

11:06.375 --> 11:07.756
The only theater we can take him to

11:07.758 --> 11:09.391
is the painted silver
guy in Times Square.

11:09.393 --> 11:11.189
- And we don't even tip him.
- I don't get it.

11:11.200 --> 11:13.895
You just changed your mind so fast.

11:13.897 --> 11:16.677
What? No, no. No, no, I
felt this way for a while.

11:16.688 --> 11:19.067
And you know what? The more
time anyone spends with Ro,

11:19.069 --> 11:20.334
the more they dislike him.

11:20.345 --> 11:22.537
By the end of the weekend,
Michael will be begging

11:22.539 --> 11:24.039
for us to come pick him up, all right?

11:24.050 --> 11:26.374
It's like making a kid smoke
an entire pack of cigarettes.

11:26.376 --> 11:28.777
Dad did that, and we were
both addicted for ten years.

11:28.779 --> 11:29.927
But maybe you're right.

11:29.938 --> 11:32.247
Maybe Michael will find him
more annoying with time.

11:32.249 --> 11:34.171
I know I do. Did you see
the way he glared at me

11:34.182 --> 11:36.818
when I spilled that bottle of wine
everywhere? I mean, come on, it's old.

11:36.820 --> 11:38.286
It was from 1952.

11:38.288 --> 11:39.888
Mm-hmm.

11:39.890 --> 11:42.123
So we talked it over,

11:42.125 --> 11:43.825
and you can go.

11:43.827 --> 11:45.460
Thank you so much... I
promise I will record

11:45.462 --> 11:47.162
the entire thing on my phone.

11:47.164 --> 11:48.830
- You're welcome.
- I'm gonna go get our coats.

11:48.832 --> 11:49.848
Cool.

11:52.836 --> 11:55.604
_

11:55.968 --> 12:00.195
_

12:07.045 --> 12:10.747
Well, I dropped Michael
off with Ro. We both cried.

12:10.749 --> 12:12.549
Or rather, I cried enough
for the both of us.

12:12.551 --> 12:13.850
Wait. What are you doing back?

12:13.852 --> 12:15.196
You always go out on the weekend.

12:15.207 --> 12:17.091
That was before we agreed
to stop dating people.

12:17.102 --> 12:19.155
Right, yeah, 'cause we are not dating.

12:19.157 --> 12:20.890
- Hey, guys.
- Ruby?

12:20.892 --> 12:22.559
Check it... this Korean place

12:22.561 --> 12:25.176
gave me a butt load of raw meat
they didn't want.

12:25.187 --> 12:26.429
Fire up the microwave.

12:26.431 --> 12:28.164
So you're both

12:28.166 --> 12:30.133
- hanging out here.
- All night.

12:30.135 --> 12:32.602
We're bingeing the entire
Lerner and Loewe catalog,

12:32.604 --> 12:34.395
so I can help Michael with his report.

12:34.406 --> 12:36.335
First up, "Paint Your Wagon."

12:36.346 --> 12:38.050
Clint Eastwood stars
in a lighthearted tale

12:38.061 --> 12:39.303
about the buying and selling of women.

12:39.314 --> 12:40.910
I'm not a musical-theater buff,

12:40.912 --> 12:42.846
but if Dirty Harry's in it
and Rob Lowe wrote it,

12:42.848 --> 12:44.147
paint me interested.

12:44.149 --> 12:46.916
Uh, yeah.

12:56.394 --> 12:59.062
Dingdong. Hey, Vince.

12:59.064 --> 13:00.763
Hey, Stevia.

13:00.765 --> 13:02.031
Stevia?

13:02.033 --> 13:04.167
Wait. This is why you let Ro
take Michael?

13:04.169 --> 13:07.103
You traded your son
for a night of passion.

13:07.105 --> 13:09.405
This is so not...

13:11.042 --> 13:12.448
- Lit.
- Okay.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.182
I imagine Michael will be the only one

13:14.193 --> 13:15.678
having a worse night than me tonight.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.147
This is the best night of my life!

13:17.149 --> 13:19.215
My God, "Mean Girls" was so good.

13:19.217 --> 13:20.783
Even Vince would think it was fetch.

13:20.785 --> 13:22.418
Maybe I should text him
just to check in.

13:22.420 --> 13:24.554
I'm impressed you have any battery left

13:24.556 --> 13:27.357
after all the flash photos
you took during the show.

13:27.359 --> 13:28.658
But look, make it quick, okay?

13:28.660 --> 13:30.126
I have one big surprise for you.

13:30.128 --> 13:31.961
You're my real dad, my mom is my aunt,

13:31.963 --> 13:33.630
and Huma Abedin is my real mom?

13:33.632 --> 13:35.031
Sadly, no.

13:35.033 --> 13:36.766
Huma and I could never make it work,

13:36.768 --> 13:40.336
but I was able to get us
a private after-hours tour

13:40.338 --> 13:42.672
of the M&M Store in Times Square.

13:42.674 --> 13:44.974
What? No. It's too much.

13:44.976 --> 13:46.843
Wait. Who's gonna be the tour guide?

13:46.845 --> 13:49.779
- No, don't tell me! Is it...
- Yep.

13:49.781 --> 13:51.581
The green one.

13:51.583 --> 13:53.416
Oh! Finally.

13:53.418 --> 13:55.318
I'm seeing the real New York.

13:55.320 --> 13:58.021
I don't know if Eliza's
ready for the Embassy Ball.

13:58.023 --> 14:00.190
Her accent is all over the place,

14:00.192 --> 14:01.991
to say nothing of her temper.

14:01.993 --> 14:03.459
What?

14:03.461 --> 14:04.961
You don't think Michael's
having a better time

14:04.963 --> 14:07.678
- with Ro than if he was here, do you?
- Oh, I definitely think Michael

14:07.689 --> 14:10.633
is having a better time, but I
have bigger things to worry about,

14:10.635 --> 14:13.169
like if Audrey Hepburn's
tiny neck is gonna snap

14:13.171 --> 14:14.504
underneath the weight of that hat.

14:19.044 --> 14:20.577
Before we go any further,

14:20.579 --> 14:22.879
I have something
really important to ask you.

14:22.881 --> 14:24.914
- Sure.
- Do you believe in fairies?

14:24.916 --> 14:27.917
I have a friend who went
to England and saw one.

14:27.919 --> 14:30.186
Apparently they look like
little dots of light,

14:30.188 --> 14:32.989
but up close, it's like a bug.

14:32.991 --> 14:34.724
Sounds like a lightning bug.

14:34.726 --> 14:36.259
Have you ever seen a lightning bug?

14:36.261 --> 14:37.393
Yeah.

14:37.395 --> 14:39.028
That was a fairy.

14:39.030 --> 14:41.864
Oh, my God, tell me everything.

14:41.866 --> 14:43.844
- I was 12. Um...
- Oh.

14:43.855 --> 14:45.768
You know, I was not looking
forward to tonight,

14:45.770 --> 14:48.638
but it turns out Leroy and Loaf
can really weave a tale.

14:48.640 --> 14:50.940
I was too distracted to pay attention.

14:50.942 --> 14:53.743
I just keep wondering, if Ro's so great,

14:53.745 --> 14:55.545
why didn't Priya ask him
to take Michael?

14:55.547 --> 14:57.814
Uh, 'cause Vince is
the dad and he has rights?

14:57.816 --> 14:59.582
Didn't you read Alec Baldwin's book?

14:59.584 --> 15:01.484
You know I did!

15:01.486 --> 15:03.786
The part where he gets cast
in "Working Girl" made me cry.

15:03.788 --> 15:05.421
It's just that Priya hates Vince

15:05.423 --> 15:07.423
and never once mentioned Ro.

15:07.425 --> 15:09.120
There's only one thing left to do.

15:09.131 --> 15:10.551
Watch "Gig-y" and forget about this

15:10.562 --> 15:12.662
- 'cause it's boring.
- No.

15:12.664 --> 15:14.364
I'm calling Priya.

15:14.366 --> 15:16.011
<i>And everything you can see on the ground</i>

15:16.022 --> 15:17.567
<i>just falls away...</i>

15:17.569 --> 15:19.469
<i>until it disappears.</i>

15:19.471 --> 15:21.571
<i>How old are you, Sassenach?
I failed to ask.</i>

15:24.245 --> 15:26.078
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, Priya, it's Matthew...</i>

15:26.089 --> 15:27.701
<i>Michael's uncle/best friend.</i>

15:27.712 --> 15:29.279
<i>I'm watching "Outlander," Matthew!</i>

15:29.281 --> 15:31.147
Come on! They're going across a heath.

15:31.149 --> 15:33.116
Sorry to bother you on a Saturday night,

15:33.118 --> 15:35.618
but why did you ask Michael
to live with us and not Ro?

15:35.620 --> 15:38.496
Two reasons... Alec Baldwin's book
convinced me of dad's rights,

15:38.507 --> 15:40.456
and two, because my brother
is a drug addict.

15:40.467 --> 15:41.599
Last time he came to visit,

15:41.610 --> 15:43.373
I took him to the nursing home
where I work.

15:43.384 --> 15:45.084
I caught him drinking a morphine drip

15:45.095 --> 15:46.728
like a friggin' Capri Sun.

15:46.965 --> 15:48.398
Wait.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.199
You didn't let him see Michael, did you?

15:51.569 --> 15:52.635
Uh, no.

15:52.646 --> 15:54.337
No, no, no, Michael...

15:54.339 --> 15:56.739
Michael is here with me right now.

15:56.741 --> 15:57.974
Where?

15:57.976 --> 15:59.208
Please.

15:59.210 --> 16:01.444
Hi, Mom! I love you.

16:01.446 --> 16:03.413
<i>I love being Indian.</i>

16:03.415 --> 16:05.248
Yay, musicals.

16:05.250 --> 16:07.750
Oh, sweetie, it's so good
to hear your voice.

16:07.752 --> 16:09.616
I love you, too, and I...

16:09.627 --> 16:12.822
Hello? Hello?

16:12.824 --> 16:14.324
<i>Ro, your place is amazing.</i>

16:14.326 --> 16:16.159
<i>It's like if Saddam Hussein had taste.</i>

16:16.161 --> 16:17.994
Hey! You want something to drink?

16:17.996 --> 16:20.063
I got juice, soda,

16:20.065 --> 16:21.931
discontinued energy drinks from Korea...

16:21.933 --> 16:23.599
North Korea.

16:23.601 --> 16:25.868
No, thanks, that 64-ounce
Big Gulp you gave me

16:25.870 --> 16:27.170
was more than enough.

16:27.172 --> 16:28.805
Can I just use the bathroom?

16:28.807 --> 16:31.502
Cool. So, hey, listen...

16:31.513 --> 16:33.076
while you're in there, you mind dropping

16:33.078 --> 16:35.678
a quick little splash in here for me?

16:35.680 --> 16:36.955
This has your name on it.

16:36.966 --> 16:39.673
Right, but it'll have your pee in it.

16:39.684 --> 16:42.952
- Isn't that funny?
- No. It's weird.

16:42.954 --> 16:44.687
Wait. Is this for a drug test?

16:44.689 --> 16:46.756
Oh, my God. Do you do drugs?

16:46.758 --> 16:48.330
But you're not a mom with a back injury.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.759
It's not what you think.

16:49.761 --> 16:52.428
My job is really stressful,
and I always need to be sharp.

16:52.430 --> 16:54.197
So don't think of it as drugs.

16:54.199 --> 16:56.699
Think of it as... coffee
you drink with your nose.

16:56.701 --> 16:58.768
So the only reason you wanted me here

16:58.770 --> 17:00.670
was to get my pee?

17:00.672 --> 17:02.305
Were those even your real tears

17:02.307 --> 17:04.272
when Tina Fey came out
and sang the finale?

17:04.275 --> 17:05.742
You're my nephew, and I love you.

17:05.743 --> 17:08.010
And I had a great time with you tonight.

17:08.012 --> 17:09.679
And we can keep having great times

17:09.681 --> 17:11.948
as long as you keep peeing
in that cup for me

17:11.950 --> 17:13.281
every two weeks.

17:13.284 --> 17:16.953
Next time we could even see
"Hello, Dolly."

17:16.954 --> 17:19.355
With Bernadette Peters or Donna Murphy?

17:20.948 --> 17:22.848
Vince! We need to talk to you.

17:22.851 --> 17:25.085
- What the hell?
- Ro's a drug addict.

17:25.096 --> 17:26.819
What? He is?

17:26.821 --> 17:29.312
Yes! I knew I was better than Ro.

17:29.323 --> 17:31.456
He has an addiction?
I'm just disappointing.

17:31.458 --> 17:33.058
So good.

17:33.060 --> 17:34.520
Oh, my God, I had my phone on silent.

17:34.531 --> 17:37.062
Michael texted me, like, a
million times with slam effect.

17:37.064 --> 17:39.398
- We got to go get him.
- Uh, you're leaving?

17:39.400 --> 17:42.668
Uh, look, it's just gonna be,
like, five hours, tops.

17:42.670 --> 17:44.770
Just, uh, hang tight.
Powerade's in the fridge.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.806
Help yourself to my cheaper beers.

17:47.808 --> 17:50.642
Look, I'm sorry, this...
this isn't gonna work.

17:50.644 --> 17:52.277
I got to go get my son.

17:52.279 --> 17:53.979
<i>Open up, Ro!</i>

17:53.981 --> 17:57.582
We know you're in there,
and we know why you're so fun!

17:57.584 --> 17:59.317
- Right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:59.319 --> 18:01.115
Hey, guys, what are you doing here?

18:01.126 --> 18:02.688
You know, I'd invite you in, but, uh...

18:02.690 --> 18:04.045
Michael's already asleep.

18:04.056 --> 18:06.958
So whoever said it's exhausting
being poor has never been rich.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.294
We want our precious baby boy back!

18:09.296 --> 18:10.662
Priya told us you're a drug addict.

18:10.664 --> 18:12.497
Which we can all agree is a lot worse

18:12.499 --> 18:13.765
than not knowing how to swim.

18:13.767 --> 18:15.333
And you call yourself an uncle.

18:15.335 --> 18:17.261
I wouldn't expect this
from a second cousin!

18:17.272 --> 18:18.886
Guys, come on. We're all adults here.

18:18.897 --> 18:20.639
We all do stuff to take
the edge off, right?

18:20.641 --> 18:22.974
You do it with exercise.
You do it with screaming.

18:22.976 --> 18:25.644
You do it with... chronic masturbation?

18:29.683 --> 18:31.650
It prevents prostate cancer.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.985
Michael! Michael. Where is he?

18:33.987 --> 18:35.654
Matthew, check the cabinets. He's tiny.

18:35.656 --> 18:36.988
Oh. Guys, guys...

18:36.990 --> 18:39.491
he's live-tweeting from the bathroom.

18:39.493 --> 18:40.992
- Hey.
- Oh, thank God you're here.

18:40.994 --> 18:42.454
When you didn't respond to my texts,

18:42.465 --> 18:44.329
I thought you were doing
that weird old-person thing

18:44.331 --> 18:45.920
where you turn your phone off at night.

18:45.931 --> 18:48.500
Ro wanted my pee to pass a drug test.

18:48.502 --> 18:49.801
What? No.

18:49.803 --> 18:51.670
I wanted to test Michael for drugs.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.355
The way he was dancing
in the aisles at "Mean Girls,"

18:53.366 --> 18:54.573
I thought he was on something.

18:54.575 --> 18:56.246
As someone who was
popular in high school,

18:56.257 --> 18:57.743
I know for a fact that no one

18:57.745 --> 18:59.411
would ever sell drugs to Michael.

18:59.413 --> 19:01.146
He has no money,
and he looks like a narc.

19:01.148 --> 19:02.748
Are you sure?

19:02.750 --> 19:04.683
I'd like five drugs, please.

19:04.685 --> 19:07.919
Every time I see you perform, I
realize Meryl Streep is trash.

19:07.921 --> 19:10.088
And to think...

19:10.090 --> 19:12.157
I was jealous of your life, Ro.

19:12.159 --> 19:14.860
But after tonight, I'm only
jealous of parts of it.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.528
Like, I will for sure hit you up

19:16.530 --> 19:17.996
for a reservation at L'Trine,

19:17.998 --> 19:20.599
but we can deal with that over email.

19:20.601 --> 19:22.100
Peace.

19:22.102 --> 19:23.935
I'm keeping the jacket

19:23.937 --> 19:26.571
and the gold toothbrush
I found in the bathroom.

19:30.444 --> 19:32.544
You know, Ro, I thought you were cool,

19:32.546 --> 19:34.045
and you really let me down.

19:34.047 --> 19:35.847
I don't know a lot of Indian people,

19:35.849 --> 19:39.751
so this will really affect
my opinion of all of them.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.722
<i>You know, if you think about it,</i>

19:43.724 --> 19:45.957
Ro's a lot like the evil
villain in "My Fair Lady"...

19:45.959 --> 19:47.692
Eliza Doolittle,

19:47.694 --> 19:49.728
a woman pretending to be
someone she's not.

19:49.730 --> 19:52.063
Oh, my God. That is such
a subversive take.

19:52.065 --> 19:53.598
I'm going to tweet that.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.734
I've never thought of a tweet before.

19:55.736 --> 19:56.935
Thank you.

19:56.937 --> 19:58.870
Hey, Michael, listen, um...

19:58.872 --> 20:01.740
before you lived with us,
we were pretty active socially.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.909
Well, you weren't really,
but Matthew definitely was.

20:03.911 --> 20:07.078
Anyway, the point is,
I'm sorry I missed your texts.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.047
I was distracted,
and I shouldn't have been.

20:09.049 --> 20:10.916
So I'm just gonna pump the brakes

20:10.918 --> 20:12.417
on dating for a little bit.

20:12.419 --> 20:13.952
Really? So no more parade of women

20:13.954 --> 20:15.487
leaving the house every morning?

20:15.489 --> 20:17.155
I got plenty of time to date,

20:17.157 --> 20:18.824
and you're only gonna be a teenager

20:18.826 --> 20:19.991
for a few more years.

20:19.993 --> 20:21.793
Excuse me, young man,

20:21.795 --> 20:24.896
you remind me of Montgomery Clift.

20:24.898 --> 20:26.498
Could you spare a kiss?

20:26.500 --> 20:29.134
Sure, why not?

20:33.607 --> 20:36.208
Get your fat foot out of the way.

20:39.613 --> 20:42.614
Hey, that girl Stevia
dropped this off for you.

20:42.616 --> 20:44.783
It's a magazine quiz.

20:44.794 --> 20:46.375
"How to know if someone's bad in bed

20:46.386 --> 20:47.786
before you sleep with them."

20:47.788 --> 20:50.956
- What?
- Ah, you can do better.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.824
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

20:53.794 --> 20:56.194
Oh, uh, I almost forgot the other reason

20:56.196 --> 20:58.263
- why I came in here.
- Right.

20:58.265 --> 20:59.497
- Mm-hmm.
- Cool.

20:59.499 --> 21:00.832
- Yep.
- Thank you.

21:02.135 --> 21:04.002
Good balance, sturdy handle.

21:04.004 --> 21:06.104
This baby's top shelf.

21:06.106 --> 21:08.740
We gonna do some damage.
