01:19.400 --> 01:21.436
So, Mom, what's the big surprise?

01:21.640 --> 01:24.871
Why are we sitting here
like blind Lone Rangers?

01:25.640 --> 01:26.675
Yeah.

01:26.880 --> 01:29.758
And why can I still hear you
with this mask on?

01:30.520 --> 01:33.080
Just hang on, kids.

01:33.280 --> 01:37.319
Here it comes.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.871
Oh, my God, an M&M.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.794
And I got a W&W.

01:48.160 --> 01:49.639
Hey, wait a second.

01:49.840 --> 01:52.308
Why are you treating us so good?

01:53.280 --> 01:56.238
Yeah, Mom. Why'd you cook for us?

01:57.000 --> 01:59.355
Well, can't a mother show her love?

02:02.040 --> 02:03.075
Okay.

02:03.280 --> 02:04.952
I did it so you'd be in good moods...

02:05.160 --> 02:07.879
...when I told you that my relatives
are coming for a visit.

02:08.800 --> 02:11.951
No. Not Zemus and Ida Mae.

02:13.040 --> 02:16.919
Oh, hush.
They both wear clothes now...

02:17.160 --> 02:20.118
...and they're not gonna
be any trouble to anyone.

02:33.760 --> 02:38.436
Hey, Peg, did you know
we're out of towels in the bathroom?

02:47.760 --> 02:50.320
Guess you didn't tell Dad
your family was coming.

02:50.520 --> 02:53.159
Well, he never warns me
when he is...

02:55.040 --> 02:57.793
...so I feel like I owe him nothing.

03:00.320 --> 03:01.992
God, I love Sundays.

03:02.200 --> 03:04.919
The one day of the week
I get to sleep later than you, Peg.

03:05.160 --> 03:07.469
Saturday night I stay up
extra, extra late...

03:07.680 --> 03:10.194
...eat an enormous amount
of tacos...

03:10.400 --> 03:13.278
...to make absolutely sure
there's no way in the world...

03:13.480 --> 03:15.869
...that when I wake up,
you'll be next to me.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.439
You don't have to eat tacos
for that, honey.

03:20.040 --> 03:22.759
But I can't afford
to take that chance, Peg.

03:23.040 --> 03:27.795
But when I know you're gone, I can
finally slip out of my underwear...

03:28.120 --> 03:31.510
...and sleep safely naked
as God intended.

03:32.840 --> 03:35.308
Oh, the sensations.

03:35.520 --> 03:38.796
Why, with Mommy gone,
I almost feel sexual.

03:40.440 --> 03:42.556
Yeah, nothing can ruin Sunday
for me.

03:42.760 --> 03:44.318
Wait a minute. What's that?

03:45.880 --> 03:47.472
Open your mouth.

03:49.880 --> 03:51.677
It's an M&M.

03:52.840 --> 03:55.559
Oh, God. Your family's coming!

03:56.680 --> 03:58.750
How much time do I have?

03:59.920 --> 04:01.956
Great Caesar's ghost, they're here!

04:02.160 --> 04:04.151
- Have you made the preparations?
- Of course.

04:04.360 --> 04:06.590
- What about the dog?
- He's ready.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.952
Shouldn't we have a sign like that?

04:19.160 --> 04:21.435
Here, here.
Everybody take one of these.

04:21.640 --> 04:25.474
If they move on you, smack them
on the nose and say, " No. "

04:27.680 --> 04:30.831
Open up! We know you're in there!

04:37.480 --> 04:38.799
I'm coming.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.959
All right, now, kids,
smile as if Daddy had died.

04:48.400 --> 04:50.072
Okay.

05:09.040 --> 05:12.510
- Zemus, Ida Mae.
- Peggy.

05:12.720 --> 05:14.756
You look good enough to eat.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.789
- Little cousin.
- No.

05:22.600 --> 05:26.354
- Big boy.
- Don't even dream about it, Zemus.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.110
So where's the dog?

05:33.920 --> 05:35.558
By the way, what's with that line?

05:35.760 --> 05:37.432
Are you gonna tie it to your porch...

05:37.640 --> 05:39.835
...to make sure you can
find your way home?

05:40.400 --> 05:42.834
No, it's for our youngest child.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.076
We believe in giving the boy
a little freedom.

05:45.280 --> 05:47.555
That way, if he feels cooped up
in the Winnebago...

05:47.760 --> 05:50.479
...he can gallop alongside of us
down the highway.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.909
Folks, meet little Seven.

05:55.960 --> 05:59.111
Seven?
Well, why'd you pick that name?

05:59.360 --> 06:03.717
Because we had one, two, three,
four, five, seven kids.

06:04.880 --> 06:08.509
- Say hi to your cousin.
- Oh, hello.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.835
Is that the one
who's gonna give me money?

06:13.040 --> 06:17.397
Yeah, that's the rich one.
Go bond with him.

06:20.920 --> 06:24.196
I love you, you big lug.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.471
Give me money.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.031
Do you know where your knee is?

06:29.240 --> 06:32.152
Yes, I do, so give me money.

06:34.520 --> 06:37.956
Kids, why don't you take
little Seven upstairs.

06:38.160 --> 06:39.912
Come here, Seven.

06:41.720 --> 06:43.153
We'll take him up to Bud's room.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.555
Have you ever seen
a rubber woman?

06:49.080 --> 06:52.993
Isis is not rubber,
she's breathable latex.

06:54.240 --> 06:57.073
And she breaks, just like a little girl.

06:59.280 --> 07:01.077
Come on in.

07:24.440 --> 07:26.590
Isn't this nice?

07:27.120 --> 07:29.475
We're swingers.
We're into swapping.

07:36.640 --> 07:40.952
But don't be put off, it doesn't have to
be the traditional man-woman thing.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.678
And this little Peggy
never goes to market.

07:52.880 --> 07:55.792
And this little Peggy stays home.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.788
And this little Peggy eats bonbons.

08:01.440 --> 08:04.716
And these little children have none.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.390
I want them to do the song again.

08:09.640 --> 08:12.074
He only wants us to do it
because he knows we hate it.

08:12.920 --> 08:15.559
- Is that true, Seven?
- Yes.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.838
And a-one and a-two.

08:19.720 --> 08:21.278
<i>- Baby face
- Baby face</i>

08:21.480 --> 08:25.075
<i>- You've got the cutest little baby face
- You've got the cutest little baby face</i>

08:25.280 --> 08:27.510
<i>- Not another one could tak e your place

08:27.720 --> 08:29.711
<i>- Baby facel

08:34.159 --> 08:35.751
Hi, kids.

08:37.840 --> 08:40.638
- Good to be home.
- Where did you disappear to?

08:40.880 --> 08:42.631
Well, I crawled
under the doggy door...

08:42.840 --> 08:46.276
...when Zemus turned out the lights
and said, " Let's exchange trousers. "

08:46.840 --> 08:49.513
Is that your real nose?

08:54.960 --> 08:59.556
Seven, if you were thinking of pulling
his hair, try grabbing it out of his ears.

08:59.960 --> 09:03.157
Unlike his head, it just seems
to grow and grow and grow.

09:05.440 --> 09:09.558
Peg, why is this kid sitting on my lap?
Doesn't his father have a groin?

09:11.880 --> 09:16.032
By the way, where are the Kettles?

09:16.480 --> 09:19.631
Well, right after you left,
they went out for cigarettes.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.473
And you let them go?

09:24.720 --> 09:26.995
That has to be
the dumbest move in history.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.634
No, the second dumbest.
The first dumbest had to be...

09:29.840 --> 09:32.798
...when I answered your phone call
the day after we had sex.

09:36.960 --> 09:41.988
Peg, you just let these people
stick us with their kid.

09:42.440 --> 09:45.876
Oh, my God. I've got another child!

09:53.680 --> 09:56.478
Now, Peg, I'm gonna
remove my hands.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.478
Please don't show him
how upset you are.

10:03.280 --> 10:06.078
What's the matter?
Did he find out my folks are gone?

10:06.320 --> 10:09.278
No. No, no.
Just went out for cigarettes...

10:09.480 --> 10:11.118
- ... be right back.
- No, they won't.

10:11.360 --> 10:16.229
But that's okay. I'll just
live with Mommy and you, Daddy.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.869
<i>- Not another who could tak e your place
- Not another who could tak e your place</i>

10:29.880 --> 10:32.872
Oh, Peg, I've got another kid.

10:33.080 --> 10:35.548
Oh, got another kid.

10:36.320 --> 10:37.673
Oh, Al, I'm happy.

10:37.880 --> 10:40.189
I wanna keep him. The kids love him.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.311
And Buck has really taken to him.

10:42.520 --> 10:44.556
You should see the two of them
play together.

10:45.200 --> 10:49.079
- Oh, look, here he comes.
- Doggy, wanna go to the dentist?

10:53.800 --> 10:56.360
I guess he's still sore
from playing doctor.

11:03.560 --> 11:08.554
- What is it, Peg?
- It's just the love.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.477
Oh, Al, I have to keep him.

11:11.680 --> 11:14.672
This boy needs a mother,
and I am a born mommy.

11:14.920 --> 11:20.233
- Can I go throw rocks at cars?
- Sure, honey.

11:20.560 --> 11:23.313
Just look both ways before throwing.

11:26.520 --> 11:30.115
Well, hey, aren't you
a cute little guy.

11:35.640 --> 11:41.317
- Hey, mister, which car is yours?
- That pretty blue one.

11:48.680 --> 11:51.797
- So where are his parents?
- Oh, they went out for cigarettes.

11:52.480 --> 11:53.799
The old cigarette ploy.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.197
They stuck you with their kid,
and they're never coming back.

11:58.160 --> 12:02.392
So, what are you gonna name
this one, Financial Burden lll?

12:14.880 --> 12:16.757
Peggy, I envy you.

12:16.960 --> 12:21.670
A new child, and you didn't even
have to touch that man to get it.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.318
Yeah, I couldn't be happier.

12:24.520 --> 12:26.511
Of course,
Al will have to get another job.

12:26.720 --> 12:28.438
And it may be tough
on Bud and Kelly...

12:28.640 --> 12:31.313
...you know, with not enough love
to go around and all.

12:31.520 --> 12:34.830
But I don't really see
any downside for me.

12:35.960 --> 12:39.157
Gee, Al, another child.

12:39.360 --> 12:41.430
What a blessing.

12:42.360 --> 12:45.113
It shouldn't be much of a strain
on your salary...

12:45.360 --> 12:49.638
...which couldn't support a family of
goats in the mountains of Paraguay.

12:50.200 --> 12:54.432
But on the bright side,
another child could be such a joy.

12:54.680 --> 12:58.912
Let's take the time to think of all
the things that you can teach him.

12:59.160 --> 13:01.913
Well, I can't think of anything.
Can you?

13:05.760 --> 13:07.716
Now, Marcie...

13:08.320 --> 13:09.912
...don't take this as an insult...

13:10.120 --> 13:13.396
...you parakeet in a flannel shirt.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.076
But speaking as a friend...

13:16.280 --> 13:19.636
...your body shows no signs
of womanhood.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.310
Obvious to me, you're barren.

13:22.680 --> 13:24.238
And even if by some miracle...

13:24.440 --> 13:28.558
...you actually laid an egg
and then hatched a child...

13:28.760 --> 13:32.309
...and tried to breast-feed it,
the kid would starve to death.

13:37.760 --> 13:38.988
Let's face it, Marce...

13:39.200 --> 13:42.112
...there can't be enough milk in there
for a cup of coffee.

13:45.480 --> 13:49.029
So having said that with love...

13:49.600 --> 13:52.034
...from one friend to another...

13:52.240 --> 13:56.313
...I offer you the son you'll never
have. Let me go get his clothes.

13:58.120 --> 14:01.908
Al, I couldn't possibly
take anything from you.

14:02.120 --> 14:04.953
Instead, let me give you something.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.352
Ten fingers of death.

14:07.560 --> 14:11.155
I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!

14:11.920 --> 14:15.151
And I have breasts, damn it.

14:15.640 --> 14:18.757
She really does, Al.
You just can't see them.

14:23.760 --> 14:25.079
Right, honey?

14:25.280 --> 14:28.192
Like I can see everything on you?

14:30.280 --> 14:32.714
You said that wasn't important.

14:34.080 --> 14:35.399
Well, I lied.

14:37.640 --> 14:40.950
Wait a second.
Can't we go back to picking on Al?

14:42.560 --> 14:44.710
You're right, honey.

14:45.680 --> 14:50.470
So, Daddy No-Bucks,
where's the new kid gonna sleep?

14:55.680 --> 14:59.719
So that's the real story of the breakup
of me and Cindy Crawford.

15:02.760 --> 15:05.228
You know, you're not
that interesting either.

15:06.360 --> 15:10.114
And now, we put me to sleep.

15:14.560 --> 15:17.552
Don't mind me, Bud.
I just came in to say good night.

15:17.760 --> 15:20.274
- Good night.
- Yeah, thanks.

15:22.920 --> 15:27.914
- My little man.
- Mommy, he bored me.

15:28.760 --> 15:31.228
How about a nice little lullaby?

15:31.840 --> 15:34.195
Okay, here we go.

15:36.600 --> 15:39.433
<i>Hush, little baby, don't you cry</i>

15:39.640 --> 15:42.598
<i>Bud will be gone soon
So kiss him goodbye</i>

15:42.800 --> 15:46.270
<i>And if Bud won't leave on his own</i>

15:46.480 --> 15:49.677
I'll throw him out,
and then it'll just be me and you.

15:49.920 --> 15:52.150
I'll cook for you,
and everything will be so nice.

15:52.360 --> 15:55.397
Mom, Mom. He's sleeping.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.475
I guess I just got carried away.

15:58.680 --> 16:00.671
It's so hard to leave this little guy.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.191
Come here.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.192
Okay.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.428
Good night.

16:07.640 --> 16:09.949
- Good night, Mom.
- Yeah, thanks.

16:15.200 --> 16:19.159
Hooters. Oh, hooters,
come out and play.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.159
Bud...

16:23.960 --> 16:26.269
...I have to ask you a question.

16:27.080 --> 16:29.833
You have waited 19 years
for someone to get in bed with you.

16:30.040 --> 16:33.430
Tell me, is it everything
you had hoped for?

16:38.800 --> 16:42.918
Oh, I'm just teasing you, you little
emotionally arrested Smurf.

16:43.440 --> 16:44.873
I brought you a little present.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.196
Now that you're sharing
your pad with Seven...

16:47.400 --> 16:49.470
...I wanted to give you something
to decorate.

16:49.680 --> 16:51.477
A little eye candy
for the both of you.

16:57.320 --> 16:58.833
There you go, college man.

17:00.360 --> 17:02.112
"Wags, the Perplexed Pup. "

17:02.320 --> 17:06.472
Cartoon cutie.
Well, as if I had to tell you.

17:07.119 --> 17:10.874
<i>Hey, great place
for a Blossom calendar.</i>

17:13.599 --> 17:15.909
How much must I endure?

17:20.040 --> 17:22.395
God, she isn't bad, is she?

17:23.240 --> 17:26.311
Oh, God, look at my life.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.317
I don't get it.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.996
I'm so cute.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.671
What am I even doing home?

17:33.880 --> 17:37.156
I know I've got the bod,
got the arms...

17:37.360 --> 17:42.388
...the chest, and even I can't
keep my hands off my butt.

17:47.640 --> 17:50.200
You really should talk to Daddy.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.239
Anyway, I couldn't bear
to be away from this little guy.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.749
I'm gonna take him to bed with me.

18:00.600 --> 18:03.558
You do take that down
when friends are over, don't you?

18:08.280 --> 18:12.068
Well, at least I got some privacy.

18:12.520 --> 18:14.078
Hi, girls.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.756
Come to papa.

18:21.080 --> 18:23.719
Don't mind me, son.
Just avoiding your mother.

18:25.040 --> 18:27.110
Hey, now.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.149
What's this?

18:33.640 --> 18:37.030
" Hooters, absolutely no faces. "

18:38.280 --> 18:39.759
Goodish.

18:39.960 --> 18:42.554
- Come on, Dad.
- Go to sleep.

18:53.240 --> 18:55.674
Bud, did you do this?

18:56.600 --> 19:01.116
Oh, God, look at my life.
I'm sitting in my own son's wet spot.

19:02.760 --> 19:04.671
I don't get it.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.676
So cute.

19:10.080 --> 19:12.116
How could this be my fate?

19:12.480 --> 19:14.391
I should've married for money.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.716
I always had the bod.

19:17.680 --> 19:19.432
Got the arms.

19:21.240 --> 19:24.232
God never made a nicer butt.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.959
I can't live like this,
but I'll tell you what I can do.

19:35.160 --> 19:37.037
I'm gonna track down
Seven's parents...

19:37.240 --> 19:39.435
...and I'm gonna get this house
back to normal.

19:43.240 --> 19:46.516
And I want Wags hanging on my wall
when I get back, son.

19:54.360 --> 19:58.399
<i>- Fill her up, sir?
- Nope. Making a delivery.</i>

20:08.800 --> 20:12.429
<i>- Ninety-two octane?
- Yeah, whatever.</i>

20:18.320 --> 20:20.834
<i>And the Atlanta Braves
tak e the field.</i>

20:27.280 --> 20:32.070
Welcome to our monthly
underwear fashion show.

20:40.760 --> 20:43.911
And now,
here's supermodel, Zemus...

20:44.120 --> 20:48.079
...wearing lovely blue Hanes.

20:59.680 --> 21:02.035
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:02.600 --> 21:04.875
I think we should talk.

21:06.120 --> 21:09.112
Gee, I hope Daddy
doesn't find your parents...

21:09.320 --> 21:13.074
- ... so you can stay with us forever.
- Me too.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.472
Yeah, us too.

21:19.960 --> 21:23.589
Hi, Al. Did you find his parents?

21:27.040 --> 21:28.359
No.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.672
Couldn't find them.

21:37.720 --> 21:39.472
So we can keep him?

21:40.840 --> 21:42.637
Guess so.

21:43.320 --> 21:45.151
Daddy!

21:49.160 --> 21:54.075
Oh, by the way, everybody,
today was payday.
