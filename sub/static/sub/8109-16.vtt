Five weeks pre-term.

02:12.716 --> 02:16.550
The bracelet on your
baby's ankle has a microchip
that would set off alarms

02:16.678 --> 02:18.259

through an exit.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.486
When you were
dating Foreman...
No,no,no.

13:47.577 --> 13:48.737
What?

13:48.870 --> 13:51.327
If it was something
personal about him or us,

13:51.414 --> 13:53.655
| just don't think
that's right to answer.
We all work together.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.911
That's the whole
point of this game,
something personal,

13:56.044 --> 13:57.659
preferably embarrassing.
Just pick something else.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.164
You see,
this is your problem.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.246
You act like you're
so liberal and open,

14:01.341 --> 14:02.330
but you are the least...

14:02.425 --> 14:04.666
I changed my mind.
Dare. Just no nudity.

14:04.761 --> 14:09.425
Yes, nudity.
I want you to show
your breasts

14:10.725 --> 14:12.056
to Taub.

14:12.769 --> 14:16.011
That is the most
idiotic dare ever.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.891
Have you ever
played this game?

14:18.274 --> 14:21.858
Well, I thought showing me
your breasts would be
a little exploitative.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.356
Your dare is in
the future, genius.

14:24.447 --> 14:25.653
Hey, if you're saying
you won't do it...

14:25.740 --> 14:26.775
No,no,no,no.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.949
Of course
I'll show my breasts
to Taub,

14:30.078 --> 14:32.945
tomorrow, perhaps,
or maybe sometime
next year,

14:33.081 --> 14:35.697
you know, because
I'm honor-bound.

14:35.792 --> 14:36.907
Truth or dare?

14:41.214 --> 14:44.627
lt's understandable
that you wouldn't be
happy right now.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.959
Your world is changing.
Are you scared?

14:49.806 --> 14:51.637
And how do you feel
about your sister?

14:52.975 --> 14:54.385
I hate her.

14:59.440 --> 15:03.308
Walker, this is important.
Did you do anything
to the baby?

15:03.403 --> 15:06.736
Did you move
her somewhere?
Hide her?

15:06.823 --> 15:07.812
No.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.022
Nobody'll be mad at you.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.654
I said no,
so stop asking me.

15:16.916 --> 15:17.905
(PANTING)

15:18.000 --> 15:19.740
Bad pain day?

15:21.129 --> 15:22.665
Bad pain month.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.292
And since
I'm not using it...

15:26.843 --> 15:28.583
If you don't
want the morphine,

15:28.678 --> 15:31.260
you must have
something of your own.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.178
l was in rehab.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.678
Had a little problem
with the "something
of my own."

15:35.810 --> 15:38.517
Now all I take is ibuprofen,
and that's two flights up.

15:38.604 --> 15:39.764
For the whole month?

15:39.856 --> 15:43.519
The pain's migrated,
I think the arterial
wall is damaged.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.019
And what?
You don't know?

15:45.111 --> 15:47.352
I haven't had
an arteriogram yet.

15:47.613 --> 15:52.198
You don't want the test
in case the arterial wall
is fine,

15:52.285 --> 15:56.449
which would mean that
the pain is coming
from something else.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.664
What's her name?

16:00.543 --> 16:06.379
Interesting that you'd jump
from physical pain
to long-lost love.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.877
You're projecting.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.258
So, what's her name?

16:14.724 --> 16:15.964
What time is it?

16:16.058 --> 16:20.051
What does it matter to you?
It's T-minus four hours.

16:23.399 --> 16:26.983
8:20. Now tell me
who she is,

16:27.069 --> 16:31.403
and what are the
pathetically long odds that
she's gonna visit or call.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.773
Only that's a reason
not to take the morphine.

16:35.453 --> 16:37.535
(SCOFFS)

16:44.086 --> 16:45.246
Dude.

16:46.422 --> 16:47.502
Dude.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.586
Is the room
still spinning?

16:52.762 --> 16:54.172
Mine is.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.930
Maybe we shouldn't
have taken so many?

17:00.937 --> 17:02.973
I'm gonna try
to stand up.

17:04.065 --> 17:05.726
You be careful.

17:13.991 --> 17:15.242
(lNHALlNG)

17:15.618 --> 17:17.609
Oh, yeah,
that's working.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.705
I can't feel my face.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.408
No way.

17:26.587 --> 17:29.078
Way. Hit me.

17:29.465 --> 17:30.671
What?

17:30.800 --> 17:32.631
(LAUGHING)
Hit me in the face.

17:32.718 --> 17:33.969
Seriously?

17:34.053 --> 17:37.796
You know you've
always wanted to.
Now's your chance.

17:37.932 --> 17:42.221
That's a great idea.
We can start a fight club,
maybe we...

17:44.480 --> 17:48.564
Oh, my God,
you're right.
That is so cool.

17:48.651 --> 17:50.141
Okay, I'll even...

17:53.281 --> 17:55.317
I can still feel my hand.

17:56.117 --> 17:57.482
(LAUGHING)
I wasn't ready.

17:57.577 --> 18:00.990
What were you gonna do,
flex your goatee muscle?

18:01.122 --> 18:02.862
(BOTH LAUGHING)

18:04.250 --> 18:05.831
Wait a minute.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.580
This is your
credentials file?

18:08.671 --> 18:10.252
Give me that.

18:12.842 --> 18:16.505
That's why you
came down here,
not for the patient file.

18:17.179 --> 18:20.592
You wanted...
You wanted...

18:28.441 --> 18:32.275
Okay, Robert.
I will answer whatever
questions you want.

18:33.404 --> 18:36.567
But then you're gonna
have to sign the papers.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.110
Did you ever love me?

18:40.828 --> 18:42.443
How can you
even ask that?

18:42.538 --> 18:45.154
The first time you slept
with me was because
you were on crystal meth.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.786
l was on the drugs
because I was emotional.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.913
It was the emotions
that led to the sex,
not the drugs.

18:50.004 --> 18:51.289
Not true.

18:51.380 --> 18:54.417
After that, you refused
to let it go further
thanjustsex.

18:54.508 --> 18:56.669
Because I knew
I was falling for you
and I didn't want to.

18:56.761 --> 18:58.251
And that never changed.

18:58.346 --> 19:00.758
You broke off our vacation
because I bought you a ring.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.463
I got cold feet,
I'm not proud of it.

19:02.558 --> 19:03.923
And then you almost
called off our wedding

19:04.060 --> 19:05.846
because you couldn't
give up the idea...
No.

19:05.936 --> 19:07.312
Don't.
...of having your
dead husband's baby.

19:07.396 --> 19:08.977
Don't bring him up.
Because even then

19:09.065 --> 19:10.555
you weren't
sure about me.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.060
Maybe if I was dying
when you married me,

19:12.151 --> 19:13.231
it would've been
a bit different.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.308
That's not fair.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.064
It's not only fair,
it's exactly the point.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.864
He was dying when you
met him and he was gone
just a year into the marriage.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.451
So, it was all
a honeymoon with him,

19:21.535 --> 19:23.321
and I could never
match up to that.

19:23.454 --> 19:25.536
The first time
reality intruded on...
Stop this.

19:25.623 --> 19:27.614
Just tell me the truth.
About what?

19:27.708 --> 19:28.743
Did you ever love me?

19:28.834 --> 19:30.370
I don't know!

19:38.469 --> 19:40.960
Thank you for finally
telling me.

19:41.597 --> 19:42.882
(CRYING)

19:56.278 --> 19:57.484
Truth.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.195
You said you weren't
dating anyone now.

20:00.282 --> 20:03.615
Does that mean
you recently were
or soon will be?

20:05.621 --> 20:07.862
Oh. Look who's
guarded now.

20:07.957 --> 20:12.291
You had no problem
talking about your sex
life, but your love life...

20:12.670 --> 20:14.376
Fine, dare it is.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.165
No nudity.
Now or in the future.

20:25.808 --> 20:28.550
You're too much of
a nice boy, Wilson.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.969
Let's let the bad boy
out for a bit.

20:32.064 --> 20:36.524
You have to go steal
one dollar, right now.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.646
From who?

20:44.535 --> 20:45.866
Oh, come on.

20:46.454 --> 20:47.443
(MUMBLING)

20:47.538 --> 20:50.245
"lnterned at Hopkins,"
old news.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.460
Here we go!
"Academic probation."

20:53.544 --> 20:56.581
I'm asking you
to please stop reading.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.459
I'm afraid
I can't do that.

20:59.550 --> 21:02.587
"Faked a lab result."
Very wrong.

21:03.345 --> 21:07.714
And you came down
to destroy the record
before it gets digitized.

21:08.017 --> 21:10.599
Permanentized.
Even wronger.

21:14.190 --> 21:18.354
I needed to beat
all those elite,
spoiled kids around me.

21:19.528 --> 21:23.441
To show no weakness,
to win at everything.

21:25.201 --> 21:27.283
Why'd ljust
tell you that?

21:27.369 --> 21:29.576
I always talk too much
when I'm stoned.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.040
Why'd ljust tell you that?

21:37.546 --> 21:39.411
It was stupid.

21:39.507 --> 21:41.714
You had great grades.
One lab result shouldn't
have mattered.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.462
Except I didn't
think I deserved

21:43.552 --> 21:46.715
to be at a top med school
in the first place.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.046
Again.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.298
Faking a lab result
is one thing,

21:50.392 --> 21:54.055
but you needing
to come down here
to destroy the records

21:54.188 --> 21:56.270
12 years after the fact...

21:58.400 --> 21:59.651
(LAUGHS)

21:59.735 --> 22:01.942
This isn't about
med school.

22:02.363 --> 22:05.730
You don't think
you belong here
at the hospital.

22:09.620 --> 22:13.613
"Dr. Taub, comma,
Christopher Michael."

22:18.420 --> 22:22.083
So, this is what
it comes down to
in the final hours.

22:22.424 --> 22:24.710
Deifying some lost love.

22:24.802 --> 22:28.215
Hoping to get her
on the phone and make
everything perfect.

22:28.305 --> 22:29.681
lt's pathetic.

22:29.765 --> 22:33.223
Either you left her
for a reason or she
left you for a reason.

22:33.602 --> 22:34.637
A phone call
is not gonna...

22:34.728 --> 22:36.810
It's my daughter.

22:39.483 --> 22:40.768
So, why isn't she here?

22:41.694 --> 22:46.905
I left my family
when Gracie was six.

22:47.575 --> 22:51.284
l was sort of
forced out, actually,

22:52.454 --> 22:55.446
after I had had an affair
with a student.

22:56.166 --> 22:58.202
For sex or love?

22:58.294 --> 22:59.625
(SCOFFS) Neither.

23:01.505 --> 23:05.123
I'd only married
Gracie's mother
because of the baby.

23:06.302 --> 23:08.918
But I didn't think
I could handle
the commitment,

23:09.013 --> 23:13.473
and just like any
decent academic,
l proved myself right.

23:14.602 --> 23:17.514
And what time it is
matters because...

23:17.646 --> 23:19.978
She's a dance
teacher in Atlanta,

23:20.065 --> 23:21.930
she gets home
from work at 9:00,

23:22.026 --> 23:25.109
and ljust wanted
to speak to her
one more time.

23:26.655 --> 23:28.156
That's my story.

23:29.658 --> 23:30.864
What's yours?

23:32.828 --> 23:34.238
Same thing,
pretty much.

23:36.540 --> 23:39.657
I'm gonna be dead
in a few hours,

23:39.752 --> 23:41.868
your secrets
couldn't be safer,

23:43.005 --> 23:45.872
unless you're keeping
them from yourself.

23:50.304 --> 23:52.135
I like being alone.

23:54.016 --> 23:57.725
At least I convinced myself
that I'm better off that way.

23:59.396 --> 24:04.766
And then I met someone
in a psychiatric hospital
of all places.

24:06.195 --> 24:07.856
She changed me.

24:09.031 --> 24:10.862
And then she left.

24:14.745 --> 24:19.739
We're better off alone.
We suffer alone,
we die alone.

24:19.875 --> 24:24.039
Doesn't matter if
you're a model husband
or father of the year,

24:25.547 --> 24:27.378
tomorrow will be
the same for you.

24:30.260 --> 24:33.093
But yesterday
would've been different.

Dr. Wilson.

24:45.067 --> 24:47.274
Could you cook me up
a chicken sandwich?

It's important, medically.

Dr. Hadley needs
a high-protein meal
right now.

24:53.784 --> 24:57.572
She doesn't like to talk
about it but she
has hypoproteinemia.

24:57.663 --> 24:59.199
We got chicken salad.

24:59.289 --> 25:00.904
Yeah, that's cold.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.662
She needs
to eat warm protein
for this disease?

25:03.752 --> 25:05.583
Well, we could
give her cold protein

25:05.671 --> 25:07.832
whose uptake enzymes
haven't been activated,

25:07.923 --> 25:11.791
as long as you don't mind
her risking liver and kidney
failure and eventual death.

25:11.927 --> 25:15.715
But, hey, it's worth it
so you don't have
to flip on the grill.

25:15.806 --> 25:18.764
You don't have to be
obnoxious about it.

26:05.647 --> 26:08.434
How do you look so okay?

26:08.525 --> 26:12.313
I spent months wondering
howl made it go bad.

26:14.073 --> 26:19.318
If you never loved me,
then I didn't do
anything wrong.

Hey.

26:24.583 --> 26:25.993
Allison, come on.

26:27.669 --> 26:28.920
It's all right.

26:29.546 --> 26:31.878
Still don't know
why I said that.

26:32.841 --> 26:37.210
It's not even true.
I did love you.

26:39.723 --> 26:45.559
Just not in a way
that would have
ever worked.

26:47.397 --> 26:48.386
Why not?

26:48.482 --> 26:52.100
Because everything
you said is true.

I'm a mess.

26:58.033 --> 27:00.240
I married a man
I knew was dying,

27:00.369 --> 27:03.782
so God knows
how screwed up
I already was.

27:04.373 --> 27:07.706
Him dying messed
me up even more.

27:10.045 --> 27:12.377
I pushed you
out of my life.

27:14.216 --> 27:19.051
And I'm unfixable.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.548

28:16.278 --> 28:18.109
No, I didn't
even play fair.

28:19.364 --> 28:22.447
You asked me how my dad
reacted when I told
him I was bisexual.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.195
And the Huntington's.

28:24.286 --> 28:25.275
No tea party?

28:25.370 --> 28:26.576
I never told him.

28:26.663 --> 28:28.119
He's been through enough.

28:28.999 --> 28:32.412
So, hejust visits
his heterosexual,
healthy daughter,

28:32.502 --> 28:35.118
and you go out to dinner
and a movie and talk
about your garden?

28:35.214 --> 28:37.671
I work late.
He's staying
at my house.

28:37.799 --> 28:40.757
It's easier if
I stay elsewhere
as much as I can.

28:40.844 --> 28:43.586
You can't suppress your life
for his convenience.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.932
You don't see
a little irony in that?

28:46.016 --> 28:47.847
That's exactly what
you do for House.

28:47.976 --> 28:50.843
When he moved in with you,
you bought a bigger place
for him.

28:50.979 --> 28:52.890
No wonder you're
not dating anyone.

28:53.273 --> 28:54.683
You're right.

28:55.859 --> 29:00.649
That woman,
the woman I'm not
involved with,

29:00.739 --> 29:06.530
her name is Sam Carr.
But in 1990 and 1991,
it was Sam Wilson.

29:07.204 --> 29:08.865
Your ex-wife?

29:08.956 --> 29:11.743
No, my mother.
Yes, my ex-wife.

29:11.833 --> 29:15.417
Ex number one.
She friended me
a few weeks ago.

29:15.504 --> 29:18.667
We started e-mailing,
turns out she's
recently divorced,

29:18.757 --> 29:21.123
and lwanted
to ask her out.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.968
You can't take
a woman to dinner

29:25.055 --> 29:28.218
or else House will go
running straight back
to the loony bin?

29:28.308 --> 29:30.549
You're not worried
about House, you're
worried about yourself

29:30.644 --> 29:31.929
because she's an ex,

29:32.020 --> 29:35.183
so even dinner will mean
it's immediately serious.

29:38.402 --> 29:41.314
What are your
favorite parts that
you remember?

29:45.617 --> 29:49.826
I liked how,
when I'd wake up in
the middle of the night,

29:49.913 --> 29:51.869
you'd put your arm around me
and you wouldn't even wake up.

29:53.250 --> 29:57.835
I liked watching you stand up
to your dad at Christmas
when he yelled at your mom.

29:57.921 --> 30:02.415
How you didn't even
know you were strong,
but you were.

30:05.387 --> 30:06.797
What do you miss?

30:06.888 --> 30:08.139
I miss a lot.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.425
But when I think
about missing you,

30:13.520 --> 30:17.479
I think about that
dance class that we took,
for our wedding.

30:18.692 --> 30:20.102
It's weird.

30:23.989 --> 30:28.323
I think, "He's never
going to hold me
like that again."

A little girl.

32:30.449 --> 32:31.985
I adopted her last year.

32:32.075 --> 32:35.693
I adopted Walker
right after Donald

love Walker the way
I love my daughter?

32:44.671 --> 32:46.627
Does that make me
a horrible person?

some tissues.

33:03.356 --> 33:05.893
Did you request
some extra towels?

33:06.943 --> 33:09.400
No. What? Why?

33:13.200 --> 33:15.816
There are eight towels
in Sarah's room.

33:15.911 --> 33:17.117

up there and when.
