WEBVTT

00:01.569 --> 00:02.103
.

00:02.136 --> 00:02.536
- I am truly sorry

00:04.138 --> 00:06.407
for bringing my former friend
to Firehouse 51.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.442
I feel terrible
about what happened.

00:08.476 --> 00:10.611
- The problem with some
of the people that come in--

00:10.644 --> 00:13.114
- Hey, hey, that's enough.
Come on, that's it.

00:15.549 --> 00:18.119
- Not like this.

00:18.152 --> 00:20.254
- You're--

00:21.322 --> 00:23.791
I call it Molly's North.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.493
- You deserve better
than I can give you.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.261
I got a job that's never
gonna be able to put you first.

00:27.295 --> 00:29.063
And you deserve first.

00:29.097 --> 00:31.265
- I'm on probation at work.

00:31.299 --> 00:33.301
It's all fair game
as long as Ramon Dawson

00:33.334 --> 00:34.568
gets what he wants.

00:34.602 --> 00:35.569
You only think about yourself

00:35.603 --> 00:37.305
and I'm sick of it.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.173
Don't move!
We got you.

00:41.175 --> 00:43.411
Dad.

00:43.444 --> 00:45.246
- You're all right, Dad.

00:45.279 --> 00:47.415
Just breathe
nice and easy, in and out.

00:47.448 --> 00:48.816
*

00:48.849 --> 00:50.818
We need to apply
more pressure on his wounds.

00:50.851 --> 00:53.821
- I've got him,
just get us there, okay?

00:53.854 --> 01:01.129
*

01:01.329 --> 01:03.564
Gabby. Gabby.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.401
Get behind the wheel.

01:15.709 --> 01:18.379
*

01:27.588 --> 01:29.290
- Hey Ramon,
Gabby's still here,

01:29.323 --> 01:31.359
she's just driving us
to the hospital, okay?

01:38.666 --> 01:41.235
- Three minutes.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.574
- Whoa!

01:48.742 --> 01:50.578
Damn it.

01:50.611 --> 01:53.181
Taking another route.

02:04.492 --> 02:06.294
- His O2 sats are dropping.

02:07.561 --> 02:10.198
- He's got
a tension pneumothorax.

02:10.231 --> 02:11.465
- I'm pulling over.

02:11.499 --> 02:14.635
- No, I've got this,
keep driving.

02:19.640 --> 02:24.512
*

02:30.618 --> 02:33.254
All right, I've got it.

02:33.287 --> 02:35.656
Sats are coming up.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.525
86...

02:37.558 --> 02:39.660
90...

02:39.693 --> 02:41.729
- We're one minute away.

02:43.397 --> 02:44.432
- Incoming.

02:44.465 --> 02:45.766
Brett, Dawson, talk to me.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.668
- Victim is age 60,
multiple stab wounds

02:47.701 --> 02:48.669
to the chest and back.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.404
Decompressed in the rig.

02:50.438 --> 02:51.939
- All right, I've got it,
let's get him to Baghdad.

02:51.972 --> 02:54.242
Let's stabilize him
and get him to surgery,

02:54.275 --> 02:56.310
Dr. Rhodes is waiting.
Rotate!

02:56.344 --> 02:58.712
We'll transfer him on my count.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.948
Here we go.

03:00.981 --> 03:03.684
One, two, three, transfer.

03:05.386 --> 03:08.222
Let's get this out.
All right.

03:12.660 --> 03:16.196
- The patient is my dad.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.333
- I know.
We got him, Gabby.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.602
Let's go,
let's move, move, move.

03:27.475 --> 03:29.810
- He's gonna be all right.

03:29.843 --> 03:32.713
He's strong, like you.

03:46.327 --> 03:49.563
*

03:49.597 --> 03:51.999
- Gabby.
- Matt.

03:52.032 --> 03:53.534
- He's gonna be okay.

03:53.567 --> 03:56.337
Dr. Rhodes
is the best in Chicago.

03:56.370 --> 03:57.405
- Hey.

03:57.438 --> 03:58.772
How is he?

03:58.806 --> 04:01.842
- I don't know yet.
He's in surgery.

04:01.875 --> 04:04.278
- What happened
on that platform?

04:04.312 --> 04:05.813
- A guy was
some kind of psycho,

04:05.846 --> 04:07.748
screaming about his manifesto.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.383
Then suddenly,
he pulls out a knife

04:09.417 --> 04:10.851
and starts slashing people.

04:10.884 --> 04:13.654
And apparently, dad stepped in
to try to stop him.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.523
Bastard.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.791
- Yeah.

04:20.728 --> 04:23.631
- Um, I'm sorry,
I didn't bring you a coffee.

04:23.664 --> 04:26.367
- Oh, that's all right,
I'm wired enough as it is.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.635
It's good to see you.

04:27.668 --> 04:28.869
- If it wasn't for Brett,
Dad wouldn't have

04:28.902 --> 04:31.405
made it to surgery.

04:33.541 --> 04:35.609
- So, we did have to perform

04:35.643 --> 04:37.311
a thoracotomy on your father.

04:37.345 --> 04:39.780
Luckily, none of
the major vessels were injured

04:39.813 --> 04:42.450
so I sewed up
the laceration in his lung,

04:42.483 --> 04:45.085
repaired some of the damage.
He's gonna be okay.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.655
What'd I tell you?

04:47.688 --> 04:49.657
It's gonna take a lot more than
some L train psycho

04:49.690 --> 04:51.559
to bring Ramon Dawson down.

04:53.561 --> 04:55.095
- Sure.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.565
But just for a minute,
he's got to get his rest.

05:06.840 --> 05:10.844
*

05:10.878 --> 05:13.781
- Hey, Dad.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.583
- You look all right.

05:15.616 --> 05:19.487
You look like you went a few
extra round with Mayweather.

05:21.889 --> 05:25.826
What were you doing throwing
yourself in front of a knife?

05:29.129 --> 05:31.565
- Hey, save your strength, Pop.

05:31.599 --> 05:34.402
Doc says you're going to
be back to good in no time.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.770
Then the rest of the hoodlums
in Chicago better look out.

05:36.804 --> 05:43.877
*

05:44.678 --> 05:47.381
- Dawson is coming
in for shift today.

05:47.415 --> 05:48.582
Says she needs the distraction.

05:48.616 --> 05:51.452
- Psh, I don't blame her.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.856
I'm sorry about the other day.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.459
- I'm sorry for bringing
Hope here in the first place.

05:58.492 --> 06:00.794
- What happened
is on her, not you.

06:05.899 --> 06:08.636
- You left pretty early.

06:08.669 --> 06:11.439
- I had stuff to do.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.707
I have a life, the gym...

06:13.741 --> 06:15.443
Stuff.

06:16.777 --> 06:18.546
- Um...

06:18.579 --> 06:20.814
what was that?

06:20.848 --> 06:22.650
- Just, the way
you're talking to him,

06:22.683 --> 06:25.653
The awkward thing.

06:25.686 --> 06:28.522
Oh, fine, I kissed him.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.759
- Don't yell at me.
- I'm not yelling.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.694
- It happened the other night
when I was hammered,

06:33.727 --> 06:35.162
and I've been trying
to avoid him ever since,

06:35.195 --> 06:37.197
Which isn't easy
when you live together.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.533
And now he probably thinks

06:39.567 --> 06:41.602
that I still have
a thing for him.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.937
- Well...

06:44.772 --> 06:47.575
- I really need to get a life.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.781
- Antonio was at the hospital.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.650
It was really nice to see him,
I'm just not sure if--

06:56.684 --> 06:59.520
- Do not kiss him.

06:59.553 --> 07:02.790
You will deeply,
deeply regret it.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.925
- Well--
- Mm-mm.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.532
I'm the captain,
I can get you a sub right now.

07:11.565 --> 07:13.467
- I'm sure.
He's out of IC,

07:13.501 --> 07:16.236
and how much time can I spend
at the hospital anyway?

07:16.269 --> 07:18.005
I'll visit him at
our first ambo drop.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.641
- Okay.
- Dawson.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.676
Please give your father
our best thoughts and prayers

07:22.710 --> 07:24.878
for a speedy recovery.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.814
- I will.
Thanks, Chief.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.682
- There aren't a lot
of people out of uniform

07:28.716 --> 07:30.050
who would do what he did.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.919
- Yeah.
Brave guy.

07:35.756 --> 07:38.826
- You coming to this Molly's
North meeting that Otis set up?

07:38.859 --> 07:41.495
- I pulled
the injured dad card.

07:41.529 --> 07:42.930
Kidd's covering me.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.899
Lucky you.

07:47.735 --> 07:50.704
- Okay, Molly's North.

07:53.541 --> 07:55.843
- Oh, I drew them,
but I'm no artist.

07:55.876 --> 07:58.045
Look at these.

07:58.078 --> 08:01.048
Isn't she incredible?

08:01.081 --> 08:04.518
- Uh, we're having
a Molly's North meeting.

08:04.552 --> 08:05.886
- Cool.

08:06.654 --> 08:09.623
- Eh, looks like
quite a makeover.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.725
- Well, you know,
Mac's went out of business,

08:11.759 --> 08:14.562
So we can't just
slap a new sign out front.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.664
We have to give it a facelift,
let the world know

08:16.697 --> 08:18.932
that it's something new.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.938
- Okay. I know that
this is a partnership,

08:24.972 --> 08:27.741
but this new location
was my idea,

08:27.775 --> 08:30.611
and I have kind of a vision
for how to do it.

08:30.644 --> 08:33.046
So, why don't you let me
run point on this?

08:36.083 --> 08:38.952
*

08:38.986 --> 08:41.121
- So long as
it's a money maker,

08:41.154 --> 08:44.792
and not a money drainer,

08:44.825 --> 08:46.694
go with God.

08:46.727 --> 08:49.697
- That's the plan.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.699
- So you're
going to handle everything?

08:51.732 --> 08:54.668
The opening,
arranging the publicity.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.770
- Yeah.

08:56.804 --> 08:59.907
No sweat.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.909
- Truck 81, Ambulance 61,

09:01.942 --> 09:04.111
- Whoops.
We got to go save some lives.

09:04.144 --> 09:07.648
We'll uh, regroup later, okay?
- Okay.

09:09.817 --> 09:11.985
- I never said thank you.

09:13.987 --> 09:17.725
- You saved my dad's life,
and I didn't say thank you.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.059
- Oh, Come on, Dawson,

09:19.092 --> 09:21.595
you don't have
to thank me for that.

09:21.629 --> 09:23.130
- Yeah, I do.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.768
And when my dad
starts driving me crazy again,

09:27.801 --> 09:30.003
I can blame you.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.943
- It was good
to see Antonio again.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.811
- Oh, here we go.

09:37.845 --> 09:44.885
*

09:50.758 --> 09:51.959
- Hey.

09:51.992 --> 09:54.094
- Hey, I feel
stupid calling you guys,

09:54.127 --> 09:55.763
but something ain't right here.

09:55.796 --> 09:56.997
- Let's take a look.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.933
*

09:59.967 --> 10:01.869
- It's right through here.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.806
- Yeah, that's
not supposed to happen.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.207
Looks like a shorted circuit.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.976
Could be an electrical fire
somewhere.

10:09.009 --> 10:11.078
- Whoa!

10:11.111 --> 10:13.947
- You know, it's probably
that old nut in 1C.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.649
He's tripping
breakers all the time,

10:15.683 --> 10:16.917
God knows what
he does in there.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.719
- Okay,
let's find this fire quick.

10:18.752 --> 10:21.789
- Herrmann, Otis,
check out apartment 1C.

10:23.190 --> 10:26.059
- Fire department.

10:26.093 --> 10:28.862
- I'm smelling smoke.
- Yeah, me too.

10:28.896 --> 10:31.231
- Hey, we got smoke in unit
1C, we're gonna force entry.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.666
- Copy that, Otis.

10:35.836 --> 10:38.238
Fire department, call out.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.651
Fire department!

10:55.055 --> 10:57.858
- Hey, got somebody!

11:06.233 --> 11:06.399
.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.334
- Right over here, guys.
- Found him unconscious,

11:08.468 --> 11:10.070
with shallow breathing.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.972
No apparent trauma involved.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.106
- I'll get him some oxygen.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.374
- Let's get a pulse-ox on him,

11:14.407 --> 11:15.809
cardiac monitor
and check his sugar.

11:22.149 --> 11:23.116
- There it is.

11:23.150 --> 11:25.052
- Okay.
Kidd.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.154
- Here you go, Chief.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.327
Okay, hit it.

11:42.102 --> 11:44.071
- Yup, it's out.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.441
- Damn.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.478
What the hell happened to you?

12:01.288 --> 12:03.290
[indistinct chatter
over radio]

12:03.323 --> 12:04.424
- We're going
to take good care of you,

12:04.457 --> 12:06.159
get you to the hospital.

12:06.193 --> 12:08.495
- I've got no insurance.

12:08.528 --> 12:11.331
- You can sort that out later.
You need medical attention.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.767
- But I got no insurance.

12:13.801 --> 12:17.137
- Don't give these ladies
a hard time now, Stoke.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.106
- They're going to
take care of you.

12:23.877 --> 12:31.084
*

12:40.828 --> 12:42.462
- Hey, mind if I--
- Of course.

12:42.495 --> 12:45.232
Yeah, check on your dad,
I got this.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.369
- Wow.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.104
- Look at this, mija.

12:51.138 --> 12:54.407
That one over there
is from the TV station.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.544
That big one there,
that's from the mayor's office.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.813
- That's great, Dad.

12:59.847 --> 13:01.214
A lot of people
are proud of you.

13:01.248 --> 13:04.117
- Yeah.
Your mom came visiting me.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.452
- Oh yeah, she told me.

13:05.485 --> 13:08.188
- I've been trying
to get that woman

13:08.221 --> 13:11.358
to call me back for a year.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.161
Turns out,
all I had to do was

13:14.194 --> 13:16.496
get stabbed a few times.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.934
That was a joke.
Look--hey, look at this.

13:20.968 --> 13:24.304
I got all these interviews
with some newspapers

13:24.337 --> 13:27.240
and other television stations.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.509
- Didn't Dr. Rhodes
say you needed to get rest?

13:29.542 --> 13:32.880
- Yes, he did, but he also said
that I'm going to be all right.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.448
- You'll be all right
with rest and rehab.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.517
- Yup.
- Promise.

13:37.550 --> 13:40.187
I cross my heart.

13:41.488 --> 13:44.257
Oh, look at that.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.359
That looks like somebody
pulled up a whole garden.

13:47.627 --> 13:48.896
- Okay, I got
to get back to work.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.197
I'll stop by after shift, okay.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.599
- Okay. Love you.
- Love you.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.270
- Mmm.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.172
- Yeah, dude.
Dig in.

13:59.206 --> 14:00.407
- Oh, man.
Maybe we should give

14:00.440 --> 14:01.875
brownies away at the opening,

14:01.909 --> 14:03.276
that'd get people
through the door.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.245
- Oh, hey, I was thinking.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.546
My old neighbor, Julius,

14:06.579 --> 14:09.149
he sells taxi top advertising.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.417
You know those
signs on top of cabs?

14:10.450 --> 14:12.519
- Sure.
- So I asked Julius,

14:12.552 --> 14:15.555
and he said he can do a rate
of 250 bucks a top for you.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.424
- Sounds pretty reasonable.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.426
Thanks, Cruz, I would have
never thought of that.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.628
- I know how much
this bar means to you.

14:22.595 --> 14:25.265
- Hey, you know what,
tell Julius we're in.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.200
- All right.
- Let's do this.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.401
- Whoa.

14:28.435 --> 14:29.937
Are those
Cindy Herrmann brownies?

14:29.970 --> 14:32.005
- Annabelle Herrmann brownies.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.309
- Yep.

14:36.343 --> 14:37.978
- Ehh.

14:41.014 --> 14:48.221
*

14:49.589 --> 14:51.491
So, uh, everything good

14:51.524 --> 14:53.994
with you and Kidd?
- Yeah, she's the best.

14:54.027 --> 14:57.430
- You haven't noticed
her acting a...

14:57.464 --> 14:59.699
a little off?

14:59.732 --> 15:03.203
- I think she's maybe riding
herself a little hard

15:03.236 --> 15:05.238
for the other night,
when she had a few too many.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.975
Might have done
some things she regrets.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.709
- You tell her
not to worry about it?

15:09.742 --> 15:11.611
- Well, I'm going
to let her sort it out.

15:11.644 --> 15:14.681
If she wants to talk
to me about it, she will.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.950
- Okay.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.629
- Yeah.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.331
- Casey.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.500
- When 61 gets back,
send them my way, would you?

15:33.533 --> 15:35.635
I'm curious about
the old man's condition.

15:35.668 --> 15:38.071
- Sure thing, Chief.

15:38.105 --> 15:41.008
- Why do you suppose
he had all those humidifiers?

15:41.041 --> 15:43.410
- Probably a lung thing.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.645
My Uncle Ricky,
lifelong smoker,

15:45.678 --> 15:48.982
he couldn't survive without
a humidifier toward the end.

15:49.016 --> 15:50.984
- That's not right.

15:51.018 --> 15:53.286
He was too good
to end up like that.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.290
- No, the guy we pulled
out of that apartment.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.428
- Stoke Porter.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.596
South Side Stoke?

16:03.630 --> 16:05.632
Legend of the blues harmonica?

16:05.665 --> 16:07.100
- Never heard of him.

16:07.134 --> 16:09.669
- Then you need
your horizons broadened.

16:09.702 --> 16:13.540
What do you say we reconvene
tomorrow night at my place

16:13.573 --> 16:16.676
for cigars,
bourbon and blues?

16:17.777 --> 16:19.412
- Sounds good to me, Chief.

16:19.446 --> 16:20.647
- Ah.

16:21.548 --> 16:24.451
- Oh, well I'd have
to run it by Trudy.

16:27.454 --> 16:29.522
But yes, I will be there.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.359
- Good.

16:34.594 --> 16:37.330
- Why are you and me hanging
out at Boden's tomorrow night?

16:37.364 --> 16:38.731
- I don't know.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.533
But he seems
to need it right now.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.535
So we're gonna do it.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.440
- Friday is in four days.

16:47.474 --> 16:49.576
You don't think
that's a little soon

16:49.609 --> 16:52.712
to transform
Mac's into Molly's,

16:52.745 --> 16:55.082
stock the bar, get the drink
menus printed up,

16:55.115 --> 16:57.484
and the advertising in place,
et cetera?

16:57.517 --> 16:59.752
- I already got
the advertising locked up.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.588
- Great. Uh.

17:01.621 --> 17:04.391
Friday.
Why Friday?

17:04.424 --> 17:06.459
- Because Friday is the 9th.

17:06.493 --> 17:08.061
And that's
Lily's lucky number.

17:08.095 --> 17:11.664
And she said that
Mercury is in retrograde.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.733
Or is it not in retrograde?
Which is the good one?

17:13.766 --> 17:16.703
- Otis, you have to open big,

17:16.736 --> 17:20.373
or this bar is never
going to get off the ground.

17:20.407 --> 17:22.109
- I got this.

17:25.512 --> 17:26.746
- How are you going
to stand there

17:26.779 --> 17:28.481
and let him
run point on this?

17:28.515 --> 17:30.550
He's just trying
to impress Lily,

17:30.583 --> 17:33.486
who's...never
going to sleep with him

17:33.520 --> 17:34.754
by the way.

17:34.787 --> 17:36.623
- No, he's right.
This is his idea.

17:36.656 --> 17:39.426
I've ridden him
enough in this life.

17:39.459 --> 17:43.530
- Oh.
Oh I see, not caring.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.133
Hmm. Well, this
is a new attitude

17:46.166 --> 17:50.470
that I am also going
to apply to my life.

17:52.472 --> 17:53.640
Huh.

17:53.673 --> 17:56.509
*

18:03.416 --> 18:04.817
- Antonio.

18:06.653 --> 18:10.657
- It occurred to me you left
your sweatshirt at my place.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.759
- It says "Diego."

18:16.596 --> 18:18.765
It doesn't look
like his size.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.674
- I mean, sure.

18:27.707 --> 18:33.780
*

18:35.848 --> 18:38.685
- They're at Molly's.
- Oh.

18:41.188 --> 18:43.523
- He's enjoying the hell
out of his 15 minutes,

18:43.556 --> 18:44.891
that's for sure.

18:44.924 --> 18:47.160
- He deserves it.

18:48.761 --> 18:51.164
- When I saw
you at the hospital,

18:51.198 --> 18:53.566
I knew I was in trouble.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.735
- Antonio,
I'm just not sure if--

19:01.508 --> 19:04.677
I have more to say.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.713
- I'm listening.

19:06.746 --> 19:12.585
*

19:12.619 --> 19:14.787
- This is not a good idea.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.923
- Maybe it's a one-time thing.

19:18.625 --> 19:21.728
- Yeah. There's no reason
to over-think it.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.730
- Okay.

19:34.907 --> 19:35.575
- What do you
want me to say?

19:36.543 --> 19:38.245
I was headed home,

19:38.278 --> 19:40.447
and there was this guy on the--

19:40.480 --> 19:41.848
when is this gonna air?

19:41.881 --> 19:43.716
- We're doing a shoot here.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.852
Just gotta keep the hall clear.

19:45.885 --> 19:47.387
- Oh.

19:47.420 --> 19:50.857
Uh, sure, yeah, I'll just...
come back later.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.492
- How long a segment
is this going to be?

19:52.525 --> 19:55.295
- You don't have
to worry about anything--

19:56.996 --> 19:59.299
Uh, so just give us
a minute.

19:59.332 --> 20:00.467
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.968
- Mm-hmm.

20:02.001 --> 20:04.003
Otis.
What are you doing here?

20:04.036 --> 20:05.838
I thought you were painting
the Molly's North sign.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.940
- Oh yeah, I'm just waiting
for the first coat to dry.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.376
Listen, the distributor

20:09.409 --> 20:10.843
can't guarantee
a delivery by Friday.

20:10.877 --> 20:11.978
So I figured
I would just grab

20:12.011 --> 20:13.813
a few cases from our stock.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.349
You know, just some
of the well liquor, the basics.

20:16.383 --> 20:18.485
- Hey, you got a little--

20:18.518 --> 20:20.887
- Never mind.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.389
- Hey, did Julius get

20:22.422 --> 20:23.990
Lily's artwork
for the taxi tops?

20:24.023 --> 20:25.592
- Yeah, oh, yeah, and now,

20:25.625 --> 20:27.460
he needs
a signature on this.

20:27.494 --> 20:30.997
And a cashier's check
for 25 grand.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.900
25...thousand?

20:33.933 --> 20:36.002
- Mm-hmm.

20:37.404 --> 20:38.438
- Yeah.
- I thought you said

20:38.471 --> 20:41.508
that taxis were $250 a top.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.910
- Yeah, with
a minimum of 100 cabs.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.012
- You never said that!

20:49.949 --> 20:51.618
- Yeah, I was wondering where

20:51.651 --> 20:53.386
you were going to get
that kind of money.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.887
- Oh, God.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.389
We're toast.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.491
We got zero publicity.

20:58.525 --> 21:00.327
Nothing!

21:00.360 --> 21:03.796
*

21:03.830 --> 21:05.932
- Okay, there's
this guy at my gym

21:05.965 --> 21:07.400
who's been hitting on me
for months.

21:07.434 --> 21:09.936
He's a morning DJ
at 95.8 FM.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.538
Maybe if I bat my eyelashes,

21:11.571 --> 21:14.006
I could finagle
a little free press out of him.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.409
- Oh, my God.
Yes.

21:16.443 --> 21:18.010
Put me on the radio.

21:19.646 --> 21:21.614
Mm, I just thought that
maybe he could mention

21:21.648 --> 21:23.383
the Molly's North opening
on the air.

21:23.416 --> 21:26.085
- No, no, no, have you
never heard my podcast?

21:26.118 --> 21:28.087
You just put me
on the radio,

21:28.120 --> 21:30.590
and then just
watch the magic happen.

21:31.891 --> 21:34.961
- I'll, uh--
I'll see what I can do.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.095
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.064
- This is gonna murder.

21:46.406 --> 21:47.974
*

21:48.007 --> 21:50.577
- This is really good.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.612
- So is this.

21:52.645 --> 21:53.913
*

21:55.482 --> 21:57.650
You know,
I can't help wondering,

21:57.684 --> 22:00.453
what good is a man's legacy?

22:00.487 --> 22:02.088
Take your father-in-law.

22:02.121 --> 22:03.890
Tried to help someone,
tried to do something good.

22:03.923 --> 22:06.593
Instead, he nearly dies
on a grimy train platform.

22:06.626 --> 22:09.996
- Yeah, but he's
going to pull through fine.

22:10.029 --> 22:14.100
*

22:14.133 --> 22:17.036
- Stoke Porter.

22:17.069 --> 22:20.039
He brought life to this music.

22:20.072 --> 22:22.008
He created art.

22:22.041 --> 22:24.611
What thanks does he get?

22:24.644 --> 22:26.646
He ends up broke,

22:26.679 --> 22:29.382
sick...

22:30.750 --> 22:33.119
Suffering alone.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.528
Where is that bottle?

22:45.064 --> 22:47.066
- I have no idea.

22:47.099 --> 22:50.069
Just drink your bourbon,
let the man talk it out.

22:55.508 --> 22:58.044
You know,
we should pay him a visit.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.114
- Let him know
he's not forgotten.

23:02.148 --> 23:04.417
- That's a fine idea.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.659
- Hey.
- Yeah, great, I'm in.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.594
- Pass me the album.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.663
- That one. Yep.

23:21.568 --> 23:24.537
Um, excuse me,
we know it's late,

23:24.571 --> 23:28.508
but, uh, we were hoping
to say hi to Stoke Porter.

23:30.643 --> 23:34.080
- Uh, yes, ma'am.
I guess so.

23:34.113 --> 23:35.715
- You're not family, then.

23:35.748 --> 23:39.619
- No, we were the firefighters
that brought him in.

23:39.652 --> 23:41.020
- Oh.

23:41.053 --> 23:44.223
I'm sorry,
Mr. Porter didn't make it.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.796
*

23:49.829 --> 23:51.998
- That's terrible.

23:52.031 --> 23:53.666
- Yeah.

23:53.700 --> 23:56.803
His daughter flew in
from Dallas to see him, but...

23:56.836 --> 24:00.507
he didn't hang on
long enough.

24:00.540 --> 24:03.710
- I'm really sorry
for your loss.

24:03.743 --> 24:06.245
- Are you friends
of my father's?

24:06.278 --> 24:08.180
- No, not really,

24:08.214 --> 24:10.817
we just had the pleasure
of meeting him.

24:10.850 --> 24:13.753
- Then you knew him
about as well as I did.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.688
- Oh.

24:15.722 --> 24:18.625
- Stoke lived his own way, and
my mom had had enough of it.

24:18.658 --> 24:22.595
So she took me
far away from my father.

24:22.629 --> 24:25.698
Now all I have left
are his debts.

24:32.138 --> 24:37.844
*

24:41.548 --> 24:41.714
.

24:41.748 --> 24:42.615
- Mitch and the guys
are on commercial break,

24:44.183 --> 24:45.552
so just come right in,
get comfortable.

24:45.585 --> 24:47.286
both: Okay.
- Thanks.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.556
- This is Mitch
and the guys.

24:49.589 --> 24:50.957
- Hi!
- Hey, Stella.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.593
- Hi.

24:53.626 --> 24:55.628
- Hey, Mitch, just, thank you.

24:55.662 --> 24:57.129
Thank you for
letting us do this.

24:57.163 --> 24:59.298
- Yeah no problem.
- This is Brian...

24:59.331 --> 25:00.767
- Oh!
- From Molly's North.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.168
- Hey, Brian, man.

25:02.201 --> 25:03.703
Hey, there's
your chair over there.

25:03.736 --> 25:05.638
Why don't you
throw those headphones on

25:05.672 --> 25:07.273
and don't lean too
close to the mic, all right?

25:07.306 --> 25:09.275
- It's okay,
it's not my first rodeo.

25:09.308 --> 25:10.877
- All right, great!
- All right, we're back

25:10.910 --> 25:14.280
in five, four, three...

25:15.948 --> 25:18.184
- All right, we've got
a guest in the studio today.

25:18.217 --> 25:21.220
Brian! Brian's here to
tell us about his cool new bar

25:21.253 --> 25:23.956
opening up
in Bucktown tomorrow night.

25:23.990 --> 25:26.726
What's the place
called, Brian?

25:28.327 --> 25:31.731
- Uh...

25:31.764 --> 25:33.633
- The name of the bar, buddy,
what's the bar called?

25:33.666 --> 25:35.301
- Sorry, it's called Mac's.

25:35.334 --> 25:37.670
No, it's not called Mac's.
Mac's actually closed down.

25:37.704 --> 25:39.305
It's called...

25:39.338 --> 25:41.808
Um...

25:41.841 --> 25:45.311
- The excitement is building.

25:45.344 --> 25:47.747
- Our listeners
are sitting in their cars

25:47.780 --> 25:51.951
right now, waiting
for you to say something.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.820
Anything, Brian!

25:53.853 --> 25:55.321
It's called Molly's--

25:57.890 --> 26:00.927
- Sorry, buddy!

26:00.960 --> 26:03.663
Sorry, sorry.
Go ahead Brian, I'm sorry man.

26:03.696 --> 26:05.798
- It's called Molly's--

26:08.300 --> 26:09.936
- I got you, I got you.

26:09.969 --> 26:12.639
I'm sorry man, go ahead.

26:12.672 --> 26:14.807
- Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

26:14.841 --> 26:15.975
- Molly's--

26:17.710 --> 26:20.346
- Come on,
it wasn't a total bust.

26:20.379 --> 26:22.649
- It's not a good promotion
if the people didn't even hear

26:22.682 --> 26:24.884
the name of the bar
over all the fart noises.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.820
Hey, your boyfriend
really screwed us over.

26:27.854 --> 26:29.789
- A, not my boyfriend.

26:29.822 --> 26:33.693
B, "Put me on the radio
and watch the magic happen."

26:33.726 --> 26:35.061
- Otis, dude,
that was hilarious stuff.

26:35.094 --> 26:36.663
- Shut up, Capp.

26:36.696 --> 26:38.898
- Oh, God.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.633
- The name of the bar
is Molly's North.

26:40.667 --> 26:42.835
- I know! You don't
think I feel bad enough?

26:42.869 --> 26:44.704
That was humiliating.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.372
I'm just praying
Lily didn't tune in.

26:48.741 --> 26:51.744
Oh, yep, she did.

26:51.778 --> 26:54.747
Aw, she feels bad for me.

27:01.854 --> 27:04.090
- Dawson.

27:04.123 --> 27:05.892
How's your dad doing?

27:05.925 --> 27:07.894
- Uh, pretty good, actually.

27:07.927 --> 27:10.997
Handling it a lot better
than I am, that's for sure.

27:11.030 --> 27:15.001
- It's not easy
dealing with a hurting parent.

27:15.034 --> 27:18.437
Are you getting
enough time off to go see him?

27:18.470 --> 27:22.041
- Oh, no, he's got
plenty of visitors right now.

27:22.074 --> 27:24.276
Reporters, well-wishers.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.979
Half the city's
been in his hospital room.

27:27.013 --> 27:29.882
- Well, I'm glad he's
getting some nice attention,

27:29.916 --> 27:33.019
but I'm sure
he'd rather have you there.

27:33.052 --> 27:34.921
- Maybe.

27:34.954 --> 27:37.056
- Definitely.

27:37.089 --> 27:39.025
I've met the man.

27:40.960 --> 27:44.030
- I'll go by
and see him after shift.

27:44.063 --> 27:46.298
- Good.

27:46.332 --> 27:50.302
- You know all these people
celebrating him...

27:50.336 --> 27:53.005
it's pretty amazing actually.

27:56.909 --> 27:58.978
- Squad Three, Ambulance 61,

27:59.011 --> 28:01.714
structure fire,
1400 Edgemont Ave.

28:06.886 --> 28:13.960
*

28:23.002 --> 28:24.837
- Could be.

28:24.871 --> 28:26.472
We got everyone out
and knocked down the fire,

28:26.505 --> 28:28.474
but we're still waiting
to hear overhaul's complete.

28:28.507 --> 28:29.976
- All right,
we'll help you mop up.

28:30.009 --> 28:31.477
Hey, Cruz, you come with me.

28:31.510 --> 28:32.845
Tony, Capp, you guys
sit tight a minute.

28:32.879 --> 28:34.113
- Copy that.

28:34.146 --> 28:36.482
- I don't think so,
but ask around.

28:36.515 --> 28:42.088
*

28:44.023 --> 28:47.526
Nobody's having trouble
breathing, no burns?

28:47.559 --> 28:48.995
Here honey,
let's have a look.

28:49.028 --> 28:51.530
- Hey!
What are you doing there, hon?

28:51.563 --> 28:53.099
You got to stay
clear of that building.

28:53.132 --> 28:54.801
- I just left my purse inside.

28:54.834 --> 28:56.368
can I go grab it really quick?
- No, sorry, no.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.503
There was a fire.
Stay way back, please.

28:57.536 --> 28:59.872
- Okay.

28:59.906 --> 29:01.808
- Hey, Brett, let's
get some oxygen over here.

29:01.841 --> 29:03.976
- Yeah, have a seat ma'am.

29:04.010 --> 29:06.212
- Damn it.
Brett, tell 37

29:06.245 --> 29:08.080
we have a civilian going
in through the back.

29:08.114 --> 29:10.883
Where are you going?

29:13.920 --> 29:20.492
*

29:20.526 --> 29:23.129
- It's definitely
a lot smokier back here.

29:23.162 --> 29:24.997
- Copy that, Severide.

29:29.268 --> 29:30.937
- Hey! You can't be in here.

29:30.970 --> 29:32.571
We got to get
out of the building now.

29:32.604 --> 29:35.041
- Oh, yeah, here we go.

29:35.074 --> 29:37.810
We got a fire in the ceiling
in the back hallway.

29:37.844 --> 29:39.846
It's right by
the central oxygen system.

29:39.879 --> 29:41.413
- Kiddo, the fire
might not be out yet, let's go.

29:41.447 --> 29:44.116
- Wait, my bag's right here.
- Come on, we got to go.

29:46.919 --> 29:48.821
- Get down!

29:52.324 --> 29:52.491
.

29:58.530 --> 30:04.170
*

30:04.203 --> 30:06.105
- Dawson,
what are you doing in here?

30:06.138 --> 30:08.440
- Long story,
help me get her out.

30:19.451 --> 30:22.354
- Come on, let's move.

30:31.463 --> 30:33.199
- This way!

30:33.232 --> 30:40.306
*

30:59.491 --> 31:01.894
- Easy, easy now.
You took a big bump.

31:01.928 --> 31:05.331
Just lay back,
let me take a look at you.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.134
All right, how many fingers
am I holding up?

31:08.167 --> 31:09.135
- Three.

31:09.168 --> 31:11.303
- Two.

31:12.371 --> 31:13.539
- It's Bria.

31:13.572 --> 31:15.541
- Hi Bria.
I'm Gabby.

31:23.182 --> 31:25.217
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:25.251 --> 31:26.318
You had a loss
of consciousness.

31:26.352 --> 31:28.487
We're taking you
to the hospital.

31:28.520 --> 31:30.622
Oh, no,
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

31:30.656 --> 31:32.424
It's a bump.

31:32.458 --> 31:35.627
Please let me go home.

31:35.661 --> 31:38.264
- I put the drugs back.

31:45.471 --> 31:49.108
- I'm not sure.

31:49.141 --> 31:50.509
- Hey, Brett,
let's get her inside.

31:50.542 --> 31:53.345
- Okay, one sec.
- Um...

31:53.379 --> 31:56.648
- They weren't for me.

31:56.682 --> 31:59.318
- Okay.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.526
- Otis, why am
I getting an alert

32:07.559 --> 32:10.396
for a $2,000 charge to the
Molly's checking account?

32:10.429 --> 32:12.364
What did Cruz
talk you into this time?

32:12.398 --> 32:15.701
- It was my idea.
A vintage Wurlitzer jukebox.

32:15.734 --> 32:18.470
For Molly's North.

32:18.504 --> 32:20.572
- Point person.

32:24.710 --> 32:26.212
- Hey, you going
to this Molly's North

32:26.245 --> 32:27.279
thing tonight, Chief?

32:27.313 --> 32:28.514
Sounds like Otis needs

32:28.547 --> 32:31.317
all the warm bodies
he can get.

32:31.350 --> 32:33.685
- I think I will, Mouch.

32:33.719 --> 32:36.455
Think I might
bring a friend along.

32:46.698 --> 32:48.567
- Hi.
- Hey.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.569
Uh, I got some beer.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.704
Blackhawks are on,
I figured we'd order in

32:52.738 --> 32:54.506
but it looks like you have...

32:55.674 --> 32:56.708
Plans.

32:56.742 --> 32:59.378
- Yeah, I am going out

32:59.411 --> 33:02.314
with that radio guy, Mitch.

33:02.348 --> 33:04.216
- That's cool.

33:04.250 --> 33:07.419
- Yeah, but, uh, rain check
on the Blackhawks.

33:07.453 --> 33:11.390
- Yeah, well, there's
82 games a season, so...

33:11.423 --> 33:12.724
- Good night.

33:12.758 --> 33:17.729
*

33:25.637 --> 33:27.206
- Now we're talking.

33:27.239 --> 33:28.807
*

33:28.840 --> 33:31.743
- Hey.

33:31.777 --> 33:35.247
- Well, we did it.
We opened.

33:35.281 --> 33:38.217
Crowd could be a bit bigger.
- Eh.

33:38.250 --> 33:41.620
The important thing is
you got to buy Lily a jukebox.

33:41.653 --> 33:43.689
- Yeah.

33:43.722 --> 33:45.224
- Herrmann, that's for you.

33:45.257 --> 33:47.326
- What do I want
with a Wurlitzer?

33:47.359 --> 33:49.361
- You always said,
Molly's works because

33:49.395 --> 33:51.297
it's a neighborhood bar.

33:51.330 --> 33:54.366
A warm place
to hang with good people.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.368
This is the Molly's North
version of that.

33:56.402 --> 33:58.504
- * I'm leavin' here today

33:58.537 --> 34:00.372
*

34:00.406 --> 34:02.508
* The sun's goin' down

34:02.541 --> 34:06.645
*

34:06.678 --> 34:07.746
- Hey, hey.

34:07.779 --> 34:10.449
Nina.

34:10.482 --> 34:11.817
You both remember
Nina Porter, right?

34:11.850 --> 34:13.252
- Yeah, of course.
- Hi.

34:13.285 --> 34:14.720
- Nice to see you again, Nina.

34:14.753 --> 34:17.289
- Um, yeah.
- Got it.

34:17.323 --> 34:19.391
- Thanks for reaching out,
Chief Boden.

34:19.425 --> 34:21.460
At the hospital,
I didn't realize that

34:21.493 --> 34:23.762
you were the firefighters
that brought my dad in.

34:23.795 --> 34:26.298
I really appreciate
you being there for him.

34:26.332 --> 34:27.866
Thanks.
- Um...

34:27.899 --> 34:29.701
My interest in your father

34:29.735 --> 34:32.471
goes a lot deeper
than an electrical fire.

34:32.504 --> 34:33.872
Um...

34:33.905 --> 34:36.508
Must have been '74, '75,

34:36.542 --> 34:38.410
I'm just about old
enough for my father

34:38.444 --> 34:40.412
to take me
to the Checkerboard Lounge.

34:40.446 --> 34:42.548
- And, uh,

34:42.581 --> 34:46.418
his favorite act
is playing that night.

34:46.452 --> 34:48.887
Stoke Porter.
Um...

34:48.920 --> 34:51.423
my father and I,
we had a tricky relationship.

34:51.457 --> 34:54.726
We didn't see
eye to eye on much.

34:54.760 --> 34:58.530
But that night,
sitting up front with him,

34:58.564 --> 35:01.833
Watching him
soak up that music.

35:01.867 --> 35:04.403
The blues.

35:04.436 --> 35:07.839
I felt like I stepped
into his shoes...

35:07.873 --> 35:10.509
just a little bit.

35:10.542 --> 35:13.445
I understood him
a little better.

35:13.479 --> 35:15.681
Now my father,
he's been gone three years now.

35:15.714 --> 35:17.716
So, uh...

35:17.749 --> 35:21.353
if I close my eyes,

35:21.387 --> 35:24.923
I can still feel his arm
around my shoulder.

35:24.956 --> 35:28.460
I can still hear his voice
in my ear saying,

35:28.494 --> 35:30.929
"Look up there, son.

35:30.962 --> 35:33.165
"He gets it.

35:33.199 --> 35:35.567
That's Stoke."

35:38.604 --> 35:40.806
*

35:40.839 --> 35:43.575
That's what your father
did for me.

35:43.609 --> 35:49.648
*

35:50.782 --> 35:54.620
So, uh--so we're
gonna drink to him now.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.888
Come on, everybody.

35:56.922 --> 35:58.757
- To Stoke.
both: To Stoke.

35:58.790 --> 36:00.726
- To Stoke.

36:05.897 --> 36:07.766
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:07.799 --> 36:09.635
- Should have held off and
planned this a little better,

36:09.668 --> 36:12.471
sorry about that.

36:14.005 --> 36:17.509
This place hasn't seen a crowd
this big in 10 years.

36:17.543 --> 36:20.212
At least.

36:20.246 --> 36:21.880
This is going to work, Brian.

36:23.549 --> 36:24.816
- Mm-hm.

36:27.853 --> 36:34.926
*

36:41.800 --> 36:43.602
- Hey.

36:43.635 --> 36:44.936
Hey.

36:44.970 --> 36:47.539
- I didn't know
you were going to be here.

36:47.573 --> 36:49.741
- I was just going to
say the same thing.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.812
- It's a big crowd.

36:53.845 --> 36:55.847
Yeah.

36:56.848 --> 36:59.651
That's bad.

37:02.020 --> 37:04.756
- It's good for business,
I guess.

37:04.790 --> 37:07.426
I'm just...

37:07.459 --> 37:10.262
not in the mood
for a crowd.

37:10.296 --> 37:11.997
- Oh.

37:12.030 --> 37:14.800
*

37:14.833 --> 37:18.937
Maybe something more quiet?

37:18.970 --> 37:20.772
- Yeah.

37:20.806 --> 37:23.542
That sounds good.

37:23.575 --> 37:29.047
*

37:45.030 --> 37:48.634
- Mmm.
* Gabriella

37:48.667 --> 37:50.736
- Hey Dad.
- Hey.

37:51.036 --> 37:52.738
Hmm.

37:59.678 --> 38:02.013
- Oh, yeah.
You look good.

38:02.047 --> 38:04.316
- I am.

38:04.350 --> 38:08.487
Nurse Maggie,
she snuck me a meatball sub...

38:08.520 --> 38:10.088
- And Dr. Rhodes says that

38:10.121 --> 38:11.790
I can go home tomorrow.

38:11.823 --> 38:14.693
- That's great.
I'll be here to take you.

38:14.726 --> 38:17.896
Uh, sorry
I didn't stop by yesterday.

38:19.898 --> 38:21.900
- You don't look happy.

38:21.933 --> 38:23.902
- I am happy.
For you.

38:23.935 --> 38:27.606
- Mmmm, no,
there's something wrong.

38:27.639 --> 38:30.542
I'm your father,
I can tell.

38:33.579 --> 38:34.946
*

38:34.980 --> 38:37.716
- I just...

38:37.749 --> 38:41.720
wish I could have done more
to help you when you got hurt.

38:43.689 --> 38:47.659
Now, listen to me, Gabriella.

38:47.693 --> 38:49.561
Uh...

38:49.595 --> 38:51.930
You know, this little adventure
that I've been on,

38:51.963 --> 38:55.967
with all the reporters
and all this attention...

38:56.001 --> 38:59.104
Uh, I...
I know it's silly.

38:59.137 --> 39:01.640
- No, it's not silly.
You were a hero out there, dad.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.542
- No, it was just a moment.

39:03.575 --> 39:06.378
It was, like, a quick decision.

39:06.412 --> 39:10.682
I know that that
doesn't change who I am.

39:10.716 --> 39:14.986
Now you,
you're there for people

39:15.020 --> 39:17.589
even when
they're at their worst.

39:17.623 --> 39:19.090
Like me.

39:19.124 --> 39:22.027
You know, all last year.

39:22.060 --> 39:24.763
I was a mess.

39:24.796 --> 39:29.401
Your brother and your mother
wouldn't even talk to me.

39:29.435 --> 39:31.970
But, uh...

39:32.003 --> 39:34.706
you, my love.

39:34.740 --> 39:37.843
You were always there.

39:37.876 --> 39:41.112
That's who you are.

39:41.146 --> 39:43.114
You're the real hero.

39:43.148 --> 39:46.685
*

39:46.718 --> 39:49.588
My hero.

39:49.621 --> 39:56.695
*

40:15.213 --> 40:15.747
.

40:18.249 --> 40:25.657
*
