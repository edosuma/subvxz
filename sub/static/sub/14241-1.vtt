01:46.807 --> 01:50.436
Tyler, just stop it.
I haven't got time to muck around.

01:50.527 --> 01:51.755
Tyler!

01:52.447 --> 01:55.598
All right! I'll just leave you there.
Is that what you want?

01:55.687 --> 01:57.564
-If I leave you in the middle of town?
-MAN: Suzette!

01:57.647 --> 01:58.716
Suzette, we're going to be late.

01:59.527 --> 02:02.485
Suzette! Stop it.
You're just looking silly.

02:02.567 --> 02:03.795
Do you want other people
to see you looking silly?

02:03.887 --> 02:05.639
If he gives you any more trouble,

02:05.727 --> 02:08.560
your dad's going round
his house to punch his face in.

02:08.646 --> 02:12.083
I'll punch his bloody mother.
You got that, David?

02:12.447 --> 02:16.918
I've booked the car for 7:30
but I might have to leave it on standby.

02:17.007 --> 02:21.000
If Baxter starts talking he never stops,
so I can't guarantee what time...

02:21.087 --> 02:23.920

you're gonna be late.

03:17.287 --> 03:19.357
You were the one crying.
You were like a baby.

03:19.447 --> 03:20.641
-I seen you.
-Was not.

03:20.727 --> 03:22.160
-Was!
-Not.

No sea monsters!

03:55.327 --> 03:56.919
Ah! Still early.

04:11.847 --> 04:13.200

-Yeah.

I'll go and tell them.

04:59.487 --> 05:00.636
Sorry.

but he didn't make it.

Oh, that's a shame.

-It's very sad.
-Poor old Mr Williams.

05:11.327 --> 05:12.442
It's very sad, indeed.

05:12.527 --> 05:14.358
There'll have to be an autopsy

05:14.447 --> 05:16.517

05:26.447 --> 05:27.800
All on his own.

05:27.887 --> 05:30.526
We'd just keep an eye on him, you know.

05:31.567 --> 05:33.603
Well, I'm sure he appreciated it.

in the world.

05:52.567 --> 05:53.886
Of course you can.

And I'm sorry for your loss.

He thought we were together,
like a couple.

06:06.007 --> 06:06.996
He said, ''You two.''

(EXHALING) Ooh. Now, look at it.

06:39.087 --> 06:41.157
That's not human, is it?
Does that look human? No, it does not.

06:41.247 --> 06:43.841
It's just a hitchhiker he picked up.
Didn't kill him.

06:43.927 --> 06:45.565
Some say they're positively beneficial.

06:45.647 --> 06:47.877
They release endorphins
into the bloodstream.

07:05.887 --> 07:07.286
Whatever it was...

07:07.367 --> 07:09.198
That was mutilation,
I should report you.

Well, that thing...

There are bodies going missing.

07:24.047 --> 07:25.116
How many?

07:25.207 --> 07:27.516
This whole city talks about you.

07:28.247 --> 07:29.965
What bodies? Where?

07:31.287 --> 07:33.039
It started two months ago.

07:33.127 --> 07:37.006
Bodies taken down to the mortuary,
then the records just stop.

07:37.087 --> 07:39.555
Five of them. Five in two months.

07:39.647 --> 07:41.126
And none of them white.

07:41.207 --> 07:44.677
One of West Indian descent,
one African, three Chinese.

07:44.767 --> 07:46.041
All male.

07:47.727 --> 07:49.718
What was your name again?

07:50.127 --> 07:51.480

07:53.687 --> 07:56.247
-What do you think?
-NHS.

07:57.087 --> 07:58.679
Yeah, too much red tape.

07:58.767 --> 08:00.917
Sorry, but good luck with it.

08:01.007 --> 08:02.998
Don't... Look... Wait a minute!

08:34.886 --> 08:36.115
-See you.
-Sir.

08:56.767 --> 08:58.325
Oh, Christ!

08:58.407 --> 08:59.601
-Good morning, sir.
-Morning.

08:59.687 --> 09:00.676
Good morning to you, too.

09:00.767 --> 09:03.122
Colonel Oduya for you, sir. Unscheduled.

09:03.207 --> 09:05.641
I'd remind you, you've got
a category meeting at quarter past.

09:05.727 --> 09:08.878
-You'd better come through.
-Thank you.

09:10.527 --> 09:13.963
I'm late. I'm sorry.
Oh, my God! I'm really, really sorry.

09:14.047 --> 09:15.639
Good morning.

09:15.727 --> 09:17.922
-Bridget Spears.
-Lois Habiba.

09:18.727 --> 09:20.558
Right. This will be your desk.

09:21.607 --> 09:24.326
Just tell me it's something small.

09:24.407 --> 09:27.604
Tell me it's a meteorite
or a shadow on the moon.

09:28.367 --> 09:30.961
Just for once, tell me it's easy.

09:31.047 --> 09:33.163
It might be nothing, sir.

09:33.247 --> 09:35.044
But it's my job
to inform the government,

09:35.127 --> 09:37.925
even if it turns out
to be a false alarm.

09:39.287 --> 09:40.925
Then what is it?

09:41.567 --> 09:44.559
Children, sir. It's the children.

09:45.927 --> 09:46.803
You are going to get us killed.

09:46.887 --> 09:50.800
No, you get killed, not me.
You die like a dog, like an ugly dog.

09:50.887 --> 09:52.798
Oi, Chuckle Brothers.
Think I've found something.

09:52.887 --> 09:54.718
Yeah, well, I want you to do a check
on St Helen's Hospital,

09:54.807 --> 09:55.842
specifically the morgue.

09:55.927 --> 09:57.724
Well, there's a computer.
Do it yourself.

09:57.807 --> 10:00.446
Meanwhile, I've been getting reports
of 1 7 road traffic accidents

10:00.527 --> 10:03.564
happening right across the country,
all the way from Glasgow to St Ives.

10:03.647 --> 10:04.636
Is that above average?

10:04.727 --> 10:07.446
Well, they all occurred
between 8:40 and 8:41 .

10:07.527 --> 10:10.837
Seventeen road traffic accidents
happening at exactly the same minute.

10:10.927 --> 10:12.883
And every single one of them
involving children.

10:12.967 --> 10:14.844
That'll be the school run.

10:14.927 --> 10:17.646
All of them were just
standing in the road.

10:17.727 --> 10:20.002
Not crossing the road, just standing.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.566
I saw it myself, Jack.

10:21.647 --> 10:25.003
Two kids on Market Street.
Well, they just stopped.

10:25.527 --> 10:28.485
But the accidents
are just one part of the picture.

10:28.567 --> 10:31.286
Because every other child
stopped at the same time.

10:31.367 --> 10:33.562
And not just in Britain.

10:33.647 --> 10:36.605
Same reports from France,
1 5 road traffic accidents.

10:36.687 --> 10:38.120
All timed around 9:40.

10:38.207 --> 10:41.085
They're an hour ahead,
so it was simultaneous.

10:41.167 --> 10:42.202
All involving children?

10:42.287 --> 10:45.438
Yeah, hold on, still cross-referencing.
Here we go.

10:45.527 --> 10:49.281
Reports coming in, RTAs in Norway,
Sweden, Denmark, Luxembourg.

10:49.727 --> 10:55.404
Germany, India, Egypt, Guyana.

10:55.887 --> 10:57.843
Spain, Portugal, Bosnia, Tokyo.

10:58.207 --> 10:59.481
Singapore.

10:59.567 --> 11:03.003
At 8:40 GMT, most of America was asleep.

11:03.087 --> 11:05.920
But even there,
I'm beginning to get reports.

11:06.007 --> 11:08.475
I think we can assume
it's all of them, sir.

11:08.567 --> 11:10.922
As far as we can tell,
at 8:40 this morning,

11:11.007 --> 11:13.726
every single child in the world stopped.

11:14.487 --> 11:16.205
Seen anything like this before, Jack?

11:16.287 --> 11:18.676
No way. Kids.

11:18.767 --> 11:20.246
Until we receive further information,

11:20.327 --> 11:23.000
we don't know
if it's extraterrestrial in origin,

11:23.087 --> 11:26.079
though the United Nations have taken
UNIT up to yellow alert, just in case.

11:26.167 --> 11:27.202
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

11:27.287 --> 11:28.720
Bloody hell.

11:29.687 --> 11:32.645
And, uh, Colonel Mace,
how is he getting on?

11:32.727 --> 11:34.399
He's fine.

11:34.487 --> 11:37.240
Wouldn't mind a post
in Vancouver myself.

11:37.327 --> 11:41.081
-Wonderful countryside, so they say.
-Nice for some.

11:42.887 --> 11:45.481
Sorry, my name's Lois. Lois Habiba.

11:45.567 --> 11:46.841
Just started today.

11:46.927 --> 11:51.205
I'm helping out Miss Spears while
they introduce the new computer system.

11:52.367 --> 11:55.325
-Thank you.
-All right.

11:58.087 --> 11:59.406
All done.

12:00.327 --> 12:03.603
What's his uniform?
That's not British Army, is it?

12:04.287 --> 12:07.802
If you could start transferring
the names and addresses.

12:10.807 --> 12:13.765
-You have two daughters, is that right?
-Yeah.

12:14.367 --> 12:15.766
Maybe I should get them
home from school.

12:15.847 --> 12:17.519
I'd be careful, sir.

12:17.607 --> 12:20.280
I wouldn't do anything
to draw any attention.

12:20.367 --> 12:22.642
Right now, this thing's random enough
to go unnoticed,

12:22.727 --> 12:25.799
and if anyone files a news report,
we'll be crushing it.

12:25.887 --> 12:27.843
But so far,
we're the only ones with the software

12:27.927 --> 12:29.280
clever enough
to piece this all together.

12:29.367 --> 12:32.120
Well, us and Torchwood.

12:32.967 --> 12:34.605
Do you want me to talk to them?

12:34.687 --> 12:38.202
They're a pain in the backside,
but they can be helpful.

12:38.287 --> 12:39.686
We're on to them right now.

12:40.287 --> 12:43.006
Okay, find out anything,
let me know, immediately.

12:43.087 --> 12:45.726
Of all the times
for Martha Jones to go on holiday.

12:45.807 --> 12:48.321
I get Sergeant Grunt.
I'm talking to a sergeant.

12:48.407 --> 12:51.319
Don't you dare phone her.
She's on her honeymoon.

12:51.407 --> 12:52.681
What did they say?

12:52.767 --> 12:55.645
UNIT base in Washington
has run some tests on a couple of kids,

12:55.727 --> 12:58.799
brain scans, blood sugar,
checking for radiation.

12:58.927 --> 13:00.155
Nothing.

13:00.527 --> 13:02.597
IANTO: You were right, he's back.

13:02.687 --> 13:04.405
(LAUGHS) I said so.

13:08.447 --> 13:09.846
Who's back?

13:11.727 --> 13:12.762
What's he doing?

13:12.847 --> 13:14.803
Waiting, just like you said.
He's been there 20 minutes.

13:14.887 --> 13:17.003
-Persistent.
-Good sign.

13:17.087 --> 13:18.281
-Dogmatic.
-Always a plus.

13:18.367 --> 13:21.245
Oh, Christ, never work with a couple,
you two talk like twins!

13:21.327 --> 13:22.806
Now tell me who he is.

14:18.767 --> 14:21.201
Three of the bodies were Chinese.

14:21.287 --> 14:24.199
-Were they related?
-No, one was 2 7 years old.

14:24.287 --> 14:27.723
And the other two were in their fifties.
But not from the same family.

14:27.807 --> 14:30.321
Bit odd, though, statistically.

14:30.407 --> 14:32.762
-In a city this small.
-That's what I thought.

I was buying clothes,

15:06.167 --> 15:07.441

15:53.807 --> 15:55.126

15:55.207 --> 15:57.323
'Cause she'd written
all these letters...

15:57.407 --> 16:00.126
She'd been a Christian all her life,

16:00.207 --> 16:03.165
and then alien life appears.

16:03.247 --> 16:06.922
She wrote this bit, she said,
''It's like science has won.''

her place in the universe,

16:15.607 --> 16:17.245
and it was tiny.

16:19.527 --> 16:22.485
She died because
she thought she was nothing.
