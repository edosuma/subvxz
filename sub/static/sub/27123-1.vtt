(bell ringing)

01:04.188 --> 01:06.816
And that's when I told my
mother that I didn't know yet

01:06.900 --> 01:09.068
if I would be bringing
someone to Christmas dinner.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.196
Well, our bad guy is kinda cute.

01:11.279 --> 01:12.572
Maybe you should ask him
out to Christmas dinner.

01:12.655 --> 01:15.241
Ha! Yeah, she'd love that.
The first time I bring a date

01:15.325 --> 01:17.368
to Christmas and he's a
two-bit counterfeiter.

01:17.452 --> 01:18.453
Hey, at least he
has the money

01:18.536 --> 01:19.704
for a nice
bottle of wine.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.040
We've been here over an hour.

01:22.123 --> 01:23.750
Any longer and I
might buy a tree.

01:23.833 --> 01:26.377
Don't you already have two in
that tiny apartment of yours?

01:26.461 --> 01:28.338
Right, maybe I'll get you one.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.256
Do you prefer the White
Pine or the White Spruce?

01:30.340 --> 01:31.674
Which one's which?

01:31.758 --> 01:34.302
It's easy, pine trees bear
needles in groups of two to five

01:34.385 --> 01:37.388
and they tend to be longer. So they're harder to decorate

01:37.472 --> 01:38.848
but gives you fuller
look in the end.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.517
Why do you know so much
about Christmas trees?

01:40.600 --> 01:42.727
Ah, because Christmas is
the best time of year

01:42.811 --> 01:44.771
and the tree is the
best part of Christmas.

01:44.854 --> 01:47.023
You're almost as
bad as your mom.

01:47.106 --> 01:50.819
(big sigh)I just want
our buyer to show up

01:50.902 --> 01:52.529

a few more minutes.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.290
Our guy's about to bail.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.959
What do you want
to do here Reid?

02:06.042 --> 02:07.126
Stall him, Mack.

02:07.210 --> 02:09.211
We need him to stick around
until the buyer shows up.

02:09.294 --> 02:11.047
Okay, any ideas genius?

02:11.131 --> 02:12.340
Tell her to
flirt with him.

02:12.423 --> 02:13.758
Ah, that's not
a good idea.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.260
What did you say?

02:15.343 --> 02:17.387
Oh, nothing. Brian
had a terrible idea.

02:17.470 --> 02:18.847
Yeah, well come up
with something better.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.265
Our guy's about to leave.

02:20.348 --> 02:21.891
I'm telling you, have her
flirt with the guy until

02:21.975 --> 02:23.309
the buyer gets here.

02:23.393 --> 02:24.936
(Mack) We need
to hurry guys.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.897
Okay, Mack -
flirt with him.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.732
What?

02:29.816 --> 02:31.442
That's right, we think
you should flirt with him

02:31.526 --> 02:32.902
until the buyer shows up.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.737
Seriously, that's your plan?

02:34.821 --> 02:36.364
Well actually
it's Brian's idea.

02:36.447 --> 02:38.241
I think it's a
horrible plan.

02:38.324 --> 02:40.243
Because it is a horrible plan.

02:40.326 --> 02:42.579
I know you can
do this, Bennett.

02:42.662 --> 02:45.164
There's no way that
she can do this.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.583
Why is it such
a terrible plan?

02:46.666 --> 02:48.167
Because you have never
seen Mackenzie Bennett

02:48.251 --> 02:49.419
try to flirt.

02:49.502 --> 02:50.879
Come on. Is it
that bad?

02:50.962 --> 02:52.171
You ever seen the video
of the Hindenburg

02:52.255 --> 02:53.548

02:53.631 --> 02:55.133
Hey, I'm not Hindenburg bad.

02:55.216 --> 02:57.260
Really, what
happened to Peter?

02:57.343 --> 02:59.637
Again, bringing up
Peter? (big sigh)

03:02.015 --> 03:03.516
Watch this.

03:13.234 --> 03:14.736
Stop doing your sexy walk, Mack.

03:19.949 --> 03:21.200
Hey.

03:22.368 --> 03:23.703
What?

03:24.537 --> 03:26.372
Can I help you find a tree?

03:26.456 --> 03:27.957
Do you work here?

03:28.041 --> 03:32.211
No, but I do know a lot
about Christmas trees.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.215
Why?

03:36.299 --> 03:39.969
Because Christmas is awesome

03:40.053 --> 03:41.471

top lip, top lip!

03:49.020 --> 03:52.732
Maybe wink at him.

03:59.405 --> 04:00.823

04:00.907 --> 04:02.325
Oh, no he didn't.

04:02.408 --> 04:05.078
Excuse me? Did you
just call me ma'am?

04:05.161 --> 04:06.996
-No.
-Yeah, ya did.

-Wait, wait.

-You're a cop!
-No.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.190
Gotta be one of my best yet.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.151
Yeah Bennett, nice tackle.

05:18.234 --> 05:19.777
Ahh, my arm! You
broke my arm!

05:19.861 --> 05:21.904
Settle down. I didn't
break your arm.

Detective Charles, if you
don't have your report

05:47.096 --> 05:49.307
on my desk in an hour, I
swear I'll make you work

05:49.390 --> 05:50.892

05:50.975 --> 05:52.935
And I don't care how
cute your twins are.

actually mad at you.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.192
Get in here.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.578
You broke his arm.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.798
-We were... -Not
you, arm-breaker.

06:22.548 --> 06:24.759
What the heck happened
out there Parks?

06:24.842 --> 06:28.638
Well, a, ah, situation
arose where the entire

06:28.721 --> 06:33.726
mission, ah, hinged on, ah...

06:33.810 --> 06:36.646
I'm dying of anticipation here.

06:36.729 --> 06:39.690
Detective Bennett's
ability to flirt.

06:39.774 --> 06:41.400
Flirt?

06:41.484 --> 06:44.320
Yes, in order to keep the
suspect around for the drop,

06:44.403 --> 06:47.323
Mack suddenly had
to flirt with him.

06:47.406 --> 06:50.076
Good grief, she had to flirt?

06:50.159 --> 06:53.204
That sounds like a plan that idiot Brian would come up with.

06:53.287 --> 06:55.915
We're lucky he only ended
up with a broken arm.

06:56.290 --> 06:57.750
Okay that's enough.

06:57.834 --> 07:01.129
Mistakes were made, I
apologized, but we got them.

07:01.212 --> 07:03.339
Correction, we got one of them,

07:03.422 --> 07:06.342
and we're lucky he had the counterfeit money on him.

07:08.678 --> 07:11.013
How bad was the flirting?

07:11.097 --> 07:14.517
It was pretty bad ma'am,
a man's arm was broken.

friends have grandchildren

07:21.357 --> 07:24.068
and you can't even get a
date to Christmas dinner?

07:24.152 --> 07:26.320
My dog, Bunchy, has
more dates than you.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.656
Mom!

I am your Mother.

07:37.331 --> 07:40.751
Is it the shoes? It's
the shoes, isn't it?

07:40.835 --> 07:42.879
The shoes aren't helping
the situation Captain.

07:42.962 --> 07:45.464

07:45.548 --> 07:47.008
There must be
something we can do.

the woman some hope.

off my gift early this year.

11:05.664 --> 11:07.583

11:09.210 --> 11:11.087
It's work. I
gotta take this.

11:11.170 --> 11:14.090
Hurry back. The young
one here works fast.

11:14.173 --> 11:17.426
(Mack) Yes, the force is

'Cause I want to marry you.

at the coffee shop?

11:27.812 --> 11:30.856
(laughs) Great, it's a sea of hair gel and cologne in there.

11:34.151 --> 11:35.403
Just give me a second.

11:47.039 --> 11:48.457
Beautiful!

drooling over a guy?

11:51.001 --> 11:53.504

tree at the station.

11:53.587 --> 11:55.840

11:58.676 --> 11:59.885

Are you okay?

12:24.160 --> 12:26.537

No, I'm okay. Only
because you caught me.

12:30.958 --> 12:33.752
Ha, lucky timing. I'm sure there's a joke in there

12:33.836 --> 12:35.296
about you being a great catch.

12:35.379 --> 12:36.755
(Mack giggles)

12:37.882 --> 12:39.341
I'm Carson.

Hey Carson, I'm Mackenzie.

12:41.635 --> 12:43.512
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

You know, I'm on my way to
this Christmas singles' night

12:47.641 --> 12:49.768

12:49.852 --> 12:51.437
this is what I had in mind.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.980
(they both laugh)

12:56.817 --> 12:58.527
Ah...

12:59.069 --> 13:00.362
So you're into the
singles' night?

13:00.446 --> 13:02.573
Ah yeah, it was my buddy's idea.

13:02.656 --> 13:04.325
Um, are you here for
the singles' night?

13:04.408 --> 13:06.202
Yeah. No.
Well kinda.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.621
My friend Ken owns
the coffee shop,

13:08.704 --> 13:10.456
so just going to support him.

13:10.539 --> 13:11.749
Oh, so you're not single.

13:11.832 --> 13:14.627
No. I'm very single.
Just ask my mother.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.714
Is your ankle okay?

13:18.797 --> 13:21.050
I'm sure it's fine.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.219
'Cause you look great
in those heels,

13:23.302 --> 13:25.221
but they seem rather dangerous.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.723
Don't blame the heels. If you think I look good in them

13:27.806 --> 13:29.683
then they're doing their job.

13:31.393 --> 13:33.646
You're beautiful.
It's not the heels.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.775
(cell phone rings)

13:38.275 --> 13:41.570
Looks like someone's trying
to get a hold of you.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.280
I don't care.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.825
Can I tell you something?

13:47.618 --> 13:49.370
Sure.

13:50.037 --> 13:54.083
You ah, you have
glitter in your hair.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.419
Of course I do.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.213
It's so typical
of my dating life.

13:59.296 --> 14:00.422
Is this a date?

14:00.506 --> 14:02.383
No, no. I just meant...

14:02.466 --> 14:04.468
(cell phone rings)

14:04.552 --> 14:05.844
Shoot.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.764
Look, I was just kidding. Um...

14:08.847 --> 14:10.683
You know, running into
you tonight was more...

14:10.766 --> 14:12.851
Serendipitous
than anything.

14:14.144 --> 14:16.063
What did you just say?

14:16.146 --> 14:18.399
Serendipity, it means...

14:18.482 --> 14:21.610
(both together)
A happy accident.

14:23.445 --> 14:24.989
(text notification)

14:25.906 --> 14:28.033
Is everything okay?

14:28.117 --> 14:31.370
It's work. I'm sorry.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.502
Thanks for catching me.

14:40.129 --> 14:41.839
Anytime.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.100
(door slams)

14:55.853 --> 14:57.396
I hope this is important, Reid.

14:57.479 --> 14:59.398
-Counterfeit man.
-What?

14:59.481 --> 15:00.983
The other perp we
were waiting for

15:01.066 --> 15:02.943
at the tree lot,
we found him.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.487
Ugh. Just my stupid luck.

15:05.571 --> 15:09.700
Oh, no. You look so
nice. How'd it go?

15:09.783 --> 15:12.161
Well, it was going
amazingly well until I got

15:12.244 --> 15:15.164
a thousand texts
messages from, hm,

15:15.247 --> 15:17.082
let me see here... You!

15:17.583 --> 15:18.709
Counterfeit man!

15:18.792 --> 15:21.503
This is so ticking
me off right now.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.339
You wore heels!

15:23.422 --> 15:26.258
Yeah well, a lot of
good they did me.

15:26.467 --> 15:27.468
(Reid) That's him?

15:28.594 --> 15:30.262
(Mack) He messed up my
chances with the perfect guy?

15:31.430 --> 15:32.640
I got this.
(door slams)

15:33.015 --> 15:34.475
Just don't beak his arm.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.072
(Carson V.O.) Running into
you tonight was more...

15:48.155 --> 15:50.282
Serendipitous
than anything.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.409
(Mack V.O.) What
did you just say?

15:52.493 --> 15:54.578
(Carson V.O.)Serendipity, it means...

15:54.662 --> 15:56.455
(both together V.O.)A happy accident.

15:56.538 --> 15:57.748
(alarms goes off)

16:10.552 --> 16:11.929
Hi, I'm Mackenzie.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.056
Hey, I'm Mackenzie.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.474
They're not even
that comfortable.

16:15.557 --> 16:17.685
It's actually kind of like,
easier to walk in them.

16:24.983 --> 16:26.944
Take you down
to the station.

16:41.625 --> 16:44.420
Good job last night guys,
especially you Mack.

16:44.503 --> 16:45.879
You really showed some progress.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.841
Thanks Captain. I'm kind
of proud of myself too.

16:48.924 --> 16:52.886
I went out on a limb, wore
heels, talked to a cute guy...

16:52.970 --> 16:56.098
Detective, what are
you talking about?

16:56.181 --> 16:59.476
The coffee shop guy
I met last night.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.730
Well congratulations, but I
was talking about the perp

17:02.813 --> 17:05.482
you managed to apprehend
without breaking an arm.

17:05.566 --> 17:08.736
Oh. Thanks.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.821
But I'm glad you met a cute guy. Way to multi-task.

17:11.905 --> 17:13.866
In my office, now.

17:29.089 --> 17:31.550
Ah, this is Ms. Robertson.

17:31.633 --> 17:35.012
It's Special Agent Robertson, Captain. Thank you.

17:35.095 --> 17:38.474
Of course. This is
Special Agent Robertson.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.142
She's with the FBI.

17:40.225 --> 17:44.396
This is Detectives
Bennett and Parks...

17:44.480 --> 17:47.399
It's a pleasure
to meet you both.

17:48.358 --> 17:51.945
Special Agent, would
you like to sit?

17:52.362 --> 17:54.907
That's a lot of
Christmas trinkets.

17:54.990 --> 17:58.744
I prefer to stand.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.205
Agent Robertson,
what is the FBI doing

18:01.288 --> 18:02.748
in our little police station?

18:02.831 --> 18:06.502
Oh, the FBI would
like our assistance.

18:06.585 --> 18:09.087
Captain, doesn't your
precinct have rules against

18:09.171 --> 18:14.176
such displays of holiday expression? Religion and all.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.845
The Captain views those
regulations more as

18:16.929 --> 18:19.348
suggestions than hard rules.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.809
How can we help
you, Special Agent?

18:21.892 --> 18:24.770
Well, the FBI has been
keeping a watch on a

18:24.853 --> 18:27.022
person of interest for
almost a year now. Mr. Mills.

18:27.105 --> 18:30.818
He recently moved
to your city.

18:30.901 --> 18:33.445
A criminal moved to our city
and you didn't inform us?

18:33.529 --> 18:35.823
Holly Christmas pound cake!

18:35.906 --> 18:38.700
We're informing
you now, Detective.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.411
Last year during
the holiday season,

18:41.495 --> 18:43.288
Mr. Mills and his now ex-wife, known only as Bethany,

18:43.372 --> 18:47.209
lead a diamond heist
that went sideways.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.670
They made off with a
diamond encrusted reindeer.

18:49.753 --> 18:51.380
The ex-wife fled the country.

18:51.463 --> 18:56.093
A diamond encrusted reindeer? That sounds beautiful.

18:56.176 --> 18:59.388
Actually, it's horribly tacky.

18:59.471 --> 19:02.766
But it's worth just north
of three million dollars.

19:02.850 --> 19:05.894
And this Mr. Mills, why didn't he leave the country too?

19:05.978 --> 19:07.729
The FBI could never
prove his involvement.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.898
But we're hoping that a
stakeout might lead us to

19:09.982 --> 19:12.609
some new information and
possibly the reindeer.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.903
-A stakeout! -
Detective Bennett.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.489
If we find that reindeer, we
can prove his involvement.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.575
So why does the
FBI need us?

19:19.658 --> 19:22.536
You guys don't have your
own cameras and binoculars?

19:22.619 --> 19:26.790
The FBI is spread a little thin, Detective, terrorists and all.

19:26.874 --> 19:30.252
Besides we feel that a local law enforcement with local knowledge

19:30.335 --> 19:32.296
would help us out greatly.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.089
And why now at Christmas time?

19:34.173 --> 19:36.758
Well like most retailers,
jewelry stores sell a much

19:36.842 --> 19:38.010
higher volume of product, including diamonds,

19:38.093 --> 19:40.846
during the holiday season.

19:40.929 --> 19:43.724
The FBI believes that
Mr. Mills will either try

19:43.807 --> 19:46.101
and sell the stolen
reindeer, or even worse,

19:46.184 --> 19:48.687
get together his old team
and rob another store

19:48.770 --> 19:50.939
while there's
inflated inventory.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.108
If the FBI would
like our assistance,

19:53.192 --> 19:55.611
we would be proud to help.

19:55.694 --> 19:58.488
So, you want my partner
and I to spend the days

19:58.572 --> 20:01.950
leading up to Christmas sitting in a dark room with binoculars?

20:02.034 --> 20:03.619
Exactly.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.621
You are not to engage
with Mr. Mills in any way.

20:05.704 --> 20:07.623
If you or your partner
find any evidence of the

20:07.706 --> 20:09.917
diamonds, please,
call me immediately.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.251
Captain...

20:11.335 --> 20:13.629
It's our pleasure to assist
the FBI in any way that we can.

20:13.712 --> 20:14.880
Good.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.341
-Isn't it?
-Of course.

20:17.424 --> 20:18.884
Carson Mills, 32.

20:18.967 --> 20:20.552
All his information is
inside of these files.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.930
The house across from
Mr. Mills is for sale,

20:23.013 --> 20:24.640
but we have rented it for you.

20:25.557 --> 20:29.561
-Mack, you okay?
- Mm, hmm.

20:35.275 --> 20:36.568
(big sigh)

20:39.988 --> 20:41.698
You have the worst
luck, Bennett.

20:41.782 --> 20:43.575
I know.

20:44.201 --> 20:45.994
And stop looking
at his photo.

20:49.331 --> 20:52.626
-Ah, he is cute
though. -Right?

20:52.709 --> 20:55.462
Alright, we've got a job to do.

20:55.545 --> 20:59.216
Great. We're professionals.

20:59.299 --> 21:03.804
Exactly, law enforcement
professionals.

21:03.887 --> 21:07.599
Right. Now
what do we do?

21:07.683 --> 21:10.352
Well, Brian just confirmed
the subject is at work,

21:10.435 --> 21:13.355
so you help me unload the gear.

21:21.238 --> 21:22.698
So that's his place, huh?

21:22.781 --> 21:23.782
Yup.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.869
And this is us.
Home sweet home.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.414
Oh! We should
decorate inside too!

21:30.497 --> 21:31.665
Nope.

21:32.082 --> 21:33.208
It would help with our cover.

21:33.291 --> 21:34.626
No it won't.

21:42.843 --> 21:45.303
It's already decorated!

21:56.398 --> 21:58.692
Great. This seems to be
the best vantage point.

21:58.775 --> 22:02.529
We've got a clear view to
his front door, kitchen

22:02.612 --> 22:04.489
and what seems to
be his bedroom.

22:05.824 --> 22:07.034
Let me see.

22:14.416 --> 22:17.502
Bennett.
Bennett! Hey!

22:18.920 --> 22:20.630
How are we going to handle this?

22:20.714 --> 22:21.882
Handle what?

22:21.965 --> 22:24.926
Well you obviously
like this guy. A lot.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.636
Yeah.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.096
And now you want
to look through a

22:28.180 --> 22:30.599
telephoto lens
into his bedroom.

22:30.682 --> 22:34.728
Usually we arrest
people for this.

22:35.145 --> 22:36.521
We're not stalkers, Reid.

22:36.605 --> 22:40.108
We're law enforcement
officers doing our job.

22:42.694 --> 22:45.947
Too bad your dream
man is a suspect.

22:46.031 --> 22:48.992
This would be a great way
to learn all about him

22:49.076 --> 22:50.869
and help you date the guy.

22:52.704 --> 22:54.998
Well, after last night
I just figured he was a

22:55.082 --> 23:00.504
funny, smart guy who loves
Christmas and is a great cook.

23:00.587 --> 23:01.755
Oh, he cooked
for you, did he?

23:01.838 --> 23:06.593
No, I just figure
he's great at it.

23:09.137 --> 23:11.973
But now we know Mr.
Right's a diamond thief.

23:12.057 --> 23:16.645
Well the FBI said they could never prove his involvement.

23:16.728 --> 23:19.231
I appreciate it partner,
but the only thing worse

23:19.314 --> 23:21.399
than my inability to
flirt with a cute guy

23:21.483 --> 23:24.069
is my inability to
find a good one.

23:24.152 --> 23:25.445
Let's be real here.

23:25.529 --> 23:27.864
I'm never going to go
on a date with this man.

23:29.366 --> 23:31.910
(phone rings)

23:33.370 --> 23:34.746
Bennett.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.623
(Carson) Hi. Is
this Mackenzie?

23:36.706 --> 23:38.750
Speaking. Who
is this please?

23:38.834 --> 23:42.546
This is Carson. We met outside the coffee shop last night.

23:42.629 --> 23:45.841
You fell, I caught you.

23:49.928 --> 23:52.389
Hello Mackenzie.
Are you still there?

23:52.472 --> 23:56.935
Yes, yes I am still here.
So nice of you to call.

23:57.018 --> 24:00.063
I hope you don't mind, but after you left I asked around

24:00.147 --> 24:02.649
and your friend who owns the coffee shop gave me your number.

24:02.732 --> 24:05.652
He did! Great.

24:05.735 --> 24:08.113
I hope that was cool?

24:08.947 --> 24:11.366
Sure Carson, that's
totally cool.

24:11.449 --> 24:16.121
What else did my friend
tell you about me?

24:16.204 --> 24:20.083
Oh, not much else. He had to grab another friend of yours

24:20.167 --> 24:22.836
who was hitting on
one of the baristas.

24:22.919 --> 24:24.629
Seems about right.

24:24.713 --> 24:26.464
I swear, I'm not
some stalker.

24:26.548 --> 24:28.216
It's not like I know where
you live or anything.

24:28.300 --> 24:31.469
Hahaha.

24:31.553 --> 24:33.555
Listen, Mackenzie.

24:33.638 --> 24:36.183
I know it's weird, me
calling you like this.

24:36.266 --> 24:41.104
But I really thought we had
a connection last night.

24:41.188 --> 24:44.399
Me too.
It was, ah...

24:44.482 --> 24:46.568
Serendipitous.

24:46.651 --> 24:50.280
It was. I'm sorry I
had to jet like that.

24:50.363 --> 24:52.991
I know this is going to sound
out of left field, but...

24:53.074 --> 24:57.579
is there any chance
you'd go out with me?

25:05.170 --> 25:06.630
(phone disconnects)

25:08.215 --> 25:09.507
(recording device turned off)

25:11.259 --> 25:13.428
(Carson V.O.) I know this is going to sound out of

25:13.511 --> 25:15.430
left field but...
is there any chance

25:15.513 --> 25:16.806
you'd go out with me?

25:16.890 --> 25:18.558
And that's when I hung up.

25:18.642 --> 25:19.976
I didn't know what
the protocol was here.

25:20.060 --> 25:21.937
So how long have you
known the subject?

25:22.020 --> 25:23.521
I met him last night.

25:23.605 --> 25:25.023
Last night?

25:25.106 --> 25:28.777
At a singles' mixer her friend was throwing at a coffee shop.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.904
So you're single
then, Detective.

25:30.987 --> 25:32.822
You could say that.

25:32.906 --> 25:34.532
Look, I'm sorry. I
should have come to you

25:34.616 --> 25:36.076
as soon as I realized
who this guy was.

25:36.159 --> 25:37.285
Yes, you should have.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.329
But we only talked for
like a minute, not even.

25:39.412 --> 25:41.748
And Bennett realizes
that she can't pursue

25:41.831 --> 25:43.458
anything with this person.

25:43.541 --> 25:45.085
I wouldn't be too
sure about that.

25:45.168 --> 25:46.628
What?

25:46.711 --> 25:49.422
Detective Bennett, as
flawed as her decision was

25:49.506 --> 25:52.133
not to tell us, has
actually put herself in

25:52.217 --> 25:54.719
the unique position to
help the investigation.

25:54.803 --> 25:56.972
How?

25:57.055 --> 25:59.641
Detective, I'm ordering you
to go on a date with this man.

25:59.724 --> 26:01.017
Immediately.

26:01.101 --> 26:02.978
What?

26:03.770 --> 26:05.146
Aw man.

26:09.901 --> 26:11.278
This is crazy!

26:11.361 --> 26:12.612
Yeah, it is.

26:12.696 --> 26:15.448
-I mean, can she even
do this? -Yes she can.

26:15.532 --> 26:18.326
Think of it like date
boot camp, Bennett.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.495
I'll be guiding you every
step of the way and by the

26:20.578 --> 26:22.747
time we put him in jail,
just in time for Christmas,

26:22.831 --> 26:24.582
you'll have a
black-belt in dating.

26:24.666 --> 26:25.834
You're loving this, aren't you?

26:25.917 --> 26:27.585
I always love a challenge.

26:30.588 --> 26:33.133
Alright, so how
does this work?

26:33.216 --> 26:37.012
Well, when a man and a woman like each other very much...

26:37.095 --> 26:39.055
I'm serious!

26:39.139 --> 26:40.557
Think about it.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.350
You're going to have a
team of people helping you,

26:42.434 --> 26:44.728
watching your every move. You can even wear an earpiece

26:44.811 --> 26:46.354
and I will talk you
through everything.

26:48.273 --> 26:51.526
I'm not that bad
at dating, am I?

26:51.609 --> 26:53.069
Really?

26:53.153 --> 26:54.529
I'm a grown woman.

26:54.612 --> 26:55.989
Yeah, what about Myles, huh?

26:56.072 --> 26:57.949
Why do you always
gotta bring up Myles?

26:58.033 --> 27:00.660
Did his eyebrows
ever grow back?

27:00.744 --> 27:03.788
Yes.
I think they did.

27:04.831 --> 27:05.915
(door opening and closing)

27:05.999 --> 27:08.209
We've got a lot
of work to do.

27:08.293 --> 27:12.964
Hello! You need festive
Christmas mugs.

27:14.341 --> 27:16.259
Hi?

27:17.677 --> 27:20.472
Oh! Okay. Let's see.
What can we do?

27:20.555 --> 27:21.681
Umm...

27:28.355 --> 27:31.983
Mom, Mom! This
is so bizarre.

27:32.067 --> 27:33.818
I don't need your
help to date a guy.

27:33.902 --> 27:36.988
Really? How is that
young man's mustache?

27:37.072 --> 27:38.198
Has it grown back yet?

27:38.281 --> 27:40.450
Eyebrows. It was
his eyebrows.

27:40.533 --> 27:45.455
Really? I'm going to need therapy after this.

27:45.538 --> 27:49.501
Pumpkin, I know I'm your mother, but I'm also your Captain.

27:49.584 --> 27:51.753
And I'm sorry if I gave
you the impression that

27:51.836 --> 27:53.546
this was a choice for you.

27:54.547 --> 27:57.967
Fine. But no more of this "Pumpkin" stuff

27:58.051 --> 27:59.677
while we're working, Captain.

27:59.761 --> 28:02.680
-Good. Let's get to
work. - What's the plan?

28:02.764 --> 28:05.975
Well I have a gift
from our FBI friend.

28:06.059 --> 28:08.686
A warrant for
interior surveillance.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.064
Cameras inside
his house, really?

28:11.147 --> 28:14.859
Listen, you've been ordered to date this guy, he's dangerous.

28:14.943 --> 28:16.820
I'd feel better if
we had eyes on him.

28:19.697 --> 28:22.867
Really?
This guy?

28:23.868 --> 28:25.912
I want eyes on you
if you manage to get

28:25.995 --> 28:28.289
inside the house with him.

28:28.373 --> 28:31.543
That's crazy. Why would I ever be in there with him?

28:35.964 --> 28:42.512
Ah, well, when a man and a woman like each other very much...

28:42.595 --> 28:44.472
Mom!

28:45.098 --> 28:48.476
Listen, nobody expects you to
get that far with this guy,

28:48.560 --> 28:51.604
especially anybody who
knows your dating history.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.064
Reid!

28:53.148 --> 28:56.734
But just in case he invites you into his place for dinner,

28:56.818 --> 28:58.862
or to watch a movie.

28:58.945 --> 29:00.738
Fine.
Anything else?

29:00.822 --> 29:02.365
Eyes and ears apparently.

29:02.449 --> 29:05.910
This warrant includes a wire
tap for his home and cell.

29:05.994 --> 29:08.079
This should be fun.

29:08.413 --> 29:11.249
(phone ringing)

29:15.753 --> 29:17.297
(Carson)Hello?

29:17.380 --> 29:18.756
Hi, Carson?

29:18.840 --> 29:20.133
Yes.

29:20.216 --> 29:23.011
Hey, it's Bennett, ah I
mean Mack, um Mackenzie.

29:23.094 --> 29:26.848
Ugh, sorry, it's ah,
Mackenzie Bennett calling,

29:26.931 --> 29:28.766
my friends call me Mack.

29:28.850 --> 29:31.686
I'm glad you called, Mack.

29:32.312 --> 29:35.690
Ah yeah. Sorry about
the phone call earlier,

29:35.773 --> 29:37.692
my, my cell's been acting up.

29:37.775 --> 29:40.862
No worries. We've all
had bad cell days.

29:40.945 --> 29:44.782
Um, earlier you
were mentioning a..

29:44.866 --> 29:45.825
A date?

29:45.909 --> 29:47.952
Yup, that's the word
I'm looking for.

29:48.036 --> 29:52.207
Um, I would very much like to date, I, I mean go on a date

29:52.290 --> 29:55.460
if the offer's still open, I
mean I would if you want to

29:55.543 --> 29:57.045
if not I don't...

29:57.128 --> 29:58.505
Mackenzie.

29:58.588 --> 30:00.924
Would you like to have
dinner with me tonight?

30:02.842 --> 30:04.636
Yes.

30:04.719 --> 30:07.972
Great, should I pick you up,
or I can give you my address

30:08.056 --> 30:09.849
and you can stop by my place?

30:09.933 --> 30:13.102
Oh, it's okay, I know where...

30:13.561 --> 30:14.646
where...

30:16.022 --> 30:18.900
Where a good restaurant
is. We could meet there?

30:19.817 --> 30:21.277
Sounds great.
What's it called?

30:21.361 --> 30:22.820
What's it called?

30:22.904 --> 30:26.658
Oh, it's ah, the restaurant yeah, it's, um... Marco's.

30:26.741 --> 30:28.326
Hey I like Marco's.

30:28.409 --> 30:30.912
Well I hope you would
if you're suggesting it.

30:30.995 --> 30:34.791
Yeah, it's ah, it's Italian,
and they do this crazy

30:34.874 --> 30:37.877
Christmas-inspired menu
every December. It's great.

30:37.961 --> 30:41.673
Love Italian. And cheesy holiday-themed menus. (laughs)

30:41.756 --> 30:45.218
Me too. And it's
not far from you.

30:45.301 --> 30:48.888
How do you know
where I live?

30:48.972 --> 30:52.016
I don't, I meant it's not
far from where I met you,

30:52.100 --> 30:55.395
at Ken's coffee shop. I guess you live nearby? Maybe not?

30:55.478 --> 30:58.273
Anyway, Marco's is right
down the street from there.

31:02.443 --> 31:05.989
I gotta go now. Gotta
let you go, I mean.

31:06.072 --> 31:08.616
Okay, I'll see you at
Marco's down the street

31:08.700 --> 31:10.285
from Ken's tonight at 7?

31:10.368 --> 31:12.412
Okay, sure, yup,
gotta go. Bye.

31:12.495 --> 31:13.705
(call is disconnected)

31:14.872 --> 31:17.000
Wow.

31:17.083 --> 31:20.086
This might actually be
harder than I thought.

31:20.169 --> 31:22.547
That was like a master
class on how not to ask

31:22.630 --> 31:24.841
someone on a date.

31:24.924 --> 31:27.302
Don't worry Mack, we'll
destroy these files

31:27.385 --> 31:29.304
as soon as the
operation's over with.

31:29.387 --> 31:32.932
Don't be silly Detective Parks, you know we can't burn evidence.

31:33.016 --> 31:34.809
We'll have to keep them...

31:34.892 --> 31:38.354
And offer them up
for scientific study.

31:38.438 --> 31:39.439
Yup.

31:41.190 --> 31:44.527
(big exhale and sigh)

32:21.230 --> 32:23.816
Everything looks clear. Carson
should still be at work.

32:40.792 --> 32:41.959
(lock clicks open)

33:04.982 --> 33:06.859
What in Santa's
workshop is this?

33:07.819 --> 33:09.862
(laughs) Joy to the world!

33:10.405 --> 33:12.031
What? What do you guys see?

33:12.115 --> 33:14.826
You'll have to see this
for yourself Captain.

33:15.243 --> 33:17.829
I want cameras in the
living room, the hallway,

33:17.912 --> 33:20.373
the kitchen and the bedroom.

33:20.998 --> 33:22.917
Isn't this the most incredible thing you've ever seen?

33:23.000 --> 33:25.211
Kind of weird, for a
single guy, isn't it?

33:25.294 --> 33:28.756
No, it's sweet. I
mean, how could a guy

33:28.840 --> 33:31.092
with this much Christmas
spirit be a criminal?

33:31.175 --> 33:34.303
I'm not sure the two
are mutually exclusive.

33:34.387 --> 33:38.933
But I vote that it's weird
and doesn't work in his favor.

33:39.225 --> 33:40.852
Oh, you're just a killjoy.

33:41.602 --> 33:44.605
You know, you're worse than
that Special Agent lady.

33:44.689 --> 33:47.316
(Captain on radio) Why don't you two geniuses get to work?

34:01.998 --> 34:03.249
There, it should be on.

34:04.709 --> 34:08.129
Huh! Holly
Christmas kitchen!

34:12.717 --> 34:15.344
(tiny bells ringing)

34:18.306 --> 34:19.931
Okay. All powered up.

34:21.976 --> 34:23.770
Mack?

34:25.396 --> 34:26.563
Mack!

34:27.732 --> 34:29.984
We use to have these exact same
ornaments when I was a kid.

34:31.527 --> 34:32.862
You good Bennett?

34:34.530 --> 34:35.739
Yeah.

34:38.117 --> 34:40.161
Be careful. Don't
fall for this guy.

34:40.870 --> 34:44.373
What? No? What are
you talking about?

34:44.456 --> 34:48.668
He's the bad guy. I can't wait to throw the cuffs on him.

34:48.753 --> 34:50.129
Uh huh.

34:50.213 --> 34:52.507
I'm good Reid.

34:52.590 --> 34:54.801
Just watching your back.

35:05.812 --> 35:08.105
(door opens and closes)

35:10.441 --> 35:12.485
This is so not
a good idea.

35:12.568 --> 35:15.446
Don't worry, Bennett.
We'll figure this out.

35:15.905 --> 35:17.615
Are those overalls?

35:17.907 --> 35:19.367
Over 25 years in law enforcement

35:19.450 --> 35:21.702
and this may be my
greatest challenge.

35:21.786 --> 35:23.454
When I came to work today
I didn't know I'd be

35:23.538 --> 35:25.373
ordered out on a date.

35:25.456 --> 35:27.166
Well, you'd better shake
your reindeer tail,

35:27.250 --> 35:29.710
because it's less than
two hours until your date.

35:29.794 --> 35:31.045
Shoot. Where did the time go?

35:31.128 --> 35:32.213
(phone buzzes)

35:32.296 --> 35:33.881
I don't know. But you gotta figure out another outfit

35:33.965 --> 35:36.759
otherwise this operation's
over before it gets started.

35:36.843 --> 35:39.053
It's not that bad, is it?

35:39.136 --> 35:40.972
(hangs up phone)

35:41.055 --> 35:43.224
Jessica's outside.
You. In that car. Now.

35:43.307 --> 35:46.894
- Jessica's here? -
She has her orders.

35:46.978 --> 35:49.313
And I need you at the restaurant before the subject arrives.

35:49.397 --> 35:50.648
Make sure you keep eyes on her.

35:50.731 --> 35:51.899
You got it, Captain.

35:51.983 --> 35:55.736
Hustle people! This date is going to need extra effort.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.446
Oh, for Santa's sake!

36:08.499 --> 36:10.626
No! Uh, uh, back, please.

36:12.670 --> 36:15.756
Hey, this is... nice.
Yeah. Do a little turn.

36:18.509 --> 36:21.095
No. Honey, your
entire butt is out.

36:23.764 --> 36:26.809
Really? Okay, let's try again. Let's start over.

36:28.895 --> 36:31.272
♪ high energy music ♪

36:43.951 --> 36:45.536
Okay. Nothing's working.

36:47.371 --> 36:48.623
Ken!

36:49.582 --> 36:51.584
-Yo.
-Help!

36:51.667 --> 36:52.585
Ken. Fast. Which one?

36:52.668 --> 36:53.586
Which what?

36:53.669 --> 36:54.587
Which one? Oh, which top?

36:54.670 --> 36:55.963
For my date. Now.

36:56.047 --> 37:00.259
Oh, ah... White shirt -
classic, clean lines. Love it.

37:00.343 --> 37:02.970
But it's not a court
appearance, Detective.

37:03.054 --> 37:04.555
So... No.

37:08.893 --> 37:11.646
Oh! Where do you wear
that one? Sunday school?

37:11.729 --> 37:12.897
What are you, twelve?

37:12.980 --> 37:14.190
So that's a 'no?'

37:14.273 --> 37:17.985
That is a 'no'
seven days a week.

37:18.069 --> 37:23.074
Oh oh oh oh! Please! Leave something to the imagination.

37:23.157 --> 37:25.868
Oh, it shrunk.
But it stretches.

37:26.786 --> 37:27.995
That's another 'no.'

37:28.079 --> 37:29.372
Really? I've
always liked it.

37:29.455 --> 37:32.208
'Always?' What?
Since the late '90s?

37:35.419 --> 37:38.297
Whoa! Finally. Tell
me that fits you.

37:38.381 --> 37:39.548
Hands up, lady.

37:42.927 --> 37:44.136
Oh.

37:45.513 --> 37:47.014
No. That's the
head opening.

37:47.431 --> 37:49.016
Keep your hand
there, don't move.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.394
It fits!
It fits!

37:54.480 --> 37:55.690
Okay! Yes!

37:57.400 --> 37:59.443
Yay! We have a winner.

37:59.527 --> 38:01.195
Now go get your
jacket, the black one

38:01.278 --> 38:02.446
that I gave you
for your birthday.

38:02.530 --> 38:03.614
Oh, I love that jacket.

38:03.698 --> 38:05.074
(Ken) Oh thank you!

38:47.616 --> 38:49.076
Come on Mack.

38:56.792 --> 38:58.335
(text notification ringing)

38:59.837 --> 39:01.839
He just entered
the restaurant.

39:04.967 --> 39:06.218
You got your shoes on?

39:06.302 --> 39:07.803
Maybe if I didn't have
to check my phone

39:07.887 --> 39:10.056
I'd be able to get
dressed quicker.

39:14.018 --> 39:16.771
Excuse me. You dropped this.

39:19.690 --> 39:21.609
Nice. Nice!

39:33.454 --> 39:35.539
Okay, and... ready.

39:36.499 --> 39:38.834
Okay, okay, okay. Purse.

39:40.044 --> 39:41.170
Brush.

39:41.879 --> 39:44.757
Wallet. Lipstick.

39:45.966 --> 39:48.094
Okay, break a leg. I need coffee. Bye bye.

39:53.349 --> 39:54.642
Oh hey, can I
get you anything?

39:54.725 --> 39:56.977
-I'm good. Thank you.
-Okay just let me know.

40:03.776 --> 40:06.237
-It's about time! -Enough
with the texts already.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.906
You think I just roll out
of bed looking like this?

40:09.698 --> 40:11.826
How do I look?

40:12.284 --> 40:15.996
Better than expected.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.915
But you should get the
approval of the Captain first.

40:19.959 --> 40:21.544
How do I look?

40:21.627 --> 40:23.921
(Captain Bennett) Mackenzie,
you look beautiful.

40:24.004 --> 40:26.006
Thanks Mom.

40:26.090 --> 40:28.676
Parks?

40:29.301 --> 40:30.928
Ah, right.

40:31.762 --> 40:33.889
Would you do me a favor
and wear this tonight.

40:33.973 --> 40:36.183
It would mean a lot to me.

40:38.144 --> 40:40.771
Mom, it's beautiful.

40:40.855 --> 40:43.023
Is it a family heirloom?

40:43.524 --> 40:44.984
It's department issue.

40:45.067 --> 40:46.694
There's a camera in the locket.

40:46.777 --> 40:49.572
Parks and I need to have
eyes on you all night.

40:50.030 --> 40:51.073
Oh.

40:53.117 --> 40:56.453
And one more thing.
It's Captain.

40:57.496 --> 40:58.873
Let's go get this guy.

40:58.956 --> 41:00.249
Copy that, Captain.

41:00.791 --> 41:03.669
Look, Carson's in there, he's
been waiting for a while.

41:03.752 --> 41:05.629
-You ready?
-Ready.

41:06.422 --> 41:07.590
Wait! Wait.

41:07.673 --> 41:09.633
Put this in. We'll
both be in your ear.

41:12.928 --> 41:14.555
Okay, you really
need to hurry.

41:16.223 --> 41:17.433
You got this!

41:23.898 --> 41:25.482
(indistinct chatter)

41:34.825 --> 41:35.951
Hi!

41:39.997 --> 41:42.541
How's your connection, Captain? Can you see clearly?

41:42.958 --> 41:45.377
Oh yeah. This oughta
be interesting.

41:49.632 --> 41:51.592
You look beautiful.

41:51.675 --> 41:54.428
Thank you. You look
quite spiffy yourself.

41:54.511 --> 41:56.972
-Sorry I'm late. -No,
no need to apologize.

41:57.556 --> 41:58.807
I love this place.

41:58.891 --> 42:00.976
Yeah, lots of
Christmas spirit.

42:01.060 --> 42:03.103
Like I said, I come
here every year.

42:03.187 --> 42:04.939
Well, I hope you don't
mind, but I took the liberty

42:05.022 --> 42:08.692
of ordering some Cabernet
and some cheesy bread sticks.

42:09.652 --> 42:11.362
Moi, they are so good!

42:22.081 --> 42:26.460
You're doing great, Mack. Get him to talk about his ex-wife.

42:27.294 --> 42:28.587
Maybe it will lead
us to the diamonds.

42:29.713 --> 42:30.839
Good call.

42:31.465 --> 42:33.050
So Carson, tell me a
little about yourself.

42:33.133 --> 42:35.761
Ever been married? Kids? You're not still married, are you?

42:36.262 --> 42:37.429
Ah...

42:37.721 --> 42:40.557
Okay good, but in the future let's go one question at a time.

42:40.641 --> 42:41.892
(chuckles)

42:42.393 --> 42:44.728
No kids and no current wife.

42:44.812 --> 42:46.855
No "current" one?

42:46.939 --> 42:48.315
Ah, ex.

42:48.399 --> 42:50.609
(Captain) Good. Keep him talking. Ask him what happened.

42:50.693 --> 42:54.154
What happened? I mean, if you don't mind me asking?

42:54.238 --> 42:58.325
I never could figure that
one out fully but I have

42:58.409 --> 43:01.328
an idea, a theory,
nothing concrete, though.

43:01.412 --> 43:02.746
(Mack) Was she cheating?

43:02.830 --> 43:04.373
Have you tried the
cookies, Detective Parks?

43:04.456 --> 43:05.666
Oh!

43:15.509 --> 43:17.052
Oh yeah. Hmmm.

43:19.430 --> 43:20.597
(electronic blip sound)

43:25.686 --> 43:29.773
So fresh! Captain, you
have outdone yourself.

43:33.402 --> 43:34.570
Do you have any
napkins, Captain?

43:35.279 --> 43:37.990
Yeah, of course, I'll have the
SWAT team just fly some in.

43:38.073 --> 43:39.867
(chuckles)

43:48.792 --> 43:50.169
Do you think the
ex-wife was cheating?

43:50.252 --> 43:52.212
Was she cheating?

43:52.296 --> 43:54.798
(Captain) Why did she
ask about cheating?

43:58.302 --> 44:00.137
The cookies are
on the button.

44:01.138 --> 44:03.098
Ah, we didn't
mean to ask that.

44:03.182 --> 44:04.975
We didn't mean
to ask that.

44:05.059 --> 44:07.061
We?

44:07.144 --> 44:09.813
Sorry, I mean me. I
didn't mean to ask that.

44:09.897 --> 44:12.524
(Captain) The cookies were
on the button. Sorry.

44:12.608 --> 44:14.568
-Sorry.
-What?

44:14.651 --> 44:17.237
Sorry, I shouldn't be asking
such personal questions,

44:17.321 --> 44:18.822
especially on a first date.

44:18.906 --> 44:23.160
No, it's, it's, Mack. It's
okay. Look, I'm a big boy.

44:23.827 --> 44:30.209
Um. Was she cheating on me?
I don't know. It's possible.

44:30.292 --> 44:32.336
To be honest, I wouldn't
put anything past her, so.

44:32.920 --> 44:34.380
What happened then?

44:36.256 --> 44:37.633
She lied to me.

44:38.384 --> 44:39.593
I'm sorry.

44:40.177 --> 44:42.638
It's okay. Better I
found out when I did.

44:42.721 --> 44:45.599
We were only married for a
short period of time anyway.

44:45.682 --> 44:50.104
My friends really helped
me get through that time.

44:50.187 --> 44:51.980
Actually it was my friends
who encouraged me to go to

44:52.064 --> 44:54.316
the singles' night
at the coffee shop.

44:54.400 --> 44:56.026
Well now I really
like your buddies.

44:56.110 --> 44:59.655
Yeah, honestly, they're
a great bunch of guys.

44:59.738 --> 45:01.156
You have friends
like that?

45:01.240 --> 45:04.243
Yeah, um, Jessica and
Ken from the coffee shop.

45:04.326 --> 45:07.162
And two others
in particular.

45:07.246 --> 45:08.455
Good buddies, huh?

45:08.539 --> 45:12.793
They've always
got my back.

45:12.876 --> 45:16.880
You know, my friends reminded
me that life's short.

45:16.964 --> 45:20.884
You got to make the most
of it, take chances.

45:22.803 --> 45:25.013
It's amazing how
fast time can fly.

45:28.100 --> 45:29.435
Life moves pretty fast.
If you don't stop

45:29.518 --> 45:32.438
and look around once in a while, you could miss it.

45:32.521 --> 45:36.775
Did you just quote
Ferris Bueller to me?

45:39.486 --> 45:42.656
-Wow, I'm impressed.
-You should be.

45:42.739 --> 45:44.658
What's going
on here Parks?

45:44.741 --> 45:48.787
He just quoted an 80's movie and your daughter picked up on it.

45:48.871 --> 45:51.707
I thought it was
my connection.

45:51.790 --> 45:53.292
(Reid) No ma'am.

45:53.709 --> 45:56.503
Good Christmas, they're
meant for each other.

45:56.587 --> 45:57.880
I can't wait
to tell Bunchy.

46:08.432 --> 46:11.185
Thanks again for dinner,
and, um, lunch tomorrow.

46:11.268 --> 46:14.480
My pleasure. I'm just glad we had a chance to talk, you know.

46:14.563 --> 46:17.065
It's not everyday you find
someone as weird as you are.

46:18.484 --> 46:21.028
Wow, look at that.

46:21.111 --> 46:23.280
I have the same
figures at home.

46:23.363 --> 46:25.115
I used to have the
whole set as a kid.

46:25.199 --> 46:26.575
Actually, I
still have them.

46:26.658 --> 46:28.911
Well, all except for Mrs.
Claus, but I lost that one.

46:28.994 --> 46:31.788
Really? Mrs. Claus is
really hard to find.

46:40.672 --> 46:41.965
(loud banging from van)

46:43.800 --> 46:45.552
-Did you hear
something? -No.

46:45.636 --> 46:48.305
Really, something made a
noise from inside this van.

46:48.388 --> 46:51.266
It's a work van. I'm sure we just knocked a wrench or

46:51.350 --> 46:55.646
something off a shelf back there when you leaned in for a kiss.

46:56.480 --> 46:58.815
Speaking of that kiss.

47:02.945 --> 47:04.738
(intake of breath)

47:06.823 --> 47:09.159
I'm moving a
little too fast.

47:09.243 --> 47:11.161
I get it.

47:11.245 --> 47:13.080
Thank you.

47:14.665 --> 47:18.710
Well I'm up here, but where's your car? I'll walk you to it.

47:18.794 --> 47:22.464
Ah, that's okay. I... I'm
going to go say hi to Ken.

47:22.548 --> 47:24.258
You sure?

47:24.341 --> 47:25.801
Yeah, maybe grab a free coffee

47:25.884 --> 47:28.428
and talk about you
behind your back.

47:28.512 --> 47:32.474
Smart, beautiful,
you like 80's movies,

47:32.558 --> 47:34.685
and you have a hook
up for free coffee.

47:34.768 --> 47:36.687
I like where
this is heading.

47:39.481 --> 47:44.611
Well, say hi to Ken for me, and uh, try to make me sound good.

47:44.695 --> 47:47.781
You know like,
charismatic and stuff.

47:47.864 --> 47:49.449
You got it.

47:50.534 --> 47:52.703
Good night Mackenzie.

47:52.786 --> 47:54.788
I'll call you tomorrow?

47:54.871 --> 47:57.082
Can't wait.

48:14.349 --> 48:15.392
(door opens)

48:16.727 --> 48:17.769
Really?

48:18.562 --> 48:20.397
(Captain Bennett)Parks did it.

48:20.480 --> 48:21.523
(door slams shut)

48:23.942 --> 48:25.193
Oh! Hello!

48:27.446 --> 48:30.032
(Mack) Coffee,
yes. Good man.

48:31.074 --> 48:33.160
Cream or milk? Cream.

48:33.243 --> 48:34.661
And sugar! Hmm.

48:36.288 --> 48:38.165
(Mack) Everything
bagel? Really?

48:38.248 --> 48:39.625
We can work around it.

48:40.751 --> 48:42.002
Okay.

48:42.836 --> 48:45.172
Crunchy peanut butter. My man!

48:45.255 --> 48:46.757
Mack.

48:46.840 --> 48:48.508
Morning sleepy head.

48:49.676 --> 48:51.428
Anything to report?

48:51.511 --> 48:54.056
You snore like
a freight train.

48:54.139 --> 48:56.183
Anything on our boy?

48:56.266 --> 48:59.436
He got up half hour
ago, took a shower.

48:59.519 --> 49:01.271
Probably leave
for work soon.

49:01.355 --> 49:03.023
Anything else?

49:03.106 --> 49:06.193
-I made coffee. -Ah,
you are the best.

49:06.276 --> 49:07.986
But I drank it all.

49:08.070 --> 49:09.071
I hate you.

49:09.529 --> 49:10.947
-Blah!
-Blah!

49:12.324 --> 49:13.825
You've been up for a
while, I can take over

49:13.909 --> 49:16.370
if you want to get
some shut eye.

49:16.453 --> 49:18.372
No, it's okay.

49:18.455 --> 49:21.958
Why don't, ah, go make some more coffee, or go grab some?

49:22.042 --> 49:25.587
-You sure?
-Yup.

49:26.004 --> 49:28.215
You seem pretty
focused on that window.

49:28.298 --> 49:30.175
Just doing my job.

49:30.258 --> 49:33.136
So what exactly
is our boy doing?

49:33.220 --> 49:35.889
Don't worry about it.

49:36.973 --> 49:38.308
Let me see.

49:47.984 --> 49:50.320
Oh Mack.

49:50.987 --> 49:53.281
Just checking out his
Christmas decorations, huh?

49:53.365 --> 49:55.992
Yeah. They're really pretty.

49:56.868 --> 49:58.829
(computer notification sound)

49:59.955 --> 50:01.289
That's your computer.
Are you gonna get it?

50:01.373 --> 50:02.666
(computer notification sound)

50:14.052 --> 50:16.221
Good morning Detectives.

50:16.304 --> 50:19.599
Morning Captain,
Agent Robertson.

50:19.683 --> 50:21.768
Anything to report?

50:21.852 --> 50:23.645
Carson's just getting ready
to leave his place now.

50:23.729 --> 50:25.313
Looks like he's
going to work.

50:25.397 --> 50:27.983
You mean the "subject,"
Detective Bennett.

50:28.066 --> 50:29.609
Yes ma'am.

50:29.693 --> 50:33.029
I filled Special Agent Robertson in on the date last night.

50:33.113 --> 50:34.948
(Robertson) Oh, yes, thrilling stuff.

50:35.031 --> 50:37.159
Christmas wine
and bread sticks.

50:37.242 --> 50:38.702
They were delicious.

50:38.785 --> 50:41.705
I go to that restaurant
every year for that meal.

50:41.788 --> 50:43.665
Do I look like I
care, detective?

50:47.085 --> 50:48.545
Actually, I can't tell.

50:49.045 --> 50:50.630
Regardless, our warrant
won't allow us access

50:50.714 --> 50:53.467
to his workplace. I need more information on the ex-wife,

50:53.550 --> 50:55.635
and anything you can
get on those diamonds.

50:55.719 --> 50:57.053
Yes, ma'am.

50:57.137 --> 50:58.889
Ask him out on
another date. Soon.

50:58.972 --> 51:02.058
Today if possible and get me
something I can work with.

51:02.142 --> 51:03.685
I'll try my best.

51:04.352 --> 51:06.188
If you can't Miss Bennett,
I will pull you two

51:06.271 --> 51:08.899
from the case and find
detectives who can.

51:08.982 --> 51:10.484
Do I make myself clear?

51:10.567 --> 51:13.487
Yes ma'am.

51:13.570 --> 51:15.947
(off beep)

51:17.866 --> 51:19.075
She's pleasant.

51:19.159 --> 51:22.370
She doesn't have to be. She's in charge of the operation.

51:22.454 --> 51:25.707
-I know, it's just...
-It's just what?

51:25.791 --> 51:31.004
Does he really seem
like a criminal?

51:31.505 --> 51:34.090
Listen, if we don't get you on another date with him ASAP

51:34.174 --> 51:36.510
that FBI agent is going to
find him a new girlfriend.

51:36.593 --> 51:38.845
I know!

51:38.929 --> 51:41.556
Should I do lunch?

51:41.640 --> 51:44.810
Nah, lunch dates
are for friends.

51:44.893 --> 51:46.353
Good call.

51:46.436 --> 51:47.938
Coffee?

51:48.021 --> 51:49.356
Coffee!

51:50.106 --> 51:51.817
(Reid) And we know
the perfect place.

51:52.859 --> 51:55.403
Now wait, is he like a
murderer or something?

51:55.487 --> 51:57.739
No! It was
stolen diamonds.

51:57.823 --> 52:00.158
So he stole a
whack of diamonds?

52:00.242 --> 52:02.619
Or his ex-wife did. A
diamond encrusted reindeer

52:02.702 --> 52:04.329
and then she skipped town.

52:04.412 --> 52:06.331
And we still don't know
if he's involved yet.

52:06.414 --> 52:10.043
-Wow. That's crazy.
-I know, right?

52:15.966 --> 52:17.175
(Reid on earpiece) Alright Mack, he's coming.

52:18.969 --> 52:21.471
Okay, he's here.

52:22.639 --> 52:25.392
Remember, you cannot
let him know I'm a cop.

52:25.475 --> 52:27.269
Don't worry about me,
remember that summer I did

52:27.352 --> 52:29.437
Shakespeare in the
park? I got this.

52:29.521 --> 52:31.439
-Wait, what?
-What?

52:31.523 --> 52:33.024
-No!
-No what?

52:33.108 --> 52:35.026
-Hey Ken!
-Hey! Hi hi hi!

52:35.110 --> 52:36.778
Nice to see you again.

52:36.862 --> 52:39.197
Mack, you as well.

52:40.574 --> 52:44.828
Yes, lovely to see you
too. Again. (laughs)

52:48.832 --> 52:51.501
Carson, can Ken here
get you something?

52:51.585 --> 52:54.337
Just a coffee, please. Black.

52:54.421 --> 52:58.174
Okay! Coffee for the lovely
man. (they both laugh)

52:59.801 --> 53:01.344
That's a hint of an
accent, isn't it?

53:01.428 --> 53:04.806
No, he's just coming
down with a cold.

53:04.890 --> 53:06.266
(Ken clears his throat)

53:06.349 --> 53:08.685
He really should be at
home resting, but since

53:08.768 --> 53:11.479
he's here maybe he can
get that cup of coffee?

53:11.563 --> 53:12.772
Uh huh.

53:15.358 --> 53:17.110
He seems pretty fun.

53:19.613 --> 53:23.074
Did you tell him all
about our date last night?

53:25.285 --> 53:26.703
Remember Mack, you told
him you were going to the

53:26.786 --> 53:28.455
coffee shop last
night after the date.

53:28.538 --> 53:31.291
Yes, last night I came
here after our date

53:31.374 --> 53:35.003
and told my friends all
about you. That's right.

53:35.086 --> 53:38.506
Wish I could have been a fly on the wall for that conversation.

53:38.590 --> 53:40.675
Well you came out
looking great.

53:40.759 --> 53:43.470
I told them you were
charming, sweet and funny.

53:43.553 --> 53:45.305
So basically you just
lied through your teeth.

53:45.388 --> 53:46.848
(they both laugh)

53:48.558 --> 53:49.684
Here you go.

53:49.768 --> 53:50.894
Wow!

53:53.730 --> 53:55.023
That looks interesting.

53:55.148 --> 53:58.526
Si Senor. (coughs)
This is our famous

53:58.610 --> 54:04.407
Iced Christmas Snowflake Peppermint Mochaccino.

54:04.908 --> 54:07.077
Thanks. This looks
and smells amazing.

54:07.160 --> 54:08.995
What do I owe you?

54:09.079 --> 54:11.331
Don't worry, he'll
put it on my tab.

54:11.414 --> 54:12.999
There you go.

54:13.875 --> 54:15.961
So how long have
you known Mack?

54:16.044 --> 54:20.340
Ah... we met, ah, at
self defense class.

54:20.423 --> 54:22.759
Right? That's right.

54:22.842 --> 54:24.094
Sounds fun.

54:24.177 --> 54:25.929
Yeah, it was fun for me
and you know, Mack was

54:26.012 --> 54:29.140
brushing up on her
skills from the academy.

54:29.641 --> 54:31.643
Academy, what academy?

54:36.147 --> 54:39.109
-Ah space...
-Space academy!

54:41.236 --> 54:43.697
Ah yeah. I wanted to go to space
academy but I ended up spending

54:43.780 --> 54:46.783
the summer working at my Uncle's T-shirt printing company.

54:46.866 --> 54:47.951
Space academy!

54:48.034 --> 54:49.369
What? You wanted to
be an astronaut?

54:49.452 --> 54:50.954
Yup, astronaut.

54:51.037 --> 54:54.207
An astronaut? That is a believable cover Mack.

54:54.290 --> 54:56.876
But remember Ken, I never ended going to the academy.

54:56.960 --> 54:59.295
Yeah, I remember.
No academy. Yeah.

55:01.214 --> 55:02.424
I got to go.

55:10.348 --> 55:12.892
Hey, can I ask
you something?

55:14.019 --> 55:15.603
Yeah?

55:16.938 --> 55:19.482
Am I crazy, or did last
night just go really well?

55:21.276 --> 55:23.945
You're not crazy. Last
night was a great date.

55:24.446 --> 55:27.949
Detective, remember you're on a stakeout, not a date.

55:28.491 --> 55:30.910
Right. So last night my friends
were asking more about why

55:30.994 --> 55:32.495
your wife left you.

55:34.372 --> 55:39.127
Because you seem like...
such a great guy.

55:39.210 --> 55:40.587
Well, thanks for the
vote of confidence.

55:40.670 --> 55:43.882
But... I wasn't
always that good.

55:43.965 --> 55:46.926
Really? Bad boy?

55:47.010 --> 55:48.261
No nothing serious.

55:48.344 --> 55:51.973
Just a few things
as a juvenile.

55:52.724 --> 55:54.017
I had friends
who stole things.

55:54.100 --> 55:56.144
Radios, jewelry.

55:56.227 --> 55:59.105
I didn't steal anything
myself personally, but I

55:59.189 --> 56:01.691
knew guys who did, and I
knew guys who wanted to

56:01.775 --> 56:02.984
buy stolen things.

56:03.526 --> 56:05.195
So you fenced
stolen property for

56:05.278 --> 56:08.448
high school buddies
to make a few bucks.

56:08.531 --> 56:11.618
Long, long time ago.

56:13.369 --> 56:16.122
Did your ex-wife
like that about you?

56:16.206 --> 56:18.583
Maybe a little too much.

56:20.376 --> 56:23.630
Now it's your turn.
Ever married?

56:23.713 --> 56:25.590
Nope.

56:25.673 --> 56:27.842
I find that incredible. I mean someone as amazing as you

56:27.926 --> 56:29.260
has never been married.

56:30.011 --> 56:33.681
Well my friends would say
I'm horrible at dating.

56:33.765 --> 56:34.974
I'm always telling
people how I feel

56:35.058 --> 56:36.893
about them and putting
my foot in my mouth.

56:36.976 --> 56:38.895
I get it from my mother.

56:40.939 --> 56:43.066
Anything you want to
say, Detective Parks?

56:43.608 --> 56:46.236
(pretend cough)
No ma'am.

56:47.320 --> 56:48.363
Didn't think so.

57:01.751 --> 57:03.628
Oh no.

57:04.087 --> 57:05.380
What is it?

57:07.757 --> 57:08.967
He a friend of yours?

57:09.676 --> 57:10.760
Hardly.

57:13.221 --> 57:15.265
Okay. Then why is he trying
to get your attention?

57:16.808 --> 57:19.102
He was a, he was an
acquaintance of my ex- wife's.

57:22.272 --> 57:24.065
Get a shot of
that man's face.

57:26.317 --> 57:29.529
Do you want me to run
it through our database?

57:32.323 --> 57:33.575
No need.

57:34.951 --> 57:37.162
(Captain) On your toes Mack. That guy is David Sommers,

57:37.245 --> 57:40.290
a well known safe-cracker
in the business.

57:45.962 --> 57:47.338
Carson.

57:48.006 --> 57:50.049
Dave. Nice to see you.

57:50.133 --> 57:51.551
I doubt that.

57:53.052 --> 57:54.137
You're not Bethany.

57:54.846 --> 57:56.431
No, I'm Mackenzie.

57:57.265 --> 57:58.474
What brings
you here, Dave?

57:59.309 --> 58:02.270
Ah, I was just here
to see an old friend.

58:02.353 --> 58:05.315
I mean what brings you here
to this neck of the woods.

58:05.398 --> 58:10.987
Oh. Work. I'm here for work.

58:12.822 --> 58:14.490
Maybe you should get
back to that then.

58:18.161 --> 58:19.871
Is that any way to
talk to an old friend?

58:20.580 --> 58:22.498
David, we were never friends.

58:24.209 --> 58:26.377
Yeah. You're right.

58:28.463 --> 58:30.173
I was always better
friends with your ex-wife.

58:30.715 --> 58:33.134
Hey, is she in town, by chance?

58:34.177 --> 58:35.220
I wouldn't know.

58:36.512 --> 58:38.264
Now if you wouldn't mind, I'm
in the middle of something.

58:38.348 --> 58:40.183
Yeah, I see that.

58:42.560 --> 58:45.980
Look, I don't know this
Bethany, but she's the ex.

58:46.356 --> 58:48.274
We're on a date. Maybe
it's time you left.

58:49.984 --> 58:51.361
(Captain Bennett)Get in there Parks!

58:54.155 --> 58:57.075
You heard the lady. She asked you to politely leave.

58:57.158 --> 59:00.119
Now do I have to ask you
to leave, not-so-politely?

59:00.203 --> 59:01.287
Because I don't remember
that working out

59:01.371 --> 59:02.664
so well for you the last time.

59:08.711 --> 59:10.588
I'm kinda liking this
not-so-polite option.

59:10.672 --> 59:11.798
Can I get in on that?

59:14.384 --> 59:17.637
Like I said, just here to
say hi to an old friend.

59:21.683 --> 59:23.351
See you soon.

59:30.024 --> 59:31.484
So sorry about that.

59:31.901 --> 59:33.152
Oh, it's totally okay.

59:34.070 --> 59:35.530
You were kind of
tough back there.

59:36.948 --> 59:38.283
So were you.

59:39.659 --> 59:41.452
Listen Mackenzie,
I gotta go.

59:43.830 --> 59:44.872
Are you sure?

59:45.623 --> 59:48.042
Yeah, uh, I should
get back to work.

59:48.835 --> 59:50.545
Just say thanks
and goodbye to Ken.

59:55.466 --> 59:57.051
I'll call you...

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:08.855
What was that all about?

01:00:09.814 --> 01:00:11.024
I don't know.

01:00:18.072 --> 01:00:20.199
He wasn't big time by
any means, but he was a

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:22.493
safe-cracker, that
part I remember.

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:24.829
Which would explain
why Carson knows him.

01:00:25.621 --> 01:00:27.540
Okay, we don't know
anything for sure.

01:00:27.623 --> 01:00:29.250
It could all still
be his ex-wife.

01:00:30.501 --> 01:00:32.337
It's possible, but this
definitely does not make

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:33.546
him look good.

01:00:33.838 --> 01:00:36.632
Also, he said he was going
back to work but we tailed

01:00:36.716 --> 01:00:38.468
him back to his house,
in the middle of the day.

01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:44.182
Mack, I know you like him,
and maybe in another time

01:00:44.265 --> 01:00:47.143
and another place
something could happen.

01:00:47.226 --> 01:00:49.354
But I think Special
Agent Robertson's right.

01:00:49.437 --> 01:00:51.564
I think you need to separate yourself on a personal level.

01:00:52.231 --> 01:00:53.566
(computer pings)

01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:57.570
Great job team. This David Sommers character

01:00:57.653 --> 01:01:00.615
is exactly the type of information we're looking for.

01:01:00.698 --> 01:01:02.742
Thank you Special
Agent Robertson.

01:01:02.825 --> 01:01:04.911
Any other news to report?

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:07.622
We followed the subject
back to his house.

01:01:07.705 --> 01:01:10.917
And we picked up a call from the wire tap where Carson...

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.378
I mean the subject called
into work sick for the

01:01:13.461 --> 01:01:14.712
rest of the day.

01:01:15.421 --> 01:01:17.507
Good stuff, we have
him scrambling.

01:01:17.590 --> 01:01:20.802
We still don't know if he
was in on the diamond heist.

01:01:20.885 --> 01:01:22.220
Ma'am.

01:01:22.303 --> 01:01:23.429
Detective Bennett.

01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:26.140
He just ran into a person his
ex-wife used to work with.

01:01:26.224 --> 01:01:27.850
If this Dave guy used to
help her break into safes,

01:01:27.934 --> 01:01:30.395
it would only make sense
that Carson would've met him

01:01:30.478 --> 01:01:31.604
at some point.

01:01:31.687 --> 01:01:33.398
You're getting attached
to this Carson, I get it.

01:01:33.481 --> 01:01:35.233
But you need
to be careful.

01:01:35.316 --> 01:01:37.610
I just want to make sure
we keep an open mind.

01:01:37.693 --> 01:01:39.570
Well like I said, he's
scrambling and if we keep

01:01:39.654 --> 01:01:41.114
the pressure
on, he'll crack.

01:01:41.197 --> 01:01:42.949
-But... -But nothing
Detective Bennett.

01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:44.409
I'm ordering you to
go on another date

01:01:44.492 --> 01:01:45.827
with him as soon as possible.

01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:48.996
Ah, but Special Agent Robertson. What's the rush?

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.833
This Carson could
actually be dangerous.

01:01:51.916 --> 01:01:53.292
Detective Bennett, do you wish to step away

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:54.836
from this operation?

01:01:54.919 --> 01:01:56.170
No ma'am.

01:01:56.254 --> 01:01:57.547
I didn't think so.

01:01:57.630 --> 01:02:00.633
Now go on another
date with him. Fast.

01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:02.468
(beep as computer is turned off)

01:02:03.803 --> 01:02:05.304
Okay, well I'm going
back to the station.

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:06.931
Call me if this
guy does anything.

01:02:07.014 --> 01:02:08.516
-Yes ma'am.
-Yes ma'am.

01:02:22.447 --> 01:02:24.240
Be honest Reid.

01:02:24.323 --> 01:02:27.118
Am I crazy here or does he just not seem like a criminal?

01:02:27.201 --> 01:02:29.787
I don't know partner, they
come in all shapes and sizes.

01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:33.291
Usually not this
good looking but...

01:02:33.374 --> 01:02:38.296
Ahhhhh. There's gotta be something here we're missing.

01:02:40.339 --> 01:02:41.674
(computer keys clicking)

01:02:42.383 --> 01:02:43.926
Looks like your boy's
up to something.

01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:45.428
What?

01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:47.930
He's about to make
a phone call.

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:50.600
This late at
night? To who?

01:02:52.018 --> 01:02:53.478
(phone ringing)

01:02:55.188 --> 01:02:56.355
You.

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.236
Hello.

01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:05.072
(Carson) Oh, hey
Mackenzie, it's Carson.

01:03:05.156 --> 01:03:08.159
Sorry to call so late. I thought I'd get your voicemail.

01:03:08.242 --> 01:03:10.203
That's okay.
What's up?

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:11.621
I just wanted to
apologize again

01:03:11.704 --> 01:03:13.080
for leaving so abruptly today.

01:03:13.164 --> 01:03:14.207
Don't sweat it.

01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:15.791
No, it was rude of me.

01:03:15.875 --> 01:03:17.376
It's just seeing
that guy David...

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:20.922
It just brought up a lot
of bad memories, you know.

01:03:21.506 --> 01:03:25.134
Yeah, I can imagine. But
like I said we're cool.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:30.223
Unless you feel like
making it up to me.

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:31.557
I would love to.

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:33.267
Great.

01:03:33.893 --> 01:03:34.852
Mackenzie.

01:03:34.936 --> 01:03:36.229
Yeah.

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:37.688
Would you go out with me?

01:03:37.772 --> 01:03:39.732
Meh, I'll think about it.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.361
Of course, I thought
you'd never ask.

01:03:43.444 --> 01:03:46.739
Okay. Tomorrow
night. My place.

01:03:47.532 --> 01:03:49.659
Um, your place?

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:52.036
I'll cook you dinner.

01:03:52.745 --> 01:03:55.081
Uh - sure, that
sounds nice.

01:03:55.164 --> 01:03:58.042
Let me give you the address. It's 118 North Street.

01:03:58.125 --> 01:04:00.253
It's right by the old post
office, you know where that is?

01:04:00.336 --> 01:04:02.421
I think I'll be
able to find it.

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:04.423
Great, tomorrow at eight.

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:05.841
Great.

01:04:06.634 --> 01:04:08.219
(beep as call is disconnected)

01:04:08.803 --> 01:04:10.221
Well, this should be fun.

01:04:11.097 --> 01:04:12.306
Aw man.

01:04:37.748 --> 01:04:39.834
So you really are pretty crazy about Christmas, aren't you?

01:04:40.585 --> 01:04:41.627
Guilty.

01:04:42.378 --> 01:04:43.588
It's nice to find
another adult

01:04:43.671 --> 01:04:45.298
who loves Christmas
as much as I do.

01:04:46.299 --> 01:04:48.551
Actually, I went to my
storage unit once you accepted

01:04:48.634 --> 01:04:51.012
my dinner invitation so I could grab a few more decorations.

01:04:51.846 --> 01:04:53.389
I always save these
ones for last.

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:57.143
Wow, you have a storage
unit for your decorations.

01:04:57.226 --> 01:04:58.728
I'm impressed.

01:05:00.229 --> 01:05:03.274
Well I needed one for the move, and yeah, a lot of it is filled

01:05:03.357 --> 01:05:06.777
with Santa Clauses, Christmas trees, Snow Men, Reindeer.

01:05:06.861 --> 01:05:09.155
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.158
Yeah, Christmas just
brings back such great

01:05:12.241 --> 01:05:15.411
memories from
when I was a kid.

01:05:16.245 --> 01:05:19.540
I love it. And these really
are beautiful ornaments.

01:05:23.461 --> 01:05:27.757
Actually, this one right here
is pretty important to me.

01:05:28.716 --> 01:05:29.759
Why is that?

01:05:31.177 --> 01:05:33.179
When I was about nine or
ten my mom, she bought me

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:35.181
this "paint your own
Christmas ornament kit".

01:05:35.264 --> 01:05:37.308
And she helped me
paint this one.

01:05:38.934 --> 01:05:40.436
It's beautiful.

01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:45.358
No, it's not. But I put it up every year to remember her.

01:05:48.319 --> 01:05:49.362
Your mother passed away?

01:05:50.446 --> 01:05:52.698
Yeah, in my junior year.
It was a car accident.

01:05:54.867 --> 01:05:57.119
I'm sorry.

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:01.082
That's when I started
to get into trouble.

01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:06.170
But that's behind me now.

01:06:10.049 --> 01:06:11.509
Here's to moving forward.

01:06:12.385 --> 01:06:13.761
To moving forward.

01:06:27.066 --> 01:06:28.943
(kitchen timer goes off)

01:06:29.985 --> 01:06:31.445
-I should take a look
at that. -Uh huh.

01:06:32.071 --> 01:06:33.239
Wait here.

01:06:43.874 --> 01:06:45.251
Mack. I hate to
break up this party,

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:47.378
but you've got to
speed things along.

01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:53.134
How did your ex-wife
ever let you go?

01:06:54.927 --> 01:06:55.928
Maybe I'm a horrible cook.

01:06:57.263 --> 01:06:58.472
That's not it.

01:06:58.931 --> 01:07:00.516
I can tell by
your empty plate.

01:07:02.017 --> 01:07:03.936
No no no no. Don't let him
avoid the conversation.

01:07:04.019 --> 01:07:05.187
Keep pressing.

01:07:06.021 --> 01:07:07.606
But seriously,
I want to know.

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:15.281
Bethany was a firecracker.

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:17.199
A firecracker?

01:07:17.283 --> 01:07:18.492
She was exciting to be around

01:07:18.576 --> 01:07:20.661
and she liked to be
around me, at first.

01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:24.081
But...

01:07:24.165 --> 01:07:26.375
But I was trying to move
away from a certain life,

01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:30.463
and she was running toward
that life as fast as she could.

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:32.673
The criminal stuff.

01:07:35.384 --> 01:07:38.471
That guy from the
coffee shop yesterday.

01:07:38.554 --> 01:07:41.557
He and other people use to
hang around with Bethany a lot.

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:45.478
She was smart, too
smart sometimes.

01:07:45.561 --> 01:07:47.396
Okay.

01:07:48.564 --> 01:07:49.857
She'd tell them how
to steal things.

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:51.650
At first just here and
there, for the fun of it.

01:07:51.734 --> 01:07:53.152
She'd tell them how to do things

01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:54.695
without getting caught.

01:07:54.779 --> 01:07:56.280
Did she get in trouble?

01:07:56.363 --> 01:07:58.115
She convinced the guys
that they should try for

01:07:58.199 --> 01:08:01.577
one big score, you know
the kind you can retire on.

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:03.287
Sure.

01:08:05.122 --> 01:08:07.792
They robbed a diamond
buyer last Christmas.

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:10.336
They stole this diamond
encrusted reindeer.

01:08:10.419 --> 01:08:12.797
One or two of the
guys got caught.

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.256
David obviously didn't.

01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:17.343
And your ex-wife?

01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:21.971
She just left.

01:08:23.974 --> 01:08:25.725
When things got hot, she
didn't call or write.

01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:28.770
She just walked away from me without even saying goodbye.

01:08:30.022 --> 01:08:31.607
I'm so sorry Carson.

01:08:36.069 --> 01:08:41.033
You know I ah, I never really
realized how deep she had

01:08:41.116 --> 01:08:42.993
gotten into that life.

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:46.287
I really didn't
know her at all.

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.626
Thanks for sharing
that with me.

01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:57.299
Well, you're the
first woman I've told.

01:09:00.176 --> 01:09:01.595
Actually you're the
first person I've gone

01:09:01.679 --> 01:09:03.555
out on a date with
since she left me.

01:09:04.223 --> 01:09:06.308
Really?
The first?

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:12.982
Well at the risk of sounding cheesy, I, I just didn't think

01:09:13.064 --> 01:09:15.484
I'd be able to trust anyone
else until I met you.

01:09:16.734 --> 01:09:18.571
Oh, stop it.

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:21.490
No, seriously.

01:09:23.283 --> 01:09:27.121
A woman as beautiful as you, who loves Christmas and my cooking.

01:09:30.707 --> 01:09:32.835
(phone ringing)

01:09:35.170 --> 01:09:38.841
I should answer
that. Excuse me.

01:09:45.723 --> 01:09:47.765
It's kind of late for a
phone call, guys. Who is it?

01:09:48.893 --> 01:09:51.103
We're not sure
Mack. Hang on.

01:09:55.733 --> 01:09:57.359
What's going on?

01:09:58.444 --> 01:09:59.695
(Captain Bennett) The wire tap's not picking up

01:09:59.778 --> 01:10:00.863
the call for some reason.

01:10:01.071 --> 01:10:02.072
Is the gear
malfunctioning?

01:10:02.156 --> 01:10:04.033
(Reid) No, the gear is fine.

01:10:04.116 --> 01:10:05.910
We need to hear what's
happening on that call.

01:10:22.801 --> 01:10:23.844
(door closes)

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.305
Sorry, didn't
mean to scare you.

01:10:26.764 --> 01:10:29.141
Oh, that's okay.

01:10:29.224 --> 01:10:32.144
It's a little late for a phone call. Is everything okay?

01:10:34.521 --> 01:10:36.065
It was Bethany.

01:10:36.148 --> 01:10:37.274
Bethany?

01:10:39.652 --> 01:10:41.237
What did she want?

01:10:42.029 --> 01:10:46.450
Oh, you know the usual, hey
how are you, happy holidays,

01:10:46.533 --> 01:10:48.869
how's the family, your
girlfriend's a cop.

01:10:51.497 --> 01:10:55.084
Brian! Have backup on standby
to go in and hold for my signal.

01:10:56.418 --> 01:10:58.837
That's crazy, Carson.

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:02.007
Don't! Because Bethany
is a lot of things,

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:04.551
but she's always right on
the money about this stuff.

01:11:04.635 --> 01:11:08.138
Ah, no, Carson, she's messing with you. I'm not a cop...

01:11:08.222 --> 01:11:11.600
Please don't, don't
lie to me Mackenzie!

01:11:18.357 --> 01:11:19.525
Okay, um...

01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:24.780
I'm a cop. A
detective actually.

01:11:26.782 --> 01:11:28.659
We've been watching
you for a few days.

01:11:33.914 --> 01:11:35.666
Why? This doesn't
make any sense.

01:11:37.001 --> 01:11:39.378
The FBI asked us
to do a stakeout.

01:11:40.295 --> 01:11:41.880
They think that you
helped your ex-wife steal

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:45.092
the diamond reindeer and
that you still have it.

01:11:45.175 --> 01:11:49.471
What? The diamonds?
The diamonds?

01:11:49.555 --> 01:11:52.933
But Bethany took the
diamonds when she left me.

01:11:53.267 --> 01:11:55.477
Well they think
you still have it.

01:11:57.396 --> 01:12:02.443
But when we met, outside that
coffee shop, how did you...

01:12:02.526 --> 01:12:03.652
It wasn't planned.

01:12:05.696 --> 01:12:07.239
We actually
met that night.

01:12:07.322 --> 01:12:09.408
And it really was
serendipitous.

01:12:09.491 --> 01:12:10.617
Oh man.

01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:15.039
And when they found out that
we met the night before...

01:12:15.122 --> 01:12:16.081
Oh please. Please!

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:19.293
They ordered me to go
on a date with you.

01:12:19.376 --> 01:12:20.669
But I wanted to.

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:25.507
I really liked you. And
I still really like you.

01:12:27.885 --> 01:12:29.261
They ordered you?

01:12:30.304 --> 01:12:32.014
I'm so sorry.

01:12:33.599 --> 01:12:35.350
Can you please just
give me a chance.

01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:44.693
Mackenzie, I want you
to get out of my house.

01:12:45.444 --> 01:12:47.446
Carson please.

01:12:47.905 --> 01:12:49.823
And I never want
to see you again!

01:12:58.749 --> 01:13:00.000
(door opens and closes)

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:03.545
Stand down Brian. She's
out of the house, safe.

01:13:05.172 --> 01:13:06.173
(door closes)

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:15.182
I'm sorry.

01:13:18.769 --> 01:13:21.563
(Mack is sobbing)

01:13:27.569 --> 01:13:30.030
Was that really that difficult? Was it? Really?

01:13:30.114 --> 01:13:31.657
A police officer! You
went and told the man

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:33.992
you were a police officer!
There goes all our dates!

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:36.286
There goes all
our information.

01:13:36.370 --> 01:13:38.747
Do you guys have nothing
to say for yourselves?

01:13:59.518 --> 01:14:03.272
♪ sad piano music ♪

01:14:26.128 --> 01:14:28.463
(sounds of electronic equipment being shut down)

01:14:38.473 --> 01:14:40.142
(suitcase closes)

01:14:49.985 --> 01:14:53.572
♪ sad guitar music ♪

01:15:03.248 --> 01:15:06.501
♪ sad guitar music ♪

01:15:17.262 --> 01:15:18.805
Still nothing
from him, huh?

01:15:18.889 --> 01:15:20.599
Can you blame him?

01:15:20.682 --> 01:15:22.059
Not really.

01:15:22.142 --> 01:15:24.603
What I did was horrible.
And even worse,

01:15:24.686 --> 01:15:27.522
I did it to a really nice guy who didn't deserve it.

01:15:27.606 --> 01:15:29.233
How's the FBI lady?

01:15:29.316 --> 01:15:31.151
Oh, she's super ticked.

01:15:31.235 --> 01:15:33.111
And your partner?

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:35.447
My mother put Reid and I
on administrative leave.

01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:37.532
(Ken) Oh. Do you
still get paid?

01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:38.867
Yeah.

01:15:38.951 --> 01:15:41.954
Oh, it's like a
paid vacation?

01:15:42.037 --> 01:15:43.789
Sure doesn't feel
like a vacation.

01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:45.624
I haven't slept in days.

01:15:45.707 --> 01:15:47.626
Well you do
look like crap.

01:15:47.709 --> 01:15:49.127
(they both laugh)

01:15:49.586 --> 01:15:51.630
(Ken) Why don't you
go get some rest?

01:15:51.713 --> 01:15:54.132
It's Christmas Eve,
I almost got fired,

01:15:54.216 --> 01:15:56.802
I hurt a guy I was falling for,
and now I'll never find anybody.

01:15:56.885 --> 01:16:00.264
I don't think I can sleep.

01:16:01.974 --> 01:16:05.185
Don't worry, I'll set
you up with someone.

01:16:05.269 --> 01:16:10.023
I appreciate it, but
it's a little too soon.

01:16:12.567 --> 01:16:14.444
So, you're closed
Christmas Ken?

01:16:14.528 --> 01:16:16.613
Thank goodness, yeah.

01:16:16.697 --> 01:16:19.408
But I'll come back anytime
to make you coffee.

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:23.412
-Thanks for the ice
cream. -Sure. Mowah!

01:16:42.306 --> 01:16:43.807
(Reid) Don't worry,
we'll be back on the job

01:16:43.890 --> 01:16:45.851
in the new year. Your
mom just had to put us

01:16:45.934 --> 01:16:47.519
on leave for the optics.

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:50.355
Yeah, I get it.

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:54.443
I know it's hard. Carson seemed like a nice guy but,

01:16:54.526 --> 01:16:57.195
try to forget about him.

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:59.865
Easier said than done.

01:16:59.948 --> 01:17:04.369
Administrative leave isn't that bad. It's like a paid vacation.

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:07.039
So I've heard.

01:17:07.789 --> 01:17:10.459
(dogs barking outside)

01:17:21.094 --> 01:17:22.220
No way.

01:17:22.804 --> 01:17:23.847
Is everything alright?

01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:25.390
Mack, what's going on?

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:58.173
(fingers snapping)

01:17:59.132 --> 01:18:01.259
Well done, coffee girl.

01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:05.305
Isn't that sweet? Running to rescue your new boyfriend?

01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:07.557
We're just dating.
It's kinda casual.

01:18:07.641 --> 01:18:10.936
Ahhh. Actually, to hear
Carson's point of view,

01:18:11.019 --> 01:18:13.647
it isn't even that right now.

01:18:13.730 --> 01:18:15.399
Typical new
relationship bumps.

01:18:20.946 --> 01:18:22.948
He said you were feisty.

01:18:24.699 --> 01:18:26.701
He actually
likes you a lot.

01:18:27.744 --> 01:18:30.205
Well and he hates you too.

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:34.334
Listen, I'm a cop. You
don't want to do this.

01:18:34.418 --> 01:18:35.794
Just let me call
an ambulance.

01:18:35.877 --> 01:18:37.129
Why would I do that?

01:18:37.212 --> 01:18:38.547
(footsteps approaching)

01:18:39.756 --> 01:18:41.716
Because Special Agent
Robertson from the FBI

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:43.385
just walked in behind you.

01:18:47.639 --> 01:18:51.685
That special agent?
That's my partner.

01:18:54.688 --> 01:18:55.981
Agent Robertson?

01:18:57.232 --> 01:18:59.317
She's not an FBI
agent, that's Bethany.

01:19:03.113 --> 01:19:06.867
Oh don't look so
shocked detective.

01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:10.662
David here is a great safe
cracker, but he's also

01:19:10.746 --> 01:19:14.541
one of the best document
forgers I have ever met.

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:16.710
Mack, run, try to
get out of here.

01:19:17.085 --> 01:19:21.173
Your mom, all it took was a phone call from the "FBI".

01:19:21.256 --> 01:19:24.092
A few forged documents and
that woman was so eager

01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:26.845
to work with me. I swear she would have fetched my coffee

01:19:26.928 --> 01:19:28.096
if I'd asked.

01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:30.098
Watch what you're
saying lady.

01:19:30.182 --> 01:19:32.684
Oh, don't worry. I'm only here for my diamond reindeer.

01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:33.935
Then I'll leave you,

01:19:34.019 --> 01:19:37.272
your mom and pretty boy
here alone forever.

01:19:37.355 --> 01:19:39.774
I don't have your diamond reindeer Bethany. I never did.

01:19:39.858 --> 01:19:43.737
You've had it all along darling. You just didn't know it.

01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:45.197
What?

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:46.948
You see, when the heist
went south, I knew I had

01:19:47.032 --> 01:19:48.867
to lay low for a while,
and I didn't want it on

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:50.869
me, just in case
I got caught.

01:19:50.952 --> 01:19:53.079
So you hid it somewhere
until things cooled down.

01:19:53.163 --> 01:19:54.915
Exactly.

01:19:55.457 --> 01:19:56.917
But Carson just
moved here.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.460
Imagine my surprise when
I went to our old house

01:19:58.543 --> 01:20:01.296
and found a lovely Korean
couple living there.

01:20:02.214 --> 01:20:03.965
You weren't very
hard to track down.

01:20:04.341 --> 01:20:06.301
But I still couldn't find
that one special object

01:20:06.384 --> 01:20:08.720
that I hid the
reindeer inside of.

01:20:08.804 --> 01:20:12.098
For a minute, I actually
thought he might have found it.

01:20:12.182 --> 01:20:14.935
So you figured you'd get
us to do your dirty work.

01:20:15.018 --> 01:20:17.103
She does catch on quick.

01:20:17.604 --> 01:20:19.189
So where is it then?

01:20:19.272 --> 01:20:23.318
Inside the one thing I
knew he'd never throw away.

01:20:27.155 --> 01:20:30.617
Little Carson made this for
his mommy before she died.

01:20:31.952 --> 01:20:33.828
(smashing sound)

01:20:40.919 --> 01:20:44.047
So Carson never had anything
to do with the robbery?

01:20:44.130 --> 01:20:46.299
Carson? Involved in
the diamond heist?

01:20:46.383 --> 01:20:49.427
Ha ha ha. He's an idiot.
The minute he found out,

01:20:49.511 --> 01:20:52.430
he made an anonymous
call to the authorities.

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:54.474
That's what spoiled
our getaway.

01:20:55.433 --> 01:20:58.979
Merry Christmas to us.

01:20:59.771 --> 01:21:01.940
(Carson) What are
you doing Bethany?

01:21:02.023 --> 01:21:04.734
Just finishing some
unfinished business.

01:21:04.818 --> 01:21:05.944
What's your plan?

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:08.446
Well, I was thinking of...

01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:11.825
Killing the three of you,
making it look like you

01:21:11.908 --> 01:21:13.952
all killed each other.
And find a beach somewhere

01:21:14.035 --> 01:21:16.288
and no one would be the wiser.

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:22.294
Well, thank you for finding
my reindeer for me.

01:21:22.377 --> 01:21:24.754
I appreciate it, but
they're playing my song,

01:21:24.838 --> 01:21:26.131
so I've gotta run.

01:21:28.383 --> 01:21:30.385
(Captain) I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

01:21:31.886 --> 01:21:34.389
We have a real good
view of this house,

01:21:34.472 --> 01:21:37.058
so trust me when I say,
you're surrounded.

01:21:40.228 --> 01:21:41.938
(gun clatters to the floor)

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:44.274
(Officer) Hands up!

01:21:47.068 --> 01:21:49.321
Behind your back! Let's go.

01:21:52.824 --> 01:21:54.034
Let's go.

01:21:58.079 --> 01:21:59.706
How did you
know I was here?

01:21:59.789 --> 01:22:01.875
A mother always knows.

01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:04.961
The back is clear.

01:22:06.588 --> 01:22:08.590
Well that, and your
partner called me.

01:22:09.257 --> 01:22:10.634
(sirens in distance)
Is he okay?

01:22:11.176 --> 01:22:12.344
I will be.

01:22:12.927 --> 01:22:14.804
(Captain) It sounds like the
ambulance is almost here.

01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:17.682
(sirens in distance)

01:22:23.063 --> 01:22:24.397
I'm sorry Carson.
It's broken.

01:22:27.025 --> 01:22:28.193
Not this.

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.363
That.

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:40.622
(sirens stop)

01:22:41.665 --> 01:22:43.291
It's for you.

01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:53.843
Here's the reindeer. Carson had nothing to do with it.

01:22:55.095 --> 01:22:56.471
(Reid) Would you look at that!

01:22:56.971 --> 01:22:58.765
I believe you Mackenzie.

01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:03.603
Well, I guess administrative
leave is over.

01:23:04.479 --> 01:23:07.857
So would you put this beautiful reindeer into evidence?

01:23:08.483 --> 01:23:09.901
Yes Captain.

01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:13.905
(Paramedic) Ready? Let's get him on the gurney.

01:23:13.988 --> 01:23:15.031
Okay, let's go.

01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:18.493
Well, are you going
to open it or what?

01:23:22.038 --> 01:23:24.874
(Carson V.O.) Mrs. Claus
is really hard to find.

01:23:35.927 --> 01:23:37.429
Go be with him.

01:23:38.471 --> 01:23:39.764
Yeah, we got this.

01:23:43.601 --> 01:23:45.186
Hmm.

01:23:46.646 --> 01:23:49.315
-Good taste. -Oh yeah.
I'd hang that up.

01:23:57.615 --> 01:23:58.908
-Hey!
-Hey.

01:23:59.951 --> 01:24:01.536
I can't believe you
found it for me.

01:24:03.371 --> 01:24:04.956
Well I knew it would
mean a lot to you.

01:24:05.749 --> 01:24:07.208
You mean a lot to me.

01:24:10.336 --> 01:24:11.671
(Captain) Bennett!

01:24:12.255 --> 01:24:14.299
Mom! What?

01:24:14.382 --> 01:24:16.968
Don't forget Christmas
dinner's tomorrow night.

01:24:17.051 --> 01:24:19.429
You have to bring a
present for Bunchy.

01:24:19.512 --> 01:24:21.181
He likes liver treats.

01:24:21.264 --> 01:24:22.640
And hats.

01:24:24.309 --> 01:24:27.645
And maybe you could
bring a date for once?

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:33.568
Carson, would you
like to go on a...

01:24:42.577 --> 01:24:45.079
(ambulance door closes)

01:24:46.305 --> 01:24:52.214
