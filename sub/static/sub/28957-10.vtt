Franklin Saint murdered my dad.

ANDRE:
This rock that you're selling,

00:21.255 --> 00:24.092
it's doing real damage
out there.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.660
LEON:
Once the rock get ahold
of they ass,

00:26.694 --> 00:28.362
the person you knew,

00:28.396 --> 00:30.231
they gone.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.999
TEDDY:
I don't know what it is
you think

00:32.032 --> 00:34.001
you know, but I'll
put you back in that cell

00:34.034 --> 00:35.403
any goddamn time I want.

00:36.604 --> 00:38.572
I didn't mean to kill Kev, Mama.

00:38.606 --> 00:41.509
I didn't mean to kill Kev.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.711
KEVIN:
You ain't built
for this shit, Saint.

00:47.548 --> 00:48.549
We sell it right here,

00:48.582 --> 00:51.051
in the hood, same as weed.

00:51.085 --> 00:52.220
I didn't invent this rock.

00:53.454 --> 00:55.022
But I'm-a blow it up.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.125
AVI:
I don't sell coke to kids.

00:57.158 --> 01:00.628
-Then what do you sell?
-I sell kilos
to people with money.

01:00.661 --> 01:01.962
Okay, front me a key.

01:01.995 --> 01:03.597
So you are after something.

01:03.631 --> 01:04.798
Fucking right.

01:04.832 --> 01:07.235
-And what's that?
-Freedom.

01:07.268 --> 01:08.602
Hey, come here!

01:08.636 --> 01:09.870
FRANKLIN:
Freedom from all of it.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.405
-(laughter)
-Watch out, man.

01:11.439 --> 01:13.141
MELODY:
Know when I'll feel free?

01:13.174 --> 01:14.942
(indistinct chatter)

01:14.975 --> 01:18.212
When I'm somewhere
far off from here.

PROFESSOR:
In physics, it's referred to

01:32.193 --> 01:36.997
as the many-worlds theory,
its roots in quantum mechanics.

01:37.030 --> 01:41.602
Simply put, if our universe
is, in fact, infinite

01:41.635 --> 01:43.804
and ever expanding,

01:43.837 --> 01:47.408
it means every possible
permutation of our reality,

01:47.441 --> 01:51.812
no matter how improbable,
must at some point exist.

01:51.845 --> 01:54.415
So, if you're failing
this class,

01:54.448 --> 01:56.750
don't beat yourself up too much.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.587
In another reality,
you're teaching it.

01:59.620 --> 02:00.988
(students laugh)

02:01.021 --> 02:02.856
Remember, exams Friday.

02:02.890 --> 02:05.293
Don't forget your blue books
and pencils.

02:05.326 --> 02:07.728
-(bell ringing)
-(indistinct chatter)

02:15.669 --> 02:18.005
So, who are you?

02:18.038 --> 02:20.974
In one of these
parallel universes.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.879
Probably back in Africa.

02:25.913 --> 02:28.282
My people never chained
and brought to this country

02:28.316 --> 02:29.783
to begin with.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.720
-ANNIE: Shit.
-(Franklin chuckles)

02:32.753 --> 02:35.022
Took your fun game and kind of
fucked it up, huh?

02:35.055 --> 02:38.326
(chuckling):
Yeah, yeah, you kind of did.

02:38.359 --> 02:41.795
What about you? This other life.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.697
The youngest senator in history,

02:43.731 --> 02:45.366
on track to be
the first female president.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.901
Well, you got to be at least 30
to be in the Senate.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.303
Not in that world, you don't.

02:49.337 --> 02:52.306
FRANKLIN:
Ah. Shame you're not ambitious.

02:52.340 --> 02:54.842
Show me someone around here
who isn't.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.511
The professors. I'm serious.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.647
They decided
to spread knowledge,

02:59.680 --> 03:01.915
instead of using it
for power or profit.

03:01.949 --> 03:04.184
We're the ones
you got to be afraid of.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.558
So, who are you in this life?

03:10.591 --> 03:15.363
Why? Trying to be friends
with the unicorn on campus?

03:15.396 --> 03:18.699
Or you got a thing
for black dudes?

03:18.732 --> 03:20.334
ANNIE:
Honestly?

03:20.368 --> 03:23.036
You looked interesting.

03:23.070 --> 03:26.840
Bet I do, to somebody from--

03:26.874 --> 03:29.176
I don't know-- Connecticut.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.445
I'm from Chicago.

03:31.479 --> 03:34.415
Oh, yeah? Which suburb?

03:34.448 --> 03:38.218
(scoffs)
Are you this tough on everyone?

03:38.252 --> 03:40.888
Or just white girls?

03:42.923 --> 03:45.826
("Break My Stride"
by Matthew Wilder playing)

03:48.329 --> 03:51.632
* Last night I had
the strangest dream *

03:51.665 --> 03:53.901
* I sailed away to China *

03:53.934 --> 03:56.036
* In a little rowboat
to find you *

03:56.069 --> 03:59.407
* And you said you had to get
your laundry cleaned *

03:59.440 --> 04:02.209
* Didn't want no one
to hold you *

04:02.242 --> 04:04.878
* What does that mean?
And you said *

04:04.912 --> 04:06.880
* Ain't nothing
gonna break my stride *

04:06.914 --> 04:09.483
* Nobody gonna slow me down *

04:09.517 --> 04:10.918
* Oh, no *

04:10.951 --> 04:13.454
* I got to keep on moving *

04:13.487 --> 04:15.456
* Ain't nothing
gonna break my stride *

04:15.489 --> 04:18.225
* I'm running
and I won't touch ground *

04:18.258 --> 04:22.062
* Oh, no,
I got to keep on moving *

04:22.095 --> 04:26.233
* You're on a roll
and now you pray it'll last *

04:26.266 --> 04:28.302
* The road beyond was rocky *

04:28.336 --> 04:30.838
* But now you're feeling cocky *

04:30.871 --> 04:34.274
* You look at me
and you see your past *

04:34.308 --> 04:36.344
* Is that the reason why... *

04:36.377 --> 04:38.579
FRANKLIN:
It's got to be in there.
This is what she said.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.247
She said it was a problem
with the loan

04:40.280 --> 04:41.982
and that it would all
be taken care of

04:42.015 --> 04:43.684
once the scholarship came
through and paid the loan off.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.118
Look, whoever you spoke to
was mistaken.

04:45.152 --> 04:47.488
This shows the loan
was canceled months ago,

04:47.521 --> 04:48.789
hence the overdue payment.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.257
Wait, why would the loan
be canceled?

04:50.290 --> 04:51.859
Your family's most recent W-2

04:51.892 --> 04:55.463
listed a reported income
of $111,000,

04:55.496 --> 04:57.264
making you ineligible
for financial aid.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.266
(laughing):
A hundred... I'm sorry.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.602
My mother earned $11,000
last year, sir.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.371
Well, not according to that.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.238
No, it's a mistake.
I promise you, sir.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.342
Do you have proof of that?

05:08.376 --> 05:11.545
I can get my moms to send
a copy of the W-2.

05:11.579 --> 05:13.146
You can call her right now.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.883
Your moms?
Do you have two of them?

05:15.916 --> 05:17.851
(chuckles)
My mother, sir.

05:17.885 --> 05:22.022
I can get her to ship it,
but it'll take a few days.

05:22.055 --> 05:25.959
Unless we have proof of
the error in the next 48 hours,

05:25.993 --> 05:27.995
you'll have to vacate the dorms
and drop your classes.

05:28.028 --> 05:31.231
It's just a mistake, sir.
Can't I get an extension?

05:35.436 --> 05:38.972
If our financial requirements
are such a burden,

05:39.006 --> 05:41.509
perhaps this isn't
the best place for you.

05:47.114 --> 05:49.483
Well, you know,
if you're too stupid

05:49.517 --> 05:51.251
to know a simple mistake
when you see one,

05:51.284 --> 05:54.455
then perhaps this ain't
the best place for you, sir.

05:56.524 --> 05:59.259
-Glenda, call security.
-Don't bother.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.295
I'll be back.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.166
It's just a mistake, sir.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.368
(sighs)
It's just a mistake.

06:09.403 --> 06:10.904
Damn.

wants to remain competitive
amidst the evolving landscape

06:28.989 --> 06:33.727
of America's racial makeup,
it needs to take a hard look

06:33.761 --> 06:37.798
at its admissions
and scholarship policies.

I thought a lot about
what you said the other day,

06:55.783 --> 06:58.652
about me being hard on people.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.654
And?

07:00.688 --> 07:02.790
Don't always think
I was like that.

07:04.492 --> 07:06.126
ANNIE:
What did you used to be like?

07:06.159 --> 07:08.128
Got some free time.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.097
Tell you over coffee?

07:10.130 --> 07:13.834
I would, but there's a recruiter
on campus giving a talk.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.937
-I was gonna check it out.
-Oh.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.907
What kind of recruiter?

07:19.940 --> 07:22.610
TEDDY:
Yeah, welcome.
And, uh, thanks for being here.

07:22.643 --> 07:25.813
Uh, right off the bat,
I want to start by just,

07:25.846 --> 07:29.082
uh, dispelling, uh, a few myths.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.451
Yeah, have a seat.
Uh, start by dispelling

07:31.485 --> 07:33.987
any misconceptions
that-that may be out there.

07:34.021 --> 07:36.990
You know, if you're here
because you have dreams of

07:37.024 --> 07:40.327
vodka martinis
and-and-and flashy sports cars,

07:40.360 --> 07:43.030
uh, I'm afraid the CIA
is-is not for you.

07:43.063 --> 07:45.132
Um, despite what Hollywood
might have you believe,

07:45.165 --> 07:49.136
it's a life of service
and-and sacrifice.

07:49.169 --> 07:52.773
And, uh, it's-it's not...
it's not usually very glamorous.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.508
It's rarely dangerous.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.209
It's mostly
pretty boring, really.

07:56.243 --> 08:00.981
But, uh, I can assure you
that it is absolutely necessary.

08:01.014 --> 08:05.052
Uh, the question
that I would ask is, uh:

08:05.085 --> 08:07.821
Do you have what it takes
to dedicate your life

08:07.855 --> 08:09.322
to something bigger
than yourself?

08:09.356 --> 08:11.191
Uh... (chuckles)

08:11.224 --> 08:13.861
You're not running for the door,
so I'll take it as a yes.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.063
We'll start by talking about,
um, the different kinds

08:16.096 --> 08:17.765
of career paths
that you can choose...

08:20.701 --> 08:22.570
FRANKLIN:
How you doing, sir?

08:22.603 --> 08:26.339
Uh, copy of the W-2, along with
the pay stubs, just to be sure.

08:26.373 --> 08:30.143
And, uh... and, uh, I just want
to say sorry for the other day.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.612
I was out of hand.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.182
I'm afraid I have bad news.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.885
The financial question
brought your scholarship

08:37.918 --> 08:39.720
to the attention
of our committee,

08:39.753 --> 08:41.855
and they're putting it up
for review.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.058
Up for review?

08:45.092 --> 08:46.694
What does that mean, sir?

08:46.727 --> 08:48.562
The Reagan Administration
budget cuts

08:48.596 --> 08:52.532
have thrown a number of
aid situations into uncertainty.

08:54.935 --> 08:57.337
Including mine, all of a sudden.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.073
They'll review your aid package
as soon as they can,

09:00.107 --> 09:02.109
but unless you have
the $7,800 you owe,

09:02.142 --> 09:03.543
you'll need to move out
immediately.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.412
What? You're kicking me out
right now?

09:05.445 --> 09:07.080
Well, it wouldn't
be fair to the kids

09:07.114 --> 09:08.448
who are actually
paying their way

09:08.481 --> 09:10.517

would it?

09:10.550 --> 09:11.919
Nah, fuck that!

09:11.952 --> 09:14.121
You got somebody else
I could talk to?

09:14.154 --> 09:16.123
You got a supervisor
or something?

09:16.156 --> 09:17.925
-No, afraid I don't.
-Huh?!

09:17.958 --> 09:19.927
'Cause this motherfucker's
obviously not listening.

as soon as they can.
-Huh? Fuck that.

It's already too late
to drop these classes.

09:24.932 --> 09:27.635
I don't finish them,
they'll be F's on my record.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.703
You know that.
You understand that, right?

09:29.737 --> 09:31.772
Yeah, that is a shame.

09:31.805 --> 09:34.274
A shame?

09:34.307 --> 09:38.145
This is my life, man.

09:38.178 --> 09:41.414
Don't you know how hard
I worked to get here?

09:41.448 --> 09:45.986
You pulled yourself up once,
I'm sure you can do it again.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.721
But if I were you,

09:47.755 --> 09:51.358
I might reconsider my attitude
moving forward.

My attitude.

-You did not do that.
-Right over the fucking desk.

11:43.904 --> 11:47.374
-Have you lost your mind?
-Maybe I did
in that moment, yeah.

11:47.407 --> 11:50.177
-(laughs)
-I ain't never been
that angry before.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.579
(dog barking in distance)

11:52.612 --> 11:53.914
So, yeah.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.715
Can't go back.

11:55.749 --> 11:58.151
Even if the scholarship
goes through.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.926
Hey. You'll be okay.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.028
Spelman? (scoffs)

12:08.061 --> 12:10.663
That'll be a totally different
experience, trust me.

12:18.171 --> 12:20.908
MAN:
Man, can you pass
that weed already, man?

12:20.941 --> 12:23.443
-MAN 2:
It's too strong for you, fam.
-Hey, pass that shit.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.212
(laughter)

12:25.245 --> 12:27.714
Here come the homey right here.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.217
Hey, what's up, poindexter?

12:30.250 --> 12:32.419
(chuckles) How about you hit us
with some of them equations?

12:32.452 --> 12:34.387
Nah, nah, nah.
Hook up some of them stock tips.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.056
-I'm trying to invest, boy.
-(laughter)

12:36.089 --> 12:37.590
No problem.

12:37.624 --> 12:39.659
-My commission's 20%, though.
-(laughs)

12:39.692 --> 12:42.395
-20%? Wow.
-20%. Go ahead,
give it to him, man.

12:42.429 --> 12:46.599
-Break the bank.
-20% of 20%. How about that?

12:46.633 --> 12:48.601
JEROME:
Oh, it sounds like a scam to me!

12:48.635 --> 12:52.339
Pay $200 to find out what type
of kid you're gonna have.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.407
Well, you're gonna find out
for free eventually,

12:54.441 --> 12:56.143
like God intended the shit.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.811
FRANKLIN:
It's gonna be a girl, no doubt.

12:57.845 --> 13:00.780
-Hey, nephew!
-JEROME: College boy.

13:00.814 --> 13:04.184
-What up, nephew?
-FRANKLIN: Auntie,
look at you, all big.

13:04.217 --> 13:06.653
I see they ain't teach you
how to talk to no lady

13:06.686 --> 13:08.488
-up in that
motherfucking school.
-No, they ain't teaching

13:08.521 --> 13:10.690
Pregnant Hood Bitches 101.
(laughs)

13:10.723 --> 13:13.160
FRANKLIN:
I just meant you farther along
than I thought.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.162
-That's all. Wow.
-Mm-hmm.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.430
(chuckles)
What you doing here?

13:17.464 --> 13:20.000
You get that loan shit straight?

13:20.033 --> 13:22.836
-Mama told y'all
about that, huh?
-Well, yeah.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.838
So, what's up?

13:27.340 --> 13:30.643
You know, we was gonna
help you out with that, but, uh,

13:30.677 --> 13:33.046
between the baby coming
and me having to front

13:33.080 --> 13:35.548
for product
with the Mexicans, man,

13:35.582 --> 13:36.950
a little cash-strapped
right now.

13:36.984 --> 13:38.518
It's fine, Unc. For real.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.687
Wasn't the right place for me
anyway, you know?

13:40.720 --> 13:43.023
LOUIE:
What you mean?

13:43.056 --> 13:45.492
Wh-What, you done with school?

13:46.526 --> 13:48.528
For now.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.398
(sighs)

13:51.431 --> 13:55.402
Hey. You want to help me
move this weed?

13:55.435 --> 13:59.506
You'll have that cash
in no time.

14:01.741 --> 14:03.676
LOUIE:
Uh-uh. No.

14:03.710 --> 14:06.313
-He ain't doing that.
-I put a gun to the boy head?

14:06.346 --> 14:08.748
I'm trying to help him out.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.886
No.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.155
No, no. For real.

14:15.188 --> 14:18.858
It's okay, Unc. It's fine.

14:18.892 --> 14:22.695
So, um, you know,
you got the baby.

14:22.729 --> 14:24.932
Y'all picked out any names yet?

14:24.965 --> 14:27.734
'Cause you know, me, personally,

14:27.767 --> 14:31.004
I think Frankesha
is a perfect name.

14:31.038 --> 14:33.206
-Frankesha.
-Right? Frankesha?

14:33.240 --> 14:35.208
(Louie laughs)

14:35.242 --> 14:37.244
(excited chatter, laughter)

14:37.277 --> 14:39.279
*

14:53.060 --> 14:55.262
(indistinct chatter)

14:55.295 --> 14:57.897
(upbeat music playing
over boom box)

15:05.838 --> 15:07.840
*

15:26.926 --> 15:28.128
(coos)

15:33.266 --> 15:35.235
-WANDA: He need to be changed.
-(baby crying)

15:35.268 --> 15:38.605
-I look like the nanny?
-(scoffs) Goddamn.

15:38.638 --> 15:41.308
MAN (over TV):
Yeah, you know, he has to do
some adjusting there...

15:41.341 --> 15:44.277
-Oh, shit.
-What's up, Lee?

15:44.311 --> 15:45.778
This water must got me
fucked up,

15:45.812 --> 15:47.014
seeing ghosts around here.

15:47.047 --> 15:49.016
Fuck you doing here?

15:49.049 --> 15:50.517
(TV broadcast continues
indistinctly)

15:50.550 --> 15:52.452
Whitey finally realize
you a nigga

15:52.485 --> 15:54.454
and kicked your ass to the curb?

15:54.487 --> 15:56.456
-Something like that.
-WANDA: Leon!

15:56.489 --> 15:59.592
WANDA:
Your son done shit everywhere.

15:59.626 --> 16:03.230
Nigga, get the fuck up and come
help me clean that shit up!

16:04.297 --> 16:05.532
Hey, Franklin.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.001
Hey, Wanda.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.871
Nigga, get the fuck up.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.176
Franklin, take his ass
back to school with you!

16:16.209 --> 16:19.879
-Make something of himself.
-LEON: At least if I shoot her,

16:19.912 --> 16:22.449
-they'll just put me
back inside, right?
-(chuckles)

16:22.482 --> 16:24.584
WANDA:
Leon, I'm not fucking
playing with you!

16:26.819 --> 16:28.455
Leon!

16:28.488 --> 16:30.457
Hey.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.060
Jerome still in that weed
and water game?

16:33.093 --> 16:35.095
Think he could put me on?

16:36.896 --> 16:38.698
I'll ask him.

16:38.731 --> 16:42.069
Franklin, there's six of us
in my mama's spot right now.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.504
I got to put something together.

16:47.274 --> 16:49.242
Hey, little nigga.

16:49.276 --> 16:51.311
With the fucking camera.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.413
-The fuck you doing?
-I'm filming.

16:53.446 --> 16:56.049
Yeah, I can see that.
What the fuck you doing it for?

16:56.083 --> 16:57.817
'Cause I'm making a movie.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.587
Nah, what you making is evidence
for the police.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.155
Let me see that shit.

17:02.189 --> 17:03.590
What? No!

17:03.623 --> 17:06.159
-Get off... get off me!
-Let go of the camera.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.995
-Give me that shit!
-Come on, man.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.997
-Let that man live.
-Ain't nobody in the hood

17:11.030 --> 17:13.400
making no motherfucking movie!

17:13.433 --> 17:15.635
With your square ass.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.540
Stupid-ass nigga.

17:23.743 --> 17:28.014
CISSY:
What happened at school
wasn't your fault, Franklin.

17:28.047 --> 17:31.050
And I'm not here
trying to punish you.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.857
It wouldn't hurt
to earn a few bucks

17:37.890 --> 17:41.128
while you're trying
to figure things out.

17:44.231 --> 17:46.933
I stopped by Cho's
on my way home.

17:46.966 --> 17:48.435
Said he's been sick.

17:48.468 --> 17:51.471
Could use some extra help.

17:56.943 --> 17:58.311
All right.

18:03.082 --> 18:07.954
* Tell me who you are... *

18:07.987 --> 18:09.456
JEROME:
Hey, Louie!

18:09.489 --> 18:11.458
* I want your love... *

18:11.491 --> 18:12.659
Sweetheart, why don't you
come over here

18:12.692 --> 18:14.093
and help us out with this shit?

18:14.127 --> 18:17.063
(laughs)
You seem to be doing just fine.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.466
(banging on door)

18:19.499 --> 18:20.633
JEROME:
Hold on, now.

18:22.001 --> 18:23.503
-Get the... get the dog.
-What should I do?

18:23.536 --> 18:25.238
Wait, wait, hold on. Hold on.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.140
FRANKLIN:
Wait, hold up.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.975
*

18:33.112 --> 18:34.614
(dog barking in distance)

18:34.647 --> 18:36.416
FRANKLIN:
Huh? I should get it?

18:36.449 --> 18:37.584
Yeah, get it, get it.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.686
Hey. Hold on, now, nephew.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.988
-(Jerome muttering)
-FRANKLIN: Wait. Hold up. Wait.

18:42.021 --> 18:44.824
(exhales) It's Leon.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.293
What's up, man?

18:46.326 --> 18:49.762
What the fuck
you so uptight for?

18:49.796 --> 18:51.598
Boy, you'll get
your goddamn ass shot.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.966
Who the fuck you gonna shoot
with that little-ass gun?

18:54.000 --> 18:55.134
(Jerome chuckling)

18:55.168 --> 18:56.936
You getting big, huh?

18:56.969 --> 18:59.506
Better way to get your ass shot.

18:59.539 --> 19:02.442
JEROME:
How much you want to start with?

19:02.475 --> 19:04.477
LEON:
I'll take a whole Z.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.279
JEROME:
That be 150.

19:06.313 --> 19:09.516
Now, I'm telling you right now,
don't make me into no asshole.

19:09.549 --> 19:12.285
You move it, you bring it back,
you set me right.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.554
I mean, I don't see
how that shit gonna stop you

19:14.587 --> 19:16.789
from being an asshole, but okay.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.891
JEROME:
Your boy got an attitude
problem, huh?

19:18.925 --> 19:20.727
LEON:
Shut the fuck up, nigga.
I'm right here.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.962
-Why the fuck you looking
at him? Huh?
-Come on, Lee.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.631
Come on, what?
This nigga already an asshole,

19:24.664 --> 19:26.466
been an asshole, gonna forever
be a fucking asshole.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.001
Huh?

19:29.035 --> 19:31.404
JEROME:
How about I slap the shit
out you with this pistol?

19:31.438 --> 19:34.173
-Go ahead. Slap me, nigga.
-Louie, shoot this motherfucker
in the head.

19:34.207 --> 19:36.175
-Get the fuck up, nigga.
-Little bitch-ass motherfucker.

19:36.209 --> 19:38.545
-Shut your ass up.
-You shut up.
I'll spray the fucking concrete

19:38.578 --> 19:40.747
-with your little bitch ass.
-Go ahead.
Who you shooting at, nigga?

19:40.780 --> 19:42.549
You ain't gonna shoot shit,
nigga.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.384
-You ain't never shot shit...
-Let me see your paperwork.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.553
Heard they was fucking your ass
up in goddamn county. Yeah!

19:54.193 --> 19:56.863
LEON:
I ain't even mind them
motherfuckers inside.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.598
Or the food.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.433
But the man got you
on his schedule

20:00.467 --> 20:02.335
every second of every day.

20:02.369 --> 20:05.137
And the guards treating you
like they own you.

20:06.239 --> 20:08.140
Shit wear on you.

20:10.109 --> 20:12.078
Everybody's owned by somebody.

20:12.111 --> 20:14.046
(kids chattering playfully)

20:14.080 --> 20:15.582
Not like this.

20:17.284 --> 20:20.186
Hey, why the fuck
you ain't at that school?

20:20.219 --> 20:23.923
Thought for sure
you wasn't ever coming back.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.958
(clicks tongue)
I got fucked.

20:27.594 --> 20:31.030
(sighs)
Maybe I fucked myself.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.032
I don't know.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.768
Thought I could play their game
my way and still win.

20:35.802 --> 20:37.203
(chuckles)

20:37.236 --> 20:39.205
Franklin Saint.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.641
Always thinking
there's a better way.

20:44.277 --> 20:46.679
So, what's the better way now?

21:07.266 --> 21:10.102
Franklin Saint?

21:11.538 --> 21:12.939
(car door closes)

21:12.972 --> 21:15.107
Hey, I'm Teddy McDonald.

21:15.141 --> 21:18.678
Y-You came to a presentation
I gave at Claremont.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.585
You're the recruiter?

21:25.618 --> 21:26.986
Yeah.
(chuckles)

21:27.019 --> 21:28.621
Sorry to just show up like this.
(clears throat)

21:28.655 --> 21:30.957
I was wondering if maybe
you had a few minutes to talk.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.402
Great.

21:44.871 --> 21:46.773
It's just you and your mom?

21:46.806 --> 21:49.376
Uh-huh.

21:50.643 --> 21:53.446
-Your dad?
-Uh...

21:53.480 --> 21:56.349
He'd been living
on the streets a long time.

21:56.383 --> 21:59.386
Cops gave him a beating a few
years back. He didn't make it.

22:04.691 --> 22:06.659
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-Look, I don't mean to be rude,

22:06.693 --> 22:09.061
-but, uh, what...
-What the hell am I doing here?

22:09.095 --> 22:10.697
(chuckles):
Yeah, yeah.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.665
(chuckles)

22:12.699 --> 22:14.300
I came to see if the CIA

22:14.333 --> 22:16.268
might be the right career path
for you.

22:17.937 --> 22:19.539
I'm sorry, what?
(chuckles)

22:19.572 --> 22:23.042
The... the CIA?

22:24.276 --> 22:26.746
You came here to hire me?

22:26.779 --> 22:30.883
Well, um, I mean, you'd have to
finish school first, of course.

22:30.917 --> 22:33.019
And then you would go
through our process.

22:33.052 --> 22:36.489
Exams, interviews, background
checks, there's a polygraph.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.290
You know, it's not easy, but...

22:39.358 --> 22:41.761
...from what I hear,
you can handle it.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.864
And what did you hear?

22:44.897 --> 22:48.435
3.9 GPA, double major

22:48.468 --> 22:51.170
political science, economics.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.739
1540 on your SATs.

22:52.772 --> 22:55.942
Your professors speak glowingly
about your work ethic

22:55.975 --> 22:58.277
and your critical thinking.

22:58.310 --> 23:01.581
And you've shown
an acute ability to move easily

23:01.614 --> 23:03.249
between worlds.

23:03.282 --> 23:06.686
I should add that diversity
has become

23:06.719 --> 23:08.755
increasingly important
to the Agency.

23:08.788 --> 23:11.858
You see, to meet
ever more complex goals

23:11.891 --> 23:14.494
going forward, we have
to broaden our perspectives.

23:15.562 --> 23:17.296
You seem surprised.

23:17.329 --> 23:21.200
(chuckles)
I just never thought about

23:21.233 --> 23:23.903
-working for the government.
-Really?

23:26.606 --> 23:30.276
D-Do you mind if I ask why?

23:30.309 --> 23:33.713
You know, the... the government
never cared about me.

23:33.746 --> 23:37.183
So, why help them?

23:39.285 --> 23:41.488
This kind of work's
not for everyone.

23:45.157 --> 23:47.760
Why do you do it?

23:47.794 --> 23:49.428
-Tradition.
-Mm.

23:49.462 --> 23:52.131
Duty.

23:52.164 --> 23:56.736
And I believe in America.
Its mission.

23:56.769 --> 24:00.840
You know, they recruited me
at Yale, 'cause, uh,

24:00.873 --> 24:02.975
I was the best
and the brightest.

24:03.009 --> 24:05.578
Like you.

24:05.612 --> 24:08.748
Well, you know,
e-even if I was interested,

24:08.781 --> 24:11.017
there's a problem...

24:11.050 --> 24:13.986
with school.

24:14.020 --> 24:16.489
A problem like you assaulting
the financial aid officer?

24:19.458 --> 24:21.360
Rumor has it
that Alexander Hamilton punched

24:21.393 --> 24:24.631
-a bursar at Princeton.
-(chuckling): For real?

24:24.664 --> 24:26.365
Man. Wow.

24:26.398 --> 24:28.735
You know, we're not looking
for spotless backgrounds.

24:29.802 --> 24:32.471
We're looking for people
with backbones.

24:32.505 --> 24:36.442
And if you're concerned
about getting back into school,

24:36.475 --> 24:39.311
consider that taken care of.

24:39.345 --> 24:43.883
Anyway, uh, I'm gonna be in L.A.
for a few more weeks,

24:43.916 --> 24:45.284
but then I'm gonna be
back in D.C.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.787
After that, uh,
if you're interested,

24:47.820 --> 24:49.689
give this number a call.
They'll put us in touch.

24:49.722 --> 24:51.691
Theodore McDonald.
(chuckles)

25:01.868 --> 25:03.570
-Have a good one.
-Yeah.

25:03.603 --> 25:05.672
-You be safe out there.
-Sure thing.

25:12.679 --> 25:14.681
(indistinct voices on radio)

25:16.849 --> 25:18.517
Thank you.

25:23.189 --> 25:26.492
Oh, my bad.
Go right ahead.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.027
(chuckles)

25:28.060 --> 25:30.229
Cute-ass couple.

25:32.264 --> 25:35.602
-What's going on, little homey?
-What's up, man?

25:35.635 --> 25:36.936
Ain't nothing.

25:36.969 --> 25:40.873
Let me, uh, get
this box of Apple Smacks

25:40.907 --> 25:45.044
and, uh... oh, shit,
them yellow flip-flops.

25:45.077 --> 25:47.246
-Yeah, let me get a pair.
-All right, man.

25:47.279 --> 25:49.548
-Hey, size 13.
-(exhales)

25:49.582 --> 25:51.250
We ain't got no 13s.

25:51.283 --> 25:54.587
Damn, that's all good.
Hey, check this out, though.

25:54.621 --> 25:56.555
I guess I'll take all the money
in the register.

25:56.589 --> 25:59.191
Let's go, nigga. This your
first time being robbed?

25:59.225 --> 26:01.728
-Move! Get that money.
-(cash register rings)

26:01.761 --> 26:04.463
Let's go, man,
hurry your ass up!

26:04.496 --> 26:06.532
Nervous nigga
knocking shit down.

26:06.565 --> 26:10.036
Man, hell nah, this ain't
all you got. Go back, man.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.537
Take all the money out.

26:11.570 --> 26:14.641
Hell wrong with you, man?
Shit.

26:14.674 --> 26:18.444
Do with these coins, nigga?
I ain't riding the bus.

26:18.477 --> 26:20.713
Matter of fact, run that money
in your pocket, too.

26:20.747 --> 26:23.650
Shit. Let's go, nigga!

26:23.683 --> 26:24.951
Shit.

26:24.984 --> 26:27.486
Two dollars?

26:27.519 --> 26:28.988
Shit. Broke-ass nigga, man.

26:29.021 --> 26:31.557
Man, just-just take it and go.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.092
The fuck you say to me?

26:33.125 --> 26:36.395
-What, you trying
to tell me what to do?
-No.

26:36.428 --> 26:39.231
-Oh, you think
you're my boss, huh?
-No.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.734
-No.
-Nigga, you ain't shit.

26:41.768 --> 26:44.170
I'll take your fucking life
right now if I want to.

26:44.203 --> 26:46.605
Matter of fact.

26:46.639 --> 26:48.941
Hey, say you're my bitch.

26:48.975 --> 26:50.677
What?

26:50.710 --> 26:51.944
Say it, nigga,
right fucking now!

26:51.978 --> 26:53.545
I'm-I'm your bitch.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.448
(Franklin panting)

26:57.717 --> 27:00.653
Now say you're my fucking bitch.

27:00.687 --> 27:02.454
I'm your bitch, man.

27:02.488 --> 27:04.256
I'm your bitch.

27:04.290 --> 27:06.192
Trying to lose
your goddamn life tonight?

27:06.225 --> 27:08.761
-Ass end up on the news, nigga.
-(door opens)

27:08.795 --> 27:09.996
Fuck wrong with you?

27:13.332 --> 27:14.867
ANDRE:
No, no, no, no, no!

27:17.636 --> 27:20.572
*

27:45.064 --> 27:48.034
(indistinct voices on radio)

27:48.067 --> 27:50.069
You all right, Franklin?

27:54.941 --> 27:56.909
(breathing shakily)

27:56.943 --> 27:58.911
ANDRE:
Officer needs help.

27:58.945 --> 28:00.346
Shots fired.

28:00.379 --> 28:02.681
Cho's market.

28:02.715 --> 28:05.217
Requesting ambulance and backup.

28:05.251 --> 28:06.919
Black male.

28:06.953 --> 28:08.420
Not responding.

28:08.454 --> 28:09.722
Not breathing.

28:09.756 --> 28:11.724
WOMAN (over radio):
10-4. Confirm Cho's market.

28:11.758 --> 28:13.760
Backup and rescue unit
on the way.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.869
-Came in through the door.
-Okay.

28:22.902 --> 28:25.671
Saw the suspect
with the gun in his hand.

28:25.704 --> 28:26.739
He fired a shot at me.

28:26.773 --> 28:29.708
I ducked, fired three shots...

28:43.722 --> 28:45.524
-Excuse us.
-CISSY: Franklin?

28:45.557 --> 28:47.293
-Ma'am.
-Sorry.

28:47.326 --> 28:48.694
-Ma-Ma'am.
-Franklin.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.729
Oh, my God.

28:53.732 --> 28:56.102
-Are you okay?
-Mm-hmm.

28:56.135 --> 28:59.105
God. Come on.

28:59.138 --> 29:01.140
Let's get you out of here.

29:03.342 --> 29:05.344
FRANKLIN:
Thank you.

29:19.325 --> 29:21.060
CISSY:
That's it.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.995
You're going back
to school somewhere.

29:23.029 --> 29:25.031
I will find the money.

29:26.833 --> 29:30.002
FRANKLIN:
I'm not going back
to that world.

29:31.037 --> 29:33.739
I don't belong there.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.775
You don't belong here,
either, Franklin.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.780
You're too big for this place.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.953
FRANKLIN:
I don't know what to do, Mama.

29:55.962 --> 29:58.730
CISSY:
You know, I've had
this conversation before.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.968
With your father.

30:03.970 --> 30:06.772
He felt the same way.

30:06.805 --> 30:10.943
Betrayed by the Panthers,
by his country.

30:10.977 --> 30:14.046
A man without a place
in this world.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.319
But he let them win.

30:22.188 --> 30:24.123
He gave up.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.959
Mm-mm.

30:26.993 --> 30:29.195
You don't have to know how,

30:29.228 --> 30:31.163
but you have to keep going.

30:31.197 --> 30:32.798
You can do anything you want.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.800
Reapply for a scholarship

30:34.833 --> 30:36.802
to an all-black college
and finish school.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.670
Or go back to that...

30:38.704 --> 30:39.705
You have to keep going...

30:39.738 --> 30:41.540
And refuse to leave

30:41.573 --> 30:42.641
until they give you a job.

30:42.674 --> 30:43.876
You can do anything you want...

30:43.910 --> 30:46.879
Use them to learn the system,
pass the exams...

30:46.913 --> 30:48.414
You have to keep going...

30:48.447 --> 30:49.715
...and then come back
to South Central

30:49.748 --> 30:50.716
and open your own firm.

30:50.749 --> 30:52.351
You can do anything you want.

30:52.384 --> 30:54.987
Your ancestors suffered horrors

30:55.021 --> 30:57.756
beyond imagining
to give you this opportunity.

30:57.789 --> 30:59.091
You have to keep going...

30:59.125 --> 31:00.692
I've done all I can.
You can do anything you want.

31:00.726 --> 31:03.095
There is grace
for those who seek it.

31:03.129 --> 31:05.597
I believe it in my heart.

31:05.631 --> 31:08.534
You will be all right,
Franklin.

31:08.567 --> 31:12.871
But you have to stay and fight.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.552
(panting)

31:39.098 --> 31:42.501
* Southern trees *

31:43.502 --> 31:46.405
I got you.

31:46.438 --> 31:50.742
* Bearing strange fruit *

31:53.745 --> 31:56.748
* Blood on the leaves *

31:58.750 --> 32:00.886
-(gunshots)
-(woman screams)

32:00.919 --> 32:03.922
* And blood at the roots *

32:07.926 --> 32:09.795
* Black bodies *

32:09.828 --> 32:13.665
* Swinging
in the southern breeze *

32:13.699 --> 32:15.701
(gunshots)

32:21.207 --> 32:25.644
* Strange fruit hangin' *

32:27.213 --> 32:30.549
* From the poplar trees *

32:34.553 --> 32:37.156
* Pastoral scene *

32:37.189 --> 32:38.524
(crying)

32:38.557 --> 32:42.861
* Of the gallant south *

32:46.898 --> 32:51.603
* Them big bulging eyes *

32:51.637 --> 32:55.641
* And the twisted mouth *

33:00.379 --> 33:04.350
* Scent of magnolia *

33:04.383 --> 33:08.420
* Clean and fresh *

33:13.825 --> 33:16.028
* Then the sudden smell *

33:18.064 --> 33:22.601
* Of burning flesh *

33:27.539 --> 33:30.409
* Here is a fruit *

33:34.413 --> 33:38.417
* For the crows to pluck *

33:44.123 --> 33:47.193
* For the rain to gather *

33:47.226 --> 33:52.030
* For the wind to suck *

33:54.066 --> 33:56.702
* For the sun *

33:56.735 --> 33:59.205
* To rot *

34:01.940 --> 34:08.480
* For the leaves... *

34:13.752 --> 34:15.754
* To drop *

34:18.257 --> 34:21.893
* Here is *

34:21.927 --> 34:27.299
* A strange *

34:28.967 --> 34:33.405
* And *

34:33.439 --> 34:39.945
* Bitter *

34:41.347 --> 34:46.852
* Crop. *

35:04.102 --> 35:05.771
TOM BROKAW: There are
more than 400 youth gangs

35:05.804 --> 35:07.939
in Los Angeles, and these days
it doesn't take much

35:07.973 --> 35:09.275
to start a gang war.

35:09.308 --> 35:11.743
Just over the weekend,
seven people were killed

35:11.777 --> 35:13.445
in three separate attacks.

35:13.479 --> 35:15.247
Police say that extra security
during the Olympics

35:15.281 --> 35:16.815
kept the lid on at that time.

35:16.848 --> 35:18.250
Now they believe gang members

35:18.284 --> 35:19.618
may be settling
a lot of old s...

35:19.651 --> 35:21.653
You don't need
to be watching this.

35:24.055 --> 35:26.057
(exhales)

35:27.125 --> 35:29.428
Um...

35:29.461 --> 35:34.800
Your, uh, dad and I
are gonna step out for a bit.

35:34.833 --> 35:37.669
Okay?

35:38.904 --> 35:42.541
-Need anything?
-Nah, I'm good.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.011
All right.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.932
Thank you for coming.

36:11.603 --> 36:13.405
We in trouble.

36:13.439 --> 36:17.142
Okay? Drifting. Profits is down.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.144
Violence is rising.
The gangs at war.

36:19.177 --> 36:23.048
This entire business is about
to spin out of control...

36:23.081 --> 36:26.051
No.

36:26.084 --> 36:28.587
-JEROME: Cissy...
-He is not ready.

36:28.620 --> 36:30.689
LOUIE:
You need to let him
make that choice.

36:30.722 --> 36:32.658
(scoffs)
I most certainly do not.

36:32.691 --> 36:35.193
He started this shit.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.498
And it almost killed him.

36:39.531 --> 36:41.600
Three minutes
he was on that table.

36:41.633 --> 36:43.835
-His heart stopped.
-I was there. We all was there.

36:43.869 --> 36:46.872
Then how dare you ask me
to push him back in?

36:55.213 --> 36:59.084
If he ever does come back,
it'll be when we...

36:59.117 --> 37:01.753
-Oh, get the fuck out of here.
-...decide that he's able.

37:01.787 --> 37:03.789
-Decide what?
-And if y'all can't manage
this shit without him...

37:03.822 --> 37:05.357
Then what?

37:05.391 --> 37:07.759
Then you should have
the good sense to walk away

37:07.793 --> 37:10.862
before somebody else dies
up in this piece.

37:10.896 --> 37:13.799
-Woman, you know you're in the
goddamn drug game now, right?
-LOUIE: You know that?

37:13.832 --> 37:16.402
-Do you know that?
-Why don't you go have
a fucking kid before you got...

37:16.435 --> 37:18.804
Oh, shut the fuck up with the
goddamn kid shit! You don't make

37:18.837 --> 37:21.139
-no fucking decisions...
-You don't motherfucking get
to make this decision!

37:21.172 --> 37:23.909
-You know you're a fucking
drug dealer now, right?
-He's my motherfucking son!

37:23.942 --> 37:26.712
-This is my shit!
-I don't give a fuck
what you say!

37:26.745 --> 37:28.447
-CISSY: That's my goddamn son!
-ALTON: This is my wife, Jerome.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.949
-You understand me?
-Franklin!

37:32.784 --> 37:35.854
Fucking hardheaded.

37:42.260 --> 37:45.063
It's okay, Mama.

37:45.096 --> 37:47.265
Huh?

37:49.134 --> 37:52.037
All right. I'm here.

37:54.306 --> 37:56.975
Talk to me.

37:57.008 --> 37:59.811
CISSY:
I still don't understand why.

37:59.845 --> 38:03.615
We have the money, we can leave.

38:03.649 --> 38:05.250
All of us.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.285
Start a life somewhere else.

38:09.321 --> 38:11.990
I didn't build all of this
just to make a bunch of money

38:12.023 --> 38:14.826
and leave, abandon our people.

38:14.860 --> 38:17.262
You telling me this is still
about our people?

38:17.295 --> 38:19.431
Have you taken a look about
what's going on out there?

38:19.465 --> 38:22.434
I have. And that's exactly why
I can't leave now.

38:22.468 --> 38:23.935
ALTON:
You can't control what happens,

38:23.969 --> 38:25.471
Franklin.

38:25.504 --> 38:28.173
-You can't stop what's coming.
-Maybe, maybe not.

38:28.206 --> 38:33.845
But what I know for sure is,
if we bail,

38:33.879 --> 38:36.815
there'll be chaos.

38:36.848 --> 38:40.151
We'll leave a vacuum, for sure.

38:40.185 --> 38:44.856
Gangs battling over control
and territory.

38:44.890 --> 38:47.459
And an entire fucking community
in ruins.

38:47.493 --> 38:49.227
Is that what you want?

38:49.260 --> 38:51.329
You still haven't fully healed.

38:51.363 --> 38:53.365
(exhales)

39:02.608 --> 39:05.076
(ragged exhale)

39:06.344 --> 39:07.913
I've healed enough.

39:08.947 --> 39:12.684
And I have to stay and fight.

39:12.718 --> 39:14.720
I'm sorry.

39:21.927 --> 39:24.530
I got to...

39:24.563 --> 39:28.033
got to go take care
of something.

39:30.068 --> 39:32.070
I love you.

39:51.289 --> 39:53.291
(engine shuts off)

39:57.463 --> 39:59.431
Ah.

39:59.465 --> 40:02.133
You are a sight for sore eyes.
(chuckles)

40:02.167 --> 40:04.369
Ain't I glad to see you.

40:04.402 --> 40:07.739
(train horn blows)

40:07.773 --> 40:10.375
-You look good.
-Ah.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.744
Look like I'm hurting,
which I am.

40:16.181 --> 40:17.983
But I've subscribed
to the notion

40:18.016 --> 40:20.986
that whatever doesn't kill us
simply makes us...

40:22.287 --> 40:24.890
-Stronger.
-Sharper.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.492
Sharper.

40:28.293 --> 40:31.362
Did you know that L.A. used
to suffer from serious floods?

40:33.532 --> 40:36.267
TEDDY:
Yeah, I think I heard that
at some point.

40:36.301 --> 40:37.903
FRANKLIN:
You know,
they tried building dams,

40:37.936 --> 40:39.938
but that didn't solve it.

40:39.971 --> 40:43.408
So after a couple disastrous
floods in the '30s,

40:43.441 --> 40:46.478
L.A. reached out
to the federal government.

40:47.713 --> 40:49.848
And they brought in
the Army Corps of Engineers,

40:49.881 --> 40:53.685
and in 20 years they built
and designed the L.A. River,

40:53.719 --> 40:58.156
a 50-mile waterway that saved
the City of Angels.

41:04.229 --> 41:07.633
I was right about this rock.

41:07.666 --> 41:11.637
We're making more money than
we ever could've dreamed of.

41:11.670 --> 41:15.641
What I was wrong about
was the cost.

41:16.675 --> 41:19.645
Lives are gonna be destroyed.

41:19.678 --> 41:23.782
Ain't a thing I can do about
that now except to keep going,

41:23.815 --> 41:27.218
keep things under control
as best I can, you know?

41:31.022 --> 41:33.424
Yeah, how do you do that?

41:36.194 --> 41:38.396
I bring in
the federal government.

41:40.265 --> 41:44.069
I'll identify anybody
who poses a threat to stability,

41:44.102 --> 41:46.972
and you'll help me
take 'em down.

41:47.005 --> 41:50.208
That's how we keep
the violence at bay,

41:50.241 --> 41:53.211
stay out the papers
so we can make that paper. Huh?

41:53.244 --> 41:54.846
(chuckles)

41:54.880 --> 41:57.583
Why would I help you do that?

41:57.616 --> 41:59.250
Well, because...

42:01.753 --> 42:05.456
...the CIA wants me to keep
flowing money here, Reed.

42:08.694 --> 42:14.032
Or James Smith or Thomas Parker
or whatever your name is.

42:16.467 --> 42:19.170
You can destroy me any time
you want, I get it.

42:19.204 --> 42:24.442
But you see, the thing is,
I'm not afraid of dying anymore.

42:25.644 --> 42:28.413
Not even so much afraid
of prison.

42:28.446 --> 42:31.416
But what I will not be

42:31.449 --> 42:35.186
is a slave... to anyone.

42:35.220 --> 42:37.222
Even you.

42:41.092 --> 42:43.629
Remember McDonald's?

42:43.662 --> 42:45.463
Thousand keys a week?

42:45.496 --> 42:47.532
Oh, yeah.

42:47.565 --> 42:49.134
I'll make you
so much fucking money,

42:49.167 --> 42:51.536
you'll be able to fund that war
all by yourself.

42:51.569 --> 42:55.040
They're gonna name a wing at the
CIA headquarters after your ass.

42:55.073 --> 42:57.643
Real American hero shit.

42:57.676 --> 43:01.246
And in return, you'll make sure
that me and mine are protected.

43:01.279 --> 43:03.414
And at the end of this,
the both of us

43:03.448 --> 43:06.317
are gonna ride off
into the sunset.

43:06.351 --> 43:08.353
("Law of the Land"
by The Temptations playing)

43:11.422 --> 43:14.259
You said you'd be here with me
until the end.

43:21.867 --> 43:24.302
Did you really mean it?

43:30.976 --> 43:35.246
* Some people
will always have it made *

43:35.280 --> 43:37.248
* Some people will live
in poverty *

43:37.282 --> 43:39.250
* For the rest of their days *

43:39.284 --> 43:43.989
* Time marches on *

43:44.022 --> 43:47.158
* Yesterday is dead and gone *

43:47.192 --> 43:50.328
* Life is uncertain *

43:50.361 --> 43:51.863
-* Let me hear you say *
-* Yeah *

43:51.897 --> 43:55.033
* Death is final, yes, it is *

43:56.634 --> 43:59.671
* There'll be days
of sunshine and laughter *

43:59.705 --> 44:04.309
* But don't forget you're gonna
have to shed some tears *

44:04.342 --> 44:05.844
* Whoa-ho *

44:05.877 --> 44:08.947
* It's the law of the land,
my brother *

44:08.980 --> 44:12.017
* Oh, whether you like it
or you understand *

44:12.050 --> 44:13.618
* Ah, hey-hey *

44:13.651 --> 44:15.120
* It's the law of the land *

44:15.153 --> 44:18.223
* Hey, hey, hey, hey *

44:18.256 --> 44:21.727
* Laws made by almighty man *

44:21.760 --> 44:23.328
* Live by the good book. *
