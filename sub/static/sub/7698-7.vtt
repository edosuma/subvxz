WEBVTT

01:31.841 --> 01:34.427
We've waited weeks for reservations.

01:42.935 --> 01:45.980
- Name?
- King, party of one.

01:46.397 --> 01:50.693
King, King. No, I'm sorry,
I don't show that reservation.

01:50.985 --> 01:54.488
Oh, yeah? Well, let me
show you something, fruitcake.

01:56.324 --> 01:57.533
Ahh!

02:00.786 --> 02:02.288
Hands up, chowhounds.

02:02.622 --> 02:08.711
Drop your forks and prepare to cower
before the uncanny Condiment King.

02:08.794 --> 02:11.464
- Who is that?
- Some kind of nutcase.

02:11.547 --> 02:14.592
- Just ignore him.
- Someone will call security.

02:15.051 --> 02:20.681
Hey. Hey! I don't believe this!
I say cower, and you're still eating?

02:21.098 --> 02:22.892
Well, all right then.

02:30.066 --> 02:32.318
Now, see here, you.

02:39.283 --> 02:40.534
Hot sauce.

02:41.911 --> 02:43.954
Anyone else want to be a hero?

02:44.163 --> 02:46.332
Then take out your wallets,
cash and jewels

02:46.499 --> 02:49.085
and toss them here on the table.
Come on. Right now.

02:52.546 --> 02:54.882
<i>Disturbance reported at
the top of the Crown restaurant.</i>

02:55.132 --> 02:59.011
<i>Suspect is a male, costumed extremist
armed with what appears to be</i>

02:59.220 --> 03:00.262
<i>a ketchup gun.</i>

03:00.513 --> 03:03.015
It's gonna be one of those nights.

03:08.604 --> 03:13.693
So long, suckers.
Parting is such sweet-and-sour sorrow.

03:22.243 --> 03:23.411
What's this?

03:23.869 --> 03:26.997
Ah! The big, bad Bat-guy.

03:27.498 --> 03:31.377
I knew you'd catch up to me sooner or
later. How I've relished this meeting.

03:31.961 --> 03:37.675
You, the dynamic Dark Knight, versus me,
the conceptual Condiment King.

03:38.050 --> 03:39.093
Come, Batman.

03:39.552 --> 03:42.888
Let's see if you can cut the mustard-

03:42.972 --> 03:44.098
Quiet.

03:46.267 --> 03:49.353
- You hit me.
- Now, listen, Mustard Man,

03:49.603 --> 03:51.272
or whatever you call yourself.

03:51.814 --> 03:55.192
You're obviously new at this,
so I'm willing to go easy on you.

03:55.401 --> 03:58.863
Provided you give back the loot and
never even think about doing this again.

03:59.113 --> 04:00.156
Deal?

04:01.282 --> 04:04.160
- Horseradish!
- This is your last warning.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.746
Let's go, Batso. You and me.

04:07.163 --> 04:10.124
I'm the prince of pickles,
sultan of sauce.

04:10.958 --> 04:13.335
You don't stand a chance. You hear me?

04:14.128 --> 04:15.755
Later, chump.

04:20.259 --> 04:21.469
Hang on.

04:33.397 --> 04:34.857
Harvey, call an ambulance.

04:35.983 --> 04:37.568
I know this man.

04:38.110 --> 04:40.696
He's that TV comic, Buddy Standler.

04:42.406 --> 04:44.074
<i>Still no clues in the mystery</i>

04:44.158 --> 04:45.826
<i>behind comedian Buddy Standler's</i>

04:45.910 --> 04:47.828
<i>one-man crime spree last night.</i>

04:48.078 --> 04:52.041
<i>A rampage that ended with a trip
to the hospital for the famed TV comic.</i>

04:52.291 --> 04:55.419
<i>Though Standler himself is unable
to account for his actions,</i>

04:55.586 --> 04:57.922
<i>his manager had these observations.</i>

04:58.172 --> 05:02.510
<i>I don't get it. Buddy's just thrown
his entire career away.</i>

05:02.718 --> 05:04.887
<i>The network's canceling his show</i>

05:05.054 --> 05:07.681
<i>and the restaurant's suing him
for a million dollars.</i>

05:07.890 --> 05:10.601
<i>Why'd he do it?
It just doesn't make sense.</i>

05:10.810 --> 05:14.522
That's too bad. I watch Standler's show
all the time. He's great.

05:14.730 --> 05:17.483
Any idea what would have caused him
to go off the deep end?

05:17.858 --> 05:20.361
No, but talk about bad timing.

05:20.778 --> 05:22.404
He was supposed to be one of the judges

05:22.488 --> 05:24.573
for the annual
laugh-off competition tonight.

05:24.949 --> 05:26.700
Alfred and I bought tickets.

05:27.284 --> 05:29.286
<i>By the way, where is Alfred?</i>

05:38.879 --> 05:42.216
- One side, mac.
- I beg your pardon.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.140
Ooh. Pretty. I want it.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.979
- Hey, you can't do that.
- Sure I can, lady.

05:55.187 --> 05:57.189
I'm the Pack Rat,

05:57.439 --> 06:00.693
-and your trash is my treasure.
- Hey!

06:03.863 --> 06:04.947
Mmm. Shiny.

06:06.323 --> 06:07.366
Security!

06:12.288 --> 06:13.914
Oh, no, you don't.

06:26.802 --> 06:29.013
Whoa, dibs on the dummy hand.

06:30.764 --> 06:32.016
Good heavens.

06:39.773 --> 06:42.109
I've been looking everyplace
for one of these.

06:53.162 --> 06:54.663
- Yes?
<i>- Master Bruce?</i>

06:54.747 --> 06:55.873
Alfred?

06:55.956 --> 06:58.250
I think you're needed at Mayfield's
right away, sir.

06:58.334 --> 07:00.252
There's a man with a gun running amok.

07:00.419 --> 07:01.503
He's-

07:01.670 --> 07:05.758
A word of advice, mac.
Never rat on a rat.

07:15.059 --> 07:16.185
<i>Alfred?</i>

07:19.772 --> 07:21.357
Alfred!

07:35.037 --> 07:37.539
<i>You'll get oatmeal and like it.</i>

07:38.040 --> 07:42.544
Listen, Eddie, if they expect me
to judge that stupid laugh-off again,

07:42.628 --> 07:44.755
they'd better be prepared to pay.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.968
Hold on, I got somebody at the door.

07:54.723 --> 07:56.642
- Yeah?
- Pizza delivery.

07:56.850 --> 07:58.727
I didn't order any pizza.

08:00.604 --> 08:04.608
- But I'll take it. How much?
- It's on me.

08:05.109 --> 08:06.902
Hey!

08:16.245 --> 08:18.247
Okay, everybody, empty your pockets.

08:19.707 --> 08:22.918
I want gum wrappers, loose string,
those little balls of lint.

08:24.962 --> 08:26.630
None of that cash stuff.

08:27.214 --> 08:28.465
Hey!

08:29.550 --> 08:31.051
What?

08:32.136 --> 08:35.723
So it's the rat versus the bat
and the brat.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.977
Only one will survive,
and that's gonna be me.

08:40.060 --> 08:41.395
Everybody, clear out.

09:10.090 --> 09:11.592
Come on out.

09:16.430 --> 09:17.848
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

09:52.007 --> 09:53.258
It's Harry Loomis.

09:53.550 --> 09:55.052
Another famous comedian.

09:55.302 --> 09:56.428
Look at his neck.

10:04.686 --> 10:05.979
A microchip?

10:07.106 --> 10:08.482
Mind control.

10:09.191 --> 10:12.945
This is beginning to point toward
our old friend, the Mad Hatter.

10:26.166 --> 10:29.044
Wake up, Jervis. We have to talk.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.714
Come on, rise and shine.

10:40.013 --> 10:41.765
Wow, he's really out.

11:07.082 --> 11:08.208
Here's what we know.

11:09.459 --> 11:13.380
Someone implants the Mad Hatter with
one of his own mind-control devices,

11:13.630 --> 11:15.799
then does the same thing
to two comedians.

11:15.966 --> 11:17.217
But what's the connection?

11:17.467 --> 11:19.720
Looks like it's three comedians
now, sir.

11:21.930 --> 11:24.391
"TV personality Lisa Lorraine
was abducted

11:24.474 --> 11:26.310
"from her apartment early this evening."

11:26.518 --> 11:30.397
And here's our common link.
This comedy competition.

11:30.647 --> 11:33.400
Sure. Buddy, Harry and Lisa
judge it every year.

11:33.859 --> 11:35.444
Remember, we taped the last one.

11:35.903 --> 11:37.112
Right here, Master Dick.

11:37.196 --> 11:39.114
And I've cued it
to something you should see.

11:45.412 --> 11:47.206
<i>Well, that's it for our contestants.</i>

11:47.289 --> 11:50.542
<i>Now our panel of distinguished judges
will choose</i>

11:50.626 --> 11:53.670
<i>the funniest person in Gotham.</i>

12:01.303 --> 12:05.390
<i>Not so fast, chuckles.
You haven't introduced me yet.</i>

12:05.599 --> 12:07.643
<i>Smiling Shecky Rimshot.</i>

12:07.726 --> 12:09.228
<i>Ba-dum-boom.</i>

12:11.563 --> 12:12.856
<i>Come on, already.</i>

12:14.775 --> 12:16.526
<i>Good evening, ladies and germs.</i>

12:16.777 --> 12:19.738
<i>Hey, did you hear about the guy
walked into a doctor's office</i>

12:19.821 --> 12:21.990
<i>with a frog on his head? Doctor says,</i>

12:22.074 --> 12:24.868
<i>"That's the weirdest looking wart
I've ever seen." Frog looks up and says,</i>

12:24.952 --> 12:27.955
<i>"Yeah, I woke up this morning,
there was a big bump on my butt."</i>

12:34.002 --> 12:36.463
<i>Hey, then there's this guy who buys
a new dog.</i>

12:36.546 --> 12:38.340
<i>He takes it for a walk
and the friend says-</i>

12:38.423 --> 12:39.633
Huh?

12:39.800 --> 12:43.095
<i>Sorry, pal.
We've already made our decision.</i>

12:43.303 --> 12:47.266
<i>And for your information,
registration closed days ago.</i>

12:47.683 --> 12:50.519
<i>I'm not leaving until I get that trophy.</i>

12:52.229 --> 12:54.314
<i>Oh, yes, you are.</i>

12:58.819 --> 13:00.696
You <i>can't</i> do <i>this</i> to me!

13:00.779 --> 13:02.781
<i>I'm the greatest comic in Gotham!</i>

13:04.032 --> 13:06.910
<i>I'll get even. I'II ruin you all.</i>

13:07.494 --> 13:09.079
<i>Freeze</i> it <i>right there.</i>

13:12.708 --> 13:14.626
I think I see what you mean, Alfred.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.421
Without the hat...

13:19.631 --> 13:21.049
And different hair...

13:21.508 --> 13:22.843
The Joker!

13:37.149 --> 13:38.900
I tell you, Maury, I'm dying here.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.277
I got a full house,

13:40.360 --> 13:43.572
and all three of my celebrity judges
are either missing or in jail.

13:43.655 --> 13:46.033
You gotta find me
some replacements quick.

13:46.950 --> 13:49.453
Ask and ye shall receive.

13:49.870 --> 13:51.580
What in the...

13:52.497 --> 13:57.127
Permit me to introduce Judges
Knuckles, Vinnie and Kowalski.

13:57.544 --> 14:00.297
They'll be presenting me
with the trophy tonight.

14:00.797 --> 14:03.842
Listen, you
can't just walk in here and take...

14:04.009 --> 14:06.011
Oh, but I already have.

14:12.184 --> 14:14.394
These little microchips are a wonder.

14:14.728 --> 14:18.982
Remind me to thank the Mad Hatter
if he ever wakes up.

14:20.859 --> 14:22.736
Hey, start the show already.

14:23.111 --> 14:26.156
- Let's go already!
- Start the show!

14:26.615 --> 14:31.286
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the 10th annual Gotham Laff Off.

14:32.746 --> 14:35.415
And now, it is my deepest honor
to present to you

14:35.499 --> 14:40.170
the evening's first and only contestant,
Smiling Shecky Rimshot.

14:41.755 --> 14:43.507
Hey, folks, you're beautiful.

14:43.590 --> 14:46.510
Funny thing happened to me
on the way to the theater last year.

14:46.593 --> 14:50.972
It seems three no-talent hacks
tried to stop me from winning.

14:51.181 --> 14:52.516
But guess what!

14:55.185 --> 14:57.521
I'm back.

15:04.486 --> 15:07.614
Oh! Such unhappy faces.

15:08.073 --> 15:10.200
Judges, let's cheer them up.

15:14.538 --> 15:18.667
My high-octane laughing gas
will have you rolling in the aisles.

15:33.682 --> 15:35.976
It's just you and us, Joker.

15:36.309 --> 15:38.353
Not quite, Batman.

15:38.603 --> 15:42.774
I've got a new girl, and she'll
really sweep you off your feet.

15:47.112 --> 15:48.405
Lisa Lorraine?

15:51.408 --> 15:54.870
Call me Mighty Mom.

15:55.078 --> 15:56.371
Ain't she sweet?

15:57.622 --> 16:01.001
My very own happy homemaker.

16:01.168 --> 16:03.378
But I don't do windows.

16:04.754 --> 16:06.006
Not bad.

16:06.298 --> 16:09.301
Honey, why don't you show our pals
how you clean house?

16:09.551 --> 16:12.345
In other words, mop 'em up.

16:20.520 --> 16:23.440
Who's first to get dusted?

16:23.982 --> 16:25.609
Think you can get
the brain patch off her?

16:25.817 --> 16:26.818
No problem.

16:33.450 --> 16:37.120
- Hey!
- Naughty boy. <i>Mama</i> spank.

16:43.585 --> 16:46.755
What did I tell you about playing
with your toys in the house?

16:47.380 --> 16:49.674
- Get rid of it!
- You're the boss.

16:58.517 --> 17:02.729
No! Not on my nice clean floor.

17:02.812 --> 17:05.565
- Just hold still.
- Ow!

17:05.815 --> 17:07.150
That hurts.

17:09.986 --> 17:13.490
- Don't worry. I'm back to normal.
- Who can tell?

17:37.889 --> 17:41.142
- Stay back.
- You've hit a new low, Joker.

17:41.560 --> 17:45.105
Only you would ruin three lives
for a silly piece of tin.

17:45.605 --> 17:47.691
You're dumber than you look, Bats.

17:49.943 --> 17:53.822
It's not the trophy that matters,
it's the title.

17:53.905 --> 17:58.660
I am the greatest clown
this dismal burg has ever seen.

17:58.868 --> 18:02.414
What would the common folk do
without my pranks and antics?

18:02.956 --> 18:04.207
Let's find out.

18:08.837 --> 18:12.048
Up, up and away!

18:29.691 --> 18:31.318
Quit rocking the boat!

18:42.787 --> 18:45.707
Oh! Too bad, Bat-sap.

18:45.790 --> 18:48.001
But you should have remembered
the old saying,

18:48.251 --> 18:51.588
"Dying is easy, comedy is hard."

19:03.099 --> 19:04.934
Mind if I join the party?

19:12.275 --> 19:14.653
Ow! You miserable brat.

19:20.909 --> 19:22.869
Get this stupid thing off me.

19:29.209 --> 19:30.377
Oops!

19:31.920 --> 19:32.962
Watch it.

19:33.755 --> 19:36.424
I think I'm getting airsick.

19:56.069 --> 20:01.491
I'll get you for this, Batman!
No one upstages me and lives.

20:03.910 --> 20:06.830
Is there a problem, officers?

20:13.169 --> 20:18.174
What's so funny?
I'll give you something to laugh about!
