<i>Probably no one.</i>

01:00.277 --> 01:01.644
<i>Are they comedies or dramas?</i>

01:01.645 --> 01:02.904
<i>We're not even sure.</i>

01:02.905 --> 01:04.304

<i>Gay Paree!</i>

01:12.438 --> 01:14.481
<i>ANNOUNCER:</i>
<i>TV: what a mess.</i>

01:14.482 --> 01:15.482
Hi, everybody.

01:15.483 --> 01:16.900
You know how I've been dieting

01:16.901 --> 01:19.027
like a maniac
the last couple weeks?

01:19.028 --> 01:21.321
Aw, damn it, that means
we're having people over.

01:21.322 --> 01:23.549
We're having people over!

01:23.550 --> 01:25.626
I just got off the phone
with my mom,

01:25.627 --> 01:28.254
and all the Pewterschmidts are
coming here for Thanksgiving.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.664
I can't believe
you invited the whole family.

01:30.665 --> 01:32.291
You know I hate
big Thanksgivings.

01:32.292 --> 01:34.084
Don't worry, Peter,
it's gonna be fun.

01:34.085 --> 01:35.970
And I can handle
most of the prep myself.

01:35.971 --> 01:37.796
I just need you
to go to the market

01:37.797 --> 01:39.457
and get some extra napkins.

01:39.458 --> 01:42.342
- That's not so bad.
- Oh. Pick up some wine
for the adults.

01:42.343 --> 01:45.721
- I can do that.
- A-And put the extra leaf
in the dining room table.

01:45.722 --> 01:47.731
(bleep)

01:47.732 --> 01:49.808
Oh, stop it.
It's so simple.

01:49.809 --> 01:52.236
Yeah, right. That table
ain't been opened in five years.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.771
It'll be fine. Just don't drink
while you do it.

01:54.772 --> 01:58.084
And for God's sake, don't lose
your temper with Chris.

01:58.085 --> 02:00.628
All right, one, two, three.

02:00.629 --> 02:01.903
Hup!

02:01.904 --> 02:03.196
(metal screeches)

02:03.197 --> 02:04.573
One more time.

02:04.574 --> 02:05.532
Hup!

02:05.533 --> 02:06.533
(metal screeches)

02:06.534 --> 02:07.909
Okay, all right, bend the knees.

02:07.910 --> 02:09.303
Let's give it a good pull.

02:09.304 --> 02:10.746
- Hup!
- (metal screeches)

02:10.747 --> 02:12.623
Yeah, I think one side is stuck.

02:12.624 --> 02:14.642
Do you, son?
Okay, on three.

02:14.643 --> 02:16.460
One, two, three.

02:16.461 --> 02:17.603
- Hup!
- (metal screeches)

02:17.604 --> 02:20.255
Hup! Hup!

02:20.256 --> 02:22.424
Hup! Hup! Hup!

02:22.425 --> 02:24.551
(both panting)

02:24.552 --> 02:26.386
I think it's still stuck.

02:26.387 --> 02:28.013
Oh, is that right?

02:28.014 --> 02:29.189
Lot of narration.

02:29.190 --> 02:31.116
It's like opening a table
with Ken Burns.

02:32.419 --> 02:34.445
Um, why don't you go easy
on that stuff?

02:34.446 --> 02:36.739
This "stuff" is
the only thing stopping you

02:36.740 --> 02:38.982
from getting
so karate-chopped right now.

02:38.983 --> 02:40.543
Okay, big pull, on three.

02:40.544 --> 02:42.319
All right, one, two, three.

02:42.320 --> 02:43.470
Hup!

02:43.471 --> 02:45.447
It's this one side,
it's just stuck.

02:45.448 --> 02:46.332
I know it's stuck!

02:46.333 --> 02:48.116
Everyone sees it's stuck!

02:48.117 --> 02:50.494
Are there voices you're hearing
shouting, "It's not stuck"?

02:50.495 --> 02:52.212
'Cause if you hear any argument

02:52.213 --> 02:54.289
from anybody who says
it isn't stuck,

02:54.290 --> 02:57.643
you send them to me, and I will
so karate-chop them in the face!

02:57.644 --> 02:59.637
Got it?!

02:59.638 --> 03:01.388
I'm not sure that that's...

03:01.389 --> 03:04.341
What?!
What aren't you sure about?

03:04.342 --> 03:05.276
Hup!

03:05.277 --> 03:08.011
Hup! Hup! Hup!

03:08.012 --> 03:10.156
Hey, Chris. Table looks stuck.

03:10.157 --> 03:13.074
Oh, really?
"Sky blue," says star witness.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.441
You know what's crazy
about this time of year?

03:21.442 --> 03:23.443
Everything is pumpkin spice.

03:23.444 --> 03:25.904
We all follow
your Twitter feed, Joe.

03:25.905 --> 03:28.007
God, Thanksgiving
is such a pain in the ass.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.550
I hate hosting.

03:29.551 --> 03:31.535
I hear you, Peter.
I hate Thanksgiving, too.

03:31.536 --> 03:34.621
Bonnie's sister is married
to a real show-off.

03:34.622 --> 03:37.708
Denise, Wendell,
it's great to see you.

03:37.709 --> 03:39.468
(motor whirring)

03:39.469 --> 03:41.753
- Wendell.
- COMPUTER VOICE: Joseph.

03:41.754 --> 03:44.315
It's just Joe.
I think you know that.

03:44.316 --> 03:46.466
My Thanksgiving's
also a nightmare.

03:46.467 --> 03:50.220
Donna's cousins are two-thirds
of Tony! Toni! Toné!

03:50.221 --> 03:52.264
- Which ones?
- The "E" and the "I."

03:52.265 --> 03:54.015
Aw, no Tony with a "Y."

03:54.016 --> 03:55.225
That is correct.

03:55.226 --> 03:57.319
We lack the alpha Tony.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.563
Well, at least you guys
celebrate with your families.

03:59.564 --> 04:02.875
Last year I spent Thanksgiving
with my old blow-up sex dolls.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.317
Here you go, Carla.

04:04.318 --> 04:06.328
See? We can do
other things together.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.405
How's the turkey?
I made it myself.

04:08.406 --> 04:10.675
Oh, don't look so surprised.

04:10.676 --> 04:11.967
(air hissing)

04:11.968 --> 04:13.502
Ah. Someone's getting sleepy.

04:13.503 --> 04:14.703
Must be the tryptophan.

04:14.704 --> 04:16.346
I'll put a pot of coffee on.

04:16.348 --> 04:18.248
Janet, coffee? Carla, coffee?

04:18.249 --> 04:20.259
Dina, coffee? Sasha, coffee?

04:20.260 --> 04:22.002
Dad, coffee?

04:22.003 --> 04:24.671
I wish I had given you
more siblings, Glenn.

04:24.672 --> 04:26.965
You know, sometimes I envy
the guys in the town jail.

04:26.966 --> 04:28.800
They get a turkey dinner
on Quahog

04:28.801 --> 04:31.261
and don't have the hassle
of hosting their families.

04:31.262 --> 04:33.063
Well, yeah,
but they're in prison.

04:33.064 --> 04:35.932
Nah, jail isn't prison.
Prison is big and scary.

04:35.933 --> 04:39.227
Jail is just a sleeping deputy
with keys that can be grabbed

04:39.228 --> 04:41.905
by a long broom handle
or a mischievous dog.

04:41.906 --> 04:43.949
Do black people ever go to jail?

04:43.950 --> 04:45.734
No. They go to prison.

04:45.735 --> 04:48.361
Well, maybe going to jail
is what we should do.

04:48.362 --> 04:50.947
- Peter, that's ridiculous.
- H-H-Hear me out, hear me out.

04:50.948 --> 04:52.174
We'll commit a small crime

04:52.175 --> 04:54.743
and get put in jail
for a couple days.

04:54.744 --> 04:56.804
- That's insane!
- Peter, Peter, you're crazy!

04:56.805 --> 04:58.447
-Ridiculous!
-Unconscionable!
<i>-Lump Monkeys!</i>

04:58.448 --> 05:00.582
-Have you lost your mind?
-That's crazy!
<i>-Lump Monkeys!</i>

05:00.583 --> 05:02.667
<i>All right, Joe,</i>
<i>there's chaos at the top.</i>

05:02.668 --> 05:04.645
<i>Time to step up</i>
<i>and be the leader</i>

05:04.646 --> 05:06.731
<i>- of this group of friends.</i>
- PETER: <i> Lump Monkeys!</i>

05:06.732 --> 05:08.773
Guys, what if we all go
to Vermont?

05:10.018 --> 05:12.235
Let's just do Peter's thing.

05:14.239 --> 05:15.931
Okay, if we want to
get arrested,

05:15.932 --> 05:18.350
the best way to do it is
to get caught on the Ring app

05:18.351 --> 05:20.227
stealing people's packages.

05:20.228 --> 05:22.162
(no audio)

05:24.000 --> 05:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:44.502 --> 05:45.770
I forgot to steal the package.

05:45.771 --> 05:47.671
I think this is
probably enough.

05:47.672 --> 05:50.674
I don't know exactly
what this is,

05:50.675 --> 05:53.060
but this... this is crime.

05:53.061 --> 05:54.427
MAN:
Swanson!

05:54.428 --> 05:56.814
Police Superintendent Chalmers.

05:56.815 --> 05:59.983
My brother is superintendent
of the schools in Springfield.

05:59.984 --> 06:02.778
Our parents divorced
when we were very young.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.747
I was raised entirely
by our mother,

06:04.748 --> 06:06.064
he by our father.

06:06.065 --> 06:09.192
We've never met.
There's a lot of backstory.

06:09.193 --> 06:11.653
And you four
are under arrest.

06:11.654 --> 06:13.004
(all gasp)

06:16.033 --> 06:17.960
I can't believe the plan worked.

06:17.961 --> 06:20.470
Here we are,
the city jail.

06:22.915 --> 06:25.333
What's going on?
Why aren't we stopping?

06:25.334 --> 06:27.636
You guys think you're the
first ones to have this idea?

06:27.637 --> 06:30.881
The jail's already full of dads
getting out of Thanksgiving.

06:30.882 --> 06:32.933
Well, if we're not going
to Quahog jail,

06:32.934 --> 06:34.342
where are we going?

06:34.343 --> 06:36.553
The only place where
there's room for the weekend:

06:36.554 --> 06:37.737
the state penitentiary.

06:39.557 --> 06:41.700
You guys thinking
what I'm thinking?

06:41.701 --> 06:44.352
Wacky mug shot montage.

06:44.353 --> 06:46.330
(upbeat music playing)

06:46.331 --> 06:48.289
¶ ¶

06:50.919 --> 06:52.670
Hey, uh, are my friends coming?

06:52.671 --> 06:54.362
No, they're all calling lawyers.

06:54.363 --> 06:57.699
You used your one call on
this party photo booth guy.

06:57.700 --> 07:00.134
Eh, we'll see who has
more fun this weekend.

07:04.457 --> 07:07.183
¶ ¶

07:12.798 --> 07:14.549
Yeah, it just doesn't
seem right.

07:14.550 --> 07:16.134
We're in here,
and everyone on Wall Street

07:16.135 --> 07:17.802
is free as a bird.

07:17.803 --> 07:21.056
Joe, now is not the time for
your bland political musings.

07:21.057 --> 07:23.850
This sucks. The courts are
closed for Thanksgiving,

07:23.851 --> 07:26.194
which means we can't even
go before a judge till Monday.

07:26.195 --> 07:28.021
That's five whole days here.

07:28.022 --> 07:29.981
What the hell
are we gonna do?

07:29.982 --> 07:32.585
Well, if we're congress,
we'll do nothing.

07:32.586 --> 07:35.320
All right, that one was sharp.
Good job, Joe.

07:35.321 --> 07:37.631
And you know, maybe-maybe prison
won't be so bad.

07:37.632 --> 07:39.166
Maybe we just got to
make the best of it.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.651
Like those guys
over there. Look.

07:40.652 --> 07:44.138
They're playing leapfrog.
No one's jumping, though.

07:44.139 --> 07:46.548
And that guy in the back
definitely has to get up higher.

07:46.549 --> 07:47.832
Who taught these guys
how to play?

07:47.833 --> 07:49.501
Peter, please stop watching it.

07:49.502 --> 07:51.795
Guys, I think we're
in trouble here.

07:51.796 --> 07:53.138
Come on, we're gonna be fine.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.065
Joe, you should be
more terrified than any of us.

07:55.066 --> 07:57.050
What if someone figures out
you're a cop?

07:57.051 --> 07:59.320
It's not gonna happen.
I spent years undercover.

07:59.321 --> 08:01.605
I'm a master of disguise.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.240
What? You're in a wheelchair.

08:03.241 --> 08:05.016
You can't disguise yourself
as anything.

08:05.017 --> 08:07.453
(imitating Chris):
Is that so,<i> Dad?</i>

08:07.454 --> 08:09.663
Chris? But that's impossible.

08:09.664 --> 08:11.856
I've seen Chris standing up
many times.

08:11.857 --> 08:13.334
(as Chris):
Have you?

08:13.335 --> 08:15.694
Hey, Chris, I got two tickets
for the Sox.

08:15.695 --> 08:18.571
- Want to go?
- You got it, Dad.

08:18.572 --> 08:20.532
Oh, charley horse.

08:20.533 --> 08:22.200
Oh, another charley horse, huh?

08:22.201 --> 08:23.576
Well, you sit tight, Chris.

08:23.577 --> 08:25.511
I can just take Joe's
brother-in-law Wendell.

08:26.539 --> 08:28.164
COMPUTER VOICE:
Christopher.

08:28.165 --> 08:31.726
It's just Chris.
I think you know that.

08:36.674 --> 08:39.174
The conjugal visit room
is being used.

08:39.176 --> 08:41.010
So, does your foot reach?

08:41.011 --> 08:43.155
Peter, enough.
You ruined Thanksgiving.

08:43.155 --> 08:45.573
I have to host 20 people
by myself.

08:46.576 --> 08:48.268
- You smoke now?
- Yeah.

08:48.269 --> 08:49.578
I have a husband in prison.

08:49.579 --> 08:51.496
That's who smokes, genius.

08:54.250 --> 08:57.444
Stewie, why do you look like
1976 Elton John?

08:57.445 --> 08:59.204
I'm trying to keep
a low profile.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.114
You know that old
sitcom premise

09:01.115 --> 09:03.074
where the kid has
two dates to the prom?

09:03.075 --> 09:04.501
Well, I, um...

09:04.502 --> 09:08.121
I may sorta, kinda be engaged
to four prisoners.

09:08.122 --> 09:09.923
You're what?
Stewie, that's crazy.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.684
Oh, relax, Brian,
I'm just humoring them.

09:11.685 --> 09:12.876
It's not serious.

09:12.877 --> 09:14.428
Stewie, don't forget,

09:14.429 --> 09:16.046
we're meeting DJs tomorrow.

09:16.047 --> 09:18.089
Sure thing, Clint.

09:18.090 --> 09:19.841
His mother thinks
it's <i> her</i> wedding.

09:19.842 --> 09:21.068
But we'll see.

09:21.069 --> 09:22.686
How did you even meet
these guys?

09:22.687 --> 09:24.429
Easily.
They were my pen pals.

09:24.430 --> 09:25.939
You have prison pen pals?

09:25.940 --> 09:27.682
Yes. A lot of people
write prisoners.

09:27.683 --> 09:29.952
Even Hollywood celebrity
Kal Penn.

09:29.953 --> 09:31.611
Kal Penn writes a prisoner?

09:31.612 --> 09:33.539
Yeah. Ken.
Lives in California.

09:33.540 --> 09:35.541
You've never heard of
Kal Penn's pen pal Ken

09:35.542 --> 09:36.783
in the Cal pen?

09:36.784 --> 09:38.568
How could I possibly
have heard of Kal Penn's

09:38.569 --> 09:39.778
pen pal Ken in the Cal pen?

09:39.779 --> 09:41.255
Through this song.

09:41.256 --> 09:43.782
¶<i> Well, I do get a yen</i>
<i>every now and then</i> ¶

09:43.783 --> 09:45.667
¶<i> To pick up a pen,</i>
<i>like my pal Kal Penn</i> ¶

09:45.668 --> 09:47.535
¶<i> And a note I will send</i>
<i>every now and again</i> ¶

09:47.536 --> 09:49.755
¶<i> To my pal Big Ben</i>
<i>who is locked in the pen</i> ¶

09:49.756 --> 09:51.715
¶<i> 'Cause he beat up some men</i>
<i>and he got five to ten</i> ¶

09:51.716 --> 09:53.041
¶<i> And he'll do it again</i> ¶

09:53.042 --> 09:54.009
¶<i> Dah, dah, dah-dah-dah</i> ¶

09:54.010 --> 09:55.327
¶<i> Kal Penn.</i> ¶

09:55.328 --> 09:57.420
- Who was that for?
- What are you talking about?

09:57.421 --> 09:59.005
Phil Spector's in this prison.

09:59.006 --> 10:02.217
Kid, I know talent and shooting
waitresses in the mouth,

10:02.218 --> 10:03.676
and you've got talent.

10:03.677 --> 10:05.278
We're gonna make a record.

10:10.493 --> 10:12.452
¶ ¶

10:19.568 --> 10:22.212
God, every crevice
of this prison is terrifying.

10:22.213 --> 10:23.655
Eh, it's not so bad.

10:23.656 --> 10:25.865
I made one-eye contact
with Bill Cosby.

10:25.866 --> 10:27.659
Well, well, well.

10:27.660 --> 10:30.345
Three "wells" is never
a good sign.

10:30.346 --> 10:33.006
- I think you guys
have our lunches.
- Called it.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.999
Uh, sorry, sir.
We don't want any trouble.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.843
Yeah, we-we'll sit
somewhere else.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.628
Come on, guys,
let's avoid confrontation.

10:38.629 --> 10:39.846
And whatever happens,

10:39.847 --> 10:41.857
let's make sure
we're not goaded into fights

10:41.858 --> 10:44.101
by simple playground taunts.

10:44.102 --> 10:46.778
Damn.
I was hoping for chicken.

10:47.822 --> 10:51.683
Nobody calls me chicken.

10:51.684 --> 10:53.409
- Peter, no!
- (blows landing)

10:55.813 --> 10:57.948
Aw, damn it,
I lost a front tooth.

10:57.949 --> 10:59.958
Well, hopefully
in the prison yearbook

10:59.959 --> 11:01.959
I'll just look
like a cute kindergartner.

11:05.456 --> 11:07.423
<i>PETER (reading):</i>

11:17.969 --> 11:19.061
I'm starving.

11:19.062 --> 11:20.628
We haven't eaten
since we got here.

11:20.629 --> 11:22.856
That's 'cause other prisoners
keep taking our meals.

11:22.857 --> 11:24.691
And God knows what else
they're gonna do to us.

11:24.692 --> 11:26.226
We have three more days here,

11:26.227 --> 11:27.927
and we're not gonna survive
three more minutes.

11:27.928 --> 11:29.321
That's 'cause
you don't have a gang

11:29.322 --> 11:31.156
- to protect you.
- A gang?

11:31.157 --> 11:33.316
Yeah, when you're in a gang,
no one will mess with you.

11:33.317 --> 11:34.985
That's why everyone joins one.

11:34.986 --> 11:36.453
I used to be in a gang.

11:36.454 --> 11:38.572
It was called
the Republican party.

11:38.573 --> 11:40.582
Our friend is very political.

11:40.583 --> 11:42.734
So, how do we get
into one of these gangs?

11:42.735 --> 11:44.753
Actually, you guys showed up
at the perfect time.

11:44.754 --> 11:46.663
Tomorrow is the start
of Prison Rush Week.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.573
Get in one,
and you're home free.

11:48.574 --> 11:50.450
That's a great idea!

11:50.451 --> 11:53.845
Let's celebrate by pretentiously
analyzing some prison wine.

11:55.390 --> 11:56.956
(sniffs)

11:56.957 --> 12:00.727
Okay, I'm getting notes
of, um...

12:00.728 --> 12:02.770
uh, well, feces.

12:09.386 --> 12:11.237
¶ ¶

12:13.024 --> 12:15.025
Man, getting in a gang

12:15.026 --> 12:16.535
is gonna be harder
than I thought.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.361
JOE:
Speak for yourself, Peter.

12:18.362 --> 12:20.230
What gang is this?

12:20.231 --> 12:21.564
We're the Not Cops.

12:21.565 --> 12:24.576
We're all <i> definitely</i> not cops.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.194
So you think firemen are cool?

12:26.195 --> 12:29.322
Firemen cook spaghetti.

12:29.323 --> 12:31.866
And I think y'all know
who I joined.

12:31.867 --> 12:33.743
Are you now
Kareem Abdul-Jableeveland?

12:33.744 --> 12:36.037
I am Kareem Abdul-Jableeveland.

12:36.038 --> 12:38.089
Hey, you know Muslims
can't drink alcohol, right?

12:38.090 --> 12:41.101
I am Cleveland
"Hurricane" Carter.

12:41.102 --> 12:43.544
Well, Quagmire,
guess it's just you and me now.

12:43.545 --> 12:45.606
Sorry, Peter, I'm in MS-13.

12:45.607 --> 12:47.382
- What? How?
- It was easy.

12:47.383 --> 12:49.717
- I said I was loco.
- Loco!

12:49.718 --> 12:51.344
<i>- Si.</i>
<i>- Muy</i> loco.

12:51.345 --> 12:52.738
Well, I can be loco.

12:52.739 --> 12:54.722
I have a teardrop tattoo
on my cheek.

12:54.723 --> 12:55.982
Where? I don't see it.

12:55.983 --> 12:57.074
Not-not that cheek.

12:58.386 --> 13:00.603
Peter, that's
an unwiped watermelon seed.

13:00.604 --> 13:03.323
- Loco?
- No. No loco.

13:03.324 --> 13:06.109
Hey, Peter,
is that your baby over there?

13:06.110 --> 13:07.944
(dialogue inaudible)

13:07.945 --> 13:10.613
We want fun. We want upbeat.
And for our dance,

13:10.614 --> 13:13.032
we want "You Belong with Me"
by Taylor Swift.

13:13.033 --> 13:15.535
Great, great. I also have
some more classic options,

13:15.536 --> 13:17.870
- like "At Last."
- (chuckles) Okay.

13:17.871 --> 13:21.582
So... so, what I need
is someone I can work with.

13:21.583 --> 13:24.101
Can you be that person?

13:26.588 --> 13:28.774
¶ ¶

13:28.775 --> 13:31.050
There you guys are.
I haven't seen you all day.

13:31.051 --> 13:33.311
Me and the Not Cops
were watching <i> Die Hard</i>

13:33.312 --> 13:35.063
and <i> not</i> commenting

13:35.064 --> 13:37.282
on the believability
of the police work.

13:37.283 --> 13:39.892
Could John McClane
really foil a giant heist

13:39.893 --> 13:42.079
outside his jurisdiction,
then just walk away

13:42.080 --> 13:43.771
and do zero paperwork?

13:43.772 --> 13:46.041
We don't know or care,
'cause we're not cops.

13:46.042 --> 13:47.942
And I got my law degree.

13:47.943 --> 13:51.279
I am now
Cleveland J. Roman J. Israel,

13:51.280 --> 13:53.865
and I will be wearing
wine-colored suits.

13:53.866 --> 13:56.176
- You look crazy.
- Well, in his defense,

13:56.177 --> 13:58.461
the movie was set in the '70s,
wasn't it?

13:58.462 --> 13:59.963
No, it's modern-day.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.289
Oh, my stars.

14:01.290 --> 14:03.499
All right, everyone,
that's lanch.

14:03.500 --> 14:05.685
I mean, lunch.
Sorry, it's my first day.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.555
This sucks.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.423
Everyone's eating lanch but me.

14:10.424 --> 14:12.216
I'm never gonna find a gang.

14:12.217 --> 14:14.635
Hey. You look like
you could use a friend.

14:14.636 --> 14:17.263
Well, let's just say in prison,

14:17.264 --> 14:19.515
this guy comes off.

14:19.516 --> 14:21.768
I meant my gang.
We're looking for members.

14:21.769 --> 14:24.062
- I-I bet you'd fit right in.
- Really?

14:24.063 --> 14:25.563
You only have to do
one thing first.

14:25.564 --> 14:27.291
As the new white guy in prison,

14:27.292 --> 14:29.041
you have to shiv
the new black guy.

14:32.246 --> 14:35.073
Oh, you guys
are <i> that</i> kind of gang.

14:35.074 --> 14:36.249
This is prison.

14:36.250 --> 14:37.867
No one survives on their own.

14:37.868 --> 14:40.703
So it's either him or you.

14:40.704 --> 14:42.663
Man, I don't want
to hurt Cleveland.

14:42.664 --> 14:45.183
But I don't want to die.
And it would be nice

14:45.184 --> 14:47.853
to have people to go
to Smash Mouth concerts with.

14:47.854 --> 14:49.929
Wait, you guys go
to Smash Mouth concerts, right?

14:49.930 --> 14:53.107
We're Nazis, Peter.
We like Smash Mouth.

14:58.263 --> 15:00.681
¶ ¶

15:00.682 --> 15:02.725
Come on, there's got to be a way
you'll let me in the gang

15:02.726 --> 15:04.136
without shivving Cleveland.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.580
Ooh, ooh, I got an idea.
There was this prison movie,

15:06.581 --> 15:08.415
and-and there was this guy
who wanted to win over

15:08.416 --> 15:10.441
the other prisoners,
and you know what he did?

15:10.442 --> 15:13.111
He ate seven eggs.
It was amazing.

15:13.112 --> 15:14.445
So, you bring me seven

15:14.446 --> 15:16.406
or some other reasonable amount
of eggs...

15:16.407 --> 15:17.949
Peter, I know it's 50 eggs.

15:17.950 --> 15:19.492
Ah, you're a film buff.

15:19.493 --> 15:23.171
Yeah. Before this, I was
in the USC directors program.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.580
Well, if you can call it that.

15:24.581 --> 15:26.132
You think you're learning
about film,

15:26.133 --> 15:28.894
but, really, you're getting
a degree in politics.

15:28.895 --> 15:30.645
(scoffs) I know,
everything is so political.

15:30.646 --> 15:33.047
<i>So</i> political.
Best advice I ever got:

15:33.048 --> 15:35.275
whatever business
you think you work in,

15:35.276 --> 15:36.634
you really work in sales.

15:36.635 --> 15:38.636
Because you're
always selling yourself.

15:38.637 --> 15:40.638
Yeah, wow, that is...
that is good.

15:40.639 --> 15:43.191
- You are smart.
- Well, I didn't say it.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.767
- I'm just repeating it.
- Well, still,

15:44.768 --> 15:46.185
y-you recognized its value.

15:46.186 --> 15:47.787
That-That's not nothing.

15:50.941 --> 15:53.109
Well, we're so happy
you're all here.

15:53.110 --> 15:54.777
We thought it might be fun

15:54.778 --> 15:57.455
to kick things off
with a game of Heads Up!

15:57.456 --> 15:59.282
- Daddy, do you want to start?
- No.

15:59.283 --> 16:01.009
You just hold this up
to your head,

16:01.010 --> 16:04.245
and then we're gonna give you
clues to help you guess it.

16:04.246 --> 16:05.931
I only like games with sticks.

16:05.932 --> 16:07.432
Okay, ready?

16:07.433 --> 16:08.808
Go.

16:10.711 --> 16:12.270
(chuckles):
Okay. It's a show.

16:12.271 --> 16:13.379
<i>Annie Get Your Gun.</i>

16:13.380 --> 16:14.472
No, it's on TV.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.591
Oh.<i> Poirot?</i>

16:16.592 --> 16:18.568
What is that?
I've never heard of that.

16:18.569 --> 16:21.471
Uh, it's a Belgian detective
on PBS.

16:21.472 --> 16:22.805
We just love it.

16:22.806 --> 16:25.826
It's about seven castaways.
There's a professor

16:25.827 --> 16:28.027
a-and a millionaire
a-and a movie star.

16:28.028 --> 16:29.028
<i>- Poirot!</i>
- No.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.455
We already said it's not <i> Poirot.</i>

16:30.456 --> 16:32.857
It's about people who took
a three-hour tour.

16:32.858 --> 16:34.409
No, it's not.
It's about a Belgian detective.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.685
It's on PBS.

16:35.686 --> 16:38.529
The title character is played
by Bob Denver.

16:38.530 --> 16:41.032
- It's pronounced "David Suchet."
- Who's that?

16:41.033 --> 16:43.969
- I'm gonna guess Poirot.
- It's not <i> Poirot!</i>

16:43.970 --> 16:45.553
Damn it, just pass!

16:48.307 --> 16:49.749
Okay, this is a movie...

16:49.750 --> 16:51.626
<i>Roman J. Israel, Esq.</i>

16:51.627 --> 16:52.685
ALL: Yay!

17:01.946 --> 17:03.779
¶ ¶

17:05.766 --> 17:07.608
Come on, Peter, it's him or you.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.727
And-and he's not so great.

17:09.728 --> 17:11.054
Don't forget,
he's the one who told you

17:11.055 --> 17:12.855
all those <i> Schoolhouse Rock!</i>
spoilers.

17:12.856 --> 17:14.982
I had no idea
that bill would become a law.

17:14.983 --> 17:16.409
- (screams)
- Sorry, Peter.

17:16.410 --> 17:17.902
My gang said
I wasn't really loco

17:17.903 --> 17:19.319
unless I shivved someone,

17:19.320 --> 17:21.923
and you're the one guy
without gang protection, so...

17:21.924 --> 17:23.583
- (screams)
- Sorry, Quagmire.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.285
As a Not Cop, I have to shiv
a guy in the Latin gang

17:26.286 --> 17:28.663
and then blame it on Cleve...
(screams)

17:28.664 --> 17:30.456
No one made me do this.

17:30.457 --> 17:33.309
I'm just sick
of your overt racism.

17:36.088 --> 17:37.597
Guys, guys, stop.

17:37.598 --> 17:39.382
Stop. Look at us.

17:39.383 --> 17:41.842
We're shivving each other
on Thanksgiving.

17:41.843 --> 17:43.653
Oh, wait,
no one shivved Cleveland.

17:43.654 --> 17:44.821
(screams)

17:44.822 --> 17:46.597
But what are we doing?

17:46.598 --> 17:47.699
What are all of us doing?

17:47.700 --> 17:49.976
Fighting in here
amongst ourselves

17:49.977 --> 17:52.311
while Brooks is out there
waiting for all of us,

17:52.312 --> 17:53.471
bagging groceries,

17:53.472 --> 17:55.707
adapting to this new world
seamlessly...

17:55.708 --> 17:57.066
(whispers):
Brooks hung himself.

17:57.067 --> 17:58.484
Oh, my stars.

17:58.485 --> 18:00.003
The point is, in life,

18:00.004 --> 18:02.830
you need to be thankful
for what you have.

18:02.831 --> 18:05.741
I wasn't, and it got me in here.

18:05.742 --> 18:09.537
I let down my family,
especially my wife.

18:09.538 --> 18:12.373
I just wish she was here
so I could tell her I'm sorry.

18:12.374 --> 18:14.000
LOIS:
I am here, Peter.

18:14.001 --> 18:16.803
Not now, prison ladyboy
who talks like my wife

18:16.804 --> 18:18.254
to please me sexually.

18:18.255 --> 18:20.022
LOIS:
No, Peter, we're here.

18:21.550 --> 18:23.810
Lois! What are you doing here?

18:23.811 --> 18:25.770
I thought you were having
Thanksgiving with your parents.

18:25.771 --> 18:28.198
Chris got caught
watching cousin Katie pee,

18:28.199 --> 18:29.774
so that kind of ended things.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.701
Well, I wanted to get caught.
That's...

18:31.702 --> 18:33.370
It's part of it.

18:33.371 --> 18:36.623
And the truth is, Peter,
we're not a family without you.

18:36.624 --> 18:38.232
Can you ever forgive me?

18:38.233 --> 18:40.526
Of course I can, Peter.

18:40.527 --> 18:41.869
(in Lois' voice):
Hi, Peter.

18:41.870 --> 18:43.779
Who's your little friend?

18:43.780 --> 18:45.081
Not now, Prison Lois.

18:45.082 --> 18:46.490
So it's over?

18:46.491 --> 18:48.034
And what was Venice?

18:48.035 --> 18:49.785
Same thing it always was, babe:

18:49.786 --> 18:52.246
a dream
we both wanted to believe.

18:52.247 --> 18:54.933
(crying)

18:54.934 --> 18:56.292
Peter, who was that?

18:56.293 --> 18:58.210
Not now, Front-Sex Lois.

18:58.211 --> 19:00.880
The important thing is,
my days of selfishness

19:00.881 --> 19:02.757
and red-wig twinks are over.

19:02.758 --> 19:05.143
I'm ready to come home with you.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.053
But, Peter,
you're in here till next week.

19:07.054 --> 19:08.980
MAN:
Not anymore.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.273
Hi, I'm the warden

19:10.274 --> 19:12.609
and definitely not
a psychotic prisoner

19:12.610 --> 19:14.777
who just stabbed the warden
and stole his clothes.

19:14.778 --> 19:17.405
Shh, shh!
Everyone, the warden's talking.

19:17.406 --> 19:19.616
By the rules of prison
and <i> The Love Boat,</i>

19:19.617 --> 19:21.117
you've made up,

19:21.118 --> 19:24.420
which means you get to leave
wiser and happier.

19:34.956 --> 19:36.957
I love you, Lois.

19:36.958 --> 19:38.684
I love you, Peter.

19:42.130 --> 19:44.757
Hey, Lois, one day,
let's go to Venice.

19:44.758 --> 19:46.184
You promise?

19:46.185 --> 19:48.360
I said it, didn't I?

19:49.471 --> 19:50.739
Donna!

19:50.740 --> 19:51.856
Bonnie!

19:51.857 --> 19:53.191
Sex doll!

19:53.192 --> 19:56.143
- Oh, yeah!
- (cheering and whooping)

19:56.144 --> 19:58.787
(chuckles):
All right, guys, settle down.

20:05.070 --> 20:07.405
Well, we're certainly glad
to have you home, Peter,

20:07.406 --> 20:08.882
but I hope
you learned your lesson.

20:08.883 --> 20:10.700
I learned a hard lesson, Lois.

20:10.701 --> 20:12.126
But it's not all bad.

20:12.127 --> 20:14.379
I got to make a license plate
for our car

20:14.380 --> 20:15.496
that says "butthole."

20:15.497 --> 20:16.964
Isn't that too many letters?

20:16.965 --> 20:19.291
Excellent question, Chris,
and yes, it is.

20:19.292 --> 20:21.936
But I took off a "T"
and the "E" at the end.

20:21.937 --> 20:23.879
I felt
that was the right way to go.

20:23.880 --> 20:26.933
Trust me, people will get it.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.610
What's buthol?

20:28.611 --> 20:29.969
PETER:
That's not how you say it.

20:29.970 --> 20:31.020
Yeah, I've heard of buthol.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.614
It's some kind
of alternative fuel.

20:32.615 --> 20:34.908
PETER:
You're ruining a smart joke.

20:34.909 --> 20:36.517
<i>DJ:</i>
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

20:36.518 --> 20:38.945

20:38.946 --> 20:41.039
Mr. and Mrs. Clint Beltran!

20:41.040 --> 20:42.374

by Etta James playing)

20:42.375 --> 20:45.284

20:45.285 --> 20:48.212
¶<i> At last...</i> ¶

20:50.007 --> 20:51.165
