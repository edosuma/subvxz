01:06.442 --> 01:08.234
In here.

01:34.052 --> 01:35.470
Hey!

01:35.637 --> 01:38.347
Hey! Hey! What about him?

01:39.767 --> 01:41.350
What about him?

01:58.494 --> 02:00.161
Hey. Someone.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.707
Help. Assistance.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.794
This man needs help.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.045
This man pays my salary.

02:38.367 --> 02:40.493
Forty-point-two-three pounds.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.210
Are they back yet?

02:49.378 --> 02:51.712
Have you heard from anyone?

02:53.423 --> 02:55.591
If Pinkman is gone...

02:56.051 --> 02:59.470
...I'm done. Do you understand?
I quit.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.941
I just told you, 40.23 pounds.

03:15.988 --> 03:19.073
Forty-point-two-one.

03:41.638 --> 03:46.058
My brother-in-law, he keeps talking
about driving out to the factory farm.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.687
And I have... l have stalled him
as long as I possibly can.

03:49.855 --> 03:51.814
It's really at the point now...

03:51.982 --> 03:55.067
...where he's gonna find someone else
to take him there.

03:55.235 --> 03:58.487
So I don't know
if it's been made presentable yet.

03:58.655 --> 04:02.617
But I should be the one
to take him out there, right?

04:07.414 --> 04:10.374
Can you just run it up
the chain of command then?

04:25.140 --> 04:26.515
Anything suspicious?

04:28.310 --> 04:30.728
Still no, walt.

04:33.941 --> 04:37.401
Well, then should we go?

04:38.528 --> 04:42.615
Got some place to be? Because it's,
like, the third time you asked me that.

04:42.783 --> 04:46.827
No, I'm just curious
what the next move is.

04:46.995 --> 04:50.206
Our next three moves
is sitting here and waiting.

04:50.374 --> 04:52.291
This here's the job, buddy.

04:52.459 --> 04:56.587
Ain't all supermodels and speedboats,
you know.

04:59.800 --> 05:04.345
Any cartel news these days?

05:04.513 --> 05:09.183
Seems like I'm always reading
something or other in the paper.

05:09.726 --> 05:13.145
Yeah, well,
not a lot happening stateside.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.482
Hearing rumblings
about some big play down south.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.193
Lots of bodies, apparently.

05:19.361 --> 05:22.029
You know, even by cartel standards.

05:22.864 --> 05:26.951
We'll know more
when the buzzards leave the bones.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.625
So when we gonna talk
about your face?

05:38.255 --> 05:41.424
- I don't wanna get into it, okay?
- No, it's not okay.

05:41.591 --> 05:44.635
My brother-in-law shows up
looking like Macho Camacho...

05:44.803 --> 05:47.179
...and he thinks
we're not gonna discuss it?

05:54.730 --> 05:59.316
You know, one of my old buddies
from Glynco had a gambling problem...

05:59.484 --> 06:05.197
...except his thing was scratch cards
instead of blackjack.

06:05.782 --> 06:10.953
Dumb Okie bastard had his car repo'd
playing scratch-and-wins.

06:12.414 --> 06:16.459
He's fine now, you know.
He got help and all.

06:17.377 --> 06:22.339
But I know he got on a ride
that was rough to get off of.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.468
I'm just saying I'm here, you know.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.887
If you want to talk about it.

06:31.683 --> 06:36.520
I don't want to talk about it,
to you or to anyone else.

06:36.855 --> 06:39.398
I'm done explaining myself.

07:06.301 --> 07:10.554
Hey, you think he needs more blood?

07:11.014 --> 07:12.723
It's in the refrigerator.

07:13.517 --> 07:16.519
What, you...? You want me to...?

07:30.033 --> 07:32.201
A-negative, yes?

07:33.537 --> 07:34.870
Your blood type?

07:36.790 --> 07:38.874
I don't know, maybe.

07:40.377 --> 07:43.087
A-negative, 25 years old...

07:43.255 --> 07:46.924
...seventy kilo, 180 centimeters.

07:47.092 --> 07:52.471
You smoke, you drink,
you puff, puff, puff.

07:53.098 --> 07:55.516
But no disease, no condition.

07:56.351 --> 07:59.645
No complication
other than an allergy to...

07:59.813 --> 08:01.105
Oh, wait, don't say.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.691
Erythromycin.

08:03.859 --> 08:07.945
But I have cefazolin here,
so no problem.

08:09.072 --> 08:10.114
How do you know all that?

08:16.204 --> 08:17.997
Jesus.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.499
He thought of everything.

08:26.464 --> 08:28.424
O-negative.

08:28.592 --> 08:30.176
That's what he needs.

08:36.308 --> 08:38.308
It's time to go.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.102
What about Mike?

08:41.605 --> 08:45.441
With this injury? No travel.
At least a week.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.612
I'll send for him.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.206
You need protection, Gustavo?

09:04.127 --> 09:06.295
I wouldn't have guessed.

09:13.803 --> 09:16.096
Water and rest.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.296
What happened to the plane?

09:51.758 --> 09:53.884
There are many good ways south.

09:54.052 --> 09:57.096
But, unfortunately, only one way north.

09:59.557 --> 10:01.976
Six miles to Texas.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.604
I've got a man there
who'll drive us the rest of the way.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.318
I kind of liked the plane.

10:14.406 --> 10:17.658
So you gonna make it?
Six miles is pretty far.

10:17.826 --> 10:19.702
I'll make it.

10:23.707 --> 10:25.374
You did well down here.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.876
And you also proved a point.

10:29.713 --> 10:33.340
I think you can run the lab
by yourself now.

10:33.508 --> 10:35.175
Don't you?

10:41.891 --> 10:44.184
Let Mr. White go.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.939
Pay him off or fire him.

10:49.399 --> 10:50.899
Don't kill him.

10:54.154 --> 10:57.781
- You know that won't work.
- Then you got a problem.

11:17.052 --> 11:20.054
Hi. We're home.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.683
Are you doing your homework?

11:24.851 --> 11:26.560
Yeah.

11:27.520 --> 11:31.190
Well, dinner is in about 30.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.612
Hey, sorry to call you at home...

11:36.780 --> 11:39.907
...but I think maybe
you're not getting my messages.

11:40.075 --> 11:43.494
That or you just
don't feel like talking to me.

11:43.787 --> 11:47.331
Anyway, why I've been calling
is because that thing we discussed?

11:47.499 --> 11:49.500
Well, I've been thinking...

11:49.667 --> 11:54.671
...and I decided I can't do it. That's
probably not what you wanted to hear.

11:54.839 --> 11:57.049
But hopefully you'll understand...

11:57.217 --> 12:00.344
...and if you want to talk more about it,
that's fine.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.763
So call me. I'm around.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.489
- Hey. Come on in.
- Hi.

12:26.538 --> 12:30.707
First, I wanna tell you that I get it.

12:30.875 --> 12:36.380
From what you've told me, this situation
with wait's gambling sounds...

12:36.881 --> 12:38.799
...intense.

12:39.134 --> 12:42.761
Yeah, it definitely was.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.014
And continues to be.

12:48.351 --> 12:53.689
So I would greatly appreciate it
if you would just...

12:53.857 --> 12:55.649
...help me out here.

12:55.817 --> 12:59.027
Well, I've thought long and hard
about this...

13:01.531 --> 13:03.657
...and here's what I want to do.

13:08.371 --> 13:11.290
So is Walt gonna be okay?

13:11.458 --> 13:13.167
Are you in contact with him?

13:13.835 --> 13:15.252
He's fine.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.921
Good. That's good.

13:20.133 --> 13:23.385
- He doesn't know about you offering...?
- No. Absolutely not.

13:23.553 --> 13:27.347
And I mean to keep it that way, so...

13:27.515 --> 13:34.480
Six hundred and seventeen
thousand dollars written out to me.

13:37.692 --> 13:40.861
- What is this?
- I can't take your money.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.531
- And why is that?
- Because, at the end of the day...

13:44.699 --> 13:49.661
...paying my debt
with illicit gambling winnings...

13:50.663 --> 13:52.706
I don't know, it feels wrong.

13:53.416 --> 13:54.708
"It feels wrong"?

13:54.876 --> 13:56.668
To me it does.

13:56.836 --> 14:01.173
I'm not judging you or Walt. I'm
just saying I feel uncomfortable with it.

14:01.341 --> 14:05.135
Well, Ted, the whole reason
we're in this mess...

14:05.303 --> 14:08.263
...is because you had me
cooking your books.

14:08.431 --> 14:13.227
So when did wrong
suddenly become a problem for you?

14:13.394 --> 14:15.896
Now, hold on,
that was a one-time measure...

14:16.064 --> 14:18.607
...in an honest attempt
to protect my employees...

14:18.775 --> 14:20.359
...and save my dad's company.

14:20.527 --> 14:24.696
It might've been a mistake, but that's
no reason to go out and make another.

14:24.864 --> 14:28.534
No, Ted, this is the big mistake,
right here.

14:28.993 --> 14:34.498
You owe the federal government
$617,000. if you do not pay them...

14:34.666 --> 14:38.168
...they will come after you
and then they will come after me.

14:38.336 --> 14:43.382
And if they audit my business,
find out that Walt and I paid for it...

14:43.550 --> 14:47.511
...with close to a million dollars
in untaxed gambling winnings...

14:47.679 --> 14:52.224
...we will go to prison, where you will
already be. Do you understand?

14:52.392 --> 14:56.520
I understand you're upset, but I think
you're overstating things too.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.063
No one's going to prison.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.732
Oh, my God.
How are you not following me here?

15:00.900 --> 15:06.071
Okay, fine,
let's say I take your advice.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.824
I pay the IRS. Then what?

15:08.992 --> 15:11.326
Then you don't owe them.

15:11.494 --> 15:14.621
Okay, but I still owe the bank, Skyler.

15:14.789 --> 15:18.625
I'm still going to go bankrupt
and lose my business and my home.

15:18.793 --> 15:21.503
I still have to pull my girls
out of school.

15:21.671 --> 15:26.508
Just because I pay some stupid fine
doesn't make my life any less ruined.

15:28.469 --> 15:33.432
So if I'm understanding you
correctly...

15:33.766 --> 15:37.144
...you're saying you can't take
the money I gave you...

15:38.313 --> 15:40.939
...but you can take a larger amount.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.817
No. I'm just saying...

15:43.985 --> 15:47.154
...as much as I appreciate the gesture...

15:47.322 --> 15:50.365
...the money you gave me
doesn't really change anything.

15:51.492 --> 15:55.495
- Because it's not enough?
- No, no, don't twist my words.

15:55.663 --> 16:00.292
This isn't about amounts,
this is about me doing the right thing.

16:02.170 --> 16:06.757
- Ted, are you blackmailing me?
- What? No. Blackmailing?

16:06.924 --> 16:08.717
God.

16:10.219 --> 16:14.931
- I feel I'm not explaining things right.
- I think you're explaining it fine.

16:19.896 --> 16:26.610
I notice that this is for less
than what I gave you, by the way.

16:26.819 --> 16:30.280
That's the Mercedes. I leased it before
I knew where the money came from.

16:30.448 --> 16:32.824
Now that you know,
you will be returning it.

16:32.992 --> 16:36.244
The leases are ironclad,
so I have to see what's possible...

16:36.412 --> 16:38.914
...but, yeah, I'm gonna do my best.

16:39.082 --> 16:41.667
And I will pay you back
as soon as I can.

16:41.834 --> 16:48.006
I don't want you to pay me, Ted.
I want you to pay them.

16:53.221 --> 16:55.097
Try it again.

16:55.598 --> 16:56.807
Write a new check.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.142
- Skyler.
- Same amount.

16:59.310 --> 17:02.229
- This time, made payable...
- What happened to us?

17:02.397 --> 17:06.400
Make it payable
to the internal Revenue Service.

17:09.112 --> 17:11.905
- I can't.
- You have to.

17:12.073 --> 17:16.576
- Actually, no I don't.
- Write it.

17:35.972 --> 17:38.181
Saul Goodman, please.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.935
Tell him it's important.

17:42.645 --> 17:44.146
Yeah.

17:47.817 --> 17:49.693
What have I done?

18:02.331 --> 18:04.207
Hello, Hector.

18:41.579 --> 18:43.830
All of them, Hector.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.541
Don Eladio.

18:47.168 --> 18:49.169
Don Paco. Cesar.

18:49.337 --> 18:52.088
Renaldo. Artuno.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.341
Cisco and Luis.

18:54.509 --> 18:56.718
Escalada.

18:57.345 --> 19:00.680
All dead.

19:02.016 --> 19:04.726
As is your grandson, Joaquin.

19:10.942 --> 19:12.901
Do you know who killed Joaquin?

19:16.280 --> 19:18.240
Would you like to see?

19:25.873 --> 19:27.123
This young man.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.918
Do you remember him?

19:31.087 --> 19:35.298
That young man
shot Joaquin to death...

19:36.968 --> 19:38.593
...while I made my escape.

19:41.639 --> 19:45.225
I believe you have met him before.

19:51.357 --> 19:54.776
It was just you and Joaquin.

19:55.278 --> 19:58.071
He was the only family you had left.

19:59.574 --> 20:05.287
Now the Salamanca name
dies with you.

20:09.667 --> 20:12.043
Will you look at me now?

20:14.171 --> 20:16.756
Look at me, Hector.

20:20.595 --> 20:22.512
Look at me.

21:26.702 --> 21:28.620
I really appreciate you doing this.

21:28.788 --> 21:32.415
You guys must have your hands filled
with the car wash and all.

21:32.583 --> 21:34.376
No, no. No worries.

21:34.919 --> 21:36.795
Happy to do it.

21:37.421 --> 21:42.425
Besides, it gives me a chance
to see how you work a case.

21:42.593 --> 21:44.886
- It's interesting.
- Yeah.

21:45.054 --> 21:47.263
Like watching weeds grow.

21:48.224 --> 21:50.976
This job can be boring as hell.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.144
Until it's not.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.900
So...

21:59.527 --> 22:03.655
- Any more news on that thing in Mexico?
- No, same old, same old.

22:03.823 --> 22:07.867
Bunch of animals
clawing each other's eyes out over turf.

22:08.577 --> 22:12.288
So you think all the victims
were cartel members?

22:12.456 --> 22:16.292
Not in the loop enough to know.
Take a right on this street, will you?

22:16.460 --> 22:17.585
Right?

22:17.753 --> 22:21.339
But we're going to the chicken farm,
that's straight ahead.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.800
No, we're taking a little detour.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.303
All right.

22:27.471 --> 22:32.308
Yeah, there's this industrial laundry
I wanna check out.

22:32.476 --> 22:35.520
It's not far.
Just, yeah, turn right here.

22:39.358 --> 22:42.861
What...?
What laundry? What about it?

22:43.029 --> 22:46.072
It's owned by this company,
this Madrigal Electromotive.

22:46.240 --> 22:50.118
It's this big German conglomerate
right into everything.

22:50.286 --> 22:55.874
It turns out it's the same company
that owns Fring's chicken joints.

23:00.504 --> 23:04.382
Sounds like a real shot
in the dark there.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.551
I mean, you said it yourself.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.595
If this Madrigal, is it?

23:08.763 --> 23:11.139
If this is such a big conglomerate...

23:11.307 --> 23:15.560
...then, you know, they must own
all kinds of businesses.

23:16.395 --> 23:21.066
No, it just...
it just sounds kind of thin.

23:21.233 --> 23:24.652
Well, look at you. You lose your hair,
go on a couple stakeouts...

23:24.820 --> 23:27.363
...all of a sudden you're, what, Kojak?

23:27.531 --> 23:29.324
I'm just saying.

23:30.785 --> 23:35.246
Now, the chicken farm, however,
boy, that place seems ripe...

23:35.414 --> 23:39.084
...for some kind
of clandestine activities.

23:39.585 --> 23:42.087
I just don't want us to miss anything,
you know?

23:42.254 --> 23:44.672
You wanna talk
about clandestine activities?

23:44.840 --> 23:47.509
Madrigal Electromotive
also owns a subsidiary...

23:47.676 --> 23:51.805
...that manufactures this
state-of-the-art air-filtration system.

23:52.431 --> 23:56.810
And none other than Gale Boetticher
took delivery of one of these systems.

23:56.977 --> 23:59.938
A chemist who was in possession
of hand-drawn plans...

24:00.106 --> 24:05.068
...for a meth super-lab and was visited
by none other than Gus Fring...

24:05.236 --> 24:08.071
...just days before he was capped
in the face, okay?

24:08.239 --> 24:10.448
This shit is starting to feel like...

24:10.616 --> 24:12.951
Like Three Days Of The Condor,
you know?

24:13.119 --> 24:18.706
Anyway, an industrial laundry would be
one hell of a place to hide a meth lab.

24:18.874 --> 24:21.709
There it is right up there.
Just turn in there.

24:25.422 --> 24:27.715
Walt, slow down.
You gotta turn in there, Walt.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.594
- What are you doing? You missed it.
- Sorry.

24:31.762 --> 24:35.682
It looked like a dirt road.
I thought you meant further up.

24:36.684 --> 24:39.144
Just... Just bang a U-ie over here.

24:54.285 --> 24:56.202
Hits the spot. Thanks, guys.

24:56.370 --> 24:59.455
I said to Mom "ice cream,"
but she was like:

24:59.623 --> 25:03.376
"it tastes the same and it's healthier."
So sorry.

25:03.544 --> 25:04.919
I tried.

25:05.087 --> 25:08.882
Frozen yogurt does taste the same.
Tastes exactly the same.

25:09.049 --> 25:11.342
I feel, like, sorry for your taste buds.

25:12.136 --> 25:15.013
- Weigh in here, Uncle Hank.
- Hey, it's free food.

25:15.181 --> 25:18.433
Free food always tastes good.
Free drinks even better.

25:18.601 --> 25:20.101
Hey, hon.

25:20.978 --> 25:23.771
Can you handle another visitor?

25:23.939 --> 25:26.316
Mr. Magoo. Yeah, sure.
Hey, watch out.

25:26.483 --> 25:29.444
- Don't run into any walls or anything.
- Okay.

25:31.614 --> 25:32.864
Hey, Dad.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.782
Hey, son.

25:34.950 --> 25:36.951
So how you feeling, Hank?

25:37.119 --> 25:39.954
It feels like one of those cones
they put on dogs...

25:40.122 --> 25:44.876
- ...so they don't lick their own balls.
- Nice. Thank you. Stay classy.

25:45.461 --> 25:48.713
Anyway, hanging in there.
Glad you stopped by.

25:48.881 --> 25:52.008
Listen, I'm sorry about all this.

25:52.176 --> 25:54.761
I mean,
that guy just came out of nowhere.

25:54.929 --> 25:56.846
Yeah, actually, he didn't.

25:57.014 --> 25:58.848
I saw him coming a mile away.

25:59.600 --> 26:02.185
Hey, just mark it down
as a brain fart...

26:02.353 --> 26:05.605
...and be thankful no one got killed.

26:05.773 --> 26:09.484
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
Your Hardy Boys routine is over.

26:09.652 --> 26:12.070
No more asking him
to drive you on stakeouts.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.697
It's too dangerous. You hear me?

26:14.865 --> 26:16.699
- I'll do it.
- No, you won't.

26:16.867 --> 26:20.245
No, Marie's right.
It was a bit short-sighted of me.

26:20.412 --> 26:23.456
- That's why I caved.
- Caved?

26:23.624 --> 26:27.335
Yeah, I broke down.
I ordered me a gimp-mobile.

26:28.379 --> 26:31.381
I wish you would stop calling it that.

26:31.590 --> 26:34.509
What do you mean?
Like a handi-van with a lift?

26:34.677 --> 26:38.930
No, no, it's a regular Tahoe.
It's got hand controls. I ordered it.

26:39.098 --> 26:43.434
Should be here in about a week.
I don't expect to be in it long...

26:43.602 --> 26:47.855
...but gotta get around on my own. Stop
being such a damn burden to everyone.

26:56.073 --> 26:58.908
Sorry. Car wash business.

26:59.076 --> 27:01.536
Hey, it's me. Can you talk?

27:01.704 --> 27:03.705
- I can listen.
- Fair enough.

27:03.872 --> 27:07.292
He doesn't own a gun,
at least not one that he bought legally.

27:07.459 --> 27:12.088
Nor does his home security system
have any panic-button arrangement.

27:12.256 --> 27:16.509
So way I see it, we're good to go.
If this is still how you want to handle it.

27:18.512 --> 27:20.805
Like I said, I don't want anyone hurt.

27:20.973 --> 27:24.142
All I want
is for him to write a check.

27:24.310 --> 27:28.396
Yeah. It's gonna be fine.
I've got my A-team on it.

27:45.414 --> 27:48.458
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, thanks.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.793
What...? You just can't...

27:53.714 --> 27:56.674
- What's this about?
- I'll tell you what this is about.

27:56.842 --> 28:00.261
This is about you and me
doing our best to keep Huell happy.

28:00.971 --> 28:03.639
- Huell? Who's Huell?
- This is Huell.

28:03.807 --> 28:07.185
- Huell, you happy?
- Reasonably.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.103
What would make you unhappy?

28:09.271 --> 28:11.773
This motherfucker
not doing what he's told.

28:12.274 --> 28:15.276
If you were unhappy,
Mr. Beneke wouldn't care for that?

28:15.736 --> 28:17.945
I'm gonna say no.

28:18.113 --> 28:21.616
Well, there you have it.
Let's go find your checkbook. Ready?

28:21.784 --> 28:25.244
Here we go. All right?
We're walking, we're swinging our feet.

28:25.412 --> 28:28.539
There you go. Very nice.
Beautiful place you have here.

28:28.707 --> 28:35.421
This way. So the amount's
gonna be for $617,226...

28:35.589 --> 28:38.466
- I don't have that kind of money.
- Hold that thought.

28:38.634 --> 28:42.804
Forgot to mention we know exactly how
much money is in your account, okay?

28:42.971 --> 28:46.682
Understand? You still want to say
that stuff from before? Maybe not.

28:46.850 --> 28:53.689
So $617,226 and 31 cents...

28:53.857 --> 28:57.693
...made payable
to the internal Revenue Service.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.113
What?

29:00.739 --> 29:02.782
Wait, this is...?

29:03.075 --> 29:05.827
- Skyler? Skyler white sent you?
- Lt doesn't matter.

29:05.994 --> 29:08.371
For now, all you have to do
is worry about that.

29:08.539 --> 29:10.456
My God, this is a misunderstanding.

29:10.624 --> 29:13.251
Skyler is a dear friend of mine,
all right?

29:13.419 --> 29:16.045
Let me call her. We'll...

29:16.213 --> 29:20.842
No, you're misunderstanding,
Mr. Beneke. Phone-call time is over.

29:21.009 --> 29:24.053
- Check-writing time.
- Skyler would never do this to me.

29:24.221 --> 29:25.763
Sit down and write!

29:27.766 --> 29:29.684
There you go.

29:31.478 --> 29:37.108
Six hundred seventeen thousand,
two hundred twenty-six dollars...

29:37.276 --> 29:38.943
...and thirty-one...

29:39.111 --> 29:41.112
Yeah, right.

29:43.907 --> 29:45.575
You got it.

29:51.999 --> 29:54.041
Huell, you happy?

29:54.918 --> 29:56.836
Huell's happy.

29:57.004 --> 30:01.007
All right. Everything else
has been filled out for you.

30:01.175 --> 30:03.342
All's we need...

30:05.053 --> 30:07.597
...is a signature...

30:07.764 --> 30:09.140
...right there.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.230
Great.

30:16.398 --> 30:17.857
Hard part is over.

30:18.025 --> 30:21.611
Here's what happens next.
Huell is gonna hang here with you.

30:21.778 --> 30:25.323
I'm gonna make sure I get this down
to UPS before 5:00.

30:25.491 --> 30:27.700
Way back,
I'm gonna grab some sandwiches.

30:27.868 --> 30:31.037
The three of us can hang out
and play cards or watch TV...

30:31.205 --> 30:33.748
...for the next couple
of days until the check clears.

30:34.458 --> 30:36.125
Painless, right?

30:36.710 --> 30:39.003
Unless you don't have cable...

30:39.379 --> 30:42.173
...in which case it's gonna suck, so...

31:27.344 --> 31:30.596
Does the laundry have to be dirty?

31:32.975 --> 31:34.642
Nope.

32:18.312 --> 32:20.146
Someone cooked here.

32:21.607 --> 32:24.233
You've been out of commission
four days.

32:24.484 --> 32:28.779
You think we're gonna shut down
the whole operation just for you?

32:28.947 --> 32:31.699
Who cooked? Who was here?

32:40.542 --> 32:43.210
I don't know how you're doing the flips.
Tell me.

32:43.378 --> 32:44.629
Keep cool.

32:45.505 --> 32:48.466
Oh, I'm gonna get you.
Oh, I'm gonna get you.

32:51.553 --> 32:53.179
Jump.

32:56.600 --> 32:59.477
You're pressing buttons,
and it makes you do magical stuff.

32:59.645 --> 33:01.562
- No.
- Yes. Cheater.

33:01.730 --> 33:03.564
- Hey.
- Who's winning?

33:03.732 --> 33:06.609
- I am.
- Well... Yeah. Look at you.

33:06.777 --> 33:09.278
- Look at...
- Yeah.

33:11.657 --> 33:15.326
- A hundred and one back flips, I did.
- Oh, you. Hey, keep it going.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.328
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Relax.

33:17.496 --> 33:19.163
- You're in trouble.
- Good luck.

33:19.331 --> 33:21.540
Mama is in the house.

33:23.543 --> 33:25.336
Jesse.

33:27.005 --> 33:31.175
- What do you want? I'm busy.
- We need to talk.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.470
I got nothing to say to you, man.

33:37.557 --> 33:39.642
Jesse, please. I'm sorry.

33:40.936 --> 33:42.895
Just one minute. That's all I ask.

33:43.063 --> 33:45.064
Get the hell out of my house.

33:45.232 --> 33:46.774
Come on. Come on.

33:46.942 --> 33:49.110
Hey. Just give me one minute.

33:49.277 --> 33:51.987
Let me just explain. Okay.

33:52.155 --> 33:53.531
Let me...

33:53.699 --> 33:57.993
All right. All right.
Okay, okay. All right, I'm sorry.

33:58.578 --> 34:02.081
I know that you have been cooking
without me.

34:02.249 --> 34:05.167
That's right. So what?

34:06.712 --> 34:08.795
So what?

34:08.964 --> 34:12.842
Isn't it obvious to you
what Gus is planning?

34:13.009 --> 34:15.886
He's going to use you to replace me.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.806
He doesn't think
you need me anymore.

34:20.766 --> 34:24.562
Jesse. Jesse, if you agree...

34:24.730 --> 34:26.813
...to replace me...

34:27.440 --> 34:28.774
...he will kill me.

34:29.359 --> 34:34.321
You brought your brother-in-law to our
lab. What the hell is wrong with you?

34:34.489 --> 34:37.616
- That's not my fault, Jesse.
- Get off.

34:38.243 --> 34:41.120
You've got to help me. Please.

34:41.705 --> 34:44.956
The last time I asked for your help,
you said:

34:45.125 --> 34:50.379
"I hope you end up buried in a barrel
in the Mexican desert."

36:29.980 --> 36:32.523
You are done.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.401
Fired.

36:36.486 --> 36:38.863
Do not show your face
at the laundry again.

36:39.489 --> 36:41.991
Stay away from Pinkman.

36:42.492 --> 36:45.286
Do not go near him.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.413
Ever.

36:48.206 --> 36:50.416
Are you listening to me?

36:55.046 --> 36:57.464
Or else you'll do what?

36:58.717 --> 37:00.426
What did you say?

37:00.594 --> 37:03.262
Stay away from Pinkman...

37:05.765 --> 37:08.142
...or else you'll do...

37:09.394 --> 37:11.020
...what?

37:11.605 --> 37:13.355
Kill me?

37:15.859 --> 37:18.485
If you could kill me...

37:21.031 --> 37:23.532
...I'd already be dead.

37:26.369 --> 37:28.662
But you can't.

37:28.830 --> 37:31.790
You can't kill me...

37:32.918 --> 37:37.630
...because Jesse wouldn't cook for you
if you did.

37:40.383 --> 37:42.551
That's it, isn't it?

37:48.642 --> 37:51.477
No matter how hard you try...

37:51.645 --> 37:53.812
...to turn him against me...

37:53.980 --> 37:56.315
...to screw with his head...

37:56.483 --> 37:59.485
...so that he would hate my guts...

38:00.403 --> 38:05.449
...and he still won't let you do it.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.119
For now.

38:09.871 --> 38:11.288
But he'll come around.

38:13.041 --> 38:16.251
In the meantime, there's the matter
of your brother-in-law.

38:17.045 --> 38:21.507
He is a problem you promised
to resolve.

38:21.675 --> 38:23.509
You have failed.

38:23.677 --> 38:28.055
Now it's left to me to deal with him.

38:28.223 --> 38:29.890
You can't...

38:30.058 --> 38:32.810
if you try to interfere...

38:34.854 --> 38:37.523
...this becomes
a much simpler matter.

38:38.692 --> 38:41.110
I will kill your wife.

38:41.277 --> 38:43.529
I will kill your son.

38:44.781 --> 38:48.158
I will kill your infant daughter.

39:37.751 --> 39:41.670
Great. Perfect. You know, this is just...

39:43.256 --> 39:46.133
I told her you were my A-team.

39:46.593 --> 39:48.218
It was an act of God.

39:48.386 --> 39:51.805
Ain't no accounting
for no act of God.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.891
Check is in the mail, at least.

39:54.434 --> 39:55.726
"Hello, Mrs. White.

39:55.894 --> 39:59.730
The good news is the IRS
has been paid off. The bad news is..."

40:00.065 --> 40:01.899
Jesus!

40:02.692 --> 40:04.109
Well, here goes nothing.

40:04.277 --> 40:06.695
- Hey! Hey!
- Slow down.

40:06.863 --> 40:08.280
- What the...?
- Saul.

40:08.448 --> 40:11.700
- How did you hear?
- What? Hear what?

40:12.744 --> 40:15.579
Guys, go, go, go. Scram.

40:15.747 --> 40:18.290
- What the hell happened to you?
- Saul. Saul.

40:18.458 --> 40:20.292
This man that we spoke of before.

40:20.460 --> 40:23.378
This person that you said
could disappear me.

40:23.546 --> 40:25.005
- Give me a new life.
- Yeah.

40:25.173 --> 40:27.174
- Make sure I'm never found.
- Yeah.

40:27.342 --> 40:30.385
Yeah, I need him, Saul.

40:30.553 --> 40:32.679
Gus is gonna murder
my whole family.

40:33.306 --> 40:34.640
Christ.

40:34.808 --> 40:37.476
I need this man now.

40:37.644 --> 40:39.978
- Saul. Now, Saul!
- Yeah, yeah.

40:40.146 --> 40:43.982
There's no coming back. You're gonna
get new Socials, new identities.

40:44.150 --> 40:47.152
You can't contact your friends
or relatives ever again.

40:47.320 --> 40:50.405
- All right. I understand.
- How are you gonna sell this...

40:50.573 --> 40:54.159
- ...to that wife of yours and your son?
- I have got no choice.

40:54.327 --> 40:57.412
You're wanted by scary individuals,
not to mention the law.

40:57.580 --> 41:01.125
You're high-risk. You'll need
the deluxe service. It'll cost you.

41:01.292 --> 41:02.543
How much?

41:02.710 --> 41:06.296
Last quote I got on the deluxe
was 125 grand.

41:06.506 --> 41:09.007
But you got four people.
It'll be at least half a million.

41:09.175 --> 41:11.593
- He accepts cash only.
- I've got the money.

41:11.761 --> 41:13.095
- Please!
- Here.

41:13.263 --> 41:14.680
Okay.

41:15.557 --> 41:18.225
This is a vacuum cleaner
repair company.

41:18.393 --> 41:21.895
Did you expect Haji's Quick-Vanish?
I don't even know his name.

41:22.063 --> 41:24.022
You just call and leave a message.

41:24.190 --> 41:27.359
You tell them
that you need a new dust filter...

41:27.527 --> 41:30.529
...for a Hoover MaxExtract
Pressure Pro, Model 60.

41:30.697 --> 41:33.240
I wrote it right on there.
He'll call you back.

41:33.408 --> 41:36.368
Okay, fine. How long does it take
for him to arrange?

41:36.536 --> 41:38.537
The guy works fast. That's the game.

41:38.705 --> 41:42.499
You gotta have your family packed
and ready before you make the call.

41:42.667 --> 41:46.086
He'll tell you where to meet,
he'll put you up in a safe house.

41:46.254 --> 41:49.798
You gotta bring money. He doesn't
lift a finger unless he's paid.

41:49.966 --> 41:51.341
Okay.

41:51.926 --> 41:54.094
- Saul.
- Can't say it's been a pleasure...

41:54.262 --> 41:56.597
I need you to do one more thing
for me.

41:56.764 --> 41:58.348
You need to call the DEA.

41:58.516 --> 42:01.101
You need to tell them Gus
has a hit out on Hank.

42:01.269 --> 42:04.188
- You have to do it for me.
- I gotta go on living here.

42:04.355 --> 42:07.691
- I'm way too comfortable in my...
- Just call anonymously.

42:07.859 --> 42:09.818
- You call anonymously!
- I can't!

42:09.986 --> 42:11.862
I'm practically in the DEA family.

42:12.030 --> 42:15.616
I go to their Christmas parties.
They know me. They know my voice.

42:15.783 --> 42:18.368
They'll know me.
Please, you gotta do it for me.

42:18.536 --> 42:20.871
- Please. Please.
- No.

42:21.039 --> 42:24.499
My brother-in-law doesn't deserve
to die because of this.

42:24.667 --> 42:27.044
There's no way I'm mentioning Gus.

42:27.212 --> 42:30.005
- Okay.
- The most I'll go...

42:30.215 --> 42:32.716
I'll say it's the cartel.
They're back to finish the job.

42:32.884 --> 42:37.095
You say whatever you have to say.
You just give me an hour to...

42:37.889 --> 42:40.557
I need to collect my wife and kids.
Okay?

42:40.725 --> 42:45.354
Give me an hour and then you make
the phone call. Don't forget. Please.

42:45.521 --> 42:47.272
Yeah.

42:48.483 --> 42:50.317
Thank you, Saul.

43:24.727 --> 43:26.311
No, no, no.

43:27.605 --> 43:29.022
Where's the rest?

43:30.316 --> 43:33.485
That's not enough.
That's not enough.

43:35.738 --> 43:38.490
- Walt?
- Down here!

43:41.369 --> 43:45.163
Walt, what did that phone call mean?

43:45.873 --> 43:47.541
Where is it?

43:48.543 --> 43:50.419
Where's the rest?

43:51.254 --> 43:53.797
The money, Skyler.
Where is the rest?

43:55.383 --> 43:57.676
Skyler, where is the money?

44:04.517 --> 44:06.935
I gave it to Ted.

44:07.103 --> 44:08.562
What?

44:08.980 --> 44:13.150
- You did what?
- Walt, I had to.

44:13.318 --> 44:14.943
For us, for the family.

44:15.111 --> 44:16.778
I swear, Walt...

44:16.946 --> 44:19.323
You gave our money to Beneke?

44:19.490 --> 44:24.786
Walt, please.
Please just hear me out. Please.

44:33.296 --> 44:33.796
Walt.

44:58.196 --> 45:02.240
Hi, you've reached the White family.
Please leave a message.

45:02.408 --> 45:04.368
Skyler.

45:05.578 --> 45:07.037
It's happening again.

45:07.205 --> 45:11.708
The DEA called, they got some tip
from an informant.

45:12.168 --> 45:14.378
The cartel, they want to kill Hank.

45:15.463 --> 45:17.422
Oh, God.

45:18.466 --> 45:24.179
They're sending agents
to our house right now to guard us.

45:24.347 --> 45:26.264
Oh, God.

45:26.432 --> 45:29.393
When is this going to end?

45:32.105 --> 45:34.189
Marie, I'm here.

45:34.357 --> 45:35.982
I'm here.

45:36.150 --> 45:38.985
Tell me exactly what happened.
