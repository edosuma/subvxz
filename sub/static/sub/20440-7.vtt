WEBVTT

00:06.040 --> 00:07.308
Vegas, L.A.

00:07.375 --> 00:09.277
I have such a warped idea
of Christmas weather.

00:09.343 --> 00:11.412
Maybe for Christmas
vacation

00:11.479 --> 00:15.049
we can go to Vail
or somewhere with snow.

00:16.817 --> 00:18.752
The Gentrys
are going to Vail.

00:18.819 --> 00:21.122
Or Aspen,
one or the other.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.095
Are you listening?

00:28.062 --> 00:29.897
I could get you
a snow globe.

00:29.963 --> 00:31.632
Nice save.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.569
What's going on
with you, Dad?

00:35.636 --> 00:37.271
Are you worried
about the IA thing?

00:38.206 --> 00:40.274
It's a pain and a time sink.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.476
I just have to work
around it.

00:42.543 --> 00:45.479
By submitting to this coerced
involuntary interview,

00:45.546 --> 00:47.481
I am in no way waiving rights

00:47.548 --> 00:50.684
afforded me by the Peace
Officer's Bill of Rights Act.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.753
Familiar
with the Lybarger.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.255
That a question?

00:54.322 --> 00:56.424
I have your complaint
history here.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.092
I know
how you feel about IA.

00:58.159 --> 01:00.261
I don't see how you could.

01:00.328 --> 01:01.929
That we're out for scalps.

01:01.995 --> 01:03.464
That's not me.

01:03.531 --> 01:04.765
Right.

01:06.367 --> 01:08.136
Let's get started, shall we?

01:08.202 --> 01:10.271
Have you seen
the cell phone video?

01:10.338 --> 01:11.839
- Yes.
- Does it clearly depict

01:11.905 --> 01:13.941
your interaction with
District Attorney O'Shea?

01:14.007 --> 01:15.143
Yes.

01:16.444 --> 01:19.880
Do these photographs
accurately illustrate

01:19.947 --> 01:22.150
specific moments
from that encounter?

01:22.216 --> 01:26.154
Conduct unbecoming,
clearly.

01:26.220 --> 01:28.656
Add to that the obligation
of LAPD officers

01:28.722 --> 01:31.625
to provide "close cooperation
with prosecutors"

01:31.692 --> 01:34.728
as stated in the manual,
and we have a problem.

01:34.795 --> 01:35.763
Agreed?

01:36.964 --> 01:38.666
May I ask you a question?

01:39.900 --> 01:41.235
Well, if it's relevant.

01:41.302 --> 01:42.936
You ever worked a case
for two years,

01:43.003 --> 01:44.205
then had the DA kick it

01:44.272 --> 01:45.539
'cause it wasn't
a slam-dunk,

01:45.606 --> 01:47.175
because he was more concerned

01:47.241 --> 01:50.144
with his win-loss record
than obtaining justice?

01:50.211 --> 01:52.280
Because that's what this
encounter was about.

01:52.346 --> 01:54.715
That's your rationale?
Duly noted.

01:54.782 --> 01:58.051
I lost my temper, Sergeant.
There's no contesting it.

01:58.118 --> 02:01.522
But I know O'Shea
didn't file this 128.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.091
He didn't have to.

02:04.158 --> 02:05.693
Did he sign on to it?

02:05.759 --> 02:07.027
No. He declined.

02:07.094 --> 02:08.529
He was the injured party.

02:10.063 --> 02:11.932
Public perception
of the department

02:11.999 --> 02:13.334
is also
the injured party.

02:13.401 --> 02:14.735
I'll be writing a SKELLY

02:14.802 --> 02:17.205
and requesting
the chief support mediation.

02:17.271 --> 02:19.207
Like the last time.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.874
And the next.

02:22.910 --> 02:25.213
You're predictable,
detective.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.453
**

02:51.205 --> 02:53.941
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

02:54.007 --> 02:56.377
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

02:56.444 --> 02:59.413
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

02:59.480 --> 03:01.615
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

03:01.682 --> 03:04.685
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

03:04.752 --> 03:06.920
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

03:06.987 --> 03:10.291
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

03:10.358 --> 03:11.592
* I can't let go *

03:24.171 --> 03:26.340
* I feel *

03:33.747 --> 03:35.182
Well, congrats.

03:35.249 --> 03:37.285
You made it through
without killing her.

03:37.351 --> 03:39.453
And you were brilliant
in there defending me.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.689
I thought I handled it
pretty well.

03:45.359 --> 03:46.527
How'd it go?

03:47.428 --> 03:48.896
I heard that.

03:50.698 --> 03:51.799
Shit.

03:53.801 --> 03:56.770
Fingerprints put Jesse Tafero
in Gunn's apartment.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.973
Maybe he plays dumb,
denies knowing him.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.342
Eh, we got him
where we want him.

04:01.409 --> 04:02.943
The bartender ID's
Jesse Tafero

04:03.010 --> 04:04.278
as the guy drinking with Gunn

04:04.345 --> 04:05.446
the week before his murder.

04:05.513 --> 04:06.847
Jesse wanted
to be a cop too,

04:06.914 --> 04:08.015
like
his big brother.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.116
What happened?

04:09.182 --> 04:10.451
Tanked the exam.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.019
Didn't make it
into the Academy.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.854
Mm-hmm.
Chip on his shoulder?

04:13.921 --> 04:16.757
Maybe he wants to prove
he's smarter than us.

04:16.824 --> 04:18.459
No doubt.

04:18.526 --> 04:21.329
I'd like to get him in here
as a wit, not a suspect.

04:21.395 --> 04:23.464
He works security
at an apartment complex

04:23.531 --> 04:25.165
on Hollywood near Argyle.

04:25.232 --> 04:26.834
- Guard?
- Supervisor.

04:26.900 --> 04:27.968
Well, that's good.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.437
He won't want to talk
in front of his guys.

04:29.503 --> 04:30.904
Try to get him here.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.840
Make him think it's
his idea, if you can.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.642
That's the right play.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.844
And if his watch looks like
it matches those marks?

04:36.910 --> 04:38.346
We'll swab it for DNA.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.947
- How are you gonna get it?
- We'll ask him.

04:40.013 --> 04:41.014
And if he won't go along?

04:41.081 --> 04:42.783
arrest his ass.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.118
Okay. Step at a time.

04:45.185 --> 04:47.087
Pierce, do a warrant
for the swab.

04:47.154 --> 04:48.522
Mm-hmm.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.763
You know, Rudy came up
when we did.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.666
Maybe he taught Jesse
how to do it.

04:58.732 --> 05:01.034
You can learn
the chokehold anywhere,

05:01.101 --> 05:02.703
off the internet.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.137
Maybe.

05:04.204 --> 05:06.440
You think Rudy
was there, too?

05:06.507 --> 05:07.708
That he did Gunn?

05:07.775 --> 05:09.309
Well, it's not a stretch.

05:09.377 --> 05:11.044
Jesse's brother,
Holland's muscle.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.781
Well, we got nothing on Rudy
that puts him there.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.684
You got something?

05:16.750 --> 05:18.886
Something
you're holding back?

05:21.789 --> 05:23.457
Just a thought.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.967
DNA on that roach you picked up
near your house came back.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.703
Woody Woodrow.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.638
That's who I was chasing.

05:37.705 --> 05:40.073
Car still hasn't
turned up.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.742
We need to talk to him.

05:41.809 --> 05:44.311
Use this to get a warrant
on his place--

05:44.378 --> 05:46.580
- confirmation swab.
- Already on it.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.281
You think Billets
will spring for overtime?

05:48.348 --> 05:50.851
DNA should buy us a couple
of extra days of surveillance.

05:50.918 --> 05:54.221
You really are an optimist
under all that dark shit.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.856
That's me--
Mr. Glass-Half-Full.

05:55.923 --> 05:58.859
Come on. We'll hit up Billets
on our way to the beach.

06:01.395 --> 06:02.763
Captain Lewis.

06:02.830 --> 06:05.032
Thank you
for seeing me, sir.

06:09.136 --> 06:12.372
I just wanted
to give you a heads up.

06:12.440 --> 06:15.409
Bosch met with IA
this morning.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.044
I'm aware of that.

06:17.110 --> 06:20.581
Bullpen chatter says
it didn't go well at all.

06:20.648 --> 06:24.452
I'm shocked, shocked
that it didn't go well.

06:24.518 --> 06:26.286
No surprise.

06:26.353 --> 06:27.821
And I also
wanted you to know

06:27.888 --> 06:30.924
I have spoken
with Lieutenant Billets.

06:30.991 --> 06:35.429
She's capable but been
at Hollywood a long time.

06:36.430 --> 06:37.665
Her guys adore her,

06:37.731 --> 06:39.633
but that's not always
a positive.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.368
I've been trying
to tighten things up

06:41.435 --> 06:42.836
since I came on board.

06:44.137 --> 06:46.740
You and Billets have
a personal connection, right?

06:46.807 --> 06:48.041
Family?

06:48.108 --> 06:49.443
Married to her ex.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.579
Sounds complicated.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.447
The lieutenant and I
do our best

06:53.514 --> 06:54.782
to keep our personal
lives separate.

06:54.848 --> 06:57.050
I'm sure you do.
Still...

06:58.251 --> 07:00.253
may not
be the best situation

07:00.320 --> 07:01.655
in the long run.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.657
Sir, I hope you don't
think I came here

07:03.724 --> 07:05.793
to undermine Grace
in any way.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.294
I think the world of her.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.130
Oh. Goes without saying.

07:11.499 --> 07:12.733
Well, thank you, Captain.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.502
Let's wait and see
what IA says about Bosch

07:14.568 --> 07:15.969
and then take it from there.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.104
Yes, sir.

07:36.824 --> 07:39.359
We agreed to work as partners
till this one's done.

07:39.426 --> 07:41.161
That's what we're doing.

07:43.531 --> 07:46.199
You should've
come to me, Jerry.

07:46.266 --> 07:47.935
You ever gonna
get over that?

07:48.001 --> 07:49.469
Working on it.

07:51.438 --> 07:54.675
But yeah.
I'm your partner.

07:54.742 --> 07:56.777
And you can count on me.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.311
So you do count on me.

07:58.378 --> 07:59.813
Working on it.

08:06.987 --> 08:07.955
Hey.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.460
Robertson and Pierce,
Hollywood Division.

08:13.527 --> 08:14.662
Jesse Tafero?

08:14.728 --> 08:16.564
Guilty as charged.
How can I help you?

08:16.630 --> 08:19.032
We're hoping you might be
able to do exactly that--

08:19.099 --> 08:20.367
help us out with a case.

08:20.433 --> 08:21.802
Oh, sure, yeah, if I can.

08:21.869 --> 08:24.337
If you could give us,
say, ten, 15 minutes.

08:24.404 --> 08:25.939
Now's not a great time.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.741
Could you come back
later today?

08:27.808 --> 08:29.376
What do you think?

08:29.442 --> 08:31.444
Uh, might be
cutting it close.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.247
Mm. Maybe meet you
on my break.

08:34.314 --> 08:36.784
You sure you can't
just do this now,
get it out of the way?

08:36.850 --> 08:38.619
The thing is, you know,
time is of the essence.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.087
Yeah. Okay.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.655
You can come to the station
for a minute.

08:41.722 --> 08:42.823
That'd work, right?

08:42.890 --> 08:44.457
That would be better
in a lot of ways.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.859
- Yeah.
- Private.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.094
- We're over on Wilcox
- I know where you are.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.029
Take DeLongpre,
we're there in five.

08:49.096 --> 08:52.165
Uh, on second thought,
why don't we talk here?

08:53.266 --> 08:54.635
Well,

08:54.702 --> 08:56.670
there's a guy
we'd like to show you.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.739
- A suspect?
- Maybe. Or a witness.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.007
Okay. What's the case?

09:00.073 --> 09:02.142
- 187. It's called--
- A homicide.

09:03.844 --> 09:04.845
You know the code.

09:04.912 --> 09:07.681
Yeah, I do,
as a matter of fact.

09:07.748 --> 09:10.818
Uh, I can take my car.

09:10.884 --> 09:11.819
Save you a trip back.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.320
- Perfect.
- Great.

09:49.657 --> 09:51.491
You want us to pick him up
if he shows?

09:51.558 --> 09:53.360
Nah, just call me.
But if he comes home

09:53.426 --> 09:56.263
and decides to go back out
again, do not lose him.

09:56.329 --> 09:57.497
Yeah, no worries.

09:57.564 --> 09:59.532
We got this.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.168
- Back to the house?
- Yeah.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.837
I want to see how Robertson's
doing with Jesse Tafero.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.249
Ballsy, letting him
drive himself.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.384
What if he takes off?

10:17.450 --> 10:19.352
Sometimes you make
an informed decision,

10:19.419 --> 10:20.788
hope that it pans out.

10:20.854 --> 10:23.691
Is that Santiago-speak
for "roll the dice"?

10:23.757 --> 10:25.025
If he rabbits now,

10:25.092 --> 10:26.860
we have cause to give
him serious grief.

10:26.927 --> 10:29.029
You and Bosch are different,
but in some ways--

10:29.096 --> 10:31.198
Hey, you know, you don't want
to finish that sentence.

10:32.499 --> 10:34.735
If your name is Santiago,
why do they call you Jimmy?

10:34.802 --> 10:37.104
Santiago
is Spanish for James.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.338
Heh. No kidding.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.307
Hey, hey, hey!

10:40.373 --> 10:41.775
- Keep on moving!
- Watch the road!

10:41.842 --> 10:45.145
Keep fucking moving!
Let's go! Move! Go!

10:48.648 --> 10:50.684
Shit. Damn it.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.420
6W51. Do we have an
airship over Hollywood?

10:53.486 --> 10:56.223
Any airship over
Hollywood, come in.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.225
W51 requesting.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.160
Air 8 at Western
and Santa Monica.

11:00.227 --> 11:04.965
W51. Request Air 8 go to
an available tac frequency.

11:05.032 --> 11:09.436
Air 8, W51, switch
to Tac 2 channel 41.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.004
There he is.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.808
Air 8 here. Whatcha got?

11:15.675 --> 11:17.210
Disregard Air 8.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.246
False alarm. Sorry.

11:19.312 --> 11:20.613
Back off.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.949
You sure?

11:22.015 --> 11:24.051
Everybody has favorite
shortcuts.

11:24.117 --> 11:26.186
He just wanted
to take Fountain.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.428
Tell me, Ms. Benitez,

11:35.495 --> 11:37.030
why shouldn't I
admit testimony

11:37.097 --> 11:38.698
from Detective Bosch's
civil trial?

11:38.766 --> 11:39.833
It's irrelevant.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.701
Defense's intent
here is obvious

11:41.769 --> 11:43.303
and exclusively
prejudicial.

11:43.370 --> 11:46.573
It establishes a disturbing
and career-long pattern

11:46.639 --> 11:48.208
of rogue behavior
by Detective Bosch.

11:48.275 --> 11:51.244
It does nothing of the kind.
Rumors and allegations.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.246
And there's nothing there
in that transcript

11:53.313 --> 11:55.315
that impeaches Bosch's long
record of veracity under oath.

11:55.382 --> 11:58.251
- Your Honor--
- Mr. Fowkkes, you've
made your point.

11:58.318 --> 12:01.388
Ms. Benitez, I denied
Mr. Fowwkes' motion

12:01.454 --> 12:02.722
to suppress
Bosch's account

12:02.790 --> 12:04.224
of his conversation
with Mr. Holland

12:04.291 --> 12:06.193
and his putative
confession, did I not?

12:06.259 --> 12:07.861
Yes, Your Honor,
and correctly so.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.262
What I did not do

12:09.329 --> 12:11.598
is immunize Detective Bosch
from cross-examination.

12:11.664 --> 12:13.233
And if you're unhappy
with my decision,

12:13.300 --> 12:15.803
you can always revisit a plea
agreement with Mr. Fowkkes

12:15.869 --> 12:16.937
before the jury is seated.

12:17.004 --> 12:18.305
Motion denied.

12:18.371 --> 12:19.239
Your Honor, if I may--

12:19.306 --> 12:21.441
Is this a new motion,
Ms. Benitez?

12:21.508 --> 12:22.709
No, Your Honor.

12:22.776 --> 12:24.411
What about you,
Mr. Fowwkes?

12:24.477 --> 12:26.446
Well, we're ready to proceed
to trial, Your Honor.

12:26.513 --> 12:29.449
Then we'll schedule voir dire
to commence next week.

12:38.525 --> 12:39.960
Did you forget about me?

12:42.029 --> 12:44.898
Nobody stopped in
to offer you coffee, water?

12:44.965 --> 12:46.800
Typical.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.601
Very sorry.
What can we get you?

12:48.668 --> 12:51.338
You can get this moving.
I need to get back to work.

12:51.404 --> 12:52.539
Yeah, yeah, sure.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.343
This is about Eddie Gunn,
isn't it?

12:56.409 --> 12:57.710
Why do you say that?

12:57.777 --> 12:59.612
I heard he was murdered.

12:59.679 --> 13:01.414
You knew him?

13:01.481 --> 13:04.517
Yeah. We weren't best buds,
but we'd have a beer.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.854
Couple times, when he
would've pulled a deuce,

13:06.920 --> 13:08.021
I drove him home.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.689
Just dropped him off?

13:09.756 --> 13:12.292
Usually. He could
get pretty hammered.

13:12.359 --> 13:16.496
You had to help him up
the stairs, tuck him in?

13:16.563 --> 13:18.031
What of it?

13:21.869 --> 13:23.370
Oh.

13:23.436 --> 13:24.905
I get it.

13:24.972 --> 13:26.840
You pulled a print
or something.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.608
You don't want my help.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.844
This is bullshit.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.145
You're looking at me.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.747
You think I did Eddie.

13:34.814 --> 13:35.782
Fuck you.

13:35.849 --> 13:37.851
Calm down.

13:37.918 --> 13:39.386
If we had pulled
your prints,you think

13:39.452 --> 13:41.654
we would've let you drive
over here on your own?

13:41.721 --> 13:43.190
But now we know.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.993
Now we have to cover you
in case a print does pop up.

13:47.861 --> 13:50.931
So where were you
the night he dropped?

13:50.998 --> 13:53.300
When was it?

13:53.366 --> 13:54.902
Sunday night, 13th.

13:54.968 --> 13:58.405
Okay.
Uh, two Sundays ago?

13:58.471 --> 13:59.539
Well?

13:59.606 --> 14:00.807
Uh...

14:00.874 --> 14:02.842
with my brother,
his place,

14:02.910 --> 14:04.244
watching the World Cup.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.714
When to when?

14:07.780 --> 14:10.350
Started around 11:30.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.619
Watched from the semis
through the final.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.121
About four hours straight.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.722
Isn't the World Cup
usually played mid-summer,

14:15.788 --> 14:17.724
- every four years?
- Rerun.

14:17.790 --> 14:20.327
Italy-France 2006.

14:22.029 --> 14:24.197
When Zidane head-butted
Materrazi and got a red.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.332
Yeah.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.466
Are you a fan?

14:26.533 --> 14:27.968
Oh, the beautiful game.

14:28.035 --> 14:30.137
Zidane--
great player.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.538
Dumb fuck.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.173
France couldn't
score without him.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.108
I remember that game.
1-1 at the end

14:35.175 --> 14:36.309
- of extra time.
- Yeah.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.744
Italy took it
on penalty kicks.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.480
Excuse me.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.584
Robertson.

14:44.651 --> 14:45.919
I need to see you.

14:45.986 --> 14:47.487
- Right now?
- Yes.

14:47.554 --> 14:48.755
Ohh.

14:48.821 --> 14:50.157
Bureaucracy.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.558
Just give me a minute.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.726
A minute.
I gotta get back.

14:53.793 --> 14:55.228
Maybe less, okay?

15:02.869 --> 15:05.738
- What the fuck?
- You're going kind
of fast, aren't you?

15:05.805 --> 15:08.008
Well, the guy's been
prepped like alibis
are an Olympic event.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.210
I want it all down.
Then I can take it apart.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.579
They want the prepped
version on record.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.081
Once that's done, he's done.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.882
He's not gonna give you
anything else after that.

15:15.949 --> 15:18.185
Which tells me
I got the right guy.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.919
Agreed.
But if you arrest him,

15:19.987 --> 15:21.955
that tips
anybody else involved.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.423
So if it isn't his watch--

15:23.490 --> 15:24.457
Is this a hunch?

15:24.524 --> 15:26.159
Or do you actually
have something?

15:26.226 --> 15:27.627
We're talking timing here.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.096
Don't interrupt me again.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.503
Hey, so where were we?

15:36.569 --> 15:39.872
Oh, yeah, you were kicking
back, watching a game.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.242
Did you order take-out?

15:42.309 --> 15:44.844
No, it was just, uh,
beer, leftovers, chips.

15:44.911 --> 15:46.246
What kind of beer?

15:46.313 --> 15:48.615
All kinds.
I don't know.

15:48.681 --> 15:51.118
I mean, what do I know?
Man, give me a Bud.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.521
And you went home when?

15:54.587 --> 15:57.557
Uh, about 9.

15:58.925 --> 16:01.028
You said the Cup didn't
start until 11:30.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.096
Yeah, 9 the next morning.

16:03.163 --> 16:05.032
I crashed on the couch.

16:05.098 --> 16:06.766
Too much Guinness.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.168
Yeah. I been there.

16:08.235 --> 16:11.771
Yeah. So now we know
where I was.

16:11.838 --> 16:13.940
Are we working
a case or what?

16:14.007 --> 16:16.376
Oh, yeah,
let's get to it.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.611
Uh, take a look.

16:19.846 --> 16:22.915
Yeah. Bartender.
Smog Cutter.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.052
And the last time
you were in there?

16:25.118 --> 16:29.356
A...couple weeks ago,
maybe.

16:29.422 --> 16:30.757
With Gunn?

16:30.823 --> 16:33.060
You fucker.

16:34.361 --> 16:37.297
I'm trying to help you,
and this is how you do?

16:38.231 --> 16:40.533
Fuck you.
I'm out of here.

16:41.601 --> 16:42.735
You can't hold me here.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.037
I came in on my own steam.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.405
- I leave the same way.
- Not now.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.207
- You're under arrest.
- Shit.

16:47.274 --> 16:49.376
- Under arrest for what?
- I'll think of something.

16:49.442 --> 16:50.810
For what?

16:50.877 --> 16:53.113
How about
resisting arrest?

16:54.013 --> 16:55.682
I want my phone call.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.217
Soon as you're booked.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.653
I'll need your
personal property.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.356
Wallet, cell phone,
watch.

17:23.210 --> 17:26.479
So do you know
why you are here?

17:26.546 --> 17:30.016
Yeah. Lying sack
of shit right there.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.784
You're being booked

17:31.851 --> 17:33.620
for the murder
of Edward Gunn.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.788
That's funny. I heard one
of you guys did that.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.824
- Are you sick,
ill, or injured?
- Not yet.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.360
Do you fear for your safety
while at this facility?

17:40.427 --> 17:43.630
Not as long
as we go one-on-one,
you motherfuckers.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.834
Little charmer is all yours.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.502
My call.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.906
You've reached Cindy Wagner.

17:53.973 --> 17:55.041
Leave a message.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.944
Ms. Wagner,
this is Detective Bosch,

17:58.010 --> 17:59.446
Los Angeles Police Department.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.648
If you could call me back
at your earliest convenience.

18:01.714 --> 18:02.682
Thank you.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.585
Harry, we've got him.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.554
Dead to rights.

18:10.690 --> 18:11.758
Check it out.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.093
This is a couple blocks

18:14.161 --> 18:15.928
from where Sharkey
was last seen.

18:15.995 --> 18:17.797
There. The BMW.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.666
No plate,
no Moreno.

18:19.732 --> 18:22.235
- Have a little faith.
- It's a work in progress.

18:22.302 --> 18:26.206
Same car. Highland.
Headed towards the Bowl.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.275
Definitely two people
in the car.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.009
Check the time code.

18:30.076 --> 18:32.011
Still no plate,
still no Moreno.

18:32.078 --> 18:34.414
Patience, grasshopper.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.451
Ah.

18:38.518 --> 18:39.352
Moreno?

18:39.419 --> 18:40.953
Ten minutes later,

18:41.020 --> 18:43.290
headed back, Franklin.

18:46.559 --> 18:47.894
Xavi Moreno.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.596
All by himself.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.931
There he is.
You run the plates?

18:51.998 --> 18:54.066
Yes ma'am.
Stolen.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.368
Good job.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.404
So we pick up Moreno?

18:57.470 --> 18:58.571
No.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.640
What's the problem?
I mean, we got him.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.642
He'll crack like
a plumber's butt.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.477
We want to question
Woodrow first

19:04.544 --> 19:06.246
before he knows
what we know about Moreno.

19:06.313 --> 19:08.648
But good job, scouts.

19:08.715 --> 19:11.184
This is really excellent
work, gentlemen.

19:11.251 --> 19:13.753
Worth a warrant
when we need it.

19:13.820 --> 19:14.921
Hmm.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.692
No damage.
I just told the truth.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.761
Hang tight.
I'm pulling up now.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.464
I'll see you in a few.
You get all that?

19:27.934 --> 19:29.068
Pierce.

19:29.135 --> 19:30.303
Thanks.

19:31.438 --> 19:32.872
Hey, Pierce, you get
those swabs back

19:32.939 --> 19:34.040
on that watch yet?

19:34.106 --> 19:35.242
I put a rush on it.

19:35.308 --> 19:36.643
So some time
next month.

19:36.709 --> 19:37.810
If we're lucky.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.312
Rudy Tafero's
about to show up.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.947
Right on cue.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.251
Robertson.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.220
One sec.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.689
Mank. He's got Rudy
in the break room.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.691
So let's go see what
the acting coach has to say.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.226
We'll be right there.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.927
Jimmy, you gonna
hold him or kick him?

19:56.095 --> 19:57.797
Uh, kick him with a tail.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.832
See who he runs to.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.568
Let him make a mistake.

20:09.175 --> 20:11.311
- Bosch.
- Rudy.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.846
I didn't come here
looking for trouble.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.748
It just follows you?

20:15.815 --> 20:16.849
Where's my brother?

20:16.916 --> 20:17.950
It's not my case.

20:18.017 --> 20:18.951
It's his.

20:20.152 --> 20:21.888
How can we help you,
Mr. Tafero?

20:21.954 --> 20:24.391
Cutting the bullshit
would be a good start.

20:24.457 --> 20:27.427
Come on, charge him
or kick him.

20:27.494 --> 20:29.195
We have 48 hours.

20:29.262 --> 20:30.330
You got nothing.

20:30.397 --> 20:32.465
And that's not gonna change.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.934
This isn't even about Jesse,
is it, Bosch?

20:35.001 --> 20:38.571
Just gives you a warm
feeling to fuck with me.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.541
Give him a break?

20:41.608 --> 20:43.510
What do you say, Bosch?

20:43.576 --> 20:44.977
You're the officer
in charge,

20:45.044 --> 20:46.813
but I don't think we've
got enough air freshener

20:46.879 --> 20:48.548
to cover both of them.

20:52.952 --> 20:56.323
Okay. We'll kick him.

20:57.324 --> 20:59.526
Say thank you
to Detective Bosch.

21:07.334 --> 21:09.702
Another dissatisfied
customer.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.104
Is there any
other kind?

21:16.843 --> 21:18.945
- Whatcha got?
- Nothing much.

21:19.011 --> 21:20.413
No sign of Woodrow.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.416
But a question
from Dexter and Gordon.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.452
Do we need a third team
for overnight or--

21:25.518 --> 21:26.986
So they can pick up
the overtime?

21:27.053 --> 21:27.954
Sure. Let him have it.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.389
Anything going on there?

21:29.456 --> 21:31.157
Found Dobbs' ex in Boca.

21:31.223 --> 21:32.291
Waiting for her

21:32.359 --> 21:33.460
to call me back.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.127
Rudy just sprung his brother.

21:35.194 --> 21:37.830
Robertson's waiting for
the DNA on Jesse's watch.

21:37.897 --> 21:40.032
And I'd be a hell
of a lot happier

21:40.099 --> 21:42.234
if a real cop was our suspect.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.203
You mean Rudy?

21:44.270 --> 21:46.205
And a signed confession.

21:46.272 --> 21:48.441
It never hurts.

21:48.508 --> 21:50.343
See you
in the morning.

21:58.885 --> 22:00.119
Where's Joe?

22:00.186 --> 22:03.189
I destroyed a Scuttle Crab
in Summoner's Rift,

22:03.255 --> 22:04.524
and he gave up.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.366
Doing some work.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.102
Yeah, little bit at a time.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.104
Gonna flip it eventually.

22:19.406 --> 22:20.773
What's up?

22:20.840 --> 22:21.874
WiFi problems.

22:21.941 --> 22:24.977
Not really my area
of expertise, Sam.

22:25.044 --> 22:27.847
Yeah, well, the Geek Squad
ran some tests,

22:27.914 --> 22:31.418
and, uh, seems that somebody's
hacked into my modem.

22:31.484 --> 22:33.252
They're downloading
humongous files.

22:33.319 --> 22:34.754
No kidding? That's wild.

22:34.821 --> 22:37.289
Yeah. I bought
some extra bandwidth,

22:37.356 --> 22:41.861
but, uh, on the weekends
it's still just a trickle.

22:41.928 --> 22:43.295
Starts Friday night

22:43.362 --> 22:48.367
and goes back to normal
late on Sunday afternoon.

22:48.435 --> 22:49.702
I still don't get it.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.337
It's coming
from your house, Jerry.

22:51.404 --> 22:52.839
What is?

22:52.905 --> 22:54.140
The downloading.

22:59.145 --> 23:00.212
Every weekend?

23:00.279 --> 23:02.048
Friday through Sunday.

23:03.783 --> 23:05.452
I'll take care of it,
Sam.

23:05.518 --> 23:06.986
Thank you.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.400
Talk to me.

23:21.468 --> 23:23.369
I'm sorry.

23:23.436 --> 23:26.573
We'll get to that.
What were you thinking?

23:27.940 --> 23:30.042
We've got internet.

23:30.109 --> 23:31.177
It's not fast enough.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.779
Not fast enough for what?

23:34.313 --> 23:35.848
Remember
the Rosetta thing

23:35.915 --> 23:37.416
I asked for
for my birthday?

23:37.484 --> 23:39.285
Language lessons?

23:39.351 --> 23:41.854
They were a little
too expensive.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.856
I found them online
for free,

23:43.923 --> 23:45.424
only it takes
forever to download.

23:45.492 --> 23:48.060
That's not free.
That's stealing.

23:50.196 --> 23:51.564
This stops now.

23:53.032 --> 23:54.066
Yes, sir.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.138
What languages?

24:00.873 --> 24:03.643
Chinese, Russian, Gaelic.

24:04.511 --> 24:05.778
Gaelic?

24:42.114 --> 24:43.550
Your city.

24:44.851 --> 24:45.985
And yours.

24:47.854 --> 24:51.423
I don't have famous chefs
and restaurants like this

24:51.490 --> 24:53.125
on speed dial.

24:55.595 --> 24:58.698
Who do you have
on speed dial?

25:00.600 --> 25:03.836
Two karaoke bars
and a masseuse.

25:05.705 --> 25:08.240
Well, I think that's way more
interesting than mine.

25:10.042 --> 25:11.611
Ever karaoke?

25:12.812 --> 25:14.614
I have too much
respect for music

25:14.681 --> 25:16.315
to desecrate it
with my voice.

25:16.382 --> 25:18.551
Ah.
What kind of music?

25:18.618 --> 25:20.419
All kinds.

25:20.486 --> 25:22.822
Something special
to you.

25:25.958 --> 25:26.959
Hmm.

25:27.026 --> 25:27.994
Ahem.

25:30.229 --> 25:33.365
Les mystères
des voix bulgares.

25:33.432 --> 25:35.067
The Bulgarian
Women's Choir,

25:35.134 --> 25:36.368
Kaval Sviri?

25:36.435 --> 25:38.170
You know it?

25:39.538 --> 25:40.707
It was the theme music

25:40.773 --> 25:42.241
for "Xena,
Warrior Princess."

25:44.611 --> 25:45.878
Xena.

25:45.945 --> 25:49.281
I watched every episode
when I was 10.

25:49.348 --> 25:50.983
Ah.

25:51.050 --> 25:51.818
Allô.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.119
Verdict, mademoiselle?

25:53.185 --> 25:54.420
Oh. Magnificent.

25:54.486 --> 25:55.554
Irving?

25:55.622 --> 25:56.689
Delicious, Laurent.

25:56.756 --> 25:57.757
- A triumph, as always.
- Bien.

25:57.824 --> 25:58.958
Thank you, again,

25:59.025 --> 26:00.559
so much
for this evening.

26:00.627 --> 26:02.729
The Chief always
has a table here.

26:02.795 --> 26:04.196
And you're welcome
to come without him, too.

26:04.263 --> 26:05.598
Any time.

26:05.665 --> 26:07.033
I just may do that.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.901
Bonsoir.

26:08.968 --> 26:10.236
Bonsoir.

26:10.302 --> 26:11.771
Bonsoir.

26:15.341 --> 26:17.176
Your own table?

26:19.211 --> 26:22.281
He's an old friend.

26:22.348 --> 26:23.783
And I thought, um...

26:25.017 --> 26:27.654
why not something special
for this evening?

26:30.256 --> 26:32.191
Thank you.

26:35.494 --> 26:37.263
Let's have another.

26:40.132 --> 26:41.300
Let's.

26:43.002 --> 26:46.138
How the fuck do you even
know what he said to them?

26:48.174 --> 26:49.642
You don't know.

26:49.709 --> 26:52.645
You don't know
what he said.

26:52.712 --> 26:55.314
He had his story.
He stuck to it.

26:55.381 --> 26:56.749
Unless he didn't.

26:56.816 --> 26:59.118
If they had anything,
they would have charged him.

26:59.185 --> 27:01.888
And who knows what he
would have said then?

27:01.954 --> 27:05.391
I do. He would have said
"I want a lawyer."

27:05.457 --> 27:06.826
But they didn't charge him

27:06.893 --> 27:09.862
because he knew
exactly what to say.

27:09.929 --> 27:12.331
Why'd they pick him up
in the first place?

27:12.398 --> 27:14.734
Fishing expedition.

27:14.801 --> 27:16.869
They thought
they had something.

27:16.936 --> 27:19.038
They didn't get
what they needed.

27:19.105 --> 27:20.406
And they won't.

27:34.220 --> 27:35.955
Are we good?

28:03.049 --> 28:05.184
Volleyball.
Travel. Team.

28:07.619 --> 28:09.321
I finally got a hold
of your mom.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.824
- She is hard to reach.
- I know, right?

28:11.891 --> 28:14.660
I convinced her to let you
join the travel team.

28:14.727 --> 28:17.730
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

28:17.797 --> 28:20.432
Aw, okay, that's one too many
thank yous. Now I feel guilty.

28:20.499 --> 28:21.868
For what?

28:21.934 --> 28:23.669
I didn't actually
have to convince her.

28:23.736 --> 28:26.072
Oh, I know.
She told me last week
it was all up to you.

28:28.140 --> 28:29.075
Night.

28:29.141 --> 28:30.076
Good night.

28:58.805 --> 29:00.206
Any sign of our boy?

29:00.272 --> 29:02.708
Not a whiff.
Your boy's a ghost.

29:02.775 --> 29:04.844
If you need coffee,
and you will,

29:04.911 --> 29:06.578
the place down
the beach is fire.

29:06.645 --> 29:07.947
Thanks.

29:08.014 --> 29:10.149
You want us for backup?

29:10.216 --> 29:10.950
For a ghost? No.

29:11.017 --> 29:12.852
Go get some sleep.

29:19.926 --> 29:21.260
Whatever you decide, Irv,

29:21.327 --> 29:23.395
you have my complete
confidence.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.399
Look,
here's the problem, Joel.

29:29.435 --> 29:31.703
The timing's bad.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.006
This IA complaint
against Bosch

29:34.073 --> 29:36.075
might have negative
residual effects

29:36.142 --> 29:38.277
on a murder case that's
about to go to trial.

29:40.546 --> 29:42.381
Sergeant Snyder,

29:42.448 --> 29:44.216
she's got a good case.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.819
She's been meticulous
and fair.

29:46.886 --> 29:48.620
I'm sure she has.

29:48.687 --> 29:50.289
But we don't want to confuse

29:50.356 --> 29:52.892
being a pain in the ass
with being a bad cop.

29:56.028 --> 29:58.730
The department's really
hoping for unfounded here

29:58.797 --> 30:00.432
or, at least, unresolved.

30:00.499 --> 30:03.669
Irv, shouldn't we just
let Snyder do her job?

30:03.735 --> 30:05.972
Of course.
It's your call.

30:06.038 --> 30:07.673
You do whatever
you have to do.

30:07.739 --> 30:09.775
But, uh, tell me.

30:09.842 --> 30:11.210
Ahem.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.545
Do you really
want a detective

30:13.612 --> 30:16.248
who's cleared 33 murders
in the last ten years

30:16.315 --> 30:19.418
riding a bench?
Even for a few days?

30:22.855 --> 30:24.957
Be patient, Joel.

30:25.024 --> 30:27.293
Don't waste your
time on this one.

30:27.359 --> 30:29.428
It's Bosch.

30:29.495 --> 30:32.031
He'll give you
just cause soon enough.

30:32.098 --> 30:34.200
Matter of time.
And when that happens,

30:34.266 --> 30:37.136
the department will
back you 100%.

30:39.605 --> 30:41.440
How's Maddie doing?

30:41.507 --> 30:43.609
She's doing okay.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.277
Misses her mom.

30:47.379 --> 30:50.249
How'd Jack do with
that science fair thing?

30:50.316 --> 30:51.450
Third place.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.619
In the city.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.787
Good for him.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.124
You want to see
if Dexter knows coffee?

30:58.991 --> 31:00.326
Yeah, that'd be good.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.561
If our ghost shows,
hit me on the rover.

31:02.628 --> 31:03.963
Do not brace this guy alone.

31:04.030 --> 31:05.431
When do I ever do that?

31:05.497 --> 31:06.933
Right back.

31:20.846 --> 31:22.048
Bosch.

31:22.114 --> 31:23.382
You the detective

31:23.449 --> 31:25.451
who sent out a flyer
on a dark gray SUV?

31:25.517 --> 31:26.785
Who's calling?

31:26.852 --> 31:28.620
Hector at Archer's Towing.

31:28.687 --> 31:30.156
Might have got
something.

31:30.222 --> 31:31.857
Probably ought
to take a look.

31:31.924 --> 31:33.759
Soon as I can,
which is not right now.

31:33.825 --> 31:35.227
Where'd you find it?

31:35.294 --> 31:37.196
Apartment complex garage
in Studio City,

31:37.263 --> 31:38.897
near Vineland and Ventura.

31:38.965 --> 31:41.167
Text me the exact address.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.901
Hold it for prints
till I get there.

31:42.969 --> 31:44.270
Will do.

31:47.606 --> 31:49.575
Yeah, I'm just gonna
clean the place up,

31:49.641 --> 31:52.244
and then, uh,
aloha, baby.

31:53.812 --> 31:55.081
Call you back.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.319
Aah!

32:03.689 --> 32:04.690
Shit.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.458
Officer needs help.

32:06.525 --> 32:07.859
Shots fired.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.261
Coffee bar
near the boardwalk.

32:09.328 --> 32:11.263
I do not have eyes
on my partner

32:19.205 --> 32:21.807
6-William-22.
Officer needs help.

32:21.873 --> 32:23.742
Shots fired.
Suspect is down.

32:23.809 --> 32:25.144
I am at Espresso Yo'self.

32:25.211 --> 32:27.879
Coffee Bar on
Oceanfront Walk, Venice.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.449
I need the paramedics
and supervisor.

32:36.022 --> 32:37.990
You okay, partner?

32:42.261 --> 32:44.030
Walk us through again?

32:44.096 --> 32:45.697
The workup to it
or the actual--

32:45.764 --> 32:48.334
Start with the trajectory
of your shot this time.

32:56.542 --> 32:57.876
Wasn't complicated.

32:57.943 --> 32:59.445
He didn't get a shot off?

32:59.511 --> 33:00.412
He did not.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.848
But you could see
that he was armed?

33:02.914 --> 33:04.650
I saw him reach for his gun.

33:07.086 --> 33:09.988
When he hit the ground,
the Glock fell out.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.525
Whole thing took two,
maybe three seconds.

33:13.592 --> 33:15.761
You did not see the weapon
before you fired?

33:15.827 --> 33:17.129
I did not.

33:17.196 --> 33:18.830
But his body language
was clear.

33:18.897 --> 33:22.268
He was armed.
He intended to shoot me.

33:22.334 --> 33:23.502
Okay.

33:25.337 --> 33:27.206
Let's start again
from the beginning.

33:27.273 --> 33:30.142
When the overnight
team left.

33:31.543 --> 33:34.113
How long before you
went to get coffee?

35:11.410 --> 35:13.111
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:13.179 --> 35:14.246
How's Edgar?

35:14.313 --> 35:15.447
He's still in with FID,

35:15.514 --> 35:17.149
but I'll be there
when he gets out.

35:17.216 --> 35:18.884
Give me a call.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.186
You find anything?

35:20.252 --> 35:21.753
Dobbs and Moreno are gone.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.989
You got surveillance
in place pretty quick.

35:24.055 --> 35:25.891
Yeah.
Don't expect anything.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.760
They got their money.
No reason not to get
the fuck out of Dodge.

35:30.962 --> 35:31.963
What?

35:32.030 --> 35:33.599
They're Special Forces.

35:33.665 --> 35:34.700
So?

35:34.766 --> 35:37.035
So they could go
after Jerry. Payback.

35:37.102 --> 35:38.170
Really, Harry?

35:38.237 --> 35:39.905
I mean, they got
what they came for.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.006
Their cover's blown.

35:41.072 --> 35:42.941
He's a cop. That's crazy.

35:43.008 --> 35:44.576
That's what RHD said
when I called:

35:44.643 --> 35:46.478
doesn't rise
to criminal threat.

35:48.214 --> 35:50.516
I'll put two Hollywood
guys on it.

35:50.582 --> 35:51.550
Please.

35:52.784 --> 35:55.887
- How's J. Edgar?
- He's okay.

35:55.954 --> 35:57.456
Now can we pick up Moreno?

35:57.523 --> 36:00.459
Too late, brother.
They're in the wind.

36:14.406 --> 36:17.343
Looks like they put you
through it, brother.

36:17.409 --> 36:19.711
Is that a wrinkle I see?

36:19.778 --> 36:21.347
Fuck you, Harry.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.449
How you holding up?

36:24.516 --> 36:26.385
I've had better days.

36:35.361 --> 36:36.828
You hungry?

36:38.163 --> 36:40.299
You gotta eat.

37:07.192 --> 37:09.861
It bothers me more
than I thought it would.

37:09.928 --> 37:11.597
More than Nash?

37:13.865 --> 37:15.867
This is different.

37:15.934 --> 37:17.803
It's personal.

37:17.869 --> 37:20.406
Face-to-face.
You know, close range.

37:20.472 --> 37:22.541
He made a move.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.142
No choice.

37:24.209 --> 37:26.712
I was lucky.

37:26.778 --> 37:28.213
I wasn't ready.

37:28.280 --> 37:29.981
It took me by surprise.

37:31.450 --> 37:34.586
Survival.
Training kicked in.

37:37.456 --> 37:39.190
Ask yourself:

37:39.257 --> 37:40.792
anything else
you could have done?

37:40.859 --> 37:44.129
I wish I would have
seen him sooner.

37:44.195 --> 37:45.831
Maybe I could've
taken him down without--

37:45.897 --> 37:46.965
He called it, Jerry.

37:47.032 --> 37:48.667
Not what you wanted.

37:50.669 --> 37:51.937
I guess.

37:53.171 --> 37:54.540
So ask the question.

37:54.606 --> 37:58.276
Run it from...
every angle.

37:59.311 --> 38:03.014
When you know
the movie by heart,

38:03.081 --> 38:05.216
you put it in a box

38:05.283 --> 38:07.953
with all the other
bad shit we see.

38:09.187 --> 38:10.322
It won't go away?

38:10.389 --> 38:12.458
No. It won't.

38:12.524 --> 38:14.426
You live with it.

38:15.661 --> 38:17.563
Remind me what else we
need to look forward to.

38:17.629 --> 38:20.332
- BSS.
- Oh, fuck.

38:20.399 --> 38:22.100
Remember the big question:

38:22.167 --> 38:24.035
"Are you sleeping okay,
detective?"

38:24.102 --> 38:25.404
Like a baby.

38:25.471 --> 38:27.439
And stay away
from the news.

38:27.506 --> 38:29.775
Really?
They're not on our side?

38:36.181 --> 38:37.516
I didn't see the gun,
Harry.

38:37.583 --> 38:39.385
You knew he had one.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.492
You knew it.

38:47.493 --> 38:49.661
Wait a tenth of a second,

38:49.728 --> 38:52.063
LaTonya's raising
Jack and Joe on her own.

39:06.277 --> 39:08.814
Hey. How's J. Edgar?

39:08.880 --> 39:11.016
He's dealing with it.

39:11.082 --> 39:14.152
Listen, uh, tell him--

39:14.219 --> 39:16.154
ah, you know
what to tell him.

39:16.221 --> 39:17.423
What's up?

39:17.489 --> 39:19.057
Well, I'm on my deck,

39:19.124 --> 39:20.526
and I'm looking out
at a fire.

39:20.592 --> 39:22.628
Just wanted to make sure
somebody called it in.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.262
Half hour ago.

39:24.329 --> 39:25.697
What's burning?

39:25.764 --> 39:28.434
River Watch
Retirement Community.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.335
Who's lead on it?

39:30.402 --> 39:32.704
So far? Darnell.

39:32.771 --> 39:34.305
I used to visit
a guy there.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.575
Retired detective
John Caffrey.

39:36.642 --> 39:38.376
When you
talk to Darney,

39:38.444 --> 39:39.911
ask him if he
made it through.

39:39.978 --> 39:41.480
Let me know, yeah?

39:41.547 --> 39:42.914
Roger that.
