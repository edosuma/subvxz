00:53.920 --> 00:58.448
<i>Once upon a time,
there was a girl called Ella.</i>

01:00.280 --> 01:02.620
<i>And she saw the world
not always as it was,</i>

01:02.720 --> 01:07.123
<i>but as perhaps it could be,
with just a little bit of magic.</i>

01:11.120 --> 01:12.340
My darling!

01:12.440 --> 01:15.700
<i>To her mother and father,
she was a princess.</i>

01:15.800 --> 01:19.202
<i>True, she had no title,
nor crown, nor castle,</i>

01:19.600 --> 01:22.740
<i>but she was the ruler
of her own little kingdom,</i>

01:22.840 --> 01:26.740
<i>whose borders were the house
and meadow on the forest's edge</i>

01:26.840 --> 01:29.810
<i>where her people
had lived for generations.</i>

01:31.640 --> 01:32.801
<i>With Mr. Goose</i>

01:34.440 --> 01:36.488
<i>and all their animal family.</i>

01:38.280 --> 01:41.220
Hello, there.
What do you think you're doing?

01:41.320 --> 01:43.084
Let the little ones have their share.

01:43.360 --> 01:46.523
We don't want you getting
an upset stomach.

01:47.480 --> 01:50.580
Gus-Gus, you're a house mouse,
not a garden mouse.

01:50.680 --> 01:52.340
Isn't he, Jacqueline?

01:52.440 --> 01:55.100
And you mustn't eat Mr. Goose's food.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.340
Isn't that right, Mummy?

01:56.440 --> 01:58.740
Do you still believe
that they understand you?

01:58.840 --> 02:01.127
- Don't they, Mother?
- Yes.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.620
I believe that animals listen
and speak to us

02:04.720 --> 02:06.370
if we only have the ear for it.

02:08.160 --> 02:09.900
That's how we learn to look after them.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.206
Who looks after us?

02:11.520 --> 02:13.780
Fairy godmothers, of course.

02:13.880 --> 02:15.420
And do you believe in them?

02:15.520 --> 02:16.900
I believe in everything.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.241
Then I believe in everything, too.

02:22.120 --> 02:23.900
<i>Her father was a merchant</i>

02:24.000 --> 02:25.180
<i>who went abroad</i>

02:25.280 --> 02:29.100
<i>and brought tribute back from
all of Ella's subject lands.</i>

02:29.200 --> 02:30.645
Ella!

02:31.360 --> 02:34.569
Where are my girls, my beautiful girls?

02:36.240 --> 02:37.924
Where are my darlings?

02:39.040 --> 02:41.620
<i>Ella missed him terribly
when he was away.</i>

02:41.720 --> 02:43.900
<i>But she knew he would always return.</i>

02:44.000 --> 02:46.020
- There she is!
- Papa, welcome home!

02:46.120 --> 02:47.167
How are you?

02:48.320 --> 02:49.526
You've grown!

02:49.920 --> 02:51.331
Haven't you, now?

02:52.880 --> 02:54.882
- There you go, sir.
- What was that?

02:55.400 --> 02:56.780
This?

02:56.880 --> 02:58.780
I found it hanging on a tree.

02:58.880 --> 03:03.010
I think there may be something inside.

03:08.920 --> 03:10.729
It's so pretty.

03:11.720 --> 03:14.530
In French, that is <i>un papillon</i>.

03:25.240 --> 03:26.571
You're standing on my feet.

03:28.240 --> 03:29.241
Shall we?

03:31.920 --> 03:33.922
Look, Mummy! I'm dancing!

03:46.920 --> 03:48.888
Little <i>papillon</i>.

03:51.120 --> 03:53.500
<i>All was just as it should be.</i>

03:53.600 --> 03:57.380
<i>They knew themselves to be the most
happy of families to live as they did</i>

03:57.480 --> 03:59.420
<i>and to love each other so.</i>

03:59.520 --> 04:02.180
<i>When I am king dilly, dilly</i>

04:02.280 --> 04:04.806
<i>You shall be queen</i>

04:05.440 --> 04:08.180
<i>Lavender's green dilly, dilly</i>

04:08.280 --> 04:10.760
<i>Lavender's blue</i>

04:11.120 --> 04:13.820
<i>You must love me dilly, dilly</i>

04:13.920 --> 04:16.651
<i>For I love you</i>

04:22.960 --> 04:26.540
<i>But sorrow can come to any kingdom,</i>

04:26.640 --> 04:28.768
<i>no matter how happy.</i>

04:35.680 --> 04:38.206
<i>And so it came to Ella's home.</i>

04:41.640 --> 04:42.900
I'm so sorry.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.764
Thank you, Doctor.

04:45.360 --> 04:47.169
This must have been
very difficult for you.

04:50.800 --> 04:52.040
Come.

04:52.320 --> 04:53.526
Ella.

05:08.560 --> 05:10.961
Ella, my darling.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.842
I want to tell you a secret.

05:14.400 --> 05:17.100
A great secret that will see you through

05:17.200 --> 05:19.043
all the trials that life can offer.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.727
You must always remember this.

05:24.320 --> 05:27.051
Have courage and be kind.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.260
You have more kindness
in your little finger

05:31.360 --> 05:34.500
than most people possess
in their whole body.

05:34.600 --> 05:39.128
And it has power, more than you know.

05:40.920 --> 05:42.860
- And magic.
- Magic?

05:42.960 --> 05:43.961
Truly.

05:45.720 --> 05:49.202
Have courage and be kind, my darling.

05:50.880 --> 05:52.086
Will you promise me?

05:52.400 --> 05:53.606
I promise.

05:54.400 --> 05:55.401
Good.

05:56.240 --> 05:57.287
Good.

05:58.720 --> 05:59.721
And...

06:01.560 --> 06:04.484
I must go very soon, my love.

06:06.120 --> 06:07.963
Please forgive me.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.762
Of course I forgive you.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.690
I love you.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.569
I love you, my darling.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.605
I love you.

06:42.280 --> 06:47.161
<i>Time passed, and pain turned to memory.</i>

06:59.680 --> 07:02.490
<i>In her heart, Ella stayed the same.</i>

07:03.160 --> 07:06.323
<i>For she remembered
her promise to her mother.</i>

07:06.680 --> 07:09.604
<i>Have courage, and be kind.</i>

07:14.320 --> 07:17.020
<i>Father, however, was much changed.</i>

07:17.120 --> 07:19.487
<i>But he hoped for better times.</i>

07:21.440 --> 07:23.283
"And thence home,

07:23.640 --> 07:26.962
"and my wife and I singing,
to our great content,

07:27.480 --> 07:30.380
"and if ever there were a man
happier in his fortunes,

07:30.480 --> 07:32.289
"I know him not."

07:33.160 --> 07:35.481
Thus ends Mr. Pepys for today.

07:35.880 --> 07:37.928
I do love a happy ending, don't you?

07:38.520 --> 07:40.841
They're quite my favorite sort.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.165
As well they should be.

07:43.680 --> 07:44.681
Ella,

07:45.160 --> 07:50.405
I have come to the conclusion
that it's time, perhaps,

07:51.360 --> 07:53.203
to begin a new chapter.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.140
Indeed, Father?

07:55.240 --> 07:57.420
You'll recall that some time ago,
in my travels,

07:57.520 --> 07:59.921
I made the acquaintance
of Sir Francis Tremaine.

08:00.040 --> 08:01.260
Yes.

08:01.360 --> 08:04.500
The Master of the Mercer's Guild,
is he not?

08:04.600 --> 08:05.620
Was.

08:05.720 --> 08:07.449
The poor man has died, alas.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.845
His widow,

08:11.400 --> 08:13.300
an honorable woman,

08:13.400 --> 08:15.780
finds herself alone,

08:15.880 --> 08:18.042
though still in the prime of her life.

08:20.720 --> 08:22.848
You're worried about telling me.

08:23.360 --> 08:25.203
But you mustn't be.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.460
Not if it will lead to your happiness.

08:28.560 --> 08:29.846
Yes.

08:30.560 --> 08:32.049
Happiness.

08:33.200 --> 08:37.330
Do you think
I may be allowed one last chance,

08:38.039 --> 08:40.246
even though I thought
such things were done with for good?

08:41.480 --> 08:43.960
Of course I do, Father.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.100
She'll merely be your stepmother.

08:50.200 --> 08:53.488
And you'll have two lovely sisters
to keep you company.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.807
Have courage, be kind.

09:14.240 --> 09:17.050
Welcome, ladies. Welcome!

09:17.440 --> 09:18.860
She's skinny as a broomstick!

09:18.960 --> 09:20.803
And that stringy hair!

09:21.280 --> 09:22.500
You're very nice.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.380
Welcome. I'm so happy to meet you.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.460
You have such pretty hair.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.900
- Thank you.
- You should have it styled.

09:29.000 --> 09:29.980
I'm sure you're right.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.684
- Would you like a tour of the house?
- What did she say?

09:31.800 --> 09:33.540
She wants to show us
around her farmhouse.

09:33.640 --> 09:36.405
- She's proud of it, I think.
- Do they keep animals inside?

09:40.440 --> 09:43.649
How charming. How perfectly charming.

09:44.760 --> 09:45.966
Lucifer.

09:47.480 --> 09:48.860
<i>Her stepmother-to-be</i>

09:48.960 --> 09:52.460
<i>was a woman of keen feeling
and refined taste.</i>

09:52.560 --> 09:55.620
<i>And she, too, had known grief.</i>

09:55.720 --> 09:58.405
<i>But she wore it wonderfully well.</i>

10:27.880 --> 10:31.123
You did not say
your daughter was so beautiful.

10:31.520 --> 10:32.885
She takes after her...

10:34.640 --> 10:36.005
Her mother.

10:37.840 --> 10:39.080
Just so.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.260
What does Mummy mean?
What's so charming about it?

10:41.360 --> 10:42.780
She's lying. That's just good manners.

10:42.880 --> 10:43.961
Shut up.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.540
How long has your family lived here?

10:46.640 --> 10:47.660
Over 200 years.

10:47.760 --> 10:49.740
And in all that time,
they never thought to decorate?

10:49.840 --> 10:52.923
Anastasia, hush.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.967
They'll think you are in earnest.

10:57.520 --> 11:00.940
<i>Ella's stepmother,
high-spirited lady that she was,</i>

11:01.040 --> 11:04.647
<i>set out to restore life
and laughter to the house.</i>

11:07.360 --> 11:09.806
You are awful, Baron.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.967
Fortune favors me again.

11:22.040 --> 11:25.340
Well, look who's having
a party of their own.

11:25.440 --> 11:29.445
Jacqueline, Teddy, Matilda,
greedy Gus-Gus.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.020
Just what...

11:36.120 --> 11:39.300
Yes, what do you think
you're up to, Lucifer?

11:39.400 --> 11:43.564
Jacqueline is my guest,
and the eating of guests is not allowed.

11:44.640 --> 11:45.820
Go on, now.

11:45.920 --> 11:48.241
You've plenty of cat food
to keep you happy.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.202
We ladies must help one another.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.100
You're missing the party.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.771
I imagine it's much
like all the other ones.

12:02.240 --> 12:03.940
And I'm leaving first thing, El.

12:04.040 --> 12:05.500
No. But you're...

12:05.600 --> 12:08.126
You're hardly back from the last trip.

12:09.600 --> 12:10.700
Do you have to go?

12:10.800 --> 12:12.882
It's just a few months, my darling.

12:15.760 --> 12:18.020
What would you like me
to bring you home from abroad?

12:18.120 --> 12:19.460
You know, your sisters...

12:19.560 --> 12:21.820
Stepsisters, have asked for

12:21.920 --> 12:24.400
parasols and lace.

12:25.400 --> 12:26.686
What will you have?

12:28.240 --> 12:32.484
Bring me the first branch
your shoulder brushes on your journey.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.380
That's a curious request.

12:35.480 --> 12:39.020
Well, you'll have to take it with you
on your way

12:39.120 --> 12:41.646
and think of me when you look at it.

12:42.320 --> 12:46.006
And when you bring it back,
it means that you'll be with it.

12:47.520 --> 12:49.761
And that's what I really want.

12:50.840 --> 12:52.808
For you to come back.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.201
No matter what.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.411
I will.

13:02.160 --> 13:05.209
Ella, while I'm away,

13:05.560 --> 13:07.900
I want you to be good to your stepmother

13:08.000 --> 13:10.207
and stepsisters, even though they may be

13:10.720 --> 13:13.041
trying at times.

13:14.520 --> 13:16.170
- I promise.
- Thank you.

13:16.560 --> 13:19.166
I always leave
a part of me behind, Ella.

13:20.520 --> 13:21.851
Remember that.

13:22.600 --> 13:27.367
And your mother's here, too,
though you see her not.

13:28.360 --> 13:30.044
She's the very heart of this place.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.740
And that's why
we must cherish this house,

13:33.840 --> 13:35.444
always, for her.

13:38.760 --> 13:40.330
I miss her.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.245
Do you?

13:45.080 --> 13:46.491
Very much.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.100
Remember the lace!
I simply must have it!

14:03.200 --> 14:04.740
And my parasol!

14:04.840 --> 14:06.700
For my complexion!

14:06.800 --> 14:09.406
That means skin, if you don't know!

14:12.560 --> 14:13.891
Bye!

14:14.320 --> 14:15.980
Bye, Ella!

14:16.080 --> 14:17.100
I love you!

14:17.200 --> 14:19.248
I love you, too!

14:22.360 --> 14:23.930
Bye!

14:45.520 --> 14:47.090
Ella, dear.

14:56.160 --> 14:58.401
Now, now. Mustn't blub.

15:00.160 --> 15:01.300
Yes, Stepmother.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.368
You needn't call me that.

15:04.520 --> 15:06.220
"Madam" will do.

15:06.320 --> 15:08.180
There isn't room for me
and all of your clothes!

15:08.280 --> 15:10.500
Well, then make yourself smaller!

15:10.600 --> 15:13.444
Anastasia and Drisella
have always shared a room.

15:13.720 --> 15:16.041
Such dear, affectionate girls.

15:17.040 --> 15:19.700
Or... Or better yet, disappear entirely!

15:19.800 --> 15:21.100
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

15:21.200 --> 15:22.964
Sometimes I could scratch your eyes out!

15:23.640 --> 15:27.122
I think they're finding
the sleeping quarters rather confining.

15:28.120 --> 15:31.647
Well, my bedroom's the biggest
besides yours and Father's.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.048
Perhaps they'd like to share it.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.580
What a wonderful idea.

15:36.680 --> 15:38.842
What a good girl you are.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.060
I can stay in the...

15:41.160 --> 15:42.491
The attic.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.326
Quite so.

15:46.840 --> 15:47.900
The attic?

15:48.000 --> 15:48.940
Yes.

15:49.040 --> 15:53.740
Only temporarily, while I have
all the other rooms redecorated.

15:53.840 --> 15:55.420
The attic's so nice and airy

15:55.520 --> 15:58.900
and you'll be away
from all of our fuss and bother.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.220
You'd be even more cozy

16:00.320 --> 16:04.723
if you kept all this bric-a-brac
up there with you.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.249
Keep you amused.

16:43.560 --> 16:44.721
Well,

16:46.560 --> 16:48.881
no one shall disturb me here.

17:07.400 --> 17:08.970
Hello, Gus-Gus.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.082
Go on, Gus-Gus, you can do it.

17:21.240 --> 17:23.003
So this is where you take refuge.

17:25.359 --> 17:26.930
Me too, it would seem.

17:28.240 --> 17:29.241
Right.

17:30.680 --> 17:31.700
Who's going to help me?

17:31.800 --> 17:32.780
Simpleton.

17:32.880 --> 17:33.900
That is the last straw.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.765
Our little sister, up there,
talking to the woodworm.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.284
How very pleasant.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.645
No cats,

17:44.280 --> 17:46.442
and no stepsisters.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.180
We have a halfwit for a sister.

17:49.280 --> 17:50.500
I've got two.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.060
I heard that.

17:52.160 --> 17:54.128
- Who is she talking to?
- She's mad.

17:59.120 --> 18:02.124
<i>Sing, sweet nightingale</i>

18:02.440 --> 18:04.020
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Miss Ella.

18:04.120 --> 18:05.804
Good morning, Tom!

18:09.880 --> 18:11.180
<i>Sing sweet...</i>

18:11.280 --> 18:13.442
Hello. Don't mind if I...

18:13.840 --> 18:16.446
What a lovely Chantecler. Well done.

18:16.680 --> 18:17.681
Thanks.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.565
- 'Morning.
- 'Morning.

18:23.400 --> 18:24.540
Thank you, Miss Ella.

18:24.640 --> 18:25.846
You're welcome.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.420
Ella!

18:32.520 --> 18:35.300
Wake up, girls! It's lunch time!

18:35.400 --> 18:39.041
<i>Mornings did not agree
with Ella's stepsisters.</i>

18:43.680 --> 18:45.020
<i>And they lacked accomplishment</i>

18:45.120 --> 18:47.487
<i>in such domestic arts as keeping house.</i>

18:48.760 --> 18:51.525
<i>In fact, they lacked
accomplishment in any art.</i>

18:52.680 --> 18:58.460
<i>It was a lover and his lass</i>

18:58.560 --> 19:01.086
<i>With a hey, and a ho</i>

19:01.200 --> 19:03.620
<i>And a hey nonino</i>

19:03.720 --> 19:09.363
<i>That o'er the green corn-field did pass</i>

19:09.480 --> 19:12.260
<i>Sweet lovers love</i>

19:12.360 --> 19:14.522
<i>The spring</i>

19:51.000 --> 19:53.401
<i>Sweet lovers love</i>

19:53.800 --> 19:56.485
<i>The spring</i>

20:02.160 --> 20:03.525
Do shut up.

20:05.720 --> 20:07.060
<i>Ella's great comfort</i>

20:07.160 --> 20:10.540
<i>were the letters that Father
would send from his travels.</i>

20:10.640 --> 20:12.780
<i>The weeks away lengthened to months,</i>

20:12.880 --> 20:16.248
<i>but every day would bring his
thoughts from some distant part.</i>

20:16.360 --> 20:17.940
Miss Ella, it's the mail coach!

20:18.040 --> 20:20.771
<i>Until late one afternoon...</i>

20:21.720 --> 20:23.404
Farmer John?

20:24.720 --> 20:26.051
Miss Ella.

20:26.160 --> 20:28.083
It's your father, miss.

20:29.120 --> 20:31.441
He took ill on the road.

20:33.320 --> 20:35.129
He's passed on, miss.

20:36.680 --> 20:38.045
He's gone.

20:39.920 --> 20:43.129
To the end, he spoke only of you, miss.

20:43.600 --> 20:44.761
And your mother.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.881
I was to give you this.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.860
But what about my lace?

20:51.960 --> 20:53.803
My parasol?

20:54.480 --> 20:57.131
Can't you see? None of that matters.

20:58.960 --> 21:00.405
We're ruined.

21:02.320 --> 21:03.685
How will we live?

21:11.120 --> 21:12.485
Thank you.

21:15.080 --> 21:17.811
It must have been
very difficult for you.

22:06.360 --> 22:08.260
<i>How indeed to live.</i>

22:08.360 --> 22:10.380
<i>Economies had to be taken.</i>

22:10.480 --> 22:13.802
<i>Ella's stepmother
dismissed the household.</i>

22:30.760 --> 22:34.845
<i>Her stepmother and stepsisters
ever misused her.</i>

22:35.880 --> 22:38.087
<i>And by and by they considered Ella</i>

22:38.600 --> 22:41.570
<i>less a sister than a servant.</i>

22:43.760 --> 22:46.650
<i>And so Ella was left to do all the work.</i>

22:48.880 --> 22:53.100
<i>This was a good thing,
for it distracted her from her grief.</i>

22:53.200 --> 22:55.601
<i>At least that was what
her stepmother said.</i>

22:58.080 --> 23:01.289
<i>And she and her two daughters
were more than happy</i>

23:01.400 --> 23:05.405
<i>to provide Ella
with lots and lots of distraction.</i>

23:13.000 --> 23:14.001
<i>In their defense,</i>

23:14.120 --> 23:17.283
<i>they did share with her
the very food they ate,</i>

23:17.800 --> 23:21.009
<i>or rather, the scraps from their table.</i>

23:21.960 --> 23:23.405
<i>She had little in the way of friends.</i>

23:25.080 --> 23:27.020
<i>Well, her friends were very little.</i>

23:27.120 --> 23:29.009
There you are.

23:29.760 --> 23:31.683
Have dinner with me, won't you?

23:34.600 --> 23:37.700
<i>But those friends she had,
she treated with an open heart</i>

23:37.800 --> 23:39.643
<i>and an open hand.</i>

23:44.000 --> 23:45.411
Your table.

24:04.440 --> 24:07.340
<i>Sometimes, by the end of the day,</i>

24:07.440 --> 24:10.860
<i>the drafty attic was too cold
to spend the night in,</i>

24:10.960 --> 24:13.980
<i>so she lay by the dying
embers of the hearth</i>

24:14.080 --> 24:15.730
<i>to keep warm.</i>

24:33.320 --> 24:35.780
I thought breakfast was ready.

24:35.880 --> 24:37.260
It is, madam.

24:37.360 --> 24:39.340
I'm only mending the fire.

24:39.440 --> 24:43.260
In future, can we not be called
until the work is done?

24:43.360 --> 24:44.725
As you wish.

24:46.160 --> 24:47.924
Ella, what's that on your face?

24:50.200 --> 24:51.361
Madam?

24:53.160 --> 24:55.162
It's ash from the fireplace.

24:55.880 --> 24:57.530
Do clean yourself up.

24:57.960 --> 24:59.485
You'll get cinders in our tea.

24:59.600 --> 25:02.820
I've got a new name for her!
Cinderwench.

25:02.920 --> 25:04.260
I couldn't bear to look so dirty.

25:04.360 --> 25:05.771
Dirty Ella.

25:06.520 --> 25:08.249
Cinder-ella!

25:08.600 --> 25:09.886
That's what we'll call you.

25:10.400 --> 25:12.562
Girls, you're too clever.

25:14.920 --> 25:16.490
Who's this for?

25:18.240 --> 25:20.561
Is there someone we've forgotten?

25:21.240 --> 25:22.260
It's my place.

25:22.360 --> 25:25.140
It seems too much
to expect you to prepare breakfast,

25:25.240 --> 25:27.460
serve it and still sit with us.

25:27.560 --> 25:30.820
Wouldn't you prefer to eat
when all the work is done, Ella?

25:30.920 --> 25:33.241
Or should I say, "Cinderella"?

26:19.720 --> 26:21.740
<i>Cinderella.</i>

26:21.840 --> 26:25.287
<i>Names have power, like magic spells.</i>

26:26.120 --> 26:28.020
<i>And of a sudden, it seemed to her</i>

26:28.120 --> 26:30.327
<i>that her stepmother and stepsisters</i>

26:30.440 --> 26:32.060
<i>had indeed transformed her</i>

26:32.160 --> 26:34.460
<i>into merely a creature of ash</i>

26:34.560 --> 26:35.800
<i>and toil.</i>

27:14.640 --> 27:15.620
Run!

27:15.720 --> 27:17.165
Quickly, my friend,
or they'll catch you!

27:17.640 --> 27:18.721
Go!

27:21.960 --> 27:22.961
Easy!

27:25.360 --> 27:28.980
<i>Perhaps it was just as well
that Ella's stepsisters were cruel.</i>

27:29.080 --> 27:31.620
<i>For had she not run to the forest,</i>

27:31.720 --> 27:33.404
<i>she might never have met the prince.</i>

27:35.400 --> 27:36.845
Easy! Easy!

27:38.520 --> 27:40.020
Easy, boy!

27:40.120 --> 27:41.360
Come on, boy, slow down!

27:43.280 --> 27:44.340
Miss!

27:44.440 --> 27:45.980
Miss! Are you all right?

27:46.080 --> 27:47.340
Hold on!

27:47.440 --> 27:49.260
I'm all right, thank you!

27:49.360 --> 27:50.521
That's fine.

27:57.640 --> 27:59.210
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right,

27:59.320 --> 28:01.780
but you've nearly frightened
the life out of him.

28:01.880 --> 28:03.086
Who?

28:03.200 --> 28:04.406
The stag.

28:04.880 --> 28:07.690
What's he ever done to you
that you should chase him about?

28:08.800 --> 28:11.620
I must confess
I've never met him before.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.460
He is a friend of yours?

28:13.560 --> 28:15.100
An acquaintance.

28:15.200 --> 28:16.611
We met just now.

28:18.080 --> 28:19.060
I looked into his eyes,

28:19.160 --> 28:21.420
and he looked into mine,

28:21.520 --> 28:24.460
and I just felt he had a great deal
left to do with his life.

28:24.560 --> 28:25.527
That's all.

28:25.640 --> 28:27.927
Miss, what do they call you?

28:29.680 --> 28:31.205
Never mind what they call me.

28:31.600 --> 28:34.420
You shouldn't be this deep
in the forest alone.

28:34.520 --> 28:37.171
I'm not alone. I'm with you, Mister...

28:37.840 --> 28:39.683
What do they call you?

28:40.280 --> 28:41.860
You don't know who I am?

28:41.960 --> 28:43.200
That is...

28:43.960 --> 28:45.086
They call me Kit.

28:45.200 --> 28:46.780
Well, my father does

28:46.880 --> 28:48.325
when he's in a good mood.

28:49.720 --> 28:50.767
And

28:51.920 --> 28:53.060
where do you live, Mr. Kit?

28:53.160 --> 28:54.161
At the palace.

28:54.360 --> 28:56.806
My father's teaching me his trade.

28:56.920 --> 28:58.251
You're an apprentice?

28:58.640 --> 28:59.971
Of a sort.

29:00.360 --> 29:01.860
That's very fine.

29:01.960 --> 29:03.780
Do they treat you well?

29:03.880 --> 29:06.121
Better than I deserve, most likely.

29:06.640 --> 29:07.687
And you?

29:09.360 --> 29:11.840
They treat me as well as they're able.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.331
I'm sorry.

29:15.160 --> 29:16.969
It's not your doing.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.128
Nor yours either, I'll bet.

29:22.040 --> 29:23.644
It's not so very bad.

29:23.800 --> 29:26.201
Others have it worse, I'm sure.

29:26.560 --> 29:27.721
We must

29:28.560 --> 29:32.246
simply have courage
and be kind, mustn't we?

29:33.640 --> 29:34.801
Yes.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.365
You're right.

29:38.640 --> 29:40.529
That's exactly how I feel.

29:45.360 --> 29:47.300
Please don't let them hurt him.

29:47.400 --> 29:50.100
But we're hunting, you see.
It's what's done.

29:50.200 --> 29:53.329
Just because it's what's done
doesn't mean it's what should be done.

29:53.880 --> 29:55.291
Right again.

29:56.680 --> 29:57.806
Then,

29:58.680 --> 30:00.887
you'll leave him alone, won't you?

30:03.680 --> 30:04.886
I will.

30:06.680 --> 30:09.286
Thank you very much, Mr. Kit.

30:11.760 --> 30:12.820
There you are, Your High...

30:12.920 --> 30:14.620
It's Kit! Kit!

30:14.720 --> 30:16.848
Kit! I'm Kit. I'm on my way.

30:17.760 --> 30:20.047
Well, we'd better get a move on,

30:20.240 --> 30:21.844
Mr. Kit.

30:22.440 --> 30:23.885
As I said.

30:24.360 --> 30:25.566
On my way.

30:40.560 --> 30:42.767
I hope to see you again, miss.

30:44.560 --> 30:45.891
And I, you.

31:25.920 --> 31:28.780
You sound as if you're the first fellow
ever to meet a pretty girl.

31:28.880 --> 31:30.620
She wasn't a "pretty girl."

31:30.720 --> 31:33.540
Well, she was a pretty girl,
but there was so much more to her.

31:33.640 --> 31:35.860
How much more? You've only met her once.

31:35.960 --> 31:37.340
How could you know anything about her?

31:37.440 --> 31:39.580
You told me you knew right away
when you met Mother.

31:39.680 --> 31:41.500
That's different.
Your mother was a princess.

31:41.600 --> 31:42.700
You would have loved her anyway.

31:42.800 --> 31:45.900
I would never have seen her, because
it wouldn't have been appropriate.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.601
And my father would have told me what
I'm telling you and I would have listened.

31:50.720 --> 31:51.700
- No, you wouldn't.
- Yes, I would.

31:51.800 --> 31:52.740
- No, you wouldn't.
- I would.

31:52.840 --> 31:53.887
- You wouldn't.
- You're right.

32:00.120 --> 32:01.724
Well, how is he?

32:03.440 --> 32:04.805
Your Majesty...

32:06.800 --> 32:08.325
Never mind.

32:08.960 --> 32:12.965
If it takes that long to work out a way
to say it, I already know.

32:15.960 --> 32:17.166
Father...

32:19.120 --> 32:21.009
Way of all flesh, boy.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.081
Come.

32:24.240 --> 32:25.480
We shall be late.

32:28.320 --> 32:30.380
And punctuality is the...

32:30.480 --> 32:32.608
politeness of princes.

32:32.720 --> 32:33.900
His Majesty, the King!

32:34.000 --> 32:36.620
I'm sure your father spoke to you
of your behavior in the forest.

32:36.720 --> 32:38.220
Is it any business of yours, Grand Duke?

32:38.320 --> 32:41.220
Your business is my business,
Your Royal Highness.

32:41.320 --> 32:43.220
It will not do to let the stag go free.

32:43.320 --> 32:46.340
Just because it's what's done
doesn't mean it's what should be done.

32:46.440 --> 32:47.441
Or something like that.

32:47.720 --> 32:49.820
Master Phineus,
master of the paintbrush,

32:49.920 --> 32:50.900
patiently awaits.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.082
Make him look marriageable,
Master Phineus.

32:53.200 --> 32:55.089
We must attract a suitable bride,

32:55.200 --> 32:57.740
even if he won't listen to a word I say.

32:57.840 --> 33:00.260
I shall endeavor to please,
Your Majesty.

33:00.360 --> 33:02.340
But I can't work miracles.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.580
A splendid canvas, Master Phineus.

33:04.680 --> 33:05.620
Thank you.

33:05.720 --> 33:07.500
As if he knows anything about art.

33:07.600 --> 33:10.260
So, these portraits
will really be sent abroad?

33:10.360 --> 33:13.940
To induce the high and mighty
to attend this ball you insist upon.

33:14.040 --> 33:16.220
Which is a tradition. Which is beloved.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.721
At which you will choose a bride.

33:19.040 --> 33:19.980
Fascinating.

33:20.080 --> 33:23.980
If I must marry, could I not wed, say,
a good, honest country girl?

33:24.080 --> 33:28.100
How many divisions will this
"good, honest country girl" provide us?

33:28.200 --> 33:30.300
How will she make the kingdom stronger?

33:30.400 --> 33:34.300
We are a small kingdom amongst
great states, Your Royal Highness.

33:34.400 --> 33:35.731
And it's a dangerous world.

33:37.640 --> 33:38.620
Listen, boy.

33:38.720 --> 33:40.780
- Taking you up, Master Phineus.
- Good.

33:40.880 --> 33:44.680
I want to see you and the kingdom safe.

33:45.680 --> 33:47.409
All right, Father,

33:48.400 --> 33:50.004
on one condition.

33:51.320 --> 33:55.100
Let the invitations go to everyone,
not just the nobility.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.420
The wars have brought sorrow on us all.

33:57.520 --> 33:58.780
What do you think?

33:58.880 --> 34:00.380
Would that please the people?

34:00.480 --> 34:02.660
It's beyond my wit, Your Majesty.

34:02.760 --> 34:05.923
But I wouldn't mind a bit of a jolly.

34:07.320 --> 34:09.641
I think we might have made a bargain.

34:10.360 --> 34:12.380
A ball for the people,

34:12.480 --> 34:14.164
and a princess for the prince.

34:14.280 --> 34:17.179
Sounds like a step in the right direction,
if you ask...

34:17.280 --> 34:19.179
We didn't ask you.

34:19.280 --> 34:22.011
I'm so sorry.
Naughty paint, naughty brush.

34:22.120 --> 34:23.326
Down, please, Samson.

34:23.920 --> 34:25.580
Haven't even got a cushion.

34:25.679 --> 34:27.179
Right, down, down. Not that...

34:27.280 --> 34:29.300
Oi! I'm on the ground.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.768
I am literally on the ground. Sorry.

34:33.280 --> 34:35.260
Actually this is
a very good angle for you.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.522
Great nostrils.
Could I have a longer brush?

34:51.120 --> 34:53.121
You don't look well, miss.

34:53.480 --> 34:54.844
Not at all.

34:55.800 --> 34:58.371
Why do you stay there,
when they treat you so?

34:59.280 --> 35:01.940
Because I made my mother
and father a promise

35:02.040 --> 35:04.540
to cherish the place we were so happy.

35:04.640 --> 35:06.529
They loved our house

35:07.800 --> 35:10.644
and now that they're gone,
I love it for them.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.260
It's my home.

35:12.360 --> 35:15.409
Hear ye! Hear ye!

35:16.160 --> 35:17.161
Quiet!

35:17.880 --> 35:18.881
"Know,

35:19.160 --> 35:22.060
"on this day, two weeks hence,

35:22.160 --> 35:24.900
"there shall be held, at the palace,

35:25.000 --> 35:26.968
"a Royal Ball.

35:27.640 --> 35:30.420
"At said ball,

35:30.520 --> 35:33.700
"in accordance with ancient custom,

35:33.800 --> 35:37.771
"the prince shall choose a bride.

35:38.520 --> 35:39.740
"Furthermore,

35:39.840 --> 35:41.900
"at the behest of the prince,

35:42.000 --> 35:46.260
"it is hereby declared
that every maiden in the kingdom,

35:46.360 --> 35:49.364
"be she noble or commoner,

35:50.600 --> 35:52.807
"is invited to attend.

35:54.440 --> 36:00.163
"Such is the command
of our most noble king."

36:01.520 --> 36:03.060
Excuse me, madam.

36:03.160 --> 36:07.722
<i>Ella was enormously excited
to see Kit, the apprentice.</i>

36:08.640 --> 36:10.980
<i>And her stepsisters
were mildly intrigued</i>

36:11.080 --> 36:13.048
<i>by the notion of meeting the prince.</i>

36:14.320 --> 36:16.860
I shall trick him into loving me.
See if I don't!

36:16.960 --> 36:19.122
This is the most hugest news!

36:19.880 --> 36:21.564
Calm yourselves.

36:22.120 --> 36:23.460
Now listen to me.

36:23.560 --> 36:25.620
One of you must win
the heart of the prince.

36:25.720 --> 36:28.300
Do that, and we can unwind the debt
in which we were ensnared

36:28.400 --> 36:29.845
when we came to this backwater!

36:30.240 --> 36:32.060
I, a princess?

36:32.160 --> 36:33.220
Or rather, I,

36:33.320 --> 36:35.288
a princess?

36:36.520 --> 36:39.900
Having delivered your news,
why are you still here?

36:40.000 --> 36:41.700
You must return to town right away

36:41.800 --> 36:44.849
and tell that seamstress
to run us up three fine ball gowns.

36:45.320 --> 36:46.401
Three?

36:47.600 --> 36:49.409
That's very thoughtful of you.

36:49.920 --> 36:51.140
What do you mean?

36:51.240 --> 36:52.820
To think of me.

36:52.920 --> 36:54.020
Think of you?

36:54.120 --> 36:56.500
Mummy, she believes
the other dress is for her.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.762
Poor, slow, little Cinders.
How embarrassing.

36:59.760 --> 37:01.580
You're too ambitious for your own good.

37:01.680 --> 37:04.570
No. I only want to see my friend.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.964
Let me be very clear.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.820
One gown for Anastasia,

37:09.920 --> 37:11.340
one for Drisella,

37:11.440 --> 37:13.283
and one for me!

37:15.360 --> 37:17.203
She doesn't know what that means.

37:24.120 --> 37:26.700
Good. Right. That's settled then.

37:26.800 --> 37:27.940
Now go!

37:28.040 --> 37:30.260
Every girl in the kingdom
will be chasing the prince.

37:30.360 --> 37:34.180
You must get there first before
the seamstress is drowning in work!

37:34.280 --> 37:35.580
Tell me what she said, Drisella.

37:35.680 --> 37:37.648
I speak French, not Italian!

37:55.320 --> 37:57.260
Wake up, Your Royal Highness.
You're in a daze.

37:57.360 --> 37:58.500
I'm sorry.

37:58.600 --> 37:59.700
You've been off since the hunt.

37:59.800 --> 38:02.724
It's that wonderful girl.
I can't stop thinking about her.

38:02.840 --> 38:04.300
But there are plenty of girls.

38:04.400 --> 38:06.900
But her spirit, her goodness...

38:07.000 --> 38:08.380
You don't suppose
she has a sister, do you?

38:08.480 --> 38:09.740
I don't know.

38:09.840 --> 38:11.580
I don't know anything about her.

38:11.680 --> 38:15.048
Perhaps your mystery girl
may come to the ball.

38:15.880 --> 38:18.060
That is why you threw
the doors open, is it not?

38:18.160 --> 38:20.500
Captain. It was for the benefit
of the people.

38:20.600 --> 38:22.660
Of course. How shallow of me.

38:22.760 --> 38:24.380
And if she comes, then what?

38:24.480 --> 38:26.060
Then you will tell her you're a prince.

38:26.160 --> 38:28.740
And a prince may take
whichever bride he wishes.

38:28.840 --> 38:29.900
- Ha!
- Ha?

38:30.000 --> 38:31.001
Yes, "ha."

38:31.120 --> 38:34.260
You know my father and the Grand Duke
will only have me marry a princess.

38:34.360 --> 38:37.887
Well, if this girl from the forest
is as charming as you say,

38:38.000 --> 38:39.240
they may change their minds.

38:42.960 --> 38:45.100
<i>The day of the ball arrived</i>

38:45.200 --> 38:49.285
<i>and the entire kingdom
held its breath in anticipation.</i>

38:49.920 --> 38:51.331
<i>You want me to be your queen?</i>

38:51.520 --> 38:52.931
Who? Me?

38:54.200 --> 38:55.326
Tighter.

38:56.320 --> 38:57.685
Tighter!

38:58.360 --> 38:59.361
Tighter.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.331
That's it!

39:01.440 --> 39:03.100
A vision, sister.

39:03.200 --> 39:04.460
Likewise.

39:04.560 --> 39:06.340
We must compete for the prince's hand.

39:06.440 --> 39:09.020
But let it not mean we harbor
dark thoughts against each other.

39:09.120 --> 39:10.690
Of course not, dear sister.

39:11.560 --> 39:15.100
I wouldn't dream of poisoning you
before we leave for the ball.

39:15.200 --> 39:17.820
Nor I of pushing you from
a moving carriage on the way there.

39:17.920 --> 39:22.300
Or I of dashing your brains out
on the palace steps as we arrive.

39:22.400 --> 39:24.060
We are sisters, after all.

39:24.160 --> 39:26.980
And blood is so much thicker than water.

39:27.080 --> 39:28.900
We shall let the prince decide.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.729
What will he be like, I wonder?

39:32.440 --> 39:34.300
What does it matter what he's like?

39:34.400 --> 39:36.050
He's rich beyond reason.

39:37.520 --> 39:40.460
Wouldn't you like to know
a bit about him before you marry him?

39:40.560 --> 39:42.940
Certainly not. It might change my mind.

39:43.040 --> 39:45.860
I bet you have never
ever spoken to a man.

39:45.960 --> 39:47.883
Have you, moon-face?

39:48.320 --> 39:50.180
I have, once.

39:50.280 --> 39:51.361
To a gentleman.

39:52.080 --> 39:53.730
Some menial, no doubt.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.340
Some 'prentice.

39:55.440 --> 39:56.820
He was an apprentice, yes.

39:56.920 --> 39:59.180
All men are fools,
that's what Mama says.

39:59.280 --> 40:00.884
The sooner you learn that, the better.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.287
The first dance, milady?

40:03.680 --> 40:06.047
Prince Charming, you're so naughty!

40:13.000 --> 40:14.740
- I want to try it.
- No, I'm wearing it.

40:14.840 --> 40:16.205
No! No!

40:19.800 --> 40:21.020
<i>Not for the first time,</i>

40:21.120 --> 40:24.380
<i>Ella actually felt pity
for these two schemers,</i>

40:24.480 --> 40:29.327
<i>who could be every bit as ugly within
as they were fair without.</i>

40:29.840 --> 40:30.860
My prince!

40:30.960 --> 40:31.900
He will love me!

40:32.000 --> 40:33.968
But I will be his queen!

40:37.080 --> 40:40.260
<i>If her stepmother
would not have a fourth dress made,</i>

40:40.360 --> 40:43.100
<i>it seemed to Ella
that there was no reason why</i>

40:43.200 --> 40:45.806
<i>she would not try to run it up herself.</i>

40:47.960 --> 40:50.850
<i>And besides, she did have a little help.</i>

41:09.680 --> 41:12.047
My dear girls.

41:12.640 --> 41:14.005
To see you like this,

41:16.080 --> 41:20.300
it makes me believe
one of you might just snare the prince.

41:20.400 --> 41:23.847
And to think
I have two horses in the race!

41:24.680 --> 41:28.924
I daresay no one in the kingdom
will outshine my daughters.

41:32.480 --> 41:33.780
Cinderella?

41:33.880 --> 41:35.609
It cost you nothing.

41:36.040 --> 41:38.380
It was my mother's old dress, you see.

41:38.480 --> 41:39.925
And I took it up myself.

41:40.920 --> 41:42.580
Cinderella at the ball!

41:42.680 --> 41:44.620
No one wants a servant for a bride.

41:44.720 --> 41:46.220
After all I've done...

41:46.320 --> 41:49.100
I don't want to ruin anything.
I don't even want to meet the prince.

41:49.200 --> 41:52.170
And you won't, because
there's no question of your going.

41:52.280 --> 41:55.620
But, all of the maidens
of the land are invited,

41:55.720 --> 41:57.500
by order of the king.

41:57.600 --> 42:00.220
It is the king I am thinking of.

42:00.320 --> 42:02.460
It would be an insult
to the royal personage

42:02.560 --> 42:05.780
to take you to the palace
dressed in these old rags.

42:05.880 --> 42:07.166
Rags?

42:07.760 --> 42:09.250
This was my mother's.

42:10.480 --> 42:13.643
I'm sorry to have to tell you

42:13.760 --> 42:16.650
but your mother's taste
was questionable.

42:16.760 --> 42:19.969
This thing is so old-fashioned

42:20.280 --> 42:22.760
it's practically falling to pieces.

42:24.240 --> 42:25.300
The shoulder's frayed.

42:25.400 --> 42:27.767
- It's falling to bits.
- And this!

42:28.080 --> 42:30.082
It's a ridiculous, old-fashioned joke!

42:33.080 --> 42:34.605
How could you?

42:34.880 --> 42:36.086
How could I otherwise?

42:36.440 --> 42:40.340
I will not have anyone
associate my daughters with you.

42:40.440 --> 42:41.660
It would ruin their prospects

42:41.760 --> 42:44.491
to be seen arriving
with a ragged servant girl.

42:44.800 --> 42:47.660
Because that is what you are.

42:47.760 --> 42:49.940
And that is what you will always be.

42:50.040 --> 42:51.940
Now mark my words!

42:52.040 --> 42:54.520
You shall not go to the ball!

42:54.880 --> 42:56.450
Go on, get going!

43:26.160 --> 43:27.810
I'm sorry, Mother.

43:30.640 --> 43:32.005
I'm sorry.

43:33.200 --> 43:35.900
I said I'd have courage, but I don't.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.490
Not anymore.

43:38.840 --> 43:40.683
I don't believe anymore.

43:59.320 --> 44:00.401
Excuse me.

44:01.840 --> 44:03.700
Can you help me, miss?

44:03.800 --> 44:08.089
Just a little crust of bread,
or better, a cup of milk?

44:08.360 --> 44:09.521
Yes.

44:10.360 --> 44:13.762
Yes, yes, yes.
I think I can find something for you.

44:22.080 --> 44:23.460
Why are you crying?

44:23.560 --> 44:25.050
It's nothing.

44:28.880 --> 44:30.620
Nothing?

44:30.720 --> 44:31.700
Nothing.

44:31.800 --> 44:34.246
What is a bowl of milk? Nothing.

44:35.560 --> 44:37.767
But kindness makes it everything.

44:48.680 --> 44:52.685
Now, I don't mean to hurry you,
but you really haven't got long, Ella.

44:53.200 --> 44:54.929
How do you know me?

44:55.760 --> 44:56.761
Who are you?

44:56.920 --> 44:58.160
Who am I?

44:58.360 --> 45:00.408
I should think
you'd have worked that one out.

45:02.400 --> 45:04.100
I'm your hairy dogfather.

45:04.200 --> 45:06.089
I mean, fairy godmother!

45:07.760 --> 45:08.921
You can't be.

45:09.320 --> 45:10.401
Why not?

45:10.720 --> 45:12.484
They don't exist.

45:13.240 --> 45:15.460
They're just made up for children.

45:15.560 --> 45:17.900
Didn't your own mother believe in them?

45:18.000 --> 45:19.161
Don't say no, because I heard her.

45:19.920 --> 45:20.921
You heard her?

45:21.280 --> 45:23.123
Fiddle-faddle, fiddle-faddle.

45:23.240 --> 45:25.447
Right! First things first.

45:26.160 --> 45:28.640
Let me slip into something
more comfortable.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.001
That's better.

45:48.680 --> 45:50.648
Now, where was I?

45:50.800 --> 45:51.860
How did you...

45:51.960 --> 45:54.060
Yes. Let's see.

45:54.160 --> 45:57.960
What we need is something
that sort of says, "coach."

46:00.480 --> 46:01.641
That trough?

46:02.160 --> 46:03.650
Doesn't really say "coach."

46:04.680 --> 46:07.081
No, no, I'm liking fruit and veg.

46:07.200 --> 46:08.580
Do you grow watermelons?

46:08.680 --> 46:09.660
No.

46:09.760 --> 46:10.740
Cantaloupe?

46:10.840 --> 46:11.900
I don't even know what that is.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.260
Artichoke?

46:13.360 --> 46:14.500
Kumquat?

46:14.600 --> 46:15.726
Beef tomato?

46:16.480 --> 46:18.482
We do have pumpkins.

46:21.520 --> 46:22.580
Pumpkins?

46:22.680 --> 46:24.060
This will be a first for me.

46:24.160 --> 46:25.321
Always interesting.

46:26.320 --> 46:27.860
I don't usually work with squashes.

46:27.960 --> 46:29.007
Too mushy.

46:32.040 --> 46:34.930
Let me see. That'll do. Yes. Knife?

46:36.160 --> 46:38.606
- There you are.
- Thank you, darling.

46:39.440 --> 46:41.660
Hello, my strangely orange
vegetable friend.

46:41.760 --> 46:42.807
A quick snip for you.

46:43.680 --> 46:44.660
Lovely!

46:44.760 --> 46:46.171
Heavy pumpkin!

46:46.840 --> 46:48.285
Look out, mices!

46:50.680 --> 46:51.740
Well. Never mind.

46:51.840 --> 46:52.900
Let's do it here.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.180
Do what here?

46:54.280 --> 46:55.930
Turn the pumpkin into a carriage.

46:58.200 --> 46:59.220
You're making me nervous, actually.

46:59.320 --> 47:01.209
- Shall I shut my eyes?
- It might be better.

47:03.520 --> 47:05.010
For heaven's sake. Let's just go for it.

47:09.480 --> 47:11.260
Well, something's definitely happening.

47:11.360 --> 47:12.725
You see, the trick is...

47:13.200 --> 47:15.362
Actually, I've forgotten
what the trick is.

47:17.720 --> 47:19.620
I just thought, if it...

47:19.720 --> 47:21.460
If it does get much bigger...

47:21.560 --> 47:22.607
Yes?

47:23.480 --> 47:24.527
Hang on.

47:28.760 --> 47:30.125
Is that what you meant to do?

47:30.240 --> 47:32.180
Do you think that's what I meant to do?

47:32.280 --> 47:33.281
Run! Run, darling!

47:40.560 --> 47:41.721
Take cover!

48:01.280 --> 48:04.250
There! One carriage.

48:04.880 --> 48:07.645
You really are my fairy godmother.

48:07.760 --> 48:08.780
Of course.

48:08.880 --> 48:11.247
I don't go about transforming
pumpkins for just anybody.

48:12.120 --> 48:14.043
Now, where are those mice?

48:14.240 --> 48:15.924
- Mice?
- Yes.

48:16.120 --> 48:17.451
Mice, mice, mice.

48:17.560 --> 48:18.580
There they are.

48:18.680 --> 48:20.444
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

48:31.760 --> 48:33.603
Four white chargers.

48:33.720 --> 48:35.882
Gus-Gus, how fine you look!

48:36.000 --> 48:37.650
But how did you...

48:37.800 --> 48:39.060
Now, where are we?

48:39.160 --> 48:42.721
Got carriage, horses... Footmen!

48:43.560 --> 48:44.561
Footmen?

48:45.640 --> 48:47.380
Hello, lovely Mr. Lizard.

48:47.480 --> 48:48.925
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

48:52.880 --> 48:54.564
Hello!

48:59.320 --> 49:00.810
You called?

49:03.600 --> 49:05.060
Now, I need that coachman.

49:05.160 --> 49:06.380
Coachman?

49:06.480 --> 49:08.369
Did I say "coachman"? I meant "goose."

49:15.440 --> 49:17.408
I can't drive. I'm a goose.

49:19.440 --> 49:20.885
Now, shoo!

49:21.280 --> 49:23.965
Everyone into place, no time to be lost!

49:24.520 --> 49:26.045
Come on!

49:28.280 --> 49:29.361
Fairy Godmother!

49:30.120 --> 49:31.360
Yes, what?

49:32.160 --> 49:33.491
My dress.

49:33.840 --> 49:35.330
I can't go in this dress.

49:35.480 --> 49:37.084
- Can you mend it?
- Mend it?

49:37.200 --> 49:38.780
No, no. I'll turn it into something new.

49:38.880 --> 49:40.740
No, please don't.

49:40.840 --> 49:42.808
This was my mother's.

49:44.040 --> 49:46.361
And I'd like to wear it
when I go to the palace.

49:48.240 --> 49:50.527
It's almost like taking her with me.

49:50.880 --> 49:52.211
I understand.

49:54.160 --> 49:57.050
But she wouldn't mind
if I gee it up a bit?

49:57.320 --> 49:59.049
Wouldn't mind a nice blue?

49:59.200 --> 50:00.406
No.

50:42.240 --> 50:43.241
There.

50:43.600 --> 50:45.409
It's beautiful.

50:45.760 --> 50:47.205
She'd love it.

50:48.240 --> 50:50.447
Now, come on. Off you go. Quick!

50:50.600 --> 50:51.931
You'll be late!

50:53.560 --> 50:56.131
I'm very new at this!

50:56.320 --> 50:57.606
Oh, boy.

50:58.800 --> 51:00.928
Stop that blooming coach!

51:07.760 --> 51:09.125
Thank you.

51:09.680 --> 51:10.761
Just a moment!

51:12.560 --> 51:14.085
Are those the best you have?

51:14.640 --> 51:16.290
It's all right. No one will see them.

51:16.440 --> 51:18.204
No, they'll ruin the whole look.
Quick, quick.

51:18.480 --> 51:20.500
Take them off. Really quite hideous.

51:20.600 --> 51:22.860
Let's have something new for a change.

51:22.960 --> 51:24.041
I'm rather good at shoes.

51:34.480 --> 51:35.641
But...

51:36.600 --> 51:38.682
They're made of glass?

51:38.840 --> 51:40.001
Yes.

51:40.520 --> 51:42.443
And you'll find
they're really comfortable.

51:42.800 --> 51:44.643
Ella, you really must go now.

51:45.520 --> 51:46.580
Fairy Godmother?

51:46.680 --> 51:48.011
What is it?

51:48.160 --> 51:49.380
My stepmother and the girls?

51:49.480 --> 51:50.620
Don't worry.

51:50.720 --> 51:53.485
I'll make sure they don't recognize you.

51:54.480 --> 51:55.561
Now, off you go.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.207
For you shall go to the ball.

52:01.520 --> 52:03.568
In you get. So lovely.

52:03.680 --> 52:05.170
Do stop wittering on.

52:09.720 --> 52:10.700
Ella!

52:10.800 --> 52:11.900
I almost forgot.

52:12.000 --> 52:15.420
Remember, the magic
will only last so long.

52:15.520 --> 52:17.820
With the last echo of the last bell,

52:17.920 --> 52:19.660
at the last stroke of midnight,

52:19.760 --> 52:21.900
the spell will be broken

52:22.000 --> 52:24.401
and all will return
to what it was before.

52:24.960 --> 52:26.060
Midnight?

52:26.160 --> 52:27.286
Midnight.

52:27.520 --> 52:29.409
That's more than enough time.

52:30.280 --> 52:31.884
- Off you go then.
- Thank you.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.047
Thank you.

52:34.080 --> 52:36.208
Goosey, go!

52:38.840 --> 52:40.001
Goodbye!

53:34.760 --> 53:37.206
Chandeliers, aloft!

53:50.320 --> 53:53.085
Princess Mei Mei of Fujian.

53:55.560 --> 53:59.060
Princess Shahrzad of the Seljuqs.

53:59.160 --> 54:00.571
Your Highness!

54:02.200 --> 54:05.249
Princess Chelina of Zaragosa!

54:06.040 --> 54:09.487
Princess Imani of Shona!

54:12.440 --> 54:16.331
Princess Hiina
of the Chrysanthemum Throne!

54:21.360 --> 54:23.488
Lady Tremaine and her daughters.

54:26.600 --> 54:30.047
The Lady Tremaine and her daughters.

54:30.160 --> 54:31.140
I'm Drisella.

54:31.240 --> 54:32.220
And I'm Anastasia.

54:32.320 --> 54:33.540
- People will want to know.
- I'm the clever one.

54:33.640 --> 54:35.165
I'm very beautiful.

54:35.480 --> 54:38.660
The very clever Miss Drisella,

54:38.760 --> 54:42.082
and the very beautiful Anastasia.

54:42.600 --> 54:44.443
Do come on!

54:49.760 --> 54:51.489
The Lord Veneering.

54:52.680 --> 54:54.648
Who are you looking for?

54:56.080 --> 54:57.241
No one.

54:58.160 --> 55:00.540
It's that girl in the forest, isn't it?

55:00.640 --> 55:03.620
That's why you were so generous
with the invitations.

55:03.720 --> 55:05.210
Father, it was for the people.

55:05.320 --> 55:07.891
I know you love the people, Kit.

55:08.920 --> 55:12.300
But I also know
that your head's been turned.

55:12.400 --> 55:16.100
But you've only met her once,
in the forest.

55:16.200 --> 55:19.020
And you would have me
marry someone I met once, tonight.

55:19.120 --> 55:20.620
A princess.

55:20.720 --> 55:23.121
It's a princess or nothing.

55:28.720 --> 55:30.484
Hold the doors! One more coming in.

55:42.560 --> 55:44.580
May I present Her Royal Highness,

55:44.680 --> 55:47.763
the Princess Chelina of Zaragosa.

55:52.720 --> 55:54.643
You are as handsome as your picture.

55:55.320 --> 55:57.891
And your little kingdom is enchanting.

55:59.080 --> 56:03.244
I hope the princess will not find
our "little kingdom" too confining.

56:08.760 --> 56:10.250
Miss Ella.

56:10.800 --> 56:12.290
Thank you.

56:24.920 --> 56:26.649
I'm frightened, Mr. Lizard.

56:28.840 --> 56:32.003
I'm only a girl, not a princess.

56:32.440 --> 56:35.410
And I'm only a lizard, not a footman.

56:36.680 --> 56:38.489
Enjoy it while it lasts.

57:02.560 --> 57:04.881
Your Majesty, Your Royal Highness,

57:06.400 --> 57:08.368
My Lords, ladies and gentlemen,

57:09.000 --> 57:13.324
distinguished visitors
and people of our land,

57:13.480 --> 57:18.088
the prince shall now choose his partner
for the first dance.

57:18.360 --> 57:21.921
Let our ball commence!

57:53.440 --> 57:55.204
Excuse me.

57:56.080 --> 57:58.380
A thousand apologies,
Your Royal Highness.

57:58.480 --> 58:00.005
I don't know what happened.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.525
Mr. Kit.

59:09.000 --> 59:10.490
It's you,

59:11.720 --> 59:12.767
isn't it?

59:13.360 --> 59:15.283
Just so.

59:17.080 --> 59:19.003
Your Highness...

59:21.320 --> 59:22.460
If I may,

59:22.560 --> 59:23.925
that is,

59:26.360 --> 59:29.180
it would give me the greatest pleasure,

59:29.280 --> 59:32.860
if you would do me the honor
of letting me lead you through this...

59:32.960 --> 59:34.200
the first...

59:37.960 --> 59:39.325
Dance?

59:39.800 --> 59:41.245
Yes, dance.

59:42.280 --> 59:43.611
That's it.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.369
They're all looking at you.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:11.684
Believe me, they're all looking at you.

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:22.609
Who is she?

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.285
I have no idea.

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.566
Who's that, Mama?

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:31.180
I'm not exactly sure,
but this does not bode well.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.700
That's a lovely dress she's got on.

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.540
- And how pretty she is.
- Concentrate!

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:37.540
You must turn the prince's head,
you fools! Now, get out there!

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:38.900
But no one's asked us to dance.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.020
Gentlemen.

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:41.281
May I present my daughters,

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:43.380
- Anastasia, Drisella.
- <i>Mademoiselle.</i>

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:45.369
Off you go!

01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.571
Smile.

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:08.161
Come with me.

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:10.482
Over there. Smile.

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:17.170
So, you're the prince!

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:21.460
Not "the prince," exactly.

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:24.006
There are plenty of princes
in the world. I'm only a prince.

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:27.020
But your name's not really Kit.

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:29.180
Certainly it is,
and my father still calls me that,

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.820
when he's especially un-peeved at me.

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.260
But you're no apprentice.

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:35.820
I am. An apprentice monarch.

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:37.445
Still learning my trade.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.540
Oh, gosh!

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.420
Look, please forgive me.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.580
I thought you might treat me
differently if you knew.

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:45.940
I mistook you
for a good, honest country girl,

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:49.300
and now I see you didn't want
to overawe a plain soldier.

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.100
Little chance of that.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.884
No more surprises?

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.565
No more surprises.

01:03:58.560 --> 01:03:59.891
Is that you?

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:02.327
I hate myself in paintings. Don't you?

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.940
No one's ever painted my portrait.

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.566
No? Well, they should.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:11.820
Who is she?

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:13.140
She gave no name, Your Grace.

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:14.220
You didn't ask?

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.300
I was out of breath, Your Grace,
on account of introducing

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:18.460
Princess Blodwyn
of Llanfairpwllgwyngyll...

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.722
- Shut up, will you?
- "Shut up." Absolutely.

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:27.003
I don't believe this!

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:30.564
No! Not her!

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.323
Won't they miss you at the ball?

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:39.806
Maybe.

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.129
But let's not go back just yet.

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.251
What's wrong?

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:49.900
When I go back,

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.180
they will try to pair me off
with a lady of their choosing.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.806
I'm expected to marry for advantage.

01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:57.740
Well, whose advantage?

01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.683
That is a good question.

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:04.500
Well, surely you have a right
to your own heart.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:07.180
And I must weigh that
against the king's wishes.

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:11.126
He's a wise ruler and a loving father.

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:14.690
Well, perhaps he'll change his mind.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:22.006
I fear he hasn't much time to do so.

01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:25.324
Poor Kit.

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.860
People are saying she's a princess.

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:32.380
Our prince seems quite taken with her.

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.209
She went straight for him.

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.740
You have to appreciate her efficiency.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:40.731
But surely, if she is a princess,
this may be good.

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:46.450
I've already promised him in marriage,
to the Princess Chelina.

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:48.326
But...

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:52.649
Forgive me, Your Grace.

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:55.081
I did not mean to intrude.

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:59.082
No, it's you who have
to forgive me, madam.

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.888
Your secret is safe with me.

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:16.922
I've never shown this place to anyone.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.043
A secret garden.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:29.965
I love it!

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.521
Please.

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:40.780
No, I shouldn't.

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:41.927
You should.

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.441
- I shouldn't.
- You should.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:45.806
I will.

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:56.561
May I?

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:57.926
Please.

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:26.845
It's made of glass.

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.090
And why not?

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:30.601
Allow me.

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:32.609
Thank you.

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:45.081
There.

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:46.841
There.

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:54.285
Won't you tell me who you really are?

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:57.649
If I do, I think
everything might be different.

01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:00.964
I don't understand.
Can you at least tell me your name?

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:03.211
My name is...

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:10.210
I have to leave.

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:12.165
It's hard to explain.

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:15.968
Lizards and pumpkins, and things.

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.120
Wait!

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:23.041
Where are you going?

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:25.483
You've been awfully nice.

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.688
Thank you for a wonderful evening.
I've loved it.

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:29.006
Every second!

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.845
"Lizards and pumpkins."

01:09:00.359 --> 01:09:01.566
Excuse me.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:03.721
Sorry! Terribly sorry.

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.281
My goodness!

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:09.404
My prince!

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:13.684
You've got the wrong one!

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:15.441
He needs her name!

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:16.560
I know he needs her name.

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:18.580
Her name, you ninny. Get her name!

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.444
That really hurt!

01:09:21.439 --> 01:09:22.420
Your Majesty.

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.660
Young lady.

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:24.779
I am so sorry.

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:26.370
Think nothing of it, my dear.

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.644
I wanted to say, Your Majesty,

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:33.279
your son Kit is the most lovely
person I ever met.

01:09:33.479 --> 01:09:35.243
So good and brave.

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:38.127
I hope you know how much he loves you.

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:40.725
Excuse me!

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.405
Wait!

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:07.764
Wait!

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.201
Where are you going?

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:10.606
Hurry, hurry!

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:14.924
Come back!

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:18.081
Hurry!

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:22.641
Hurry, please, Mr. Goose!

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:25.931
Wait!

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.602
Watch out!

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:38.361
Captain, my horse.

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:39.521
No!

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:42.604
This may be some intrigue
to lure you from the palace.

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.689
Your father needs you here.

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:47.006
Captain!

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:48.525
I was having a fine old time.

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:51.007
You had to go and choose that one,
didn't you?

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.529
Yes, I did.

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:21.926
Hurry, Mr. Goose!

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:23.286
Come on!

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:26.900
Hee-ya!

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.684
Be careful, Mr. Goose!

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:34.241
Oh, my goodness!

01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:46.047
You there! Stop in the name of the king!

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:49.090
Such bad timing.

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.260
Halt there!

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:55.521
I know what to do!

01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:58.161
Yes!

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:00.520
Get this thing open!

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:06.881
Oh, dear!

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:18.846
No, no, no.

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:34.126
I'm sorry.

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:37.805
You'll find it's very comfortable.

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:05.089
Do shut up!

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:08.481
Cinderella!

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:11.484
Cinderella! We'll have to wake her up.

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:13.845
Cinderella!

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.809
Wake up, lazy bones!

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:17.900
Tea and a plate of biscuits.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.220
Welcome back!

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:21.288
- You look cheerful!
- And wet!

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.060
I took a walk in the rain
to cheer myself up.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:25.140
Typical.

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:26.287
Tea.

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:28.860
We did not communicate
through mere words.

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:30.060
Our souls met.

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:32.766
Precisely. My soul
and the prince's soul.

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:34.365
Your soul was over
by the banquet tables.

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:36.204
You didn't see him dance with me.

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:39.648
Dance with you?
He didn't even speak to you.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:42.121
It was not our fault, Mother.
It was that girl.

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:43.691
The mystery princess.

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:45.524
Mystery princess?

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.684
My, what a charming notion.

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:49.365
She was no princess.

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:52.683
She was a preening interloper
who made a spectacle of herself.

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.128
A vulgar, young hussy
marched into the ball,

01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:58.522
unaccompanied, if you will,

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:01.007
and to the horror of everyone,
threw herself at the prince.

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:03.482
And he actually danced
with the ugly thing.

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:04.660
- Yes?
- Yes.

01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:05.780
It was pity.

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:08.690
He was too polite to send her packing
in front of everyone, you see.

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:12.740
But not wanting to expose us
to the presumptuous wench any further,

01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:14.460
- he took her apart.
- And told her off.

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:15.940
But she refused to leave

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:19.044
and the palace guards
chased her from the party!

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:21.780
I pity the prince. Such bad taste.

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:23.380
They belong with each other.

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:24.970
Well, it's no matter, girls.

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:27.500
The ball was a mere diversion.

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:29.364
The prince is not free
to marry for love.

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:33.482
He's promised to the
Princess Chelina of Zaragosa.

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:36.208
The Grand Duke told me himself.

01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:38.328
It's so very unfair.

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:40.330
Yes.

01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:43.081
The way of the world.

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:49.762
Hello again.

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:02.445
Thank you for your help.

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:05.283
It really was like a dream.

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:07.762
Better than a dream.

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:27.340
<i>Ella couldn't wait to write down
all that had happened,</i>

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:30.683
<i>so that she might remember
every single bit of it</i>

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:34.060
<i>just as if she were telling
her mother and father</i>

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:38.529
<i>about the palace ball
and her time with the prince.</i>

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:45.725
<i>Above all, the prince.</i>

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:11.010
You've come.

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:12.687
Good.

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:16.091
Father.

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:18.331
Don't go.

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:20.851
I must.

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.928
You needn't be alone.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.608
Take a bride.

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:29.047
The Princess Chelina.

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:32.763
What if I commanded you to do so?

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:37.763
I love and respect you, but I will not.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.164
I believe that we need not
look outside of our borders

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:46.527
for strength or guidance.

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:49.441
What we need is right before us.

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:55.525
And we need only have courage
and be kind to see it.

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.205
Just so.

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:05.247
You've become your own man.

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:06.880
Good.

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:12.209
And perhaps,
in the little time left to me,

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:15.210
I can become the father you deserve.

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:21.844
You must not marry for advantage.

01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.767
You must marry for love.

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.763
Find that girl.

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:34.771
Find her.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.526
The one they're all talking about.

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:39.180
The forgetful one

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:41.328
- who loses her shoes.
- ...loses her shoes.

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:50.127
Be cheerful, boy.

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:54.442
Thank you, Father.

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:56.882
Thank you, Kit.

01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:03.728
I love you, son.

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:07.289
I love you, Father.

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:43.340
<i>Once the time for mourning had passed,</i>

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:45.860
<i>a proclamation was sent out.</i>

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:49.567
Hear ye! Hear ye!

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:52.001
Hear ye!

01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:59.820
Know that our new king

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:03.606
hereby declares his love for

01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:08.651
the mysterious princess

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:10.321
as wore

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:13.763
glass slippers to the ball.

01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:19.165
And requests that she present herself
at the palace,

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:23.530
whereupon, if she be willing,

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:29.121
he will forthwith marry her

01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:33.966
with all due ceremony.

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:12.084
Are you looking for this?

01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:16.020
There must be quite a story
to go with it.

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:17.610
Won't you tell me?

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:19.081
No?

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.171
All right then.

01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:23.766
I shall tell you a story.

01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:26.444
Once upon a time,

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:29.285
there was a beautiful young girl

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:31.882
who married for love.

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:35.010
And she had two loving daughters.

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:37.123
All was well.

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:40.921
But, one day, her husband,

01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:43.771
the light of her life, died.

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:45.965
The next time,

01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:49.124
she married for the sake
of her daughters.

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:53.285
But that man, too, was taken from her.

01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:59.123
And she was doomed to look
every day upon his beloved child.

01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:02.180
She had hoped to marry off

01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:06.860
one of her beautiful,
stupid daughters to the prince.

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:10.806
But his head was turned
by a girl with glass slippers.

01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:12.891
And so,

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:16.920
I lived unhappily ever after.

01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:21.891
My story would appear to be ended.

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:25.404
Now, tell me yours.

01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:27.491
Did you steal it?

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:29.487
No.

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:31.300
It was given to me.

01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:32.380
Given to you?

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:34.460
Given to you. Nothing is ever given.

01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:36.483
For everything, we must pay and pay.

01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:38.091
That's not true.

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:42.124
Kindness is free. Love is free.

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:44.282
Love is not free.

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:48.740
Now, here is how you will pay me,

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:50.922
if you are to have what you desire.

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:56.762
No one will believe you,
a dirty servant girl without a family,

01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:59.287
if you lay claim to the prince's heart.

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:02.011
But with a respectable gentlewoman
to put you forward,

01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:03.690
you will not be ignored.

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:05.420
When you are married,

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:09.180
you will make me
the head of the royal household.

01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:12.420
Anastasia and Drisella
we will pair off with wealthy lords.

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:15.683
And I shall manage that boy.

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:18.049
But he's not a boy.

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:20.370
And who are you?

01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.882
How would you rule a kingdom?

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:24.166
Best to leave it to me.

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:27.566
That way we all get what we want.

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:29.887
No.

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:35.325
No?

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:38.129
I was not able to protect
my father from you,

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:40.720
but I will protect the prince
and the kingdom,

01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:43.369
no matter what becomes of me.

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:46.882
Well, that is a mistake.

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:49.845
No!

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:51.246
Why?

01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:54.567
Why are you so cruel?

01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:57.140
I don't understand it.

01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:59.083
I've tried to be kind to you.

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:00.900
You? Kind to me?

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.140
Yes.

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:04.580
And though no one deserves to be treated

01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:06.409
as you have treated me.

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:08.730
Why do you do it?

01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:12.680
Why?

01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:18.240
Because you are young,
and innocent, and good.

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:19.925
And I...

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:27.126
No!

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:34.129
May I ask where you got this?

01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:36.931
From a ragged servant girl
in my household.

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:41.124
The mystery princess is a commoner.

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:46.285
You could imagine when I discovered
her subterfuge how horrified I was.

01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:48.566
You told no one else?

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:51.361
Not even my own daughters.

01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:54.930
No one need ever know the truth.

01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:58.641
You've spared the kingdom
a great deal of embarrassment.

01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:02.450
And I should like to keep it that way.

01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:04.404
Are you threatening me?

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:06.166
Yes.

01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:14.605
So what do you want?

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:17.482
I should like to be a countess.

01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:22.245
And I require advantageous marriages
for my two daughters.

01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:24.646
Done.

01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:28.641
And the girl?

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:32.127
Do with her what you will.

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:34.605
She's nothing to me.

01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:38.500
- Where?
- Abandoned on the side of the road.

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:39.980
- And have you found her?
- The girl?

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:41.525
No, she's disappeared.

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:43.700
There must be some reason she vanished.

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:45.700
Perhaps she has been prevented
from speaking.

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:46.900
Do not lose heart, Kit.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.844
On the contrary,
lose heart and gain wisdom.

01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:53.124
The people need to know
that the kingdom is secure.

01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:56.529
That the king has a queen,
and the land may have an heir.

01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:58.860
They want to face the future
with certainty!

01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:00.940
Agreed! Then let us be certain.

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:02.500
I am king.

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:05.260
I say we shall seek out
the mystery princess,

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:07.100
even if she does not want to be found.

01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:08.860
I have to see her again.

01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:10.724
But if she's not found,

01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:15.210
then for the good of the kingdom,
you must marry the Princess Chelina.

01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:17.406
For the good of the kingdom.

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:31.324
Very well, agreed.

01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:32.891
But Your Highness...

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:39.890
But you will spare no effort.

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:43.244
Your Majesty, of course.
You have my word.

01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:04.521
Next.

01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:12.963
<i>The slipper traveled the length
and breadth of the kingdom,</i>

01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:16.340
<i>visiting every maiden both high and low,</i>

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.727
<i>and every sort in between.</i>

01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:20.121
Oh, Lord!

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:21.340
You first, madam.

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:24.011
Well, I'll give it a go.

01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:26.566
Right. I say. Where do you want me?

01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:29.651
Up! Up I go.

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:33.006
Careful, my foot's a bit swollen.
I've been...

01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:38.082
It's the yeast.

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:41.180
<i>The Grand Duke was true to his word.</i>

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:44.980
<i>He spared no effort
to demonstrate to the prince</i>

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:47.620
<i>that the mystery princess
was not to be found.</i>

01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:48.700
It fits!

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:50.740
- It doesn't fit you.
- It does fit!

01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:52.001
- It doesn't fit.
- It's mine!

01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:54.500
- I am the mystery princess!
- Give back the shoe.

01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:55.540
Take the shoe away from her!

01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:56.820
Don't take the shoe away from me,
please, please!

01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:58.160
Please, it's my shoe!

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.650
Make way for the slipper!

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.140
Can I try the other foot?

01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:12.526
I don't think so.

01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:15.660
<i>But whatever they tried,</i>

01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:19.580
<i>the magical slipper refused to fit
even the most eligible of maidens.</i>

01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:22.331
We found the mystery princess for ya!

01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:34.284
What's wrong, Captain?

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:37.169
We haven't found the girl.

01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:39.020
I'm disappointed for our king.

01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:41.380
Come on, now! Don't lose heart.

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:43.130
There's one more house.

01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:46.206
We must leave no stone unturned.

01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:49.100
- Horses!
- Horses!

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:52.010
Mother, it's our chance!

01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:57.249
Let them in!

01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:12.940
Gentlemen! What a wonderful surprise.

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:14.900
A moment of your time, good lady.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.968
Of course, Your Grace.

01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:19.082
Please. This way.

01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:22.940
<i>Ella did not know who was downstairs.</i>

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.405
<i>Nor did she care.</i>

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:26.980
<i>For surely no one had come to see her.</i>

01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:28.241
Jacqueline, stop it!

01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:36.687
It shrunk.

01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:39.006
Try again.

01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:49.605
Enough!

01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:52.820
<i>You must love me...</i>

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:55.940
<i>Though Ella was sad,
her spirit was not broken.</i>

01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:58.008
<i>She knew that the ball,</i>

01:29:58.120 --> 01:29:59.420
<i>and her time with the prince,</i>

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:02.060
<i>would become
beautiful, distant memories,</i>

01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:04.620
<i>like those of her father and mother,</i>

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:07.007
<i>and her golden childhood.</i>

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:18.649
It fits me!

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:20.761
Bad luck, miss.

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:24.300
<i>Lavender's green dilly, dilly</i>

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:27.051
<i>Lavender's blue</i>

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:31.324
<i>You must love me dilly, dilly</i>

01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:33.482
<i>For I love you</i>

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:35.780
<i>Very well.</i>

01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:37.325
Our task is done, Captain.

01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:41.606
But fate may yet be kind to us, girls.

01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:45.060
Indeed, madam!

01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:48.060
<i>When I am king dilly, dilly</i>

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:50.367
<i>You shall be queen</i>

01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:53.460
<i>Lavender's green dilly, dilly</i>

01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:55.324
<i>Lavender's blue</i>

01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:58.928
<i>If you love me</i>

01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:00.100
<i>Dilly, dilly</i>

01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:02.680
<i>I will love you</i>

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:06.684
<i>Let the birds sing dilly, dilly</i>

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:09.451
<i>And the lambs play</i>

01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:12.845
<i>We shall be safe dilly, dilly..</i>

01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:15.884
Do you hear that, Your Grace?

01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:17.980
Let's be off, Captain.

01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:19.286
Just a moment.

01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:23.761
Madam,

01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:27.123
there is no other maiden in your house?

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:30.725
None.

01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:33.928
Then has your cat learned to sing?

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:44.140
There's been enough play-acting today,
Captain. Let's be off.

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:46.180
But she's lying, Your Grace.

01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:48.860
Nonsense! I trust the lady.
We're leaving.

01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:50.086
Grand Duke!

01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:57.442
Your Majesty.

01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:01.042
What sweet singing.
Makes me want to tarry just a little.

01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:03.500
Your Majesty, I did not know...

01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.500
Captain, would you be so kind
as to investigate?

01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:09.286
It would be my pleasure, Your Majesty.

01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:13.726
<i>If you love me dilly, dilly</i>

01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:15.569
<i>I will love you</i>

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:19.460
There! You see?

01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:21.820
I told you it was no one
of any importance.

01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:23.649
We'll see about that.

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:26.681
Miss.

01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:33.251
You are requested and required
to present yourself to your king.

01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:35.140
I forbid you to do this!

01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:37.607
And I forbid you to forbid her!

01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:40.284
Who are you to stop
an officer of the king?

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:42.370
Are you an empress?

01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:43.961
A saint?

01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:45.925
A deity?

01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:48.044
I am her mother.

01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:55.443
You have never been

01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:59.650
and you never will be my mother.

01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:05.485
Come now, miss.

01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:13.449
Just remember who you are, you wretch!

01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:32.300
<i>Would who she was,
who she really was, be enough?</i>

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:35.260
<i>There was no magic
to help her this time.</i>

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:38.900
<i>This is perhaps the greatest risk
that any of us will take.</i>

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:42.561
<i>To be seen as we truly are.</i>

01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:47.690
<i>Have courage, and be kind.</i>

01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:29.410
Who are you?

01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:33.083
I am Cinderella.

01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:37.644
Your Majesty,

01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:41.729
I'm no princess.

01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:45.043
I have no carriage,

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:47.730
no parents,

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:50.409
and no dowry.

01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:54.564
I do not even know
if that beautiful slipper will fit.

01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:56.165
But

01:34:58.080 --> 01:34:59.605
if it does,

01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:03.846
will you take me as I am?

01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:07.766
An honest country girl who loves you.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.002
Of course I will.

01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:14.323
But only if you will take me as I am.

01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:16.522
An apprentice still learning his trade.

01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:19.767
Please.

01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:06.700
Cinderella!

01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:07.961
Ella!

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:12.322
My dear sister! I'm sorry.

01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:14.289
So very sorry.

01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:32.006
Shall we?

01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:14.245
I forgive you.

01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:24.940
<i>Forgiven or not,</i>

01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:27.900
<i>Cinderella's stepmother
and her daughters</i>

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.980
<i>would soon leave with the Grand Duke,</i>

01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:33.209
<i>and never set foot in the kingdom again.</i>

01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:43.540
They would have loved each other.

01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:46.020
We must have a portrait of you painted.

01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:48.726
No. I do hate myself in paintings.

01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:49.966
Be kind.

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:52.980
And have courage.

01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:54.844
And all will be well.

01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:03.500
Are you ready?

01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:06.444
For anything, so long as it's with you.

01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:19.010
My queen.

01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:20.760
My Kit.

01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:36.600
<i>And so Kit and Ella were married,</i>

01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:39.620
<i>and I can tell you,
as her fairy godmother,</i>

01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:41.100
<i>that they were counted to be</i>

01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:46.047
<i>the fairest and kindest rulers
the kingdom had known.</i>

01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:50.620
<i>And Ella continued to see
the world not as it is,</i>

01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:52.820
<i>but as it could be,</i>

01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:55.780
<i>if only you believe in courage</i>

01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:59.180
<i>and kindness and occasionally,</i>

01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:03.285
<i>just a little bit of magic.</i>

01:39:16.915 --> 01:39:20.519
<i>In a perfect storybook</i>

01:39:20.619 --> 01:39:23.989
<i>The world is brave and good</i>

01:39:24.089 --> 01:39:26.525
<i>A hero takes your hand</i>

01:39:26.625 --> 01:39:28.627
<i>A sweet love</i>

01:39:28.727 --> 01:39:30.596
<i>Will find love</i>

01:39:30.696 --> 01:39:34.366
<i>But life's a different game</i>

01:39:34.466 --> 01:39:37.836
<i>The sorrow and the pain</i>

01:39:38.237 --> 01:39:44.410
<i>Only you can change your world tomorrow</i>

01:39:45.010 --> 01:39:51.483
<i>Let your smile light up the sky</i>

01:39:51.917 --> 01:39:58.657
<i>Keep your spirit soaring high</i>

01:40:01.127 --> 01:40:03.434
<i>Trust in your heart</i>

01:40:03.534 --> 01:40:08.033
<i>And your sun shines forever and ever</i>

01:40:08.133 --> 01:40:11.136
<i>Hold fast to kindness</i>

01:40:11.236 --> 01:40:14.940
<i>Your light shines forever and ever</i>

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:21.113
<i>I believe in you and in me</i>

01:40:21.847 --> 01:40:27.253
<i>We are strong</i>

01:40:30.122 --> 01:40:33.792
<i>When once upon a time</i>

01:40:33.892 --> 01:40:37.196
<i>In stories and in rhyme</i>

01:40:37.296 --> 01:40:40.065
<i>A moment you can shine</i>

01:40:40.165 --> 01:40:44.370
<i>And wear your own crown</i>

01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:51.076
<i>Be the one that rescues you</i>

01:40:51.176 --> 01:40:57.316
<i>Through the clouds you'll see the blue</i>

01:40:59.885 --> 01:41:02.200
<i>Trust in your heart</i>

01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:06.658
<i>And your sun shines forever and ever</i>

01:41:06.758 --> 01:41:09.662
<i>Hold fast to kindness</i>

01:41:09.762 --> 01:41:13.465
<i>Your light shines forever and ever</i>

01:41:13.565 --> 01:41:19.672
<i>I believe in you and in me</i>

01:41:20.339 --> 01:41:25.812
<i>We are strong</i>

01:41:28.347 --> 01:41:33.653
<i>A bird all alone on the wing</i>

01:41:34.786 --> 01:41:40.092
<i>Can still be strong and sing</i>

01:41:40.192 --> 01:41:41.994
<i>Sing</i>

01:41:42.094 --> 01:41:44.526
<i>Trust in your heart</i>

01:41:44.626 --> 01:41:48.867
<i>And your sun shines forever and ever</i>

01:41:48.967 --> 01:41:51.971
<i>Hold fast to kindness</i>

01:41:52.071 --> 01:41:55.774
<i>Your light shines forever and ever</i>

01:41:55.874 --> 01:42:01.880
<i>I believe in you and in me</i>

01:42:02.514 --> 01:42:07.921
<i>We are strong</i>

01:42:23.035 --> 01:42:27.873
<i>A dream is a wish your heart makes</i>

01:42:28.340 --> 01:42:32.745
<i>When you're fast asleep</i>

01:42:32.845 --> 01:42:37.649
<i>In dreams you will lose your heartaches</i>

01:42:37.749 --> 01:42:42.554
<i>Whatever you wish for you keep</i>

01:42:42.654 --> 01:42:47.426
<i>Have faith in your dreams and someday</i>

01:42:47.526 --> 01:42:52.231
<i>Your rainbow will come smiling through</i>

01:42:52.331 --> 01:42:56.201
<i>No matter how your heart is grieving</i>

01:42:56.301 --> 01:42:59.905
<i>If you keep on believing</i>

01:43:00.005 --> 01:43:06.712
<i>The dream that you wish will come true</i>

01:43:18.157 --> 01:43:22.528
<i>A dream is a wish your heart makes</i>

01:43:22.628 --> 01:43:26.298
<i>When you're fast asleep</i>

01:43:26.398 --> 01:43:30.335
<i>In dreams you will lose your heartaches</i>

01:43:30.435 --> 01:43:34.440
<i>Whatever you wish for you keep</i>

01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:38.644
<i>Have faith in your dreams and someday</i>

01:43:38.744 --> 01:43:43.282
<i>Your rainbow will come smiling through</i>

01:43:43.382 --> 01:43:48.420
<i>No matter how your heart is grieving</i>

01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:52.791
<i>If you keep on believing</i>

01:43:52.891 --> 01:43:57.529
<i>The dream that you wish</i>

01:43:57.629 --> 01:44:02.001
<i>Will come true</i>

01:44:17.949 --> 01:44:20.719
<i>- Well done, Ella.
- My turn?</i>

01:44:20.819 --> 01:44:25.291
<i>Salagadoola mechicka boola

01:44:25.391 --> 01:44:29.761
<i>Put them together and what have you got?
Bippity-boppity-boo</i>

01:44:29.861 --> 01:44:34.366
<i>Salagadoola mechicka boola
Bippity-boppity-boo</i>

01:44:34.466 --> 01:44:39.838
<i>It'll do magic, believe it or not
Bippity-boppity-boo</i>

01:44:39.938 --> 01:44:44.210
<i>Now, Salagadoola means
Mechicka booleroo</i>

01:44:44.310 --> 01:44:48.948
<i>But the thingamabob that does the job
is Bippity-boppity-boo</i>

01:44:49.048 --> 01:44:53.485
<i>Salagadoola mechicka boola
