We lost the entire escort

What kind of rebel ship

That was no transport.

08:17.096 --> 08:19.431
Ah, but you are wrong, cadet.

08:19.433 --> 08:21.366
It was a transport
called the <i> Ghost,</i>

08:21.368 --> 08:23.535
which has been modified
for combat.

08:23.537 --> 08:26.338
The rebels
are a desperate group
of extremists.

08:26.340 --> 08:28.006
They'll fight
with any ship,

08:28.008 --> 08:31.109
using any means necessary
to undermine our authority.

08:31.111 --> 08:34.546

followed without question.

08:34.548 --> 08:36.448
Insubordination
like yours

08:36.450 --> 08:38.717
will get you
and your wingman killed.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.785
Understood?
Yes, sir.

08:43.890 --> 08:46.091
Understood, cadet?

08:46.893 --> 08:47.959
Yes, sir.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.735
I see you don't
just take risks
when you're flying.

08:56.737 --> 08:59.971
Well, I trust my gut,
and I know right from wrong.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.974
I respect that.
A lot of people here won't.

09:19.992 --> 09:22.527
Governor Pryce, Agent Kallus.

09:22.529 --> 09:25.397
May I ask the reason
for this unscheduled visit?

09:25.399 --> 09:28.099
ISB has information
that some of your cadets

09:28.101 --> 09:30.902
are planning to defect
to the rebels.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.071
You have traitors
in your midst.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.539
Impossible.

09:34.541 --> 09:38.043
My cadets are unmatched,
both in their skill
and loyalty.

09:38.045 --> 09:42.180
Nevertheless,
I will be conducting
a thorough investigation,

09:42.182 --> 09:45.417
and you are to extend
your full cooperation.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.087
Agent Kallus,
you may begin.

09:49.089 --> 09:52.424
My hope is that
I may teach you
something today.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.298
I told you
it was too risky.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.100
How are we gonna
get out of this?

10:02.102 --> 10:04.536
Will you just relax?
They don't know.

10:04.538 --> 10:06.805
If they did,
we'd be in the brig.

10:14.213 --> 10:16.114
Something wrong, Wedge?

10:16.116 --> 10:18.116
Uh, no. Why?

10:18.118 --> 10:20.218
You just look nervous.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.154
Uh, actually, I've been
thinking about what you said
in the simulator today.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.056
About how this wasn't
what you signed up for.

10:25.058 --> 10:28.059
Look, I want to do my part
for the Empire,

10:28.061 --> 10:31.129
but firing on unarmed ships
wasn't what I had in mind.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.731
What about you?

10:32.733 --> 10:35.333
I was flying cargo ships
when the Empire recruited me.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.902
At the time,
I figured, why not?

10:37.904 --> 10:41.239
Seemed a whole lot
more exciting than hauling
spare parts around the galaxy.

10:41.241 --> 10:45.076
But if this is
what the Empire's becoming,
I don't know.

10:45.078 --> 10:47.412
Hmm. You ever think
about getting out?

10:47.414 --> 10:50.582
That's not really
possible, is it?

10:50.584 --> 10:53.084
Maybe more possible
than you realize.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.953
What are you
talking about?

10:54.955 --> 10:56.988
My real name
is Sabine Wren.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.357
I was sent in
to get you out.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.259
So the Rebellion did
get my message.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.962
Yes. But I heard there were
other pilots who want out too.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.697
There are.

11:05.699 --> 11:09.134
Okay, we need to leave now,
before the Empire closes in.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.502
Can you get them ready?

11:10.504 --> 11:12.671
I'll talk to them.
What's your plan?

11:12.673 --> 11:14.873
Well, I'll tell you
when I figure that out.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.041
Are you serious?

11:16.043 --> 11:18.109
Welcome to the Rebellion.

11:23.115 --> 11:25.617
Ezra, you need
to calm down.

11:25.619 --> 11:27.152
How can I be calm, huh?

11:27.154 --> 11:29.454
Sabine's stuck over there,
and there's nothing I can do.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.990
That's right.
There's nothing you can do.

11:31.992 --> 11:34.959
So nothing
you are doing right now
is going to help.

11:34.961 --> 11:37.395
Sit down.

11:37.397 --> 11:40.999
Ezra, part of a Jedi's wisdom
comes from learning to accept

11:41.001 --> 11:44.002
when a situation
is out of our control.

11:44.004 --> 11:46.671
Do you trust her?
Of course I trust her.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.907
Good. Then trust
she'll succeed.

11:56.515 --> 11:59.250
My investigation
is nearly complete,
Governor.

11:59.252 --> 12:02.220
I have found nothing
as of yet.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.488
Then perhaps it's time for me

12:03.490 --> 12:06.324
to take a more direct hand
in this enquiry.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.727
With all due respect,
Governor,

12:08.729 --> 12:11.396
I am trying
to train pilots here.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.332
How are they to progress
under these circumstances?

12:14.334 --> 12:16.501
Certainly not while
they are all grounded.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.369
You're quite right.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.505
Perhaps getting your cadets
back into space

12:20.507 --> 12:23.675
would be to our
mutual advantage.

12:23.677 --> 12:27.245

Are you sure you're all
committed to this?

12:31.118 --> 12:33.118
We've made our choice.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.153
There's no
turning back now.

12:38.457 --> 12:42.260
Kinda surprised
they're letting us go up
in the middle of all this.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.395
Well, we have to make
the most of this chance.

12:44.397 --> 12:46.264
We might not get another.

12:46.266 --> 12:49.367
Okay, listen.
There's a rebel ship nearby,
waiting for my signal.

12:49.369 --> 12:52.103
Watch me.
When I go, you go.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.706
But you have to
trust me. Agreed?

12:54.708 --> 12:57.942
These rebels you say
are waiting for us...
You trust them?

12:57.944 --> 12:59.310
With my life.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.980
Yeah, and all of ours.

13:09.588 --> 13:11.156
SABINE: Well,
here goes nothing.

13:11.158 --> 13:13.258

13:13.260 --> 13:16.194
If you're receiving this,
lock onto my signal.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.140
Squadrons, prepare
to break formation

13:29.142 --> 13:32.010
and engage
in a simulated dogfight.

13:32.012 --> 13:34.078
<i>Your lasers</i>
<i>have been nullified,</i>

13:34.080 --> 13:38.783
<i>but your hits will still</i>
<i>register and be scored.</i>

13:38.785 --> 13:41.085
Beginning on my mark.

13:41.087 --> 13:43.454
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

13:43.456 --> 13:44.989
<i>Mark.</i>

14:00.206 --> 14:01.940
Nice shot, Hobbie.

14:07.179 --> 14:09.247
SABINE: Come on, Ezra.
Where are you?

14:23.195 --> 14:26.364
Sir, a rebel vessel
has entered the system.

14:28.067 --> 14:30.668
Sabine? Hope we're not
too late.

14:30.670 --> 14:33.304
SABINE: Right on time.
Come on, boys.

14:35.307 --> 14:38.142
WEDGE: Here we go.
Hobbie, Rake, on me.

14:45.050 --> 14:48.987
Four cadets have broken off
from the main group
toward the rebel ship.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.655
We have our defectors.

14:50.657 --> 14:53.224
PRYCE: <i> Cadets, return</i>
<i>to base immediately.</i>

14:53.226 --> 14:55.260
<i>This is your only warning.</i>

14:55.262 --> 14:57.829
SABINE: Negative, Command.
You're gonna have to
come and get us.

15:03.535 --> 15:04.903
(BEEPS)

15:06.839 --> 15:08.206
SABINE: We've lost power!

15:08.208 --> 15:10.341
Our fighters were rigged!

15:13.913 --> 15:16.180
Captain, destroy
one of the pods.

15:19.885 --> 15:21.085
WEDGE: Rake!

15:21.087 --> 15:23.655
Now, target
the rebel transport.

15:30.396 --> 15:33.031
SABINE: Ezra! Abort!
Get outta here!

15:33.033 --> 15:35.300
No, Sabine!
We're coming for you.

15:37.269 --> 15:39.404
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)

15:39.406 --> 15:41.606
We can't take
another hit like that.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.341
We're not
leaving her behind!

15:46.412 --> 15:48.313
We don't have
a choice, Ezra!

15:48.315 --> 15:50.248
We can't help her
if we're dead.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.450
Chopper, get us
into hyperspace now!

16:05.898 --> 16:08.800
I have so many questions.

16:08.802 --> 16:13.137
But first, I would like
to know which of you
is the rebel agent.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.141
Do you know
what this is?

16:17.143 --> 16:22.046
It's most effective
at extracting information
from the noncompliant.

16:24.016 --> 16:25.416
You.

16:30.522 --> 16:32.623
(GRUNTS)

16:32.625 --> 16:34.659
No, wait! It's me.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.461
I'm the rebel.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.162
Sabine, don't!

16:40.099 --> 16:42.133
And now we have a name.

16:42.135 --> 16:43.301
Thanks.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.269
Blast it. Sorry.

16:45.271 --> 16:48.373
Agent Kallus,
escort these two
back to their cell.

16:48.375 --> 16:51.442
Sabine and I have
a lot to talk about.

16:52.945 --> 16:56.047
Looks like they found someone
who can do your job.

16:58.550 --> 17:00.485
I won't talk.

17:00.487 --> 17:04.722
Well, let's see
how far we can get
without you needing to.

17:04.724 --> 17:07.492
Sabine Wren, is it?

17:07.494 --> 17:12.030
You are far too versed
in Imperial protocol
not to have been a cadet.

17:12.032 --> 17:15.333
And now you've come home,
little Mandalorian.

17:15.335 --> 17:19.037
So proud.
And tough, I think.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.204
We shall see.

17:26.912 --> 17:29.147
We have to do something.

17:29.149 --> 17:30.815
And end up like Rake?

17:30.817 --> 17:33.518
What the Empire has planned
for us has gotta be worse.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.552
Sabine came here
to get us out.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.721
We owe her.
We have to try.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.423
So what's your plan?

17:38.425 --> 17:41.092
I'll tell you
when I figure it out.

17:50.035 --> 17:52.103
(GRUNTING)

17:53.338 --> 17:55.339
Huh. Not bad.

17:55.341 --> 17:57.041
The Empire
taught me well.

17:57.043 --> 17:58.476
(SHOUTS)

18:04.216 --> 18:06.451
My clan
taught me better.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.252
(SHOUTS)

18:08.254 --> 18:09.487
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)
(GROANING)

18:18.063 --> 18:19.797
Maybe we can surprise
the guards.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.432
What, with our
lack of planning?

18:21.434 --> 18:24.135
Well, why don't you
think of something!
(DOOR OPENS)

18:24.137 --> 18:26.437
I hope you're better pilots
than you are soldiers.

18:26.439 --> 18:29.574
Sabine. We were coming
to rescue you.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.943
That's cute.
Come on. Let's go.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.223
Don't shoot.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.958
Give me a good reason
not to.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.127
Avoid levels
three through five.

18:49.129 --> 18:52.530
Hangar 24 is
your best possibility.

18:55.634 --> 18:59.003
Wait. Why should
we trust you?

18:59.005 --> 19:02.406
Tell Garazeb Orrelios
we're even.

19:06.478 --> 19:07.912
Go.

19:14.753 --> 19:16.487
That tub?
Are you kidding?

19:16.489 --> 19:19.290
Hey, it can take a hit.
Now, can you fly it or not?

19:19.292 --> 19:20.491
I can fly anything.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.894
Freeze! Don't move!

19:25.664 --> 19:27.064
(BEEPING)

19:36.642 --> 19:38.342
Young fools.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.385
Fighter closing fast! .6!

19:47.387 --> 19:48.920
That's gotta be Skerris.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.827
Wedge, can't you
go any faster?

19:56.829 --> 19:58.529
I told you
this thing was slow!

20:03.902 --> 20:05.536
Where are those friends
of yours?

20:05.538 --> 20:07.972
I can't signal.
Comms are jammed.

20:17.149 --> 20:19.784
SABINE: (SHOUTING)
Whoa!

20:32.698 --> 20:35.199
EZRA: (OVER COMLINK) <i> Sabine?</i>
<i>We knew you'd come through.</i>

20:35.201 --> 20:37.835
Ugh. Never been so happy
to hear your voice.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.904
Get to
the docking port, quick.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.772
(ENGINE SPUTTERING)

20:56.555 --> 20:57.622
Thought I told you
to leave.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.357
We stuck around,
just in case.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.192
(BEEPING)

21:14.239 --> 21:16.474
Commander Sato,
allow me to present

21:16.476 --> 21:19.944
Lieutenants Wedge Antilles
and... Hobbie.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.647
Formerly of
the Galactic Empire.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.649
Commander, we heard
you're looking
for some good pilots.

21:24.651 --> 21:28.653
Indeed, we are.
Welcome to the Rebellion.
