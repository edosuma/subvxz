<i>This is more retarded than when I got</i>
<i>that gumball stuck up my nose</i>.

00:44.722 --> 00:48.681
<i>Or the time I wanted to be</i>
<i>the first white Harlem Globetrotter</i>.

00:51.095 --> 00:53.154
<i>And it's more embarrassing</i>
<i>than the time</i>...

00:53.331 --> 00:57.062
...<i>my mom walked in on me while I was</i>
<i>trying to simulate vaginal friction</i>...

00:57.235 --> 00:59.999
...<i>by rubbing my boner between</i>
<i>the mattress and box springs</i>.

01:00.171 --> 01:01.900
Why don't you go out and play.

01:02.073 --> 01:03.904
lt's such a beautiful day.

01:04.075 --> 01:06.873
<i>No, this tops it</i>.

01:07.044 --> 01:09.342
<i>And it's all because of Erica</i>.

01:14.018 --> 01:15.246
<i>Erica</i>.

01:15.720 --> 01:18.746
<i>It sounds so much like ''erotica. ''</i>

01:20.691 --> 01:21.919
<i>And it's fitting:</i>

01:22.093 --> 01:24.152
<i>She's a walking wet dream</i>.

01:28.699 --> 01:30.633
<i>The kind of girl</i>
<i>whose mere glance at you</i>...

01:30.801 --> 01:33.929
...<i>could get your pecker</i>
<i>to stand up and say, ''Howdy. ''</i>

01:34.105 --> 01:36.505
<i>And not your normal,</i>
<i>run-of-the-mill erection</i>.

01:36.674 --> 01:39.507
<i>We're talking the kind</i>
<i>that could be picked up on radar</i>.

01:40.011 --> 01:41.672
<i>The kind you could hang a flag from</i>.

01:50.121 --> 01:52.055
<i>And her breasts</i>.

01:52.223 --> 01:54.191
<i>They must have tractor beams in them</i>.

01:54.358 --> 01:57.725
<i>They pull my hands toward them</i>
<i>like the Death Star</i>...

01:57.895 --> 01:59.419
...<i>dragging in the</i> Millennium Falcon.

02:08.739 --> 02:10.138
Come on, guys.

02:23.554 --> 02:27.251
lf l had breasts like that,
l could have ruled the world.

02:30.194 --> 02:32.560
You are in love with her, no?

02:33.097 --> 02:35.657
No, l'm not.

02:35.833 --> 02:38.563
Then why are you sitting so funny?

02:39.537 --> 02:41.232
Nonno.

02:42.073 --> 02:44.064
Don't be ashamed.

02:44.241 --> 02:46.300
A man is two people:

02:46.477 --> 02:48.638
Himself and his penis.

02:48.813 --> 02:51.441
A man always takes his friend
to the party...

02:51.616 --> 02:54.312
...but of the two,
the friend is nicer...

02:54.485 --> 02:58.046
...because he is more able
to show his feelings.

02:59.223 --> 03:03.626
Does this Erica know
what you think about her?

03:04.528 --> 03:06.655
She's got a boyfriend.

03:07.365 --> 03:09.390
They are not lovers?

03:10.234 --> 03:12.600
-l don't think so.
-That is good.

03:12.770 --> 03:15.500
one pubic hair
between a man and a woman...

03:15.673 --> 03:18.608
...can be stronger
than the Atlantic cable.

03:18.776 --> 03:20.368
You're telling me.

03:20.544 --> 03:22.478
What is your problem with the <i>bella</i> ?

03:22.647 --> 03:26.811
She goes off to college on the East Coast
in three months.

03:26.984 --> 03:29.544
Then you must declare
your love to her immediately.

03:29.887 --> 03:31.218
-Are you crazy?
-You must.

03:31.389 --> 03:33.789
-lt is the only way.
-oh, no, no, no.

03:33.958 --> 03:36.859
She'll think l'm a spaz.

03:37.028 --> 03:40.691
Then you prefer to sit funny
the rest of your life?

03:40.865 --> 03:44.562
Now, listen, <i>ragazzo,</i>
l will tell you a story.

03:44.735 --> 03:47.829
lt is about your great-great-grandfather...

03:48.005 --> 03:50.269
...<i>Giuseppe Luigi Bendini</i>.

03:50.441 --> 03:54.434
<i>When he was a boy your age,</i>
<i>he was in love</i>...

03:54.612 --> 03:58.275
...<i>with the most beautiful girl</i>
<i>in the village of Cascata</i>.

03:59.350 --> 04:01.318
<i>But the</i> bella...

04:01.485 --> 04:03.715
...<i>she did not see anything</i>
<i>in Giuseppe</i>.

04:03.888 --> 04:08.325
<i>So one day, Giuseppe,</i>
<i>an enterprising young boy</i>...

04:08.492 --> 04:10.357
...<i>declared his love to her</i>.

04:10.661 --> 04:12.185
<i>He said:</i>

04:12.363 --> 04:15.992
<i>''I, Giuseppe Luigi Bendini,</i>
<i>love you</i>...

04:16.166 --> 04:19.192
...<i>and to prove that I will</i>
<i>always be there for you</i>...

04:19.370 --> 04:25.002
...<i>I will stand under your balcony</i>
<i>day and night without relent</i>...

04:25.176 --> 04:28.009
...<i>until you fall in love with me. ''</i>

04:32.750 --> 04:34.342
So Giuseppe...

04:34.518 --> 04:38.887
...<i>stood outside that balcony</i>
<i>day and night</i>.

04:39.056 --> 04:41.115
<i>Night and day</i>.

04:41.292 --> 04:46.821
<i>Until, finally, his love came</i>
<i>out to the balcony and cried:</i>

04:46.997 --> 04:51.297
<i>''Giuseppe Luigi Bendini, I love you!''</i>

04:51.469 --> 04:52.663
<i>So Giuseppe</i>...

04:52.837 --> 04:55.897
...climbed up to the balcony
and into her bed.

04:56.073 --> 04:59.304
<i>They made love so passionately</i>...

04:59.477 --> 05:02.674
...that the ground shook.

05:02.847 --> 05:05.338
And villagers today still believe...

05:05.516 --> 05:09.452
...that's what caused
the 1 874 earthquake.

05:12.523 --> 05:14.013
l can't do that.

05:14.191 --> 05:15.988
<i>You can, my friend</i>.

05:16.427 --> 05:19.555
Women are like breaking into a bank.

05:19.730 --> 05:21.129
lt takes nerve.

05:21.298 --> 05:22.959
lt takes daring.

05:23.134 --> 05:27.833
Sometimes you need a little bit
of dynamite to blow the vault.

05:31.108 --> 05:32.871
<i>I don't know what it was</i>.

05:33.043 --> 05:37.707
<i>Maybe all the benzoyl peroxide</i>
<i>in my zit cream had affected my brain</i>.

05:37.882 --> 05:42.512
<i>Or maybe I had a strange fetish</i>
<i>for humiliation at the hands of a woman</i>.

05:42.686 --> 05:45.416
<i>I figured this stemmed</i>
<i>from watching too many episodes</i>...

05:45.589 --> 05:50.253
...<i>of Julie Newmar as the Catwoman</i>
<i>in all those</i> Batman <i>reruns</i>.

05:50.427 --> 05:52.588
<i>But it seemed like an audacious idea</i>.

05:52.763 --> 05:54.924
<i>I decided to try it</i>.

05:55.499 --> 05:57.933
Peter, that is so sweet.

05:58.102 --> 06:00.002
<i>I was beginning to think</i>
<i>this might work</i>...

06:00.171 --> 06:02.196
...<i>when she said</i>
<i>the most dreaded two words</i>...

06:02.373 --> 06:03.738
...<i>in the English language</i>.

06:03.908 --> 06:06.376
But, Peter, we're just friends.

06:06.544 --> 06:08.011
<i>''Just friends. ''</i>

06:08.179 --> 06:11.637
<i>The words hit me like screaming lead</i>
<i>shot from a</i> .<i>38</i>.

06:11.816 --> 06:13.750
l wanna be...

06:13.918 --> 06:15.783
...just friends.

06:23.928 --> 06:25.589
lt's just a flesh wound, my friend.

06:25.763 --> 06:27.287
lt will not kill you.

06:27.464 --> 06:29.557
Get back up and fight.

06:34.772 --> 06:36.296
l'm not gonna give up so easily.

06:36.473 --> 06:38.236
But, Peter--

06:38.409 --> 06:42.743
<i>I was rudely interrupted</i>
<i>by Erica's boyfriend, Nick</i>.

06:47.351 --> 06:51.014
<i>He's what I call a ''gaping asshole. ''</i>

06:54.024 --> 06:58.552
<i>You know, the type of guy that's</i>
<i>going to college on a football scholarship</i>.

06:58.729 --> 07:01.926
<i>But what bothers me most</i>
<i>is he's one of those macho dicks</i>...

07:02.099 --> 07:05.660
...<i>who's always grabbing his crotch</i>
<i>and adjusting his balls</i>.

07:05.836 --> 07:08.168
<i>I mean, what's the deal?</i>

07:08.339 --> 07:10.739
<i>He acts like he's a guard</i>
<i>at the Tower of London</i>.

07:10.908 --> 07:16.608
<i>He's gotta check every 1 0 seconds</i>
<i>to see if the crown jewels are still there</i>.

07:21.485 --> 07:24.648
<i>And how come every asshole I know</i>
<i>has to make that noise?</i>

07:28.025 --> 07:31.119
<i>You can hear a symphony of those</i>
<i>in any boys' locker room</i>.

07:31.295 --> 07:32.990
<i>Is it like a lion roaring?</i>

07:33.163 --> 07:35.290
<i>The asshole who can hawk</i>
<i>a loogie the loudest</i>...

07:35.466 --> 07:37.730
...<i>is the leader of the herd?</i>

07:37.902 --> 07:41.065
<i>Needless to say, Nick has been</i>
<i>my nemesis since I was 5</i>.

07:45.709 --> 07:48.701
-l forbid you to go out dressed like that.
-Dad.

07:48.879 --> 07:52.337
No self-respecting Christian girl
would be seen in public in a--

07:52.516 --> 07:55.679
Just get in the house.
Get in the house.

07:59.757 --> 08:01.987
Erica. Erica. Erica!

08:05.529 --> 08:08.760
<i>Erica looked more doable than</i>
<i>Barbara Feldon in</i> Get Smart.

08:08.933 --> 08:10.195
Erica! Get your--

08:10.367 --> 08:13.859
<i>She kissed Nick so hard, I'm sure they</i>
<i>could've swallowed each others uvulas</i>.

08:14.038 --> 08:15.699
Erica, if you--

08:19.209 --> 08:20.733
What the hell's his story?

08:20.911 --> 08:25.405
<i>She then proceeded to tell Nick</i>
<i>what I was up to</i>.

08:37.561 --> 08:42.464
<i>And if things weren't hard enough,</i>
<i>I encountered more unexpected problems</i>.

08:42.633 --> 08:44.498
Well, our prayers
have been answered.

08:44.668 --> 08:47.228
l have been asking God
to send someone to take her away...

08:47.404 --> 08:49.395
...from that heathen boyfriend, Nick.

08:49.573 --> 08:50.767
-You're a miracle.
-Yes.

08:50.941 --> 08:52.875
<i>Erica's dad can never</i>
<i>have a conversation</i>...

08:53.043 --> 08:57.537
...<i>without quoting some guy named</i>
<i>Zig Ziglar, a Christian motivational speaker</i>.

08:57.715 --> 09:00.912
<i>Frankly, I'd never be caught dead</i>
<i>quoting some guy named Zig</i>.

09:01.085 --> 09:05.112
The difference between you
and that barbarian, Nick, is that you--

09:05.289 --> 09:06.586
Remember what he said.

09:06.757 --> 09:11.717
--have a ''swelled heart,
not a swelled head.''

09:11.895 --> 09:15.763
<i>I wanted to tell him that his daughter</i>
<i>gave me both. But I didn't</i>.

09:16.133 --> 09:17.896
Peter, l thought you might be hungry...

09:18.068 --> 09:20.559
...so l brought cookies
l made for the church bake sale.

09:20.738 --> 09:22.968
<i>I wasn't all that surprised</i>
<i>by the cookies</i>.

09:23.140 --> 09:26.803
<i>This is the same woman who encourages</i>
<i>her youngest daughter, Mary</i>...

09:26.977 --> 09:28.501
...<i>to play with nun dolls</i>.

09:28.679 --> 09:31.409
''Now say 50 more.''
''Hail Mary, Hail Mary...

09:31.582 --> 09:33.311
...Hail Mary, Hail Mary, Hail Mary....''

09:35.219 --> 09:36.709
-Thanks.
-Yes, yes, yes.

09:36.887 --> 09:38.149
<i>Now let's face it</i>.

09:38.322 --> 09:40.916
<i>It's a proven fact that girls</i>
<i>do not fall in love</i>...

09:41.091 --> 09:43.491
...<i>with any boy her parents</i>
<i>actually like</i>.

09:43.660 --> 09:45.594
<i>I vowed at that very moment</i>
<i>that I would</i>...

09:45.763 --> 09:47.890
...<i>find a way to make her parents</i>
<i>hate me</i>.

09:48.065 --> 09:49.930
<i>I set Giuseppe to work on it</i>.

09:53.504 --> 09:55.233
Go ahead, Peter, try it.

10:14.858 --> 10:17.691
<i>My dad's reaction to my plan,</i>
<i>when he heard about it from Mom</i>...

10:17.861 --> 10:19.988
...<i>registered on the Richter scale</i>
<i>at Caltech</i>.

10:20.164 --> 10:22.029
Peter. Peter!

10:22.199 --> 10:24.861
Stop acting like you don't hear me. Peter.

10:27.304 --> 10:30.740
Hell's bells.
You get inside right this instant.

10:30.908 --> 10:33.274
-l'm not leaving this spot.
-Yes, you are.

10:33.444 --> 10:35.207
-No, l'm not.
-Yes, you are.

10:35.379 --> 10:37.904
You stop listening
to your grandfather's nonsense.

10:38.082 --> 10:39.845
He's not all there. Now, come on.

10:40.017 --> 10:42.952
-Let go. l'm not hurting anyone.
-You are acting like a fool.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.417
-Now, come on.
-No.

10:44.588 --> 10:46.078
-Give it up, son.
-Mom!

10:46.256 --> 10:48.417
-Listen to your father.
-This is ridiculous.

10:48.592 --> 10:51.254
What will the neighbors think?
Some of them are my patients.

10:51.428 --> 10:54.124
They'll stop coming to me
if they think my son's a pervert...

10:54.298 --> 10:55.925
...who stands under girls' windows.

10:56.100 --> 10:58.898
-You're just embarrassing our entire family.
-Dad!

10:59.069 --> 11:00.593
-l'm sorry.
-Now, let go, Peter.

11:03.540 --> 11:04.700
My New Guinea impatiens!

11:06.543 --> 11:07.976
-l'm sorry.
-What are you doing?

11:08.145 --> 11:09.612
<i>Good old Nonno</i>.

11:09.780 --> 11:11.372
<i>Whenever a situation calls for it</i>...

11:11.548 --> 11:13.880
...<i>my grandfather pulls</i>
<i>his ''infirm old man '' routine</i>.

11:14.051 --> 11:15.177
l'm sorry.

11:15.352 --> 11:18.185
<i>He's saved my life hundreds of times</i>.

11:18.789 --> 11:20.051
l'm sorry.

11:21.258 --> 11:24.022
<i>The same couldn't be said</i>
<i>for my best friend, Matt</i>.

11:24.194 --> 11:25.627
This is my last chance.

11:25.796 --> 11:29.129
Look, you know, l just don't wanna
see you setting yourself up like this.

11:29.299 --> 11:31.699
l have been in love with Erica
since we were kids.

11:31.869 --> 11:34.167
We used to play
Cowboys and lndians together.

11:34.771 --> 11:37.535
When we were little,
we used to do everything together.

11:37.708 --> 11:41.337
When you get mad at someone,
you go like this:

11:42.112 --> 11:44.774
-lt was great.
-lt'll never work.

11:46.116 --> 11:47.378
Why not?

11:47.551 --> 11:48.950
Because we're losers.

11:49.119 --> 11:52.088
Look, we've been picked
by genetic selection...

11:52.256 --> 11:56.215
...to be the world's biggest living proof
that this world is fucked.

11:56.393 --> 11:59.920
-How's that?
-We lost the DNA lottery.

12:00.097 --> 12:02.122
We didn't get the asshole gene.

12:02.299 --> 12:04.199
See, we're the nice guys.

12:04.368 --> 12:05.801
We're never gonna succeed.

12:05.969 --> 12:08.802
only the assholes get the girls
and the dough, bro.

12:09.506 --> 12:12.236
-You've got it all figured out.
-Damn straight, l do.

12:12.409 --> 12:14.775
My parents think l'm going
to college in the fall.

12:14.945 --> 12:17.812
l'm not going to college so l can be
a jerk with a degree...

12:17.981 --> 12:19.881
...who assistant-manages
a Burger King.

12:20.050 --> 12:22.450
''Would you like fries with that, please?''
No way.

12:22.619 --> 12:24.951
-So you're just gonna give up?
-Yep.

12:25.122 --> 12:27.955
-And l suppose you want me to give up too?
-Exactly.

12:28.125 --> 12:31.959
You gotta become comfortably numb.

12:32.129 --> 12:35.189
You can't let anyone
or anything disappoint you.

12:35.365 --> 12:37.196
You gotta be self-sufficient.

12:37.367 --> 12:41.804
l mean, look at me.
Do l need a girl like Erica? No.

12:43.073 --> 12:46.372
Since you're gonna be here all summer,
mind if l use your mailing address?

12:46.543 --> 12:48.408
-What for?
-l sent away for something...

12:48.579 --> 12:50.877
...and l don't want my mom
to accidentally open it.

12:51.048 --> 12:54.506
So l figured you'll be out here,
you can intercept it before anyone gets it.

12:55.385 --> 12:56.613
-okay, l guess.
-Yes.

12:57.254 --> 12:59.484
Hey. But admit it...

12:59.656 --> 13:01.886
...sometimes you wish
you had a girlfriend.

13:02.059 --> 13:03.390
No way.

13:03.560 --> 13:05.255
Blockbuster, Domino's Pizza...

13:05.429 --> 13:07.329
...Rosy Palm and her five friends...

13:07.497 --> 13:10.364
...are all l need
for a great Saturday night.

13:10.734 --> 13:12.201
Maybe if you're 1 4.

13:12.369 --> 13:14.428
okay, you do have a point.

13:14.605 --> 13:19.201
Sometimes l do need to spice up
my love life a little bit.

13:19.943 --> 13:23.071
l'd like you to meet
my date for the evening, Peter.

13:26.149 --> 13:29.346
You know, l read in <i>Barely Legal</i>
magazine about this guy...

13:29.519 --> 13:31.544
...he got off humping fruit.

13:31.722 --> 13:33.280
You're a sick puppy.

13:33.857 --> 13:37.258
The sun is gonna make it
nice and warm.

13:37.427 --> 13:39.054
Just like the real thing.

13:39.429 --> 13:40.862
Well, what about the seeds?

13:41.465 --> 13:44.025
Come on. l'm not gonna go down on it.

13:51.174 --> 13:53.438
<i>I amused myself</i>
<i>by watching the neighborhood</i>.

13:53.610 --> 13:55.601
<i>Life is my TV</i>.

13:55.779 --> 13:58.680
<i>And it was a little more interesting</i>
<i>than network television</i>.

13:58.849 --> 14:00.111
<i>There was Mr. Mays</i>.

14:00.284 --> 14:03.447
<i>My parents think he works</i>
<i>for the CIA or the FBI</i>.

14:03.620 --> 14:05.383
<i>It's because every time</i>
<i>he comes home</i>...

14:05.555 --> 14:07.682
...<i>he drives around the block</i>
<i>again and again</i>...

14:07.858 --> 14:09.792
...<i>to make sure he's not being followed</i>.

14:09.960 --> 14:13.293
<i>There's a kid on the street</i>
<i>that's a pyromaniac</i>.

14:19.970 --> 14:22.598
<i>Matt made sure his parents</i>
<i>had left him alone in the house</i>.

14:23.974 --> 14:25.771
Bye, guys.

14:26.310 --> 14:30.804
<i>He then went to the upstairs bathroom</i>
<i>to make</i> amore <i>with his watermelon</i>.

14:31.882 --> 14:33.873
<i>And the guy across the street</i>.

14:34.051 --> 14:35.416
<i>I forget his name</i>.

14:35.585 --> 14:37.246
<i>But he seems so sad</i>.

14:37.421 --> 14:38.979
<i>His wife has cancer</i>.

14:39.156 --> 14:43.525
<i>He dutifully takes her out</i>
<i>for a breath of fresh air every day</i>.

14:44.161 --> 14:45.958
<i>It's a good thing Erica isn't around</i>.

14:46.129 --> 14:49.621
<i>I got a woody watching Ms. Lewis</i>
<i>work out to</i> Buns of Steel.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.768
And pull. And pull. And pull.

14:51.935 --> 14:54.460
<i>Mr. Mays put in a second lap</i>.

14:59.309 --> 15:03.473
<i>The crazy lady next door</i>
<i>eats her dinner in the car</i>.

15:03.647 --> 15:07.208
<i>I was dismayed to see history</i>
<i>repeating itself</i>.

15:07.384 --> 15:08.783
<i>Maybe Matt is right</i>.

15:08.952 --> 15:10.943
<i>Some people are born</i>
<i>with the asshole gene</i>...

15:11.121 --> 15:13.146
...<i>and some of us aren't</i>.

15:17.160 --> 15:20.493
<i>There was nothing much happening</i>
<i>to keep me amused at night</i>.

15:20.664 --> 15:24.464
<i>At about 1 0, I saw Matt go out</i>
<i>to the upstairs balcony</i>.

15:24.634 --> 15:26.431
<i>If he had been in there all that time</i>...

15:26.603 --> 15:29.595
...<i>that watermelon now had</i>
<i>more holes in it than a Wiffle ball</i>.

15:30.307 --> 15:32.298
<i>Only the crazy lady was out</i>.

15:32.476 --> 15:34.535
<i>She was cutting her grass</i>.

15:39.116 --> 15:42.108
<i>It looked like there was something good</i>
<i>on TV over at my house</i>...

15:42.285 --> 15:44.480
...<i>and I wanted to watch it</i>.

15:44.654 --> 15:47.623
<i>But something got in the way</i>.

15:47.958 --> 15:51.519
<i>So I watered the plants instead</i>.

15:55.532 --> 15:58.467
<i>I figured I should take advantage</i>
<i>of the time I had on my hands</i>.

15:58.635 --> 16:00.967
<i>I vowed that if I were</i>
<i>to become Erica's boyfriend</i>...

16:01.138 --> 16:04.505
...<i>I had to become the greatest lover</i>
<i>she had ever known</i>.

16:05.075 --> 16:09.774
<i>In pursuit of that goal, I decided</i>
<i>I would become an expert in love</i>.

16:10.347 --> 16:12.838
<i>I started by reading</i> The Joy of Sexuality.

16:13.116 --> 16:17.143
<i>It wasn't the descriptions of the wildly</i>
<i>uninhibited Chinese-style sex positions</i>...

16:17.320 --> 16:19.811
...<i>like the</i>
<i>''wailing monkey clasping a tree''</i>...

16:19.990 --> 16:22.424
...<i>or ''wild geese flying on their backs ''</i>...

16:22.592 --> 16:24.492
...<i>that I found most enlightening</i>.

16:24.661 --> 16:27.425
<i>It was the guy they picked</i>
<i>to illustrate</i>...

16:27.597 --> 16:29.428
...<i>all the exotic conjugations</i>.

16:29.599 --> 16:32.466
<i>The guy is butt-ugly</i>.

16:33.003 --> 16:34.163
<i>And the girl was a babe</i>.

16:34.771 --> 16:36.102
<i>This was inspiring</i>.

16:36.273 --> 16:40.642
<i>I mean, if this</i> Quest for Fire <i>reject</i>
<i>could get laid, why couldn't I?</i>

17:03.934 --> 17:07.061
oh, good, my parents aren't home
from church yet.

17:09.339 --> 17:10.771
l'll meet you inside.

17:10.941 --> 17:13.034
l'm gonna have a talk
with your friend Peter.

17:13.210 --> 17:14.540
okay.

17:32.095 --> 17:34.222
So you're still here, huh?

17:35.232 --> 17:38.258
l would have thought you'd have
gotten smart and given up by now.

17:40.637 --> 17:42.434
Why do guys always make that noise?

17:42.606 --> 17:43.834
What noise?

17:44.007 --> 17:45.474
This noise:

17:49.246 --> 17:51.680
l mean, you guys spit so much.

17:51.848 --> 17:53.839
Makes you wonder
what you've been sucking on.

17:56.119 --> 17:57.484
Shut up.

17:58.321 --> 17:59.481
oh, what a--

17:59.656 --> 18:03.683
What a demonstrative display
of masculine aggression.

18:03.860 --> 18:06.920
Did you know
that such behavior is a sign of...

18:07.430 --> 18:09.796
...latent homosexuality?

18:13.069 --> 18:15.367
l think it's time you left.

18:20.844 --> 18:23.210
-l'm not leaving.
-You wanna fight?

18:23.713 --> 18:24.941
l'll give you a free shot.

18:26.449 --> 18:28.178
Go for it, my friend.

18:28.351 --> 18:30.444
<i>How could I refuse this invitation?</i>

18:30.620 --> 18:32.110
<i>I was going to lose this fight</i>...

18:32.656 --> 18:35.056
...<i>but at least I could get</i>
<i>one killer shot in</i>.

18:35.225 --> 18:37.318
<i>So I charged the Prince of Darkness</i>.

18:37.627 --> 18:39.959
<i>Then I realized my mistake</i>.

18:40.130 --> 18:41.427
<i>It was a trick</i>.

18:41.598 --> 18:43.566
<i>It felt like my nuts had exploded</i>.

18:43.733 --> 18:47.066
<i>And it sounded like a pair of water balloons</i>
<i>dropped off a building</i>.

18:56.479 --> 18:58.344
That'll teach you, huh?

19:08.124 --> 19:12.390
<i>I took it as a good sign that Erica</i>
<i>was curious to see if I was still there</i>.

19:21.871 --> 19:26.274
<i>It was important that Erica never see me</i>
<i>flag in my devotion by leaving my post</i>.

19:26.443 --> 19:29.412
<i>But on the other hand, I didn't</i>
<i>wanna smell like my uncle Lou</i>...

19:29.579 --> 19:32.639
...<i>when Erica finally buckled</i>
<i>under my romantic vigilance</i>.

19:32.816 --> 19:35.944
<i>So I figured while she was</i>
<i>getting ready for the day</i>...

19:36.119 --> 19:39.555
...<i>I'd pop inside for a quick shower</i>
<i>and some Cheerios</i>.

19:39.723 --> 19:41.156
What are you doing?

19:41.324 --> 19:43.189
Changing the locks.

19:43.360 --> 19:46.193
When you finally give up
this nonsense...

19:46.363 --> 19:48.627
...l'll let you back inside.

19:49.432 --> 19:51.093
Dad, give me a break.

19:51.267 --> 19:52.928
Forget it.

19:59.476 --> 20:01.239
Mom.

20:02.012 --> 20:03.309
<i>This was desperate</i>.

20:03.480 --> 20:05.209
<i>No food. No water</i>.

20:05.382 --> 20:06.508
Nice.

20:06.683 --> 20:09.618
<i>And I really needed to do</i>
<i>some low-altitude bombing</i>.

20:21.631 --> 20:25.032
<i>I had no choice but to impose</i>
<i>on my best friend, Matt</i>.

20:26.336 --> 20:27.667
Hey, Matt, open up!

20:27.837 --> 20:31.034
l'm showering, man!
The side door's open!

20:44.721 --> 20:46.689
What about a little privacy?

20:46.856 --> 20:49.086
oh, man. Light a match.

20:49.259 --> 20:50.954
Sorry. Hey, where's your toothpaste?

20:51.127 --> 20:54.494
oh, get out of here. People are gonna
think we're queer or something.

21:30.200 --> 21:32.100
What the hell are you doing?

21:34.671 --> 21:36.468
l started reading
<i>The Joy of Sexuality</i>...

21:36.639 --> 21:39.005
...checked out the part
about cunnilingus.

21:39.175 --> 21:41.006
Wanted to make sure l was in shape.

21:41.444 --> 21:42.968
Cunnilingus.

21:43.146 --> 21:45.410
Yo, you've been checking out
for my mail?

21:45.582 --> 21:46.776
Nothing came yet.

21:46.950 --> 21:48.542
Brought you some food.

21:49.886 --> 21:52.377
-No, thanks.
-Come on, it's good.

21:59.095 --> 22:02.292
Sorry about the noise, Peter,
but l'm putting locks on all the windows.

22:02.465 --> 22:05.366
l don't want Erica pulling another stunt
like she did yesterday.

22:09.639 --> 22:11.300
Man.

22:11.841 --> 22:14.469
l wish you'd give this up, man.

22:15.278 --> 22:19.738
Listen, l'm not so sure l believe
your theory about the asshole gene.

22:19.916 --> 22:23.113
oh, come on. Look.
l mean, it's everywhere you look.

22:23.286 --> 22:25.914
-Hey, you want a taste?
-Yeah.

22:26.556 --> 22:28.717
That's an isolated case.

22:29.225 --> 22:30.522
All right.

22:30.693 --> 22:35.528
What if l told you that even
our Founding Fathers were assholes?

22:35.698 --> 22:37.723
What are you talking about?

22:37.901 --> 22:41.234
Take the Boston Tea Party,
for instance. All right?

22:41.404 --> 22:43.099
Even with taxation...

22:43.273 --> 22:45.764
...the British tea cost less
than the colonial tea...

22:45.942 --> 22:49.469
...produced by those guys
like John Hancock and Sam Adams.

22:49.646 --> 22:51.204
No, don't do it!

22:51.714 --> 22:52.942
No!

22:57.420 --> 23:00.548
See, the Boston Tea Party
wasn't a political act.

23:00.723 --> 23:02.850
lt was an industrial espionage.

23:03.026 --> 23:05.927
lt was a scam by John Hancock
and Sam Adams...

23:06.095 --> 23:08.859
...to put the British out of business.

23:09.032 --> 23:10.499
See?

23:10.667 --> 23:13.227
Even our Founding Fathers
were a bunch of assholes.

23:13.703 --> 23:15.227
You've got a point.

23:15.405 --> 23:19.671
But l've been thinking about this,
and l got a couple theories of my own.

23:19.843 --> 23:21.242
Shoot.

23:21.411 --> 23:25.575
Well, l think you can tell a lot
about a woman's personality...

23:25.748 --> 23:27.215
...from the shape of her breasts.

23:27.383 --> 23:29.146
What are you getting into right now?

23:29.319 --> 23:31.810
-Take Mrs. olsen, for instance.
-What have you done?

23:31.988 --> 23:34.320
Her boobs look like the turret on a tank.

23:35.124 --> 23:39.026
Her mammaries look like they could shoot
a mortar charge, blow you to smithereens.

23:39.195 --> 23:42.130
You can see she has the same
iron-fisted personality...

23:42.298 --> 23:43.526
...that matches her hooters.

23:43.700 --> 23:45.497
--you have ever been in your life.

23:45.668 --> 23:47.533
All right, you got a point.

23:47.704 --> 23:49.001
Go on.

23:49.172 --> 23:51.834
Now, take the crazy lady next door.

23:52.008 --> 23:53.498
Now, don't give me the willies.

23:54.010 --> 23:56.535
No, look.
She's got mashed-potato breasts.

23:56.913 --> 23:58.437
Dude, they're so weird.

23:58.615 --> 24:01.209
-Yeah. Right. And she's weird too.
-All right.

24:02.018 --> 24:04.885
But, you know,
you're just giving me easy examples.

24:05.054 --> 24:07.852
All right. Ms. Lewis.

24:08.258 --> 24:11.284
Bosoms like melons that have
been in the store a little too long.

24:11.895 --> 24:14.921
You may be taking a chance,
buying them after the expiration date...

24:15.098 --> 24:18.158
...but if you're lucky,
they might still be good.

24:18.334 --> 24:20.598
She's the same way.

24:20.770 --> 24:24.103
She's a little older,
but l bet she's a good woman.

24:26.376 --> 24:32.281
okay, now, what can you deduce
from Erica's breasts?

24:34.751 --> 24:37.515
l've done a lot of thinking about this.

24:38.121 --> 24:40.715
As you can see,
her breasts are extremely firm.

24:40.890 --> 24:43.552
So taut, you expect the nipples
to blow off...

24:43.726 --> 24:45.751
...like a cork out of a champagne bottle.

24:46.663 --> 24:51.362
l see this as a reflection
of Erica's effervescent, wild...

24:51.534 --> 24:53.661
...life-is-a-party personality.

24:53.836 --> 24:56.862
lt's also self-evident that her breasts
are on the small side.

24:57.040 --> 25:00.168
l suspect it's gonna take centuries
for them to droop.

25:00.343 --> 25:03.744
Meaning that she will
always be young at heart.

25:03.913 --> 25:09.112
But here's something that you may miss
upon a cursory glance:

25:09.285 --> 25:14.086
Some women's nipples can become hard
like pink pencil erasers...

25:14.257 --> 25:17.226
...so hard that you could dial
a phone with them, you know?

25:17.627 --> 25:21.290
These women, l suspect, are often more
concerned with the particulars in life...

25:21.464 --> 25:24.433
...like avoiding laying in the wet spot.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.363
But with Erica...

25:26.903 --> 25:33.365
...notice how the nipple merges
almost effortlessly...

25:33.543 --> 25:36.068
...with the areola...

25:36.245 --> 25:39.612
...bringing a softness to her nipular area.

25:40.049 --> 25:43.815
l think this suggests a softness of heart.

25:43.987 --> 25:45.648
l mean, this is a girl...

25:45.822 --> 25:50.555
...more concerned with passion
than particulars.

25:53.896 --> 25:55.557
Am l right?

25:57.100 --> 25:58.499
Matt?

26:00.136 --> 26:02.832
Pete, l gotta go.

26:03.006 --> 26:05.839
Something l gotta do at home. See you.

26:15.251 --> 26:18.345
''l'm really hungry.

26:18.521 --> 26:20.989
Hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry.''

26:21.157 --> 26:23.887
<i>The only thing I had eaten that day</i>
<i>was Matt's watermelon</i>.

26:24.060 --> 26:26.688
<i>I hadn't eaten all of it</i>
<i>for obvious reasons</i>.

26:26.863 --> 26:30.196
<i>So I was pretty hungry by the time</i>
<i>Nonno snuck out of the house</i>.

26:40.977 --> 26:42.274
Get down.

26:53.656 --> 26:55.886
Nonno, what are you doing out here?

27:02.665 --> 27:03.893
Goal!

27:04.067 --> 27:06.865
Goal! Goal!

27:07.036 --> 27:09.300
-Goal!
-okay. okay.

27:09.472 --> 27:11.303
-Goal!
-okay. okay. Marge!

27:11.474 --> 27:14.034
Your dad thinks
he's in the World Cup again.

27:22.218 --> 27:25.483
l'm not cool enough.
She's never gonna fall for me.

27:25.655 --> 27:28.351
Standing out here
doesn't make any sense, Nonno.

27:28.524 --> 27:31.015
lt makes all the sense in the world.

27:31.194 --> 27:35.028
You are trying to make love to a woman.

27:35.198 --> 27:38.190
You must know,
deep in your heart of hearts...

27:38.367 --> 27:41.359
...that people are supposed to make love.

27:41.537 --> 27:43.937
lt is our main purpose in life.

27:44.107 --> 27:46.098
All those other activities--

27:46.275 --> 27:51.645
Playing the violin, washing dishes,
reading novels, drinking wine.

27:51.814 --> 27:58.014
--are just ways of passing time
until you can make love again.

27:58.688 --> 28:01.486
Then my whole life is passing time.

28:01.657 --> 28:02.954
This is never gonna work.

28:03.126 --> 28:05.094
This <i>bella,</i> Erica...

28:05.261 --> 28:06.956
...she will fall for you.

28:07.130 --> 28:08.427
lmpossible.

28:09.765 --> 28:11.289
Crazier things have happened.

28:11.467 --> 28:13.992
-Let me tell you another story.
-oh, great.

28:14.170 --> 28:16.866
Look at all the trouble
your last one got me into, Nonno.

28:17.039 --> 28:20.008
lt is about a young Navy pilot.

28:20.176 --> 28:24.374
He could perform
incredible maneuvers in his plane.

28:26.582 --> 28:29.107
Then, one day, he nearly crashed.

28:29.285 --> 28:34.154
The pilot went to the doctors
and declared his problem.

28:34.323 --> 28:35.881
Hemorrhoids.

28:36.058 --> 28:39.687
A mass of dilated veins in the rectum.

28:39.862 --> 28:41.295
The doctor had them removed.

28:41.864 --> 28:43.832
What's so romantic about this story?

28:44.000 --> 28:46.332
The pilot met this nurse.

28:46.502 --> 28:48.561
Twice a day she would change
his dressings...

28:48.738 --> 28:52.834
...and apply ointment
to his traumatized sphincter.

28:53.009 --> 28:54.840
The two got to talking.

28:55.011 --> 28:58.003
The nurse fell for the young pilot.

28:58.181 --> 29:02.277
Now, if that isn't love,
l don't know what is.

29:02.818 --> 29:05.480
After two weeks, the couple got married.

29:05.655 --> 29:08.886
And if it wasn't for a swelling anus...

29:09.058 --> 29:12.152
...the two would never have met.

29:12.828 --> 29:15.319
Now l don't believe any of your stories.

29:32.648 --> 29:34.639
lt's all true.

29:34.817 --> 29:37.308
Ask your mom and dad.

29:37.787 --> 29:40.654
-That was Mom and Dad?
-Yep.

30:55.931 --> 30:59.799
<i>My massive manhood must have been</i>
<i>sapping all the blood from my brain</i>.

30:59.969 --> 31:02.301
<i>That's the only way I could explain</i>
<i>my acceptance</i>...

31:02.471 --> 31:04.462
...<i>of this retarded, quixotic quest</i>.

31:04.640 --> 31:06.767
<i>Hours passed into days</i>.

31:08.010 --> 31:10.604
<i>Nick and I got to know</i>
<i>each other better</i>.

31:13.282 --> 31:14.874
<i>I had time on my hands</i>.

31:15.051 --> 31:17.417
<i>I read the entire</i>
<i>Kinsey reports and found out</i>...

31:17.586 --> 31:21.454
...<i>that 1 0 percent of all males</i>
<i>attempt self-fellatio</i>...

31:21.624 --> 31:24.593
...<i>and that 0.3 percent actually succeed</i>.

31:26.796 --> 31:29.663
<i>I had plenty of opportunity</i>
<i>to watch the TV of life</i>.

31:37.606 --> 31:40.507
<i>All summer, I never saw Erica</i>
<i>wear the same thing twice</i>.

31:54.590 --> 31:57.423
<i>And for Erica's sister,</i>
<i>Halloween came early</i>.

31:57.593 --> 32:00.084
-Now say 20 Hail Marys.
-Hail Mary. Hail Mary.

32:00.262 --> 32:03.789
<i>My dad couldn't figure out why</i>
<i>his New Guinea impatiens wouldn't grow</i>.

32:03.966 --> 32:05.263
<i>Neither could I</i>.

32:05.434 --> 32:07.664
<i>I had been watering it regularly</i>.

32:10.272 --> 32:12.934
<i>Surprisingly enough,</i>
<i>I earned some extra money on the side</i>.

32:13.109 --> 32:14.974
Since l know you'll
be here all the time...

32:15.144 --> 32:17.271
...l thought you could
babysit Robert tonight.

32:17.446 --> 32:20.438
<i>Hey, lady, did you ever think</i>
<i>that tonight might be the night</i>...

32:20.616 --> 32:23.949
...<i>that Erica and I tried the</i>
<i>''wailing monkey clasping a tree'' act?</i>

32:24.487 --> 32:27.513
<i>Erica's father took</i>
<i>a sculpting class that summer</i>.

32:27.690 --> 32:30.284
-What is it?
-lt's the baby Jesus.

32:31.160 --> 32:35.187
l figured l'd get a little head start
on our Nativity scene for next Christmas.

32:35.364 --> 32:39.824
<i>Little Jesus look more like an aborted fetus,</i>
<i>but I kept my mouth shut</i>.

32:40.002 --> 32:41.833
Give me my plane!

32:43.706 --> 32:45.230
<i>I took a liking to young Robert</i>.

32:45.408 --> 32:46.534
Give me my plane!

32:47.643 --> 32:50.134
<i>I was his guardian angel</i>.

32:51.313 --> 32:52.837
<i>Sort of</i>.

32:53.015 --> 32:56.917
The next time this guy bothers you,
all you have to do is stand up to him.

32:57.086 --> 32:59.782
All bullies are cowards.

32:59.955 --> 33:01.252
Trust me.

33:02.024 --> 33:04.322
<i>Days soon passed into weeks</i>.

33:04.560 --> 33:06.994
<i>The guy across the street</i>
<i>stopped taking his wife out</i>.

33:07.830 --> 33:10.958
<i>Now he just walks</i>
<i>around the block alone</i>.

33:11.133 --> 33:13.033
<i>I hope she's all right</i>.

33:13.769 --> 33:16.704
<i>On Saturdays, things got a little boring</i>.

33:16.872 --> 33:21.673
''What is the Sea of Galilee called
in the old Testament?''

33:22.144 --> 33:24.908
That's an easy one.
The Sea of Chinnereth.

33:25.448 --> 33:27.109
My turn.

33:28.050 --> 33:30.951
''Was there any money on Noah's Ark?''

33:31.120 --> 33:32.678
-No.
-Wrong.

33:32.855 --> 33:35.187
The duck had a bill,
the skunk had a scent...

33:35.357 --> 33:37.188
...and the frog had a green back.

33:39.929 --> 33:42.523
<i>Listening to Erica's parents</i>
<i>play Biblical Pursuit</i>...

33:42.698 --> 33:45.633
...<i>only strengthened my resolve</i>
<i>to find a way to piss them off</i>...

33:45.801 --> 33:47.268
...<i>and impress my beloved</i>.

33:47.436 --> 33:49.233
<i>I had Giuseppe working on it</i>.

33:49.405 --> 33:50.838
Now pull. And pull.

33:51.006 --> 33:53.770
<i>Some nights were better than others</i>.

33:55.478 --> 33:57.605
All right, ladies, great workout.

33:57.780 --> 33:59.941
okay, great.

34:10.893 --> 34:15.159
<i>But twice a month, I would hear</i>
<i>the most distressing sound I could hear:</i>

34:17.533 --> 34:21.400
<i>The noise of my parents making love</i>.

34:23.072 --> 34:24.801
What's up, Pete?

34:27.243 --> 34:29.507
Hey. Anything come in the mail
for me yet?

34:30.179 --> 34:31.873
Nope.

34:32.614 --> 34:35.982
<i>The guy across the street has found a</i>--
<i>A lady friend</i>.

34:36.150 --> 34:37.675
l'm warning you. Don't do it.

34:37.853 --> 34:40.822
<i>It wasn't until later</i>
<i>that I began to have suspicions</i>...

...<i>as to what the woman</i>
<i>was imploring him not to do</i>.

34:45.261 --> 34:47.126
''Captain Nemo

...and his Herculean companion

34:50.431 --> 34:52.366
Conseil and l walked side by side...

34:52.534 --> 34:57.097
...as if a conversation might still be possible
through our metallic helmets.

35:03.512 --> 35:05.707
Already l no longer felt
the weight of my suit...

35:05.881 --> 35:08.714
...of my lead-soled boots,
of my air tank or of my helmet....''

35:08.884 --> 35:13.014

35:17.159 --> 35:18.990
<i>Finally, in August</i>...

35:19.161 --> 35:20.958
...<i>Erica spoke to me</i>.

35:21.130 --> 35:22.392
Peter?

35:31.040 --> 35:32.166
Erica.

35:33.342 --> 35:35.003
Hi.

35:35.611 --> 35:39.843
l was wondering if maybe
you could help me do something.

35:40.015 --> 35:41.573
Anything.

35:41.750 --> 35:43.377
Well, my parents have grounded me...

35:43.552 --> 35:46.646
...and l really wanna
go see Nick tonight...

35:46.822 --> 35:49.222
...so l was hoping you might
help me get down.

35:51.360 --> 35:52.827
okay.

35:52.995 --> 35:55.987
<i>It was against my principles</i>
<i>to help Erica with Nick</i>...

35:56.165 --> 35:58.463
...<i>but this was at least a way</i>
<i>to talk to her</i>.

35:58.634 --> 36:00.192
<i>And in that short skirt</i>...

36:00.736 --> 36:04.035
...<i>I caught my first glimpse of Xanadu</i>.

36:08.177 --> 36:10.236
My God, are you all right?

36:11.246 --> 36:12.873
l'm-- l'm fine.

36:13.048 --> 36:15.243
<i>''Never better'' was more like it</i>.

36:15.417 --> 36:17.783
-<i>That's how Erica and I began talking</i>.
-l'm so sorry.

36:17.953 --> 36:21.389
<i>Every night she would sneak out</i>
<i>to visit Nick, and I would help her</i>.

36:21.557 --> 36:25.721
<i>And every night, I would find</i>
<i>a new way for Erica to fall on me</i>.

36:30.099 --> 36:31.327
Pussy Galore.

36:31.500 --> 36:33.900
-<i>And we talked</i>.
-She was like this tough chick.

36:34.069 --> 36:35.536
And there is no doubt about it...

36:35.704 --> 36:38.764
...Roger Moore is by far
the best James Bond.

36:38.941 --> 36:41.910
<i>Roger Moore? Come on</i>.

36:42.077 --> 36:44.568
<i>Everybody knows Sean Connery</i>
<i>is the best James Bond</i>.

36:44.747 --> 36:47.272
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

36:47.449 --> 36:49.246
Roger Moore is the best James Bond.

36:49.418 --> 36:51.784
<i>My God, what was I saying?</i>

36:51.954 --> 36:55.014
<i>Erica's beauty had more power</i>
<i>over me than I thought</i>.

36:55.190 --> 36:59.820
l mean, for me, Sean Connery
is just way too hairy.

36:59.995 --> 37:04.864
And it really bugs me the way
he talks like this.

37:05.034 --> 37:08.060
''Where's M, Miss Moneypenny?''

37:08.237 --> 37:10.330
Thank God they never replaced
Desmond Llewelyn.

37:10.506 --> 37:12.474
He is so great as Q.

37:13.342 --> 37:16.402
<i>Erica even knew that</i>
<i>Desmond Llewelyn played Q</i>.

37:16.712 --> 37:17.940
<i>Now I know I'm in love</i>.

37:18.614 --> 37:20.639
This may sound crazy...

37:20.816 --> 37:24.445
...but sometimes when l'm depressed
that the world is a really terrible place...

37:24.620 --> 37:28.317
...l find myself sympathizing
with the Bond villains.

37:28.490 --> 37:30.253
-What do you mean?
-Well...

37:30.426 --> 37:32.917
...remember how Curt Jurgens,
in <i>The Spy Who Loved Me</i>...

37:33.095 --> 37:35.529
...wanted to create a perfect society
under the sea?

37:35.698 --> 37:38.428
And in <i>Moonraker,</i>
Hugo Drax wanted to do the same thing...

37:38.600 --> 37:39.965
-...in space?
-Right.

37:40.135 --> 37:42.228
Well, these guys really weren't so bad.

37:42.404 --> 37:45.669
They were just tired of the war,
the politics, pollution and--

37:45.841 --> 37:47.900
And wanted to change things.

37:48.077 --> 37:50.739
Then this handsome womanizer
who's afraid of commitment...

37:50.913 --> 37:54.542
...pulls up in his fancy sports car
and messes things up...

37:54.717 --> 37:57.550
...just to protect the status quo.

37:57.720 --> 37:59.415
l mean...

37:59.588 --> 38:02.682
...sometimes l wish the world
could just start over, you know?

38:05.227 --> 38:06.956
That's deep.

38:07.129 --> 38:09.825
No, l think the blue M&M's,
they were a good choice.

38:09.998 --> 38:11.192
No way.

38:11.366 --> 38:13.061
<i>I talked to her more in those weeks</i>...

38:13.235 --> 38:16.534
...<i>than I did the previous 1 4 years</i>
<i>I lived across the street from her</i>.

38:16.705 --> 38:20.232
So if you were to be afflicted with
either of the following, which would it be:

38:20.409 --> 38:23.173
Halitosis or incontinence?

38:24.713 --> 38:26.203
Halitosis.

38:26.381 --> 38:29.873
l figure l could always stock up
on breath mints.

38:30.052 --> 38:31.576
okay, l have one for you.

38:31.754 --> 38:34.848
Would you rather lose your eyesight...

38:35.023 --> 38:37.389
...or the use of both of your legs?

38:37.793 --> 38:39.260
-That's too hard.
-No.

38:39.428 --> 38:41.862
Come on. You have to answer.
Those are the rules.

38:42.598 --> 38:45.965
Probably, l'd lose my eyesight.

38:46.135 --> 38:48.899
Your face is etched into my memory.

38:49.071 --> 38:53.371
l'd always be able to see you,
and with my legs...

38:53.542 --> 38:55.840
...l could still make love to you.

39:00.482 --> 39:02.712
Good night, Peter.

39:03.485 --> 39:04.679
Night.

40:11.119 --> 40:12.450
Hey.

40:14.323 --> 40:15.915
What's up?

40:16.925 --> 40:19.325
You promise you're not gonna laugh?

40:19.862 --> 40:21.329
Sure.

40:26.835 --> 40:29.998
-Come on. You said you wouldn't laugh.
-l'm sorry.

40:31.406 --> 40:33.704
-Can l feel?
-Knock it off.

40:34.409 --> 40:36.400
Look, l was trying to
spice up my love life...

40:36.578 --> 40:38.773
...and my parents came home
a little bit early.

40:38.947 --> 40:41.643
They wanted to talk to me
and ended up searching for me.

40:41.817 --> 40:45.685
So l figured the best thing to do
was just get out of the house.

40:46.221 --> 40:48.883
Here, unhook me.

40:49.825 --> 40:51.292
l don't know how girls do this...

40:51.460 --> 40:53.792
...because this thing
was a bitch to get on.

40:54.129 --> 40:55.562
Come on.

40:55.731 --> 40:57.460
Yeah, it's a bitch.

40:57.900 --> 41:00.767
Here. Can you hang on to it
till l can sneak it back in?

41:00.936 --> 41:02.631
And stop smirking.

41:02.804 --> 41:05.432
l'm not the first guy that's tried this.

41:06.575 --> 41:08.975
What does that Kinsey book say about it?

41:12.247 --> 41:15.683
l think maybe you should
give it a rest for a while.

41:15.851 --> 41:18.479
You know, save some for your true love.

41:19.688 --> 41:23.089
Peter, remember that story
we read in seventh grade...

41:23.258 --> 41:26.125
...the one in <i>Scholastic Magazine</i>
about the heroin addict...

41:26.295 --> 41:28.889
...who was so whacked out
that he pulled out his eyeballs?

41:29.264 --> 41:32.165
They said the dude's eyeballs
was hanging down below his knees...

41:32.334 --> 41:34.268
...still attached to his veins
or something.

41:34.436 --> 41:35.562
-Yeah, l remember.
-Yeah.

41:35.737 --> 41:37.227
Well, it wasn't true.

41:37.406 --> 41:39.567
They just printed that to scare us.

41:39.741 --> 41:42.437
Look, it's all propaganda, Pete.

41:42.611 --> 41:44.545
Just like true love is.

41:44.713 --> 41:48.513
You know what?
You and me ain't never gonna find it.

41:52.854 --> 41:56.517
Did you see that 0.3 percent of all males
succeed in self-fellatio?

41:56.692 --> 42:00.150
Have you noticed the guy across the street
never takes his wife out anymore?

42:00.329 --> 42:01.728
No.

42:02.531 --> 42:04.999
Anything come in the mail for me yet?

42:05.167 --> 42:09.103
Remember that weird conversation
we saw him having with that woman?

42:09.271 --> 42:12.536
And she was saying,
''Don't do it. Don't do it.''

42:13.342 --> 42:14.866
Yeah.

42:15.043 --> 42:18.535
Hey, maybe the other woman's
his lover, right?

42:18.714 --> 42:20.648
And he says, ''l'm gonna kill my wife.''

42:20.816 --> 42:24.513
And she says,
''No, don't do it. Don't do it.''

42:24.686 --> 42:26.415
You think?

42:26.922 --> 42:30.517
Well, l know if my wife were an invalid,
l'd be that horny.

42:30.692 --> 42:32.489
You're sick.

42:32.661 --> 42:34.891
Come on, Pete, everybody is.

42:35.063 --> 42:37.395
The question is...

42:38.200 --> 42:41.226
...what's he done with her body?

42:49.578 --> 42:52.342
How exactly would you go about...

42:52.514 --> 42:54.948
...cutting up a dead body?

42:56.118 --> 42:58.211
Well, that's a hacksaw.

42:58.954 --> 43:00.353
Me?

43:01.256 --> 43:02.814
l'd use a chain saw.

43:21.676 --> 43:24.304
<i>The next day, little Robert</i>
<i>decided to take my advice</i>...

43:24.479 --> 43:26.674
...<i>and stand up</i>
<i>to the tyranny of assholes</i>.

43:41.897 --> 43:43.455
<i>Little Robert was all right</i>.

43:43.632 --> 43:46.499
<i>He only needed</i>
<i>40 stitches and two casts</i>.

43:46.668 --> 43:50.661
<i>But I began to wonder whether I should've</i>
<i>tampered with the cosmic order of things</i>.

43:52.374 --> 43:56.310
<i>I was practicing my one-handed technique</i>
<i>when disaster struck</i>.

43:57.679 --> 44:00.204
<i>Nick and Erica had</i>
<i>just come back from the lake</i>.

44:00.949 --> 44:04.680
<i>Unfortunately, Erica's parents</i>
<i>let her out once in a while</i>.

44:06.855 --> 44:09.187
No, come on.
You remember in that one movie.

44:09.357 --> 44:11.723
l mean, that just proves
that Roger Moore...

44:11.893 --> 44:13.758
...is by far the best James Bond.

44:13.929 --> 44:16.397
<i>Erica looked great, of course</i>.

44:16.565 --> 44:19.056
He's all right, l agree he's not bad.

44:19.234 --> 44:23.694
<i>But I nearly hurled</i>
<i>at the sight of Nick in his Speedo</i>.

44:24.439 --> 44:25.736
<i>He was huge!</i>

44:25.907 --> 44:29.365
<i>He immediately makes you think</i>
<i>of the words ''</i> Apollo <i>rocket. ''</i>

44:29.544 --> 44:31.444
<i>How the hell was I gonna</i>
<i>compete with that?</i>

44:31.613 --> 44:36.277
<i>I was India's space program</i>
<i>compared to his Cape Kennedy</i>.

44:36.551 --> 44:39.577
Hey, you brought the protection, right?

44:39.955 --> 44:42.423
<i>The protection?!</i>
<i>Where were her parents?</i>

44:42.924 --> 44:45.324
<i>Where was Christ's vice squad</i>
<i>when I needed them most?</i>

44:45.494 --> 44:46.756
Come in, <i>Apollo 1 2</i>.

44:46.928 --> 44:48.691
We have you cleared for takeoff.

44:48.864 --> 44:52.459
Roger that, mission control.
We are ready for liftoff.

44:53.101 --> 44:55.865
We have liftoff in 1 0, nine--

44:56.037 --> 44:57.368
<i>I had to do something</i>.

44:57.539 --> 45:00.167
<i>I had to abort Nick's trip to Venus</i>.

45:00.342 --> 45:02.037
<i>I did the only thing I could think of</i>.

45:02.210 --> 45:04.007
--two, one.

45:16.024 --> 45:17.582
<i>I don't know why this came to me</i>.

45:17.759 --> 45:20.284
<i>It must have been</i>
<i>a word association with ''come. ''</i>

45:47.355 --> 45:48.913
<i>It seemed to do the trick</i>.

45:49.090 --> 45:50.717
Nick, stop.

45:50.892 --> 45:53.292
<i>Apollo 1 2</i>, we've had a malfunction.

45:53.461 --> 45:54.689
Abort liftoff.

45:56.364 --> 45:58.229
<i>I had visions</i>
<i>that I could take Nick out</i>...

45:58.400 --> 46:00.527
...<i>with my expert knowledge</i>
<i>of the martial arts</i>.

46:06.041 --> 46:07.030
Finish him!

46:07.642 --> 46:09.473
<i>But that's not what happened</i>.

46:11.313 --> 46:14.544
<i>Towering above me, Nick hawked</i>
<i>the biggest loogie ever</i>.

46:14.716 --> 46:17.776
<i>I trembled,</i>
<i>knowing it was intended for me</i>.

46:20.689 --> 46:22.657
oh, my God.

46:23.625 --> 46:25.456
You stuff.

46:26.294 --> 46:27.693
You stuff.

46:35.804 --> 46:37.533
lf you tell anybody, you're dead.

46:48.450 --> 46:50.975
Houston, we have liftoff.

47:12.507 --> 47:15.203
-Dad, what are you doing?
-Having a yard sale.

47:15.377 --> 47:16.844
This is my stuff.

47:17.012 --> 47:19.947
Since you don't live with us anymore,
didn't figure you needed it.

47:20.115 --> 47:22.049
How much for
the Sandy Koufax baseball card?

47:22.217 --> 47:23.445
What, 25 cents?

47:23.618 --> 47:25.882
That's a collector's edition.
lt's worth 50 bucks.

47:26.054 --> 47:27.248
Really?

47:27.422 --> 47:29.686
Twenty-five cents and not a cent less.

47:29.858 --> 47:32.019
-Sold.
-Thanks.

47:35.297 --> 47:37.231
Mom.

47:37.699 --> 47:39.894
oh, how much for
the electric toothbrush?

47:40.068 --> 47:41.933
For you, a special price.

47:42.103 --> 47:44.230
-A buck.
-Yeah.

47:44.406 --> 47:46.271
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

47:47.275 --> 47:48.537
Matt, what are you doing?

47:48.710 --> 47:50.268
l use one of these at my grandma's.

47:50.445 --> 47:53.414
lf you do it right,
feels just like a vibrator.

47:53.581 --> 47:56.778
<i>Figlio,</i> what the hell are you doing
with your boy's things?

47:56.951 --> 48:00.250
-Dad, they're not his things.
-Give you $5 for this collection of <i>Playpen</i>.

48:00.422 --> 48:02.322
-l give you 6!
-You're not a customer.

48:02.490 --> 48:05.015
-You have no right to sell his things!
-Pages are sticky.

48:05.193 --> 48:06.490
-That's disgusting.
-No right!

48:06.661 --> 48:08.959
-okay, 4 bucks.
-Four bucks?

48:09.130 --> 48:10.563
No, no, no. No!

48:10.732 --> 48:13.895
-You have no right! You--
-All right.

48:14.069 --> 48:16.094
-Papa?
-Nonno?

48:16.671 --> 48:18.263
What's the matter?
Are you all right?

48:18.440 --> 48:20.340
-Papa!
-okay. okay.

48:20.508 --> 48:22.135
Give the man some room. Clear out.

48:22.310 --> 48:23.538
<i>Good old Nonno</i>.

48:23.712 --> 48:26.476
<i>He saved the best trick</i>
<i>in his arsenal for now</i>.

48:26.648 --> 48:30.482
<i>He was so convincing, I almost believed</i>
<i>he was having a heart attack</i>.

48:30.652 --> 48:32.916
-Yard sale's over!
-Papa, speak to me!

48:33.088 --> 48:35.784
-Good one, Nonno.
-ls anyone a doctor?

48:35.957 --> 48:38.983
Please, we need some help here!

48:44.532 --> 48:46.523
-l don't know what we can do.
-What's happening?

48:46.701 --> 48:48.259
What is wrong?

48:48.436 --> 48:49.698
-Daddy.
-He's not breathing.

48:49.871 --> 48:51.805
-What do you mean?
-He doesn't have a pulse.

48:51.973 --> 48:53.406
Somebody call 91 1 .

48:53.575 --> 48:55.304
-Somebody call 91 1 !
-Please call 91 1 !

48:55.610 --> 48:58.738
-Nonno.
-Do it now! Hurry! Hurry!

48:58.913 --> 49:00.141
Nonno.

49:01.049 --> 49:02.607
Tell them you're faking. Come on.

49:02.784 --> 49:04.308
-Are you faking, Daddy?
-Come on.

49:04.486 --> 49:05.976
He's not faking. What--? Faking?

49:06.154 --> 49:08.884
Papa-- Papa, speak to me.

49:09.924 --> 49:11.482
oh, no.

49:20.769 --> 49:24.330
<i>I didn't stand under Erica's window</i>
<i>for the next couple of days</i>.

49:24.506 --> 49:26.474
<i>I figured I was allowed</i>.

49:26.641 --> 49:28.973
<i>My dad blamed me</i>
<i>for what happened</i>.

49:29.144 --> 49:32.113
<i>He said if I still decided</i>
<i>to continue with my lunacy</i>...

49:32.280 --> 49:34.441
...<i>he would continue to lock me out</i>.

49:34.616 --> 49:35.981
<i>With an asshole like my dad</i>...

49:36.151 --> 49:39.518
...<i>I'm surprised I didn't inherit</i>
<i>the asshole gene</i>.

49:52.267 --> 49:54.963
ls that what l think it is?

49:57.338 --> 49:58.669
Jesus.

49:58.840 --> 50:03.174
l'm getting excited right after
my grandfather's own funeral.

50:03.344 --> 50:05.471
You must think l'm sick.

50:08.316 --> 50:13.049
l just think it means Nonno's spirit
runs strong in you.

50:25.300 --> 50:28.167
Hey. Brought back
your electric toothbrush.

50:32.140 --> 50:33.368
How thoughtful.

50:33.541 --> 50:37.033
You know, it doesn't vibrate as good
as l thought it would. Here, feel.

50:37.212 --> 50:41.148
No, l'm not touching that,
let alone putting it in my mouth.

50:41.316 --> 50:44.911
-l washed it off. l swear.
-Just keep it.

50:45.086 --> 50:50.388
You're just in a crappy mood because you
realize this Romeo act is a dumb-ass idea.

50:50.725 --> 50:53.353
l haven't decided whether
to give this up yet.

50:53.528 --> 50:57.862
Erica was so sweet today,
you could have poured her over pancakes.

50:59.000 --> 51:02.527
But she hasn't given me any indication
that l have a chance with her.

51:02.704 --> 51:04.001
Well, l'll tell you.

51:04.172 --> 51:06.936
The fact that Nick's giving her
the old Roto-Rooter...

51:07.108 --> 51:09.099
...ain't a good sign.

51:09.277 --> 51:12.974
Nonno was the only one
who thought this was a good idea.

51:13.515 --> 51:17.383
Maybe l should just bite the big one
and call it quits.

51:17.919 --> 51:20.285
Bite away, my friend.

51:22.123 --> 51:23.317
Stop it!

51:23.491 --> 51:26.324
Stop it! Stop!

51:39.674 --> 51:40.902
You see?

51:41.075 --> 51:43.703
Nice guys don't always finish last.

51:45.280 --> 51:47.145
You're not gonna give up now, are you?

51:50.151 --> 51:51.982
-Nope.
-oh, man.

51:52.153 --> 51:55.145
Your grandfather croaking
was your perfect out.

51:57.992 --> 51:59.960
<i>I started reading Casanova</i>.

52:00.128 --> 52:02.995
<i>I didn't know he got syphilis five times</i>.

52:03.164 --> 52:04.825
<i>I should be so lucky</i>.

52:04.999 --> 52:06.523
<i>The excitement of the past days</i>...

52:06.701 --> 52:10.330
...<i>had completely lobotomized me to</i>
<i>what was going on across the street until</i>...

52:10.505 --> 52:12.632
...<i>I saw my man carry out</i>
<i>some suspicious bags</i>...

52:12.807 --> 52:15.776
...<i>and put them in the trunk of his car</i>.

52:37.165 --> 52:40.692
<i>A couple of nights later,</i>
<i>I had an unexpected visitor</i>.

52:41.469 --> 52:43.403
<i>It was Ms. Lewis</i>...

52:43.571 --> 52:46.540
...<i>the pretty divorcÃ©e</i>
<i>from down the street</i>.

52:46.708 --> 52:50.337
<i>Her body was smoldering</i>
<i>like a lit cigarette</i>.

52:53.548 --> 52:55.675
Hello, Peter.

52:56.884 --> 52:58.681
Ms. Lewis.

52:58.853 --> 53:01.822
l was hoping you could cut my grass.

53:03.524 --> 53:05.958
l'm not mowing lawns this year.

53:06.527 --> 53:08.620
l'll make it worth your while.

53:08.796 --> 53:10.354
And...

53:10.531 --> 53:12.931
...you won't have to bag it.

53:14.769 --> 53:16.794
l can't.

53:17.305 --> 53:19.296
What am l to do?

53:20.642 --> 53:25.409
lt needs to be cut at least twice a week.

53:25.580 --> 53:30.176
lt grows so fast.

53:30.351 --> 53:31.613
<i>She was coming on to me</i>.

53:31.786 --> 53:33.310
<i>I was paralyzed</i>.

53:33.488 --> 53:35.115
<i>I didn't know what to do</i>.

53:35.289 --> 53:39.089
<i>Fortunately, I didn't have to do anything</i>.
<i>She did it all</i>.

53:40.595 --> 53:43.155
<i>I thought, ''This might be my chance</i>.

53:43.331 --> 53:47.165
<i>If Erica comes to the balcony and sees me</i>
<i>with another woman, she'll be jealous. ''</i>

53:47.635 --> 53:49.967
Stay away from him. He's my man.

53:50.138 --> 53:53.505
<i>Then I had a fear that Erica was</i>
<i>the type of girl who would enjoy watching</i>.

53:55.810 --> 53:57.869
<i>I decided to put my all into it</i>.

53:58.046 --> 54:01.846
<i>If Erica saw how good I was,</i>
<i>she would want me even more</i>.

54:04.485 --> 54:08.182
<i>But I also worried she might be as harsh on</i>
<i>my performance as an East German judge</i>.

54:10.458 --> 54:13.018
<i>What was I doing?</i>
<i>If Erica sees me like this</i>...

54:13.194 --> 54:15.992
...<i>I would jeopardize all</i>
<i>I had worked for all summer</i>.

54:16.164 --> 54:20.032
<i>I had to stop, but Ms. Lewis was</i>
<i>most persuasive</i>.

54:20.201 --> 54:21.896
<i>How could I tell her no now?</i>

54:22.070 --> 54:26.336
<i>I tried to think of anything</i>
<i>other than sex</i>.

54:36.818 --> 54:38.649
What happened?

54:42.924 --> 54:44.824
l don't know.

54:44.992 --> 54:48.450
Maybe now's not a good time.

54:48.629 --> 54:50.392
Perhaps it's....

54:50.565 --> 54:54.262
Perhaps it's because l've been trying
to get this girl to notice me.

54:55.636 --> 54:58.104
Yes, l know.

54:59.006 --> 55:02.464
l know all about it.
lt's what makes you so exciting.

55:04.112 --> 55:06.080
l'm sorry.

55:11.419 --> 55:13.080
Hey!

55:16.991 --> 55:18.185
What happened to you?

55:18.359 --> 55:21.726
l tried to become part
of that 0.3 percent.

55:23.064 --> 55:24.725
What do you mean?

55:27.301 --> 55:29.565
Your Kinsey reports.

55:29.737 --> 55:32.797
l tried to suck myself off
and l hurt my neck.

55:32.974 --> 55:35.636
Now l gotta wear this stupid thing.

55:36.377 --> 55:39.710
-Hey, anything come in the mail for me yet?
-Nope.

55:39.881 --> 55:41.815
What's the matter with you?

55:42.717 --> 55:44.082
Nothing.

55:44.252 --> 55:45.719
Something's wrong.

55:45.887 --> 55:47.286
Nothing's wrong.

55:47.455 --> 55:49.650
Yes, there is.

55:49.824 --> 55:51.291
See...

55:51.459 --> 55:55.987
...normally, you would have asked me
if l succeeded in my venture of self-fellatio.

55:56.164 --> 55:58.155
But you didn't ask that.

55:59.400 --> 56:01.265
Well, did you?

56:01.435 --> 56:04.893
l will only tell you
when you tell me what's wrong.

56:07.942 --> 56:09.307
okay.

56:09.477 --> 56:10.910
l succeeded.

56:11.078 --> 56:13.046
-No, you didn't.
-Yeah.

56:13.214 --> 56:14.579
only for a second, though...

56:14.749 --> 56:17.513
...before l snapped something
in my neck.

56:17.685 --> 56:20.347
Did you know it tastes like roast beef?

56:20.521 --> 56:22.489
Which l actually found reassuring.

56:22.657 --> 56:25.421
See, l always thought that
girls must hate giving head...

56:25.593 --> 56:29.529
...but if you think about it,
it's kind of like a trip to the Sizzler.

56:30.698 --> 56:32.723
Come on, tell me what's bothering you.

56:34.335 --> 56:36.394
l'm running out of time.

56:36.571 --> 56:38.630
Erica leaves for college
in a couple of weeks.

56:38.806 --> 56:40.831
l'm beginning to think
this isn't gonna work.

56:41.008 --> 56:43.169
She probably thinks l'm
even more of a schmuck.

56:43.344 --> 56:44.777
Yeah, well, l told you so.

56:44.946 --> 56:47.210
l don't need to hear that from you.

56:47.381 --> 56:49.474
You're supposed to be my friend.

56:49.650 --> 56:52.676
l was just trying to give you
some good advice.

56:52.854 --> 56:54.378
Advice.

56:55.022 --> 56:56.956
Why would l take advice from a guy...

56:57.124 --> 57:00.389
...who broke his neck
trying to suck his own dick?

57:00.561 --> 57:02.791
Because l am enterprising.

57:05.132 --> 57:08.568
<i>There was one thing I hadn't tried yet</i>
<i>to become Erica's love slave</i>...

57:08.736 --> 57:11.569
...<i>and that was impressing her</i>
<i>by pissing her parents off</i>.

57:11.739 --> 57:14.037
<i>Giuseppe had been working on a plan</i>.

57:14.208 --> 57:16.608

57:17.378 --> 57:18.902
<i>Finally it presented itself</i>.

57:19.413 --> 57:23.645
<i>Erica's father and his friends were</i>
<i>competing for some Easter pageant contest</i>.

57:23.818 --> 57:25.479
<i>One where 1 2 guys in bed sheets</i>...

57:25.653 --> 57:29.453
...<i>hold a pose of Leonardo da Vinci's</i>
Last Supper <i>for over five minutes</i>.

57:29.624 --> 57:31.922
<i>The team with the best tableau</i>
<i>gets to perform it</i>...

57:32.093 --> 57:35.256
...<i>at the National Cathedral</i>
<i>for the president or something</i>.

57:37.899 --> 57:39.799
Darn it, Phil. You moved.

57:39.967 --> 57:42.197
l couldn't help it. l had an itch.

57:42.370 --> 57:44.497
We were only two minutes
and 1 3 seconds into it.

57:44.672 --> 57:48.472
We're gonna have to hold it twice that long
if we stand any chance to win this thing.

57:48.643 --> 57:51.373
lt's easy for you.
You get to rest your elbows on the table.

57:51.545 --> 57:53.877
Try holding your arms out
like this for five minutes.

57:54.048 --> 57:56.573
-lt's not that hard.
-Yeah? Then you try it.

57:56.751 --> 57:59.083
Why do you get to be Jesus every year?

57:59.387 --> 58:02.288
Because l organize this thing.
l'm the leader.

58:02.456 --> 58:04.185
l'm tired of playing Judas
all the time.

58:04.358 --> 58:06.519
Come on, Phil. You make a great Judas.

58:08.095 --> 58:09.722
What is that supposed to mean?

58:11.565 --> 58:14.125
And where do you think
you're going, young lady?

58:14.302 --> 58:16.702
Nick got tickets to Lollapalooza,
so we're going.

58:16.871 --> 58:19.533
Well, don't you remember?
l banned you from going out.

58:19.707 --> 58:21.607
Can't you make an exception
this one time?

58:21.776 --> 58:23.471
No! You're not leaving this house.

58:23.644 --> 58:26.408
Dad, what are you talking about?
This is not fair!

58:26.881 --> 58:28.746
lt is time, my friend.

58:28.916 --> 58:31.976
-You're treating me like l'm 1 0!
-You're acting like you're 1 0!

58:32.153 --> 58:34.417
Now, l don't enjoy doing this,
but it is my resp--

58:34.588 --> 58:37.216
Let her go, or the baby Jesus gets it.

58:38.225 --> 58:39.920
Peter. Wha--?

58:40.394 --> 58:41.759
l mean it.

58:46.600 --> 58:50.058
l cannot have you desecrate
the baby Jesus.

58:52.173 --> 58:53.731
All right, Erica.

58:53.908 --> 58:55.569
You may go.

59:00.948 --> 59:02.540
Now give him to me.

59:02.717 --> 59:06.676
l'll give him back at the end of the summer,
when Erica leaves for college.

59:06.854 --> 59:09.049
lt's not fair you keep her
locked up in here.

59:09.223 --> 59:11.248
Why, you-- Get him!

59:24.438 --> 59:26.235
So how do you think Jesus
really feels...

59:26.407 --> 59:29.399
...about having his name
on all those bumper stickers?

59:38.719 --> 59:41.882
So my father's pretty pissed.

59:42.923 --> 59:44.254
Yeah.

59:47.028 --> 59:49.360
You didn't have to do that, you know.

59:51.632 --> 59:53.429
l wanted to.

59:56.203 --> 59:57.727
Thanks.

01:00:07.748 --> 01:00:09.773
Well, good night.

01:00:20.928 --> 01:00:23.522
What? She only gave you
a peck on the cheek...

01:00:23.697 --> 01:00:25.096
...after what you did for her?

01:00:25.266 --> 01:00:27.063
l know. What does that mean?

01:00:27.234 --> 01:00:28.701
l'll tell you what it means.

01:00:28.869 --> 01:00:32.771
lt means you ain't never gonna make
the beast with two backs with her, friend.

01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:35.170
l don't know.
We've been talking a lot lately.

01:00:35.576 --> 01:00:37.806
Yeah, sure. You're in the friend zone.

01:00:37.978 --> 01:00:40.674
-ls that bad?
-Bad? lt's the worst.

01:00:40.848 --> 01:00:42.440
Come on. Girls don't want a friend.

01:00:42.616 --> 01:00:44.584
They want a human piston.

01:00:44.752 --> 01:00:49.280
Well, maybe l still got a chance at becoming
her ''human piston,'' as you put it.

01:00:49.457 --> 01:00:50.822
We're not that good of friends.

01:00:50.991 --> 01:00:53.516
Are you kidding me?
You're doing life in the friend zone.

01:00:53.694 --> 01:00:56.629
-You think so?
-l know so.

01:01:03.003 --> 01:01:07.440
So, what's up with our psycho killer
over there across the street?

01:01:07.608 --> 01:01:12.102
Well, l snuck over there the other night
to take a peek at what he was up to.

01:01:12.279 --> 01:01:15.271
-He nearly caught me.
-See, l told you. l knew it.

01:01:15.449 --> 01:01:17.713
-The guy's nuts.
-l'm not so sure.

01:01:18.319 --> 01:01:22.050
Past couple of nights l've seen him take
garbage bags out filled with something.

01:01:22.223 --> 01:01:25.386
Bet you he's taking his wife out
piece by piece.

01:01:25.559 --> 01:01:27.959
lt's a lot of bags for just one person.

01:01:28.129 --> 01:01:30.256
Maybe he's taking out
his whole family.

01:01:30.431 --> 01:01:32.922
l know l've thought about it myself.

01:01:33.367 --> 01:01:35.232
l don't think he has any family.

01:01:36.437 --> 01:01:37.461
lt's here, man.

01:01:37.938 --> 01:01:39.371
-There you go.
-Yes, it's here!

01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:42.407
-Look, dude, it's finally here!
-What's finally here?

01:01:42.576 --> 01:01:44.373
lt's an orgasmatron.

01:01:44.545 --> 01:01:46.035
l ordered it in <i>Shaved</i> magazine.

01:01:46.213 --> 01:01:47.703
Check it out. See?

01:01:47.882 --> 01:01:50.043
lt runs on battery or AC.

01:01:50.217 --> 01:01:52.310
lt's a new era, Pete.

01:01:52.486 --> 01:01:55.478
You know they have a name now
for electronic sex?

01:01:55.656 --> 01:01:57.988
-What's that?
-''Dildonics.''

01:01:58.159 --> 01:01:59.592
Pretty cool.

01:02:01.028 --> 01:02:03.394
Dildonics.

01:02:03.564 --> 01:02:06.362
lt kind of makes you sound like a homo.

01:02:08.769 --> 01:02:10.794
l never thought of it like that.

01:02:10.971 --> 01:02:14.065
Anyway, it's a bold new frontier, man.

01:02:14.241 --> 01:02:16.675
l'll let you borrow it any time you want.

01:02:23.484 --> 01:02:24.815
That's okay.

01:02:24.985 --> 01:02:27.180
Listen, with the way
things are going with you...

01:02:27.354 --> 01:02:30.585
...you may wanna consider
my plan of self-sufficiency.

01:02:35.462 --> 01:02:38.295
<i>The friend zone had</i>
<i>an incredible hold on me</i>.

01:02:38.465 --> 01:02:41.366
<i>I couldn't escape its hellish grasp</i>.

01:02:41.535 --> 01:02:44.993
So who would you rather be:
Paul McCartney or John Lennon?

01:02:45.172 --> 01:02:46.969
That's obvious. John Lennon.

01:02:47.141 --> 01:02:48.608
Yeah, but you'd be dead now.

01:02:48.776 --> 01:02:51.870
So what? At least l'd be
the coolest of all the Beatles.

01:02:52.446 --> 01:02:55.745
l don't know. He did marry Yoko ono.

01:02:55.916 --> 01:02:59.443
People underestimate Paul McCartney.
He's written some pretty good music.

01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:01.645
Like ''Ebony and lvory''?

01:03:02.790 --> 01:03:04.849
okay. You're right.

01:03:05.025 --> 01:03:07.892
You know, l don't think it'd be so hard
being a songwriter.

01:03:08.062 --> 01:03:10.223
-oh, yeah?
-l mean, if you're a novelist...

01:03:10.397 --> 01:03:12.661
...you have to come up with
every sentence, every word.

01:03:12.833 --> 01:03:15.859
lf you're a businessman,
your reports have to be well-thought-out...

01:03:16.036 --> 01:03:19.301
-...with sound financial conclusions, right?
-Right.

01:03:19.473 --> 01:03:22.840
But if you're a songwriter, and you can't
figure out how to end a song...

01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:25.035
...you just fade out.

01:03:25.212 --> 01:03:26.372
lt's easy.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:28.307
Yeah. You're right.

01:03:28.482 --> 01:03:32.248
What other job lets you finish it up
by just fading out?

01:03:32.886 --> 01:03:34.581
A film director.

01:03:40.227 --> 01:03:42.127
<i>So it went on like this</i>.

01:03:42.296 --> 01:03:46.426
<i>Maybe Erica was right</i>.
<i>We were just friends</i>.

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:50.001
You never told me. What's the worst thing
your parents ever did to you?

01:03:50.337 --> 01:03:52.430
l guess the worst thing
my dad ever did...

01:03:52.606 --> 01:03:55.905
...was speak at career day
to my third-grade class.

01:03:56.076 --> 01:04:00.274
He talked for over half an hour
about the joys of being a radiologist...

01:04:00.447 --> 01:04:05.077
...and then proceeded to treat
the entire class to a chocolate barium.

01:04:05.252 --> 01:04:06.981
That's bad.

01:04:08.555 --> 01:04:09.647
So, what about you?

01:04:10.758 --> 01:04:13.192
lt must have been the time l was 5.

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:16.124
My dad and l were at
the Lighthouse Christian Store.

01:04:16.297 --> 01:04:18.094
lt was January...

01:04:18.265 --> 01:04:20.233
...and he was buying Christmas cards.

01:04:20.401 --> 01:04:23.199
He always does that.
Buys Christmas cards in January...

01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:25.770
...when the previous year's selection
go on sale.

01:04:25.939 --> 01:04:27.770
Anyway, l had just learned to count.

01:04:27.941 --> 01:04:29.465
So l was always counting things...

01:04:29.643 --> 01:04:33.044
...like the number of stop lights
on the way to the store, stuff like that.

01:04:33.213 --> 01:04:35.704
When the cashier gave my dad
his change back...

01:04:35.883 --> 01:04:38.875
...l had noticed that she'd given him
the wrong amount.

01:04:39.053 --> 01:04:41.783
She'd given him too much.

01:04:41.955 --> 01:04:45.391
And l looked up at my dad,
and he had noticed too.

01:04:45.559 --> 01:04:46.821
But he didn't do anything.

01:04:47.628 --> 01:04:51.291
He just took the money
and put it in his wallet, and we left.

01:04:53.167 --> 01:04:55.499
lt was right then, l guess...

01:04:55.669 --> 01:04:59.264
...that l stopped believing
my parents were perfect people.

01:05:02.543 --> 01:05:04.135
Well...

01:05:04.611 --> 01:05:06.340
...good night, Peter.

01:05:09.583 --> 01:05:10.948
Night.

01:05:12.853 --> 01:05:17.313
<i>If Erica had lost all trust in her parents,</i>
<i>how could she trust anything?</i>

01:05:18.025 --> 01:05:20.425
<i>How could she trust that I loved her?</i>

01:05:20.794 --> 01:05:23.319
<i>I was beginning to think Matt was right</i>.

01:05:23.497 --> 01:05:26.125
<i>I had tried everything</i>
<i>to win over my beloved Erica</i>...

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:28.825
...<i>but nothing had worked</i>.
<i>Nothing was going to work</i>.

01:05:29.002 --> 01:05:31.027
<i>It had only stranded me</i>
<i>in the friend zone</i>...

01:05:31.205 --> 01:05:34.174
...<i>like Charlton Heston being marooned</i>
<i>in the</i> Planet of the Apes.

01:05:34.341 --> 01:05:36.809
<i>I was so unhappy,</i>
<i>whereas my best bud, Matt</i>...

01:05:36.977 --> 01:05:40.674
...<i>had fallen in love with a robot</i>
<i>which gives blowjobs</i>.

01:05:42.216 --> 01:05:45.879
<i>Maybe I was the strange one, not him</i>.
<i>At least he was happy</i>.

01:05:48.188 --> 01:05:51.123
My dick! My dick!

01:06:23.290 --> 01:06:25.224
Here, you try.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:27.588
lt's silly.

01:06:27.761 --> 01:06:30.025
So? lt's fun.
lt'll make you feel like a kid again.

01:06:30.197 --> 01:06:31.994
Now, go on.

01:06:32.166 --> 01:06:33.394
That's it.

01:06:33.867 --> 01:06:36.495
Go, have fun.

01:07:31.825 --> 01:07:34.293
You know,
everybody thinks you're crazy.

01:07:34.461 --> 01:07:36.053
So what?

01:07:37.364 --> 01:07:38.763
Well....

01:07:38.932 --> 01:07:41.457
l mean, you gotta admit,
you do some pretty weird things.

01:07:41.635 --> 01:07:43.569
l don't think so.

01:07:44.872 --> 01:07:46.533
Well...

01:07:46.974 --> 01:07:50.375
...explain why you sometimes
go out to your car and eat dinner.

01:07:50.544 --> 01:07:53.513
My car radio gets better reception
than the one on my stereo.

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:56.376
l go out there to listen to my opera.

01:07:58.785 --> 01:08:01.253
What about doing your gardening
in a scuba mask?

01:08:01.421 --> 01:08:05.016
l love to garden,
but l'm allergic to pollen.

01:08:05.192 --> 01:08:09.788
lt's the only way l can work in the yard
without having my eyes all tear up.

01:08:12.032 --> 01:08:14.227
okay. But admit it.

01:08:14.401 --> 01:08:17.198
Cutting your grass
in the middle of the night?

01:08:17.371 --> 01:08:18.736
lt's a little strange.

01:08:18.906 --> 01:08:20.533
With this humidity?

01:08:20.707 --> 01:08:23.505
Nighttime's the only sane time
to cut the grass.

01:08:24.144 --> 01:08:26.510
What about sitting on your roof
with the telephone?

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:27.977
oh, that.

01:08:29.015 --> 01:08:33.282
My best friend, Mabel, lives
just a couple of blocks away from here.

01:08:34.854 --> 01:08:38.018
She's going senile,
but she won't admit it...

01:08:38.191 --> 01:08:40.853
...and she insists on driving her car.

01:08:41.028 --> 01:08:43.258
So when she's coming over to visit...

01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:45.761
...l go up on my roof.

01:08:46.233 --> 01:08:48.861
l can see her back out of her driveway.

01:08:49.036 --> 01:08:50.765
And if she makes a wrong turn...

01:08:50.938 --> 01:08:53.406
...l call her on her car phone,
give her directions.

01:08:53.573 --> 01:08:55.269
voilÃ .

01:08:58.345 --> 01:09:01.837
-lt all makes sense.
-Everything does.

01:09:02.983 --> 01:09:06.042
Just depends on your perspective.

01:09:09.622 --> 01:09:11.818
This is the worst day of my life.

01:09:11.992 --> 01:09:14.893
The orgasmatron shorted out on me.

01:09:15.062 --> 01:09:17.359
Gave my penis an electric shock.

01:09:17.531 --> 01:09:18.862
You didn't like that?

01:09:19.032 --> 01:09:20.522
No, you don't understand, okay?

01:09:20.701 --> 01:09:23.295
l can't get it up anymore.
lt doesn't work.

01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:25.438
Just leave it alone for a little while.

01:09:25.606 --> 01:09:27.470
l'm sure it just needs a little R and R.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:29.006
Yeah, l know. l tried that.

01:09:29.176 --> 01:09:31.167
l waited all morning
and then tried it again.

01:09:31.345 --> 01:09:32.903
lt still doesn't work.

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.604
l couldn't even get it to go to half-mast.

01:09:36.183 --> 01:09:37.582
Hey, what if you're right?

01:09:37.751 --> 01:09:40.720
What if a guy only has
a finite number of erections...

01:09:40.886 --> 01:09:43.117
...and l've used all mine up?

01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:44.886
Well, what are you gonna do?

01:09:45.459 --> 01:09:48.553
l do have an emergency plan
for such an event...

01:09:48.729 --> 01:09:51.788
...but l'm gonna need your help.

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:56.899
No way, man. lt's too weird for me.

01:09:57.070 --> 01:09:58.731
Come on, man.

01:09:58.905 --> 01:10:00.600
Look, it's nothing like that, okay?

01:10:02.109 --> 01:10:05.510
l got some money saved up,
and there's this lady on the boulevard.

01:10:05.679 --> 01:10:09.012
Let's just say she's an experienced lady.

01:10:09.316 --> 01:10:12.114
For 1 00 bucks,
she'll do it any way you want.

01:10:12.285 --> 01:10:13.616
What do you need me for?

01:10:13.787 --> 01:10:16.187
l can't do this alone.
l need you to go with me.

01:10:16.356 --> 01:10:18.381
Now, l got 1 50 saved up.

01:10:18.558 --> 01:10:20.788
Hey, we could work a two-for-one deal.

01:10:21.161 --> 01:10:22.719
No way.

01:10:22.896 --> 01:10:24.420
Come on, man.

01:10:24.598 --> 01:10:26.327
l'll even take sloppy seconds.

01:10:30.103 --> 01:10:32.264
Just forget it.

01:10:32.439 --> 01:10:35.067
l've only got a few days left
to win Erica's love.

01:10:35.242 --> 01:10:37.802
Even if she doesn't fall in love with me...

01:10:37.978 --> 01:10:40.708
...l've decided to stick it out
until the end of the summer.

01:10:40.881 --> 01:10:42.815
That way, l know l've tried everything.

01:10:42.983 --> 01:10:44.678
Please, man.

01:10:45.452 --> 01:10:47.181
Come on, man. lt's an emergency.

01:10:47.354 --> 01:10:49.447
l need your help.

01:10:50.023 --> 01:10:52.014
l can't.

01:10:52.192 --> 01:10:54.490
What kind of friend are you?

01:10:54.661 --> 01:10:57.061
l mean, you've spent
our last great summer together...

01:10:57.230 --> 01:10:59.164
...standing under
some stupid girl's window.

01:10:59.332 --> 01:11:02.324
And do l say a word about it to you?
No, not once.

01:11:02.502 --> 01:11:04.060
But then, when l need you...

01:11:04.237 --> 01:11:06.671
...in the middle of the biggest crisis
in my life...

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:08.865
...you don't even consider it?

01:11:09.042 --> 01:11:10.669
You're a dickwad, you know that?

01:11:10.844 --> 01:11:13.779
Yeah. No wonder Erica doesn't like you.

01:11:14.881 --> 01:11:16.872
-Take it back.
-No.

01:11:17.050 --> 01:11:18.517
No. You know what?

01:11:18.685 --> 01:11:21.449
You're a asswipe,
and she's never gonna love you.

01:11:21.621 --> 01:11:22.610
-Take it back!
-No!

01:11:22.789 --> 01:11:24.188
-Come on!
-Yeah. Take it back.

01:11:24.357 --> 01:11:25.381
-No!
-Yeah. Yeah.

01:11:25.559 --> 01:11:27.117
Come here.

01:11:27.294 --> 01:11:30.286
My neck, man!
Come on, my neck. Get off!

01:11:34.901 --> 01:11:36.425
Pretty stupid too, pal.

01:11:37.604 --> 01:11:39.196
<i>Maybe I was stupid</i>.

01:11:39.372 --> 01:11:41.499
<i>That afternoon, my dad gave me proof</i>...

01:11:41.675 --> 01:11:44.041
...<i>that I had inherited this trait from him</i>.

01:11:44.211 --> 01:11:46.543
<i>I had just finished Casanova</i>
<i>and had begun reading</i>...

01:11:46.713 --> 01:11:50.479
...<i>the love poems of Robert Browning,</i>
<i>and his wife, Elizabeth Barrett Browning</i>.

01:11:50.650 --> 01:11:51.810
<i>She's the one who wrote:</i>

01:11:51.985 --> 01:11:54.613
''How do l love thee?
Let me count the ways.''

01:11:54.788 --> 01:11:56.779
<i>Anyway, it was my parents' anniversary</i>...

01:11:56.957 --> 01:12:00.085
...<i>and my father made the mistake</i>
<i>of getting the wrong gift</i>.

01:12:07.868 --> 01:12:09.233
l'm sorry, honey.

01:12:15.242 --> 01:12:19.042
<i>My dad tried to salvage the situation</i>
<i>by rushing out to the jewelry store</i>.

01:12:21.047 --> 01:12:22.776
<i>But that wasn't enough</i>.

01:12:23.116 --> 01:12:27.177
<i>When he came home,</i>
<i>he was in for a big surprise</i>.

01:12:43.136 --> 01:12:46.071
Honey, come on. Let me in. Please?

01:12:47.808 --> 01:12:50.777
Sweetheart?
l got you another present. See?

01:13:11.898 --> 01:13:13.957
May l join you?

01:13:18.338 --> 01:13:20.203
Guess so.

01:13:41.328 --> 01:13:43.421
<i>I always thought</i>
<i>my dad was pretty lame</i>.

01:13:43.964 --> 01:13:46.125
<i>What did it say about me</i>
<i>that my dad was using</i>...

01:13:46.299 --> 01:13:50.167
...<i>my strategy to win Erica</i>
<i>to score points with Mom?</i>

01:13:53.907 --> 01:13:56.102
<i>I hoped my dad would have</i>
<i>more luck with my mom</i>...

01:13:56.276 --> 01:13:58.267
...<i>than I was having with Erica</i>.

01:13:58.445 --> 01:14:01.278
.<i>He was beginning to get on my nerves</i>.

01:14:04.584 --> 01:14:06.643
You ever tried that one on Mom?

01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:08.515
No.

01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:12.187
How about that?

01:14:13.193 --> 01:14:14.455
No.

01:14:16.396 --> 01:14:19.797
You've been married 1 8 years,
you haven't tried that?

01:14:20.967 --> 01:14:23.060
Well, that area's a big mystery to me.

01:14:23.236 --> 01:14:25.431
l've never been able to figure it out.

01:14:25.605 --> 01:14:28.403
Well, no wonder she's so mad at you.

01:14:29.075 --> 01:14:31.236
Do you really think she wants that?

01:14:32.679 --> 01:14:35.876
of course she does.
You read what the book says.

01:14:45.158 --> 01:14:46.853
Thanks, Peter.

01:15:54.561 --> 01:15:56.529
<i>Jesus Christ</i>.

01:15:56.696 --> 01:16:00.325
<i>Now even my dad was</i>
<i>getting more action than I was</i>.

01:16:35.168 --> 01:16:36.692
Hey-ho, Peter.

01:16:40.907 --> 01:16:44.502
-What's this?
-This is breakfast.

01:16:48.314 --> 01:16:49.679
But l thought that--

01:16:49.849 --> 01:16:52.750
Look, l was all wrong about all this.

01:16:52.919 --> 01:16:54.750
l'm very sorry.

01:16:54.921 --> 01:16:57.481
And here's a copy of the house key.

01:16:57.657 --> 01:17:00.717
You can come back inside
anytime you want.

01:17:07.467 --> 01:17:09.230
Thanks.

01:17:09.402 --> 01:17:11.336
And, son...

01:17:13.306 --> 01:17:14.534
...l love you.

01:17:18.211 --> 01:17:20.475
You know the sad man
across the street?

01:17:20.647 --> 01:17:24.014
The one who pushes his wife around
in the wheelchair all the time?

01:17:24.184 --> 01:17:28.018
Well, l don't see her
around there anymore.

01:17:28.188 --> 01:17:30.554
Like she's-- She's gone.

01:17:30.723 --> 01:17:34.022
l've been watching him all summer,
and secretly he's been taking things...

01:17:34.194 --> 01:17:36.128
...in and out of the house.

01:17:36.296 --> 01:17:39.197
Wait. So you think he killed his wife?

01:17:39.365 --> 01:17:40.525
Yeah.

01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:42.668
That's bull.

01:17:42.836 --> 01:17:44.201
l don't believe that.

01:17:44.370 --> 01:17:45.598
Yeah?

01:17:45.772 --> 01:17:49.264
Well, why don't you go over there
and check it out.

01:17:49.442 --> 01:17:53.242
Because l got better things to do
than prowl around some guy's back yard.

01:17:53.413 --> 01:17:54.710
l dare you to go.

01:17:54.881 --> 01:17:56.644
oh, l'm not going over there.

01:17:56.816 --> 01:17:59.751
-l almost got caught last time.
-l dare you both.

01:18:02.088 --> 01:18:03.555
Look, we'll all go.

01:18:05.725 --> 01:18:07.317
<i>So we crossed the street</i>...

01:18:07.494 --> 01:18:10.088
...<i>to find out what happened</i>
<i>to the man's wife</i>...

01:18:10.263 --> 01:18:13.630
...<i>making sure we didn't get run over</i>
<i>by Mister Mays</i>.

01:18:15.268 --> 01:18:17.759
-lt's locked. Come on.
-Erica, wait.

01:18:22.342 --> 01:18:23.934
No, don't open the door. Don't.

01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:25.304
lt's unlocked.

01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:33.145
l knew you'd come back.

01:18:33.319 --> 01:18:35.947
You wanna see what's inside?

01:18:36.389 --> 01:18:38.380
Wanna see what l've done?

01:18:40.059 --> 01:18:42.186
l'll show you what l've done.

01:18:49.502 --> 01:18:51.970
-No, no!
-No, man!

01:18:58.411 --> 01:19:00.140
You've been waiting all summer long.

01:19:00.313 --> 01:19:02.076
-Just relax.
-No, we haven't.

01:19:03.082 --> 01:19:05.949
Let's go, Peter.
Come on! We didn't do anything!

01:19:17.864 --> 01:19:19.297
This.

01:19:19.465 --> 01:19:20.796
This is what l've done.

01:19:20.967 --> 01:19:24.027
You built a swimming pool
in your living room?

01:19:24.204 --> 01:19:26.604
No. Not just a swimming pool.

01:19:29.609 --> 01:19:31.668
l built paradise.

01:19:31.844 --> 01:19:33.744
A tropical...

01:19:33.913 --> 01:19:35.938
...paradise.

01:19:37.951 --> 01:19:39.043
Honey?

01:19:40.753 --> 01:19:44.154
-What's going on?
-Nothing, my dear.

01:19:44.324 --> 01:19:46.224
Just some guests.

01:19:47.961 --> 01:19:50.122
My wife and l...

01:19:51.531 --> 01:19:56.059
...wanted to go back to Tahiti
for our second honeymoon.

01:19:57.604 --> 01:19:59.231
But then...

01:19:59.872 --> 01:20:02.033
...she got so sick.

01:20:03.643 --> 01:20:07.010
She really loved the water, you see.

01:20:08.681 --> 01:20:12.139
l wanted to build a pool
in our back yard...

01:20:13.386 --> 01:20:17.049
...but the city wouldn't give me
the permit in time.

01:20:18.591 --> 01:20:19.853
So...

01:20:20.493 --> 01:20:23.121
...l built it here.

01:20:23.763 --> 01:20:25.321
ln secret.

01:20:26.699 --> 01:20:28.394
For her.

01:20:29.736 --> 01:20:32.261
So that my love and l...

01:20:33.406 --> 01:20:36.136
...can go back to paradise.

01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:43.174
You won't tell anyone, will you?

01:20:45.885 --> 01:20:49.150
<i>Where the apple reddens</i>
<i>Never pry</i>--

01:20:49.555 --> 01:20:52.922
<i>Lest we lose our Edens</i>
<i>Eve and I</i>

01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:09.107
Hi.

01:21:09.976 --> 01:21:11.409
Hi.

01:21:12.679 --> 01:21:14.112
So listen...

01:21:14.547 --> 01:21:16.481
...l'm leaving tomorrow.

01:21:18.251 --> 01:21:19.809
Where you going?

01:21:20.687 --> 01:21:23.178
You're not gonna believe this...

01:21:23.823 --> 01:21:26.291
...but l decided l'm gonna go to college.

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:30.158
Right. Good.

01:21:30.330 --> 01:21:32.355
Erica's leaving for college too.

01:21:34.967 --> 01:21:36.798
Where is she?

01:21:36.969 --> 01:21:39.938
She's with Nick. He broke his leg.

01:21:40.106 --> 01:21:42.097
-Too bad.
-Yeah.

01:21:42.275 --> 01:21:43.936
Lost his football scholarship.

01:21:44.110 --> 01:21:47.011
Like l said, too bad.

01:21:51.351 --> 01:21:55.151
So l guess l won't be seeing you around.

01:21:56.122 --> 01:21:58.090
No, no.

01:21:58.257 --> 01:21:59.918
l guess not.

01:22:03.463 --> 01:22:05.158
Peter, listen.

01:22:06.466 --> 01:22:08.991
l was kind of hoping that...

01:22:09.168 --> 01:22:12.001
...we could spend
my last day here together.

01:22:12.171 --> 01:22:15.572
Elliot's having this party and l thought,
you know, maybe we could go.

01:22:17.076 --> 01:22:19.237
Sounds good.

01:22:19.712 --> 01:22:22.704
But what if Erica, you know...?

01:22:22.882 --> 01:22:24.577
Erica.

01:22:25.184 --> 01:22:27.982
Well, l'll-- l'll see you.

01:22:33.793 --> 01:22:35.385
Screw Erica.

01:22:38.264 --> 01:22:39.492
What?

01:22:39.665 --> 01:22:43.192
l said, screw Erica.

01:22:44.404 --> 01:22:48.397
l mean, if she's not willing to give me
a chance by now, then she's nuts.

01:22:48.574 --> 01:22:52.442
No other man would go through
what l did for her.

01:22:53.012 --> 01:22:56.209
lf that love isn't good enough for her,
well, so be it.

01:22:56.382 --> 01:22:58.475
l mean, there are plenty of other...

01:22:58.651 --> 01:23:02.451
...beautiful, mature women
that want me.

01:23:03.022 --> 01:23:07.152
l even passed up a night
with Ms. Lewis for Erica.

01:23:07.727 --> 01:23:10.093
You passed up Melon-Breast Lewis?

01:23:10.263 --> 01:23:14.063
lf she doesn't love me by now,
then l don't love her.

01:23:14.233 --> 01:23:18.135
Besides, she even thinks
Roger Moore is the best James Bond.

01:23:20.506 --> 01:23:23.031
-Come on. Let's go.
-All right.

01:23:25.311 --> 01:23:30.248
So listen. Did l tell you l revised
my theory on self-sufficiency?

01:23:30.416 --> 01:23:32.941
l'm against it now. lt's a little lonely.

01:23:36.989 --> 01:23:38.217
Peter?

01:23:38.391 --> 01:23:41.258
Peter, l need to talk to you.

01:23:41.861 --> 01:23:43.590
Peter?

01:23:49.769 --> 01:23:51.361
Peter?

01:24:12.992 --> 01:24:15.153
-Hi, Peter.
-Hi, Ms. Lewis.

01:24:15.962 --> 01:24:17.953
What have you boys been up to?

01:24:19.665 --> 01:24:22.463
Well, we just got back from a party.

01:24:22.635 --> 01:24:27.971
Everybody's going off for college,
so it was the last hurrah.
