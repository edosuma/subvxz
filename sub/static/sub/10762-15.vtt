WEBVTT

00:08.742 --> 00:09.743
Ooh, Niles,
sorry I'm late.

00:09.743 --> 00:10.744
Did you sign us up?

00:10.744 --> 00:12.190
Frasier,
I've been thinking.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.414
How many years
have we teamed up
for the squash tournament

00:14.914 --> 00:16.181
only to be eliminated in the second round?

00:16.383 --> 00:17.450
Nine.

00:17.450 --> 00:18.351
Exactly.

00:18.718 --> 00:19.786
Don't you think

00:19.786 --> 00:21.654
it's time we came up
with a new strategy?

00:21.955 --> 00:23.523
Niles, if you're talking
about taking that powder

00:24.024 --> 00:25.025
that's made from
sheep's glands,

00:25.025 --> 00:26.393
the answer is never again.

00:26.726 --> 00:28.795
Well, actually, I was
thinking of something
more fundamental.

00:29.295 --> 00:30.797
It occurs to me that
after nine years...

00:30.797 --> 00:33.133
Shh-shh, Niles,
here comes that two-faced
braggart, Jim Blake.

00:33.466 --> 00:35.535
Jim, looking good.

00:35.535 --> 00:36.436
Thanks, Frasier, thanks.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.338
So, you signed up
for the tournament?

00:38.338 --> 00:39.839
Uh, I don't know.

00:39.839 --> 00:41.841
Have we, partner?

00:44.411 --> 00:45.445
Awesome, awesome.

00:45.879 --> 00:46.446
Let's do it.

00:46.946 --> 00:47.947
I'll see you
on the court, bro.

00:54.954 --> 00:56.456
It's not what
it looks like.

00:56.456 --> 00:57.891
It's exactly
what it looks like.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.826
You've teamed up
with someone younger
and in better shape.

00:59.826 --> 01:00.894
No, Frasier, you know I don't care

01:01.461 --> 01:02.462
about such superficial things

01:02.462 --> 01:03.797
You know, that Jim
is bad news.

01:03.797 --> 01:04.664
He struts around here

01:05.165 --> 01:07.167
in those ridiculous looking
Swedish goggles

01:07.167 --> 01:08.968
that everybody thinks
are so cool.

01:08.968 --> 01:12.305
Jim...

01:12.305 --> 01:14.307
You know, I just wish
you'd told me sooner

01:14.307 --> 01:15.809
instead of waiting
until the last minute.

01:16.309 --> 01:18.178
Does Jim know you're
passive-aggressive?

01:18.178 --> 01:21.581
Believe me, neither Jim nor I expected this to happen.

01:21.581 --> 01:22.582
Our games just meshed.

01:22.582 --> 01:23.583
We would've
teamed up sooner

01:24.084 --> 01:25.085
but the timing
was never right.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.586
Either Jim was with a squash partner

01:27.020 --> 01:27.987
or I was playing with you...

01:27.987 --> 01:30.390
Fine, go, just go, go,
go to your new partner.

01:30.390 --> 01:31.691
I don't care.
Who needs you?

01:34.527 --> 01:35.962
Niles...

01:36.296 --> 01:37.864
Don't forget to wear
your wrist brace.

01:37.864 --> 01:40.633
You know how easily you sprain.

01:46.005 --> 01:48.308
Hi... Frasier.

01:48.541 --> 01:49.576
Chelsea Gray.

01:49.576 --> 01:51.044
We met a few
months ago.
Oh.. yes!

01:51.544 --> 01:53.379
You were kicking
the Gatorade machine.

01:53.680 --> 01:54.214
Of course,
I remember.

01:54.747 --> 01:56.249
I had inserted my dollar bill

01:56.249 --> 01:58.751
with Washington's face up, as per the diagram

01:58.751 --> 02:00.053
and was vended nothing

02:00.320 --> 02:01.387
Did you ever write that letter?

02:01.387 --> 02:02.388
Indeed, I did.

02:02.889 --> 02:03.890
The matter still pends

02:04.390 --> 02:05.391
Ah.

02:05.391 --> 02:06.893
So did you sign up
for the tournament?

02:06.893 --> 02:10.196
Well, I was going to,
but, uh...

02:10.196 --> 02:11.898
I just found out
my customary partner

02:11.898 --> 02:13.733
has made other plans this year.

02:13.733 --> 02:16.870
Well, would you
be interested in playing mixed doubles?

02:16.870 --> 02:18.138
I'm a girls' PE teacher

02:18.138 --> 02:20.540
so it'd be nice to play
with a guy for a change.

02:20.540 --> 02:23.409
Thanks for the offer, but after
what I've just been through,

02:23.409 --> 02:24.911
I'm not sure I'm ready
to partner up again.

02:25.411 --> 02:26.312
That's too bad.

02:26.312 --> 02:27.747
I've seen you play.

02:27.747 --> 02:29.749
We'd make a good team.

02:29.749 --> 02:32.085
You already resorting to playing
with the girls, Frasier?

02:32.085 --> 02:33.920
(chuckles):
No offense, sweetie.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.889
(clicks tongue)

02:35.889 --> 02:38.224
Excuse me.

02:41.094 --> 02:42.428
(screeches):
Ow!

02:44.264 --> 02:45.765
Nice shot, partner.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:55.408 --> 02:56.910
Here we are.

02:56.910 --> 02:57.911
Hello, all.
Hi.

02:58.411 --> 03:01.247
You'll never guess who just won their squash tournament.

03:01.247 --> 03:03.850
If only we had a big, shiny clue.

03:04.050 --> 03:06.386
MARTIN:
Oh, hey, that's great news.

03:06.586 --> 03:08.121
Congratulations.

03:08.121 --> 03:10.356
Well, I owe it all
to my partner.

03:10.356 --> 03:11.624
Oh, thank you, partner

03:11.624 --> 03:13.626
But I think it's really due to our partnership

03:13.626 --> 03:15.028
Aha, well...

03:15.361 --> 03:18.431
now you know what they say,
there's no "I" in "team."

03:18.431 --> 03:21.734
Like there is in "Niles."

03:21.935 --> 03:23.803
FRASIER:
So here, Dad...

03:24.003 --> 03:25.071
check it out.

03:25.071 --> 03:27.073
Wow, would you look at that

03:27.073 --> 03:28.575
I didn't think
 I'd ever see the day

03:28.575 --> 03:30.076
one of my boys
would win a trophy

03:30.076 --> 03:32.512
that didn't have a book on it.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.314
Now all that's left
on my list

03:34.614 --> 03:37.183
is shake hands with Hank Aaron,
kiss Sally Field on the mouth

03:37.183 --> 03:40.053
and then I can go on
and be with your mother.

03:40.386 --> 03:43.456
You know, Jim and I may have
our own trophy soon.

03:43.456 --> 03:45.458
We're still alive in
the men's doubles bracket.

03:45.858 --> 03:46.926
Oh, please, Niles,

03:46.926 --> 03:48.428
your partner couldn't
be carrying you any more

03:48.928 --> 03:49.929
if he put you in a Snugli

03:49.929 --> 03:53.299
and strapped you
to his stomach.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.168
Well, I'm proud of
both of you.

03:55.668 --> 03:57.170
And squash might not be
the toughest of sports

03:57.670 --> 03:58.671
but it's still
technically a sport.

03:59.172 --> 04:00.006
CHELSEA:
What?

04:00.240 --> 04:01.808
Squash can be pretty tough.

04:01.808 --> 04:03.276
Ha.
Oh, no, n-no, no.

04:03.276 --> 04:06.312
I once saw a guy break his leg
in a mid-court collision.

04:06.312 --> 04:08.114
The bone was poking
through his skin

04:08.114 --> 04:10.416
and he still finished the point.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.151
That's the game you guys play?

04:12.151 --> 04:14.988
Hell, yeah.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.422
CHELSEA:
Frasier.

04:16.422 --> 04:18.190
do you mind if I use
your phone?

04:18.190 --> 04:18.992
No, of course not.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.326
Come use the one
in the other room.

04:20.326 --> 04:21.793
That'll give you some privacy.

04:21.793 --> 04:24.297
After you, my lady.

04:24.297 --> 04:28.301
You know, Dad, when Jim and I
win our trophies,

04:28.301 --> 04:30.169
I think I'm going
to give mine to you.

04:30.169 --> 04:31.504
Thank you, son.

04:31.504 --> 04:33.506
But I don't want you
moping around here

04:33.506 --> 04:35.008
if your brother wins one
and you don't.

04:35.508 --> 04:37.510
Oh, please, Dad, I'm a little
 more mature than that.

04:37.510 --> 04:40.780
No, you're not.

04:40.780 --> 04:43.950
It still bugs you that his name
comes first alphabetically.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.785
Well, that was your fault.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.189
Your girlfriend seems nice.

04:50.690 --> 04:54.193
She is nice,
but she's certainly
not my girlfriend.

04:54.193 --> 04:56.195
I do find her attractive, but...

04:56.195 --> 04:59.966
I'm not sure I'm anything
more than a teammate to her.

05:00.199 --> 05:03.269
Well, from what I've seen, I'd say she likes you a lot.

05:03.269 --> 05:04.570
Really?

05:04.570 --> 05:05.838
She did kiss me once.

05:05.838 --> 05:08.341
But I think that was just
in an overflow of emotion

05:08.341 --> 05:09.842
after one of our victories.

05:09.842 --> 05:12.278
You know, I suppose that happens
all the time on sports teams.

05:12.278 --> 05:14.714
It doesn't.

05:14.714 --> 05:19.018
Of course, I can't speak
for the Canadian leagues.

05:19.018 --> 05:20.853
Well, truth be told,
now that there's not

05:20.853 --> 05:24.724
the excitement of the tournament
to fuel the fires...

05:24.724 --> 05:26.559
I don't think we really
have much in common

05:26.559 --> 05:27.827
in the real world.

05:27.827 --> 05:32.031
You have your
ostentatious trophies.

05:32.031 --> 05:34.467
Well, it was good seeing you
all, but I have to get going.

05:34.467 --> 05:36.469
Oh, so soon?
You just got here.

05:36.469 --> 05:37.937
I have an early faculty meeting.

05:38.404 --> 05:39.472
FRASIER:
I'll walk you out.

05:41.674 --> 05:42.241
MARTIN: Come back!

05:42.742 --> 05:43.242
DAPHNE:
Bye-bye.

05:43.743 --> 05:45.078
Bye.
Bye.
Congratulations.

05:48.981 --> 05:50.416
Well, I, uh.

05:50.416 --> 05:52.485
I certainly had a great
time the last few weeks.

05:52.485 --> 05:54.487
Yeah, me, too.

05:54.487 --> 05:57.490
Call me again, if you
want to play sometime.

06:01.761 --> 06:05.064
I don't suppose you'd
to take this to the next level?

06:05.064 --> 06:09.302
Oh, I gave up my
dream of professional squash years ago.

06:11.771 --> 06:13.773
That's not what I meant.

06:13.773 --> 06:17.777
Um... maybe I could think of
another way to put it.

06:34.627 --> 06:35.628
Oh, hi, Daph.

06:35.628 --> 06:37.130
Hey, I didn't expect
to see you here.

06:37.630 --> 06:39.432
Niles said you were
going out with Chelsea.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.234
Oh, yes, yes-- I just thought I'd stopby

06:41.234 --> 06:43.536
for a quick pick-me-
up before I pick her up

06:43.736 --> 06:45.238
Does she laugh
at that kind of stuff?

06:45.605 --> 06:46.172
You know, she does

06:46.672 --> 06:48.141
Hold on to this one.
I intend to.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.977
Uh, espresso, please.

06:51.277 --> 06:55.348
You know, every day I learn something new about her.

06:55.348 --> 06:58.651
She enjoys reading
poetry in the bath

06:58.918 --> 07:01.320
She's an excellent cook.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.656
It's like she's
the perfect girl for me.

07:03.656 --> 07:05.925
Well, I think you make
a lovely couple.

07:05.925 --> 07:08.661
Even though Niles can't believe you're dating a gym teacher.

07:08.661 --> 07:10.630
He says it's a betrayal
of your younger selves.

07:10.630 --> 07:12.565
It's perfectly understandable

07:12.565 --> 07:15.568
We didn't have much luck with gym
teachers when we were kids.

07:15.568 --> 07:18.070
They were always
so derisive and
ego-crippling.

07:18.070 --> 07:21.574
There was this one
 in particular, Coach Fuller..

07:21.574 --> 07:23.576
he was the worst.

07:23.576 --> 07:26.078
The kind of man that would make the whole class wait

07:26.078 --> 07:27.947
while you did your push-up

07:27.947 --> 07:29.849
It was just so traumatizing,

07:30.349 --> 07:33.219
I would actually lose my
lunch before gym period.

07:33.219 --> 07:35.588
Except on those days when my lunch money was stolen.

07:35.588 --> 07:37.356
Then I'd just dry heave.

07:37.356 --> 07:40.693
Niles has tons
of stories like that.

07:40.693 --> 07:42.028
You know...

07:42.028 --> 07:43.396
perhaps getting to know Chelsea

07:43.896 --> 07:46.866
will help Niles to exorcise his
demons and put them behind him.

07:46.866 --> 07:49.836
He's running out of room
back there.

07:49.836 --> 07:50.837
Hey, Roz.
Hey, Daphne.

07:51.337 --> 07:52.205
Hey, Frasier.
Hi, Roz.

07:52.205 --> 07:53.706
You all right?

07:53.706 --> 07:56.209
I was fine until I saw
Julia in the parking lot.

07:56.209 --> 07:57.710
Why does she have to come here?

07:57.710 --> 07:59.212
For God's sakes, Roz.

07:59.212 --> 08:02.215
I'm a little tired
of hearing you complain
about Julia all the time.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.217
Why don't you just
give her a chance?

08:04.217 --> 08:05.182
How about her?

08:07.887 --> 08:09.388
and she shows me no respect.

08:09.889 --> 08:12.391
She's mean and arrogant, but not in a funny way, like you.

08:12.391 --> 08:14.861
Could I have
a latte, please?

08:14.861 --> 08:16.362
The woman took
a portion of my show

08:16.362 --> 08:17.363
to do her financial drivel.

08:17.363 --> 08:19.632
You don't hear me complaining
about it all the time.

08:19.632 --> 08:20.399
Now enough is enough.

08:20.399 --> 08:21.901
Julia...

08:21.901 --> 08:23.903
why don't you
come and join us?

08:23.903 --> 08:25.905
Oh, all right.

08:25.905 --> 08:28.908
Thank you.

08:29.408 --> 08:31.911
Hello, Frasier.

08:31.911 --> 08:36.849
Well, isn't this nice?

08:36.849 --> 08:38.251
All right,
it's come to my attention

08:38.818 --> 08:41.120
that there is some tension
between the two of you.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.421
Now, as it is
entirely possible

08:42.421 --> 08:43.356
that we will be spending

08:43.356 --> 08:44.824
a great deal of time together,

08:44.824 --> 08:46.325
I think it's important
that we establish

08:46.325 --> 08:48.628
an environment
of mutual respect.

08:48.628 --> 08:49.428
To that end,

08:49.929 --> 08:51.430
as it is impossible
for the two of you

08:51.430 --> 08:52.932
to communicate at all,

08:52.932 --> 08:57.770
it's time for me to roll up
my sleeves and facilitate.

08:57.770 --> 09:00.773
Finding some common ground
would be the first step.

09:00.773 --> 09:04.210
Perhaps a love of plants,
the seed...

09:04.210 --> 09:06.112
You sure love to hear
yourself talk.

09:06.112 --> 09:08.047
And it's impossible to tune him out.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.282
How can you stand it?

09:09.515 --> 09:11.584
The key is to know
when to say "uh-huh."

09:11.584 --> 09:12.952
FRASIER:
Fine, fine,
all right.

09:13.219 --> 09:16.289
If I am your common ground,
so be it.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.723
Please feel free
to tread upon me.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.125
Uh-huh.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.626
The important thing is
that you're talking.

09:21.127 --> 09:21.961
Communication...

09:22.228 --> 09:23.296
Just go.

09:29.368 --> 09:30.803
Okay, he's gone.

09:44.817 --> 09:47.753
CHELSEA:
Slowly.

09:47.753 --> 09:49.155
Oh.

09:49.155 --> 09:50.489
Be with you
in a minute.

09:50.489 --> 09:52.258
You can wait in my office.

09:57.263 --> 10:00.333
(claps):
Very nice. Nice.

10:00.833 --> 10:02.702
All right,
concentrate.

10:04.036 --> 10:07.707
There we go!
Good!

10:08.074 --> 10:10.643
"Please excuse my daughter Ruby
from PE."

10:10.643 --> 10:11.644
CHELSEA:
Concentrate!

10:12.144 --> 10:16.148
"She has a 'delibitating' disease."

10:16.148 --> 10:17.416
Nice try, Ruby.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.184
(whistle blows)

10:18.684 --> 10:21.187
Okay, who didn't climb rope yet?

10:21.187 --> 10:23.189
Campbell, you're up.

10:34.033 --> 10:35.534
Oh, I'd forgotten how it felt

10:35.534 --> 10:36.902
to sneak a kiss in school.

10:37.203 --> 10:38.671
It always
looked like fun.

10:38.971 --> 10:40.539
So I'll be finished here in a second

10:41.040 --> 10:42.475
and then we can go.
Great, great.

10:42.808 --> 10:43.876
I thought we'd try
this new place I just...

10:43.876 --> 10:44.877
(blows)

10:44.877 --> 10:46.812
Campbell, you're not even trying.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.214
(sighs)

10:48.214 --> 10:49.548
Sorry. You were saying?

10:49.982 --> 10:51.550
Yeah, I read a great review
of this new restaurant.

10:51.550 --> 10:53.052
Apparently
the chef is from...

10:53.052 --> 10:55.054
(bell rings, whistle blows)

10:55.054 --> 10:58.491
No one is leaving
until Campbell climbs the rope!

11:00.993 --> 11:02.061
(

11:02.561 --> 11:03.562
Come on!

11:03.562 --> 11:05.364
You can sleep
through English.

11:05.364 --> 11:07.700
Toughen up,
you can do it.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.602
Let's go, Campbell!

11:09.602 --> 11:11.537
Everybody's waiting.

11:11.537 --> 11:13.873
COACH FULLER:
Come on, Crane!

11:13.873 --> 11:16.075
Nobody is going home

11:16.075 --> 11:18.911
until you haul that fat bucket of lard
to the top.

11:18.911 --> 11:20.379
(cries):
I can't.

11:20.379 --> 11:22.882
I can't.

11:26.719 --> 11:30.189
Just give me a few minutes
and I'll be ready to go.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.091
Oh, I just need you to do one thing.

11:32.091 --> 11:34.460
Drop and give me 20, Crane.

11:34.460 --> 11:38.364
I beg your pardon?

11:38.364 --> 11:39.765
Could you just round up
the basketballs

11:40.266 --> 11:41.600
and put them in the rack
over there?

11:41.600 --> 11:43.869
Thanks

11:43.869 --> 11:46.172
(whistle blows)

12:01.520 --> 12:04.523
Frasier, Niles has
something

12:04.523 --> 12:06.525
he needs to tell you.

12:09.528 --> 12:10.529
Go on, tell him.

12:10.529 --> 12:12.031
I'm sick of hearing
you complain.

12:14.300 --> 12:17.369
I made a mistake
partnering with Jim.

12:17.369 --> 12:20.372
Our styles never really meshed,
which wasn't my fault,

12:20.372 --> 12:22.374
but that didn't stop him

12:22.374 --> 12:24.376
from losing his temper
during a match,

12:24.376 --> 12:25.745
and he yelled at me.

12:26.045 --> 12:28.481
With you,
it was different.

12:28.814 --> 12:30.382
You brought honor to the game.

12:30.883 --> 12:31.884
Rejoin me, Frasier,

12:31.884 --> 12:34.653
and together we can rekindle
the magic.

12:36.956 --> 12:38.023
Please take him back.

12:38.023 --> 12:40.493
I cannot listen to another draft
of this speech.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.428
I'll see you
at home, sweetie.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.429
Thanks, hon.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.433
Niles, I'll gladly re-team with you

12:47.933 --> 12:49.068
Just like that?

12:49.068 --> 12:53.639
I expected you to gloat
and rub it in, make me suffer.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.107
Don't you care?

12:55.541 --> 12:56.575
Oh, my apologies, Niles.

12:57.076 --> 12:59.578
It's just that I'm a little distracted about something

12:59.578 --> 13:01.413
that happened yesterday
at Chelsea's school.

13:01.413 --> 13:02.782
I'm sorry,
but that reminds me--

13:02.782 --> 13:03.783
Chelsea sent me
the sweetest gift

13:03.783 --> 13:05.751
after Jim and I were
eliminated from
the tournament.

13:05.751 --> 13:08.754
It's an actual squash
with a smiley face drawn on it.

13:08.754 --> 13:10.256
That's cute.

13:10.256 --> 13:11.757
You know, when you
first started dating her,

13:11.757 --> 13:14.260
I couldn't get past the fact that she was a gym teacher.

13:14.260 --> 13:16.262
But she's proven to be
nothing like I expected.

13:16.262 --> 13:17.229
Kudos to you.

13:17.229 --> 13:19.532
Well, not sure I deserve
such praise.

13:19.532 --> 13:20.933
No, no, don't be so modest, Frasier.

13:21.433 --> 13:22.434
You truly have a gift

13:22.434 --> 13:24.236
for seeing the inner beauty
in a person.

13:24.236 --> 13:25.437
I do try.

13:25.437 --> 13:26.772
Speak of the devil.

13:26.772 --> 13:28.174
Here's Dad
and Chelsea now.

13:28.541 --> 13:29.608
MARTIN:
Hey, guys.

13:29.608 --> 13:30.976
Look who I ran into.

13:31.277 --> 13:32.812
NILES:
Hello, Dad.

13:32.812 --> 13:33.846
Hi, Chelsea.

13:33.846 --> 13:35.848
Niles.

13:35.848 --> 13:37.783
Hello, sweetie.

13:37.783 --> 13:40.853
NILES:
That's a lovely
outfit.

13:41.353 --> 13:42.254
Really?

13:42.588 --> 13:45.558
You think so, huh?

13:45.891 --> 13:47.459
I thought it might be
a little racy,

13:47.960 --> 13:49.461
but then I thought,
what the hell.

13:49.461 --> 13:51.964
What do you think, Frasier?

13:51.964 --> 13:53.966
Oh, it's very.
.. very becoming.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.367
CHELSEA:
Thank you.

13:55.734 --> 13:58.804
Just let me grab a drink
and we'll be ready to go.

13:59.305 --> 14:01.307
I usually stay out
of your love affairs, son,

14:01.307 --> 14:02.808
but you've got
a good one here.

14:02.808 --> 14:03.742
Definitely a keeper.

14:03.742 --> 14:05.144
Yes, and might I add--

14:05.144 --> 14:06.979
and excuse my gutter speak--
hubba, hubba.

14:08.180 --> 14:09.481
Back to our best behavior.

14:09.481 --> 14:10.983
There's a lady present.

14:10.983 --> 14:12.952
ie.
I'm ready, sweet

14:26.999 --> 14:32.037
"Love is a smoke raised
from the fume of sighs,

14:32.037 --> 14:37.543
being purged, a fire
sparkling in lovers' eyes..."

14:37.543 --> 14:39.011
You all right?

14:39.011 --> 14:40.546
What?

14:40.546 --> 14:42.047
I'm fine.

14:42.047 --> 14:43.515
CHELSEA:
All right, good.

14:43.515 --> 14:45.451
"I am a vessel,

14:45.451 --> 14:48.420
"come tenderly
and fill me

14:48.888 --> 14:52.424
with the nectar
of your love."

14:53.425 --> 14:55.427
So I figure since
you're the financial guru,

14:55.928 --> 14:56.896
you could help me out.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.365
Now obviously, I don't want to get involved in

14:59.365 --> 15:00.866
some get-rich-quick scheme,

15:00.866 --> 15:03.869
but I do need to make
a lot of money really fast.

15:03.869 --> 15:04.837
So what do you got?

15:04.837 --> 15:06.705
I don't like to talk about work

15:06.705 --> 15:08.207
when I'm outside the office.

15:08.207 --> 15:09.742
Oh.

15:09.742 --> 15:10.743
Thank you.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.145
Right.
Me neither

15:14.546 --> 15:17.383
Hey, there's Roz.

15:17.783 --> 15:18.350
Hey, Roz, come join us.

15:18.851 --> 15:19.852
I don't think so.

15:19.852 --> 15:21.353
No, no, no, I won't take no for an answer.

15:21.854 --> 15:24.356
Now you sit down.

15:24.356 --> 15:25.858
Hi, Julia.

15:25.858 --> 15:27.359
Roz.

15:27.359 --> 15:29.862
Well, I know girl talk
when I hear it. Bye.

15:32.865 --> 15:34.867
I'll go this time.

15:34.867 --> 15:36.368
Thanks.

15:38.837 --> 15:40.906
You know, maybe Frasier
was right.

15:40.906 --> 15:43.842
Would it kill us
to make some effort to be civil?

15:44.176 --> 15:46.078
I guess not.

15:48.914 --> 15:50.416
Thanks

15:50.416 --> 15:52.184
So

15:52.384 --> 15:54.853
Your show was good today.

15:55.187 --> 15:57.589
Yes, it was.

15:57.856 --> 15:59.291
And...

15:59.591 --> 16:03.429
and your producing
was top-notch.

16:03.429 --> 16:05.331
Thanks

16:05.831 --> 16:06.832
Sugar?

16:06.832 --> 16:10.169
Please.

16:10.169 --> 16:11.503
Well, this isn't so bad.

16:11.503 --> 16:12.404
No, it's not.

16:12.404 --> 16:15.207
Maybe we just got off
on the wrong foot.

16:15.207 --> 16:16.575
Well, when you first started,

16:16.575 --> 16:18.577
I just thought you were
kind of a bitch

16:18.577 --> 16:19.979
for ordering everyone around.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.414
That's totally my fault.

16:22.414 --> 16:26.185
I have a tendency
to be patronizing

16:26.185 --> 16:29.788
to entry-level
employees.

16:29.788 --> 16:32.124
Well, you know, I was going to say something earlier,

16:32.124 --> 16:34.560
but when I heard
your first show,

16:34.560 --> 16:37.930
I figured you wouldn't
be here long.

16:37.930 --> 16:41.300
Well, you certainly made
an impression on me.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.801
I remember, I kept thinking,

16:42.801 --> 16:45.304
"Who did she sleep with
to get this job?"

16:45.304 --> 16:46.305
And then I found out.

16:46.805 --> 16:48.307
Everybody.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.543
That's a good one.

16:51.543 --> 16:53.345
(chuckling)

16:53.345 --> 16:55.180
You know, there's
a plunger in the bathroom.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.182
What do you say we go look
for your career?

16:58.584 --> 16:59.985
Great.

16:59.985 --> 17:02.388
While we're in there,
I can get your phone number.

17:04.356 --> 17:05.824
Don't bother.

17:05.824 --> 17:08.260
It's 1-800-BITE ME.

17:08.260 --> 17:10.429
Bite me?
That's the best that you've got?

17:10.429 --> 17:12.196
Oh, I could spend half an hour
on your hair.

17:12.196 --> 17:14.665
Well, you should have spent
a half an hour on your hair.

17:14.665 --> 17:16.167
Oh, really?

17:16.167 --> 17:17.669
It's closing time,
ladies.

17:17.669 --> 17:19.171
I'm afraid
you'll have to leave.

17:19.171 --> 17:21.173
But we're
just warming up.

17:21.673 --> 17:23.675
You know, there's
a place down the street

17:23.675 --> 17:24.675
that is open all night.

17:24.675 --> 17:26.678
Just like your mouth?

17:26.678 --> 17:29.181
Just like your legs.

17:29.181 --> 17:32.184
Hey, wait up.

17:40.692 --> 17:44.696
So, we're just going to go to sleep, huh?

17:49.701 --> 17:52.204
I'm really tired.

17:52.704 --> 17:54.206
You sure you don't want to watch TV

17:54.706 --> 17:55.707
or get something to eat?

17:56.208 --> 17:57.142
No.

17:57.142 --> 18:00.112
I know someone
who's ticklish.

18:00.112 --> 18:03.115
No, stop, stop, stop!

18:06.218 --> 18:11.123
Okay, Frasier, you've been acting weird all day.

18:11.123 --> 18:13.058
What's going on?

18:13.559 --> 18:16.061
Well, it's a little
complicated.

18:16.061 --> 18:17.062
What is?

18:17.062 --> 18:19.565
Is there a problem?

18:25.237 --> 18:28.173
Yes, Chelsea, there is.

18:28.574 --> 18:29.641
It disturbed me yesterday

18:29.641 --> 18:33.145
when I saw you yelling at
that little girl on the rope.

18:33.579 --> 18:35.647
I couldn't believe
how harsh you were.

18:35.647 --> 18:38.150
And you may not realize it,

18:38.150 --> 18:40.119
but that can have
a crippling effect on a child.

18:40.486 --> 18:43.055
What?!

18:43.055 --> 18:46.058
I didn't think I was being excessively harsh.

18:46.058 --> 18:48.927
I was just trying
to motivate her.

18:49.228 --> 18:51.296
Yes, well, the way
you were shouting,

18:51.296 --> 18:52.297
it was hard to tell.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.800
And when you're a child,
all you know is

18:54.800 --> 18:56.268
you're being singled out

18:58.170 --> 19:01.740
I have no right to tell you
how to do your job.

19:01.740 --> 19:04.576
It's, uh... it's my problem, not yours.

19:04.576 --> 19:06.411
No, no.

19:06.411 --> 19:08.714
You may have a point.

19:10.349 --> 19:14.686
Maybe... I do push too hard.

19:15.187 --> 19:17.689
Sometimes I forget

19:17.689 --> 19:21.627
just how fragile kids can be.

19:21.627 --> 19:23.095
Really?

19:23.095 --> 19:24.897
You agree with me?

19:24.897 --> 19:26.665
Yes, I do.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.634
Thank you, Frasier

19:37.075 --> 19:40.479
It's sweet of you to care so much.

19:40.479 --> 19:43.849
Well, you're worth
caring about.

19:46.218 --> 19:47.719
Now, come on.

19:48.153 --> 19:52.191
Let's go have a nice,
romantic dinner.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.159
Okay, all right.

19:54.159 --> 19:56.161
Let me just
go get ready.

19:56.662 --> 19:57.663
You know,
when I heard you shouting

19:58.163 --> 19:59.164
at that little girl today,

19:59.164 --> 20:01.166
I swear, it just brought back
a flood of memories

20:01.667 --> 20:02.501
from my own childhood.

20:02.501 --> 20:03.802
Really?
Oh, yeah.

20:04.303 --> 20:05.237
You know,
my gym teacher

20:05.237 --> 20:07.172
was constantly yelling at me

20:07.172 --> 20:09.174
because I couldn't do
a single pull-up

20:09.174 --> 20:10.442
or a lap

20:10.442 --> 20:12.711
around the track.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.713
Not even one?

20:14.713 --> 20:16.982
Oh, please.

20:16.982 --> 20:18.750
I was a
very late bloomer.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.686
I could barely do
a jumping jack

20:20.686 --> 20:22.254
without getting
a nosebleed.

20:22.254 --> 20:24.756
And let's not begin
to talk about

20:25.257 --> 20:26.258
the climbing rope.

20:26.758 --> 20:28.694
There we go,
all done.

20:33.599 --> 20:34.600
Well...

20:37.970 --> 20:41.873
What do you say I get us
a table at Petite Auberge?

20:41.873 --> 20:44.743
They do an excellent veal chop.

20:45.110 --> 20:47.012
Okay.

20:47.012 --> 20:48.847
