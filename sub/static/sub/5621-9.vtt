<i>You're watching</i> The Grinder.

00:18.552 --> 00:19.952
Objection, Your Honor...
I think it's time

00:19.954 --> 00:21.520
we remind Counselor Grinder
what state he's in.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.522
Mr. Grinder, are you aware

00:23.524 --> 00:25.624
that we're in the great state
of Louisiana?

00:27.061 --> 00:29.061
I am now.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.898
But I was in a completely
different state last night.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.333
I can tell you that.

00:34.335 --> 00:35.701
(laughter)

00:35.703 --> 00:38.570
Objection overruled.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.406
Guilty on all charges.

00:40.408 --> 00:41.573
Son, welcome to the South.

00:41.575 --> 00:44.476
(gavel bangs, applause)

00:44.478 --> 00:48.380
WOMAN:
Well, that was impressive.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.349
Especially considering
that was our first case

00:50.351 --> 00:52.918
since you took over
your brother's firm

00:52.920 --> 00:55.387
and relocated it here
to New Orleans.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.322
Your Honor?

00:57.324 --> 01:01.193
If it pleases the court,
may we have the room?

01:01.195 --> 01:02.961
Clear the courtroom.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.433
I want to hear you say it.

01:07.435 --> 01:09.268
The way your brother
never could.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.103
RAKE:
You sure you can handle it?

01:11.105 --> 01:13.005
Say it.

01:13.007 --> 01:16.108
Grinder... rests.

01:16.110 --> 01:17.242
Oh, yes!

01:20.614 --> 01:22.081
(moans)

01:27.455 --> 01:29.521
(theme song playing)

01:32.026 --> 01:34.126
Well, that was...

01:34.128 --> 01:36.061
not good.
Right?

01:36.063 --> 01:37.529
Guy was shirtless
through the whole episode.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.198
I mean, that offended me.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.566
I hate to think this
is where TV is headed.

01:40.568 --> 01:43.202
What didn't you like
about it, Stew?

01:43.204 --> 01:45.237
Uh, well, I didn't like

01:45.239 --> 01:48.607
the, uh, it didn't
have the same, um,

01:48.609 --> 01:50.476
the same, the same quality,

01:50.478 --> 01:51.610
you know, as the, uh,

01:51.612 --> 01:53.145
as the original<i> Grinder.</i>

01:53.147 --> 01:55.247
And-and what about this
did you think was much worse?

01:55.249 --> 01:56.882
Uh, I, uh...

01:56.884 --> 01:57.916
(whispers):
Timothy Olyphant.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.785
Timothy Olyphant.
Huh.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.420
He was disappointing.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.422
I saw his face was handsome,
you know,

02:03.424 --> 02:05.457
it was a handsome face.
Give me a break.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.792
But pretty-boy handsome.
He's really pretty.

02:06.794 --> 02:09.228
Yeah, not your kind
of handsome.
Mm-mm.

02:09.230 --> 02:10.729
And now we're supposed to care
about The Grinder's brother?

02:10.731 --> 02:12.297
Who wants to watch
a show about his

02:12.299 --> 02:14.233
less cool,
less handsome brother?

02:14.235 --> 02:15.235
Not me.
No one.

02:15.236 --> 02:16.602
Literally no one.
Not even a show.

02:16.604 --> 02:17.736
I think there could be

02:17.738 --> 02:18.871
an audience for-for that.

02:23.410 --> 02:25.244
DEAN:
"The Grinder: New Orleans...

02:25.246 --> 02:27.346
"a fresh reimagining

02:27.348 --> 02:29.348
of what it truly means
to grind."

02:29.350 --> 02:31.116
Were they watching
the same show we were?

02:31.118 --> 02:32.417
I wouldn't get hung up on that.

02:32.419 --> 02:34.419
They don't know
what the hell's going on.

02:34.421 --> 02:35.988
You're right.
It's in the past.

02:35.990 --> 02:38.257
I've moved on.
Wish him all the best.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.691
Not me.
I hope it tanks.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.326
It doesn't matter, does it?

02:41.328 --> 02:43.028
'Cause what really matters
is this... family.

02:43.030 --> 02:44.429
So, let's do that.

02:44.431 --> 02:45.264
Lizzie, what you got?

02:45.266 --> 02:46.798
Oh.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.667
I'm having trouble in math.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.036
Fantastic, there's my girl.
Anybody else?

02:51.038 --> 02:52.871
Well, I got to go
get my car washed.

02:52.873 --> 02:54.973
It's got this smell in it.
I love it.

02:54.975 --> 02:56.308
What about you, Stew?
What? What are we doing?

02:56.310 --> 02:57.509
We're talking about
our lives, Stew.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.810
ETHAN:
I've got one.

02:58.812 --> 02:59.978
Brie doesn't like me anymore.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.480
I heard she likes Liam now.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.282
Oh, sweetie, that sucks.
Buddy, are you okay?

03:03.284 --> 03:05.317
I want to get her back,
but I don't know how.

03:05.319 --> 03:06.818
Well, have you tried
telling her how you feel?

03:06.820 --> 03:08.887
You can't go wrong
with honest conversation.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.523
Or you find a slightly
hotter girl than Brie,

03:11.525 --> 03:13.125
you start hanging out with her,

03:13.127 --> 03:14.960
she starts to feel jealous,
it messes with her self-esteem,

03:14.962 --> 03:16.528
and she comes
crawling back to you.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.796
I don't think
we're trying to promote...

03:17.798 --> 03:20.299
That could be cool!
Okay.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.201
No, that's not cool.
I think the honest conversation

03:22.203 --> 03:23.969
thing is the way to go.
You can try it.

03:23.971 --> 03:25.337
But the hotter girl thing
will be a lot more effective.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.139
Yeah, I want to do that.

03:27.141 --> 03:28.640
It feels like,
even if stuff goes wrong,

03:28.642 --> 03:29.875
I could do okay.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.837
Yeah, that move
feels right for you.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.646
TODD:
<i>I thought it was atrocious.</i>

03:34.648 --> 03:37.015
I thought that man... I don't
even want to say his name...

03:37.017 --> 03:38.650
Did a disservice to you,

03:38.652 --> 03:41.486
the character, not to mention
the entire franchise.

03:41.488 --> 03:42.988
Thank you, Todd.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.590
Claire, what were
your issues with it?

03:44.592 --> 03:46.358
Oh, I didn't have any.
I thought it kind of worked.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.060
Oh, here we go.
What did you just say?

03:48.062 --> 03:49.061
I'm sorry, Dean,
you shouldn't have to...

03:49.063 --> 03:50.162
No, no, no, no, it's fine.

03:50.164 --> 03:53.065
I'd like to hear
what she has to say.

03:53.067 --> 03:54.533
Well, it knows what it is.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.168
I mean, it's a cheesy soap
where the hot guy

03:56.170 --> 03:57.369
takes his shirt off
all the time, you know?

03:57.371 --> 03:58.570
It's not trying
to be all important.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.172
So you're saying

04:00.174 --> 04:03.342
that you found him... hot?

04:03.344 --> 04:05.043
Yeah.
Huh.

04:05.045 --> 04:07.012
Yeah, I'm not sure we're gonna
solve this today, but I do know

04:07.014 --> 04:09.581
we have a lot of work to do,
so it be great if we could...

04:09.583 --> 04:10.649
Move on?

04:12.019 --> 04:14.453
That's what we're all
looking to do, isn't it?

04:14.455 --> 04:16.455
Cliff.
Hello, Dean.

04:16.457 --> 04:18.790
(whispers): Cliff Bemis,
the creator of<i> The Grinder.</i>

04:18.792 --> 04:19.725
Thank you, son.

04:19.727 --> 04:21.593
What are you doing here?

04:21.595 --> 04:22.461
Did you see the show?

04:22.463 --> 04:23.595
I did.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.464
And I thought it was genius.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.232
It's your best work.
You should be very proud.

04:27.234 --> 04:29.201
Now if you'll excuse us,
we have work to do.

04:29.203 --> 04:31.036
I don't know if you've
read the news, but, uh,

04:31.038 --> 04:32.771
I'm working on real cases now.
Um...

04:32.773 --> 04:33.972
You must be the brother.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.207
Heard a lot about you.

04:35.209 --> 04:37.075
Uh, yes, likewise.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.044
It's, uh, a pleasure
to meet you.

04:39.046 --> 04:43.282
Didn't you get a protected left
put in somewhere?

04:43.284 --> 04:45.317
Or am I thinking
of someone else?

04:45.319 --> 04:46.985
No, that was me. I did that!

04:46.987 --> 04:48.120
14th and Cedar.

04:48.122 --> 04:51.056
That's impressive.

04:51.058 --> 04:54.393
Helping real people
with real problems.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.328
It's what you always
wanted to do.

04:56.330 --> 04:57.663
Now, you are.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.064
What do you want?

04:59.066 --> 05:00.799
Need a small favor.

05:02.336 --> 05:04.269
Yes, the show's a hit.

05:04.271 --> 05:05.937
Yes, the critics love it.

05:05.939 --> 05:08.940
Yes, Olyphant has been
embraced by the nation.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.909
You didn't come all the way here
to tell me that.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.444
Nope.

05:12.446 --> 05:15.580
I came here to tell you
that none of that matters.

05:15.582 --> 05:16.915
What matters...

05:16.917 --> 05:19.184
is what the fans
are saying on Twitter

05:19.186 --> 05:21.153
and other
social media platforms.

05:21.155 --> 05:22.988
The true barometer of success.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.957
And the people are asking...

05:25.959 --> 05:28.160
where is Mitch?

05:31.031 --> 05:33.432
So you want me
to pass the torch.

05:33.434 --> 05:36.368
One scene, Dean.
We come to you. We make it easy.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.036
Can he see us?

05:38.038 --> 05:39.604
Why would he not be
able to see us, Todd?

05:39.606 --> 05:41.540
Paint it for me.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.709
Christmas Day. Church.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.711
Avery's there with her family.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.646
Choir's singing.

05:47.648 --> 05:49.348
Children laughing.

05:49.350 --> 05:52.351
But everything
is<i> not</i> as it seems.

05:52.353 --> 05:55.954
Priest has a bomb
under his robe.
Ah.

05:55.956 --> 05:59.324
Luckily, Mitch Grinder

05:59.326 --> 06:01.460
is vacationing in New Orleans,

06:01.462 --> 06:03.462
and is there
to diffuse the bomb.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.130
And I save everyone.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.398
(chuckles):
Oh, yeah.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.133
Then the bomb goes off, you die.

06:08.135 --> 06:10.202
And then Olyphant comes in,
rips off his shirt

06:10.204 --> 06:11.570
and takes over the firm.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.338
You're gonna kill him?

06:13.340 --> 06:15.874
You're gonna kill Mitch Grinder?

06:15.876 --> 06:18.143
And I'm supposed
to help you with that?

06:18.145 --> 06:21.012
Think of it as giving Mitch
the send-off he deserves.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.981
And what if I say no?

06:22.983 --> 06:24.850
He dies either way.

06:24.852 --> 06:27.052
Now, it can be a hero's death

06:27.054 --> 06:30.889
on-screen... or...

06:30.891 --> 06:34.626
a coward's death... off.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.496
Take some time.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.398
Think about it.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.273
You know, I don't think
he can see us.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.035
See? I told you.
Yeah.

06:54.948 --> 06:59.050
It's weird because if he dies,
then a part of me dies.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.787
Yeah, that is...
very weird.

07:01.789 --> 07:04.623
I'm so sorry for your loss.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.391
I lost myself in that part.

07:06.393 --> 07:09.127
And I never broke, never!

07:09.129 --> 07:11.630
When I was Mitch, I<i> was</i> Mitch.

07:11.632 --> 07:12.864
And where was Dean?

07:12.866 --> 07:14.399
I honestly have no idea.

07:14.401 --> 07:17.803
Dean didn't tell Mitch
what he was up to.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.905
They don't know
each other, Stew.

07:19.907 --> 07:22.874
Right, I didn't...
I thought... Yeah.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.444
And you never wanted
to introduce them?

07:25.446 --> 07:26.878
One time, my girlfriend
came to set.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.413
And I wanted to talk to her

07:28.415 --> 07:30.882
as Dean so badly,

07:30.884 --> 07:32.918
'cause she was clearly
going through some stuff.

07:32.920 --> 07:33.819
Couldn't do it.

07:33.821 --> 07:35.787
I never was able to tell

07:35.789 --> 07:38.557
Daryl Hannah why I was leaving
her for that younger actress.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.425
Not even at the end of the day?

07:40.427 --> 07:43.428
Like... when you were done
pretending to be this guy?

07:43.430 --> 07:45.964
I was never done.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.232
I was never pretending.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.167
Well, maybe this is
for the best.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.135
You wanted to move on, right?

07:50.137 --> 07:51.603
What if I'm too scared?

07:51.605 --> 07:55.240
Too scared to...
kill a fictional character

07:55.242 --> 07:57.008
because a part of you
will also die?

07:57.010 --> 07:59.277
I guess I just always
took comfort in thinking

07:59.279 --> 08:01.279
that somehow
he was still out there.

08:01.281 --> 08:03.348
Fighting.

08:03.350 --> 08:04.416
Grinding.

08:04.418 --> 08:06.084
Without you?

08:06.086 --> 08:07.586
And that I could call him up,

08:07.588 --> 08:09.287
get him on the phone and...

08:09.289 --> 08:12.958
talk to him, if...
things here didn't work out.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.459
Wait.

08:14.461 --> 08:17.996
So, like, as a...
as a backup plan to this.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.531
You-you could always
go back there.

08:19.533 --> 08:22.000
Hey, Uncle Dean,
your advice totally worked.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.436
I hung out with this hot girl,
Zoe, in front of Brie.

08:24.438 --> 08:27.506
Wait, what?
She's done with Liam.
She likes me again.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.441
So you didn't try the honest
conversation thing at all?

08:29.443 --> 08:30.675
Didn't need to.

08:30.677 --> 08:33.311
Uncle Dean's advice crushed.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.046
Well, it's nice to know
I can still help people,

08:35.048 --> 08:36.048
even though I'm hurting.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.315
STEWART:
Uh...

08:37.317 --> 08:38.550
could you go back to the thing

08:38.552 --> 08:39.551
about the, uh, the backup plan?

08:39.553 --> 08:41.152
(sighs)

08:41.154 --> 08:43.989
I just always thought that Mitch
would go on without me.

08:43.991 --> 08:45.390
You know?

08:45.392 --> 08:47.025
Maybe down
in the Florida Keys...

08:47.027 --> 08:49.494
becomes a judge.

08:49.496 --> 08:51.863
Maybe he runs a Cuban nightclub
on the weekend...

08:51.865 --> 08:53.565
lives with his black girlfriend.

08:53.567 --> 08:57.135
I could totally picture that.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.236
DEAN:
It would do so much

08:58.238 --> 08:59.638
for race relations, you know?

08:59.640 --> 09:01.039
Help us heal.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.141
Dean, if that's where you see
Mitch winding up,

09:03.143 --> 09:04.709
then that's where
Mitch has to wind up.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.478
And it shouldn't be up to Bemis,

09:06.480 --> 09:07.979
because you<i> are</i> Mitch.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.681
That's right.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.182
Mitch Grinder can't die.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.551
He means too much to you.

09:12.553 --> 09:14.719
He means too much to America.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.588
What are you saying, Stew?

09:16.590 --> 09:18.590
I'm saying we need to stop this.

09:18.592 --> 09:21.927
We need to save The Grinder.

09:21.929 --> 09:25.263
Dean's contracts with
the Fox Broadcasting Corporation

09:25.265 --> 09:27.499
for<i> The Grinder,</i>
all eight seasons.

09:27.501 --> 09:29.034
Find something.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.335
What are we looking for?
Anything, Todd.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.170
A loophole, language...

09:32.172 --> 09:33.939
anything to stop Bemis

09:33.941 --> 09:36.074
from killing Mitch Grinder.
And why are we doing this?

09:36.076 --> 09:38.043
To keep alive the option
for Dean to go back to the show.

09:38.045 --> 09:40.412
Got it.
Let's get to work.
What?
He's going back?

09:40.414 --> 09:41.846
Well, no...
I mean, he's not... not now.

09:41.848 --> 09:43.281
Wow, it's hard to make sense

09:43.283 --> 09:46.117
of my emotions right now,
because as a fan, I'm excited,

09:46.119 --> 09:47.752
but I don't know,

09:47.754 --> 09:49.020
I-I don't want to lose him.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.122
Yeah. Maybe I don't want
to find a loophole.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.958
Guys, we all love having Dean
be a part of this law firm.

09:52.960 --> 09:53.960
Yes. All of us.

09:53.961 --> 09:54.926
Believe me,

09:54.928 --> 09:56.428
I would love nothing more

09:56.430 --> 09:58.730
than to burn these contracts
and have Dean here forever.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.899
But we can't let
The Grinder die.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.601
Right? For the...

10:02.603 --> 10:06.037
the legacy, or...
whatever, of... of the show?

10:06.039 --> 10:08.573
As much as I hate to say it,
I think he has a point.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.075
It would be selfish.

10:10.077 --> 10:12.077
I mean, we have to think
of Dean here.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.813
Exactly. This character
is a part of Dean,

10:14.815 --> 10:16.314
and we have to protect it.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.284
Todd...

10:19.286 --> 10:20.819
what do you say we get to work?

10:20.821 --> 10:23.088
Yeah, okay.

10:23.090 --> 10:23.989
Yeah.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.057
¶ ¶

10:29.763 --> 10:30.829
Nothing here!

10:30.831 --> 10:32.111
(grunts)

10:34.901 --> 10:36.001
Wait a minute.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.204
I think I got something.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.507
The Caruso Deal.

10:42.509 --> 10:45.276
Or did you forget
that I renegotiated for that?

10:45.278 --> 10:46.511
Yeah, I remember.

10:46.513 --> 10:47.779
Season seven.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.314
You came in whining about

10:49.316 --> 10:51.282
how you wanted the same deal
as David Caruso.

10:51.284 --> 10:53.518
What about it?
I found something in it.

10:53.520 --> 10:54.786
Didn't even know it was there.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.788
There's a clause, Cliff.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.356
Clause-Cliff. I like that.
Can I use that?

10:58.358 --> 10:59.958
Yeah, sure.
That's good.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.626
Apparently,

11:01.628 --> 11:04.129
Caruso felt that since he
had become the character,

11:04.131 --> 11:05.997
he was entitled to
partial ownership of him.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.666
DEAN: And that
he couldn't be killed

11:07.668 --> 11:09.834
without Caruso's permission,

11:09.836 --> 11:11.503
so long as he was alive.

11:11.505 --> 11:13.138
You can't kill him, Cliff...

11:13.140 --> 11:14.973
unless you're planning on
killing me first.

11:14.975 --> 11:17.809
Are you big-dogging me,
Sanderson?

11:17.811 --> 11:20.211
I can do whatever I want.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.313
I birthed Mitchard Grinder.

11:22.315 --> 11:25.483
If I want to kill him,
I'm gonna kill him.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.285
Well, that's where
you and I disagree, sir.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.487
Because this contract
clearly states

11:29.489 --> 11:31.222
that you have to shoot
a version of the scene

11:31.224 --> 11:33.158
that Dean signs off on.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.660
Look, I just think that
the character deserves better.

11:35.662 --> 11:38.063
And I know that somewhere,
deep down inside,

11:38.065 --> 11:39.230
you do, too.

11:39.232 --> 11:40.365
STEWART: Think of all
the possibilities.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.900
I mean, I'm-I'm no writer,

11:41.902 --> 11:43.802
but I'm just thinking
maybe Mitch goes off

11:43.804 --> 11:45.503
and becomes a judge.

11:45.505 --> 11:46.671
You know, in the, um,

11:46.673 --> 11:48.506
in the Florida Keys.

11:48.508 --> 11:49.874
DEAN:
And maybe he runs

11:49.876 --> 11:51.342
a Cuban nightclub
on the weekends.

11:51.344 --> 11:54.913
Yeah! You know,
and we see the salsa music

11:54.915 --> 11:56.748
as a character.
Yeah.

11:58.685 --> 12:00.518
So he works hard and plays hard.

12:00.520 --> 12:01.686
Hard is all he knows.

12:01.688 --> 12:03.188
By day, he wears a black robe,

12:03.190 --> 12:04.456
by night, a white linen shirt.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.392
To some, he's a hero;
To others...

12:07.394 --> 12:08.727
Well, it depends on
which woman you ask,

12:08.729 --> 12:10.228
am I right?

12:10.230 --> 12:11.730
And the only thing
hotter than the night

12:11.732 --> 12:13.631
is his affair with Lady Justice.

12:15.569 --> 12:16.935
All right.

12:18.605 --> 12:20.071
I like the world.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.240
If that's the scene
you want to shoot,

12:22.242 --> 12:24.676
that's the scene we shoot.

12:26.713 --> 12:28.713
On one condition.

12:28.715 --> 12:31.549
Oh, this one?
Calls for shirtless, Cliff.

12:31.551 --> 12:32.684
No argument here.

12:33.687 --> 12:35.453
Then you got a deal.

12:40.393 --> 12:41.926
Hey, do you know
where Uncle Dean is?

12:41.928 --> 12:43.762
I have a bit of a problem.
I don't know where he is,

12:43.764 --> 12:44.963
but I'm here. What's up?

12:44.965 --> 12:46.598
Uncle Dean said
I could invite Brie

12:46.600 --> 12:48.299
to his<i> Grinder</i> filming.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.068
Then Zoe found out,

12:50.070 --> 12:51.270
and now she wants to go, too.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.271
Again, I-I would go
with the honest talk.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.406
You know, just tell Zoe

12:55.408 --> 12:57.542
that you already invited Brie
and you can't bring them both.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.644
DEAN: Or... you<i> can</i>
bring them both.

12:59.646 --> 13:01.279
That way, you've got your backup
already there.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.447
You think?
Dude,

13:02.449 --> 13:03.581
a week ago, you didn't have
a girlfriend.

13:03.583 --> 13:04.783
Now you got two.

13:04.785 --> 13:07.118
I don't think that's
the right thing.
Smart.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.253
I'll do that.
Thanks.

13:08.255 --> 13:09.654
Hey.

13:09.656 --> 13:11.156
The new script arrived.

13:11.158 --> 13:13.091
Very exciting.
Oh.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.660
Uh, that is exciting.
Yep.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.629
I'm a judge in
the Florida Keys...
Great!

13:17.631 --> 13:19.631
Running my
Cuban nightclub...
Perfect.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.332
And...

13:21.334 --> 13:23.334
living with my black girlfriend.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.336
Great.
That's just what you wanted.

13:25.338 --> 13:26.437
Is music a character?

13:26.439 --> 13:28.306
Did-did he put the salsa
in there?

13:28.308 --> 13:30.408
Or is it what<i> you</i> wanted?

13:30.410 --> 13:33.178
What do you mean?
When we met with Bemis,

13:33.180 --> 13:35.980
we never said

13:35.982 --> 13:38.349
"black girlfriend."

13:38.351 --> 13:40.451
You... you sure?

13:40.453 --> 13:42.687
You are the only person
that I've ever shared that with.

13:42.689 --> 13:45.123
He must've just...
come up with it on his own.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.324
I mean, you're The Grinder,

13:46.326 --> 13:47.826
so of course
you'd have a girlfriend.

13:47.828 --> 13:50.195
And it's not a big leap
to "black."

13:50.197 --> 13:52.130
I mean, I could see how he,
how he got there.
No.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.531
Bemis never uses diversity

13:53.533 --> 13:55.800
unless he's pressured
by the network.

13:55.802 --> 13:57.669
This was your idea.

13:57.671 --> 13:59.671
And all this time, I
thought you were helping me

13:59.673 --> 14:01.039
because you cared
about The Grinder.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.674
You're just leaving
the door open

14:02.676 --> 14:04.976
so maybe I go back to the show
and get out of your hair!

14:04.978 --> 14:06.811
Okay. Yes.

14:06.813 --> 14:08.146
You got me.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.480
But, Dean,

14:09.482 --> 14:11.015
you've been here for months.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.317
And-and you've moved
into my house

14:12.319 --> 14:13.818
and you've invaded work

14:13.820 --> 14:15.153
and you're giving my son
girl advice...

14:15.155 --> 14:16.688
Well, if you didn't
like the advice,

14:16.690 --> 14:18.189
you should've said something.
I did!

14:18.191 --> 14:19.490
I said something!

14:19.492 --> 14:20.859
And no one listens to me.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.827
So, if I'm being honest, yeah.

14:22.829 --> 14:24.863
Sometimes, I, too, take comfort

14:24.865 --> 14:26.698
in knowing that
The Grinder's out there,

14:26.700 --> 14:29.067
so we can give him a call
if things don't work out here.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.536
Fine.

14:31.538 --> 14:32.837
I'll shoot the scene.

14:32.839 --> 14:34.339
And if it leads

14:34.341 --> 14:36.341
to another series
in Los Angeles...

14:36.343 --> 14:38.676
Probably with Long Beach
doubling the Florida Keys...

14:38.678 --> 14:39.978
So be it.

14:43.083 --> 14:46.551
First my TV brother
stabs me in the back,

14:46.553 --> 14:48.519
and now my real one.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.588
I don't know
which one hurts worse.

14:57.197 --> 14:59.497
(sighs)

14:59.499 --> 15:01.733
I've given it some thought.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.101
It's the real one.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.044
Whoa. This is crazy.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.545
Well, this is
New Orleans, honey.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.114
Hey, did you apologize
to your brother yet?

15:16.116 --> 15:17.382
I tried,

15:17.384 --> 15:19.083
but he was Mitch this morning,

15:19.085 --> 15:20.885
and, you know, Mitch doesn't
know who I am, so...

15:20.887 --> 15:22.887
God, that commitment level is...
Impressive, right?

15:22.889 --> 15:24.389
Pretty impressive.
Yeah.
It's amazing.

15:24.391 --> 15:26.391
(slurps)
WOMAN:
Quiet, people.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.960
How you doing, Dean?

15:30.897 --> 15:32.230
Dean?

15:32.232 --> 15:33.798
Rake, it's Mitch.

15:34.901 --> 15:36.067
Your brother.

15:36.069 --> 15:38.236
Damn. Such a pro.

15:38.238 --> 15:39.537
You're already in character.

15:39.539 --> 15:40.872
I'm sorry, I'm in what?

15:40.874 --> 15:42.273
It's kind of a relief, actually.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.042
I thought I was gonna
have to apologize

15:44.044 --> 15:45.476
for stealing your show.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.312
I'll see you on the dance floor.

15:49.616 --> 15:50.615
You ought to get back there.
This stuff's free.

15:50.617 --> 15:51.783
(bell rings)

15:51.785 --> 15:53.818
WOMAN: Quiet all around!
TODD: I hate to admit it,

15:53.820 --> 15:55.553
but Olyphant's got something.

15:55.555 --> 15:56.788
Yes, he certainly does.

15:56.790 --> 15:57.956
WOMAN:
Let's roll, please.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.223
(clears throat)

15:59.225 --> 16:01.092
BEMIS:
Ready, and...

16:01.094 --> 16:02.094
action!

16:02.095 --> 16:03.628
Rake, even though

16:03.630 --> 16:06.965
you're my younger brother, you
were always a bigger brother,

16:06.967 --> 16:10.234
and I know the firm will be
in better hands with you

16:10.236 --> 16:11.836
than it ever
could've been with me.

16:11.838 --> 16:13.338
But, Mitch...

16:13.340 --> 16:15.773
everything I learned
I learned from you.

16:15.775 --> 16:19.110
I need to leave this place

16:19.112 --> 16:22.280
and focus on being a judge
in the Florida Keys

16:22.282 --> 16:25.016
and my nightclub.

16:25.018 --> 16:27.685
And, of course... Shondy.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.487
She's beautiful, Mitch.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.090
It's time for me to get out
of your way, little brother,

16:32.092 --> 16:35.493
so that you can live
free of the shadow of...

16:35.495 --> 16:36.761
RAKE:
A legend?

16:36.763 --> 16:38.029
Take care of my team.

16:38.031 --> 16:39.031
RAKE:
Yeah.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.765
(sighs)
This is wrong.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.533
Oh, yeah, I know.
This is really bad.

16:42.535 --> 16:43.535
He didn't want this.

16:43.536 --> 16:44.869
I-I pushed him into it.

16:44.871 --> 16:45.970
So tell him.
How?

16:45.972 --> 16:47.038
He's in the middle of the scene.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.039
You know he doesn't
break character.

16:48.041 --> 16:50.875
I guess you'll
just have to wait.

16:50.877 --> 16:52.877
GRINDER: Even though
leaving may not be

16:52.879 --> 16:56.014
the best thing for me,
I need to do it.

16:56.016 --> 16:59.083
Because it's the
best thing for you.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.886
I gotta do something.

17:03.289 --> 17:06.624
I guess the only thing
left to say...

17:06.626 --> 17:08.026
is good-bye.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.060
No, it's not!

17:09.062 --> 17:10.328
(people murmuring)
What the hell?

17:10.330 --> 17:12.030
Get out of my scene!
One second.

17:12.032 --> 17:14.065
Oh, my God.
Is that your dad?

17:14.067 --> 17:15.967
I don't know who that is.
GRINDER: What's going on here?

17:15.969 --> 17:18.302
Who let this man
into the courtroom?

17:18.304 --> 17:19.137
Bailiff?

17:19.139 --> 17:20.004
What-what is happening?

17:20.006 --> 17:21.006
I have no idea.

17:21.007 --> 17:22.707
You're making a mistake, Mitch.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.075
How would you know?

17:24.077 --> 17:25.743
You don't even know me.

17:25.745 --> 17:27.712
Yes, I do.

17:27.714 --> 17:28.846
Because...

17:28.848 --> 17:30.415
I'm your brother.

17:30.417 --> 17:31.916
This is my brother... Rake.

17:31.918 --> 17:33.317
Hey.

17:33.319 --> 17:35.653
Hi. I, um...

17:35.655 --> 17:36.888
I-I know that,

17:36.890 --> 17:40.691
but I'm your other brother...

17:40.693 --> 17:42.093
Barry Grinder.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.261
Oh, my God.
What is he doing?

17:43.263 --> 17:44.062
I...

17:44.064 --> 17:45.997
"Barry Grinder"?
Mm-hmm.

17:45.999 --> 17:47.665
GRINDER:
You mean the baby

17:47.667 --> 17:49.000
that my mom...
Our mom.

17:49.002 --> 17:51.169
Our mom said died in childbirth?

17:51.171 --> 17:52.537
Yeah.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.272
Only I didn't die.

17:54.274 --> 17:57.508
I... I grew up.

17:57.510 --> 17:58.543
Evil.

17:58.545 --> 17:59.844
Wow.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.612
And that's why I slipped

18:01.614 --> 18:03.881
rat poison into
your drink earlier.

18:03.883 --> 18:06.384
And you're going to be dead...

18:06.386 --> 18:07.418
any minute now.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.423
So you want me to die?

18:12.425 --> 18:14.358
Yes, I do.

18:16.529 --> 18:19.764
But you know, if I leave
this world behind,

18:19.766 --> 18:21.966
there is no going back.

18:21.968 --> 18:23.468
I know.

18:23.470 --> 18:26.030
But it's the only way
out of this mess.

18:47.894 --> 18:51.229
I think I can feel the poison
starting to take effect.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.431
That fits my timeline perfectly.

18:53.433 --> 18:56.167
Of when I gave you that poison.

18:56.169 --> 18:58.803
GRINDER:
I'll see you in a better place.

18:58.805 --> 19:02.006
Grinder... rests.

19:03.943 --> 19:06.978
In peace.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.182
Cut?

19:11.184 --> 19:13.151
(bell rings)
WOMAN: Cut.
Right? Right?

19:13.153 --> 19:14.619
I thought it was about right.

19:14.621 --> 19:15.786
Some good stuff in there,
I thought, at the end.

19:15.788 --> 19:18.089
Guys, that was, uh...

19:18.091 --> 19:20.091
some truly repulsive stuff.

19:20.093 --> 19:21.259
I thought it was truthful.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.460
You know what?
Here's a thought.

19:22.462 --> 19:23.961
Let's, uh, let's do one more

19:23.963 --> 19:25.163
and maybe you don't pop in

19:25.165 --> 19:27.131
and ruin the whole thing.
No, Cliff.

19:27.133 --> 19:28.299
Mitch is dead.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.468
Dean, I can't use any of that.

19:30.470 --> 19:31.502
Then kill him another way.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.304
I sign off on it.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.586
Do whatever you want.

19:41.147 --> 19:43.114
Hi.

19:43.116 --> 19:44.515
Hi.

19:44.517 --> 19:45.983
Hi.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.785
Stew, that was terrible.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.987
What makes you think
you can do what he does?

19:49.989 --> 19:52.223
You're a lawyer.
You can't just become an actor.

19:52.225 --> 19:53.391
DEAN:
It is true.

19:53.393 --> 19:54.593
I did go to school for this.

20:02.235 --> 20:04.135
RAKE:
That's him, Coroner.

20:04.137 --> 20:06.304
That's my brother.

20:06.306 --> 20:07.705
Do you think he was in pain?

20:07.707 --> 20:09.140
They say when a crocodile

20:09.142 --> 20:11.309
goes into its death roll,
the spine collapses on itself.

20:11.311 --> 20:12.677
You don't feel a thing.

20:12.679 --> 20:15.413
(crying):
How are we gonna get past this?

20:15.415 --> 20:16.914
How will we ever...

20:16.916 --> 20:18.649
move on?

20:18.651 --> 20:19.951
It's gonna be hard.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.220
Gonna be?

20:23.156 --> 20:25.523
Or already is?

20:25.525 --> 20:27.758
Coroner Reyes...

20:31.030 --> 20:32.270
could you give us the room?

20:34.667 --> 20:37.435
I don't think
I can do this alone.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.570
No one is asking you to.

20:47.614 --> 20:48.879
(TV clicks off)

20:48.881 --> 20:50.214
I mean... wow.

20:50.216 --> 20:52.283
Right?
Yeah.

20:52.285 --> 20:54.018
Should we, um...
Watch it again?

20:54.020 --> 20:56.187
You know, I think twice
in one night's probably enough.

20:56.189 --> 20:58.356
But I was talking
about moving into the...

20:58.358 --> 20:59.557
Mmm!

20:59.559 --> 21:00.858
Yeah, no. In a sec.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.560
Real quick:
How much better

21:02.562 --> 21:03.694
than the original
do you think it is?

21:03.696 --> 21:05.796
Oh. Considerably better.

21:05.798 --> 21:06.864
In what ways?

21:06.866 --> 21:09.533
Um...
People watch it,

21:09.535 --> 21:11.736
and they say, "Oh, that's
just Tim being Tim."

21:11.738 --> 21:13.204
But that's not Tim.

21:13.206 --> 21:14.405
You know? This...

21:14.407 --> 21:18.209
is... Tim.

21:18.211 --> 21:20.911
Or... is it?

21:20.913 --> 21:22.213
I don't know.

21:22.215 --> 21:23.881
This is what I'm
struggling with.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.716
This is what we need
to figure out.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.251
Tonight?

21:27.253 --> 21:29.120
Um, I have a really
long day tomorrow,

21:29.122 --> 21:32.957
and if this is gonna happen,
it should probably happen now,

21:32.959 --> 21:34.925
or we should say good night.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.460
You okay with that?

21:37.830 --> 21:40.231
Not only am I okay with it,

21:40.233 --> 21:42.300
I respect the hell out of it.

21:42.302 --> 21:44.068
Good.
