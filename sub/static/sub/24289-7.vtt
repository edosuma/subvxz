00:38.455 --> 00:39.665
Yeah, nice one, man.

00:51.635 --> 00:53.762
Hey, superstar.
Ready for the big game?

00:53.845 --> 00:57.057
Can't wait to watch you kick
some serious Vic High butt!

00:57.140 --> 00:58.684
I don't know about that.

00:58.767 --> 00:59.977
Vikeye's pretty good.

01:02.521 --> 01:04.355
And the Codebreakers...

01:05.857 --> 01:07.526
Well, we're still a work
in progress.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.046
Yeah, but 'cause of you the team
hasn't lost a game all season,

01:10.070 --> 01:12.072
so that's pretty good progress.

01:12.155 --> 01:14.275
And I'm impressed with how
you're handling everything.

01:14.324 --> 01:17.077
School, basketball,
extracurricular protection

01:17.160 --> 01:18.912
of a cyber dimension.

01:18.996 --> 01:20.080
Thanks.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.165
I just wish my dad saw it that way.

01:22.249 --> 01:24.584
He's still on my case
about grades and stuff.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.174
Go, Codebreakers!

01:31.258 --> 01:32.634
Codebreakers rule!

01:32.718 --> 01:33.969
Codebreakers!
Codebreakers!

01:34.052 --> 01:34.886
Codebreakers!

01:34.970 --> 01:36.346
We better go settle her down.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.556
Have a good game, Trey.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.266
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.393
Don't worry about your dad.

01:41.476 --> 01:42.602
Thanks, man.

01:42.686 --> 01:43.520
Codebreakers!

01:43.603 --> 01:44.438
Codebreakers!

01:44.521 --> 01:46.148
Save it for the game, Vera.

01:46.231 --> 01:47.107
Why?

01:47.190 --> 01:48.543
The Codebreakers need
all the encouragement

01:48.567 --> 01:50.652
that they can get.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.195
She has a point.

01:53.238 --> 01:55.407
Hi. You're Trey's dad, right?

01:55.490 --> 01:58.452
I'm Austin, this is Parker,
Tamra and Vera.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.037
We're Trey's friends.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.247
Yes, of course.

02:02.331 --> 02:04.207
He told me all about you.

02:04.291 --> 02:08.628
You're the video game bunch
that keep Trey from his studies.

02:12.633 --> 02:13.800
Get in here, guys.

02:15.218 --> 02:18.972
All right, I wanna stick
to the game plan.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.933
Every play runs through Trey.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.268
Got it?

02:38.492 --> 02:41.703
Sentinels, take your positions.

02:41.787 --> 02:43.455
We will storm Virusylum

02:43.538 --> 02:47.292
and release all the viruses within it.

02:47.376 --> 02:49.002
Load the cyber catapult.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.175
Fire!

03:03.600 --> 03:04.601
What's up, Vera?

03:04.684 --> 03:05.936
A Megabyte alert.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.312
We have to go.

03:07.396 --> 03:09.398
Great timing, Megadoofus.

03:13.110 --> 03:14.820
Codebreakers on three.

03:14.903 --> 03:15.904
One, two, three...

03:15.987 --> 03:16.988
Codebreakers!

03:17.072 --> 03:18.073
Let's go.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.610
We haven't identified where
the corruption is coming from.

03:55.694 --> 03:56.778
It must be the Sorcerer.

03:56.862 --> 03:58.947
Only a lunatic would
attack Virusylum.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.449
There's no sign of dark code.

04:00.532 --> 04:01.825
Not yet.

04:02.868 --> 04:05.620
I'm sure he's got plenty
of tricks up his sleeve.

04:07.038 --> 04:08.999
Megabyte's surprise attack
on Virusylum

04:09.082 --> 04:11.668
caught the Department of
Internet Security off guard.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.271
Let's get in there
and give them a hand.

04:13.295 --> 04:15.839
Yeah, all those viruses
getting sprung loose?

04:15.922 --> 04:17.089
We can't let that happen.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.175
What about Trey's game?

04:18.257 --> 04:20.010
We ll be back before half-time.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.308
Go, Guardians!

04:32.189 --> 04:34.107
Okay, let's get to Virusylum.

04:40.989 --> 04:43.700
I'll take us on a wide approach
to stay out of sight.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.586
The DIS are holding them off.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.046
We might get a free shot.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.047
Good call, Enigma.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.673
I have Megabyte in my sights.

04:58.757 --> 04:59.674
Got it, Googz?

04:59.758 --> 05:00.801
Dead center.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.886
Locking on target.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.596
Hold it steady, Enigma.

05:04.679 --> 05:09.100
Double blast, Googz,
in three, two, one!

05:19.569 --> 05:20.946
Look at this.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.531
It's that mystery code again.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.199
Keep tracking it.

05:26.493 --> 05:27.953
Unreal!

05:28.036 --> 05:30.038
I don't believe it.

05:30.121 --> 05:31.873
Did we just frag Megabyte?

05:31.957 --> 05:33.583
Score one for the good guys!

05:33.667 --> 05:34.667
Yes!

06:08.994 --> 06:10.745
Yeah! There we go!

06:16.126 --> 06:17.627
Where are they?

06:18.378 --> 06:19.689
<i>Congratulations,
Guardians.</i>

06:19.713 --> 06:21.881
<i>Hurry back to catch
the rest of Trey's game.</i>

06:22.173 --> 06:23.008
Awesome!

06:23.091 --> 06:24.217
Let's go.

06:24.301 --> 06:25.301
Wait.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.804
What if we make a little
detour first?

06:27.887 --> 06:29.931
I don't like where this is going.

06:30.015 --> 06:31.895
Look, the sentinels are out here
getting spanked

06:31.933 --> 06:33.059
by the DIS patrol.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.537
It's the perfect opportunity
to take care

06:34.561 --> 06:36.521
of some unfinished business
in the fortress.

06:36.605 --> 06:38.565
What unfinished business?

06:38.648 --> 06:40.358
The sphere we left behind.

06:40.442 --> 06:42.902
You mean the sphere
you left behind?

06:42.986 --> 06:44.654
It could answer a lot of questions

06:44.738 --> 06:47.574
about what we're up against,

06:47.657 --> 06:49.075
about my dad.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.160
Fine.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.079
We'll be in and out, I promise.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.464
The Virusylum attack seems
to be under control now.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.257
No viruses were released.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.551
What happened to the code
we were tracking?

07:06.635 --> 07:08.970
It just vanished, like it's done before.

07:09.054 --> 07:10.281
This is the first time
we've seen it

07:10.305 --> 07:12.140
without the presence of dark code.

07:12.223 --> 07:14.726
But you still think it's
connected to the Sorcerer?

07:14.809 --> 07:17.812
Yes. Somehow.

07:17.896 --> 07:20.732
My gut tells me he was involved
in this attack.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.527
<i>A massive release of viruses.</i>

07:24.611 --> 07:26.279
<i>An outbreak. A plague.</i>

07:26.363 --> 07:29.491
<i>It would have been devastating,
but your replicant failed.</i>

07:29.574 --> 07:30.909
<i>It was inferior.</i>

07:30.992 --> 07:32.535
<i>Sub-par.</i>

07:32.619 --> 07:33.995
<i>Flawed.</i>

07:34.079 --> 07:38.959
Well, this experiment is still
in the beta testing phase.

07:39.042 --> 07:42.170
As I've pointed out,
replicating perfection

07:42.253 --> 07:44.255
is easier said than done.

07:44.339 --> 07:46.466
<i>You're holding back.</i>

07:46.549 --> 07:49.511
<i>I want Megabyte replicants
at full potential.</i>

07:49.594 --> 07:50.594
<i>Nothing less.</i>

07:50.637 --> 07:52.263
<i>Maximum strength.</i>

07:52.347 --> 07:54.140
Yes, of course.

07:54.224 --> 07:58.228
But doing so will drain far
too much of my own power.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.689
Only temporarily.

08:00.772 --> 08:03.483
A much better option than

08:03.566 --> 08:06.236
deletion, don't you think?

08:11.616 --> 08:13.076
Enough!

08:13.159 --> 08:14.869
I will do it!

08:18.123 --> 08:19.541
<i>What was that?</i>

08:21.960 --> 08:24.129
I will do what you ask.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.547
Of course you will.

08:45.150 --> 08:46.317
That was impressive.

08:46.401 --> 08:48.820
Thanks.
Sneak attacks are my specialty.

08:48.903 --> 08:49.779
That's for sure.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.823
Come on, in and out like I said.

08:53.950 --> 08:54.951
Hmm.

08:55.035 --> 08:59.247
Maximum replication power or deletion?

08:59.330 --> 09:01.291
Maximum power it is.

09:03.376 --> 09:06.629
Oh, the indignities I must suffer.

09:20.643 --> 09:21.686
Okay, Googz.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.104
Light it up.

09:26.149 --> 09:28.610
There.
The sphere is in the throne.

09:30.612 --> 09:31.529
What the...

09:31.613 --> 09:33.156
Not possible.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.450
We fragged you back
at Virusylum.

09:35.533 --> 09:36.576
We all saw it.

09:36.659 --> 09:37.911
You blew up real good.

09:37.994 --> 09:41.039
You must have me confused
with another virus.

09:48.046 --> 09:48.880
What?

09:48.963 --> 09:51.633
Another Megabyte?

09:51.716 --> 09:52.967
Double trouble!

09:53.051 --> 09:55.053
Code disruptor!

09:59.724 --> 10:00.892
No way!

10:00.975 --> 10:03.520
Ugh. Make that triple trouble.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.981
You Guardians are becoming
quite a nuisance.

10:07.065 --> 10:11.194
What have I told you about
dropping by unannounced?

10:11.277 --> 10:13.655
Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

10:18.576 --> 10:22.122
Do I have your attention now?

10:22.205 --> 10:24.040
More or less.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.959
Rip them to shreds!

10:28.336 --> 10:29.420
Too slow.

10:29.504 --> 10:30.839
Look up!

10:43.560 --> 10:45.061
You missed me.

10:47.230 --> 10:48.415
Dude, that was awesome!

10:48.439 --> 10:49.440
Thanks.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.364
It was just basic trajectory
converter mapping.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.945
Sentinels, finish them!

10:54.028 --> 10:55.280
Firewall!

11:22.348 --> 11:23.348
Yes!

11:29.564 --> 11:30.398
Yeah!

11:30.481 --> 11:31.691
There you go!

11:35.320 --> 11:37.864
Now that's how you end
the half strong!

11:39.115 --> 11:40.783
Good work out there, guys.

11:45.288 --> 11:47.832
Hey, Trey!

11:47.916 --> 11:49.000
Locker room's that way.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.043
I know, coach.
I just gotta go check on something.

11:51.085 --> 11:51.920
Hey.

11:52.003 --> 11:53.588
What's this about, son?

11:54.797 --> 11:56.424
Nothing. I'll be right back.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.051
Hey! Hey. Now, slow down.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.987
Now what could be so important
that you'd leave your teammates

12:00.011 --> 12:01.721
in the middle of a game?

12:01.930 --> 12:03.389
You wouldn't understand.

12:03.473 --> 12:06.142
It's those video game
delinquents, isn't it?

12:06.225 --> 12:08.227
They didn't even stick around
to watch the game.

12:08.311 --> 12:11.356
I'm telling you right now
they are a bad influence.

12:11.439 --> 12:14.067
You don't know them.

12:14.317 --> 12:16.402
They're my friends.

12:24.118 --> 12:25.286
What's happening, Vera?

12:25.536 --> 12:27.372
Why'd you guys leave the game?

12:27.455 --> 12:28.790
And where is everybody?

12:28.873 --> 12:30.541
Vector, Enigma and Googz
are under attack

12:30.625 --> 12:31.793
in Megabyte's fortress.

12:31.876 --> 12:32.752
What?

12:32.835 --> 12:35.713
He's making replicants of himself.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.632
Multiple Megabytes?

12:37.715 --> 12:39.384
I'm going in.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.552
What about the Codebreakers?

12:41.636 --> 12:42.655
Won't there be consequences

12:42.679 --> 12:44.847
if you miss the second half of the game?

12:44.931 --> 12:48.059
Yeah. 100 percent probability.

12:48.142 --> 12:51.396
But some things are more
important than basketball.

12:59.070 --> 13:00.631
I can't keep this up much longer.

13:00.655 --> 13:02.824
Enigma, hyperlink
behind the sentinels.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.659
Then Googz, drop the firewall

13:04.742 --> 13:06.494
and we'll hit them from both sides.

13:06.577 --> 13:07.745
Got it.

13:07.829 --> 13:08.829
Hunh!

13:17.046 --> 13:19.882
Or DFrag could just show up
out of nowhere and do that.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.844
I heard Megabyte was being
a mega pain.

13:22.927 --> 13:23.927
That's for sure.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.513
He went this way. Come on!

13:34.188 --> 13:37.191
Impressive specimens, indeed.

13:37.275 --> 13:41.154
But generating them drains me so.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.877
Looks like Megabyte's been busy.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.949
We have to stop him
from making more replicants.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.034
Yeah.

13:46.117 --> 13:48.327
And shut down the replicator
for good this time.

13:48.411 --> 13:49.412
Leave it to me.

13:49.495 --> 13:52.957
Destroy them!

13:53.041 --> 13:55.126
Yeah, this is gonna be sweet!

13:57.628 --> 13:59.005
Power surge!

14:03.259 --> 14:04.260
No!

14:06.429 --> 14:08.681
Now that's what I call
a four-point play.

14:08.765 --> 14:09.766
Yes!

14:11.434 --> 14:12.268
Uh-oh.

14:12.351 --> 14:13.352
Not done yet.

14:13.436 --> 14:14.955
You guys deal with
the sentinels.

14:14.979 --> 14:16.379
I'm gonna get what
we came here for.

14:16.439 --> 14:17.982
Zip board!

14:26.449 --> 14:27.784
Yes!

14:28.409 --> 14:29.243
Got it!

14:29.327 --> 14:32.163
Meet your demise, Guardian.

14:34.999 --> 14:35.999
Vector!

14:36.834 --> 14:37.919
My arm!

14:40.838 --> 14:42.465
<i>Vector suit breech.</i>

14:42.548 --> 14:46.886
20 percent.

14:47.845 --> 14:48.679
Oh, man.

14:48.763 --> 14:50.098
We gotta close up that rip.

14:50.181 --> 14:51.349
Cyber sealer.

14:54.727 --> 14:55.871
That should stop the exposure.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.647
Thanks. I owe you one for sure.

14:57.730 --> 14:58.731
Let's get outta here.

14:58.815 --> 15:01.401
Googz, Enigma,
meet us on the tower.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.200
Ah.

15:09.283 --> 15:13.037
This sphere seems to be of
great interest to the Guardians.

15:15.748 --> 15:20.294
Surely they will attempt
to retrieve it again.

15:20.378 --> 15:22.088
What is this?

15:25.591 --> 15:27.510
Hmm.

15:34.392 --> 15:36.394
Austin? Are you all right?

15:37.728 --> 15:40.064
Yeah, I'm fine.

15:40.189 --> 15:41.691
It's just a small cut.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.776
Yeah, but it could have been
a lot worse.

15:45.236 --> 15:46.404
Hey.

15:46.487 --> 15:49.323
What's happening in the game?

15:49.407 --> 15:51.117
The Codebreakers are losing
by five points

15:51.200 --> 15:53.494
with 36 seconds left
in the fourth quarter.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.037
Oh, man, I gotta go!

15:59.208 --> 16:01.048
All right, now work it around
for an open look.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.713
If we don't score,
foul right away, all right?

16:03.796 --> 16:05.548
Don't worry, I'll score.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.550
And where have you been?

16:07.967 --> 16:09.218
Huh?

16:10.094 --> 16:11.554
You know what? Never mind.

16:11.637 --> 16:12.763
Just get out there.

16:12.847 --> 16:13.681
Let's go.

16:13.764 --> 16:14.764
Let's go!

16:15.975 --> 16:16.975
You can do it!

16:43.503 --> 16:45.004
Ha ha!

16:45.129 --> 16:46.297
Yeah!

17:02.355 --> 17:03.564
Yeah!

17:10.029 --> 17:11.948
What happens now?

17:12.114 --> 17:13.241
He got fouled.

17:13.406 --> 17:16.911
If he makes this free throw, we win.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.352
Go, Codebreakers!

17:41.435 --> 17:43.062
A four-point play!

17:43.145 --> 17:44.814
His second of the day.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.319
What a comeback!

18:01.914 --> 18:03.249
It was selfish.

18:03.332 --> 18:04.834
It was inconsiderate.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.837
Do I need to continue? Because I can.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.674
How could you disappear
during the middle of a basketball game?

18:11.757 --> 18:13.426
I'm sorry, Dad.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.469
Where were you?

18:18.014 --> 18:19.515
Does it matter?

18:19.599 --> 18:22.268
I... I came back in time to win it.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.270
Oh, Trey.

18:24.353 --> 18:26.731
You think that's all I care about?

18:26.814 --> 18:28.024
Winning?

18:28.107 --> 18:30.401
This is about discipline.

18:30.484 --> 18:31.819
Commitment.

18:31.902 --> 18:34.780
Showing respect to your teammates.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.367
I'm worried about you, son.

18:38.534 --> 18:42.580
And I need you to tell me now,
where were you?

18:43.664 --> 18:45.124
He was helping me.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.919
Excuse me?

18:49.003 --> 18:51.547
I got into some trouble.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.050
It could have turned out real bad.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.969
But Trey showed up just in time.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.097
Really?

19:00.181 --> 19:01.432
Yeah.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.268
Your son kinda saved my life.

19:09.565 --> 19:10.566
I see.

19:16.447 --> 19:18.532
I'll be waiting in the car for you, son.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.877
Thanks for that.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.546
I have no idea what I would have told him.

19:32.630 --> 19:34.507
I told him the truth.

19:34.632 --> 19:38.177
I just left out a few cyber details.

19:41.097 --> 19:42.431
Inept.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.516
Incompetent.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.685
<i>How did this plan backfire, Megabyte?</i>

19:46.018 --> 19:47.019
Guardians.

19:47.103 --> 19:49.855
They are a menace.

19:49.939 --> 19:52.191
<i>And the replicator, can it be fixed?</i>

19:52.274 --> 19:53.192
<i>Repaired?</i>

19:53.275 --> 19:54.527
I'm afraid not.

19:54.610 --> 19:57.196
Fortunately I have a surplus of sentinels

19:57.279 --> 20:00.449
but unfortunately the replicants
were all destroyed.

20:00.533 --> 20:04.537
I must admit they did not
compare to the original.

20:04.620 --> 20:07.748
<i>Maybe it wasn't the replicants after all.</i>

20:08.207 --> 20:11.961
<i>Maybe the source code
was the problem.</i>

20:12.044 --> 20:14.130
But no longer.

20:18.676 --> 20:21.637
No, please!

20:21.721 --> 20:23.097
Stop!

20:23.431 --> 20:24.765
Stop!

20:29.645 --> 20:31.814
What is this red code?

20:31.897 --> 20:35.443
I injured a Guardian in battle.

20:35.526 --> 20:37.236
He leaked it.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.334
No.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.211
It can't be.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.756
Blood.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.300
Human blood.

21:02.136 --> 21:04.263
The Guardians are human.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.808
<i>Humans in cyberspace.</i>

21:15.816 --> 21:17.818
This changes everything.
