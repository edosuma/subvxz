WEBVTT

00:01.534 --> 00:04.085
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

00:04.153 --> 00:06.121
Woody's a
married man, huh? Yeah.

00:06.188 --> 00:08.156
Yeah, what a lucky guy.

00:08.224 --> 00:09.557
Indeed, he is.

00:09.625 --> 00:11.593
There's nothing
like wedded bliss.

00:11.660 --> 00:13.595
Plus, he's got
that wedding ring.

00:13.662 --> 00:16.897
Now, that is a
real babe magnet.

00:16.949 --> 00:19.017
Please, it's an old wives' tale.

00:19.085 --> 00:20.352
Not so.
Yeah?

00:20.353 --> 00:22.653
Oh, it's been scientifically
proven that women

00:22.654 --> 00:24.722
are more attracted
to married men.

00:25.758 --> 00:27.559
The whole notion is ridiculous.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.127
Look, I'll...
I'll prove it to you.

00:29.128 --> 00:31.146
You see those two attractive
young females over there?

00:31.147 --> 00:32.430
I'll go over and hit on them

00:32.432 --> 00:33.849
relentlessly, all the while

00:33.850 --> 00:35.400
displaying my wedding ring.

00:35.468 --> 00:38.570
See how long it takes them
to give me the cold shoulder.

00:48.497 --> 00:49.830
Hi.

00:49.831 --> 00:53.001
You two ladies
need some company?

00:53.002 --> 00:55.670
Oh, sure, I'm married, but, uh,
you know, I'm not dead.

00:55.671 --> 00:57.572
(laughing)

00:57.640 --> 00:59.073
I figure, well, uh...

01:06.265 --> 01:08.499
Lilith is here, isn't she?

02:27.546 --> 02:28.546
Oh, great.

02:28.547 --> 02:29.981
(laughing) Sign here, please.

02:29.982 --> 02:31.816
Hey, fellas, listen
up, you know how

02:31.817 --> 02:33.485
I've been trying to
hustle up more business

02:33.486 --> 02:34.519
for the bar?

02:34.520 --> 02:36.921
Well, I think this
baby's just the ticket.

02:37.073 --> 02:39.240
Cheers is now the proud owner

02:39.308 --> 02:41.008
of a blood pressure tester.

02:41.077 --> 02:42.577
(laughing)

02:42.644 --> 02:44.112
That's... that's
great, Sammy.

02:44.180 --> 02:45.413
I think we ought to get

02:45.498 --> 02:48.182
some velvet ropes outside
to handle the lines.

02:48.217 --> 02:49.617
No, no, come on, will you?

02:49.685 --> 02:52.319
Lighten up here,
this could be fun.

02:52.387 --> 02:53.555
What the hell is this?

02:53.622 --> 02:55.389
They sent me a slot machine.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.398
Well, I lived kind of a
sheltered girlhood, but offhand,

02:58.427 --> 03:02.196
I'd say this looks like
a Gametime model 36X

03:02.265 --> 03:05.400
with remodelled sprockets,
triple-action tumblers.

03:05.468 --> 03:06.901
"The Big Boy".

03:07.019 --> 03:08.236
(Rebecca sighs)

03:08.354 --> 03:10.972
A slot machine.
(gasps)

03:10.973 --> 03:13.608
I've never played one of these,
but I've always wanted to.

03:13.609 --> 03:14.642
Hey, hey, come on, no, don't...

03:14.643 --> 03:16.211
don't do that, please,
it's illegal.

03:16.212 --> 03:18.013
This is the last thing
this bar needs.

03:18.014 --> 03:20.184
I'm gonna call and tell
them to take it back.

03:20.249 --> 03:22.049
It's just as well, Rebecca.

03:22.118 --> 03:25.453
These are the devil's
own machines.

03:25.454 --> 03:26.871
They systematically rob you

03:26.872 --> 03:29.240
of your cash and your dignity,

03:29.308 --> 03:30.575
one nickel at a time.

03:30.643 --> 03:32.043
Allow me to demonstrate.

03:32.044 --> 03:33.461
Oh, hey, come on,
Frasier, don't do that.

03:33.462 --> 03:34.528
No, relax, Sam.

03:34.529 --> 03:36.264
This is merely for
educational purposes.

03:36.265 --> 03:37.549
Good-bye, nickel.

03:37.616 --> 03:38.783
(coin clanging)

03:41.620 --> 03:43.421
(bell ringing, coins clanging)

03:43.422 --> 03:44.372
(chortling)

03:44.373 --> 03:45.540
Free money!

03:45.558 --> 03:47.191
The doctor is hot!

03:47.259 --> 03:48.309
(laughing)

03:49.362 --> 03:50.412
Excuse me, sir.

03:50.413 --> 03:52.096
I represent a market
research company.

03:52.097 --> 03:53.147
We're doing a survey.

03:53.148 --> 03:54.366
Oh, I'm really not interested.

03:54.367 --> 03:55.567
Thanks.
Okay.

03:55.568 --> 03:56.884
How about you, sir?
Okay.

03:56.885 --> 03:58.286
We're looking for volunteers

03:58.287 --> 04:00.288
to taste several
brands of beer.

04:00.406 --> 04:01.456
Uh, excuse me, Paul,

04:01.457 --> 04:02.924
we were having
a conversation here.

04:02.925 --> 04:04.959
You were saying?
Uh, uh, well,

04:05.077 --> 04:07.629
if you're available,
just come to this address

04:07.697 --> 04:09.764
at 2:00 this afternoon.
2:00, sure.

04:09.832 --> 04:12.066
Hey, listen, uh, uh,
what exactly do I do?

04:12.084 --> 04:15.387
Well, you'll be in a room
with several other volunteers,

04:15.388 --> 04:17.922
and you'll be tasting
several varieties of beer.

04:17.923 --> 04:19.290
We'll pay you for your time.

04:19.341 --> 04:22.010
Excuse me, sir.

04:22.077 --> 04:24.545
This is gonna sound like
an odd question, but...

04:24.613 --> 04:27.448
by any chance, were
you born in a manger?

04:33.950 --> 04:38.159
You've been selected
to take part in this study

04:38.160 --> 04:40.661
due to your ages
and your drinking preferences.

04:40.729 --> 04:42.763
Norm, there seems to be a typo

04:42.832 --> 04:44.932
here on your average
beer intake.

04:48.387 --> 04:50.155
Wow.

04:50.256 --> 04:51.539
Now, gentlemen,

04:51.590 --> 04:53.508
I'd like you to each take a sip

04:53.575 --> 04:56.244
from sample A and give me
your impressions.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.547
Ray, what do you think?

04:59.548 --> 05:01.249
Would you serve this beer
in your home?

05:01.250 --> 05:03.284
Yeah, sure.

05:03.285 --> 05:04.235
And Chuck?

05:04.236 --> 05:05.953
Very tasty, uh...

05:06.972 --> 05:08.806
Good after-taste, too.

05:08.807 --> 05:09.907
And Norm.

05:09.908 --> 05:11.408
I don't know.

05:11.477 --> 05:13.010
Didn't you just drink some?

05:13.011 --> 05:14.512
Yeah, but it wasn't in my mouth

05:14.513 --> 05:16.113
long enough to really taste it.

05:17.867 --> 05:19.867
Hold it in your mouth
a little longer.

05:19.935 --> 05:21.703
Try savouring it for a second,

05:21.770 --> 05:23.137
and then swallow it.

05:26.742 --> 05:28.543
This is great.

05:28.611 --> 05:31.479
Wow, does anyone else know
about this savouring thing?

05:36.802 --> 05:38.469
Now try to describe the taste.

05:38.554 --> 05:40.922
Ah... well,
it's kind of, um, sweet,

05:40.989 --> 05:42.957
but, uh, kind of tangy, too.

05:43.025 --> 05:44.191
You know what I mean?

05:44.192 --> 05:45.326
Yeah... very
observant.

05:45.327 --> 05:47.295
Yeah.
What about sample B?

05:51.684 --> 05:53.384
It's kind of tart.

05:53.385 --> 05:56.571
Actually, I thought it
was kind of sweet.

05:56.572 --> 05:57.605
NORM:
No, no, fellas.

05:57.606 --> 05:58.573
It's really...
it's...

05:58.574 --> 06:00.241
it's more of a smoky thing.

06:00.359 --> 06:01.542
Right again.
Yeah.

06:01.610 --> 06:03.777
That's the new mash
that they're using.

06:03.845 --> 06:05.346
You're amazing, Norm.

06:07.616 --> 06:09.426
What about,
uh, sample C? Let's see.

06:12.837 --> 06:14.587
Now, this one
misses for me, okay?

06:14.588 --> 06:16.273
Mm-hmm.
It's like the carbonation is...

06:16.274 --> 06:17.775
is fighting the flavour,

06:17.793 --> 06:19.393
and the flavour is losing.

06:19.461 --> 06:21.391
This is really getting
too easy for me.

06:21.396 --> 06:23.398
You want to challenge
me a bit here?

06:24.335 --> 06:26.334
Okay.

06:26.335 --> 06:27.568
Let's try samples

06:27.603 --> 06:29.203
D through V.

06:29.204 --> 06:30.271
Oh, D through V.

06:30.272 --> 06:31.322
Now, hang on a second.

06:31.373 --> 06:33.108
I may need to
cleanse my palate.

06:33.175 --> 06:34.942
Do you have any pizza?

06:42.390 --> 06:45.520
Oh, Carla, you're not supposed

06:45.521 --> 06:47.121
to be playing that-
it's illegal.

06:47.122 --> 06:50.391
So is watering drinks.

06:50.459 --> 06:52.360
Good luck to you.

06:53.812 --> 06:56.531
(bell ringing, coins clanging)

06:56.532 --> 06:57.582
(whooping)

06:57.599 --> 06:59.033
Come to mama.

07:03.639 --> 07:06.741
(sighs):
Come on, come on, come on.

07:06.809 --> 07:09.076
Darn it, this machine hates me!

07:09.144 --> 07:11.512
Say, uh, Rebecca, uh,
can I give it a try?

07:11.580 --> 07:12.714
Go ahead, Paul.

07:12.781 --> 07:14.665
It's obviously empty.

07:19.020 --> 07:21.706
(bell ringing, coins clanging)

07:21.707 --> 07:23.090
Hey, hey.

07:23.158 --> 07:24.392
Wow.

07:25.728 --> 07:27.027
Nine nickels.

07:27.028 --> 07:29.697
Hey, I wonder, if those chicks
over there saw me win, huh?

07:29.698 --> 07:30.748
Yeah, Paul.

07:30.799 --> 07:32.489
I'm sure the lack
of that 45 cents

07:32.534 --> 07:34.402
is what kept you
out of that ménage.

07:38.173 --> 07:40.742
Come on... come on.

07:40.809 --> 07:41.959
Be there, be there.

07:42.027 --> 07:43.694
Damn!

07:43.762 --> 07:46.697
What is wrong with this machine?

07:46.765 --> 07:49.934
Frasier won, Paul won,
Carla won.

07:50.001 --> 07:52.837
Maybe it just hates women.

07:52.905 --> 07:54.221
Afternoon, everybody.

07:54.289 --> 07:56.090
CROWD:
Norm!

07:56.091 --> 07:57.308
What's the story, Norm?

07:57.309 --> 07:58.226
Boy meets beer.

07:58.227 --> 07:59.493
Boy drinks beer.

07:59.561 --> 08:01.061
Boy gets another beer.

08:01.129 --> 08:03.231
In this performance,
the role of the boy

08:03.298 --> 08:04.928
will be played by
Norm Peterson.

08:04.929 --> 08:07.168
Sammy, I want you
to pour a round

08:07.169 --> 08:08.803
for the house and
put it on my tab.

08:08.870 --> 08:10.004
Ooh.
Oh!

08:10.072 --> 08:11.122
Oh, thank you.

08:11.123 --> 08:12.207
What's the occasion there,
big guy?

08:12.208 --> 08:13.608
Well, I think I got a job.

08:13.609 --> 08:15.142
Hey, all right,
Normie. CLIFF:

08:15.143 --> 08:18.328
Stand back,
I'll take care of this.

08:18.329 --> 08:19.680
All right, mister, I don't know

08:19.681 --> 08:22.350
what pod you crawled out of...

08:22.417 --> 08:24.418
but you're not welcome
in our world.

08:24.486 --> 08:26.656
Now, go in peace and give us
our Normie back.

08:26.657 --> 08:30.675
Seriously, remember that beer
tasting survey group?

08:30.676 --> 08:32.443
Turns out they value
my opinion so much,

08:32.443 --> 08:34.477
they want me to try
out at the brewery.

08:34.546 --> 08:35.679
CLIFF:
All right.

08:35.746 --> 08:38.849
Who'd have thought I have
a knack for something?

08:38.917 --> 08:41.702
Okay, now, listen up, you.

08:41.770 --> 08:44.171
This is my last nickel.

08:44.239 --> 08:46.040
Now, I'm not asking for a lot.

08:46.108 --> 08:48.192
I-I just want you to hit,
just once.

08:48.259 --> 08:49.360
Please... for me.

08:53.999 --> 08:55.199
(crying)

08:55.266 --> 08:57.668
Why do you hate me?

08:59.237 --> 09:00.421
Becs.
What?

09:00.489 --> 09:01.539
Come here.

09:01.556 --> 09:02.673
What do you want?

09:04.676 --> 09:06.927
(whispering):
You are acting crazy.

09:06.995 --> 09:09.463
You're standing there
talking to a machine,

09:09.531 --> 09:12.199
pretending like it cares
who's feeding it nickels.

09:12.267 --> 09:15.135
It doesn't have anything
against you personally.

09:15.203 --> 09:16.337
You're right.

09:16.405 --> 09:17.455
Thank you.

09:17.506 --> 09:18.956
And why are you whispering?

09:19.891 --> 09:22.359
I don't want it to hear
me talking to you.

09:30.786 --> 09:32.720
(machines humming)

09:32.788 --> 09:35.055
Pardon me, uh, are you Mike?

09:35.056 --> 09:36.724
Hey, you must be
the new guy, Norm?

09:36.725 --> 09:38.526
Yeah, hi.
Yeah, I'll be your supervisor.

09:38.527 --> 09:39.577
Oh, great.

09:39.578 --> 09:41.896
I was, uh, looking over
your sample comments,

09:41.897 --> 09:43.030
and, uh, well,

09:43.098 --> 09:45.232
must say they're
very impressive.

09:45.300 --> 09:46.483
Thank you.
Uh, now,

09:46.484 --> 09:47.969
remember, this is just a trial,

09:47.970 --> 09:49.670
but I think
you're gonna do great.

09:49.671 --> 09:50.588
Thanks, sir.

09:50.589 --> 09:51.789
Uh, the job's very simple.

09:51.790 --> 09:53.290
You'll drink

10:06.438 --> 10:07.722

You'll be sampling beer

Are you... are you
crying, Norm?

10:19.585 --> 10:22.903
Nah, just got something
in my eye there.

10:22.971 --> 10:25.038
I'll get you a Kleenex.

Hey, Mike.

Look, if you don't mind,

11:26.918 --> 11:28.619
I'm gonna knock off
for lunch, okay?

11:28.620 --> 11:29.720
Yeah, sure.

11:29.787 --> 11:31.422
You had a great
first week, Norm.

11:31.423 --> 11:33.390
(laughs):
You don't have to tell me, sir.

11:33.391 --> 11:35.459
It was the happiest week
of my life.

11:35.527 --> 11:36.793
Here you go, Norm.

11:36.861 --> 11:38.262
Huh? What's this?

11:38.330 --> 11:40.031
It's your pay-check.

You know, you were right

about that timer being off

that's something

11:57.049 --> 11:58.315
As far as I'm concerned,

11:58.383 --> 11:59.683
the job is yours.

11:59.751 --> 12:00.984
Oh, really?
Yeah.

12:00.985 --> 12:02.753
There's-There's just
one more thing. Yeah?

12:02.754 --> 12:04.522
It's, uh... it's mostly
a formality... Yeah.

12:04.523 --> 12:07.053
But, uh, well, you have
to meet with Mr. Hoffmeyer,

12:07.054 --> 12:08.459
the president of the brewery.

12:08.460 --> 12:11.178
Now, if Hoffmeyer likes you,
well, you're all set.

12:11.245 --> 12:12.963
What kind of
guy is he? Oh, he's...

12:13.031 --> 12:14.498
a bit of a tough cookie,

12:14.499 --> 12:17.535
but, uh, if you take your work
seriously, you'll do just fine.

12:17.536 --> 12:19.803
Okay. Well, I'd be
glad to meet the guy. Good.

12:19.804 --> 12:21.505
Listen, if you don't
mind right now,

12:21.506 --> 12:23.140
I've been tasting beer
all morning, okay?

12:23.141 --> 12:25.509
So, I'm just gonna take a
break, change my clothes

12:25.510 --> 12:27.545
and go over to Cheers
and hoist a few.

12:27.579 --> 12:28.845

You're, uh...

12:28.913 --> 12:30.364
You're kidding, right?

12:30.432 --> 12:32.066
Yeah. These clothes
will be fine.

12:41.526 --> 12:43.461
Come on.
Big money.

12:49.534 --> 12:52.069
Come on.
Big money.

12:53.572 --> 12:55.372
Oh, show me I'm not a loser.

12:55.440 --> 12:58.109
Can't believe
you're still playing this thing.

12:58.176 --> 13:01.678
Sam, I have pulled
that handle 578 times,

13:01.679 --> 13:03.581
and this machine
has given me nothing.

13:03.582 --> 13:05.082
Well, may... maybe
it's broken.

13:05.150 --> 13:06.383
Let me try it here.

13:06.451 --> 13:07.851
Give me that.

13:10.888 --> 13:13.056
(coins clinking, bell dinging)

13:15.327 --> 13:17.394
No. No. It's you,
all right.

13:26.254 --> 13:29.540
Come on. Big money.

13:29.608 --> 13:32.143
I hate to see her beating
herself up like that.

13:32.210 --> 13:33.544
Yeah, I agree.

13:33.612 --> 13:36.747
If there was just some way
that she could win, even once.

13:36.814 --> 13:38.715
It might serve
to break her fatalism

13:38.783 --> 13:41.552
and bolster her self-esteem.

13:41.620 --> 13:45.422
Plus, maybe then I'd get a shot,
'cause I am hot, hot, hot!

13:45.423 --> 13:49.460
Well, there must
be some way we can fix that machine

13:49.461 --> 13:50.962
so you can win just one time.

13:51.029 --> 13:53.097
Now you're good
at this stuff, Carla.

13:53.098 --> 13:54.164
Can't you rig it?

13:54.165 --> 13:55.165
Why should I?

13:55.166 --> 13:56.300
Well, because

13:56.301 --> 13:58.102
she'd feel better
about herself,

13:58.103 --> 14:00.337
you know, maybe
even feel happy.

14:00.405 --> 14:01.822
No, really. Why should I?

14:04.293 --> 14:07.094
Because there's a $20 bill
in it for you.

14:07.162 --> 14:08.429
Deal.

14:08.496 --> 14:09.797
(chuckles)

14:09.864 --> 14:11.032
I'd have done it for ten.

14:11.099 --> 14:13.089
No wonder
you're going out of business.

14:14.769 --> 14:16.137
Afternoon, everybody.

14:16.204 --> 14:17.704
ALL:
Norm!

14:17.772 --> 14:19.473
A little busman's holiday, Norm?

14:19.541 --> 14:21.842
No. None of those fancy drinks
for me, Sammy.

14:21.910 --> 14:23.744
Just give me a beer.

14:23.812 --> 14:25.379
See this, boys?
Huh?

14:25.447 --> 14:26.547
An actual pay-check.

14:26.614 --> 14:27.949
Oh.

14:28.016 --> 14:29.550
Tell you what, Sammy.

14:29.551 --> 14:32.253
Earning a salary
does something for a guy's self-esteem.

14:32.254 --> 14:34.021
For the first time in years,

14:34.089 --> 14:36.223
I'm actually making
an honest living.

14:36.291 --> 14:37.959
Oh, look at that.

14:38.026 --> 14:40.661
This says Norm Peterman.

14:40.662 --> 14:42.129
That's 'cause Norm Peterson

14:42.130 --> 14:44.300
is still drawing
unemployment, thank you.

14:44.301 --> 14:46.801
Well, Norm, I must say
I've never seen you

14:46.802 --> 14:47.968
look happier
or-or more fulfilled.

14:47.969 --> 14:49.236
NORM:
Well, thanks, Fras.

14:49.237 --> 14:50.954
I still don't have
the job officially yet.

14:50.955 --> 14:52.923
I got to meet the
president of the brewery.

14:52.924 --> 14:55.574
But I tell you what- I feel
like I've found my calling.

14:55.575 --> 14:57.061
Yeah, that's a wonderful
feeling, isn't it? Yeah.

14:57.062 --> 14:59.292
You know, I remember
the first day I decided

14:59.297 --> 15:01.248
to go into the healing arts.

15:01.315 --> 15:05.185
Yeah, just the thought
of helping my fellow man...

15:05.253 --> 15:08.221
it gave me a sense of purpose,
a mission in life.

15:08.289 --> 15:09.556
(rhythmic beeping)

15:09.624 --> 15:10.824
Oh.

15:10.892 --> 15:12.259
Oh, surprise, surprise!

15:12.326 --> 15:14.728
Mrs. Davis.
"I had a bad childhood."

15:14.796 --> 15:17.364
Join the club, sister!

15:17.365 --> 15:20.918
I'm all out of nickels.
Does anybody have a nickel?

15:20.919 --> 15:22.820
Hey, hey, where's that, uh,
tip jar of Carla's?

15:22.821 --> 15:24.151
No.
REBECCA: Well, I would

15:24.155 --> 15:25.623
pay her back.

15:25.624 --> 15:27.808
Going a little bit
overboard here, aren't you?

15:27.809 --> 15:29.993
After all, it's just
a silly little machine.

15:29.994 --> 15:31.562
It's not a silly
machine, Norman.

15:31.563 --> 15:33.597
It is... It is a
metaphor for life.

15:33.598 --> 15:35.265
It is. Everybody gets
to pull the handle,

15:35.266 --> 15:37.584
and sometimes they win,
and sometimes they lose.

15:37.585 --> 15:40.054
But I always lose.

15:40.121 --> 15:43.039
I pull the handle, and
I get cherry, lemon,

15:43.108 --> 15:45.942
(voice breaking):
Bell!

15:45.943 --> 15:48.813
Rebecca, has it ever occurred
to you that maybe the reason

15:48.814 --> 15:51.916
you always lose is because
you think you're going to lose?

15:51.983 --> 15:53.651
Oh, don't give me that crap!

15:53.652 --> 15:55.419
I tried that positive
thinking stuff,

15:55.420 --> 15:58.556
and I knew it wouldn't work,
and sure enough, it didn't!

15:58.623 --> 16:00.591
You are over-analysing things.

16:00.659 --> 16:02.460
You got to live in the moment.

16:02.527 --> 16:04.194
Take life as it comes, okay?

16:04.262 --> 16:07.164
You start thinking too much,
everything falls apart.

16:07.232 --> 16:09.433
Norm, how do you not
think too much?

16:09.434 --> 16:10.967
You're-You're getting ready

16:10.968 --> 16:12.836
for the biggest interview
of your life!

16:12.837 --> 16:14.070
Yeah.

16:14.139 --> 16:16.740
If I were you,
I would be a nervous wreck.

16:16.807 --> 16:19.409
You know, I had a shot
at my dream job.

16:19.477 --> 16:20.877
Yeah?

16:20.945 --> 16:22.979
And I-I did really,
really well.

16:23.047 --> 16:24.848
And then it came time

16:24.915 --> 16:28.285
for me to meet the big boss,
and I choked.

16:28.353 --> 16:30.521
I went in, and-and
I complimented him,

16:30.588 --> 16:32.938
and then I realized,
"Oh, God, I'm kissing up."

16:32.939 --> 16:34.558
So I took back the compliment,

16:34.559 --> 16:37.827
and then it looked like
I was insulting him.

16:37.895 --> 16:41.014
So then I started telling jokes,
and they were really bad.

16:41.082 --> 16:43.751
And then... And-And then,
the next thing I knew,

16:43.818 --> 16:49.824
I was singing,
"Knick knack paddy whack" song.

16:49.891 --> 16:52.659
And I was just singing

16:52.727 --> 16:55.595
and singing at the top
of my lungs.

16:55.663 --> 17:00.033
And I just kept burying myself
deeper and deeper.

17:00.101 --> 17:02.987
And I lost my dream job.

17:05.189 --> 17:07.491
And when I walked out

17:07.559 --> 17:11.428
of that House of Pancakes,
I felt two inches tall.

17:17.569 --> 17:20.637
Well, Rebecca, that's about
the most depressing thing

17:20.704 --> 17:22.740
I've ever heard in my life.

17:22.807 --> 17:24.617
Hey, don't... Norm,
don't listen to me.

17:24.643 --> 17:25.910
It'll just bring you down.

17:25.977 --> 17:27.243
Yeah.
And you know what?

17:27.310 --> 17:30.113
I've been a jinx
my entire life,

17:30.181 --> 17:31.448
but that's me.

17:31.516 --> 17:33.450
That isn't you.

17:33.518 --> 17:35.185
You're gonna do great.

17:35.253 --> 17:36.453
Thanks.

17:36.521 --> 17:37.688
Good luck.

17:37.689 --> 17:39.056
Well, thanks a lot, Rebecca.

17:39.057 --> 17:40.290
And for what it's worth,

17:40.358 --> 17:42.392
I don't think you're
a jinx, all right?

17:42.460 --> 17:43.727
(quietly):
Thanks.

17:43.795 --> 17:45.729
(laughs)

18:01.912 --> 18:03.930
Ah, Norm.

18:03.998 --> 18:05.799
Mr. Hoffmeyer's
on his way.

18:05.800 --> 18:07.667
Uh, now remember,
this is just a formality.

18:07.668 --> 18:09.803
He's heard all kinds
of good things about you,

18:09.804 --> 18:12.306
and, well, I'm sure
that as soon as he meets you,

18:12.307 --> 18:14.641
uh, you'll be a permanent part
of this brewery.

18:14.642 --> 18:16.776
You seem a little nervous.
Are you, Norm?

18:16.844 --> 18:19.095
No. No.

18:19.163 --> 18:20.947
MIKE:
Oh, Mr. Hoffmeyer,

18:21.015 --> 18:23.133
I'd like you to meet
our star taster, Norm.

18:23.201 --> 18:24.367
Norm, Mr. Hoffmeyer.

18:24.435 --> 18:26.845
Norm, I hear you're doing
excellent work for us.

18:26.871 --> 18:28.338
Thank you very much, sir.

18:28.406 --> 18:29.807
(sighs)

18:29.874 --> 18:31.108
Nice pants.

18:31.175 --> 18:32.409
(chuckles)

18:33.778 --> 18:35.412
I can't believe
I just said that.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.380
Look, I'm not trying
to kiss up, sir.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.859
I take back what I said
about those pants, okay?

18:39.860 --> 18:41.384
Not that they're
not nice pants.

18:41.385 --> 18:42.786
I mean, of course they are.

18:42.787 --> 18:44.054
They're-They're-They're
great pants, you know.

18:44.055 --> 18:45.689
I just don't want you to think

18:45.690 --> 18:47.925
that all I'm doing is
looking at your pants.

18:47.926 --> 18:49.736
I'm also looking
at your face, sir,

18:49.761 --> 18:53.229
and-and your shirt, your
tie, all of which are lovely.

18:53.297 --> 18:55.982
Like a manly kind of lovely.
You know what I mean?

18:56.050 --> 18:58.985
Good Lord, I'm not making
much sense, am I, sir?

18:59.053 --> 19:00.820
Let me just start
all over again.

19:00.888 --> 19:02.756
Hello. My name
is Norm Pants.

19:02.823 --> 19:06.093
Ooh! Yay. That didn't come
out right, either, did it?

19:06.094 --> 19:08.629
(laughs): I'm gonna laugh
about that one tonight, sir.

19:08.630 --> 19:10.147
And I'm sure you will, too,

19:10.148 --> 19:12.082
when you take those
pants off tonight.

19:12.083 --> 19:13.383
Not that I'm thinking

19:13.384 --> 19:15.019
about you taking
your pants off, sir!

19:15.020 --> 19:16.586
Nothing could be
further from the truth!

19:16.587 --> 19:18.421
I mean, well, now,
don't get me wrong.

19:18.422 --> 19:20.691
You know, it's not like
I would be grossed out

19:20.692 --> 19:22.022
if you took your pants off.

19:22.027 --> 19:24.945
Go ahead, run around
naked for all I care!

19:25.012 --> 19:27.665
After all, you'll do
whatever you want to do.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.700
You're Mr. Hoffmeyer,
for crying out loud!

19:29.701 --> 19:31.969
Oh, come on, lighten
up, will you?!

19:32.037 --> 19:33.954
Why are you such a sourpuss?

19:34.021 --> 19:35.789
Come on. What's
it going to take

19:35.856 --> 19:37.891
to put a smile on
that face, huh?

19:37.959 --> 19:41.211
♪ With a knick knack paddy
whack, give a dog a bone ♪

19:41.279 --> 19:44.014
♪ This old man
came rolling home! ♪

19:46.323 --> 19:49.285
Sorry about the job
there, Norm.

19:49.286 --> 19:50.621
Oh, don't worry
about it, Cliff.

19:50.622 --> 19:51.955
What are you going to do?

19:52.023 --> 19:54.758
I had my dream job for
a week, and I lost it.

19:54.759 --> 19:56.710
But you've got to look on the...
on the bright side, you know.

19:56.711 --> 19:59.045
I mean, somebody could
walk up to me tomorrow,

19:59.046 --> 20:00.547
tap me on the shoulder, say,

20:00.548 --> 20:03.183
"Hey, we want you to sample
various types of pretzels."

20:03.184 --> 20:05.002
You know?

20:05.070 --> 20:06.803
Or-Or-Or pizza.

20:06.871 --> 20:07.971
Could happen.

20:08.039 --> 20:10.106
Maybe, big guy.

20:11.409 --> 20:13.526
Well, I did it.
I rigged the machine.

20:13.527 --> 20:15.528
The next person who pulls
that handle is going

20:15.529 --> 20:17.219
to be up to their
knees in nickels.

20:17.220 --> 20:18.765
All right, now,
don't you feel good?

20:18.766 --> 20:20.500
I mean, doesn't it
make you feel happy

20:20.501 --> 20:22.669
to know you did something
for a fellow human being?

20:22.670 --> 20:24.271
Isn't that what life's
really all about?

20:24.272 --> 20:26.523
You don't have my 20
bucks, do you, Sam?

20:26.524 --> 20:28.408
It's been kind of
a slow week, honey. I...

20:28.409 --> 20:31.011
Now, wai-wai-wait.

20:32.496 --> 20:33.964
REBECCA:
Norm.

20:34.032 --> 20:36.700
I just wanted to tell you

20:36.768 --> 20:38.768
how sorry I am
about this afternoon.

20:38.836 --> 20:41.972
Rebecca, for the hundredth
time, please relax.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.240
It wasn't your fault.

20:43.307 --> 20:44.441
I did it myself.

20:44.508 --> 20:45.708
I choked under pressure.

20:45.710 --> 20:48.011
Well, I felt so guilty
that I went out

20:48.079 --> 20:50.113
and got us this quart
of ice cream.

20:50.181 --> 20:51.347
Hmm.

20:51.415 --> 20:52.783
Mmm.

20:55.403 --> 20:57.371
(laughs)

20:57.439 --> 21:00.140
This is what
we losers do, Norm.

21:02.043 --> 21:04.494
We just drown our sorrows
in ice cream.

21:06.196 --> 21:07.263
But you know what?

21:07.331 --> 21:08.732
Huh?

21:08.800 --> 21:10.533
At least we're not alone.

21:10.602 --> 21:12.235
We have each other.

21:12.303 --> 21:14.588
You're not going to
kiss me again, are you?

21:14.656 --> 21:16.590
'Cause I still
have to drive home.

21:18.459 --> 21:20.561
Oh! Hey, look at that.

21:20.562 --> 21:22.229
These are nickels,
I guess, huh?

21:22.230 --> 21:25.232
Say, why don't you, uh, play
the slot machine one more time?

21:25.233 --> 21:26.333
Because I will lose.

21:26.334 --> 21:27.867
Where have you been all week?

21:27.868 --> 21:29.736
No. You know,
I feel good about this.

21:29.737 --> 21:31.738
Why-Why-Why don't you give it
one more shot?

21:31.739 --> 21:33.373
No.
Oh, come on!

21:33.374 --> 21:35.409
What's it gonna take
for you to understand

21:35.410 --> 21:36.576
that I will never win?

21:36.644 --> 21:38.445
All right,
fine, fine. Come on.

21:38.513 --> 21:40.280
Everybody step up while

21:40.348 --> 21:43.100
Lady Luck thumbs her nose
at Rebecca Howe.

21:47.955 --> 21:49.005
(bell rings)

21:52.677 --> 21:55.112
I got my nickel back.

21:55.113 --> 21:57.130
I thought that thing
was supposed to pay off.

21:57.131 --> 21:58.432
It's been paying off all week.

21:58.433 --> 21:59.566
I guess it's empty.

21:59.634 --> 22:00.784
Oh, I'm sorry.

22:00.852 --> 22:02.686
Sorry?

22:02.754 --> 22:05.755
This has never happened
to me before.

22:08.092 --> 22:10.594
I broke even.

22:10.661 --> 22:13.096
I've never broken even before.

22:13.164 --> 22:15.331
I'm not a loser.

22:15.399 --> 22:17.767
I'm a break-evener.

22:19.637 --> 22:20.837
Norm is a loser.

22:20.905 --> 22:23.172
See him eating his ice cream?

22:23.683 --> 22:26.076
You know what this means?

22:26.077 --> 22:28.078
It means
that my life isn't so terrible.

22:28.146 --> 22:30.147
It's... It's so-so!

22:30.215 --> 22:31.632
(Rebecca laughs)

22:31.699 --> 22:33.634
Isn't this great?!

22:34.736 --> 22:35.969
Hey, guys,

22:36.036 --> 22:38.806
did Rebecca call me a loser?

22:38.873 --> 22:40.808
I'm afraid so, Norm.

22:40.875 --> 22:43.176
Good. I thought she said,
"Leave me some."
