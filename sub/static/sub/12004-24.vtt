WEBVTT

00:00.192 --> 00:02.740
- Previously on "Switched at Birth"...
- Isn't it fantastic?

00:02.772 --> 00:05.132
- Four and a half stars.
- What?!

00:05.133 --> 00:07.119
I thought that when the book was done...

00:07.120 --> 00:09.873
- Things would go back to the way they were.
- Yeah.

00:09.886 --> 00:11.875
This isn't the end. It's the beginning.

00:11.881 --> 00:14.174
Scene four, take five. Marking.

00:14.175 --> 00:16.585
And action!

00:16.623 --> 00:19.153
Behind you.

00:19.154 --> 00:22.629
The law says that I have to accommodate
you to the best of my ability,

00:22.641 --> 00:27.104
so if you want to stay, go wash
dishes. Can't do much damage there.

00:27.978 --> 00:32.531
Yeah, I'd say sleeping
with my brother's girlfriend

00:32.533 --> 00:34.200
is not handling things right!

00:34.216 --> 00:37.307
I just have never understood the
obsession with marriage as an end game.

00:37.357 --> 00:40.219
- It's a piece of paper.
- I order Mr. Sorrento

00:40.220 --> 00:41.987
returned to Italy.

00:42.006 --> 00:44.564
I just thought that we had
some kind of future together.

00:44.577 --> 00:47.999
- I'm so sorry.
- Will you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?

00:48.221 --> 00:49.651
I... I will.

02:26.970 --> 02:29.065
- Hello.
- Hello.

02:30.679 --> 02:31.911
Yes, that's right.

02:31.949 --> 02:33.978
This is me branching out

02:33.989 --> 02:37.003
from grilling slabs of meat
and chili over an open flame.

02:37.011 --> 02:40.110
This is called shrimp etouf.

02:40.111 --> 02:42.110
EtouffÃ©e.

02:42.111 --> 02:44.462
Mm-mm!

02:44.468 --> 02:46.092
- So good!
- Thank you very much.

02:47.660 --> 02:48.980
Hey, dad, you know your record

02:48.981 --> 02:51.072
for most doubles in a single season?

02:51.073 --> 02:52.214
I certainly do.

02:52.239 --> 02:54.328
71 doubles, my young friend.

02:54.372 --> 02:57.907
- Why do you ask?
- Esteban Alvarado is creeping up on it.

02:58.495 --> 03:00.735
- Is that the catcher from the Indians?
- Really?

03:00.760 --> 03:03.021
- How many does he have?
- 68.

03:03.022 --> 03:04.984
68.

03:05.030 --> 03:06.810
But, I mean, you know,

03:06.823 --> 03:09.168
there's only like 14
games left in the season.

03:09.187 --> 03:11.933
Yeah, it's...

03:11.934 --> 03:13.942
Hey, have you guys seen my mom?

03:13.973 --> 03:16.720
I got a text from her
that said to come home.

03:16.751 --> 03:18.959
Uh, yeah, me too.

03:18.984 --> 03:21.950
What's going on?

03:33.402 --> 03:36.561
- What are you doing here?
- I thought the judge said he had to leave immediate...

03:36.562 --> 03:38.809
We got the necessary documentation

03:38.810 --> 03:40.818
for Angelo to stay in the country.

03:41.473 --> 03:44.834
Angelo can stay.

03:44.835 --> 03:47.184
- For how long?
- As long as you want.

03:47.197 --> 03:49.342
- How did you pull that off?
- You got a green card?

03:49.355 --> 03:52.471
We went back to the
judge who granted Angelo

03:52.509 --> 03:55.826
a stay of the removal order
when we told her that...

03:56.594 --> 03:58.934
we wanted to get married.

03:59.835 --> 04:01.889
You're getting married?!

04:03.832 --> 04:05.678
We already did.

04:05.991 --> 04:08.236
We had to do it immediately.

04:08.249 --> 04:10.659
This marriage is strictly on paper.

04:10.677 --> 04:13.118
Nothing is going to change.

04:13.687 --> 04:16.160
- Congratulations?
- Yeah.

04:29.306 --> 04:31.057
Were you drunk?

04:31.058 --> 04:33.597
At least then I could understand this.

04:33.598 --> 04:36.508
He was going to be kicked
out of the country for good.

04:36.533 --> 04:39.385
Bay was hysterical. I had to do something.

04:39.386 --> 04:41.663
I am so sorry I can't sign this

04:41.695 --> 04:43.428
and I wanted to tell you before,

04:43.548 --> 04:46.850
but I thought I should
tell everyone at once.

04:48.573 --> 04:51.564
- So what happens now?
- He finds an apartment.

04:51.565 --> 04:54.840
We have our immigration
interview and that's it.

04:54.897 --> 04:56.154
- That's it?
- Mm-hmm.

04:56.198 --> 05:00.847
- Now he's got you breaking the law for him.
- Ma!

05:00.897 --> 05:02.786
We are not robbing banks.

05:02.792 --> 05:05.947
My boss got his citizenship by
marrying a lesbian in Nashville.

05:05.959 --> 05:09.112
And if those two can get through
their interview, we'll be just fine.

05:09.232 --> 05:11.547
What kind of questions do they ask?

05:11.548 --> 05:14.614
I was going to ask him about that.

05:14.615 --> 05:18.548
Well, maybe I can find
some stuff about it online.

05:19.586 --> 05:21.543
Thank you,

05:21.544 --> 05:24.494
for handling this so well.

05:26.573 --> 05:28.659
Well, they're lying to the government

05:28.665 --> 05:31.531
and if we go along with it, so are we.

05:31.612 --> 05:33.619
You know, it's just... look,

05:33.620 --> 05:35.653
it's a done deal, Kathryn.
What do you want to do?

05:35.654 --> 05:37.181
You want to report them to immigration?

05:37.237 --> 05:39.771
And what are we telling the
kids? That's it okay to cheat?

05:39.891 --> 05:42.661
It's okay to pretend you're married?

05:42.662 --> 05:46.359
Uh, no, we're not saying...
look, I think what we do

05:46.360 --> 05:48.665
is we suck it up for Bay, because basically

05:48.666 --> 05:51.644
it's the same deal as if Angelo
had gotten his green card.

05:51.645 --> 05:53.835
What is that?

05:53.885 --> 05:55.943
Oh, it's just an alert I've got

05:55.944 --> 05:59.665
every time Alvarado comes up to bat.

05:59.666 --> 06:01.787
But it's not important.

06:01.825 --> 06:03.407
And what about Regina?

06:03.620 --> 06:05.591
First she's with Angelo,
then she's not with Angelo,

06:05.616 --> 06:07.680
then she's with Patrick,
now she's married to Angelo.

06:07.681 --> 06:09.612
I mean, you're okay with all that?

06:09.613 --> 06:12.635
- What do you want me to do?
- I don't know.

06:18.717 --> 06:20.925
- What did you say to Regina?
- Nothing.

06:20.926 --> 06:23.871
She just impulsively decided
to get married on her own?

06:23.872 --> 06:25.794
She says it wasn't that big of a deal.

06:25.813 --> 06:28.290
Tell that to the vein in mom's forehead.

06:28.503 --> 06:30.542
Did you hear J and K fighting last night?

06:30.555 --> 06:33.476
Okay look, I'm helping
Angelo find an apartment;

06:33.501 --> 06:36.291
We'll do our father-daughter bonding
over there. He won't be around.

06:36.554 --> 06:38.921
Mom's forehead's going
to go back to normal.

06:38.922 --> 06:40.885
I'll see you later.

06:41.541 --> 06:44.426
Hey, Kennish, get in on this.

06:44.488 --> 06:47.510
- What's that?
- Look who made it on the slutscore.

06:47.630 --> 06:50.131
Check out those comments.
Ha, they're brutal.

06:50.251 --> 06:53.913
- Payback really is a bitch.
- Real classy, guys.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.401
Come on, Kennish, it's a joke.

06:56.588 --> 06:59.917
You know, man, Simone just gives it
away and she's still got you whipped.

06:59.918 --> 07:02.825
- That's sad.
- Douche.

08:32.857 --> 08:33.964
Hey.

08:34.033 --> 08:37.791
So I realized I never said thank you.

08:37.792 --> 08:40.006
Oh, you don't have to thank me.

08:40.008 --> 08:41.770
I wasn't sure what you get your bio-mom

08:41.772 --> 08:44.394
for marrying your bio-dad so
that he doesn't get deported

08:44.413 --> 08:46.183
and it wasn't exactly like
you guys had a registry,

08:46.215 --> 08:48.821
but congratulations.

08:53.164 --> 08:54.747
It's gorgeous.

08:54.753 --> 08:56.811
It's obsidian. I found it in the Galapagos,

08:56.843 --> 09:01.029
but don't tell anyone that because it's
illegal to remove anything from the island.

09:01.379 --> 09:04.895
Which makes it the perfect
gift for a sham marriage.

09:06.792 --> 09:09.200
- But seriously, thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:09.387 --> 09:11.615
I'm going apartment hunting
with him this afternoon.

09:11.678 --> 09:14.456
- Good!
- Yeah, I looked up a few listings,

09:14.462 --> 09:17.433
you know that glass building
on Park, it's like a mile away?

09:17.458 --> 09:19.541
Rooftop deck, killer view.

09:19.547 --> 09:21.812
It might be a little pricey for Angelo...

09:21.856 --> 09:25.410
I mean, being in detention
and all the legal bills.

09:25.428 --> 09:28.075
Good point. I should have thought of that.

09:28.195 --> 09:31.404
I'll look for some more.

09:33.280 --> 09:36.790
And I'd better go so you can tell
your boyfriend about your husband.

09:37.935 --> 09:39.474
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:39.674 --> 09:42.077
Got your message. What's up?

09:45.797 --> 09:47.792
It isn't so bad.

09:47.793 --> 09:50.801
I'm not sure I need this much space.

09:51.218 --> 09:53.220
Maybe something a little bit more cozy.

09:53.876 --> 09:56.937
What is your budget exactly?

09:56.956 --> 09:58.805
Honey, it will be better
once I start working.

09:58.806 --> 10:01.204
Oh, I could help with that. I could, um...

10:04.797 --> 10:06.863
What is it that you do again?

10:06.864 --> 10:08.846
It's like music stuff, right?

10:08.847 --> 10:11.514
I did, but I was thinking of

10:11.634 --> 10:13.528
getting back into carpentry.

10:13.648 --> 10:16.494
Always been good at fixing things.

10:16.614 --> 10:18.784
That's cool.

10:22.750 --> 10:24.559
How did you expect me to react?

10:24.679 --> 10:27.424
You said it yourself... marriage
is just a piece of paper.

10:27.437 --> 10:30.352
Yeah, but between you and another
man who you have a kid with?

10:30.472 --> 10:32.110
You didn't think that would affect us?

10:32.147 --> 10:35.456
It doesn't mean anything.
It's just for legal reasons.

10:35.457 --> 10:37.434
Call me old-fashioned,
but I'm not sure how I feel

10:37.441 --> 10:39.800
about dating a woman who's
technically still on her honeymoon.

10:39.837 --> 10:41.787
Patrick, come o...

10:41.788 --> 10:43.758
Pat...

10:51.558 --> 10:54.010
Oh gross.

10:55.737 --> 10:58.747
- Do we have a lost and found?
- You know, in some cultures,

10:58.753 --> 11:00.636
finding a retainer is good luck.

11:00.667 --> 11:02.138
Five bucks if you try it on.

11:02.194 --> 11:03.677
10 if it fits.

11:04.697 --> 11:05.946
Ohh!

11:06.142 --> 11:07.312
Oh ahh.

11:09.577 --> 11:11.084
You cut yourself.

11:11.128 --> 11:13.487
Yeah, that was a wicked sharp knife.

11:13.982 --> 11:16.866
You know what? All right, c'mere, c'mere.

11:19.018 --> 11:21.415
If you take a band-aid
from the first aid kit,

11:21.427 --> 11:23.992
the entire kitchen's going
to know you messed up.

11:24.624 --> 11:27.146
Never let them see you bleed.

11:32.230 --> 11:34.791
- Perfecto.
- Thank you.

11:34.911 --> 11:38.401
You're welcome. Oh, you should
also keep a stash in your kit.

11:39.021 --> 11:42.130
Yeah, if I ever get off
dishwasher duty and I need a kit.

11:42.180 --> 11:44.326
I'm dying to get back to real food,

11:44.364 --> 11:47.335
not just the mashed-up remnants of it.

11:47.623 --> 11:51.421
Look, Daphne, you are not going
to be washing dishes forever.

11:51.896 --> 11:53.932
- Okay?
- Hey, can I ask you something?

11:54.052 --> 11:56.138
- Mm-hmm.
- I have this idea for the new menu

11:56.163 --> 11:57.684
that I thought I could pitch to chef...

11:57.696 --> 12:00.474
Oh, eagerness is good,

12:00.756 --> 12:02.588
but around here

12:02.607 --> 12:04.853
you don't get promoted
for the job you want.

12:04.973 --> 12:07.975
You get promoted for the job you do.

12:08.964 --> 12:11.916
Then I guess I'd better be the
best damn dishwasher in the world.

12:11.941 --> 12:15.172
Yeah.

12:29.426 --> 12:31.447
Oh my God.

12:31.465 --> 12:33.405
We should have gotten our stories straight.

12:33.442 --> 12:36.270
Relax, Gina, we don't
have to make up a story,

12:36.301 --> 12:39.391
because we lived it.
We just tell the truth.

12:40.055 --> 12:42.112
What if they ask how you proposed?

12:42.113 --> 12:44.415
Regina Vasquez?

12:44.484 --> 12:46.468
- Yeah.
- Come with me, please.

12:46.530 --> 12:49.130
- We'll be interviewing you first.
- Okay.

12:52.949 --> 12:55.105
Eureka Falls.

13:09.885 --> 13:12.632
Hey, I just wanted to thank you

13:12.663 --> 13:16.372
for defending me against
that stupid website.

13:16.974 --> 13:18.963
Those guys are douches. No big deal.

13:19.354 --> 13:21.215
It's a big deal to me.

13:21.866 --> 13:23.437
- Toby...
- Just don't.

13:23.474 --> 13:25.770
Look, I just... it seemed
like we were broken up.

13:25.783 --> 13:28.330
I didn't even think that
you would care at that point.

13:28.450 --> 13:30.507
And for all I knew, Emmett
and Bay were broken up.

13:30.513 --> 13:31.802
Stop talking.

13:31.858 --> 13:33.385
Can you at least tell me
how your music's going?

13:33.411 --> 13:35.782
- Have you been writing?
- We're not doing this.

13:42.461 --> 13:44.376
So, Mrs. Vasquez...

13:44.407 --> 13:45.921
- it is Vasquez?
- Mm-hmm.

13:46.041 --> 13:48.712
- So you're not taking your husband's last name?
- No, I'm not.

13:49.650 --> 13:52.754
- And why is that?
- Have you met my wife?

13:53.329 --> 13:56.214
- Which side of the bed does Regina sleep on?
- The left.

13:56.334 --> 13:59.324
- Which side of the bed does Angelo sleep on?
- The middle!

13:59.444 --> 14:01.782
But he'll tell you the right side.

14:01.783 --> 14:04.659
And if he says that I snore, he's lying.

14:04.847 --> 14:07.068
Let's move on to more personal items.

14:07.256 --> 14:09.083
What brand of shampoo does Angelo use?

14:09.352 --> 14:11.504
You don't expect a newlywed to know that.

14:11.554 --> 14:13.799
I think a hairstylist would.

14:13.800 --> 14:16.585
- Well...
- Tell me, how did you propose?

14:16.791 --> 14:20.764
I first proposed on our fifth date.

14:20.958 --> 14:23.554
We hiked to Eureka Falls.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.476
- Mm-hmm.
- And we were the only ones there.

14:26.488 --> 14:29.391
Because we forgot to
check the weather forecast

14:29.392 --> 14:31.000
and it started to pour.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.878
But then for a few minutes the rain stopped

14:33.922 --> 14:35.661
and the sun broke through the clouds.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.727
And that's when he promised me that

14:38.789 --> 14:40.541
one day he would marry me.

14:40.597 --> 14:43.251
I never thought it would take 17 years.

14:43.770 --> 14:46.735
I'm just glad I finally have the chance

14:46.741 --> 14:48.950
to get to know my two daughters.

15:08.748 --> 15:11.776
So this might be a little bit weird,

15:11.896 --> 15:14.817
and I will totally
understand if you say no,

15:14.937 --> 15:18.283
but we're trying to get "Dawn of the Deaf"

15:18.301 --> 15:19.903
into this horror convention

15:19.916 --> 15:23.037
and we have to cut together a trailer.

15:23.056 --> 15:26.909
I want to know if Emmett can come
over and work on the computer.

15:30.075 --> 15:32.583
You know what? It's a bad idea. I'm sorry.

15:32.596 --> 15:35.286
No... I mean, it's okay.

15:35.655 --> 15:37.912
He can come over.

15:37.913 --> 15:39.419
Thank you.

15:39.909 --> 15:42.131
Besides, I'm not gonna be home,

15:42.149 --> 15:45.709
so that'll just make
it easier for everybody.

15:48.024 --> 15:49.219
How are you doing with the whole

15:49.238 --> 15:53.054
mom-getting-married thing?

15:53.536 --> 15:56.157
Well, at least we didn't have to wear

15:56.169 --> 15:58.791
some awful bridesmaids dresses.

15:58.829 --> 16:03.095
True. Hey, and I finally
get to be legitimate!

16:03.215 --> 16:04.522
Bonus.

16:06.975 --> 16:08.557
Seriously, thank you

16:08.558 --> 16:11.411
for being okay with it.

16:13.819 --> 16:15.840
You're welcome.

16:20.639 --> 16:23.186
From what I've seen, you're a
couple with a deep shared history.

16:23.306 --> 16:26.076
So congratulations on
finally tying the knot.

16:26.433 --> 16:29.316
However I'm confused by
your living arrangements.

16:29.366 --> 16:31.694
You listed a Mission Hills
address as your residence.

16:31.750 --> 16:32.758
That's correct.

16:33.102 --> 16:35.085
Yet according to Mr.
Sorrento's credit record,

16:35.097 --> 16:37.600
just yesterday he applied
for a one-bedroom apartment

16:37.612 --> 16:39.583
on Warnall Road.

16:39.839 --> 16:42.469
Yes, and it's for my mother-in-law.

16:43.431 --> 16:45.659
You... you know how that is, right?

16:46.723 --> 16:48.131
I see.

16:48.324 --> 16:51.209
Unfortunately these kinds of red
flags, the address discrepancy

16:51.228 --> 16:52.936
and the timing of the marriage,

16:52.968 --> 16:54.325
require me to refer your case

16:54.326 --> 16:56.922
to our fraud investigation department.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.624
And what does that mean?

16:58.649 --> 16:59.555
It's fairly routine.

16:59.675 --> 17:02.528
Surprise inspections,
certain verifications.

17:02.584 --> 17:05.117
What do you need to verify?
We have a child together.

17:05.148 --> 17:08.089
That you actually live
together as husband and wife.

17:08.346 --> 17:10.661
- That won't be a problem for you, will it?
- No.

17:11.492 --> 17:13.307
Not at all.

17:32.060 --> 17:33.649
Seriously?

17:40.368 --> 17:41.657
Now what?

17:45.675 --> 17:48.853
So they can just show
up any time they want?

17:48.897 --> 17:50.968
And run periodic credit checks

17:50.987 --> 17:54.209
to make sure neither of us
tries to rent another apartment.

17:54.278 --> 17:56.630
I thought it was just going
to be the one interview.

17:56.675 --> 17:57.995
So did I.

17:58.013 --> 18:00.285
But this is getting way out of control.

18:00.304 --> 18:01.943
Then get the marriage annulled.

18:01.974 --> 18:06.667
We would be admitting fraud, and
I don't have $250,000 lying around.

18:07.324 --> 18:09.576
I don't know what to do.

18:13.518 --> 18:16.208
Take a deep breath.

18:18.797 --> 18:22.793
We've survived a lot worse than this.

18:25.649 --> 18:28.708
We're going to work this out. I promise.

18:31.079 --> 18:34.445
But we still have to tell the Kennishes.

18:41.890 --> 18:44.368
What do you think about that one?

18:44.488 --> 18:47.058
- That's too nice.
- What do you mean too nice?

18:47.077 --> 18:48.773
Sweetie, you're gonna be
signing hundreds of books.

18:48.774 --> 18:51.432
If you make every letter perfect,
your hand's gonna fall off.

18:51.444 --> 18:54.234
Trust me. Try doing it on a baseball.

18:54.628 --> 18:57.332
Dad, the guy from Sportscenter
is calling for you again.

18:57.338 --> 18:59.201
I'm still out of town.

18:59.321 --> 19:01.993
Sorry yeah, he's still outta town.

19:02.456 --> 19:03.726
What is that all about?

19:03.733 --> 19:05.891
They want me to come on some show

19:05.910 --> 19:08.544
when Alvarado breaks my
record and... you know. 

19:08.664 --> 19:09.826
Then don't do it.

19:09.827 --> 19:12.930
If I don't go, I'm just
some old bitter guy.

19:13.912 --> 19:16.026
Well, he hasn't broken it yet, right?

19:16.045 --> 19:18.479
Yeah right.

19:18.529 --> 19:20.150
Hey.

19:20.270 --> 19:21.389
Got a sec?

19:28.281 --> 19:30.602
You've been disappearing a lot lately.

19:31.378 --> 19:33.468
Is that a question?

19:34.094 --> 19:36.784
- Were you with Emmett?
- No.

19:38.624 --> 19:40.081
I wasn't.

19:41.076 --> 19:43.266
Good.

19:43.718 --> 19:46.769
So, uh, did you see
that thing about Simone?

19:46.807 --> 19:48.735
- The website?
- Yeah.

19:50.549 --> 19:51.888
Was it you?

19:53.139 --> 19:56.737
I wouldn't do that... as much as I want to.

20:01.336 --> 20:02.975
So, uh,

20:03.363 --> 20:05.641
you gonna tell me where you've been?

20:09.839 --> 20:12.535
What is going on in there?

20:12.560 --> 20:14.532
The bottom line is they're
going to be making sure

20:14.551 --> 20:16.540
that we are living
together and if we are not,

20:16.541 --> 20:20.400
- we could both go to jail.
- Uh, what?!

20:20.437 --> 20:22.796
- The interview didn't go well.
- I don't understand this.

20:22.815 --> 20:24.891
You knew this could happen,
yet you did it anyway.

20:24.910 --> 20:26.080
Dad, she didn't know that.

20:26.105 --> 20:28.733
She did know that. If this weren't
illegal, everybody would do it.

20:28.783 --> 20:30.466
Didn't you see that movie "Green Card"?

20:30.497 --> 20:32.468
There is no point in
arguing about this now.

20:32.487 --> 20:33.619
We'll just move out.

20:33.645 --> 20:35.420
What?! All of you?

20:35.421 --> 20:37.102
I thought the whole point
of you guys moving in

20:37.103 --> 20:38.812
was so that we could all
get to know each other.

20:38.837 --> 20:41.853
We still can, we'll just find
something close by that we can afford.

20:41.872 --> 20:44.749
- Wait, what's going on?
- Apparently you guys are moving out.

20:44.774 --> 20:47.608
- What? I don't want to move!
- All right, hold on a second.

20:47.627 --> 20:49.760
You and Angelo can find an apartment;

20:49.816 --> 20:51.612
Daphne and Adrianna, they stay here.

20:51.637 --> 20:53.827
- Yeah.
- I am not leaving Daphne!

20:53.947 --> 20:55.553
And I don't want to leave Bay either,

20:55.572 --> 20:57.261
but I am not going to turn
this house upside down again.

20:57.293 --> 20:59.200
Fine! Then Angelo will
move into the guest house.

20:59.213 --> 21:00.327
What are you talking about?

21:00.346 --> 21:03.167
Now Angelo is gonna move
into the guest house.

21:03.192 --> 21:05.239
Are there any more aunts and
uncles you want to move in too?

21:05.245 --> 21:07.059
I cannot do that to Daphne.

21:07.072 --> 21:08.753
Oh, now you're thinking about Daphne?

21:08.754 --> 21:10.532
All right, Daphne moves in
here. We have plenty of room.

21:10.551 --> 21:12.509
So now you are going to move in here.

21:12.528 --> 21:13.854
No, Daphne stays with me.

21:13.873 --> 21:16.563
- Never mind, that's not what's happening.
- Just stop, okay?

21:16.683 --> 21:18.791
I can't follow when
you're all talking at once!

21:18.803 --> 21:21.181
Which I think you would know by now.

21:21.212 --> 21:23.270
No, just stop! We're doing it.

21:23.277 --> 21:27.006
Angelo can move into the guest house
and everyone can stop fighting, okay?

21:27.037 --> 21:28.689
It's done!

21:54.476 --> 21:57.134
So I guess that Angelo's moving in,

21:57.172 --> 21:58.949
now you're gonna be moving out.

21:58.993 --> 22:00.657
No.

22:00.777 --> 22:03.184
You know none of this
would even be happening

22:03.203 --> 22:05.448
if you hadn't called the
authorities on my father

22:05.449 --> 22:08.220
behind everyone's back, including mine.

22:08.472 --> 22:10.666
Bay,

22:10.891 --> 22:13.719
- I'm sorry...
- It's too late to apologize.

22:13.725 --> 22:17.373
No no no, I wasn't going
to apologize for doing it.

22:17.392 --> 22:20.639
I was going to say that I'm sorry
you have such a jerk for a dad.

22:20.702 --> 22:23.023
And that one day you'll realize

22:23.035 --> 22:25.484
that I did the right thing.

22:25.485 --> 22:26.739
I don't get it.

22:26.859 --> 22:29.541
Regina changed. She turned
her whole life around.

22:29.542 --> 22:31.468
You were there for it.

22:32.501 --> 22:35.386
Why is it so hard to
believe that he can too?

22:40.174 --> 22:42.552
Because some people never change.

22:56.644 --> 22:58.127
You're back.

22:58.371 --> 23:02.150
Yeah, I just wanted to see if there
were any open shifts I could take.

23:02.181 --> 23:04.878
Sure! Take as many as you want.

23:05.135 --> 23:07.430
Trying to make some extra cash?

23:08.156 --> 23:10.890
Yeah, something like that.

23:26.726 --> 23:28.596
No, I'm just saying it would
have been nice if you had

23:28.627 --> 23:32.125
checked with me before you invited
him to move into our house with us.

23:32.175 --> 23:35.016
You're the one who told Regina about
marrying him in the first place.

23:35.041 --> 23:36.142
That wasn't my idea!

23:36.160 --> 23:38.681
I was repeating exactly what
the lawyer told me, okay?

23:38.682 --> 23:40.371
And by the way, whatever
happened to "John",

23:40.390 --> 23:42.267
it's wrong to help perpetuate a lie"?

23:42.285 --> 23:44.244
Because you know what? We
are going to be the ones lying

23:44.245 --> 23:47.509
every single time an immigration
agent shows up at our house.

23:47.565 --> 23:49.554
What was I supposed to
do? It was either that...

23:49.573 --> 23:52.375
or Daphne moves out, which
I am not about to let happen.

23:52.407 --> 23:54.435
- Oh, that's great.
- What?

23:54.441 --> 23:55.799
Alvarado's up to 70.

23:55.830 --> 23:57.575
Why don't you just turn
that damn alert off?

23:57.588 --> 24:00.660
I thought I had. Goodbye.
I'm going to work.

25:54.170 --> 25:55.809
Hey,

25:56.034 --> 25:58.355
I know things have been crazy around here

25:58.361 --> 26:00.532
and I was thinking we
should do something...

26:00.908 --> 26:02.434
just the three of us.

26:03.173 --> 26:04.681
We should go bowling.

26:05.488 --> 26:07.539
Obviously I can't bowl,

26:07.552 --> 26:09.879
but I could still put
away some cheesy fries.

26:10.142 --> 26:14.691
- I have to work tonight.
- You've been working a lot lately.

26:15.648 --> 26:18.745
- Bye, grandma.
- Goodbye, corazon.

26:26.074 --> 26:29.228
- You can't blame her.
- I know.

26:29.348 --> 26:30.867
This is a disaster.

26:30.886 --> 26:33.143
My daughter doesn't want to be home.

26:34.734 --> 26:37.605
I just wanted to do what
was best for everyone.

26:37.636 --> 26:39.595
Are you sure about that?

26:39.946 --> 26:41.185
What is that supposed to mean?

26:43.431 --> 26:47.147
- I married him so my daughter
could get to know her father.
- Yeah, maybe.

26:47.397 --> 26:49.743
But isn't this what
you've wanted all along?

26:49.775 --> 26:51.921
- How could you say that?
- Regina,

26:51.989 --> 26:54.985
how many times have you said
that you're done with him?

26:55.105 --> 26:56.912
He's an addiction

26:57.032 --> 26:58.995
and now you'll be living with him.

27:18.112 --> 27:20.289
Get off me!

27:20.409 --> 27:22.529
Don't touch me!

27:26.571 --> 27:28.260
What just happened?!

27:28.261 --> 27:31.739
Hey, Toby! Oh my God, are you okay?

27:33.634 --> 27:35.599
Did he hit you?

28:01.807 --> 28:04.102
Can you put those over there?
I'm running out of room.

28:04.103 --> 28:06.115
Hello? Hello!

28:06.116 --> 28:08.120
Oh.

28:45.052 --> 28:47.186
I'll pay for it.

28:47.187 --> 28:49.170
They're 49Â¢ plates.

28:51.166 --> 28:53.169
Are you okay?

28:53.824 --> 28:56.959
I'm fine. I'm really sorry, chef.

28:57.015 --> 29:00.174
Okay, you are not fine
and you can call me Jeff.

29:01.144 --> 29:03.065
When you're having a
breakdown in my storage room,

29:03.090 --> 29:05.255
you're allowed to call me Jeff.

29:07.244 --> 29:09.221
Now do you want to tell me what's going on?

29:11.267 --> 29:13.488
It's a really long story.

29:15.477 --> 29:16.860
Do you want to go home?

29:17.492 --> 29:20.427
No, that's the last place
I want to be right now.

29:24.937 --> 29:26.552
I should get back to work.

29:28.335 --> 29:29.141
Okay.

29:31.275 --> 29:34.078
But you can slow down a little
bit. It's not an olympic sport.

29:39.665 --> 29:42.381
And if it's crazy at home,

29:42.712 --> 29:45.008
maybe that's where you should
be breaking some plates.

30:06.713 --> 30:09.241
Uh, don't worry. I will use
my headphones when I play.

30:09.867 --> 30:12.613
But if Toby wants to jam,
I'm sorry, all bets are off.

30:13.058 --> 30:14.979
I'm glad this is a joke to you.

30:15.335 --> 30:16.555
I'm sorry.

30:17.024 --> 30:18.827
I don't think this is a joke.

30:19.127 --> 30:20.466
Really.

30:22.219 --> 30:25.785
I tried to fix one problem
and I created 100 others.

30:26.855 --> 30:29.133
Things will calm down.

30:29.914 --> 30:31.503
We have to give it time.

30:33.474 --> 30:34.731
Come here.

30:43.572 --> 30:45.680
I have to go.

31:12.443 --> 31:13.544
Thank you.

31:16.497 --> 31:18.667
Oh, it's nothing.

31:21.220 --> 31:22.922
There's a player, he's

31:22.940 --> 31:26.038
about to tie my record for doubles.

31:35.731 --> 31:37.646
"Maybe he'll get a broken leg"?

31:37.665 --> 31:40.117
That would be nice, but I...

31:40.174 --> 31:41.826
Ah!

31:44.635 --> 31:46.712
"Maybe not." Yeah.

31:46.832 --> 31:49.314
I can't watch.

31:51.395 --> 31:54.692
I tied somebody else's record? Yes, I did.

31:54.711 --> 31:56.951
Do you remember that guy's name?

31:58.477 --> 32:01.130
No, nor does anyone else.

32:02.394 --> 32:03.820
Later.

32:16.780 --> 32:20.176
What the hell are you doing?

32:21.754 --> 32:23.888
This you?

32:24.826 --> 32:26.503
Killer.

32:27.041 --> 32:30.613
It was... until you ruined it.

32:31.557 --> 32:33.704
Put the pin back in
the grenade, angry girl.

32:33.729 --> 32:36.676
- I'm just answering your piece.
- You didn't answer it!

32:36.682 --> 32:39.091
You finished it.

32:39.110 --> 32:41.675
Yeah well, hey, that's how
it works on the streets...

32:41.700 --> 32:44.434
someone does a piece of art
and someone else finishes it.

32:44.447 --> 32:47.500
I know how it works. I'm a
street artist too... obviously.

32:47.569 --> 32:49.113
You are missing the point.

32:49.119 --> 32:51.228
The point is I wanted to
be the one to finish it.

32:51.247 --> 32:53.035
And I kept getting
interrupted by all these people

32:53.073 --> 32:55.093
doing things that I
didn't even ask them to do!

32:55.094 --> 32:57.146
All right, you know
what? Here, stop talking.

32:57.165 --> 32:58.441
You finish it.

32:58.629 --> 33:00.600
You don't have to yell.

33:05.918 --> 33:07.420
You're Medusa.

33:07.540 --> 33:09.040
You did that alley over on 30th

33:09.072 --> 33:11.124
the one with the sea creatures
coming out of the sewer

33:11.143 --> 33:13.602
and that other one over
on Bales with the snakes

33:13.614 --> 33:16.135
who were fleeing the burnt-out pet store.

33:17.042 --> 33:18.656
What was the idea behind that one?

33:18.719 --> 33:22.298
Like the snakes set the place on
fire before hauling ass to freedom?

33:22.323 --> 33:24.869
I don't know, dude. Yeah sure, whatever.

33:24.870 --> 33:28.556
- You're very perceptive.
- Well, I really like your stuff.

33:28.775 --> 33:29.977
Thanks.

33:30.202 --> 33:32.273
But seriously,

33:32.542 --> 33:33.850
if you really hate the way it looks,

33:33.837 --> 33:35.445
go ahead and finish her the way you want.

33:36.452 --> 33:39.730
- I don't need to finish it.
- You're sure?

33:39.917 --> 33:41.162
I'm sure.

33:49.148 --> 33:51.087
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

33:51.143 --> 33:53.751
This is the regular meeting
of the Leawood sobriety group

33:53.752 --> 33:55.491
of alcoholics anonymous.

33:55.611 --> 33:57.168
My name is Steve.

33:57.174 --> 33:59.008
I'm an alcoholic and your secretary.

33:59.128 --> 34:01.148
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:07.132 --> 34:10.181
God grant me the serenity to
accept the things I cannot change,

34:10.181 --> 34:13.106
the courage to change the things I can...

34:21.907 --> 34:23.440
Can I talk to you?

34:24.466 --> 34:26.212
Yeah, of course.

34:30.429 --> 34:34.539
I've tried really hard to be
okay with Angelo moving in,

34:34.833 --> 34:36.157
but I'm not.

34:36.692 --> 34:39.395
I thought you guys were getting along.

34:39.514 --> 34:42.992
We are. It's just too much too soon.

34:44.668 --> 34:45.732
I know.

34:46.851 --> 34:48.516
I...

34:48.636 --> 34:50.857
I wanted him back,

34:50.869 --> 34:52.920
but not like this.

34:53.103 --> 34:54.860
It's like if he and I

34:54.880 --> 34:56.474
don't have the greatest

34:56.475 --> 34:58.783
father-daughter relationship in the world,

34:58.821 --> 35:01.235
then all of this is for nothing.

35:01.949 --> 35:04.319
I get how important this is to you.

35:04.338 --> 35:06.539
I just don't want to have to wake up

35:06.540 --> 35:08.592
and make small talk over breakfast

35:08.617 --> 35:11.658
or come home and have
him ask me how my day was.

35:13.989 --> 35:16.104
I wish that there was a better way.

35:23.567 --> 35:25.979
It's clear that this is not going to work

35:26.099 --> 35:28.522
and I need to accept
responsibility for that.

35:28.829 --> 35:30.731
I'm just going to tell
the judge that I panicked

35:30.737 --> 35:32.221
and made a mistake.

35:32.341 --> 35:34.611
I'm not sure the "oops, sorry" defense

35:34.636 --> 35:36.469
stands up to fraud charges.

35:36.589 --> 35:38.446
The judge was reasonable.

35:38.978 --> 35:40.805
I'll just tell her that
the pressure was too much

35:40.786 --> 35:42.106
and I made a rash decision.

35:42.127 --> 35:45.503
Yeah, but before you do anything like
that, you'd better contact a lawyer,

35:45.553 --> 35:49.483
- because I...
- You don't have to do that.

35:50.528 --> 35:54.513
What if Angelo doesn't
move into the guest house

35:54.782 --> 35:57.353
but he moves in here?

35:58.086 --> 35:59.106
With us?

36:00.426 --> 36:02.872
And that way nobody has to go to prison,

36:03.106 --> 36:05.344
Bay can get to know her dad

36:05.394 --> 36:07.684
and I can have some distance.

36:08.610 --> 36:10.024
Everybody's happy.

36:14.416 --> 36:18.026
Or as happy as we could be...

36:38.069 --> 36:40.966
Everyone has been looking for you.

36:42.248 --> 36:45.363
Are you okay? Let me take a look at that.

36:45.720 --> 36:47.452
He's all moved in.

36:47.453 --> 36:50.538
Oh God. Oh no.

36:59.310 --> 37:02.444
I'm sorry I didn't come to you sooner.

37:02.957 --> 37:05.823
No, I should have said something.

37:06.987 --> 37:08.082
But you couldn't.

37:12.067 --> 37:14.451
Is it because I haven't been able to sign?

37:14.983 --> 37:16.629
I feel awful about that.

37:16.654 --> 37:18.900
And I'm going to start
trying with this hand again.

37:18.907 --> 37:19.652
Mom, no.

37:19.933 --> 37:21.941
You're supposed to let them rest.

37:22.192 --> 37:24.065
I can read your lips.

37:26.253 --> 37:27.592
But it's not the same.

37:32.684 --> 37:34.967
No, it's not.

37:36.331 --> 37:38.527
But we'll manage.

37:41.043 --> 37:42.013
Mom,

37:42.619 --> 37:45.410
I'm okay, really, with all of it.

37:49.451 --> 37:51.290
There you go again.

37:51.516 --> 37:53.674
This time I mean it.

37:53.987 --> 37:54.738
I swear.

37:54.775 --> 37:58.604
And besides it's not just about
me any more... there's Bay.

37:58.861 --> 38:02.196
And I know what it's like to
want to get to know your real dad.

38:02.316 --> 38:06.018
How can I stand in the way
of Bay getting to know hers?

38:11.355 --> 38:13.113
Come here.

38:22.115 --> 38:24.048
Would you pour me one of those?

38:25.443 --> 38:27.933
- This is for you.
- Ahh.

38:28.577 --> 38:31.180
I'm sorry about your record, honey.

38:31.236 --> 38:33.645
Not mine any more.

38:33.926 --> 38:37.513
Here's to Esteban Alvarado.

38:37.633 --> 38:39.650
Aww, honey.

38:40.783 --> 38:42.810
Oh.

38:43.592 --> 38:46.226
I just liked being that guy.

38:46.746 --> 38:48.510
I know.

38:49.968 --> 38:52.063
I don't like sharing.

38:53.227 --> 38:56.424
You'll always be Bay and Daphne's father,

38:56.544 --> 39:00.629
and to me you'll always be that guy.

39:01.648 --> 39:04.438
I better call the guy from Sportscenter,

39:04.488 --> 39:06.490
tell him I'll do his damn show,

39:06.715 --> 39:09.236
pretend to be happy about it.

39:09.912 --> 39:13.646
I'm getting a lot of
practice at that these days.

39:29.634 --> 39:31.774
So what happened with Emmett?

39:32.331 --> 39:33.482
What was he doing here?

39:33.507 --> 39:36.980
He was editing that zombie
movie for some film festival.

39:37.168 --> 39:39.488
Daphne asked if it was all
right for him to come over.

39:39.526 --> 39:40.627
She didn't ask me.

39:40.747 --> 39:44.318
I guess she just figured
you'd be okay with it.

39:44.975 --> 39:46.133
Well, I'm not.

39:48.098 --> 39:49.167
I'm sorry.

39:49.480 --> 39:51.682
You do act like you're okay, though,

39:51.683 --> 39:54.079
with everything.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.775
Well, I don't run around
crying and yelling,

39:56.781 --> 40:01.004
but I'm not thrilled that my
girlfriend had sex with your boyfriend.

40:02.787 --> 40:04.335
Oh, that sounds really gross

40:04.366 --> 40:05.617
when you just lay it out like that.

40:05.636 --> 40:06.900
Yeah, it's not pleasant.

40:07.901 --> 40:09.090
I just...

40:09.121 --> 40:12.631
don't like being near the
center of all this drama.

40:13.269 --> 40:14.770
I know what you mean.

40:14.783 --> 40:15.634
Come on.

40:15.847 --> 40:17.605
You love being the center of the drama.

40:17.661 --> 40:20.320
No, I just have a lot
more practice than you do.

40:21.371 --> 40:23.036
True that.

40:27.122 --> 40:28.805
So how do you feel about

40:29.087 --> 40:30.507
Angelo moving in?

40:31.083 --> 40:33.235
I mean, you live here too.

40:33.355 --> 40:34.287
I don't know.

40:34.462 --> 40:37.734
I guess it's just gonna get
a little bit more crowded.

40:40.309 --> 40:41.779
You wanna get out of here?

40:42.392 --> 40:44.031
Where?

40:51.947 --> 40:53.498
You did this?

40:54.068 --> 40:54.975
Some of it..

40:55.095 --> 40:56.320
The girl's mine

40:56.727 --> 40:58.203
Mm, I can tell.

40:58.792 --> 41:00.037
What about the rest?

41:00.224 --> 41:01.801
Somebody else did that.

41:02.063 --> 41:03.446
Who is he?

41:05.354 --> 41:06.531
Nobody.

41:09.954 --> 41:11.824
It's a step up from setting my dolls

41:11.837 --> 41:13.877
on fire with mom's kitchen torch, right?

41:13.907 --> 41:15.265
Pfft, yeah, that wasn't creepy at all.

41:15.290 --> 41:16.660
I was experimenting.

41:16.685 --> 41:18.444
I was sleeping with my door locked.

41:18.450 --> 41:20.102
It was not that dangerous!

41:20.127 --> 41:23.330
Come on, you almost
burned your playhouse down.

41:23.593 --> 41:24.982
Fire trucks came.

41:30.834 --> 41:32.336
That's pretty awesome.

41:49.397 --> 41:51.299
Hey, come check this out!

42:01.025 --> 42:02.809
You must be angry girl.

42:02.929 --> 42:04.984
Don't make me regret bringing you.
