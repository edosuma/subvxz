WEBVTT

00:07.441 --> 00:10.242
You certainly know how to take
advantage of a day out.

00:10.244 --> 00:12.044
Just passin' the time.

00:12.079 --> 00:14.579
"Passing time."
Is that what we're calling it?

00:14.582 --> 00:16.782
- OK, knock it off now.
- Sorry to make you wait.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.824
It took us longer to wrap
things up than we thought.

00:18.885 --> 00:21.053
- Thanks for doing this, Flo.
- Well...

00:21.121 --> 00:23.388
I like the morgue,
but this is a nice change.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.858
Did you get a picture
of the suspect?

00:25.926 --> 00:28.627
I did. And I had that fellow
print a photo, just like

00:28.695 --> 00:30.796
you asked. I think I could've
done better with the framing.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.831
This is who has been sneaking

00:32.900 --> 00:34.900
in to breed with Mrs. Timmons'
Great Dane?

00:34.902 --> 00:37.536
Don't underestimate him.
He's small but determined.

00:37.538 --> 00:40.105
I don't know, I think
the composition is challenging.

00:40.107 --> 00:42.074
Really? Thank you.

00:42.142 --> 00:44.209
You know, I do some of the shots
down at the morgue.

00:44.245 --> 00:47.412
It's a real art to put together
a shot that's the...

00:47.415 --> 00:49.415
There is someone
in that house with a gun.

00:49.450 --> 00:51.316
- A gun?
- They have a stocking

00:51.384 --> 00:54.419
over their head. You take the
back, I'm gonna go to the front.

00:54.422 --> 00:56.889
- Do I get a gun?
- No!

01:11.138 --> 01:13.038
Look, whatever
you want, we'll pay it!

01:34.494 --> 01:36.428
Sh.

02:01.922 --> 02:04.956
Come on!

02:16.871 --> 02:18.837
Come on!

02:18.873 --> 02:20.772
Go, go, go!

02:33.587 --> 02:35.587
Flo, what the hell
were you thinking?

02:35.589 --> 02:37.433
I suspect an adrenaline rush
overcame better judgment,

02:37.457 --> 02:40.659
so I wasn't thinking. - Never do that again.
- Trust me, it's not a problem.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.339
Just what were
private detectives doing

02:54.408 --> 02:56.174
in this neighbourhood?
Were you spying on me?

02:56.243 --> 02:58.544
Well, that is quite
an accusation, Mr. Conroyd.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.946
Well, as you witnessed, I have
good reason to be cautious.

03:00.948 --> 03:03.348
It was an unrelated case
which is now resolved.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.617
Yeah, fortunate for us.
Thank you

03:05.619 --> 03:08.487
for saving our family.
It was a group effort.

03:08.522 --> 03:11.490
Prohibition makes little sense
at the best of times

03:11.525 --> 03:14.593
and right now, it makes none.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.695
Single malt, directly from
Scotland. Do you care for some?

03:16.697 --> 03:19.231
How can I say no?

03:26.307 --> 03:28.773
I'll get right to the point.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.875
I want to hire you to find
the bastards who did this.

03:30.878 --> 03:33.779
All right. Well, let's
start with the obvious.

03:33.847 --> 03:36.047
Who would want to harm you
or your family?

03:36.050 --> 03:39.050
I can do better than that.
I know precisely who they are.

03:39.053 --> 03:42.020
- You do?
- Communists. Anarchists.

03:42.056 --> 03:44.256
Union agitators.
Why would communists

03:44.324 --> 03:46.258
want to hurt your family?
At worst,

03:46.326 --> 03:48.927
to make an example of capitalist
swine by killing us.

03:48.929 --> 03:51.230
- And at the least?
- To intimidate me.

03:51.265 --> 03:53.732
We've been having problems with
them at my factory for months.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.334
Well, that is quite
a leap from labour unrest

03:56.403 --> 03:57.335
to attempted murder.

03:57.338 --> 03:58.348
Yeah, but it's been growing

03:58.372 --> 04:00.505
progressively worse. We even

04:00.573 --> 04:02.507
called in the Pinkertons,
but their speciality

04:02.509 --> 04:04.476
is administering beatings,

04:04.478 --> 04:07.078
not weeding out extremists.
They got nowhere.

04:07.081 --> 04:09.347
Right. Is this the rope
that you were bound with?

04:09.350 --> 04:11.983
Yeah. It cut into my wrists.

04:12.052 --> 04:14.819
Looks like hair. Maybe hog.

04:14.822 --> 04:17.454
I wouldn't know.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.457
One last question.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.660
Besides our stellar abilities,

04:21.661 --> 04:24.763
why do you think we'll have more
success than other agencies?

04:24.765 --> 04:27.399
Well, I think your team could

04:27.467 --> 04:30.269
move amongst our employees in a
way that other detectives can't.

04:41.348 --> 04:43.715
<i>Communists?</i>

04:43.717 --> 04:46.351
I thought the police cracked
down on them back in 1919.

04:46.419 --> 04:49.454
There was some excuse
to round them up.

04:49.456 --> 04:52.324
Association with
unlawful organizations

04:52.326 --> 04:54.593
advocating force to change
the government of Canada.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.528
Or something like that.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.530
I guess it forced them
to go underground.

04:58.532 --> 05:00.866
Yeah. I mean, who can blame
them? A lot of these workers

05:00.934 --> 05:02.834
came back from the war
only to end up

05:02.902 --> 05:05.804
earning peanuts in factories
owned by war profiteers.

05:05.872 --> 05:08.707
Yeah, if you made it back.
And what if you're one

05:08.775 --> 05:10.687
of those women went to work
to support the effort?

05:10.711 --> 05:12.591
Then you made half the amount
that the men did

05:12.645 --> 05:14.813
or you lost your job.
Try being black.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.049
- Spoken like a true Bolshevik.
- I decided to keep

05:17.117 --> 05:19.685
- my politics to myself.
- What?

05:19.753 --> 05:22.487
An opinionated black woman
isn't always appreciated?

05:22.489 --> 05:25.557
- Not always.
- Well, regardless,

05:25.592 --> 05:28.026
a political stance is no excuse
for attempted murder.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.061
- So what's our first step?
- Well...

05:30.064 --> 05:32.731
let's find out why Mr. Conroyd

05:32.733 --> 05:34.900
believes we are the ones
best suited for this case.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.679
What Mr. Conroyd
was referring to

05:47.747 --> 05:49.714
is that Conroyd Industries

05:49.717 --> 05:52.784
employs a very large number of
female employees. Most of them

05:52.852 --> 05:54.786
came to us during the war,
and then when their husbands

05:54.788 --> 05:58.289
didn't return... It wasn't women
behind the attacks, Mr. Scanlon.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.025
There are men working here
too, in shipping and receiving.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.862
Not a lot, but a few.
And you think

06:03.930 --> 06:05.864
that there are communists
amongst your employees?

06:05.866 --> 06:09.200
Absolutely. We can't
just bust heads

06:09.203 --> 06:11.548
and get rid of them. The general
strikes in Winnipeg and Boston

06:11.572 --> 06:13.571
taught us that.
So what will you do?

06:13.640 --> 06:16.207
- Negotiate?
- Ha ha ha! Lord, no.

06:16.210 --> 06:18.076
We just need to be more clever

06:18.078 --> 06:20.111
in eradicating them.

06:20.114 --> 06:22.547
Conroyd Industries is a very
forwardthinking company.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.382
Well, if they are responsible...

06:24.385 --> 06:26.251
- They are.
- If they are responsible,

06:26.319 --> 06:28.353
then we will get
to the bottom of things.

06:28.389 --> 06:30.255
I'm counting on it.

06:30.257 --> 06:32.657
Well, call me
if you need anything.

06:32.659 --> 06:34.459
Of course.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.167
You must be the new girl.

06:42.169 --> 06:45.604
Clara Pavey!

07:01.522 --> 07:03.522
Hello there.

07:05.392 --> 07:07.192
You gave me
a terrible start, Detective.

07:07.194 --> 07:09.594
- I'm sorry, Miss Higgins.
- Fern.

07:09.596 --> 07:12.597
I was wondering if we could talk
about what happened this morning.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.477
There's not much to tell.
I was working at the table

07:14.501 --> 07:17.335
and the next thing I knew, there
was a man standing in the doorway.

07:17.337 --> 07:19.438
Which doorway?

07:19.506 --> 07:21.372
- The inside one.
- Not from the backyard?

07:21.375 --> 07:24.142
No...

07:24.211 --> 07:26.978
Did you get a look at him?
Even just the slightest glimpse

07:26.980 --> 07:29.481
- under his mask.
- Wish I had.

07:29.516 --> 07:31.483
What about any... any markings,

07:31.551 --> 07:34.285
tattoos or scars?
Nothing like that.

07:34.288 --> 07:37.689
Did he say anything? Maybe he had an
accent, or used a specific turn of phrase?

07:37.724 --> 07:40.225
Nothing, but it was
clear what he wanted.

07:40.227 --> 07:43.895
It all happened so fast, I... I
didn't even have time to scream.

07:43.897 --> 07:47.466
Thank you.

07:50.036 --> 07:53.571
I was just reading the <i> Daily</i> and the
next thing I knew, a man was there.

07:53.574 --> 07:56.708
He hit me, and... I don't really
know what happened after that.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.643
Does your father
have any enemies?

07:58.645 --> 08:02.714
- I thought Communists were responsible.
- I like to keep an open mind.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.850
So what you

08:04.918 --> 08:06.885
really want are the skeletons
in the family closet.

08:06.887 --> 08:08.820
Just the ones
that come back to haunt.

08:11.391 --> 08:13.391
Well, my father has a mistress.

08:13.393 --> 08:15.660
Probably one in a long line.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.996
I'm sure he has a number
of business enemies.

08:18.064 --> 08:20.999
My mother's good
for half a bottle a day.

08:21.001 --> 08:24.168
She'll soon be off
to her annual "dry out."

08:24.171 --> 08:26.671
It's nothing unusual
for the Rosedale set.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.541
Well, I appreciate your candour.

08:29.543 --> 08:32.876
If you think of anything else,

08:32.880 --> 08:35.113
please get in touch.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.621
It must have gone very well
with Mr. Scanlon.

08:43.690 --> 08:47.659
I don't remember him ever
hiring a gal as quickly as you.

08:47.727 --> 08:49.628
Well, I just told him
I needed a job

08:49.696 --> 08:51.863
and he seemed to appreciate it.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.901
It's nice to have
someone new to chat with.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.936
I'm Zelda.

08:57.938 --> 09:00.371
People call me a talkietooter

09:00.374 --> 09:02.173
but I always get my work done.

09:02.242 --> 09:04.042
I saw you when you came in.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.711
Gosh, you dress nice.

09:06.713 --> 09:09.447
I like to try to be
real up on things too.

09:09.516 --> 09:11.983
And your shoes

09:11.985 --> 09:14.319
- are so pretty.
- Thanks.

09:14.321 --> 09:18.223
Hey, do you know anything
about this terrible rumour

09:18.291 --> 09:20.258
that someone tried to kill
Mr. Conroyd and his family?

09:20.260 --> 09:23.128
- Isn't it awful?
- I heard it was Communists.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.730
You heard that too?

09:25.798 --> 09:27.532
Word is they may even

09:27.568 --> 09:29.434
be working right here
at the plant.

09:29.436 --> 09:31.402
Go on! Not here!

09:31.405 --> 09:33.738
I don't think they are,

09:33.740 --> 09:35.840
but this whole business
has gotten me to wondering.

09:35.842 --> 09:38.944
Have you ever met a Communist?

09:39.012 --> 09:41.713
Never! But I have
my eyes and ears open

09:41.781 --> 09:44.248
you can be sure of that.
That's good to hear.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.618
Me too.

09:48.121 --> 09:51.122
Nice meeting you.
Nice to meet you too.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.925
All right!
That's it! It's break time!

09:56.029 --> 09:59.197
- Can I come in?
- Of course.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.433
- I just want to apologize.
- For what?

10:01.501 --> 10:03.534
For getting in the way
back at the Conroyd house.

10:03.537 --> 10:06.104
Flo, you don't
need to apologize.

10:06.106 --> 10:09.040
Still, I want to make it up to
you so I did some asking around

10:09.042 --> 10:11.876
about your case. I hope you don't mind.
Not at all.

10:11.878 --> 10:14.312
You see, I made a friend while
I was working on your dog case.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.181
That man that I
saw you speaking with?

10:16.216 --> 10:18.616
He works
at Mrs. Timmons' household.

10:18.619 --> 10:21.586
My first friend since Herb
didn't make it back.

10:21.622 --> 10:23.788
Good for you.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.224
Anyway, he knows
all the dirt in Rosedale,

10:26.226 --> 10:28.126
so he told me
about the Conroyds:

10:28.128 --> 10:31.462
The husband's affairs, the wife's drinking
problem. And the son's a layabout.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.932
Flo, I knew this already,
but I don't think it's relevant.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.967
But thank you.

10:36.003 --> 10:37.935
He also told me

10:38.004 --> 10:39.804
about a vehicle
that was parked in the alley

10:39.806 --> 10:41.639
a couple of times
over the last few weeks.

10:41.708 --> 10:44.342
They were casing the place,
planning the attack.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.477
But you know
what bothers me, Flo?

10:46.480 --> 10:49.614
The getaway vehicle
was parked in the alleyway.

10:49.650 --> 10:52.283
- So?
- So there was a clear path

10:52.351 --> 10:54.329
from the alleyway to
the kitchen, yet the attackers

10:54.353 --> 10:56.421
used an entirely different path

10:56.423 --> 10:59.490
that left them exposed.
That doesn't make sense.

10:59.493 --> 11:02.160
No, it doesn't.

11:04.931 --> 11:06.831
Drake Private Detectives.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.167
Speaking.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.504
Well, who is this?

11:25.852 --> 11:27.785
You gotta go.

11:38.631 --> 11:40.765
Hey, buddy.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.734
What are you doing here?

12:01.955 --> 12:05.223
What the heck happened?

12:05.225 --> 12:07.225
You know, I've never been

12:07.293 --> 12:09.961
in an actual explosion before.

12:09.963 --> 12:12.363
It's like this...
concussion wave

12:12.431 --> 12:15.500
that just... takes the breath
right out of you.

12:15.502 --> 12:18.436
Thank God you weren't killed.

12:18.438 --> 12:21.740
Well, I think that was
the point. I was lured there.

12:21.775 --> 12:24.342
What are the cops thinking?

12:24.344 --> 12:26.744
Industrial sabotage
by disgruntled employees.

12:26.747 --> 12:29.313
Not the attempt
to kill the private detective

12:29.316 --> 12:33.017
hired by the owner? What about you?
What did you make out?

12:33.019 --> 12:35.453
The plant gossip
introduced herself.

12:35.455 --> 12:39.023
Zelda. I brought up communists
and she flinched.

12:39.025 --> 12:41.292
- You think she's red?
- You know, I got the impression

12:41.361 --> 12:44.796
that everyone down there just
wants better working conditions.

12:44.798 --> 12:47.132
That doesn't
make them a communist.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.334
- She found you. That's convenient.
- My thoughts exactly.

12:50.337 --> 12:52.436
I'm gonna try to see if there's

12:52.505 --> 12:54.338
something else on her. And you?

12:54.341 --> 12:56.808
I'm gonna stay here and soak.

12:58.678 --> 13:00.758
And then I'm gonna catch
whoever tried to blow me up.

13:05.351 --> 13:07.285
Mama! What are you doing here?

13:07.287 --> 13:10.054
I can't visit
my daughter at work?

13:10.056 --> 13:12.623
Of course, but you
don't like what I do,

13:12.626 --> 13:14.592
so it makes me wonder
what you really want.

13:14.661 --> 13:16.460
Don't start acting
all detective on me.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.462
Well?

13:18.465 --> 13:20.498
We're in a bit of a spot.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.301
- What do you mean?
- Your father...

13:23.336 --> 13:25.970
that logging camp he's
been working at up north,

13:26.038 --> 13:28.640
it just up and went
out of business.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.675
- What?
- And they're not paying him

13:30.743 --> 13:34.078
three month's salary.

13:34.080 --> 13:37.515
Trudy, I can't pay
the rent this month.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.818
It's OK. I have money saved up.

13:39.853 --> 13:42.687
- I didn't want to burden you.
- Mama, it's not a burden.

13:42.689 --> 13:45.356
And if we need any more help,
we could always go to the bank.

13:45.392 --> 13:48.660
Banks don't help people like us.

13:50.664 --> 13:54.098
It's just until he
can find another job.

13:54.100 --> 13:57.001
The Clark family's gotten
through way worse than this.

13:57.037 --> 13:59.204
Mhm.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.942
I'm telling you, Mr. Conroyd,
it's a slippery slope.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.812
First they ask
for these maternity days

14:07.881 --> 14:09.881
and then where does it end?

14:09.949 --> 14:12.884
That's right. The Reds
are putting these ideas

14:12.952 --> 14:15.820
in their heads. And what happens
when they don't get their way?

14:15.856 --> 14:18.623
Remember what happened
in the Weston plant?

14:18.691 --> 14:21.926
Precisely. We can't
let that happen here.

14:24.164 --> 14:27.098
Don't worry. We'll find them
and we'll deal with them.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.873
You know, Frankie,
I just had no idea

14:35.942 --> 14:39.143
how interesting explosions are.
So for instance,

14:39.211 --> 14:42.780
there's something called
a blast seat and...

14:42.848 --> 14:45.383
Well, what's this?
Turkish coffee.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.119
Very exotic.

14:51.324 --> 14:54.392
And very strong.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.527
The explosion?

14:56.563 --> 14:58.730
Right.

14:58.765 --> 15:01.466
All the usual things
are being investigated.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.935
What was the explosive?
Where was it bought?

15:03.970 --> 15:06.103
But here's the big thing.

15:06.172 --> 15:09.473
There was a body
in the wreckage.

15:09.476 --> 15:13.477
- Has it been identified?
- Yes. It was a Conroyd employee

15:13.480 --> 15:15.947
named Henry Logan.
He was a bookkeeper there.

15:15.982 --> 15:18.016
So Henry Logan contacts me

15:18.084 --> 15:20.018
because he can name communists,

15:20.086 --> 15:23.821
but then someone kills him to
prevent him from talking to me.

15:23.823 --> 15:26.491
Well, how did he know
about the communists?

15:26.559 --> 15:28.960
- He must've known somehow.
- Maybe he was one

15:28.962 --> 15:31.696
and he was trying
to rat them out.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.804
Or he was killed for
an entirely different reason.

15:36.803 --> 15:38.769
Well, there is one more thing.

15:38.772 --> 15:41.172
The explosion with the horse
and the wagon,

15:41.207 --> 15:43.107
it's an almost exact duplication

15:43.143 --> 15:46.377
of the 1920 communist attack
on the Wall Street.

15:46.379 --> 15:49.447
- Stock Exchange.
- Horse...

15:51.417 --> 15:53.985
A horse may have
saved my life last night.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.857
So when I arrived
last night, the horse

15:59.859 --> 16:02.593
was just wandering around.
I'm sure it was the same horse

16:02.662 --> 16:04.506
that was leading the wagon.
I stopped to take a look

16:04.530 --> 16:06.264
and then the wagon exploded.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.699
So you think the horse

16:08.768 --> 16:10.668
was trying to warn you?

16:10.704 --> 16:12.670
But how did it get loose?

16:12.672 --> 16:15.673
Maybe it was someone with
a heart and they unbridled it.

16:15.709 --> 16:18.276
A murderer with a soft spot
for animals?

16:18.311 --> 16:20.544
Either way, this horse
might be able to lead us

16:20.613 --> 16:23.681
to whoever did this.
But it's a horse.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.616
Trudy and I are
following leads right now.

16:25.684 --> 16:27.418
Do you have time to take a look?

16:27.420 --> 16:30.021
Well, I do have a few days off.

16:30.023 --> 16:32.523
- Great!
- But how?

16:32.592 --> 16:34.558
There are an awful lot

16:34.561 --> 16:36.494
of horses in this city,
you know.

16:40.299 --> 16:42.433
Well, this might
give you a head start.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.436
I'm guessing the horse
kicked off this shoe

16:45.505 --> 16:47.772
- as he ran off.
- Oddlooking.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.840
All the more reason
that a blacksmith

16:49.843 --> 16:51.675
might be able to recognize it.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.744
Do you like horses? To look at.

16:53.747 --> 16:55.580
Perfect!

17:04.257 --> 17:06.390
Jacob, what are you doing here?

17:06.393 --> 17:08.792
Frankie told me
where you were. I thought

17:08.795 --> 17:11.529
you might need a lunch. Thanks.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.798
Think I could get a job here?

17:13.800 --> 17:16.067
Why would you want to do that?

17:16.102 --> 17:18.469
To make some money
for Ma and Pa.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.405
Mommy and Daddy
don't want you working.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.272
They want you in school,
getting an education.

17:22.275 --> 17:26.242
But they need my help.
Landlord wants two months' rent

17:26.246 --> 17:29.013
now that Pa's out of a job.
That's crazy.

17:29.049 --> 17:32.950
Yeah, and Mom's really worried
but she tries not to let on.

17:32.952 --> 17:35.152
Look. Everything's

17:35.155 --> 17:37.822
gonna be OK. All right?
I'll figure something out.

17:37.824 --> 17:40.224
It's time for you to go.
I'm working undercover.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.093
Just don't say anything.
Understood?

17:42.095 --> 17:44.795
- Yeah. Of course.
- And you...

17:44.798 --> 17:47.231
stay in school.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.938
Mind if I join you?
No, not at all.

17:53.940 --> 17:56.641
- You seem a bit off.
- It's just this business

17:56.709 --> 17:59.277
about Henry from accounting.
They found his body

17:59.345 --> 18:01.112
in the wreckage.
Did you know him?

18:01.147 --> 18:04.448
Only to see, but still.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.617
Mr. Scanlon's sure
it's the communists.

18:06.653 --> 18:09.654
Man. First the owner
and then Henry?

18:09.689 --> 18:12.623
The police have been accusing
everyone around here.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.792
I even heard they beat up
some guy in receiving.

18:14.794 --> 18:17.294
Some people are good
at hiding what they really are.

18:17.297 --> 18:20.631
- Yes, they are.
- I'll tell you what.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.600
Why don't you and me go
somewhere fun tonight?

18:22.602 --> 18:23.801
Us?

18:23.803 --> 18:25.937
- Is that a problem?
- No...

18:25.972 --> 18:29.173
No, I didn't mean it
that way. It's just...

18:29.175 --> 18:31.809
I try to be a proper gal and...

18:31.811 --> 18:33.811
I'd love to.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.680
Good!

18:43.689 --> 18:45.823
Excuse me.

18:45.825 --> 18:48.025
Excuse me?

18:48.027 --> 18:51.829
- Can I help you, Miss?
- Yes, I'm looking for a horse.

18:51.831 --> 18:54.165
This isn't a stable.
I can't help you.

18:54.200 --> 18:57.334
It's not just any horse.

18:57.337 --> 19:00.504
I'm looking for a horse
that's suffering from laminitis.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.907
You know your way
around horses, do you?

19:02.909 --> 19:04.909
No...

19:04.977 --> 19:06.911
but I've been to 11
other blacksmiths today

19:06.913 --> 19:09.180
and they all told me

19:09.182 --> 19:11.081
that that's what kind of horse
wears this sort of shoe.

19:11.084 --> 19:14.785
And I guess I'll be the 12th
blacksmith who can't help you.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.820
I've got better things
to do with my time.

19:16.889 --> 19:20.090
I've had a very frustrating
day, and I would very much

19:20.093 --> 19:24.061
appreciate your cooperation. You're a
morality officer. What are you going to do?

19:24.063 --> 19:27.331
How about I wait
outside your shop

19:27.333 --> 19:29.534
until the next time you try
to shoe a horse on a Sunday?

19:29.569 --> 19:31.535
And then I will charge you
with violating

19:31.538 --> 19:34.605
the Lord's Day Act.
You're kidding.

19:34.607 --> 19:38.376
- I do not kid.
- No, I suppose you don't.

19:45.418 --> 19:48.185
Yeah, I made this one.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.354
In fact, I can tell you
exactly which horse it was.

19:50.356 --> 19:53.090
Are you kidding me? Well, that
wasn't so difficult, was it?

19:57.130 --> 20:00.464
Drake Private Detectives.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.833
Frankie, you have got
to get down here.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.036
- Flo? What's wrong?
- It's about that body

20:05.104 --> 20:08.105
in the explosion. I've never seen
anything like it before. What about it?

20:08.107 --> 20:10.074
Just get down here!

20:13.279 --> 20:15.846
I've never been to the Ward.

20:15.915 --> 20:18.349
- Really?
- Good girls aren't

20:18.417 --> 20:20.318
supposed to go down there.

20:20.386 --> 20:24.054
- You know, Jews and Chinese...
- Coloureds.

20:24.123 --> 20:27.224
I've never met
any of them before either.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.526
Until you.

20:29.595 --> 20:31.796
I just heard what people say.

20:31.864 --> 20:34.365
How long have you
lived in Toronto?

20:34.433 --> 20:36.200
Almost two years.

20:36.268 --> 20:39.470
I'm from Grafton. It's about two
hours east of here on the train.

20:39.472 --> 20:42.072
Have you ever
had Chinese food before?

20:42.141 --> 20:44.875
No. Do they really
have chicken feet?

20:44.944 --> 20:47.345
Yes, but I would consider

20:47.413 --> 20:50.814
starting with the chop suey. OK.

21:05.665 --> 21:08.098
Excuse me.

21:08.101 --> 21:11.235
What just happened?

21:11.271 --> 21:13.404
That's Bart Wilkins,

21:13.472 --> 21:16.674
our milkman. He gets soused
most days and passes out.

21:16.676 --> 21:19.243
Everyone just takes their milk
and leaves the money they owe.

21:19.279 --> 21:23.247
But he was asleep
and the horse just... stopped.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.115
Murph, that's the name
of the horse,

21:25.118 --> 21:28.118
he's walked that route
every day for four years.

21:28.121 --> 21:31.455
So you're saying he knows
all the stops by heart?

21:31.491 --> 21:33.357
Yeah. If it wasn't
for that horse,

21:33.425 --> 21:35.226
Bart'd be out of a job long ago.

21:45.271 --> 21:46.970
<i>It's a day of firsts for me.</i>

21:46.973 --> 21:48.839
Never been in the Ward

21:48.841 --> 21:52.176
or a Chinese restaurant
or a speakeasy.

21:52.178 --> 21:54.845
To firsts.

21:54.847 --> 21:57.148
To firsts.

22:00.086 --> 22:02.252
You didn't just become friendly

22:02.255 --> 22:04.288
and chatty with me
by accident, did you?

22:04.324 --> 22:07.891
What do you mean?

22:07.894 --> 22:09.760
Of course I did.

22:11.830 --> 22:14.498
No... I think you
were prying for information.

22:14.500 --> 22:17.701
Gently, but you were.

22:17.704 --> 22:20.104
Was it that obvious?

22:20.106 --> 22:22.673
To me.

22:24.777 --> 22:27.077
I... help Mr. Scanlon.

22:27.146 --> 22:29.580
He's very worried
about these communists.

22:29.582 --> 22:32.015
He knows I make friends fast,

22:32.084 --> 22:34.017
so he gets me to talk
to new employees

22:34.020 --> 22:37.187
to see if they're... inclined.

22:37.190 --> 22:40.024
- Do you think I'm a communist?
- No.

22:40.092 --> 22:41.992
I don't. And I told
that to Mr. Scanlon.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.728
Was Henry Logan one?

22:44.731 --> 22:47.398
Not that I know of.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.800
Have you found any communists?

22:49.802 --> 22:52.736
Because I'm just curious
to know information about them.

22:52.739 --> 22:55.773
OK.

22:55.775 --> 22:58.242
I can introduce you.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.349
<i>Maggots.</i>

23:05.385 --> 23:07.385
- Maggots.
- What do you know about 'em?

23:07.420 --> 23:09.687
- Clearly not as much as you.
- They're what flies eggs

23:09.755 --> 23:11.722
hatch into.
Yeah, I did know that.

23:11.790 --> 23:14.024
Well, flies like to lay
their eggs in places

23:14.092 --> 23:16.104
where there's food for their
tiny little maggots to eat

23:16.128 --> 23:18.395
when they hatch. Places like
dead things with open wounds

23:18.464 --> 23:20.230
and flies smell death,
so they're right there.

23:20.233 --> 23:22.065
What does that have
to do with Henry Logan?

23:22.134 --> 23:24.034
In the autopsy,
the pathologist discovered

23:24.103 --> 23:26.069
a knife wound.
He was stabbed to death?

23:26.138 --> 23:28.572
Yes, and in that wound
were maggots. Burnt ones,

23:28.574 --> 23:31.074
from the explosion fire.
That means that the flies

23:31.143 --> 23:33.844
laid their eggs and they
hatched before Logan exploded.

23:33.913 --> 23:36.246
Henry Logan couldn't have
made that phone call to you.

23:36.315 --> 23:38.416
Unless he made it
from beyond the grave.

23:46.826 --> 23:48.692
Who's askin'?

23:48.760 --> 23:50.794
My name is Mary Shaw,
and I was hoping

23:50.797 --> 23:53.731
to ask you a few questions.
About what?

23:53.766 --> 23:56.633
- Your horse and an explosion.
- What are you talking about?

23:56.636 --> 23:59.403
Your horse was drawing
a wagon that exploded

23:59.439 --> 24:02.606
down at Conroyd Industries,
and I know that

24:02.608 --> 24:04.575
because it threw a shoe there,

24:04.643 --> 24:06.710
which I traced back here.

24:06.712 --> 24:08.979
I'm sure you see how that looks.

24:09.048 --> 24:11.293
I have nothing to do with
any explosions. Are you a cop?

24:11.317 --> 24:14.384
Well I'm a m...
it's complicated.

24:14.387 --> 24:18.489
I'm a morality officer
slash private detective.

24:18.524 --> 24:20.591
That is complicated.

24:20.659 --> 24:23.026
Now, what was your horse doing
down at Conroyd Industries?

24:23.029 --> 24:25.062
Listen, I'm not sure, but...

24:25.130 --> 24:28.165
yesterday, Murph and I
were doing our rounds

24:28.201 --> 24:30.367
and then, well, I guess
I must've fallen asleep.

24:30.403 --> 24:32.803
- These things happen.
- When I got up, he was gone.

24:32.805 --> 24:35.372
- Gone?
- Yeah. I thought,

24:35.440 --> 24:37.341
"Hell, somebody stole my horse
right out from under me."

24:37.343 --> 24:39.555
Didn't know how I was gonna make
ends meet. And lo and behold,

24:39.579 --> 24:41.545
Murph comes wandering back home.

24:41.547 --> 24:43.714
That horse has got
an incredible memory,

24:43.782 --> 24:45.649
especially for places
people give him treats.

24:45.685 --> 24:47.852
And where exactly
on your route did this happen?

24:47.887 --> 24:50.488
Just off of Parliament
on... Spruce.

24:52.792 --> 24:57.194
Mr. Wilkins... I have
a proposition for you.

24:59.031 --> 25:03.000
- I'm so glad you could attend our meeting.
- I'm looking forward

25:03.002 --> 25:05.269
to finding out even more about
the Women's Peace Cooperative.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.671
Would you like to take home
some deviled eggs?

25:07.707 --> 25:10.007
Not tonight, thanks.

25:13.111 --> 25:15.145
So they're
the agitators Mr. Scanlon

25:15.147 --> 25:17.447
was so desperately looking for.

25:17.450 --> 25:19.550
I searched high and low
until I found them.

25:19.618 --> 25:21.652
Yeah. Not what you
expected to find.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.654
They weren't trying

25:23.722 --> 25:25.556
to burn anything down
or ruin society.

25:25.624 --> 25:27.558
Just some women who are looking

25:27.560 --> 25:29.360
for a better place to work.

25:29.395 --> 25:31.628
Their roots are in
the suffragette movement.

25:31.697 --> 25:34.031
Getting the vote for women
was everything to them.

25:34.099 --> 25:36.900
Now they're trying
to change the world

25:36.969 --> 25:39.136
through peaceful means.

25:39.204 --> 25:41.838
It just made sense to me,
so I joined.

25:41.907 --> 25:44.107
You never told Mr. Scanlon?

25:44.110 --> 25:46.176
Of course not.

25:46.244 --> 25:48.245
I don't know what happened

25:48.313 --> 25:51.014
to poor Henry Logan or
to Mr. Conroyd...

25:51.083 --> 25:53.317
but these people didn't do it.

25:55.721 --> 25:58.989
So they bogeyman behind the
attack on Conroyd and his family

25:59.058 --> 26:01.391
was a ladies church group?
Yeah. Don't forget,

26:01.394 --> 26:04.128
they also supposedly
murdered Henry Logan.

26:04.163 --> 26:07.464
Do you trust Zelda? I mean,
she is a mole after all.

26:07.466 --> 26:10.934
You know, I think she's just a young
woman who tried to please her boss.

26:10.937 --> 26:15.873
Well, if Henry Logan was dead, then... then
who called me? And why is Henry Logan dead?

26:15.908 --> 26:18.008
Look, I hear bookkeeper,
I think fraud.

26:18.010 --> 26:21.345
But was he in on it or did he
just find out about it?

26:21.347 --> 26:23.347
Either way, someone
wants to blame

26:23.349 --> 26:25.349
his death on the communists.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.751
And that makes me wonder if
the home invasion was a setup.

26:48.407 --> 26:51.241
- Where's Bart?
- I'm filling in for him today.

27:00.419 --> 27:02.519
<i>- This is nonsense.
- Mr. Conroyd,</i>

27:02.521 --> 27:05.022
I can assure you, we have
very good reason to believe

27:05.024 --> 27:07.190
that communists had nothing
to do with these events.

27:07.193 --> 27:09.793
- Based on...
- Our investigation.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.862
What if I were to tell you
that I could name

27:11.930 --> 27:13.897
every single person in your
factory who is a communist?

27:13.899 --> 27:16.166
- They'd be let go.
- Well, I'm guessing that is

27:16.235 --> 27:18.902
the very least that'd happen.
Look, I paid you-

27:18.904 --> 27:21.238
- To find out who attacked
you and your family,

27:21.240 --> 27:23.740
and in my professional opinion,
it was not communists.

27:23.743 --> 27:25.676
Then who?

27:25.744 --> 27:28.912
Whoever it was, they knew
your home very well.

27:28.914 --> 27:31.348
This is ridiculous!
It was communists, damn it!

27:31.350 --> 27:34.084
Mr. Conroyd, you're succumbing
to the Red Scare.

27:34.153 --> 27:36.653
Your irrationality
is blinding you to the truth.

27:36.656 --> 27:38.889
And Henry Logan.

27:38.957 --> 27:40.924
How do you explain his murder?

27:40.926 --> 27:43.427
I can't. Not yet. But I will.

27:43.429 --> 27:45.529
And in the meantime,
I need a list of everyone

27:45.531 --> 27:48.332
who's been in and out of your
house over the last few months.

27:50.503 --> 27:52.903
Some unsolicited advice...

27:52.971 --> 27:56.340
don't let communists
become your white whale.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.655
Not hungry?

28:11.724 --> 28:14.258
Just all these goingson...

28:14.326 --> 28:16.727
They've gotten me upset,
I suppose.

28:16.795 --> 28:18.595
You know, Zelda,

28:18.664 --> 28:20.897
I don't think you've been
entirely truthful with me.

28:20.900 --> 28:23.066
What do you mean?

28:23.069 --> 28:26.403
And I haven't been truthful
with you. So, why don't we

28:26.405 --> 28:28.305
both fess up. It'll
make us feel better.

28:28.307 --> 28:31.875
- You think?
- I do. And I'll go first.

28:31.911 --> 28:35.145
I'm a private detective.

28:35.147 --> 28:38.915
I've been working undercover here to try
to figure out who attacked Mr. Conroyd.

28:38.918 --> 28:40.817
How could you? I trusted you!

28:40.820 --> 28:44.421
And I haven't
said a word. In fact,

28:44.457 --> 28:46.456
I'm sure the Women's Peace
Cooperative had nothing

28:46.525 --> 28:49.226
to do with this.
But something is going on

28:49.294 --> 28:51.614
and I need your help to try
to get to the bottom of things.

28:53.799 --> 28:55.766
Please, Zelda. Help me.

28:55.834 --> 28:58.035
Trust me.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.037
Just start from the beginning.

29:02.741 --> 29:05.709
Back home, we were poor.

29:07.612 --> 29:10.581
I saved and saved to come
to Toronto to get a job.

29:12.518 --> 29:14.684
My mother said I was a fool,
but I came anyway.

29:14.687 --> 29:17.988
And it was difficult.

29:18.023 --> 29:20.123
Lots of gals like me,
looking for work.

29:20.192 --> 29:23.293
I was ready to
pack it all in and go home

29:23.295 --> 29:26.663
when I finally found this job.
Then what happened?

29:26.665 --> 29:30.734
I worked very hard, and...

29:30.802 --> 29:32.869
Mr. Scanlon took a shine to me.

29:32.872 --> 29:35.038
And I suppose

29:35.106 --> 29:37.274
I liked the praise.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.810
And then one day,

29:39.878 --> 29:42.212
he told me he wanted
to take me for dinner.

29:42.214 --> 29:44.615
He seduced you.

29:44.650 --> 29:47.284
He was successful and rich...

29:47.352 --> 29:50.754
and wanted little ol' me
from Grafton...

29:50.756 --> 29:53.490
but he was married to a shrew.

29:53.526 --> 29:55.358
They all are.

29:55.427 --> 29:57.694
He said that he was leaving her,

29:57.696 --> 30:01.231
but he just had to arrange
some things first.

30:01.233 --> 30:03.433
And I was so happy

30:03.435 --> 30:05.769
I would've done
anything for him.

30:05.805 --> 30:08.639
So when he asked for help with
the troublemakers at the plant,

30:08.707 --> 30:10.907
I was happy.

30:10.976 --> 30:13.744
But he never left her.

30:15.781 --> 30:17.581
Looking back...

30:17.649 --> 30:21.051
I just wished I'd believed
in myself a little more.

30:21.086 --> 30:23.787
All you did was
fall in love with someone.

30:23.789 --> 30:25.856
It happens.

30:25.891 --> 30:27.891
All I wanted was

30:27.959 --> 30:31.261
what my mother and grandmother
never had... freedom.

30:33.599 --> 30:35.932
Why are you

30:35.935 --> 30:38.635
stopping here, boy?
This isn't one of your stops.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.289
Hello?

31:33.124 --> 31:34.858
That's right.

31:34.894 --> 31:37.827
Do you have a theory?

31:37.830 --> 31:40.664
I do.

31:40.666 --> 31:43.867
I think that the bomber
wanted the whole affair

31:43.903 --> 31:45.902
to look like
the Wall Street bombing.

31:45.905 --> 31:49.206
And for that, he needed a horse.
One that would be untraceable

31:49.241 --> 31:53.176
to him if killed in the
explosion. So he stole Murph.

31:53.178 --> 31:56.980
I didn't realize you guys
were on a firstname basis.

31:56.982 --> 31:58.848
We're old friends now.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.885
Anyway, I suspect they
saw Murph walking past

32:01.921 --> 32:04.854
with his drunken owner asleep
at the reins and they thought,

32:04.857 --> 32:07.891
"Well, I'll just unbridle this
horse and bring him back here.

32:07.893 --> 32:09.960
The drunken sot will
never know what happened."

32:09.962 --> 32:11.762
They fed him some grain

32:11.830 --> 32:13.763
and Murph never forgets a treat.

32:13.766 --> 32:16.066
So when I did the route
with him, he came back here

32:16.134 --> 32:18.168
- looking for more.
- And by here,

32:18.203 --> 32:20.971
you mean where it appears
Henry Logan was killed.

32:23.876 --> 32:25.943
There's a lot of flies...

32:25.978 --> 32:27.911
looking for somewhere
to lay their eggs.

32:27.979 --> 32:30.180
I think

32:30.215 --> 32:32.115
the body and the explosives

32:32.117 --> 32:34.184
were loaded into the wagon.
Murph was driven

32:34.252 --> 32:36.286
down to the Conroyd plant,

32:36.288 --> 32:38.188
and then... boom.

32:38.256 --> 32:41.091
Hey...

32:41.159 --> 32:43.193
this looks like hog hair.

32:43.261 --> 32:46.396
The same as what was used
to tie up the Conroyds.

32:46.398 --> 32:49.466
So this carriage house
was used twice.

32:49.468 --> 32:52.669
Once for the killing
and another time

32:52.738 --> 32:54.671
as part of the attack
on the Conroyd house.

32:54.673 --> 32:57.040
We need to find out
who owns this place.

32:57.108 --> 32:59.276
I did some asking
while you were on your way over.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.878
The owner died

33:01.914 --> 33:03.880
and the house has been
unoccupied for over a year.

33:03.882 --> 33:05.915
Do you have a name?

33:05.984 --> 33:07.851
Wilbur Higgins.

33:11.657 --> 33:14.191
<i>Miss Higgins.</i>

33:14.226 --> 33:17.127
Detective. Still working
on the case?

33:17.195 --> 33:19.830
Yeah. It turns out there's
been a new development.

33:19.865 --> 33:21.831
The rope that was used

33:21.900 --> 33:23.933
to tie you up,
the same rope was found

33:24.002 --> 33:27.237
in a carriage house that was
once owned by a Wilbur Higgins.

33:27.272 --> 33:29.706
That's your uncle,
as it turns out.

33:29.742 --> 33:33.209
- Isn't that a coincidence.
- It is, yeah,

33:33.212 --> 33:35.178
but that's not all.
A man named Henry Logan

33:35.214 --> 33:37.781
was murdered in that
carriage house. His body...

33:37.783 --> 33:40.216
I had nothing to do with that.

33:40.285 --> 33:42.919
Just tell me the truth, Fern.
It's better me than the police.

33:45.423 --> 33:47.524
- I let them in.
- Who were they?

33:47.526 --> 33:49.692
I don't know. My job
was just to let them in.

33:49.695 --> 33:52.028
I didn't want to know, either.
Go on.

33:52.031 --> 33:55.465
They tied me up to make me
look like a victim,

33:55.467 --> 33:57.934
but nothing bad was going
to happen to the Conroyds.

33:58.003 --> 34:00.236
They were just gonna take them
into the woods and leave them.

34:00.239 --> 34:02.705
They'd have gotten loose
and been able to get to safety.

34:02.708 --> 34:05.308
It was just to make it
look like communists did it.

34:05.310 --> 34:07.310
And who came up with this plan?

34:07.312 --> 34:09.612
Richard Scanlon.

34:09.614 --> 34:11.481
Did Conroyd know?

34:13.819 --> 34:16.018
So why did you do this?

34:16.088 --> 34:18.822
Richard often came here
to visit with Mr. Conroy.

34:18.824 --> 34:21.024
One day, he came
into the kitchen,

34:21.060 --> 34:23.059
started talking sweet to me.

34:23.062 --> 34:26.996
And the next thing you know,
we were... Well, you can guess.

34:26.998 --> 34:28.831
Mhm.

34:33.170 --> 34:35.304
<i>It's like listening to my story!</i>

34:35.306 --> 34:37.440
He used her,
just like he used me!

34:37.509 --> 34:40.243
Why would he do this?

34:40.312 --> 34:42.179
We think there might

34:42.246 --> 34:44.081
have been some fraud
going on at the plant.

34:44.116 --> 34:46.916
Either Henry was in on it with
Scanlon or he discovered it.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.818
It doesn't really matter.
Something happened

34:48.821 --> 34:50.652
between them.
Scanlon wanted Henry dead

34:50.656 --> 34:52.455
and the communists
were the perfect cover.

34:52.458 --> 34:54.724
But why attack Mr. Conroyd?

34:54.760 --> 34:58.361
Conroyd was so rabidly anticommunist
Scanlon knew he'd blame them.

34:58.363 --> 35:00.797
Henry's murder would just seem
like a further escalation.

35:00.799 --> 35:03.800
So Mr. Scanlon deliberately
tried to make me part of it.

35:03.802 --> 35:05.869
He tried to make
all of us a part of it.

35:07.772 --> 35:09.839
I once thought, "Gosh."

35:09.908 --> 35:11.875
"It sure would be something

35:11.877 --> 35:15.078
for me to get a job."
And I did that.

35:15.114 --> 35:18.014
But I let myself
be taken advantage of.

35:18.016 --> 35:21.451
- We have a plan. But we need your help.
- Count me in.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.419
Starting right now,

35:23.422 --> 35:25.889
no one uses me again.

35:25.891 --> 35:29.359
Trudy, Jacob was
looking for you the other day.

35:29.361 --> 35:31.795
- Did he find you?
- He did.

35:33.832 --> 35:35.798
He was pretty upset.

35:35.867 --> 35:39.035
He told me what was
going on at home.

35:39.037 --> 35:40.537
He shouldn't have told you that.

35:40.572 --> 35:42.639
I kind of made him.

35:45.610 --> 35:47.677
- What's this?
- A bonus.

35:47.745 --> 35:49.579
You can't do this!

35:49.581 --> 35:51.648
Well, the good thing
about being your own boss

35:51.716 --> 35:53.717
is you can do whatever you want!

35:53.752 --> 35:57.387
Thank you.

35:57.389 --> 36:01.558
I'm gonna pay this back.
Take your time.

36:15.574 --> 36:18.141
Why aren't you
wearing your uniform?

36:18.210 --> 36:21.277
- We need to talk.
- Now is not a good time.

36:21.280 --> 36:24.113
Maybe it's a good time
for your wife to listen.

36:24.116 --> 36:27.250
I know. I've not been around.

36:27.252 --> 36:30.220
But with everything
that's been going on...

36:30.222 --> 36:32.722
Maybe we can go away together

36:32.790 --> 36:35.124
next week. I have a business
trip in Niagara Falls. Have you

36:35.127 --> 36:37.761
ever been to Niagara Falls? No.

36:37.829 --> 36:40.396
It's really quite something.
Very romantic.

36:40.399 --> 36:43.199
Now, what do you
want to talk about?

36:43.202 --> 36:45.101
I have an admission.

36:45.103 --> 36:47.904
- Admission?
- Henry Logan and I

36:47.906 --> 36:50.207
had a little indiscretion.

36:50.275 --> 36:53.076
- What?
- Don't act surprised.

36:53.078 --> 36:55.878
Did you think I was just gonna
sit around waiting for you?

36:55.881 --> 36:57.814
Well, I suppose
I can forgive you.

36:57.816 --> 36:59.783
I'm not looking for forgiveness.

36:59.818 --> 37:02.519
Henry told me

37:02.587 --> 37:05.222
he kept a second set of books.

37:05.257 --> 37:09.792
- What are you talking about?
- Henry didn't trust you.

37:09.795 --> 37:11.794
So he kept some insurance

37:11.797 --> 37:13.896
in case something might happen.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.932
Here's the thing.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.934
If you don't want
anyone else to know,

37:18.003 --> 37:19.936
you're gonna set me up for life

37:19.938 --> 37:23.673
in that little white house with
the neat fence we talked about.

37:23.675 --> 37:26.676
I didn't think you
had it in you.

37:26.678 --> 37:29.345
I'm a modern gal.

37:29.348 --> 37:32.348
It'll take me some time
to get the money.

37:32.351 --> 37:34.584
This is the deal.

37:34.586 --> 37:38.187
You take it and go.
If I ever see you again...

37:38.190 --> 37:40.690
Believe me, you won't.

37:55.641 --> 37:58.107
You wanted to see me,
Mr. Scanlon?

37:58.176 --> 38:01.944
Yes. It's about
our friend, Zelda.

38:01.947 --> 38:04.514
She seems to have got

38:04.582 --> 38:07.717
this notion in her head that I had
something to do with Henry Logan's death.

38:07.719 --> 38:09.919
You? You wouldn't
do something like that.

38:09.955 --> 38:12.789
Something about a second set
of books and skimming.

38:12.791 --> 38:15.292
Now frankly, Zelda doesn't

38:15.360 --> 38:17.960
have the brains to come up
with a theory like that,

38:17.963 --> 38:19.996
so I'm wondering where she
came up with that idea.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.568
Who are you? I'm just a gal
who's trying to make a living.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.073
You don't want to tell me.
That's fine.

38:30.075 --> 38:34.043
But if I'm going to lose
everything, so are you.

38:34.046 --> 38:37.080
No, she isn't.

38:37.082 --> 38:40.149
You're working together.

38:40.152 --> 38:43.353
That makes sense. You're a team.

38:43.388 --> 38:45.288
Keeping all these young women

38:45.357 --> 38:47.223
you seduced happy
must be very expensive.

38:47.225 --> 38:50.327
Ladies?

38:50.362 --> 38:52.228
And I bet there are more
than just Zelda and Fern.

38:52.230 --> 38:55.565
That's why you were stealing from
Conroyd Industries, to pay for it all.

38:55.567 --> 38:57.701
You have a problem, all right.

38:57.736 --> 39:00.436
It's not communists, but you
tried to pin it on them.

39:00.439 --> 39:03.139
I guess you've
got it all worked out.

39:03.207 --> 39:05.909
It's a pity I'm
the one with the gun.

39:05.944 --> 39:07.944
You wanted to know
who the communists were?

39:08.012 --> 39:10.213
There's your answer.

39:14.186 --> 39:16.786
You're not gonna kill us all.

39:16.788 --> 39:19.555
In fact, you're not
gonna hurt anyone.

39:19.558 --> 39:22.058
Nothing but girl problems
for you.

39:34.072 --> 39:37.206
Flo! You look fantastic!

39:37.209 --> 39:39.609
Something special planned?
Yes, as a matter of fact.

39:39.611 --> 39:41.911
With your new friend?

39:41.913 --> 39:43.813
Actually, with another
new friend.

39:43.815 --> 39:46.382
How scandalous! I love it!

39:46.385 --> 39:48.951
I just thought you should know
the police came to the morgue.

39:48.954 --> 39:51.220
The blood in the carriage house
was Henry Logan's.

39:51.223 --> 39:53.390
Dick Scanlon's done for.
Good to know.

39:53.425 --> 39:55.258
Also, they arrested
a couple exPinkerton goons.

39:55.260 --> 39:57.760
Hired to rough up
the Conroyds, I'm guessing.

39:57.763 --> 40:01.564
Exactly. You know, Frankie,

40:01.566 --> 40:04.167
I've spent a lot of time alone
over the last few years.

40:04.169 --> 40:06.602
The morgue, school.

40:06.671 --> 40:08.571
I just wanted to be by myself.

40:08.573 --> 40:10.573
Flo, losing someone

40:10.641 --> 40:12.608
like you did,
I can only imagine.

40:12.611 --> 40:15.111
I appreciate yours
and Trudy's friendship.

40:15.113 --> 40:18.915
I appreciate feeling
like I'm a part of something.

40:21.152 --> 40:23.119
Well, strength in numbers,
as they say.

40:28.326 --> 40:31.094
Hello, Murph.

40:33.664 --> 40:35.598
You are the hero of the day.

40:35.634 --> 40:37.934
A hero deserves a reward.

40:41.606 --> 40:45.274
- You get that case solved?
- We did indeed,

40:45.277 --> 40:47.477
Mr. Wilkins. I just came by

40:47.512 --> 40:50.680
to thank you.
Well, to thank both of you

40:50.682 --> 40:53.449
for your help. I was just
glad to be of service.

40:53.452 --> 40:55.284
Mr. Wilkins...

40:55.287 --> 40:59.288
with Murph's bad hoof,
what's to become of him?

40:59.291 --> 41:01.591
Well, he's doing fine now,

41:01.659 --> 41:04.861
but if it gets much worse,
I could have to put him down.

41:04.863 --> 41:07.530
Well, might you retire him
before that?

41:07.599 --> 41:10.266
I can't afford to keep
a horse that doesn't work.

41:10.335 --> 41:13.035
Well... if it comes to that,

41:13.104 --> 41:15.304
I could take him off your hands.

41:15.307 --> 41:17.874
You don't strike me
as part of the horsey set.

41:17.876 --> 41:20.643
Well, Murph and I did get on
exceptionally well.

41:20.712 --> 41:23.846
And he isn't just
any old horse, now is he?

41:23.849 --> 41:27.250
No. No, he certainly isn't.

41:29.588 --> 41:31.854
You know, we might just
be able to work something out.

41:31.857 --> 41:34.858
Do you hear that?

41:40.765 --> 41:43.766
- So how did it go?
- You know, until today,

41:43.768 --> 41:47.336
I never thought it'd be possible to actually
have a discussion with a group of communists.

41:47.339 --> 41:50.206
You need to stop thinking of
them as some political ideology.

41:50.242 --> 41:52.019
You're not slow to offer
your opinion, Miss Drake.

41:52.043 --> 41:54.443
- When needed.
- So what do you suggest?

41:54.446 --> 41:57.480
Consider them your employees
asking to be treated fairly.

41:57.516 --> 41:59.782
We've always treated
our employees fairly.

41:59.784 --> 42:02.352
Do you pay the same wage
to the women as you do the men?

42:02.387 --> 42:05.233
- Of course not.
- Well, maybe that's the first thing you should consider.

42:05.257 --> 42:07.257
- That's unheard of!
- I heard Conroyd Industries

42:07.325 --> 42:09.192
is a forwardlooking company.

42:11.395 --> 42:13.763
Well, if the war hadn't
happened, there wouldn't

42:13.765 --> 42:17.233
be women working in the plant,
but they've proven capable.

42:17.235 --> 42:20.202
Times change.

42:20.205 --> 42:23.973
I suppose they do.

42:28.613 --> 42:30.513
So... what's next?

42:30.582 --> 42:34.050
The Women's Peace Cooperative
opened my eyes.

42:34.085 --> 42:37.119
- Did it?
- I wanna help.

42:37.122 --> 42:39.088
I wanna make a difference.

42:39.090 --> 42:42.658
- How will you do that?
- There's a lot of factories

42:42.661 --> 42:44.594
that could be better
places to work.

42:44.662 --> 42:47.564
I'm gonna teach workers
about their rights

42:47.599 --> 42:51.134
and how to stand up
for themselves. I know

42:51.169 --> 42:54.236
it sounds pie in the sky.
Not at all!

42:54.239 --> 42:56.739
Who would've thought?

42:56.775 --> 42:59.442
Zelda Purser - from farm girl

42:59.510 --> 43:01.744
to union organizer.

43:03.748 --> 43:05.748
You know, this time,
you're not talking me

43:05.750 --> 43:08.952
out of chicken feet.
I wouldn't dare try.
