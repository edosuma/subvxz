01:08.618 --> 01:10.254
<i>Frank always used to say,</i>

01:10.321 --> 01:12.189
<i>"Tell your story walkin',
pal."</i>

01:12.256 --> 01:15.692
<i>He was more philosophical
than your average gumshoe,</i>

01:15.759 --> 01:18.029
<i>but he liked to do his talkin'
on the move,</i>

01:18.095 --> 01:20.364
<i>so here's how
it all went down.</i>

01:20.431 --> 01:22.665
<i>I got somethin' wrong
with my head.</i>

01:22.732 --> 01:24.001
<i>That's the first thing
to know.</i>

01:24.068 --> 01:25.202
If!

01:25.269 --> 01:26.770
<i>It's like having glass
in the brain.</i>

01:26.836 --> 01:29.240
<i>I can't stop
pickin' things apart...</i>

01:29.306 --> 01:32.009
<i>twistin' 'em around,
reassembling 'em.</i>

01:32.076 --> 01:34.378
<i>Words and sounds, especially.</i>

01:34.445 --> 01:36.480
<i>It's like an itch
that has to be scratched.</i>

01:36.546 --> 01:39.883
Quit pullin' at it. You're gonna
make a fuckin' mess out of things.

01:41.485 --> 01:43.887
I got threads in my heads.

01:43.954 --> 01:46.490
I got threads in my heads!

01:46.556 --> 01:48.325
I got threads in my heads,
man!

01:50.227 --> 01:51.495
<i>And I twitch a lot.</i>

01:51.561 --> 01:52.929
<i>It's hard to miss.</i>

01:52.997 --> 01:54.965
<i>It makes me look
like a goddamn spastic,</i>

01:55.032 --> 01:57.834
<i>but if I try to hold it back,
it just makes it worse.</i>

01:57.901 --> 01:59.036
Ah.

01:59.103 --> 02:01.272
Shit, just help me out,
will ya?

02:01.338 --> 02:04.008
Like I said, a fuckin' mess!

02:04.075 --> 02:06.843
Jesus, Freakshow,
ruin another sweater.

02:06.910 --> 02:08.877
No, cut it closer.
Cut it closer.

02:09.645 --> 02:11.748
<i>Fuckin' mess is right.</i>

02:11.815 --> 02:15.252
<i>The nun said my soul wasn't at peace
with God and I should do penance.</i>

02:15.319 --> 02:17.021
<i>Frank said anyone
teaching God's love</i>

02:17.088 --> 02:18.655
<i>while they hit you
with a stick</i>

02:18.721 --> 02:20.590
<i>should be ignored
on every subject.</i>

02:21.258 --> 02:22.892
<i>Frank Minna.</i>

02:22.960 --> 02:25.329
<i>If you had to pick just
one guy to be on your side,</i>

02:25.396 --> 02:26.964
<i>he's the one you'd want.</i>

02:27.031 --> 02:30.000
<i>It's Minna's game.
We're all just in the lineup.</i>

02:30.067 --> 02:31.135
- Boys.
- Boss.

02:31.202 --> 02:33.237
Frank.
Frankly Frankady Franko!

02:33.304 --> 02:34.637
All right, listen.

02:34.704 --> 02:37.208
Here's the shot.
I'll be up on the third floor.

02:37.274 --> 02:40.211
Lionel will go to the payphone
in about 20 minutes.

02:40.277 --> 02:42.645
When they come, probably
three or four of them,

02:42.712 --> 02:44.014
when they come,
you call me here.

02:44.081 --> 02:46.616
I'll buzz 'em in.
Coney waits at the door.

02:46.683 --> 02:48.718
I buzz him in,
he stays inside.

02:48.785 --> 02:50.521
Lionel's listening,
sharp on the line.

02:50.588 --> 02:53.857
If you hear me say, "We have
a problem," hustle over.

02:53.923 --> 02:57.094
Coney lets you in.
The two of you come upstairs,

02:57.161 --> 02:58.329
back me up quick.

02:58.395 --> 02:59.729
What's going down here, Frank?

03:01.065 --> 03:03.367
I gotta keep this
under my hat, boys.

03:03.434 --> 03:04.801
Fat cats in hats!

03:04.868 --> 03:06.237
Them's the ones, pal.

03:06.303 --> 03:08.838
Let's catch a big score
and get fat ourselves.

03:08.905 --> 03:10.840
- Boss, we're not carrying.
- What?

03:10.907 --> 03:12.977
A piece. I don't have a piece.

03:13.043 --> 03:15.513
"A piece"? Say "gun," Gilbert.

03:15.579 --> 03:18.015
- Okay, I don't have a gun.
- That's what I count on.

03:18.082 --> 03:21.385
That's how I sleep at night,
you with no gun.

03:21.452 --> 03:23.521
I got a gun. You just show up.

03:23.587 --> 03:24.654
I wouldn't want
you chuckleheads

03:24.721 --> 03:25.822
coming up a staircase

03:25.889 --> 03:27.224
with a hairpin
and a harmonica.

03:27.291 --> 03:29.926
Hairy chin, harmony harp!
Quit windin' me up.

03:29.994 --> 03:31.761
With an unlit cigar
and a chicken wing.

03:31.828 --> 03:32.963
- Right, Brooklyn?
- Chicky wing ding.

03:33.030 --> 03:34.365
I wing that chick in the ding.

03:34.431 --> 03:35.899
Come on, seriously.

03:35.966 --> 03:38.135
Don't throw me off.

03:38.202 --> 03:39.503
Just give us the rest of it,
all right?

03:39.570 --> 03:40.803
All right, all right.

03:40.870 --> 03:42.506
Now, if I say,
"Let me use the can,"

03:42.573 --> 03:43.873
it means we're comin' out.

03:43.940 --> 03:46.243
Get Gil, get in the car,
get ready to follow.

03:46.310 --> 03:49.079
I might need to give
someone the slip. Got it?

03:49.146 --> 03:50.381
Yeah. Problem up the stairs.

03:50.447 --> 03:52.383
"Use the can,"
start the car. Got it.

03:52.449 --> 03:53.951
Get, gotten, got, gotcha!

03:54.018 --> 03:55.586
Lionel's got it,
just follow his lead.

03:55.653 --> 03:57.488
Oh, come on,
you gotta be kiddin' me.

03:57.555 --> 04:00.324
Coney, what did I say when I came
into the office last Tuesday?

04:00.391 --> 04:02.226
- What?
- Lionel?

04:02.293 --> 04:04.328
You hung up your coat, you put
your hat on the third hook,

04:04.395 --> 04:05.596
you said, "I just saw
a girl on the ferry,

04:05.663 --> 04:06.896
and the smile she gave me

04:06.964 --> 04:08.399
is gonna get me
through the winter."

04:08.465 --> 04:09.667
Then you threw your notebook
to Danny, and said,

04:09.732 --> 04:11.068
"How's a guy supposed to keep

04:11.135 --> 04:12.303
a marriage together
with 22 on the menu?"

04:12.369 --> 04:14.371
Like I said,
Lionel's on point.

04:19.176 --> 04:20.511
Sit on it, Bailey!

04:20.577 --> 04:21.579
<i>Fuckin' Bailey.</i>

04:21.644 --> 04:22.946
If!

04:23.013 --> 04:24.448
<i>Bailey's what my head
calls me.</i>

04:24.515 --> 04:26.783
<i>It calls me out
whenever I try to resist it.</i>

04:26.849 --> 04:28.718
<i>There's things
that calm it down.</i>

04:28.785 --> 04:30.554
<i>Gum, weed.</i>

04:30.621 --> 04:33.224
<i>Sometimes, something a little
stronger if I'm in bad shape.</i>

04:33.290 --> 04:35.492
<i>But if I try to put
a lid on it, it gets worse.</i>

04:35.559 --> 04:37.361
<i>If I get nervous,
it gets worse.</i>

04:37.428 --> 04:39.163
<i>If I get excited,
it gets worse.</i>

04:39.230 --> 04:40.030
If!

04:40.097 --> 04:42.032
<i>It's the argument I can't win.</i>

04:42.099 --> 04:43.167
Hey!

04:44.801 --> 04:46.237
Another Minna classic.

04:46.303 --> 04:48.205
Freezin' our asses off.
Don't even know the score.

04:48.272 --> 04:50.708
- What, you have big plans this weekend, Coney?
- Yeah, maybe.

04:50.773 --> 04:53.177
- Hot date?
- Maybe. Maybe I do.

04:53.244 --> 04:54.645
Coney Island!

04:54.712 --> 04:56.247
Coney Island hot dogs!

04:56.313 --> 04:58.015
Coney Island hot dogs
right here!

04:58.082 --> 05:00.551
All right, Freakshow,
just a little quieter, please.

05:03.853 --> 05:05.356
That's it. We're on.
Be ready.

05:22.172 --> 05:23.674
- Hey.
- <i>Hey, boss.</i>

05:23.741 --> 05:25.442
Bossy, bossy bitch!

05:25.509 --> 05:27.077
<i>You keeping it together,
Brooklyn?</i>

05:27.144 --> 05:29.113
No, no, no.
I got my gum.

05:29.179 --> 05:30.847
I'll keep it under control
when it counts.

05:30.913 --> 05:33.050
Like we said,
stay tuned in, pal.

05:33.117 --> 05:34.618
I might need
that head of yours later.

05:34.685 --> 05:36.186
<i>Yeah, I got you covered, boss.</i>

05:36.253 --> 05:39.089
I know you do.

05:43.160 --> 05:45.763
Hey, I think
your friends are here.

05:45.828 --> 05:47.564
<i>All right, how many?</i>

05:47.631 --> 05:49.233
<i>There's two walkin' up
the block, two out the car.</i>

05:50.267 --> 05:52.703
- <i>You see 'em?</i>
- Yeah, I see 'em.

05:52.770 --> 05:56.073
Jesus Christ,
look at the size of that guy.

05:56.140 --> 05:58.409
They got... They got
serious muscle with them.

05:58.475 --> 05:59.510
Is everything cool, boss?

05:59.576 --> 06:02.845
Cool as can be.
Just a little chat.

06:06.317 --> 06:08.952
<i>"Here lies
Frank Minna. Cool as can be."</i>

06:09.019 --> 06:11.622
<i>They'll carve that on his fuckin' tombstone.</i>

06:11.689 --> 06:13.757
<i>I don't know if it was
growin' up in Greenpoint</i>

06:13.823 --> 06:15.392
<i>or fightin' the Japanese,</i>

06:15.459 --> 06:18.195
<i>but he was cool under pressure
in a way you can't teach.</i>

06:18.262 --> 06:20.364
<i>I was just happy to
have a job on his team.</i>

06:20.431 --> 06:23.833
<i>And if there's one thing my
pain-in-the-ass brain does know how to do,</i>

06:23.900 --> 06:25.336
<i>it's listen
and remember things.</i>

06:30.274 --> 06:33.177
Gentlemen,
thanks for coming. Drink?

06:33.243 --> 06:34.745
We're not gonna
be here that long.

06:34.812 --> 06:36.113
Now explain this crap.

06:36.180 --> 06:37.581
Which part
didn't you understand?

06:37.648 --> 06:39.817
<i>How about the part
where you got the idea</i>

06:39.882 --> 06:41.385
<i>to go poking around after some
colored broad, for starters?</i>

06:41.452 --> 06:42.820
<i>She works for the committee.</i>

06:42.885 --> 06:44.088
She's a fuckin' secretary.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.489
We told you
to dig in on Horowitz,

06:45.556 --> 06:46.824
find something
we can shut them down with.

06:46.889 --> 06:48.225
There's nothing there, Lou.

06:48.292 --> 06:50.427
<i>You wanna know what's goin' on
in that report,</i>

06:50.494 --> 06:52.830
<i>that "colored broad" is doing most
of the legwork on Hamilton for 'em.</i>

06:52.895 --> 06:54.897
So I put some time
into that, too.

06:54.965 --> 06:56.400
You looked in
some funny places.

06:56.467 --> 06:59.069
What can I tell ya?
I'm a snoop. It's what I do.

06:59.136 --> 07:00.204
It's called being thorough.

07:00.270 --> 07:01.405
It's called
wasting our time.

07:01.472 --> 07:03.006
This is fucking Chinese,
Frank!

07:03.073 --> 07:04.475
If you need a roadmap
to wipe your ass,

07:04.541 --> 07:05.609
I can't help you, Lou.

07:05.676 --> 07:07.010
Walk us through it,
Mr. Minna,

07:07.077 --> 07:08.612
just to be sure
we're very clear.

07:08.679 --> 07:10.114
It's right there in ink.

07:21.191 --> 07:24.161
<i>Anybody else like to
offer a different interpretation?</i>

07:24.228 --> 07:25.662
<i>None of this
can be proved.</i>

07:25.729 --> 07:27.097
<i>That signature
is the real deal.</i>

07:27.164 --> 07:28.499
If you knew the man,

07:28.565 --> 07:30.067
you'd know why that seems
highly implausible.

07:30.134 --> 07:31.001
I checked it
against the others.

07:31.068 --> 07:32.469
That is his John Hancock.

07:32.536 --> 07:34.071
And the paper trail
backs it up.

07:34.138 --> 07:34.937
Think Horowitz
knows all of this?

07:35.005 --> 07:36.240
No.

07:36.306 --> 07:37.775
<i>Or you'd already
be eating shit.</i>

07:37.841 --> 07:39.576
<i>It'd have been in the paper
the next day.</i>

07:39.643 --> 07:41.311
<i>The girl,
she married? Got family?</i>

07:41.378 --> 07:42.746
<i>It's all in my file.</i>

07:42.813 --> 07:44.481
<i>Her mother's dead.
No brother or sisters.</i>

07:44.548 --> 07:46.683
- What about her father?
- Father's a busted-up vet.

07:46.750 --> 07:49.520
He runs a jazz club up here.
He drinks too much.

07:49.586 --> 07:51.422
<i>Mr. Minna,
I'll assume</i>

07:51.488 --> 07:53.923
<i>you're aware of what occurs
a week from Thursday?</i>

07:53.991 --> 07:55.192
<i>I am.</i>

07:55.259 --> 07:56.593
So then,
you understand

07:56.660 --> 07:57.995
our firm determination
to keep such information

07:58.061 --> 07:59.530
out of the hands
of our detractors?

07:59.596 --> 08:01.131
<i>Sure,
it's the nature of the game.</i>

08:01.198 --> 08:02.633
<i>But these are all photos.</i>

08:02.699 --> 08:04.368
May I hope you're in
possession of the originals?

08:04.435 --> 08:06.203
- I am.
- Excellent.

08:06.270 --> 08:07.905
Well, we'll need to
get those from you.

08:07.971 --> 08:09.306
I figured as much.

08:09.373 --> 08:11.241
I thought we could
talk about terms.

08:11.308 --> 08:13.243
What the fuck
are you talkin' about?

08:14.711 --> 08:16.046
Have you lost your mind?

08:16.113 --> 08:17.881
Let's not kid
each other, fellas.

08:17.947 --> 08:20.150
You got the biggest gravy train
of the century pulling out.

08:20.217 --> 08:22.219
I'm just asking for a seat
here in the rear.

08:22.286 --> 08:23.554
That's quite impossible.

08:23.620 --> 08:25.656
I'd double this
at any paper in town.

08:27.691 --> 08:29.226
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't say

08:29.293 --> 08:30.561
what you just said,
and we're gonna get...

08:30.627 --> 08:31.795
<i>It's just an observation.</i>

08:31.862 --> 08:33.297
<i>I'm here in good faith.</i>

08:33.363 --> 08:34.631
- <i>Just assessing value...</i>
- <i>You can forget it!</i>

08:34.698 --> 08:36.265
Jeez, Lou.

08:36.332 --> 08:38.335
What is your beef with a guy
gettin' paid for good work?

08:38.402 --> 08:39.837
As far as I can see,
you get paid

08:39.903 --> 08:41.638
for doin' nothing.

08:41.705 --> 08:43.039
- <i>Watch your mouth.</i>
- <i>Jesus, take it easy.</i>

08:43.106 --> 08:44.241
- Shit.
- <i>Open up your coat.</i>

08:44.308 --> 08:45.709
- What?
- Are you carryin'?

08:45.776 --> 08:47.344
- You bring a gun to a meeting?
- I had it

08:47.411 --> 08:48.745
- since the war, Lou...
- What the fuck?

08:48.812 --> 08:50.280
Listen, motherfucker,
I'm gonna have my friend

08:50.347 --> 08:51.648
<i>shove that right up your ass.</i>

08:51.715 --> 08:52.883
<i>Enough.
Lou, a word.</i>

08:55.385 --> 08:58.188
Oh, come on, fellas,
don't get in a twist.

08:58.255 --> 08:59.490
It's just business.

08:59.556 --> 09:00.824
Mr. Minna,
we do appreciate

09:00.891 --> 09:02.259
the service you've rendered.

09:02.326 --> 09:03.527
And these gentlemen

09:03.594 --> 09:04.895
will take you
to get the originals

09:04.963 --> 09:06.396
and if all is in order,

09:06.463 --> 09:08.365
we'll arrange an appropriate
resolution for you.

09:08.432 --> 09:11.335
<i>Of course.
Like I say, good faith.</i>

09:11.401 --> 09:13.437
<i>Just let me use the can first.</i>

09:15.305 --> 09:17.674
Come on, come on!
Come on, come on!

09:19.142 --> 09:20.377
Shithead hitter!

09:20.444 --> 09:21.912
- Hit him in the shitter!
- What happened?

09:21.980 --> 09:23.614
They hit him. They hit him.
I think that they hit him.

09:23.680 --> 09:25.048
Well, Jesus, Freakshow,
what are we doing here?

09:25.115 --> 09:26.583
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

09:26.650 --> 09:28.185
He said, "Use the can."
He wants us to follow him.

09:28.252 --> 09:30.787
Can the man!
Can the loose man!

09:35.859 --> 09:37.628
And this fucking guy.

09:40.130 --> 09:41.932
- I don't like it.
- Me, neither. Let's go.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.468
Shit!

09:52.142 --> 09:54.378
No, no. No.

09:54.444 --> 09:56.747
Shit. We gotta go,
we gotta go!

09:56.813 --> 09:58.649
Come on, come on, come on!

09:58.715 --> 10:00.350
Go, go, go! Fire it up!

10:00.417 --> 10:01.618
Fire it up, come on!

10:02.954 --> 10:04.588
This fucking guy!

10:04.655 --> 10:06.857
Eat me, Mr. Dickey Weed!

10:06.924 --> 10:09.059
Eat me, Mr. Dickey Weed!

10:11.094 --> 10:13.330
Come on.

10:13.397 --> 10:16.199
Left, left, left.
Lick me, Loose Lucy!

10:22.539 --> 10:23.907
There, there, there.
That's them. That's them.

10:23.975 --> 10:25.776
Don't blow past them,
don't blow past them.

10:25.842 --> 10:27.411
Slow down, slow down.

10:29.212 --> 10:31.748
Watch out! Watch out!

10:31.815 --> 10:33.183
Shit!

10:35.252 --> 10:37.187
You fuckin' blind?

10:49.533 --> 10:51.970
- The fuck?
- How'd we lose them?

10:52.036 --> 10:54.204
There, there! There!

11:00.310 --> 11:01.645
Where's he goin'?

11:01.712 --> 11:03.413
The ramp, he's goin'
to Queens. Queenie Coney.

11:03.480 --> 11:06.583
Queenie Coney. Queenie Coney.

11:06.650 --> 11:08.752
In the right lane.
Get to the right.

11:08.819 --> 11:10.120
Where the fuck are they?

11:17.361 --> 11:18.495
Son of a bitch, that's them!

11:18.562 --> 11:19.896
Come on,
we're gonna lose them.

11:20.497 --> 11:21.465
Come on!

11:21.531 --> 11:22.899
- Quacker, quoter, quarter!
- What?

11:22.967 --> 11:24.201
Quacker, quoter, quarter!

11:24.267 --> 11:25.435
- What?
- Quarter! You need a quarter!

11:25.502 --> 11:26.536
Get a fuckin' quarter out,
Coney!

11:26.603 --> 11:27.871
Why didn't you say something?

11:28.839 --> 11:31.208
Go, go, go! Go, go!

11:45.222 --> 11:46.823
There, there, there.
Go left, go left.

11:49.127 --> 11:50.394
They gotta be somewhere.

11:50.460 --> 11:53.664
I'd say they're somewhere,
Gil, yes. Where?

12:00.671 --> 12:02.706
Stop, go back! Go back!

12:02.773 --> 12:03.774
Jesus!

12:12.616 --> 12:14.484
Shit! Drop it!
We gotta get out of here!

12:14.551 --> 12:16.453
Come on, let's go!
Let's go!

12:16.520 --> 12:17.721
God damn it.

12:21.159 --> 12:22.359
Frank!

12:22.893 --> 12:23.961
Pull it up!

12:28.432 --> 12:29.833
You wanna
help me out here, please?

12:29.900 --> 12:32.502
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit!

12:32.569 --> 12:34.938
- Can you stand?
- Yeah.

12:37.975 --> 12:40.310
Coney, you lug wrench,
get my hat!

12:40.377 --> 12:41.411
Forget the hat, Frank.

12:41.478 --> 12:42.946
Get my hat, you fucking mook.

12:44.915 --> 12:46.516
Get my gun, too.

12:51.722 --> 12:52.957
Where the hell
are you going?

12:53.024 --> 12:54.491
I don't know around here.

12:54.558 --> 12:55.659
- Give me something.
- Well, head for the hospital.

12:55.726 --> 12:57.294
Jesus!
Hospitable herpetologist!

12:57.360 --> 12:58.462
Mercy Hospital.

12:58.528 --> 13:00.430
Up McGuinness,
you cabbageheads!

13:02.299 --> 13:03.934
- Ah, sorry.
- Pay attention!

13:04.001 --> 13:05.535
- If, if!
- Easy, pal.

13:05.602 --> 13:06.870
Sorry. Sorry.

13:06.937 --> 13:08.839
Put my watch and my wallet
in my hat

13:08.905 --> 13:09.840
and leave it in the car.

13:09.906 --> 13:10.975
Don't want anybody
stealin' it.

13:11.042 --> 13:12.676
The fuck happened, Frank?

13:12.743 --> 13:14.277
I took 'em on a wild goose
chase and I tried to slip 'em.

13:14.344 --> 13:15.579
Ah, we should have
jumped in sooner.

13:15.645 --> 13:16.981
I thought
you were signaling me off.

13:17.048 --> 13:18.949
No, not your fault.
I almost made it.

13:19.016 --> 13:20.383
I forgot they had my gun.

13:20.450 --> 13:22.886
Got through Guadalcanal
without a scratch,

13:22.954 --> 13:25.756
and I get shot with my own gun
in Queens.

13:25.822 --> 13:27.491
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

13:27.557 --> 13:28.993
They clipped me in the side,
but nothin' important.

13:29.060 --> 13:31.294
- Who? Who were they?
- Well, don't worry about it.

13:31.361 --> 13:32.696
Talk to me, Brooklyn.

13:32.763 --> 13:34.297
- I need one of your jokes.
- What?

13:34.364 --> 13:35.233
I need a joke.
Just tell me a joke.

13:35.298 --> 13:36.533
Guy walks into a bar.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.236
Guy walks into a bar
with an octopus

13:38.301 --> 13:39.603
and he says,
"I'll bet 50 this octopus

13:39.669 --> 13:40.604
can play any instrument
in the joint."

13:40.670 --> 13:41.838
Funny. Already in the black.

13:41.905 --> 13:43.673
I'm gonna fucking...
Fuck! Shit!

13:43.740 --> 13:45.442
Don't blow the punchline,
Lionel.

13:45.509 --> 13:47.211
Watch out! Watch out!

13:48.645 --> 13:50.181
Jesus,
what are we doing here?

13:50.248 --> 13:51.515
Almost there.

13:57.721 --> 13:59.056
What do you think you're
doing? Get this car out of...

13:59.123 --> 14:01.892
We're an ambulance today, pal.
Get someone!

14:06.429 --> 14:08.032
What do we got?

14:08.099 --> 14:09.766
Gunshot in the back.
Went out through the stomach.

14:13.137 --> 14:15.772
Hey, hey. Okay,
they're gonna fix you up.

14:16.807 --> 14:18.775
Squeeze my hand.
Squeeze my hand.

14:18.842 --> 14:19.843
Clamp.

14:19.910 --> 14:21.444
Stay with me, okay?
Stay with me.

14:21.511 --> 14:23.780
Oh, shit, Brooklyn,
she's in trouble now.

14:23.847 --> 14:25.348
Who? Who was that
in that room, boss?

14:25.415 --> 14:26.817
Played out of my league.

14:26.883 --> 14:28.718
I should have kept her
under my...

14:28.785 --> 14:30.988
Easy, easy. They're gonna give
you something now, right?

14:31.055 --> 14:32.056
Hand me two units.

14:32.123 --> 14:33.590
Morphine in.

14:33.657 --> 14:36.194
- Hey, Brooklyn...
- Yeah, I'm here, Frank.

14:36.260 --> 14:38.495
You're no freak.

14:39.462 --> 14:40.664
Yeah, okay.

14:40.730 --> 14:42.133
Stay with me, okay?
Stay with me.

14:42.200 --> 14:44.734
You were working for
those guys. Who were they?

14:47.071 --> 14:48.672
For... Formosa...

14:48.738 --> 14:50.107
Formosa? What is that?

14:50.941 --> 14:54.045
Formosa...

14:54.111 --> 14:55.645
- I don't have a pulse.
- Move!

14:55.712 --> 14:57.181
- You can't be here.
- Get out!

14:57.248 --> 15:00.084
Get out.
Get out! Get out!

15:10.460 --> 15:11.695
<i>A guy walks into a bar...</i>

15:11.761 --> 15:13.663
A guy walks into a bar...

15:13.730 --> 15:16.033
A guy walks into a bar...

15:16.100 --> 15:17.901
- A guy walks into a bar...
- We did the best we could.

15:17.969 --> 15:19.502
- A guy walks into a bar...
- He lost too much...

15:19.569 --> 15:20.637
Too much blood.

15:20.704 --> 15:22.505
He didn't make it.

15:22.572 --> 15:25.309
- I am so sorry.
- So sorry, Bailey!

15:25.375 --> 15:27.044
So sorry, Bailey!

15:30.181 --> 15:32.049
Frankly Frankady Franko!

15:32.116 --> 15:34.218
Frankly Frankady Franko!

15:34.285 --> 15:36.287
Frankly Frankady Franko!

15:36.354 --> 15:38.089
Frankly Frankady Franko!

15:39.056 --> 15:40.390
Frankly Frankady Franko!

15:44.061 --> 15:45.462
Then he said
he would take 'em

15:45.528 --> 15:47.064
to get this thing
and that was our signal.

15:47.131 --> 15:48.531
So, he's takin' them to get
somethin' that they want,

15:48.598 --> 15:49.599
and they off him.
That doesn't track.

15:49.666 --> 15:51.202
No, I don't know.

15:51.269 --> 15:53.170
It all happened so fast.
And we were just catchin' up.

15:53.237 --> 15:54.504
We barely saw 'em.

15:54.571 --> 15:56.173
How the fuck did you drop
so far off them?

15:56.240 --> 15:58.309
I told you, we lost them at
the bridge. They had a badge.

15:58.376 --> 16:00.011
They got waved through.
There was nothin' we could do.

16:00.077 --> 16:02.346
Freakshow's right.
It was a mess.

16:02.412 --> 16:03.780
So, who were they?

16:03.847 --> 16:06.017
He wouldn't say.
Even after, in the car.

16:06.083 --> 16:07.918
That's great, Frank!

16:10.021 --> 16:11.922
If, if, if!

16:15.126 --> 16:16.961
We gotta tell Julia.

16:17.028 --> 16:18.296
I told her already.

16:18.362 --> 16:19.729
When?

16:19.796 --> 16:22.366
She called looking for him.

16:22.432 --> 16:24.701
How'd she take it?
Timbuk-take it!

16:24.768 --> 16:26.636
How the fuck you think
she took it, Freakshow?

16:26.703 --> 16:28.438
Hey! Don't say that again!

16:28.505 --> 16:29.639
I'm not in the fuckin' mood.

16:29.706 --> 16:31.508
Yeah, all right, take it easy.

16:32.376 --> 16:33.877
I'm just sayin'...

16:35.545 --> 16:37.214
We all know how she can be.

16:38.715 --> 16:41.751
Somebody's gotta
take her his things.

16:46.357 --> 16:47.691
I'll do it.

17:00.937 --> 17:01.973
Hey.

17:02.739 --> 17:04.907
Take his, huh?

17:04.976 --> 17:07.211
You can't go out
lookin' like that.

17:10.381 --> 17:11.815
It's freezin'.

17:14.352 --> 17:17.121
- Thank you.
- You sure you wanna do this?

17:17.188 --> 17:20.057
Maybe she'll wanna know what
happened at the end, you know?

17:26.396 --> 17:28.031
He say anything about her?

17:29.866 --> 17:30.867
No.

17:31.868 --> 17:33.937
Help him out one last time.

17:34.671 --> 17:36.207
Lie a little.

17:45.449 --> 17:47.717
- Oh. Lionel.
- Hey, Julia, I...

17:47.784 --> 17:50.354
Yeah, don't bother.
The hospital already called.

17:50.421 --> 17:53.124
No, I got some of Frank's
things that I brought.

17:53.523 --> 17:55.026
Oh.

17:55.092 --> 17:56.926
I thought you were gonna
break the news to me again.

18:01.132 --> 18:02.932
Jeez, Julia, I'm...

18:03.000 --> 18:04.901
- I'm really sorry.
- Nice twist, huh?

18:04.969 --> 18:08.439
Didn't see that one coming,
I gotta say.

18:08.506 --> 18:10.940
Twisty, twitchy, twinky!
Shit.

18:11.008 --> 18:13.277
Look, I just want to be alone,
okay?

18:13.344 --> 18:15.845
Sure, sure. Yeah.

18:15.912 --> 18:17.982
You can give me that watch,
I guess.

18:18.049 --> 18:19.582
I don't want
the rest of that stuff.

18:19.649 --> 18:21.551
I'm gonna keep his gun,
if that's okay.

18:21.618 --> 18:23.720
- You want the hat?
- For what?

18:32.729 --> 18:33.930
You should have that.

18:39.836 --> 18:42.339
Was somebody with him
when he...

18:42.406 --> 18:43.907
Yeah, I was.

18:45.575 --> 18:47.011
Uh...

18:47.078 --> 18:48.912
He was talkin'
about you, you know?

18:48.979 --> 18:52.083
Yeah, don't bullshit me, okay?
I'm pissed at him.

18:52.149 --> 18:54.552
- No, don't be.
- Okay, well, I am.

18:54.617 --> 18:55.885
Pissing bitch!

18:56.686 --> 18:57.887
I'm sorry.

18:58.389 --> 19:00.024
Julia...

19:00.091 --> 19:02.759
did Frank say anything about
who he was meeting today,

19:02.826 --> 19:04.161
or what he was into?

19:04.228 --> 19:05.563
No, he didn't. No.

19:05.628 --> 19:07.664
- You got no idea who did this?
- No.

19:07.730 --> 19:10.267
If I figure it out, I'm gonna
make 'em regret it, though.

19:10.334 --> 19:11.634
I promise you that.

19:11.701 --> 19:13.170
Don't promise me.

19:13.237 --> 19:15.738
It makes no difference
to me one way or the other.

19:31.288 --> 19:32.289
If!

19:37.995 --> 19:38.996
If!

20:10.561 --> 20:11.761
If!

20:15.599 --> 20:16.799
If!

20:22.772 --> 20:23.974
If!

20:27.578 --> 20:29.113
If!

20:34.051 --> 20:35.052
If!

21:50.327 --> 21:51.362
Here you go, sir.

22:06.977 --> 22:08.178
Let 'em in, Charlie.

22:08.245 --> 22:09.846
All right, gentlemen.
Come on in.

22:11.248 --> 22:13.250
Watch your step. It might
be a little bit slippery.

22:13.317 --> 22:17.655
<i>I humbly accept the
responsibility of the office of mayor,</i>

22:17.721 --> 22:21.525
<i>and I accept the challenge of
serving the people of New York City</i>

22:21.592 --> 22:23.826
<i>faithfully and well.</i>

22:23.893 --> 22:26.597
Limited only
by our own vision,

22:26.664 --> 22:28.098
our own audacity,

22:28.165 --> 22:31.101
we will build the legacy
of our time.

22:31.168 --> 22:34.271
A legacy for future
generations to look upon

22:34.338 --> 22:36.507
and say, "Here was boldness.

22:36.573 --> 22:41.211
Here is the greatest
of what man can create."

22:42.812 --> 22:45.582
God bless you. Thank you.

22:45.649 --> 22:49.520
Thank you, my fellow
New Yorkers! Thank you!

22:49.586 --> 22:51.955
Do you solemnly swear to serve
the people of New York

22:52.022 --> 22:53.590
and uphold the integrity
of the office

22:53.657 --> 22:56.360
of Deputy Mayor
of Community Relations?

22:56.427 --> 22:57.428
I do.

23:03.967 --> 23:06.303
Ah. Mo. Splendid.

23:06.370 --> 23:08.905
Do you solemnly swear to serve
the people of New York

23:08.972 --> 23:10.274
and uphold the integrity
of the office

23:10.341 --> 23:11.709
of Commissioner
of the City's Parks?

23:11.775 --> 23:12.976
I do.

23:14.745 --> 23:17.314
Do you solemnly swear to serve
the people of New York

23:17.381 --> 23:19.283
and uphold the integrity
of the office

23:19.350 --> 23:20.917
of Commissioner
of Building and Construction?

23:20.984 --> 23:22.519
I do.

23:22.586 --> 23:25.589
Good to have you aboard, Mo.
Keep up the good work.

23:28.425 --> 23:30.828
Well, I'll be damned,
he did it.

23:30.893 --> 23:32.196
I told you.

23:32.262 --> 23:34.031
He's no pushover, this one.

23:34.098 --> 23:35.332
Ladies and gentlemen,

23:35.399 --> 23:37.401
your New York City
commissioner.

23:39.203 --> 23:41.938
10 bucks
it won't last past noon.

23:44.508 --> 23:46.577
Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!

23:46.643 --> 23:47.944
This way.

23:53.784 --> 23:55.285
And after all that,

23:55.352 --> 23:57.588
he voted for the wrong guy
in three different precincts.

23:59.623 --> 24:01.125
What is this shit?

24:01.191 --> 24:03.227
What about City Planning?

24:03.293 --> 24:05.162
See here now, Mo.
What is all this?

24:05.229 --> 24:06.764
Don't you play games
with me, you fuckin' mutt.

24:06.830 --> 24:09.333
Either I get City Planning
or I quit the other two.

24:09.400 --> 24:10.367
Right now!

24:10.434 --> 24:12.202
The reporters are still here.

24:12.269 --> 24:15.005
Easy now, it's nothing
to get hot about.

24:15.072 --> 24:17.274
It's probably
just an oversight.

24:17.341 --> 24:18.876
They forgot to
give me the blank.

24:18.941 --> 24:20.811
Just give us a day
to get settled in,

24:20.878 --> 24:22.146
and I'll see to it.

24:39.129 --> 24:40.330
Now sign it.

24:49.673 --> 24:51.008
Now give me.

24:56.547 --> 24:57.748
Right.

24:57.815 --> 25:00.150
Bunch of fuckin' amateurs.

25:02.886 --> 25:05.489
Close the damn door and keep it closed!

25:05.556 --> 25:06.990
<i>City sports authority</i>

25:07.057 --> 25:08.692
<i>reports new life
in negotiations</i>

25:08.759 --> 25:09.993
<i>with Walter O'Malley to keep
the Dodgers in Brooklyn.</i>

25:17.367 --> 25:19.536
Read all about it
in the <i>Telegram.</i>

25:19.603 --> 25:23.006
The Dodgers can stay if
the city will give 'em a yard.

25:23.073 --> 25:25.342
Read all about it
in the <i>Telegram.</i>

25:25.409 --> 25:28.612
The Dodgers can stay if
the city will give 'em a yard.

25:28.679 --> 25:30.481
<i>All these
wide-necked apes,</i>

25:30.547 --> 25:32.783
<i>trackin' mud
through my apartment,</i>

25:32.850 --> 25:34.918
asking all kinds of questions

25:34.985 --> 25:36.553
and I told them,
"Christ, he's dead.

25:36.620 --> 25:38.322
What, are you gonna
arrest him?"

25:38.388 --> 25:40.791
Fuck you been?
Called you all morning.

25:40.858 --> 25:42.192
What the hell happened here?

25:42.259 --> 25:43.994
Danny had
an early run out to Belmont,

25:44.061 --> 25:45.229
came in, it was like this.

25:45.295 --> 25:47.064
Cops were at Frank's place,
too,

25:47.130 --> 25:48.499
- going through everything.
- If!

25:48.565 --> 25:49.867
They were going through
my underwear drawer

25:49.933 --> 25:51.401
and they were grinnin' at me

25:51.468 --> 25:52.669
while they were going through
my underwear drawer.

25:52.736 --> 25:54.137
We're gonna find out
who did this,

25:54.204 --> 25:55.105
get to the bottom of it.
Right, boys?

25:55.172 --> 25:56.173
I don't even want to know.

25:56.240 --> 25:57.841
Always with this cryptic shit,

25:57.908 --> 26:00.377
telling me he's into
something big this time

26:00.444 --> 26:03.413
and that he's gonna
change our situation,

26:03.480 --> 26:05.716
and then he goes
and gets whacked,

26:05.782 --> 26:09.286
and leaves me $4,000
in a savings and loan,

26:09.353 --> 26:12.991
and a drafty shithole
at Lookout Point,

26:13.056 --> 26:16.159
and this thriving operation!

26:16.226 --> 26:18.662
The fuck am I supposed to do
with this?

26:23.300 --> 26:25.802
Look, the way I see it,

26:25.869 --> 26:28.272
you guys work for me now.

26:28.338 --> 26:30.741
I know you all go way back
with him, longer than me,

26:30.807 --> 26:32.709
but that's just the way
it is for now.

26:32.776 --> 26:34.811
I know the car service
was mainly for the books,

26:34.878 --> 26:39.082
but we didn't talk much about
how he ran the snoop work.

26:39.149 --> 26:41.084
And I ain't interested.

26:41.151 --> 26:44.221
So, I'm puttin'
Tony in charge.

26:44.288 --> 26:46.123
He's gonna run
the business of it,

26:46.189 --> 26:47.992
and then he'll keep me
in the loop. Right?

26:48.058 --> 26:50.761
Sure, doll.
It's the right thing.

26:50.827 --> 26:52.329
Sure.

26:52.396 --> 26:54.164
You want me to walk you home?

26:54.231 --> 26:55.933
No, thanks.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.169
I'm gonna go stay with
my sister for a little bit.

26:59.236 --> 27:01.672
I have to go figure out
my future.

27:01.738 --> 27:04.241
But give me a call. Okay?

27:05.009 --> 27:06.710
You know, for an update?

27:10.681 --> 27:13.017
- Hey, Julia.
- Hey, Lionel.

27:13.083 --> 27:14.351
Can't you ever cut that out?

27:14.418 --> 27:16.486
Touch it, Bailey!
I'm sorry.

27:16.553 --> 27:17.688
For once?

27:17.754 --> 27:18.622
If!

27:18.689 --> 27:20.757
- I'm...
- Jesus.

27:23.293 --> 27:24.494
What?

27:26.630 --> 27:29.232
Fuckin' assholes even took
the tank off the john.

27:32.302 --> 27:33.604
All right, forget that,
do it later.

27:33.670 --> 27:35.639
Right now,
just the four of us...

27:35.706 --> 27:37.608
Does anybody know
what Frank was into on this?

27:37.674 --> 27:39.343
He just said to meet him
for a sit.

27:39.409 --> 27:41.012
He didn't even make it
like it was a big thing.

27:41.079 --> 27:42.179
- He was nervous, though.
- Nervous how?

27:42.245 --> 27:43.413
He wasn't nervous.

27:43.480 --> 27:44.848
Were you on that line,
dumb shit?

27:44.915 --> 27:45.984
I'm telling you, I heard it,
he was nervous.

27:46.050 --> 27:47.684
Nervous Nellie!

27:47.751 --> 27:48.885
It was in his voice.

27:48.953 --> 27:50.921
He was trying to make a play
on those guys.

27:50.989 --> 27:52.656
There's somethin' goin' down a
week from Thursday that's big.

27:52.723 --> 27:54.391
And they were not happy
about what he found.

27:54.458 --> 27:56.060
Obviously.
They whacked him for it.

27:56.126 --> 27:57.661
Crack whacker! No,

27:57.728 --> 27:59.630
I don't think they meant to.
I think it was a mistake.

27:59.696 --> 28:01.465
When they shot him,
I think they fucked up,

28:01.531 --> 28:03.300
now they're stuck
looking for what he found.

28:03.367 --> 28:05.402
Big fuckin' riddle.
Jesus H.

28:06.336 --> 28:07.904
All right, I'm gonna say this.

28:09.272 --> 28:11.375
I loved the guy.

28:11.441 --> 28:13.243
And when we were
in that fuckin' hellhole,

28:13.310 --> 28:14.578
he saw somethin' in us,

28:14.645 --> 28:16.513
threw us a line,
taught us how to operate,

28:16.580 --> 28:18.016
but he never cut us in
all the way.

28:18.082 --> 28:19.616
And he played his own games.

28:19.683 --> 28:21.518
And I'm not stickin' my nose
around his dead cards,

28:21.585 --> 28:23.854
risk ending up
on a slab for it.

28:26.556 --> 28:28.225
I say we got
a lot of bills to pay,

28:28.291 --> 28:30.028
and we ought to
just get at it.

28:30.094 --> 28:31.395
You owe him
more than that, T.

28:31.461 --> 28:33.031
Yeah, well, you figure out
what the fuck

28:33.097 --> 28:34.966
it was all about,
you let us know.

28:35.033 --> 28:38.368
All right? Meantime, I gotta
finish up on the rabbi's wife.

28:38.435 --> 28:40.038
She's banging a butcher
who ain't kosher

28:40.104 --> 28:41.738
and I think he's really gonna
give her the boot this time,

28:41.805 --> 28:43.640
and that's gonna be
the last of that ride.

28:43.707 --> 28:46.410
I want Gil sitting on
that Gunderson fraud thing.

28:46.476 --> 28:48.812
- I'm on Gunderson.
- Yeah, well, I want Gil on it!

28:48.879 --> 28:50.048
- Why?
- Because

28:50.114 --> 28:51.615
when we make that bust,

28:51.682 --> 28:53.283
the insurance company's gonna
want us to go down there,

28:53.350 --> 28:54.518
show the pictures
to his lawyer,

28:54.584 --> 28:55.953
and I wanna make
a good impression.

28:56.020 --> 28:57.287
Okay? Frank ain't here
to cover for you anymore.

28:57.354 --> 28:58.689
- Fraud fag!
- Like I said,

28:58.755 --> 29:00.590
Gil's on it.
Danny will back me on nights,

29:00.657 --> 29:02.592
and, Lionel, you pick up
the car slack for him,

29:02.659 --> 29:04.494
just until something new
comes in.

29:05.729 --> 29:07.165
It's cold. We're gonna have
a lot of calls,

29:07.230 --> 29:09.199
and we need that business.
Fuck!

29:09.266 --> 29:11.201
Now, come on, let's clean up.

29:14.638 --> 29:17.175
<i>Tony, and Coney,
and Danny, and me...</i>

29:17.240 --> 29:18.875
<i>before we were Minna's men,</i>

29:18.942 --> 29:21.211
<i>we were just dead-end kids
at the Catholic orphanage.</i>

29:23.081 --> 29:24.514
Invest-ahead!

29:24.581 --> 29:27.718
<i>I was worse in there.
A total freakshow.</i>

29:27.784 --> 29:29.753
<i>No one knew
what to do with it.</i>

29:30.854 --> 29:32.656
L&L.

29:32.723 --> 29:35.126
Yeah, we have cars available.
Where would you like to go?

29:35.193 --> 29:37.427
<i>The nuns thought they were
gonna beat it out of me.</i>

29:37.494 --> 29:38.895
<i>One of 'em in particular.</i>

29:38.963 --> 29:40.263
<i>Till Tony grabbed
the paddle from her</i>

29:40.330 --> 29:41.798
<i>and said if she hit me again,</i>

29:41.865 --> 29:43.767
<i>he was gonna
give it to her twice as hard.</i>

29:43.834 --> 29:45.902
<i>Coney and Danny were standing
behind him when he said it</i>

29:45.970 --> 29:47.571
<i>and she knew
they weren't bluffin'.</i>

29:47.637 --> 29:50.307
<i>After that,
I was in their crew.</i>

29:56.047 --> 29:57.247
If!

30:10.460 --> 30:12.295
- L&L.
- <i>Who am I speaking to?</i>

30:12.696 --> 30:14.564
Ass-rog!

30:14.631 --> 30:16.500
This is Lionel Essrog.
I'm associate...

30:16.566 --> 30:18.535
Hello?

30:28.079 --> 30:29.613
Formosa.

30:30.280 --> 30:31.681
Formosa.

30:34.417 --> 30:35.919
<i>Frank was just
from the neighborhood.</i>

30:35.987 --> 30:37.255
<i>He was smart.</i>

30:37.320 --> 30:38.588
<i>Everybody knew
he was goin' places.</i>

30:38.655 --> 30:39.991
<i>Everybody liked him.</i>

30:40.057 --> 30:42.093
For my ass, Bailey!

30:42.160 --> 30:43.827
<i>He was friends
with one of the priests,</i>

30:43.894 --> 30:46.463
<i>and he heard I had a thing
for remembering.</i>

30:46.530 --> 30:48.565
<i>Numbers and words and things,</i>

30:48.632 --> 30:51.068
<i>and he had uses for that.</i>

30:51.135 --> 30:53.737
<i>He was the one that taught me
how to use my head,</i>

30:53.804 --> 30:55.772
<i>get it under control,
make it work for me.</i>

30:57.241 --> 30:59.843
<i>He took all of us
under his wing, eventually.</i>

30:59.910 --> 31:02.579
<i>Gave us a place
in this shitty world.</i>

31:20.298 --> 31:21.299
- Lionel?
- If!

31:21.364 --> 31:23.366
Oh, Jesus Christ!

31:23.433 --> 31:24.768
You scared the hell out of me.

31:24.835 --> 31:26.170
I thought
I was lookin' at a ghost.

31:26.237 --> 31:28.538
- What are you doin'?
- Spinnin'.

31:28.605 --> 31:30.640
- You back already?
- Nah, I'm on a round trip.

31:30.707 --> 31:32.409
I gotta go back soon.

31:32.909 --> 31:34.511
You okay?

31:34.578 --> 31:37.480
I should have never let him
get in that car.

31:37.547 --> 31:39.050
I think I blew it, Danny.

31:39.116 --> 31:41.751
I had a sergeant once
in the Bulge. Told me,

31:41.818 --> 31:43.887
"Sometimes you do everything
you're supposed to,

31:43.955 --> 31:46.656
and it all still goes
to shit." Hmm?

31:47.390 --> 31:49.060
It ain't on you, bud.

31:49.126 --> 31:50.493
Thanks, D.

31:51.062 --> 31:52.096
Any calls?

31:53.030 --> 31:54.397
Yeah. Oh, shit!

31:56.000 --> 31:57.068
I gotta go.

31:57.134 --> 31:58.468
I got a 2:30.

31:59.836 --> 32:01.239
Hey...

32:01.305 --> 32:03.975
did you ever hear Frank mention
anything about "Formosa"?

32:04.041 --> 32:05.142
Like the Jap island?

32:05.209 --> 32:07.544
Nah. He was wounded
and out before then.

32:08.179 --> 32:09.579
Hmm.

32:09.646 --> 32:12.549
There is that joint, Formosa,
in, uh, Midtown.

32:12.616 --> 32:15.152
I took Linda there
to see Chet Baker once.

32:18.022 --> 32:19.522
<i>Frank didn't have
to cover for me.</i>

32:19.589 --> 32:21.491
<i>He just never put me
into situations</i>

32:21.558 --> 32:23.327
<i>that were gonna
punch my buttons.</i>

32:23.393 --> 32:26.097
<i>Talkin' to people, gettin'
information out of 'em,</i>

32:26.163 --> 32:27.831
<i>that's the bread and butter
of the trade,</i>

32:27.898 --> 32:29.666
<i>but never my strong suit.</i>

32:29.733 --> 32:32.236
<i>Especially if a girl shows up
in the mix</i>

32:32.303 --> 32:34.838
<i>and, in this line of work,
they usually do.</i>

32:34.905 --> 32:36.207
Music's at 7:00.

32:36.274 --> 32:38.608
Yeah, could I get
an early one? Whiskey, neat?

32:38.675 --> 32:40.610
- Irish?
- Sure.

32:40.677 --> 32:43.047
Say, are you in here regular?

32:43.114 --> 32:44.614
Most of my life.

32:44.681 --> 32:46.583
You ever seen this guy
come in?

32:46.650 --> 32:48.551
Name's Frank Minna.

32:48.618 --> 32:49.786
Seen him around?

32:49.853 --> 32:52.356
Everybody looks like
everybody to me,

32:52.422 --> 32:54.158
but I don't think so.

32:54.225 --> 32:55.592
She's good with faces.

32:56.961 --> 32:58.162
Seen that guy?

32:58.229 --> 32:59.729
- Friend of yours?
- Yeah.

33:01.198 --> 33:02.967
- Nice face.
- If!

33:04.601 --> 33:06.003
Nice yourself.

33:06.971 --> 33:08.205
You got a light?

33:15.779 --> 33:17.847
A tease.

33:20.583 --> 33:21.785
Sorry.

33:25.655 --> 33:28.625
Jesus. Forget I asked.

33:28.692 --> 33:31.963
- Ass-talk, Bailey!
- Classy!

33:32.029 --> 33:34.531
You got somethin'
against blondes?

33:34.597 --> 33:37.901
It's gotta sound right
or I can't stop doing it.

33:38.601 --> 33:40.438
Must be inconvenient.

33:40.503 --> 33:43.873
Buddy, you don't know
the half of it.

33:43.940 --> 33:46.110
That uptown shit's
the real deal, huh?

33:46.177 --> 33:47.811
You get up there much?

33:47.877 --> 33:49.313
- Sorry?
- King Rooster.

33:49.380 --> 33:51.848
- I don't know it.
- Jazz joint in Harlem.

33:51.915 --> 33:53.384
Lucky's is a good time, too,

33:53.451 --> 33:54.718
but all the guys playing hard
are at the Rooster.

33:57.687 --> 33:58.990
Thanks a lot.

34:18.309 --> 34:19.641
We ain't open yet.

34:19.708 --> 34:21.643
Yeah, could I get
an early one? I'm freezin'.

34:23.981 --> 34:26.083
I'll take a whiskey, neat.
Keep it.

34:28.252 --> 34:29.753
Hey, you the manager?

34:29.819 --> 34:32.123
I look like the manager?

34:32.922 --> 34:33.991
Who's playin' tonight?

34:34.058 --> 34:36.559
Hey, Billy, who's on tonight?

34:36.626 --> 34:38.129
Mr. Bigshot.

34:38.195 --> 34:39.795
I hope they don't
think they drinkin' free.

34:39.862 --> 34:41.598
Well, you know they do.

34:41.664 --> 34:43.533
You know who's
gonna say somethin' about that.

34:43.600 --> 34:44.801
You caught this cat?

34:45.768 --> 34:47.271
I seen cool.

34:47.338 --> 34:49.106
This brother rewritin' cool.

34:49.172 --> 34:51.541
- I'll catch him next time.
- Don't wait long.

34:51.608 --> 34:53.511
These French girls
keep lovin' him up,

34:53.576 --> 34:54.744
he's gonna move over there
for good.

34:54.811 --> 34:56.612
French kissin' cats!

34:57.148 --> 34:58.215
Thanks, pal.

35:05.822 --> 35:07.358
<i>On my average day,</i>

35:07.425 --> 35:08.892
<i>the weed will handle
my twitching and shouting,</i>

35:08.959 --> 35:10.760
<i>let me get to sleep.</i>

35:10.827 --> 35:14.298
<i>But it makes
my thinking fuzzy.</i>

35:14.365 --> 35:18.102
<i>In my dreams, I'm calm and clear
like I was when I was a kid.</i>

35:19.836 --> 35:21.938
<i>Even after my head
started messin' with me,</i>

35:22.006 --> 35:24.141
<i>my mother
could settle it down.</i>

35:24.208 --> 35:25.775
<i>She'd sing soft songs,</i>

35:25.842 --> 35:27.311
<i>stroke the back of my neck,</i>

35:27.378 --> 35:29.746
<i>and it would leave me
for a while.</i>

35:29.813 --> 35:31.315
<i>We'd lie on the bed,</i>

35:31.382 --> 35:33.783
<i>talk about all the places
we were gonna go.</i>

35:52.136 --> 35:55.973
That "colored broad" is doing
most of the legwork on Hamilton for 'em.

35:59.876 --> 36:02.546
Christ, Coney,
did you get the shot or not?

36:02.612 --> 36:04.448
What? Doing what?

36:04.515 --> 36:07.084
Gettin' the... Gettin'
the paper ain't worth shit.

36:07.151 --> 36:08.852
The fuck's got to do
with his back?

36:08.918 --> 36:10.321
"Bendin' over," my ass.

36:10.387 --> 36:12.123
Look, I need him
liftin' the lawnmower

36:12.189 --> 36:13.823
out of the car
or playin' tennis,

36:13.890 --> 36:16.293
or spinnin' around the room
with some broad

36:16.360 --> 36:18.195
up on his tent pole
and his arms out wide.

36:18.262 --> 36:20.797
I don't give a shit as long as
it involves his back.

36:21.565 --> 36:22.765
Yeah.

36:22.832 --> 36:24.068
I know he's fakin' it, Gil.

36:24.135 --> 36:26.036
That's why he's won
three claims.

36:26.103 --> 36:28.905
Look, just wait him out
or set him up.

36:28.973 --> 36:32.076
I know it's cold. That's why
they call it winter!

36:32.143 --> 36:33.978
Fuck.

36:34.044 --> 36:35.446
I'm givin' him
till the end of the week.

36:35.513 --> 36:38.015
Hell, the guy could
lift a cow into a truck...

36:38.082 --> 36:39.849
Coney's still gonna
miss the shot.

36:39.916 --> 36:41.519
He still can't remember
to wind the film.

36:41.585 --> 36:43.053
He thinks it's a Tommy gun.

36:43.120 --> 36:45.822
I keep tellin' him, "Click,
advance. Click, advance."

36:45.889 --> 36:47.591
Can it! I'm givin' him
the rest of the week.

36:49.059 --> 36:51.761
Give me a fuckin' break, Gil.
What?

36:51.828 --> 36:53.830
Oh. Yeah, no, excuse me.
L&L.

36:53.897 --> 36:55.566
- We gettin' any rides?
- No.

36:55.633 --> 36:58.668
Nobody ever needs a ride on
Tuesday, you ever notice that?

36:58.735 --> 37:00.304
Never. What is that about?

37:00.371 --> 37:01.871
Tits on a Tuesday!

37:01.938 --> 37:03.107
Okay, thank you.

37:03.706 --> 37:04.707
Job?

37:04.774 --> 37:06.277
For me.

37:06.343 --> 37:07.877
Well, don't go gettin'
all mysterious now, T.

37:07.944 --> 37:09.846
You ain't no Minna.

37:10.314 --> 37:11.881
Yet.

37:11.948 --> 37:13.951
I'm going to pick up a prescription
for my mother, clam brain.

37:14.018 --> 37:15.519
You want all the details?

37:15.586 --> 37:16.886
All right.

37:16.954 --> 37:18.622
I'm goin' out for coffee.
You want?

37:18.688 --> 37:19.722
Yeah, cream and sugar.

37:19.789 --> 37:21.458
Oh!

37:21.525 --> 37:23.160
Okay.

37:23.227 --> 37:25.728
Meet the new boss.

37:25.795 --> 37:27.164
Mmm-hmm.

37:27.231 --> 37:29.133
Hey, D, if it's slow,
you up for something?

37:29.200 --> 37:30.267
Like what?

37:31.602 --> 37:35.272
Will you go sit on that place
for me? It's up in Harlem.

37:35.339 --> 37:36.307
I don't know it.

37:36.373 --> 37:37.608
I think Frank was there
that day,

37:37.675 --> 37:38.976
or maybe the day before,

37:39.043 --> 37:40.777
but it was in his pants,
it was almost full.

37:40.843 --> 37:42.246
- Fullsie pants!
- Yeah, well,

37:42.313 --> 37:43.414
maybe he just stopped in

37:43.480 --> 37:45.082
- for a book of matches.
- I don't think so.

37:45.149 --> 37:46.450
He was talkin'
about the colored girl

37:46.517 --> 37:47.985
who found somethin'
they were unhappy about,

37:48.052 --> 37:49.520
and he said her father's
a busted-up vet

37:49.587 --> 37:50.588
who runs a joint in Harlem,

37:50.654 --> 37:52.122
and this place is three blocks

37:52.189 --> 37:53.723
from where they had
that meeting.

37:53.790 --> 37:56.260
Mmm-hmm.
So, you went there?

37:56.327 --> 37:57.794
Yeah, and guess
who the manager is?

37:57.860 --> 37:59.463
He's a colored guy
with a bum arm.

37:59.530 --> 38:02.132
Oh, okay, what do you want me
to do about it?

38:02.199 --> 38:03.667
Just get in there, you know,

38:03.733 --> 38:05.935
see if you can get her name
off of them or something.

38:06.003 --> 38:08.372
Use your liquor board bit.
Lick Broader!

38:08.439 --> 38:09.673
I get her name.

38:09.739 --> 38:11.208
- That's it?
- No, sit there a while.

38:11.275 --> 38:12.942
See if she comes in.
Get her picture or somethin'.

38:13.010 --> 38:15.646
See if a colored girl
walks into a jazz joint?

38:15.713 --> 38:17.147
Let me make a prediction.

38:17.214 --> 38:19.016
Hey, asshole, I'm workin' it
from another angle, too.

38:19.083 --> 38:21.318
We'll put 'em together.
We'll figure out who she is.

38:21.385 --> 38:23.954
All right. Can I ask
why we're doin' this?

38:24.021 --> 38:25.689
'Cause he'd have
done it for us.

38:25.755 --> 38:26.991
You're right.

38:29.660 --> 38:31.562
Ah, it's fuckin' cold
for a sit.

38:31.629 --> 38:33.930
No, take the Bel Air.
That heater'll roast you like a brisket.

38:33.998 --> 38:34.999
Bet on the bris!

38:35.065 --> 38:36.500
What are you, a rabbi now?

38:36.567 --> 38:38.435
You don't want me handling
your bris, believe me.

38:56.220 --> 38:57.588
Can I help you?

38:57.655 --> 38:59.290
- Yeah. If!
- Bless you.

38:59.356 --> 39:00.958
Thank you.
I'm here to see Mildred.

39:01.025 --> 39:03.193
Mildred? There's nobody
by that name here.

39:03.260 --> 39:04.861
I'm pretty sure
it was Mildred.

39:04.927 --> 39:06.597
- Myrna.
- My mynah bird's Myrna.

39:06.664 --> 39:09.899
No. No, it was a colored girl
that I was speaking to.

39:10.734 --> 39:12.636
Uh... Josephine?

39:12.703 --> 39:14.505
Or Laura?

39:14.571 --> 39:15.739
- Mary.
- No,

39:15.838 --> 39:17.374
I'm pretty sure
it was Mildred.

39:17.441 --> 39:18.642
I was talking to her on
the phone about my application.

39:18.709 --> 39:19.809
What's your name?

39:19.876 --> 39:21.578
Betty.
What sort of application?

39:21.645 --> 39:24.148
For my vendor's license.

39:24.214 --> 39:25.783
Is this not
the licensing office?

39:25.848 --> 39:28.986
It's the Committee on Racial
Discrimination in Housing.

39:29.053 --> 39:30.120
Well, then,
you can't very well

39:30.187 --> 39:31.488
help me sell hot dogs,
can you?

39:31.555 --> 39:33.290
I'm so sorry.

39:33.357 --> 39:35.892
Wait. Mr. Horowitz
isn't here today, is he?

39:35.959 --> 39:38.162
- You mean Miss Horowitz?
- Either one.

39:38.228 --> 39:40.464
- She's in the back.
- Can you point her out to me?

39:41.031 --> 39:42.232
There she is.

39:42.865 --> 39:44.068
Hmm.

39:48.005 --> 39:49.939
You've been more helpful
than you know.

40:00.917 --> 40:02.052
We told you
to dig in on Horowitz.

40:02.119 --> 40:03.520
Horse a whip!

40:04.355 --> 40:05.556
Horse a whip!

40:45.696 --> 40:47.131
Shit, what happened?

40:47.197 --> 40:48.198
Jesus, Danny.

40:48.265 --> 40:49.867
Come on. All right.

40:49.932 --> 40:51.235
Come.

40:53.237 --> 40:55.339
Shit. You need ice?

40:55.406 --> 40:58.275
No, no. I'll take a shot.
You got one of those?

40:58.342 --> 40:59.343
Yeah.

41:01.345 --> 41:03.714
- Yeah, thanks.
- Who was it, D?

41:03.781 --> 41:04.982
Hmm.

41:06.949 --> 41:08.786
There was a couple of 'em.

41:08.852 --> 41:10.120
One was a giant.

41:10.187 --> 41:11.555
- A what?
- A fuckin' giant.

41:11.622 --> 41:13.657
I'm tellin' ya,
the biggest guy I ever saw.

41:13.724 --> 41:15.793
Worked me over pretty good.

41:15.859 --> 41:17.227
Murdered the camera.

41:17.294 --> 41:19.163
- Fuck. Did they say anything?
- Yeah.

41:19.229 --> 41:21.165
Uh... "Stay out
of Minna's garbage.

41:21.231 --> 41:22.699
Tell your crew the same."

41:22.766 --> 41:25.669
They had a big nasty knife
to my throat for that part.

41:25.736 --> 41:26.804
Those sons of bitches!

41:26.870 --> 41:29.406
But they didn't get this.

41:31.008 --> 41:32.409
- Assholes.
- The fuck is it?

41:32.476 --> 41:35.179
Giant-ass dog!
Ah, D, you're the tits.

41:35.245 --> 41:36.680
What are you two into?

41:48.258 --> 41:49.660
- You get 'em all?
- These are yours,

41:49.726 --> 41:51.428
- these are mine.
- Yeah.

41:52.029 --> 41:53.464
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

41:53.530 --> 41:55.532
- That's the same guy I saw.
- Yeah, yeah.

41:55.599 --> 41:57.401
- The bum arm.
- Forget all that, though.

41:57.468 --> 41:59.837
She doesn't show up till
sort of the end of the roll.

41:59.903 --> 42:01.171
Yeah.

42:01.238 --> 42:03.140
- Look, they come out together.
- Yeah.

42:03.207 --> 42:05.075
No, wait, but I saw her.
That's, uh...

42:05.142 --> 42:07.511
- Laura, they called her Laura.
- Laura Rose?

42:07.578 --> 42:09.646
Maybe that's Billy Rose,
if he's her father.

42:09.713 --> 42:12.082
She lives on the same corner
as the club.

42:12.149 --> 42:13.350
They must have made me early,

42:13.417 --> 42:14.651
as soon as I got out
to check it out,

42:14.718 --> 42:15.819
bam, they were on me.

42:15.886 --> 42:17.321
Yeah. That's her.

42:17.387 --> 42:20.190
That's the colored girl
that Frank was following.

42:20.257 --> 42:21.925
All right, I'm with you, okay?
It's just,

42:21.992 --> 42:23.627
- it's still a little thin.
- Skeletal.

42:23.694 --> 42:25.028
Thin? What?

42:25.095 --> 42:27.164
We already ID'd her.
We've been at it one day.

42:27.231 --> 42:29.533
Well, you know,
whatever it is, it's...

42:29.600 --> 42:33.103
It's gotta be big,
they're goin' this far, right?

42:33.170 --> 42:36.406
So, it's gotta be
worth something, then.

42:36.473 --> 42:38.542
I'll tell you what, Freakshow,
Gil and I,

42:38.609 --> 42:40.310
we'll stay on the money work,
just to keep us afloat,

42:40.377 --> 42:41.812
you and Danny
keep sniffin' this.

42:41.879 --> 42:42.880
Let's see what we get.

42:42.946 --> 42:44.047
- Fuck 'em!
- Yeah.

42:44.114 --> 42:45.315
- Right?
- Yeah.

42:45.382 --> 42:46.717
- If!
- I hope these mugs poke around

42:46.783 --> 42:48.185
'cause I got something
for them if they do.

42:48.252 --> 42:49.486
What do you say, D?

42:50.854 --> 42:52.122
Fellas, I...

42:52.856 --> 42:54.825
I loved him, you know.

42:54.892 --> 42:57.094
I mean, I'll, uh...

42:57.160 --> 42:59.296
I, uh...
I'll handle the car stuff.

42:59.363 --> 43:02.032
I'll work some domestic shit,

43:02.099 --> 43:03.433
but I got Linda.

43:03.500 --> 43:07.170
No, hey, hey,
that's the right thing.

43:07.237 --> 43:08.572
Get on home,

43:08.639 --> 43:10.274
- throw a steak on that eye.
- Yeah.

43:10.340 --> 43:12.376
I'll give you a lift.

43:14.979 --> 43:17.180
- So long.
- Yeah, yeah.

43:20.417 --> 43:22.753
What do you mean,
it might be worth something?

43:22.819 --> 43:24.721
I don't know, I thought maybe
we'll get something out of it.

43:24.788 --> 43:26.423
I ain't looking to make a deal
with these fucks.

43:26.490 --> 43:27.992
Forget that, then.
Look, I'm just...

43:28.058 --> 43:30.360
Don't you think I wanna
find out who whacked Frank?

43:30.427 --> 43:31.395
Yeah.

43:31.461 --> 43:32.729
Just don't hold out on me,
okay?

43:32.796 --> 43:34.565
We're workin'
on this thing together.

43:34.631 --> 43:37.901
We find who did this,
and we square accounts.

43:37.969 --> 43:39.403
If you say so, yeah.

43:40.737 --> 43:42.172
Wanna get a beer?

43:42.239 --> 43:43.907
- Nah.
- Come on.

43:43.975 --> 43:45.275
Come on. Let's get a beer.

43:45.342 --> 43:46.777
Come on, let's get a beer.

43:46.843 --> 43:48.012
Okay, leave me alone,
leave me alone.

43:48.078 --> 43:50.048
All right.

43:50.113 --> 43:51.682
Don't stay up too late,
kemosabe.

44:44.267 --> 44:46.403
Give up the seat,
asshole!

44:46.470 --> 44:48.138
Give her the seat!

46:14.725 --> 46:16.094
Hey, Gabby, they're closed.

46:16.160 --> 46:17.427
Oh,
you gotta be kidding me!

46:17.494 --> 46:19.830
- Yes...
- At 3:30? Ugh.

47:01.638 --> 47:02.974
Hey, pal,
I'm new to this beat.

47:03.040 --> 47:04.374
What's the story here?

47:04.441 --> 47:06.409
Stories of injustice
and despair,

47:06.476 --> 47:07.844
nodding assurances,

47:07.911 --> 47:11.748
and back to business as usual.
The American way.

47:11.815 --> 47:13.750
Though this one
could make things interesting.

47:13.817 --> 47:16.853
Hey, who's the, uh,
guy on the far right?

47:16.920 --> 47:18.655
It's Brooklyn
borough president.

47:18.722 --> 47:20.224
What are you,
a television reporter?

47:20.290 --> 47:21.491
No, just new.

47:21.558 --> 47:22.960
We'll commence
this public comment.

47:23.027 --> 47:25.196
State your name, address,
and affiliation, please.

47:25.263 --> 47:26.496
I'm William Lieberman,

47:26.563 --> 47:27.999
Mayor's Commission
on Slum Clearance.

47:28.065 --> 47:30.433
We'll arrange an appropriate
resolution for you.

47:30.500 --> 47:31.802
Resident of East...

47:31.868 --> 47:32.936
- Lieberman.
- ...65th Street, Manhattan.

47:35.806 --> 47:39.309
Cindy Fleming,
homemaker, Yonkers.

47:39.376 --> 47:40.877
Formerly East Tremont.

47:40.944 --> 47:42.679
My family was forced to move
when they seized

47:42.746 --> 47:44.714
our building for the Bronx
Expressway and I want

47:44.781 --> 47:46.316
- people to know that...
- Mrs. Horowitz.

47:46.383 --> 47:47.784
Miss.

47:47.851 --> 47:50.087
Miss Horowitz, you may not
hijack these proceedings

47:50.154 --> 47:51.755
- to air out old complaints...
- Gabby Horowitz,

47:51.822 --> 47:53.291
Committee for Racial
Discrimination in Housing,

47:53.356 --> 47:55.759
552 Clinton Avenue, Brooklyn.

47:55.826 --> 47:57.261
I thought that this was
a community hearing?

47:57.327 --> 47:58.728
On housing, not highways.

47:58.795 --> 48:00.630
You're making the same
promises to Fort Greene

48:00.697 --> 48:02.399
you made in East Tremont,

48:02.465 --> 48:05.303
where your so-called
"relocation services"

48:05.368 --> 48:06.837
vanished into thin air

48:06.903 --> 48:09.573
and left families like
the Flemings utterly adrift.

48:09.639 --> 48:11.175
People have a right to know
what they're in for.

48:11.242 --> 48:14.078
We are totally committed
to the welfare of families

48:14.145 --> 48:15.412
displaced by necessary

48:15.478 --> 48:17.514
community improvement programs

48:17.581 --> 48:21.085
and the past has been
instructive, miss,

48:21.152 --> 48:22.686
but our new contractors

48:22.752 --> 48:24.888
will ensure
all find adequate homes...

48:24.956 --> 48:26.756
This isn't Long Island,
you know.

48:26.823 --> 48:28.558
It's not just a blank canvas

48:28.625 --> 48:30.027
you can paint on
anywhere you like.

48:30.094 --> 48:33.197
There are people here,
established communities.

48:34.332 --> 48:35.665
Bill, if I may...

48:35.732 --> 48:37.601
I hope you all know my name.
I'm the mayor,

48:37.667 --> 48:39.603
newly residing
in Gracie Mansion.

48:40.370 --> 48:41.638
Uh, Miss Horowitz,

48:41.705 --> 48:44.108
thank you for your work
and your passion.

48:44.175 --> 48:45.575
Surely we can all agree that

48:45.642 --> 48:47.811
even in a city as great
as ours we have slums,

48:47.878 --> 48:50.881
and that slums are not to be
romanticized or preserved.

48:50.947 --> 48:52.116
You tear them down

48:52.183 --> 48:53.383
and improve quality of life
for everyone...

48:53.450 --> 48:55.719
A neighborhood is not a slum,

48:55.785 --> 48:57.088
because poor people
and minorities

48:57.154 --> 48:59.623
live there, Mr. Mayor.

48:59.689 --> 49:02.226
East Tremont wasn't a slum,

49:02.293 --> 49:03.995
Third Avenue wasn't a slum,

49:04.061 --> 49:06.596
and Fort Greene isn't a slum,
either.

49:06.663 --> 49:08.698
These are working-class
communities.

49:08.765 --> 49:12.103
Your developers are making
them slums, Mr. Randolph!

49:12.169 --> 49:14.905
That is unsubstantiated
and unmitigated bunk!

49:14.972 --> 49:16.539
We have
got it on paper.

49:16.606 --> 49:17.975
We got 20 people here tonight

49:18.042 --> 49:19.243
and scores behind them

49:19.310 --> 49:22.545
who can testify to
a scandalous fraud underway.

49:22.612 --> 49:23.981
Which way
do you want it first?

49:26.317 --> 49:27.450
Hey, hey, hey!

49:27.517 --> 49:28.885
We are embarking

49:28.953 --> 49:30.487
on the most ambitious
slum clearance program

49:30.553 --> 49:32.189
in American history,
Mrs. Horowitz,

49:32.256 --> 49:35.026
and you are gumming it up
with your molasses!

49:35.092 --> 49:36.793
A Niagara of molasses!

49:36.860 --> 49:39.030
Make him say his name!

49:39.096 --> 49:41.132
Name and place of residence
like everyone else!

49:41.198 --> 49:44.534
Now, see here, we all know
perfectly well who this is.

49:44.601 --> 49:46.404
Mo Randolph is one of our
greatest public servants.

49:46.469 --> 49:47.771
He's a living legend.

49:47.837 --> 49:50.374
Name and residence,
like everybody else!

49:50.473 --> 49:51.808
Shiver shitty self!

49:51.875 --> 49:53.910
He's led the Parks Department
for over 30 years.

49:53.978 --> 49:55.246
He's Commissioner
of Construction.

49:55.313 --> 49:56.780
He's got
too many jobs to name.

49:56.846 --> 49:59.116
And he lives right across
the street from me on 88th.

49:59.183 --> 50:01.085
Make him say it!

50:01.152 --> 50:02.552
So, let's stick to the
issues concerning the citizens of...

50:02.619 --> 50:04.121
Name, address!

50:04.188 --> 50:05.122
See here now,
if we can't keep this civil...

50:05.189 --> 50:06.257
Say it!

50:06.324 --> 50:08.292
...we'll have to ask you
to leave!

50:08.359 --> 50:09.559
Say it!

50:10.428 --> 50:11.429
Hey!

50:16.566 --> 50:19.303
Two fuckin' pigs in a blanket!
Ow!

50:19.370 --> 50:21.938
Hey! Say it, Hammy House Head!

50:22.006 --> 50:25.176
Say it! Say it! Say it!

50:30.680 --> 50:32.882
I got a condition.
Easy!

50:33.683 --> 50:35.485
"Hammy Ham House Head"?

50:35.552 --> 50:37.154
That's good.
I gotta remember that one.

50:37.221 --> 50:38.655
- If!
- Yeah, well,

50:38.722 --> 50:41.491
that's the rub in life,
all right, if. If only.

50:41.558 --> 50:42.926
Hey...

50:42.994 --> 50:44.594
You know things about
that guy, Bill Lieberman?

50:44.661 --> 50:45.929
Is he in charge of
this whole housing deal?

50:45.997 --> 50:47.731
Charge?
No, he's not in charge.

50:47.797 --> 50:49.899
More in charge than that guy
calling himself the mayor,

50:49.967 --> 50:52.635
but they all work for Moses.

50:54.238 --> 50:55.839
Hey, hey, stop, stop,
wait a second.

50:55.905 --> 50:57.574
- Let me go. You nuts?
- You just said Formosa.

50:57.640 --> 50:59.043
- What is that?
- What's Formosa?

50:59.110 --> 51:00.810
You said, "Working Formosa."
What does that mean?

51:00.877 --> 51:03.546
No, Jesus, I said, "They're
all working for Moses."

51:03.613 --> 51:05.249
Moses Randolph.

51:06.583 --> 51:08.319
Mo Randolph?
The guy who walked in late?

51:08.386 --> 51:11.055
He who will not speak his name
like one of the rabble.

51:11.122 --> 51:12.189
What do you care?

51:12.256 --> 51:13.857
Hey, hey, um...

51:13.923 --> 51:16.293
I'm Jake Gleason.
I'm with the <i>Post.</i>

51:16.360 --> 51:18.661
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

51:18.728 --> 51:21.298
I'm hungry.
You can buy me dinner.

51:23.700 --> 51:24.901
Okay,
that means the one guy

51:24.969 --> 51:26.303
answers to the other guy,
but they all

51:26.370 --> 51:27.737
- gotta answer to the mayor.
- The mayor?

51:27.804 --> 51:29.140
That clown is so green,

51:29.206 --> 51:31.075
he doesn't even know
what he doesn't know yet.

51:31.142 --> 51:33.543
He'll be out the door
before he even realizes

51:33.610 --> 51:35.079
that every person
he turns to for advice

51:35.146 --> 51:36.679
- is on Randolph's payroll.
- I thought he was

51:36.746 --> 51:38.215
- the parks commissioner.
- He is.

51:38.282 --> 51:39.716
But they called him
the construction commissioner

51:39.783 --> 51:41.052
- in there.
- He's that, too, now,

51:41.118 --> 51:42.786
but they didn't even
have that position

51:42.852 --> 51:45.222
until the Feds decided
to get in the housing game.

51:45.289 --> 51:46.856
There was no defined power,

51:46.923 --> 51:49.126
so he defined it,
they approved it

51:49.193 --> 51:50.294
and now how much control

51:50.361 --> 51:51.895
over that money
has the city got? Zero.

51:51.962 --> 51:53.264
He's got it all. You know

51:53.330 --> 51:54.798
- what "eminent domain" is?
- I think, yeah...

51:54.864 --> 51:57.334
Yeah, if he says it's a slum,
it goes.

51:57.401 --> 51:58.802
He used to have to fight

51:58.868 --> 52:00.438
to put his highways and parks
where he wanted,

52:00.504 --> 52:02.672
and now, he goes anywhere,
tears anything down.

52:02.739 --> 52:05.742
He can condemn
a whole section of the city,

52:05.809 --> 52:06.810
evict everyone
who lives there,

52:06.876 --> 52:08.112
and put up what he wants.

52:08.179 --> 52:09.779
And he'll go at it
with an axe.

52:09.846 --> 52:11.182
Smacks with an axe!

52:11.248 --> 52:12.816
But he'd be the most
hated guy in the city.

52:12.882 --> 52:14.318
I mean,
he'd piss everybody off.

52:14.385 --> 52:15.819
They love him.

52:16.653 --> 52:18.556
That's what makes me so...

52:18.621 --> 52:21.058
He flies above it.
They revere him.

52:21.125 --> 52:24.061
- Why?
- Because he built the parks.

52:24.128 --> 52:27.331
As long as you're the guy
that brings people parks,

52:27.398 --> 52:29.599
you walk with the angels,
you can't lose.

52:29.666 --> 52:31.268
The day that
Rockaway Beach opened,

52:31.335 --> 52:34.071
Moses Randolph became
a folk hero in this town.

52:34.138 --> 52:36.673
People don't realize
how much he hates them.

52:36.739 --> 52:39.609
"The hero of the public
who hates people."

52:39.676 --> 52:40.844
That's your headline.

52:40.910 --> 52:43.947
And you know
who he hates especially?

52:44.014 --> 52:45.015
Negroes.

52:45.082 --> 52:46.749
He's going to seize
every neighborhood

52:46.816 --> 52:48.352
in this city that's not white

52:48.419 --> 52:50.955
and turn it over to his
handpicked private developers.

52:51.021 --> 52:52.223
So, you're saying
he's getting rich,

52:52.289 --> 52:53.790
he's taking kickbacks
on all this?

52:53.857 --> 52:55.392
No, he doesn't want money.
He wants control.

52:55.459 --> 52:58.162
And he brokers money
to get it and guard it.

52:58.229 --> 53:01.232
Some guys aren't satisfied
unless they have filet mignon.

53:01.298 --> 53:04.034
Moses Randolph
would be satisfied

53:04.101 --> 53:06.504
with a pastrami sandwich
and power.

53:06.570 --> 53:08.771
Hey, uh, excuse me.

53:08.838 --> 53:10.007
Could I get
a slice of cheesecake?

53:10.074 --> 53:11.375
Could you make it warm?

53:11.442 --> 53:12.909
I'd like it warm.

53:12.977 --> 53:15.879
Half the city is getting
a ride on one of his horses.

53:15.945 --> 53:17.414
For God's sakes, he controls

53:17.481 --> 53:19.483
every fuckin' construction job
in the city.

53:19.550 --> 53:21.651
But you said they just
created the position.

53:21.718 --> 53:23.954
No. Construction,
slums, parks.

53:24.021 --> 53:25.189
He's got 14 appointments.

53:25.256 --> 53:27.224
It's all just ink
on a glass door.

53:27.291 --> 53:29.226
None of it matters.
It's all BA.

53:29.293 --> 53:30.793
BA?

53:30.860 --> 53:33.030
Borough Authority.

53:33.097 --> 53:35.599
You call yourself a reporter?
On what?

53:35.665 --> 53:37.268
- The arts beat?
- Beet farts!

53:37.334 --> 53:39.036
- You read Emerson?
- No, should I?

53:39.103 --> 53:41.938
- Yeah, you fucking should.
- All right.

53:42.006 --> 53:45.042
Emerson said that
"an institution

53:45.109 --> 53:47.978
is the lengthened shadow
of one man."

53:48.045 --> 53:50.314
<i>This town is run
by the Borough Authority</i>

53:50.381 --> 53:54.185
<i>and the Borough Authority
is Moses Randolph.</i>

54:03.227 --> 54:04.428
If!

54:41.332 --> 54:42.399
Fucking Lieberman.

54:42.466 --> 54:44.101
If!

54:54.311 --> 54:55.878
<i>That quack in the diner</i>

54:55.945 --> 54:57.648
<i>with pork chop
and peas in his beard</i>

54:57.715 --> 55:00.351
<i>was one of the most talented
engineers of his generation.</i>

55:00.417 --> 55:02.885
<i>Ivy League.
Big awards.</i>

55:02.953 --> 55:04.421
<i>Walkin' right next
to his brother</i>

55:04.488 --> 55:06.523
<i>toward being
someone important.</i>

55:06.590 --> 55:09.193
<i>Then, sometime
after the Crash, just...</i>

55:09.260 --> 55:10.094
<i>nothing.</i>

55:10.160 --> 55:12.963
<i>Like he got erased.</i>

55:13.030 --> 55:15.733
<i>Maybe it was bad luck,
maybe booze.</i>

55:15.798 --> 55:18.736
<i>There was all kinds of
casualties in those days.</i>

55:18.801 --> 55:20.337
Ladies and gentlemen,

55:20.404 --> 55:21.672
please welcome

55:21.739 --> 55:25.276
the president of the Gotham
Builders Association,

55:25.342 --> 55:28.379
Joe Pompano!

55:31.948 --> 55:33.783
Gotta show this
to Bill Lieberman.

55:33.850 --> 55:37.388
He's gonna want to see this before
Randolph speaks, believe me.

55:41.492 --> 55:42.925
Thank you. Thank you,

55:42.993 --> 55:45.895
ladies and gentlemen.
Please settle down

55:45.963 --> 55:48.732
and lend
your serious attention.

55:48.798 --> 55:50.100
Don't worry. We'll celebrate.

55:50.167 --> 55:53.570
We're gonna eat like
only we know how to eat.

55:53.637 --> 55:56.674
Tonight's celebration
is made very special

55:56.740 --> 55:58.375
by our guest of honor,

55:58.442 --> 55:59.942
a brother to our trade...

56:00.010 --> 56:01.378
- Hey, Gleason, right?
- Hey.

56:01.445 --> 56:02.945
...who would rightly be hailed
this country's

56:03.013 --> 56:04.615
- master builder...
- Nice threads.

56:04.682 --> 56:08.285
...or "the Great Dirt Mover"

56:08.352 --> 56:09.953
as he likes to be called.

56:10.020 --> 56:11.955
Don't let them see you
pull out a notebook.

56:12.022 --> 56:16.193
Tonight, it's
"Press: Forget about it."

56:16.260 --> 56:18.295
We'd have
to look to the Caesars

56:18.362 --> 56:22.566
and pharaohs to find men
with a scale of vision

56:22.633 --> 56:24.068
to compare with his.

56:24.134 --> 56:25.703
- A great man.
- If!

56:25.769 --> 56:27.237
A man of history,

56:27.304 --> 56:31.775
serving the people of
this city for over 25 years,

56:31.841 --> 56:34.678
Moses Randolph!

56:43.821 --> 56:46.623
Jeez, you'd think
Patton showed up.

56:46.690 --> 56:49.960
He pays one and a half times
union rate on all of his jobs.

56:50.027 --> 56:52.262
They'd pave over
their mothers for him.

56:53.497 --> 56:54.897
Thank you, Joe.

56:55.666 --> 56:58.168
Tonight, over 300 years

56:58.235 --> 57:00.437
since the founding
of this great city,

57:00.504 --> 57:04.208
we recommit ourselves
to the ancient truth

57:04.274 --> 57:06.477
that it is not knowledge,

57:06.543 --> 57:08.312
but action and enterprise

57:08.379 --> 57:12.516
which are the engine
and objective in life.

57:12.583 --> 57:14.418
Clever men come and go,

57:14.485 --> 57:18.188
but for every dozen of them
with their big ideas,

57:18.255 --> 57:21.058
there is not more than one
that can execute them.

57:21.891 --> 57:23.060
I look around this room,

57:23.127 --> 57:24.762
I don't see
a lot of bright boys

57:24.828 --> 57:28.565
or goodie-goodie progressives
with their paralyzing ideals.

57:31.135 --> 57:33.170
I see the men of my tribe.

57:34.138 --> 57:36.140
The men who get things done.

57:36.206 --> 57:38.908
The doers that make
this country great!

57:41.845 --> 57:43.747
To be honored by you

57:43.814 --> 57:47.951
is all the affirmation or
payment I shall ever seek.

57:48.952 --> 57:50.487
I celebrate you

57:51.388 --> 57:52.523
and I thank you.

57:52.589 --> 57:54.291
Hear, hear!

58:27.324 --> 58:28.559
I'll catch you
on the next one.

58:28.625 --> 58:29.626
All right.

59:01.492 --> 59:02.693
You finished it?

59:02.759 --> 59:04.495
Best work I've done.

59:04.561 --> 59:08.131
A total modernization of
the state's electrical grid.

59:08.198 --> 59:11.201
And it's a scale
that only you can get done.

59:16.473 --> 59:17.808
Clean yourself up,
for Christ sakes.

59:17.875 --> 59:19.409
How? With what?

59:19.476 --> 59:21.144
Hey, not a fuckin' word
out of you about any of that.

59:21.211 --> 59:22.479
You bring that up to me
ever again,

59:22.546 --> 59:23.747
I'm gonna close you out
for good.

59:23.814 --> 59:25.349
Moses, I'm so far out,

59:25.415 --> 59:27.885
I'm doing piecework
for kids fresh out of school.

59:27.952 --> 59:30.254
You whip up a crowd
against me like that ever again,

59:30.320 --> 59:31.622
I'm gonna take your big idea,

59:31.688 --> 59:33.056
I'll throw it
on the fuckin' scrap heap.

59:33.123 --> 59:35.125
- Is that what you want?
- No, no.

59:35.192 --> 59:37.728
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

59:37.794 --> 59:39.530
None of that matters.

59:39.596 --> 59:42.099
Just read it.

59:43.934 --> 59:45.235
I'll read it.

59:46.971 --> 59:49.506
<i>What makes a person
go against their own brother?</i>

59:50.641 --> 59:52.209
<i>All my life,
I'd never had a family,</i>

59:52.276 --> 59:53.810
<i>so I never could
understand people</i>

59:53.877 --> 59:56.346
<i>who did and let it get ugly.</i>

59:56.413 --> 01:00:00.317
<i>My crazy brain was tellin' me I
should keep pullin' on that thread,</i>

01:00:00.384 --> 01:00:01.718
<i>but whatever Frank found,</i>

01:00:01.785 --> 01:00:03.620
<i>he found it
following the girl.</i>

01:00:03.687 --> 01:00:06.290
<i>So, I just kept chasin'
his footsteps.</i>

01:01:03.914 --> 01:01:05.115
Hello?

01:01:07.085 --> 01:01:08.285
Hello?

01:01:36.546 --> 01:01:37.547
If!

01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:41.218
Keep it together, Freakshow.

01:01:48.859 --> 01:01:49.860
Jesus.

01:01:52.763 --> 01:01:54.765
- You lookin' for somethin'?
- Help, Bailey!

01:01:54.831 --> 01:01:56.100
Ah, shit.

01:01:56.166 --> 01:01:57.367
What, you think you can just
walk into people's homes?

01:01:57.434 --> 01:01:58.769
No, I was lookin' for someone.

01:01:58.835 --> 01:02:00.038
I didn't think
anybody lived here.

01:02:00.104 --> 01:02:01.204
Oh, someone lives here.

01:02:01.271 --> 01:02:02.439
- My momma lives here.
- Sure.

01:02:02.506 --> 01:02:04.207
- At least, she's tryin' to.
- If!

01:02:04.274 --> 01:02:05.509
Who you with?

01:02:05.575 --> 01:02:07.011
- Huh?
- I hope you're with Belmont.

01:02:07.078 --> 01:02:08.879
Yeah, yeah, Belmont.
Who else?

01:02:13.283 --> 01:02:14.584
What is going on?

01:02:14.651 --> 01:02:16.453
We got ourselves
an intruder.

01:02:17.989 --> 01:02:20.290
- How hard did you hit him?
- I barely tapped him.

01:02:20.357 --> 01:02:21.725
Fool slipped
and hit his own head.

01:02:21.792 --> 01:02:22.793
If!

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.595
"If" what?

01:02:25.662 --> 01:02:27.431
I'll tell you what, "if"...

01:02:27.497 --> 01:02:29.133
you better explain who you are

01:02:29.199 --> 01:02:30.734
if you want to
walk out of here.

01:02:32.335 --> 01:02:33.537
Have I seen you before?

01:02:33.603 --> 01:02:35.039
Yeah,
my name is Jake Gleason.

01:02:35.106 --> 01:02:36.140
It's a misunderstanding,
all right?

01:02:36.206 --> 01:02:37.741
I'm a reporter.

01:02:37.808 --> 01:02:40.410
I was at the Hamilton Housing
hearing the other night.

01:02:40.477 --> 01:02:42.046
I called the committee
this morning.

01:02:42.113 --> 01:02:43.880
I came out here
looking for you.

01:02:43.947 --> 01:02:46.483
He the one that said he's with
those racketeering sons of bitches.

01:02:46.550 --> 01:02:48.019
They stole her fridge.

01:02:48.086 --> 01:02:50.754
They stole her copper pipes.
Man, what you expect?

01:02:50.821 --> 01:02:53.390
First, they put up a notice says
the house will be condemned.

01:02:53.457 --> 01:02:55.225
It's not true,
but that scares out

01:02:55.292 --> 01:02:56.860
about half
and they sell for cheap.

01:02:56.927 --> 01:02:59.362
Then they come in and take
the nice old family homes,

01:02:59.429 --> 01:03:01.165
chop 'em into four
and rent 'em up.

01:03:01.231 --> 01:03:03.000
Folks who don't leave,
they harass,

01:03:03.067 --> 01:03:04.568
turn the heat off,

01:03:04.634 --> 01:03:06.770
come in to do repairs
and steal copper pipe instead.

01:03:06.837 --> 01:03:10.307
The city sold property worth
$15 million for 500,000

01:03:10.373 --> 01:03:13.243
to take the risk of having to
build the federal projects.

01:03:13.310 --> 01:03:14.845
They haven't even
submitted plans,

01:03:14.911 --> 01:03:16.913
just milked it
till it really is a slum.

01:03:16.981 --> 01:03:18.915
Slammer for the slum lords,
Bailey!

01:03:18.983 --> 01:03:20.484
- Ah...
- Oh, what?

01:03:20.550 --> 01:03:22.019
You're one of those who thinks
we're just agitating?

01:03:22.086 --> 01:03:24.421
Making it up like some
Negro propaganda conspiracy?

01:03:24.488 --> 01:03:26.356
No, no, look, look, look.
I got a condition, okay?

01:03:26.423 --> 01:03:29.526
It makes me say funny things,
but I'm not trying to be funny.

01:03:29.593 --> 01:03:30.995
I'm really not. I'm listenin'.

01:03:31.996 --> 01:03:33.296
Where's everybody go?

01:03:33.363 --> 01:03:37.101
Mostly just disappear.
Fade away.

01:03:37.168 --> 01:03:38.735
200,000 in two years,

01:03:38.802 --> 01:03:40.704
just from this part
of Brooklyn.

01:03:40.771 --> 01:03:43.007
- Mostly Negro. Latino.
- Yeah,

01:03:43.074 --> 01:03:44.841
but Horowitz said they did it
up in East Tremont, too.

01:03:44.908 --> 01:03:46.576
- Same thing?
- Yeah, they did it

01:03:46.643 --> 01:03:48.879
to a few Jews, too,
but not systematic like this.

01:03:48.945 --> 01:03:50.514
How many parks, do you think,
have been built

01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:52.549
in this city since
he's been commissioner?

01:03:52.616 --> 01:03:54.317
255.

01:03:54.384 --> 01:03:56.787
How many of those in Harlem,
you think?

01:03:57.621 --> 01:03:58.688
One.

01:03:58.755 --> 01:04:01.159
You build a new beach
for the people,

01:04:01.225 --> 01:04:02.459
but the ones with no cars,

01:04:02.526 --> 01:04:03.894
the poor ones,
the black and brown ones,

01:04:03.961 --> 01:04:06.130
how are they gonna get
to the parks and beaches?

01:04:06.197 --> 01:04:07.965
Public bus.

01:04:08.032 --> 01:04:11.768
Guess how high they just built
the overpasses on the new parkway?

01:04:11.835 --> 01:04:14.604
One foot too low
for a bus to clear.

01:04:14.671 --> 01:04:15.772
Come on.

01:04:15.839 --> 01:04:17.507
Look, forget whether
it's discrimination.

01:04:17.574 --> 01:04:19.110
The federal government and
the city are being scammed.

01:04:19.177 --> 01:04:21.378
There's supposed to be
relocation services,

01:04:21.444 --> 01:04:23.047
company's got
a $2 million contract

01:04:23.114 --> 01:04:25.348
to handle it, but nobody
even answers the phone.

01:04:25.415 --> 01:04:26.917
Call the city,
they say these folks

01:04:26.984 --> 01:04:28.585
are on the list for
the new public housing,

01:04:28.652 --> 01:04:29.954
- but then it never gets built.
- You know more

01:04:30.021 --> 01:04:31.555
than any secretary
I ever met in my life.

01:04:31.621 --> 01:04:34.258
Secretary? Who told you that?

01:04:34.324 --> 01:04:35.892
I got a law degree, you know?

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:38.229
I'll pass the bar
first time I sit, too.

01:04:38.296 --> 01:04:40.097
Okay, then. Sorry.

01:04:40.164 --> 01:04:41.698
How are you gonna write about it
all if you don't even take a note?

01:04:41.765 --> 01:04:43.500
What, "$2 million
for relocation services,

01:04:43.567 --> 01:04:45.069
bridges a foot too low
for the buses,

01:04:45.136 --> 01:04:46.570
one out of 255 parks,

01:04:46.636 --> 01:04:48.438
15 million in property
for 500K,

01:04:48.505 --> 01:04:51.675
200,000 people
in Fort Greene alone." That?

01:04:51.741 --> 01:04:53.543
I never forget anything,
believe me.

01:04:53.610 --> 01:04:55.046
Not a single word.

01:04:56.981 --> 01:04:59.951
I'm really sorry.
I can't help it, I got a...

01:05:00.017 --> 01:05:01.319
It's okay.

01:05:01.384 --> 01:05:04.055
Just write about it, please.

01:05:04.121 --> 01:05:05.722
What happens to poor people
in this city

01:05:05.789 --> 01:05:08.226
wasn't news yesterday
and it won't be tomorrow,

01:05:08.292 --> 01:05:11.528
but you'd think somebody'd
care what happens to Brooklyn.

01:05:11.595 --> 01:05:13.897
It's only the biggest city
on Earth.

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:17.934
Where you live?

01:05:19.203 --> 01:05:21.005
- Harlem.
- Hmm.

01:05:21.072 --> 01:05:23.007
This is me.

01:05:23.074 --> 01:05:24.741
You want me
to give you a ride?

01:05:26.344 --> 01:05:27.377
Come on,
the trains will be mobbed.

01:05:27.444 --> 01:05:28.645
I'll give you a ride.

01:05:29.913 --> 01:05:30.914
Come on.

01:06:01.945 --> 01:06:05.016
Bebop, Bailey, in the
Metropolitan Bopera House!

01:06:05.082 --> 01:06:06.816
Oh, God.

01:06:06.883 --> 01:06:09.353
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:06:09.419 --> 01:06:11.721
Don't be sorry.
It's kinda funny.

01:06:11.788 --> 01:06:15.825
Yeah? Well, hang around a little
while, and see what you think.

01:06:20.197 --> 01:06:21.198
If!

01:06:22.133 --> 01:06:23.700
What is all that, anyway?

01:06:23.767 --> 01:06:27.071
I don't know.
I never got a name for it.

01:06:27.138 --> 01:06:29.706
It's like a piece in my head broke
off and got a life of its own

01:06:29.773 --> 01:06:32.809
and then just decided to
keep joyridin' me for kicks.

01:06:33.443 --> 01:06:35.478
Kicks and tics!

01:06:35.545 --> 01:06:38.115
- Licks and tics!
- Sorry.

01:06:38.182 --> 01:06:39.482
It's okay.

01:06:39.549 --> 01:06:42.353
It's like living
with an anarchist, you know,

01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:46.257
but the funny thing is, it also has
to have everything in its right place.

01:06:46.324 --> 01:06:50.294
Like, things have to be ordered
and lined up just right.

01:06:50.361 --> 01:06:53.197
Everything has to sound
just right or else it really,

01:06:53.264 --> 01:06:55.899
it'll really put me into knots
until I fix it.

01:06:55.967 --> 01:06:58.369
Like, I'm talkin' to you
right now, right?

01:06:58.436 --> 01:06:59.836
But that part of my head,

01:06:59.903 --> 01:07:02.605
it's worryin' that the bills
in my wallet

01:07:02.672 --> 01:07:04.408
aren't lined up all in
the right sequence,

01:07:04.474 --> 01:07:05.942
and it's sayin',

01:07:06.010 --> 01:07:07.345
"Stop talkin' to this girl,
and deal with this."

01:07:07.411 --> 01:07:09.146
It's not fair.

01:07:09.213 --> 01:07:12.984
Hey, we all got
our daily battles, right?

01:07:14.751 --> 01:07:16.187
Yeah, fair enough.

01:07:20.724 --> 01:07:22.093
Kiss her face all night,
Bailey!

01:07:22.159 --> 01:07:25.029
Oh, God.

01:07:26.197 --> 01:07:27.365
I'm...

01:07:27.431 --> 01:07:28.732
- I really am sorry.
- It's okay.

01:07:28.798 --> 01:07:30.968
- I don't mean nothin' by it.
- Don't be sorry.

01:07:31.035 --> 01:07:32.702
It's okay.

01:07:55.658 --> 01:07:57.128
This is me.

01:07:57.194 --> 01:07:59.430
What, up from that?
That must keep you up nights.

01:07:59.497 --> 01:08:01.664
My father owns the place.

01:08:01.731 --> 01:08:04.934
I grew up falling asleep
in the back of clubs.

01:08:05.002 --> 01:08:06.971
It's pretty hoppin'
for a Monday night.

01:08:07.038 --> 01:08:09.240
Hottest band in the world,
all week.

01:08:10.607 --> 01:08:12.109
Listen...

01:08:12.176 --> 01:08:15.079
I gotta check
on one or two things,

01:08:15.146 --> 01:08:18.548
but are you really interested
in what I was telling you?

01:08:19.649 --> 01:08:22.752
Yeah, I came lookin' for you,
didn't I?

01:08:22.819 --> 01:08:25.755
If you wanna come in,
I could give you a lot more.

01:08:27.924 --> 01:08:31.261
I don't tend to do so good
in places like this.

01:08:31.328 --> 01:08:33.064
Come on, you can't exactly
disturb the peace

01:08:33.130 --> 01:08:35.332
in a small club
with a hot band.

01:08:37.301 --> 01:08:38.301
All right.

01:08:39.502 --> 01:08:41.171
It's your party.

01:08:48.678 --> 01:08:50.481
Keep an eye on it
for me, all right?

01:08:59.523 --> 01:09:00.790
Hey, Vance.

01:09:10.334 --> 01:09:11.969
Hey, you, out.

01:09:14.770 --> 01:09:16.173
- Hey, George.
- Hey, girl.

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:17.241
Welcome.

01:09:19.542 --> 01:09:20.877
I'll be right back.

01:09:21.979 --> 01:09:22.979
If!

01:09:24.482 --> 01:09:27.051
Excuse me? Sir?

01:09:27.118 --> 01:09:29.618
I'm sorry. Um...
I'm a player, too.

01:09:29.685 --> 01:09:30.955
And, you know what, man?

01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:33.256
I really, really admire
your tremolo.

01:09:33.323 --> 01:09:34.524
And I'm just curious,

01:09:34.591 --> 01:09:37.627
how did you develop
that tremolo?

01:09:37.694 --> 01:09:40.363
Suckin' off little
white boys like you.

01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:42.433
Get the fuck out of here.

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:44.969
So what?
Whitey White suck stick!

01:09:45.902 --> 01:09:47.636
"So what" is right.

01:10:03.753 --> 01:10:05.189
Listen to me. Listen!

01:10:05.256 --> 01:10:06.991
<i>How y'all doin' this evenin'?</i>

01:10:07.057 --> 01:10:08.492
<i>Feels good to be home
with friends and family.</i>

01:10:08.559 --> 01:10:10.194
<i>I been travelin' the world,</i>

01:10:11.428 --> 01:10:14.165
<i>learnin' new languages...</i>

01:10:14.231 --> 01:10:17.301
<i>and with new language
comes new ideas.</i>

01:10:17.368 --> 01:10:20.371
<i>So, we gonna try a few of them
on y'all tonight.</i>

01:10:20.437 --> 01:10:21.804
<i>Strap in.</i>

01:10:31.748 --> 01:10:33.050
If! Oh.

01:10:33.117 --> 01:10:34.985
You sure you don't wanna
sit in the back?

01:10:35.052 --> 01:10:36.287
Vance?

01:10:39.822 --> 01:10:41.425
Trumpet player's a jazzmatazz!

01:10:43.093 --> 01:10:46.330
Can we just sit in the back?
Let's sit in the back.

01:10:46.397 --> 01:10:47.730
No one cares.

01:10:58.542 --> 01:10:59.977
Ah!

01:11:01.579 --> 01:11:04.048
It's better 'cause I can
control what's on it.

01:11:04.114 --> 01:11:06.283
Okay, you need
to get out more.

01:11:11.155 --> 01:11:12.156
Oh!

01:11:29.607 --> 01:11:31.874
- You wanna get up there?
- No, I don't. I don't.

01:11:31.941 --> 01:11:34.211
It's causin' me problems.

01:11:56.667 --> 01:11:57.900
Don't put your hands on me.

01:11:57.968 --> 01:12:00.337
There she is,
my favorite baby girl,

01:12:00.404 --> 01:12:02.673
looking pretty as a rose.

01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:04.774
This next one's for you,
Laura.

01:12:30.734 --> 01:12:32.670
I don't think
I can do this. It's not...

01:12:32.736 --> 01:12:34.538
It's okay. It's okay.

01:12:38.875 --> 01:12:41.512
If!
It's not a good idea.

01:13:47.378 --> 01:13:48.512
Where is she?

01:14:41.064 --> 01:14:43.066
I'm just gonna deal
with something.

01:14:52.810 --> 01:14:54.011
What's goin' on?

01:14:54.077 --> 01:14:55.345
All right, y'all,
don't get too cozy.

01:14:55.412 --> 01:14:57.881
That was your last break.

01:15:12.362 --> 01:15:13.363
Oh!

01:15:15.065 --> 01:15:16.066
If!

01:15:32.082 --> 01:15:34.218
Oh! Hey!

01:15:34.284 --> 01:15:36.320
Hey, take it easy,
take it easy!

01:15:37.087 --> 01:15:39.256
Jesus, what'd I do?

01:15:40.824 --> 01:15:42.092
I said, let's go!

01:15:42.159 --> 01:15:43.293
Tell it
to the fuckin' judge!

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:44.461
Take it easy.

01:15:44.528 --> 01:15:47.030
- Shut up!
- Hey, I got this.

01:15:49.233 --> 01:15:51.134
You think I don't know
who you work for, cracker?

01:15:51.201 --> 01:15:52.569
Black cracker,
crack-whacker!

01:15:52.636 --> 01:15:54.404
Hey... I made it through
Iwo Jima, motherfucker!

01:15:54.471 --> 01:15:55.873
You think your boss scares me?

01:15:55.939 --> 01:15:57.341
Now you tell him that if I see

01:15:57.407 --> 01:15:58.675
any of you snoops
around her again,

01:15:58.742 --> 01:16:00.911
I will kill you off
one at a time,

01:16:00.979 --> 01:16:03.714
and I will mail what he's
lookin' for to the <i>Post</i> for free!

01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:06.483
Do you hear me?
I will mail it to the <i>Post!</i>

01:16:07.918 --> 01:16:09.119
Let's go.

01:16:11.221 --> 01:16:12.589
If!

01:16:12.656 --> 01:16:13.657
If!

01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:31.241
Meow, the tomcat!

01:16:32.075 --> 01:16:34.044
Scarlet, the scared cat!

01:16:41.285 --> 01:16:42.586
Trumpet, my man!

01:16:46.690 --> 01:16:47.824
Hep cat needs help!

01:16:48.825 --> 01:16:50.227
Help for the hep cat!

01:16:51.562 --> 01:16:53.931
You were pretty hep in there
tonight yourself, cat.

01:16:53.998 --> 01:16:55.098
Help!

01:16:55.165 --> 01:16:56.767
The hep cat needs help!

01:17:02.172 --> 01:17:03.373
If!

01:17:07.210 --> 01:17:09.780
What, your head need fixin',
too?

01:17:09.846 --> 01:17:11.214
- Yeah.
- Oh, whoa, whoa.

01:17:11.281 --> 01:17:14.018
Wait, now, this ain't
just no marijuana.

01:17:14.084 --> 01:17:15.485
It's all right.

01:17:48.819 --> 01:17:50.621
You remember what I said.

01:18:15.046 --> 01:18:16.313
Oh, God.

01:18:17.681 --> 01:18:18.682
Shit.

01:18:19.683 --> 01:18:21.385
Sorry.

01:18:21.451 --> 01:18:23.720
Sorry, I don't even know
what happened.

01:18:23.787 --> 01:18:25.856
You had a good time,
that's what happened.

01:18:26.890 --> 01:18:28.392
Had a little party.

01:18:28.458 --> 01:18:31.595
Different mix of people
than the usual.

01:18:31.662 --> 01:18:35.532
She called it
a <i>étrange mélange.</i>

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:37.901
Thought you could
use some rest,

01:18:37.969 --> 01:18:40.470
so we just let you be.

01:18:40.537 --> 01:18:42.006
Oh!

01:18:42.073 --> 01:18:43.373
Yeah.

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:44.641
That guy left his footprint
on my ribs,

01:18:44.708 --> 01:18:46.309
I remember that part.

01:18:46.376 --> 01:18:48.211
Thanks for bailin' me
out of there.

01:18:48.278 --> 01:18:50.714
Sarge is a good man,

01:18:50.781 --> 01:18:53.450
but you gotta watch how you
are around a man's family,

01:18:53.517 --> 01:18:54.785
you know what I'm sayin'?

01:18:54.851 --> 01:18:55.852
Who's Sarge?

01:18:55.919 --> 01:18:57.989
- Billy.
- Why you call him "Sarge"?

01:18:58.056 --> 01:19:00.457
You don't know how he got
his arm all fucked up?

01:19:00.524 --> 01:19:02.693
- Mmm-mmm.
- Colored Marine Unit,

01:19:02.759 --> 01:19:03.794
carryin' ammo,

01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:05.362
and one day,
he picked up a gun

01:19:05.429 --> 01:19:08.699
tryin' to stop a Jap
suicide attack, got hit.

01:19:08.765 --> 01:19:11.535
Came back from that war
bitter as hell.

01:19:11.601 --> 01:19:13.904
Damn shame, too,
'cause he could play.

01:19:14.805 --> 01:19:15.739
Trombone.

01:19:15.806 --> 01:19:17.407
- Hmm.
- He used to jam with us

01:19:17.474 --> 01:19:19.876
down at Minton's
back in the '40s.

01:19:21.012 --> 01:19:23.147
You ever met his wife?

01:19:23.213 --> 01:19:24.614
Sarge ain't never married.

01:19:24.681 --> 01:19:26.184
What about Laura's mother?

01:19:26.249 --> 01:19:28.186
I don't know nothin'
about that.

01:19:28.251 --> 01:19:30.088
It was just Laura and him.

01:19:30.154 --> 01:19:31.855
She was a tiny little thing,

01:19:31.922 --> 01:19:34.891
always in the kitchen,
readin' while we was playin'.

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:37.661
You play?

01:19:37.728 --> 01:19:40.263
- Music? No.
- Now, I'm not so keen

01:19:40.330 --> 01:19:42.833
on people bein' vocal
while we playin'...

01:19:44.168 --> 01:19:46.137
but you was on the line.

01:19:46.204 --> 01:19:47.537
I could hear it.

01:19:47.604 --> 01:19:49.974
On the line, Lionel.
Lionel's on the line.

01:19:50.041 --> 01:19:51.808
Sorry, I...

01:19:51.875 --> 01:19:54.811
I got somethin' wrong
with my head...

01:19:54.878 --> 01:19:58.248
and the music really, really
set it off. I'm sorry.

01:19:58.315 --> 01:19:59.649
Don't be sorry.

01:19:59.716 --> 01:20:02.153
You got a head
just like mine,

01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:04.821
always boilin' over.

01:20:04.888 --> 01:20:06.690
Turnin' things around.

01:20:07.891 --> 01:20:08.892
But that's music.

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:11.095
Controls you
more than you control it,

01:20:11.162 --> 01:20:12.496
once it gets in you.

01:20:12.562 --> 01:20:13.897
Some people call it a gift,

01:20:13.965 --> 01:20:15.866
but it's a brain affliction
just the same.

01:20:15.932 --> 01:20:17.801
Yeah, well,
I just twitch and shout.

01:20:17.868 --> 01:20:20.238
At least you got a horn
to push it through,

01:20:20.303 --> 01:20:22.039
make it sound pretty.

01:20:22.106 --> 01:20:25.176
Yeah, but there's a lot of
other hours in the day, though.

01:20:25.243 --> 01:20:26.943
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:20:27.011 --> 01:20:28.478
Too many.

01:20:37.387 --> 01:20:38.855
Look, thanks
for helpin' me out.

01:20:38.922 --> 01:20:41.591
You ever need anything,
you give me a call.

01:20:49.133 --> 01:20:50.801
Excuse me.

01:20:50.867 --> 01:20:52.236
Miss Horowitz...

01:20:52.302 --> 01:20:53.937
- Jake Gleason with the <i>Post...</i>
- You're not Jake Gleason.

01:20:54.005 --> 01:20:55.939
- I know Jake Gleason.
- Jake Gleason

01:20:56.007 --> 01:20:57.741
took me to the Hamilton
hearing the other night.

01:20:57.808 --> 01:20:59.509
- I heard you speak.
- Oh.

01:20:59.576 --> 01:21:01.611
I'm a new writer
with the <i>Times.</i>

01:21:01.678 --> 01:21:04.848
I got a very illuminating tour
from your aide, Laura Rose.

01:21:04.915 --> 01:21:07.450
She showed me everything
that's goin' on in Fort Greene.

01:21:07.517 --> 01:21:09.153
I'm very interested
in this story.

01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:11.454
Really? I thought that
the <i>Times</i> was more interested

01:21:11.521 --> 01:21:13.057
in being the press office
for the BA.

01:21:13.124 --> 01:21:15.059
I'm not saying
I can make it A1 tomorrow,

01:21:15.126 --> 01:21:16.626
but if I don't get some help
on the legwork,

01:21:16.693 --> 01:21:18.129
how can I try, right?

01:21:18.196 --> 01:21:20.097
Well, someone's gonna win
a Pulitzer off that story.

01:21:20.164 --> 01:21:21.498
Maybe it'll be you.

01:21:21.565 --> 01:21:23.333
If!
Sorry.

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:26.270
She's already gone ahead
to the protest.

01:21:26.336 --> 01:21:28.005
You wanna come with me?

01:21:28.072 --> 01:21:30.473
I want
you to hear this next speaker

01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:32.276
and listen
to what she has to say.

01:21:32.342 --> 01:21:33.877
She has taught me more about

01:21:33.944 --> 01:21:35.512
fightin' the good fight
than anyone else.

01:21:35.579 --> 01:21:37.181
Look, I brought
<i>The New York Times.</i>

01:21:37.248 --> 01:21:39.449
She wears granny
glasses, but don't be fooled!

01:21:40.717 --> 01:21:43.653
She is a pit bull
for the people!

01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:46.656
And let me just say this,
let me just say this...

01:21:46.723 --> 01:21:49.327
I want you to hear this.

01:21:49.392 --> 01:21:52.096
- Let's not mince words.
- No!

01:21:52.163 --> 01:21:54.364
'Cause we are livin' in a time

01:21:54.431 --> 01:21:57.467
that calls for naming things
as they are.

01:21:57.534 --> 01:21:58.768
Yes!

01:21:58.835 --> 01:22:02.505
This is not a program
for slum removal.

01:22:02.572 --> 01:22:03.740
No!

01:22:03.807 --> 01:22:07.211
This is a program
for Negro removal!

01:22:07.278 --> 01:22:08.445
Yeah!

01:22:08.511 --> 01:22:09.779
And we're not
gonna accept that!

01:22:09.846 --> 01:22:10.914
No!

01:22:10.982 --> 01:22:13.284
Ladies and gentlemen,
Gabby Horowitz!

01:22:17.754 --> 01:22:19.389
What is a city?

01:22:19.456 --> 01:22:21.491
Is it a place
where people slave

01:22:21.558 --> 01:22:24.161
for the lords
of steel and concrete?

01:22:24.228 --> 01:22:25.729
No!

01:22:25.795 --> 01:22:29.267
A corral for the druids of
finance to fleece mankind in?

01:22:29.333 --> 01:22:30.368
No!

01:22:30.433 --> 01:22:32.569
A city is its people!

01:22:32.636 --> 01:22:33.870
Yeah!

01:22:33.937 --> 01:22:37.308
- It is its community!
- Yeah!

01:22:37.375 --> 01:22:39.509
Who's gonna stand up
for the city?

01:22:39.576 --> 01:22:40.877
We are!

01:22:40.944 --> 01:22:42.812
Who's going to remind
the politicians

01:22:42.879 --> 01:22:45.216
and the power brokers
and the profiteers,

01:22:45.283 --> 01:22:49.987
that the city belongs to
the people who live in it?

01:22:51.222 --> 01:22:54.891
Mo must go! Mo must go!

01:22:54.959 --> 01:22:57.861
I've never seen such horseshit
in my life.

01:22:57.928 --> 01:23:01.165
Mo must go!
Mo must go!

01:23:01.232 --> 01:23:04.135
We may have an issue
with our friend from Brooklyn.

01:23:04.201 --> 01:23:05.468
He's asserting himself.

01:23:05.535 --> 01:23:06.803
How so?

01:23:06.870 --> 01:23:08.372
Well, he's not here
for this <i>mishigas.</i>

01:23:08.438 --> 01:23:09.839
He's not that brave,

01:23:09.906 --> 01:23:11.142
but he still might not
go along with the vote.

01:23:11.208 --> 01:23:12.609
Says his constituency
is up in arms.

01:23:12.676 --> 01:23:14.011
We made him
the borough president.

01:23:14.078 --> 01:23:15.679
We put him
on the Board of Estimate.

01:23:15.745 --> 01:23:16.947
We're his constituency.

01:23:17.014 --> 01:23:18.848
Don't tell me
he's not gonna go along.

01:23:19.951 --> 01:23:21.152
Hey...

01:23:21.218 --> 01:23:24.487
I'm gonna hand him this
the day before the vote.

01:23:25.122 --> 01:23:26.123
He'll go along.

01:23:27.524 --> 01:23:28.892
He's a louse.

01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:32.196
Mo must go! Mo must go!

01:23:38.402 --> 01:23:39.769
Let's go have lunch.

01:23:41.372 --> 01:23:42.572
Jake?

01:23:43.441 --> 01:23:44.808
Hey, Jake!

01:23:45.842 --> 01:23:47.345
Ah,
it's the disappearing lady.

01:23:47.411 --> 01:23:48.945
I'm so sorry. I owe you an...

01:23:49.013 --> 01:23:50.547
Oh, you don't owe me nothin'.
I'm used to it.

01:23:50.613 --> 01:23:52.682
No, no,
I tried to find you. I...

01:23:52.749 --> 01:23:54.784
- I want to explain...
- Laura!

01:23:54.851 --> 01:23:56.320
You gotta go. It's all right.

01:23:56.387 --> 01:23:57.754
Yeah, listen, I...

01:23:57.821 --> 01:23:59.090
I'll be at the club tonight.

01:23:59.656 --> 01:24:01.192
Come find me.

01:24:01.258 --> 01:24:02.826
- I'll, uh, I'll see if I can.
- Laura, come on!

01:24:04.128 --> 01:24:05.129
Come.

01:24:09.166 --> 01:24:10.267
Hey, hey, hold up.

01:24:10.334 --> 01:24:12.003
The reporter
that never reports.

01:24:12.069 --> 01:24:13.870
Do I gotta write it for you?
Jesus.

01:24:13.937 --> 01:24:15.172
You're not too ambitious,
are you?

01:24:15.239 --> 01:24:16.906
I'm still puttin'
the details together.

01:24:16.974 --> 01:24:19.143
- Tell me somethin'.
- Here's your next headline...

01:24:19.210 --> 01:24:20.543
"New expressway

01:24:20.610 --> 01:24:22.645
will be the world's
biggest parking lot."

01:24:22.712 --> 01:24:24.948
- What? Why?
- Because cars are a cancer

01:24:25.016 --> 01:24:27.284
and roads make them
metastasize,

01:24:27.351 --> 01:24:28.685
not shrink. We need trains.

01:24:28.752 --> 01:24:30.787
- But he's killin' the trains.
- Why?

01:24:30.854 --> 01:24:33.391
Always with the "why."
Because he doesn't control

01:24:33.457 --> 01:24:34.891
the revenues from the trains.

01:24:34.959 --> 01:24:38.262
He controls the tolls
for the bridges and roads.

01:24:38.329 --> 01:24:39.497
Borough Authority.

01:24:39.562 --> 01:24:40.630
You know
what an "Authority" is?

01:24:40.697 --> 01:24:42.400
- No.
- Neither did anyone else.

01:24:42.466 --> 01:24:45.469
He invented it.
A fourth branch of government.

01:24:45.535 --> 01:24:46.669
A shadow branch.

01:24:46.736 --> 01:24:47.937
All controlled by him,

01:24:48.005 --> 01:24:49.473
meaning he controls
everything,

01:24:49.539 --> 01:24:52.143
but nobody voted for him,
and they can't vote him out.

01:24:52.209 --> 01:24:54.345
Wait, wait, wait.
What could stop him?

01:24:54.412 --> 01:24:55.612
Almost nothing.

01:24:55.678 --> 01:24:56.579
And he's more dangerous now
than ever.

01:24:56.646 --> 01:24:57.881
Why now?

01:24:57.947 --> 01:24:59.450
'Cause
the Board of Estimate

01:24:59.517 --> 01:25:01.252
votes on his highway and slum
clearance plans this week,

01:25:01.318 --> 01:25:03.354
so he's bullyin' everyone
into submission!

01:25:03.421 --> 01:25:06.457
He's the most powerful man
in the history of the city!

01:25:06.524 --> 01:25:09.626
He's an autocratic Caesar,
but nobody realizes it.

01:25:09.692 --> 01:25:11.828
They are just
all walking around,

01:25:11.895 --> 01:25:13.464
calm as Hindu cows,

01:25:13.531 --> 01:25:14.798
thinking they live
in a democracy,

01:25:14.864 --> 01:25:16.167
so what could happen?

01:25:16.233 --> 01:25:17.435
Are you gonna write
about this or what?

01:25:17.501 --> 01:25:18.735
If you know so much about him,

01:25:18.802 --> 01:25:20.538
why haven't you
taken him down?

01:25:20.603 --> 01:25:21.805
Because it can't be me.

01:25:21.871 --> 01:25:23.640
No, 'cause you're his brother.

01:25:27.644 --> 01:25:30.981
No, because I still
have dreams.

01:25:31.581 --> 01:25:32.916
That's why.

01:25:32.983 --> 01:25:35.119
Dreams that I am this close
to realizing.

01:25:35.186 --> 01:25:38.422
It's my contribution
to society.

01:25:38.489 --> 01:25:40.291
My legacy!

01:25:40.357 --> 01:25:41.658
I'm...

01:25:41.724 --> 01:25:43.294
I'm not gonna risk it.

01:25:44.495 --> 01:25:45.996
All right.

01:25:48.265 --> 01:25:51.368
Okay, here...

01:25:51.435 --> 01:25:56.173
look at Belmont Developers
and Inwood Residential.

01:25:56.706 --> 01:25:58.008
What's all that?

01:25:58.075 --> 01:25:59.642
Oh, God, I'm givin' the goods.

01:25:59.709 --> 01:26:02.346
A map to the scoop
of the decade!

01:26:02.413 --> 01:26:04.381
Do your damn job!

01:26:04.448 --> 01:26:05.715
Do the job!

01:26:05.782 --> 01:26:08.085
I got enough problems.

01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:12.689
Records Office.

01:26:12.755 --> 01:26:14.592
Sorry, I'll need to
see your identification

01:26:14.657 --> 01:26:15.859
and have you
sign into the log.

01:26:15.925 --> 01:26:17.394
I'm just gonna read it
right here, pal.

01:26:17.461 --> 01:26:18.628
I'm not checkin' it out.

01:26:18.695 --> 01:26:20.197
See, parties wishing to review

01:26:20.264 --> 01:26:21.966
incorporation materials
of city contractors need to

01:26:22.032 --> 01:26:24.201
register with the construction
commissioner's office.

01:26:24.268 --> 01:26:25.735
That can't be legal.

01:26:25.802 --> 01:26:28.272
Not really a law,
more of a rule, Mister...

01:26:28.339 --> 01:26:29.739
Gleason.

01:27:01.671 --> 01:27:03.274
- Good evening.
- Hey...

01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:05.875
so I can get my housing
relocation forms here, yeah?

01:27:05.942 --> 01:27:07.411
Yeah, just there.

01:27:07.478 --> 01:27:08.811
And you can mail those in?

01:27:08.878 --> 01:27:11.482
Uh, in-person relocation
applications only.

01:27:11.549 --> 01:27:13.951
- Over there.
- Oh.

01:27:14.018 --> 01:27:17.720
So, they left you runnin' this whole
operation by yourself, did they?

01:27:17.787 --> 01:27:19.323
Mmm, they did, indeed.

01:27:19.390 --> 01:27:21.125
Big tits!

01:27:21.192 --> 01:27:23.194
Bless you.

01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:25.429
You have a good evening.
Thanks for your help.

01:27:26.263 --> 01:27:27.264
Wait, your form!

01:28:11.908 --> 01:28:14.378
People's trash
remains private property

01:28:14.445 --> 01:28:16.180
until it's been collected.

01:28:16.247 --> 01:28:18.115
Didn't anybody
ever tell you that?

01:28:18.815 --> 01:28:20.050
Wait a minute.

01:28:20.117 --> 01:28:22.519
We've seen each other before,
ain't we?

01:28:22.586 --> 01:28:24.021
Ain't we seen him?

01:28:24.088 --> 01:28:26.490
Yeah, we seen him.

01:28:26.557 --> 01:28:28.659
You keep stickin' your nose
in people's trash,

01:28:28.726 --> 01:28:30.427
and we're gonna see you again.

01:28:35.466 --> 01:28:37.601
Giant,
faggot munchkin meat!

01:28:37.668 --> 01:28:39.536
Oh. Okay.

01:28:41.472 --> 01:28:42.805
See...

01:28:42.872 --> 01:28:46.176
I was told to go easy,
and I did...

01:28:46.243 --> 01:28:50.080
and now, you gotta go
and make me do this!

01:28:50.147 --> 01:28:51.282
They're not even pretending,

01:28:51.348 --> 01:28:52.983
they're just collecting
the checks

01:28:53.050 --> 01:28:54.385
and throwing these people's
lives in the trash.

01:28:54.451 --> 01:28:55.953
These guys make Tammany

01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:57.655
look like Double-A ball,
I'm tellin' you.

01:28:57.721 --> 01:28:59.356
People make deals
with politicians

01:28:59.423 --> 01:29:01.358
for contracts all the time.
All right?

01:29:01.425 --> 01:29:02.925
Kickin' it up the chain.
It's the nature of the thing.

01:29:02.993 --> 01:29:04.695
They're not makin' deals
with people,

01:29:04.762 --> 01:29:06.063
they're makin' deals
with themselves!

01:29:06.130 --> 01:29:07.531
They own the companies,

01:29:07.598 --> 01:29:08.999
they're given contracts
through it and kickbacks.

01:29:09.066 --> 01:29:10.334
It's grand larceny.

01:29:10.401 --> 01:29:11.602
Land a farce on me!

01:29:11.669 --> 01:29:12.970
- Calm down.
- Don't fart on my land, man!

01:29:13.037 --> 01:29:14.305
You got any weed?
Give him a smoke.

01:29:14.371 --> 01:29:15.739
Minna said it was
the biggest gravy train

01:29:15.805 --> 01:29:17.074
of the century, and he said...

01:29:17.141 --> 01:29:18.642
And this all goes down
in two days.

01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:21.412
So, it's big stuff, but how's
Frank mixed up in it?

01:29:21.478 --> 01:29:22.912
Every officer
of the Borough Authority

01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:24.248
is gonna make millions
on this deal,

01:29:24.315 --> 01:29:25.983
- but none of it ties to him.
- To Frank?

01:29:26.050 --> 01:29:27.817
- To Randolph.
- The parks commissioner?

01:29:27.884 --> 01:29:29.053
Yeah, Moses Randolph.

01:29:29.119 --> 01:29:30.287
He's behind everything.

01:29:30.354 --> 01:29:32.156
He's the one
who controls it all.

01:29:32.222 --> 01:29:34.091
Okay, listen, the girl had
the line on the scam, right?

01:29:34.158 --> 01:29:35.858
She was the one diggin'
into all these companies

01:29:35.925 --> 01:29:37.194
for the committee
and Horowitz.

01:29:37.261 --> 01:29:38.562
I think she found something

01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:40.497
that ties Randolph
straight to the money.

01:29:40.564 --> 01:29:42.633
Frank was followin' her,
and he figured it out,

01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:43.933
and he took it in to Lieberman
and his goons,

01:29:44.001 --> 01:29:45.202
and he showed them,

01:29:45.269 --> 01:29:46.704
he had his signature
on somethin'.

01:29:46.770 --> 01:29:50.341
I think Frank had somethin'
that nails Randolph.

01:29:52.909 --> 01:29:54.778
Come on! Come on!

01:29:54.877 --> 01:29:56.146
Where did...
Where did we lose 'em?

01:29:56.213 --> 01:29:58.015
- On the bridge.
- On the Borough Bridge.

01:29:58.082 --> 01:29:59.483
Those guys were
Borough Authority!

01:29:59.550 --> 01:30:01.552
The Borough Authority
killed Frank!

01:30:01.618 --> 01:30:02.953
Fuckin' Lionel.

01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:04.921
I think you're really
on the sniff, I do.

01:30:04.988 --> 01:30:06.123
All right, but one thing,
what's the angle

01:30:06.190 --> 01:30:07.791
on this other guy
with the club?

01:30:07.857 --> 01:30:10.294
Her father? The fuck was Frank
talkin' to him about?

01:30:10.361 --> 01:30:12.463
I don't know. That part,
I haven't figured out.

01:30:12.529 --> 01:30:15.466
It doesn't make any sense,
but he knows somethin'.

01:30:15.532 --> 01:30:16.967
He knows somethin'.

01:30:17.034 --> 01:30:18.369
All right, go home.

01:30:19.503 --> 01:30:21.171
I'm gonna make some calls
around town.

01:30:21.238 --> 01:30:23.507
Wait, who? What?
Who you gonna call?

01:30:23.574 --> 01:30:26.043
Would you just trust me,
and let me run with it?

01:30:31.782 --> 01:30:33.250
<i>Frank was
the only person I knew</i>

01:30:33.317 --> 01:30:34.685
<i>who thought
the way we won the war</i>

01:30:34.752 --> 01:30:37.020
<i>was gonna cause us problems.</i>

01:30:37.087 --> 01:30:38.589
<i>He said, after the Crash,
we were diggin'</i>

01:30:38.655 --> 01:30:41.158
<i>ourselves out
by taking care of each other.</i>

01:30:41.225 --> 01:30:42.593
<i>Now that we'd seen
what we could do</i>

01:30:42.659 --> 01:30:43.926
<i>with our brute strength,</i>

01:30:43.994 --> 01:30:45.763
<i>there was no goin' back.</i>

01:30:45.829 --> 01:30:47.464
<i>He said, from here on out,</i>

01:30:47.531 --> 01:30:50.100
<i>the game's gonna be about
power from top to bottom.</i>

01:31:02.613 --> 01:31:03.913
Yeah?

01:31:03.981 --> 01:31:05.416
<i>I know who you are.</i>

01:31:05.482 --> 01:31:06.350
Who's this?

01:31:06.417 --> 01:31:08.719
<i>You're one of Minna's boys.</i>

01:31:08.786 --> 01:31:09.887
Who's Minna?

01:31:09.953 --> 01:31:11.488
<i>Don't bullshit me.</i>

01:31:11.555 --> 01:31:13.357
<i>You gave your number
to the man with the horn.</i>

01:31:13.424 --> 01:31:15.025
<i>Sorry about roughin' you up.</i>

01:31:15.092 --> 01:31:16.926
<i>I thought
you was one of 'em BA goons.</i>

01:31:16.994 --> 01:31:19.196
Yeah, okay. So, what?

01:31:19.263 --> 01:31:20.930
<i>Where's the envelope?</i>

01:31:21.899 --> 01:31:23.700
I don't know. What's in it?

01:31:23.767 --> 01:31:25.702
<i>Hold on.</i>

01:31:25.769 --> 01:31:28.071
<i>Look, we can't talk
about it like this.</i>

01:31:28.138 --> 01:31:29.939
<i>It's too complicated.</i>

01:31:30.007 --> 01:31:31.442
<i>Meet me up at the club.</i>

01:31:31.508 --> 01:31:33.677
<i>Park up the block
and come in the back.</i>

01:31:33.744 --> 01:31:34.845
<i>I'll let you in there.</i>

01:31:34.912 --> 01:31:37.047
- What, now?
- <i>Yeah, now.</i>

01:31:38.482 --> 01:31:39.483
Okay.

01:32:14.151 --> 01:32:15.352
Billy?

01:32:23.527 --> 01:32:24.528
Hey.

01:32:32.469 --> 01:32:33.470
Billy.

01:32:41.512 --> 01:32:42.646
Shit.

01:32:49.586 --> 01:32:50.654
Son of a...

01:32:59.062 --> 01:33:01.365
All right, so, uh,
he told you to come,

01:33:01.431 --> 01:33:03.567
then he bumped himself
so you could find him

01:33:03.634 --> 01:33:05.135
before the staff came,
probably.

01:33:05.202 --> 01:33:06.703
No, I told you,
I didn't just find him,

01:33:06.770 --> 01:33:08.205
I heard it happen, okay?

01:33:08.272 --> 01:33:10.240
He didn't shoot himself...
Shoot my shit, Bailey!

01:33:10.307 --> 01:33:11.808
Sorry. Look,
someone else did this.

01:33:11.875 --> 01:33:13.343
They tried to make it look
like he did it to himself,

01:33:13.410 --> 01:33:14.645
but I heard 'em leave.

01:33:14.711 --> 01:33:16.413
Okay, we got powder burns
on the shirt,

01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:18.482
point-blank, neighbors saying
he got money problems.

01:33:18.549 --> 01:33:19.816
Seems pretty straightforward,
my friend.

01:33:19.883 --> 01:33:21.818
The gun was in his right hand.

01:33:21.885 --> 01:33:23.086
So?

01:33:23.153 --> 01:33:24.254
His right arm
is like a dead fish.

01:33:24.321 --> 01:33:26.156
He has a war wound, ace, okay?

01:33:26.223 --> 01:33:28.325
He couldn't lift a Zippo,
let alone a .38.

01:33:28.392 --> 01:33:30.093
So, explain to me,
how'd he shoot himself

01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:31.328
in the heart
with his left hand

01:33:31.395 --> 01:33:32.663
and then hand it off
to his right

01:33:32.729 --> 01:33:33.730
before he punched out?

01:33:35.098 --> 01:33:36.633
Look, guy went out on

01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:38.702
his own joint's center stage
with the lights and all...

01:33:38.769 --> 01:33:42.139
Gotta give him credit,
give him respect.

01:33:42.205 --> 01:33:46.209
They usually send Division dicks up
to Harlem at 3:00 a.m. for a suicide?

01:33:46.276 --> 01:33:47.844
We go wherever we're needed.

01:33:49.212 --> 01:33:50.480
Can I go now?

01:33:50.547 --> 01:33:51.548
Yeah.

01:33:52.951 --> 01:33:54.084
Oh, no!

01:33:54.151 --> 01:33:56.620
- No, no, no.
- No, no!

01:34:31.388 --> 01:34:34.458
I can't remember the last time
I saw him smile,

01:34:36.094 --> 01:34:37.794
but why would he do that?

01:34:39.196 --> 01:34:41.498
- To himself?
- He... He didn't.

01:34:41.565 --> 01:34:44.167
He didn't. Someone killed him.

01:34:44.234 --> 01:34:45.569
What?

01:34:45.636 --> 01:34:48.138
They tried to make it
look like he did it,

01:34:48.205 --> 01:34:49.473
but someone killed him.

01:34:50.941 --> 01:34:53.710
No, no, nobody hated him
like that. No one.

01:34:53.777 --> 01:34:55.145
I promise you,
I'm tellin' you the truth.

01:34:55.212 --> 01:34:56.680
Who would do something
like that?

01:34:56.747 --> 01:34:58.682
The same people that did it
to a friend of mine.

01:35:00.651 --> 01:35:03.654
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

01:35:04.788 --> 01:35:07.257
You got someone
that you can call?

01:35:10.128 --> 01:35:11.528
You all alone?

01:35:14.398 --> 01:35:16.166
You got no idea.

01:35:20.237 --> 01:35:21.605
It's okay.

01:35:29.613 --> 01:35:32.716
Can you stay with me a while?

01:35:35.086 --> 01:35:36.620
You want me to?

01:35:51.234 --> 01:35:52.235
If!

01:35:52.302 --> 01:35:54.038
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

01:35:54.105 --> 01:35:55.305
- It's okay.
- Shit.

01:35:56.773 --> 01:35:57.774
I'm...

01:35:58.976 --> 01:36:00.277
I'm sorry. I...

01:36:00.343 --> 01:36:01.545
- I don't know what happened.
- It's okay.

01:36:01.611 --> 01:36:03.447
- You fell asleep.
- It's okay.

01:36:06.483 --> 01:36:08.285
Thank you for staying.

01:36:09.686 --> 01:36:10.821
Yeah, sure.

01:36:16.693 --> 01:36:18.795
I know how you're feelin'.
I really do.

01:36:21.565 --> 01:36:24.901
Pretty soon, you're gonna hear
his voice in your head.

01:36:24.969 --> 01:36:26.837
He's gonna tell you
to pull yourself together

01:36:26.903 --> 01:36:27.972
and get movin'.

01:36:29.439 --> 01:36:30.975
And when you do,

01:36:31.042 --> 01:36:33.177
you're gonna feel him smilin'
at you again, I promise.

01:36:42.452 --> 01:36:44.421
I really am sorry.

01:36:49.593 --> 01:36:52.462
Why are you being
so nice to me?

01:36:53.797 --> 01:36:56.033
Because I think
you're a good person.

01:36:57.901 --> 01:36:59.636
You're tryin'
to make a difference.

01:36:59.703 --> 01:37:01.838
You actually care about
what happens to other people.

01:37:01.905 --> 01:37:03.340
I just...

01:37:03.406 --> 01:37:05.442
Not many people can say that.

01:37:06.510 --> 01:37:08.378
It's a good way to be.

01:37:12.183 --> 01:37:13.383
You're sweet.

01:37:16.954 --> 01:37:18.421
I don't think
that's how most people

01:37:18.488 --> 01:37:19.723
usually describe me
when they meet me,

01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:21.225
but I'm glad
that you think so.

01:37:25.029 --> 01:37:29.066
Anybody ever tell you
you talk in your sleep?

01:37:32.170 --> 01:37:34.604
Um, I never slept
with anyone.

01:37:36.506 --> 01:37:39.576
You never slept with anyone?

01:37:39.643 --> 01:37:42.980
I mean, I've been with
a few girls, but just not...

01:37:45.482 --> 01:37:48.718
not the kind who wanna stay
and sleep with me.

01:37:54.357 --> 01:37:55.759
Who's Frank?

01:37:59.863 --> 01:38:01.398
What?

01:38:01.464 --> 01:38:03.867
You said that name
when you were asleep.

01:38:03.934 --> 01:38:05.702
You seemed upset.

01:38:06.503 --> 01:38:08.405
Was he your friend who...

01:38:08.471 --> 01:38:09.806
Yeah, I...

01:38:10.607 --> 01:38:12.143
I worked with him, I...

01:38:12.210 --> 01:38:16.047
I worked for him,
but I met him when I was 12.

01:38:16.113 --> 01:38:20.318
I was at that Catholic home
for boys on DeKalb.

01:38:20.383 --> 01:38:22.019
They threw me in there
when I was six,

01:38:22.086 --> 01:38:23.520
after my mother died.

01:38:24.721 --> 01:38:26.556
Frank...

01:38:26.623 --> 01:38:30.493
Frank kind of took me
under his wing.

01:38:32.929 --> 01:38:34.898
You know, he never
called me my name.

01:38:36.334 --> 01:38:37.834
He called me Brooklyn.

01:38:39.070 --> 01:38:40.871
Say, "Look at you,
Motherless Brooklyn,

01:38:40.937 --> 01:38:43.640
you got no one
lookin' out for ya."

01:38:45.876 --> 01:38:48.079
We all need someone
lookin' out for us.

01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:12.402
Is that your mother?

01:39:12.469 --> 01:39:14.571
She's beautiful.

01:39:14.638 --> 01:39:16.840
She died
a long time ago.

01:39:18.541 --> 01:39:20.144
I don't remember her.

01:39:22.512 --> 01:39:25.383
I guess we both
got nobody now.

01:39:25.448 --> 01:39:27.450
Listen, I gotta ask you,

01:39:27.517 --> 01:39:29.153
is there something
you're not tellin' me?

01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:30.720
What?

01:39:30.787 --> 01:39:32.189
Is there something you're
holdin' out, you and Horowitz?

01:39:32.256 --> 01:39:33.890
On all this housing deal?

01:39:35.192 --> 01:39:36.394
Look, the...

01:39:36.459 --> 01:39:37.661
Those goons at the BA,

01:39:37.727 --> 01:39:38.862
they're scared of something,
okay?

01:39:38.929 --> 01:39:40.998
There's something big
out there

01:39:41.065 --> 01:39:42.400
that has to do
with all this fraud

01:39:42.465 --> 01:39:43.800
that you've been
diggin' around in.

01:39:43.867 --> 01:39:46.436
I think it ties it right up
to Moses Randolph.

01:39:46.503 --> 01:39:48.139
Do you know what it is?

01:39:48.205 --> 01:39:50.308
No, no, I mean,

01:39:50.374 --> 01:39:53.677
somebody's getting rich,
but no.

01:39:54.878 --> 01:39:56.080
You gotta take this seriously.

01:39:56.147 --> 01:39:57.547
If you're holdin' on
to some card

01:39:57.614 --> 01:39:58.615
and you're waitin' to play it

01:39:58.682 --> 01:39:59.783
to try to block that vote,

01:39:59.849 --> 01:40:01.584
you're playin'
a dangerous game.

01:40:01.651 --> 01:40:03.853
They already killed Frank,
they killed your father,

01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:05.056
they did this to me
last night,

01:40:05.122 --> 01:40:06.456
these people
aren't gonna stop.

01:40:06.523 --> 01:40:07.557
What's Billy
got to do with it?

01:40:07.624 --> 01:40:08.825
He knows something about it.

01:40:08.892 --> 01:40:10.660
No. No, wait,
that's not possible.

01:40:10.727 --> 01:40:12.462
He and my friend Frank
were working together on it.

01:40:12.529 --> 01:40:13.863
He doesn't even...

01:40:13.930 --> 01:40:16.968
He didn't even know
what I'm working on.

01:40:17.034 --> 01:40:18.635
I have an uncle
who knows Gabby.

01:40:18.702 --> 01:40:19.971
He got me that job.

01:40:21.871 --> 01:40:23.174
You're not a reporter,
are you?

01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:25.475
No, and my name's not Jake.
It's Lionel.

01:40:25.542 --> 01:40:28.112
Look, Frank is
an investigator, okay?

01:40:28.179 --> 01:40:29.612
That's who I worked for.

01:40:29.679 --> 01:40:31.681
They hired him to keep tabs
on your committee.

01:40:31.748 --> 01:40:33.817
He was following you.

01:40:33.883 --> 01:40:36.420
I... I wasn't trying
to expose anything.

01:40:36.486 --> 01:40:37.721
I just was poking into it

01:40:37.787 --> 01:40:39.789
to try to figure out
who killed him,

01:40:39.856 --> 01:40:41.425
and now there's
so many goddamn pieces,

01:40:41.491 --> 01:40:43.593
it's like I got
glass in my brain

01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:45.997
and I don't even know
what I'm after anymore.

01:40:47.365 --> 01:40:48.631
I'm sorry for lyin' to you,

01:40:48.698 --> 01:40:50.900
but you gotta believe
what I'm sayin'.

01:40:50.968 --> 01:40:52.403
You're webbed up
in this somehow,

01:40:52.470 --> 01:40:53.870
and you're in danger.

01:40:53.937 --> 01:40:55.505
Can you stay around
here today?

01:40:55.572 --> 01:40:56.740
Gabby's expecting me.

01:40:56.806 --> 01:40:58.541
We're preparing our testimony.

01:40:58.608 --> 01:41:00.111
It's important, but...

01:41:02.313 --> 01:41:04.714
I need to make arrangements.

01:41:04.781 --> 01:41:06.117
- A funeral.
- Look,

01:41:06.183 --> 01:41:08.019
none of that matters, okay?
If I'm right,

01:41:08.085 --> 01:41:09.619
they're gonna keep a tight lid
on it and they won't even let

01:41:09.686 --> 01:41:11.222
the coroner's office
release his body. Just...

01:41:11.989 --> 01:41:12.990
Please.

01:41:13.057 --> 01:41:14.291
Get one of the guys
from the club

01:41:14.358 --> 01:41:15.925
to take you down to work.

01:41:15.993 --> 01:41:18.496
Stay around people that you
know for the next few days.

01:41:18.561 --> 01:41:20.131
I'll come and find you.

01:41:20.930 --> 01:41:22.066
Okay?

01:41:25.436 --> 01:41:26.936
Ah, okay, okay.

01:41:27.004 --> 01:41:28.973
All right, all right,
all right.

01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:30.007
Take it easy.

01:41:30.074 --> 01:41:31.475
Jeez, they sent
the pros today.

01:41:31.541 --> 01:41:33.810
I must have...
I must have hit a nerve.

01:41:54.631 --> 01:41:56.133
Oh, jeez, thanks.

01:42:01.172 --> 01:42:03.207
Hold this for me,
will you, sweetheart?

01:42:23.327 --> 01:42:25.628
You know who I am?

01:42:25.695 --> 01:42:27.398
I've been asking around
about that.

01:42:27.465 --> 01:42:30.000
Everyone seems to have
a different answer, though.

01:42:31.001 --> 01:42:33.404
Spoken like a true snoop.

01:42:33.471 --> 01:42:35.339
Well, what's your take on it?

01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:37.241
Easy.

01:42:39.176 --> 01:42:40.377
I'm a builder.

01:42:41.878 --> 01:42:43.380
Yeah, I can see that.

01:42:44.215 --> 01:42:45.983
When I was a boy,

01:42:46.050 --> 01:42:47.051
you know how many
bridges there were

01:42:47.118 --> 01:42:48.586
on and off Manhattan Island?

01:42:48.651 --> 01:42:50.287
Two.

01:42:50.354 --> 01:42:52.389
A shitty little train trestle
here and the Brooklyn Bridge,

01:42:52.456 --> 01:42:53.857
and when you crossed that,

01:42:53.923 --> 01:42:55.226
you were stepping over manure
much of the way.

01:42:55.292 --> 01:42:57.294
People mostly scuttled
into New York

01:42:57.361 --> 01:42:59.230
off of docks, like rats.

01:42:59.997 --> 01:43:02.600
I built that, and that...

01:43:02.665 --> 01:43:03.933
and that...

01:43:04.368 --> 01:43:05.536
and that.

01:43:05.603 --> 01:43:07.871
And now,
people vault over rivers

01:43:07.937 --> 01:43:10.141
on the spans
and parkways of...

01:43:11.575 --> 01:43:13.978
- Olympus.
- Olympic rat-man!

01:43:14.044 --> 01:43:15.045
Sorry.

01:43:15.112 --> 01:43:16.347
Hmm.

01:43:16.413 --> 01:43:17.680
They're some pretty bridges,
I'll give you that.

01:43:17.747 --> 01:43:19.083
Thank you.

01:43:19.150 --> 01:43:20.551
I want you to give me
something else

01:43:20.618 --> 01:43:21.986
if you can find it.

01:43:23.454 --> 01:43:24.854
Have you found it?

01:43:24.921 --> 01:43:26.190
What's in it?

01:43:26.257 --> 01:43:27.891
Slander, falsehood,

01:43:27.958 --> 01:43:29.326
forgery, most likely.

01:43:29.393 --> 01:43:30.860
Well, then,
the law's on your side.

01:43:30.927 --> 01:43:32.096
You got nothin'
to worry about.

01:43:32.163 --> 01:43:33.830
Very little
I've achieved in my life

01:43:33.897 --> 01:43:36.100
has relied on legality.

01:43:36.167 --> 01:43:39.203
I'm not about to lean
on that slender branch now,

01:43:39.270 --> 01:43:41.172
when things matter most.

01:43:41.238 --> 01:43:43.073
So, you're above the law?
That it?

01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:44.308
No.

01:43:44.375 --> 01:43:45.442
I'm just ahead of it.

01:43:45.509 --> 01:43:46.644
What's the difference?

01:43:46.709 --> 01:43:48.078
Well, the law's a rule book

01:43:48.145 --> 01:43:50.347
we make for the times
we find ourselves in.

01:43:50.414 --> 01:43:52.183
You rebuild the city,
in my experience,

01:43:52.249 --> 01:43:55.152
the law will follow you
and adapt to what you do.

01:43:55.219 --> 01:43:57.321
Yeah, a lot of people like
the city the way it is.

01:43:57.388 --> 01:43:58.455
Who you rebuildin' it for?

01:43:59.423 --> 01:44:00.457
The people to come.

01:44:01.891 --> 01:44:03.760
Fifty, 100 years from now,

01:44:03.826 --> 01:44:06.230
what will matter
of what we've done now?

01:44:06.297 --> 01:44:10.301
What will help people
to make science fiction real?

01:44:10.367 --> 01:44:12.102
The laws of today?

01:44:12.169 --> 01:44:14.338
Or roads and bridges
and tunnels

01:44:14.405 --> 01:44:16.540
for commerce
to move swiftly over?

01:44:16.607 --> 01:44:18.075
Beaches and parks
to let people

01:44:18.142 --> 01:44:20.311
escape the rat race
and inspire the mind?

01:44:20.377 --> 01:44:24.048
Palaces of culture where
hellish slums used to be?

01:44:24.114 --> 01:44:26.716
It all sounds pretty grand,
I guess,

01:44:26.783 --> 01:44:28.619
unless you happen to be
one of the people

01:44:28.686 --> 01:44:31.422
whose house is in the way
right now.

01:44:33.756 --> 01:44:35.259
Central Park,

01:44:35.326 --> 01:44:36.994
the greatest urban park
in the world.

01:44:37.061 --> 01:44:38.329
When they started
work on that,

01:44:38.395 --> 01:44:40.431
there wasn't even a city
above 57th Street.

01:44:40.497 --> 01:44:44.368
They kicked out farmers
and tenant squatters,

01:44:44.435 --> 01:44:48.005
sheep-herders out
of muddy fields and filth.

01:44:48.072 --> 01:44:49.640
They moved a few trees.

01:44:49.707 --> 01:44:53.910
And people protested about
the loss of the countryside.

01:44:53.978 --> 01:44:56.879
And if one man hadn't seen
ahead to what we'd need,

01:44:56.946 --> 01:45:00.084
this city would be unlivable,
would it not?

01:45:00.750 --> 01:45:01.952
Yes, it would.

01:45:03.287 --> 01:45:06.223
Most people don't even know
Fred Olmsted's name,

01:45:06.290 --> 01:45:08.359
yet they should thank him
every day.

01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:11.262
I do.

01:45:18.202 --> 01:45:21.205
The important thing in this
life is to get things done.

01:45:21.272 --> 01:45:24.208
Those who can, build.
Those who can't, criticize.

01:45:24.275 --> 01:45:26.977
And I will not obstruct
the great work of this world,

01:45:27.044 --> 01:45:28.746
while some chipmunks
are screeching

01:45:28.811 --> 01:45:30.347
about having to relocate
their nuts.

01:45:30.414 --> 01:45:32.016
Screech a nut, munk-chip.

01:45:32.082 --> 01:45:34.285
Chip a munk's love nuts, man.

01:45:34.784 --> 01:45:36.053
Uh...

01:45:37.021 --> 01:45:38.689
I can't control it, I'm sorry.

01:45:38.756 --> 01:45:39.957
It's all right.

01:45:41.458 --> 01:45:45.029
Talent and brains are rewarded
in this building, Lionel.

01:45:45.095 --> 01:45:47.698
If you're with us,
I'll see to it personally

01:45:47.765 --> 01:45:51.035
that your gifts
are appreciated.

01:45:53.237 --> 01:45:55.139
But that's the offer today.

01:45:57.241 --> 01:45:59.510
You let me know
where you stand by tonight.

01:46:11.888 --> 01:46:13.657
It's funny. We read it wrong.

01:46:13.724 --> 01:46:15.059
How's that?

01:46:15.125 --> 01:46:17.194
We didn't make you for the ace
in Minna's deck.

01:46:17.261 --> 01:46:18.429
Ace-hole!

01:46:18.495 --> 01:46:20.030
Ace-hole!

01:46:27.237 --> 01:46:28.439
- You good?
- No.

01:46:28.505 --> 01:46:31.041
Loosey, goosey,
thread-head fuck!

01:46:31.108 --> 01:46:33.077
Jesus, Lionel. Calm down.

01:46:33.143 --> 01:46:34.611
It's a missing piece, Danny.

01:46:34.678 --> 01:46:36.313
It's a missing piece
and I can't see it.

01:46:36.380 --> 01:46:39.049
It's makin'
my fuckin' brain hurt.

01:46:52.895 --> 01:46:54.365
Where's the rest?

01:46:54.431 --> 01:46:55.999
- Where's the rest of these?
- They're in the desk,

01:46:56.066 --> 01:46:57.067
but those are the only ones
with her in 'em.

01:46:57.134 --> 01:46:58.335
No, get 'em, get 'em, get 'em.

01:46:58.402 --> 01:47:00.037
These are all
from before she arrived.

01:47:00.104 --> 01:47:01.205
There was ones of Billy.

01:47:01.271 --> 01:47:02.973
- Yeah, look...
- Shutterbug shit!

01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:05.042
God. Jesus, Lionel.

01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:06.543
That's her father,
comin' out of the door.

01:47:06.610 --> 01:47:08.112
We saw all these.

01:47:08.178 --> 01:47:10.114
That's some bum
hustlin' for money.

01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:13.317
He yelled at him for a second,
but she's not in these.

01:47:14.051 --> 01:47:16.153
That son of a bitch!

01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:17.321
Where's the car keys?

01:47:17.388 --> 01:47:18.989
Coney and Tony got 'em both...

01:47:19.056 --> 01:47:20.290
Wait, where...

01:47:21.392 --> 01:47:23.260
What'd I miss?

01:47:24.661 --> 01:47:25.763
Where are we going?

01:47:25.829 --> 01:47:26.964
I need you
to look at something.

01:47:29.299 --> 01:47:31.034
Who's that with your father?

01:47:31.101 --> 01:47:32.102
- Where did you get...
- Answer the question!

01:47:32.169 --> 01:47:33.903
Do you know who that is?

01:47:33.971 --> 01:47:35.406
Paul.

01:47:35.472 --> 01:47:36.640
Paul Morris.

01:47:36.707 --> 01:47:38.542
Paul, your uncle Paul,
who got you this job.

01:47:38.609 --> 01:47:40.277
Don't shine me.
I already know who he is.

01:47:40.344 --> 01:47:41.911
- My father...
- Yeah, your father

01:47:41.979 --> 01:47:43.313
and your uncle Paul,
and my friend Frank,

01:47:43.380 --> 01:47:44.715
put all this together somehow.

01:47:44.782 --> 01:47:46.049
- No...
- Yes, God damn it!

01:47:46.116 --> 01:47:47.184
Just tell me
what the hell is goin' on.

01:47:47.251 --> 01:47:48.385
- No!
- Are you involved in this

01:47:48.452 --> 01:47:49.720
- or not?
- No, that's not my father

01:47:49.787 --> 01:47:51.121
with my uncle Paul.

01:47:51.188 --> 01:47:53.090
It's my uncle Billy
with my father, Paul.

01:47:53.791 --> 01:47:55.459
Pull it farther!

01:47:55.526 --> 01:47:57.261
What did you say?

01:47:57.327 --> 01:47:59.563
Remember that picture
of my mother?

01:47:59.630 --> 01:48:02.599
Now look at Billy.
Now look at me.

01:48:03.033 --> 01:48:04.401
You see?

01:48:05.803 --> 01:48:07.738
The rest of the world might
look past me without seeing,

01:48:07.805 --> 01:48:09.206
but I don't.

01:48:09.273 --> 01:48:11.208
- Wait, they told you this?
- They never said so,

01:48:11.275 --> 01:48:13.310
but it doesn't take much
to put it together.

01:48:13.377 --> 01:48:15.245
Why else would he take
such an interest in me?

01:48:15.312 --> 01:48:17.114
Take care of me
when Billy was in the war?

01:48:17.181 --> 01:48:18.982
Pay for law school
when he's got nothin'?

01:48:19.049 --> 01:48:21.385
Whoever he is,
he's using you now.

01:48:21.452 --> 01:48:23.821
He's using you to get back
at his own brother.

01:48:23.887 --> 01:48:25.422
I don't think he's got family.

01:48:25.489 --> 01:48:28.826
Yeah, look, his name's not
Morris, okay? It's Randolph.

01:48:28.892 --> 01:48:30.961
Moses Randolph is his brother.

01:48:31.028 --> 01:48:32.463
And he's using you
to blackmail him.

01:48:32.529 --> 01:48:35.599
- That's not...
- It is. It is, I'm sorry.

01:48:35.666 --> 01:48:38.168
Just wait here, all right?

01:48:38.235 --> 01:48:40.103
Wait here until I get back.

01:48:41.905 --> 01:48:43.807
That's not possible!

01:48:48.445 --> 01:48:49.746
You know what that tells me?

01:48:49.813 --> 01:48:51.315
That tells me you and Billy
set this up

01:48:51.381 --> 01:48:52.583
with Minna to blackmail
your brother.

01:48:52.649 --> 01:48:53.851
Where'd you get this?

01:48:53.917 --> 01:48:55.686
It's you who figured out
the scam they're running.

01:48:55.752 --> 01:48:57.187
It's you who found whatever
it is they're so scared of,

01:48:57.254 --> 01:48:58.789
but you made it look like
it came from Laura

01:48:58.856 --> 01:49:00.190
- and the committee...
- No.

01:49:00.257 --> 01:49:01.592
...so you could hide
behind her and Frank.

01:49:01.658 --> 01:49:03.260
- That's not true.
- People are getting killed.

01:49:03.327 --> 01:49:04.394
- You got it wrong.
- You got your own daughter's

01:49:04.461 --> 01:49:05.929
- life at risk...
- You don't...

01:49:05.996 --> 01:49:08.198
You don't know what
you're fucking talking about!

01:49:10.267 --> 01:49:14.037
I could have sunk him
so many times.

01:49:14.104 --> 01:49:16.039
- He sunk me!
- Sing a song of sunk men!

01:49:16.106 --> 01:49:18.175
- He sunk me!
- Sing a song of sunk men!

01:49:18.242 --> 01:49:19.710
Hide behind her?

01:49:21.144 --> 01:49:22.346
I gave up everything for her.

01:49:22.412 --> 01:49:24.748
Everything I could
have accomplished

01:49:24.815 --> 01:49:26.116
my whole goddamn life.

01:49:26.183 --> 01:49:27.584
That's what happened
between you and him?

01:49:27.651 --> 01:49:28.652
You were with her mother,

01:49:28.719 --> 01:49:30.487
and he hates colored people
so much...

01:49:30.554 --> 01:49:33.490
I will not discuss
such things with you!

01:49:35.025 --> 01:49:38.028
I knew you weren't a reporter.

01:49:38.662 --> 01:49:39.830
Load of shit.

01:49:39.897 --> 01:49:40.999
You're Minna's guy.

01:49:41.064 --> 01:49:42.733
Fuckin' right.
He was my friend.

01:49:42.799 --> 01:49:45.269
I'm sorry, but it's not me.

01:49:46.103 --> 01:49:47.604
Frank put it all together.

01:49:47.671 --> 01:49:50.008
He and Billy thought they
could get something out of it.

01:49:50.073 --> 01:49:52.676
Foolish greed.
I tried to stop them.

01:49:52.743 --> 01:49:56.880
Told them that it would
put her at risk, all of them.

01:49:56.947 --> 01:49:58.282
Now look, Frank gets killed,

01:49:58.348 --> 01:50:00.317
Billy panics and calls me
for help,

01:50:00.384 --> 01:50:01.818
that's your picture.

01:50:01.885 --> 01:50:05.188
You're into something
that you don't understand.

01:50:05.255 --> 01:50:07.324
If you just stand up to him,

01:50:07.391 --> 01:50:10.427
on principle, like I did...

01:50:11.261 --> 01:50:14.231
he will ruin you for spite,

01:50:14.298 --> 01:50:16.166
but if you threaten his work,

01:50:16.233 --> 01:50:17.801
he will destroy you.

01:50:17.868 --> 01:50:19.069
Destroy.

01:50:20.704 --> 01:50:22.272
Find Minna's file.

01:50:32.316 --> 01:50:35.652
Frank.
Frankly Frankady Franko.

01:50:37.989 --> 01:50:39.923
What's it all about, Frank?

01:50:46.229 --> 01:50:47.431
You remember what I said.

01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:57.808
I gotta keep this
under my hat, boys.

01:51:00.444 --> 01:51:01.980
Get my hat, you fucking...

01:51:02.046 --> 01:51:03.047
...kept her under my hat...

01:51:03.113 --> 01:51:04.314
If!

01:51:16.193 --> 01:51:18.462
Frank Frankly Frankady Franko.

01:51:18.528 --> 01:51:20.464
Frank Frankly Frankady...

01:51:29.206 --> 01:51:31.241
Hey, take me to Penn Station.

01:52:39.843 --> 01:52:41.912
- Hey, look out!
- No, no, no!

01:53:03.333 --> 01:53:04.534
If!

01:54:14.304 --> 01:54:15.572
You found it?

01:54:17.374 --> 01:54:18.575
Yeah.

01:54:20.677 --> 01:54:24.481
There's only one way I can
make sense of that, though.

01:54:24.548 --> 01:54:26.984
He didn't sign that
birth certificate, you did.

01:54:30.254 --> 01:54:31.454
Yes.

01:54:33.790 --> 01:54:34.891
I signed it.

01:54:36.626 --> 01:54:39.696
Billy brought her
to our family home.

01:54:39.763 --> 01:54:42.300
Our servants tried
to send them away,

01:54:42.365 --> 01:54:43.834
but Billy started yelling.

01:54:43.900 --> 01:54:46.703
We were having dinner with
our mother, for God's sake.

01:54:46.770 --> 01:54:48.738
I followed Mo to the door.

01:54:49.273 --> 01:54:50.473
He scorned them.

01:54:50.540 --> 01:54:52.609
Refused to acknowledge.

01:54:52.676 --> 01:54:55.213
But I saw the truth
on her face

01:54:55.279 --> 01:54:58.149
and his,
the way he looked at her.

01:54:58.216 --> 01:55:01.418
- You confronted him about it?
- I begged him!

01:55:01.484 --> 01:55:04.421
I invoked every principle
and value

01:55:04.487 --> 01:55:07.058
that we had been raised
to champion.

01:55:07.891 --> 01:55:09.559
I was in anguish.

01:55:10.427 --> 01:55:11.862
You can't understand.

01:55:11.928 --> 01:55:15.266
Our whole young life,
he was my hero.

01:55:15.333 --> 01:55:16.633
We wrote a creed.

01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:20.004
We were going to
fix the world together.

01:55:20.071 --> 01:55:23.307
But to serve people,
you have to love people.

01:55:23.373 --> 01:55:24.774
Mo tried,

01:55:25.742 --> 01:55:27.844
but he was so brilliant,

01:55:27.911 --> 01:55:30.447
that he resented lesser minds

01:55:30.513 --> 01:55:32.482
and became hard.

01:55:32.549 --> 01:55:36.954
Obsessed with winning,
addicted to power,

01:55:37.021 --> 01:55:39.689
totally contemptuous
of ideals.

01:55:39.756 --> 01:55:43.194
This phony
"man of the people."

01:55:43.261 --> 01:55:47.764
When someone isn't seen
for what they truly are,

01:55:47.831 --> 01:55:49.833
that's a very dangerous thing.

01:55:51.568 --> 01:55:53.004
Nobody else knows who she is?

01:55:53.070 --> 01:55:55.273
- Not even Horowitz.
- Why not tell her?

01:55:55.339 --> 01:55:56.806
'Cause she would have used it.

01:55:56.873 --> 01:55:59.943
She would've used it
to good effect, but...

01:56:00.011 --> 01:56:02.579
that would have
destroyed Laura totally.

01:56:04.748 --> 01:56:09.053
Satisfaction won't unburden
a tortured heart.

01:56:10.354 --> 01:56:11.554
So...

01:56:12.622 --> 01:56:13.924
I can hold it.

01:56:15.226 --> 01:56:16.426
So can you.

01:56:17.861 --> 01:56:18.862
Please.

01:56:20.298 --> 01:56:21.498
Yeah.

01:56:29.606 --> 01:56:31.976
It's all in a locker
in Penn Station.

01:56:33.277 --> 01:56:35.578
If anything happens to me,
you send that

01:56:35.645 --> 01:56:37.681
- to Jacob Gleason at the <i>Post.</i>
- The <i>Post?</i>

01:56:37.747 --> 01:56:38.882
He'll know what to do with it.

01:56:38.949 --> 01:56:40.517
The <i>Post</i> is a rag.

01:56:40.583 --> 01:56:43.020
Yeah, but the <i>Times</i> is in
your brother's pocket, too.

01:56:44.921 --> 01:56:47.158
I gotta get her out of town
before that vote.

01:56:55.366 --> 01:56:57.234
Oh!

01:56:58.535 --> 01:57:00.071
What are you doin' here, Tony?

01:57:00.137 --> 01:57:01.905
Watchin' your back.

01:57:03.074 --> 01:57:04.075
Come on.

01:57:04.141 --> 01:57:06.043
What do you say
we go get a drink?

01:57:07.244 --> 01:57:08.578
If!
Sorry.

01:57:08.645 --> 01:57:09.846
How's the eye?

01:57:09.913 --> 01:57:11.581
Gonna hurt for a while.

01:57:11.648 --> 01:57:13.384
How long you been
following me?

01:57:13.451 --> 01:57:14.952
I wasn't.

01:57:15.019 --> 01:57:16.220
They put me on his building,
and I seen you come up.

01:57:16.287 --> 01:57:17.687
"They"?

01:57:17.754 --> 01:57:19.323
Yeah, let's not bullshit
each other, Lionel, okay?

01:57:19.390 --> 01:57:20.590
You been talkin' to 'em, too.

01:57:20.657 --> 01:57:22.559
Yeah, not workin' for 'em.

01:57:22.625 --> 01:57:23.793
I was gonna tell ya.

01:57:23.860 --> 01:57:25.329
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:57:25.396 --> 01:57:27.164
Okay.

01:57:27.231 --> 01:57:30.434
Was that you outside
the club that night?

01:57:30.500 --> 01:57:32.602
I thought I saw
someone in the alley

01:57:32.669 --> 01:57:33.903
when the owner of that place

01:57:33.971 --> 01:57:34.938
was roughin' me up,
makin' threats.

01:57:35.006 --> 01:57:36.207
Did you tell 'em about that?

01:57:36.273 --> 01:57:37.941
They just pay me to keep tabs.

01:57:38.009 --> 01:57:39.377
So, that's what I did.
I keep tabs.

01:57:39.443 --> 01:57:41.245
- What we do, we keep tabs.
- If! If!

01:57:41.312 --> 01:57:44.281
T, he was bluffing.

01:57:44.348 --> 01:57:46.050
He didn't even have it,
and they killed him for it.

01:57:46.117 --> 01:57:47.884
But why try
to figure it out, right?

01:57:47.952 --> 01:57:49.919
- You're just movin' up.
- All right.

01:57:49.987 --> 01:57:51.489
Sell it and tell it,
letter man!

01:57:51.554 --> 01:57:52.555
- Take it easy.
- Tell it and sell it!

01:57:52.622 --> 01:57:53.991
Take it easy. Have a drink.

01:57:54.058 --> 01:57:55.825
Bring me a whiskey up.
What are you drinkin'?

01:57:55.892 --> 01:57:57.228
- I'll have a tea.
- A tea?

01:57:57.294 --> 01:57:59.196
Very hot water
with the teabag on the side.

01:57:59.263 --> 01:58:01.831
And milk and sugar
on the side. Very hot, okay?

01:58:01.898 --> 01:58:03.533
Hot tits on my milky tea face!

01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:05.469
- Don't pay him no mind, doll.
- Sugar tits on my milk face!

01:58:05.535 --> 01:58:06.803
Something wrong with his head.

01:58:06.870 --> 01:58:08.872
Mmm-hmm.

01:58:08.938 --> 01:58:10.107
There's nothin' wrong
with my head.

01:58:10.174 --> 01:58:11.941
Well, you could have
fooled me.

01:58:13.643 --> 01:58:15.279
How long you been
fucking Julia?

01:58:16.846 --> 01:58:19.116
After all the things
he did for you...

01:58:20.384 --> 01:58:22.153
you couldn't go find
someone else to bang?

01:58:22.219 --> 01:58:25.822
Everybody gotta find their
own way in this world, Lionel.

01:58:26.756 --> 01:58:28.192
What, you think
I was just gonna

01:58:28.259 --> 01:58:31.495
stay in Frank's shadow
all my life?

01:58:31.561 --> 01:58:34.131
Okay for you, not for me.

01:58:43.340 --> 01:58:44.341
Careful.

01:58:49.712 --> 01:58:50.914
Come on, can we just have
a real drink here?

01:58:50.981 --> 01:58:52.450
I don't wanna have a drink.

01:58:52.516 --> 01:58:54.185
Well, what's the big fuckin'
deal, Lionel? He's gone.

01:58:54.251 --> 01:58:56.987
Okay? There's nothin'
we can do about it.

01:58:57.054 --> 01:58:58.621
We help 'em
get what they want,

01:58:58.688 --> 01:59:00.657
and we get on a new ride.

01:59:00.723 --> 01:59:02.826
An easier ride, maybe?

01:59:04.095 --> 01:59:05.662
What, after all
we've been through,

01:59:05.728 --> 01:59:07.597
after all we had to do
to fuckin' survive

01:59:07.664 --> 01:59:08.898
just growin' up?

01:59:08.966 --> 01:59:11.435
Come on.
We're due an easy gig.

01:59:11.502 --> 01:59:12.902
You, especially.

01:59:12.970 --> 01:59:15.672
Come on,
I know you got a real talent.

01:59:15.738 --> 01:59:17.475
I'll make sure
there's a place for you.

01:59:17.541 --> 01:59:19.776
Be real partners.

01:59:23.414 --> 01:59:25.882
Let's talk about it
after tomorrow, all right?

01:59:25.949 --> 01:59:27.218
I got somethin'
I gotta take care of.

01:59:27.284 --> 01:59:29.220
Don't go up to Harlem tonight,
Freakshow.

01:59:29.286 --> 01:59:30.753
Stay out of it.

01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:33.290
- What?
- Just don't do it.

01:59:33.357 --> 01:59:36.260
See, I'm not so far out
of the loop as you think.

01:59:37.094 --> 01:59:38.562
We're closin' it up tonight.

01:59:38.628 --> 01:59:41.298
- No, no. Okay, listen to me.
- Just don't get involved.

01:59:41.365 --> 01:59:43.033
I found what they're lookin'
for, all right? I got it!

01:59:43.100 --> 01:59:44.468
- It's the last loose end.
- No, no, no,

01:59:44.535 --> 01:59:46.370
you gotta call 'em, you gotta
call 'em right now

01:59:46.437 --> 01:59:47.438
- and tell 'em to call it off.
- It's already out of my hands.

01:59:47.505 --> 01:59:48.539
Tony, I've got it.

01:59:48.606 --> 01:59:50.107
Come on,
let's just have a drink.

01:59:50.174 --> 01:59:51.509
Fuck!

02:00:03.954 --> 02:00:05.655
You son of a bitch!

02:00:05.722 --> 02:00:07.724
I tried to help you.

02:00:30.281 --> 02:00:31.982
- Come on!
- <i>Committee on Housing.</i>

02:00:32.049 --> 02:00:33.284
Can I speak to Laura Rose,
please?

02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:34.552
<i>I'm sorry,
she's gone for the day.</i>

02:00:34.618 --> 02:00:36.020
- What?
- <i>She went home.</i>

02:00:36.086 --> 02:00:37.288
- <i>She wasn't feeling well.</i>
- Where'd she go?

02:00:37.354 --> 02:00:38.656
- When?
- <i>I'm sorry, who is this?</i>

02:00:38.721 --> 02:00:40.558
- When?
- <i>About 15 minutes ago.</i>

02:01:01.378 --> 02:01:04.315
Take me to Harlem! Step on it!
I got money!

02:01:04.381 --> 02:01:05.482
149th and St. Nicholas!

02:01:17.794 --> 02:01:19.697
If! Oh, shit.

02:01:44.521 --> 02:01:46.657
No, no, come on, run it,
run it! I got money!

02:01:46.724 --> 02:01:48.092
If! If! If!

02:01:50.261 --> 02:01:51.894
<i>Train's going out of service.</i>

02:01:51.962 --> 02:01:52.929
<i>It will not proceed
beyond this station.</i>

02:01:56.933 --> 02:01:58.801
Now, you... Go across 141st.

02:02:01.972 --> 02:02:04.074
Yeah, up St. Nic's,
up St. Nic's.

02:02:10.748 --> 02:02:12.549
Stop, stop, stop!
Stop right here!

02:02:13.684 --> 02:02:14.817
Laura!

02:02:14.884 --> 02:02:16.186
Shit.

02:02:22.925 --> 02:02:24.528
Son of a bitch.

02:02:47.117 --> 02:02:48.319
Laura.

02:02:48.385 --> 02:02:50.087
What are you doing...

02:03:03.133 --> 02:03:04.335
Come on.

02:03:05.269 --> 02:03:06.270
Come on.

02:03:32.062 --> 02:03:34.331
No, no, not down there.
They're down there.

02:03:42.473 --> 02:03:43.674
Go up, go up.

02:03:43.741 --> 02:03:45.109
They're goin' up!

02:04:01.058 --> 02:04:02.659
No! No!

02:04:18.575 --> 02:04:19.576
Go, go, go!

02:04:35.793 --> 02:04:37.227
Come here. You all right?

02:04:37.294 --> 02:04:39.196
- We gotta go.
- Okay.

02:04:52.876 --> 02:04:54.077
If!

02:04:57.181 --> 02:05:00.184
She doesn't know!
She doesn't know.

02:05:00.250 --> 02:05:02.686
Makes no difference
one way or the other.

02:05:02.753 --> 02:05:05.022
But I found what he's
looking for. Just tell him.

02:05:05.088 --> 02:05:06.256
Tell him I got it.

02:05:06.323 --> 02:05:08.492
No, no, no.
That offer expired.

02:05:09.560 --> 02:05:12.196
And they told me
you were smart.

02:05:14.531 --> 02:05:15.966
Motherfucker.

02:05:17.935 --> 02:05:20.037
Smoked my best horn.

02:05:26.210 --> 02:05:28.045
No, I want to see him alone.

02:05:28.111 --> 02:05:30.547
Yes, right now.

02:05:30.614 --> 02:05:32.516
Let me tell you something.
You try anything funny,

02:05:32.583 --> 02:05:33.952
and tomorrow's gonna be
the worst day

02:05:34.017 --> 02:05:35.018
that you've had
in a long time,

02:05:35.085 --> 02:05:36.320
you understand?

02:05:46.430 --> 02:05:48.065
Do you know where that is?

02:05:49.533 --> 02:05:50.601
I heard of it.

02:05:50.667 --> 02:05:53.103
Think you can get her
out there tonight?

02:05:54.938 --> 02:05:57.641
I always did enjoy
a night drive.

02:06:04.348 --> 02:06:06.216
Go with them, okay?

02:06:06.850 --> 02:06:08.719
You'll be safe.

02:06:08.785 --> 02:06:10.320
I'll come in the morning.

02:06:11.990 --> 02:06:14.858
What don't I know?

02:06:14.925 --> 02:06:17.427
<i>It wasn't the story
she wanted to hear.</i>

02:06:17.494 --> 02:06:19.196
<i>No good was gonna
come from tellin' it,</i>

02:06:19.263 --> 02:06:21.365
<i>so I wanted to say,
"It doesn't matter.</i>

02:06:21.431 --> 02:06:23.300
<i>It's got nothin'
to do with you."</i>

02:06:23.367 --> 02:06:25.202
<i>But there's no upside
in lyin' to a woman</i>

02:06:25.269 --> 02:06:26.870
<i>who's smarter than you,</i>

02:06:26.937 --> 02:06:28.238
<i>so, I told her the truth.</i>

02:06:29.473 --> 02:06:30.975
<i>Frank told me once,</i>

02:06:31.041 --> 02:06:32.609
<i>if you're up against
someone bigger than you,</i>

02:06:32.676 --> 02:06:35.112
<i>someone you can't beat
toe to toe,</i>

02:06:35.178 --> 02:06:36.880
<i>make 'em think
you respect their size</i>

02:06:36.947 --> 02:06:39.750
<i>and then cut a deal that lets
you walk out in one piece.</i>

02:06:39.816 --> 02:06:41.718
<i>Then figure out a way
to stick it to 'em later</i>

02:06:41.785 --> 02:06:44.254
<i>without leaving
your prints on the knife.</i>

02:06:45.455 --> 02:06:46.790
<i>Even walkin' in there,</i>

02:06:46.857 --> 02:06:48.592
<i>I wasn't exactly sure
how to play it.</i>

02:06:48.659 --> 02:06:50.761
<i>I was just hoping,
in all that steam,</i>

02:06:50.827 --> 02:06:52.262
<i>he wouldn't see me sweat.</i>

02:06:58.335 --> 02:07:00.070
If!

02:07:07.377 --> 02:07:09.580
Who's the fucking boss now,
Bailey?

02:07:09.646 --> 02:07:11.214
Who's the boss?

02:07:11.983 --> 02:07:13.450
So, what is it with you?

02:07:13.517 --> 02:07:14.818
I told you I can't control it.

02:07:14.885 --> 02:07:16.486
Didn't your goons
fuckin' fill you in already?

02:07:16.553 --> 02:07:18.288
I don't care
about your fuckin' affliction.

02:07:18.355 --> 02:07:19.423
What's your angle with this?

02:07:19.489 --> 02:07:21.191
What do you want
for that file?

02:07:21.258 --> 02:07:22.793
I wanna hear your side
of what's in it.

02:07:22.859 --> 02:07:24.394
Why?

02:07:24.461 --> 02:07:26.530
Let's just say an unfinished
puzzle makes my head hurt.

02:07:26.597 --> 02:07:28.231
All right?
More than most people.

02:07:28.298 --> 02:07:29.600
I smooth it out for
your pain-in-the-ass brain,

02:07:29.666 --> 02:07:31.335
we're puttin' this
to bed tonight?

02:07:31.401 --> 02:07:33.303
Yeah, it's your best shot.

02:07:42.779 --> 02:07:44.481
I was young.

02:07:44.548 --> 02:07:46.050
I was the
"get things done" man

02:07:46.149 --> 02:07:48.785
for the greatest governor
in the history of this state.

02:07:48.852 --> 02:07:50.420
We had a party.

02:07:50.487 --> 02:07:52.056
It was the good times,
before the Crash.

02:07:52.122 --> 02:07:55.258
The Tammany parties were like
nothing before or since.

02:07:55.325 --> 02:07:58.128
We had a whole fuckin' hotel.

02:08:00.163 --> 02:08:01.765
I saw her there, working.

02:08:02.967 --> 02:08:04.167
She was...

02:08:06.336 --> 02:08:09.673
I'd never felt lust
like that before.

02:08:09.740 --> 02:08:11.341
Twenty-five years later,
I think about her,

02:08:11.408 --> 02:08:14.378
it still makes my blood move.

02:08:14.444 --> 02:08:17.681
I followed her
into a service hallway.

02:08:17.748 --> 02:08:19.149
She knew I had.

02:08:19.216 --> 02:08:20.584
She looked back.

02:08:20.651 --> 02:08:23.720
She went into a supply room.
I went in.

02:08:23.787 --> 02:08:26.556
I took her
against the spare towels.

02:08:27.824 --> 02:08:28.925
You raped her.

02:08:30.694 --> 02:08:32.362
I moved on her
that first time,

02:08:32.429 --> 02:08:35.565
but I treated her well,
bought her things.

02:08:35.632 --> 02:08:37.501
Saw to it that the Party
used that hotel

02:08:37.567 --> 02:08:39.670
lots for a few years.

02:08:39.736 --> 02:08:41.605
She could have disappeared
any time,

02:08:41.672 --> 02:08:43.573
stopped working there,
but she didn't.

02:08:47.377 --> 02:08:49.312
She was shy, but she knew
how things worked,

02:08:49.379 --> 02:08:50.580
and she was always grateful.

02:08:50.647 --> 02:08:52.016
Rape?

02:08:52.083 --> 02:08:56.954
Do you have the first inkling
how power works?

02:08:57.021 --> 02:08:59.423
Power is feeling, knowing,

02:08:59.489 --> 02:09:00.824
that you can do
whatever you want,

02:09:00.891 --> 02:09:03.727
and not one fuckin' person
can stop you.

02:09:03.794 --> 02:09:06.530
And if someone else has a dumb
idea that you don't like,

02:09:06.596 --> 02:09:08.198
well, that's the end
of that idea,

02:09:08.265 --> 02:09:11.201
or the end of that person,
if you want.

02:09:11.268 --> 02:09:12.769
And if I wanna build highways

02:09:12.836 --> 02:09:14.404
while the rest of the country
is broke,

02:09:14.471 --> 02:09:17.374
I'll punch through
any damn neighborhood I want.

02:09:17.441 --> 02:09:18.875
If some Negro slum

02:09:18.942 --> 02:09:21.411
is where I'm going to put
my federal project,

02:09:21.478 --> 02:09:22.980
or the off ramp of my bridge,

02:09:23.047 --> 02:09:25.282
well, the goodie-goods can
shriek and moan all day long.

02:09:25.348 --> 02:09:27.250
And if some chump
wants to blackjack me,

02:09:27.317 --> 02:09:28.919
threatening to move
our baseball team,

02:09:28.986 --> 02:09:30.821
well, buddy,
the Dodgers can take it

02:09:30.887 --> 02:09:32.556
on the arches
to the fucking coast.

02:09:32.622 --> 02:09:35.258
I'll find another team
that will play ball with me

02:09:35.325 --> 02:09:37.527
in my stadium.

02:09:37.594 --> 02:09:39.396
And if I want to fuck
some colored girl

02:09:39.463 --> 02:09:40.797
in a hotel room now and then,

02:09:40.864 --> 02:09:42.967
because I'm feeling
like a wrecking ball,

02:09:43.034 --> 02:09:44.901
then, pal, I'm gonna do it.

02:09:46.703 --> 02:09:48.805
And if you think
I'm gonna let some

02:09:48.872 --> 02:09:51.475
chip who never should have
been born,

02:09:51.541 --> 02:09:54.544
or your small-time boss,
or my brother with his ideals

02:09:54.611 --> 02:09:56.646
and his forgeries in my name

02:09:56.713 --> 02:09:59.649
slow down the work
I'm getting done in this city,

02:09:59.716 --> 02:10:02.853
then you've got a lot to learn
about how power works.

02:10:02.919 --> 02:10:05.255
Because those people
are invisible.

02:10:05.322 --> 02:10:06.523
They don't exist.

02:10:08.092 --> 02:10:11.428
See if you feel that way
tomorrow after your big vote.

02:10:17.068 --> 02:10:18.301
She know?

02:10:21.371 --> 02:10:22.639
Huh.

02:10:23.406 --> 02:10:24.574
Interesting.

02:10:24.641 --> 02:10:26.978
So, it's you and Paul?

02:10:27.044 --> 02:10:28.378
Well, I know what he wants.

02:10:28.445 --> 02:10:29.746
If he had any balls,
he would have used it

02:10:29.813 --> 02:10:31.281
before to box me in
and take it from me,

02:10:31.348 --> 02:10:32.916
which I would have respected,
actually,

02:10:32.984 --> 02:10:35.485
but he thinks the way
that you do things matter,

02:10:35.552 --> 02:10:37.587
which is why
he'll never be anybody.

02:10:40.091 --> 02:10:42.093
You an idealist, too?

02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:46.329
You wanna trade that file to
save the block you grew up on?

02:10:46.396 --> 02:10:49.633
Make me move my lines for some
committee of childless women,

02:10:49.699 --> 02:10:52.502
howling about
their Negro adoptees?

02:10:52.569 --> 02:10:55.372
Or are you just another
blackmailing gumshoe

02:10:55.438 --> 02:10:57.307
who wants to transact with me?

02:10:58.408 --> 02:10:59.476
Come on, name it!

02:10:59.543 --> 02:11:01.478
Name it, claim it, shame it!

02:11:05.382 --> 02:11:07.651
That gumshoe was my friend,

02:11:07.717 --> 02:11:10.554
and the girl's the only reason
you're still breathin'.

02:11:12.290 --> 02:11:13.958
Do whatever you want
to this city,

02:11:14.025 --> 02:11:15.993
go build your pyramids
on the Nile,

02:11:16.060 --> 02:11:18.196
just leave her alone.

02:11:18.262 --> 02:11:20.664
Anything happens to her,
I mail it.

02:11:21.364 --> 02:11:22.766
That's it.

02:11:22.833 --> 02:11:24.467
That's all of it.

02:11:30.074 --> 02:11:31.541
Let me make something clear.

02:11:31.608 --> 02:11:33.944
If you or my brother messes
with what I intend to do,

02:11:34.011 --> 02:11:37.447
I'll make her life worse
than I've already made his.

02:11:37.514 --> 02:11:39.549
You tell him I said that.

02:11:45.323 --> 02:11:47.357
Well, I guess we got a deal,
then.

02:11:48.592 --> 02:11:50.527
So, I'll give you one
for free.

02:11:52.163 --> 02:11:53.331
Your man, Lieberman,

02:11:53.396 --> 02:11:55.365
is gonna cause you
some problems.

02:11:57.034 --> 02:11:58.501
How so?

02:11:58.568 --> 02:12:00.304
He owns a piece
of half the companies

02:12:00.370 --> 02:12:02.106
doin' contracts
with slum clearance.

02:12:02.173 --> 02:12:05.109
I'm guessin' he hasn't
told you about that.

02:12:05.176 --> 02:12:06.743
So, when you handle him,

02:12:06.810 --> 02:12:10.147
tell him I told you,
and that's for Frank.

02:12:10.214 --> 02:12:11.748
Son of a bitch.

02:12:17.454 --> 02:12:20.690
You come off weird,
but you're smart.

02:12:20.757 --> 02:12:23.693
You should have
taken my offer.

02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:26.863
Could have made them all get
on their knees and apologize.

02:12:28.099 --> 02:12:29.599
But if she's anything
like her mother,

02:12:29.666 --> 02:12:31.401
I understand the pull.

02:12:34.005 --> 02:12:35.139
Right.

02:12:36.240 --> 02:12:37.674
One more thing.

02:12:39.010 --> 02:12:40.978
Tell my brother
I read his masterwork.

02:12:41.045 --> 02:12:43.014
It's as brilliant
as everyone says.

02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:44.614
Nobody could have
done it better,

02:12:44.681 --> 02:12:45.983
and it's good for everyone,
including me.

02:12:46.050 --> 02:12:48.852
There's not a reason
in the world to deny it.

02:12:48.919 --> 02:12:51.055
Tell him I'll give him
my thoughts in the morning.

02:12:54.158 --> 02:12:55.159
If!

02:13:03.100 --> 02:13:04.701
Son of a bitch!

02:14:09.967 --> 02:14:12.802
<i>Growin' up, I always
thought Frank was a hero.</i>

02:14:12.869 --> 02:14:15.272
<i>But he was no crusader
in the end.</i>

02:14:15.339 --> 02:14:17.441
<i>He was just a gumshoe
tryin' to make a buck</i>

02:14:17.507 --> 02:14:18.976
<i>like everyone else.</i>

02:14:19.043 --> 02:14:21.145
<i>But he didn't have
to go to that war.</i>

02:14:21.212 --> 02:14:22.946
<i>He was old enough to
have skipped it,</i>

02:14:23.014 --> 02:14:24.514
<i>and he went, anyway,
'cause he actually thought</i>

02:14:24.581 --> 02:14:25.949
<i>this country
was worth fighting for.</i>

02:14:27.385 --> 02:14:29.387
<i>I never had anything
I cared about enough</i>

02:14:29.453 --> 02:14:32.689
<i>to look past my own problems,
but Laura did.</i>

02:14:32.756 --> 02:14:34.291
<i>There was a story
she wanted told</i>

02:14:34.358 --> 02:14:35.960
<i>and I figured it was time</i>

02:14:36.027 --> 02:14:38.362
<i>to get off my ass
and pick a side.</i>

02:14:38.429 --> 02:14:40.697
Hey, Gleason, for you.

02:14:40.764 --> 02:14:42.099
<i>Hey, pal,
I'm new to this beat.</i>

02:14:42.166 --> 02:14:43.434
<i>What's the story here?</i>

02:14:43.501 --> 02:14:45.302
<i>Stories of injustice
and despair,</i>

02:14:45.369 --> 02:14:46.703
<i>and back to business as usual.</i>

02:14:46.770 --> 02:14:48.105
<i>The American way.</i>

02:15:35.086 --> 02:15:37.221
Are you crazy?
It's freezin' out.

02:15:49.833 --> 02:15:51.634
What is this place?

02:15:54.438 --> 02:15:55.905
It was Frank's.

02:15:59.742 --> 02:16:01.744
And looks like it's mine now.

02:16:13.390 --> 02:16:16.127
Still lookin' out for you,
after all.

02:16:20.763 --> 02:16:23.033
Funny how things turn out.

02:16:25.369 --> 02:16:26.370
Yeah.

02:16:29.306 --> 02:16:30.707
"Brooklyn's big...

02:16:32.343 --> 02:16:35.012
Brooklyn's big, but there's
things even bigger."

02:16:36.679 --> 02:16:38.048
What's that?

02:16:40.017 --> 02:16:42.785
I think it's something
Frank said to me, but I...

02:16:42.852 --> 02:16:44.721
I can't remember when.

02:16:51.827 --> 02:16:54.198
Maybe this is what he meant.

02:16:55.633 --> 02:16:56.833
If!

02:16:57.635 --> 02:16:58.834
If!
