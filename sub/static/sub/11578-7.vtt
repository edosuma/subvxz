00:23.292 --> 00:25.189
In the criminal justice system,

00:25.189 --> 00:28.833
sexually-based offenses 
are considered especially heinous.

00:28.833 --> 00:30.435
In New York City,

00:30.435 --> 00:33.681
the dedicated detectives who investigate 
these vicious felonies are members

00:33.681 --> 00:36.752
of an elite squad known  
as The Special Victims Unit.

00:36.752 --> 00:38.829
These are their stories.

00:45.478 --> 00:47.480
- Yes, I am! 
- No! You're not!

00:47.480 --> 00:49.200
Shut up, you witch!

00:49.200 --> 00:51.375
What the hell are you doing, 
going through my things for?

00:51.451 --> 00:54.654
You're a liar! You said 
you'd never do that again!

00:54.654 --> 00:57.346
This is the last time, 
you creep.

00:57.424 --> 01:02.020
I can't wait till you die, 
so I can spit on your corpse, you freak!

01:09.169 --> 01:11.228
No. No. No!

01:11.304 --> 01:12.362
Come here.

01:14.007 --> 01:15.133
You want to talk?

01:15.208 --> 01:17.313
Let go of me.

SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT 
SQUAD ROOM 
MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 25

01:21.081 --> 01:23.357
Think of your body 
as part of the crime scene.

01:23.357 --> 01:26.123
Time and body fluids 
erode evidence.

01:26.123 --> 01:28.965
The procedure is we head 
to the hospital,

01:28.965 --> 01:30.317
and then 
I'll take your statement.

01:30.317 --> 01:33.608
So basically the bastard rapes me, 
and you waste time.

01:33.608 --> 01:35.664
- That's the procedure? 
- Ma'am...

01:35.664 --> 01:37.923
- Look here, Officer... 
- Det. Munch.

01:37.923 --> 01:40.669
Perhaps you'd be more comfortable 
with a female detective.

01:40.669 --> 01:44.291
I'd be happy to talk 
to anyone with a brain.

01:45.873 --> 01:48.115
There are five stages of grief.

01:48.115 --> 01:50.423
Try not to go through them 
all at once.

01:50.423 --> 01:52.091
Cute.

01:52.091 --> 01:54.560
I'll talk slower.

01:54.560 --> 01:57.886
I don't need SOP explained to me...

01:57.886 --> 01:59.441
I don't need a rape kit...

01:59.441 --> 02:03.224
and I really don't need you 
to hold my hand!

02:03.747 --> 02:05.322
Look, it doesn't matter 
if you've had prior

02:05.322 --> 02:08.291
- consensual sex with this man. 
- Sure.

02:08.291 --> 02:11.738
Doesn't even matter 
if you're still in a relationship with him.

02:13.112 --> 02:15.822
He's my husband.

02:17.119 --> 02:18.726
You and I need 
to see a doctor.

02:18.726 --> 02:20.808
As soon as you give me an address...

02:20.808 --> 02:23.254
we can pick up your husband.

02:30.393 --> 02:38.086
He's at Manhattan South.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2000/12/01

03:36.339 --> 03:38.922
You care to join us, Detective?

03:38.922 --> 03:41.414
I'd love to, 
but I've got reports to file

03:41.414 --> 03:43.580
and coffee to make.

03:49.998 --> 03:51.659
Regardless of your personal feelings,

03:51.659 --> 03:53.287
I want you on my team.

03:53.287 --> 03:55.717
But only for as long 
as you want to be here.

03:55.717 --> 03:58.675
It's nice to be wanted.

03:58.675 --> 04:02.779
Well, these aren't going 
to file themselves.

04:08.362 --> 04:12.413
So? / Patricia Andrews claims 
her husband raped her this morning.

04:12.413 --> 04:15.619
She's got a sprained wrist, but nothing 
much else to suggest physical abuse.

04:15.619 --> 04:17.336
She doesn't need the beat-up 
to prove it.

04:17.336 --> 04:18.185
It's gonna need 
more than her word,

04:18.185 --> 04:20.201
because my partner...
conveniently forgot to mention

04:20.201 --> 04:22.785
our guy's Homicide, 
Manhattan South.

04:22.785 --> 04:25.826
I didn't mention it, 'cause it's not 
important, at least not to me.

04:25.826 --> 04:28.877
Twenty-year vet, citations a sheet long, 
high closure rate.

04:28.877 --> 04:31.904
Along with making the brass very happy, 
the guy's also a rapist.

04:31.904 --> 04:34.957
- Alleged rapist, thank you.
- Ever hear of "no"?

04:34.957 --> 04:36.582
You ever hear of contractual abandonment?

04:36.582 --> 04:39.545
The only reason to forsake all others 
is so you don't have to hear "no."

04:39.545 --> 04:42.116
I've been married 16 years. 
I hear it all the time.

04:42.116 --> 04:46.229
Okay, Munch, let me clue you in, 
a wife as property went out in 1984...

04:46.229 --> 04:49.810
when the law finally realized that even 
a married woman is allowed to say no.

04:49.810 --> 04:52.577
We get Mrs. Andrew's statement? 
She sign it?

04:52.577 --> 04:54.605
Not yet. It's being typed.

04:54.605 --> 04:57.193
Let's talk to her. Make sure 
she knows what the score is.

04:57.193 --> 05:00.182
Are you doubting what happened 
or her commitment?

05:00.933 --> 05:03.901
I don't have his side of the story, 
and this suspect is a cop.

05:03.901 --> 05:06.599
So Internal Affairs is going 
to be all over this.

05:06.599 --> 05:09.913
I just don't think his badge should 
cushion the blow.

05:13.812 --> 05:16.976
Have you ever rubbed IAB 
the wrong way?

05:16.976 --> 05:18.684
I've never had the pleasure.

05:18.684 --> 05:21.021
Then do it my way.

05:21.021 --> 05:23.138
You two, canvass the neighbors.

05:23.138 --> 05:24.723
Get some background 
on the happy couple.

05:24.723 --> 05:28.097
John, you and your partner have 
a chat with the missis.

05:28.097 --> 05:31.365
I will apprise the powers that be.

05:31.365 --> 05:34.072
You know, if it turns out 
that he did in fact rape her...

05:34.072 --> 05:37.018
and we didn't follow standard op, 
we're going to get buried in it.

05:37.018 --> 05:39.620
That's going to happen regardless.

05:44.239 --> 05:47.170
There's no smoking 
in government buildings.

05:55.839 --> 05:59.205
Please read your statement 
carefully, then sign.

05:59.205 --> 06:01.725
Where's your husband right now?

06:01.725 --> 06:05.798
Every day he plays pick-up ball with 
some cop friends before his shift.

06:05.798 --> 06:10.640
Before you put pen to paper, 
I want to hear it again in your own words.

06:10.640 --> 06:14.823
Why? / You're going to have to 
get used to telling your story.

06:16.816 --> 06:20.305
- Are you married?
- No, ma'am.

06:20.305 --> 06:22.407
I know you're not. 
Who'd have you?

06:22.407 --> 06:23.657
Are you always this pleasant?

06:23.657 --> 06:25.571
Meaning, I got what 
was coming to me?

06:25.571 --> 06:29.720
That's not how I see it, Mrs. Andrews. 
Nobody deserves this.

06:30.857 --> 06:33.710
We've been married five years.

06:34.578 --> 06:36.676
I just don't understand.

06:36.676 --> 06:39.675
I've seen him get crazy, 
but never like this.

06:39.675 --> 06:43.631
We fight, we make love.

06:45.183 --> 06:46.889
I almost don't believe it myself.

06:46.889 --> 06:49.523
Maybe he thought you were making up. 
Is that possible?

06:49.523 --> 06:52.665
A chokehold is not foreplay 
for me, Detective.

06:52.665 --> 06:55.153
And a pot to the head turns him on?

06:57.990 --> 07:01.310
You're not going to do 
a damn thing to him.

07:01.310 --> 07:03.866
No, not a damn thing.

07:03.866 --> 07:07.406
If your story holds up, I'm gonna have 
to arrest him, Mrs. Andrews...

07:07.406 --> 07:10.135
put cuffs on him, process him, 
and lock him up in a cage.

07:10.135 --> 07:12.300
I just want to make sure 
you understand that.

07:12.300 --> 07:14.546
What do you take me for?

07:21.257 --> 07:24.062
HOME OF CYRUS PARKER
211 EAST 24TH STREET
MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 25

07:24.062 --> 07:26.771
I wasn't expecting company.

07:27.267 --> 07:28.386
What's this about?

07:28.386 --> 07:31.034
We wanted to ask you 
about your neighbors next door.

07:31.034 --> 07:34.439
Well, have a seat, please.

07:34.439 --> 07:36.034
Do you know the Andrews?

07:36.034 --> 07:38.734
- Who?
- They live on the first floor.

07:38.734 --> 07:41.560
Mrs. Andrews, she's about 5'5", 
110, blond hair.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.946
Mr. Andrews is a cop.

07:43.946 --> 07:45.448
You mean the Springers.

07:45.448 --> 07:48.953
No, we mean the Andrews.

07:48.953 --> 07:52.676
People around here barely 
want to make eye contact...

07:52.676 --> 07:55.701
so you can forget about introductions.

07:55.701 --> 07:59.301
They're the Springers to me. 
Better than the show.

07:59.301 --> 08:01.723
I take it, that means that they fight a lot.

08:01.723 --> 08:04.883
Every day. 
Sometimes the cops come.

08:04.883 --> 08:08.663
He pulls them aside. 
Then they leave.

08:08.663 --> 08:11.441
I always wondered 
if he paid them off.

08:11.441 --> 08:12.683
Did they fight this morning?

08:12.683 --> 08:15.435
He left the house, 
trying to get away from her.

08:15.435 --> 08:18.607
She came through the door 
and threw a pot.

08:18.607 --> 08:20.694
That woman's got a hell of an aim.

08:20.694 --> 08:23.916
Did you see him 
strike her? / No.

08:23.916 --> 08:27.699
But he turned around 
and snatched her inside.

08:27.699 --> 08:32.455
Did you see or hear 
anything else? / No.

08:32.455 --> 08:35.288
Did something bad happen?

08:37.956 --> 08:39.222
Gentlemen.

08:39.222 --> 08:44.341
Det. Santiago, my partner, 
Det. Howard, Internal Affairs.

08:44.341 --> 08:46.311
Nice to meet you.

08:47.295 --> 08:49.711
Just give me the word. Is it mine, 
or do I kick it to you?

08:49.711 --> 08:52.018
We're not equipped to deal 
with sex crimes.

08:52.018 --> 08:54.187
Have a nice day.

08:54.187 --> 08:56.637
You know, I'd be sore, too.

08:57.945 --> 08:59.389
I'm not following.

08:59.389 --> 09:02.113
We know IAB used you 
to bring down your mentor.

09:02.113 --> 09:04.385
We just want you to know 
those were the old days.

09:04.385 --> 09:05.692
That is truly comforting.

09:05.692 --> 09:07.588
We're not here to grind your wheat.

09:07.588 --> 09:10.288
Just do us a favor, 
take it slow and easy.

09:10.288 --> 09:12.006
Finesse and kid gloves.

09:12.006 --> 09:14.548
Since when does IAB 
care about finesse?

09:14.548 --> 09:16.552
Come on, give us a break.
The guy's not on the take,

09:16.552 --> 09:19.346
skimming drugs, 
or pimping on the side.

09:19.346 --> 09:23.970
Isn't it enough that we kiss 
their collective PC ass?

09:23.970 --> 09:25.447
What's next, castration?

09:25.447 --> 09:28.136
We marry them just 
to have it available.

09:28.136 --> 09:31.671
So tell me, how do you rape a wife?

09:33.553 --> 09:37.369
Okay.
Thanks.

09:37.369 --> 09:40.002
We got four domestic disputes 
at the Andrews' residence.

09:40.002 --> 09:41.495
Dispo'd at the scene.

09:41.495 --> 09:44.979
No arrests. Same uniforms, 
Clarkson and Powell.

09:44.979 --> 09:47.622
- Are they on tour?
- Just signed out for a break.

09:47.622 --> 09:49.922
- No arrests?
- Nope.

09:51.036 --> 09:54.318
- Thanks. Have a nice day.
- Powell and Clarkson?

09:56.971 --> 09:58.701
So the groom's mother goes 
to the bride's mother and asks:

09:58.701 --> 10:00.573
"Why is the bride smiling?"

10:00.573 --> 10:02.669
'Cause she never has 
to get on her knees again.

10:02.669 --> 10:04.207
Old joke. Do you mind?

10:04.207 --> 10:06.950
Det. Benson, I'm Det. Stabler, SVU.

10:06.950 --> 10:10.723
We want to talk to you 
about the DIRs at the Andrews' place.

10:10.723 --> 10:13.794
Right. Nothing to it. 
Handled at the scene each time.

10:13.794 --> 10:15.223
The last one out, 
we told the sarge...

10:15.223 --> 10:18.031
if it happened again, 
we'd have no choice. Why?

10:18.031 --> 10:20.886
Well, four times is 
three times too many.

10:20.886 --> 10:22.614
You see abuse, 
you take action, right?

10:22.614 --> 10:25.915
He's a fellow officer. 
He asked a favor, we gave it.

10:25.915 --> 10:27.905
So you look the other way 
no matter what?

10:27.905 --> 10:31.360
Is that in your cop manual? 
Because it sure as hell ain't in mine.

10:31.360 --> 10:33.930
- What gives?
- You didn't do your job.

10:33.930 --> 10:35.944
And because you didn't, 
we caught it.

10:35.944 --> 10:39.549
And since it rolls downhill, 
I figured you're next.

10:40.083 --> 10:43.926
Sarge and his wife fight, 
loud and hard.

10:43.926 --> 10:46.814
Names they call each other, I wouldn't 
say to a hump in the back of my cruiser.

10:46.814 --> 10:49.083
It blows real hot, then it's over.

10:49.083 --> 10:51.262
Besides, if we really 
wanted to do him a favor...

10:51.262 --> 10:54.484
we'd run his old lady in, 
no matter what he said.

10:54.484 --> 10:57.322
Okay, wait a minute, you're telling 
us that his wife's the abuser?

10:57.322 --> 10:59.230
Don't know if I'd say that.

10:59.230 --> 11:04.166
But when she gets ticked off, 
she likes to throw whatever's handy.

11:06.424 --> 11:07.867
Well, how real does it look?

11:07.867 --> 11:09.278
It's hard to say.

11:09.278 --> 11:10.606
Break up to make up.

11:10.606 --> 11:13.368
Wife's a bit of a bruiser, 
Andrews seems to be handling it.

11:13.368 --> 11:14.537
By raping her?

11:14.537 --> 11:15.538
I'm not a fly on their bedroom wall.

11:15.538 --> 11:18.462
That's too bad. 'Cause what's 
this cop going to say when we ask?

11:18.462 --> 11:20.970
"I raped my wife. 
Please, put me in jail."

11:20.970 --> 11:22.580
Why don't we let the ADA decide?

11:22.580 --> 11:24.600
It looks like she might not have to.

11:24.600 --> 11:28.718
For the first time in my career, 
IAB acts like they want to flush it.

11:28.718 --> 11:32.459
So either there's some other agenda, 
or this could come back to bite us.

11:32.459 --> 11:33.921
Bring Andrews in for an interview.

11:33.921 --> 11:38.046
I don't think we can, without some SBA 
lawyer turning him into a deaf-mute.

11:38.046 --> 11:40.060
Any other ideas?

11:40.060 --> 11:42.015
If it's not official, 
it's not going to hold up.

11:42.015 --> 11:44.021
I'm not looking for 
a confession, Elliot.

11:44.021 --> 11:48.239
I just want to get a read on this guy 
before he gets wise.

11:49.534 --> 11:52.754
- Pick him up. / - I got him.
- Take it up. It's all you.

11:54.654 --> 11:56.042
Who's next?

11:57.624 --> 12:00.898
Lloyd Andrews, Homicide. 
Ceasar Vasques out of Vice.

12:00.898 --> 12:03.363
- Danny Tatum, he's one of mine.
- Elliot Stabler, SVU.

12:03.363 --> 12:06.045
Sex crimes. 
I hear that's a tough gig.

12:06.045 --> 12:08.572
I hear they rotate you guys out every 
two years. Is it really that rough?

12:08.572 --> 12:10.713
Well, Homicide's no picnic, 
either, right?

12:10.713 --> 12:13.048
A body's past caring whether 
you close a case or not.

12:13.048 --> 12:17.180
Live victims are needy. 
Takes a real strong cop to suck it up.

12:17.180 --> 12:18.220
- Two on two? 
- Yeah,

12:18.220 --> 12:22.263
you're on my team. 
Take it to the hole.

12:32.280 --> 12:34.064
- What the hell was that?
- What's the matter?

12:34.064 --> 12:35.919
There's no fouls on the blacktop.

12:35.919 --> 12:38.272
What's the matter? 
Can't you take it?

12:38.272 --> 12:40.130
Hey, come on, guys. 
Let's play ball.

12:40.130 --> 12:42.831
Your ball.

12:53.550 --> 12:55.959
Knock it off. Come on. Move!

12:55.959 --> 12:57.482
Calm down, man. Knock it off.

12:57.482 --> 13:00.752
Okay, what'd I miss?

13:01.681 --> 13:04.814
Tatum's trying to give you a message, 
all right? But I don't operate that way.

13:04.814 --> 13:07.475
He and I will have words later. 
You okay?

13:07.475 --> 13:09.489
I guess I don't understand his language.

13:09.489 --> 13:12.069
Don't you?

13:12.069 --> 13:14.746
Why don't you spell it out for me?

13:14.746 --> 13:16.282
I'll tell you what.

13:16.282 --> 13:18.983
You can ask me all the questions 
you want after the game.

13:18.983 --> 13:21.239
Questions?

13:22.327 --> 13:24.457
Rape, right?

13:31.806 --> 13:34.325
And maybe the guy was telling me 
what I wanted to hear...

13:34.325 --> 13:36.724
but he seemed pretty genuine to me.

13:36.724 --> 13:40.077
Was this before or after 
his goon kicked your ass?

13:40.077 --> 13:42.689
Andrews did know that 
we were looking into him.

13:42.689 --> 13:43.837
Okay, yeah, well.

13:43.837 --> 13:45.484
So his partner got overly enthusiastic.

13:45.484 --> 13:47.821
Andrews stepped in and saved 
the other eye, didn't he?

13:47.821 --> 13:50.426
I'd like to believe that Fin would 
show me the same kind of loyalty.

13:50.426 --> 13:52.926
A little history first, 
might help your case.

13:52.926 --> 13:57.684
So all we have thus far, is a physically 
abusive woman crying rape. Is that the gist?

13:57.684 --> 14:00.039
What motive could she have for saying 
that her husband raped her?

14:00.039 --> 14:01.866
Pending divorce, for one.

14:01.866 --> 14:03.961
You don't have to worry about 
fighting over which half you get...

14:03.961 --> 14:06.142
when the mate you hate's 
locked in a cell.

14:06.142 --> 14:08.413
We already checked that. 
No papers were filed.

14:08.413 --> 14:12.919
All she has to do is wait. 
We get rid of him for her, then she files.

14:13.678 --> 14:15.685
What?

14:15.685 --> 14:18.722
Yeah, we're on the way.

14:19.457 --> 14:23.566
A unit was dispatched to the Andrews' 
residence. Assault with a deadly weapon.

14:23.566 --> 14:25.499
A Mr. Parker called it in.

14:25.499 --> 14:28.918
You touch me again, 
I'll cut your pig heart out!

14:28.918 --> 14:30.636
Why aren't you in jail?

14:30.636 --> 14:32.190
Get away, you stupid bitch.

14:32.190 --> 14:34.810
I should wait till you're asleep 
and set you on fire!

14:34.810 --> 14:37.456
You better kill me, 
or I'll do you without leaving a mark!

14:37.456 --> 14:39.469
- You freak!
- Hey!

14:39.469 --> 14:42.606
Look out!
Let's go. Come on.

14:42.606 --> 14:45.293
- Take it easy!
- Get off!

14:45.293 --> 14:46.955
- Take it easy.
- I'm taking her in.

14:46.955 --> 14:48.633
I don't think so. 
I've got it from here.

14:48.633 --> 14:50.064
- Okay. I'm all right. 
- Get off of me!

14:50.064 --> 14:53.588
Listen, this isn't helping you at all. 
Let's go, let's get up here.

14:53.588 --> 14:57.180
All right. Just take a breath. 
Calm down.

14:57.180 --> 15:01.425
- Why isn't he in jail?
- Calm down.

15:02.882 --> 15:06.473
You again. What is it this time? 
Or do you answer DIRs now?

15:06.473 --> 15:09.825
I'm going to need you to come on down 
and answer some questions.

15:09.825 --> 15:12.352
I think I need a lawyer.

15:12.352 --> 15:14.755
Yeah, I think so, too.

15:17.828 --> 15:19.246
You call this finesse?

15:19.246 --> 15:20.346
I've had calls from the brass...

15:20.346 --> 15:24.001
wanting to know did I orchestrate 
an undercover operation with SVU...

15:24.001 --> 15:26.048
and the press has already 
gotten a whiff of it.

15:26.048 --> 15:28.044
What kind of Mickey Mouse Club is this?
(디즈니 사의 어린이 TV 쇼)

15:28.044 --> 15:30.631
See, actually I hate that little, 
black rodent.

15:30.631 --> 15:32.636
Now, Dick Tracy, that was a club.
(유명한 만화 캐릭터로 형사임)

15:32.636 --> 15:35.275
You got this great decoder ring 
and a really cool watch.

15:35.275 --> 15:37.788
Are you going to say something, 
Ms. Cabot?

15:37.788 --> 15:39.530
- Like what?
- Protocol.

15:39.530 --> 15:41.934
Like, if you're charging 
a sergeant with rape.

15:41.934 --> 15:43.832
Like, if you would rein 
in your squad...

15:43.832 --> 15:47.052
and if you could be so kind as 
to keep us informed as to status.

15:47.052 --> 15:49.099
Very well.

15:49.099 --> 15:52.941
Charging Andrews prior to his making 
a formal statement is premature.

15:52.941 --> 15:56.290
Am I sweeping it under the rug, 
as you'd prefer? No.

15:56.290 --> 15:59.682
And I strongly advise you to discontinue 
obstructing this unit from doing its job.

15:59.682 --> 16:01.504
Or I will be more than happy 
to file charges...

16:01.504 --> 16:04.000
naming you and your partner 
as coconspirators.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.504
IAB is here, strictly 
in a supervisory capacity.

16:07.504 --> 16:09.010
Not anymore.

16:09.010 --> 16:12.369
You may consider yourselves 
officially updated.

16:25.322 --> 16:29.140
Let the record show that I will not talk 
to you without my lawyer.

16:29.140 --> 16:30.807
- Okay, interview's over.
- Yeah.

16:30.807 --> 16:32.934
All right. But maybe 
we should clear this up,

16:32.934 --> 16:35.386
so we can all get back to work.

16:35.386 --> 16:37.171
Your wife already told 
us what happened.

16:37.171 --> 16:38.406
So now we'd just like 
to hear it from you.

16:38.406 --> 16:40.633
- What did she say?
- That you raped her.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.421
Now, before you deny it, 
let's just sit down

16:42.421 --> 16:44.519
and go through the sequence 
of events.

16:46.031 --> 16:48.616
All right, fair enough.

16:48.616 --> 16:50.584
I've been working steady midnights 
for a while.

16:50.584 --> 16:54.377
I come home, I'm tired. 
Right away she starts in on me.

16:54.377 --> 16:58.175
- She swears that I got a piece on the side.
- And do you?

16:59.469 --> 17:03.548
Yeah, so? / So why do you think 
she'd accuse you of rape?

17:03.873 --> 17:06.443
It doesn't take a genius. 
And she's pissed.

17:06.443 --> 17:07.782
You know, it's always 
something with her.

17:07.782 --> 17:10.518
Either I don't love her, 
or I smother her.

17:10.518 --> 17:12.988
You guys figure it out, 
because she's driving me nuts.

17:12.988 --> 17:15.036
Divorce is a hell of 
a better option than rape.

17:15.036 --> 17:17.396
I did not rape my wife.

17:17.396 --> 17:20.598
And he comes sauntering home 
like nothing happened.

17:20.598 --> 17:21.906
So why'd you stay there?

17:21.906 --> 17:23.191
Where should I go?

17:23.191 --> 17:26.672
It's my house, my things. 
I did nothing wrong.

17:26.672 --> 17:31.120
You cut him with a kitchen knife, 
and you threw a baton into the crowd.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.928
I was scared 
when he walked in like that.

17:33.928 --> 17:35.589
You know, I thought 
he was in jail.

17:35.589 --> 17:38.481
You got anybody you could stay with? 
Family, friends?

17:38.481 --> 17:41.508
You said you would arrest him. 
So what happened?

17:41.508 --> 17:45.634
I walked away. Things were getting 
out of hand. Tempers were hot.

17:45.634 --> 17:48.761
So what does that freaking cow do? 
She hurls a pot and nails me with it.

17:48.761 --> 17:51.536
But you didn't keep walking. 
You grabbed her and went back inside.

17:51.536 --> 17:52.731
I sure as hell did.

17:52.731 --> 17:54.673
So that's when you raped her.

17:54.673 --> 17:57.839
Nice try, but, no. 
I started packing her bags.

17:57.839 --> 17:59.035
That lease is under my name.

17:59.035 --> 18:01.514
I'll be damned if I let her run me 
out of my house...

18:01.514 --> 18:03.364
screaming, threatening me 
with kitchen utensils.

18:03.364 --> 18:05.737
What does that mean? 
Threatening you with kitchen utensils?

18:05.737 --> 18:07.734
She came after me with a knife. 
I disarmed her.

18:07.734 --> 18:09.854
- And how'd you do that?
- Standard academy move.

18:09.854 --> 18:12.318
Come on, guys. Don't you get it? 
She's crazy.

18:12.318 --> 18:16.339
Patricia hasn't been right since 
we found out she can't have kids.

18:21.097 --> 18:24.003
And that's when our marriage 
started to go south.

18:24.003 --> 18:26.591
So why didn't you file for divorce?

18:27.295 --> 18:29.641
I love him.

18:29.641 --> 18:32.267
I want counseling.

18:32.267 --> 18:34.521
He won't go.

18:35.966 --> 18:39.397
But he'll have to after the trial, 
won't he? They'll make him.

18:39.397 --> 18:41.228
If he's convicted.

18:41.228 --> 18:42.811
We're not even sure we can charge him.

18:42.811 --> 18:44.692
Well, who gets to decide that?

18:44.692 --> 18:46.020
Her name's Cabot.

18:46.020 --> 18:49.573
So let me talk to her. She's a woman. 
She'll understand.

18:49.573 --> 18:52.072
- He raped me.
- We made love.

18:52.072 --> 18:55.373
Did you hold her down? Did you use 
a chokehold to control her?

18:55.373 --> 18:57.371
I don't touch my wife like that, ever.

18:57.371 --> 19:00.919
I know I could do some serious damage. 
Besides, I'm the guy with the battle scars.

19:00.919 --> 19:03.848
But you do know how to do her 
without leaving a mark.

19:03.848 --> 19:06.354
Isn't that right, Sergeant?

19:12.002 --> 19:13.731
It's your call.

19:13.731 --> 19:15.293
Cut him loose.

19:15.293 --> 19:18.046
We don't arrest him now, we send 
a message to every wife...

19:18.046 --> 19:21.238
that if she's raped by her husband, 
she'd better get beat up, too.

19:21.238 --> 19:22.593
What do you want me to do about it?

19:22.593 --> 19:23.658
Book him.

19:23.658 --> 19:25.259
Let a jury decide who they believe.

19:25.259 --> 19:27.822
I don't even have enough 
to get past the grand jury.

19:27.822 --> 19:31.073
- Alex.
- Walk him.

19:39.115 --> 19:41.151
- You have business here?
- Yeah, Captain, I do.

19:41.151 --> 19:43.377
- Is my sergeant pinched?
- That doesn't concern you.

19:43.377 --> 19:45.098
I don't know who you work for...

19:45.098 --> 19:47.507
but in my department we watch out 
for each other.

19:47.507 --> 19:49.413
Maybe riding the desk, you forget.

19:49.413 --> 19:53.967
Well, I enforce the law, and the only thing 
I ride is any hump who breaks it.

19:53.967 --> 19:55.432
Feeling wood for my buddy?

19:55.432 --> 19:57.758
I am now, cheap shot.

19:57.758 --> 20:00.730
Get out of my squad room before I lodge 
a complaint with your lieutenant.

20:00.730 --> 20:02.446
Who do you think sent us over here?

20:02.446 --> 20:03.517
Is he charged or not?

20:03.517 --> 20:05.851
He's free to go.

20:10.028 --> 20:11.990
Sarge?

20:21.205 --> 20:24.038
I want my wife charged with assault.

20:24.038 --> 20:28.840
- Lloyd.
- Right. Do it.

20:29.674 --> 20:30.979
How can he do this?

20:30.979 --> 20:34.684
I don't know, but I'll ask him. 
Count on it. Come on.

20:36.812 --> 20:38.914
Come on, let's go.

20:55.498 --> 20:57.241
You mind?

21:04.513 --> 21:08.058
I told Lloyd I would quit.

21:08.058 --> 21:09.330
Now's a good a time as any.

21:09.330 --> 21:10.333
It's a bad habit.

21:10.333 --> 21:12.347
Although, some are worse than others.

21:12.347 --> 21:15.168
My wife has some pretty foul ones.

21:15.168 --> 21:17.087
Thought you weren't married.

21:17.087 --> 21:20.436
My soon-to-be ex calls me 
often with requests for money...

21:20.436 --> 21:23.936
and updates on the status 
of our uncoupling.

21:23.936 --> 21:25.323
You hate her.

21:25.323 --> 21:27.394
That would make it too easy.

21:27.394 --> 21:30.261
We're not together anymore, 
but we still fight.

21:30.261 --> 21:32.701
Only now, I'm not there 
for the tantrums.

21:32.701 --> 21:35.617
So you bust my chops, 
because I remind you of her.

21:35.617 --> 21:39.189
No, I just don't like you.

21:41.343 --> 21:44.417
Well, at least you're honest.

21:44.417 --> 21:46.415
So what're you doing here?

21:46.415 --> 21:48.996
I came here to gloat.

21:49.713 --> 21:52.392
How're you holding up?

21:52.392 --> 21:55.054
I'm all right.

21:55.054 --> 21:57.344
A little worried about Lloyd.

21:59.357 --> 22:02.722
Never underestimate the generosity 
of women.

22:02.722 --> 22:07.645
My husband likes to work midnights, 
so he doesn't have to sleep.

22:07.645 --> 22:10.981
One time, I came home 
and Lloyd was in the kitchen...

22:10.981 --> 22:14.638
scrubbing his bullets in the sink...

22:14.638 --> 22:17.083
his gun laid out on a towel.

22:23.608 --> 22:26.040
Is there anything you need?

22:27.094 --> 22:29.606
Yeah.
네

22:30.488 --> 22:33.809
Would you drop by my house 
and check on my husband?

22:33.809 --> 22:37.282
Just make sure he's okay?

22:53.855 --> 22:56.824
"File number 248957.

22:56.824 --> 23:01.122
"People v. Patricia Eileen Andrews, 
assault in the first."

23:01.122 --> 23:03.780
We'll waive reading, Your Honor, 
and enter a plea of not guilty.

23:03.780 --> 23:06.192
The People waive bail and request ROR.

23:06.192 --> 23:08.691
You're feeling awfully generous, Counselor.

23:08.691 --> 23:10.862
The extenuating circumstances 
call for compassion.

23:10.862 --> 23:12.588
Well, those aside...

23:12.588 --> 23:15.294
the defendant exhibited 
a serious lack of control...

23:15.294 --> 23:17.604
towards police and emergency personnel,

23:17.604 --> 23:19.956
by tossing a baton into the crowd.

23:19.956 --> 23:21.466
It was an isolated incident.

23:21.466 --> 23:24.683
We do not regard the defendant 
as a danger to herself or to others.

23:24.683 --> 23:26.764
I assume defense counsel has no objection.

23:26.764 --> 23:30.308
None, Your Honor. If the People wish to 
do my job for me, who am I to argue?

23:30.308 --> 23:32.642
Well, however lightly our ADA...

23:32.642 --> 23:37.207
may take the endangerment 
of city personnel, I do not.

23:37.207 --> 23:40.697
$10,000 bond, post with the clerk.

23:43.114 --> 23:45.627
ONE POLICE PLAZA
WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 27

23:45.627 --> 23:49.167
Unfortunate mess, this Andrews business.

23:49.167 --> 23:51.653
- How's it going?
- Well, it's like pulling teeth.

23:51.653 --> 23:54.968
And I sure as hell could do without 
all the pressure that goes with it.

23:54.968 --> 23:59.124
I'm afraid it's business as usual. 
You'll sort it out.

23:59.124 --> 24:02.307
Actually, I called you down here 
on another matter.

24:02.307 --> 24:05.000
It seems that one of your detectives 
is filing a discrimination suit...

24:05.000 --> 24:07.310
against the department.

24:07.310 --> 24:09.298
Jefferies.

24:09.298 --> 24:11.599
Papers were delivered first thing 
this morning.

24:11.599 --> 24:14.516
Legal is going over the complaint 
for merit.

24:14.516 --> 24:18.985
And nobody's happy, 
and you want me to talk to her.

24:18.985 --> 24:20.896
Unofficially, yes.

24:20.896 --> 24:24.830
No one at One Police Plaza can talk to 
her without complicating the issue.

24:24.830 --> 24:28.062
Well, I don't see how I can do anything. 
She's angry...

24:28.062 --> 24:30.454
and I didn't realize 
how angry till right now.

24:30.454 --> 24:36.211
Prior to this dispute, did you have a good 
relationship with this detective?

24:37.178 --> 24:39.078
Yes, I believe I did.

24:39.078 --> 24:42.175
But now you're not so sure?

24:42.175 --> 24:46.101
Don, I don't think it's personal.

24:46.101 --> 24:50.301
She hasn't named in her suit, 
she just wants back in the field.

24:50.301 --> 24:53.931
Well, then, we have a problem, sir.

24:53.931 --> 24:57.230
Because I don't think 
we can fold on the issue.

24:57.230 --> 25:00.722
Well, talk to her as a friend.

25:00.722 --> 25:03.034
And if that doesn't work?

25:03.034 --> 25:06.454
Make it go away, Captain.

25:09.498 --> 25:13.014
Guess who just paid 
Patricia Andrews' bail? / Her husband.

25:13.014 --> 25:18.525
Got a call from a buddy in Processing. 
I smell a recant, Counselor. / Fine.

25:18.525 --> 25:21.389
Let's see how cute the sergeant plays 
it when I get him on the stand.

25:21.389 --> 25:23.845
I thought you were dropping it. 
Not enough for a grand jury.

25:23.845 --> 25:26.093
I was, until the sergeant had 
his wife arrested.

25:26.093 --> 25:29.663
He pays her bail, looks suspicious. 
That I can sell.

25:29.663 --> 25:32.707
I didn't know women got into 
whizzing contests.

25:32.707 --> 25:37.772
Invite Mrs. Andrews down for a chat. 
I think it's time we cleared the air.

25:39.227 --> 25:42.403
Did your husband or any of his friends 
on the force threaten you?

25:42.403 --> 25:45.875
No. I just don't want to go through with 
it anymore is all.

25:45.875 --> 25:47.186
What made you change your mind?

25:47.186 --> 25:50.302
My husband could go to jail over 
a misunderstanding...

25:50.302 --> 25:53.620
a petty marital spat. 
I can't live with that.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.956
Just seems strange you would change 
your tune so easily...

25:55.956 --> 25:58.845
after singing the he-raped-me song 
to anybody who would listen.

25:58.845 --> 26:00.039
I was mad.

26:00.039 --> 26:01.322
Wouldn't have anything to do 
with your husband...

26:01.322 --> 26:03.910
dropping the felony assault charge, 
would it?

26:03.910 --> 26:08.164
- No.
- Who paid your bail?

26:08.164 --> 26:11.090
He's a good guy. Really.

26:11.090 --> 26:14.358
According to you, your husband's 
a first-class arrogant jackass...

26:14.358 --> 26:17.396
who put you in a chokehold and took 
what no man has a right to.

26:17.396 --> 26:20.431
And he apologized for that!

26:20.431 --> 26:26.405
You know, all I ever wanted was 
for him to put himself in my place.

26:26.405 --> 26:30.438
You know, he's never really said 
"I'm sorry" about anything.

26:30.438 --> 26:32.243
This was genuine.

26:32.243 --> 26:35.221
What did he say exactly?

26:35.221 --> 26:38.280
He said:

26:38.918 --> 26:42.376
"I'm sorry I raped you, Patty.

26:42.376 --> 26:46.840
"It is unforgivable."

26:46.840 --> 26:49.645
And to give him another chance.

26:49.645 --> 26:55.138
- Those were his exact words?
- Yes.

26:55.945 --> 27:00.011
So you see why I have to 
drop this, okay?

27:00.011 --> 27:02.435
I feel like we're starting over.

27:02.435 --> 27:09.171
For the first time in our marriage, 
he's trying to feel my pain.

27:13.962 --> 27:17.494
You can't make me change my mind.

27:17.494 --> 27:19.822
I love him.

27:19.822 --> 27:21.393
He admits it...

27:21.393 --> 27:24.612
and you respond by trying to recant. 
That's not love, that's psycho.

27:24.612 --> 27:26.803
Think whatever you want.

27:26.803 --> 27:31.882
I'm not crazy enough to lose my husband 
just 'cause you want to believe me now.

27:33.346 --> 27:36.183
Can I go?

27:44.931 --> 27:47.868
Well, I can charge her with filing 
a false police report...

27:47.868 --> 27:50.993
but what I'd really like to do is charge 
her with felony assault.

27:50.993 --> 27:52.920
You just want to put somebody 
in jail, is that it?

27:52.920 --> 27:55.869
No. I want to force her hand a little.

27:55.869 --> 27:58.813
I don't see Andrews refiling just 
to make your day.

27:58.813 --> 28:03.337
He won't have to if we can find another 
witness to the attack.

28:03.337 --> 28:07.462
I heard them fighting 
so I called the police.

28:07.462 --> 28:09.218
I didn't see anything.

28:09.218 --> 28:11.123
We were told it was assault 
with a deadly weapon.

28:11.123 --> 28:15.504
The only way the dispatcher could have 
known that is if you told her so.

28:15.504 --> 28:18.146
Sgt. Andrews won't find out 
it was me?

28:18.146 --> 28:22.470
Not a word you say. 
Now, did you see the attack?

28:24.238 --> 28:29.696
She had a knife. 
She cut him.

28:29.696 --> 28:32.311
Assault two, Ms. Cabot? 
You're reaching

28:32.311 --> 28:35.198
Not at all.
Your client cut her husband.

28:35.198 --> 28:37.746
I've got the knife, her prints, 
and a witness.

28:37.746 --> 28:39.443
That's three years in Bedford Hills.

28:39.443 --> 28:42.426
And trust me, it is not the country-club 
setting it sounds like.

28:42.426 --> 28:43.898
What happened to compassion?

28:43.898 --> 28:46.001
Motive for the assault was 
fear of reprisal.

28:46.001 --> 28:49.959
She recanted, so it's moot, 
along with my compassion.

28:50.840 --> 28:54.102
Tell you what, I'll bump 
it down to assault three.

28:54.102 --> 28:55.941
That'll shave 18 months.

28:55.941 --> 28:58.196
What do you want?

28:58.196 --> 29:01.131
I want an indictment for rape 
in the first degree...

29:01.131 --> 29:02.325
and the only way I'm going to get it,

29:02.325 --> 29:05.556
is with your client 
in front of a grand jury.

29:06.827 --> 29:09.815
This is blackmail.

29:09.815 --> 29:13.353
No, Mrs. Andrews, it's the law.

29:15.773 --> 29:19.227
MANHATTAN SOUTH
HOMICIDE TASK FORCE
4TH PRECINCT
THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 28

29:24.884 --> 29:26.751
We're busy.

29:26.751 --> 29:29.537
In my pocket is a warrant 
for your arrest.

29:30.407 --> 29:33.481
Don't make me Mirandize 
and cuff you in here.

29:44.228 --> 29:46.021
- Hold this for me.
- What the hell is going on here?

29:46.021 --> 29:49.065
- I thought this was settled.
- Evidently not.

29:49.065 --> 29:51.762
You want to get out of my way?

29:57.688 --> 29:59.777
Thanks, buddy.

30:10.761 --> 30:14.529
"File number 25527. 
People v. Lloyd David Andrews.

30:14.529 --> 30:16.228
"One count of rape in the first degree...

30:16.228 --> 30:18.535
"one count of sexual misconduct 
in the first degree...

30:18.535 --> 30:21.235
"and one count of sexual abuse."

30:21.235 --> 30:22.657
How do you plead?

30:22.657 --> 30:24.069
Not guilty, Your Honor.

30:24.069 --> 30:27.233
The People ask 
that bail be set at $50,000.

30:27.233 --> 30:29.934
- What?
- Quiet!

30:30.685 --> 30:34.246
This is a venal attempt to further smear 
my client who has ties to the community.

30:34.246 --> 30:36.500
He's a respected member 
of New York's finest...

30:36.500 --> 30:40.494
and would like nothing but his day in court 
to answer these specious accusations.

30:40.494 --> 30:42.827
We ask that he be remanded under 
his own recognizance.

30:42.827 --> 30:44.364
Your Honor, this is a heinous crime.

30:44.364 --> 30:46.090
The People are not prepared 
to send the message...

30:46.090 --> 30:48.844
that officers of the law 
get a free ride.

30:48.844 --> 30:54.297
You are not a messenger, Ms. Cabot. 
So save your button-pushing for the trial.

30:54.297 --> 30:58.468
Enter a plea of not guilty, and since the 
defendant is not a flight-risk, he's ROR.

30:58.468 --> 31:00.172
Your Honor, the People ask 
for an order of protection...

31:00.172 --> 31:02.468
and that the defendant surrender 
all weapons.

31:02.468 --> 31:04.611
So ordered.

31:07.719 --> 31:09.532
Let's talk.

31:13.915 --> 31:16.202
Sex abuse one, three years.

31:16.202 --> 31:17.403
Let's not fight.

31:17.403 --> 31:19.427
Submit your congratulations 
and be done with it.

31:19.427 --> 31:22.431
Don't be hasty, Sam. I'm offering to 
drop this to a D felony.

31:22.431 --> 31:25.535
You obviously don't gamble. 
You don't fold a winning hand.

31:25.535 --> 31:27.571
My guy's walking away 
from this unscathed.

31:27.571 --> 31:29.424
I'm just trying to save us 
both some time.

31:29.424 --> 31:31.037
All you've got is a bitter wife.

31:31.037 --> 31:33.172
You put her on the stand, 
the recant goes in the record...

31:33.172 --> 31:36.207
along with her witnessed 
physical attacks on my client.

31:36.207 --> 31:37.799
Why are you fighting this?

31:37.799 --> 31:39.347
Because he did it.

31:39.347 --> 31:42.203
And he doesn't deserve his freedom, 
and he doesn't deserve to wear a badge.

31:42.203 --> 31:43.726
When did he confess exactly?

31:43.726 --> 31:46.073
A few days ago, to his wife.

31:46.073 --> 31:47.723
Privileged. Where's your case?

31:47.723 --> 31:49.102
In the courtroom, in front of a jury.

31:49.102 --> 31:52.145
Didn't I tell you, 
we're going bench, not jury.

31:52.145 --> 31:53.777
Come on, Alex, don't be a sore loser.

31:53.777 --> 31:57.992
Drop the charges and send the kiddies 
to counseling where they belong.

31:57.992 --> 32:00.071
No.

32:04.054 --> 32:07.007
For the egg on your face.

32:11.031 --> 32:13.314
ARRAIGNMENT COURT
TRIAL PART 26
FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 29

32:13.314 --> 32:15.962
Do you recognize this internal report, 
Det. Munch?

32:15.962 --> 32:18.464
Yes, it's the report of an interview 
I conducted with the victim...

32:18.464 --> 32:20.710
Patricia Andrews. 
You were present at the time.

32:20.710 --> 32:22.675
What was the purpose of the interview?

32:22.675 --> 32:26.307
Mrs. Andrews urgently wanted to drop 
the rape charges against her husband.

32:26.307 --> 32:28.843
Did Mrs. Andrews actually 
say her husband didn't rape her?

32:28.843 --> 32:30.603
No, she did not.

32:30.603 --> 32:33.310
So it's your testimony that the victim 
came into the precinct...

32:33.310 --> 32:37.426
to drop the charges and clear her husband 
but never refuted what happened, correct?

32:37.426 --> 32:40.503
She said that her husband sincerely 
apologized for raping her...

32:40.503 --> 32:42.994
and that was the first time 
in their marriage that he had done so.

32:42.994 --> 32:46.006
Objection. She said, 
he said, it's double hearsay.

32:46.006 --> 32:47.417
Exception to hearsay.

32:47.417 --> 32:50.210
Your Honor, the defendant admitted 
to the felony.

32:50.210 --> 32:52.091
It's a statement against a penal interest.

32:52.091 --> 32:54.637
Why would Lloyd Andrews, 
a 20-year vet on the Homicide Division...

32:54.637 --> 32:56.081
admit to guilt if he didn't do it?

32:56.081 --> 32:58.620
At the very least, 
the alleged apology is privileged.

32:58.620 --> 33:01.162
By telling it to a third party, 
it becomes hearsay,

33:01.162 --> 33:03.389
therefore, no privilege exists.

33:03.389 --> 33:06.392
The exception is granted. 
Overruled.

33:06.392 --> 33:08.403
Nothing further.

33:09.939 --> 33:13.976
You threw a pot from the stove. 
Was it still hot?

33:13.976 --> 33:15.911
No.

33:15.911 --> 33:17.829
I didn't want to hurt him.

33:17.829 --> 33:20.370
What happened then?

33:22.909 --> 33:25.594
Then he grabbed me 
by the back of my head,

33:25.594 --> 33:28.223
and dragged me into the house.

33:28.937 --> 33:30.716
Go on.

33:30.716 --> 33:32.963
Then we fought some more.

33:32.963 --> 33:35.390
Was it physical?

33:37.349 --> 33:43.695
I kept hitting him, 
and he'd push me back.

33:43.695 --> 33:44.852
And I'd hit him some more and...

33:44.852 --> 33:47.721
Did he rape you?

33:52.183 --> 33:53.218
I don't know.

33:53.218 --> 33:55.446
Didn't you say he slammed 
you against a wall...

33:55.446 --> 33:58.727
threw his arm across your neck, 
and squeezed?

33:58.727 --> 34:00.769
Didn't you state that 
you almost lost consciousness?

34:00.769 --> 34:02.930
Didn't you tell police 
that he pulled your pants down...

34:02.930 --> 34:04.861
removed your panties, 
and raped you?

34:04.861 --> 34:06.629
Is that the truth, Mrs. Andrews?

34:06.629 --> 34:08.860
I suppose.

34:08.860 --> 34:11.123
Yes or no?

34:12.257 --> 34:14.666
Yes.

34:14.666 --> 34:16.683
Nothing further.

34:18.266 --> 34:22.366
Mrs. Andrews, did you go 
to the police and recant?

34:22.366 --> 34:24.123
I did.
네

34:24.123 --> 34:27.661
And were you facing assault one charges, 
and did Ms. Cabot offer you a deal...

34:27.661 --> 34:30.315
- in exchange for your testimony?
- Yes.

34:30.315 --> 34:32.632
- Then why are we here?
- Objection.

34:32.632 --> 34:34.001
Withdrawn.

34:34.001 --> 34:36.230
Mrs. Andrews, didn't you decide 
to drop the rape charge...

34:36.230 --> 34:38.838
after your husband dropped the assault 
charges against you?

34:38.838 --> 34:41.062
That's not how it was, you bitch!

34:41.062 --> 34:43.297
You're twisting everything around!

34:43.297 --> 34:44.694
Watch the language.

34:44.694 --> 34:46.784
In fact, didn't you suddenly 
have a change of heart...

34:46.784 --> 34:50.219
after having a long conversation 
with your husband?

34:54.234 --> 34:59.292
Answer the question, or I can arrange 
accommodations for you to think about it.

35:05.002 --> 35:07.794
Yes.
네

35:07.794 --> 35:11.091
We've been married for five years. 
And for the most part...

35:11.091 --> 35:14.789
we've been pretty happy, 
but lately it's been hell.

35:14.789 --> 35:18.480
How many times have the police been 
called to your residence?

35:18.480 --> 35:21.370
Four.

35:21.370 --> 35:23.892
My wife loses control.

35:23.892 --> 35:26.250
She's the batterer, Mr. Andrews.

35:26.250 --> 35:28.278
Why have you been protecting her?

35:28.278 --> 35:31.064
I love her.

35:31.064 --> 35:34.994
I couldn't see her get locked up 
over something that's my fault.

35:34.994 --> 35:37.418
She's the one who throws 
heavy objects.

35:37.418 --> 35:39.968
She grabs the knife and attacks.

35:39.968 --> 35:42.332
Why is it your fault?

35:43.017 --> 35:45.212
I haven't always been 
the best husband.

35:45.212 --> 35:49.005
I've cheated on her, 
I don't always come home.

35:49.005 --> 35:52.941
I wouldn't, either. 
Withdrawn.

35:54.510 --> 35:57.461
Did you force your wife 
to have sex with you? / No.

35:57.461 --> 36:00.838
Did you put her in a chokehold or in any 
way touch her with excessive force?

36:00.838 --> 36:02.358
No, I did not.

36:02.358 --> 36:04.978
Since the physical evidence bears 
witness to that...

36:04.978 --> 36:09.146
why would your wife accuse you 
of such a despicable crime?

36:12.487 --> 36:18.678
I had promised to cut off 
a yearlong relationship.

36:18.678 --> 36:21.656
I didn't, and she found out about it.

36:21.656 --> 36:25.461
But I've since stopped 
seeing the woman.

36:25.461 --> 36:28.742
I love my wife.

36:28.742 --> 36:34.378
Then why would you apologize for rape, 
if you didn't do it?

36:34.984 --> 36:39.862
My wife can't let anything go. 
She's got to be right, always.

36:39.862 --> 36:43.286
I'd rather lie and tell her that...

36:43.286 --> 36:44.690
I'm sorry for something
that I didn't do...

36:44.690 --> 36:46.372
than fight about it 
for the rest of my life.

36:46.372 --> 36:52.845
I just want some peace, and I don't know 
a husband in the world who doesn't.

36:52.845 --> 36:54.985
Nothing further.

36:57.504 --> 36:58.779
Mr. Andrews...

36:58.779 --> 37:00.777
did you or did you not 
tell your wife...

37:00.777 --> 37:04.449
you could do her 
without leaving a mark?

37:05.172 --> 37:06.337
That's not what I meant when I said...

37:06.337 --> 37:09.256
Let me remind you I can call 
any number of city personnel...

37:09.256 --> 37:11.580
who witnessed this statement.

37:13.669 --> 37:16.540
Did you or did you not threaten 
your wife with bodily harm?

37:16.540 --> 37:19.916
The heifer told me that 
she was going to torch me!

37:19.916 --> 37:22.574
What the hell was 
I supposed to say?

37:22.574 --> 37:25.841
That heifer is supposed 
to be the woman you love?

37:41.590 --> 37:45.011
Sexual misconduct, 
and he's out of a job.

37:45.011 --> 37:46.968
Don't be ridiculous.

37:46.968 --> 37:48.642
You haven't won.

37:48.642 --> 37:52.463
I'd say I've evened the odds considerably, 
or you wouldn't be here.

37:52.463 --> 37:53.889
Deal, Alex.

37:53.889 --> 37:56.522
At least concede that these two people 
should never be married...

37:56.522 --> 37:58.003
especially not to each other.

37:58.003 --> 38:01.552
- That's not my concern.
- Well, it should be.

38:03.298 --> 38:07.627
Hell of a railroad job on 
what he said in the heat of the moment.

38:07.627 --> 38:09.224
Got me thinking about the fights 
with my wife.

38:09.224 --> 38:12.115
What people might say.

38:12.115 --> 38:14.224
Sometimes I want to kill her.

38:14.224 --> 38:17.489
If she dies, 
then you've got a problem.

38:18.868 --> 38:22.133
D felony, still on the table. 
Three years, he'll be out in one.

38:22.133 --> 38:26.960
With a sex-offender tag dragging 
him down the rest of his life.

38:42.122 --> 38:45.148
You wanted to see me, Captain? 
So here I am.

38:45.148 --> 38:47.103
Have a seat.

38:47.103 --> 38:48.893
If you don't mind, 
I'd rather stand.

38:48.893 --> 38:52.558
I have a feeling I'm not going 
to like what I hear.

38:52.558 --> 38:56.990
It's not official. 
Just you and me.

39:00.889 --> 39:05.609
Now, I know these last couple of months 
have been difficult for you.

39:05.609 --> 39:07.486
I know you think we're the enemy.

39:07.486 --> 39:09.856
So this is about my lawsuit?

39:09.856 --> 39:11.729
Have you thought this through?

39:11.729 --> 39:14.980
The politics and the stink, how hard 
they're going to try to make this for you...

39:14.980 --> 39:16.471
has that crossed your mind?

39:16.471 --> 39:19.041
The only thing on my mind is 
the presumptuous attitude...

39:19.041 --> 39:20.092
about my private life.

39:20.092 --> 39:24.843
What I do on my own time, 
is not fodder for this department.

39:24.843 --> 39:27.489
This unit isn't like any other 
in the department.

39:27.489 --> 39:30.419
Not all the same rules apply, Jefferies. 
You know that.

39:30.419 --> 39:34.977
No. All I know is that 
when it hit the fan, you ducked.

39:36.358 --> 39:40.095
You're my responsibility, 
and you're an integral part of my squad.

39:40.095 --> 39:45.501
I did not agree with their conclusion, 
but I did agree that you need help.

39:45.501 --> 39:50.405
What does my personal life have to do 
with my work or the way I do it?

39:50.405 --> 39:54.177
The way I see it, it's the equivalent 
of you trying to eat your gun...

39:54.177 --> 39:56.772
and I can't let that happen.

40:06.147 --> 40:09.978
Then I don't think we have 
anything left to talk about.

40:20.461 --> 40:23.091
Will the defendant please rise?

40:27.441 --> 40:30.789
There is no doubt that spousal rape exists.

40:30.789 --> 40:34.092
There is no doubt that a wife holds 
the same protection under the law...

40:34.092 --> 40:38.091
from her husband and any other male 
acquaintance or stranger...

40:38.091 --> 40:40.713
with regard to her own body.

40:40.713 --> 40:42.928
But how does the law determine...

40:42.928 --> 40:46.133
if a rape actually occurred 
within a relationship...

40:46.133 --> 40:49.153
defined by its very nature...

40:49.153 --> 40:52.343
as normal sexual intimacy?

40:52.343 --> 40:56.020
Unfortunately, it cannot.

40:56.020 --> 41:01.156
Nor should it, save corroboration 
or grievous injury.

41:01.156 --> 41:04.562
Therefore, in the matter 
of the People v. Lloyd David Andrews...

41:04.562 --> 41:07.124
the Defendant is hereby found...

41:07.124 --> 41:10.720
not guilty of one count of rape 
in the first degree...

41:10.720 --> 41:14.880
not guilty, one count of 
sexual misconduct in the first degree...

41:14.880 --> 41:18.266
not guilty, one count of sexual abuse.

41:18.266 --> 41:21.093
The defendant is free to go.

41:32.340 --> 41:34.709
Well, that was a colossal 
waste of time.

41:34.709 --> 41:36.273
I couldn't disagree more.

41:36.273 --> 41:38.853
Forget about the wasted man-hours 
or even the taxpayers' money.

41:38.853 --> 41:40.944
You lost. 
Where's the victory in that?

41:40.944 --> 41:44.740
I'm the only ADA to get spousal 
rape past the grand jury.

41:44.740 --> 41:49.665
I may not have won, but I changed 
the climate, so somebody else can.

41:51.783 --> 41:53.571
On the other hand, the only thing 
you may have proven here today...

41:53.571 --> 41:55.839
is that women are still chattel.

41:55.839 --> 41:58.371
Only if they want to be.

42:14.030 --> 42:16.510
That's a little premature, 
don't you think?

42:16.510 --> 42:20.758
I thought a narc hotshot like you would 
be worth at least 60 days.

42:22.164 --> 42:24.540
They're not mine, Captain.

42:24.540 --> 42:28.871
I guess Jefferies didn't want 
to leave her gun unattended.

42:32.637 --> 42:35.157
I'm sorry.

42:56.851 --> 42:59.330
Me, too.
