WEBVTT

01:38.110 --> 01:43.354
Ca Lu, half a click that way,
two-nine-zero.

01:43.444 --> 01:45.811
- I say we go right up the middle.
- Negative.

01:45.861 --> 01:48.857
One round flank up the hill, the
other one right through the swamp.

01:51.644 --> 01:54.650
Heads, you get the hill.
Tails, you get the swamp.

01:54.690 --> 01:56.648
Flip the motherfucker.

01:58.606 --> 02:00.853
- See you in Ca Lu.
- All right.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.951
Delta Two, what's your SITREP?
Over.

04:35.031 --> 04:37.118
What do you got, Gibson?

04:37.198 --> 04:41.403
Nothing, sir.
Delta One, Delta Two, SITREP. Over.

04:41.493 --> 04:43.700
Two-one, contact!
Contact way out!

04:54.278 --> 04:58.363
Cease fire! Cease fire!

04:58.403 --> 05:01.819
Go, go, go.
Let's get 'em!

05:01.859 --> 05:03.816
Come outta there!

05:03.866 --> 05:06.194
Put your hands on your head!
Get on your knees now!

05:06.234 --> 05:08.321
Come on!
Down, down.

05:08.401 --> 05:11.028
Come on out of there!
Now!

05:13.355 --> 05:18.359
How many you slopes are out here?
Huh? What's your unit? What's in it?

05:18.439 --> 05:21.356
Tuan, get over here!
Talk to these motherfuckers!

05:21.446 --> 05:24.232
Find out how many of them are here!

05:24.312 --> 05:27.818
Where are they? What's in it?
Talk to me, goddamn it!

05:38.226 --> 05:40.353
Aah!

05:55.685 --> 05:58.642
Two, this is One Actual.
Where are you?

06:07.351 --> 06:09.269
Uuh!

06:20.346 --> 06:23.722
Other side of the tree line.
I'm in the water unable to withdraw.

06:25.350 --> 06:30.803
Unable to withdraw! I'm calling
in a fire mission on this position!

06:33.890 --> 06:37.216
- Hurry up and drop that arty!
- They're all over!

06:39.763 --> 06:41.890
Go left! Get out there!

06:41.930 --> 06:45.176
Tell this man to get on that radio
and pull his men off Hodges.

06:45.256 --> 06:47.673
Tell him to break contact
and move his men north of Ca Lu!

06:50.510 --> 06:54.046
Tell him I ain't playin'!
Pull his men off Hodges now!

06:56.423 --> 06:58.551
I ain't bullshittin' with you.

06:58.591 --> 07:00.548
Either you call your men off
Hodges,

07:00.588 --> 07:03.255
or this motherfucker's
dead and you're next.

07:03.335 --> 07:06.711
Last warnin '!

07:10.716 --> 07:13.253
Uuh!

07:13.333 --> 07:16.799
Call your men off Hodges now!

07:16.839 --> 07:21.294
If he does, he can go.
He's got my word on that.

07:21.374 --> 07:25.459
If you don't,
I'll kill you where you stand.

08:21.323 --> 08:24.739
Two, this is
One Actual. You still with me?

08:31.201 --> 08:34.236
Crank off a pop-up
if you're still alive.

08:47.741 --> 08:52.116
You got a reprieve, you hear me?
You don't get to die today.

08:52.196 --> 08:54.523
"You got your "Hail Mary".

09:44.684 --> 09:49.938
Hey! It's the colonel
with his cover on!

10:04.890 --> 10:07.266
All right!
Make way, make way!

10:07.267 --> 10:10.843
- I guess the drinks are on me.
- All right!

10:10.893 --> 10:12.851
At ease!
Listen up.

10:14.599 --> 10:18.384
Ladies and gentlemen,

10:18.474 --> 10:23.138
the reason we're all here,
Colonel Hayes Hodges.

10:33.306 --> 10:38.590
He's calling it a career after
32 years of distinguished service.

10:42.346 --> 10:44.253
All right, all right.

10:45.382 --> 10:48.257
Colonel, we got you a gift
and a surprise,

10:48.258 --> 10:50.716
so don't act like
you're not coming up here.

10:50.796 --> 10:53.213
Speech! Speech! Speech!

10:57.797 --> 10:59.795
Speech! Speech!
Speech!

11:08.175 --> 11:10.083
Hey, my man!

11:17.085 --> 11:19.002
Good to see you.

11:19.082 --> 11:22.628
You damn well better be. I came
halfway 'round the world for this.

11:32.207 --> 11:34.124
Hey, get up here.

11:39.078 --> 11:41.036
Speech!

11:43.034 --> 11:46.410
The sword, Colonel.
You know the story, Hayes.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.286
Marine Lieutenant Presley O'Banion
defeated the Barbary pirates...

11:49.366 --> 11:51.584
on the shores ofTripoli
in 1805.

11:51.664 --> 11:54.750
Out of gratitude, the pasha
gave him the Mameluke sword.

11:54.790 --> 11:57.327
Marine officers have
carried one ever since.

11:57.407 --> 11:59.704
It's the symbol ofa warrior,

11:59.784 --> 12:02.701
and you are a warrior.

12:02.780 --> 12:06.366
The best I ever served with.

12:10.781 --> 12:13.198
This man's been riding a desk
for the past 28 years,

12:13.238 --> 12:15.785
but not because he wanted to.

12:15.865 --> 12:18.612
He knows how to fight.
It's in his blood. Ah-ooh!

12:22.987 --> 12:25.743
What are you
gonna do now, Colonel?

12:25.783 --> 12:28.740
Well, uh... Well.

12:28.780 --> 12:31.826
Heh! No more wars to fight,
no more trials to lose.

12:33.904 --> 12:36.990
So I expect I'll do
some teaching at V.M.I.

12:37.070 --> 12:40.156
I will recon the local restaurants
in a concerted effort...

12:40.196 --> 12:44.032
to find out what civilians eat.

12:44.072 --> 12:47.148
Of course, I intend to continue
serving my country...

12:47.238 --> 12:49.355
by honorably depleting
the trout streams...

12:49.445 --> 12:52.362
of the Southern United States
with my fly rod!

12:55.278 --> 12:57.196
That's about it.

13:01.111 --> 13:03.069
Let's get outta here.

13:07.813 --> 13:11.060
- I missed you.
- Yeah, I missed you too.

13:11.149 --> 13:13.397
How's the kid,
the smart Hodges?

13:13.477 --> 13:17.562
You know, he studies more than
any two people. I never see him.

13:17.642 --> 13:20.858
- You gotta fix that.
- Yeah.

13:23.025 --> 13:25.393
- Got my orders.
- Oh, yeah? What?

13:25.433 --> 13:28.849
Got command of the 24th
Marine Expeditionary Unit.

13:28.898 --> 13:33.064
- Special Operations capable.
- Congrats. Huh! Congrats.

13:33.103 --> 13:35.060
- Yeah.
- Outstanding.

13:35.061 --> 13:37.808
All I gotta do is lash
'em together, take 'em to sea.

13:39.266 --> 13:41.514
That's, uh... outstanding.

13:43.891 --> 13:47.726
You ain't missin' nothin', Hodge.
It's a whole new ball game.

13:47.766 --> 13:50.763
No friends, no enemies,
no front, no rear.

13:50.852 --> 13:53.140
No victories, no defeats,
no Mama, no Papa.

13:53.180 --> 13:56.306
- Yeah.
- We're orphans out there.

13:56.386 --> 13:58.553
It's funny, you know?

13:58.643 --> 14:01.260
One guy walks out through a swamp,
he gets to come home to a desk.

14:01.350 --> 14:03.677
Another guy drives up a hill
and he gets to still be doin' it,

14:03.767 --> 14:05.805
all over the flip
ofa goddamn coin.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.802
You know, that's...

14:10.220 --> 14:13.176
It's funny.

14:13.216 --> 14:16.632
You gave good service
to the corps, Hodge.

14:16.682 --> 14:20.637
To think otherwise
would be just plain crazy.

14:20.677 --> 14:23.803
- You'd have gotten your command.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

14:56.924 --> 14:58.882
What's up, John?

14:58.922 --> 15:02.338
Terry, we've been ordered
to the Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden.

15:02.418 --> 15:05.085
This comes straight down Second
Division through General Perry.

15:05.164 --> 15:07.082
The American Embassy in Yemen
is surrounded...

15:07.172 --> 15:08.670
by a crowd of demonstrators.

15:08.710 --> 15:10.129
The crowd isn't hostile,
but it's large enough...

15:10.209 --> 15:13.375
to spook their government
into pulling their security forces.

15:13.455 --> 15:16.751
Twenty-fourth Marine Expeditionary
Unit's gonna provide extra security.

15:16.791 --> 15:19.747
We're gonna baby-sit, Colonel.
Just show our presence.

15:19.787 --> 15:22.584
Remember, though, if it turns
hot, we're looking at an evac.

15:22.624 --> 15:26.000
We got an ambassador and his family
there. Let me run you through this.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.997
Here's your
potential L.Z.S.

15:28.037 --> 15:31.124
Marines at the embassy advise we can
gain entrance through the back way.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.791
Here's some stairs where you
can deploy your men to the roof.

15:33.831 --> 15:35.958
These are your
over-watch positions.

15:35.998 --> 15:38.205
I'll take them in
myself quietly.

15:38.245 --> 15:41.621
One platoon, TRAP team,
put everyone else on Ready Five.

15:41.701 --> 15:43.699
My thoughts exactly, Colonel.

17:08.897 --> 17:11.224
What's wrong, Mommy?

17:11.315 --> 17:13.682
The people are upset
about some things, darling.

17:13.771 --> 17:16.809
- Are they mad at Daddy?
- No, they're not mad at your daddy.

17:16.898 --> 17:18.806
Why are they yelling?

17:18.896 --> 17:23.231
They're trying to get attention
so that people will listen to them.

17:52.636 --> 17:55.513
Sir, state security analysts
are asking for an assessment.

17:55.593 --> 17:58.509
Assessment? We're getting the hell
out of here. That's the assessment.

17:58.599 --> 18:01.096
The Sixth Fleet marines
are in the air, sir.

18:01.176 --> 18:03.673
If they think I'm gonna
tough this one out, they're crazy.

18:03.763 --> 18:06.510
Tell Mrs. Mourain to start packing.
We're going home.

18:06.550 --> 18:08.797
Shall I indicate
we're ready to evacuate?

18:08.887 --> 18:11.174
Ask them where the hell
are those helicopters!

18:11.214 --> 18:13.052
The ambassador wants to know
where the choppers are.

18:13.132 --> 18:15.299
You heard me.
Where the hell are the choppers?

19:16.497 --> 19:18.704
Lock and load!
Lock and load!

19:18.744 --> 19:21.121
Lock and load!
Lock and load!

20:28.482 --> 20:32.237
We're gonna
take a betterlookbefore we go in.

20:46.191 --> 20:49.976
Wagon Wheel, this is Red Man.
I'm over the embassy.

20:50.066 --> 20:52.983
This ain 't no baby-sit.
It's ugly down there.

20:53.023 --> 20:54.940
Red Man, Wagon Wheel.

20:54.980 --> 20:56.898
Roger that.
Let's go for the evac.

20:56.938 --> 20:59.974
Put it on deck.
We're going in the north side.

22:02.171 --> 22:05.427
There! Go!

22:08.094 --> 22:10.012
- Captain Lee!
- Yes, sir!

22:10.051 --> 22:13.178
Nobody comes over those walls
or through those gates. Nobody!

22:13.258 --> 22:17.003
One Alpha, secure all entries.
Tango and Bravo, on the walls!

22:17.093 --> 22:21.128
- Move, move, move!
- Last man! Last man!

22:22.716 --> 22:26.003
Pull back! Pull back!

22:31.836 --> 22:33.873
Take cover!

22:39.337 --> 22:42.503
You speak English?
- Yes!

22:42.543 --> 22:46.129
Where's the ambassador?
He's topside! Go topside!

22:51.123 --> 22:55.288
Take that corner!
Take that side! Move!

23:01.910 --> 23:03.788
Aah!

23:04.877 --> 23:07.374
Move, move, move!
Go, go!

23:08.912 --> 23:11.249
Bravo Two, left!
Move, move, move!

23:11.329 --> 23:14.205
Incoming sniper fire!
Stay down! Stay down!

23:17.162 --> 23:19.369
Two blue, clear!

23:19.449 --> 23:22.416
- Who's Mrs. Mourain?
- I'm Mrs. Mourain.

23:22.496 --> 23:25.742
- Where's the ambassador?
- He's in there. Are we leaving?

23:25.832 --> 23:28.409
The helos are outside, ma'am,
but that's up to the ambassador.

23:28.489 --> 23:30.746
Stay away from
the windows, please.

23:32.324 --> 23:34.242
Duck! Ow!

23:34.322 --> 23:37.408
Aah! Colonel! Please!

23:39.575 --> 23:43.111
My God! Are the helicopters here?
What kept you people so long?

23:43.201 --> 23:46.278
We're ready to evacuate, unless you
want to stay and run the embassy.

23:46.367 --> 23:49.444
I want to go right... now!
We called hours ago!

23:49.534 --> 23:52.610
All right, sir, come to me.
Stay calm and come to me.

23:52.660 --> 23:58.153
- Stay calm. Come to me. Stay low.
- We're like targets!

23:58.233 --> 24:00.820
- We're sitting targets!
- Follow Sergeant Mac. Go!

24:06.274 --> 24:09.570
Come on! Down there!
Down there! Right there!

24:14.234 --> 24:16.941
Right there!
Down there! Down there!

24:39.854 --> 24:41.852
Go ahead, ma'am!

24:41.892 --> 24:44.808
Go ahead!
Go ahead, ma'am, go ahead!

24:44.898 --> 24:48.564
Come on, son. Come on!

24:48.644 --> 24:50.941
- What's your name, son? Justin?
- Justin.

24:51.021 --> 24:53.808
Come on, Justin! Come on!

24:53.897 --> 24:56.395
- Justin, what's that you got there?
- A flashlight.

24:56.474 --> 24:59.271
We're gonna ride in a helicopter.
Wanna bring that with you?

24:59.351 --> 25:03.097
- Huh? Come on. Come on!
- Mommy!

25:03.186 --> 25:05.893
Let's go, ma'am, go!
Go, go, go!

25:10.098 --> 25:12.845
All TRAP Unit six,
stay low, stay low!

25:12.935 --> 25:15.931
We got crap coming over the walls
and sniper fire at 100 meters. Over.

25:16.011 --> 25:19.387
Stay low! Sit tight,
sit tight, sit tight!

25:31.133 --> 25:34.100
Colonel, we got three marines hit!
One is K.I.A.

25:34.140 --> 25:36.757
One Alpha says they're gonna
try to breach the front gate!

25:36.847 --> 25:39.094
- Tell them to wait out!
- Roger that!

25:47.264 --> 25:53.007
Put the missus on board
first. Get in there, Mr. Ambassador.

25:53.047 --> 25:56.344
I'll personally recommend you...
Where's the belt?

25:56.383 --> 25:59.839
- I'll personally recommend...
- Hold it!

25:59.879 --> 26:04.883
Where are you going? What? Colonel!
Colonel, we can't wait here!

26:04.963 --> 26:08.130
Come on! Let's get out!
Come on!

26:14.342 --> 26:16.000
Let's go! Christ!

26:16.090 --> 26:17.049
We're leaving
in just a few seconds.

26:17.129 --> 26:21.923
Let's go! Why are we sitting here?
Why are we sitting here?

26:21.963 --> 26:25.339
- Sir, please! Look at me. Stay calm.
- Let's go!

26:56.452 --> 26:58.790
She's free, sir!
Go!

27:07.579 --> 27:10.156
Hope you know how
to fold this, sir.

27:10.206 --> 27:12.533
Thank you, Colonel.
I'll never forget this.

27:12.573 --> 27:15.410
Sir.

27:20.454 --> 27:22.412
Go!

28:07.149 --> 28:12.482
Krasevitch is hit!

28:14.690 --> 28:19.234
Corpsman! Corpsman!
Shit!

28:19.314 --> 28:22.061
Goddamn it!

28:22.151 --> 28:24.069
Fuck!

28:29.942 --> 28:31.859
Six, Red Man.

28:31.939 --> 28:33.857
Engage hostile targets
as they appear.

28:33.937 --> 28:37.393
Deadly force is authorized.
How copy? Over.

28:37.483 --> 28:40.060
Red Man, Trans Six Actual.
Negative, negative!

28:40.140 --> 28:42.856
Be advised, I have women
and children in my line of fire.

28:42.896 --> 28:45.723
I got snipers in the buildings
at 400 meters. How copy? Over.

28:45.813 --> 28:49.888
What is it about this order
you don't understand, Captain Lee?

28:49.938 --> 28:52.893
Sir, are you ordering me
to fire into the crowd? Over.

28:52.894 --> 28:55.601
Yes, goddamn it!
Waste the motherfuckers!

28:55.681 --> 28:58.598
Six out.
Engage! Engage!

28:58.688 --> 29:02.104
Open fire!

29:21.800 --> 29:25.426
Cease fire!

29:25.466 --> 29:27.593
Cease fire!

29:27.673 --> 29:29.761
Cease fire!

29:29.841 --> 29:32.598
Stay down! There may still be
snipers out there.

29:32.677 --> 29:34.755
Cease fire!

29:34.845 --> 29:38.590
- Cease fire, goddamn it!
- Everybody stay down!

29:38.680 --> 29:43.295
There may still be snipers
out there. Stay down!

29:43.345 --> 29:45.302
Get down!

30:41.836 --> 30:43.793
- Sergeant Mac.
- Sir?

30:43.833 --> 30:47.159
Contact all stations.
Mission complete.

30:47.249 --> 30:51.494
Launch medevacs.
Dead and wounded out first.

30:51.574 --> 30:53.492
Aye, Colonel.

30:53.582 --> 30:58.206
All stations, this is RedMan.
Mission complete.

30:58.286 --> 31:01.992
Move all medevacs to L.Z.
Howcopy? Over.

31:18.662 --> 31:20.120
The FBI. investigation shows...

31:20.200 --> 31:22.577
that all the bullet holes
in the embassy wall...

31:22.617 --> 31:25.654
came from directly across
the way, from the snipers.

31:25.744 --> 31:28.860
Any weapons or ammo found
among the dead or wounded?

31:28.950 --> 31:32.575
No, sir. Nothing.
However, intelligence suggests...

31:32.655 --> 31:35.073
this could have been
a terrorist operation.

31:35.112 --> 31:37.070
Any proof?

31:37.110 --> 31:40.406
This is a tape from
the embassy security system.

31:40.486 --> 31:42.943
- Want me to thread it up?
- No. I don't want to watch videos.

31:43.023 --> 31:45.400
I don't want to hear about
ammo casings in some building,

31:45.490 --> 31:48.906
'cause here I got
83 dead people...

31:48.946 --> 31:51.823
unarmed...
women, children, old men.

31:51.903 --> 31:54.030
Another hundred or so
critically wounded.

31:54.110 --> 31:58.485
Here I got an international
crisis of mega fucking proportions!

31:58.565 --> 32:00.482
Bill, you know there have been
regular reports...

32:00.562 --> 32:02.770
of a terrorist
plot against this embassy.

32:02.820 --> 32:06.146
This was a regularly scheduled
protest. It was every week.

32:06.186 --> 32:09.602
It was the usual bullshit about
American presence in the gulf.

32:09.652 --> 32:13.647
Have you looked at these?
I mean, I'm just assuming you have,

32:13.687 --> 32:17.482
since they're on the front page
of every newspaper in the world.

32:17.562 --> 32:20.359
It's not that the rest of the
world wants to hold us responsible,

32:20.439 --> 32:22.357
we are responsible!

32:24.314 --> 32:27.101
We can't even have
the appearance of a cover-up.

32:27.141 --> 32:30.187
That does not excuse us
from our duty, Mr. Sokal.

32:30.267 --> 32:35.231
We sent Colonel Childers in there,
and the mission went to shit.

32:35.311 --> 32:37.768
We can't go after the man
who carried out his orders...

32:37.848 --> 32:40.185
and ignore the people
who issued those orders.

32:40.265 --> 32:42.183
Childers ordered the slaughter...

32:42.263 --> 32:44.620
of innocent women and children.
Get that straight right now.

32:44.680 --> 32:46.019
I'll tell you
what we ought to get straight.

32:46.098 --> 32:47.936
We lost three
United States Marines.

32:47.976 --> 32:50.683
They lost 83!

32:50.763 --> 32:53.809
Now, are we gonna go to war
with Yemen over it?

32:53.849 --> 32:57.635
We're covering our ass all over
the Middle East right now, General.

32:57.685 --> 33:00.262
Because of your man's
hot headed miscalculation,

33:00.302 --> 33:04.557
we are in danger of losing embassies
in Saudi, Jordan and Egypt.

33:04.636 --> 33:07.343
We're in danger
of losing our presence...

33:07.433 --> 33:10.260
with every moderate
in the region.

33:10.350 --> 33:12.597
Now they're gonna scream
"cover up".

33:12.677 --> 33:15.923
The screaming will get so loud we'll
be sending Marines back over there,

33:15.973 --> 33:19.339
and the body count of American
dead is gonna be higher than three.

33:21.177 --> 33:24.882
I see where you're going
with this, Mr. Sokal.

33:24.972 --> 33:27.220
Will you be needing me
anymore today?

33:28.638 --> 33:30.636
No.

33:30.716 --> 33:33.053
No, that's fine, General.
Thankyou.

33:33.093 --> 33:35.220
Good day to you, sir.

33:48.425 --> 33:51.751
Where do you think
you're going with that?

33:51.841 --> 33:56.835
- You don't want to look at it.
- Nobody's lookin' at it.

33:56.925 --> 33:59.332
Why should the United States
be held responsible...

33:59.382 --> 34:03.257
for the actions of one man?

34:03.337 --> 34:05.714
What if the crowd had weapons?

34:05.794 --> 34:08.291
What if this shows
they did fire first?

34:08.380 --> 34:11.496
He could have fired over
their heads, this moron!

34:11.587 --> 34:14.204
Didn't he know where he was?
The Middle East!

34:14.254 --> 34:15.962
He could have isolated
on the snipers.

34:16.042 --> 34:17.540
He could have
avoided confrontation.

34:17.620 --> 34:19.917
He could have done
50 fuckin' things!

34:19.996 --> 34:22.295
Instead, he destroyed a fragile
trust, put his own men in danger...

34:22.373 --> 34:25.870
Fuck this guy!
Forget this tape.

34:25.909 --> 34:29.876
I don't want to watch it.
I don't want to testify about it.

34:32.243 --> 34:34.199
I don't want it to exist.

34:46.366 --> 34:48.454
Good morning, sir.

34:49.661 --> 34:51.620
Good morning, sir.

34:54.407 --> 34:56.324
Aye, aye, sir.

34:56.414 --> 34:59.830
As soon as it's time.

35:03.496 --> 35:07.281
General, Colonel Childers
reporting as ordered, sir.

35:07.321 --> 35:09.409
- Give us a minute, Skip.
- Yes, sir.

35:13.784 --> 35:18.738
Colonel, it's my duty to inform
you that you've been charged with...

35:20.655 --> 35:24.611
You know the drill.

35:28.157 --> 35:30.074
This is the Article 32
investigation.

35:30.154 --> 35:32.192
You're facing
a general court-martial...

35:32.282 --> 35:35.068
and charged with violation
ofat least three articles...

35:35.148 --> 35:37.695
everything from "breach of peace"
to "conduct unbecoming".

35:37.775 --> 35:43.648
But the bottom line... 83 counts,
violation of Article 118, murder.

35:43.688 --> 35:45.686
You issued an illegal order
to have your marines...

35:45.696 --> 35:48.942
fire into a group
of innocent civilians.

35:49.022 --> 35:51.399
Murder, sir?

35:55.354 --> 35:59.060
I'm the convening authority, so I've
gotta get this B.S. out of the way.

36:01.647 --> 36:04.434
Sign here, initial here.

36:08.359 --> 36:12.894
You're not a flight risk, so there
won't be any pretrial confinement.

36:16.979 --> 36:19.436
This court-martial convenes
in eight days...

36:19.476 --> 36:24.480
by direct order of
the national command authority.

36:24.520 --> 36:27.896
Do you want me to call
Bob Bennett or one of those guys,

36:27.976 --> 36:30.393
or do you want to go
with base legal?

36:32.980 --> 36:37.395
Terry, goddamn it,
we've been friends for20years.

36:41.220 --> 36:44.386
You want to tell me exactly
what the hell happened out there?

36:46.434 --> 36:51.178
I lost marines. The crowd
was hostile. They fired on us.

36:51.268 --> 36:54.764
They fired first, sir.

36:54.804 --> 36:57.721
I want you to know
I did everything in the world...

36:57.800 --> 36:59.638
to keep this from happening.

36:59.639 --> 37:02.425
It's just out of my hands now.

37:14.341 --> 37:16.299
Thanks a lot.

37:16.338 --> 37:19.005
When's the last time you
actually caught something here?

37:20.344 --> 37:23.130
Two years.

37:27.885 --> 37:31.131
- I really need your help.
- I'll help. Anything you need.

37:31.171 --> 37:33.548
You want me to take the stand?
I'll be a character witness.

37:33.628 --> 37:35.835
No, you don't understand
what I'm asking.

37:36.924 --> 37:39.921
I want you to be my lawyer.

37:43.836 --> 37:47.422
I'm a good enough lawyer to know
you need a better lawyer than me.

37:47.462 --> 37:49.379
'Sides that, I'm short.

37:49.459 --> 37:50.878
Two-nine plus one wake-up,
and I'm gone.

37:50.957 --> 37:53.085
You need one of those
Washington cats.

37:53.125 --> 37:57.250
I don't want some Starbucks
drinker who's never seen combat.

37:57.290 --> 38:00.546
- I need somebody who's been shot at.
- Yeah, I've been shot at.

38:00.626 --> 38:03.792
That's what I am...
a shot-up marine.

38:03.872 --> 38:07.498
As a matter of fact,
that's all the hell I am.

38:07.578 --> 38:10.205
No, wait a minute.
I'm also a weak lawyer.

38:11.293 --> 38:14.410
I'm a very weak lawyer...

38:14.460 --> 38:19.124
and the government is gonna come
at you with everything they've got.

38:28.413 --> 38:31.450
Major, Bill Sokal. It's a pleasure
to meet you. Come on in.

38:31.499 --> 38:33.457
Let me introduce you.

38:33.497 --> 38:35.455
Gentlemen, this
is Major Mark Biggs.

38:35.495 --> 38:37.662
He'll be prosecuting
the Childers court-martial.

38:37.702 --> 38:40.119
The marines put the major
through Stanford Law,

38:40.199 --> 38:43.655
and he owes them a couple of years
before he takes over the world.

38:43.745 --> 38:45.663
You know General Lowry.

38:45.743 --> 38:47.830
I'd like you to meet the general
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

38:47.910 --> 38:50.787
General West, and the secretary
of Defense, Mr. Wyatt.

38:50.827 --> 38:52.782
Have a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.

38:52.783 --> 38:56.620
What I gather from our esteemed NSC
advisor and secretary of state...

38:56.700 --> 38:58.867
is that we've got a trial
in two weeks.

38:58.947 --> 39:02.243
- Seems awfully damned fast.
- Everyone in this room will agree...

39:02.323 --> 39:05.041
it's in the national interest that
this trial be moved along quickly.

39:05.110 --> 39:08.905
The Article 32 investigation
was complete and comprehensive.

39:08.985 --> 39:10.693
It all seems to point
in one direction.

39:10.783 --> 39:12.151
Has he got a lawyer yet?

39:12.241 --> 39:15.158
He's requested a military
attorney, Colonel Hayes Hodges.

39:15.198 --> 39:17.944
Second Marine Division, Lejeune.

39:18.024 --> 39:19.732
Any relation to
General H. Lawrence Hodges?

39:19.782 --> 39:20.941
His son.

39:20.981 --> 39:23.648
Larry Hodges was one of this country's
most distinguished officers.

39:23.738 --> 39:25.905
What do we know about
Colonel Hayes Hodges?

39:25.945 --> 39:28.362
He's a guy who got
blown apart in Vietnam,

39:28.442 --> 39:31.149
then went to Georgetown Law
and became a cynic.

39:31.189 --> 39:33.146
Is that about right, Major?

39:33.196 --> 39:35.314
He was 67th in his class
at Georgetown, sir.

39:35.404 --> 39:38.230
He doesn't take too many cases,
doesn't win too many.

39:38.320 --> 39:41.067
He apparently went through an ugly
divorce, had a drinking problem,

39:41.147 --> 39:45.692
retiring in two weeks.
- Can we guarantee we get this guy?

39:45.772 --> 39:48.319
Sir, if I may say something?

39:49.437 --> 39:51.525
I am not a hired gun.

39:51.605 --> 39:53.063
I accepted this assignment...

39:53.103 --> 39:55.480
'cause I believe in the merits
ofthe government's case.

39:55.520 --> 39:57.727
I am not gonna stack the deck
against this guy.

39:57.817 --> 40:00.644
I will try this case
on good evidence only.

40:00.724 --> 40:03.021
I'm glad to hear it.

40:37.221 --> 40:40.217
Hold your fire.

40:40.307 --> 40:43.513
Set that weapon down over here.

40:46.719 --> 40:50.465
We need
a couple of canteens up here.

40:56.548 --> 40:59.135
Party incoming!
- You can go.

40:59.215 --> 41:02.221
You can go, goddamn it!
Go on! Dee dee!

41:02.301 --> 41:05.717
Get the fuck out of here
before I change my mind!

41:10.551 --> 41:13.218
Looks like you're going back
to the world, baby.

41:13.258 --> 41:17.463
- Doc!
- Twenty meters out. Left!

41:17.503 --> 41:20.879
- Right there.
- Anybody else?

41:41.215 --> 41:43.173
I got you now!

41:44.751 --> 41:46.668
- Hey, buddy!
- Hi, Mom.

41:48.746 --> 41:50.664
He looks fabulous.

41:50.754 --> 41:52.621
- Happy anniversary, Mom.
- Oh, thank you. So good to see you.

41:52.671 --> 41:54.120
I wasn't sure you'd make it.

41:54.209 --> 41:56.167
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.

41:56.207 --> 41:58.794
- How's it feel to be retired?
- Um, crazy.

41:58.874 --> 42:00.452
Good. Oh, you look great.

42:00.502 --> 42:01.910
- Thank you.
- Well, come see Dad...

42:01.960 --> 42:04.208
- There he is.
...and all the family.

42:04.288 --> 42:06.785
Hello, sir.

42:06.874 --> 42:09.292
- Glad you could make it.
- Yes, sir.

42:14.955 --> 42:18.201
Good to see you, Hayes.
- How are you doing?

42:18.291 --> 42:21.657
Hey, kid. Hey, you.
Remember me?

42:21.747 --> 42:24.574
- The old guy who looks like you.
- Do I know you?

42:24.663 --> 42:27.121
- Yeah.
- Your voice sounds really familiar.

42:27.200 --> 42:29.747
Here's a clue. I was married
to your mom for about five minutes.

42:29.827 --> 42:32.914
- Really? You sure? 'Cause I don't...
- Yeah.

42:37.408 --> 42:40.495
- Well, is he guilty?
- Sir?

42:40.575 --> 42:43.032
Your friend Colonel Childers.

42:43.072 --> 42:46.328
- Guilty of what, sir?
- Come on, Hayes.

42:46.408 --> 42:50.033
You served with him. Is he the rabid
dog we've all been hearing about?

42:50.113 --> 42:51.861
I don't think
I should comment, sir.

42:51.901 --> 42:54.988
Come on, Dad. This is family.
You can lighten up a little.

42:55.067 --> 42:56.985
You know what we said
at the naval academy.

42:57.075 --> 42:59.992
Even if you thought
you weren't responsible,

43:00.032 --> 43:02.489
it went wrong
and you were there.

43:02.529 --> 43:04.316
Since when have you
not had a comment?

43:04.406 --> 43:06.154
Since Childers asked me
to defend him.

43:06.234 --> 43:08.032
No. Oh, Hayes.

43:08.072 --> 43:10.489
- What?
- Excuse me.

43:10.569 --> 43:12.856
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

43:12.906 --> 43:16.113
Why would you do that?
Huh!

43:16.152 --> 43:18.939
- Because he asked me, and I owe him.
- That's great.

43:19.029 --> 43:22.485
That represents everything
that's wrong with the military.

43:22.525 --> 43:24.483
Wisdom from the one person
in this family...

43:24.523 --> 43:27.729
who has not elected
to serve his country.

43:27.779 --> 43:29.736
Childers must have snapped.
It happens in combat.

43:29.776 --> 43:32.853
I've seen it.
I'm sure you have too.

43:32.943 --> 43:34.860
Thank you for reminding me...

43:34.940 --> 43:37.727
why we have the presumption
of innocence in America.

43:37.777 --> 43:40.683
What are you, Abraham
Lincoln? You can't hide behind that.

43:40.773 --> 43:42.651
The guy murdered innocent women
and children.

43:42.731 --> 43:44.769
- You hear that on television?
- And newspapers.

43:44.858 --> 43:47.395
- It's all over the place.
- It's Mom and Dad's anniversary.

43:55.855 --> 43:57.973
Don't take this case, son.

43:58.063 --> 44:00.810
This man has trashed
the reputation of the Corps.

44:00.889 --> 44:02.897
He's put us back 20 years.

44:06.932 --> 44:09.389
Is this how you want
to be remembered?

44:09.479 --> 44:12.136
I don't see how I can
turn him down. He saved my life.

44:12.226 --> 44:15.143
Well, I understand that
as well as anyone.

44:15.183 --> 44:20.137
But you don't repay him by
falling senselessly on a grenade.

44:20.177 --> 44:23.223
The way I see it,
this man should find himself...

44:23.303 --> 44:27.428
the best laywer in the country.
- Somebody better than me?

44:29.975 --> 44:32.053
The guy's a real marine, Dad.

44:32.133 --> 44:34.849
I mean, if they
can do this to him...

44:34.889 --> 44:38.215
just hang him out to dry...
they can do it to anybody.

44:38.305 --> 44:42.300
Forget that he's my friend.
They can do it to anybody.

44:42.390 --> 44:44.887
That means your medals
and your citations...

44:44.927 --> 44:47.884
won't mean jack shit
when they come afte ryou.

44:54.466 --> 44:56.713
At least two of his own guys
are gonna testify...

44:56.753 --> 44:59.550
that he didn't have
to open fire, sir.

44:59.630 --> 45:03.545
Nobody reports seeing any
weapons among the demonstrators.

45:03.635 --> 45:06.801
- His psych eval was a disaster.
- What about embassy footage?

45:06.881 --> 45:09.299
Cameras, film, videotape,
home movies, shit like that?

45:09.378 --> 45:14.462
No, I've subpoenaed everything.
The embassy got hit pretty good.

45:14.542 --> 45:17.918
Most of it was destroyed.

45:22.253 --> 45:24.670
Terry, you know Tom Chandler.
He's gonna help us prepare your case.

45:24.750 --> 45:28.416
Colonel Childers, good to see
you again, sir. Um, all right.

45:28.506 --> 45:32.381
First, we've subpoenaed all
the Article 32 investigator's notes,

45:32.461 --> 45:34.379
the State Department's
notes on Yemen.

45:34.459 --> 45:37.915
Major Biggs has already had
your head checked by their doctor.

45:38.005 --> 45:39.792
I've got you an appointment
with ours.

45:39.872 --> 45:41.920
- No.
- What?

45:41.960 --> 45:44.956
No more multiple choice
questions about self-esteem.

45:44.996 --> 45:47.714
We got the combat fitness reports.
He can forget the psych eval here.

45:47.793 --> 45:49.461
That's a mistake, Colonel.

45:49.541 --> 45:53.246
Listen, when I turned 18
I joined the Marine Corps.

45:53.326 --> 45:55.284
I asked to be in the infantry.

45:55.374 --> 45:57.791
- I asked to go to Vietnam.
- Terry.

45:57.831 --> 46:00.078
I live for the privilege
of commanding troops.

46:00.158 --> 46:02.665
I think it's the greatest honor
an American can have.

46:02.745 --> 46:05.372
You know how many birthdays
and Christmases I missed,

46:05.452 --> 46:07.370
spent rotting in jungles
or in the desert,

46:07.450 --> 46:09.367
just so you could play
war at ROTC?

46:09.457 --> 46:13.872
Childers! You gotta keep
your shit together here, man.

46:13.912 --> 46:16.369
Your court-martial board
is gonna be made up of people...

46:16.449 --> 46:18.866
who might've spent one day in
Grenada, maybe two days in Kuwait.

46:18.956 --> 46:21.363
They're gonna be beach boys who've
never been anywhere near combat.

46:21.453 --> 46:23.071
They're gonna be people
like Tom Chandler...

46:23.161 --> 46:24.869
sitting right here in front of you.

46:24.949 --> 46:27.995
That's who you're
making your case to.

46:28.035 --> 46:31.991
We don't have anybody
to back up your case.

46:32.031 --> 46:35.077
That's because
all my witnesses are dead.

46:36.825 --> 46:40.151
- Okay. So what happened?
- He lost it. He snapped.

46:40.241 --> 46:42.029
That's good.
We can snap him on the stand.

46:42.109 --> 46:43.737
This doesn't happen in a vacuum.

46:43.817 --> 46:46.234
Let's get a complete history
of Colonel Childers.

46:46.284 --> 46:48.861
Talk to every marine
he ever served with.

46:48.951 --> 46:50.858
My guess is
this has happened before.

46:50.908 --> 46:53.116
We have to be careful here.

46:53.195 --> 46:55.443
This guy is
the warrior's warrior.

46:55.533 --> 47:01.066
A Navy Cross, two Silver Stars
for composure in battle.

47:01.156 --> 47:04.153
He has no wife, no kids,
just the Corps.

47:04.232 --> 47:08.567
He was our best.
That's why he was sent.

47:08.607 --> 47:10.815
He's not on trial for the
good service he gave the country,

47:10.905 --> 47:13.362
but for what he did
on the wallin Yemen, period.

47:13.402 --> 47:15.319
Major, nobody wants to say it,

47:15.399 --> 47:18.396
but it occurs to me we're trying
to set an example here.

47:18.436 --> 47:21.312
So let's set it and show
the world we mean business.

47:21.402 --> 47:25.817
The first charge supports the death
penalty, and I say we go for it.

47:25.857 --> 47:27.685
No more death.

47:27.735 --> 47:30.452
I'll see that he never gets another
command and I'll put him in jail,

47:30.481 --> 47:34.107
but I will not seek death for a man
who served his country honorably.

47:34.187 --> 47:36.474
I don't want it
brought up again.

47:36.524 --> 47:39.730
We gotta show
Childers' state of mind.

47:39.770 --> 47:41.808
We gotta prove he went out
with intent to kill,

47:41.898 --> 47:44.145
and that is not going to be easy.

47:44.185 --> 47:46.812
Whether a man is charged
with murder or hailed as a hero...

47:46.892 --> 47:49.559
is sometimes a very thin line.

47:49.599 --> 47:53.764
Our case is this. Childers receives
orders that a regularly scheduled,

47:53.814 --> 47:57.479
I awful protest outside
our embassy in Yemen is unruly.

47:57.559 --> 48:00.436
He is to secure
or evacuate the premises.

48:00.476 --> 48:03.223
There has been no violence
prior to his arrival.

48:03.302 --> 48:04.761
Once there, Ambassador Mourain...

48:04.851 --> 48:07.478
does not feel the situation
warrants evacuation.

48:07.557 --> 48:09.885
- Childers ignores him.
- There was sniper fire.

48:09.975 --> 48:13.011
They draw fire from snipers
across the street.

48:13.101 --> 48:16.597
Childers retaliates into an unarmed
crowd in front of the embassy.

48:16.677 --> 48:20.642
A crowd of women and children.
He shot the wrong people.

48:22.260 --> 48:24.677
All right, here's what this means.

48:24.717 --> 48:27.304
Murder... Obviously, he could get
up to the death penalty.

48:27.344 --> 48:28.932
Conduct unbecoming an officer.

48:28.972 --> 48:31.759
Max is dismissal
with a dishonorable discharge,

48:31.799 --> 48:35.634
for feature of all pay and allowances
and confinement for one year.

48:35.714 --> 48:37.762
What about breach
of peace? What is that?

48:37.802 --> 48:39.879
Breaching the peace is minor.

48:39.969 --> 48:43.175
That means participating in an act
of violent or turbulent nature...

48:43.215 --> 48:46.421
that deprives the community of the
peace and tranquility it deserves.

48:46.461 --> 48:49.718
It's sort of the military equivalent
of the civilian misdemeanor.

48:49.757 --> 48:52.215
No big deal.

48:53.503 --> 48:56.669
There he is!
You goddamn baby killer!

48:56.709 --> 48:58.667
Baby killer!

49:00.125 --> 49:02.093
You're disgusting!

49:02.133 --> 49:05.379
I'm not answering any questions,
all right? Get out of here. Go away.

49:05.459 --> 49:08.755
You fucking baby killer!

49:08.835 --> 49:11.132
Fuck you!

49:13.090 --> 49:16.006
Who the fuck are you
to spit on this uniform? Huh?

49:32.457 --> 49:34.295
You ever play blackjack, Colonel?

49:34.375 --> 49:37.621
Not really.

49:39.079 --> 49:43.244
There are no intangibles.
It's all odds, sir.

49:43.334 --> 49:46.291
You know them, you'll beat
the guy next to you.

49:46.331 --> 49:48.748
You know what cards have been
played, you'll beat the house.

49:51.125 --> 49:54.791
Sometimes you just can't win
no matter what you do.

49:56.409 --> 50:00.284
I saw your man on television
knockin' some zit-faced kid around.

50:00.374 --> 50:02.491
You have to understand the kind of
pressure Childers has been under.

50:02.581 --> 50:05.448
A man with that kind of service...
No, no thanks.

50:05.538 --> 50:08.664
This was a rescue mission
that went bad. Nothing more.

50:08.704 --> 50:11.161
You're aware, Colonel,
we could ask for the death penalty.

50:11.241 --> 50:12.659
You're not serious.

50:12.699 --> 50:15.326
Oh, I'm very serious.
In fact, it's been suggested.

50:15.406 --> 50:18.782
What do you think would happen
ifa Yemeni killed 83 Americans?

50:18.862 --> 50:20.661
He'd have a trial
that would last for one day,

50:20.700 --> 50:21.988
and they'd take off his head.

50:22.078 --> 50:23.986
Have a seat, Colonel.

50:25.404 --> 50:27.322
Please.

50:33.115 --> 50:34.983
So here it is.
You plead him out. Guilty.

50:35.073 --> 50:36.781
He throws himself at the mercy.

50:36.821 --> 50:39.657
- We'll help him out at sentencing.
- How much help?

50:39.737 --> 50:42.234
I'm not about to promise you
anything, but I'd say...

50:42.324 --> 50:45.321
in the neighborhood of ten
to fifteen, out in seven.

50:45.401 --> 50:46.529
Major,

50:46.609 --> 50:49.606
do you know what the life expectancy
was for a second lieutenant...

50:49.656 --> 50:52.902
dropped into a combat zone
in Vietnam in 1968?

50:52.982 --> 50:55.439
I don't have time
for 20 questions, sir.

50:55.489 --> 50:58.145
Then what's all this shit about
the odds of winning at blackjack?

50:58.235 --> 51:03.070
You got time.
Take a guess.

51:03.110 --> 51:06.396
My guess is your man's going down
'cause he deserves to go down.

51:08.353 --> 51:12.818
I got a question for you, Colonel.
What happened at Ca Lu?

51:12.898 --> 51:16.314
The battle of Ca Lu, Vietnam.

51:16.354 --> 51:19.690
You were there with Childers.
Something happened. What was it?

51:19.770 --> 51:23.515
Fuck you is what happened
at Ca Lu, Biggs.

51:24.604 --> 51:26.522
Two weeks.

51:26.602 --> 51:28.020
Life expectancy of
a second lieutenant...

51:28.060 --> 51:30.607
in combat in Vietnam
was two weeks.

51:30.647 --> 51:32.065
Sir, I need more time
to prepare this case.

51:32.145 --> 51:34.353
I need your permission
to go to Yemen...

51:34.433 --> 51:38.018
It's all here, Hodge. We did an
exhaustive Article 32 investigation.

51:38.058 --> 51:40.645
This thing happened
3,000 miles away. I need more time.

51:40.685 --> 51:42.393
Colonel, it's all here.

51:42.473 --> 51:44.640
We had it brought from Yemen,
and it's not unusual to convene...

51:44.680 --> 51:46.638
a court-martial
on short notice.

51:46.728 --> 51:50.304
There could be witnesses, something
the investigators overlooked, sir.

51:50.394 --> 51:53.350
Don't you think Colonel Childers
is entitled all consideration?

51:53.390 --> 51:57.305
Colonel Hodges, I don't care
ifyougo to China.

51:57.345 --> 51:59.303
We have our marching orders,
and this court-martial...

51:59.393 --> 52:01.261
will convene
at 0900 a week Monday.

52:01.351 --> 52:04.427
- Now, is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

52:07.883 --> 52:10.550
One! Two!

52:20.258 --> 52:24.713
contact the sergeant?
- He's off-base, sir.

52:34.881 --> 52:36.799
Terry?

52:50.542 --> 52:52.460
Terry?

52:58.253 --> 53:00.211
Childers?

53:05.714 --> 53:07.792
Ohh.

53:07.872 --> 53:09.790
Oh, shit.

53:12.916 --> 53:15.123
It's okay.

53:15.213 --> 53:17.121
It's okay.

53:17.211 --> 53:19.498
- I wasn't...
- No, no. I know.

53:20.877 --> 53:24.792
It's okay. It's all right.
I know. Believe me, I know.

53:26.330 --> 53:30.126
Can I leave you alone
with that thing in the house?

53:30.205 --> 53:32.163
Yeah. I ain't goin' six
on you, Hodge.

53:32.243 --> 53:33.162
I'm goin' to Yemen.

53:33.242 --> 53:35.539
If I have to stick your ass
in a hospital till I get back,

53:35.579 --> 53:39.664
that is what I will do.
- You don't have to do that.

53:39.704 --> 53:41.832
Got your word on that?

53:42.910 --> 53:44.868
Oh, shit.

53:44.908 --> 53:47.575
They take my uniform away,
they may as well shoot me.

53:47.665 --> 53:51.830
You can live with it, bud.
Believe me.

53:53.078 --> 53:56.285
I'm not gonna shit you.
They offered us a deal.

53:56.325 --> 54:00.580
You plead guilty, it's
ten to fifteen. You're out in seven.

54:00.619 --> 54:04.495
- What do you think?
- I think they're out to crucify you.

54:04.575 --> 54:09.119
For a whole lot of reasons,
I say we take it and call it a day.

54:20.985 --> 54:24.401
I did what they
asked me to do, Hodge.

54:24.441 --> 54:27.857
I lost marines over there.

54:34.030 --> 54:36.737
If I'm guilty of this,

54:36.777 --> 54:41.781
I'm guilty of everything I've done
in combat for the last 30 years.

54:46.445 --> 54:48.403
I don't know.

55:31.102 --> 55:34.309
Colonel Hodges?
Captain Hustings.

55:34.388 --> 55:37.225
I'm not in uniform and I'm not
saluting because of the snipers.

55:37.265 --> 55:39.932
Please know that I'm saluting
on the inside.

55:40.012 --> 55:42.429
I've got some Kevlar back there
with your name on it.

55:42.469 --> 55:45.264
We're not the most popular team
in town right now, sir.

55:45.265 --> 55:47.093
Hustings, are you a wiseass?

55:47.183 --> 55:50.060
My mother prefers to
think of me as glib, sir.

55:50.100 --> 55:55.134
Very well then. You will most glibly
belay all bullshit and drive on.

55:55.224 --> 55:57.721
Roger that, sir.

56:19.046 --> 56:22.711
I've lined up some people who were
at the scene, as you requested, sir.

56:22.801 --> 56:25.048
- We can start tomorrow.
- Good.

56:25.088 --> 56:28.135
- All right. Here we are.
- Oh. 07:00.

56:28.175 --> 56:30.132
Roger that, sir.

56:50.249 --> 56:53.505
The old embassy was
a fifth century palace.

56:53.545 --> 56:54.663
Got pretty shot up.

56:54.753 --> 56:56.541
We're moving the newone
to a bunker outside the city...

56:56.581 --> 57:00.626
behind about a mile
of barbed wire, sir.

57:06.879 --> 57:09.086
- You want me to come with you, sir?
- Negative.

57:09.126 --> 57:12.083
Stay with the vehicle.
Meet me at the hotel.

57:12.084 --> 57:14.040
Yes, sir.

01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:56.696
Armed American marines,
they were shooting at his people.

01:01:56.776 --> 01:01:59.193
They were just trying
to defend themselves.

01:01:59.283 --> 01:02:02.319
Is he saying
the marines shot first?

01:02:07.653 --> 01:02:10.360
Why were your police officers
ordered to abandon the embassy...

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.397
on the day of the riot?

01:02:21.107 --> 01:02:24.483
It was a peaceful demonstration.
There was no reason to stay.

01:02:24.563 --> 01:02:27.360
After the killing, were
any weapons found in the crowd?

01:02:36.059 --> 01:02:40.314
No. They picked up everything
that was left. No weapons.

01:03:04.685 --> 01:03:06.603
Hey!

01:03:12.097 --> 01:03:14.763
No, look. Now, wait.
Wait a minute.

01:03:14.853 --> 01:03:18.020
Wait a minute, fellas.

01:03:23.263 --> 01:03:25.850
Hey. Hey!

01:05:14.621 --> 01:05:17.828
Hi. What's your name?

01:05:17.908 --> 01:05:19.825
Do you speak English?

01:05:19.905 --> 01:05:21.823
You're a very pretty girl.

01:05:21.913 --> 01:05:23.451
Katchi!

01:05:23.491 --> 01:05:26.238
Is that your name? "Katchi"?

01:05:26.288 --> 01:05:28.655
- May I help you?
- Yeah.

01:05:31.452 --> 01:05:34.029
I was wondering
what happened to her?

01:05:34.118 --> 01:05:38.114
She lost her leg.
Who are you?

01:05:38.154 --> 01:05:41.859
I'm a lawyer with the United States
Marine Corps. What happened?

01:05:41.949 --> 01:05:44.156
- A marine lawyer?
- Yeah.

01:05:44.157 --> 01:05:46.404
Follow me, please.

01:06:15.479 --> 01:06:18.935
There are hospitals like this
all over the city.

01:06:22.561 --> 01:06:26.107
Most of the people here
will die.

01:07:55.131 --> 01:07:58.797
Sir? Do you want
something to drink?

01:08:17.545 --> 01:08:19.502
Give me another one!

01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:23.587
Open the goddamn door!

01:08:37.082 --> 01:08:39.000
What's wrong with you?

01:08:39.078 --> 01:08:41.417
Get yourself a new lawyer,
you son of a bitch. You lied to me.

01:08:41.497 --> 01:08:43.743
I could not find
one goddamn witness.

01:08:43.783 --> 01:08:46.581
I couldn't find
one goddamn shred of evidence!

01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:48.828
Not for our side anyway!

01:08:48.908 --> 01:08:51.125
You clearly opened up
on those people. What were they?

01:08:51.205 --> 01:08:54.911
Rag heads, camel jockeys
or fucking gooks?

01:08:54.991 --> 01:08:57.037
- You through?
- Yeah.

01:09:00.203 --> 01:09:02.122
Get up.

01:09:02.162 --> 01:09:05.578
Come on. Get up. Come on.

01:09:09.743 --> 01:09:11.990
Look at you.
You went all the way to Yemen.

01:09:12.069 --> 01:09:14.238
All you proved is
you're still a drunk.

01:09:14.328 --> 01:09:17.073
You know what your problem is? You
never measured up to your old man.

01:09:17.154 --> 01:09:20.819
But I can't help you with that.

01:10:23.815 --> 01:10:27.191
Stop this shit
before somebody gets hurt.

01:11:00.682 --> 01:11:04.467
I lost every one
of my men at Ca Lu.

01:11:04.517 --> 01:11:07.304
And I'll tell you
the first thing I felt.

01:11:07.344 --> 01:11:10.640
Joy.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:14.515
Elation.
Gladto be alive.

01:11:14.555 --> 01:11:18.970
I was glad it wasn't me, and
I fucking hate myself for that.

01:11:26.671 --> 01:11:29.887
That wasn't your fault.

01:11:31.425 --> 01:11:33.633
We're in deep shit, bud.

01:11:33.673 --> 01:11:35.840
Yeah.

01:11:40.634 --> 01:11:43.092
It's fourth and 40, Hodge.

01:11:44.919 --> 01:11:47.626
I need a Hail Mary.

01:11:47.716 --> 01:11:50.383
How?

01:12:16.662 --> 01:12:19.079
Send him in.

01:12:32.084 --> 01:12:34.910
I just want to make sure
we're on the same page here.

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:37.707
- Off the record.
- Of course, Bill.

01:12:37.747 --> 01:12:42.491
Now, you didn't see any weapons
in that crowd, did you?

01:12:42.581 --> 01:12:45.198
Well...

01:12:45.288 --> 01:12:47.745
There was some shooting,
but I...

01:12:47.785 --> 01:12:51.580
couldn't be sure exactly
where it was coming from.

01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:55.076
Now, see, that's
gonna be a problem,

01:12:55.156 --> 01:12:58.572
because we can't get on the stand
and waffle about the charges.

01:12:58.662 --> 01:13:00.580
Waffle, Bill?

01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:04.245
In your mind, Childers
was responsible, wasn't he?

01:13:04.285 --> 01:13:07.072
I wasn't exactly there.
I had already evacuated.

01:13:07.112 --> 01:13:09.160
You have to remember
he saved my life and my family.

01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:10.578
This all happened after...

01:13:10.658 --> 01:13:12.056
Does that mean the United States...

01:13:12.076 --> 01:13:14.324
is gonna have to take the fall
for what he did?

01:13:14.363 --> 01:13:18.069
I don't understand.

01:13:18.159 --> 01:13:21.235
The investigating team didn't
find any weapons in the crowd.

01:13:21.325 --> 01:13:23.613
That's because they weren't
there until the following day.

01:13:23.692 --> 01:13:26.150
The Yemeni government
cleaned up the scene,

01:13:26.199 --> 01:13:28.866
but unfortunately that's
not something we can prove.

01:13:28.946 --> 01:13:31.613
Nor can I testify about it.
It all happened afterward.

01:13:31.693 --> 01:13:34.360
Yeah, but you can testify
about Childers' frame of mind,

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:37.067
his behavior
while you were there.

01:13:38.235 --> 01:13:41.691
He saved my life.

01:13:41.821 --> 01:13:44.438
Surely this will all come down
to what the tape shows.

01:13:44.488 --> 01:13:46.815
The tape's inconclusive.

01:13:48.353 --> 01:13:52.398
Hodges subpoenaed it,
of course, but, uh...

01:13:52.478 --> 01:13:54.776
it was a faulty recording.

01:13:57.233 --> 01:13:59.480
- I see.
- Do you?

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:04.025
If Childers isn't held
totally responsible,

01:14:04.105 --> 01:14:06.981
then the United States will be.

01:14:07.021 --> 01:14:09.768
And just guess...

01:14:09.858 --> 01:14:12.025
where the finger...

01:14:12.105 --> 01:14:14.273
is eventually gonna point.

01:14:15.641 --> 01:14:17.938
- Me?
- Where else?

01:14:20.016 --> 01:14:22.683
You should've known
this was gonna erupt.

01:14:22.772 --> 01:14:25.729
And if you didn't,
you were asleep at the wheel.

01:14:25.809 --> 01:14:29.515
Either way, your conduct
was inexcusable.

01:14:29.604 --> 01:14:33.350
Now, do you want to face a
congressional inquiry over this,

01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:35.477
put your career at risk?

01:14:37.185 --> 01:14:39.802
Think about it.

01:14:39.892 --> 01:14:42.219
Thank you, Bill.

01:15:50.209 --> 01:15:52.167
All rise.

01:16:00.247 --> 01:16:02.165
Be seated.

01:16:05.501 --> 01:16:07.668
Look closely at this picture.

01:16:09.746 --> 01:16:11.833
Why did a well-trained
fighting unit...

01:16:11.913 --> 01:16:15.249
have to slaughter unarmed
men, women and children...

01:16:15.289 --> 01:16:17.627
when their orders
were simply to protect...

01:16:17.706 --> 01:16:20.873
and if necessary,
evacuate the embassy?

01:16:22.291 --> 01:16:24.408
The answer is, they didn't.

01:16:24.458 --> 01:16:28.244
They were ordered to open fire,
and that order came from one man...

01:16:28.324 --> 01:16:30.541
Colonel Terry Childers,

01:16:30.621 --> 01:16:33.408
who stands trial here today,

01:16:33.498 --> 01:16:36.284
a day of sadness,

01:16:36.364 --> 01:16:39.491
a day when America has
to accept responsibility...

01:16:39.531 --> 01:16:43.905
for its failures and its
mistakes as well as its glories.

01:16:46.612 --> 01:16:50.737
We will show you that the accused,
through his mind-set and actions,

01:16:50.787 --> 01:16:53.194
ignored the rules
of engagement...

01:16:53.244 --> 01:16:55.951
and went far beyond
the scope of his authority...

01:16:55.991 --> 01:16:58.119
to intentionally order
the murder...

01:16:58.159 --> 01:17:01.694
of 83 innocent people.

01:17:09.865 --> 01:17:14.489
I was the last one to enter the
courtroom this morning. I was late.

01:17:14.529 --> 01:17:17.695
I was late because
I was in the head.

01:17:17.735 --> 01:17:21.691
And I was in the head
because... I was throwing up.

01:17:23.738 --> 01:17:26.195
And I was throwing up
because I don't know if I'm...

01:17:26.275 --> 01:17:30.031
able to handle this job.

01:17:34.196 --> 01:17:39.570
I believe that Colonel Childers
is innocent of these charges.

01:17:39.609 --> 01:17:42.396
I just don't know if I have what
it takes to make his case for him.

01:17:42.436 --> 01:17:46.022
I'm simply not on the same page
as Major Briggs, uh...

01:17:46.062 --> 01:17:50.227
Major Biggs here, as a lawyer.

01:17:50.277 --> 01:17:53.563
We all know that.

01:17:53.643 --> 01:17:56.060
So why did I take this job?

01:18:01.603 --> 01:18:04.939
I took this case because
Terry Childers told me...

01:18:05.019 --> 01:18:09.314
I would have done the same thing
he did if I'd been in his shoes.

01:18:09.354 --> 01:18:12.730
I took the case because I know Terry
Childers. His word is his bond.

01:18:12.770 --> 01:18:16.975
He told me he did
what he had to do.

01:18:17.015 --> 01:18:20.102
Now, I hope
I don't let him down.

01:18:23.228 --> 01:18:27.223
We sent Terry Childers out
on a very tough mission.

01:18:27.303 --> 01:18:29.810
And when it went bad,

01:18:29.850 --> 01:18:33.685
and he did everything he could
to save the lives of his marines,

01:18:33.765 --> 01:18:37.051
save the lives
of the embassy people,

01:18:37.101 --> 01:18:41.057
you turn around now and want
to blame the whole mess on him,

01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:45.801
send him to prison possibly
for the rest of his life.

01:18:47.469 --> 01:18:50.635
That's not fair.

01:18:50.715 --> 01:18:53.092
It's not right.

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:58.716
It is what made me sick
this morning.

01:18:58.806 --> 01:19:00.713
It was a large crowd.

01:19:00.803 --> 01:19:04.839
There was a lot of commotion.
The noise was very unsettling.

01:19:04.879 --> 01:19:07.136
But it was a peaceful crowd.

01:19:07.216 --> 01:19:09.843
That is, until Colonel Childers
arrived and prevented me...

01:19:09.923 --> 01:19:12.300
from pursuing
further avenues of diplomacy.

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.797
Did Colonel Childers
force you to leave the embassy?

01:19:14.837 --> 01:19:16.884
Yes. He charged in.

01:19:16.924 --> 01:19:20.170
He... started
pushing us around.

01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:23.427
He physically restrained me
from doing my job.

01:19:23.506 --> 01:19:25.504
What was his state
of mind at this time?

01:19:25.584 --> 01:19:27.252
He was in a fury.

01:19:27.342 --> 01:19:29.459
He was disrespectful
to me and my family.

01:19:29.499 --> 01:19:31.127
Oh, that's bullshit.

01:19:31.167 --> 01:19:34.084
It was almost, how should I say,
a murderous rage.

01:19:34.174 --> 01:19:36.082
Do you remember what he said?

01:19:36.171 --> 01:19:38.169
I remember he said
something like...

01:19:38.209 --> 01:19:40.796
diplomacy is bullshit
at this point...

01:19:40.876 --> 01:19:44.502
"and that ""nobody fucks
with the American flag""."

01:19:44.581 --> 01:19:46.999
- Those were his words.
- Thank you, Ambassador.

01:19:47.039 --> 01:19:48.996
No further questions.

01:19:49.046 --> 01:19:51.663
Do you believe...

01:19:51.753 --> 01:19:53.541
that an American embassy
on foreign soil...

01:19:53.621 --> 01:19:55.419
is sovereign
United States territory?

01:19:55.459 --> 01:19:57.416
As a general principle, yes.

01:19:57.496 --> 01:19:59.204
Do you believe Americans
have a right...

01:19:59.294 --> 01:20:00.932
to defend that territory
if it's attacked?

01:20:00.952 --> 01:20:02.870
If it is, in fact, attacked.

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:06.036
Would you have expected
Colonel Childers to surrender...

01:20:06.126 --> 01:20:08.124
to the attacking crowd
or to fight them?

01:20:08.204 --> 01:20:09.492
I would have expected neither.

01:20:09.582 --> 01:20:11.160
The colonel should have let me
address the crowd,

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:13.457
then he could have withdrawn
his marines.

01:20:13.537 --> 01:20:15.625
Would you have expected him
to hold his fire as he withdrew,

01:20:15.705 --> 01:20:18.991
even if he were taking casualties?
- To the extent possible.

01:20:19.041 --> 01:20:20.239
So your order would have been,

01:20:20.249 --> 01:20:21.997
Hold your fire to the extent
possible, Marines.

01:20:22.037 --> 01:20:24.534
And to the extent not possible,
fire away.

01:20:27.081 --> 01:20:28.989
Ambassador.

01:20:31.656 --> 01:20:33.823
This photograph is exhibit "C".

01:20:37.279 --> 01:20:40.076
- What is that?
- It's a security camera.

01:20:40.116 --> 01:20:41.534
Is it mounted
on the roof of the embassy...

01:20:41.574 --> 01:20:43.612
and pointed down to where
the crowd had gathered?

01:20:43.702 --> 01:20:45.909
- I would suppose so.
- Yes or no, please.

01:20:45.989 --> 01:20:47.907
Yes.

01:20:47.986 --> 01:20:50.783
- Is it in operation 24 hours a day?
- I suppose so.

01:20:50.863 --> 01:20:52.781
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

01:20:52.861 --> 01:20:56.237
Do you suppose there is a taping
system attached to this camera?

01:20:56.317 --> 01:20:57.865
- Your Honor.
- Colonel.

01:20:57.945 --> 01:20:59.363
- Yes.
- Where's the tape?

01:20:59.403 --> 01:21:02.319
It is my understanding
that if there were tapes,

01:21:02.359 --> 01:21:05.316
undamaged tapes, they'd have been
sent to the State Department.

01:21:05.406 --> 01:21:06.445
Undamaged tapes?

01:21:06.524 --> 01:21:09.821
Well, there was
destruction and looting...

01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:12.318
after the killing.

01:21:12.398 --> 01:21:16.483
As you withdrew, did you remember
to take the American flag with you?

01:21:22.695 --> 01:21:25.692
Did you remember to take
the American flag, sir?

01:21:25.732 --> 01:21:28.648
- Of course.
- Where is that flag now?

01:21:28.688 --> 01:21:31.695
I brought it home and returned
it to the State Department.

01:21:31.735 --> 01:21:34.521
It was shot to shreds,
wasn't it?

01:21:34.561 --> 01:21:36.479
By the snipers, yes.

01:21:36.569 --> 01:21:39.525
Yeah?

01:21:50.852 --> 01:21:52.979
Right! Go right!

01:21:54.228 --> 01:21:56.355
Goal!

01:22:04.476 --> 01:22:06.474
At ease, son.

01:22:06.563 --> 01:22:09.600
Let me see. Which one
of you people is named Justin?

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:12.556
- Let me take a guess. How about you?
- No.

01:22:12.636 --> 01:22:16.052
Then I'll have to make
another guess. I'll take, uh... you.

01:22:16.142 --> 01:22:18.559
How'd you know?
Are you in the marines?

01:22:18.599 --> 01:22:20.976
Yes, sir, lam.

01:22:21.016 --> 01:22:23.683
Go on in the house, kids.
There are sandwiches in the kitchen.

01:22:23.763 --> 01:22:26.809
Mrs. Mourain, I'm sorry
to bother you at home.

01:22:26.849 --> 01:22:29.516
- I'm Colonel...
- I know who you are, Colonel Hodges.

01:22:29.596 --> 01:22:32.513
- Is that your boy?
- Yes.

01:22:32.593 --> 01:22:35.639
Can I talk to you
a few minutes?

01:22:35.719 --> 01:22:38.675
I don't think
that's appropriate.

01:22:38.765 --> 01:22:40.673
I don't believe your husband
is telling the truth...

01:22:40.763 --> 01:22:42.880
about what Colonel Childers did
in Yemen.

01:22:45.298 --> 01:22:48.424
Kids, go on in the house.
There are sandwiches on the table.

01:22:48.464 --> 01:22:50.921
Let's go! Come on!

01:22:56.135 --> 01:22:59.011
You should take that up
with my husband, shouldn't you?

01:22:59.051 --> 01:23:02.257
Colonel Childers risked his life
so you could be here, ma'am,

01:23:02.337 --> 01:23:05.793
watching these kids play
out these windows.

01:23:05.843 --> 01:23:07.841
Does that bother you?

01:23:12.216 --> 01:23:14.922
I feel terrible about what
happened to Colonel Childers.

01:23:15.002 --> 01:23:17.250
Can you tell me that he
manhandled your family?

01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:19.917
Or that he prevented
your husband from doing his job?

01:23:20.006 --> 01:23:23.213
Ma'am?
Can you tell me that?

01:23:23.293 --> 01:23:25.250
No.

01:23:25.290 --> 01:23:28.297
As far as I'm concerned,
he behaved quite honorably.

01:23:28.337 --> 01:23:30.294
Will you testify to that?

01:23:37.336 --> 01:23:40.332
- My husband's a good man.
- So is Colonel Childers.

01:23:42.330 --> 01:23:43.958
I've been married for ten years.

01:23:43.998 --> 01:23:46.295
You're asking me to throw that
away in an afternoon.

01:23:46.375 --> 01:23:49.661
Your husband and you
and your son...

01:23:49.751 --> 01:23:52.997
owe your lives
to Colonel Terry Childers.

01:23:55.624 --> 01:23:57.912
We all have our priorities,
Colonel.

01:23:59.829 --> 01:24:01.747
I can subpoena you, ma'am.

01:24:03.455 --> 01:24:05.662
Please don't.

01:24:05.702 --> 01:24:10.656
Don't put me up there.
I'm a very credible witness.

01:24:10.706 --> 01:24:12.664
Now, if you'll excuse me.

01:24:12.704 --> 01:24:15.990
You won't tell the truth
if I put you on the stand?

01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:19.496
I don't know what the truth is.

01:24:19.576 --> 01:24:22.612
Colonel Childers is on trial for
what he did outside the embassy.

01:24:22.702 --> 01:24:24.990
I wasn't there.
Were you?

01:24:30.823 --> 01:24:32.571
Captain Lee, you were in command
of the TRAP team...

01:24:32.610 --> 01:24:35.367
and the second ranking officer
under Colonel Childers in Yemen?

01:24:35.407 --> 01:24:37.035
- Yes, sir.
- And you were on the roof...

01:24:37.115 --> 01:24:39.782
of the embassy, were you not?
- Yes, I was.

01:24:39.822 --> 01:24:41.860
Colonel Childers ordered you
to open fire...

01:24:41.949 --> 01:24:44.776
immediately after Sergeant
Richard Krasevitch was shot.

01:24:44.866 --> 01:24:47.033
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

01:24:47.073 --> 01:24:50.030
But Sergeant Krasevitch was not
shot by the demonstrators, was he?

01:24:50.110 --> 01:24:51.528
Objection. How could we know
the exact firing position...

01:24:51.608 --> 01:24:53.486
of the bullet that killed
Sergeant Krasevitch?

01:24:53.566 --> 01:24:56.113
Sustained. Counsel
refrain from leading the witness.

01:24:56.193 --> 01:24:58.240
Did you at any time...

01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:01.736
receive gunfire from within
the demonstration itself?

01:25:03.863 --> 01:25:06.690
Captain?

01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:09.147
I can't remember any fire
from the demonstrators,

01:25:09.187 --> 01:25:11.904
to my knowledge that is, sir.

01:25:11.984 --> 01:25:14.900
You killed the wrong people,
didn't you?

01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:17.647
You should've been firing
at the snipers across the way.

01:25:17.727 --> 01:25:20.064
- Isn't that correct?
- I can't answer...

01:25:20.144 --> 01:25:21.602
- Objection. Calls for speculation.
- Sustained.

01:25:21.692 --> 01:25:24.269
You shot at people who
were demonstrating peacefully,

01:25:24.309 --> 01:25:26.017
who were not using
deadly force.

01:25:26.067 --> 01:25:27.356
Your Honor, that's not
in evidence here.

01:25:27.436 --> 01:25:31.691
Sustained. Major, I'm not going
to warn you again.

01:25:33.309 --> 01:25:36.775
Captain, what were the words
Colonel Childers used...

01:25:36.854 --> 01:25:39.142
when he ordered you to fire
on the demonstrators?

01:25:39.232 --> 01:25:42.228
I don't remember
the exact words, sir.

01:25:42.308 --> 01:25:44.765
He ordered me to open fire.

01:25:46.523 --> 01:25:48.481
When you obeyed Colonel
Childers' order to open fire,

01:25:48.561 --> 01:25:50.478
did you believe it
to be a lawful order?

01:25:50.558 --> 01:25:51.597
Yes, sir.

01:25:51.687 --> 01:25:54.643
Otherwise it would have been your
duty to disobey. Is that right?

01:25:54.683 --> 01:25:55.762
Yes, sir.

01:25:55.852 --> 01:25:58.349
When your men opened fire
on the attackers in the crowd,

01:25:58.429 --> 01:26:02.184
did the snipers in the buildings
across the way cease their firing?

01:26:02.224 --> 01:26:04.222
Absolutely, sir.
It went completely quiet.

01:26:04.262 --> 01:26:05.391
It would seem, then,

01:26:05.431 --> 01:26:06.929
that the two groups were
actually one working together.

01:26:07.019 --> 01:26:09.805
Objection. Counselis drawing
a conclusion for the witness.

01:26:09.885 --> 01:26:11.553
Sustained.

01:26:11.643 --> 01:26:13.102
Were you in a position
to observe Colonel Childers...

01:26:13.141 --> 01:26:14.390
when everyone was evacuated?

01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:15.389
Yes, I was.

01:26:15.469 --> 01:26:17.426
What was the last thing
you saw him do?

01:26:17.516 --> 01:26:20.633
- He went to the flagpole.
- Then what'd he do?

01:26:20.722 --> 01:26:22.760
He took down the American flag.

01:26:22.850 --> 01:26:25.387
Was he personally
under heavy fire at that time?

01:26:25.467 --> 01:26:29.382
- Yes, sir.
- No more questions.

01:26:29.432 --> 01:26:32.548
Captain, prior to receiving orders
from the accused to open fire,

01:26:32.588 --> 01:26:35.385
where was the point of greatest
concern for the safety of your men,

01:26:35.425 --> 01:26:39.800
the crowd below or the snipers
in the buildings across the way?

01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:43.426
- I'm not really sure.
- You're not sure?

01:26:43.466 --> 01:26:45.423
Well, I guess...

01:26:45.553 --> 01:26:47.840
Don't guess.
I'll repeat the question.

01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:51.216
Was the point of greatest concern
the crowd below...

01:26:51.256 --> 01:26:53.713
or the snipers across the way?

01:26:55.212 --> 01:26:57.669
I would have to say
the snipers.

01:26:57.719 --> 01:27:00.625
Did you feel an immediate mortal
danger from the crowd as a whole?

01:27:00.715 --> 01:27:02.673
- I don't understand.
- You don't understand?

01:27:02.753 --> 01:27:05.799
- No, sir.
- Let me help you.

01:27:09.005 --> 01:27:10.623
Were you more worried...

01:27:10.713 --> 01:27:13.170
you'd be killed by these people
or by these people?

01:27:13.210 --> 01:27:15.797
I wasn't thinking about that.
Have you ever been under fire?

01:27:15.877 --> 01:27:19.623
You didn't see the crowd firing, but
you did take fire from the snipers.

01:27:19.713 --> 01:27:22.629
Is that correct?

01:27:26.754 --> 01:27:29.042
Yes.

01:27:29.371 --> 01:27:33.167
Our clinic is not too far
from the embassy.

01:27:33.247 --> 01:27:36.792
So I was one of the first
to arrive there.

01:27:36.872 --> 01:27:40.208
Did you see any weapons
on the bodies of the dead?

01:27:40.288 --> 01:27:41.916
No.

01:27:41.956 --> 01:27:44.913
Did you remove any weapons from
the people you were treating?

01:27:45.043 --> 01:27:46.081
No.

01:27:46.121 --> 01:27:49.457
Not a single weapon
anywhere among the victims?

01:27:49.537 --> 01:27:51.455
No, no weapons.

01:27:51.535 --> 01:27:55.580
In your opinion, is Yemen
a training ground for terrorists?

01:27:57.118 --> 01:27:59.416
Not at all.

01:27:59.496 --> 01:28:02.412
We met in Yemen.

01:28:02.452 --> 01:28:05.329
You encouraged me to tour
your clinic in order to witness...

01:28:05.409 --> 01:28:07.576
the suffering caused by
Colonel Childers' orders.

01:28:07.616 --> 01:28:09.953
- Do you remember that?
- Yes.

01:28:11.951 --> 01:28:14.787
I found an audiocassette
on the floor of your clinic.

01:28:14.867 --> 01:28:17.494
It's marked exhibit "R".

01:28:17.574 --> 01:28:19.742
Do you remember that?

01:28:23.237 --> 01:28:25.904
- Yes.
- I found another one...

01:28:25.944 --> 01:28:27.992
inside the embassy.

01:28:28.072 --> 01:28:31.618
In fact, I found several others.
They're all marked exhibit "R".

01:28:33.365 --> 01:28:36.442
Will you translate the writing on
the outside of that cassette?

01:28:38.899 --> 01:28:43.194
Declaration of Islamic Jihad...

01:28:43.234 --> 01:28:45.691
"Against United States".

01:28:45.821 --> 01:28:48.567
These audiocassettes are used
for the purposes of religious...

01:28:48.607 --> 01:28:51.903
and political propaganda due to
the high illiteracy rate in Yemen.

01:28:51.983 --> 01:28:54.151
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

01:28:54.231 --> 01:28:55.569
Will you translate
the words you hear...

01:28:55.649 --> 01:28:58.566
on this audiocassette
for the court, please?

01:29:10.352 --> 01:29:12.649
Dr Ahmar?

01:29:12.729 --> 01:29:16.734
We call on every Muslim
who believes in God...

01:29:16.814 --> 01:29:19.441
and hopes for reward...

01:29:19.481 --> 01:29:22.268
"to obey God's command".

01:29:30.188 --> 01:29:33.065
Dr Ahmar, does it say
what God's command is?

01:29:34.143 --> 01:29:36.431
To kill Americans...

01:29:36.481 --> 01:29:38.598
and plunder...

01:29:38.688 --> 01:29:43.103
"their possessions
wherever he finds them".

01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:48.187
- Go on, please.

01:29:50.264 --> 01:29:52.432
To kill Americans...

01:29:52.512 --> 01:29:54.849
and their allies,

01:29:54.929 --> 01:29:59.933
both civil and military,

01:29:59.973 --> 01:30:04.348
is duty of every Muslim...

01:30:04.388 --> 01:30:06.845
"who is able".

01:30:06.925 --> 01:30:11.639
To kill Americans is a duty.

01:30:11.679 --> 01:30:14.516
- Is that what it says?
- Yes.

01:30:20.179 --> 01:30:22.966
Do you recognize
the speaker's voice?

01:30:23.056 --> 01:30:26.472
No.

01:30:26.511 --> 01:30:29.428
Dr Ahmar, in your opinion,
is this propaganda...

01:30:29.508 --> 01:30:32.464
representative
of that demonstration?

01:30:32.554 --> 01:30:37.299
No. I'm not a member
of Islamic Jihad!

01:30:38.837 --> 01:30:41.384
The crowd was singing songs.

01:30:42.752 --> 01:30:45.209
I heard them from my clinic.

01:30:45.549 --> 01:30:47.796
What was your reaction when you
learned that Colonel Childers...

01:30:47.876 --> 01:30:49.544
had been selected
to lead this mission?

01:30:49.634 --> 01:30:52.631
I was very pleased. The colonel
had a distinguished record.

01:30:52.710 --> 01:30:56.466
- He's a nationally renowned war...
- How did you define his mission?

01:30:56.546 --> 01:30:58.464
We wanted to increase security,
but frankly,

01:30:58.544 --> 01:31:02.289
if things got threatening,
we wanted an evacuation.

01:31:02.339 --> 01:31:04.796
So you weren't looking
for confrontation?

01:31:04.836 --> 01:31:07.713
No, that's what we wished
to avoid at all costs.

01:31:07.753 --> 01:31:09.830
What was your reaction
to what happened?

01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:12.707
I was stunned,

01:31:12.747 --> 01:31:14.704
appalled.

01:31:14.754 --> 01:31:17.501
Wasn't the severity of the problem
at the embassy understated?

01:31:17.541 --> 01:31:19.748
Absolutely not.

01:31:19.828 --> 01:31:23.664
We operated on the information
we had at the time.

01:31:23.744 --> 01:31:27.669
I have here a State Department
report from Yemen.

01:31:27.789 --> 01:31:29.707
It's exhibit "M".

01:31:29.787 --> 01:31:32.873
Will you read the underlined
sections for the court, please?

01:31:32.953 --> 01:31:35.200
Certainly.

01:31:35.250 --> 01:31:40.204
'January25.
Grenade thrown at police car.

01:31:40.244 --> 01:31:45.957
January 27. Sixteen Western tourists
abducted by fundamentalist group".

01:31:46.037 --> 01:31:50.492
- Go on, please.
- "February 6."

01:31:50.572 --> 01:31:53.039
- A bomb explodes in a car...
- You got today's Post?

01:31:53.119 --> 01:31:55.037
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Give it to me.

01:31:55.117 --> 01:31:58.533
Stun grenade thrown at newspaper
kiosk near a police station.

01:31:58.662 --> 01:32:01.030
March 13.
A military officer...

01:32:01.119 --> 01:32:06.363
is seriously wounded by
Yemen's first... donkey bomb.

01:32:06.403 --> 01:32:08.910
Explosives were apparently
concealed under the saddle.

01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:11.277
Thank you.

01:32:11.367 --> 01:32:16.651
I have another State Department
document, dated 17 November.

01:32:16.741 --> 01:32:19.068
It's from the ambassador
to you.

01:32:19.158 --> 01:32:22.075
Will you read this
for the court, please?

01:32:26.489 --> 01:32:30.115
Dear Bill. Please, we must revisit
our previous conversation...

01:32:30.155 --> 01:32:32.793
in that the security measures we
have taken are still inadequate...

01:32:32.822 --> 01:32:34.740
"for the protection
ofour mission to Yemen".

01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:36.488
You have to understand that
when I received this letter...

01:32:36.528 --> 01:32:41.442
Thank you. Now, there are...
Well, are there... cameras...

01:32:41.522 --> 01:32:45.147
mounted on the roof of the embassy?
- Uh, yes.

01:32:45.187 --> 01:32:47.145
Are they designed
to observe and record...

01:32:47.195 --> 01:32:49.233
activities in the public spaces
outside the embassy?

01:32:49.312 --> 01:32:52.399
- Yes.
- Where are the tapes?

01:32:52.439 --> 01:32:55.275
Uh, it's my understanding
the embassy was looted.

01:32:55.355 --> 01:32:58.192
Maybe the cameras
were destroyed.

01:33:00.899 --> 01:33:05.483
This is a photograph.
It is exhibit "D" for the court.

01:33:05.563 --> 01:33:08.979
It's a picture of a camera
on the embassy roof.

01:33:09.059 --> 01:33:11.017
Does it appear to be damaged?

01:33:11.107 --> 01:33:12.685
No.

01:33:12.725 --> 01:33:15.392
- Where are the tapes?
- I don't know.

01:33:15.481 --> 01:33:18.188
Don't you think
the United States owes it...

01:33:18.268 --> 01:33:20.855
to Colonel Childers
for 30 years of service...

01:33:20.935 --> 01:33:23.182
to find that tape
and produce it here?

01:33:23.222 --> 01:33:25.100
Objection. We don't know
anything about any tapes.

01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:29.145
- This is pure speculation.
- Sustained.

01:33:31.013 --> 01:33:34.229
This is a shipping manifest.
It's exhibit "O".

01:33:34.309 --> 01:33:36.766
It is a list of items removed from
the embassy during the evacuation...

01:33:36.846 --> 01:33:38.434
and shipped
to the State Department.

01:33:38.474 --> 01:33:41.680
Will you read line six, please?

01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:45.686
Videotape from security
camera, VHS, one.

01:33:45.766 --> 01:33:47.224
You too busy to look at those
tapes or you just didn't care?

01:33:47.264 --> 01:33:50.260
Objection. He's badgering
the national security advisor.

01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:52.597
Sustained. Counsel,
please proceed carefully.

01:33:52.637 --> 01:33:55.095
- Where are those tapes?
- Objection! Asked and answered.

01:33:55.134 --> 01:33:58.510
Oh. Yes, right. Right.
Don't you think it's funny...

01:33:58.550 --> 01:34:01.347
that a tape that could exonerate
my client is missing?

01:34:01.427 --> 01:34:03.015
I don't think it's funny at all.

01:34:03.095 --> 01:34:05.552
Withholding evidence
is a very serious crime.

01:34:05.592 --> 01:34:09.348
- Objection.
- Sustained. Counsel, rephrase.

01:34:09.388 --> 01:34:12.054
Withholding evidence to frame
a United States Marine...

01:34:12.094 --> 01:34:14.342
is no less evil than charging
my client with murder.

01:34:14.382 --> 01:34:15.680
Where are those tapes?

01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:17.838
Colonel, I turned over all
materials in my possession...

01:34:17.928 --> 01:34:19.885
to Major Biggs.

01:34:19.965 --> 01:34:22.842
If those tapes showed a happy
crowd of peaceful demonstrators,

01:34:22.843 --> 01:34:24.799
we'd be looking at 'em.

01:34:24.839 --> 01:34:26.547
Objection, Your Honor.
This is contempt.

01:34:26.627 --> 01:34:28.885
Colonel,
this is your last warning.

01:34:28.924 --> 01:34:30.882
It was a new security system.

01:34:30.922 --> 01:34:33.050
The cameras were pointed down
at the crowd.

01:34:33.090 --> 01:34:35.507
Tapes were recorded, and those tapes
were sent to the State Department.

01:34:35.547 --> 01:34:37.215
Why are those tapes not here?

01:34:37.295 --> 01:34:40.341
Objection, Your Honor.
I've seen no such tapes.

01:34:43.707 --> 01:34:47.083
No further questions.

01:34:47.173 --> 01:34:49.091
There are no tapes showing
the crowd firing weapons?

01:34:49.171 --> 01:34:51.048
None that I'm aware of.

01:34:51.128 --> 01:34:54.005
And the government has turned
over all of its evidence?

01:34:54.045 --> 01:34:55.293
Of course.

01:34:55.373 --> 01:34:57.331
Colonel Hodges has gone
to some length...

01:34:57.421 --> 01:35:01.626
to have you read security reports
illustrating violence in Yemen.

01:35:01.706 --> 01:35:04.542
- Yes, he has.
- Here is today's Washington Post.

01:35:04.622 --> 01:35:06.041
Will you read these headlines
that I've underlined...

01:35:06.170 --> 01:35:07.958
from today's Metro section?

01:35:09.456 --> 01:35:13.662
Agent, kidnapper killed in
rescue of businessman's son.

01:35:13.751 --> 01:35:16.538
Bomb threat evacuates
Museum of Natural History.

01:35:16.618 --> 01:35:19.994
Officer chases truckdriver,
fires 38 times.

01:35:20.084 --> 01:35:24.039
Husband shoots wife,
himselfin street.

01:35:24.159 --> 01:35:27.245
Mr. Sokal, does this random,
unfortunate news mean we should...

01:35:27.325 --> 01:35:31.540
allow Colonel Childers and his
troops loose in Washington, D.C.?

01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:34.157
Don't answer that.
Thankyou, Mr. Sokal.

01:35:34.247 --> 01:35:36.534
Present arms!

01:35:38.532 --> 01:35:42.407
Order arms!

01:36:15.528 --> 01:36:18.824
Take deep breaths, sir! You're
almost out of here. Stay calm.

01:36:18.904 --> 01:36:22.110
I hope you know
how to fold it, sir.

01:36:22.190 --> 01:36:24.817
Thank you, Colonel.
I'll never forget this.

01:36:42.436 --> 01:36:44.234
Krasevitch is hit!

01:36:44.274 --> 01:36:46.022
Corpsman!

01:36:47.021 --> 01:36:48.979
Corpsman! Shit!

01:36:49.019 --> 01:36:51.106
Goddamn it!

01:37:16.686 --> 01:37:19.353
Engage hostile targets
as they appear!

01:37:19.433 --> 01:37:22.978
Waste the motherfuckers!

01:37:30.270 --> 01:37:33.766
Cease fire!
Cease fire!

01:37:33.846 --> 01:37:35.803
Cease fire!

01:37:39.059 --> 01:37:41.806
Order arms!

01:37:42.176 --> 01:37:44.553
I was proud of my marines.

01:37:44.633 --> 01:37:46.471
They showed
remarkable discipline.

01:37:46.551 --> 01:37:48.468
Why didn't you fire
at the snipers in the buildings...

01:37:48.548 --> 01:37:50.805
instead of at the crowd below?

01:37:50.845 --> 01:37:53.303
Because I believed we were
in greater danger from the crowd.

01:37:53.382 --> 01:37:55.680
- Was that crowd firing at you?
- Yes.

01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:59.845
The demonstrators in front of
the building were firing at you...

01:37:59.885 --> 01:38:02.721
in addition to the snipers?
- Yes.

01:38:02.801 --> 01:38:05.258
Why didn't anybody else
see that crowd firing?

01:38:05.338 --> 01:38:07.506
My men were
under cover on the roof,

01:38:07.596 --> 01:38:09.963
except for Krasevitch
who was on an observation post.

01:38:10.003 --> 01:38:13.259
And why isn't he here testifying
on your behalf today?

01:38:15.586 --> 01:38:18.922
Because he was killed in action.
He died in my arms.

01:38:18.962 --> 01:38:23.217
So you were the only man left in
a position to observe that crowd?

01:38:23.257 --> 01:38:25.714
Yes.

01:38:25.754 --> 01:38:28.211
Where else have you been
in combat, Colonel?

01:38:28.341 --> 01:38:31.128
Vietnam, Beirut,

01:38:31.208 --> 01:38:33.505
Panama, Persian Gulf.

01:38:33.585 --> 01:38:36.782
Can you identify that blue and white ribbon
on your uniform? It's the Navy Cross.

01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:41.705
Do you remember the citation
that accompanied that medal?

01:38:41.795 --> 01:38:44.502
For conspicuous gallantry in
the face of great personal danger,

01:38:44.582 --> 01:38:46.500
reflecting great credit
upon himself,

01:38:46.579 --> 01:38:48.747
"the United States Marine Corps
and the Naval Service".

01:38:48.837 --> 01:38:51.124
Your witness.

01:38:55.789 --> 01:38:58.036
Colonel,

01:38:58.126 --> 01:39:00.583
you gunned down
more than 80 people.

01:39:01.831 --> 01:39:05.956
You wounded
another hundred or so.

01:39:05.996 --> 01:39:10.701
Could this have been motivated
by a desire for retaliation?

01:39:10.791 --> 01:39:12.748
I was protecting my men.

01:39:12.828 --> 01:39:15.955
Sergeant Richard Krasevitch was
shot only a few feet away from you.

01:39:16.035 --> 01:39:19.041
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

01:39:19.121 --> 01:39:21.288
And right after Sergeant
Krasevitch died,

01:39:21.368 --> 01:39:23.286
you ordered open fire
on the crowd?

01:39:23.366 --> 01:39:26.282
- Is that also correct?
- I was taking fire.

01:39:26.322 --> 01:39:28.789
There were weapons
in that crowd.

01:39:28.869 --> 01:39:30.947
Well, you wouldn't shoot
unarmed people, would you?

01:39:31.037 --> 01:39:32.076
No, I would not.

01:39:32.116 --> 01:39:35.661
Even in the heat of battle, you
wouldn't shoot an unarmed person?

01:39:37.909 --> 01:39:40.536
No.

01:39:49.485 --> 01:39:51.652
This is exhibit "F".

01:39:51.742 --> 01:39:54.909
Will you please read
the following to the panel?

01:39:56.447 --> 01:40:00.072
Rules of engagement governing
ground conflict in urban areas.

01:40:00.152 --> 01:40:03.408
One. If possible,
the enemy will be warned first,

01:40:03.488 --> 01:40:05.406
then asked to surrender.

01:40:05.486 --> 01:40:08.482
Colonel, did you warn
the enemy?

01:40:08.572 --> 01:40:11.069
We arrived in helicopters.
We were standing on that roof armed.

01:40:11.149 --> 01:40:14.775
Did you warn them, either with shots
into the air or by a loudspeaker?

01:40:14.855 --> 01:40:17.612
Did you ask them to surrender?

01:40:17.692 --> 01:40:20.149
No.

01:40:20.189 --> 01:40:23.195
I'm sorry, no, you did not
warn the crowd?

01:40:23.315 --> 01:40:26.062
Yes. No, I did not
warn the crowd.

01:40:26.152 --> 01:40:29.318
Continue, Colonel.
You seem to know them by heart.

01:40:29.398 --> 01:40:32.144
Deadly force
is the last resort.

01:40:34.102 --> 01:40:36.110
- Go on.
- Three.

01:40:36.230 --> 01:40:38.607
When possible, try to arrange
for the evacuation of civilians...

01:40:38.647 --> 01:40:40.774
prior to any U.S. attack.

01:40:40.854 --> 01:40:43.101
Did you do that, try
to evacuate the innocent people...

01:40:43.191 --> 01:40:44.979
before you slaughtered them?

01:40:45.059 --> 01:40:47.936
Objection. That is inflammatory.
- Rephrase, Major.

01:40:48.016 --> 01:40:51.312
Did you try, following Section C
ofthe rules of engagement...

01:40:51.392 --> 01:40:56.685
for ground conflict in urban areas,
to evacuate innocent civilians?

01:40:56.765 --> 01:40:59.472
- No.
- No.

01:41:06.224 --> 01:41:08.641
Yeah, yeah.

01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:12.307
I just have
one more thing, Colonel.

01:41:13.595 --> 01:41:16.762
Did you have to repeat
your orders to Captain Lee?

01:41:16.852 --> 01:41:19.059
- I'm sorry?
- You ordered Captain Lee...

01:41:19.099 --> 01:41:21.226
to engage hostile targets,
and he advised you...

01:41:21.266 --> 01:41:23.224
that there were women and children
in the line of fire.

01:41:23.304 --> 01:41:25.262
- Is that correct?
- He couldn't see...

01:41:25.302 --> 01:41:29.267
Yes or no, Colonel? Didhe
follow your first set of orders?

01:41:31.424 --> 01:41:33.342
I don't remember.

01:41:33.432 --> 01:41:36.388
Captain Lee is on record
as saying he hesitated...

01:41:36.508 --> 01:41:39.095
and mentioned the snipers
in the buildings.

01:41:39.135 --> 01:41:43.220
- Is his testimony accurate?
- I don't remember.

01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:45.508
Let me get this straight.

01:41:45.597 --> 01:41:47.805
You evacuate the ambassador.

01:41:47.885 --> 01:41:51.880
You go back to the roof.
Two of your marines are K.I.A.

01:41:52.010 --> 01:41:54.297
A third,
Sergeant Krasevitch, dies.

01:41:54.387 --> 01:41:56.754
"You give your captain
an order which he doesn't follow;"

01:41:56.844 --> 01:41:59.461
in fact, he questions.

01:41:59.551 --> 01:42:01.629
And then you said what?

01:42:01.678 --> 01:42:05.464
I don't remember.

01:42:05.504 --> 01:42:07.002
You don't remember
what you said next?

01:42:07.092 --> 01:42:09.459
It was combat,
not some training exercise.

01:42:09.509 --> 01:42:10.798
A moment later,
your men were shooting.

01:42:10.878 --> 01:42:11.677
What did you say
to make that happen?

01:42:11.717 --> 01:42:12.675
I don't know.

01:42:12.715 --> 01:42:16.461
You must have said something.
Captain Lee reversed himself.

01:42:16.541 --> 01:42:19.627
- What did you say?
- I don't know the exact words.

01:42:19.707 --> 01:42:20.876
- Let me help you.
- Your Honor.

01:42:20.916 --> 01:42:22.963
You said, "Waste the motherfuckers,"
didn't you?

01:42:23.043 --> 01:42:24.541
- No, no, no.
- You didn't say it?

01:42:24.631 --> 01:42:27.588
- It all happened so fast...
- You're under oath, Colonel!

01:42:29.206 --> 01:42:31.463
Let me refresh your memory.

01:42:31.503 --> 01:42:34.290
This is exhibit "ry" a tape
recording made aboard...

01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:38.255
the U.S.S. Wake Island of all radio
communications received that day,

01:42:38.335 --> 01:42:40.912
including your exact words.

01:42:41.002 --> 01:42:43.209
Your Honor, with your permission
I would like to play this tape.

01:42:43.249 --> 01:42:45.167
If you got it on tape,
then that's what I said!

01:42:45.207 --> 01:42:47.794
They were killing my marines,
so, yeah, I said it!

01:42:47.874 --> 01:42:49.831
Waste the motherfuckers!

01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:52.958
- Are these "the motherfuckers"?
- Objection.

01:42:52.998 --> 01:42:54.246
- Overruled.
- Yes!

01:42:54.286 --> 01:42:56.793
- These?
- Objection!

01:42:56.873 --> 01:42:58.751
Yes!

01:42:58.791 --> 01:42:59.750
- These?
- Objection!

01:42:59.790 --> 01:43:01.288
- Overruled.
- Yes.

01:43:01.368 --> 01:43:03.036
Are these "the motherfuckers"...

01:43:03.116 --> 01:43:04.874
that you ordered to be wasted?
- Your Honor.

01:43:04.954 --> 01:43:06.791
- Major.
- Yes!

01:43:06.871 --> 01:43:10.617
The crowd in front of the embassy
had no weapons, did they, Colonel?

01:43:10.707 --> 01:43:12.365
Objection. We found
no snipers' weapons either.

01:43:12.415 --> 01:43:14.452
Yes, they had weapons!

01:43:14.532 --> 01:43:16.450
You think there's
a script for fighting a war...

01:43:16.540 --> 01:43:17.698
without pissing somebody off?

01:43:17.788 --> 01:43:19.696
Follow the rules,
and nobody gets hurt?

01:43:19.786 --> 01:43:22.243
Yes, innocent people probably died.

01:43:22.323 --> 01:43:24.241
Innocent people always die.

01:43:24.321 --> 01:43:27.237
But I did not exceed my orders!

01:43:27.287 --> 01:43:29.405
There are rules, and marines
are sworn to uphold them.

01:43:29.445 --> 01:43:32.910
I was not going to stand by
and see another marine die...

01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:35.198
just to live
by those fucking rules!

01:43:35.278 --> 01:43:38.244
Colonel!

01:43:43.028 --> 01:43:45.026
Your Honor, I request a recess.

01:43:45.156 --> 01:43:46.864
Major.

01:43:48.612 --> 01:43:52.068
The government is finished with
Colonel Childers, Your Honor.

01:43:52.158 --> 01:43:55.114
All right, Colonel,
you have your recess.

01:44:02.356 --> 01:44:04.153
Why didn't you tell me
what you said?

01:44:04.193 --> 01:44:06.650
- I didn't remember.
- "Waste the motherfuckers".

01:44:06.690 --> 01:44:09.068
That's brilliant.
You didn't think that was important?

01:44:09.108 --> 01:44:10.566
Why didn't you know
about the goddamn recording?

01:44:10.646 --> 01:44:13.562
- You're supposed to know...
- I had a week to prepare this case.

01:44:13.652 --> 01:44:14.731
I didn't realize
what a fuck up I'm defending.

01:44:14.821 --> 01:44:17.148
- Well, now you know.
- Goddamn.

01:44:30.233 --> 01:44:32.939
- This is going to take us both down.
- How's that work?

01:44:32.979 --> 01:44:36.395
You gonna spend the rest
of your life in prison too?

01:44:46.853 --> 01:44:49.270
I'm sorry.

01:44:53.355 --> 01:44:56.851
- I really screwed up in there, huh?
- Yeah, you really did.

01:44:56.891 --> 01:44:59.348
Whew!

01:44:59.428 --> 01:45:02.554
- So what happens now?
- Shit, I don't know.

01:45:02.594 --> 01:45:06.719
I don't know.

01:45:08.767 --> 01:45:10.555
Your Honor, the government
calls Colonel Bin Le Cao...

01:45:10.595 --> 01:45:12.722
as a rebuttal witness.
- Objection, Your Honor.

01:45:12.762 --> 01:45:14.890
What are the grounds for
this rebuttal witness to be allowed?

01:45:14.970 --> 01:45:17.517
Will counsel please
approach the bench.

01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:26.716
- Who is Colonel Bin Le Cao?
- A North Vietnamese Colonel...

01:45:26.806 --> 01:45:28.883
who fought against Colonel Childers
at the battle of Ca Lu.

01:45:28.923 --> 01:45:32.089
What he has to say directly refutes
statements made by Colonel Childers.

01:45:32.179 --> 01:45:34.636
- When was the battle of Ca Lu?
- 1968.

01:45:34.716 --> 01:45:38.382
This is uncharged misconduct. It is
not allowable under military law.

01:45:38.472 --> 01:45:40.839
How do you know this witness
is going to charge misconduct?

01:45:40.879 --> 01:45:41.888
I'm assuming...

01:45:41.928 --> 01:45:43.845
He knows because he was
at the battle of Ca Lu.

01:45:43.925 --> 01:45:45.843
- Is that true?
- Yes, sir.

01:45:45.923 --> 01:45:48.760
On what grounds are you
calling your witness?

01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:51.118
Colonel Hodges made Colonel
Childers' combat experience...

01:45:51.127 --> 01:45:52.545
part of his defense.

01:45:52.585 --> 01:45:54.543
Furthermore,
Colonel Childers testified...

01:45:54.593 --> 01:45:56.550
that he never shoots unarmed people.

01:45:56.590 --> 01:46:00.626
My witness has an important
perspective on that statement.

01:46:03.422 --> 01:46:06.049
I'm gonna allow the witness.

01:46:19.463 --> 01:46:20.792
Do you swear or affirm...

01:46:20.872 --> 01:46:22.330
that the evidence you shal I give
in this case...

01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:23.938
shall be the truth,
the whole truth...

01:46:24.038 --> 01:46:25.916
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

01:46:25.996 --> 01:46:28.582
Yes, I do.

01:46:28.662 --> 01:46:30.171
Will you please state
your name for the court?

01:46:30.211 --> 01:46:34.915
- My name is Bin Le Cao.
- In 1968, you were a colonel...

01:46:34.995 --> 01:46:37.961
with the North Vietnamese army,
B3 regiment, involved in a fight...

01:46:38.041 --> 01:46:41.747
with American marines at Ca Lu
in the Quang Tri province?

01:46:41.827 --> 01:46:43.245
Yes, I was.

01:46:43.375 --> 01:46:45.413
Will you tell the court
about that battle?

01:46:45.492 --> 01:46:48.619
We were aware that
small units of Americans...

01:46:48.659 --> 01:46:51.785
ryere ryeryr my company of men.

01:46:51.875 --> 01:46:55.201
We found ourselves
behind your forces.

01:46:55.291 --> 01:46:58.907
This was lucky for us
because we were out numbered.

01:47:03.331 --> 01:47:05.239
Do you recognize this man?

01:47:06.827 --> 01:47:08.745
Yes.

01:47:08.825 --> 01:47:11.242
Did he capture you and your
radio operator that day? Yes.

01:47:12.451 --> 01:47:16.246
Did he remove your weapons
and place you under armed guard?

01:47:16.326 --> 01:47:17.245
Yes.

01:47:17.285 --> 01:47:19.203
Did you consider yourself
a prisoner of war?

01:47:19.242 --> 01:47:21.909
Yes.

01:47:21.989 --> 01:47:24.117
Did he execute
your radio operator?

01:47:26.324 --> 01:47:28.242
Yes.

01:47:28.322 --> 01:47:31.158
You personally saw him shoot
a fellow prisoner of war?

01:47:31.238 --> 01:47:33.526
Yes.

01:47:33.615 --> 01:47:36.033
Where did he shoot him?

01:47:36.073 --> 01:47:38.150
In the head.

01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:40.487
Thank you.
No further questions.

01:47:44.902 --> 01:47:48.987
Were your men annihilating
that platoon of marines?

01:47:49.067 --> 01:47:50.985
Yes.

01:47:51.065 --> 01:47:54.021
Did Colonel Childers force you
to call your men off?

01:47:54.151 --> 01:47:56.149
Yes.

01:47:56.239 --> 01:47:58.196
Do you believe his actions
were calculated to save...

01:47:58.236 --> 01:48:02.192
the lives of American marines?
- Yes.

01:48:02.311 --> 01:48:04.729
Would you have done the same
thing Colonel Childers did...

01:48:04.819 --> 01:48:06.736
if the situation
had been reversed?

01:48:14.227 --> 01:48:16.145
Colonel Cao, would you have shot...

01:48:16.235 --> 01:48:18.712
a captive American radio operator
in the head if you thought...

01:48:18.732 --> 01:48:23.436
it would persuade Colonel Childers
to spare the lives of your own men?

01:48:27.142 --> 01:48:29.599
Yes.

01:48:32.436 --> 01:48:35.352
No more questions.

01:48:35.432 --> 01:48:37.889
This court is in recess
until tomorrow at 09:00.

01:48:37.979 --> 01:48:39.897
â™ª NAZWA?

01:48:49.596 --> 01:48:52.222
- General, good to see you.
- Perry, good to see you too.

01:48:52.262 --> 01:48:54.969
I want you to meet my grandson.

01:48:55.059 --> 01:48:57.346
Hi. Nice to meet
you, sir.

01:48:57.426 --> 01:48:59.434
Thanks.

01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:05.886
Colonel Terry Childers
is a decorated war hero,

01:49:05.966 --> 01:49:08.723
a trusted leader
of American marines,

01:49:08.763 --> 01:49:12.139
and I wish that was
all there was to it.

01:49:12.219 --> 01:49:15.555
Unfortunately, there are
83 dead Yemeni citizens,

01:49:15.595 --> 01:49:18.761
many of them
women and children.

01:49:18.841 --> 01:49:22.806
Colonel Hodges would have you
believe that this crowd was armed.

01:49:22.926 --> 01:49:25.243
He would also have you believe
that there is a videotape...

01:49:25.303 --> 01:49:27.630
proving this to be true.

01:49:30.677 --> 01:49:34.552
There is no tape
exonerating Colonel Childers.

01:49:34.632 --> 01:49:38.298
There is no evidence
exonerating Colonel Childers!

01:49:45.589 --> 01:49:50.214
Is Colonel Childers a man capable of
killing defenseless, unarmed people?

01:49:51.882 --> 01:49:54.549
Is he capable of ordering
the execution...

01:49:54.589 --> 01:49:57.965
of innocent men and women?

01:49:58.044 --> 01:50:03.128
Is he capable of executing
P.O.W.s with his own hand?

01:50:03.168 --> 01:50:06.045
Unfortunately,
we have shown that he is.

01:50:06.085 --> 01:50:08.582
You have heard the sad testimony
of Colonel Cao...

01:50:08.672 --> 01:50:11.918
who witnessed Colonel Childers'
barbarism firsthand.

01:50:13.996 --> 01:50:16.912
You've even heard
Colonel Childers' own admission...

01:50:17.002 --> 01:50:21.377
that his desire was to "waste"
them, regardless of who they were.

01:50:25.003 --> 01:50:29.118
Now, we are faced
with the difficult prospect...

01:50:29.168 --> 01:50:31.495
of convicting one of our own.

01:50:31.585 --> 01:50:34.541
None of us wants to do this,
but you've heard the facts,

01:50:34.621 --> 01:50:36.868
and it is unavoidable.

01:50:36.958 --> 01:50:40.874
Colonel Terry Childers ordered
the senseless slaughter...

01:50:40.954 --> 01:50:43.790
of a peaceful crowd!

01:50:43.870 --> 01:50:47.994
Now, as marines,

01:50:47.995 --> 01:50:51.991
we do not get the luxury
of covering up our mistakes.

01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:54.867
We must air them,

01:50:54.947 --> 01:50:58.533
there by ensuring
that they never happen again.

01:50:58.613 --> 01:51:01.369
Thank you.

01:51:08.491 --> 01:51:10.449
That's sovereign
United States territory...

01:51:10.489 --> 01:51:13.445
as much as if it were
in Ohio or Maryland.

01:51:13.485 --> 01:51:15.992
Colonel Childers didn't
volunteer to go over there.

01:51:16.112 --> 01:51:19.108
He was ordered to go there because
he was the best man for the job.

01:51:19.198 --> 01:51:21.156
We armed him.
We trained him.

01:51:21.236 --> 01:51:23.863
We sent him over there to risk
his life to save other Americans.

01:51:23.943 --> 01:51:27.359
And then ask him
not to return fire?

01:51:27.399 --> 01:51:31.114
There are over 300 bullet holes
in this building.

01:51:31.194 --> 01:51:35.859
Colonel Childers didn't open fire.
He returned fire.

01:51:35.949 --> 01:51:39.864
And he waited until after three
of his marines were dead...

01:51:39.944 --> 01:51:42.231
and another lay
mortally wounded.

01:51:42.271 --> 01:51:44.778
He waited until he was
personally under heavy fire.

01:51:44.858 --> 01:51:48.903
He waited until he saw
that crowd holding weapons.

01:51:48.983 --> 01:51:52.519
Only then did he order
his men to return fire.

01:51:52.609 --> 01:51:54.487
Under the rules of engagement,
a civilian pointing a weapon...

01:51:54.527 --> 01:51:56.444
is no longer a civilian,

01:51:56.524 --> 01:51:59.151
and the use of deadly force
is authorized...

01:51:59.191 --> 01:52:02.687
in order to save lives.

01:52:02.777 --> 01:52:05.234
It's not murder.

01:52:06.393 --> 01:52:08.350
It's combat.

01:52:09.649 --> 01:52:11.816
Colonel Childers is
the only man alive...

01:52:11.856 --> 01:52:14.233
who was in a position
to see that crowd.

01:52:14.273 --> 01:52:16.850
But the camera on the embassy
roof had the same point of view.

01:52:16.940 --> 01:52:18.728
The government
would have you believe...

01:52:18.808 --> 01:52:20.855
there's no tape
from that camera.

01:52:20.935 --> 01:52:24.391
I have shown you that that tape was
delivered to the State Department.

01:52:24.481 --> 01:52:26.888
Do you believe that tape
got up and walked out...

01:52:27.018 --> 01:52:29.395
of the State Department
on its own?

01:52:31.433 --> 01:52:33.720
By not producing that tape,
the national security advisor,

01:52:33.810 --> 01:52:37.765
Mr. Sokal, has brought dishonor
into this court.

01:52:37.895 --> 01:52:41.511
Without that tape, I cannot show
you that the crowd fired first...

01:52:41.561 --> 01:52:43.768
and that Colonel Childers
is innocent.

01:52:43.808 --> 01:52:46.725
But without that tape,
they cannot prove...

01:52:46.765 --> 01:52:49.891
beyond a reasonable doubt
that he's guilty!

01:52:52.218 --> 01:52:54.595
Here's my case.

01:52:54.635 --> 01:52:57.262
He's all I've got.
Thirty-two years of service,

01:52:57.342 --> 01:52:59.679
thirty-two years of heroism
as a United States Marine.

01:52:59.759 --> 01:53:02.636
Regardless of
what you decide here,

01:53:02.676 --> 01:53:04.973
Colonel Childers' career
as a marine is over.

01:53:05.053 --> 01:53:07.011
He will never again
command men in combat.

01:53:07.091 --> 01:53:10.387
The ambassador and his family
are alive today because of him.

01:53:10.427 --> 01:53:12.514
And I know how
the ambassador feels,

01:53:12.594 --> 01:53:14.881
because Colonel Childers
saved my life too.

01:53:14.921 --> 01:53:16.879
I'm alive today because of him.

01:53:16.929 --> 01:53:19.925
My son is sitting in
this courtroom because of him.

01:53:19.965 --> 01:53:22.462
I'm alive today,
and I have a son,

01:53:22.552 --> 01:53:25.469
because of the heroism
of Colonel Childers.

01:53:25.549 --> 01:53:29.544
To ask this man to risk his life
for his country,

01:53:31.961 --> 01:53:36.006
to ask this man to watch
his marines die in his arms...

01:53:36.126 --> 01:53:38.633
and call it murder
when he's defending himself,

01:53:38.713 --> 01:53:41.959
call it murder for firing back
when fired upon...

01:53:42.049 --> 01:53:44.626
To call it murder for saving
the lives of his countrymen...

01:53:44.666 --> 01:53:48.631
under the most extreme
of circumstances, that's, uh...

01:53:48.711 --> 01:53:53.296
My fellow Marines,
that's hanging him out to dry.

01:53:54.834 --> 01:53:58.290
It's worse than leaving him
woundedon a battlefield.

01:53:58.380 --> 01:54:01.126
That is something
you do not do...

01:54:01.127 --> 01:54:04.253
if you are
a United States Marine.

01:54:06.251 --> 01:54:09.876
And it is something that I pray
to God you won't do here either.

01:54:34.208 --> 01:54:36.665
- What'd you think?
- You're pretty good.

01:54:36.744 --> 01:54:39.122
Yeah. Yeah.

01:54:39.162 --> 01:54:41.119
Dad, you were awesome.

01:54:41.199 --> 01:54:43.117
Thanks, son.

01:54:43.197 --> 01:54:45.954
I'm very glad that I don't
have to sit on that panel, son.

01:54:45.994 --> 01:54:47.951
You made it
awful tough on them.

01:54:51.327 --> 01:54:53.904
- 15,000 to 25,000...
- Excuse me.

01:54:58.489 --> 01:55:00.406
I said no interruptions.

01:55:00.486 --> 01:55:03.443
I'm sorry, Mr. Sokal.
It's very important.

01:55:08.906 --> 01:55:10.864
Send him in.

01:55:12.073 --> 01:55:14.740
Can we pick this up
after lunch, gentlemen?

01:55:14.819 --> 01:55:16.737
Absolutely.

01:55:34.236 --> 01:55:36.773
Close the door.

01:55:40.609 --> 01:55:43.146
What is it, Colonel?

01:55:43.236 --> 01:55:47.481
No matter what happens
to Terry Childers tomorrow,

01:55:47.561 --> 01:55:48.859
I'm not going to leave
thisjob until I find out...

01:55:48.899 --> 01:55:53.184
what happened to that tape.
- Good.

01:55:53.274 --> 01:55:55.391
Think it'll ever turn up?

01:55:55.481 --> 01:55:57.649
No.

01:55:57.689 --> 01:56:00.316
I don't either.

01:56:00.395 --> 01:56:04.441
Well, then there's nothing more
for us to talk about, is there?

01:56:04.521 --> 01:56:07.937
You ever had a pissed-off
marine on your ass?

01:56:08.016 --> 01:56:10.773
Is that a threat?

01:56:10.813 --> 01:56:13.230
Oh, yes, sir.

01:56:52.384 --> 01:56:55.430
All rise.

01:57:00.634 --> 01:57:02.592
Has the panel
reached a verdict?

01:57:02.722 --> 01:57:04.969
We have, sir.

01:57:17.634 --> 01:57:21.090
