(phone chiming)

01:00.358 --> 01:02.960
(line ringing)

01:03.027 --> 01:04.727
ISLER: Dwayne.
- Raymond.

01:04.796 --> 01:07.064
- It's for real?
ISLER: Source panned out.

01:07.131 --> 01:09.299
Got hard intel Avery Walker's
holed up in South Ossetia

01:09.367 --> 01:11.401
near the border with
the Georgian Republic.

01:11.469 --> 01:14.304
South Caucasus is not
friendly territory.

01:14.372 --> 01:15.639
They got a war on.

01:15.707 --> 01:17.140
We get in fast,
we grab Walker,

01:17.208 --> 01:19.309
and any other Apollyon assets,

01:19.377 --> 01:20.978
we're back in Tbilisi
before daylight.

01:21.045 --> 01:22.412
This feels right to you?

01:22.480 --> 01:24.224
Got him on the hook.
Just got to reel him in.

01:24.248 --> 01:26.683
All right, I'll monitor
the mission from SCIF.

01:26.751 --> 01:28.585
Hey... be honest.

01:28.653 --> 01:30.587
Kind of wish you were here
for this, right?

01:30.655 --> 01:32.289
Just want y'all back safe.

01:32.357 --> 01:33.690
See you on screen

01:33.758 --> 01:35.158
in a couple hours.

01:55.747 --> 01:58.015
We got you, Walker.

02:05.089 --> 02:06.356
Hold.

02:08.258 --> 02:09.493
Ready to breach.

02:09.560 --> 02:12.062
Last drone pass
was ten minutes ago.

02:12.130 --> 02:13.507
Thermal imagery showed
three inside.

02:13.531 --> 02:15.065
Looks like a courtyard.

02:15.133 --> 02:18.168
Walker's one of them.
Let's get this son of a bitch.

02:20.772 --> 02:22.072
PRIDE:
Be careful.

02:48.266 --> 02:50.567
Hands where we can see them!
On the ground, now!

02:50.635 --> 02:53.904
What the hell?
What's going on, Raymond?

02:57.175 --> 02:58.675
Abort! Abort!

02:58.743 --> 03:00.544
- Kirby, it's a trap!
- Get out of there now!

03:04.582 --> 03:06.016
They're up top!

03:06.084 --> 03:07.451
(indistinct shouting)

03:43.814 --> 03:45.681
What happened?

03:45.749 --> 03:47.850
Intel led the task force
to a compound

03:47.918 --> 03:50.920
over the Georgian border
in South Ossetia.

03:50.988 --> 03:52.455
Walker was supposed
to be there.

03:52.523 --> 03:54.057
It was an ambush.

03:54.124 --> 03:56.426
- How many survived?
- I'm not sure.

03:56.493 --> 03:58.895
Maybe no one.

03:58.962 --> 04:01.531
The operation was compromised.

04:01.598 --> 04:03.266
- Who else was read in?
- Me,

04:03.333 --> 04:06.235
Isler, the task force.

04:06.303 --> 04:07.870
What about Ryan's source?

04:07.938 --> 04:09.105
Luka Osman.

04:09.173 --> 04:10.183
Former Turkish
intelligence.

04:10.207 --> 04:13.910
He fed us the location
of the compound.

04:13.977 --> 04:15.822
I'll have Ryan circle back.
See if Osman double-dipped.

04:15.846 --> 04:16.946
There's something else.

04:17.014 --> 04:18.915
Satellite feed
I was watching.

04:18.982 --> 04:21.951
Moments after the ambush,
I lost contact.

04:22.019 --> 04:23.719
Someone switched it off.

04:23.787 --> 04:25.098
Luka Osman couldn't
have done that.

04:25.122 --> 04:27.757
No. Someone closer to home.

04:27.825 --> 04:29.425
Someone with access
to our secure comms--

04:29.493 --> 04:30.626
We have a double agent.

04:31.607 --> 04:33.361
Walker's still
out there.

04:33.362 --> 04:36.664
But whoever betrayed the
task force is our path to him.

04:36.732 --> 04:39.533
You want to read the rest of
the team in or should I?

04:39.601 --> 04:41.302
No. This stays between us.

04:41.370 --> 04:42.370
Dwayne...

04:42.404 --> 04:44.505
Walker knows that
we're onto him.

04:44.573 --> 04:47.308
I need to be strategic about
who I let into the circle,

04:47.376 --> 04:49.343
and when.
- You need <i>help.</i>

04:49.411 --> 04:50.645
Isler tried to help.

04:50.712 --> 04:53.180
I stayed behind,
and he paid the price.

04:53.248 --> 04:55.182
And I'm gonna deal
with this.

04:55.250 --> 04:56.890
I don't want to put
anyone else in danger.

04:56.952 --> 04:58.285
You can't go after
Walker alone.

04:58.353 --> 05:00.321
Hannah, I'm asking you
to back my play.

05:02.257 --> 05:03.724
All right.

05:03.792 --> 05:05.536
I'll make some inquiries
to the intel community.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.561
See if we can't find
any survivors.

05:07.629 --> 05:10.197
I won't give any details
about the raid.

05:10.265 --> 05:13.367
But if there's a chance
that someone is still alive...

05:13.435 --> 05:15.336
(quietly):
Yeah.

05:18.707 --> 05:20.574
- Everything okay?
- Yep.

05:20.642 --> 05:21.876
Okay.

05:21.943 --> 05:24.245
'Cause you've been sitting
out here for a while.

05:24.312 --> 05:27.248
Like... two hours and
12 minutes by my count.

05:27.315 --> 05:28.749
You stalking me, Sebastian?

05:28.817 --> 05:31.057
Not as much as you're stalking
Hannah, who's been in SCIF

05:31.119 --> 05:32.486
for two hours
and 33 minutes.

05:34.322 --> 05:35.633
It's, like, a weird gift
that I have.

05:35.657 --> 05:36.901
I don't have to look at a clock.

05:36.925 --> 05:37.925
Like having a superpower.

05:37.959 --> 05:40.728
No practical application.

05:40.796 --> 05:43.364
Yeah. Well, my weird gift
is knowing

05:43.432 --> 05:44.832
when something's not right.

05:44.900 --> 05:47.501
Hannah's been in and out
of that SCIF room all day.

05:47.569 --> 05:48.869
Could be administrative
meetings.

05:48.937 --> 05:52.940
Could be. She's been taking
several calls from Pride, too.

05:53.008 --> 05:55.168
You're just gonna sit here
and wait till she comes out?

05:58.146 --> 05:59.280
(clears throat)

05:59.347 --> 06:01.615
(sighs)

06:04.586 --> 06:06.754
Should I get some snacks
or something? This...

06:09.691 --> 06:11.559
Hey, guys.
What's going on?

06:11.626 --> 06:12.960
Can I help you
with something?

06:13.028 --> 06:14.862
Uh, you could start
by helping us understand

06:14.930 --> 06:16.297
why you've been in there
all day.

06:16.364 --> 06:18.532
Administrative stuff.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.034
No, that's not true.

06:20.102 --> 06:21.368
He's got a superpower.

06:21.436 --> 06:22.847
And since the moment
you came in this morning,

06:22.871 --> 06:25.072
it's clear that something
big is happening.

06:25.140 --> 06:26.140
Don't be holding out.

06:26.208 --> 06:27.775
Chris, I am not holding out.

06:27.843 --> 06:29.110
But Pride is?

06:29.177 --> 06:30.544
All right.

06:30.612 --> 06:33.714
I'll just go to Belle Chasse
and talk to him myself.

06:33.782 --> 06:35.216
He's not at Belle Chasse.

06:35.283 --> 06:36.417
PRIDE:
<i>You used to be</i>

06:36.485 --> 06:38.319
a secret agent.

06:38.386 --> 06:40.454
Thought you'd be better
at the secret part.

06:40.522 --> 06:42.123
We didn't give
her a choice.

06:42.190 --> 06:44.168
Yeah, whatever you're going
through, we're here for you.

06:44.192 --> 06:46.727
- All right? We're family.
- I haven't told them a thing.

06:46.795 --> 06:49.096
And I have new intel
about the raid.

06:49.164 --> 06:52.233
What raid?
What's going on?

06:52.300 --> 06:54.068
Apollyon.

06:54.136 --> 06:57.471
- Avery Walker?
- He's still alive.

06:57.539 --> 06:59.306
Like I thought.

06:59.374 --> 07:01.475
He's somewhere in
Eastern Europe.

07:01.543 --> 07:04.578
Raymond Isler and a small
off-the-books task force

07:04.646 --> 07:07.414
tried to take him down,
but... they failed.

07:07.482 --> 07:09.416
Walker knew they were coming.

07:09.484 --> 07:10.618
Someone spilled the beans.

07:10.685 --> 07:12.319
Got any leads on who?

07:12.387 --> 07:13.854
HANNAH:
Ryan had a source.

07:13.922 --> 07:17.124
Luka Osman. Gave us intel
leading up to the raid.

07:17.192 --> 07:18.836
He's gone to ground.
He's either dead or...

07:18.860 --> 07:20.327
Or sold out the task force.

07:20.395 --> 07:21.495
Any survivors?

07:21.563 --> 07:23.197
Doesn't look like it.

07:23.265 --> 07:24.331
Actually,
that's not true.

07:24.399 --> 07:26.634
A colleague over at NSA

07:26.701 --> 07:29.637
picked up some chatter about a
ransom going out from South Ossetia.

07:29.704 --> 07:31.038
Ransom for who?

07:31.106 --> 07:32.216
Hostage captured
by local militia

07:32.240 --> 07:33.718
who say he's important.
A U.S. citizen.

07:33.742 --> 07:34.742
African American.

07:34.776 --> 07:36.443
Isler.

07:37.779 --> 07:39.013
He's alive, Dwayne.

07:40.415 --> 07:42.783
I need to get him.
Before Apollyon.

07:42.851 --> 07:44.185
No, King.

07:44.252 --> 07:45.953
<i>We</i> need to get him.

07:46.021 --> 07:48.122
HANNAH:
But first,

07:48.190 --> 07:50.691
you need to read in
the rest of the team.

07:50.759 --> 07:53.694
(sighs)

07:53.762 --> 07:55.696
GREGORIO:
What's the play, boss?

07:55.764 --> 07:57.998
Isler's task force
was compromised.

07:58.066 --> 08:02.837
Maybe it was Luka Osman.
Maybe it was closer to home.

08:02.904 --> 08:04.839
Dig into every task force
member.

08:04.906 --> 08:06.674
Somebody talked
to someone.

08:06.741 --> 08:08.242
Not just talked.

08:08.310 --> 08:10.021
They were able to hack
into the secure SCIF feed.

08:10.045 --> 08:12.213
Monitor communications
during the raid.

08:12.280 --> 08:14.048
I'll find out who and how.

08:14.115 --> 08:15.693
GREGORIO: Which leaves the
issue of Isler

08:15.717 --> 08:17.484
being held captive halfway
across the world

08:17.552 --> 08:19.053
in South whatever-it's-called.

08:19.120 --> 08:22.056
Well, it won't be for long.
I'm heading there today.

08:22.123 --> 08:24.191
- No.
- LASALLE: King...

08:24.259 --> 08:26.204
Area's gonna be crawling
with Apollyon operatives.

08:26.228 --> 08:27.605
HANNAH: Not to mention
warring militias.

08:27.629 --> 08:28.996
State Department

08:29.064 --> 08:30.107
has specialists that handle

08:30.131 --> 08:31.699
these kinds of ransom
situations.

08:31.766 --> 08:32.977
PRIDE: Isler had no official
authorization

08:33.001 --> 08:35.236
to even be in South Ossetia.

08:35.303 --> 08:38.572
His entire task force
has scrubbed identities.

08:38.640 --> 08:40.341
No one even knows
he's in the region.

08:40.408 --> 08:41.842
How are <i>you</i> gonna get there?

08:41.909 --> 08:45.212
Task force snuck in with
non-official cover

08:45.280 --> 08:47.882
as members of an NGO
providing humanitarian aid.

08:47.949 --> 08:49.183
I'll do the same.

08:49.251 --> 08:51.051
They want $2 million ransom.

08:51.119 --> 08:52.553
Where are you gonna get that?

08:52.621 --> 08:53.921
Still working on that.

08:53.989 --> 08:55.723
Sebastian and I
got you covered.

08:55.790 --> 08:58.425
Counterfeit currency we seized
from the Prescott Shipping bust.

08:58.493 --> 08:59.770
Oh, yeah. We still have
that in evidence.

08:59.794 --> 09:01.228
- We can requisition that.
- Yeah.

09:01.296 --> 09:02.863
We just need
approval from the SAC.

09:02.931 --> 09:04.965
Consider it approved.
Get me that cash.

09:05.033 --> 09:06.634
All right.
I got a flight to catch.

09:06.701 --> 09:08.135
You need backup.

09:08.203 --> 09:10.738
Someone who's been to
that part of the world before.

09:10.805 --> 09:13.274
Tbilisi.

09:13.341 --> 09:16.310
My first overseas
assignment with NCIS.

09:16.378 --> 09:17.945
Spent three months training

09:18.013 --> 09:19.313
in the Georgian
federal police.

09:19.381 --> 09:21.916
I know the terrain.
I know the people.

09:21.983 --> 09:23.794
HANNAH: And you don't know
what's waiting for you when you get there.

09:23.818 --> 09:25.719
It's a good idea.
Take Lasalle.

09:27.022 --> 09:29.223
Grab your go bag.

09:43.571 --> 09:45.272
Jet lag hitting you?

09:45.340 --> 09:47.308
Two flights ago, back in Ankara.

09:47.375 --> 09:50.844
Hmm. Thank you, Pete.

09:50.912 --> 09:55.749
Probably only gonna be
a day or two at the most.

09:55.817 --> 09:58.519
I'm going back across
the border to Georgia.

09:58.586 --> 10:00.154
Can't stick around here.

10:00.221 --> 10:02.022
I like breathing too much.
- (chuckles)

10:02.090 --> 10:04.425
The vehicle you asked for
is over there.

10:04.492 --> 10:05.826
I'm gonna refuel.

10:05.894 --> 10:08.034
Call me when you need
transport back.

10:08.058 --> 10:08.662
You got it.

10:08.663 --> 10:10.764
Thank you.

10:10.832 --> 10:13.300
(takes deep breath)
I like this place.

10:13.368 --> 10:14.935
Reminds me of the
woods back home.

10:15.003 --> 10:17.104
Yeah. Let's just get
the gear in the car.

10:17.172 --> 10:19.440
This is gonna be
a piece of cake.

10:19.507 --> 10:20.808
(sirens wailing)

10:20.875 --> 10:23.110
You just had to say it,
didn't you?

10:23.178 --> 10:25.446
Here's hoping our Canadian
passports work.

10:27.549 --> 10:28.716
PRIDE:
Hello.

10:30.285 --> 10:32.786
Hi. We're, uh...

10:32.854 --> 10:34.188
We are just moving, uh,

10:34.255 --> 10:35.556
medical supplies.

10:36.958 --> 10:38.025
Papers.

10:38.093 --> 10:39.827
Oh, yeah. Sure.

10:42.697 --> 10:43.831
Here you go.

10:46.468 --> 10:48.635
(speaking Russian)

10:51.406 --> 10:52.539
Open.

10:52.607 --> 10:54.641
Yeah.

10:54.709 --> 10:56.510
(speaking Russian)

10:59.114 --> 11:02.349
Medicine. All right?
Uh, doctors.

11:03.885 --> 11:06.153
(shouting in Russian)

11:06.221 --> 11:08.255
Little help, Christopher.

11:08.323 --> 11:11.358
(speaking Russian)

11:11.426 --> 11:12.826
Uh...

11:12.894 --> 11:15.162
- What'd you say?
- I meant to say

11:15.230 --> 11:17.498
we mean no harm, but...

11:17.565 --> 11:19.400
it's possible I insulted
their mamas.

11:27.527 --> 11:29.990
(shouting in Russian)

11:30.536 --> 11:32.771
Okay, excuse-excuse me.

11:33.379 --> 11:37.683
We can pay you money,
give you money...

11:37.750 --> 11:40.686
if you just let--
just let us go.

11:40.753 --> 11:43.589
May I? Okay, right...

11:45.191 --> 11:46.959
See.

11:47.026 --> 11:48.460
I can just...

11:52.065 --> 11:53.065
(speaks Russian)

11:55.368 --> 11:56.501
What...?

11:59.405 --> 12:01.506
This is the worst
rescue attempt ever.

12:01.574 --> 12:04.443
(rock music playing loudly
over SUV speakers)

12:04.510 --> 12:06.645
♪﻿﻿﻿ ♪

12:06.713 --> 12:07.846
(music stops)

12:07.914 --> 12:09.648
(man speaking Russian)

12:15.755 --> 12:17.689
(continues in Russian)

12:24.631 --> 12:26.898
(speaking Russian)

12:33.306 --> 12:34.873
(sighs)
Here we go.

12:34.941 --> 12:36.074
Who are you?

12:36.142 --> 12:40.178
I'm Luka Osman.

12:40.246 --> 12:41.647
Your asset.

12:41.714 --> 12:46.551
You know, I already
paid them off. $5,000.

12:46.619 --> 12:49.688
You were robbed.
The going rate is 500.

12:49.756 --> 12:51.657
I'm guessing we can't
get a rebate.

12:51.724 --> 12:53.558
Afraid not.

12:53.626 --> 12:55.426
I'm very sorry for all the,
uh, inconvenience.

12:55.461 --> 12:58.363
I would have been here sooner,
but I had to avoid firefight

12:58.431 --> 12:59.865
on the way in, you know?

12:59.932 --> 13:02.034
We've been trying to
get in touch with you.

13:02.101 --> 13:04.770
And now I'm here.
Okay, forget this rusted heap.

13:04.837 --> 13:06.838
Put your bags into my car.

13:06.906 --> 13:08.507
We have meeting
with militia soon, yes?

13:08.574 --> 13:09.941
Get your friend back.

13:10.009 --> 13:11.449
How'd this joker know
we were coming?

13:11.511 --> 13:13.045
Good point. Mr. Osman?

13:15.481 --> 13:19.051
Please, for my friends, Luka.

13:19.118 --> 13:20.452
Ryan Porter reached
out to you

13:20.520 --> 13:23.055
when our colleagues'
mission failed.

13:23.122 --> 13:24.289
You never answered.

13:24.357 --> 13:26.058
It hasn't been that safe to use

13:26.125 --> 13:28.293
traditional communications
recently.

13:28.361 --> 13:30.095
But I've kept my eye
on situation.

13:30.163 --> 13:32.397
Now, do you want
to take scenic route

13:32.465 --> 13:34.599
or play dodge RPG?

13:34.667 --> 13:37.235
Let's go, come on.

13:37.303 --> 13:39.271
Sure we can
trust this guy?

13:39.338 --> 13:42.074
Not sure we have a choice.

13:44.310 --> 13:47.212
Okay, I'll check in with you
in the morning.

13:47.280 --> 13:50.315
Yeah. Give her a kiss
from me. Okay.

13:50.383 --> 13:52.284
What's up?

13:52.351 --> 13:55.721
I sent Ryan and Naomi to stay
with relatives in Kansas

13:55.788 --> 13:56.922
until this ends.

13:56.989 --> 14:00.158
Yeah, if it ever ends.

14:00.226 --> 14:02.260
Well, I-I'm just saying,
Avery Walker, you know,

14:02.328 --> 14:03.995
he-he picked up
the Apollyon torch.

14:04.063 --> 14:05.564
He escaped federal prison,

14:05.631 --> 14:07.632
he's eluded capture for,
like, months.

14:07.700 --> 14:09.434
He's just a man, Sebastian,
a bad one,

14:09.502 --> 14:11.069
but one that we're gonna stop.

14:11.137 --> 14:13.048
But every attempt that
we've made to-to catch him,

14:13.072 --> 14:15.140
or even find him, i-is failing.

14:15.208 --> 14:16.719
It's like he erased
himself permanently.

14:16.743 --> 14:18.143
Nothing's ever
permanently erased.

14:18.211 --> 14:19.411
Just got to keep digging.

14:19.479 --> 14:21.313
Sounds like you
found something, P.

14:21.380 --> 14:23.682
Whoever got into that
Belle Chasse SCIF system

14:23.750 --> 14:25.984
to hack into that sat feed
of that raid is good.

14:26.052 --> 14:28.620
During the raid, the system
intruder kept bouncing

14:28.688 --> 14:30.265
the signal across terminals
all over the world.

14:30.289 --> 14:31.323
But I got
a taste of him.

14:31.390 --> 14:32.801
GREGORIO: What are
we looking at here?

14:32.825 --> 14:35.827
Weeks of data mining to find the
origin of the hacker's signal,

14:35.895 --> 14:37.162
but I found
a shortcut.

14:37.230 --> 14:39.331
You know how he accessed
the secure line?

14:39.398 --> 14:40.766
He went old school, baby.

14:40.833 --> 14:42.244
He tapped into the
Belle Chasse hardline.

14:42.268 --> 14:44.269
Probably attached
a sniffer to search

14:44.337 --> 14:45.470
for the encrypted feed.

14:45.538 --> 14:48.273
Means he had access to the base.
Military clearance.

14:48.341 --> 14:50.609
We need to cross-reference
everyone who's accessed

14:50.676 --> 14:52.554
Belle Chasse with people
connected to the task force.

14:52.578 --> 14:54.346
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

14:58.342 --> 15:00.018
PRIDE:
<i>What is this place?</i>

15:02.613 --> 15:04.981
My office.

15:07.199 --> 15:10.034
Ah, that's a
word for it.

15:13.939 --> 15:15.573
PRIDE: Lot of these
are U.S. military.

15:15.640 --> 15:17.408
Do I want to know
where you got them?

15:17.476 --> 15:19.243
OSMAN: A man needs
to make a living.

15:19.311 --> 15:21.045
I make mine
by providing

15:21.112 --> 15:24.215
"hard to come by" merchandise.
- Obtained illegally.

15:24.282 --> 15:25.716
There's no laws here.

15:25.784 --> 15:28.018
Eh, not ones that you are
used to upholding.

15:28.086 --> 15:30.221
Anything to make a buck, huh?

15:30.288 --> 15:32.056
Why don't we stay focused, huh?

15:32.123 --> 15:34.024
Your job is to find
your friend, yes?

15:34.092 --> 15:35.526
PRIDE:
Yes.

15:35.594 --> 15:38.929
And to find out how Isler and
his team walked into a massacre.

15:38.997 --> 15:42.700
And, obviously, you suspect me.

15:42.767 --> 15:45.369
As it should be.

15:45.437 --> 15:47.938
But I was not responsible
for their betrayal.

15:48.006 --> 15:51.275
So we're just supposed
to take your word for it?

15:51.343 --> 15:55.079
I am many things, but above all,
I am loyal to my friends.

15:55.146 --> 15:58.516
- Isler wasn't your friend.
- But Ryan Porter is.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.084
I owe him my life,

16:00.151 --> 16:02.353
and he asked me
to look out for your people.

16:02.420 --> 16:03.587
So what happened?

16:03.655 --> 16:08.025
I met Isler on the Georgian side
of the border.

16:08.093 --> 16:10.761
And I shared with him everything
that I had acquired about

16:10.829 --> 16:12.263
the whereabouts of Avery Walker.

16:12.330 --> 16:14.732
When I found out that
the mission had failed,

16:14.799 --> 16:17.101
I assumed the worst.
I was...

16:17.168 --> 16:21.038
shocked to find out
that Isler had survived.

16:21.106 --> 16:22.640
And the militia
that captured him?

16:22.707 --> 16:25.943
They call themselves Cerberus.
In Ancient Greek mythology,

16:26.011 --> 16:28.379
it's the three-headed hellhound
that guards the entrance

16:28.446 --> 16:30.714
to the underworld.
- Really?

16:30.782 --> 16:33.384
Pretentious, I know, but...

16:33.451 --> 16:36.921
they are dangerous
and they are desperate.

16:36.988 --> 16:39.056
War is not going their way,
and they need cash.

16:39.124 --> 16:41.559
Do you have the money?

17:08.153 --> 17:09.920
Counterfeit.

17:12.089 --> 17:15.291
Boys, it's my business
to know these things,

17:15.359 --> 17:17.694
but it's not theirs.

17:17.762 --> 17:22.199
These bills, they should be
good enough to fool the militia.

17:22.267 --> 17:25.135
If not...

17:25.203 --> 17:27.605
we'll all be shot
in the head, yes?

17:28.840 --> 17:30.140
Who wants tea?

17:30.208 --> 17:32.176
(clears throat)

17:34.579 --> 17:35.813
He's fun.

17:38.683 --> 17:41.218
Pride and Lasalle made contact
with Luka Osman.

17:41.286 --> 17:42.453
They'll make
the trade soon.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.688
That's assuming Isler's
still alive.

17:44.756 --> 17:46.824
Yeah. You two were
pretty close, huh?

17:46.891 --> 17:48.692
I mean, he was my boss
at the FBI.

17:48.760 --> 17:50.237
We didn't go bowling
or anything, but...

17:50.261 --> 17:52.630
if it weren't for him,
I wouldn't be here.

17:52.697 --> 17:54.565
He convinced you to join NCIS?

17:54.633 --> 17:57.801
Kind of. I mean,
he brought me down here.

17:57.869 --> 17:59.470
Could tell I wasn't
satisfied in D.C.

17:59.537 --> 18:02.039
Yeah. (chuckles)

18:02.107 --> 18:03.918
Becoming part of the team
changed everything for me,

18:03.942 --> 18:05.376
and Isler was
a big part of that.

18:05.443 --> 18:07.811
- We'll get him back soon. Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:07.879 --> 18:09.013
SEBASTIAN:
Hannah.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.214
We found the mole.

18:10.281 --> 18:12.149
Had to drill down
because the DoD files

18:12.217 --> 18:14.585
on "Special Operations"
were heavily redacted.

18:14.653 --> 18:15.853
Special Operations?

18:15.920 --> 18:17.840
SEBASTIAN: That's the work
that Isler's teammate,

18:17.889 --> 18:18.915
Will Kirby, was doing for the CIA.

18:18.939 --> 18:20.324
He served under a former

18:20.325 --> 18:22.426
Delta Force commander,
Major Thomas Dixon.

18:22.494 --> 18:24.328
And Dixon's been out
of the service for years,

18:24.396 --> 18:27.064
but he used his veteran's I.D.
to access the Belle Chasse

18:27.132 --> 18:28.097
Naval Exchange a few days ago.

18:28.121 --> 18:29.266
HANNAH: So Kirby broke ranks

18:29.267 --> 18:32.036
and talked to his old commander
about the task force mission.

18:32.103 --> 18:33.398
Dixon made a deal with Apollyon.

18:33.422 --> 18:34.805
PATTON: He could've
hacked the SCIF line

18:34.806 --> 18:36.874
and hop onto Pride's encrypted
satellite feed.

18:36.941 --> 18:38.742
Which means Dixon
had all of those men killed.

18:38.810 --> 18:40.177
Do we have a location?

18:40.245 --> 18:41.922
Yeah, he lives an hour away
in Mississippi.

18:41.946 --> 18:44.882
I'll contact Pride,
tell him we found the mole.

18:44.949 --> 18:46.950
PRIDE:
<i>This Cerberus militia,</i>

18:47.018 --> 18:49.620
they gonna be true
to their word?

18:49.688 --> 18:51.689
As true as anybody
in these parts.

18:51.756 --> 18:54.958
That's not really
an answer.

18:55.026 --> 18:56.627
You can ask them yourselves.

18:59.998 --> 19:03.067
(rock music playing loudly
over SUV speakers)

19:03.134 --> 19:05.069
(music stops)

19:12.644 --> 19:14.978
Let me speak to the leader
first, huh?

19:15.046 --> 19:18.115
And if, uh, something happens
to me, don't try to save me.

19:18.183 --> 19:19.316
Don't worry.

19:19.384 --> 19:22.252
(chuckles)

19:22.320 --> 19:24.421
(speaking Russian)

19:27.292 --> 19:28.459
That's not good.

19:28.526 --> 19:30.594
Let's just hope Luka's
making a deal

19:30.662 --> 19:32.096
to release Isler,

19:32.163 --> 19:34.565
instead of offering
two more hostages.

19:36.634 --> 19:38.502
(speaking Russian)

19:42.807 --> 19:44.842
Stay with the cash.

19:44.909 --> 19:46.477
I got you covered, King.

19:48.580 --> 19:51.448
Not sure that'll
do any good.

19:56.054 --> 19:58.789
How's it going
over here?

19:58.857 --> 20:02.192
I was just trying to negotiate
a fair price.

20:02.260 --> 20:06.330
There's no negotiations.
$2 million for your man.

20:06.397 --> 20:08.165
Your English is good.

20:08.233 --> 20:10.467
FSB trained us
to know our enemy.

20:10.535 --> 20:13.270
Russian State Security.
We're not your enemy.

20:13.338 --> 20:14.972
Just want my man.

20:15.039 --> 20:17.274
Your man is U.S. government,
you are U.S. government,

20:17.342 --> 20:18.776
and the U.S. is our...

20:18.843 --> 20:20.644
Is the enemy, I understand.

20:20.712 --> 20:22.846
But you want
your money,

20:22.914 --> 20:24.448
show me my man.

20:24.516 --> 20:27.017
Money first, then the hostage.

20:43.067 --> 20:45.169
We need to see Isler.

20:51.309 --> 20:54.011
Dwayne, what are
you doing here?

20:54.078 --> 20:58.348
Had a bunch of vacation days
saved up. You okay?

20:58.416 --> 20:59.650
Swell.

20:59.717 --> 21:01.819
Everyone is good?

21:01.886 --> 21:03.253
I check the money,
you check him.

21:08.793 --> 21:10.160
How much was I worth?

21:10.228 --> 21:12.062
$2 million.

21:12.130 --> 21:13.864
The State Department
agreed to pay that?

21:13.932 --> 21:15.599
State Department has no idea.

21:15.667 --> 21:18.068
Then how'd you get that money?

21:18.136 --> 21:19.937
You don't want to know.

21:21.773 --> 21:24.007
(speaks Russian)

21:24.075 --> 21:26.075
ISLER: What aren't you
telling me about that money?

21:36.120 --> 21:37.721
We are good.

22:01.145 --> 22:02.546
(inhales sharply)

22:02.614 --> 22:03.947
Dixon's been shot.

22:04.015 --> 22:05.716
Let's move in.

22:07.819 --> 22:09.486
Federal agents!

22:15.994 --> 22:17.461
Clear.

22:20.732 --> 22:22.299
So who killed Dixon?

22:22.367 --> 22:24.301
(phone rings)

22:24.369 --> 22:25.736
Pride.

22:25.803 --> 22:27.170
Good news, Hannah.

22:27.238 --> 22:28.839
We've got Isler.

22:28.907 --> 22:30.384
HANNAH: That's great, is he okay?
(helicopter approaching)

22:30.408 --> 22:31.808
Pride?

22:33.544 --> 22:35.512
(men shouting)

22:45.490 --> 22:46.790
Pride?
(gunfire)

23:03.210 --> 23:05.978
(helicopter blades whirring)

23:06.046 --> 23:07.747
(panting)

23:07.815 --> 23:10.116
It's coming back around
for another pass.

23:10.184 --> 23:12.451
We can't be out here
in the open.

23:12.519 --> 23:14.453
Where's Luka?

23:14.521 --> 23:16.489
No time to find out. Let's go.

23:31.839 --> 23:33.806
(glass shattering)

23:35.542 --> 23:37.276
(gunfire stops)

23:37.344 --> 23:38.978
They must be reloading.

23:41.181 --> 23:42.448
HANNAH:
I got two.

23:45.018 --> 23:46.452
Two more out front.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.921
Four-man team, not a fair fight.

23:52.059 --> 23:54.293
- Stay down.
- Where you going?

23:54.361 --> 23:57.096
Evening the odds.

23:57.164 --> 23:58.798
Well, what are we
supposed to do?

23:58.866 --> 24:00.226
Play dead until
you hear my signal.

24:22.055 --> 24:23.389
Where is Avery Walker?

24:28.395 --> 24:30.162
This was a setup.

24:30.230 --> 24:32.798
They led us to Dixon
to take us out.

24:32.866 --> 24:35.134
They may well be doing
the same thing to Pride.

24:35.202 --> 24:39.171
(phone ringing)

24:39.239 --> 24:41.974
HANNAH: Pride, we just
walked into an ambush.

24:50.617 --> 24:52.051
(speaking Russian)

24:55.822 --> 24:57.390
(panting)

25:00.327 --> 25:01.894
(grunts, panting)

25:01.962 --> 25:03.729
Raymond, hey.

25:03.797 --> 25:05.398
(panting)
- You okay?

25:05.465 --> 25:07.500
Yeah, just... took a bad step.

25:10.771 --> 25:13.072
I know this
ain't easy, Isler.

25:13.140 --> 25:14.874
But we got to
watch our step.

25:14.942 --> 25:16.375
Broken branches and boot prints

25:16.443 --> 25:18.044
put these guys
right on our tails.

25:18.111 --> 25:20.413
Just try to avoid
loose dirt and mud.

25:20.480 --> 25:22.581
All right. I'm sorry,
I wasn't expecting

25:22.649 --> 25:24.784
to sprint after my capture.

25:24.851 --> 25:26.719
(exhales)
Maybe you guys should just

25:26.787 --> 25:28.354
leave me behind.
- Are you kidding?

25:28.422 --> 25:31.457
(exhales)
It wasn't my first choice.

25:31.525 --> 25:33.503
Raymond, we'll just stop for
a second, take a breath. Okay?

25:33.527 --> 25:34.627
ISLER:
Okay.

25:34.695 --> 25:36.529
(Isler panting)

25:36.596 --> 25:38.431
But let's take it quick.

25:38.498 --> 25:40.032
Gunfire stopped
a few minutes ago.

25:40.100 --> 25:42.635
Someone will be
looking for us.

25:44.304 --> 25:47.039
PRIDE:
Hey. That gunship.

25:47.107 --> 25:48.607
- That was Apollyon.
- Yeah.

25:48.675 --> 25:50.476
It means that Walker
knows you're here

25:50.544 --> 25:52.745
and he's gonna keep coming.
- Militia, too.

25:52.813 --> 25:54.480
They probably think
we set them up.

25:54.548 --> 25:56.115
Where does Luka fit in?

25:56.183 --> 25:57.383
He double-cross us?

25:57.451 --> 25:59.418
No time to find out.

25:59.486 --> 26:00.920
We need to get across
that border

26:00.988 --> 26:03.255
into Georgia.
Only way we survive this.

26:04.958 --> 26:08.160
(man speaking Russian
in distance)

26:10.397 --> 26:11.964
(winces)

26:18.171 --> 26:19.905
- Ow, ow, ah!
- Shut up.

26:19.973 --> 26:21.941
PATTON:
Hey, where's Hannah?

26:22.009 --> 26:23.776
Still trying
to make contact with Pride.

26:23.844 --> 26:26.012
Yeah, it's taking too long.
Doesn't feel right.

26:26.079 --> 26:27.780
Yeah, well, not much
we can do from here

26:27.848 --> 26:29.659
other than work the case.
You got something, P?

26:29.683 --> 26:31.751
Only confirmation
that we got played big time.

26:31.818 --> 26:34.453
Dixon wasn't even
involved with Apollyon.

26:34.521 --> 26:35.083
He was a patsy?

26:35.107 --> 26:37.048
I thought he tapped
into the hardline at Belle Chasse.

26:37.072 --> 26:39.492
No, he didn't.
He didn't even access the base.

26:39.559 --> 26:42.328
Wait, wait, wait.
Base logs confirmed he did.

26:42.396 --> 26:44.964
Dixon wasn't even in the States
when his I.D. was scanned.

26:45.032 --> 26:47.433
Apollyon wanted us
at Dixon's house to take us out.

26:47.501 --> 26:48.811
I guess he wasn't
a traitor after all.

26:48.835 --> 26:50.169
But someone is.

26:50.237 --> 26:51.547
Well, whoever they were,
they had access

26:51.571 --> 26:52.938
to the SCIF feed
at Belle Chasse.

26:53.006 --> 26:54.273
Yeah, we may
have to look

26:54.341 --> 26:56.108
a little higher up
the food chain.

26:56.176 --> 26:57.520
Somebody with
major security clearance.

26:57.544 --> 26:58.821
Doc Wade's got
the hit-squad bodies.

26:58.845 --> 27:00.212
Maybe she's got something.

27:00.280 --> 27:01.924
- Yeah, I'm gonna go find out.
PATTON: Good.

27:01.948 --> 27:03.883
'Cause Apollyon
is not done with us yet.

27:08.622 --> 27:10.489
(panting)

27:10.557 --> 27:12.491
We should keep moving.
Get to the border.

27:12.559 --> 27:14.160
Yeah, sun is setting.

27:14.227 --> 27:16.228
We're not gonna be able
to make it before dark.

27:16.296 --> 27:18.230
You won't be able
to find a path?

27:18.298 --> 27:19.675
Hey, I can track a buck
in the pitch-black.

27:19.699 --> 27:21.801
Not sure I can do the same
for a border checkpoint.

27:21.868 --> 27:23.536
All right.

27:23.603 --> 27:25.371
Let's stop here.

27:25.439 --> 27:26.949
All right, we'll spend
the night in that barn.

27:26.973 --> 27:28.474
It'll be safer.

27:28.542 --> 27:30.376
Okay.

27:30.444 --> 27:32.178
Okay.

27:45.058 --> 27:47.426
PRIDE: Looks like they're down
for the night.

27:47.494 --> 27:49.428
(exhales)

27:49.496 --> 27:51.430
(Isler panting)

27:51.498 --> 27:53.365
You holding up?

27:53.433 --> 27:54.934
Uh...

27:55.001 --> 27:56.902
Nothing a week
in a hospital won't fix.

27:56.970 --> 27:58.237
(chuckles)

27:58.305 --> 28:00.072
Lucky to be alive, Raymond.

28:00.140 --> 28:01.740
ISLER:
Wasn't luck.

28:01.808 --> 28:03.175
It's been eating at me
ever since

28:03.243 --> 28:04.710
we walked out
of that ambush alive.

28:04.778 --> 28:07.379
(grunts)
What has?

28:07.447 --> 28:09.014
The fact that
I never should have.

28:10.584 --> 28:12.618
We were fish in a barrel.

28:12.686 --> 28:14.954
- Why wasn't I killed?
- You're thinking

28:15.021 --> 28:17.256
Apollyon wanted you to survive?

28:20.927 --> 28:23.696
Well, how did you end up
with the militia?

28:23.763 --> 28:25.931
Assuming they were tipped off.

28:25.999 --> 28:27.633
They knew exactly
where to find me.

28:27.701 --> 28:30.936
This was all a setup
to draw you out.

28:31.004 --> 28:32.805
We're the only
two left...

28:32.873 --> 28:34.940
who had access...

28:35.008 --> 28:38.410
to the full extent of intel
from Amelia Parsons' tattoo.

28:40.213 --> 28:42.648
Walker wants anyone
who's seen it dead.

28:42.716 --> 28:46.152
Please tell me
that you did not share it.

28:46.219 --> 28:48.087
No, but...

28:48.155 --> 28:49.588
it hardly matters.

28:49.656 --> 28:51.157
Walker's gonna cover his bets.

28:51.224 --> 28:53.259
The team's in danger.

28:53.326 --> 28:55.728
Your team...

28:55.795 --> 28:57.129
can handle themselves.

28:58.798 --> 29:00.966
You've given them
all the necessary tools.

29:01.034 --> 29:03.569
LASALLE: I think I
found a way to the border.

29:03.637 --> 29:05.271
All right.

29:05.338 --> 29:07.139
So we're right here.

29:07.207 --> 29:08.474
So, we'll take
the woods

29:08.542 --> 29:10.609
straight to...
Little Liakhvi River.

29:10.677 --> 29:12.912
It flows right down into

29:12.979 --> 29:15.314
the Georgian Republic.
- Yeah, exactly.

29:15.382 --> 29:16.916
It's not the
straightest path, but...

29:16.983 --> 29:19.451
but it'd be harder
for them to track us.

29:19.519 --> 29:21.453
Need to get some rest.

29:21.521 --> 29:23.489
(grunts) Sleep in shifts.

29:23.557 --> 29:25.157
I'll take first watch.

29:30.730 --> 29:32.665
Please tell me
you made contact with Dwayne.

29:32.732 --> 29:34.366
Well, if he and the others
are alive,

29:34.434 --> 29:36.512
they're flying blind out there.
We need to help them.

29:36.536 --> 29:38.304
Agreed, but how?

29:38.371 --> 29:39.882
Anything from these guys
who tried to kill us?

29:39.906 --> 29:42.141
Can you I.D. them?
Track where they came from?

29:42.209 --> 29:43.842
You know how Apollyon operates.

29:43.910 --> 29:45.377
Prints lead nowhere.

29:45.445 --> 29:48.147
Dental work is custom.

29:48.215 --> 29:49.615
DNA has no matches.

29:49.683 --> 29:51.617
Like they've never even existed.
(sighs)

29:51.685 --> 29:53.619
There is a "however."

29:53.687 --> 29:55.621
Someone's been keeping tabs
on these men.

29:55.689 --> 29:57.656
I found...

29:57.724 --> 29:59.858
injection marks

29:59.926 --> 30:02.228
on each one of
their thumbs.

30:02.295 --> 30:04.396
These were
implanted in them.

30:05.765 --> 30:07.399
Looks like an RFID chip.

30:07.467 --> 30:08.911
HANNAH:
Radio-frequency identification.

30:08.935 --> 30:10.569
Tracking their movements?

30:10.637 --> 30:12.238
I think it's more than that.

30:12.305 --> 30:14.306
Go, go.

30:17.244 --> 30:19.345
You're gonna
clue us in, Sebastian?

30:19.412 --> 30:21.190
Yeah, I went through
the operatives' equipment

30:21.214 --> 30:23.349
back at Dixon's house,
including their smartphones.

30:23.416 --> 30:24.750
They wouldn't switch on.

30:24.818 --> 30:26.085
Damaged in the gunfight?

30:26.152 --> 30:28.187
No, they just wouldn't activate.
But now...

30:28.255 --> 30:30.155
I think I know why.

30:30.223 --> 30:33.225
(beeps)
Yeah.

30:33.293 --> 30:35.160
That chip is
a personalized passcode.

30:35.228 --> 30:36.662
It's a fail-safe.

30:36.730 --> 30:38.207
If equipment
falls in the wrong hands,

30:38.231 --> 30:39.665
it can't be used
against Apollyon.

30:39.733 --> 30:41.433
Do you think Patton

30:41.501 --> 30:44.603
can use this unit to get a lock
on Apollyon's encrypted feed?

30:44.671 --> 30:45.982
Well, if he can,
then we can maybe

30:46.006 --> 30:47.766
figure out where Walker
and his men are, too.

30:50.110 --> 30:53.012
(horse nickers)

30:53.079 --> 30:55.381
(rooster crows)
(gasps)

30:55.448 --> 30:59.718
(grunting)

30:59.786 --> 31:02.288
Ow...

31:02.355 --> 31:03.956
Hey.

31:04.024 --> 31:06.025
Nobody woke me
for my shift, man.

31:06.092 --> 31:08.360
Executive decision.

31:08.428 --> 31:10.896
Told Christopher you needed
to get some rest.

31:10.964 --> 31:13.565
(exhales)
Hey, I'm sorry about this.

31:13.633 --> 31:14.315
What?

31:14.339 --> 31:16.397
Dwayne, getting you involved
in the task force,

31:16.398 --> 31:19.000
and dragging you back
into all this.

31:19.067 --> 31:20.568
We've always-- hey.
(gasps)

31:20.636 --> 31:22.336
It's okay.
We're good.

31:23.972 --> 31:25.840
We've always
underestimated Apollyon.

31:25.907 --> 31:28.175
But that ends now.

31:30.579 --> 31:32.546
We get back,

31:32.614 --> 31:35.016
take the fight
to Walker.

31:35.083 --> 31:36.684
ISLER: Can't tell
you how many times

31:36.752 --> 31:39.120
I was sure I was dead
in the last few days.

31:39.187 --> 31:42.056
I think I made my peace with it.

31:42.124 --> 31:43.958
I don't want to die.

31:44.026 --> 31:46.560
But I'd accept it.

31:47.422 --> 31:49.523
The worst part of surviving...

31:49.591 --> 31:51.118
was I was sure that
you were gonna come

31:51.119 --> 31:52.453
looking for me.

31:52.920 --> 31:55.188
Raymond...
- The last thing I wanted

31:55.256 --> 31:56.690
to do was put you in danger.

31:56.758 --> 31:58.125
And yet, strangely...

32:00.628 --> 32:02.929
I knew that you were
my only hope of surviving.

32:04.999 --> 32:06.266
You'd do the same for me.

32:06.334 --> 32:08.268
Well...

32:08.336 --> 32:10.304
I mean, I kind of
have to say that now,

32:10.371 --> 32:11.805
under the circumstances.

32:11.873 --> 32:14.541
(vehicle approaching)

32:20.315 --> 32:21.982
Apollyon?

32:22.050 --> 32:23.984
No. It's militia.

32:31.693 --> 32:33.593
(man speaking Russian)

32:37.532 --> 32:39.599
We got to go.

32:39.667 --> 32:41.234
Yeah.

32:41.302 --> 32:42.402
Come on, we got to go.

32:42.470 --> 32:44.438
Okay. (groans)

32:44.505 --> 32:45.639
(panting)

32:59.193 --> 33:00.664
_

33:00.688 --> 33:03.218
_

33:03.390 --> 33:04.595
_

33:04.619 --> 33:06.460
_

33:08.045 --> 33:09.657
_

33:10.456 --> 33:11.898
Christopher?

33:12.193 --> 33:13.927
It's gonna be all right.

33:13.995 --> 33:15.629
Come on. Huh?

33:16.964 --> 33:19.066
(mutters)

33:19.133 --> 33:21.034
ISLER: I think she knows
not to accept

33:21.102 --> 33:23.303
candy from strangers
hiding in her barn.

33:23.371 --> 33:24.411
LASALLE:
I guess we'll have

33:24.472 --> 33:26.740
to up the ante.

33:26.808 --> 33:29.142
Look. Hmm?

33:38.152 --> 33:39.286
Papa!

33:55.002 --> 33:57.304
(engine starts)

34:03.411 --> 34:04.845
She did good.

34:04.912 --> 34:07.347
For a thousand dollars,
I'd sure hope so.

34:07.415 --> 34:09.349
Let's get out of here.

34:09.417 --> 34:11.351
(grunts)

34:25.166 --> 34:26.766
(panting)

34:26.833 --> 34:28.601
That's our river.

34:28.668 --> 34:31.505
Yeah, we maintain this pace,

34:31.572 --> 34:33.306
we'll be back in Georgia
within the hour.

34:33.373 --> 34:35.842
Militia will have trouble
tracking us by the water,

34:35.909 --> 34:38.011
but we'll be exposed
to the gunship.

34:38.079 --> 34:40.880
LASALLE: The border can't be more than
two or three klicks downriver.

34:40.947 --> 34:43.949
Then let's get going.

34:44.018 --> 34:45.762
PATTON: <i>Pride and the others</i>
<i>are still alive.</i>

34:45.786 --> 34:47.426
- At least for now.
- How can you be sure?

34:47.455 --> 34:48.989
Walker's not playing around.

34:49.056 --> 34:53.059
His network is protected
by a 256 AES encryption.

34:53.127 --> 34:55.629
Yeah, but the RFID chip that
we got let Patton exploit it.

34:55.696 --> 34:57.063
We got access
to their comms now.

34:57.130 --> 34:58.303
And the order to attack you guys

34:58.304 --> 35:00.657
in Dixon's house
came from South Ossetia.

35:00.658 --> 35:02.326
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, we're sure.

35:02.393 --> 35:04.138
All their communications
are coming through this point

35:04.162 --> 35:05.262
right here.

35:07.665 --> 35:10.467
That's where Isler's task force
was taken out.

35:10.535 --> 35:12.469
Avery Walker's hideout.

35:12.537 --> 35:14.671
What's that?

35:14.739 --> 35:15.672
Trouble.

35:15.740 --> 35:17.508
Apollyon helicopter.

35:17.575 --> 35:19.553
I was able to tap into
their real-time communications

35:19.577 --> 35:21.278
a few minutes ago.

35:21.346 --> 35:23.747
HOME BASE: Jäger Two-Six,
any sign of the targets?

35:23.815 --> 35:26.583
PILOT: Negative. Brush is thick.
Gonna take another pass.

35:26.651 --> 35:30.254
HOME BASE: Roger. Radio silence
until you make contact. Over.

35:30.321 --> 35:31.999
- That's all we got.
- Yeah, but it sounds like

35:32.023 --> 35:34.291
Pride, Isler
and Lasalle are still alive.

35:34.359 --> 35:35.536
If they are,
they're being hunted

35:35.560 --> 35:37.027
by Apollyon and the militia.

35:37.095 --> 35:39.663
Can you pull up the location
of my last contact with Pride?

35:42.700 --> 35:44.345
That's the site of
the Isler exchange, and this

35:44.369 --> 35:46.470
is the current location

35:46.538 --> 35:47.771
of that Apollyon aircraft.

35:47.839 --> 35:49.840
Well, if they're hunting Pride,

35:49.908 --> 35:52.709
that's the direction
he went running.

35:52.777 --> 35:54.778
- Son of a...
- What? What happened?

35:54.846 --> 35:56.056
They discovered
that we were in their system,

35:56.080 --> 35:57.181
they gave us the boot.

35:57.248 --> 35:58.782
That's okay.

35:58.850 --> 36:00.884
I know where Pride's headed,
and how to help him.

36:03.054 --> 36:05.189
You gonna share with
the rest of the class?

36:15.967 --> 36:17.201
You see someone?

36:17.268 --> 36:20.404
No. But I see a way
to get home faster.

36:34.619 --> 36:36.353
(gunshot)

36:36.421 --> 36:39.056
Christopher!

36:48.466 --> 36:50.234
You all right?

36:50.301 --> 36:52.502
Yeah, it just stings.

36:55.473 --> 36:57.074
Isler?

36:57.141 --> 36:58.141
I think I got grazed.

37:00.778 --> 37:02.179
We need to get in the boat.

37:04.816 --> 37:05.916
I'll draw their fire.

37:05.984 --> 37:07.161
We're not leaving you, Dwayne!

37:07.185 --> 37:08.719
You're gonna get
across that border,

37:08.786 --> 37:10.397
then you're gonna come back
for me with backup.

37:10.421 --> 37:12.389
And that's an order,
Christopher.

37:12.457 --> 37:13.390
Are we really gonna do this?

37:13.458 --> 37:15.092
He's not wrong.

37:15.159 --> 37:17.394
Ready? Go.

37:21.466 --> 37:22.532
(engine starts)

37:32.810 --> 37:34.144
(gun clicking empty)

37:42.838 --> 37:43.843
_

37:45.062 --> 37:47.283
_

38:05.133 --> 38:06.734
(men shouting in Russian
in distance)

38:07.102 --> 38:09.169
Damn.

38:09.237 --> 38:09.792
(panting)

38:09.793 --> 38:12.394
(quietly):
I need bullets.

38:33.683 --> 38:35.617
LASALLE:
We're at the border, Isler.

38:35.685 --> 38:37.619
We made it.

38:42.625 --> 38:44.993
(grunting)

38:45.061 --> 38:47.295
I'm gonna get in touch
with Hannah.

38:47.363 --> 38:49.331
Get her to bring
Special Forces for Pride.

38:49.399 --> 38:51.466
Lasalle. We got a problem.

38:53.469 --> 38:55.904
I guess I wasn't
grazed after all.

38:55.972 --> 38:59.641
We're gonna find the bleeding,
uh, and get it stopped.

38:59.709 --> 39:01.343
Okay. Yeah, sounds
simple enough, huh?

39:01.411 --> 39:02.944
(vehicles approaching)

39:05.415 --> 39:07.916
Friend or foe?

39:07.984 --> 39:10.085
I'll guess we'll find out.

39:10.153 --> 39:12.020
What are you gonna do?

39:13.856 --> 39:15.123
Improvise.

39:23.066 --> 39:25.100
We-We're Americans.

39:36.679 --> 39:39.181
That's going to leave a mark.

39:39.248 --> 39:41.683
Flesh wound.

39:41.751 --> 39:43.552
You survived?

39:43.619 --> 39:45.387
I snuck away
during the firefight.

39:45.455 --> 39:48.023
I made my way across
the border last night.

39:48.091 --> 39:51.693
Your friend Hannah called to say
that you might show up here.

39:52.795 --> 39:55.363
Isler, you hear that?

39:55.431 --> 39:57.365
Isler?

40:01.738 --> 40:04.973
Isler. This man
needs medical attention.

40:05.041 --> 40:07.008
Hey. Isler.

40:07.076 --> 40:08.977
Come on, man.
Stay with me.

40:09.045 --> 40:10.178
Where's Pride?

40:37.273 --> 40:39.608
(speaking Russian)

40:57.994 --> 41:00.695
(bird cawing)

41:01.964 --> 41:03.899
(exhales)

41:11.374 --> 41:13.408
(gun clicks)

41:22.285 --> 41:24.219
(panting)

41:43.873 --> 41:46.107
There will be no ransom for you.

41:46.175 --> 41:48.476
(gunshots)

41:48.544 --> 41:50.946
(glass shatters)

41:52.481 --> 41:54.182
Huh?

42:06.996 --> 42:08.463
Walker.

42:09.398 --> 42:11.166
Dwayne.

42:11.234 --> 42:13.168
Nice to see you again.
