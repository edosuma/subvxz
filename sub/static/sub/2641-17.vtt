WEBVTT

00:02.239 --> 00:04.172
Why do I always have to
carry the heavy stuff?

00:04.909 --> 00:05.676
Well, it's very simple.

00:05.710 --> 00:08.765
In our ragtag band of scientists
with nothing to lose,

00:08.800 --> 00:10.219
I'm the smart one,

00:10.254 --> 00:11.583
Wolowitz is the funny one,

00:11.618 --> 00:13.684
and Koothrappali
is the lovable foreigner

00:13.719 --> 00:16.183
who struggles to understand
our ways and fails.

00:18.486 --> 00:20.884
That leaves you,
by default, as the muscle.

00:20.919 --> 00:22.153
Oh.

00:22.188 --> 00:25.265
One more floor,
and I'd be the pulled muscle.

00:26.300 --> 00:27.636
Oh, it's
about time.

00:27.670 --> 00:28.872
I'm starving.

00:28.906 --> 00:31.447
Um, well, we didn't
actually get Chinese food.

00:31.481 --> 00:32.948
Why not?
Don't panic.

00:32.982 --> 00:34.087
This is better.

00:34.122 --> 00:35.288
Oh, no.

00:35.323 --> 00:37.591
You didn't trade the food
for magic beans, did you?

00:37.626 --> 00:40.229
Of course not.

00:40.263 --> 00:42.099
And technically,
magic beans would be food.

00:42.134 --> 00:44.234
Although eating them
would be quite a waste,

00:44.269 --> 00:45.603
since you could plant them,

00:45.637 --> 00:47.171
and overnight,
have a giant beanstalk,

00:47.205 --> 00:50.073
which would provide enough
roughage for a small city.

00:50.108 --> 00:52.308
Yeah, sometimes I don't listen.

00:52.343 --> 00:54.978
Sometimes I just watch
your jaw go up and down.

00:56.246 --> 00:58.147
We were on our way to
the Chinese restaurant

00:58.181 --> 01:00.515
when we thought we saw Adam
West, so we followed him.

01:00.550 --> 01:01.649
Who's Adam West?

01:01.684 --> 01:03.852
Who's Adam West?!

01:03.886 --> 01:07.157
Leonard, what do the two of you
talk about after the coitus?

01:08.593 --> 01:10.761
My guess is,
"Hey, four minutes!

01:10.796 --> 01:12.364
New record!"

01:13.568 --> 01:17.505
That's why I'm
the funny one.

01:17.539 --> 01:19.976
Anyway, we followed the guy
to this garage sale,

01:20.011 --> 01:21.545
and they had the coolest stuff.

01:21.579 --> 01:22.646
They were closing up.

01:22.680 --> 01:24.516
We got this whole
box for 60 bucks.

01:24.550 --> 01:25.917
We didn't even get
to go through it all.

01:25.952 --> 01:27.219
There could be
anything in here.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.588
There a new girlfriend in there?

01:28.622 --> 01:29.957
'Cause you might need one.

01:29.991 --> 01:31.792
No.

01:31.827 --> 01:35.163
But there is an
original final draft
<i>Ghostbusters</i> script

01:35.198 --> 01:36.899
with actual
slime stains!

01:37.800 --> 01:39.401
Oh, you're right.

01:39.436 --> 01:40.637
It's <i>Ghostbusters 2.</i>

01:40.671 --> 01:41.905
Never mind.

01:41.940 --> 01:44.942
Oh, my God.

01:47.981 --> 01:50.483
An Alf doll.

01:51.385 --> 01:53.486
When I was 11,
my mother got me one

01:53.521 --> 01:54.621
to help me sleep

01:54.655 --> 01:56.123
after my dad left.

01:56.157 --> 01:57.458
I used to pretend

01:57.493 --> 02:00.361
that my dad had moved
to the planet Melmac,

02:00.396 --> 02:04.767
and Alf was going
to bring him back to me.

02:04.801 --> 02:07.070
But he never did.

02:07.738 --> 02:10.306
Where's my daddy, puppet?

02:13.812 --> 02:15.946
Where is he?

02:16.814 --> 02:18.815
That is so sad.

02:18.850 --> 02:21.017
No, what's sad is
that you don't know

02:21.052 --> 02:23.987

02:59.773 --> 03:02.541
Oh, yeah, here's Spock's body
with Mr. T's head.

(laughs)

03:03.943 --> 03:05.277
(laughter)

03:05.311 --> 03:07.813
I pity the fool
who's illogical.

03:08.548 --> 03:10.382
(laughter)

03:10.416 --> 03:13.451
Okay, I'm just
gonna go home

03:13.485 --> 03:15.553
and make a grilled
cheese and window-shop

03:15.588 --> 03:17.688
on eHarmony.

03:18.690 --> 03:20.224
Okay, bye.

03:20.258 --> 03:21.825
Okay.

03:21.860 --> 03:25.262
Ooh, look, an Indiana Jones
connect-the-dots.

03:25.296 --> 03:27.430
And an Aquaman
action figure.

03:27.465 --> 03:29.732
Looks like someone
drew a penis on him.

03:29.766 --> 03:31.934
Ooh, that'll come off.

Advertise your product or brand here

03:40.811 --> 03:43.113
You see what you're doing?

03:43.147 --> 03:45.582
Stop that.

03:45.616 --> 03:46.850
Fascinating.

03:46.884 --> 03:48.218
What?

03:48.252 --> 03:50.654
It appears
to be a <i>Lord of the Rings ring.</i>

03:50.688 --> 03:52.156
Oh.
It's even got

03:52.190 --> 03:53.724
the Elvish engraving on it.

03:53.758 --> 03:55.058
It's not Elvish.

03:55.093 --> 03:58.296
It's the language of Mordor
written in Elvish script.

03:59.632 --> 04:02.467
"One Ring to
rule them all."

04:02.501 --> 04:05.070
"One Ring to find them."

04:05.104 --> 04:07.673
"One Ring to bring them all."

04:07.707 --> 04:11.210
"And in the darkness bind them."

04:12.579 --> 04:15.180
Holy crap,
are we nerdy.

04:17.350 --> 04:19.485
So, I was doing some checking
on the ring.

04:19.519 --> 04:21.720
Hold on. Sheldon, is there
ketchup on that table?

04:21.755 --> 04:23.989
Yes, there is.

04:24.023 --> 04:25.757
Oh, here's a fun fact.

04:25.792 --> 04:27.058
Ketchup started out

04:27.093 --> 04:28.560
as a general term for sauce,

04:28.595 --> 04:30.563
typically made of mushrooms
or fish brine

04:30.597 --> 04:31.864
with herbs and spices.

04:31.898 --> 04:34.600
Some popular early main
ingredients included blueberry,

04:34.634 --> 04:38.103
anchovy, oyster,
kidney bean and grape.

04:39.406 --> 04:42.074
No, that's okay. I'll get it.

04:42.109 --> 04:45.478
Listen, I was looking
at the ring, and it

04:45.512 --> 04:46.678
seemed a little weird.

04:46.713 --> 04:48.247
No copyright notice on it.

04:48.281 --> 04:51.751
So, I took it down to this buddy
of mine who deals with--

04:51.785 --> 04:53.753
shall we say--
the seedy underbelly

04:53.787 --> 04:55.354
of the collectibles world.

04:55.388 --> 04:56.822
Seedy underbelly?

04:56.856 --> 04:59.191
You know,
your black market phasers,

04:59.226 --> 05:01.360
your screen-worn
Lieutenant Uhura panties,

05:01.394 --> 05:02.728
that kind of stuff.

05:03.831 --> 05:04.964
(clears throat)

05:04.998 --> 05:06.933
Who's this mysterious
buddy you suddenly have?

05:06.967 --> 05:09.002
Just a guy. I know a guy.

05:09.036 --> 05:11.705
Is it Eddie Crispo?
No, I can't
tell you who it is. Stop asking.

05:11.739 --> 05:13.340
Who else could it be?
It has to be Eddie Crispo.

05:13.374 --> 05:15.442
I know lots
of dangerous people, okay?

05:15.476 --> 05:18.511
Name one.
Eddie Crispo.

05:18.545 --> 05:20.012
Anyway,

05:20.047 --> 05:21.914
he said this isn't a replica.

05:21.949 --> 05:24.617
It's the real deal.

05:24.652 --> 05:27.587
If you're suggesting that
that is the actual ring of power

05:27.621 --> 05:29.856
forged by Sauron in Mount Doom,

05:29.890 --> 05:32.291
I look at you
with an expression of exhaustion

05:32.325 --> 05:34.326
and ever so slight amusement.

05:34.360 --> 05:36.028
(small, airy laugh)

05:37.431 --> 05:40.299
He's not saying
it's a magic ring.

05:40.334 --> 05:42.235
You're not, are you?

05:42.269 --> 05:44.270
No, but it's close.

05:44.304 --> 05:45.771
Look at the markings inside.

05:45.806 --> 05:48.073
Those are
production
markings.

05:48.108 --> 05:51.043
Nine rings were made for use
in the <i>Lord of the Rings movies.</i>

05:51.077 --> 05:52.878
Three were given
to members of the cast.

05:52.912 --> 05:54.346
The rest were destroyed.

05:54.381 --> 05:56.082
Except one.

05:56.116 --> 05:58.818
One was stolen.

05:58.852 --> 06:00.887
Gentlemen...

06:00.921 --> 06:04.457
this is the one ring.

06:06.560 --> 06:09.295
Mine!

06:10.664 --> 06:11.898
No, it is not yours.

06:11.932 --> 06:13.533
We all went in
on the box together.

06:13.567 --> 06:15.868
Well, yes, but I
found it in the box,

06:15.903 --> 06:17.971
and the laws of maritime
salvage clearly state

06:18.005 --> 06:19.873
that the finder of
a sunken treasure

06:19.907 --> 06:21.475
is the owner
of the treasure.

06:21.509 --> 06:23.377
How is this maritime salvage?

06:23.411 --> 06:25.812
Other than the lack of
water, how is it not?

06:25.846 --> 06:28.348
Wait, wait. Sheldon, stop
being crazy for a second.

06:28.382 --> 06:30.516
How much is something
like this worth?

06:30.551 --> 06:33.152
Well, it's tough to say
since it's hot,

06:33.186 --> 06:35.254
but on the underground market,
my guy figures...

06:35.288 --> 06:36.288
Your guy Eddie Crispo?

06:36.322 --> 06:38.489
s.

06:39.725 --> 06:44.361
He figures ten,
maybe 15 thousand.

06:44.396 --> 06:45.863
Okay, that's a lot of money.

06:45.897 --> 06:48.998
The wise thing to do is invest
it in something practical.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.733
Like a jet ski.

06:50.767 --> 06:53.702
Why do you want a jet ski?

06:53.737 --> 06:57.039
All the wealthy and beautiful
people in movies ride Jet Skis.

06:57.073 --> 06:58.841
That can't just
be a coincidence.

06:59.776 --> 07:00.943
We can't sell it.

07:00.978 --> 07:02.545
We have to keep it

07:02.579 --> 07:03.846
and love it and polish it,

07:03.880 --> 07:05.314
and only take it out
occasionally

07:05.348 --> 07:06.648
when we go to the park

07:06.683 --> 07:09.652
and reenact our favorite scenes
from the movies.

07:09.686 --> 07:13.723
It's sad how great that sounds.

07:13.757 --> 07:14.891
Guys, it's stolen.

07:14.925 --> 07:16.526
It should go back
to Peter Jackson.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.361
He made the movies;
it belongs to him.

07:18.395 --> 07:19.562
WOLOWITZ:
Fine.

07:19.596 --> 07:21.931
He can have it back
as long as he promises

07:21.965 --> 07:24.200
to make me a hobbit
in his next movie.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.302
There are no
Jewish hobbits.

07:26.336 --> 07:28.171
Clearly, you've never
been to my house

07:28.205 --> 07:30.440
for dinner
on Rosh Hashanah.

07:30.474 --> 07:32.842
We are not blackmailing
Peter J...

07:32.876 --> 07:34.343
All right,
where's the ring?

07:34.377 --> 07:36.612
You mean my ring?

07:36.646 --> 07:37.713
What are you doing?

07:37.748 --> 07:38.881
The ring was
unguarded.

07:38.916 --> 07:40.650
It was just sitting
on the table.

07:40.684 --> 07:42.118
Anyone could
have taken it.

07:42.152 --> 07:44.053
Proof? I did.

07:44.087 --> 07:46.622
Give me that.
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Look, let's be reasonable.

07:46.656 --> 07:48.990
We all want to do
different things with the ring,

07:49.025 --> 07:51.927
but your ideas are stupid,
and I want a jet ski.

07:51.961 --> 07:53.662
I found it. The
ring is mine.

07:53.696 --> 07:56.999
I don't understand
why in this group I
never get my way.

08:00.402 --> 08:03.572
You always get your way.

08:03.606 --> 08:07.876
I'll stipulate to that
if you give me the ring.

08:07.911 --> 08:09.011
Hey, guys.

08:09.045 --> 08:10.379
Enjoying your food
that I actually

08:10.413 --> 08:12.047
brought you
instead of promising food,

08:12.081 --> 08:15.183
but bringing you a box
of random crap?

08:15.218 --> 08:16.318
Yeah, it's delicious.

08:16.352 --> 08:18.153
The sarcasm's
a little stale, though.

08:19.321 --> 08:20.454
Hey, how about this?

08:20.489 --> 08:22.323
Until we figure out
what to do with the ring,

08:22.357 --> 08:23.490
Penny holds on to it.

08:23.525 --> 08:24.391
What ring?

08:24.425 --> 08:26.560
This ring.

08:26.594 --> 08:28.728
Looking for something?

08:30.964 --> 08:33.265
Will you hold on to this
for a couple of days?

08:33.299 --> 08:34.900
Why?
It's a prop

08:34.934 --> 08:36.869
from a movie, and we're kind of
fighting over it.

08:36.903 --> 08:38.571
Okay, just to be clear,
the first piece of jewelry

08:38.605 --> 08:40.304
my boyfriend gives me
is a prop from a movie,

08:40.340 --> 08:41.807
and I don't even get to keep it?

08:42.808 --> 08:45.478
If you had gone out with me
three years ago,

08:45.512 --> 08:47.913
by now, you'd have
my great Aunt Ida's brooch

08:47.947 --> 08:51.483
that she smuggled out
of occupied Belgium in a cat.

08:52.618 --> 08:54.787
How am I looking now?

08:57.557 --> 08:59.624
(door opening)

09:09.568 --> 09:11.702
(sighs)

09:18.845 --> 09:21.914
(buzzing like a mosquito)

09:21.948 --> 09:24.083
(soft groan)

09:51.078 --> 09:52.645
(screams)

09:52.679 --> 09:53.946
Ow!

09:53.981 --> 09:56.216
Oh!

09:57.519 --> 09:59.754
You hit me!

09:59.788 --> 10:02.958
I'm bleeding!

10:03.893 --> 10:05.661
What was that?

10:05.695 --> 10:08.632
Sheldon tried to take the ring
and I punched him.

10:08.666 --> 10:11.835
That's my girl.

10:17.352 --> 10:19.254
So, Sheldon,

10:19.288 --> 10:22.456
how's it feel to get
beaten up by a girl?

10:25.360 --> 10:27.261
It's not the first time.

10:27.295 --> 10:30.697
I have a twin sister
whose assaults began in utero.

10:31.866 --> 10:34.834
If only I'd had the presence
of mind to reabsorb her,

10:34.868 --> 10:36.869
then I'd have a mole
with hair in it

10:36.903 --> 10:40.306
instead of a tedious
yearly Christmas letter.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.675
Gentlemen, have you come
to the realization

10:42.710 --> 10:44.511
that the only reasonable
course of action

10:44.545 --> 10:46.312
is to sell the ring
and divide the money?

10:46.347 --> 10:47.480
No.

10:47.515 --> 10:48.548
I was afraid of that.

10:48.582 --> 10:50.550
(clears throat)

10:50.584 --> 10:52.519
Go ahead.

10:52.553 --> 10:54.154
Greetings from Mumbai.

10:54.189 --> 10:56.657
I am Raj's attorney,
Venkatesh Koothrappali.

10:56.692 --> 10:58.693
Also my cousin.

10:58.727 --> 11:00.162
You brought a lawyer?

11:00.196 --> 11:01.396
Don't answer that.

11:01.430 --> 11:03.364
I'll get straight
to the point.

11:03.398 --> 11:05.400
My client's prepared
to surrender

11:05.434 --> 11:06.868
any interest
he has in the ring

11:06.902 --> 11:09.604
in exchange for two
Kawasaki Jet Skis.

11:09.638 --> 11:12.640
We're not giving him
two Jet Skis.

11:12.674 --> 11:14.642
Look, we're big boys,

11:14.676 --> 11:16.844
why don't we just cut to the
chase and meet in the middle?

11:16.879 --> 11:18.146
One Kawasaki Jet Ski.

11:18.180 --> 11:19.313
Done and done.

11:21.316 --> 11:23.952
No Jet Skis.

11:23.986 --> 11:26.054
All right, forget
the Jet Skis.

11:26.088 --> 11:27.322
Forget the Jet Skis?

11:27.356 --> 11:28.823
That was our line
in the sand!

11:28.858 --> 11:30.725
What happened to
"tear them a new one?"

11:30.760 --> 11:31.926
What can I say?

11:31.960 --> 11:33.294
They played hardball.

11:33.328 --> 11:34.562
We lost.

11:34.596 --> 11:35.897
You're useless.

11:35.931 --> 11:37.732
I told you that
when you hired me.

11:37.767 --> 11:39.200
KOOTHRAPPALI:
I'm signing off now.

11:39.235 --> 11:40.568
Call your mother.

11:40.603 --> 11:42.203
She worries.

11:43.439 --> 11:44.606
Okay, just so
you know,

11:44.641 --> 11:47.009
if we're bringing in cousins
who are lawyers,

11:47.043 --> 11:50.079
prepare for shock and awe.

11:50.113 --> 11:51.914
You know what?
I am ending this.

11:51.948 --> 11:53.382
Penny didn't want to
hold the ring anymore.

11:53.416 --> 11:54.716
She gave it to me.
I have it.

11:54.751 --> 11:56.285
I'm sending it back.

11:56.319 --> 11:57.987
Where's the ring?

11:58.021 --> 12:00.456
You mean this ring?

12:01.558 --> 12:03.259
Next time be aware
of your surroundings

12:03.294 --> 12:05.462
while urinating
in a public men's room.

12:05.496 --> 12:06.663
Give me that.

12:06.697 --> 12:07.697
No, it's mine.

12:07.731 --> 12:08.631
It's all of ours.

12:08.666 --> 12:10.800
(grunting and groaning)

12:10.835 --> 12:12.636
Okay, now, this is ridiculous!
Then let go!

12:12.670 --> 12:14.004
I'm not letting go.
You let go.

12:14.038 --> 12:15.472
I say this ring belongs

12:15.506 --> 12:17.541
to the last person
who can hold on.

12:17.575 --> 12:19.743
Fine. But can't we go home
and start this?

12:19.777 --> 12:20.944
Sure.

12:20.978 --> 12:22.278
Let go of the ring.

12:22.313 --> 12:24.814
All right, it starts now.

12:28.820 --> 12:31.687
You do realize there's
a giant bug movie marathon

12:31.722 --> 12:33.956
tonight on the Syfy Channel.

12:48.672 --> 12:50.774
Wait, my laptop.

13:01.453 --> 13:04.354
You know, there's a point
when this becomes idiotic.

13:04.389 --> 13:07.624
And it wasn't when we were
driving like this?

13:08.893 --> 13:10.861
I would advise
the three of you

13:10.895 --> 13:12.495
that resistance
is futile.

13:12.530 --> 13:14.164
I have endless
patience.

13:14.198 --> 13:16.399
I once spent two-and-a-half
hours on hold

13:16.433 --> 13:18.400
with Hewlett-Packard
customer service

13:18.435 --> 13:21.571
just to complain about
their customer service.

13:23.073 --> 13:25.074
You want to talk about
endless patience?

13:25.108 --> 13:27.110
Penny made me watch
all five seasons

13:27.144 --> 13:29.278
of <i>Sex and the City.</i>

13:31.415 --> 13:33.382
There are six
seasons, dude.

13:33.417 --> 13:35.552
Oh, crap!

13:37.054 --> 13:39.022
No, no, no, the sixth
season is great.

13:39.056 --> 13:43.092
We go to Paris with Carrie
and get our heart broken,

13:43.127 --> 13:44.327
and then Mr. Big shows up,

13:44.361 --> 13:47.330
we don't know if we
can trust him again.

13:47.364 --> 13:49.532
It's a wild ride.

13:51.435 --> 13:53.569
Door.

13:55.973 --> 13:57.073
(keys jingling)

13:57.107 --> 13:59.409
(sighs)

13:59.443 --> 14:02.812
Okay, everybody,
and plié.

14:09.853 --> 14:11.988
And relevé.

14:14.892 --> 14:17.961
Whatcha doin'?

14:17.995 --> 14:20.731
Last one holding the ring
decides its fate.

14:20.765 --> 14:21.965
I know, it sounds silly.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.901
No, no, no, no, no,
you are my boyfriend.

14:23.935 --> 14:25.936
Nothing you do is silly to me.

14:25.970 --> 14:27.871
Thank you.

14:27.906 --> 14:32.676
FYI-- this is a bag
from Victoria's Secret.

14:38.850 --> 14:41.785
I'm out.

14:51.362 --> 14:53.330
I'm sorry, Ma,

14:53.364 --> 14:55.332
I have to stay late
at the office.

14:55.366 --> 14:57.668
No, he's doesn't!
He's lying to you!

14:58.836 --> 15:00.470
Will you be quiet?

15:00.504 --> 15:02.339
Well, if you want privacy
let go of the ring.

15:02.373 --> 15:04.173
I'm so glad

15:04.208 --> 15:07.009
we came to
this gentile
strip club!

15:07.043 --> 15:08.244
Howard,

15:08.278 --> 15:09.912
here's more bacon to tuck

15:09.946 --> 15:11.780
into the shiksa's G-string!

15:13.583 --> 15:15.449
I'll call you back.

15:15.484 --> 15:17.485
I think it's lovely
you call your mommy

15:17.519 --> 15:19.320
and let her know you're
going to be late for dinner.

15:19.354 --> 15:20.587
From what I know
about these things,

15:20.622 --> 15:22.455
if a woman doesn't
breast-feed on time,

15:22.490 --> 15:25.325
it's very uncomfortable
for her boobies.

15:25.360 --> 15:28.394
Don't you talk about
my mother's boobies!

15:28.429 --> 15:30.029
If you're offended,
let go of the ring

15:30.063 --> 15:32.565
and go on home to your
mother's boobies.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.133
Excellent,
excellent.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.934
Tire each other out,
the ring will be mine.

15:35.968 --> 15:38.703
Howard, why don't you
go after Raj's mother?

15:38.737 --> 15:42.207
Why don't we go
after <i>your</i> mother?

15:42.241 --> 15:44.175
Go ahead.

15:44.209 --> 15:46.311
I have no illusions
about my mother.

15:46.345 --> 15:48.279
She is a kind, loving,

15:48.313 --> 15:50.281
religiously fanatical
right-wing Texan

15:50.315 --> 15:52.350
with a slightly
out-of-scale head

15:52.384 --> 15:54.686
and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction.

15:55.654 --> 15:58.122
Anything you'd like to add?

15:58.156 --> 16:00.157
That's not gonna
get you anywhere.

16:00.191 --> 16:01.658
Better pull out
the big gun.

16:01.693 --> 16:02.659
You're right.

16:02.694 --> 16:04.895
Let's talk about
your grandmother.

16:04.929 --> 16:06.663
SHELDON: No!

16:06.698 --> 16:09.233
I call no Meemaws.

16:09.267 --> 16:10.701
Think about this.

16:10.735 --> 16:15.205
The only way your mother was
born was your Meemaw had sex.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.140
(chuckling)

16:17.175 --> 16:18.575
I don't want to hear this.

16:18.610 --> 16:22.013
Then let go of the ring
and walk away.

16:22.047 --> 16:23.448
Never.

16:23.482 --> 16:24.615
All right.

16:24.650 --> 16:25.816
I'll bet your Meemaw

16:25.851 --> 16:28.286
didn't just have sex
to have your mother.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.923
I bet she had sex
because she liked it.

16:31.957 --> 16:33.224
(chuckling)

16:33.259 --> 16:34.659
Stop it!

16:34.694 --> 16:36.394
Yeah, Meemaw
did the nasty.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.197
I said stop it!

16:38.231 --> 16:40.032
We're getting to him.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.033
Waterfalls!

16:41.067 --> 16:41.800
What?

16:41.834 --> 16:43.001
Waterfalls.

16:43.036 --> 16:44.002
Crashing waves.

16:44.037 --> 16:45.437
Babbling brooks.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.240
What are you doing?

16:48.274 --> 16:49.474
Subliminal messaging.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.744
I'm going to make you
want to pee.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.547
Dripping faucets.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.582
Leaky gutter.

16:56.617 --> 16:59.419
Peeing.

16:59.453 --> 17:01.154
It's, it's not
working, dude.

17:01.188 --> 17:04.223
Oh-ho-ho,
it's working all right.

17:04.259 --> 17:06.526
I have to pee.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.362
Then let go of
the ring and go.

17:08.396 --> 17:10.830
No, actually,
I wouldn't mind going, too.

17:10.865 --> 17:12.366
(sighing):
Fine.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.733
Um, on the count
of three.

17:13.769 --> 17:15.169
One, two...

17:15.204 --> 17:16.404
Wait, just to clarify.

17:16.438 --> 17:20.473
When you get to three,
do we stand up or do we pee?

17:23.645 --> 17:25.779
We stand up.

17:25.813 --> 17:28.415
Excellent choice.

17:28.449 --> 17:30.583
Three.

17:36.122 --> 17:37.389
Something tells me

17:37.423 --> 17:41.060
this was a bad day
to wear suede shoes.

17:49.337 --> 17:51.438
(sighs)

17:57.012 --> 17:58.980
I've done it!

17:59.015 --> 18:00.882
I've won!

18:00.916 --> 18:03.251
The ring is mine!

18:03.285 --> 18:05.453
It's mine!

18:11.058 --> 18:15.161
We're going to clean it up
and make it pretty.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.663
My own.

18:17.698 --> 18:19.631
My love.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.800
My precious.

18:24.304 --> 18:27.440
(high-pitched scream)

18:30.378 --> 18:32.279
Where's the ring?

18:32.314 --> 18:36.184
It's in a FedEx box on its way
back to where it came from.

18:36.219 --> 18:39.255
The fires of Mount Doom?

18:39.289 --> 18:41.957
Peter Jackson's office
in New Zealand.

18:41.991 --> 18:43.192
It wasn't ours.

18:43.226 --> 18:44.660
You quit the game!

18:44.694 --> 18:46.061
You had no right
to take it.

18:46.095 --> 18:47.663
I came in here, you guys
were all sleeping.

18:47.697 --> 18:49.598
The ring was on the floor.
No one was touching it.

18:49.633 --> 18:52.168
Well, so then we start the game
over until there's a winner.

18:52.203 --> 18:54.537
There wasn't ever going
to be a winner.

18:54.571 --> 18:57.006
There was going to be a selfish,
petty person with a ring

18:57.041 --> 18:58.842
and three people
who used to be his friend.

18:58.876 --> 19:00.143
Is that really
what you guys want?

19:00.177 --> 19:01.410
'Cause if it is, fine.

19:01.445 --> 19:03.813
I don't want anything
to do with you.

19:03.848 --> 19:05.949
And I don't know what happened
in that bathroom,

19:05.984 --> 19:07.584
but I am not cleaning it up!

19:24.403 --> 19:27.706
My precious.

19:45.458 --> 19:47.593
I knew it.

19:50.631 --> 19:51.998
Give us
the precious!

19:52.033 --> 19:53.900
(screams)

19:53.935 --> 19:55.669
Give me! Give me!
Get off of me!

19:55.704 --> 19:57.739
Give me the ring!
It's mine!

19:57.773 --> 20:00.408
Ugh, gotta go back to dating
dumb guys from the gym.

20:00.443 --> 20:01.877
Just give me
the ring!

20:01.911 --> 20:03.011
Give it to me!

20:03.046 --> 20:04.346
Give me the ring!

20:04.381 --> 20:05.481
I said give it to me!

20:05.515 --> 20:07.583
<i>It's mine!</i>
