01:15.300 --> 01:17.400
Doesn't anyone want breakfast?

01:17.400 --> 01:19.968
I have an egg and someM&M's.

01:19.968 --> 01:22.567
I can make an omelet.

01:22.567 --> 01:25.601
No, thanks, Peg.
I'm still pleasantly nauseous

01:25.601 --> 01:29.634
after last night's feast
of the three-legged chicken.

01:29.634 --> 01:32.834
Why would you buy a chicken
with three drumsticks?

01:32.834 --> 01:34.634
Well, it cost
seven cents a pound.

01:34.634 --> 01:37.701
The one with two legs
cost $1.19 a pound.

01:37.701 --> 01:40.834
Excuse me for thinking
of our bank book

01:40.834 --> 01:42.968
instead of our health.

01:42.968 --> 01:45.901
Didn't you think that just maybe
there was something wrong

01:45.901 --> 01:48.200
when the label said
"Chernobyl Farms"?

01:51.701 --> 01:55.367
I mean, how many chickens
have flippers?

01:55.367 --> 01:57.667
Well, don't blame me for that.

01:57.667 --> 02:00.200
I just thought
it was an extra head.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.901
You liked it,
didn't you, Bud?

02:02.901 --> 02:04.501
Well, it was tasty,
but hard to eat.

02:04.501 --> 02:06.300
I mean, every time
I cut a piece off,

02:06.300 --> 02:07.300
it would grow back.

02:07.300 --> 02:09.467
Aw...

02:09.467 --> 02:11.267
Hey, can't somebody get Kelly
out of the bathroom?

02:11.267 --> 02:12.267
I'm a little queasy.

02:12.267 --> 02:13.701
I'm still trying
to pass a beak.

02:15.834 --> 02:17.567
Next.

02:17.567 --> 02:19.601
Ah, there we--
That's me, Dad.

02:19.601 --> 02:22.868
I have to, uh...
stud myself up for school.

02:22.868 --> 02:24.901
Oh, so you'll be needing
your smoking jacket

02:24.901 --> 02:28.400
with matching blue Pampers.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.834
Girls like me.

02:30.834 --> 02:32.534
They do.

02:32.534 --> 02:35.067
So, what's for lunch
today, Mom,

02:35.067 --> 02:37.400
leftover chicken tumor?

02:37.400 --> 02:39.834
You know, I'm hurt.

02:39.834 --> 02:42.434
I feed a family of four
for 32 cents,

02:42.434 --> 02:45.300
and all I get is grief.

02:45.300 --> 02:47.234
You know, I am trying
to save money

02:47.234 --> 02:49.667
for the more important things
for this family.

02:49.667 --> 02:53.868
Can I have $70
to play the lottery?

02:53.868 --> 02:57.367
Can't I just give you 70 cents
for some prime rib?

02:57.367 --> 02:58.634
Oh, please, Al?

02:58.634 --> 03:02.767
The jackpot is up to $6 million,
and I have a system.

03:02.767 --> 03:04.234
I know I can win.

03:04.234 --> 03:05.834
Oh, leave Daddy alone, Mom.

03:05.834 --> 03:08.000
He works hard for his money.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.133
Dad...

03:10.133 --> 03:15.400
could I have $100
for a python?

03:15.400 --> 03:19.133
I need one for
the school talent show.

03:19.133 --> 03:23.601
Marry your own wallet.

03:23.601 --> 03:25.834
Oh, Al, please?

03:25.834 --> 03:28.334
I just need $70
to play my system.

03:28.334 --> 03:29.667
I've studied the numbers.

03:29.667 --> 03:30.767
And you know, in school,

03:30.767 --> 03:32.367
there was one thing
I was good at.

03:32.367 --> 03:33.968
Yeah, but, Peg,
in the real world,

03:33.968 --> 03:35.200
they don't give prizes

03:35.200 --> 03:38.133
for the longest period
by a sophomore.

03:39.701 --> 03:40.734
It's all yours, Dad.

03:40.734 --> 03:42.267
Well, it's about time.

03:42.267 --> 03:45.033
The man who goes to work,
who pays the bills,

03:45.033 --> 03:47.601
finally gets to enjoy
the fruits of his labor.

03:47.601 --> 03:49.367
Stand back, kids,

03:49.367 --> 03:51.701
let Daddy show you
how it's done.

03:51.701 --> 03:54.434
Oh, and you might want
to put on your galoshes.

03:54.434 --> 03:55.868
Aw, no.

03:55.868 --> 04:00.367
Yup. She's rising
like the mighty Mississipp'.

04:00.367 --> 04:01.934
Now, from what I can tell,

04:01.934 --> 04:04.300
either you or Mom must've tried
to flush Kelly's report card

04:04.300 --> 04:05.234
down the toilet.

04:09.701 --> 04:13.367
Oh, no. Did I let
the Fs out of the bag?

04:13.367 --> 04:15.267
Al, she's failing again.

04:15.267 --> 04:16.567
Who cares?

04:16.567 --> 04:19.334
I've got a chicken
pecking its way out of my body.

04:20.901 --> 04:22.901
Why did we buy a house
with only one bathroom?

04:22.901 --> 04:26.467
Because all the houses
in our price range were on fire.

04:26.467 --> 04:29.634
Oh, except for that
lovely house with no kitchen

04:29.634 --> 04:31.901
that I wanted.

04:31.901 --> 04:34.567
Well, Peg, we all have to live
with our disappointments.

04:34.567 --> 04:36.868
I, of course,
have to sleep with mine.

04:43.334 --> 04:45.868
Is that its new name?

04:50.501 --> 04:52.334
[LAUGHS]

04:54.501 --> 04:58.100
But the point is...

04:58.100 --> 05:00.534
when I was growing up,
I had two dreams.

05:00.534 --> 05:01.834
One was being an astronaut

05:01.834 --> 05:05.100
and landing on the planet
Jayne Mansfield.

05:05.100 --> 05:08.000
The other was having a bathroom
all to myself.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.934
Well, Daddy got blown off course

05:09.934 --> 05:13.834
and had to crash
on a much darker planet.

05:13.834 --> 05:16.801
But, family, I'm going
to realize my second dream.

05:16.801 --> 05:18.667
I'm going to build a bathroom,

05:18.667 --> 05:20.000
the greatest bathroom
in the world,

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
and I want you to know
something, all of you:

05:23.100 --> 05:26.067
Nobody uses that bathroom
but me.

05:26.067 --> 05:31.067
Al, honey, how can we afford
a new bathroom?

05:31.067 --> 05:35.200
As it is, we give the kids candy
and tell them it's vitamins.

05:35.200 --> 05:38.467
No more vitamins
for a while, kids.

05:38.467 --> 05:40.534
But don't worry,
it won't cost much

05:40.534 --> 05:42.601
because I'm gonna build it
myself.

05:44.067 --> 05:45.133
Mom, I'm scared.

05:49.367 --> 05:52.133
Hi, honey. How was school?

05:52.133 --> 05:53.667
Oh, reading, adding,

05:53.667 --> 05:55.868
false alarm, Principal's office,
the usual.

05:58.334 --> 06:02.467
Kelly, you believe
in your mother, don't you?

06:02.467 --> 06:04.367
Well, a little bit.

06:05.767 --> 06:07.200
That's sweet.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.100
Now, can I borrow some money
for the lottery?

06:09.100 --> 06:12.868
I can't, Mom. Since Dad decided
to build his dream bathroom,

06:12.868 --> 06:14.801
he took away our allowance.

06:14.801 --> 06:16.067
What, does he think,

06:16.067 --> 06:18.167
blond hair just grows
out of your head?

06:20.701 --> 06:23.934
It's here!

06:23.934 --> 06:25.667
[GRUNTING]

06:25.667 --> 06:28.601
Where's Bud?
I want him to see this.

06:28.601 --> 06:30.067
Bud, get down here!

06:30.067 --> 06:31.868
Family, gather round.

06:31.868 --> 06:34.000
What is it, Dad?

06:36.434 --> 06:39.033
My destiny, son.

06:39.033 --> 06:41.033
When I was a young boy,
I told myself

06:41.033 --> 06:43.934
when I grew up,
I would have one thing:

06:43.934 --> 06:46.801
a toilet bowl like my dad had.

06:46.801 --> 06:51.334
I thought it was
a head like a peanut.

06:51.334 --> 06:53.067
He had one of those too.

06:53.067 --> 06:55.734
You're not gonna
ruin my moment, Peg.

06:55.734 --> 06:59.434
Now, stand back
and feast your eyes on...

06:59.434 --> 07:00.300
this!

07:05.267 --> 07:08.267
Is it just me,
or is that a toilet?

07:08.267 --> 07:10.567
Not just a toilet.

07:10.567 --> 07:14.133
A Ferguson, the king of bowls.

07:16.234 --> 07:17.901
Bud, sit down.

07:17.901 --> 07:20.801
Let me tell you
the story of the Ferguson.

07:23.901 --> 07:26.000
Now, these babies were
made in Maine, you know,

07:26.000 --> 07:27.701
at the little
Ferguson factory.

07:27.701 --> 07:30.634
It's the Stradivarius
of toilets.

07:30.634 --> 07:33.734
And my dad could play it
like a violin.

07:33.734 --> 07:36.901
[BOTH LAUGH]

07:39.567 --> 07:40.901
Yep, I'll never forget the time

07:40.901 --> 07:42.701
my dad took me on a trip
to Maine

07:42.701 --> 07:43.701
to visit the factory.

07:43.701 --> 07:45.100
I had to go to the bathroom,

07:45.100 --> 07:47.300
and I begged him to pull in
to a truck stop.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.901
He said, "No,
wait till we get there.

07:48.901 --> 07:51.167
It'll be worth it."

07:51.167 --> 07:53.267
It was.

07:53.267 --> 07:56.968
Excuse me, here, Dad,
but a toilet is a toilet.

07:59.934 --> 08:03.968
Bud, the toilets today
aren't worthy of the name.

08:03.968 --> 08:07.100
They come in designer colors,
and they're too low.

08:07.100 --> 08:08.567
When you flush 'em,

08:08.567 --> 08:11.300
they make this little, weak,
almost apologetic sound.

08:11.300 --> 08:12.868
Not the Ferguson.

08:12.868 --> 08:14.667
It only comes in white.

08:14.667 --> 08:16.234
And when you flush it,

08:16.234 --> 08:18.534
ba...whoosh!

08:20.601 --> 08:23.434
That's a man's flush, Bud.

08:23.434 --> 08:26.567
A Ferguson says, "I'm a toilet.

08:26.567 --> 08:29.934
Sit down
and give me your best shot."

08:29.934 --> 08:31.601
Oh, if only a Ferguson
could speak,

08:31.601 --> 08:32.601
the tales it would tell...

08:34.400 --> 08:37.133
And now I've got one
of my very own.

08:37.133 --> 08:40.299
Yeah, I just wish
Dad could be alive--

08:47.334 --> 08:49.901
This time, I don't think
he's coming back.

08:59.968 --> 09:03.667
Oh, look, Dad,
I'm sitting on my own Ferguson.

09:03.667 --> 09:07.834
Just like you always knew
I would.

09:10.234 --> 09:13.167
Remember this
at the trial, kids.

09:22.834 --> 09:26.167
A Ferguson, you say.

09:26.167 --> 09:29.634
It's made by elves,
I think,

09:29.634 --> 09:31.767
somewhere in Canada.

09:31.767 --> 09:34.300
How long will it take him
to build the bathroom?

09:34.300 --> 09:35.601
Well, the instruction book says

09:35.601 --> 09:37.901
that a child can do it
in three weeks.

09:37.901 --> 09:41.634
So you figure six, eight months.

09:41.634 --> 09:44.868
Then we'll bring in a child.

09:44.868 --> 09:47.000
Well, on the plus side,
a second bathroom

09:47.000 --> 09:49.501
will increase the value
of the house considerably.

09:49.501 --> 09:51.434
[DRILL WHIRS]

09:55.067 --> 09:56.767
But on the minus side...

09:56.767 --> 09:59.901
doing it himself, is he?

09:59.901 --> 10:02.133
Steve, why don't you go in,
see if you can help?

10:02.133 --> 10:03.434
Why should I help him?

10:03.434 --> 10:06.167
Because if you don't,
he may not finish.

10:06.167 --> 10:09.601
Then he'll come over
and use our bathroom.

10:09.601 --> 10:11.133
Like last week.

10:11.133 --> 10:13.267
He killed our goldfish.

10:33.167 --> 10:34.367
Doh, hi, Al.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.667
Uh, I was just cutting
through here to go home.

10:36.667 --> 10:38.634
No, no. Hang on
a second there, Steve.

10:38.634 --> 10:40.868
I want to
ask you something.

10:40.868 --> 10:42.634
What do you think so far?

10:43.934 --> 10:46.000
It's a dream, Al.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.901
Yeah, many's a time I'll be
sitting in my bathroom,

10:48.901 --> 10:51.033
wishing I could
look at my car.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.334
Do I detect a little
green-eyed monster

10:55.334 --> 10:57.033
sneaking into your voice
there, Steve?

10:57.033 --> 10:58.234
Come on, you can be honest.

10:58.234 --> 10:59.834
It's beautiful, isn't it?

10:59.834 --> 11:03.868
Al, I don't see any area
marked off for a sink.

11:03.868 --> 11:06.968
Hey, this is a man's bathroom.

11:06.968 --> 11:08.434
Ah, you know how

11:08.434 --> 11:10.834
when you have to share
a bathroom with a woman,

11:10.834 --> 11:13.334
well, in my case, Peggy,

11:13.334 --> 11:15.834
you get nylons
on the shower rod,

11:15.834 --> 11:18.934
you get Nair
where the toothpaste should be,

11:18.934 --> 11:22.467
and a bottle of vinegar
lying around.

11:22.467 --> 11:23.934
I mean...

11:23.934 --> 11:28.200
What do they do in there,
make a salad?

11:28.200 --> 11:30.801
Well, not in my bathroom, Steve.

11:30.801 --> 11:32.234
In my medicine cabinet,

11:32.234 --> 11:33.701
I'm just gonna have
guy stuff:

11:33.701 --> 11:35.667
You know, Rolaids,
milk of magnesia,

11:35.667 --> 11:37.501
Tums, my razor.

11:37.501 --> 11:39.901
Why do you need a razor
when you don't have a sink?

11:39.901 --> 11:41.834
Oh, it's not for shaving, Steve,

11:41.834 --> 11:43.133
it's for peace of mind.

11:43.133 --> 11:45.634
Look over here.

11:45.634 --> 11:47.000
This is my own design.

11:47.000 --> 11:52.367
This is my four-roll
toilet paper dispenser.

11:52.367 --> 11:55.167
No more running out
in crucial situations.

11:55.167 --> 11:58.167
When the bomb drops, I'm set.

11:58.167 --> 12:01.667
Now, listen, Al, there might be
some looting out there.

12:01.667 --> 12:04.000
You might wanna get a rifle
to protect those babies.

12:05.601 --> 12:07.634
That's a good thought, Steve.

12:13.267 --> 12:15.033
I had another great thought
the other day.

12:15.033 --> 12:17.033
You know, I've been going
to lots of bathrooms lately,

12:17.033 --> 12:18.334
you know, research.

12:18.334 --> 12:20.300
And I saw something in
a public bathroom downtown

12:20.300 --> 12:22.501
that I thought would work
just great in my bathroom here.

12:22.501 --> 12:25.567
A door high enough so you can
crawl under without paying?

12:25.567 --> 12:27.601
Oh, excuse me, Steve.

12:27.601 --> 12:29.367
See, I don't have the class
like you,

12:29.367 --> 12:32.767
what with a fish floating
belly-up in your bathroom.

12:32.767 --> 12:35.534
That fish was alive
in the morning, Al.

12:37.167 --> 12:40.767
Uh, anyway,
I was in this handicap stall,

12:40.767 --> 12:43.400
and I notice that
they have this great rail.

12:43.400 --> 12:47.467
You know, many's the time
I need a rail to help me get up.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.601
You really don't want
this chicken?

12:49.601 --> 12:51.734
Nah, the kids
hate leftovers.

12:51.734 --> 12:57.167
Oh, don't put it
anywhere near a clock.

12:57.167 --> 12:58.434
Anyway, Marcy,

12:58.434 --> 13:01.000
I just know my lottery numbers
are gonna come up,

13:01.000 --> 13:03.434
and I just need $70 to play.

13:03.434 --> 13:04.934
So, what do you say, Marce?

13:04.934 --> 13:06.667
You lend me the $70,

13:06.667 --> 13:10.300
and if I win, I'll pay you back.

13:10.300 --> 13:13.133
Let me be honest
with you, Peggy.

13:13.133 --> 13:15.300
I once loaned money to a friend,

13:15.300 --> 13:17.300
and that person
never paid me back.

13:17.300 --> 13:18.734
I never said a word about it,

13:18.734 --> 13:20.667
but I harbored
a deep resentment.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.567
And it strained
our relationship,

13:22.567 --> 13:24.567
to the point where
the very sight of that person

13:24.567 --> 13:25.567
made me sick.

13:25.567 --> 13:27.334
You're kidding.

13:27.334 --> 13:29.067
What a lowlife.

13:29.067 --> 13:30.234
Who was it?

13:30.234 --> 13:32.400
It was you, Peggy.

13:33.567 --> 13:34.501
Oh.

13:37.334 --> 13:38.968
How'd you like
to have the rights

13:38.968 --> 13:41.634
to Al's organs
after he dies?

13:41.634 --> 13:43.634
Sound good?

13:43.634 --> 13:45.734
Oh, no, I can't do that.

13:45.734 --> 13:48.767
I hocked those the other day
for a tank of gas,

13:48.767 --> 13:51.567
but, you know, I think
I have a spleen left.

13:51.567 --> 13:54.834
No, but thank you.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.701
We have so many knickknacks
already,

13:56.701 --> 13:59.634
it would just be
one more thing to dust.

13:59.634 --> 14:01.701
Look, Peggy,
if you really need the money,

14:01.701 --> 14:03.033
they're looking
for part-time help

14:03.033 --> 14:04.033
at the supermarket.

14:04.033 --> 14:06.501
You'd do that for me?

14:07.968 --> 14:10.868
Listen, why don't you just
ask Al for the money?

14:10.868 --> 14:12.334
I can't.

14:12.334 --> 14:13.934
Ever since he's been
building that bathroom,

14:13.934 --> 14:16.167
he hides his wallet
in a different place.

14:16.167 --> 14:19.133
Al's bowels are draining
the very lifeblood

14:19.133 --> 14:21.267
out of this family.

14:21.267 --> 14:23.601
You know, all he thinks about
is that bathroom.

14:23.601 --> 14:26.400
He even makes flushing sounds
in his sleep.

14:26.400 --> 14:29.701
Ba-whoosh!

14:29.701 --> 14:32.534
Not that he's given up
his regular sounds.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.400
Well, I guess I'm lucky.

14:37.400 --> 14:42.234
Steve just holds himself
and hums.

14:44.601 --> 14:47.634
What a pig,

14:47.634 --> 14:49.634
but at least he's not
building a monument

14:49.634 --> 14:51.767
to his regularity.

14:51.767 --> 14:53.434
I am telling you, Marcy,

14:53.434 --> 14:56.334
Al loves that toilet bowl
more than he does me.

14:56.334 --> 14:58.367
Oh, Peggy, don't be ridiculous.

15:01.567 --> 15:02.601
Hi, Peg.

15:04.234 --> 15:06.133
Daddy loves you.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.934
What does that toilet have
that I don't?

15:10.934 --> 15:12.601
A job.

Mom, when is Dad gonna

15:48.667 --> 15:50.467
I wanna play
some records.

Well, I think you're old enough
to know the truth.

16:24.434 --> 16:26.000
Yes, it is.

16:30.567 --> 16:34.567
Okay, kids, coats off.

16:46.734 --> 16:48.133
What say I get the camera,

16:48.133 --> 16:50.968
and we each pose
for a picture with the bowl?

16:50.968 --> 16:55.634
Oh, can I stick
my head in it, please?

16:55.634 --> 17:00.000

out of a picture, young lady.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.100

Al, we are living like Okies.

17:03.934 --> 17:06.434
Can you please finish
that bathroom?

17:06.434 --> 17:08.166
Peg, I'm in
the home stretch now.

17:08.166 --> 17:09.666
I would've been done already,

17:09.666 --> 17:11.467
but something keeps happening
to my stuff.

17:11.467 --> 17:13.901
Bud, did you take
my adjustable wrenches?

17:15.099 --> 17:16.767
Yeah, Dad.

17:16.767 --> 17:18.367
You're onto me.

17:18.367 --> 17:20.800
I've been having
these wild parties.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.634
I've been inviting girls over,

17:22.634 --> 17:24.300
and we turn the lights down
real low,

17:24.300 --> 17:27.334
and we...gang-fix the sink.

17:29.634 --> 17:30.601
Kelly?

17:31.801 --> 17:33.501
Oh, come on, Dad, look around.

17:33.501 --> 17:35.000
If I was gonna steal anything,

17:35.000 --> 17:36.734
it certainly wouldn't be
from this house.

17:36.734 --> 17:38.667
Yeah, it must be the neighbors.

17:38.667 --> 17:40.567
You know,
people hear you got a Ferguson,

17:40.567 --> 17:42.067
they think you got money.

17:42.067 --> 17:44.234
Yeah, well, people hear
you got a husband,

17:44.234 --> 17:46.868
they think you have sex.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.667
Say what you will, Peg,
you won't bring me down.

17:50.667 --> 17:53.834
This bowl has given me
a natural high.

17:53.834 --> 17:56.968
Button up, kids.
I'm going back to work.

17:56.968 --> 17:58.367

18:39.167 --> 18:42.601
Oh, Al, I'm sorry,

18:42.601 --> 18:45.200
but it's just that you've
been hiding your wallet.

18:45.200 --> 18:48.167
And I had to sell your tools
for lottery money.

18:51.033 --> 18:54.067
Oh, Al, you see, if you die,

18:54.067 --> 18:55.534
then I can get welfare.

18:55.534 --> 18:58.968
But if you live,
I have nothing.

18:58.968 --> 19:01.601
I had to do it.
Don't you understand?

19:01.601 --> 19:03.567
You see, you've got
this bathroom.

19:03.567 --> 19:05.601
Well, this lottery
is my bathroom.

19:05.601 --> 19:07.868

19:07.868 --> 19:10.434
Yours is just pathetic.

19:10.434 --> 19:13.400
Well, okay, Peg, if you think
that winning the lottery

19:13.400 --> 19:14.901
is more important
than our marriage,

19:14.901 --> 19:16.767

the lottery.

you to do is nothing.

better than you.

the kids are hungry

19:51.133 --> 19:52.367

on the couch

19:54.200 --> 19:55.434

you don't exist?

19:55.434 --> 19:56.501
Yes.

you broke your foot?

Yes!

20:00.767 --> 20:02.934

for me, please?

one other thing.

for the lottery,

the other day, and...

20:25.434 --> 20:28.767
I was rubbing my eyes.
