You know, there is a word

13:14.315 --> 13:17.517
when you lean on something,
a crutch.

13:21.456 --> 13:22.856
or whatever with
a "Higher Power",

13:22.957 --> 13:24.758
it's just swapping one crutch
for another.

13:24.859 --> 13:27.527
That is a bummer way
of looking at things.

13:27.629 --> 13:29.897
Why don't you just tell
these people the truth?

13:29.998 --> 13:33.567
Maybe we just need to accept
the world for what actually is.

13:33.668 --> 13:38.038
Oh, what about making
the world what we want it to be?

You know, with a little effort,
a little faith.

- Some dick.

13:47.282 --> 13:49.850
Wow!

13:49.951 --> 13:51.852
So, what do you believe in?

13:51.953 --> 13:54.154
It doesn't have to be God
or whatever,

13:54.255 --> 13:56.890
but something bigger than you.

14:03.031 --> 14:04.598
I don't understand.

14:04.699 --> 14:06.433
The idea is you look
at the list of ingredients

14:06.534 --> 14:08.174
and try to figure out
what the spell does.

14:08.269 --> 14:10.804
- Yeah.
- Maybe, we should move on,

14:10.905 --> 14:12.873

14:26.754 --> 14:28.455

24:39.293 --> 24:40.360

any better?

You heard of it?

25:56.704 --> 26:00.039
Yeah. Well...
I sort of checked myself

26:00.141 --> 26:02.876
in here to get away
from magic, so...

26:02.977 --> 26:05.945
Look, you think magic
is some terrible vice,

26:06.046 --> 26:09.549
so bad that you need
rehab to get clean, it's not.

26:09.650 --> 26:12.352
Magic isn't heroin, Julia.

26:12.453 --> 26:13.653
It's a gift.

26:13.754 --> 26:16.055
Oh, God, please.
Don't say from God.

26:19.059 --> 26:21.060
Then what are you, Richard?

26:22.997 --> 26:26.666
Okay, what we call magic is,

26:26.767 --> 26:28.735
a set of tools.

26:28.836 --> 26:30.670

This is not what I pictured.

It's from the fourth

29:01.255 --> 29:03.423
I read them all for research.

29:03.524 --> 29:07.293
Yeah, Jane, she was alone
in Fillory for the first time

29:07.394 --> 29:09.429
when she was attacked
by a Lorian assassin.

29:09.530 --> 29:11.090
- What's Lorian?
- They're the bad guys.

29:11.165 --> 29:12.405
Uh, from a neighboring kingdom.

29:12.433 --> 29:13.766
It's actually
really interesting,

29:13.867 --> 29:16.302
because Fillory is both,
the name of the landmass

29:16.403 --> 29:17.637
and also the one
of the sovereign states--

29:17.738 --> 29:20.506
Quentin, focus, please.

29:20.607 --> 29:21.641
Ah, yeah.

29:21.742 --> 29:26.079
Ah, um, so the Lorian
stabbed Jane

29:26.180 --> 29:27.660
with something
called the Virgo Blade.

29:27.748 --> 29:30.683

from the wounds--

the way grosser,

29:36.090 --> 29:38.358
Um, this guy, Honeyclaw,
he was taking care of Jane.

29:38.459 --> 29:39.726
Honeyclaw?

29:39.827 --> 29:42.161
- Yeah. A-a talking bear.
- Oh, Jesus.

29:42.262 --> 29:44.702
Honeyclaw said that the vines
would keep growing and growing

29:44.732 --> 29:50.036
until they strangled her heart,
um, but Jane survived.

29:50.137 --> 29:51.604
Penny, I know how to fix this.

29:55.677 --> 29:56.863
Is that a turban?

29:57.198 --> 29:58.757
No, it's your hair.

29:59.881 --> 30:01.584
Sewing is not really my thing.

30:02.403 --> 30:04.471
How is a voodoo doll
is supposed to help me?

30:04.572 --> 30:06.339
Um, so, in the books,

30:06.440 --> 30:08.942
Jane carried this doll with her
everywhere she goes,

30:09.043 --> 30:10.944
and it looks just like her.

30:11.045 --> 30:14.380
And so they realized
that the curse

30:14.482 --> 30:17.684
of the Virgo Blade would accept
the doll as a substitute.

30:19.153 --> 30:21.955

Jane's doll wasn't special
because it looked like Jane.

32:33.387 --> 32:36.322

of where it came from.

32:39.426 --> 32:41.427

<i>It was all she took with her

<i>What we love can be as

35:49.365 --> 35:51.900
It's predictable I know.

35:52.001 --> 35:53.702
Predictable's not bad, Quentin.

36:01.010 --> 36:02.678
Hey.

36:02.779 --> 36:05.180
What about this?

36:05.281 --> 36:07.082
A candy bar wrapper?

36:07.183 --> 36:08.343
It's from Brakebills South.

36:08.418 --> 36:10.319
This is the last place
that he saw Kady.

36:10.420 --> 36:13.522
Quentin, I don't think Penny
even cares that she's gone.

36:13.623 --> 36:16.124
Believe me.

36:16.226 --> 36:17.593
He does.

What was that?
That you gave me?

36:49.792 --> 36:51.260
Did it work?

36:51.361 --> 36:53.328
It didn't feel like
I was doing a casting,

36:53.429 --> 36:56.331
it felt like a casting
was being done on me.

36:56.432 --> 36:58.834
It's because it's not a spell,
it was a prayer.

36:58.935 --> 37:01.870
- To what?
- Local harvest deity.

37:01.971 --> 37:03.639
Friendly,
but a little one-trick.

37:03.740 --> 37:05.807
You're lucky she answered.
She's pretty shy.

37:05.909 --> 37:08.710
It's like touching a bare wire.

37:08.811 --> 37:11.079
More energy than I've felt.

37:11.180 --> 37:12.247
It felt good.

37:12.348 --> 37:14.917
It felt...dangerous.

37:17.921 --> 37:20.923
The reason you treat magic
like a drug,

37:21.024 --> 37:22.758
is because the people
that taught it to you

37:22.859 --> 37:24.259
act like drug dealers.

37:24.360 --> 37:25.994
They buy it and they sell it,

37:26.095 --> 37:28.964
and they fight
and they fuck for it.

37:29.065 --> 37:32.234
Well, that's not
the only way to live.

37:32.335 --> 37:34.903
That's the only way
I've ever seen.

37:35.004 --> 37:38.607
I'm a very good Magician

37:38.708 --> 37:41.143
and I do this.

37:41.244 --> 37:43.312
There are good people
out there, Julia.

37:43.413 --> 37:44.947
People trying to learn
about the world

37:45.048 --> 37:46.715
and make it a better place.

37:46.816 --> 37:48.684
Now, you can be
one of those people,

37:48.785 --> 37:51.186
you can be a dealer,

37:51.287 --> 37:54.456
you can stay here
and be nothing.

37:56.559 --> 37:58.794
You get to choose.

38:07.170 --> 38:10.439
If I give you something,

38:10.540 --> 38:13.008
you think you can get it
into Brakebills for me?

38:16.145 --> 38:18.213
Don't bother
with the performance.

38:18.314 --> 38:21.216
Even with these wards,
I can see right through you.

38:21.317 --> 38:23.585
I wouldn't dream of fooling you.

38:23.686 --> 38:26.054
I have far bigger dreams
than that.

38:26.155 --> 38:28.457
Very clever,
targeting someone else

38:28.558 --> 38:30.058
outside the campus protections.

38:30.159 --> 38:32.561
Graduate with an alumni key.

38:32.662 --> 38:36.264

38:36.366 --> 38:37.366

38:37.467 --> 38:38.734
There won't be a next time.

38:38.835 --> 38:40.469
You can't hide
in Fillory forever.

38:40.570 --> 38:42.204
Lock as many doors as you want,

38:42.305 --> 38:44.406
there's always a door to Fillory
when you need one.

38:44.507 --> 38:46.108
Nothing's changed.

38:46.209 --> 38:50.145
Still the same determined
little Jane Chatwin.

38:50.246 --> 38:52.481
No, I never wanted this.

38:52.582 --> 38:55.984
You forced my hand.
I wish I could be any other way.

38:56.085 --> 38:59.821
I picked the Virgo Blade,
specially for you, Jane.

38:59.922 --> 39:01.790
Little twinge of nostalgia.

39:01.891 --> 39:05.260
Penny's going to live
and this meat puppet of yours

39:05.361 --> 39:07.696
is going to a Salvadorian prison
in the morning.

39:07.797 --> 39:09.598
All that scheming, wasted.

39:09.699 --> 39:12.034
I could walk out of here
anytime I like.

39:12.135 --> 39:15.437
If you can leave anytime,
what are you waiting for?

39:15.538 --> 39:18.507
Oh, I was waiting...
