<i>Can't get over this heat.</i>

00:19.949 --> 00:22.685
<i>Swear to God, they put
your office on top of hell.</i>

00:22.686 --> 00:24.254
I know you have to get going.

00:24.255 --> 00:27.191
I do. Senator Doyle's
kind of a stikler.

00:27.192 --> 00:30.295
Yeah. Yeah, he seems like
a massive stickler.

00:30.296 --> 00:34.265
Well, like I was saying, the senator has
a lot of time for filibuster reform.

00:34.266 --> 00:36.586
Bottom line here, Eric, we
need him to sponsor this bill.

00:36.587 --> 00:37.702
( Sneezes )

00:37.703 --> 00:39.937
- ( Phone vibrates )
- Excuse me.

00:39.938 --> 00:41.606
God, this gastric bug,

00:41.607 --> 00:43.474
it's got my head all jammed up

00:43.475 --> 00:45.576
and my ass is like
the thunderdome.

00:45.577 --> 00:47.378
Yeah!
Boom, come to mama!

00:47.379 --> 00:50.583
Sorry, not you.
This. Excuse me.

00:50.584 --> 00:54.788
Oh, my God, this heat
is just unbearable.

00:54.789 --> 00:56.325
I feel like a gecko.

00:56.326 --> 00:59.329
Sorry to interrupt, but
fuck-a-deedoo-dah, fuck-a-Dee-ay!

00:59.330 --> 01:01.165
- Martin at the White House.
- What?

01:01.166 --> 01:04.203
"Clean jobs task force likely to
be green lit!" Exclamation point.

01:04.203 --> 01:07.307
Yeah!
Oh, my God!

01:07.308 --> 01:09.210
That is so great for me.

01:09.211 --> 01:11.679
- And the country.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I meant.

01:11.680 --> 01:13.917
Oh, Amy.
Good job, Amy.

01:13.918 --> 01:16.519
- Good job.
- That's why I get paid the medium bucks.

01:16.520 --> 01:19.323
<i>- This is legacy stuff.
- Yeah, it is.</i>

01:19.324 --> 01:22.294
Polluting corporations
held accountable by me.

01:22.295 --> 01:25.197
Dependence on foreign oil
ended by me.

01:25.198 --> 01:27.166
- Could you stop that?
- Really close.

01:27.167 --> 01:28.869
I'm gonna get Sue to call
Mart at the White House.

01:28.870 --> 01:32.240
I still need to say goodbye to
senator Doyle's chief of staff.

01:32.241 --> 01:33.709
Oh, is he still here?

01:33.710 --> 01:36.178
You know what I'm gonna do?
Brush past.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.381
Give him a smile
to take back to his boss.

01:38.382 --> 01:40.617
- Okay.
- Which way are you going?

01:40.618 --> 01:42.286
- Elevator bank, first door.
- Okay. Yeah.

01:42.287 --> 01:44.455
<i>Eric, apologies.</i>

01:44.456 --> 01:45.990
Oh, Sue,
did the President call?

01:45.991 --> 01:47.325
- No.
- No? Okay.

01:47.326 --> 01:49.461
- Everything okay?
- Oh, yeah, things are great.

01:49.462 --> 01:50.862
- Good.
- Things are great.

01:50.863 --> 01:54.600
<i>So, yeah, the Vice President
will see you this afternoon.</i>

01:54.601 --> 01:57.503
<i>We'll see the senator
and yourself.</i>

01:57.504 --> 02:00.573
Um, this is an interesting
piece of paper.

02:00.574 --> 02:03.409
Oh, madam Vice President,
you remember Eric.

02:03.410 --> 02:05.778
- Oh, of course. Eric.
- Madam Vice President.

02:05.779 --> 02:07.947
- How are you?
- I've got a little bit of the bug,

02:07.948 --> 02:10.083
but other than that, I'm good.

02:10.084 --> 02:12.185
I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, drink plenty of liquid.

02:12.186 --> 02:14.555
Well, that's sort of a stupid
thing to say, isn't it?

02:14.556 --> 02:16.891
'Cause you can't drink
a solid, can you?

02:16.892 --> 02:19.094
Soup?

02:19.095 --> 02:21.930
Well, soup is solids suspended in
liquid, so it qualifies as a liquid.

02:21.931 --> 02:25.868
See that? Gary was a major at U.V.A.
in science.

02:25.869 --> 02:29.171
So occasionally that's of use.

02:30.474 --> 02:31.974
<i>So we'll see you
guys this afternoon.</i>

02:31.975 --> 02:34.544
- Great. Nice to see you.
- So nice to see you.

02:34.545 --> 02:37.714
Take care.
Soup?

02:37.715 --> 02:39.849
Press release
for Selina approval.

02:39.850 --> 02:41.718
- Hey, Mike, your perspiration...
- I know.

02:41.719 --> 02:43.486
- I'm just saying.
- Can't help it. Sign of a healthy body.

02:43.487 --> 02:45.422
<i>- There are products available, Mike.
- I tried them all.</i>

02:45.423 --> 02:48.525
Sweat right through 'em.
I got very large pores.

02:48.526 --> 02:50.995
Hey, guys, quick
sidebar meeting, okay?

02:50.996 --> 02:54.766
<i>- Yeah, yeah.
- Senator Lowden's guy canceled.</i>

02:54.767 --> 02:56.834
He has the gastric flu, too.

02:56.835 --> 03:00.606
His Facebook status is "may
God have mercy on my boxers."

03:00.607 --> 03:02.540
Yeah, I saw that.
I liked it.

03:02.541 --> 03:05.978
Hey, Dan, can you get some
more oxygen in here, please?

03:05.979 --> 03:07.284
Yeah.

03:07.285 --> 03:09.582
This thing is completely useless,
by the way.

03:09.583 --> 03:11.684
Can move more air by farting.

03:11.685 --> 03:13.820
( Laughs )
I'm sure you can, ma'am.

03:13.821 --> 03:16.423
Those don't open.
Those are anti-suicide windows.

03:16.424 --> 03:19.727
They only put those in after you
started working here, right, Gary?

03:19.728 --> 03:21.796
So, here's the deal.

03:21.797 --> 03:24.766
Clean jobs in the bag.
So that's good.

03:24.767 --> 03:28.469
But we've got filibuster reform talks this
afternoon that we've got to deal with.

03:28.470 --> 03:30.704
So let's nail this,
okay, everybody?

03:30.705 --> 03:33.840
- Let's seize the agenda.
- You're making it sound like a coup.

03:33.841 --> 03:37.009
I'm not gonna say I'm not enjoying
the President being in South Africa.

03:37.010 --> 03:41.012
God, wearing some kind of
shawl at a lion sanctuary.

03:41.013 --> 03:43.348
Did you see that photo?
It's unbelievable.

03:43.349 --> 03:46.651
Anyway, I'm just talking
about redefining...

03:46.652 --> 03:49.421
Dan, what was that phrase
that you used in our meeting?

03:49.422 --> 03:51.524
<i>- What was that?
- "Two point me."</i>

03:51.525 --> 03:54.160
"Two point me." That's exactly right.
I love that.

03:54.161 --> 03:56.897
Ma'am, your two-hour with
Glen Yates just canceled.

03:56.898 --> 03:58.265
He's got the bug.

03:58.266 --> 04:01.035
All right, well, that means
I've got two hours free.

04:01.036 --> 04:03.170
Let's capitalize on this,
you guys.

04:03.171 --> 04:05.540
C'mon, let's go somewhere.
Let's meet the public.

04:05.541 --> 04:07.275
- You want to normalize it?
- Yes, exactly.

04:07.276 --> 04:10.011
I want to meet some regular normals.
Where we gonna find them?

04:10.012 --> 04:12.314
Photo op with the normals
and the normalistas.

04:12.315 --> 04:14.216
- There's a book fair...
- Oh, my God.

04:14.217 --> 04:15.717
- ...in Adams Morgan.
- Too dull, no.

04:15.718 --> 04:17.519
You're not gonna get
a good photo holding a book.

04:17.519 --> 04:20.255
- You need something active.
- It's like kids read or something.

04:20.255 --> 04:22.458
Kids are unpredictable.
They wet their pants.

04:22.459 --> 04:24.493
- Keep it simple. Keep it simple.
- Yeah, not good.

04:24.494 --> 04:27.629
Ma'am, frozen yoghurt, all right,
is huge in this town right now.

04:27.630 --> 04:29.465
It's hot out.
Let's go to a store.

04:29.466 --> 04:32.469
There's one that I know that I
go to all the time on U Street.

04:32.470 --> 04:34.538
It's owned by three generations
of African-Americans.

04:34.539 --> 04:36.421
I mean there's a narrative built
right in.

04:36.422 --> 04:38.242
Excellent.
Perfect. Done deal.

04:38.243 --> 04:39.911
We can totally normalize
with those guys.

04:39.912 --> 04:42.480
<i>That's what we're gonna do.
Make it happen, guys.</i>

04:42.481 --> 04:44.816
<i>All right, we're
going to a yoghurt shop.</i>

04:44.817 --> 04:47.085
When was this "two point me"
meeting with Selina?

04:47.086 --> 04:49.120
Oh, are you still
tracking my every move?

04:49.121 --> 04:51.155
I thought we agreed to move on.

04:51.156 --> 04:52.890
Move on from what?
We dated for like a week.

04:52.891 --> 04:54.958
It was like getting
of a mild food poisoning.

04:54.959 --> 04:57.493
Look, Amy, I am genuinely
sorry that my arrival here

04:57.494 --> 05:01.029
has caused you to become so
self-conscious and gain a little weight.

05:01.030 --> 05:03.031
Fuck point you.

05:04.033 --> 05:05.867
- Are we early?
- Yeah.

05:05.868 --> 05:07.335
I want to get there early.

05:07.336 --> 05:09.671
I want the people who are on
time to think that they're late.

05:09.672 --> 05:11.273
- Oh, mind games. Love it.
- Yeah.

05:11.274 --> 05:13.108
I didn't appreciate the reference

05:13.109 --> 05:15.110
to my potential suicide earlier.
I'm not a joke.

05:15.111 --> 05:17.032
No, you're the guy
with the big bag of lip balm, Gary.

05:17.033 --> 05:18.281
You're fucking kissinger.

05:18.282 --> 05:20.615
Every single thing you
say to me is emasculating.

05:20.616 --> 05:22.517
- Do you realize that?
- Yes.

05:22.518 --> 05:26.187
I think that senator Doyle still might
go cold on sponsoring this bill.

05:26.188 --> 05:29.157
Well, 've got to warm him up,
'cause we need his support on

05:29.158 --> 05:32.026
"junk the jams" or whatever
they're calling it now.

05:32.027 --> 05:34.962
- "Unclog the backlog."
- "Unclog the backlog"?

05:34.963 --> 05:37.298
I do a serious job.

05:37.299 --> 05:40.267
I'm next to the veep more
than any other human being.

05:40.268 --> 05:42.469
You are distantly orbiting her.

05:42.470 --> 05:44.971
I'm her moon.

05:44.972 --> 05:48.041
So would you take a bullet
for the veep, Gary?

05:48.042 --> 05:49.843
- Oh, my God.
- No, no, no.

05:49.844 --> 05:52.446
Because, you know, you're gonna
be right in the line of fire.

05:54.149 --> 05:56.784
It's not my job.
I would help her if she was down.

05:56.785 --> 05:58.853
Right, with the lip balm
if she got shot in the lips.

05:58.854 --> 06:00.188
That could crack 'em pretty bad.

06:00.189 --> 06:02.724
Great, we missed the elevators.

06:04.260 --> 06:07.996
Doyle is essential. He's like
the Russian doll of the Senate.

06:07.997 --> 06:10.365
Comes with little senators
inside of him.

06:10.366 --> 06:12.167
Hey, Gary, can I have
a kleenex?

06:12.168 --> 06:14.435
- Where are my people?
- Oh, here they go.

06:14.436 --> 06:15.797
Come on.

06:15.798 --> 06:17.071
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
Please don't shoot.

06:17.072 --> 06:19.640
Shoot him.
You can shoot him.

06:19.641 --> 06:21.909
Where the hell did you go?

06:21.910 --> 06:24.244
- Dan, you're gonna have to go in the limo.
- Oh, sure, yeah.

06:24.245 --> 06:26.404
Ma'am, I think we should start
ramping up the whole launch

06:26.405 --> 06:27.663
of "two point you" right now.

06:27.664 --> 06:29.350
You know, just kind of
a little hint out there

06:29.351 --> 06:30.851
about what clean jobs
is gonna be.

06:30.852 --> 06:33.087
- Yeah, I think the same thing.
- I can get right on this.

06:33.088 --> 06:35.290
Leon West has given me
his private cell.

06:35.291 --> 06:37.459
Oh, good. All right,
let's set up 10 minutes

06:37.460 --> 06:39.526
of face time with him
after the Doyle meeting.

06:39.527 --> 06:40.228
Copy that, I'm on it.

06:40.229 --> 06:43.165
( Sirens blaring )

06:49.472 --> 06:51.506
You know what?
I'm nervous about Doyle.

06:51.507 --> 06:53.742
- He can be a real hogfucker.
- He's a stickler.

06:53.743 --> 06:55.644
Wait a minute.
Hand sanitizer, ma'am.

06:55.645 --> 06:58.114
You know what I heard?
Senator Doyle wears pantyhouse.

06:58.115 --> 06:59.682
- ( Amy laughs )
- Oh, really?

06:59.683 --> 07:02.919
No. But now that you have that
image, he's not that scary.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.720
Oh, listen, tell Dan

07:04.721 --> 07:07.356
to start working on
the yoghurt store, okay?

07:07.357 --> 07:09.091
Wait a minute, Gary.

07:09.092 --> 07:10.693
Gary, this is way too much.

07:10.694 --> 07:13.262
What do you want me to do? What?

07:16.199 --> 07:18.500
Okay, let's not do
that again, all right?

07:18.501 --> 07:20.769
- ( Eric coughing )
- Andrew, how are you?

07:20.770 --> 07:22.036
Madam Vice President,
a pleasure.

07:22.037 --> 07:23.771
Oh, come on.
Selina, please.

07:23.772 --> 07:26.374
Well, let's play this one
by the book.

07:26.375 --> 07:29.411
- Eric, of course.
- We just saw him this morning.

07:29.412 --> 07:31.381
Yeah, you spoke about soup.

07:31.382 --> 07:33.950
( Coughs )

07:33.951 --> 07:36.920
So... should we get to it?

07:36.921 --> 07:39.189
- Let's get to it.
- Let's... okay.

07:39.190 --> 07:41.859
- I'm gonna lighten this up a little bit.
- Please. Please do.

07:41.860 --> 07:44.128
Hi, everybody.

07:47.165 --> 07:50.567
Well, we have
lots to talk about.

07:50.568 --> 07:53.003
Yup, let's do some talking.

07:53.004 --> 07:55.905
- You need me to sponsor this bill.
- Yes, I do.

07:55.906 --> 07:58.907
I do need you to do that.
And I want to know what you need from me.

07:58.908 --> 08:02.444
What do you need?
You need some non-earmark earmarks?

08:02.445 --> 08:05.013
<i>You need support during
your reelection campaign?</i>

08:05.014 --> 08:07.816
I just won't be photographed
eating a hot dog

08:07.817 --> 08:09.284
or any other phallic food.

08:09.285 --> 08:12.553
Oops. ( Laughs )
That was mistake.

08:12.554 --> 08:14.422
<i>- Really don't need any of that, ma'am.
- Okay.</i>

08:14.423 --> 08:16.424
What I need is very simple.

08:16.425 --> 08:18.392
- Actually, what I would like...
- ( Selina screams )

08:18.393 --> 08:20.260
What the hell, Eric?

08:20.261 --> 08:21.895
What was that?
What just happened?

08:21.896 --> 08:23.430
He was gonna seze
on you and I blocked it.

08:23.431 --> 08:24.932
I am so sorry,
madam Vice President.

08:24.933 --> 08:27.535
That is nice work, Eric.
I mean, you want to take another shot?

08:27.536 --> 08:29.837
I don'think we're drenched
at this end of the table.

08:29.838 --> 08:32.339
- Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
- That scared me to death.

08:32.340 --> 08:34.942
He can be a gold-plated
fucking shit gibbing.

08:34.943 --> 08:37.578
- He works for you.
- I mean, he almost sneezed in your face.

08:37.578 --> 08:39.914
I think it's treason.
Let me get you a cup of coffee.

08:39.914 --> 08:41.916
I would love a cup of coffee.

08:41.917 --> 08:43.851
Oh, my goodness.

08:43.852 --> 08:46.021
Listen, I've got
this covered now.

08:46.022 --> 08:48.323
Okay? Why don't you go
round up a few more senators?

08:48.324 --> 08:51.226
- Okay, you sure?
- Mm-hmm, filibuster smackdown.

08:51.227 --> 08:53.396
- That's what I call it.
- All right, dig it.

08:53.397 --> 08:56.466
Oh, wow, I'm shaking from that.
Are you guys?

08:56.467 --> 09:01.371
No, we perfectly understand
senator Murray's reservations.

09:01.372 --> 09:05.275
Yeah, of course, she must
be guided by her conscience.

09:05.276 --> 09:06.810
No hard feelings whatsoever.

09:06.811 --> 09:09.012
<i>- Uh, Dan?
- Yeah?</i>

09:09.013 --> 09:11.003
<i>I hope you don't take
this the wrong way,</i>

09:11.004 --> 09:13.977
but can I just say? You kinda
look like an asshole.

09:13.978 --> 09:18.753
Hello. Did you tell them, Amy?
Oh, come on. Come on.

09:18.754 --> 09:21.656
- I took a bullet for the veep.
- How'd you take a bullet, Gary?

09:21.657 --> 09:24.025
It was a sneeze bullet.
Right in the face.

09:24.026 --> 09:26.561
Saved Selina from the bug.
Pure instinct.

09:26.562 --> 09:29.197
It was like a dirty bomb
and I... bam...

09:29.198 --> 09:31.199
Dived on it.
Mmm!

09:31.200 --> 09:33.034
Hey, hey, it's the flunkies.

09:33.035 --> 09:34.769
And people say
you're bad at your jobs.

09:34.770 --> 09:36.872
- You here to spy, Jonah?
- I'm not here to spy.

09:36.873 --> 09:39.432
I work at the White House,
so I can just walk in and say,

09:39.433 --> 09:41.434
"I'm from the White House.
What the fuck are you doing?"

09:41.435 --> 09:43.379
What?
You work at the White House?

09:43.380 --> 09:46.482
- Oh, my God. Can I blow you?
- Uh, yes, you can.

09:46.483 --> 09:48.818
<i>I will meet you out in the hallway
in a few seconds.</i>

09:48.819 --> 09:50.066
Sure, I'll get a stepladder.

09:50.067 --> 09:52.278
Anyway, I work for the White House.
What the fuck are you doing?

09:52.279 --> 09:55.681
Trying to figure out what flavor
frozen yoghurt the veep should get.

09:59.661 --> 10:01.795
Mint.

10:01.796 --> 10:05.832
It implies freshness,
trust, traditional values.

10:05.833 --> 10:08.336
- Fascinating.
- This is one of my areas.

10:08.337 --> 10:09.904
Yeah, food choices.
Seriously, put it up.

10:09.905 --> 10:12.975
Oh, swirl. Racial harmony
and crossing the aisle.

10:12.976 --> 10:14.910
- ( Phone ngs )
- So is cookies and cream.

10:14.911 --> 10:17.046
White House.
This is Jonah.

10:17.047 --> 10:18.747
Okay.
Watch your head.

10:18.748 --> 10:21.651
Oh, fuck you.
No, not you, sir.

10:21.652 --> 10:25.488
Very excited about this
filibuster reform bill.

10:25.489 --> 10:27.156
That is great to hear.

10:27.157 --> 10:29.558
If you can get
a Senate reform bill

10:29.559 --> 10:31.727
through the place
it's designed to reform,

10:31.728 --> 10:33.595
- that would be amazing.
- Yeah.

10:33.596 --> 10:36.431
I mean, that would be like

10:36.432 --> 10:38.967
persuading a guy to fist himself.

10:38.968 --> 10:41.035
( Chuckles )
Jesus Christ.

10:41.036 --> 10:44.372
( Laughs )
Tell me, Mr. Flatterbox,

10:44.373 --> 10:45.973
what do you need
from me, really?

10:45.974 --> 10:48.175
Well, I need you
to keep oil guys

10:48.176 --> 10:51.379
off the clean jobs task force.

10:51.380 --> 10:54.949
- Don't do this to me, Andrew.
- I'm going to do it to you, yup.

10:54.950 --> 10:56.952
This is a nuanced area.

10:56.953 --> 10:58.820
You are not
in the pocket of oil?

10:58.821 --> 11:01.123
No, I'm not in
the pocket of oil. No.

11:01.124 --> 11:02.759
So we can make this work.

11:02.760 --> 11:05.161
- I'm eager to be constructive.
- Right.

11:05.162 --> 11:08.664
It seems to me that somehow we can make
this happen, then I'd...

11:08.665 --> 11:11.533
Deal. You keep oil guys
off clean jobs,

11:11.534 --> 11:13.435
I will sponsor
the filibuster bill.

11:13.436 --> 11:15.737
Well, we can work...

11:15.738 --> 11:17.439
This out.

11:17.440 --> 11:19.641
- Great. Terrific.
- Wonderful.

11:19.642 --> 11:21.443
- Coffee.
- Hmm?

11:21.444 --> 11:25.046
- Cup?
- Oh, uh-huh. Sure.

11:25.047 --> 11:28.049
Gary, senator Doyle's guy
looks like he's dying.

11:28.050 --> 11:30.551
If I were you, I would go straight to the
pharmacy and take one of everything.

11:30.552 --> 11:33.048
I'm gonna have a blowout
if I walk to the pharmacy.

11:33.049 --> 11:34.065
That's what I'm worried about.

11:34.066 --> 11:35.489
<i>If you're gonna shit your pants,
I don't want you here.</i>

11:35.490 --> 11:37.725
<i>- Hey.
- I think I did the right thing,</i>

11:37.726 --> 11:40.995
but I just need you to confirm
that I did the right thing.

11:40.996 --> 11:42.663
I said something to someone.

11:42.664 --> 11:45.700
What exactly did you say,
ma'am, and to who?

11:45.701 --> 11:47.302
To whom.

11:47.303 --> 11:49.838
Senator Doyle said that
he would sponsor the bill...

11:49.839 --> 11:51.407
<i>Oh!</i>

11:51.408 --> 11:54.110
If we keep oil off
of clean jobs.

11:54.111 --> 11:57.180
And there was
an implication, perhaps...

11:57.181 --> 11:59.015
( Stammers )

11:59.016 --> 12:01.652
- You didn't say yes?
- No.

12:01.653 --> 12:03.821
<i>I didn't say "yes".</i>

12:03.822 --> 12:06.056
I said "yeah".

12:06.057 --> 12:09.126
Okay, well, we told oil we'd put
one of their guys on clean jobs.

12:09.127 --> 12:10.740
That's why we got away
with the cutlery tweet.

12:10.741 --> 12:11.294
I know, I know.

12:11.295 --> 12:13.896
<i>- She's aware of that.
- Okay, I was charmed by Doyle.</i>

12:13.897 --> 12:15.565
He's got that little
twinkle in his eye.

12:15.566 --> 12:17.400
He was talking about
fisting people.

12:17.401 --> 12:20.636
He just niced me.
I got niced.

12:20.637 --> 12:22.504
And where were you, Amy,
by the way?

12:22.505 --> 12:24.372
No, you said
you had it covered.

12:24.373 --> 12:26.475
No, I didn't have it covered.
And it's your job to know

12:26.476 --> 12:29.311
that if I say I have it covered, I don't
have it covered and you cover me.

12:29.312 --> 12:33.248
I need you all to make me
have not said that.

12:33.249 --> 12:36.118
I need you to have...
make me unsaid it.

12:36.119 --> 12:37.653
Let's just slow
down for a second.

12:37.654 --> 12:40.122
Make two columns, one with
filibuster, one with clean jobs,

12:40.123 --> 12:42.291
because now they are versus.

12:42.292 --> 12:44.860
Doyle gives us filibuster,
so put him there.

12:44.861 --> 12:47.896
Okay, but oil gives us
clean jobs.

12:47.897 --> 12:49.531
- Clean jobs is your legacy.
- Yes.

12:49.532 --> 12:51.266
<i>- Hold on a second.
- What?</i>

12:51.267 --> 12:55.903
What if we put an ex-oil
guy on the task force?

12:55.904 --> 12:57.515
<i>You see what I'm saying?</i>

12:57.516 --> 12:58.806
<i>Someone who's cozy with oil,
but not active oil.</i>

12:58.807 --> 13:01.508
- Former oil.
- That's lying.

13:01.509 --> 13:04.111
Creative semantics.

13:04.112 --> 13:06.847
Well, that's a creatively semantic
way of saying we're lying.

13:06.848 --> 13:08.282
Still creative.

13:08.283 --> 13:10.985
<i>Oh, hey, Jonah.
Jonah. Jonah.</i>

13:10.986 --> 13:13.088
<i>That we... yeah,
that we might like.</i>

13:13.089 --> 13:15.758
What I'm saying is that
we go with what I just said,

13:15.759 --> 13:18.160
the, um, the...

13:18.161 --> 13:20.330
Jamaican rum flavor.

13:21.899 --> 13:24.167
That's a really strong
flavor choice.

13:24.168 --> 13:25.968
I mean, it's unexpected,

13:25.969 --> 13:27.904
it's funky,
it's kind of sexual.

13:27.905 --> 13:31.174
Yeah, I don't want to make
too quick of a decision.

13:31.175 --> 13:33.950
Let's consider other flavors.

13:33.951 --> 13:38.560
- Like vanilla.
- Oh, c'mon. Vanilla is a girl's flavor.

13:38.561 --> 13:40.582
No, I have no choice here, Amy.

13:40.583 --> 13:42.917
Because I was backed
into a corner.

13:42.918 --> 13:45.920
So other flavors aren't
an option for me, okay?

13:45.921 --> 13:48.290
Perhaps if you had
done your job better,

13:48.291 --> 13:50.860
then, oh, I could choose
vanilla or chocolate

13:50.861 --> 13:53.096
or fucking blueberry
with fucking sprinkles on it.

13:53.097 --> 13:54.964
But that's not
an option for me, okay?

13:54.965 --> 13:56.967
<i>- That flavor's not an option for me.
- Okay.</i>

13:56.968 --> 13:58.903
You know, I think Jamaican
rum is a great choice.

13:58.904 --> 14:01.005
And your passion about
it is gonna sell it.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.274
I'm confused. Are we still
talking about yoghurt here?

14:03.275 --> 14:06.645
<i>- We're gonna go with Dan's idea.
- Okay.</i>

14:06.646 --> 14:09.547
Jamaican rum
is where we are headed.

14:09.548 --> 14:12.117
<i>- All right? Jamaican rum, mon.
- Okay.</i>

14:12.118 --> 14:14.019
( Laughs )
That's good.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.487
Maybe we don't need the accent.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.422
<i>- Hey, Dan.
- Yeah?</i>

14:17.423 --> 14:19.959
Leon West is down at
front security for you.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.127
Leon West?
Leon West is here for you?

14:22.128 --> 14:23.962
The journalist?
The beltway butcher?

14:23.963 --> 14:26.498
Don't you worry for one second,
all right?

14:26.499 --> 14:28.067
- I'm gonna take him to the yoghurt store.
- I'm not worried.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.236
Because you are gonna get rid of him.
You're gonna kill him

14:30.237 --> 14:33.506
and you're gonna do life for murder and
I never have to see your face again.

14:35.143 --> 14:37.011
You know, if I wash
my hands anymore,

14:37.012 --> 14:38.412
the bones are gonna
come through.

14:38.413 --> 14:40.148
Hey, where is Dan?

14:40.149 --> 14:42.183
He's at the yoghurt store.

14:42.184 --> 14:44.586
Gary, are you all right?
Are you getting the bug?

14:44.587 --> 14:47.122
No, I'm... oh!

14:47.123 --> 14:50.057
- Okay, you're not gonna like this.
- What?

14:50.058 --> 14:52.193
White House press guys
have just been in touch.

14:52.194 --> 14:54.595
Postus wants to announce
clean jobs task force

14:54.596 --> 14:57.497
next week when he is
back from Africa.

14:57.498 --> 15:01.378
We now go over live to the Vice President
for her pissed-off reaction.

15:01.379 --> 15:04.100
Come on. He wants to announce it
next week.

15:04.101 --> 15:06.238
- Yeah.
- Okay, it's my policy.

15:06.239 --> 15:09.742
- He's sliding in.
- Who knows? Yeah, that feels like a slide.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.978
- This happens every time, does it not?
- Yes.

15:11.979 --> 15:14.347
- It's like Charlie Brown and the football.
- Yeah.

15:14.348 --> 15:16.116
We're gonna have to
rewind this, okay?

15:16.117 --> 15:18.352
Because I've got Dan
backgrounding it right now.

15:18.353 --> 15:21.055
- What? You asked Dan to do that?
- Yeah, I did.

15:21.056 --> 15:23.792
I asked him because of the
whole "veep point two" thing.

15:23.793 --> 15:26.295
"Two point me."
( Groans )

15:26.296 --> 15:28.363
The "two point me" thing.

15:28.364 --> 15:30.532
Now you have to call him
and tell him to stay quiet.

15:30.533 --> 15:33.802
And you've got to go
down to that yoghurt store.

15:33.803 --> 15:36.004
You didn't just roll
your eyes, did you?

15:36.005 --> 15:38.106
- No, ma'am.
- 'Cause it sure looked like it to me.

15:38.107 --> 15:39.607
I can't stand that
passive-aggressive stuff.

15:39.608 --> 15:43.344
This whole day is turning
apocalyptic now.

15:43.345 --> 15:45.011
- Okay?
- ( Gary groaning )

15:45.012 --> 15:46.279
Okay.

15:47.248 --> 15:48.915
<i>Leon, hi.</i>

15:48.916 --> 15:51.918
- Just right in here.
- Okay, Dan, a very obscure rendezvous.

15:51.919 --> 15:53.886
So you either have a very
hot story for me,

15:53.887 --> 15:56.088
or you're going to shoot me.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.923
I have got a story for you.

15:57.924 --> 15:59.891
Things are about to get
very veep-tastic.

15:59.892 --> 16:02.760
- Mr. Egan. Good to see you.
- Anthony.

16:02.761 --> 16:04.195
How are you, sir?

16:04.196 --> 16:06.732
We are very excited about the
Vice President's visit today.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.638
<i>- Oh, as are we.
- My son has named a yoghurt after her.</i>

16:09.639 --> 16:12.572
Strawberry-Selina.
It's very tasty.

16:12.573 --> 16:14.107
- Great name.
- Who's this one?

16:14.108 --> 16:16.543
Leon West, ma'am.
"Washington Post."

16:16.544 --> 16:18.245
Oh, we don't get the "Post."

16:18.246 --> 16:21.348
This is an old, established
family store.

16:21.349 --> 16:25.586
And we spell yoghurt with an
H right there in the middle.

16:25.587 --> 16:26.988
I see that.
I'll make a note of it.

16:26.989 --> 16:28.956
Oh, hey, Dan.
You haven't been picking up your phone.

16:28.957 --> 16:31.292
Yeah, I've been
a little bit busy, Mike.

16:31.293 --> 16:33.727
- Hello, Leon.
- Hi, Mike.

16:33.728 --> 16:36.095
Mike, this is Anthony,
the owner of the store.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.697
<i>And his lovely mother Maria.</i>

16:37.698 --> 16:39.031
You have on
a very sweaty shirt.

16:39.032 --> 16:42.034
- ( All laugh )
- By golly, I do.

16:42.035 --> 16:44.637
She speaks her mind.
She's 84.

16:44.638 --> 16:47.440
No. I had you
pegged for 39, ma'am.

16:47.441 --> 16:49.509
Mike is so good with facts.

16:49.510 --> 16:53.246
We are both very big supporters
of this administration.

16:53.247 --> 16:54.948
We appreciate that.
Thank you.

16:54.949 --> 16:56.984
Although it's not always easy.

16:56.985 --> 16:59.286
A lot of taxes you guys impose.

16:59.287 --> 17:01.188
- A ton of taxes.
- Hold on a second.

17:01.189 --> 17:03.558
Those taxes
are eating us alive.

17:03.559 --> 17:04.992
- Gobble, gobble.
- This isn't officially...

17:04.993 --> 17:06.861
If you'd excuse us
for one moment.

17:06.862 --> 17:09.262
- Dan, can I talk to you for a second?
- Just one second.

17:09.263 --> 17:12.465
Potus Interruptus, that's what I call it.
And I'm gonna tell him.

17:12.467 --> 17:14.734
Madam Vice President, you can't go
back in there for future meetings.

17:14.736 --> 17:17.204
What? No.
Let me tell you something.

17:17.204 --> 17:20.240
You tell that shit-
for-brains President...

17:20.241 --> 17:22.541
Madam Vice President, if you would
listen to me for just one moment.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.344
No, I won't listen to you
for one second.

17:24.345 --> 17:26.746
- I'm not interested in...
- Please, be quiet!

17:26.747 --> 17:30.050
The President is experiencing
severe chest pains.

17:30.051 --> 17:31.518
We just got word
from South Africa.

17:31.519 --> 17:33.688
You need to get to
the west wing immediately.

17:33.689 --> 17:36.524
Oh.

17:36.525 --> 17:39.127
I'm so sorry.

17:39.128 --> 17:42.264
Ma'am, if you could just make your
way in this direction, please.

17:42.265 --> 17:44.800
Where are we going?

17:44.801 --> 17:47.503
We're gonna take you to the
White House situation room.

17:49.105 --> 17:51.239
<i>- Amy, are you here?
- I am right by your side.</i>

17:51.240 --> 17:53.174
<i>- Where is Gary? Gary, are you here?
- I'm right here.</i>

17:53.175 --> 17:56.076
I'm right here.
What the hell? I'm with her.

17:56.077 --> 17:57.377
Should we run?

17:57.378 --> 17:59.245
Leon West? Here?

17:59.246 --> 18:01.214
That's the fucking
beltway butcher.

18:01.215 --> 18:02.982
Have you told him
about clean jobs yet?

18:02.983 --> 18:05.217
I was just about to,
shit stack.

18:05.218 --> 18:08.086
- Enjoy, gentlemen.
- Oh, thank you.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.722
We got Leon West here
and nothing to give him.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.091
- I've got plenty to give him.
- No, you don't.

18:13.092 --> 18:16.594
Potus wants us to announce clean jobs
task force next week when he's in town.

18:16.595 --> 18:19.464
So you, my friend, have
your cock out at a funeral.

18:19.465 --> 18:21.499
- Sprinkles.
- Oh, come on.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.041
( Panting ) Oh, God.

18:29.042 --> 18:32.010
Do you ever write about
yoghurt in your newspaper?

18:32.011 --> 18:35.313
No, I don't.
I'm not a food writer.

18:35.314 --> 18:37.648
What do you write?

18:37.649 --> 18:39.249
I write about politics.

18:39.250 --> 18:43.487
I'm interested in lobbying,
advocacy groups.

18:43.488 --> 18:45.389
Do you know how
yoghurt is made?

18:45.390 --> 18:48.259
No, but I'm sure
it's fascinating.

18:48.260 --> 18:51.162
- Don't patronize me.
- All right, you got it.

18:55.401 --> 18:57.268
Oh, gentlemen.

18:57.269 --> 18:59.137
- Madam Vice President.
- Yes?

18:59.138 --> 19:00.872
These would need to be
dealt with pretty urgently

19:00.873 --> 19:02.307
should the situation
become more serious.

19:02.308 --> 19:05.277
We have a Captain Reynolds

19:05.278 --> 19:07.279
of the U.S.S.
Abraham Lincoln.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.448
Aircraft carrier.
( Sneezes )

19:09.449 --> 19:12.450
He's expecting a conference
call in about 15 minutes

19:12.451 --> 19:16.254
with the President, secretary
of state and general marsh.

19:16.255 --> 19:18.022
- Pentagon.
- Shh, shh.

19:18.023 --> 19:20.225
- Could you step in notionally?
- Yes.

19:20.226 --> 19:21.993
- Thank you.
- No problem at all. Thank you.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.129
Madam Vice President,
may I get you a cup of coffee?

19:24.130 --> 19:25.430
Oh, yes, thank you, Jonah.

19:25.431 --> 19:28.333
Excuse me.
Pardon me.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.234
Have you noticed how he's...

19:30.235 --> 19:31.970
Yeah, he thinks I'm about
to be his boss.

19:31.971 --> 19:34.672
<i>Yeah, he's gonna be the
first to go, by the way.</i>

19:34.673 --> 19:36.908
- Hmm, okay.
- Dead man walking.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.943
- Dan.
- Yes?

19:38.944 --> 19:42.013
Can I get a heads-up? 'Cause I'm standing
over here like a fucking meerkat.

19:42.014 --> 19:45.250
Yes. The truth is I had
a huge story to give you.

19:45.251 --> 19:47.987
- It's just been back-burnered.
- Oh, sorry.

19:47.988 --> 19:50.989
No, no, listen.
Mike is on his way out, all right?

19:50.990 --> 19:53.258
Either he or his arteries
are gonna quit any second.

19:53.259 --> 19:55.327
I'm the new face of
the veep's office, okay?

19:55.328 --> 19:58.664
- I can bring you major scoops.
- You can bring me major scoops?

19:58.665 --> 20:01.100
Hey, come on, I major in major.

20:01.101 --> 20:03.236
- Stop doing that.
- I'm sorry.

20:03.237 --> 20:04.637
Should I just put this
right here?

20:04.638 --> 20:06.773
- Yeah, just put it down, okay?
- Thank you.

20:06.774 --> 20:09.242
Um...

20:09.243 --> 20:12.078
If we could just have some quiet, please.
Thank you very much.

20:12.079 --> 20:14.513
<i>Quiet.</i>

20:14.514 --> 20:18.083
Ladies and gentlemen...
( Clears throat )

20:18.084 --> 20:21.553
We come here today
in togetherness

20:21.554 --> 20:24.556
and in hope...
certainly hope...

20:24.557 --> 20:28.894
for the swift recovery
of this great, great president

20:28.895 --> 20:32.297
who has been a...

20:32.298 --> 20:35.568
faultless G.P.S.

20:35.569 --> 20:37.737
in guiding our nation.

20:37.738 --> 20:41.908
We stand here today
with courage in our hearts...

20:41.909 --> 20:44.545
( Cough )

20:44.546 --> 20:46.847
Oh, Jesus Christ.

20:46.848 --> 20:49.717
Let us pray.

20:49.718 --> 20:52.286
( Groans )

20:52.287 --> 20:57.158
Holy mother of God
and sweet Jesus Christ.

20:59.862 --> 21:01.763
- Where is she?
- I apologize.

21:01.764 --> 21:03.831
We'll have some information
soon for you, okay, Anthony?

21:03.832 --> 21:07.201
And you know what? You guys can just act
naturally like you'd normally act.

21:07.202 --> 21:09.570
- Great. Brilliant normalizing.
- I'm normal.

21:09.571 --> 21:12.807
- Yes, sir. Where is she, Dan, huh?
- I don't know.

21:12.808 --> 21:14.575
My balls are comprehensively
busted here.

21:14.576 --> 21:17.312
- I'm down to my reserve pair.
- Look, Mike, I've got Sue.

21:17.313 --> 21:19.248
She's gonna call me any second.
Just give me a fucking break.

21:19.249 --> 21:22.084
- ( Phone chimes )
- Oh, bingo, Amy. I guess I'll fill you in.

21:22.085 --> 21:24.121
Amy, what the duck?

21:24.122 --> 21:26.075
That screaming, falling sound

21:26.076 --> 21:27.790
is my fucking patience
going out the window.

21:27.791 --> 21:29.392
Sue?

21:29.393 --> 21:31.194
Okay, Dan, listen up.
This is very important.

21:31.195 --> 21:32.795
The veep has gone
to the White House.

21:32.796 --> 21:34.696
<i>The President is having
a heart attack.</i>

21:34.697 --> 21:36.899
Dan, look at me
with your stupid eyes.

21:36.900 --> 21:39.368
Stop talking to that man, Dan.
Stop talking to that man and focus.

21:39.369 --> 21:42.104
Sue, can you please just repeat
that part on more time for me?

21:42.105 --> 21:44.941
Selina is currently the most
powerful woman in the world.

21:44.942 --> 21:48.479
<i>And obviously you cannot tell anyone
this or she will have you destroyed.</i>

21:48.480 --> 21:50.348
<i>- Understood?
- Dan...</i>

21:50.349 --> 21:53.051
You have to give me
something right now.

21:54.687 --> 21:57.356
Oh, fuck it, it's gonna break anyway.
Yeah, as a matter of fact,

21:57.357 --> 21:59.358
- Selina Meyers...
- Is gonna come here in a second

21:59.359 --> 22:01.528
and order Jamaican rum
with sprinkles.

22:02.563 --> 22:04.731
Okay, your working life

22:04.732 --> 22:08.301
just got 80% more fucked!
Okay?

22:08.302 --> 22:11.705
From now on, you bleached,
plucked asshole,

22:11.706 --> 22:15.071
I am your fucking
siamese stalker.

22:16.176 --> 22:18.644
Mike, always a pleasure to
see you be a stupid asshole.

22:18.645 --> 22:20.846
I'm hearing some language
that I don't like.

22:20.847 --> 22:23.215
<i>- Yeah?
- What are you saying?</i>

22:23.216 --> 22:25.517
- Forget it.
- No, wait a minute. What are you saying?

22:25.518 --> 22:27.518
- What is he talking about?
- Nothing. Nothing.

22:27.519 --> 22:30.722
No, you guys live
in your own little world

22:30.723 --> 22:33.392
with your heads stuck up
your Capitol Hill asses.

22:33.393 --> 22:36.596
And you, you gay, Irish
fireman... you, you're okay.

22:36.597 --> 22:39.032
But you, you I do not like.

22:39.033 --> 22:41.034
( Whispering )

22:41.035 --> 22:43.070
- Amy.
- Yeah?

22:43.071 --> 22:45.206
If Gary is sick,

22:45.207 --> 22:46.808
I'm gonna need
a temporary body man.

22:46.809 --> 22:49.744
Sure. Oh, and I told Sue
to drop the yoghurt store.

22:49.745 --> 22:52.480
I don't have room
in my head for yoghurt.

22:52.481 --> 22:54.516
Madam Vice President,
we've been asked to tell you

22:54.517 --> 22:56.952
that you may stand down.
The President is fine.

22:58.821 --> 23:01.791
Well, that's terrific news.

23:01.792 --> 23:03.459
<i>- Thank God.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

23:03.460 --> 23:06.162
Crossed wires.
Potus just suffered heartburn

23:06.163 --> 23:08.931
<i>after a traditional barbecue
at the state function.</i>

23:08.932 --> 23:11.668
Are you absolutely
sure that...

23:11.669 --> 23:13.836
No, the President is...

23:13.837 --> 23:15.872
back in charge
of the G.P.S.

23:15.873 --> 23:19.743
Super.
Super.

23:19.744 --> 23:21.878
Oh, and I'm sorry.
I just spoke to Mike.

23:21.879 --> 23:23.547
Yup.

23:23.548 --> 23:26.316
<i>He said that you were needed
down at a yoghurt store.</i>

23:26.317 --> 23:27.617
( Exhales )

23:27.618 --> 23:30.987
It was something about
damage control.

23:30.988 --> 23:33.590
Yeah.

23:33.591 --> 23:37.481
It's been an honor to serve such
an accomplished understudy, ma'am.

23:38.830 --> 23:40.730
- Are you gonna take those with you?
- What?

23:40.731 --> 23:44.201
Oh, I'm sorry.
Should I give that to you?

23:44.202 --> 23:45.869
- Thank you.
- Here's a pen.

23:45.870 --> 23:48.071
I'll put it back.
Do you want me to put it here?

23:48.072 --> 23:49.472
- That's fine. Great.
- Okay.

23:49.473 --> 23:51.074
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

23:51.075 --> 23:54.111
Bye-bye.

23:58.250 --> 24:00.751
( Sirens blaring )

24:03.321 --> 24:05.556
Ma'am, we spent
a nice afternoon bonding

24:05.557 --> 24:07.225
with these owners.
They're lovely people.

24:07.226 --> 24:09.426
A lot of the online
guys are still here.

24:09.427 --> 24:10.828
Online?
Are you serious?

24:10.829 --> 24:12.563
Yeah.
It's much more relevant.

24:12.564 --> 24:14.131
<i>I've been telling
Dan this for years.</i>

24:14.132 --> 24:17.334
- Wow, I do not feel good. I feel bad.
- You kidding?

24:17.335 --> 24:19.537
Really?
Like, where does it hurt?

24:19.538 --> 24:21.839
I don't know.
It's hard to define exactly.

24:21.840 --> 24:23.107
Where did Gary's thing start?

24:23.108 --> 24:25.442
His started in,
like, in his stomach.

24:25.443 --> 24:27.411
- It did start in his stomach?
- He lost color right away, though.

24:27.412 --> 24:29.880
<i>- And you still look...
- You look great.</i>

24:29.881 --> 24:31.182
- Do I?
- You look beautiful.

24:31.183 --> 24:32.983
Thank you.
Okay.

24:32.984 --> 24:35.352
Yeah, but aren't dairy products
bad for your stomach?

24:35.353 --> 24:36.887
You've got to eat
the yoghurt now.

24:36.888 --> 24:38.222
I mean, there will
be cameras on you.

24:38.223 --> 24:40.524
- This is life dairy defcon 1.
- Yeah, hi.

24:40.525 --> 24:42.392
Madam Vice President,
this is Anthony Holland,

24:42.393 --> 24:44.361
- the owner of the store.
- How do you do?

24:44.362 --> 24:47.064
Madam Vice President
welcome to Super Scooper.

24:47.065 --> 24:49.333
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

24:49.334 --> 24:51.369
I thought we'd do the photo
over here, if that's okay.

24:51.370 --> 24:53.138
Sure.
Do you have any

24:53.139 --> 24:55.140
Jamaican rum flavor?
( Gags )

24:55.141 --> 24:56.942
I'm sorry, I don't.

24:56.943 --> 24:59.845
And I've also thrown out
all of the Strawberry-Selina.

24:59.846 --> 25:01.914
- Oh.
- It had a bad taste.

25:01.915 --> 25:05.285
Oh, that's a shame
to hear that.

25:05.286 --> 25:07.854
All I have left is vanilla.

25:07.855 --> 25:09.422
- Okay.
- I hope you like that.

25:09.423 --> 25:11.524
- That'll be fine.
- Members of the media.

25:11.525 --> 25:12.825
<i>This is the media here.
Come on in, guys.</i>

25:12.826 --> 25:15.194
<i>- Just this?
- Yeah.</i>

25:15.195 --> 25:18.296
<i>- You guys will be right here.
- Oh, that's fantastic.</i>

25:18.297 --> 25:22.200
Yeah, well, it would have been
better about two hours ago.

25:22.201 --> 25:24.335
Amy, you're gonna need to...

25:24.336 --> 25:25.603
Of course.

25:25.604 --> 25:27.538
<i>- Amy.
- Yup.</i>

25:27.539 --> 25:30.041
- ( Chair squeaking )
- I know, it's just stuck.

25:30.042 --> 25:31.942
We're gonna do the picture?

25:31.943 --> 25:34.145
<i>All right, guys, get this shot.
It's real America.</i>

25:34.146 --> 25:36.480
<i>Bite and smile.</i>

25:39.050 --> 25:41.184
- Yeah?
- Mmm.

25:41.185 --> 25:42.919
- It's good, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

25:42.920 --> 25:44.487
<i>You know,
let's get one re.</i>

25:44.488 --> 25:46.623
<i>- ( Cameras clicking )
- Really quick.</i>

25:46.624 --> 25:48.324
I think you...
probably just one...

25:50.494 --> 25:53.729
Are you okay?

25:53.730 --> 25:55.964
- ( Gags )
- Can I get you something?

25:55.965 --> 25:58.366
I think we got it, guys.
Take a step back.

25:58.367 --> 26:00.601
( Groans ) I have to use
the bathroom right away.

26:00.602 --> 26:02.803
- Can we use your bathroom?
- No, I'm sorry, my mother is in there.

26:02.804 --> 26:04.905
She's 84.
She takes a while.

26:04.906 --> 26:06.807
- Okay, then we're gonna go, but thanks.
- Okay.

26:06.808 --> 26:10.111
Madam Vice President, are youna
do anything about taxes?

26:10.112 --> 26:12.080
Yeah, moving...
I'm moving them down.

26:12.081 --> 26:13.782
Oh, I don't know
where this is headed.

26:13.783 --> 26:15.651
Okay, let's go this way, then.

26:15.652 --> 26:19.322
Nice, we'll just move
to the car and get it...

26:19.323 --> 26:21.290
Moved quickly.

26:21.291 --> 26:25.662
Oh! Ooh-ooh!
Oooh-ooh!

26:25.663 --> 26:27.151
I can't...

26:27.152 --> 26:29.232
Do you need to squeeze my hand
or something?

26:29.233 --> 26:32.468
- What's up?
- Need help?

26:32.469 --> 26:35.004
- Okay.
- I can't uncross my legs.

26:35.005 --> 26:37.406
- Yeah.
- Oh, God. Okay. I get it.

26:37.407 --> 26:39.842
Uh, guys, we need a wall
around the Vice President.

26:39.843 --> 26:41.676
No photos.
No clean photos.

26:41.677 --> 26:44.378
- ( Selina groans )
- Here we go.

26:44.379 --> 26:46.647
Here we go. Let's move.
Car's open. Door open.

26:46.648 --> 26:48.782
Let's get her in.
Come on.

26:48.783 --> 26:50.451
