Owen. Gwen. Left into the alley,
right, 30 metres.

00:30.794 --> 00:33.125
What can you see?
I can't get a visual...

00:33.160 --> 00:37.160
Just a signal. Definitely alien in
origin. Diagonal right, towards the castle.

00:43.919 --> 00:47.164
Jack, sharp right, 20 metres.

00:47.199 --> 00:50.239
Can you identify the target?
Still trying to get a visual...

00:52.160 --> 00:53.440
20 seconds to contact.

00:56.479 --> 00:57.440
15 seconds.

00:58.159 --> 01:01.519
No heroics, we've got no idea
what we're dealing with.

01:02.280 --> 01:03.119
Ten seconds.

01:06.199 --> 01:07.600
Got it!

01:09.600 --> 01:13.039
Got a visual.
Suspect's male, wearing a hoodie.

01:15.559 --> 01:17.560
Go, Gwen!

01:32.599 --> 01:36.240
Come on! Open it up! Open it up!

01:46.959 --> 01:48.079
In trouble now, mate.

01:59.599 --> 02:02.444
Damn!

02:02.479 --> 02:05.000
You star, you did it!
I was that close...

02:05.880 --> 02:07.645
No, you got it.

02:07.680 --> 02:10.120
I've lost him, Tosh, I've lost him.

02:10.155 --> 02:12.360
I swear, whatever it is...

02:12.395 --> 02:14.040
You're holding it.

02:16.879 --> 02:19.480
Let me check the cameras.

Hello?

03:10.080 --> 03:11.640
Who are you?

03:14.359 --> 03:16.119
Can you hear me?

03:16.154 --> 03:17.880
I want to go home.

03:23.479 --> 03:26.799
No-one knows who I am here.

03:26.834 --> 03:29.400
I'm lost. Come back...

03:32.920 --> 03:34.319
Come back.

03:40.399 --> 03:42.400
ANNOUNCEMENT OVER TANNOY

03:44.559 --> 03:46.680
I'm sorry,
that damn gate cut us off.

03:47.720 --> 03:49.800
Gwen? Are you all right?

03:52.079 --> 03:53.800
I've just seen a ghost.

04:07.240 --> 04:09.800
This is the feed
from the station camera.

04:10.919 --> 04:12.479
Gwen grabs the kid.

04:13.319 --> 04:16.279
She's got his jacket, and
he just slips out. You OK with this?

04:16.315 --> 04:17.644
And then?

04:17.678 --> 04:20.079
Jack and Owen arrive.

04:23.160 --> 04:25.204
Then, nothing. Sorry.

04:25.239 --> 04:27.644
No. It was as real as this is.

04:27.679 --> 04:30.284
More real. I didn't
just see that boy. I could...

04:30.319 --> 04:35.285
I could hear what he was thinking,
I could feel it. Like I was lost.

04:35.320 --> 04:40.520
Intense emotion can be part of a neurological
event. Hallucinations, dementia...

04:40.555 --> 04:43.925
I wasn't hallucinating, Owen.
And I'm not bloody senile.

04:43.960 --> 04:47.320
You pushed this button which caused
this apparition moment? Yeah.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.479
Jack, please don't!
THEY ALL SHOUT "NO"

04:50.514 --> 04:52.279
As if! But that's how it felt.

04:52.314 --> 04:53.764
Like an apparition.

04:53.799 --> 04:56.204
A ghost. Toshiko, where do we start?

04:56.239 --> 05:01.679
The guy you were chasing, I've got lots of
CCTV, so tracking him down's gonna be easy.

05:01.714 --> 05:04.879
You said there was a name on the
card around the little boy's neck?

05:04.914 --> 05:08.204
Flanagan. Tom Erasmus Flanagan.
Unusual name, that'll help.

05:08.239 --> 05:12.280
Run a full check. Births, marriages,
deaths, criminal record, passports.

05:12.315 --> 05:15.120
However long it takes,
wherever he is, we'll find him.

05:15.155 --> 05:17.005
I've found him.

05:17.040 --> 05:22.680
Flanagan, Thomas Erasmus.
74 Brynaeron Terrace, Butetown.

05:22.715 --> 05:24.520
He's in the phonebook.

05:31.719 --> 05:35.285
Hi, I'm DI Cooper, this is DS Harper.

05:35.320 --> 05:38.880
Could you spare
a few minutes, please? Yeah, OK.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.844
Dad, visitors. It's the police.

05:44.879 --> 05:47.819
Oh! Caught up with me at last,
have you?

05:47.854 --> 05:50.725
I'm Gwen.
This is Owen, he's training.

05:50.760 --> 05:55.999
It's just routine
- we're looking for eye witnesses to an incident at the railway station last night.

05:56.034 --> 05:59.640
We were here, weren't we, Dad?
Strictly Come Dancing finals. Who won?

05:59.675 --> 06:02.440
That newsreader.
She's got legs up to her armpits!

06:02.475 --> 06:04.759
Would you like a cup of tea?

06:04.794 --> 06:06.405
I'd love one, thanks.

06:06.440 --> 06:09.360
Owen will give you a hand. This way.

06:09.395 --> 06:12.280
She'll talk him to death out there.

06:12.315 --> 06:14.245
He'll give as good as he gets.

06:14.280 --> 06:18.639
She was right, though. We were in all
last night, we wouldn't have seen anything.

06:18.674 --> 06:22.297
Just for the record,
you are Tom Erasmus Flanagan?

06:22.332 --> 06:25.920
My father was an Erasmus,
his father before him.

06:25.955 --> 06:28.965
Now, that's not
a Welsh accent, is it? No.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.679
Lived here 66 years,
and still sound like a barrow boy.

06:33.714 --> 06:38.245
I was evacuated during the war -
1941.

06:38.280 --> 06:41.484
The Germans bombing
the hell out of the East End.

06:41.519 --> 06:44.520
Cardiff was being bombed
as well as London, wasn't it?

06:44.555 --> 06:46.737
We were taken to the countryside.

06:46.772 --> 06:48.919
My mother packed me a suitcase...

06:50.199 --> 06:53.319
Big sister wrote my name on a card.

06:53.354 --> 06:56.405
They put me
on a train at Paddington.

06:56.440 --> 07:00.999
Kept saying I had to go, had to be
a good boy, telling me not to cry,

07:01.034 --> 07:03.399
and the pair of
them were crying their eyes out!

07:03.434 --> 07:07.565
That was the last I saw of them,

07:07.600 --> 07:10.400
though I didn't know
that then, of course.

07:10.435 --> 07:12.044
Waving goodbye.

07:12.079 --> 07:16.399
How old were you? Eight. You must
have been very, very frightened.

07:16.434 --> 07:19.977
I didn't know a soul here.
And there was a mix-up.

07:20.012 --> 07:23.520
I kept my head down so much
they forgot all about me.

07:23.555 --> 07:25.999
So they left me all on my own.

07:27.120 --> 07:30.040
Felt like the end of the world.

07:30.075 --> 07:32.960
I wandered down this tunnel,

07:32.995 --> 07:34.937
totally lost.

07:34.972 --> 07:36.844
Forgotten.

07:36.879 --> 07:40.479
Looking for someone,
anyone, who'd look after me.

07:40.514 --> 07:44.080
"Why don't they
come for me?" I kept thinking.

07:44.115 --> 07:46.604
No-one knows me. I'm lost.

07:46.639 --> 07:51.005
They worked it out in the end,
they came back for me,

07:51.040 --> 07:55.779
and I got taken in by a lovely
couple, no kids of their own.

07:55.814 --> 08:00.519
And well, at the end of the war,
I had no-one left in London.

08:00.554 --> 08:03.017
So I stayed here.

08:03.052 --> 08:05.480
I'm still here now.

08:05.515 --> 08:06.799
Just!

08:09.679 --> 08:11.005
I don't get it.

08:11.040 --> 08:13.765
He WAS the boy at the station.

08:13.800 --> 08:17.799
I can't comment
- I was stuck in the kitchen with Motormouth, thanks to you.

08:17.834 --> 08:21.280
So was what I saw just a bit of him
from years before? Hanging around?

08:27.119 --> 08:31.200
Hi. Gwen, I'm just putting a wash
on, you got any whites need doing?

08:32.245 --> 08:34.063
I don't know.
Just leave it, I'll sort it out.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.645
No, no, no it's no trouble.

08:35.679 --> 08:39.159
Just remind me, which drawer do the
tablets go in? Ah, just leave it.

08:39.195 --> 08:42.724
OK, so, are you in or out tonight?
I don't know.

08:42.759 --> 08:45.725
Again?! Sorry? All I'm asking
is you in or out tonight?

08:45.760 --> 08:48.919
I don't know. I can live
with all the Secret Squirrel stuff,

08:48.954 --> 08:51.605
but if you can't even tell
me if you're coming home!

08:51.640 --> 08:55.159
Well, nagging isn't helping.
Right. Well, that's me told.

08:55.194 --> 08:57.644
Aw, Rhys... I'm not staying in
on the off chance.

08:57.679 --> 09:00.720
Daf's having mates round.
I'll stay there. Do what you want.

09:00.755 --> 09:02.959
CAR HORN BEEPS

09:02.994 --> 09:04.160
Hello?

09:10.240 --> 09:12.679
All right!
ENGINE REVS

09:20.239 --> 09:23.360
Our friend
with the alien machine in his pocket

09:23.395 --> 09:26.565
is one Sean Harris
aka Bernie.

09:26.600 --> 09:30.524
And what he's doing with an
alien machine is anyone's guess.

09:30.559 --> 09:34.759
19. String of convictions - burglary,
shoplifting, credit cards...

09:34.794 --> 09:37.285
Do warn me if he's dropping in

09:37.320 --> 09:40.044
The theft conviction -
he was stealing tyres off a car

09:40.079 --> 09:45.199
when the owner turns up, gives him so much grief,
he apologises. starts putting them back on again.

09:45.234 --> 09:48.879
Which is when the police show up!
And here - shoplifting conviction.

09:48.914 --> 09:52.159
Bottle of vodka and three Pot
Noodles. A criminal mastermind

09:53.959 --> 09:58.239
Got anywhere with that
mystery object? Alien, of course...

09:58.274 --> 10:02.217
Gorgeous nanotechnology,
makes NASA look like Toys 'R' US.

10:02.252 --> 10:06.160
Well, you've really narrowed
things down, haven't you?

10:06.195 --> 10:08.564
At the station it was doing this.
When I held it,

10:08.599 --> 10:11.959
it lit up and went mad.
It's not doing it now, is it? No.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.560
So. What next?

10:16.000 --> 10:18.440
This kid, Bernie,
where does he live? Splott.

10:18.475 --> 10:21.205
Splott?

10:21.240 --> 10:26.120
I believe estate agents
pronounce it "Sploe".

10:28.359 --> 10:32.599
Hi, I'm looking for Bernie, is he in?
Friend of his, are you? Yes, I'm from...

10:32.634 --> 10:35.524
I'm his mother. He's a
robbing little bastard

10:35.559 --> 10:38.600
who won't set foot in here
till he pays me the £50 he owes me!

10:40.600 --> 10:42.040
He's barred.

10:43.680 --> 10:46.759
He said he'd get me a iPod and
he never. And he smoked my fags.

10:46.794 --> 10:49.164
Wouldn't piss on him
if he was on fire.

10:49.199 --> 10:52.480
Bernie Harris, the
Scarlet Pimpernel of Splott.

10:52.515 --> 10:55.765
Tell me about it,
give me aliens any day.

10:55.800 --> 11:01.160
Any luck? Nope, but I got
four pasties for a pound - anyone?

11:01.195 --> 11:03.919
If I wanted days like this
I'd've stayed in the police.

11:05.640 --> 11:06.600
We did try, Jack.

11:16.640 --> 11:20.399
What's he gonna tell us? "Got it
off an alien down the market. "

11:20.434 --> 11:21.485
Where are we going?

11:21.520 --> 11:23.765
To the station.
Controlled experiment.

11:23.800 --> 11:29.560
We replicate the original events as far as
possible. Observe and analyse the results.

11:29.595 --> 11:35.119
What I have to do that again?!
Someone does - any volunteers? Whoa!

11:35.154 --> 11:37.840
We don't know what
it is, what it does. Nope.

11:37.875 --> 11:40.085
Jack, this could be dangerous. Yep.

11:40.120 --> 11:43.325
Don't mean to be picky, but I think
I can spot some flaws in this...

11:43.360 --> 11:47.320
I'm sorry, I thought you gave up looking
for a 19-year-old kid this morning

11:47.355 --> 11:51.120
I figured maybe you were after
something more exciting.

11:51.155 --> 11:52.719
A bit of a challenge.

11:54.600 --> 11:58.119
This door-to-door stuff
never gets us anywhere.

11:58.154 --> 12:01.879
BEEPING
Guys, come here! Owen!

12:01.914 --> 12:03.156
Owen!

12:03.191 --> 12:04.399
Wait...!

12:07.039 --> 12:09.079
THUNDER RUMBLES

12:09.114 --> 12:11.160
RAIN

12:30.799 --> 12:32.559
WOMAN WEEPS

12:40.159 --> 12:43.200
He's a rotten bastard!

12:44.679 --> 12:48.565
My mam was right,
his eyes are too close together!

12:48.600 --> 12:53.525
I said, "Just a dance,"
but he wasn't having a bar of it.

12:53.560 --> 12:57.000
I shouldn't have gone outside with
him, I should have known better!

12:58.960 --> 13:00.325
What's your name?

13:00.360 --> 13:02.359
Lizzie!

13:04.359 --> 13:06.440
Lizzie Lewis...

13:19.000 --> 13:21.004
You're a bad one, Ed Morgan!

13:21.039 --> 13:23.959
The girls said not to go
with you, and they were right.

13:23.994 --> 13:25.399
Am I bad?

13:26.760 --> 13:28.560
Am I a bad boy?

13:29.599 --> 13:31.960
You're a big girl now, Lizzie.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.800
You can make your own decisions.

13:37.080 --> 13:39.640
That's why I like you.

13:41.480 --> 13:43.445
You're not like the others.

13:43.480 --> 13:46.680
You don't follow the herd.
You're smart.

13:48.319 --> 13:52.279
Don't you like it that someone
can see how smart you are?

13:52.314 --> 13:53.719
Hmm?

13:55.999 --> 13:58.099
I can see you, Lizzie.

13:58.134 --> 14:00.200
The way you really are.

14:22.479 --> 14:23.559
SHE SCREAMS

14:28.480 --> 14:31.779
I don't want to hurt you, I don't...

14:31.814 --> 14:35.079
I- I told my mam I'd be home by 9!

14:35.114 --> 14:36.559
Shhhh...

14:42.679 --> 14:44.285
PLEASE!

14:44.320 --> 14:45.960
Oh, God, someone help me!

14:50.320 --> 14:52.700
Help me!

14:52.735 --> 14:55.080
Help me...!

14:58.960 --> 15:01.319
Owen? Are you all right?

15:01.354 --> 15:03.679
She... she was so scared!

15:04.719 --> 15:06.259
I- I-I couldn't...

15:06.294 --> 15:07.800
I couldn't move!

15:09.919 --> 15:11.400
I couldn't help her!

15:24.919 --> 15:28.279
The first time, it happens to Gwen.
A boy, at the railway station.

15:28.314 --> 15:32.719
Who's now in his 70s, alive and
well, and living in Butetown.

15:32.754 --> 15:34.805
The second time it happens to Owen.

15:34.840 --> 15:39.520
Like me, you didn't just see it,
you felt emotions that weren't yours.

15:39.555 --> 15:41.440
She was terrified.

15:42.479 --> 15:44.879
The victim's name was Lizzie.

15:44.914 --> 15:47.244
It was maybe 40, 45 years ago.

15:47.279 --> 15:49.679
Toshiko, do we know anything
about her yet?

15:50.120 --> 15:54.640
Elizabeth Lewis. Lizzie. Only child
of Mabel Ann Lewis of Hafod Street.

15:54.675 --> 15:57.685
Died March 29th, 1963.

15:57.720 --> 16:00.600
Raped and murdered on
Penfro Street, under the bridge.

16:00.635 --> 16:03.084
17 years old. He killed her.

16:03.119 --> 16:06.720
No-one was brought to trial. She
told her Mum she'd be home by nine.

16:08.840 --> 16:13.479
So what about Ed Morgan? That's what she
called him. "You're a bad one, Ed Morgan"

16:13.514 --> 16:16.405
Look him up.
It's kind of a common name.

16:16.440 --> 16:20.239
What's the connection? Where did they
come from? It's like being haunted.

16:20.274 --> 16:22.039
Quantum transducer!

16:22.074 --> 16:23.844
Look.

16:23.879 --> 16:26.839
Wow. I'd kill to get one of those.

16:28.279 --> 16:32.484
Transducers convert energy
from one form into another.

16:32.519 --> 16:36.125
They're in headphones. They convert
electrical signals into sound.

16:36.160 --> 16:39.960
They're in this device too converting
quantum energy and amplifying it.

16:39.995 --> 16:42.840
Into ghosts? Of course. It's emotion.

16:42.875 --> 16:44.805
Human emotion is energy.

16:44.840 --> 16:49.300
You can't always see it, or hear it,
but you can feel it.

16:49.335 --> 16:53.760
Ever had deja vu?
Felt someone "walk over your grave?"

16:53.795 --> 16:56.160
Ever felt someone
behind you in an empty room?

16:56.195 --> 16:58.484
Well. There was.

16:58.519 --> 17:00.845
There always is. A ghost.

17:00.880 --> 17:04.520
What else have we got on
Lizzie Lewis, what else have we got?

17:04.555 --> 17:07.645
Um. 1963- the records
aren't always that detailed.

17:07.680 --> 17:11.200
What about newspapers? Witness
statements, coroners' reports. Owen!

17:11.234 --> 17:12.605
What do you want me to find?

17:12.640 --> 17:15.679
To re-open the case you need
new evidence, or a new witness.

17:15.714 --> 17:18.045
I saw it happen.
You didn't! You weren't there.

17:18.079 --> 17:22.439
You saw the echo of a moment,
amplified by alien technology.

17:22.473 --> 17:25.000
So just tell me
how that will play in court?

17:25.035 --> 17:26.884
Since when did we care about court?

17:26.919 --> 17:31.360
Tomorrow we look for Bernie Harris and find
out what he knows about this ghost machine.

17:31.395 --> 17:34.240
We do our job and find
where this thing came from.

17:34.275 --> 17:35.279
Now, go home.

17:37.320 --> 17:39.239
Gwen! With me!

17:55.680 --> 17:56.640
Jack?

18:00.600 --> 18:01.560
Whoa.

18:05.200 --> 18:08.119
You need to know how to use these.

18:09.039 --> 18:11.479
Though I hope you never have to.

18:13.399 --> 18:15.039
So, do I...

18:15.074 --> 18:16.645
SHE LAUGHS

18:16.680 --> 18:20.239
I'm sorry, it's just... I don't
even kill spiders in the bath.

18:20.274 --> 18:23.079
Nor do I, not with a gun.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.600
It's all yours.

18:43.840 --> 18:45.480
Target's that way.

18:45.515 --> 18:47.119
Right.

18:48.600 --> 18:51.480
Let's leave the roof
in one piece, shall we?

18:53.080 --> 18:55.200
One hand, not two.

18:58.200 --> 18:59.839
Turn sideways to the target.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.519
Looking along your
shoulder, down your arm,

19:11.520 --> 19:14.439
a straight line to the sights.

19:14.474 --> 19:16.096
Bring up the gun.

19:16.131 --> 19:17.719
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

19:18.720 --> 19:21.205
Too fast.

19:21.240 --> 19:23.520
It's all in the breathing.

19:27.799 --> 19:31.480
Hold it firmly, don't grip it.

19:40.039 --> 19:43.680
Breathe in. Focus.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.720
Breathe out.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.280
Squeeze gently.

19:58.840 --> 20:01.279
That was a joint effort.

20:01.314 --> 20:02.804
Try it again.

20:02.839 --> 20:05.640
This time on your own,
and remember, breathe in.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.599
Don't grip it too tight.

20:15.599 --> 20:18.120
Hold it and cock it back.
I didn't cock it right.

20:19.999 --> 20:22.000
Nice and slow.

20:23.239 --> 20:25.519
Up a little. Yeah.

20:26.599 --> 20:28.680
Breathe first, then go.

20:36.439 --> 20:38.239
You know how to do it.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.080
Two hands or one? One.

20:51.240 --> 20:53.760
Woo-hoo! Wow!

20:55.000 --> 20:56.924
Nice work!

20:56.959 --> 21:00.039
Like I said,
I hope you never have to use 'em.

21:00.074 --> 21:01.039
Yeah.

21:02.479 --> 21:04.685
Oh, God, look at the time.

21:04.720 --> 21:09.880
When do you get to go home? You
seem to live here. You don't, do you?

21:09.915 --> 21:14.080
Gotta be ready, the 21st
century's when it all changes.

21:14.115 --> 21:16.197
And I hate to commute.

21:16.232 --> 21:18.244
Where do you sleep?

21:18.279 --> 21:21.359
I don't.
Doesn't it get lonely, at night?

21:25.519 --> 21:28.159
I'd better get back,
Rhys'll be wondering where I am.

21:31.239 --> 21:33.120
Goodnight. Goodnight.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.399
Hello?

21:42.434 --> 21:43.719
DOOR SLAMS

21:58.840 --> 22:01.844
'Hi, it's me here, I'm at Daf's

22:01.879 --> 22:04.000
'playing poker, and I'm winning!
Ha-hey!

22:04.035 --> 22:05.964
'Look, just so you know, erm,

22:05.999 --> 22:09.720
'I-I-I put your whites on earlier,
even though you were bloody grumpy.

22:09.755 --> 22:12.799
'They're still in the machine
so you'll need to hang them up.

22:12.834 --> 22:15.644
'I've out the bins out,
but I didn't do the washing-up.

22:15.679 --> 22:19.919
'But there's not much of that so... and
you haven't done it for weeks anyway. Ha-ha!

22:19.954 --> 22:21.720
'I'll see you when I see ya. Ta-ra. '

22:21.755 --> 22:23.399
ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS

22:26.720 --> 22:27.879
THUNDER RUMBLES

22:28.920 --> 22:31.119
Li-zzie!

22:31.154 --> 22:33.284
WOMAN CRIES

22:33.319 --> 22:38.764
Lizzie Lewis... You're a bad one,
Ed Morgan. Are you the-ere?

22:38.799 --> 22:42.360
The girls said not to go with you
and they were right! Am I that bad?

22:42.395 --> 22:43.645
Li-zzie...

22:43.680 --> 22:45.559
Am I a bad boy?

22:45.594 --> 22:47.404
WOMAN CRYING

22:47.439 --> 22:48.960
Lizzie Lewis... Help me!

22:48.995 --> 22:51.040
Help me!

23:07.960 --> 23:12.040
So, I've got to stay out
of trouble now, have I?

23:12.075 --> 23:14.045
Best behaviour.

23:14.080 --> 23:19.600
I'm a fully-trained police officer, I'll have
you on the floor and handcuffed like that.

23:19.635 --> 23:22.159
Mm-mm! Promises, promises!

23:23.680 --> 23:25.080
I'm so proud of you.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.400
CAR HORN BEEPS

23:41.435 --> 23:42.679
Rhys!

23:43.600 --> 23:48.200
The taxi's here, we're gonna be late! I haven't
worn these since the Luckley's interview.

23:50.319 --> 23:55.400
I'll wear jeans with a shirt and tie. It's mum's
60th. She wanted us smart, that's the whole point.

23:55.435 --> 23:59.040
I bust my zip! I'll be flashing my
family allowance if I'm not careful.

23:59.075 --> 24:01.405
What are you doing? Come on.
You're joking.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.800
I'll staple it! You're not coming
near my valuables with that.

24:19.360 --> 24:20.320
Hiya.

24:21.640 --> 24:24.325
Daf and Karen had a barney.

24:24.360 --> 24:27.720
She's making him sleep in the
spare room. I didn't fancy the sofa.

24:27.755 --> 24:31.805
Look, I don't mind
you working all the hours.

24:31.840 --> 24:36.280
I really don't. As long as you still
want to come home at the end of it.

24:36.315 --> 24:39.965
I do. I'm here.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.400
And you're gorgeous.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.919
Bet you haven't hung the washing up.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.360
Let's leave it
till tomorrow, eh? Aye.

26:24.719 --> 26:26.560
Who is it? Mr Morgan?

26:32.719 --> 26:35.119
What do you want?

26:35.154 --> 26:37.484
Well? Mr Morgan.

26:37.519 --> 26:41.079
I need to come in. Who said there
was gas? I can't smell anything.

26:41.114 --> 26:44.640
There's nothing wrong. I'd have
noticed. Can you smell anything?

26:46.040 --> 26:50.160
Was it next door? Can we go
into the living room, Mr Morgan?

26:59.680 --> 27:01.564
There's nothing in here.

27:01.599 --> 27:05.319
No gas fire, I mean -
I haven't got one.

27:05.354 --> 27:06.919
There's an electric heater.

27:07.959 --> 27:09.285
I don't hardly use it.

27:09.320 --> 27:11.680
What are you looking for?
Sit down, Mr Morgan.

27:11.715 --> 27:14.284
Was it next door?

27:14.319 --> 27:18.880
She can't mind her own business. Something
wrong with her. She makes stuff up. Is it her?

27:18.915 --> 27:20.725
You won't find anything, if it is.

27:20.760 --> 27:23.559
It's all in her head, know
what I mean? What's your name?

27:26.400 --> 27:29.319
How long
have you lived here, Mr Morgan?

27:29.354 --> 27:31.684
Years. This was my mam's house.

27:31.719 --> 27:35.640
You'd remember your neighbours. People
who lived in this street a while ago?

27:35.675 --> 27:38.520
People who lived... just round
the corner?

27:38.555 --> 27:40.120
Like in Hafod Street?

27:41.160 --> 27:42.325
Like...

27:42.360 --> 27:46.879
Mabel Lewis? She only passed away
a few years ago, did you know?

27:46.914 --> 27:49.844
Of course, she'd moved away
long before that.

27:49.879 --> 27:54.440
Couldn't bear the memories.
Her daughter. Her only child.

27:54.475 --> 27:56.297
Died in '63.

27:56.332 --> 27:57.885
HEARTBEAT

27:57.920 --> 27:59.404
Lizzie.

27:59.439 --> 28:02.719
Little Lizzie Lewis.

28:04.279 --> 28:06.240
She loved dancing. Do you remember?

28:06.275 --> 28:08.444
You should.

28:08.479 --> 28:10.844
Pretty girl. Blonde hair, blue eyes.

28:10.879 --> 28:16.200
Used to wear a little pink coat. Bet
she saved all her pennies to get that.

28:16.235 --> 28:18.005
All the rage.

28:18.040 --> 28:20.800
She was wearing it
last time you saw her.

28:20.835 --> 28:23.680
Last time anyone saw her.

28:24.719 --> 28:25.839
Alive.

28:29.080 --> 28:31.000
Remember now?

28:49.639 --> 28:52.920
I know what you did, Ed Morgan.

28:54.039 --> 29:00.160
And here you are, just... living
your life... free as a bird.

29:00.195 --> 29:02.919
Lizzie told her mother
she'd be home at nine.

29:02.954 --> 29:05.400
"Please don't," she said. "Please. "

29:05.435 --> 29:06.319
PLEASE!

29:07.399 --> 29:09.439
"You're a bad one, Ed Morgan. "

29:10.480 --> 29:14.359
"The girls said not to go with you,

29:14.394 --> 29:16.677
"and they were right. "

29:16.712 --> 29:18.925
Get out! Get out! GET OUT!

29:18.960 --> 29:24.559
You thought you'd got away with it! You'll get
nothing from me! I told you before, you'll get nothing!

29:24.594 --> 29:27.439
Get out of my house!

29:56.560 --> 29:58.240
Bernie Harris!

30:06.640 --> 30:08.040
Oi!

30:09.199 --> 30:10.920
You mind out! Sorry!

30:11.599 --> 30:13.320
Sorry!

30:18.079 --> 30:19.919
Go on! Kick his head in!

30:46.159 --> 30:49.379
Mam, there's a man in the garden!

30:49.414 --> 30:52.600
There's TWO men in the garden!

31:05.119 --> 31:07.459
Bernie Harris! Who?

31:07.494 --> 31:09.765
That wasn't a question.

31:09.800 --> 31:12.000
Don't hurt me please, I got asthma.

31:12.035 --> 31:13.440
I'm not going to hurt ya.

31:15.599 --> 31:17.280
I'm going to bloody kill ya.

31:18.720 --> 31:22.879
Why do they call you "Bernie"? I burned my
neighbour's shed down when I was 12. Why?

31:22.914 --> 31:25.205
I was having a fag.
Got a bit carried away.

31:25.240 --> 31:29.804
Well, this IS cosy.
I hope he bought you flowers.

31:29.839 --> 31:33.120
If this is about the dodgy fags,
I don't know what happened to 'em.

31:36.399 --> 31:37.804
Well.

31:37.839 --> 31:41.080
It's worth knowing, we're probably
the only people you can tell.

31:44.079 --> 31:47.459
Me and a mate was using this
lock up, down on Moira Street.

31:47.494 --> 31:50.606
Used to belong to this old guy.
Soft in the head, he was.

31:50.641 --> 31:53.684
Still loads of his stuff
in there but we chucked most of it.

31:53.719 --> 32:00.239
There was this old biscuit tin full of
foreign coins, weird bits of rock, and that.

32:00.274 --> 32:05.199
Thought it might be worth something.
Take it down the Antiques Roadshow.

32:05.234 --> 32:07.724
Yeah You don't know.
Cash In The Attic, all that.

32:07.759 --> 32:12.480
So I takes the tin home with me
and that thing switched itself on.

32:12.515 --> 32:15.177
It makes you see things.

32:15.212 --> 32:17.804
Real things. Real people.

32:17.839 --> 32:20.765
I was down the Old Wharf,
in the bay.

32:20.800 --> 32:23.804
I seen this woman, with a bundle,
something wrapped up.

32:23.839 --> 32:28.079
It was night time. She was putting
it into the water all secret like.

32:29.239 --> 32:33.285
It was weird cos it was
like I was her, somehow.

32:33.320 --> 32:36.600
She was scared, because she knew
what she was doing was wrong.

32:36.635 --> 32:39.404
I knew, without seeing.

32:39.439 --> 32:42.479
It was her baby, wrapped up.

32:42.514 --> 32:45.484
Dead. She hadn't told anyone.

32:45.519 --> 32:49.165
Then she just ran away.
And I realised, I KNEW her.

32:49.200 --> 32:52.559
She's old now, but she lives up
by the Catholic Church in Splott.

32:52.594 --> 32:55.045
So I goes up to see her.
Told her what I'd seen.

32:55.080 --> 32:57.800
She give me money not to tell
anyone. You blackmailed her?

32:57.835 --> 32:59.485
She offered.

32:59.520 --> 33:02.199
I've seen things
you wouldn't believe.

33:02.234 --> 33:05.137
There's the old bridge,
on Penfro Street.

33:05.172 --> 33:08.005
I saw a man... and a girl,
from ages ago.

33:08.040 --> 33:11.040
He was following her back from
a dance, along the canal... Yeah.

33:11.075 --> 33:13.924
I know, I saw it.

33:13.959 --> 33:16.204
He doesn't know anything, does he?

33:16.239 --> 33:20.599
It's been fascinating meeting you. Where
you going? That's mine! You can't walk off.

33:20.634 --> 33:23.359
I've got rights. So you don't
want the other half, then?

33:27.160 --> 33:29.239
The other half.

33:30.799 --> 33:33.679
Weird bits of rock. Foreign money.

33:33.714 --> 33:35.319
Alien rock.

33:36.600 --> 33:39.960
Alien money. Driftwood,
washing in through the rift.

33:42.240 --> 33:45.559
So, Bernie. Was this thing
in two halves when you found it?

33:45.594 --> 33:47.880
I've got it...
Like clicking Lego together.

33:51.399 --> 33:54.559
You split this into two pieces,
didn't you? C'mon, you lot.

33:55.800 --> 33:58.764
We'll take these too, if you
don't mind. Come on, you lot!

33:58.799 --> 34:02.200
Aren't you gonna arrest me? We're not
the police. But I stole it. I know.

34:02.235 --> 34:06.159
And you're going to rob it
back off me. So call the cops.

34:06.194 --> 34:08.005
Don't go!

34:08.040 --> 34:09.964
I only used it once...

34:09.998 --> 34:12.400
.. That half.
Anyway I couldn't use it again.

34:12.435 --> 34:15.125
Why not? I'm going to die.

34:15.159 --> 34:19.059
I've seen it happen,
out there on the road.

34:19.094 --> 34:22.266
I'm just lying there,
bleeding, and then I die.

34:22.302 --> 34:25.440
Just like I am now, not old.
What do you mean?

34:25.475 --> 34:28.559
Come on, Gwen!
I'm gonna be 20 in July.

34:28.594 --> 34:30.639
Do I die before then? GWEN!

34:32.360 --> 34:35.560
Just wait there, I'm coming back.

34:39.438 --> 34:40.998
Jack!

34:53.199 --> 34:54.405
Jack!

34:54.440 --> 34:56.320
Jack, I need to speak to you.

34:58.840 --> 35:02.599
Gwen, no-oh-oh-oh!

35:10.399 --> 35:11.439
Hello?

35:20.160 --> 35:21.925
Help me, please...

35:21.960 --> 35:24.039
I was too late, I couldn't stop it.

35:24.074 --> 35:26.080
Stop what? He's dead.

35:29.719 --> 35:32.285
Owen had the knife.

35:32.320 --> 35:37.279
He wanted to kill him.
Owen? Oh God, I couldn't stop it!

35:37.314 --> 35:38.760
Help me!

35:45.199 --> 35:47.160
Christ, Gwen,
what were you thinking?

35:52.159 --> 35:54.085
I didn't see him.

35:54.120 --> 35:58.680
I didn't see anyone but me.
I just said his name. Owen.

36:00.600 --> 36:04.639
Bernie said he saw himself, dead in
that street. You saw Owen with the knife.

36:04.674 --> 36:07.716
But I was holding it.
My hands were covered in blood.

36:07.751 --> 36:11.155
That was one future,
one of many possible futures.

36:11.190 --> 36:14.560
Whatever you saw, what Bernie saw,
might not happen.

36:14.595 --> 36:16.364
Might not?!

36:16.399 --> 36:18.405
Can't we find out?

36:18.440 --> 36:24.919
You've got all this stuff, alien stuff
- isn't there anything that can help? I'm sorry.

36:27.599 --> 36:30.164
I wish we'd never found it.

36:30.199 --> 36:32.520
Poor Bernie. Seeing himself dead.

36:32.555 --> 36:34.997
He might not be.

36:35.032 --> 36:37.405
Possible futures.

36:37.440 --> 36:40.960
He might like to know that. You're
certainly finding it a comfort

36:45.480 --> 36:46.920
I don't know what to do.

37:12.719 --> 37:16.320
I found your Ed Morgan earlier -
did a trace.

37:19.159 --> 37:22.999
I found him too. Phone book.

37:23.034 --> 37:24.897
Took all night.

37:24.932 --> 37:26.725
But I found him.

37:26.760 --> 37:30.079
Paid him a visit this morning,
put the fear of God into him.

37:31.719 --> 37:34.645
What did you find?
His medical records.

37:34.680 --> 37:39.879
He's claustrophobic, paranoid, depressive,
got a couple of recorded attempts of suicide.

37:39.914 --> 37:41.924
He's barely left his house in years.

37:41.959 --> 37:46.519
Look Owen, if Jack finds out...
Well, he won't, will he?

38:38.760 --> 38:39.844
Hello?

38:39.879 --> 38:41.605
I think he thought I wanted money.

38:41.640 --> 38:45.799
He kept saying, "You'll get
nothing from me. " Paranoia. Yeah...

38:45.834 --> 38:50.919
He said, "You'll get
nothing from me. Leave me alone.

38:52.879 --> 38:54.880
"I've told you before. "

38:54.915 --> 38:55.999
Told who?

39:02.880 --> 39:05.479
'Look, I've seen things
you wouldn't believe.

39:05.514 --> 39:08.617
'There's the old bridge,
down on Penfro Street.

39:08.652 --> 39:11.685
'There was a man... and a girl,
from ages ago.

Bernie, it's Gwen.

39:30.279 --> 39:31.719
Can I come in?

39:33.480 --> 39:34.959
Thanks.

39:37.920 --> 39:40.759
I know it sounds mad,
but just because you saw yourself...

39:40.794 --> 39:44.044
Dead, yeah.
Doesn't mean it's gonna happen.

39:44.079 --> 39:48.280
But you don't know how to stop it.
For you, or for me.

39:49.639 --> 39:52.359
It's got
right into my head, this thing.

Jack?

Ed Morgan. Owen went freelance
earlier and paid him a visit.

40:04.194 --> 40:07.765
Wanted to frighten him.
Sounds like he succeeded.

40:07.800 --> 40:11.400
I think Bernie Harris got
there first. Tried to blackmail him.

40:11.435 --> 40:13.244
Bernie was blackmailing him?!

40:13.279 --> 40:17.759
Looks that way. Ed thought Owen was part
of the same outfit. Are you home yet?

40:17.794 --> 40:22.239
No. I'm at Bernie's place. We're heading
over, stay right there. Owen, with me!

40:22.274 --> 40:25.759
Tosh, keep an eye on CCTV,
in case Bernie makes a run for it.

40:32.199 --> 40:36.280
So you saw Ed Morgan assaulting that girl
and thought you'd make some money out of it.

40:40.720 --> 40:44.239
"Diagnosed with severe depression.
Agoraphobic. "

Coming onto Evelyn Street.
That's Bernie's street!

He's heading for Bernie's flat.

We're on our way, are you OK?

41:24.079 --> 41:27.760
Yeah, I would be, if someone
would just... just tell me...

41:28.840 --> 41:31.680
I'm gonna die. I've seen it happen,
out there on the road.

41:31.715 --> 41:34.360
Bernie said he saw himself dead
in that road?

41:34.395 --> 41:37.360
Gwen?! Gwen!

41:48.120 --> 41:51.279
I knew you'd find me in the end.

41:51.314 --> 41:53.719
I knew you'd come for me.

41:55.399 --> 41:57.240
I've been waiting for years.

41:58.879 --> 42:01.000
Have you come for me, too?

42:05.719 --> 42:09.400
I used to see it in people's
faces when they looked at me.

42:09.435 --> 42:11.765
They knew!

42:11.800 --> 42:14.200
I tried to hide, but...

42:14.235 --> 42:16.120
they knew.

42:19.519 --> 42:21.919
I haven't been outside for so long.

42:22.999 --> 42:26.684
Edwin... Little bitch.
You're all the same!

42:26.719 --> 42:29.964
You'll blame me, make me the bad
one! Edwin, put the knife down.

42:29.999 --> 42:33.799
I've wasted my life for you. We won't
tell anyone, no-one else will know.

42:33.834 --> 42:38.200
Stay calm. I won't say a word. You'll
never see me again. I promise.

42:38.235 --> 42:39.724
I know.

42:39.759 --> 42:41.440

It's what you want, isn't it?

42:49.839 --> 42:51.079
Got him!

42:52.519 --> 42:56.599
Got the knife. Are we OK?...
ARE WE OK?! Yeah, yeah, we're OK.

43:00.519 --> 43:02.200
I've got the knife, Edwin.

43:05.199 --> 43:06.764
You were so close.

43:06.799 --> 43:10.399
You were going for her, weren't
you? Just like with Lizzie.

43:11.680 --> 43:13.279
I've got the knife, Edwin.

43:13.314 --> 43:14.897
You were so close.

43:14.932 --> 43:16.480
As close as I am now.

43:17.719 --> 43:20.919
Owen had the knife.
He wanted to kill him.

43:22.800 --> 43:24.964
Why should you get away with it?

43:24.999 --> 43:29.319
Owen. You said you were sorry, that you
didn't want to hurt her, but you didn't stop.

43:29.354 --> 43:33.120
Owen! What if I didn't stop?
Would I be sorry? Owen, NO!

43:35.640 --> 43:37.279
I don't know.

43:46.599 --> 43:48.840
Go and deal with Bernie!

43:52.639 --> 43:56.719
No-one died. You stopped it from
happening. You got here in time!

43:56.754 --> 43:58.119
I knew you'd come for me. Oh!

44:10.639 --> 44:12.799
He's arresting!

Help me.

I was too close, I couldn't stop it!

Oh, God!

44:40.359 --> 44:41.839
I just - I just...

44:46.360 --> 44:49.080
I couldn't stop it.

45:04.079 --> 45:06.444
He wanted to die.

45:06.479 --> 45:08.640
He would have found
a way, no matter what.

45:08.675 --> 45:10.760
I screwed up, I know I did.

45:10.795 --> 45:12.884
But um...

45:12.919 --> 45:15.639
I didn't kill him.
I could of, but I didn't.

45:17.760 --> 45:19.604
No. I did.

45:19.639 --> 45:22.080
Tosh is right.
It could have been anyone.

45:23.839 --> 45:28.279
What about that? The problem with seeing the
future is you can't just sit and look at it.

45:29.839 --> 45:32.419
Got to try and change things.

45:32.454 --> 45:34.999
Make it happen differently.

45:40.480 --> 45:42.799
It's not meant for us.

45:42.834 --> 45:45.257
All these ghosts.

45:45.292 --> 45:47.680
We'd be lost.

Sun's nearly up.

lanto. Secure archives?

46:02.799 --> 46:04.279
Come on.

46:12.760 --> 46:14.919
I killed him.

46:15.960 --> 46:18.039
I've still got blood on my hands.

46:19.599 --> 46:21.079
He killed himself.

Come on, Gwen.

The city'll be awake soon.

46:36.239 --> 46:37.639
All those people.

46:38.679 --> 46:40.419
All that energy.

46:40.454 --> 46:42.159
All those ghosts.

46:43.759 --> 46:45.240
We're surrounded by 'em.

46:46.799 --> 46:48.699
We can't see 'em,

46:48.734 --> 46:50.599
we can't touch 'em...

46:53.039 --> 46:54.720

46:57.000 --> 46:59.680
A million shadows of human emotion.

47:25.840 --> 47:28.559
What's happening?
Internal power drain.

47:32.319 --> 47:35.924
Who the hell is it? It's wrong. It's
beyond wrong. It shouldn't be here.

47:35.959 --> 47:40.120
We have found parts of a Cyber conversion

You execute her.
