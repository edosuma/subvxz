00:01.002 --> 00:06.007
Those lacking imagination
take refuge in reality

00:07.926 --> 00:12.932
if non-thought contaminates thought

00:22.023 --> 00:27.028
it was the best time we ever had

01:13.908 --> 01:17.746
Not our experiences

01:19.497 --> 01:21.166
but the silent tenacity

01:21.249 --> 01:22.667
we affront them with.

01:39.934 --> 01:43.354
Is it possible to produce a concept

01:44.564 --> 01:46.357
about Africa?

02:24.270 --> 02:27.273
Solzhenitsyn's novel has a subtitle.

02:30.318 --> 02:32.946
No need to Google it.

02:34.072 --> 02:36.574
Solzhenitsyn found it all alone.

02:45.500 --> 02:48.920
"Experiment in literary investigation".

02:56.928 --> 02:58.930
What does it do?

02:59.472 --> 03:01.182
I don't understand.

03:01.307 --> 03:04.269
The thumb. What does it do?

03:08.147 --> 03:10.608
What did it do before?

03:13.778 --> 03:15.822
<i>So it's Little Thumb.</i>

03:15.947 --> 03:18.283
That's one way of putting it.

03:20.702 --> 03:23.037
And to mark the trail?

03:23.162 --> 03:24.873
Pebbles.

03:27.876 --> 03:30.044
Where is the ogre?

04:10.919 --> 04:13.046
See this?

04:13.838 --> 04:17.216
"Experiment in literary investigation".

04:23.181 --> 04:25.683
Exam time.

04:26.434 --> 04:29.187
The Ogre takes us by the hand.

04:33.608 --> 04:34.901
All of us.

04:35.234 --> 04:38.738
In 1933, a Russian, Zworykin,

04:39.197 --> 04:41.199
invented television.

04:41.574 --> 04:44.202
Does 1933 ring a bell?

04:45.411 --> 04:48.373
Hitler was elected democratically.

04:49.123 --> 04:50.208
I doubt that.

04:50.750 --> 04:52.919
Everything Hitler said,

04:53.378 --> 04:54.712
he accomplished.

04:55.630 --> 04:58.967
Not the first time
someone conquered by arms

04:59.092 --> 05:02.136
manages to conquer his
conqueror politically.

05:03.096 --> 05:04.639
For example,

05:05.473 --> 05:07.809
armies of the Revolution

05:08.768 --> 05:11.270
were conquered.

05:12.063 --> 05:14.482
But they carried throughout all Europe

05:14.941 --> 05:16.985
the idea of a Republic.

05:17.819 --> 05:20.822
Alas, in Potsdam...

05:21.155 --> 05:22.573
the allies declared:

05:22.740 --> 05:26.619
We will wage peace as we waged war.

05:28.454 --> 05:30.456
What do we see now?

05:42.802 --> 05:45.596
<i>The State is given absolute
power. 1945, Jacques Ellul</i>

05:50.601 --> 05:52.520
<i>He saw it all coming.</i>

05:53.104 --> 05:54.605
<i>Almost.</i>

05:56.858 --> 05:58.151
<i>Atomic power.</i>

06:00.611 --> 06:01.654
<i>GMOsâ€œ...</i>

06:04.157 --> 06:06.200
<i>Advertizing. The State takes all.</i>

06:08.619 --> 06:09.787
<i>Nanotechnologies.</i>

06:12.832 --> 06:16.002
<i>Terrorism. This is
Hitler's second victory.</i>

06:19.797 --> 06:22.633
We've got used to the
State doing everything

06:23.551 --> 06:26.179
and whenever something goes wrong,

06:26.512 --> 06:29.348
<i>we blame the State. Unemployment.</i>

06:30.016 --> 06:32.518
We ask it to take the
entire nation's life

06:33.811 --> 06:35.688
as its responsibility.

06:51.162 --> 06:53.164
Reacting implies

06:53.414 --> 06:56.334
that we react against economic policy,

06:58.044 --> 07:00.213
against the police,

07:00.338 --> 07:02.340
against welfare.

07:03.674 --> 07:08.721
We see the entire nation
rise up against us.

07:10.056 --> 07:13.768
In fact, Hitler did not invent a thing.

07:18.356 --> 07:19.398
A long tradition

07:19.565 --> 07:22.443
led up to this crisis.

07:22.902 --> 07:24.862
Machiavelli, Richelieu,

07:26.739 --> 07:28.199
Bismarck.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.875
And the Terror, Alain?

07:39.085 --> 07:43.047
In '93, during the Terror,

07:43.422 --> 07:47.426
the Convention produced: the Civil Code,

07:48.219 --> 07:50.721
the new calendar,

07:50.888 --> 07:52.640
the decimal system,

07:53.766 --> 07:56.435
Hitler's victory, children.

07:56.894 --> 07:58.729
The manufacturing of steel,

07:59.897 --> 08:03.067
government accounting,

08:03.151 --> 08:05.111
the Music Conservatory.

08:11.492 --> 08:14.620
Sir, is it possible to produce a concept

08:15.329 --> 08:16.831
about Africa?

08:54.202 --> 08:57.496
The law that denies its
own violence, cheats.

08:58.164 --> 09:02.793
The law that denies what turns
it into a state apparatus, cheats.

09:02.960 --> 09:07.298
The law which deems itself
self-legitimatizing, cheats twice.

09:07.965 --> 09:12.845
I think that in primitive
societies, this was not the case.

09:13.137 --> 09:14.013
And during war?

09:14.680 --> 09:19.185
It is a war, but of
society against State.

09:25.233 --> 09:26.484
I don't care.

10:39.307 --> 10:41.559
I am at your command.

11:02.788 --> 11:06.083
The end lingers on, I
must live through it.

11:06.250 --> 11:07.960
And it isn't easy.

11:22.141 --> 11:23.351
The mouth closes...

11:24.101 --> 11:26.604
Time to go straight ahead now.

11:29.106 --> 11:30.649
I made the image.

11:42.536 --> 11:44.330
What is going on?

11:49.668 --> 11:51.379
End of this world?

11:53.172 --> 11:55.341
Advent of another world?

11:56.842 --> 11:59.011
So what happens

11:59.136 --> 12:03.516
in that which seems
to have no clear name.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.894
We've come to say goodbye.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.688
Leaving for the Americas?

12:14.068 --> 12:15.486
Got some cheap junk?

12:15.653 --> 12:17.321
Just a little philo.

12:18.989 --> 12:21.325
You'll tell them what philosophy is.

12:25.663 --> 12:26.997
Philosophy is a being,

12:28.082 --> 12:29.375
the heart of it

12:30.835 --> 12:32.753
being the question of its being

12:33.003 --> 12:36.424
insofar as this being posits
a being other than itself.

12:40.177 --> 12:43.681
You think that in Europe
happiness is not a new idea?

12:43.889 --> 12:44.849
I'm into Africa.

12:47.893 --> 12:49.353
Good luck!

12:57.027 --> 12:58.529
Hello again.

12:58.612 --> 13:00.573
I'll call the police.

13:01.240 --> 13:02.533
He's sick.

13:03.075 --> 13:04.577
Just one question.

13:05.536 --> 13:08.038
It's vacation. We start
again in September.

13:12.710 --> 13:14.211
Two questions.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.722
Is society

13:24.805 --> 13:27.308
willing to accept murder

13:27.808 --> 13:29.727
as a means to fight unemployment?

13:31.270 --> 13:33.063
Second question.

13:35.774 --> 13:38.110
What is the difference...

13:38.235 --> 13:40.821
between an idea and a metaphor?

13:43.741 --> 13:45.951
Ask Athenians on the tram.

13:54.960 --> 13:58.464
Interior experience is now forbidden

13:59.965 --> 14:02.843
by society in general

14:03.511 --> 14:06.639
and spectacle in particular.

14:07.640 --> 14:10.100
You mentioned murder.

14:10.809 --> 14:13.687
What they call images

14:14.772 --> 14:18.150
are becoming the murder of the present.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.158
The present is a strange beast.

14:28.661 --> 14:30.621
I don't care.

14:54.645 --> 14:56.689
Take truth.

14:57.648 --> 15:00.317
Plato says that beauty

15:00.693 --> 15:02.861
is the splendor of truth.

15:03.529 --> 15:05.573
Now there's an idea.

15:06.323 --> 15:09.410
A metaphor of truth...

15:10.828 --> 15:12.162
Look.

15:13.539 --> 15:15.499
A child playing dice.

15:50.534 --> 15:52.453
I am at your command.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.887
A girl or a woman?

16:14.224 --> 16:16.101
You'll see.

16:19.938 --> 16:23.942
I've never managed to make
it through just as it changes.

16:34.244 --> 16:36.622
When you first met him...

16:38.749 --> 16:40.250
where was it?

16:40.959 --> 16:42.294
In Kinshasa.

16:43.754 --> 16:47.800
At a bend in the river.

17:01.438 --> 17:03.649
That reminds me of something.

17:09.363 --> 17:10.948
The title of...

17:11.448 --> 17:12.657
a book.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.290
Nobel Prize in Literature.

17:20.665 --> 17:23.502
Never been a Nobel for painting.

17:23.711 --> 17:25.838
Or music.

17:44.523 --> 17:47.192
What bank did he work at?

17:48.068 --> 17:49.695
Alas.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.891
You must not stay here...

18:42.581 --> 18:45.542
It's dangerous.

18:46.543 --> 18:47.753
I am not afraid.

18:52.633 --> 18:56.637
Today, everyone is afraid.

19:03.769 --> 19:06.396
Apache Indians of the Chikawa tribe,

19:06.563 --> 19:09.566
call the world: the forest.

19:10.484 --> 19:12.903
This morning is a dream.

19:12.986 --> 19:16.740
Each person must think that
the other is the dreamer.

19:17.282 --> 19:19.451
A woman can do no harm.

19:19.576 --> 19:23.163
She can annoy you, she
can kill you, no more.

19:25.082 --> 19:27.793
You all disgust me with your happiness.

19:27.918 --> 19:31.088
This life we must love at any cost...

19:31.255 --> 19:33.757
I am here for something else.

19:33.924 --> 19:36.760
I am here to tell you no.

19:36.844 --> 19:38.303
And to die.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.369
I have to go too.

20:44.912 --> 20:46.872
Hurry UP!

20:50.083 --> 20:52.419
You can't call this equality.

20:53.170 --> 20:56.757
<i>Rodin's sculpture, The
Thinker... you know it?</i>

21:05.432 --> 21:07.184
I don't know.

21:07.601 --> 21:09.436
The image of equality.

21:22.115 --> 21:25.035
A function, a position.

21:25.619 --> 21:30.248
An instant belonging to
everyone in time and space,

21:30.707 --> 21:31.959
the only one,

21:32.084 --> 21:34.628
the nuts and bolts of equality.

21:35.253 --> 21:39.091
Because everyone's thoughts
in this situation...

21:39.216 --> 21:42.636
thought regains its place in poop.

21:47.724 --> 21:50.060
You're young.

21:51.061 --> 21:54.064
At the height of your
beauty and strength.

21:58.735 --> 22:00.487
I am going to die.

22:06.243 --> 22:08.578
I do not want to leave you.

22:09.454 --> 22:11.790
I do not want to take you back.

22:13.166 --> 22:14.918
I want nothing.

22:18.171 --> 22:20.757
I am down on my knees, defeated.

22:32.477 --> 22:34.479
We speak about nothing.

22:35.981 --> 22:39.359
You hurt me and offended me.

22:40.193 --> 22:42.612
I'd told you so, as well.

22:43.655 --> 22:45.824
We no longer love each other,

22:47.284 --> 22:49.619
never loved each other.

22:54.624 --> 22:57.627
In myths recounting
the birth of the hero,

23:02.132 --> 23:04.468
being submerged in water

23:05.469 --> 23:08.305
is similar to representations of birth

23:08.388 --> 23:10.515
manifest in dreams.

23:51.181 --> 23:53.183
I can't hear a thing.

23:58.855 --> 24:00.440
He says he's dying.

24:14.955 --> 24:16.581
So let him die.

24:37.602 --> 24:38.812
There has existed

24:39.813 --> 24:40.897
for 20 or 30 years now

24:40.981 --> 24:43.233
a universal declaration
of animal rights.

24:45.152 --> 24:47.279
It contains ten articles.

24:47.612 --> 24:50.282
It was drafted 200 years after 1789.

25:17.309 --> 25:18.852
No one could think

25:20.312 --> 25:21.146
freely

25:21.646 --> 25:23.982
if his eyes were locked

25:24.524 --> 25:25.942
in another's gaze.

25:27.819 --> 25:30.155
As soon as gazes lock,

25:30.488 --> 25:33.200
there are no longer exactly two of us.

25:33.950 --> 25:36.161
Staying alone becomes hard.

27:14.467 --> 27:16.386
It is not animals who are blind.

27:16.469 --> 27:19.472
Man, blinded by conscience,

27:19.597 --> 27:21.766
is incapable of seeing the world.

27:24.144 --> 27:27.272
What is outside, wrote Rilke,

27:27.605 --> 27:30.483
can be known only via an animal's gaze.

27:32.819 --> 27:34.821
And Darwin, citing Buff on,

27:35.280 --> 27:38.658
maintains that the dog is
the only living creature

27:38.783 --> 27:41.661
that loves you more
than it loves itself.

27:47.417 --> 27:49.461
The shadow of God.

27:50.837 --> 27:54.007
Is it not for a woman who loves her man?

27:54.257 --> 27:58.511
Everyone can stop God from
existing, but no one does.

27:58.845 --> 27:59.679
I'm sorry.

28:08.772 --> 28:12.275
Nothing was even broached
at that point in the story.

28:14.778 --> 28:17.530
The reason for their being together

28:17.655 --> 28:21.826
seemed - although they
claim the opposite -

28:22.702 --> 28:25.997
to each of them devoid of any future.

28:29.793 --> 28:31.461
They enter a murky realm.

28:40.887 --> 28:41.971
Look!

28:43.473 --> 28:45.725
Go on, get out!

28:45.975 --> 28:47.352
He seems nice.

28:52.315 --> 28:54.359
It'll do us good.

28:54.484 --> 28:57.404
<i>Beat u, fleabag, get out...</i>

29:41.197 --> 29:43.867
Have you been living here long?

29:46.536 --> 29:49.372
Why "long"? "Do you
live here" is enough.

30:18.943 --> 30:22.906
If being face to face invents language

30:57.857 --> 30:59.984
Right and left were inverted

31:03.112 --> 31:06.032
but not the top and bottom.

31:06.824 --> 31:08.451
Why?

31:33.393 --> 31:36.729
When he entered the gas chamber,

31:37.230 --> 31:39.816
a child asked

31:40.066 --> 31:43.069
"Why" to his mother.

31:44.153 --> 31:46.864
An SS officer shouted

31:50.994 --> 31:52.870
No whys!

31:56.666 --> 32:01.879
I remember studying the
Laurent-Schwarz-Dirac curve.

32:03.673 --> 32:08.553
Infinite in every point
except for one which is zero.

32:12.181 --> 32:13.933
Or the contrary.

32:15.101 --> 32:17.103
The two greatest inventions,

32:17.395 --> 32:19.355
infinity and zero.

32:21.232 --> 32:22.900
No.

32:25.570 --> 32:26.904
Sex

32:27.071 --> 32:28.364
and death.

32:39.208 --> 32:43.379
Only free beings can be
strangers to each other.

32:44.922 --> 32:47.091
They have a shared freedom,

32:48.468 --> 32:50.887
but this is what separates them.

33:16.663 --> 33:19.248
Four years ago, you stabbed me.

33:19.832 --> 33:21.751
You've forgotten.

33:26.255 --> 33:28.925
Do something so I can speak to you.

33:31.969 --> 33:33.513
What must I do?

33:37.767 --> 33:40.269
Persuade me that you hear me.

33:44.649 --> 33:49.195
I will barely say a word. I am
looking for poverty in language.

34:01.624 --> 34:03.000
Where the hell are you going?

34:03.167 --> 34:05.044
I'll show you.

34:06.003 --> 34:09.297
He could not make us...

34:10.882 --> 34:12.719
humble.

34:15.138 --> 34:16.222
Who?

34:17.681 --> 34:19.684
Or could not.

34:19.809 --> 34:21.060
Or would not.

34:22.145 --> 34:25.231
So he made us...

34:25.356 --> 34:26.815
humiliated.

34:28.735 --> 34:30.319
Who?

34:30.402 --> 34:31.487
God.

34:38.494 --> 34:39.871
It's here.

34:41.706 --> 34:44.708
<i>We're going to see Frankenstein.</i>

34:46.002 --> 34:47.587
We'll be back.

35:25.792 --> 35:27.627
In your circus

35:28.211 --> 35:29.128
of forests,

35:30.129 --> 35:31.881
of hills,

35:32.131 --> 35:33.591
of valleys

35:34.425 --> 35:36.052
pale death

35:36.719 --> 35:38.888
blended the dark battalions.

36:14.173 --> 36:16.050
I am at your command.

36:28.896 --> 36:30.565
Where are you going?

36:31.190 --> 36:32.567
Where I must.

36:40.408 --> 36:42.076
In Kinshasa,

36:42.201 --> 36:45.037
a journalist told me a story

36:46.163 --> 36:47.832
about Mao Tse-Tung.

36:48.958 --> 36:52.920
He was asked about the
influence of the '89 revolution.

36:57.967 --> 37:00.261
He said it's too soon to know.

37:03.014 --> 37:05.766
You know, in Russian,
kamera means prison.

37:08.561 --> 37:13.065
You know, Russian cigarettes
are healthier than American ones.

37:14.275 --> 37:15.860
Why is that?

37:17.862 --> 37:20.615
Because they contain almost no tobacco.

37:21.324 --> 37:23.993
Russia will never be part of Europe.

37:24.785 --> 37:29.206
If Russians become Europeans,
they'll never be Russian again.

37:31.459 --> 37:35.254
I've never made it through.
Not slowing down on green.

37:36.631 --> 37:38.966
Use the formula from yesteryear.

37:58.361 --> 38:00.196
Why are you here?

38:01.739 --> 38:03.908
Because there are no grownups.

38:05.326 --> 38:07.578
In Africa you were coming out of what?

38:07.703 --> 38:09.288
The silence.

38:11.707 --> 38:13.376
There are tons of sounds.

38:13.751 --> 38:15.544
There is war.

38:17.421 --> 38:18.214
There are animals.

38:20.925 --> 38:23.219
The silence arrives, then...

38:24.595 --> 38:25.763
another country.

38:27.181 --> 38:30.101
They're at the door. Speaking to you.

38:30.226 --> 38:32.812
With language, something's happening.

38:38.859 --> 38:42.238
Something awkward about
our relation to the world.

38:43.447 --> 38:46.367
It acts against pure freedom.

38:51.122 --> 38:52.623
I'm speaking,

38:53.082 --> 38:54.458
subject.

38:54.750 --> 38:56.669
I must not stay here.

38:59.547 --> 39:01.424
I'm listening...

39:01.549 --> 39:02.717
object.

39:18.107 --> 39:20.067
You've given up everything.

39:21.110 --> 39:23.070
Take it one step further.

39:23.988 --> 39:26.449
Give up freedom itself

39:26.699 --> 39:29.243
and everything will be returned to you.

39:33.247 --> 39:35.332
We need to get an interpreter.

39:35.458 --> 39:37.334
Why do you say that?

39:38.335 --> 39:39.962
Soon,

39:40.296 --> 39:42.882
everyone will need an interpreter.

39:43.090 --> 39:46.844
To understand the words
coming from their own mouths.

40:19.502 --> 40:21.045
What does your husband do?

40:22.880 --> 40:24.632
He organizes events.

40:26.842 --> 40:28.469
He's just an individual.

40:41.482 --> 40:43.317
Not my turn to answer.

40:45.528 --> 40:47.446
You know better than me.

40:55.746 --> 40:57.414
What did you mean

40:58.207 --> 41:00.167
when you declared:

41:01.794 --> 41:02.920
"I am at your command"?

41:12.680 --> 41:14.807
None of that matters anymore.

41:20.813 --> 41:24.024
What's at stake is
infinitely more serious.

41:28.445 --> 41:31.365
Not simple thoughts and simple glances.

41:59.852 --> 42:01.770
Summer already

42:02.938 --> 42:05.232
and you still haven't answered.

42:05.649 --> 42:07.735
There was my voice.

42:11.113 --> 42:14.909
I would like to call
proletarian the king of things.

42:16.577 --> 42:18.495
A matter of harmony, then.

42:19.121 --> 42:20.581
About what?

42:23.459 --> 42:25.753
To let the other love.

42:28.964 --> 42:31.091
Do you still take pictures?

42:33.052 --> 42:35.763
Showing a forest, easy.

42:36.597 --> 42:40.100
But showing a room
with a forest nearby...

42:43.854 --> 42:46.523
So the years passed..

42:49.318 --> 42:52.112
You all disgust me

42:52.488 --> 42:54.198
with your happiness.

42:55.532 --> 42:56.367
Yes,

42:57.326 --> 42:59.119
I am here to say no.

43:01.038 --> 43:03.165
This morning is a dream.

43:04.375 --> 43:06.460
Each thinks the other is dreaming.

43:10.005 --> 43:12.424
A woman can do no harm.

43:13.300 --> 43:14.843
She can annoy.

43:15.094 --> 43:16.679
She can kill.

43:17.346 --> 43:18.305
No more.

43:25.104 --> 43:27.314
When I was a kid, we played Indians.

43:28.190 --> 43:30.985
Apaches were my favorite.

43:32.444 --> 43:36.240
Their word for the world is: the forest.

44:21.535 --> 44:23.037
Hurry, I don't want to wait.

44:39.178 --> 44:42.890
I talk about equality and
each time you talk about poop.

44:42.973 --> 44:46.226
Because that's where we're all equal.

44:46.935 --> 44:49.021
I know what you're looking at.

44:50.189 --> 44:52.649
Yes, a shame, no more forest.

44:55.027 --> 44:56.737
No more war, we said.

45:59.174 --> 46:01.885
Pray to God that all will be forgiven.

46:08.475 --> 46:10.978
Go away now.

46:11.812 --> 46:13.981
Try to smile as you leave.

47:23.300 --> 47:24.760
Avoid...

47:25.594 --> 47:27.304
shattered memories.

47:32.100 --> 47:35.062
The police are coming. You must leave.

47:44.655 --> 47:45.489
Words.

47:47.366 --> 47:49.701
I don't want to hear about them.

48:28.824 --> 48:30.826
No nudity in nature.

48:32.452 --> 48:36.039
Animals are not naked
because they are naked.

48:47.217 --> 48:50.137
Now that I have seen war,

48:51.221 --> 48:53.265
I know that if it ended,

48:54.641 --> 48:56.393
everyone would ask:

48:58.020 --> 49:00.314
what do we do with the bodies?

49:01.732 --> 49:04.318
Perhaps only for them is the war over.

49:07.154 --> 49:11.033
A philosopher is worried
by others' existence,

49:11.450 --> 49:15.704
perceiving the
revolutionary force of signs.

50:29.277 --> 50:30.737
The water spoke to him

50:30.904 --> 50:33.115
in a deep, serious voice.

50:34.866 --> 50:37.577
So Roxy began to think.

50:38.829 --> 50:40.956
It is trying to talk to me,

50:41.498 --> 50:44.876
as it has always tried to
speak to people over the ages.

50:46.169 --> 50:49.548
Conversing with itself when
there was no one to listen.

50:50.257 --> 50:52.092
But trying,

50:52.259 --> 50:56.096
always trying to communicate
its news to others.

50:58.557 --> 51:02.477
Some of them learned a
certain truth from the river.

51:22.080 --> 51:25.584
The river is still
asleep in a dreamy fog.

51:26.710 --> 51:29.880
We see it no better than it sees itself.

51:30.714 --> 51:33.049
Here is already the river.

51:33.175 --> 51:36.178
But there, no more can be seen.

51:37.012 --> 51:39.306
All we see is the abyss.

51:40.223 --> 51:42.976
A fog that stops us from seeing further.

51:45.520 --> 51:47.814
At that spot on the canvas,

51:48.523 --> 51:51.735
paint not what we see,
for we see nothing,

51:53.111 --> 51:55.155
nor what we cannot see,

51:55.822 --> 51:58.366
for we must paint only what we see.

51:58.909 --> 52:01.453
But paint that we don't see.

52:03.330 --> 52:04.297
Claude Monet.

52:40.492 --> 52:43.161
I hate characters.

52:47.916 --> 52:49.876
Ever since birth,

52:50.585 --> 52:52.546
we're mistaken for another.

53:03.473 --> 53:04.975
We push him,

53:07.978 --> 53:09.813
we pull him...

53:18.905 --> 53:21.491
We force him to get in character.

53:26.413 --> 53:29.040
To live or to tell.

53:31.418 --> 53:32.711
Yes.

53:36.089 --> 53:38.174
We say there's no choice.

54:01.031 --> 54:03.158
Look in the mirror.

54:03.491 --> 54:04.951
There are both of them.

54:07.495 --> 54:09.289
You mean...

54:09.456 --> 54:10.790
the four of them.

54:15.837 --> 54:17.047
In fact

54:21.468 --> 54:24.554
a fact does not
translate what we've done,

54:27.766 --> 54:29.559
but what we haven't done.

54:32.646 --> 54:34.606
We will have children.

54:37.067 --> 54:37.984
Not yet.

54:41.738 --> 54:43.865
A dog, if you want.

55:02.676 --> 55:07.055
Imagine you're still a little boy.

55:09.015 --> 55:11.601
We looked at cloud shapes.

55:12.727 --> 55:13.645
As a girl,

55:15.063 --> 55:17.232
I saw dogs all over.

55:18.316 --> 55:21.319
In the blue or the white?

55:23.863 --> 55:26.449
We are together, both of them.

55:28.410 --> 55:30.537
We will need children.

55:31.955 --> 55:33.581
Not sure.

55:34.958 --> 55:36.876
A dog, yes!

55:37.752 --> 55:40.046
This is the story dogs tell.

55:40.922 --> 55:43.091
While the fire burns in the hearth,

55:44.551 --> 55:46.845
and the north wind blows,

55:47.887 --> 55:50.432
the family, then,

55:51.141 --> 55:53.393
sits around the fire.

55:54.394 --> 55:57.063
Puppies listen but do not say a word.

55:57.313 --> 55:59.983
And, when the story is over,

56:02.068 --> 56:03.737
they ask many questions.

56:05.321 --> 56:06.906
What is man?

56:11.244 --> 56:12.746
What is a city?

56:17.125 --> 56:19.002
What is war?

56:48.114 --> 56:50.408
I can know

56:51.284 --> 56:54.204
what someone else thinks,

56:56.456 --> 56:58.333
but not what I think.

57:07.467 --> 57:09.385
Do something

57:10.303 --> 57:12.472
so I can speak.

57:17.894 --> 57:20.730
I can know what someone else thinks,

57:22.398 --> 57:24.234
but not what I think.

57:24.776 --> 57:26.569
Do something

57:27.821 --> 57:29.948
so that I can speak.

57:47.799 --> 57:51.427
It is precisely because this gentleness

57:51.886 --> 57:55.682
was necessary to give birth to pain

57:59.227 --> 58:01.187
and comes back, moreover,

58:01.354 --> 58:03.356
to soothe it at times...

58:05.233 --> 58:08.194
that men can be sincere

58:08.987 --> 58:10.697
with others

58:12.031 --> 58:13.867
and even with themselves,

58:17.203 --> 58:19.539
when they glory in

58:19.831 --> 58:24.252
a woman's kindness toward them.

58:30.717 --> 58:34.637
At the heart of their liaison
circulates, constantly,

58:36.306 --> 58:37.891
secretly,

58:39.142 --> 58:41.227
unavowed to others,

58:44.105 --> 58:48.985
or unwittingly revealed by
questions, investigations,

58:56.743 --> 58:59.954
a painful concern.

59:05.668 --> 59:10.506
But this could not have arisen
without the previous gentleness.

59:33.988 --> 59:36.282
They always want to be on time.

59:36.866 --> 59:38.785
Where does that come from?

59:41.204 --> 59:43.289
They want to be first.

59:44.290 --> 59:45.875
A German mathematician...

59:46.000 --> 59:47.377
Another German!

59:47.502 --> 59:50.004
Concerning prime numbers,

59:50.129 --> 59:52.799
Riemann arrived atalandscape

59:53.341 --> 59:56.803
in which each point becomes music.

59:58.471 --> 01:00:01.391
A line of zeros along the sea.

01:01:04.203 --> 01:01:07.040
One can imagine that
Frankenstein was born here.

01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:19.218
One can imagine.

01:01:52.543 --> 01:01:58.133
In 1816, Lord Byron and
Shelley, chased from England,

01:01:59.425 --> 01:02:02.678
sought shelter by Lake Geneva

01:02:02.804 --> 01:02:07.935
with Mary Shelley who began
to write a horror tale.

01:04:12.725 --> 01:04:14.685
Nothing tragic about this story.

01:04:16.854 --> 01:04:19.065
Not the laughter of giants,

01:04:19.857 --> 01:04:22.109
no indifferent detail

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:25.488
recounts their pathetic love.

01:04:34.455 --> 01:04:36.874
You are in bed, Professor.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.126
You are asleep...

01:04:40.753 --> 01:04:42.004
except...

01:04:42.755 --> 01:04:44.799
we are not your dream.

01:04:47.635 --> 01:04:48.678
You don't know?

01:04:51.639 --> 01:04:53.975
No, I don't know.

01:04:57.812 --> 01:04:59.689
I don't believe you.

01:05:04.902 --> 01:05:07.029
I'm coming down below.

01:05:07.822 --> 01:05:10.366
Yes, in depth.

01:05:12.952 --> 01:05:15.246
I think you have to...

01:05:15.746 --> 01:05:17.039
start down below...

01:05:22.003 --> 01:05:23.421
and then surface.

01:05:23.546 --> 01:05:27.174
Two questions, a big
one and a small one.

01:05:30.303 --> 01:05:34.765
What's difficult is to
fit flatness into depth.

01:05:34.890 --> 01:05:36.684
Suffering.

01:05:39.645 --> 01:05:41.647
The other world.

01:06:01.709 --> 01:06:03.210
It's him.

01:06:04.545 --> 01:06:05.671
Use a deep voice.

01:06:05.755 --> 01:06:06.464
My word.

01:06:07.798 --> 01:06:11.177
You what do here?

01:06:11.302 --> 01:06:13.179
Me very upset!

01:06:58.099 --> 01:06:59.600
Outside!

01:07:41.267 --> 01:07:43.310
He seems depressed.

01:07:51.694 --> 01:07:54.071
He's dreaming of the Marquesas Islands.
