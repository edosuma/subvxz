00:33.405 --> 00:36.450
Ah, you're a godsend, Judy.

00:36.450 --> 00:38.577
I thought yesterday
was your last day.

00:38.577 --> 00:40.495
Apparently not.

01:02.768 --> 01:04.519
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:04.519 --> 01:06.813
I wanted to squeeze one more in.

01:06.813 --> 01:08.482
You should have
your head checked.

01:08.482 --> 01:10.400
Introduce me.

01:10.400 --> 01:14.821
Your Honor, a notice of
appearance for my co-counselor.

01:20.452 --> 01:21.661
Judy Wood.

01:21.661 --> 01:23.455
The court so notes.

01:23.455 --> 01:25.457
You at least want to know
what the prosecution said

01:25.457 --> 01:26.708
during their opening statement?

01:26.708 --> 01:28.377
Nope.

01:28.377 --> 01:30.462
I hope you know
what you're doing.

01:31.546 --> 01:34.049
You're gonna be fine.

01:34.049 --> 01:36.468
May it please the court.

01:38.762 --> 01:41.973
Ladies and gentlemen,
this case,

01:41.973 --> 01:45.894
above all other things,
this case is about love.

01:45.894 --> 01:47.479
Oh, sweet Jesus.

01:47.479 --> 01:48.814
Actually about grand theft auto.

01:48.814 --> 01:52.025
It will be my job
to tell you about Lonan.

01:52.025 --> 01:54.903
Growing up fatherless
with an alcoholic mother,

01:54.903 --> 01:58.532
working two jobs,
so he could put his two sisters

01:58.532 --> 02:00.492
and brother through college.

02:00.492 --> 02:03.537
Now thanks to Lonan's
generosity and selflessness,

02:03.537 --> 02:06.623
his brother, Mohan,
is an engineer,

02:06.623 --> 02:08.125
and his sister, Ela,
is a teacher,

02:08.125 --> 02:11.837
and the youngest, Nashota,
is pre-med.

02:11.837 --> 02:13.964
Now, Lonan will tell you
himself,

02:13.964 --> 02:15.632
so that he could
have a life,

02:15.632 --> 02:18.427
a life like he'd given
his siblings,

02:18.427 --> 02:20.429
he made one simple mistake.

02:20.429 --> 02:23.515
All right. Your Honor,
we'd like a side bar.

02:23.515 --> 02:26.852
Did you just interrupt
defense's opening statement?

02:26.852 --> 02:29.521
I don't think she's gonna mind.

02:29.521 --> 02:32.524
We've got a pretty good
plea deal lined up.

02:32.524 --> 02:34.484
Gabriella, I know
it's not ideal,

02:34.484 --> 02:36.695
but you'll see your son
before he leaves for college.

02:36.695 --> 02:38.905
Six years is three-and-change
if you don't screw it up.

02:38.905 --> 02:41.116
And I know you won't do that
to your family.

02:41.116 --> 02:43.702
Good, good, good.

02:43.702 --> 02:45.203
You don't know when to quit.

02:45.203 --> 02:47.080
And don't even think about
giving Zapato to Roger.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.707
It's his third strike,

02:48.707 --> 02:50.125
and Roger couldn't acquit
the Dalai Lama.

02:50.125 --> 02:51.960
What did I say to you
on your first day?

02:51.960 --> 02:54.838
I know, but it's
my last day, so...

02:54.838 --> 02:57.090
All right, I gotta go.

02:57.090 --> 02:58.675
Good seeing you.

02:58.675 --> 03:00.052
Mmm!

03:00.052 --> 03:01.636
Good talk!

03:02.721 --> 03:05.015
See you around, kiddo.

03:09.186 --> 03:11.563
- Hey.
- Hey, sweetie.

03:13.565 --> 03:14.983
That's cute.

03:14.983 --> 03:16.651
They spelled California wrong.

03:16.651 --> 03:18.695
Cali-fron-ia?

03:18.695 --> 03:20.739
Well, onwards and upwards,
right?

03:20.739 --> 03:22.407
- Right.
- All right, hold on.

03:24.201 --> 03:26.787
- You ready to do this?
- Yes.

03:26.787 --> 03:28.914
Limbs in? All right.

03:28.914 --> 03:31.583
- I'm so excited.
- You're excited?

03:31.583 --> 03:33.001
I like your spirit.

03:48.183 --> 03:50.102
Hey, TTNBTT.

03:50.102 --> 03:51.895
It doesn't matter.

03:53.021 --> 03:55.190
TTNBTT.

03:55.190 --> 03:57.818
If we drive all night,
I'm gonna throw up.

03:57.818 --> 04:01.655
If we don't drive all night,
your father's gonna divorce me.

04:01.655 --> 04:03.490
Again.

04:03.490 --> 04:05.492
I'm pretty sure
you can't get divorced

04:05.492 --> 04:07.119
if you're already divorced.

04:09.579 --> 04:12.165
Why are we doing this again?

04:12.165 --> 04:14.584
Your father
gets shared custody.

04:14.584 --> 04:17.587
So LA, here we come.

04:38.608 --> 04:40.193
TTNBTT.

04:40.193 --> 04:43.655
Do you have any idea
where we're going?

04:43.655 --> 04:45.115
At all?

05:15.896 --> 05:17.856
Lock the door.

05:32.662 --> 05:34.873
Hi.

05:34.915 --> 05:36.208
I'm Judy Wood.

05:38.293 --> 05:42.255
I'm looking for 123 and a half.

05:43.924 --> 05:45.634
That's my kid.

05:45.634 --> 05:47.094
We're new here.

05:52.682 --> 05:55.227
Looks like you found it.

05:55.227 --> 05:57.062
Right.

05:57.062 --> 05:59.731
You need some help, Judy Wood?

05:59.773 --> 06:02.943
Yes, I need help.

06:04.736 --> 06:06.405
Where's my room?

06:06.405 --> 06:08.198
Uh, right.

06:08.198 --> 06:10.909
Well, check this out.

06:10.909 --> 06:12.285
Here we go.

06:12.285 --> 06:14.246
Ta-da!

06:14.246 --> 06:16.081
Just until I get
my first paycheck, all right?

06:16.123 --> 06:17.749
We're not even gonna unpack.

06:17.749 --> 06:20.877
Yes, thank you so much.

06:20.877 --> 06:23.130
I start at
an immigration firm tomorrow.

06:23.130 --> 06:25.424
- Mom!
- We look illegal or something?

06:25.424 --> 06:29.928
No, but I sure should hope
you know a few.

06:29.970 --> 06:33.014
Yeah, our cousins,
brothers, uncles, nephews.

06:33.014 --> 06:34.891
Appreciate your help.

06:34.891 --> 06:37.227
I'll see you
in the neighborhood.

06:48.196 --> 06:51.283
Judy Wood here to see
Ray Hernandez.

06:51.283 --> 06:53.201
Ms. Wood?

06:53.201 --> 06:54.661
Ray Hernandez.

06:55.704 --> 06:56.913
Nice to meet you.

06:56.913 --> 06:58.290
Very nice to meet you too.

06:58.290 --> 07:02.335
So, 36% win rate
as a criminal defender.

07:02.335 --> 07:05.005
You got any prosecutors
in New Mexico?

07:05.005 --> 07:07.215
Different ballgame here, honey.

07:07.215 --> 07:09.801
But your old boss said I'd be
a fool not to snap you up.

07:09.843 --> 07:11.845
So what do you know
about immigration law?

07:11.845 --> 07:15.474
No, wait, don't answer that.
I don't want to suborn perjury.

07:15.474 --> 07:18.268
Welcome to
your new corner office.

07:18.268 --> 07:20.187
And when you start
booking your own clients,

07:20.187 --> 07:21.229
maybe we can reassess.

07:21.229 --> 07:22.856
But in the meantime,

07:22.856 --> 07:25.275
let me introduce you
to your new best friend.

07:28.070 --> 07:29.488
That's the sound
I want to hear,

07:29.488 --> 07:31.198
like the gavel
at the end of a hearing.

07:31.198 --> 07:32.824
We've got to keep
the lights on here,

07:32.824 --> 07:34.701
and everybody pays up front.

07:36.036 --> 07:37.662
Follow me.

07:39.039 --> 07:41.041
I don't have time
to be your mentor,

07:41.041 --> 07:43.919
but real cases
are always the best teacher.

07:45.879 --> 07:47.172
Dealer's choice.

08:43.979 --> 08:45.522
Asefa Ashwari,

08:45.522 --> 08:46.940
national of Afghanistan,

08:46.940 --> 08:48.567
entered on a counterfeit visa...

08:48.567 --> 08:50.152
Hold it right there.

08:50.152 --> 08:53.822
I have just the remedy
for a case like this.

08:56.491 --> 08:58.535
"Voluntary removal."

08:58.535 --> 09:00.078
But she wants to stay.

09:00.078 --> 09:01.538
Well, I want a yacht.

09:01.538 --> 09:03.415
This is a magic pill.

09:03.415 --> 09:06.126
Gives the subject two months
to clear up their affairs,

09:06.126 --> 09:08.336
then they can go back home.

09:08.336 --> 09:13.425
Okay, there might be something
else here that I'm missing,

09:13.425 --> 09:15.927
so maybe I'd like to speak
to Miss Ashwari

09:15.927 --> 09:17.429
before she signs.

09:17.429 --> 09:20.891
Well, Lancaster's beautiful
this time of year.

09:20.891 --> 09:22.434
Just get her signature.

09:34.613 --> 09:36.323
Guess what.

09:36.323 --> 09:39.242
I'm meeting
my first client today.

09:39.242 --> 09:40.869
I want cereal.

09:40.869 --> 09:41.995
Eat.

09:43.246 --> 09:45.332
- Stop it.
- Never.

10:09.398 --> 10:10.482
ID.

12:06.181 --> 12:07.307
Miss Ashwari?

12:09.184 --> 12:11.561
I'm Judy Wood,
your new attorney.

12:11.561 --> 12:14.648
Ray Hernandez
referred your case to me.

12:14.689 --> 12:17.442
He suggests that you opt
for a voluntary removal,

12:17.442 --> 12:20.153
but I have a few questions
about your case

12:20.195 --> 12:21.321
before you do that.

12:23.365 --> 12:27.160
If you accept my services,
I need you to sign this form.

12:30.122 --> 12:31.707
Miss Ashwari?

12:45.721 --> 12:47.514
Mr. King?

12:47.556 --> 12:48.640
Who's your client?

12:48.640 --> 12:50.559
Asefa Ashwari.

12:50.559 --> 12:53.603
I need her A number,
on the Notice of Appearance.

12:59.359 --> 13:00.360
Asefa Ashwari.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.821
Are you aware of her condition?

13:02.821 --> 13:04.364
Your client was medicated

13:04.364 --> 13:06.199
because she was
a danger to herself.

13:06.199 --> 13:08.243
She needs to be unmedicated and
transferred out for treatment.

13:08.243 --> 13:10.412
She is not competent
to assist in her defense.

13:10.412 --> 13:12.831
- Miss...
- Wood.

13:12.831 --> 13:14.458
I take it
you're new to practice.

13:14.458 --> 13:16.209
I've been a public defender
for 10 years.

13:16.209 --> 13:19.421
Well, Miss Wood,
this isn't a criminal trial.

13:19.421 --> 13:21.423
Your client's not accused.

13:21.423 --> 13:23.592
She doesn't have
those protections.

13:23.592 --> 13:25.761
The burden of proof is on her.

13:25.761 --> 13:28.430
In here, you're guilty
until proven innocent.

13:28.430 --> 13:30.098
So to be clear,
she's not a criminal,

13:30.098 --> 13:31.725
so you're treating her
worse than a criminal.

13:31.725 --> 13:33.685
No, we're trying to remove her
from the country.

13:33.685 --> 13:37.147
So you're trying to ship them
out as quickly as possible.

13:37.147 --> 13:41.234
Your client has been at
this facility for over a year.

13:41.234 --> 13:42.736
Or didn't you know that,
counselor?

13:46.239 --> 13:48.617
Absolutely.

13:50.869 --> 13:54.122
Well, you got that right.
Very good.

13:54.122 --> 13:55.374
I just saw Asefa.

13:55.374 --> 13:57.626
- Who?
- Asefa Ashwari, national...

13:57.626 --> 14:00.420
Oh, yeah, yeah, sad case.
Sometimes you gotta move on.

14:00.420 --> 14:02.172
She doesn't know where she is
or what's happening.

14:02.172 --> 14:03.799
When did you say
you last talked to her?

14:03.799 --> 14:06.134
Yes, sir, well, you know,
that's a testament

14:06.134 --> 14:07.135
- to who we are...
- Ray.

14:07.135 --> 14:08.470
and how we do business.

14:08.470 --> 14:10.722
- Ray!
- That's right, absolutely.

14:10.722 --> 14:12.140
Yeah.

14:13.433 --> 14:14.810
Yes, sir.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.395
That sounds absolutely fine.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.575
Judy!

15:13.452 --> 15:15.829
Judy! Judy!

15:17.539 --> 15:20.542
Judy! Judy!

15:20.542 --> 15:22.335
Judy! Judy! Judy!

15:22.335 --> 15:27.174
Judy! Judy! Judy! Judy!

15:50.697 --> 15:52.741
She's a teacher.

16:11.426 --> 16:12.761
- Miss?
- Wood.

16:12.761 --> 16:14.721
What brings you back,
Miss Wood?

16:14.721 --> 16:16.223
I'm serving you.

16:21.603 --> 16:25.273
Los Angeles County
Superior Court.

16:25.273 --> 16:27.442
What's this,
a habeas corpus petition?

16:27.442 --> 16:28.694
For her medical record

16:28.694 --> 16:30.612
and assessment
by independent expert.

16:30.612 --> 16:32.614
This is a woman
of accomplishment,

16:32.614 --> 16:34.825
nothing like the person
I met yesterday.

16:34.825 --> 16:36.451
All this shows me,
Miss Wood,

16:36.451 --> 16:38.537
is that you found
the one California judge

16:38.537 --> 16:40.956
who doesn't understand
federal jurisdiction.

16:40.956 --> 16:42.791
Which your plucky team
of fired-up attorneys

16:42.791 --> 16:44.751
can explain in detail
at the hearing.

16:44.751 --> 16:46.503
Who's your expert?

17:19.327 --> 17:21.329
What are we doing here?

17:21.329 --> 17:24.583
Helping somebody who needs us.
It's what we do.

17:26.501 --> 17:28.045
Can I get a taco?

17:28.045 --> 17:30.005
Keep the door locked.

17:41.516 --> 17:43.018
Mr. Mustafa.

17:44.394 --> 17:46.438
Mr. Mustafa.

17:46.438 --> 17:47.689
Dikembe Mustafa.

17:48.899 --> 17:51.401
No English.
We are closed.

17:55.447 --> 17:57.407
You have a doctorate
in clinical psychology

17:57.407 --> 17:58.617
from Cambridge.

17:58.617 --> 17:59.826
Oxford.

18:01.912 --> 18:02.871
Ah...

18:04.706 --> 18:07.000
You petitioned for a variance
on the work visa quota

18:07.000 --> 18:09.878
for mental health professionals
from Africa.

18:09.878 --> 18:11.380
Ray Hernandez
started the process,

18:11.421 --> 18:12.839
then asked for more money,

18:12.839 --> 18:14.049
which you can't get
without a work permit.

18:14.049 --> 18:15.801
It's a hell of a Catch 22.

18:15.801 --> 18:17.886
That is a good case summary,

18:17.928 --> 18:20.764
but I don't deal with
scumbag lawyers anymore.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.394
Here's your work visa.

18:40.617 --> 18:43.412
I got it approved.

18:55.966 --> 18:58.802
How can I be of assistance?

19:21.742 --> 19:25.120
I am Dr. Mustafa.

19:25.162 --> 19:27.164
I have come here to help you.

19:42.512 --> 19:44.806
That is no good for you.

19:47.601 --> 19:49.227
Your instincts were right.

19:49.227 --> 19:52.147
This is a clear case
of custodial overkill.

19:52.147 --> 19:54.566
There's no justification
for those dosages.

19:54.566 --> 19:56.109
- Good.
- No, it is bad.

19:56.109 --> 19:58.570
No, but it's good
for our case.

19:58.570 --> 19:59.863
What next?

19:59.863 --> 20:03.492
No more Clozapine.
No more Benzodiazepines.

20:03.533 --> 20:05.243
Slowly, we take
everything away.

20:05.243 --> 20:06.995
Slowly.

20:06.995 --> 20:09.956
Wait for the drugs to
metabolize out of her system.

20:09.956 --> 20:11.875
We'll see if anyone is home.

20:11.875 --> 20:13.210
And you're saying?

20:13.210 --> 20:16.213
We'll just have to be patient.

20:16.213 --> 20:18.548
That is all we can do.

20:26.556 --> 20:28.934
How can I help you?

20:28.934 --> 20:30.977
You remember this guy?

20:32.729 --> 20:35.774
I invite you into my home.
I feed you off my table.

20:35.774 --> 20:39.027
What do I have to show for it?
These are complicated cases.

20:39.027 --> 20:40.696
I can handle them.

20:40.737 --> 20:46.243
Registered mail, photocopying,
Lexis, and Westlaw.

20:46.243 --> 20:48.495
It all costs.

20:50.122 --> 20:51.456
Ka-thump.

21:48.972 --> 21:51.141
Dad! Dad!

21:52.809 --> 21:54.811
Dad! Dad!

21:54.811 --> 21:56.688
- Stay back!
- Dad!

21:56.688 --> 21:57.773
Stay back!

21:57.773 --> 22:00.025
- Stop, stop.
- Dad!

22:00.025 --> 22:02.944
Stay back! Stay back.

22:07.657 --> 22:08.992
You guys meeting someone?

22:10.702 --> 22:12.829
My husband.

22:12.829 --> 22:14.831
What's his name?

22:17.667 --> 22:19.378
Jorge.

22:19.378 --> 22:21.838
If your husband does get
sent back to Honduras,

22:21.838 --> 22:24.966
it's likely he will be
persecuted by the secret police

22:24.966 --> 22:27.052
because he's a journalist.

22:27.052 --> 22:28.970
If we can prove that,

22:28.970 --> 22:30.889
then we have a very good case
for asylum.

22:32.849 --> 22:36.353
No one's ever explained it to me
like that before.

22:36.353 --> 22:38.021
Judy, I have some friends.

22:42.359 --> 22:44.986
I'm not promising anything,
but I'll do my best.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.993
Judy, gracias.

22:51.993 --> 22:54.079
Of course.

23:09.803 --> 23:12.389
I'm Judy Wood.
I'm an immigration lawyer.

23:12.389 --> 23:14.975
If there's anything
that you need help with...

23:29.823 --> 23:31.366
Judy, come here.

23:32.743 --> 23:34.161
This is Asefa's uncle, Omar.

23:34.161 --> 23:35.996
Hello.

23:35.996 --> 23:39.207
Omar is a highly valued client
with a very promising case.

23:39.207 --> 23:41.877
We're hoping for some
excellent news very soon.

23:41.877 --> 23:43.045
Judy's here to fill me in

23:43.045 --> 23:44.838
on the progress
with Miss Ashwari,

23:44.838 --> 23:46.715
who I referred to Ms. Wood
because of her...

23:48.050 --> 23:49.718
...unique skill set.

23:49.718 --> 23:53.263
Ms. Wood, have you seen Asefa?
How is she?

23:53.263 --> 23:54.973
Tired.

23:54.973 --> 23:57.184
Judy, we need to talk.
Would you excuse us, Omar?

23:57.184 --> 23:58.268
Yes, of course, please.

24:00.896 --> 24:03.231
Mommy! Mommy!

24:10.322 --> 24:14.743
You wanted clients,
here they are.

24:14.743 --> 24:17.913
I got a phone call about you
from the detention center.

24:17.913 --> 24:19.998
I have them on the run.

24:19.998 --> 24:22.459
You embarrass this office, Judy.

24:22.501 --> 24:25.754
You embarrassed me.

24:25.754 --> 24:29.132
You don't serve an ICE officer.

24:29.174 --> 24:30.759
You're supposed to go
through the proper channels!

24:30.759 --> 24:32.052
It worked though, didn't it?

24:32.052 --> 24:34.471
You were there
to introduce yourself,

24:34.471 --> 24:36.264
to learn the ropes,

24:36.264 --> 24:38.475
to show them you're someone
they can work with.

24:38.517 --> 24:40.477
I work for my clients, Ray.

24:40.477 --> 24:44.147
You can't take these kind of
risks on a case you won't win.

24:44.147 --> 24:46.483
Ask the hundreds of lawyers
who have wasted their time

24:46.483 --> 24:49.361
on cases just like this.

24:49.361 --> 24:51.154
You never talked to her.

24:51.154 --> 24:52.823
- Excuse me?
- You never talked to her.

24:52.823 --> 24:54.491
You don't know
anything about her.

24:54.491 --> 24:57.244
Of course I didn't talk to her.
The woman's catatonic.

24:57.244 --> 25:01.998
She was a schoolteacher, Ray.
She taught girls.

25:01.998 --> 25:04.501
You know how I know that?
Take a guess.

25:04.543 --> 25:06.002
You can't help her.

25:06.002 --> 25:07.546
I know I can.

25:07.546 --> 25:09.423
I have seen
that detainee register,

25:09.423 --> 25:11.007
and I have walked that yard,

25:11.049 --> 25:13.218
and there are
a thousand women just like her.

25:14.428 --> 25:17.139
Have you ever read
this book, Judy?

25:17.139 --> 25:18.890
Have you read this one?

25:18.890 --> 25:22.394
Don't give them false hope.

25:22.394 --> 25:24.438
You know, you're not
qualified for this.

25:24.438 --> 25:25.814
You hired me.

25:25.814 --> 25:27.524
You cannot change
the world, Judy.

25:27.566 --> 25:29.860
It won't do you or them
any good.

25:29.901 --> 25:31.903
Trust me.
I've been down that path.

25:33.572 --> 25:35.490
Clearly not that far.

25:37.409 --> 25:38.952
This was a big mistake.

25:42.122 --> 25:43.331
You're firing me.

25:43.331 --> 25:44.249
That's right.

25:48.545 --> 25:50.547
And take your clients with you.

25:50.547 --> 25:52.299
Please don't let them
deport her.

25:52.299 --> 25:54.885
She'll die if she goes back.
You have to save her.

25:54.885 --> 25:56.094
I'm trying.

26:04.186 --> 26:06.480
- Judy Wood.
- Hey. Jenny.

26:06.480 --> 26:08.106
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

26:08.106 --> 26:10.275
Come on in.
I'll show you the space.

26:10.275 --> 26:12.402
Great restaurant
across the street.

26:13.987 --> 26:17.115
I think this place
will be perfect for you.

26:17.115 --> 26:19.451
You'll just have to do
a little cleanup.

26:21.328 --> 26:24.956
So first and last month's rent,
and it's yours.

26:27.626 --> 26:29.461
I'll take it.

26:32.089 --> 26:33.882
Okay, here we go.

27:04.996 --> 27:06.623
Oh!

27:35.068 --> 27:37.195
- Mister...
- You can call me Parker.

27:37.195 --> 27:38.530
- Parker?
- Yeah.

27:38.530 --> 27:40.699
What is your interest
in immigration law?

27:40.699 --> 27:42.701
Mm-hm.

27:42.701 --> 27:44.286
Yeah, um...

27:44.286 --> 27:47.205
Good. I, uh...

27:47.205 --> 27:49.541
Personally, for me, I...

27:49.541 --> 27:51.376
You know, um, uh...

27:53.420 --> 27:57.549
P-Parents, my grandparents,
immigrants, you know.

27:57.549 --> 27:59.676
Um...

27:59.676 --> 28:02.971
Honestly, I...

28:02.971 --> 28:04.973
I need an internship
to graduate,

28:04.973 --> 28:07.601
so I can work at
my father's law firm.

28:07.601 --> 28:08.560
Um...

28:11.229 --> 28:13.482
Is that gonna be a problem?

28:13.482 --> 28:15.442
Honestly, I just need
to be in Lancaster

28:15.442 --> 28:16.401
in under an hour.

31:11.201 --> 31:13.328
You don't say much.

31:15.747 --> 31:18.125
That's because I'm listening.

31:23.296 --> 31:26.174
Would you like me to read back
to you what I have so far?

31:31.263 --> 31:34.182
"My name is Asefa Ashwari.

31:34.182 --> 31:35.809
My father's a tribal leader.

31:35.809 --> 31:37.602
I went to vocational school
in Pakistan,

31:37.644 --> 31:40.439
and upon my return, I taught
at a school for girls..."

31:40.439 --> 31:43.817
I started the school
for girls.

31:43.817 --> 31:45.777
You started the school.

31:49.614 --> 31:52.284
What happened
when the Taliban came?

31:59.416 --> 32:01.251
I could marry Omar.

32:01.251 --> 32:02.711
Then there wouldn't need
to be a trial.

32:02.711 --> 32:04.379
He has a very good case.

32:04.379 --> 32:06.840
- But he's your uncle.
- How will anyone know?

32:06.840 --> 32:08.675
You have
attorney privilege, right?

32:08.675 --> 32:10.635
And it wouldn't be
a real marriage.

32:10.677 --> 32:13.680
You need to have your own case.

32:13.680 --> 32:16.308
Asefa, you are smart enough
to do my job,

32:16.308 --> 32:18.310
and once you testify,
they will beg you to stay,

32:18.310 --> 32:20.896
but you must tell your story.

32:25.025 --> 32:26.818
What happened?

32:32.324 --> 32:34.868
We were walking to the school.

32:34.868 --> 32:37.412
- We?
- The students...

32:37.412 --> 32:39.247
and Nazeera,
the other teacher.

32:41.541 --> 32:44.336
<i>Usually we taught
in secret,</i>

32:44.336 --> 32:46.338
<i>but not that day.</i>

32:46.338 --> 32:51.551
<i>We walked in the street
to show them we were strong.</i>

33:05.565 --> 33:08.735
<i>There were men there,
not from the village.</i>

33:27.045 --> 33:29.506
<i>Some Taliban fighters arrived.</i>

34:06.084 --> 34:07.919
Take your time, Asefa.

34:11.005 --> 34:12.882
They took me to jail.

34:31.525 --> 34:33.487
<i>How long were you there?</i>

34:35.155 --> 34:36.739
<i>Were you questioned?</i>

34:38.658 --> 34:39.993
<i>Were you beaten?</i>

34:41.995 --> 34:44.414
<i>She doesn't know
how long she was held.</i>

34:44.414 --> 34:46.041
<i>When she was released,</i>

34:46.041 --> 34:49.002
<i>her friends smuggled her
across the border to Pakistan.</i>

35:09.648 --> 35:12.401
<i>She fled to the US
and was living with her uncle,</i>

35:12.401 --> 35:15.904
<i>when she was picked up by ICE.</i>

35:15.904 --> 35:19.574
We were able to obtain
her medical record.

35:19.574 --> 35:23.453
She suffered a broken wrist,
bruised ribs, concussion,

35:23.453 --> 35:25.747
injuries to the face,
loss of blood.

35:34.756 --> 35:38.385
Miss Ashwari,
based on your testimony today...

35:40.637 --> 35:43.598
I find sufficient evidence
to support your plea for asylum

35:43.598 --> 35:47.185
based on a credible
fear of persecution.

35:47.185 --> 35:50.147
I therefore refer your case
to a judge for trial.

35:50.147 --> 35:53.150
I also order your release
from this detention facility.

35:53.150 --> 35:54.735
Thank you.

35:54.735 --> 35:57.529
We'll get you processed
as soon as possible.

35:57.529 --> 35:59.906
Good luck, Miss Ashwari.

36:08.832 --> 36:10.876
It's only gonna
get harder from here.

36:10.876 --> 36:14.504
Even if a mountain is very high,
it has a path to the top.

36:24.765 --> 36:26.850
Hello, this is Judy Wood.

36:29.227 --> 36:32.856
Your son threw this
in a crowded room.

36:32.856 --> 36:35.567
Someone could've been
seriously hurt.

36:40.864 --> 36:42.741
TTNBTT.

36:42.741 --> 36:44.493
What did you just tell him?

36:44.493 --> 36:45.952
The truth and nothing
but the truth.

36:45.952 --> 36:47.788
Did you throw this?

36:47.788 --> 36:49.081
I need you to speak up.

36:49.081 --> 36:50.832
You need to defend yourself.

36:50.832 --> 36:52.042
No, I didn't throw it.

36:55.670 --> 36:56.880
My son didn't do this.

36:56.880 --> 36:58.507
There were witnesses.

36:58.507 --> 37:00.550
Because whoever did do it

37:00.550 --> 37:03.303
would never try to blame it
on the new kid.

37:03.303 --> 37:04.763
Mm-hm.

37:04.763 --> 37:05.931
308?

37:05.931 --> 37:08.141
That's the art room.

37:08.141 --> 37:10.060
But this happened
in my son's regular classroom.

37:10.060 --> 37:11.687
- That's right.
- It's Wednesday,

37:11.687 --> 37:13.897
and my son has art
first thing after roll call.

37:13.897 --> 37:16.233
So you claim my son
stole this at 9 a.m.

37:16.233 --> 37:17.651
and then carried it
around with him

37:17.651 --> 37:19.319
through math, lunch, PE,

37:19.319 --> 37:21.697
to only throw it in the middle
of the class this afternoon?

37:21.697 --> 37:23.532
I don't claim to know
what he was thinking.

37:23.532 --> 37:25.784
Well, let's talk to Mr. Padilla,
his art teacher.

37:25.784 --> 37:27.536
That is his name, isn't it?

37:27.536 --> 37:29.663
Because if someone stole
his stapler this morning,

37:29.663 --> 37:32.124
then he would have had
five classes in the interim,

37:32.124 --> 37:34.584
and 200 students
is an awful lot of handouts,

37:34.584 --> 37:38.922
and you think he might have
noticed it was missing.

37:38.922 --> 37:42.092
Ms. Wood, I am not
starting this with you.

37:42.092 --> 37:43.635
But you did start it with me.

37:43.635 --> 37:45.721
Did you investigate
the incident at all?

37:45.721 --> 37:49.015
I mean, at the very least,
we should speak to Mr. Padilla.

37:49.057 --> 37:50.308
He has left for the day.

37:50.308 --> 37:51.852
Then I will
come back tomorrow,

37:51.852 --> 37:53.770
and I will question him
and anyone else

37:53.770 --> 37:54.855
with knowledge of that matter.

37:54.855 --> 37:55.814
No.

38:02.320 --> 38:04.156
There's no suspension.

38:04.156 --> 38:05.949
There's nothing on his record.

38:05.949 --> 38:07.743
My son's a good boy.

38:07.743 --> 38:09.703
He's a wonderful boy.

38:11.329 --> 38:13.248
If you bothered
to get to know him.

38:18.170 --> 38:19.755
Alex.

38:21.256 --> 38:23.675
- Alex.
- What?

38:23.675 --> 38:26.011
You can't just leave it
up to me like that.

38:26.011 --> 38:27.679
You have to speak up
for yourself.

38:27.679 --> 38:29.848
- I did.
- You should have tried harder.

38:29.848 --> 38:31.099
She wouldn't believe me.

38:31.099 --> 38:33.226
You've got to make them
believe you.

38:33.268 --> 38:34.728
You know how these things work.

38:34.728 --> 38:37.022
You have to fight
for everything.

38:37.022 --> 38:38.648
You have to stand by the truth.

38:38.648 --> 38:40.275
She believed you.

38:40.275 --> 38:43.737
That is because
I didn't give up.

38:43.737 --> 38:45.572
I'll never give up.

39:26.405 --> 39:28.115
We're filing an I-130.

39:28.115 --> 39:29.783
That will allow your husband
to stay in the country

39:29.783 --> 39:31.368
with you and your children
for a while.

39:31.368 --> 39:34.705
You being a lawful
permanent resident helps,

39:34.705 --> 39:37.332
but it's not everything.

39:42.879 --> 39:44.172
Uno momento.

39:44.172 --> 39:48.176
Uh, no espanol hable.

39:48.176 --> 39:51.138
Lo siento. Uh...

39:51.138 --> 39:54.725
Uh, nosotros, filing,
you know...

39:56.893 --> 39:59.813
J-J-Just stop, stop.
What are you trying to say?

39:59.813 --> 40:01.815
The visa, the I-130.

40:01.857 --> 40:03.859
Okay, just stop, I got this.

40:09.823 --> 40:10.824
Okay?

40:13.160 --> 40:16.371
I failed Spanish and French.

40:16.371 --> 40:18.165
You don't say.

40:18.165 --> 40:21.334
Well, I also make
a mean posole, so...

40:21.334 --> 40:22.836
I can, uh...

40:22.878 --> 40:26.298
I could make it for you
sometime, if you, uh...

40:26.298 --> 40:28.050
- Judy?
- Dikembe.

40:28.050 --> 40:29.718
Hi.

40:29.718 --> 40:30.761
<i>Hasta luego.</i>

40:31.887 --> 40:33.889
- Thank you.
- Here you are.

40:33.889 --> 40:36.058
It's good to be a doctor again.

40:36.058 --> 40:37.768
You're good at it.

40:37.768 --> 40:39.770
Follow me. I have a case
from Sierra Leone,

40:39.770 --> 40:41.480
a soldier suffering from PTSD.

40:41.480 --> 40:43.065
No. Come here.

40:44.775 --> 40:47.235
You must understand,
those people. I know them.

40:47.235 --> 40:48.779
I've seen what they can do.

40:48.779 --> 40:50.947
They are nothing but killers,
all of them.

40:53.367 --> 40:54.785
Judy!

40:56.244 --> 40:58.914
What are you doing?
What are you...

41:28.360 --> 41:30.445
My name is Dikembe.

41:33.532 --> 41:34.866
What is yours?

42:09.526 --> 42:11.319
Um...

42:14.322 --> 42:16.074
- Okay? You understand?
- Sure.

42:16.074 --> 42:18.827
Omar, did we have
an appointment?

42:18.827 --> 42:22.330
No, and I'd like to know why.
We have a trial coming up.

42:22.330 --> 42:24.458
You should teach Asefa
what to say.

42:24.458 --> 42:26.043
Ray tells me what to say.

42:26.043 --> 42:28.336
I believe it's not good
to sound over-rehearsed.

42:28.336 --> 42:30.839
But you should be
preparing her.

42:30.839 --> 42:34.176
And I will, as soon as
the government files motions.

42:34.176 --> 42:37.137
I'd love to hear
how Asefa's doing.

42:37.137 --> 42:39.222
Ask her yourself.

42:43.393 --> 42:45.228
Asefa.

42:46.355 --> 42:48.565
You're staring.

42:48.565 --> 42:51.026
You're a completely
different person.

42:51.026 --> 42:53.195
Thanks to you.

42:54.988 --> 42:58.075
My mother gave this to me,
and I want you to have it.

43:02.496 --> 43:03.538
It's beautiful.

43:05.332 --> 43:07.459
Thank you.

43:07.459 --> 43:10.003
I'm glad you came in.

43:10.003 --> 43:13.173
I'm ready to get started
if you are.

43:13.173 --> 43:15.217
- Thank you.
- Yes.

43:16.551 --> 43:19.513
Trials are always hard.

43:19.513 --> 43:21.348
We may get a tough judge,

43:21.348 --> 43:23.350
and there will also be
government lawyers

43:23.350 --> 43:25.519
trying to poke
holes in your story.

43:25.519 --> 43:28.355
But she's not lying.
They can't prove that.

43:28.355 --> 43:29.564
They don't have to.

43:29.564 --> 43:31.983
The burden of proof is on us.

43:31.983 --> 43:34.653
And we don't have
a clear-cut case.

43:34.653 --> 43:37.197
And the Law of Asylum
only protects you

43:37.197 --> 43:40.200
if you are part
of a persecuted group.

43:40.200 --> 43:42.077
And, Asefa, you are Muslim,

43:42.077 --> 43:44.079
and ethnically,
you are a Pashtun.

43:44.079 --> 43:46.540
It's gonna be hard to prove
that you're a minority.

43:50.043 --> 43:52.045
I'm gonna need to know
exactly what happened to you

43:52.045 --> 43:54.047
that night in jail.

44:03.432 --> 44:05.350
Omar, I'm gonna need you
to step out.

44:32.586 --> 44:34.296
What was that?

44:36.548 --> 44:38.550
Have your memories come back?

44:38.550 --> 44:39.634
No.

44:42.137 --> 44:45.974
I'll do what I can, but at
trial, you'll have to testify.

44:48.310 --> 44:53.023
It's like this all be
happening all over again.

44:55.609 --> 44:57.319
Your famous silences.

44:59.071 --> 45:02.157
Do you want me to read back
what I have so far?

45:09.498 --> 45:11.750
Parker, you might strive to keep
the speed below the temperature.

45:11.750 --> 45:14.711
Oh, no, these are kilometers.

45:14.711 --> 45:17.047
No, they're not.

45:17.047 --> 45:19.299
Oh. Oops.

45:19.299 --> 45:21.343
You got me.

45:25.555 --> 45:27.182
What's that?

45:43.532 --> 45:45.450
Give 'em hell, guys.

46:19.151 --> 46:21.153
Hear ye, hear ye.

46:21.153 --> 46:23.488
Please be seated.

46:23.488 --> 46:26.700
Ms. Wood, I have not
had the pleasure

46:26.700 --> 46:28.869
of having you in my courtroom.

46:28.869 --> 46:32.247
I see this is
your very first trial here.

46:32.289 --> 46:33.623
It is, Your Honor.

46:33.623 --> 46:35.625
Wanna know how I knew that?

46:35.625 --> 46:36.835
Your Honor?

46:36.835 --> 46:39.212
You're wearing perfume

46:39.212 --> 46:43.133
in these close quarters,
in this heat.

46:43.133 --> 46:47.345
If you have a chance
to try another case,

46:47.345 --> 46:50.265
I hope you take that
under advisement.

46:51.433 --> 46:53.643
Thank you, Your Honor.

46:53.643 --> 46:55.103
Is your client ready?

46:55.145 --> 46:57.606
Vinny, your cue.

46:57.606 --> 46:59.483
Please stand.

46:59.483 --> 47:01.193
Raise your right hand.

47:01.193 --> 47:03.403
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

47:03.403 --> 47:04.488
and nothing but the truth?

47:04.488 --> 47:05.489
I do.

47:05.489 --> 47:06.656
Be seated.

47:10.786 --> 47:15.707
Asefa, what made you
want to be a teacher?

47:15.707 --> 47:17.709
I wanted to teach girls.

47:17.709 --> 47:20.754
Were girls normally taught
in your village?

47:20.754 --> 47:23.382
No. They did not
want us to read.

47:23.382 --> 47:25.300
They did not want us to think.

47:25.300 --> 47:28.470
Who taught you
to read and think?

47:28.512 --> 47:30.347
I learned to think on my own.

47:30.347 --> 47:33.684
My mother taught me to read
in secret.

47:33.684 --> 47:34.935
Objection, narrative.

47:34.935 --> 47:36.645
Settle down, Benjamin.

47:36.687 --> 47:37.938
Yes, Your Honor.

47:37.938 --> 47:40.607
After you received
formal schooling,

47:40.607 --> 47:43.819
why did you return
to your village in Afghanistan?

47:43.819 --> 47:47.531
My mother was dying,
and I had to take care of her.

47:47.531 --> 47:52.411
And after she passed,
why did you stay on?

47:52.411 --> 47:53.870
My father was sad.

47:56.790 --> 48:00.502
Let's talk about
your school for girls.

48:00.502 --> 48:01.545
Did the village support it?

48:01.545 --> 48:03.547
Objection, leading.

48:03.547 --> 48:05.298
Okay, I'll shut up.

48:05.298 --> 48:07.884
They did not support it.

48:07.884 --> 48:09.886
They wouldn't let
the girls come.

48:09.886 --> 48:13.390
Most days, we only
had two or three.

48:13.390 --> 48:15.475
Did you receive any support
from the government?

48:15.475 --> 48:17.352
The Taliban? No.

48:17.352 --> 48:21.231
Asefa, what happened
on April 9th?

48:23.275 --> 48:26.236
The students,
the other teacher, and I

48:26.236 --> 48:27.863
walked to class together.

48:27.863 --> 48:30.574
Why did you do that?

48:30.574 --> 48:34.703
To show them we didn't care
what they thought.

48:34.703 --> 48:36.830
And what happened then?

48:36.830 --> 48:39.332
Some men
from outside the village

48:39.332 --> 48:40.959
started throwing dirt.

48:40.959 --> 48:43.336
Then the police came.

48:43.336 --> 48:45.422
I was arrested.

48:46.965 --> 48:48.842
You spent the night in jail?

48:48.842 --> 48:51.261
I know. Calm yourself.

48:52.471 --> 48:55.640
You spent the night in jail.

48:55.640 --> 48:58.643
You must use words,
Miss Ashwari.

48:58.643 --> 48:59.895
Yes.

49:01.521 --> 49:03.940
What's the next thing
you remember?

49:08.779 --> 49:10.947
Waking up at the clinic.

49:20.374 --> 49:21.541
Your witness.

49:21.541 --> 49:22.918
Your Honor, if I may.

49:22.918 --> 49:25.420
I have a few questions first.

49:25.420 --> 49:29.549
Miss Ashwari, you loved
your mother very much.

49:30.717 --> 49:32.052
Yes.

49:32.052 --> 49:34.054
That's why you returned
to your village.

49:34.054 --> 49:36.306
Yes.

49:36.306 --> 49:38.642
You stayed on, you say,

49:38.642 --> 49:41.353
because your father was sad
after her death.

49:41.353 --> 49:43.313
Yes.

49:44.648 --> 49:47.484
You must love your father
very much.

49:47.484 --> 49:48.944
I do.

49:48.944 --> 49:50.946
You love your brothers?

49:50.946 --> 49:52.489
Yes.

49:52.489 --> 49:54.032
And yet...

49:54.032 --> 49:56.993
you apply for asylum
in the United States.

49:58.495 --> 50:01.081
You must know
that if it is granted,

50:01.081 --> 50:03.458
you will never see
any of them again.

50:03.458 --> 50:06.044
Not your brothers,
not your father.

50:06.044 --> 50:07.838
Yet you say you love them.

50:07.838 --> 50:10.549
I do.
I'm going to visit them.

50:15.512 --> 50:16.972
Someday.

50:19.474 --> 50:21.727
I hope to visit them someday

50:21.727 --> 50:25.480
when there is no threat
of persecution.

50:28.734 --> 50:32.529
Nice save, Ms. Wood.
You coached your client well.

50:32.529 --> 50:35.032
Benjamin, you may proceed
with your cross.

50:35.032 --> 50:36.700
Thank you, Your Honor.

50:36.700 --> 50:40.579
Miss Ashwari, you were
very brave to testify today.

50:40.579 --> 50:43.623
I thank you for keeping
your testimony truthful.

50:45.584 --> 50:49.588
You don't remember everything
that happened that day, do you?

50:49.588 --> 50:50.881
No, I don't.

50:50.881 --> 50:52.758
Why is that?

50:52.758 --> 50:55.844
Because I suffer from
post traumatic stress disorder.

50:55.844 --> 50:58.847
You're not going to object
that she's not an expert?

50:58.847 --> 51:00.849
I accept
Miss Ashwari's expertise

51:00.849 --> 51:03.810
in the state of her own mind.

51:03.810 --> 51:07.022
Miss Ashwari, now, you said that
men from outside your village

51:07.022 --> 51:08.565
threw dirt at you.

51:08.565 --> 51:10.400
Yes.

51:10.400 --> 51:12.778
Were those the same men
who arrested you?

51:12.778 --> 51:13.779
No.

51:13.779 --> 51:15.447
They weren't police?

51:15.447 --> 51:16.656
There were just random guys?

51:16.656 --> 51:18.116
They weren't in uniform?

51:18.116 --> 51:19.409
Yes.

51:19.409 --> 51:20.952
And the dirt they threw at you

51:20.952 --> 51:22.913
was actually hard-packed
lumps of clay.

51:22.913 --> 51:24.456
Yes.

51:24.456 --> 51:26.500
You testified
that you remember waking up

51:26.500 --> 51:28.418
at the hospital the next day.

51:28.418 --> 51:31.588
Do you remember your injuries?

51:31.630 --> 51:33.340
Yes.

51:34.674 --> 51:36.802
You had injuries to your face,

51:36.802 --> 51:38.095
bruised ribs,

51:38.136 --> 51:40.097
and a concussion.

51:40.097 --> 51:41.932
Yes.

51:41.973 --> 51:43.892
Any other injuries?

51:48.480 --> 51:52.943
Do you remember anything
of the night you spent in jail?

51:55.737 --> 51:56.697
No.

51:57.989 --> 51:59.866
Then how can you be sure
these injuries

51:59.866 --> 52:01.118
were caused by the police?

52:01.159 --> 52:03.662
You testify your PTSD
makes it hard

52:03.662 --> 52:04.913
for you to remember that day.

52:04.913 --> 52:06.665
Objection, badgering.

52:06.665 --> 52:08.542
- Your Honor.
- Overruled.

52:08.542 --> 52:11.169
Weren't all these injuries
caused not by the police,

52:11.169 --> 52:14.840
but by those random men
who threw lumps at you?

52:17.050 --> 52:19.511
No answer?

52:21.179 --> 52:25.183
I have only
one more point to make.

52:25.183 --> 52:28.812
Miss Ashwari,
do you remember your arrest?

52:28.812 --> 52:30.480
Yes.

52:30.522 --> 52:33.191
You testified you were arrested
at a demonstration.

52:33.191 --> 52:36.778
Yes. I was arrested because
I wanted everyone to know

52:36.778 --> 52:40.032
that girls
should think for themselves.

52:43.243 --> 52:45.829
Your Honor,

52:45.829 --> 52:47.873
counsel,

52:47.873 --> 52:52.502
I draw your attention
to exhibit B,

52:52.502 --> 52:56.506
the warrant for Asefa Ashwari's
arrest on April 9th.

52:56.506 --> 52:58.175
Objection, Your Honor.

52:58.175 --> 53:01.011
Prosecution hasn't shared
any of this evidence with me.

53:01.011 --> 53:02.137
Prosecution?

53:02.137 --> 53:04.056
This is not a criminal court.

53:04.056 --> 53:06.183
And those are not
the rules of evidence

53:06.183 --> 53:08.185
in this courtroom, Ms. Wood.

53:08.185 --> 53:11.521
My apology, Your Honor.
Apologies to counsel.

53:11.521 --> 53:14.941
But this? This is not something
I could have access to.

53:14.941 --> 53:17.235
I only obtained it
in an effort to corroborate

53:17.235 --> 53:19.821
Miss Ashwari's claims
of persecution.

53:19.821 --> 53:21.907
Objection overruled.
Proceed.

53:21.907 --> 53:24.701
The warrant states that
you were arrested on April 9th,

53:24.701 --> 53:26.244
just as you said,

53:26.244 --> 53:28.663
but it doesn't mention
any demonstration.

53:28.663 --> 53:30.832
Your Honor, counsel should
not be allowed to argue

53:30.832 --> 53:32.084
that my client
on the one hand

53:32.084 --> 53:33.919
was injured
at the demonstration,

53:33.919 --> 53:36.630
and then on the other that the
demonstration never happened.

53:36.630 --> 53:37.631
Do you have an objection?

53:37.631 --> 53:39.758
My objection is logic.

53:39.758 --> 53:41.051
That is not a legal objection.

53:41.051 --> 53:42.678
And that's not what I'm saying.

53:42.678 --> 53:46.932
There was a demonstration,
and there was an arrest.

53:46.932 --> 53:49.685
But Miss Ashwari wasn't
persecuted because of it.

53:49.685 --> 53:54.731
Ms. Wood, if you would please
show Miss Ashwari exhibit B.

54:13.250 --> 54:16.753
Miss Ashwari, this is a copy
of the original arrest report

54:16.753 --> 54:18.130
in your native language.

54:18.130 --> 54:20.298
Objection,
calls for legal conclusion.

54:20.298 --> 54:21.633
Overruled.

54:21.633 --> 54:23.051
Miss Ashwari...

54:25.095 --> 54:28.682
would you please read
the name of the informant?

54:30.142 --> 54:32.894
The informant who reported you
to the police.

54:34.146 --> 54:36.106
Your mother taught you to read.

54:42.112 --> 54:44.656
What name is written there?

54:47.617 --> 54:49.327
What does it say?

54:55.000 --> 54:56.710
Naiem Ashwari.

54:56.710 --> 54:58.211
Who is that?

55:03.050 --> 55:04.259
My father.

55:09.181 --> 55:10.724
My father.

55:11.808 --> 55:13.143
I can't breathe.

55:13.143 --> 55:16.938
Your Honor, this is not
a political persecution.

55:16.938 --> 55:19.024
- I can't breathe.
- It's a family squabble.

55:19.024 --> 55:21.693
Ma'am, I'm gonna
need you to sit down.

55:21.693 --> 55:23.862
Ma'am, I'm gonna need
you to sit down.

55:36.333 --> 55:39.628
It's my fault. I failed.

55:41.671 --> 55:43.673
When will I be deported?

55:43.673 --> 55:47.260
What? No.
The trial's been continued.

55:47.260 --> 55:49.262
We'll have redirect
in one week,

55:49.262 --> 55:52.307
and I can prepare you.

55:52.307 --> 55:54.059
How could my father do that?

55:54.059 --> 55:56.728
It's not about him
no matter what they say.

55:56.728 --> 55:58.939
What counts is what happened
to you in that jail cell.

55:58.939 --> 56:00.065
And, Asefa...

56:16.123 --> 56:18.125
What are you telling my client?

56:18.125 --> 56:20.252
What kind of lawyer are you?
Just give her the words to say.

56:20.252 --> 56:22.045
I know the law,

56:22.045 --> 56:25.298
and I know a little bit more
about trials than you do.

56:25.298 --> 56:29.219
All she needs to do to win
is to tell the truth.

56:29.219 --> 56:31.179
I used to think like you,

56:31.179 --> 56:33.932
about my country,

56:33.932 --> 56:37.227
but it's the same everywhere.

56:37.227 --> 56:39.229
You're dragging her
to that trailer

56:39.229 --> 56:40.272
to be tortured for nothing!

56:40.272 --> 56:42.024
No!

56:42.024 --> 56:44.776
Not for nothing.

56:44.776 --> 56:48.363
I swear to you,
not for nothing.

56:51.074 --> 56:54.286
Oof! Uh, you got smoked.

56:54.286 --> 56:56.038
<i>We got smoked.</i>

56:56.038 --> 56:57.831
You're actually
a part of this now.

56:57.831 --> 56:59.458
Tell me how he did it.

56:59.458 --> 57:02.461
Well, if she was bruised by some
assholes throwing dirt clods,

57:02.461 --> 57:04.212
then she wasn't persecuted
by the government.

57:04.212 --> 57:06.006
Yes.

57:06.006 --> 57:08.175
And if her dickhead father
asked for her to be arrested...

57:08.175 --> 57:11.053
Jesus Christ, not even my dad's
that big of a prick...

57:11.053 --> 57:13.847
then she wasn't singled out
for her politics.

57:13.847 --> 57:17.392
That's the whole of it.
Thoughts?

57:17.392 --> 57:20.437
It's her fault if she loses.

57:20.437 --> 57:22.814
<i>I'm sorry, but if
she doesn't have the cojones</i>

57:22.814 --> 57:24.024
to say what really happened
to her...

57:24.024 --> 57:25.150
Would you?

57:25.150 --> 57:27.027
Would you tell your father?

57:27.027 --> 57:29.029
Would you tell your friends?
Would you tell me?

57:29.029 --> 57:32.282
- Tell you what?
- That you were raped.

57:34.242 --> 57:36.870
But you are right.

57:36.870 --> 57:39.122
If she doesn't testify,
we'll lose.

57:41.208 --> 57:42.918
What's this?

57:42.918 --> 57:46.004
It's, uh, bills.

57:46.004 --> 57:47.547
We got a lot of them.

57:47.547 --> 57:50.509
Turns out you're actually
supposed to pay those.

58:25.377 --> 58:28.797
Hey, Mom, can Jorge and Raul
sleep over?

58:31.508 --> 58:33.260
Is this my fault?

58:34.386 --> 58:36.888
<i>Vamanos. MaÃ±ana, Alex.</i>

58:38.974 --> 58:40.892
I asked you a question.

58:42.185 --> 58:44.312
I was just borrowing
some things.

58:46.064 --> 58:48.442
- Shoplifting?
- No.

58:48.442 --> 58:51.403
Where did you get the money
to buy an iPod?

58:51.403 --> 58:54.406
Kids leave stuff
lying around at school.

58:54.406 --> 58:58.118
And you take them.

58:58.118 --> 59:00.912
You don't take what doesn't
belong to you, Alex.

59:00.912 --> 59:03.081
You know better than that.

59:03.081 --> 59:05.333
Why do I have to be perfect?

59:05.333 --> 59:07.461
You learned that
from your father.

59:07.461 --> 59:09.463
Let me tell you something, kid.

59:09.463 --> 59:13.300
There's a big difference
between this and perfection.

59:13.300 --> 59:16.928
Just let them suspend me.
I hate that school.

59:16.928 --> 59:19.056
I'm calling your father,

59:19.056 --> 59:21.350
and you're gonna return all of
this tomorrow with an apology,

59:21.350 --> 59:23.852
and then we'll discuss
punishment.

59:46.583 --> 59:48.251
Ah, in LA?

59:54.466 --> 59:57.427
Hello, this is Judy Wood.

59:57.427 --> 01:00:00.555
Yes, it is, but I'm gonna
have to call you back.

01:00:00.555 --> 01:00:02.140
Okay, I promise.

01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:09.314
So the adventure continues.

01:00:11.233 --> 01:00:14.152
Not even here six months,
and you spawn your own practice.

01:00:14.194 --> 01:00:17.155
I need you to talk to Alex.

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:19.491
He got into trouble,
you want me to fix it.

01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:21.451
I love how when he's Good Alex,
he's yours,

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:23.620
but when he's Bad Alex, I'm the
one who has to deal with it.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:25.664
Can you talk to him, Matthew?

01:00:25.706 --> 01:00:28.333
I have always done
everything you've asked.

01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:31.169
What am I asking you,
just to be clear?

01:00:31.211 --> 01:00:33.004
I will take him to return
the shit he stole

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:34.214
from his classmates,

01:00:34.214 --> 01:00:36.216
and he will apologize,
trust me.

01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:38.218
He can hate me
if he wants to.

01:00:38.218 --> 01:00:39.928
Thank you.

01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:44.182
I hope he inherited the best
qualities of the two of us

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:46.476
and not the worst.

01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:48.437
He's resilient like you.

01:00:48.437 --> 01:00:50.939
Turns out
that can come in handy.

01:01:07.581 --> 01:01:10.292
<i>Hello. Please leave a message.</i>

01:01:11.543 --> 01:01:14.254
Asefa, it's Judy Wood again.

01:01:14.254 --> 01:01:16.506
Your hearing's tomorrow.

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:20.510
So, please, would you
call me back, please?

01:01:22.596 --> 01:01:24.348
And listen.

01:01:24.348 --> 01:01:27.476
You can do this.
You are stronger than you think.

01:01:27.476 --> 01:01:30.103
Stronger than all of them.

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:41.573
Please stand.

01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:44.409
Raise your right hand.

01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:46.244
Do you solemnly swear
that you will tell the truth,

01:01:46.244 --> 01:01:48.121
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

01:01:48.121 --> 01:01:49.164
I do.

01:01:49.164 --> 01:01:50.123
Have a seat.

01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:58.632
Asefa, did you know
that your father

01:01:58.632 --> 01:02:00.801
was the one who reported you
to the police?

01:02:00.801 --> 01:02:03.053
- No.
- Why do you think he did that?

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:03.970
Objection.

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:08.266
What was your relationship like?

01:02:08.266 --> 01:02:10.477
I wasn't the daughter he wanted.

01:02:10.477 --> 01:02:14.147
I didn't listen.
I talked back too much.

01:02:14.147 --> 01:02:16.233
I didn't marry.

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:18.443
Did others in your village
feel that way?

01:02:18.443 --> 01:02:22.489
Yes. A lot wouldn't send
their girls to the school.

01:02:22.489 --> 01:02:26.159
They thought I would
teach them to be like me.

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:28.537
They didn't like how you
expressed yourself as a woman.

01:02:28.537 --> 01:02:30.163
Objection,
counsel is testifying.

01:02:30.163 --> 01:02:31.331
That's why your father
had you arrested.

01:02:31.331 --> 01:02:33.083
- Objection.
- Ms. Wood.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:36.420
Asefa, did you ever steal
anything from your father?

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:38.505
- Never.
- Did you ever hit him

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:40.841
- or try to hurt him physically?
- No.

01:02:40.841 --> 01:02:42.342
And you had a right
to be in his home.

01:02:42.342 --> 01:02:43.635
You weren't trespassing,
were you?

01:02:43.635 --> 01:02:45.762
- No.
- Oh.

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:48.265
We've ruled out
larceny and battery.

01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:52.269
Asefa, this is your warrant,

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:55.647
which the government attorney
so helpfully procured.

01:02:55.647 --> 01:02:57.566
Will you read the charge?

01:02:59.317 --> 01:03:02.821
- "Crimes against God."
- Mm-hm.

01:03:02.821 --> 01:03:05.323
Asefa, what do you think
those crimes were

01:03:05.323 --> 01:03:07.451
for which you needed
to be taught a lesson?

01:03:07.451 --> 01:03:09.536
- Objection.
- I will allow it.

01:03:09.536 --> 01:03:13.790
Trying to be
an independent woman.

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:15.709
Teaching girls to read.

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:19.755
Asefa, I want to remind you

01:03:19.755 --> 01:03:22.466
that you are under oath
to tell the whole truth

01:03:22.466 --> 01:03:25.635
and nothing but the truth.

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:27.554
Are you ready to do that?

01:03:28.722 --> 01:03:30.223
I am.

01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:34.311
Asefa,

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:38.398
were you injured in any way
during the demonstration?

01:03:38.398 --> 01:03:40.442
No.

01:03:40.442 --> 01:03:42.235
When were you injured?

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:47.240
In jail.

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:53.080
At night, after my arrest.

01:03:55.374 --> 01:03:59.920
Three Taliban
beat me in my cell.

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.505
Are you sure?

01:04:01.505 --> 01:04:03.423
- Because you didn't remember...
- I remember it.

01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:10.263
Earlier they vandalized
the classroom,

01:04:10.263 --> 01:04:13.809
and now they brought in
some books.

01:04:13.809 --> 01:04:16.520
My mother's books.

01:04:17.604 --> 01:04:19.272
And some textbooks I bought.

01:04:20.691 --> 01:04:22.150
What happened next?

01:04:23.652 --> 01:04:25.737
They hit me with them.

01:04:26.822 --> 01:04:29.449
In my ribs.

01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:30.867
My head.

01:04:34.204 --> 01:04:37.624
They tore out pages
and stuffed them in my mouth.

01:04:39.793 --> 01:04:40.752
Then they...

01:04:43.588 --> 01:04:46.633
They put their fingers in me.

01:04:50.637 --> 01:04:53.432
And... the rest.

01:04:59.855 --> 01:05:02.315
They took turns all night.

01:05:03.692 --> 01:05:05.152
They raped me.

01:05:10.741 --> 01:05:12.784
And you remember this now.

01:05:12.784 --> 01:05:14.703
I remember everything.

01:05:19.708 --> 01:05:21.877
Thank you, Asefa.

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:24.755
Miss Ashwari.

01:05:26.715 --> 01:05:30.344
You say now you remember
everything that happened?

01:05:30.344 --> 01:05:31.678
Yes.

01:05:31.678 --> 01:05:33.388
But before, you said
you had memory loss.

01:05:33.388 --> 01:05:34.848
Yes.

01:05:34.848 --> 01:05:37.851
You testified in this court
you had memory loss.

01:05:37.851 --> 01:05:39.353
Yes.

01:05:39.353 --> 01:05:41.938
Did you ever tell anyone
your story before today?

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:43.565
No.

01:05:43.565 --> 01:05:45.776
You told everyone
you couldn't remember.

01:05:45.776 --> 01:05:47.361
Yes.

01:05:47.402 --> 01:05:48.612
Your father too?
Your brothers?

01:05:48.612 --> 01:05:49.821
Yes.

01:05:49.821 --> 01:05:52.866
Did you really have
memory loss?

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:56.953
No. I always remembered
everything.

01:05:56.953 --> 01:06:00.916
And yet, you told me,
the immigration official,

01:06:00.916 --> 01:06:02.918
your lawyer,
all those people,

01:06:02.918 --> 01:06:05.504
you told you had memory loss,

01:06:05.504 --> 01:06:07.923
but in fact you were lying.

01:06:10.592 --> 01:06:11.718
Yes.

01:06:11.718 --> 01:06:14.012
All those times
you were lying.

01:06:14.012 --> 01:06:15.681
Yes.

01:06:15.681 --> 01:06:18.266
You lied very well.

01:06:20.519 --> 01:06:24.314
So how do I know
you're not lying now?

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:26.608
I'm telling the truth.

01:06:28.443 --> 01:06:33.532
I want to believe you,
but I'm bothered by something.

01:06:33.532 --> 01:06:36.952
Your hospital report
after your arrest

01:06:36.952 --> 01:06:39.079
mentions all those injuries...

01:06:39.121 --> 01:06:41.957
the bruised ribs,
the concussion...

01:06:41.957 --> 01:06:43.917
it doesn't say you were raped.

01:06:43.959 --> 01:06:46.378
I wouldn't let them look.

01:06:46.378 --> 01:06:49.631
Don't you think
that's awfully convenient?

01:06:49.631 --> 01:06:51.967
The one injury
you could not have gotten

01:06:51.967 --> 01:06:53.802
from being hit by a rock.

01:06:53.802 --> 01:06:56.555
The one thing that would prove

01:06:56.555 --> 01:07:00.100
that you were hurt by the police
and not by the bystanders,

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.769
you chose to hide.

01:07:02.769 --> 01:07:05.564
In fact, you lied about it
to anyone who asked.

01:07:05.564 --> 01:07:08.817
Would have kept on lying had
your lawyer not convinced you

01:07:08.817 --> 01:07:12.446
that was the only way
you were gonna win this trial.

01:07:12.446 --> 01:07:14.948
Why...

01:07:14.948 --> 01:07:17.576
Why'd you wait so long?

01:07:17.576 --> 01:07:21.747
Why didn't you tell the truth
right away?

01:07:21.747 --> 01:07:23.749
Why did you keep lying?

01:07:23.749 --> 01:07:25.792
My brothers
would have killed me.

01:07:29.671 --> 01:07:32.007
Ms. Wood?

01:07:32.007 --> 01:07:36.136
Asefa's father
is a tribal leader.

01:07:36.136 --> 01:07:39.598
With Asefa testifying
about what really happened,

01:07:39.598 --> 01:07:41.600
making it public,

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.602
her male relatives
become duty-bound

01:07:43.602 --> 01:07:46.605
to protect their family honor
and kill her.

01:07:46.605 --> 01:07:48.774
Do you have anything
in your exhibits

01:07:48.774 --> 01:07:50.108
to corroborate this claim?

01:07:50.108 --> 01:07:51.610
I do.

01:07:53.904 --> 01:07:56.114
If you'll give me a moment.

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:10.712
Is counsel prepared at all?

01:08:12.923 --> 01:08:16.176
Your Honor, based on
the state department report,

01:08:16.176 --> 01:08:20.138
honor killings often occur
in that particular region.

01:08:20.138 --> 01:08:23.392
Thank you, Benjamin.
I've heard enough.

01:08:24.559 --> 01:08:26.060
Your witness.

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:28.563
Your Honor,
no further questions.

01:08:31.441 --> 01:08:33.819
The government rests.

01:08:38.115 --> 01:08:39.616
Okay.

01:08:43.203 --> 01:08:45.580
I am ready to rule.

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:52.462
Miss Ashwari,

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:56.675
I believe you told the truth
in this courtroom today.

01:08:56.675 --> 01:08:59.176
I believe your testimony.

01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:01.846
I believe you were persecuted

01:09:01.846 --> 01:09:05.183
by officials
of the Afghan government,

01:09:05.183 --> 01:09:09.604
and that after a demonstration
you led in your village,

01:09:09.604 --> 01:09:15.109
you were arrested, beaten,
and raped by the police.

01:09:17.029 --> 01:09:19.698
You've had to endure so much.

01:09:21.491 --> 01:09:24.953
I'm horrified
by how you were treated.

01:09:26.621 --> 01:09:28.540
I'm impressed by your strength.

01:09:30.751 --> 01:09:35.464
You, young lady,
are an admirable human being.

01:09:39.176 --> 01:09:43.971
I wish I could grant
your plea of asylum,

01:09:43.971 --> 01:09:48.643
but my hands
are tied by the law.

01:09:48.643 --> 01:09:52.064
The Law of Asylum
does not recognize women

01:09:52.064 --> 01:09:53.939
as a protected class.

01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:59.654
Ethnic minorities,
religious minorities,

01:09:59.654 --> 01:10:04.826
political dissidents, yes,
but not women.

01:10:04.826 --> 01:10:08.914
It's not enough
just to be a woman.

01:10:08.914 --> 01:10:11.833
There are thousands of cases
like yours.

01:10:11.833 --> 01:10:13.585
Thousands.

01:10:15.212 --> 01:10:20.258
And as a woman,
I applaud you.

01:10:20.258 --> 01:10:25.013
As a judge,
I must rule against you.

01:10:39.695 --> 01:10:42.906
They'll kill her.
They will.

01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:30.912
How was your sleepover?

01:11:32.956 --> 01:11:35.834
Dad wants me to go live with him
all the time.

01:11:40.047 --> 01:11:41.590
Is that what you want?

01:12:17.167 --> 01:12:19.211
Count time!

01:12:19.211 --> 01:12:20.796
Count time!

01:12:22.756 --> 01:12:28.011
On your racks,
legs crossed, arms out.

01:12:28.011 --> 01:12:30.138
<i>Stay in place
during the count.</i>

01:12:35.102 --> 01:12:38.188
<i>C4, return to your block
for roll call.</i>

01:12:39.398 --> 01:12:40.691
Clear!

01:12:57.916 --> 01:12:59.793
Yes, I have my pillow.

01:12:59.793 --> 01:13:02.462
Okay, we're about to eat.
I gotta go.

01:13:02.462 --> 01:13:04.006
Love you too.

01:13:07.092 --> 01:13:09.386
<i>Okay. Comer.</i>

01:13:16.768 --> 01:13:19.187
Please watch over Alex,
our guest.

01:13:19.187 --> 01:13:22.774
Please watch over
Tomasito and Sofia,

01:13:22.774 --> 01:13:29.740
and please, please, help Judy
bring their father home soon.

01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:30.907
Amen.

01:13:41.084 --> 01:13:42.919
Bourbon, neat.

01:13:44.421 --> 01:13:47.090
It's a cash bar.

01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:51.762
Not a lot of perks championing
the huddled masses, are there?

01:13:51.762 --> 01:13:54.348
You know why
I gave you that case?

01:13:54.348 --> 01:13:57.309
I didn't give it to you
so you could help her.

01:13:57.309 --> 01:13:59.978
I gave it to help you.

01:13:59.978 --> 01:14:02.439
So you could make friends
for later.

01:14:02.439 --> 01:14:05.400
She deserved
a hell of a lot better.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.486
And you didn't give it to me.

01:14:07.486 --> 01:14:10.072
Judy, you know that phrase

01:14:10.113 --> 01:14:12.783
"truth, justice,
and the American way?"

01:14:12.783 --> 01:14:14.284
You know why it's like that?

01:14:14.284 --> 01:14:16.411
Because they are
three separate things.

01:14:16.411 --> 01:14:18.497
Sometimes they come together,
but you can't count on it.

01:14:18.497 --> 01:14:20.374
Oh, that's one hell
of a bedside manner.

01:14:20.374 --> 01:14:21.875
Is that what you tell
all your clients, Ray?

01:14:21.875 --> 01:14:23.293
They know.

01:14:23.293 --> 01:14:26.421
My clients drink tequila,
not the Kool-Aid.

01:14:26.421 --> 01:14:27.881
The one thing
you have to understand...

01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:29.174
Ms. Wood,

01:14:29.174 --> 01:14:31.301
I hope you don't
mind me saying this.

01:14:31.301 --> 01:14:33.929
It was a privilege to be
with you in that courtroom.

01:14:33.929 --> 01:14:35.097
You tried a good case.

01:14:35.097 --> 01:14:36.223
Hello, I'm...

01:14:36.223 --> 01:14:37.891
I know who you are.

01:14:37.891 --> 01:14:39.893
You're the rising star,

01:14:39.893 --> 01:14:41.436
climbing up the ladder.

01:14:41.436 --> 01:14:43.271
So what's next for you?

01:14:43.271 --> 01:14:44.856
Assistant DA?

01:14:44.856 --> 01:14:47.025
Or are you one of those
federal judge types?

01:14:47.025 --> 01:14:49.820
Oh, leave him alone, Ray.

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:51.321
He's one of the good ones.

01:14:51.321 --> 01:14:53.448
Wait, you're not
Ray Hernandez, are you?

01:14:53.448 --> 01:14:54.991
<i>INS vs. Ladha?</i>

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:57.327
You convinced
three hostile judges

01:14:57.327 --> 01:14:59.162
that refugees
fleeing a war zone

01:14:59.162 --> 01:15:01.331
could be forgiven
for misplacing their passports.

01:15:01.331 --> 01:15:02.833
I cited that one
twice this week.

01:15:02.833 --> 01:15:05.127
You don't argue cases
anymore, do you?

01:15:05.127 --> 01:15:06.545
I was a different person then.

01:15:06.545 --> 01:15:08.338
That is a tragedy.

01:15:08.338 --> 01:15:10.090
Fuck off, Atticus Finch.

01:15:11.383 --> 01:15:13.343
On that note...

01:15:13.343 --> 01:15:16.013
- Are you okay?
- It's been a tough day.

01:15:16.013 --> 01:15:17.472
Why don't you find
Ms. Wood a taxi?

01:15:17.472 --> 01:15:19.266
I'd rather walk.

01:15:19.266 --> 01:15:21.977
It was an honor to meet you.

01:15:23.437 --> 01:15:27.315
And I alone was left alive
to tell the tale.

01:15:55.427 --> 01:15:57.054
I'll see you in court.

01:16:44.101 --> 01:16:45.727
Hey.

01:16:45.727 --> 01:16:47.354
What are you doing here?

01:16:47.354 --> 01:16:48.563
I was just driving
home from Mammoth.

01:16:48.563 --> 01:16:50.482
I stopped here to take a leak.

01:16:50.482 --> 01:16:53.694
I don't know if you saw it,
but they're kicking us out.

01:16:53.694 --> 01:16:55.654
I'm hungry.

01:16:57.239 --> 01:17:00.742
Give me ketchup.
I want ketchup.

01:17:00.742 --> 01:17:04.454
I want to bathe in ketchup.

01:17:04.454 --> 01:17:08.125
All that's open
is gonna be Chinese.

01:17:08.125 --> 01:17:10.252
Chinese, it is.

01:17:20.178 --> 01:17:24.599
Okay, I don't know how
you do it, Judy. You...

01:17:24.599 --> 01:17:26.685
You have like a hundred cases.

01:17:26.685 --> 01:17:28.645
276.

01:17:28.645 --> 01:17:30.313
Exactly, okay?

01:17:30.313 --> 01:17:33.025
And each one,
you listen to their stories,

01:17:33.025 --> 01:17:35.152
and you meet their kids.

01:17:35.152 --> 01:17:38.989
You fight like
it's your life at stake.

01:17:40.615 --> 01:17:43.326
I've grown up watching
my dad, you know,

01:17:43.326 --> 01:17:45.787
the king of commercial
construction legal,

01:17:45.787 --> 01:17:47.581
and he's got the practice,

01:17:47.581 --> 01:17:50.625
and he's got the beach house
and the ridiculous cars

01:17:50.625 --> 01:17:52.377
and the stuff that...

01:17:52.377 --> 01:17:55.339
all the stuff that you obviously
don't give a shit about.

01:17:56.757 --> 01:17:58.759
I'm not that noble.

01:17:58.759 --> 01:18:01.094
I want a car with an engine.

01:18:03.221 --> 01:18:05.724
From him,
I learned that clients

01:18:05.724 --> 01:18:08.352
are a way to get the things
that he really wants.

01:18:08.352 --> 01:18:13.148
But for you, it's like clients
are the only thing that matters.

01:18:13.148 --> 01:18:15.275
Did you know that
in two-thirds of the world,

01:18:15.275 --> 01:18:18.445
being a woman who thinks
is a crime?

01:18:19.696 --> 01:18:21.406
These women are broken,

01:18:21.406 --> 01:18:23.742
and I'm not talking
about their bones.

01:18:23.742 --> 01:18:26.453
I'm talking about
their spirit.

01:18:26.453 --> 01:18:28.455
Yeah.

01:18:28.455 --> 01:18:31.458
And a person
who has a broken spirit...

01:18:35.462 --> 01:18:37.381
that's why I fight.

01:19:04.408 --> 01:19:05.826
- Omar.
- Hi, Judy.

01:19:05.826 --> 01:19:07.077
Hi.

01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:11.748
How can I help you?

01:19:11.790 --> 01:19:15.419
What kind of judge
thinks like this?

01:19:15.419 --> 01:19:18.505
A very highly respected one.

01:19:18.505 --> 01:19:21.341
Asefa told me everything.

01:19:21.341 --> 01:19:23.468
I was wrong about you.

01:19:23.468 --> 01:19:25.470
You're a good lawyer.

01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:27.431
A great lawyer.

01:19:29.474 --> 01:19:31.601
Please, take this.

01:19:31.601 --> 01:19:34.771
Omar, Ray is your lawyer.

01:19:34.771 --> 01:19:36.523
This is for Asefa.

01:19:36.523 --> 01:19:38.692
You haven't been paid anything
for all your work.

01:19:38.692 --> 01:19:40.694
I knew that
when I accepted the case,

01:19:40.694 --> 01:19:42.571
and you need this money
to pay Ray.

01:19:46.867 --> 01:19:49.161
No more legal fees.

01:19:50.537 --> 01:19:52.748
The court refused
to hear my appeal.

01:19:56.543 --> 01:19:59.838
I'm going to disappear.
I'm not going back.

01:19:59.838 --> 01:20:01.673
But you could.

01:20:01.673 --> 01:20:03.675
You could still have
a life there.

01:20:03.675 --> 01:20:05.510
No.

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:13.560
I was also arrested
for crimes against God.

01:20:16.688 --> 01:20:19.232
So you see,

01:20:19.232 --> 01:20:21.443
I know what she went through.

01:20:23.362 --> 01:20:25.280
I know exactly.

01:20:26.698 --> 01:20:30.327
Everything they did to her,

01:20:30.327 --> 01:20:32.621
they did to me.

01:20:34.664 --> 01:20:37.459
I know your case.
You never testified...

01:20:37.459 --> 01:20:39.711
And I never will.

01:20:39.711 --> 01:20:41.713
Ever.

01:20:41.713 --> 01:20:46.343
Is that what
you were saying to Asefa?

01:20:46.343 --> 01:20:48.303
To stay silent?

01:20:49.471 --> 01:20:50.722
Yes.

01:20:53.433 --> 01:20:56.395
But Asefa is stronger than me.

01:20:56.395 --> 01:20:59.398
And now she will be deported

01:20:59.398 --> 01:21:02.401
to be killed by her father
and her brothers.

01:21:02.401 --> 01:21:03.944
You lost the case.

01:21:03.944 --> 01:21:05.737
She'll lose her life,

01:21:05.737 --> 01:21:08.407
and her blood
will be on your hands,

01:21:08.407 --> 01:21:10.826
unless you do something.

01:21:27.968 --> 01:21:29.678
Did you hear that?

01:21:29.678 --> 01:21:32.514
Enough, yeah.

01:21:32.514 --> 01:21:33.515
He was raped.

01:21:33.515 --> 01:21:35.267
Yes, yes.

01:21:35.267 --> 01:21:36.309
Jesus Christ.

01:21:37.602 --> 01:21:40.939
Just like Asefa,
and for the same reason.

01:21:40.939 --> 01:21:44.317
She wasn't raped
for being a woman,

01:21:44.317 --> 01:21:46.611
She just happened
to be a woman.

01:21:46.611 --> 01:21:48.613
She was raped
because she was a threat.

01:21:50.574 --> 01:21:53.660
The Law of Asylum doesn't
specifically protect women,

01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:55.537
but they didn't do it
because she was a woman.

01:21:55.537 --> 01:21:57.289
They did it
because she was dangerous.

01:21:57.289 --> 01:21:59.291
They raped Asefa
because she voiced

01:21:59.291 --> 01:22:00.792
unpopular political opinions.

01:22:00.792 --> 01:22:02.627
- About women.
- No, that doesn't matter.

01:22:02.627 --> 01:22:05.547
The law covers
all unpopular views.

01:22:05.547 --> 01:22:07.382
- So the judge was wrong.
- Very wrong.

01:22:09.009 --> 01:22:10.802
We have a compelling basis
for an appeal.

01:22:10.802 --> 01:22:13.722
We just need a rock-solid brief
for the Ninth Circuit.

01:22:13.722 --> 01:22:15.766
Judy, I start working
for my dad on Monday.

01:22:15.766 --> 01:22:17.726
- We need to look at every case.
- Or not.

01:22:17.726 --> 01:22:20.312
Every administrative advisory,

01:22:20.312 --> 01:22:22.314
every legislative commentary.

01:22:22.314 --> 01:22:24.441
- I'm on it.
- Okay.

01:22:27.486 --> 01:22:28.487
This is it.

01:22:36.703 --> 01:22:38.246
We got the appeal.

01:22:40.707 --> 01:22:42.542
We got the appeal.

01:22:42.542 --> 01:22:43.835
This is good news.

01:22:43.835 --> 01:22:45.337
Yes!

01:22:45.337 --> 01:22:47.589
Yes. We have one last chance.

01:22:50.759 --> 01:22:52.678
That's absurd,
absolutely absurd.

01:22:53.887 --> 01:22:56.348
Hey, buddy,
let me call you back.

01:22:56.348 --> 01:22:58.433
Why hasn't my client
been released?

01:22:58.433 --> 01:23:00.352
Has the government accepted
all the facts of your case?

01:23:00.352 --> 01:23:02.354
We had an entire trial
about this,

01:23:02.354 --> 01:23:04.481
and the judge believes her.

01:23:07.025 --> 01:23:09.653
- I need this document signed.
- Oh, come on!

01:23:09.653 --> 01:23:11.279
I need sign-off.

01:23:12.364 --> 01:23:13.699
Come with me.

01:23:32.884 --> 01:23:33.927
Ms. Wood.

01:23:33.927 --> 01:23:35.637
Miss Ashwari.

01:23:35.637 --> 01:23:36.555
Benjamin.

01:23:38.890 --> 01:23:42.519
If we are gonna
release this detainee,

01:23:42.519 --> 01:23:43.979
it's your call.

01:23:47.983 --> 01:23:49.609
Have a seat, please.

01:23:58.035 --> 01:24:00.871
When I started here,
we were called INS,

01:24:00.871 --> 01:24:04.708
Immigration
and Naturalization Service.

01:24:04.708 --> 01:24:06.752
We were a service.

01:24:08.086 --> 01:24:12.090
After 9-11,
they changed the name

01:24:12.090 --> 01:24:16.011
to ICE, ice,

01:24:16.011 --> 01:24:19.765
Immigration
and Customs Enforcement,

01:24:19.765 --> 01:24:22.893
a name that equates
people to things.

01:24:24.686 --> 01:24:26.772
We're not a service anymore.

01:24:28.774 --> 01:24:30.567
Words matter.

01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:37.991
We're a nation of immigrants.

01:24:37.991 --> 01:24:40.827
Like Albert Einstein,
like Fernando Valenzuela,

01:24:40.827 --> 01:24:44.039
like my father.

01:24:44.039 --> 01:24:46.625
They all come to the vineyard.

01:24:46.625 --> 01:24:49.378
Some welcome, some not.

01:24:50.754 --> 01:24:53.548
Some didn't even choose
to come here.

01:24:55.467 --> 01:24:58.595
My job is to uphold the law.

01:25:20.992 --> 01:25:23.537
It's a beautiful day.

01:25:23.537 --> 01:25:25.998
We don't get many of these
around here.

01:25:30.502 --> 01:25:32.129
Thank you, Benjamin.

01:25:54.151 --> 01:25:57.279
- Hey, sport.
- Hi, Dad.

01:25:57.279 --> 01:26:00.615
- You helping pack up?
- Yeah.

01:26:00.615 --> 01:26:02.034
- You're a good man.
- Thanks.

01:26:02.075 --> 01:26:05.245
You know, I always wanted him
to live with me.

01:26:05.245 --> 01:26:07.539
How noble of you.

01:26:09.249 --> 01:26:11.501
Al, why don't you come give me
a hand outside with this.

01:26:17.591 --> 01:26:19.593
Judy, when I asked you
to move here,

01:26:19.593 --> 01:26:21.720
I didn't expect you
to actually do it.

01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:23.847
Alex should know his father.

01:26:23.847 --> 01:26:26.725
Well, I don't think
he's gonna be disappointed.

01:26:26.725 --> 01:26:28.727
You think it's gonna be
so easy being a dad.

01:26:28.727 --> 01:26:32.564
When my day is over,
I forget all about my clients.

01:26:32.564 --> 01:26:34.983
I can go home and devote
everything I have to Alex.

01:26:34.983 --> 01:26:37.569
But you? You bring
everything home with you.

01:26:37.569 --> 01:26:39.654
What does that leave him?

01:26:39.654 --> 01:26:41.656
He's never had all your love

01:26:41.656 --> 01:26:44.326
because you save it
for your clients.

01:26:44.326 --> 01:26:47.746
He sees it.
He can feel it in his heart

01:26:47.788 --> 01:26:50.791
that he can never
have all of you.

01:26:51.958 --> 01:26:53.960
And neither could I.

01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:55.837
There it is.

01:26:57.589 --> 01:26:58.924
There it is.

01:26:58.965 --> 01:27:01.093
But your criminals
and those immigrants...

01:27:01.093 --> 01:27:03.595
Shame on you.

01:27:03.637 --> 01:27:06.306
I am the only one
that they can count on.

01:27:06.306 --> 01:27:08.850
Oh, Saint Judy.

01:27:08.850 --> 01:27:10.852
You know why
they call you that?

01:27:10.852 --> 01:27:13.271
It's not because
you are a saint.

01:27:13.271 --> 01:27:16.233
It's because you act like one.

01:27:16.233 --> 01:27:18.610
They're just clients,

01:27:18.610 --> 01:27:21.363
and I want mine to pay me.

01:27:21.363 --> 01:27:24.032
You want yours to save you.

01:27:35.168 --> 01:27:37.921
- That's the courthouse?
- Yes.

01:27:37.921 --> 01:27:41.842
- It looks like a palace.
- It is, kind of.

01:27:43.385 --> 01:27:46.638
Won't these judges
say the same thing?

01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:49.016
In court,
there are no guarantees.

01:27:50.350 --> 01:27:52.310
If you want to disappear
like Omar,

01:27:52.352 --> 01:27:54.813
I'm not going to stop you.

01:27:56.690 --> 01:27:59.109
But what about all those
other women like me?

01:27:59.109 --> 01:28:03.655
Will they be sent back
to die?

01:28:09.036 --> 01:28:11.246
What would you do in my place?

01:28:11.246 --> 01:28:14.374
I can't even begin to imagine.

01:28:14.374 --> 01:28:17.085
I'm so much luckier
than you are.

01:28:18.712 --> 01:28:20.714
Because you were
born in America.

01:28:20.714 --> 01:28:22.883
Yes.

01:28:22.883 --> 01:28:26.053
Because of where
I happened to be born.

01:28:32.225 --> 01:28:35.062
Do you know
what the difference is?

01:28:36.355 --> 01:28:38.231
I was thrown in jail
in Afghanistan,

01:28:38.231 --> 01:28:40.400
I was thrown in jail here.

01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:44.863
There, they beat me
and took my womanhood.

01:28:44.863 --> 01:28:47.908
Here, they pumped me
full of drugs

01:28:47.908 --> 01:28:50.243
and took my mind.

01:28:50.243 --> 01:28:52.662
Took away years of my life.

01:28:54.081 --> 01:28:56.750
In both countries,
people hate me

01:28:56.750 --> 01:28:58.669
and want me to go away.

01:29:02.089 --> 01:29:05.634
But in America,
I can fight back.

01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:28.448
I need a sponsor to be
admitted to the Ninth Circuit.

01:29:30.325 --> 01:29:31.785
What an honor.

01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:46.341
Well, you showed me.

01:29:46.341 --> 01:29:49.094
You took an ugly duckling
right from under my nose,

01:29:49.094 --> 01:29:52.389
and you made it
a beautiful swan.

01:29:54.182 --> 01:29:55.809
I hope the Ninth Circuit

01:29:55.809 --> 01:29:57.894
don't make her fly south
for the winter.

01:29:57.894 --> 01:30:00.105
Thank you for your wishes, Ray.

01:30:00.105 --> 01:30:02.149
So smug.

01:30:06.319 --> 01:30:10.115
You know even if you win,
you lose.

01:30:11.992 --> 01:30:14.244
Everybody... everybody...

01:30:14.244 --> 01:30:18.165
is gonna want
a miracle from you.

01:30:18.165 --> 01:30:20.167
You can't save them all.

01:30:20.167 --> 01:30:22.461
I can try.

01:30:25.797 --> 01:30:29.009
You know who you remind me of?

01:30:29.009 --> 01:30:31.178
Me.

01:30:31.178 --> 01:30:33.805
Before I realized I had to put
two kids through college.

01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:40.937
- You should come.
- I wish I could.

01:30:40.937 --> 01:30:42.481
Too busy.

01:30:42.481 --> 01:30:45.192
I'll read the decision
if they bother to publish.

01:30:48.028 --> 01:30:48.987
Judy.

01:30:53.533 --> 01:30:54.951
Good luck.

01:31:27.275 --> 01:31:30.320
Hello, Mr. Nunez.
This is Ray Hernandez.

01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:33.073
I'm calling because
I've been going over your file,

01:31:33.073 --> 01:31:37.327
and I think I found something
that I may have overlooked.

01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:42.040
There's hope.

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:45.252
So call me.
I'll be at the office late.

01:31:45.252 --> 01:31:46.420
Thank you.

01:34:04.725 --> 01:34:06.309
Yes, go on through.

01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:53.440
He insisted I bring him.

01:34:58.528 --> 01:34:59.780
TTNBTT.

01:35:01.073 --> 01:35:02.491
And nothing but.

01:35:02.491 --> 01:35:04.659
<i>Ashwari vs. United States.</i>

01:35:08.330 --> 01:35:09.748
Come see what we did.

01:35:42.364 --> 01:35:43.740
Sorry. There was a long line.

01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:47.327
I got, uh, carne asada,
extra ketchup.

01:36:17.232 --> 01:36:18.442
Hear ye, hear ye!

01:36:18.442 --> 01:36:21.069
Please be up
standing for the judges.

01:36:30.203 --> 01:36:31.663
Be seated.

01:36:34.166 --> 01:36:35.751
<i>Is this
Ashwari vs. United States?</i>

01:36:35.751 --> 01:36:37.336
Yes, I believe so.

01:36:37.336 --> 01:36:39.463
Here it is. Thank you.

01:36:46.428 --> 01:36:48.430
May it please the court.

01:36:48.430 --> 01:36:52.601
I'm Judy Wood, representing
the appellant, Asefa Ashwari.

01:36:52.601 --> 01:36:54.353
Are we supposed to grant asylum

01:36:54.353 --> 01:36:57.397
to every persecuted woman
anywhere?

01:36:57.397 --> 01:37:00.484
We should, definitely,

01:37:00.484 --> 01:37:03.278
in my personal opinion,
as a country.

01:37:03.278 --> 01:37:05.655
But that is not
the question before you.

01:37:05.655 --> 01:37:07.783
The question before you

01:37:07.783 --> 01:37:10.369
is that if a woman
fights for her rights,

01:37:10.369 --> 01:37:12.621
doesn't that count as politics?

01:37:12.621 --> 01:37:14.623
And if the Law of Asylum
excludes that,

01:37:14.623 --> 01:37:16.416
where does it precisely say so?

01:37:16.416 --> 01:37:17.918
Does it have to?

01:37:17.918 --> 01:37:20.212
It expressly applies
to minorities,

01:37:20.212 --> 01:37:22.547
and women are
one half the population.

01:37:22.547 --> 01:37:24.549
The law applies
to persecuted groups.

01:37:24.549 --> 01:37:27.552
Even large majorities
can be persecuted,

01:37:27.552 --> 01:37:29.638
in apartheid
South Africa, for example.

01:37:29.638 --> 01:37:32.974
Ah, but it was passed pursuant
to an international treaty

01:37:32.974 --> 01:37:35.352
and signed by many countries
who define women's rights

01:37:35.352 --> 01:37:36.687
differently from us.

01:37:36.687 --> 01:37:38.313
Now, would they have done it

01:37:38.313 --> 01:37:40.315
if it were seen
as a grab for their women?

01:37:40.315 --> 01:37:43.485
"Come on over here, babe!
You're persecuted!"

01:37:43.485 --> 01:37:46.488
They can rest assured that
Miss Ashwari was not lured here.

01:37:46.488 --> 01:37:49.241
She came of her own free will,

01:37:49.241 --> 01:37:52.452
and she pleads not to be sent
back to an almost certain death.

01:37:52.452 --> 01:37:55.580
If I may, I think
my colleague's point is,

01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:58.792
the law protects only
the victims of persecution.

01:37:58.792 --> 01:38:01.878
It explicitly does not
protect the persecutors.

01:38:01.878 --> 01:38:04.339
And in the instant case,
didn't appellant herself

01:38:04.339 --> 01:38:07.551
testify that the girls' mothers
kept them away from the school?

01:38:07.551 --> 01:38:11.930
So were they the persecutors
or the persecuted?

01:38:11.930 --> 01:38:14.808
Miss Ashwari was not arrested,
beaten and raped

01:38:14.808 --> 01:38:16.351
because she's a woman.

01:38:16.351 --> 01:38:18.478
She was arrested,
beaten and raped

01:38:18.478 --> 01:38:21.356
for speaking out
on behalf of women,

01:38:21.356 --> 01:38:23.650
for organizing a demonstration,

01:38:23.650 --> 01:38:25.652
for being a political activist.

01:38:25.652 --> 01:38:28.321
Did she see herself
as a political activist?

01:38:28.321 --> 01:38:30.032
I don't know, Your Honor.

01:38:30.032 --> 01:38:32.451
She saw herself
as a teacher of girls.

01:38:32.451 --> 01:38:33.744
Was she a member
of a political party?

01:38:33.744 --> 01:38:35.037
No.

01:38:35.037 --> 01:38:36.538
Did she run for office?

01:38:36.538 --> 01:38:38.498
Did she distribute pamphlets?

01:38:38.498 --> 01:38:41.460
Did she write letters
to her local paper?

01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:43.837
Was she political in any way?

01:38:43.837 --> 01:38:46.548
Your Honor, that is not
the question before you.

01:38:46.548 --> 01:38:48.717
The Law of Asylum
is quite clear on this.

01:38:48.717 --> 01:38:51.386
It is not how the victim
sees herself,

01:38:51.386 --> 01:38:53.513
but how the persecutors
see the victim.

01:38:53.513 --> 01:38:55.307
If they consider it politics,

01:38:55.307 --> 01:38:56.850
then she's protected
by the law.

01:38:56.850 --> 01:38:58.810
And did they in this case?

01:38:58.810 --> 01:39:00.645
Without question, Your Honors.

01:39:00.645 --> 01:39:04.399
Miss Ashwari was not persecuted
randomly for being a woman.

01:39:04.399 --> 01:39:07.319
She was specifically targeted
for what she stood for.

01:39:07.319 --> 01:39:09.738
A warrant was issued
by the government

01:39:09.738 --> 01:39:13.408
for her arrest
for crimes against God.

01:39:13.408 --> 01:39:15.786
The Taliban
had enacted into law

01:39:15.786 --> 01:39:17.954
a twisted version of Islam.

01:39:17.954 --> 01:39:20.582
It was this law
that the police were enforcing

01:39:20.582 --> 01:39:22.751
by beating and raping her,

01:39:22.751 --> 01:39:25.462
which, by the way, is
tantamount to a death sentence

01:39:25.462 --> 01:39:28.090
in an area
rife with honor killings.

01:39:28.090 --> 01:39:32.552
It is that law that Miss Ashwari
opposed with her actions,

01:39:32.552 --> 01:39:34.596
with her teachings,
with her love,

01:39:34.596 --> 01:39:36.765
with every fiber of her being.

01:39:36.807 --> 01:39:38.350
As a woman,
as her mother's daughter,

01:39:38.350 --> 01:39:39.726
as a teacher of girls,

01:39:39.726 --> 01:39:43.980
she was the definition
of a political activist.

01:39:52.948 --> 01:39:57.119
Ms. Wood, you are asking us
to reverse an opinion

01:39:57.119 --> 01:39:59.746
of not just
one respected judge,

01:39:59.746 --> 01:40:02.791
but of every judge
who decided a similar case.

01:40:02.791 --> 01:40:05.877
The law does not protect women
as a class,

01:40:05.877 --> 01:40:08.463
but it shouldn't
sacrifice us either.

01:40:08.463 --> 01:40:11.466
So all those judges,
every one of them, are wrong.

01:40:11.466 --> 01:40:13.802
Yes, all those judges are wrong.

01:40:16.054 --> 01:40:18.432
But you don't have to be.

01:40:53.508 --> 01:40:54.509
Hi.

01:41:20.577 --> 01:41:23.830
Hello, this is Judy Wood.
How may I help you?
