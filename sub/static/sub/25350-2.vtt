WEBVTT

00:10.811 --> 00:14.012
He's fixated on making
people zombies.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.948
He overwhelms them.

00:15.950 --> 00:17.883
He was trying
to take over my body.

00:17.885 --> 00:19.951
You can't be comfortable
bringing your kids here.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.220
I'm not.

00:21.222 --> 00:25.157
Your soul is battling
against the darkness.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.291
It's a demon.

00:26.293 --> 00:29.628
It's Satan.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.363
This is true evil.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.700
It doesn't end well here

00:35.702 --> 00:38.370
and I just feel fear.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.505
My name is Amy Allan.

00:40.507 --> 00:43.842
This is like Grand Central
Station for the dead.

00:43.844 --> 00:44.976
I see dead people.

00:44.978 --> 00:47.179
They have pain
that they suffered.

00:47.181 --> 00:49.181
I speak to dead people.

00:49.183 --> 00:51.983
She hates them, hates them.

00:51.985 --> 00:55.921
And they speak to me,
but there's only one way to know

00:55.923 --> 00:57.656
if my findings are real.

00:57.658 --> 00:58.991
It's a demon.

00:58.993 --> 01:01.259
It's Satan.

01:01.261 --> 01:02.794
I rely on my partner.

01:02.796 --> 01:04.396
I'm Steve DiSchiavi.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.598
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:06.600 --> 01:07.933
What was the body count?
What happened?

01:07.935 --> 01:11.737
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.004
I don't know
if it's a demon or not,

01:13.006 --> 01:14.673
but it sure as hell
looks like one.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.275
It's my job to reveal them.

01:16.277 --> 01:18.743
I feel like I'm crazy.

01:18.745 --> 01:20.612
But Steve and I never speak...

01:20.614 --> 01:22.614
We never communicate
during and investigation.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.149
...until the very end.

01:24.151 --> 01:25.984
All right.
I want to show you this.

01:25.986 --> 01:28.286
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

01:28.288 --> 01:30.622
I just don't want anything
to happen to my mother.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.223
...or time to get out.

01:32.225 --> 01:33.826
You have to get out.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:47.775 --> 01:49.574
So I'm out here
in Gatesville, Texas.

01:49.576 --> 01:51.777
It's about an hour west of Waco.

01:51.779 --> 01:54.313
I got a call from a woman
named Christy.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.581
Now, she sounded pretty upset
on the phone,

01:56.583 --> 01:59.918
and she tells me the activity
in her house is out of control.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.653
Listening to her story
broke my heart,

02:01.655 --> 02:06.458
and I'm hoping there's something
Amy and I can do to help.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.994
Before Amy arrives, I look
for any leading information.

02:09.996 --> 02:14.332
Photographs, children's toys,
and even military medals

02:14.334 --> 02:16.335
can influence her findings.

02:16.337 --> 02:19.872
So it's important I cover
or remove them all.

02:19.874 --> 02:22.807
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

02:32.753 --> 02:36.688
This place has extreme
negative energy.

02:36.690 --> 02:41.226
There's this huge snake, like,
a human-sized king cobra.

02:45.432 --> 02:48.500
He's all about control.

02:48.502 --> 02:51.236
What I'm seeing is,

02:51.238 --> 02:55.840
this thing
has been here a long time.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.042
It's a battle to live here.

02:58.044 --> 03:02.447
Your soul is battling
against the darkness.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.458
So, Christy, I'm glad I'm here

03:13.460 --> 03:15.794
because when we talked
on the phone,

03:15.796 --> 03:17.596
you sounded really upset.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.064
It feels like hell here.

03:19.066 --> 03:21.466
You don't want to come home...

03:23.470 --> 03:26.405
...because the minute
you walk in that door,

03:26.407 --> 03:29.207
you're being emotionally
attacked, emotionally drained.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.542
We moved here in 2012.

03:31.544 --> 03:34.412
So, Christy, who lives
in the house now?

03:34.414 --> 03:37.950
Right now, just my husband
and I, Steve.

03:37.952 --> 03:40.419
- Okay.
- And these are my two girls.

03:40.421 --> 03:43.555
My daughter Tiffany, she lived
with us for a little while,

03:43.557 --> 03:45.757
and this is
my daughter Jessica,

03:45.759 --> 03:49.294
but I'm most concerned
about my grandkids.

03:49.296 --> 03:50.629
What's going on
with the grandkids?

03:50.631 --> 03:53.332
They say there's a mean man
in the back room.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.433
I made that area, so they could
play back there and have fun,

03:55.435 --> 03:57.369
but they're too scared
to play in there.

03:57.371 --> 04:00.972
I think whatever's here
hates kids.

04:00.974 --> 04:02.307
So that's got to kill you
as a grandmother.

04:02.309 --> 04:04.843
It does. It really,
really, really does.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.311
What do you think
is going on here?

04:06.313 --> 04:09.314
Whatever is here is evil,
and in my heart of hearts,

04:09.316 --> 04:11.049
I feel like it's a demon.

04:11.051 --> 04:14.786
Well, I hope it's not, but if
you're right, it's an issue.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.053
Yes, sir.

04:16.055 --> 04:17.856
So do me a favor
and give me an idea

04:17.858 --> 04:19.791
of what you guys
are experiencing.

04:19.793 --> 04:24.195
Being held down,
being pushed, scratches,

04:24.197 --> 04:27.666
mood swings, health issues.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.935
Now, you mentioned mood swings.
What are we talking about?

04:29.937 --> 04:32.137
Ever been so scared,

04:32.139 --> 04:35.874
it's like a fear
that you just want to cry?

04:35.876 --> 04:38.610
When you leave here,
do you feel better?

04:38.612 --> 04:40.612
I mean, do you go to work?

04:40.614 --> 04:44.082
I used to work at the female
maximum-security prison

04:44.084 --> 04:46.618
right down the street,
and I can't work anymore

04:46.620 --> 04:48.486
because of my health issues.

04:48.488 --> 04:49.688
Okay.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.489
So there's a female prison
down the block?

04:51.491 --> 04:53.759
- Yeah, right down the street.
- Okay.

04:53.761 --> 04:54.960
That might be something
I want to look into.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.095
So let me ask you a question.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.163
Why didn't you just
sell this place

04:58.165 --> 04:59.698
and get the hell out of here?

04:59.700 --> 05:02.634
What's to say that whatever
is here doesn't follow me?

05:02.636 --> 05:04.569
This is supposed to be
our forever home.

05:04.571 --> 05:06.304
It's not supposed to be
a house of nightmares.

05:11.445 --> 05:15.714
I am not welcome here.

05:15.716 --> 05:18.449
This place
sucks up energy, man.

05:18.451 --> 05:21.186
It's just like a cesspool.

05:21.188 --> 05:23.521
I'm getting pushed out.

05:23.523 --> 05:26.591
It's, like, right in my gut,

05:26.593 --> 05:30.195
and it's physically
pushing me back,

05:30.197 --> 05:34.199
which make me feel nervous.

05:34.201 --> 05:35.533
The snake, that thing,
it is manipulating people

05:35.535 --> 05:37.001
and what they're seeing.

05:37.003 --> 05:41.339
It makes you, like, have bizarre
thoughts, bizarre behaviors.

05:41.341 --> 05:45.543
You probably aren't thinking
quite rationally.

05:45.545 --> 05:47.546
Do you know what this thing is?

05:47.548 --> 05:50.549
I think, like, people think,
like, it's Satan.

05:53.887 --> 05:54.953
It's evil.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.088
It's a demon.

06:03.096 --> 06:05.497
Okay.
So what's going on in here?

06:05.499 --> 06:08.499
I felt someone sitting
on the edge of my bed,

06:08.501 --> 06:11.503
just like this, and then
it got right back up,

06:11.505 --> 06:14.639
and you could actually
see it release.

06:14.641 --> 06:17.242
Okay.
Would you say it was an adult?

06:17.244 --> 06:19.711
- It felt like a man.
- Okay.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.145
- Was Steve in bed with you?
- No.

06:21.147 --> 06:22.514
He had already left for work.

06:22.516 --> 06:23.714
All right. Anything else?

06:23.716 --> 06:27.719
I have woken up with scratches
on my arm.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.521
There were three scratches.

06:29.523 --> 06:30.922
Is it possible you
did it yourself?

06:30.924 --> 06:33.525
No. No.
My nails aren't that long.

06:33.527 --> 06:36.127
All right, so I can't think
of an explanation.

06:36.129 --> 06:37.662
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

06:37.664 --> 06:39.264
Something touched on my leg.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.365
How?

06:40.367 --> 06:44.001
Like this and on my calf, too.

06:44.003 --> 06:45.337
What'd it feel like,
a man's hand, a woman?

06:45.339 --> 06:47.338
Like a man's hand,
like a caress.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.541
It was inappropriate,
and it was cold.

06:53.347 --> 06:55.346
My god. He's got --

06:55.348 --> 06:56.948
Okay, just a sec
because he's coming up.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.617
He's coming up my legs and arm.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.952
I'm not gonna let him do that.

07:00.954 --> 07:03.021
Just a sec.

07:03.023 --> 07:08.226
Get off my **** legs, like,
like, right now, please.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.695
It seeps into your body.

07:10.697 --> 07:14.566
Ice, ice, ice-cold.

07:14.568 --> 07:19.571
I think that people
have been hurt here.

07:22.575 --> 07:23.842
Has anything else happened
in here?

07:23.844 --> 07:25.043
I was laying here one night.

07:25.045 --> 07:28.980
I could hear wings
and as it came toward me,

07:28.982 --> 07:30.448
it pushed me back on the bed.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.451
I felt like it was trying
to take over my body.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.653
I mean, I could actually feel
my eyes being rolled

07:35.655 --> 07:36.922
in the back of my head.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.723
What did you do
when that happened?

07:38.725 --> 07:40.792
I kept saying,
"I need to say, 'No.'

07:40.794 --> 07:43.929
I need to say, 'No,'"
and when I did, whoosh.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.930
It receded and went back
in the back of the house,

07:45.932 --> 07:49.601
but you could still hear
the wings flapping.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.069
I was so scared, I cried.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.138
- What did you think it was?
- I felt it was demonic.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.273
I feel like it was trying
to take over my body.

07:55.275 --> 07:57.475
I'm hoping that's not the case
because if it is,

07:57.477 --> 08:01.746
then it's a lot worse
than we thought.

08:01.748 --> 08:04.415
This snake thing,
it's, like, big.

08:04.417 --> 08:06.351
I can't put my arms around it,

08:06.353 --> 08:10.956
and he knows where you're weak.

08:10.958 --> 08:14.226
And then part of him,
part of him goes with you,

08:14.228 --> 08:15.726
like a seed, you know?

08:15.728 --> 08:18.763
It can infect you, and then you
go off and do really bad

08:18.765 --> 08:20.197
**** here.

08:20.199 --> 08:23.702
He's, like, fixated on making
people zombies.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.036
They can do his bidding.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.305
I feel like it's trying
to control me.

08:31.778 --> 08:35.647
He's jacking up my head,
and it hurts.

08:35.649 --> 08:38.850
He's torturing living people.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.529
So, Jessica, I just got
finished talking to Mom.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.064
Are you aware of how bad
things are?

08:53.066 --> 08:55.667
- Yes, very much aware.
- Okay.

08:55.669 --> 08:58.736
So I understand you're Christy's
daughter with the kids.

08:58.738 --> 09:00.539
Yes.

09:00.541 --> 09:02.474
I have four,
three boys and a girl.

09:02.476 --> 09:04.809
You can't be comfortable
bringing your kids here.

09:04.811 --> 09:05.944
I'm not.

09:05.946 --> 09:08.079
It's very hard.
It really is.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.748
Now, you've never lived here.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.749
No.
You couldn't make me live here.

09:11.751 --> 09:12.884
Okay.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.819
So have you had
your own experiences?

09:14.821 --> 09:16.154
- Yes, I have.
- Okay.

09:16.156 --> 09:17.622
So let's talk about
some of them.

09:17.624 --> 09:21.026
One time, I felt an icy caress
down my back.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.561
Okay, so where were you
when this happened?

09:22.563 --> 09:25.363
- I was in the back playroom.
- Okay.

09:25.365 --> 09:28.300
There was no one else
in the room besides me,

09:28.302 --> 09:31.569
and it sent, like,
a cold shot through my body.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.705
Like, I felt it
from head to toe.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.173
Okay. Anything else?

09:35.175 --> 09:38.510
In this room, I saw something
that I just can't explain.

09:38.512 --> 09:40.177
Okay.
Tell me what it looked like.

09:40.179 --> 09:41.513
The only way I can think
to describe them

09:41.515 --> 09:45.249
are gremlin-like creatures
crawling across the ceiling.

09:45.251 --> 09:49.120
There were four of them,
and they had four legs.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.388
And you're positive it wasn't

09:50.390 --> 09:52.123
some kind of reflection
from outside?

09:52.125 --> 09:54.592
My mom keeps the blinds
in here closed.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.194
I have to ask you.
I mean, after seeing that,

09:56.196 --> 09:58.596
why did you bring kids
back here after that?

09:58.598 --> 10:00.297
Because as hard as it
is to come here,

10:00.299 --> 10:02.400
I don't want to cost them
the opportunity

10:02.402 --> 10:05.737
to spend time with my parents,
and I love my mother very much.

10:05.739 --> 10:11.543
I think that whatever is here
is draining the life from her.

10:11.545 --> 10:14.545
I think
it's trying to kill her.

10:14.547 --> 10:17.682
Okay.

10:17.684 --> 10:20.618
How might the living here
be affected by this thing?

10:20.620 --> 10:24.956
I think they could
become violent.

10:24.958 --> 10:28.292
I think they could
become depressed.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.361
It would be bad.

10:30.363 --> 10:33.898
It doesn't end well here
for living people.

10:59.590 --> 11:03.259
So, Tiffany, things are
pretty bad in this house.

11:03.261 --> 11:04.727
Yes, very bad.

11:04.729 --> 11:07.396
I can see that you're upset,
but why did you think

11:07.398 --> 11:09.398
it was important
to talk in this room?

11:09.400 --> 11:11.868
I used to live here,
and I stayed in this room.

11:11.870 --> 11:13.736
Okay, so this place has
bad memories for you?

11:13.738 --> 11:15.471
Yes.

11:15.473 --> 11:17.874
Okay. You okay?

11:17.876 --> 11:20.076
I feel very emotional
and scared back here.

11:20.078 --> 11:21.410
Okay. All right.

11:21.412 --> 11:24.080
- Sorry.
- No, no. It's okay. Relax.

11:24.082 --> 11:26.082
It's all right.
No, no, no, no.

11:26.084 --> 11:28.617
It's okay.

11:28.619 --> 11:30.753
Nothing's gonna happen
to you while I'm here.

11:30.755 --> 11:32.355
Trust me on that.

11:32.357 --> 11:33.556
That makes me feel better.

11:33.558 --> 11:35.224
Yeah, good. All right?

11:35.226 --> 11:38.293
Take me through some
of the experiences you had.

11:38.295 --> 11:40.963
In certain areas,
there's cold spots.

11:40.965 --> 11:43.499
Okay, now, there's a vent
right above you there.

11:43.501 --> 11:45.634
Could that explain it?

11:45.636 --> 11:46.869
No.

11:46.871 --> 11:48.237
The heat would be on.

11:48.239 --> 11:49.505
And how cold are we talking?

11:49.507 --> 11:51.574
Like, freezer cold.

11:51.576 --> 11:54.644
Okay. Anything else?

11:54.646 --> 11:58.448
When I laid down to go to sleep,
and all of a sudden,

11:58.450 --> 12:02.118
I heard a male whisper
in my ear my name.

12:02.120 --> 12:04.921
- What was the voice like?
- It'd been in an aggressive way.

12:04.923 --> 12:07.857
It went like, "Tiffany!"

12:07.859 --> 12:09.392
Anything else?

12:09.394 --> 12:10.926
I had a dream...

12:10.928 --> 12:12.128
Okay.

12:12.130 --> 12:15.397
...of a little girl
standing over me.

12:15.399 --> 12:17.199
Describe the girl to me.

12:17.201 --> 12:19.001
She was, like, about 6 or 7.

12:19.003 --> 12:23.672
She had long blonde hair,
and her eyes were solid black.

12:23.674 --> 12:25.007
You worried about Mom as well?

12:25.009 --> 12:27.210
Very worried about her,

12:27.212 --> 12:30.480
and I couldn't stand it
if anything happened to her.

12:30.482 --> 12:33.549
Well, we're gonna make sure
nothing does, okay?

12:33.551 --> 12:35.818
- I hope so.
- All right.

12:42.293 --> 12:46.028
I'm seeing a little girl.

12:46.030 --> 12:50.566
She is a dead person,
and she's probably,

12:50.568 --> 12:52.901
I don't know, maybe even,
like, 8 or 9?

12:58.977 --> 13:02.044
I do get that the dead little
girl comes in here a lot.

13:05.049 --> 13:09.185
That she likes
to get on the bed.

13:09.187 --> 13:11.320
She crawls up on it.

13:20.130 --> 13:21.998
- Hey, Steve.
- How you doing?

13:22.000 --> 13:23.332
Good.
You got a moment to chat?

13:23.334 --> 13:25.601
- Yes, I do.
- All right, great.

13:25.603 --> 13:29.305
So, Steve, a lot of male clients
are pretty skeptical.

13:29.307 --> 13:30.540
How about you?

13:30.542 --> 13:31.941
I was at first.

13:31.943 --> 13:33.208
What changed your mind?

13:33.210 --> 13:34.877
I was sitting out on the porch
one night,

13:34.879 --> 13:37.680
and I heard a man
clearing his throat.

13:37.682 --> 13:39.348
I know this place
is pretty remote,

13:39.350 --> 13:40.482
and nobody really around here,

13:40.484 --> 13:42.552
but could it have been
some transient guy

13:42.554 --> 13:44.152
maybe just walking
through?

13:44.154 --> 13:46.689
Possible, that's why I grabbed
the flashlight,

13:46.691 --> 13:48.557
got in my truck,
drove around the property

13:48.559 --> 13:50.560
to look
but didn't see anything.

13:50.562 --> 13:51.827
All right. Anything else?

13:51.829 --> 13:53.829
We have a doll.

13:53.831 --> 13:56.566
The doll has a hat.

13:56.568 --> 13:59.302
The hat was found
in the hallway

13:59.304 --> 14:01.837
on two different occasions
on the same day.

14:01.839 --> 14:03.506
And you don't have any animals
that might grab

14:03.508 --> 14:04.907
the hat
off the doll and...

14:04.909 --> 14:06.108
- No animals.
- ...walk away with it?

14:06.110 --> 14:08.043
No animals.

14:08.045 --> 14:09.912
So I was talking to your wife,

14:09.914 --> 14:12.515
and I tell you, pretty upsetting
what she's going through.

14:12.517 --> 14:14.049
I mean, how are you dealing
with that?

14:14.051 --> 14:16.452
I feel totally helpless.

14:16.454 --> 14:18.120
She can be cheery one minute,

14:18.122 --> 14:21.056
and then she spends
some time being depressed.

14:21.058 --> 14:23.659
If Amy says to leave,
what are you gonna do?

14:23.661 --> 14:24.860
We're gonna get out.

14:24.862 --> 14:27.596
For the safety of my family,
we will do that.

14:27.598 --> 14:30.867
Okay.

14:30.869 --> 14:36.806
I feel very, very anxious, like
really stressed out back here.

14:36.808 --> 14:41.944
I'm seeing this crying man.

14:41.946 --> 14:43.946
You know, he's just, like,
freaking out.

14:47.752 --> 14:51.954
Really, like, super high energy
anxious dude.

14:51.956 --> 14:54.824
The crying man is back here.

14:54.826 --> 14:59.362
I think that the living

14:59.364 --> 15:02.097
would experience

15:02.099 --> 15:05.101
his extreme anxiety,

15:05.103 --> 15:07.036
his emotional state.

15:11.175 --> 15:13.642
I also think they
would hear him.

15:13.644 --> 15:16.178
He's very loud.

15:16.180 --> 15:18.113
He's very physical.

15:20.851 --> 15:22.852
So movement of objectives.

15:22.854 --> 15:24.854
It's not found in the same spot,

15:24.856 --> 15:28.724
which may cause them
to second-guess themselves.

15:28.726 --> 15:30.926
I think
it would make you crazy.

15:30.928 --> 15:34.463
I'm feeling death right now.

15:54.851 --> 15:56.250
This place is so small,

15:56.252 --> 15:59.186
it makes the middle
of nowhere seem exciting.

15:59.188 --> 16:00.588
So I made my usual calls

16:00.590 --> 16:02.656
and just heard back
from the county sheriff.

16:02.658 --> 16:06.460
Now, he knows all about Steve
and Christy's property

16:06.462 --> 16:09.396
and says the land used to be
owned by another sheriff,

16:09.398 --> 16:12.733
that is until he lost everything
during an arrest gone bad.

16:20.075 --> 16:21.808
Now, you mentioned on the phone
that one of the owners

16:21.810 --> 16:24.278
of my clients' land
was also a sheriff.

16:24.280 --> 16:26.747
Yes, sir. His name was
Walter Hollingsworth.

16:26.749 --> 16:29.816
He's very well-liked
within the town

16:29.818 --> 16:31.619
You know, they describe him
as a tall man

16:31.621 --> 16:32.820
with a lot of nervous energy.

16:32.822 --> 16:35.423
In 1908, he married his wife,

16:35.425 --> 16:36.890
Birdie, and the two
of them of them

16:36.892 --> 16:39.960
eventually had five kids.

16:39.962 --> 16:42.163
Okay, so now, before he comes
the sheriff,

16:42.165 --> 16:44.098
was he a deputy
or anything like that?
No, sir.

16:44.100 --> 16:47.101
Sheriff Hollingsworth was
a really religious guy.

16:47.103 --> 16:48.902
He was known as a preacher.

16:48.904 --> 16:52.906
Sheriff Hollingsworth decided
to run for sheriff in 1914.

16:52.908 --> 16:54.842
He believed that he could do
more good

16:54.844 --> 16:58.446
as a lawman than a preacher.

16:58.448 --> 16:59.647
So now, you mentioned
on the phone

16:59.649 --> 17:00.981
that things went pretty bad
for him

17:00.983 --> 17:02.383
when an arrest went wrong.

17:02.385 --> 17:03.584
What happened?

17:03.586 --> 17:05.653
I'm sure, Steve,
when you was driving in,

17:05.655 --> 17:07.854
you noticed close
to your clients' property

17:07.856 --> 17:10.523
that there was a woman's
prison out there.

17:10.526 --> 17:13.928
Used to be a boy's
reformatory school.

17:13.930 --> 17:14.994
Okay.

17:14.997 --> 17:18.332
In 1931, there was a subject
in the jail

17:18.334 --> 17:21.002
that was very mentally
unstable.

17:21.003 --> 17:23.671
Well, Sheriff Hollingsworth
went back to try to subdue him,

17:23.673 --> 17:25.071
and during the fight,

17:25.074 --> 17:29.810
the jail doctor came to try
to help Sheriff Hollingsworth,

17:29.812 --> 17:34.281
and he swung a metal pipe
trying to hit the offender

17:34.283 --> 17:35.349
and wound up striking

17:35.351 --> 17:37.284
Sheriff Hollingsworth
in the head.

17:37.286 --> 17:39.086
All right.

17:39.088 --> 17:41.756
So he gets hit with friendly
fire from a steel pipe?

17:41.758 --> 17:45.359
Absolutely, and the injuries
were brutal.

17:45.361 --> 17:47.294
- Does he die on the scene?
- No.

17:47.296 --> 17:51.132
He actually goes to
a sanitarium in Waco,

17:51.134 --> 17:53.234
but with all
the brain swelling,

17:53.236 --> 17:55.770
he had to have
a portion of it removed.

17:55.772 --> 17:57.171
All right.
So what happened?

17:57.173 --> 18:01.042
He continued on as sheriff,
and in 1933,

18:01.044 --> 18:03.377
he bought
your clients' property.

18:03.379 --> 18:04.845
Okay. All right.

18:04.847 --> 18:06.180
But within a year,

18:06.182 --> 18:12.119
he died due to the complication
from his injury.

18:12.121 --> 18:15.723
I'm seeing
this crying man again.

18:15.725 --> 18:19.593
He's really stressed out.

18:19.595 --> 18:24.532
I do think, like, he was,
like, really religious.

18:24.534 --> 18:26.133
I think he's got, like,
I'm thinking

18:26.135 --> 18:28.202
it's the Bible with him.

18:28.204 --> 18:30.470
God. I feel sick.!

18:30.472 --> 18:32.339
He's super anxious,
really, like,

18:32.341 --> 18:34.541
super high-energy anxious dude.

18:39.415 --> 18:43.016
He said the economy
was really bad.-

18:43.018 --> 18:44.751
So he was murdered.

18:44.753 --> 18:47.421
But I don't know where.

18:50.360 --> 18:51.759
All right, so now, he's dead,

18:51.761 --> 18:53.994
and he's got a wife
and, what, five kids?

18:53.996 --> 18:55.896
- Yes.
- So what happened with them?

18:55.898 --> 18:58.432
Birdie, his wife, actually was
appointed sheriff

18:58.434 --> 18:59.900
and completed his term.

18:59.902 --> 19:01.301
Female sheriff?

19:01.303 --> 19:05.105
The first and only female
sheriff here in Coryell County.

19:05.107 --> 19:07.775
- Okay.
- Unfortunately, money was tight.

19:07.777 --> 19:10.311
Right.
You know, being in the middle
of the Great Depression,

19:10.313 --> 19:12.713
she had to relinquish
that property.

19:12.715 --> 19:17.785
She wound up dying nearby
in 1953 at the age of 68,

19:17.787 --> 19:21.122
and that's a photo of her.

19:21.124 --> 19:22.523
She don't look too happy?

19:22.525 --> 19:24.458
No, she looks pretty hurt.

19:31.067 --> 19:33.868
So there is
a dead woman here.

19:33.870 --> 19:35.803
She lived here for a long time.

19:35.805 --> 19:37.337
I feel like she knows
this place.

19:37.339 --> 19:38.538
You know what I'm saying?

19:38.540 --> 19:41.876
And I probably say
she's probably, like,

19:41.878 --> 19:45.946
late 70s, early 80s?

19:45.948 --> 19:51.151
Like, I almost want to put her
in the '40s or '50s, maybe.

19:54.223 --> 19:59.893
She's saying the guy with
the Bible outside comes inside.

19:59.895 --> 20:04.098
She said, "He bothers them.
He bothers them a lot."

20:08.370 --> 20:12.773
And she's like, "He will stand
there all night and just

20:12.775 --> 20:16.510
****, like, preach."

20:16.512 --> 20:19.847
That freaks out
the living people here.

20:19.849 --> 20:22.183
They're hearing him talking,

20:22.185 --> 20:25.986
and they're feeling his energy.

20:25.988 --> 20:28.922
They're freaking out
because he overwhelms them.

20:28.924 --> 20:30.657
He overwhelms them.

20:41.136 --> 20:43.136
For more information
about the show,

20:43.138 --> 20:44.605
and if you need us
to investigate

20:44.607 --> 20:46.540
unexplained activity
in your home...

20:46.542 --> 20:50.010
Please visit
travelchannel.com/thedeadfiles.

20:50.012 --> 20:51.345
Click on "Help me, Dead Files!"

20:51.347 --> 20:57.952
to submit your story,
and we'll help if we can.

21:06.260 --> 21:08.594
So here's an interesting fact
about this city.

21:08.596 --> 21:10.929
About 15,000 people live here,

21:10.931 --> 21:13.132
and more than half of them
are locked up.

21:13.134 --> 21:15.134
Now, Christy was a guard
at that big prison

21:15.136 --> 21:17.937
down the street from her house,
so I called a local author

21:17.939 --> 21:20.672
who said it used to be
a boy's reformatory,

21:20.674 --> 21:22.808
and what went on there
was so shocking,

21:22.810 --> 21:24.210
it will definitely
help my case.

21:32.086 --> 21:33.552
Well, Dr. Bush, thanks
for meeting me here.

21:33.554 --> 21:34.687
I appreciate that.

21:34.689 --> 21:37.022
Before we get to what went wrong
at the school,

21:37.024 --> 21:38.357
how did it even start?

21:38.359 --> 21:41.694
It opened because of a group
of Christian women reformers

21:41.696 --> 21:44.296
who had been visiting
all of the prisons in Texas

21:44.298 --> 21:46.298
to check on
the conditions there,

21:46.300 --> 21:49.101
and they discovered
all of these teenage boys

21:49.103 --> 21:51.704
in the prisons
with the adult prisoners,

21:51.706 --> 21:55.241
so in 1889,
68 boys were transferred out of

21:55.243 --> 21:57.910
the Texas prisons
into Gatesville,

21:57.912 --> 21:59.245
and I have a picture
of it right here

21:59.247 --> 22:02.915
to give you a sense
of what it looked like.

22:02.917 --> 22:04.316
When did it go bad?

22:04.318 --> 22:06.451
It started going bad pretty much
right from the beginning --

22:06.453 --> 22:09.121
a lot of fighting,
a lot of violence,

22:09.123 --> 22:12.858
definitely reports
of inmate rape.

22:12.860 --> 22:14.459
What were their living
conditions like?

22:14.461 --> 22:16.662
They had these sort of
mass-custody dorms.

22:16.664 --> 22:18.397
I've got a picture
of one of them here.

22:18.399 --> 22:21.734
You can see it's just rows
and rows of beds.

22:21.736 --> 22:24.069
It's almost like
a hospital ward.

22:24.071 --> 22:26.071
So there's a lot of
overcrowding there.

22:26.073 --> 22:27.539
It was really unsanitary,

22:27.541 --> 22:30.075
so you had disease epidemics
break out.

22:30.077 --> 22:33.045
In 1918 when
the Spanish Flu epidemic

22:33.047 --> 22:36.348
swept the United States,
300 boys in Gatesville

22:36.350 --> 22:39.284
caught it,
and eight of them died.

22:39.286 --> 22:42.554
Another eight died
in accidents,

22:42.556 --> 22:44.757
other sicknesses
that could've been prevented

22:44.759 --> 22:46.491
if conditions had been better.

22:46.493 --> 22:48.493
What happens to their bodies?
Their family take them?

22:48.495 --> 22:50.495
There was actually a cemetery

22:50.497 --> 22:53.766
that still exists
on the grounds today.

22:53.768 --> 22:55.367
So I know it eventually
closed down,

22:55.369 --> 22:58.036
and now, it's a women's prison,
from what I understand.

22:58.038 --> 23:01.307
In '79, it shut down,
and the very next year in 1980,

23:01.309 --> 23:03.308
it reopened
as a women's prison.

23:07.648 --> 23:13.185
There's, like, all of these
very old brown skeletons.

23:13.187 --> 23:18.857
They just are to the side of,
like, this path,

23:18.859 --> 23:23.529
and I see a hundred men
facing the road,

23:23.531 --> 23:26.866
and all of them turn
at the same time.

23:26.868 --> 23:28.066
They're all men.

23:28.068 --> 23:29.734
They're all male,
and they're pointing,

23:29.736 --> 23:32.738
and what they're pointing at
is where the church should be,

23:32.740 --> 23:35.874
and all of a sudden,
all these walls come up,

23:35.876 --> 23:38.444
like these cement walls,

23:38.446 --> 23:40.812
and then I feel like it
was a trick,

23:40.814 --> 23:46.017
and I got duped,
and I'm trapped.

23:46.019 --> 23:50.089
The snake, that thing, that man,
it's causing violence.

23:50.091 --> 23:54.359
Any negative things
that living have done here

23:54.361 --> 23:55.628
was because of him.

23:59.901 --> 24:02.701
Since the reformatory
closed in 1979,

24:02.703 --> 24:04.369
there have got to be
some people in town

24:04.371 --> 24:05.770
who used to be inmates there.

24:05.772 --> 24:08.106
So I worked the phones, talked
to a bunch of the locals,

24:08.108 --> 24:10.375
and I finally got in touch
with one guy

24:10.377 --> 24:12.778
who says the experience
was so horrible,

24:12.780 --> 24:13.846
he's never gotten over it.

24:20.254 --> 24:21.854
Obviously, this school
was a big deal

24:21.856 --> 24:24.256
to have a whole wing
to it in this museum.

24:24.258 --> 24:26.792
I don't mean to pry, but I need
to know if you can tell me.

24:26.794 --> 24:28.326
How the hell did you wind
up in here?

24:28.328 --> 24:30.062
Truancy, believe it or not.

24:30.064 --> 24:31.530
All right.
So let me get this straight.

24:31.532 --> 24:33.599
You wound up in prison
because you didn't go to school?

24:33.601 --> 24:34.934
You skipped out of school?

24:34.936 --> 24:36.802
I mean would've been in jail
at 11.

24:36.804 --> 24:39.204
What year did you get
sentenced here?
1975.

24:39.206 --> 24:40.739
I was 15.

24:40.741 --> 24:43.075
I just spoke to a professor
who told me

24:43.077 --> 24:44.676
that the conditions
were barbaric there.

24:44.678 --> 24:45.944
What was it like
when you were there?

24:45.946 --> 24:48.213
You could've called it
a gladiator farm.

24:48.215 --> 24:50.816
In order to have any kind
of respect

24:50.818 --> 24:54.486
with any of the kids there, you
had to stand up for yourself.

24:54.488 --> 24:55.888
Otherwise, you would be
eaten alive.

24:55.890 --> 24:58.156
And it's not something
you get out of your head.

24:58.158 --> 25:00.226
No. I still think about that.

25:00.228 --> 25:02.428
Did you ever attempt
to get out of this place?

25:02.430 --> 25:04.563
More times than
I can probably count.

25:04.565 --> 25:06.965
Okay, when you escaped,
what was it like?

25:06.967 --> 25:11.436
Somewhere between terrifying
and exhilarating.

25:11.438 --> 25:13.839
Your heart is racing
100 miles an hour.

25:13.841 --> 25:16.508
The horsemen, we heard them
as they were approaching

25:16.510 --> 25:18.777
because you could hear them
talking on their walkie-talkies.

25:18.779 --> 25:22.515
You could hear the dogs baying,
absolutely terrifying.

25:22.517 --> 25:24.183
It's the run for your life,

25:24.185 --> 25:26.852
and you knew that
if they caught you

25:26.854 --> 25:30.523
that you were going to take
a pretty hardcore beating

25:30.525 --> 25:32.257
or get killed.

25:32.259 --> 25:34.326
So, obviously,
you got picked up.
Yes.

25:34.328 --> 25:37.730
Unfortunately, the Coryell
County Sheriff's Department,

25:37.732 --> 25:41.000
the state guys, they were
all on top of us like crazy.

25:41.002 --> 25:43.335
So do you know of anyone
personally

25:43.337 --> 25:45.938
that didn't make it back
from one of these escapes?

25:45.940 --> 25:49.808
There was a kid on our dorm
that didn't make it back.

25:49.810 --> 25:52.144
I believe it happened
to a lot of kids.

25:52.146 --> 25:55.147
I believe some of them
are still on the grounds.

25:55.149 --> 25:56.282
I really do.

25:56.284 --> 25:58.484
Do you think you ever got
over your time here?

25:58.486 --> 26:00.085
No, probably not.

26:00.087 --> 26:02.554
It took me a long time
to get to where

26:02.556 --> 26:05.290
I didn't sleep
with one eye open.

26:05.292 --> 26:09.828
I think it's haunted a lot of
people, and it still haunts me.

26:20.374 --> 26:23.642
I saw a lot of disturbing things
during my walk,

26:23.644 --> 26:26.512
but the snakelike creature
tormenting the living

26:26.514 --> 26:28.847
has me the most concerned.

26:28.849 --> 26:33.918
It was
this gray nonhuman thing.

26:33.920 --> 26:38.757
He had, like, pin-straight hair,
like, an abnormally thin neck,

26:38.759 --> 26:43.862
leaning over a person in a bed,
and he turned into a snake.

26:46.467 --> 26:49.267
I would make that
a little bit wider...

26:49.269 --> 26:50.468
- Wider?
- Yeah.

26:50.470 --> 26:52.605
...and not too much
nostril here.
Okay.

26:58.946 --> 27:02.014
Amy, is this what you saw?

27:02.016 --> 27:03.415
Yes.

27:28.974 --> 27:31.842
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:31.844 --> 27:34.711
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

27:34.713 --> 27:37.581
and our clients
for the first time.

27:37.583 --> 27:40.250
So, Amy, this is Christy,
and this is her husband, Steve.

27:40.252 --> 27:42.785
They live here together,
and this is Tiffany,

27:42.787 --> 27:44.254
Christy's daughter.

27:44.256 --> 27:46.856
Now, I got to tell you.
Christy's story broke my heart.

27:46.858 --> 27:48.525
She believes whatever here
is evil

27:48.527 --> 27:51.461
and hates women and children,
and that's a huge problem

27:51.463 --> 27:54.530
because Christy has four
beautiful grandchildren.

27:56.801 --> 27:59.669
Now, these kids visit a lot,

27:59.671 --> 28:01.871
so she's hoping you can show her
what's here

28:01.873 --> 28:04.207
and how to kick it out.

28:04.209 --> 28:06.476
So now that Amy knows a little
bit about you guys,

28:06.478 --> 28:08.211
she'll tell us about her walk.

28:14.886 --> 28:17.754
There's an extreme amount
of negative energy

28:17.756 --> 28:20.090
here in this area.

28:20.092 --> 28:23.560
I was feeling multiple deaths
that had occurred,

28:23.562 --> 28:26.029
very violent deaths
that were nearby.

28:26.031 --> 28:31.568
I was shown a lot of really
old bones,

28:31.570 --> 28:34.036
and they were all scattered.

28:34.038 --> 28:35.572
The next thing was,

28:35.574 --> 28:40.444
I saw about a hundred people.

28:40.446 --> 28:43.713
They were pointing towards
what should be a church,

28:43.715 --> 28:46.182
but it was in ruins.

28:46.184 --> 28:48.518
Then these large cement walls

28:48.520 --> 28:53.590
just came up on all four sides
and just blocked me in.

28:53.592 --> 28:55.392
A lot of what you mentioned
makes me think of the prison

28:55.394 --> 28:56.793
right down the road from here.

28:56.795 --> 28:59.062
Now, Christy, actually,
you worked there, right?

29:00.532 --> 29:03.200
So these days, it's a maximum
security women's prison.

29:03.202 --> 29:04.668
Really?

29:04.670 --> 29:07.203
But back in the day, it was
a boy's reformatory school.

29:07.205 --> 29:08.404
Interesting.

29:08.406 --> 29:11.040
Now, you mentioned
that you saw a church.

29:11.042 --> 29:15.678
It was started in the late 1800s
by a woman's Christian group.

29:15.680 --> 29:17.013
The goal of this whole thing
was to help

29:17.015 --> 29:19.148
troubled kids
turn their lives around.

29:19.150 --> 29:22.285
Instead, it turned
into a nightmare.

29:22.287 --> 29:26.088
They were abused, beaten,
raped, tortured.

29:26.090 --> 29:28.759
How could anyone do that
to children?

29:28.761 --> 29:32.162
Conditions were so bad there,
16 kids died in a 20-year period

29:32.164 --> 29:35.298
from 1900 to 1920.

29:35.300 --> 29:37.634
The kids were buried
right on the grounds

29:37.636 --> 29:41.638
just down the street from here.

29:41.640 --> 29:45.709
Cemetery's still there today.

29:45.711 --> 29:47.510
Now, the abuse
went on for years.

29:47.512 --> 29:51.514
Finally, the Feds came in,
and in 1979, they shut it down.

29:51.516 --> 29:54.851
I heard stories,
and I didn't know what was true

29:54.853 --> 29:56.253
and what wasn't true.

30:00.225 --> 30:03.126
Okay. So what else?

30:03.128 --> 30:07.130
One of the dead people
that I ran into

30:07.132 --> 30:11.868
was a deceased little girl.

30:11.870 --> 30:15.939
I was guessing her age
at about 8 years.

30:15.941 --> 30:19.142
Living people in this house
might see her.

30:19.144 --> 30:20.610
That's interesting.

30:20.612 --> 30:23.146
Tiffany, did you tell me about
having a dream of a little girl?

30:23.148 --> 30:24.948
I did.

30:24.950 --> 30:26.616
She had long blonde hair.

30:26.618 --> 30:29.152
I didn't see what she was
wearing or anything,

30:29.154 --> 30:31.554
but she did
have solid black eyes.

30:31.556 --> 30:32.688
Interesting.

30:32.690 --> 30:36.158
She spends a lot of time
in the master bedroom.

30:36.160 --> 30:41.431
She also was showing me
that she would get into bed

30:41.433 --> 30:43.833
and crawl kind of
to the bottom of the bed

30:43.835 --> 30:47.437
and curl up like
a little dog.

30:47.439 --> 30:49.172
I was laying in bed,

30:49.174 --> 30:53.777
and I felt like something
was definitely in the bed.

30:59.117 --> 31:03.320
The next dead person I ran into
was just freaking out,

31:03.322 --> 31:05.989
so I call him the crying man.

31:05.991 --> 31:09.125
He has a very big impact

31:09.127 --> 31:12.128
on the living in this house.

31:12.130 --> 31:16.600
He has extremely high anxiety.

31:16.602 --> 31:20.804
He can easily affect the living
and their emotions

31:20.806 --> 31:22.672
when they're around him,

31:22.674 --> 31:27.077
so that could swing
from extreme stress and anxiety

31:27.079 --> 31:29.078
to extreme depression,

31:29.080 --> 31:33.950
possibly even the need
to cry unexpectedly.

31:33.952 --> 31:39.356
I go from crying to large
bouts of depression,

31:39.358 --> 31:43.359
sadness, anxiety,
and there's lots of anger,

31:43.361 --> 31:46.228
constant roller coaster
of emotions.

31:46.230 --> 31:48.899
So, Tiffany, when you're here,
do you feel that?
Yes.

31:48.901 --> 31:53.770
I feel sad and especially
in the back room.

31:53.772 --> 31:57.240
Now, you used to live back
in that room?
Yes, I did.

31:57.242 --> 31:59.308
He talks a lot,

31:59.310 --> 32:02.912
so I thought that maybe
the living here would hear him.

32:02.914 --> 32:04.380
Tell Amy what happened.

32:04.382 --> 32:06.650
I was sitting out on the porch
one night,

32:06.652 --> 32:09.652
and it sounded like a man
cleared his voice,

32:09.654 --> 32:11.221
got my attention.

32:11.223 --> 32:14.857
I got a flashlight, and I drove
around the property, nothing.

32:14.859 --> 32:16.660
I was in that back room,

32:16.662 --> 32:18.061
and I was getting ready
to go to bed.

32:18.063 --> 32:21.197
I had just laid down,
and out of nowhere,

32:21.199 --> 32:23.332
I heard my name
whispered in my ear,

32:23.334 --> 32:24.935
and it was a man's voice.

32:24.937 --> 32:27.403
Okay. Okay.

32:27.405 --> 32:30.607
So any idea who this guy
might've been when he was alive?

32:30.609 --> 32:32.541
So he was white.

32:32.543 --> 32:36.746
I believe he owned
this property at some point.

32:36.748 --> 32:40.016
He was extremely religious,
and he just said, you know,

32:40.018 --> 32:41.818
"The economy was horrible.

32:41.820 --> 32:45.422
Everything was really bad.
We lost it all."

32:45.424 --> 32:48.825
I think I might know
who she's talking about.

32:48.827 --> 32:50.626
Back in the 1930s,
this property was owned

32:50.628 --> 32:52.696
by a former sheriff
of the county.

32:52.698 --> 32:54.497
His name was
Walter Hollingsworth.

32:54.499 --> 32:57.834
He was extremely,
extremely religious.

32:57.836 --> 33:00.637
Before he was a sheriff,
he was a preacher.

33:00.639 --> 33:02.238
Wow. Okay.

33:02.240 --> 33:04.374
I also tracked down a photo
of Hollingsworth

33:04.376 --> 33:09.179
when he first got the job
as the sheriff.

33:09.181 --> 33:12.782
Now, in 1931, his life changed.

33:12.784 --> 33:14.317
An inmate was going nuts
in the jail,

33:14.319 --> 33:17.854
and Hollingsworth tackled him
to get him to calm down.

33:17.856 --> 33:21.257
The jail doctor
grabs a lead pipe.

33:21.259 --> 33:23.192
He tried hitting the convict
with that lead pipe,

33:23.194 --> 33:25.728
but he wound up
hitting the sheriff.

33:25.730 --> 33:27.063
He was in the hospital
a long time

33:27.065 --> 33:29.399
and even had part
of his brain removed.

33:29.401 --> 33:30.600
****.

33:30.602 --> 33:33.402
- No.
- My god.

33:33.404 --> 33:35.405
Now, he died three years
later in 1934

33:35.407 --> 33:40.143
due to complications from
that injury at the age of 60.
Okay.

33:40.145 --> 33:44.414
After that accident, his wife,
Birdie, took over as sheriff.

33:44.416 --> 33:45.815
I actually have
a picture of her.

33:50.355 --> 33:53.356
But by 1935,
she was completely broke

33:53.358 --> 33:55.825
and had to give up
the property.

33:55.827 --> 33:59.161
She ended up dying in 1953
at the age of 68.

33:59.163 --> 34:00.897
She was penniless.

34:06.637 --> 34:10.706
So this kind of brings me
to what I think

34:10.708 --> 34:13.643
is the biggest problem here.

34:13.645 --> 34:16.513
It was showing itself as, like,

34:16.514 --> 34:21.851
a huge snake like a king cobra.

34:21.853 --> 34:26.989
It seemed to me like this thing
had really never been human

34:26.992 --> 34:30.059
and was ancient,

34:30.061 --> 34:32.462
and it has a very big effect

34:32.464 --> 34:36.065
on living people.

34:36.067 --> 34:41.938
It can cause accidents,
and it can get physical.

34:41.940 --> 34:43.472
My god.

34:43.474 --> 34:46.141
He's coming up my legs, and I
am not gonna let him do that.

34:46.143 --> 34:50.346
Get off my **** legs,
like, like, right now.

34:50.348 --> 34:52.415
It seeps into your body.

34:52.417 --> 34:55.552
Ice-cold.

34:55.554 --> 34:56.819
I was laying there one night

34:56.821 --> 35:01.958
and a cold hand
touched my thigh,

35:01.960 --> 35:05.028
and it worked its way
down to my calf.

35:05.030 --> 35:06.095
Yeah, it was cold.

35:09.367 --> 35:13.235
I didn't know that was
happening to her.

35:13.237 --> 35:15.538
I did have a sketch done.

35:22.313 --> 35:24.514
Wow.

35:30.322 --> 35:32.655
Wow.

35:36.460 --> 35:39.729
I'm pissed off.

35:39.731 --> 35:43.733
I'm very upset

35:43.735 --> 35:45.935
that it's doing
that to my mother.

35:49.674 --> 35:53.542
I was sitting on the bed and had
that other door shut,

35:53.544 --> 35:57.747
and then I heard wings
flapping toward my bedroom,

35:57.749 --> 36:01.484
and it flew into the door
and pushed me on the bed,

36:01.486 --> 36:05.888
and the force held me
on the he bed so hard,

36:05.890 --> 36:07.423
it was hard to breathe,

36:07.425 --> 36:10.093
and I could actually feel
my eyes rolling back in my head,

36:10.095 --> 36:12.361
and I couldn't talk.

36:12.363 --> 36:13.896
Now, does any of that
what she's saying

36:13.898 --> 36:16.098
make any sense to you?

36:16.100 --> 36:18.968
Yeah.

36:18.970 --> 36:20.903
You know, it's kind of hard
to see what this thing

36:20.905 --> 36:22.905
really looks
like from this sketch.

36:22.907 --> 36:24.373
Did you get a better look
at this thing?

36:24.375 --> 36:26.375
I had its face sketched.

36:26.377 --> 36:27.844
The face, okay.

36:39.858 --> 36:42.125
My god.

36:48.799 --> 36:50.667
Wow.

36:50.669 --> 36:52.402
It looks pure evil.

37:00.278 --> 37:03.145
This thing can make people have,

37:03.147 --> 37:07.817
you know,
extremely bizarre thoughts,

37:07.819 --> 37:10.753
hallucinations, acting out,

37:10.755 --> 37:13.756
bizarre behaviors,
all of that.

37:13.758 --> 37:15.692
The stuff that happened
at the boy's reformatory,

37:15.694 --> 37:17.694
the sheriff getting hit
and stuff like that,

37:17.696 --> 37:20.296
could that have been
caused by this thing?
Yes.

37:20.298 --> 37:22.432
Any violence that goes on in
and around here

37:22.434 --> 37:27.036
is caused directly by this,
by this thing.

37:27.038 --> 37:28.972
What the hell does this thing
want from these guys?

37:28.974 --> 37:33.976
Its ultimate goal is
to make people zombies,

37:33.978 --> 37:37.646
and it does this by planting
seeds in the living.

37:37.648 --> 37:40.316
It'll influence them
to do things

37:40.318 --> 37:44.987
that they wouldn't normally do.

37:44.989 --> 37:47.656
My god.

37:47.658 --> 37:49.391
I'm scared to leave her
at home by herself now

37:49.393 --> 37:51.861
that I know what's going on.

37:51.863 --> 37:53.863
What the hell is this thing?

37:53.865 --> 37:57.266
Well, like a demon-devil.

37:57.268 --> 38:01.671
You know,
this is true **** evil.

38:01.673 --> 38:02.805
I knew it wasn't good,

38:02.807 --> 38:06.609
but I would've
never expected this bad.

38:06.611 --> 38:11.214
This is even worse than
I what I had in my mind.

38:11.216 --> 38:13.082
I'm sorry. I need a minute.

38:53.923 --> 38:56.724
So, Christy, I've done
over 150 of these cases,

38:56.726 --> 39:00.128
and I can't tell you
how many people think they know

39:00.130 --> 39:03.197
what's going on
in their own home.

39:03.199 --> 39:07.601
Unfortunately, in this case,
you were right on the money,

39:07.603 --> 39:10.071
so now we're gonna
answer the big question.

39:10.073 --> 39:13.007
Can you stay and fight it
like you want to,

39:13.009 --> 39:15.009
or do you need to pack up
and get out?

39:15.011 --> 39:16.543
For that answer, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

39:20.951 --> 39:25.886
So this thing has done damage

39:25.888 --> 39:28.956
for a very long time,

39:28.958 --> 39:31.359
and Christy,
his plan for you

39:31.361 --> 39:36.364
is to just get rid of you,
kill you off.

39:36.366 --> 39:39.434
Steve, he says
he can control you.

39:39.436 --> 39:41.969
He's behind you, beside you.

39:41.971 --> 39:45.172
He wants all of you
and that he's almost there.

39:49.779 --> 39:53.114
For you, Tiffany,

39:53.116 --> 39:55.450
he said he enjoys you

39:55.452 --> 39:59.654
and that you're next,
that he'll come for you,

39:59.656 --> 40:03.390
and there is a small seed
already inside of your body.

40:03.392 --> 40:05.726
- My god.
- No, no.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.667
So how do we stop it,
or can we stop it?

40:16.005 --> 40:19.007
Okay.
So here's the thing, Tiffany.

40:19.009 --> 40:23.478
The seed and the attachment
need to be removed

40:23.480 --> 40:26.614
by a Native American shaman

40:26.616 --> 40:30.151
and that once this is done,
you can never return here.

40:35.224 --> 40:39.427
Steve,
you need a purification

40:39.429 --> 40:42.029
and blessing ceremony.

40:44.367 --> 40:45.967
You can never return after.

40:50.440 --> 40:55.109
And then, Christy,

40:55.111 --> 40:59.047
you definitely need to move
as soon as possible.

40:59.049 --> 41:02.316
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

41:02.318 --> 41:06.454
You okay, Tiff?

41:06.456 --> 41:10.591
I'm scared. I'm upset.

41:10.593 --> 41:13.661
I'm...I don't know
what to feel right now.

41:24.073 --> 41:25.540
So if they do all of this,

41:25.542 --> 41:29.077
will they eventually get back
to being a normal family?

41:29.079 --> 41:32.880
Yes.

41:32.882 --> 41:35.750
I get my mom back,
and if she has to move...

41:35.752 --> 41:40.154
- We'll start over elsewhere.
- Okay.

41:40.156 --> 41:41.689
You promise me you're gonna
listen to what she said?

41:41.691 --> 41:42.756
- Exactly.
-100%.

41:42.758 --> 41:43.891
- That's a promise.
- I understand.

41:43.893 --> 41:45.493
It's gonna happen.
It's gonna happen.

41:45.495 --> 41:46.960
Okay.

41:46.962 --> 41:51.899
My mom means everything to me,
so I appreciate y'all.

41:51.901 --> 41:55.703
It's never easy telling a family
to leave their home,

41:55.705 --> 42:00.241
but in a situation as dangerous
as this, it's their only option.

42:00.243 --> 42:04.912
Hopefully, they take my advice,
leave this demon behind

42:04.914 --> 42:08.382
and get a fresh
start someplace new.

42:12.388 --> 42:15.123
Hi, our house is under contract
to sell.

42:15.125 --> 42:17.257
We have followed Amy's advice,

42:17.259 --> 42:20.194
and we're looking forward
to moving into a new home

42:20.196 --> 42:22.864
and having our grandkids
come stay with us again,

42:22.866 --> 42:25.533
so we're just hoping
for a new beginning

42:25.535 --> 42:43.150
and to be able to start over.
