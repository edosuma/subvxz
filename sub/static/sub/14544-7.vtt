03:28.320 --> 03:33.280
HOMESICK

04:12.761 --> 04:16.402
I think Bruce is depressed.
He's acting really strange.

04:16.498 --> 04:17.875
So now you need your mother?

04:17.966 --> 04:21.209
No, Mom, I need a therapist.

04:21.303 --> 04:24.944
Anyway, I'm home now.
Got to go.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.850
- "Howdy Doody."
- Hi.

07:50.946 --> 07:53.187
All set for our negotiations tomorrow?

07:53.281 --> 07:57.127
Well, not "negotiations negotiations,"
but "negotiations."

07:57.219 --> 07:59.665
What do you mean
by "negotiations negotiations"?

07:59.754 --> 08:00.596
You know what I mean.

08:00.689 --> 08:04.967
These negotiations
are just a formality.

08:05.060 --> 08:07.802
Everyone in this department
gets the same salary, so...

08:07.896 --> 08:10.308
So, why bother with negotiations?

08:10.398 --> 08:11.877
It's company policy.

08:11.967 --> 08:16.143
I mean, it's not "policy policy,"
but "policy."

08:16.238 --> 08:22.052
Plus, it's the only time the company
pays for our lunch.

08:22.143 --> 08:23.679
Okay.

08:23.778 --> 08:26.258
So, is it lunch or "lunch lunch"?

08:26.348 --> 08:29.522
It's "lunch lunch."

14:18.700 --> 14:21.874
Everyone in this department
earns 80,000 kronor per month.

14:26.507 --> 14:28.180
Should we just I say 200,000 then?

14:28.276 --> 14:30.278
No, that's...

14:30.378 --> 14:33.951
Everyone earns the same amount,
so it's 80,000, like I just said.

14:38.052 --> 14:40.532
Should we say 100,000?
Then we'll both walk away happy.

14:40.622 --> 14:42.602
80,000.
You know that's what it'll be.

14:46.394 --> 14:50.740
81,000. That's my lowest offer.
Or else I'm leaving this room.

14:51.799 --> 14:52.800
80,000.

14:52.900 --> 14:54.811
Okay, I'm out!

14:57.805 --> 15:00.046
- I'm gonna do it. For real.
- Fine.

15:00.141 --> 15:02.314
Okay, now I mean it.
This is me going.

15:02.410 --> 15:06.381
- I'm going home now!
- Don't forget our 2:45 meeting!

15:06.481 --> 15:08.961
I won't.
I'll be back by then.

18:23.845 --> 18:26.086
Hi. How can I help you?

21:33.434 --> 21:38.406
Hey! Go easy on the ketchup.
This outfits pretty special.
