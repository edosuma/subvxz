00:41.440 --> 00:43.670
Ten o'clock changeover. Anything to report?

00:43.840 --> 00:47.594
We're still lagging behind Red Dwarf, sir,
almost 24 hours behind.

00:47.800 --> 00:50.234
Otherwise, it's been a moderately quiet shift,

00:50.400 --> 00:55.997
except for one small shock when we noticed
an alien fleet off the starboard bow.

00:56.200 --> 01:01.513
Thankfully, it turned out to be one
of Mr Lister's sneezes on the radar screen.

01:01.680 --> 01:04.477
- How are we fuel-wise?
- Unchanged for today, sir.

01:04.640 --> 01:07.950
However, the supply situation
grows increasingly bleak.

01:08.120 --> 01:12.193
We've recycled the water so often,
it tastes like Dutch lager.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.997
- We're OK for food, aren't we?
- Confidentially, sir, no.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.913
We've no meat, no pulse and little grain.

01:20.080 --> 01:25.473
Worse still, the only Liquorice Allsorts left
are the twisty ones that everybody hates.

01:25.640 --> 01:28.996
What's more,
space weevils ate the last of the corn.

01:29.200 --> 01:31.191
So what's under the grill?

01:31.400 --> 01:33.391
Space weevil.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.595
You can't serve space weevil, Kryten.

01:39.760 --> 01:45.596
Not even Lister with his single remaining
taste bud will eat insectoid vermin.

01:45.760 --> 01:48.194
Let's face it, it's practically cannibalism.

01:48.400 --> 01:52.552
But it's incredibly nutritious, sir.
After all, it is corn-fed.

01:53.360 --> 01:57.672
- He'll never eat it.
- Trust me. The first bite is with the eye.

01:57.840 --> 02:00.274
It's all down to presentation.

02:02.480 --> 02:03.913
Et voilà!

02:04.880 --> 02:07.440
- Changeover. Anything new?
- Nothing much.

02:07.600 --> 02:11.912
Electrical storm, alien war fleet -
false alarm - the usual stuff.

02:12.080 --> 02:17.438
Look at the state of this place!
Why can't you clean up before we swap over?

02:17.640 --> 02:21.679
What the hell is this
down the back of my chair? Peanuts?

02:21.880 --> 02:24.314
No, I've been trimming my verrucas.

02:26.880 --> 02:30.668
You have personal habits
that would make a monkey blush!

02:30.880 --> 02:35.351
You really think I'm psychotically
disgusting, don't you? They're peanuts, OK?

02:35.520 --> 02:37.829
Real peanuts? Where'd you get them?

02:38.040 --> 02:43.034
That derelict a couple of months back.
I found them in the dead captain's jacket.

02:43.200 --> 02:46.112
Don't look like that. You enjoyed that mint.

02:46.280 --> 02:50.432
- Where d'you get that?
- He was sucking that when he got shot.

02:50.600 --> 02:52.830
I had to prise his jaws open.

02:53.920 --> 02:57.879
You think I'll buy
anything you say, don't you?

02:58.040 --> 03:00.634
Well, wrong, buddy! Now get outta here.

03:00.800 --> 03:07.638
I gotta keep my eyes skinned for the asteroid
shaped like a moose you told me about.

03:07.840 --> 03:11.833
- Hi, honey, I'm home.
- Supper, sir, and tonight's movie.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.549
I'm sorry, sir, it is another Doug McClure.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.592
- What's this?
- Sir?

03:22.640 --> 03:24.471
Raw carrot?

03:26.040 --> 03:29.953
Kryten, you know
how I feel about fresh vegetables.

03:30.120 --> 03:34.636
They're for health psychos, vitamin freaks,
people... who exercise.

03:35.520 --> 03:37.511
I'm sorry, sir.

03:41.840 --> 03:44.434
- Is everything OK, sir?
- No, it's not.

03:44.600 --> 03:48.832
Some smegger's filled in
this "Have you got a good memory?" quiz.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.116
That was you, sir, last week.

03:53.920 --> 03:55.911
- Was it?
- Mmm. Look.

03:56.080 --> 03:58.878
Nobody else spells "Thursday" with an "F".

03:59.760 --> 04:02.718
I can't help it. I went to art college.

04:02.880 --> 04:07.670
- How's supper, Listy?
- Delicious. We had king prawn left?

04:08.960 --> 04:12.953
I hate to go all technical, but swirly thing alert!

04:16.399 --> 04:19.709
- Where?
- It's not on the radar, but I smell it.

04:19.920 --> 04:22.150
- Nothing here.
- Nothing on long range.

04:22.320 --> 04:26.552
Is it possible
you could have made a mis-smelling?

04:26.720 --> 04:29.757
Listen, butter pat head,

04:29.960 --> 04:35.193
my nostril hairs are vibrating faster than
the springs on a Spaniard's honeymoon bed!

04:35.360 --> 04:41.515
- I'm telling you, something's out there!
- No one's questioning your nasal integrity.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.879
- Go to Blue Alert.
- There's no one to alert. We're all here.

04:48.320 --> 04:53.155
I would feel more comfortable if we're all
on our toes in a Blue Alert situation.

04:53.360 --> 04:58.514
- We all ARE on our toes.
- What about Space Core Directive 34124?

04:58.720 --> 05:05.159
34124- "No officer with false teeth
should attempt oral sex in zero gravity."

05:07.480 --> 05:10.950
Damn you both! I want to go to Blue Alert!

05:11.160 --> 05:13.116
OK, OK.

05:16.040 --> 05:18.429
Thank you. A bit of professionalism.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.750
Wait! I've got something.

05:24.320 --> 05:26.515
Too small for a vessel. A missile?

05:26.720 --> 05:31.396
Whatever it is, they clearly have
technology way in advance of our own.

05:31.600 --> 05:35.229
So do the Albanian State
Washing Machine Company.

05:35.400 --> 05:38.392
- Step up to Red Alert!
- Are you sure?

05:38.560 --> 05:41.711
It does mean changing the bulb.

05:44.040 --> 05:46.315
There's always some excuse, isn't there?

05:46.520 --> 05:49.432
Range 15,000 gigooks and closing.

05:49.640 --> 05:52.598
- Collisión course. Suggest evasive action.
- Engaging re-heat.

05:56.440 --> 05:59.238
It's still with us!
It's some kind of heat-seeker!

05:59.440 --> 06:02.796
That's it. We're deader than tank tops.

06:03.520 --> 06:04.919
Suggestions?

06:05.080 --> 06:08.516
Sir, I recommend I load myself
into the reverse-thrust tubes

06:08.680 --> 06:11.240
and you use me as decoy fodder.

06:11.400 --> 06:15.916
This will leave me splattered across space
and unable to complete today's laundry,

06:16.080 --> 06:18.753
for which I apologise in advance.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.639
Stop blathering and get in the tube.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.831
Kryten, sit down.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.594
I'm not doing me own smeggin' ironing.

06:27.360 --> 06:31.797
Maybe we can reason with it.
Open communication channels, Lister.

06:31.960 --> 06:38.195
Broadcast on all known frequencies,
and in all known languages, including Welsh.

06:40.320 --> 06:43.517
This is acting senior officer Arnold J Rimmer

06:43.680 --> 06:47.798
of the Jupiter Mining Corporation
transport vehicle Starbug.

06:47.960 --> 06:51.236
Now hear this, 'cause it's only coming once.

06:51.400 --> 06:54.949
We surrender, totally and without condition.
Thank you for listening.

06:55.120 --> 06:59.398
Oh, additional. Sorry to take up
your valuable time. Thank you. Bye.

06:59.560 --> 07:01.869
Bye. Sorry. Thank you. Bye.

07:02.080 --> 07:07.200
Rimmer, you've got a longer yellow streak
than a stampede of diuretic camels.

07:08.280 --> 07:12.910
Know this about me - like General
George S Patton, I believe in reincarnation.

07:13.080 --> 07:17.995
It is my conviction that
in all my previous lives I've been a soldier,

07:18.160 --> 07:24.838
a bold warrior soul, who in this incarnation
has been given the body of an abject coward.

07:26.320 --> 07:32.111
So excuse me while I have a humiliating
panic attack under the scanner table.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.958
- Here it comes!
- Five gigooks to impact.

07:36.120 --> 07:38.156
Hang on to your wage packets!

07:44.360 --> 07:46.351
The controls are down!

07:46.520 --> 07:50.354
- What on Io was that?
- A suction beam. We're being dragged down.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.551
- Fire up the retros.
- Dead.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.278
- Auxiliary power?
- Dead.

07:54.440 --> 07:56.112
- Joystick?
- Dead.

07:56.280 --> 08:00.558
The entire panel's deader
than flares with pockets in the knees!

08:02.320 --> 08:04.959
I've located the beam's source.

08:18.600 --> 08:21.068
- What have we got?
- We were snared

08:21.240 --> 08:26.678
by a malfunctioning guidance beam
designed to help docking supply ships.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.673
- We've shut it down and can leave.
- Anyone around?

08:29.840 --> 08:33.196
- No life signs.
- The ident computer is stubborn.

08:33.360 --> 08:36.909
All I could get was something
about classified military research.

08:37.080 --> 08:40.549
Wouldn't give details,
but the physicists involved -

08:40.720 --> 08:45.794
Heideger, Davro, Holder, Quayle -
the most brilliant minds of the 23rd century.

08:45.960 --> 08:49.350
Whatever they were cooking up
must have been pretty special.

08:49.520 --> 08:51.829
- Anything to salvage?
- There must be something.

08:52.520 --> 08:57.389
Well, gentlemen, our strategy is clear.
Let's tool up and go shopping.

09:03.160 --> 09:07.358
- What? Anything?
- I'm not sure. Something.

09:07.520 --> 09:10.318
It's almost off my nasal spectrum.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.879
Strange. A life reading.

09:20.040 --> 09:22.031
Why didn't it register before?

09:23.680 --> 09:29.312
Welcome, friends. It has been
many centuries since I last had visitors.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.710
You, of course, are Kryten.

09:31.920 --> 09:36.118
And you are Rimmer, the hologram. May I?

09:38.920 --> 09:42.879
Now then... Yes, of course.

09:45.440 --> 09:47.635
Primitive.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.075
So basic.

10:01.400 --> 10:05.279
You'd better have a mighty
damn fine explanation, m'laddio.

10:05.480 --> 10:10.554
Forgive me. I converted your projection unit
from soft light to hard light.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.159
Hard light?

10:14.280 --> 10:19.832
I've got a body? I can touch? Feel?

10:20.040 --> 10:23.032
Puncture repair kit on standby, sir.

10:23.240 --> 10:27.313
- But how?
- I created the hard light drive years ago.

10:27.480 --> 10:30.756
My mind is not all that it once was.

10:31.800 --> 10:35.634
- You are Lister.
- How come you know who we are?

10:35.840 --> 10:39.833
- You are in pain. Here.
- Just a bit of Bangalore belly.

10:40.040 --> 10:43.715
No. It is something more serious. May I?

10:43.880 --> 10:45.359
OK.

10:56.520 --> 10:58.954
Your appendix.

10:59.120 --> 11:02.829
As I thought,
you were on the verge of peritonitis.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.591
Cheers, man.

11:06.280 --> 11:09.590
- And you are the Cat.
- You come near me,

11:09.760 --> 11:12.911
you'll be wearing them bowels
as a bobble hat.

11:13.120 --> 11:17.955
You're all tired and in need
of nourishment. Come, let us dine.

11:18.160 --> 11:21.914
- What is your name?
- Call me... Legion.

11:22.880 --> 11:26.031
Please, make yourselves comfortable.

11:26.240 --> 11:29.038
Legion, these statues,
you sculpted them yourself?

11:29.240 --> 11:31.674
Years ago. I was a different person.

11:31.880 --> 11:37.238
According to my connoisseur chip, they fulfil
all ten requirements for being masterpieces.

11:37.400 --> 11:41.188
- You have a connoisseur chip?
- Looking like Herman Munster's stunt man

11:41.360 --> 11:43.430
doesn't mean I can't appreciate art.

11:43.640 --> 11:48.873
- I shall return with the feast.
- Can I eat? I mean, in this body?

11:49.040 --> 11:52.794
Mr Rimmer,
you can do anything a human can do,

11:52.960 --> 11:55.190
plus you are practically indestructible.

11:55.360 --> 11:58.670
- I can't be hurt?!
- Your pain responses remain the same,

11:58.840 --> 12:00.831
but you cannot come to harm.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.797
Excuse me.

12:04.280 --> 12:09.229
His cellular structure is unique -
part living tissue, part mechanical.

12:09.440 --> 12:13.638
He's got to come with us.
He'd get us to Earth in weeks!

12:13.800 --> 12:18.669
What a team we'd make. Legion, with his
scientific genius, intellect and culture,

12:18.840 --> 12:21.718
and us with... with...

12:21.920 --> 12:24.673
With our Red Alert bulb.

12:24.840 --> 12:29.755
Let's head for Real Street here.
This Johnny won't come with us.

12:29.920 --> 12:36.109
He'd never fit in. Can you see him playing
"pin the pointy stick on the weather girl"?

12:36.320 --> 12:40.916
True, but once he's signed up
and we're off, it'll be too late.

12:41.080 --> 12:45.153
We have to pretend
we're not the uncouth morons you are.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.232
Here is the feast. It is a traditional
24th-century Mamosian banquet.

12:53.440 --> 12:57.149
How absolutely divine, Legion.
Although I must say,

12:57.320 --> 13:02.394
our souls are already gorged
with the feast of art on your walls.

13:02.600 --> 13:05.194
Are you interested in art, Mr Rimmer?

13:05.400 --> 13:11.509
Many's the night we while away the wee hours
contemplating a Caravaggio's themes and form.

13:11.720 --> 13:14.280
The pointy-stick game doesn't get a look-in.

13:14.480 --> 13:19.713
Marvellous! Now, this three-dimensional
sculpture in particular is quite exquisite.

13:19.880 --> 13:22.189
Its simplicity, its bold, stark lines.

13:22.360 --> 13:25.432
- What do you call it?
- The light switch.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.674
- The light switch.
- Yes.

13:28.840 --> 13:31.229
- I couldn't buy it, then?
- Not really.

13:31.440 --> 13:34.079
I need it to turn the lights on and off.

13:34.280 --> 13:39.752
It's a pity, because in many ways
it could be considered a masterpiece.

13:40.600 --> 13:44.957
Kryten, please join us. Mamosian cuisine
is quite acceptable for mechanoids.

13:45.120 --> 13:50.069
Indeed. It has long been a dream of mine
to sample its unique flavours.

13:50.240 --> 13:52.708
Let the meal begin.

13:54.960 --> 14:00.512
I'm sorry. Of course. Not all of you
can use Mamosian anti-matter chopsticks.

14:00.720 --> 14:03.439
I'm fully versed, Legion.

14:03.600 --> 14:07.354
I'm programmed to be proficient
in all off-worid eating techniques,

14:07.520 --> 14:13.117
including Jovian boogle hoops, and the
often-lethal Mercurian boomerang spoon.

14:13.320 --> 14:17.074
- But the others...
- Anti-matter chopsticks?

14:18.400 --> 14:22.757
- We use 'em all the time.
- Can't remember what a fork looks like.

14:22.960 --> 14:25.554
Don't let custard stains down Lister's long johns

14:25.720 --> 14:28.188
delude you
into thinking we're not sophisticated.

14:38.480 --> 14:42.359
The trick is, of course,
to never, ever, under any circumstances,

14:42.520 --> 14:45.398
to allow live sticks to touch.

14:45.560 --> 14:48.279
But, of course, we all know that.

15:00.240 --> 15:04.631
- Well, bon appetite. Tuck in, Listy.
- No, no. After you, man.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.791
Wouldn't hear of it.

15:24.880 --> 15:29.032
Sir, keep the electron flow
in the same direction.

15:29.760 --> 15:32.194
How do you land the damn stuff?

15:32.360 --> 15:36.194
Simply invert the ionic phase
in the downpulse.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.994
I was with you up to "simply".

15:39.200 --> 15:41.191
Like so.

15:49.320 --> 15:53.518
Sir, the glass is fixed.
It's Mamosian telekinetic wine.

15:53.680 --> 15:57.753
- How do you drink it?
- Simply will it into your mouth,

15:57.920 --> 16:00.753
then you telepathically
decide on its flavour. Thusly...

16:04.360 --> 16:05.998
Ah! Delicious.

16:10.280 --> 16:13.192
Kryten, help me!

16:18.280 --> 16:21.636
- Cat, that's mine!
- I can't help it, bud!

16:21.800 --> 16:25.270
- We've crossed wavelengths!
- You're pulling my teeth out!

16:25.440 --> 16:28.352
- Try swallowing it!
- I have! Three times!

16:31.960 --> 16:35.839
My friends, you are trying
to impress me. There's no need.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.275
Legion, may I be frank?

16:38.440 --> 16:45.118
It's not often we meet an individual who
could improve our already top-notch team.

16:45.280 --> 16:51.913
But in you, we feel we have. In our travels,
we've met precisely 31 individuals,

16:52.080 --> 16:56.358
and we've never felt moved
to invite one to join our crew.

16:56.520 --> 17:00.638
True, most of them wanted
to suck out our brains

17:00.800 --> 17:03.837
or erase us from history altogether.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.675
Nevertheless, they still weren't
what we would consider the right stuff.

17:08.839 --> 17:12.469
You are different. We feel that you, like us,

17:12.640 --> 17:17.270
have the courage and the dignity
to make it as a Dwarfer.

17:18.160 --> 17:20.151
Sir! Don't cross the chopsticks!

17:28.319 --> 17:32.313
Mr Rimmer, I am moved
by the eloquence of your invitation,

17:32.480 --> 17:36.678
but it is quite impossible for me
to leave the institute.

17:36.840 --> 17:41.789
- It was Lister, wasn't it? He put you off.
- Nothing can change your mind?

17:42.000 --> 17:45.310
- Absolutely.
- Then we must bid you farewell.

17:45.480 --> 17:48.313
- We have a long journey ahead.
- Nonsense.

17:48.480 --> 17:50.596
You have no journey, my friends.

17:50.760 --> 17:54.912
I insist you stay with me
as my honoured guests,

17:55.080 --> 17:57.799
from now until the day you die.

17:59.560 --> 18:00.959
Thirty-two.

18:03.640 --> 18:06.393
- This will be your cell, Dave.
- My cell.

18:06.560 --> 18:09.472
You really are a nutter, aren't you?

18:11.960 --> 18:15.032
Sugar Puff sandwiches, me favourite?

18:15.200 --> 18:17.634
Nothing here isn't to your liking.

18:17.800 --> 18:21.873
The entire room is stocked
for your own unique personal requirements.

18:22.040 --> 18:26.079
Two dozen eight-packs
and a spare pair of sneakers in the icebox.

18:26.240 --> 18:30.756
- Faultless. Not an inch wasted.
- All your favourite music and movies.

18:30.920 --> 18:33.275
Absolutely no Doug McClure.

18:34.320 --> 18:38.871
- You will want for nothing.
- Nothing? What about company? People?

18:39.080 --> 18:43.631
There is a cyberpark here.
You may go to any time period

18:43.800 --> 18:47.839
and indulge any fantasy you wish
with any persons you desire.

18:48.040 --> 18:51.953
And that's in some way
supposed to make me happy?

18:52.120 --> 18:55.351
S- Sorry, run that by me one more time?

18:55.520 --> 18:59.479
You will meet your companions in the morning.

18:59.640 --> 19:05.237
Now, you must excuse me.
They are falling asleep. I must go.

19:11.160 --> 19:13.355
Amazing. Doesn't even need tuning.

19:18.960 --> 19:21.155
- Good morning, sir.
- What does he want?

19:21.320 --> 19:24.357
Why is he obsessed with fulfilling our desires?

19:24.520 --> 19:28.911
We're all baffled, sir.
Was your room also perfect in every detail?

19:29.120 --> 19:34.035
Impeccable. Right down to the overstarched
pyjamas and nocturnal boxing gloves.

19:34.200 --> 19:38.432
- What about you?
- Filthy walls, muddy floors, mop...

19:38.600 --> 19:40.591
I was in hog's heaven, sir!

19:41.760 --> 19:45.753
When I write my "Good Psycho Guide",
this place'll get raves.

19:45.920 --> 19:48.434
Accommodation, excellent. Food, first-class.

19:48.600 --> 19:51.114
Resident nutter, courteous and considerate.

19:51.280 --> 19:54.875
Psycho rating's gotta be
four and a half chainsaws.

19:55.080 --> 19:57.878
Sirs, we must not be seduced.

19:58.040 --> 20:01.112
However munificent our captor,
we are still prisoners.

20:01.280 --> 20:04.716
Every second,
we lose more ground on Red Dwarf.

20:04.880 --> 20:07.474
You're right, Kryt. Cat, caviar niblet.

20:08.640 --> 20:12.076
Buck's Fizz.
How do we get out of this hellhole?

20:13.080 --> 20:16.470
Why is he so keen on keeping us happy?

20:16.640 --> 20:21.668
- Could our well-being be linked to his own?
- Like he's feeding off our emotions?

20:21.880 --> 20:25.156
When we arrived,
the scans recorded no life signs.

20:25.360 --> 20:29.433
Could our very presence here
have inadvertently awoken him?

20:29.640 --> 20:33.713
Wait. I think I've got a way
of getting out of here.

20:33.880 --> 20:37.589
Who's seen "Revenge of the Surfboarding
Killer Bikini Vampire Giris"?

20:38.200 --> 20:40.350
That one slipped us by, sir.

20:40.560 --> 20:46.237
Well, in one scene, the female journalist
who wore glasses and a tight sweater

20:46.400 --> 20:51.155
was trapped in the surfboarding
killer bikini vampire giris' lair

20:51.320 --> 20:54.278
and came up with this truly
award-winning escape plan.

20:57.560 --> 21:00.597
Ah, Legion. We have considered our position

21:00.800 --> 21:04.349
and decided to make a new life here with you.

21:05.280 --> 21:08.590
You believed I'd be deceived
by that schlock plan

21:08.760 --> 21:12.719
from "Revenge of the Surfboarding
Killer Bikini Vampire Giris"?!

21:18.200 --> 21:21.237
I just want you to be happy.

21:24.280 --> 21:28.193
Now look what you made me do.

21:31.880 --> 21:34.678
- What the hell are you, buddy?
- Kryten knows.

21:34.880 --> 21:36.950
- I do?
- You suspect the truth.

21:37.160 --> 21:43.508
You are a gestalt entity, a combination
of individuals melded together to form one?

21:43.720 --> 21:46.280
My name is Legion, for we are many.

21:47.520 --> 21:50.876
What? You're us? All four of us?

21:51.080 --> 21:54.709
Our combined minds
and personalities, blended together?

21:54.920 --> 21:57.593
Oh, much more than that,
exponentially more.

21:57.760 --> 22:01.230
The whole becomes far greater
than the sum of its parts.

22:01.440 --> 22:06.833
So we can't leave because you're us?
If we leave, you cease to be.

22:07.040 --> 22:10.999
Without you, my friends,
I am quite literally nothing.

22:11.200 --> 22:14.795
So if he's us, he can't hurt us, right?

22:19.040 --> 22:23.909
- Wrong.
- But this is insane. Our pain is your pain.

22:24.120 --> 22:28.432
Kryten, you forget. Not only
do I possess your combined intellects,

22:28.600 --> 22:34.357
I also share the sum of your malice
and rage and anger, magnified many times.

22:34.520 --> 22:39.150
I'm capable of quite insanely
irrational behaviour. Watch.

22:42.920 --> 22:47.357
The next hint of insurrection,
and the scalpel ends up... here.

22:47.560 --> 22:50.438
That kind of tough talk doesn't scare us.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.875
Yes, it does!

22:53.040 --> 22:56.316
But what about
the sculptures and the technology?

22:56.480 --> 22:59.438
- Where does that come from?
- My first incarnation.

22:59.680 --> 23:02.797
I was host to Earth's five most brilliant minds.

23:02.960 --> 23:07.511
They were studying collective intelligence.
I was the product of that research.

23:07.720 --> 23:13.272
Heideger, Quayle and the others?
Your mind must have been extraordinary!

23:13.480 --> 23:19.555
But all too soon, old age began to kill them,
and as each one died, I became less,

23:19.720 --> 23:22.518
until I was nothing, just a mindless essence,

23:22.680 --> 23:28.437
swirling around the remnants
of my achievements, waiting to exist again.

23:28.640 --> 23:31.359
- One thing still baffles me.
- What's that?

23:31.560 --> 23:35.758
- Everything.
- Sir, permissión to test a supposition...

23:35.960 --> 23:38.110
- Granted.
- Trust me, sir.

23:42.880 --> 23:46.509
- What's going down here?
- The gestalt requires our consciousness.

23:46.680 --> 23:51.754
As each of us becomes unconscious, his power
diminishes. Permissión to lay you out?

23:51.920 --> 23:55.037
- Just don't mess up my hair.
- Thank you.

23:57.400 --> 24:00.710
Kryten, there has to be
a more effective plan.

24:00.880 --> 24:04.111
- Sir, come back.
- I'm allergic to being hit.

24:04.280 --> 24:09.957
You won't feel a thing. I'll render you
unconscious using the Ionian nerve grip.

24:10.120 --> 24:13.430
That's smashing me over the head with a vase!

24:13.600 --> 24:18.720
There's no such thing
as an Ionian nerve grip. Now stand still!

24:19.440 --> 24:22.512
Your hard light drive's tougher
than vindalooed mutton!

24:23.560 --> 24:27.439
- This'll do the trick.
- You can't be serious?!

24:29.080 --> 24:32.629
Harder! Harder! Harder!

24:32.800 --> 24:38.318
Stop! Stop! For God's sake! If you want a job
doing properly, do it yourself!

24:41.120 --> 24:42.872
Stop!

24:43.040 --> 24:48.797
Stop, Kryten! Clearly, I'm a hard light
hologram and as such un-knockoutable.

24:48.960 --> 24:51.190
- I think you're right, sir.
- Kryten!

24:51.360 --> 24:55.069
- I thought that if I took you unawares...
- Kryten!

24:55.240 --> 24:58.949
I'm trying to think,
you rubber-headed eunuch!

24:59.120 --> 25:04.069
- Right, got it. Turn off my light bee.
- I can't penetrate hard light.

25:04.240 --> 25:07.596
You'll have to extract it yourself.

25:10.040 --> 25:13.077
- Now we are even.
- I am merely you. Stalemate.

25:13.280 --> 25:18.673
Not so. Since your psyche is all mine,
you are now incapable of malice.

25:18.840 --> 25:21.798
And because a human life takes precedence,

25:21.960 --> 25:25.589
you are compelled
to assist our safe passage to Starbug.

25:25.800 --> 25:28.951
While the others remain unconscious,
your logic is impeccable.

25:35.760 --> 25:39.992
- You take Cat, I'll take Mr Lister.
- In many ways, I'm relieved.

25:40.200 --> 25:43.317
To have shared their psyches,
neuroses and strange drives,

25:43.480 --> 25:46.790
returning to a state of non-existence
seems like promotion.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.198
One last thing, in your original incarnation,
composed of those great minds,

25:51.360 --> 25:54.830
did you develop anything
which might help us pursue Red Dwarf?

26:01.240 --> 26:04.391
Here we go. Initiating ignition sequence.

26:04.560 --> 26:07.711
- Is this gonna work?
- I don't see why not.

26:07.880 --> 26:11.270
It is indeed a fully functional stardrive.

26:11.440 --> 26:17.356
If we've linked it correctly to the engines,
we'll catch up with Red Dwarf in nanoseconds!

26:17.560 --> 26:20.074
- But it's bound to go wrong.
- Sir?

26:20.240 --> 26:22.959
- It always does, every time.
- He's right!

26:23.120 --> 26:26.317
There isn't a dog
in hell's chance this will work.

26:26.520 --> 26:30.069
Sirs, haven't we learned
that if we all pull together,

26:30.240 --> 26:33.391
we are greater than the sum of our parts,

26:33.560 --> 26:37.473
that there are no boundaries
to what we can achieve?

26:37.640 --> 26:41.872
This stardrive is going work. Do we believe?

26:42.080 --> 26:45.789
- We believe.
- Do we believe?

26:45.960 --> 26:48.394
We believe!

27:15.440 --> 27:18.318
- Well, we know one thing, sir!
- What's that?

27:18.480 --> 27:20.516
It does work!

27:23.080 --> 27:26.277
<i># It's cold outside,</i>
<i>there's no kind of atmosphere</i>

27:26.440 --> 27:29.671
<i># I'm all alone, more or less</i>

27:29.840 --> 27:33.037
<i># Let me fly far away from here</i>

27:33.200 --> 27:35.839
<i># Fun, fun, fun</i>

27:36.000 --> 27:39.549
<i># In the sun, sun, sun</i>

27:39.720 --> 27:43.110
<i># I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose</i>

27:43.280 --> 27:46.397
<i># Drinking fresh mango juice</i>

27:46.560 --> 27:49.791
<i># Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes</i>

27:49.960 --> 27:52.599
<i># Fun, fun, fun</i>

27:52.760 --> 27:56.514
<i># In the sun, sun, sun</i>

27:56.680 --> 27:59.274
<i># Fun, fun, fun</i>

27:59.440 --> 28:03.513
<i># In the sun, sun, sun #</i>
