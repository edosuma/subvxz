01:34.226 --> 01:37.461
Tell me, Cardinal, what
is the Italian for cannon?

01:38.778 --> 01:41.346
We have no such word, General.

01:41.710 --> 01:44.979
For gunpowder?

01:45.080 --> 01:47.147
Recoil? Battery?

01:47.215 --> 01:49.316
Cannonball? Ordnance?

01:49.384 --> 01:51.452
I'm at a loss.

01:51.553 --> 01:54.623
You will need a
new language then.

01:54.724 --> 01:57.058
Your Italy will
soon be deafened

01:57.159 --> 01:59.061
by the sound
of cannon.

02:21.521 --> 02:23.456
Be silent.

02:23.523 --> 02:25.425
Are we observed?

02:25.492 --> 02:27.260
No.

02:27.328 --> 02:29.429
But that goatherd waits inside

02:29.497 --> 02:32.732
for my loud...
and public apology.

02:38.039 --> 02:40.741
Did you abuse the goatherd?

02:40.842 --> 02:44.479
- Terribly.
- As you abuse me?

02:46.114 --> 02:48.549
The abuse was of a
different kind, my dear.

03:02.228 --> 03:05.631
Joffre?
Joffre, are you in the garden?

03:05.698 --> 03:07.766
Yes, Mother.

03:07.834 --> 03:10.769
Would you
join me, please?

03:10.870 --> 03:12.771
One moment.

03:12.872 --> 03:15.507
My husband
plays with feathers.

03:17.744 --> 03:19.679
Is he to your liking?

03:19.747 --> 03:22.949
He is sweetness itself.

03:24.418 --> 03:26.787
But he lacks your vigour.

03:30.624 --> 03:32.558
You must call on me then.

03:32.626 --> 03:35.027
When you have need of me.

03:40.166 --> 03:42.867
I must return to my
husband in the morning.

03:44.403 --> 03:47.505
- Why?
- Because he is my husband.

03:49.774 --> 03:52.343
Because our father
needs his allegiance.

03:52.410 --> 03:55.980
I should keep you here in chains.
I suspect you would be happier.

03:56.081 --> 03:58.315
Why do you question
my happiness?

03:58.416 --> 04:02.319
Because something
happened, I know it.

04:02.386 --> 04:05.521
- What do you know?
- Your eyes.

04:05.589 --> 04:08.225
You no longer
walk on air.

04:08.293 --> 04:10.227
Where is my young
sister hiding?

04:10.328 --> 04:13.230
I am the Lord Sforza's
wife, Brother.

04:13.331 --> 04:15.600
If he does ill by you
I shall do ill by him.

04:15.667 --> 04:18.236
He would be wise
to be kind, then.

04:20.339 --> 04:22.407
What are his pleasures?

04:24.177 --> 04:26.078
Hunting.

04:26.179 --> 04:28.414
The marital bed.

04:31.952 --> 04:33.619
I dislike him already.

04:33.720 --> 04:36.621
But he had
an accident, Brother.

04:36.722 --> 04:40.258
And now he can
indulge in neither.

04:40.325 --> 04:42.226
A happy accident?

04:42.294 --> 04:45.629
Yes. God is good.

04:45.730 --> 04:48.132
But he will recover?

04:49.568 --> 04:51.635
Unfortunately, yes.

04:58.277 --> 05:00.813
You are no longer
a child, Sis.

05:02.248 --> 05:04.350
I won't forgive
him for that.

05:04.451 --> 05:07.453
There was a reason for
my marriage, Brother.

05:10.224 --> 05:12.525
Remind me of it.

05:47.696 --> 05:51.564
We are blessed by the
Cardinal's presence here.

05:51.632 --> 05:54.567
Sadly, Abbess, the
business of a cardinal

05:54.668 --> 05:57.369
is overwhelmed by the
management of men.

05:57.471 --> 05:59.371
Our spiritual duties

05:59.472 --> 06:01.740
are all too
easily forgotten.

06:01.841 --> 06:04.442
But your contribution to
the abbey and its restoration

06:04.509 --> 06:06.543
is much appreciated.

06:08.012 --> 06:11.114
And our new novice,
Sister Martha,

06:11.182 --> 06:14.384
has a most divine
contralto voice.

06:32.003 --> 06:34.638
Sister Martha?

06:34.705 --> 06:38.309
Do I detect some levity
in your tone, Cardinal?

06:38.376 --> 06:40.311
Perhaps.

06:40.378 --> 06:42.679
It is inappropriate,
surely.

06:42.747 --> 06:45.950
You are the cardinal benefactor
of the Sisters of St. Cecilia.

06:46.017 --> 06:49.119
Although even I can see
the humour in that.

06:49.187 --> 06:52.757
You knew? When you
chose this convent?

06:54.193 --> 06:57.495
I discovered, after
I had taken my vows.

07:00.465 --> 07:03.034
Shall I resign
my responsibilities?

07:03.101 --> 07:05.970
Assign the benefice
to another cardinal?

07:09.408 --> 07:11.309
No.

07:11.410 --> 07:14.145
I shall never be free of you,
Cardinal. I knew that.

07:17.783 --> 07:20.685
You cannot touch me, Cardinal.
No man can touch me now.

07:20.786 --> 07:24.055
The one who touches me,
who lives inside my heart,

07:24.123 --> 07:27.525
who visits me nightly, died on
the cross many centuries ago.

07:27.626 --> 07:30.295
Ah!

07:30.363 --> 07:32.931
I have another rival then.

07:34.367 --> 07:37.235
And I can't kill Him.
You blaspheme now!

07:37.303 --> 07:40.572
Would you put yourself beyond
the grace of God entirely, Cardinal?

07:40.640 --> 07:42.708
No.

07:44.077 --> 07:46.511
I would manage my own destiny.

07:47.981 --> 07:50.049
You asked me
for liberation.

07:50.117 --> 07:52.352
And you gave it to me.

07:53.787 --> 07:56.222
You delivered me to here.

07:58.492 --> 08:00.427
I spend my days in penance,

08:00.495 --> 08:04.332
and... oddly
enough, in peace.

08:06.268 --> 08:08.403
You have a power,

08:08.470 --> 08:11.606
Cardinal Cesare Borgia,

08:11.674 --> 08:14.075
a strength, a destiny

08:14.176 --> 08:16.278
that even you
don't recognise.

08:16.345 --> 08:19.714
You read my heart, with
what may indeed have been

08:19.816 --> 08:22.350
the Devil's insight, and
you delivered me to God.

08:23.786 --> 08:26.788
You can use that strength
for good or for ill

08:26.856 --> 08:28.848
but I have no doubt
it will be used,

08:28.873 --> 08:30.901
and the whole of Italy
will be changed by it.

08:32.429 --> 08:35.999
Are you clairvoyant,
Sister Martha?

08:36.100 --> 08:39.903
No, but I think
I have been given

08:39.971 --> 08:42.907
some insight into
what guides your heart.

08:45.677 --> 08:47.612
I will never love
another man.

08:47.680 --> 08:50.648
And you should
leave now, Cardinal.

08:52.318 --> 08:54.919
It is forbidden.

09:03.062 --> 09:06.664
Sister Martha?

09:12.371 --> 09:13.938
Sister.

09:31.957 --> 09:35.193
You asked to meet me
alone, Father.

09:35.260 --> 09:37.295
Yes, my son.

09:43.569 --> 09:45.504
We have had intelligence

09:45.605 --> 09:48.907
that 25,000 and more
French troops

09:48.975 --> 09:52.011
are marching towards Milan.

09:57.452 --> 09:58.852
My God.

09:58.953 --> 10:02.223
Indeed. An apocalypse.

10:07.163 --> 10:10.699
It is a long march from France
to Rome. Anything could happen.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.034
Well, Milan will
grant safe passage.

10:13.135 --> 10:16.570
Il Moro has made his
intentions abundantly clear.

10:16.638 --> 10:18.572
And what about Florence?

10:18.640 --> 10:22.408
Well, you tell me.
You visited Florence.

10:23.810 --> 10:26.311
Florence keeps its counsel.

10:26.413 --> 10:29.615
And its counsel is called
Niccolo Machiavelli.

10:31.118 --> 10:33.953
I have his understanding
that Florence will do nothing

10:34.054 --> 10:35.888
if its territories
are not invaded.

10:35.989 --> 10:38.156
And if they are?

10:39.592 --> 10:42.327
It will do something.

10:42.428 --> 10:45.798
Its something may not
be enough for us.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.703
French arms may alter
the whole equation!

10:52.606 --> 10:55.041
Has the College
of Cardinals heard?

10:55.109 --> 10:57.978
No, but they will.

10:58.079 --> 11:01.048
And we can imagine
the discord already,

11:01.116 --> 11:04.686
everyone dividing
into factions.

11:06.956 --> 11:09.690
We are facing a battle

11:09.791 --> 11:11.892
for our very survival.

11:16.531 --> 11:19.800
I'm scared of thunder, Paolo.

11:19.867 --> 11:22.969
It often comes
before summer showers.

11:23.070 --> 11:26.072
No! Where is your imagination?

11:28.376 --> 11:30.810
It is God rehearsing his wrath.

11:30.878 --> 11:34.447
It is Jove flexing his muscles.

11:34.549 --> 11:37.819
It is my husband
throwing off his splint.

11:42.058 --> 11:44.426
He will walk again soon.

11:45.828 --> 11:48.096
What will we do
with our love then?

11:48.197 --> 11:50.464
- We can love in secret.
- Hm.

11:50.532 --> 11:53.100
We already love in secret.

11:56.571 --> 11:59.272
And you knew this couldn't
last forever, didn't you?

11:59.373 --> 12:01.441
Why not?

12:02.877 --> 12:05.345
Again, where is
your imagination?

12:05.413 --> 12:07.981
Have you not read
your Boccaccio,

12:08.049 --> 12:10.083
your Petrarch?

12:11.586 --> 12:13.787
You know I can't read.

12:16.391 --> 12:18.659
If you did, you'd know.

12:20.061 --> 12:22.295
Young lovers are
always doomed.

12:50.555 --> 12:53.557
Oh, my lady!

12:53.625 --> 12:56.560
What have you been doing?

12:56.661 --> 12:58.729
Come here.

13:10.608 --> 13:13.576
You are... wet, my lady.

13:13.678 --> 13:15.579
Uh...

13:15.647 --> 13:19.283
I am, my lord.
Rain will do that.

13:22.889 --> 13:25.491
I would have my wife dry

13:25.592 --> 13:27.493
before dinner.

13:27.594 --> 13:29.699
Yes, my lord.

13:29.724 --> 13:31.160
And I would not
see her wet again.

13:35.268 --> 13:36.868
That young groom...

13:38.337 --> 13:40.505
Paolo, my lord?

13:40.573 --> 13:42.674
I would speak
with him tomorrow.

13:52.350 --> 13:55.486
Your cousin's Dukedom
of Milan is now host

13:55.553 --> 13:57.421
to the arms of
King Charles of France.

13:57.522 --> 13:59.423
Not for long, I would imagine.

13:59.524 --> 14:02.426
Indeed. He is allowing
free passage of the armies

14:02.527 --> 14:04.429
through his
territories, south.

14:04.530 --> 14:06.864
Well, we must all pray
for deliverance, then.

14:08.334 --> 14:11.069
And how does he imagine the
pope will regard this betrayal?

14:11.170 --> 14:12.604
Betrayal?

14:12.672 --> 14:15.575
I was told that
the armies of France

14:15.642 --> 14:17.710
threaten Naples,
not the Holy City of Rome.

14:17.811 --> 14:21.114
So, they will
pass through Rome,

14:21.182 --> 14:24.052
if they get this far, and leave
the Holy City as it was.

14:24.153 --> 14:27.388
What other outcome
could one wish for?

14:27.489 --> 14:29.380
I think you know,
Cardinal Sforza,

14:29.405 --> 14:31.305
that Cardinal Della Rovere
has but one end in view:

14:31.326 --> 14:34.628
The deposition of our
Holy Father, the Pope.

14:34.730 --> 14:37.598
Yes, a grave
matter, indeed.

14:37.699 --> 14:41.602
And with few precedents.
And your attitude to this possibility?

14:41.670 --> 14:44.037
I myself voted
for the Holy Father.

14:44.105 --> 14:46.169
So he can count on your
continued support, then?

14:46.194 --> 14:47.594
Yes, of course.

14:50.010 --> 14:52.779
What else would
you say to me, his son?

14:52.846 --> 14:54.780
Indeed.

14:54.848 --> 14:57.616
What else, Cardinal Borgia?
What else?

14:57.684 --> 15:00.786
You would be wise
to be steadfast

15:00.853 --> 15:02.988
in this matter, Cardinal.

15:03.055 --> 15:05.957
You have another cousin
married to my sister.

15:06.025 --> 15:09.161
He would be wise to
remain steadfast too.

15:09.229 --> 15:11.797
Shall I tell him that,

15:11.898 --> 15:14.066
or should you?

15:15.535 --> 15:18.004
Or should we leave
that responsibility

15:18.072 --> 15:21.608
to your sister, Lucrezia?

15:29.951 --> 15:32.986
You would speak
with the groom, my lord?

15:33.087 --> 15:35.522
I would, my lady.

15:35.589 --> 15:38.357
- My lady.
- What of, might I ask?

15:38.425 --> 15:41.260
I'd have him
ready my horses.

15:41.327 --> 15:43.195
I must return
to the saddle.

15:43.263 --> 15:45.364
My lord.

15:47.266 --> 15:50.202
Are you sure
that is wise, my lord?

15:50.269 --> 15:53.339
My leg, thank God,
is healing.

15:54.808 --> 15:57.643
As we may confirm tonight.

15:59.213 --> 16:02.648
- Tonight?
- Tonight.

16:02.716 --> 16:04.817
I have slept alone
too long.

16:48.531 --> 16:49.932
My lady.

16:50.033 --> 16:51.667
My lord.

16:56.339 --> 16:57.839
You are a vision.

16:59.342 --> 17:00.742
Even for a Borgia?

17:00.810 --> 17:03.145
Your beauty was
never in question.

17:03.246 --> 17:05.146
Merely your breeding.

17:05.248 --> 17:07.648
And speaking of breeding,

17:07.717 --> 17:11.118
the entire principality will
be expecting an heir soon...

17:11.186 --> 17:13.855
So soon?

17:16.325 --> 17:19.060
And we mustn't disappoint
them, must we?

17:20.863 --> 17:22.931
My lord!

17:25.001 --> 17:27.703
Here, let me help you.

17:30.974 --> 17:34.043
Oh, I'm sorry, my lord.

17:37.147 --> 17:39.950
No! So! So!

17:42.988 --> 17:46.524
The French armies are headed
for the walled city of Lucca.

17:46.625 --> 17:50.528
And they must pass
Lucca to get to Rome?

17:50.595 --> 17:53.698
Hm. And Lucca
will provide no contest.

17:56.268 --> 17:59.537
Perhaps the leg
of our beloved Italy

17:59.605 --> 18:01.705
will provide some solace.

18:01.773 --> 18:04.675
- No, Rodrigo.
- What?

18:06.311 --> 18:08.978
Are we forbidden Naples?

18:10.781 --> 18:13.049
And the hills of Rome?

18:13.116 --> 18:15.251
Not to speak of

18:15.352 --> 18:19.321
Florence and Milan?

18:19.388 --> 18:21.956
It's that time
of the month,

18:22.024 --> 18:23.491
Rodrigo.

18:23.559 --> 18:25.492
Ah!

18:25.560 --> 18:27.962
We are denied
entry, then. Hm.

18:28.030 --> 18:30.131
So it seems.

18:31.533 --> 18:34.235
Most men consider it unclean.

18:34.303 --> 18:36.537
But we are not most men,

18:36.638 --> 18:38.873
Giulia Farnese.

18:44.814 --> 18:47.416
Let us hope this blood

18:47.484 --> 18:49.551
is not a portent.

19:41.904 --> 19:44.572
They would open
their gates to you, my liege.

19:44.640 --> 19:48.309
But they would
first discuss terms.

19:49.812 --> 19:52.480
Let us show them terms.

19:54.984 --> 19:57.218
- Fire!
- Fire the cannons!

20:30.050 --> 20:32.017
Those are my terms.

20:32.085 --> 20:35.954
Captains!
Forward!

20:39.426 --> 20:41.493
<i>A l'attaque!</i>

21:11.560 --> 21:14.796
Should I order restraint,
my liege?

21:14.897 --> 21:17.131
No, give
them their head.

21:17.232 --> 21:20.602
Pillage the place.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.701
But what can justify
such carnage?

21:56.803 --> 21:59.438
It is war, Cardinal,
plain and simple.

21:59.505 --> 22:01.807
They would have surrendered
to you, readily.

22:01.908 --> 22:05.878
As the whole of Italy
will surrender to me now.

22:28.704 --> 22:30.804
<i>I see castles aflame.</i>

22:30.906 --> 22:33.107
<i>I see blood</i>

22:33.208 --> 22:37.244
<i>running through</i>
<i>the streets of cities.</i>

22:37.312 --> 22:41.181
<i>Will you be the one,</i>
<i>Cardinal Della Rovere,</i>

22:41.249 --> 22:43.716
to bring forth this apocalypse?

22:43.784 --> 22:45.718
Are you...

22:45.786 --> 22:48.187
the cleric in red?

23:02.972 --> 23:06.208
You are eating
nothing, Cardinal?

23:07.644 --> 23:09.912
I find it hard, my liege,

23:09.980 --> 23:12.481
to muster an appetite.

23:12.582 --> 23:14.016
Perhaps I should retire.

23:14.084 --> 23:17.653
No! I shall not allow it.

23:17.720 --> 23:20.556
You invited us to this carnage.

23:20.657 --> 23:23.292
You shall at the very least
partake of it with us.

23:23.360 --> 23:26.562
- But, my liege--
- Yes, you will dine with us!

23:26.663 --> 23:29.665
You will not retire!

23:29.767 --> 23:32.668
An army is like
a beast, Cardinal.

23:32.736 --> 23:35.639
And that beast
will be fed!

23:37.909 --> 23:41.111
You think these troops
live on what I pay them?

23:41.212 --> 23:43.380
You think they march with me

23:43.481 --> 23:46.383
for the few sous I give them?

23:46.451 --> 23:48.285
No.

23:48.353 --> 23:51.121
They march for
the spoils of war,

23:51.222 --> 23:53.223
of victory.

23:55.126 --> 23:57.127
- Of course.
- Victory.

24:02.100 --> 24:05.035
This town will be picked clean
by the time the sun comes up.

24:05.102 --> 24:07.137
And do you know why, Cardinal?

24:07.238 --> 24:10.841
Because they know that another
assault like this will not be...

24:10.908 --> 24:13.944
necessary, that the news of it

24:14.045 --> 24:17.515
will spread like flames
through a barn,

24:17.582 --> 24:19.951
that they might not
get another chance.

24:20.052 --> 24:23.155
Ah! And they were so
looking forward to Florence.

24:23.256 --> 24:26.492
You think Florence
might resist us?

24:26.593 --> 24:28.562
After tonight,
I doubt it.

24:28.629 --> 24:31.131
But we live in hope,

24:31.232 --> 24:33.134
do we not, Cardinal?

24:33.235 --> 24:35.503
Can I make a request
then, my liege?

24:35.604 --> 24:39.239
We are... all ears, Cardinal.

24:39.340 --> 24:41.608
That I be granted
your gracious permission

24:41.709 --> 24:44.579
to ride before
your armies to Florence.

24:44.646 --> 24:47.215
That I negotiate whatever
terms are acceptable

24:47.283 --> 24:49.250
to Your Gracious Highness

24:49.318 --> 24:53.221
that might prevent a
recurrence of such slaughter.

24:55.124 --> 24:57.992
He has no stomach
for slaughter.

24:58.093 --> 25:00.327
General, what
are our terms?

25:00.428 --> 25:02.529
Free passage
of our troops

25:02.630 --> 25:05.131
through the
Florentine Republic.

25:05.199 --> 25:09.134
25,000 troops billeted on
the Florentine population.

25:09.202 --> 25:12.437
A levy of 200,000 ducats

25:12.538 --> 25:14.774
for the cost
of our armies to date.

25:14.841 --> 25:17.777
You would have them pay for
your invasion of their republic?

25:17.844 --> 25:20.179
200,000 is still out
of pocket, my liege.

25:20.280 --> 25:23.315
Your costs are
double that, to date.

25:23.383 --> 25:25.985
- 400,000 then.
- And, my liege,

25:26.052 --> 25:27.987
I would demand,

25:28.054 --> 25:31.223
as a token of good
faith, hostages

25:31.291 --> 25:34.360
from each of the major
Florentine families.

25:37.465 --> 25:41.068
Those demands are unaccountably
harsh, Your Highness.

25:41.135 --> 25:43.504
They may not
accede to them.

25:43.572 --> 25:45.006
Well, then,

25:45.073 --> 25:47.909
we look forward to battle.

25:47.977 --> 25:50.645
<i>And I looked up...</i>

25:50.746 --> 25:53.014
<i>and before me was a pale horse</i>

25:53.115 --> 25:56.550
<i>and its rider was named Death.</i>

25:56.651 --> 25:59.719
He had power over
a quarter of the earth

25:59.820 --> 26:02.922
to kill with his sword,

26:03.023 --> 26:04.924
with famine, with plague,

26:04.991 --> 26:08.827
and with the wild
beasts of the earth!

26:08.928 --> 26:11.263
And the moon,

26:11.364 --> 26:12.931
the full moon

26:12.999 --> 26:15.567
was red, and stars

26:15.669 --> 26:18.104
fell from the skies!

26:18.171 --> 26:20.439
And the sky,

26:20.507 --> 26:23.109
the sky receded,

26:23.210 --> 26:25.345
receded like a scroll,

26:25.412 --> 26:27.347
turning over and over,

26:27.414 --> 26:29.649
and mountains

26:29.717 --> 26:31.651
and islands

26:31.719 --> 26:34.353
were torn

26:34.421 --> 26:37.190
from the face
of the earth!

26:38.592 --> 26:41.528
The sun turned black!

26:41.596 --> 26:45.299
Black as sackcloth!

26:54.009 --> 26:55.909
I bring news, Father,

26:55.977 --> 26:58.479
of apocalypse.

26:59.948 --> 27:02.383
Hm.

27:02.450 --> 27:04.652
If you can still hear me.

27:10.592 --> 27:13.394
The French King has
laid waste to Lucca.

27:13.462 --> 27:15.863
His armies head
towards Florence.

27:15.931 --> 27:18.032
But their goal...

27:18.100 --> 27:20.601
is your fair
Kingdom of Naples...

27:22.571 --> 27:24.639
which we may need to vacate.

27:26.308 --> 27:27.876
Father.

27:30.179 --> 27:32.014
Father,

27:32.081 --> 27:34.149
I need at least a sign.

28:07.517 --> 28:10.920
...per omnia
saecula saeculorum.

28:10.987 --> 28:12.588
Amen.

28:14.857 --> 28:18.794
You have heard what happened
in Lucca, my son?

28:18.862 --> 28:21.797
The whole world
has heard, Father.

28:24.701 --> 28:27.969
King Ferrante has died.

28:28.070 --> 28:30.238
Indeed.

28:31.707 --> 28:34.309
And did he die repentant?

28:34.376 --> 28:37.712
He has been dead for years,
to sense and logic.

28:39.981 --> 28:42.416
But the throne of Naples
is free at last.

28:42.484 --> 28:44.417
Alfonso will demand
its investiture.

28:44.485 --> 28:46.719
Well, the French King
demands it too.

28:48.155 --> 28:50.089
His army heads to Florence.

28:50.157 --> 28:52.725
Well, we must muster
what forces we can.

28:52.826 --> 28:55.094
And what forces are they?

28:55.196 --> 28:58.632
The armies of the papal
states. Of the Sforzas.

28:58.733 --> 29:02.003
The great lords
of the Romagna.

29:02.104 --> 29:04.339
And you think they
can resist French arms?

29:04.440 --> 29:06.875
They are all
the forces we have.

29:06.943 --> 29:08.910
Under what leadership?

29:08.978 --> 29:12.347
Of the Gonfaloniere, the
Duke of Gandia, Juan Borgia.

29:12.448 --> 29:15.350
You are blinded
by affection, Father.

29:19.254 --> 29:22.089
Can you suggest
an alternative?

29:23.558 --> 29:25.826
Father, Father...

29:25.894 --> 29:29.829
Give me control of them.
I will do what is necessary.

29:29.897 --> 29:32.732
You have no experience
of battle, my son.

29:32.800 --> 29:34.735
- Does Juan?
- Yes.

29:34.836 --> 29:36.903
He's been bred
for this moment.

29:36.971 --> 29:39.440
His whole life has been spent
in training for such an event.

29:39.507 --> 29:41.909
He's played at
games of war, Father.

29:41.977 --> 29:43.811
He has yet to
experience reality.

29:43.879 --> 29:46.914
Well, he'll have the
condottieri to advise him.

29:49.919 --> 29:52.821
If Florence resists
French arms,

29:52.922 --> 29:55.658
then we may
yet have time.

29:57.094 --> 29:59.195
And you think they will?

30:06.972 --> 30:09.841
We will excommunicate
Florence

30:09.909 --> 30:12.210
if the French armies
are admitted.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.748
Excommunicate the entire city,

30:16.849 --> 30:18.449
Your Holiness?

30:18.517 --> 30:21.920
The Medicis, the
Pazzis, Machiavelli,

30:22.021 --> 30:23.921
the whole Signoria.

30:26.024 --> 30:28.359
And we will have
that Savonarola burnt.

30:28.427 --> 30:32.397
We will bear no more
opposition to our word.

30:32.465 --> 30:35.801
Then you must excommunicate
half of Christendom.

30:35.826 --> 30:36.667
Indeed.

30:36.728 --> 30:38.563
Because half of
the world is against us.

30:39.004 --> 30:41.172
We will not
tolerate this heresy!

30:41.207 --> 30:43.575
This apostasy!

30:43.676 --> 30:45.777
This is the chair
of St. Peter's!

30:45.845 --> 30:48.113
We are the voice
of the Living God!

30:48.180 --> 30:51.949
We will occupy this chair until
our death, and the fires of Hell

30:52.017 --> 30:54.419
shall rain down on those
who would oppose us!

30:59.090 --> 31:02.759
We are, all of us...

31:04.763 --> 31:06.830
about to be

31:06.898 --> 31:08.965
sorely tested.

31:11.669 --> 31:13.670
And you...

31:13.738 --> 31:15.605
are either with us...

31:17.108 --> 31:18.875
or against us.

31:22.313 --> 31:24.247
We hereby impose

31:24.315 --> 31:26.415
an excommunication

31:26.483 --> 31:28.584
upon that...

31:28.685 --> 31:32.387
heretic apostate...

31:34.157 --> 31:36.291
Cardinal Guiliano

31:36.359 --> 31:37.959
Della Rovere.

31:42.031 --> 31:44.399
We ask for
your support

31:44.467 --> 31:47.169
in this most solemn

31:47.270 --> 31:49.938
declaration.

31:52.208 --> 31:55.444
We demand your compliance, so...

31:57.514 --> 32:01.083
a show of hands, Your Eminences.

32:04.787 --> 32:07.356
If you please.

32:16.433 --> 32:19.435
Your Holiness, may
the vice-chancellor speak?

32:21.238 --> 32:23.172
Yes...

32:23.240 --> 32:25.341
Cardinal Sforza.

32:25.409 --> 32:27.443
He may.

32:31.481 --> 32:33.549
It would be unwise...

32:35.952 --> 32:39.054
to use the Church's
most solemn sanction...

32:40.457 --> 32:42.524
to so little effect.

32:43.893 --> 32:46.362
What does the
vice-chancellor mean?

32:46.429 --> 32:49.831
Excommunication or not,

32:49.933 --> 32:52.834
this invasion
will proceed.

32:54.303 --> 32:58.373
We may all have to adjust
ourselves to new realities.

33:12.188 --> 33:14.456
You should consider
it fortunate, my lady,

33:14.557 --> 33:16.558
that you're a
Borgia no longer.

33:18.061 --> 33:19.928
What does my lord mean?

33:20.029 --> 33:22.631
The French army has
passed through Milan.

33:22.733 --> 33:24.656
My cousin Ludovico has
given them

33:24.681 --> 33:25.881
free passage
through his dukedom.

33:26.037 --> 33:28.839
If the Republic of Florence
doesn't resist their advance,

33:28.940 --> 33:31.542
there will be nothing to stop
their passage towards Rome.

33:32.944 --> 33:35.445
I know little of politics.

33:35.513 --> 33:37.689
You know enough,
surely, to know

33:37.714 --> 33:39.126
that your father's
days may be numbered.

33:40.384 --> 33:43.854
I will always be
my father's daughter, sire.

33:43.955 --> 33:47.757
And unless I am
very much mistaken,

33:47.858 --> 33:50.660
I do believe the
Sforza armies, yours

33:50.728 --> 33:53.296
and your cousin Catherina's
were pledged to his cause.

33:53.397 --> 33:56.132
That promise did form part
of the betrothal arrangement.

33:56.233 --> 33:58.735
And my lord would never
renege on a promise.

33:58.802 --> 34:02.104
My cousin Catherina
already has.

34:04.240 --> 34:06.174
But you, my lord,

34:06.241 --> 34:08.208
would never be so...

34:08.275 --> 34:10.311
dishonourable.

34:10.411 --> 34:12.013
Is it dishonourable

34:12.080 --> 34:15.016
to assist in the deposition
of a Borgia pope?

34:15.083 --> 34:17.185
As dishonourable,
perhaps,

34:17.253 --> 34:20.021
as removing a litter of swine
from the Vatican walls.

34:20.121 --> 34:22.123
You are ill, my lady?

34:25.161 --> 34:27.463
Perhaps your words offend me.

34:27.530 --> 34:30.132
Forgive me, then,
for speaking so plainly.

34:30.233 --> 34:34.135
But understand that if Florence
admits the French armies,

34:34.203 --> 34:38.040
then the Sforza arms
may march with France.

34:43.414 --> 34:45.315
It is unwise, my lord,

34:45.416 --> 34:47.384
to upset me thus.

34:47.452 --> 34:49.786
Ah...
My lady!

34:52.389 --> 34:53.924
Come.

34:57.194 --> 34:58.962
Straight away...

35:03.600 --> 35:05.968
Who can we trust...

35:08.638 --> 35:11.339
in this charnel house
called Rome?

35:13.142 --> 35:14.977
You can trust me.

35:22.953 --> 35:25.154
The Sforzas of Milan...

35:25.256 --> 35:27.791
have deserted us.

35:30.594 --> 35:33.697
I wonder, will the Sforzas
of Pesaro do the same?

35:33.798 --> 35:36.196
Your daughter, who
married one, would know.

35:36.221 --> 35:37.804
But I hear nothing from her.

35:39.070 --> 35:42.072
I wonder, would you
travel to Pesaro,

35:42.173 --> 35:44.441
find out what she knows?

35:44.509 --> 35:46.410
Gladly.

35:51.350 --> 35:55.019
We will miss you,
in our hour of need.

35:55.120 --> 35:57.354
And I will miss you.

36:00.291 --> 36:02.693
But I will suffer
your absence,

36:02.761 --> 36:04.795
if it sets your
mind at ease.

36:06.798 --> 36:08.699
There was a confessor I had

36:08.767 --> 36:11.001
when I first took holy orders.

36:11.102 --> 36:14.370
A Franciscan friar,
the most holy of men.

36:15.773 --> 36:18.340
I would emerge
from his confessional...

36:19.943 --> 36:24.012
like a boy newly washed
in the morning dew.

36:25.481 --> 36:28.883
Untroubled. Clear.

36:30.286 --> 36:33.655
We long for that clarity
in this moment of time.

36:43.734 --> 36:46.102
Summon him to Rome, then.

36:48.072 --> 36:50.474
While I ride to Pesaro.

36:55.680 --> 36:58.281
The French King demands
that Florence be opened

36:58.349 --> 37:00.116
to the passage of his armies.

37:00.217 --> 37:01.918
But of course.

37:02.019 --> 37:04.822
25,000 troops be
billeted on its populace.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.824
That will need to be
voted by the Signoria.

37:06.925 --> 37:08.826
You heard what
happened in Lucca.

37:08.927 --> 37:12.896
- Is that a yes?
- Yes.

37:14.332 --> 37:17.301
He demands a levy
of 400,000 ducats

37:17.402 --> 37:19.469
for the cost of
his invasion so far.

37:19.570 --> 37:23.106
My God! What effrontery.

37:23.207 --> 37:26.275
- The answer is yes.
- Yes?

37:26.343 --> 37:28.577
We must pay for the privilege
of being invaded?

37:28.678 --> 37:31.313
You heard what
happened in Lucca.

37:31.414 --> 37:34.282
What happened in Lucca sounds
increasingly like genius.

37:34.350 --> 37:37.285
He demands hostages
from the following families

37:37.353 --> 37:38.954
as a token of goodwill.

37:39.022 --> 37:40.589
Medici.

37:42.325 --> 37:44.126
Yes.

37:44.227 --> 37:46.662
- Pazzi.
- Yes.

37:46.763 --> 37:49.999
- Gilberti.
- Yes.

37:54.672 --> 37:56.940
And now, my Lord Medici,
that you've surrendered

37:57.041 --> 37:59.009
the Republic of Florence,

37:59.077 --> 38:01.278
can we at least
pour the wine?

38:10.456 --> 38:13.858
There is genius
afoot here, Cardinal.

38:15.360 --> 38:17.828
Is it yours?

38:17.896 --> 38:21.331
Have you ever witnessed
carnage, Ambassador?

38:24.735 --> 38:26.969
Let's drink then.

38:28.939 --> 38:31.207
To the great God, carnage.

38:50.194 --> 38:53.763
I have heard a whisper of
your excommunication, Cardinal.

38:53.831 --> 38:55.965
Indeed. I have heard
the same of yours.

38:56.033 --> 38:58.234
Mine?

38:58.302 --> 39:00.703
I've heard rumours
that the whole of Florence

39:00.805 --> 39:02.605
could be excommunicated

39:02.673 --> 39:05.142
if this city is surrendered
to French arms.

39:05.209 --> 39:07.277
Well, then,

39:07.378 --> 39:09.980
perhaps that depends
on one's definition

39:10.081 --> 39:12.582
of surrender.

39:19.690 --> 39:22.058
Regiment, halt!

39:22.160 --> 39:23.893
I bid his
Royal Highness

39:23.961 --> 39:25.995
and the armies of France

39:26.063 --> 39:28.999
welcome to the fair
city of Florence.

39:30.501 --> 39:32.134
But it would be politic,

39:32.202 --> 39:36.072
Your Highness, if you would ride
through our gracious city

39:36.173 --> 39:38.641
with your lance at rest.

39:40.843 --> 39:42.277
At rest?

39:42.345 --> 39:46.180
Your lance at point
is a symbol of conquest,

39:46.281 --> 39:49.917
and our gracious Florence
has not been conquered.

39:50.018 --> 39:51.886
To the contrary.

39:51.954 --> 39:55.891
We welcome you
with open arms.

40:07.205 --> 40:09.807
Signor Machiavelli.

40:09.908 --> 40:11.809
Your Highness?

40:11.910 --> 40:13.544
Our lance at rest

40:13.645 --> 40:17.549
prevents our entry
to your fair city.

40:17.616 --> 40:19.718
Perhaps,
Your Highness,

40:19.785 --> 40:22.454
if it were to be
angled backwards.

40:22.521 --> 40:26.024
And of what would
that be a symbol?

40:26.092 --> 40:30.027
Of Your Highness'
infinite resourcefulness.

40:30.128 --> 40:31.829
Ah.

40:42.707 --> 40:44.642
Onward, forward!

40:46.344 --> 40:48.111
Onward, forward!

40:48.212 --> 40:50.981
Company march!

41:12.103 --> 41:14.204
- My lady.
- Am I in the right place?

41:14.271 --> 41:16.473
Residence of
Lucrezia Borgia?

41:17.942 --> 41:19.376
Sforza.

41:19.443 --> 41:21.544
Sforza.

41:40.431 --> 41:42.932
The Lady Giulia
Farnese, my lord.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.968
La Bella Farnese.

41:46.036 --> 41:49.137
May I introduce my cousin,
Catherina Sforza.

41:50.907 --> 41:52.841
Your reputation
precedes you.

41:52.908 --> 41:55.943
And the tales of
your military prowess.

41:56.011 --> 41:59.580
- These are troubled times.
- Indeed they are.

41:59.648 --> 42:02.249
And the one I came to see?

42:02.350 --> 42:04.251
Your dear wife, Lucrezia?

42:04.352 --> 42:06.753
She is indisposed.

42:06.821 --> 42:08.855
Nothing serious, I hope.

42:08.956 --> 42:11.524
The politics of our
Italy have unnerved her.

42:11.625 --> 42:14.027
They have unnerved us all.

42:15.463 --> 42:18.934
You... have the pope's ear,

42:19.001 --> 42:21.870
Giulia Farnese.

42:24.174 --> 42:27.076
At certain times.

42:28.979 --> 42:31.247
So, enlighten us.

42:32.649 --> 42:35.250
Will he resist
this French invasion?

42:35.318 --> 42:38.721
Will he bring
bloodshed and carnage

42:38.822 --> 42:40.890
upon all our heads?

42:40.991 --> 42:44.160
You are no stranger to
bloodshed, are you, Lady Sforza?

42:44.227 --> 42:47.596
I would save my arms
for battles I can win.

42:49.065 --> 42:51.967
If you're asking me, will
he accept his deposition

42:52.035 --> 42:54.136
as the Pope of Rome...

42:55.539 --> 42:57.440
the answer is never.

42:57.508 --> 43:01.278
With what armies will he
confront the French?

43:01.379 --> 43:03.547
With the armies of
the papal states.

43:03.615 --> 43:06.718
Of the lords of the
Romagna. The Colonna.

43:06.785 --> 43:08.820
The Salviati. The Sforza.

43:08.888 --> 43:11.990
Oh, we're all doomed then.

43:12.057 --> 43:13.625
No.

43:13.726 --> 43:17.629
No, the House
of Borgia is doomed.

43:17.696 --> 43:20.532
The arms of the
House of Sforza

43:20.600 --> 43:22.467
will remain where they belong:

43:22.568 --> 43:24.536
In the Romagna.

43:24.603 --> 43:27.706
But what of my
lord's marriage...

43:27.773 --> 43:30.509
with the House
of Borgia?

43:30.576 --> 43:32.810
What of it?

43:32.912 --> 43:35.280
You will let these
French armies

43:35.348 --> 43:37.816
march to Rome, and do...

43:37.884 --> 43:40.552
What everyone else
in Italy is doing.

43:40.620 --> 43:42.020
Nothing.

43:42.121 --> 43:44.156
Ah.

43:45.558 --> 43:48.527
Have you shared
this intelligence

43:48.595 --> 43:50.562
with your dear
wife, Lucrezia?

43:50.630 --> 43:54.266
She's too young to
understand such matters.

44:20.962 --> 44:23.730
Do you recognise us,
Brother Raphael?

44:23.798 --> 44:25.833
Oh...

44:27.802 --> 44:30.838
I hardly do, Your Holiness.

44:46.721 --> 44:48.755
I would be...

44:50.257 --> 44:52.291
a simple priest again,

44:54.061 --> 44:56.462
and unburden
my soul to you.

45:02.337 --> 45:04.237
I have been...

45:04.305 --> 45:06.873
diverted from my calling...

45:12.680 --> 45:15.582
by the travails
of this world.

45:17.152 --> 45:19.420
That is indeed grave.

45:19.488 --> 45:22.691
But the pope
is a ruler of men.

45:25.161 --> 45:27.763
Yes, he interprets God's will,

45:27.830 --> 45:30.866
but he must also rule
the papal states,

45:30.933 --> 45:34.135
the city of Rome,
he must mediate between

45:34.236 --> 45:36.671
all the kings
of Christendom.

45:36.738 --> 45:39.206
God makes
himself manifest

45:39.274 --> 45:40.975
through the world.

45:41.042 --> 45:44.411
He does not ask us to change it,

45:44.479 --> 45:47.681
merely to lead good lives.

45:51.954 --> 45:53.888
A great trial...

45:53.956 --> 45:56.424
is to be visited on me.

45:56.492 --> 46:00.062
On Rome, on the chair
of St. Peter's.

46:00.129 --> 46:01.597
The French King,

46:01.664 --> 46:03.699
a cardinal with him,

46:03.767 --> 46:07.070
would see me deposed.

46:07.137 --> 46:09.039
Now, if that is God's will,

46:09.106 --> 46:11.708
should I just
allow it to happen?

46:11.775 --> 46:14.343
Walk free of my office...

46:16.613 --> 46:18.713
follow you to the Apennines,

46:18.781 --> 46:21.816
and live the life
of St. Francis?

46:21.917 --> 46:24.785
You were given
this office for a reason,

46:24.853 --> 46:27.721
Your Holiness.
Are you sure of that, Friar?

46:27.822 --> 46:29.256
You were chosen.

46:29.323 --> 46:32.359
You have a duty to fulfill.

46:33.796 --> 46:37.732
You're a man. You
have sinned, of course.

46:37.800 --> 46:40.368
You have failed,
no doubt,

46:40.470 --> 46:42.738
in many things.

46:42.839 --> 46:44.974
But your office,

46:45.042 --> 46:47.910
the role for which
God chose you,

46:48.011 --> 46:50.447
you cannot fail in that.

46:50.514 --> 46:53.249
And, have no doubt,

46:53.317 --> 46:56.352
God observes you.

46:56.420 --> 46:59.522
And if you open
your heart to Him...

47:00.925 --> 47:03.292
He will guide
you through it.

47:04.761 --> 47:08.196
Now, beg forgiveness

47:08.264 --> 47:10.365
for your sins,

47:10.433 --> 47:13.635
and have your soul
washed clean.

47:21.111 --> 47:23.379
Djem is in my
dreams again, Giulia.

47:23.481 --> 47:25.849
And he still
cannot speak.

47:28.453 --> 47:31.655
Can one contract the marsh fever
in these mountainous regions?

47:33.458 --> 47:36.026
I'm sure the mountains
have fevers of their own,

47:36.127 --> 47:38.195
but I know them not.

47:39.631 --> 47:42.900
But you are ill, Lucrezia.
Describe your illness.

47:44.669 --> 47:47.104
I wake up, nauseous.

47:47.205 --> 47:50.474
I expel the contents of
whatever I ate the night before.

47:50.575 --> 47:52.109
I sweat.

47:52.176 --> 47:53.744
It comes and goes.

47:53.812 --> 47:55.746
When does it come and go?

47:55.814 --> 47:57.915
Mornings are the worst.

48:09.159 --> 48:12.662
Your husband...

48:12.763 --> 48:15.131
does he visit your
bed nightly?

48:15.199 --> 48:18.868
He had a hunting
accident, Giulia.

48:18.936 --> 48:21.871
He has slept alone
since his fall.

48:21.939 --> 48:24.507
How strange.

48:33.651 --> 48:36.586
We must leave this
castle at first light,

48:36.654 --> 48:40.290
before the Lord
Sforza awakes.

48:41.726 --> 48:44.795
Have you any friends you
can confide in here?

48:47.031 --> 48:49.967
- There is a maidservant.
- Mm-hmm.

48:50.035 --> 48:51.869
Francesca.

48:53.305 --> 48:55.039
There is a groom.

48:56.608 --> 48:58.609
Paolo.

49:00.078 --> 49:01.946
You can trust this groom?

49:02.013 --> 49:04.982
With my life.

49:10.656 --> 49:12.524
Hmm...

49:13.926 --> 49:16.061
He was kind to you, hmm?

49:17.931 --> 49:21.033
He was my only solace here.

49:22.969 --> 49:25.671
He can provide us
with horses then.

49:28.141 --> 49:30.176
You said it was strange.

49:31.946 --> 49:33.346
Why is it strange,

49:33.447 --> 49:35.349
Giulia Farnese?

49:35.450 --> 49:37.985
Because,
Lucrezia, my love...

49:40.455 --> 49:43.325
I recognise the symptoms
of your illness.

49:43.392 --> 49:46.261
And it's not called
marsh fever.

49:48.331 --> 49:50.365
You're with child.
