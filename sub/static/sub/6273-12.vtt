00:00.066 --> 00:01.734
Virginia:  <i>Previously on</i>
<i>masters of sex...</i>

00:01.736 --> 00:04.737
So, you consider
the relationship to have

00:04.739 --> 00:05.771
A higher purpose?

00:05.773 --> 00:07.439
We are uniquely qualified

00:07.441 --> 00:08.340
<i>To develop a treatment,</i>

00:08.342 --> 00:11.176
<i>To prevent</i>
<i>countless marriages</i>
<i>from dissolving.</i>

00:11.178 --> 00:13.879
Cannot present
ourselves as the saviors

00:13.881 --> 00:15.147
Of the sexually
dysfunctional

00:15.149 --> 00:17.850
Without having cured
a single patient first,

00:17.852 --> 00:18.450
Including me.

00:18.452 --> 00:22.921
The two of you
could finally
teach america

00:22.923 --> 00:24.223
How to have sex.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.758
On...Television?

00:25.760 --> 00:28.927
I don't know
why I...Want what I want,

00:28.929 --> 00:30.562
But if you would...
What?

00:30.564 --> 00:33.932
Kiss me, then maybe
I could figure it out.

00:35.568 --> 00:36.769
I have a...

00:36.771 --> 00:38.404
(stammering) a condition.

00:38.406 --> 00:39.938
I can't do anything
with a girl.

00:39.940 --> 00:42.908
Barbara: I...
I also have a condition.

00:42.910 --> 00:43.642
I got a gig.

00:43.644 --> 00:46.612
Six weeks
backing floyd desouza.

00:46.614 --> 00:48.080
We want the kids
to come, too.

00:48.082 --> 00:49.681
To europe?
Why not?

00:49.683 --> 00:50.482
No. My answer is no.

00:50.484 --> 00:53.552
So you would rather
that they come home
from school

00:53.554 --> 00:54.486
Every day to a babysitter

00:54.488 --> 00:58.190
And hope that they
can stay up late enough
to see their mother?

00:58.192 --> 01:00.192
You push back on this,

01:00.194 --> 01:02.027
On a reasonable request,

01:02.029 --> 01:04.630
You could be opening up
a whole can of worms.

01:04.632 --> 01:07.466
I don't think
you want to do that.

01:16.409 --> 01:20.412
Virginia:  <i>I feel</i>
<i>we may have stumbled upon</i>
<i>something interesting.</i>

01:20.414 --> 01:21.914
<i>That night,</i>
<i>after the camera crew left,</i>

01:21.916 --> 01:24.616
<i>That was the first time</i>
<i>that we had ever touched.</i>

01:24.618 --> 01:25.818
<i>Just touched.</i>

01:25.820 --> 01:30.022
Dr. Masters:
<i>Without the ulterior motive</i>
<i>for touching being sex...</i>

01:30.024 --> 01:32.157
<i>Even an attempt at sex.</i>

01:32.159 --> 01:33.892
Virginia:
<i>And then that other night</i>

01:33.894 --> 01:35.961
<i>When you were so upset</i>
<i>and vulnerable</i>

01:35.963 --> 01:38.163
<i>After the fight</i>
<i>with your brother,</i>

01:38.165 --> 01:41.533
<i>I comforted you</i>
<i>just by touching you.</i>

01:41.535 --> 01:44.470
Dr. Masters:
<i>And I was able to have sex.</i>

01:44.871 --> 01:47.773
(sighs)
given that...

01:48.341 --> 01:51.944
I think we have
to come at this with
a different approach.

01:56.983 --> 01:58.750
Intercourse off the table,

01:58.752 --> 02:00.352
But, also,

02:00.354 --> 02:02.588
The touching
of genitals.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.923
Also off the table.

02:04.925 --> 02:07.693
Nonsexual touching only.

03:00.280 --> 03:03.982
Well, you're
definitely aroused.
(sighs)

03:09.222 --> 03:09.821
(breathing heavily)

03:09.823 --> 03:12.925
So maybe now
is a good time to try.
(sighs)

03:19.499 --> 03:22.367
So, now what?

03:24.504 --> 03:27.606
All right, if...If we put
touching genitals

03:27.608 --> 03:28.574
Back on the agenda...

03:28.576 --> 03:30.409
But still stop
before actual sex.

03:30.411 --> 03:33.512
Right. No expectations
being key.

03:34.347 --> 03:37.749
Virginia: That seems
the logical next step.

03:40.253 --> 03:42.754
(romantic music plays)

03:47.360 --> 03:49.595
(breathing deeply)

03:57.103 --> 03:58.637
(breathing heavily)

04:05.178 --> 04:06.812
(moans)

04:08.514 --> 04:11.883
Virginia:  <i>We now know</i>
<i>sexual touching works.</i>

04:15.588 --> 04:18.090
(both breathing deeply)

04:19.926 --> 04:22.894
<i>Maybe we should continue</i>
<i>into actual sex.</i>

04:27.634 --> 04:29.701
Mmm.

04:33.873 --> 04:35.474
(sighs)

04:35.476 --> 04:37.676
Let me initiate first.

04:37.678 --> 04:38.777
And you just feel.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.313
Feel... Feel me.

04:42.048 --> 04:44.149
Feel your body.

05:00.533 --> 05:03.769
It's interesting if you look
at the progression.

05:03.771 --> 05:06.505
Seven nights
of nonsexual touching,

05:06.507 --> 05:07.639
Multiple erections.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.142
With a few
unmitigated disasters.

05:10.144 --> 05:10.575
But still.

05:10.577 --> 05:12.611
And then followed
by seven nights
of sexual touching.

05:12.613 --> 05:15.781
Again with
multiple erections
if you don't count...

05:15.783 --> 05:16.515
I don't.

05:16.517 --> 05:18.650
We're focusing
on the positive.

05:18.652 --> 05:23.221
And now we've had
seven nights
of successful...

05:23.223 --> 05:23.922
And successive...

05:23.924 --> 05:28.193
Yes, seven nights
of successive
and successful coitus.

05:28.195 --> 05:31.496
So, based on these results,

05:31.498 --> 05:36.201
At what point
can we consider you cured?

05:36.436 --> 05:38.036
(cheering on television)

05:38.038 --> 05:40.639

Dr. Masters:
You left the water on
in the shower.

08:14.193 --> 08:15.894
I did?

08:15.896 --> 08:17.963
How stupid of me.

08:17.965 --> 08:21.500
Uh, I'm going in today
to volunteer.

08:21.502 --> 08:22.801
At core?

08:22.803 --> 08:24.202
I thought
you'd given that up.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.637
The leadership
has been in atlanta,

08:25.639 --> 08:28.073
Protesting the arrest
of dr. King.

08:28.075 --> 08:28.874
They're back today,

08:28.876 --> 08:32.177
And, no,
I have not given it up.

08:32.245 --> 08:36.214
Your mother
should be here soon
to stay with the children.

08:36.749 --> 08:38.216
(child babbling)

08:38.218 --> 08:39.351
I love you.

08:39.353 --> 08:42.621
I love you both
so much, hmm?

08:42.623 --> 08:44.456
So, so much.

08:44.458 --> 08:47.526
(voice breaking)
you have no idea.
Mmm.

08:48.794 --> 08:50.762
(kisses)

08:50.897 --> 08:52.430
Hmm.

08:56.669 --> 08:59.104
(school bell ringing)

08:59.405 --> 09:00.639
Oh. Good.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.574
Miss braddock
is running late.

09:02.576 --> 09:03.608
Actually, you're late.

09:03.610 --> 09:05.110
Miss braddock's
on time.

09:05.112 --> 09:06.678
That's why she took
the other parents in,

09:06.680 --> 09:09.080
The ones who were
already here.
Oh.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.949
Well, they
must've been early,

09:10.951 --> 09:14.319
Trying to impress
miss braddock, no doubt.
(chuckles)

09:14.321 --> 09:16.154
Well, would that be
such a bad thing?

09:16.156 --> 09:19.124
I did see henry's
last report card.

09:22.962 --> 09:24.663
(sighs)

09:26.732 --> 09:29.834
Hey, I got a call
from johnnie j yesterday.

09:29.836 --> 09:32.437
He offered me a regular gig
at the cosmopolitan club.

09:32.439 --> 09:35.807
St. John's trio
is now playing there
four nights a week.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.208
Oh.

09:37.210 --> 09:38.176
First europe

09:38.178 --> 09:39.911
And now st. Louis.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.580
(chuckles softly)

09:42.615 --> 09:44.683
I've been thinking...

09:44.685 --> 09:47.586
What if the kids, uh,
spend a little more time

09:47.588 --> 09:49.621
At my place
during the week?

09:49.623 --> 09:51.089
Instead of just
the one night,

09:51.091 --> 09:51.923
Maybe two or even three?

09:51.925 --> 09:54.426
You just had them
for six weeks in europe.

09:54.428 --> 09:57.162
Yeah, and I've never
seen them happier.
Oh.

09:57.164 --> 09:59.864
Well, that's because
you hardly ever see them.

09:59.866 --> 10:02.133
My point, gin,
is to change that.

10:02.135 --> 10:02.734
And my point is

10:02.736 --> 10:07.772
Don't make me regret
giving you an inch,
george.

10:08.074 --> 10:08.974
I mean, seriously.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.076
Where is this all
coming from?

10:11.078 --> 10:11.543
Audrey?

10:11.545 --> 10:13.411
Why can't
I have changed?

10:13.413 --> 10:15.280
You have changed.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.715
Changed for audrey.

10:16.717 --> 10:17.582
And while I'm so pleased

10:17.584 --> 10:21.486
That she has managed
to acquaint you
with fatherhood

10:21.488 --> 10:23.221
In these past six months,

10:23.223 --> 10:24.222
Let's not forget
I'm the one

10:24.224 --> 10:26.424
Who has been here for them
since the beginning.

10:26.426 --> 10:29.561
All of the conferences
and the vacations

10:29.563 --> 10:32.564
And the sleepless nights
when they've been sick...

10:32.566 --> 10:33.031
Fine, okay,

10:33.033 --> 10:34.933
But let's not forget
that you've had
your own problems

10:34.935 --> 10:36.768
In the parent department.

10:37.703 --> 10:39.704
I mean,
we're being honest, right?

10:39.706 --> 10:43.408
Neither of us
is particularly great
parent material, gin.

10:43.410 --> 10:46.111
But you know who is?
Audrey.
(chuckles sarcastically)

10:46.113 --> 10:48.580
No, she loves
the kids.
(sighs)

10:48.582 --> 10:50.281
And she spends
more time with them

10:50.283 --> 10:51.282
Than either of us
put together.

10:51.284 --> 10:53.752
And don't our kids
deserve to have
at least one parent

10:53.754 --> 10:54.886
Who puts them first.
(sighs)

10:54.888 --> 10:58.757
No, I...
I am going to pretend
that I didn't hear that.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.258
Well, actually,
I want you to hear it.
No, george.

11:00.260 --> 11:05.630
You can have our kids
once a week like always,
as we've agreed.

11:05.632 --> 11:07.565
And while it is
your night tonight,

11:07.567 --> 11:08.767
You did just have them
for six weeks,

11:08.769 --> 11:11.169
So I'm going to keep them
at home with me tonight.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.371
What's that,
a punishment for
suggesting something

11:13.373 --> 11:14.539
That might actually
be good for the kids?

11:14.541 --> 11:17.142
Virginia:
Shh! Miss braddock!
The johnsons are here.

11:19.311 --> 11:22.047
Oh, I...
I don't need tissues,
thank you.

11:22.049 --> 11:24.716
This is, uh,
it's a small matter really.

11:24.718 --> 11:27.585
As you know,
I share custody
of my children

11:27.587 --> 11:28.853
With my ex-husband, george.

11:28.855 --> 11:31.823
Oh, how was
the european tour?

11:32.658 --> 11:35.326
Fine, I suppose.

11:35.328 --> 11:36.795
But I'm here because I...

11:36.797 --> 11:39.898
I may have been
a bit sloppy

11:39.900 --> 11:42.667
When I dissolved
our marriage.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.369
Sloppy?
Yes.

11:44.371 --> 11:48.173
You see, george
never even wanted children.

11:48.175 --> 11:49.107
Not even
from the beginning.

11:49.109 --> 11:53.044
And so when it
came time to finalize
a custody agreement...

11:53.046 --> 11:56.548
You don't have
a signed one. Ugh.

11:56.649 --> 11:59.150
(sighs)
well, it just...

11:59.152 --> 12:01.519
It seemed irrelevant
(chuckles) at the time.

12:01.521 --> 12:04.255
But now he's found jesus.

12:04.957 --> 12:06.825
Audrey.

12:06.992 --> 12:07.792
My point is,

12:07.794 --> 12:10.161
George will back off
quickly enough

12:10.163 --> 12:13.364
When he's confronted
with an actual lawyer,

12:13.366 --> 12:14.799
Which I do think
is important

12:14.801 --> 12:16.701
Now that there is
a new wife in the picture.

12:16.703 --> 12:19.504
Hmm. New wives
are like francium...

12:19.506 --> 12:23.575
The most unstable
of all the elements.

12:23.577 --> 12:24.876
You dabble in chemistry?

12:24.878 --> 12:26.778
Eh, in another life.
(chuckles)

12:26.780 --> 12:31.082
A life where I thought
there was order
to the universe.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.717
Now I know better.

12:32.719 --> 12:35.887
So, now
I get contracts signed.

12:40.059 --> 12:41.593

<i>a million people living...</i>

12:47.667 --> 12:49.801
Is this for
the st. Louis
tourist board?

12:49.803 --> 12:51.636
(chuckles)
I'm sure they're just
setting the stage.

12:51.638 --> 12:54.873
The idea was to
ease the audience
into the subject matter.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.975
<i>There are many</i>
<i>building blocks to</i>
<i>a prosperous society,</i>

12:56.977 --> 12:58.977

<i>A strong, happy union</i>
<i>between a man and a woman</i>

13:01.982 --> 13:03.782
<i>Is crucial</i>
<i>to both the family unit</i>

13:03.784 --> 13:05.383
<i>And to the community</i>
<i>at large.</i>

13:05.385 --> 13:08.286
<i>But what makes</i>
<i>a happy marriage?</i>

13:08.288 --> 13:08.987
<i>To answer the question,</i>

13:08.989 --> 13:11.189
<i>What kind of changes</i>
<i>occur physically</i>

13:11.191 --> 13:13.291
<i>During moments</i>
<i>of marital intimacy?</i>

13:13.293 --> 13:17.162
I think I phrased it,
"what happens to the body
during sex?"

13:17.164 --> 13:18.863
Well, people
are sophisticated.

13:18.865 --> 13:19.998
They'll read
between the lines.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.802
<i>And where we</i>
<i>observed, uh, many</i>
<i>physical phenomenon.</i>

13:23.804 --> 13:26.871
<i>An accelerated heart rate</i>
<i>in both men and women.</i>

13:26.873 --> 13:30.241
<i>Respiration also increased,</i>
<i>as did perspiration.</i>

13:30.243 --> 13:33.611
<i>There's a consistent</i>
<i>skin flush in both subjects</i>

13:33.613 --> 13:34.379
<i>Called vasocongestion.</i>

13:34.381 --> 13:36.748
I'm fairly certain I said,
"skin flush in both sexes."

13:36.750 --> 13:40.018
You did,
but the network preferred
the word "subjects."

13:40.020 --> 13:43.054
Uh, we looped it
from another part
of your interview.

13:43.056 --> 13:45.023
Virginia:  <i>And in both men</i>
<i>and women,</i>

13:45.025 --> 13:48.059
<i>There is a marked increase</i>
<i>in blood pressure.</i>

13:48.061 --> 13:49.527
Lester: All the symptoms
of a heart attack.

13:49.529 --> 13:52.096
Yes, but here,
we're talking about sex.

13:52.098 --> 13:52.730
I must've missed that.

13:52.732 --> 13:54.732
Man: (on tv)
<i>the study continues here</i>
<i>in america's heartland,</i>

13:54.734 --> 13:57.735
<i>As masters and johnson</i>
<i>are now poised to break</i>
<i>new ground</i>

13:57.737 --> 14:00.538
<i>In the treatment</i>
<i>of physical dysfunction.</i>

14:00.806 --> 14:02.507
Physical dysfunction.

14:02.509 --> 14:03.641
It could imply...

14:03.643 --> 14:04.442
Gout or amputation.

14:04.444 --> 14:08.012
Because we see
the couple going
into your offices, bill,

14:08.014 --> 14:09.380
We know the context.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.850
The dysfunction is sexual.

14:11.852 --> 14:14.285
Virginia: (on tv)
<i>our goal,</i>
<i>first and foremost,</i>

14:14.287 --> 14:15.920
<i>Is to promote</i>
<i>understanding,</i>

14:15.922 --> 14:19.858
<i>To start a dialogue</i>
<i>about a subject</i>
<i>long considered taboo.</i>

14:19.860 --> 14:21.826
Okay, well,
that's just a rough cut,

14:21.828 --> 14:24.562
But it gives you
the general layout
of the piece.

14:24.564 --> 14:25.864
Now, cbs is very pleased.

14:25.866 --> 14:28.166
No one else
has a story like it.

14:28.168 --> 14:31.336
And I feel it's not
a moment too soon.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.905
I did some more digging
into your, uh,

14:33.907 --> 14:35.607
Dr. Joseph kaufman
at ucla,

14:35.609 --> 14:38.543
And it turns out
he is publishing
his work,

14:38.545 --> 14:41.112
Something called
<i>man and sex.</i>

14:41.114 --> 14:44.449
A book for
general publication?

14:44.451 --> 14:45.750
Publication is
two months away.

14:45.752 --> 14:47.886
Now, we're gonna
be out there first
with this,

14:47.888 --> 14:51.256
And as I've said,
once you've marked
your territory,

14:51.258 --> 14:52.457
The next guy
to come along

14:52.459 --> 14:55.593
Often looks like
yesterday's news.

14:55.595 --> 14:56.928
But not always?

14:56.930 --> 14:57.562
Not to worry.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.198
Once the film airs,
there's gonna be
follow-up press.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.401
There's gonna be
interviews and profiles.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.570
We're in great shape.

15:11.510 --> 15:13.111
Manny: By taking
the focus off st. Louis,

15:13.113 --> 15:14.946
We now have
to re-energize our base.

15:14.948 --> 15:16.648
Like we out of sight
for a few months,

15:16.650 --> 15:19.350
And suddenly
we're out of mind.
Mmm.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.252
Libby: Welcome home.

15:24.657 --> 15:25.356
Glad you came in.

15:25.358 --> 15:28.359
We're, uh,
back to work, obviously.

15:28.361 --> 15:29.560
We can use
an extra pair of hands.

15:29.562 --> 15:30.995
We're, uh, sending
a letter of intent

15:30.997 --> 15:32.530
To everyone
on the housing board.

15:32.532 --> 15:36.367
The envelopes
need to be addressed
and stamped.

15:37.503 --> 15:38.503
I can do that.

15:38.505 --> 15:41.005
Glenn, go and
get mrs. Masters
settled by the mimeo.

15:41.007 --> 15:45.043
Manny, I want you
with me when I call
supervisor drake.

15:47.813 --> 15:49.781
A presentation
of our work

15:49.783 --> 15:51.416
That puts sex
back in the closet.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.418
I'm not saying
that it wasn't sanitized.

15:53.420 --> 15:56.220
It had all the gravitas
of a toothpaste commercial!

15:56.222 --> 15:57.855
(laughs)
it wasn't specific.

15:57.857 --> 16:00.191
But shep's point,
which is well-taken...

16:00.193 --> 16:02.961
I also told shep
to take out
that reference

16:02.963 --> 16:03.661
To sexual dysfunction,

16:03.663 --> 16:06.264
Yet there it was anyway,
against our wishes.
Physical dysfunction.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.999
And we made no promises
in that regard.

16:08.001 --> 16:11.135
Virginia, stop defending
the indefensible.

16:11.137 --> 16:11.602
(sighs)

16:11.604 --> 16:13.671
Uh, we barely
have a handle on
dysfunction ourselves,

16:13.673 --> 16:18.309
Let alone
any statistical success
with actual subjects.

16:18.744 --> 16:20.745
Other than me.

16:21.113 --> 16:21.612
This is...

16:21.614 --> 16:25.917
This is new work
in, uh, a delicate
and fragile state.

16:25.919 --> 16:27.785
The work is or...

16:27.920 --> 16:30.655
Are we talking about
something else?

16:31.156 --> 16:33.992
Uh, look, if we have
found something as...

16:33.994 --> 16:35.994
As radical
as this appears to be...

16:35.996 --> 16:39.297
(stammering)
to fix something as
intractable as impotence,

16:39.299 --> 16:42.433
You first turn the focus
entirely away from sex.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.836
Yeah, and that would
be groundbreaking and...

16:44.838 --> 16:45.603
Yes, it would be.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.506
So it cannot
be jeopardized.

16:50.376 --> 16:51.776
You're right.

16:51.778 --> 16:54.846
We are nowhere
near publishing.

16:54.848 --> 16:58.049
But that doctor
in los angeles, he is.

16:58.051 --> 17:01.352
And if his book
happens to catch
the public's fancy

17:01.354 --> 17:05.623
And we are cut out
of the discussion
entirely...

17:05.625 --> 17:06.791
Bill, I agree with you.

17:06.793 --> 17:09.627
I know that the film
is not ideal,

17:09.629 --> 17:11.462
But being cut out
completely,

17:11.464 --> 17:13.264
That is worse!

17:14.299 --> 17:16.034
The film will air.

17:16.036 --> 17:18.236
Millions of people
will watch,

17:18.238 --> 17:18.803
And they will say,

17:18.805 --> 17:22.874
"yes, masters and johnson,
the sex researchers."

17:22.876 --> 17:23.307
Who knows?

17:23.309 --> 17:25.109
Maybe we'll even
become household names.

17:25.111 --> 17:27.612
And then when we are ready
to present our work

17:27.614 --> 17:29.180
And do it our way,

17:29.182 --> 17:30.515
There will already be
an audience

17:30.517 --> 17:35.353
That is ready and willing
to take us seriously.

17:40.592 --> 17:43.394
Oh. Mr. Spleeb,
please, have a seat.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.597
Oh, no.
That won't be necessary.

17:47.099 --> 17:50.535
I had a chat
with husband george.
Ex-husband.

17:50.537 --> 17:53.204
And thank you so much.

17:54.306 --> 17:55.807
It's not signed.

17:55.809 --> 17:58.709
George wasn't in
the signing mood.

17:58.711 --> 18:01.846
Uh, I'm not sure
I know what you mean.

18:01.848 --> 18:06.984
Well, not only will george
not sign your original
custody agreement,

18:06.986 --> 18:10.188
He has retained
an attorney of his own.

18:13.959 --> 18:15.726
<i>Look, I don't know</i>
<i>what's bothering you,</i>

18:15.728 --> 18:18.696
<i>But don't take</i>
<i>your bedroom problems</i>
<i>out on me.</i>

18:18.698 --> 18:19.931
<i>I have</i>
<i>no bedroom problems.</i>

18:19.933 --> 18:22.667
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>in my bedroom</i>
<i>that bothers me!</i>

18:22.669 --> 18:24.635
<i>Oh, that's too bad.</i>

18:24.637 --> 18:26.304
(audience laughing)

18:26.306 --> 18:29.407
It's not like
we don't all know
how it's gonna end.

18:29.409 --> 18:30.641
Guy falls in love
with girl,

18:30.643 --> 18:31.576
Girl falls in love
with guy,

18:31.578 --> 18:33.111
Complications develop
hilarity ensues,

18:33.113 --> 18:35.313
Love conquers all,
roll credits.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.115
Together: Shh!

18:38.083 --> 18:41.953
Lester: That's two hours
of our lives
we'll never get back.

18:41.955 --> 18:42.720
Barbara: I... I liked it.

18:42.722 --> 18:45.556
I thought it was funny
and very clever.
(chuckles)

18:45.558 --> 18:46.624
Art's not supposed
to be clever.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.326
It's supposed to be true.
True to life.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.695
In real life,
you can't fix
bedroom problems

18:50.697 --> 18:51.796
By calling up
a party line

18:51.798 --> 18:53.631
And redecorating
an apartment.

18:53.633 --> 18:54.165
I know that.

18:54.167 --> 18:57.168
I just...Wanted to forget
real life for an evening,
anyway.

18:57.170 --> 18:59.437
Well, I can't forget,
not even for a second.

18:59.439 --> 19:02.707
That's because
I look at you,
and I think...

19:02.709 --> 19:03.107
(sighs)

19:03.109 --> 19:06.277
I should sweep a girl
as pretty and as sweet...

19:06.279 --> 19:07.979
I should sweep you
off your feet.

19:07.981 --> 19:11.349
Not just stand here
like a...A cripple.

19:11.450 --> 19:13.684
But you know
I'm crippled, too.
No, it's okay.

19:13.686 --> 19:16.087
I... I accept you
no matter what problems...

19:16.089 --> 19:18.856
I... I accept you, too,
lester.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.592
I... If...

19:21.594 --> 19:24.128
If you're saying
that you're upset

19:24.130 --> 19:27.832
Because we can't,
you know, do that...

19:27.834 --> 19:31.536
I am upset
because we can't do that.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.471
Well, then let's do this.

19:35.707 --> 19:36.274
What?

19:36.276 --> 19:38.743
Uh, we...
We can go see movies.

19:38.745 --> 19:43.147
Or... Or we could
play scrabble,
which we both love.

19:43.149 --> 19:44.782
(sighs)

19:44.784 --> 19:46.217
We could go out dancing.

19:46.219 --> 19:48.319
Maybe we could even...

19:49.855 --> 19:50.421
Sleep together.

19:50.423 --> 19:53.057
No, barb,
I'm telling you, we...
I can't...

19:53.059 --> 19:56.994
I know. I...
I mean just...Sleep.

20:00.465 --> 20:01.866
Eisenhower:
<i>When we admitted publicly</i>

20:01.868 --> 20:03.167
<i>That the u-2</i>
<i>belonged to us...</i>

20:03.169 --> 20:06.103
Looks like someone
worked up an appetite.

20:06.105 --> 20:06.804
I missed lunch.

20:06.806 --> 20:09.440
<i>...We were doing something</i>
<i>that in a modern world...</i>

20:09.442 --> 20:10.641
Austin: I swear,
slap a beard on him,

20:10.643 --> 20:11.742
He's a dead ringer
for father time.

20:11.744 --> 20:16.080
Come Friday,
we'll have a president
with a full head of hair.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.381
That's a first
in my lifetime.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.917
When I first saw
a picture of jackie,

20:19.919 --> 20:22.086
I thought,
"now I know what
the american dream is."

20:22.088 --> 20:24.255
And john kennedy...
(chuckles)

20:24.257 --> 20:25.656
You're living it.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.625
I was junior
class president.

20:27.627 --> 20:30.895
Um, best year of my life.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.763
But we also had
a hell of an inauguration.

20:32.765 --> 20:34.465
Flo: Well, the real one's
gonna be buried

20:34.467 --> 20:37.735
Under a foot of snow
apparently.
Mmm.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.370
I'm bringing an extra pair
of earmuffs

20:39.372 --> 20:41.839
In case
the first pair freezes.

20:41.841 --> 20:44.275
You're going
to the inauguration?

20:44.277 --> 20:44.875
That reminds me,

20:44.877 --> 20:47.945
I need you
to man the office
on Friday while I'm out.

20:47.947 --> 20:51.148
You do know
you get a much better view
on television, don't you?

20:51.150 --> 20:52.984
(chuckles)
my family has good seats.

20:52.986 --> 20:56.420
Eisenhower:
<i>...That they are condemning</i>
<i>the United States...</i>

20:56.422 --> 20:59.757
My kid brother's
working for
the new administration.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.092
(chuckling) yeah.

21:01.094 --> 21:04.829
Bobby pulled some strings,
got him a job in justice.

21:04.831 --> 21:05.997
Although,
without my father,

21:05.999 --> 21:08.966
Kennedy never would've
won missouri at all.

21:08.968 --> 21:10.134
It's not cheap
running for president,

21:10.136 --> 21:13.471
And daddy knows exactly
whose hands need greasing.

21:13.473 --> 21:16.207
You don't go from
being an immigrant
pickle peddler

21:16.209 --> 21:17.241
Who can't speak
a lick of english

21:17.243 --> 21:19.410
To owning the biggest
hardware chain
in the midwest

21:19.412 --> 21:23.180
Without learning
something about
retail politics.

21:23.182 --> 21:25.383
Hardware as in...

21:25.385 --> 21:27.084
Packer hardware.

21:27.086 --> 21:29.920
Wait. That...
You're that packer?

21:29.922 --> 21:32.189
If you knew how many
of these fundraising dinners

21:32.191 --> 21:35.126
I've been dragged to...
(sighs)

21:35.128 --> 21:36.560
And this party
tomorrow night.

21:36.562 --> 21:38.095
There... A party here
in st. Louis?

21:38.097 --> 21:42.233
Yeah, a big shindig
for the democratic party
of missouri.

21:42.235 --> 21:45.770
All those governors
and senators
in the same place...

21:45.772 --> 21:46.804
It's enough
to make a shark sleep.

21:46.806 --> 21:50.541
Eisenhower:
<i>...And work for</i>
<i>a different kind of world.</i>

21:51.009 --> 21:52.677
Dr. Masters:
Uh, well, what I'm asking,

21:52.679 --> 21:56.213
I... I suppose,
is, uh, a favor.

21:57.449 --> 22:01.852
A dr. Joseph kaufman,
uh, in urology,

22:01.953 --> 22:03.554
He's publishing a book.

22:03.556 --> 22:06.424
It's called  <i>man and sex.</i>

22:07.426 --> 22:10.261
In a couple months,
apparently.

22:11.496 --> 22:12.563
(scoffs) yes.

22:12.565 --> 22:14.398
Well, you can imagine.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.367
I'd also...

22:17.235 --> 22:19.704
You... You could do that?

22:20.238 --> 22:23.808
(scoffs) well, I...
I would be most grateful.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.443
I would.

22:25.510 --> 22:29.647
Honestly, I...
I wanted to apologize.

22:29.649 --> 22:32.350
For sending a lawyer
to my house.

22:32.684 --> 22:34.719
Yes. That was...

22:34.721 --> 22:38.255
Woman: Your drink.
Thank you.

22:38.257 --> 22:39.290
It was an overreaction.

22:39.292 --> 22:43.160
I... The situation
at work has been,
um, so taxing.

22:43.162 --> 22:45.996
I was...
I was exhausted,
and I, uh...

22:45.998 --> 22:49.400
You overreacted.
Yes.

22:49.402 --> 22:55.106
So, you want to spend
more time with the kids.

22:55.108 --> 22:57.308
So let's talk about
what might make sense.

22:57.310 --> 22:59.043
I think our lawyers
should talk.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.778
I don't have a lawyer.

23:01.747 --> 23:02.546
No, mr. Spleeb is...

23:02.548 --> 23:06.884
He's just somebody
who works in our offices,
that's all.

23:07.052 --> 23:10.921
I don't think
you want to walk
into court unrepresented.

23:10.923 --> 23:14.792
Why would I walk
into court...At all

23:14.794 --> 23:18.229
When we can just
sort this out ourselves?

23:18.231 --> 23:21.265
Well, because audrey
and I have been talking.

23:21.267 --> 23:24.769
And, honest,
I thought one more day
a week would be enough.

23:24.771 --> 23:27.304
But when you
really think about it,

23:27.306 --> 23:30.241
The kids have to know
where home is.

23:32.310 --> 23:34.645
Henry and tessa do know.

23:35.347 --> 23:37.114
It's with me.

23:37.116 --> 23:38.749
Yeah, when you're there.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.885
But how often is that?

23:41.653 --> 23:43.387
I want a judge
in open court

23:43.389 --> 23:45.656
To hear a typical day
for our kids.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.057
I want
an impartial opinion

23:47.059 --> 23:48.025
About what it is
you're doing.

23:48.027 --> 23:50.594
Has someone, uh,
been, uh, telling you

23:50.596 --> 23:54.498
Some ridiculous lie
about my hours?

23:54.500 --> 23:56.033
The kids tell me.

23:56.035 --> 23:57.067
They're not babies anymore.

23:57.069 --> 23:59.403
They know
when you come and go.

23:59.838 --> 24:03.040
I have to think
about what's best
for them now, gin.

24:03.842 --> 24:07.111
And my lawyer
was crystal-clear,

24:07.113 --> 24:08.279
Given the court's bias
against fathers,

24:08.281 --> 24:12.049
If we hope to win
any sort of settlement
in my favor with the kids,

24:12.051 --> 24:15.519
Then we have
to show the court
that you're...

24:16.188 --> 24:17.922
That you're unfit.

24:17.924 --> 24:19.857
Un... I'm not unfit.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.759
Look, if the situation
is gonna change...

24:21.761 --> 24:24.595
I... I'll rearrange
my schedule!

24:24.597 --> 24:26.096
It's not just
the schedule.

24:26.098 --> 24:28.499
It's gonna come up in court.

24:28.501 --> 24:30.234
In front of the judge.

24:30.236 --> 24:33.971
The fact that you watch
people fornicating.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.172
Fornicating?

24:35.174 --> 24:36.440
Fucking.

24:36.442 --> 24:39.643
That you're having
an affair with your boss.

24:39.645 --> 24:40.077
What?

24:40.079 --> 24:41.712
Well, how else
do you explain
that two nights a week,

24:41.714 --> 24:44.415
You don't get home
until midnight
because you're working?

24:44.417 --> 24:46.116
What's anyone supposed
to think hearing that?

24:46.118 --> 24:49.186
Do you even realize
what it is you're saying?

24:49.188 --> 24:50.387
Of course I realize it.

24:50.389 --> 24:51.522
You're saying that

24:51.524 --> 24:52.523
You would take my kids,

24:52.525 --> 24:53.324
That you would
discredit me,

24:53.326 --> 24:54.558
That you would
discredit my work

24:54.560 --> 24:56.327
By dragging this
into public?

24:56.329 --> 24:58.796
Yeah, see?
And there it is.

24:58.798 --> 25:00.865
You're not really worried
about the kids, gin.

25:00.867 --> 25:03.567
It's that study
that you're worried about.

25:05.770 --> 25:07.471
(clears throat)

25:13.612 --> 25:15.379
It's my treat.

25:15.714 --> 25:17.615
(sniffles)

25:25.023 --> 25:27.725
Uh, you can change
in there for, uh, privacy.

25:27.727 --> 25:28.993
And clean towels.

25:28.995 --> 25:31.262
Okay. Thank you.

25:44.709 --> 25:47.411
Oh, the...
The door is still open.

25:47.413 --> 25:49.480
Thanks.

26:13.438 --> 26:15.406
(exhales sharply)

26:16.541 --> 26:18.409
(chuckles)

26:18.411 --> 26:20.644
Okay, so, they, uh...

26:20.646 --> 26:22.146
They're a little big.

26:22.148 --> 26:23.647
(both chuckling)

26:24.950 --> 26:26.884
Um, should we...

26:26.886 --> 26:28.519
Uh, yeah.

26:31.957 --> 26:32.790
I have other pillows.

26:32.792 --> 26:35.993
Oh, no, no, no, no.
These... These are perfect.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.583
Good night, lester.

26:59.784 --> 27:02.052
Good night.

27:11.830 --> 27:14.031
(lock disengages)

27:19.838 --> 27:21.038
I'll be honest.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.907
I'm not used
to having guests
at 2:00 in the morning.

27:23.909 --> 27:25.376
I hope I didn't wake coral.

27:25.378 --> 27:27.544
Robert: No, uh,
coral's still in atlanta.

27:27.546 --> 27:30.381
Yeah, she insisted on going
and insisted on staying.

27:30.383 --> 27:33.417
She's real committed
to the work now.

27:33.952 --> 27:37.421
I'm really proud of her.
It's very impressive.

27:41.526 --> 27:44.361
Uh, I do apologize
for the hour.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.797
You know, don't, really.

27:47.966 --> 27:52.302
In fact, uh, I'm the one
who should be apologizing.

27:53.571 --> 27:54.104
Well, at work...

27:54.106 --> 27:59.343
I know you
need to maintain
a certain professionalism.

27:59.444 --> 28:01.745
I mean, I'm, uh...

28:02.013 --> 28:04.081
Sorry about that night...

28:04.083 --> 28:05.983
At your house.

28:07.352 --> 28:09.620
I'm not sure
what you mean.

28:10.055 --> 28:12.890
I'm not sure
why I let it happen.

28:14.459 --> 28:16.226
"it?"

28:16.361 --> 28:18.128
It wasn't something
that you let...

28:18.130 --> 28:19.463
But it was.

28:19.465 --> 28:20.397
It was, and now...

28:20.399 --> 28:22.666
I need to take
responsibility for that.

28:22.668 --> 28:23.400
It was...

28:23.402 --> 28:25.703
It was reckless,
dangerous,

28:25.705 --> 28:26.870
And a betrayal, even.

28:26.872 --> 28:30.641
Goes against everything
we're working so hard for.

28:31.076 --> 28:32.109
"we're?"

28:32.111 --> 28:32.843
Oh, you mean core.

28:32.845 --> 28:36.246
And if I'm real honest
with myself,

28:36.548 --> 28:39.583
Well, it may even be
why I did it...

28:40.251 --> 28:42.519
The danger of it.

28:42.521 --> 28:45.089
A woman
so outside my world.

28:47.425 --> 28:48.125
Maybe a part of me

28:48.127 --> 28:50.794
Still wants
to throw a brick
through that window.

28:53.031 --> 28:53.964
(scoffs)

28:53.966 --> 28:56.467
I don't really know.

29:04.676 --> 29:06.844
I won't come here again.

29:08.179 --> 29:09.546
I am sorry.

29:09.548 --> 29:11.248
Stop saying that!

29:21.059 --> 29:24.161
What if you did it
because you wanted me?

29:25.530 --> 29:27.798
What if that
was the reason?

30:04.335 --> 30:06.436
Okay, but who's askin'?

30:06.438 --> 30:08.972
Oh, all right, then.
Hold on a moment, please.

30:08.974 --> 30:09.940
(telephone clicks)

30:09.942 --> 30:11.742
Uh, mr. Hugh hefner
is on the line.

30:11.744 --> 30:12.676
Would like a moment
of your time.

30:12.678 --> 30:14.645
Hugh hefner
from  <i>playboy</i> magazine?

30:14.647 --> 30:16.713
Mmm, little ears,
fluffy white tail.

30:16.715 --> 30:17.815
Take a message, please.

30:17.817 --> 30:20.450
Lester, can I see you
a moment?

30:31.462 --> 30:32.830
I'm not interested.

30:32.832 --> 30:33.897
I understand
your hesitancy,

30:33.899 --> 30:37.401
Given that
things didn't go
particularly smoothly.

30:37.403 --> 30:38.268
With the hooker?

30:38.270 --> 30:41.338
This is different.
You have a cure...

30:41.706 --> 30:42.606
For impotence?

30:42.608 --> 30:43.974
I didn't say a cure.

30:43.976 --> 30:48.846
But perhaps
the beginnings
of a protocol.

30:48.848 --> 30:50.280
A treatment.

30:50.282 --> 30:52.349
Well, I have a girlfriend.

30:54.152 --> 30:55.953
A...
Barb.

30:55.955 --> 31:00.891
Barbara sanderson,
one of the other
failed experiments.

31:01.359 --> 31:02.659
So... So you two have...

31:02.661 --> 31:07.231
Have been able to engage
in...Successful sex?

31:07.233 --> 31:08.332
We don't need to.

31:08.334 --> 31:10.100
We've found a new way.

31:10.102 --> 31:11.602
We can be together.

31:11.604 --> 31:13.270
We can be happy...

31:13.272 --> 31:16.139
By removing sex
from the equation entirely.

31:16.141 --> 31:17.341
Well, not as a...

31:17.343 --> 31:18.308
A permanent solution.

31:18.310 --> 31:20.677
(stammering)
that would be
no solution at all.

31:20.679 --> 31:22.446
How do you know?

31:22.448 --> 31:24.381
Because you...

31:25.216 --> 31:27.618
How old are you?
I'm 29.

31:27.886 --> 31:28.485
I'm not a kid.

31:28.487 --> 31:31.788
I understand you don't get
everything you want
in this life.

31:31.790 --> 31:34.458
We're not talking about
a cadillac, lester.

31:34.460 --> 31:36.493
You wouldn't be able
to sustain it.

31:36.495 --> 31:39.029
A romantic relationship
with no romance?

31:39.031 --> 31:41.365
We have plenty of romance.

31:41.367 --> 31:44.268
A relationship
with no sex...

31:45.036 --> 31:49.840
Sex is as basic
as breathing, eating.

31:49.842 --> 31:53.744
Your entire being
will eventually rebel.

31:53.746 --> 31:56.079
Isaac newton invented
a lot of calculus.

31:56.081 --> 31:57.014
He had no sex at all.

31:57.016 --> 31:58.148
Well, he was a virgin
by choice.

31:58.150 --> 32:00.550
And unless
you're coming up
with the next law

32:00.552 --> 32:02.052
Of universal gravitation,

32:02.054 --> 32:04.354
Eventually,
you're going to realize

32:04.356 --> 32:08.158
You do not want
to live without this.

32:08.160 --> 32:12.262
And barbara is gonna come
to the same conclusion.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.764
Trust me.

32:14.032 --> 32:16.266
I've asked you
to trust me before,
I know.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.669
But this time
is different.

32:19.404 --> 32:22.773
I'm asking you
to consider...

32:23.908 --> 32:25.475
A new way.

32:28.846 --> 32:30.714
(sighs)

32:31.916 --> 32:34.618
Are you excited
about the party tonight?

32:34.620 --> 32:36.553
Over the moon.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.055
Listen, I have
a weekly poker game

32:38.057 --> 32:39.690
At the athletic club
at 8:00.

32:39.692 --> 32:41.525
It's always
a lucrative evening.

32:41.527 --> 32:43.794
But I've been thinking
about you going

32:43.796 --> 32:46.263
To this boring
political thing

32:46.265 --> 32:48.231
All by yourself
without a date.

32:48.866 --> 32:53.236
Obviously, we don't have
a conventional relationship,

32:53.238 --> 32:55.339
But I am fond of you.

32:55.540 --> 33:00.811
Well, what I'm saying
is if you need me
to be there tonight...

33:00.813 --> 33:03.413
(stammering)
to be there for you...

33:06.017 --> 33:07.951
Okeydoke.

33:09.354 --> 33:12.889
Are you saying
I should come?
No.

33:13.157 --> 33:16.326
Oh. You already
have a date.
No.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.829
(chuckles)
then I... I...

33:18.831 --> 33:20.797
I don't understand.

33:22.767 --> 33:23.834
My family...

33:23.836 --> 33:26.336
They're not like
other families.

33:26.338 --> 33:27.104
A week before I see them,

33:27.106 --> 33:28.572
I have to read
<i>the new york times</i>
<i>every morning</i>

33:28.574 --> 33:31.575
Cover to cover
like I'm studying
for a test.

33:31.577 --> 33:33.343
I have one brother
who's a lawyer,

33:33.345 --> 33:33.977
One brother who...

33:33.979 --> 33:35.846
Well, he says he works
for the government.

33:35.848 --> 33:36.747
He's probably cia.

33:36.749 --> 33:39.282
The other's now working
for the new administration,

33:39.284 --> 33:41.218
Hence this evening.

33:41.753 --> 33:43.353
Your point being what?

33:43.355 --> 33:46.556
Because if you're implying
that I can't keep up...

33:46.558 --> 33:48.925
You know,
intellectually...

33:48.927 --> 33:52.529
Let me remind you
I went to medical school.

33:53.231 --> 33:54.798
I am also a doctor.

33:54.800 --> 33:57.234
One does tend to lead
to the other.

33:57.236 --> 34:00.003
I am also
very interested
in public affairs.

34:00.005 --> 34:03.140
I've even considered
going into politics myself.

34:03.142 --> 34:04.608
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

34:04.610 --> 34:06.710
I didn't know that
about you.

34:07.545 --> 34:09.012
So, why was nato
really formed,

34:09.014 --> 34:12.983
Aside from being
an attempt to rein in
soviet aggression?

34:15.319 --> 34:15.886
(chuckles)

34:15.888 --> 34:18.255
I mean, who would
ask that at a party?

34:18.257 --> 34:19.890
(chuckles)

34:20.558 --> 34:21.091
(clears throat)

34:21.093 --> 34:22.692
I mean, you cannot be
embarrassed by me.

34:22.694 --> 34:28.098
I mean, that...
That is physically
impossible.

34:28.766 --> 34:31.301
I didn't say embarrassed.

34:33.204 --> 34:35.539
But you are, aren't you?

34:36.574 --> 34:38.475
Well...You...

34:38.543 --> 34:39.676
(sighs)

34:39.678 --> 34:40.911
Let me get this straight.

34:40.913 --> 34:43.947
You run me around
like I'm your personal
inseminator,

34:43.949 --> 34:47.717
But when it
comes to me
meeting your family?

34:47.719 --> 34:50.654
Honey, it's not you.
It's them.

34:50.656 --> 34:52.422
They'll take one look
at you and say,

34:52.424 --> 34:55.992
"wow. He really is blond."

34:55.994 --> 34:58.228
Are you calling me
a dumb blond?

34:58.230 --> 35:01.198
(groans)
austin. Please.

35:02.900 --> 35:04.101
Oh.

35:04.103 --> 35:08.772
Women pay a lot of
money for that color
in a hair salon.

35:14.045 --> 35:15.912
So, of course,
I'm talking to my attorney,

35:15.914 --> 35:18.615
Who's talking
to george's attorney.

35:18.617 --> 35:22.052
But the truth is,
I might have to quit.

35:22.054 --> 35:23.553
Would you really quit?
I...

35:23.555 --> 35:24.554
Have you told bill?
No. No.

35:24.556 --> 35:26.656
I haven't said anything.
I'm trying to figure
this out.

35:26.658 --> 35:30.627
But my only option
may be to quit.

35:31.028 --> 35:34.231
But even if you quit,
won't george still
take you to court?

35:34.233 --> 35:34.865
Yes, he will,

35:34.867 --> 35:39.136
But he won't be able
to hold the work over
my head any longer.

35:39.138 --> 35:39.769
Won't his lawyer?

35:39.771 --> 35:43.106
I mean, won't his lawyer
say you've been doing
this work all these years,

35:43.108 --> 35:44.407
And you've only
now just quit

35:44.409 --> 35:47.677
To make it look better
to a judge?

35:47.679 --> 35:50.881
I don't say that
to be discouraging.
I just...

35:50.883 --> 35:52.782
In case...
I don't know. I...

35:52.784 --> 35:56.052
I have to fight him
somehow. I...

35:56.320 --> 35:56.987
(sighs) I...

35:56.989 --> 35:59.756
I will think of something.
I... (stammers)

35:59.758 --> 36:01.892
I will think of something.

36:05.696 --> 36:08.798
I'm just imagining
if bill did this to me...

36:09.534 --> 36:12.702
Tried to take my kids.
(sighs)

36:12.870 --> 36:16.806
My beautiful,
perfect children,
whom I...

36:16.808 --> 36:19.042
Love and adore
beyond reason.

36:19.044 --> 36:21.111
It's... (sighs)

36:22.480 --> 36:25.482
And yet,
those children...

36:25.950 --> 36:30.854
...When I think that
they may be all
that there is for me,

36:31.923 --> 36:34.057
It's not enough.

36:34.926 --> 36:38.528
(voice breaking)
they cannot be
the only thing...

36:38.530 --> 36:43.333
Just them and only them,
or I will... I will die.

36:43.335 --> 36:43.867
(chuckles)

36:43.869 --> 36:46.269
If not literally,
then at least...

36:46.271 --> 36:47.804
Lib.

36:48.806 --> 36:50.941
Has something happened?

36:55.012 --> 36:55.745
What if...

36:55.747 --> 36:57.747
God, what if you just
let go of everything

36:57.749 --> 37:00.050
That you thought
your life would be?

37:00.052 --> 37:03.920
What if we both did?
Just... What then?

37:03.922 --> 37:05.055
It's my children.

37:05.057 --> 37:06.823
I know they are.
They are.

37:06.825 --> 37:09.693
But what really matters
when you think about
your children?

37:09.695 --> 37:13.630
No, not something
on the cover
of  <i>woman's day,</i>

37:13.632 --> 37:15.465
But but deep down.

37:15.467 --> 37:18.068
(stutters) they're safe.

37:19.103 --> 37:20.937
I don't know.

37:21.839 --> 37:23.240
That they're...
That they're happy

37:23.242 --> 37:27.911
And that they know...
They know that they're loved.

37:29.780 --> 37:31.748
Maybe that's the key

37:32.183 --> 37:36.052
To let go of some ideal.

37:36.787 --> 37:37.954
To live the life
that you have,

37:37.956 --> 37:41.691
Not the life that you
thought you would have.

37:41.693 --> 37:43.660
To finally...

37:44.528 --> 37:47.063
Just accept what is.

38:27.772 --> 38:30.173
I'm gonna be heading out.

38:31.509 --> 38:34.978
Hmm. That was in
the top-secret envelope?

38:35.546 --> 38:36.479
Mmm-hmm.

38:36.481 --> 38:38.481
No address to or from.

38:38.483 --> 38:40.850
The kid that delivered it
wouldn't say who sent him.

38:40.852 --> 38:43.853
So, uh, I figure
it's either a blueprint
for the a-bomb,

38:43.855 --> 38:48.625
Or jackie sent in
a personal invite
to the swearing-in.

38:49.794 --> 38:51.528
(sighs)

38:53.064 --> 38:54.731
(sniffles)

38:54.733 --> 38:56.499
It's, uh...

38:57.368 --> 39:01.671
It's our competition...
The doctor at ucla.

39:02.506 --> 39:04.240
This is his book.

39:04.475 --> 39:06.976
A real page-turner?

39:07.078 --> 39:08.812
It's thin,
conversational.

39:08.814 --> 39:10.847
It's written
for the layman.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.048
Not much science.

39:12.050 --> 39:14.484
No annotating of data,
hardly any data at all.

39:14.486 --> 39:17.020
Hmm, more like
summer reading.

39:17.121 --> 39:19.589
More like our film.

39:19.857 --> 39:21.458
(sighs)

39:22.259 --> 39:22.859
Whereas our work...

39:22.861 --> 39:25.228
Our real work
is miles beyond
dr. Kaufman's.

39:25.230 --> 39:30.800
Our work will leave
dr. Kaufman in the dust.

39:35.573 --> 39:36.539
Look.

39:36.541 --> 39:39.776
I used to poke fun
at your bow tie
in the past, anyway,

39:39.778 --> 39:42.245
But that regular tie
they put you in
for the filming,

39:42.247 --> 39:45.081
That wasn't doing you
any favors, either.

39:45.083 --> 39:48.418
I just mean
it wasn't you.

39:48.420 --> 39:52.589
So I'm, uh, scheduling these
follow-up interviews now.

39:52.591 --> 39:54.491
But may I suggest...

39:54.493 --> 39:57.093
Stick with the bow tie?

39:57.161 --> 40:00.463
I cannot...
Believe I am saying that.

40:01.665 --> 40:04.467
I'll take that
under advisement.

40:10.307 --> 40:12.542
(inhales deeply)

40:16.213 --> 40:18.715
(footsteps approaching)

40:19.016 --> 40:22.385
I need to, uh...
I need to talk to you...

40:22.387 --> 40:28.091
About our film,
uh, about, uh,
this manuscript.

40:28.559 --> 40:31.928
I want to talk
to you about a...

40:32.196 --> 40:34.564
Well, a-a possible...

40:34.566 --> 40:36.132
Virginia?

40:37.735 --> 40:40.003
What are you doing?

40:42.873 --> 40:45.642
Uh, I'm waiting for herb.

40:46.243 --> 40:47.510
Who's herb?

40:47.512 --> 40:48.978
Our tenant.

40:49.547 --> 40:51.414
My attorney.

40:51.416 --> 40:53.950
You hired herb spleeb?

40:54.285 --> 40:55.084
To do what?

40:55.086 --> 40:59.956
Uh, to give my husband
what he wants.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.125
What does he want?

41:02.259 --> 41:03.993
Our kids.

41:04.228 --> 41:10.700
George, he wanted to
put my fitness on trial,

41:10.702 --> 41:11.167
As a mother.

41:11.169 --> 41:14.904
He... He wanted to
make it a matter
of public record

41:14.906 --> 41:18.508
The prurient nature
of our work

41:18.510 --> 41:23.379
And the hours I spend here
and the hours I spend...

41:23.781 --> 41:24.280
With you.

41:24.282 --> 41:27.851
Apparently, his lawyer
had already begun
asking questions

41:27.853 --> 41:29.152
At the park plaza hotel.

41:29.154 --> 41:29.919
George.
Mmm-hmm.

41:29.921 --> 41:31.454
George is doing this.
Mmm.

41:31.456 --> 41:34.991
Meaning we would
have had two debuts...

41:34.993 --> 41:38.461
One on cbs, the two
of us being introduced
to the country

41:38.463 --> 41:40.563
As groundbreaking
researchers,

41:40.565 --> 41:41.531
While at the same time,

41:41.533 --> 41:46.870
A judge in some court
would also be presenting us

41:46.872 --> 41:50.073
To the world as sleazy,

41:50.241 --> 41:51.674
Amoral smut peddlers.

41:51.676 --> 41:55.678
You... You cannot be
put in that position.
Virginia, that's...

41:55.680 --> 41:57.981
That's completely untenable.
So... So what we do...

41:57.983 --> 42:01.217
No, no, no.
It's already done.

42:01.219 --> 42:04.888
Herb is presenting
an offer to george
as we speak.

42:04.890 --> 42:09.058
And the terms
are very favorable
to george.

42:09.060 --> 42:12.262
All he has to do
is keep it out of court.

42:12.264 --> 42:14.531
An offer?
Yes.

42:16.500 --> 42:18.601
You haven't, uh...

42:18.603 --> 42:21.437
You haven't given up
your children,

42:21.439 --> 42:22.572
Have you?

42:22.574 --> 42:25.074
Don't say it like that.

42:26.477 --> 42:29.646
But once the film airs,
I will get them back.

42:29.648 --> 42:30.413
Virginia, you didn't do...

42:30.415 --> 42:32.482
Because I will use
the film to show
that this work...

42:32.484 --> 42:36.319
That my part in our
work is respectable
and legitimate

42:36.321 --> 42:39.422
And one day, very soon,
I will drag him into court

42:39.424 --> 42:42.825
And I can use the sterling
reputation of cbs
to get the kids back.

42:42.827 --> 42:45.728
No, you cann...
No, you have to get
them back now.

42:45.730 --> 42:47.430
No. I can't.

42:47.531 --> 42:49.799
It's already done.

42:52.670 --> 42:55.104
It's only temporary.

43:01.512 --> 43:03.179
Hey, mom.

43:03.647 --> 43:04.047
Mom.

43:04.049 --> 43:07.584
Did you know
george washington
really loved dogs a lot?

43:07.586 --> 43:11.120
And his favorite one
was named sweet lips?

43:11.689 --> 43:13.590
(soft chuckle)

43:13.592 --> 43:14.724
I didn't know that.

43:14.726 --> 43:17.026
Did you know
greece was an island?

43:17.028 --> 43:19.862
Ooh, here's my
question for you.

43:19.864 --> 43:22.498
Um, your dad and I
were talking about
something

43:22.500 --> 43:24.367
That you might
think is fun.

43:24.369 --> 43:25.268
Going to greece?

43:25.270 --> 43:26.836
I want to go
to the potomac.

43:26.838 --> 43:29.105
Not to greece
or the potomac.

43:30.240 --> 43:33.042
But an adventure of sorts.

43:33.911 --> 43:37.747
Do you know how...
How you spend all week here,

43:37.749 --> 43:40.950
Except for wednesdays,
when you're with your dad?

43:40.952 --> 43:42.685
And then on the weekends,

43:42.687 --> 43:45.688
It's every other weekend
with your dad?

43:45.690 --> 43:47.223
And audrey.

43:47.992 --> 43:49.425
And audrey.

43:49.427 --> 43:52.862
Uh, well,
my question is, uh...

43:54.198 --> 43:56.599
Well, you like staying
at your dad's place, right?

43:56.601 --> 43:58.234
Yes.
A lot.

43:58.869 --> 44:00.203
All right, well,
what if...

44:00.205 --> 44:05.808
What if we were
to flip-flop it so...

44:06.143 --> 44:07.143
You spend the week
with him,

44:07.145 --> 44:10.013
And then you're here
on wednesdays with me,

44:10.015 --> 44:14.017
And then I would
take every other
weekend, just...

44:14.019 --> 44:17.353
Just to see how it goes,
see how we like it?

44:17.355 --> 44:18.488
Why?

44:18.490 --> 44:20.456
Uh, because...

44:20.557 --> 44:24.427
Because your dad wants
to spend as much time
with you as I do.

44:24.429 --> 44:25.762
Yeah, he does
say that a lot.

44:25.764 --> 44:29.799
Hmm. Yes, well, you would
be seeing him a lot more.

44:29.801 --> 44:31.567
That's all.

44:32.002 --> 44:35.471
It would be pretty much
the same, just...

44:35.839 --> 44:37.373
Reversed.

44:37.375 --> 44:37.940
Okay.

44:37.942 --> 44:40.910
But all this talking
means we're gonna be late,

44:40.912 --> 44:42.278
And I can't be late today.

44:42.280 --> 44:45.348
Yeah. And you're still
in your bathrobe.

44:51.622 --> 44:54.123
(telephone ringing)

45:00.664 --> 45:03.099
William:  <i>Virginia?</i>

45:05.969 --> 45:06.469
Hello?

45:06.471 --> 45:08.738
Reporter:  <i>...University</i>
<i>of california at los angeles,</i>

45:08.740 --> 45:11.340
<i>Where behind closed doors,</i>
<i>we have discovered</i>

45:11.342 --> 45:13.009
<i>A groundbreaking study</i>
<i>under way.</i>

45:13.011 --> 45:15.344
<i>The surprising details</i>
<i>of which will be revealed</i>

45:15.346 --> 45:18.281
<i>In a controversial,</i>
<i>soon-to-be-published book</i>

45:18.283 --> 45:19.415
<i>Called</i> man and sex.

45:19.417 --> 45:24.821
<i>I realized several years ago</i>
<i>that not only has</i>
<i>male sexuality been ignored</i>

45:24.823 --> 45:25.888
<i>As a serious science,</i>

45:25.890 --> 45:28.491
<i>But the field of sexuality,</i>
<i>in general,</i>

45:28.493 --> 45:30.693
<i>Is also uncharted territory.</i>

45:30.695 --> 45:34.897
I am as furious
about this as
you are, virginia.

45:34.899 --> 45:35.765
Believe me.

45:35.767 --> 45:36.666
I... I don't understand.

45:36.668 --> 45:38.201
Well, it's
painfully simple.

45:38.203 --> 45:41.838
Somebody has
massively fucked up.

45:41.972 --> 45:42.538
It wasn't me.

45:42.540 --> 45:45.808
My team is meticulous
when it comes to
protecting my clients.

45:45.810 --> 45:46.976
And they would have
been the first to hear

45:46.978 --> 45:48.845
About a potential scoop
from a competing network.

45:48.847 --> 45:52.548
All I know is I've heard
the word "sex" three times
in a four-minute story.

45:52.550 --> 45:54.350
Well, maybe you were
indiscreet, lester.

45:54.352 --> 45:55.585
Maybe that's how
this happened.

45:55.587 --> 45:56.986
Me? Hell, no.
You can make an ac...

45:56.988 --> 46:00.056
I assure you
that I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this,

46:00.058 --> 46:01.758
Despite the fact that,
most regrettably,

46:01.760 --> 46:03.893
That's not gonna change
the outcome with cbs.

46:03.895 --> 46:06.496
They thought they had
something newsworthy
with your story,

46:06.498 --> 46:11.667
But now with dr. Kaufman
beating us to the
punch like this...

46:11.669 --> 46:12.935
Cbs already called?

46:12.937 --> 46:14.303
(sighs)
they're not...

46:14.305 --> 46:16.739
Our piece is
not gonna air.

46:16.741 --> 46:20.009
Dr. Kaufman:
<i>...And unnecessary stress.</i>

46:20.011 --> 46:21.544
Bill, no.

46:21.546 --> 46:23.379
It seems dr. Kaufman
has a partner.

46:23.381 --> 46:27.316
Dr. Kaufman:  <i>...Like, how does</i>
<i>a male recognize chemistry</i>
<i>with a potential mate?</i>

46:27.318 --> 46:30.119
<i>What kind of responsibility</i>
<i>does the male bear</i>

46:30.121 --> 46:32.355
<i>With regards</i>
<i>to sexual encounters?</i>

46:32.357 --> 46:34.891
<i>And there's also room</i>
<i>to explore the role of women</i>

46:34.893 --> 46:36.592
<i>With regards to their</i>
<i>interactions with men.</i>

46:36.594 --> 46:39.929
<i>And that includes</i>
<i>sexual attractions.</i>
<i>Do you know the younger one?</i>

46:39.931 --> 46:41.798
William:
He used to work with me.

46:41.800 --> 46:43.699
Virginia also...

46:44.601 --> 46:46.569
Knew him.

47:06.723 --> 47:08.491
Ethan...

47:08.659 --> 47:11.527
How... How can that...
I must have caused this.

47:11.529 --> 47:13.262
Virginia,
you did not cause this.

47:13.264 --> 47:17.333
I let my kids go for that.

47:18.235 --> 47:18.901
Noth... For nothing.

47:18.903 --> 47:20.970
The film wouldn't have
changed anything.

47:20.972 --> 47:21.737
Yes! Yes!
No.

47:21.739 --> 47:23.472
Yes, it would have.
Don't you see?

47:23.474 --> 47:24.440
Yes, it would have.

47:24.442 --> 47:28.277
(crying) my kids...
My kids they're gone.

47:31.849 --> 47:33.649
(crying)

47:38.555 --> 47:39.856
I am...

47:39.858 --> 47:42.258
I am so, so sorry.

47:42.693 --> 47:45.027
(crying continues)

47:45.996 --> 47:47.997
All we can do now

47:48.465 --> 47:49.799
Is get back to work, okay?

47:49.801 --> 47:52.401
So we're gonna...
We're gonna put
our heads down,

47:52.403 --> 47:53.269
And we're gonna work.

47:53.271 --> 47:56.439
We're gonna do our work,
the work that matters.

47:58.208 --> 48:00.743
That's what we're gonna do.

48:00.745 --> 48:03.379
We're gonna get back to work.

48:03.381 --> 48:05.147
(sobbing)

48:20.898 --> 48:22.465
(laughs)

48:25.736 --> 48:27.937
(clattering)

48:37.481 --> 48:38.848
Lester:
Talk about life-changing.

48:38.850 --> 48:41.951
Antonioni is just...
Barbara: Grim.

48:42.619 --> 48:44.320
Strange.

48:44.855 --> 48:46.088
Incomprehensible.

48:46.090 --> 48:48.057
But what a love story.

48:48.059 --> 48:50.159
They... They barely
even liked each other.

48:50.161 --> 48:52.962
Exactly! It's not
one of those
hollywood fairy tales.

48:52.964 --> 48:54.163
It's not
"happily ever after."

48:54.165 --> 48:58.401
It's real and complicated
and very sexy.

48:58.502 --> 48:59.302
You didn't think so?

48:59.304 --> 49:02.772
The way they looked
at each other,
the way he kissed her.

49:02.774 --> 49:05.908
You... You've seen
this film before.

49:05.910 --> 49:06.409
Four times.

49:06.411 --> 49:10.813
So you wanted me
to see something in it.

49:10.815 --> 49:12.181
Yes.

49:12.349 --> 49:15.418
I wanted you to see us...

49:15.420 --> 49:18.654
A real, messy,
complicated couple,

49:18.656 --> 49:22.024
But a couple
that has that.

49:22.359 --> 49:23.893
That?

49:23.961 --> 49:25.528
This.

49:43.180 --> 49:47.016
Will you not give up
on this with me?

49:47.985 --> 49:49.518
Please.

49:53.991 --> 49:56.025
(piano playing)

50:11.575 --> 50:13.342
(chuckles)

50:13.744 --> 50:17.213
Well, the book part
was easy.

50:17.215 --> 50:20.850
I called up that
reprobate that broke
my daughter's heart

50:20.852 --> 50:24.453
And made it very clear
he owed me one.

50:24.688 --> 50:28.257
Getting the book
to a competing network
that, uh...

50:28.259 --> 50:29.558
Took a little more doing.

50:29.560 --> 50:32.161
Well, you're still
a connected man, barton,

50:32.163 --> 50:33.896
Because whatever you did,

50:33.898 --> 50:38.267
Our film is now
officially dead.

50:38.269 --> 50:41.437
I thought you'd look
happier about that, bill.

50:41.439 --> 50:43.572
It was what you wanted,
wasn't it?

50:43.574 --> 50:46.308
I mean, why you called me.

50:47.511 --> 50:49.278
Thank you.

50:50.414 --> 50:51.414
All right, then.

50:51.416 --> 50:53.916
Your work is better than
kaufman's. You know that.

50:53.918 --> 50:57.219
You just aren't ready
to show it to the world yet.

50:57.221 --> 50:59.321
You bet on yourself.

51:02.025 --> 51:03.959
I bet on virginia, too.

51:03.961 --> 51:09.565
What I, uh...
What I didn't realize
when I called you was...

51:10.267 --> 51:11.267
(clears throat)

51:11.269 --> 51:15.704
...Virginia was
in the middle of
a custody dispute.

51:15.706 --> 51:19.108
You did tell virginia
you were killing the film.

51:19.110 --> 51:21.677
I was gonna tell her,
of course.

51:21.679 --> 51:23.879
I was just, uh...

51:23.881 --> 51:27.283
Setting the wheels
in motion,
getting all the...

51:27.285 --> 51:29.919
All the pieces in...
In place.

51:29.921 --> 51:34.490
After you already decided
what you were going to do?

51:35.225 --> 51:38.160
Believe me, if I co...
If I could take it back...

51:38.162 --> 51:40.062
You would.

51:40.864 --> 51:42.998
You sure about that?

51:43.767 --> 51:46.869
That reminds me of
when you wanted your study

51:46.871 --> 51:47.937
At maternity hospital,

51:47.939 --> 51:50.172
And instead of trying
to convince me

51:50.174 --> 51:53.943
That you were right,
you blackmailed me.

51:54.611 --> 51:57.379
I don't... I don't say
that to scold you.

51:57.381 --> 52:00.983
But blazing ahead like this,
always the one-man show,

52:00.985 --> 52:04.553
Always your terms
and your terms only...

52:04.555 --> 52:08.090
Well, it's hell
on the people around you

52:08.092 --> 52:10.259
And no picnic
for you, either,

52:10.261 --> 52:12.661
As far as I could tell.

52:18.635 --> 52:22.171
I know what it's like, bill,

52:23.039 --> 52:25.074
Living scared...

52:25.076 --> 52:27.309
Scared to let people in.

52:27.311 --> 52:28.210
(chuckles)

52:28.212 --> 52:30.012
That's why my life
is simple now.

52:30.014 --> 52:33.916
Being a doctor again,
working at a clinic,

52:34.284 --> 52:36.352
Steady routine.

52:36.354 --> 52:38.220
I'm not saying
everything is fixed.

52:38.222 --> 52:42.958
I mean,
margaret hasn't left me,

52:43.827 --> 52:45.594
Although...

52:45.929 --> 52:49.098
What she does
with her time...

52:50.534 --> 52:53.369
But I took a leap of faith.

52:54.237 --> 52:56.939
Decided to trust.

52:57.741 --> 53:01.043
I told her. Everything.

53:02.979 --> 53:05.314
As tough as it's been,

53:05.316 --> 53:08.684
At least we're
in it together.

53:16.760 --> 53:19.295
I... I never meant...

53:19.462 --> 53:21.764
To hurt virginia.

53:23.500 --> 53:24.934
No.

53:26.469 --> 53:28.504
You never do.

53:44.721 --> 53:47.256
This has got to stop.

53:49.092 --> 53:51.093
You know that.

53:55.899 --> 53:58.400
I don't know anything.

54:01.538 --> 54:03.239
Well, no.

54:03.673 --> 54:06.375
That's not entirely true.

54:08.278 --> 54:10.079
I know...

54:10.081 --> 54:15.217
That my husband has been
having an affair for years.

54:18.054 --> 54:22.558
And I... I used
to just pretend that
it wasn't happening.

54:22.560 --> 54:25.761
And then I looked
the other way.

54:25.763 --> 54:29.131
And then I focused
on my children.

54:29.332 --> 54:31.166
And then...

54:31.935 --> 54:33.836
I met you.

54:35.538 --> 54:37.573
And I know...

54:38.742 --> 54:41.076
I know that this...

54:42.145 --> 54:44.613
Thing that we have...

54:45.749 --> 54:47.016
(sighs)

54:47.018 --> 54:49.518
I know that I want it.

54:53.323 --> 54:56.458
That is something
that I know.

54:58.295 --> 55:00.796
I know I want to feel.

55:08.004 --> 55:10.606
Brinkley:  <i>The motorcade has</i>
<i>just arrived at the capitol</i>

55:10.608 --> 55:12.341
<i>Where the attending</i>
<i>dignitaries</i>

55:12.343 --> 55:15.411
<i>Have assembled</i>
<i>for the inaugural ceremony.</i>

55:15.413 --> 55:20.449
<i>Now taking their seats are</i>
<i>members of the kennedy family.</i>
<i>(telephone ringing)</i>

55:20.451 --> 55:21.950
<i>Mrs. Kennedy</i>
<i>with her mother...</i>

55:21.952 --> 55:25.954
Cal-o-metric,
where the new you is just
three small tablets away.

55:25.956 --> 55:26.789
Hold, please.

55:26.791 --> 55:27.656
(telephone receiver clicks)

55:27.658 --> 55:30.659
Brinkley:  <i>Vice president-elect</i>
<i>lyndon baines johnson,</i>

55:30.661 --> 55:32.461
<i>And the last to</i>
<i>take his place,</i>

55:32.463 --> 55:36.365
<i>President-elect</i>
<i>john fitzgerald kennedy.</i>

55:39.002 --> 55:41.270
Austin: Look at that.

55:41.272 --> 55:43.038
No top hat.

55:45.342 --> 55:45.808
(scoffs)

55:45.810 --> 55:49.778
John f. Kennedy:
<i>President truman,</i>
<i>reverend clergy,</i>

55:49.780 --> 55:51.747
<i>Fellow citizens,</i>

55:52.148 --> 55:54.083
<i>We observe today</i>

55:54.085 --> 55:59.955
<i>Not a victory of party</i>
<i>but a celebration of freedom.</i>

56:02.325 --> 56:05.361
<i>For I have sworn before you</i>

56:05.495 --> 56:07.296
<i>And almighty god</i>

56:07.298 --> 56:12.968
<i>The same solemn oath</i>
<i>our forebears prescribed</i>

56:12.970 --> 56:16.238
<i>Nearly a century</i>
<i>and three-quarters ago,</i>

56:16.240 --> 56:21.176
<i>Symbolizing an end,</i>
<i>as well as a beginning,</i>

56:21.344 --> 56:26.014
<i>Signifying renewal,</i>
<i>as well as change.</i>

56:26.349 --> 56:27.783
<i>For which our forebears fought</i>

56:27.785 --> 56:30.319
<i>Are still at issue</i>
<i>around the globe...</i>

56:30.321 --> 56:32.688
<i>The belief that</i>
<i>the rights of man</i>

56:32.690 --> 56:36.425
<i>Come not from the generosity</i>
<i>of the state,</i>

56:36.427 --> 56:38.761
<i>But from the hand of god.</i>

56:38.763 --> 56:42.698
We know that
we've failed you both...

56:42.700 --> 56:44.366
That you've shared
your struggles with us.

56:44.368 --> 56:47.035
And trusted us
to devise a...
A treatment,

56:47.037 --> 56:50.272
Yet we made little
discernable progress.

56:50.274 --> 56:52.307
And...
And worst of all,

56:52.309 --> 56:55.644
Our approach
discouraged you,

56:56.413 --> 56:57.146
Filled you with despair.

56:57.148 --> 57:01.750
But we don't think
that has to be the
end of the story.

57:01.752 --> 57:02.418
We have developed...

57:02.420 --> 57:05.320
Are in the process
of developing
a protocol...

57:05.322 --> 57:08.056
A path back,
if you will...

57:08.058 --> 57:09.291
Steps that you can follow...

57:09.293 --> 57:12.428
William:
That may lead you back
to a happy life,

57:12.430 --> 57:14.830
A full and satisfying life.

57:14.832 --> 57:19.268
But the key is,
it takes both of you

57:19.669 --> 57:21.770
To make a leap of faith.

57:21.772 --> 57:23.472
Of trust.

57:23.673 --> 57:25.107
Working together.

57:25.109 --> 57:26.875
In it...

57:27.243 --> 57:29.144
Together.

57:29.879 --> 57:32.147
That is the key.

57:40.156 --> 57:42.257
Kennedy:
<i>We dare not forget today</i>

57:42.259 --> 57:46.395
<i>That we are the heirs</i>
<i>of that first revolution.</i>

57:46.397 --> 57:51.467
<i>Let the word go forth</i>
<i>from this time and place</i>

57:51.469 --> 57:54.403
<i>To friend and foe alike,</i>

57:54.604 --> 57:56.939
<i>That the torch has been passed</i>

57:56.941 --> 58:00.576
<i>To a new generation</i>
<i>of americans...</i>

58:00.743 --> 58:03.212
<i>Born in this century...</i>
