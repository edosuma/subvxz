00:14.040 --> 00:19.000
<i>My daughter, Stiorra, and her husband,</i>
<i>Sigtryggr, have an unwelcome guest,</i>

00:19.080 --> 00:21.480
<i>Sigtryggr's treacherous brother,</i>
<i>Rognvaldr…</i>

00:21.560 --> 00:24.400
Why do you agree
when he seeks to come between us?

00:24.480 --> 00:26.480
<i>…who secretly plots against them.</i>

00:31.480 --> 00:34.960
<i>My beloved Aethelflaed</i>
<i>has visited us in Rumcofa.</i>

00:35.800 --> 00:38.040
Some say I came to see you.

00:38.120 --> 00:40.760
I wish that were true,
but I think it is not.

00:40.840 --> 00:44.880
<i>And my liegeman Cynlaef has found</i>
<i>favor with her daughter, Aelfwynn.</i>

00:44.960 --> 00:47.120
Go and help the Lady Aelfwynn
off her horse.

00:48.600 --> 00:51.800
<i>Aethelflaed brought a holy man,</i>
<i>Father Benedict.</i>

00:51.880 --> 00:53.920
Rumcofa does not need a priest.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.080
- He's an exceptionally gifted scholar.
- He's a gambler.

00:58.040 --> 01:00.240
Make sure he gives that back.

01:00.320 --> 01:03.240
<i>Brida has returned</i>
<i>with her daughter, Vibeke,</i>

01:03.320 --> 01:04.880
<i>believed to be a seer.</i>

01:04.960 --> 01:06.320
The seer has chosen.

01:06.400 --> 01:10.600
<i>Her hatred of me and my family</i>
<i>still burns like a poison.</i>

01:10.680 --> 01:13.480
- Who did this to you?
- Brida!

01:13.560 --> 01:16.160
<i>And now she has invaded Eoferwic,</i>

01:16.240 --> 01:19.040
<i>spreading pain and terror</i>
<i>through the city.</i>

01:19.120 --> 01:19.960
Find Stiorra!

01:21.800 --> 01:23.520
<i> Destiny is all!</i>

01:28.440 --> 01:30.720
Find Stiorra! Find Uhtred's daughter!

02:42.960 --> 02:44.680
Leave him, it is done.

03:00.440 --> 03:01.400
Go and play.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.440
She is nothing to fear!

03:11.280 --> 03:15.040
She's here to rescue you,
turn you back to the gods.

03:29.760 --> 03:31.880
Do not fight them, brother.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.040
She has the power. Yield!

03:52.600 --> 03:53.560
Oh!

04:04.520 --> 04:05.800
Jesus, save us.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.400
Yield!

04:18.320 --> 04:20.640
- She will do it again.

04:22.200 --> 04:25.480
Sigtryggr,
for the sake of your people, yield.

04:38.480 --> 04:43.960
King Sigtryggr. How you have thrived.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.160
What is this madness?

04:46.240 --> 04:48.760
It is not madness to honor the gods.

04:48.840 --> 04:55.400
You do not speak for the gods.
Our gods do not need a priestess!

04:56.320 --> 04:58.640
You follow her like Christian sheep?!

05:05.200 --> 05:06.160
Where is his wife?

05:07.760 --> 05:08.960
Let me find her.

05:10.440 --> 05:11.440
Rognvaldr, no.

05:13.560 --> 05:14.800
Rognvaldr, no!

05:15.920 --> 05:16.880
Leave her be!

05:33.080 --> 05:35.360
You little dog, huh?

05:38.280 --> 05:39.840
No longer the man he was.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.800
Christians have a story for it.

05:53.360 --> 05:56.520
Stiorra…!

05:57.480 --> 05:59.080
We're coming for you!

06:02.120 --> 06:03.360
Stiorra!

06:11.640 --> 06:15.240
Stiorra? Stiorra, come out!

06:30.160 --> 06:33.200
Show Brida you're sorry
for letting your people stray.

06:54.440 --> 06:56.120
She will forgive you.

07:17.240 --> 07:18.200
- You!

07:21.040 --> 07:22.200
Where is your mistress?

07:23.800 --> 07:27.720
I have not seen her,
Lord. She has left.

07:38.520 --> 07:43.400
- This way.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.680
- Harder.
- Please, I cannot.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.320
Where is she?

08:15.400 --> 08:18.120
She says she has fled
with her women.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.680
- Is this true?

08:22.760 --> 08:24.480
Come on, you can trust me.

08:25.520 --> 08:27.200
It would be foolish to lie, girl.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.000
Search every home,
bring me hostages.

09:31.080 --> 09:35.120
I want anyone who could be Stiorra
lined up in the square! Bring the water.

09:39.520 --> 09:40.600
Brida!

09:45.640 --> 09:49.920
Allow him to live
and he will come to you as I did. Please.

09:51.280 --> 09:54.240
Let me teach him
how we worship the gods with purity.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.320
All this to prove yourself
to your brother?

09:58.200 --> 10:01.840
- To get the chance to lead him?
- I will not follow this perversion.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.200
I lead these people
and I will die their king.

10:09.320 --> 10:11.120
As you wish. Kill him.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.240
No!

10:17.320 --> 10:18.360
You kill him.

10:23.400 --> 10:24.240
He's my kin.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.400
He has betrayed our gods.

10:28.200 --> 10:31.560
He allowed the Christians
to take root here and poison our brothers.

10:33.480 --> 10:35.800
Kill him, hm?

11:46.000 --> 11:48.840
You have shown me you're loyal. Good.

11:51.000 --> 11:56.080
Now I've shown you all I act with justice,
you will come and welcome me in time.

11:56.720 --> 11:59.320
I set you free, Danes of Jorvik.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.160
Open the gates. Open them!

12:12.400 --> 12:13.240
Find Uhtred.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.520
I will not leave my people to your mercy.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.600
We will find your wife, you know we will.

12:21.680 --> 12:23.400
So I offer you this bargain.

12:24.520 --> 12:28.960
I will spare her life,
only if you bring me Uhtred.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.520
Sigtryggr!

13:35.840 --> 13:38.000
- There you go.
- Thank you.

14:01.720 --> 14:03.200
Do not give up hope.

14:04.320 --> 14:08.040
- Sit with him, your voice might wake him.
- And say what?

14:10.400 --> 14:12.280
What words are there for this?

14:16.280 --> 14:18.520
How can I tell him he is no longer a man?

14:19.880 --> 14:21.400
Tell him he is still your son.

14:28.440 --> 14:30.760
Uh, the scouts are returning
from the hillside.

14:32.320 --> 14:34.080
I will send for you should he wake.

14:46.640 --> 14:49.920
Nothing to the east,
nothing upriver, nothing downriver.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.600
I don't think she's here, Lord.

15:09.240 --> 15:12.560
I have no wish to harm you, huh?

15:13.320 --> 15:15.880
Only make you see
how you have fallen from the path.

15:21.920 --> 15:22.920
On your knees.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.600
On your knees.

15:32.680 --> 15:34.160
On your knees, all of you!

15:35.480 --> 15:40.000
You will stay like that until your Stiorra
saves you from your agony.

15:40.560 --> 15:45.120
Stiorra, show yourself!
Do not let these women suffer!

15:56.360 --> 15:59.040
You must stay here.

16:01.840 --> 16:04.640
- Hey! Don't leave your guard!

16:05.120 --> 16:07.000
You piss and shit where you stand.

16:09.040 --> 16:10.640
I should return to my post.

16:13.720 --> 16:19.640
I'm needed on the bankside.
If Brida attacks, she will torture us all.

16:19.720 --> 16:21.640
I am a woman of royal blood.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.760
It's my duty to be tortured.

16:31.920 --> 16:34.160
Lord, stand down.

16:34.240 --> 16:37.200
- Let me take over the watch.
- No. We must keep all the men ready.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.000
Lord, rest.

16:39.080 --> 16:40.320
We have men everywhere.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.560
- We'll not be taken by surprise.
- I am already outplayed, Finan.

16:45.200 --> 16:47.720
- You couldn't have known.
- I did.

16:49.120 --> 16:50.680
I always knew she would return.

16:52.320 --> 16:54.800
I just thought she would attack me,
not you.

16:57.120 --> 16:57.960
Nor my son.

16:58.040 --> 17:01.200
It is a grievous wound,
but your son can survive it.

17:01.280 --> 17:03.400
Survive perhaps, but live?

17:05.240 --> 17:06.680
Have no child, no legacy.

17:07.280 --> 17:08.320
Uhtred!

17:10.359 --> 17:12.480
I have grave news from across the country.

17:12.560 --> 17:15.160
Stiorra? She has attacked Eoferwic?

17:15.880 --> 17:18.359
- How did you know?
- She's coming for my bloodline.

17:20.359 --> 17:23.200
Stand down the men. We will be leaving.

17:34.520 --> 17:37.080
- How long has it been like this?
- Less than a year.

17:38.280 --> 17:39.320
A year?

17:46.640 --> 17:48.200
- Does this hurt--
- Yes.

17:49.360 --> 17:53.080
- Yes, it does.
- Have you shown this to anyone else?

17:54.600 --> 17:57.160
The healers in Mercia
are not to be trusted.

17:57.720 --> 18:01.000
Any sign the queen sickens
and the ealdormen plot civil war.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.600
I do wish, Lady,
that you had shown someone.

18:08.200 --> 18:13.400
To excise this now might be… May I?

18:13.480 --> 18:16.560
Well, I… I thought
perhaps it might heal itself.

18:16.640 --> 18:18.760
I have had others that have done so.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.280
I fear this will not heal itself.

18:25.840 --> 18:29.360
I know that taking a knife to it
might be dangerous, but I am prepared.

18:31.440 --> 18:35.080
- I am not sure we can remove it.
- Curtail it then, perhaps?

18:38.560 --> 18:41.720
It seems to grow rather rapidly now.

18:43.440 --> 18:45.920
It grows as the flesh falls from my belly.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.480
May I just…?

18:53.840 --> 18:55.200
Is this beyond your skill?

18:56.880 --> 18:58.920
Have I misjudged your reputation?

18:59.920 --> 19:03.000
Lady, I fear it is too late
to save you from this canker.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.200
You have seen this before.

19:08.840 --> 19:09.760
Only on…

19:13.480 --> 19:15.560
Were you going to say "only on the dead"?

19:18.320 --> 19:19.760
Yes, Lady, I was.

19:21.440 --> 19:23.880
My heart breaks, I have no words.

19:26.920 --> 19:31.080
Well, then,
I must attend to urgent matters.

19:32.560 --> 19:34.000
The Mercian succession,

19:35.440 --> 19:37.840
how we maintain peace.

19:37.920 --> 19:41.520
No, I would urge you instead to spend
your time with those that you love.

19:41.600 --> 19:45.000
You are clearly unfamiliar
with the demands of ruling a kingdom.

19:50.240 --> 19:51.240
Do not cry.

19:52.040 --> 19:54.600
There is much to do. I am still myself.

19:59.960 --> 20:02.120
Lady Aethelflaed is sleeping
and should not be disturbed.

20:02.200 --> 20:03.440
She will want to hear this.

20:03.520 --> 20:06.520
No. As Father Benedict says,
she should not be disturbed.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.320
Aldhelm, my daughter is in danger.

20:08.400 --> 20:11.360
She is attending to matters for Mercians
and Mercians alone.

20:12.400 --> 20:16.720
She asks you prepare her mother for mass.
The lady invites you in.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.440
What is the news that cannot wait?

20:24.520 --> 20:27.240
Eoferwic has fallen
and my daughter is in danger.

20:27.320 --> 20:28.760
Then I share your pain, Lord Uhtred.

20:28.840 --> 20:32.360
So we ride out with the men of Rumcofa,
retake the town for Sigtryggr.

20:33.360 --> 20:35.600
- I cannot.
- Why?

20:37.160 --> 20:39.880
- Mercia cannot be distracted.
- Distracted?

20:41.760 --> 20:43.720
The men of Rumcofa will be needed here.

20:44.200 --> 20:46.280
- We cannot take them to Eoferwic.
- Why?

20:46.360 --> 20:50.560
We need to turn our efforts inward,
look to securing Mercia.

20:50.640 --> 20:53.080
But this is madness!
Brida's on your border!

20:53.160 --> 20:55.600
- And if she crosses into our lands--
- Then we will be too late!

20:55.680 --> 20:59.200
- Please do not question me.
- Then do not behave with such foolishness.

20:59.280 --> 21:00.480
I have spoken!

21:04.400 --> 21:09.560
We shall return to Aegelesburg. You may
take a dozen of the men of Rumcofa.

21:10.920 --> 21:12.640
But what of Stiorra?

21:13.640 --> 21:14.720
Aethelflaed…

21:16.400 --> 21:17.600
what of my daughter?

21:18.560 --> 21:20.640
Trust that I have good reason to refuse.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.760
You're like the worst of your father.

21:24.840 --> 21:26.840
- Uhtred--
- And you a coward!

21:26.920 --> 21:29.480
I will do this alone,
even if you give me nothing!

21:31.640 --> 21:33.000
How you've changed.

21:37.280 --> 21:38.360
How you have not.

22:01.040 --> 22:04.680
I'm assuming Lady Eadith
did not have welcome news.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.680
Should I have told him?

22:07.760 --> 22:08.600
No.

22:09.400 --> 22:12.320
He would have been fighting Brida
with a broken heart.

22:16.440 --> 22:18.840
As all our hearts are broken, Lady.

22:21.760 --> 22:25.360
This news is… unbearable.

22:25.440 --> 22:27.320
And yet we shall bear it.

22:29.640 --> 22:30.480
Both of us.

22:33.080 --> 22:36.080
My father faced death
with a soul that was prepared.

22:37.320 --> 22:40.640
He knew his dream would outlive him
and he did not grieve his loss.

22:42.840 --> 22:43.680
And nor shall I.

23:01.160 --> 23:02.760
Raise a dozen men loyal to us.

23:02.840 --> 23:06.680
We will go to the Saxon boroughs
bordering Eoferwic, get their assistance.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.680
She's only given you a dozen?

23:09.880 --> 23:12.800
- To retake a town?
- You did mention Brida, didn't you, Lord?

23:12.880 --> 23:14.960
The boroughs along the border
have fought with us.

23:15.040 --> 23:17.160
They have an interest
in seeing Brida dead.

23:24.080 --> 23:25.840
Are you sure you're ready?

23:29.800 --> 23:30.640
I'm certain.

23:31.560 --> 23:34.400
Stiorra saved my life as a child,
I owe her this.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.160
- Find him a faster horse.
- Lord.

23:41.240 --> 23:44.720
If there is mortal danger,
I ask that you ride away from it.

23:45.320 --> 23:47.080
Do not think of us, just run.

23:47.640 --> 23:48.480
Can you do that?

23:49.760 --> 23:52.440
I'm just as good a fighter
as any of your men.

23:52.520 --> 23:54.400
You're also a greater prize.

23:55.440 --> 24:00.040
- Aethelstan, if you're captured--
- Then I'll say the truth, that I'm no one.

24:02.720 --> 24:03.560
Not yet, no.

24:12.840 --> 24:14.920
How would you like us to respond?

24:15.000 --> 24:17.920
We should signal support.
Sigtryggr has been a strong ally.

24:18.600 --> 24:20.800
That said,
Eoferwic is on my sister's border.

24:21.480 --> 24:26.240
Indeed. She may wish to lead
a counterattack without our interference.

24:26.320 --> 24:28.880
Send 300 north to support her army.

24:28.960 --> 24:31.320
- Make it clear they're under her command.
- Lord.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.880
I have news from Eoferwic, Lord.

24:42.360 --> 24:47.120
Your spies are too slow, Lord Aethelhelm.
I already know and have acted.

24:47.200 --> 24:49.440
Then you are readying your troops
to make haste there?

24:49.520 --> 24:51.000
No, I will not.

24:51.080 --> 24:54.800
They will not reach Eoferwic
before Aethelflaed's men of Rumcofa,

24:54.880 --> 24:56.440
it is wiser we follow her lead.

24:56.960 --> 24:57.800
Is it?

24:59.520 --> 25:01.920
Whilst I am loathe
to spill the blood of Wessex,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.240
does this not offer an opportunity?

25:04.320 --> 25:06.280
How so?

25:07.840 --> 25:10.480
Eoferwic is the gateway to Northumbria.

25:11.520 --> 25:15.840
Take it and three quarters of England
will be under your control.

25:15.920 --> 25:18.800
There are other ways to regain Eoferwic
from the heathens.

25:18.880 --> 25:22.080
With respect,
your missionaries, by now, are dead.

25:22.160 --> 25:25.320
Still, I am a young enough man
to think in years, not months.

25:26.480 --> 25:30.120
If you think I've forsaken Alfred's dream,
you are mistaken.

25:30.200 --> 25:32.200
You are wasting a chance!

25:35.280 --> 25:40.640
Use this moment,
kill Brida and kill Sigtryggr.

25:40.720 --> 25:43.880
I will not kill Sigtryggr,
he has behaved peacefully towards us.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.240
Or appears to.

25:45.800 --> 25:48.920
Are we really to believe
that this is Dane infighting?

25:49.840 --> 25:55.040
Is it not more likely
that he invited Brida to form an alliance?

25:55.120 --> 25:58.960
Our information says different
and I am confident in it.

26:00.800 --> 26:03.400
Not everyone intrigues as you do,
my Lord Aethelhelm.

26:04.200 --> 26:05.040
Very well.

26:06.480 --> 26:08.840
I have done my duty,
I have offered my advice.

26:13.120 --> 26:15.040
The ealdormen will be disappointed.

26:16.120 --> 26:18.080
I'm not certain
you speak for the ealdormen.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.400
He is unwise to keep questioning me.

26:25.480 --> 26:28.120
He feels time slipping
and his standing diminish.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.640
- A war could bring him influence.
- Mm.

26:30.720 --> 26:33.480
Still, go north.
Assess the situation for yourself.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.480
But what of the matters of state?

26:37.600 --> 26:40.200
You may delegate them to the king.

26:44.120 --> 26:48.800
There was nothing in what Aethelhelm said,
that Sigtryggr planned this?

26:48.880 --> 26:49.720
No.

26:50.240 --> 26:54.440
Lord Aethelhelm is simply looking to start
a battle so you come begging him for coin.

26:54.520 --> 26:57.600
He wishes you beholden to him
because you're not.

27:08.240 --> 27:12.840
You are to inform the Saxon boroughs
on Sigtryggr's border

27:12.920 --> 27:15.040
not to give troops to assist him.

27:15.880 --> 27:20.360
He is to be offered no safe harbor,
no support.

27:21.800 --> 27:23.720
That is the word of the king, is it?

27:25.800 --> 27:27.160
If asked, he would deny it.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.920
Thought I was going after
the young bastard.

27:33.200 --> 27:34.040
Yes.

27:35.960 --> 27:40.480
After you have finished playing messenger,
you may return to Rumcofa.

27:57.920 --> 27:59.760
Say what you want, we're leaving.

27:59.840 --> 28:01.800
I thought I should say my farewells.

28:01.880 --> 28:04.280
Why? Because you have sent me to my death?

28:08.160 --> 28:10.960
You risk me. You risk Aethelstan.

28:11.040 --> 28:14.080
You have men
and you have fire in your heart.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.320
You will achieve what you set out to do.

28:18.560 --> 28:21.320
- But if I do not see you again--
- You will see me again.

28:21.840 --> 28:24.360
If I die, I will haunt you
to the end of your days.

28:32.880 --> 28:36.280
- No, no, no. Make your peace.
- Oh, they'll find peace.

28:36.360 --> 28:38.560
They've loved each other
a long time.

28:40.680 --> 28:43.160
No, as soon as this is done,
make him return to find her.

28:43.240 --> 28:45.920
He'll probably sulk
until the summer.

28:47.320 --> 28:48.640
Finan, wait!

28:53.720 --> 28:56.200
I am forbidden from speaking
what I will say next.

28:56.840 --> 28:59.640
Swear you will keep it
until he has rescued his daughter?

29:01.800 --> 29:02.760
Alright.

29:05.680 --> 29:07.600
The lady will not be here next summer.

29:08.640 --> 29:09.480
She is dying.

29:12.760 --> 29:13.600
What?

29:13.680 --> 29:17.360
That is why she could not offer help.
There will be trouble in Mercia.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.560
- But she seemed herself.
- That is taking all her strength.

29:25.320 --> 29:29.840
No, no, no. You cannot tell him.
He must not be distracted from this fight.

29:31.560 --> 29:32.920
I have never lied to him.

29:33.000 --> 29:33.840
I know.

29:36.920 --> 29:40.000
But sadly, it is not a burden
you will have to bear for long.

30:00.920 --> 30:03.240
- Are you ready for this?
- Uh… Uh, yes.

30:05.640 --> 30:07.760
It has been a while
since we went to fight.

30:08.360 --> 30:11.560
Can't wait.
I'm desperate to wield a sword again.

30:24.080 --> 30:26.520
Go, you're getting in my way.

30:28.760 --> 30:29.640
I love you.

30:30.200 --> 30:35.480
And I know it is hard.
But we will return to them.

30:39.160 --> 30:40.000
I swear.

31:09.960 --> 31:11.200
To Eoferwic!

31:27.640 --> 31:28.680
Who is next?

31:31.840 --> 31:33.320
No. No.

31:33.400 --> 31:35.920
I… I cannot hear
another quarrel between you.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.840
Leave Winchester
until you have resolved your dispute.

31:38.920 --> 31:40.120
My King.

31:43.160 --> 31:47.560
- Yes, what is your case?
- I am here to avenge my father's death.

31:49.120 --> 31:51.280
That at least sounds interesting.

31:51.360 --> 31:54.600
A man named Goda killed him
and claimed the lands he gave to me.

31:55.200 --> 31:57.520
- I want them back.
- Yes, I have read this one.

31:57.600 --> 32:01.040
- Lady Eadgifu?
- Yes, Lord King, of Cent.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.800
I have a great fondness for Cent.

32:03.560 --> 32:07.360
I spent many happy times there
as a younger man.

32:07.440 --> 32:08.280
Yes.

32:08.360 --> 32:11.800
Yes, as a boy, I recall,
you were brought to Cantwaraburg.

32:11.880 --> 32:15.280
My father, the ealdorman,
held a feast for yours, the great king.

32:17.200 --> 32:20.960
Yes. Yes, now I think you are familiar.

32:22.240 --> 32:26.040
If I am correct, I was given your horse
to ride and you were not happy.

32:28.480 --> 32:29.320
Indeed.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.360
Yes, as a girl, I cared far more
for horses than for boys.

32:36.720 --> 32:39.960
Well, may I be forgiven for
not remembering, it was a long time ago.

32:40.040 --> 32:45.280
We are all much changed. You have grown
into the true heir of a great kingdom--

32:45.360 --> 32:48.640
Perhaps we could hear
the other side of this dispute.

32:48.720 --> 32:50.240
Where is this Goda?

32:50.320 --> 32:52.560
With respect, it is not in dispute.

32:52.640 --> 32:55.440
The man has stolen property
that is rightfully mine.

32:55.520 --> 32:57.680
It is not in contention,
he is in the wrong.

32:58.400 --> 32:59.240
Yes.

33:02.920 --> 33:03.760
Yes.

33:04.480 --> 33:06.440
Look, having read the details

33:06.520 --> 33:10.040
from Father Pyrlig, I concur
that you have been done an injustice.

33:10.960 --> 33:15.280
Have this Goda brought
before the Ealdorman of Cent.

33:16.080 --> 33:20.040
And this decrees your stolen land
as folkland which I may now return to you.

33:20.720 --> 33:22.400
Thank you.

33:22.480 --> 33:24.800
I am most grateful, my King.

33:24.880 --> 33:26.840
I shall trouble you no longer.

33:31.160 --> 33:32.320
No.

33:33.760 --> 33:35.680
The business is done for this evening.

33:36.760 --> 33:37.800
Lady Eadgifu?

33:42.840 --> 33:43.680
Eat with us.

33:45.120 --> 33:48.400
I… wish to hear news from Cent.

33:49.840 --> 33:53.000
Lord King, I would be honored.

33:59.360 --> 34:03.080
I simply do not understand
what you are trying to tell me.

34:04.240 --> 34:06.200
The delay has not favored me.

34:08.120 --> 34:11.440
- So Eadith's cure is to be harsher?
- No.

34:13.239 --> 34:15.480
It is too late to enact a cure.

34:17.880 --> 34:19.440
Well, that I do not understand.

34:27.040 --> 34:31.199
Explain to me, yourself,
why your cure will fail.

34:35.480 --> 34:36.440
It is simple.

34:38.360 --> 34:39.440
I am dying.

34:41.320 --> 34:43.000
- No, you are not.
- Tell her.

34:44.440 --> 34:46.679
No, do not. I will not listen.

34:47.840 --> 34:51.760
I am not going to take the words
of a prattler who has deceived us!

34:51.840 --> 34:53.400
Mother, that is unfair.

34:54.280 --> 34:55.120
No.

34:55.719 --> 34:57.080
What is unfair

34:57.560 --> 35:01.239
is telling us it could be cured
and then failing to cure it!

35:01.320 --> 35:04.040
- Lady, I never told you that--
- Do not speak to me!

35:05.280 --> 35:06.120
Do not!

35:18.840 --> 35:22.800
Will you console her?
I do not have the strength.

35:22.880 --> 35:23.960
Of course, Lady.

35:25.840 --> 35:27.560
May I ask how long you think?

35:32.760 --> 35:34.960
I believe you will not see the spring.

35:39.760 --> 35:41.840
And I shall endeavor to relieve any pain.

35:49.240 --> 35:50.600
I do not want to be here.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.640
I want to return to Aegelesburg.

35:55.720 --> 35:58.080
Then we must travel
before you grow too weak.

35:59.520 --> 36:01.920
I know not why the Lord wills this.

36:03.720 --> 36:05.400
Yet, speak of it to no one.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.920
I must tell my daughter. Aldhelm.

36:28.040 --> 36:28.880
Mother!

36:52.400 --> 36:55.280
- What is your name?
- Cynlaef, Lady.

36:56.960 --> 36:59.640
- And you are training as a warrior?
- Uh…

37:02.360 --> 37:03.200
Yes, Lady.

37:04.920 --> 37:09.840
Lord Aldhelm, ensure Cynlaef here
is sent upriver to fight the raiders.

37:09.920 --> 37:12.640
And accompany Lady Aelfwynn
in an advance party home.

37:12.720 --> 37:15.840
- No, please, that is not fair!
- Lady, I mean no harm to anyone.

37:15.920 --> 37:19.280
Then I would find some fire
as the raiders can be merciless.

37:24.840 --> 37:26.760
Why would you be so cruel to me?

37:27.760 --> 37:31.240
Why? I try only to live as other girls do.

37:31.320 --> 37:32.960
You are not any other girl.

37:33.040 --> 37:35.720
You are heir to Mercia
and as such must be chaste.

37:35.800 --> 37:38.040
- Why?
- Because that is the way things are!

37:39.280 --> 37:44.960
I have sacrificed everything,
everything to secure our kingdom.

37:45.040 --> 37:47.280
You cannot throw it away
like a cheap ale yard whore!

37:47.360 --> 37:52.000
- Better a whore than a frustrated witch.
- Do not speak to your queen in that way.

37:54.960 --> 37:56.760
Or you will come to regret it.

37:58.760 --> 38:00.600
Now you will return to Aegelesburg

38:00.680 --> 38:02.640
and think about what it means
to rule there.

38:02.720 --> 38:06.240
I have thought about it.
It is a punishment.

38:07.600 --> 38:09.920
Nonetheless,
it is what is planned for you.

38:11.480 --> 38:15.360
I know you are young,
but look beyond yourself.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.560
To be a queen is an honor.

38:18.640 --> 38:20.360
There is no greater destiny.

38:20.440 --> 38:22.160
Destiny is for arselings.

38:22.920 --> 38:24.840
I do not want it!

38:41.680 --> 38:45.000
And that's what happens when a boy
spends too long with his mother.

38:49.200 --> 38:53.000
Do not turn immediately,
but he has arrived with another woman.

38:57.720 --> 38:58.800
She is still here.

39:00.320 --> 39:02.680
Normally they do not last the night.

39:06.400 --> 39:09.400
The women of Cent
are a law unto themselves.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.080
But they tend to be sensible.

39:12.320 --> 39:13.360
I'll deal with it.

39:29.000 --> 39:29.840
How much?

39:31.040 --> 39:32.000
- My Lord?
- Coin.

39:33.560 --> 39:35.440
How much coin do you want?

39:35.520 --> 39:38.320
- Coin, Lord? For what?
- To return to your estate.

39:38.400 --> 39:41.120
Well, I have only just arrived
and the road is long.

39:41.200 --> 39:44.080
Then we will find you
the strongest horses.

39:44.160 --> 39:48.560
What is it that women like you appreciate?
Gold? Silks?

39:48.640 --> 39:51.520
Some spices, remedies?

39:52.840 --> 39:54.040
Name your price.

39:55.440 --> 40:00.120
Thirty pieces of silver.
That is the cost of betrayal, I believe.

40:00.200 --> 40:04.160
- A woman who knows the scripture.
- Mm. Alfred's learning is strong in Cent.

40:04.240 --> 40:07.520
Then you will do the clever thing
and accept my offer.

40:08.800 --> 40:09.720
And if I do not?

40:09.800 --> 40:13.520
I don't know.

40:14.760 --> 40:16.360
They always tend to comply.

40:29.960 --> 40:30.800
You may sit.

40:38.240 --> 40:42.360
Two days. Two days
and still Stiorra makes you suffer.

40:44.280 --> 40:49.240
I am here as a mother,
to see a better future for our children.

40:50.280 --> 40:54.560
Daneland restored for Danes
and Danes alone.

41:00.080 --> 41:03.280
Now, the gods gave us fair winds
and calm seas to carry us here.

41:03.360 --> 41:05.120
For this, they deserve a sacrifice.

41:07.720 --> 41:08.560
Bring her forth.

41:32.920 --> 41:35.240
Vibeke, we're ready.

41:36.840 --> 41:38.000
Show us who is honored.

43:07.880 --> 43:08.720
This cannot be.

43:10.920 --> 43:13.320
I am needed alive to serve the gods!

43:17.840 --> 43:18.920
This cannot be!

43:20.600 --> 43:21.720
Brida?

43:21.800 --> 43:23.600
The gods speak through the seer!

43:23.680 --> 43:25.560
- But five is enough.

43:34.560 --> 43:37.280
- They will be satisfied with this.

43:45.320 --> 43:48.160
Let me go. She will show no mercy.

43:48.240 --> 43:50.680
Your husband will come.

43:50.760 --> 43:53.080
Wait for his command.

44:34.760 --> 44:37.560
Come out! I can feel your eyes on me!

44:38.160 --> 44:39.640
Come out and face me!

44:47.480 --> 44:48.800
We have no fight.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.000
Are you a Dane of Eoferwic?

44:51.480 --> 44:54.480
No. I'm Sigtryggr of Jorvik
and I am king there.

44:55.480 --> 44:57.480
Forgive me. I mean no disrespect.

44:58.120 --> 44:59.240
- I am--
- Father Pyrlig.

45:00.760 --> 45:02.160
Advisor to King Edward.

45:03.880 --> 45:07.000
- Where is Uhtred?
- We expect him with the men from Rumcofa.

45:08.200 --> 45:11.280
I am the vanguard, but the king
is sending his sister reinforcements.

45:11.360 --> 45:14.280
And yet I have heard nothing
and seen less.

45:15.080 --> 45:17.760
The Saxons will fight for you,
you're no longer alone.

45:17.840 --> 45:18.680
Good.

45:20.840 --> 45:24.720
We meet these armies,
take my homestead, kill the bitch.

45:38.960 --> 45:39.920
Right away, sir.

45:43.640 --> 45:44.760
I do not want this.

45:45.280 --> 45:46.840
W… What is it?

45:46.920 --> 45:49.560
Lord Aethelhelm offered me money to leave.

45:50.240 --> 45:53.280
- I did not ask him to do that.
- Then why would he do it?

45:54.280 --> 45:56.120
Lord King, I am not foolish.

45:56.840 --> 46:00.080
I know your favor to me
was merely a passing desire. But I…

46:01.240 --> 46:04.560
I did not expect to be treated
as a common whore.

46:04.640 --> 46:09.320
That decision was Lord Aethelhelm's alone.
He seeks to thwart me on many things.

46:10.480 --> 46:11.680
Then do not suffer him.

46:12.960 --> 46:16.400
He has friends and he is kin.

46:18.840 --> 46:21.040
I am sorry for this offense.

46:23.960 --> 46:28.040
Well, I am sorry for your troubles
as they seem to make you heartsore.

46:30.240 --> 46:33.120
That is the first kindness
I have been shown in quite a while.

46:36.880 --> 46:41.000
Well, my father was an ealdorman
and I knew the care of it was troublesome.

46:41.840 --> 46:44.560
I can only imagine
how much worse it is for you.

46:49.120 --> 46:51.040
Perhaps you need not imagine it.

46:52.560 --> 46:55.440
Perhaps you could stay
and see it for a while.

46:56.920 --> 46:59.640
For yourself, with me.

47:06.680 --> 47:08.080
Yes, I should like that.

47:09.640 --> 47:14.520
For all its strangeness,
I did find our time together enjoyable.

47:18.840 --> 47:20.880
Faster. You piss like an old man.

47:23.160 --> 47:24.800
Die, priest.

47:29.040 --> 47:32.800
Oh, you dribbled
on yourself there, Father?

47:32.880 --> 47:34.600
No, it's holy water.

47:37.040 --> 47:41.800
- Where are the men of Rumcofa?
- Uh, yes, not good news on that.

47:43.840 --> 47:44.960
Sigtryggr!

47:58.760 --> 47:59.840
What news of Stiorra?

47:59.920 --> 48:03.440
She was alive when I left,
but Brida hunts her. There's no time.

48:03.520 --> 48:04.440
We will reach her.

48:04.520 --> 48:05.640
We will save her.

48:05.720 --> 48:07.240
She claims to act for Danes.

48:07.320 --> 48:10.880
- It is you she wants, it is you.
- You have found me.

48:10.960 --> 48:12.560
You have done all you can.

48:12.640 --> 48:17.360
- Where is the army of Rumcofa?
- The lady would not offer them.

48:21.400 --> 48:24.240
- I thought the king sent men.
- He has.

48:24.320 --> 48:25.680
- I do not understand--
- No matter.

48:25.760 --> 48:28.160
I have sent word
to the Saxon boroughs on your border.

48:28.240 --> 48:30.960
Why would the lady refuse?
We have an alliance!

48:31.040 --> 48:34.080
- For years we have had peace!
- I know! It is a betrayal.

48:34.160 --> 48:36.720
- Is this Edward's decision?
- No, it is not.

48:37.600 --> 48:41.160
- What news of the borough men?
- The boroughs say they can offer nothing.

48:41.240 --> 48:43.480
They claim they have no men
stationed there.

48:43.560 --> 48:47.080
Then they lie.
There are more than a hundred there.

48:47.600 --> 48:49.800
I know the Saxon defenses around my lands.

48:49.880 --> 48:52.360
They also say King Edward
has sent an order, Lord.

48:53.080 --> 48:55.960
- No one's to come to King Sigtryggr's aid.
- I know nothing of this.

48:56.040 --> 48:56.960
It is a mistake!

48:57.040 --> 49:00.240
- Then if I have to do this alone, I shall.
- You will not be doing this alone.

49:00.320 --> 49:03.120
Lords, we cannot take Eoferwic
with this number.

49:03.200 --> 49:07.240
- But if we can get in and I kill Brida--
- She'll have men within protecting her.

49:07.320 --> 49:10.600
I have men within
and they will be loyal to me.

49:12.480 --> 49:15.960
You take this band outside the gates,
we can bring townspeople out to you.

49:16.040 --> 49:18.120
We still need to get into Eoferwic, Lord.

49:18.200 --> 49:21.680
My wife will not die
trapped like a rat!

49:21.760 --> 49:25.280
I did not conquer all I have conquered
to let her suffer this!

49:34.440 --> 49:35.560
What are you thinking?

49:37.600 --> 49:39.960
I have a way in. Follow me.

49:40.760 --> 49:41.600
Move.

49:53.240 --> 49:54.200
Welcome.

49:54.680 --> 49:56.280
Take some time to pray.

49:58.040 --> 50:01.880
It is simple,
but in time it will be home.

50:03.240 --> 50:06.720
I like it. It's like we're in the manger.

50:07.960 --> 50:09.760
Why have you come north so soon?

50:10.640 --> 50:12.440
Running a quiet errand for himself.

50:13.480 --> 50:15.920
I have 100…

50:17.680 --> 50:19.880
and this.

50:21.800 --> 50:24.840
I believe you owe him 300.

50:25.400 --> 50:27.800
Yes. The rest will come.

50:29.680 --> 50:31.400
The man has his own debts to pay.

50:32.040 --> 50:38.040
I know this, I will find the money.
Lord Aethelhelm is a good friend of mine

50:38.120 --> 50:40.800
and I am sure he will look on me
with compassion.

50:42.360 --> 50:45.160
Do we speak of the same man?

50:47.480 --> 50:51.400
I can't go back empty-handed,
give me something.

50:52.880 --> 50:54.040
I have nothing to give.

50:58.640 --> 51:05.080
Other than things I have seen,
words I have heard.

51:05.920 --> 51:07.120
And what have you heard?

51:10.880 --> 51:13.560
Lady Aethelflaed is dying
and will not see the spring.

51:22.480 --> 51:24.800
Thor strikes his hammer
when he's displeased.

51:27.840 --> 51:30.400
But he will be appeased
if we make another offering.

51:35.920 --> 51:37.800
No, please! Please, no!

51:37.880 --> 51:39.360
- No!

51:47.000 --> 51:49.480
I cannot hide any longer,
I'm sorry.

51:53.760 --> 51:55.840
We cannot sit and wait to be saved.

52:04.640 --> 52:06.200
Lord, what is he doing?

52:06.720 --> 52:09.960
This is madness,
we should wait until we find more men.

52:10.040 --> 52:11.360
Raise a fyrd at least.

52:11.440 --> 52:13.360
He says there is a Roman way.

52:13.440 --> 52:16.040
- The Romans?

52:16.120 --> 52:18.280
That's our plan?

52:18.360 --> 52:20.640
Have the Romans get us out of this?

52:20.720 --> 52:23.920
Because the last time I checked,
they all died, 600 years ago.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.960
- Osferth, the flint!

52:33.960 --> 52:36.080
It was built to carry turds
from Eoferwic.

52:36.720 --> 52:37.880
Will it take us there?

52:38.560 --> 52:39.480
Perhaps.

52:39.560 --> 52:40.760
Perhaps is enough.

52:48.640 --> 52:50.000
We follow the way of turds.

52:51.880 --> 52:52.880
Wait!

52:52.960 --> 52:56.080
You die before I do
and my daughter will not forgive it.

53:00.200 --> 53:03.080
Uh, Lord, this is a bad idea.

53:03.160 --> 53:06.120
The Romans protected their buildings
with ghosts.

53:34.840 --> 53:36.760
Follow the water and escape.

53:58.560 --> 53:59.960
Brida!

54:03.640 --> 54:05.200
I'm coming for you!

54:05.960 --> 54:07.760
You will pay for this!

54:08.520 --> 54:09.840
Brida!

54:10.400 --> 54:11.640
Then show yourself!
