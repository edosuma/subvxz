WEBVTT

00:04.905 --> 00:07.541
( theme music playing )

01:38.366 --> 01:41.269
( man speaking Chinese )

01:50.110 --> 01:53.147
Man:
INSEAM-- 31.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.482
Iris:
32 AND A HALF.

01:54.582 --> 01:58.452
- YOU DID
IT INCORRECTLY.
- 31.

02:16.337 --> 02:18.439
32 AND A HALF.

02:28.349 --> 02:30.718
( children laughing )

02:45.899 --> 02:47.301
THERE'S BEEN A MISTAKE.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.370
THE WHOLE BACK OF THE SUIT
IS SPLIT OPEN.

02:49.470 --> 02:51.972
Man:
THAT'S HOW WE
DRESS A CORPSE.

02:52.072 --> 02:54.742
IT'S A FUNERAL SUIT.

03:20.934 --> 03:23.304
( yelling )

03:24.305 --> 03:26.940
( panting )

03:46.794 --> 03:50.264
ARE YOU SURE I CAN'T
GET YOU THE MERCUROCHROME?
I WILL ONLY TAKE A MOMENT.

03:50.364 --> 03:51.665
IT'S NOTHING, MA'AM.

03:51.765 --> 03:54.201
I'LL GET IT LOOKED AT
AFTER WE DROP HER OFF.

03:54.302 --> 03:56.670
IS EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT, IRIS?

03:56.770 --> 03:58.205
IS IT NORMAN?

03:58.306 --> 04:00.240
- OUR NEW MAID--
BAD CASE OF NERVES.
- AH.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.710
THIS IS A PLEASANT
SURPRISE.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.745
WILL YOU BE JOINING US
FOR BREAKFAST?

04:04.845 --> 04:07.247
DO I SMELL BACON?

04:38.078 --> 04:41.281
( pigs snorting )

04:43.283 --> 04:45.786
( squeals )

04:47.054 --> 04:49.390
( groans )

04:51.258 --> 04:53.193
( screaming )

04:53.293 --> 04:55.496
( brakes squeal )

04:56.697 --> 04:59.667
( pigs continue snorting )

05:13.046 --> 05:14.948
HEY!

05:43.844 --> 05:45.879
( pig squeals )

05:51.084 --> 05:53.120
( screaming )

05:53.220 --> 05:55.823
- ( man grunts )
- ( thuds )

06:24.852 --> 06:26.987
YOU LIKE PORK?

06:28.656 --> 06:32.059
YOUR HOG'S UTENSIL IS
SHAPED LIKE HIS TAIL,

06:32.159 --> 06:34.795
LIKE A... CORKSCREW.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.396
( chuckles )

06:48.842 --> 06:51.545
( softly )
HENRY SCUDDER.

07:09.663 --> 07:12.099
( ragtime music playing
softly )

07:34.454 --> 07:36.590
HEY, JONESY.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.860
TAKE WHATEVER YOU WANT.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.930
THE GIRL HARDLY
HAD ANYTHING ANYWAY.

07:59.012 --> 08:03.183
EVERYONE I TALKED TO
SAID THEY THOUGHT IT WAS
A LONG TIME COMING.

08:06.887 --> 08:09.456
IT'S A MIRACLE
SHE STAYED AROUND
AS LONG AS SHE DID

08:09.557 --> 08:11.759
AFTER SHE LOST HER MAMA.

08:13.861 --> 08:16.429
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD
BE HAPPY FOR HER.

08:16.530 --> 08:19.232
I AM.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.102
SOME PEOPLE ARE
MEANT FOR THIS LIFE,
AND SOME AIN'T.

08:22.202 --> 08:26.473
LOOK AT YOU.
YOU WERE BORN
IN THE CARNIVAL.

08:26.574 --> 08:31.679
COME ON.
LET'S GO WORK
ON THOSE STEPS.

08:54.702 --> 08:57.537
Management:
LIGHT ME A CIGARETTE.

09:36.476 --> 09:40.848
THE BOY WILL BE
BACK SOON.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.886
THEN WHAT?

09:45.986 --> 09:48.055
LEAVE ME.

09:50.190 --> 09:53.093
GOODBYE, SAMSON.

10:02.736 --> 10:05.338
YOU KNOW
WHERE TO FIND ME.

10:26.426 --> 10:30.397
- IS HE STILL UNDER
THAT THING'S THUMB?
- MMM.

10:30.497 --> 10:33.767
YOU EVER SEEN HIM?
MANAGEMENT?

10:33.867 --> 10:36.704
AND HE'S STILL PLAYING
THAT PUNCH AND JUDY ACT?

10:36.804 --> 10:38.739
ALWAYS BEHIND A CURTAIN,

10:38.839 --> 10:40.908
ALWAYS RUNNING OFF
THE GODDAMN CIRCUIT.

10:41.008 --> 10:43.410
WHAT MAKES ME SICK--
WHEN WE SET UP
IN A BURG LIKE THIS,

10:43.510 --> 10:46.446
WHERE YOU KNOW NOBODY'S
GOT TWO NICKELS
TO RUB TOGETHER.

10:46.546 --> 10:47.848
IT WAS THE SAME
BACK THEN.

10:47.948 --> 10:50.818
WE ALL GO BACK
A LONG WAY.

10:54.054 --> 10:56.623
WHAT WAS IT LIKE
WITH SAMSON?

10:56.724 --> 10:59.326
HE WAS ALWAYS SO PICKY
ABOUT HIS SUITS.

10:59.426 --> 11:03.130
NEVER LET ME TOUCH HIM
WHEN HE WAS SLEEPING,

11:03.230 --> 11:04.765
THAT WAS A RULE.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.400
NEVER KISSED ME
IN FRONT OF PEOPLE.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.270
WE USED TO FUCK
LIKE RABBITS.

11:10.370 --> 11:14.274
WHEN I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA
NOD OFF WITH BERT FLOPPING
AROUND ON TOP OF ME,

11:14.374 --> 11:17.244
I THINK OF HIM SOMETIMES.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.448
NOT EVERYTHING ON HIM
IS SMALL.

11:26.119 --> 11:29.056
Rita Sue:
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT.

11:30.590 --> 11:33.093
AND BACK, STEP,

11:33.193 --> 11:35.162
TURN, AND BACK.

11:35.262 --> 11:37.965
NO! NO, NO.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.968
DO EVERYTHING I DO,
LIKE A MIRROR!

11:43.771 --> 11:45.438
( Stumpy yells )
FUCK!

11:45.538 --> 11:48.809
IT DON'T WORK
IF YOU DON'T DO WHAT I DO.
THEN IT AIN'T A MIRROR, IS IT?

11:48.909 --> 11:50.577
IT AIN'T A MIRROR.
IT'S JUST SHIT!

11:50.677 --> 11:52.345
WELL, IT'S HARD
LOOKING AT YOU

11:52.445 --> 11:54.815
AND IMAGINING
I'M LOOKING
IN A MIRROR, MAMA.

11:54.915 --> 11:58.118
- ( Stumpy shouts )
- WELL, YOU ARE.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.120
STOP!

12:00.220 --> 12:03.190
FELIX, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING BACK THERE?

12:11.664 --> 12:15.235
( Stumpy groaning )

12:15.335 --> 12:19.472
HEY, HOW ABOUT SOME MORE
OF THAT LIQUID SUNSHINE
THERE, DOC?

12:19.572 --> 12:21.674
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

12:21.775 --> 12:24.211
- WHO IS THIS QUACK?
- HE'S NOT A QUACK!

12:24.311 --> 12:27.714
THIS IS THE RENOWNED
TRAVELING WEIMAR ORALIST

12:27.815 --> 12:29.850
DR. DELICHTER,
FROM OESTERREICH.

12:29.950 --> 12:33.887
HE'S GLUING BACK IN THAT CROWN
JONESY POPPED LOOSE WITH THAT
LUCKY PUNCH OF HIS.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.790
GUTEN MORGEN,
FRAU DREIFUSS.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.860
HE SAYS "GUTEN MORGEN."

12:39.960 --> 12:41.962
JONESY KNOCKED LOOSE
MORE THAN A CROWN.

12:42.062 --> 12:44.431
WE BARELY HAVE
A POT TO PISS IN
BECAUSE OF YOU.

12:44.531 --> 12:47.868
AND NOW
YOU'RE WASTING MONEY
ON YOUR GODDAMN TOOTH?

12:47.968 --> 12:50.804
WE'LL WORK SOMETHING OUT.

12:50.904 --> 12:53.306
( sucking )

13:00.213 --> 13:01.381
( exhales )

13:01.481 --> 13:03.817
McNaughton:
AH, DELICIOUS.

13:03.917 --> 13:07.454
MM, YES.
GOOD FOOD, GOOD COMPANY.

13:07.554 --> 13:10.257
BUT SURELY THERE MUST BE
ANOTHER REASON FOR YOUR VISIT

13:10.357 --> 13:12.759
BESIDES THE TEMPTATION
OF MY SISTER'S BACON.

13:12.860 --> 13:15.562
IT'S THE SUPERVISORY,
JUSTIN.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.832
MEMBERS ARE DISTURBED

13:18.932 --> 13:21.634
BY SOME OF THE THEOLOGY
YOU'VE BEEN EXPOUNDING.

13:21.734 --> 13:24.371
NOW I AM
YOUR GREATEST CHAMPION,

13:24.471 --> 13:26.439
BUT EVEN I HAVE FOUND

13:26.539 --> 13:30.477
SOME OF YOUR MORE RECENT
SPEECHES TO BE DIVISIVE,

13:30.577 --> 13:31.678
CONFRONTATIONAL.

13:31.778 --> 13:34.314
CONFRONTATIONAL?

13:37.684 --> 13:39.752
THAT WAS NEVER
MY INTENTION.

13:39.853 --> 13:41.889
JUST TELL ME
WHAT I NEED TO DO

13:41.989 --> 13:45.425
TO MAKE YOU
AND THE SUPERVISORY
MORE AT EASE.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.028
WELL,

13:48.128 --> 13:50.030
WE'D LIKE YOU
TO SUBMIT YOUR...

13:50.130 --> 13:55.035
RADIO SERMONS
TO US FOR APPROVAL
BEFORE BROADCAST.

13:56.236 --> 13:59.339
THAT WAY WE CAN
MAKE SUGGESTIONS.

13:59.439 --> 14:03.110
YOU MAY EVEN BENEFIT
FROM OUR COLLABORATION.

14:11.251 --> 14:15.688
I THINK
THAT'S A SPLENDID IDEA.

14:15.788 --> 14:18.291
SUCH ATTENTION
WOULD BE AN HONOR.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.827
( laughing )

14:20.928 --> 14:22.362
WELL,

14:22.462 --> 14:23.897
THANK YOU AGAIN, IRIS.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.098
THAT WAS DELICIOUS.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.867
YES, THANK YOU.
DELICIOUS.

14:29.903 --> 14:32.305
( chatting )

14:34.874 --> 14:37.277
( Norman wheezing )

14:58.798 --> 15:01.334
- ( Norman thumps )
- IT'S NORMAN!

15:01.434 --> 15:03.136
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

15:03.236 --> 15:06.606
HOW IS NORMAN?
IS THERE ANY
IMPROVEMENT?

15:06.706 --> 15:08.241
SADLY, NO.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.710
IF WE ARE
TO BELIEVE DANTE,

15:10.810 --> 15:12.745
THE NINTH CIRCLE
OF HELL,

15:12.845 --> 15:14.381
BEING FROZEN IN ICE
FOR ETERNITY

15:14.481 --> 15:18.285
IS RESERVED
FOR THOSE WHO BETRAY
THEIR BENEFACTORS.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.287
IF THAT'S THE WORST
THAT HELL HAS TO OFFER,

15:20.387 --> 15:22.889
THEN THERE MUST BE
AS SPECIAL A PLACE
IN HEAVEN

15:22.990 --> 15:25.025
RESERVED FOR YOU
AND YOUR SISTER,

15:25.125 --> 15:27.327
THE WAY YOU'VE
TREATED THAT MAN.

15:27.427 --> 15:31.898
HE SAVED US BOTH.
IT'S THE LEAST WE COULD DO.

15:31.999 --> 15:34.667
I JUST CAN'T S HIM
LIKE THIS.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.870
- I KNOW.
- GIVE HIM MY REGARDS?

15:37.971 --> 15:40.173
OF COURSE.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.809
DOES HE UNDERSTAND
WHEN YOU SPEAK?

15:42.909 --> 15:45.112
I PRAY HE DOES.

15:48.881 --> 15:53.520
- I'LL HAVE TONIGHT'S RADIO
ADDRESS RIGHT SENT OVER.
- GOOD.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.327
( horn honks )

16:05.832 --> 16:07.467
GOODNESS,
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

16:07.567 --> 16:09.102
( scoffs )

16:09.202 --> 16:11.838
IF YOUR SPASMS ARE
GOING TO BE THROWING YOU
OUT OF BED,

16:11.938 --> 16:15.242
WE JUST MIGHT HAVE
TO PUT UP SOME RAILS.

16:15.342 --> 16:20.180
THERE'S A PROVERB IN RUSSIA
THAT OUR MOTHER TAUGHT US.

16:20.280 --> 16:24.584
( speaking in Russian )

16:28.088 --> 16:30.690
( groans )

16:30.790 --> 16:33.793
"IT'S BETTER
TO BE A WOUNDED LION

16:33.893 --> 16:35.562
THAN AN IMPECCABLE FLEA."

16:35.662 --> 16:39.599
( groans )

16:39.699 --> 16:42.602
JUSTIN HAS BEEN UNDER
SO MUCH PRESSURE LATELY.

16:42.702 --> 16:45.172
HE HAS SO MUCH
TO WORRY ABOUT

16:45.272 --> 16:47.974
THAT HE CAN'T REALLY
WORRY ABOUT US ANYMORE.

16:48.075 --> 16:50.277
HIS STRIDE IS SO LONG.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.545
IF WE CAN'T KEEP UP
WITH HIM,

16:52.645 --> 16:55.882
WE'LL LOOK UP ONE DAY,
AND, POOF, HE'LL BE GONE.

16:55.982 --> 17:01.988
NOW I INTEND
TO DO EVERYTHING IT TAKES
NOT TO BE LEFT BEHIND.

17:02.089 --> 17:04.324
I AM NOT A FLEA.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.769
TIME FOR A CHANGE.

17:22.909 --> 17:25.112
( barking )

17:44.264 --> 17:46.166
I'M LOOKING FOR A MAN
NAMED SCUDDER.

17:46.266 --> 17:49.669
HENRY. HANK. HACK.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.238
THAT BASTARD?

17:51.338 --> 17:53.540
IF YOU'RE
A FRIEND OF HIS,
YOU PAY IN ADVANCE.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.775
HE LIVE HERE?

17:55.875 --> 17:57.710
FOR ABOUT A YEAR.

17:57.810 --> 18:02.382
HE SNUCK OUT
ON CHRISTMAS EVE OWING
EIGHT WEEKS' RENT.

18:02.482 --> 18:05.185
LORD. YOU KNOW
WHERE HE WENT TO?

18:05.285 --> 18:08.821
IF HE'S SMART HE'S
A THOUSAND MILES AWAY.

18:08.921 --> 18:12.392
HE WAS A FREAK,
NOTHING BUT A FREAK.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.397
CAN I SEE HIS ROOM?

18:17.497 --> 18:19.932
BEEN RENTED--
TO PAYING TENANTS.

18:20.032 --> 18:22.435
HE DIDN'T LEAVE
ANYTHING BEHIND.

18:25.405 --> 18:29.309
AROUND THE STAIRS
TO THE LEFT.
ROOM TWO.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.445
THE DOOR
IS ALWAYS OPEN.

18:50.597 --> 18:52.765
( growling )

19:07.079 --> 19:09.416
( ragtime music playing )

19:50.757 --> 19:53.560
BUYING OR LOOKING?

19:55.662 --> 19:58.965
YOU EVER HEAR OF A FELLA
NAMED SCUDDER?

19:59.065 --> 20:01.368
NOPE.

20:03.069 --> 20:05.037
WHO ARE YOU?

20:05.137 --> 20:07.474
I'M YOUR MOTHER.

20:07.574 --> 20:10.743
( snickers )
YEAH, I'M YOUR
AUNT CLAUDINE.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.712
( laughing )

20:21.821 --> 20:23.523
( groaning )

20:25.224 --> 20:26.626
HEY.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.929
HEY, IF YOU'RE GONNA PUKE,
YOU TAKE IT OUTSIDE.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.514
( bubbling )

21:23.015 --> 21:25.385
( screaming )

21:29.221 --> 21:31.591
( screaming continues )

21:43.102 --> 21:45.472
( screaming )

21:57.984 --> 21:59.986
I KNOW YOU.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.993
( screams )

22:07.093 --> 22:09.161
GOD DAMN!

22:09.261 --> 22:11.698
YOU GOT TO PAY
FOR THAT.

22:11.798 --> 22:13.866
Clerk:
THIS IS
THE HOTEL ASTORIA.

22:13.966 --> 22:15.868
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU
COULD SEND A CAR TO--

22:15.968 --> 22:19.739
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU CAN'T COME BACK HERE!

22:19.839 --> 22:21.408
THIS ISN'T THE FARM,
YOU LITTLE SHIT.

22:21.508 --> 22:24.377
THAT BEHAVIOR
DOESN'T FLY HERE.
THIS IS DAMASCUS!

22:25.545 --> 22:28.247
OPERATOR,
GET ME THE POLICE.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.450
YES. HELLO?

22:30.550 --> 22:33.720
HENRY SCUDDER?

22:36.188 --> 22:38.491
WHO?

22:48.234 --> 22:50.570
YOU'RE HIM.

22:52.805 --> 22:55.408
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO PAY FOR THAT TOO.

23:02.515 --> 23:04.884
YOU KNOW WHY I'M HERE.

23:04.984 --> 23:06.886
I'M TAKING YOU BACK
TO BELYAKOV.

23:06.986 --> 23:09.556
YOU CAN'T COME BACK HERE!
LEAVE THAT MAN ALONE.

23:09.656 --> 23:11.958
DON'T TOUCH HIM,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

23:13.159 --> 23:15.361
YOU'RE WRONG.

23:15.462 --> 23:17.363
I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU ARE,

23:17.464 --> 23:20.833
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.234
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.

23:22.334 --> 23:24.771
I'M YOUR SON!

23:27.840 --> 23:30.543
- WHERE DID HE GO?
- ARE YOU THE POLICE?

23:30.643 --> 23:32.244
YEAH, I'M THE POLICE.

23:32.344 --> 23:34.213
HE'S BACK THERE.

23:34.313 --> 23:35.582
HE LOCKED THE DOOR.

23:35.682 --> 23:38.718
WELL, WE'LL SEE WHAT
WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT!

23:40.987 --> 23:42.989
( door thuds )

23:52.932 --> 23:55.201
I HAVE A KEY! NO!

23:55.301 --> 23:58.070
( grunts )

23:58.170 --> 24:00.272
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

24:00.372 --> 24:02.875
WH--WHAT ARE YOU--?

24:24.363 --> 24:26.666
( gasping )

24:50.823 --> 24:53.292
Management:
IT IS.

24:53.392 --> 24:56.228
SO IT IS.

24:57.296 --> 25:00.066
( heaving )

25:02.635 --> 25:06.105
JUSTIN,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?!

25:10.442 --> 25:12.912
WHAT A DAY
TO LOSE THE MAID.

25:29.596 --> 25:32.098
I'VE SPENT YEARS...

25:32.198 --> 25:34.701
WONDERING
WHERE YOU WAS,

25:34.801 --> 25:37.536
WHAT YOU WAS LIKE.

25:39.071 --> 25:40.472
HERE YOU ARE,

25:40.573 --> 25:43.042
A SHRIVELED UP
OLD COWARD.

25:44.443 --> 25:47.113
WHY DID YOU LEAVE US?

25:49.481 --> 25:52.551
I HAD NO CHOICE.

25:54.453 --> 25:56.488
BELYAKOV WAS GETTING CLOSE,

25:56.589 --> 26:00.159
LODZ WAS IN TOWN
ASKING QUESTIONS.

26:01.961 --> 26:03.863
SO THEN YOU JUST--
YOU TURN TAIL,

26:03.963 --> 26:05.798
YOU LEAVE US THERE
WITH NOTHING?

26:05.898 --> 26:09.235
THE RUSSIAN WOULDN'T HAVE
HESITATED KILLING YOU

26:09.335 --> 26:11.503
AND YOUR MOTHER
TO GET TO ME.

26:11.604 --> 26:14.073
THAT'S A LOAD OF CRAP.
HE AIN'T THAT WAY.

26:14.173 --> 26:18.244
I DON'T HAVE TO JUSTIFY MYSELF
TO YOU OR ANYBODY ELSE.

26:18.344 --> 26:20.279
I JUST DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.

26:20.379 --> 26:25.685
YOU LEFT ME THERE,
ALONE WITH A GODDAMNED
CRAZY WOMAN!

26:30.623 --> 26:34.026
I NEVER WANTED TO BE
A PART OF THIS MADNESS.

26:36.996 --> 26:40.566
I-- I JUST WANTED PEACE
AND A FAMILY,

26:40.667 --> 26:43.369
BUT YOU CAN'T
JUST UP AND QUIT.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.874
YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY
FROM WHO YOU ARE.

26:49.375 --> 26:53.379
BUT THEN--
YOU KNOW THAT.

26:56.048 --> 26:57.950
YEAH.

26:59.485 --> 27:04.323
I WISH TO HELL
THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO BE PART OF THIS,

27:04.423 --> 27:07.459
THAT I COULD JUST
MAKE IT ALL STOP,

27:07.559 --> 27:09.461
BUT I CAN'T.

27:09.561 --> 27:12.364
NO ONE CAN.

27:16.502 --> 27:19.238
BELYAKOV MEANS
TO KILL ME.

27:22.174 --> 27:25.812
HE'S A BROKEN DOWN,
HALF-DEAD OLD MAN.

27:27.313 --> 27:30.349
UNTIL HIS LAST BREATH,

27:30.449 --> 27:33.052
HE IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

27:35.888 --> 27:38.224
HE AIN'T GONNA HURT YOU,

27:38.324 --> 27:40.126
I PROMISE.

27:40.226 --> 27:42.829
WHAT IF YOU'RE WRONG?

27:43.763 --> 27:47.233
I AIN'T WRONG.

27:47.333 --> 27:52.204
IF YOU'RE WRONG,
WILL YOU PROTECT ME?

27:57.744 --> 28:01.113
YEAH, I WILL.

28:13.826 --> 28:16.128
( knock at door )

28:17.096 --> 28:18.865
COME IN.

28:18.965 --> 28:21.100
I BROUGHT YOU
SOME CHOWDER.

28:22.501 --> 28:24.871
OH, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

28:34.246 --> 28:37.683
SO, UH,
YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING?

28:37.784 --> 28:40.186
ANYTHING AT ALL?

28:41.921 --> 28:45.958
I MUST HAVE
BEEN SLEEPWALKING
IS ALL I CAN THINK.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.927
YEAH.

28:49.829 --> 28:51.130
WHAT DID I SAY TO YOU?

28:51.230 --> 28:55.067
OH-- JUST TALKING
ABOUT THE BOY.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.870
BUT, IT WASN'T SO MUCH
WHAT YOU SAID,

28:57.970 --> 29:02.174
IT WAS YOUR EXPRESSION
OR--

29:03.009 --> 29:04.844
WHAT DO YOU CALL IT?

29:04.944 --> 29:08.580
- THE WAY SOMEONE
HOLDS THEMSELF?
- BEARING?

29:08.680 --> 29:11.784
BEARING.
IT WAS YOUR BEARING.

29:14.821 --> 29:17.924
I MUST HAVE BEEN THE ONE
WHO WAS DREAMING.

29:25.497 --> 29:28.267
SO ARE YOU
FINALLY HAPPY NOW?

29:28.367 --> 29:30.136
ABOUT WHAT?

29:30.236 --> 29:33.739
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT SOFIE WORKING
FOR YOU NO MORE.

29:33.840 --> 29:37.009
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANTED, RIGHT?

29:37.109 --> 29:39.145
WHAT ARE YOU
GETTING AT?

29:39.245 --> 29:41.680
SHE WAS A SWEETHEART,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.916
SHE WAS FAMILY.

29:44.016 --> 29:46.953
SHE WAS OUR FAMILY,
SIMPOLEON.

29:47.053 --> 29:50.322
TELL ME HOW
TO GET HER BACK,
I'LL GO DO IT.

29:50.422 --> 29:52.391
THIS WAS
HER WHOLE WORLD.

29:52.491 --> 29:55.261
WHAT THE HELL'S
SHE GONNA DO OUT THERE?

29:55.361 --> 29:58.898
A GIRL LIKE THAT
IS PURE PREY.

29:58.998 --> 30:01.033
SHE CAN TAKE CARE
OF HERSELF!

30:04.871 --> 30:06.939
I ONLY WANTED
WHAT'S BEST FOR HER.

30:07.039 --> 30:11.010
YEAH, SURE YOU DO.

30:40.973 --> 30:45.211
- GLENN, YOU RUN IT.
- ALL RIGHT, JONESY.

30:45.311 --> 30:47.880
( bawdy music
playing )

31:39.398 --> 31:41.633
Man:
HOW ABOUT SOMETHING, SUGAR?

31:43.902 --> 31:46.572
( wolf whistles, hooting )

31:57.016 --> 31:59.785
Man:
GO AHEAD, TAKE IT OFF!

31:59.885 --> 32:03.055
( applause, cheering )

32:08.594 --> 32:10.462
( sighs )

32:32.118 --> 32:34.620
Man:
DON'T STOP NOW.

32:35.521 --> 32:37.656
( crowd jeering )

32:40.659 --> 32:42.694
HEY, HEY, GENTLEMEN!

32:42.794 --> 32:44.563
WHERE YOU GOING NOW?

32:44.663 --> 32:46.865
THE BEST IS STILL TO COME.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.500
Stumpy:
GENTLEMEN, HERE.

32:48.600 --> 32:53.105
PLEASE.
IT'S LIKE WATCHING
NATURE UNFOLD.

32:57.676 --> 32:59.345
( hooting, clapping )

32:59.445 --> 33:02.848
Stumpy:
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S IT, GENTLEMEN.

33:02.948 --> 33:04.816
YEAH.

33:04.916 --> 33:06.518
THERE SHE IS.

33:06.618 --> 33:09.288
( cheering )

33:25.604 --> 33:28.006
( feigning laughter )

33:36.282 --> 33:38.684
( crowd murmuring )

34:14.420 --> 34:17.589
GOOD EVENING,
BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.665
In the garden
of Gethsemane

34:26.765 --> 34:30.969
the Lord struggled
with His own doubts

34:31.069 --> 34:33.205
about His destiny.

34:33.305 --> 34:36.308
McNaughton:
I APPROVED IT
THIS AFTERNOON

34:36.408 --> 34:38.944
AFTER I CALLED JUSTIN
WITH SOME CHANGES.

34:39.044 --> 34:40.946
IN THE FUTURE
WE'LL BE RECEIVING THE TEXT

34:41.046 --> 34:42.948
A WEEK IN ADVANCE
OF AIR-TIME

34:43.048 --> 34:45.151
SO THAT WE CAN ALL
MAKE REVISIONS.

34:45.251 --> 34:47.653
...But He wasn't alone.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.857
LIKEWISE, WE ARE
NEVER ALONE...

34:54.126 --> 34:56.695
( softly )
IN THE GARDEN.

34:59.231 --> 35:01.467
( groans )

35:15.681 --> 35:19.285
That was the sound
of the sermon

35:19.385 --> 35:22.221
other men
would have me deliver.

35:22.321 --> 35:24.556
Brothers and sisters,
I realize now

35:24.656 --> 35:29.261
that you are not here
to listen to the words
of other men.

35:29.361 --> 35:32.264
You are here for me

35:32.364 --> 35:36.134
so that I am not alone
in the garden.

35:36.235 --> 35:37.869
( audience agreeing )

35:37.969 --> 35:42.874
- ( paper tears )
- THIS-- THIS IS
THE SOUND OF OUTRAGE.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.244
OUTRAGE AT DELUDED MEN

35:45.344 --> 35:49.415
WHO WOULD PRESUME
WITH ALL THE ARROGANCE
OF THE PAPACY

35:49.515 --> 35:52.318
TO TELL YOU,
TO DICTATE TO YOU

35:52.418 --> 35:55.887
HOW YOU SHOULD WORSHIP,
WHAT YOU SHOULD THINK!

35:55.987 --> 35:58.724
( jeering )

36:00.292 --> 36:01.893
BUT HAVE PITY
ON THESE MEN,

36:01.993 --> 36:05.431
BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ALWAYS
WHAT THEY HAVE BECOME.

36:05.531 --> 36:07.666
BEFORE THESE
MODERN DAY PHARISEES

36:07.766 --> 36:13.472
BECAME THE FAT FILTHY PAWNS
OF A GODLESS MERCHANT REGIME,

36:13.572 --> 36:18.477
THEY WERE ALL
RIGHTEOUS AND HOLY MEN.

36:18.577 --> 36:22.948
But what is the devil himself
if not a fallen angel?

36:23.048 --> 36:25.617
( crowd jeering )

36:25.717 --> 36:29.521
THIS IS THE SOUND
OF INDIGNATION

36:29.621 --> 36:32.358
AT MEN WHO WOULD
BETRAY YOU,

36:32.458 --> 36:34.626
MEN PLOTTING AGAINST YOU,

36:34.726 --> 36:39.231
MEN TRYING TO TEAR DOWN
WHAT WE ARE BUILDING HERE,

36:39.331 --> 36:42.501
TURNING THEIR BACKS
AS THE ROMAN CENTURIONS

36:42.601 --> 36:44.770
FORCED THEIR WAY
INTO OUR GARDEN--

36:44.870 --> 36:48.540
DEAF TO THE CLATTER OF THEIR
SPEARS AND THEIR SWORDS.

36:48.640 --> 36:52.143
BUT I AM NOT ALONE
IN THE GARDEN!

36:52.244 --> 36:54.880
WHEN JESUS HAD 12
AT HIS SIDE,

36:54.980 --> 36:58.116
I WILL HAVE 12,000!

36:58.216 --> 37:00.319
( cheering )

37:02.688 --> 37:04.256
SHIT!

37:04.356 --> 37:06.792
AND THEY WILL KNOW THAT
WHEN THEY COME--

37:06.892 --> 37:08.660
AND THEY WILL COME!

37:08.760 --> 37:11.730
THEY WILL COME,
BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

37:11.830 --> 37:14.300
THEY WILL COME.

37:16.935 --> 37:21.673
IN THIS GARDEN...

37:21.773 --> 37:28.314
YOU WILL NEVER HEAR
THE WORDS OF OTHER MEN.

37:28.414 --> 37:33.352
YOU WILL ONLY HEAR
THE WORDS OF ONE MAN.

37:33.452 --> 37:37.623
ONE MAN INSPIRING YOU
TO LIVE!

37:37.723 --> 37:43.829
AND THAT IS THE SOUND
THAT THEY WILL FEAR!

37:43.929 --> 37:46.332
( cheering )

38:02.981 --> 38:06.284
( moaning )

38:34.380 --> 38:36.582
- WAIT.
- WHAT?

38:42.320 --> 38:44.790
- PUT IT BACK THERE.
- WHAT?

38:44.890 --> 38:47.092
PUT IT BACK THERE.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.195
ARE YOU--

38:50.295 --> 38:52.197
ARE YOU GONNA LIKE THAT?

38:52.297 --> 38:53.965
I'VE NEVER TRIED.

38:54.065 --> 38:58.003
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU GOING
WHERE THE JOHNNIES GO.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.773
I WANT IT TO BE SPECIAL.

39:14.453 --> 39:16.321
- Osgood:
YOU SEEN SAMSON?
- NOPE.

39:16.422 --> 39:21.026
- HE TOLD ME TO GET HIM
WHEN THE KID CAME BACK.
- MIGHT BE DOWN THERE.

39:25.564 --> 39:27.599
( stammering )
I GOT TO GO--

39:27.699 --> 39:31.737
NO, YOU DON'T.
YOU'RE STILL TIGHT.

39:31.837 --> 39:36.442
YOU WERE NEVER
THIS WOUND UP WHEN
WE WERE TOGETHER.

39:36.542 --> 39:39.277
- WHAT ABOUT BERT?
- MM, SLEEPING.

39:39.377 --> 39:42.881
NOTHING GETS HIM UP.

39:42.981 --> 39:45.383
- NOTHING?
- HMM.

40:01.667 --> 40:05.070
YOU CAN'T JUST STAND HERE.
COME ON.

40:09.975 --> 40:12.744
I'M GLAD WE HAD
THESE HOURS, SON.

40:12.844 --> 40:17.949
I KNOW IT DOESN'T MAKE UP
FOR ANYTHING, BUT...

40:18.049 --> 40:20.686
THERE'S PLENTY MORE TIME
WE'RE GONNA HAVE.

40:20.786 --> 40:23.889
HE'S JUST GONNA
TALK TO YOU,

40:23.989 --> 40:26.124
THAT'S ALL.

40:30.562 --> 40:32.831
( sighs )

40:51.149 --> 40:52.551
( door closes )

40:52.651 --> 40:56.021
Management:
COME TO ME.

41:04.162 --> 41:06.131
BELYAKOV.

41:06.231 --> 41:08.500
Management:
SCUDDER.

41:08.600 --> 41:11.937
HERE WE ARE.

41:12.037 --> 41:15.373
Scudder:
I'M NOT A PART OF THIS.
I NEVER WAS.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.509
I TOOK MYSELF OUT
A LONG TIME AGO.

41:17.609 --> 41:20.411
I JUST WANT TO LIVE
MY LIFE IN PEACE.

41:20.512 --> 41:22.347
WHY COULDN'T YOU
STOP TOO?

41:22.447 --> 41:26.451
YOU KNOW WHAT
WE NEED TO KNOW.

41:26.552 --> 41:30.321
GIVE US THE NAME
OF BEN'S ENEMY.

41:30.421 --> 41:33.391
- NO.
- GIVE IT TO ME!

41:33.491 --> 41:35.661
- ( groaning )
- Ben: WHAT'S GOING ON?

41:35.761 --> 41:38.530
- OPEN YOUR MIND, SCUDDER.
- Ben: STOP IT!

41:38.630 --> 41:42.033
OPEN YOUR MIND
OR I'LL TEAR IT APART.

41:42.133 --> 41:45.503
- STOP IT, GOD DAMN IT!
- AH-- ALEXSEI!

41:47.005 --> 41:49.541
( panting )

41:52.844 --> 41:54.412
ALEXSEI.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.882
ALEXSEI BELYAKOV.

41:56.982 --> 41:58.884
YOUR SON.

41:58.984 --> 42:00.886
YOU LIE.

42:00.986 --> 42:02.520
MY SON IS DEAD.

42:02.621 --> 42:04.823
HE DIED IN A TRAIN
DERAILMENT.

42:04.923 --> 42:07.525
NO. HE'S THE BOY'S
OPPOSITE.

42:07.626 --> 42:09.460
HE HAS A MAN
LOOKING FOR ME,

42:09.561 --> 42:12.898
AND HE'S NOT DEAD.

42:13.999 --> 42:15.967
( screaming )

42:19.905 --> 42:22.173
- NO!
- Ben: LET HIM GO!

42:22.273 --> 42:25.811
- HELP ME!
- LET HIM GO!

42:32.450 --> 42:34.720
STOP, GOD DAMN IT!

42:36.421 --> 42:38.757
- ( grunting )
- STOP!

42:38.857 --> 42:41.960
- SON!
- YOU'RE KILLING HIM.

42:59.010 --> 43:02.080
( gears grinding
to a stop )

43:07.853 --> 43:10.622
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

43:12.724 --> 43:15.526
HE DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO INTERFERE.

43:15.627 --> 43:18.096
HE WANTED
TO PROTECT YOU.

43:18.730 --> 43:22.100
HE? WHO'S HE?

43:23.669 --> 43:26.304
IT'S MANAGEMENT!

43:26.404 --> 43:29.040
IT'S MANAGEMENT,
ISN'T IT?!

43:31.877 --> 43:35.613
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
( grunts )

44:13.919 --> 44:17.155
( people exclaiming )

44:28.834 --> 44:31.837
( instrumental music playing )
