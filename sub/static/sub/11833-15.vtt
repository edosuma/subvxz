WEBVTT

00:01.201 --> 00:02.503
Previously on The Practice:

00:02.536 --> 00:05.639
Did you murder her because
she was gonna break off
a sexual affair?

00:05.672 --> 00:09.209
I did not have
an affair with her,
and I did not kill her!

00:09.242 --> 00:11.211
You're going down
for murder now! You get that?

00:11.244 --> 00:12.245
It was Steven.

00:12.278 --> 00:13.747
JIMMY: Your son Steven?

00:13.780 --> 00:16.315
HENRY: I saw the door close
on him when he left.

00:16.349 --> 00:18.084
Why haven't you
told anybody this?

00:18.118 --> 00:20.086
Because I don't want him
to spend the rest of his life

00:20.120 --> 00:21.555
in jail for something
I drove him to.

00:21.588 --> 00:24.157
Let me go to the DA.
Absolutely not.

00:24.190 --> 00:27.427
This is between you and me.
You gave me your word.

00:27.460 --> 00:29.162
FOREMAN: We find
the defendant guilty.

00:29.195 --> 00:31.665
(crowd gasps)

00:31.698 --> 00:35.636
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.

00:35.669 --> 00:38.539
Your dad saw you
going out the door.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.206
The reason he's staying quiet,

00:40.240 --> 00:42.308
he doesn't want to see you
go to prison.

00:42.342 --> 00:44.210
He loves you
too much for that.

00:44.244 --> 00:46.780
Jimmy, what happened?

00:46.813 --> 00:49.650
Steven Olson.

00:49.683 --> 00:52.252
He just hung himself
in the garage.

00:52.285 --> 00:55.088
You think I'm going
to ask a judge to release
a convicted murderer

00:55.121 --> 00:57.490
on the grounds
that his defense attorney
says he's innocent?

00:57.524 --> 00:59.660
I expect you to
because he is innocent!

00:59.693 --> 01:01.762
For all I know, the kid
hung himself because
his father's a killer.

01:01.795 --> 01:04.230
That isn't the case!
Well, give me evidence!

01:05.799 --> 01:07.400
(sighs)

01:21.247 --> 01:22.516
(lock buzzing)

01:38.364 --> 01:39.566
Henry.

01:48.441 --> 01:49.643
Hey.

01:49.676 --> 01:51.277
Hey.

01:53.547 --> 01:54.615
What happened?

01:54.648 --> 01:56.883
They tried to rape me.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.788
Inmates?

02:03.557 --> 02:04.725
Two of them.

02:06.459 --> 02:08.762
I covered my ass,

02:08.794 --> 02:11.932
but my face
didn't fare so well.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.668
Doctors say you're
gonna be okay.

02:14.701 --> 02:17.270
I want solitary, Jimmy.

02:17.303 --> 02:20.373
I don't want to be
in the general
population anymore.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.678
Can you get me solitary, Jimmy?

02:25.879 --> 02:27.447
Forever?

02:28.348 --> 02:29.950
You got a life sentence.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.718
I don't care.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.453
Please.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.288
You gotta get me solitary.

02:36.289 --> 02:37.591
Get me solitary.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.198
(music playing)

03:32.979 --> 03:36.449
Richard, I want to reopen
the Henry Olson case.

03:36.482 --> 03:38.785
On what grounds?
On the grounds
he's innocent.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.987
Jimmy, I told you,
bring me new evidence,

03:41.021 --> 03:43.423
and I can--
There's no new evidence,

03:43.456 --> 03:44.891
but that doesn't change
the truth.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.660
The guy didn't do it.

03:46.693 --> 03:48.829
Look, I got a pre-trial.
Can we talk later?

03:48.862 --> 03:51.431
I-- Yeah.

03:51.464 --> 03:53.266
Listen, if the DA
goes forward--

03:53.299 --> 03:54.535
That's not gonna happen.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.436
Why, because your
conviction rate--

03:56.469 --> 03:57.904
Because I don't believe
he's innocent.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.606
The case went to verdict.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.575
The right man
is serving time.

04:01.608 --> 04:03.343
I need a favor here.

04:03.376 --> 04:05.746
I'm sorry. No.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.950
I filed a petition
to reopen.

04:09.983 --> 04:12.352
WOMAN: ...Clyde Miller,
murder in the first degree.

04:12.385 --> 04:14.555
Hold on.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.456
Richard Bay for
the Commonwealth, Your Honor.

04:16.488 --> 04:18.358
We oppose bail
of any kind.

04:18.391 --> 04:20.326
The suspect is obviously
a flight risk,

04:20.360 --> 04:21.827
not to mention--
Is he represented?

04:21.862 --> 04:24.497
Indigent. We're waiting for
somebody from the PD's office.

04:27.400 --> 04:30.871
Mr. Berluti...
come meet your new client.

04:30.904 --> 04:33.507
I'm not taking
appointments today, judge.

04:33.540 --> 04:34.908
Oh, I'm afraid you are.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.777
We'll enter a "not guilty"
for right now.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.712
Meet with Mr. Miller,
then we'll conference.

04:38.745 --> 04:39.980
Your Honor, I can't take--

04:40.013 --> 04:41.882
Are you in trial,
Mr. Berluti?

04:41.915 --> 04:43.449
No, but--

04:43.483 --> 04:45.752
Then meet with Mr. Miller.
Next case, please.

04:45.786 --> 04:49.623
WOMAN: People vs Megan Boucher,
solicitation and loitering.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.066
Can I get you
some more coffee?

05:00.100 --> 05:01.735
This is my third cup.

05:01.768 --> 05:03.870
Is Mr. Bradford
not available?

05:03.904 --> 05:05.906
He's just finishing up
a conference call.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.407
He'll be right--

05:07.440 --> 05:09.610
He's been finishing
that call for some time.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.678
We have other business
scheduled for today,

05:11.712 --> 05:13.814
and if he's too busy--
I apologize.

05:13.847 --> 05:17.584
Thank you, Sheila.
I'm sorry, Eugene, Rebecca.

05:17.618 --> 05:21.955
I've actually been conferencing
with the insurance company
and Dr. Stiles.

05:21.988 --> 05:25.792
I pushed them up to 32,
but that's as far
as they'll go.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.929
Dr. Stiles is angry
to be settling at all.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.797
Thirty-two?

05:30.831 --> 05:32.065
Yes.

05:33.066 --> 05:34.801
Thirty-two thousand?

05:34.835 --> 05:36.102
Yes.

05:36.136 --> 05:39.906
A man is dead,
you're offering $32,000.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.908
Well, it's not a question
of the worth

05:41.942 --> 05:43.777
of the deceased, Eugene.
You know that.

05:43.810 --> 05:45.411
The issue
is liability, which--

05:45.445 --> 05:47.548
My client died
on the doctor's table.

05:47.581 --> 05:51.117
Look, you and I could
debate this ad nauseam.

05:51.151 --> 05:53.854
We're never going
to agree.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.856
And my client is adamant.

05:55.889 --> 06:00.393
So, either we're going
to end this at $32,000,

06:00.426 --> 06:02.495
or we're going to have to
let a jury decide.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.600
We'll be letting
a jury decide.

06:17.443 --> 06:19.513
I didn't know he was a rabbi.
I swear I didn't know.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.081
I understand this,
but, Clyde,

06:21.114 --> 06:22.916
whether you knew
he was a rabbi or not,

06:22.949 --> 06:25.018
it was still illegal
for you to kill him.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.953
Does that mean they're going
to get me, like, on...

06:26.987 --> 06:28.555
one of those hate crimes?

06:28.589 --> 06:30.857
'Cause he's Jewish,
I get nailed with a hate crime?

06:30.891 --> 06:33.093
Clyde, hate crime
isn't your worry.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.895
You're up
on first-degree murder.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.697
You hit a rabbi
over the head with a bat.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.832
But don't they got
to prove intent?

06:38.865 --> 06:41.502
My intent was to rob him.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.637
This is prejudice.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.872
The Jews,
they get special treatment.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.574
You think Jews
get special treatment

06:47.608 --> 06:50.110
on account of you not being able
to hit rabbis with bats?

06:50.143 --> 06:52.646
I just meant to rob him.

06:52.679 --> 06:54.715
I was swinging
for his shoulder blade.

06:56.883 --> 06:58.785
I'm begging you.
Oh, right, I'm Jewish.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.621
I really want to take this
off your hands.

07:00.654 --> 07:01.822
He's not gonna hit you.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.524
Forget it.
Lindsay--

07:03.557 --> 07:05.726
I've got the Witter
depositions all week.
Oh, come on.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.028
What's wrong?
I'm going
into court tomorrow

07:08.061 --> 07:09.796
trying to reopen
on Henry Olson,

07:09.830 --> 07:12.098
the judge just spanked me
with a court-appointed lujack,

07:12.132 --> 07:13.900
and nobody here
will lend a hand,

07:13.934 --> 07:15.936
after I just flew cross-country
to help you.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.938
Jimmy, I can't.
I pushed all my cases--
I'm in a pinch here.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.541
I need some assistance.
All right.
Ellenor, back him up.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.543
Why can't Lindsay do it?
Why can't I just
give it to her?

07:22.576 --> 07:24.578
Because it's
on the news, Jimmy.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.913
There's a big public outcry.
Haven't you been paying
attention?

07:26.947 --> 07:29.115
Well, I got a motion
to reopen on Henry Olson--

07:29.149 --> 07:30.917
I'll help on Olson.
Ellenor...

07:36.089 --> 07:38.759
Basically, they're still
denying blame.

07:38.792 --> 07:42.228
The doctor, evidently,
is reluctant to settle at all.

07:42.262 --> 07:43.797
So what happens now?

07:43.830 --> 07:46.667
Well, we're still scheduled
for trial tomorrow.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.902
You can either take
the 32, which...

07:52.138 --> 07:54.741
Well, our costs right now
are running over 14,

07:54.775 --> 07:56.810
so that plus the contingency,

07:56.843 --> 07:59.746
you'd get about eleven.

07:59.780 --> 08:02.215
Eleven thousand dollars?

08:02.248 --> 08:04.651
You make out
better than us.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.186
Between my time and Eugene's,

08:06.219 --> 08:08.522
we've got over $40,000
invested in this case.

08:08.555 --> 08:10.591
So why are we
even hesitating?

08:10.624 --> 08:12.092
Let's go to trial.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.966
You don't want
to go to trial.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.802
Mrs. Riley, I'll be honest,

08:21.835 --> 08:24.237
this is a very tough case
to win.

08:24.270 --> 08:26.139
Now, I believe
the doctor was negligent,

08:26.172 --> 08:27.541
but proving it...

08:29.576 --> 08:31.678
I know eleven's not much,

08:31.712 --> 08:33.246
but I'm sure
you could use the money.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.984
Is there a woman
that you love, Mr. Young?

08:39.219 --> 08:40.385
Yes.

08:40.419 --> 08:44.925
Well, I'll tell you, the day
comes some doctor kills her,

08:44.958 --> 08:47.928
the day comes
you have to bury her,

08:47.961 --> 08:52.298
I don't think you're gonna
be walking away for $11,000,

08:52.332 --> 08:55.035
whether you could use
the money or not.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.917
How are you doing?

09:11.685 --> 09:12.786
Okay.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.056
They're letting me out
tomorrow.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.791
Did you get me isolation?

09:17.824 --> 09:19.359
(sighs)

09:19.392 --> 09:21.762
They stuck the guys
who did this to you

09:21.795 --> 09:23.930
in the hole, Henry, so...

09:23.964 --> 09:26.700
There'll be others, Jimmy.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.702
I'm a freak.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.804
I'm the guy
with the bug fetish.

09:30.837 --> 09:33.907
Okay.
I'll take care of it.

09:35.709 --> 09:36.943
Meantime...

09:39.946 --> 09:42.783
I got a motion set tomorrow
to reopen your case.

09:43.650 --> 09:45.118
Is there any chance?

09:45.151 --> 09:46.653
I don't know.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.254
But I'm gonna fight.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.724
I promise you
I'm gonna fight.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.598
I, uh...

09:59.766 --> 10:02.302
I never told you
how sorry I am

10:02.335 --> 10:03.904
that he took his life...

10:07.874 --> 10:10.877
on account of me...
No.

10:11.978 --> 10:13.780
It was me.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.649
If I hadn't confronted him...

10:17.851 --> 10:20.020
which I had no legal right
to do--

10:20.053 --> 10:21.855
Jimmy...

10:21.888 --> 10:24.324
Consider who he had
for a father.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.029
You're a good man, Henry.

10:30.196 --> 10:31.898
You've always been
a good man.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.234
Your son knew that.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.040
Yeah.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.076
I'm gonna fight.

11:01.061 --> 11:04.998
I used to date a Jewish girl.
I'm not prejudiced.

11:05.031 --> 11:07.400
I only hit the guy
because he wouldn't
give me his money.

11:07.433 --> 11:09.870
Clyde, will you get off
the Jewish thing?

11:09.903 --> 11:11.872
It don't matter
that the victim was Jewish.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.007
What matters is he's dead.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.909
You don't know what this is
gonna do to my parents.

11:15.942 --> 11:17.811
They're calling you a murderer.
You think they're proud?

11:17.844 --> 11:20.681
ELLENOR: All right, Jimmy.
Forget that he was a rabbi.

11:22.148 --> 11:25.385
All right. Look...

11:25.418 --> 11:28.188
Tell me what you were doing
in that alley to begin with.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.891
I was hiding.
I was waiting to mug somebody.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.292
But I would have hit
any religion, I swear.

11:32.325 --> 11:33.794
Guard!

11:33.827 --> 11:36.262
Look, I'm due in court
on another matter.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.131
I'm gonna come back
after lunch.

11:38.164 --> 11:40.466
Don't talk to anybody,
you hear me? Nobody.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.168
Yeah, fine,
I'm not a talker.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.137
No, you're
a thinker.
Jimmy.

11:44.170 --> 11:46.773
The guy's got the IQ
of a relief pitcher.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.910
It was
a birthday present.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.177
From you
to your husband.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.947
Yes. He just couldn't
take being fat.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.816
So as a birthday gift...

11:55.849 --> 11:58.919
I took him to Dr. Stiles
to talk about liposuction.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.354
And how did you hear
of Dr. Stiles, Mrs. Riley?

12:01.387 --> 12:03.857
I saw his ad.
And when you went
to see him...

12:03.890 --> 12:05.191
Everything was fine.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.094
Uh, he said my husband
was a good candidate.

12:08.128 --> 12:10.296
It was very exciting
for my husband.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.832
He couldn't wait
to do it.

12:11.865 --> 12:15.101
So you decided to go
for the surgery.

12:15.135 --> 12:18.071
Yes. It was just supposed
to be an outpatient thing,

12:18.104 --> 12:23.209
so we arrived at his office
at 7:00 in the morning,

12:23.243 --> 12:25.011
and at, uh...

12:25.045 --> 12:27.848
The procedure
started at 10:00,

12:27.881 --> 12:31.384
and-- and at 1:00,
he, um...

12:32.819 --> 12:35.522
The doctor came out
and told me

12:35.556 --> 12:37.357
that my husband was dead.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.995
Did he say anything else?

12:42.028 --> 12:44.297
No.

12:44.330 --> 12:47.768
Just that he went into cardiac
arrest and he was gone.

12:52.539 --> 12:55.509
Your husband was told
there was a risk.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.110
Minimal risk.

12:57.143 --> 12:59.580
Possible risk of death--
wasn't that one?

12:59.613 --> 13:03.216
Yes. It wasn't
something that--

13:03.249 --> 13:06.319
The message was
that this operation

13:06.352 --> 13:10.090
was safe, Mr. Bradford.
You know that.

13:11.157 --> 13:12.559
Please, understand

13:12.593 --> 13:15.195
just how sorry I am
for your loss.

13:17.163 --> 13:19.365
Mrs. Riley,
who was the first person

13:19.399 --> 13:21.001
to suggest to you

13:21.034 --> 13:23.036
that Dr. Stiles
might have been negligent?

13:23.069 --> 13:25.005
The first person?
Yes.

13:25.038 --> 13:29.409
Well, I-I'm afraid
I don't really understand
the question.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.011
Well, let me state it
another way.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.913
Was it a doctor
or was it a lawyer?

13:32.946 --> 13:35.081
Objection.
What's the point,
Mr. Bradford?

13:35.115 --> 13:36.983
Well, Your Honor,
there are those cases

13:37.017 --> 13:38.885
where a doctor says,
"negligence,"

13:38.919 --> 13:41.121
and the plaintiff
then engages a lawyer,

13:41.154 --> 13:44.457
and there are other cases
where a lawyer
declares negligence,

13:44.490 --> 13:47.460
and doctors
are then rounded up
to bolster the claim.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.896
Objection.
Rephrase it, counsel.

13:49.930 --> 13:53.534
Mrs. Riley, just how many
firms did you go to

13:53.567 --> 13:55.168
before finding one
to take your case?

13:55.201 --> 13:57.337
Objection.
Sidebar, Your Honor?

14:02.475 --> 14:05.211
Part of our defense is that
this is a spurious claim

14:05.245 --> 14:08.582
manufactured to flush out
a deep-pocket insurance company.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.884
It is certainly relevant
that other attorneys

14:10.917 --> 14:12.586
declined to even
take on the matter.

14:12.619 --> 14:14.521
It is certainly not relevant.
How other lawyers

14:14.555 --> 14:16.256
assess this has nothing
to do with the case.

14:16.289 --> 14:19.025
I agree. You're shut down
there, Mr. Bradford.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.361
Step back.
Members of the jury,

14:21.394 --> 14:24.464
whether or not other
attorneys or law firms

14:24.497 --> 14:27.000
elected to represent
the plaintiff in this matter

14:27.033 --> 14:29.503
is without relevance,
and you're to disregard

14:29.536 --> 14:31.505
defense counsel's question.

14:35.008 --> 14:37.443
Let me see
if I understand this.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.946
You learned,
during the trial,

14:39.980 --> 14:41.682
from your client,

14:41.715 --> 14:43.483
that it was his son
that killed the woman?

14:43.517 --> 14:46.352
I learned just before
closing arguments, yes.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.088
Then why didn't you go
to the district attorney

14:48.121 --> 14:49.489
right then and ask him--

14:49.523 --> 14:51.224
JIMMY: Because my client
wouldn't let me.

14:51.257 --> 14:53.393
It was attorney-client
privilege,

14:53.426 --> 14:56.029
and he was looking
to protect his son.

14:56.062 --> 14:58.031
I see. And if your client
had been acquitted,

14:58.064 --> 14:59.633
that would have been
the end of it?

14:59.666 --> 15:02.002
Well--
You wouldn't
be here today

15:02.035 --> 15:03.604
seeking justice,
would you, counsel?

15:03.637 --> 15:05.506
That would have been
the end of it.

15:05.539 --> 15:08.341
Your Honor, my meeting
with the boy--

15:08.374 --> 15:11.044
though he didn't flat-out
admit that he did it,

15:11.077 --> 15:14.347
he didn't deny it, either,
and a failure to deny

15:14.380 --> 15:17.651
can constitute an admission
under the rules of evidence.

15:17.684 --> 15:20.353
The courts don't simply
throw out convictions,

15:20.386 --> 15:21.722
counsel, simply because--

15:21.755 --> 15:24.090
The kid hung himself.
What does that say?

15:24.124 --> 15:26.226
I confronted him
with what he did,

15:26.259 --> 15:28.128
he goes home
and hangs himself.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.530
That isn't evidence.

15:29.563 --> 15:31.297
Then let me offer
evidence.

15:31.331 --> 15:32.599
You haven't got any, Jimmy.

15:32.633 --> 15:35.168
I would like the court
to hear from my client.

15:35.201 --> 15:36.703
This seems like a waste
of the court's time.

15:36.737 --> 15:39.439
He's serving a life sentence.
We can't waste one afternoon?

15:39.472 --> 15:41.407
If we gave one afternoon

15:41.441 --> 15:43.677
to every man serving
a life sentence, counsel,

15:43.710 --> 15:46.246
the courts would be
jammed beyond repair.

15:47.614 --> 15:51.017
As an officer of the court,
I'm telling you,

15:51.051 --> 15:52.418
I've never done this.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.188
I swallow the defeats
like anyone else.

15:55.221 --> 15:56.489
But this one...

15:58.224 --> 15:59.492
Please, Your Honor.

16:01.094 --> 16:02.629
Give me one day.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.235
One day.

16:09.269 --> 16:10.637
(bangs gavel)

16:10.671 --> 16:13.073
BAY: I don't know what you
really plan to accomplish.

16:13.106 --> 16:15.075
I plan to accomplish
getting him out of prison,

16:15.108 --> 16:16.442
which he should be.
Yeah, right.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.111
Look, how about
we get together on Miller?

16:18.144 --> 16:20.480
Fine. Cooperate with me on
Olson, I'll talk on Miller.

16:20.514 --> 16:22.448
Don't insult
my intelligence, Jimmy.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.018
I was insulting
your integrity.

16:32.092 --> 16:35.228
MAN: Fluid is actually being
pumped into the body
at this point.

16:35.261 --> 16:39.099
It's pretty much a salt solution
containing a local anesthetic.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.233
What kind of anesthetic?

16:40.266 --> 16:43.103
Lidocaine.
It numbs the patient.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.238
Is this a difficult
procedure, doctor?

16:45.271 --> 16:47.073
It's quite simple,
actually,

16:47.107 --> 16:48.609
which is part
of the problem.

16:48.642 --> 16:51.745
We've got dentists doing it,
dermatologists.

16:51.778 --> 16:54.414
It's lucrative, and a lot
of doctors want in.

16:54.447 --> 16:57.117
And if they're not careful,
the procedure can be lethal,

16:57.150 --> 16:58.619
as it was in this case.

16:58.652 --> 17:01.454
REBECCA: What happened
to Morris Riley?

17:01.487 --> 17:04.525
The first mistake
was taking so much fat out.

17:04.558 --> 17:07.694
Anything over 15 percent,
in my view, is unsafe.

17:07.728 --> 17:09.362
Is this what killed him?

17:09.395 --> 17:11.497
No. In my opinion,

17:11.531 --> 17:13.767
Mr. Riley suffered
from a lidocaine overdose.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.536
The lidocaine
lowered the heart rate,

17:15.569 --> 17:17.403
eventually causing
cardiac arrest,

17:17.436 --> 17:19.673
and since he did this
in his office

17:19.705 --> 17:21.406
instead of at the hospital,

17:21.441 --> 17:23.276
he didn't have
the necessary technology

17:23.309 --> 17:25.811
or personnel available
to respond to the crisis.

17:27.748 --> 17:31.652
You weren't in the room,
were you, Dr. Willis?
No, I was not.

17:31.685 --> 17:33.654
Have you ever performed
a liposuction procedure, sir?

17:33.687 --> 17:35.421
I've done hundreds.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.691
Hundreds.
Any in your office?

17:37.724 --> 17:39.593
Almost all of them.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.762
I see. So this decision
not to go into a hospital,

17:41.795 --> 17:43.429
you make that decision
all the time.

17:43.463 --> 17:46.399
I would never take that much
fat out in my office.

17:46.432 --> 17:48.802
If I were going to remove
more than 12 pounds,

17:48.835 --> 17:50.704
I would have done it
in a hospital.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.574
That's a very good answer,
doctor.

17:53.607 --> 17:55.842
Can you state
to a medical certainty

17:55.876 --> 17:58.712
that Mr. Riley died
from a lidocaine overdose?

17:58.745 --> 18:01.147
I can state it
to a reasonable certainty.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.183
But not to an absolute
medical certainty?

18:03.216 --> 18:04.685
That can almost never
be done, counselor.

18:04.718 --> 18:06.787
I see, and have you
ever known hearts

18:06.820 --> 18:08.755
to go into arrest
during this procedure

18:08.789 --> 18:10.691
absent a lidocaine overdose?

18:10.724 --> 18:12.726
Of course.
That's possible here,
isn't it, doctor?

18:12.759 --> 18:15.862
Possible, but my opinion is
they overloaded him with fluids.

18:15.896 --> 18:19.700
I see. Tell me, doctor,
how many trials

18:19.733 --> 18:22.435
have you testified in
over the last year?

18:22.468 --> 18:24.370
Many.
Many?

18:24.404 --> 18:25.706
More than 50?

18:25.739 --> 18:27.508
Around 50.

18:27.541 --> 18:29.375
And would it be fair
to say, sir,

18:29.409 --> 18:31.411
that you are primarily hired
by these types

18:31.444 --> 18:33.847
of plaintiff law firms--
Objection.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.883
Sustained.
BRADFORD: Let me rephrase.

18:36.917 --> 18:39.520
You've been hired by this law
firm before, haven't you, sir?

18:39.553 --> 18:41.221
Objection.
What's the relevance?

18:41.254 --> 18:43.624
It goes to bias, Your Honor.
He's been hired in the past

18:43.657 --> 18:45.491
and will be hired
in the future.

18:45.526 --> 18:47.260
This witness has incentive

18:47.293 --> 18:49.462
to satisfy personal-injury
law firms.

18:49.495 --> 18:51.632
REBECCA: Objection!
Objection.
Move to strike that.

18:51.665 --> 18:54.434
I'm going to overrule
the objection,

18:54.467 --> 18:57.270
but I'm closing the door
on this line of questioning.

18:58.404 --> 18:59.640
In that case,
I'm done, Your Honor.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.964
You know what's going on.
He's putting us on trial.

19:23.997 --> 19:27.333
He wants the jury
to associate this case
with you and me.

19:39.012 --> 19:42.783
All I can tell you at this time
is the suspect passed
a psychiatric exam,

19:42.816 --> 19:44.284
which means he's competent
to stand trial.

19:44.317 --> 19:45.719
Was the baseball bat found?

19:45.752 --> 19:47.654
I'm not gonna comment
on the evidence at this time.

19:47.688 --> 19:49.756
When there's further
developments, I'll
keep you apprised.

19:49.790 --> 19:51.558
Were you surprised this
case was assigned to you

19:51.592 --> 19:53.694
after so many recent
high-profile flops?

19:53.727 --> 19:55.896
(cameras clicking)

19:55.929 --> 19:58.464
There's no
strategy here.

19:58.498 --> 20:00.000
Just speak
from the heart.

20:00.033 --> 20:04.871
Okay. Will I have to
get into the, uh...

20:06.439 --> 20:07.574
Bugs?

20:07.608 --> 20:09.409
You might.

20:09.442 --> 20:12.245
You may have to
open yourself up
in there, Henry.

20:12.278 --> 20:15.516
Our only chance
is if the judge
believes you.

20:15.549 --> 20:17.283
If he thinks you're
hiding anything...

20:17.317 --> 20:18.519
Okay.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.488
Should Allison be there?

20:23.489 --> 20:24.991
It couldn't hurt.

20:27.528 --> 20:28.729
(sighs)

20:30.330 --> 20:32.498
Everything was going fine,
and then suddenly,

20:32.533 --> 20:34.034
his blood pressure
just plunged.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.002
Did you know why?
No.

20:36.036 --> 20:38.672
There's always a risk
in any surgery.

20:38.705 --> 20:41.374
I do know we didn't
overload fluids.

20:41.407 --> 20:45.011
When Mr. Riley's heart
went into arrest,
what did you do?

20:45.045 --> 20:47.981
We massaged the chest,
brought in a defibrillator,

20:48.014 --> 20:50.917
started the heart again,
but then it stopped.

20:50.951 --> 20:52.719
We wheeled in a crash cart.

20:52.753 --> 20:54.588
Contrary to Dr. Wills'
assertion,

20:54.621 --> 20:57.791
we did have the technology
to respond to this crisis.

20:57.824 --> 21:02.529
Dr. Stiles, Mr. Riley
did die on your table.

21:02.563 --> 21:04.497
I know.

21:04.531 --> 21:07.333
And it was devastating
for all of us.

21:07.367 --> 21:12.038
But... death is a risk
in every surgery.

21:12.072 --> 21:15.809
Sometimes, whether it be
heart failure

21:15.842 --> 21:19.045
or reaction to anesthesia,

21:19.079 --> 21:22.382
unforeseen circumstances
take a life.

21:22.415 --> 21:24.518
All I can assure you of,

21:24.551 --> 21:27.020
as I've assured Mrs. Riley,

21:27.053 --> 21:30.524
is that everything
was done right in that room.

21:30.557 --> 21:33.426
This is not a death due
to doctor error.

21:35.929 --> 21:38.464
Did you have
a cardiothoracic surgeon?

21:38.498 --> 21:39.833
I beg your pardon?

21:39.866 --> 21:42.669
Did you have
a cardiothoracic surgeon,

21:42.703 --> 21:45.071
somebody who could
open up the patient's chest,

21:45.105 --> 21:47.774
massage the heart,
maybe put him on bypass even?

21:47.808 --> 21:49.943
Did you have such a doctor
in your office?

21:49.976 --> 21:53.847
No.
A hospital would have, right?

21:53.880 --> 21:56.349
How long have you been
performing liposuctions, sir?

21:56.382 --> 21:58.552
I've been doing them
for about two years.

21:58.585 --> 22:00.621
You are a cosmetic surgeon
who specializes

22:00.654 --> 22:02.355
on face reconstruction,
aren't you?

22:02.388 --> 22:03.857
If you're suggesting

22:03.890 --> 22:05.726
that I'm not qualified
to do the procedure--

22:05.759 --> 22:07.628
I'm suggesting
this isn't your specialty.

22:07.661 --> 22:09.663
I'm suggesting that
up until two years ago,

22:09.696 --> 22:11.632
you worked on faces
and burn victims,

22:11.665 --> 22:13.567
but you didn't do liposuctions,
isn't that correct?

22:13.600 --> 22:15.902
I'm sorry. I have to object
to this assault.

22:15.936 --> 22:17.003
This is an assault?

22:17.037 --> 22:18.471
(scoffs) Your Honor,

22:18.505 --> 22:20.574
I have a personal affection
for Mr. Young.

22:20.607 --> 22:22.108
I think he's a fine attorney.

22:22.142 --> 22:25.045
Perhaps a reminder
that this is a civil trial?

22:25.078 --> 22:26.747
Your Honor--
JUDGE MICHAELSON:
Never mind.

22:26.780 --> 22:29.783
I'm overruling the objection.
Mr. Young, proceed.

22:29.816 --> 22:32.986
You sucked out 22 pounds
of fat, didn't you, doctor?

22:33.019 --> 22:34.588
Yes.
You are aware

22:34.621 --> 22:36.089
that's more than what's
considered to be safe--

22:36.122 --> 22:39.059
You can't quantify safety
with statistics.

22:39.092 --> 22:40.827
It's done
on a case-by-case basis,

22:40.861 --> 22:43.129
and in this case,
I felt it was safe.

22:43.163 --> 22:44.998
And he died.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.733
Not because I took out
too much fat.

22:46.767 --> 22:49.970
Well, as-- as I understand it,
the more fat you suction out,

22:50.003 --> 22:52.005
the more trauma to the body,
is that correct?

22:52.038 --> 22:53.974
Yes.
And the more
lidocaine needed--

22:54.007 --> 22:57.077
This patient did not die
from a lidocaine overdose.

22:57.110 --> 22:58.845
You know that to
a medical certainty?

22:58.879 --> 23:01.748
As I said, you can never know
anything to a medical certainty.

23:01.782 --> 23:03.083
Then why are you saying it
with such certainty?

23:03.116 --> 23:05.451
Objection.
Withdrawn.
How much do you charge

23:05.485 --> 23:08.755
for this kind of procedure?
I charged Mr. Riley $8,000.

23:08.789 --> 23:11.024
And that's up-front, right?
No insurance to deal with?

23:11.057 --> 23:12.693
How is this relevant?

23:12.726 --> 23:14.194
It is relevant because you're
in the business of sucking

23:14.227 --> 23:16.462
fat out of people
without any concern--
Objection!

23:16.496 --> 23:18.498
You can save your personal
affection, Mr. Bradford.

23:18.532 --> 23:22.435
All right!
This is a court of law,
not a street fight.

23:22.468 --> 23:24.771
What did you say?
JUDGE MICHAELSON: That's enough!

23:25.939 --> 23:28.041
(sighs)

23:28.074 --> 23:29.776
Your Honor,

23:29.810 --> 23:32.546
I apologize both to you
and the jury

23:32.579 --> 23:36.016
for this...
unnecessary acrimony.

23:37.250 --> 23:39.085
Mr. Young,
return your attention

23:39.119 --> 23:41.454
to the witness, please.

23:45.158 --> 23:49.095
Mr. Olson, at trial,

23:49.129 --> 23:52.833
you said when you came
out of your office,

23:52.866 --> 23:55.468
you found the woman dead.

23:55.502 --> 23:56.937
Did you see anything else?

23:56.970 --> 23:58.104
HENRY: Yes.

23:58.138 --> 24:02.108
I saw my son Steven.
He was leaving.

24:02.142 --> 24:06.212
Your son Steven.
Yes.

24:06.246 --> 24:07.948
But you never
told anybody.

24:07.981 --> 24:11.985
I told you,
deep into the trial,

24:12.018 --> 24:15.088
only because you were
going to accuse my wife.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.090
Why did you keep this secret?

24:19.159 --> 24:23.229
He had his whole life
ahead of him, Your Honor.

24:23.263 --> 24:25.799
Me...

24:25.832 --> 24:27.167
I'm...

24:28.301 --> 24:32.573
I was a perverted deviant,

24:32.606 --> 24:35.175
who liked to watch women
step on bugs.

24:37.310 --> 24:41.014
I am the reason
that he committed this crime.

24:41.047 --> 24:43.850
I drove him
to commit this crime.

24:44.985 --> 24:46.853
He'd heard his mother and me

24:46.887 --> 24:49.089
arguing about my fetish.

24:50.924 --> 24:53.594
My attorneys told me
that I had a chance

24:53.627 --> 24:57.130
of winning a trial,
so I took the chance,

24:57.163 --> 24:59.700
figuring if I could get
out of prison...

25:01.635 --> 25:03.637
...I could get Steven
some help.

25:12.245 --> 25:14.147
Why should we believe you?

25:14.180 --> 25:16.316
Because I'm telling
the truth.

25:16.349 --> 25:17.951
Well, your son is dead.

25:17.984 --> 25:20.053
He can't defend himself
to these charges.

25:20.086 --> 25:22.288
I told Mr. Berluti
before he was dead.

25:22.322 --> 25:23.890
Even if you did,

25:23.924 --> 25:25.559
all of this coincides
with your motive

25:25.592 --> 25:27.794
to be cleared of this crime,

25:27.828 --> 25:30.296
and all we have
is your word here,

25:30.330 --> 25:31.865
isn't that right,
Mr. Olson?

25:33.299 --> 25:35.669
You lied to your wife
about this bug thing.

25:35.702 --> 25:37.704
You kept the truth
from your own attorneys.

25:37.738 --> 25:40.340
That is, if this
latest version is the truth.

25:40.373 --> 25:43.109
We have a conviction here
supported by evidence,

25:43.143 --> 25:44.911
which you're trying
to overturn

25:44.945 --> 25:47.781
with nothing
but your word of honor.

25:47.814 --> 25:49.950
And my affidavit.

25:49.983 --> 25:53.053
I accused the son, Steven,
of killing this woman.

25:53.086 --> 25:55.121
He didn't deny it.

25:55.155 --> 25:58.124
Instead, he goes home
and kills himself.

25:58.158 --> 26:00.861
We have a tremendous
injustice here.

26:00.894 --> 26:03.730
An innocent man
is sitting in jail

26:03.764 --> 26:05.832
for a crime he didn't commit.

26:05.866 --> 26:07.901
We can't just sit back
and say,

26:07.934 --> 26:10.003
"Too late. Game's over."

26:10.036 --> 26:12.005
It's not too late.

26:12.038 --> 26:14.107
There he still sits.

26:14.140 --> 26:16.843
It's not too late.

26:16.877 --> 26:21.147
We all say, "Better to let
ten guilty men go free

26:21.181 --> 26:24.851
than send one innocent man
to jail,"

26:24.885 --> 26:29.322
And still he sits
in prison, innocent.

26:29.355 --> 26:32.893
He didn't kill that woman.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.663
Mr. Berluti, I'm impressed
with your passion,

26:36.697 --> 26:39.165
and I don't dismiss
the value of your affidavit,

26:39.199 --> 26:42.669
but still,
we have a process here.

26:42.703 --> 26:45.038
The jury listened
to every witness,

26:45.071 --> 26:48.041
they deliberated,
and they returned a verdict,

26:48.074 --> 26:49.843
and I certainly
have to have more

26:49.876 --> 26:51.945
than a defendant's word
and an attorney's word

26:51.978 --> 26:53.379
that he's innocent.

26:53.413 --> 26:56.016
Otherwise,
I'd be making a mockery

26:56.049 --> 26:57.884
of the jury system
altogether.

26:57.918 --> 27:02.388
It's one thing if the DA
was coming forward with you,

27:02.422 --> 27:05.826
saying an injustice
has been done, but here...

27:08.862 --> 27:11.131
All I have is you,

27:11.164 --> 27:14.034
the man's lawyer,
the man's friend,

27:14.067 --> 27:15.869
protesting his innocence.

27:18.071 --> 27:19.673
The conviction stands.

27:19.706 --> 27:21.207
Adjourned.
(gavel bangs)

27:22.809 --> 27:24.778
(crowd murmuring)

27:49.503 --> 27:51.271
Come on, Jimmy.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.185
I think we should
call him on it.

28:05.218 --> 28:06.486
I mean, how can we
just sit back--

28:06.520 --> 28:08.021
We stick to the case,
Rebecca.

28:08.054 --> 28:11.191
But he's not.
You know he's not.

28:11.224 --> 28:13.093
We play any other card
at this point,

28:13.126 --> 28:14.795
we just look desperate.

28:14.828 --> 28:16.329
We stick to the merits
of the case.

28:23.770 --> 28:25.806
(indistinct chatter)

28:32.979 --> 28:34.915
You're wasting
your time, Jimmy.

28:34.948 --> 28:36.282
What, you think you're
going to liquor me up--

28:36.316 --> 28:38.484
Suppose I deliver
the rabbi killer,

28:39.385 --> 28:40.386
Murder Two.

28:43.557 --> 28:47.093
Clyde Miller
for Henry Olson,
straight up.

28:48.094 --> 28:49.429
First of all,

28:49.462 --> 28:51.898
what you're proposing
is so unethical.

28:51.932 --> 28:53.534
Which is why
I never proposed it.

28:53.567 --> 28:56.369
Second, I don't need
any favors on Miller.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.538
We got the guy.

28:57.571 --> 28:59.072
No, you don't, Richard.

28:59.105 --> 29:01.341
Prints on the bat,
rabbi's DNA all over it.

29:01.374 --> 29:03.944
He found the rabbi dead
in the alley,

29:03.977 --> 29:05.311
decided to rob him.

29:05.345 --> 29:06.947
Is that his story?

29:06.980 --> 29:10.551
Could be, and you can't
completely disprove it.

29:10.584 --> 29:12.519
The guy's got an assault
record as long as my--

29:12.553 --> 29:15.355
Yeah, history of mugging,
not killing,

29:15.388 --> 29:18.091
and all we need
is one lone juror.

29:18.124 --> 29:21.294
High-profile case,
public outrage.

29:21.327 --> 29:24.497
You lose this one,
Richard...

29:24.531 --> 29:26.967
I know you don't want
to think about that.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.935
I won't lose it, Jimmy.

29:28.969 --> 29:31.104
Save your breath trying
to intimidate me.

29:31.137 --> 29:33.173
I got an innocent man

29:33.206 --> 29:35.542
and a way to make things
easy for you.

29:35.576 --> 29:39.312
It's win/win,
justice/justice.

29:43.083 --> 29:46.587
If-- I say if--

29:46.620 --> 29:48.889
Olson passes a polygraph...

29:50.490 --> 29:53.259
...I will consider a joint
recommendation to the court.

29:58.599 --> 30:01.067
On a completely
unrelated matter,

30:01.101 --> 30:03.069
I'm offering Clyde Miller
Murder Two.

30:15.215 --> 30:18.284
Res ipsa loquitor.

30:18.318 --> 30:21.221
That's a Latin term
which basically means,

30:21.254 --> 30:24.157
"What happened
speaks for itself."

30:24.190 --> 30:27.160
And that's what we have here.

30:27.193 --> 30:30.430
That man was in exclusive
control of the situation.

30:30.463 --> 30:33.233
The patient died,
in a procedure where injury

30:33.266 --> 30:34.635
does not normally occur.

30:34.668 --> 30:36.369
After going in for liposuction,

30:36.402 --> 30:39.105
a procedure so simple
dentists are now doing it,

30:39.139 --> 30:42.008
he came out dead,
and the doctor's response is,

30:42.042 --> 30:44.511
"Sometimes it happens.
Patients die."

30:44.545 --> 30:46.913
And you know why he died,
ladies and gentlemen?

30:46.947 --> 30:49.049
Money. Money.

30:49.082 --> 30:50.951
With HMOs cutting costs,

30:50.984 --> 30:53.019
with hospitals
slashing doctors' salaries,

30:53.053 --> 30:56.256
surgeons are turning
to cosmetic surgery
to heat their pools.

30:56.289 --> 30:58.458
Forget having to wait
for insurance reimbursements.

30:58.491 --> 31:01.194
These procedures aren't
covered by insurance.

31:01.227 --> 31:02.495
The money's up-front--

31:02.529 --> 31:04.998
Six, seven, eight
thousand dollars a pop

31:05.031 --> 31:07.400
for liposuction,
and we're talking
about cash, people.

31:07.433 --> 31:09.536
And they do it
right in their offices,

31:09.570 --> 31:12.539
'cause you start cutting profits
when you do it in a hospital.

31:12.573 --> 31:16.543
Which is okay
when things go right, I guess.

31:16.577 --> 31:19.179
But when things go wrong?

31:19.212 --> 31:24.117
Morris Riley-- death.

31:27.320 --> 31:31.925
He took out 22 pounds of fat,
too much by medical standards.

31:31.958 --> 31:35.095
He had to load him
with extra lidocaine
in order to do it.

31:35.128 --> 31:37.363
Lidocaine-- a drug
that slows the pulse,

31:37.397 --> 31:39.465
a drug that affects the heart.

31:39.499 --> 31:42.068
And he did it in his office
with no cardiologist

31:42.102 --> 31:44.104
and no cardiothoracic surgeon
in the building.

31:44.137 --> 31:47.473
This should have been done
in a hospital.

31:47.508 --> 31:49.543
Something went terribly wrong.

31:49.576 --> 31:52.112
Simple procedure,
patient dies--

31:52.145 --> 31:55.315
something went terribly wrong.

31:56.482 --> 32:00.153
Res ipsa loquitor.

32:03.524 --> 32:05.091
Murder Two?

32:05.125 --> 32:06.960
Man, isn't that like life?

32:06.993 --> 32:09.630
It is,
but with parole, maybe.

32:09.663 --> 32:13.099
If you go down
on Murder One, forget it.

32:13.133 --> 32:15.536
And you don't think
that we could beat it?

32:15.569 --> 32:17.303
O.J.-- he beat it.

32:17.337 --> 32:20.473
Honest--
we could take the shot,

32:20.507 --> 32:22.408
but I don't think we'd win,

32:22.442 --> 32:25.546
in which case, you are
looking at Murder One.

32:25.579 --> 32:27.480
I think, if we can
make this go away,

32:27.514 --> 32:31.351
quiet, with Murder Two,

32:31.384 --> 32:33.186
you'd be crazy
not to take it.

32:42.262 --> 32:44.598
Never mind there's been
no negligence.

32:46.099 --> 32:48.368
Never mind
nobody did anything wrong.

32:48.401 --> 32:51.271
Go to court,
roll the dice,

32:51.304 --> 32:53.006
and hope for a jackpot.

32:54.174 --> 32:55.709
Didn't used to be this way,

32:55.742 --> 32:59.045
but with the proliferation
of law schools

32:59.079 --> 33:01.548
and the lowering of the bar,
if you will,

33:01.582 --> 33:04.651
we have a glut of attorneys

33:04.685 --> 33:07.588
and a resulting boom
of litigation to feed them.

33:07.621 --> 33:10.056
And accordingly,

33:10.090 --> 33:14.460
you can always find a lawyer
to take your case today,

33:14.494 --> 33:17.664
and Mrs. Riley found
two very capable ones

33:17.698 --> 33:19.566
to take hers, didn't she?

33:20.734 --> 33:22.536
The problem is,

33:22.569 --> 33:25.071
she has no evidence

33:25.105 --> 33:27.641
to establish any wrongdoing

33:27.674 --> 33:29.409
by Dr. Stiles.

33:30.544 --> 33:34.380
But we had
an unfortunate result,

33:34.414 --> 33:37.450
and therefore
we are automatically leaping

33:37.483 --> 33:39.285
to negligence.

33:39.319 --> 33:41.655
Mr. Young even admitted
as much, didn't he?

33:41.688 --> 33:46.092
When he stood up here saying,
res ipsa loquitor.

33:46.126 --> 33:47.794
Let's presume it.

33:49.495 --> 33:54.100
I have compassion
for Mrs. Riley's pain

33:54.134 --> 33:55.201
as I'm sure you do.

33:55.235 --> 34:00.541
Her husband's heart gave out,
as hearts sometimes do.

34:01.675 --> 34:04.545
There is a tragedy here,
no question.

34:06.112 --> 34:09.248
But there is no malpractice.

34:18.291 --> 34:20.193
Mr. Young, rebuttal.

34:24.330 --> 34:28.168
Whether there
is malpractice or not,

34:28.201 --> 34:30.469
that is your decision.

34:30.504 --> 34:32.272
But I hope
you don't think less

34:32.304 --> 34:34.107
of Mrs. Riley's cause
of action,

34:34.139 --> 34:36.710
because of the lawyer
she found to represent her.

34:36.743 --> 34:38.478
Well-- don't get me wrong.

34:38.512 --> 34:41.848
Like Mr. Bradford said,
we're capable attorneys.

34:41.882 --> 34:44.751
I think we're even a credit
to our profession.

34:44.784 --> 34:48.321
But let's face it,
we're not the best.

34:48.353 --> 34:51.456
We've come a long way,
we've made some progress,

34:51.491 --> 34:54.393
but we're just not
the first choice, are we?

34:54.427 --> 34:55.696
What's going on here?

34:55.728 --> 34:57.297
What's going on

34:57.330 --> 34:59.600
with the proliferation
of law schools

34:59.633 --> 35:01.702
and the lowering of the bar?

35:01.735 --> 35:04.204
And more and more
attorneys like us

35:04.237 --> 35:06.139
are finding our way
into this room.

35:06.172 --> 35:09.309
I'm agreeing with you,
Mr. Bradford.

35:09.342 --> 35:10.811
Counsel, if you're not
gonna argue the evidence,

35:10.844 --> 35:12.779
I'll ask you to return
to your seat.

35:12.813 --> 35:17.283
Mr. Young and I are very much
in evidence, Your Honor.

35:17.317 --> 35:21.187
Mr. Bradford put us
in evidence.

35:21.221 --> 35:22.656
He asked Mrs. Riley,

35:22.689 --> 35:24.625
who first told her
there was negligence?

35:24.658 --> 35:27.460
Was it a doctor
or was it your lawyer?

35:27.493 --> 35:29.896
He asked her, "How many
law firms did you visit

35:29.930 --> 35:33.333
before you found an attorney
willing to take your case?"

35:33.366 --> 35:37.170
He asked our expert witness
if he was regularly hired

35:37.203 --> 35:40.774
by these types
of plaintiff law firms.

35:40.807 --> 35:44.377
He announces his personal
affection for Mr. Young

35:44.410 --> 35:47.247
and then reminds him
this isn't a street fight?

35:48.481 --> 35:50.684
We are very much
in evidence, Your Honor,

35:50.717 --> 35:52.218
and I don't like it.

35:53.520 --> 35:54.755
I don't like it one bit.

35:54.788 --> 35:56.923
Ms. Washington,
I'll ask you once again.

35:56.957 --> 35:59.626
Please confine your remarks
to the case.

36:02.863 --> 36:05.198
Wife saves up money

36:05.231 --> 36:08.702
to give her husband
a liposuction procedure.

36:09.736 --> 36:11.404
They go to a doctor,

36:11.437 --> 36:15.408
doctor performs the procedure,
husband dies.

36:16.510 --> 36:18.512
That's a pretty good case.

36:18.545 --> 36:20.614
Now, imagine how strong
it would be

36:20.647 --> 36:24.518
if Mrs. Riley had found
the right kind of lawyers.

36:38.765 --> 36:40.333
(door slams)
I didn't do anything.

36:40.366 --> 36:41.702
Where's Jimmy?
Right here. What's--

36:41.735 --> 36:43.269
You signed off
on Murder Two

36:43.303 --> 36:45.471
with Clyde Miller?
Just like that?

36:45.506 --> 36:47.674
We had a take it
or leave it--
one-time offer.

36:47.708 --> 36:48.942
So, why did you take it?

36:48.975 --> 36:50.544
Because he was looking
at first degree.

36:50.577 --> 36:51.945
Well, we still could have
tried the thing.

36:51.978 --> 36:54.447
And lost.
But maybe won.
Their evidence--

36:54.480 --> 36:55.649
Oh, please.

36:55.682 --> 36:57.751
Jimmy,
there were no witnesses.

36:57.784 --> 36:59.319
I just beat a much tougher case
than this one

36:59.352 --> 37:00.654
a month ago
with Darryl Hutchins.

37:00.687 --> 37:02.355
What's going on?

37:02.388 --> 37:04.257
Clyde Miller-- He just
copped a second degree.

37:04.290 --> 37:05.859
There were no rabbits to
pull on this one, Ellenor.

37:05.892 --> 37:08.494
They had him
dead to center.
Even so, Jimmy,

37:08.529 --> 37:11.331
this seems a little rushed,
and since I am second chair...
(phone rings)

37:11.364 --> 37:13.433
I think you could have
run this by me before--

37:13.466 --> 37:15.536
I didn't think you really
wanted to be bothered.

37:16.837 --> 37:18.972
Good news.
Henry passed the polygraph.

37:19.005 --> 37:21.708
He did?
Yes. They're transferring him
to the courthouse.

37:22.809 --> 37:24.545
What's he taking
the polygraph for?

37:24.578 --> 37:26.479
Richard Bay--
I worked him up last night.

37:26.513 --> 37:27.948
He said if Henry passed
a lie detector,

37:27.981 --> 37:29.415
he'd endorse his release.

37:29.449 --> 37:31.585
Bay's going to recommend
release now?

37:31.618 --> 37:33.687
He said a polygraph
would sell him.

37:34.855 --> 37:36.590
Richard Bay's
the DA on...

37:37.924 --> 37:39.492
...Clyde Miller.

37:44.531 --> 37:45.766
Oh, my God.

37:45.799 --> 37:48.635
Tell me.
In my office.

37:48.669 --> 37:51.004
I can't. They're transferring
Henry back to the courthouse.

37:51.037 --> 37:52.639
In my office.

37:58.679 --> 38:01.014
You served up Miller
to get Henry out?

38:01.047 --> 38:03.349
I made independent deals.
Don't screw with me, Jimmy.

38:03.383 --> 38:04.818
I made separate deals
for two--

38:04.851 --> 38:06.352
You don't just cop
to Murder Two.

38:06.386 --> 38:07.721
Judgment call, and don't tell me

38:07.754 --> 38:08.855
you've never done it.
You could get disbarred!

38:08.889 --> 38:10.757
I know you've done it.
I'm talking here!

38:10.791 --> 38:12.526
And I'm not listening!
Shut up!

38:13.760 --> 38:16.630
Don't you--
Don't you dare
put yourself

38:16.663 --> 38:18.431
in my position.

38:18.464 --> 38:20.867
A man isn't in jail
'cause of you.

38:20.901 --> 38:24.104
A kid didn't put a noose
around his neck 'cause of you.

38:24.137 --> 38:25.972
You're falling apart.

38:26.006 --> 38:27.808
Of course
I'm falling apart!

38:27.841 --> 38:30.043
I've been falling apart
for three months. I--

38:30.076 --> 38:32.412
(breathing heavily)
Look at me.

38:32.445 --> 38:34.648
I put on 50 pounds.
Why do you think?

38:36.382 --> 38:38.619
I gotta fix this, Bobby.
I won't let you.

38:39.019 --> 38:40.554
You just stay
the hell out of it!

38:40.587 --> 38:43.456
I can't! Clyde Miller
is a client of this firm.

38:43.489 --> 38:45.458
I explained the deal to him.
He took it.

38:45.491 --> 38:47.127
He's stupid.
He'll do whatever you say.

38:47.160 --> 38:49.563
You keep out of it!
You want to fire me, fire me,

38:49.596 --> 38:51.798
but I got to fix this!

38:58.438 --> 39:01.407
He's a killer.
He killed a rabbi.

39:01.441 --> 39:02.743
He should be in jail.

39:03.877 --> 39:06.647
Henry Olson shouldn't be.

39:06.680 --> 39:08.615
This is a just result.

39:11.451 --> 39:13.587
It doesn't work
like that, Jimmy.

39:14.721 --> 39:17.457
Please.

39:17.490 --> 39:21.427
Two separate deals,
two different cases.

39:21.461 --> 39:23.730
He'd go down on Murder One
if we tried it.

39:24.731 --> 39:26.767
Just let this be.

39:33.707 --> 39:35.542
Just let this be.

39:49.455 --> 39:51.558
How long will it take?

39:53.459 --> 39:55.829
It could take some time.

39:55.862 --> 39:58.031
They first have to decide
on liability.

39:58.064 --> 40:00.433
If they find him negligent,

40:00.466 --> 40:02.102
then they go to damages.

40:02.969 --> 40:04.137
It could take some time.

40:17.851 --> 40:19.119
You angry?

40:21.855 --> 40:23.657
I just don't know
that you helped, Rebecca.

40:23.690 --> 40:24.758
It was in the air.

40:24.791 --> 40:27.528
I wasn't playing cards.
I promise.

40:31.131 --> 40:32.966
I just had to clear
some air.

40:52.953 --> 40:54.821
This is way too fast.

40:54.855 --> 40:56.222
Tell me about it.

41:03.296 --> 41:06.032
Mr. Foreman, the jury
has reached a verdict?

41:06.066 --> 41:07.601
We have, Your Honor.

41:07.634 --> 41:09.670
What say you?

41:09.703 --> 41:11.104
On question one,

41:11.137 --> 41:12.973
do we find
the defendant negligent?

41:13.006 --> 41:14.875
We, the jury answer yes.

41:16.242 --> 41:18.178
On question two,

41:18.211 --> 41:19.746
do we find
the defendant's negligence

41:19.780 --> 41:22.716
to be the proximate cause
of Morris Riley's death?

41:22.749 --> 41:24.217
We the jury answer yes.

41:26.987 --> 41:28.288
We further order
the defendant

41:28.321 --> 41:30.757
to pay damages
to the plaintiff

41:30.791 --> 41:32.926
in the amount
of six million dollars.

41:32.959 --> 41:35.195
(people gasping, murmuring)

41:36.697 --> 41:38.665
Did he say--

41:38.699 --> 41:40.100
What did he say?

41:40.133 --> 41:42.135
He sure didn't
say 32,000.

41:42.168 --> 41:43.870
Six million?

41:46.840 --> 41:48.842
Your Honor,
we move for a judgment

41:48.875 --> 41:50.176
notwithstanding the verdict

41:50.210 --> 41:52.245
and ask that the award
be put aside.

41:52.278 --> 41:54.848
Denied.
This matter is adjourned.

41:54.881 --> 41:57.851
Members of the jury,
thank you for your service.

41:57.884 --> 41:59.052
(bangs gavel)

42:01.988 --> 42:03.156
I win?

42:03.189 --> 42:04.991
You can count on an appeal.

42:05.759 --> 42:07.093
But yeah, you win.

42:15.769 --> 42:19.172
Mr. Bay, I must say,
I didn't expect this.

42:19.205 --> 42:21.842
BAY: Your Honor, Mr. Berluti's
verified affidavit,

42:21.875 --> 42:23.610
the boy's suicide--

42:23.644 --> 42:26.312
I have to admit
it gives me serious pause.

42:26.346 --> 42:29.115
Then this morning,
Mr. Olson took a polygraph,

42:29.149 --> 42:30.751
which he passed.

42:30.784 --> 42:32.619
Though that's not
legally admissible,

42:32.653 --> 42:34.788
it should certainly
be deemed reliable,

42:34.821 --> 42:37.323
and, well, the Commonwealth
no longer believes

42:37.357 --> 42:39.593
he committed the crime.

42:39.626 --> 42:41.862
At the minimum,
he should be granted
a new trial.

42:41.895 --> 42:44.197
And if granted a new trial,

42:44.230 --> 42:45.699
would the Commonwealth
pursue it?

42:45.732 --> 42:47.300
No, Your Honor.

42:47.333 --> 42:49.169
We couldn't proceed
in good faith at this point.

42:49.202 --> 42:52.806
Well, then I'm certainly not
gonna waste anybody's time.

42:54.140 --> 42:56.176
Mr. Olson,
you're a free man.

42:56.209 --> 42:57.678
The conviction
is set aside.

42:57.711 --> 42:58.979
You can go.

43:09.690 --> 43:13.059
Jimmy, thank you.
Thank you.

43:13.093 --> 43:14.728
Oh, God.

43:14.761 --> 43:17.030
Oh, we did it.

43:17.063 --> 43:19.132
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

43:19.165 --> 43:20.701
Thank you.

44:04.978 --> 44:07.380
(music playing)

44:31.171 --> 44:32.238
You stinker!
