WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:03.425
BOOTH: <i> Okay, here we go.</i>
<i>Christine's first report card.</i>

00:03.525 --> 00:05.378
<i>Lay it on me.</i>
BRENNAN: <i>In math,</i>

00:05.478 --> 00:08.513
her teacher gave
her an E-plus.

00:08.548 --> 00:10.148
Wait a second,
I don't know what that means.

00:10.183 --> 00:11.549
It's, like, one step up
from an "F."

00:11.584 --> 00:12.750
That's bad.

00:12.786 --> 00:14.418
No, "E," in this case,
stands for "exemplary."

00:14.454 --> 00:16.354
It's the highest
possible grade.

00:16.389 --> 00:19.724
Of course it does.
And it's E-plus, too, huh?

00:19.759 --> 00:21.759
She also got an E-plus
in physical education.

00:21.795 --> 00:23.394
That is something
I never achieved.

00:23.429 --> 00:24.695
Lightning-quick reflexes.

00:24.731 --> 00:26.864
Just like her dad, huh?

00:26.900 --> 00:28.099
Fast like a flea.

00:28.134 --> 00:29.834
Aw, you remembered.
Yeah, okay.

00:29.869 --> 00:31.169
What about spelling?
I was horrible at spelling.

00:31.204 --> 00:32.537
Thank God for computers,
'cause I, you know,

00:32.572 --> 00:33.638
I couldn't even spell
the word "spelling."

00:33.673 --> 00:35.506
Well, that's
just sad, Booth.

00:35.542 --> 00:36.707
That's a joke.

00:36.743 --> 00:38.342
Okay? Come on, what'd she get?

00:38.378 --> 00:39.911
E-plus.

00:39.946 --> 00:41.245
E-plus!

00:41.281 --> 00:42.947
Actually, she got perfect
grades across the board.

00:42.982 --> 00:44.549
This calls for a celebration.
(phone beeps)

00:44.584 --> 00:46.751
Taking her out for
ice cream after dinner.

00:46.786 --> 00:48.486
What is it?
A body was found in the Potomac.

00:48.521 --> 00:50.721
It's being brought to the lab.
Well, that's not good,

00:50.757 --> 00:52.423
because that means
the local PD moved the victim

00:52.458 --> 00:54.725
from the crime scene, and I know
how much you hate that.

00:54.761 --> 00:56.127
I do.

00:56.162 --> 00:59.430
However, I'm not going to
allow this minor irritation

00:59.465 --> 01:01.599
to get in the way
of my excellent mood.

01:01.634 --> 01:05.036
I mean, our daughter
is a genius.

01:06.105 --> 01:07.672
E-plus.

01:10.944 --> 01:13.177
Two frat guys from Georgetown

01:13.213 --> 01:15.613
found the body while
attempting a polar bear plunge

01:15.648 --> 01:17.048
in the Potomac.

01:17.083 --> 01:18.549
From what I can see
of the remaining tissue,

01:18.585 --> 01:20.785
the victim was
a Caucasian male.

01:20.820 --> 01:22.753
Big, too, at least
six feet tall.

01:22.789 --> 01:24.755
Yeah, well, the
facial reconstruction

01:24.791 --> 01:27.225
is gonna be a bit tough
without the mandible.

01:27.260 --> 01:30.728
Whoa-ho-ho, nice bracelet.

01:30.763 --> 01:32.530
I'm not sure who's got
more ice on them,

01:32.565 --> 01:33.831
you or the victim.

01:33.867 --> 01:35.867
Uh, the victim, obviously.

01:35.902 --> 01:37.535
HODGINS: You like it?
I got it for Angie

01:37.570 --> 01:39.203
as a desperate attempt
to apologize

01:39.239 --> 01:40.972
for what a jerk
I've been recently.

01:41.007 --> 01:42.540
It wasn't necessary.

01:42.575 --> 01:44.675
You've... you've been through a lot.
I know,

01:44.711 --> 01:46.911
but I just want you to know

01:46.946 --> 01:48.279
that I'm trying and...

01:48.314 --> 01:49.547
and I love you very much.

01:49.582 --> 01:51.749
Okay, enough of
the lovey-dovey.

01:51.784 --> 01:53.251
Honestly, I found you guys
more bearable

01:53.286 --> 01:54.952
when you were unbearable.

01:54.988 --> 01:56.487
SAROYAN:
Well, I for one,

01:56.522 --> 01:58.623
am glad to see you more like
your old self again.

01:58.658 --> 02:01.092
Now it's just Dr. Brennan's mood
I have to worry about.

02:01.127 --> 02:03.461
MONTENEGRO: Yeah, uh, there's no
way she can do an examination

02:03.496 --> 02:05.596
on a human Popsicle.

02:05.632 --> 02:07.131
WELLS:
According to my calculations,

02:07.166 --> 02:09.767
at room temperature,
without forced convection,

02:09.801 --> 02:11.335
it should take approximately

02:11.371 --> 02:14.305
eight hours and 33 minutes
for the ice to melt.

02:14.340 --> 02:16.474
Brennan's not gonna
want to wait that long.

02:16.509 --> 02:19.777
Actually, I think
I have an idea.

02:23.349 --> 02:24.682
So what are you thinking?

02:24.717 --> 02:26.217
Homicide?
Accidental drowning? Suicide?

02:26.252 --> 02:27.518
Well, we don't know, Aubrey,

02:27.553 --> 02:29.654
till we get stuff back
from the lab, right?

02:29.689 --> 02:30.689
Here are the pictures.

02:30.723 --> 02:32.189
Ah, there you are.
Finally.

02:32.225 --> 02:33.225
Hello.
(chuckles)

02:33.259 --> 02:34.358
Karen, great.
Yeah.

02:34.394 --> 02:35.626
Okay, what are you doing here?

02:35.662 --> 02:37.094
Does the BRIU have
an interest in the case?

02:37.130 --> 02:38.195
Oh, no, uh, actually,

02:38.231 --> 02:40.031
I don't know what case
you're referring to,

02:40.066 --> 02:41.666
but if you need my help.

02:41.701 --> 02:44.869
No, actually, you know, it's
probably just a suicide, so...

02:44.904 --> 02:46.070
Oh, really?

02:46.105 --> 02:48.339
'Cause given the weather,
I don't think so.

02:48.374 --> 02:50.207
She doesn't think so.
Obviously.

02:50.243 --> 02:54.145
No, see, suicide by drowning
decreases 72% in cold weather.

02:54.180 --> 02:55.680
Behaviorally, we can't
control our reflex

02:55.715 --> 02:57.281
to get out of icy water.

02:57.317 --> 02:59.417
Unless you jump off the bridge,
and then you really don't

02:59.452 --> 03:00.785
have a choice of getting out.

03:00.820 --> 03:03.020
Which bridge?
AUBREY: Body was found in Rock Creek;

03:03.056 --> 03:04.889
nearest bridge is
Theodore Roosevelt.

03:04.924 --> 03:06.557
Oh, no.

03:06.592 --> 03:08.259
See, the bridge of
choice for jumpers

03:08.294 --> 03:11.028
is either the Duke Ellington
or the George Washington.

03:11.064 --> 03:12.129
Besides, I mean,

03:12.165 --> 03:13.397
look at this body.

03:13.433 --> 03:14.632
Our victim's wearing a suit.

03:14.667 --> 03:15.967
Looks nice, put together.

03:16.002 --> 03:17.668
Nope. I think you've
got a body dump.

03:17.704 --> 03:18.970
BOOTH:
Okay, so that's great.

03:19.005 --> 03:20.304
Thank you very much
for coming in.

03:20.340 --> 03:22.173
If you don't have anything else
about the case, you can...

03:22.208 --> 03:23.174
Oh, no, actually,

03:23.209 --> 03:24.675
I-I came to see Agent Aubrey.

03:24.711 --> 03:25.876
He's right here.

03:25.912 --> 03:27.812
Me? Okay. What do you need?

03:27.847 --> 03:29.947
Well, I have not had
my morning coffee yet,

03:29.983 --> 03:32.183
and I thought maybe you
and I could go get some.

03:32.218 --> 03:33.250
Together.

03:33.286 --> 03:34.286
I already have coffee.

03:34.320 --> 03:38.155
Well, maybe,
um, a rain check.

03:38.191 --> 03:39.423
Tonight?

03:39.459 --> 03:41.425
Excuse me?

03:41.461 --> 03:44.061
(quietly):
She's asking you out on a date.

03:44.097 --> 03:45.629
Mm-hmm. What do you say?

03:45.665 --> 03:47.531
Oh.
(clears throat)

03:47.567 --> 03:49.667
I'm sorry, what?

03:54.640 --> 03:56.574
What we've done is
we've hooked these vents up

03:56.609 --> 03:58.109
to a metallurgical
blast furnace.

03:58.144 --> 03:59.543
I happened to have
one lying around

03:59.579 --> 04:01.012
from a previous experiment.

04:01.047 --> 04:02.480
Is this the same furnace
that almost

04:02.515 --> 04:03.647
burned down the lab last year?

04:03.683 --> 04:06.817
Uh, different circumstances,
but yes.

04:06.853 --> 04:08.285
I call her Smaug,

04:08.321 --> 04:10.187
because this baby breathes fire.

04:10.223 --> 04:11.522
WELLS:
According to my calculations,

04:11.557 --> 04:13.190
it should take approximately

04:13.226 --> 04:15.192
15.2 seconds
for the ice to melt.

04:15.228 --> 04:17.394
What about the water
and particulate evidence?

04:17.430 --> 04:19.329
Yeah, there's
a 400-gallon basin

04:19.365 --> 04:21.432
below the grates that's
catching every last drop.

04:21.466 --> 04:23.634
Proceed.

04:26.305 --> 04:27.772
T minus three.

04:27.807 --> 04:29.006
Two.

04:29.042 --> 04:30.307
One.

04:30.977 --> 04:32.476
(fire roaring)

04:36.983 --> 04:38.215
It's working!

04:38.251 --> 04:41.552
Applied science is
a beautiful, beautiful thing!

that is excellent work.

05:05.111 --> 05:06.610
Ooh.

05:06.646 --> 05:08.446
Well done, Dr. Hodgins.

05:08.481 --> 05:10.815

It's like
you're rootering

05:53.323 --> 05:55.290
a pair of lungs.
Yeah.

05:55.325 --> 05:58.293
The interesting thing is,
I'm not seeing any river water.

05:58.328 --> 06:00.061
No dinoflagellates
or micro-algae

06:00.097 --> 06:01.496
in any of this lung tissue.

06:01.531 --> 06:03.231
Well, that means, then,

06:03.266 --> 06:05.133
that that behavioral
analyst was right,

06:05.168 --> 06:07.302
that this was a body dump.

06:07.337 --> 06:09.904
So I'm guess things are

Well, it's totally me,
so no complaining.

06:17.781 --> 06:20.682
Yeah, I appreciate
that he's trying.

06:20.717 --> 06:23.818
It's just, it's not
like it was before.

06:23.854 --> 06:25.353
We're not...

06:25.388 --> 06:26.888
intimate.

06:26.923 --> 06:28.957
Give it time.

06:28.992 --> 06:31.860
I'm sure he'll engage with you
when he's ready.

06:31.895 --> 06:34.329
And you'll be right there
when he does.

06:34.364 --> 06:36.231
Thanks.

06:36.266 --> 06:38.266
Oh.

06:38.301 --> 06:40.835
Oh, hey, what about...
what about her?

06:40.871 --> 06:42.170
Her?

06:42.205 --> 06:43.404
Yeah, for an I.D.

06:43.440 --> 06:45.173
I mean, if a guy gets

06:45.208 --> 06:47.208
a tattoo of a woman's face
on his arm,

06:47.244 --> 06:48.843
then she probably meant
something to him, right?

06:48.879 --> 06:50.979
You want to run your facial
recognition software

06:51.014 --> 06:52.213
on the tattoo?

06:52.249 --> 06:53.281
If we can find her,

06:53.316 --> 06:55.717
then maybe she can
give us an I.D.

06:57.187 --> 06:59.320
BOOTH:
<i>Okay, so when's the big date?</i>

06:59.356 --> 07:01.222
There's not gonna
be any date.

07:01.258 --> 07:02.690
Mm, that's not
what I heard.

07:02.726 --> 07:04.192
I heard you say "yes."

07:04.227 --> 07:06.961
What was I supposed to say?
She blindsided me.

07:06.997 --> 07:09.531
Who the hell asks someone out
in front of another person?

07:09.566 --> 07:11.900
Well, you know, shrinks tend
to be a little bit crazy.

07:11.935 --> 07:14.369
And you know what they say
about the crazy ones in bed.

07:14.404 --> 07:16.337
No.
(phone beeps)

07:16.373 --> 07:17.839
Look, things are going great
with me and Jessica.

07:17.874 --> 07:19.541
I don't want to
mess that up.

07:19.576 --> 07:21.376
You got something?
Yeah.

07:21.411 --> 07:23.511
Angela's sending me, uh, an I.D.
of the tattoo of this lady,

07:23.547 --> 07:25.847
Lissa Bowman,
Bethesda, Maryland.

07:25.882 --> 07:27.882
Lissa Bowman-- why does
that name sound familiar?

07:27.918 --> 07:28.782
Huh, maybe you had
coffee with her.

07:28.806 --> 07:29.518
Ooh.

07:29.519 --> 07:31.019
You're good, you know that?
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

07:31.054 --> 07:32.454
All right, you mind
taking that one?

07:32.489 --> 07:34.656
I'm gonna go, uh, sort out
this date thing with Karen.

07:34.691 --> 07:35.924
No problem.

07:35.959 --> 07:37.492
You better nip this
in the bud, huh?

07:37.527 --> 07:40.562
Because, before you know it,
coffee turns into lunch,

07:40.597 --> 07:42.363
and then lunch into dinner,

07:42.399 --> 07:47.735
and then the candles
are burning low all night long.

07:50.907 --> 07:53.808
LISSA:
Yeah, it's got to be Frankie.

07:53.844 --> 07:56.544
He got that tattoo
when we were

07:56.580 --> 07:58.613
vacationing down in
South Beach one year.

07:58.648 --> 08:00.982
That's also where I was born.
Really?

08:01.017 --> 08:02.817
So when did you first notice
your husband went missing?

08:02.853 --> 08:04.052
A week ago.

08:04.087 --> 08:05.253
I didn't really
think much of it,

08:05.288 --> 08:06.554
'cause he's often
out of town for work.

08:06.590 --> 08:08.523
Mm-hmm. And what kind
of work did he do?

08:08.558 --> 08:10.725
Frankie was what you
would call a fixer.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.660
And his clients were
nothing but top-shelf.

08:12.696 --> 08:14.762
Politicians and CEOs,
athletes.

08:14.798 --> 08:16.998
He even had a handful
of movie stars.

08:17.033 --> 08:18.566
Right, okay.

08:18.602 --> 08:21.069
So his job was to use
whatever means necessary

08:21.104 --> 08:24.572
to make sure his client's
problems went away.

08:24.608 --> 08:26.708
Frankie always tried to keep me
safe by not telling me

08:26.743 --> 08:27.942
too much about
what he was doing.

08:27.978 --> 08:29.978
I just wish
Frankie had

08:30.013 --> 08:32.145
taken such good care of himself.

08:32.182 --> 08:33.847
I'm gonna need to talk
to somebody at his work.

08:33.884 --> 08:34.884
You should talk to Kerry,

08:34.918 --> 08:35.984
his assistant.

08:36.019 --> 08:37.284
I'll get you her number.

08:37.320 --> 08:38.453
Right.
(clears throat)

08:38.488 --> 08:39.654
Here you go.

08:39.688 --> 08:41.422
Agent Booth,

08:41.457 --> 08:44.459
you find who did this,
you hear me?

08:44.494 --> 08:47.795
You find them,
and you make them pay.

08:52.669 --> 08:53.835
Dr. Brennan.

08:53.870 --> 08:55.303
In examining the cleaned skull,

08:55.338 --> 08:56.905
I identified some perimortem
stellate fractures

08:56.940 --> 08:59.641
to the alveolar process,
the maxilla

08:59.676 --> 09:00.808
and the inferior nasal conchae.

09:00.844 --> 09:02.110
Fractures which
are indicative

09:02.145 --> 09:03.177
of blunt force trauma.

09:03.213 --> 09:04.412
I believe cause of death

09:04.447 --> 09:06.648
was due to
intracerebral hemorrhage.

09:06.683 --> 09:07.815
I concur.

09:07.851 --> 09:09.117
Good work.

09:09.152 --> 09:11.619
I see your daughter
did well.

09:11.655 --> 09:13.288
Oh, yes.

09:13.323 --> 09:15.056
We're very proud of her.

09:15.091 --> 09:17.125
I, too, received nothing
but top marks at her age,

09:17.160 --> 09:18.192
in every subject matter.

09:18.228 --> 09:20.395
Of course,
standards were much higher

09:20.430 --> 09:22.330
when I was in first grade.

09:22.365 --> 09:25.566
A point of fact, I actually was
exemplary in all my subjects.

09:25.602 --> 09:28.536
What do you mean
"standards were higher"?

09:28.571 --> 09:30.905
Well, take this E-plus
Christine received in Art.

09:30.941 --> 09:32.573
Look at that drawing.

09:32.609 --> 09:34.509
The lines jitter.
The color palette

09:34.544 --> 09:36.711
is either primary
or mud brown.

09:36.746 --> 09:38.546
She hardly applied
any shadowing techniques at all,

09:38.581 --> 09:40.548
which I certainly
did at her age.

09:40.583 --> 09:42.717
Objectively speaking,
I'd have to give her work

09:42.752 --> 09:44.619
a "G," for good.

09:44.654 --> 09:45.920
At best.

09:45.956 --> 09:47.555
Are you criticizing
my daughter's art?

09:47.590 --> 09:48.690
And her math skills.

09:48.725 --> 09:50.224
I mean, look at
that stick figure,

09:50.260 --> 09:52.126
which I can only
presume is you.

09:52.162 --> 09:53.728
It has 14 fingers.

09:53.763 --> 09:55.797
And while polydactylism
is a real thing,

09:55.832 --> 09:58.232
I hardly think it applies here.

09:58.268 --> 09:59.901
Dr. Wells, you can go,

09:59.936 --> 10:03.204
and have Dr. Hodgins swab
the skull for particulates.

10:03.239 --> 10:05.640
Oh, I already did that
before I came in here.

10:05.675 --> 10:07.175
But that shouldn't surprise you.

10:07.210 --> 10:11.212
After all,
I am exemplary in all my work.

10:17.587 --> 10:19.687
AUBREY:
<i>So, listen, about the whole</i>

10:19.723 --> 10:21.889
coffee thing this morning,
you know, my apologies.

10:21.925 --> 10:23.358
I-I misunderstood.

10:23.393 --> 10:25.793
The truth is, I'm...
I'm seeing someone.

10:25.829 --> 10:28.162
No, I totally get it.
It's fine.

10:28.198 --> 10:30.264
So no... no hard feelings?
No.

10:30.300 --> 10:32.100
It's intriguing, but...

10:32.135 --> 10:33.868
No, no hard feelings.

10:33.903 --> 10:35.069
Wait, what's intriguing?

10:35.105 --> 10:37.005
So you said
that you knew the victim,

10:37.040 --> 10:38.106
Frank Kwiatowski?

10:38.141 --> 10:39.907
What? Yeah.
No, sort of.

10:39.943 --> 10:42.610
Uh, my-my father used his
services back in the day.

10:42.645 --> 10:43.811
Ah, that's right.

10:43.847 --> 10:45.947
Benjamin Aubrey, financier.

10:45.982 --> 10:48.216
Arrested for running a
multimillion-dollar Ponzi scheme

10:48.251 --> 10:51.052
and then running off to Croatia
instead of facing charges.

10:51.087 --> 10:52.487
(whistles) I see you
did your homework.

10:52.522 --> 10:54.789
Well, it's just, I like to know
who I'm going out with,

10:54.824 --> 10:56.591
or not going out with
as the case may be.

10:56.626 --> 10:58.426
You must have some
profound daddy issues.

10:58.461 --> 11:01.529
So why did your father
hire Kwiatowski?

11:01.564 --> 11:03.464
You know, honestly, my father
never really talked to me

11:03.500 --> 11:04.932
about his business, okay?

11:04.968 --> 11:07.168
He just let me tag
along sometimes.

11:07.203 --> 11:08.870
Fascinating.

11:08.905 --> 11:10.471
Your daddy issues, I mean.

11:10.507 --> 11:13.107
It explains why
you're such a pleaser.

11:13.143 --> 11:15.209
Why you say yes to things
that you don't need or want,

11:15.245 --> 11:16.210
like coffee.

11:16.246 --> 11:17.779
Have you ever seen a therapist?

11:17.814 --> 11:20.248
You know, I think I could be
of real help to you.

11:20.283 --> 11:22.483
(exhales)

11:22.519 --> 11:25.119
I'm gonna take that as a no.

11:31.194 --> 11:34.996
Look, we deal in delicate
matters, but to be honest,

11:35.031 --> 11:37.565
I can't think of anyone who had
the balls to mess with Frank.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.267
He could be intimidating.

11:39.302 --> 11:40.835
Did you guys, uh,
remodel recently?

11:40.870 --> 11:42.937
No. Maybe, like,
five years ago. Why?

11:42.972 --> 11:44.305
No reason. I just...

11:44.340 --> 11:47.375
I used to come here
a lo... long time ago.

11:47.410 --> 11:48.810
I see you've expanded.

11:48.845 --> 11:51.379
A conference room,
second office.

11:51.414 --> 11:53.181
Oh, so business is good.

11:53.216 --> 11:55.149
Frank was outstanding at his job.
Oh.

11:55.185 --> 11:57.318
How was he as a boss?
Good enough.

11:57.353 --> 11:58.486
Well, then I'm curious
why you waited

11:58.521 --> 11:59.854
a week to report
him missing.

11:59.889 --> 12:01.856
Because I was
in Atlanta working.

12:01.891 --> 12:03.691
Look, I'm telling you,
if you want them,

12:03.726 --> 12:05.359
I've got car rental
and hotel receipts.

12:05.395 --> 12:06.795
Not to mention
a dozen eyewitnesses.

12:06.830 --> 12:08.329
Well, speaking
of paperwork,

12:08.364 --> 12:10.798
I'm gonna need copies of
all of Frank's case files,

12:10.834 --> 12:12.033
including his computers.

12:12.068 --> 12:13.167
Be my guest.

12:13.203 --> 12:14.569
Go at it.

12:16.906 --> 12:18.873
(clears throat)

12:22.345 --> 12:24.078
(laughs)

12:24.114 --> 12:26.581
Okay, come on, Kerry.

12:26.616 --> 12:28.983
You and I both know that those
aren't the real files.

12:29.018 --> 12:30.418
I don't know
what you're talking about.

12:30.453 --> 12:31.619
You know, as a kid,

12:31.654 --> 12:34.322
growing up,
I was pretty curious.

12:34.357 --> 12:36.324
Tended to snoop
around a lot.

12:36.359 --> 12:38.226
In fact,

12:38.261 --> 12:40.194
that's probably
why I became a cop.

12:40.230 --> 12:42.563
Oh, no, I think you became a cop
because your father's

12:42.599 --> 12:45.600
a pathological liar and
it made you question everything.

12:45.635 --> 12:48.369
Or that's one opinion.

12:48.404 --> 12:49.804
Anyway,

12:49.839 --> 12:53.207
as I was saying,
I tended to snoop around a lot,

12:53.243 --> 12:56.210
especially when I had
to entertain myself

12:56.246 --> 12:59.547
because my father
was too busy for me.

12:59.582 --> 13:03.317
That's how I know
that mirror is a two-way.

13:03.353 --> 13:06.787
There's a hidden camera
in that lamp.

13:06.823 --> 13:08.789
And...

13:08.825 --> 13:11.259
while a lot of these
fixtures have changed--

13:11.294 --> 13:14.362
new sink, new faucet--

13:14.397 --> 13:18.432
there's still one thing
that hasn't changed.

13:27.343 --> 13:28.609
Where your boss hides

13:28.645 --> 13:31.412
all of his most
important files.

13:35.767 --> 13:38.270
Hey. I finished my analysis

13:38.275 --> 13:40.175
of the trace
found in the skull wound.

13:40.205 --> 13:42.306
I found particulates
of northern white ash.

13:42.341 --> 13:44.675
So the blunt force object

13:44.710 --> 13:47.644
that bludgeoned the victim
in the face is made of wood.

13:47.680 --> 13:49.579
Dr. Brennan, I found distinct

13:49.615 --> 13:51.782
remodeling on the lateral
surface of the victim's

13:51.817 --> 13:53.250
left proximal tibia.

13:53.285 --> 13:54.418
This damage appears

13:54.453 --> 13:57.788
to have been inflicted
approximately one year ago.

13:57.823 --> 14:00.257
I'll inform Booth so he can
check hospital records.

14:00.292 --> 14:01.692
HODGINS:
Hey, by the way,

14:01.727 --> 14:04.061
I looked at the e-mail
of the photo you sent me

14:04.096 --> 14:06.296
of your niece's art grade,
but without the original, I...

14:06.332 --> 14:07.631
Wh-What are you doing?

14:07.666 --> 14:09.900
Excuse me.
What photo are you referring to?

14:09.935 --> 14:11.969
Uh, nothing?

14:14.840 --> 14:16.340
Or maybe not.

14:16.375 --> 14:18.408
It's-it's not a big deal.

14:18.444 --> 14:20.410
I mean, Oliver,
he just, he asked me

14:20.446 --> 14:22.846
to examine a jpeg of
his niece's report card.

14:22.881 --> 14:25.248
Your niece's report card?

14:25.284 --> 14:26.249
HODGINS:
So Oliver was

14:26.285 --> 14:27.918
under suspicion
that the little tyke

14:27.953 --> 14:30.921
actually changed
a minus sign into a plus,

14:30.956 --> 14:34.124
in order to dupe
her simpleton parents.

14:34.159 --> 14:35.525
I take it

14:35.561 --> 14:38.195
that you proved
Dr. Wells'

14:38.230 --> 14:40.297
suspicions to be
misguided at best.

14:40.332 --> 14:41.698
Uh, no, actually,

14:41.734 --> 14:43.633
it looks like that's
exactly what she did.

14:43.669 --> 14:45.202
I mean, it's impossible
to determine

14:45.237 --> 14:46.903
without further analysis,

14:46.939 --> 14:48.538
but based on the shade
and the thickness

14:48.574 --> 14:50.273
of the actual stroke,

14:50.309 --> 14:52.943
I mean, I would say that
two different pens were used.

14:52.978 --> 14:54.511
Anyway, as you can see,
no big deal.

14:54.546 --> 14:57.881
Just doing a little
favor here for a friend.

15:00.953 --> 15:03.053
Dr. Brennan,
let me explain.

15:03.088 --> 15:04.221
After our last talk,

15:04.256 --> 15:05.822
I felt I had been
overly critical,

15:05.858 --> 15:08.392
so I came to your office
to apologize,

15:08.427 --> 15:10.494
and that's when I noticed
the inconsistency.

15:10.529 --> 15:12.562
Of course, to my credit,
my hunch was correct.

15:12.598 --> 15:14.698
My daughter did not cheat.

15:14.733 --> 15:16.400
Well, evidence would
say otherwise.

15:16.435 --> 15:18.201
I thought, as
a scientist,

15:18.237 --> 15:20.237
you would want
to know the truth.

15:26.311 --> 15:29.479
Wow, are you guys finding
as much dirt as I am here?

15:29.515 --> 15:32.482
Uh, yeah, great big
heaping mounds of it.

15:32.518 --> 15:34.151
I am looking
at a wiretap transcript

15:34.186 --> 15:36.286
of a Ukrainian ambassador
who was moonlighting

15:36.321 --> 15:38.288
as a... as a arms dealer.
Ooh.

15:38.323 --> 15:40.023
That's nothing. I mean,
I've got a lobbyist

15:40.059 --> 15:42.692
who paid our victim to blackmail
a prep school headmaster

15:42.728 --> 15:44.895
so his doofus son
could get in.

15:44.930 --> 15:46.129
Huh. Uh-oh.

15:46.165 --> 15:46.997
You find something?

15:47.032 --> 15:48.865
Yes and no.

15:48.901 --> 15:51.068
What do you got?
It's your father's file.

15:51.103 --> 15:54.771
I mean, you should be
the one to open it.

15:54.807 --> 15:56.139
AUBREY:
No.

15:56.175 --> 15:58.341
My father has
no relevance to the case.

15:58.377 --> 16:00.310
He's been out of the country
for 18 years.

16:00.345 --> 16:02.546
It would be unethical
for me to read it.

16:02.581 --> 16:04.281
But aren't you
the least bit curious?

16:04.316 --> 16:06.216
Not at all.
(phone beeps)

16:06.251 --> 16:07.084
Whoa, wait a second.

16:07.119 --> 16:08.718
Hold up, guys.
Look, the lab found

16:08.754 --> 16:11.021
evidence that our victim's left
leg was shattered a year ago.

16:11.056 --> 16:13.557
Wait, shattered, like a
car accident shattered?

16:13.592 --> 16:15.158
They're saying
it was a blunt force,

16:15.194 --> 16:18.495
so it would be
a bat or a pipe.

16:18.530 --> 16:20.697
Okay, I'm sorry,
but are we just gonna breeze

16:20.732 --> 16:22.065
right by your father's file?

16:22.101 --> 16:24.034
Is that what we're doing here?
We're working.

16:24.069 --> 16:25.702
Okay, Karen?
Yeah, I know.

16:25.737 --> 16:27.504
Just, sitting on a trove
of paternal secrets

16:27.539 --> 16:29.639
while working is-- I'm just
gonna throw it out there--

16:29.675 --> 16:32.409
odd, but carry on.

16:32.444 --> 16:33.577
Thank you.

16:33.612 --> 16:35.045
So maybe the person
who shattered Frank's leg

16:35.080 --> 16:36.313
came back to finish
the job, right?

16:36.348 --> 16:38.415
That doesn't make sense.
Why would the killer

16:38.450 --> 16:40.083
wait a whole year?
Whoa, look at this.

16:40.119 --> 16:41.451
Frank worked for this woman

16:41.487 --> 16:43.587
who was divorcing
a low-life nightclub owner

16:43.622 --> 16:44.721
named Jimmy Nasari.

16:44.756 --> 16:45.922
AUBREY:
Nasari, yeah.

16:45.958 --> 16:46.923
I know this guy.

16:46.959 --> 16:48.425
He's a mid-level
wannabe mobster.

16:48.460 --> 16:50.527
He's been trying to make a
name for himself for years.

16:50.562 --> 16:51.828
Right, Jimmy's go-to move

16:51.864 --> 16:54.264
was, uh, breaking a man's legs
with his signature bat.

16:54.299 --> 16:56.600
That makes sense,
especially as the wood found

16:56.635 --> 16:58.401
in the victim's face
was white ash.

16:58.437 --> 17:00.770
DELFS: Whoa, look
what I found. Okay.

17:00.806 --> 17:02.305
Nasari had a payout to his wife.

17:02.341 --> 17:06.276
It was court ordered last week
for $12 million.

17:06.310 --> 17:08.310
All thanks to the work
of our victim.

17:09.515 --> 17:10.515
BOOTH:
<i>Wait a second.</i>

17:10.549 --> 17:12.015
<i>You're saying that that squint</i>

17:12.050 --> 17:13.617
accused Christine
of cheating? Who?

17:13.652 --> 17:15.819
Dr. Wells.
Dr. Wells?

17:15.854 --> 17:17.654
That goofy tall guy
who no one likes?

17:17.689 --> 17:21.758
Dr. Wells had Hodgins examine
a photo of the grade.

17:21.792 --> 17:22.992
Hodgins is in on this?

17:23.028 --> 17:25.095
Well, he didn't know
what he was testing,

17:25.130 --> 17:28.298
but his analysis
suggests that a minus sign

17:28.333 --> 17:30.300
was changed into a plus.

17:30.335 --> 17:33.203
That can't be right.
I mean, Christine wouldn't...

17:33.238 --> 17:35.505
What subject was it for?
Art.

17:35.541 --> 17:36.940
Booth,

17:36.975 --> 17:39.376
Christine did not forge
a school document

17:39.411 --> 17:40.777
for the sake of a grade.

17:40.812 --> 17:41.978
Of course she didn't.

17:42.014 --> 17:43.713
It's ludicrous.
Absolutely.

17:43.749 --> 17:46.183
Our daughter is not
capable of such fraud.

17:46.218 --> 17:48.118
Well, she's six years old.
It's impossible.

17:48.153 --> 17:49.886
Of course not. Really?

17:52.090 --> 17:54.824
Don't know who you're talking
about. I never met the guy.

17:54.860 --> 17:56.293
BOOTH: All right,
I asked you one question.

17:56.328 --> 17:58.328
I already have you on
obstruction of justice.

17:58.363 --> 18:01.231
Look at the picture
again and think.

18:01.266 --> 18:02.666
Yeah, all right, fine,
I knew the guy.

18:02.701 --> 18:05.268
But I didn't kill him.
What, do I look stupid to you?

18:05.304 --> 18:07.537
Your pronounced browridge is
suggestive of Neanderthal man,

18:07.573 --> 18:09.172
so yes.

18:09.208 --> 18:10.740
You're kidding me, right?
Get the hell out of here.

18:10.776 --> 18:11.841
BOOTH: This is what
I'm not understanding.

18:11.877 --> 18:13.009
Help me out here.

18:13.045 --> 18:15.078
Why is it that after
you break Frank's legs,

18:15.113 --> 18:16.746
he doesn't go to the cops?

18:16.782 --> 18:18.114
Perhaps he doesn't press charges
because you threatened

18:18.150 --> 18:19.182
to kill him if he ever talked?

18:19.218 --> 18:21.084
Yeah, right.
I wish that's what he did.

18:21.119 --> 18:22.452
I don't understand.

18:22.487 --> 18:23.753
Why would you want him
to press charges?

18:23.789 --> 18:24.955
Look, Frank Kwiatowski is

18:24.990 --> 18:26.823
no angel, all right?
Instead of shutting the hell up

18:26.858 --> 18:28.692
or going to the cops,
you know what he did?

18:28.727 --> 18:30.527
He waged an all-out war
against me.

18:30.562 --> 18:32.195
Well, what exactly did he do?
What didn't he do?

18:32.231 --> 18:33.997
He used his local cop contacts
to shut down

18:34.032 --> 18:35.966
half my clubs
on some zoning violation.

18:36.001 --> 18:37.834
And then he goes
to see my mother,

18:37.869 --> 18:40.470
who's got Alzheimer's disease,
starts gas-lighting her,

18:40.505 --> 18:41.638
telling her things
like I can't afford

18:41.673 --> 18:43.139
to keep her in a
nice home anymore.

18:43.175 --> 18:45.375
And then my kid
gets expelled from St. Malo's

18:45.410 --> 18:47.577
for having dope on him,
which I know Frank planted.

18:47.613 --> 18:49.546
You want me to keep going?

18:49.581 --> 18:52.282
So you admit you have
multiple motives to kill.

18:52.317 --> 18:55.418
I didn't do it, all right?

18:55.454 --> 18:57.721
You were scared of him.

18:57.756 --> 19:00.490
I'm not scared of anyone,
you hear me?

19:00.525 --> 19:02.092
All right, look, I need to know
your whereabouts last week.

19:02.127 --> 19:05.929
That's easy. I was down at
the shore at one of my hotels.

19:07.332 --> 19:09.666
Hey, I found
fresh duck feces

19:09.701 --> 19:11.434
on the tread of
the victim's shoe.

19:11.470 --> 19:12.802
I trust

19:12.838 --> 19:14.037
you're telling me
this for a reason,

19:14.072 --> 19:15.538
other than to make
me say "yuck."

19:15.574 --> 19:17.841
So the feces belonged
to the greater scaup, uh,

19:17.876 --> 19:20.043
which is found only in a
few places in the D.C. area.

19:20.078 --> 19:21.645
The first one is
Anacostia Park.

19:21.680 --> 19:24.014
Second one is the
tidal basin, which is

19:24.049 --> 19:25.649
near the FDR Memorial.

19:25.684 --> 19:29.319
And then third:
Roaches Run Waterfowl Sanctuary.

19:29.354 --> 19:31.154
Which means
the victim was at

19:31.189 --> 19:33.056
one of those places at
or near time of death.

19:33.091 --> 19:34.591
Good work.

19:34.626 --> 19:36.960
How's my beautiful
and talented wife coming along

19:36.995 --> 19:38.328
with the victim's computer?

19:38.363 --> 19:39.763
MONTENEGRO:
Not great.

19:39.798 --> 19:42.065
Frank encrypted his files,
so I'm using

19:42.100 --> 19:44.934
counter-steganography to see
if I can gain access to it.

19:44.970 --> 19:46.002
Let me know when you're done.

19:46.038 --> 19:47.904
Yeah.

19:50.242 --> 19:52.409
Uh, Angie.
Yeah?

19:52.444 --> 19:53.977
I have something for you.

19:54.012 --> 19:55.145
Oh.

19:55.180 --> 19:56.746
So the bracelet looked

19:56.782 --> 20:00.550
so good on you
that I thought I should

20:00.585 --> 20:03.420
get you something
to go along with it.

20:05.257 --> 20:06.656
Oh, my God.

20:06.692 --> 20:09.225
Wow.

20:09.261 --> 20:11.961
Gosh, that's really
so beautiful,

20:11.997 --> 20:13.330
but, um, this is too much.

20:13.365 --> 20:14.998
I don't... I don't need
any gifts.

20:15.033 --> 20:17.334
No, uh, take it, Angie.

20:17.369 --> 20:19.803
I mean, look,
I-I was really terrible to you,

20:19.838 --> 20:22.672
and you deserve this,
so go ahead and-and try that on.

20:22.708 --> 20:24.774
It's-it's very sweet,

20:24.810 --> 20:26.710
and, uh, it's
a generous thought,

20:26.745 --> 20:27.911
but I don't...
I don't...

20:27.946 --> 20:30.380
Angela, please, just try it on.

20:35.487 --> 20:37.620
Okay.

20:46.498 --> 20:47.630
Wow.

20:47.666 --> 20:50.567
Yeah, it's-it's awesome.

20:50.602 --> 20:53.303
You look amazing.

20:53.338 --> 20:54.804
Awesome.

20:56.608 --> 20:59.609
So Hotel Victoria
in Atlantic City

20:59.644 --> 21:01.511
just confirmed
Jimmy Nasari's alibi.

21:01.546 --> 21:04.080
Don't worry, I think
I found something.

21:04.116 --> 21:05.782
(scoffs)
I'm not worried.

21:05.817 --> 21:07.751
Well, you're eating
a jelly doughnut

21:07.786 --> 21:09.185
in the middle
of the afternoon,

21:09.221 --> 21:11.221
and eating is your
coping mechanism, so...

21:11.256 --> 21:12.856
Or, yeah, maybe I'm just hungry.

21:12.891 --> 21:13.790
Oh, okay.

21:13.825 --> 21:15.692
Hey, speaking of
being in denial,

21:15.727 --> 21:17.394
I really think you should
read your father's file.

21:17.429 --> 21:20.163
Okay, have you read it?

21:20.198 --> 21:21.731
Yes.

21:21.767 --> 21:23.833
Is there anything in it
related to the case?

21:23.869 --> 21:26.202
No.

21:26.238 --> 21:27.270
Great.

21:27.305 --> 21:29.572
Then I'm not reading it.

21:29.608 --> 21:32.041
Your discipline is terrifying.

21:32.077 --> 21:33.777
Thank you.
What do you got?

21:33.812 --> 21:36.613
Okay, so this is a client
who has an office

21:36.648 --> 21:39.082
off of Anacostia Park,
which also happens to be

21:39.117 --> 21:42.218
where the greater scaup
duck congregates.

21:42.254 --> 21:43.486
Are you serious?

21:43.522 --> 21:44.954
Abraham Froome,
the CEO from,

21:44.990 --> 21:46.856
uh, Froome Tire Centers?

21:46.892 --> 21:49.726
Th-This guy's a billionaire
ten times over.

21:49.761 --> 21:51.728
Well, it seems like
Froome hired our victim

21:51.763 --> 21:54.864
to retrieve some sort
of blackmail sex tape.

21:54.900 --> 21:57.167
And then the
blackmailer also sent

21:57.202 --> 21:58.568
several still photographs

21:58.603 --> 22:00.804
as proof of
what he still possesses.

22:00.839 --> 22:01.805
Oh!

22:01.840 --> 22:04.374
Wow. Oh, man.

22:04.409 --> 22:07.043
Super rich really aren't
like the rest of us, are they?

22:07.078 --> 22:10.480
Well, it just seems like
Grandpa wanted his nuk-nuk.

22:14.159 --> 22:15.825
AUBREY: So let me get this
straight here, Mr. Froome.

22:15.861 --> 22:18.442
You hired Frank because
you were being blackmailed?

22:18.443 --> 22:19.375
Yes.

22:19.409 --> 22:21.473
Somehow someone made a video

22:21.573 --> 22:24.073
while I was staying
at the Hotel Poggio.

22:24.109 --> 22:26.543
The blackmailer sent me
an e-mail demanding

22:26.578 --> 22:28.511
I pay him $2 million.

22:28.547 --> 22:30.547
I asked Frank
to handle it for me.

22:30.582 --> 22:31.748
And then what happened?

22:31.783 --> 22:33.716
Well, at first,
Frank told me not to pay.

22:33.752 --> 22:36.953
He said he would take care
of retrieving the video.

22:36.988 --> 22:38.721
When he came back
several days later,

22:38.757 --> 22:41.658
h-he was badly beaten
about the face.

22:41.693 --> 22:42.926
DELFS:
So you're saying

22:42.961 --> 22:45.061
the blackmailer assaulted him.

22:45.096 --> 22:46.796
That's when Frank told me
I should pay,

22:46.831 --> 22:49.465
that this blackmailer
was insane,

22:49.501 --> 22:51.234
someone who would
not listen to reason.

22:51.269 --> 22:53.703
Last time I saw Frank
was to give him the money

22:53.738 --> 22:55.572
so that we could
pay this guy off.

22:55.607 --> 22:57.574
Wait, so are you telling me

22:57.609 --> 23:01.578
that Frank had $2 million
in cash on him

23:01.613 --> 23:03.246
the day that he died?

23:10.522 --> 23:12.422
Any luck tracking
down an I.P. address

23:12.457 --> 23:14.223
on that e-mail the
blackmailer sent?

23:14.259 --> 23:15.658
No, unfortunately,
it's a dead-end.

23:15.694 --> 23:17.627
He or she used
an overseas proxy,

23:17.662 --> 23:19.696
so there's no way
to trace it.

23:19.731 --> 23:21.998
What about the
still itself?

23:22.033 --> 23:24.367
You just can't get
enough of that, can you?

23:24.402 --> 23:25.768
What can I say?

23:25.804 --> 23:26.970
Fetishes are my fetish.

23:27.005 --> 23:28.304
Seriously, though,

23:28.340 --> 23:30.006
I just don't get it.
I know, right?

23:30.041 --> 23:32.008
I mean, if this guy
really wanted to be

23:32.043 --> 23:33.443
in diapers so badly,

23:33.478 --> 23:35.044
he should have just waited
a couple of years.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.046
(sighs)

23:37.082 --> 23:38.648
So, uh, what-what have you got?

23:38.683 --> 23:40.249
Okay, so to be honest,

23:40.285 --> 23:43.820
this is still a work
in progress, but I've applied

23:43.855 --> 23:45.521
an enhanced-resolution
pixel algorithm

23:45.557 --> 23:47.357
to scale up the mirror image
in the background.

23:47.392 --> 23:50.360
Well, the mirror looks like
it's reflecting something.

23:50.395 --> 23:53.796
Yeah, the closet where the
blackmailer took the video from.

23:53.832 --> 23:55.665
Now I'm gonna amp up
the color balance

23:55.700 --> 23:58.267
and brighten
the pixelation.

23:58.303 --> 23:59.902
Now, unfortunately, you still
can't make out the face.

23:59.938 --> 24:01.037
No.

24:01.072 --> 24:03.840
But look at chest level.
It looks like a name tag.

24:03.875 --> 24:05.842
Can you enhance even further?

24:05.877 --> 24:07.577
Uh, no, unfortunately.

24:07.612 --> 24:10.647
But, look, we know the guy's
wearing a green jacket

24:10.682 --> 24:12.482
with a yellow stripe
on its sleeve.

24:12.517 --> 24:14.283
The color scheme
of the Hotel Poggio.

24:14.319 --> 24:16.319
Right, which means
the blackmailer

24:16.354 --> 24:18.554
must be an employee.

24:18.590 --> 24:20.556
WELLS:
<i>Given Mr. Froome's statement</i>

24:20.592 --> 24:22.325
that the last time
he saw the victim,

24:22.360 --> 24:23.926
he was badly beaten
on the face,

24:23.962 --> 24:25.294
I reexamined the
bones for evidence

24:25.330 --> 24:27.363
of a physical
altercation.

24:27.399 --> 24:29.666
You're referring to the victim's
fight with the blackmailer?

24:29.701 --> 24:31.300
Yes. As you can see,

24:31.336 --> 24:34.771
I found bruising to all five
right proximal phalanges.

24:34.806 --> 24:38.141
The placement
of this micro-fracture

24:38.176 --> 24:40.009
on the thumb is strange.

24:40.045 --> 24:42.078
The victim was
an experienced fighter.

24:42.113 --> 24:44.514
Why would he hit
using the top of his fist?

24:44.549 --> 24:45.481
Yes, it's true,

24:45.517 --> 24:47.150
the victim was experienced,

24:47.185 --> 24:49.652
but even the best in their field
can become overconfident

24:49.688 --> 24:52.088
and, quite frankly,
sloppy from time to time.

24:52.123 --> 24:54.824
Dr. Wells, I'm only going
to say this one last time.

24:54.859 --> 24:56.659
My daughter did not cheat.

24:56.695 --> 24:58.661
Then there's no reason
not to let Dr. Hodgins

24:58.697 --> 25:00.763
test the ink to
confirm that I'm right.

25:00.799 --> 25:02.465
What about the teeth?

25:02.500 --> 25:04.333
Did I reexamine them?
Yes, of course.

25:04.369 --> 25:05.768
Dental damage
is quite common

25:05.804 --> 25:08.471
in instances of assault.

25:08.506 --> 25:12.909
Please note the chip on the
left maxillary first bicuspid.

25:12.944 --> 25:15.211
Suggestive of recent trauma.

25:15.246 --> 25:16.512
Also, I see something else.

25:16.548 --> 25:17.714
Here on the lingual surfaces

25:17.749 --> 25:20.917
of the central
maxillary incisors,

25:20.952 --> 25:24.187
there appears to be
an acid-like discoloration.

25:24.222 --> 25:25.621
(phone chirps)
Oh.

25:25.657 --> 25:26.756
It's Booth.

25:26.791 --> 25:28.024
H-He's picking me up.

25:28.059 --> 25:30.426
It appears he has a lead
on Abraham Froome's blackmailer.

25:30.462 --> 25:32.161
While you're gone, I'll
have Dr. Hodgins swab

25:32.197 --> 25:34.864
to see if we can discern
what damaged the teeth.

25:34.899 --> 25:36.866
And after
Dr. Hodgins is finished,

25:36.901 --> 25:40.436
have him analyze the ink
on my daughter's report card.

25:40.472 --> 25:42.105
An excellent idea.

25:42.140 --> 25:44.107
Perhaps you'd like to place
a little friendly wager

25:44.142 --> 25:45.641
over who is correct.

25:45.677 --> 25:48.344
BOOTH: <i>Bones, you got to be</i>
<i>kidding me, right?</i>

25:48.379 --> 25:49.912
You made a bet
with this creep?

25:49.948 --> 25:51.848
Booth, it's not a bet
if you know you're going to win.

25:51.883 --> 25:53.249
Aha, you know,
that's funny,

25:53.284 --> 25:55.485
because that's what gambling
addicts say all the time.

25:55.520 --> 25:57.487
Well, if it's any consolation,
it's not a monetary bet.

25:57.522 --> 26:00.456
That would be insensitive
and too close to home.

26:00.492 --> 26:02.592
Okay, so what is it, huh?
You're not gonna end up

26:02.627 --> 26:04.727
with a tattoo of this
guy's face or something?

26:04.763 --> 26:06.662
No, of course not,
because I'm going to win.

26:06.698 --> 26:08.064
Okay, you know what?

26:08.099 --> 26:09.232
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

26:09.267 --> 26:11.000
Do me a favor, open up
the file, see what we got.

26:11.035 --> 26:13.102
Fine, but I'm going to win.

26:13.138 --> 26:15.705
Okay, Valon Dudeshev.
Yes.

26:15.740 --> 26:18.407
He is a bellhop
at Hotel Poggio.

26:18.443 --> 26:20.376
Right, I called the
manager at the hotel,

26:20.411 --> 26:21.811
asked if any
of his employees

26:21.846 --> 26:23.746
showed any signs
of being in a fight.

26:23.782 --> 26:25.548
And Valon showed
such evidence?

26:25.583 --> 26:27.116
No, not exactly.

26:27.152 --> 26:29.051
See, he hasn't come into
work for the past week.

26:29.087 --> 26:31.687
The last time anyone saw
or heard from him

26:31.723 --> 26:33.790
was just before
our victim was killed.

26:36.528 --> 26:38.761
Okay, Valon's
apartment number is 447.

26:38.797 --> 26:39.896
Right here.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.464
Okay, I just want you
to stay back.

26:41.499 --> 26:42.965
I don't think
he's gonna come in quietly.

26:43.001 --> 26:43.933
(faint chatter)

26:43.968 --> 26:45.067
Oh, Booth.

26:45.103 --> 26:46.836
I think I hear
someone inside.

26:49.140 --> 26:51.374
FBI.

26:51.409 --> 26:52.608
(whispers): Okay, stand back.
I think he's coming.

26:52.644 --> 26:53.644
MAN:
Hello?

26:53.678 --> 26:54.877
Valon Dudeshev?

26:54.913 --> 26:56.279
Uh, maybe. Who is it?

26:56.314 --> 26:57.680
BOOTH:
It's the FBI.

26:57.715 --> 26:59.649
We need to ask you
some questions.

26:59.684 --> 27:01.517
Okay, ask.
No, open the door,

27:01.553 --> 27:02.485
and we'll ask questions.

27:02.520 --> 27:03.553
MAN:
No, no, no, no.

27:03.588 --> 27:05.154
I-I answer from here,
like this.

27:05.190 --> 27:06.989
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You're gonna open the door.

27:07.025 --> 27:08.524
If you don't,
I'm gonna break it down.

27:10.562 --> 27:13.396
All right, I'm kicking it in,
in three, two, one.

27:26.521 --> 27:29.637
I tell you, I did nothing.
I am victim here.

27:29.737 --> 27:32.137
Really? You're the
victim? All right.

27:32.172 --> 27:33.739
Then do you want to explain
this little, uh,

27:33.774 --> 27:36.675
blackmail video
that you made?

27:36.710 --> 27:38.910
See the stills that
we pulled off it?

27:38.946 --> 27:41.913
So you want to
explain this, huh?

27:43.484 --> 27:44.916
You not understand.

27:44.952 --> 27:47.252
This is very bad man.

27:47.288 --> 27:48.754
He is very wealthy,
but no tip.

27:48.789 --> 27:50.122
This is not reasonable.

27:50.157 --> 27:52.658
You blackmailed him
because he didn't tip you?

27:52.693 --> 27:54.760
Blackmail is very harsh.
I only make video

27:54.795 --> 27:57.663
and suggest good decision
for family.

27:57.698 --> 27:59.264
I'm sorry,
so what the hell happened?

27:59.300 --> 28:01.433
Frank slipped you the dye
after he handed over the cash?

28:01.468 --> 28:05.170
I do not know who this Frank is
you talk about.

28:05.205 --> 28:06.271
Frank. This man, Frank.

28:06.307 --> 28:07.773
That's the guy
you beat up.

28:07.808 --> 28:09.107
You told him to
go get the cash,

28:09.143 --> 28:11.009
and then you killed him.

28:11.045 --> 28:13.979
No, I kill no one!

28:14.014 --> 28:16.481
Last week, I come home,
this man is on couch.

28:16.517 --> 28:17.683
He has gun in hand.

28:17.718 --> 28:20.319
Right, you got into a fight.

28:20.354 --> 28:22.654
First, he take video I make,
then he rob me.

28:22.690 --> 28:23.855
Take my cell phone,

28:23.891 --> 28:24.856
my-my computer,
everything.

28:24.892 --> 28:25.892
Why?

28:25.926 --> 28:27.459
'Cause he crazy.

28:27.494 --> 28:31.563
Then... he tell me to get
in the tub with purple dye.

28:31.598 --> 28:33.765
If not, he shoot me.

28:33.801 --> 28:35.000
What about the money?

28:35.035 --> 28:36.802
No, no money!

28:36.837 --> 28:38.970
I am victim here.

28:39.006 --> 28:40.972
Why else would I look like this?

28:44.812 --> 28:47.612
Dr. Hodgins, do you have
the results from your swab

28:47.648 --> 28:50.349
of the lingual surfaces
of the central incisors?

28:50.384 --> 28:51.783
Yes, I do,

28:51.819 --> 28:52.984
but I owe you an apology.

28:53.020 --> 28:54.286
I had no idea

28:54.321 --> 28:56.154
that that report card
was Christine's.

28:56.190 --> 28:59.157
Does this mean
you have completed

28:59.193 --> 29:00.926
your analysis of the ink?

29:00.961 --> 29:02.928
What? No.
I-I didn't even start it.

29:02.963 --> 29:04.563
I mean, look,
Oliver tried to convince me

29:04.598 --> 29:05.831
that you were on board,

29:05.866 --> 29:07.199
but do not worry, okay?

29:07.234 --> 29:08.834
I know that that was a lie.
It is not.

29:08.869 --> 29:10.001
Please, run the test.

29:10.037 --> 29:12.237
Seriously?
Mm-hmm.

29:12.272 --> 29:14.339
Yeah, no, I mean,
if that's what you want.

29:14.375 --> 29:15.273
Yes.

29:15.309 --> 29:16.742
And...

29:16.777 --> 29:18.744
what about the swab
of the teeth?

29:18.779 --> 29:20.812
Right, yeah.
So, uh, what I found was

29:20.848 --> 29:22.514
a combination of
hydrochloric acid,

29:22.549 --> 29:23.682
potassium chloride

29:23.717 --> 29:25.517
and sodium chloride,

29:25.552 --> 29:27.886
or more commonly known
as gastric acid.

29:27.921 --> 29:29.955
Meaning the victim regurgitated
around time of death.

29:29.990 --> 29:31.823
Yeah, and since I don't think
this guy was the bulimic type,

29:31.859 --> 29:32.858
I had Cam test for poison.

29:32.893 --> 29:34.192
And what did she find?

29:34.228 --> 29:35.527
No poison.
Oh.

29:35.562 --> 29:37.129
But she did find
trace amounts of ketamine.

29:37.164 --> 29:38.830
Which means that
our killer tried

29:38.866 --> 29:40.365
to roofie our P.I.
before giving up

29:40.401 --> 29:41.833
and just whacking him
in the face

29:41.869 --> 29:42.834
with some blunt force object

29:42.870 --> 29:44.202
made out of wood.

29:44.238 --> 29:47.739
Actually, I'm not so sure
that's what happened.

29:52.346 --> 29:54.346
Okay, let me get
this straight.

29:54.381 --> 29:57.182
Your theory is that the victim
was given the ketamine

29:57.217 --> 29:59.818
in order to disorient him, but
upon feeling the effects...

29:59.853 --> 30:01.787
He ran to the nearest sink

30:01.822 --> 30:03.422
in order to purge the drug
from his system.

30:03.457 --> 30:04.823
Right.

30:04.858 --> 30:07.125
Okay, so this is the
rendering of the victim

30:07.161 --> 30:08.226
and the sink
in his office.

30:08.262 --> 30:09.394
Which is made
of white ash,

30:09.430 --> 30:12.130
same as the particulates

30:12.166 --> 30:13.799
found in the skull fragments.

30:13.834 --> 30:16.701
Now all we need to do
is make the avatar throw up

30:16.737 --> 30:20.338
and simulate the head
smashing into the sink.

30:20.374 --> 30:23.975
Uh, sorry, no,
can't do that.

30:24.011 --> 30:25.343
Which part?

30:25.379 --> 30:27.579
Uh, the smashing of the
skull is no problem,

30:27.614 --> 30:28.547
but the vomiting?

30:28.582 --> 30:29.981
No way.
Why not?

30:30.017 --> 30:31.883
Vomiting is disgusting.

30:31.919 --> 30:35.487
Angela, you have created
countless reenactments for me--

30:35.522 --> 30:38.790
stabbings, shootings,
even beheadings.

30:38.826 --> 30:41.660
But now you're saying
no to regurgitation.

30:41.695 --> 30:43.628
Girl's got to have
her standards.

30:46.200 --> 30:49.768
Okay, then the head trauma
alone will have to do.

30:57.144 --> 30:59.845
Oh. Looks like
we have a match.

31:02.616 --> 31:04.516
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

31:04.551 --> 31:06.618
AUBREY: You got anything?
No.

31:06.653 --> 31:08.353
No blood evidence.

31:08.388 --> 31:11.356
But based on the scratches
to this wood,

31:11.391 --> 31:14.593
I'd say this is
definitely where it happened.

31:14.628 --> 31:17.062
Who had access to this office?
What do you mean?

31:17.097 --> 31:19.030
Well, I mean, you've got a key,
don't you?

31:19.066 --> 31:20.298
Yeah, but so what?

31:20.334 --> 31:21.633
I was in Atlanta.

31:21.668 --> 31:23.401
Plus, Frank always
kept the door unlocked,

31:23.437 --> 31:25.770
so a friend or client could
come by any time they want.

31:28.675 --> 31:31.543
Dr. Brennan, I trust
you put Dr. Hodgins

31:31.578 --> 31:34.546
in his place and he's
proceeding with his analysis?

31:34.581 --> 31:36.882
I have, although I am concerned

31:36.917 --> 31:39.451
that this wager is
becoming a distraction.

31:39.486 --> 31:40.919
Never.

31:40.954 --> 31:43.455
In fact, allow me to show
you my latest discovery.

31:43.490 --> 31:46.324
Please note the, oh, so
subtle antemortem damage

31:46.360 --> 31:49.661
adjacent to the left
zygomaticofacial foramen.

31:49.696 --> 31:51.329
Interesting.

31:51.365 --> 31:52.964
These micro-fractures
are consistent

31:53.000 --> 31:55.233
with a fist
striking the skull.

31:55.269 --> 31:57.903
But the question remains:
who inflicted this damage?

31:57.938 --> 32:00.605
The victim claimed
it was his blackmailer,

32:00.641 --> 32:01.940
but that is illogical.

32:01.975 --> 32:04.776
Why? Because the blackmailer
was dyed purple?

32:04.811 --> 32:06.411
Or perhaps he dyed
himself purple?

32:06.446 --> 32:09.781
An action so idiotic,
it was in fact genius.

32:09.816 --> 32:11.016
No, just idiotic.

32:11.051 --> 32:13.418
I take it you have a
better explanation?

32:13.453 --> 32:17.822
What if the damage to the
victim's first proximal phalanx

32:17.858 --> 32:19.758
was self-inflicted?
I don't follow.

32:19.793 --> 32:23.328
I'm positing that the victim
caused both injuries to himself.

32:23.363 --> 32:25.363
And you thought my
scenario was idiotic.

32:25.399 --> 32:27.866
Why would someone punch
himself in the face?

32:27.901 --> 32:30.902
Oh, uh, actually,
I might have an answer for that.

32:30.938 --> 32:33.471
So we know the
bellhop claimed

32:33.507 --> 32:36.007
the victim stole his
cell phone, his computer,

32:36.043 --> 32:37.609
basically anything
that connected him

32:37.644 --> 32:39.010
with the outside world.

32:39.046 --> 32:40.145
Yes, by his account,

32:40.180 --> 32:42.180
he was dyed purple
and then robbed.

32:42.215 --> 32:43.882
Right.

32:43.917 --> 32:47.385
And since I don't have any
of his electronics to analyze,

32:47.421 --> 32:49.888
I thought that I could at least
confirm the date and time

32:49.923 --> 32:51.656
that his online presence
went dark.

32:51.692 --> 32:53.258
If they all happened
simultaneously...

32:53.293 --> 32:54.593
WELLS:
It would confirm

32:54.628 --> 32:55.627
his account of the events.

32:55.662 --> 32:56.795
Yeah.

32:56.830 --> 32:58.663
Okay, so the bellhop's

32:58.699 --> 33:00.432
cell phone,
Twitter account,

33:00.467 --> 33:01.900
tablets, I.P. addresses

33:01.935 --> 33:03.969
all went dark around
6:43 p.m. on Friday.

33:04.004 --> 33:06.404
So the bellhop
was telling the truth.

33:06.440 --> 33:08.106
And that's not even
the best part.

33:08.141 --> 33:12.243
Abraham Froome's bank accounts
show that he withdrew $2 million

33:12.279 --> 33:14.346
the day after Valon
went off the grid.

33:14.381 --> 33:15.747
So the victim lied.

33:15.782 --> 33:17.015
He secured the video,

33:17.050 --> 33:18.650
but he kept
the money for himself.

33:18.685 --> 33:21.987
And he bruised
and bloodied his own face

33:22.022 --> 33:24.222
in order to sell his story.

33:29.479 --> 33:30.604
Hey.

33:30.605 --> 33:32.572
Did some digging around for
Froome's missing two million,

33:32.607 --> 33:34.741
I found something I think
you're gonna want to see.

33:34.776 --> 33:36.676
Kerry Napoli's
bank statement.

33:36.711 --> 33:38.044
Well, where's
two million?

33:38.079 --> 33:39.679
All I see is a
thousand dollars here.

33:39.714 --> 33:42.415
You got to go to the second
page, okay, third line down.

33:42.450 --> 33:44.817
Look at the bank fee
for $62.58.

33:44.853 --> 33:47.286
(whistles)
Safety deposit box.

33:47.322 --> 33:49.422
Ten by ten inches.
She just got it a week ago.

33:49.457 --> 33:51.524
Big enough to hold
two million.

33:51.559 --> 33:53.660
Bring her in, will you?

33:55.597 --> 33:57.497
What the hell?

33:57.532 --> 34:00.233
You had no right to get into
my safety deposit box.

34:00.268 --> 34:02.468
There was no probable cause.

34:02.504 --> 34:04.504
One of your cases,
a-a few years back,

34:04.539 --> 34:07.106
you and Frank helped
an Omani prince

34:07.142 --> 34:10.143
beat a drunk driving
manslaughter charge in Jersey.

34:10.178 --> 34:11.178
You're kidding, right?

34:11.212 --> 34:12.645
The Patriot Act?
That's how you got a warrant?

34:12.681 --> 34:14.246
See it turns out,
our friends

34:14.282 --> 34:16.282
at Homeland Security were
curious about what was inside.

34:16.317 --> 34:18.083
They wanted to make
sure you weren't

34:18.119 --> 34:19.485
aiding and abetting
a known terrorist.

34:19.521 --> 34:20.853
Yeah.

34:20.889 --> 34:23.322
(sighs)

34:23.358 --> 34:25.925
Look, I opened
that safety deposit box

34:25.960 --> 34:27.927
because that's what
Frank wanted.

34:27.962 --> 34:30.463
He had me put
the money in there.

34:30.498 --> 34:33.166
Because you were
having an affair.

34:33.201 --> 34:36.835
Frank's plan was for us
to leave the business

34:36.871 --> 34:38.638
and move to Amsterdam.

34:38.672 --> 34:40.273
Maybe South America.

34:40.308 --> 34:42.308
Why didn't you tell us
about this sooner?

34:42.342 --> 34:43.643
Why do you think?

34:43.678 --> 34:45.578
Look, I know this looks bad,
but I swear,

34:45.612 --> 34:47.714
I was just doing
what Frank told me to do.

34:47.748 --> 34:49.348
And what about Frank's wife?

34:49.384 --> 34:50.949
Was she aware of the affair?

34:50.985 --> 34:53.119
Honestly, I don't know.

34:53.154 --> 34:54.786
Kerry, we're gonna need

34:54.822 --> 34:57.056
to hold you here
until further notice.

34:57.092 --> 34:58.458
Fine.

34:58.493 --> 35:00.927
But I would like to speak
to an attorney.

35:03.865 --> 35:06.933
Hey, Dr. B, I got results for
both of the tests you ordered.

35:06.968 --> 35:08.234
What do you mean, both?

35:08.269 --> 35:09.736
I thought we were just
waiting on the ink.

35:09.771 --> 35:12.371
We were, but then I found
something probative

35:12.407 --> 35:14.140
that you missed.
That's impossible.

35:14.175 --> 35:15.608
I haven't missed anything.

35:15.643 --> 35:17.443
Look here.

35:17.479 --> 35:21.180
We know the victim's head
was driven into his own sink.

35:21.216 --> 35:24.517
However, what you failed
to do was closely examine

35:24.552 --> 35:27.019
the posterior surface of
the skull for any damage

35:27.055 --> 35:31.457
due to a forward
thrusting blow.

35:31.493 --> 35:33.593
And as you can see,

35:33.628 --> 35:36.496
there is
a faint scratch adjacent

35:36.531 --> 35:39.565
to the nuchal crest
of the occipital bone.

35:39.601 --> 35:42.902
I see. And this scratch was
likely caused by the killer?

35:42.937 --> 35:44.137
HODGINS: Which results
would you like first?

35:44.172 --> 35:45.772
The swab or the ink analysis?

35:45.807 --> 35:48.975
I'll let Dr. Wells decide.

35:49.010 --> 35:50.610
The ink analysis.

35:50.645 --> 35:53.079
Okay, so I ran
a thin layer chromatography

35:53.114 --> 35:55.948
on the actual plus sign.

35:55.984 --> 35:57.083
And then,
to confirm the results,

35:57.118 --> 35:58.651
I actually processed it through

35:58.686 --> 36:02.588
imaging electro-spray
ionization, as you can see.

36:02.624 --> 36:04.924
The results
were definitive.

36:04.959 --> 36:08.828
The plus sign was made up
of two different inks.

36:08.863 --> 36:11.130
As a gentleman,
I will do you the courtesy

36:11.166 --> 36:13.499
of not saying "I told you so."

36:13.535 --> 36:15.902
Even though you just did.

36:15.937 --> 36:18.004
Dr. Hodgins,
what of the test

36:18.039 --> 36:19.539
that actually matters,

36:19.574 --> 36:21.707
the swab results
from the occipital?

36:21.743 --> 36:24.443
So, the mass-spec
found evidence

36:24.479 --> 36:26.913
of zirconium dioxide
and nine karat gold.

36:26.948 --> 36:28.548
So the victim was
likely scratched

36:28.583 --> 36:31.450
by some cheap,
gaudy jewelry made of

36:31.486 --> 36:34.187
low-grade gold
and cubic zirconia.

36:34.222 --> 36:36.289
I'll let Booth know right away.

36:39.394 --> 36:40.593
All right, just listen to me,
all right?

36:40.628 --> 36:41.594
Hold on for a second, okay?

36:41.629 --> 36:43.262
If you play ball with me,

36:43.298 --> 36:45.298
none of this is gonna make it
to the papers, all right?

36:45.333 --> 36:46.666
Great.

36:46.701 --> 36:49.235
Okay, you'll be hearing
from me soon. Thanks.

36:49.270 --> 36:50.970
Booth, what is going on?
I just looked in interrogation.

36:51.005 --> 36:52.738
I thought you were bringing
in the wife, Lissa Bowman.

36:52.774 --> 36:54.473
Oh, yeah, I was,
until I took a look

36:54.509 --> 36:56.008
at her monthly
credit card statement.

36:56.044 --> 36:57.944
Take a look at that, huh?

36:57.979 --> 37:00.112
Ten times more than my mortgage.
Okay, she's rich.

37:00.148 --> 37:02.014
So what?
Exactly, she's rich.

37:02.050 --> 37:03.482
Okay, rich people
don't go around

37:03.518 --> 37:05.585
wearing nine karat gold
or cubic zirconia.

37:05.620 --> 37:07.320
Only young women
wear that.

37:07.355 --> 37:08.621
Yeah, but she's
got a motive.

37:08.656 --> 37:09.989
Her husband was
having an affair.

37:10.024 --> 37:11.424
Kerry Napoli's got an alibi.

37:11.459 --> 37:13.459
Does she?
I don't think so.

37:18.366 --> 37:20.166
Kerry, I'm Agent Booth.

37:20.201 --> 37:21.601
I have some questions for you.

37:21.636 --> 37:23.502
Agent Booth, before
you say another word,

37:23.538 --> 37:25.471
I'll have you know
my client is willing

37:25.506 --> 37:26.739
to confess to her part

37:26.774 --> 37:28.674
in robbing Mr. Froome.

37:28.710 --> 37:30.042
And what about
murdering your boss?

37:30.078 --> 37:31.677
I loved Frank;
we were going to spend

37:31.713 --> 37:32.845
the rest of our lives together.

37:32.881 --> 37:34.513
I don't buy it.
You're a P.I.

37:34.549 --> 37:35.982
You're not some
naive little girl

37:36.017 --> 37:38.017
who believes in
happily ever after.

37:38.052 --> 37:41.254
You killed him and you took the
money when you had the chance.

37:41.289 --> 37:43.289
Really? That's your theory?

37:43.324 --> 37:45.324
Well, there's just
one little problem.

37:45.360 --> 37:48.027
I've got a dozen witnesses
that saw me in Atlanta that day.

37:48.062 --> 37:49.495
Right, your alibi,
but you see,

37:49.530 --> 37:50.463
here's the thing.

37:50.498 --> 37:52.265
See, your witnesses
are your clients.

37:52.300 --> 37:54.967
So what?
So...

37:55.003 --> 37:58.037
I know you have dirt on every
single one of your clients.

37:58.072 --> 38:00.206
You blackmailed them
for an alibi.

38:00.241 --> 38:02.408
He's lying.

38:02.443 --> 38:04.377
There's no way
you can prove that.

38:04.412 --> 38:06.178
I just talked
to one of your clients,

38:06.214 --> 38:08.881
and when I told him that
you couldn't extort him anymore,

38:08.917 --> 38:11.784
let's just say he was
singing a different tune.

38:11.819 --> 38:15.087
You're bluffing; you're just
trying to get me to confess.

38:15.123 --> 38:16.255
Bluffing?

38:16.291 --> 38:19.058
No, I'm not bluffing.

38:19.093 --> 38:21.060
I don't need a confession.

38:21.095 --> 38:23.462
See, I have evidence,
means and motive.

38:23.498 --> 38:26.299
Which means you're under arrest.

38:36.077 --> 38:38.144
SAROYAN:
This is nice,

38:38.179 --> 38:40.079
and a long time coming.

38:40.114 --> 38:43.683
In fact, I would like to
propose a toast to Hodgins.

38:43.718 --> 38:45.618
It's great to see you
out and about again.

38:45.653 --> 38:46.886
AUBREY:
Here, here.

38:46.921 --> 38:47.921
MONTENEGRO:
Cheers.

38:47.956 --> 38:49.722
Good to have
you back, old man.

38:49.757 --> 38:52.725
And to Angela, for forcing
Hodgins to get out and about.

38:52.760 --> 38:55.394
Thank you. It was not easy.

38:55.430 --> 38:57.563
Yeah, how exactly
did you do that?

38:57.598 --> 39:01.367
Oh, by giving away the jewelry
that, uh, I gave her.

39:01.402 --> 39:02.702
SAROYAN:
Yep.

39:02.737 --> 39:04.804
I have to say, I think
these look pretty fab on me.

39:04.839 --> 39:07.740
And the only way that
Hodgins can get them back

39:07.775 --> 39:10.409
to return them is
by going out with me tonight

39:10.445 --> 39:13.512
and three more times
this month.

39:13.548 --> 39:14.780
Drives a hard bargain, huh?

39:14.816 --> 39:15.816
SAROYAN:
Well, until then,

39:15.850 --> 39:17.950
these babies are mine.

39:24.258 --> 39:26.692
Hi, there.
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

39:26.728 --> 39:28.127
I'm Camille Saroyan.

39:28.162 --> 39:29.528
I don't think
we've officially met.

39:29.564 --> 39:30.696
You must be Karen Delfs.

39:30.732 --> 39:32.131
Yes, nice to meet you.

39:32.166 --> 39:34.967
And so weird,
because I feel like I know you,

39:35.003 --> 39:37.003
since I've read
your psychological profile.

39:38.072 --> 39:39.672
Can I speak to you for a second?

39:39.707 --> 39:41.774
Absolutely.
Be right back.

39:41.809 --> 39:43.309
Bye.

39:43.344 --> 39:44.310
(clears throat)

39:44.345 --> 39:46.245
Okay, what is going on?

39:46.280 --> 39:48.681
You're not gonna ask me
to coffee again, are you?

39:48.716 --> 39:49.682
No.

39:49.717 --> 39:50.883
Get over yourself.

39:50.918 --> 39:53.019
I actually found a date for
tonight, thank you very much.

39:53.054 --> 39:54.653
He's right over there.

39:54.689 --> 39:56.288
AUBREY:
Really? Wow.

39:56.324 --> 39:58.257
Yeah. To be honest
with you, he's...

39:58.292 --> 39:59.992
he's dumb as a box of hair,

40:00.028 --> 40:01.660
but, you know,
beggars can't be choosers.

40:01.696 --> 40:03.396
Besides, not like
I want something long-term.

40:03.431 --> 40:06.465
I'm just sort of looking for one
last fling before I leave town.

40:06.501 --> 40:08.367
I'm sorry, you
going somewhere?

40:08.403 --> 40:11.704
Oh, I'm being transferred
to Kansas City on Monday.

40:11.739 --> 40:12.805
Really?
Yeah.

40:12.840 --> 40:14.774
I had no idea.
Well.

40:14.809 --> 40:16.709
Listen, why don't you let me,
uh, buy you a drink

40:16.744 --> 40:18.044
before you hit the road.

40:18.079 --> 40:20.746
No, no, no. I really,
um, I have to get going,

40:20.782 --> 40:24.383
but I think you need
to take a look at this first.

40:24.419 --> 40:26.285
Karen, I already
told you, look,

40:26.320 --> 40:27.853
I'm not reading
this file, okay?

40:27.889 --> 40:29.855
What happened with my
father, it's in the past.

40:29.891 --> 40:31.023
I'm-I'm over it.

40:31.059 --> 40:32.658
No, see,
it's not in the past.

40:32.693 --> 40:34.660
This file was started
six months ago.

40:34.695 --> 40:35.861
Your dad isn't
abroad anymore.

40:35.897 --> 40:36.962
He's here.

40:36.998 --> 40:38.230
He's in D.C.

40:38.266 --> 40:41.734
And the person
that he's investigating...

40:41.769 --> 40:44.003
it's you.

41:01.656 --> 41:03.856
What's going on?
Are you okay?

41:03.891 --> 41:05.024
No, I'm not.

41:05.059 --> 41:06.659
I lost my bet
with Dr. Wells,

41:06.694 --> 41:08.894
and as a result,
I have to pay up.

41:08.930 --> 41:11.330
(laughs) Great. What is it?
What do you have to do?

41:11.365 --> 41:12.531
It's not funny.

41:12.567 --> 41:15.167
I'm now the voice
mail on his phone.

41:15.203 --> 41:17.937
This is what he
had me record.

41:17.972 --> 41:19.672
Hmm. (sighs)

41:19.707 --> 41:21.407
Okay. "Hello.

41:21.442 --> 41:24.477
"You've reached the voice mail
for Dr. Oliver Wells,

41:24.512 --> 41:26.278
"the most brilliant

41:26.314 --> 41:28.914
"forensic anthropologist
in the history

41:28.950 --> 41:29.882
of the Jeffersonian."

41:29.917 --> 41:31.357
Bones, this is, like,
two pages long.

41:31.385 --> 41:33.052
How can you do that?
It's humiliating.

41:33.087 --> 41:35.454
And what's worse
is that tomorrow

41:35.490 --> 41:37.490
you and I will have
to have a conversation

41:37.525 --> 41:39.291
with Christine
about cheating.

41:39.327 --> 41:40.693
No, we don't.

41:40.728 --> 41:41.760
Yes, we do.

41:41.796 --> 41:42.995
The grade was altered, Booth.

41:43.030 --> 41:45.264
It was scientifically proven.

41:45.299 --> 41:46.599
Uh-uh, you're looking
at it all wrong.

41:46.634 --> 41:49.268
Turn the report card over.
Look at the teacher's signature.

41:50.471 --> 41:52.771
Ink. Ink, ink, color, color.
Okay. What?

41:54.008 --> 41:55.708
Oh, wait.

41:55.743 --> 41:58.978
It appears the signature
is made up of the same ink

41:59.013 --> 42:01.647
that was used to
complete the plus sign.

42:01.682 --> 42:03.282
Exactly.
And you really think

42:03.317 --> 42:06.018
that our little girl
would be able to, what,

42:06.053 --> 42:07.253
forge an adult's signature?

42:07.288 --> 42:08.687
Of course not.

42:08.723 --> 42:10.956
I talked to the teacher today,
Mrs. Gallagher,

42:10.992 --> 42:12.758
and she told me
that she ran out of ink

42:12.793 --> 42:14.760
halfway through
the report card.

42:14.795 --> 42:15.961
So she picked up another pen.

42:15.997 --> 42:17.437
And finished
what she intended to do,

42:17.465 --> 42:21.133
and that was give our brilliant
little kid an E-plus in Art.

42:21.169 --> 42:22.535
I knew it!

42:22.570 --> 42:23.802
What? What?
What? What?

42:23.838 --> 42:25.104
I knew it. I knew it!

42:25.139 --> 42:26.438
Yeah!
See, you should admit it.

42:26.474 --> 42:28.674
Admit it
that your science is bunk.

42:28.709 --> 42:30.576
Booth, no, technically,
the science was not,

42:30.611 --> 42:34.480
but I will concede I did not
see the complete picture.

42:34.515 --> 42:36.615
What are you doing?
I'm calling Dr. Wells.

42:36.651 --> 42:40.186
Uh, he needs to change his
voice mail immediately.

42:40.221 --> 42:42.154
BRENNAN (recorded): Hello. You
have reached the voice mail...

42:42.190 --> 42:43.155
Okay, Bones, you can
fast-forward that

42:43.191 --> 42:44.356
by just pressing the pound...
No, hold on.

42:44.392 --> 42:45.724
I want to hear it. I...
You have to admit,

42:45.760 --> 42:46.725
I have an excellent voice.

42:46.761 --> 42:47.893
What?
Are you kidding me?

42:47.929 --> 42:49.261
Yes, it's quite sonorous.

42:49.297 --> 42:50.462
Sonorous? What is that?

42:50.498 --> 42:52.231
Sonorous.
What do you mean?

42:52.266 --> 42:53.332
Bypass it.
Press pound once.

42:53.367 --> 42:54.300
No, Booth, shh.

42:54.335 --> 42:56.202
If you keep talking...

42:58.694 --> 43:05.194
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00FF00">elderman</font> ==
