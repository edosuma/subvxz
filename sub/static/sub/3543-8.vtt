is different.

Something has changed
between Damon and me.

00:26.430 --> 00:28.363

like me this way.

to Damon,

01:35.266 --> 01:38.049

singular burning desire

01:38.051 --> 01:40.769
is to make him happy,
just like Klaus and his hybrids.

just give it another try,

because the hybrids

for relieving them

from the pain of having
to wolf out every full moon,

have to turn

ruled by the pain anymore.

is not a werewolf.

took full advantage of that

11:31.945 --> 11:33.661
until you got bored
of her, right?

11:33.663 --> 11:35.580
More like when she went
all "fatal attraction" on me.

11:35.582 --> 11:36.948
Then I had to make
a clean break.

Thanks to Damon, I am now
a functional dysfunctional vampire.

12:23.495 --> 12:24.994
Well, he suggested
that I try it again.

and it worked.

Are you doing what's best for
Elena or what's best for you?

long time

21:42.060 --> 21:43.743
stuck listening
to the same song.

21:43.745 --> 21:45.228
Yeah. Heh.

21:45.230 --> 21:48.582
Well, you know,
in the plus column,

21:48.584 --> 21:50.917
you know new Orleans better
than anyone in the world,

21:50.919 --> 21:53.069
which is really nice

21:53.071 --> 21:55.255
because we need your help
finding someone.

21:55.257 --> 21:58.425
[Music playing]

22:26.971 --> 22:28.238
All right!

22:29.373 --> 22:31.992
Aah!
Aah!

22:34.996 --> 22:36.746
[All giggling]

22:38.916 --> 22:42.886
Check this out...
Vamp speed video.

22:42.888 --> 22:44.888
Mm.

22:44.890 --> 22:47.007
I look like
superman.

22:47.009 --> 22:48.291
Watch this.

22:48.293 --> 22:50.760
This year's
Christmas card.

22:50.762 --> 22:53.230
[Laughter]

22:53.232 --> 22:55.515
Being a vampire
is so weird.

22:55.517 --> 22:57.767
Oh, my God,
I love this bathtub.

22:57.769 --> 22:59.736
Why don't we come
and hang out here more often?

22:59.738 --> 23:02.505
I'll tell you why.
Cooties.

23:02.507 --> 23:04.608
Think of all
the germ-ridden skanks

23:04.610 --> 23:08.328
that Damon has lured
into his den of iniquity.

23:11.365 --> 23:13.583
Ok. I'm sorry.
I've been good all night.

23:13.585 --> 23:15.035
I am stopping now.

23:15.037 --> 23:17.003
No. Don't stop
on my account.

23:17.005 --> 23:18.255
Rip away.

23:18.257 --> 23:19.623
I mean, it's only
Damon, right?

23:19.625 --> 23:21.341
Well, say what you want
about ripper Stefan,

23:21.343 --> 23:24.094
but at least he
wasn't a man slut.

23:24.096 --> 23:25.795
Come on.

23:25.797 --> 23:27.380
So what exactly
was it about him

23:27.382 --> 23:29.182
that made you jump
right into bed with him

23:29.184 --> 23:30.934
as soon as you met him?

23:30.936 --> 23:34.521
I didn't know what
a sociopathic narcissist he was.

23:34.523 --> 23:36.523
He's always been there for me
when I needed him.

23:36.525 --> 23:39.008
Yeah, because he's hoping
you'll sleep with him.

23:39.010 --> 23:41.027
Well, maybe I did.

23:41.029 --> 23:43.313
You did what?
You didn't.

23:43.315 --> 23:46.700
Yeah. I did.

23:46.702 --> 23:48.985
Look. I know you two
have issues with him,

23:48.987 --> 23:52.105
but I'm happy,
and I wanted to spend tonight

23:52.107 --> 23:54.991
with my best friends so that
I could tell them about it.

23:59.997 --> 24:02.198
[Bell rings]

24:06.170 --> 24:08.638
Can I help you,
gentlemen?

24:08.640 --> 24:10.540
Damon: Hi.
Looking for a witch.

24:10.542 --> 24:12.642
Sorry. No time
for pleasantries.

24:12.644 --> 24:14.544
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

24:14.546 --> 24:17.380
Look...
Nandi, is it?

24:17.382 --> 24:18.898
Let's skip the part
where you pretend

24:18.900 --> 24:21.050
like you don't know what
we're talking about.

24:21.052 --> 24:23.386
We need a spell that could
break a vampire sire bond.

24:23.388 --> 24:25.221
Now, there was a witch here
named val.

24:25.223 --> 24:26.856
Ring any bells?

24:26.858 --> 24:28.742
She was my
great-grandmother.

24:28.744 --> 24:32.245
She had a grimoire,
and it had a spell.

24:32.247 --> 24:34.998
Val: The magic
you're talking about

24:35.000 --> 24:37.500
is dark, powerful.

24:37.502 --> 24:40.036
Magic like this
doesn't come cheap.

24:43.240 --> 24:45.008
How much?

24:45.010 --> 24:47.594
Money won't cut it
here, pretty one.

24:47.596 --> 24:50.930
Dark magic draws power
from dark places.

24:50.932 --> 24:52.682
Casting the spell
you need

24:52.684 --> 24:56.686
requires the sacrifice
of 12 human souls.

24:56.688 --> 24:58.087
Stefan: A sacrifice?

24:58.089 --> 24:59.255
You brought me here
knowing that the spell

24:59.257 --> 25:00.273
required
a human sacrifice.

25:00.275 --> 25:01.608
Well, I was hoping
the recipe had changed.

25:01.610 --> 25:03.760
Look. There's no magic
like that here.

25:03.762 --> 25:05.862
I sell herbs
and homeopathic remedies

25:05.864 --> 25:07.731
and dress it up
with a little witchy-woo

25:07.733 --> 25:09.932
for the tourists,
but I don't practice.

25:09.934 --> 25:11.951
Ok. Fine. Listen.

25:11.953 --> 25:13.486
Just tell us where
we can find someone

25:13.488 --> 25:15.822
like your great-grandma
who can break the sire bond

25:15.824 --> 25:17.807
and won't flake out on us
like old val did.

25:17.809 --> 25:19.108
There's no one.

25:19.110 --> 25:22.128
All of her stuff is gone...
The grimoires, her journals.

25:22.130 --> 25:24.280
We lost it all
during Katrina.

25:24.282 --> 25:26.366
If a spell like that
ever existed,

25:26.368 --> 25:29.085
it's gone for good.

25:35.092 --> 25:37.260
Elena, come here.

25:37.262 --> 25:39.312
Party is over.
You guys need to leave.

25:39.314 --> 25:42.432
Don't be mad, ok?
We're just looking out for you.

25:42.434 --> 25:44.133
Do you think it
makes me happy

25:44.135 --> 25:46.152
that you guys
hate him?

25:46.154 --> 25:47.604
I get it.

25:47.606 --> 25:49.322
His track record has
been kind of spotty,

25:49.324 --> 25:51.241
but I don't
hate him.

25:51.243 --> 25:52.642
I can't. He's...

25:54.612 --> 25:56.746
I think I'm falling
in love with him.

25:56.748 --> 25:58.248
Ugh, you're not falling
in love with him, Elena.

25:58.250 --> 26:00.650
You're sired
to him.

26:00.652 --> 26:03.002
What?

26:03.004 --> 26:05.455
What are you
talking about?

26:05.457 --> 26:07.290
I...

26:07.292 --> 26:10.677
Look. I'm sorry
that it came out like that,

26:10.679 --> 26:12.512
but it's true.

26:12.514 --> 26:14.214
Damon's blood turned you.

26:14.216 --> 26:17.300
You couldn't feed
from animals or blood bags

26:17.302 --> 26:18.768
because he told you so.

26:18.770 --> 26:21.221
Then he suggested that you
try again with blood bags,

26:21.223 --> 26:23.356
and suddenly...
No.

26:23.358 --> 26:27.510
There's no way. I...
Are you sure?

26:27.512 --> 26:29.145
Yeah.
Ask Stefan about it.

26:29.147 --> 26:30.847
He can explain it
better than I can.

26:30.849 --> 26:32.849
I'm sorry. You talked
to Stefan about this?

26:32.851 --> 26:37.237
It's not your fault,
Elena, ok?

26:37.239 --> 26:39.622
Damon took advantage
of you.

26:39.624 --> 26:44.410
Ok. You need to leave... Now.

26:44.412 --> 26:47.664
Elena... Come on.

26:47.666 --> 26:49.415
I said leave.

26:49.417 --> 26:51.084
Hello, girls.

26:52.386 --> 26:53.553
Ugh!

26:59.643 --> 27:01.761
[Rumbling]

27:04.882 --> 27:07.066
Stop.

27:07.068 --> 27:09.602
One bite from a hybrid,
and she's dead, remember?

27:12.823 --> 27:17.059
[Whoosh] Caroline.

27:24.475 --> 27:25.809
Witch is lying.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.444
Doesn't practice
magic, my ass.

27:27.446 --> 27:29.113
Human sacrifice?

27:29.115 --> 27:30.497
Did you really think
that I would go for this?

27:30.499 --> 27:34.001
Extreme circumstances
call for extreme measures.

27:34.003 --> 27:36.537
Did you kill those
12 people in 1942?

27:36.539 --> 27:39.039
Absolutely, I did,
and I'd do it again

27:39.041 --> 27:41.125
in a heartbeat if it meant
a clean slate with Elena.

27:41.127 --> 27:42.509
Hmm.

27:42.511 --> 27:45.662
Are you gonna help me good
cop/bad cop this witch, or not?

27:47.165 --> 27:48.632
I get it, hayley.

27:48.634 --> 27:50.217
I'll find them, and
I'll get them in line.

27:50.219 --> 27:52.219
Bonnie says no luck
with the locator spell.

27:52.221 --> 27:53.804
They've got to be here.

27:53.806 --> 27:55.222
They're not dumb enough
to risk getting caught

27:55.224 --> 27:56.724
by Klaus in town.

27:56.726 --> 27:58.225
Well, what do they want
with Caroline?

27:58.227 --> 27:59.843
Kim is trying to prove
she's the Alpha.

27:59.845 --> 28:02.029
If I can make her submit,
the pack will fall in line,

28:02.031 --> 28:03.981
and we can finally get them
free of Klaus.

28:03.983 --> 28:05.849
You'd think they'd play along
with how much they hate him.

28:05.851 --> 28:08.319
But Adrian doesn't,
does he?

28:08.321 --> 28:09.853
I mean, he's still
sired to Klaus.

28:09.855 --> 28:12.990
Being sired doesn't mean you
feel differently about someone.

28:12.992 --> 28:15.392
I hated Klaus,
but I still did everything he said.

28:16.328 --> 28:18.195
The bond affects
how you act,

28:18.197 --> 28:20.464
not how you feel.

28:20.466 --> 28:22.216
Caroline: Aah!

28:22.218 --> 28:25.120
Caroline.

28:31.876 --> 28:33.677
What are you
doing here?

28:33.679 --> 28:34.862
Calling you out.

28:34.864 --> 28:36.480
You're not Val's
great-granddaughter.

28:36.482 --> 28:38.732
You're her daughter.

28:42.604 --> 28:46.190
You're 80 years old.
You don't look a day over 50.

28:46.192 --> 28:47.741
You're a
practicing witch.

28:47.743 --> 28:49.243
Get out of my store.

28:49.245 --> 28:51.495
Give me what I want.

28:51.497 --> 28:54.581
Ugh! Yaagh! Gaah!

28:54.583 --> 28:58.752
I gave you a chance
to leave with your life.

28:58.754 --> 29:00.404
Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

29:00.406 --> 29:01.588
We don't want
any trouble, ok?

29:01.590 --> 29:04.375
We just need your help.
That's all.

29:04.377 --> 29:06.010
I told you,

29:06.012 --> 29:08.462
there's no one here
who can help you.

29:08.464 --> 29:09.763
Agh!

29:09.765 --> 29:13.517
The kind of magic my mother
practiced, it's unnatural.

29:13.519 --> 29:15.752
Witches don't even
call it magic.

29:15.754 --> 29:18.922
We call it expression.

29:19.891 --> 29:21.758
Is that like
black magic?

29:21.760 --> 29:22.943
Worse.

29:22.945 --> 29:24.945
Channeling the power
of human sacrifices

29:24.947 --> 29:26.897
calls on darkness
that can't exist

29:26.899 --> 29:29.900
on this plane without
swallowing it whole.

29:29.902 --> 29:33.153
She sold you a bill of goods
about breaking the sire bond

29:33.155 --> 29:35.439
because she wanted
access to that power,

29:35.441 --> 29:38.275
and you gave it to her when
you killed those 12 people.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.961
Are you saying
there's no spell?

29:40.963 --> 29:43.247
The bond can't be
broken with magic.

29:43.249 --> 29:46.500
A vampire only bonds
to her sire

29:46.502 --> 29:48.419
when she has
feelings for him

29:48.421 --> 29:51.388
before she turns,
human feelings.

29:51.390 --> 29:55.642
Vampirism only
heightens those emotions.

29:59.481 --> 30:03.484
You want her free?
You have to set her free.

30:03.486 --> 30:05.519
Tell her to live
her life without you

30:05.521 --> 30:07.071
and never think
of you again,

30:07.073 --> 30:08.839
to stop caring
about you,

30:08.841 --> 30:11.475
and then leave her.

30:11.477 --> 30:14.995
That's the only way
around the sire bond.

30:17.832 --> 30:19.867
Aah! Yaah!

30:19.869 --> 30:21.835
Why are you
doing this?

30:21.837 --> 30:24.421
To show Tyler
who's in charge.

30:24.423 --> 30:25.839
Aah!

30:25.841 --> 30:28.325
Tyler: Stop it.
Stop it, Kim.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.494
Caroline is
with us, all right?

30:30.496 --> 30:31.661
We're all
on the same team.

30:31.663 --> 30:34.431
Kim: She's on
your team, not mine.

30:47.954 --> 30:49.805
Aah!
Stop it! Stop!

30:49.807 --> 30:52.174
Adrian: Ease up, Kim.
Klaus won't like this.

30:52.176 --> 30:54.426
Huh, that's
a very good point.

30:54.428 --> 30:56.311
Do you think
he'll like this?

30:57.931 --> 31:00.131
Kim, don't do it.
I swear to God...

31:00.133 --> 31:01.400
Elena: No. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

31:01.402 --> 31:02.935
If you really want to
hit Klaus where it hurts,

31:02.937 --> 31:04.403
then torture me
instead.

31:04.405 --> 31:07.155
He's fixated
on keeping me alive.

31:07.157 --> 31:11.159
You want real
revenge, or not?

31:14.697 --> 31:16.114
Uh!

31:17.283 --> 31:20.318
Ugh! Stay back!

31:20.320 --> 31:22.671
I'll rip her heart out
right now.

31:23.957 --> 31:26.341
Kim put you all
at risk today,

31:26.343 --> 31:27.926
and I'm not
gonna hurt her.

31:27.928 --> 31:29.511
I'm not Klaus.

31:29.513 --> 31:32.931
I don't kill and torture
my own friends to get what I want.

31:32.933 --> 31:35.000
Now, we broke
the sire bond,

31:35.002 --> 31:37.002
but if you want
to be free,

31:37.004 --> 31:39.438
we have to work
together.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.690
No one can step
out of line.

31:41.692 --> 31:44.309
Now, you're either
with me

31:44.311 --> 31:47.112
or you're against me.

31:47.114 --> 31:48.814
Submit.

31:48.816 --> 31:50.866
Submit, or you die.

31:53.403 --> 31:56.705
I'm...
I'm sorry.

31:57.707 --> 32:00.993
[Gasping]

32:29.439 --> 32:32.858
So you're just
leaving me again?

32:32.860 --> 32:35.744
No. I need to get on
with my life,

32:35.746 --> 32:37.446
and so do you.

32:37.448 --> 32:39.031
I don't want to live
without you.

32:39.033 --> 32:41.733
If you want to make me happy,
you will.

32:41.735 --> 32:44.619
You just forget
about me.

32:44.621 --> 32:46.571
You'll never
think of me again,

32:46.573 --> 32:50.742
and you'll find someone new,
and you'll be happier than ever.

32:50.744 --> 32:54.262
Please just
stop crying.

32:58.418 --> 33:00.919
I'm never gonna be able
to forget about you.

33:00.921 --> 33:02.688
Yes. You are,

33:02.690 --> 33:05.757
and I'm never gonna
be happy until you realize

33:05.759 --> 33:08.760
that you're never gonna
have the life that you deserve

33:35.338 --> 33:38.807
How'd it go?
Set her free.

33:38.809 --> 33:42.427
Must've been hard,
doing the right thing,

33:42.429 --> 33:44.479
especially when it's not
something you want to do.

33:44.481 --> 33:46.148
Get to the point,
Stefan.

33:46.150 --> 33:47.899
You don't think I'm gonna
be able to do what I need to

33:47.901 --> 33:49.601
when I have to tell Elena
to stay away from me.

33:49.603 --> 33:51.653
Well, I mean,
selflessness isn't exactly

33:51.655 --> 33:54.322
one of your most obvious
character traits, Damon.

33:54.324 --> 33:56.525
Yeah? Well, one of these days,
you're gonna realize

33:56.527 --> 33:58.777
you don't know me
half as well as you think.

Hi. All right.

34:22.601 --> 34:27.938
Lexi: Damon... I
know what you did,

34:27.940 --> 34:30.225
and you're not going
overseas with Stefan.

34:30.226 --> 34:32.310
Do you understand me?

34:32.312 --> 34:35.647
Well, Uncle Sam
begs to differ.

34:35.649 --> 34:41.453
You just killed
12 innocent people.

34:41.455 --> 34:43.621
How do you know they
didn't have it coming?

34:43.623 --> 34:46.024
Your brother has spent
the last 20 years

34:46.025 --> 34:48.659
racked with guilt,
fighting the temptation

34:48.661 --> 34:50.579
to drink human blood.

34:50.581 --> 34:52.714
He's serving in war
as penance

34:52.716 --> 34:54.815
for the pain
that he's caused.

34:54.818 --> 34:56.902
If he finds out
what you did,

34:56.904 --> 34:59.370
he'll want to know
how it is you function

34:59.372 --> 35:02.808
without guilt for
the things that you do.

35:02.810 --> 35:06.178
He'll turn to you for
guidance like he did before,

35:06.180 --> 35:08.680
and he'll become
the ripper of Monterrey

I've pretty much
been on my own

35:13.437 --> 35:16.771
since our little
falling out in 1912.

35:16.773 --> 35:20.025
Did you ever think
that I just need my little brother?

35:20.027 --> 35:23.028
And that's why
you can't go.

35:23.030 --> 35:25.396
It might be good
for you, Damon,

35:25.398 --> 35:27.949
but it will
destroy Stefan.

35:28.835 --> 35:31.736
For once, you need
to put someone else

35:31.738 --> 35:33.338
in front of yourself.

35:37.409 --> 35:40.128
You need
to let him go.

Good luck, brother.

36:14.297 --> 36:16.281
I didn't know
about that.

36:16.283 --> 36:19.284
Yeah. Well, next time,
I'll hang a billboard.

36:19.286 --> 36:21.920
I know it may seem like
I'm being unfair about this,

36:21.922 --> 36:24.506
like I'm upset about
losing Elena to you,

36:24.508 --> 36:28.510
and I am, but after
all this is over,

36:28.512 --> 36:30.011
if she never feels
the same way about me

36:30.013 --> 36:34.182

at least it'll be her choice.

Stefan about me and Damon.

that I'll tell him.

where to find them.

where they're buried.

war here.

they're dead

doesn't mean you can't
see them again.

completely let her go.

what he needs to do.

all he told you?

It's just...

How can you trust him?

her as much as I do.
