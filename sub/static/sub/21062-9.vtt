You've been writing
about criminal justice

12:14.510 --> 12:16.466
and mass incarceration,
but now all of a sudden

12:16.510 --> 12:18.330
you're an expert
in this disease?

12:18.380 --> 12:19.813
I've done enough research
to know it's naive

12:19.860 --> 12:21.680
to ignore the fact
that the economic havoc

12:21.740 --> 12:23.992
in our community
doesn't just keep
black people behind bars.

12:24.040 --> 12:26.736
It also puts
the most vulnerable of us

12:26.780 --> 12:28.782
at the greatest risk
of contracting this virus.

12:28.830 --> 12:30.309
No, you don't get it.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.136
People are coming in,
and they're scared.

12:32.180 --> 12:33.488
They don't know
where to turn.

12:33.530 --> 12:35.179
I understand,
they're concerned.

12:35.230 --> 12:38.529
"They're concerned"?
Nova, they are freaking out!

12:38.580 --> 12:40.400
You know what?

12:40.450 --> 12:44.841
I feel like
this is just about
being provocative.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.881
Like you're trying
to scare white folk

12:46.940 --> 12:49.545

Everything okay?

- I know who you are.

The number of Zika cases
in New Orleans is negligible.

there won't be?

What you're doing--
the second-guessing,

13:28.720 --> 13:30.756
it's not helpful.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.620
Maybe I should've
dialed back the rhetoric.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.068
It's not how I work.

13:42.950 --> 13:45.908
Is this about my role?

13:45.950 --> 13:48.077
Look, I'd be lying
ifI said that

13:48.130 --> 13:49.734
I wasn't a little worried
that my judgment

13:49.780 --> 13:53.386
might be clouded
by your intensity.

13:53.440 --> 13:54.953
Fair enough.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.479
But don't doubt
your Integrity

14:01.920 --> 14:04.093
Because I don't
doubt mine.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.740
All I want to do
is quell this--

14:07.800 --> 14:11.099
this fear
that's taking hold.

14:11.150 --> 14:14.278
You once told me that
you wanted to save lives.

14:14.330 --> 14:16.673
Okay, that's what
this is about.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.844
Don't lose sight
of that.

Working my way up,
I guess.

14:38.350 --> 14:42.878
Being away from my girls,
that was the hardest part
for me.

14:42.920 --> 14:44.478
I do miss
that check, though.

14:44.530 --> 14:46.919
Yeah, when those
oil prices fell,

- Nobody was safe.
- Company doesn't want

to give up profits,

I'm just hoping
for something permanent

my mother
and my Aunt Vi
don't mix.

34:46.380 --> 34:48.723
- Mm.
- They're like, um...

34:48.780 --> 34:51.510
Oil and vinegar?
[ chuckles ]

34:51.560 --> 34:53.642
More like
ammonia and bleach.

34:53.700 --> 34:54.826
Ooh!

34:57.610 --> 34:59.999
My mom agreed
not to come back here

35:00.050 --> 35:02.268
a long time ago.

35:02.310 --> 35:03.914
I'm not even gonna ask.

35:03.970 --> 35:05.221
[ chuckles ]

35:11.280 --> 35:13.748
You okay, chre?

35:13.800 --> 35:15.973
Do I look like
there's anything
wrong with me?

35:16.020 --> 35:17.885
Look, I'm just asking.

35:19.420 --> 35:20.933
So, I got some news.

35:23.640 --> 35:25.676
Job at the scaffolding
company,

35:25.730 --> 35:28.335
it's supposed to be
for three or so weeks.

35:28.380 --> 35:33.773
Well, they wanna give me
my own crew full time.

35:36.390 --> 35:39.257
Well, if that don't
take the cake.

35:39.310 --> 35:40.993
I ain't surprised.

35:41.050 --> 35:43.177
They see
the value in you.

35:43.220 --> 35:47.179
- You want this, right?
- Yeah.

35:47.230 --> 35:49.482
It'll help me
take better care of you,

35:49.530 --> 35:52.408
so I guess
I'm glad about it.

35:52.450 --> 35:55.271
Well, then I'm glad
right along with you.

35:59.110 --> 36:03.672
- You sure you're okay?
- Man, I am fine!

36:09.250 --> 36:11.332
Thank you
for planning this.

36:11.380 --> 36:14.338
Well, good news
deserves a party.

36:16.430 --> 36:20.389
There's been...
so much g0ing on.

36:22.090 --> 36:24.126
You're right about that.

36:24.180 --> 36:27.434
But family is family,
and now we yours.

36:29.700 --> 36:31.179
Thank you, Ms. Vi.

36:31.230 --> 36:33.926
Aunt Vi, baby.

36:35.880 --> 36:37.188
Aunt Vi.

36:42.630 --> 36:44.541
I'm happy for Rah.

36:46.330 --> 36:48.719
Me, too.

36:48.770 --> 36:50.419
Aunt Vi wants us
to sit down

36:50.460 --> 36:51.802
with Ralph Angel...

36:53.640 --> 36:57.201
figure out what to do
about the farm.

36:57.250 --> 37:00.469
- [ sighs ]
- Sis, I'm not thrilled
about it either, but...

37:03.220 --> 37:05.085
What's eating you?

37:09.830 --> 37:12.219
Something happened
to Micah.

37:16.050 --> 37:17.358
Come.

37:17.400 --> 37:21.666
From the back
ofyourhand

37:21.710 --> 37:24.440
Good omen woman

37:24.500 --> 37:27.321
Easy to see

37:27.370 --> 37:34.287
Good omen woman
and I'm all you'll need...

37:34.330 --> 37:37.629
Mom? Dad?

37:40.300 --> 37:42.336
I called because...

37:44.740 --> 37:46.514
I want you to know
that I'm getting married

37:46.560 --> 37:51.384
to my son's father,
and...

37:51.440 --> 37:53.305
I've been clean
for two years.

37:53.350 --> 37:54.829
[ sniffles ]

37:57.710 --> 37:59.917
I want you to know
that I'm good.

38:01.750 --> 38:05.754
And Blue, he's, um--
he's six.

38:07.410 --> 38:09.583
And he's so precious.

38:11.550 --> 38:13.586
He's filled
with goodness.

38:17.680 --> 38:19.807
Nothing but goodness.

38:21.770 --> 38:24.375
I, um-- I just wanted
to tell you that.

38:24.430 --> 38:26.204
[ sniffles ]

38:26.260 --> 38:29.809
And I miss you.

38:29.870 --> 38:35.217
- And I love you.
- You don't need no fire
when I'm by your side

38:35.260 --> 38:38.479
We're gonna burn
like bourbon

38:38.530 --> 38:43.001
Slowly breathe
like wine

38:44.190 --> 38:46.829
Rather walk away

38:46.880 --> 38:50.793
Let those
sleeping dogs lie...

38:50.850 --> 38:53.626
[ chatter ]

38:53.670 --> 38:55.672
[ clinking ]

38:57.770 --> 38:59.579
Ralph Angel:
What's going on, y'all?

39:01.730 --> 39:06.429
I just want to say
Darla and I, uh...

39:06.470 --> 39:09.109
appreciate y'all
being here,

39:09.170 --> 39:11.775
for all
the love and support
y'all been giving us.

39:13.260 --> 39:16.388
We've been through
ups and downs,

39:16.440 --> 39:18.863
but we here now.

39:18.920 --> 39:20.262
We love y'all.

39:21.880 --> 39:23.268
Thank you.

39:25.310 --> 39:26.572
That's all--
that's all I got.

39:26.620 --> 39:28.668
[ laughter, applause ]

39:38.460 --> 39:40.416
Charley:
This is my fault.

39:42.240 --> 39:44.322
But how could you know
that this was going to happen?

39:44.380 --> 39:46.940
But that's just it.

39:46.990 --> 39:49.948
I should've known.

39:49.990 --> 39:53.039
I spent summers here
and know how people think.

39:54.650 --> 39:57.039
And I didn't prepare him
for living in the South.

39:57.090 --> 39:58.819
I just-- I thought...

40:01.480 --> 40:03.266
I don't know
what I thought.

40:04.920 --> 40:06.911
He's smart.

40:06.960 --> 40:10.748
He'll figure it out.
He'll, uh-- he'll make it work.

40:13.190 --> 40:15.408
I didn't protect him.

40:17.240 --> 40:19.185
- Not like
how you protected me.
- [ sighs ]

40:19.240 --> 40:22.459
Isn't that what you told me
when you sent me off
to boarding school?

40:22.500 --> 40:24.411
You were protecting me.

40:27.510 --> 40:29.671
I sent you
away to school

40:29.730 --> 40:31.948
because you
were a black woman
in a white world,

40:31.990 --> 40:35.369
and you needed
the best education
and the best pedigree.

40:35.430 --> 40:37.990
It wasn't enough.

40:38.040 --> 40:41.555
And that is why
I sent you to spend
your summers here.

40:41.610 --> 40:43.566
So that you would know
where you came from

40:43.610 --> 40:46.044
and have that identity.

40:46.090 --> 40:48.399
Butthen
I had to go home.

40:51.140 --> 40:54.837
And I felt
the opposite at home.

40:54.880 --> 40:56.700
Like I had to manage
my blackness,

40:56.750 --> 41:00.572
like-- like there_was
no room for it.

41:00.630 --> 41:04.669
Like it was something
I put on a few weeks
of the year.

41:04.720 --> 41:08.019
I know-- I know
you don't understand that.

41:08.070 --> 41:09.458
Why?

41:11.420 --> 41:13.285
Because you can't.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.460
You can't understand that.

41:19.430 --> 41:20.727
Because I'm white?

41:20.780 --> 41:22.475
Is that what
you're trying to say?

41:24.650 --> 41:27.346
Well, I did the best
that I could by you,

41:27.390 --> 41:30.439
and that is
what any mother does
for their child.

41:30.480 --> 41:33.950
And that is what
you have done for Micah.

41:34.010 --> 41:36.444
And he is strong...

41:36.490 --> 41:39.709
- [ sniffles ]
- ...just like you.

41:39.750 --> 41:41.354
[crying ]

41:41.410 --> 41:44.925
[ sighs ]
Oh, honey.

41:47.370 --> 41:49.406
-Iam”.
- [ both crying ]

41:51.110 --> 41:53.101
I'm here for you now.

41:54.860 --> 41:56.851

42:04.600 --> 42:09.128
Farewell, I'm bound

To leave you,
bound

42:12.790 --> 42:17.352
Farewell, I'm bound

42:17.400 --> 42:20.699
To leave you waiting

42:20.750 --> 42:23.799
By the front door.
