00:02.120 --> 00:02.662
The trick to life

00:02.663 --> 00:05.142
is to not slip back
into old patterns.

00:05.275 --> 00:07.834
When your parents or
siblings push your buttons,

00:07.934 --> 00:10.038
don't suddenly act like
you're 10 years old again.

00:10.041 --> 00:11.850
You're an adult. You push back.

00:12.356 --> 00:15.042
You know, F. Scott Fitzgerald ends
"The Great Gatsby"

00:15.043 --> 00:15.986
with this line,

00:16.126 --> 00:18.461
"we beat on,
boats against the current,

00:18.462 --> 00:20.609
borne back ceaselessly
into the past."

00:20.610 --> 00:22.658
Well, I beg to differ.

00:22.887 --> 00:25.863
We can make headway against
the current if we try.

00:25.903 --> 00:28.063
Never stop dreaming
of a better tomorrow.

00:28.785 --> 00:31.156
This is Dr. Karl West.
Thanks for listening.

00:31.157 --> 00:32.198
Nora. Yes.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.230
I'm glad you could come in.
I just wanted

00:34.283 --> 00:36.571
to go over the details of
your photo shoot today.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.097
Your daughters are coming, right?

00:38.098 --> 00:40.887
Oh, my gosh, yes.
They're so excited. Great.

00:40.978 --> 00:42.782
This should be some
good publicity for you.

00:42.843 --> 00:44.875
Uh, I just want you to
meet the photographer.

00:49.460 --> 00:50.750
Come on. Come on. Come on, people.

00:50.761 --> 00:52.647
I need some input.
Should I get the one in the cart?

00:52.648 --> 00:54.470
It's Marc Jacobs and
it matches your eyes.

00:54.471 --> 00:56.037
What more do you
want from a handbag?

00:56.038 --> 00:57.405
Come on, come on. Click
"shoes" while you're thinking.

00:57.406 --> 01:00.167
No, you don't need shoes.
Go to "area rugs." Area rugs?

01:00.168 --> 01:02.576
Yeah. I'm sick of waking
up to your dust bunnies.

01:02.577 --> 01:05.313
Well, you could always
move home, Kevin.

01:06.037 --> 01:08.694
You know, I spoke to,
uh, Scotty yesterday.

01:08.695 --> 01:11.213
Guys, I told you.
I do not want you calling him.

01:11.214 --> 01:13.340
I did not call him.
Paige called him.

01:13.341 --> 01:16.136
Wh... She called him
because she needs help.

01:16.137 --> 01:18.330
Remember? With her
debating tournament.

01:18.524 --> 01:19.940
Oh, my God. The debate.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:19.941 --> 01:21.101
We were supposed to
help her practice today.

01:21.102 --> 01:22.660
Yeah, Kevin.
You can't let her down.

01:22.661 --> 01:24.757
She's just a kid.
She's just a kid.

01:25.166 --> 01:27.524
Sarah, she's your kid.
So why don't you help her?

01:27.525 --> 01:28.745
Because she doesn't want my help.

01:28.746 --> 01:30.821
She wants your help because you're...
you're a lawyer,

01:30.822 --> 01:34.348
and she wants Scotty's help with
what she calls "the Debuttal."

01:34.349 --> 01:35.297
She clearly needs help.

01:35.298 --> 01:38.089
Oh, damn, damn, damn! What?

01:38.090 --> 01:41.013
The... the bag sold out.
Oh, it does that sometimes.

01:41.014 --> 01:43.460
If you really want it,
you just have to click, or it's gone.

01:43.461 --> 01:45.406
What else did Scotty
have to say? Nothing,

01:45.407 --> 01:47.651
but he feels bad about things.
I-I can tell.

01:47.652 --> 01:50.597
I'm sorry. He feels bad?
What about me? Kev, Kevin...

01:50.598 --> 01:51.914
Would you please settle down?

01:51.915 --> 01:53.570
We are all here for you.
You know what?

01:53.571 --> 01:54.648
I would like to see how fast

01:54.649 --> 01:57.626
Sarah would talk to Luc if
he cheated. It's mom. Luc...

01:57.627 --> 02:00.506
Go for it. Okay, but no more
talk of Scotty. Hi, mom.

02:00.528 --> 02:02.610
Kevin? I thought I called Kitty.

02:02.686 --> 02:03.667
You are. Hang on.

02:04.684 --> 02:07.090
You're on speaker with me,
the shopping twins, and Evan.

02:07.091 --> 02:10.100
Hi, mom. Well, it's after
10:00 in the morning.

02:10.101 --> 02:12.883
What are you guys doing there? Oh,
my God, mom.

02:12.884 --> 02:15.441
There is the most
amazing sale online.

02:15.442 --> 02:17.354
Do you happen to need
any accessories at all?

02:17.355 --> 02:19.929
There are some incredible
bargains to be found

02:19.930 --> 02:22.325
in the area of handbags
right now. Yeah.

02:22.373 --> 02:24.427
Online blowout sales?

02:24.428 --> 02:27.522
Is... is that what your lives
have been reduced to?

02:27.746 --> 02:30.324
What? Don't forget about
the photo shoot today.

02:30.365 --> 02:32.404
It's to publicize my show,
"dear mom,"

02:32.405 --> 02:34.575
surrounded with her
loving daughters,

02:34.576 --> 02:36.448
so be here at 4:00.

02:36.449 --> 02:39.527
No later, no excuses.
And, Kevin...

02:39.650 --> 02:41.786
You can't spend the
rest of your life

02:41.787 --> 02:43.979
sleeping on your sister's sofa.

02:44.207 --> 02:46.447
I-I spoke with Scotty yesterday.

02:46.483 --> 02:48.063
You, too? Why?

02:48.064 --> 02:50.912
I needed a recipe. That is such...

02:50.913 --> 02:53.490
Ooh! I-it's my producer. Hang on.

02:55.282 --> 02:56.944
At least you haven't
spoken to Scotty.

02:57.881 --> 02:58.633
Hey.

02:58.998 --> 03:02.416
Oh, my God. What is wrong with you? Well,
he called me, Kevin.

03:02.417 --> 03:04.751
He just wanted to make sure
that you had enough blankets.

03:04.752 --> 03:07.180
You know what? This isn't
some little spat we're having.

03:07.206 --> 03:09.110
Okay? He was unfaithful to me.

03:09.457 --> 03:10.402
I'm back.

03:10.440 --> 03:14.313
And, Kevin, listen, honestly,
I'm not trying to butt in.

03:14.389 --> 03:15.928
Yes, you are. All of you are.

03:15.929 --> 03:17.396
Look, I know you
want this to work,

03:17.397 --> 03:18.873
but that is up to me,
okay? Okay, okay. Sorry.

03:18.874 --> 03:21.508
Okay, fine. I'm sorry.
I'm gonna go to work,

03:21.509 --> 03:24.108
and, yes, I will help Paige with
her debate. Well, you better.

03:24.109 --> 03:24.940
Thank you.

03:26.646 --> 03:28.304
Is he gone? Yes.

03:28.305 --> 03:30.901
All right, girls, tell me,
on a scale from one to ten,

03:30.902 --> 03:33.013
what are the chances of
them getting back together?

03:33.014 --> 03:35.971
Six. Five and a half.
I'm the Russian judge.

03:35.972 --> 03:38.016
Oh, God. That's so depressing.

03:38.017 --> 03:38.940
Check this out.

03:38.941 --> 03:44.435
There is this like new ladies
tweed fall suit, size 8.

03:44.436 --> 03:47.403
What do you think? Oh, Sarah.
It must be so wonderful for you

03:47.404 --> 03:49.084
to be able to lounge
around all day

03:49.085 --> 03:50.857
and not have to worry
about silly little things

03:50.858 --> 03:52.376
like getting a job.

03:53.344 --> 03:54.321
I've gotta go.

03:54.845 --> 03:56.212
Uh, I'll see you at 4:00.

03:56.213 --> 03:57.557
Bye. Okay, bye-bye.

04:02.811 --> 04:04.772
Hello. Oh, hi.

04:04.773 --> 04:06.277
Would you care for some? Yes,
thank you.

04:07.170 --> 04:08.866
You're Dr. west.

04:08.942 --> 04:10.857
Oh, Karl. Karl, please.

04:12.757 --> 04:13.963
I'm Nora Walker. Nora Walker.

04:13.964 --> 04:17.677
Yes. Yes, I'm... I'm... I'm
practically a card-carrying member

04:17.781 --> 04:18.623
of your fan club.

04:18.624 --> 04:19.712
No, you're not. Yes.

04:19.713 --> 04:21.353
No, you're not. Yes.

04:21.353 --> 04:23.114
Oh, my gosh. I mean, I just...

04:23.125 --> 04:25.176
I just have a talking
advice column.

04:25.177 --> 04:28.506
But you really,
honestly help your callers.

04:28.612 --> 04:31.845
As far as I'm concerned,
you're it.

04:32.924 --> 04:34.361
Well, I-I've never been

04:34.585 --> 04:36.008
quite so happy

04:36.085 --> 04:39.668
being referred to as a
gender-neutral pronoun.

04:40.817 --> 04:43.393
Well, I... I get more articulate.

04:44.259 --> 04:46.217
Well, I'm... I'm...
I'm sure you're busy, and...

04:46.218 --> 04:48.808
Actually, I do have to go,
but, uh, I hope to see you

04:48.809 --> 04:51.769
around our little
studio again... soon.

04:52.665 --> 04:54.649
Soon... again.

04:58.470 --> 04:59.461
Oh, dear.

05:00.061 --> 05:01.452
Ah, look at this.

05:01.453 --> 05:03.776
Alicia and jerkface
getting divorced.

05:03.777 --> 05:04.882
Never liked him.

05:08.521 --> 05:10.073
Kitty, this is pathetic.

05:10.280 --> 05:10.922
Mom's right.

05:10.923 --> 05:13.693
I've gotta get my act
together and get back to...

05:14.023 --> 05:15.851
Work. Yes, work.

05:15.852 --> 05:17.313
I've been thinking
about the same thing.

05:17.314 --> 05:19.432
This is ridiculous.
My... my baby's asleep,

05:19.433 --> 05:21.791
and I'm sitting here reading
celebrity magazines?

05:21.792 --> 05:25.057
Don't you be too hard on yourself.
You do have a job.

05:25.441 --> 05:27.636
You're a single mom.
Evan's only 3 years old.

05:27.637 --> 05:28.830
I'm in "freaky Friday."

05:28.831 --> 05:30.672
My mom's a hotshot career woman

05:30.673 --> 05:32.316
with her finger on the
"hold" button,

05:32.317 --> 05:35.645
and I'm just...
I'm stuck in neutral.

05:35.665 --> 05:37.118
What's holding you back?

05:39.106 --> 05:39.987
Oh, God.

05:39.988 --> 05:42.772
You know, I'm sitting on
tens of millions of dollars

05:42.773 --> 05:44.084
and trying to find
the right company

05:44.085 --> 05:45.974
to buy into or buy out.

05:47.043 --> 05:49.704
What if I make a mistake? It's...
it's just huge.

05:49.705 --> 05:51.625
I'm... I'm not used to
working by myself.

05:52.142 --> 05:53.092
Well, wait. Wait.

05:53.118 --> 05:55.183
Why don't we work together?

05:55.761 --> 05:58.876
You said that you're choosing
from hundreds of companies.

05:58.877 --> 06:01.384
Well, no. I mean,
I-I have a short list.

06:01.421 --> 06:03.964
I've whittled it down.
Well, maybe if we worked on it together,

06:03.965 --> 06:05.565
it wouldn't be so overwhelming.

06:05.566 --> 06:08.828
Maybe it would actually
be kind of fun.

06:08.829 --> 06:12.148
Really? You'd want to do that? Yeah,
really. I want to whittle.

06:12.149 --> 06:14.376
I-I would love to whittle.
I need to whittle.

06:14.377 --> 06:17.003
My brain is mush.
Okay. Good, good.

06:17.004 --> 06:20.109
Let's get started.
Let's... let's do it. Okay. Let's.

06:20.506 --> 06:22.093
I'm serious, Justin.

06:22.094 --> 06:24.077
You don't need to wait.

06:24.262 --> 06:26.384
I mean, Dr.
Taylor can take forever,

06:26.385 --> 06:27.640
and I'll just grab a cab.

06:27.641 --> 06:30.688
I can remember where I live.
No, you know, I'm fine.

06:30.689 --> 06:31.908
I'll just wait in
the waiting room.

06:31.909 --> 06:34.885
They have a five-star
vending machine. Oh.

06:35.401 --> 06:37.497
Oh, hey. Hi. Perfect timing.

06:37.541 --> 06:38.964
Holly, the doctor's
actually ready for you.

06:38.965 --> 06:40.089
Oh, thanks, Annie.

06:40.090 --> 06:42.643
Um, I'll just do it as
quick as I can, okay?

06:42.644 --> 06:45.940
And you two stay out trouble.
Just the driver.

06:46.255 --> 06:49.598
So limo duty again, huh? Yes, yes.

06:49.662 --> 06:51.245
Well, it's very nice of you.

06:52.432 --> 06:54.082
You know, the doctor actually says

06:54.750 --> 06:56.288
that these sessions
are really helping

06:56.297 --> 06:58.213
with her memory restoration.
Yeah, yeah.

06:58.701 --> 07:00.142
Unfortunately, I think we're in

07:00.162 --> 07:02.000
the sheetrock and plaster phase.

07:02.007 --> 07:03.175
Mm. She's got a long way to go.

07:04.023 --> 07:07.000
You know, I never asked,
what's your connection to her?

07:07.133 --> 07:10.318
Are you guys related or...
I'm a friend of the family.

07:10.506 --> 07:11.429
Really? Yeah.

07:11.430 --> 07:14.230
Wow. Well, that's the kind of
friend we'd all like to have.

07:15.469 --> 07:18.781
So divorced? Or married
and allergic to gold?

07:19.433 --> 07:20.168
Tan line.

07:20.947 --> 07:21.968
Tan l... Oh.

07:21.969 --> 07:25.040
Um... yeah, I was... I was married.

07:25.097 --> 07:26.234
Was.

07:26.486 --> 07:29.405
Are you sure you don't just
take that off for my benefit?

07:29.406 --> 07:31.117
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'm sure.

07:31.634 --> 07:34.942
The titanium tongue stud I
take out for your benefit.

07:34.985 --> 07:36.660
I think I'm allergic, actually.
My tongue swells up,

07:36.661 --> 07:38.868
and I can't talk. It's weird.

07:38.886 --> 07:41.815
Listen, my schedule's
pretty screwy, but, um,

07:42.241 --> 07:44.656
if you ever want to...
Catch a movie

07:44.657 --> 07:46.065
or I don't know...

07:46.568 --> 07:48.268
Uh, uh, c-coffee.

07:48.269 --> 07:50.542
Coffee sounds great.
What time do you get off today?

07:51.174 --> 07:52.173
How about 4:00?

07:52.348 --> 07:53.325
00 it is.

07:53.641 --> 07:54.876
Great. All right.

07:54.877 --> 07:55.661
Okay.

08:01.868 --> 08:02.669
Hi.

08:02.729 --> 08:03.545
Hi.

08:06.226 --> 08:08.981
Um... y-you know Paige
is coming over...

08:09.008 --> 08:10.581
To prep for her debate
tournament. I know.

08:10.582 --> 08:11.695
She called me to make sure that

08:11.696 --> 08:13.831
I was g... Here to help.
Yeah, I know that, too.

08:13.832 --> 08:16.409
I also know you spoke with
mom and Kitty. Kevin...

08:16.849 --> 08:19.281
Look, I'm feeling kind of weird

08:19.290 --> 08:20.696
about us both working
with Paige today,

08:20.697 --> 08:22.555
so maybe you could find
an excuse not to be here.

08:22.556 --> 08:26.029
No. No, you can't stop
me from helping my niece.

08:26.073 --> 08:27.975
I'm her uncle, too. Last time I checked,
we're still married.

08:27.976 --> 08:28.578
Maybe you should've thought

08:28.579 --> 08:30.753
of that before you cheated.
Yes, I should have.

08:31.422 --> 08:33.109
And if you can't see how
much I regret that...

08:33.110 --> 08:35.365
I don't want to get into this now.
Okay. Well, when do you?

08:35.366 --> 08:37.813
Because I don't know how many
more times I can apologize

08:38.089 --> 08:39.304
or watch you come and
go to your office,

08:39.306 --> 08:40.395
completely ignoring me.

08:40.397 --> 08:42.751
Every time I look at you,
I imagine what happened,

08:42.753 --> 08:44.255
and I can't forgive you.
We have to talk,

08:44.256 --> 08:45.996
Kevin. We have to find
a way through this.

08:45.997 --> 08:49.139
I don't know if there is a
way through this. Paige.

08:49.140 --> 08:50.596
Hi. Hi.

08:52.000 --> 08:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:00.529 --> 09:03.169
So, uh, so what, did mom just
drop you off and then leave?

09:03.799 --> 09:07.798
Uh, no, actually, uh,
grandma took me. Grandma?

09:07.858 --> 09:11.008
Yeah, she told my mom she
wanted to see you guys.

09:11.498 --> 09:12.108
Isn't it amazing

09:12.109 --> 09:14.830
how grandma always manages
to find time for everything?

09:16.525 --> 09:18.914
Hi. Sorry. I couldn't...
I couldn't find a place to park.

09:18.915 --> 09:19.954
Hi. Hi.

09:20.063 --> 09:22.621
Well, I hadn't seen you
guys in quite some time,

09:22.622 --> 09:24.499
so I told Sarah that I would

09:24.500 --> 09:26.519
really love to bring
Paige over. We heard.

09:26.710 --> 09:27.478
Oh.

09:28.187 --> 09:31.529
She is really looking forward
to the two of you helping her.

09:31.530 --> 09:33.756
Well, something came
up for Scotty, so...

09:33.757 --> 09:37.035
Oh, you mean you can't stay? It...
You know, it's okay.

09:37.036 --> 09:38.577
Kevin's really good
at debating, so...

09:38.578 --> 09:41.566
But you said you'd be the
opposing side. You promised.

09:41.567 --> 09:43.997
I know. I'm so sorry, Paige.

09:43.998 --> 09:46.912
Scotty, if... if it means
this much to Paige,

09:46.913 --> 09:50.226
I'm sure you could reschedule
whatever it is you're doing.

09:54.501 --> 09:56.309
You think you could, Scotty?

09:57.334 --> 09:59.429
I suppose I could, Kevin.

09:59.634 --> 10:02.001
Okay. Well,
then we'll both help you.

10:02.002 --> 10:02.978
Yay.

10:06.805 --> 10:07.925
Hi. Hi.

10:10.214 --> 10:13.003
Paige doesn't want any...
any mayonnaise on her sandwich.

10:13.004 --> 10:13.835
Okay.

10:15.293 --> 10:16.893
I feel like I've
crossed enemy lines

10:16.894 --> 10:18.882
just by standing in here with you.

10:18.883 --> 10:21.105
Yeah, well... apparently you have.

10:21.106 --> 10:21.873
Yeah.

10:24.371 --> 10:26.322
You know the hardest
thing about all this?

10:27.706 --> 10:28.941
Is what happened that night

10:28.942 --> 10:31.054
was about so much
more than cheating.

10:32.509 --> 10:34.213
But no matter what I felt,
it doesn't matter,

10:34.214 --> 10:35.742
because I did what I did, and...

10:36.778 --> 10:37.689
And what?

10:40.613 --> 10:43.582
Scotty, Kevin told
me about that night

10:43.583 --> 10:46.072
and why he didn't show up
to the restaurant opening.

10:46.073 --> 10:48.925
That's my point. I had a
legitimate reason to be upset,

10:48.926 --> 10:50.154
but instead of telling him...

10:52.721 --> 10:53.329
Forget it.

10:53.330 --> 10:55.791
No, don't forget it.
Don't forget it.

10:55.792 --> 10:57.496
Tell him now.
Tell him everything...

10:57.549 --> 10:59.588
Everything you felt then,
everything you feel now.

10:59.589 --> 11:00.997
That's the only way.

11:03.234 --> 11:04.545
I've lost my right to.

11:05.642 --> 11:08.400
Oh, I have never
been this indecisive.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.372
Oh, wait a minute. Here we go.
This is it. Hmm?

11:10.373 --> 11:12.054
Ah, look at that.
Baby green jeans. No.

11:12.055 --> 11:15.322
We love babies. My kids are too old.
Don't you think it's weird

11:15.323 --> 11:18.278
when babyless people are
obsessed with baby stuff?

11:18.279 --> 11:19.491
No, I don't think it's weird

11:19.505 --> 11:21.903
as long as it makes money.
They're weird.

11:22.395 --> 11:24.288
I keep coming back to
this one, actually.

11:24.289 --> 11:25.442
It's a media company.

11:26.105 --> 11:27.713
A media company? Really?

11:27.714 --> 11:28.958
It's kind of like
a holding company.

11:28.959 --> 11:32.245
It's got interests in
local newspapers, radio.

11:32.246 --> 11:33.782
Sarah, this is right up my alley.

11:33.783 --> 11:36.450
I'm a communications director.
I mean, think about it.

11:36.715 --> 11:39.982
With your business savvy and
my experience in politics,

11:39.983 --> 11:42.895
we... we could
really make this fly.

11:43.519 --> 11:45.095
Wait. Kitty, are you saying

11:45.096 --> 11:48.105
that you actually want
to run this with me?

11:48.305 --> 11:50.355
Yeah. No, Sarah,
I meant it when I said it.

11:50.356 --> 11:51.847
I-I really want to help you.

11:51.848 --> 11:54.887
I thought you meant you'd help,
like, whittle.

11:55.048 --> 11:55.943
Well...

11:56.087 --> 11:59.494
It's just, you've never shown
any interest in business before.

11:59.596 --> 12:00.514
What are you talking about?

12:00.515 --> 12:01.982
I have... I have directed a staff.

12:01.983 --> 12:03.322
I've marketed myself.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.254
You know, politics is
based in business theory.

12:06.255 --> 12:07.218
Exactly, theory.

12:07.219 --> 12:09.826
And when it comes to theory,
you're all over it.

12:09.978 --> 12:13.482
You know, I came up with a
very good business idea once.

12:13.671 --> 12:14.439
When?

12:14.462 --> 12:16.191
In college. What?

12:16.587 --> 12:18.125
Magnetic poetry.

12:18.126 --> 12:20.527
You invented magnetic poetry?

12:20.551 --> 12:22.770
Yes. Yeah, well, no.
I thought of it,

12:22.771 --> 12:25.346
and then some other guy did it,
you know, like a year later...

12:25.347 --> 12:28.309
Exactly. You see?
Everyone has ideas.

12:28.462 --> 12:32.297
It's realizing the ideas to
profit that's the challenge.

12:32.298 --> 12:34.338
Yeah, and that's exactly
what I would've done

12:34.339 --> 12:36.335
if mom and dad had
given me a loan.

12:36.419 --> 12:37.651
Why didn't they?

12:37.781 --> 12:39.532
I don't know.
It wasn't dad. It was mom.

12:39.533 --> 12:40.578
And she kept on saying,

12:40.579 --> 12:43.107
"oh, you're on your way
to accomplishing so much,

12:43.108 --> 12:45.847
and business is Sarah's thing,"

12:45.848 --> 12:49.111
and blah, blah, blah. Wait.
Mom said business was my "thing"?

12:49.532 --> 12:50.846
Sarah, the point is...

12:50.847 --> 12:52.383
As in my only thing?

12:52.392 --> 12:55.570
No. I don't think she
used the word "only."

12:55.571 --> 12:56.691
But that's what she meant.

12:57.809 --> 12:58.656
She, uh...

12:59.089 --> 13:00.979
She was afraid that
you would outshine me

13:00.980 --> 13:02.596
at the one "thing"...

13:03.593 --> 13:05.093
That she thought I could do well.

13:05.094 --> 13:08.277
Oh, my God. Sarah, Sarah,
that is ridiculous.

13:08.278 --> 13:10.226
That... No, that is
not what she meant.

13:10.227 --> 13:12.319
Listen, I'm gonna go out
and run some errands.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.790
Wait a minute, Sarah.
You are overreacting.

13:14.791 --> 13:16.284
She... this... this...
it just came out wrong.

13:16.285 --> 13:18.351
See you at the photo shoot. Oh.

13:19.122 --> 13:22.078
And then when Dr.
Taylor mentioned Walker landing,

13:22.079 --> 13:25.335
I-I suddenly had this vivid
picture of my office.

13:25.336 --> 13:26.775
Wow. Oh, tell him about the,
uh, the paperweight.

13:26.776 --> 13:29.807
Oh, yeah. I could even see
the crystal paperweight

13:29.808 --> 13:31.788
that I used to keep on
the edge of my desk.

13:31.789 --> 13:33.084
Wow. That's amazing.

13:33.595 --> 13:36.438
Um, oh, look,
have you seen my keys?

13:36.439 --> 13:38.165
You know, I-I'm late for work.

13:38.166 --> 13:40.206
I'm already two days
behind on this commercial.

13:40.207 --> 13:44.187
Okay. Never mind.
Um, thanks, Justin.

13:44.188 --> 13:45.230
I really appreciate it.

13:45.231 --> 13:45.713
Oh...

13:45.714 --> 13:48.288
I'm... I'm just gonna go lie
down for a little bit.

13:48.324 --> 13:49.028
Yeah.

13:53.038 --> 13:54.143
David, what's going on?

13:55.043 --> 13:56.035
What are you talking about?

13:56.157 --> 13:57.959
You didn't even care
about holly's news.

13:57.963 --> 14:00.476
It's not the first memory
I've heard about, Justin.

14:01.663 --> 14:03.007
David, look me in the eye.

14:04.025 --> 14:04.728
What?

14:06.128 --> 14:08.914
What's going on?
It's called stress, man.

14:08.915 --> 14:10.058
You know, I've got
a lot on my plate.

14:10.059 --> 14:11.208
I think you're high.

14:13.573 --> 14:15.096
Screw you, Justin.

14:15.234 --> 14:16.099
David.

14:17.247 --> 14:18.031
David.

14:20.310 --> 14:21.544
Is everything all right?

14:22.916 --> 14:24.851
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Everything's fine.

14:34.004 --> 14:37.448
Mom. Sarah. For God sakes,
I could've been naked.

14:37.449 --> 14:39.186
Sorry. I'm glad you're not.

14:39.187 --> 14:42.114
Listen, I need to talk to
you about something. What?

14:42.758 --> 14:43.879
Did you tell Kitty...

14:45.698 --> 14:47.972
That business is the
only thing that I can do?

14:48.904 --> 14:49.657
What?

14:49.735 --> 14:51.000
Magnetic poetry.

14:51.515 --> 14:53.567
Did you and dad not give her a
loan because you were afraid

14:53.568 --> 14:55.520
that she would outshine
me as a businesswoman?

14:56.520 --> 14:59.030
I-I remember Kitty
being fixated...

14:59.031 --> 15:00.053
Did you... with magnets.

15:00.054 --> 15:01.802
Or did you not? I don't...
I don't remember a plan.

15:01.803 --> 15:03.674
And, you know, I... mom, did you...

15:03.675 --> 15:06.694
I gotta see who this is.
Mom, your publicist can wait.

15:07.032 --> 15:09.026
Um, hello?

15:09.027 --> 15:11.626
Mom, I've been calling you for,
like, an hour.

15:11.627 --> 15:13.658
Do you not answer
your phone anymore?

15:13.927 --> 15:16.454
This is really not a good time.

15:16.643 --> 15:18.325
Don't get mad, but I think

15:18.326 --> 15:21.627
I may have said something
to Sarah that I...

15:21.755 --> 15:23.690
Ugh... I shouldn't have said.

15:23.691 --> 15:27.529
Uh-huh. Yes, well, Dr. Schenk,

15:27.530 --> 15:29.865
I-I do wish those
x-rays of my molars

15:29.866 --> 15:31.579
would've remained confidential.

15:31.663 --> 15:34.330
Oh, my God.
She's there, isn't she?

15:34.331 --> 15:36.235
Uh-huh. Is she mad?

15:36.328 --> 15:38.167
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

15:38.558 --> 15:41.577
There is a lot of
sensitivity in that area.

15:41.578 --> 15:43.929
I guess I'm just gonna have
to deal with it now, aren't I?

15:43.930 --> 15:46.763
Oh, mom, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. Listen.

15:46.794 --> 15:49.253
It's just that we... we started
talking about business, and...

15:49.254 --> 15:50.877
you know, this is
really not a good time.

15:50.878 --> 15:52.746
So thank you so much for calling.

15:52.747 --> 15:54.746
Deny you said it.
There's no paper tr...

15:55.414 --> 15:57.782
so, mom, you were explaining...

15:58.375 --> 15:59.751
Sarah, God,

16:00.287 --> 16:02.303
this happened over 20 years ago.

16:03.260 --> 16:04.026
Did you really think

16:04.027 --> 16:05.761
that my self-esteem was so fragile

16:05.762 --> 16:07.998
that you needed to protect
me from my own sister?

16:07.999 --> 16:11.126
No. Kitty was a flibbertigibbet.

16:11.127 --> 16:13.527
I had to keep her
focused on her goals.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.298
Why, so she wouldn't
threaten mine?

16:15.779 --> 16:19.507
I mean, did I pale in
comparison to Kitty that much?

16:19.852 --> 16:21.515
Sarah, this wasn't about you.

16:21.535 --> 16:23.822
Kitty had her own set of problems.

16:23.823 --> 16:25.999
She was terribly insecure.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.773
She wanted everyone's approval,

16:27.774 --> 16:29.951
especially her father's and men.

16:30.035 --> 16:32.037
Do you wonder why she
went into politics?

16:32.038 --> 16:34.609
Because she was so
shiny and popular. No.

16:34.610 --> 16:36.522
If you think I influenced Kitty

16:36.523 --> 16:38.150
to stay away from
a business career

16:38.151 --> 16:40.552
to protect you,
you couldn't be more wrong.

16:42.166 --> 16:43.053
I don't believe you.

16:43.054 --> 16:44.094
Sarah! Mnh-mnh.

16:44.149 --> 16:45.906
Just stop badgering me with
all your career advice.

16:45.907 --> 16:48.930
I am not badgering you.
I'm trying to help you move on.

16:48.931 --> 16:50.602
Then just stop it.
Okay? Just stop.

16:50.603 --> 16:51.990
Because if you hadn't
called this morning,

16:51.991 --> 16:53.426
none of this would've happened,

16:53.427 --> 16:55.682
and I would have a
like new tweed suit.

16:57.787 --> 16:59.789
Okay, uh, Chris,
go... go to the, uh,

16:59.790 --> 17:02.906
the shot of the wheel now.
Come on, come... no, no, no, no.

17:02.907 --> 17:04.906
Not that... the one...
the one from the front.

17:05.155 --> 17:07.394
Yeah, now I specifically
told you, I wanna...

17:07.884 --> 17:09.258
Just... just find it.

17:10.734 --> 17:12.182
Not now. I'm on deadline.

17:12.183 --> 17:13.432
David, I need to talk to you.

17:18.035 --> 17:20.078
Are you crazy? I'm working.
You can't just come in here...

17:20.079 --> 17:21.301
look, I don't care
if you're working.

17:21.303 --> 17:22.502
Holly's more important.

17:24.943 --> 17:26.303
Chris, can you give us a minute?

17:33.452 --> 17:34.363
Look...

17:34.427 --> 17:36.763
If holly's ever gonna recover,
she needs your help.

17:37.291 --> 17:39.115
And you can't help
her if you're using.

17:46.872 --> 17:48.434
You know, I worked so hard

17:48.435 --> 17:49.987
to get her to forget
about William,

17:50.748 --> 17:53.455
and then when I finally
believed that she loved me,

17:53.456 --> 17:54.959
that she wanted to be with me...

17:56.919 --> 17:58.888
I-I got her an engagement ring.

18:00.116 --> 18:02.689
And a month later,
the accident happened,

18:03.691 --> 18:04.970
and she disappeared.

18:04.971 --> 18:09.048
You know, she doesn't remember
how she felt about me.

18:09.049 --> 18:10.871
She doesn't remember
being engaged.

18:10.872 --> 18:12.839
She, uh, she was just gone.

18:13.514 --> 18:16.082
Look, David, I-I know...
What it feels like

18:16.083 --> 18:17.807
when the person you love vanishes.

18:18.675 --> 18:20.218
But, David,
Rebecca's actually gone,

18:20.219 --> 18:21.355
and holly's still here.

18:22.211 --> 18:23.667
And she needs your help, man.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.246
Look, let me... let me
take you to a meeting.

18:28.247 --> 18:28.951
I'll drive.

18:30.686 --> 18:32.362
Okay. All right. Thanks.

18:32.363 --> 18:34.154
Uh, can you meet me at
the house in an hour?

18:34.978 --> 18:35.811
I'll be there.

18:37.039 --> 18:37.872
Thank you.

18:40.956 --> 18:41.977
Noradrenaline.

18:43.347 --> 18:45.091
Uh, it's your new nickname.

18:45.327 --> 18:47.646
Yeah, believe it or not,
it is the approved name

18:47.647 --> 18:51.664
for the hormone that causes our
fight-or-flight response. Really?

18:51.807 --> 18:53.306
Really. Yeah, it really is a word.

18:53.307 --> 18:54.692
I mean, I can show
you in my office

18:54.693 --> 18:57.785
in the dictionary. Oh, no.
Well, thank you anyway.

18:57.786 --> 18:59.549
I have to go do the photo thing.

18:59.712 --> 19:01.504
Oh, right. Yeah.
I just came from mine.

19:02.015 --> 19:03.887
Reminds me of why
I'm on the radio.

19:04.395 --> 19:07.675
Uh, cameras are... well,
they're so traumatizing, I...

19:07.771 --> 19:10.091
I-I can't picture you traumatized.

19:10.154 --> 19:13.163
I can't picture you picturing me.

19:14.323 --> 19:15.102
Well, it's...

19:15.103 --> 19:17.965
it's not like I sit
around picturing you.

19:17.966 --> 19:19.590
I mean, I've got thoughts,
worries.

19:19.591 --> 19:22.199
I worry all the time.
What do you worry about?

19:22.417 --> 19:23.744
My kids, of course.

19:23.776 --> 19:25.610
Children... you know how it is.

19:25.775 --> 19:27.759
Take my daughters, please.

19:27.943 --> 19:29.813
One minute I'm worried
that they're slouches,

19:29.814 --> 19:31.670
and what the hell are they
doing with their lives,

19:31.671 --> 19:33.110
and then the next minute,
I'm worried

19:33.111 --> 19:35.155
because they seem to
be going at each other,

19:35.167 --> 19:38.093
dredging up things I
said to 'em 20 years ago.

19:38.094 --> 19:40.882
And then there's my son Kevin
with the marital problems,

19:40.883 --> 19:43.329
and oh, my God,
it's not getting any better.

19:43.330 --> 19:45.645
And they're all yelling
at me to butt out,

19:45.646 --> 19:47.381
and that's the thing
with children...

19:47.382 --> 19:49.325
they always tell you to go away.

19:49.326 --> 19:51.896
And then they all fall
down and skin their knees,

19:51.897 --> 19:54.844
and I'm standing there with, like,
one crummy little bandage,

19:54.845 --> 19:58.813
going "oh, my God! How in heaven
can I ever stop the bleeding?"

19:58.873 --> 20:00.601
Well, put down the bandage.

20:01.616 --> 20:02.921
What do you mean,
"put down the bandage"?

20:02.922 --> 20:05.019
Just put down the bandage.

20:05.483 --> 20:07.647
But there are bleeding children.

20:07.648 --> 20:09.894
Why... why would I put
down the bandage?

20:09.895 --> 20:11.969
Because it's not
your responsibility.

20:11.970 --> 20:14.266
I mean, you've started a new job.

20:14.267 --> 20:16.322
You feel guilty for
your children's failures

20:16.323 --> 20:18.318
because you no longer have
what you consider to be

20:18.319 --> 20:19.566
ample time to help them. Oh,

20:19.567 --> 20:21.982
failures? I never said
anything about failure.

20:21.983 --> 20:23.760
That you think you have the power

20:24.530 --> 20:27.160
to fix all their problems...
that's... that's unrealistic.

20:27.161 --> 20:29.051
Wait a minute.
Do you even have children?

20:29.211 --> 20:30.668
No, I don't have children.

20:31.763 --> 20:33.636
And there you have it.

20:34.144 --> 20:34.943
God.

20:36.288 --> 20:38.954
Okay, Paige, you're the
affirmative speaker,

20:38.955 --> 20:40.139
so you go first.

20:40.260 --> 20:42.982
Okay. So I'm saying

20:42.983 --> 20:46.138
that detention serves a
satisfactory purpose.

20:46.139 --> 20:48.794
Wait. Say, "resolved,
" then state your proposition.

20:48.795 --> 20:50.285
That's how you start a debate.

20:50.286 --> 20:51.830
Mm. Actually her school rules

20:51.831 --> 20:53.239
don't say anything about
"resolved."

20:53.240 --> 20:55.028
She's just supposed to
state the proposition.

20:55.029 --> 20:57.543
You read the rules?
That's so sweet.

20:57.997 --> 21:00.273
Isn't that really sweet? Okay.
My bad. Start again.

21:00.274 --> 21:02.179
But I like resolved. It's cool.

21:02.607 --> 21:03.853
So resolved...

21:03.854 --> 21:06.018
one of the ways detention
serves a purpose

21:06.019 --> 21:08.359
is it shows students
that there can be

21:08.360 --> 21:09.928
consequences for their actions.

21:09.966 --> 21:12.137
Good. Consequences
for their actions...

21:12.138 --> 21:13.850
Good, solid first point.

21:13.851 --> 21:16.509
Detention teaches kids that
when they do something wrong,

21:16.510 --> 21:18.575
they have to take
responsibility for it.

21:18.576 --> 21:20.995
Excellent point,
one so many people overlook.

21:20.996 --> 21:23.285
Kevin, I thought we were trying
to stick to the task at hand.

21:24.099 --> 21:25.925
Do you want to rebut? Yes.

21:26.327 --> 21:28.854
Resolved... Sometimes detention
doesn't serve a purpose.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.997
Why is that? Okay, because...

21:31.991 --> 21:34.231
Well, you know, let's say
Johnny does something bad,

21:34.232 --> 21:36.553
so principal Smith
puts him in detention.

21:36.692 --> 21:38.930
So now he's sitting
there alone, stewing.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.106
Things are getting worse.

21:40.107 --> 21:43.259
What principal Smith should
do is talk to Johnny.

21:43.269 --> 21:46.772
What if, say, Johnny cheated...
On an exam?

21:47.191 --> 21:49.343
Are you saying principal Smith
should have a heart-to-heart

21:49.344 --> 21:49.974
with the kid?

21:49.975 --> 21:52.894
Yes, because talking about
a problem is way better

21:52.895 --> 21:55.359
than icing Johnny out
in some cold classroom.

21:55.422 --> 21:58.044
Plus, what if Johnny really
loves principal Smith?

21:58.045 --> 21:59.279
Okay, Paige,
I know what you're doing.

21:59.280 --> 22:02.527
It is not appropriate.
Then break up. See if I care.

22:02.779 --> 22:04.556
Scotty, will you
please take me home?

22:16.695 --> 22:17.622
David.

22:18.571 --> 22:19.386
Annie.

22:19.963 --> 22:20.763
Hi.

22:21.273 --> 22:23.830
Uh, I thought you were
supposed to go out of town.

22:23.831 --> 22:26.963
I... that was you on my voice mail

22:26.964 --> 22:28.250
canceling our date, right?

22:28.251 --> 22:30.518
I mean, I don't think I
know two Justin walkers.

22:30.519 --> 22:33.495
No. Um, yeah, it was... it was me.

22:33.527 --> 22:35.351
I-I thought I had
to go out of town.

22:35.851 --> 22:37.960
What are you doing here?
David's going through something,

22:37.966 --> 22:40.110
so I figured I'd come
over and help him out.

22:41.011 --> 22:42.929
Wow. I gotta ask.

22:43.571 --> 22:47.235
You seem like you are one
hell of a family friend.

22:47.692 --> 22:48.683
Do you owe them money?

22:49.051 --> 22:51.114
Do they have incriminating
photos of you?

22:51.115 --> 22:52.139
No, no, no.

22:52.663 --> 22:56.487
Justin, listen, I don't mind
you canceling on our date.

22:56.820 --> 22:57.362
I really don't.

22:57.363 --> 22:59.059
But you didn't have to lie to me.

23:02.931 --> 23:04.450
Uh, Annie, um...

23:06.535 --> 23:08.119
I was married to their daughter.

23:08.615 --> 23:10.055
So that's...

23:10.642 --> 23:11.939
Oh. Uh...

23:13.413 --> 23:14.901
Well, that makes sense.

23:16.367 --> 23:18.762
Uh, so Dr.
Taylor actually asked me

23:18.763 --> 23:20.998
to give these memory
aids to holly.

23:20.999 --> 23:23.790
Will you just tell her I said good-bye?
Yeah, Annie, look, just...

23:23.791 --> 23:26.031
No. No, no, no.
It's... Justin, it's no biggie.

23:26.242 --> 23:28.530
You're not ready to separate.
I get it.

23:29.756 --> 23:30.474
Annie...

23:34.175 --> 23:35.088
Paige.

23:35.702 --> 23:36.663
Sarah.

23:38.707 --> 23:39.603
Anyone.

23:39.999 --> 23:40.894
Hello.

23:45.251 --> 23:48.086
Fancy seeing you here.
I swear, I'm not stalking you.

23:48.087 --> 23:51.138
Paige called me and asked me
if I would come back over.

23:51.139 --> 23:52.626
Yeah, she left me a message

23:53.430 --> 23:55.177
saying she wanted to
talk about what happened.

23:55.195 --> 23:57.823
Lo and behold,
she's not here. Right.

23:58.919 --> 24:00.679
She did, uh, leave this note.

24:03.419 --> 24:04.546
"Sorry I had to leave.

24:04.547 --> 24:06.475
"I forgot I promised my friend Amy

24:06.476 --> 24:07.867
I'd do her toenails."

24:07.972 --> 24:09.362
She doesn't give up, does she?

24:11.375 --> 24:12.782
She's worse than my mother.

24:13.123 --> 24:14.782
Look, as long as we're both here,

24:14.783 --> 24:17.961
why don't... we go
find a neutral space

24:17.962 --> 24:19.179
where we can just talk?

24:19.740 --> 24:21.957
That would feel false.
Kevin, it's been three weeks.

24:21.958 --> 24:22.751
And what,

24:22.752 --> 24:26.063
you feel there's some statute
of limitations on cheating?

24:26.127 --> 24:29.151
No. But I think you're
making this all about you

24:29.152 --> 24:30.275
instead of about us.

24:30.276 --> 24:31.652
Excuse me? Kevin...

24:32.938 --> 24:34.442
I did a terrible thing... yeah.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.583
So terrible that I've let
you define the debate.

24:40.014 --> 24:42.431
But sometimes it feels like
my life is all about you.

24:43.414 --> 24:45.863
It's like you consume all
the oxygen in the room.

24:46.894 --> 24:48.512
That night,
my restaurant was opening.

24:49.452 --> 24:50.761
And instead of it being about me,

24:50.762 --> 24:53.789
it became all about you,
about why you weren't there,

24:53.790 --> 24:55.391
about you missing Robert, and...

24:55.439 --> 24:58.151
I was so exhausted from
trying to solve your problems,

24:58.152 --> 24:59.975
and somebody came up
to me and offered...

25:01.587 --> 25:03.028
To make it all about me.

25:03.907 --> 25:06.147
So that's what our
relationship was about,

25:06.371 --> 25:08.100
solving m-my problems?

25:08.101 --> 25:11.574
You're saying it happened
because you were so ignored,

25:11.575 --> 25:13.601
you had to find
solace somewhere else?

25:13.602 --> 25:16.508
No. I'm saying my life
with you is beautiful,

25:16.509 --> 25:17.772
and I cherish it.

25:18.502 --> 25:20.855
But it's not without its problems,
and that night,

25:21.054 --> 25:23.485
I let the problems get the
better of me, and I failed.

25:24.091 --> 25:26.995
Kevin, I am here fighting for us.

25:27.806 --> 25:28.942
Can't you see that?

25:31.526 --> 25:32.646
Yes, I can.

25:33.475 --> 25:35.428
But I'm scared to let you back in.

25:37.679 --> 25:38.527
Oh.

25:42.990 --> 25:45.850
Hi, hi, hi, hi. I'm sorry.
I know I'm late.

25:45.851 --> 25:47.302
Mom, I'm so sorry.
There was traffic.

25:47.303 --> 25:49.717
It was... it was...
Wh-where is everybody?

25:49.718 --> 25:52.571
Wh-where's the photographer?
He'll be back in a moment.

25:52.572 --> 25:55.116
Oh, okay. Okay.
Well, good, 'cause I am here...

25:55.674 --> 25:58.364
And I am totally...

25:58.794 --> 26:00.734
Totally camera ready.

26:00.735 --> 26:01.566
Where's Sarah?

26:01.850 --> 26:02.571
I don't know.

26:02.692 --> 26:05.238
Probably sitting in
some dark room someplace

26:05.239 --> 26:05.993
hating my guts

26:05.994 --> 26:09.742
because you so lovingly
led her down memory lane.

26:09.743 --> 26:11.767
Oh, mom, please. You know what?

26:11.768 --> 26:12.602
I am so sorry about that.

26:12.603 --> 26:15.546
Why did you say all of that to her? No,
you have this all wrong.

26:15.547 --> 26:17.638
All I was trying to do
was impress upon her

26:17.639 --> 26:19.490
that I actually have
some business acumen,

26:19.491 --> 26:20.843
and she took it to
a whole nother...

26:23.167 --> 26:25.183
Well, thank God you're here.

26:25.343 --> 26:27.407
Of course I'm here, mom.
Why wouldn't I be here?

26:27.420 --> 26:29.755
I fully support and
believe in your career.

26:30.651 --> 26:32.613
Well, good. Then please sit down,

26:32.614 --> 26:35.366
and I will go get all
the rest of the folks...

26:35.367 --> 26:37.594
The photographer and my publicist

26:37.595 --> 26:38.597
and... and the producer.

26:38.598 --> 26:40.159
We get it mom. You've got people.

26:40.160 --> 26:43.582
You're horribly successful. Sarah.

26:43.586 --> 26:45.226
If you're gonna be mad
at somebody, Sarah,

26:45.227 --> 26:47.731
just be mad at me.
I'm not mad. I'm fine.

26:47.732 --> 26:48.817
Oh, right,
just like in high school,

26:48.818 --> 26:51.243
when I accidentally
ripped your jelly shoes,

26:51.244 --> 26:54.306
and you walked around for a week saying,
"I'm fine. I'm fine."

26:54.307 --> 26:55.611
And the next thing I know,
my homecoming shoes

26:55.612 --> 26:57.275
are in the toilet.
Do you remember that?

26:58.207 --> 26:59.669
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

26:59.670 --> 27:02.569
- I'm talking about your passive-aggressive
behavior, Sarah. - My passive-aggressive...

27:02.570 --> 27:04.279
Yeah. Your
passive-aggressive behavior,

27:04.280 --> 27:06.696
yes. What do you call
telling me about the loan?

27:07.428 --> 27:09.939
Girls, please. Can we just put
it on hold for a little while?

27:09.940 --> 27:11.278
She's making much too
much of that, mom.

27:11.279 --> 27:11.894
It's ridiculous.
It's absolutely ridiculous.

27:11.895 --> 27:13.214
Well, I think you would overreact

27:13.215 --> 27:14.830
if you heard what
she said about you.

27:15.387 --> 27:18.673
What did she say about me?
Let her tell you. She said it.

27:18.674 --> 27:20.915
I didn't... nothing. I didn't...
What did you say about me?

27:21.170 --> 27:23.238
She told me you were desperate
for approval and always needed

27:23.239 --> 27:25.798
a man in your life because
you're an incurable monophobe.

27:25.833 --> 27:27.354
Oh, God, Sarah...
Really?

27:27.355 --> 27:29.034
Really? Is that...
is that what you think?

27:29.044 --> 27:31.425
I didn't... This is
totally out of context.

27:31.426 --> 27:32.849
Which, of course,
actually explains

27:32.850 --> 27:34.230
why you would suddenly
want to go into business

27:34.231 --> 27:35.830
with your stinky old sister.

27:35.831 --> 27:38.193
God forbid you should
have to spend a day alone.

27:38.194 --> 27:40.531
Oh, that's very clever, Dr.
Freud, but let's talk about

27:40.532 --> 27:42.834
the real reason why you don't
want to be in business with me.

27:42.835 --> 27:43.945
It's because you are
threatened by me... oh, please.

27:43.946 --> 27:45.731
Threatened by me then,
and threatened now.

27:45.732 --> 27:46.826
Well, you're right
about one thing.

27:46.827 --> 27:49.016
I don't want to go into business
with you. Oh, well, good,

27:49.017 --> 27:50.759
because I do not want to
be in business with you.

27:50.760 --> 27:51.817
Then why did you suggest it?

27:51.818 --> 27:53.282
See, you do that. You set me up...

27:53.283 --> 27:55.429
Because I thought maybe
you'd be able to...

27:55.430 --> 27:57.990
Girls! Stop it.
Girls! Stop it! Girls, stop it.

27:57.991 --> 28:00.749
My God, you were always two
totally different people.

28:00.750 --> 28:04.258
Kitty, the whole neighborhood
knew who you were and where you

28:04.259 --> 28:05.926
were going from the time
you were 8 years old

28:05.927 --> 28:08.448
because you went door-to-door
introducing yourself.

28:08.449 --> 28:11.978
People and politics...
It was always your calling.

28:11.979 --> 28:14.915
And, Sarah, why wouldn't
your father groom you

28:14.916 --> 28:15.595
for the business?

28:15.596 --> 28:18.067
My God, you had a small workforce

28:18.068 --> 28:20.379
running your lemonade stand.

28:20.380 --> 28:23.060
You were both guided
based on who you were,

28:23.061 --> 28:26.219
and now you're blaming
me for who you've become.

28:26.292 --> 28:27.839
You know what? Karl is right.

28:27.840 --> 28:31.030
This is not my problem.
I can't fix it.

28:31.592 --> 28:33.504
So I'm putting the bandages down

28:33.505 --> 28:35.092
and I'm walking away.

28:36.997 --> 28:37.794
We good to go?

28:37.795 --> 28:40.858
No, Frank. The photo shoot is off.

28:56.885 --> 28:57.673
Hi.

28:57.896 --> 28:59.021
Oh, hey.

28:59.022 --> 29:00.861
Your assistant told
me you were here.

29:01.597 --> 29:03.023
Well, God bless her.

29:03.611 --> 29:05.851
W-what, are you
just gonna be nice?

29:05.852 --> 29:08.591
I'm happy you're here.
So then I don't have to apologize

29:08.592 --> 29:10.121
for being a parental snob?

29:10.122 --> 29:13.472
In case you're wondering,
this seat isn't taken.

29:14.215 --> 29:15.641
All right. Thank you.

29:19.249 --> 29:21.312
I'll just have what he's having.

29:26.324 --> 29:27.325
How are you, Nora?

29:27.736 --> 29:29.233
Oh, God. Don't say that.

29:29.947 --> 29:32.571
You're liable to get
another rambling soliloquy.

29:33.883 --> 29:36.320
Well, I... I like
listening to you.

29:37.315 --> 29:39.650
Well, I'm fine.
I-I have nothing to say.

29:39.651 --> 29:44.019
Oh. Just, you know,
got up and... and went to work. Right.

29:44.993 --> 29:46.181
You know, I...

29:46.707 --> 29:48.357
I watched this... this woman

29:48.358 --> 29:50.981
as she put her little boy on...
on the school bus.

29:51.755 --> 29:54.405
And then... then she stood
there and waved and waved.

29:54.830 --> 29:56.105
I remember that feeling...

29:57.806 --> 30:00.480
Their little faces pressed
against the window.

30:02.917 --> 30:03.992
And I-I would...

30:05.305 --> 30:06.554
I would watch as...

30:08.092 --> 30:09.704
The school bus drove off

30:09.705 --> 30:12.729
and the distance between
us got bigger and bigger.

30:13.105 --> 30:14.704
It felt like my heart was being...

30:16.030 --> 30:17.142
Yanked out.

30:19.546 --> 30:22.384
And I've felt like that
ever since they were born.

30:22.957 --> 30:24.207
It's like you said...

30:25.806 --> 30:27.157
Noradrenaline...

30:28.807 --> 30:29.969
Fight or flight.

30:31.418 --> 30:32.669
The bus takes off...

30:34.969 --> 30:36.615
And I fight like hell

30:36.652 --> 30:39.914
to keep there from being
any distance between us.

30:41.801 --> 30:43.672
Oh, God. I rambled.

30:43.673 --> 30:45.509
No. I'm sorry.

30:45.510 --> 30:47.934
No, no, it's... it's good.

30:49.499 --> 30:50.298
It's good?

30:51.121 --> 30:54.170
Well, maybe you can squeeze
in one more pathetic patient.

30:54.171 --> 30:56.157
Oh, you don't need a
psychiatrist, Nora.

30:56.158 --> 30:58.546
You just... you need
someone to listen.

31:00.196 --> 31:02.333
What you need is a friend.

31:04.595 --> 31:07.094
I've been focused on my
family my whole life.

31:09.998 --> 31:11.371
I-I don't even remember

31:11.372 --> 31:12.982
what it's like to have a friend.

31:13.074 --> 31:16.548
Well, I'm certainly
no expert, but...

31:18.260 --> 31:20.185
I think it's like this.

31:21.961 --> 31:22.773
Oh.

31:25.109 --> 31:27.169
You know, I haven't been to one
of those meetings for so long,

31:27.170 --> 31:28.670
I forgot how people
go on and on and on.

31:28.671 --> 31:31.928
Oh, I know. It makes you
really crave a big...

31:31.929 --> 31:33.302
No, don't say it.

31:34.851 --> 31:35.947
Seriously, Justin,

31:35.948 --> 31:36.787
thank you.

31:39.523 --> 31:40.992
Yeah. Tomorrow, same time?

31:40.993 --> 31:41.827
Yep.

31:43.077 --> 31:45.006
But I can drive myself, I promise.

31:45.007 --> 31:45.819
Hi.

31:46.532 --> 31:48.568
Hey. I'm actually gonna,
uh, take off.

31:48.569 --> 31:51.519
Oh, no, wait. I-I want you
to hear what I have to say.

31:51.868 --> 31:55.442
I found this in the drawer
when you guys were gone.

31:55.443 --> 31:56.818
Do... do you recognize it?

31:56.819 --> 31:59.131
Uh, yeah, they gave that
to me at the hospital.

31:59.132 --> 32:01.421
It's... it's all the
stuff you were wearing

32:01.422 --> 32:02.756
right before the accident.

32:02.757 --> 32:05.405
Mm-hmm. Including this?

32:06.780 --> 32:07.530
Yeah.

32:08.654 --> 32:10.669
This is the ring that you gave me

32:10.670 --> 32:13.005
when you asked me to
marry you, isn't it?

32:13.007 --> 32:13.744
Yeah.

32:15.856 --> 32:17.769
I remember it.

32:19.531 --> 32:20.369
Holly...

32:21.368 --> 32:22.718
You... you have a lot of memories.

32:22.719 --> 32:25.281
No, no, it's not
just another memory.

32:26.182 --> 32:28.443
I remember what it felt like

32:28.648 --> 32:30.185
when you gave it to me.

32:33.172 --> 32:34.444
Un... I'm gonna
leave you two guys...

32:34.445 --> 32:35.912
No, no, Justin,

32:36.373 --> 32:39.898
I want you to see how
much progress I'm making.

32:40.098 --> 32:41.985
And now it is your turn.

32:41.986 --> 32:44.926
You can't just keep
using David and me

32:44.927 --> 32:46.648
as a way to hold on to Rebecca.

32:48.001 --> 32:48.939
Well, you're actually

32:48.940 --> 32:51.289
not the first person
to tell me that today.

32:51.838 --> 32:54.838
Justin, you gotta stay
open to whatever...

32:55.627 --> 32:57.505
Or whoever comes along.

33:00.493 --> 33:01.306
Yeah.

33:09.718 --> 33:10.350
Hey, Sarah.

33:10.351 --> 33:13.060
Hey. I've got an
apology wine for you.

33:13.622 --> 33:14.347
Really?

33:14.873 --> 33:17.463
Because I just put
some apology chardonnay

33:17.464 --> 33:18.747
in the fridge for you.

33:18.748 --> 33:19.752
Do you want to come over?

33:19.753 --> 33:20.914
Open the door.

33:23.090 --> 33:24.489
Wait a minute. You're here?

33:24.777 --> 33:25.863
I'm outside.

33:26.639 --> 33:27.526
You're kidding.

33:33.189 --> 33:33.814
I'm sorry.

33:33.815 --> 33:36.401
I should...
No, me first. You open the wine.

33:37.128 --> 33:38.176
Okay.

33:38.926 --> 33:41.276
I'm sorry, Kitty.
I just... I lost my mind.

33:41.463 --> 33:42.900
When you told me what mom said

33:42.901 --> 33:45.212
about business being my only
"thing," it just...

33:45.213 --> 33:47.183
It put this idea into my head.

33:47.996 --> 33:49.610
Did dad groom me for the business

33:49.611 --> 33:51.883
because my lemonade
stand kicked ass

33:52.145 --> 33:54.650
and he really believed
in what I'm capable of,

33:54.651 --> 33:56.568
or did he do it because he knew

33:56.569 --> 33:58.639
shiny Kitty wouldn't
want a lemonade stand?

33:58.640 --> 34:00.332
It doesn't matter what he thought.

34:00.695 --> 34:02.139
You've always been shiny,

34:02.140 --> 34:05.325
and... you know,
you were homecoming queen.

34:05.326 --> 34:07.039
God, you were almost first lady.

34:07.040 --> 34:09.538
You live in this rarefied air.

34:09.539 --> 34:12.004
Well, hot air, actually.
Just let me finish.

34:12.005 --> 34:15.693
When you told me that you wanted
to go into business with me,

34:16.668 --> 34:19.481
I went back to that bad place...

34:20.513 --> 34:22.976
Where I'm standing next to you...

34:23.641 --> 34:26.163
And I'm just... invisible.

34:26.339 --> 34:28.552
Sarah, you know that
being in politics

34:28.553 --> 34:30.610
is like a personality contest.

34:30.612 --> 34:32.501
Mom totally had my number.

34:32.547 --> 34:35.337
I am a plus-one-aholic.

34:35.338 --> 34:38.176
And I'm constantly
in need of approval.

34:38.650 --> 34:41.876
But the point is,
you could never be invisible.

34:41.900 --> 34:44.697
I know. I mean, I know that now.
I'm over it.

34:44.699 --> 34:46.422
Okay. But I've been
thinking about it,

34:47.058 --> 34:49.371
and you would be an amazing person

34:49.371 --> 34:51.254
to do this venture with,
so if you really want...

34:51.255 --> 34:52.478
Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh.
To go into business with me...

34:52.480 --> 34:54.690
No. No, I'm serious.
Just look me in the eye...

34:54.692 --> 34:56.143
No, Sarah.
Sarah, Sarah, shush. No.

34:56.143 --> 34:57.719
You were right.
You were absolutely right.

34:57.720 --> 35:01.178
I would be bored. You would
drive me crazy. Oh, thank God.

35:02.682 --> 35:05.929
But... what I am gonna do is,

35:05.930 --> 35:08.632
I am going to give
teaching a shot.

35:08.633 --> 35:09.342
You are?

35:09.343 --> 35:12.872
Yeah, Wexley has offered me
a series of guest lectures,

35:12.873 --> 35:15.328
which I think would be perfect for me,
perfect for Evan, and...

35:15.329 --> 35:17.453
Oh, my God.
They're gonna worship you.

35:17.980 --> 35:20.241
You could turn them all into
nasty little Republicans.

35:20.242 --> 35:22.528
Well, I'm certainly gonna try.

35:24.266 --> 35:25.236
So are you gonna do it?

35:25.237 --> 35:26.129
I think so.

35:26.692 --> 35:29.480
I think I am going to be
in the media business.

35:29.481 --> 35:32.180
I'm gonna put in a bid tomorrow.
Well, that's fantastic.

35:32.181 --> 35:35.771
Oh, actually, when I was going
over the asset reports...

35:36.200 --> 35:37.941
Looking through their
radio stations...

35:37.942 --> 35:41.773
All the call signs... They're all k-this,
k-that. Yeah, yeah, and?

35:41.774 --> 35:42.699
There it is.

35:43.336 --> 35:45.912
K-p-p... q.

35:45.913 --> 35:47.924
Q. Mom's... No.

35:47.925 --> 35:50.151
You can't do that.
You can't be mom's boss.

35:50.152 --> 35:52.428
No, Sarah. She will lose it.
She will go nuts.

36:03.111 --> 36:04.662
The kitchen's closed.

36:10.472 --> 36:11.546
Last year, I...

36:12.147 --> 36:13.622
Hit rock bottom.

36:13.936 --> 36:16.623
I was in a terrible place,
and you're right.

36:16.973 --> 36:18.073
It was all about me.

36:19.598 --> 36:23.334
But do you feel that it
has always been about me?

36:23.335 --> 36:26.475
What did you say,
that I "consume all the oxygen"?

36:26.476 --> 36:29.447
No. I can breathe. I just...

36:29.448 --> 36:31.197
Why didn't you tell me before?

36:31.872 --> 36:33.522
Because a part of me
loves it that way.

36:35.473 --> 36:36.609
I feel needed.

36:37.746 --> 36:39.271
You know, growing up,
I hardly felt noticed.

36:39.272 --> 36:40.184
But you...

36:42.133 --> 36:43.976
It's like you can't get
through the day without me.

36:43.977 --> 36:44.877
I can't.

36:45.958 --> 36:47.695
And sometimes,
I let that go too far.

36:50.071 --> 36:52.612
When you didn't show
up to my opening,

36:52.613 --> 36:53.520
it hurt...

36:54.620 --> 36:55.595
So much.

36:57.458 --> 36:59.550
I wanted to be the
star that night.

37:01.957 --> 37:03.337
But, Kevin, believe me I would...

37:04.312 --> 37:05.400
Never do that again.

37:06.263 --> 37:07.273
That's the problem,

37:07.274 --> 37:11.899
because I can't promise the
same about... changing.

37:11.900 --> 37:14.214
Obviously I'll... I'll try,

37:14.215 --> 37:16.511
but the way you
described me just now?

37:16.512 --> 37:17.623
It's pretty accurate.

37:17.624 --> 37:20.052
I can be self-centered
and neurotic...

37:20.053 --> 37:22.312
Lovable and strong.

37:22.812 --> 37:26.126
And needy and high-maintenance.

37:26.127 --> 37:28.150
Caring, loyal...

37:28.151 --> 37:30.325
Always, always loyal.

37:31.662 --> 37:34.799
Scotty, I want us to
better more than anything.

37:35.962 --> 37:37.217
But even if you wanted to,

37:37.218 --> 37:39.092
you wouldn't have
time to look after me.

37:39.093 --> 37:40.281
Look at this place.

37:41.068 --> 37:42.734
I just wish there was
something that I could do

37:42.735 --> 37:45.016
to prove to you how
much I want to change,

37:45.017 --> 37:48.868
because... I want to
keep growing with you.

37:50.718 --> 37:51.718
There is something.

37:53.980 --> 37:54.992
You can forgive me.

38:07.114 --> 38:08.159
I still owe you a coffee.

38:08.160 --> 38:10.132
And I know you have
a screwy schedule,

38:10.133 --> 38:12.753
so I was hoping that, you know,

38:12.754 --> 38:15.895
maybe we could find a
sanitized corner and...

38:16.270 --> 38:18.092
The thing is, my shift just ended,

38:18.093 --> 38:20.255
so I was just about to leave.

38:20.256 --> 38:21.894
Oh, well, maybe we
can go somewhere.

38:21.895 --> 38:24.093
You know, have...
have an actual meal

38:24.094 --> 38:25.618
or... or go to a movie.

38:26.781 --> 38:28.896
So what, you're
suggesting we go off

38:28.897 --> 38:30.417
to some cozy restaurant,

38:30.418 --> 38:32.707
just you, me, and the in-laws?

38:32.708 --> 38:35.683
Ex-in-laws. They...
they actually dumped me yesterday.

38:35.684 --> 38:37.804
It was pretty sad,
but in a good way.

38:39.416 --> 38:41.153
Are you sure you're
ready for coffee?

38:41.766 --> 38:43.999
Caffeine is a gateway drug,
you know?

38:44.000 --> 38:46.224
It can lead to
lunches and dinners.

38:46.225 --> 38:49.263
Well, you're in medicine.
You know how sometimes

38:49.264 --> 38:50.350
you have to tell a patient that

38:50.351 --> 38:52.665
they don't need the crutches
anymore, they can walk?

38:52.703 --> 38:55.845
Well... I'm ready to walk.

38:56.327 --> 38:57.328
Walk with me then.

38:58.772 --> 39:00.468
I know a nice little
sterile corner

39:00.469 --> 39:03.430
by the I.C.U. Ooh.
Sounds romantic.

39:03.942 --> 39:05.266
You know, you're never
gonna be able to move on

39:05.267 --> 39:07.067
unless you do something
about that tan line.

39:07.068 --> 39:08.398
Oh, right. Well, funny enough,

39:08.399 --> 39:11.156
I found a tiny tanning booth
that just does fingers.

39:11.157 --> 39:13.561
So now it looks like I'm
wearing gloves all the time.

39:14.475 --> 39:16.485
So... mom's not here.

39:16.486 --> 39:17.686
You know, maybe she's not coming.

39:17.687 --> 39:19.823
There's a grandkid on a stage.

39:20.161 --> 39:21.048
She's coming.

39:22.145 --> 39:24.599
Well, I just don't understand
why we have to tell her now.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.249
Why don't we just, like, tell her,

39:26.250 --> 39:29.728
say, later... on the
phone when I'm not there?

39:29.729 --> 39:32.427
Because I can't risk her
hearing it from anybody else.

39:32.428 --> 39:33.987
Come on. It's gonna be fine.

39:34.068 --> 39:36.056
She's not gonna kill me in public.

39:36.520 --> 39:37.044
Smile.

39:37.045 --> 39:39.904
Well, well, well,
will you look at this? Uh-oh.

39:39.905 --> 39:42.447
Oh, cute. I leave you
alone for one night,

39:42.448 --> 39:44.941
and you're back to being
bosom buddies again.

39:44.942 --> 39:48.323
Do we need any more proof than that?
Proof of what?

39:48.324 --> 39:49.975
My obsolescence.

39:50.016 --> 39:52.064
My God, raising you girls

39:52.065 --> 39:54.806
was like some kind of
emotional Ponzi scheme.

39:54.807 --> 39:56.598
I would take one from this
one and give to that one,

39:56.599 --> 39:58.748
but, ladies,
the pyramid has collapsed.

39:58.749 --> 40:02.247
I am walking away. My God.
I think she's breaking up with us.

40:02.248 --> 40:03.772
Yeah, it sounds like it.

40:04.597 --> 40:07.135
Well, you have to take
this with a grain of salt.

40:07.136 --> 40:10.248
It is me talking after all,
so let's go get...

40:10.249 --> 40:12.460
Wait, mom. I need to, uh,
tell you something.

40:12.461 --> 40:14.295
No, no, no, no, Sarah, Sarah.
The debate is about to start.

40:14.296 --> 40:16.262
Kitty, shh. It's fine.
No, no, you have to go. Go on.

40:16.263 --> 40:19.215
Mom, um, I wanted you
to hear this from me.

40:19.216 --> 40:21.887
This morning I made a bid
on a small media company.

40:21.910 --> 40:24.971
Oh, a media company.
Advertising. That's wonderful.

40:24.972 --> 40:28.759
She's trying to buy KPPQ. Sorry.

40:29.372 --> 40:31.709
I couldn't take the tension.
Thanks for that.

40:31.837 --> 40:34.763
You're try... you're trying
to buy my radio station?

40:34.764 --> 40:35.664
Mom, this, you know, company

40:35.665 --> 40:38.267
has holdings in all these
different companies.

40:38.268 --> 40:41.076
There's newspapers and
local TV stations.

40:41.077 --> 40:44.814
So I-I wouldn't personally be,
you know, managing you.

40:44.815 --> 40:47.714
Oh, you're not managing
me at all, missy.

40:47.715 --> 40:49.200
Not at all. Not at...

40:49.201 --> 40:52.138
Oh, um, are Kevin
and Scotty here yet?

40:54.676 --> 40:55.973
They're not coming, are they?

40:55.974 --> 40:57.329
Oh, sweetie, listen...

40:57.330 --> 41:01.218
I know. Just go in and get seats.

41:01.581 --> 41:03.950
Okay. Yes, go get a seat.
You have a debate to do.

41:03.951 --> 41:05.622
Break a leg.
Let's go, Kitty. Come on.

41:05.623 --> 41:06.475
You're gonna be great, baby.

41:06.476 --> 41:07.788
Just go in, mom. Okay.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.045
Hey. You organize your notes?

41:11.046 --> 41:14.101
How do you feel? I knew it.
I knew I could do it.

41:14.102 --> 41:14.951
Do what?

41:15.996 --> 41:19.198
Resolved... Paige is the best
couple fixer in the world.

41:19.199 --> 41:21.033
True. Hurry up.
You're gonna be late. Yeah.

41:21.034 --> 41:22.183
Thanks, guys.

41:22.858 --> 41:24.104
You're welcome. Go get 'em, champ.

41:24.105 --> 41:25.690
Yeah, break a leg.
Yeah, make us proud.

41:25.691 --> 41:27.465
I might even win today. Whoo!

41:30.515 --> 41:31.828
So you're sure you
want to do this?

41:31.979 --> 41:34.452
Watch kids mangle two hours
of debate? Probably not.

41:34.453 --> 41:35.818
Well, that's what
uncles do, right?

41:35.819 --> 41:38.540
I guess. Scotty.

41:38.952 --> 41:39.677
Yeah.

41:40.302 --> 41:41.177
I love you.

41:42.415 --> 41:43.439
I love you, too.
