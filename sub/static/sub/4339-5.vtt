-<i> Dr. Barnes,</i>

00:06.140 --> 00:09.207
Dr. Goodweather worked
under you at the CDC,

00:09.209 --> 00:11.442
did he not?
- Goodweather went rogue.

00:11.444 --> 00:13.277
I did everything
I could do to stop him!

00:13.279 --> 00:15.646
As of now,
you are no longer involved.

00:15.648 --> 00:18.315
I had him arrested by the FBI.

00:18.317 --> 00:21.718
- These are vicious predators.
They need to be put down.

00:21.720 --> 00:24.721
We're gonna take back Staten
Island one block at a time.

00:24.723 --> 00:27.790
Staten Island is
a plague-free zone.

00:27.792 --> 00:32.026
- Finding a cure or making
a vaccine is nearly impossible,

00:32.028 --> 00:35.062
but what we can do
is take everything we know

00:35.064 --> 00:37.364
about how to stop an epidemic
and use that knowledge

00:37.366 --> 00:39.699
to start one.
- Infect the infected.

00:39.701 --> 00:42.802
- Break the chain.
- He's infected

00:42.804 --> 00:46.305
and it's spreading.

00:46.307 --> 00:48.907

(baby crying)

01:14.330 --> 01:16.396
- This is
a mandatory evacuation!

01:16.398 --> 01:19.365
- Relax. My wife,
she's very sick.

01:19.367 --> 01:20.566
- She's gonna have to go
downstairs and get tested.

01:20.568 --> 01:22.568
- Clear!
- Move it!

01:22.570 --> 01:24.736
- Go! Go! - Let's go!
- OK, OK, OK.

01:33.112 --> 01:34.845
- Ma'am, we need
to take a look around.

01:34.847 --> 01:38.615
- We stay in curfew!
- This is a safety procedure.

01:49.193 --> 01:51.092
- Oh, shit.

01:53.296 --> 01:54.995
(growling)

01:57.566 --> 01:59.599
(growling)

02:06.807 --> 02:10.642
- You gotta watch out
for the white goo. You clean?

02:10.644 --> 02:13.411
- Yeah, I'm good.

02:13.413 --> 02:15.446
- All right, all clear
on the seventh floor?

02:15.448 --> 02:18.649
- Clearing the last one now,
Captain.

02:22.154 --> 02:24.487
Bathroom's clear.

02:28.592 --> 02:30.925
Mikey, I got a kid here.

02:30.927 --> 02:33.159
Are you OK?

02:34.929 --> 02:38.497
Where are your parents?

02:38.499 --> 02:40.499
You're supposed to get
downstairs, all right?

02:44.504 --> 02:48.171
Honey, let's go find
your family. Come on.

02:57.814 --> 03:01.115

I need backup: apartment 710.

03:01.117 --> 03:03.417
Come on.

03:11.092 --> 03:13.425
(creature screaming)

03:15.162 --> 03:17.295
- What the hell is that thing?
(creature croaking)

03:17.297 --> 03:19.096
- It doesn't matter.
Just kill it.

03:26.605 --> 03:27.903
- Captain, behind you!

03:30.674 --> 03:32.907
- Jesus, they're fast.

03:35.344 --> 03:38.144
Come on, you're fine.

03:38.146 --> 03:40.546
You're gonna be fine.
Got a little bit more.

03:40.548 --> 03:43.048
Come on.
You'll be all right. OK.

03:43.050 --> 03:45.116
All right.

03:45.118 --> 03:48.652
(strange croaking)
(screaming)

03:48.654 --> 03:50.420
No! Ah! Ah!

04:07.905 --> 04:10.071
- Hey, fall back, fall back!
Everybody, fall back!

04:10.073 --> 04:12.073
We've got to get out of here!

04:12.075 --> 04:14.008

04:14.010 --> 04:16.343

04:16.345 --> 04:18.545
She's just got the flu!

04:18.547 --> 04:21.748
- Sir, get back!
- Grandpa, no!

04:21.750 --> 04:24.217
- Standard operating procedure.

04:24.219 --> 04:27.019
Folks, a little
cooperation, please.

04:27.021 --> 04:28.854
- You all right, Dempsey?

04:28.856 --> 04:30.555
- I'm OK...

04:30.557 --> 04:33.724
A little weak, but...

04:33.726 --> 04:36.326
it didn't get me in the neck,
thank God.

04:40.898 --> 04:45.100
- Yeah, thank God.

05:54.830 --> 05:56.830
- Hi.

05:56.832 --> 05:58.798
I'm a friend
of Dutch Velders.

05:58.800 --> 06:02.201
- Come in.

06:08.575 --> 06:11.075
- So, three IDs, she said?

06:11.077 --> 06:14.278
- Oh! We have IDs.
We just need

06:14.280 --> 06:16.246
new names.

06:16.248 --> 06:18.248
- Interesting.

06:23.187 --> 06:25.353
Ephraim Goodweather

06:25.355 --> 06:28.556
from the news...

06:30.359 --> 06:32.258
So how's
the fugitive life going?

06:32.260 --> 06:35.461
- Don't believe everything
you see on TV.

06:35.463 --> 06:38.297
- I said I saw it;
I never said I gave a shit.

06:38.299 --> 06:40.632
(typing)
OK, government ID

06:40.634 --> 06:42.800
will get you out of the city,

06:42.802 --> 06:44.802
but seeing as you're having
your 15 minutes of fame,

06:44.804 --> 06:47.137
you might want
to change your appearance.

06:47.139 --> 06:49.105
(typing very fast)

06:49.107 --> 06:51.273
(siren blaring)

06:51.275 --> 06:54.209
(dogs barking)

07:00.049 --> 07:01.715
- QUIET!

07:01.717 --> 07:04.451
SIT!

07:04.453 --> 07:07.053
(clanging)

07:07.055 --> 07:11.156
(metal detector
zipping and beeping)

07:11.158 --> 07:13.158
- It's just a walking stick.

07:13.160 --> 07:15.360
The handle is metal,
as you can see.

07:15.362 --> 07:18.029
- Go!

07:24.503 --> 07:26.736
- Who sent you here,
old man?

07:26.738 --> 07:29.371
- I've heard about you
from several

07:29.373 --> 07:31.973
of my former
business associates.

07:31.975 --> 07:35.376
Like you, I'm a buyer
and seller of things, Mr. Creem,

07:35.378 --> 07:37.511
but on a smaller scale.

07:37.513 --> 07:40.413
- Let's see what you brought.
- I'm here to buy.

07:40.415 --> 07:43.315
- What would you like to buy?

07:43.317 --> 07:45.884
- The<i> Occido Lumen,</i>

07:45.886 --> 07:49.487
a medieval text that hasn't been
seen in many years.

07:49.489 --> 07:51.989
I'm hoping that in this calamity

07:51.991 --> 07:53.924
the book might surface again.

07:53.926 --> 07:55.592
- Book? Not an AK-47

07:55.594 --> 07:57.560
or a pass to get you
out of the city

07:57.562 --> 08:00.763
on a container ship?
You want a book?

08:00.765 --> 08:03.165
- I'm prepared to make it
worth your while.

08:09.205 --> 08:11.238
- Where did you get those?

08:11.240 --> 08:14.374
- I've been holding onto them
for many years,

08:14.376 --> 08:16.609
saving them for a time
when I needed them.

08:16.611 --> 08:18.544
A time like this, perhaps.

08:18.546 --> 08:20.913
- Well, thanks for
coming, old man.

08:20.915 --> 08:23.181
I think I'll take those.

08:25.752 --> 08:29.053
- A chain of events is about
to play out here, Mr. Creem.

08:29.055 --> 08:31.889
Your loyal bodyguards will
riddle me with bullets,

08:31.891 --> 08:33.523
but not before I draw this blade
across your throat.

08:33.525 --> 08:35.691
To put it in language
we both understand,

08:35.693 --> 08:38.960
you will not come out well
in this trade.

08:43.398 --> 08:47.466
- Hey, you want,
you want a book?

08:47.468 --> 08:49.201
I just bought some
old books, yeah?

08:49.203 --> 08:50.936
They're around
here somewhere.

08:50.938 --> 08:54.606
- Show me.

08:54.608 --> 08:56.608

- And then it's just a cab ride
over to the Pentagon

09:00.980 --> 09:03.113
for some sort
of mass-dispersal plan.

09:03.115 --> 09:05.148
The military is more prepared
for biological warfare

09:05.150 --> 09:07.150
than we'd like to think.

09:07.152 --> 09:09.952
Anyway, the point is,

09:09.954 --> 09:13.488
we've got a shot.
You, me and Nora, we can set

09:13.490 --> 09:14.889
the reset button
on this thing

09:14.891 --> 09:17.491
and make it safe again
so we can go home.

09:17.493 --> 09:19.326

go home without Mom.

you with a bunch of people

09:41.948 --> 09:44.182

09:49.621 --> 09:52.722
talk to you for a second?

10:06.102 --> 10:09.936
Let's get packed. I want
to get on the 1:30 train.

10:09.938 --> 10:12.471
- What are we
doing here, Eph?

10:12.473 --> 10:16.041
- We tested the weapon twice.
It works. We gotta get moving.

10:16.043 --> 10:18.777
- I agree. But let's think this
through for a second.

10:18.779 --> 10:21.412
You're a fugitive,
I'm your known associate,

10:21.414 --> 10:23.947
and he is your kid.
- I changed our names.

10:23.949 --> 10:27.750
- Don't you think our little
family group is gonna draw

10:27.752 --> 10:29.752
attention, especially passing
through security checkpoints

10:29.754 --> 10:31.754

for government officials?

10:31.756 --> 10:33.822
- I'm not leaving Zack behind.
(phone ringing)

10:33.824 --> 10:36.925
- You wouldn't be leaving him.

10:36.927 --> 10:39.227
- He would be here with me.
- Hello.

10:41.164 --> 10:44.098
- You're not going?
- You need to be able

10:44.100 --> 10:47.301
to fly under the radar.
And if something falls apart,

10:47.303 --> 10:49.336
you need to just
drop everything and run.

10:49.338 --> 10:52.906
- Well, Fet's been arrested.
- What, what do you mean?

10:52.908 --> 10:54.140
- I mean he's in bloody
custody for trying

10:54.142 --> 10:55.574
to blow up the
tunnel last night.

10:55.576 --> 10:57.342
- Shit! - We're kind of
in the middle of something here.

- It's that Staten Island lady
and her goon squad.

10:59.179 --> 11:01.112
I'm gonna go down there.
- I need to go with her.

11:01.114 --> 11:03.614
She's gonna get arrested, too.
- No, no. Please, please.

11:03.616 --> 11:06.850
You're right, I'm wrong.

11:06.852 --> 11:09.285
It's not practical,

but I need you.

11:11.822 --> 11:14.088
We're partners.

11:17.927 --> 11:21.928

this time, Eph.

33:21.523 --> 33:26.492
- No.
- Open your mouth, please.

33:26.494 --> 33:27.559
Please.

33:29.663 --> 33:31.663
In the past 72 hours, have you
had any physical contact

33:31.665 --> 33:33.665
with a person who exhibited--
- I'm not infected.

33:33.667 --> 33:36.134
I should know, I'm one
of the first people to discover

33:36.136 --> 33:38.769
these symptoms.
- What's your name?

33:38.771 --> 33:41.104
- Jonathan Crowley.

33:41.106 --> 33:43.106
Dr. Jonathan Crowley.

33:43.108 --> 33:46.542
- Got some ID?

33:51.548 --> 33:53.548
- Thank you, Doctor.

34:15.538 --> 34:17.871
- Goodweather!
- Shut up.

34:17.873 --> 34:20.473
I'm not letting you
get in my way again.

34:20.475 --> 34:22.908
- You think I like the position
they've put me in?

34:22.910 --> 34:25.310
They nearly threw me
over a balcony, Eph.

34:25.312 --> 34:27.478
I can't even sleep.
I barely eat.

34:27.480 --> 34:29.847
- Then just let me go.
I've got a plan

34:29.849 --> 34:32.415
to wipe out all the infected
and clean all this up.

34:34.552 --> 34:36.951
- Well, that's great news.

34:39.422 --> 34:41.789
I'll let you go.

34:51.533 --> 34:54.333
I appreciate you still trying
to do something about this.

34:57.504 --> 34:59.871
- You're lying.

34:59.873 --> 35:01.906
- Trust me, Eph.

35:05.577 --> 35:07.209
Ugh!

35:07.211 --> 35:09.778
- I can't trust you, Barnes.
I know you.

35:11.381 --> 35:14.915
(both grunting)

35:25.427 --> 35:27.527
- (intercom):<i> Next stop:</i>
<i> Baltimore Penn Station.</i>

35:27.529 --> 35:29.929
<i> Please gather</i>
<i> all your belongings.</i>

35:36.370 --> 35:39.270
(wind roaring)
(train horn blowing)

35:44.076 --> 35:47.477
- Shit!

35:47.479 --> 35:49.545
- You're not
gonna win, Eph.

35:49.547 --> 35:52.114
You can't beat them.
Now, don't be

35:52.116 --> 35:56.118
stupid or naive and end up
on the wrong side of things.

36:01.824 --> 36:03.824
In the meantime, there's no way

36:03.826 --> 36:05.959
you're getting off this train.
I'm getting the cops.

36:05.961 --> 36:08.861
(grunting)

36:12.499 --> 36:14.665
AAAH!

36:32.584 --> 36:34.750
(indistinct chatter)

36:39.188 --> 36:41.755
- Mr. Palmer, sir!
So nice to see you.

36:41.757 --> 36:43.823
Right this way.

36:43.825 --> 36:46.859
- I thought we could use
a gentle reminder

36:46.861 --> 36:48.861
that not every institution
in this city

36:48.863 --> 36:53.064
is in a state of pandemonium.
- Yes, it seems so normal.

36:54.801 --> 36:57.701
- Denial is a special privilege
of the rich.

36:57.703 --> 37:00.536
(applause)

37:03.107 --> 37:06.341
- Well done, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

37:08.478 --> 37:10.344
- I really don't know
what they're applauding.

37:10.346 --> 37:13.046
- They're applauding you for
actually trying to do something,

37:13.048 --> 37:15.381
instead of ignoring
the problem, like them.

37:20.554 --> 37:23.321
- If it isn't New York City's
own savior!

37:23.323 --> 37:25.323
- Cardinal MacNamara!

37:25.325 --> 37:29.793
- I didn't mean to interrupt.
You are...?

37:29.795 --> 37:31.828
- This is Ms. Coco Marchand.

37:31.830 --> 37:33.496
- It's an honor,
Your Eminence.

37:33.498 --> 37:35.998
- I would ask you to join us,
but I imagine

37:36.000 --> 37:40.168
you have other obligations.
- Ah, of course.

37:40.170 --> 37:43.804
I just wanted to let you know
that a certain item

37:43.806 --> 37:47.340
that you were looking for...

37:47.342 --> 37:50.776
...might be turning up soon.

37:52.679 --> 37:55.413
- Go on.

37:55.415 --> 37:58.182
- Until I hear back
from my contact,

37:58.184 --> 38:00.584
there's nothing to be done, so,

38:00.586 --> 38:02.919
please, enjoy your evening.

38:04.822 --> 38:08.390
And I'll be in touch.

38:12.695 --> 38:14.695
- What was that all about?

38:14.697 --> 38:17.197
- Oh, nothing.

38:17.199 --> 38:20.567
- It didn't seem
like nothing.

38:20.569 --> 38:23.603
- Cardinal MacNamara
is known for procuring

38:23.605 --> 38:27.006
certain historic collectibles
from time to time.

38:28.943 --> 38:31.376
- Is that allowed?

38:31.378 --> 38:34.177
(both chuckling)

38:36.114 --> 38:38.280
And this collectible
is something you want?

38:38.282 --> 38:40.715
- Oh, yes, very much.

38:40.717 --> 38:43.451
Now, I'm famished.

38:43.453 --> 38:46.620
Shall we order?

38:46.622 --> 38:49.322
(sirens blaring)

38:52.793 --> 38:54.759
Oh...

38:54.761 --> 38:58.929
- You never collected art?
- Oh, no. Only as an investment.

38:58.931 --> 39:02.299
I'm not interested
in the aesthetics at all.

39:02.301 --> 39:04.301
Oh, that was lovely.
- Oh, yes.

39:04.303 --> 39:06.903
I can never thank you enough.

39:06.905 --> 39:08.905
Oh, my God!

39:08.907 --> 39:10.907
Oh, I hope there's
no one in there.

39:10.909 --> 39:13.109
- Oh, I doubt there is
at this late hour.

39:13.111 --> 39:17.313
Saves us having to bother
with our fireplace. Ha!

39:19.583 --> 39:21.950
I think I'll fix us
a nightcap.

39:29.926 --> 39:33.960
I wish I knew the proper way
to present you to people.

39:33.962 --> 39:37.563
(pouring drink)
- Why? Am I not presentable?

39:37.565 --> 39:41.466
- No, no, no. You misunderstand.
I mean, introducing you

39:41.468 --> 39:44.769
merely as my assistant
doesn't do you justice.

39:44.771 --> 39:49.272
You're worth
so much more than that.

39:49.274 --> 39:52.642
Yet, if I say nothing,
people make assumptions.

39:52.644 --> 39:54.944
At best, they see you

39:54.946 --> 39:57.846
as just a dazzling jewel
on my arm.

39:57.848 --> 40:01.783

40:01.785 --> 40:05.686
