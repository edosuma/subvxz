WEBVTT

00:01.367 --> 00:02.745
LESLIE: <i>This is
the best night ever.</i>

00:02.802 --> 00:04.509
I wish we were
getting married tonight.

00:04.571 --> 00:07.074
Let's just do it, then.
Leslie...

00:08.141 --> 00:10.382
Let's get married.
Tonight.

00:14.948 --> 00:16.085
Are we really doing this?

00:16.149 --> 00:17.560
I guess. Why not?

00:17.851 --> 00:21.958
The gala ends at 11:00.
At 11:01 we get married.

00:22.055 --> 00:25.332
Okay. But wait. My mom isn't here.
And your parents aren't here.

00:25.392 --> 00:27.201
Good. Yeah, that
makes it better.

00:27.394 --> 00:29.396
Yes. But we reserved a
space for May 16th,

00:29.529 --> 00:32.066
and we just ordered 200
white chocolate top hats.

00:32.131 --> 00:33.133
We did?

00:33.199 --> 00:34.269
You did, actually.
It's under your name.

00:34.334 --> 00:39.750
Leslie, we can get married May
16th or June 1st or July 57th.

00:39.806 --> 00:42.218
But doesn't it
feel right today?

00:42.275 --> 00:45.586
Yeah, it does. Every time you say
it, it just feels more right.

00:45.645 --> 00:46.988
Oh, my God. We're getting
married tonight.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.048
This is really great.
Yeah.

00:48.114 --> 00:49.286
You're either in
or you're out, buddy.

00:49.349 --> 00:50.487
I... It was my idea.

00:50.550 --> 00:51.585
I'm totally in.

00:51.684 --> 00:52.754
Wait. Wait. No. We can't. Okay.

00:52.819 --> 00:54.856
This is our wedding day.
This is very bad luck.

00:54.921 --> 00:56.559
Turn around. We can't
look at each other.

00:56.623 --> 00:59.433
Well, you are aware that we've seen
each other several times today.

00:59.492 --> 01:00.698
We have two hours
to do this.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.205
I want you to get
everyone together

01:02.262 --> 01:03.673
and meet me at Ann's
house in 10 minutes.

01:03.763 --> 01:05.299
Okay. Oh, wait.
Before we get married,

01:05.364 --> 01:06.844
there is something
we need to discuss.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.038
I mean, we've never
talked about it,

01:08.101 --> 01:10.377
but I really want you
to take my last name.

01:11.271 --> 01:12.511
Oh. Oh.

01:12.572 --> 01:13.983
Okay... Really?

01:14.040 --> 01:17.146
Yeah. It's just really
important to me symbolically

01:17.210 --> 01:20.657
that Leslie Knope disappears
and becomes Leslie Wyatt.

01:20.713 --> 01:23.353
Or Councilwoman Mrs. Ben Wyatt.
That's fine, too.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.191
It's a deal breaker.

01:27.620 --> 01:29.156
Wait, are you messing with me?
Yeah, sorry.

01:29.222 --> 01:30.394
Oh, my God. I had
to give it a shot.

01:30.457 --> 01:31.959
Ben. Now, go. Run!
Okay. Okay.

01:32.158 --> 01:33.603
Wait. Where do I go?
Run!

01:54.814 --> 01:55.884
BEN: The falcon
is entering!

01:55.949 --> 01:56.984
The turtle dove
acknowledges.

01:57.050 --> 01:58.586
Hey. Where are you?
I'm here.

01:58.685 --> 02:00.096
Okay. Let's go over
the duties right now.

02:00.153 --> 02:02.292
Ann, you're in charge of the dress
and the hair and the makeup.

02:02.355 --> 02:05.825
And I was thinking, like the
sensuality of Eleanor Roosevelt

02:05.892 --> 02:08.098
combined with the animal
magnetism of Lesley Stahl.

02:08.495 --> 02:09.496
Piece of cake.

02:09.596 --> 02:11.473
Oh. We have to get the wedding cake.
I'll do that too.

02:11.598 --> 02:13.600
I'm perfectly calm.

02:13.666 --> 02:16.977
I feel like every crazy thing Leslie's
ever had me do has been like a drill.

02:17.036 --> 02:18.947
And today
is the real thing.

02:19.005 --> 02:22.851
I'm ready, because I had the greatest
teacher in the world, Leslie,

02:22.909 --> 02:23.910
who is crazy.

02:24.511 --> 02:26.889
Also, we also need rings
and marriage licenses.

02:26.946 --> 02:28.550
Oh! Let me be on rings.
I love what they symbolize.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.093
Great. And I can do the license.

02:30.183 --> 02:32.322
I've got a guy that works in City Hall.
And that guy is my wife.

02:33.019 --> 02:34.862
You also work there.
Oh, yeah.

02:34.921 --> 02:37.128
Ron, I'm going to need you
to walk me down the aisle.

02:37.190 --> 02:39.170
It would be an honor.
And the first time

02:39.225 --> 02:41.136
I won't regret
walking down the aisle.

02:41.694 --> 02:44.265
Oh, uh, yikes! We need an officiant.
TOM: I got this.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.402
You can become an ordained minister
online in, like, five minutes.

02:47.467 --> 02:50.971
Do you want more, like, a Steve
Harvey vibe, or straight-up Seacrest?

02:51.037 --> 02:52.641
No. Never mind.
I'll combine them.

02:52.705 --> 02:53.775
"Steve-crest".

02:53.840 --> 02:55.410
Okay.
And Jerry and Donna...

02:55.475 --> 02:57.785
I need you guys to just make sure
that the gala runs smoothly.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.687
Let's say that we're all going
to meet back here in an hour.

02:59.746 --> 03:02.090
I love all of you.
One, two, three, break.

03:03.483 --> 03:04.484
BEN: Excuse me.

03:04.551 --> 03:06.326
We're looking for a
couple of wedding rings?

03:06.386 --> 03:08.559
You're going to want to look through
the jewelry and nails tray.

03:08.655 --> 03:11.226
There's some beautiful jewelry in here.
But be careful.

03:11.291 --> 03:12.895
There's also nails.

03:13.793 --> 03:14.828
Oh.

03:14.894 --> 03:16.498
Well, these aren't bad.

03:16.563 --> 03:18.770
Those are real nice. And they
were nipple rings at one point.

03:20.700 --> 03:21.735
How do you know that?

03:22.001 --> 03:24.880
Mmm. They were yours. They were his.
Let's go.

03:25.638 --> 03:27.777
Hey, it's pretty crazy. I'm
going to be a cop tomorrow.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.581
I guess I better commit as many
crimes as possible tonight.

03:29.642 --> 03:30.950
Get it out of my system.

03:31.010 --> 03:32.648
Found the marriage licenses.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.692
And I'm going to
take all of them.

03:34.747 --> 03:36.283
I don't want anyone else in
this town to get married

03:36.349 --> 03:37.851
because it makes it
less special for us.

03:37.917 --> 03:39.794
Good call, babe.
Let's roll.

03:39.919 --> 03:41.193
Okay.

03:41.254 --> 03:42.665
(GASPS)

03:42.822 --> 03:43.823
ANDY: I'm good.

03:45.024 --> 03:47.231
It's not finished. Why didn't
the seamstress finish it?

03:47.393 --> 03:49.168
If you're not going to finish
something three months early,

03:49.229 --> 03:50.299
then don't
accept the job.

03:50.363 --> 03:51.808
There's got to be
something we can do.

03:51.864 --> 03:53.741
This wedding is meant to be.
We're going to figure it out.

03:53.866 --> 03:56.710
Now, how did Cinderella
finish her dress so fast?

03:56.769 --> 03:58.214
Squirrels and birds.

03:58.271 --> 03:59.375
That's not very helpful. No.

03:59.439 --> 04:00.509
ANDY: Hey, we got it.
APRIL: We got it.

04:00.573 --> 04:01.847
Marriage license.
Done.

04:02.108 --> 04:03.314
Wait a minute.
Hold on.

04:03.409 --> 04:05.286
It needs to be signed by somebody
at the City Clerk's office.

04:05.345 --> 04:07.757
I'll just forge it. I forge
government documents all the time.

04:07.814 --> 04:09.293
That's true.
LESLIE: No.

04:09.382 --> 04:10.986
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

04:11.050 --> 04:12.324
Hey.
BEN: Hey.

04:12.819 --> 04:14.492
So, we didn't
find any rings.

04:14.554 --> 04:16.329
Yeah, we're having
a few roadblocks here.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.833
It kind of feels like this
thing is falling apart.

04:17.890 --> 04:20.029
Don't panic. I swear
there are some rings

04:20.093 --> 04:22.164
in this old box of
stuff my mom gave me.

04:22.228 --> 04:23.832
It's still here at
April and Andy's house.

04:23.896 --> 04:25.398
<i>Want to come help me look? Okay.</i>

04:25.465 --> 04:26.944
Ann, dress duty.
April and Andy,

04:27.000 --> 04:28.570
license duty.
No time for verbs.

04:28.635 --> 04:29.978
(LAUGHING) I know you're
in a rush, Leslie.

04:30.036 --> 04:32.209
I should point out
that you said "duty."

04:32.272 --> 04:33.342
Twice.

04:33.406 --> 04:34.441
Okay.

04:35.775 --> 04:36.981
Business is a-booming.

04:37.076 --> 04:38.783
Indiana celebrity
lookalikes.

04:38.878 --> 04:40.824
I mean, this is a
brilliant idea, Donna.

04:40.880 --> 04:43.451
All my favorites are here.
We've got Orville Redenbacher,

04:43.516 --> 04:46.497
LaToya Jackson, Axl Rose,
David Letterman...

04:46.552 --> 04:49.431
Look. Don't tell anyone, but
I booked a special surprise.

04:50.757 --> 04:53.533
There's a Li'l Sebastian
lookalike on the way. What?

04:53.593 --> 04:56.233
(LAUGHING)
What? Oh, my God.

04:56.929 --> 04:58.306
(GROANING) Oh.

04:58.364 --> 04:59.604
(GRUNTS)

04:59.666 --> 05:00.872
Did you just
pee your pants?

05:01.200 --> 05:02.611
Just a dab.

05:03.002 --> 05:04.345
I better go clean up.

05:04.704 --> 05:06.047
You nasty, Jerry.

(DOOR SLAMS)

05:07.440 --> 05:08.851
Third time this week.

05:08.908 --> 05:10.546
Oh, what the hell?
What's wrong?

05:10.643 --> 05:14.181
"Your minister certification will
be emailed to you in 24 hours."

05:14.314 --> 05:16.590
(SCOFFS) But this is America.
I want it now.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.651
Sorry, Tom.
That's what happens.

05:18.718 --> 05:20.493
I had all these great bits
written for the wedding, too.

05:20.586 --> 05:22.588
I was going to beatbox.
There was a dance breakdown.

05:22.655 --> 05:25.397
I'm talking, like, six
guaranteed applause breaks.

05:25.792 --> 05:30.070
Uh, you know, lam actually ordained.
I could do the wedding.

05:30.129 --> 05:31.631
That's the worst idea
I've ever heard.

05:31.698 --> 05:33.075
Yeah.
You're right. Okay.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.976
Wait. What if you
do the ceremony,

05:36.035 --> 05:38.379
but you don't have any
stupid ideas of your own,

05:38.571 --> 05:40.573
and you just say the stuff
that I came up with?

05:40.673 --> 05:41.981
Anything to help Leslie.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.146
Perfect. Now, shut up
and start memorizing.

05:44.577 --> 05:46.887
We open with
Will Smith's monologue

05:46.946 --> 05:49.825
from the modern
cinematic classic, <i>Hitch.</i>

05:50.717 --> 05:52.458
Turtle dove?
Falcon.

05:52.752 --> 05:54.026
Turtle dove.
Falcon?

05:54.087 --> 05:55.259
Turtle dove.
There's your butt.

05:55.321 --> 05:56.561
Hey-
Hey-

05:56.622 --> 05:58.192
Did you find the rings?
No rings.

05:58.324 --> 06:01.737
Just a tennis bracelet and a
necklace that says "wine chick."

06:01.894 --> 06:04.170
No rings,
no license, no dress?

06:04.664 --> 06:07.110
This idea felt so right,
but maybe it's just too crazy.

06:07.166 --> 06:08.668
Maybe it wasn't
meant to be.

06:09.769 --> 06:10.839
Hey, it's snowing.

06:10.937 --> 06:11.972
(GASPS)

06:12.038 --> 06:13.517
It's him.
What?

06:13.806 --> 06:15.843
BEN: Who? I can't see.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.554
I don't understand.
This is impossible.

06:17.610 --> 06:19.021
BEN: What...

06:21.814 --> 06:22.849
Whoa.

06:22.915 --> 06:24.189
Li'l Sebastian?

06:24.417 --> 06:27.364
No, no. Sorry.
Actually, this is Bucky.

06:27.420 --> 06:30.765
He's a licensed
Li'l Sebastian impersonator.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.996
We're headed to the gala so folks
can pose for pictures with him.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.368
Two hundred a pop,
if you're interested.

06:35.428 --> 06:36.463
Quiet, you.

06:36.929 --> 06:39.068
This is Li'l Sebastian.
And this is a sign.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.469
We're going to do this.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.243
We are going to
pull this wedding off.

06:42.668 --> 06:44.579
Come on, Bucky.
Li'l Sebastian.

06:44.704 --> 06:45.808
Yes, ma'am.

06:49.742 --> 06:50.777
Oh, my God. We're
running out of time.

06:50.843 --> 06:53.722
Ann, please tell me that you have
sewn a new dress from scratch.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.450
Or several dresses, because
I would love some options.

06:55.615 --> 06:57.219
I have an idea,
and it might be insane.

06:57.283 --> 06:59.729
But I've been watching a lot
of Project Runway recently.

06:59.786 --> 07:00.821
And the past eight years.

07:00.887 --> 07:02.958
Okay, great. So, I trust you.
And make it work.

07:03.022 --> 07:04.729

the Tim Gunn voice.

There's always time.

07:06.759 --> 07:09.000

you have less than an hour.

official police business.

07:17.336 --> 07:18.371
I hope we didn't
wake you up.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.418
It's after 10:00.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.211
I've been asleep for four hours.
What do you want?

07:23.276 --> 07:24.914
We need you
to sign this.

07:24.977 --> 07:26.149
It's a marriage license.

07:26.212 --> 07:27.316
Ethel?

07:27.647 --> 07:28.819
Is it robbers?

07:28.881 --> 07:30.019
No. Go back to bed.

07:30.416 --> 07:31.724
Aw, is that
your husband?

07:31.784 --> 07:33.957
I'm not married.
I was on a date tonight.

07:34.020 --> 07:36.193
It went well.
He's sleeping over.

07:37.156 --> 07:38.362
Cool.

07:38.424 --> 07:39.903
It would really mean
a lot if you'd sign it.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.370
It's for Leslie Knope
and Ben Wyatt.

07:41.427 --> 07:42.428
I think you know them?

07:42.495 --> 07:44.873
They dragged me out
in the freezing cold once

07:44.931 --> 07:48.276
so they could tell each other "I love you".
It was annoying.

07:48.334 --> 07:49.813
ANDY: Oh,
thank you so much.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.309
You have got an amazing house
and a really cool nightgown,

07:52.371 --> 07:53.475
and seem to be
super good at dating.

07:53.539 --> 07:55.143
Yeah. So, can we adopt
you as our grandma?

07:55.575 --> 07:57.020
Fine.
ANDY: (LAUGHING) Cool!

07:57.076 --> 07:59.556
Okay. Love you, Grandma!
We love you, Grandma.

08:00.379 --> 08:01.619
BEN: I guess we could go
to a pharmacy.

08:01.681 --> 08:04.218
But I really don't want to use,
like, a cheap plastic ring.

I hate to say this, but Ann Perkins
has terrible taste in rings.

08:08.387 --> 08:12.062
What is this? It's a toe
ring with a brown gemstone?

08:12.124 --> 08:14.263
Is this a ruby
that's gone bad?

08:14.660 --> 08:16.571
I am out of ideas.

08:16.629 --> 08:18.302
Jewelry store.
No, that's closed.

08:18.397 --> 08:19.740
That's why
we're doing this.

08:19.799 --> 08:21.039
Perhaps I can be
of service.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.272
HOW?

08:22.335 --> 08:24.406
How much do you think Ann
would miss this sconce?

08:24.470 --> 08:26.245
Well, I don't know.
It's part of her house.

08:26.739 --> 08:28.116
(GRUNTS)

08:28.641 --> 08:30.143
Well, okay.

08:30.743 --> 08:33.222
"When I heard Ben was getting
married, I was like,

08:33.513 --> 08:35.754
"'To Leslie,
or to Game of Thrones?"'

08:35.948 --> 08:37.894
Ugh! Horrible delivery.

08:38.083 --> 08:40.394
"You ever heard Leslie
talk about Ben's butt?

08:40.553 --> 08:41.623
"I'm all like,

08:41.754 --> 08:44.530
'"Damn, girl, you mad sweet
on that back meat.'"

08:44.590 --> 08:46.001
You're murdering
my beautiful words.

08:46.058 --> 08:47.469
Do you even want to
kill at this wedding?

08:47.527 --> 08:50.235
I just want Leslie and Ben to have
a nice night. I'm sorry. I...

08:50.296 --> 08:53.072
No. No. It's my fault
for believing in you.

08:53.132 --> 08:55.373
Look. To be official,

08:55.434 --> 08:57.243
I just have to do the vows
and the pronouncement.

08:57.436 --> 08:59.143
So, why don't you
handle the speech,

08:59.205 --> 09:00.843
and then I'll just
come in at the end?

09:01.140 --> 09:03.643
Well, I'm not crazy about the
part where you do something,

09:04.310 --> 09:07.348
but I do like the idea
of me doing something.

09:08.314 --> 09:09.520
Let's give it a shot.

09:10.182 --> 09:13.789
<i>Hello, everyone. Got some bad news.
The gala ends at 11:00.</i>

09:14.186 --> 09:16.826
<i>The good news is,
at 11:01,</i>

09:17.089 --> 09:19.569
<i>we'll be holding
a special wedding ceremony.</i>

09:19.659 --> 09:24.165
<i>Everyone is invited to stay. All the
drinks and the food will be on us.</i>

(ALL CHEERING)

09:28.000 --> 09:29.479
Hey.
Everything going okay?

09:29.535 --> 09:30.673
Everything would
be peachy

09:30.736 --> 09:32.738
if it weren't for that
dumb-ass with a megaphone.

09:32.805 --> 09:35.342
<i>No one wants a park here.</i>

09:35.474 --> 09:37.852

09:37.910 --> 09:39.753
Hey, Butter-teeth.
What's up?

09:39.845 --> 09:41.256
I can fix those
chompers for you.

09:41.314 --> 09:42.918
Just come to
Jamm Orthodontics.

09:42.982 --> 09:44.586
Councilman Jamm,
what are you doing here?

09:44.650 --> 09:45.890
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

09:46.218 --> 09:48.027
<i>Parks are stupid.</i>

09:48.087 --> 09:49.225
Okay. Enough.

09:49.288 --> 09:52.394
You better give me back that megaphone.
That belongs to my aunt.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.265
Why don't
I call you a cab?

09:54.894 --> 09:56.339
No. This isn't over,
Knope.

09:56.462 --> 09:58.499
It is over.
I won fair and square.

09:58.731 --> 10:01.678
And in a half an hour, lam
getting married over there

10:01.734 --> 10:03.338
to the most perfect man
in the world.

10:03.402 --> 10:04.642
And all my dreams
are coming true.

10:04.737 --> 10:06.614
<i>Knope rules.
Jamm sucks.</i>

10:06.672 --> 10:08.310
<i>Knope rules.

10:08.374 --> 10:09.512
<i>Knope rules.
Jamm...</i>

10:09.575 --> 10:10.645
Councilman Howser.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.519
Leslie. Jeremy.

10:14.013 --> 10:16.254
You better make sure my aunt
gets her megaphone back.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.826
Okay. Did I do it right?
How does it look?

10:19.218 --> 10:21.994
Terrible. And perfect.

10:22.421 --> 10:24.924
I promised myself I was
not going to cry tonight.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.838
And I have already broken
that promise five times.

10:27.893 --> 10:31.136
But I will not
break it a sixth.

10:31.897 --> 10:33.808
Go ahead and let it out,
buddy. It's okay.

10:34.867 --> 10:36.141
I have something for you.

10:37.937 --> 10:40.383
It is the letter
from the state house

10:40.873 --> 10:42.784
telling us that we've been
assigned to Pawnee.

10:43.409 --> 10:44.820
Dated May 1st, 2010.

10:44.910 --> 10:45.911
No way.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.582
We were supposed to
be here eight weeks.

10:47.780 --> 10:51.694
I am so happy that those eight
weeks turned into three years.

10:52.118 --> 10:56.362
And that you met Leslie. And
that we both found a home.

10:58.024 --> 11:00.402
Damn it. You're transferring your
crying thing over to me. (LAUGHS)

11:00.459 --> 11:01.995
It's okay, buddy.
Let it out.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.673
I gathered up
all the meaningful bills,

11:05.731 --> 11:08.610
pictures, documents,
and memos from your career.

11:09.368 --> 11:10.779
What do you think?
Is it okay?

11:10.870 --> 11:12.645
It is the most beautiful
object I've ever seen.

11:13.105 --> 11:15.642
It is like the Ann
Perkins of dresses.

11:15.708 --> 11:16.743
Yay.

11:16.809 --> 11:18.220
It is amazing.

11:18.344 --> 11:22.986
All set. (GASPS) Leslie.
Wow! You look amazing.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.162
Oh, my God.
What?

11:25.451 --> 11:26.896
I'm not supposed to see
you before the wedding.

11:27.053 --> 11:28.088
No, that's the groom.
I ruined it.

11:28.154 --> 11:29.360
Andy, that's the groom.

11:29.555 --> 11:31.091
Well, I saw him, too.

11:31.157 --> 11:32.864
I'm just going to cover
my eyes, just to be safe.

11:32.992 --> 11:36.667
Okay. So, we're ready out there
for your wedding, or whatever.

11:36.962 --> 11:39.806
My God. The license? The rings?
The officiant? Everything?

11:39.865 --> 11:41.435
Yes. It all came together.

what are you doing?

I'm being awesome.

12:09.695 --> 12:11.971
Boo. Boo, Leslie, boo.

12:12.031 --> 12:14.978
My friend, I don't think you
understand what a bad idea this is.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.343
I don't think you understand
that I would have gotten

12:17.403 --> 12:18.939
a cut of that
new Paunch Burger

12:19.004 --> 12:21.177
if she hadn't
screwed everything up.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.686
So, sorry, guys.
This wedding is canceled

12:23.743 --> 12:25.416
because the bride
is a B-hole.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.287
Hey.
Check this out.

12:27.546 --> 12:29.651
Stink bomb!
Who knows what that does?

12:29.715 --> 12:31.058
Oh!
(GRUNTS)

12:31.717 --> 12:33.628
Ugh! A stink bomb?
Are you joking?

12:33.953 --> 12:36.593
Oh, my God. Where did you
even get a stink bomb?

12:36.722 --> 12:38.565
Amazon, baby.
That's how.

12:38.791 --> 12:41.362
You are looking at a Prime
customer, everybody.

shipping for this guy.

with another one, gang!

Who cares?

Come on, man.
Just go home.

12:53.038 --> 12:54.381
And who's going
to make me?

12:55.241 --> 12:58.313
It's your wedding day.
I'll handle this.

12:58.410 --> 12:59.889
Here comes the bride.

13:00.346 --> 13:01.689
Time to go, sir.
No.

13:02.114 --> 13:03.889
Hey, get off me.
What the hell, man?

13:03.949 --> 13:05.951
Don't you touch me.
Oh.

13:06.018 --> 13:07.395
I'll give you that one.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.297
But if you
do it again, I'll...

13:09.355 --> 13:11.357
If I do what again?
What, kick your ass?

me to just... (ALL GASPING)

Ow. (SNIFFLES)

13:27.339 --> 13:28.682

13:28.741 --> 13:30.015
Good thing you're
an orthodontist.

13:30.176 --> 13:32.782
Yeah. It is a good thing.
You see my house?

13:33.312 --> 13:34.985
Five bathrooms.
Great.

13:35.047 --> 13:37.118
I'm sorry, Leslie.
For what?

13:37.216 --> 13:39.423
I've never presented a
bride on her wedding day,

13:39.485 --> 13:42.091
so I'm not 100% sure
of the duties involved.

13:42.154 --> 13:43.656
But I don't think you're
supposed to punch a man

13:43.722 --> 13:45.201
in the mouth
during the service.

13:45.257 --> 13:47.237
I think that's exactly
what you're supposed to do,

13:47.326 --> 13:49.806
if that mouth is attached
to a drunk jerk-face.

13:50.362 --> 13:53.741
Well, please don't worry about me.
Just go and get married.

13:53.966 --> 13:55.445
No.
Leslie.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.809
Ron. Listen to me
very carefully.

13:57.870 --> 13:59.611
I lost my father
when I was 10,

14:00.239 --> 14:03.516
I don't have any brothers, and
Ken Burns never wrote me back.

14:04.109 --> 14:07.420
So, I am not getting married without
you there to walk me down the aisle.

14:07.746 --> 14:09.384
End of discussion.

14:12.918 --> 14:14.363
Better get used
to this, honey.

14:14.486 --> 14:16.329
There are going to be a lot
of late nights for me here.

14:16.722 --> 14:17.826

14:17.890 --> 14:20.427
You coming to bring me coffee
while I interrogate murderers.

14:20.492 --> 14:22.597
You've had all night to get
something out of him, Dwyer.

14:22.661 --> 14:23.696
We've got to let him go.

14:23.762 --> 14:25.901
Come on, Captain. I'm this
close to getting a confession.

14:25.965 --> 14:28.241
You're never going to break him, Dwyer.
He's a psychopath.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.472
He chopped off
both of his arms

14:29.535 --> 14:30.639
so he wouldn't
leave any fingerprints.

14:30.769 --> 14:33.147
No! He did? How did
he murder a person?

14:33.272 --> 14:35.252
I don't know. Hey, Chief Fugleberg.
It's me, Andy Dwyer,

14:35.374 --> 14:36.717

14:36.775 --> 14:39.483
Listen, about my new partner.
Is it a dog?

14:40.479 --> 14:42.891
Oh. Has Chris Traeger
not told you?

14:44.650 --> 14:45.924
Told me what?

14:46.285 --> 14:49.164
Hey, Ron. We posted bail.
You're free to go.

14:49.321 --> 14:50.629
JAMM: Wait a minute. What?

14:50.723 --> 14:53.067
He punched me in the teeth.
This is an outrage.

14:53.125 --> 14:55.230
I think we have a pretty clear
picture of what went down.

14:55.294 --> 14:57.433
Sleep it off in the cell,
Councilman.

14:58.030 --> 15:00.738
Leslie, I'm so sorry.
I think we missed it.

15:00.799 --> 15:02.972
The gala's over.
They're taking it all down.

15:03.035 --> 15:06.016
Yeah. It's okay. I mean, I guess it
just wasn't meant to be after all.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.914
We'll get married in May
like we planned.

15:07.973 --> 15:10.613
You know what? I have some
champagne back at the office.

15:10.676 --> 15:13.748
Let's go back there, have a
drink, toast to Pawnee Commons.

15:13.812 --> 15:15.655
Fun! That's a good idea.

15:16.015 --> 15:17.255
It will be good.
Because I actually have

15:17.316 --> 15:18.886
some work I need
to get started on.

15:20.019 --> 15:21.589
I've got five bathrooms.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.500
I love the first floor
of City Hall at night,

15:26.592 --> 15:28.799
when all the fluorescents
are half-off.

15:29.361 --> 15:32.171
It just makes the informational
fliers look so beautiful.

15:32.264 --> 15:35.268
I've never willingly been
here later than 5:04 P.M.

15:36.035 --> 15:39.414
Before we go inside,
I'd like to say something.

15:40.940 --> 15:45.116
You are a wonderful person. Your
friendship means a lot to me.

15:46.512 --> 15:48.321
And you look
very beautiful.

15:49.214 --> 15:51.785
Okay, weirdo.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.879
Jerry, everything
I wrote is wrong.

16:16.075 --> 16:17.816
There's, like,
20 minutes of <i>Hitch</i> quotes

16:17.876 --> 16:19.583
before I even
say Leslie's name.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.758

You know what, Tom?

16:21.814 --> 16:24.556
Just speak from the heart, okay?
You'll do great.

gathered here tonight</i>

16:28.253 --> 16:32.759
<i>to join Leslie Knope and
Benjamin Wyatt in marriage.</i>

16:33.392 --> 16:36.635
It's been a long and winding
road for these two lovebirds.

16:36.962 --> 16:40.000
And they're so impatient
to begin their lives together,

16:40.132 --> 16:42.476
they moved their wedding
date up three months.

16:42.601 --> 16:45.081
So, I say let's keep it
short and sweet.

16:45.137 --> 16:46.878
Yes.
Just do it, already.

prepared your own vows?

some stuff about Leslie?

the state government,

after we got engaged,

17:34.653 --> 17:36.394

at around 70 pages.

17:40.659 --> 17:42.605
Although maybe there's a
copy of them in my office.

17:42.661 --> 17:43.969
(ALL GROANING)

17:44.029 --> 17:45.599
That's fine. I think
we can just keep going.

17:45.664 --> 17:46.734
Okay.

17:46.799 --> 17:47.971
(EXHALES)

17:48.033 --> 17:49.034
Here's what
I'll say, though.

17:49.968 --> 17:51.470
The things that
you have done for me,

17:51.970 --> 17:54.644
<i>to help me, support me,</i>

17:55.274 --> 17:57.811
<i>surprise me,
to make me happy,</i>

17:58.944 --> 18:01.686
<i>go above and beyond
what any person deserves.</i>

18:03.115 --> 18:04.219
You're all I need.

18:05.150 --> 18:06.322
I love you
and I like you.

18:07.553 --> 18:09.191
I love you
and I like you.

18:10.255 --> 18:13.361
And now, with the power vested
in me by the state of Indiana,

18:13.425 --> 18:16.201
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.400
You may now kiss the...
Well. (LAUGHING)

18:18.931 --> 18:20.501
(ALL CHEERING)

18:23.735 --> 18:25.373
Lagavulin all around?

18:25.437 --> 18:28.145
Don't bother answering.
lam already pouring.

18:28.207 --> 18:29.584
You don't have
to drink yours.

18:29.641 --> 18:30.949
Thank you.

18:32.144 --> 18:35.717
Just this once, I thought
I nailed something.

18:36.014 --> 18:37.755
Well, I'm still
proud of you.

18:37.816 --> 18:40.228
You worked hard,
and you got really close.

18:40.819 --> 18:43.459
Close only counts
in horse grenades.

18:43.522 --> 18:44.967
What?
It's a saying.

18:45.023 --> 18:46.093
Because if you're
playing horseshoes,

18:46.158 --> 18:47.933
and then, you throw
a grenade at a horse,

18:47.993 --> 18:49.199
it doesn't have to
be that close

18:49.261 --> 18:50.706
and you can still blow
the horse's legs off.

18:50.762 --> 18:52.173
<i>It's from
the movie Seabiscuit.</i>

18:52.531 --> 18:53.976
How's it going in here?

18:54.166 --> 18:57.170
Good. I was just telling
Andy that I'm proud of him.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.981
And I was just explaining
to April that I'm a failure

19:01.039 --> 19:03.041
and she should
leave me for Orin.

19:03.575 --> 19:07.284
Andy, this is a very
important moment for you.

19:07.679 --> 19:10.717
How we deal with tragedy
defines who we are.

19:11.250 --> 19:12.786
I used to be
terrible at it.

19:13.252 --> 19:14.822
Beyond terrible.

19:15.187 --> 19:18.566
You are not going to
let this deflate you.

19:18.924 --> 19:22.133
You are going to pick yourself
up, dust yourself off,

19:22.494 --> 19:25.498
and we will figure out
what the next step is.

19:27.966 --> 19:31.038
Chris can be
very paternal.

19:32.604 --> 19:33.844
I look around this room.

19:34.373 --> 19:37.286
If it weren't for Leslie Knope,
none of us would be here.

19:38.043 --> 19:41.354
So, Leslie? This song, which
is for Li'l Sebastian,

19:41.446 --> 19:42.516
is for you.

19:42.781 --> 19:44.192
(PLAYING GUITAR)

19:46.051 --> 19:49.897
(SINGING) <i>Up in horsey
heaven, here's the thing</i>

19:51.790 --> 19:56.637
<i>You trade your legs
for angel's wings</i>

19:57.996 --> 20:02.502
<i>And once we've
all said goodbye</i>

20:04.303 --> 20:09.616
<i>You take a running leap
and you learn to fly</i>

20:10.509 --> 20:14.616
ALL: (SINGING)
Bye-bye, Li'! Sebastian

20:16.715 --> 20:21.061
<i>Miss you
in the saddest fashion</i>

20:21.186 --> 20:23.792
LESLIE: <i>There were a lot of signs that Ben and!
should get married tonight.</i>

20:23.855 --> 20:26.893
<i>But truth be told, we just
really wanted to get married.</i>

20:27.659 --> 20:30.572
<i>When you're in love,
everything seems like a sign.</i>

20:30.829 --> 20:33.935
I love my husband.
I love my job.

20:34.333 --> 20:35.641
And I love my friends.

20:35.834 --> 20:38.405
Even though they really
can't handle their booze.

20:39.771 --> 20:41.614
Hey. We should just go, right?
Yeah.

20:43.442 --> 20:44.443
Careful.

20:45.844 --> 20:49.053
ANDY: (SINGING)
Spread your <i>wings</i> and fly

20:49.281 --> 20:51.761
<i>Spread your wings and fly</i>

20:54.019 --> 20:55.555
It's not rocket science.

20:56.355 --> 20:58.232
I removed the sconce,

20:58.490 --> 21:00.436
<i>fired up
my grandfather's torch,</i>

21:00.826 --> 21:03.067
<i>heated up the pieces
in a cast-iron bucket,</i>

21:03.395 --> 21:05.534
<i>liquefied the metal,
poured it into a mold,</i>

21:06.265 --> 21:09.337
obviously, keep <i>it</i> over a low
<i>flame</i> to achieve a nice temper,

21:09.668 --> 21:11.079
<i>cooled it in anti-freeze,</i>

21:11.503 --> 21:13.540
<i>and just forged
and shaped the rings.</i>

21:14.506 --> 21:16.850
<i>Any moron with a crucible,
an acetylene torch,</i>

21:16.908 --> 21:18.785
<i>and a cast-iron waffle maker
could have done the same.</i>

21:19.678 --> 21:21.351
<i>Whole thing only took me
about 20 minutes.</i>

21:22.381 --> 21:24.019
People who buy things
are suckers.
