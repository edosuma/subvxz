[Pastor Smith]<i> Danny was</i>

This is good. This is fine.

And this one,
I'll take the two rings.

03:38.351 --> 03:39.351
All right, good.

03:41.754 --> 03:43.622
[Crystal]<i> He had</i>
<i>a philosophy that</i>

<i>I couldn't imagine what
these kids had gone through.</i>

07:12.732 --> 07:15.033
<i>They had lost
both their parents.</i>

07:15.935 --> 07:18.970
In that split moment.

07:20.006 --> 07:21.473
In that store.

07:23.676 --> 07:26.678
[narrator]<i> The forensic unit</i>
<i>begins processing the scene.</i>

07:34.020 --> 07:36.354

07:38.591 --> 07:41.126
As well as three

07:57.376 --> 08:00.779

08:00.880 --> 08:02.581
<i>sitting open on a table.</i>

08:04.784 --> 08:07.752
As I continued
to process the scene,

08:07.854 --> 08:12.924
<i>I discovered that over $1,000
from the cash register was still there.</i>

08:13.025 --> 08:14.893
It hadn't been taken.

<i>Both Mike and Dan's

08:21.267 --> 08:25.136
the victims had been targeted
for a reason other than robbery.

08:27.807 --> 08:29.474
[Mullins]<i> We started</i>
<i>looking around to see</i>

08:29.575 --> 08:32.344
<i>if they had any
cameras up in the shop.</i>

08:34.113 --> 08:35.647
There was no surveillance
in the store.

08:38.084 --> 08:39.918
It was just odd that

08:40.019 --> 08:43.054
a pawnshop wouldn't
have cameras.

08:43.155 --> 08:45.991
A huge hurdle had just been
placed in front of the investigation.

<i>video surveillance,</i>

Officers located an employee at a
neighboring business, Rainbow Cleaners.

08:59.906 --> 09:03.241
<i>That witness was able to provide
us with a description of a vehicle,</i>

09:03.342 --> 09:04.342
<i>a silver van,</i>

09:04.443 --> 09:07.145

back into and park

09:07.246 --> 09:10.615
<i>behind ABC,
prior to the events occurring.</i>

09:12.585 --> 09:16.888
She saw a gentleman exit the
vehicle and described him as being

09:16.956 --> 09:18.823
kind of heavy set man
with a beard.

09:20.259 --> 09:24.229
[Dollins]<i> Our next step was</i>
<i>to do a canvas on foot</i>

09:24.830 --> 09:26.698
<i>around the entire area</i>

09:26.799 --> 09:29.701
to try to get any images
of the van that we could.

09:29.802 --> 09:32.571
Including images of the
license plate, if at all possible.

09:36.609 --> 09:39.477
[narrator]<i> Police notify</i>
<i>the victims' next of kin.</i>

09:42.915 --> 09:44.449
[Barbara]<i> We both broke down.</i>

09:46.252 --> 09:50.989
I just could not
comprehend why anyone

09:51.090 --> 09:53.658
in their right mind would
want to hurt either one of them.

09:55.795 --> 09:58.830

Lord that they didn't harm the kids.</i>

[narrator]<i> The tragic news</i>

<i>soon reaches
Dan Smith's daughter, Crystal.</i>

10:10.409 --> 10:14.980
My step-mom called
and she told me that

10:16.282 --> 10:18.350
Dad had been killed
in a robbery.

10:21.520 --> 10:27.425
<i>And I just froze
and started going, "What?"</i>

10:29.762 --> 10:32.497
I was just
in disbelief, you know?

10:33.966 --> 10:34.766
<i>I felt like,</i>

10:35.801 --> 10:37.936
<i>it had been a punch to my gut.</i>

10:41.374 --> 10:42.307
He was gone.

10:47.546 --> 10:49.014
[Peel]<i> Speaking with</i>
<i>Dan Smith's family,</i>

10:49.115 --> 10:50.815
<i>we learned that
he was a gold buyer.</i>

10:50.916 --> 10:54.619
He went around to pawn
shops all over Central Kentucky,

10:54.720 --> 10:59.024
<i>and adhered to a very
consistent, predictable schedule.</i>

11:01.060 --> 11:03.628
[Crystal]<i> Dad, often times,</i>
<i>would carry</i>

11:03.729 --> 11:06.297
<i>a lot of cash on him
for his business.</i>

11:07.266 --> 11:11.436
<i>And it could be,
you know, $100,000.</i>

11:13.372 --> 11:17.208
And we had several
conversations over the years, just,

11:17.309 --> 11:20.712
you know, saying, "Hey
Dad, I'm really concerned that

11:21.480 --> 11:24.048
you carry around so much money."

11:24.116 --> 11:27.919
[Peel]<i> We started to believe</i>
<i>that Dan Smith was the target.</i>

11:28.020 --> 11:30.455
<i>And that whatever he may
have had in his briefcase</i>

11:30.556 --> 11:34.225
was what had driven the
subject to commit the crime.

11:37.263 --> 11:40.331
<i>We began to attempt to</i>

11:40.466 --> 11:42.767
<i>trace and track
where Dan Smith had been</i>

11:42.868 --> 11:44.703
<i>prior to arriving at ABC.</i>

11:45.971 --> 11:49.574
We learned that he had
visited a jewelry store

11:49.675 --> 11:50.775
in Harrodsburg.

11:50.876 --> 11:53.511
Which is a town about
eight miles north of Danville.

11:53.612 --> 11:55.547
<i>At a place called
Lawson's Jewelry.</i>

11:59.518 --> 12:02.187
[Mullins]<i> As I entered</i>
<i>Lawson's Jewelry,</i>

12:02.288 --> 12:06.057
<i>I scanned the room
and noticed the camera</i>

12:06.158 --> 12:09.694
<i>up on the far wall
from the door,</i>

12:09.795 --> 12:14.065
that was pointed for anybody that
came and went out of that store.

12:14.166 --> 12:17.302
Can we see the footage
from yesterday morning?

12:17.403 --> 12:19.804
[Peel]<i> We may be able to see</i>
<i>if there was anyone else</i>

12:19.905 --> 12:22.741
who may have possibly
been following Mr. Smith.

12:32.551 --> 12:35.920
[Peel]<i> In acquiring the video
footage from Lawson's Jewelry,</i>

12:36.021 --> 12:38.123
we were hoping to get an idea

12:38.224 --> 12:41.493
of where the investigation
needed to go from that point.

12:43.562 --> 12:45.130
Can you bring up
the footage please?

13:06.886 --> 13:08.052
Play it back again.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.526
[Peel] Pause it there.

13:15.194 --> 13:16.694
Okay, let's zoom in.

13:18.097 --> 13:19.364
Is that him?

13:20.032 --> 13:21.199
Yes, that's him.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.600
Keep it playing.

13:24.136 --> 13:28.306
Dan Smith arrived at
about 8:16a.m. that morning.

13:28.407 --> 13:31.442
<i>And he was carrying what appeared
to be a brown leather briefcase.</i>

13:35.247 --> 13:38.216
[Mullins]<i> He walks in,</i>
<i>smile on his face.</i>

13:38.317 --> 13:40.418
Says hello to the female clerk.

13:40.519 --> 13:45.089
And continues to go towards
the back of the business.

13:48.027 --> 13:50.261
[Peel]<i> There were no other
customers in the store at that time.</i>

13:50.362 --> 13:54.032
There was no indication that
anything was out of the ordinary.

13:56.235 --> 13:57.335
There he is again.

13:58.637 --> 14:00.371
[Peel]<i> At approximately 8:39,</i>

14:00.472 --> 14:03.675
<i>Dan Smith could be seen
coming back into the frame</i>

14:03.776 --> 14:05.577
<i>from the back of the store.</i>

14:05.678 --> 14:10.315
<i>He briefly speaks with an elderly
female customer in the store</i>

14:11.750 --> 14:13.017
<i>before leaving.</i>

14:18.324 --> 14:20.325
After he goes out the door,

14:20.426 --> 14:24.429
<i>we look to see if the camera
outside catches anything.</i>

14:28.000 --> 14:30.101
We couldn't see
anything from the video.

14:30.836 --> 14:31.936
<i>Nothing at all,</i>

14:32.037 --> 14:34.005
<i>to think that
something was wrong.</i>

14:35.641 --> 14:38.209
<i>Sitting there watching that,</i>

14:38.310 --> 14:42.313
there's just something in your
belly that you're watching someone

14:42.414 --> 14:44.082
<i>that had no idea
what was to come,</i>

14:44.183 --> 14:45.917
<i>what was about to happen.</i>

14:50.356 --> 14:51.789

[Mullins]<i> It's my job.</i>

15:12.077 --> 15:14.846
But, it was... it was difficult.

15:38.537 --> 15:41.239
[Mullins]<i> The man</i>
<i>pulled out a gun,</i>

15:41.340 --> 15:44.442

and told them all to get down.

15:49.715 --> 15:51.582
He says that Dan
gave him the case.

15:54.853 --> 15:55.920
[gunshot]

16:00.326 --> 16:03.428
The man then
turned to his father.

16:10.369 --> 16:13.604
<i>Andrew said that his mom pleaded</i>

16:13.706 --> 16:15.506
<i>"Don't kill my children."</i>

His mother turned to Andrew.

He described
the suspect to me as

17:05.257 --> 17:06.858
<i>being taller than his dad.</i>

17:09.762 --> 17:13.598
He wore a green
army-type jacket.

17:22.341 --> 17:24.275
[narrator]<i> It's a match</i>
<i>for the description</i>

17:24.376 --> 17:27.078
<i>given by the witness
at the Rainbow Cleaners.</i>

17:40.092 --> 17:42.760
[Peel]<i> We started to look into the
background of the business itself.</i>

17:44.797 --> 17:47.432
<i>We learned that Mike Hockensmith</i>

17:47.533 --> 17:51.035
was co-owner of the business with another
gentleman by the name of Steve Devine.

17:53.005 --> 17:56.240
<i>We learned that usually
Steve Devine would be</i>

17:56.341 --> 18:00.211
<i>present on Friday mornings at
the store when Dan Smith arrived.</i>

18:00.312 --> 18:03.414
But on the morning
of the 20th, he wasn't.

18:05.150 --> 18:08.519
It immediately raised
red-flags for us as detectives.

18:10.389 --> 18:13.291
[Peel]<i> It would be crucial</i>
<i>for us to interview him</i>

18:13.392 --> 18:17.462
and determine his whereabouts
during the time of the crime.

18:17.563 --> 18:20.498
So, why weren't you at the
shop the day of the shootings?

18:39.618 --> 18:41.319
You can check
with my wife if you want.

18:41.420 --> 18:42.720
She was at home with me
most of the day.

18:42.821 --> 18:45.123
Why are there
no security cameras, though?

18:45.224 --> 18:46.524
That's unusual.

18:47.526 --> 18:49.193
[Peel]<i> Steve Devine told us that</i>

18:49.294 --> 18:51.762
Allen Keith, the previous
owner of the business

18:51.864 --> 18:54.265
took the security
system with him.

18:54.366 --> 18:56.400
And that he and Mr. Hockensmith

18:56.502 --> 18:58.636
had not gotten around
to replacing it.

19:00.606 --> 19:02.874
[Dollins]<i> At this</i>
<i>point in the case,</i>

19:02.975 --> 19:05.243
Steve Devine is still a suspect,

19:05.344 --> 19:07.478
until we can confirm his alibi.

19:09.648 --> 19:12.116
[narrator]<i> The previous owner</i>
<i>of the ABC Pawn Shop,</i>

19:12.217 --> 19:14.485
<i>Allen Keith, is a local pastor.</i>

19:16.989 --> 19:19.690
<i>He also owns the Gold
Rush Gold Buyers pawn shop</i>

19:19.791 --> 19:21.325
<i>in neighboring Somerset.</i>

19:23.061 --> 19:25.129
[Peel]<i> Mike Hockensmith</i>
<i>and Allen Keith,</i>

19:25.230 --> 19:29.167
had a relationship that
went back almost 15 years.

19:29.268 --> 19:30.601
Oh, good to see you.

19:30.702 --> 19:32.236
- Hey Pastor Allen.
- Hey, how are ya?

19:32.337 --> 19:33.504
[Mike] Could you grab
a stool please?

19:33.605 --> 19:35.506
Michael knew Allen
from the church

19:35.607 --> 19:37.475
where they worked
with youth camp.

19:37.576 --> 19:39.143
- [Michael] Rest your legs.
- Okay.

19:39.244 --> 19:40.545
Thank you, thank you.

19:40.646 --> 19:43.648
[Duke]<i> Mikey and Angie</i>
<i>both looked up to Allen.</i>

19:43.749 --> 19:48.019
<i>And Andrew, he looked up to
Mr. Keith as a uncle, you know.</i>

19:48.120 --> 19:50.254
He thought
he was his uncle there.

19:50.355 --> 19:51.289
How are things?

19:51.390 --> 19:53.591
[Duke]<i> He seemed</i>
<i>like a real nice guy.</i>

19:53.692 --> 19:54.959
How are things? How's business?

19:55.060 --> 19:56.160
Business is great, thanks.

19:56.261 --> 19:57.828
How are things with you?
How you feeling?

19:57.930 --> 20:00.164
You know, good days, bad days.

20:00.265 --> 20:02.333
[narrator]<i> Pastor Keith</i>
<i>sold the store to Mike</i>

20:02.434 --> 20:04.969
<i>after being diagnosed
with brain cancer.</i>

20:05.070 --> 20:06.904
You know, I will take
one of those as well.

20:07.005 --> 20:08.873
[Duke]<i> Mikey would</i>
<i>pray for Mr. Keith</i>

20:08.974 --> 20:10.908
that he would be
able to overcome.

20:11.009 --> 20:13.744
- You know, it's in God's hands now.
- [Michael] Amen to that.

20:13.845 --> 20:15.479
[Peel]<i> Pastor Allen Keith's name</i>

20:15.581 --> 20:18.149
was added to the list of people
we were looking to talk to.

20:21.687 --> 20:23.287
[Mullins]<i> Going</i>
<i>door-to-door, checking,</i>

20:24.323 --> 20:27.491
<i>we found a rental
property business.</i>

20:27.593 --> 20:30.828
And they had video,
that was recording.

20:32.564 --> 20:35.199
- So the footage from Danville Rentals.
- Is it on 4th street?

20:35.300 --> 20:39.103
Yeah, they're like less
than a block from ABC.

20:40.606 --> 20:44.108
Okay well, let's just start about
an hour before the shooting.

20:44.209 --> 20:46.944
We are just looking
for a silver van.

20:47.045 --> 20:49.780
Or a person that
matches the shooter.

21:00.058 --> 21:00.858
[Dollins] See that?

21:01.460 --> 21:02.727
Can you rewind that again?

21:08.934 --> 21:14.939
At 8:45, we're able to see
a vehicle, a silver van,

21:15.040 --> 21:17.275
pass through that frame.

21:18.610 --> 21:19.343
Pause it there.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.948
[Dollins]<i> Unfortunately, we</i>
<i>couldn't determine for sure</i>

21:24.049 --> 21:26.017
the make and model
of the vehicle.

21:26.652 --> 21:27.551
Zoom in.

21:30.022 --> 21:32.423
[Mullins]<i> We couldn't even</i>
<i>see who was driving.</i>

21:32.524 --> 21:34.659
We would replay it.

21:36.395 --> 21:37.728
<i>Just over and over.</i>

21:39.398 --> 21:42.466
We probably wore the video out
watching it so much. [laughs]

21:43.335 --> 21:45.569
<i>Trying to see the license plate,</i>

21:45.671 --> 21:48.506
to see if there were
any identifiable marks.

21:49.841 --> 21:54.211
<i>The witness at the dry cleaners
had described the van as being</i>

21:54.313 --> 21:56.180
squared off, an older model.

21:56.281 --> 21:58.316
Look!

21:58.417 --> 22:02.286
[Mullins]<i> And watching the video,
we were able to determine that</i>

22:02.387 --> 22:06.791
<i>that van was squared
from the back.</i>

22:09.895 --> 22:12.630
We think
we have found the vehicle.

22:12.731 --> 22:15.399
Try... try zooming in
on the license plate.

22:15.500 --> 22:19.070
[Mullins]<i> The license plate</i>
<i>was still blurred out.</i>

22:19.171 --> 22:20.438
<i>It was too grainy.</i>

22:21.907 --> 22:23.407
<i>And it was very aggravating</i>

22:23.508 --> 22:26.877
because we wanted
it so bad, just to...

22:26.978 --> 22:29.313
to have the next piece
that we needed.

22:33.318 --> 22:34.985
[narrator]<i> The co-owner</i>
<i>of the pawn shop,</i>

22:35.087 --> 22:38.122
<i>Steve Devine,
is still a person of interest.</i>

22:39.658 --> 22:42.660
[Peel]<i> Investigators were sent
to speak with his family members.</i>

22:43.595 --> 22:45.162
<i>They confirmed
that he was at home</i>

22:45.263 --> 22:47.331
<i>during the time of the murders.</i>

22:47.432 --> 22:49.900
That he was having
problems with his allergies.

22:50.001 --> 22:52.036
And that after
taking some medication,

22:52.137 --> 22:54.805
<i>he had decided to remain home
and not go to the shop that day.</i>

22:56.408 --> 22:59.076
<i>The fact that Steve Devine
didn't own a silver van</i>

22:59.177 --> 23:02.380
moved him down the list
of the people that we were

23:02.481 --> 23:03.681
considering for the crime.

23:06.985 --> 23:11.922
The most significant lead that we
had was the description of the silver van.

23:12.023 --> 23:13.691
[Dollins]<i> We began to</i>
<i>spread out the canvas</i>

23:13.792 --> 23:17.361
further and further
away from the pawn shop.

23:17.462 --> 23:20.264
<i>We did go to
Ephraim McDowell Hospital,</i>

23:20.365 --> 23:24.135
<i>and were able to also get some
surveillance footage there.</i>

23:26.204 --> 23:30.107
Fine, let's try it about
an hour before the shooting.

23:30.208 --> 23:33.878
[Mullins]<i> It's just another piece of the
puzzle that we're trying to put together.</i>

23:35.080 --> 23:37.581
Just following the evidence.
You've just gotta find it.

23:55.801 --> 23:56.700
You see that?

23:59.905 --> 24:02.840
[Dollins]<i> We did</i>
<i>observe a silver van</i>

24:02.941 --> 24:04.909
<i>traveling west-bound</i>

24:05.010 --> 24:07.578
towards Forest Street at 8:17.

24:09.414 --> 24:11.482
<i>We back it up and then pause it.</i>

24:11.850 --> 24:12.650
Zoom in.

24:14.820 --> 24:18.022
<i>And we were able to
determine that it was in fact,</i>

24:18.123 --> 24:20.124
<i>a silver Dodge Minivan.</i>

24:22.594 --> 24:25.729
[narrator]<i> Detectives keep
watching for another 39 minutes.</i>

24:32.204 --> 24:32.970
It's back!

24:34.573 --> 24:39.143
We again see the silver van
pass through at 8:56.

24:40.612 --> 24:44.281
And that was just 21 minutes
before the 911 call.

24:45.584 --> 24:47.418
[Mullins]<i> When we found that,</i>

24:47.519 --> 24:51.255
we knew that we were
on to the right minivan.

24:52.457 --> 24:57.027
We believe that the suspect
was circling the block,

24:57.662 --> 24:59.363
<i>passing the pawn shop.</i>

25:01.833 --> 25:04.235
<i>But we still couldn't see
a license plate.</i>

25:05.103 --> 25:07.371
We still couldn't get
the fine details

25:07.472 --> 25:09.273
to put us over that hump.

25:12.577 --> 25:14.778
[narrator]<i> It's been two</i>
<i>days since the murders.</i>

25:19.684 --> 25:22.052
[Duke]<i> We had</i>
<i>a candle-light vigil</i>

25:22.153 --> 25:24.522
for Mike and Angie
and Mr. Smith.

25:24.623 --> 25:28.025
And there was hundreds
and hundreds of people there.

25:28.126 --> 25:30.094
<i>People I've
never seen, never met.</i>

25:32.330 --> 25:35.699
That's when I realized
how many people actually cared

25:35.800 --> 25:38.402
<i>and loved Michael and Angie.</i>

25:43.108 --> 25:44.608
[narrator]<i> In Somerset,</i>

25:44.709 --> 25:48.012
<i>Daniel Smith's family

25:49.714 --> 25:53.984
The night before the funeral,
I mean, I couldn't sleep.

25:56.187 --> 25:57.388
<i>He was gone.</i>

25:58.356 --> 26:00.124
<i>And that was really hard</i>

26:00.225 --> 26:03.093
to wrap my brain around,

26:03.194 --> 26:04.395
my heart around.

26:05.997 --> 26:07.498
[Pastor Smith]<i> I was angry,</i>

26:07.599 --> 26:09.833
<i>just like
most of our family was,</i>

26:09.935 --> 26:12.403
<i>that Dan was taken from us.</i>

26:12.504 --> 26:15.873
<i>And I really
didn't want that anger</i>

26:15.974 --> 26:17.641
<i>to be a part of this funeral.</i>

26:18.410 --> 26:21.412
I just wanted everybody to know

26:21.479 --> 26:23.247
how much I love my brother.

26:23.982 --> 26:26.717
How much we love Dan.

26:29.120 --> 26:31.021
[narrator]<i> The Danville Police</i>
<i>Department launches</i>

26:31.122 --> 26:34.124
<i>a public appeal

<i>or the silver van.</i>

26:36.094 --> 26:37.227
[phone ringing]

26:39.965 --> 26:42.066
Good afternoon,
Detective Kevin Peel.

26:42.734 --> 26:44.868
[Peel]<i> On September 24th,</i>

26:44.970 --> 26:46.804
I received a phone call
from Tracy Herald,

26:46.905 --> 26:49.506
the pastor in Warren, Michigan.

28:28.006 --> 28:30.474
That was a major
red flag for us.

28:30.909 --> 28:31.875
Yeah.

28:31.976 --> 28:34.545
[narrator]<i> Allen Keith</i>
<i>is now a suspect.</i>

28:36.381 --> 28:39.883
[Peel]<i> Pastor Allen Keith was
ran through numerous databases</i>

28:39.984 --> 28:43.353
<i>to search for any previous
or prior criminal activity,</i>

28:43.455 --> 28:44.421
and nothing was found.

28:46.357 --> 28:48.759
[Dollins]<i> No matter how</i>
<i>unlikely the suspect is,</i>

28:48.860 --> 28:50.661
we have to look into them.

28:52.097 --> 28:55.032
[Peel]<i> We immediately,</i>
<i>dispatched investigators</i>

28:55.133 --> 28:58.402
to retrieve the video
from the pharmacy,

28:58.503 --> 29:01.638
where he alleged that he had
picked up the prescriptions for his wife.

29:05.443 --> 29:07.611
[Dollins]<i> If he was in there
during the time of the shooting,</i>

29:08.546 --> 29:10.047
then he wouldn't
have been a suspect.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.066
Play that back.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.238
[Peel]<i> At 9:24a.m.,</i>

29:34.339 --> 29:38.175
<i>approximately seven
minutes after the 911 call,</i>

29:38.276 --> 29:40.043
a man is seen
entering the business.

29:41.012 --> 29:42.279
[Dollins] Hey,
we're going to zoom in.

29:43.248 --> 29:44.314
Freeze it.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.985
[Peel]<i> And it was clear,</i>
<i>that it was in fact,</i>

29:48.086 --> 29:49.186
Pastor Allen Keith.

29:53.925 --> 29:58.128
<i>Nothing made me think, you
know, this could be someone who</i>

29:58.229 --> 30:02.132
10-15 minutes earlier had
committed three heinous murders.

30:03.168 --> 30:04.101
There's no beard.

30:05.603 --> 30:08.272
[Peel]<i> He wasn't</i>
<i>wearing the green jacket</i>

30:08.373 --> 30:10.340
<i>that had been
described by witnesses.</i>

30:10.441 --> 30:12.409
<i>He clearly had no beard,</i>

30:12.510 --> 30:13.977
<i>or hat or sunglasses.</i>

30:15.713 --> 30:18.081
<i>The video footage gave credit to</i>

30:18.183 --> 30:21.084
<i>Pastor Allen Keith being
at the pharmacy.</i>

30:21.186 --> 30:25.956
But it did not exclude him from
being in the area of the murders

30:26.057 --> 30:27.357
<i>at the time that they occurred.</i>

30:28.760 --> 30:31.662
And so, it did not
eliminate Pastor Keith

30:31.763 --> 30:32.896
as being a suspect.

30:35.700 --> 30:38.936
[narrator]<i> There's a seven minute
window between the 911 call...</i>

30:41.773 --> 30:44.341
<i>...and Keith's arrival
at the pharmacy.</i>

30:44.442 --> 30:46.910
We had to consider
if he would be able to make it

30:47.011 --> 30:49.913
from the crime scene to Good
Neighbor in that time frame.

30:52.951 --> 30:56.253
[Peel]<i> We decide</i>
<i>to actually drive the route.</i>

30:58.223 --> 31:01.358
We learned that it
would take around five minutes

31:01.459 --> 31:03.060
to make the trip.

31:03.161 --> 31:05.796
<i>Plenty of time
to commit the murders,</i>

31:05.897 --> 31:08.832
<i>and then leave the scene
and arrive at the pharmacy.</i>

31:12.237 --> 31:16.640
<i>I placed a phone call to the Good
Neighbor pharmacy in Somerset, Kentucky,</i>

31:16.741 --> 31:18.876
<i>and was able to confirm
with the pharmacist there</i>

31:18.977 --> 31:21.578
that they did in fact
stock the medication

31:21.679 --> 31:24.448
that he had picked up
in the Danville pharmacy.

31:26.217 --> 31:28.785
<i>I began to feel like
this was an attempt by him</i>

31:28.887 --> 31:30.053
to establish an alibi.

31:32.290 --> 31:37.728
[Mullins]<i> We did a vehicle
search on Allen Keith and his wife.</i>

31:37.829 --> 31:41.665
<i>And we were able
to discover that they had</i>

31:41.766 --> 31:44.167
a 2008 Dodge minivan,

31:44.269 --> 31:45.802
silver in color.

31:50.341 --> 31:52.309
[narrator]<i> Detectives</i>
<i>must establish if Keith</i>

31:52.410 --> 31:55.012
<i>was driving his minivan
on the day of the shootings.</i>

31:56.881 --> 32:01.718
[Peel]<i> After learning that Allen
had access to a silver minivan,</i>

32:01.819 --> 32:06.623
that just began to pile up with
everything else that we were gathering.

32:08.593 --> 32:09.760
Thank you very much.

32:11.095 --> 32:15.132
[Peel]<i> We obtained medical</i>
<i>records from the VA Hospital.</i>

32:15.233 --> 32:18.101
<i>And upon reviewing
those we learned that</i>

32:18.202 --> 32:21.004
Pastor Allen Keith had never
been diagnosed with cancer,

32:21.105 --> 32:22.906
or any type of brain tumor.

32:24.676 --> 32:27.811
<i>He had lied about his
medical ailments.</i>

32:28.479 --> 32:29.680
None of it was true.

32:33.151 --> 32:35.385
[narrator]<i> It's two weeks</i>
<i>since the killings.</i>

32:38.556 --> 32:40.657
[Peel]<i> All of this evidence</i>
<i>was circumstantial.</i>

32:40.758 --> 32:43.160
It wasn't enough to
support an arrest.

32:46.965 --> 32:50.033
<i>We made the decision to
contact Pastor Herald again,</i>

32:50.134 --> 32:55.339
and ask if he would be willing to take
part in a series of pretext phone calls

32:55.940 --> 32:57.574
<i>to Pastor Keith.</i>

32:58.309 --> 32:59.609
[phone ringing]

33:04.782 --> 33:07.084
[Peel]<i> During</i>
<i>the recorded phone calls,</i>

33:07.185 --> 33:09.319
Keith made statements...

33:15.760 --> 33:19.396
...that seemed to paint the
Hockensmiths in a very different light.

33:49.694 --> 33:51.328
[Peel]<i> Pastor Keith went on to</i>

33:51.429 --> 33:54.865
begin to discuss the details of the
case that were never made public.

34:19.690 --> 34:22.459
[Peel]<i> Mr. Keith told</i>
<i>Pastor Herald that</i>

34:22.560 --> 34:25.729
<i>once he left Danville,
he returned to Somerset,</i>

34:25.830 --> 34:28.832
where he took his vehicle to
a car wash to have it detailed

34:28.933 --> 34:31.268
in preparation for
a family vacation.

34:33.771 --> 34:36.306
[narrator]<i> Detectives may</i>
<i>now have an opportunity</i>

34:36.407 --> 34:39.910
<i>to see what vehicle Keith
was driving that day.</i>

34:40.011 --> 34:43.447
We went to
the carwash in Somerset,

34:45.216 --> 34:48.351
<i>and obtained the video
from that day.</i>

35:01.966 --> 35:02.966
That's Allen.

35:04.469 --> 35:07.170
[Mullins]<i> At 10:55a.m.</i>

35:07.271 --> 35:11.641
<i>we see Allen Keith
walking through the hallway</i>

35:11.742 --> 35:13.076
<i>to the front counter,</i>

35:15.046 --> 35:17.714
<i>I guess pays,</i>

35:17.815 --> 35:19.549
and he was cool as a cucumber.

35:24.889 --> 35:27.023
[narrator]<i> Detectives switch</i>
<i>to the external camera</i>

35:27.125 --> 35:29.326
<i>covering the carwash
parking lot.</i>

35:31.195 --> 35:34.631
My hope was that we may be able
to see what vehicle he was driving.

35:39.770 --> 35:46.076
At 11:25a.m., an outside
camera catches

35:46.177 --> 35:48.145
Keith coming out
of the car wash,

35:49.847 --> 35:52.015
<i>and leaving in a silver van.</i>

35:55.820 --> 35:57.287
[Peel]<i> That vehicle matched</i>

35:57.388 --> 35:58.855
all of the images we
had captured

35:58.956 --> 36:03.727
from the various surveillance
video systems in Danville.

36:03.828 --> 36:04.661
We got him.

36:06.364 --> 36:10.400
[narrator]<i> Police now have sufficient
evidence to arrest Allen Keith.</i>

36:19.210 --> 36:21.578
[Peel] Go, go!

36:21.679 --> 36:25.315
You're under arrest. Put your
hands on your head and turn around.

36:31.589 --> 36:33.356
[narrator]<i> At Somerset PD,</i>

36:33.457 --> 36:36.426
<i>Detective Peel questions
his prime suspect.</i>

37:11.128 --> 37:12.495
[Peel]<i> His response to us</i>

37:12.997 --> 37:14.531
<i>was very unusual.</i>

37:14.632 --> 37:18.201
He claimed that he would not be
able to successfully pass a polygraph,

37:18.269 --> 37:20.604
<i>because during his time
in the military,</i>

37:20.705 --> 37:23.006
<i>that he had been
dropped into Guatemala</i>

37:23.107 --> 37:26.142
on a mission where he
assassinated three people.

37:37.655 --> 37:40.423
[narrator]<i> Detective Peel</i>
<i>executes a search warrant</i>

37:40.524 --> 37:42.959
<i>at Keith's pawnshop at Somerset.</i>

37:48.766 --> 37:50.700
[Peel]<i> We discovered</i>
<i>a large amount of cash.</i>

37:51.369 --> 37:53.370
Well over $100,000.

37:54.372 --> 37:57.440
<i>There was no
legitimate explanation</i>

37:57.541 --> 38:00.176
to where the majority
of this money had come from.

38:02.079 --> 38:05.048
[Dollins]<i> We were able to</i>
<i>recover money bands</i>

38:05.149 --> 38:07.584
<i>that we were able to link back</i>

38:07.685 --> 38:09.786
to an account
belonging to Dan Smith,

38:09.887 --> 38:12.422
and proving that
that money had been his.

38:17.128 --> 38:22.132
[Mullins]<i> We found some .22</i>
<i>spent shell casings,</i>

38:22.233 --> 38:24.934
just outside the back door.

38:25.036 --> 38:29.005
[narrator]<i> Ballistics testing confirms
the casings are from the same weapon</i>

38:29.106 --> 38:32.709
<i>Andrew Hockensmith would see
used to gun down his parents</i>

38:32.810 --> 38:34.444
<i>and Dan Smith.</i>

38:38.449 --> 38:42.218
<i>Allen Keith is charged with
three counts of murder,</i>

38:42.320 --> 38:45.555
<i>along with burglary and
robbery in the first degree.</i>

38:49.894 --> 38:55.965
I believe what ultimately led Pastor
Allen Keith to commit the murders was,

38:56.067 --> 38:59.502
<i>he felt that Steve Devine
and Mike Hockensmith</i>

38:59.603 --> 39:03.073
had conspired to run him
out of his business.

39:05.710 --> 39:08.645
<i>He clearly knew that Dan Smith
carried a large amount of cash.</i>

39:09.680 --> 39:11.881
<i>But I think the biggest reason</i>

39:11.982 --> 39:15.719
<i>that he chose to do it on the day
that Dan Smith was gonna be there,</i>

39:15.820 --> 39:17.654
<i>was to confuse law enforcement,</i>

39:17.755 --> 39:19.856
and to throw us off.

39:19.957 --> 39:22.892
[narrator]<i> Mike Hockensmith's</i>
<i>business partner Steve Devine</i>

39:22.993 --> 39:25.195
<i>had nothing to do with the plot.</i>

39:26.197 --> 39:28.365
<i>And there was no
evidence of foul play</i>

39:28.466 --> 39:30.734
<i>when the pair
took over Keith's business.</i>

39:34.939 --> 39:36.673
[Peel]<i> We believe</i>
<i>that on that day,</i>

39:37.575 --> 39:40.543
Pastor Allen Keith
came to Danville,

39:40.644 --> 39:42.979
<i>driving in the silver
Dodge Caravan.</i>

39:45.950 --> 39:49.319
He continued to
circle around the pawnshop

39:49.420 --> 39:52.856
until Dan Smith's
vehicle was outside.

39:56.994 --> 39:59.562
[Peel]<i> Once Dan Smith had</i>
<i>arrived at the pawnshop,</i>

40:00.564 --> 40:01.698
<i>he approached the front door,</i>

40:03.134 --> 40:03.967
went inside,

40:05.603 --> 40:09.305
<i>and then demanded that Dan
Smith give him his briefcase,</i>

40:11.075 --> 40:13.810
<i>before opening fire
on Dan Smith,</i>

40:15.780 --> 40:17.280
<i>Mike Hockensmith,</i>

40:20.251 --> 40:21.751
<i>and Angie Hockensmith.</i>

40:25.990 --> 40:29.559
<i>He took a large amount of cash
from Dan Smith's briefcase,</i>

40:30.161 --> 40:31.895
<i>and then left the area.</i>

40:32.963 --> 40:36.032
Straight to
Good Neighbor pharmacy

40:36.133 --> 40:42.138
<i>to be on camera, to add
credibility to his alibi.</i>

40:42.239 --> 40:45.542
[narrator]<i> Keith then</i>
<i>heads to the carwash.</i>

40:45.643 --> 40:48.344
[Dollins]<i> That was his</i>
<i>attempt to cover his tracks,</i>

40:48.446 --> 40:51.981
and to clean up any evidence
that may have been left behind.

40:56.420 --> 41:00.290
[narrator]<i> In 2017, just as</i>
<i>his trial is set to start,</i>

41:02.526 --> 41:05.261
<i>Allen Keith pleads
guilty on all counts,</i>

41:07.164 --> 41:09.699
<i>and is sentenced
to life without parole.</i>

41:11.435 --> 41:15.572
The level of evil that
he demonstrated, just...

41:15.673 --> 41:17.240
It can't be explained.

41:19.443 --> 41:21.244
[Pastor Smith]<i> It's</i>
<i>a very warped mind</i>

41:22.213 --> 41:23.947
<i>that would do what he did,</i>

41:24.748 --> 41:27.250
think the thoughts
that he thought,

41:27.351 --> 41:29.752
and then be able to
live with himself

41:29.854 --> 41:31.020
after he did it.

41:35.693 --> 41:42.098
[Barbara]<i> Andrew has been able to
sit and talk to me about how he feels.</i>

41:44.535 --> 41:48.738
<i>That's helped him
overcome what has happened.</i>

41:51.442 --> 41:53.610
He'll always remember it.

41:53.711 --> 41:55.144
He'll never forget it.

41:55.246 --> 41:59.816
But at least he can
put it behind him,

41:59.917 --> 42:02.151
<i>and move on with his life.</i>

42:04.288 --> 42:07.056
[Duke]<i> As long as Andrew</i>
<i>and Naomi are alive</i>

42:07.157 --> 42:10.493
<i>Mike and Angie will
still be alive with us.</i>

42:10.594 --> 42:13.296
We still love them
every day of our life.

42:16.500 --> 42:19.369
[Crystal]<i> Dan Smith was</i>
<i>not just a gold buyer.</i>

42:20.271 --> 42:22.705
<i>He was this really great man.</i>

42:24.775 --> 42:26.743
<i>He'll always be a part of me.</i>

42:27.811 --> 42:29.479
<i>He's never gonna be gone.</i>

42:31.582 --> 42:32.882
He just, he went home...

42:33.417 --> 42:34.918
[sniffles]

42:35.019 --> 42:37.020
..., and he's
waiting for us there.
