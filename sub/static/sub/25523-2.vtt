WEBVTT

00:22.897 --> 00:24.315
I just don't know how to use these sticks.

00:26.276 --> 00:28.695
I miss my aguachile from
Las Palms, in Culiacan.

00:31.239 --> 00:32.449
Did they use tamarind?

00:33.825 --> 00:35.243
I can't eat with these things.

00:37.829 --> 00:39.456
This meat is...

00:40.498 --> 00:41.958
The chili is missing, right?

00:42.083 --> 00:43.918
We should get some scallops
as soon as we get back.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.336
Of course.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.046
I hadn't congratulated you, Joaquin.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.590
Now you're really the fucking best.

00:49.758 --> 00:50.592
Look, babe.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.222
You're doing everything right, Mayel.

00:56.431 --> 00:58.433
Thanks to you, Sinaloa is everywhere.

00:58.767 --> 00:59.768
Thank you, Mayel.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.186
We've have had a great time.

01:01.269 --> 01:02.520
A toast for 701.

01:03.563 --> 01:04.689
For 701.

01:04.814 --> 01:06.066
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.817
-Cheesr.
-Cheers, man.

01:11.654 --> 01:13.281
It was a pleasure having you here.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.661
Did I raise this kid right, or what?

01:20.830 --> 01:21.915
Don't worry about a thing,

01:22.123 --> 01:24.709
our partners fixed everything so
you won't have any problems with customs.

01:25.877 --> 01:27.462
Bye, Mayel. Take care.

01:28.379 --> 01:29.214
Bye.

01:32.175 --> 01:33.468
Thanks for everything, son.

01:33.760 --> 01:34.594
You did great.

01:43.561 --> 01:44.437
What's up, sir?

01:44.771 --> 01:45.605
Mayel?

01:45.772 --> 01:47.690
I got you the appointment
with the bank's owner.

01:48.858 --> 01:49.901
Are you coming to Mexico soon?

01:50.276 --> 01:51.319
I wasn't planning to.

01:51.611 --> 01:54.030
Let me finish things
and I'll give you a date, OK?

01:54.239 --> 01:56.866
Good. The sooner the better.

02:22.934 --> 02:26.896
I feel the warmth
from my boiling blood

02:27.480 --> 02:31.609
I feel the fear, sweat dripping away

02:31.734 --> 02:35.697
There's a stillness
that nothing transmits

02:36.364 --> 02:42.370
I'm a breeze that grows stronger

02:42.453 --> 02:45.582
Even when the clouds drift away

02:46.666 --> 02:50.295
Even when my skin dries away

02:51.045 --> 02:54.591
I'll be back someday

02:55.592 --> 02:59.721
To unleash my return

03:04.267 --> 03:08.187
I have the dust that protects the road

03:08.438 --> 03:12.567
I have the branches of a leafless tree

03:13.276 --> 03:17.238
I'm the guardian of the tired night

03:17.447 --> 03:23.494
There are silhouettes that
come to meet me

03:24.120 --> 03:28.374
Even when the clouds drift away

03:28.458 --> 03:31.419
Even when my skin dries away

03:32.462 --> 03:36.132
I'll be back someday

03:37.258 --> 03:41.137
To unleash my return

04:05.245 --> 04:07.288
If it's not for daily use,
you have more options, sir.

04:08.414 --> 04:09.832
I'll have it with me at all times.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.253
I want a small gun, automatic.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.005
I like these.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.467
The Beretta 92 and the Colt 45.

04:20.426 --> 04:21.719
If I can give you my opinion, sir.

04:22.512 --> 04:23.721
I'd choose the Colt.

04:23.972 --> 04:27.225
It weighs 3 ounces more.
You won't forget you have it on you.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.953
I want it designed with this inscription.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.957
I want it plated in gold and diamonds.

04:53.459 --> 04:54.877
When can I pick it up?

04:56.587 --> 04:58.047
In two weeks, Mr. Joaquin.

05:01.843 --> 05:05.930
MEXICO CITY

05:21.321 --> 05:24.115
Berta is more like you
than you think, Conrado.

05:26.951 --> 05:29.329
She also wants to be president of Mexico.

05:49.766 --> 05:52.268
But Mexico is not ready for either of you.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.355
You, because you're an intelligent woman.

06:07.325 --> 06:08.826
You, because you're homosexual.

06:17.335 --> 06:21.547
Relax. If we're going to work together,
no more secrets.

06:30.598 --> 06:34.393
Berta needs a platform
and would be a great first lady.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.354
Is a great way to start.

06:37.980 --> 06:38.940
You, Conrado,

06:39.565 --> 06:42.360
besides portraying yourself
as a family man,

06:43.111 --> 06:44.654
you need to clean up your image.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.032
And Berta is an expert at that.

07:04.841 --> 07:07.385
You can count on me
for your political careers,

07:07.468 --> 07:11.055
and I count on you to follow
the steps I suggest.

07:25.736 --> 07:27.196
First will be the marriage.

07:27.905 --> 07:29.949
So you can be appointed
secretary of state

07:30.241 --> 07:31.826
as a married man.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.579
You can count on me.

07:37.165 --> 07:38.875
I give you my word, godfather.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.350
I hope you like it, sir.

09:35.783 --> 09:38.953
It has embellishments in the safety,
the cock, and the grip.

09:52.174 --> 09:53.134
It's perfect.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.088
If you'll excuse me.

10:38.721 --> 10:41.474
Are you organizing the party
to celebrate the magazine?

10:41.974 --> 10:43.726
Yes, it's going to be at ranch in Durango.

10:44.435 --> 10:46.937
Hurry up with the scallops
because I want to go make a kid.

10:51.442 --> 10:53.986
I like this way better than that fish
with tamarind in Malaysia.

10:58.366 --> 11:02.495
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
MEXICO CITY

11:06.749 --> 11:07.875
How was your trip?

11:08.042 --> 11:09.043
Long but good.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.879
What time are we leaving for Culiacan?

11:12.296 --> 11:13.631
The airplane leaves at noon.

11:13.756 --> 11:16.467
That way you can see your family,
and tomorrow you go with the banker.

11:17.885 --> 11:19.637
I'll leave you at the house in Lomas
so you can rest

11:19.720 --> 11:21.055
until the airplane is ready.

11:34.318 --> 11:35.319
Hello, Alexei.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.265
You should try to rest.

12:04.807 --> 12:05.933
If you want anything, let me know.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.269
Thank you,
and thank you for picking me up.

12:58.527 --> 13:00.237
Say goodbye to Mexico, sir.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.948
You've been loyal all this time, Lora.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.118
You're a friend.

13:49.995 --> 13:51.372
They sell them all over Culiacan, sir.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.874
We're really good for business here.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.210
Send someone to buy several of each one.

13:57.878 --> 13:58.712
Sir.

13:59.129 --> 14:00.297
Mayel has been arrested.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.092
What do you mean? Where?

14:03.551 --> 14:05.135
In Mexico, at the Lomas house.

14:06.512 --> 14:07.471
Does Ismael know?

14:07.638 --> 14:09.098
They're telling him right now.

14:11.392 --> 14:12.226
And Lora?

14:12.393 --> 14:14.853
His car is parked in front
of the house in Lomas.

14:15.437 --> 14:16.522
But we don't know anything about him.

14:18.607 --> 14:20.067
Search his house here in Culiacan.

14:31.537 --> 14:35.207
LORA'S HOUSE
SINALOA, MEXICO

15:44.777 --> 15:45.778
Fucking traitor.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.238
We have people looking for him
in the capital, sir.

15:50.824 --> 15:51.742
Put it away.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.495
Cancel the party.
This is no time to celebrate.

16:00.209 --> 16:01.043
Conrado.

16:02.294 --> 16:03.379
What the fuck is going on?

16:04.505 --> 16:05.631
Why was Mayel arrested?

16:09.677 --> 16:11.220
I wasn't aware of the operative.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.723
It was Navy Special Forces
working together with the DEA.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.269
This was a warning.

16:20.729 --> 16:22.898
You should have stopped
the labs in Malaysia.

16:24.316 --> 16:25.943
We have to keep the gringos as allies.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.236
If they ask something, you do it.

16:27.361 --> 16:29.238
I'm not their dog obeying their orders.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.532
I obey the business.

16:32.533 --> 16:35.119
The arrest of Mayel is in order
for him to be extradited.

16:42.042 --> 16:43.711
They can't take him away.
Tell them to stop.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.506
I'm going to cancel Malaysia
and close that route.

16:48.173 --> 16:49.133
Do it quickly.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.302
The judge is still putting
the files together.

16:53.387 --> 16:55.472
Apparently they're going to take him
to a prison near the border.

16:56.223 --> 16:58.017
But let me tell you
that his processing is going fast,

16:58.100 --> 16:59.727
it's out of the ordinary.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.069
Mayel Zambrano was captured this morning

17:09.194 --> 17:10.154
in the nation's capital.

17:10.237 --> 17:12.197
According to authorities,
the young mafia boss,

17:12.281 --> 17:15.117
the son of the known drug lord
Ismael Zambrano,

17:15.200 --> 17:18.537
is a fundamental part in the logistics
of the Sinaloa Cartel.

17:18.746 --> 17:21.874
The authorities say that
with Mayel Zambrano being captured,

17:22.124 --> 17:24.835
it significantly affects
the operative capacity

17:24.918 --> 17:27.337
and the drug trafficking
of the organization,

17:27.546 --> 17:29.131
whose leader is El Chapo Guzman.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.633
Joaquin Guzman Loera, El Chapo Guzman,

17:31.842 --> 17:35.429
was recently named as one
of the richest men in Mexico

17:35.721 --> 17:37.514
by Forbes magazine. Mayel Zambrano...

17:37.639 --> 17:41.351
I canceled all the operations in Malaysia
so the gringos can calm down, man.

17:41.518 --> 17:42.728
...was captured and presented...

17:42.853 --> 17:43.729
Calm down.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.690
We will get him out of there before
the judge can sentence him.

17:48.442 --> 17:49.443
I hope so.

17:49.693 --> 17:52.446
...long- and short-range guns and cash.

17:53.072 --> 17:56.325
Damaso recommended a law firm
that has the best litigators.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.452
Valdovinos and Garduño.

17:58.660 --> 17:59.828
GARDUÑO AND VALDOVINOS
LAWYERS

17:59.912 --> 18:01.622
I hired them this morning
when I heard the news.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.220
Your father asks you to relax.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.972
We won't let them take you out
of the country.

18:20.557 --> 18:21.517
That's good, friend.

18:22.142 --> 18:23.560
Let the lawyers take care
of the legal part.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.438
I already have people looking
for another way to help Mayel.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.859
MEXICO CITY

18:33.320 --> 18:35.739
JUDICIAL COUNCIL

18:36.240 --> 18:38.450
My contact told me the judge
always gets out at the same time.

18:40.994 --> 18:42.996
Let's convince him to help us with Mayel.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.017
We can't get anywhere near him, sir.

19:05.727 --> 19:07.146
The Navy has him covered.

19:07.521 --> 19:09.439
And his house is
under surveillance 24 hours.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.192
We can't reach the judge or his family.

19:15.237 --> 19:16.947
Unless you order a direct confrontation.

19:20.284 --> 19:22.077
We can't shake things up even more.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.164
Did you find any clues about Lora?

19:26.290 --> 19:27.457
The earth swallowed him whole.

19:29.626 --> 19:31.420
Most likely he was taken out
of the country.

19:34.798 --> 19:36.592
UNITED STATES

19:36.717 --> 19:38.635
UNDISCLOSED LOCATION

19:53.734 --> 19:55.027
You don't have to worry.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.613
You're out of Mexico
and your family is far away.

19:58.697 --> 19:59.990
Chapo has very long arms.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.534
I'll never stop worrying.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.287
Well, don't be reckless
or leave any traces.

20:06.163 --> 20:08.207
And never stay long in one place.

20:09.082 --> 20:09.917
Good luck.

20:23.764 --> 20:24.765
This one.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.560
I love classic.

20:29.353 --> 20:30.812
It's elegant, shows status.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.941
-But, since you're young...
-Well, not really.

20:34.775 --> 20:35.692
What do you mean?

20:36.193 --> 20:37.444
You look very young.

20:39.571 --> 20:41.031
Please, can we hurry up?

20:41.907 --> 20:43.200
I have to go back to work.

20:45.535 --> 20:47.704
We're both taking time from work, honey.

20:48.455 --> 20:50.499
This is important, too.

20:52.751 --> 20:53.961
You're gonna love this.

20:55.128 --> 20:57.756
My last wedding was the
Urbanianos-Velasquez union.

20:58.173 --> 20:59.299
Of course.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.093
Pato and Fer's wedding.

21:02.636 --> 21:04.179
It was gorgeous.

21:04.638 --> 21:05.764
They were delighted.

21:06.431 --> 21:10.310
Without leaving the classic behind,
we gave them a more modern touch.

21:11.019 --> 21:11.853
You like it?

21:12.813 --> 21:14.439
We don't have to do the same
as your friends.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.234
I would like something a little less...

21:18.151 --> 21:19.027
European.

21:21.405 --> 21:22.948
You're a public figure, honey.

21:24.700 --> 21:25.575
The classic style...

21:26.910 --> 21:28.161
goes with your status.

21:32.374 --> 21:35.460
I'll leave you alone so you can discuss it
and think about it.

21:36.712 --> 21:37.546
No.

21:38.380 --> 21:39.423
It's OK.

21:41.049 --> 21:42.217
Let the women decide.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.679
In the end, this is feminine territory.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.017
ALMOLOYA PRISON
MEXICO

22:00.819 --> 22:01.737
Take him out.

22:06.033 --> 22:06.992
What's going on?

22:08.118 --> 22:09.244
What's going on!

22:09.828 --> 22:10.746
Where are you taking me?

22:11.621 --> 22:12.914
I wanna see my lawyer.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.917
I'm telling you that I want to see
my lawyer!

22:20.630 --> 22:21.798
Where are you taking me?

22:22.966 --> 22:23.925
Where's Mayel?

22:24.426 --> 22:25.761
They took him to the border.

22:26.386 --> 22:28.555
To the maximum-security federal center
at Matamoros.

22:29.097 --> 22:31.683
I lost a lot of dough closing Malaysia,
Conrado.

22:33.143 --> 22:34.394
I hope it's not for nothing.

22:36.813 --> 22:37.647
Joaquin...

22:40.984 --> 22:42.569
his extradition has just been approved.

22:42.652 --> 22:43.487
APPROVED

22:44.738 --> 22:47.949
The gringos said that it's not about you
closing Malaysia or not,

22:48.992 --> 22:50.577
it's because you disobeyed from the start.

22:51.995 --> 22:54.498
Tell the DEA that if they dare
to extradite Mayel...

22:55.332 --> 22:56.458
they will regret it.

23:01.797 --> 23:03.131
APPROVED

23:03.715 --> 23:05.008
This is a sham.

23:05.592 --> 23:08.637
An extradition has never been approved
this quickly.

23:09.763 --> 23:10.847
Please, sit down.

23:10.972 --> 23:12.808
Can you tell me why
we weren't notified beforehand?

23:12.891 --> 23:15.477
That's the notification, sir,
according to the law.

23:15.685 --> 23:18.605
The law also says that we have
the right to see our client

23:18.730 --> 23:19.731
before you take him away.

23:25.529 --> 23:26.780
What happened, sir?

23:27.364 --> 23:28.740
Why was it so fast?

23:29.157 --> 23:31.201
This is very irregular, Mayel.

23:31.284 --> 23:32.577
We don't have much time.

23:32.911 --> 23:34.329
Your father and Mr. Joaquin

23:34.788 --> 23:37.332
have told us to follow your case
to the United States.

23:37.999 --> 23:39.042
Remain calm.

23:39.626 --> 23:42.045
Don't say a word until we meet there.

23:47.884 --> 23:49.553
TRANSFERS

23:49.970 --> 23:52.013
FEDERAL POLICE

24:13.326 --> 24:14.786
They just took him.

24:15.370 --> 24:17.038
We are so sorry, sir.

24:25.213 --> 24:27.424
MILITARY HANGAR
MATAMOROS, MEXICO

26:28.837 --> 26:32.299
CHICAGO, UNITED STATES

26:32.382 --> 26:33.425
Understood.

26:33.508 --> 26:35.510
Tell him that we're going
there right away.

26:36.094 --> 26:36.928
What happened?

26:37.595 --> 26:40.223
We have to go to Culiacan,
Mr. Joaquin is calling for us.

26:41.474 --> 26:43.810
There's no way he can know
that we helped Lora, right?

26:50.233 --> 26:53.153
ISMAEL ZAMBRANO'S HOUSE
CULIACAN, MEXICO

27:20.805 --> 27:24.017
Those fucking gringos have to understand
they can't mess with me.

27:24.893 --> 27:27.479
I was told you guys can get me
war-grade weapons.

27:28.521 --> 27:29.981
It depends on what you need them for.

27:30.273 --> 27:31.775
We can get whatever you need.

27:34.277 --> 27:35.153
I want a bomb.

27:37.113 --> 27:38.073
What for?

27:38.156 --> 27:39.949
To fuck their embassy up.
So they respect me.

27:40.700 --> 27:41.910
So they won't touch us again.

27:42.118 --> 27:43.953
We need to send a clear message.

27:44.037 --> 27:45.205
No, man.

27:46.456 --> 27:48.583
I'm sorry, but that will only make
Mayel's situation worse.

27:48.666 --> 27:49.626
Mayel and everybody else.

27:50.085 --> 27:52.003
A bomb is a very different mess, Joaquin.

27:52.087 --> 27:53.296
We do as you order, Dad.

27:53.380 --> 27:56.049
But if the gringos peg us as terorists,
we all get extradited.

27:56.216 --> 27:57.217
Starting with you.

28:11.689 --> 28:12.565
You're right.

28:13.608 --> 28:15.068
A bomb is not the only way.

28:16.903 --> 28:18.988
There's another way to fuck
with the gringos.

28:24.202 --> 28:27.664
This is the new information we're using
to prepare your defense.

28:28.206 --> 28:29.040
Read it.

28:29.124 --> 28:29.958
PENITENTIARY
CHICAGO, UNITED ESTATES

28:36.339 --> 28:37.257
What's this?

28:38.633 --> 28:40.552
It's the bosses' new strategy.

29:02.449 --> 29:04.617
THEY'RE GETTING MARRIED!

29:21.551 --> 29:23.845
YOU ARE INVITED TO OUR WEDDING

29:35.231 --> 29:38.026
"A MARRIAGE IS AN ACT OF COURAGE...
TOGETHER WE'LL BE STRONGER"

29:47.160 --> 29:50.413
Today Mayel Zambrano will face
American justice

29:50.705 --> 29:53.416
in a private audience
in a federal court in Illinois.

29:53.625 --> 29:56.920
Mayel Zambrano will face
the drug dealing charges

29:57.045 --> 29:58.296
he's being accused of.

30:03.426 --> 30:04.385
FEDERAL COURT OF ILLINOIS,
PRIVATE AUDIENCE

30:04.469 --> 30:05.303
CHICAGO, UNITED STATES

30:05.386 --> 30:06.346
Your Honor.

30:06.846 --> 30:08.264
I plead not guilty

30:08.681 --> 30:10.934
to all charges of drug trafficking
I'm being accused of.

30:17.774 --> 30:19.984
Since I've been working
with the consent of the DEA.

30:31.329 --> 30:34.541
The DEA and the Sinaloa Cartel
have had an agreement for years.

30:36.876 --> 30:39.587
The cartels gives information
about leaders of opposite groups.

30:41.589 --> 30:45.593
In exchange, the DEA does not interfere
in drug trafficking activities.

30:48.763 --> 30:51.307
They have granted immunity
to Joaquin Guzman Loera

30:52.058 --> 30:53.059
and Ismael Zambrano.

31:01.651 --> 31:02.819
Thank you, Valdovinos.

31:03.903 --> 31:05.488
Tell Mayel he's a badass.

31:10.910 --> 31:12.161
Your son dropped the bomb.

31:13.079 --> 31:14.706
Wait a few hours for
the scandal to explode

31:14.831 --> 31:16.082
and no one will touch us again.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.835
They will get the message loud and clear.

31:27.802 --> 31:29.721
LINKED ALLIANCES BETWEEN
THE DEA AND DRUG TRAFFICKING

31:34.517 --> 31:37.312
THE DEA HAS AGREEMENTS
WITH THE SINALOA CARTEL

32:05.173 --> 32:07.467
Before we say anything,
we want you to guarantee

32:07.800 --> 32:10.386
that you will help us disappear
like you did with Lora.

32:12.055 --> 32:15.725
We don't want run any risk that Joaquin
will know what we're about to tell you.

32:23.149 --> 32:24.901
Joaquin wanted to place a bomb.

32:27.153 --> 32:28.446
A bomb? Where?

32:28.696 --> 32:30.657
In your embassy, here in Mexico.

32:31.908 --> 32:34.911
He changed his mind at the end,
but he was serious for a moment.

32:36.287 --> 32:37.830
He asked us to get it for him.

32:42.251 --> 32:43.461
Would you give us protection?

33:36.055 --> 33:36.931
Thank you.

33:37.223 --> 33:38.057
Godfather.

33:38.516 --> 33:39.934
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

33:42.937 --> 33:44.147
-How are you?
-Thank you.

33:46.482 --> 33:47.692
Godfather, godfather.

33:52.155 --> 33:53.656
Enjoy the evening.

33:55.158 --> 33:56.826
-Mr. President.
-How are you?

33:57.869 --> 33:58.995
Hello, welcome.

33:59.871 --> 34:00.705
Hello.

34:01.247 --> 34:02.248
Congratulations.

34:02.331 --> 34:03.291
Thank you, here.

34:03.374 --> 34:05.043
You have a beautiful wife, Conrado.

34:05.126 --> 34:06.544
Thank you, sir.

34:07.128 --> 34:09.714
Her only flaw is supporting the PTI.

Congratulations again.

35:34.507 --> 35:35.758
You're very lucky.

35:36.425 --> 35:38.386
Thank you, I know.

35:40.346 --> 35:41.472
Have a good time.

35:53.234 --> 35:54.068
Thank you.

35:54.652 --> 35:56.445
Thank you for coming, thank you.

36:00.700 --> 36:01.534
Here it is.

36:27.810 --> 36:28.811
Fucking amazing, Dad.

36:29.395 --> 36:32.064
What I have achieved is big, son.
We had to celebrate.

36:32.940 --> 36:35.735
I'm so high up that
even the gringos have to respect me.

36:45.077 --> 36:46.162
Give me tequila.

36:56.255 --> 36:57.215
Come on, let's go.

37:33.542 --> 37:34.877
The anchor is in the pozole.

37:35.753 --> 37:37.588
I repeat, the anchor is in the pozole.

37:38.464 --> 37:40.091
Copy. Lopez?

37:41.175 --> 37:42.343
We are on 23.

37:53.062 --> 37:54.105
What's happening?

38:03.239 --> 38:04.240
They got us!

38:11.080 --> 38:11.914
Move!

38:11.998 --> 38:13.165
Move, move, move!

38:13.249 --> 38:14.458
We're going back, we're going back.

38:31.684 --> 38:33.436
Come on, come on!

38:37.315 --> 38:38.399
Bravo, come on!

38:40.318 --> 38:42.028
Move, move, move!

38:49.702 --> 38:50.745
Come on, come on!

39:07.428 --> 39:08.512
Stop!

39:10.139 --> 39:11.640
Lopez, they got us, come over here!

39:11.724 --> 39:12.641
Let's go!

39:17.813 --> 39:18.898
Hang in there, we're coming!
