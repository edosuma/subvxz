01:42.703 --> 01:45.639
Something on your mind, Balki?

01:45.672 --> 01:50.276
[chuckles]
Cousin, you can read me
like a cheap suit.

01:50.310 --> 01:53.413
Cousin, if you were me
and you wanted to get you

01:53.446 --> 01:55.882
to do something
that was really hard

01:55.916 --> 02:01.221
long hours and no pay,
how you would get you to do it?

02:01.254 --> 02:02.756
‐Well, that’s easy.
‐Really?

02:02.789 --> 02:04.490
Well, sure,
I’m a reasonable man.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.326
I’m willing to listen
to logical arguments.

02:06.359 --> 02:08.428
‐Well, I thought so.
‐Oh, yeah, sure.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.895
So go ahead,
just state the facts

02:09.930 --> 02:11.565
support it with statistical data

02:11.598 --> 02:13.700
then be prepared
for a flat no.

02:15.235 --> 02:18.371
Oh, forget it, cousin,
I‐I knew you wouldn’t want to be

02:18.404 --> 02:19.472
a volunteer fireman.

02:19.506 --> 02:21.908
‐Just, just never mind.
‐I’ll do it.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.844
Just forget
I said anything, okay?

02:23.877 --> 02:25.812
The firehouse needs volunteers

02:25.846 --> 02:27.213
I thought you might like
to do something

02:27.247 --> 02:28.815
for the community,
but obviously...

02:28.849 --> 02:29.916
‐I said I’ll do it.
‐I was wrong.

02:29.950 --> 02:30.951
I was wrong, okay? I was wrong.

02:30.984 --> 02:31.985
It’s not the first time
I’m gonna be wrong

02:32.018 --> 02:33.687
it’s not the last time
I’m gonna be wrong

02:33.720 --> 02:35.822
and I can live with that...

02:35.856 --> 02:37.824
‐What?
‐I’ll do it.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.693
‐You’ll do what?
‐I’ll be a volunteer fireman.

02:40.961 --> 02:43.697
You know,
you never cease to erase me.

02:45.899 --> 02:47.801
Well, Balki, Wainwright
has been after me for a while

02:47.834 --> 02:48.969
to do a human interest story

02:49.002 --> 02:51.304
and being a volunteer fireman
would be a great story.

02:51.337 --> 02:53.640
Wait a minute, cousin,
if that’s the only reason

02:53.674 --> 02:55.876
you’re going to do it,
I don’t think you should do it.

02:55.909 --> 02:58.378
Well, Balki,
that’s not the only reason.

02:58.411 --> 03:00.413
I‐I would think my commitment
to the community

03:00.446 --> 03:02.549
goes without saying.
So when do we start?

03:04.284 --> 03:05.586
I guess tomorrow.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.453
Well, great!

03:07.487 --> 03:08.722
Yeah.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.726
You don’t seem
that excited about it.

03:12.759 --> 03:16.863
Well, I‐I don’t know, cousin,
I, I got just what I wanted.

03:16.897 --> 03:20.400
I‐I‐I got you to do exactly
what I wanted you to do

03:20.433 --> 03:24.838
and yet somehow you managed
to suck all the joy out of it.

03:24.871 --> 03:27.808
[instrumental music]

03:40.654 --> 03:43.590
Cousin, they gave us hats.

03:44.925 --> 03:47.260
I love hats.

03:47.293 --> 03:50.463
I particularly love this hat.
It’s so elaborate.

03:50.496 --> 03:53.299
You know, on Mypos,
the firefighters

03:53.333 --> 03:55.736
wear a watermelon rind
with a chin strap.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.874
Balki, this is gonna
be a piece of cake.

04:02.876 --> 04:05.679
I’m Chief Newton. I’m in charge
of training volunteers.

04:05.712 --> 04:08.448
What a coincidence!
We are volunteers.

04:08.481 --> 04:09.716
I hate volunteers.

04:11.718 --> 04:15.488
They like to wear the hat,
but they can’t take the heat.

04:15.522 --> 04:17.891
The hats are yours
when you finish the training.

04:17.923 --> 04:18.992
Oh, no.

04:19.959 --> 04:23.764
Don’t take my hat.
I need it, I need it.

04:23.797 --> 04:26.667
I must have the hat.
I, I love the hat.

04:26.700 --> 04:27.734
Maybe I can...

04:27.768 --> 04:29.435
[laughing]

04:39.112 --> 04:40.881
Uh‐uh, say, uh, chief

04:40.914 --> 04:43.950
uh, before we get started,
I have a‐a couple of questions.

04:43.984 --> 04:44.985
Shut up.

04:46.119 --> 04:49.956
For the next six weeks
you do what I say when I say.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.425
If I say, "Jump."
You say, "How high?"

04:52.458 --> 04:55.061
If I say, "Make coffee."
You say, "How hot?"

04:55.095 --> 04:56.396
If I say,
"Paint the fire truck."

04:56.429 --> 04:57.564
You say, "How red?"
You got that?

04:57.598 --> 04:59.966
Uh, uh, let me recap, okay?

05:00.000 --> 05:04.538
That was, that was, uh, "How
high?" "How hot?" and "How red?"

05:04.571 --> 05:09.442
Right? Or‐or was it, was it high
hat, red hot and how now?

05:09.475 --> 05:10.977
Shut up!

05:11.011 --> 05:13.479
Do people tell you
you look like Sinatra?

05:15.582 --> 05:17.551
Alright, let’s get to work.

05:17.584 --> 05:19.052
First, I’ll familiarize you

05:19.085 --> 05:20.587
with the equipment
you’ll be using.

05:20.621 --> 05:23.524
This is an axe.
Don’t touch it.

05:23.557 --> 05:26.893
This is a high‐rise backpack.
Don’t touch it.

05:26.927 --> 05:29.930
And this is a state‐of‐the‐art
fire extinguisher.

05:29.963 --> 05:33.366

The Mighty Max.

05:33.399 --> 05:35.435
Lay a finger on it
and you’re off the program

05:37.403 --> 05:40.607
Alright, it’s time
to get into your gear.

05:40.641 --> 05:41.608
Ooh. He he he.

05:41.642 --> 05:44.144
This is a breathing apparatus.
On your back.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.411
Is this as heavy as it looks?

05:45.445 --> 05:46.747
‐Oh.
‐It’s heavier.

over your right shoulder.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.456
Oh. Oh!

05:56.489 --> 05:58.525
‐That’s also heavy.
‐Yeah.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.362
Oh.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.670
Pry bars in your left hands.

06:16.910 --> 06:20.480
You know, cousin, this is almost
exactly like the outfit

06:20.514 --> 06:24.417
I wore
to my grammar school graduation.

06:24.450 --> 06:26.419
Except, of course,
I had the snorkel.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.922
Get over here.

06:28.955 --> 06:30.423
Alright, give me forty flights.

06:30.456 --> 06:32.458
You know, I‐I‐I’m not
much of a climber.

06:32.492 --> 06:35.028
I‐I’m more an on‐the‐ground
management type.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.096
Go!

06:45.839 --> 06:48.975
You know, chief,
this is going to do wonders

06:49.009 --> 06:50.944
in defining our quads.

06:50.977 --> 06:53.479
[laughing]

06:53.514 --> 06:54.715
‐Shut up!
‐Oh.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.018
One.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.854
[instrumental music]

07:09.262 --> 07:11.497
Hey, cousin,
while you were unconscious

07:11.532 --> 07:14.601
Chief Newton told us
tomorrow he’s going to show us

07:14.635 --> 07:16.703
exactly how close
you can get to the flames

07:16.737 --> 07:19.806
and still keep your eyebrows.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.843
I am never going back
to that fire station.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.477
Well, cousin,
what about your story?

07:24.511 --> 07:25.946
I’ll get another story.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.881
Well, what about your commitment
to the community?

07:27.914 --> 07:29.950
I never wanted
to help the community.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.520
‐You didn’t?
‐No.

07:33.554 --> 07:35.889
‐So you lied!
‐Ow! Ow!

07:35.922 --> 07:37.190
Yes, I lied.

07:37.223 --> 07:39.526
But this is the truth,
I am never going back

07:39.560 --> 07:41.828
to that fire station
ever ever again.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.530
Well, I’m going back.

07:43.564 --> 07:46.900
Ain’t no mountain high enough

07:46.933 --> 07:51.938
ain’t no river deep enough,
ain’t no fire hot enough

07:51.972 --> 07:55.041
to keep me
from getting that hat.

07:56.777 --> 07:57.978
Now I’m going to my room.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.045
I want you to sit right there

07:59.079 --> 08:01.515
and think about
what you’re doing, young man.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.589
[knock on door]

08:15.562 --> 08:16.697
‐Hi, Larry.
‐Oh, hi.

08:16.730 --> 08:19.566
Larry, is it true you’ve become
a volunteer fireman?

08:19.600 --> 08:20.501
‐Well, I‐‐
‐Larry.

08:20.534 --> 08:21.935
There’s something
I have to tell you.

08:21.968 --> 08:25.238
Uh, maybe I shouldn’t.
I feel so foolish.

08:25.271 --> 08:27.207
Well, Jennifer,
you can tell me anything.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.975
Here. Come in, come in.

08:30.711 --> 08:34.179
We’re engaged.
You can tell me anything.

08:34.214 --> 08:37.618
I told you
about my fear of eggs.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.921
Okay.

08:40.953 --> 08:44.256
I’ve always had
this fantasy about firemen.

08:44.290 --> 08:46.960
I see this dashing man
in a soot‐streaked slicker.

08:46.993 --> 08:48.595
Silhouetted by a raging fire

08:48.629 --> 08:50.864
he hacks his way
into my bedroom with an axe.

08:50.897 --> 08:52.999
He scoops me up in his arms...

08:53.033 --> 08:54.901
I’ve said too much?

08:54.935 --> 08:56.770
No, no, you‐you haven’t.

08:57.938 --> 09:00.006
He carries me to safety.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.677
He leans me against his truck,
the rungs of his ladder

09:03.710 --> 09:06.747
pressing against my back...
I can’t go on.

09:08.782 --> 09:09.850
Try.

09:11.117 --> 09:13.153
There was always
one thing missing.

09:13.186 --> 09:16.990
My fireman was faceless
until now.

09:17.023 --> 09:20.026
Larry, you’re that face
in my fantasy.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.270
Well, I better be going.

09:34.307 --> 09:37.010
I, uh, just wanted
to share that with you.

09:37.043 --> 09:38.579
I’m glad you did.

09:54.661 --> 09:57.063
Okay, cousin, I’ve made a list
of the pros and cons

09:57.097 --> 09:58.799
of going back to that f...

10:00.366 --> 10:04.137
To that firehouse
and serving your community.

10:04.170 --> 10:06.907
Now I, I don’t care
if I have to stay up all night

10:06.940 --> 10:07.974
I’m going to get
you to do this!

10:08.008 --> 10:09.042
‐I’ll do it.
‐Don’t you fight me on this!

10:09.075 --> 10:13.379
It’s gonna make you
a better person, dagnabit!

10:13.413 --> 10:15.215
I’ll go back.
I’ll serve the community.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.217
I’ll be a volunteer fireman.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.823
Well, feed me lemons
and make me pucker.

It’s so high.

11:07.934 --> 11:11.104
Cousin, come on, you’re holding
on too tight. Loosen your grip.

11:13.039 --> 11:14.207
Oh!

11:15.976 --> 11:17.177
Come on, cousin,
I help you up.

11:18.378 --> 11:19.245
Oh!

11:20.981 --> 11:23.850
‐Come on, cousin, let me‐‐
‐Wait, no, no!

11:28.522 --> 11:29.923
I can get up!

11:32.125 --> 11:34.094
Alright, we start in five.
Look sharp, men.

11:34.127 --> 11:37.063
Oh, sir, I’d look
a lot sharper with a hat!

Alright, everybody on the truck!
We got a fire to fight!

11:45.305 --> 11:47.073
Oh, where do I sit, sir?

11:47.107 --> 11:49.876
‐You’re not going anywhere.
‐Oh, but, yeah, yes...

11:51.377 --> 11:53.747
No! But, please! I want to!

11:53.780 --> 11:55.415
I want to ride
on the fire truck!

11:55.448 --> 11:57.417
It’s been my dream
since yesterday!

11:57.450 --> 11:59.152
You’re not gonna go anywhere!
You’re staying right here!

11:59.185 --> 12:01.154
No, no!

12:01.187 --> 12:03.957
Oh. Oh, look, cousin, they’re
doing the fireman’s carry!

Sit there!

12:07.493 --> 12:08.829

‐Stay!

[fire truck siren blaring]

12:19.472 --> 12:21.374
It isn’t fair, they get
to put on their hats

12:21.407 --> 12:23.043
and go fight a fire.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.444
Those lucky charms!

12:26.379 --> 12:28.982
Yeah, life is tough.

12:29.015 --> 12:30.751
I’m gonna go make some coffee.

‐Hi, Balki.
‐Mary Anne!

’What are you doing here?’

12:40.360 --> 12:41.795

’Oh, we just happened to be’

12:41.828 --> 12:43.163
’in the neighborhood.’

12:43.196 --> 12:44.330
No, we weren’t.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.932
We were clean across town
when you said

12:45.966 --> 12:47.901
"I’ve just got to get
to that firehouse!"

12:49.069 --> 12:51.004
Well, I’m glad you’re here

12:51.037 --> 12:53.807
but you’re going
to be disappointed.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.076
I don’t get my hat
for another four days.

12:59.412 --> 13:00.847
Balki...

13:04.484 --> 13:06.520
...I just finished
my heat tolerance test.

13:08.288 --> 13:11.224
I’ll be ready when I have
to fight a towering inferno.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.528
Oh, Jennifer, Mary Anne.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.264
I didn’t know you were here.

13:21.535 --> 13:23.003
Too bad you didn’t
get here sooner.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.370
You missed all the excitement.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.439
Listen,
the‐the‐the alarm went off

13:26.472 --> 13:28.509
and the siren was‐was wailing

13:28.542 --> 13:30.110
and everybody jumped
on the truck

13:30.143 --> 13:31.845
and race off to fight the fire

13:31.878 --> 13:35.315
and then they say that we have
to stay here and sit in chairs.

13:36.950 --> 13:39.252
What Balki means is
that we were told to stay here

13:39.285 --> 13:41.955
and take care of any
incoming emergencies.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.057
Chief Newton is saving us
for the big fires.

13:45.391 --> 13:47.561
The raging blazes.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.600
Larry, you look wonderful.

13:55.201 --> 13:58.338
Well, you know what they say

13:58.371 --> 13:59.906
clothes make the man.

14:01.407 --> 14:03.544
Of course, I don’t
have to tell you that.

14:06.112 --> 14:07.914
Balki, what’s up there?

14:07.948 --> 14:10.617
Oh, the other end
of that pole.

14:12.318 --> 14:14.254
‐Do you want to see?
‐Uh‐huh.

14:19.325 --> 14:22.095
I love the uniform, Larry.

14:22.128 --> 14:25.866
By the way, I had that dream
again last night.

14:31.572 --> 14:33.073
I’m on duty, you know.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.276
I was left in charge.

14:36.309 --> 14:39.580
Neither rain nor snow
nor sleet nor hail

14:39.613 --> 14:42.549
nor gloom of night shall stay
this trusted firefighter

14:42.583 --> 14:45.652
from the swift completion
of his appointed rounds.

14:47.187 --> 14:49.155
Isn’t that the mailman’s creed?

14:51.391 --> 14:52.626
Well, they use it too.

14:55.629 --> 14:58.464
Can I show you
the officer transportation unit?

14:59.600 --> 15:02.302
‐What?
‐The fire pole.

15:08.208 --> 15:11.177
It may look deceptively simple

15:11.211 --> 15:14.681
but this firefighter
can tell you from experience

15:14.715 --> 15:17.317
that the pole slide
is one of the most

15:17.350 --> 15:19.352
difficult maneuvers to master.

15:19.385 --> 15:21.087
Whee!

15:23.757 --> 15:25.559
She didn’t do it by the book.

15:33.734 --> 15:35.969
Well, we don’t want
to stop an important man

15:36.002 --> 15:38.404
from doing a very important job.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.406
I’m so proud of you, Larry.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.613
We better go.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.654
Doesn’t Larry look handsome
in his uniform?

15:53.687 --> 15:56.623
He sure does.
And he should always wear a hat.

15:56.657 --> 15:59.125
It covers his oddly‐shaped head.

16:04.030 --> 16:06.232
Boy, Jennifer
was really impressed.

16:06.266 --> 16:09.002
Imagine how proud she’ll be
when you fight a real fire?

16:09.035 --> 16:11.037
Fight a fire?
Who needs a fire?

16:11.071 --> 16:13.306
Look at the reaction
I’m getting with just a uniform!

16:17.744 --> 16:21.147
Cousin...I smell smoke.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.517
Well, of course you smell smoke.
We’re in a fire station.

16:23.550 --> 16:26.286
Everything in here
reeks of smoke.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.388
No, no, it’s getting stronger.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.290
Come on.
We’d better check it out.

16:35.361 --> 16:38.498
Cousin, Mr. Coffee’s on fire!

16:38.532 --> 16:40.433
Oh, my Lord!

16:40.466 --> 16:41.535
We’ve got to call for help!

16:41.568 --> 16:46.372
Help! Help!

16:46.406 --> 16:49.175
’Help! Help!’

16:49.209 --> 16:51.612
’Help! Help!’

16:51.645 --> 16:53.547
[telephone rings]

16:53.580 --> 16:55.381
Incoming emergency!

16:59.620 --> 17:00.754
Hello, fire department.

17:00.787 --> 17:04.357
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hello.
Please, the place is on fire!

17:04.390 --> 17:05.458
You gotta come quick!

17:05.491 --> 17:07.193
Alright, alright, don’t panic!

17:07.227 --> 17:09.362
Just‐just keep your cool.
We‐we’re here to help you.

17:09.395 --> 17:12.833
Now‐now‐now,
wh‐where are you located?

17:12.866 --> 17:14.267
‐Balki!
‐Just a second, cousin.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.636
‐Balki!
‐Just a second, cousin!

17:15.669 --> 17:16.837
‐Balki!
‐Cousin, just a second!

17:16.869 --> 17:18.104
I’m on the phone!

17:18.137 --> 17:19.305
What is the address here?

17:19.339 --> 17:21.608
I’m sorry,
I’ve got an idiot here.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.412
921, Bay Ridge Avenue.

17:26.445 --> 17:28.715
921, Bay Ridge Avenue.

17:28.749 --> 17:30.751
Get out of the city!

17:32.352 --> 17:34.320
That’s where our fire is!

17:38.759 --> 17:40.493
‐Balki?
‐Hello?

17:40.527 --> 17:42.362
‐Balki.
‐Just a second, cousin.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.099
Hello?

17:48.134 --> 17:49.536
He hung up.

17:51.872 --> 17:54.741
Balki! Balki, the hose!
Help me with the hose!

17:58.278 --> 17:59.445
Whoa!

18:02.616 --> 18:04.150
[panting]

18:04.184 --> 18:05.619
‐Turn on the water!
‐I cannot, cousin.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.788
‐I’m holding the hose.
‐No, I’m holding the hose.

18:11.658 --> 18:12.693
Balki!

18:14.928 --> 18:17.430
‐Coffee, cousin!
‐Not now, thank you.

18:23.704 --> 18:27.808
Balki, you’re a genius!
You saved us!

18:27.841 --> 18:30.310
Well, cousin,
it was just a simple matter

18:30.343 --> 18:32.445
of fighting fire with Folgers.

18:34.648 --> 18:37.250
Well, the important thing is
it’s out.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.885
Of course,
we’ll have to make more coffee.

18:38.919 --> 18:40.453
But I can handle that.

18:42.723 --> 18:44.390
[screaming]

18:44.424 --> 18:46.459
‐What are we gonna do?
‐Oh, uh, cousin, look!

18:46.492 --> 18:47.794
There’s a fire squisher!

18:58.705 --> 18:59.806
Whoo!

18:59.840 --> 19:01.842
[exhales]
There.

19:02.909 --> 19:05.512
Crisis averted.

19:05.546 --> 19:08.381
Cousin, we make a great team,
don’t we?

19:08.414 --> 19:10.183
You light ’em, we fight ’em.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.521
Well, when you’re
in an emergency

19:14.555 --> 19:18.759
with Larry Appleton,
you can count on a cool head

19:18.792 --> 19:20.594
and a steady hand.

19:22.563 --> 19:25.532
[screaming]

19:26.833 --> 19:29.302
Balki! Balki!

19:31.705 --> 19:33.607
Mighty Max can save us!

19:33.640 --> 19:37.243
No, cousin, no, no.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.712
We‐we‐we cannot...
No, no, don’t touch it.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.013
Chief Newton say that
if we touch it

19:40.046 --> 19:43.717
we’ll be out of the program,
and‐and I won’t get my hat.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.686
Balki, if we don’t touch it,
the fire station

19:45.719 --> 19:47.954
will burn to the ground,
and you won’t have a head!

19:47.988 --> 19:49.523
Alright,
that’s a good point. Let’s go.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.794
Maybe this, maybe this,
maybe, maybe this...

19:53.827 --> 19:56.730
Do you see anything marked "On?"

19:56.763 --> 19:59.299
Well, I don’t know, cousin,
but if this was a clock radio

19:59.332 --> 20:00.634
this would turn it on.

20:05.539 --> 20:07.508
[dramatic music]

20:39.606 --> 20:43.744
Well, Balki,
we saved the fire station.

20:43.777 --> 20:45.879
We’re heroes.

20:45.912 --> 20:49.282
They’re probably
going to give us medals...

20:49.315 --> 20:51.885
...and a parade.

20:51.918 --> 20:55.455
If this don’t get me a hat,
I don’t know what will.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.257
[sighs]

21:04.665 --> 21:07.634
[instrumental music]

21:11.337 --> 21:13.507
Cheer up, Balki, at least
you got to put out a fire

21:13.540 --> 21:15.509
before you were thrown out
of the program.

21:17.844 --> 21:21.782
Yeah, but I never got
to ride on the fire truck

21:21.815 --> 21:23.717
and there’s a big
empty space on my head

21:23.750 --> 21:25.418
where a hat should be.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.022
Well, it wasn’t
a complete loss

21:29.055 --> 21:30.891
you got a nice story out of it.

21:30.924 --> 21:32.593
It was very realistic.

21:32.626 --> 21:35.829
Just reading it
made me smell smoke.

21:35.862 --> 21:38.398
You were burning toast
when you read it, Mary Anne.

21:40.433 --> 21:43.336
Oh, right!

21:43.369 --> 21:46.773
Well, what do you say we all
go out and get some dinner?

21:46.807 --> 21:48.809
‐Great idea.
‐Okay.

21:48.842 --> 21:50.476
We’ll get our coats
and meet you downstairs.

21:50.511 --> 21:51.978
But nothing flambe.

21:57.551 --> 21:59.485
Uh, Balki, it’s, uh,
kind of cold outside.

21:59.520 --> 22:01.454
You might want to wear your hat.

22:01.487 --> 22:04.424
No, cousin, I’ll just...

22:04.457 --> 22:06.426
I’ll just turn my collar up.

22:12.432 --> 22:14.635
Cousin!

22:14.668 --> 22:16.369
My hat!

22:16.402 --> 22:17.938
My hat! Thank you!

22:17.971 --> 22:19.105
Oh!

22:25.512 --> 22:26.780
How you did get it?

22:26.813 --> 22:28.982
Well,
Chief Newton sold it to me.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.585
Unfortunately, he wouldn’t
sell me a uniform.

22:31.618 --> 22:34.120
Oh, that’s okay, cousin,
I don’t need a uniform.

22:34.154 --> 22:35.756
Oh, it wasn’t for you.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.763
I was counting on wearing
it on my honeymoon.

22:44.464 --> 22:47.433
[instrumental music]

22:55.576 --> 22:58.545
[theme music]
