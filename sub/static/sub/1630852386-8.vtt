00:20.895 --> 00:24.357
Emily, Champère was your idea.
We wouldn't be here without you.

00:24.441 --> 00:26.276
I appreciate you saying that.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.737
Well, now that awareness
has been established,

00:28.820 --> 00:31.406
I'd like to pitch you an idea
for a new campaign.

00:31.489 --> 00:34.159
A Champère challenge
that we hope can go viral.

00:36.619 --> 00:37.871
How do you pop your top?

00:38.455 --> 00:41.082
It should feel lo-fi, grassroots,

00:41.166 --> 00:44.127
to make Champère fun and accessible.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.336
An everyday luxury.

00:46.463 --> 00:50.258
We would love to launch it
on Champère's Instagram account next week.

00:50.967 --> 00:53.303
It is really fun, but before we continue,

00:53.928 --> 00:55.180
I need to show you something.

00:56.765 --> 00:58.349
Take a look.

01:04.189 --> 01:07.776
<i>Life is about the pursuit of pleasure.</i>

01:08.985 --> 01:10.904
<i>Won't you join me for a glass?</i>

01:14.991 --> 01:17.994
Je suis Champère.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.122
Oh, my God, he's gone rogue.
He knows he's supposed to spray it, right?

01:21.206 --> 01:22.832
We really need to get him on message.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.794
Emily, you have
given my father an identity,

01:25.877 --> 01:28.046
and now he wants to be
the face of the brand.

01:28.129 --> 01:31.382
He has found himself
in a second-rate champagne.

01:31.466 --> 01:34.761
You can never predict
the course of a man's life.

01:35.345 --> 01:37.847
You know what?
Come to the chateau with me this weekend

01:37.931 --> 01:39.891
and let's make a media with him
we approve.

01:39.974 --> 01:42.519
Well, Dom Perignon has Lady Gaga.

01:43.561 --> 01:45.438
We are Champère.

01:45.522 --> 01:48.525
So who better to promote the brand
than the Champère himself?

01:48.608 --> 01:51.444
Yeah, and with the right twist,
he could become a gay icon.

01:54.364 --> 01:57.242
What? Everybody's looking
for a French daddy.

02:07.418 --> 02:09.671
So when do you think you'll be back?

02:09.754 --> 02:12.006
Just going down for one night.
Get in and get out.

02:13.049 --> 02:16.261
I think it's great that you and Camille
have buried the hatchet.

02:16.344 --> 02:18.054
So, you should stay longer.

02:18.680 --> 02:22.058
Mindy, you and Benoît
can have the apartment any time.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.936
Okay? I'll just go for a long, long walk.

02:25.687 --> 02:26.604
God!

02:27.605 --> 02:30.733
I feel like I'm 15 years old
and back at boarding school.

02:30.817 --> 02:35.071
I mean 17. Whatever.
The point is, I'm actually nervous.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.156


02:36.239 --> 02:39.200
We're playing at Place des Vosges
if you want to come see us?

02:39.284 --> 02:42.370
Alfie and I are having dinner.
But maybe we'll swing by after.

02:42.453 --> 02:44.372
Oh, my God, yay, I can't wait to meet him.

02:44.455 --> 02:47.792
You'll meet him soon. He's on his way
to pick me up in a few minutes.

02:57.719 --> 02:59.429
Alfie's at Gabriel's restaurant!

03:00.013 --> 03:01.055
-Again?
-Again!

03:01.139 --> 03:02.432


03:02.515 --> 03:04.601
Oh, mate, see, that's exactly it.

03:04.684 --> 03:06.936
You had tickets to the final
and you didn't go?

03:07.020 --> 03:08.396
Hey, cheers to you, anyway.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.816
Hey, what are you doing here?

03:11.900 --> 03:15.987
Well, I was early and thirsty,
so I popped over here for a quick beer.

03:16.696 --> 03:19.073
-You drink beer?
-It's Kronenbourg. It's from Alsace.

03:19.157 --> 03:20.158
Yeah, it's not bad.

03:20.241 --> 03:22.535
-Oh, finally we agree on something.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.121
You know this guy's been working
in a kitchen since he was 13?

03:25.205 --> 03:26.664
I mean, peeling potatoes.

03:26.748 --> 03:27.707
I didn't know that.

03:27.790 --> 03:30.335
Um, isn't that against child labor laws
or something?

03:30.418 --> 03:32.045
It was my uncle's kitchen.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.423
Wow. We should put it in the marketing
materials for the restaurant.

03:35.506 --> 03:36.341
Ready?

03:36.424 --> 03:39.385
Actually, I was thinking
we could maybe eat here tonight?

03:39.469 --> 03:41.304
I mean, the food looks amazing.

03:41.387 --> 03:44.307
Oh. I'm sure they're fully booked.

03:44.849 --> 03:47.477
Chef, do you think
you could spare us a table?

03:48.394 --> 03:49.812
It would be my pleasure.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.273
Great.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.153
Mmm.

03:57.695 --> 03:59.364
Damn, this man can cook.

03:59.447 --> 04:01.866
He sure is talented.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.702
I've never really been into French food.
Bit too fussy.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.080
But this… This is outstanding.

04:08.873 --> 04:10.875
Now I understand why you love your work.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.460
I really do.

04:12.543 --> 04:17.090
In fact, tomorrow I'm going to a chateau
in Champagne for a night,

04:17.173 --> 04:20.093
to work on a social media campaign
for a brand we represent.

04:20.176 --> 04:22.428
See, I spend my days
pushing around numbers.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.182
My perk's having dinner with you.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.350
How's the meal?

04:28.309 --> 04:29.477
There's the man.

04:30.186 --> 04:31.396
Truly extraordinary.

04:31.479 --> 04:32.689
Man, you've got skills.

04:34.565 --> 04:38.486
Where did you guys meet?
You're such a cute couple.

04:38.569 --> 04:40.196
Ah. French class.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.074
I thought she was
a little annoying at first.

04:43.157 --> 04:44.409
Likewise.

04:44.492 --> 04:45.952
But she grew on me.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.955
How sweet.

04:49.038 --> 04:52.500
Um, and, I never asked,
what brought you to Paris?

04:52.583 --> 04:53.793
I work for a British bank,

04:53.876 --> 04:56.170
working on this merger deal
with a French company.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.339
Boring stuff.
I mean, she's got the cushy job.

04:59.048 --> 05:01.759
Get this, she's going to Champagne
for work tomorrow.

05:02.343 --> 05:03.303
Really?

05:03.386 --> 05:04.762
-Oh.

05:04.846 --> 05:08.308
That's work right now. Sorry.
I've just got to take this for a second.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.813
I really hope
you're enjoying yourself here.

05:13.896 --> 05:16.816
So you're spending the weekend
in Champagne with Camille?

05:16.899 --> 05:20.069
Hoping for a do-over.
Story of my life, I guess.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.237
Please send her my best.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.824
And, I think I understand your type
a little better now.

05:24.907 --> 05:26.784
English, less complicated.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.412
Yeah, way less complicated.

05:29.495 --> 05:32.290
He doesn't have a girlfriend
I'm also friends with.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.043
-Ah.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.546
<i>Pièce de boeuf,</i> black truffle.

05:40.715 --> 05:44.052
Wow. And this is fourth course?

05:44.135 --> 05:45.845
The final one of our tasting menu.

05:46.637 --> 05:48.598
And not including the cheese course.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.768
And you have to try all of our desserts.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.394
Everything is on the house, of course.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.521
-That's very generous.
-Oh, pfft.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.107
Emily doesn't pay here.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.026
Oh. I think I do.

06:03.571 --> 06:07.992
I don't think I've ever felt so full
in my whole, entire life.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.036
-Come here, you.

06:12.830 --> 06:17.460
-I am so, so sorry.

06:17.543 --> 06:20.004
No, it's fine.

06:24.967 --> 06:26.803
Look, after all that food,

06:27.804 --> 06:31.099
I don't think I'm good for anything else
but sleep tonight.

06:31.682 --> 06:34.268
Yeah, no, and I have
an early morning tomorrow.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.187
So it's probably for the best.

06:36.270 --> 06:38.398
But I'll see you when you're back. Yeah?

06:38.981 --> 06:39.982
Absolutely.

06:42.902 --> 06:43.736
You!

06:49.117 --> 06:50.326
Wow.

06:50.868 --> 06:52.286
Take care, yeah?

06:52.370 --> 06:53.621
-Have a good time.
-Bye.

07:22.525 --> 07:25.027
Oh, hello, Emily!

07:25.611 --> 07:27.530
So nice to see you back in Champagne.

07:27.613 --> 07:28.865
<i>Bonjour.</i>

07:29.907 --> 07:32.869
The Champère is ready for his close-up.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.495
Hello!

07:34.579 --> 07:37.081
Actually, Dad, Emily had an amazing idea.

07:37.165 --> 07:40.960
She wants you
to kick off The Champère Challenge.

07:42.128 --> 07:45.089
It's a viral campaign where
we're asking our customers to show us

07:45.173 --> 07:47.842
the most creative ways
of opening a bottle of Champère.

07:47.925 --> 07:52.305
It's like an online competition.
How Do You Pop Your Top?

07:52.388 --> 07:53.598
Ooh.

07:54.599 --> 07:55.933
I love it!

07:57.727 --> 08:01.981
And I have the most amazing way
of opening the bottle.

08:02.064 --> 08:03.649
I can't wait to show you.

08:04.775 --> 08:05.776
That's her.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.445
Let's get these to your room.

08:07.528 --> 08:09.071
-Hi, Emily.
-Oh.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.281
<i>Bonjour.</i>

08:10.364 --> 08:12.074
I was hoping I'd see you again.

08:17.538 --> 08:18.789
Friends from school.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.838
You see, I just cut my hair.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.216
Yeah, it looks really nice.

08:28.841 --> 08:29.926
-Thank you.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.179
<i>Oui?</i>

08:34.096 --> 08:36.557
I am from the newspaper
<i>Liberation Champagne</i>

08:37.558 --> 08:40.144
here to cover the Champagne Challenge.

08:40.228 --> 08:45.191
Oh! Oui, oui. Uh, <i>La Liberation Champagne.</i>
<i>Merci</i> for coming.

08:45.274 --> 08:47.777
Oh! <i>Ici! Le Champère.</i>

08:48.486 --> 08:51.531
<i>-Monsieur.</i>
-Ooh! The light is perfect!

08:51.614 --> 08:54.825
-Let's get started!
-Oh, là là. I'm out of here.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.536
Let's go.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.547
-What flavor would you like?
-Uh, raspberry.

09:07.630 --> 09:08.464
Ah.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.050
She'd like the raspberry.

09:11.759 --> 09:14.929
Uh, and I'll have the lemon.

09:15.513 --> 09:19.433
So you speak Italian
as well as English, French and Dutch?

09:19.517 --> 09:21.394
And German and a little Japanese.

09:21.477 --> 09:22.395
-Wow.

09:22.478 --> 09:23.854
If you're from the Netherlands,

09:23.938 --> 09:25.982
you'd better learn
to speak a lot of languages

09:26.065 --> 09:27.900
-because nobody speaks Dutch.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.861
Here you are.
And this is for the beautiful lady.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.363
<i>-Grazie.</i>
<i>-Grazie.</i>

09:32.863 --> 09:33.906
And you?

09:33.990 --> 09:38.619
I speak English, French, Italian
and a little Spanish.

09:39.704 --> 09:42.707
But I'm
a much nicer person in Italian.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.125
Warmer, friendlier.

09:45.960 --> 09:49.755
I love how our personalities change
when we speak different languages.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.466
You're Italian is beautiful.

09:52.550 --> 09:55.303
Thank you. I lived in Rome for a while.

09:56.262 --> 10:00.391
Which, next to Paris,
is the most beautiful city in the world.

10:00.474 --> 10:02.643
Rome may be
my favorite city, period.

10:03.227 --> 10:06.564
A perfect combination of art,
architecture, food.

10:06.647 --> 10:08.316
And the light is just incredible.

10:08.399 --> 10:09.859
<i>Si, la dolce vita.</i>

10:11.068 --> 10:12.903
We should spend
the weekend there together.

10:12.987 --> 10:15.698
Yes, I could dance in the Fontana di Trevi

10:15.781 --> 10:17.825
-like Anita Ekberg.

10:17.908 --> 10:20.578
And I'll come join you
like Marcello Mastroianni.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.413
I'm going to hold you to that.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.044
What are you doing tomorrow?

10:29.253 --> 10:30.921
What do you have in mind?

10:31.005 --> 10:34.008
A good friend of mine
is having a small engagement party.

10:34.091 --> 10:37.637
A lunch at La Société in Saint-Germain.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.055
I'd love you to join me.

10:39.764 --> 10:40.598
Hmm.

10:41.515 --> 10:42.933
What will your friends think

10:43.017 --> 10:46.395
of this very interesting woman
you're seeing right now?

10:47.146 --> 10:48.564
They're going to be jealous.

10:55.821 --> 10:56.656
Sylvie?

10:58.407 --> 11:00.284
Oh! What a surprise!

11:00.910 --> 11:03.996
Nice to see you both.
You look beautiful, Catherine.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.623
As do you, Sylvie.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.171
Are you going to introduce us
to your friend?

11:14.131 --> 11:16.050
-Erik DeGroot.
-Catherine Lambert.

11:17.510 --> 11:22.223
Erik is a very talented photographer
who has done some wonderful work for us.

11:22.306 --> 11:24.517
Antoine is the owner of Maison Lavaux

11:24.600 --> 11:26.227
and a longtime client of Savoir.

11:26.894 --> 11:28.896
I know it. The perfume.

11:29.605 --> 11:30.439
Exactly.

11:31.607 --> 11:34.318
Hopefully we will all be
working together someday.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.445
It would be my honor.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.157
Well, have a nice lunch.

11:40.741 --> 11:42.201
Thanks. Have a good day.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.833
I'm very sorry
if that was awkward,

11:48.916 --> 11:51.961
but I just like to keep
my personal life private around clients.

11:52.837 --> 11:53.838
I understand.

11:55.464 --> 11:57.591
And I'm sure your friends are very lovely,

11:57.675 --> 11:59.635
but I don't think
I can make lunch tomorrow.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.553
Why?

12:01.846 --> 12:04.640
I love it just you and me.
Let's not get the world involved.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.476
So you want me as your secret lover?

12:08.686 --> 12:10.020
Well, that sounds hot.

12:11.021 --> 12:12.022
Not to me.

12:14.316 --> 12:16.986
Why don't you enjoy your friend's party
and come over after?

12:17.069 --> 12:18.571
We could spend the night together.

12:18.654 --> 12:20.990
Yeah, I'm not sure
that's going to work for me.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.409
I have a lot of work
to catch up on tomorrow.

12:29.874 --> 12:32.918
Oh, okay. That looks great.
Yes, right there. That looks great.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.462
I just need a moment to set up.

12:34.545 --> 12:35.546
-Of course.
-Okay.

12:42.928 --> 12:46.265
I have a very special way
of opening the bottle.

12:46.348 --> 12:48.017
Great, I can't wait to see.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.854
What are you smiling about?

12:51.937 --> 12:55.149
Oh, it's just this British guy that
I'm kind of dating from my French class.

12:55.232 --> 12:57.735
Emily, why didn't you tell me?
Let me see him.

12:59.987 --> 13:01.405
Oh, my God, he's so hot!

13:01.489 --> 13:03.282
And he's pretty sweet and funny too.

13:03.365 --> 13:04.408
I'm happy for you.

13:05.409 --> 13:06.744
-I'm ready.
-Okay.

13:07.244 --> 13:08.746
All right, Gérard, let's see it!

13:08.829 --> 13:10.581
Timothée, my sword.

13:11.332 --> 13:13.417
My dad,
he could do this all day, loves it.

13:15.044 --> 13:17.171
-Wow!

13:17.254 --> 13:18.422
I love it!

13:18.506 --> 13:20.925
Okay, so can we now do one where you say,

13:21.008 --> 13:23.803
<i>"Je suis le Champère,</i>
and this is how I pop my top"?

13:23.886 --> 13:27.848
-Then do the thing with the sword.
-Okay. Timothée, another bottle.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.853
Okay, and action!

13:32.937 --> 13:38.442
<i>Je suis le Champère,</i>
and this is how I pop my top.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.070
Ah, okay.

13:42.863 --> 13:43.864
Oh, damn.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.827
Uh, I'm sorry, it wasn't recording.

13:47.910 --> 13:48.744
Timothée…

13:48.828 --> 13:51.288
Don't worry about it.
He can do this all day long.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.502
Okay, I am definitely recording now.

13:56.585 --> 14:01.465
<i>Je suis le Champère,</i>
and this is how I pop my top.

14:05.803 --> 14:08.347
Timothée! My finger.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.144
Emily, help me find the finger.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.735
Ah! Oh, oh, it's there, I see it.

14:26.574 --> 14:30.244
Take this. And come with us.
We need to get him to the hospital.

14:32.371 --> 14:33.998
Let's go! Hurry up!

14:34.456 --> 14:35.332
Make it fast!

14:35.416 --> 14:37.543
Watch your head. Watch.

14:39.003 --> 14:39.879
Okay.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.463
He's very lucky. Just the tip.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.716
-Good.
-To the hospital. I'll show you where.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.593
-I'm driving?
-Yes, please.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.848
It's a stick! Um…

14:51.891 --> 14:53.726
I've only driven one. In high school.

14:53.809 --> 14:55.853
My boyfriend's car.
I never got the hang of it.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.938
Yeah, okay, please, go, Emily.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.816
-Turn the key! Go, go!
-Okay, okay!

15:09.992 --> 15:10.826
Chef?

15:10.910 --> 15:12.494
I want to show this to you.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.413
A strange story popped up on my Instagram.

15:14.496 --> 15:15.915
Isn't this your friend's family?

15:19.960 --> 15:22.296
Thank God, Timothée.
I'll tell Mama right away.

15:23.631 --> 15:24.465
Mom!

15:29.178 --> 15:30.220
That was Timothée.

15:30.971 --> 15:32.181
Papa is fine.

15:33.265 --> 15:34.642
I knew he would be.

15:35.267 --> 15:38.562
Ah, I warned him this would
happen someday. But he doesn't listen.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.022
I'm just happy he's okay.

15:44.818 --> 15:45.653
Hello?

15:45.736 --> 15:46.820
Louise, it's Gabriel.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.073
I just heard the news about Gérard.
How is he?

15:51.575 --> 15:53.661
He's in the hospital, Gabriel.

15:53.744 --> 15:57.706
It was a little irresponsible of Emily
to ask him to do such a dangerous stunt.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.625
Please tell him I'm thinking about him.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.961
Do you know what would
make him really happy?

16:02.044 --> 16:04.797
If you could come down here
and tell him yourself.

16:06.006 --> 16:07.007
I'll see what I can do.

16:07.091 --> 16:08.926
<i>Wonderful. See you at dinner.</i>

16:13.138 --> 16:16.892
Raphaël, the kitchen's all yours
for the night.

16:42.960 --> 16:48.048
Je suis le Champère,
<i>and this is how I pop my top.</i>

17:25.878 --> 17:27.337
Emily, you're up.

17:27.421 --> 17:30.758
I'm sorry, I guess I slept through dinner.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.593
No, it's okay. I didn't want to wake you.

17:32.676 --> 17:34.011
But look who's here!

17:34.887 --> 17:36.597
I saw the post about the accident.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.849
It's nothing. Just the tip of my finger.

17:38.932 --> 17:41.060
It happens to chefs all the time.
Louise said--

17:41.143 --> 17:43.854
It doesn't matter.
It's just nice that you're here.

17:45.522 --> 17:46.732
Emily, please have a seat.

17:46.815 --> 17:49.568
I'll get you some dinner
if these men haven't finished it all.

17:49.651 --> 17:51.570
-No, it's fine. I'll get it.
-Emily!

17:51.653 --> 17:54.156
Next time, let's put
the neck of the bottle in a guillotine.

17:54.239 --> 17:55.282
No, no.

17:55.365 --> 17:57.868
You can be the executioner.

18:07.711 --> 18:09.296
-Yes?
-It's Camille.

18:09.379 --> 18:10.589
Ah.

18:10.672 --> 18:12.132
What a day.

18:12.216 --> 18:13.675
Oh.

18:17.387 --> 18:19.848
It's so nice that Gabriel came down.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.392
-He was so worried.
-I'm sure he was.

18:22.476 --> 18:27.815
So, tell me about your gorgeous new man.
When do I get to meet him?

18:27.898 --> 18:31.360
Soon. It just happened
so quickly and unexpectedly.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.362
Well, it's always the best way.

18:34.947 --> 18:35.864
Who is it?

18:39.409 --> 18:41.078
Here you both are.

18:41.161 --> 18:42.871
Here we are.

18:45.541 --> 18:48.210
It's Emily's room,
so were you looking for both of us?

18:49.711 --> 18:51.046
Yeah. To say goodnight.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.048
Oh.

18:53.590 --> 18:54.591
Join us.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.303
I seriously cannot believe
your dad cut his thumb off.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.013
Oh. I can.

19:00.514 --> 19:02.474
You know how long
he's been doing that trick?

19:02.558 --> 19:04.518
Of course it was
going to catch up with him.

19:04.601 --> 19:07.688
Yeah, and under my watch. Lucky me.

19:07.771 --> 19:09.648
There was so much blood
it hit me in the face.

19:09.731 --> 19:11.650
-No.
-Yes, and Camille fainted.

19:12.568 --> 19:13.819
-You know me.
-Yeah.

19:13.902 --> 19:15.988
I can't stand the sight of blood, anyway.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.240
Thank you for coming.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.492
It means a lot to all of us.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.286
Well, I was worried.

19:22.369 --> 19:24.329
You know how much
I care about your family.

19:25.122 --> 19:26.790
And they care about you, Gabriel.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.125
I hope you know that.

19:28.208 --> 19:29.459
I do.

19:30.919 --> 19:34.047
It's also nice to be back in this house.
I always sleep so well here.

19:35.340 --> 19:38.969
Well, maybe it has something to do
with who you were sleeping with.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.305
Let's see how you do alone.

19:42.222 --> 19:45.517
-Yeah.
-Um, I think I'm going to get some sleep.

19:46.518 --> 19:47.352
Me too.

19:48.729 --> 19:49.730
Goodnight, you two.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.279
Yeah, this is actually my room.

19:57.362 --> 19:58.280
Yep.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.784
-Goodnight.
-Bye.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.216
<i>Oui.</i>

20:17.299 --> 20:19.301
Catherine would like
to invite you to dinner.

20:19.384 --> 20:20.552
You and your boyfriend.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.305
I thought it was clear
when I introduced him.

20:23.388 --> 20:24.765
He's not my boyfriend.

20:24.848 --> 20:27.517
I'm glad to hear that
because it looks a little silly on you.

20:27.601 --> 20:28.518
Excuse me?

20:28.602 --> 20:30.437
I mean, what are you trying to prove here?

20:30.520 --> 20:31.813
Why do you care?

20:31.897 --> 20:33.607
Because I still care about you, Sylvie.

20:33.690 --> 20:36.485
You know what? Start caring a little less.

20:36.568 --> 20:37.903
<i>And for the record,</i>

20:37.986 --> 20:41.281
I could give a flying fuck
how silly I look to you.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.406
Sorry I'm late.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.411
No. You're just in time.

21:27.494 --> 21:30.122
-Everyone, this is Sylvie.
-Hello. Hi.

21:30.205 --> 21:33.625
Mystery solved! I'm Julianna.
I'm so happy you could make it.

21:33.709 --> 21:37.462
Oh, thank you. Congratulations
on your engagement.

21:37.546 --> 21:40.007
Please, sit here. I'll find another chair.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.216
Thank you.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.010
The traffic was terrible.

21:43.552 --> 21:46.555
-May I take your order?
-I'll have the salmon. Yeah.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.849
And what will your son
be having for lunch?

21:53.270 --> 21:56.064
My son will be having me.

22:45.322 --> 22:46.823
Are you sure you want to go now?

22:46.907 --> 22:49.576
We can give you a ride later with Gabriel,
if you want.

22:49.659 --> 22:52.788
That's okay. I'd rather take the train
and get home as soon as possible.

22:52.871 --> 22:55.457
To, you know,
think of a new Champère campaign.

22:55.540 --> 22:56.375
All right.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.001
Oh, let me get that.

22:58.085 --> 22:58.919
Thanks.

23:01.004 --> 23:03.173
Please tell your father
I hope he feels better.

23:03.256 --> 23:04.341
Yeah, I will.

23:04.424 --> 23:05.258
Sorry.

23:09.930 --> 23:12.974
Bye-bye, Emily!

23:13.809 --> 23:15.727
Bye-bye!

23:33.286 --> 23:35.122
-You're leaving?
-Yeah.

23:37.082 --> 23:38.708
It was so nice to see you again.

23:40.419 --> 23:43.964
But I've been thinking…
It's maybe time for us to move on.

23:45.257 --> 23:48.343
Yeah. I think
that's probably for the best.
