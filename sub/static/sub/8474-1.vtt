00:42.875 --> 00:45.211
My name is Dalton Russell.

00:46.003 --> 00:47.963
Pay strict attention to what I say

00:48.047 --> 00:51.884
because I choose my words carefully
and I never repeat myself.

00:52.051 --> 00:54.970
I've told you my name. That's the "who. "

00:56.430 --> 01:00.226
The "where" could most readily
be described as a prison cell.

01:00.726 --> 01:02.019
<i>But there's a vast difference</i>

01:02.102 --> 01:05.814
<i>between being stuck in a tiny cell
and being in prison.</i>

01:07.191 --> 01:08.943
The "what" is easy.

01:09.610 --> 01:14.448
Recently I planned and set in motion
events to execute the perfect bank robbery.

01:15.157 --> 01:17.117
That's also the "when. "

01:17.660 --> 01:21.872
As for the "why,"
beyond the obvious financial motivation,

01:22.456 --> 01:24.416
it's exceedingly simple.

01:25.459 --> 01:27.002
Because I can.

01:28.170 --> 01:30.714
Which leaves us only with the "how. "

01:31.090 --> 01:34.009
And therein, as the Bard would tell us,

01:35.302 --> 01:36.762
lies the rub.

04:54.168 --> 04:56.170
So, your mother tells me about

04:57.713 --> 05:01.884
a certain young lady who's helping you
with the Triborough Bridge project?

05:02.259 --> 05:04.011
- Okay?
- All right, okay.

05:04.970 --> 05:06.096
He's crazy.

05:10.893 --> 05:13.312
- Now? On 51st? 50...
Yeah, that's where he is right now.

05:13.395 --> 05:17.441
He's on 40, he... No, he's still on 47th Street,
but it's a much smaller space.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.276
What do I have to...

05:21.028 --> 05:24.532
Yeah, we'll get lobster.
I'll put it on Mr Ansinori's card.

05:24.615 --> 05:28.577
Whatever. It's a meeting
with one of his clients or something.

05:30.287 --> 05:33.415
Because it's been like over a year now.
Yeah.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.712
I want to snap this guy's neck,
I swear to God.

05:41.924 --> 05:43.175
So what?

05:44.468 --> 05:48.013
So what? They're flowers.
They could've been to his grandmother.

05:48.097 --> 05:50.975
They could've been to me.
It's my birthday, so...

05:53.352 --> 05:55.354
Okay, so maybe it's a client's.

05:58.107 --> 06:00.192
Okay. This is funny.

06:00.526 --> 06:04.280
I got this guy in front of me
that thinks I don't see him looking at me.

06:04.363 --> 06:07.616
Fantastic. God damn it.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.285
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

06:09.785 --> 06:11.954
Can you lower your voice
just a little bit, please?

06:12.037 --> 06:14.957
You're getting a little loud on your phone.
Please.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.292
Yeah. Fine.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.127
I don't want you
disturbing the other customers.

06:18.210 --> 06:19.461
- Sorry.
- All right?

06:19.545 --> 06:21.463
- Yeah, you got it.
- Thank you.

06:23.299 --> 06:25.176
It was a security guy.

06:25.259 --> 06:28.470
I didn't know I was in a library.
It's a fucking bank.

06:28.554 --> 06:30.139
Manhattan Trust.

06:33.517 --> 06:37.146
...from Yale.
And this fucking rich prick I work for.

06:41.442 --> 06:42.776
Thank you.

06:54.872 --> 06:56.749
Excuse me. Sir?

06:57.041 --> 06:58.167
Easy.

06:58.626 --> 07:01.712
Everybody get down on the fucking floor!
Now!

07:03.923 --> 07:05.341
Get down on the ground!

07:05.424 --> 07:09.261
You have four seconds!
Anyone still standing gets shot!

07:09.512 --> 07:12.765
One! Two! Three!

07:12.848 --> 07:16.519
Back away from that counter!
Get your hand away from that button!

07:17.520 --> 07:19.688
Put your hands on the floor! Now!

07:19.772 --> 07:21.607
Oh... What the... What is this?

07:21.690 --> 07:24.026
- Todd, what are we gonna do?
- What the fuck do you want me to do?

07:24.109 --> 07:26.195
Keep your head down, fat man!
- All right!

07:26.278 --> 07:28.739
Get your fucking face on the floor!

07:31.367 --> 07:34.370
You get the same treatment
as everyone else, Rabbi.

07:34.745 --> 07:35.913
Get down.

07:40.334 --> 07:43.295
Now, my friends and I are making

07:43.379 --> 07:46.090
a very large withdrawal from this bank.

07:46.507 --> 07:50.761
Anybody gets in our way
gets a bullet in the brain.

07:52.888 --> 07:55.349
Lie down, old man!
Put your fucking hands down!

07:55.432 --> 07:58.894
Get your face on the floor.
All right, I'm down! I'm down!

08:02.106 --> 08:04.942
Hey, Officer,
there's smoke coming out of there.

08:17.371 --> 08:21.208
Possible 10-30. Manhattan Trust.
20 Exchange Place.

08:21.292 --> 08:23.085
I have got hostages.

08:23.502 --> 08:27.131
You fucking cops come near this door,
I start killing people.

08:27.464 --> 08:29.341
I not fucking kidding, man.

08:35.681 --> 08:37.349
Central. Give me an 85.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.184
Back up, sir! Back up! You!

08:39.268 --> 08:40.644
Shit!
- Back up! Back up!

08:40.727 --> 08:42.270
Stay around the corner!

08:42.354 --> 08:44.315
Central, give me an 85.

08:44.398 --> 08:46.650
Perp with a gun. Possible hostages.

08:46.734 --> 08:50.029
I repeat, possible hostages.
20 Exchange. Manhattan Trust.

08:50.112 --> 08:51.780
Baby, I'm fighting for my life over here.

08:51.864 --> 08:54.825
Keith, every time we have this conversation,
it's the same thing.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.160
<i>- "Not now. "
- Listen. Listen.</i>

08:56.243 --> 08:58.412
Do you know what kind of thin ice
I'm on right now

08:58.495 --> 09:00.539
with this cheque-cashing thing?
They want to lock me up.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.833
<i>If this $140,000 doesn't show up
somewhere soon,</i>

09:02.917 --> 09:05.169
<i>- things gonna get rough for me.
- But you didn't take it.</i>

09:05.252 --> 09:08.005
Of course I didn't take it, baby.
It's just some lying drug dealer

09:08.088 --> 09:10.007
trying to save his own ass
by fucking me over.

09:10.090 --> 09:11.842
<i>- Eventually, it'll go away.
- Then what?</i>

09:11.926 --> 09:14.178
<i>- What about us?
- Then, you know, I'll make First Grade</i>

09:14.261 --> 09:17.097
and we'll have enough money
to buy a bigger place and then, you know...

09:17.181 --> 09:19.975
Why we got to have this conversation
every time your brother gets locked up

09:20.059 --> 09:22.978
<i>- or gets caught stealing a car?
- He's the only family I've got.</i>

09:23.062 --> 09:24.980
All right, I'm sorry, baby. You okay?

09:25.064 --> 09:26.690
- You still love me?
- I'm sorry, too.

09:26.774 --> 09:28.359
<i>- You still love me?
- I love you, baby.</i>

09:28.442 --> 09:30.569
All right. Big Willie and the twins for you
when I get home.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.988
- I got the handcuffs.
- I got the gun.

09:33.072 --> 09:34.573
Bye, Big Daddy.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.910
- Big Willie and the twins, huh?
- That's correct.

09:37.993 --> 09:41.872
Her lowlife brother, he's got three priors,
one for armed robbery.

09:41.956 --> 09:45.209
17-year-old high-school dropout.
Doesn't have an honest bone in his body

09:45.292 --> 09:48.587
and he's too fucking stupid
to amount to anything. Even as a criminal.

09:48.671 --> 09:51.006
- Can't you get rid of him?
- I could, couldn't I?

09:51.090 --> 09:53.551
No, she loves him. What am I gonna do?
Put him out in the street?

09:53.634 --> 09:55.219
- How's he feel about you?
- Oh, he's thrilled.

09:55.302 --> 09:57.012
To have a detective
sleeping in the next room,

09:57.096 --> 09:59.306
banging his sister.
Then she tries to bring it all back on me.

09:59.390 --> 10:02.017
You know, "If we had a bigger place,
we wouldn't have this problem. "

10:02.101 --> 10:04.645
Of course, if we got married
then things would be different.

10:04.728 --> 10:07.690
- And what's wrong with that?
- A wedding. Furniture. Kids.

10:07.773 --> 10:09.233
You know what a diamond ring costs?

10:09.316 --> 10:11.735
- Come on, man. You've been married.
- Please. I was 21.

10:11.819 --> 10:15.281
- Yeah, but you give her a ring?
- Yeah, but she won't call me back.

10:15.364 --> 10:18.409
- You guys cops?
- Oh, shit! He made us!

10:18.492 --> 10:20.911
Christmas came early for you this year.

10:20.995 --> 10:24.081
Bank robbery. Hostage situation.
20 Exchange Place.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.292
- What?
- Grossman's on vacation. You're up.

10:26.375 --> 10:29.044
What about the Madrugada thing?
The cheque-cashing thing?

10:29.128 --> 10:31.505
- I thought I was in the doghouse.
- I just threw you a bone.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.299
As far as I'm concerned, you still work here,

10:33.382 --> 10:35.593
- but if you don't think you're ready...
- No, no, he's ready!

10:35.676 --> 10:37.303
Oh, good. Good.

10:37.386 --> 10:39.930
I'm giving you a break, here.
Don't make me look like a fool.

10:40.014 --> 10:42.600
- This is it, baby. The show!
- Yeah.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.268
You got the call, man. God damn!

10:44.351 --> 10:46.896
I guess I should be happy.
I might get to put off I.A.B.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.939
Here's all you need to know.
You walk in unarmed.

10:49.023 --> 10:51.775
Head bad guy puts a gun to your head
and makes you get on your knees.

10:51.859 --> 10:54.570
You look around. There are five armed men
pointing Uzis at you.

10:54.653 --> 10:56.197
Just picture them in their underwear.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.865
How about orange jumpsuits and shackles?

10:57.948 --> 11:02.244
- There you go, Keith. You can do this, man.
- Look out, bad guys. Here I come.

11:26.018 --> 11:28.145
Get back around the corner!
Get back!

11:28.229 --> 11:30.731
I told you, move it! Move it!

11:31.649 --> 11:34.735
Get those people back!
Get them the hell out of here!

11:36.111 --> 11:39.573
All right, guys, as soon as we pull up,
I want everybody out.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.744
The second floor window. Now.

11:44.203 --> 11:47.039
- Let them in there!
- Let's go! Go now!

11:48.916 --> 11:50.292
Sarge, what do you got?

11:50.376 --> 11:53.087
I got a perp in the bank.
Possible hostage situation.

11:53.170 --> 11:54.421
Who's on today? Who's your boss?

11:54.505 --> 11:56.674
- Sergeant Hernandez. I'll get him over here.
- Get him down here.

11:56.757 --> 11:59.176
- Sergeant Hernandez, you on the air?
- On the air. Go.

11:59.260 --> 12:02.012
Sarge, I got Sergeant Collins over here.
He called this in.

12:02.096 --> 12:03.514
Can you come over to the other side?

12:03.597 --> 12:05.850
Redirect, on my way. Let's go.

12:17.695 --> 12:20.155
Back up! Go around,
around the corner.

12:20.239 --> 12:22.533
Pull back. Pull it back.
We got to keep this secure.

12:22.616 --> 12:24.743
- Collins? What you got?
- Hernandez.

12:24.827 --> 12:28.998
I got a perp inside with a gun.
He claims he's got some hostages in there.

12:30.124 --> 12:32.626
Everyone, heads up! Let's clear the way!

12:52.521 --> 12:54.899
Let's go. Set them up. All right.

12:55.524 --> 12:57.568
We've got it under control.

12:58.235 --> 12:59.737
Step back, please!

12:59.820 --> 13:02.072
- Step back!
- Get back! Thank you.

13:02.156 --> 13:04.074
There's nothing going on.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.160
You'll see it on the news tonight.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.912
Step back, please.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.133
Mr Case?

13:21.217 --> 13:23.886
Oh, good morning, Katherine.
What can I do for you?

13:23.969 --> 13:27.181
Sir, there's a robbery in progress
at one of our branches.

13:27.264 --> 13:28.474
Oh, my.

13:28.933 --> 13:32.937
- Has anybody been hurt?
- I don't think so, but there are hostages.

13:33.854 --> 13:35.397
Oh, how awful.

13:36.690 --> 13:40.194
- Which branch is it?
- Number 32. 20 Exchange Place.

13:40.819 --> 13:43.280
- Which one?
- 20 Exchange Place.

13:46.116 --> 13:47.701
Thank you, Katherine.

13:47.785 --> 13:49.537
I'm sorry, Mr Case.

14:01.423 --> 14:02.883
Oh, dear God.

14:05.386 --> 14:08.013
Get these people out of here.
Come on, open these gates. Back up.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.391
Up on the sidewalk. Come on in.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.524
Sergeant Collins, first on scene.
Are you the hostage negotiator?

14:18.607 --> 14:21.318
That's right. Detective Frazier.
This is Detective Mitchell. What do you got?

14:21.402 --> 14:23.320
Not much.
Saw the bank was filled with smoke.

14:23.404 --> 14:25.698
The door was locked.
I tried to take a look inside

14:25.781 --> 14:29.159
and one of the gunmen opens the door,
sticks a.357 in my face,

14:29.243 --> 14:31.829
screaming in some foreign accent
about killing hostages.

14:31.912 --> 14:34.665
- See any other gunmen?
- No, sir. I couldn't see anything at all.

14:34.748 --> 14:36.375
- You hear anything inside?
- No, sir,

14:36.458 --> 14:40.629
but with that. 357 sticking in my face,
I can't really be sure. I'm sorry.

14:40.921 --> 14:42.006
Okay.

14:43.507 --> 14:46.760
Good, good. Good, good, good, good.
You did a good job, Sergeant.

14:46.844 --> 14:49.180
You ever had a gun
stuck in your face before?

14:49.263 --> 14:50.347
- Yeah, once.
- Really?

14:50.431 --> 14:52.183
Yeah, by a 12-year-old.

14:52.266 --> 14:55.686
- What was that like?
- Not one of my better days.

14:55.769 --> 14:57.855
I bet. All right, well, look.

14:57.938 --> 15:00.608
As soon as we get this thing cleared up,
we'll cut you loose, all right?

15:00.691 --> 15:02.610
If you don't mind,
I'd rather hang around a while,

15:02.693 --> 15:04.445
at least until we make contact.

15:04.528 --> 15:06.697
That's what I like to hear, Sergeant.

15:25.007 --> 15:28.469
What? Come on. Why you doing this?
Why you doing this to me?

15:29.720 --> 15:32.389
Pop, what's going on? Yo.

15:36.352 --> 15:39.438
All bank employees,
raise your hands!

15:40.481 --> 15:44.568
Bank employees, this side!
Everyone else, over there!

15:50.866 --> 15:55.412
Now, I need everybody
to take your cell phones and your keys

15:55.496 --> 15:59.124
out of your pockets and handbags
and hold them in the air.

16:19.895 --> 16:21.772
- What's your name?
- Peter.

16:21.856 --> 16:24.358
- Peter what?
- Peter Hammond.

16:24.441 --> 16:27.903
- Where's your cell phone, Peter Hammond?
- I left it at home.

16:29.822 --> 16:33.659
Peter, think very carefully
about how you answer the next question

16:33.742 --> 16:36.954
because if you get it wrong,
your headstone will read,

16:37.496 --> 16:40.166
"Here lies Peter Hammond, hero,

16:40.624 --> 16:43.586
"who valiantly attempted
to prevent a brilliant bank robbery

16:43.669 --> 16:46.505
"by trying to hide his cellular phone,

16:46.589 --> 16:50.176
"but wound up getting shot
in the fucking head. "

16:51.552 --> 16:54.388
Now, Peter Hammond,

16:55.472 --> 16:56.807
where is your cell phone?

16:56.891 --> 16:59.476
I'm telling you, I did. I left it at home.

17:54.573 --> 17:57.034
Okay, I fucked up. I'm sorry. Please.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.078
Hey. Don't worry about it.

18:19.515 --> 18:22.685
Just let me talk to you!
Please, please, listen to me.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.270
Let me explain.

18:26.230 --> 18:27.940
Help! Help me.

18:28.440 --> 18:29.525
Stop!

18:30.401 --> 18:31.527
Stop!

18:49.837 --> 18:52.631
Anyone else here smarter than me?

18:59.305 --> 19:01.974
- And you are?
- Vikram Walia.

19:02.057 --> 19:04.768
Vikram Walia. Thanks, Vikram.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.145
Hey, mister.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.484
Keep it.

19:12.568 --> 19:15.154
Men here. Women here.

19:16.488 --> 19:17.615
Move!

19:23.662 --> 19:26.832
I need all of you
to strip down to your underwear.

19:28.751 --> 19:29.835
Now.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.192
Lady?

19:54.068 --> 19:58.864
Believe me. This is the only situation
where I'd ask you to do this.

20:00.032 --> 20:03.536
- But take off your fucking clothes.
- No.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.872
You should be ashamed of yourself.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.376
<i>What's with you mishegoyim?</i>

20:10.459 --> 20:12.711
Go ahead. Make my day.

20:12.795 --> 20:15.381
- Take your fucking clothes off, lady.
- No!

20:17.132 --> 20:18.342
Stevie?

20:21.887 --> 20:23.180
Let's go!

20:24.849 --> 20:27.184
Now, I need all of you

20:27.268 --> 20:30.187
to put on one of these suits
and these masks.

20:40.447 --> 20:43.409
<i>I'm Shon Gables, with CBS 2 News,
outside Manhattan Trust Bank,</i>

20:43.492 --> 20:45.995
<i>where we have just been told
by investigators,</i>

20:46.078 --> 20:47.746
<i>the bank has been robbed.</i>

20:47.830 --> 20:51.083
<i>The suspect or possible suspects are inside,</i>

20:51.167 --> 20:53.002
<i>holed up with an unknown number
of hostages.</i>

20:53.085 --> 20:54.712
- Captain Darius?
- Yeah.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.755
I'm Detective Frazier.
This is Detective Mitchell.

20:56.839 --> 20:57.923
Hey.

20:58.007 --> 21:00.342
You may remember,
we worked that hospital thing on 93rd,

21:00.426 --> 21:02.052
during my training?

21:02.136 --> 21:04.597
Oh, yeah. That was a real shame.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.849
Yeah, it was. It was.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.184
So, what do we got?

21:08.267 --> 21:11.937
I got an unknown number of suspects
and an unknown number of hostages,

21:12.021 --> 21:15.566
and a bank, and about a million spectators,
and I can't see shit inside there,

21:15.649 --> 21:17.359
- so I'm kind of busy.
- I understand.

21:17.443 --> 21:20.112
The way this works, Mr Frazier,
is I deal with Mr Grossman.

21:20.196 --> 21:22.489
So if you need anything,
you can speak with him, okay?

21:22.573 --> 21:24.575
No, it's not okay, Captain.

21:24.658 --> 21:27.161
Detective Grossman is away on vacation,

21:27.244 --> 21:30.122
so Detective Frazier
is the big dick today, all right?

21:30.206 --> 21:33.792
Now, if you need anything,
you can speak to me, all right?

21:33.876 --> 21:35.252
I guess it'll have to be.

21:35.336 --> 21:37.630
That's the way it's gonna be.
You got vests for us?

21:37.713 --> 21:38.964
- Berk!
Yo!

21:39.048 --> 21:40.966
- Get these guys some vests!
- Okay.

21:41.050 --> 21:42.927
- And check them into the command log.
- Okay.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.678
You know what?
I'm gonna get out of your hair

21:44.762 --> 21:46.639
and let you get control
of this crime scene, okay?

21:46.722 --> 21:48.974
You'll let me know when you're ready
with a detailed briefing?

21:49.058 --> 21:51.977
- Okay.
- We're gonna take a walk down to the diner.

21:52.269 --> 21:55.022
Don't go in the bank without calling us first,
all right? Okay?

21:55.105 --> 21:57.691
- All right.
- Good to see you, Captain.

22:06.075 --> 22:07.827
Shouldn't we be in there?

22:08.494 --> 22:11.539
Let's give him some time. See what he does.
Come on.

22:12.498 --> 22:15.000
Until he secures his position
and gets the physical layout,

22:15.084 --> 22:16.293
he'll only dump on us.

22:16.377 --> 22:18.754
If the show starts, he'll call us.
Trust me. I've seen him work.

22:18.838 --> 22:19.964
Your call, Keith.

22:20.047 --> 22:22.341
Can you get that for me?
I guess it is, isn't it?

22:22.424 --> 22:24.218
That's the one thing I learnt
from Grossman,

22:24.301 --> 22:26.554
is these guys don't have much respect
for what we do.

22:26.637 --> 22:29.014
- How do you mean?
- Well, to them it's a tactical situation.

22:29.098 --> 22:33.227
Us being here means there's
a mental side to it that they don't get.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.604
- Told you, you could handle this.
- Yeah.

22:35.688 --> 22:39.066
I keep waiting for someone higher up
on the food chain to show up and say,

22:39.149 --> 22:40.276
"Here's what we do. "

22:40.359 --> 22:41.694
What happened at the hospital?

22:41.777 --> 22:44.655
Guy shot himself, shot his girlfriend.
Thank you.

22:54.456 --> 22:56.250
I told you, I've got

22:58.586 --> 23:01.005
a heart condition.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.381
Get up.

23:28.324 --> 23:29.867
Put down
your fucking weapons!

23:29.950 --> 23:32.244
- Don't move! Don't move!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

23:32.328 --> 23:34.455
- Don't move! Don't move! Come here!
- I haven't got...

23:34.538 --> 23:38.000
- Come here, come here, come here!
- I work in the bank!

23:38.083 --> 23:39.919
On your knees! Down on your knees now!

23:40.002 --> 23:43.422
- They sent me out here!
- Now!

23:43.506 --> 23:45.216
- He said stay away!
- Cuff him.

23:45.299 --> 23:47.760
If you come near the bank,
he'll throw out two dead bodies!

23:47.843 --> 23:49.762
- Who said this? Who?
- I don't know who!

23:49.845 --> 23:51.263
The guy with the big fucking gun!

23:51.347 --> 23:53.057
- That's who!
- All right, get on your feet. Let's go.

23:53.140 --> 23:54.600
- There's four of them in there!
- Come on.

23:54.683 --> 23:55.851
Christ!

23:55.935 --> 23:57.186
- Calm down!
- Let's go!

23:57.269 --> 24:00.648
- Am I gonna be on TV?
- Yeah. A big star. Let's go. Come on.

24:03.567 --> 24:06.987
Was it a time when I thought
I might not see my family again? Yeah.

24:07.071 --> 24:09.740
Yeah, I thought about it.
I mean, at first, I wasn't...

24:09.824 --> 24:12.243
It was too much to think about at that point.

24:12.326 --> 24:15.329
You know, with a gun in your face,
but after a while I...

24:15.412 --> 24:17.581
You know, I thought about...

24:19.583 --> 24:20.751
Yeah.

24:20.835 --> 24:23.671
My wife, you know,
not seeing my wife again.

24:23.754 --> 24:28.133
My kids. I got a 10-year-old son,
17-year-old daughter.

24:29.718 --> 24:32.888
Yeah, I thought about it, man.
What do you think?

24:33.639 --> 24:35.391
Those are my babies.

25:30.571 --> 25:31.906
Beautiful.

25:48.797 --> 25:50.090
Go ahead.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.468
Miss White, I want you to rest assured

25:52.551 --> 25:55.387
my only intention is to spend time
in your wonderful city

25:55.471 --> 25:57.264
and to enjoy all that it has to offer.

25:57.348 --> 25:58.724
And no business with your uncle?

25:58.807 --> 26:01.101
In truth, I have very little
to do with him these days.

26:01.185 --> 26:03.646
I'm told you haven't seen him in nine years.
Is that right?

26:03.729 --> 26:07.274
- You are extremely well informed.
- I have to be. Yes?

26:07.358 --> 26:10.319
I have a Mr Arthur Case
on the phone for you.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.280
We'll need to end this here.

26:13.364 --> 26:15.407
I'm gonna need
a copy of your purchase agreement,

26:15.491 --> 26:17.576
your mortgage application,
and the other documentation,

26:17.660 --> 26:19.829
- and I'll be in touch.
- Thank you, Miss White.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.664
Right this way, sir.

26:32.675 --> 26:34.552
Arthur Case? You sure?

26:34.635 --> 26:36.679
<i>- That's what he said.
- He said his name, just like that?</i>

26:36.762 --> 26:39.098
It wasn't his secretary
saying he was on the line?

26:39.181 --> 26:41.141
<i>- No, ma'am.
- All right. Put him through.</i>

26:41.225 --> 26:42.309
<i>Okay.</i>

26:45.729 --> 26:48.607
<i>- This is Madeleine White.
- Miss White, I'm Arthur Case.</i>

26:48.691 --> 26:50.150
Oh, good morning, Mr Case.

26:50.234 --> 26:54.113
<i>- Have we met formally?
- No, sir, I don't believe we have.</i>

26:54.822 --> 26:57.449
Yet, you're always turning up

26:57.533 --> 26:59.869
at my July 4th parties in Southampton.

27:01.579 --> 27:04.623
Yes, we know some of the same people.

27:04.707 --> 27:06.000
It seems.

27:06.083 --> 27:08.294
I'll come right to the point.

27:09.003 --> 27:11.672
I have a small problem
which requires someone

27:11.755 --> 27:15.050
with very special skills
and complete discretion.

27:15.801 --> 27:18.971
Are you such a person
or have I been misinformed?

27:19.680 --> 27:20.848
<i>Go on.</i>

27:21.599 --> 27:24.560
Can I pick you up in front of
your office building in five minutes?

27:24.643 --> 27:26.937
- I'll be downstairs.
- Thank you.

27:32.526 --> 27:35.988
They had a kind of genius plan

27:36.071 --> 27:38.574
for throwing us out of whack

27:38.657 --> 27:43.037
and depriving us
of any kind of way of controlling ourselves.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.206
They were... They were very

27:47.708 --> 27:50.794
insistent, and yet, strangely detached.

27:50.878 --> 27:54.757
All I know is that they called each other
a variation of Steve.

27:55.299 --> 27:57.927
Steven, Steve-O, Stevie.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.220
And they called you what?

27:59.303 --> 28:01.305
They didn't call me anything.
They just told me...

28:01.388 --> 28:04.475
You're lying to me. Tell me the truth, now.
You're lying to me.

28:04.558 --> 28:06.393
Tell me the...
Look at me and tell me the truth.

28:06.477 --> 28:09.104
They had AK-47 s out. Four of them.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.940
- You know a lot about guns.
- No.

28:11.023 --> 28:13.984
- I don't know anything about guns, except...
- But you know they had an AK-47.

28:14.068 --> 28:17.112
- Everybody knows what an AK-47 is.
- Everybody?

28:17.196 --> 28:21.116
Anybody who's ever watched
a decent action movie would.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.828
- You ever rob a bank before?
- Are you kidding?

28:23.911 --> 28:26.580
Me rob a bank? No.

28:26.789 --> 28:28.833
- Never stole a dollar?
- Never.

28:28.916 --> 28:31.210
- Never?
- Not ever.

28:31.293 --> 28:34.380
- You know what?
- That one time. That one time, that one time.

28:34.463 --> 28:37.925
I stole a nickel
from my grandmother's pocketbook once.

28:39.593 --> 28:41.095
She was Polish.

28:41.762 --> 28:46.016
<i>I used to go up to her and say,
"Mama, toh nicklah, toh nicklah. "</i>

28:47.643 --> 28:52.147
One day, I opened her pocketbook
and there was a nickel.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.607
I took it.

28:53.899 --> 28:56.110
That was the only thing I ever took.

28:59.947 --> 29:02.783
Look, Detective, I didn't mean
to give you a hard time back there.

29:02.867 --> 29:05.035
Forget about it. What's the story, Captain?

29:05.119 --> 29:08.873
Well, the hostage they let go
was Herman Gluck, 73.

29:08.956 --> 29:11.333
He was having chest pains.
Paramedics have him.

29:11.417 --> 29:14.962
They told him to say
that if any cops came near the door,

29:15.045 --> 29:17.339
they'd throw out two dead bodies.

29:17.423 --> 29:21.302
He thinks there's four perps.
Says they came in dressed as painters.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.722
There's a video system in the bank.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.724
We're working on getting a download

29:26.807 --> 29:30.186
from Manhattan Trust's
central security office, but it'll take a while.

29:30.269 --> 29:33.647
We got the block locked up.
I got men in the windows.

29:33.731 --> 29:36.442
We're checking on the sewers with D.E.P.

29:36.525 --> 29:37.818
What about the phones?

29:37.902 --> 29:41.822
Cut and diverted into M.C.C.
We're the only ones they're gonna call.

29:42.072 --> 29:46.619
Cell phones are monitored
and we can jam the air whenever you say.

29:46.702 --> 29:49.914
But we like to leave it clear
in case a hostage is able to get through,

29:49.997 --> 29:52.166
but so far nothing.

29:52.666 --> 29:55.169
- 911?
- It's up on the screen.

29:55.252 --> 29:58.297
Any call about a bank
gets routed straight to us.

29:58.506 --> 30:02.176
Well, that's my end of it, Detective.

30:03.344 --> 30:04.428
Yeah.

30:05.554 --> 30:07.431
Yeah, I'm not calling them yet.

30:07.515 --> 30:09.099
Beg your pardon?

30:09.850 --> 30:11.477
Doesn't feel right yet,
you know what I mean?

30:11.560 --> 30:13.437
I'm not gonna call him
and ask what I can do for him.

30:13.521 --> 30:15.272
Let's see what he does.

30:16.440 --> 30:17.775
Your call.

30:25.866 --> 30:28.494
Now, Mr Case, why don't you
let me explain to you how I work?

30:28.577 --> 30:30.538
Please. That would be nice.

30:30.871 --> 30:35.584
Well, you say that there are family heirlooms
inside your safety deposit box.

30:35.668 --> 30:37.044
That's fine.

30:37.127 --> 30:40.840
But in my experience, people like you
have people working for them

30:40.923 --> 30:42.383
that handle these kinds of things.

30:42.466 --> 30:45.386
And when they can't,
well, they don't call me.

30:45.469 --> 30:47.263
Their people call me.

30:47.513 --> 30:50.558
So, immediately, I know
that there's something in that box

30:50.641 --> 30:53.978
that you don't even want
your closest aides to know about.

30:54.728 --> 30:56.397
No problem with me.

30:56.480 --> 31:00.609
You tell me I don't need to know
what's in that box and I don't need to know.

31:00.693 --> 31:03.571
But if you tell me
that it's a bunch of old baseball cards

31:03.654 --> 31:07.616
and I find out that it's the launch codes
for a nuclear missile,

31:08.159 --> 31:11.412
then let's just say
we no longer have an agreement.

31:11.495 --> 31:13.455
- Have you finished?
- Yes.

31:13.706 --> 31:15.791
What's inside that box, young lady,

31:15.875 --> 31:18.586
has belonged to me
since before you were born.

31:18.752 --> 31:22.882
It's very valuable
and poses no danger whatsoever to anyone.

31:23.424 --> 31:24.758
Except you.

31:26.594 --> 31:29.430
Okay. Well, first,
there are men with guns in there,

31:29.513 --> 31:31.307
so I can't guarantee any results. Agreed?

31:31.390 --> 31:33.100
- Of course.
- All right.

31:33.184 --> 31:36.103
Now, what makes you think
that they want to rob your box?

31:36.187 --> 31:37.438
I don't.

31:38.606 --> 31:42.234
Well, why don't you tell me
how you would like this to end?

31:43.903 --> 31:48.824
I'd prefer that nobody
ever touch my safe deposit box.

31:49.116 --> 31:51.911
Not them, not you, not the authorities.

31:51.994 --> 31:54.830
And the sooner this situation ends,
the happier I'll be.

31:54.914 --> 31:57.625
- Is that specific enough for you?
- No.

32:00.211 --> 32:02.171
The contents of that box

32:04.465 --> 32:06.467
are of great value to me.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.887
So long as they remain my secret.

32:09.970 --> 32:11.847
And if they're exposed?

32:20.814 --> 32:22.816
I'll face some difficult questions.

32:22.983 --> 32:26.237
- So, it stays locked or it disappears.
- Precisely.

32:26.320 --> 32:28.614
- Can you make that happen?
- Yes.

32:28.697 --> 32:32.034
I hope so.
I have to say, I can't help but be sceptical.

32:32.117 --> 32:35.037
Whoever gave you my number
got the same deal.

32:35.204 --> 32:37.915
Clearly, they must have been satisfied.

32:45.798 --> 32:46.966
Steve?

32:47.341 --> 32:49.176
It's time for Steve-O.

32:56.016 --> 32:59.019
I came out here to take a look
at the perimeter they laid down.

32:59.103 --> 33:00.479
Guess what I found?

33:00.563 --> 33:03.983
That hostage they let out said these guys
came in dressed like painters, right?

33:04.066 --> 33:05.150
Yeah.

33:15.452 --> 33:17.037
Probably stolen.

33:17.121 --> 33:19.665
Have them run it and check it for prints.

33:24.044 --> 33:27.047
- Everybody on?
- Yep, I'm there.

33:38.267 --> 33:41.187
- Sure you got the right number?
- Absolutely.

33:51.572 --> 33:53.240
Okay. Nothing yet.

33:55.993 --> 33:57.244
We got video.

33:57.328 --> 33:58.704
Let's have it.

34:01.499 --> 34:03.459
What happened to that camera
right there?

34:03.542 --> 34:05.878
Wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

34:09.797 --> 34:11.382
Yeah, there it is.
That guy right there.

34:11.467 --> 34:14.762
It's like he blinds the camera
with the flashlight.

34:14.844 --> 34:17.389
It's weird, isn't it?
It's like nobody else sees it.

34:17.473 --> 34:20.266
- You'd think it'd be pretty bright, huh?
- It could be infrared.

34:20.351 --> 34:22.478
- What's that?
- Infrared bulb.

34:22.937 --> 34:25.563
See, humans can't see it,
but a video camera will pick it up.

34:25.648 --> 34:27.650
He could knock out the cameras
without no one knowing.

34:27.733 --> 34:28.943
Right, right, right, right.

34:29.025 --> 34:30.820
He knocked out
the cameras about 10:00.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.030
So, for approximately two minutes,

34:33.112 --> 34:36.826
we got no evidence of people
leaving or entering the bank. That's great.

34:36.909 --> 34:39.954
Miriam, how long were you there
before it began?

34:40.036 --> 34:41.539
It was just a few minutes.

34:41.621 --> 34:44.792
Well, can you tell us what happened
after the explosions and the smoke?

34:44.875 --> 34:49.170
They just told us to put our heads down.
And then close our eyes.

34:49.255 --> 34:52.257
And then I just remember one of them

34:52.341 --> 34:55.094
telling the others to just go down
and fix the cameras.

34:55.177 --> 34:57.054
<i>- The video cameras?
- I don't know.</i>

34:57.137 --> 34:59.098
Anything else you want to share with us?

34:59.181 --> 35:00.307
No, just...

35:00.391 --> 35:02.184
- You sure?
- Yeah, I...

35:02.309 --> 35:05.354
Could you give us
the names of the bank robbers, maybe?

35:05.437 --> 35:07.398
I'm just messing with you, sweetheart.

35:07.481 --> 35:08.858
- You okay?
- Thank you.

35:08.941 --> 35:10.025
Okay.

35:10.192 --> 35:12.111
- It was pretty awful.
- Was it bad?

35:12.194 --> 35:14.363
I mean, they made us strip.

35:14.947 --> 35:17.408
They made us take off our clothes.

35:19.076 --> 35:21.871
I don't understand why they had to do that.

35:21.954 --> 35:23.455
I really just thought...

35:23.539 --> 35:25.875
I thought I was gonna be killed.

35:26.625 --> 35:27.710
Well.

35:29.795 --> 35:31.881
- All right, my dear.
- Okay.

35:32.673 --> 35:34.383
- I can go?
- No.

35:34.466 --> 35:36.177
- No?
- No, you got to stay.

35:36.260 --> 35:37.720
- You got to stay.
- No, you can go.

35:37.803 --> 35:40.014
No, stay. No, go.

35:40.097 --> 35:41.640
Did you rob the bank?

35:41.724 --> 35:42.975
- You did.
- Did you rob the bank?

35:43.058 --> 35:44.310
- No.
- You sure?

35:44.602 --> 35:47.354
There's movement at the front door.
- Let's go.

35:50.733 --> 35:53.736
Put down the fucking weapon!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

35:53.819 --> 35:55.696
Don't move! Don't move!

35:55.779 --> 35:57.072
He's got a device on him there.

35:57.156 --> 36:00.409
I said put your hands on your head
and get down on your fucking knees!

36:00.493 --> 36:03.245
I said put your hands on your head
and down on your knees now!

36:03.329 --> 36:04.747
Hands are tied!
Hands are tied.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.957
- Jesus, pat him down.
- All right.

36:07.041 --> 36:08.918
I'm one of the hostages!
- Careful.

36:09.001 --> 36:10.377
Easy, be very careful,
now. Easy.

36:10.461 --> 36:11.879
I can't see him from where I'm at.

36:11.962 --> 36:14.840
I can see him. I got a clear shot.
Any weapons?

36:15.090 --> 36:17.343
- Who are you?
- Vikram Walia. I work in the bank.

36:17.426 --> 36:19.595
Okay. Vikram? Is this a bomb?

36:19.678 --> 36:21.805
- Oh, shit! A fucking Arab!
- What? No. I'm a Sikh!

36:21.889 --> 36:23.057
- Is that a bomb?
- No.

36:23.140 --> 36:24.266
- Answer me, Vikram. Is this a bomb?
- No.

36:24.350 --> 36:25.768
- Are you booby-trapped?
- No, fuck, no.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.478
Okay, Vikram, I need you to relax.

36:27.561 --> 36:30.189
- Jesus, give me a hand.
- I don't know.

36:30.272 --> 36:32.316
Just watch.
There's a lot of movement in that bank.

36:32.399 --> 36:33.859
- Team, take him down.
- Mike, now, get him.

36:33.943 --> 36:35.361
What the fuck? Easy, easy.

36:35.444 --> 36:38.197
Get off my... That's my turban. Get off. Easy.

36:38.864 --> 36:41.700
Get... My turban!
Look, fuck, give my turban back!

36:41.784 --> 36:43.118
Come on, shut up. Relax.

36:43.202 --> 36:45.079
What the fuck are you doing?
Give me my turban back.

36:45.162 --> 36:46.831
- You can't fucking rip my turban.
- Shut up, already.

36:46.914 --> 36:48.082
- What the fuck?
- Come on, move it.

36:48.165 --> 36:50.167
Get your fucking hands off me!

36:54.588 --> 36:56.215
And the 11:00 and 12:00...

36:56.298 --> 36:59.426
And don't forget about your 1:00
with Chancellor Joel Klein.

36:59.510 --> 37:01.846
- Oh, Madge. What a day...
- Your Honour.

37:01.929 --> 37:03.639
Madeleine! How are you?

37:03.722 --> 37:06.308
I'm just fine, but thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

37:06.392 --> 37:09.645
- Sure. Madge, are we through here?
- Yes, Mr Mayor.

37:09.895 --> 37:11.689
This way, Miss White.

37:12.314 --> 37:16.652
I always have time to put on a tux
and eat free food for a good cause.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.571
Who are we saving this week?

37:18.654 --> 37:20.406
Well, I'm doing a round of support

37:20.489 --> 37:23.409
for the Joseph Freidkin Memorial Fund
for Spinal Cord Research

37:23.492 --> 37:25.536
and we're having
our annual fundraiser next month.

37:25.619 --> 37:27.580
If you could attend,
it would give us such a boost.

37:27.663 --> 37:31.584
It would be my pleasure.
Is there anything else I can do to...

37:32.334 --> 37:34.670
- What the fuck do you want?
- A favour.

37:34.753 --> 37:38.591
- No shit. Which kind?
- The last one I'll ever ask of you.

37:39.091 --> 37:41.343
That's the kind I had in mind.

37:41.510 --> 37:43.971
You know about this hostage situation.

37:44.054 --> 37:46.265
On my way. What's it to do with you?

37:46.348 --> 37:48.475
All right, well, I need to keep an eye on it.

37:48.559 --> 37:51.562
So, I want you to bring me down there
and tell whoever's in charge

37:51.645 --> 37:53.647
to extend me every courtesy.

37:56.525 --> 37:58.861
You're out of your fucking mind.

37:59.403 --> 38:02.239
If it was easy,
it wouldn't square us, would it?

38:02.406 --> 38:05.576
- It's impossible.
- Nothing's impossible.

38:05.659 --> 38:07.828
You just have to call in a few markers,
that's all.

38:07.912 --> 38:10.080
I may have to give out a few.

38:10.706 --> 38:13.209
Then that's exactly what you'll do.

38:14.585 --> 38:16.629
You're a magnificent cunt.

38:20.007 --> 38:21.342
Thank you.

38:25.179 --> 38:28.390
<i>It's been a very tense situation
for several hours now.</i>

38:28.474 --> 38:30.809
<i>It's unclear how many hostages are inside</i>

38:30.893 --> 38:33.312
<i>and how many robbers
police are dealing with.</i>

38:33.395 --> 38:36.649
<i>Officials say this all started out
as a robbery at Manhattan Trust,</i>

38:36.732 --> 38:39.610
<i>but has turned into this hostage situation.</i>

38:39.693 --> 38:42.488
<i>Negotiators are here on the scene,
working very hard</i>

38:42.571 --> 38:45.241
<i>and it's still unclear
on any possible injuries.</i>

38:45.324 --> 38:47.576
<i>Of course, we'll keep you up to date
with the very latest</i>

38:47.660 --> 38:50.579
<i>and we will remain here on the scene
as this all unfolds.</i>

38:50.663 --> 38:52.581
<i>That's the latest from here
in lower Manhattan.</i>

38:52.665 --> 38:55.417
<i>Reporting live, I'm Sandra Endo.
Back to you.</i>

38:55.501 --> 38:58.420
"Protect and serve" my ass.
Where's my turban?

38:58.921 --> 39:00.923
I'm not talking to anybody without a turban.

39:01.006 --> 39:04.093
It's part of my religion, to cover my head
in respect to God. I'm a Sikh.

39:04.176 --> 39:05.469
Okay, we'll find your turban.

39:05.553 --> 39:07.847
Not an Arab, by the way,
like your cops called me outside.

39:07.930 --> 39:09.932
Now, no, I don't think you heard that.

39:10.015 --> 39:12.351
There was a lot going on.
You were probably disoriented.

39:12.434 --> 39:14.395
- I didn't hear that.
- I heard what I heard.

39:14.478 --> 39:16.564
I'll give you all the information you want.

39:16.647 --> 39:19.525
I don't need this. I need my turban.
It's part of my religion.

39:19.608 --> 39:21.652
- We'll get you your turban.
- We'll find it for you.

39:21.735 --> 39:24.155
No, no, no. Not "get me. "
I want my turban now.

39:24.238 --> 39:26.949
You just got to start thinking
about the people inside the bank now.

39:27.032 --> 39:28.117
It's a dangerous situation.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.619
You got to start telling us
about what's going on inside the bank.

39:30.703 --> 39:33.122
We can talk about this later.
We'll get an officer to come down.

39:33.205 --> 39:34.665
You can write a formal complaint.

39:34.748 --> 39:37.126
But for now,
we got to deal with this situation.

39:37.209 --> 39:39.253
First you beat me,
and now you want my help.

39:39.336 --> 39:41.964
You need to start thinking
about your coworkers.

39:42.047 --> 39:45.634
I could apologise on behalf of the NYPD,
but that was not us. We are detectives.

39:45.718 --> 39:47.761
- We're gonna try and find out...
- What do you want to know?

39:47.845 --> 39:50.472
- How many were there?
- I think there were about four.

39:50.556 --> 39:54.310
- How many hostages?
- I don't know how many hostages, 20, 30.

39:55.728 --> 39:59.690
I'm fucking tired of this shit.
What happened to my fucking civil rights?

39:59.773 --> 40:02.651
Why can't I go anywhere
without being harassed?

40:02.735 --> 40:04.945
I get thrown out of a bank.
I'm a hostage. I get harassed.

40:05.029 --> 40:06.155
I go to the airport.

40:06.238 --> 40:08.991
I can't go through security
without a "random" selection.

40:09.074 --> 40:10.910
Fucking random, my ass.
I nearly lost my job...

40:10.993 --> 40:13.329
I bet you can get a cab, though.

40:14.246 --> 40:16.290
I guess that's one of the perks.

40:16.874 --> 40:18.876
Put the ice on your face.

40:23.255 --> 40:26.634
<i>"Two buses with full gas tanks.
One jumbo jet with full gas tank</i>

40:26.717 --> 40:29.345
<i>"and pilots at JFK,
parked at the end of runway. "</i>

40:29.428 --> 40:31.096
<i>They give us until 9:00 pm to do this,</i>

40:31.180 --> 40:33.641
<i>then they kill one hostage every hour
in front of TV cameras.</i>

40:33.724 --> 40:37.186
"Bank is secured with Semtex.
We will demonstrate if necessary. "

40:37.269 --> 40:41.148
- Whatever you do, don't give them a jet.
- There's no plane. Maybe a bus. Maybe.

40:41.232 --> 40:43.859
Till I talk to them, they get nothing.
Not even a cup of coffee.

40:43.943 --> 40:45.069
For now, we wait.

40:45.152 --> 40:47.571
Let's let them wonder
what we're doing, okay?

40:47.655 --> 40:49.907
Excuse me, Detectives. This is Arthur Case.

40:49.990 --> 40:52.576
- He's the...
- I'm Chairman, Board of Directors.

40:52.660 --> 40:55.746
- Of the bank. You wanna talk to him?
- Absolutely.

40:55.830 --> 40:58.499
Mr Case, how are you?
I'm Detective Frazier.

40:58.582 --> 41:00.960
Anything in particular
you think we should know?

41:01.043 --> 41:05.047
No. I just wondered
if I might be of some assistance.

41:07.174 --> 41:10.177
- Have they made any demands?
- They want a jet.

41:11.136 --> 41:12.471
Oh, I see.

41:14.723 --> 41:17.518
Would you like me to arrange one for you?

41:24.066 --> 41:26.402
I'm so sorry. I must have misunderstood.

41:26.485 --> 41:28.904
That's quite all right, Mr Case.

41:29.572 --> 41:31.365
Where can we reach you
if we need anything?

41:31.448 --> 41:33.284
Well, those are my people in there,
you know,

41:33.367 --> 41:36.245
and I would like to stay here for a while.
And I won't disturb you.

41:36.328 --> 41:38.372
I'll be very quiet right down...
Sergeant Collins!

41:38.455 --> 41:41.667
Mr Case, we'll try and keep you posted
as best we can,

41:41.750 --> 41:43.711
but you're gonna have to excuse us
for now, okay?

41:43.794 --> 41:45.462
Right this way, sir.
Thank you very much.

41:45.546 --> 41:46.714
- Absolutely.
- This way, sir.

41:46.797 --> 41:49.425
Thank you very much.
- And thank you all so much.

41:49.508 --> 41:50.968
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

41:51.051 --> 41:52.553
This way, sir.

42:26.712 --> 42:29.298
"Fifty hungry people need food now. "

42:39.725 --> 42:41.894
All right.
Are we ready with the listening devices?

42:41.977 --> 42:44.188
I'm gonna need 15 minutes
once we get the food.

42:44.271 --> 42:46.232
Pizza's the best. No sandwiches.

42:46.315 --> 42:48.275
Is she for real?
Are you for real?

42:48.359 --> 42:51.654
Well, if we send in, say,
10 pizzas boxes with transmitters,

42:51.737 --> 42:54.490
maybe we'll get some conversation
if we give them something to group around.

42:54.573 --> 42:56.534
Give them each a sandwich, it's hit or miss.

42:56.617 --> 42:59.286
They can move around
and I don't have 50 transmitters.

42:59.370 --> 43:01.497
- What's this?
- It's a digital recorder.

43:01.580 --> 43:03.666
You click it, and it'll record for half an hour.

43:03.749 --> 43:06.168
- James Bond shit.
- Well, you can get them on Amazon.

43:06.252 --> 43:08.754
- You gonna ask for a hostage?
- He already gave us one, didn't he?

43:08.838 --> 43:10.923
I ask for another one,
he says no, then what?

43:11.006 --> 43:12.842
No, he knows what he's doing.

43:12.925 --> 43:14.844
He gave us a hostage.
We'll give him some food.

43:14.927 --> 43:17.638
I don't want to get caught bluffing this guy.

43:22.726 --> 43:26.605
Fuck this shit. Look, they want to shoot me
for taking off my mask, they can go ahead.

43:26.689 --> 43:28.274
Do you wanna get us all killed?

43:28.357 --> 43:30.484
You wanna relax?
What the hell is the difference?

43:30.568 --> 43:33.362
They're out there robbing the bank!

43:33.445 --> 43:36.031
- Can't you see they fucked him up?
- Shut up.

43:36.115 --> 43:38.075
<i>You think they dressed us like this for fun,
puñeta?</i>

43:38.159 --> 43:39.493
- I have no idea
- Please shut up.

43:39.577 --> 43:41.787
...why they made us put on all of this crap.

43:41.871 --> 43:44.832
Probably so when the cops break in
and try to rescue us

43:44.915 --> 43:47.084
- we all get fucking shot.
- Oh, my God!

43:47.168 --> 43:49.378
It's a great plan, but, no, thanks.

43:49.712 --> 43:51.839
I told you to shut up! Leave him!

43:53.465 --> 43:56.635
No! Don't do this to me! Please, don't.

44:00.931 --> 44:05.019
I'll do as you say! No! Help! Help!

44:19.825 --> 44:21.619
Please, don't! Don't!

44:29.126 --> 44:31.170
One guy did most of the talking.

44:31.795 --> 44:33.631
He told everyone else what to do.

44:33.714 --> 44:36.425
- So they were talking amongst themselves?
- We couldn't hear them.

44:36.509 --> 44:39.094
They had us in these rooms.

44:39.595 --> 44:41.805
The doors were locked all the time.

44:41.889 --> 44:43.933
We didn't know what they were doing.

44:44.016 --> 44:46.727
- Did you hear anything they said?
- I have problems with my hearing.

44:46.810 --> 44:48.604
- I see.
- I wear hearing aids.

44:48.687 --> 44:50.397
- Where are they?
- They're in my ears.

44:50.481 --> 44:51.649
- Let's see.
- Let me see them.

44:51.732 --> 44:54.318
- Yeah, let's take a look at them.
- Yeah, it's a hearing aid.

44:54.401 --> 44:55.653
That's your other one, there?

44:55.736 --> 44:57.696
What's the red part, there?
What does that do?

44:57.780 --> 45:00.282
They're different colours.
You need two different...

45:00.366 --> 45:02.326
And to distinguish right from left, also.

45:02.409 --> 45:03.828
- Distinguish right from left?
- Yeah.

45:03.911 --> 45:05.412
Right from wrong.

45:05.496 --> 45:06.956
I don't understand.

45:07.039 --> 45:09.416
- Steve?
- I'm sorry?

45:09.500 --> 45:10.876
- I didn't say anything.
- Oh.

45:10.960 --> 45:12.837
Steve. Is that your name? Steve?

45:12.920 --> 45:14.505
Stevie? Steve-O?

45:14.922 --> 45:17.216
- How much are they gonna pay you?
- I'm sorry?

45:17.299 --> 45:19.844
- You heard me.
- No, I didn't.

45:19.927 --> 45:23.764
- How much are they going to pay you?
- Who's gonna pay me?

45:23.848 --> 45:26.851
- Were you involved in this robbery?
- Absolutely not.

45:26.934 --> 45:29.186
Were you involved in this situation?

45:30.271 --> 45:32.648
- What situation?
- Don't lie. Don't lie.

45:51.208 --> 45:53.836
If he gives us a tip, I'm keeping it.

45:54.211 --> 45:55.796
- Put that gun down!
- Check that weapon!

45:55.880 --> 45:57.923
All right, everybody, relax.
Calm down. Calm down.

45:58.007 --> 45:59.717
Calm the fuck down!

46:02.386 --> 46:03.888
How you doing?

46:05.264 --> 46:08.684
I'm Detective Keith Frazier,
Hostage Negotiation Team.

46:09.476 --> 46:10.853
How's it going?

46:11.729 --> 46:15.232
Okay. I hope the pizzas are okay.
They might be a little cold.

46:15.483 --> 46:17.943
Listen, you pick up the phone
anytime you want.

46:18.027 --> 46:19.445
It's a direct line to me.

46:19.528 --> 46:21.405
I would love to talk to you.

46:27.578 --> 46:29.371
Nice talking to you.

46:58.484 --> 47:00.653
Shit. Fucking Russians.

47:00.820 --> 47:04.031
Call Operations. See if they can get
a Russian translator over here ASAP.

47:04.114 --> 47:05.866
And get some fucking body bags.

47:05.950 --> 47:07.743
I hope you know what you're doing.

47:07.827 --> 47:10.663
Because if my guys got to shoot it out
with those fucking savages...

47:10.746 --> 47:12.456
Okay, okay, okay. Mitch?

47:12.873 --> 47:14.583
Check with either one of the hostages.

47:14.667 --> 47:18.879
Find out if they heard any Russian
or Russian accents when they were in there.

47:18.963 --> 47:20.464
We'll be all right.

47:38.649 --> 47:39.733
No!

47:42.486 --> 47:44.113
Down on the floor!

47:51.787 --> 47:54.290
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go. Let's go.

47:55.791 --> 47:57.793
Stop crying! Shut the fuck up!

48:01.172 --> 48:04.967
Get in there! Sit down! Put your masks on!

48:05.718 --> 48:08.053
Come on, let's go. Come on, boobs.

48:08.137 --> 48:11.765
- "Boobs"? Who the fuck you talking to?
- Let's go. You heard me! Shut the fuck up!

48:11.849 --> 48:14.143
- Why?
- Move that fat ass! Let's go! Come on!

48:14.226 --> 48:15.519
"Fat ass"? Are you kidding me?

48:15.603 --> 48:19.523
If you don't shut the fuck up,
I'm gonna put my foot up your fat ass!

48:22.776 --> 48:24.862
Put your masks on!

48:24.945 --> 48:26.906
Put your hands on the ground!

48:26.989 --> 48:28.491
Okay, okay.

48:29.158 --> 48:31.494
On the floor. Hands are on the floor.

48:36.207 --> 48:37.791
Masks on!

48:38.167 --> 48:40.211
Put your hands on the ground!

48:41.754 --> 48:43.130
Come on, boobs, let's go.

48:43.214 --> 48:45.549
Oh, shit. Sit down! Sit down!

48:54.892 --> 48:57.019
She was on line in front of me.

48:57.478 --> 48:59.814
He was the teller on my line.

48:59.897 --> 49:03.734
This guy was to my right
and his kid was in front of him.

49:03.818 --> 49:05.903
He was playing with a video game.

49:05.986 --> 49:07.446
I remember her.

49:07.530 --> 49:09.907
- Why do you remember her?
- Great tits.

49:11.450 --> 49:15.830
- You remember seeing any of them after?
- Yeah, I saw her one time afterwards.

49:15.913 --> 49:19.583
- How are you sure you saw her again?
- I could see under the suit.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.585
Can't hide quality like that.

49:21.669 --> 49:24.171
This guy, he almost got us all killed.

49:24.255 --> 49:25.339
How?

49:25.422 --> 49:27.883
They put eight or nine of us
in an office for a while.

49:27.967 --> 49:32.012
This guy took off his mask
and was talking like he wasn't afraid.

49:32.096 --> 49:34.557
"I don't have to wear this damn mask,"
you know?

49:34.640 --> 49:38.727
So, they come in, pull him out of the room
and smack him around a little.

49:39.812 --> 49:41.981
- You see him again after that?
- No.

49:42.773 --> 49:44.817
- Was he okay?
- Seemed fine.

49:46.026 --> 49:47.236
You...

49:48.028 --> 49:52.241
- You recognise anyone else from that room?
- I can't be sure about the others.

49:52.324 --> 49:53.534
No one?

49:54.201 --> 49:57.037
- Why don't you keep looking?
- You know, I was terrified.

49:57.121 --> 49:58.455
What about before it began?

49:58.539 --> 50:00.875
You didn't look around
while you were waiting in line?

50:00.958 --> 50:03.627
I was talking to my girlfriend on the phone.

50:07.256 --> 50:09.300
You wanna take another picture?

50:09.592 --> 50:11.969
I could bend over and pick up a pencil.

50:12.553 --> 50:13.804
Whatever.

50:14.513 --> 50:15.806
This guy.

50:16.724 --> 50:17.975
Asshole.

50:39.663 --> 50:41.832
What the fuck? This ain't Russian.

50:43.334 --> 50:45.044
No? What the hell is it?

50:45.503 --> 50:47.838
It's not Polish. Not Hungarian.

50:48.172 --> 50:50.341
Bulgarian, maybe.

50:51.091 --> 50:53.344
It's Central European. Sort of.

50:53.427 --> 50:55.846
That's it?
I mean, you're the language expert.

50:55.930 --> 50:57.348
What? No.

50:58.182 --> 51:00.226
- What do you think?
- Well, okay.

51:00.684 --> 51:02.019
Well, this is New York City.

51:02.102 --> 51:03.979
Somebody on the street
must know what it is.

51:04.063 --> 51:05.397
Probably the hot-dog man.

51:05.481 --> 51:08.484
Berk, play that over the speaker for me.
Excuse me.

51:11.946 --> 51:13.239
Excuse me!

51:13.531 --> 51:17.243
Does anybody know
what language they're speaking? Anybody?

51:17.326 --> 51:18.619
Yo, my man.

51:18.702 --> 51:21.247
Hey, Phil, let that guy through. Come on.

51:25.751 --> 51:28.796
- You know what language they're speaking?
- Yeah, they're speaking Albanian.

51:28.879 --> 51:31.173
- Albanian?
- Albanian. From Albania.

51:34.844 --> 51:36.387
What am I doing here?

51:38.764 --> 51:40.558
Yo, am I getting arrested for something?

51:40.641 --> 51:43.561
No, you're not getting arrested.
Come on. Come on.

51:44.311 --> 51:45.437
Whoa.

51:46.021 --> 51:49.567
- Okay. What are they saying?
- I have no idea what they're saying.

51:49.650 --> 51:51.443
You got no idea?
I thought you said you spoke Albanian.

51:51.527 --> 51:52.611
No. I never said I speak Albanian.

51:52.695 --> 51:53.863
You said you spoke Albanian.

51:53.946 --> 51:55.072
I never said I speak Albanian.

51:55.156 --> 51:56.574
Well, how do you know it's Albanian?

51:56.657 --> 51:58.659
My ex-wife and her parents are Albanian.

51:58.742 --> 52:01.203
Her parents couldn't speak English for shit.

52:01.287 --> 52:02.663
I have no idea what they're saying,

52:02.746 --> 52:05.416
but I'll tell you right now
that the language is 100% Albanian.

52:05.499 --> 52:07.001
- 100%?
- 100%.

52:07.084 --> 52:09.920
Call the Albanian Consulate.
See if they can get somebody over here

52:10.004 --> 52:11.797
to translate this for us. Make it happen fast.

52:11.881 --> 52:13.549
Okay, you hang out
in the back for me, okay?

52:13.632 --> 52:15.134
Oh, man, not again.

52:15.885 --> 52:19.388
Van was stolen two days ago, but it's clean.
No prints.

52:19.471 --> 52:20.931
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

52:21.849 --> 52:23.100
Albanian?

52:23.184 --> 52:26.353
My man, like I told you, 100% Albanian.

52:28.647 --> 52:30.024
Undeniable.

52:42.995 --> 52:45.164
- Hey.
- Thanks.

53:10.773 --> 53:13.025
<i>Yo, yo, yo.
There go that motherfucker right there.</i>

53:13.108 --> 53:15.736
<i>Hey, yo, you thought you was gonna
get away with that shit, didn't you?</i>

53:15.820 --> 53:17.321
How does this game work?

53:17.404 --> 53:21.534
You get points for doing dirt,
like jacking a car or selling crack.

53:21.867 --> 53:25.329
And you lose points
if someone jacks your ride or shoots you.

53:25.871 --> 53:27.248
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

53:27.331 --> 53:29.917
<i>Take that! Take this! What? What? What?</i>

53:30.000 --> 53:32.002
<i>Talk shit now! I don't hear you!</i>

53:32.086 --> 53:34.630
<i>Eat this! Eat that! Eat this! Eat that!</i>

53:34.839 --> 53:37.174
<i>You're gone, baby! You're dead! Bye-bye!</i>

53:37.424 --> 53:38.551
Jesus!

53:39.218 --> 53:40.928
What's the point of this?

53:41.011 --> 53:44.473
Like my man 50 says,
"Get rich or die tryin'."

53:45.224 --> 53:48.144
Yo, you'd get mad points
for knocking over the bank.

53:48.227 --> 53:52.231
- You think that's cool?
- Hell, yeah. You trying to get paid, too.

53:56.235 --> 53:59.321
Finish your slice.
I'll take you back to your father.

54:00.739 --> 54:03.075
I got to talk to him about this game.

54:11.083 --> 54:13.294
- Is it good?
- No doubt.

54:16.881 --> 54:18.340
It's gonna be okay.

54:19.383 --> 54:20.467
Cool.

54:21.135 --> 54:22.595
You'll be home soon.

54:23.262 --> 54:24.722
That's whassup.

54:30.102 --> 54:31.270
- Sir?
- Yeah.

54:31.353 --> 54:33.355
- No luck with the Albanian Consulate.
- What do you mean?

54:33.439 --> 54:35.941
I couldn't tell what the guy
was talking about. I think he wanted money.

54:36.025 --> 54:38.068
And I tried the State Department.
That takes a month.

54:38.152 --> 54:39.278
Okay.

54:39.653 --> 54:41.530
- Call her.
- Are you crazy?

54:41.614 --> 54:43.949
- I hate that bitch. Come on.
- You said she speaks Albanian, right?

54:44.033 --> 54:46.285
- Yeah, she was born there.
- Call her.

54:46.368 --> 54:48.037
I'm gonna regret this.

55:28.661 --> 55:30.704
- Who's Detective Frazier?
- Right here.

55:30.788 --> 55:33.374
- I have Ilina Maria over here.
- Miritia.

55:33.457 --> 55:34.917
- Oh, how you doing?
- Hello.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.252
How you doing?

55:36.961 --> 55:39.839
- What's this?
- Parking tickets. You can fix them?

55:41.841 --> 55:44.051
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

55:44.343 --> 55:46.929
Can you listen to this
and tell us what they're saying?

55:47.012 --> 55:48.806
You can't smoke in here.

55:51.851 --> 55:53.227
Shit. Go ahead.

56:03.821 --> 56:06.365
What's so funny?
What, you know what they're talking about?

56:06.448 --> 56:09.535
I know what they're talking about.
I even know who it is.

56:09.618 --> 56:11.704
You know who it is?
You mean you know their names?

56:11.787 --> 56:13.539
- Who? I mean, who is it?
- Parking tickets?

56:13.622 --> 56:16.208
- They're taken care of. Who is it?
- It's Enver Hoxha.

56:16.292 --> 56:18.961
- Who?
- He was the president of Albania.

56:19.378 --> 56:20.546
Wait.

56:20.629 --> 56:23.507
You're telling me the former president
of Albania is in there robbing a bank?

56:23.591 --> 56:24.842
Enver Hoxha's dead.

56:24.925 --> 56:28.095
That's a tape of him discussing
how Albanian people are great people.

56:28.179 --> 56:30.806
They are immortal people. I wouldn't worry.

56:32.516 --> 56:34.560
It's a tape. You're sure about that?

56:34.685 --> 56:36.854
I had to listen to all this nonsense
in school.

56:36.937 --> 56:41.233
"Communism is great. Capitalism is evil.
Lenin, Marx, blah, blah, blah. "

56:41.317 --> 56:43.235
It's Enver Hoxha. It's a tape.

56:43.319 --> 56:47.072
Okay. Okay, well,
Officer, you can take her home.

56:47.156 --> 56:50.659
And do me a favour, huh?
Watch where you park next time, okay?

56:57.666 --> 56:59.210
So, they're playing tapes for us now.

56:59.293 --> 57:00.753
They knew we were gonna bug them.

57:00.836 --> 57:03.506
Yeah, you're damn right they knew we were
gonna bug them. And they knew how.

57:03.589 --> 57:05.549
What makes it even worse,
they wanted us to bug them

57:05.633 --> 57:07.134
so they could send us
on a wild goose chase.

57:07.218 --> 57:10.095
Last time I had my johnson
pulled that good, it cost me $5.

57:10.179 --> 57:11.263
$5?

57:12.348 --> 57:14.058
Yeah, Tijuana. Don't ask.

57:15.935 --> 57:18.062
Look at the... Oh, fuck that.

59:12.259 --> 59:14.803
- Detective Frazier. Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

59:14.887 --> 59:16.138
This is Madeleine White.

59:16.222 --> 59:18.682
- How do you do, Miss White?
- It's an honour, Detective.

59:18.766 --> 59:21.352
Miss White may be able to assist you.

59:21.519 --> 59:24.522
Good. Good. What do you have in mind?

59:24.605 --> 59:28.234
She has a certain amount of influence
in these matters

59:28.317 --> 59:30.945
for reasons which I can't share with you.

59:33.113 --> 59:34.740
What are you trying to say, sir?

59:34.824 --> 59:37.993
What the Mayor means
is that there are matters at stake here

59:38.077 --> 59:40.913
that are a little bit above your pay grade.
No offence.

59:40.996 --> 59:43.040
And he's offering to help you.

59:43.916 --> 59:47.920
Well, why don't you just tell the Mayor
to raise my pay grade to the proper level

59:48.003 --> 59:49.421
and problem solved.

59:49.505 --> 59:51.882
From what I hear, that would have happened
a long time ago

59:51.966 --> 59:55.261
if you'd been a little bit more diplomatic.
But we can certainly discuss it.

59:55.344 --> 59:58.389
Look, I'm kidding. I mean,
I make First Grade when I make First Grade.

59:58.472 --> 01:00:01.267
You want to speed that up,
I'm not gonna talk you out of it.

01:00:01.350 --> 01:00:04.770
Then there's also the matter of $140,000
that seems to have walked away

01:00:04.854 --> 01:00:06.689
from the Madrugada cheque-cashing bust.

01:00:06.772 --> 01:00:07.940
Oh, I see.

01:00:09.567 --> 01:00:11.861
Well, I had nothing to do with that.

01:00:12.653 --> 01:00:14.989
Yeah, Collins, we got snipers
in the windows here.

01:00:15.072 --> 01:00:17.741
We got guys in the building next door.
Guys up on the roof.

01:00:17.825 --> 01:00:19.952
We're trying to get the blueprints
for the bank

01:00:20.035 --> 01:00:23.789
so we can figure out the ventilator shaft.
Maybe we can come down.

01:00:27.126 --> 01:00:29.628
<i>Well?
Is this the President of Albania?</i>

01:00:29.879 --> 01:00:31.714
- Speaking.
- Pretty funny.

01:00:31.964 --> 01:00:34.967
- You shouldn't eavesdrop on people.
- Well, you better get used to it, pal.

01:00:35.050 --> 01:00:37.094
There's not gonna be much privacy
where you're going.

01:00:37.178 --> 01:00:38.304
<i>You're damn right.</i>

01:00:38.387 --> 01:00:41.473
This time next week,
I'll be sucking down piña coladas

01:00:41.557 --> 01:00:44.560
in a hot tub with six girls
named Amber and Tiffany.

01:00:44.643 --> 01:00:47.813
More like taking a shower with two guys
named Jamal and Jesus,

01:00:47.897 --> 01:00:50.483
if you know what I mean.
And here's the bad news,

01:00:50.566 --> 01:00:53.652
that thing you're sucking on,
it's not a piña colada.

01:00:56.071 --> 01:01:00.034
<i>- Maybe you like that kind of thing, huh?
- You really want to piss me off.</i>

01:01:00.117 --> 01:01:01.452
All right, here's where we stand.

01:01:01.535 --> 01:01:04.288
I don't need
your fucking status report, Serpico.

01:01:04.371 --> 01:01:05.956
I tell you where things stand.

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:08.375
<i>- Sure, sure. I just meant...
- Here's where things stand.</i>

01:01:08.459 --> 01:01:10.294
You're getting me what I asked you for.

01:01:10.377 --> 01:01:12.254
You'll have it ready in the time I gave you

01:01:12.338 --> 01:01:15.633
or you'll sit by and you'll watch me do
just what I said I would do. Clear?

01:01:15.716 --> 01:01:17.551
Very clear.
I'm trying to get you what you want.

01:01:17.635 --> 01:01:19.428
But you got to understand this.

01:01:19.512 --> 01:01:23.390
You know, it's not like the City of New York
has 747 s waiting around for days like today.

01:01:23.474 --> 01:01:25.851
I understand that if you don't get
my plane ready,

01:01:25.935 --> 01:01:28.270
<i>- then you might as well send a hearse.
- Please.</i>

01:01:28.354 --> 01:01:30.815
<i>Let's focus on how we can both
get what we want, all right?</i>

01:01:30.898 --> 01:01:33.317
Hey! You're not listening.

01:01:35.152 --> 01:01:38.781
You get me what I want, I won't kill anyone.

01:01:39.323 --> 01:01:41.408
All right. I'm on it. I'm on it.

01:01:42.034 --> 01:01:44.411
Let's just try to keep everybody calm, okay?

01:01:44.495 --> 01:01:47.289
- Don't I sound calm to you?
- Yeah, you do.

01:01:50.292 --> 01:01:51.544
<i>Yeah, you do.</i>

01:02:45.598 --> 01:02:48.434
- So, Mr Damerjian...
- Damerjian.

01:02:48.517 --> 01:02:50.603
- Damerjian. Is that Albanian?
- Just call me Kenneth.

01:02:50.686 --> 01:02:52.938
- Kenneth?
- Is that Albanian or...

01:02:53.022 --> 01:02:54.523
It's Armenian.

01:02:55.274 --> 01:02:56.901
What's the difference?

01:02:57.443 --> 01:02:59.528
Detective, I was born in Queens.

01:03:00.446 --> 01:03:03.657
I've never been to Armenia, Albania.
I went surfing in Australia once.

01:03:03.741 --> 01:03:05.326
Can I have a glass of water?

01:03:05.409 --> 01:03:07.786
- Are you thirsty?
- My throat's parched.

01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:09.455
- I'm not nervous.
- Your throat's parched?

01:03:09.538 --> 01:03:11.290
- My throat's parched.
- His throat is parched.

01:03:11.373 --> 01:03:13.918
- I just want a glass of water.
- Oh, shit!

01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:16.337
When you start telling us
what really happened...

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:18.297
- I just want a glass of water.
- His throat is parched.

01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:20.007
- Here. You want some coffee?
- No, that's all right.

01:03:20.090 --> 01:03:21.342
- I don't drink that stuff.
- No, go ahead.

01:03:21.425 --> 01:03:22.593
Did you know they were robbing the bank?

01:03:22.676 --> 01:03:24.845
I didn't know they were robbing the bank
until they pulled a gun in my face.

01:03:24.929 --> 01:03:26.430
Is that why you held the door open
for them?

01:03:26.514 --> 01:03:27.640
How do you know they robbed the bank?

01:03:27.723 --> 01:03:29.016
Because they pulled a gun in my face...

01:03:29.099 --> 01:03:30.434
That doesn't mean they were
robbing the bank.

01:03:30.518 --> 01:03:32.144
Did they take money?
Did you see them take money?

01:03:32.228 --> 01:03:35.856
I was in a bank and I was locked up
for who knows how long.

01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:38.651
- Okay.
- Tied up in a room. I saw you see me.

01:03:38.734 --> 01:03:40.110
You saw me see you?

01:03:40.194 --> 01:03:41.529
- Is that what you just said?
- Yeah.

01:03:41.612 --> 01:03:43.989
I was locked up in the room.
You saw me gagged when you came in.

01:03:44.073 --> 01:03:46.700
Listen, I can't work miracles over here.
I'm gonna need more time.

01:03:46.784 --> 01:03:49.578
Well, perhaps if you'd use the time
that I gave you more efficiently,

01:03:49.662 --> 01:03:51.163
you wouldn't be having this problem.

01:03:51.247 --> 01:03:54.333
<i>- What do you want me to say?
- That my plane is ready.</i>

01:03:54.667 --> 01:03:56.126
<i>Okay, listen.</i>

01:03:57.336 --> 01:04:01.006
I promise you, as God is my witness,
I'm working on it as hard as I can.

01:04:01.090 --> 01:04:02.842
It's just gonna take a few more hours.

01:04:02.925 --> 01:04:04.426
Why should I give you any more time?

01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:06.846
<i>Well, it's simple. You give me more time,
you get what you want.</i>

01:04:06.929 --> 01:04:09.014
<i>You don't give me the time,
you don't get what you want.</i>

01:04:09.098 --> 01:04:10.641
You got nothing to lose.

01:04:13.435 --> 01:04:15.563
Meanwhile, we'll send in some more food.

01:04:15.646 --> 01:04:18.440
I got a question for you.
You get it right, I give you more time.

01:04:18.524 --> 01:04:21.068
<i>- And?
- You know what happens if you don't.</i>

01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:24.655
Which weighs more?

01:04:25.865 --> 01:04:29.535
All the trains that pass through
Grand Central Station in a year,

01:04:30.244 --> 01:04:33.789
or the trees cut down to print
all US currency in circulation?

01:04:34.373 --> 01:04:36.876
Here's a hint. It's a trick question.

01:04:39.587 --> 01:04:42.089
What the hell is that? Playing games now?

01:04:42.173 --> 01:04:43.340
It's the trains.

01:04:43.424 --> 01:04:46.427
US money isn't printed on paper at all.
It's cotton.

01:04:46.510 --> 01:04:48.137
- Yeah, I heard that.
- Yeah, that's right.

01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:49.555
- Okay.
- So no trees were cut down.

01:04:49.638 --> 01:04:52.099
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. 100%.

01:04:52.308 --> 01:04:53.392
Okay.

01:04:58.439 --> 01:04:59.732
I got it.

01:04:59.815 --> 01:05:02.818
- Wait a second. Wait a second.
- I'll call you back.

01:05:06.739 --> 01:05:08.991
It's a trap. They both weigh the same.

01:05:09.074 --> 01:05:11.494
Tell him they both weigh the same.
They both weigh nothing.

01:05:11.577 --> 01:05:13.579
They both weigh nothing
or they both weigh the same?

01:05:13.662 --> 01:05:14.788
Tell him they both weigh the same.

01:05:14.872 --> 01:05:16.457
Tell him they both weigh the same.
Do it now.

01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:18.709
They both weigh the same. Got it.

01:05:22.338 --> 01:05:25.090
- Well?
- They both weigh the same.

01:05:25.174 --> 01:05:27.134
This time, send sandwiches.

01:05:28.052 --> 01:05:31.013
That's pretty good. This guy's nuts.

01:05:31.096 --> 01:05:33.432
He said, "Grand Central Station. "

01:05:33.682 --> 01:05:36.352
Grand Central Terminal is the train station.

01:05:36.435 --> 01:05:39.104
- Grand Central Station is the post office.
- Is the post office.

01:05:39.188 --> 01:05:40.481
He's wrong.
Who's wrong?

01:05:40.564 --> 01:05:43.776
Perp One.
Trains don't pass through Grand Central.

01:05:44.485 --> 01:05:45.861
It's the last stop for every train.

01:05:45.945 --> 01:05:48.781
- What about the subway? They run through.
- Metro-North goes there.

01:05:48.864 --> 01:05:50.783
- How the fuck do you know?
- Metro-North goes there!

01:05:50.866 --> 01:05:52.326
No. Metro-North starts there.

01:05:52.409 --> 01:05:54.495
What are you guys talking about?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:05:54.578 --> 01:05:57.915
- Metro-North goes through!
- Let's just get the sandwiches.

01:05:58.249 --> 01:06:01.836
- Metro-North...
- Deal is, he said, "Passes through. "

01:06:01.919 --> 01:06:04.004
Yeah, but the Metro-North goes up
there, though.

01:06:04.088 --> 01:06:06.465
Look, shut up. It doesn't matter, anyway.

01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:07.842
<i>I know what he meant.</i>

01:06:07.925 --> 01:06:09.552
<i>What he said is one thing,
but what he meant is another.</i>

01:06:09.635 --> 01:06:11.011
<i>Yeah.
That's always a problem, isn't it?</i>

01:06:11.095 --> 01:06:12.179
<i>Sandwiches.</i>

01:06:12.263 --> 01:06:13.848
<i>I'm on it, I'm on it.</i>

01:06:15.975 --> 01:06:19.145
You know, right now I could go for
a nice kosher hot dog and a beer.

01:06:19.228 --> 01:06:21.355
I had Met tickets tonight.
And Pedro's pitching!

01:06:21.438 --> 01:06:23.149
They're gonna get their asses
kicked anyway.

01:06:23.232 --> 01:06:25.943
Tell me about it. I'm better off here.
I'm glad they didn't separate us.

01:06:26.026 --> 01:06:28.696
- Do you think they're terrorists?
- They're robbers, not terrorists.

01:06:28.779 --> 01:06:30.447
How do you know? They could be Al-Qaeda.

01:06:30.531 --> 01:06:32.366
Trust me. I've studied these things.

01:06:32.449 --> 01:06:34.201
- What are you, Mossad?
- No. I was a lawyer.

01:06:34.285 --> 01:06:37.413
Now I teach courses at Columbia Law
on genocide, slave labour,

01:06:37.496 --> 01:06:39.290
<i>- war reparation claims.
- Mira.</i>

01:06:39.373 --> 01:06:42.751
- Can I sue anybody when this is over?
- Oh, sure. Go nuts.

01:06:43.043 --> 01:06:44.420
Go meshuga.

01:06:47.381 --> 01:06:49.592
Now that's a good looking shithole.

01:06:59.685 --> 01:07:01.395
- Hello?
Hey, baby, how you doing?

01:07:01.479 --> 01:07:03.481
<i>Baby, I'm worried about you.
You coming home?</i>

01:07:03.564 --> 01:07:05.065
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Soon.

01:07:05.149 --> 01:07:07.651
It's gonna be a long night, though,
so don't wait up for me.

01:07:07.735 --> 01:07:09.236
Why don't you let me come down there?

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.906
Because I don't want to be
distracted by you, that's why.

01:07:11.989 --> 01:07:15.242
<i>Well, if you're still there when I come
on duty in the morning, you will see me.</i>

01:07:15.326 --> 01:07:18.412
<i>- I cannot wait. I cannot wait.
- So, how you doing?</i>

01:07:18.746 --> 01:07:21.457
It's all right. We got a couple
of the hostages out. Thanks a lot.

01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:25.002
- No, no. How you doing?
- I'm doing okay. I'm doing all right.

01:07:25.085 --> 01:07:28.797
<i>Oh, I saw the Mayor on TV. He said
you're doing a great job. I saw you, too.</i>

01:07:28.881 --> 01:07:30.508
<i>- You saw me on TV?
- Yeah.</i>

01:07:30.591 --> 01:07:33.093
<i>- How'd I look?
- You looked good, baby. Real good.</i>

01:07:33.177 --> 01:07:36.055
- All right, listen. I got to go.
- All right. Hey.

01:07:36.263 --> 01:07:39.308
- Keep your head down.
- All right, I will. Love you.

01:07:40.476 --> 01:07:41.685
Come on.

01:07:44.605 --> 01:07:47.149
So, are we clear about the ground rules?

01:07:47.775 --> 01:07:50.611
- There's no need to worry, Detective.
- I get paid to worry, okay?

01:07:50.694 --> 01:07:52.321
I just need you to look me in the eye

01:07:52.404 --> 01:07:56.075
and make me believe that you understand
everything we talked about.

01:07:56.158 --> 01:07:57.618
- I understand.
- Okay.

01:08:02.957 --> 01:08:05.125
Someone here wants to talk to you.

01:08:07.378 --> 01:08:08.879
- Hello?
- Who is this?

01:08:09.004 --> 01:08:11.006
<i>Let's not get into any names.</i>

01:08:11.090 --> 01:08:13.509
<i>- What matters is what I can offer you.
- And what's that?</i>

01:08:13.592 --> 01:08:16.095
Well, if I can be assured
that certain interests are protected,

01:08:16.178 --> 01:08:18.389
I might be able to help you get
what you came for.

01:08:18.471 --> 01:08:19.723
I doubt that.

01:08:20.850 --> 01:08:23.810
Tell me about these interests
that you are trying to protect.

01:08:23.894 --> 01:08:25.563
Why don't you let me worry about that?

01:08:25.645 --> 01:08:29.149
Now, what is it you were hoping to get out
of all this?

01:08:29.358 --> 01:08:31.318
- Rich, of course.
- Of course.

01:08:31.402 --> 01:08:33.821
But you may have bitten off
more than you can chew.

01:08:33.904 --> 01:08:36.740
<i>- How?
- I can't discuss that on the phone.</i>

01:08:36.991 --> 01:08:39.076
- You work for the bank?
- No.

01:08:39.702 --> 01:08:41.370
<i>And you're not a cop.</i>

01:08:41.828 --> 01:08:43.163
That's right.

01:08:44.874 --> 01:08:46.250
Come on in.

01:08:53.465 --> 01:08:55.009
You got 10 minutes. No more.

01:08:55.091 --> 01:08:56.844
If you're not out
before the lights come back on,

01:08:56.926 --> 01:08:58.511
you can stay inside until this thing is over.

01:08:58.595 --> 01:09:01.055
- You don't need to threaten me.
- That's not a threat, lady, but this is.

01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:04.268
I know this game is a mile over my head,
but I'm telling you, if you fuck me over...

01:09:04.350 --> 01:09:06.520
I got where I am by collecting friends,
not enemies.

01:09:06.604 --> 01:09:08.104
Trust me, okay?

01:09:08.939 --> 01:09:10.441
You're on your own.

01:09:36.258 --> 01:09:38.426
What makes you think
I need help?

01:09:39.553 --> 01:09:41.971
Well,
the hundred people outside, for starters.

01:09:42.055 --> 01:09:43.390
It's not a problem.

01:09:43.474 --> 01:09:46.519
And they're fuelling
your jet right now as we speak.

01:09:47.394 --> 01:09:49.479
Come on. You're not that stupid.

01:09:50.439 --> 01:09:52.233
Here's what I'm thinking.

01:09:52.316 --> 01:09:54.902
If you give up now,
I can ensure that you'll serve the minimum.

01:09:54.985 --> 01:09:57.154
I'm thinking three years,
four years at the most.

01:09:57.238 --> 01:09:58.322
You can arrange that?

01:09:58.405 --> 01:10:00.449
Well, you haven't hurt anyone
or stolen anything,

01:10:00.533 --> 01:10:02.743
so yes, as a matter of fact, I can.

01:10:03.369 --> 01:10:06.247
- It's not good enough.
- Well, I wasn't finished.

01:10:06.413 --> 01:10:09.333
When you get out, you'll have $2 million.

01:10:09.625 --> 01:10:11.919
Will I? How?

01:10:12.002 --> 01:10:15.172
We'll put it someplace safe and it'll be
waiting for you when you get out.

01:10:15.256 --> 01:10:16.465
Thanks.

01:10:17.258 --> 01:10:18.801
But no, thanks.

01:10:18.884 --> 01:10:22.096
Oh, come on. I made you such a sweet offer.

01:10:22.179 --> 01:10:24.598
I really don't think you have much
in the way of alternatives.

01:10:24.682 --> 01:10:28.644
Why don't you talk to me about these
interests that you're in here to protect?

01:10:28.727 --> 01:10:30.437
- I'm afraid I can't.
- I can.

01:10:30.521 --> 01:10:32.231
Let me tell you a story.

01:10:34.733 --> 01:10:39.071
During World War II, there was an American
working for a bank in Switzerland.

01:10:40.281 --> 01:10:42.783
<i>Now, I don't need to tell you
that this period in history</i>

01:10:42.867 --> 01:10:45.786
<i>was rife with opportunity
for people of low morals.</i>

01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:47.580
<i>People like this man.</i>

01:10:48.330 --> 01:10:52.626
<i>He used his position with the Nazis
to enrich himself while all around him</i>

01:10:52.710 --> 01:10:55.754
<i>people were being stripped
of everything they owned.</i>

01:10:56.797 --> 01:11:00.801
Then he used his blood money
to start a bank.

01:11:00.885 --> 01:11:02.011
Now,

01:11:03.637 --> 01:11:06.765
does this sound like
it might be the man you work for?

01:11:07.391 --> 01:11:10.019
<i>Or am I just whistling Dixie out of my ass?</i>

01:11:10.644 --> 01:11:13.230
- I believe we understand each other.
- Good.

01:11:14.732 --> 01:11:16.650
So, what the hell can you do for me

01:11:16.734 --> 01:11:20.404
since I clearly know more than you do,
and I've planned this to perfection?

01:11:20.488 --> 01:11:24.700
Believe me, if I need to,
I can change your entire programme.

01:11:24.783 --> 01:11:26.869
So, the sooner
that you stop being my problem

01:11:26.952 --> 01:11:30.456
and you start becoming my solution,
the better off you'll be.

01:11:30.831 --> 01:11:33.042
- What is it you want?
- Two minutes.

01:11:33.125 --> 01:11:36.462
The safety deposit box room.
I just need to go to one box.

01:11:38.297 --> 01:11:39.840
Looking for this?

01:11:41.175 --> 01:11:44.053
This could be very embarrassing
to your employer.

01:11:44.637 --> 01:11:46.806
He should have destroyed this
a long time ago.

01:11:46.889 --> 01:11:48.849
He didn't, so now it's mine.

01:11:51.268 --> 01:11:54.230
Now, if the day ever comes
where I have to stand before a judge

01:11:54.313 --> 01:11:56.190
and account for what I did here,

01:11:56.273 --> 01:11:59.485
you and your boss
will do whatever it takes to help me.

01:12:00.444 --> 01:12:02.863
You get out of here with that envelope,

01:12:03.364 --> 01:12:05.533
and we'll pay you a lot of money.

01:12:05.866 --> 01:12:07.159
I'll keep that in mind.

01:12:07.243 --> 01:12:10.162
You're not gonna tell me how you're
planning to get out of here, are you?

01:12:10.246 --> 01:12:13.457
I'm gonna walk right out the front door.
Anything else?

01:12:13.541 --> 01:12:16.210
- How did you know about all this?
- Doesn't matter.

01:12:16.293 --> 01:12:19.713
Fact is, all lies, all evil deeds, they stink.

01:12:20.172 --> 01:12:23.509
You can cover them up for a while,
but they don't go away.

01:12:23.592 --> 01:12:25.886
- Murder will out?
- Precisely.

01:12:26.762 --> 01:12:29.098
Well, I still don't get what you're
doing here.

01:12:29.181 --> 01:12:30.266
Really?

01:12:31.809 --> 01:12:32.935
Good.

01:12:37.356 --> 01:12:38.482
So, we spoke.

01:12:38.566 --> 01:12:40.276
Oh, no. You're gonna have to give me
more than that.

01:12:40.359 --> 01:12:42.027
- Let me have this window, fellows.
- Yes, sir.

01:12:42.111 --> 01:12:44.905
I told him that, well,
since he hadn't killed anyone,

01:12:44.989 --> 01:12:47.950
it wasn't too late to surrender
and get off with a lighter sentence.

01:12:48.033 --> 01:12:49.118
And?

01:12:49.827 --> 01:12:51.745
And that was basically it.

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:55.124
You know, I don't ordinarily get offended

01:12:55.207 --> 01:12:58.419
the first time somebody treats me
like an idiot, but you are pushing it.

01:12:58.502 --> 01:13:02.089
Now, I know you did not go in there
to tell this guy something he already knew.

01:13:02.173 --> 01:13:03.507
Talk to me.

01:13:04.049 --> 01:13:05.134
Look, Detective.

01:13:05.217 --> 01:13:07.720
Our arrangement doesn't include me
giving you a detailed explanation.

01:13:07.803 --> 01:13:09.597
I say it does, okay?

01:13:09.930 --> 01:13:11.348
Okay, you don't own me.

01:13:11.432 --> 01:13:14.602
This cheque-cashing thing, this coke bust,
I can face that on my own.

01:13:14.685 --> 01:13:17.229
I know what I did and what I didn't do.

01:13:17.313 --> 01:13:19.773
- Talk to me.
- Off the record?

01:13:19.857 --> 01:13:23.777
"Off the... " Everything about you
is off the record. Just talk to me.

01:13:24.111 --> 01:13:26.447
- Well, I gave him an incentive.
- Okay.

01:13:26.572 --> 01:13:30.618
- Did he go for it?
- No. But I'd say he's considering it.

01:13:31.952 --> 01:13:33.621
He's smart, isn't he?

01:13:33.871 --> 01:13:35.581
- He thinks he is.
- Yeah.

01:13:36.081 --> 01:13:38.751
One of your types, like the Ivy League type?

01:13:39.293 --> 01:13:41.962
- Clearly well educated.
- That's what I'm talking about.

01:13:42.046 --> 01:13:44.131
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

01:13:44.215 --> 01:13:48.177
You talk like him, so think like him.
What do you think he's gonna do?

01:13:49.845 --> 01:13:52.264
- Well, he's not gonna kill anyone.
- How do you know?

01:13:52.348 --> 01:13:55.100
- Because he's not a murderer.
- How do you know?

01:13:55.184 --> 01:13:57.353
I got news for you.
Most of the guys up in Sing Sing

01:13:57.436 --> 01:13:59.146
weren't murderers
until they killed somebody.

01:13:59.230 --> 01:14:03.234
You never know what a person will do
until you push him into a corner.

01:14:03.484 --> 01:14:05.903
But it doesn't seem
like you've pushed him into a corner.

01:14:05.986 --> 01:14:09.365
It doesn't, does it?
Seems more like he chose the corner.

01:14:10.991 --> 01:14:12.284
You're right.

01:14:13.285 --> 01:14:14.829
So, you through?

01:14:15.871 --> 01:14:18.165
- I guess. Are you saying I'm dismissed?
- Yes, I am.

01:14:18.249 --> 01:14:20.876
You got a card, in case I need to call you?

01:14:21.418 --> 01:14:24.338
Please don't take this personally, but no.

01:14:24.505 --> 01:14:26.090
I don't think you can afford me.

01:14:26.173 --> 01:14:30.136
Well, don't take this personally, Miss White.
Kiss my black ass, okay?

01:14:30.302 --> 01:14:34.515
Careful, Detective Frazier.
My bite's much worse than my bark.

01:14:40.521 --> 01:14:42.606
- So, how old are you, Brian?
- Eight and three-quarters.

01:14:42.690 --> 01:14:45.276
Eight and three-quarters. Big boy.

01:14:46.485 --> 01:14:48.612
- Were you scared in there?
- No.

01:14:48.696 --> 01:14:51.365
- No? Not at all, huh?
- Nope. I'm from Brooklyn.

01:14:51.448 --> 01:14:53.033
You're from Brooklyn, huh? I understand.

01:14:53.117 --> 01:14:54.827
- Guns don't scare me.
- They don't scare you?

01:14:54.910 --> 01:14:56.328
- Brave, too, huh?
- Yeah.

01:14:56.412 --> 01:14:59.874
So the guys that had the guns,
do you remember them saying anything?

01:14:59.957 --> 01:15:01.834
- Yeah.
- What'd they say?

01:15:01.917 --> 01:15:03.419
They asked me about my game.

01:15:03.502 --> 01:15:06.172
- Who did?
- The guy that robbed the bank. Duh.

01:15:06.839 --> 01:15:08.549
Son, be respectful.

01:15:08.632 --> 01:15:11.385
Okay, Brooklyn.
But it... Was he the one in charge?

01:15:11.469 --> 01:15:12.553
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

01:15:12.845 --> 01:15:15.473
And you don't remember anything else?

01:15:15.639 --> 01:15:17.183
He was kind of tall.

01:15:17.975 --> 01:15:19.185
He had a mask.

01:15:19.268 --> 01:15:23.230
Brian, you think you can recognise him
in any of these pictures?

01:15:24.190 --> 01:15:26.484
Take your time. Have a good look.

01:15:27.026 --> 01:15:29.737
Let's keep that over there. Just take a look.

01:15:36.243 --> 01:15:39.455
- With the mask, they look all the same.
- It's true.

01:15:41.207 --> 01:15:44.168
With the mask, they all look the same.
That's right, Brian.

01:15:44.251 --> 01:15:47.588
Attempted robbery. Liquor store.

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:51.425
Well, this was a real step up
for a small-timer like you, huh?

01:15:52.051 --> 01:15:53.886
I got to hand it to you, Pablo.

01:15:53.969 --> 01:15:57.515
First of all, it's Paul. Not Pablo, okay?

01:15:57.723 --> 01:15:58.808
Excuse me.

01:15:59.975 --> 01:16:01.811
- You want some gum?
- No.

01:16:02.603 --> 01:16:04.271
And second, I didn't do it, all right?

01:16:04.355 --> 01:16:06.857
What? I made a few mistakes
when I was a kid.

01:16:06.941 --> 01:16:10.402
I was out with some friends
and they held up a liquor store.

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:13.155
What was I supposed to do?

01:16:14.949 --> 01:16:17.117
Where'd you grow up, you Wassa Wassa,
Park Avenue?

01:16:17.201 --> 01:16:19.745
- What's that? Wassa what? What'd you say?
- Wassa Wassa.

01:16:21.038 --> 01:16:23.290
You know, a person
that don't come to your neighbourhood.

01:16:23.374 --> 01:16:25.668
How do you say "Rikers Island" in Spanish?

01:16:25.751 --> 01:16:27.336
What about these two?

01:16:27.670 --> 01:16:29.129
That ring a bell?

01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:31.590
These two? No.

01:16:31.674 --> 01:16:32.925
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

01:16:33.008 --> 01:16:34.426
Don't they look suspicious to you?

01:16:34.510 --> 01:16:38.013
I mean, I would think that you would
want to know who they are.

01:16:38.097 --> 01:16:39.265
No.

01:16:39.348 --> 01:16:41.016
- Well, thank you very much.
- Thank you.

01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:43.811
Hey, just out of curiosity
do you know anything about diamonds?

01:16:43.894 --> 01:16:45.980
A bit. What do you need?

01:16:46.063 --> 01:16:48.315
What do you think a guy like me
should pay for a diamond ring?

01:16:48.399 --> 01:16:50.359
Depends. How many carats?

01:16:50.442 --> 01:16:52.444
If you'd like, I could give you
my nephew's number.

01:16:52.528 --> 01:16:53.904
- Okay.
- You'll get a very good deal.

01:16:53.988 --> 01:16:55.990
What do you have on underneath?

01:16:56.157 --> 01:16:58.367
- Excuse me?
- Underneath your painter's coat?

01:16:58.450 --> 01:17:00.661
- What do you have on underneath?
- Clothing.

01:17:00.744 --> 01:17:02.830
Could you show us, please?

01:17:07.084 --> 01:17:09.128
You see, there's just you
and one other woman

01:17:09.211 --> 01:17:11.797
that fit the physical description
of the female suspect.

01:17:11.881 --> 01:17:13.090
What's that?

01:17:14.508 --> 01:17:17.803
It's your height, your age, and your...

01:17:18.679 --> 01:17:20.055
Your cup size.

01:17:20.139 --> 01:17:23.601
So, I violated Section 34 double-D?

01:17:23.684 --> 01:17:25.603
That's what you're telling me?

01:17:29.231 --> 01:17:32.485
How dumb do these morons have to be
to think they're gonna get a plane?

01:17:32.568 --> 01:17:33.694
This guy's no moron.

01:17:33.777 --> 01:17:36.530
I don't just mean him. Any hostage taker.

01:17:37.907 --> 01:17:40.534
Those ragheads at the Munich Olympics.

01:17:40.993 --> 01:17:42.620
Who the fuck ever got a plane?

01:17:42.703 --> 01:17:45.372
Shit, and these days?
This guy doesn't know that?

01:17:45.456 --> 01:17:46.624
<i>The area is flooded</i>

01:17:46.707 --> 01:17:49.126
<i>with law enforcement right now.
Snipers are on rooftops...</i>

01:17:49.210 --> 01:17:50.503
What you doing there, Keith?

01:17:50.586 --> 01:17:52.338
He wants a plane.
I'm gonna give him a plane.

01:17:52.421 --> 01:17:55.174
- What happened to playing it by the book?
- That's what's bugging me.

01:17:55.257 --> 01:18:00.095
It's like the other team read the book, too,
and they know exactly what we're gonna do.

01:18:02.556 --> 01:18:06.060
This whole time,
we're trying to stall him, right?

01:18:06.143 --> 01:18:07.937
Wrong. They're the ones that are stalling.

01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:10.439
Think about it.
The bullshit questions, the Albanian thing...

01:18:10.523 --> 01:18:12.024
So, you're saying he what?

01:18:12.107 --> 01:18:15.736
I'm saying that he wants
to give us more time. He makes demands.

01:18:15.861 --> 01:18:19.114
He gives us deadlines. We stall.
Then he gives us more time.

01:18:19.198 --> 01:18:20.574
I don't think he's in a rush.

01:18:20.658 --> 01:18:22.993
- Why?
- That's what I'm gonna find out.

01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:45.683
- Yeah.
- Your plane is ready.

01:18:45.766 --> 01:18:46.934
Is that a fact?

01:18:47.017 --> 01:18:49.478
<i>That's a fact, but I'm gonna need something
from you first.</i>

01:18:49.562 --> 01:18:52.648
I'm gonna need to come in there
and make sure the hostages are okay.

01:18:52.731 --> 01:18:54.441
You'll see them when they get on the bus.

01:18:54.525 --> 01:18:58.070
I just need to make sure
you're not leaving any bodies behind.

01:19:00.406 --> 01:19:02.158
Meet me at the front door.

01:19:08.205 --> 01:19:11.959
- What the hell just happened?
- You got to be crazy to go in there.

01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:02.885
Down the stairs.

01:20:11.227 --> 01:20:13.062
- Gum?
- Excuse me?

01:20:13.312 --> 01:20:16.315
- Would you like some gum?
- No, thank you.

01:21:05.698 --> 01:21:07.199
Let me take the kid.

01:21:08.909 --> 01:21:10.035
No.

01:21:10.911 --> 01:21:12.079
Any more?

01:21:12.746 --> 01:21:14.874
There are some who misbehaved.

01:21:20.921 --> 01:21:22.590
Please help me!

01:21:23.466 --> 01:21:24.842
Please help us!

01:21:24.925 --> 01:21:27.386
Please help us! Please!

01:21:28.053 --> 01:21:30.181
We're gonna get you all out of here.

01:21:30.264 --> 01:21:32.016
I promise you.

01:21:32.808 --> 01:21:34.018
Tour is over.

01:21:42.485 --> 01:21:45.905
- Can I ask you a question?
- There is nothing to talk about.

01:21:46.530 --> 01:21:48.240
What were you planning on doing

01:21:48.324 --> 01:21:51.243
if you actually got
the plane and the pilots, huh?

01:21:51.494 --> 01:21:54.246
- Excuse me?
- You don't want a plane. You never did.

01:21:54.330 --> 01:21:57.625
Who ever heard of bank robbers
escaping on a plane with 50 hostages?

01:21:57.708 --> 01:22:01.253
<i>You saw Dog Day Afternoon. You're stalling.
Why? I don't know.</i>

01:22:02.004 --> 01:22:04.465
What's the matter?
You can't get into the safe?

01:22:04.548 --> 01:22:06.091
Perhaps.

01:22:07.009 --> 01:22:08.469
There's two ways out of this.

01:22:08.552 --> 01:22:12.473
The easy way, we walk out the front door
together, or the hard boys cut the power,

01:22:12.556 --> 01:22:15.392
hit you with the tear gas,
and come in strong through the glass.

01:22:15.476 --> 01:22:18.437
It's your choice. You don't want that.
I don't want that.

01:22:18.521 --> 01:22:20.731
And, you know, they'd like to do it tonight.

01:22:20.815 --> 01:22:22.650
You got night vision?

01:22:23.150 --> 01:22:25.820
- You got gas masks?
- Maybe.

01:22:27.029 --> 01:22:29.532
- I'm this close to ordering it.
- Let's cut the crap.

01:22:29.615 --> 01:22:32.618
First, you don't order an assault
when no hostages have been killed

01:22:32.701 --> 01:22:34.203
and there's no immediate threat.

01:22:34.286 --> 01:22:37.373
Second, if it ends that way,
whatever happens,

01:22:37.456 --> 01:22:39.124
you don't get to be the hero.

01:22:39.208 --> 01:22:41.377
You want to bullshit me, try harder.

01:22:42.169 --> 01:22:43.337
Let's go.

01:22:45.256 --> 01:22:46.423
Okay.

01:22:53.931 --> 01:22:56.892
I tell you what. My ass is covered, sport.

01:22:56.976 --> 01:22:59.603
But I would not get too comfortable
in here if I were you.

01:22:59.687 --> 01:23:02.356
No? I got the cable guy
coming on Wednesday.

01:23:02.982 --> 01:23:05.693
- Why don't you just walk out the door?
- I will.

01:23:07.444 --> 01:23:10.656
I'm gonna walk out of that door
when I'm good and ready.

01:23:10.906 --> 01:23:12.908
Can I get you to do that today?

01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:15.995
I didn't think so.

01:23:16.078 --> 01:23:17.371
Any other proposals?

01:23:17.454 --> 01:23:19.665
Oh, please. Do not say "proposals. "

01:23:19.748 --> 01:23:22.501
My girlfriend, she wants a proposal from me.

01:23:22.585 --> 01:23:26.255
- You think you're too young to get married?
- No, I'm not too young. Too broke.

01:23:26.338 --> 01:23:28.591
Maybe I should rob a bank.

01:23:29.633 --> 01:23:31.343
You love each other?

01:23:31.886 --> 01:23:33.721
Yeah. Yeah, we do.

01:23:33.846 --> 01:23:36.015
Then money shouldn't really matter.

01:23:36.599 --> 01:23:38.225
Thank you, bank robber.

01:23:38.601 --> 01:23:41.854
I'm just saying money can't buy love.

01:23:43.606 --> 01:23:46.275
Thank you very much. I'm...

01:23:47.693 --> 01:23:49.945
I'm learning so much today, you know?

01:23:50.696 --> 01:23:53.532
Look, why don't we go across
the street to the Killarney Rose, huh?

01:23:53.616 --> 01:23:55.451
Forget about
this dangerous hostage situation.

01:23:55.534 --> 01:23:58.078
- I'll buy you a beer. My treat.
- Thanks, Detective,

01:23:58.162 --> 01:24:01.290
but I'm trying to stay away from bars,
if you know what I mean.

01:24:01.373 --> 01:24:05.419
Well, if you change your mind
there's still a standing offer, all right?

01:24:10.633 --> 01:24:12.802
Cellblock or the graveyard?

01:24:12.885 --> 01:24:14.678
Prison whites or a toe tag?

01:24:14.762 --> 01:24:18.224
- Make up your mind. Tick tock, tick tock.
- Hey! Hey!

01:24:19.141 --> 01:24:20.434
We done?

01:24:23.187 --> 01:24:25.314
You just crossed the fucking line!

01:24:27.107 --> 01:24:29.318
Buses, Kojak, parked outside.

01:24:29.819 --> 01:24:31.487
You think I'm bluffing?

01:24:32.655 --> 01:24:34.990
You roll the dice and see what happens.

01:24:43.999 --> 01:24:46.001
All right. Now get the bunker up.

01:24:46.085 --> 01:24:48.087
- So, what's up?
- Got him right where I want him.

01:24:48.170 --> 01:24:49.338
Yeah? Where's that?

01:24:49.421 --> 01:24:52.842
Right behind me with my pants
around my ankles, but it's a start.

01:24:52.925 --> 01:24:54.343
Jesus Christ.

01:25:09.150 --> 01:25:10.484
- What the fuck, man?
- How long?

01:25:10.568 --> 01:25:12.027
- He got the drop on you!
- Two.

01:25:12.111 --> 01:25:13.487
- How long?
- What if he saw your face?

01:25:13.571 --> 01:25:14.905
- Two.
- What if I didn't have my gun?

01:25:14.989 --> 01:25:16.740
Two, maybe three hours.

01:25:16.824 --> 01:25:19.994
You know, you're letting this cop
get too fucking close.

01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:24.290
What happened?

01:25:24.373 --> 01:25:26.250
I gave him every excuse
to blow my brains out.

01:25:26.375 --> 01:25:27.501
Yeah.

01:25:27.585 --> 01:25:30.671
He doesn't bite. Why? He ain't the type.

01:25:30.754 --> 01:25:33.215
Let's just step back
and think about this for a second.

01:25:33.299 --> 01:25:36.844
We know that they planned this whole thing.
The tape, the cameras, the costumes.

01:25:36.927 --> 01:25:39.221
There was a game plan,
but it never included aeroplanes.

01:25:39.305 --> 01:25:41.974
He's up to something but it ain't violence.

01:25:45.978 --> 01:25:48.564
<i>I'm listening.
How's the reception?</i>

01:25:48.939 --> 01:25:51.358
<i>- Excuse me?
- The camera on the truck.</i>

01:25:51.775 --> 01:25:54.403
<i>Give me a close-up
on the second-floor window.</i>

01:25:55.112 --> 01:25:57.072
- Rourke?
- I'm on it, I'm on it.

01:26:08.584 --> 01:26:11.086
No, no, no, no, no, no! Fuck!

01:26:11.170 --> 01:26:12.505
Oh, shit.

01:26:16.091 --> 01:26:18.928
Keith! Keith! Keith!

01:26:25.226 --> 01:26:27.603
What are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

01:26:27.686 --> 01:26:29.772
You mean beyond the obvious?

01:26:29.939 --> 01:26:32.399
That's what I mean.
Come on, this ain't no bank robbery!

01:26:32.483 --> 01:26:35.361
This is your fault.
I told you to get the buses.

01:26:35.444 --> 01:26:38.864
Fuck you! I didn't kill anybody.

01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:43.661
I got 50 more people in here.
You fuck with me again,

01:26:43.744 --> 01:26:45.913
I'll give you two
of the longest days of your life.

01:26:45.996 --> 01:26:50.292
All right, look, just tell me what
it is you really want and I'll get it for you.

01:26:50.376 --> 01:26:53.170
- I promise.
- I've told you. Two buses, a plane.

01:26:53.254 --> 01:26:55.965
Right, right. And box seats
behind home plate at Yankee Stadium.

01:26:56.048 --> 01:26:58.425
Come on, don't bullshit a bullshitter.

01:26:58.968 --> 01:27:01.428
You planned every inch of this thing
right from the start.

01:27:01.512 --> 01:27:06.016
You got everybody marching to your beat,
including me, and I'm through buying it.

01:27:08.477 --> 01:27:10.646
You're too damn smart to be a cop.

01:27:10.729 --> 01:27:12.481
Now get the fuck out of here.

01:27:12.565 --> 01:27:14.483
What? You going to shoot me?

01:27:15.109 --> 01:27:16.652
Do it. Shit, you got nothing to lose.

01:27:16.735 --> 01:27:19.363
I damn sure ain't got nothing to lose,
so shoot me.

01:27:19.446 --> 01:27:20.614
Do it.

01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:22.992
- Shoot me.
- Fuck you.

01:27:23.701 --> 01:27:26.203
Tell them to send someone sane over here.

01:27:55.149 --> 01:27:56.650
We got a big problem.

01:27:56.734 --> 01:27:58.986
Hey, Detective, this ain't your day.

01:28:05.576 --> 01:28:07.244
How you doing, Captain?

01:28:09.121 --> 01:28:11.207
Look, I know you
put your trust in me and I just...

01:28:11.290 --> 01:28:14.043
Well, you're a good cop.
Frazier, I need more like you.

01:28:14.126 --> 01:28:16.462
But if you're going down on this one,
I can't go with you.

01:28:16.545 --> 01:28:18.130
You got to understand this, though, sir...

01:28:18.214 --> 01:28:20.382
No, no, no. Let me just tell you
what my problem is, okay?

01:28:20.466 --> 01:28:22.426
I go to bed, everything's hunky-dory.

01:28:22.510 --> 01:28:24.887
I get a call at 3:15, and there's what?
A dead hostage.

01:28:24.970 --> 01:28:28.140
- Right, right, right. But I can end this...
- It is ended.

01:28:28.224 --> 01:28:30.142
See, you think I got options.

01:28:30.226 --> 01:28:32.520
I got to answer to the Chief of D's.

01:28:32.603 --> 01:28:35.439
Darius is calling the shots on this. That's it.

01:28:52.122 --> 01:28:53.916
Hey, Sarge.

01:28:54.208 --> 01:28:56.252
- What'd he say?
- That's it.

01:28:57.586 --> 01:28:58.754
Shit.

01:29:00.256 --> 01:29:02.925
It's a tactical nightmare.
I know.

01:29:03.008 --> 01:29:06.053
Well, first, this is the only way in.

01:29:06.137 --> 01:29:08.389
Then we got to make it up the stairs blind.

01:29:08.472 --> 01:29:10.766
Once we get up there,
we're right out in the open.

01:29:10.850 --> 01:29:15.062
<i>They have the advantage of cover.
They can pick us off like sitting ducks.</i>

01:29:15.396 --> 01:29:18.941
<i>Then if we make it across the floor
and down the stairs,</i>

01:29:19.024 --> 01:29:22.361
we still can't tell the homies
from the good guys until they shoot at us.

01:29:22.444 --> 01:29:25.531
Even if it isn't rigged with explosives,
it's still a fucking nightmare.

01:29:31.078 --> 01:29:32.788
Move! Move! Move!

01:29:33.622 --> 01:29:35.291
Open the door!

01:29:49.013 --> 01:29:51.140
Keep moving.
To the right.

01:29:51.223 --> 01:29:52.683
Watch the hands,
watch the hands.

01:29:52.808 --> 01:29:55.269
And let's not forget the possibility
of hostages being killed.

01:29:55.352 --> 01:29:57.146
Right now! Put the gun down!

01:29:57.229 --> 01:30:00.065
Back off or I shoot! I said back off!

01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:03.486
<i>Well, our best hope
is to separate them from the hostages.</i>

01:30:03.569 --> 01:30:06.322
If we can get two or three upstairs
and take them out?

01:30:06.405 --> 01:30:07.573
Kill them?

01:30:15.789 --> 01:30:17.500
Gun! Gun! Gun!

01:30:26.675 --> 01:30:28.177
What if there's more than four?

01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:32.973
Yeah, well, that's what's so nuts about it.
Anybody in a painter's suit could be a perp.

01:30:33.098 --> 01:30:36.477
Maybe we should dress our guys up
like a bunch of painters.

01:30:37.228 --> 01:30:41.273
And we should use rubber bullets.
Take head shots. Put their lights out.

01:30:43.025 --> 01:30:44.693
Not a bad idea.
Yeah.

01:30:44.777 --> 01:30:46.779
<i>Rubber bullets it is, baby.</i>

01:30:51.325 --> 01:30:53.077
If this goes down wrong,

01:30:54.078 --> 01:30:57.331
they're going to dump this whole mess
in your lap, you know?

01:30:57.414 --> 01:30:59.208
- I'm making First Grade.
- What?

01:30:59.291 --> 01:31:02.545
I'm making Detective First Grade.
Things ain't all they appear to be.

01:31:02.628 --> 01:31:06.715
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Detective First Grade Keith Frazier.

01:31:06.799 --> 01:31:08.884
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Yes.

01:31:08.968 --> 01:31:11.679
Thank the Mayor
and our mystery guest for that.

01:31:12.388 --> 01:31:14.390
You cut a deal with those guys?

01:31:14.807 --> 01:31:17.059
Never make First Grade? Shit.

01:31:17.935 --> 01:31:19.812
Worked too hard to let that happen.

01:31:19.895 --> 01:31:22.648
Everybody's getting theirs.
I'm gonna get mine.

01:31:24.483 --> 01:31:26.068
I'll be outside.

01:31:31.907 --> 01:31:33.450
What a day, what a day.

01:31:33.534 --> 01:31:37.454
Detective, they're gonna storm that bank
without you? It's not right.

01:31:38.414 --> 01:31:41.792
So, tell me about the kid
who pointed the gun at you, the 12-year-old.

01:31:41.876 --> 01:31:43.502
- Now?
- Yeah.

01:31:44.211 --> 01:31:45.963
Last year, up in the 33rd,

01:31:46.046 --> 01:31:48.883
I was breaking up a fight
about a half a block from the high school.

01:31:48.966 --> 01:31:51.677
This one little spic is getting
his clock cleaned by another one.

01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:55.264
Do me a favour, Sergeant.
Just tone down the colour commentary.

01:31:57.099 --> 01:31:59.351
So I bust up the fight,

01:31:59.435 --> 01:32:03.105
I turn around
and this kid is pointing a.22 at my chest.

01:32:03.189 --> 01:32:07.276
- Is that right? Now, which kid was this?
- Another kid, an African-American.

01:32:07.359 --> 01:32:08.903
- An African-American, right?
- Yeah.

01:32:08.986 --> 01:32:10.529
Came out of nowhere. I didn't see him.

01:32:10.613 --> 01:32:11.739
So, what'd you do?

01:32:11.822 --> 01:32:13.949
What did I do then?
I'll tell you what I did then.

01:32:14.033 --> 01:32:17.244
I got shot in the fucking chest.
That's what I did then.

01:32:17.369 --> 01:32:19.663
Yeah, so you'll pardon
my euphemisms, Detective,

01:32:19.747 --> 01:32:23.334
but I would rather wind up an old bigot
than a handsome young corpse.

01:32:23.417 --> 01:32:25.044
Now, no offence, Detective,

01:32:25.127 --> 01:32:27.588
but I'm just trying
to keep them away from us.

01:32:27.671 --> 01:32:30.883
Now, what do you say we just
get these people safely out of the bank?

01:32:30.966 --> 01:32:32.092
I hear that.

01:32:32.176 --> 01:32:35.304
And I'll try and watch
what I say in the future.

01:32:35.387 --> 01:32:37.431
You never know who's listening.

01:32:51.821 --> 01:32:53.364
What are you doing?

01:32:53.447 --> 01:32:54.698
Jesus. Shit.

01:32:55.282 --> 01:32:56.867
They bugged us.

01:32:57.409 --> 01:32:58.702
They bugged us.

01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:03.749
Darius!

01:33:04.375 --> 01:33:06.335
Darius, don't make a move!

01:33:06.418 --> 01:33:08.212
<i>- What?
- It's all fucked up!</i>

01:33:08.295 --> 01:33:10.297
Do not make a move! Keep your men back!

01:33:10.381 --> 01:33:11.799
What are you talking about?

01:33:11.882 --> 01:33:13.551
They heard everything we said in the M.C.C.

01:33:13.634 --> 01:33:15.719
<i>- What?
- Stand down! Stand down!</i>

01:33:15.803 --> 01:33:19.140
The drawer with the demands in it!
They heard everything we said!

01:33:19.223 --> 01:33:21.559
They put a transmitter in it!
They bugged us!

01:33:21.642 --> 01:33:23.561
<i>No, no, no. I'm going in.</i>

01:33:25.146 --> 01:33:26.230
Shit.

01:33:34.405 --> 01:33:35.906
Get everyone together.

01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:38.409
Steve! Steve-O!

01:33:41.412 --> 01:33:42.872
They're coming in.

01:33:42.997 --> 01:33:44.790
- Everybody good?
- Yeah.

01:33:44.874 --> 01:33:46.917
All right! Everybody out!

01:33:47.001 --> 01:33:49.795
- Put your masks on!
- Everyone out! Out!

01:33:51.130 --> 01:33:52.214
- Go now!
- Go!

01:33:52.298 --> 01:33:54.592
Go! Go! Go!

01:33:55.885 --> 01:33:57.595
Now!
Get the fuck out!

01:33:57.928 --> 01:33:59.054
Move!

01:33:59.138 --> 01:34:02.266
Everybody up the fucking stairs!
Move!

01:34:12.276 --> 01:34:13.444
Move!

01:34:41.764 --> 01:34:43.390
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

01:34:43.474 --> 01:34:46.352
- Get down! Get down on the ground!
- Don't shoot!

01:34:50.523 --> 01:34:51.690
Cease fire!

01:34:52.483 --> 01:34:54.193
Cease fire! Cease fire!

01:34:55.653 --> 01:34:57.696
Cease fire! Cease fire!

01:35:00.491 --> 01:35:01.951
Let's go, people.

01:35:18.717 --> 01:35:20.553
Put your hands on your head!
Get down!

01:35:20.636 --> 01:35:21.971
Put your hands on your head.

01:35:22.054 --> 01:35:24.181
- Will somebody stop him?
- Get down!

01:35:24.265 --> 01:35:26.016
Put your hands on your head.

01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:28.102
- Put your hands on your head.
- Get them down!

01:35:28.185 --> 01:35:31.063
- On the ground!
- Put your hands on your fucking heads!

01:35:31.147 --> 01:35:32.690
Do not move!

01:35:32.773 --> 01:35:36.861
- Get down, put your hands on your head!
- Put the cuffs on them! Let's go!

01:35:39.738 --> 01:35:41.198
What's going on?

01:35:47.037 --> 01:35:48.706
Don't take any chances!

01:35:51.167 --> 01:35:53.752
It wasn't me! I'm not a criminal!

01:35:54.712 --> 01:35:55.880
Cuffs!

01:35:58.591 --> 01:35:59.717
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:01.719
- Don't move!
- I'm not moving!

01:36:08.309 --> 01:36:10.478
- Don't move!
- Do not move!

01:36:10.561 --> 01:36:13.439
Check them. Make sure they ain't got
no weapons on them and shit.

01:36:13.522 --> 01:36:15.232
Hernandez!
Right here.

01:36:17.735 --> 01:36:19.820
E.S.U. Team, line up!

01:36:30.873 --> 01:36:32.750
Door to the left, door to the left.

01:36:32.833 --> 01:36:35.127
- Clear on the right.
- Clear!

01:36:37.713 --> 01:36:39.632
- Left side clear.
- Clear!

01:36:41.717 --> 01:36:43.928
- Clear.
- Clear.

01:36:44.011 --> 01:36:46.388
- All clear!
Check under the desk.

01:36:47.097 --> 01:36:49.850
- Clear.
- Checking the office. All clear, Sarge.

01:36:51.060 --> 01:36:52.603
- Clear.
- Clear.

01:36:52.686 --> 01:36:53.896
Clear.

01:36:54.855 --> 01:36:55.940
Clear.

01:36:56.023 --> 01:36:57.566
All clear, Sarge.

01:37:01.111 --> 01:37:03.781
All clear. E.S.U. On the stairs.
Line it up!

01:37:11.455 --> 01:37:14.083
Let's go, guys.
Team in, team in. Let's go.

01:37:19.463 --> 01:37:20.589
Clear!

01:37:21.048 --> 01:37:22.258
- Clear.
- Clear.

01:37:24.718 --> 01:37:26.637
- Clear.
- Clear.

01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:27.888
Clear.

01:37:28.472 --> 01:37:30.307
- Clear, Sarge.
- Clear.

01:37:31.016 --> 01:37:33.561
Give me a bunker up here.
I need a bunker up front.

01:37:33.644 --> 01:37:35.354
Bringing the bunker up.

01:37:35.437 --> 01:37:36.647
Clear, Sarge.

01:37:38.107 --> 01:37:39.233
Clear.

01:37:39.984 --> 01:37:42.945
- We're almost clear down here.
- Make sure you're sure.

01:37:43.028 --> 01:37:44.697
<i>- I'll keep looking.
- Stay on it.</i>

01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:46.157
Roger that.

01:37:46.866 --> 01:37:48.868
Ready? Let's go.

01:37:52.538 --> 01:37:54.165
This is the last door.

01:38:01.505 --> 01:38:03.924
- Clear, Sarge!
- Come on down.

01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:12.975
Did you find a dead hostage?
- Negative.

01:38:13.058 --> 01:38:14.977
If it ain't here,
you must've missed something.

01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:17.855
Maybe, but I'm pretty sure we're
the only ones moving around down here.

01:38:17.938 --> 01:38:20.774
Check this out. They forgot to rob the joint.

01:38:20.858 --> 01:38:23.360
Holy shit.
And you didn't find anybody?

01:38:23.444 --> 01:38:25.654
We're still looking,
but there are no bad guys,

01:38:25.738 --> 01:38:27.865
no booby traps, no tunnels, no damage.

01:38:27.948 --> 01:38:29.366
- And nothing missing.
- Great, great, great.

01:38:29.450 --> 01:38:32.369
We'll put out a city-wide description
for David fucking Copperfield, then, huh?

01:38:32.453 --> 01:38:34.455
Listen, I'm not trying to tell you
your jobs, Detectives,

01:38:34.538 --> 01:38:36.540
but unless they swam out
through the toilets,

01:38:36.624 --> 01:38:38.459
whoever did this
is upstairs sucking pavement.

01:38:38.542 --> 01:38:39.835
All right, good job.

01:38:39.919 --> 01:38:41.086
What's that?

01:38:43.798 --> 01:38:44.965
Cell phones.

01:38:46.050 --> 01:38:48.969
- Hey, guys! You need to see this.
- Okay.

01:38:49.303 --> 01:38:53.307
Collins! Grab a uniform, make a quick count
of that money in there, all right?

01:38:53.390 --> 01:38:55.226
- Yes, sir.
- And stand by, all right?

01:38:55.309 --> 01:38:57.228
Don't let anybody get tempted,
including you!

01:38:57.311 --> 01:38:58.395
Yes, sir!

01:38:58.938 --> 01:39:00.564
Right here, Detective.

01:39:00.648 --> 01:39:04.235
- What do you got?
- You're going to love this one. Toy guns.

01:39:04.318 --> 01:39:06.487
Fake guns. You got to be kidding me.

01:39:07.530 --> 01:39:10.241
- Toys.
- As if it wasn't weird enough already.

01:39:10.366 --> 01:39:12.535
<i>Cap,
come to the ladies' room.</i>

01:39:13.077 --> 01:39:14.453
On my way.

01:39:32.429 --> 01:39:33.639
Check it out.

01:39:34.765 --> 01:39:36.809
We can stop looking for that body.

01:39:37.351 --> 01:39:38.602
Fake guns.

01:39:39.603 --> 01:39:41.188
Fake execution.

01:39:42.314 --> 01:39:44.483
Nobody goes home
till we get everybody's story.

01:39:44.567 --> 01:39:47.278
Cap, we got something else
in the storage room.

01:39:59.123 --> 01:40:00.791
- Porcario?
- Yo.

01:40:01.333 --> 01:40:04.503
- Where's the men's room?
- Down the hallway on the left.

01:40:14.805 --> 01:40:17.475
Pick them up, pick them up. Toss them.

01:40:17.558 --> 01:40:19.685
I'm a hostage.
Stop pushing.

01:40:43.167 --> 01:40:47.254
Female hostages to be searched
by female officers only!

01:40:48.214 --> 01:40:50.424
All right, listen,
let's get these people up.

01:40:50.508 --> 01:40:52.676
- I can't hear you. What?
- Valerie Keepsake.

01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:54.678
Valerie Keepsake. Go, go, get on the bus.

01:40:54.762 --> 01:40:56.472
- Kenneth Damerjian.
- Yeah.

01:40:56.555 --> 01:40:57.848
Person one.

01:40:57.932 --> 01:41:00.643
- I'm Peter Hammond.
- Eric Dodge.

01:41:00.726 --> 01:41:03.646
- Wait!
- Chaim. My name's Chaim.

01:41:05.397 --> 01:41:07.149
Fucking cocksucker.

01:41:07.817 --> 01:41:09.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:41:09.443 --> 01:41:11.570
Just give me your name.
Just give me your name.

01:41:11.654 --> 01:41:13.447
Say your name.

01:41:14.323 --> 01:41:16.242
I work in the bank!

01:41:16.492 --> 01:41:19.036
I'm the bank security guard!
Nobody's listening!

01:41:19.119 --> 01:41:20.412
Okay, we'll straighten it out.

01:41:20.496 --> 01:41:22.164
Everybody's saying listen!
Nobody's listening!

01:41:22.248 --> 01:41:23.624
We'll straighten it out. Come on.

01:41:23.707 --> 01:41:25.709
- Listen, I'm not getting on the bus!
- Yes, you are.

01:41:25.793 --> 01:41:28.170
Move! Move! Move!
- I am not! I work at the bank!

01:41:28.254 --> 01:41:29.713
Collins, you got this?

01:41:29.797 --> 01:41:31.215
Listen, I work at the bank!

01:41:31.298 --> 01:41:33.425
All right, just get him on the bus.
Get him on the bus.

01:41:33.509 --> 01:41:36.887
- Nobody's listening!
- All right. Calm down. Get on the bus.

01:41:50.401 --> 01:41:52.570
Come on, guys, guys!
Over this way. Over this way.

01:41:52.653 --> 01:41:55.197
Officer, take her over to Sarge. Come on.

01:41:55.447 --> 01:41:58.784
Come on, let's get going
with these people off that line over there.

01:41:58.868 --> 01:42:00.119
Come on.

01:42:06.834 --> 01:42:10.463
Captain, I'm telling you,
this thing is a mess.

01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:13.549
They thought this one out, soup to nuts.

01:42:13.632 --> 01:42:15.176
So, lay it out for me.

01:42:15.843 --> 01:42:18.429
We photograph everybody
that came out of the bank.

01:42:18.512 --> 01:42:21.348
We sit them down, we question them,
we show them the photos.

01:42:21.432 --> 01:42:24.977
Most of them can't point to anybody
that's guilty of anything.

01:42:25.644 --> 01:42:29.106
We ask them if they could recognise
anybody who was not one of the bad guys.

01:42:29.190 --> 01:42:31.817
Even if we considered someone
as a possible suspect,

01:42:31.942 --> 01:42:34.653
there's one or two or three other people
that would rule them out.

01:42:34.737 --> 01:42:36.113
It's like the thing never happened.

01:42:36.197 --> 01:42:38.991
- What about prints?
- Everywhere. So what?

01:42:39.867 --> 01:42:43.412
- All it shows is that these people were there.
- Alibis?

01:42:43.496 --> 01:42:44.830
Just about everyone.

01:42:44.914 --> 01:42:46.791
Even if their alibi was weak,

01:42:46.874 --> 01:42:49.960
a hostage would identify them
as being one of the good guys.

01:42:50.044 --> 01:42:51.587
There we are, back to square one.

01:42:51.670 --> 01:42:52.755
Priors?

01:42:52.838 --> 01:42:56.258
We got one employee who had
some juvie stuff. One customer had...

01:42:56.342 --> 01:42:57.468
Excuse me.

01:42:58.177 --> 01:43:00.846
One customer had an out-of-state warrant
for child support.

01:43:00.930 --> 01:43:03.849
Another one had a couple of priors,
G.L.A. mostly.

01:43:04.683 --> 01:43:07.645
Again, same problem.
Plus, he was a fucking idiot.

01:43:07.728 --> 01:43:09.772
- Bank cameras?
- Useless.

01:43:09.855 --> 01:43:12.274
I'm telling you,
they thought of everything. Almost.

01:43:12.358 --> 01:43:14.652
- Sounded like everything to me.
- But this.

01:43:14.735 --> 01:43:17.988
We haven't found that. 357
or the perp that was holding it.

01:43:18.072 --> 01:43:20.783
If you did, there'd be no prints on it anyway.

01:43:21.575 --> 01:43:23.118
- Bury it.
- Bury it?

01:43:23.327 --> 01:43:25.663
What the fuck do you expect me to say?

01:43:29.667 --> 01:43:33.087
Captain, this thing stinks to high hell.
I mean, somebody did something here.

01:43:33.170 --> 01:43:34.713
You said it yourself.

01:43:34.797 --> 01:43:37.383
You got no robbery. No suspects.

01:43:37.925 --> 01:43:40.261
Nobody's breathing down my neck
to come up with answers.

01:43:40.344 --> 01:43:42.930
I'm not gonna breathe down yours. Bury it.

01:43:46.392 --> 01:43:48.227
I wasn't expecting this.

01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:51.355
I promise you,
I'll find you guys more cases to solve.

01:43:53.858 --> 01:43:54.942
Okay.

01:43:56.694 --> 01:43:59.572
Oh, here's something
that you probably did expect.

01:43:59.655 --> 01:44:03.367
- They found that missing Madrugada money.
- No shit.

01:44:03.951 --> 01:44:06.162
Yes, you want to know where it was?

01:44:06.245 --> 01:44:08.414
- In my bank account?
- No.

01:44:08.497 --> 01:44:10.833
- My summer house in Sag Harbour?
- No.

01:44:10.916 --> 01:44:12.585
- My wallet?
- No.

01:44:13.502 --> 01:44:16.213
Then, no. I don't want to know.

01:44:24.054 --> 01:44:25.764
This is bullshit, man.

01:44:25.848 --> 01:44:28.100
I mean, we're the only ones left
trying to catch the bad guys

01:44:28.184 --> 01:44:29.852
and they're gonna come after us like that?

01:44:29.935 --> 01:44:31.937
I'll tell you what.
Every one of your accusers, man,

01:44:32.021 --> 01:44:35.441
I say we go after them all, Keith,
Michael Corleone style.

01:44:35.524 --> 01:44:37.568
"Michael Corleone,
do you renounce Satan?"

01:44:37.651 --> 01:44:39.236
"Yes, I renounce him. "

01:44:40.404 --> 01:44:42.448
There's no 392.

01:44:42.531 --> 01:44:45.493
- Huh?
- Safety deposit box number 392.

01:44:45.576 --> 01:44:47.828
According to these records, it doesn't exist.

01:44:47.912 --> 01:44:50.498
Pinstriped, mayonnaise, lying motherfucker.

01:44:50.664 --> 01:44:53.876
- Didn't Coughlin say we should move on?
- Let's go.

01:45:03.260 --> 01:45:05.596
Thank you, again, Your Honour.
I'll come pick it up tomorrow?

01:45:05.679 --> 01:45:07.765
- Yes, you're welcome.
- Thank you.

01:45:14.563 --> 01:45:16.065
What are you doing, Detective?

01:45:16.148 --> 01:45:18.692
Now, what business do you have
with Judge Pasqua?

01:45:18.776 --> 01:45:20.277
Police business.

01:45:20.361 --> 01:45:23.739
- Weren't you told to bury this?
- I got a job to do, Miss White.

01:45:23.823 --> 01:45:26.617
And since when is your job
more important than your career?

01:45:26.700 --> 01:45:29.119
- Or did you forget our arrangement?
- We didn't have any arrangement.

01:45:29.203 --> 01:45:30.621
Let me tell you how this works. You...

01:45:30.704 --> 01:45:32.748
No, let me tell you how this works.

01:45:32.832 --> 01:45:36.043
You press here to record
and you press here to play.

01:45:36.127 --> 01:45:38.462
<i>There's
also the matter of the $140,000</i>

01:45:38.546 --> 01:45:39.713
<i>that seems to have walked away</i>

01:45:39.797 --> 01:45:42.550
<i>from the Madrugada cheque-cashing bust.</i>

01:45:42.716 --> 01:45:44.969
<i>I didn't have anything
to do with that, so...</i>

01:45:45.052 --> 01:45:47.138
<i>We'd like to be
in your corner on that.</i>

01:45:47.221 --> 01:45:50.057
<i>In exchange for what? I mean, what,
do you want me to do something unethical?</i>

01:45:50.141 --> 01:45:52.101
<i>I mean, no disrespect to the both of youse</i>

01:45:52.184 --> 01:45:54.228
<i>but I don't need you
to be in my corner, Mr Mayor.</i>

01:45:54.311 --> 01:45:55.646
<i>Look, I'm innocent.</i>

01:45:55.729 --> 01:45:58.482
<i>Innocent or guilty,
you're still going down.</i>

01:45:59.316 --> 01:46:03.320
<i>Give Miss White whatever
she needs, or your career is over.</i>

01:46:03.779 --> 01:46:04.905
<i>Done.</i>

01:46:05.281 --> 01:46:06.490
<i>Kaput.</i>

01:46:07.992 --> 01:46:10.953
So? You gave me what I wanted.

01:46:11.036 --> 01:46:14.165
Your career is blossoming
and all is right with the world.

01:46:14.248 --> 01:46:15.749
What was Case hiding?

01:46:18.919 --> 01:46:22.381
You know, there's a famous saying
by the Baron de Rothschild.

01:46:24.133 --> 01:46:27.344
"When there's blood on the streets,
buy property. "

01:46:29.805 --> 01:46:32.850
I think Mr Case
really took that sentiment to heart.

01:46:32.933 --> 01:46:35.811
But he is no different
than half the Fortune 500.

01:46:37.188 --> 01:46:38.939
Let it go, Detective.

01:46:40.399 --> 01:46:42.026
You're a good cop.

01:46:42.776 --> 01:46:44.528
This city needs you.

01:47:12.681 --> 01:47:16.185
- Lady! Lady, you're in the wrong place.
- I have an appointment.

01:47:24.777 --> 01:47:25.986
Arthur.

01:47:26.779 --> 01:47:29.365
- Good morning.
- Miss White.

01:47:30.157 --> 01:47:31.492
Have a seat.

01:47:33.369 --> 01:47:36.205
Thank you, Vincent. That's all for now.
Thank you.

01:47:39.792 --> 01:47:42.002
Well. What did he say?

01:47:42.086 --> 01:47:45.089
Well, Detective Frazier
turned out to be quite sharp.

01:47:45.172 --> 01:47:48.342
But I just fast-tracked his career a little
and he's under control.

01:47:48.425 --> 01:47:51.387
I hope so. Tell me about the envelope.

01:47:51.804 --> 01:47:52.972
Where is it now?

01:47:53.055 --> 01:47:55.933
Well, the gang leader
is going to hang on to it,

01:47:56.016 --> 01:47:59.145
as an insurance policy
to keep you from seeking revenge.

01:47:59.812 --> 01:48:02.565
Clearly, he has a very low opinion of you.

01:48:02.648 --> 01:48:03.983
And what might that be?

01:48:04.066 --> 01:48:07.361
Well, let's see.
In a nutshell, that you got rich,

01:48:07.570 --> 01:48:10.656
doing business with the Nazis
during the Holocaust.

01:48:13.909 --> 01:48:15.035
Yes.

01:48:16.245 --> 01:48:19.331
It was 60 years ago.
I was young and ambitious.

01:48:19.957 --> 01:48:22.751
I saw a short path to success and I took it.

01:48:24.378 --> 01:48:25.921
I sold my soul.

01:48:27.673 --> 01:48:30.676
And I've been trying to buy it back
ever since.

01:48:30.759 --> 01:48:35.264
But you and this mystery man,
you have an understanding?

01:48:35.431 --> 01:48:39.268
I think so. And he managed
to get out of there with that envelope.

01:48:40.269 --> 01:48:43.606
If someday
he comes back to blackmail you, well,

01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:47.151
you'll pay him. And you'll get it back.

01:48:48.444 --> 01:48:50.488
- So, I guess that's it.
- I suppose so.

01:48:50.571 --> 01:48:52.448
- Bullshit.
- I beg your pardon?

01:48:52.531 --> 01:48:56.410
He didn't go through all that just to stick
your envelope under his mattress.

01:48:56.494 --> 01:48:59.288
Look, they left money untouched, Arthur.

01:48:59.371 --> 01:49:00.456
So?

01:49:00.581 --> 01:49:04.960
So, he had to have walked out of there
with something else.

01:49:05.961 --> 01:49:08.464
The bank says
that there was nothing missing.

01:49:08.547 --> 01:49:11.133
So, there had to have been
something in that box

01:49:11.217 --> 01:49:13.928
that was worth more to him
than your envelope.

01:49:15.805 --> 01:49:17.807
You don't have to tell me.

01:49:17.890 --> 01:49:20.476
There's only one thing it could be anyway.

01:49:23.646 --> 01:49:24.814
Diamonds.

01:49:25.773 --> 01:49:27.650
And then there's the ring.

01:49:28.317 --> 01:49:29.735
Cartier ring.

01:49:30.361 --> 01:49:33.322
It belonged to the wife of a Parisian banker.

01:49:33.739 --> 01:49:36.408
Wealthy family of French Jews.

01:49:37.076 --> 01:49:40.204
And when the war came along,
the ring and everything else they owned

01:49:40.287 --> 01:49:45.126
was confiscated and they were shipped off
to concentration camps. None survived.

01:49:47.128 --> 01:49:48.754
We were friends.

01:49:49.672 --> 01:49:51.465
I could have helped them.

01:49:53.384 --> 01:49:58.222
But the Nazis paid too well.

01:50:00.141 --> 01:50:04.728
Can I trust that you will keep
what you've learnt

01:50:04.812 --> 01:50:08.107
here today confidential?

01:50:09.191 --> 01:50:11.485
Despite whatever you may think?

01:50:20.578 --> 01:50:21.996
Yes, Arthur.

01:50:23.956 --> 01:50:27.126
Well, I'd love to tell you
what a monster you are,

01:50:27.334 --> 01:50:31.505
but I have to help bin Laden's nephew
buy a co-op on Park Avenue.

01:50:35.718 --> 01:50:38.179
If that were true, you wouldn't tell me.

01:50:38.471 --> 01:50:40.639
We're listing you as a reference.

01:50:55.112 --> 01:50:57.448
My name is Dalton Russell.

01:50:58.032 --> 01:50:59.867
Pay strict attention to what I say

01:50:59.950 --> 01:51:03.579
because I choose my words carefully
and I never repeat myself.

01:51:03.662 --> 01:51:06.373
<i>I've told you my name. That's the "who. "</i>

01:51:07.416 --> 01:51:11.086
<i>The "where" could most readily
be described as a prison cell.</i>

01:51:11.629 --> 01:51:13.214
But there is a vast difference

01:51:13.297 --> 01:51:16.801
between being stuck in a tiny cell
and being in prison.

01:51:18.511 --> 01:51:20.137
<i>The "what" is easy.</i>

01:51:21.138 --> 01:51:25.851
<i>Recently I planned and set in motion
events to execute the perfect bank robbery.</i>

01:51:26.894 --> 01:51:28.813
That's also the "when. "

01:51:29.814 --> 01:51:34.193
<i>As for the "why,"
beyond the obvious financial motivation,</i>

01:51:34.944 --> 01:51:36.695
<i>it's exceedingly simple.</i>

01:51:37.112 --> 01:51:38.531
<i>Because I can.</i>

01:51:39.657 --> 01:51:41.909
<i>Which leaves us only with the "how. "</i>

01:51:42.701 --> 01:51:45.746
<i>And therein, as the Bard would tell us,</i>

01:51:46.831 --> 01:51:48.290
<i>lies the rub.</i>

01:52:37.506 --> 01:52:41.093
He's gonna smell like shit.
What do you expect after a week?

01:52:43.471 --> 01:52:44.555
Yeah.

01:52:45.014 --> 01:52:47.475
Why do you think I rolled down the window?

01:53:07.161 --> 01:53:08.412
Oh, shit.

01:53:13.876 --> 01:53:16.420
That cop, Frazier, and his partner
are walking into the bank.

01:53:16.504 --> 01:53:19.799
<i>- Are they coming for me?
- Can't say. It's just the two of them.</i>

01:53:27.431 --> 01:53:30.434
Yeah, everything's going great today.
No.

01:53:30.768 --> 01:53:33.771
Yeah, about 5:30. Okay.

01:53:34.230 --> 01:53:36.774
Sounds like fun. Okay.

01:53:37.566 --> 01:53:39.109
Talk to you later.

01:54:00.506 --> 01:54:02.258
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

01:54:05.553 --> 01:54:06.971
Mr Hammond?

01:54:07.054 --> 01:54:08.806
Good morning, Detectives.

01:54:12.351 --> 01:54:13.936
Just like he planned.

01:54:14.019 --> 01:54:16.605
I got a court order here
to open a safe deposit box.

01:54:16.689 --> 01:54:18.607
Number 392.

01:54:29.827 --> 01:54:31.579
Oh, thank God.

01:54:37.334 --> 01:54:38.711
Where is it?

01:54:39.503 --> 01:54:40.963
I left it in there.

01:54:41.046 --> 01:54:42.715
This way, Detectives.

01:54:42.798 --> 01:54:45.384
Why did you do that? You left the ring.

01:54:45.468 --> 01:54:46.719
Trust me.

01:54:47.678 --> 01:54:49.346
I left it in good hands.

01:54:50.222 --> 01:54:51.849
<i>I'm no martyr.</i>

01:54:52.558 --> 01:54:54.268
<i>I did it for the money.</i>

01:54:55.978 --> 01:54:59.648
<i>But it's not worth much
if you can't face yourself in the mirror.</i>

01:55:00.441 --> 01:55:03.068
<i>Respect is the ultimate currency.</i>

01:55:05.905 --> 01:55:09.867
<i>I was stealing from a man
who traded his away for a few dollars.</i>

01:55:11.744 --> 01:55:14.246
<i>And then he tried to wash away his guilt.</i>

01:55:15.372 --> 01:55:19.418
<i>Drown it in a lifetime of good deeds
and a sea of respectability.</i>

01:55:20.211 --> 01:55:22.338
- Let me get that.
- Let me.

01:55:22.421 --> 01:55:23.798
<i>It almost worked, too.</i>

01:55:23.881 --> 01:55:25.007
Okay.

01:55:27.092 --> 01:55:28.469
<i>But inevitably,</i>

01:55:29.428 --> 01:55:31.597
<i>the further you run from your sins,</i>

01:55:32.431 --> 01:55:35.518
<i>the more exhausted you are
when they catch up to you.</i>

01:55:35.726 --> 01:55:36.894
<i>And they do.</i>

01:55:38.771 --> 01:55:40.314
Son of a bitch.

01:55:40.397 --> 01:55:41.607
<i>Certain.</i>

01:55:42.608 --> 01:55:44.276
<i>It will not fail.</i>

01:55:48.656 --> 01:55:50.658
What do you think that's worth?

01:55:50.950 --> 01:55:53.619
If you got to ask, man,
you can't afford it.

01:55:53.702 --> 01:55:56.080
Thank goodness my girlfriend ain't here.

01:55:58.207 --> 01:55:59.959
"Follow the ring"?

01:56:14.014 --> 01:56:16.976
- Detective Frazier.
- Mr Case.

01:56:17.143 --> 01:56:19.145
- How are you?
- I am great.

01:56:19.562 --> 01:56:22.982
Nobody got killed at the bank.
Everybody's happy. My kind of day.

01:56:23.065 --> 01:56:25.025
That's wonderful. Wonderful.

01:56:25.109 --> 01:56:26.819
- Detective Mitchell.
- Mr Case.

01:56:26.902 --> 01:56:28.863
- Be seated, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

01:56:28.946 --> 01:56:31.240
- Can I offer you anything?
- No.

01:56:31.323 --> 01:56:32.908
I must say

01:56:33.284 --> 01:56:35.703
I was most impressed

01:56:36.871 --> 01:56:38.789
by the way you handled that business.

01:56:38.873 --> 01:56:40.166
Thank you, Mr Case.

01:56:40.249 --> 01:56:42.168
Whenever I hear the term
"New York's Finest"

01:56:42.251 --> 01:56:44.003
you're who I think of.

01:56:44.086 --> 01:56:47.339
You keep the rest of us safe
and make it look easy.

01:56:49.633 --> 01:56:52.011
- Pardon me.
- Well, what's so amusing?

01:56:52.094 --> 01:56:55.014
When you say "the rest of us," Mr Case,
I mean, you got to look around.

01:56:55.097 --> 01:56:59.185
"The rest of us" is a category
that you haven't qualified for in a long time.

01:56:59.268 --> 01:57:01.979
Touché, Detective.
I won't deny it. I've done well.

01:57:02.062 --> 01:57:04.190
Yes, you have. But I'm very confused.

01:57:04.273 --> 01:57:06.025
You see, I got a case

01:57:06.775 --> 01:57:09.737
where armed robbers
laid siege to your bank.

01:57:09.820 --> 01:57:11.155
It is your bank, right?

01:57:11.238 --> 01:57:13.115
Well, I'm Chairman of the Board of Directors.

01:57:13.199 --> 01:57:14.867
Then ita-zita-vene-gazoo.

01:57:14.950 --> 01:57:16.869
The robbers disappear. Poof.

01:57:17.203 --> 01:57:18.621
And they don't take a nickel, right?

01:57:18.704 --> 01:57:21.040
- You're asking me?
- Yes, I'm asking you.

01:57:21.123 --> 01:57:23.292
I mean, it's your bank. You own it.
I'm asking you.

01:57:23.375 --> 01:57:25.252
It's a tiny part of our organisation.

01:57:25.336 --> 01:57:27.463
No robbers. No real victims.
No loot missing.

01:57:27.546 --> 01:57:29.632
It's got to be the first time
in law-enforcement history.

01:57:29.715 --> 01:57:30.883
I never heard of it before.

01:57:30.966 --> 01:57:34.011
So, you got to ask yourself, "What the fuck
happened?" Don't you, Mr Case?

01:57:34.094 --> 01:57:35.721
I'm not quite sure I like your tone, Officer.

01:57:35.805 --> 01:57:38.140
You don't like my tone?
Then give me a straight answer.

01:57:38.224 --> 01:57:42.061
It's the founding bank of your empire.
You built it. It's your baby.

01:57:42.144 --> 01:57:44.188
Give me a straight answer.
What do you think happened?

01:57:44.271 --> 01:57:47.900
- I have no idea.
- Oh, come on, now. Come on.

01:57:47.983 --> 01:57:49.401
I'll tell you what I think happened.

01:57:49.485 --> 01:57:51.612
I think you sent that woman in there
to patch things up.

01:57:51.695 --> 01:57:54.240
Miss White. I think you paid her.
What was she doing in there?

01:57:54.323 --> 01:57:55.783
Look, this is absurd.

01:57:55.866 --> 01:57:57.827
Are you implying that
I had anything to do with it?

01:57:57.910 --> 01:57:59.537
392.

01:58:00.079 --> 01:58:02.581
Safe deposit box 392.
What's the story on that?

01:58:02.665 --> 01:58:05.042
- I have no idea what you're...
- Don't lie to me, Mr Case.

01:58:05.126 --> 01:58:07.628
- I don't lie.
- I looked at all the records.

01:58:07.711 --> 01:58:11.257
All the bank records
for safe deposit boxes at your bank.

01:58:11.423 --> 01:58:14.135
At first glance, everything looked fine,

01:58:14.885 --> 01:58:17.221
but there was one safe deposit box
that had no records.

01:58:17.304 --> 01:58:19.265
I mean, going all the way back to 1948.

01:58:19.348 --> 01:58:22.476
So I started thinking.
Who would have the answer to this riddle?

01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:24.436
Probably the man who forgot to mention

01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:26.814
that he built the bank
in the first place in 1948.

01:58:26.897 --> 01:58:29.733
It doesn't add up, Mr Case.
It does not add up.

01:58:30.651 --> 01:58:34.989
I'm afraid I can't be
of any further use to you, Detective.

01:58:36.157 --> 01:58:38.659
It's something really bad, isn't it?

01:58:39.368 --> 01:58:43.998
Mr Frazier, I have spent
my whole life serving humanity.

01:58:45.458 --> 01:58:47.501
You can ask anyone who knows me.

01:58:48.794 --> 01:58:51.797
They'll vouch for me,
and for the things that I've done.

01:58:51.881 --> 01:58:54.925
You think they'll vouch for you
after I find out the truth about this ring?

01:58:55.009 --> 01:58:56.385
I don't think so.

01:59:01.056 --> 01:59:04.101
Oh, by the way, that thing you said
about us being New York's finest?

01:59:04.185 --> 01:59:06.896
I want you to know,
we really appreciate that.

01:59:07.438 --> 01:59:08.772
How gracious.

01:59:09.607 --> 01:59:12.276
Let's go. We're gonna follow that ring.

01:59:19.283 --> 01:59:21.869
- Hey, Keith, let me see your shoe.
- What?

01:59:21.952 --> 01:59:24.330
- Let me see your shoe.
- Why?

01:59:24.413 --> 01:59:28.459
'Cause I have never seen anybody
put their foot that far up a guy's ass.

01:59:30.544 --> 01:59:32.213
Yeah, I guess I did, didn't I?

01:59:32.296 --> 01:59:34.882
Oh, man. You cut him an ass
the length of the Lincoln Tunnel.

01:59:34.965 --> 01:59:37.635
We're gonna need a traffic cop on that shit.

01:59:46.227 --> 01:59:47.394
Good afternoon, sir.

01:59:47.478 --> 01:59:49.396
- Do you have a reservation?
- Looking for the Mayor.

01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:51.440
- May I have your hat, please?
- No, you cannot. Get your own.

01:59:51.524 --> 01:59:54.109
They're looking to invest
$4 billion over the next four years.

01:59:54.193 --> 01:59:55.319
And that's all in place.

01:59:55.402 --> 01:59:58.405
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Mayor,
but there's an old American saying,

01:59:58.489 --> 02:00:02.243
"When there's blood on the streets,
somebody's got to go to jail. "

02:00:02.910 --> 02:00:05.913
Edwin, could you please excuse us
for a minute?

02:00:07.998 --> 02:00:09.583
What's this about, Detective?

02:00:09.667 --> 02:00:13.212
I believe Detective Frazier
is looking for some closure?

02:00:13.546 --> 02:00:15.798
That's a good word. Closure.

02:00:15.881 --> 02:00:18.467
Case closed, you know what I mean?

02:00:18.551 --> 02:00:19.885
This is the number

02:00:19.969 --> 02:00:24.014
of the War Crimes Issues office
in Washington, D.C.

02:00:25.641 --> 02:00:28.269
<i>How'd you like to be on the front page
of the New York Times?</i>

02:00:28.352 --> 02:00:29.436
That'd be great.

02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:33.482
Make sure they spell my name right, though.
That's Frazier with a "z".

02:00:33.983 --> 02:00:35.526
You can keep the pen.

02:00:36.235 --> 02:00:37.736
You made copies?

02:00:39.321 --> 02:00:40.531
Please.

02:00:40.948 --> 02:00:44.368
We got to keep the real criminals
off the streets, Your Honour.

02:00:45.828 --> 02:00:48.497
All right, well, thanks for lunch.

02:00:52.877 --> 02:00:54.462
War crimes, huh?

02:00:55.254 --> 02:00:57.465
What have you got me into this time?

02:01:17.067 --> 02:01:18.152
Mama?

02:01:22.865 --> 02:01:25.618
- Did you bring Big Willie?
- And the twins.

02:01:39.256 --> 02:01:40.508
Slow down, girl.

02:01:40.591 --> 02:01:42.968
I'll get my gun off
before I get my gun off, okay?

02:01:43.052 --> 02:01:44.303
Pow, pow.

02:02:26.262 --> 02:02:27.972
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

02:02:28.722 --> 02:02:30.349
<i>Why don't you
just walk out the door?</i>

02:02:30.432 --> 02:02:31.517
<i>I will.</i>

02:02:31.767 --> 02:02:34.645
<i>I'm gonna walk out of that door
when I'm good and ready.</i>

02:02:34.728 --> 02:02:36.021
Son of a bitch.

02:02:43.404 --> 02:02:46.282
Come on, honey.
The handcuffs are getting cold.
