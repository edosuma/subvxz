WEBVTT

00:01.201 --> 00:03.703
In New York City's war on crime,

00:03.770 --> 00:06.080
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

00:06.139 --> 00:08.710
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.775 --> 00:10.448
These are their stories.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.889
Just 8 days more to go.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.854
I'm going crazy thinking about it.

00:18.485 --> 00:19.987
Me, too, sweetheart.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:28.495 --> 00:30.099
That's enough of that.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.103
You are so funny.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.245
He never wants to see me again?

00:35.302 --> 00:37.509
Your father's upset. You didn't
visit him while he was away.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.050
I had no access.

00:39.106 --> 00:40.517
She took me off the visitors list.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.383
Jack, you know I only do what Milt asks.

00:42.442 --> 00:44.786
Stop. Just stop.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.884
You should be ashamed of yourself.

00:51.618 --> 00:52.858
I'm sorry, Jack. He's...

00:52.920 --> 00:54.092
Don't worry.

00:54.888 --> 00:57.869
Milt wants to make sure
you get what's coming to you.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.900
Don't forget your brothers
behind the wall now.

01:02.963 --> 01:04.635
I'll keep it real.

01:04.697 --> 01:06.268
I'm gonna miss you, Milton.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.006
Same here, brother.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.172
Come here.

01:13.507 --> 01:14.986
Maybe your luck will change

01:15.042 --> 01:17.147
now that you don't have to play me.

01:25.485 --> 01:27.931
But who will make dinner for Mr. Milt?

01:27.988 --> 01:29.865
We'll figure something out.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.664
Tonight, I want him all to myself.

01:31.725 --> 01:34.501
Oh, I don't want to set off the
security system when he gets here.

01:34.561 --> 01:35.938
You want me to show you how?

01:35.996 --> 01:38.169
Uh, no. Just turn the stupid thing off.

01:38.231 --> 01:39.369
Okay.

01:41.001 --> 01:42.309
Look at this.

01:42.536 --> 01:45.608
Two years here turned me into a lean machine.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.683
So what's the first thing you're
gonna do when you get out?

01:50.377 --> 01:51.447
(PAMELA MOANING)

01:51.511 --> 01:52.717
Oh, Milt!

01:52.779 --> 01:54.156
Oh! You're the only one.

01:54.214 --> 01:55.852
My little sweetheart. The only

01:56.316 --> 01:57.420
one!

01:57.484 --> 01:58.895
(MOANING)

02:02.222 --> 02:03.667
Baby.

02:07.694 --> 02:09.571
Must be the little blue pills.

02:11.231 --> 02:13.074
It's like it has wings on it.

02:13.266 --> 02:14.438
Wings!

02:14.568 --> 02:15.842
(DOORBELL CHIMING)

02:15.902 --> 02:18.542
Oh! Must be dinner. I'm famished.

02:18.605 --> 02:21.745
I'll get it. You go take your shower.

02:33.086 --> 02:34.326
Pam?

02:40.160 --> 02:41.264
Pam!

02:41.695 --> 02:43.038
No!

02:43.130 --> 02:44.803
(WAILING)

02:45.999 --> 02:47.501
Those bastards!

02:48.268 --> 02:50.407
You bastards!

03:38.852 --> 03:40.126
These entry wounds,

03:40.187 --> 03:43.760
chest, shoulder, knee.

03:44.257 --> 03:46.737
The shooter had no control

03:46.927 --> 03:49.601
and couldn't resist ripping her earring off.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.505
Like some subway punk.

03:51.631 --> 03:54.009
He sprayed the doorway in an arc,

03:54.334 --> 03:56.371
even hit the upper window.

04:00.273 --> 04:03.686
You know, the shots came from down below,

04:05.145 --> 04:07.318
but not at the bottom of the stairs.

04:08.815 --> 04:10.624
Check the service entrance.

04:12.519 --> 04:17.661
Well, I got 5, 6, 7, 9mm casings.

04:19.326 --> 04:21.430
He rang the doorbell up there

04:21.661 --> 04:23.538
and ran down here to hide?

04:24.898 --> 04:27.037
No. He rang the doorbell down here.

04:28.034 --> 04:30.844
He thought the service
entrance was the main door.

04:31.638 --> 04:32.708
Here.

04:33.774 --> 04:38.416
She answers the door. He's surprised.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.289
He shoots wild,

04:42.616 --> 04:45.426
probably one-handed,

04:45.819 --> 04:47.093
cocked to one side.

04:47.154 --> 04:48.599
Like in the gangster flicks.

04:48.655 --> 04:50.566
He's not used to the recoil.

04:51.758 --> 04:53.704
He loses control of the piece.

04:56.263 --> 04:57.742
She'd ordered dinner.

04:57.798 --> 05:01.473
The security cameras must have been off,

05:01.535 --> 05:04.414
so she had to go to the door
to see who was there.

05:04.538 --> 05:05.676
Why were they off?

05:05.739 --> 05:08.310
The security system's very sophisticated.

05:08.375 --> 05:09.979
My wife, less so.

05:10.410 --> 05:11.514
(SIGHING)

05:11.578 --> 05:14.457
She must have turned it off
when she sent the maid home.

05:14.514 --> 05:17.688
Well, let's talk about who might
have wanted your wife dead.

05:17.751 --> 05:18.991
Any candidates?

05:19.052 --> 05:21.032
Nobody. She was an angel.

05:21.087 --> 05:25.126
We had just finished making
beautiful love. They were after me.

05:25.458 --> 05:27.165
All due respect,

05:27.394 --> 05:31.035
even in a snowstorm, no one
would mistake her for you.

05:31.131 --> 05:34.078
You think that's funny?
I have enemies everywhere.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.942
Like your ex-business partner.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.915
You were convicted of hiring
a hit man to kill him.

05:41.074 --> 05:43.213
Do I look incompetent? Hmm?

05:43.944 --> 05:47.153
If I wanted him dead, he would have been dead.

05:50.150 --> 05:53.131
Your conviction was a
frame-up, by your enemies.

05:53.687 --> 05:54.927
Exactly.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.360
My competitors.

05:56.423 --> 05:58.164
In the clothing business?

05:59.793 --> 06:02.797
This "Winter Clothes For All Seasons."

06:02.863 --> 06:04.843
This is the original store.

06:04.898 --> 06:08.471
Yeah, up in Harlem. That's my
dad on the left, and that's me.

06:10.403 --> 06:13.782
Who's the man whose knee you're sitting on?

06:14.040 --> 06:15.212
Our tailor.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.614
Morris Swope.

06:21.748 --> 06:23.091
Long gone.

06:24.951 --> 06:27.261
So you built the chain from one store.

06:27.320 --> 06:32.531
And the bastards came after me
because I refused to be undersold!

06:36.263 --> 06:39.073
Chang. Chang! Nitro.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.743
(MILTON PANTING)

06:45.038 --> 06:46.881
Worried about being poisoned?

06:47.340 --> 06:49.149
Can't be too safe.

06:54.014 --> 06:57.621
Great wealth meets great paranoia.
Not a healthy combination.

06:57.717 --> 06:59.719
Pierre's, the restaurant
Milt said they ordered from,

06:59.786 --> 07:01.493
had no record of any order.

07:01.688 --> 07:03.599
He told his wife he ordered dinner.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.694
That's why she opened the door.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.899
And knowing what was coming,
made beautiful love to her.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.236
Well, that's what made it
more exciting for him.

07:11.298 --> 07:13.278
Going by his trial testimony,

07:13.667 --> 07:16.273
the man's all about suspicion and revenge.

07:16.336 --> 07:17.440
Revenge for what?

07:17.504 --> 07:19.074
Don't tell me the lovely Mrs. Winters

07:19.139 --> 07:21.176
was cheating on the old coot
while he was still in prison.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.585
Apparently not, if you
believe the cook, the maid,

07:23.643 --> 07:26.055
the driver, and the Pilates instructor.

07:26.112 --> 07:29.616
Milt loved Pam. Pam loved Milt.
Everything was hunky-dory.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.889
Well, there might be one Winters
who's not closing ranks.

07:33.753 --> 07:35.198
Milton Junior.

07:35.722 --> 07:38.965
He was called as a character
witness at his father's trial,

07:39.426 --> 07:41.030
but he never showed up.

07:42.429 --> 07:45.376
My mother taught me if you can't
say anything nice about someone...

07:45.432 --> 07:47.139
So you skipped your dad's trial.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.339
And the reason you didn't visit him in jail?

07:49.402 --> 07:52.281
Pamela had him take my name
off the visitors list.

07:52.839 --> 07:54.910
She had him wrapped around her little finger.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.784
I won't say she had it coming, but...

07:56.843 --> 07:59.016
You know, usually, in a murder investigation,

07:59.079 --> 08:02.026
people try to hide their
joy at the victim's death.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.527
I'll try to remember that.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.221
You're an only child, right?

08:05.285 --> 08:06.355
Yeah.

08:06.419 --> 08:11.300
Well, with his wife out of the
way, you stand to inherit.

08:12.392 --> 08:15.498
Dad made a point of cutting
me out of his will years ago,

08:15.562 --> 08:17.769
so I wouldn't be tempted to kill him.

08:18.531 --> 08:19.601
(SNICKERING)

08:19.666 --> 08:22.670
That's my dad, always looking out for me.

08:24.304 --> 08:28.616
Well, at least you've learned not to
take his peculiarities personally.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.712
How can I? Dad's sick.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.251
A brilliant businessman, but sick.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.120
So he would've protected himself from Pamela.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.217
Well, I'm sure.

08:37.283 --> 08:38.523
With a pre-nup?

08:38.585 --> 08:39.756
Pre-nups, plural.

08:39.818 --> 08:42.857
I heard he was having his
lawyer redraft the originals.

08:43.923 --> 08:47.496
Well, assuming Pamela would
go along with a new pre-nup.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.898
Gee, suppose she said no.

08:54.267 --> 08:58.409
I don't care how many subpoenas
you pull out of your ass,

08:58.538 --> 09:01.712
you have no right to stick your
nose in my legal business.

09:01.775 --> 09:05.222
That's the point of getting a
subpoena, to give us that right.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.120
The material you're after is covered
by attorney-client privilege.

09:08.181 --> 09:12.220
That privilege was waived when you discussed
redrafting the pre-nup with Mrs. Winters.

09:12.285 --> 09:13.992
Who said anything about redrafting?

09:14.054 --> 09:15.158
EAMES: Your son.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.359
What?

09:18.058 --> 09:19.230
That rat.

09:20.193 --> 09:24.039
He talks to you, and he doesn't
talk to me? I can't believe this.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.873
Look, if you're gonna get upset,

09:27.700 --> 09:29.907
why don't you just wait outside,

09:31.271 --> 09:33.444
and we all talk to your lawyer.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.847
I see what you're doing.

09:36.076 --> 09:40.786
You people will do anything, say
anything to pin this on me.

09:41.214 --> 09:45.390
The worst scum in the pen have
more honor than any of you.

09:47.687 --> 09:49.064
I loved my wife.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.227
I loved her.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.828
CARVER: You loved her so much,
you were drafting a new pre-nup.

09:53.893 --> 09:56.999
A pre-nup that increased
her stake in his estate

09:57.063 --> 09:59.873
as reward for her fidelity
during his prison stay.

10:00.700 --> 10:03.909
Not that Pamela cared. Money
was the least of her concerns.

10:03.970 --> 10:06.780
What? It was your idea
to give your money away?

10:08.675 --> 10:12.248
I mean, guys with your
pathology, they usually

10:12.812 --> 10:15.588
build an armor around what they have.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.092
I'm not taking this bait.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.891
I'm not afraid of you.

10:23.356 --> 10:26.462
I'm not afraid of this whole
machinery of justice.

10:27.393 --> 10:28.565
I'm not.

10:30.897 --> 10:32.968
MILTON: "Money was the least of her concerns."

10:33.032 --> 10:36.741
Very nice. I almost believed you myself.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.441
I meant every word of it, Milton.

10:38.505 --> 10:40.644
Pam turned out to be a lovely girl.

10:41.241 --> 10:42.686
"A lovely girl."

10:43.743 --> 10:45.120
You should know.

10:46.246 --> 10:47.987
What are you saying, Milt?

10:50.183 --> 10:53.130
I know what you did, you son of a bitch.

10:54.554 --> 10:55.897
Milt, let... Let go.

10:55.955 --> 10:57.457
I know what you did.

10:59.325 --> 11:02.033
This pre-nup does speak toward his goodwill.

11:02.328 --> 11:03.466
(GUN FIRING)

11:03.530 --> 11:05.203
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

11:07.467 --> 11:09.140
Who's doing this to me?

11:10.537 --> 11:11.709
He's dead.

11:12.906 --> 11:17.048
Oh, my God. Who's doing this to me?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

11:23.650 --> 11:25.220
9mm casings.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.128
Looks like we got a bold
shooter on our hands.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.394
A bold shooter on a bicycle,
according to the limo driver,

11:29.455 --> 11:31.492
who unfortunately didn't see his face.

11:31.558 --> 11:32.628
Bastards!

11:32.692 --> 11:34.933
The bastards are striking at everyone I love,

11:34.994 --> 11:36.564
and you're doing nothing to stop them.

11:36.629 --> 11:37.733
Them?

11:37.797 --> 11:40.744
My enemies, you idiot. I'm the target.

11:41.734 --> 11:44.647
You know, it looks like he's the
one that took all the bullets.

11:44.704 --> 11:48.208
Jack Duvall was only important
because of his relationship to me.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.046
I'm going home. Rashid!

11:50.143 --> 11:53.283
How did he ever get the
impression people don't like him?

11:53.947 --> 11:55.688
EAMES: Duvall's files were off-limits.

11:55.748 --> 11:58.820
Even his lunch orders fell under
attorney-client privilege.

11:58.885 --> 12:01.695
Yeah. Luckily, the privilege doesn't
extend to his bank records.

12:01.754 --> 12:03.199
All we got out of the secretary

12:03.256 --> 12:05.258
is that Milt was Duvall's only client.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.430
What about Duvall and Mrs. Winters?

12:07.927 --> 12:09.804
Secretary have anything to say about them?

12:09.862 --> 12:12.968
Just that Duvall always
kept his office door open

12:13.032 --> 12:14.943
whenever Ms. Winters came in to see him

12:15.001 --> 12:17.413
and that he never gave her his private number.

12:17.470 --> 12:20.246
Well, Duvall knew how crazy Milt is.

12:24.711 --> 12:25.951
Look at this.

12:29.115 --> 12:33.154
Over the last few months,
Duvall issued a dozen checks

12:33.219 --> 12:37.531
from his escrow accounts, all for under
$10,000, all to small businesses.

12:37.624 --> 12:39.900
For losses from fire damages, accidents.

12:39.959 --> 12:41.461
He was helping settle insurance claims.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.871
GOREN: A travel agency in Mott Haven.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.410
A beauty salon in Morrisania.

12:47.233 --> 12:49.543
They're all in the South Bronx.

12:49.902 --> 12:54.112
Where a lot of kids learn how to
shoot from watching gangster flicks.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.018
GOREN: Have you ever seen this guy?

13:00.079 --> 13:01.615
He's a lawyer, Jack Duvall.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.957
No, I don't have much use for lawyers.

13:04.917 --> 13:06.897
Well, this lawyer

13:06.953 --> 13:11.333
wrote a $9,000 check to JC's Beauty Spa.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.766
And that's you, isn't it?

13:14.394 --> 13:15.702
I'm Solomon.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.669
JC is my wife Jaqueetha.

13:18.264 --> 13:19.470
It's her place.

13:19.532 --> 13:22.638
She had a gypsy cab, dollar
van accident a while back.

13:22.735 --> 13:23.873
It could be for that.

13:23.936 --> 13:25.779
Why don't we ask Jaqueetha?

13:26.072 --> 13:28.279
I want you to soak your hand in this.

13:30.576 --> 13:32.055
Is that what it was for?

13:32.111 --> 13:34.284
A gypsy cab accident a while back?

13:35.214 --> 13:38.218
I whiplashed my neck. That's what it was for.

13:38.284 --> 13:40.161
Those guys are crazy drivers.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.122
You're lucky they had insurance.

13:44.857 --> 13:46.234
Is this your son?

13:47.026 --> 13:49.028
Uh-huh. My boy.

13:50.963 --> 13:52.670
And there he is again.

13:53.232 --> 13:55.803
He must be, what, 14 in that picture?

13:56.703 --> 13:58.080
He's grown a lot.

13:58.304 --> 14:00.875
You must be what, 16?

14:02.642 --> 14:03.848
19.

14:04.043 --> 14:08.014
Taye, why don't you go
upstairs, do your studies.

14:18.958 --> 14:21.063
We'll let you get back to business.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.033
I recognized her first.

14:26.099 --> 14:29.478
She testified at the trial of
the boy's real father in '87.

14:29.535 --> 14:32.015
Dempsey Powers. You would've been in Germany.

14:32.071 --> 14:34.881
I remember hearing about him,
the South Bronx Drug King.

14:34.941 --> 14:36.477
He had an interesting MO.

14:36.542 --> 14:40.388
He used to shoot his victims straight
down through the top of their head

14:40.446 --> 14:43.757
to destroy the slug so it couldn't
be traced back to his gun.

14:43.850 --> 14:46.126
When they came to arrest
him, he shot his way out.

14:46.185 --> 14:49.997
Wounded 9 cops. My dad spent
the summer visiting hospitals.

14:50.923 --> 14:52.925
But that isn't why he's in jail, is it?

14:52.992 --> 14:54.767
No, he claimed self-defense.

14:54.827 --> 14:57.933
Told the jury the cops were
in the drug business with him

14:57.997 --> 14:59.442
and were out to kill him.

14:59.499 --> 15:02.878
They bought it. He's in jail for
killing 3 dope dealers.

15:04.771 --> 15:09.914
And now the mother of his kid is getting
money from Milt Winters' lawyer.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.780
You know, it's funny.

15:13.880 --> 15:17.418
Two guys who think that
the world is after them

15:18.117 --> 15:19.494
found each other.

15:24.190 --> 15:26.431
POWERS: Hey look, I was real
kind to that old white man.

15:26.492 --> 15:29.530
Gave him a cigarette once. Maybe
that's why he sent money to Jaqueetha.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.666
Yeah, $9,000 for a loosey?

15:31.864 --> 15:34.572
Hey, it's different
economics inside this wall.

15:35.034 --> 15:38.106
In fact, uh, what am I getting
for this little sit-down?

15:38.271 --> 15:42.651
Two extra phone calls a week for 6
months and an extra hour of TV a day.

15:42.708 --> 15:44.745
- Extra TV.
- Yeah.

15:44.811 --> 15:46.484
Living large, Dempsey.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.057
The point is, I'm still living,

15:48.114 --> 15:51.254
after all the bullets the
crooked NYPD threw at me.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.928
GOREN: Yeah, well, that was before our time.

15:53.986 --> 15:56.398
We were in the South Bronx.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.564
We just happened to drop your name.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.331
And I got to tell you,

16:00.793 --> 16:05.003
there's still all love for DP on the streets.

16:05.164 --> 16:06.472
I'm a legend.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.106
A living legend.

16:09.168 --> 16:13.207
In the South Bronx, but in here you're what,

16:15.041 --> 16:16.418
a guardian angel?

16:17.076 --> 16:19.283
Is that why Milt Winters had his lawyer

16:19.345 --> 16:24.226
send over $200 grand to businesses
that belong to your family

16:24.817 --> 16:26.125
and friends?

16:26.185 --> 16:28.791
Maybe it was reparations for the slave trade.

16:29.722 --> 16:33.465
First week Milt was here, some
guy tried to shake him down.

16:33.526 --> 16:36.268
That guy ended up with a
screwdriver in his neck.

16:36.362 --> 16:37.807
Milt was never bothered again.

16:37.864 --> 16:40.504
Milt carried himself like a man,
so he was treated like one.

16:40.566 --> 16:42.842
Especially with you watching his back.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.980
He ever talk to you about his wife?

16:51.844 --> 16:53.881
I would never turn on my friends.

16:54.213 --> 16:55.692
I'm not the NYPD.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.091
This punk's a waste of time.

16:57.149 --> 16:58.992
Yeah, but we're just talking.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.928
You know, we noticed that
your son's only been up here

17:02.989 --> 17:04.662
4 times in 16 years.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.563
Greenhaven's too far.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.471
Yeah? Help us out with Milt.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.332
Maybe we can talk to the DA.

17:12.397 --> 17:15.140
Move you someplace closer
where your son can visit.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.374
Come on, Dempsey. What do you think?

17:17.737 --> 17:20.047
You know what, I'm going to watch some TV.

17:20.106 --> 17:22.347
Oh. So you're gonna... You're gonna pass up

17:22.407 --> 17:26.015
seeing your son to protect
some rich white man.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.260
Wow! You know,

17:29.582 --> 17:31.823
I think you should sit down,
make yourself comfortable.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.057
I think we're gonna search your cell.

17:37.490 --> 17:38.833
You know what?

17:39.525 --> 17:41.368
You can search all you want.

17:42.028 --> 17:44.599
You can plant all the phony evidence you want.

17:46.032 --> 17:47.636
I ain't afraid of you.

17:48.834 --> 17:50.142
You got that?

17:52.572 --> 17:53.846
I ain't afraid.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.879
We found this inside the mattress.

18:01.247 --> 18:02.954
It's probably marked.

18:03.783 --> 18:06.821
Cards, girlie magazines.

18:07.053 --> 18:11.559
Dempsey Powers' entire world, and kids in
the projects think he's a living legend.

18:11.657 --> 18:13.330
This isn't much worse than what they have.

18:13.392 --> 18:15.531
Except he gets 3 squares a day.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.310
He's short 4 cards.

18:33.312 --> 18:34.723
Queen of diamonds.

18:36.882 --> 18:38.156
Jack of clubs.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.030
Deuce of spades.

18:45.524 --> 18:46.696
Ace, hearts.

18:49.996 --> 18:51.976
Queen of diamonds, Milt's wife.

18:53.432 --> 18:54.706
Jack of clubs,

18:56.102 --> 18:57.274
Jack Duvall.

18:57.336 --> 18:58.747
It's a hit list?

18:59.839 --> 19:01.648
Deuce of spades, Milt Junior.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.009
His own son?

19:03.075 --> 19:04.782
He's on a paranoid fugue.

19:05.277 --> 19:06.779
He's cleaning house.

19:06.912 --> 19:08.619
Like any good paranoiac,

19:08.748 --> 19:11.388
he wants to be there when his enemies go down.

19:12.551 --> 19:15.157
I don't know, Dad. You
call me out of the blue.

19:15.221 --> 19:18.498
I've had so much loss these
past two weeks. I need you, Son.

19:19.025 --> 19:20.595
I need you close to me now.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.697
Let me think about it, Dad. I got to go now.

19:22.762 --> 19:23.866
How about a ride uptown?

19:23.929 --> 19:26.239
No, it's okay. The water taxi
will get me there quicker.

19:26.298 --> 19:27.504
See you, Dad.

19:36.642 --> 19:37.677
Son!

20:01.867 --> 20:03.039
GOREN: Clear!

20:03.102 --> 20:04.274
I didn't believe them when they told me.

20:04.336 --> 20:05.940
- You bastard, how could you?
- MILTON: No!

20:06.005 --> 20:09.214
No, it's them. These cops are
trying to kill me. They're after me.

20:09.275 --> 20:10.345
For once, you're right.

20:10.409 --> 20:13.390
We are after you. Milton
Winters, you're under arrest.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.795
I told you, I'm a bike messenger.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.594
People are trying to jack me all the time.

20:22.655 --> 20:23.998
That's why I was carrying the piece.

20:24.056 --> 20:27.128
What about these? We found
them in your mom's apartment?

20:27.727 --> 20:29.638
Don't know nothing about them.

20:30.429 --> 20:32.238
You don't know what this is?

20:32.331 --> 20:34.038
Huh? How about this one?

20:35.167 --> 20:36.237
This one?

20:36.669 --> 20:37.773
They're playing cards?

20:37.837 --> 20:41.580
No, Ahmal, signals from Dempsey Powers.

20:41.941 --> 20:43.318
You see, some...

20:46.445 --> 20:49.392
Some rich white dude paid him $200 large

20:49.448 --> 20:51.894
to have you kill these people.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.488
You all are whack.

20:56.489 --> 20:57.797
And you're an amateur,

20:57.857 --> 21:01.031
'cause pros don't keep evidence
in their mama's apartment.

21:02.128 --> 21:03.971
I didn't do these homicides,

21:04.363 --> 21:06.775
but whoever did, he's no amateur.

21:07.199 --> 21:08.473
He's gangsta.

21:10.703 --> 21:11.909
Gangsta?

21:12.138 --> 21:16.450
No. This fool was too busy
styling to shoot straight.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.348
He punched out bullets

21:21.413 --> 21:22.448
(GUN COCKING)

21:22.515 --> 21:24.722
using a 90 degree flip.

21:25.584 --> 21:28.690
Or maybe the modified John Woo 180 cock.

21:29.188 --> 21:30.360
Whichever,

21:30.956 --> 21:32.526
he had no control.

21:32.992 --> 21:35.734
He put more bullets in the door
than he did in this woman.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.069
She looked dead in the picture.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.403
This isn't a movie.

21:38.464 --> 21:41.673
You did a murder in the course of
a robbery. That's a death penalty.

21:41.734 --> 21:42.872
I didn't rob nobody.

21:42.935 --> 21:45.006
You took an earring off the woman.

21:47.039 --> 21:50.509
GOREN: Didn't Dempsey tell you not
to mess with the bling-bling?

21:50.776 --> 21:53.552
I'm telling you, I don't even know DP.

21:54.513 --> 21:57.653
Your brother Luther spent time
with him up in Greenhaven.

21:59.685 --> 22:02.757
Is that how you met DP?

22:03.422 --> 22:05.834
Visiting your brother up in Greenhaven?

22:05.891 --> 22:07.598
How am I gonna get all the way up there?

22:07.660 --> 22:10.266
Subway only stop at 241st Street.

22:18.237 --> 22:20.740
All right, you don't have to flip on DP.

22:21.674 --> 22:22.982
Try this.

22:23.075 --> 22:24.884
You have these three cards.

22:25.244 --> 22:28.521
We know that there is a
fourth, the ace of hearts.

22:30.316 --> 22:31.522
Who is it?

22:33.118 --> 22:35.189
Who is the fourth hit?

22:36.455 --> 22:37.729
I got no ace.

22:38.457 --> 22:39.561
I'm done.

22:41.093 --> 22:42.470
Give me a lawyer.

22:43.929 --> 22:46.466
Even if this boy flips on Dempsey Powers,

22:46.532 --> 22:48.705
we have no corroboration

22:48.767 --> 22:52.044
other than generic playing
cards from a generic deck.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.947
I suggest we have a
conversation with Mr. Powers.

22:56.275 --> 22:58.516
About what? A plea bargain?

22:58.577 --> 23:00.420
What else would we talk to him about?

23:00.479 --> 23:03.153
We're gonna cut a deal
with a guy who shot 9 cops?

23:03.215 --> 23:05.957
He's already serving life with no parole,

23:06.352 --> 23:08.423
and he's merely the subcontractor here.

23:08.487 --> 23:12.435
Milt Winters is the author of
these murders. These are his targets.

23:13.192 --> 23:14.637
And am I wrong to assume

23:14.693 --> 23:16.798
that unless we identify the fourth target,

23:16.862 --> 23:20.400
Milt Winters will find
somebody to finish the job?

23:20.466 --> 23:21.774
On what planet

23:21.967 --> 23:25.176
do you think Powers is going to cooperate
with either the police or the DA?

23:25.237 --> 23:27.148
He hates us. He doesn't trust us.

23:27.206 --> 23:30.517
Dempsey thinks that we're capable of anything.

23:32.444 --> 23:34.185
Let's not disappoint him.

23:35.881 --> 23:40.227
As you probably know, Milt Winters'
lawyer was shot outside the DA's office.

23:40.486 --> 23:41.794
Not the smartest call.

23:41.854 --> 23:43.800
The place was crawling with officers.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.494
My partner's old man

23:45.557 --> 23:48.731
was in the 4-0. Same precinct
where you shot all those cops.

23:48.794 --> 23:50.535
You mean, the crooked cops.

23:50.696 --> 23:53.609
What's her daddy's name?
Maybe he was on my payroll.

23:53.699 --> 23:57.237
The officers got a good look at
the person who killed the lawyer.

23:59.138 --> 24:00.446
Recognize him?

24:01.573 --> 24:02.711
GOREN: Oops.

24:05.144 --> 24:07.351
That looks just like your son Taye.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.727
My son had nothing to do with it.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.387
We have the murder weapon.

24:12.451 --> 24:15.762
If you think it was easy
to plant fingerprints in '87,

24:15.821 --> 24:17.801
just think about what we can do now.

24:17.856 --> 24:19.062
You're a devil.

24:19.124 --> 24:21.161
You should see me in a blue dress.

24:21.226 --> 24:23.604
Yeah, well, I ain't afraid of the devil.

24:28.767 --> 24:30.906
You should be afraid of my partner,

24:32.438 --> 24:33.974
afraid for your son.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.055
I give you what you want,

24:45.351 --> 24:47.558
you all leave me and my son in peace?

24:47.686 --> 24:49.222
I'll make sure we do,

24:49.455 --> 24:51.457
you tell the grand jury what you know

24:51.523 --> 24:53.366
and testify at Milt's trial.

24:55.861 --> 24:57.306
Oh, man.

24:59.565 --> 25:03.513
Old Milt may have come to me for some favors.

25:04.269 --> 25:07.842
But, you know, being a man of peace,
naturally I turned him down.

25:15.781 --> 25:17.021
I would, um,

25:18.484 --> 25:20.760
be willing to talk about those favors.

25:21.086 --> 25:22.588
The ace of hearts,

25:24.556 --> 25:25.694
who is it?

25:26.825 --> 25:28.327
(SIGHING)

25:31.296 --> 25:33.936
Milt lost a lot of weight in prison.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.302
Got himself healthy.

25:36.735 --> 25:39.909
He started thinking that his doctor
kept him sick all those years,

25:39.972 --> 25:41.349
to bleed him dry.

25:44.243 --> 25:48.248
It's the ace of hearts,
his heart doctor, Dr. Chang.

25:49.314 --> 25:51.521
Dempsey said no such thing.

25:51.650 --> 25:54.187
That's a lie. He and I are brothers.

25:54.253 --> 25:57.029
Your brother told us who
your fourth target is.

25:57.689 --> 25:59.566
If you want any leniency from me,

25:59.625 --> 26:02.469
you'll call off any attempt
on your doctor's life.

26:03.796 --> 26:04.968
My doctor?

26:08.500 --> 26:11.140
It's a trick. Can't you see?

26:16.208 --> 26:19.519
My brother did not betray me,
would not betray me, ever.

26:20.679 --> 26:22.659
You don't trust your own son,

26:23.382 --> 26:26.454
but you trust Dempsey Powers.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.864
More now than ever.

26:30.122 --> 26:33.535
I've told him for 30 years
to lose weight, to exercise.

26:33.725 --> 26:35.500
So what does he do in prison?

26:35.561 --> 26:37.939
He loses weight. He exercises.

26:38.464 --> 26:40.205
So now he wants to kill me?

26:40.265 --> 26:42.336
You don't sound alarmed by this.

26:42.401 --> 26:43.744
Would alarm help?

26:44.103 --> 26:46.208
Milt is the one who lives in fear.

26:46.371 --> 26:48.112
You mean paranoia?

26:48.407 --> 26:49.818
The fear of death.

26:50.175 --> 26:52.655
His father died of a heart attack at 37.

26:53.145 --> 26:55.421
Milt thinks he lives on borrowed time.

26:57.749 --> 26:59.956
How old was Milt when his father died?

27:00.018 --> 27:01.122
16.

27:01.453 --> 27:03.933
Somehow he kept his father's store going.

27:10.162 --> 27:11.505
Right. Somehow.

27:11.597 --> 27:13.270
Dr. Chang, we'll assign

27:13.332 --> 27:16.472
a couple of detectives to keep an
eye on your office in the city.

27:16.535 --> 27:19.573
I don't work in the city anymore.
Don't live here either.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.777
I moved to Staten Island a year ago.

27:22.174 --> 27:24.711
I hardly come into the city at all anymore.

27:28.814 --> 27:31.226
Does Milt know you spend all
your time on Staten Island?

27:31.283 --> 27:32.421
Yes.

27:32.551 --> 27:35.555
He even made a donation to
the hospice I started there.

27:38.891 --> 27:42.771
Okay. Thank you, Doctor. Someone
will take you back to the ferry.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.542
If bicycle boy

27:48.267 --> 27:52.716
wouldn't visit his brother because
the subway didn't go to Greenhaven,

27:53.505 --> 27:57.317
how did he figure on getting to Staten
Island to shoot the good doctor?

28:00.979 --> 28:03.152
AHMAL: It was a delivery in one
of these offices over there.

28:03.215 --> 28:05.855
I don't know what office you're talking about.

28:05.918 --> 28:08.455
You wanted him to tell you where
he was making his delivery.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.056
That's what he just did, so he's done.

28:10.122 --> 28:12.625
You can't just come over here
and point it out to me, Ahmal?

28:12.691 --> 28:14.534
No, I'm fine right here, man.

28:16.962 --> 28:18.464
Wait, are you afraid of the water?

28:18.530 --> 28:21.875
I ain't afraid of some water. I just
don't... I just stay away from it.

28:21.934 --> 28:23.242
Well, you go over bridges, don't you?

28:23.302 --> 28:24.337
I don't take bridges.

28:24.403 --> 28:25.404
EAMES: What about the ferry?

28:25.470 --> 28:27.143
I just don't go on water, okay?

28:27.206 --> 28:28.776
I stay right over here, on the hard land.

28:28.840 --> 28:31.047
That's the biggest bunch
of nonsense I ever heard.

28:31.109 --> 28:33.419
This is your big day. You're
gonna take a ride on the ferry.

28:33.478 --> 28:34.923
- No, no, leave me be.
- Come on.

28:34.980 --> 28:36.357
- It's right over here. Come on.
- Leave me be. No.

28:36.415 --> 28:38.691
No, no, no. Please, please.

28:38.750 --> 28:41.731
Please, I don't, I swear. I'm gonna
pee myself. Please, just don't.

28:41.787 --> 28:45.098
Okay. All right. All right, calm down.

28:45.857 --> 28:47.200
Ahmal, calm down.

28:47.593 --> 28:50.437
Come on. You don't have to
take the ferry. Come on.

28:52.698 --> 28:54.871
Come on. It's going to be all right.

28:57.135 --> 28:59.843
You can stay right here on the hard land.

29:11.550 --> 29:14.793
He was supposed to do the hit on Milt's son.

29:15.187 --> 29:16.495
He hesitated.

29:16.555 --> 29:19.627
He waited for the son to get
away from the water's edge.

29:19.691 --> 29:22.399
Now, there's no way
that he's gonna take a job

29:22.461 --> 29:23.838
shooting someone on Staten Island.

29:23.895 --> 29:26.466
Fourth victim, the ace of
hearts, it's not the doctor.

29:26.531 --> 29:28.670
Milt's having somebody else killed.

29:29.568 --> 29:31.844
Dempsey wouldn't lie to us about that.

29:33.338 --> 29:36.148
But he would lie to us if he
was having someone killed.

29:36.208 --> 29:37.585
He's playing us.

29:39.011 --> 29:40.854
Yeah, he's playing all of us.

29:42.848 --> 29:45.419
Milt contracted those 3 hits.

29:47.386 --> 29:49.525
The fourth one is Dempsey's choice.

29:55.761 --> 29:57.934
We may be overestimating Mr. Powers' cunning.

29:57.996 --> 30:01.341
The idea he used Milt Winters' killing
spree to hide a killing of his own is...

30:01.400 --> 30:03.812
Overestimate a guy who put
9 cops in the hospital?

30:03.869 --> 30:05.405
You can't be serious.

30:05.504 --> 30:08.974
And cover the personnel at Greenhaven,
starting with the warden.

30:09.107 --> 30:11.383
Dempsey might have already made his move.

30:11.443 --> 30:14.583
I checked homicides going back 2 months.

30:15.914 --> 30:17.052
This one,

30:17.716 --> 30:20.196
last week, in Queens. Eduardo Escobar.

30:20.252 --> 30:22.254
Shot once straight down
through the top of the head.

30:22.321 --> 30:23.493
Dempsey's MO.

30:23.555 --> 30:25.694
Who the hell is Eduardo Escobar?

30:26.725 --> 30:28.864
A subway mechanic. Married last month.

30:28.927 --> 30:32.534
No priors, no known connection
to Dempsey Powers.

30:32.664 --> 30:35.736
If someone killed Escobar
on orders from Powers,

30:36.034 --> 30:40.107
isn't it reckless to advertise the
fact by using Powers' calling card?

30:40.172 --> 30:42.709
Reckless and bold.

30:43.742 --> 30:47.053
The act of someone proud of his
connection to Dempsey Powers.

30:50.749 --> 30:53.059
TAYE: I didn't kill no Eduardo Escobar.

30:53.151 --> 30:56.689
You gonna plant the gun you're
looking for, or just powder burns?

30:57.255 --> 30:59.166
Don't believe everything
your father tells you.

30:59.224 --> 31:00.794
I don't have to tell you anything.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.429
My father told me that, too.

31:02.494 --> 31:04.872
You keep following his advice,
and you'll end up just like him.

31:04.930 --> 31:06.000
Ma!

31:06.331 --> 31:07.810
Downstairs is clean.

31:08.166 --> 31:09.611
You won't find anything.

31:09.668 --> 31:13.411
Taye has his father's mouth, but
my husband and I raised him right.

31:13.572 --> 31:15.245
GOREN: You got a lot of new books.

31:15.307 --> 31:16.786
History of Cuba.

31:17.409 --> 31:18.752
Cuba Today.

31:19.411 --> 31:23.450
My final essay on parts of the world
where police don't practice racism.

31:23.515 --> 31:25.085
Definitely his father's mouth.

31:25.150 --> 31:28.029
Come on, Taye, let's let them do their work.

31:35.694 --> 31:38.402
This kid's inherited more
than just his father's mouth.

31:38.463 --> 31:41.307
Dempsey does nothing by accident.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.714
Spanish, Cuba

31:48.874 --> 31:51.411
probably figure into their long-term plans.

31:53.245 --> 31:57.421
And killing Eduardo Escobar
somehow gets them there.

32:01.653 --> 32:04.065
GLORIA: No. I never seen this man before.

32:05.390 --> 32:06.926
Eduardo had no enemies.

32:06.992 --> 32:09.700
He was gentle, always helping people.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.572
What about this one? You ever see him?

32:12.998 --> 32:14.978
No. Who are they?

32:15.233 --> 32:16.337
Just men.

32:16.735 --> 32:20.512
This is from Calabria, in the south of Italy.

32:24.309 --> 32:26.311
Did you go there for your honeymoon?

32:26.378 --> 32:29.291
No. Puerto Rico. We got married there.

32:32.184 --> 32:33.891
When did you go to Italy?

32:34.085 --> 32:35.496
I went last year.

32:37.656 --> 32:40.398
Well, Calabria's pretty rough country.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.461
People usually don't go there
unless they have family...

32:42.527 --> 32:43.972
You don't have family there, do you?

32:44.029 --> 32:45.064
No.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.167
EAMES: So you went with somebody?

32:47.799 --> 32:51.440
It was before I met Eduardo.
It's got nothing to do with this.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.752
Calabrese hard head. Have you
ever heard that expression?

33:05.517 --> 33:09.294
When I was a kid, I had a
barber who was from Calabria.

33:09.354 --> 33:11.994
He told me that the people
were very stubborn.

33:12.457 --> 33:15.097
He said that when you
take something from them,

33:15.160 --> 33:18.039
they don't give up until they get it back.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.607
Who is he, Ms. Escobar?

33:27.739 --> 33:28.877
Tony.

33:29.441 --> 33:30.715
Tony Sirvino.

33:31.276 --> 33:33.688
He thinks that Eduardo stole me from him.

33:37.048 --> 33:38.493
What does Mr. Sirvino do?

33:38.550 --> 33:40.154
He works for the city.

33:43.455 --> 33:45.366
The Department of Correction?

33:46.625 --> 33:48.366
Yes. He drives their bus.

33:53.398 --> 33:54.570
CARVER: An escape?

33:54.633 --> 33:57.512
After Dempsey testifies
for the grand jury tomorrow.

33:57.569 --> 34:00.413
Tony Sirvino's scheduled to
drive his bus back to Rikers.

34:00.472 --> 34:02.042
Sirvino grew up in the South Bronx.

34:02.107 --> 34:04.917
He went to school with Dempsey, and
Dempsey keeps tabs on his people.

34:04.976 --> 34:08.650
And he had his son kill Mr.
Escobar as a favor to Mr. Sirvino?

34:08.713 --> 34:10.283
This is... Brilliant.

34:10.982 --> 34:14.088
Once Dempsey got the contract from
Milt to make these three hits,

34:14.152 --> 34:15.722
he orchestrated everything.

34:15.786 --> 34:19.199
The checks from the lawyer, the playing cards,

34:19.591 --> 34:22.094
everything, to lead us back to him,

34:22.159 --> 34:24.106
so we would bring him before the grand jury.

34:24.161 --> 34:26.835
He knew he'd be transferred
from Greenhaven down to Rikers

34:26.898 --> 34:28.639
and driven back and forth
to the courthouse.

34:28.699 --> 34:30.702
Sirvino helps them escape,

34:31.402 --> 34:33.313
and Dempsey's on his way to Cuba with his son.

34:33.371 --> 34:35.373
Beyond the reach of extradition.

34:35.440 --> 34:38.717
I suddenly have a new found
respect for Mr. Powers.

34:39.744 --> 34:40.779
I ain't afraid of you.

34:40.844 --> 34:44.018
Well, you should be afraid. Using
your daddy's MO wasn't very smart.

34:44.081 --> 34:45.527
- Blood or no blood...
- Taye.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.120
- I'm Winston Malik,
- ...he's gonna take it out of your hide.

34:47.185 --> 34:48.357
- your father's lawyer. Now I'm yours.
- Or your mom's.

34:48.420 --> 34:49.455
But if you...

34:49.521 --> 34:50.726
I ain't giving you no reason to kill my pops.

34:50.789 --> 34:52.393
Taye's invoking his rights.

34:52.456 --> 34:54.664
He doesn't have anything more to say.

34:55.493 --> 34:57.734
Unless his son cooperates,

34:59.230 --> 35:01.608
we have no case against Mr. Powers.

35:03.034 --> 35:06.675
And once Mr. Powers finds out
we got wind to his escape plan,

35:06.938 --> 35:10.750
I doubt he'll testify to the grand
jury tomorrow against Milt Winters,

35:10.809 --> 35:13.790
and then that case will be gone, too.

35:13.979 --> 35:16.892
We haven't told Junior what
we know about the escape.

35:17.082 --> 35:18.823
We should be able to keep Powers in the dark

35:18.883 --> 35:20.362
until after he goes in
front of the grand jury.

35:20.418 --> 35:24.127
But once we derail his escape, he'll
never testify at Milt Winters' trial.

35:24.189 --> 35:25.691
We can use his grand jury testimony.

35:25.757 --> 35:30.502
Grand jury testimony is not admissible
at trial. I need Mr. Powers to appear.

35:30.595 --> 35:32.768
I'm betting that Dempsey Powers...

35:33.298 --> 35:36.245
I'm betting he knows
that if he escapes to Cuba,

35:36.401 --> 35:39.143
his grand jury testimony
can't be used at trial.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.175
He never intended to betray Milt.

35:43.041 --> 35:44.918
There is an exception, isn't there,

35:44.976 --> 35:48.355
that allows a grand jury
testimony to be used at trial

35:48.947 --> 35:52.019
if the witness has been threatened
into recanting his testimony?

35:52.083 --> 35:54.723
But who's going to threaten Dempsey Powers?

35:54.919 --> 35:56.421
His good friend Milt.

35:58.223 --> 36:00.965
Question. "What did Mr. Winters tell you?"

36:01.393 --> 36:03.532
Answer from Mr. Powers.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.997
"He was always complaining about all of them.

36:06.064 --> 36:08.135
"His wife, his son, his lawyer.

36:08.266 --> 36:10.041
"He wanted to get rid of them."

36:10.101 --> 36:11.603
That's what your brother, Dempsey,

36:11.670 --> 36:14.480
told the grand jury just a
little over an hour ago.

36:14.606 --> 36:15.676
Down the street from here.

36:15.740 --> 36:16.946
Question.

36:17.208 --> 36:20.985
"Did Mr. Winters solicit your help
in dealing with these individuals?"

36:21.146 --> 36:23.786
Answer from Mr. Powers. "Yes.

36:23.848 --> 36:26.852
"He offered to pay me $50,000
each to get them killed."

36:26.918 --> 36:28.295
Save your breath.

36:29.387 --> 36:32.834
Are you still convinced Mr. Powers
is looking out for your interests?

36:32.891 --> 36:36.930
More than ever. This doesn't mean squat

36:36.995 --> 36:39.635
until he says it at my trial.

36:39.731 --> 36:41.904
And no way on earth he rats me out.

36:41.966 --> 36:44.810
My son, in a heartbeat, but Dempsey, never!

36:45.170 --> 36:49.949
I'm so curious about this unquestioning trust.

36:50.008 --> 36:52.079
Is it based on anything?

36:52.243 --> 36:53.449
Greenhaven.

36:54.379 --> 36:56.950
He looked out for me from day one.

36:57.015 --> 36:59.188
EAMES: You paid for that protection.

37:00.251 --> 37:04.996
I was happy to share with him.
He had so little. I had so much.

37:05.156 --> 37:07.932
The only thing that you had so
much of in prison was fear.

37:07.992 --> 37:11.371
And Dempsey could smell it.
And he used it to gain your trust.

37:11.463 --> 37:14.933
I'm not wrong about Dempsey. I know people.

37:15.033 --> 37:16.478
And Dempsey knows you.

37:16.534 --> 37:18.013
He told us that he was checking you out.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.412
He was looking for an in on you.

37:19.471 --> 37:23.146
And he found it in an article
about a retailing miracle

37:23.208 --> 37:25.188
known as Winters Clothing.

37:30.982 --> 37:32.222
I…

37:34.753 --> 37:35.891
I have it.

37:36.921 --> 37:38.730
It's here.

37:41.493 --> 37:45.407
"Faced with his father's
unexpected death, 16 year old Milt

37:46.197 --> 37:48.234
"not only kept the family store afloat,

37:48.299 --> 37:49.869
"but it turned into the flagship

37:49.934 --> 37:53.643
"of the city's most successful
chain of men's clothing stores."

37:53.905 --> 37:58.820
There was a photo that was in the article.

38:03.882 --> 38:06.055
That's what tipped Dempsey off

38:06.317 --> 38:08.957
that you had help keeping the store afloat.

38:10.188 --> 38:12.759
That's right. Your dad's tailor, Morris Swope.

38:13.258 --> 38:14.737
Yeah, Uncle Morris.

38:17.428 --> 38:20.932
The man who looked out for
you when your father died,

38:21.332 --> 38:24.040
who showed you the ropes the first time

38:24.702 --> 38:27.478
that you were alone against the world.

38:31.409 --> 38:35.084
But Dempsey told us that he took one
look at that photo and he knew.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.853
He knew how to come at you.

38:36.915 --> 38:41.864
And it wasn't by being
a bully, or a flatterer,

38:43.955 --> 38:45.798
but as Morris Swope,

38:48.459 --> 38:50.200
the reassuring protector.

38:58.803 --> 39:00.578
Dempsey told us that it cracked him up.

39:00.638 --> 39:04.347
He pictured you sitting on his
knee, like a wooden dummy.

39:09.714 --> 39:13.389
He got around your natural suspicion

39:13.985 --> 39:16.124
by modeling your one

39:16.821 --> 39:19.859
positive adult relationship.

39:23.361 --> 39:26.035
He took you for a couple hundred grand

39:26.297 --> 39:31.508
and sold you out for immunity and a
few extra hours of TV every week.

39:31.769 --> 39:35.581
Sure, he's going to spend the rest
of his days in relative comfort.

39:36.474 --> 39:37.885
But you?

39:39.911 --> 39:42.551
You're looking at the death penalty.

39:47.652 --> 39:49.290
I mean, that just doesn't seem fair.

39:49.354 --> 39:50.958
To be fair,

39:51.890 --> 39:54.393
Mr. Winters, I'll settle
for life without parole

39:54.459 --> 39:57.099
in return for your admission of guilt.

40:00.298 --> 40:03.142
You think about it on your way back to Rikers.

40:18.249 --> 40:19.592
What's your name?

40:20.351 --> 40:21.591
Sirvino.

40:22.153 --> 40:23.655
You make these too tight, Sirvino,

40:23.721 --> 40:26.258
I'm gonna slap a brutality suit against you.

40:33.564 --> 40:35.100
(LAUGHING)

40:35.233 --> 40:36.610
Milton! They got you.

40:36.668 --> 40:38.579
I'm not sitting near this man.

40:40.738 --> 40:44.845
It's okay, Officer, we're old friends.

40:50.615 --> 40:52.424
Have a nice ride, gentlemen.

40:57.922 --> 41:01.301
The toughest guy in Greenhaven, a rat.

41:02.327 --> 41:05.171
Milton, be cool. Be cool.

41:05.229 --> 41:09.268
Cool? You spent the morning ratting me out.

41:10.468 --> 41:13.005
For what? More TV?

41:14.305 --> 41:16.251
That's what friendship's worth?

41:16.841 --> 41:17.876
Milt,

41:18.509 --> 41:20.955
don't worry, man, don't worry.

41:21.346 --> 41:22.984
It ain't gonna happen.

41:23.047 --> 41:25.550
I won't testify against you in court, okay?

41:25.650 --> 41:26.924
You already did.

41:26.985 --> 41:30.432
They playing you, Milton.
Just chill out and trust me.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.127
Just chill.

41:32.924 --> 41:34.460
Sitting on your knee.

41:35.927 --> 41:37.270
Very funny, huh?

41:37.695 --> 41:39.072
What the hell are you talking about?

41:39.130 --> 41:41.838
I don't care what hole
they put you in, Dempsey,

41:41.899 --> 41:43.674
I'm gonna reach out to you.

41:44.769 --> 41:46.248
You're a dead man.

41:47.105 --> 41:49.051
(WHISPERING)
You're a dead man.

41:50.942 --> 41:52.148
What are you doing?

41:52.210 --> 41:55.521
You know what, Milt?
I ain't going back to Haven.

41:55.580 --> 41:57.958
Just be cool. Be cool.

41:58.182 --> 41:59.217
You're breaking out?

41:59.283 --> 42:00.318
Shut up.

42:00.718 --> 42:03.665
Wait. Take... Take me with you.

42:04.122 --> 42:07.865
We're a team, right?
Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis.

42:07.925 --> 42:08.926
Shut up.

42:08.993 --> 42:11.872
Don't leave me. Dempsey, don't leave me.

42:15.066 --> 42:16.670
Don't leave me behind.

42:17.435 --> 42:18.971
It's a slice, Milton.

42:21.839 --> 42:24.877
Okay, okay, okay. Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

42:24.942 --> 42:26.319
Just put it down.

42:27.311 --> 42:29.120
Just put it down. It's empty.

42:29.580 --> 42:30.752
It's over.

42:36.521 --> 42:38.091
MILTON: What the hell's going on?

42:38.156 --> 42:39.635
Tony Curtis speaks.

42:39.690 --> 42:41.931
I told you to keep your mouth shut, fool.

42:41.993 --> 42:43.472
(MILTON EXCLAIMING)

42:47.799 --> 42:49.938
We got Milt's death threat on tape.

42:50.068 --> 42:53.140
Which makes Mr. Powers' grand
jury testimony admissible

42:53.204 --> 42:54.581
at Mr. Winters' trial.

42:54.639 --> 42:57.984
And we've got Mr. Powers
for the Escobar killing.

42:59.043 --> 43:00.454
You know, it's a shame.

43:00.511 --> 43:02.354
All this trust and loyalty,

43:07.919 --> 43:09.557
look where it gets you.
