00:37.737 --> 00:38.931
We shouldn't be here.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.006
Don't worry.

00:40.073 --> 00:42.234
Nobody saw us leave.

00:44.778 --> 00:45.745
Hey, l need that.

00:45.845 --> 00:47.813
What if somebody tries to call?

00:47.881 --> 00:49.109
Shh.

00:53.186 --> 00:54.676
What was that?

00:54.754 --> 00:56.016
Don't worry.

00:56.156 --> 00:57.453
Come here.

02:59.746 --> 03:01.805
Captain's Log, supplemental.

03:01.881 --> 03:03.075
After two weeks, we're close

03:03.149 --> 03:04.844
to repairing
the Varro's warp drive.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.146
Then there's the Varro crew.

03:06.219 --> 03:07.243
l'm starting to think

03:07.320 --> 03:09.151
they'd rather give up
warp travel than accept

03:09.222 --> 03:10.849
help from strangers.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.084
l thought we agreed

03:12.158 --> 03:13.989
Central Control
would be off-limits.

03:14.060 --> 03:16.688
We did, but l need to access
your warp assembly.

03:16.763 --> 03:18.128
That technology's classified.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.495
We have to reconfigure
the assembly

03:19.566 --> 03:20.828
if we're going
to finish this job.

03:20.900 --> 03:21.889
Then consider it finished.

03:22.001 --> 03:23.263
We've come this far...

03:23.369 --> 03:25.428
You've turned our ship
upside down for two weeks.

03:25.538 --> 03:27.369
l've yet to see any results.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.670
You might check
the antimatter injectors.

03:33.346 --> 03:34.643
Back on line.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.807
All you need now is
a jolt of antimatter

03:36.883 --> 03:39.545
from Voyager's engines
and you'll be back in business,

03:39.619 --> 03:42.782
but l need access
to your warp assembly.

03:44.257 --> 03:45.519
You know, l can understand

03:45.592 --> 03:47.617
why you're distrustful
of other species.

03:47.694 --> 03:50.925
Frankly, we've had a rough time
in the Delta Quadrant ourselves,

03:50.997 --> 03:53.522
but our two species have
made remarkable progress,

03:53.600 --> 03:55.625
working together
to repair your engines.

03:55.735 --> 03:56.861
We've come a long way

03:56.970 --> 03:58.961
since you ignored
our opening hails.

03:59.138 --> 04:00.696
Let's not throw all that away.

04:00.807 --> 04:04.743
l'll admit we do share
some things in common.

04:04.844 --> 04:07.711
We're both on long journeys,
looking for allies.

04:07.780 --> 04:10.214
ln many ways,
we're like cousins.

04:10.283 --> 04:11.272
''Cousins''?

04:11.351 --> 04:13.216
Well, distant cousins--
think about it.

04:13.286 --> 04:16.153
400 years ago, you started
out the same way we did--

04:16.221 --> 04:20.682
a single starship, a small crew,
facing the unknown

04:20.760 --> 04:22.421
and now, centuries later,

04:22.495 --> 04:24.656
you've grown
into a generational ship

04:24.731 --> 04:26.892
with a history
and culture all your own.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.491
When l look at your vessel,
l can't help but wonder

04:29.602 --> 04:31.729
if l'm seeing Voyager's future.

04:31.838 --> 04:34.898
Our journey could easily last
several generations.

04:35.074 --> 04:37.804
So, what do you say...
cousin?

04:39.612 --> 04:41.443
You can access the warp
assembly from here.

04:41.514 --> 04:42.913
Thank you.

04:42.982 --> 04:43.914
Status?

04:43.983 --> 04:45.314
Their plasma couplings
are on line.

04:45.385 --> 04:46.943
We're ready
for the antimatter transfer.

04:47.086 --> 04:48.781
Then let's get started.

04:48.855 --> 04:49.947
Janeway to Voyager.
Status?

04:50.089 --> 04:51.249
Ready here, Captain.

04:51.324 --> 04:52.985
lnitiate the transfer.

04:56.529 --> 04:59.259
Warp reactors 1 through 14
are coming on line.

04:59.332 --> 05:00.196
lt's working.

05:00.266 --> 05:01.756
Keep your fingers crossed.

05:02.935 --> 05:04.163
For luck.

05:23.923 --> 05:25.823
lf you're planning on leaving

05:25.892 --> 05:28.884
through the viewport,
you might want to get dressed.

05:28.961 --> 05:32.453
The interstellar vacuum
might get a little chilly.

05:33.533 --> 05:34.522
What?

05:34.634 --> 05:38.502
Oh. Funny.

05:38.571 --> 05:40.505
Come back to bed.

05:40.573 --> 05:41.904
l can't sleep.

05:41.974 --> 05:43.032
Cuddle.

05:43.142 --> 05:44.575
l can't cuddle.

05:44.644 --> 05:47.112
l told you we're not
going to get caught.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.546
lf someone had seen us, they
would've reported it by now.

05:49.615 --> 05:51.947
l'm violating
about half a dozen regulations

05:52.051 --> 05:54.952
by just being in this room,
and what we did earlier...

05:55.054 --> 05:58.046
l don't know if Starfleet
even has a regulation for that.

05:58.124 --> 05:59.455
What are you saying?

05:59.525 --> 06:02.050
Making love is a crime
in your culture?

06:02.128 --> 06:07.566
Yes! No. What l'm saying is
it's a breach of protocol.

06:07.633 --> 06:09.828
How romantic.

06:10.002 --> 06:11.970
The Captain instructed
all away teams--

06:12.071 --> 06:14.232
no personal interaction
with the Varro crew.

06:14.340 --> 06:15.705
l violated a direct order.

06:15.775 --> 06:17.470
Come back to bed.

06:17.543 --> 06:19.033
That's an order.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.148
Are all humans so jumpy?

06:27.220 --> 06:28.187
No.

06:28.254 --> 06:29.721
Only me.

06:33.626 --> 06:35.059
The warp engines.

06:35.128 --> 06:38.393
They started
the plasma transfer.

06:38.464 --> 06:40.455
We've got to get down there.

06:40.533 --> 06:41.522
We're late.

06:42.835 --> 06:44.530
What are you waiting for?

06:44.637 --> 06:46.434
To see what you look like
in my uniform.

06:50.376 --> 06:51.775
You don't understand.

06:51.844 --> 06:53.505
lf l'm not at my post...

06:53.579 --> 06:54.773
You'll be executed.

06:54.847 --> 06:56.212
Funny.

06:56.282 --> 06:58.113
We better go in separately.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.587
lmpressive.

07:08.661 --> 07:11.528
Just trying to orchestrate
the antimatter flow.

07:11.597 --> 07:13.997
You should try some Chopin
when you're done.

07:14.066 --> 07:16.500
Look who showed up
for the final movement.

07:16.602 --> 07:17.534
Excuse me?

07:17.603 --> 07:19.571
Just a little late for the joke

07:19.639 --> 07:21.197
as well as the job.

07:21.307 --> 07:24.242
l was checking the manifolds
in Segment 22.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.980
Warp reaction's destabilizing.

07:30.049 --> 07:31.346
Tal?

07:32.652 --> 07:33.914
l can't find the problem.

07:35.788 --> 07:40.452
We're less than a minute away
from multiple core breaches.

07:40.526 --> 07:42.221
Abort the transfer.

07:45.031 --> 07:46.794
So much for finger crossing.

07:46.866 --> 07:48.231
B'Elanna.

07:48.334 --> 07:50.427
l'm reading microfractures
all over the hull.

07:50.536 --> 07:52.094
Why couldn't we detect
that before?

07:52.205 --> 07:53.137
Good question.

07:53.206 --> 07:54.138
We'll have to check the hulls

07:54.207 --> 07:55.265
on each
of your vessel's segments.

07:55.374 --> 07:56.306
But that'll take days.

07:56.375 --> 07:58.070
The sooner we start,
the sooner we finish.

08:05.518 --> 08:06.485
Friendly people.

08:06.552 --> 08:08.452
They've had a lot
of bad experiences

08:08.521 --> 08:09.545
with other species.

08:09.622 --> 08:10.816
Well, l don't know.

08:10.923 --> 08:13.756
lt seems like your first
contact went pretty well.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.293
What's that supposed to mean?

08:15.361 --> 08:17.795
l'm just wondering where
you disappeared to today.

08:17.864 --> 08:18.831
l told you.

08:18.931 --> 08:20.592
l was checking
the plasma conduits in...

08:20.666 --> 08:22.657
ln Segment 22.
l know.

08:22.735 --> 08:24.828
They must have sonic
showers over there.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.802
You're a lot cleaner than
you were when you left.

08:27.874 --> 08:31.037
You are such a lousy liar.

08:31.110 --> 08:32.371
Haven't you learned
anything from me

08:32.445 --> 08:33.376
after five years?

08:33.446 --> 08:34.413
She's cute.

08:34.480 --> 08:35.412
Who?

08:35.481 --> 08:37.539
That assistant engineer, Tal.

08:37.616 --> 08:39.551
Cute enough.

08:39.619 --> 08:42.383
Oh, here we go again.

08:42.455 --> 08:43.386
What?!

08:43.456 --> 08:45.981
You. Going after
impossible women--

08:46.058 --> 08:50.256
a hologram, an ex-Borg,
the wrong twin,

08:50.329 --> 08:52.797
and now a girl
from a xenophobic species?

08:52.865 --> 08:55.265
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.892
l'm putting her out of my mind.
l promise.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.731
Good. Glad to hear it.

08:58.838 --> 09:00.533
l'm due back on the Bridge.

09:00.606 --> 09:01.971
See you in the morning.

09:05.011 --> 09:07.775
Computer, open a channel
to Varro ship,

09:07.847 --> 09:09.576
Segment 16, Station 204.

09:09.649 --> 09:12.812
Encode transmission with
security protocol Alpha-7.

09:12.919 --> 09:14.011
Channel open.

09:14.086 --> 09:15.553
What took you so long?

09:15.621 --> 09:17.953
l've been waiting 22 minutes
for you to call.

09:18.024 --> 09:19.821
l was testing myself,

09:19.926 --> 09:22.622
seeing how long
l could resist calling you.

09:22.695 --> 09:23.753
And?

09:23.829 --> 09:26.992
l lasted 22 minutes.

09:27.066 --> 09:29.466
Should l feel complimented
or insulted?

09:29.569 --> 09:34.029
Since this is the first chance
l've had to open a com-link...

09:34.140 --> 09:35.232
complimented.

09:35.341 --> 09:39.835
So... you liked what happened.

09:39.912 --> 09:42.881
Yeah. A lot.

09:42.982 --> 09:44.882
Enough to try it again?

09:44.984 --> 09:48.317
Absolutely,
but l've got to be honest.

09:48.387 --> 09:52.323
l wasn't expecting something
so... different.

09:52.391 --> 09:54.256
Neither was l.

09:54.327 --> 09:56.420
Our species look so similar.

09:56.495 --> 09:57.894
Well, at least on the surface.

09:57.964 --> 09:59.261
l would've never guessed

09:59.332 --> 10:01.027
when it came down
to the basics...

10:01.100 --> 10:02.294
well, let's just say,

10:02.401 --> 10:04.392
the birds and bees
would be very confused.

10:04.503 --> 10:07.301
''Birds and bees''?

10:07.373 --> 10:08.397
l'm telling you,

10:08.507 --> 10:10.202
you should take a look
at their database.

10:10.276 --> 10:13.177
They've got some pretty
amazing stuff on that ship.

10:13.245 --> 10:14.712
Stuff.

10:14.780 --> 10:17.715
Well, their environmental
control systems, for instance--

10:17.783 --> 10:19.614
it's completely regenerative.

10:19.685 --> 10:21.118
Zero waste.

10:21.187 --> 10:22.381
lmpressive.

10:22.455 --> 10:25.447
lt can be programmed to create
almost any habitat.

10:25.524 --> 10:27.719
lf you wanted to,
you could recreate Vulcan

10:27.793 --> 10:29.351
in your quarters
with that system.

10:29.428 --> 10:30.895
Why would l want to?

10:30.963 --> 10:33.488
A little taste of home
in the Delta Quadrant?

10:33.566 --> 10:34.965
Think about it--

10:35.134 --> 10:38.103
springtime on the shores
of Lake Yuron.

10:38.204 --> 10:41.002
l require a desk and a bed,
nothing more.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.869
You're missing the point.

10:42.942 --> 10:43.966
No doubt.

10:44.143 --> 10:47.544
These people have been
traveling for 400 years.

10:47.613 --> 10:50.173
They've learned a thing or two
about living comfortably.

10:50.249 --> 10:52.240
Our systems
are more than adequate.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.286
l give up.

10:54.353 --> 10:56.617
After only two minutes?

10:56.689 --> 10:58.213
Tuvok, how do you do it?

10:58.290 --> 11:01.054
l wait until his own
illogic overwhelms him.

11:03.529 --> 11:05.827
l'm detecting
an unauthorized transmission.

11:05.898 --> 11:06.865
Origin?

11:06.932 --> 11:07.864
Unknown.

11:07.933 --> 11:09.230
lt's been encoded.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.462
Find out where it's going.

11:13.806 --> 11:17.105
Where would you
most like to be right now?

11:17.176 --> 11:18.905
Besides your quarters?

11:18.978 --> 11:20.468
Besides my quarters.

11:20.546 --> 11:22.343
On a distant moon,

11:22.415 --> 11:25.248
where the air is warm
and the gravity is light.

11:25.317 --> 11:27.114
No bulkheads around me.

11:27.186 --> 11:30.587
Where, if l walk too quickly,
l can almost fly.

11:30.656 --> 11:32.351
l like that.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.086
What about you?

11:34.160 --> 11:37.527
Where would you most want
to be right now?

11:37.596 --> 11:38.756
Besides your cabin?

11:39.932 --> 11:41.490
Besides my cabin.

11:41.567 --> 11:42.693
Sorry. l can't come up

11:42.802 --> 11:44.633
with anything better
than your cabin.

11:44.737 --> 11:48.503
And what would you do
if you were here?

11:48.574 --> 11:49.632
Now?

11:49.742 --> 11:52.404
This very moment.

11:52.478 --> 11:56.005
l'd ask you to dim the lights.

11:56.148 --> 12:00.482
And what if l said... no?

12:00.553 --> 12:04.080
Okay. So, we leave
the lights on.

12:04.156 --> 12:06.886
The message has been sent
to the Varro ship.

12:07.026 --> 12:07.890
Segment 16.

12:08.027 --> 12:09.119
Living quarters.

12:10.629 --> 12:11.994
Uh, Commander?

12:12.064 --> 12:16.057
l think l can track
that down for you.

12:16.168 --> 12:18.796
Hold on.
Something's wrong.

12:18.904 --> 12:20.394
l'm losing the signal.

12:22.308 --> 12:23.570
Tal?

12:23.642 --> 12:25.542
The transmission has ended.

12:25.611 --> 12:26.908
lf it was a transmission.

12:26.979 --> 12:29.573
Could have just been
a glitch in the com system.

12:29.648 --> 12:30.910
Run a diagnostic.

12:35.054 --> 12:36.681
Finding the source
of these structural problems

12:36.756 --> 12:37.882
isn't going to be easy.

12:37.957 --> 12:39.424
They've already scanned
most of their ship

12:39.492 --> 12:40.686
and come up empty.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.352
l'm hoping
we'll do a better job.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.192
We should form smaller teams
to maximize efficiency.

12:45.264 --> 12:47.198
Agreed.
We'll work in pairs.

12:47.266 --> 12:50.099
Now, what l'd like to do is
start with their reactor room

12:50.202 --> 12:51.794
where we first
detected the problem...

12:51.904 --> 12:53.531
You owe me.

12:53.639 --> 12:54.571
What?

12:54.640 --> 12:55.766
Eyes front.

12:55.875 --> 12:58.435
Last night l had to
sabotage the com system

12:58.511 --> 13:00.240
to cover your tracks.

13:00.312 --> 13:01.609
You called her, didn't you?

13:01.680 --> 13:03.113
Guilty.

13:03.182 --> 13:05.013
How long has this been going on?

13:05.084 --> 13:06.574
The truth.

13:06.652 --> 13:08.847
From the moment
we first saw each other.

13:08.921 --> 13:11.515
lt was like touching
an open plasma relay.

13:11.590 --> 13:13.888
Hmm. Sounds serious.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.517
Maybe it is.

13:15.594 --> 13:16.652
Has it occurred to you

13:16.729 --> 13:18.890
that you're breaking
a few dozen protocols?

13:18.964 --> 13:21.364
We know what we're getting into.

13:22.601 --> 13:23.659
Do you?

13:23.769 --> 13:24.758
Our duty assignment.

13:24.870 --> 13:25.802
We're to survey

13:25.871 --> 13:27.634
the generational ship
from Astrometrics.

13:32.378 --> 13:34.846
Teams Alpha and Gamma
have finished scanning

13:34.914 --> 13:36.279
Sections 1 through 64.

13:36.348 --> 13:39.146
Kind of puts a Borg cube
to shame, doesn't it?

13:39.218 --> 13:41.550
The vessel's technology
is impressive,

13:41.620 --> 13:43.747
but its construction
is haphazard.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.553
l guess they sort of improvised
as they went along.

13:48.828 --> 13:52.559
Seven, you've been around
humans for a while now.

13:52.631 --> 13:55.964
What do you think about love?

13:56.068 --> 13:58.536
We're scanning
for microfractures.

13:58.637 --> 14:00.434
l don't see the relevance.

14:00.506 --> 14:03.066
Just curious.

14:03.175 --> 14:05.871
Parental love, romantic love,

14:06.011 --> 14:08.377
affection between friends.
Specify.

14:08.447 --> 14:10.574
Romantic love.

14:10.649 --> 14:13.277
An attraction based
on sexual desire,

14:13.352 --> 14:15.718
one that facilitates
procreation.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.653
l guess l'm asking
the wrong person.

14:17.723 --> 14:19.384
Not at all.
The Borg have referenced

14:19.458 --> 14:22.359
this condition in over 6,000
assimilated species.

14:22.428 --> 14:25.989
''Condition''? You make it sound
like a disease.

14:26.065 --> 14:27.828
Physiologically, it bears

14:27.900 --> 14:29.765
a striking similarity
to disease.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.769
A series
of biochemical responses

14:31.837 --> 14:33.498
that trigger
an emotional cascade,

14:33.606 --> 14:35.665
impairing normal functioning.

14:35.774 --> 14:36.900
Forget it.

14:40.613 --> 14:43.275
Are you in love, Ensign?

14:47.753 --> 14:50.620
l guess that's what
l've been asking myself.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.456
You're glowing.

14:57.529 --> 14:59.292
l beg your pardon?

14:59.365 --> 15:01.890
Your epidermis luminesced.

15:02.001 --> 15:04.469
Huh...

15:04.536 --> 15:06.003
Must be the lighting in here.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.301
No, it was you.

15:12.044 --> 15:13.136
You should report to Sick Bay.

15:13.212 --> 15:14.873
lt's nothing.

15:14.947 --> 15:16.574
You must comply.

15:20.953 --> 15:21.885
Lie still.

15:21.954 --> 15:22.886
l feel fine.

15:22.988 --> 15:24.421
No doubt
you're feeling wonderful.

15:24.490 --> 15:26.788
Your beta endorphins
are abnormally elevated.

15:26.859 --> 15:27.883
Really?

15:27.960 --> 15:28.892
You've been spending

15:28.961 --> 15:30.394
a lot of time
on the generational ship.

15:30.462 --> 15:32.896
Do you recall coming into
contact with any toxins?

15:32.965 --> 15:34.330
Antimatter radiation?

15:34.400 --> 15:35.731
No.

15:35.801 --> 15:37.530
Maybe something in one
of their medical bays--

15:37.636 --> 15:39.160
a biological agent?

15:39.271 --> 15:40.431
No.

15:40.539 --> 15:42.268
Did you consume
any of their cuisine?

15:42.341 --> 15:43.308
No.

15:43.409 --> 15:45.673
Doctor, there is unusual
synaptic activity

15:45.744 --> 15:47.302
in his cerebral cortex.

15:47.379 --> 15:48.812
No kidding.

15:48.881 --> 15:50.781
This could be the work
of an alien virus.

15:50.849 --> 15:52.714
We'll have to initiate
full quarantine protocols.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.151
lnform the Captain
and request a bio-alert.

15:55.220 --> 15:56.209
Wait.

15:58.390 --> 16:00.255
There's no need for that.

16:00.326 --> 16:01.293
l can explain.

16:01.360 --> 16:02.657
l'm listening.

16:06.231 --> 16:09.132
Could you give us some privacy?

16:09.234 --> 16:10.758
lf there is the possibility
of an epidemic

16:10.869 --> 16:12.632
the Doctor may require
my assistance.

16:12.738 --> 16:15.832
There isn't and he won't.

16:15.941 --> 16:17.670
Please.

16:30.622 --> 16:34.388
Last night, l had an...

16:34.460 --> 16:36.587
encounter
with one of the Varro.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.391
Encounter?

16:38.464 --> 16:42.901
A... personal encounter.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.469
Specifically?

16:48.841 --> 16:51.401
Sex. We had sex.

16:51.477 --> 16:54.344
You had intimate contact
with an alien species

16:54.413 --> 16:55.471
without medical clearance?

16:55.547 --> 16:56.673
lt was in the heat
of the moment.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.444
l didn't think anything
like this would happen.

16:58.517 --> 16:59.643
Correction.
lf you'd been thinking,

16:59.718 --> 17:00.844
you would have
considered the risks

17:00.953 --> 17:02.750
and exercised restraint.

17:02.788 --> 17:03.982
Sit down.

17:04.056 --> 17:05.717
You'll need
a full biomedical workup,

17:05.790 --> 17:07.622
and your ''friend''
will have to come in as well.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.184
Do we have to drag her
into this?

17:10.262 --> 17:12.560
lt is my medical responsibility,

17:12.631 --> 17:14.656
which, l'm sorry to say,
also requires me

17:14.733 --> 17:16.223
to report this to the Captain.

17:25.611 --> 17:27.545
l expected more from you.

17:27.613 --> 17:29.808
l'm sorry.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.816
l... don't know
what l was thinking.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.317
Don't you?
l've seen Tal.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.876
She's an impressive young woman,
beautiful,

17:35.954 --> 17:37.182
but that's no excuse

17:37.256 --> 17:40.225
to ignore your obligations
as a Starfleet officer.

17:40.292 --> 17:41.350
Yes, ma'am.

17:41.427 --> 17:43.292
There's a reason
you took a semester

17:43.362 --> 17:45.421
of interspecies protocol
at the Academy.

17:45.497 --> 17:46.896
There's also a reason

17:46.999 --> 17:49.024
why the Handbook
on Personal Relationships

17:49.134 --> 17:50.601
is three centimeters thick.

17:50.669 --> 17:52.034
''All Starfleet personnel must

17:52.104 --> 17:53.765
''obtain authorization
from their CO

17:53.872 --> 17:56.204
''as well as clearance
from their medical officer

17:56.275 --> 17:58.334
''before initiating
an intimate relationship

17:58.410 --> 17:59.536
with an alien species.''

17:59.611 --> 18:00.669
Bravo. Unfortunately,

18:00.779 --> 18:03.748
your recitation
comes a little late.

18:05.184 --> 18:06.481
According to the Doctor,

18:06.552 --> 18:08.782
your condition isn't
life-threatening.

18:08.854 --> 18:11.823
There's no reason
to confine you to Sick Bay,

18:11.890 --> 18:14.381
but l do agree
with his recommendation

18:14.460 --> 18:17.623
to run full bio-scans
on both you and Tal.

18:19.531 --> 18:21.465
And her people need to be told,

18:21.533 --> 18:24.058
so they can evaluate
any bio-threat

18:24.169 --> 18:27.434
you might've introduced
into their population.

18:27.506 --> 18:29.235
We're trying to help
these people, Ensign,

18:29.308 --> 18:30.832
earn their trust.

18:31.009 --> 18:31.976
l was even hoping

18:32.077 --> 18:34.875
they might return the favor,
share their technology,

18:34.980 --> 18:37.505
their insights into
long-term space travel,

18:37.583 --> 18:39.847
but your little escapade
put that in jeopardy.

18:40.919 --> 18:42.978
Permission to speak freely.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.250
With all due respect...

18:45.324 --> 18:48.020
this wasn't a fling.

18:48.093 --> 18:50.186
l've really gotten to know Tal,

18:50.262 --> 18:53.197
and l've developed
true feelings for her.

18:53.265 --> 18:54.664
Noted.

18:54.733 --> 18:57.998
But there are regulations,
and you've broken them.

18:58.103 --> 19:01.664
l'm entering a formal
reprimand into your record

19:01.773 --> 19:03.297
and l'm ordering you
to break off

19:03.408 --> 19:04.670
this relationship.

19:04.743 --> 19:06.040
Do you understand?

19:09.515 --> 19:10.641
Yes, ma'am.

19:10.716 --> 19:11.876
Dismissed.

19:20.592 --> 19:24.028
Commander, l wanted to share
a few security concerns.

19:24.096 --> 19:25.586
A few days ago, l noticed

19:25.664 --> 19:28.360
some Mess Hall supplies
had disappeared--

19:28.433 --> 19:30.833
liquid nutriments,
emergency rations,

19:30.969 --> 19:33.267
nothing to warrant
a Red Alert, but...

19:33.338 --> 19:36.239
l took the liberty
of investigating on my own.

19:36.308 --> 19:38.242
Take a look at this.

19:38.310 --> 19:41.473
Unauthorized use
of the Mess Hall replicator

19:41.547 --> 19:42.878
is hardly a felony.

19:42.981 --> 19:44.846
lt wasn't just unauthorized.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.680
Someone accessed the ship's

19:46.752 --> 19:49.585
environmental controls
from that station.

19:49.655 --> 19:53.853
Life support was routed
to Jefferies Tube G-33, Deck 15.

19:53.926 --> 19:56.895
lsn't that section
normally uninhabited?

19:56.995 --> 19:59.486
Whoever did this,
encoded the procedure

19:59.565 --> 20:01.294
so it wouldn't be detected.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.440
lt appears we have intruders.

20:18.517 --> 20:21.315
lt looks like
a Varro scanning device.

20:21.386 --> 20:24.719
Breathable oxygen is
confined to this chamber

20:24.790 --> 20:27.953
and the area immediately
behind this hatch.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.357
Stand back.

20:39.104 --> 20:40.401
Come in.

20:43.775 --> 20:45.367
Work?

20:45.444 --> 20:48.379
No. l'm just tormenting myself
with what-ifs.

20:48.447 --> 20:49.778
What if l had the chance

20:49.848 --> 20:51.782
to actually see
that pulsar field,

20:51.850 --> 20:53.841
go there instead
of just squinting

20:53.919 --> 20:55.853
at it through
long-range sensors?

20:55.921 --> 20:57.650
Too far off your course, huh?

20:57.723 --> 20:59.623
Too close
to an inhabited planet.

20:59.691 --> 21:01.591
''They might make
contact with us.''

21:01.693 --> 21:02.921
''lt's too dangerous.''

21:02.961 --> 21:04.588
lt's always the same thing.

21:04.663 --> 21:06.858
The mighty generational ship.

21:06.932 --> 21:10.993
All we do is run away
from anything that's different.

21:12.104 --> 21:15.596
But that's going to change.

21:15.707 --> 21:18.005
l'm afraid
l've got some bad news.

21:24.716 --> 21:26.946
l, uh...

21:27.052 --> 21:29.043
l can't see you anymore.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.749
Captain's orders.

21:31.823 --> 21:34.053
How did she find out?

21:34.126 --> 21:36.219
Something happened
to me this morning.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.229
l had a strange sensation,

21:38.297 --> 21:40.231
and then my skin luminesced,
just like last night.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.893
That shouldn't have happened.

21:43.001 --> 21:45.765
Our species are too dissimilar.

21:45.871 --> 21:47.270
What shouldn't have happened?

21:48.340 --> 21:50.331
We call it olan'vora...

21:50.442 --> 21:51.966
''the shared heart.''

21:52.077 --> 21:53.942
When two of us merge...

21:54.012 --> 21:56.845
You know
the biological connection

21:56.915 --> 21:58.439
we had last night?

21:58.517 --> 22:00.917
lt becomes stronger.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.887
lt won't hurt you, Harry,

22:03.989 --> 22:05.581
but it will change you.

22:05.657 --> 22:08.592
lt'll change both of us...

22:08.660 --> 22:10.719
bring us closer.

22:10.796 --> 22:13.731
So, can this process
be reversed?

22:13.799 --> 22:15.960
ln time...

22:18.036 --> 22:20.937
if we stay away from each other,

22:21.039 --> 22:23.303
but if we don't...

22:23.375 --> 22:25.104
the more we're together,

22:25.177 --> 22:27.668
the harder it will be
to stop it.

22:29.715 --> 22:32.309
But then, you have your orders.

22:32.384 --> 22:34.318
Orders.

22:36.722 --> 22:38.656
lt's an old story.

22:38.724 --> 22:41.659
Boy meets girl from the
wrong side of the galaxy.

22:41.727 --> 22:42.955
Boy loses girl.

22:43.061 --> 22:45.529
And girl loses boy.

22:45.597 --> 22:49.328
lt's not like we didn't know
this was going to end.

22:49.434 --> 22:52.870
At least we had two weeks.

22:52.938 --> 22:55.736
Two great weeks.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.272
Good-bye, Harry.

23:02.314 --> 23:03.611
Bye.

23:07.986 --> 23:11.251
Are you really going
to let me leave?

23:11.323 --> 23:14.884
lf that's what you want.

23:14.993 --> 23:16.961
lt's not.

23:19.331 --> 23:21.265
Welcome aboard.

23:21.333 --> 23:24.097
Normally we like to know
something about our guests

23:24.202 --> 23:25.897
before we invite them
to join us.

23:26.037 --> 23:27.937
Care to tell us
how you got here?

23:28.039 --> 23:29.370
Through a docking port.

23:29.441 --> 23:32.069
Your entry would have triggered
an intruder alert.

23:32.144 --> 23:35.113
Your technology
is easy to circumvent.

23:35.180 --> 23:38.377
lt doesn't matter
how l got here.

23:38.450 --> 23:41.044
l'm not going back.

23:41.119 --> 23:42.552
That remains to be seen.

23:42.621 --> 23:43.553
You haven't explained

23:43.622 --> 23:45.647
your reasons for leaving
the generational ship.

23:45.724 --> 23:48.284
l'm not a criminal,
if that's what you think.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.726
lf you leave me
at the next inhabited system,

23:50.796 --> 23:52.127
l'll manage from there.

23:52.264 --> 23:55.722
Your next stop is the brig
unless you answer my questions.

23:58.703 --> 24:01.035
l came aboard four days ago

24:01.139 --> 24:03.198
with one of the work details.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.071
Why?

24:05.143 --> 24:07.008
Our ship's not the paradise

24:07.078 --> 24:08.841
our leaders make it out to be.

24:08.914 --> 24:11.678
There are thousands of us
who feel like prisoners, and...

24:11.750 --> 24:12.944
others who...

24:14.886 --> 24:16.353
Continue.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.424
There are...

24:19.491 --> 24:22.892
rumors of a movement...

24:23.028 --> 24:25.121
people who want
to leave the ship.

24:25.197 --> 24:27.893
Some of them are willing
to take violent action.

24:27.999 --> 24:29.694
Can you be more specific?

24:30.802 --> 24:32.895
This is a trick.

24:33.004 --> 24:33.936
A trick?

24:34.005 --> 24:36.439
You're trying to get me
to expose the movement.

24:36.508 --> 24:37.805
Our leaders put you up to this.

24:37.876 --> 24:39.776
On the contrary.

24:39.845 --> 24:41.642
We haven't even
told them we found you.

24:41.713 --> 24:43.772
You're lying.

24:43.849 --> 24:45.441
l don't have time for a debate.

24:45.517 --> 24:46.916
You asked for asylum, fine.

24:46.985 --> 24:48.646
l'll consider it,

24:48.720 --> 24:50.950
but only if you
answer my questions.

24:51.056 --> 24:52.216
What movement?

24:55.727 --> 24:57.854
Contact the Varro authorities.

24:57.929 --> 25:01.057
Let them know we've found
one of their people,

25:01.132 --> 25:02.895
and take him to the brig.

25:06.638 --> 25:09.869
You can tell the authorities
that l'm not the only one.

25:09.975 --> 25:12.443
There are hundreds more like me.

25:25.991 --> 25:28.084
Learn anything about
this supposed uprising?

25:28.159 --> 25:31.492
Jippeq said the rumors
are just that-- rumors--

25:31.563 --> 25:34.555
but he's questioning our
stowaway just to be certain.

25:34.633 --> 25:38.194
New protocols
for working with the Varro.

25:38.303 --> 25:40.134
After the incident
with Ensign Kim,

25:40.205 --> 25:42.571
they insisted we keep
our crews segregated.

25:42.641 --> 25:43.835
That's pretty severe.

25:43.909 --> 25:45.740
Harry violated protocol.

25:45.810 --> 25:47.175
Frankly, l understand
their position.

25:47.245 --> 25:49.941
ls that why you
came down so hard on him?

25:50.015 --> 25:53.075
A formal reprimand for being
intimate with a young woman?

25:53.151 --> 25:55.244
l know it seems
a little extreme...

25:55.320 --> 25:58.255
but l wanted to leave
a lasting impression.

25:58.323 --> 26:00.018
Chalk it up to growing pains.

26:00.091 --> 26:02.423
Well, he looks pained,
all right.

26:02.494 --> 26:04.359
Until now,
he's had a spotless record.

26:06.498 --> 26:08.329
Maybe you should reconsider.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.958
What are you implying?

26:10.068 --> 26:12.832
Are you angry
because Harry disobeyed orders

26:12.938 --> 26:14.235
or because he let you down?

26:14.306 --> 26:16.240
l set the same standards
for all my officers.

26:16.308 --> 26:18.276
lf l object
to one of your decisions,

26:18.376 --> 26:21.038
you'll hear me out...
even insist l speak up.

26:21.112 --> 26:22.875
You're my First Officer.
He's an Ensign.

26:23.014 --> 26:25.209
He hasn't earned the right
to question my orders

26:25.283 --> 26:26.841
whatever his personal views.

26:26.918 --> 26:28.215
l see.

26:28.286 --> 26:30.220
Engineering to the Captain.

26:30.288 --> 26:31.220
Yes?

26:31.289 --> 26:32.722
We found something.

26:32.791 --> 26:34.349
On my way.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.221
Do your officers make a habit

26:37.295 --> 26:38.887
of seducing the species
they encounter?

26:38.997 --> 26:41.158
Certainly not,
but it's my understanding

26:41.232 --> 26:42.722
that this relationship
was consensual.

26:42.801 --> 26:44.268
l find that difficult
to believe.

26:44.336 --> 26:47.066
We don't share your cavalier
attitude toward intimacy.

26:47.172 --> 26:49.037
Our attitude is
anything but cavalier.

26:49.107 --> 26:50.699
Ensign Kim has already
been reprimanded.

26:50.809 --> 26:53.369
What about Tal?
What happens to her?

26:53.445 --> 26:55.345
ln our society, mating
is taken very seriously.

26:55.413 --> 26:58.109
When two people choose each
other, the bonding is permanent.

26:58.183 --> 26:59.309
They become
biochemically linked.

26:59.384 --> 27:01.147
Separation is rare.

27:01.252 --> 27:03.277
lt induces illness,
sometimes fatal.

27:03.321 --> 27:04.413
What's to become of Tal

27:04.489 --> 27:07.185
when your Ensign flies off
in search of his next conquest?

27:09.828 --> 27:11.090
Captain.

27:11.162 --> 27:12.595
You found something?

27:12.664 --> 27:14.131
We've detected microfractures

27:14.199 --> 27:15.826
in one of Voyager's
docking ports.

27:16.001 --> 27:16.831
Microfractures?

27:17.002 --> 27:18.435
That's the same problem
we've been having.

27:18.503 --> 27:19.561
A coincidence?

27:19.671 --> 27:21.468
l had suspicions that it wasn't.

27:21.539 --> 27:22.836
Seven confirmed them.

27:22.907 --> 27:24.636
Observe.
Silicon-based parasites

27:24.709 --> 27:26.301
which feed on duranium alloys.

27:26.378 --> 27:28.278
Apparently,
they began replicating

27:28.346 --> 27:30.177
on the Varro ship's hull
several months ago

27:30.248 --> 27:31.715
and then migrated to Voyager.

27:31.783 --> 27:32.715
We analyzed them

27:32.784 --> 27:35.378
and found artificial
gene sequences.

27:35.453 --> 27:36.977
The parasites are synthetic.

27:37.055 --> 27:38.886
They may have been
created by someone

27:39.024 --> 27:40.491
aboard your vessel.

27:40.558 --> 27:42.788
Sabotage?
l don't believe it.

27:42.861 --> 27:44.419
Perhaps not everyone

27:44.496 --> 27:47.329
is content to be
in your collective.

28:01.613 --> 28:02.807
Tal, are you there?

28:02.947 --> 28:04.312
Harry?

28:04.382 --> 28:05.474
l can't keep this com-link open.

28:05.550 --> 28:06.710
Where are you?

28:06.785 --> 28:08.150
By my computer.

28:08.219 --> 28:10.449
Okay.
Get ready for a ride.

28:10.522 --> 28:11.454
l'm locking on.

28:11.523 --> 28:12.547
A ride?

28:23.802 --> 28:25.099
Where are we?

28:25.203 --> 28:26.602
A shuttlecraft.

28:26.671 --> 28:27.603
Shuttlecraft?

28:27.672 --> 28:29.139
A short-range vessel.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.332
We use it for away missions.

28:32.077 --> 28:33.408
We can go anywhere we want?

28:33.478 --> 28:34.410
Anywhere.

28:34.479 --> 28:35.503
For a while anyway.

28:35.580 --> 28:38.777
l'm not due back on Voyager
until 1900 hours.

28:38.850 --> 28:41.785
They think l'm still out
repairing a hull fracture.

28:41.853 --> 28:43.411
l finished early.

28:46.091 --> 28:47.888
You're a fugitive now.

28:47.959 --> 28:50.826
How many protocols
did you break this time?

28:50.895 --> 28:52.260
Let's see...

28:52.330 --> 28:54.525
unauthorized use
of a shuttlecraft...

28:54.599 --> 28:55.759
kidnapping...

28:55.834 --> 28:58.462
Direct violation
of the Captain's orders...

28:59.738 --> 29:01.729
l must be crazy.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.205
l like you crazy.

29:05.944 --> 29:07.241
Navigation?

29:07.312 --> 29:09.337
Oh, careful.
That's the weapons array.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.974
You know, you almost vaporized
your living quarters.

29:13.251 --> 29:15.446
Well, they could use
a good cleaning.

29:16.788 --> 29:18.278
Let's go somewhere.

29:18.356 --> 29:19.721
Where?

29:19.791 --> 29:22.919
There's a nebula about
300,000 kilometers from here.

29:22.994 --> 29:24.962
l've been watching it
on the sensors

29:25.029 --> 29:26.291
for the past few days.

29:26.364 --> 29:29.299
Oh, l would love to see it
with my own eyes.

29:29.400 --> 29:30.492
Have a seat.

29:42.347 --> 29:44.577
Look at this--
a subspace vacuole

29:44.649 --> 29:46.173
near the center of the cloud.

29:46.251 --> 29:49.687
lt must act
as a gravitational anchor.

29:49.754 --> 29:54.316
There's so much data here,
it'll take weeks to analyze.

29:54.392 --> 29:56.417
Do you have a storage device?

29:56.494 --> 29:58.291
We need to download
these readings.

29:58.363 --> 29:59.387
What?

29:59.464 --> 30:00.897
l've just never seen

30:00.965 --> 30:03.900
anyone so excited about
a class-3 nebula before.

30:04.068 --> 30:06.593
Maybe you've been taking them
for granted.

30:06.704 --> 30:08.604
Maybe l have.

30:10.175 --> 30:11.836
Don't stop.

30:14.245 --> 30:16.805
You're beautiful
when you're scanning.

30:16.881 --> 30:19.406
ls that what you say to every
girl you take for a ride?

30:19.484 --> 30:20.951
l bet you've left a trail

30:21.085 --> 30:23.952
of broken hearts
across the Delta Quadrant.

30:24.088 --> 30:25.248
Actually...

30:29.127 --> 30:30.651
Problem?

30:30.728 --> 30:33.390
Stray radiation from the nebula.

30:33.464 --> 30:35.455
l thought it was
the proximity alarm.

30:35.533 --> 30:37.967
You said we had
a couple of hours.

30:38.069 --> 30:41.300
No one's going
to come looking for us.

30:41.372 --> 30:42.839
Oh, you don't know
Commander Tuvok.

30:42.941 --> 30:44.875
lf he sees one electron
out of place,

30:44.943 --> 30:46.410
he calls for Red Alert.

30:50.481 --> 30:52.176
Here we are alone,

30:52.250 --> 30:56.186
and all l can think about
is duty and orders.

30:56.254 --> 30:58.381
Those things are important.

30:58.456 --> 31:00.924
l think about them, too.

31:01.025 --> 31:05.724
But sometimes you need to follow
a different kind of protocol.

31:05.763 --> 31:08.425
lf you believe in something
strongly enough,

31:08.499 --> 31:10.023
you can't ignore it...

31:10.134 --> 31:13.433
even if it means
breaking a few rules.

31:13.538 --> 31:17.201
That's why l took this shuttle,
but every time l break a rule,

31:17.275 --> 31:21.143
l feel like my skull
is going to decompress.

31:21.212 --> 31:24.045
l'm like some kind
of... Borg drone--

31:24.115 --> 31:25.605
programmed--

31:25.683 --> 31:28.948
except l was designed to be
the perfect Starfleet officer.

31:29.087 --> 31:30.554
Top of his class...

31:30.622 --> 31:33.682
captain of the velocity
team, interstellar honors.

31:33.758 --> 31:35.282
First field assignment--

31:35.360 --> 31:37.658
Bridge officer on a starship.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.219
Every cadet's dream come true.

31:41.399 --> 31:43.890
You're not a program.

31:44.002 --> 31:47.096
ln fact, l envy your freedom.

31:47.205 --> 31:49.935
l mean, your crew's mission--
to seek out life...

31:50.008 --> 31:52.408
what could be more liberating?

31:52.477 --> 31:54.570
You explore the unknown.

31:56.414 --> 32:00.407
Don't be afraid to explore
what's happening between us.

32:07.959 --> 32:09.153
Oh, no.

32:09.227 --> 32:10.990
The Delta Flyer.

32:11.062 --> 32:12.222
Commander Tuvok?

32:12.297 --> 32:13.889
We're being hailed.

32:18.169 --> 32:22.196
Well, you better answer them
before they open fire.

32:25.009 --> 32:26.408
Kim here.

32:26.477 --> 32:27.774
Ensign, you are

32:27.845 --> 32:29.938
in direct violation
of the Captain's orders.

32:30.014 --> 32:33.916
Return to Voyager immediately
and bring Derran Tal with you.

32:33.985 --> 32:36.112
Yes, sir, but why bring Tal?

32:36.187 --> 32:38.348
She's wanted
by the Varro authorities

32:38.423 --> 32:40.914
regarding an act of sabotage.

32:48.199 --> 32:50.326
There's no point in lying.

32:50.435 --> 32:51.800
We found a schematic
for the parasite

32:51.903 --> 32:53.837
on your personal database.

32:53.905 --> 32:57.432
You realize this could
destroy our ship, our home?

32:57.542 --> 32:59.567
To some of us,
it's more like a prison.

32:59.677 --> 33:02.043
So you've resorted to sabotage,

33:02.146 --> 33:03.613
no doubt involving him.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.616
Mr. Kim's complicity
remains to be proven.

33:05.683 --> 33:08.049
He had nothing to do
with our movement.

33:08.119 --> 33:09.108
''Movement''?

33:09.187 --> 33:10.119
Tell them.

33:10.188 --> 33:12.213
lt's none of their concern.

33:12.290 --> 33:13.814
lf you want our help,
you'll need to explain.

33:13.891 --> 33:15.825
She's referring to a small group
of dissidents...

33:15.893 --> 33:16.860
lt's not a small group.

33:16.928 --> 33:17.860
There are hundreds of us.

33:17.929 --> 33:19.226
What are you trying to achieve?

33:19.297 --> 33:20.423
Our freedom--

33:20.498 --> 33:22.489
the right to live as we choose,

33:22.567 --> 33:23.693
to go where we choose.

33:23.801 --> 33:25.894
How will you accomplish that
if your vessel is destroyed?

33:26.037 --> 33:27.937
We're not trying to destroy it.

33:28.039 --> 33:29.700
We're trying to dismantle it.

33:29.807 --> 33:31.900
The parasites
weren't placed randomly.

33:32.043 --> 33:34.944
They're targeting the linkages
between segments.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.345
Each segment will
become its own ship.

33:37.415 --> 33:40.816
People can decide
whether to go or stay.

33:40.885 --> 33:42.216
You're destroying the work

33:42.286 --> 33:44.948
of every generation
that came before you.

33:45.023 --> 33:47.958
Our ship isn't
just a collection of modules.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.551
lt's an expression
of unity, tradition.

33:50.628 --> 33:53.461
For the sake of our history,
we must respect the rights of...

33:53.531 --> 33:54.463
Of the majority.

33:54.532 --> 33:55.464
Yes.

33:55.533 --> 33:56.795
What about the rights
of the minority?

33:56.901 --> 34:00.530
Tal... if those segments
come apart,

34:00.638 --> 34:02.697
there could be
decompressive explosions...

34:02.807 --> 34:04.468
most likely casualties.

34:04.542 --> 34:06.134
ls that what you want?

34:06.210 --> 34:09.145
You know more
about the parasites than we do.

34:09.213 --> 34:10.543
You could help us.

34:10.614 --> 34:11.877
Captain, she's a criminal.

34:12.016 --> 34:14.712
And maybe your only chance
of stopping a catastrophe.

34:14.786 --> 34:17.254
Set up a datalink with Voyager.

34:17.321 --> 34:19.380
We'll do what we can
from our end.

34:19.456 --> 34:21.118
Tal...

34:23.561 --> 34:25.426
l'll help you
slow down the parasites,

34:25.496 --> 34:27.793
so you can evacuate
the segments in danger...

34:27.864 --> 34:29.525
nothing more.

34:29.634 --> 34:31.101
Let's get started.

34:37.041 --> 34:37.938
Captain...

34:38.042 --> 34:39.031
Stow it, Ensign.

34:39.143 --> 34:40.770
Right now,
the only thing standing

34:40.844 --> 34:42.813
between you and the brig
is this report.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.279
The Doctor's bio-scans

34:44.348 --> 34:46.179
confirm that you and Tal
have developed

34:46.250 --> 34:47.649
some sort
of biochemical bond.

34:47.717 --> 34:49.447
Clearly, it's affected
your behavior,

34:49.520 --> 34:52.250
so l have to assume that's
why you disobeyed my orders.

34:52.322 --> 34:53.516
Report to Sick Bay.

34:53.591 --> 34:55.616
You'll be confined there
until this is over.

34:58.329 --> 34:59.296
Captain!

34:59.363 --> 35:00.887
l told you to report
for treatment!

35:01.032 --> 35:03.193
l don't want treatment!

35:03.301 --> 35:05.064
ln my ready room.

35:09.474 --> 35:10.668
You've got 30 seconds

35:10.741 --> 35:12.709
before l have Tuvok drag you
to Sick Bay.

35:12.777 --> 35:13.869
Captain, l am not sick.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.344
l didn't disobey your orders

35:15.413 --> 35:17.381
because l'm under
some alien influence.

35:17.448 --> 35:20.076
l disobeyed your orders
because Tal and l are in love,

35:20.151 --> 35:22.085
and it's not right
for you to keep us apart.

35:22.153 --> 35:23.586
Listen to yourself.

35:23.654 --> 35:25.884
You don't sound anything
like the Harry Kim l know.

35:25.990 --> 35:28.322
Good. l have served
on this ship for five years

35:28.392 --> 35:29.381
and said, ''yes, ma'am''

35:29.460 --> 35:31.018
to every one of your orders,
but not this time.

35:31.095 --> 35:32.585
You're willing
to risk your rank,

35:32.663 --> 35:34.961
your career over this?

35:37.001 --> 35:39.401
Have you ever been in love,
Captain?

35:39.470 --> 35:41.131
Your point?

35:41.239 --> 35:43.230
Did your skin ever flush

35:43.341 --> 35:45.275
when you were near
another person?

35:45.343 --> 35:47.937
Did your stomach
ever feel like someone

35:48.012 --> 35:49.138
hollowed it out with a knife

35:49.213 --> 35:50.942
when you were apart?

35:51.015 --> 35:54.280
Did your throat ever swell
when you realized it was over?

35:54.352 --> 35:56.081
Seven of Nine...

35:56.154 --> 35:58.884
Seven of Nine told me
love's like a disease.

35:58.956 --> 36:01.447
Well, maybe it is--
pheromones, endorphins,

36:01.559 --> 36:05.017
chemicals in our blood
changing our responses,

36:05.062 --> 36:07.189
physical discomfort,

36:07.265 --> 36:09.130
but any way you look
at it, it's still love.

36:09.233 --> 36:11.827
For the sake of argument,
let's say you're right.

36:11.936 --> 36:13.870
Your feelings for Tal
are no different

36:13.971 --> 36:15.370
than mine for-- what?

36:15.439 --> 36:17.270
The man l was engaged to marry?

36:17.341 --> 36:20.435
Well, l lost him,
and you're going to lose Tal.

36:20.511 --> 36:21.603
You know that.

36:21.679 --> 36:25.080
What the Doctor is offering you
is a way to ease the pain.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.153
That man you were
going to marry--

36:29.220 --> 36:32.519
if you could have
just taken a hypospray

36:32.590 --> 36:34.251
to make yourself stop loving him

36:34.325 --> 36:38.091
so that it didn't hurt so much
when you were away from him,

36:38.162 --> 36:40.960
would you have done that?

36:42.333 --> 36:43.698
Captain to the Bridge.

36:47.205 --> 36:50.732
We're detecting structural
breaches on the Varro ship.

36:50.841 --> 36:52.832
Take your station.

36:52.944 --> 36:56.038
Their shields are weakening.

36:56.113 --> 36:58.638
One of the junctions
is about to decompress.

36:58.716 --> 36:59.842
On screen.

37:03.187 --> 37:04.449
Mr. Paris, release
the docking clamps.

37:04.522 --> 37:06.456
Back us away.

37:06.524 --> 37:08.116
Docking controls are off-line.

37:08.192 --> 37:09.750
l can't break us free.

37:25.743 --> 37:27.574
Their shields
are continuing to weaken.

37:27.645 --> 37:29.010
The superstructure
will collapse

37:29.080 --> 37:30.604
in less than three minutes.

37:30.681 --> 37:32.376
lf that happens while
we're still docked...

37:32.450 --> 37:33.974
Keep trying to break free.

37:34.051 --> 37:36.019
Janeway to Varro control room.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.019
What's your status?

37:37.088 --> 37:38.851
Tal was able
to slow the parasites' growth

37:38.923 --> 37:40.083
with a polaron surge,

37:40.157 --> 37:42.057
but the junctions
are still destabilizing.

37:42.126 --> 37:44.993
How much longer until you've
evacuated the affected areas?

37:46.030 --> 37:47.861
We need another two minutes
at least.

37:47.932 --> 37:50.765
l've got the docking controls
back on line.

37:50.868 --> 37:52.335
lnitiate decompression sequence.

37:52.403 --> 37:54.303
Wait. lf we stay where we are,

37:54.372 --> 37:56.602
and extend Voyager's
structural integrity field

37:56.674 --> 37:57.698
around the Varro ship,

37:57.808 --> 37:59.207
we could buy them
another minute or two.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.801
They could finish
the evacuation.

38:00.911 --> 38:02.503
However,
if an explosion occurs

38:02.546 --> 38:04.173
while both ships
are inside the field,

38:04.248 --> 38:06.079
neither vessel will survive.

38:06.150 --> 38:07.777
We can do it, Captain.

38:09.320 --> 38:10.685
Keep us where we are.

38:10.755 --> 38:12.279
Janeway to Engineering.

38:12.356 --> 38:13.789
Torres here.

38:13.858 --> 38:16.383
Divert all available power
to the integrity field

38:16.460 --> 38:18.826
and extend it around
the Varro ship.

38:18.963 --> 38:20.157
Understood.

38:21.966 --> 38:24.400
Voyager is reinforcing
our shields.

38:24.502 --> 38:25.799
Surprising, isn't it?

38:25.903 --> 38:28.997
A ship of outsiders risking
their lives to save ours.

38:29.106 --> 38:30.630
They're unusual people.

38:30.741 --> 38:33.801
Or maybe the galaxy
isn't as hostile as you think.

38:33.878 --> 38:36.369
All junctions are clear.

38:38.449 --> 38:39.973
What are you waiting for?

38:40.051 --> 38:41.643
Tell Voyager to move away.

38:41.719 --> 38:43.880
l'm initiating
another polaron surge.

38:44.021 --> 38:45.886
We can destroy these parasites.

38:45.956 --> 38:47.218
lt's too late.

38:47.291 --> 38:49.589
You'll only destroy Voyager
along with our ship.

38:53.064 --> 38:54.895
Let them go.

38:55.032 --> 38:56.829
Let us go.

39:02.106 --> 39:03.403
Tal to Voyager.

39:03.474 --> 39:05.203
The evacuation's complete.

39:05.276 --> 39:09.372
Disengage your structural field
and move to a safe distance.

39:09.447 --> 39:11.745
Releasing docking clamps.

39:41.545 --> 39:43.240
Captain's Log, supplemental.

39:43.314 --> 39:46.078
Most of the Varro
have opted to stay together

39:46.150 --> 39:49.347
traveling in separate ships,
but the dissident group

39:49.420 --> 39:51.888
has been granted permission
to break away

39:52.022 --> 39:53.284
and find their own path.

39:53.357 --> 39:54.449
We wish them luck.

39:55.693 --> 39:56.921
Come in.

40:02.566 --> 40:04.693
l wasn't sure l'd see you again.

40:04.802 --> 40:07.168
The Captain gave me permission
to say good-bye.

40:07.238 --> 40:10.332
How are you feeling?

40:10.441 --> 40:12.534
Lovesick.

40:12.610 --> 40:14.601
Me, too.

40:14.678 --> 40:16.168
Will you manage?

40:18.215 --> 40:19.910
We have medications.

40:19.984 --> 40:22.544
l'll recover eventually.

40:25.990 --> 40:27.617
So, where are you going?

40:31.762 --> 40:33.855
The Natori system.

40:33.931 --> 40:38.061
A pair of binary stars
caught in each other's gravity.

40:38.169 --> 40:41.002
We passed within a parsec
three months ago,

40:41.138 --> 40:43.504
and now we're going
back for a real look.

40:43.574 --> 40:45.405
Do me one favor.

40:47.678 --> 40:49.168
Anything.

40:50.581 --> 40:54.608
Next time you run across
a class-3 nebula,

40:54.685 --> 40:56.414
think of me.

40:58.989 --> 41:02.550
Chronic sleep loss,
acute gastroenteritis--

41:02.660 --> 41:04.218
you must feel awful,

41:04.261 --> 41:07.059
yet you're still
refusing treatment?

41:07.131 --> 41:09.622
Captain, just the person
l wanted to see.

41:09.700 --> 41:11.429
This nonsense has
gone on long enough.

41:11.535 --> 41:13.002
Order Mr. Kim
to take his medicine.

41:13.103 --> 41:14.468
ls his condition fatal?

41:14.538 --> 41:15.937
That's hardly the point.

41:16.040 --> 41:18.099
Will he recover
without taking his medicine?

41:18.209 --> 41:20.575
Yes, but it could take weeks,
even months.

41:20.644 --> 41:24.136
Well, then, if Mr. Kim
wants to suffer...

41:25.616 --> 41:26.878
Sometimes l think
everyone on this ship

41:26.951 --> 41:29.112
has been possessed
by alien hormones.

41:29.186 --> 41:30.710
Would you excuse us, please?

41:33.691 --> 41:34.623
Thank you.

41:34.692 --> 41:35.716
Oh, don't thank me.

41:35.793 --> 41:38.091
l have no intention
of relieving you of your duties,

41:38.162 --> 41:39.288
no matter how lousy you feel.

41:39.363 --> 41:40.421
l understand.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.489
And the reprimand still stands.

41:46.036 --> 41:48.504
l've been thinking
about how l reacted

41:48.572 --> 41:50.563
to your relationship with Tal.

41:50.674 --> 41:54.872
You reacted
like any Captain would.

41:54.945 --> 41:58.005
Probably, but l
can't help wondering

41:58.082 --> 42:01.381
if my response would
have been the same

42:01.485 --> 42:05.387
if it had been, say,
Tom Paris instead of you.

42:05.422 --> 42:07.083
Oh, don't get me wrong.

42:07.157 --> 42:11.890
l still would have been
angry and disappointed, but...

42:11.962 --> 42:14.522
l wouldn't have been surprised.

42:14.598 --> 42:18.261
Because Ensign Kim
doesn't break the rules.

42:20.704 --> 42:24.071
The truth is, Harry...

42:24.141 --> 42:27.542
l think about you differently
than the rest of the crew.

42:27.611 --> 42:30.136
Which isn't to suggest
that l don't care

42:30.214 --> 42:32.273
deeply about each of them,
but...

42:32.349 --> 42:34.943
you came to me fresh
out of the Academy,

42:35.019 --> 42:36.714
wide-eyed with excitement

42:36.787 --> 42:39.381
about your first
deep space assignment.

42:39.456 --> 42:41.924
From that first day,
l've always felt

42:41.992 --> 42:44.654
more protective of you
than the others.

42:47.264 --> 42:49.459
l appreciate that...

42:49.533 --> 42:52.627
but that was five years ago.

42:54.672 --> 42:57.004
l've changed.

42:57.141 --> 42:59.109
Yes, you have.

43:00.477 --> 43:03.640
Maybe l'm not
the perfect officer anymore.

43:03.714 --> 43:06.012
Maybe not...

43:08.819 --> 43:11.287
but you're a better man.

43:25.035 --> 43:27.003
Last call.

43:28.138 --> 43:29.833
There's a bowl of soup
in storage,

43:29.940 --> 43:31.737
and l left
the replicator on line.

43:31.809 --> 43:33.401
Thanks.

43:33.477 --> 43:35.377
Good night.

43:41.819 --> 43:43.582
Oh, l was just closing
up for the evening,

43:43.654 --> 43:44.780
but if you need anything...

43:44.855 --> 43:46.117
l'm here to see Ensign Kim.

43:46.190 --> 43:48.658
Oh. Good luck.

43:53.631 --> 43:54.757
Ensign.

43:54.832 --> 43:55.992
Hmm?

43:57.267 --> 43:59.235
Thank you.

43:59.336 --> 44:00.598
For what?

44:00.704 --> 44:01.830
You completed several

44:01.905 --> 44:03.930
of my astrometric scans
this morning.

44:04.041 --> 44:05.440
You're welcome.

44:05.509 --> 44:08.307
l had some time
between duty shifts.

44:08.379 --> 44:10.745
Besides, it kept me occupied.

44:10.814 --> 44:13.282
You are attempting
to distract yourself

44:13.350 --> 44:15.113
from your emotional damage.

44:15.185 --> 44:17.449
l wish l could say
it was working.

44:17.521 --> 44:20.388
A treatment to relieve
your condition was available

44:20.457 --> 44:22.322
and yet you refused.

44:22.393 --> 44:24.190
l've got a disease,

44:24.261 --> 44:26.889
but l'm willing
to live with the symptoms.

44:26.997 --> 44:28.589
Doesn't make much sense does it?

44:32.236 --> 44:35.763
l assumed that romantic love
was a human weakness,

44:35.873 --> 44:39.240
but clearly it can also be
a source of strength.

44:40.611 --> 44:43.205
Perhaps my analogy was flawed.

44:43.280 --> 44:45.248
Love is not a disease.

44:48.285 --> 44:50.446
Get well soon.
