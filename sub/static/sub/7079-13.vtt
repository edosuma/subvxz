00:06.548 --> 00:08.175
School's out, bitches!

00:11.220 --> 00:13.055
Congratulations, Greendale students.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.974
We've pulled off another year
and we're still standing.

00:16.265 --> 00:18.435
Take that, health inspector,
building inspector,

00:18.727 --> 00:22.189
foundation inspector, water
line inspector, geologist,

00:22.481 --> 00:25.234
exterminator, plumber, and dad.

00:32.156 --> 00:35.994
Whoo-hoo!

00:44.836 --> 00:45.837
Abed.

00:47.214 --> 00:48.215
Why bring a metronome?

00:49.841 --> 00:51.694
I thought the sound might
accentuate the anxious idleness

00:51.718 --> 00:53.118
of our last meeting's
final seconds.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.055
Good job. Bad idea.
Okay, that is done.

00:55.347 --> 00:56.348
Yeah! Whoo!

00:56.640 --> 00:57.640
There's more.

00:57.724 --> 01:00.143
This one is exciting.

01:00.435 --> 01:03.355
We have to rename
the Save Greendale Committee

01:03.647 --> 01:07.067
due to the fact that Greendale
is done being saved.

01:10.279 --> 01:12.072
You think that's more
exciting than summer?

01:12.364 --> 01:14.199
Oh, am I stealing
your rays, dude?

01:14.491 --> 01:15.867
Come on, it's neat.

01:16.159 --> 01:19.162
Our mission is finally
accomplished, once and for all.

01:19.454 --> 01:20.734
So what do we call
ourselves now?

01:20.831 --> 01:22.541
The Accomplishers.
The Obsoletists.

01:22.833 --> 01:23.993
Stephen King's Dreamcatchers.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.419
Susan.

01:25.711 --> 01:27.397
You guys are rebelling against
yourselves, you get that, right?

01:27.421 --> 01:29.965
The current trend in branding
is unique, simplistic,

01:30.257 --> 01:32.175
phonetically memorable
gibberish.

01:32.467 --> 01:33.594
How about Nippledippers?

01:33.885 --> 01:35.095
I like Nippledippers.

01:35.387 --> 01:36.972
- You guys...
- Okay.

01:37.264 --> 01:38.664
Ooh, Nippledippers.com
is available.

01:38.932 --> 01:39.975
Grab that mother. Done.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.936
Nippledippers, listen up.
Text from the Dean.

01:43.228 --> 01:45.647
"Don't leave yet,
I'm almost there."

01:45.939 --> 01:46.940
"Special celebration."

01:47.232 --> 01:48.472
"Just finished entire semester"

01:48.567 --> 01:51.236
"without wearing
a single silly outfit."

01:51.528 --> 01:52.654
Ah.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.656
I hadn't even noticed.
Good for him.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.784
Uh-oh. Oh, ah.

02:00.037 --> 02:02.080
Hey, everybody.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.915
I made it.

02:04.207 --> 02:06.488
Obviously, I binged pretty hard
there after the bell rang,

02:06.543 --> 02:09.295
but I made it.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.482
Are you guys going out to
celebrate or something?

02:11.506 --> 02:12.841
Maybe I'll tag along.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.853
It's been a tough year.
I could use a drink.

02:14.926 --> 02:16.206
We were gonna go to Britta's bar

02:16.428 --> 02:19.806
whenever Mother Time
is willing to call it a year.

02:20.098 --> 02:21.141
Okay, fine, we're done!

02:21.433 --> 02:22.433
Happy summer. All right!

02:22.684 --> 02:23.769
Whoo!

02:24.061 --> 02:25.812
Nippledippers drink for free!

02:26.104 --> 02:27.540
I'll pay for my drinks. I'm
not acknowledging that title.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.000
Someone owes me 10 bucks
for the domain.

02:29.024 --> 02:30.734
I won't be able to join you.

02:31.026 --> 02:32.778
I got to get
on the road to California.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.230
I got a job through Linkedln.

02:34.363 --> 02:36.698
What? That's crazy.

02:36.990 --> 02:37.990
People use Linkedln?

02:38.158 --> 02:39.409
No. Linkedln hired me

02:39.701 --> 02:41.137
to help figure out
why people don't use it.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.788
Also, I have an old lady-friend

02:43.080 --> 02:45.749
I went to high school with who
just became unmarried last week,

02:46.041 --> 02:47.185
and I thought I'd look her up.

02:47.209 --> 02:49.127
Wow, you work fast.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.046
Or actually, very slow.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.298
Either way, good luck. Are
you coming back, Elroy?

02:54.091 --> 02:55.467
I think so.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.303
Probably.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.014
Maybe.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.100

have to start on a billiard shot?

03:42.764 --> 03:44.604
Or do you think every time
someone takes a shot

03:44.766 --> 03:46.411
in billiards, they start a new
bar scene without knowing it?

03:46.435 --> 03:48.520
What? You can just
say, "Shut up, Abed."

03:48.812 --> 03:50.522
Okay, ask me if I'm coming back.

03:50.814 --> 03:52.566
Uh, are you coming back?

Yeah.

Probably. Maybe.

03:56.862 --> 03:58.488
I mean, what was that, right?

03:58.780 --> 03:59.823
That was an Irish goodbye.

04:00.115 --> 04:01.491
Let's give it an Irish wake.

but she's the only

She said she had an interview.

04:11.376 --> 04:12.461
Six years.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.379
Six seasons, right, Abed?

04:14.671 --> 04:16.711
Don't put a nickel in him.
Stop mitigating everyone.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.009
So, Abed, what happens
in season seven?

04:19.301 --> 04:20.802
Oh, man.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.346
I don't know how likely
season seven is.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.478
I mean, what show ever
peaked after season six?

04:25.599 --> 04:27.809
Simpsons, Seinfeld,
South Park, Friends.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.079
Those shows weren't hemorrhaging
characters every year.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.938
Oh, I don't like
that word, hemorrhaging.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.442
I'll see what I can do?

04:35.734 --> 04:36.902
What if Shirley came back?

04:37.194 --> 04:38.504
Would that change
your disposition?

04:38.528 --> 04:39.839
Shirley could get us
back on formula

04:39.863 --> 04:41.174
but I don't see
it turning us around.

04:41.198 --> 04:42.741

04:53.794 --> 04:55.086
My setup lacks awareness.

04:55.378 --> 04:56.963
But my punchline doesn't know.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.507
Abusively cynical one-liner

04:58.799 --> 05:00.109
dismissing everything
you just said.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.260
Absurd reaction!

05:02.552 --> 05:04.471
You guys, can we put
in a pin in the B story

05:04.763 --> 05:06.014
and focus on the A story?

05:06.306 --> 05:08.034
I don't trust A stories.
Never have, never will.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.768
I had a setup about a story

05:10.060 --> 05:11.621
that was so placeholder, the
punchline came five words early.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.772
And I can tag it, too. Ooh.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.784

from here until eternity.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.857
Yeah, see? Shirley, no Shirley,
what does it matter, right?

05:39.881 --> 05:41.174
Abed, we're not formulas.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.468
And if I had no self-awareness,
I think I'd know.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.904
Things have a certain
structure to them, you know?

05:44.928 --> 05:46.197
If we stray from it,
we're weird.

05:46.221 --> 05:47.931
If we stick to it, we're boring.

05:48.223 --> 05:50.034
Yeah, but isn't that more about
the shape of your brain, Abed?

05:50.058 --> 05:51.601
I mean, no offense or anything,

05:51.893 --> 05:54.688
but isn't the shape of your
brain kind of fucked up?

is that everyone is nice and
has fun and grows together.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.569
Lots of things can be forced.

09:29.861 --> 09:33.031
Like a human head through
a six inch drainpipe.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.659
What? I'm just kidding, pal.

09:36.951 --> 09:39.329
Okay, did anyone on the
Sustain Greendale Committee

09:39.621 --> 09:41.372
do any of their
assignments this week?

09:41.664 --> 09:42.749
Scrunch?

09:43.041 --> 09:44.375
Sorry, bro.
I don't work for you.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.503
You work for me.

09:46.795 --> 09:48.856
I'm the tech billionaire that bought
this dump and cuts your paycheck.

09:48.880 --> 09:52.675
If you can call that a paycheck. I've
seen more zeroes over Pearl Harbor.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.262
There were hundreds of 'em.

09:56.554 --> 10:00.100
The sky was black
with smoke and bombs.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.729
Double-click this, Winger.
It's your job to work.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.231
It is our job to party.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.566
And hatch hare-brained schemes.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.402
And get laid. And get laid!

10:11.694 --> 10:13.738
And eventually leave
you here as well.

10:17.534 --> 10:18.576
Jeff, you okay?

10:18.868 --> 10:21.996
Huh? Oh, uh, I was taken aback.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.288
It's big news.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.669
What have you guys been doing?

10:27.961 --> 10:33.133
We were just looking for ways
to make season seven work.

10:33.424 --> 10:34.784
I mean, we got
through six seasons.

10:35.051 --> 10:37.029
I mean, what's up with that?
I mean, where's season seven?

10:37.053 --> 10:38.721
We got to figure out
season seven.

10:39.013 --> 10:41.391
Or maybe we could just hang out.

10:57.407 --> 10:58.607
it made the Insane Clown Posse

10:58.867 --> 11:00.994
look like the Well-Adjusted
Clown Posse.

people like you. Thank you.

11:08.251 --> 11:11.411
I don't know if I can keep making the
commute from here to the FBI Headquarters.

11:11.546 --> 11:13.965
Britta, Abed,
I'll have to move back in.

11:14.257 --> 11:15.258
I moved in with them.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.969
Chang, we have files.
Moving out.

11:18.261 --> 11:19.512
You seem stressed, Annie.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.574
Are those last few
criminology credits you need

11:21.598 --> 11:23.141
hard to get at Greendale?
Please.

11:23.433 --> 11:25.452
The only credit hard to get
at Greendale is from a bank.

11:25.476 --> 11:28.062
It's just, they have schools
for this stuff at Quantico.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.981
Being with you guys is great,

11:30.273 --> 11:32.483
but why is this
a good choice for me?

11:32.775 --> 11:34.861
Why doesn't the audience
feel sorry for me?

11:35.153 --> 11:37.238
Britta, your parents
have been murdered.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.890
By whom?
The police won't touch it.

11:39.157 --> 11:40.557
They're calling
it a double suicide.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.619
Britta, I got this.

11:45.246 --> 11:46.789
You're proposing a version
of the show

11:47.081 --> 11:49.959
in which Annie comes back and it
hinges on the murder of my parents?

11:50.251 --> 11:51.251
It's a placeholder.

11:51.502 --> 11:52.742
I'm just saying, there's always

11:52.795 --> 11:54.547
gonna be a need
for law at Greendale.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.159

11:56.341 --> 11:59.886
Yeah.

12:00.178 --> 12:03.306
Do I re... I mean,
doesn't everybody?

12:03.598 --> 12:04.867
Could've been anybody.
This diaper thing?

12:04.891 --> 12:06.351
What is it with
this diaper thing?

12:06.643 --> 12:08.269
Is it about shaming me?

12:08.561 --> 12:10.414
Do you really want a bunch
of people dressing you?

12:10.438 --> 12:11.981
It would be polite to try.

12:12.273 --> 12:13.542
It's nice to see you interested
in this stuff, Jeff,

12:13.566 --> 12:15.252
but I wouldn't watch that season.
Me neither.

to call us terrorists

12:28.957 --> 12:30.517

to international waters,

12:30.541 --> 12:34.337

guess this is fucking war.

12:34.629 --> 12:36.429
Annie, I'm gonna
need you to go to Washington.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.049
I'm scared.
Be more scared than that.

12:38.341 --> 12:39.661
Britta, the protestors
are scared.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.042
They need you to talk to them.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.929
They should be scared,

12:43.221 --> 12:44.698
but they shouldn't need a
leader to tell them what to do.

12:44.722 --> 12:48.059
We're all born free
into a world of lies.

12:48.351 --> 12:49.828
But let's talk about you
for a second though.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.562
Well, I'm not a joke anymore.

12:51.854 --> 12:54.148
I'm strictly transgender.
I'm not all this other stuff.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.484
I represent the transgender
community,

12:56.776 --> 12:57.944

"All this other stuff?"

13:03.408 --> 13:04.510
Glad to be of service, Britta.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.035
I want my diaper back.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.138
I don't even own a TV,
and I wouldn't watch that.

13:08.162 --> 13:09.497
Oh, yeah? What's your pitch?

13:09.789 --> 13:14.043
Oh, well, I-I mean, it's not
that complicated, is it?

13:28.182 --> 13:29.559

Hello. How's everyone?

13:31.352 --> 13:32.812
Hello. I have...

13:33.104 --> 13:35.231
We could learn
about science or history.

13:35.523 --> 13:36.803
It's set in a school, after all.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.067
Why aren't we learning?

13:40.403 --> 13:42.947
And I know that's
not enough, so...

13:46.117 --> 13:47.117
And so on.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.120
Boo!

13:49.412 --> 13:51.914
It's possible there is more
skill to it than I thought.

13:52.206 --> 13:54.083
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- There is skill to it.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.711
More importantly,
it has to be joyful.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.003
Effortless.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.630
Fun.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.026
TV defeats its own purpose
when it's pushing an agenda

14:02.050 --> 14:03.801
or trying to defeat other TV,

14:04.093 --> 14:07.013
or being proud or ashamed
of itself for existing.

14:07.305 --> 14:08.306
It's TV.

14:08.598 --> 14:10.266
It's comfort.

14:10.558 --> 14:14.145
It's a friend you've
known so well and for so long.

14:14.437 --> 14:16.189
You just let it be with you.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.779
or phone in a day.

14:23.071 --> 14:24.506
And it needs to be okay
for it to get on a boat

14:24.530 --> 14:26.449

interact with you than a stupid committee.

- Ah.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.058
But I'm grown up and I'm hot,

15:34.350 --> 15:35.726
but not little girl hot.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.371
And I'm happy
and we're all together

15:37.395 --> 15:38.688

Am I on meds in it?

16:07.550 --> 16:09.427
I'm mellow and relatable.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.247
I would love
to teach at Greendale.

16:12.388 --> 16:13.764

16:14.056 --> 16:15.492
Once you swallow the horse
pill-sized contrivance,

16:15.516 --> 16:17.310

16:25.151 --> 16:26.591
Well, I should probably
tell you guys

16:26.652 --> 16:27.892

in saying no to an idea,

to commit, I have to pass.

19:21.619 --> 19:25.748
Well, I want to live in the
same home for more than a year,

19:26.040 --> 19:28.626
order wine
without feeling nervous,

19:28.918 --> 19:33.839
have a resume full of crazy
mistakes instead of crazy lies.

19:34.131 --> 19:37.718
I want stories and wisdom,
perspective,

19:38.010 --> 19:39.387
I want to have so much behind me

19:39.679 --> 19:41.847
I'm not a slave
to what's in front of me.

19:42.139 --> 19:44.892
Especially these...

19:45.184 --> 19:47.561
flavorless, unremarkable
Marvel movies.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.522
They are so not a big deal!
I know!

19:49.814 --> 19:50.856
It's just all there is.

19:51.148 --> 19:52.983
Yes! And you get to say that!

19:53.275 --> 19:54.555
I could screw myself
if I say it,

19:54.694 --> 19:57.863
but there's pressures on me
you don't have to live under.

19:58.155 --> 20:01.992
If you accept that you're older.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.619
And let the kid stuff go.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.206
I let you go, Annie.

20:07.498 --> 20:09.792
With my hands, and my head.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.795
The heart,

20:13.087 --> 20:17.341
which cynics say is code for
penis, wants what it wants.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.011
But I let you go.

20:29.437 --> 20:31.105
The others are coming,

20:31.397 --> 20:34.316
so I think you should
kiss me good-bye

20:34.608 --> 20:36.528
or you might regret it
for the rest of your life.

20:36.777 --> 20:37.862
What about you?

20:38.154 --> 20:39.530
I'll regret the kiss for a week.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.824
I'm in my 20s. Who cares?

21:01.886 --> 21:05.097
Ooh, are we interrupting?

21:05.389 --> 21:06.432
Stop being gross.

21:06.724 --> 21:07.951
Are you guys doing an
unauthorized finale in here?

21:07.975 --> 21:09.059
Not cool.

21:09.351 --> 21:10.631
Abed,
I know it gives you comfort

21:10.686 --> 21:12.286
to see everything
through that meta lens,

21:12.438 --> 21:16.025
but we were just saying
good-bye to the room.

21:16.317 --> 21:17.317
For season six.

21:17.359 --> 21:18.694
Season seven, who knows?

21:18.986 --> 21:21.030
It's out of our hands.
Too many variables.

21:21.322 --> 21:22.322
Cool. Cool, cool.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.074
Cool, cool.

21:24.366 --> 21:25.534
Cool.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.454
That was one cool
for each season.

21:28.746 --> 21:30.539
Wait, do it again,
I want to try something.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.082
Cool. Cool, cool. Cool.

21:32.374 --> 21:33.667
Oh.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.419
Cool, cool.

21:35.711 --> 21:37.087
I farted during the fourth one.

21:37.379 --> 21:38.380
It's an inside joke.

21:38.672 --> 21:40.007
I'm gonna miss you guys. Gay.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.818
You know what I think
everybody should do?

21:41.842 --> 21:43.722
As a humble outsider
that came in and nailed it,

21:43.803 --> 21:47.097
I think everyone should imagine
their own personal version

21:47.389 --> 21:49.725
of season seven
and not share it with anyone

21:50.017 --> 21:51.257
and then maybe it'll come true.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.394
No cutting to any of them.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.126
If you cut to it,
it won't come true.

22:07.701 --> 22:11.038
You just stopped being
a study group.

22:11.330 --> 22:15.125
I hereby pronounce you
a community.

22:15.417 --> 22:17.211
Brianna,
you're the driven idealist.

22:17.503 --> 22:19.129
Kaylee, you're the fiery,
passionate one.

22:19.421 --> 22:21.006
We might have a fun
no-stringsy thing.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.133
And Mackenzie, the kooky,
nerdy one.

22:23.425 --> 22:25.010
And Hallie, the other nerdy one.

22:25.302 --> 22:27.462
You guys should be best friends
and have pillow fights.

22:27.638 --> 22:29.098
And there's Phoebe,
the wise one.

22:29.390 --> 22:30.683
No? You're nerdy too?

22:30.975 --> 22:32.226
Okay.

22:32.518 --> 22:34.061
And the rest of you
other redhead ones,

22:34.353 --> 22:37.314
and we're gonna
have some pretty crazy times.

22:37.606 --> 22:41.026
And eventually, you'll leave
and be replaced by new ones,

22:41.318 --> 22:43.487
and that's something
I'm equipped to handle now.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.030
I'm sort of a hero that way.

22:46.949 --> 22:49.577
We can cut to them at home
though, right?

22:49.869 --> 22:51.328
I mean, by ourselves? Sure.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.163
I love that I got
to be with you guys.

22:53.455 --> 22:55.332
Gay. You saved my life

22:55.624 --> 22:56.624
and changed it forever.

22:56.709 --> 22:57.793
Gay!

22:58.085 --> 22:59.420
Thank you.

23:10.055 --> 23:12.892
I'm gay.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.521
I'm for real gay.

23:19.690 --> 23:21.942
I'm legit gay!

This is the show. Right? Right.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.149
Community!

24:44.441 --> 24:45.985
The hit show
is now a hit board game.

24:46.276 --> 24:48.236
- More like an I'm bored game.
- Shut up, Leonard.

24:48.487 --> 24:52.533
You look like a German puppet maker and
smell like the inside of a church.

24:52.825 --> 24:53.951
Blah, blah, blah,

24:54.243 --> 24:56.083
commercial VO describing
the rules of gameplay.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.205
I like you, Winger. As a friend.

24:58.497 --> 24:59.999
Ooh. Ooh, snap.

25:00.290 --> 25:03.544
Sorry, Britta, but that
friendship just got a benefit.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.436
Collect all
the other players' identities

25:05.462 --> 25:08.549
and be the first to figure out if
the game is part of the show or...

25:08.841 --> 25:11.218
I got it. The whole show is
happening inside this game.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.512
Then explain this.

25:16.306 --> 25:17.850
What is it?

25:18.142 --> 25:22.187
It's a script of a fake
commercial at the end

25:22.479 --> 25:26.025
of season six starring
this family.

25:26.316 --> 25:27.526
Sorry, Dad.

25:27.818 --> 25:29.111
Guess I win.

25:30.738 --> 25:32.698
You stupid child.

25:32.990 --> 25:34.199
Nobody's winning anything.

25:34.491 --> 25:36.535
Don't you see?

25:36.827 --> 25:39.538
This means we don't exist.

25:39.830 --> 25:43.000
We're not created by God.
We're created by a joke.

25:43.292 --> 25:47.254
We were never born and we
will never actually live.

25:55.304 --> 25:56.944
Dice not included,
some assembly required.

25:57.222 --> 25:58.766
Lines between
perception, desire,

25:59.058 --> 26:00.869
and reality may become blurred,
redundant, or interchangeable.

26:00.893 --> 26:03.413
Characters may hook up with no regard
for your emotional investment.

26:03.437 --> 26:05.037
Some episodes
too conceptual to be funny,

26:05.064 --> 26:06.207
some too funny to be immersive,

26:06.231 --> 26:07.959
and some so immersive
they still aren't funny.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.335
Consistency between
seasons may vary.

26:09.359 --> 26:10.879
Viewers may be measured
by a secretive,

26:10.986 --> 26:12.786
obsolete system based
on selected participants

26:12.863 --> 26:14.424
keeping hand written journals
of what they watch.

26:14.448 --> 26:16.283
Show may be canceled
and moved to the internet

26:16.575 --> 26:18.303
where it turns out tens of millions were
watching the whole time, may not matter.

26:18.327 --> 26:19.971
Fake commercial may end
with disclaimer gag

26:19.995 --> 26:21.723
which may descend
into vain, Chuck Lorre-esquei

26:21.747 --> 26:22.987
rant by a narcissistic creator.

26:23.165 --> 26:24.851
Creator may be unstable.
Therapist may have told creator,

26:24.875 --> 26:26.686
"This is not how you make
yourself a good person."

26:26.710 --> 26:28.855
Life may pass by while we ignore
or mistreat those closest to us.

26:28.879 --> 26:30.356
Those closest to us
may be those watching.

26:30.380 --> 26:31.566
Those people may
want to know I love them,

26:31.590 --> 26:32.990
but I may be incapable
of saying it.

26:33.133 --> 26:35.135
Contains pieces the size
of a child's esophagus.

27:10.629 --> 27:11.672
Did you get any of that?
