WEBVTT

00:03.639 --> 00:04.999
Director Hirst.

00:05.024 --> 00:06.498
Hi, Stuart.

00:08.458 --> 00:10.043
- She killed Stuart.
- We gotta take her down.

00:10.068 --> 00:12.534
You will revoke Zapata's FBI clearance.

00:12.996 --> 00:14.409
I'll testify against her.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.074

00:23.424 --> 00:24.457
<i>It's done.</i>

00:24.525 --> 00:25.725
<i>Van Gogh is dead.</i>

00:44.879 --> 00:46.112
I'll do you the courtesy

00:46.180 --> 00:48.214
of assuming this is very important.

00:48.282 --> 00:49.358
<i>It is.</i>

00:49.383 --> 00:52.347
I'm... doing everything in my power

00:52.372 --> 00:54.213
to protect your interests
and move things forward,

00:54.237 --> 00:56.726
but my position at the Bureau

00:56.751 --> 00:58.057
is becoming untenable.

00:58.125 --> 01:00.727
I'm under direct threat
from some of my own people.

01:00.794 --> 01:03.067
- So handle them.
- <i>I'm about to.</i>

01:03.220 --> 01:05.632
But should something go awry,

01:05.699 --> 01:08.081
I'd like your assurance that you'll do

01:08.106 --> 01:11.341
everything in your power to protect me.

01:11.409 --> 01:12.700
Well, how about this?

01:12.725 --> 01:14.232
How about you do everything you can

01:14.257 --> 01:15.326
to get out from under this,

01:15.351 --> 01:17.376
but if you can't, then you make sure

01:17.401 --> 01:19.502
you have an exit strategy
that doesn't involve me,

01:19.583 --> 01:21.635
<i>because I will do
everything to find you</i>

01:21.660 --> 01:22.940
<i>and make sure no one ever learns</i>

01:22.965 --> 01:23.969
<i>of our connection.</i>

01:23.994 --> 01:25.420
But I would never betray...

01:25.445 --> 01:27.405
You're very useful to me
in your current position.

01:27.503 --> 01:29.295
Lose it and you become a liability.

01:29.340 --> 01:32.049
I think you know
how I feel about those.

01:34.565 --> 01:36.468
Remove this threat...

01:36.767 --> 01:38.801
or you've got a bigger one coming.

01:53.720 --> 01:55.425
- Hello?
<i>- Where are you?</i>

01:55.450 --> 01:56.518
At the office. Why?

01:56.543 --> 01:58.003
<i>Van Gogh was shot by a sniper</i>

01:58.028 --> 01:59.837
<i>at the safe house, and he's dead.</i>

01:59.991 --> 02:01.188
<i>Hirst knows everything.</i>

02:01.213 --> 02:02.647
Hi, Edgar.

02:03.140 --> 02:04.758
Everything all right?

02:07.224 --> 02:10.387
Uh, actually, I'm a little concerned.

02:11.288 --> 02:12.581
I, uh...

02:12.850 --> 02:14.173
I took Tasha off the task force

02:14.198 --> 02:15.571
and stripped her of her FBI clearance,

02:15.596 --> 02:17.321
like you suggested...
I didn't want to wait.

02:17.608 --> 02:18.774
But now I'm starting to think

02:18.799 --> 02:20.333
the team might be into something.

02:20.777 --> 02:22.110
Like what?

02:22.281 --> 02:23.677
That I don't know yet.

02:23.758 --> 02:24.921
We used to tell each other everything,

02:24.946 --> 02:26.546
and now they're hiding
something from me.

02:26.571 --> 02:27.621
I hate to say it,

02:27.646 --> 02:29.680
but they might be compromised.

02:30.371 --> 02:31.771
Have you seen anything unusual?

02:32.097 --> 02:35.434
Well, I know you've
always been close to them,

02:35.610 --> 02:36.674
but, frankly,

02:36.699 --> 02:39.167
there's nothing about
the Jane Doe task force

02:39.192 --> 02:42.927
that seems anything but unusual to me.

02:43.230 --> 02:45.400
I'm sorry to bring something like
this to you without any proof.

02:45.425 --> 02:47.011
I just don't know who else I can trust.

02:47.036 --> 02:48.670
You did the right thing.

02:48.695 --> 02:50.206
I trust your instincts.

02:50.231 --> 02:51.896
If anyone could sense something off

02:51.921 --> 02:53.736
with these people, it'd be you,

02:53.761 --> 02:55.828
but until we know what it is,

02:55.916 --> 02:59.052
I suggest we watch each other's backs.

02:59.542 --> 03:00.861
Deal?

03:02.082 --> 03:03.408
Deal.

03:08.025 --> 03:09.412
All right, does anyone
think they were followed?

03:09.437 --> 03:10.797
No, but I'm getting a little tired

03:10.822 --> 03:12.340
of taking five subways to get here.

03:13.878 --> 03:15.768
How the hell are we
supposed to catch this woman

03:15.793 --> 03:16.834
when she keeps murdering

03:16.859 --> 03:18.459
all the people that could
help put her away?

03:18.484 --> 03:20.699
Maybe we can take what we know
to the Justice Department,

03:20.724 --> 03:21.979
see if it's enough to build a case.

03:22.004 --> 03:23.349
What do we have?

03:23.374 --> 03:24.741
Circumstantial evidence,

03:24.808 --> 03:26.709
inadmissible testimony from a dead man.

03:26.777 --> 03:28.430
I mean, if we play our cards now,

03:28.455 --> 03:29.822
Hirst will destroy us.

03:29.847 --> 03:31.616
Weller's right. I'm frustrated, too,

03:31.641 --> 03:32.691
but until we get her dead to rights,

03:32.716 --> 03:34.117
all we can do is go in,

03:34.185 --> 03:35.962
stand right next to her,
and keep doing our jobs

03:35.986 --> 03:37.106
like it's business as usual.

03:37.130 --> 03:38.421
I think she still trusts me.

03:38.489 --> 03:41.082
All right. Just be careful, all right?

03:41.107 --> 03:42.207
It's gonna be very useful

03:42.275 --> 03:43.475
keeping you that close to her.

03:43.510 --> 03:45.072
It's a dangerous position to be in.

03:45.097 --> 03:46.537
As long as Hirst is running the FBI,

03:46.562 --> 03:47.980
we're all in danger.

03:48.005 --> 03:49.565
It looks like it's my time to check in.

03:49.975 --> 03:51.223
It won't be the same without you.

03:51.312 --> 03:52.912
I know.

03:54.587 --> 03:55.871
Good luck.

03:59.359 --> 04:01.460
<i>I served you Van Gogh on a platter,</i>

04:01.494 --> 04:04.296
so why is Eleanor Hirst
still director of the FBI?

04:04.364 --> 04:05.654
Why don't you just stop playing games

04:05.679 --> 04:06.767
and tell me what you want?

04:06.792 --> 04:08.107
Playtime's over.

04:08.161 --> 04:11.130
You need to take her out
yourself, permanently.

04:11.237 --> 04:13.128
I am a federal agent.

04:13.318 --> 04:15.399
I am not murdering
someone in cold blood.

04:15.424 --> 04:17.161
<i>We can still take her down
the right way.</i>

04:17.185 --> 04:20.366
No. You needed Van Gogh's
testimony for that.

04:20.512 --> 04:22.263
I spent over a year
perfecting this plan,

04:22.288 --> 04:23.755
and you screwed it up in a day.

04:23.950 --> 04:25.150
The only way she goes down now

04:25.185 --> 04:26.313
is with a bullet,

04:26.346 --> 04:28.473
<i>or I tell Jane the truth about Berlin.</i>

04:29.048 --> 04:30.649
- Jane Doe.
- How do you know Jane?

04:30.674 --> 04:31.874
She's my mother.

04:32.699 --> 04:34.199
Hey.

04:34.687 --> 04:36.087
- Hey.
- Who was that?

04:37.397 --> 04:38.497
Roman.

04:38.565 --> 04:39.865
Why is he calling you?

04:39.933 --> 04:41.934
He's just trying to mess with my head.

04:42.337 --> 04:43.538
Pull us apart.

04:43.605 --> 04:45.690
There's nothing he can do
to get between us.

04:45.754 --> 04:48.856
I have to meet Patterson.
We'll talk more later.

04:52.588 --> 04:55.456
I ordered your coffee.

04:57.446 --> 04:59.814
Tom, is everything okay?

04:59.869 --> 05:01.933
Yeah. Yeah, just, uh...

05:02.197 --> 05:03.639
just a job that fell through.

05:03.686 --> 05:05.854
I wouldn't think a man who bids $20,000

05:05.879 --> 05:07.029
on a child's wish bracelet

05:07.054 --> 05:09.088
would worry about gainful employment.

05:09.204 --> 05:10.971
It's not about the money.

05:11.333 --> 05:13.168
It'd just be nice to have
a greater sense of purpose

05:13.193 --> 05:14.727
than writing checks.

05:14.817 --> 05:18.152
Sorry. You don't need to hear
about my nouveau riche crisis.

05:18.934 --> 05:21.502
I'm the one who should apologize.

05:21.703 --> 05:23.037
I begged you to stay on here,

05:23.079 --> 05:25.973
and I've completely
abandoned you to work.

05:26.103 --> 05:27.543
Well, today's gonna be all about us.

05:27.568 --> 05:28.939
How does that sound?

05:29.592 --> 05:31.273
Perfect.

05:37.158 --> 05:39.702
We just confiscated this
from a known hitman.

05:39.795 --> 05:42.096
He's no longer alive
to give us the password.

05:42.121 --> 05:43.521
I need you to crack it.

05:43.706 --> 05:44.906
Why didn't you ask Patterson?

05:44.931 --> 05:46.298
Because I'm asking you.

05:46.802 --> 05:48.366
Don't forget you're out of prison

05:48.391 --> 05:50.130
because you've proved
yourself valuable.

05:50.155 --> 05:52.222
You stop proving that,
I'll send you right back.

05:52.567 --> 05:54.201
Like I said, not a problem.

05:55.404 --> 05:56.771
We have got a problem.

05:56.812 --> 05:58.208
I just cracked this laptop for Hirst,

05:58.233 --> 06:00.038
which was insultingly easy, by the way,

06:00.063 --> 06:01.812
and it is just chock-full of documents

06:01.837 --> 06:03.633
pointing at Patterson
for Stuart's murder

06:03.699 --> 06:05.619
and the assassination
of this Van Gogh character.

06:05.688 --> 06:08.123
Just to be clear, you didn't actually
kill these people, right?

06:08.148 --> 06:09.876
What? No. No.

06:10.192 --> 06:11.506
Hirst did that, not me.

06:11.547 --> 06:12.683
Wait. Hirst? What?

06:12.708 --> 06:14.308
That is... actually kind of badass.

06:14.576 --> 06:16.344
So Hirst knows
that we're getting close.

06:16.369 --> 06:18.003
And she's framed you for all of this.

06:18.028 --> 06:19.495
She's done a damn good job.

06:19.615 --> 06:22.050
This looks bad.
This looks very, very bad.

06:22.210 --> 06:23.778
Okay, just tell her you can't crack it.

06:23.825 --> 06:25.559
Buy us time to prove
the evidence is false.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.773
Can't crack it? I'm an ex-cyber felon.

06:27.983 --> 06:30.254
The FBI logs and reviews
everything I do in my office.

06:30.299 --> 06:32.210
It is only a matter of time
before somebody sees this

06:32.281 --> 06:33.997
and sounds the alarm.
She could be here any second.

06:34.022 --> 06:35.590
Okay, then we let Hirst arrest her.

06:35.777 --> 06:37.176
The rest of us can still find proof

06:37.201 --> 06:39.116
that she's the guilty one
and take her down.

06:39.141 --> 06:41.068
No! She's too dangerous.

06:41.093 --> 06:43.401
Hirst put a bullet in Van Gogh
before he could testify.

06:43.447 --> 06:44.932
She put a knife into Stuart

06:44.957 --> 06:46.151
before he could tell us the truth.

06:46.176 --> 06:48.485
I mean, she is ruthless,
and she has a building

06:48.510 --> 06:50.332
full of agents that are
completely loyal to her.

06:50.357 --> 06:51.801
If you get taken into custody,

06:51.826 --> 06:53.260
you're as good as dead.

06:53.769 --> 06:55.684
Then we take down Hirst today,

06:55.779 --> 06:57.530
and until we do,
we need to get Patterson

06:57.555 --> 06:59.419
away from her and out of this building.

07:00.743 --> 07:01.876
What are you doing?

07:01.901 --> 07:03.284
I'm using your log-in
to create a virus,

07:03.309 --> 07:04.864
knocking out the building's
security cameras,

07:04.889 --> 07:07.143
erase the footage from today,
and give you room to maneuver.

07:07.168 --> 07:08.814
Hey, how do you know my log-in?

07:09.074 --> 07:10.074
Please.

07:12.332 --> 07:14.374
It's a wanted alert. They're coming.

07:14.419 --> 07:15.547
What do I do?

07:15.592 --> 07:16.865
What do I do? What do I do?

07:16.890 --> 07:18.010
Just find a way out of here.

07:18.035 --> 07:20.637
We'll stop her, I promise.

07:25.230 --> 07:30.230
synced & corrected by PopcornAWH
www.addic7ed.com

07:31.973 --> 07:34.406
Patterson just became a fugitive
in our own building.

07:34.453 --> 07:36.488
We have to do everything
that we can to help her escape

07:36.513 --> 07:38.132
before Hirst arrests her
on these false charges.

07:38.157 --> 07:40.156
The security virus is almost complete.

07:40.638 --> 07:42.704
What the hell are you doing?

07:42.938 --> 07:44.853
Patterson released a virus
that's messing

07:44.921 --> 07:46.565
with the security feeds.
I'm trying to shut it down.

07:46.589 --> 07:47.923
Why the hell would she do that?

07:47.951 --> 07:49.307
And why is her face all over my phone?

07:49.332 --> 07:51.159
We just uncovered intel that proves

07:51.184 --> 07:53.195
that she is responsible
for Stuart's murder

07:53.220 --> 07:54.759
as well as another individual

07:54.784 --> 07:56.151
at a US Marshall safe house.

07:56.272 --> 07:58.043
Well, it's a setup. It's got to be.

07:58.068 --> 07:59.702
We know Patterson. She would never...

07:59.727 --> 08:01.161
Nobody knows anyone.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.408
You, of all people, should know that.

08:03.486 --> 08:05.654
Let Cybersecurity deal with the virus.

08:05.716 --> 08:07.717
Track her phone, now!

08:07.777 --> 08:09.006
Right. Yes.

08:09.031 --> 08:11.363
No reason why I shouldn't
be able to do that, right?

08:11.410 --> 08:13.396
That's right in my wheelhouse.

08:13.510 --> 08:14.962
Easy peasy.

08:15.051 --> 08:17.039
And there she is.

08:17.120 --> 08:19.227
She's in the locker-room. Let's go.

08:19.289 --> 08:21.523
Hang on. We don't know
that she's guilty yet.

08:21.548 --> 08:22.926
Well, then, let's just
give her a chance

08:22.951 --> 08:25.552
to explain herself. Shall we?

08:37.373 --> 08:38.740
She ditched it.

08:38.899 --> 08:41.458
I want this building
turned upside-down.

08:41.530 --> 08:42.999
This woman killed one of our own.

08:43.025 --> 08:44.639
We do not stop until we find her.

08:44.674 --> 08:46.198
We need to lock down
the entire building...

08:46.223 --> 08:48.095
- Blast doors, everything.
- No, no.

08:48.318 --> 08:50.519
A lockdown hurts us and helps her.

08:50.587 --> 08:53.270
She knows every emergency
protocol and its workaround.

08:53.456 --> 08:56.089
I want agents at every exit.
She's a trapped rat.

08:56.149 --> 08:58.127
It's a matter of time.
'Till we root her out.

08:58.194 --> 09:00.438
Whatever Patterson has or hasn't done,

09:00.463 --> 09:01.997
there is nothing in her history

09:02.029 --> 09:03.390
to suggest that she's dangerous.

09:03.415 --> 09:05.034
Other than the people she's murdered.

09:05.101 --> 09:06.802
- Allegedly.
- She's unarmed.

09:06.827 --> 09:08.060
We can take her alive.

09:08.085 --> 09:09.852
Patterson has killed one agent already.

09:09.877 --> 09:11.480
I won't see her kill any others.

09:11.541 --> 09:14.827
My priority is our safety, not hers.

09:14.852 --> 09:16.021
Now let's move!

09:18.806 --> 09:20.073
What the hell's going on?

09:20.098 --> 09:22.332
You tell me. Patterson
just sent me a message

09:22.357 --> 09:24.614
through her Wizardville app,
saying that she's hiding

09:24.639 --> 09:26.740
in the Faraday cage room
and needs help to escape.

09:26.808 --> 09:28.833
Yeah, that's because Hirst
just framed her for murder.

09:28.858 --> 09:30.183
- What?
- <i>This does not feel</i>

09:30.208 --> 09:31.483
like a very safe work environment.

09:31.508 --> 09:33.075
- You have to get her out.
- <i>I'm on it.</i>

09:33.167 --> 09:35.135
Finally, something fun around here.

09:37.464 --> 09:38.798
Marco.

09:40.355 --> 09:41.788
Marco.

09:43.371 --> 09:44.382
Marco.

09:44.407 --> 09:46.757
I am not saying "Polo."
What took you so long?

09:46.888 --> 09:48.164
You need to help me get out of here.

09:48.189 --> 09:49.669
Why does everybody assume that I know

09:49.694 --> 09:51.459
how to escape from this building?

09:51.719 --> 09:53.199
All right, fine. I may have some plans

09:53.224 --> 09:54.383
laying in wait in case you guys

09:54.408 --> 09:55.663
decide to throw me
back in the big house.

09:55.688 --> 09:57.065
Now, what day is it?

09:57.631 --> 09:59.832
Paper shredding day.

09:59.920 --> 10:01.123
We gotta use the vents.

10:01.148 --> 10:03.650
Here. All right.

10:03.824 --> 10:05.525
I want you to remember
these directions.

10:05.780 --> 10:08.582
Up, up, down, down, left, right...

10:08.649 --> 10:10.217
No, wait, that's Contra. Where are we?

10:10.738 --> 10:14.421
All right, go left, right,
right, skip two rights,

10:14.489 --> 10:17.023
right, and then left. Is that right?

10:18.739 --> 10:20.222
I'll meet you down there.

10:20.247 --> 10:22.682
- Wait, you're not coming with me?
- What are you, nuts?

10:22.707 --> 10:24.310
This shirt is vintage
and these vents are gross.

10:24.335 --> 10:25.862
I'm gonna use the hallways
like a regular person.

10:25.887 --> 10:27.617
Besides, I've got to get you
something very important

10:27.642 --> 10:29.424
from my office, but you've got
to promise to give it back.

10:29.449 --> 10:30.459
- Okay.
- Here we go.

10:30.484 --> 10:32.118
- Hup! Ho! Hup!
- I got it.

10:32.143 --> 10:33.210
Hup! Okay.

10:34.841 --> 10:36.407
What? What just happened?

10:36.486 --> 10:37.926
I just asked for a chicken sandwich.

10:37.951 --> 10:39.418
No, that is not what you asked for.

10:39.443 --> 10:41.972
It's <i>"pollo,"</i> with an "o."

10:41.997 --> 10:44.232
You have to...
You have to watch the vowels.

10:44.326 --> 10:46.361
- Right. What did I say?
- Uh...

10:51.166 --> 10:52.966
You know that guy?

10:53.028 --> 10:54.487
Yeah, unfortunately.

10:54.512 --> 10:56.113
Ever since our mugging incident,

10:56.138 --> 10:57.538
my father has put a bodyguard on me

10:57.633 --> 10:58.717
24 hours a day.

10:58.982 --> 11:02.655
Honestly, I just don't like
the feeling of being watched.

11:02.722 --> 11:04.190
So tell him you don't want it.

11:04.809 --> 11:07.277
My father is not a man you say no to.

11:13.552 --> 11:14.686
You want to ditch him?

11:14.754 --> 11:16.121
Yes, I do.

11:26.025 --> 11:28.051
Sir, I need you to open this bin.

11:28.266 --> 11:29.791
Wait! Oh, jeez!

11:29.931 --> 11:31.374
I'm so glad I caught you.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.092
I have some paper shreds
that need to go out today

11:33.117 --> 11:34.835
or I'm gonna be in very serious, uh...

11:34.902 --> 11:36.342
Can we just roll it back real quick?

11:36.370 --> 11:37.976
- It'll just take five minutes.
- Open the bin, sir.

11:38.001 --> 11:39.082
Are you sure you want to do that?

11:39.107 --> 11:40.677
I mean, it says "do
not open" right here.

11:40.702 --> 11:41.835
So, I don't know if you've ever dealt

11:41.860 --> 11:43.371
with the customer service
department at Paper Vortex,

11:43.396 --> 11:44.688
but they are not, uh...

11:44.778 --> 11:47.722
That's, um... Okay. Yeah.

11:51.591 --> 11:53.325
All right, go ahead.

11:54.334 --> 11:56.035
Um, have you seen this woman?

11:57.585 --> 11:59.984
No, not since... not since
she murdered those people.

12:00.009 --> 12:02.262
That's, uh... that's rough.
Is that your case?

12:02.290 --> 12:04.861
It's really gonna change the vibe
around the office, you know.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.528
I can't believe that worked.

12:20.715 --> 12:22.549
I can't believe I wore this thing.

12:22.617 --> 12:24.084
What does Rich do with that?

12:24.151 --> 12:25.657
He said he keeps it on hand

12:25.682 --> 12:27.597
for quick escapes,
but I think he uses it

12:27.622 --> 12:28.942
for more than that. You know what?

12:28.966 --> 12:31.568
I don't even want to
think about it. Just drive.

12:34.462 --> 12:35.629
Whatcha got?

12:35.696 --> 12:36.954
Missing screw. Two sets of prints.

12:36.979 --> 12:38.019
She's in the vents.

12:38.044 --> 12:40.345
Find her, now!

12:41.610 --> 12:43.177
How long for the lab work on those?

12:43.205 --> 12:44.883
It's already expedited.
If they're in the system,

12:44.908 --> 12:46.294
shouldn't be more that a few minutes.

12:46.319 --> 12:47.904
Good. Someone's helping her.

12:47.929 --> 12:49.630
I want to know who.

12:51.694 --> 12:52.994
What are you doing?

12:53.145 --> 12:54.851
Uh, just checking for updates.

12:54.903 --> 12:57.138
Nothing yet. Let's keep looking.

12:57.163 --> 12:58.715
All right, now
that Patterson's escaped,

12:58.740 --> 13:00.260
we can focus on proving she's innocent

13:00.302 --> 13:01.469
and Hirst is the guilty one.

13:01.494 --> 13:03.165
Great. How do we do that?

13:03.206 --> 13:05.511
Reade said Hirst had
a second phone in her office.

13:05.708 --> 13:07.442
Lots of agents have two phones...

13:07.566 --> 13:08.899
One business, one personal.

13:08.924 --> 13:10.922
She ordered the hit
on Van Gogh yesterday.

13:10.947 --> 13:12.910
There's no way she's
working alone in this.

13:12.935 --> 13:14.936
She needs to be in contact with people

13:14.961 --> 13:16.921
and she'd be crazy to use a Bureau cell

13:16.946 --> 13:18.474
or a landline for anything illicit.

13:18.499 --> 13:20.059
Ah! That's what
the second phone is for.

13:20.092 --> 13:21.643
Anything shady. It's a shade phone.

13:21.668 --> 13:23.269
Yeah. So how do we get it?

13:23.532 --> 13:25.834
We don't. I access it remotely.

13:26.161 --> 13:27.295
I've got to use your log-in.

13:27.320 --> 13:28.473
You know, they're tracing mine.

13:28.498 --> 13:30.032
Why do you know all of our log-ins?

13:30.106 --> 13:31.535
What is this, "Blue's Clues"?

13:31.560 --> 13:33.770
Just be grateful I'm here or you
Muggles would be up a creek.

13:33.795 --> 13:35.762
Okay, less talking, more typing.

13:36.585 --> 13:38.186
Step away from the computer.

13:38.554 --> 13:40.618
I asked him if he could
locate Patterson.

13:40.643 --> 13:41.923
He just helped Patterson escape.

13:41.983 --> 13:43.551
Your fingerprints were on the vent.

13:43.579 --> 13:45.723
Since when is it illegal
to touch a vent?

13:45.748 --> 13:47.330
Rich.com, you're under arrest

13:47.355 --> 13:49.176
for aiding and abetting a fugitive.

13:49.552 --> 13:52.721
Oh, yeah, that... That sounds illegal.

13:55.947 --> 13:58.200
Okay, look, I don't know
what you think you know,

13:58.225 --> 14:00.259
But just know that I would
never knowingly...

14:00.284 --> 14:02.087
Tie up a deliveryman
and use his uniform

14:02.112 --> 14:03.463
to smuggle out a fugitive?

14:03.488 --> 14:05.522
Leave your prints on the vent
she escaped through?

14:05.590 --> 14:06.990
We know you helped Patterson.

14:07.058 --> 14:08.292
Just tell us what you know,

14:08.359 --> 14:09.517
or you're on the next transfer van

14:09.542 --> 14:12.443
back to prison.

14:13.064 --> 14:15.199
She basically held me hostage.

14:15.366 --> 14:16.567
She put a gun to my head.

14:16.634 --> 14:18.273
She said, "Either you help me escape"

14:18.298 --> 14:19.938
"from this building,
or I help your brains

14:19.963 --> 14:22.168
escape from their skull."

14:22.466 --> 14:23.766
Oh, man!

14:23.934 --> 14:26.102
It feels good to get that off my chest.

14:28.652 --> 14:30.798
Okay, you guys want the truth?

14:30.842 --> 14:32.118
Patterson's in love with me.

14:32.143 --> 14:34.463
We've been sleeping together
in the vents for months, okay?

14:34.648 --> 14:35.906
She's a claustrophile.

14:36.001 --> 14:37.312
It's a real thing.
You should look it up.

14:37.375 --> 14:38.815
How are we supposed to get her phone

14:38.840 --> 14:40.708
when we don't have Rich to hack it?

14:40.733 --> 14:42.100
We do it the hard way...

14:42.294 --> 14:43.834
Break in her office and steal it.

14:43.895 --> 14:46.230
We can't just walk up to
the door and pick the lock.

14:46.297 --> 14:48.082
I mean, even with Rich's security virus

14:48.107 --> 14:49.975
keeping electronic eyes off of us,

14:50.000 --> 14:51.840
how are we supposed to
avoid all the human eyes

14:51.865 --> 14:52.969
in this place?

14:53.271 --> 14:55.454
I think I might have an idea.

14:56.321 --> 14:59.156
My office, your office,
uh, the conference room.

14:59.181 --> 15:00.541
You know those revolving platforms

15:00.566 --> 15:02.058
where we scan Jane's tattoos?

15:02.113 --> 15:03.614
We had sex in there, too.

15:03.681 --> 15:05.932
I find that the lasers
are surprisingly conducive

15:05.957 --> 15:07.303
- to a very satisfying...
- All right.

15:08.392 --> 15:10.029
Much as I enjoy listening to you

15:10.054 --> 15:12.143
burn the clock with
your little romance novel,

15:12.168 --> 15:13.890
your partner in crime
is still out there,

15:13.958 --> 15:16.293
so why don't we just try
a different approach?

15:16.361 --> 15:18.695
You give up Patterson
and I'll release you,

15:18.763 --> 15:22.065
free and clear,
with time served, today.

15:22.133 --> 15:24.991
I'm sorry, "free and clear"?

15:25.310 --> 15:27.678
You mean, like, <i>free</i>
<i>and clear</i> free and clear?

15:27.779 --> 15:29.646
Will you stay loyal to a murderer

15:29.687 --> 15:33.223
or help us bring her in
and buy your life back?

15:34.646 --> 15:36.347
What's it gonna be, Rich?

15:37.595 --> 15:39.896
Can't say that I ever thought
that I'd be doing this.

15:39.930 --> 15:41.230
Hold that.

15:42.663 --> 15:44.729
First Patterson, now Rich.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.913
She'll be coming for us next.

15:48.158 --> 15:50.326
I don't want to lose you.

15:50.614 --> 15:52.581
And I don't want to lose you.

15:54.198 --> 15:55.532
So what else did Roman say

15:55.600 --> 15:56.867
this morning on the phone?

15:56.934 --> 15:58.568
I know you're not
telling me everything.

15:58.780 --> 16:00.704
He said that I have to kill Hirst.

16:00.772 --> 16:02.005
Or what?

16:02.073 --> 16:03.273
He'd make sure

16:03.301 --> 16:04.839
that we never see each other again.

16:04.919 --> 16:07.544
Well, what is that? A death threat?

16:07.612 --> 16:09.218
Well, what else did he tell you, Kurt?

16:09.251 --> 16:10.771
We don't have time for this right now.

16:10.796 --> 16:11.991
We have to get that phone.

16:12.016 --> 16:13.456
And you're sure this is a good idea?

16:13.518 --> 16:16.019
No, but it's all we got.

16:16.398 --> 16:17.842
Gonna call Patterson.

16:17.867 --> 16:19.268
This is your idea?

16:19.416 --> 16:21.985
This morning, I was
falsely accused of a felony

16:22.025 --> 16:23.960
and now we're committing a real one?

16:24.935 --> 16:26.136
All right.

16:27.879 --> 16:29.046
What does he want you to do?

16:29.442 --> 16:32.562
Hi, this is Special Agent Patterson.

16:33.116 --> 16:35.651
I'd like to call in a bomb threat.

16:36.294 --> 16:38.729
There, as promised.

16:38.876 --> 16:40.478
You give us Patterson

16:40.503 --> 16:42.221
and you're just a John Hancock away

16:42.246 --> 16:43.773
from walking out that door.

16:50.785 --> 16:52.856
All right, I'll sweeten the deal.

16:53.140 --> 16:56.193
I know you've been looking
for your ex-boyfriend Boston.

16:56.503 --> 16:57.670
We know where he is.

16:57.695 --> 17:00.931
You give up Patterson, we'll tell you.

17:18.048 --> 17:19.415
I don't have a lot of friends.

17:19.483 --> 17:21.184
I'm not gonna risk
losing the ones I have

17:21.252 --> 17:22.586
over something as superficial

17:22.653 --> 17:24.654
and fleeting as complete
and total freedom.

17:24.722 --> 17:28.184
Transfer this convict
to Rikers, gen pop.

17:28.451 --> 17:30.026
I hear they're real big fans

17:30.054 --> 17:31.334
of people who work with the FBI.

17:31.358 --> 17:32.989
Are you serious?

17:33.056 --> 17:34.264
All right, I authorize it.

17:34.332 --> 17:35.732
Authorize what?

17:35.757 --> 17:37.214
<i>This is a code purple.</i>

17:37.239 --> 17:39.052
<i>Please evacuate
the building immediately.</i>

17:39.077 --> 17:40.358
Patterson called in a bomb threat.

17:40.383 --> 17:41.531
We have to evacuate the building.

17:41.556 --> 17:44.090
It's a bluff.
She's trying to distract us.

17:44.115 --> 17:45.348
I'm gonna wait in my office.

17:45.373 --> 17:46.684
You said it yourself.
She's killed two agents.

17:46.709 --> 17:48.277
We've already lost one FBI director

17:48.302 --> 17:49.311
in this building already.

17:49.380 --> 17:51.159
I refuse to let that happen again.

17:51.193 --> 17:52.649
We gotta follow the evacuation protocol

17:52.717 --> 17:54.132
and let the bomb squad do their thing.

17:54.157 --> 17:55.561
<i>This is a code purple.</i>

17:55.586 --> 17:56.953
<i>Please evacuate the building.</i>

17:57.054 --> 17:58.955
Excuse me. Coming through.

18:03.872 --> 18:05.381
All right. We got an IED.

18:06.183 --> 18:08.656
Looks chemical. Disarming now.

18:10.001 --> 18:11.368
All right, I'm in.

18:13.722 --> 18:14.847
What was that?

18:14.872 --> 18:16.306
We don't have time to find out.

18:21.282 --> 18:22.282
Bingo.

18:22.319 --> 18:24.253
Hey, my phone's erased.

18:24.415 --> 18:25.849
It's completely bricked.

18:25.917 --> 18:27.284
Mine, too.

18:27.351 --> 18:29.319
That door must be magnetic.

18:29.387 --> 18:30.287
She booby-trapped this office,

18:30.621 --> 18:31.988
so if we walk out with this,

18:32.056 --> 18:33.356
it'll erase all the evidence.

18:33.424 --> 18:35.158
If she's careful enough to set this up,

18:35.226 --> 18:37.294
then she probably also...

18:37.361 --> 18:39.329
<i>This is a code purple.
Please evacuate...</i>

18:39.725 --> 18:41.531
Someone just broke into my office.

18:42.171 --> 18:43.767
The bomb's still active. We can't stay.

18:43.835 --> 18:45.202
Read me the handbook

18:45.269 --> 18:47.637
when we arrest who's in there.

18:47.705 --> 18:48.839
Last wire.

18:51.388 --> 18:52.722
Get out, now!

18:55.165 --> 18:56.299
It's a fake!

18:58.290 --> 19:00.290
What are you doing?
She's gonna be here any second.

19:00.315 --> 19:01.674
I'm gonna throw this phone
down the vent, all right?

19:01.699 --> 19:03.059
So, do you want to
go around and grab it?

19:03.084 --> 19:05.220
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me, all right?

19:05.259 --> 19:06.656
Just get the phone to Patterson

19:06.681 --> 19:08.179
and get out of here before Hirst

19:08.204 --> 19:09.747
grabs you, too, all right?

19:09.954 --> 19:11.560
I'll try to buy you
as much time as I can.

19:11.585 --> 19:13.185
I won't let her win, I promise.

19:14.462 --> 19:15.762
Hey, stop!

19:15.787 --> 19:16.961
- Whoa, whoa!
- Agent Weller,

19:16.986 --> 19:18.520
move out of the way, sir.

19:19.800 --> 19:21.160
Agent Weller, you're under arrest.

19:21.185 --> 19:22.209
Fine.

19:22.269 --> 19:24.337
I'm gonna put my weapon down, okay?

19:26.174 --> 19:27.341
There you go.

19:27.366 --> 19:28.766
- Please.
- I can't let you do that.

19:28.791 --> 19:30.025
Move out of the way, sir.

19:32.961 --> 19:34.395
Step out of the way, sir!

19:34.420 --> 19:35.840
Take him down, now!

19:39.981 --> 19:41.215
Agent Weller, please move!

19:41.240 --> 19:42.358
I'm not doing that.

19:42.383 --> 19:43.546
Take him down!

19:49.562 --> 19:51.430
Time's almost up.

19:52.240 --> 19:53.874
What's it gonna be, Kurt?

19:53.895 --> 19:57.062
Kill Hirst or... lose Jane?

19:57.210 --> 19:59.345
I can't move.

19:59.768 --> 20:00.868
Why can't I move?

20:00.935 --> 20:03.904
Frankly, I...
I don't see the issue, heh.

20:03.972 --> 20:06.974
Murder a bad person,
or lose the love of your life.

20:07.041 --> 20:08.509
It seems like a no-brainer to me.

20:08.576 --> 20:09.943
I am not a murderer.

20:10.011 --> 20:11.678
Well, one way or another,

20:11.746 --> 20:13.847
something's gotta die today.

20:13.915 --> 20:15.840
Tick-tock.

20:15.941 --> 20:18.910
Kurt, what did you do?

20:18.978 --> 20:21.045
I can't...

20:22.848 --> 20:24.722
You'll never forgive me.

20:24.837 --> 20:26.671
You're not a killer.

20:26.939 --> 20:29.140
I know you.

20:29.208 --> 20:31.442
You don't.

20:31.503 --> 20:32.745
I'm so sorry.

20:32.817 --> 20:35.552
You can make all this go away

20:35.928 --> 20:37.962
just with a squeeze of the trigger.

20:38.147 --> 20:39.629
I'd do it to you.

20:39.654 --> 20:41.354
Hell, maybe I still will.

20:41.667 --> 20:43.377
I am not you.

20:43.428 --> 20:45.563
You sure about that?

20:50.975 --> 20:52.142
Do it.

20:55.024 --> 20:56.024
Do it!

20:56.048 --> 20:57.222
Kurt, no!

21:01.120 --> 21:02.458
This is not how I pictured you

21:02.483 --> 21:03.750
waking up next to me.

21:03.869 --> 21:05.870
We know you and Jane
broke into my office

21:05.938 --> 21:08.706
and stole my personal phone.
Where is she now?

21:08.780 --> 21:11.320
Interrogating two accomplices
at the same time.

21:11.737 --> 21:13.204
It's a great strategy.

21:13.229 --> 21:14.529
I'm not letting either of you

21:14.554 --> 21:15.704
out of my sight.

21:15.729 --> 21:17.563
There is not one person
in this building

21:17.588 --> 21:19.226
that I can trust right now,

21:19.251 --> 21:20.885
except Assistant Director Reade.

21:20.973 --> 21:22.407
Wake up, Reade.

21:22.474 --> 21:24.319
This woman isn't who you think she is.

21:24.362 --> 21:26.196
My eyes are wide open, Kurt,

21:26.412 --> 21:27.947
and I don't like what I see.

21:27.972 --> 21:29.973
- I trusted you.
- You still can.

21:30.328 --> 21:31.883
She's pitting us against each other.

21:31.908 --> 21:33.700
Stop! Enough lies.

21:33.725 --> 21:36.436
Assistant Director, you know
the suspect better than I do.

21:36.597 --> 21:39.266
Why don't you run point on this one?

22:00.379 --> 22:02.090
It's from one of your lab techs.

22:02.220 --> 22:04.755
She just texted, "Your turf, her tech."

22:04.780 --> 22:06.904
- What the hell does that mean?
- My turf?

22:07.098 --> 22:09.166
Does she mean my lab?

22:09.355 --> 22:11.436
Wait, you still have access
to FBI computers?

22:11.461 --> 22:12.759
Hirst didn't lock you out?

22:12.784 --> 22:14.235
Oh, immediately, which is why

22:14.260 --> 22:16.160
you always hide a spare key.

22:16.228 --> 22:18.830
Unknown device, heavily encrypted.

22:18.897 --> 22:21.165
This is a phone.

22:22.368 --> 22:24.035
Holy hell.

22:24.103 --> 22:25.837
I think this is Hirst's phone.

22:25.904 --> 22:27.981
That's no lab tech. That's one of us.

22:28.054 --> 22:29.614
Now we just have to
upload it, crack it,

22:29.639 --> 22:31.199
and see if there's
something we can use.

22:31.224 --> 22:32.832
That's it? Yeah. Total breeze.

22:35.179 --> 22:37.614
I can't believe you lost my bodyguard.

22:37.750 --> 22:39.684
Oh, my God.

22:39.752 --> 22:41.646
That was amazing!

22:42.388 --> 22:44.022
You're amazing.

22:44.089 --> 22:45.490
You say that like this is goodbye,

22:45.557 --> 22:48.259
but, uh, I've kind of
been staying here, remember?

22:48.327 --> 22:51.296
Right. Well, then, I guess it makes it

22:51.363 --> 22:54.332
easier to ask you to come upstairs.

22:57.002 --> 22:58.389
You really want to
check that, don't you?

22:58.414 --> 23:00.682
Yes. I'm so sorry.

23:04.043 --> 23:05.243
What's wrong?

23:05.311 --> 23:07.178
My father wants to have dinner with me.

23:07.325 --> 23:09.266
What? Right now? Say no.

23:09.353 --> 23:10.468
- No, my father is...
- Is not...

23:10.492 --> 23:12.850
Not someone you say no to, right.

23:12.918 --> 23:16.888
Well, I guess I have
a date with a cold shower.

23:18.123 --> 23:19.924
Would you like to have dinner with us?

23:21.286 --> 23:23.728
With you and your dad?

23:23.796 --> 23:25.496
Right. No, I don't mean, like,

23:25.564 --> 23:26.898
I don't... I don't mean, like,

23:26.965 --> 23:28.266
"Do you want to meet my dad?"

23:28.334 --> 23:30.902
I'm just saying, like,

23:30.969 --> 23:32.170
do you want to eat with us?

23:32.237 --> 23:35.340
I mean, everyone has to eat, right?

23:36.622 --> 23:38.856
Sure, I'd love to.

23:41.485 --> 23:44.615
Come on, you stupid
progress bar, progress.

23:44.683 --> 23:45.983
Do you think Reade's okay?

23:46.051 --> 23:47.929
I mean, he has to literally
stand next to the devil

23:47.953 --> 23:49.153
and pretend to be on her side.

23:49.188 --> 23:50.855
You know we're all in trouble, right?

23:50.923 --> 23:52.957
I know, I'm worried about all of us.

23:53.025 --> 23:54.826
Then why are you just
asking about Rea...

23:54.972 --> 23:56.440
Oh, my God.

23:56.902 --> 23:59.230
You like him. You like Reade.

23:59.298 --> 24:00.772
Like, <i>like</i> like him.

24:00.797 --> 24:03.835
Tasha, he has a girlfriend,
and it's Reade.

24:05.204 --> 24:06.637
The upload's finished.

24:07.979 --> 24:10.180
Okay. To be continued.

24:12.389 --> 24:14.312
Look, I... I get it.

24:14.380 --> 24:16.447
They're your friends.
They were my friends, too.

24:16.515 --> 24:17.659
Jane's your wife.

24:17.745 --> 24:18.950
But it's over... You're caught.

24:19.017 --> 24:20.685
Why don't you just
save us all the trouble

24:20.753 --> 24:21.986
and tell us where they are

24:22.014 --> 24:23.534
and admit that you've been undermining

24:23.558 --> 24:25.705
these Jane Doe cases
from the very beginning.

24:25.751 --> 24:27.328
Why don't you offer him
some of that complete

24:27.353 --> 24:28.730
and total freedom you were giving out?

24:28.755 --> 24:29.955
Shut up, Rich!

24:31.677 --> 24:33.443
Director Hirst's personal phone

24:33.536 --> 24:35.104
is missing from the desk in her office.

24:35.129 --> 24:36.664
Why did you and Jane steal it?

24:36.964 --> 24:39.313
I'm guessing to plant
false information on,

24:39.338 --> 24:41.973
cover up their crimes by framing me.

24:42.040 --> 24:43.541
Not a bad plan,

24:43.609 --> 24:45.610
except you got your hand
caught in the cookie jar.

24:45.677 --> 24:47.745
Anything untoward found on there now,

24:47.813 --> 24:49.304
we'll know exactly

24:49.329 --> 24:51.057
who put it there, won't we?

24:51.237 --> 24:54.152
You got it all figured out, don't you?

24:54.219 --> 24:57.155
Look, you and I both know
you were compromised

24:57.222 --> 24:59.066
the minute Jane Doe
walked into our lives.

24:59.091 --> 25:01.702
Whatever incorruptible
super-agent you once were,

25:01.727 --> 25:03.804
I've watched that integrity erode,

25:04.069 --> 25:05.897
watched you care more about Jane

25:05.964 --> 25:08.025
and less about the badge
every single day.

25:08.050 --> 25:09.884
- Tell me I'm wrong.
- You're wrong!

25:10.367 --> 25:13.971
I've never disgraced
the badge that I wear... ever.

25:14.472 --> 25:16.427
As for my feelings about Jane,

25:16.595 --> 25:17.995
that is my business.

25:18.700 --> 25:20.680
This isn't gonna work.

25:21.533 --> 25:23.093
You need to give me something concrete,

25:23.118 --> 25:26.578
something I can act on, or it's over.

25:26.939 --> 25:29.574
Do you understand me?

25:34.940 --> 25:36.641
You search my desk.

25:36.968 --> 25:37.968
Search my locker.

25:37.993 --> 25:39.394
Turn this place upside-down.

25:39.591 --> 25:40.897
You're not gonna find anything,

25:40.922 --> 25:42.256
'cause there's nothing to find.

25:45.337 --> 25:46.548
What about your place?

25:46.573 --> 25:48.555
What are we gonna find
if we were to raid

25:48.580 --> 25:50.915
the Weller-Doe residence right now?

25:53.218 --> 25:54.898
Do you really think
that I'd be dumb enough

25:54.923 --> 25:56.955
to have anything incriminating
in my own home?

25:57.062 --> 25:59.496
Yeah, I do.

26:00.832 --> 26:02.723
How is it searching so fast?

26:02.814 --> 26:03.804
Decryption software

26:03.829 --> 26:05.012
I've been developing with Rich.

26:05.037 --> 26:06.357
I will never say this to his face,

26:06.382 --> 26:08.006
but he's annoyingly good
at what he does.

26:08.120 --> 26:10.600
Who's playing Wizardville right now?

26:12.103 --> 26:13.937
"Serpent attack. Retreat."

26:14.508 --> 26:15.758
It's from Reade.

26:15.783 --> 26:16.889
He's warning us they're coming.

26:16.914 --> 26:18.181
We have to go, now.

26:18.206 --> 26:19.840
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. Look at this.

26:19.911 --> 26:21.555
It's a hidden contact list.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.676
Whoa. Kinga.

26:23.701 --> 26:24.635
The company that made

26:24.660 --> 26:26.294
Stuart's home voice-controlled system.

26:26.357 --> 26:27.657
This could be the person

26:27.682 --> 26:29.242
that erased the recording
of his murder.

26:29.267 --> 26:30.766
- Does it say who it is?
- I don't know.

26:30.791 --> 26:32.525
I have to decrypt
the rest of the contact.

26:32.550 --> 26:33.841
We have to go now.

26:33.866 --> 26:36.022
We can't investigate this
from an FBI holding room.

26:36.047 --> 26:37.625
And we can't investigate it
if we don't know

26:37.650 --> 26:39.761
what it is, either... this isn't
something I can do on my phone.

26:39.817 --> 26:41.912
- Patterson.
- I will stay and get the rest,

26:41.937 --> 26:43.328
and I will try to send it to you.

26:43.353 --> 26:44.673
They're gonna be here any minute.

26:44.698 --> 26:46.448
Which is why you need
to get the hell out of here.

26:46.473 --> 26:48.507
Use the fire escape. Go.

26:52.457 --> 26:53.457
Come on.

26:55.908 --> 26:57.475
Yes! Got it.

27:03.605 --> 27:04.849
We know you're in there!

27:04.917 --> 27:06.544
Hands in the air! Get on the ground!

27:06.618 --> 27:07.651
FBI!

27:07.826 --> 27:09.360
You're under arrest!

27:11.210 --> 27:13.644
So, how does it feel,

27:14.330 --> 27:17.315
knowing you're finished?

27:18.200 --> 27:21.061
Apart from the myriad of laws
broken under this roof today,

27:21.086 --> 27:23.755
we now know that
Agent Patterson killed Stuart.

27:23.823 --> 27:25.456
That is a lie and you know it.

27:25.524 --> 27:28.096
And ordered the hit
on the man known as Van Gogh.

27:28.121 --> 27:30.738
Although I also find
Agent Weller's proximity

27:30.763 --> 27:32.508
to the shooting highly suspicious.

27:32.533 --> 27:34.634
This was you, all of it!

27:34.814 --> 27:37.416
The raid on your apartment
uncovered hardware

27:37.441 --> 27:39.914
that you've all been using
to obscure the truth

27:39.939 --> 27:42.674
about Jane's new tattoos,
that Roman designed them

27:42.741 --> 27:45.265
solely to expose corruption
within this team.

27:45.411 --> 27:47.111
Meaning, we catch Jane,

27:47.146 --> 27:49.013
we can put the Jane Doe files to rest.

27:49.081 --> 27:53.442
You know what?
You... you are... not nice.

27:53.532 --> 27:55.567
Where are Jane and Zapata now?

28:07.833 --> 28:10.153
We don't keep that kind of
data on our Kinga devices.

28:10.206 --> 28:11.646
I want the recordings by end of day.

28:15.608 --> 28:17.075
Recognize me?

28:29.421 --> 28:30.922
Sam, can you hear me?

28:35.694 --> 28:37.982
Wherever you are, yes, I can help you,

28:38.007 --> 28:39.307
but I need your help, too.

28:39.332 --> 28:41.335
Whatever it is these
people are looking for,

28:41.376 --> 28:43.735
it obviously matters
to the woman they work for.

28:43.802 --> 28:46.580
If you still have it,
we need it, please,

28:46.666 --> 28:48.800
before she hurts you or anyone else.

28:51.590 --> 28:52.957
"Bleach bottle."

28:58.177 --> 28:59.911
Thanks, Sam.

29:04.056 --> 29:05.456
Hey!

29:08.861 --> 29:10.595
Stop!

29:13.779 --> 29:15.146
Hey, stop!

29:15.221 --> 29:16.439
Hands!

29:18.741 --> 29:20.505
- Hello?
<i>- Briana, it's Tasha.</i>

29:20.530 --> 29:22.556
<i>I need you to do something.</i> We're
a little busy right now, Zapata.

29:22.581 --> 29:23.587
I'm gonna have to call you back.

29:23.612 --> 29:25.633
Briana, just... listen to me.

29:25.658 --> 29:27.092
<i>I need you to stay on the line</i>

29:27.117 --> 29:28.376
<i>and access the intercom.</i>

29:28.401 --> 29:30.502
<i>Briana, just do it.</i>

29:30.623 --> 29:32.324
This woman's extremely dangerous.

29:32.511 --> 29:35.547
If you feel threatened,
do not hesitate to shoot.

29:35.641 --> 29:37.944
Jane Doe, you are under arrest.

29:38.994 --> 29:40.953
- <i>Director Hirst.</i>
<i>- Hi, Stuart.</i>

29:41.178 --> 29:42.211
What is that?

29:42.246 --> 29:43.546
<i>May I come in?</i>

29:43.987 --> 29:45.120
<i>Of course.</i>

29:45.188 --> 29:46.336
Who's do... Who's doing that?

29:46.389 --> 29:47.814
<i>I was just having dinner...</i>

29:47.877 --> 29:49.010
Turn it off!

29:49.346 --> 29:50.995
<i>And... I got your text.</i>

29:51.020 --> 29:52.741
<i>It sounded pretty important,
so I thought I'd just...</i>

29:52.766 --> 29:53.794
Turn it off.

29:53.819 --> 29:54.876
<i>Whoa.</i>

29:54.901 --> 29:57.055
- Cuff her!
- No, let it play.

29:57.080 --> 29:58.356
<i>This tattoo decoded
to a list of names...</i>

29:58.381 --> 30:00.779
<i>Every person that's ever
owned this one painting.</i>

30:00.804 --> 30:02.472
<i>Van Gogh's self-portrait.</i>

30:02.497 --> 30:03.637
<i>Yeah, and I remembered</i>

30:03.662 --> 30:05.062
<i>when I ran into you on 14th Street,</i>

30:05.087 --> 30:06.204
<i>you were with a friend.</i>

30:06.229 --> 30:07.669
<i>He said everyone called him Van Gogh</i>

30:07.694 --> 30:09.078
<i>because he was missing an ear.</i>

30:09.103 --> 30:11.471
<i>I'm glad you came to me about this.</i>

30:18.936 --> 30:21.193
<i>Yeah. I need a clean-up crew...</i>

30:21.504 --> 30:24.173
<i>and no more meets on 14th Street.</i>

30:24.228 --> 30:26.796
Eleanor Hirst, you're
under arrest for conspiracy,

30:26.821 --> 30:28.714
falsifying and suppressing evidence,

30:28.753 --> 30:30.687
and for the murder of
a federal agent. Cuff her.

30:35.210 --> 30:36.549
You seem pretty chill for someone

30:36.574 --> 30:37.941
whose entire life just ended.

30:38.059 --> 30:39.826
I haven't lost yet.

30:39.945 --> 30:41.225
In fact, you're about to walk me

30:41.250 --> 30:42.392
right out of this building.

30:42.417 --> 30:43.532
Why the hell would I do that?

30:45.820 --> 30:47.454
You might want to check that.

30:55.136 --> 30:57.037
They're not gonna help you.

30:57.118 --> 30:59.153
They're with me.

30:59.405 --> 31:00.687
You'd better not hurt her.

31:00.712 --> 31:02.980
If I'm not where I need
to be in 30 minutes,

31:03.323 --> 31:05.825
Tasha's death is on you.

31:07.195 --> 31:08.796
Hey, what'd you think of the mask?

31:08.821 --> 31:10.956
Pretty lifelike, huh?

31:10.981 --> 31:13.101
Hey, thanks for the assist back there.

31:13.126 --> 31:15.165
Sure. Do you know where
Assistant Director Reade

31:15.190 --> 31:16.492
- is taking Hirst?
- What do you mean?

31:16.517 --> 31:17.651
I just saw him taking her up

31:17.676 --> 31:19.302
to the parking garage
with Berger and Kim

31:19.327 --> 31:20.260
a few minutes ago.

31:20.381 --> 31:22.015
Why the hell would he do that?

31:25.126 --> 31:27.194
Cuff him to the pipe.

31:31.486 --> 31:34.187
Don't worry, Zapata's already en route

31:34.669 --> 31:36.285
with my ticket out of here.

31:36.310 --> 31:37.577
Soon as I'm gone,

31:37.602 --> 31:39.500
she'll be released to your custody.

31:40.333 --> 31:42.266
Why not just kill me?
You got what you needed.

31:42.310 --> 31:45.779
Because I don't kill people
I don't have to.

31:45.999 --> 31:48.848
Besides... I like you, Edgar.

31:48.917 --> 31:50.017
Always have.

31:50.050 --> 31:52.185
Check the perimeter.

31:54.059 --> 31:55.426
You really think you can disappear

31:55.451 --> 31:57.126
with the entire FBI looking for us?

31:57.191 --> 31:58.892
I know a guy.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.685
I believe you're
familiar with his work.

32:00.710 --> 32:03.110
If you want to disappear
from the face of the Earth,

32:03.135 --> 32:04.340
apparently Rossi's your guy.

32:04.365 --> 32:05.732
Rossi.

32:05.907 --> 32:08.642
You killed Stuart, one of our own.

32:08.667 --> 32:09.868
You took an oath...

32:09.893 --> 32:11.374
Fidelity, bravery, integrity.

32:11.399 --> 32:13.259
Those words didn't
mean anything to you?

32:13.284 --> 32:14.764
I thought I taught you better.

32:14.789 --> 32:17.857
I'm playing a larger game, Edgar...

32:18.132 --> 32:20.975
and if you're smart, you'll play, too.

32:21.375 --> 32:22.789
Why would I ever do that?

32:22.814 --> 32:24.281
You're a realist.

32:24.659 --> 32:27.838
The man I work for...
Someone with real power...

32:28.342 --> 32:31.645
Could still use a realist
inside the FBI.

32:31.678 --> 32:34.344
Want to know why
I think I'm still alive?

32:34.848 --> 32:36.172
'Cause you're terrified.

32:36.197 --> 32:37.720
You messed up and just took yourself

32:37.745 --> 32:39.549
out of this larger game,
and if you don't

32:39.574 --> 32:41.208
find yourself a replacement,

32:41.233 --> 32:44.142
this man you work for
is gonna use all that power

32:44.167 --> 32:46.669
to wipe you right off
the face of the earth.

32:47.714 --> 32:49.348
Who the hell is this guy?

32:49.812 --> 32:52.338
Someone who doesn't like to lose.

32:52.547 --> 32:56.249
Dad, this is my friend Tom Jakeman.

32:56.317 --> 32:58.597
Tom, this is my father, Hank Crawford.

32:58.659 --> 33:00.227
So, this is the man who's captured

33:00.252 --> 33:01.953
my daughter's attention.

33:02.142 --> 33:03.649
It's a pleasure to meet you, son.

33:03.674 --> 33:05.948
Believe me, sir, the pleasure's mine.

33:07.503 --> 33:09.465
Right, we got a lead
on Reade and Hirst?

33:09.490 --> 33:11.148
No, and Zapata's still MIA,

33:11.173 --> 33:12.740
but we just got a 911 call

33:12.808 --> 33:14.874
from a driver reporting a Latina woman

33:14.899 --> 33:16.609
breaking out of a trunk at a stoplight

33:16.634 --> 33:17.795
and then getting shoved back in

33:17.820 --> 33:19.264
by a male driver who sped off.

33:19.289 --> 33:21.066
Description matches
what she was wearing today.

33:21.493 --> 33:23.333
That guy better hope
Zapata dies in that trunk,

33:23.358 --> 33:25.747
'cause it is not gonna be fun for
him when she gets out again.

33:25.772 --> 33:27.093
I'm not saying I want her to die,

33:27.118 --> 33:28.259
of course... please don't
tell her I said that.

33:28.284 --> 33:30.925
Driver also got plates.
We're tracking the vehicle now.

33:30.950 --> 33:32.051
We should find it soon.

33:32.076 --> 33:33.218
All right, Jane and
I will start heading

33:33.243 --> 33:34.536
in the direction
that call was made from.

33:34.543 --> 33:35.983
Let us know when you've
got an exact location.

33:36.008 --> 33:38.334
But no backup... chances are,
Hirst is using Zapata

33:38.359 --> 33:40.529
as leverage on Reade,
which means an exchange.

33:40.554 --> 33:41.652
Let's move.

33:43.385 --> 33:45.053
Thank you.

33:45.120 --> 33:47.355
That's quite a story, Tom.

33:47.423 --> 33:48.623
Is it?

33:48.884 --> 33:51.259
Well, I think it's beautiful...

33:51.326 --> 33:53.287
a friendship forged in war,

33:53.361 --> 33:55.162
broken by death, and then discovering

33:55.230 --> 33:57.644
you're the sole heir
to his secret fortune.

33:57.712 --> 33:59.179
All this money, this gift,

33:59.501 --> 34:01.580
this weight, wanting to do right by it,

34:01.648 --> 34:05.117
this hidden part of him
that you never knew.

34:06.035 --> 34:07.302
I had a dog when I was a boy,

34:07.370 --> 34:09.571
a German Shepherd named Gus.

34:09.639 --> 34:10.906
Very loyal animals.

34:10.974 --> 34:12.040
He used to watch us

34:12.108 --> 34:13.864
when we'd swim at our cabin.

34:13.878 --> 34:15.318
If he thought we'd gone out too far,

34:15.342 --> 34:16.520
he'd swim out, get us,

34:16.588 --> 34:18.922
put his jaws right around our arm,

34:19.289 --> 34:21.025
pull us back in to shore,
gentle as could be.

34:21.487 --> 34:22.987
Wow, good dog.

34:23.056 --> 34:24.480
The best.

34:24.568 --> 34:26.702
And then, one day,

34:26.770 --> 34:28.370
I was wrestling with my brother,

34:28.438 --> 34:30.172
and Gus attacked me.

34:30.239 --> 34:31.873
Put his teeth right through my wrist...

34:31.942 --> 34:34.376
42 stitches.

34:34.543 --> 34:37.145
They had to beat him
off me with a shovel.

34:38.313 --> 34:41.049
No one knows anyone.

34:43.063 --> 34:45.132
Not really.

34:47.424 --> 34:48.791
I disagree.

34:49.978 --> 34:51.547
I think most people

34:52.007 --> 34:53.849
spend their entire lives
trying to be known.

34:53.897 --> 34:55.553
It's just that most of us

34:55.806 --> 34:57.866
never find anyone who's capable of it.

34:57.934 --> 35:00.169
But, if you're lucky,
you can find someone

35:00.236 --> 35:04.807
who... who sees you... really sees you.

35:06.710 --> 35:08.110
All right, here's what I know.

35:08.178 --> 35:10.846
Today, you put my only child in danger.

35:10.914 --> 35:12.757
You sped away from a security detail

35:12.915 --> 35:14.048
at 100 miles an hour,

35:14.073 --> 35:15.972
risking her life, to show off.

35:16.052 --> 35:20.089
Now, why should I believe
a thing that you say?

35:20.156 --> 35:22.124
I never asked you to.

35:22.192 --> 35:24.827
I'm here for Blake, not you,

35:24.894 --> 35:26.261
and I didn't put Blake's life

35:26.329 --> 35:27.696
at risk today.

35:27.764 --> 35:29.064
You did, when you hired

35:29.132 --> 35:30.772
the man standing behind me
to protect her.

35:31.060 --> 35:33.102
It took me, what? Three
seconds today to lose him?

35:33.169 --> 35:35.004
Just like it'd take me
three seconds right now

35:35.071 --> 35:36.405
to strip the Sig in his jacket

35:36.473 --> 35:38.407
and use the slide
to crush his windpipe.

35:38.475 --> 35:40.409
If you want Blake to feel safe,

35:40.477 --> 35:42.306
hire someone who
will keep her that way.

35:42.331 --> 35:43.631
Speeches are easy.

35:43.947 --> 35:46.025
Follow-through, it's the hard part.

35:46.371 --> 35:48.671
So give your man a nod.

35:49.352 --> 35:51.730
He'll do what he does,
and I'll do what I do.

35:51.955 --> 35:54.156
The thing is, I've already beaten him.

35:54.290 --> 35:56.558
He knows it, and I know it.

35:59.763 --> 36:01.130
You're fired.

36:05.502 --> 36:07.202
Come and work for me.

36:09.084 --> 36:11.252
Help keep my daughter safe.

36:12.601 --> 36:14.002
Just like that?

36:15.357 --> 36:18.447
I think that might be
a conflict of interest.

36:18.515 --> 36:19.948
I have feelings for Blake.

36:20.443 --> 36:23.752
Okay. So, if you
already care about her,

36:24.046 --> 36:25.754
why not get paid for it?

36:25.822 --> 36:26.889
If you don't know,

36:26.956 --> 36:28.824
I'm not sure I can explain it.

36:32.448 --> 36:35.483
Thanks for dinner. I'll see you later?

36:36.366 --> 36:39.835
People don't tend to say no to me, son.

36:40.342 --> 36:42.810
Well, this should be good practice.

36:47.550 --> 36:49.945
Looks like your "disappearer"
up and disappeared.

36:50.956 --> 36:52.281
Give up the guy you work for.

36:52.308 --> 36:53.748
We can protect you from retaliation.

36:53.772 --> 36:54.783
One realist to another,

36:54.851 --> 36:56.474
you know this is your best shot.

37:00.836 --> 37:04.960
Nice try, but my ride's here.

37:16.539 --> 37:18.113
No...

37:18.227 --> 37:19.927
No!

37:42.357 --> 37:45.159
Game over. You're out of moves.

38:02.451 --> 38:03.551
Now!

38:06.841 --> 38:07.908
Uhh!

38:11.083 --> 38:12.528
Thanks.

38:12.595 --> 38:14.129
You, too.

38:14.197 --> 38:16.298
Do it!

38:16.919 --> 38:18.600
It's better than what's coming for me.

38:18.852 --> 38:20.682
And what is that? Who do you work for?

38:20.707 --> 38:22.871
You don't want to know!
You can't beat him!

38:23.075 --> 38:25.407
He'll only bring pain
and suffering to all of you!

38:25.719 --> 38:27.539
All the more reason to take him down.

38:27.606 --> 38:31.371
I'm already dead.
Just... pull the trigger.

38:32.114 --> 38:34.554
The only way she goes down
now is with a bullet.

38:34.723 --> 38:37.592
Eleanor Hirst, you're under arrest.

38:39.022 --> 38:40.389
Yeah.

38:41.691 --> 38:43.759
No... no.

38:43.827 --> 38:45.894
- No!
- Come on.

38:47.209 --> 38:49.578
Can't believe you guys kept
this place a secret from me.

38:49.603 --> 38:51.744
Sorry, Rich. Now that
Hirst is out of play,

38:51.769 --> 38:53.355
we don't have to work
in secret anymore.

38:53.380 --> 38:56.282
Man! - I can't believe you
rejected Hirst's deal,

38:56.307 --> 38:58.208
the chance to find Boston.

38:58.276 --> 38:59.843
Eh, she was bluffing.

38:59.911 --> 39:01.644
Boston won't get found
until he wants to get found.

39:01.669 --> 39:03.489
Or maybe you care about this team

39:03.514 --> 39:04.610
more than you want to admit.

39:04.655 --> 39:06.728
Maybe. Besides, uh, selling you out

39:06.753 --> 39:08.887
destroys any chance of a six-way, so...

39:09.106 --> 39:11.588
See? That is why you don't
know about this place.

39:11.656 --> 39:13.290
We'll start. Everybody else...

39:13.358 --> 39:15.292
Shut up and start helping us pack.

39:15.525 --> 39:17.324
Hey, Kurt, I want to apologize

39:17.349 --> 39:19.216
about what I said back
in the interrogation.

39:19.241 --> 39:21.242
You did what you had to do
to protect your cover.

39:21.286 --> 39:24.254
Besides, it must have
felt kind of good, huh?

39:24.502 --> 39:26.837
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

39:31.943 --> 39:33.250
What's wrong?

39:33.311 --> 39:35.054
We won, remember?

39:35.079 --> 39:37.250
We thought Hirst was
the king on the chessboard.

39:37.275 --> 39:39.042
Turns out she's just another piece.

39:39.097 --> 39:41.197
Roman's game isn't over, and here I am,

39:41.222 --> 39:42.252
I just arrested my mentor,

39:42.320 --> 39:43.954
the woman that got me this job.

39:44.008 --> 39:45.874
You got you this job.

39:45.991 --> 39:47.458
And even if she did help,

39:47.512 --> 39:50.314
you decide what to do next, right?

39:54.312 --> 39:56.113
Care for some company?

39:56.300 --> 39:58.034
Sure.

39:58.209 --> 40:01.902
So, dinner with your dad
didn't exactly go to plan.

40:01.953 --> 40:03.920
No, I like that you stood up to him.

40:04.336 --> 40:06.604
No one does that, not even me.

40:06.685 --> 40:09.286
But I wish you would
reconsider his offer.

40:09.311 --> 40:10.411
You said it yourself,

40:10.436 --> 40:11.803
you're looking for purpose, right?

40:11.828 --> 40:12.933
Being your bodyguard

40:12.958 --> 40:14.318
wasn't exactly what I had in mind.

40:14.448 --> 40:16.573
But this would just be a way in,

40:16.708 --> 40:18.373
and I know how smart you are

40:18.398 --> 40:19.798
and how passionate,

40:20.131 --> 40:21.865
and I can tell my father respects you,

40:21.914 --> 40:24.549
even if he doesn't like you yet.

40:25.163 --> 40:26.715
I promise you, if you're
looking for meaning,

40:26.740 --> 40:28.908
you can find it here.

40:29.073 --> 40:31.782
Besides... would guarding my body

40:31.897 --> 40:33.731
really be so horrible?

40:37.602 --> 40:40.270
I could think of worse things.

40:41.967 --> 40:43.367
All right, I'm in.

40:48.360 --> 40:49.760
Uck.

40:50.302 --> 40:51.769
Hello?

40:52.123 --> 40:53.423
It's Roman.

40:53.491 --> 40:56.193
- Give me the phone.
- What do you want?

40:56.761 --> 40:58.796
He wants to talk to you.

41:02.467 --> 41:04.788
<i>It sounds like you
had quite the day, Kurt.</i>

41:04.882 --> 41:07.817
Although I couldn't help
noticing Hirst is still alive.

41:07.961 --> 41:09.079
Roman, I...

41:09.104 --> 41:12.273
Relax. I've decided
not to tell Jane after all.

41:12.704 --> 41:15.931
<i>You and I have more work
to do, so congratulations.</i>

41:15.956 --> 41:17.231
<i>You're off the hook...</i>

41:17.256 --> 41:18.690
for now.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.300
What did he want?

41:23.899 --> 41:26.293
To congratulate us
on taking down Hirst.

41:26.497 --> 41:27.731
That's it?

41:28.266 --> 41:29.766
Yeah.

41:32.096 --> 41:33.096
Okay.

41:33.744 --> 41:35.412
Wait.

41:36.598 --> 41:39.603
There's something
that I have to tell you.

41:39.670 --> 41:42.103
I know you've been wrestling...

41:42.407 --> 41:44.608
whether to look
for your daughter or not,

41:44.682 --> 41:46.583
and I haven't been very useful in

41:46.608 --> 41:48.109
helping you make that decision.

41:48.193 --> 41:49.295
Look, I understand.

41:49.320 --> 41:51.254
No, you don't.

41:51.349 --> 41:53.083
The truth is, Jane,

41:53.464 --> 41:55.711
I don't want you to look for her

41:56.361 --> 41:58.529
because I know you won't find her.

41:58.650 --> 42:00.818
How do you know that?

42:00.878 --> 42:03.013
Because I...

42:03.168 --> 42:05.469
I killed your daughter.
