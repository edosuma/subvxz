00:02.330 --> 00:04.750
Previously on "How to Get Away
With Murder"...

00:04.750 --> 00:06.210
Testify against
Birkhead in court.

00:06.210 --> 00:08.380
Everything I've said on
the stand here has been a lie.

00:08.380 --> 00:10.000
I negotiated a new deal.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.330
What do you want?
Hannah agrees

00:11.330 --> 00:13.250
to be a witness for Annalise
at the trial.

00:13.250 --> 00:15.500
Hannah...
she and Sam had a baby.

00:15.500 --> 00:17.250
A boy.

00:17.250 --> 00:18.000
I just got off the phone
with Floyd.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.710
Birkhead did it.

00:19.710 --> 00:21.040
Or Frank.

00:26.380 --> 00:27.750
Officer: Get down!

00:28.960 --> 00:30.290
Request backup!
All units!

00:32.670 --> 00:34.120
Ophelia: What's going on,
Celestine?

00:34.120 --> 00:36.210
We don't know yet,
Mama.

00:36.210 --> 00:37.460
Anna Mae's out there
with those reporters!
Quimby: Everyone
on the floor now!

00:37.460 --> 00:39.880
Where's --
Where's my baby?!

00:39.880 --> 00:41.330
Hey!
Please tell me!
No.

00:41.330 --> 00:43.210
Is she hurt?!

00:47.290 --> 00:49.170
I begged you
not to tell Frank.

00:49.170 --> 00:51.000
Or do you just love
kicking me when I'm down?

00:51.000 --> 00:52.580
Annalise,
this was the Governor.

00:52.580 --> 00:54.080
She heard Hannah was about to
name her in court --

00:54.080 --> 00:55.750
And now Hannah
can't do that, can she?

00:55.750 --> 00:57.250
I'm just trying to
reason our way through this.

00:57.250 --> 00:58.040
We're dealing with
animals here.

00:58.040 --> 00:59.540
Reason means nothing to them.

00:59.540 --> 01:00.580
You can still win this.

01:00.580 --> 01:01.790
Not if I can't
prove conspiracy.

01:01.790 --> 01:03.420
So we'll work on that.

01:03.420 --> 01:06.210
Or I just jump off this balcony
and join Hannah in Hell.

01:08.500 --> 01:10.460
You gotta find Frank.

01:12.080 --> 01:14.380
Floyd: Police think suicide.

01:14.380 --> 01:18.040
Listen, I have to get
all her files at the office.

01:18.040 --> 01:20.040
Yeah, okay. Yeah.
Love you, too.

01:22.290 --> 01:23.790
Frank: Don't move.

01:23.790 --> 01:26.580
I just want to talk.

01:26.580 --> 01:28.580
About?

01:28.580 --> 01:30.170
My mother.

01:40.330 --> 01:42.620
Is Frank here?

01:42.620 --> 01:43.460
No.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.710
Bonnie,
Christopher's asleep.

01:54.920 --> 01:56.500
Bonnie:
Sorry.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.750
What's going on?

01:58.750 --> 02:02.040
I just screwed up.

02:06.750 --> 02:10.500
You know, I always hoped
you two would end up together.

02:12.620 --> 02:15.750
So you don't hate yourself
so much for abandoning him?

02:17.580 --> 02:19.670
Probably.

02:22.920 --> 02:25.500
I never wanted
to need him.

02:25.500 --> 02:27.920
'Cause I don't know
if he can take it.

02:27.920 --> 02:31.210
He says he can...but...

02:34.960 --> 02:38.330
If anyone can make him happy,
it's gonna be you.

02:39.580 --> 02:42.000
You're the one
who kept us together, Bonnie.

02:43.460 --> 02:45.000
We pretended
like it was Annalise,

02:45.000 --> 02:47.040
but it was always you
who kept us safe.

02:49.120 --> 02:51.000
I just wanted a family.

02:53.080 --> 02:55.040
Me too.

02:59.080 --> 03:01.210
Lennox: Mr. Castillo,
during the times

03:01.210 --> 03:02.960
that you were speaking
with your daughter, Laurel,

03:02.960 --> 03:06.170
how would you categorize
your relationship with her?

03:06.170 --> 03:07.540
Jorge: Troubled.

03:07.540 --> 03:08.880
Why?

03:08.880 --> 03:10.420
Did you ever catch
your daughter lying to you?

03:10.420 --> 03:12.080
Of course.

03:12.080 --> 03:15.080
When she was 14,
she lied about using cocaine --

03:15.080 --> 03:16.500
Behavior while a minor

03:16.500 --> 03:18.040
is improper
character evidence, Judge.

03:18.040 --> 03:20.170
Sustained.

03:20.170 --> 03:23.210
Let's, um, move on
to Governor Birkhead.

03:23.210 --> 03:25.830
Mr. Castillo,
have you ever met

03:25.830 --> 03:27.540
or spoken with
the Governor?
No.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.420
Have you ever contacted
the Governor

03:29.420 --> 03:31.290
or anyone
associated with her

03:31.290 --> 03:33.170
to enact ill will
against Ms. Keating?

03:33.170 --> 03:35.540
Absolutely not.

03:35.540 --> 03:37.670
And do you believe any
of the allegations that say

03:37.670 --> 03:41.120
the Governor was involved
in your son Xavier's death?

03:43.000 --> 03:45.460
No.
Why?

03:45.460 --> 03:47.790
I've made a lot of money
in my life --

03:47.790 --> 03:49.330
enemies, too --

03:49.330 --> 03:51.120
so I can think of
a long list of people

03:51.120 --> 03:53.330
who would have wanted to
see my son dead.

03:53.330 --> 03:54.830
Mr. Castillo,
one of the theories

03:54.830 --> 03:56.580
Ms. Keating has put forth

03:56.580 --> 04:00.330
is that the FBI is part
of this conspiracy against her.

04:00.330 --> 04:02.710
Have you been in contact
with the FBI about this?

04:02.710 --> 04:05.290
No. The FBI's
who put me in jail

04:05.290 --> 04:09.210
based on misinformation
from an informant.

04:09.210 --> 04:12.120
That's her sitting
right behind Ms. Keating.
Objection!

04:12.120 --> 04:13.880
Judge Vitkay: Mr. Castillo,
do not address the gallery.
Those two women
are conspiring against me.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.420
I'm censuring
the witness.

04:15.420 --> 04:17.500
Jury, disregard the last part
of his testimony.

04:17.500 --> 04:20.210
Mr. Lennox,
meet me in my chambers.

04:20.210 --> 04:22.210
Adjourned.

04:23.750 --> 04:25.330
Michaela: He's a sociopath.

04:25.330 --> 04:27.790
The Governor probably
bribed him with a pardon.

04:27.790 --> 04:29.540
Oliver: Or your dad didn't
want to be the next one killed.

04:29.540 --> 04:31.000
Well, he is gonna
be now.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.250
I just have to
figure out how.

04:32.250 --> 04:33.710
Don't you see
the irony here?

04:33.710 --> 04:35.710
Laurel's mad at her father
because he lied on the stand,

04:35.710 --> 04:36.920
and we all did
the same thing.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.080
Connor, don't
do this again.

04:38.080 --> 04:39.420
Do what?

04:39.420 --> 04:41.170
Maybe one of us
needs to tell the truth.

04:41.170 --> 04:42.830
The real truth.
That'll fix nothing.

04:42.830 --> 04:44.210
And my sentence
will be even longer.

04:44.210 --> 04:45.750
It's also
the right thing to do.

04:45.750 --> 04:47.710
No more lies,
no more guilt about the lies.

04:47.710 --> 04:48.620
I told you,
I don't have any guilt.

04:48.620 --> 04:50.620
Then you're a sociopath.

04:50.620 --> 04:51.830
And you've always been one.

04:51.830 --> 04:53.500
Oliver: Yeah, well, I'm not,
and you love me,

04:53.500 --> 04:55.120
so that means not sending
yourself to prison

04:55.120 --> 04:57.120
for even longer
than five years.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.330
Or sending Oliver to prison
'cause you voided his immunity.

04:59.330 --> 05:00.920
Hey.

05:00.920 --> 05:02.580
Say you're kidding.

05:02.580 --> 05:04.000
'Course I am.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.540
Ha ha.

05:05.540 --> 05:07.670
I'm gonna take a nap.

05:14.670 --> 05:17.210
Tegan:
I've got more bad news.

05:17.210 --> 05:19.380
There's a rumor Lennox
has a surprise witness on deck.

05:20.420 --> 05:21.750
I'm thinking Gabriel.

05:21.750 --> 05:23.670
Or Frank.

05:23.670 --> 05:24.880
Bonnie can't find him.

05:24.880 --> 05:27.120
Maybe he's out
negotiating his own deal.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.710
No. Frank is ride or die
for you, Annalise.

05:29.710 --> 05:30.830
Just like Bonnie,
just like me.

05:30.830 --> 05:31.830
Why?

05:31.830 --> 05:33.170
Huh?

05:33.170 --> 05:34.920
What's the opposite
of Midas Touch?

05:34.920 --> 05:36.170
Because that's my gift,

05:36.170 --> 05:38.120
of turning everything
around me into ass.

05:41.580 --> 05:43.380
I'm sorry.

05:43.380 --> 05:45.170
I get it.

05:45.170 --> 05:47.250
This is a very stressful
situation.

05:47.250 --> 05:49.210
Yeah, but me having
tantrums doesn't help.

05:49.210 --> 05:50.330
That is also true.

05:50.330 --> 05:52.210
And the main reason
I don't want children.

05:54.880 --> 05:57.120
Tegan.

05:57.120 --> 06:00.460
The witness is Wes.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.500
He wrote a confession,

06:02.500 --> 06:04.540
he hid it in
a safe deposit box --

06:04.540 --> 06:06.120
Let's not jump
to conclusions.

06:07.330 --> 06:09.710
Okay. I'll see
what I can find out.

06:14.210 --> 06:15.790
Get down! Get down!

06:17.330 --> 06:20.080
Is my baby hurt?
Please tell me!

06:20.080 --> 06:21.290
Mama, no!
Is she hurt?!

06:21.290 --> 06:23.500
No. Mama.
Please tell me!

06:29.330 --> 06:30.380
Drive!

06:30.380 --> 06:31.290
Drive right now!

06:35.960 --> 06:38.670
In case you weren't
kidding earlier

06:38.670 --> 06:40.040
and want to tell
the real truth just
to get back at me,

06:40.040 --> 06:43.080
you should know
Solomon made my deal iron-clad.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.460
You're not gonna be able to
live with yourself, Michaela.

06:45.460 --> 06:48.920
I know you say you will,
but it's gonna eat away at you.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.290
It's not.

06:50.290 --> 06:51.380
You can't know that.

06:51.380 --> 06:53.790
I already went to
prison, Connor.

06:53.790 --> 06:55.580
It's called my childhood.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.120
No one ever taught me
how to do my hair,

06:59.120 --> 07:01.040
wash myself, or read.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.750
I ate bait once

07:04.750 --> 07:07.040
because my father
forgot to feed me.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.670
My uncle showed
his affection

07:08.670 --> 07:11.540
by putting cigarettes out
on my skin.

07:11.540 --> 07:13.500
I can tell you
a hundred stories like that,

07:13.500 --> 07:15.120
or worse, but...

07:17.750 --> 07:19.170
I don't want to,

07:19.170 --> 07:21.540
because I worked
really hard to...

07:21.540 --> 07:23.540
forget and get out

07:23.540 --> 07:25.380
and become the damn miracle
that I am.

07:25.380 --> 07:26.960
So no.

07:26.960 --> 07:29.880
I'm not gonna choose to
suffer, if I don't have to.

07:31.330 --> 07:33.250
I've suffered enough.

07:36.330 --> 07:38.170
I went to Hannah's
safe deposit box.

07:38.170 --> 07:41.580
I got a copy of
her passport, the will.

07:41.580 --> 07:42.880
What else you got?

07:42.880 --> 07:44.120
That's all there is.

07:47.120 --> 07:48.620
Hey, look,

07:48.620 --> 07:50.380
my attorney's
on notice, okay?

07:50.380 --> 07:51.790
If I'm not back in
the office in 20 minutes,

07:51.790 --> 07:52.960
he's gonna call the police,

07:52.960 --> 07:55.620
he's gonna give them
your name.

07:55.620 --> 07:57.380
You found out my name?

07:58.960 --> 08:00.330
That means
there's more papers

08:00.330 --> 08:03.290
listing me
as Hannah's kid.

08:03.290 --> 08:05.670
Which means I have to
make your wife and kids sad

08:05.670 --> 08:06.960
and kill you
for lying to me.

08:06.960 --> 08:08.580
No. Please, no. Please.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.420
Lennox: Thank you
for being here, Governor.

08:13.420 --> 08:16.210
You say that
like I have a choice.

08:16.210 --> 08:19.670
Well, let's not
keep you too long, then.

08:19.670 --> 08:22.790
Did you order the death
of Nathaniel Lahey Sr.?

08:22.790 --> 08:24.580
No.

08:24.580 --> 08:27.460
Do you know if Xavier Castillo
ordered the death?

08:27.460 --> 08:30.120
Yes, because that guard
named him during the Civil Suit.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.460
Did you know
Xavier Castillo?

08:31.460 --> 08:34.790
No, nor have I ever met
or spoken to him.

08:34.790 --> 08:36.120
Do you know
his father, Jorge?

08:36.120 --> 08:37.460
No.

08:37.460 --> 08:38.880
Governor,
did you ever coordinate

08:38.880 --> 08:40.330
with any member
of the Castillo family

08:40.330 --> 08:41.500
or the FBI

08:41.500 --> 08:43.330
to exact revenge
on Ms. Keating

08:43.330 --> 08:45.620
for defeating you
in a Supreme Court case?

08:45.620 --> 08:47.040
No.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.790
You weren't protecting
your re-election?

08:48.790 --> 08:51.330
No, because I plan
to win my election

08:51.330 --> 08:54.960
by convincing the public
I'm the best person for the job.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.750
The way not to do that

08:56.750 --> 08:59.420
is to commit a series
of violent murders.

08:59.420 --> 09:01.330
That's more
Ms. Keating's fallback.

09:01.330 --> 09:03.170
Objection.
Censure the witness.

09:03.170 --> 09:04.120
Governor.

09:04.120 --> 09:05.210
My apologies.

09:05.210 --> 09:07.460
Lennox:
No further questions.

09:15.710 --> 09:16.920
Annalise:
Swear it wasn't you.

09:16.920 --> 09:19.250
Why would I kill Hannah?

09:19.250 --> 09:21.500
Why do you do anything,
Frank?

09:21.500 --> 09:24.710
You know
what you never get?

09:24.710 --> 09:26.920
Is that you're it for me.

09:26.920 --> 09:28.500
You got me
out of the pound.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.790
And sure, I mess up,

09:30.790 --> 09:32.830
but all I want to do now
is make you happy.

09:32.830 --> 09:35.380
No. That's never been
your job.

09:35.380 --> 09:37.540
It was Sam's.

09:37.540 --> 09:39.250
And he's who I'd kill
right now.

09:40.790 --> 09:44.750
He knew who I was,
and he used it against me,

09:44.750 --> 09:45.880
made me think I was sick.

09:45.880 --> 09:46.880
That's because
you reminded him

09:46.880 --> 09:48.920
of how sick he was.

09:51.880 --> 09:54.540
No more hating yourself.

10:03.670 --> 10:05.000
What's that?

10:05.000 --> 10:06.710
Frank:
You found out my name?

10:06.710 --> 10:10.580
That means there are more papers
listing me as Hannah's kid.

10:10.580 --> 10:13.000
Which means I have to
make your wife and kids sad

10:13.000 --> 10:14.210
and kill you
for lying to me.

10:14.210 --> 10:16.380
No. Please, no.
Please. No.

10:16.380 --> 10:19.000
It's not papers.
It's a flash drive.

10:20.460 --> 10:22.080
How you're gonna win.

10:24.620 --> 10:26.920
Annalise: Governor,
when I beat you
at the Supreme Court

10:26.920 --> 10:28.960
with my class action,
were you upset?

10:28.960 --> 10:30.710
More disappointed.

10:30.710 --> 10:32.750
Because of the damage to
your political career?

10:32.750 --> 10:34.330
To the taxpayer.

10:34.330 --> 10:36.170
Your victory
cost the state millions.

10:36.170 --> 10:37.170
Money well spent

10:37.170 --> 10:38.960
if it saved
thousands of poor people

10:38.960 --> 10:40.290
from unjust convictions.

10:40.290 --> 10:41.500
Argumentative.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.920
This speaks to the defense's
theory of motive.

10:43.920 --> 10:45.080
Sustained.

10:45.080 --> 10:46.710
Do you know
Xavier Castillo?

10:46.710 --> 10:48.880
As I stated earlier, no.

10:48.880 --> 10:50.290
What about
Hannah Keating?

10:52.580 --> 10:54.210
I don't know who that is.

10:54.210 --> 10:58.080
She's my deceased husband's
sister. Hannah.

10:58.080 --> 11:00.210
You don't know her?
I do not.

11:00.210 --> 11:02.540
And yet, Hannah Keating
recorded herself

11:02.540 --> 11:05.420
on a phone call
to Xavier Castillo

11:05.420 --> 11:07.380
saying this...

11:07.380 --> 11:08.580
Hannah: I just saw
the Governor on TV

11:08.580 --> 11:10.120
saying Nate Lahey Sr. died.

11:10.120 --> 11:11.460
Xavier: He did die.

11:11.460 --> 11:12.460
Because the Governor
killed him?

11:12.460 --> 11:14.500
Objection. We can't
authenticate this recording.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.000
I wish Hannah Keating were here

11:16.000 --> 11:17.500
to speak to its authenticity,

11:17.500 --> 11:18.710
but she just died.

11:18.710 --> 11:19.710
Gunshot to the head.

11:19.710 --> 11:22.420
Your Honor.

11:22.420 --> 11:23.880
Falls under
the death exception.

11:23.880 --> 11:24.960
I'll allow it.

11:26.790 --> 11:28.330
I just saw
the Governor on TV

11:28.330 --> 11:30.380
saying
Nate Lahey Sr. died.
He did die.

11:30.380 --> 11:32.460
Because the Governor
killed him?
Calm down.

11:32.460 --> 11:34.210
I wanted Annalise
to go down for my brother,

11:34.210 --> 11:35.670
not hurt all these
other people.

11:35.670 --> 11:36.960
I'm hanging up.

11:38.880 --> 11:42.210
If you didn't know
Hannah Keating
or Xavier Castillo,

11:42.210 --> 11:44.380
why are they speaking
so intimately about you?

11:44.380 --> 11:45.830
I have no idea.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.380
What about
Nate Lahey Sr.?

11:47.380 --> 11:49.290
Did you do what Hannah said
and kill him?

11:49.290 --> 11:50.670
Absolutely not.

11:50.670 --> 11:52.920
So, if Xavier and Hannah
were alive to testify,

11:52.920 --> 11:54.040
they would say
the same thing?

11:54.040 --> 11:55.380
Objection.
Did you have them killed

11:55.380 --> 11:56.920
to cover up your lies?
No! My --

11:56.920 --> 11:57.960
Enough! Enough!
Judge, call a recess!

11:57.960 --> 11:59.330
I'm ending this cross!

11:59.330 --> 12:01.710
Good. I'm done
with this witness.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.290
So, why am I here?
Due to Xavier's death,

12:19.290 --> 12:20.330
we reached out
to the Attorney General

12:20.330 --> 12:22.380
and got him to re-offer
a settlement

12:22.380 --> 12:24.420
on your father's
wrongful death suit.

12:24.420 --> 12:27.420
It's a, uh --
a better offer than before.

12:27.420 --> 12:28.880
This so I don't do
a Laurel Castillo

12:28.880 --> 12:30.290
and flip on the stand?

12:30.290 --> 12:32.290
Or 'cause Annalise
just exposed Birkhead?

12:32.290 --> 12:34.710
It's more us wanting to do
the right thing for you.

12:34.710 --> 12:36.500
You can do the right thing
by prosecuting the Governor.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.040
Nate...

12:38.040 --> 12:39.420
you might as well
just look at the offer

12:39.420 --> 12:41.250
before saying no.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.120
Tegan: The AG just offered Nate
$20 million.

12:51.120 --> 12:53.330
I'm gonna cut out
his damn heart.

12:53.330 --> 12:56.210
No. You need to
play it cool.

12:56.210 --> 12:58.040
Oh, hell no.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.710
I told you,
he's the surprise witness.

13:01.710 --> 13:04.460
Dead witness, as soon as
I get my hands on him.

13:05.830 --> 13:07.460
Tegan.

13:07.460 --> 13:08.580
Go away.

13:08.580 --> 13:09.920
We need to talk
about my father.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.250
You played me, amiga.

13:13.250 --> 13:15.040
He killed my mother,
okay?

13:15.040 --> 13:17.080
Just imagine what
he could do to hurt us.

13:17.080 --> 13:18.250
You hurt me, Laurel.

13:18.250 --> 13:20.750
So save your own ass
this time.

13:20.750 --> 13:22.460
I have property.

13:22.460 --> 13:25.880
My father put it in my name.
It is worth millions.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.670
Really?

13:27.670 --> 13:31.120
And what exactly am I supposed
to do for those millions?

13:31.120 --> 13:33.620
Something that will
help both of us.

13:37.710 --> 13:39.580
Mr. Lahey,
did the Attorney General

13:39.580 --> 13:42.170
offer you $20 million
to testify against me?

13:44.210 --> 13:46.170
Why did you need
to make an immunity deal

13:46.170 --> 13:48.120
to get on the stand today?

13:48.120 --> 13:50.210
Were you violent with me
in my home recently?

13:50.210 --> 13:51.670
Did you confront D.A. Miller

13:51.670 --> 13:53.000
because you thought
he killed your father?

13:55.080 --> 13:56.670
Do you know
how D.A. Miller died?

13:56.670 --> 13:59.830
Mr. Lahey, did you have
an affair on your wife, Nia?

13:59.830 --> 14:01.540
How did Nia die?

14:01.540 --> 14:03.210
Did you euthanize her,
or did you beat her in the head

14:03.210 --> 14:04.790
the way you did D.A. Miller?

14:04.790 --> 14:06.250
Because that's the animal
you are.

14:06.250 --> 14:07.620
Violence lives inside of you,

14:07.620 --> 14:09.500
and the only way you know
how to stay out of jail

14:09.500 --> 14:11.460
is to make up lies about me!

14:11.460 --> 14:13.120
Someone who loved you!
Who fought for you!

14:13.120 --> 14:14.710
But you don't deserve it,
do you?

14:14.710 --> 14:17.120
Because you're just like
Sam and Solomon! Mac! Clyde!

14:17.120 --> 14:19.250
You're no better
than any of them!

14:32.620 --> 14:34.330
Bonnie:
What are you doing?

14:34.330 --> 14:35.500
It's nothing bad.

14:44.330 --> 14:46.750

14:48.620 --> 14:49.830
And it's all bad,

14:49.830 --> 14:53.210
so Annalise was right
not to tell me...

14:53.210 --> 14:55.830
and you should've
known that, too.

14:55.830 --> 14:58.790
I couldn't have
another lie between us.

14:58.790 --> 15:00.500
So you put
the burden on me?

15:00.500 --> 15:02.960
It's on us.

15:02.960 --> 15:07.000
And you just need to
let me be here for you.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.620
Then you should put
a bullet in my head.

15:10.620 --> 15:13.790
'Cause that would have been
nicer than what you did.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Please.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.670
Stay.

15:25.080 --> 15:27.750

16:05.580 --> 16:07.210
I paid the rent to
the end of the month.

16:07.210 --> 16:09.040
Well, now you can afford
a nicer place.

16:11.670 --> 16:14.250
It's 87 grand.

16:14.250 --> 16:15.920
Yours.

16:15.920 --> 16:18.120
Just don't take the stand
against Annalise.

16:20.250 --> 16:21.460
You're hung up
on your dad, right?

16:21.460 --> 16:23.500
That's what
all this is about?

16:23.500 --> 16:26.210
Wouldn't you be?

16:26.210 --> 16:28.250
He killed that girl Lila.

16:28.250 --> 16:29.460
Don't forget that.

16:29.460 --> 16:30.750
I don't believe
he did that.

16:30.750 --> 16:32.290
He did.

16:32.290 --> 16:34.880
You know how I know?

16:34.880 --> 16:37.250
'Cause he had me do it.

16:37.250 --> 16:40.290
Didn't know she was
pregnant at the time.

16:40.290 --> 16:42.670
Sad, right?

16:42.670 --> 16:45.620
Your dad had me kill
your sibling.

16:46.670 --> 16:48.710
Take the money.

16:48.710 --> 16:50.920
Get away from all this,

16:50.920 --> 16:52.500
or Sam's gonna
destroy your life,

16:52.500 --> 16:54.040
like he's done
everyone else.

16:54.040 --> 16:56.710
♪ Than the one we knew ♪

17:02.580 --> 17:04.670
Maybe I should go to law school.

17:04.670 --> 17:05.830
What?
Good luck.

17:05.830 --> 17:07.460
Look, I just snuck into
the law library

17:07.460 --> 17:09.710
to find ways to make the FBI
give you Michaela's deal.

17:09.710 --> 17:10.670
Oli, stop.

17:10.670 --> 17:11.880
You are depressed.

17:11.880 --> 17:13.040
That is very clear.

17:13.040 --> 17:14.420
So it's my job
to take the wheel.

17:14.420 --> 17:17.170
I want to go
to prison!

17:17.170 --> 17:18.710
Why do I have to
keep saying that?

17:18.710 --> 17:20.120
Especially to you,
my husband,

17:20.120 --> 17:22.040
who's supposed to
understand

17:22.040 --> 17:24.330
and honor what I think's
best for me.

17:24.330 --> 17:26.460
What about
what's best for me?

17:26.460 --> 17:28.540
Have you even
thought about that?
Of course.

17:28.540 --> 17:30.290
Look,
I need you to fight like hell

17:30.290 --> 17:32.380
to get the same deal
that Michaela got!

17:32.380 --> 17:33.750
So that we, the two people

17:33.750 --> 17:36.080
who vowed to love each other
'til death,

17:36.080 --> 17:39.460
can stay in love,
because I still love you,

17:39.460 --> 17:41.750
despite everything that
I've lost for you --

17:41.750 --> 17:43.120
my job, my morals.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.380
So, you owe me this.

17:45.380 --> 17:48.580
If you don't agree,
then I'll just divorce you.

17:48.580 --> 17:50.170
Right now.

17:53.460 --> 17:54.540
Okay.

17:54.540 --> 17:56.170
I'm sorry.

18:02.330 --> 18:03.580
Michaela:
Your phone, Connor.

18:03.580 --> 18:04.380
Who is it?

18:05.960 --> 18:07.500
Lanford.

18:09.580 --> 18:11.290
We're altering
your plea deal.

18:11.290 --> 18:14.080
No. I testified against
Annalise, like you wanted.

18:14.080 --> 18:16.000
We're improving
the terms, Connor.

18:18.170 --> 18:19.500
Why?

18:20.960 --> 18:23.880
I didn't like that you got
a different deal than Ms. Pratt.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.540
We've cut it down to
no years and probation.

18:26.540 --> 18:29.120
I don't get it.
You don't have to do this.

18:29.120 --> 18:32.080
No. We don't.

18:40.250 --> 18:42.250
Lennox: Mr. Lahey, were you
involved in any way at all

18:42.250 --> 18:44.290
with the death
of Sam Keating?

18:44.290 --> 18:46.380
No.
You were arrested

18:46.380 --> 18:48.250
and almost charged
for his murder, though. Why?

18:55.920 --> 18:58.830
I was the boyfriend.
That's always the first suspect.

18:58.830 --> 19:01.170
Any other reason?

19:01.170 --> 19:02.710
I was framed.

19:05.540 --> 19:07.380
I'm on it.

19:07.380 --> 19:10.460
You set me up for a murder you
probably committed yourself.

19:10.460 --> 19:12.790
Lennox: Who do you believe
framed you, Mr. Lahey?

19:12.790 --> 19:15.080
At the time,
I thought Annalise.

19:15.080 --> 19:18.290
Did you ever get
confirmation of this?

19:18.290 --> 19:22.040
I hate what I did to you.
I hate it.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.580
I hate myself.

19:25.380 --> 19:26.580
No.

19:26.580 --> 19:28.000
'Cause she wasn't
the one who framed me.

19:32.580 --> 19:34.580
You mean she had
an associate do it for her?

19:34.580 --> 19:37.170
I mean she didn't do it.

19:37.170 --> 19:39.500
That was Hannah Keating.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.620
She wanted to connect Annalise
to Sam's murder,

19:41.620 --> 19:44.380
and now it's very clear
to me how Hannah did it --

19:44.380 --> 19:46.080
by using the Castillos
and the Governor.

19:46.080 --> 19:49.920
Let me stop you,
Mr. Lahey.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.830
Did Ms. Keating coerce you
to change your testimony today?

19:52.830 --> 19:54.460
No.

19:54.460 --> 19:57.380
That was you
and Special Agent Lanford,

19:57.380 --> 20:00.380
when you offered me $20 million
to say what you want.

20:00.380 --> 20:02.790
I'm just guessing that's
so I don't tell the jury

20:02.790 --> 20:05.540
that an FBI agent
working for the Castillos

20:05.540 --> 20:07.580
murdered Asher Millstone.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.330
Annalise: Why?

20:15.330 --> 20:16.960
And don't say
because I got the Governor.

20:16.960 --> 20:18.460
I didn't.
No.

20:18.460 --> 20:19.880
It's got nothing to do
with the Governor.

20:19.880 --> 20:22.580
You gave up $20 million
for what?

20:22.580 --> 20:24.460
I didn't give it up.
I'mma get it.

20:24.460 --> 20:25.380
Nate.

20:25.380 --> 20:27.210
I hated you
for a long time,

20:27.210 --> 20:28.500
and even when
we were together,

20:28.500 --> 20:31.750
I-I think I thought
I was gonna get you back,

20:31.750 --> 20:33.750
but it wasn't just you.

20:33.750 --> 20:36.170
It was me.

20:36.170 --> 20:39.830
It was me. I made the first
move at the bar that night.

20:39.830 --> 20:44.330
But if I'm gonna move on --
I mean, really move on...

20:44.330 --> 20:46.750
I gotta own
my side of the road.

20:46.750 --> 20:49.790
Today was that.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.250
I...
Don't.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.210
Don't say anything.

20:53.210 --> 20:55.750
Just try it.

20:55.750 --> 20:58.750
Take responsibility
for how you ended up here.

20:58.750 --> 21:01.000
'Cause you're good at
a lot of things, Annalise.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.290
That's not one of them.

21:07.750 --> 21:08.790
Here.

21:08.790 --> 21:10.750
What's this?

21:10.750 --> 21:13.250
Wes' confession.

21:13.250 --> 21:14.960
Found it on Xavier.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.960
Goodbye, Annalise.

21:47.080 --> 21:48.460
Connor:
Is Michaela here?

21:48.460 --> 21:49.960
No, I sent her out
for Buster's.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.210
Here.
Two Manhattans.

21:52.210 --> 21:53.880
What are we celebrating?

21:53.880 --> 21:57.880
Uh, I wanted to apologize
for blowing up earlier.

21:57.880 --> 22:00.670
It's not because you knew
I was getting a new deal?

22:03.000 --> 22:04.670
You were never
at the library.

22:06.210 --> 22:08.460
You were with Lanford,

22:08.460 --> 22:11.290
agreeing to surprise Annalise
and testify against her

22:11.290 --> 22:12.710
as long as he gave me
a new deal.

22:22.620 --> 22:25.620
♪ I'm standing
at the riverside ♪

22:33.210 --> 22:34.580
What the hell?

22:34.580 --> 22:36.620
As if we could
stay away?

22:37.790 --> 22:39.380
Hug me now.

22:39.380 --> 22:41.000
Oh.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.670
Celestine: We're here to
watch you win, sis.

22:42.670 --> 22:44.670
Ophelia:
It's alright, baby.

22:44.670 --> 22:46.170
We're here.

22:47.620 --> 22:49.080
What lies
did you agree to?

22:49.080 --> 22:53.250
Just to say that
Annalise made me delete...

22:53.250 --> 22:55.790
some dirty photos
of her and Wes

22:55.790 --> 22:57.330
from her hard drive.

22:57.330 --> 22:59.290
Well, now you don't
have to tell that lie.

22:59.290 --> 23:00.670
No. I will say
whatever it takes --

23:00.670 --> 23:03.500
I want a divorce, Oli.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.500
I refused the deal.

23:09.500 --> 23:12.580
I go to prison as soon
as the trial's over.

23:12.580 --> 23:15.120
And I'm not gonna ruin
your life for that entire time.

23:17.620 --> 23:20.460
This -- This is not
your decision to make.

23:20.460 --> 23:23.790
Your testimony could make
Annalise lose her trial,

23:23.790 --> 23:25.880
and that -- that means
Laurel goes to prison

23:25.880 --> 23:27.500
and Christopher's alone.
I'm all alone

23:27.500 --> 23:28.960
if you go through
with this.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.380
Only until
you meet someone

23:30.380 --> 23:31.670
who's actually good
for you.
No, that's you.

23:31.670 --> 23:32.920
I've turned you
into a criminal.

23:32.920 --> 23:34.460
I made myself into that.

23:34.460 --> 23:35.790
And none of that
would have happened

23:35.790 --> 23:38.670
if I hadn't showed up
to your door the night of Sam.

23:38.670 --> 23:40.880
That's the only thing
keeping us together.

23:40.880 --> 23:44.250
Death, murder, and trauma.

23:44.250 --> 23:46.080
And that's gonna
follow us, always...

23:46.080 --> 23:47.580
No.
...if we stay together.

23:47.580 --> 23:48.830
No.
You don't get to do this.

23:48.830 --> 23:49.880
I made my decision.

23:49.880 --> 23:51.170
I know
you still love me.

23:51.170 --> 23:52.750
We're done.
No.

23:52.750 --> 23:55.080
L-Look at me.

23:55.080 --> 23:57.210
Look at me.

23:57.210 --> 23:59.750
And tell me
that you don't love me.

23:59.750 --> 24:01.380
Say it.

24:01.380 --> 24:03.330
I want to
hear you say it.

24:04.420 --> 24:06.580
See?

24:06.580 --> 24:08.330
You can't.

24:10.250 --> 24:12.500
You can't say it.

24:12.500 --> 24:15.790
You love me.

24:15.790 --> 24:18.080
I don't love you.

24:36.120 --> 24:38.920
You're gonna win
this one, right?

24:38.920 --> 24:40.040
You're not gonna
bring shame

24:40.040 --> 24:43.330
to the Harkness brand,
are you?

24:43.330 --> 24:45.580
What if
I shouldn't win, Mama?

24:45.580 --> 24:47.250
What?

24:48.670 --> 24:51.540
It's easy to want to win
when it's right.

24:53.540 --> 24:55.120
But this?

24:56.880 --> 24:58.790
Me?

24:58.790 --> 25:00.670
What are you saying,
Anna Mae?

25:02.330 --> 25:04.710
I've done a lot
of bad things, Mama.

25:06.540 --> 25:08.170
If people only knew.

25:10.830 --> 25:13.120
What if I deserve to lose?

25:15.670 --> 25:18.120
That's not
your decision to make.

25:19.540 --> 25:23.580
It's the jury's,
and I have to give a closing

25:23.580 --> 25:26.210
convincing them
that I deserve to be free.

25:26.210 --> 25:30.290
It's God's decision,
Anna Mae.

25:30.290 --> 25:33.290
God is the only one who can
look at the whole picture

25:33.290 --> 25:37.290
and decide
who deserves what.

25:37.290 --> 25:39.710
Not you,

25:39.710 --> 25:41.210
not that jury,

25:41.210 --> 25:43.330
not your mama.

25:43.330 --> 25:46.170
All you have to do
is show up,

25:46.170 --> 25:47.540
and I know you
well enough to know

25:47.540 --> 25:51.750
that you know damn well
how to show up when it counts.

25:55.290 --> 25:56.380
You hear me?

25:58.500 --> 26:00.790
Lennox:
Forget everyone else.

26:00.790 --> 26:03.460
The Castillos, the Governor,

26:03.460 --> 26:05.380
the supposed conspiracy.

26:05.380 --> 26:08.080
That is all noise

26:08.080 --> 26:12.290
to distract you from the person
who brought us here --

26:12.290 --> 26:14.040
Annalise Keating.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.460
She wants to play
the victim,

26:15.460 --> 26:18.290
and she is good at it, too.

26:18.290 --> 26:20.790
But you know the real victims.

26:20.790 --> 26:22.960
Asher Millstone.

26:22.960 --> 26:24.920
D.A. Ronald Miller.

26:24.920 --> 26:27.880
A.D.A. Emily Sinclair.

26:27.880 --> 26:30.790
Rebecca Sutter.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.460
Sam Keating.

26:34.290 --> 26:37.000
It all started with this man.

26:50.830 --> 26:53.210
I'm sorry.

26:57.120 --> 26:59.710
Lennox:
That is the original sin.

26:59.710 --> 27:01.210
You start there.

27:01.210 --> 27:03.960
Then there's no doubt

27:03.960 --> 27:07.960
that Annalise Keating
is not a victim.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.380
She's a murderer.

27:13.880 --> 27:15.250
Annalise: I'm no victim.

27:16.830 --> 27:20.330
USA Lennox
was right about that.

27:20.330 --> 27:24.500
But that's the only true thing
that he said today.

27:24.500 --> 27:27.580
So, here's the truth about me.

27:27.580 --> 27:31.290
I've worn a mask
every day of my life.

27:33.210 --> 27:35.290
In high school,
it was a smile that I faked

27:35.290 --> 27:37.540
to get boys to like me.

27:37.540 --> 27:41.500
In law school, I changed my name
to sound more "New England."

27:41.500 --> 27:46.250
At the law firm, I wore heels,
makeup, and a wig.

27:46.250 --> 27:49.960
And when I got married, I...

27:49.960 --> 27:54.040
threw myself into
becoming a Keating,

27:54.040 --> 27:56.250
and it was all to create
a version of myself

27:56.250 --> 27:58.750
that the world would accept.

27:58.750 --> 28:01.670
But I'm done.

28:03.710 --> 28:08.710
Instead, I stand before you,
mask off,

28:08.710 --> 28:12.080
to tell you the God's honest.

28:12.080 --> 28:15.920
I have done many a bad thing.

28:15.920 --> 28:19.330
I've coerced witnesses,

28:19.330 --> 28:22.040
got clients to lie on the stand,

28:22.040 --> 28:25.000
bullied students to tears,

28:25.000 --> 28:28.540
manipulated jurors like you.

28:28.540 --> 28:31.880
But those are not the crimes
I'm being tried for.

28:31.880 --> 28:34.040
It's murder.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.880
And I am no murderer.

28:41.830 --> 28:44.460
What I am is a survivor.

28:46.500 --> 28:48.830
I survived getting taunted
by the N-word

28:48.830 --> 28:51.750
when I was in grade school.

28:51.750 --> 28:56.880
I survived the sexual abuse
by my uncle when I was 11.

28:56.880 --> 28:59.330
I survived losing
my first love, Eve,

28:59.330 --> 29:02.080
because I was scared to be gay.

29:03.750 --> 29:07.460
Then the death of my son
in a car accident,

29:07.460 --> 29:09.580
the murder of my husband,

29:09.580 --> 29:11.750
then alcoholism,

29:11.750 --> 29:14.420
depression, grief,

29:14.420 --> 29:19.120
and every death
leading up to this trial.

29:19.120 --> 29:21.120
But today, you decide.

29:23.460 --> 29:25.540
Am I a bad person?

29:27.460 --> 29:31.170
Well, the mask is off,
so I'm gonna say yes.

29:31.170 --> 29:33.210
But am I the mastermind criminal

29:33.210 --> 29:35.960
who pulled off a series
of violent murders?

29:35.960 --> 29:37.790
Hell no.

29:41.210 --> 29:43.960
Who I am is a 53-year-old woman

29:43.960 --> 29:45.880
from Memphis, Tennessee,

29:45.880 --> 29:48.620
named Anna Mae Harkness.

29:50.000 --> 29:54.500
I'm ambitious, black,

29:54.500 --> 29:58.710
bisexual, angry,

29:58.710 --> 30:02.670
sad, strong,

30:02.670 --> 30:06.620
sensitive, scared,

30:06.620 --> 30:09.710
fierce, talented,

30:09.710 --> 30:12.000
exhausted.

30:16.210 --> 30:18.500
And I am at your mercy.

30:24.710 --> 30:26.750
Say it.

30:28.750 --> 30:32.000
You think I was dumb
to say all that.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.670
No.

30:36.120 --> 30:37.830
I think I'm in love
with you, Annalise.

30:40.040 --> 30:42.920
I've tried to fight it.

30:42.920 --> 30:45.420
But I'm taking
my mask off, too.

30:45.420 --> 30:50.920
I cannot not
have you in my life.

30:50.920 --> 30:53.170
Because I love you.

30:59.170 --> 31:01.750
What do you really want?

31:03.170 --> 31:05.120
Love.

31:06.290 --> 31:08.580
And I can give that
to you.

31:08.580 --> 31:10.290
I can make you happy.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.920
I can't promise you
the same.

31:17.670 --> 31:20.000
That's what you deserve,

31:20.000 --> 31:22.920
and it's out there
for you,

31:22.920 --> 31:24.790
but it's just not me.

31:31.830 --> 31:34.290
There's a verdict.

31:43.580 --> 31:45.960
Ms. Foreperson, I've been told
you've reached a verdict.

31:45.960 --> 31:47.580
Yes, Your Honor.

32:08.920 --> 32:10.620
Please stand.

32:19.670 --> 32:22.080
For the charge of conspiracy
to murder Sam Keating

32:22.080 --> 32:23.960
in count one of the indictment,

32:23.960 --> 32:26.540
the jury finds the defendant
Annalise Keating...

32:33.790 --> 32:35.620
...not guilty.

32:35.620 --> 32:36.960
Woman: Yes.

32:36.960 --> 32:38.710
For murder in the first degree
of Rebecca Sutter,

32:38.710 --> 32:41.710
the jury finds the defendant
not guilty.

32:41.710 --> 32:43.710
For murder in the first degree
of Asher Millstone,

32:43.710 --> 32:47.080
the jury finds the defendant
not guilty.

32:47.080 --> 32:49.380
For murder in the first degree
of Emily Sinclair,

32:49.380 --> 32:52.380
the jury finds the defendant
not guilty.

32:52.380 --> 32:54.170
For murder in the first degree
of Ronald Miller,

32:54.170 --> 32:57.290
the jury finds the defendant
not guilty.

32:57.290 --> 32:59.880
For murder in the first degree
of Caleb Hapstall,

32:59.880 --> 33:03.120
the jury finds the defendant
not guilty.

33:03.120 --> 33:05.080
For the charges of
abuse of a corpse...

33:14.790 --> 33:16.620
Reporter: How are you
feeling, Annalise?

33:16.620 --> 33:18.670
I'm grateful that the jury
did the right thing,

33:18.670 --> 33:21.880
despite some pressure from
some very powerful people.

33:21.880 --> 33:23.210
You mean
the Governor?

33:23.210 --> 33:24.790
And others.

33:26.210 --> 33:27.540
Reporter #2:
Are you concerned about

33:27.540 --> 33:29.540
a backlash from the FBI?

33:29.540 --> 33:31.920
If they're truly behind
Asher Millstone's death,

33:31.920 --> 33:33.330
then I'm very concerned,

33:33.330 --> 33:34.540
and you should be, too.

33:42.540 --> 33:43.750
Marshal:
It's time, sir.

33:46.920 --> 33:48.620
Okay.

33:54.500 --> 33:55.960
No.

33:55.960 --> 33:57.170
Uh -- Uh, no.

33:57.170 --> 33:58.670
I'm -- I'm not --

33:58.670 --> 34:00.080
I'm not doing this.

34:00.080 --> 34:01.880
I'm -- I'm not gonna
sign those papers.

34:01.880 --> 34:03.750
I know better.
You're gonna be happy.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.920
I know better, okay?

34:05.920 --> 34:07.750
Oliver.
No.

34:09.290 --> 34:11.170
Thank you.

34:13.170 --> 34:15.210
Now I know how to love.

34:18.380 --> 34:19.420
Connor.

34:19.420 --> 34:21.580
Connor! Connor.

34:28.460 --> 34:30.540
Oh, God.

34:32.960 --> 34:35.000
I'm so sorry --
Don't!

34:36.500 --> 34:38.250
That should have
been you.

34:53.960 --> 34:56.670
Female voice: The number you are
calling has been disconnected.

34:56.670 --> 34:58.580
Please check the number
and dial again.

35:05.830 --> 35:09.330
Laurel: We get to go
somewhere new, meet new people.

35:09.330 --> 35:12.290
Mommy promises
no more boogey men, okay?

35:12.290 --> 35:15.670
We get to be safe and happy.

35:19.580 --> 35:21.170
No!

35:36.380 --> 35:37.500
Reporter #2:
What legal action do you think

35:37.500 --> 35:39.670
should be taken
against the Governor?

35:39.670 --> 35:42.210
There needs to be an independent
counsel investigation

35:42.210 --> 35:43.580
on the Governor immediately,

35:43.580 --> 35:45.380
or we need to impeach
right away.

35:45.380 --> 35:47.420
Reporter: Would you ever
consider being the prosecutor

35:47.420 --> 35:50.120
to try the Governor's case?
Laurel: Esta bien.
Okay, precioso?

35:56.960 --> 35:59.500
Female minister: May the Lord
bless her and keep her,

35:59.500 --> 36:02.000
the Lord shine upon her
and be gracious to her.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.330
We ask you, o Lord,

36:04.330 --> 36:08.170
to lift up
our dearly departed Annalise

36:08.170 --> 36:09.920
and give her peace.

36:09.920 --> 36:11.170
Amen.

36:11.170 --> 36:12.380
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.

36:12.380 --> 36:14.620
And now we invite all those
who would like

36:14.620 --> 36:16.960
to come up and share
their own thoughts, memories,

36:16.960 --> 36:18.670
and prayers for Annalise.

36:18.670 --> 36:21.170
First, we'll begin
with a special speaker

36:21.170 --> 36:23.880
who has known Annalise
for a long time.

36:23.880 --> 36:25.960
Reporter: Are you concerned
about a backlash from the FBI?

36:25.960 --> 36:28.960
Well, if they were truly behind
Asher Millstone's murder,

36:28.960 --> 36:30.380
you better believe
I'm concerned,

36:30.380 --> 36:31.830
and you should be, too.

36:31.830 --> 36:33.960
We can't tolerate
this level of corruption

36:33.960 --> 36:35.670
in our law enforcement.

36:35.670 --> 36:37.000
Reporter #2: Ms. Keating,
there's speculation

36:37.000 --> 36:38.960
you wouldn't have gotten
this not guilty verdict

36:38.960 --> 36:40.290
if you hadn't made the trial

36:40.290 --> 36:42.000
all about the Governor
and the FBI.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.880
I would never presume
to know why

36:43.880 --> 36:45.580
the jury decided
to side with me.

36:45.580 --> 36:47.670
Either way,
it's clear that they saw through

36:47.670 --> 36:50.920
Governor Birkhead's weak attempt
to make me the guilty party here

36:50.920 --> 36:53.210
when it's actually her.

36:53.210 --> 36:54.790
Were you aware
the Governor's here today?

36:54.790 --> 36:58.080
Probably here to
watch me win.

36:58.080 --> 37:00.380
Uh, no. She's meeting
with the Attorney General.

37:00.380 --> 37:03.500
Well, I assume
that she is concerned...

37:03.500 --> 37:04.790
Get out of the way,
please.

37:04.790 --> 37:06.000
...that she will be charged
with conspiracy,

37:06.000 --> 37:07.710
along with FBI Agent Lanford.

37:07.710 --> 37:09.380
Move, please.
Reporter:
Would you agree to testify

37:09.380 --> 37:11.380

impeachment trial?
