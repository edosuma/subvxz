00:10.720 --> 00:14.098
Gotham City on a <i>fresh new</i> day...

00:14.516 --> 00:19.103
<i>...which may be fraught
with fresh new danger.</i>

00:20.313 --> 00:22.774
Olga, wait for me! Olga!

00:22.941 --> 00:25.193
Olga, wait for me!

00:25.360 --> 00:27.111
Olga! Giddyap.

00:33.034 --> 00:36.120
The Bessarovian Cossacks and Egghead.

00:36.287 --> 00:39.290
But that street leads directly
to police headquarters.

00:39.457 --> 00:41.459
Have they gone mad?

00:47.131 --> 00:49.801
Bonnie, where is that sandwich I ordered?

00:49.968 --> 00:53.513
<i>It just arrived, Commissioner Gordon.
I'll send the delivery boy in.</i>

00:53.680 --> 00:55.223
Thank you.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074

01:07.652 --> 01:11.823
Oh, oh. Thank you, thank you.
Here's a little something for you.

01:11.990 --> 01:13.074
Thank you, sir.

01:13.241 --> 01:14.325
You're very welcome.

01:21.624 --> 01:25.211
Wait a minute. What's going on?
I ordered a roast beef sandwich.

01:25.378 --> 01:28.339
- This is a poached egg sandwich.
-You don't say.

01:28.506 --> 01:30.758
- Heh, heh, heh.
-Yes, I do say--

01:32.635 --> 01:34.846
A poached egg sandwich?

01:35.013 --> 01:38.224
At your service, commissioner.

01:38.391 --> 01:42.228
No, no, no, please. No publicity.
I'm very shy, you know.

01:42.395 --> 01:45.398
You'll find it more difficult to get out
than in, Egghead.

01:45.565 --> 01:50.612
Oh, I've already made arrangements
for my eggs-it, commissioner.

01:57.285 --> 02:00.288
You are taking short elevator ride with us.

02:00.455 --> 02:02.248
You two will never get away with this.

02:02.415 --> 02:06.210
Oh, really, commissioner,
I wish someone would write you a new line.

02:06.377 --> 02:08.713
That one is getting so tired. Heh, heh.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.548
Shall we?

02:28.024 --> 02:30.193
Unh. Heh, heh.

02:30.943 --> 02:34.947
There. Up we go, me hearties. Heh, heh.

04:02.452 --> 04:03.661
Kidnapped?

04:03.828 --> 04:06.664
The commissioner's been kidnapped?

04:13.171 --> 04:15.131
Batgirl.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.011
Thank heavens you're here.

04:20.178 --> 04:22.012
But why are you here?

04:22.180 --> 04:25.057
Shall we say a hunch, Chief O'Hara?

04:25.224 --> 04:28.853
Some sixth sense
that things aren't quite right in Gotham City.

04:29.020 --> 04:31.898
Not only in Gotham City, but in this office.

04:32.064 --> 04:35.026
- The commissioner has been kidnapped.
-Kidnapped?

04:35.193 --> 04:38.529
My fa--
Commissioner Gordon kidnapped?

04:38.780 --> 04:41.741
Somehow he managed to drop this note.

04:41.908 --> 04:43.367
But it doesn't say much.

04:43.534 --> 04:45.620
I was about to call his daughter Barbara.

04:45.787 --> 04:48.623
But she'd likely worry herself to death.

04:48.790 --> 04:50.374
Right, Chief O'Hara.

04:50.541 --> 04:54.086
Don't call until we know the identities
and demands of the kidnappers.

04:54.545 --> 04:56.214
Kidnappers?

04:58.007 --> 05:01.052
Our fine police commissioner's
been abducted, Batman.

05:01.219 --> 05:02.804
Out of this very room.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.598
Whoever could have done
such a dastardly deed?

05:05.765 --> 05:09.435
Very likely our arch-foe,
that eggs-arable Egghead.

05:09.602 --> 05:13.606
And his conniving consort, Olga,
queen of the Bessarovian Cossacks.

05:13.898 --> 05:15.274
Egghead?

05:15.441 --> 05:17.401
Olga, queen of the Cossacks?

05:17.944 --> 05:19.779
Rumor has already reached our ear...

05:19.946 --> 05:23.199
...that those two evildoers
have joined forces, and in this town.

05:23.366 --> 05:24.826
That's why we're here.

05:24.992 --> 05:29.497
And it's not surprising that they'd start
in this office and with Commissioner Gordon.

05:29.664 --> 05:31.082
You're not surprised?

05:31.249 --> 05:34.252
What other public personage
could demand more respect...

05:34.418 --> 05:36.587
...or be held for a bigger ransom?

05:36.754 --> 05:40.758
Gosh, yes. Egghead knows
he can ask for the moon and get it.

05:41.259 --> 05:45.263
And if he doesn't get it,
what will happen to Commissioner Gordon?

05:45.596 --> 05:47.431
First things first, Batgirl.

05:47.598 --> 05:49.308
I know how Egghead operates.

05:49.934 --> 05:52.270
He finds the telephone irresistible.

05:52.436 --> 05:56.941
In fact, this one
should be ringing momentarily.

05:57.191 --> 05:58.609
- Hey! Hey!
- Can't you make those...

05:58.776 --> 06:00.444
...wild men of yours quiet down?

06:00.611 --> 06:03.072
- Is victory celebration, Eggski.
-I know.

06:03.239 --> 06:08.035
But I've gotta telephone police headquarters
and tell them about our ransom.

06:08.452 --> 06:11.789
- Is more important ransom than victory dance.
-Yes.

06:13.791 --> 06:15.167
Stop the music.

06:19.839 --> 06:21.632
That must be Egghead's call. May I take it?

06:21.799 --> 06:26.304
- There's no one else in Gotham City who can.
-Commissioner Gordon's office.

06:26.470 --> 06:30.349
Oh, my, my, how your voice
has changed, commissioner.

06:30.683 --> 06:34.645
Never mind the bad jokes.
I know you have Commissioner Gordon.

06:34.812 --> 06:36.230
Oh, do you now, Batman?

06:36.397 --> 06:38.149
And do you also know what we want...

06:38.316 --> 06:41.861
...in eggs-change
for the dear commissioner's life?

06:42.028 --> 06:43.321
What is the ransom?

06:43.487 --> 06:45.323
Just 10 cents, Batman.

06:45.489 --> 06:51.203
One thin dime for every egg eaten
in Gotham City.

06:51.370 --> 06:54.999
<i>- It's sort of an egg-cise tax, Batman.
- Well, that's unfeasible.</i>

06:55.166 --> 06:57.919
Hundreds of thousands of eggs
are consumed in Gotham City.

06:58.085 --> 07:01.297
- There's no way to keep track of them.
-Oh, yes, there is, Batman.

07:01.464 --> 07:03.507
The entire Gotham City police force...

07:03.674 --> 07:07.345
...will be mobilized
as egg counters and tax collectors.

07:07.511 --> 07:10.306
They will make it their business
to count every egg...

07:10.473 --> 07:12.725
...that is consumed within the city limits...

07:12.892 --> 07:16.103
<i>...and to collect my egg tax on each one.</i>

07:16.270 --> 07:19.649
Otherwise, we'll mail
the commissioner back to you in a box.

07:19.815 --> 07:22.401
A pine box.

07:24.195 --> 07:27.865
We have no choice.
The egg tax will be collected.

07:28.032 --> 07:29.408
See that it is, Batman.

07:29.575 --> 07:33.120
And remember,
I'll be making spot checks myself.

07:33.287 --> 07:36.540
If every egg isn't counted and paid for...

07:36.707 --> 07:40.753
...it's goodbye, Gordon. Heh, heh. Clear?

07:41.170 --> 07:42.880
Quite clear.

07:45.758 --> 07:49.929
A 10-cent tax on every egg
eaten in Gotham City.

07:50.096 --> 07:51.430
Holy eggshells.

07:51.597 --> 07:53.891
In a few days, that would add up to millions.

07:54.058 --> 07:57.395
Couldn't we ask the people of Gotham City
to stop eating eggs?

07:57.561 --> 07:58.729
Wait a minute, Robin.

07:58.896 --> 08:01.774
If egg consumption in Gotham City
were to suddenly decline...

08:01.941 --> 08:04.777
...Egghead might take revenge
by harming Commissioner Gordon.

08:04.944 --> 08:07.321
Batgirl is right.
We'll have to pay the egg tax...

08:07.488 --> 08:10.074
...until we locate
and rescue Commissioner Gordon.

08:10.241 --> 08:15.204
And I'm afraid the onerous job
of collecting that tax is yours, Chief O'Hara.

08:15.371 --> 08:17.164
I'll take care of all that, Batman...

08:17.331 --> 08:20.126
...so you can concentrate
on locating those scoundrels.

08:21.335 --> 08:25.256
I have a plan.
It's a long shot, but it just might work.

08:25.423 --> 08:26.966
I, too, have a plan, Batman.

08:27.508 --> 08:31.095
I suggest we attack the problem separately.
With two approaches...

08:31.262 --> 08:35.140
...we have a better chance of locating them.
-I hope you're right, Batgirl.

08:43.441 --> 08:45.484
Hello, chief. The usual?

08:46.068 --> 08:48.821
Right, Gilligan.
A large milk and a hot pastrami.

08:48.988 --> 08:50.990
Never mind the pastrami.

08:51.157 --> 08:54.118
Chief O'Hara would like half a dozen eggs.

08:54.285 --> 08:56.328
- How do you like them, chief?
-Why, you--

08:56.495 --> 08:58.622
Now, one hand on me...

08:58.789 --> 09:02.585
...and you'll never see
your dear commissioner again, chief.

09:02.752 --> 09:04.128
You win, Egghead.

09:04.295 --> 09:06.297
Now, how did you say you liked your eggs?

09:06.464 --> 09:08.049
- Scrambled.
-Hm.

09:08.215 --> 09:11.010
Bring Chief O'Hara half a dozen--

09:11.177 --> 09:14.764
No, make it a dozen scrambled eggs.

09:14.930 --> 09:17.308
Chief, you want me to pounce this guy
out of here?

09:17.475 --> 09:21.187
No, no, Gilligan. He's a friend.

09:21.353 --> 09:24.190
- Just bring the eggs.
-A dozen scrambled eggs?

09:24.356 --> 09:26.692
I'm feeling a bit hungry
this morning, Gilligan.

09:27.026 --> 09:29.320
Anything you say.

09:33.491 --> 09:35.534
I had to pretend to be cool and objective...

09:35.701 --> 09:38.245
...when it was my very own father
who'd been kidnapped.

09:38.412 --> 09:40.873
I understand how difficult
it must have been for you.

09:41.040 --> 09:44.668
- Is there anything I can do?
-Yes, that's why I asked you to come here.

09:45.169 --> 09:47.880
You're the only person in Gotham City
who can help me.

09:48.047 --> 09:50.966
I'll gladly give you any assistance
I can, Ms. Gordon--

09:51.133 --> 09:52.760
Batgirl, I should say.

09:53.344 --> 09:56.263
You have some plan to locate your father?

09:56.722 --> 10:02.353
Well, it's only a remote possibility,
but at least it's better than nothing.

10:02.520 --> 10:05.523
My father uses a very rare brand
of aftershave lotion...

10:05.689 --> 10:07.274
...called Wellington Number Four.

10:07.441 --> 10:08.943
It's imported from Sumatra.

10:09.110 --> 10:10.194
I know the brand.

10:10.361 --> 10:13.781
A former employer of mine,
the Earl of Chutney, used to use it.

10:13.948 --> 10:18.577
If I remember correctly, its ingredients
contain a small amount of curry root...

10:18.744 --> 10:23.332
...which gives it a very pungent aroma,
quite unlike any other aftershave lotion.

10:23.499 --> 10:25.751
Yes, the aroma is unmistakable.

10:26.127 --> 10:28.212
I think I guess your plan.

10:30.589 --> 10:33.551
But shouldn't we enlist the aid of others?

10:33.717 --> 10:35.970
No. Now, think for a moment, Alfred.

10:36.137 --> 10:38.430
How would Batgirl know
such an intimate fact...

10:38.597 --> 10:40.933
...about Commissioner Gordon,
unless, of course...?

10:41.100 --> 10:43.894
I see your point.
But surely Batman and Robin could--

10:44.061 --> 10:46.480
No, no, not them either.

10:46.647 --> 10:50.526
My effectiveness as a crime-fighter
depends on keeping my identity a secret.

10:50.693 --> 10:53.112
And now more than ever,
I need that effectiveness.

10:53.279 --> 10:54.905
You're right.

10:55.114 --> 10:57.992
But I'm afraid it won't be so easy
for just the two of us...

10:58.159 --> 11:00.119
...to traverse the whole of Gotham City...

11:00.286 --> 11:03.747
...trying to locate the aroma
of a particular aftershave lotion.

11:03.914 --> 11:06.250
You're right, Alfred. It's a hopeless task.

11:06.625 --> 11:11.422
So I suggest we begin at once.

11:11.589 --> 11:13.924
Oh, thank you, Alfred.

11:15.885 --> 11:17.761
I would like to be of help, Batman...

11:17.928 --> 11:21.265
...but I have no knowledge of the whereabouts
of Olga and her Cossacks.

11:21.432 --> 11:23.601
She'd hardly communicate
with the embassy...

11:23.767 --> 11:27.771
...since the Cossacks have been at war
with the legitimate government of Bessarovia...

11:27.938 --> 11:28.981
...for many centuries.

11:29.648 --> 11:31.358
I'm aware of that, Mr. Ambassador.

11:31.525 --> 11:34.612
We didn't come here for information,
but for help of another kind.

11:34.945 --> 11:36.614
By all means, Batman.

11:36.780 --> 11:41.452
Believe me, the government of Bessarovia
would like to see this woman apprehended...

11:41.619 --> 11:42.953
...as much as you would.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.330
Good.

11:44.496 --> 11:48.751
It's my suspicion that Olga and her Cossacks
may show up here any time.

11:48.918 --> 11:51.795
Here? But why should they--?

11:51.962 --> 11:53.839
Of course.

11:54.006 --> 11:58.302
- The brass samovar of Genghis Khan.
-Exactly.

11:58.469 --> 12:02.389
The brass samovar of Genghis Khan.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.266
Why is it so important?

12:04.433 --> 12:06.393
It's a symbol of power, Robin.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.729
Like the Stone of Scone to the Scots.

12:08.896 --> 12:13.817
Traditionally, anyone who possesses
the brass samovar of Genghis Khan...

12:13.984 --> 12:16.320
...is the legitimate ruler of Bessarovia.

12:16.487 --> 12:19.698
- What's it doing here, then?
-My government sent it for safekeeping...

12:19.865 --> 12:23.369
...since certain opposition parties
in my country...

12:23.869 --> 12:25.829
...were planning to steal it.

12:26.705 --> 12:30.584
- And you think Olga will try to steal it?
-it may be part of the overall plan.

12:31.168 --> 12:35.047
First the abduction of Commissioner Gordon,
and the egg tax.

12:35.631 --> 12:39.218
Now this samovar.

12:39.385 --> 12:41.011
A priceless target.

12:41.178 --> 12:45.224
The Cossacks have tried to steal the samovar
many times before.

12:45.391 --> 12:51.021
With your help, Mr. Ambassador,
we may make this theft Olga's last.

12:51.188 --> 12:54.400
Just tell me what you want me
to do, Batman.

12:56.235 --> 13:00.030
<i>NARRATOR". As night falls, the Bessarovian
Embassy has other visitors.</i>

13:03.575 --> 13:05.911
There is prize.

13:06.078 --> 13:08.372
Brass samovar of Genghis Khan...

13:08.706 --> 13:11.208
...symbol of Bessarovian power...

13:11.375 --> 13:15.379
...at last is coming to rightful possessor.

13:15.546 --> 13:17.881
Quickly...my Cossacks.

13:18.048 --> 13:19.550
Hey!

13:20.426 --> 13:23.137
Now, now is proof...

13:23.304 --> 13:26.515
...I am imperial queen of Cossacks.

13:26.682 --> 13:32.062
Only queen is entitled
to brass samovar. Push.

13:32.229 --> 13:35.065
Push,push,push.

13:35.232 --> 13:39.403
And be careful you don't scratch
my beautiful samovar...

13:39.570 --> 13:41.905
...or I <i>will</i> slice <i>you to shreds.</i>

13:42.072 --> 13:46.577
Push, push, push, Cossacks.

13:46.744 --> 13:50.914
Push,push.

13:55.002 --> 13:58.630
<i>NARRATOR". The Cossacks and Olga
take the samovar back to their hideout...</i>

13:58.797 --> 14:02.760
<i>...where it joins other collectors' items.</i>

14:18.108 --> 14:19.943
There's the commissioner, Batman.

14:21.862 --> 14:24.782
I think he's trying
to tell us something, Robin.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.291
<i>Welcome, malen'kiy</i> Batushka.

14:42.466 --> 14:46.220
Put the little mal'chik in cage
with old commissioner.

14:46.929 --> 14:50.474
And drag handsome to throne.

14:55.979 --> 14:57.231
What's this?

14:57.398 --> 15:00.025
You've captured the Caped Crusaders?

15:00.192 --> 15:04.446
Olga, you eggs-quisite diabolical genius.

15:04.613 --> 15:06.490
- But of course.
-Yes.

15:06.657 --> 15:07.908
How did you do it?

15:08.075 --> 15:12.162
- By underhand trick, what else?
-Yes.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.998
Aha.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.837
<i>Malen'kiy</i> Batushka is waking.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.882
Handsome.

15:24.258 --> 15:28.262
Oh, no troubles, Batushka...

15:28.429 --> 15:31.765
...or we are making shashlik
out of little mal'chik...

15:31.932 --> 15:33.642
...and old commissioner.

15:37.062 --> 15:41.191
Yes, much better, Batushka.

15:41.859 --> 15:47.781
You would like to know perhaps
how you are being tricked, huh?

15:49.533 --> 15:50.701
Orloff.

15:53.871 --> 15:55.080
Your Highness.

15:55.247 --> 15:58.125
So you gave us away
as a traitor to your country.

15:58.292 --> 15:59.460
Who is traitor?

15:59.626 --> 16:03.046
I am Bessarovian Cossack from little boy.

16:03.338 --> 16:05.048
ls true.

16:05.215 --> 16:08.427
Omar is famous magnificent
Bessarovian chef.

16:08.594 --> 16:10.554
Thank you, Highness.

16:12.389 --> 16:16.894
And now I am making greatest
Bessarovian borscht of my career.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.482
With special ingredients.

16:24.568 --> 16:26.737
No, I object.

16:26.904 --> 16:29.531
Well, you think cooking in borscht
is too cruel, Eggski?

16:29.698 --> 16:31.533
No, don't be ridiculous, Olga.

16:31.700 --> 16:35.454
It's just that I'd like to kill them now.
They're too tricky to play around with.

16:35.621 --> 16:36.747
Believe me, I know them.

16:36.914 --> 16:40.626
Now that we've got them,
let's eggs-terminate them.

16:40.792 --> 16:43.795
Who is "we"? I caught them.

16:44.087 --> 16:49.426
Besides, I may decide not
to cook malen'kiy Batushka.

16:49.718 --> 16:54.765
Don't tell me that you're falling
for this cowled clown?

16:54.932 --> 16:56.225
Maybe.

16:56.391 --> 16:57.893
Maybe not.

16:58.060 --> 17:00.896
- We are seeing.
-But you are engaged to me.

17:01.063 --> 17:02.814
How dare you two-time me?

17:02.981 --> 17:04.983
And especially with this caped creep.

17:05.150 --> 17:07.109
How dare you tell me what to do?

17:07.277 --> 17:09.946
Me, Olga, queen of Bessarovian Cossacks.

17:10.113 --> 17:12.950
Olga Shmolga.
You'd still be washing dishes...

17:13.116 --> 17:16.619
...in that run-down Bessarovian restaurant
if it wasn't for me.

17:18.247 --> 17:19.414
Be careful.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.165
Old Cossack proverb:

17:21.333 --> 17:24.962
"Open mouth
is leading quickly to open grave."

17:25.127 --> 17:28.632
And don't give me
any of your Cossack proverbs either.

17:28.799 --> 17:30.634
I say kill him now or I'll--

17:37.349 --> 17:39.851
So much for big-mouth.

17:41.019 --> 17:47.651
Now we can have malen'kiy talk,
eh, Batushka?

17:48.819 --> 17:53.740
You find me attractive little, huh?

17:53.907 --> 17:58.745
I'd find you much more attractive
if you were on the right side of the law, Olga.

17:58.912 --> 18:02.583
- This kind of life can only lead to trouble.
-Heh, heh.

18:02.749 --> 18:06.670
Is better making love
than sermons, Batushka.

18:06.837 --> 18:11.592
Otherwise you are going into pot
with others.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.678
A little kiss maybe?

18:14.845 --> 18:17.514
A little kiss not maybe.

18:20.183 --> 18:23.353
Maybe I give you little kiss. Hm?

18:30.193 --> 18:33.071
The great Bessarovian borscht of my career.

18:33.238 --> 18:35.032
Beautiful, beautiful.

18:36.033 --> 18:37.659
Step right in there.

18:37.826 --> 18:40.871
This will be beautiful, beautiful. Ha, ha.

18:41.038 --> 18:43.373
Oh, very nice.

18:55.135 --> 18:58.221
Well, you are no longer in Bessarovia, Olga.

18:58.388 --> 19:00.557
In this country, the standards are different.

19:00.724 --> 19:03.769
You should abide by our customs,
not yours.

19:03.935 --> 19:06.063
On contrary...

19:06.229 --> 19:11.026
...I am considering this place
<i>malen'kiy</i> piece of Bessarovia.

19:11.193 --> 19:14.196
Here, we are following my customs.

19:14.363 --> 19:17.574
And my customs
are requiring wedding borscht...

19:17.741 --> 19:21.119
...made from captured prisoners.

19:21.328 --> 19:25.666
- Wedding borscht?
-Of course, Batushka.

19:25.957 --> 19:28.543
But I thought you were engaged
to marry Egghead.

19:28.710 --> 19:31.213
I am marrying both of you.

19:31.380 --> 19:35.550
Cossack queen is permitted
up to six husbands.

19:35.717 --> 19:38.929
Oh, but do not worry, Batushka.

19:39.096 --> 19:44.059
You will always be number one in my heart.

20:09.459 --> 20:10.919
Batgirl, this is Alfred.

20:11.086 --> 20:12.295
<i>I have just detected...</i>

20:12.546 --> 20:15.841
...the unmistakable aroma
of Wellington Number Four.

20:16.007 --> 20:18.135
<i>Where are you, Alfred?</i>

20:18.802 --> 20:21.972
In front of a warehouse
at number 12 Bannister Street.

20:22.139 --> 20:24.474
<i>- I'll be right there.
-Good.</i>

20:43.744 --> 20:45.328
It's unmistakable, Alfred.

20:45.495 --> 20:48.999
Wellington Number Four
coming from inside this warehouse.

20:49.166 --> 20:50.959
Oh, you can't go in alone, Batgirl.

20:51.126 --> 20:54.045
If nothing else, I'll go in with you
and provide a diversion.

20:54.212 --> 20:57.299
No, Alfred, I would never forgive myself
if you got hurt.

20:57.466 --> 20:59.843
Now, you must stay here.

21:07.017 --> 21:10.979
Soon you are both becoming my husbands.

21:11.146 --> 21:16.568
Well, it's worth playing second fiddle
just to see Batman married.

21:19.696 --> 21:21.740
'Batgirl!
'Batgirl?

21:21.907 --> 21:23.283
Batgirl.

21:45.305 --> 21:48.016
They need help. They can't handle
all those Cossacks alone.

21:48.183 --> 21:50.060
You are both staying right here in pot.

21:50.227 --> 21:51.728
- Here.
-What?

21:52.729 --> 21:56.107
Alfred, Bruce Wayne's butler.
What are you--?

21:56.274 --> 21:58.735
No time to explain now, commissioner.

21:58.902 --> 22:00.403
- There we go.
-Thank you, Alfred.

22:00.570 --> 22:02.739
I'm with you, Batman.

22:03.114 --> 22:06.159
Oh, help me, Eggski.
You must do something.

22:06.326 --> 22:09.204
My Cossacks are falling like vodka bottles.

22:09.371 --> 22:11.748
So you admit you need my help, eh, Olga?

22:13.750 --> 22:16.253
- Bygones be bygones.
-All right, come over here.

22:16.419 --> 22:23.260
I've been saving this little surprise
for just such an eggs-igency. Heh, heh.

22:25.345 --> 22:29.432
Yes, these hens have been fed
a straight diet of onions...

22:29.599 --> 22:31.101
...for the past six months.

22:31.268 --> 22:33.603
Onions? What is from these onions?

22:33.770 --> 22:36.439
You just wait a minute, my dear,
and you'll see.

22:53.081 --> 22:54.624
Out of my way.

23:05.802 --> 23:09.389
All right, Egghead, your turn has come to--

23:10.473 --> 23:13.727
Unh! What--'? I--

23:19.065 --> 23:21.860
Have a good cry, Batman. You'll need it.

23:28.033 --> 23:29.075
Oh!

23:32.412 --> 23:33.830
Oh! Yes.

23:34.664 --> 23:38.084
You'll discover that
kidnapping police commissioners is--

23:51.640 --> 23:54.184
- Are you all right, Batman?
-Yes, commissioner.

23:54.351 --> 23:56.686
But I'm afraid they've escaped.

23:56.853 --> 24:01.900
And Egghead used
a particularly powerful form of tear gas.

24:02.067 --> 24:03.652
Holy crying towels, Batman.

24:03.818 --> 24:06.488
- This stuff is terrible.
-I know.

24:06.655 --> 24:09.199
At least you're safe, Commissioner Gordon.

24:09.366 --> 24:11.993
Yes, Batgirl, but is Gotham City safe?

24:17.207 --> 24:22.545
I'm afraid Gotham City won't be safe
until those Cossacks are behind bars.

24:23.546 --> 24:24.881
<i>NARRATOR".
How right he is.</i>

24:25.048 --> 24:29.636
<i>Gotham City faces disaster with Egghead,
Olga and the Cossacks on the loose.</i>

24:29.803 --> 24:31.763
<i>When and how will it end?</i>

24:31.930 --> 24:33.181
<i>Will it end?</i>

24:33.348 --> 24:37.227
<i>Maybe we'll get an inkling
in our next episode.</i>
