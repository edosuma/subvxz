00:08.947 --> 00:10.368
Zoey, just don't take this
the wrong way,

00:10.393 --> 00:12.657
but can you just... fall back?

00:15.911 --> 00:17.628
You speak from the heart,
and he'll understand.

<i>Dreams come in many forms.</i>

01:26.048 --> 01:27.917

01:27.950 --> 01:30.853
<i>that may haunt your thoughts

01:30.887 --> 01:33.456
<i>I prefer them in less disturbing forms.</i>

01:34.356 --> 01:37.361
<i>Like a beautiful night...</i>

01:37.394 --> 01:39.663
<i>or an impeccable couple...</i>

01:39.695 --> 01:42.164
<i>or watching your friend

01:42.197 --> 01:44.433
<i>of making a difference.</i>

01:44.466 --> 01:46.203
Passed hors d'oeuvres,

01:46.236 --> 01:48.538
alcohol <i> not</i> in red Solo cups,

01:48.570 --> 01:50.039
and no trap music?

01:50.072 --> 01:53.376
Aaron really pulled
something special together.

01:53.409 --> 01:54.810
Yeah, when he said he wanted to do

01:54.843 --> 01:56.113
an event for Black mental health,

01:56.146 --> 01:57.614
I kinda assumed he was just gonna

01:57.647 --> 02:00.216
throw together a gospel brunch
or a Spades tournament.

02:00.250 --> 02:01.385
Yeah.

02:01.418 --> 02:04.120
Oh, my God. Damn, look at Nomi and Ana!

02:04.154 --> 02:05.188
- Ladies, photo?
- Oh, no, no, no.

02:05.220 --> 02:06.989
I'm not here to do all of that.

02:07.023 --> 02:10.060
I'm just here for the cause,
not to support Aaron.

02:10.092 --> 02:12.328
It's bad enough I even caved and came.

02:12.362 --> 02:13.964
Ana, you're not caving, okay?

02:13.997 --> 02:15.065
You're taking the higher road.

02:15.097 --> 02:16.333
And you're not even gonna see
him anyway,

02:16.366 --> 02:17.534
'cause I promise
I'm gonna keep you guys separate

02:17.566 --> 02:18.834
the entire night.

02:18.868 --> 02:20.203
- Okay. Yeah.
- All right?

02:20.236 --> 02:21.738
Just relax and celebrate the fact

02:21.771 --> 02:23.305
that a few weeks of no alcohol's
giving your ass

02:23.339 --> 02:25.242
very strong JLo
"Waiting for Tonight" vibes.

02:25.274 --> 02:26.308
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

02:26.341 --> 02:28.378
Oh, wait. Hold on. Wrong way.

02:28.410 --> 02:29.845
Okay.

02:29.879 --> 02:31.081
Just... Let's go.

02:32.614 --> 02:34.583
- Let's go.
- Oh. Thank you.

02:34.617 --> 02:36.319
Sky, you can slow down.

02:36.351 --> 02:37.853
You don't have to be a hero.

02:37.886 --> 02:39.522
Yeah, this flimsy red carpet

02:39.555 --> 02:41.190
might slip under you like a bath mat.

02:41.224 --> 02:43.593
Remember, that's
how Grandma Sadie went down.

02:43.625 --> 02:45.428
No. The crack-infested '80s

02:45.462 --> 02:47.363
brought Grandma Sadie down, okay?

02:47.397 --> 02:48.832
Guys, I'm fine.

02:48.864 --> 02:51.034
Seriously, it's just a sprain.

02:51.066 --> 02:52.402
Um, excuse me, sir.

02:52.434 --> 02:55.204
Can you please hold these while
I make all my exes jealous?

02:55.237 --> 02:57.239
Okay, you are not putting
any weight on that knee.

02:57.273 --> 02:58.375
You take these crutches from her

02:58.408 --> 03:00.110
and they're going up your ass.

03:00.142 --> 03:01.410
What do I say to that?

03:01.444 --> 03:02.779
You take these crutches

03:02.811 --> 03:04.081
and tell us to say "cheese," bitch.

03:04.113 --> 03:05.214
O-Okay, okay.

03:05.248 --> 03:06.715
Just take the picture, bro.

03:06.749 --> 03:09.119
Oh.

03:13.322 --> 03:15.224
All right, smile like this is
the last photo

03:15.257 --> 03:17.927
you will ever take as
Joey Bada$$'s biggest fan.

03:17.960 --> 03:19.362
Because after he meets you tonight?

03:19.394 --> 03:21.197
B-F-Fs.

03:21.231 --> 03:23.233
Again, Zoey, I'm... I'm not a fan.

03:23.266 --> 03:26.069
I just have mad respect and
an intense devotion to his art.

03:26.101 --> 03:28.304
I mean, have you seen the shit
he does with Pro Era?

03:28.338 --> 03:30.207
It's inspiring.

03:30.239 --> 03:31.774
And his lyrics? They speak to me.

03:31.808 --> 03:34.111
It's like we live the same lifestyle...

03:34.143 --> 03:36.112
aggressive but also sensitive.

03:36.146 --> 03:39.148
Got it. Like an adoring fan.

03:59.368 --> 04:01.670
They say you never get a second chance

04:01.703 --> 04:03.906
to make a good first impression.

04:03.940 --> 04:07.244
And this is it... Luca's first
big moment with his idol.

04:11.980 --> 04:13.783
S'up, bro.

04:13.816 --> 04:16.452
S'up.

04:16.485 --> 04:18.187
Hey, baby.

04:18.220 --> 04:19.689
He's really eyeing that piece.

04:19.721 --> 04:21.825
You should let him know that
that's your friend's art

04:21.857 --> 04:23.526
and just keep the conversation
going from there.

04:23.559 --> 04:25.261
Remember, you got to tell him

04:25.295 --> 04:29.299
you are aggressive
but also so sensitive.

04:29.331 --> 04:32.334
- Huh?
- Zoey, I'm cool. I got this.

04:39.309 --> 04:41.645
Hey! Hey, hi. I'm Zoey.

04:41.677 --> 04:44.547
Um, hate to brag, but my <i> boyfriend</i>

04:44.581 --> 04:47.049
is responsible for the art here.

04:47.083 --> 04:49.553
Uh, guilty, caught me.
I'm bragging. I'm bragging.

04:49.585 --> 04:51.388
Oh, you did this?

04:51.420 --> 04:54.057
- No.
- Wh...

04:54.090 --> 04:57.194
No, he didn't <i> do it,</i> do it, per se.

04:57.227 --> 05:00.797
But he's responsible for it being here.

05:00.830 --> 05:03.200
Like... drove it here?

05:03.232 --> 05:04.533
No, um...

05:04.566 --> 05:06.335
his homegirl is the artist,

05:06.369 --> 05:08.470
and so Luca here
connected Aaron with her.

05:08.504 --> 05:11.975
And then, boom, art! A common interest.

05:12.008 --> 05:13.643
Cool, cool.

05:13.675 --> 05:15.411
Cool.

05:15.444 --> 05:16.412
- You ready?
- Let's go.

05:16.446 --> 05:18.081
You know some synonyms for "cool"

05:18.114 --> 05:20.150
are "phenomenal" and "amazing".

05:20.182 --> 05:21.850
Well, that went well.

05:21.884 --> 05:23.485
Zoey, just don't take this
the wrong way,

05:23.518 --> 05:25.487
but can you just... fall back?

05:25.521 --> 05:27.691
"Fall back"?

05:27.723 --> 05:29.725
How do you take that the <i> right</i> way?

05:29.759 --> 05:31.660
I mean, I know you like to come in hot

05:31.694 --> 05:32.896
and lay on the charm

05:32.929 --> 05:35.265
and become best friends
in the first 10 minutes.

05:35.297 --> 05:37.266
- You know, it's...
- You're describing a Golden Retriever.

05:37.299 --> 05:40.002
All I'm saying is that that's not me.

05:40.035 --> 05:41.403
You know, I just like to lay in the cut

05:41.436 --> 05:43.872
and just let things happen naturally.

05:43.905 --> 05:45.341
Just ride my own wave.

05:45.374 --> 05:46.610
Cool.

05:46.643 --> 05:50.013
Um... well, while you are here
"riding your own wave,"

05:50.045 --> 05:52.182
I'll be over there...

05:52.215 --> 05:55.385
riding one of those drinks and
possibly a vegan mini slider.

05:55.417 --> 05:57.386
- Ooh, those are fire.
- Mm-hmm.

05:57.420 --> 05:58.722
Can you grab me one or two?

05:58.754 --> 06:00.389
- Got ya. All right, bye.
- All right.

06:03.326 --> 06:08.030
Wow, when you're sober,
people are unattractive.

06:08.064 --> 06:10.100
All right, Black Eagle spotted.
We're on the move.

06:10.133 --> 06:11.701
Wait.

06:11.734 --> 06:13.136
False alarm.

06:13.169 --> 06:16.373
You know, spotting Aaron in a
sea of Black men in black tie...

06:16.405 --> 06:18.374
it's a lot harder than I expected.

06:18.408 --> 06:19.809
- Nomi.
- Mm.

06:19.842 --> 06:21.745
No. I was right, not racist.

06:21.778 --> 06:23.247
It's Black Eagle. Go, go, go!

06:25.148 --> 06:27.249
Hey, man. Hey. Where'd she go?

06:27.283 --> 06:29.386
- Hey. Look, um...
- Yes, sir?

06:29.419 --> 06:31.254
...do you recommend anything for nerves?

06:31.287 --> 06:33.657
I have a big speech coming up, and
I-I don't want anything too strong,

06:33.689 --> 06:35.424
'cause I don't want to be like how
I was at my cousin's wedding.

06:35.458 --> 06:37.660
I started talking about my aunt's boobs.

06:37.694 --> 06:39.662
Not her boobs exactly,

06:39.696 --> 06:41.998
but her breast reduction she got when...
'cause she had back pain and...

06:42.030 --> 06:44.233
Anyway, screw it.
Can I just get a drink?

06:44.266 --> 06:47.170
<i>So, Luca had basically told me</i>

06:47.203 --> 06:49.005
<i>I was cramping his style.</i>

06:49.037 --> 06:52.141
<i>And since I couldn't find
the vegan sliders or my girls,</i>

06:52.174 --> 06:54.610
<i>I did what any person
in my position would do...</i>

06:54.643 --> 06:56.179
<i>I just stared at my phone</i>

06:56.211 --> 06:59.648
<i>as if I was receiving some
extremely important texts.</i>

07:01.951 --> 07:03.085
You good?

07:03.119 --> 07:04.487
Me? Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

07:04.520 --> 07:05.789
I'm good. I'm good.

07:08.057 --> 07:10.492
- But you know who's great?
- Who?

07:10.525 --> 07:11.427
My boyfriend.

07:11.460 --> 07:13.095
I had never seen him more excited

07:13.129 --> 07:15.831
than when he realized Aaron
had booked you for this event.

07:15.864 --> 07:18.802
97 unsolicited DMs later, here I am.

07:18.835 --> 07:20.503
Luckily for your boy, though,

07:20.535 --> 07:22.605
this is a cause that I really
get down on.

07:22.638 --> 07:24.340
Oh, yeah, no, cool. Same. Totally same.

07:24.374 --> 07:26.275
But you know who you should also
get down with?

07:26.309 --> 07:27.677
Let me guess... your boyfriend.

07:27.710 --> 07:29.779
Have you heard of him?

07:29.811 --> 07:32.514
I mean, he actually is a really...

07:32.547 --> 07:34.550
super talented designer

07:34.583 --> 07:37.019
who would absolutely kill me
if he knew I was saying this,

07:37.052 --> 07:41.391
but it's kind of his dream job
to work with you.

07:41.424 --> 07:44.227
I'm sure you hear that
all the time, though.

07:44.259 --> 07:46.495
Yeah, as long as you don't link me
to your SoundCloud, we're good.

07:47.597 --> 07:48.665
Dope bracelet, by the way.

07:48.698 --> 07:50.299
- Jon Buscemi.
- Mm-hmm.

07:50.333 --> 07:52.402
- That's my boy.
- Oh, that's amazing.

07:52.434 --> 07:53.535
I have the sneakers to match.

07:53.569 --> 07:55.571
But not that I'd ever wear them
at the same time.

07:55.605 --> 07:57.307
'Cause, I mean, I'm a stylist.
I know better.

07:57.340 --> 07:58.508
Oh, so you style?

08:04.347 --> 08:06.750
So, yeah, Jazz and Sky
were the first customers

08:06.783 --> 08:09.085
of the Zoey Johnson Styling Experience,

08:09.117 --> 08:12.321
and, fun fact, I almost
got fired over this picture.

08:12.355 --> 08:14.090
That there is dope.

08:14.122 --> 08:15.824
I can tell you really got an eye.

08:15.857 --> 08:17.093
Well, thanks.

08:17.126 --> 08:20.063
Yeah, well, my brand is doing
a pop-up in a few days.

08:20.095 --> 08:22.165
You should come through.
Maybe add a little bit

08:22.198 --> 08:24.768
of that "Zoey Johnson
Styling Experience."

08:24.800 --> 08:26.835
Uh, like a job?

08:26.869 --> 08:28.605
Yeah, a job.

08:28.638 --> 08:31.673
I'll have my assistant find you
and get you the info.

08:31.706 --> 08:33.241
- Okay?
- Yeah.

08:33.275 --> 08:34.443
Take care.

08:36.446 --> 08:38.280
Uh, wait.

08:38.313 --> 08:39.682
I-I can't.

08:39.715 --> 08:40.716
What?

08:40.749 --> 08:42.384
I can't work for you.

08:42.417 --> 08:44.520
I mean, I'd... I'd absolutely love to,

08:44.553 --> 08:46.922
but I can't.

08:46.956 --> 08:49.426
So thank... you.

08:49.459 --> 08:51.261
All good. Be easy.

08:55.263 --> 08:58.502
Did I just turn down a dream job?

09:02.738 --> 09:05.208
<i>In the same way a dream can wander</i>

09:05.240 --> 09:06.609
<i>from sitting on a sunny beach</i>

09:06.642 --> 09:09.379
<i>to running naked through
your middle-school lunchroom,</i>

09:09.412 --> 09:12.282
<i>tonight had taken the same strange path.</i>

09:12.315 --> 09:14.217
<i>And I needed some help</i>

09:14.249 --> 09:16.686
<i>interpreting this latest turn of events.</i>

09:18.921 --> 09:20.623
So, what happened?

09:20.656 --> 09:22.492
Uh, it's a long story,
but the short of it is,

09:22.524 --> 09:24.960
Joey Bada$$ offered me a job
at his pop-up shop.

09:28.196 --> 09:30.566
Why would you turn that down?

09:30.600 --> 09:33.403
Because it's Luca's dream
to work side-by-side with him,

09:33.436 --> 09:36.004
and I-I can't steal something
like that from my boyfriend.

09:38.441 --> 09:39.676
Steal?

09:39.709 --> 09:41.945
Did he offer the job to Luca first?

09:41.978 --> 09:42.946
No.

09:42.979 --> 09:44.446
Well, was he going to?

09:44.480 --> 09:45.614
I don't know.

09:47.816 --> 09:49.485
Guys, please tell me
I did the right thing,

09:49.518 --> 09:50.787
because I did, right?

09:52.555 --> 09:53.989
- Totally.
- Yes.

09:55.224 --> 09:57.460
Oh, my God, I totally
screwed up, didn't I?

09:57.493 --> 09:58.695
- Yes.
- Totally.

10:06.067 --> 10:07.870
I'll be back. Bathroom.

10:07.903 --> 10:09.605
We're going, too.

10:09.638 --> 10:11.541
You're gonna have to cover
your eyes, baby.

10:11.574 --> 10:13.610
Would you please come out
from under my nuts?

10:13.643 --> 10:15.378
Seriously, my knee's not broken,

10:15.411 --> 10:16.513
I'm not dying,

10:16.546 --> 10:18.448
and I don't need you and your boyfriend

10:18.480 --> 10:19.782
coming to the bathroom with me.

10:19.815 --> 10:23.653
Yeah, for the record,
that's not for me, either.

10:23.686 --> 10:25.555
The doctor said
you have to stay off of it.

10:25.587 --> 10:27.456
Finals are coming up
in just a few weeks.

10:27.489 --> 10:28.624
Yeah, Jazz, I know.

10:28.658 --> 10:30.292
What do you think
I think about every day

10:30.326 --> 10:32.461
in our dorm room, alone?

10:32.494 --> 10:33.962
Seriously, I just wanted one night

10:33.995 --> 10:35.664
to take my mind off of things.

10:35.697 --> 10:37.799
- Yeah, but I need to make sure that...
- Please!

10:37.832 --> 10:39.903
Just for like one hour,

10:39.936 --> 10:43.038
can you <i> try</i> to treat me
like a normal human being?

10:44.039 --> 10:45.674
Yeah.

10:45.707 --> 10:48.377
I love you. I'm sorry.

10:48.411 --> 10:49.579
I love you, too.

10:49.611 --> 10:51.046
But, for real, I gotta pee.

10:54.115 --> 10:55.619
By herself.

10:57.720 --> 10:59.755
<i>I couldn't stop replaying the moment</i>

10:59.788 --> 11:02.591
<i>over and over again in my head.</i>

11:02.624 --> 11:04.226
<i>And even though I worried</i>

11:04.259 --> 11:06.562
<i>I made the wrong decision for my career,</i>

11:06.595 --> 11:10.265
<i>I believed I had made the right
decision for my relationship.</i>

11:10.298 --> 11:11.733
Miss.

11:11.767 --> 11:14.671
Is that one of those vegan sliders?

11:14.704 --> 11:16.406
I have been looking for this all night.

11:16.438 --> 11:18.206
Yeah, this is actually the last one.

11:18.239 --> 11:20.076
Oh, my God. Thank you.

11:22.244 --> 11:23.546
Damn it.

11:23.579 --> 11:25.013
This is Luca's favorite.

11:25.047 --> 11:26.883
I really should let him have it.

11:29.652 --> 11:31.186
You know what? Hold up.

11:31.220 --> 11:33.590
Is that what <i> he</i> would even
want me to do?

11:33.623 --> 11:36.725
Hey, babe, this vegan slider

11:36.759 --> 11:39.696
is your absolute favorite
thing, isn't it?

11:39.729 --> 11:41.445
I mean, yeah.
I also really like bike rides...

11:41.469 --> 11:43.211
Okay, not pertinent.
We're talking about this slider,

11:43.235 --> 11:45.634
and it's the last one.
So would you be mad if <i> I</i> ate it?

11:45.667 --> 11:46.779
I don't know. Are you hungry?

11:46.804 --> 11:48.104
Very, but I know
that you really love it.

11:48.137 --> 11:49.706
And even though I really,
really like it, too,

11:49.739 --> 11:51.541
I know that you really, really
love it, so it would be unfair

11:51.574 --> 11:53.276
- if I took it, yeah?
- Can't we just split it?

11:53.308 --> 11:54.643
No. No, we cannot split it.

11:54.677 --> 11:56.079
You can't split this with me.

11:56.111 --> 11:57.746
You either take it or you don't.

11:57.779 --> 11:59.081
Bro...

11:59.114 --> 12:01.618
this is the realest conversation
we've ever had.

12:01.651 --> 12:02.952
It is.

12:02.985 --> 12:05.621
So now, the question remains,

12:05.654 --> 12:07.823
would you be mad if <i> I</i> ate the slider

12:07.856 --> 12:11.093
if that means
that you don't get to have one?

12:11.127 --> 12:13.162
I mean, there are more vegan
sliders out there.

12:13.195 --> 12:14.831
It's not the last one in the world.

12:14.864 --> 12:16.633
You're the one that got it, so have it.

12:16.666 --> 12:18.301
I'll be fine.

12:18.334 --> 12:20.737
Oh, my God.

12:20.769 --> 12:23.672
Luca is so right.
This is just one slider.

12:23.706 --> 12:25.841
There are plenty
of other sliders out there

12:25.874 --> 12:27.777
for him to have.

12:27.810 --> 12:29.512
And, okay, B.T.Dubs...

12:29.544 --> 12:33.181
sliders are really cool job
opportunities in this scenario.

12:33.215 --> 12:35.518
Enjoy your slider, babe.

12:35.551 --> 12:37.586
- I'm...
- Yeah.

12:44.060 --> 12:45.695
Wow, hey.

12:45.728 --> 12:48.498
Hey.

12:48.531 --> 12:50.166
You enjoying the party?

12:51.634 --> 12:52.869
Mm-hmm.

12:52.902 --> 12:55.838
Uh... listen, I know you didn't have to,

12:55.870 --> 12:58.106
but I-I really do appreciate
you coming through.

12:58.139 --> 12:59.708
Yeah, well, um...

12:59.741 --> 13:01.343
Oh, it's, uh... it's a good cause.

13:01.377 --> 13:02.712
Yeah, it is. I just hope I don't blow

13:02.744 --> 13:04.047
what seems to be a great evening

13:04.080 --> 13:07.316
by embarrassing myself
with, uh, this speech.

13:07.349 --> 13:09.719
It's kinda what I tend to do
at these things.

13:09.752 --> 13:11.186
Well, um...

13:11.220 --> 13:12.888
good luck.

13:12.922 --> 13:16.058
Gonna need it.

13:18.728 --> 13:20.863
Look, um...

13:20.895 --> 13:22.864
you want some advice?

13:22.898 --> 13:24.399
Yes. I-I honestly...

13:24.432 --> 13:26.635
I just can't afford to take
another "L" at one of my events.

13:26.668 --> 13:30.072
You started this year
wanting to elevate Hawkins.

13:30.105 --> 13:31.340
Yeah.

13:31.373 --> 13:33.009
Look at this event.

13:33.042 --> 13:34.243
You did just that,

13:34.276 --> 13:37.580
so you don't need to figure out
what to say.

13:37.613 --> 13:40.316
So just speak from the heart.

13:40.349 --> 13:42.719
Everyone will love it because
they'll know it's genuine.

13:45.454 --> 13:47.056
Thank you.

13:47.089 --> 13:49.525
I'm... I'm glad I could help.

13:49.557 --> 13:50.759
Me, too.

14:13.467 --> 14:15.004
Hi. Sorry.

14:15.029 --> 14:17.018
Styling Experience. What's up?

14:17.052 --> 14:20.012
Um, okay, this is gonna seem
a little random,

14:20.037 --> 14:21.949
but if it's not too late,

14:21.990 --> 14:24.960
I would like to take you up
on your job offer.

14:24.994 --> 14:26.428
Why the sudden change of heart?

14:26.461 --> 14:27.763
Well...

14:27.797 --> 14:29.364
Okay, just to be completely honest,

14:29.398 --> 14:31.768
uh, I kind of panicked in the moment.

14:31.801 --> 14:33.369
I was a little worried
that if I took it,

14:33.402 --> 14:36.906
I'd be stealing
my boyfriend's dream job.

14:36.938 --> 14:39.274
Honestly, the job
was never your boy's to have.

14:39.307 --> 14:40.809
I mean, you know, he was cool,

14:40.842 --> 14:42.544
but he just seemed a little too cool.

14:42.577 --> 14:46.114
Unlike you, who just kinda
puts it all out there,

14:46.148 --> 14:47.749
not caring how it makes you look.

14:47.783 --> 14:50.119
Yep. That's me.

14:50.152 --> 14:53.288
So... the job's still mine?

14:53.321 --> 14:54.956
- Sure, if you still want it.
- Yes!

14:54.989 --> 14:56.124
I do, I do.

14:56.158 --> 14:58.226
Bet. It's yours.

14:58.259 --> 15:02.230
Well, technically, I did give
Luca the last vegan slider,

15:02.263 --> 15:04.767
so he should be fine with this.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.435
Right?

15:06.467 --> 15:08.837
At the beginning of the school year,

15:08.870 --> 15:10.807
uh, my goal was to elevate Hawkins.

15:10.840 --> 15:12.809
And, to be honest, I failed.

15:12.841 --> 15:15.443
So when the issue of mental
health in our community

15:15.476 --> 15:16.946
literally came to my doorstep,

15:16.979 --> 15:19.482
I was face-to-face
with the lack of resources,

15:19.514 --> 15:21.316
the, uh... the lack of awareness,

15:21.350 --> 15:23.518
and it all just kinda felt
too big to tackle.

15:23.552 --> 15:26.188
But seeing you all show up here tonight,

15:26.221 --> 15:29.124
looking like the true definition
of Black Excellence,

15:29.158 --> 15:31.326
I don't feel that way anymore.

15:31.360 --> 15:34.095
Tonight, I-I look out
onto a room full of people,

15:34.129 --> 15:36.932
and I can honestly say
I'm moved by your support.

15:38.967 --> 15:41.770
And, um... yeah,
speaking from the heart,

15:41.803 --> 15:45.106
I can say that I've never been
more surrounded by true friends,

15:45.139 --> 15:46.942
so thank you.

15:46.975 --> 15:50.013
All right.

15:51.980 --> 15:53.883
Okay, enough with the sap.

15:53.916 --> 15:55.117
We're gonna drink. We're gonna eat.

15:55.149 --> 15:56.952
Joey Bada$$ is here.
Make some noise for him.

15:58.254 --> 16:00.489
Uh, and our lovely young deejay's...

16:00.522 --> 16:02.023
Hey, Sky.

16:02.057 --> 16:03.392
Junior!

16:03.425 --> 16:04.894
What are you doing here?

16:04.927 --> 16:06.995
I heard you were having a rough night.

16:08.196 --> 16:10.566
There's no way you can enjoy
yourself on those ugly things,

16:10.599 --> 16:13.703
so I brought you these.

16:13.735 --> 16:15.871
Oh... my God.

16:15.904 --> 16:18.473
You are so sweet. Wow.

16:18.507 --> 16:19.909
They're my Grandma Ruby's.

16:19.941 --> 16:21.677
She uses them at the Beverly Connection

16:21.710 --> 16:23.879
to stage slip and fall "accidents".

16:23.912 --> 16:26.047
Okay.

16:26.081 --> 16:27.515
Well, they're very beautiful.

16:27.548 --> 16:29.852
But what you <i> won't</i> need these for...

16:31.720 --> 16:33.989
...is a slow dance.

16:34.023 --> 16:36.057
May I?

16:36.090 --> 16:37.726
All right.

16:37.759 --> 16:39.261
We'll see if I can do this.

16:39.294 --> 16:41.563
Oh, don't worry. I'll hold you up.

16:41.596 --> 16:44.833
I've been taking this new
Hoopnotica Hula-Hoop course,

16:44.866 --> 16:47.002
so my core is incredibly strong.

16:47.036 --> 16:48.838
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

16:53.274 --> 16:55.177
You did this?

16:55.210 --> 16:57.546
If there's one thing I know about you,

16:57.579 --> 17:00.249
Jazzlyn Amerie Forster,

17:00.282 --> 17:02.417
it's that if your sister's scared,

17:02.450 --> 17:04.886
you're scared.

17:04.919 --> 17:06.821
And I love you too much
to see you scared.

17:09.425 --> 17:11.661
You love me too much?

17:13.329 --> 17:15.262
I love you.

17:15.296 --> 17:19.134
I love you, too,
Douglas Fredrick Edwards.

17:25.138 --> 17:27.409
I'm gonna go outside and call us a car.

17:27.443 --> 17:28.577
All right.

17:31.080 --> 17:34.082
- Doing, Freshman?
- Oh, hey.

17:34.116 --> 17:36.319
I wanted to say thank you, 'cause
if we hadn't had that conversation

17:36.351 --> 17:38.119
about pushing walls, then none of this

17:38.152 --> 17:39.587
would've happened tonight, so...

17:39.620 --> 17:42.958
Well, tonight was <i> spectacular.</i> Truly.

17:42.992 --> 17:45.261
Joey Bada$$ kinda offered
me a job at his pop-up shop.

17:45.293 --> 17:46.995
- That's amazing!
- Yeah!

17:47.029 --> 17:48.097
- You s... You serious?
- Uh-huh.

17:48.129 --> 17:49.264
Wow!

17:49.298 --> 17:50.800
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

17:50.832 --> 17:52.467
How's, uh, fanboy taking it?

17:52.501 --> 17:55.071
- Well, I haven't exactly told him yet.
- Right.

17:55.103 --> 17:57.739
Uh... so...

17:57.773 --> 17:59.140
Think he's gonna hate me?

17:59.174 --> 18:00.843
Nah, how can he hate you?

18:00.876 --> 18:02.845
He's your dude. What?

18:02.878 --> 18:04.245
He's gonna be happy for you, okay?

18:04.279 --> 18:05.848
Every guy wants to see his girl win.

18:05.880 --> 18:08.016
Yeah, well, Luca's a little off-center.

18:08.050 --> 18:09.518
He's not "every guy", you know?

18:09.551 --> 18:12.655
Fair argument.
But the weirdo loves you, okay?

18:12.687 --> 18:15.757
So speak from the heart,
and he'll understand.

18:15.791 --> 18:18.127
- Thank you.
- Yep.

18:18.159 --> 18:20.028
And again, congratulations.

18:21.663 --> 18:23.532
- Oh, is this what we do now?
- Yeah, come on.

18:23.564 --> 18:25.500
- Come here.
- It's our handshake.

18:25.533 --> 18:28.637
Thank you so much... for coming.

18:28.669 --> 18:29.804
I'm gonna go clean.

18:29.838 --> 18:32.207
All right, go clean.

18:39.915 --> 18:42.385
<i>The night had started
with me trying to help Luca</i>

18:42.417 --> 18:44.853
<i>take a step towards
getting his dream job.</i>

18:44.887 --> 18:47.857
<i>So the thought of telling him
that</i> I <i> got it instead</i>

18:47.889 --> 18:49.492
<i>had me on edge.</i>

18:49.524 --> 18:51.560
<i>But I decided to speak from my heart</i>

18:51.592 --> 18:54.397
<i>and hoped Luca would be okay
with everything.</i>

18:54.429 --> 18:56.197
Hey, babe. I was wondering...

18:56.231 --> 18:57.533
Oh, wow.

18:57.565 --> 18:58.733
What? Everything okay?

18:58.766 --> 19:01.302
Joey Bada$$ just followed me on IG.

19:01.336 --> 19:04.507
Wow. Uh, that's amazing.

19:06.108 --> 19:09.078
Told you, babe. Riding my own wave.

19:09.110 --> 19:11.179
Yeah, excellent.

19:11.213 --> 19:12.815
Yeah.

19:12.848 --> 19:14.550
<i>So I decided to go to sleep</i>

19:14.582 --> 19:18.653
<i>and tell Luca I was pursuing
my own dreams tomorrow.</i>

19:25.293 --> 19:26.428
Fall back.

19:26.462 --> 19:28.196
I totally screwed up, didn't I?

19:37.473 --> 19:39.042
Baby, you okay?

19:42.110 --> 19:45.214
No. Um...

19:45.246 --> 19:47.417
actually, there's something
I need to tell you.

19:51.919 --> 19:53.721
Hey, excuse me.
So sorry to interrupt, guys.

19:53.754 --> 19:55.558
Uh, I just want to say thank you
for an amazing night.

19:55.590 --> 19:57.292
You really took it from here to here.

19:57.325 --> 19:59.461
- Just next level, you know?
- No doubt, no doubt. Appreciate it.

19:59.494 --> 20:01.030
I was wondering if you'd be interested

20:01.062 --> 20:03.264
in commemorating the night
just to, you know, kind of...

20:03.298 --> 20:05.868
Bro, you're either asking me
for a picture or on a date,

20:05.900 --> 20:08.303
and I'm only down to do
one of those, to be clear.

20:08.337 --> 20:09.872
Perfect. Right this way.

20:09.905 --> 20:12.074
Just to be clear, this <i> is</i> a picture?

20:12.107 --> 20:13.075
Just a picture.

20:15.577 --> 20:17.079
Big fan, bro.

20:17.111 --> 20:18.880
Just get in there, all right? Scooch.

20:18.914 --> 20:21.283
- Part of the business.
- All right.

20:22.751 --> 20:24.253
Shit, okay.

20:24.285 --> 20:25.787

- Let's get the first one.

Hey, the picture's coming in 3, 2...

20:29.315 --> 20:30.631
Can you just move, bro?

20:30.656 --> 20:31.864
He wants the picture with me.

20:31.889 --> 20:33.896
I-I kind of put him on to, like,
the music and all.

20:35.030 --> 20:36.799
Do you like Biggie?
I'm a huge Biggie fan.

20:36.831 --> 20:38.600
He probably inspired your lyrics, huh?

20:38.633 --> 20:40.835
He made you <i> you.</i> I like that.

20:40.869 --> 20:42.237
- Think we got this.
- No, no, I think we just...

20:42.271 --> 20:43.772
- just one more shot.
- Just one second, just...

20:43.804 --> 20:45.073
