‐ Oh, my goodness.

00:13.326 --> 00:14.328
<i>of their lives...</i>

00:14.328 --> 00:15.698
One apron up for grabs.

00:15.698 --> 00:17.969
I'm gonna love
watching you leave.

00:17.969 --> 00:19.806
<i>11 survived...</i>

00:19.806 --> 00:23.046
That gives me hope that what
I chose to do with my life

00:23.046 --> 00:26.319
is gonna be carried on
by the new generation.

00:26.319 --> 00:28.490
<i>and claimed</i>
<i>the coveted white apron,</i>

00:28.490 --> 00:31.129
<i>earning a place</i>
<i>in the top 20.</i>

00:33.066 --> 00:34.068
<i>Tonight...</i>

00:34.068 --> 00:36.306
Watch very carefully.

00:36.306 --> 00:40.915
<i>the search for America's</i>
<i>next MasterChef continues.</i>

00:40.915 --> 00:42.351
It doesn't get
any tougher than this.

00:42.351 --> 00:43.688
It sure doesn't.

00:43.688 --> 00:44.823
Whoo!

00:44.823 --> 00:46.760
<i>Only nine</i>
<i>white aprons remain.</i>

00:46.760 --> 00:48.029
Huge amounts of jeopardy.

00:48.029 --> 00:50.100
<i>And this year's talent...</i>

00:50.100 --> 00:51.402
Christina:
Oh, don't touch it.

00:51.402 --> 00:52.672
<i>is hotter than ever.</i>

00:52.672 --> 00:54.610
The idea was flambéing
the steak, not the stove.

00:54.610 --> 00:57.181
<i>With some of the most</i>
<i>shocking battles...</i>

00:57.181 --> 00:58.684
Tonight,
you'll be making...

00:58.684 --> 01:00.020
Ugh.

01:00.020 --> 01:01.890
<i>in "MasterChef" history.</i>

01:01.890 --> 01:05.230
‐ Oh!
‐ Oh, what the...

01:12.211 --> 01:14.716
<i>The most talented</i>
<i>home cooks in America</i>

01:14.716 --> 01:16.820
<i>have been invited</i>
<i>to the MasterChef kitchen</i>

01:16.820 --> 01:20.193
<i>to compete</i>
<i>in an all‐or‐nothing</i>
<i>culinary battle.</i>

01:20.193 --> 01:22.866
I'm taking that apron.
I can't wait. I'm so amped.

01:22.866 --> 01:24.870
I'm gonna make this happen.
Don't cry. I got it.

01:24.870 --> 01:26.707
I am bringing
the heat today.

01:26.707 --> 01:27.842
Now that's what
I'm talking about.

01:27.842 --> 01:30.213
Get me in there now!

01:33.420 --> 01:35.190
<i>In the battle</i>
<i>for a white apron,</i>

01:35.190 --> 01:36.894
<i>the home cooks</i>
<i>will go head to head</i>

01:36.894 --> 01:40.067
<i>to prove they deserve one</i>
<i>of the nine remaining aprons</i>

01:40.067 --> 01:42.304
<i>and a place in the top 20.</i>

01:45.878 --> 01:47.716
Showtime, baby.
Showtime.

01:47.716 --> 01:49.720
<i>First up is Josh,</i>

01:49.720 --> 01:52.291
<i>a political consultant</i>
<i>from Cincinnati, Ohio,</i>

01:52.291 --> 01:54.228
<i>who's hoping his veal dish</i>

01:54.228 --> 01:56.265
<i>will win him a white apron.</i>

01:56.265 --> 01:57.802
Josh: <i>Being a political</i>
<i>consultant,</i>

01:57.802 --> 01:59.405
It's a job.
It's not my passion.

01:59.405 --> 02:00.575
Cooking is my passion.

02:00.575 --> 02:03.514
Three, two, one, go!

02:03.514 --> 02:05.417
<i>At our house,</i>
<i>we don't talk politics.</i>

02:05.417 --> 02:07.856
When I get home, it's about
being with the kids,

02:07.856 --> 02:08.858
being with the family,
and cooking.

02:08.858 --> 02:10.427
All right.

02:10.427 --> 02:12.932
These are
my MasterChef Juniors
at work here.

02:12.932 --> 02:14.068
Completely self‐taught.

02:14.068 --> 02:16.540
<i>I make rubs,</i>
<i>I make sauces, glazes.</i>

02:16.540 --> 02:18.109
Gotta have a grill
in the house.

02:18.109 --> 02:19.946
<i>I create masterpieces</i>
<i>on the grill.</i>

02:19.946 --> 02:21.750
<i>I love the creativity</i>

02:21.750 --> 02:23.386
<i>of taking</i>
<i>your standard barbecue</i>

02:23.386 --> 02:24.823
and elevating it.

02:24.823 --> 02:26.225
We got the veal parmigiana.
It's gonna be awesome.

02:26.225 --> 02:27.796
You know
it's my favorite dish.

02:27.796 --> 02:29.231
I know it's your favorite.
That's why I'm cooking it.

02:29.231 --> 02:30.467
It's my signature, baby.

02:30.467 --> 02:32.304
I want people to see
that a regular guy

02:32.304 --> 02:34.475
who cooks in his backyard
every day

02:34.475 --> 02:36.078
can do something special.

02:36.078 --> 02:37.247
I'm gonna bring
that white apron

02:37.247 --> 02:38.851
right out that door
today for you.

02:38.851 --> 02:40.187
You got this, Dad.

02:40.187 --> 02:41.189
So who
you going up against?

02:44.195 --> 02:46.767
Dino: <i>My name is Dino,</i>
<i>I'm 28 years of age,</i>

02:46.767 --> 02:48.036
I'm from Bensonhurst,
New York,

02:48.036 --> 02:50.440
and I'm a ballet dancer.

02:50.440 --> 02:51.944
<i>Some people think I'm crazy.</i>

02:51.944 --> 02:53.012
I don't think they're wrong.

02:53.012 --> 02:55.150
The Sicilian boy's
gonna win this one.

02:55.150 --> 02:56.520
‐ Right.
‐ Right.

02:56.520 --> 02:58.389
<i>Growing up, there was always</i>
<i>meat on the table.</i>

02:58.389 --> 03:01.462
My family, was, you know,
carnivores, like crazy.

03:01.462 --> 03:02.932
You remember
when I was young,

03:02.932 --> 03:04.569
and that was always
my favorite dish,
was the veal?

03:04.569 --> 03:06.439
‐ Yes.
‐ Now I won't eat it
'cause I'm vegan.

03:06.439 --> 03:08.009
<i>I was always obsessed</i>
<i>with being healthy,</i>

03:08.009 --> 03:09.245
<i>with eating the right foods,</i>

03:09.245 --> 03:10.313
<i>and I choose to be vegan.</i>

03:10.313 --> 03:11.650
<i>Not only for the animals,</i>

03:11.650 --> 03:14.154
but, uh, because, you know,
it keeps me in shape.

03:14.154 --> 03:15.658
This is probably gonna be
the best veal I've ever made.

03:15.658 --> 03:17.494
He's gonna quit cooking
after this whole thing.

03:17.494 --> 03:19.633
I'm Sicilian,
so I've been cooking veal

03:19.633 --> 03:21.269
in my sleep since I was 13.

03:21.269 --> 03:23.540
<i>I'm gonna dance circles</i>
<i>around this guy.</i>

03:23.540 --> 03:25.310
This is it!

03:34.028 --> 03:36.032
Welcome, guys.
Come on down.

03:36.032 --> 03:37.034
This is awesome.

03:37.034 --> 03:38.469
I'm so ready
for this battle.

03:38.469 --> 03:40.073
I'm not nervous at all.

03:40.073 --> 03:41.810
<i>My veal is gonna be better</i>
<i>than Dino's veal</i>

03:41.810 --> 03:44.148
<i>because I'm gonna put</i>
<i>my heart and soul into it.</i>

03:44.148 --> 03:46.485
I'm here to win.
There's no other option.

03:48.991 --> 03:51.429
Josh and Dino,
we're challenging you

03:51.429 --> 03:54.034
to a battle
of veal parmigiana.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.103
Yes, sir.

03:55.103 --> 03:56.506
Gentlemen, in this battle,

03:56.506 --> 03:59.546
you're gonna have 30 minutes
to cook a veal parmigiana

03:59.546 --> 04:01.382
to your absolute best.

04:01.382 --> 04:02.618
‐ Are we ready?
‐ Oh, yeah.

04:02.618 --> 04:05.992
Your 30 minutes starts now.

04:12.204 --> 04:13.974
Josh, the love of food
comes from where?

04:13.974 --> 04:16.145
Growing up, my parents
always ordered out

04:16.145 --> 04:18.584
or we ate stuff out of a can
or out of a box,

04:18.584 --> 04:20.053
and so when
I became a father,

04:20.053 --> 04:22.825
I decided that it was
important to teach my kids

04:22.825 --> 04:25.397
the importance of organic,
fresh ingredients.

04:25.397 --> 04:26.533
Right.
Tell us about the dish.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.102
I'm gonna make
a basic red sauce

04:28.102 --> 04:31.208
with sweet onions,
some garlic, tomato paste,

04:31.208 --> 04:32.678
a little sugar to give it
a little sweetness.

04:32.678 --> 04:34.114
I'm gonna cook the veal,

04:34.114 --> 04:38.289
and then I'm gonna add
a little basil ricotta
mixture to it.

04:38.289 --> 04:39.592
Guys, just over
ten minutes gone.

04:39.592 --> 04:41.028
Is there a clock in here?

04:41.028 --> 04:43.600
Yep, just in front of you.
The giant one.

04:43.600 --> 04:46.038
‐ Got it.
‐ Just under 20 minutes to go.

04:50.146 --> 04:52.752
Dino, where'd you get
your love for cooking?

04:52.752 --> 04:55.123
My grandmother
used to chase me around
with a spatula.

04:55.123 --> 04:57.628
She said,
"You're gonna have to cook
for a big family one day."

04:57.628 --> 04:59.799
She was right.
They're gonna disown me
if I lose.

04:59.799 --> 05:03.072
So, Dino, what is it
about your veal parmigiana

05:03.072 --> 05:04.576
that's could make you
get that apron?

05:04.576 --> 05:06.513
I'm making you
two different sauces today.

05:06.513 --> 05:08.951
One for the veggies,
one for the veal parmigiana.

05:08.951 --> 05:11.188
The bottom's gonna be
a classic Sicilian gravy,

05:11.188 --> 05:13.259
but the top's gonna be
a pomodoro crema.

05:13.259 --> 05:15.363
I'm using thyme,
fresh basil, and spinach.

05:15.363 --> 05:18.035
The way that the flavors
infuse together,
you're gonna love it.

05:18.035 --> 05:21.075
Gordon:
Last ten minutes, guys.

05:21.075 --> 05:22.444
Baby doll.

05:22.444 --> 05:23.881
Here's the beauty
of this competition.

05:23.881 --> 05:26.051
Two complete
opposite individuals,

05:26.051 --> 05:28.757
but cooking the same
veal parmigiana.

05:28.757 --> 05:31.262
Christina:
Josh sounds like he's gonna
take the high‐end approach.

05:31.262 --> 05:33.399
He's got some polenta
working over there.

05:33.399 --> 05:34.736
Getting good there.

05:34.736 --> 05:38.075
How do you get that polenta
cooked in such a short time?

05:38.075 --> 05:39.779
Dino has two preparations.

05:39.779 --> 05:42.618
He has a pomodoro crema,
and he has a classic gravy.

05:42.618 --> 05:43.754
Is that out of ambitiousness?

05:43.754 --> 05:46.593
Is he trying
to show off too much?

05:46.593 --> 05:47.929
90 seconds remaining.

05:47.929 --> 05:50.668
Come on, guys.
This is it. Final push.

05:50.668 --> 05:52.838
Two veal dishes,
one apron, up for grabs.

05:52.838 --> 05:54.141
‐ Let's go.
‐ Come on now.

05:54.141 --> 05:57.113
‐ Plate with finesse.
‐ Come on, guys.

05:57.113 --> 05:59.284
Aarón: Let's push right
to the finish line, guys.

05:59.284 --> 06:01.556
Judges:
10, nine, eight,

06:01.556 --> 06:03.794
seven, six, five,

06:03.794 --> 06:06.600
four, three, two,

06:06.600 --> 06:08.002
one, and stop.

06:08.002 --> 06:09.071
‐ That's it.
‐ Hands in the air.

06:09.071 --> 06:11.643
Gordon:
Well done.

06:11.643 --> 06:13.981
‐ All right.
‐ Whoo!

06:13.981 --> 06:16.686
Gentlemen, please bring
your veal parmigianas

06:16.686 --> 06:19.424
to the table very gently.

06:23.934 --> 06:25.838
All right, Josh,
talk to me a little bit

06:25.838 --> 06:27.708
about your take
on veal parmigiana.

06:27.708 --> 06:29.612
Josh:
<i>I stuck true to what I knew,</i>

06:29.612 --> 06:32.050
<i>which is top it</i>
<i>with homemade red sauce.</i>

06:32.050 --> 06:33.687
<i>That's one</i>
<i>of my family recipes.</i>

06:33.687 --> 06:36.125
<i>And then I made a basil</i>
<i>ricotta cheese mixture</i>

06:36.125 --> 06:38.162
<i>that I layered in between</i>
<i>the mozzarella</i>

06:38.162 --> 06:40.166
<i>and then plated it over</i>
<i>a creamy polenta.</i>

06:40.166 --> 06:42.805
It seems like there's
a lot on top of this.

06:42.805 --> 06:45.043
A ton of mozzarella,
it looks like.

06:45.043 --> 06:46.980
So let's get in here.

06:49.217 --> 06:51.756
The cook on this
is spectacular.

06:51.756 --> 06:54.929
It's juicy, it's pink,
but it's also cooked
on the outside.

06:59.204 --> 07:00.874
What's really impressive
is the seasoning

07:00.874 --> 07:02.177
you got into that veal.

07:02.177 --> 07:03.714
Just the way it should be.

07:03.714 --> 07:05.884
There's a certain rusticity
to that sauce.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.888
Big chunks of tomato,
flavored really beautiful

07:07.888 --> 07:09.324
with that onion
and that garlic.

07:09.324 --> 07:11.161
The ricotta crema,
I love that.

07:11.161 --> 07:12.464
It's fresh, it's bright.

07:12.464 --> 07:14.802
I mean, that, for me,
right there is remarkable.

07:14.802 --> 07:17.140
Thank you.

07:19.144 --> 07:21.248
You know,
polenta needs time.

07:21.248 --> 07:22.551
Why the hell
did you put that on

07:22.551 --> 07:23.553
with 4 1/2 minutes to go?

07:23.553 --> 07:25.022
I lost my train of thought.

07:28.997 --> 07:30.601
The veal's actually
cooked beautifully.

07:30.601 --> 07:32.505
‐ Thank you.
‐ It needs to be
slightly thinner,

07:32.505 --> 07:35.677
but, you know,
for me there's elements
of brilliance there,

07:35.677 --> 07:36.946
but the polenta
with five minutes to go?

07:36.946 --> 07:38.182
Do you know
what I would have done?

07:38.182 --> 07:39.184
I wouldn't have bothered.

07:39.184 --> 07:40.521
Absolutely right.

07:40.521 --> 07:42.457
It's just a shame,
because you clearly can cook.

07:42.457 --> 07:44.394
‐ Let's get that right, okay?
‐ Thank you.

07:49.939 --> 07:51.876
Dino, your take
on a veal parmigiana?

07:51.876 --> 07:55.551
From the bottom up,
you have a classic
Sicilian gravy.

07:55.551 --> 07:58.456
<i>On the top of that, you have</i>
<i>Italian squash and zucchini.</i>

07:58.456 --> 08:01.563
<i>On top of that, I put crispy</i>
<i>potatoes and mozzarella.</i>

08:01.563 --> 08:04.334
<i>And on top I have</i>
<i>a tomato cream sauce.</i>

08:04.334 --> 08:05.904
I'm gonna cut through
the middle of this veal.

08:05.904 --> 08:09.110
I wanna see a nice, pink,
juicy color in the center.

08:10.112 --> 08:11.281
Let's take a look.

08:14.421 --> 08:16.860
Looks pretty great.
It's slightly pink.

08:16.860 --> 08:18.429
Glistening and juicy
in the center there.

08:23.138 --> 08:24.976
I was worried about
the time that you spent

08:24.976 --> 08:26.913
in making those two
tomato sauces,

08:26.913 --> 08:30.386
but they definitely
bring two different
flavor profiles in.

08:30.386 --> 08:32.457
Your veal is cooked nicely.
Good job.

08:32.457 --> 08:33.560
Thank you.

08:35.229 --> 08:39.070
Love the color on the veal,
but why two tomato sauces?

08:39.070 --> 08:41.943
The sauce on the bottom,
I typically like
with vegetables.

08:41.943 --> 08:45.483
For the veal,
I like a creamier sauce.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.320
The veal's
cooked beautifully.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.523
Nice, even breading.

08:48.523 --> 08:49.759
The sauce is delicious.

08:49.759 --> 08:51.361
However, you got
slightly carried away

08:51.361 --> 08:52.631
with the vegetable layers.

08:52.631 --> 08:54.502
It looks a little bit
sort of clumsy.

08:54.502 --> 08:55.504
You need to pull back
a little bit.

08:55.504 --> 08:57.206
‐ Thank you.
‐ Thank you.

08:59.779 --> 09:02.317
‐ It's a tough one.
‐ It's not easy.

09:02.317 --> 09:04.822
‐ They're both talented.
‐ I agree.

09:04.822 --> 09:10.066
Two home cooks,
two very different
approaches to veal.

09:10.066 --> 09:12.236
There's only one apron.

09:16.613 --> 09:18.516
This apron represents a place

09:18.516 --> 09:21.188
in the biggest cooking
competition on the planet.

09:23.827 --> 09:25.764
This apron belongs to...

09:32.678 --> 09:35.651
Two very different
approaches to veal.

09:35.651 --> 09:38.288
But there's only one apron.

09:38.288 --> 09:40.994
This apron represents a place

09:40.994 --> 09:45.403
in the biggest cooking
competition on the planet.

09:45.403 --> 09:49.578
And this apron belongs to...

09:52.050 --> 09:53.820
‐ Come on, Dino.
‐ Come on, son.

09:53.820 --> 09:55.991
‐ Here we go.
‐ Ready?

10:00.332 --> 10:02.771
Whoo!

10:07.681 --> 10:09.250
What are you gonna do?

10:09.250 --> 10:11.254
‐ You did good, Dad.
‐ Thanks, buddy. Thanks.

10:11.254 --> 10:13.793
I'm so proud of you.

10:13.793 --> 10:14.962
In the MasterChef kitchen,

10:14.962 --> 10:15.964
you're gonna expect
a lot of dancing,

10:15.964 --> 10:18.368
<i>a lot of shaking this booty,</i>

10:18.368 --> 10:20.039
and, uh, my food?

10:20.039 --> 10:21.041
Forget about it.

10:26.953 --> 10:28.923
Announcer:
<i>Up next is Taylor,</i>

10:28.923 --> 10:31.061
<i>a 29‐year‐old</i>
<i>digital marketer</i>

10:31.061 --> 10:32.598
<i>from Austin, Texas...</i>

10:32.598 --> 10:34.167
Bringing it back
from Texas, y'all.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.570
Oh, yeah.

10:35.570 --> 10:37.273
<i>...who's back</i>
<i>for a second chance</i>

10:37.273 --> 10:39.444
<i>at earning</i>
<i>a coveted white apron.</i>

10:39.444 --> 10:40.981
So last time
I cooked cupcakes.

10:40.981 --> 10:44.087
This time I have
absolutely no idea

10:44.087 --> 10:45.857
what they're gonna
throw at me.

10:45.857 --> 10:48.162
I'm back for redemption.

10:48.162 --> 10:52.971
This is hard. One apron is
going to Andrea.

10:52.971 --> 10:55.309
When I lost that white apron,

10:55.309 --> 10:57.648
<i>it lit a fire under me.</i>

10:57.648 --> 10:59.885
‐ Taylor, don't give up.
‐ I'll be back.

10:59.885 --> 11:02.958
It made me want to come back
with a vengeance.

11:02.958 --> 11:05.262
I'm not walking
out that door again

11:05.262 --> 11:07.066
without that apron in my hand.

11:07.066 --> 11:08.603
My passion of food

11:08.603 --> 11:10.907
absolutely came from
my mom's side of the family,

11:10.907 --> 11:12.945
<i>which is from Colombia.</i>

11:12.945 --> 11:16.919
<i>So this time around,</i>
<i>I'm going to incorporate</i>
<i>my roots of Colombia.</i>

11:16.919 --> 11:18.488
Shrimp gumbo.

11:18.488 --> 11:21.596
And hopefully
redeem myself and win.

11:21.596 --> 11:24.969
This time you're gonna
really kick some butt, though.

11:24.969 --> 11:28.342
Announcer: <i>Standing</i>
<i>in Taylor's way is Cate,</i>

11:28.342 --> 11:31.281
<i>a 25‐year‐old</i>
<i>nutritionist from Chicago...</i>

11:31.281 --> 11:32.551
This time it's meant to be.

11:32.551 --> 11:33.820
I'm just‐‐
I'm gonna bring it down.

11:33.820 --> 11:36.291
<i>...who is also returning</i>
<i>from last season</i>

11:36.291 --> 11:38.863
<i>to claim a spot</i>
<i>in the MasterChef kitchen.</i>

11:38.863 --> 11:40.800
It's not a ten,
I have to be honest with you.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.905
But you can cook,
let's get that right.

11:42.905 --> 11:44.040
Don't stop.

11:44.040 --> 11:47.013
The blow of losing
was so hard to face.

11:47.013 --> 11:49.652
I was, like,
heartbroken, for sure.

11:49.652 --> 11:52.557
But in life, you just
have to get back up

11:52.557 --> 11:53.893
and keep fighting.

11:53.893 --> 11:57.935
<i>So I am coming back</i>
<i>stronger and smarter</i>

11:57.935 --> 12:00.272
<i>and a better chef</i>
<i>than I was last time.</i>

12:00.272 --> 12:02.544
Second chance,
redemption, it's mine.

12:02.544 --> 12:05.215
So growing up,
I was a total tomboy.

12:05.215 --> 12:08.355
<i>I hunted and fished</i>
<i>with my dad.</i>

12:08.355 --> 12:10.994
<i>I will shoot the bird,</i>
<i>take it back,</i>

12:10.994 --> 12:12.831
<i>pluck it,</i>
<i>gut it, clean it,</i>

12:12.831 --> 12:14.400
<i>and then serve it to you,</i>

12:14.400 --> 12:16.338
<i>and it will be</i>
<i>a delicious meal.</i>

12:16.338 --> 12:18.375
Homemade venison chili.

12:18.375 --> 12:20.847
My uncle shot the deer.
I cooked it.

12:20.847 --> 12:22.751
<i>I'm not scared of anything,</i>

12:22.751 --> 12:24.020
and I'm here to win.

12:29.397 --> 12:30.767
Taylor:
<i>Catelin and I are both</i>

12:30.767 --> 12:33.005
<i>going into a battle</i>
<i>today for the second time,</i>

12:33.005 --> 12:35.677
and only one of us can win,
and that's gonna be me.

12:39.518 --> 12:40.854
Come on down, please.

12:40.854 --> 12:42.858
Cate:
<i>I have listened</i>
<i>to everything</i>

12:42.858 --> 12:44.862
<i>the judges</i>
<i>said to me last time,</i>

12:44.862 --> 12:46.431
<i>corrected it, studied,</i>

12:46.431 --> 12:48.903
and only came back
stronger, bigger,

12:48.903 --> 12:50.205
and badder than ever.

12:50.205 --> 12:51.207
<i>I'm ready.</i>

12:51.207 --> 12:53.946
First of all, welcome back.

12:53.946 --> 12:54.948
‐ Thank you.
‐ Thanks.

12:54.948 --> 12:56.552
It's good to be back.

12:56.552 --> 13:00.660
Taylor, Catelin, for your
redemption battle tonight,

13:00.660 --> 13:04.735
you will both be working
with a chef's dream.

13:04.735 --> 13:08.509
It is, of course, salmon.

13:08.509 --> 13:11.247
‐ Oh.
‐ Oh, yes.

13:11.247 --> 13:13.786
I am about to show you
the perfect way

13:13.786 --> 13:16.759
to fillet a salmon.

13:18.261 --> 13:19.565
Razor‐sharp knife.

13:19.565 --> 13:21.535
Let the knife do the work.

13:21.535 --> 13:23.906
Start off at the top
of the head.

13:23.906 --> 13:26.111
Press the tip
all the way down

13:26.111 --> 13:27.547
the center bone
to the very end.

13:27.547 --> 13:30.720
Clean knife
every time you go in.

13:30.720 --> 13:33.659
Go over that rib cage,
through the dorsal fin,

13:33.659 --> 13:35.395
and cut out.

13:35.395 --> 13:39.070
Now, get as close
to the spine as possible.

13:39.070 --> 13:41.775
Come through all the way
down to the tail and out.

13:41.775 --> 13:44.447
I want to see
a clean carcass.

13:44.447 --> 13:47.019
I don't wanna see any flesh
of that salmon left on there.

13:47.019 --> 13:51.094
Now, portion‐wise,
it's eight ounces per portion.

13:51.094 --> 13:54.300
One, two,

13:54.300 --> 13:57.106
three, four.

13:57.106 --> 13:59.545
Keeping the knife
nice and straight.

13:59.545 --> 14:03.051
Now match each piece.

14:04.988 --> 14:08.395
And that is how
you fillet a salmon

14:08.395 --> 14:09.798
like a true MasterChef.

14:09.798 --> 14:11.467
Oh, gosh.

14:11.467 --> 14:15.075
Right, in your battle,
you're gonna have 45 minutes

14:15.075 --> 14:17.948
to compose a MasterChef‐
worthy salmon dish.

14:17.948 --> 14:20.152
‐ Are we ready?
‐ Yes, Chef.

14:20.152 --> 14:21.321
It doesn't get
any tougher than this.

14:21.321 --> 14:22.591
It sure doesn't.

14:22.591 --> 14:25.663
Your 45 minutes starts...

14:27.499 --> 14:28.836
now.

14:34.781 --> 14:37.186
Taylor, give us
some insight to the dish.
What are you cooking?

14:37.186 --> 14:40.325
I am gonna cook
a crispy skin salmon

14:40.325 --> 14:43.465
served with cilantro rice,
asparagus,

14:43.465 --> 14:46.972
and a mango radish
jalapeno salsa.

14:46.972 --> 14:49.243
This dish
is my grandmother's recipe.

14:49.243 --> 14:52.684
It's inspired from
a classic Colombian dish

14:52.684 --> 14:55.489
which is a fish and rice
that are always
served together.

14:55.489 --> 14:58.228
Taylor,
what's on the line
this season?

14:58.228 --> 15:00.432
You know what? That apron
is everything to me.

15:00.432 --> 15:01.935
Everything is on
the line right now.

15:06.311 --> 15:08.114
Cate, talk me
through the dish.

15:08.114 --> 15:10.485
I am making
a pan‐seared salmon

15:10.485 --> 15:13.058
with spiced potato,
charred corn,

15:13.058 --> 15:15.295
and then I'm serving it
in a rasam broth.

15:15.295 --> 15:18.368
The broth, it's sort of
Southern Indian‐inspired.

15:18.368 --> 15:21.174
Yeah, because I'm keeping
the salmon so simple,

15:21.174 --> 15:22.844
I'm letting
the bold essence of the broth

15:22.844 --> 15:25.550
kind of infuse
the flavors of the fish.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.252
I listened to what
you guys said last time,

15:27.252 --> 15:28.923
and since I've been back,

15:28.923 --> 15:32.196
I've just been at home,
like, cooking my ass off,

15:32.196 --> 15:34.166
so I'm excited
to show you guys
what I've learned.

15:34.166 --> 15:36.237
Well, we're excited to see.

15:36.237 --> 15:38.843
Ladies,
we're down to ten minutes.

15:40.178 --> 15:41.548
Whew.

15:41.548 --> 15:43.451
Taylor's dish
sounds very simple,

15:43.451 --> 15:44.453
but, I mean,
if it's executed brilliantly,

15:44.453 --> 15:46.692
then it could be mind‐blowing.

15:46.692 --> 15:50.365
I have to commend
the workload going on
in Catelin's dish

15:50.365 --> 15:52.302
because
she is multitasking
beyond belief.

15:54.306 --> 15:58.314
Ladies, we are down
to 60 seconds remaining.

15:58.314 --> 15:59.951
Aarón:
Make this your best.

15:59.951 --> 16:02.489
‐ Taste everything.
‐ Think of all
the elements, ladies.

16:02.489 --> 16:04.594
Christina:
Push yourself.

16:04.594 --> 16:07.166
Judges:
Ten, nine, eight,

16:07.166 --> 16:10.238
seven, six, five,

16:10.238 --> 16:13.546
four, three, two,

16:13.546 --> 16:14.848
one, and stop.

16:14.848 --> 16:17.085
‐ Whoo!
‐ Hands in the air.

16:17.085 --> 16:18.188
Well done.

16:24.366 --> 16:27.774
Gordon:
Taylor, Catelin‐‐
two individual styles,

16:27.774 --> 16:30.378
only one apron up for grabs.

16:30.378 --> 16:32.149
Right, down to
the most important part‐‐

16:32.149 --> 16:33.619
how do they taste?

16:33.619 --> 16:35.489
Taylor,
describe the dish please.

16:35.489 --> 16:38.495
<i>This is a crispy</i>
<i>salmon fillet</i>

16:38.495 --> 16:43.338
<i>over a garlic cilantro rice,</i>
<i>asparagus,</i>

16:43.338 --> 16:46.812
<i>and finished with a mango</i>
<i>radish jalapeno salsa.</i>

16:46.812 --> 16:48.348
How'd you cook the salmon?

16:48.348 --> 16:50.018
I cooked the salmon
over a little olive oil,

16:50.018 --> 16:53.024
salt and pepper,
on a non‐stick skillet.

16:53.024 --> 16:54.628
Yeah.
Salmon's cooked nice.

16:54.628 --> 16:55.663
Thank you, Chef.

16:59.270 --> 17:00.940
The salmon, you've nailed.

17:00.940 --> 17:02.109
You filleted it
beautifully.

17:02.109 --> 17:04.881
The salsa's nice,
but I wanted to see

17:04.881 --> 17:06.417
a little bit more
creativity on the rice,

17:06.417 --> 17:08.221
'cause the rice
is sort of bland.

17:08.221 --> 17:09.490
Just the whole presentation

17:09.490 --> 17:10.993
could have gone
a little bit further.

17:10.993 --> 17:12.597
Thank you, Chef.

17:20.111 --> 17:22.817
The most remarkable
element of this dish

17:22.817 --> 17:25.488
is how much flavor
you were able to get
into that salsa.

17:25.488 --> 17:28.428
It helps cut the richness
and fattiness of that salmon.

17:28.428 --> 17:30.432
That's a really welcome
addition to your dish.

17:30.432 --> 17:31.802
Thank you, Chef.

17:31.802 --> 17:34.473
But placing that
delicious salsa on top of it

17:34.473 --> 17:36.143
negates any texture

17:36.143 --> 17:37.981
that you were hoping
to achieve with that skin.

17:37.981 --> 17:40.118
The asparagus
is a little boring,

17:40.118 --> 17:43.124
but dynamite salsa.

17:43.124 --> 17:45.061
Gordon:
Cate, describe
the dish please.

17:45.061 --> 17:47.032
<i>I have a pan‐seared salmon</i>

17:47.032 --> 17:49.838
<i>with spiced potato,</i>
<i>charred corn,</i>

17:49.838 --> 17:51.508
<i>served in a rasam broth.</i>

17:51.508 --> 17:54.179
So why bring that Indian
tamarind spice world

17:54.179 --> 17:55.916
into a perfect piece
of salmon?

17:55.916 --> 17:57.419
So I wanted to, like,
step up my game

17:57.419 --> 17:59.256
and do something different.

17:59.256 --> 18:01.460
You know, not play it safe.

18:01.460 --> 18:02.630
I was really wanting
to step out of the box

18:02.630 --> 18:05.468
and show you that
I've been practicing.

18:05.468 --> 18:07.540
The salmon is pink,
it's steaming,

18:07.540 --> 18:09.644
and you've got the majority
of the heat on the skin,

18:09.644 --> 18:12.115
which is the perfect way
to execute a salmon.

18:14.286 --> 18:16.290
The skin is crispy,
it tastes delicious,

18:16.290 --> 18:17.459
and it sort of
melts in your mouth.

18:17.459 --> 18:19.329
Broth is wonderful.

18:19.329 --> 18:21.635
Touch too heavy
on the tamarind,

18:21.635 --> 18:23.404
'cause it's quite tart
and sour.

18:23.404 --> 18:25.643
Potatoes, tomatoes, corn,

18:25.643 --> 18:27.647
you know,
it's over‐generous.

18:27.647 --> 18:29.751
‐ So take a little bit out.
‐ Yeah.

18:29.751 --> 18:32.489
But what you've got in there
is a strong work ethic.

18:40.539 --> 18:42.543
You clearly
did a beautiful job

18:42.543 --> 18:45.281
butchering your salmon,
cooking your salmon.

18:45.281 --> 18:48.121
You showed confidence in
building flavor in this dish.

18:48.121 --> 18:51.227
That said,
the dish is pretty large.

18:51.227 --> 18:52.429
It's a little clunky.

18:52.429 --> 18:54.534
There's a lot of other flavors

18:54.534 --> 18:56.538
that are competing
with the star of the dish.

18:56.538 --> 18:58.942
I'm not sure that the balance

18:58.942 --> 19:00.880
is good enough
to win you that apron.

19:06.357 --> 19:10.231
There's still some
improvements to be made
on both dishes,

19:10.231 --> 19:12.269
but I think
the winner is clear.

19:12.269 --> 19:13.772
Yeah, hands down.

19:15.341 --> 19:17.613
My heart is beating so fast.

19:17.613 --> 19:21.621
Ladies, you came back in

19:21.621 --> 19:25.361
hoping to win
that elusive white apron

19:25.361 --> 19:27.867
that just slipped through
your fingers last time.

19:27.867 --> 19:30.806
We have a unanimous decision.

19:30.806 --> 19:31.875
Oh, my God.

19:39.791 --> 19:40.960
Congratulations...

19:46.437 --> 19:48.675
Come on, honey.

19:50.078 --> 19:52.315
( cheering )

20:07.112 --> 20:09.951
Taylor:
<i>It hurts, but I gave</i>
<i>it my all this time,</i>

20:09.951 --> 20:11.988
and I was happy
with what I put in front.

20:11.988 --> 20:15.963
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>Catelin just brought something</i>
<i>stronger to the table.</i>

20:15.963 --> 20:17.633
My heart goes out
to Catelin for this

20:17.633 --> 20:19.136
and to push through
and win it.

20:21.508 --> 20:22.977
I have been waiting
for this moment

20:22.977 --> 20:24.747
for the longest time
since last season.

20:24.747 --> 20:27.419
Like blood, sweat,
gallons of tears.

20:27.419 --> 20:29.089
Somebody pinch me.
Pinch me.

20:29.089 --> 20:31.661
It feels unreal
to be standing here

20:31.661 --> 20:33.197
with an apron on.

20:40.345 --> 20:42.382
Announcer:
<i>Our next battle</i>
<i>features steak</i>

20:42.382 --> 20:43.952
<i>and four talented home cooks</i>

20:43.952 --> 20:46.524
<i>who will put everything</i>
<i>on the line</i>

20:46.524 --> 20:49.029
<i>to win two white aprons.</i>

20:49.029 --> 20:50.532
Michael:
<i>My name is Michael,</i>

20:50.532 --> 20:51.735
I'm from North Arlington,
New Jersey,

20:51.735 --> 20:53.872
<i>and I am a former COO</i>

20:53.872 --> 20:55.208
<i>of a private equity firm.</i>

20:55.208 --> 20:56.544
I've been competing
in martial arts

20:56.544 --> 20:58.214
<i>since I was a little kid.</i>

20:58.214 --> 21:00.451
<i>I got my black belt</i>
<i>when I was 13 years old.</i>

21:00.451 --> 21:02.322
I strive to be the best
in any competition.

21:02.322 --> 21:04.660
<i>So that apron?</i>
<i>It's mine.</i>

21:06.430 --> 21:08.234
Brien:
<i>My name's Brien,</i>
<i>I'm 32 years old,</i>

21:08.234 --> 21:09.504
from Redding, California.

21:09.504 --> 21:11.407
<i>I am cocky.</i>

21:11.407 --> 21:12.777
My competitors
are gonna look at me

21:12.777 --> 21:14.112
as a huge threat.

21:14.112 --> 21:16.016
<i>The women are gonna</i>
<i>wanna sleep with me.</i>

21:16.016 --> 21:18.220
<i>The men are gonna</i>
<i>want to be me.</i>

21:18.220 --> 21:19.289
<i>This is the battle</i>
<i>of steak,</i>

21:19.289 --> 21:20.692
and you know
what I'm gonna do?

21:20.692 --> 21:22.195
Stake my competition
into the ground

21:22.195 --> 21:24.099
and walk out
with that white apron.

21:24.099 --> 21:25.636
Yeah!

21:25.636 --> 21:28.040
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

21:28.040 --> 21:29.877
Daniel:
<i>My name is Daniel.</i>

21:29.877 --> 21:31.146
I'm a substitute teacher
from Medford, Massachusetts,

21:31.146 --> 21:32.449
<i>outside of Boston.</i>

21:32.449 --> 21:35.221
Coming out with that apron!
Number one!

21:35.221 --> 21:36.724
The pride I take in my food

21:36.724 --> 21:39.396
is very similar to the pride
that we take in our city.

21:39.396 --> 21:41.835
<i>My Boston pride</i>
<i>and my Boston attitude</i>

21:41.835 --> 21:43.070
<i>is gonna be</i>
<i>the winning combination</i>

21:43.070 --> 21:44.841
<i>for me to win</i>
<i>that white apron.</i>

21:47.513 --> 21:48.748
‐ Whoo!
‐ Whoa, ho, ho!

21:48.748 --> 21:50.351
All right! Welcome, guys.

21:50.351 --> 21:51.688
Aakash: <i>I'm Aakash,</i>
<i>I'm 31 years old,</i>

21:51.688 --> 21:53.124
and I'm from
Alexandria, Virginia.

21:53.124 --> 21:54.794
<i>I live in Virginia now,</i>

21:54.794 --> 21:56.698
but I grew up
11 years in India,

21:56.698 --> 21:58.300
and let me tell you,
that experience?

21:58.300 --> 21:59.537
Mind‐boggling, right?

21:59.537 --> 22:01.508
<i>The cultures,</i>
<i>the flavors, the people.</i>

22:01.508 --> 22:03.310
<i>It's just something</i>
<i>that nobody else has,</i>

22:03.310 --> 22:05.314
<i>and that uniqueness,</i>
<i>that's where I really,</i>

22:05.314 --> 22:06.784
<i>really stand out</i>
<i>from the competition.</i>

22:06.784 --> 22:08.387
I know that I got this
in the bag.

22:09.624 --> 22:13.397
Gentlemen, welcome
to the MasterChef kitchen.

22:13.397 --> 22:16.571
You're about to get a lesson
from Gordon Ramsay.

22:16.571 --> 22:18.742
I'm gonna show you
the perfect way

22:18.742 --> 22:23.785
to cook an amazing steak
served with a flambé sauce.

22:23.785 --> 22:27.125
Season your steak,
both sides, salt and pepper.

22:27.125 --> 22:29.362
Hot pan, a touch of oil.

22:29.362 --> 22:32.001
Steak in,
touch of rosemary,

22:32.001 --> 22:33.939
a sprig of thyme.

22:33.939 --> 22:36.878
Get a great sear on it,
both sides.

22:36.878 --> 22:38.280
Take it out, let it rest,

22:38.280 --> 22:40.652
and then start
that incredible sauce.

22:40.652 --> 22:44.292
A touch of butter,
your mushrooms,

22:44.292 --> 22:45.696
chopped garlic.

22:45.696 --> 22:47.967
And then, finally,
your chopped shallots.

22:47.967 --> 22:51.306
Once you got the color
on those mushrooms,
it's time to flambé.

22:51.306 --> 22:56.483
Cognac in.
Now the steak goes back in.

22:56.483 --> 22:58.855
Couple tablespoons
of stock and cream.

22:58.855 --> 23:00.324
Bring that to the boil,

23:00.324 --> 23:03.932
and literally start coating
my steak with my sauce.

23:03.932 --> 23:08.107
And from there, finish with
some chopped fresh parsley.

23:08.107 --> 23:11.446
Coat the steak
with that wonderful sauce.

23:11.446 --> 23:16.824
That is how to cook a steak
like a true MasterChef.

23:16.824 --> 23:18.460
Aarón:
All right, guys,
you have 30 minutes

23:18.460 --> 23:20.498
to cook an incredible steak

23:20.498 --> 23:22.335
with a spectacular sauce.

23:22.335 --> 23:24.974
The two who cook
the best dishes

23:24.974 --> 23:28.882
will earn a spot
in the world's most difficult

23:28.882 --> 23:30.986
cooking competition out there.

23:30.986 --> 23:35.428
Your 30 minutes starts now!

23:35.428 --> 23:36.564
Come on, gentlemen.
Let's go.

23:39.870 --> 23:43.611
‐ Yo, man, game time.
‐ Let's do this.

23:43.611 --> 23:44.847
‐ So, Michael.
‐ Yes, Chef?

23:44.847 --> 23:46.183
What's the dish?

23:46.183 --> 23:47.586
It's basically me on a plate.

23:47.586 --> 23:48.855
My parents came from Thailand,

23:48.855 --> 23:52.195
so today I'm cooking
a Thai‐inspired ribeye

23:52.195 --> 23:57.205
and a vodka flambé‐infused
sweet potato purée.

23:57.205 --> 23:58.307
Wow.

24:01.814 --> 24:03.317
Daniel, describe the dish,
please.

24:03.317 --> 24:06.824
On this plate, Chef,
you're going to find me
in a nutshell.

24:06.824 --> 24:08.762
My parents, growing up
in Cabo Verde,

24:08.762 --> 24:11.066
you know, little island
off the west coast of Africa‐‐

24:11.066 --> 24:14.339
I'm taking a lot of those
flavors that I grew up eating.

24:14.339 --> 24:15.876
The roasted red pepper
as a garnish,

24:15.876 --> 24:17.178
the yucca that I'm frying.

24:17.178 --> 24:18.848
I am also a musician.

24:18.848 --> 24:20.284
I'm doing something
very similar

24:20.284 --> 24:22.021
to what I do
when I'm making music.

24:22.021 --> 24:23.056
I'm taking something raw,

24:23.056 --> 24:24.593
I'm adding my own spices
and some heat,

24:24.593 --> 24:26.898
and I'm bringing back
something that's delicious.

24:26.898 --> 24:28.802
Once you guys try it,
you'll agree.

24:28.802 --> 24:29.937
Aarón:
Dan, you gonna drop
a beat for us?

24:29.937 --> 24:32.876
After I take
that apron down I will.

24:32.876 --> 24:35.982
Guys, we're halfway.
15 minutes to go, okay?

24:35.982 --> 24:37.452
There we go.

24:37.452 --> 24:38.822
Brien,
describe the dish, please.

24:38.822 --> 24:41.594
This is the fillet O'Brien.

24:41.594 --> 24:43.263
Pan‐seared
filet mignon steak,

24:43.263 --> 24:44.967
Brussels sprouts
with a little garlic.

24:44.967 --> 24:46.938
Stop, stop, stop.
fillet O'Brien?

24:46.938 --> 24:48.407
My name is Brien O'Brien.

24:48.407 --> 24:49.577
You've named it
after yourself.

24:49.577 --> 24:51.681
I named it after myself.
This is my signature dish.

24:51.681 --> 24:53.751
So you've catapulted yourself

24:53.751 --> 24:55.287
with the great cooks
of the world?

24:55.287 --> 24:56.289
Absolutely.

24:56.289 --> 24:57.291
Julia Child,

24:57.291 --> 24:58.595
Auguste Escoffier.

24:58.595 --> 25:00.164
This is me on a plate.

25:00.164 --> 25:01.801
What separates you from
the competition tonight?

25:01.801 --> 25:05.709
My intelligence,
my knowledge of food,
and my passion.

25:05.709 --> 25:08.046
Five minutes to go.
Don't plate too early.

25:08.046 --> 25:10.217
Aakash, what are you making?

25:10.217 --> 25:14.459
So it's a masala ribeye
with a peppered
bourbon spicy sauce.

25:14.459 --> 25:16.229
I'm serving
that over a potato puree.

25:16.229 --> 25:18.400
I love doing
Indian fusion food.

25:18.400 --> 25:20.471
I lived there for ten years,
so I grew up with the people,

25:20.471 --> 25:22.643
the culture, the spices,
the flavors.

25:22.643 --> 25:24.780
So I'm just using those spices,
kind of infuse it through.

25:24.780 --> 25:28.253
Great. Thank you.
60 seconds remaining.

25:28.253 --> 25:29.489
Let's go, guys. Push it.

25:29.489 --> 25:31.594
Aaron:
Two spots. Let's go.
Who wants it more?

25:31.594 --> 25:33.263
‐ It's all mine.
‐ I got it.

25:33.263 --> 25:34.533
The thing with Aakash,

25:34.533 --> 25:36.671
he's about to whip
his potatoes in a blender,

25:36.671 --> 25:39.475
and that
has all the potential
of making cement.

25:39.475 --> 25:41.514
Gordon: Yes.

25:41.514 --> 25:43.116
‐ Oh.
‐ Yeah, no, no.

25:43.116 --> 25:44.820
Christina:
Don't touch it.

25:44.820 --> 25:47.024
The idea was flambéing
the steak, not the stove.

25:47.024 --> 25:49.162
‐ Or my hair.
‐ Or your hair.

25:49.162 --> 25:51.066
Gordon:
What about Brien O'Brien?

25:51.066 --> 25:53.638
He's put himself
up there with the titans
of our industry.

25:53.638 --> 25:56.577
His food better be as good.

25:56.577 --> 25:58.246
This is what
we came here for.
Let's do this.

25:58.246 --> 26:01.186
Judges:
Ten, nine, eight,

26:01.186 --> 26:04.860
seven, six, five, four,

26:04.860 --> 26:07.365
three, two, one,

26:07.365 --> 26:08.868
‐ and hands in the air.
‐ Hands in the air!

26:08.868 --> 26:11.607
‐ Great job.
‐ Whoo!

26:11.607 --> 26:13.845
‐ Yeah!
‐ All right, gentlemen,

26:13.845 --> 26:15.314
take your plates down
to the table, please.

26:16.517 --> 26:18.320
Christina: Thank you.

26:28.407 --> 26:29.977
Michael, describe
the dish please.

26:29.977 --> 26:33.417
It is a Northern
Thai‐influenced ribeye

26:33.417 --> 26:35.487
<i>with Brussels sprouts,</i>
<i>flambé sauce,</i>

26:35.487 --> 26:38.995
<i>lemongrass, kaffir lime,</i>
<i>and a sweet potato mash.</i>

26:38.995 --> 26:40.264
What's the purée?

26:40.264 --> 26:43.170
I took the vodka,
and I wanted to create a sauce

26:43.170 --> 26:46.209
that was folded in
to the sweet potato purée.

26:47.746 --> 26:49.950
The steak's beautiful.
Let's get that right.

26:49.950 --> 26:52.723
It's seasoned beautifully,
and it's caramelized
like a pro.

26:52.723 --> 26:55.929
I'm just confused to why
you'd fold in a sauce
in a sweet potato.

26:55.929 --> 26:57.733
You don't combine them.

26:57.733 --> 26:59.536
That's the reason
why the mash is so wet.

26:59.536 --> 27:01.439
However,
you've nailed the steak.

27:01.439 --> 27:04.045
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Thank you.

27:04.045 --> 27:06.349
Daniel,
talk to me a little bit
about that fillet.

27:06.349 --> 27:09.757
Daniel:
<i>It's a filet mignon</i>
<i>with fried yucca.</i>

27:09.757 --> 27:11.025
<i>The steak itself</i>
<i>was butter‐based.</i>

27:11.025 --> 27:12.094
<i>I used a little bit</i>
<i>of garlic,</i>

27:12.094 --> 27:13.998
<i>crushed red pepper,</i>
<i>some rosemary.</i>

27:13.998 --> 27:18.206
The sauce is a shallot,
garlic, and mushroom

27:18.206 --> 27:20.912
with a Port wine
flambé sauce.

27:20.912 --> 27:23.584
You put a fair amount
of black pepper,
which I enjoy.

27:23.584 --> 27:26.022
As far as cooking the fillet,
it's spot‐on.

27:26.022 --> 27:28.293
The yucca,
a little underdone.

27:28.293 --> 27:29.763
See that?

27:29.763 --> 27:32.268
But that garnish with
the mushrooms, the shallots,

27:32.268 --> 27:34.606
that makes sense to me.
That's an invitation to eat.

27:34.606 --> 27:35.975
Good job.

27:35.975 --> 27:38.113
All right, Brien,
what do we got?

27:38.113 --> 27:40.484
Brien:
<i>We got a pan‐seared</i>
<i>filet mignon.</i>

27:40.484 --> 27:42.254
<i>We have some</i>
<i>bacon Brussels sprouts</i>

27:42.254 --> 27:44.927
<i>and some garlic and chive</i>
<i>mashed potatoes.</i>

27:44.927 --> 27:46.496
Talk to me about
the flambé element.

27:46.496 --> 27:49.302
I made a Irish whiskey
with a little beef stock.

27:49.302 --> 27:50.738
So I just poured it
over the side,

27:50.738 --> 27:52.642
so it kinda got
into the Brussels sprouts
a little bit.

27:52.642 --> 27:54.312
I probably should have
added a little bit more

27:54.312 --> 27:56.416
now that I look at it.

27:56.416 --> 27:58.086
I wouldn't even know
that there was a sauce on it,

27:58.086 --> 28:00.992
but the steak is delicious,
the potatoes are delicious,

28:00.992 --> 28:02.294
the Brussels sprouts
are delicious.

28:02.294 --> 28:03.430
They're well‐roasted,
they're well‐seasoned.

28:03.430 --> 28:04.533
Thank you.

28:04.533 --> 28:05.802
The thing
that's missing for me

28:05.802 --> 28:08.073
is more of that rich,
luscious flambé sauce,

28:08.073 --> 28:09.610
but it's a pretty
good showing.

28:09.610 --> 28:10.812
Thank you, Chef.

28:14.218 --> 28:16.724
Okay, Aakash,
describe the dish please.

28:16.724 --> 28:19.262
Aakash:
<i>So it's a masala</i>
<i>spiced ribeye</i>

28:19.262 --> 28:22.636
<i>with a spicy pepper</i>
<i>bourbon sauce</i>
<i>over a potato purée</i>

28:22.636 --> 28:24.973
<i>topped with a arugula salad</i>
<i>with some bacon.</i>

28:24.973 --> 28:26.744
What temp
did you go for?

28:26.744 --> 28:28.313
‐ Medium rare?
‐ I was looking
for a medium rare.

28:28.313 --> 28:31.019
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ Let's find out.

28:31.019 --> 28:35.460
Yeah. You got a great
sear on that ribeye.

28:35.460 --> 28:36.931
So here's the thing.

28:36.931 --> 28:39.335
The steak's beautiful.
The sauce, delicious.

28:39.335 --> 28:42.509
But you did something really,
really awkward this evening

28:42.509 --> 28:44.613
when you made those mash
and you stuck it in a...

28:44.613 --> 28:46.550
‐ Blender.
‐ Why?

28:46.550 --> 28:47.986
Time was running down.

28:47.986 --> 28:50.190
I was focusing
more on the flavors
on the steak and the sauce.

28:50.190 --> 28:52.361
'Cause it comes out
like wallpaper paste.

28:52.361 --> 28:53.731
But good job.

28:53.731 --> 28:55.000
The problem tonight
is you're up against

28:55.000 --> 28:56.870
some tough,
tough competition.

28:56.870 --> 28:59.241
‐ Well done.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

29:01.814 --> 29:03.083
Guys, this is
gonna be tough.

29:03.083 --> 29:05.688
‐ There's four cooks.
‐ Gordon: And only two aprons.

29:05.688 --> 29:07.424
Yeah.

29:10.364 --> 29:13.938
This is a tough one,
because all four of you
raised the bar.

29:13.938 --> 29:16.109
Four of the most
incredible dishes
in this four‐way battle.

29:16.109 --> 29:17.979
Guys, I'm gonna get
straight to the point.

29:19.783 --> 29:21.620
Congratulations...

29:30.037 --> 29:32.575
Four of the most
incredible dishes
in this four‐way battle.

29:32.575 --> 29:35.982
This is a tough one,
because all four of you
raised the bar,

29:35.982 --> 29:40.490
but only two of you
are leaving with aprons.

29:40.490 --> 29:42.929
Guys, I'm going to get
straight to the point.

29:42.929 --> 29:43.998
Congratulations...

29:47.872 --> 29:51.012
‐ Yeah!
‐ Let's do this.

29:51.012 --> 29:52.782
Whoo!

29:58.026 --> 29:59.529
Whoo!

30:00.865 --> 30:03.069
‐ Yeah, baby!
‐ Yes!

30:06.209 --> 30:09.482
‐ Oh, I love you guys.
‐ Whoo!

30:09.482 --> 30:11.787
Yeah! My man!

30:11.787 --> 30:13.223
I will never forget this day.

30:13.223 --> 30:15.895
Except for the day where I found
out that I was having a baby,

30:15.895 --> 30:17.665
this is probably the best
I've ever felt.

30:17.665 --> 30:19.301
This is for you, Mom and Dad.

30:19.301 --> 30:21.072
Whoo! Victory!

30:21.072 --> 30:23.009
Oh, I love you.

30:23.009 --> 30:24.311
This is a dream come true.

30:24.311 --> 30:25.815
Oh, my God.

30:25.815 --> 30:27.351
<i>I'm so happy to be wearing</i>
<i>this apron right now.</i>

30:27.351 --> 30:30.323
‐ My man! Yes!
‐ This is just the first step.

30:30.323 --> 30:32.529
Next step,
the "MasterChef" trophy,

30:32.529 --> 30:33.864
<i>a quarter</i>
<i>of a million dollars,</i>

30:33.864 --> 30:35.768
and "MasterChef" winner.

30:42.615 --> 30:43.817
( sobbing )

30:43.817 --> 30:45.621
Announcer:
<i>In this season's battles,</i>

30:45.621 --> 30:47.124
<i>earning a coveted white apron</i>

30:47.124 --> 30:50.130
<i>has been more difficult</i>
<i>than ever before.</i>

30:50.130 --> 30:53.469
Don't give up.
Promise me you'll continue
that food dream.

30:53.469 --> 30:55.373
Absolutely.

30:55.373 --> 30:57.879
<i>But as the battles</i>
<i>near an end...</i>

30:57.879 --> 30:59.849
‐ Hello.

30:59.849 --> 31:02.054
‐ <i>those with the skill...</i>

31:04.826 --> 31:06.095

31:06.095 --> 31:07.932
Girl, say good‐bye.

31:07.932 --> 31:10.136
<i>savor the taste of victory.</i>

31:10.136 --> 31:11.873
Christina:
I'd order this on the menu
of a restaurant.

31:11.873 --> 31:13.042
Nice job.

31:13.042 --> 31:16.115
It's got that wow factor.
Incredible!

31:16.115 --> 31:19.488
This apron is gonna go
to one of you. Jeff.

31:19.488 --> 31:21.392
Congratulations, Eboni.

31:21.392 --> 31:23.396
<i>In all, 19 home cooks</i>

31:23.396 --> 31:25.333

‐ Yes! Yes!

31:27.404 --> 31:29.141
‐ Jennifer.
‐ ( laughs )

31:31.245 --> 31:33.651
<i>...leaving just one final spot</i>

31:33.651 --> 31:35.353
<i>in the MasterChef kitchen.</i>

31:35.353 --> 31:38.159
What up, people? Come on!

31:38.159 --> 31:40.865
Let's hear it over here.
Come on! Come on!

31:40.865 --> 31:44.171
<i>Our final battle</i>
<i>features Newton,</i>

31:44.171 --> 31:46.777
<i>a ranch owner</i>
<i>from the Lone Star State</i>

31:46.777 --> 31:48.279
<i>who hopes to trample</i>
<i>the competition</i>

31:48.279 --> 31:50.083
<i>with his big Texas flavors.</i>

31:50.083 --> 31:52.187
I hope they get me
a big old steak.

31:52.187 --> 31:56.195
I'm a native‐born Texas rancher.
I raise beef.

31:56.195 --> 31:58.634
These are first‐time heifers
and roping steers out here.

31:58.634 --> 31:59.969
<i>It's non‐stop,</i>

31:59.969 --> 32:01.740
<i>so, you know, you're busier</i>

32:01.740 --> 32:03.076
than a one‐legged man
in an ass‐kicking contest.

32:03.076 --> 32:04.813
There's not anything
they could throw at you

32:04.813 --> 32:05.981
that you can't handle.

32:05.981 --> 32:08.152
I'm a meat and potatoes guy.
Enjoy.

32:08.152 --> 32:09.355
<i>I have a passion for food.</i>

32:09.355 --> 32:11.526
You're gonna savor that spice.

32:11.526 --> 32:14.231
It's gonna have some nuances
to it that you don't expect.

32:14.231 --> 32:16.102
I don't know if you saw
my competitor over there,

32:16.102 --> 32:17.538
but he makes me
a little nervous.

32:17.538 --> 32:20.878
Dead. Dead to me.

32:20.878 --> 32:23.550
Announcer: <i>Competing</i>
<i>against Newton is Tom,</i>

32:23.550 --> 32:25.186
<i>a draftsman from Hawaii</i>

32:25.186 --> 32:26.857
<i>who's looking</i>
<i>to win a white apron</i>

32:26.857 --> 32:28.761
<i>with his Pacific Island flair.</i>

32:28.761 --> 32:30.564
I'm just ready to cook.

32:30.564 --> 32:32.467
The kitchen is where
I'm comfortable.

32:32.467 --> 32:35.608
<i>Being from Hawaii,</i>
<i>food, that's what life</i>
<i>revolves around.</i>

32:35.608 --> 32:37.377
I typically cook dinner
every night

32:37.377 --> 32:39.983
<i>for my wife and my daughter.</i>

32:39.983 --> 32:43.055
I love to grill.
I love anything with meat.

32:43.055 --> 32:44.726
If it doesn't have meat,
it's not a real meal.

32:44.726 --> 32:46.395
<i>I'm gonna show today</i>

32:46.395 --> 32:48.901

32:52.340 --> 32:54.344

but it's gonna be on me.

32:54.344 --> 32:56.081
Texas!

32:56.081 --> 32:58.486
‐ Come on, boy.
‐ Good luck, buddy.

33:02.628 --> 33:05.568
Welcome, guys.
Come on down, please.

33:05.568 --> 33:07.705
Tom: <i>Newton,</i>
<i>beef's probably his game.</i>

33:07.705 --> 33:09.609
Really hoping
he's a one‐trick pony.

33:09.609 --> 33:10.978
<i>You know, I think</i>
<i>in the kitchen</i>

33:10.978 --> 33:12.815
<i>I've got a big advantage</i>
<i>over him.</i>

33:12.815 --> 33:14.117
Gordon:
Good to see you both.

33:14.117 --> 33:16.255
I'm ready.
I mean, I can cook anything.

33:16.255 --> 33:18.627
<i>Fried chicken,</i>
<i>pork, or beef‐‐</i>

33:18.627 --> 33:20.163
<i>I have no idea</i>
<i>what we're making.</i>

33:20.163 --> 33:21.900
I'd love for it
to be a steak.

33:21.900 --> 33:22.969
Make it a steak, please.

33:22.969 --> 33:25.473
Newton and Tom.

33:25.473 --> 33:27.612
Now, a real MasterChef
needs to know

33:27.612 --> 33:30.416
how to chop,
how to cut, how to butcher.

33:34.659 --> 33:37.798
And also needs
to know how to...

33:42.007 --> 33:45.614
‐ Oh!
‐ ...bake.

33:45.614 --> 33:46.816
Oh, Lord.

33:46.816 --> 33:49.388
In your battle,
you're gonna have to show us

33:49.388 --> 33:53.997
that you can bake cupcakes
worthy of that white apron.

33:53.997 --> 33:56.803
‐ Awesome. All right.
‐ You have just 50 minutes

33:56.803 --> 34:00.644
to bake us the best cupcakes
of your entire lives.

34:00.644 --> 34:01.713
You both ready?

34:01.713 --> 34:02.848
‐ Ready.
‐ Born.

34:02.848 --> 34:06.255
All right,
your 50 minutes starts...

34:06.255 --> 34:08.092
‐ Good luck.
‐ ...now!

34:14.772 --> 34:16.710
All right, Newton,
what's the cupcake?

34:16.710 --> 34:19.047
It's gonna be
a coffee‐flavored
chocolate cupcake

34:19.047 --> 34:21.786
with a chocolate frosting,
served with a praline pecan

34:21.786 --> 34:23.022
with a little
chipotle seasoning.

34:23.022 --> 34:25.126
And we're gonna top it off
with chocolate chips.

34:25.126 --> 34:28.299
Basically, it's gonna be
a little cupcake just like me.

34:28.299 --> 34:31.171
‐ Easy on the eyes.
‐ All right.

34:31.171 --> 34:32.808
Tom, what about you?

34:32.808 --> 34:34.411
We're doing
a chocolate cupcake,

34:34.411 --> 34:37.652
vanilla cream filling,
vanilla butter cream frosting,

34:37.652 --> 34:39.689
homemade caramel
to drizzle on top,

34:39.689 --> 34:42.895
and we got some
candied macadamia nuts
on top of that.

34:42.895 --> 34:46.268
Growing up in Hawaii,
we don't get a mouthful
of just one thing.

34:46.268 --> 34:47.905
You're gonna
get layers of flavor.

34:47.905 --> 34:50.443
It's all gonna come across
in one perfect bite.

34:50.443 --> 34:51.445
All right.

34:51.445 --> 34:53.850
Gordon:
25 minutes remaining.

35:01.566 --> 35:03.804
Both of these guys are
making chocolate cupcakes,

35:03.804 --> 35:05.974
but I do think there's
such a thing as overkill.

35:05.974 --> 35:08.714
Yeah, like,
dessert should be like
a good kiss good night.

35:08.714 --> 35:10.316
Straightforward
and to the point.

35:10.316 --> 35:12.922
‐ A good kiss goodnight?
‐ Yeah.

35:15.994 --> 35:19.101
Newton, 53,
what do you do for a career?

35:19.101 --> 35:21.840
Back in December of last year,
I had a stroke,

35:21.840 --> 35:23.610
and at that point,
I had a second chance at life.

35:23.610 --> 35:25.547
So I took the bull
by the horns,

35:25.547 --> 35:27.585
made the decision to go
to ranching full‐time,

35:27.585 --> 35:30.456
and I'm so fortunate
to have the wife that I do

35:30.456 --> 35:31.726
that allowed me to do that.

35:31.726 --> 35:33.964
I'm a blessed man.

35:33.964 --> 35:36.201
I win or I lose,
this is a hell of a journey.

35:36.201 --> 35:40.276
Right.
Ten minutes to go.

35:40.276 --> 35:42.046
Now those cupcakes
should be coming out.

35:45.453 --> 35:48.159
Aarón:
Tom, talk to me a little bit
about your love for cooking.

35:48.159 --> 35:49.996
Oh, food's my passion.

35:49.996 --> 35:52.133
When I was younger,
I used to be a butcher,

35:52.133 --> 35:54.137
and, uh, it just
didn't pay the bills.

35:54.137 --> 35:57.010
I had a family early,
so I ended up in construction

35:57.010 --> 35:58.680
just 'cause it paid
a little better.

35:58.680 --> 36:02.253
So, for me, this is really
my chance to do what I love.

36:02.253 --> 36:03.189
I really wanna take
advantage of it.

36:03.189 --> 36:06.596
Gentlemen,
five minutes remain.

36:10.203 --> 36:13.209
Here goes Tom.
He's going in with that
super‐thin piping tip

36:13.209 --> 36:15.981
to get some of that
vanilla cream frosting
in the center.

36:15.981 --> 36:17.785
Gordon: Wow.

36:17.785 --> 36:20.456
Start visualizing
the finishing touches.

36:20.456 --> 36:23.797
Christina:
We want three beautifully
frosted cupcakes.

36:23.797 --> 36:25.901
30 seconds away from entering

36:25.901 --> 36:28.640
the biggest
cooking competition
in the world.

36:28.640 --> 36:29.642
Aarón:
Push, gentlemen.

36:29.642 --> 36:33.115
‐ Let's go.
‐ Come on.

36:33.115 --> 36:36.756
Judges:
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

36:36.756 --> 36:40.831
six, five, four, three,

36:40.831 --> 36:43.803
‐ two, one, and stop.
‐ Hands in the air.

36:49.281 --> 36:53.188
Newton and Tom,
we're looking for three
incredible cupcakes.

36:53.188 --> 36:55.293
This is for the final place

36:55.293 --> 36:58.299
in the biggest cooking
competition on the planet.

37:01.471 --> 37:02.942
Newton,
describe the cupcake.

37:02.942 --> 37:05.914
Newton:
<i>It's an espresso‐flavored</i>
<i>chocolate cupcake,</i>

37:05.914 --> 37:07.751
<i>chocolate</i>
<i>butter cream frosting,</i>

37:07.751 --> 37:10.757
<i>chocolate chips,</i>
<i>and chipotle bourbon pecans.</i>

37:10.757 --> 37:12.594
I wanted to kind of
represent Texas.

37:12.594 --> 37:15.266
We start our day off with
a good, strong cup of coffee.

37:15.266 --> 37:16.936
We end it with
a little bit of bourbon.

37:16.936 --> 37:20.644
Well, I gotta say,
I'm totally shocked.

37:20.644 --> 37:22.815
They're beautiful,
they're glistening.

37:22.815 --> 37:24.484
It's definitely not dry.

37:27.791 --> 37:28.893
It's delicious.

37:28.893 --> 37:31.532
I think the way that you
played with the espresso

37:31.532 --> 37:33.903
and that spice
in the frosting was smart.

37:33.903 --> 37:38.012
I love the pecans on top.
What would I change?

37:38.012 --> 37:40.517
A little bit more flour
and a little bit
more baking powder

37:40.517 --> 37:43.022
to give your cupcakes
a little bit more
of that puffy top.

37:43.022 --> 37:45.861
But flavor‐wise? Spot on.

37:45.861 --> 37:48.332
‐ Thank you.
‐ Good job, man.

37:55.847 --> 37:59.187
That is ( bleep ) delicious.

37:59.187 --> 38:01.458
I mean, seriously.
Uh, here's the weird thing.

38:01.458 --> 38:03.228
I would prefer to see it
a little bit lighter
in the batter,

38:03.228 --> 38:05.634
because it's super rich,
but it's indulgent.

38:05.634 --> 38:07.905
I mean, if that's what
you can do with a cupcake,

38:07.905 --> 38:09.975
( bleep ) knows what you
can do with a piece of steak.

38:09.975 --> 38:11.813
‐ Great job.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

38:12.848 --> 38:13.850
Amazing.

38:13.850 --> 38:15.486
Very good.

38:15.486 --> 38:19.728
So, Tom, tell me
about these cupcakes.

38:19.728 --> 38:21.866
Tom:
<i>These are a chocolate cake.</i>

38:21.866 --> 38:24.605
<i>It's got a vanilla</i>
<i>whipped cream in the center,</i>

38:24.605 --> 38:26.909
<i>vanilla butter cream</i>
<i>frosting on top,</i>

38:26.909 --> 38:28.345
<i>a homemade caramel drizzle</i>

38:28.345 --> 38:30.517
<i>with candied macadamia nuts</i>
<i>on top of that.</i>

38:30.517 --> 38:33.623
For me, I really
was just trying to think of

38:33.623 --> 38:36.094
if I could have
that perfect bite,

38:36.094 --> 38:37.430
what would I wanna
taste in it?

38:37.430 --> 38:39.367
My favorite things
in the world

38:39.367 --> 38:40.737
were chocolate and caramel.

38:40.737 --> 38:42.206
Boom.

38:48.118 --> 38:50.289
Tastes a little bit
like an ice cream sundae.

38:50.289 --> 38:52.126
Love the cream filling.

38:52.126 --> 38:55.634
The vanilla butter cream
frosting on top
is beautifully piped.

38:55.634 --> 38:58.138
I think that your cupcake
is a minute,

38:58.138 --> 39:00.409
a minute and a half
over‐baked down here,

39:00.409 --> 39:03.015
but that vanilla cream center
really helped provide

39:03.015 --> 39:04.552
a little bit more moisture
in the center

39:04.552 --> 39:05.554
where it would have normally
been a little bit dry.

39:05.554 --> 39:08.593
‐ Nice job.
‐ Thank you.

39:08.593 --> 39:12.433
And what was
the thought process behind
the cream‐filled center?

39:12.433 --> 39:14.270
It would add
some moisture to the cake.

39:14.270 --> 39:17.276
It would also help
so it wasn't quite as sweet.

39:17.276 --> 39:19.715
I didn't see the need
for the cream,
to be very honest.

39:19.715 --> 39:22.220
It's a scant amount of it.

39:22.220 --> 39:24.290
For me, the true star
is the garnish.

39:24.290 --> 39:27.296
That caramel has
a beautiful nuttiness.

39:27.296 --> 39:30.436
The texture from
the macadamia nuts‐‐
that I really love.

39:30.436 --> 39:32.440
‐ Awesome.
‐ Thank you.

39:37.483 --> 39:39.420
Right to the wire.

39:39.420 --> 39:41.324
Did you see that?
Right to the wire.

39:41.324 --> 39:42.594
Aarón:
He nailed it.

39:46.434 --> 39:47.604
Gentlemen.

39:49.474 --> 39:52.480
Two beautiful batches
of cupcakes.

39:54.450 --> 39:57.624
This was the closest battle
we've had yet.

39:57.624 --> 40:02.033
This last apron
represents the last place

40:02.033 --> 40:03.870
in the MasterChef kitchen.

40:05.306 --> 40:07.544
This apron belongs to...

40:15.927 --> 40:19.167
Cowboy! Cowboy! Cowboy!

40:22.908 --> 40:25.212
( cheering )

40:34.130 --> 40:36.134
You know, I'm disappointed
to not get an apron,

40:36.134 --> 40:38.372
<i>but I'm going home proud.</i>

40:38.372 --> 40:40.309
I lost to a guy
that made a great cupcake.

40:40.309 --> 40:42.914
He's not just a rancher.
He did a terrific job.

40:42.914 --> 40:45.754
I'm just so proud of you.

40:45.754 --> 40:47.824
I mean, there's a lot
of sacrificing here.

40:47.824 --> 40:51.966
Not for me. For my family.

40:54.170 --> 40:55.472
<i>Some people don't get</i>
<i>a second chance,</i>

40:55.472 --> 40:56.575
and I'm not gonna waste it.

40:56.575 --> 41:00.182
( cheering )

41:04.290 --> 41:06.027
Announcer:
<i>Next week...</i>

41:06.027 --> 41:07.229
Aarón:
America's next MasterChef

41:07.229 --> 41:09.868
is standing
in front of us right now.

41:09.868 --> 41:11.371
This is pretty terrifying.

41:11.371 --> 41:14.210
<i>the top 20 take on their first</i>
<i>mystery box challenge.</i>

41:14.210 --> 41:15.613
Gordon:
A grocery bag.

41:15.613 --> 41:17.082
Christina: You couldn't
level the playing field

41:17.082 --> 41:19.320
any more
than we have tonight.

41:19.320 --> 41:20.790
<i>They've won their aprons.</i>

41:20.790 --> 41:22.460
‐ Why kebab?
‐ <i>Now they fight...</i>

41:22.460 --> 41:23.930
Heather, just do
what I do and ignore them.

41:23.930 --> 41:25.499
<i>...to keep them.</i>

41:25.499 --> 41:27.136
Is this a joke for you?

41:27.136 --> 41:30.108
Take it serious
or take your apron off.
