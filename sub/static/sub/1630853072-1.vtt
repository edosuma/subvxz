00:19.400 --> 00:21.080
(cooing)

00:38.200 --> 00:40.000
(humming)

00:43.440 --> 00:45.280
(laughing)

00:45.320 --> 00:47.600
- Hmm. Oh. Oh!

00:55.800 --> 00:57.480
- Boop.
(chuckling)

00:57.520 --> 00:59.480
(laughing softly)
- Boop.

00:59.520 --> 01:01.800
(laughter)
- Hmm.

01:03.440 --> 01:08.160
- Oh! I want to be a doctor
and travel here and there,

01:08.200 --> 01:11.440
listening to people's chests
and giving them my care.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.480
- Huh?

01:13.520 --> 01:17.360
Hmm.
(girl gasping softly)

01:17.400 --> 01:22.480
- We doctors must help everyone who needs
us. It's our duty.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.400
- Hmm.

01:25.440 --> 01:28.440
Your duty is to wear the crown,

01:28.480 --> 01:31.320
and be a royal beauty.

01:31.360 --> 01:34.160
(chuckling)
(grunting)

01:35.800 --> 01:37.360
Oh.
(laughing)

01:37.400 --> 01:39.200
(bell tolling)

01:42.960 --> 01:45.000
(lively music)
(laughing)

01:48.600 --> 01:50.400
(whooping)

01:56.600 --> 01:59.000
(narrator): Meet the flying doctors.

01:59.039 --> 02:01.880
A dragon, knight and girl.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.560
(exclamations)

02:17.520 --> 02:20.000
(laughing)
- Our names are...

02:20.040 --> 02:22.400
- Gadabout the Great.

02:22.440 --> 02:24.120
- And Zog.

02:24.160 --> 02:26.160
- And Princess Pearl.

02:29.640 --> 02:31.400
(sneezing)

02:31.440 --> 02:33.320
(grunting softly)

02:35.400 --> 02:36.960
(humming)

02:37.000 --> 02:40.960
(narrator): Pearl gives people medicine
and pills and vaccinations.

02:44.400 --> 02:47.800
And Gadabout is expert
at performing operations.

02:58.480 --> 03:00.080
- Whoo!

03:00.120 --> 03:02.720
(narrator): Zog is good at flying.
- Whoo-hoo!

03:05.000 --> 03:07.520
(exclaiming, then sighing)

03:07.560 --> 03:09.840
(exclaiming)

03:09.880 --> 03:13.280
- Hmm.
(exclaiming, then grunting)

03:14.640 --> 03:17.960
(narrator): They're not quite so good at landing.
- Hmm?

03:19.200 --> 03:23.680
(narrator): But Gadabout and Princess Pearl
are always understanding.

03:24.720 --> 03:26.480
(growling)

03:30.800 --> 03:34.360
Flying high one morning,
they heard a mermaid wail.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.880
(wailing)

03:35.920 --> 03:37.680
- Oh!
- Hmm?

03:37.720 --> 03:41.640
- I'm sunburned! And it hurts!

03:41.680 --> 03:45.200
(narrator): She cried,
and swished her scaly tail.

03:45.240 --> 03:47.720
(mermaid sobbing)

03:47.760 --> 03:50.240
- Oh. Mm-hmm.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.160
(mermaid crying)

03:54.200 --> 03:57.360
(squawking)
(narrator): Bang, crash, thump!

03:57.400 --> 04:00.200
They landed.
(mermaid wailing)

04:00.240 --> 04:01.960
(Gadabout screaming)

04:02.000 --> 04:04.080
- Oh!
- Ow!

04:08.160 --> 04:09.600
Whoop.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.160
(sighing)

04:12.720 --> 04:14.240
- Ah!
(splashing)

04:14.280 --> 04:15.720
- Hmm?

04:17.959 --> 04:20.680
(crying)
(narrator): The mermaid's skin was red.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.720
(mermaid whimpering)
- Oh...

04:27.600 --> 04:30.360
(narrator): Pearl rubbed in some special cream.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.760
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

04:36.320 --> 04:38.280
(laughter)

04:38.320 --> 04:40.600
- And wear this hat.
(narrator): She said.

04:40.640 --> 04:42.640
- Ugh.
- Oh.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.960
Um...
(chuckling)

04:46.000 --> 04:47.600
- Hmm.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.400
(snail panting)

04:51.000 --> 04:53.120
(exclaiming)

04:53.159 --> 04:54.640
- Hmm.

04:55.960 --> 04:57.400
(crying out)

04:58.159 --> 05:00.240
- Ah!

05:05.400 --> 05:08.600
(grumbling)
- Thank you, Dr. Princess Pearl.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.960
(narrator): The mermaid waved goodbye

05:11.000 --> 05:15.480
as the team of flying doctors sped away
into the sky.

05:20.200 --> 05:23.160
As the sun rose higher,

05:23.200 --> 05:25.160
they saw a unicorn.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.920
He pawed the ground and whinnied.
(whinnying)

05:31.400 --> 05:35.280
- I've grown an extra horn!
(chirping)

05:35.320 --> 05:36.960
- Oh. Mm-hmm.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.880
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

05:38.920 --> 05:40.760
- Ow! Ow! Ah!

05:40.800 --> 05:43.200
(thumping)
(exclamations)

05:43.240 --> 05:45.600
(narrator): Bang, crash, thump, they landed.

05:47.360 --> 05:50.120
(groaning, then sighing)
- Hmm?

05:50.159 --> 05:52.040
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

05:53.159 --> 05:55.200
- Ah!
(panting)

05:55.240 --> 05:57.000
- Hmm. Ah!

05:59.000 --> 06:00.800
(grunting)

06:04.320 --> 06:06.480
- Huh.
- Huh?

06:06.520 --> 06:08.600
(unicorn laughing)

06:09.880 --> 06:12.240
- Hmm.
(crashing)

06:12.280 --> 06:15.720
Hmm?
(groaning)

06:15.760 --> 06:18.800
- Ah... I'll help you.
(narrator): Said the knight.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.080
(grunting)
(whimpering)

06:24.360 --> 06:26.720
(unicorn groaning)

06:26.760 --> 06:30.680
(narrator): And he cut the horn off gently,
to the unicorn's delight.

06:30.720 --> 06:34.080
(unicorn laughing)
- Thank you, bold Sir Gadabout,

06:34.120 --> 06:37.720
for taking so much care.
(Gadabout laughing)

06:39.080 --> 06:40.960
- Ah...
- Hmm.

06:43.800 --> 06:48.520
(narrator): And the team of flying doctors
sped away into the air.

06:51.720 --> 06:55.800
Halfway through the afternoon,
they heard a lion sneeze.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.440
(lion sneezing)

07:00.200 --> 07:01.960
(lion groaning)
(squirrel squeaking)

07:02.000 --> 07:04.640
- I've caught the flu!

07:04.680 --> 07:06.440
(narrator): The lion roared.

07:06.480 --> 07:10.800
- Can someone help me, please?
(thumping and exclamations)

07:10.840 --> 07:14.640
(narrator): Bang, crash, thump, they landed.
(lion growling)

07:16.520 --> 07:19.720
(grunting)
- Huh.

07:19.760 --> 07:21.280
Um...

07:22.680 --> 07:24.320
(squeaking)

07:24.360 --> 07:25.960
(growling softly)
Uh... hmm.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.360
Aw.
(lion sighing)

07:31.400 --> 07:33.200
(Pearl laughing softly)

07:34.240 --> 07:37.280
- Ah...
- Oh.

07:37.320 --> 07:39.360
Mm-hmm.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.680
Hmm.

07:43.720 --> 07:46.200
(narrator): Then Pearl said:
- Take this pill.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.760
And do keep warm.

07:51.800 --> 07:54.640
That's terribly important when you're ill.

07:54.680 --> 07:56.720
(lion shivering)

08:00.800 --> 08:03.200
(narrator): But the lion's cave was chilly.

08:04.200 --> 08:05.760
So Zog said:

08:05.800 --> 08:09.440
- Oh. Fetch some wood.
- Huh?

08:09.480 --> 08:11.240
- Mm...

08:11.280 --> 08:13.360
(Gadabout grumbling)

08:16.480 --> 08:19.840
(narrator): Then he breathed out lots of flames,

08:19.880 --> 08:23.280
until the fire burned bright and good.

08:23.320 --> 08:25.280
- Thank you, noble dragon.

08:25.320 --> 08:27.880
I'm feeling nice and warm.

08:27.920 --> 08:30.280
- Ah. Hmm.

08:30.320 --> 08:31.840
- Ah!
- Oh.

08:32.720 --> 08:37.679
(narrator): Then the team of flying doctors
sped away into the storm.

08:37.720 --> 08:39.720
(thunder rumbling)

08:49.840 --> 08:51.520
- Ah!

08:56.080 --> 08:58.160
(exclamations)

09:00.880 --> 09:02.600
(screaming)

09:03.840 --> 09:06.360
(narrator): As evening fell,

09:06.400 --> 09:09.280
they saw a great, big palace down below.

09:09.320 --> 09:13.160
- My uncle's house.
(narrator): Said Princess Pearl.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.480
(Gadabout shivering)
(Zog panting)

09:16.840 --> 09:18.840
- Let's go and say hello.

09:19.840 --> 09:21.160
- Ah!!

09:23.280 --> 09:25.520
(panting)
(exclamation)

09:25.560 --> 09:29.360
(narrator): Bang, crash, thump, they landed.
(exclamations)

09:31.600 --> 09:33.560
- Huh? Oh!

09:35.840 --> 09:38.240
(alarmed cooing)
Oh!

09:39.280 --> 09:41.840
- Pearl's uncle is the king!

09:41.880 --> 09:43.680
- Tsk.
(sighing)

09:43.720 --> 09:46.680
(narrator): He didn't say hello. Instead...

09:46.720 --> 09:50.200
he said:
- You naughty thing!

09:52.200 --> 09:54.720
Where have you been?!
(narrator): He thundered.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.480
- You look an awful mess.

09:56.520 --> 10:00.240
What's happened to your crown?!
And where's your pretty, frilly dress?

10:00.280 --> 10:01.760
(growling)
- Hmm?

10:03.320 --> 10:07.920
(laughing)
- But, Uncle, can't you see that I'm a doctor
now?

10:07.960 --> 10:12.680
(narrator): Said Pearl. The king replied:
- Princesses can't be doctors,

10:12.720 --> 10:14.200
silly girl.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.320
(Pearl laughing)

10:16.360 --> 10:20.080
- Huh?
- Seize her! Don't let go of her.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.200
Now, lock her up inside.
(Pearl exclaiming)

10:23.240 --> 10:24.840
(gasping)

10:24.880 --> 10:27.840
(exclaiming and roaring)

10:33.480 --> 10:34.920
- Ah! Oh.

10:38.600 --> 10:41.440
Let me go!
(narrator): Called Princess Pearl.

10:41.480 --> 10:44.960
She stamped and stormed and cried.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.440
(birdsong)
Time went by...

10:59.400 --> 11:04.000
...and Princess Pearl spent many weary hours
sewing pretty cushions

11:04.040 --> 11:06.680
and arranging pretty flowers.

11:06.720 --> 11:08.560
(sighing)

11:08.600 --> 11:10.280
- Ahem.
- Huh?

11:23.200 --> 11:25.000
(humming)

11:25.800 --> 11:27.440
- Hmm.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.640
(chortling and mumbling)

11:36.680 --> 11:38.560
(dove cooing)
Hmm?

11:42.080 --> 11:43.680
Mm.

11:43.720 --> 11:45.160
(cooing)

11:46.080 --> 11:47.720
(groaning)

11:53.560 --> 11:56.080
- Hmm. Oh!
(exclaiming)

12:03.600 --> 12:05.480
(screaming)
(sighing)

12:06.800 --> 12:08.560
(croaking)

12:13.480 --> 12:15.640
- Oh.
(gasping)

12:26.840 --> 12:28.760
Hmm.

12:38.480 --> 12:40.240
- Ah.

12:40.280 --> 12:41.880
(croaking)

12:44.000 --> 12:45.600
(laughing)

12:47.720 --> 12:49.520
(groaning)

12:49.560 --> 12:51.040
- Oh!

12:52.680 --> 12:54.760
(grunting)

12:54.800 --> 12:57.680
- Huh? Oh!

12:57.720 --> 12:59.320
(groaning)

13:00.480 --> 13:02.320
- Ahem.
(gasping)

13:02.360 --> 13:03.880
Hmm.

13:05.960 --> 13:08.840
(meowing, then sneezing)

13:08.880 --> 13:11.040
Hmm.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.960
(woman laughing)

13:22.000 --> 13:23.760
- Huh?

13:23.800 --> 13:25.040
(gasping)

13:27.200 --> 13:28.760
Hmm.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.320
Oh?

13:35.720 --> 13:38.920
(narrator): The others tried to rescue her
with all their might and main.

13:38.960 --> 13:41.480
(yapping)
- Oh!

13:43.200 --> 13:45.400
- Oh. Ah!!

13:45.440 --> 13:50.040
(narrator): But they simply couldn't manage.
All their efforts were in vain.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.560
(sighing)

13:56.600 --> 13:58.840
(birdsong)
(sighing)

14:00.080 --> 14:01.680
(meowing)

14:04.000 --> 14:06.040
(meowing and purring)
- Huh?

14:07.200 --> 14:09.040
(laughing)

14:09.080 --> 14:11.840
(meowing)
- Aw. Hmm.

14:14.160 --> 14:15.800
(gasping)

14:22.600 --> 14:24.200
Hmm.

14:35.800 --> 14:38.440
(moaning)
Oh!

14:38.480 --> 14:40.600
(moaning)

14:41.960 --> 14:43.560
Hmm.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.200
(moaning and mumbling)

14:49.280 --> 14:50.880
(groaning)

14:56.600 --> 14:58.760
- Oh...

14:58.800 --> 15:00.520
(groaning)

15:37.640 --> 15:39.240
- Hmm.

15:42.320 --> 15:46.120
(narrator): Each night, they flew to visit her...
(laughter)

15:46.160 --> 15:48.400
...and perched upon her sill.

15:48.440 --> 15:51.280
And one dark night, she told them that:

15:51.320 --> 15:53.840
- The king has fallen ill.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.400
- Oh.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.000
(narrator): The king grew worse.
(king groaning)

16:02.080 --> 16:03.960
- My head is sore,

16:04.000 --> 16:06.680
my arms and legs feel weak.

16:06.720 --> 16:12.000
(narrator): His skin had turned bright orange,
and he found it hard to speak.

16:12.040 --> 16:15.560
(groaning)
He called a lot of doctors.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.000
A new one every day.

16:18.040 --> 16:21.760
He croaked:
- What is this illness?

16:21.800 --> 16:25.400
(narrator): But they simply couldn't say.
(inquisitive murmuring)

16:29.800 --> 16:31.520
(cooing)

16:33.760 --> 16:35.360
(sneezing)

16:43.200 --> 16:45.160
They didn't know the answer.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.720
- Oh!

16:46.760 --> 16:48.720
(narrator): But Pearl was pretty sure.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.640
- Oh!

16:57.000 --> 17:01.560
Ah! It looks like orange fever.
And I think I've found the cure!

17:01.600 --> 17:04.640
(both): Hmm.
- Grated horn of unicorn,

17:04.680 --> 17:06.720
a mighty lion's sneeze,

17:06.760 --> 17:09.359
some mermaid scales, a little slime.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.720
- And half pound of cheese?

17:11.760 --> 17:14.960
- Do your best to find them all,
and do be very quick.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.680
My uncle could be dying.
He looks extremely sick.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.280
(both): Oh. Mm-hmm.

17:23.319 --> 17:27.760
(narrator): Away flew Zog and Gadabout.
(panting)

17:27.800 --> 17:29.720
They reached the lion's den.

17:29.760 --> 17:32.080
- Ah.
(crashing and exclamations)

17:32.120 --> 17:35.400
(laughing)
(narrator): Bang, crash, thump, they landed.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.120
He sneezed for them.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.720
- Argh!
(laughing)

17:42.760 --> 17:44.560
(narrator): And then they flew back

17:44.600 --> 17:46.200
to the forest.
(exclamations)

17:46.240 --> 17:51.360
Where the grateful unicorn was very pleased
to give them his unwanted, sawn-off horn.

17:51.400 --> 17:52.960
(laughing)
(whinnying)

17:53.000 --> 17:54.480
- Hmm.

17:55.320 --> 17:58.320
(narrator): Back to the mermaid's rock they flew.

17:59.080 --> 18:00.800
(crashing)
(screaming)

18:02.800 --> 18:06.680
(chuckling)
She gladly gave some scales.

18:08.280 --> 18:13.320
And her sea-snail friends allowed them
to collect their slimy trails.

18:14.360 --> 18:15.800
- Oh.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.440
(panting)

18:22.640 --> 18:24.520
(groaning)

18:24.560 --> 18:27.200
(narrator): Zog said:
- I'm exhausted.

18:27.240 --> 18:30.240
(sighing)
(both): Hmm.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.920
(narrator): But he flew and flew until...

18:33.800 --> 18:38.440
Bang, crash, thump,
they landed on the bedroom window sill.

18:38.480 --> 18:40.960
- Hmm?
(narrator): Princess Pearl said:

18:41.000 --> 18:43.800
- Thank you for the slime, scales,
horn and sneeze.

18:45.240 --> 18:47.320
Hmm. Oh.

18:48.240 --> 18:50.680
(narrator): She took it all and mixed it up...

18:52.600 --> 18:55.360
...with half a pound of cheese.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.120
- Hmm.
(sizzling)

19:01.760 --> 19:03.720
Ha!
(giggling)

19:04.680 --> 19:06.240
(laughing)

19:06.280 --> 19:07.760
- Oh!

19:10.720 --> 19:12.600
- Hmm.
- Ah!

19:12.640 --> 19:14.960
(cheering)

19:16.000 --> 19:18.560
- Ah.
(crashing)

19:21.040 --> 19:22.800
(groaning)
- Hmm.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.840
(screaming)

19:36.840 --> 19:40.120
- Yah!
(exclamations)

19:40.160 --> 19:42.480
(king moaning)

19:44.520 --> 19:48.080
(narrator): She tiptoed to her uncle's room.
(king moaning)

19:48.120 --> 19:50.200
The king lay in his bed.

19:55.040 --> 19:58.360
- Hmm.
- Huh? Oh!

19:58.400 --> 20:00.360
(groaning)
You...

20:03.080 --> 20:05.960
(narrator): She held a spoonful to his mouth.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.160
- Now open wide.
(narrator): She said.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.440
(grumbling)

20:12.920 --> 20:15.760
(guards shouting and grunting)

20:21.360 --> 20:23.440
- Huh?
(coughing)

20:27.640 --> 20:30.040
(both chuckling)
(exclamations)

20:45.760 --> 20:47.440
(grumbling)

20:55.000 --> 20:56.480
- Oh.

20:57.680 --> 20:59.280
- Huh?

21:00.520 --> 21:02.000
- Hmm.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.000
Boop.
(giggling)

21:05.040 --> 21:07.040
- Huh?
(laughing)

21:08.400 --> 21:10.600
(groaning)

21:19.880 --> 21:21.480
- Oh.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.480
(grumbling)
Ah.

21:23.520 --> 21:25.120
(giggling)

21:27.280 --> 21:28.960
(gulping)

21:29.000 --> 21:30.640
Oh?

21:30.680 --> 21:36.080
(narrator): After just one spoonful,
her uncle felt much stronger.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.640
(chuckling)

21:40.000 --> 21:43.360
And after spoonful two,
he wasn't orange any longer.

21:44.080 --> 21:46.400
- Oh!
(laughing)

21:46.440 --> 21:49.880
(narrator): After spoonful three,
the king was dancing with delight!

21:49.920 --> 21:51.880
(singing and laughing)

21:51.920 --> 21:54.160
- Ooh. Ooh!
(cracking)

21:54.200 --> 21:57.840
(laughing)
Princesses can be doctors!

21:57.880 --> 22:00.520
You were absolutely right.

22:00.560 --> 22:04.880
I'm sorry that I locked you up.
Of course, you must go free.

22:14.800 --> 22:17.160
But do come back to visit me.

22:17.200 --> 22:21.120
And bring your friends to tea.
(sounds of struggle)

22:24.000 --> 22:25.720
(growling)

22:25.760 --> 22:27.400
- Oh.

22:27.440 --> 22:29.040
Argh.

22:29.720 --> 22:31.320
- Ah.
(chuckling)

22:31.360 --> 22:32.960
Ahem!

22:36.000 --> 22:37.840
(Pearl laughing)
- Hurray!

22:37.880 --> 22:39.760
(narrator): Cried Pearl.
(laughter)

22:39.800 --> 22:44.240
And out she ran to join the other two.
(all chuckling)

22:46.320 --> 22:48.000
(crying)

22:51.800 --> 22:53.840
- Uh...

22:53.880 --> 22:55.880
(Pearl laughing)
Huh?

22:56.800 --> 22:59.120
(laughter)
Mm...

23:01.520 --> 23:04.360
(chuckling)
(yapping)

23:06.600 --> 23:10.280
(roaring)
(whimpering)

23:11.800 --> 23:14.120
- Aw.
(grunting)

23:25.320 --> 23:27.880
(narrator): Then off into the sunset...

23:28.840 --> 23:31.160
...sped the flying-doctor crew.

23:31.200 --> 23:33.800
(laughter)
- Hoo-hoo-hoo!

23:35.800 --> 23:38.520
(laughter)
(whooping)

23:44.480 --> 23:46.360
(music)

25:03.680 --> 25:05.880
Subtitling: difuze
