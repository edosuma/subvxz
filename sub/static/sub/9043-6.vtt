YOU CAN ALWAYS CALL ROBERT.

00:28.900 --> 00:32.467

00:32.467 --> 00:35.400

FROM PENNSYLVANIA

00:35.400 --> 00:37.200

OUT OF MOM AND DAD'S HOUSE

00:39.133 --> 00:40.300
IS A GOOD DAY.

00:40.300 --> 00:42.167
- AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:42.167 --> 00:44.400
EVERYONE ON THE BUS
REALLY LOVED MY HARMONICA.

00:44.400 --> 00:47.000
THEY CLAPPED
WHEN I GOT OFF.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.333
YOU GUYS WANT
TO HEAR A TUNE?

00:48.333 --> 00:50.767
- I REALLY GOT TO GO.

00:50.767 --> 00:52.200
- YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:52.200 --> 00:54.133
I SHOULD PROBABLY GET DOWN

00:54.133 --> 00:55.800
- PETER, DON'T BE SILLY.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.700
WE SHOULD ALL SIT

RAY HAD TO GO.

AND HAVE A SEAT?

01:57.900 --> 01:59.333
YOU KNOW, I FIGURED,

01:59.333 --> 02:01.900
SINCE I MADE
RASPBERRY WAFFLES YESTERDAY,

02:01.900 --> 02:07.433
THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY
GO LOW-CARB, OFFICER BELLY.

02:07.433 --> 02:09.967
OH, SO, DID YOU
SLEEP ALL RIGHT?

02:09.967 --> 02:11.300
- NOT ESPECIALLY.

02:11.300 --> 02:16.200
- I WAS OUT LIKE A PUPPY
IN A PICKUP TRUCK.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.567
I GOT TO TELL YOU,

02:17.567 --> 02:20.233
THAT SOFA IS MORE COMFORTABLE
THAN MY OWN BED.

YOU KNOW WHAT HE DOES?

03:06.967 --> 03:09.767
HE USES FRESH SCALLIONS
IN THE EGGS.

03:09.767 --> 03:11.100
- YEAH.

03:11.100 --> 03:14.133
DID YOU--DID YOU NOTICE
HE WAS WEARING MY SHIRT?

03:14.133 --> 03:15.800
I GUESS HE JUST
WENT INTO THE DRAWER

03:15.800 --> 03:17.800
AND HELPED HIMSELF.

03:17.800 --> 03:20.100
- ACTUALLY, I GAVE IT TO HIM.

03:20.100 --> 03:24.600
- AH!

03:24.600 --> 03:27.133
- HE NEEDS SOMETHING TO WEAR
WHILE HE RINSES OUT HIS CLOTHES.

03:27.133 --> 03:28.833
HE ONLY HAD THE ONE OUTFIT.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.167
- YEAH.

03:30.167 --> 03:31.700
I NOTICED HIS UNDERWEAR
HANGING ON THE DOORKNOB,

03:31.700 --> 03:34.267
WHICH REMINDS ME,
IF YOU GO OUT TODAY,

03:34.267 --> 03:39.433
PICK UP A NEW DOORKNOB.

03:39.433 --> 03:41.967
- OOH, THAT'S RIGHT.

03:41.967 --> 03:45.133
I ALSO GAVE HIM
A PAIR OF YOUR BRIEFS.

03:45.133 --> 03:47.600
I HAD TO PIN THEM.

03:54.100 --> 03:57.733
- AMY...UM...

04:00.200 --> 04:02.500
MAYBE IT'S JUST ME,

04:02.500 --> 04:04.533
BUT ALL YOU DID
WAS ASK HIM TO DINNER,

04:04.533 --> 04:08.000
AND NOW HE'S LIVING
ON OUR COUCH.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.367
- OH, ROBERT,

04:09.367 --> 04:10.700
HE'S BEEN NOTHING
BUT NICE AND HELPFUL

04:10.700 --> 04:11.967
SINCE HE GOT HERE.

04:11.967 --> 04:16.400
- I'M SORRY.
HONEY...

04:18.800 --> 04:23.467
I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS.

COME--COME ON.
AMY, STOP CRYING.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.500
PLEASE DON'T CRY.

STAND IT WHEN YOU--

04:33.467 --> 04:36.133
LOOK! FRUIT!

04:36.133 --> 04:39.100
NO...YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S MY FAULT.

04:39.100 --> 04:42.667
I KNOW YOU NEVER LIKED PETER.
I NEVER SHOULD'VE LET HIM STAY.

04:42.667 --> 04:45.100
BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU'D GET TO KNOW HIM,

04:45.100 --> 04:48.000
'CAUSE HE'S REALLY VERY SWEET.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.233
- NO, NO. I KNOW,

04:49.233 --> 04:50.733
BUT, YOU KNOW,
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,

04:50.733 --> 04:54.333
HE'S A LITTLE...

04:57.000 --> 04:59.067
- NO...I KNOW.

04:59.067 --> 05:02.867
WE ALL KNOW.

05:02.867 --> 05:05.933
- THEN WHY DO WE
NEED HIM HERE?

05:05.933 --> 05:07.833
- BECAUSE HE'S MY BROTHER.

05:07.833 --> 05:09.533
YOU KNOW, ROBERT,

05:09.533 --> 05:11.400
I MAKE AN EFFORT
WITH YOUR FAMILY.

05:11.400 --> 05:16.733
I TRY...
BECAUSE THEY'RE A LITTLE...

05:16.733 --> 05:18.200

05:18.200 --> 05:20.067
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

05:20.067 --> 05:22.333
OKAY, STOP CRYING,
STOP CRYING, COME ON.

THE OLD RUMBLY IN THE TUMBLY?

05:28.700 --> 05:31.133

05:31.133 --> 05:34.033
HAVE YOU SPOKEN
TO MOM AND DAD?

05:34.033 --> 05:35.433
- YEAH.
I CALLED THEM YESTERDAY.

05:35.433 --> 05:36.933
YOU KNOW
WHAT I TOLD THEM?

05:36.933 --> 05:39.867
I TOLD THEM
HOW MUCH I LOVE IT HERE.

05:39.867 --> 05:43.167
AND THEY GO, "WELL,
WHEN ARE YOU COMING HOME?"

05:43.167 --> 05:45.167
AND I GO, "I'LL SEE YOU
WHEN I SEE YOU.

05:45.167 --> 05:49.300
NEW YORK IS MY LADY."

05:54.800 --> 05:57.000
- THAT'S GREAT, PETER.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.600
WHAT DID THEY SAY?

05:58.600 --> 06:00.400
- THEY DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

06:00.400 --> 06:01.867
THEY'RE SO WRAPPED UP
IN THEIR LITTLE

AND I'LL GET TO THEM LATER.

I WASN'T CLEAR
ON THE ARRANGEMENTS.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.733

TO BE THE FOUR OF US.

- OH, WELL...COULDN'T IT BE
THE FIVE OF US?

07:03.667 --> 07:05.167
- WELL, SURE.

07:05.167 --> 07:09.967
BUT IS THAT REALLY FAIR
TO RAY AND DEBRA?

- NO, PETER.
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.

AMY WAS WRONG ABOUT YOU.

07:42.767 --> 07:44.300
YOU'RE NOT NICE,
YOU'RE NOT SENSITIVE,

07:44.300 --> 07:45.367
AND I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE,

07:45.367 --> 07:46.867
YOU'RE NOT A GRACIOUS HOST.

07:46.867 --> 07:50.500

YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
BE ABLE

08:29.533 --> 08:30.967
TO GET
A BUS HOME TONIGHT.

08:30.967 --> 08:32.567
- THEN I'LL SLEEP THERE
OVERNIGHT.

08:32.567 --> 08:36.867
NOBODY JUDGES YOU
ON THE FLOOR OF THE BUS STATION.

08:36.867 --> 08:38.833

ROBERT, PLEASE, DO SOMETHING!

08:40.733 --> 08:42.067

09:07.367 --> 09:11.233
YOU'RE GONNA STAY HERE
AND BE MY FRIEND!

09:11.233 --> 09:13.467
- MAYBE PETER COULD
STAY AT OUR HOUSE TONIGHT.

09:13.467 --> 09:19.100
- WAIT A MIN--NO.
NO, OUR HOUSE--IT'S BROKEN.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.033

GO WITH ROBERT.

09:22.033 --> 09:23.367
HE CAN'T GO WITH AMY.

09:23.367 --> 09:24.567
HE CAN'T SLEEP
AT THE BUS STATION.

09:24.567 --> 09:26.067
YOU EITHER DRIVE HIM
TO PENNSYLVANIA,

09:26.067 --> 09:28.333
OR HE SLEEPS AT OUR HOUSE.

HI.

10:29.167 --> 10:30.933
IT WAS QUITE A LONG DRIVE.

10:30.933 --> 10:32.300
COULD I JUST USE
YOUR FACILITIES?

10:32.300 --> 10:33.533
- CERTAINLY.
COME IN.

10:33.533 --> 10:34.933
RIGHT THROUGH THERE
AND TO THE LEFT.

10:34.933 --> 10:38.433
THERE ARE CHERUBS
ON THE DOOR.

10:38.433 --> 10:41.567
- UH, MAMA, WHAT ARE YOU
WORKING ON HERE?

10:41.567 --> 10:44.400
- OH,
JUST TIDYING UP A BIT.

10:44.400 --> 10:48.933
- YEAH, MAMA, BUT THESE
ARE ALL MY FOGHAT ALBUMS.

10:48.933 --> 10:50.767
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TOUCHING THESE?

10:50.767 --> 10:54.600
- PAT, YOU WON'T BELIEVE
THE FILTH HE'S GOT DOWN THERE.

10:54.600 --> 10:59.567
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF
SOMETHING CALLED "MAD" MAGAZINE?

11:02.200 --> 11:04.800
OH, PETER.

11:04.800 --> 11:07.267
- [scoffs]
MY STUFF.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.933
[stammers] WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TOUCHING MY STUFF?

11:09.933 --> 11:11.600
- WELL, YOU SEE, PETER,

11:11.600 --> 11:16.200
WE'RE SORT OF RECONSIDERING
THE LAYOUT OF THE BASEMENT.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.067
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:18.067 --> 11:20.967
- HOW IT WOULD LAY OUT
IF YOU WERE...

11:20.967 --> 11:23.533
GONE.

11:29.967 --> 11:32.300
- SO, WAIT A SECOND.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.933
I-I TAKE OFF FOR A WEEK,
AND YOU'RE MOVING ME OUT?

11:34.933 --> 11:36.700
- WE'RE CHANGING
THE BASEMENT

11:36.700 --> 11:41.800
INTO A PRAYER
AND BIBLE STUDY ROOM.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.767
- WHAT?

11:43.767 --> 11:46.800
- WELL, PETER, WHEN YOU SAID
NEW YORK WAS YOUR LADY,

11:46.800 --> 11:48.767
WE WERE A LITTLE CONCERNED.

11:48.767 --> 11:52.600
BUT THEN WE SORT OF
GOT USED TO THE IDEA.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.800
- AND AS TIME WENT BY,
WE THOUGHT,

11:54.800 --> 11:56.933
"OUR BOY'S GROWING UP.

11:56.933 --> 12:00.533
HE'S READY TO BE ON HIS OWN."

12:06.733 --> 12:12.233
- GOOD LUCK, SON.

12:12.233 --> 12:15.067
- SO...THAT'S IT?

12:15.067 --> 12:16.400
- I'M SORRY, PETER,

12:16.400 --> 12:19.533
BUT WE GAVE
YOUR ROOM TO JESUS.

12:24.233 --> 12:26.900
- JESUS DOESN'T NEED A ROOM!

12:26.900 --> 12:30.300
HIS DAD
DIDN'T THROW HIM OUT!

12:30.300 --> 12:32.967
I NEED MY KITTY!
WHERE'S MISS PUSS?

12:32.967 --> 12:34.567
MISS PUSS-PUSS!

12:34.567 --> 12:37.567
SHE'S OUTSIDE.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.233
WHAT?

12:41.233 --> 12:44.100
OUTSIDE?
NO!

12:44.100 --> 12:47.833
MISS PUSS IS AN INSIDE CAT!

12:47.833 --> 12:51.300
- NOT ANYMORE.

12:55.567 --> 12:57.500
- OH!

12:57.500 --> 12:59.267
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

12:59.267 --> 13:02.367
YOU GOT ONE OF THOSE SEATS
THAT KEEPS FALLING DOWN.

13:02.367 --> 13:07.700
DON'T WORRY, THOUGH.
IT ALL WORKED OUT.

13:07.700 --> 13:13.367
YOU'RE THE WORST PARENTS
IN THE WHOLE WORLD!

13:13.367 --> 13:17.167
- OKAY. GOOD NIGHT.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.000
- WAIT, RAY!

13:22.000 --> 13:23.300
- YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

13:23.300 --> 13:24.767
I DON'T NEED
TO LIVE HERE ANYMORE!

13:24.767 --> 13:27.467
I'LL JUST GO WHERE
I'M APPRECIATED, OKAY?

13:27.467 --> 13:33.133
OH, AND I HOPE JESUS DOES
A GOOD JOB MOWING THE LAWN!

13:34.767 --> 13:38.600
RAY, GIVE ME A HAND
WITH THESE, WILL YA? THANKS.

13:41.567 --> 13:43.333
- WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:43.333 --> 13:46.233
WHERE'S HE GOING?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.633
[overlapping greetings]

13:56.633 --> 13:58.300
- THANKS SO MUCH.

13:58.300 --> 14:02.100
- YOU PUT THE FRUITCAKE BACK
IN THE BOX?

14:05.933 --> 14:07.367
- YEAH.

14:07.367 --> 14:11.167
BUT, UH, TURNS OUT
NOBODY LIKES FRUITCAKE.

14:13.833 --> 14:17.833
- MISS PUSS?
MISS PUSS-PUSS?

14:17.833 --> 14:22.633
- OH, GOD.

14:22.633 --> 14:25.967
- SHE SCRATCHED ME
AND THEN RAN UP A TREE.

14:25.967 --> 14:29.133
MY PARENTS SCREWED HER UP TOO.

14:29.133 --> 14:32.133
- PETER, I THOUGHT YOU WENT
BACK HOME.

14:32.133 --> 14:34.500
- I HAVE NO HOME.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.333
I'M GONNA GO SEE
IF I CAN GET MISS PUSS BACK

14:36.333 --> 14:38.333
WITH A SAUCER OF MILK.

14:38.333 --> 14:39.533
- WHAT?

14:39.533 --> 14:41.333
[door closes]
WHAT HAPPENED?

14:41.333 --> 14:43.633
- WELL, YOUR FATHER SAID

14:43.633 --> 14:45.500
THEY'RE GOING TO TURN HIS ROOM
INTO A...

14:45.500 --> 14:48.300
PRAYER CHAMBER
OR SOMETHING.

14:48.300 --> 14:49.500
- WHY DOESN'T THAT GUY

14:49.500 --> 14:51.133
JUST PUT A STEEPLE
ON HIS ROOF

14:51.133 --> 14:54.267
AND CALL IT A DAY?

14:54.267 --> 14:56.167
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

14:56.167 --> 14:58.633
- THEY SAID THAT
HE'S A GROWN MAN

14:58.633 --> 15:00.500
AND HE SHOULD GET ON
WITH HIS LIFE.

15:00.500 --> 15:04.300
- SO NOW HE'S HERE
TO END OURS.

15:05.867 --> 15:07.767
- BUT THAT JUST
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE MY PARENTS.

15:07.767 --> 15:10.967
THEY LOVED HAVING HIM THERE.
THEY DID EVERYTHING FOR HIM.

15:10.967 --> 15:13.600
- AMY, DEAR,
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND.

15:13.600 --> 15:17.833
A CHILD IS LIKE...
A BABY ROBIN--

15:17.833 --> 15:19.367
YOU FEED HIM,
YOU NURTURE HIM,

15:19.367 --> 15:20.867
YOU GET HIM STRONG,

15:20.867 --> 15:22.700
SO WHEN THE TIME COMES,
HE'S READY TO FLY AWAY

15:22.700 --> 15:26.433
AND BRING YOU BACK
GRAND-ROBINS.

15:26.433 --> 15:28.533
AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH
YOU WANT HIM TO,

15:28.533 --> 15:31.900
SOMETIMES THERE'S A ROBIN
WHO JUST WON'T FLY AWAY.

15:31.900 --> 15:34.100
- AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
YOU GOT A 40-YEAR-OLD ROBIN

15:34.100 --> 15:38.000
WHO CAN'T LIFT HIS ASS
OUT OF THE NEST.

15:47.567 --> 15:49.767
- I GUESS IT HAD BEEN GOING ON
FOR SO LONG

15:49.767 --> 15:52.733
THAT WE ALL JUST
GOT USED TO IT, BUT I KNOW--

15:52.733 --> 15:55.633
- YEAH. A 40-YEAR-OLD MAN STILL
LIVING AT HIS PARENTS' HOUSE

15:55.633 --> 15:59.533
IS A LITTLE WEIRD.

16:05.867 --> 16:08.800
- WELL, THE BOY GETS
USED TO CERTAIN THINGS...

16:08.800 --> 16:10.833
YOUR MOTHER DOING
YOUR LAUNDRY FOR YOU

16:10.833 --> 16:12.700
AND FIXING YOUR MEALS.

16:12.700 --> 16:15.300
- CHANGING YOUR DIAPER.

16:15.300 --> 16:19.133
- TAKING YOUR TEMPERATURE
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.

16:24.633 --> 16:28.033
YEAH. THEY DON'T
DO THAT ANYMORE, RIGHT?

16:28.033 --> 16:34.000
THEY SHOULD DO THAT.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.833
- HEY.

16:35.833 --> 16:38.467
- [sniffs]
THIS IS 2%.

16:38.467 --> 16:42.267
MISS PUSS
WILL NEVER GO FOR THIS.

16:44.333 --> 16:46.600
- ROUGH NIGHT, HUH?

16:46.600 --> 16:47.567
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.

16:47.567 --> 16:49.233
I HEARD YOU ALL
IN THERE LAUGHING.

16:49.233 --> 16:51.200
- I WASN'T LAUGHING.

16:51.200 --> 16:53.033
- OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

16:53.033 --> 16:56.567
- LISTEN...PETER...

16:56.567 --> 16:58.900
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

16:58.900 --> 17:00.533
- NO, YOU DON'T.

17:00.533 --> 17:01.800
DO YOU KNOW THAT
IF I HAD COME HOME

17:01.800 --> 17:03.200
TEN MINUTES LATER,

17:03.200 --> 17:04.467
I WOULD'VE HAD
TO GO THROUGH THE GARBAGE

17:04.467 --> 17:08.267
TO FIND MY BLUEPRINTS
TO THE BATCAVE?

17:11.767 --> 17:13.533
- WELL, I WASN'T OUT OF
MY FOLKS' HOUSE TEN MINUTES

17:13.533 --> 17:15.600
BEFORE MY DAD STARTED
PUTTING IN A JACUZZI

17:15.600 --> 17:17.800
WHERE MY BED USED TO BE.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.833
- THEY PUT IN A JACUZZI?

17:19.833 --> 17:22.900
WELL, YOUR PARENTS ARE COOL.

17:22.900 --> 17:26.467
- COME LOOK AT 'EM USE IT.

17:29.567 --> 17:32.267
NOT SO COOL.

17:34.300 --> 17:36.533
- MAN, I JUST DIDN'T SEE
THIS ONE COMING.

17:36.533 --> 17:38.533
I MEAN, EVERY NIGHT,
MY MOTHER WOULD LEAVE

17:38.533 --> 17:40.600
A PLATE OF COOKIES
AND A CUP OF HOT COCOA

17:40.600 --> 17:41.733
OUTSIDE MY DOOR.

17:41.733 --> 17:44.200
DOES THAT SAY
"GET THE HELL OUT" TO YOU?

17:44.200 --> 17:46.067
- YEAH, THEY SEND YOU
ALL THESE MIXED SIGNALS.

17:46.067 --> 17:47.800
MY MOM WAS THE SAME WAY.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.667
WITH THE FOOD--
ALL THE MEATS AND THE SAUCES.

17:50.667 --> 17:54.500
YOU'RE ALL DOPED UP
LIKE A BEAR IN THE ZOO.

17:58.333 --> 17:59.933
YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE THERE,

17:59.933 --> 18:03.567
BUT YOU LOSE THE WILL
TO ESCAPE.

18:03.567 --> 18:04.900
- YEAH.

18:04.900 --> 18:07.300
YEAH!

18:07.300 --> 18:09.133
- AND I THOUGHT I WAS DOING THEM
A FAVOR BY STAYING.

18:09.133 --> 18:10.800
- YEAH, ME TOO.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.067
- THEY WANT YOU THERE

18:12.067 --> 18:13.667
UNTIL THEY DON'T
WANT YOU THERE.

18:13.667 --> 18:17.100
- YOU KNOW, I GOT THE RAW DEAL
'CAUSE I WAS THE OLDEST.

18:17.100 --> 18:19.233
SO THEY MADE
ALL THEIR MISTAKES WITH ME.

18:19.233 --> 18:20.700
- YEAH, YEAH, ME TOO.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.333
IT'S LIKE I WAS
THE PRACTICE KID.

18:22.333 --> 18:23.567
IT'S LIKE,
"OH, OH, WELL,

18:23.567 --> 18:27.300
NOW WE KNOW
NOT TO DROP RAYMOND."

18:33.233 --> 18:36.067
- YEAH, YOU KNOW,
IN MY HOUSE, IT WAS,

18:36.067 --> 18:38.500
"NOT NOW, PETER.
AMY'S PLAYING THE PIANO.

18:38.500 --> 18:42.300
TAKE OFF YOUR CAPE
AND EAT YOUR DINNER."

18:55.533 --> 18:56.900
- YOU HUNGRY?

18:56.900 --> 18:58.667
- MAN, I AM STARVED!

18:58.667 --> 19:00.433
I TRIED
TO GET YOUR BROTHER TO STOP,

19:00.433 --> 19:03.833
BUT HE WAS DRIVING SO FAST.

19:03.833 --> 19:05.433
COME ON.

19:05.433 --> 19:09.233
I'LL BET THERE'S SOMETHING
IN THE FRIDGE.

19:21.367 --> 19:24.267
- WELL, I HEAR THEY'RE
LOOKING FOR PEOPLE.

19:24.267 --> 19:25.667
- MA, PETER'S NOT
EVEN CATHOLIC.

19:25.667 --> 19:29.633
THEY'RE NOT GONNA
LET HIM BE A PRIEST!

19:29.633 --> 19:31.000
- I TELL YOU WHAT
HE SHOULD DO--

19:31.000 --> 19:32.700
JOIN THE SERVICE.

19:32.700 --> 19:36.500
PUT A LITTLE FUZZ
ON THE KIWIS.

19:41.767 --> 19:44.900
[chatting quietly]

19:44.900 --> 19:46.133
- YOU COULD DO IT THERE,
OF COURSE.

19:46.133 --> 19:48.333
- DEBBIE, RAYMOND,

19:48.333 --> 19:50.167
I APPRECIATE
THE GENEROUS OFFER,

19:50.167 --> 19:52.400
BUT I WON'T BE
STAYING WITH YOU TONIGHT.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.467
- YEP. HE'S COMING
HOME WITH US.

19:54.467 --> 19:58.267
- REALLY?
- REALLY?

20:00.333 --> 20:02.267
- AND TOMORROW
AFTER BREAKFAST,

20:02.267 --> 20:03.900
I'M TAKING HIM BY
MY OLD BUILDING.

20:03.900 --> 20:07.033
- YEAH, ROBERT SAYS HIS OLD
APARTMENT IS STILL AVAILABLE,

20:07.033 --> 20:08.567
AND, APPARENTLY,

20:08.567 --> 20:11.800
THERE'S QUITE AN ACTIVE
SOCIAL SCENE THERE, SO...

20:11.800 --> 20:12.867
- ROBERT!

20:12.867 --> 20:15.600
THAT'S A WONDERFUL IDEA!

20:15.600 --> 20:19.067
- I CAN'T WAIT
TO TELL MISS PUSS!

20:23.500 --> 20:27.033
- I'M REALLY PROUD OF YOU.

20:27.033 --> 20:29.367
- YEAH, HE'S A GOOD KID.

20:29.367 --> 20:33.000
- COME ON.
LET'S GO RENEW OUR FRIENDSHIP.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.133
- AHH.

20:36.133 --> 20:39.733
PAYS TO BE NICE.

20:43.167 --> 20:45.567
- THOSE TWO THINK
THEIR TROUBLES ARE OVER.

20:45.567 --> 20:48.100
BELIEVE ME, YOU DON'T WANT
A RELATIVE LIKE THAT

20:48.100 --> 20:51.467
LIVING SO CLOSE TO YOU.

20:58.567 --> 21:00.067
[door opens]

21:01.033 --> 21:03.733
- HEY. LOOK WHAT
PETER LEFT IN MY CAR.

21:03.733 --> 21:05.933
HE IS SO ANNOYING.

21:05.933 --> 21:07.467
- HE'S NOT SO BAD.

21:07.467 --> 21:10.233
- NO? TRY FOUR HOURS OF THIS.

21:10.233 --> 21:15.200
[playing harmonica]

21:22.467 --> 21:26.267
- DID YOU
RINSE THAT OFF FIRST?

21:27.900 --> 21:31.533
- AAH!

21:34.833 --> 21:38.467
[spitting]

21:44.767 --> 21:48.367
- IDIOT.
