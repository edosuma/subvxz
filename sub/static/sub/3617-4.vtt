00:31.506 --> 00:35.197
- What are you doing?
- The DJ is really good, huh?

00:35.297 --> 00:37.408
Yeah. Too bad
she's not really good at P3.

00:37.509 --> 00:38.701
Right. Sorry.

00:38.801 --> 00:40.868
Focus, we are here
on business, not pleasure.

00:40.968 --> 00:42.411
Okay. I know, I know.

00:42.511 --> 00:44.495
But don't you think
you're overreacting a little?

00:44.595 --> 00:47.496
No, I don't.
This club has become
the hottest thing in town,

00:47.596 --> 00:49.831
and I'd like to know
what they're doing
that I am not.

00:49.931 --> 00:51.206
Well, P3 is still doing great.

00:51.306 --> 00:53.374
Not as great as it used to be,
thanks to me.

00:53.474 --> 00:56.750
Well, Piper,
you're having a baby.
Your priorities have changed.

00:56.850 --> 00:58.209
Yeah, well, haven't you heard?

00:58.309 --> 01:02.087
Women can have careers
and babies now.
It's been in all the papers.

01:02.187 --> 01:04.337
Are those women trying
to save the world
from demons too?

01:04.437 --> 01:08.773
Ugh. Oh, for God's sakes,
people, get a room.

01:09.523 --> 01:13.092
- Piper.
- Paige.

01:13.192 --> 01:16.342
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, you know, just hanging
out.

01:16.442 --> 01:18.677
You couldn't hang out
at our club?

01:18.777 --> 01:21.721
What, and miss this DJ?
Come on.

01:21.821 --> 01:26.305
This is my other sister, Piper,
and her husband, Leo.
This is Dave.

01:26.405 --> 01:28.099
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too, mate.

01:28.199 --> 01:29.724
I didn't know there was a Dave.

01:29.824 --> 01:32.600
Oh, we've only been hanging out
for, like, three weeks.

01:32.700 --> 01:34.224
PIPER:
Weeks?

01:34.324 --> 01:35.518
Here you go.

01:35.618 --> 01:37.769
Oh, hi, Piper.

01:37.869 --> 01:42.105
Hey. Hey. Wow, you're up late.

01:42.205 --> 01:44.229
- What are you doing here?
- Right back at you.

01:44.329 --> 01:46.356
- Wh--? Uh...
- Dave, how about I buy you
a drink?

01:46.456 --> 01:48.024
- Yeah.
- I've got one, thanks.

01:48.124 --> 01:51.232
That's not gonna be enough.

01:51.332 --> 01:52.776
I thought you were working
tonight.

01:52.876 --> 01:55.234
Yeah, well, I mean,
actually, I'm working here.

01:55.334 --> 01:58.154
You know, I thought
that guys could help me

01:58.254 --> 02:01.321
with my advice
to other guys, you know?

02:01.421 --> 02:03.338
And that guy over there
with the dimples.

02:05.090 --> 02:07.867
Hi. Yeah, huge help. Yeah.

02:07.967 --> 02:10.076
See, yeah,
I don't know what bugs me more.

02:10.175 --> 02:13.077
The fact that you guys are here,
or that you're here without me.

02:13.177 --> 02:15.828
Oh, we just didn't think
it would be good for the baby.

02:15.928 --> 02:18.246
You know, all the noise
and the people.

02:18.346 --> 02:21.581
Yeah, I know. But sometimes
it's good for the mommy
to get out.

02:21.681 --> 02:23.373
Okay, so you would have
wanted to come?

02:23.473 --> 02:25.666
No, but that is
beside the point.

02:25.766 --> 02:29.250
- You're a very confusing woman.
- It's all right.
Hey, it's no big deal.

02:29.350 --> 02:32.252
You guys, I'll see you at home.

02:32.352 --> 02:34.728
Oh, Piper.

02:36.855 --> 02:39.254
- Still think this is
a good idea?
- Well, you know Piper.

02:39.354 --> 02:42.256
She won't slow down
unless someone slows her down.

02:42.357 --> 02:46.400
I just don't want to do anything
to add to her stress.

02:48.277 --> 02:49.359
You seem stressed.

02:51.361 --> 02:53.028
Arnon, you scared me.

02:57.239 --> 02:59.263
What are you doing out here?

02:59.363 --> 03:02.641
Door is locked,
so I thought I'd practice
drawing while I waited.

03:02.741 --> 03:05.018
Good.

03:05.118 --> 03:06.727
Not really.

03:06.827 --> 03:09.936
I don't know, I just can't seem
to make it work.

03:10.036 --> 03:12.312
I've done everything you said,
tried to focus--

03:12.412 --> 03:14.788
Then you're not trying
hard enough.

03:19.708 --> 03:23.567
You have a special gift, Kevin.
A very special gift.

03:23.667 --> 03:27.044
And if you're to master it,
you have to believe in it fully.

03:31.963 --> 03:35.280
You draw to see it better,
but it'll never be real,

03:35.380 --> 03:37.549
not unless you make it real
in your mind's eye.

03:39.382 --> 03:40.550
Make it real, Kevin.

03:43.218 --> 03:44.719

that hero of yours real too.

To take care of
your little problem.

Yo.

- I'm just trying
to get home, Kaz.
- Listen.

We've had this conversation.

06:03.447 --> 06:05.432
This is where I do my business.

getting bothered.

mustard? Are you seriously
eating that?

That was the plan.

Wait a minute,
you didn't come home all night?

08:19.509 --> 08:22.079
No, Mom. Why?

08:22.179 --> 08:23.704
I must be going nuts.

08:23.804 --> 08:26.915
Because I could have sworn
I saw you when I walked past
your room.

08:27.015 --> 08:28.765
Was it about 2:30?

08:30.016 --> 08:32.414
Was I half-naked?

08:32.515 --> 08:34.833
Paige, what's going on?

08:34.934 --> 08:38.419
- Nothing. I don't want
to bother you.
- You're not bothering me.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.879
Why does everybody think
they're bothering me?

08:40.979 --> 08:42.421
I'm not bothered.
What's the matter?

08:42.520 --> 08:46.422
Well, I was sort of
messing around with Dave, and--

08:46.522 --> 08:50.176
- Messing around?
- Yeah, having "sex."

08:50.276 --> 08:52.425
- Oh.
- This is why I don't want

08:52.525 --> 08:53.676
to talk to you about this.

08:53.776 --> 08:55.719
It's weird talking to a pregnant
lady about sex anyway.

08:55.819 --> 08:58.887
Well, Paige, how do you think
I got pregnant?

08:58.988 --> 09:02.181
Ugh. I don't want
to know that either.

09:02.281 --> 09:06.431
Anyway, so we were doing,
you know,

09:06.531 --> 09:12.186
and I was about to, you know,
and suddenly I orbed out
upstairs.

09:12.286 --> 09:15.020
Oh, my God. You didn't?

09:15.120 --> 09:16.854
- Did he notice?
- No, thank God.

09:16.954 --> 09:19.314
I orbed back in
before the lights came back on.

09:19.414 --> 09:21.438
- Talk about embarrassing.
- Forget embarrassing.

09:21.538 --> 09:24.358
Paige, you could have had
some serious explaining to do.

09:24.458 --> 09:26.483
Well, I didn't plan on
orbing out, Piper.

09:26.583 --> 09:29.441
It wasn't exactly my particular
goal at the moment.

09:29.541 --> 09:34.279
Okay, so why do you think
this is happening?

09:34.379 --> 09:37.280
I mean, is he not
getting the job done?

09:37.380 --> 09:40.990
No, he's getting
the job done fine.

09:41.090 --> 09:45.617
I think I like him a lot.

09:45.717 --> 09:48.450
And, I mean, other than Glen,

09:48.550 --> 09:52.578
he's the first guy
I've been with since
I found out I was a witch.

09:52.678 --> 09:58.165
I think I'm so busy protecting
this big old secret of ours that

09:58.265 --> 10:00.932
I guess I can't really
let my guard down.

10:02.517 --> 10:03.641

Sorry. I'm sorry.
Are you all right?

10:13.772 --> 10:15.881
Been orbing long, have we?

10:15.981 --> 10:17.757
Hey, I'm a little nervous.

10:17.857 --> 10:20.465
Leo, what happened?
We heard a crash.

10:20.565 --> 10:22.466
He missed.

10:22.566 --> 10:24.468
Huh, who's the critic?

10:24.568 --> 10:25.802
Uh...

10:25.902 --> 10:28.552
This is Ramus. He's an Elder.

10:28.652 --> 10:31.305
An Elder? Really?

10:31.405 --> 10:34.056
I thought you told us
he wasn't coming till tonight.

10:34.156 --> 10:37.391
Told us? Nobody told me
anything. Leo?

10:37.492 --> 10:39.350
We didn't want you
to worry about demonic threats

10:39.450 --> 10:41.977
until it was absolutely
necessary.

10:42.077 --> 10:43.394
What threats?

10:43.494 --> 10:46.661
Well, I suppose this
will have to do.

10:48.621 --> 10:50.230
Okay.

10:50.330 --> 10:52.856
What are you two up to?

10:52.956 --> 10:54.983
It was Phoebe's idea.

10:55.083 --> 10:57.442
We were just trying to make
things a little easier,
that's all.

10:57.542 --> 10:59.192
- Relieve some stress.
- Well, stop it,

10:59.292 --> 11:03.484
because it's pissing me off.
I'm pregnant, not terminal.

11:03.584 --> 11:06.486
So, what--?
What is he doing here?

11:06.586 --> 11:07.946
Ramus is retiring.

11:08.046 --> 11:10.656
He came down to pass on
his powers to a new Elder.

11:10.756 --> 11:12.488
- So?
- So?

11:12.589 --> 11:15.367
There isn't a demon alive
who wouldn't love to have his
powers.

11:15.467 --> 11:18.159
So the Elders want you
to protect him in case
there's an attack.

11:18.259 --> 11:20.202
Why couldn't he just orb out?

11:20.302 --> 11:23.745
Because my powers are mental,
young lady, not physical.

11:23.845 --> 11:28.264
You'd think a charge of yours
would know something
as basic as that.

11:31.474 --> 11:32.624
Nothing wrong with his hearing.

11:32.724 --> 11:35.499
- No, just his attitude.
- Piper.

11:35.599 --> 11:37.210
- What?
- Little respect.

11:37.310 --> 11:39.501
Ugh.
For crying out loud.

11:39.601 --> 11:42.170
So who is this new Elder,
and when does he get here?

11:42.270 --> 11:45.504
We don't know who he is.
All we know is that the transfer

11:45.604 --> 11:48.505
must take place
during tonight's equinox,

11:48.605 --> 11:51.299
or else I will lose my powers
forever.

11:51.399 --> 11:55.301
So we're just supposed to
sit around here and wait?

11:55.401 --> 11:59.278
Yes. Unfortunately.

12:20.287 --> 12:22.897
Arnon?

12:22.997 --> 12:27.523
- I was getting worried
about you, Kevin.
- Arnon, you scared me.

12:27.623 --> 12:29.083
Sorry.

12:33.085 --> 12:34.336
Where's The Aggressor?

12:35.626 --> 12:38.628
He's...
He's gone.

12:40.172 --> 12:41.864
- I ripped up the drawing.
- You what?

12:41.964 --> 12:45.324
He killed a guy.
Arnon, he killed Kaz.

12:45.424 --> 12:48.909
Isn't that why you wanted me
to help you create your
superhero?

12:49.009 --> 12:51.760
- No, not to kill.
I never wanted that.
- He was a bad guy, wasn't he?

12:53.010 --> 12:54.635
Just like Ramus is.

12:55.636 --> 12:56.971
I'm not drawing him again.

12:57.805 --> 13:00.390
Arnon, I'm sorry.

13:02.099 --> 13:03.915
We had a deal.

13:04.015 --> 13:06.125
I help you, you help me,
remember?

13:06.225 --> 13:10.210
Now, I need The Aggressor
to take out Ramus.

13:10.310 --> 13:13.296
To rid him of his powers.

13:13.396 --> 13:15.963
Why can't you just
take him out yourself?

13:16.063 --> 13:20.548
I told you, I only have the
ability to sense great powers,
not possess them.

13:20.648 --> 13:24.067
That's how I found you,
that's how I'll find Ramus.

13:26.402 --> 13:29.069
Now, help me
do the right thing, Kevin.

13:31.404 --> 13:33.929
Bring your superhero
back to life,

13:34.029 --> 13:36.573
before somebody else
loses theirs.

13:41.867 --> 13:44.558
- Those are all life and death?
- Well, not literally.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.061
At least, not most of them.

13:46.161 --> 13:48.603
What am I supposed to do?
I can't keep up,
they just keep coming.

13:48.703 --> 13:50.103
What can you do?

13:50.204 --> 13:51.645
Answer two or three a day,
ignore the rest.

13:51.745 --> 13:54.606
- You can't help everybody.
- Yeah, that's the problem.

- PIPER: So, what do you say

like a porcelain doll?

- "Thank you"?
- How about, "knock it off"?

14:10.338 --> 14:13.073
That's probably better advice.
Are you mad at me?

14:13.173 --> 14:15.572
No, not if you come home
and babysit Ramus.

14:15.672 --> 14:19.284
Oh, sweetie, I can't.
I've got a gazillion letters
that I have to get to.

wait. I've got DJs to audition.

No, these are
a lot more serious than that.

Oh, no. Are you kidding?
It was awesome.

39:41.369 --> 39:43.980
I mean, being a witch
is still awesome.

39:44.080 --> 39:46.814
It's just that there's
a new number one in town.

39:46.914 --> 39:48.774
- Good for you.
- Yeah.

39:48.874 --> 39:51.734
And apparently, good for you.

39:51.834 --> 39:55.275
Since you worked through
your issues with Dave, I gather.

39:55.375 --> 39:59.820
Yes, I did, thank God.
I was just about
to join a convent.

39:59.920 --> 40:02.155
Mm-hm. Must have been
the pink leather,
broke you down.

40:02.255 --> 40:04.280
Don't laugh, but I think
it might have been.

40:04.380 --> 40:07.281
Something about leaping
over tall buildings
in a single bound.

40:07.381 --> 40:10.825
- I guess that will free
any girl up.
- And let your guard down.

40:10.925 --> 40:13.744
Yeah, I'm gonna take your
advice, and just, you know,
relax.

40:13.844 --> 40:18.263
If he's Mr. Right, I'll tell him
I fly around on broomsticks.

40:20.180 --> 40:21.663
He may find out by himself.

40:21.763 --> 40:23.915
- What?
- Cole just called.

40:24.015 --> 40:27.250
He said the idiot slumlord
wants to meet Cole and me, now.

40:27.350 --> 40:29.291
- Why?
- Oh, I don't know.
Something about

40:29.391 --> 40:33.336
having a tape of Cole's
superhero ex-wife in action.

40:33.436 --> 40:35.394
Oh, no.

40:42.357 --> 40:43.882
COLE:
What do you want?

40:43.983 --> 40:47.717
Well, your wife off my back,
for starters.

40:47.817 --> 40:51.053
Then, maybe 50 grand a month.

40:51.153 --> 40:52.762
- Fifty grand.
- Yeah.

40:52.862 --> 40:55.513
And if they don't have it,
they can certainly get it.

40:55.613 --> 40:58.864
Just put on those cute
little outfits.

41:02.949 --> 41:04.407
They don't have them anymore.

41:05.450 --> 41:07.408
Well, they better find them.

41:08.869 --> 41:10.353
I wouldn't try anything
if I were you.

41:10.453 --> 41:12.729
All right, this is just a copy.

41:12.829 --> 41:14.312
I can find the original.

41:14.412 --> 41:16.064
Oh, yeah? How?

41:16.164 --> 41:19.274
Well, I have certain powers too.

41:19.374 --> 41:22.108
But I'm trying very hard
not to use them.

41:22.208 --> 41:23.609
Very hard.

41:23.709 --> 41:26.152
I don't like what they do to me.

41:26.252 --> 41:28.986
Yeah, okay. Whatever, pal.

41:29.086 --> 41:31.029
Guess I'll just sell this
to the highest bidder.

41:31.129 --> 41:34.381
- I can't let you do that.
- Try and stop me.

41:35.131 --> 41:36.465
MILLER:
No!

41:43.093 --> 41:45.410
- Is he here?
- Who?

41:45.510 --> 41:48.327
Miller. Edward Miller.
You said he was coming.

41:48.427 --> 41:49.971
Oh, yeah.

41:51.679 --> 41:53.181
I took care of it.

41:54.640 --> 41:56.291
What do you mean?

41:56.391 --> 41:57.916
What does that mean?

41:58.016 --> 42:00.167
Phoebe, he was gonna expose you.

42:00.267 --> 42:03.669
What was I supposed to do?

42:03.769 --> 42:05.062
Phoebe, wait.
