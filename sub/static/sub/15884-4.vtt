you grew up

00:09.986 --> 00:11.483

00:11.517 --> 00:14.854
That's right.

00:14.888 --> 00:16.891
My whole life,
I had to deal with Adversity.

00:16.925 --> 00:18.956
And that continued
When you went on to the pros?

00:18.991 --> 00:19.989
That's right.

00:20.023 --> 00:22.454
You know, fines,
Injuries, everything.

00:22.488 --> 00:25.419
No matter
How big a star I am,

00:25.453 --> 00:27.886
I'm always gonna
Be dealing with Adversity.

00:27.921 --> 00:30.353
Adversity Johnson,
What's your take on this?

00:30.387 --> 00:32.722
I don't know, girl.
I just like [bleep] with him.

00:32.756 --> 00:33.723

00:40.094 --> 00:43.528

"Deal with me!"

00:43.563 --> 00:44.796
Always.

00:44.830 --> 00:47.462
Wherever we go, it's--

00:47.497 --> 00:49.964
Come on, no, don't.
Don't drink my water.

00:49.999 --> 00:52.266
Don't drink my water.
Adversity, leave me some.

00:52.301 --> 00:53.801
Leave me a sip.
Leave me a sip.

00:53.835 --> 00:55.469
Damn, come on, man.

I just don't want there

02:07.551 --> 02:09.151
to get in the way
of me getting on the flight.

02:09.186 --> 02:10.586
You get impatient

where somebody's
telling you a story,

06:49.173 --> 06:51.140
and halfway through the story,
you realize

06:51.175 --> 06:52.542
they're telling you
the story

06:52.576 --> 06:54.277
you told them
three weeks ago?

06:54.311 --> 06:55.578
It's maddening.

A dude just come up to you,
talkin' about,

06:56.713 --> 06:58.014
Hey, man, y'all see,

06:58.048 --> 06:59.282
I was walking down
the street, right?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:14.732 --> 07:16.599
How you know that, man?

No, because I told you
this story

07:20.404 --> 07:21.971
literally a day ago.

07:22.005 --> 07:22.972
Did I tell you about
this other thing

07:23.007 --> 07:24.240
that happened to me,
though?

07:24.275 --> 07:25.509
I didn't,
but I can't wait to hear it.

07:25.543 --> 07:27.143
Walking down
the street, man,

07:27.178 --> 07:29.813

10:35.430 --> 10:37.398
(sighs)

10:37.432 --> 10:40.367
â™ª

10:40.401 --> 10:42.369
Noice.

10:42.404 --> 10:44.971
â™ª

10:45.006 --> 10:47.974
Noice.

10:48.009 --> 10:51.678
â™ª

10:51.712 --> 10:54.481
Noice!

10:54.515 --> 10:56.216
(cries)
Noice.

10:56.250 --> 11:00.219
- Noice.
- Noice.

11:00.254 --> 11:03.289
Noice!

11:03.323 --> 11:05.591
(both crying)

11:05.626 --> 11:10.097
(both) Noooice!

11:10.131 --> 11:13.133
(both crying)

11:13.167 --> 11:14.768
Noice!

11:14.802 --> 11:15.903
Noice!

11:15.937 --> 11:19.387
â™ª

11:23.978 --> 11:26.646
This is the fight
everybody's been waiting for,

11:26.680 --> 11:28.882
But when I get Andre
in the ring, man,

11:28.916 --> 11:31.952
It's gonna be cruel
and quick,

11:31.986 --> 11:35.021
'cause it's gonna be, like,
one-two, one-two, boom,

11:35.056 --> 11:36.123
and you out.

11:36.157 --> 11:38.324
Man, [bleep] you,
Claudius Lewis.

11:38.359 --> 11:40.460
I'm gonna [bleep] you
right in the ass.

11:40.494 --> 11:42.028
Yeah, I'm gonna
bend you over

11:42.062 --> 11:43.930
and [bleep] you
right in the ass[bleep].

11:43.964 --> 11:45.898
All right,
you know what?

11:45.933 --> 11:47.567
Andre, he like to be--

11:47.601 --> 11:49.468
try to get into
his opponents' heads

11:49.503 --> 11:50.569
by saying crazy stuff.

11:50.603 --> 11:51.837
He ain't gonna
Get into my head.

11:51.871 --> 11:53.005
He ain't gonna get
into my head.

11:53.039 --> 11:54.106
No, I'm not gonna
get in your head.

11:54.141 --> 11:55.241
I'm gonna
get in your ass[bleep]

11:55.275 --> 11:57.210
just like I said,
just right up in there

11:57.244 --> 11:59.646
in that tiny, little,
minuscule ass[bleep] of yours.

11:59.680 --> 12:00.947
This is what's gonna happen.

12:00.981 --> 12:02.181
I'm gonna take you
to a nice,

12:02.216 --> 12:04.717
high-fancy,
highfalutin restaurant,

12:04.752 --> 12:06.919
and I'm gonna buy you things,
wine and dine you.

12:06.954 --> 12:08.687
and we're gonna find some things
that we have in common,

12:08.722 --> 12:10.823
and they're gonna
become inside jokes to us.

12:10.857 --> 12:13.092
And then, we're just gonna
laugh about them in the taxi

12:13.126 --> 12:14.493
all the way
to your house,

12:14.528 --> 12:17.997
where I'm gonna [bleep] you
in the ass.

12:18.031 --> 12:20.432
Oh, okay, now, ju--

12:20.466 --> 12:23.336
just me p-personally,
I've never--

12:23.370 --> 12:25.538
You know,
I ain't ever seen Andre

12:25.572 --> 12:28.308
take it that far before,

12:28.342 --> 12:30.810
but--
(chuckles)

12:30.845 --> 12:31.978
What--whatever.

12:32.013 --> 12:33.613
Yeah, whatever.
I'll tell you whatever.

12:33.648 --> 12:35.215
Whatever, I'm gonna finally
gonna feel comfortable

12:35.249 --> 12:36.749
taking you out
to dinner parties.

12:36.783 --> 12:38.451
and then, all of our friends
who are also couples,

12:38.485 --> 12:39.919
they're just
gonna laugh at us

12:39.953 --> 12:42.321
'cause we're that couple
that holds hands all the time.

12:42.355 --> 12:43.422
And let me tell you something,
Claudius.

12:43.456 --> 12:45.491
We love each other
so very much

12:45.525 --> 12:47.093
that no matter
how tired I am,

12:47.127 --> 12:49.462
no matter how much bull[bleep]
I've dealt with over the day,

12:49.496 --> 12:50.563
I'm just gonna
leave it at the door

12:50.597 --> 12:51.964
when I [bleep] you
in the ass.

12:51.999 --> 12:53.232
Okay,
you know what, man?

12:53.267 --> 12:55.634
It's time for you to stop
all that nonsense

12:55.669 --> 12:57.836
right now, all right?

12:57.871 --> 13:00.038
Did he just say he was gonna
take me to dinner parties?

13:00.073 --> 13:02.908
He did say
"dinner parties."

13:02.942 --> 13:05.043
We're gonna snuggle
on the couch every night.

13:05.077 --> 13:06.411
I'm gonna let you
pick the movie,

13:06.446 --> 13:08.346
even though you always
pick the movie.

13:08.381 --> 13:10.715
Then I'm gonna take you out
for a walk on the beach,

13:10.750 --> 13:13.218
and the moonlight's
gonna bounce off of your scalp.

13:13.253 --> 13:15.388
And I'm just gonna kiss you
so tenderly

13:15.422 --> 13:18.391
While the waves break, and then
right there, right then,

13:18.425 --> 13:20.793
I'm gonna [bleep] you
in the sandy ass[bleep].

13:20.828 --> 13:22.595
All right, it's time for you
to shut your fool mouth!

13:22.630 --> 13:24.464
- Is it? Is it time?
- Yes, it is time.

13:24.498 --> 13:25.999
It's time for you
to shut your mouth!

13:26.033 --> 13:27.000
We gonna spend
the golden years together.

13:27.034 --> 13:28.001
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

13:28.035 --> 13:29.102
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

13:29.136 --> 13:30.336
I'm gonna support you
all the way

13:30.370 --> 13:32.071
through your run
through city council.

13:32.106 --> 13:33.439
Yeah, that's right,
and you're gonna be tired,

13:33.474 --> 13:35.108
and exhausted,
and overworked,

13:35.142 --> 13:36.409
But we're gonna
still find the energy

13:36.444 --> 13:38.111
- to go antiquing on the weekends.
- Oh, yeah?

13:38.145 --> 13:39.679
And then, you're gonna
be on your deathbed,

13:39.714 --> 13:40.847
and you're gonna
be sittin' there,

13:40.881 --> 13:41.948
and you're gonna be dyin'.

13:41.983 --> 13:42.983
And I'm gonna
be right beside you,

13:43.017 --> 13:44.117
and I'm gonna be cryin'.

13:44.151 --> 13:46.553
And right at that moment
when you cross over

13:46.587 --> 13:48.054
from this world
into the next,

13:48.089 --> 13:50.523
I'm gonna [bleep] you
in the ass[bleep].

13:50.557 --> 13:52.325
Oh, man,
I wish you'd try.

13:52.359 --> 13:53.526
- Oh, you do?
- I wish that you would try.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.728
Well,
wish [bleep]ing granted.

13:55.762 --> 13:57.997
(laughter)

13:58.031 --> 14:01.267
No, I love the Village
as much as the next guy,

14:01.301 --> 14:02.902
but I'm telling you,
if we continue

14:02.936 --> 14:05.738
to self-segregate ourselves,
The entire gay community's

14:05.772 --> 14:07.940
gonna continue
to be "margarine-ized"

14:07.975 --> 14:09.775
I was just saying this
to Claudius the other night

14:09.810 --> 14:11.276
right after I [bleep] him
in the ass.

14:11.311 --> 14:13.379
Yeah, he did,
he did.

14:13.413 --> 14:16.415
Anyway, enough politics.
Cheers, everyone.

14:19.712 --> 14:22.414
You know when people
pour their--their 40s

14:22.448 --> 14:23.849
for the--the memories
of their fallen homies?

14:23.883 --> 14:25.684
You pour--you pour it out
for your homies a little bit?

14:25.719 --> 14:28.720
Mm-hmm? could you pick
a more disreputable liquid?

14:28.755 --> 14:29.922
Yeah.

14:29.956 --> 14:32.157
You can urinate on a grave

14:32.192 --> 14:35.227
and be doing a better justice
to your fallen homey

14:35.262 --> 14:36.862
than some Olde English.

14:36.897 --> 14:38.431
Yeah, it seems like
the kind of thing

14:38.465 --> 14:41.200
that people in ancient times
would do to--

14:41.235 --> 14:44.303
to a fallen enemy,
not a--not a comrade.

14:44.337 --> 14:47.238
Let's get the--
the [bleep]iest ale.

14:47.273 --> 14:50.642
Oy, and--and take
this [bleep] piss water...

14:50.676 --> 14:53.178
Ah, ah.

14:53.212 --> 14:55.080
and dump it all over
these blasted Saxons.

14:55.114 --> 14:56.915
(both shout)

14:56.949 --> 14:58.350
Why do English people
always squat?

14:58.384 --> 15:00.085
I don't know why they do it,
but they do.

15:00.119 --> 15:01.786
- It's a fact, they squat.
- They squat.

15:01.821 --> 15:04.823
Those sons of bitches squat.

15:06.192 --> 15:09.461
Hey, y'all,
for real, though,

15:09.496 --> 15:10.963
- this right here...
- Yeah.

15:10.997 --> 15:14.400
This goes out
to all our fallen homies, yo.

15:14.434 --> 15:16.268
- Come on.
- Hey, yo, real talk.

15:16.303 --> 15:18.070
All right?

15:18.104 --> 15:23.576
(liquid splashing)

15:24.844 --> 15:27.814
I mean,

15:27.848 --> 15:30.349
it just seems like a waste.

15:30.384 --> 15:33.520
Right?

15:33.554 --> 15:36.457
Does that make me a [bleep]?

15:36.491 --> 15:38.025
Okay, I'm a [bleep].
Okay, I'm a [bleep].

15:38.060 --> 15:39.694
I'm sorry.
I'm a big ol' [bleep].

15:39.728 --> 15:42.196
- Let's go.
- I'm s--okay, here--

15:42.230 --> 15:44.999
For our homies.

15:51.708 --> 15:53.876
- Come on, man.
- Pour out your damn beer!

15:53.910 --> 15:56.912
Okay, okay, fine, fine.

16:00.750 --> 16:02.651
Glug, glug, glug.
Glug, glug, glug--

16:02.686 --> 16:04.253
No, come on, man.

16:04.287 --> 16:06.488
Hey, man, you got your thumb
in there, man.

16:06.522 --> 16:08.790
You need to respect
our homies.

16:08.825 --> 16:11.326
Jeez, okay.
Okay, okay.

16:11.361 --> 16:13.061
For the homies.

16:13.096 --> 16:15.164
- Wha--
- [bleep], a trash beer?

16:15.198 --> 16:18.434
What? come on--
Hey, beer is beer!

16:18.469 --> 16:20.903
The--Jeez, I cannot win
On this.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.572
- What?
- Fine.

16:22.606 --> 16:25.875
I'm not on board with this,
but I'll do it.

16:25.909 --> 16:29.678
(liquid splashing)

16:29.713 --> 16:31.079
Hey, man,
what you doin'?

16:31.114 --> 16:33.649
Oh--oh, really?
What, that--that don't count?

16:33.683 --> 16:35.618
Aw, hey, put that--
That's not for--

16:35.652 --> 16:36.986
Aw, man.

16:37.020 --> 16:38.187
(sighs)

16:38.221 --> 16:39.755
It's more of a symbol
than a gesture.

16:39.789 --> 16:41.657
Somebody back me up on that.
Right?

16:41.692 --> 16:44.027
Hey, man, that's
disrespectful right there.

16:44.061 --> 16:45.795
- You just do it.
- Fine.

16:45.829 --> 16:47.330
Fine!
I'll pour it out!

16:47.364 --> 16:50.366
I'll waste
the damn beer then!

16:56.173 --> 16:58.408
(groans)

16:58.442 --> 17:00.777
You know, i-I'm j--
I'm just not a waster.

17:00.812 --> 17:04.013
You know, I save everything.
Man, Jamal knows.

17:04.048 --> 17:06.316
If he eat a piece of pizza
and don't eat the crust,

17:06.349 --> 17:07.416
I eat the crust.

17:07.451 --> 17:09.685
If we do
a drive-by shooting,

17:09.720 --> 17:11.253
I will go back
for the shell cases.

17:11.288 --> 17:13.222
Not to hide
the evidence,

17:13.257 --> 17:15.992
but because you
can recycle those.

17:16.026 --> 17:18.928
They have value, man,
just like this beer.

17:18.962 --> 17:21.030
I can't waste nothin',
y'all.

17:21.064 --> 17:24.700
It's physically impossible
for me to waste this.

17:24.733 --> 17:27.536
I can't do it.

17:27.569 --> 17:31.574
Jamal, can you pour it out
for me?

17:34.979 --> 17:37.747
Oh, man.
Come on, man.

17:37.781 --> 17:38.748
I mean, it's not
gonna bring 'em back.

17:38.782 --> 17:39.916
Stupid.

17:39.950 --> 17:41.951
It's not
gonna bring 'em back.

17:49.833 --> 17:51.367
(groans)
All right, partner.

17:51.401 --> 17:53.535
Take this scumbag downtown

17:53.570 --> 17:56.404
before the Mexicans find him
and blow his ass away.

17:56.439 --> 17:59.407
We're gonna
keep you alive, Chico.
