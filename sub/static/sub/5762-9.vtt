00:00.670 --> 00:02.930
you konw don't even call this a short walk

00:02.940 --> 00:05.720
going for two miles next to the forest march

00:05.770 --> 00:07.450
All right,we go to the base camp

00:07.500 --> 00:08.420
i give you a nice massage

00:08.450 --> 00:10.450
Hey, how nice is nice

00:10.480 --> 00:12.610
how long would me marry you to get there?

00:13.370 --> 00:15.510
What¡¯s the man doing in our tent

00:17.130 --> 00:18.730
Who¡¯s that?

00:19.330 --> 00:20.470
I don't know.

00:20.510 --> 00:21.650
Wait a minute. Is she a¡ª

00:21.670 --> 00:23.440
no,she's not a ghost. She's real.

00:23.470 --> 00:24.320
She's a young girl.

00:24.360 --> 00:25.390
But doesn't she
look kind of--

00:25.400 --> 00:27.410
yeah. Something's not right.

00:27.580 --> 00:30.110
There's not another campsite for miles.

00:33.270 --> 00:34.580
Oh,we scared her.

00:34.620 --> 00:36.040
No,wait!

00:36.860 --> 00:38.100
Wait a minute!

Wait!

00:53.380 --> 00:54.810
We don't want to hurt you!

00:54.830 --> 00:56.270
We just want to help!

00:57.090 --> 00:58.310
Wait!
Don't--

01:00.120 --> 01:03.200
It's all right. Take it easy,ok?

01:03.380 --> 01:05.060
Let me see your leg. I'm a paramedic.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.390
I can help you.

01:06.630 --> 01:08.770
Let me just look at your leg,all right?

01:11.700 --> 01:12.530
It's nothing.

01:12.580 --> 01:14.810
It just needs to be cleaned and dressed.

01:15.830 --> 01:18.930
Hey,uh,tell us your name.

01:20.140 --> 01:22.220
You must be pretty scared,huh?

01:22.870 --> 01:25.250
Are you in these woods all alone?

01:28.330 --> 01:31.560
Tell you what. I'll make you a deal.

01:31.980 --> 01:34.590
You come back with us to our camp,ok?

01:34.630 --> 01:36.680
Get warm,have a good meal.

01:37.220 --> 01:39.540
I'll split this with you.

01:41.160 --> 01:43.150
Ok. You can have the whole thing.

01:46.880 --> 01:48.260
It's ok.

02:00.630 --> 02:01.710
It wasn't very deep at all.

02:01.740 --> 02:03.610
It should heal quickly.

02:04.220 --> 02:05.560
You know,we really want to help you,

02:05.590 --> 02:08.870
but you have to tell us
a few things first,like...

02:09.139 --> 02:10.889
what's your name?

02:13.150 --> 02:15.060
Where are your parents?

02:15.080 --> 02:16.850
Are you lost?

02:20.340 --> 02:23.130
Maybe if we talk to child services back in
town, they could give us some information-

02:23.140 --> 02:24.490
becca.

02:25.260 --> 02:28.410
- Your name's becca?
- yeah

02:28.760 --> 02:30.100
Ok.

02:30.550 --> 02:32.140
Becca,so...

02:32.330 --> 02:33.190
what are you doing here?

02:33.220 --> 02:34.820
Are you hiding from something?

02:34.850 --> 02:36.270
I ran away.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.320
What did you run away from?

02:39.660 --> 02:40.790
Your parents?

02:40.820 --> 02:42.720
I don't have any parents.

02:42.970 --> 02:44.640
They're dead.

02:45.020 --> 02:47.010
Do you live in a foster home?

02:48.720 --> 02:51.060
How long have you been out here?

02:53.740 --> 02:54.690
2 or 3 weeks.

02:54.720 --> 02:56.470
We need to find out
where that foster home was

02:56.490 --> 02:58.020
so that we can let them
know you're all right.

02:58.070 --> 02:59.230
No.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.710
Please. I don't want to go back there.

03:03.010 --> 03:05.150
Well,we're going to do the
best we can to keep you safe,

03:05.200 --> 03:07.290
but we need to let the
police know that we found you.

03:07.340 --> 03:09.760
Don't make me go back there.

03:10.270 --> 03:12.150
I'm begging you.

03:15.270 --> 03:17.230
You know,we don't get
any cell service out here,

03:17.260 --> 03:20.860
and if we try to hike to the car,it
would be dark before we get there,so...

03:20.900 --> 03:21.890
ok.

03:23.940 --> 03:26.040
You're going to stay here with us.

03:26.910 --> 03:29.000
We'll keep you safe.

04:01.980 --> 04:03.940
I won't let you leave me.

04:07.110 --> 04:08.630
What's going on?

04:08.790 --> 04:10.330
What's happening to me?

04:13.490 --> 04:16.769
hey, look at me, There's nothing here.

04:16.810 --> 04:18.339
You're all right.

04:21.149 --> 04:22.600
She's mine.

05:09.110 --> 05:11.830
Becca,I know that you
don't really feel safe,

05:11.860 --> 05:14.890
but trust me,you are.

05:15.960 --> 05:19.390
I think the best thing for you is
just to get a good night's sleep.

05:19.770 --> 05:21.180
I can'T.

05:24.700 --> 05:25.940
Well,then,let's talk.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.420
Do I have to?

05:31.880 --> 05:34.690
I know that this is
going to sound strange...

05:36.050 --> 05:38.720
but have you lost any
friends or family lately?

05:38.770 --> 05:39.830
Why?

05:39.870 --> 05:42.120
I'm just trying to understand
why you're out here.

05:42.150 --> 05:43.290
They hurt me. I left.

05:43.330 --> 05:44.630
I'm not going back.

05:44.680 --> 05:45.940
Ok.

05:47.570 --> 05:49.770
Why these woods?

05:50.510 --> 05:54.540
How have you been living out
here all this time by yourself?

05:55.640 --> 05:57.060
I'm tired.

05:57.110 --> 05:59.120
I'm going to go back to sleep.

06:03.440 --> 06:08.390
Wait. Um,can you hang with me for a
minute,just till I fall back asleep?

06:09.470 --> 06:11.330
Of course I will.

06:24.580 --> 06:28.600
Hey,I didn't know you were so
good with teenage hard cases.

06:28.630 --> 06:31.580
Well,it helps that I used to be one.

06:31.620 --> 06:33.110
You? Come on.

06:33.140 --> 06:34.920
Yeah. You remember that age.

06:34.970 --> 06:38.510
You're always mad at your parents 'cause
they didn't understand who you were.

06:38.540 --> 06:41.890
Well,take all that,add ghosts,and stir.

06:42.370 --> 06:44.450
Do you think that's
what happened to becca?

06:44.500 --> 06:47.550
Or maybe she was abused?

06:47.610 --> 06:48.550
I don't know.

06:48.600 --> 06:49.840
What did the ghost say about her?

06:49.910 --> 06:51.870
He just said "she's mine."

06:51.910 --> 06:55.320
Well,maybe he could be a friend
or a brother who was also abused.

06:55.360 --> 06:56.660
Could be.

06:57.240 --> 07:00.740
Well,I guess we'll find out
when we know where she belongs.

07:00.790 --> 07:04.430
What if we're just taking her right
back to the thing she's running from?

07:04.490 --> 07:06.080
Don't really have a choice.

07:14.650 --> 07:15.590
Honey.

07:15.630 --> 07:17.450
No. Wake up.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.150
Becca's gone.

07:19.180 --> 07:20.420
What?

07:26.260 --> 07:27.660
I left this in my backpack.

07:27.690 --> 07:28.960
She must have found it in the tent.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.270
Ok. So where could she have gone?

07:30.330 --> 07:31.820
I don't know. Wherever
she went,she's staying,

07:31.830 --> 07:34.000
'cause she took most of the food.

07:35.180 --> 07:35.960
Oh,no.

07:35.990 --> 07:36.820
What?

07:36.870 --> 07:38.480
My car keys.

07:38.510 --> 07:39.880
What?

07:44.240 --> 07:45.400
Becca

07:49.940 --> 07:51.750
Just watch out. She
might get some traction.

07:51.780 --> 07:53.230
Becca!

07:53.610 --> 07:54.660
Becca,stop it!

07:54.680 --> 07:56.500
i'll try get this side

07:59.120 --> 08:00.770
You can't go. I need you!

08:00.810 --> 08:02.780
I won't let you go!

08:03.680 --> 08:05.220
Go away!

08:05.410 --> 08:06.920
Leave her alone!

08:08.930 --> 08:11.040
Get out of the
car-- right now.

08:11.070 --> 08:12.330
Get out of the car.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.210
You could have killed yourself.

08:14.230 --> 08:16.010
What were you thinking?

08:17.090 --> 08:18.520
You saw him,too.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.520
You can see ghosts.

08:28.990 --> 08:32.870
So,we'll go downtown later and see if
we can get some things that fit better.

08:32.909 --> 08:35.140
So you're not going to
call the police or whoever?

08:35.169 --> 08:38.510
Eventually,but if you need
some more time,for now...

08:40.059 --> 08:41.070
do you need some help with that?

08:41.100 --> 08:42.980
I know how to use a brush.

08:48.820 --> 08:52.250
You know,when my grandma first
told me that she could see ghosts,

08:52.280 --> 08:54.490
I should have said,"thank god.

08:54.520 --> 08:57.250
You know,there's finally
someone else like me."

08:57.930 --> 09:00.960
All I could say was,"what
is wrong with my grandma?"

09:04.240 --> 09:06.870
It might be something
you have to get used to.

09:08.370 --> 09:11.070
So,you said that you
were hurt by people.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.840
Mostly with words?

09:13.420 --> 09:14.900
Yeah,mostly.

09:16.610 --> 09:17.590
Who?

09:17.630 --> 09:19.680
My foster parents.

09:21.690 --> 09:24.060
What happened to your real parents?

09:24.490 --> 09:26.830
They died in a car crash.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.630
How old were you when they died?

09:30.640 --> 09:33.190
I guess I was,like,5 or 6.

09:33.410 --> 09:35.560
How old were you when
you started seeing ghosts?

09:35.600 --> 09:37.970
I don't remember ever not seeing them.

09:39.370 --> 09:41.510
What did you say to your
parents after they died?

09:41.540 --> 09:43.240
After they died?

09:45.960 --> 09:47.780
I never saw them.

09:51.380 --> 09:53.120
Your parents didn't die,did they?

09:53.160 --> 09:54.710
And you don't have foster parents.

09:54.770 --> 09:56.420
You made it all up.

10:01.110 --> 10:03.720
Look,you can tell me the truth.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.310
If you do,I can help you.

10:10.310 --> 10:13.150
And if you don't,then you're going to
go back home, and nothing's going to be--

10:13.170 --> 10:15.320
they think I'm sick.

10:15.460 --> 10:18.880
They take me to the doctors and
they try to make me take pills.

10:18.920 --> 10:22.060
Ok. So then,we'll make them understand.

10:22.090 --> 10:24.010
It won't work.

10:24.070 --> 10:29.490
Well,you can't live in the woods
forever,and you don't have to.

10:29.510 --> 10:31.010
Know how to make the ghosts go away?

10:31.020 --> 10:32.750
I know something better.

10:32.780 --> 10:34.920
Yeah,mom. I'm fine. I promise.

10:35.620 --> 10:37.190
I don't know. Just,like,some
cuts and stuff,

10:37.220 --> 10:40.090
but he's,like,an ambulance
guy,and he says I'm fine. So...

10:40.600 --> 10:41.620
yeah,I know.

10:41.640 --> 10:42.810
I'm sorry.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.590
They'll be here tomorrow afternoon.

10:44.630 --> 10:47.300
They live in a small
town outside st.Louis.

10:48.510 --> 10:50.270
Well,what happens now?

10:50.310 --> 10:52.330
Well,they just talked
to the grandview police,

10:52.370 --> 10:54.170
who said nice things
about us,thank goodness,

10:54.210 --> 10:57.060
so I guess she'll stay
here until they get here.

10:57.130 --> 10:58.740
How did she get that far from home?

10:58.780 --> 11:00.030
'Cause she's a smart girl.

11:00.070 --> 11:03.320
She took a bus 5 or 6 days and
then got off here in grandview.

11:03.350 --> 11:04.890
Ok. And how
about this--

11:04.910 --> 11:07.700
another person who sees
ghosts chooses grandview.

11:07.730 --> 11:08.940
Why does that keep happening?

11:08.970 --> 11:10.930
I don't know,but I don't
have time to think about it.

11:10.960 --> 11:12.560
Right,'cause you got
a ghost to cross over.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.360
No.She does.

11:14.890 --> 11:18.560
I have 24 hours to teach
that girl everything I know.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.990
has you benn in a touch since you left home?

11:42.020 --> 11:43.780
no*******

11:43.830 --> 11:48.650
But the thing to remember is that
they're more scared and confused than you.

11:48.790 --> 11:52.750
They're stuck here,for some reason,and
most of the time,they don't even know why.

11:55.760 --> 11:59.320
and after you've figured out
why they've stayed earthbound,

11:59.520 --> 12:02.360
you can help them,take care of them.

12:02.590 --> 12:04.290
And they can cross over.

12:05.190 --> 12:06.080
Cross over?

12:06.130 --> 12:08.380
Yeah. Into the light.

12:08.430 --> 12:09.870
So,how do you know it's a better place?

12:09.930 --> 12:10.980
You ever been there?

12:11.000 --> 12:12.720
No,but I've felt it.

12:12.750 --> 12:16.500
There's peace there,and knowing that I
gave them that,there's nothing better.

12:16.540 --> 12:18.440
Hey. You must be becca.

12:18.470 --> 12:19.880
I'm delia.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.850
It's ok,honey. I won't bite.

12:22.810 --> 12:25.450
I hear that you are a very special girl.

12:25.630 --> 12:28.000
Uh,you know what? There's some really
cool vintage dresses over there.

12:28.030 --> 12:29.740
Why don't you take a look?

12:31.270 --> 12:34.830
Melinda,you know that I believe
that you do amazing things.

12:34.860 --> 12:37.850
I have seen you change
people's lives again and again.

12:37.900 --> 12:39.350
- But this--
- what?

12:39.380 --> 12:41.170
Do you really think the
best way to help this girl--

12:41.200 --> 12:43.990
Is to give her a crash
course in being you?

12:44.030 --> 12:46.230
Delia,she's not just running
away from her parents.

12:46.260 --> 12:48.060
She's running away from ghosts.

12:48.080 --> 12:50.190
Can't you teach her
how not to be afraid?

12:50.220 --> 12:52.010
I can't stop her from seeing them,

12:52.020 --> 12:55.600
which means that I can't stop them
from going to her with their problems.

12:55.630 --> 12:58.600
Have you ever tried walking around with
a crowd of dead people following you?

12:58.620 --> 12:59.400
It's not fun.

12:59.430 --> 13:01.870
Didn't you say your mom had
this gift,and she lived with it?

13:01.890 --> 13:03.420
Trust me,that is not a good argument.

13:03.450 --> 13:04.240
Melinda?

13:04.280 --> 13:05.920
Yeah. I'll be right there.

13:06.950 --> 13:08.730
Look,I had my grandmother,ok?

13:08.750 --> 13:11.640
Becca has no one but
parents who don't understand.

13:11.650 --> 13:13.870
I have to teach her
how to cross them over.

13:13.910 --> 13:15.430
I'm not going to let her
turn out like gabriel¡ª

13:15.440 --> 13:17.850
overmedicated and institutionalized.

13:24.350 --> 13:25.610
Becca!

13:26.450 --> 13:28.500
Look,I'm sorry,ok?

13:28.540 --> 13:30.530
I know that this is hard.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.740
You don't have to apologize.

13:32.970 --> 13:34.600
I should be used to seeing them.

13:34.630 --> 13:36.650
You have to stop running away from them,

13:36.690 --> 13:38.140
else they're going to keep finding you.

13:38.180 --> 13:39.840
You think I don't know that?

13:40.610 --> 13:43.160
Look,that's why you
have to face them,ok?

13:43.200 --> 13:44.480
You just have to find
out what they need.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.520
It will make them stop.

13:47.390 --> 13:49.820
Ok. I'll try.

13:50.680 --> 13:52.550
Let's start with his name.

13:52.580 --> 13:54.150
Did he give you that?

13:55.700 --> 13:57.050
I think it's daniel.

13:57.090 --> 13:59.770
Has he said anything about how he died?

13:59.810 --> 14:02.430
Um,I think he was in
some kind of accident.

14:02.460 --> 14:03.880
He said there were bodies around.

14:03.910 --> 14:06.450
Was there a fire? 'Cause he
looked e'like hd been burned.

14:06.470 --> 14:08.540
Honestly,I try not to look.

14:08.580 --> 14:10.230
He talked about that,too.

14:10.280 --> 14:12.920
Ok. I see it a little bit,but
for her to be your mini-me,

14:12.950 --> 14:14.300
her hair would have
to be a lot different.

14:14.330 --> 14:15.860
This is my friend rick payne.

14:15.890 --> 14:17.390
He's a professor.
He's also--

14:17.420 --> 14:18.870
oh,my gosh! Those eyes!

14:18.890 --> 14:21.000
Look at those eyes with that
"don't even try lying to me,

14:21.030 --> 14:23.000
'cause I can literally see
right through you" look!

14:23.030 --> 14:24.340
- A little strange?
- Yes.

14:24.360 --> 14:25.490
The resemblance is uncanny.

14:25.500 --> 14:26.910
Ok. The ghost.

14:26.920 --> 14:28.850
He's a boy,about becca's
age. His name is daniel.

14:28.890 --> 14:30.280
There was an accident in the woods.

14:30.290 --> 14:31.990
There were lots of bodies
around,so I'm thinking...

14:32.020 --> 14:33.290
last year plane crash.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.890
Yeah,he probably wandered off, got
separated from the rest of the passengers.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.580
Yeah. The woods are not
far from the crash site.

14:37.610 --> 14:38.720
Well,that would explain the bodies.

14:38.750 --> 14:39.960
And the burns on his face.

14:39.990 --> 14:41.250
Ok.Well,I'll check the manifest.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.470
I'll see if his name turns up.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.050
What about the voices?

14:44.080 --> 14:44.970
What voices?

14:45.000 --> 14:46.680
In your basement.

14:46.910 --> 14:48.110
Didn't you hear them?

14:48.160 --> 14:49.240
No,not really.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.380
Wait a minute. You can hear
voices that melinda can't?

14:52.390 --> 14:54.180
That would make her
more powerful than you.

14:54.230 --> 14:55.540
No. That's just how it works.

14:55.570 --> 14:56.810
In the beginning,you get everything¡ª

14:56.840 --> 14:58.770
you get voices,ghost energy,all of it.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.870
And then,eventually,you learn to tune
certain things out so you can function.

15:01.900 --> 15:03.830
Whatever she's hearing,it's
probably coming from the tunnels.

15:03.850 --> 15:06.190
Do you still have that giant
hole in the wall in your basement?

15:06.230 --> 15:07.420
What tunnels?

15:07.440 --> 15:09.060
Oh,you don't want to
know about the tunnels.

15:09.100 --> 15:10.700
Well,why not? What's under there?

15:10.730 --> 15:12.510
What's under there? More
like who's under there.

15:12.540 --> 15:14.440
More accurately,who isn't under there.

15:14.470 --> 15:15.620
The amount of
trapped souls--

15:15.630 --> 15:16.580
ok. You know what?

15:16.600 --> 15:21.080
Maybe she should focus on the ghost that's
haunting her right now,don't you think?

15:21.200 --> 15:23.340
Yeah,ok--yes.
I do.

15:23.450 --> 15:24.330
What's my job again?

15:24.380 --> 15:25.950
Check the plane manifest.

15:25.990 --> 15:27.120
Ok.

15:28.850 --> 15:31.550
You and I have a field trip to go on.

15:40.490 --> 15:42.700
come on,Let's go find daniel.

15:42.760 --> 15:43.570
Why?

15:43.610 --> 15:46.720
Because this is probably
near where he died.

15:46.750 --> 15:48.730
It will help him remember what happened.

15:48.810 --> 15:50.470
But why look for him at all?

15:50.490 --> 15:52.360
I mean,he hasn't bugged me
in hours. Maybe he's finished.

15:52.390 --> 15:54.660
No,he's not finished
until he crosses over--

15:54.680 --> 15:56.200
until we help him cross over.

15:56.230 --> 15:58.160
How many times did I tell you?

15:58.190 --> 15:59.910
I don't like being left behind!

15:59.950 --> 16:01.590
Becca,talk to him.

16:01.650 --> 16:02.500
Find out what he needs.

16:02.540 --> 16:03.910
Please,don't go.

16:03.960 --> 16:05.110
Ask him what's keeping him here.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.450
Why won't you just leave me alone?

16:07.480 --> 16:08.740
They left me here.

16:08.770 --> 16:10.790
They never said a word!

16:10.820 --> 16:11.670
Were they punishing me?

16:11.700 --> 16:13.320
What was I supposed to think?

16:13.360 --> 16:15.810
Who? Daniel,who left you here?

16:15.840 --> 16:17.020
Who is she,anyway?

16:17.060 --> 16:18.580
I don't like her.

16:18.700 --> 16:20.510
Becca,find out what's keeping him here.

16:20.560 --> 16:21.980
I don't care.

16:22.790 --> 16:25.910
I hate him! I want him to go away!

16:34.460 --> 16:35.930
i'm burning

16:37.770 --> 16:39.420
Hey,what do you see?

16:39.670 --> 16:41.090
Daniel,talk to me,all right?

16:41.110 --> 16:42.880
I want to help you.
She wants to help you!

16:42.910 --> 16:44.790
She doesn't want to help me!

16:45.470 --> 16:46.510
Why should I help her?

16:46.560 --> 16:47.810
Well,then,stop hurting her,all right?

16:47.830 --> 16:49.320
Let her go.

16:50.290 --> 16:51.490
Hey.

16:52.110 --> 16:53.080
What happened?

16:53.130 --> 16:54.900
I was on fire!

16:55.220 --> 16:56.520
It was horrible.

16:57.230 --> 16:59.680
Look,I know how painful this is,ok?

16:59.900 --> 17:01.270
But look at me.

17:01.350 --> 17:03.530
I'm right here. We're ok.

17:04.740 --> 17:07.599
There's a reason that he
told you all of that. Ok?

17:07.630 --> 17:09.290
He was trying to tell
you what happened to him,

17:09.329 --> 17:11.579
and with that,you can cross him over.

17:11.619 --> 17:12.420
I don't care.

17:12.460 --> 17:13.359
Yes,you do.

17:13.390 --> 17:15.200
You want to help him and yourself.

17:15.210 --> 17:17.660
I don't care about
daniel or any of them!

17:17.700 --> 17:19.240
You can't give up.

17:19.290 --> 17:21.040
Yes,I can!

17:21.079 --> 17:22.220
I'm done.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.329
I'm never going to do that again.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.180
Still not hungry?

17:45.670 --> 17:47.610
You know,your parents are
going to be here tomorrow,

17:47.650 --> 17:50.080
so we don't really have much time.

17:53.370 --> 17:56.410
Has a ghost ever done
anything like this to you?

17:58.920 --> 18:01.250
I've seen weird things before.

18:01.270 --> 18:03.190
No one's ever tried to hurt me.

18:03.230 --> 18:05.580
I know how awful this is.

18:05.800 --> 18:07.850
But the vision,it'S...

18:08.060 --> 18:10.680
sometimes the only way they can
tell you that they need your help.

18:10.710 --> 18:14.320
But why should i help daniel when
all he tries to do is scare me?

18:15.280 --> 18:21.190
Look... I know that this is not fair.

18:22.110 --> 18:25.930
Most kids don't have to think about
death until they're much older.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.790
But you and me?

18:29.000 --> 18:30.920
Our lives are different.

18:32.060 --> 18:34.850
You want a reason why
you should help daniel?

18:35.330 --> 18:39.100
One is because if you
don't,he'll never leave you alone.

18:40.060 --> 18:42.920
But the real reason is because you can.

18:44.240 --> 18:45.900
Ok.

18:46.490 --> 18:48.020
But how?

18:48.050 --> 18:49.710
The vision.

18:50.840 --> 18:53.100
Tell me everything you saw.

19:05.740 --> 19:07.930
There were bodies on the ground.

19:08.500 --> 19:09.940
I'm right here.

19:10.370 --> 19:11.990
I was on fire.

19:13.020 --> 19:14.890
You mean daniel was.

19:17.560 --> 19:20.210
At first,his skin hurt really bad.

19:20.710 --> 19:23.080
Then,he couldn't feel anything.

19:27.940 --> 19:30.050
There was metal burning.

19:31.350 --> 19:33.210
And tires.

19:33.670 --> 19:35.690
And there were cars.

19:35.760 --> 19:39.060
They looked like tinfoil
somebody punched really hard.

19:40.820 --> 19:43.050
One of them was on fire.

19:43.590 --> 19:45.470
I think that one was daniel'S.

19:45.500 --> 19:48.040
Can you see a license plate number?

19:48.870 --> 19:51.980
There were
letters. M-l-Y...

19:52.940 --> 19:54.880
the number 8.

20:01.320 --> 20:02.620
Hey...

20:03.480 --> 20:05.140
becca.

20:05.690 --> 20:08.070
No. You did great.

20:09.330 --> 20:11.780
You know what? Let's get out of here.

20:12.000 --> 20:12.960
What do you think?

20:12.990 --> 20:14.050
Let's go...

20:14.090 --> 20:16.160
walk amongst the living
for a little while.

20:16.190 --> 20:18.010
Can I just be alone?

20:19.780 --> 20:21.200
Sure.

20:22.170 --> 20:23.930
Hey,melinda?

20:27.740 --> 20:30.040
Were you ever scared?

20:31.820 --> 20:33.840
It's never been easy.

20:34.930 --> 20:39.080
But I had someone
who...made me feel brave.

20:40.280 --> 20:43.050
I hope I can do that same thing for you.

20:45.530 --> 20:46.490
Hey.

20:46.530 --> 20:48.290
How'd the open house
for the new listing go?

20:48.330 --> 20:51.640
Oh,people loved the cookies,but
not bites on the house.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.350
I brought leftovers.

20:53.360 --> 20:54.990
Thanks for covering.

20:55.590 --> 20:56.270
Where's becca?

20:56.320 --> 20:57.420
She's at home resting.

20:57.460 --> 20:58.550
Jim's there.

20:58.590 --> 20:59.550
How's she doing?

20:59.590 --> 21:00.920
We made some progress.

21:00.930 --> 21:03.090
I think I know who the
little boy in the woods is.

21:03.140 --> 21:04.880
He's looking for his parents.

21:04.900 --> 21:07.180
2 cars hit
head-on,causing a pile-up.

21:07.210 --> 21:09.340
There were 5
fatalities,including a family¡ª

21:09.370 --> 21:11.700
becca had seen their
license plate in a vision¡ª

21:11.710 --> 21:14.900
a mother,father,and a 13-year-old
boy named daniel asher.

21:14.950 --> 21:15.650
That's terrible.

21:15.680 --> 21:16.730
Daniel died at the scene.

21:16.770 --> 21:18.610
And his parents died
later at the hospital.

21:18.660 --> 21:20.720
You know,maybe they just saw
the light and went right into it.

21:20.740 --> 21:22.730
And he's just been
waiting there ever since?

21:22.760 --> 21:24.240
He thinks they're still alive?

21:24.290 --> 21:25.580
I'm not sure.

21:25.630 --> 21:29.270
But he needs to know that they've
gone,and he should join them.

21:29.300 --> 21:31.580
With any luck,becca will be
able to convince him of that.

21:31.610 --> 21:32.630
It would really help them both.

21:32.660 --> 21:34.860
You know what? I really have to go.

21:41.120 --> 21:41.910
Hey.

21:41.940 --> 21:42.970
You're back!

21:43.000 --> 21:44.240
That's so great.

21:44.280 --> 21:46.470
Um,you could come meet my parents.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.870
So,I was telling them all
about how you helped me.

21:48.910 --> 21:51.220
Now,I admit that I was just
pretending to see ghosts,

21:51.240 --> 21:53.580
just like you did when you
were my age for attention.

21:53.630 --> 21:56.820
Melinda. I'm joan cahill,becca's mom.

21:56.860 --> 21:58.250
I don't even know what to say.

21:58.290 --> 22:00.120
Honestly,I don't,either.

22:00.150 --> 22:03.050
Honey,the cahills were able
to get an earlier flight.

22:03.100 --> 22:04.500
Um,this is tony.

22:04.540 --> 22:05.820
Tony,this is my wife melinda.

22:05.870 --> 22:09.710
Thank you for saving our daughter--
our whole family,actually.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.740
Well,I don't know if I really helped.

22:11.760 --> 22:13.060
You did.

22:13.280 --> 22:15.830
Look,I don't know how
you got through to her,

22:15.870 --> 22:20.920
but these things that she was
imagining,we didn't know what to do.

22:20.950 --> 22:24.770
Frankly,I felt like we'd lost
her long before she ran away.

22:25.180 --> 22:29.230
But...you're back now. Right,sweetheart?

22:29.410 --> 22:31.170
Things are going to be a-ok.

22:32.930 --> 22:36.230
Yeah. A-ok,again.

22:44.940 --> 22:46.170
Thanks for not busting me.

22:46.220 --> 22:48.190
So,what are you going to do now?

22:48.480 --> 22:51.470
Every time you see a
ghost,just ignore it?

22:51.840 --> 22:53.110
Kind of already tried that.

22:53.150 --> 22:55.200
- Yeah,but it will be easier now.
- How?

22:55.220 --> 22:57.170
'Cause I know it's not my fault.

22:57.190 --> 22:58.860
Before,I thought I had
something bad in me.

22:58.900 --> 23:00.970
I was making them come
to me and nobody else.

23:00.990 --> 23:03.720
They come to you
because you can see them.

23:04.100 --> 23:06.740
And because they need your help.

23:07.010 --> 23:09.630
Look,this is who you really are.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.760
It's who we both are.

23:14.290 --> 23:15.780
No.

23:16.780 --> 23:18.920
I'm not brave enough.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.100
You comfortable,sweetie?

23:39.050 --> 23:41.590
You can't hear a word
I'm saying,can you?

23:50.270 --> 23:53.440
I could sleep for about
100 years,you know?

23:53.810 --> 23:55.400
Should we try to get a
later flight tomorrow?

23:55.450 --> 23:58.070
No. Let's get home.

23:59.580 --> 24:02.120
Thank god,we can throw these away now.

24:02.990 --> 24:06.170
What were we doing,making
her take these?

24:08.700 --> 24:09.990
Joan,wait...

24:10.990 --> 24:13.000
she wasn't hallucinating.

24:13.050 --> 24:15.110
She never actually saw anything.

24:15.150 --> 24:19.030
I know. I hope it's
over,but just in case...

24:28.640 --> 24:30.960
it's not just about becca.

24:31.260 --> 24:35.310
It's about that little boy in the woods
waiting on parents that will never come back.

24:35.340 --> 24:37.070
Yeah,but becca knows
about the light now.

24:37.100 --> 24:39.420
So maybe she's able to help him.

24:40.030 --> 24:41.470
And he knows about you.

24:41.510 --> 24:42.800
He can come to you.

24:42.840 --> 24:45.700
And what about the ghost
that haunts her after that?

24:46.020 --> 24:47.410
And then,the one after that?

24:47.460 --> 24:50.590
Honey,no one could have
helped her more than you did.

24:51.190 --> 24:52.730
Yeah.

24:54.400 --> 24:56.540
That's what kills me.

25:23.220 --> 25:25.170
No. Get away from them.

25:33.120 --> 25:36.380
I'd give anything just to
be with my parents again.

25:45.160 --> 25:48.040
Oh! No,no. Why can't
you just leave me alone?

25:48.070 --> 25:50.270
Because then I'd be alone,too.

25:50.600 --> 25:52.900
How'd you like it if I left
you in the dark in those woods?

25:52.930 --> 25:54.060
I begged you to.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.670
But you didn't mean it.

25:56.210 --> 25:57.760
Why can't you just be my friend?

25:57.810 --> 25:59.130
Because you're dead!

25:59.190 --> 26:02.490
You'd be dead,too,if I didn't
help you find food and water.

26:02.650 --> 26:03.810
I looked out for you.

26:03.850 --> 26:06.610
Every night,I was there,and you knew it.

26:06.650 --> 26:10.000
Ok. Fine. You watched over me. Thanks.

26:10.020 --> 26:11.420
Now,go,please.

26:11.460 --> 26:13.070
I'm still protecting you.

26:13.100 --> 26:14.010
What's that supposed to mean?

26:14.040 --> 26:16.730
Someone knows about you
and your friend. That lady.

26:16.770 --> 26:19.400
- He found me,and he'll find you,too.
- Who?

26:19.440 --> 26:20.510
I'm not sure.

26:20.550 --> 26:23.290
He wanted me to come
with him,but I wouldn'T.

26:23.510 --> 26:27.750
He said he knows where
they're keeping my parents.

26:28.080 --> 26:29.340
I don't understand.

26:29.370 --> 26:30.930
Melinda knows things.
You should go to her.

26:30.980 --> 26:35.040
No. She just wants to send me away
so I'll never see my parents again.

26:36.260 --> 26:37.600
Becca...

26:38.670 --> 26:40.410
please.

26:41.750 --> 26:45.360
You have to help me. only you hear voices

26:45.400 --> 26:46.760
Why don't you let me finish that up,huh?

26:46.810 --> 26:47.840
Go on up.

26:51.120 --> 26:52.360
that's weird

26:55.820 --> 26:57.630
- Hey.
- We are so sorry to bother you.

26:57.670 --> 26:59.240
Is becca here?

26:59.310 --> 27:00.530
Please tell us she's here.

27:00.560 --> 27:02.080
No,she's not.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.490
Oh,god.

27:03.560 --> 27:05.070
When was the last time
you saw your daughter?

27:05.110 --> 27:07.410
Um,we were tired. We fell asleep.

27:07.440 --> 27:09.140
Probably 3 hours ago.

27:09.180 --> 27:10.180
We already called the police.

27:10.200 --> 27:12.210
I woke up freezing.

27:12.260 --> 27:15.290
It always seemed so cold
right before I hear her scream.

27:15.320 --> 27:16.650
Becca gets night terrors.

27:16.680 --> 27:19.800
And this time,she didn't
call out. She was just gone.

27:23.680 --> 27:26.040
becca say anything? Was
she talking to anyone?

27:26.070 --> 27:28.140
I heard her whisper something.

27:28.170 --> 27:29.090
She went into the bathroom.

27:29.130 --> 27:31.190
She does that sometimes when
she's trying to hide from us.

27:31.240 --> 27:32.530
Yeah,but does she say anything?

27:32.570 --> 27:35.800
I buried my head in the
pillow. I couldn't listen.

27:35.830 --> 27:37.950
Ok. She was probably talking to daniel.

27:37.980 --> 27:40.380
And if she went with him,then
she's trying to cross him.

27:40.410 --> 27:41.360
I'm sorry. Cross him?

27:41.400 --> 27:42.620
Just take them to the police,all right?

27:42.650 --> 27:44.120
- I'm going to go to the woods.
- You got it.

27:44.140 --> 27:46.210
Excuse me. What the hell is going on?

27:46.260 --> 27:48.290
You know what? I'm really sorry
to have to throw this at you,

27:48.320 --> 27:51.070
but your daughter's been
trying to tell you for years.

27:51.120 --> 27:52.680
You've tried pills.
You've tried doctors.

27:52.710 --> 27:55.790
The only thing you 2 never
tried was believing her.

27:57.260 --> 27:59.900
Your daughter sees ghosts,ok?

28:01.670 --> 28:04.540
And I know that because I see them,too.

28:11.440 --> 28:14.400
Look,you both have to understand
that my wife has lived her entire life

28:14.420 --> 28:16.740
having people tell her she's crazy.

28:17.340 --> 28:20.250
And maybe right now,you
think she is,too.

28:21.450 --> 28:25.230
But I'll tell you,she's the only chance
you have of getting your daughter back.

28:47.230 --> 28:49.080
You can hear it too,right?

28:49.230 --> 28:51.990
This is where melinda
said the trapped souls are.

28:54.870 --> 28:56.680
It sounds like they're hurting.

28:56.740 --> 28:58.350
That's why we have to hurry.

29:08.960 --> 29:09.940
Hello?

29:09.980 --> 29:11.090
This is guardian-safe.

29:11.130 --> 29:13.620
There's been an alarm activation
at your place of business.

29:13.650 --> 29:16.050
Would you like us to
dispatch the police?

29:16.210 --> 29:17.660
The tunnels.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.380
Sorry,ma'am,I didn't hear you.

29:19.440 --> 29:21.410
Would you like us to
dispatch the police?

29:21.450 --> 29:23.840
No,no,no. It's my husband.

29:23.910 --> 29:25.580
Sometimes he forgets
how the alarm works.

29:25.630 --> 29:27.470
I'm so sorry. Thank you.

29:30.950 --> 29:32.900
What? What?

29:36.310 --> 29:38.100
- What?
- Hey.

29:38.150 --> 29:40.800
In the square this afternoon,when
you told becca about the tunnels,

29:40.810 --> 29:43.390
didn't you tell her that she could
get to them through the basement?

29:43.420 --> 29:45.540
Oh,gee whiz. You know,I really
thought there was going to be a

29:45.560 --> 29:48.210
"sorry I woke you
up,professor" mixed in there.

29:48.230 --> 29:49.210
She's in trouble,ok?

29:49.230 --> 29:52.390
She ran away from her parents after
they heard her talking to someone.

29:52.400 --> 29:53.400
Was it the ghost daniel?

29:53.440 --> 29:55.210
No,room service.

29:55.240 --> 29:58.940
Well,we know she heard us talking about
the hole in the wall in your basement.

29:58.980 --> 30:00.490
But why would they go into the tunnels?

30:00.520 --> 30:02.280
Because you told her that there
were spirits trapped there.

30:02.310 --> 30:04.490
Maybe she and daniel think it's
the best way to get to his parents.

30:04.540 --> 30:06.270
And by the way,the store
alarm just went off.

30:06.290 --> 30:09.820
- Oh,boy. Sounds like daniel's up to his old tricks again.
- What?

30:09.850 --> 30:13.650
Remember,you asked me to
read up on the accident?

30:13.680 --> 30:16.910
Well,the post mortem report says
that that kid's blood alcohol level

30:16.950 --> 30:19.100
was a few notches above schnockered.

30:19.150 --> 30:20.530
So,he was drunk?

30:20.550 --> 30:21.540
Very.

30:34.140 --> 30:36.140
I think your parents are down there.

30:37.470 --> 30:40.070
Look,if you're scared,you
don't have to do this.

30:40.090 --> 30:41.460
You can just go.

30:44.300 --> 30:45.950
I'll go alone.

30:46.760 --> 30:48.230
You could get hurt.

30:48.250 --> 30:49.860
I won't leave you.

30:50.900 --> 30:52.660
We can do this.

31:26.330 --> 31:27.800
Becca,you here?

31:43.950 --> 31:45.120
Becca?

31:49.880 --> 31:51.080
Becca?

31:51.100 --> 31:52.500
Daniel?

32:21.290 --> 32:22.410
Becca?

32:28.700 --> 32:29.910
Becca!

32:33.990 --> 32:35.250
Becca?

32:35.930 --> 32:37.170
Daniel?

32:42.450 --> 32:43.620
Becca?

32:56.110 --> 32:59.370
mom, dad? are you here?

32:59.390 --> 33:01.800
She's here,another one.

33:11.580 --> 33:13.890
mom? dad?

33:24.270 --> 33:26.200
Are those your parents?

33:26.520 --> 33:28.690
You.Is it over?

33:28.720 --> 33:29.900
Can I go now?

33:29.930 --> 33:31.020
Who are you?

33:31.790 --> 33:33.380
He has a gun.

33:49.350 --> 33:51.440
Why did you all come here?

33:52.530 --> 33:55.080
How did you find this place?

34:00.690 --> 34:02.730
It still hurts.

34:02.760 --> 34:04.490
We were promised.

34:06.010 --> 34:07.800
You said...

34:07.880 --> 34:09.400
he promised.

34:13.620 --> 34:16.320
Becca,I'm scared.

34:16.360 --> 34:18.679
Who are all these people?

34:47.420 --> 34:49.650
Melinda,see?

34:49.690 --> 34:53.250
Just a few stitches
and you're all better.

34:55.320 --> 34:59.440
And we can stop somewhere
special on the way home.

35:03.680 --> 35:05.470
oh, melinda

35:07.840 --> 35:09.620
It's ok,honey.

35:09.660 --> 35:11.850
They're just upset.

35:12.100 --> 35:14.720
Erwe we supposed to help.

35:14.990 --> 35:17.150
I can't understand them.

35:17.380 --> 35:18.650
There's too many voices.

35:18.680 --> 35:19.880
I know.

35:19.910 --> 35:23.620
But if you try,you can
hear what's important,

35:23.660 --> 35:28.100
the one soul that we need
to hear most at that moment.

35:29.690 --> 35:33.630
All we have to do is
listen with our hearts.

35:38.010 --> 35:39.660
Where is he?

35:40.190 --> 35:42.290
I can't find him!

35:44.550 --> 35:47.520
Sweet girl,can you help me?

35:47.540 --> 35:50.050
I need to find my husband.

35:58.180 --> 36:02.460
Daniel? I'm here.

36:14.160 --> 36:15.130
i'm here.It's ok.

36:15.190 --> 36:16.520
No,it's not.

36:16.660 --> 36:17.830
We can't find my parents.

36:17.860 --> 36:19.180
I know.

36:19.380 --> 36:20.710
I did.

36:20.800 --> 36:21.890
I listened for them.

36:21.910 --> 36:23.570
Then,I heard them calling for you.

36:23.610 --> 36:26.310
- Daniel? honey
- Daniel? Where is he?

36:26.350 --> 36:27.500
Daniel!

36:27.890 --> 36:30.240
I've been waiting for you for so long.

36:33.540 --> 36:34.150
It's ok.

36:34.200 --> 36:35.660
You can go to them.

36:36.760 --> 36:38.120
Daniel,what's wrong?

36:38.160 --> 36:40.200
Daniel. Come.

36:41.160 --> 36:43.360
You said they'd never leave you.

36:44.120 --> 36:46.500
But you didn't believe that,did you?

36:47.720 --> 36:50.890
Not after what happened that
night before the accident.

36:51.180 --> 36:52.500
It's my fault.

36:52.550 --> 36:56.050
We never would have been in
that car if I didn't screw up.

36:57.370 --> 36:59.580
My friend levi's
parents were out of town.

36:59.620 --> 37:03.030
We all said we were sleeping
at someone else's house.

37:03.120 --> 37:06.080
And we snuck into their liquor cabinet.

37:07.080 --> 37:10.360
We went outside and started
taking out some mailboxes.

37:15.280 --> 37:17.320
Someone called the police.

37:17.390 --> 37:18.680
And then they called us.

37:18.730 --> 37:22.900
At 2 A.M.,We're picking our
13-year-old up from the police station.

37:22.950 --> 37:25.760
Blaming ourselves,each other.

37:25.790 --> 37:29.310
Arguing over who was supposed
to follow up with levi's parents,

37:29.350 --> 37:32.410
still thinking every
mistake could be avoided.

37:32.440 --> 37:36.060
If I hadn't done that,if you
weren't so tired and worried--

37:36.090 --> 37:39.150
daniel! That car swerved into our lane.

37:39.450 --> 37:40.420
Dad!

37:40.880 --> 37:42.770
It wasn't your fault.

37:43.020 --> 37:46.590
And even if it was,we
would never leave you.

37:46.990 --> 37:48.500
Then where were you?

37:48.530 --> 37:50.550
Your parents died at the hospital.

37:50.580 --> 37:52.680
We didn't understand what happened.

37:52.710 --> 37:55.460
How could we still be here and you not?

37:56.540 --> 37:58.240
And then,we met a man who...

37:58.270 --> 37:59.690
told us he could bring us to you.

37:59.720 --> 38:01.360
A man. Who are you talking about?

38:01.420 --> 38:05.600
He didn't say his name-- only that
we shouldn't go into the light.

38:05.640 --> 38:09.470
If we did,our son would be lost forever.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.450
We're together now.

38:15.190 --> 38:16.940
Do you see it?

38:18.240 --> 38:20.390
It's so beautiful.

38:21.660 --> 38:23.090
Daniel.

38:23.510 --> 38:25.010
Come.

38:26.140 --> 38:27.750
I can'T.

38:29.230 --> 38:30.650
I don't see it.

38:30.700 --> 38:31.610
He needs your help.

38:31.650 --> 38:33.090
But how? What's keeping him here?

38:33.140 --> 38:35.780
Just listen with your heart. Ok?

38:35.810 --> 38:37.850
You'll find the answer.

38:41.110 --> 38:42.960
He's staying behind because of me.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.700
I've already hurt my family so bad.

38:45.970 --> 38:47.510
I don't want to leave and hurt you.

38:47.530 --> 38:49.650
- Daniel,it's ok--
- it's not.

38:50.460 --> 38:52.070
We know that now.

38:52.100 --> 38:54.170
Look around this place.

38:56.810 --> 38:59.910
Who's going to watch
over you in the dark?

38:59.970 --> 39:02.070
Daniel,if you do this...

39:02.550 --> 39:04.800
you'll be helping
becca.You--

39:05.070 --> 39:07.640
you'll prove to her that
there's nothing to be afraid of.

39:07.680 --> 39:10.840
Come on,daniel. Just try.

39:11.360 --> 39:13.050
See the light.

39:13.960 --> 39:15.740
For me.

39:27.150 --> 39:28.660
Look at that.

39:29.570 --> 39:30.880
Mom.

39:31.530 --> 39:32.960
Dad.

39:33.850 --> 39:35.500
I see it.

39:40.010 --> 39:43.520
Take care of her,will you?

39:43.800 --> 39:46.890
Yes. Yes,I will.

40:03.820 --> 40:05.670
We want to believe you.

40:07.090 --> 40:09.010
You have no idea how much.

40:09.060 --> 40:11.300
But it almost seems impossible.

40:11.950 --> 40:14.520
If you need help explaining anything...

40:14.710 --> 40:15.900
dad...

40:18.360 --> 40:21.860
there's someone...a man.

40:21.890 --> 40:24.500
He's been wanting me to
tell you both something.

40:24.540 --> 40:26.600
He's been asking for a long time.

40:29.230 --> 40:33.560
I was scared of him at
first because he looked...

40:35.850 --> 40:38.510
he said he died of an aneurysm.

40:38.890 --> 40:41.130
He said you're married because of him.

40:41.160 --> 40:43.290
She's talking about larry.

40:43.330 --> 40:46.720
He introduced us,but becca,he
died before you were even born¡ª

40:46.750 --> 40:49.330
he wanted you guys to meet for so long.

40:49.410 --> 40:52.050
But you guys just kept on saying no.

40:52.350 --> 40:55.000
And he just kept saying¡ª

40:55.030 --> 40:57.080
Have a little faith.

41:28.540 --> 41:29.870
what if I don't know how they died,

41:29.900 --> 41:32.720
or what if I don't know what
it is they're really missing?

41:32.750 --> 41:35.490
- What if it just--
- hey,relax. Ok?

41:35.530 --> 41:37.580
I just saw you do it.

41:37.660 --> 41:39.840
I didn't tell you what
it was that daniel needed.

41:39.880 --> 41:43.000
You just listened with your heart.

41:43.030 --> 41:44.100
Yeah.

41:44.130 --> 41:45.740
Can I ask you something?

41:45.780 --> 41:50.600
When you were running away,why
did you stop here,in grandview?

41:50.640 --> 41:52.890
I don't know,just a feeling.

41:53.040 --> 41:56.070
The bus stopped,and
something told me to get off.

41:56.390 --> 41:58.600
- It was just--
- something you had to do.

41:58.630 --> 42:00.160
Yeah.

42:02.440 --> 42:04.440
well,you know where to find me.

42:27.230 --> 42:29.760
I wasn't sure if you were still in town.

42:30.050 --> 42:32.290
Something told me you were.

42:33.750 --> 42:35.730
Is it really worth it,gabriel?

42:35.760 --> 42:39.340
To break up families just
for a few extra souls?

42:39.370 --> 42:41.750
I mean,what could you
possibly need them for?

42:41.800 --> 42:44.410
It's not just about gaining
or losing a few extra souls.

42:44.480 --> 42:46.970
Of course not,unless you
happen to be one of them.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.630
As usual,you're missing the big picture.

42:48.670 --> 42:50.070
What is the big picture?

42:50.110 --> 42:51.830
'Cause you're just a collector.

42:51.850 --> 42:55.570
And please,don't stand there and pretend
like you're doing something noble.

42:58.070 --> 42:59.980
Wait a minute.

43:01.160 --> 43:03.370
You didn't want them,did you?

43:03.450 --> 43:04.710
You wanted her.

43:04.790 --> 43:08.290
That's what drew her here,the
same thing that drew you.

43:11.500 --> 43:14.160
Please,don't do this.

43:14.790 --> 43:17.090
You have a real choice.

43:17.130 --> 43:19.790
You could work with me,and we can
free all of those souls down there--

43:19.820 --> 43:22.760
sorry. I picked another horse.

43:22.800 --> 43:24.130
He's much faster than you.

43:24.160 --> 43:26.380
Then what are you doing here?

43:26.470 --> 43:28.130
You're my sister.

43:28.770 --> 43:30.070
And you have a choice too.

43:30.090 --> 43:30.940
What does that mean?

43:30.970 --> 43:33.970
It means don't be so sure
you have all the answers.
