WEBVTT

00:00.134 --> 00:01.123
Diane?

00:01.234 --> 00:03.828
No. Deirdre.
I'm her sister.

00:05.539 --> 00:07.439
What sort of an estate
are you running here?

00:07.508 --> 00:09.942
That's Magnum.
You'll get used to him.

00:10.011 --> 00:11.444
Well, didn't Deirdre
give you my message?

00:11.512 --> 00:12.501
Deirdre's here?

00:12.613 --> 00:15.514
I'm talking about
the mental institution
she was committed to

00:15.583 --> 00:16.709
for trying to murder me.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.251
Did you ever try
and kill her?

00:18.319 --> 00:20.787
No! Never. I swear!

00:20.855 --> 00:23.153
You can't have
known Diane very long,

00:23.324 --> 00:25.952
and already
you're doubting her story.

00:26.060 --> 00:28.324
I'll have to kill him, too.
No!

00:28.396 --> 00:29.886
No!

01:33.795 --> 01:37.026
<i>Last week on part one</i>
<i>of</i> Echoes of the Mind.

01:56.918 --> 01:58.715
You're not
frightening me, Deirdre.

01:58.787 --> 02:00.914
I'm not trying to,
sister darling.

02:01.022 --> 02:03.320
Oh, yes, you are.
You always are.

02:03.725 --> 02:04.953
Deirdre!

02:13.101 --> 02:14.261
Michelle?

02:14.369 --> 02:15.563
Uh, no.

02:18.239 --> 02:21.367
I'm sorry. You're obviously
expecting someone else.

02:21.476 --> 02:23.808
No, you're the one
I was waiting for.

02:24.446 --> 02:26.038
Why'd you come to me?

02:26.114 --> 02:28.480
I just felt you were
meant to help me.

02:39.794 --> 02:41.125
Hi, dogs.

02:55.210 --> 02:58.236
Kidnapped at five,
a father who makes you
take shooting lessons

02:58.313 --> 03:00.804
and keep a daily diary
of suspicious persons.

03:00.882 --> 03:04.648
Well, I'd say it'd be amazing
if you and your sister
weren't paranoid.

03:04.953 --> 03:06.944
Deirdre's not paranoid.

03:07.322 --> 03:09.085
Tell me more about her.

03:09.257 --> 03:12.351
We may be identical twins,
but we're not alike.

03:13.128 --> 03:16.461
We've never dressed alike,
thought alike

03:16.965 --> 03:18.159
or felt alike.

03:20.034 --> 03:23.492
Why, Magnum.
You're falling in love.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.698
I am not in love with her.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.442
But I'm afraid I could be.

03:30.512 --> 03:32.742
When I got
my first look at Elizabeth,

03:32.814 --> 03:37.251
I swear to you, Magnum,
that I knew that someday
she'd be my wife.

03:37.719 --> 03:40.847
Agatha, I have decided
to marry.

03:41.256 --> 03:42.587
I will!

03:42.857 --> 03:44.119
What?

03:45.727 --> 03:47.285
Well, Jonathan?

03:47.595 --> 03:50.155
Aren't you going
to say aloha

03:50.231 --> 03:52.631
or some other
quaint island expression?

03:53.168 --> 03:54.567
Of course.

03:55.737 --> 03:57.762
Oh.
Aloha.

04:01.476 --> 04:05.276
Excuse me, but we haven't been
properly introduced.

04:05.747 --> 04:08.079
Oh, I'm so sorry, Jonathan.

04:08.283 --> 04:11.741
I thought you knew
David Billingsworth.
An old friend.

04:11.820 --> 04:13.117
How do you do?
How do you do?

04:13.188 --> 04:14.746
And my solicitor.

04:15.457 --> 04:16.923
Solicitor?

04:17.024 --> 04:19.152
Here to draw up
the deed poll, old boy.

04:19.226 --> 04:20.716
Whose deed poll?

04:21.563 --> 04:22.757
Yours.

04:22.831 --> 04:26.858
She wants me
to give up my title and become
Lord Higgins-Ashley.

04:27.302 --> 04:28.462
You, a lord?

04:30.572 --> 04:32.437
I'm already a Lord, Magnum.

04:32.507 --> 04:35.032
The Baron of Perth.

04:35.610 --> 04:37.407
She wants me
to deed-poll my title

04:37.479 --> 04:40.505
because the Duke's title
is more prestigious
in the peerage.

04:40.582 --> 04:41.742
But I won't do it.

04:41.816 --> 04:43.408
Your phone is ringing.

04:44.018 --> 04:47.784
Thomas, I think
I've killed someone.

04:55.730 --> 04:58.631
Diane, somebody broke in here
and attacked you.

04:58.700 --> 05:02.136
Please, Thomas,
I don't want the publicity.

05:02.737 --> 05:05.171
I'm not gonna let you
stay here alone.

05:05.874 --> 05:07.808
Then stay with me.

05:10.745 --> 05:13.407
You think it possible
that she imagined all this?

05:14.816 --> 05:16.340
I don't know.

06:52.113 --> 06:53.102
Who is it?

06:53.181 --> 06:54.205
Jonathan.

06:56.618 --> 06:58.984
Jonathan? What's wrong?

06:59.554 --> 07:00.953
May I come in?

07:01.155 --> 07:02.247
Of course.

07:02.824 --> 07:04.257
Thank you.

07:12.266 --> 07:15.724
Oh, I must be looking
an awful fright.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.771
You look
perfectly fine.

07:20.108 --> 07:22.736
Could we have
a spot of tea?

07:23.778 --> 07:25.211
Of course.

07:34.722 --> 07:38.089
We've known each other
how long now?

07:38.493 --> 07:40.358
Nine-and-a-half years.

07:41.462 --> 07:42.895
Really?

07:46.067 --> 07:48.501
They've been good years,
haven't they?

07:48.569 --> 07:49.934
Oh, yes.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.199
The polo matches.

07:53.274 --> 07:55.572
The butterfly
expeditions.

07:56.511 --> 07:57.978
The theater.

07:58.046 --> 08:01.015
They've been
the happiest years
of my life.

08:01.215 --> 08:04.446
And the future ones
will be even happier.

08:05.219 --> 08:07.153
More complete.

08:09.657 --> 08:12.148
That's what I've come
to talk about.

08:12.393 --> 08:13.792
Our wedding?

08:16.531 --> 08:17.896
Agatha,

08:19.367 --> 08:23.064
you know how important
our friendship is to me...

08:23.438 --> 08:25.838
We'll still
be friends, Jonathan.

08:27.241 --> 08:29.766
...and that I would
never knowingly

08:29.844 --> 08:32.972
do anything to hurt you.

08:33.047 --> 08:35.174
Nor I you,
my dear.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.710
Damn it.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.046
What?

08:46.360 --> 08:49.193
Did I ever tell you
about Lieutenant Smythe?

08:49.630 --> 08:52.724
The one who was eaten
by a tiger?

08:53.735 --> 08:56.761
No, that was
Lieutenant Freebairn Smith.

08:58.005 --> 09:01.964
Smythe was a young officer
with our regiment in Kenya,
in the '50s.

09:02.977 --> 09:07.311
Joined up after his sweetheart
eloped with an officer
from the Highland Fusiliers.

09:08.583 --> 09:11.609
I've always said the Fusiliers
were interlopers.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.386
How sad.

09:14.322 --> 09:15.789
Yes. Well...

09:17.558 --> 09:19.355
There was a young girl
on the post,

09:19.427 --> 09:22.521
Penelope Gridley,
the adjutant's daughter.

09:23.598 --> 09:26.863
She and Lieutenant Smythe
took to seeing each other.

09:27.401 --> 09:31.770
Nothing romantic, mind you.
Just good friends.

09:33.040 --> 09:36.806
They went
to the regimental soirees
together, rode on hunts,

09:37.712 --> 09:39.373
collected butterflies.

09:41.015 --> 09:42.482
Anyway,

09:42.717 --> 09:46.118
it was around the time
of the Queen's birthday,
as I recall,

09:46.187 --> 09:50.055
that Lieutenant Smythe
received a letter
from his old sweetheart

09:50.658 --> 09:52.523
informing him that her husband
had been killed

09:52.593 --> 09:55.084
in a climbing accident
in the Himalayas.

09:56.097 --> 09:58.065
Naturally, he wrote back.

09:59.734 --> 10:01.599
One letter led to another,

10:01.669 --> 10:04.797
and before he knew it,
he'd proposed,

10:05.940 --> 10:08.807
and she accepted
by return post.

10:11.112 --> 10:13.444
Of course,
he had to tell Penny,

10:14.415 --> 10:17.407
but when he faced her
he found he couldn't.

10:19.320 --> 10:22.312
She learned
of his impending marriage

10:22.623 --> 10:25.888
through some wives
gossiping at a bridge party,

10:31.732 --> 10:34.257
I wouldn't want that
to happen to you.

10:35.703 --> 10:37.102
Jonathan,

10:39.507 --> 10:41.907
when you said
you'd decided to marry,

10:42.443 --> 10:44.240
it wasn't me?

10:45.479 --> 10:48.346
No. Lady...

10:48.416 --> 10:49.906
Ashley.

10:50.918 --> 10:52.146
Of course.

10:53.187 --> 10:56.088
Oh, what a silly ninny
you must think I am.

10:56.157 --> 10:59.320
Not at all. I think
you're the most wonderful lady
I've ever known.

10:59.393 --> 11:02.885
But not the lady
that you're going to marry.

11:02.964 --> 11:04.727
Agatha, I...

11:05.666 --> 11:07.395
Pot's boiling.

11:07.835 --> 11:11.066
I've got some nice new
herbal tea from Malaya

11:11.138 --> 11:12.867
I think you'll enjoy.

11:14.442 --> 11:16.467
I'll just be a moment.

11:28.389 --> 11:30.357
What's wrong
with the Fire Goddess of Pele?

11:31.659 --> 11:33.854
Nothing, if you're
into kinky pyrotechnics.

11:33.928 --> 11:36.726
Hey, look, this is
Higgins' bachelor party,
not Magnum's.

11:36.797 --> 11:39.357
Hey, look, would you get
that five-eighths
socket wrench for me, please?

11:39.433 --> 11:41.492
Boy, that was some party.
Remember?

11:41.569 --> 11:43.264
Yeah.
Saigon in the summer.

11:43.337 --> 11:46.431
All the Vietnamese
and French food you can eat,

11:46.641 --> 11:48.370
and all the champagne
you can drink,

11:48.442 --> 11:50.706
and those
Thai dancing girls. Whoa!

11:50.912 --> 11:52.937
Yeah, I'll never
forget it.

11:53.014 --> 11:55.915
Especially when
that naked chick popped out
of that dragon's head,

11:55.983 --> 11:58.508
firing that AK-47
all over the place.

11:58.586 --> 12:01.783
How was I supposed to know
she was VC when I hired her?

12:02.390 --> 12:04.824
Look, Orville, Higgins is
from the old school,

12:04.892 --> 12:07.554
so he should have
an old-school type
bachelor party,

12:07.628 --> 12:12.565
not one with twins
with flaming tassels twirling
all over their...

12:12.934 --> 12:14.333
Oh...
Oh, cute.

12:14.402 --> 12:17.428
You almost bought yourself
a $300 cashmere sweater.

12:17.505 --> 12:18.836
I'm sorry.

12:20.207 --> 12:22.835
Would you mind answering
the phone for me, please?

12:36.057 --> 12:37.490
Island Hoppers.
- <i>Hi, Rick.</i>

12:37.558 --> 12:40.652
Hey, Thomas. We were
just talking about
your bachelor party in Saigon.

12:40.728 --> 12:42.662
<i>You remember?</i>
How could I forget?

12:42.730 --> 12:44.755
It's probably the only
bachelor party in history

12:44.832 --> 12:46.823
where the best man
ended up with a Purple Heart.

12:46.901 --> 12:49.131
<i>You guys will never</i>
<i>forgive me for that,</i>
<i>will you?</i>

12:49.203 --> 12:50.568
Let me talk to T.C.

12:50.638 --> 12:52.629
Okay. T.C.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.164
Thomas.

12:54.308 --> 12:55.536
I'm busy.

12:55.977 --> 12:57.376
He's busy.

12:57.712 --> 12:58.872
This is important.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.208
<i>It's important.</i>

13:00.281 --> 13:02.511
T. C:
<i>It's always important. No.</i>

13:03.351 --> 13:05.512
<i>It's always important.</i>
<i>No.</i>

13:05.586 --> 13:09.078
Well, tell him I'll pay him
the gas money I owe him.

13:10.091 --> 13:13.356
He says he'll pay you
the gas money he owes you. No.

13:13.427 --> 13:14.519
No.

13:14.595 --> 13:16.460
You said no before he did.

13:16.530 --> 13:18.225
<i>Thomas, what is it</i>
<i>that you need?</i>

13:18.299 --> 13:21.097
Well, I want him to get
the passenger list

13:21.168 --> 13:24.797
from U.A. Flight 119
that arrived yesterday.

13:24.905 --> 13:27.635
How's T.C. Supposed to get
a passenger...

13:28.943 --> 13:30.137
Gloria.

13:30.244 --> 13:31.404
<i>Well, I thought</i>
<i>he could ask her,</i>

13:31.479 --> 13:33.743
but if he won't even
come to the phone...

13:33.814 --> 13:35.145
Um...

13:36.550 --> 13:38.848
What if I can get him
to ask her for you?

13:38.919 --> 13:40.580
Well, then I'd
owe you, buddy.

13:40.654 --> 13:41.643
Yeah?

13:41.822 --> 13:44.188
Two tickets
to the Lionel Richie concert?

13:44.258 --> 13:46.419
Rick, I've only got
two tickets.

13:46.494 --> 13:48.485
They're the best seats
in the house.

13:49.764 --> 13:52.028
Rick, the concert's sold out.

13:52.767 --> 13:54.257
This is blackmail.

13:54.468 --> 13:55.730
I know.

13:55.936 --> 13:57.369
Well, do we have a deal?

13:57.538 --> 13:58.527
Yes.

13:59.306 --> 14:00.739
Thank you.

14:04.145 --> 14:06.875
What ever happened
to favors for friends?

14:22.229 --> 14:23.389
Diane?

14:25.666 --> 14:26.894
Diane?

14:29.770 --> 14:31.032
Diane?

14:33.140 --> 14:34.334
Hey.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.566
I woke up

14:36.644 --> 14:39.613
and you disappeared
on me. Diane?

14:41.582 --> 14:43.015
No. Deirdre.

14:45.586 --> 14:47.144
Oh.

14:48.155 --> 14:49.679
Where's Diane?

14:50.357 --> 14:52.518
Out shopping,
according to this.

14:52.626 --> 14:55.220
I assume you're the Tom
she wrote it to.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.128
Oh, I'm Thomas Magnum.

14:58.399 --> 15:00.060
When did you get here?

15:00.367 --> 15:01.891
A while ago.

15:02.403 --> 15:06.396
I must say,
Diane's taste is improving.

15:07.074 --> 15:11.170
You're much
healthier-Iooking
than the others.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.379
Where'd she find you?

15:15.216 --> 15:17.650
She hired me.
I'm a private investigator.

15:17.718 --> 15:19.345
To do what?

15:21.922 --> 15:23.446
To protect her.

15:24.558 --> 15:26.389
Let me guess.

15:26.460 --> 15:29.759
Someone is following her,
but she doesn't know who.

15:29.864 --> 15:32.799
Or she hears footsteps,
but nobody's there.

15:33.667 --> 15:37.398
Or she's assaulted by a man,
but no one can find him.

15:39.273 --> 15:40.740
Which is it?

15:41.075 --> 15:43.737
Well, apparently
somebody broke in here...

15:43.811 --> 15:45.335
Apparently?

15:45.412 --> 15:47.812
You can't have
known Diane very long,

15:47.882 --> 15:50.612
and already
you're doubting her story.

15:51.852 --> 15:55.288
Evidently, you have brains
in addition to a body.

15:56.490 --> 15:57.718
Scotch?

15:57.791 --> 15:59.383
No, thank you.

15:59.460 --> 16:02.156
You're gonna need it.
Has she told you
about the hospital?

16:02.229 --> 16:03.457
I know about the accident.

16:03.531 --> 16:05.795
I'm not talking
about that hospital.

16:05.866 --> 16:09.165
I'm talking about
the mental institution
she was committed to

16:09.236 --> 16:10.760
for trying to murder me.

16:13.674 --> 16:15.198
I told you
you'd need that drink.

16:17.211 --> 16:19.042
Let's start at the beginning.

16:20.447 --> 16:23.814
Diane and I were kidnapped
when we were five.

16:24.618 --> 16:27.917
<i>I hated it.</i>
<i>Everything Deirdre told me</i>

16:28.322 --> 16:32.418
<i>about the mental institutions</i>
<i>Diane had been in and out of</i>
<i>since she was six,</i>

16:32.660 --> 16:37.120
<i>of the four suicide attempts,</i>
<i>how she twice tried</i>
<i>to kill her own twin sister.</i>

16:37.698 --> 16:40.599
<i>According to Deirdre,</i>
<i>Diane was a paranoid hysteric</i>

16:40.668 --> 16:44.536
<i>who could be shy</i>
<i>and innocent one moment,</i>
<i>aggressive and sexy the next.</i>

16:44.638 --> 16:47.129
<i>The more she told me,</i>
<i>the more I hated it,</i>

16:47.208 --> 16:48.937
<i>because it all made sense.</i>

16:49.009 --> 16:52.342
I couldn't leave
the stockholders' meeting
until it was over.

16:52.413 --> 16:55.280
And I didn't want to risk
someone else
bringing Diane home.

16:55.349 --> 16:58.580
So no one knows
Diane is in Hawaii
but you?

16:58.886 --> 17:00.080
That's right.

17:00.154 --> 17:01.644
How did you know?

17:03.257 --> 17:05.781
I didn't. Not for certain.

17:06.060 --> 17:09.257
But Diane always liked
to escape here
when she was troubled.

17:09.329 --> 17:10.729
So, I took a chance.

17:10.798 --> 17:11.992
Just like that?

17:12.066 --> 17:15.398
A busy businesswoman
flies 5000 miles on a chance?

17:15.803 --> 17:17.430
She is my sister.

17:17.771 --> 17:19.068
Yeah.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.266
What flight
you come in on?

17:23.077 --> 17:25.102
I don't remember. Why?

17:26.981 --> 17:29.176
Doesn't Diane sit
on the board of directors?

17:29.883 --> 17:33.011
Technically,
but I run Dupres Fabrics.

17:33.087 --> 17:34.782
And Diane's life?

17:34.922 --> 17:38.221
You know,
I don't like these questions
or your insinuations.

17:38.325 --> 17:40.725
Why must you control
Diane's life?

17:41.528 --> 17:43.860
I don't think
you've been listening.

17:44.031 --> 17:46.591
Diane has been mentally ill
since we were kidnapped.

17:46.667 --> 17:48.601
She couldn't take
what they did to us.

17:48.669 --> 17:50.330
It wasn't very pleasant.

17:51.639 --> 17:54.437
But we can't all go
to pieces, now, can we?

17:54.675 --> 17:56.870
Someone has to
mind the store, so to speak,

17:56.944 --> 17:58.468
to be responsible.

17:59.146 --> 18:01.137
In our family, that's me.

18:02.383 --> 18:06.285
I've taken care of Diane
since our father died
when we were 10,

18:06.553 --> 18:09.522
and I intend to continue
taking care of her,

18:12.626 --> 18:16.027
which brings me to the point
of our little discussion.

18:16.797 --> 18:19.732
Knowing Diane,
she didn't even ask your rate.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.800
However, I'll be willing
to pay whatever's fair.

18:24.438 --> 18:26.497
Diane hired me.
She'll have to fire me.

18:27.808 --> 18:29.742
I understand.
You want a bonus.

18:29.810 --> 18:33.075
How much? A thousand? Five?

18:34.915 --> 18:38.282
You seem awfully anxious
to get rid of me, Deirdre.

18:38.452 --> 18:40.181
What are you afraid of?

18:40.421 --> 18:41.786
Nothing.

18:43.157 --> 18:46.593
But you won't believe that
until you're satisfied
I'm telling the truth.

18:46.660 --> 18:48.525
So, check it out for yourself.

18:48.829 --> 18:52.595
I'll be happy to give you
the names of the doctors
and the hospital.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.501
Or better yet, ask Diane.

19:00.441 --> 19:02.306
Oh, by the way,

19:02.443 --> 19:05.207
a rather well-built Hawaiian
dropped a Ferrari off for you

19:05.446 --> 19:06.879
while you were asleep.

19:07.648 --> 19:10.116
You must be very good
at what you do.

19:23.763 --> 19:27.290
I don't know, man.
She is some tough lady.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.834
It's not my problem.

19:28.902 --> 19:32.838
You either get that passenger
list from her or you give me
300 bucks for a new sweater.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.603
Who won?

19:37.611 --> 19:38.908
Who do you think?

19:40.614 --> 19:42.809
That's one thing
I like about you, T.C.

19:42.883 --> 19:47.115
Indomitable in defeat,
insufferable in victory.

19:49.189 --> 19:51.953
Hey, you know, I was thinking
about that passenger list...
No.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.253
Why not?

19:53.326 --> 19:55.453
Because I could lose
my job.

19:55.562 --> 19:58.156
Oh, come on,
they're not gonna fire you.
You're just a stew.

19:58.231 --> 20:00.893
I am not a stew.
I'm a flight attendant.

20:00.967 --> 20:03.492
And if I were a stew,
I wouldn't be just a stew.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.470
Come on, come on,
you know what I mean.

20:05.538 --> 20:09.406
Sometimes, Theodore Calvin,
your mouth can put your life
in real jeopardy.

20:10.777 --> 20:13.302
You know, I like the way
your eyes get
when you get angry.

20:15.482 --> 20:16.779
Come on, honey.

20:16.850 --> 20:18.147
Don't "honey" me.

20:19.152 --> 20:22.349
Gloria, we're not talking
a breach of national security.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.583
I'm just asking
for a passenger list...
Shh!

20:24.658 --> 20:26.888
...of a bunch of passengers
that are already here.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.827
It is a federal offense
to give out a passenger list.

20:29.896 --> 20:33.195
Besides, rules are rules.
They're made for a reason.

20:33.366 --> 20:35.300
So, you're refusing me.

20:35.402 --> 20:38.667
Uh-huh, he understands.

20:39.706 --> 20:40.968
Mahi-mahi's ready.

20:41.041 --> 20:42.030
Oh, great!

20:43.610 --> 20:46.374
You know, in England
we'd have chips
with our fish.

20:46.446 --> 20:47.470
You're English.

20:47.547 --> 20:48.571
You what?

20:48.648 --> 20:52.175
You mean, we've been together
for six months and you've
only just worked that out?

20:52.252 --> 20:55.119
I'll bet you've been
to a bunch of English
bachelor parties, right?

20:55.188 --> 20:57.122
What kind of girl
do you think I am?

20:57.190 --> 21:00.591
No, I mean,
you know how to throw a real
English bachelor party.

21:00.660 --> 21:04.790
Yeah. Tell Orville
how proper gentlemen
throw a party for each other.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.889
Oh, you mean like
at Boodles or White?

21:06.967 --> 21:08.127
What's that?

21:08.201 --> 21:10.032
Very old
private clubs.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.636
You would like them.
No women allowed.

21:12.706 --> 21:15.106
Well, what are
these parties like?

21:15.575 --> 21:18.135
Well, they're
very elegant affairs.

21:19.312 --> 21:21.906
They're proper rowdy bashes
is what they are.

21:21.982 --> 21:25.474
They act like a bunch
of schoolboys on holiday
without a teacher,

21:26.853 --> 21:28.582
I was at one once.

21:29.155 --> 21:30.554
How did you get in?

21:30.991 --> 21:33.653
Through a cake. Popped up.
You know.

21:34.861 --> 21:38.524
Oh, it was all proper.
I was dressed. Well, sort of.

21:38.999 --> 21:40.591
Sarah!

21:40.900 --> 21:43.892
How could you do something
so chauvinistic?

21:43.970 --> 21:46.404
I was in love.
Did it for a boyfriend.

21:47.007 --> 21:51.444
I got a terrible cold
from all the champagne
they kept squirting at me,

21:51.578 --> 21:53.910
squirting at me
with water pistols.

21:54.147 --> 21:56.615
I don't think I wanna hear
any more of this.

21:56.683 --> 21:57.775
I do.

21:58.718 --> 21:59.878
You would.

21:59.953 --> 22:01.921
Tell me more
about the squirt guns.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.081
Say,

22:04.190 --> 22:06.920
if she was willing
to pop out of a birthday cake
for her boyfriend...

22:06.993 --> 22:08.290
No!

22:11.231 --> 22:13.096
Not even
if I promise to...

22:19.439 --> 22:20.804
Theodore.

22:26.179 --> 22:29.580
<i>Somehow Rick came up</i>
<i>with the manifest,</i>
<i>so I gave him the tickets.</i>

22:29.649 --> 22:33.210
<i>But also I got him to promise</i>
<i>to check on the Dupres family</i>
<i>for me,</i>

22:33.353 --> 22:34.945
<i>especially on Deirdre.</i>

22:35.121 --> 22:39.854
<i>Two tickets to a Lionel Richie</i>
<i>concert should be worth more</i>
<i>than just a flight manifest.</i>

22:40.860 --> 22:44.796
<i>Of the 342 names,</i>
<i>I recognized</i>
<i>half-a-dozen or so.</i>

22:44.931 --> 22:49.300
<i>A famous actress,</i>
<i>a cookie maker,</i>
<i>two US senators and a TVstar.</i>

22:50.637 --> 22:55.074
<i>Sixty-six of the passengers</i>
<i>were members of something</i>
<i>called "The Buffalo Chips",</i>

22:55.141 --> 22:57.939
<i>and the rest I assumed</i>
<i>were just tourists.</i>

22:58.111 --> 23:00.306
<i>A typical flight</i>
<i>from the mainland to paradise,</i>

23:00.380 --> 23:04.817
<i>only someone on that flight</i>
<i>broke into Diane's home</i>
<i>and tried to harm her.</i>

23:05.552 --> 23:08.282
<i>At least that's what</i>
<i>I wanted to believe.</i>

23:08.354 --> 23:09.753
Thomas.

23:11.257 --> 23:12.383
Hi.

23:17.030 --> 23:18.964
Why did you leave
without telling me?

23:19.899 --> 23:22.163
Well, didn't Deirdre
give you my message?

23:22.235 --> 23:23.600
Deirdre's here?

23:23.670 --> 23:25.763
Yeah, in your house.
Didn't you see her?

23:26.573 --> 23:27.938
Did she talk to you?

23:29.409 --> 23:30.433
Yes.

23:30.510 --> 23:31.499
You don't believe her,
do you?

23:32.345 --> 23:34.006
She lies about me.

23:34.714 --> 23:36.978
Please, tell me
you don't believe her.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.916
I don't know.

23:43.656 --> 23:44.987
Diane.

23:48.862 --> 23:50.090
Diane.

23:52.665 --> 23:55.259
Diane, wait a minute.

23:55.768 --> 23:56.792
Just let me go.

23:56.870 --> 23:58.895
I can't.
Not until we talk.

23:59.139 --> 24:02.040
Either you believe Deirdre
or you believe me.

24:02.108 --> 24:03.234
You don't even know
what she said.

24:03.309 --> 24:04.298
Oh, yes, I do!

24:05.411 --> 24:07.208
She said I'm crazy.

24:07.447 --> 24:11.042
That's what she tells
every man who shows
an interest in me.

24:11.518 --> 24:14.009
All right, then answer me
one question.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.414
What?

24:15.488 --> 24:16.978
Did you ever
attempt suicide?

24:24.430 --> 24:28.127
Yes, but she drove me to it.

24:30.003 --> 24:31.470
Did you ever try
and kill her?

24:31.538 --> 24:34.632
No! Never. I swear!

24:34.741 --> 24:36.003
Never.

24:40.013 --> 24:41.605
I believe you, Diane.

24:43.716 --> 24:46.082
All I wanted was
to hear it from you.

24:57.564 --> 24:58.929
Jonathan.

24:59.599 --> 25:02.295
What sort of an estate
are you running here?

25:04.003 --> 25:06.563
Oh. That's Magnum.

25:08.074 --> 25:09.939
You'll get used to him.

25:10.143 --> 25:11.701
Is he employed here?

25:12.445 --> 25:14.572
In a manner of speaking,

25:14.881 --> 25:18.146
he's a bit like
<i>The Man Who Came to Dinner.</i>

25:19.452 --> 25:23.582
Americans have such
a vulgar way of displaying
their affections in public.

25:26.159 --> 25:27.888
Yes. Don't they?

25:27.961 --> 25:31.328
The deed poll will,
of course, have to be brought
before the courts.

25:31.397 --> 25:33.922
But I don't foresee
any problems.

25:34.334 --> 25:36.825
It isn't as if we're
abdicating the throne, is it?

25:38.972 --> 25:42.772
Elizabeth, do you realize
what you're asking me
to relinquish?

25:43.476 --> 25:46.673
Well, of course, darling.
Your title.

25:47.380 --> 25:49.905
But with your brothers
and their children

25:49.983 --> 25:52.884
it's hardly likely you'll ever
become duke, is it?

25:53.319 --> 25:55.014
Well, that's not the point.

25:55.321 --> 25:56.345
It's not?

25:56.422 --> 25:57.855
Thank you, Mata.

25:58.658 --> 25:59.955
No.

26:00.159 --> 26:03.651
My family has been
in the peerage
for almost 800 years.

26:04.130 --> 26:07.122
You're asking me to give up
my heritage.

26:07.233 --> 26:10.225
Yes, but Jonathan,
it's not a title you ever use.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.535
That's not the point either.

26:12.605 --> 26:16.302
Forgive me, Jonathan.
What is the point?

26:16.609 --> 26:20.204
I want you to take
my family name when we marry.

26:20.913 --> 26:24.371
With respect, I don't think
you quite understand, old boy.

26:24.517 --> 26:27.213
Lady Ashley
married into her title.

26:27.520 --> 26:30.216
She may not retain her title
should she remarry.

26:30.290 --> 26:34.624
I know that,
but she will still be a lady.
The Baroness of Perth.

26:35.628 --> 26:40.031
But she's presently a Duchess.
The Duchess of Ashley.

26:41.434 --> 26:45.700
They're not really the same,
now, are they, Jonathan?

26:47.407 --> 26:48.806
Perhaps not,

26:49.442 --> 26:51.842
but Higgins is a name
I'm proud of,

26:51.911 --> 26:54.379
proud enough
to offer it to you.

26:55.882 --> 26:57.907
Well, thank you, darling.

26:59.285 --> 27:03.187
Yes, well, I'm sure
that we can settle this,
given a little time.

27:03.523 --> 27:06.981
But let's not let it
spoil our tea, shall we?

27:15.935 --> 27:17.232
Oh.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.434
Herb tea.

27:20.173 --> 27:22.141
How positively provincial.

27:22.241 --> 27:23.674
Where did you get it?

27:24.043 --> 27:25.237
Malaya.

27:26.579 --> 27:28.809
If you'll excuse me,
I have some errands to run.

27:28.881 --> 27:30.849
I'll be back in time
for dinner.

27:32.685 --> 27:34.550
Well, do try
not to be late, darling.

27:34.620 --> 27:38.556
I've asked the cook
to prepare a special curry
that Winnie used to adore.

27:38.858 --> 27:41.292
I'm sure
you'll love it, too.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.552
Yes, I'm sure.

27:48.968 --> 27:52.131
I think he is going to
be difficult, Lizzie.

27:52.238 --> 27:55.674
Oh, my dear David,
if I could handle a duke

27:55.742 --> 27:58.176
I can certainly handle
a baron.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.544
Deirdre would play
tricks on me.

28:05.618 --> 28:07.483
She'd hide my possessions,

28:07.553 --> 28:10.147
tell me that I'd done things
I hadn't done.

28:11.157 --> 28:15.924
She would even pose as me
and then do terrible things
and I'd get blamed for it.

28:16.662 --> 28:20.359
It got so
I didn't know what was reality
and what was Deirdre's doing.

28:22.668 --> 28:24.966
Finally father sent me
to the hospital.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.026
How old were you?

28:26.406 --> 28:27.430
Eight.

28:28.274 --> 28:30.208
Didn't the doctors
believe you?

28:30.276 --> 28:34.679
No. They said
I couldn't face what happened
during the kidnapping.

28:35.081 --> 28:38.448
But it was Deirdre.
It was always Deirdre.

28:39.318 --> 28:42.014
And she still does
things like this to you?

28:42.155 --> 28:43.417
Sometimes.

28:44.557 --> 28:48.891
She said the accident
was an attempt to kill her
and to commit suicide,

28:50.930 --> 28:52.295
but it wasn't.

28:52.365 --> 28:55.061
I just wanted her
to leave Ted and me alone.

28:55.535 --> 28:58.060
She was beginning
to mix me up again.

28:59.138 --> 29:01.106
So when I left the hospital

29:01.174 --> 29:03.768
I came here
to get away from her,

29:03.843 --> 29:06.937
to put some of my perspective
back in my life.

29:07.947 --> 29:10.347
Then things began to happen.

29:10.983 --> 29:12.416
Footsteps,

29:13.653 --> 29:17.180
the feeling I was being
watched, the dogs.

29:19.025 --> 29:20.890
The man who broke in.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.188
Do you understand, Thomas?

29:29.535 --> 29:30.832
Diane,

29:31.604 --> 29:33.003
last night,

29:35.007 --> 29:37.840
when Higgins left,
you fell asleep on the couch.

29:37.910 --> 29:39.605
I was exhausted.

29:40.713 --> 29:43.841
Yeah, and I covered you
and I took a shower.

29:46.152 --> 29:47.710
Did you join me?

29:48.321 --> 29:49.618
What?

29:52.725 --> 29:56.525
Did you join me in the shower
and sleep with me?

30:44.043 --> 30:45.442
Jonathan.

30:47.046 --> 30:48.536
May I come in?

30:49.515 --> 30:51.949
Haven't we
been through this once?

30:53.319 --> 30:54.980
Yes, I believe we have.

30:56.155 --> 30:58.419
Please, I need your advice.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.470
This is bloody awkward.

31:12.605 --> 31:14.334
Jonathan, whatever it is

31:14.407 --> 31:17.570
it can't be any more awkward
than last night.

31:18.144 --> 31:20.772
No. I suppose not.

31:22.982 --> 31:24.449
Where to begin?

31:24.517 --> 31:26.542
Why not at the beginning?

31:29.622 --> 31:34.559
I was sent down
from Sandhurst my third year.

31:35.561 --> 31:36.892
I know.

31:37.129 --> 31:38.391
You know?

31:38.698 --> 31:41.963
My cousin Charles Briggs
was at Sandhurst with you.

31:42.034 --> 31:43.729
Parker Briggs,
your cousin?

31:43.869 --> 31:44.858
Yes.

31:45.304 --> 31:47.101
Well, why didn't you ever
tell me?

31:47.173 --> 31:50.631
Because you've never told me
you were sent down
from Sandhurst.

31:50.910 --> 31:53.071
I didn't want
to embarrass you.

31:58.184 --> 31:59.583
Agatha,

32:01.053 --> 32:03.647
I've disappointed the family
twice in my life.

32:04.223 --> 32:05.656
I can't do it again.

32:05.725 --> 32:08.216
What on earth
are you talking about?

32:08.561 --> 32:11.291
Elizabeth wants me
to deed-poll my title.

32:11.664 --> 32:13.894
Why, for heaven's sake?

32:15.568 --> 32:17.058
Oh.

32:18.137 --> 32:22.665
She doesn't want to give up
being the Duchess of Ashley.

32:23.009 --> 32:24.567
Afraid not.

32:25.811 --> 32:28.644
I realize now

32:30.416 --> 32:32.350
that I'm not in love
with Elizabeth,

32:33.719 --> 32:36.745
at least, not the Elizabeth
who's here today.

32:38.257 --> 32:41.090
I'm in love
with that young girl
on the runaway horse

32:41.160 --> 32:43.492
who's life I saved
in Hyde Park.

32:45.197 --> 32:46.562
I see.

32:50.803 --> 32:53.135
Are you going
to call off the wedding?

32:53.205 --> 32:54.570
How can I?

32:54.674 --> 32:56.335
One doesn't propose
to a duchess

32:56.409 --> 32:59.435
and then take it back like
some Mayfair street peddler.

32:59.612 --> 33:01.170
It's bad form.

33:02.782 --> 33:04.443
What am I to do?

33:04.517 --> 33:07.884
She's here.
My family's flying in
for the wedding.

33:09.455 --> 33:11.548
Including Father Paddy?

33:30.509 --> 33:32.477
He's being positively rude.

33:32.912 --> 33:35.142
Bad manners breed
like mosquitoes

33:35.214 --> 33:37.079
in the backwaters
of the empire.

33:38.718 --> 33:41.585
Lizzie, for the life of me,

33:42.321 --> 33:45.290
I fail to see why
you're marrying this bloke.

33:45.891 --> 33:47.483
Oh, David.

33:48.661 --> 33:52.290
Do you realize what it's like
to be a widow in the peerage?

33:52.398 --> 33:55.959
All you ever do
is go to Brown's
for tea and crumpets,

33:56.168 --> 33:58.329
or sit on some ridiculous
committee or another

33:58.404 --> 34:00.201
to save the Victorian Rose.

34:01.207 --> 34:03.107
Well, it's not for me.

34:03.642 --> 34:05.507
And Jonathan is...

34:05.578 --> 34:07.910
He's sweet in his own way,

34:08.614 --> 34:10.706
and very well connected.

34:11.150 --> 34:14.551
There are many more functions
I can go to escorted.

34:18.123 --> 34:20.524
Well, I could escort you.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.024
Lovely.

34:23.429 --> 34:25.090
And what
would Millie say?

34:25.164 --> 34:26.152
Who?

34:26.766 --> 34:29.462
Oh. Yes.

34:30.436 --> 34:31.835
Millie, yes.

34:33.038 --> 34:35.165
<i>Oh, Danny boy</i>

34:35.507 --> 34:39.739
<i>The pipes, the pipes</i>
<i>are calling</i>

34:40.411 --> 34:42.004
Good evening to you.

34:42.148 --> 34:44.172
Is me brother Jonny about?

34:44.650 --> 34:45.639
Your brother?

34:45.717 --> 34:47.913
Aye. Jonathan Higgins.

34:47.987 --> 34:50.751
I'm his brother,
Father Patrick McGuiness.

34:50.822 --> 34:54.281
I've flown in
from Northern Ireland
to perform the wedding.

34:54.527 --> 34:55.619
To what?

34:55.694 --> 34:57.127
To perform the wedding.

34:57.196 --> 34:58.857
Are you deaf or...

34:59.298 --> 35:00.663
Oh.

35:02.251 --> 35:04.378
You must be Lady Ashley.

35:05.421 --> 35:07.446
The blushing bride.

35:10.726 --> 35:13.320
Welcome to the family,
darling.

35:14.630 --> 35:16.097
Excuse me.

35:16.332 --> 35:18.698
I've been on airplanes
for 17 hours

35:18.767 --> 35:22.032
and all they do is give you
these wee bottles of whiskey.

35:22.338 --> 35:25.000
You wouldn't have any Irish,
would you?

35:25.874 --> 35:27.603
I should say not.

35:28.277 --> 35:30.177
Ah, a gin man, are you?

35:30.412 --> 35:32.573
Well, to each his own.

35:39.755 --> 35:41.086
Oh.

35:48.180 --> 35:49.579
Did I miss something?

35:49.648 --> 35:52.879
Oh, <i>tres amusant,</i> Jonathan.

35:52.951 --> 35:55.181
Oh, the disguise is excellent.

35:55.254 --> 35:58.746
I would never have caught on
until you lit the butt end
of that cigarette.

35:58.824 --> 36:01.156
Now, that was really too much.

36:01.627 --> 36:04.824
Yes, quite good.
Quite good indeed.

36:05.164 --> 36:07.758
I don't know
what the two of you
are talking about.

36:07.833 --> 36:11.769
Oh, now, come on, Jonathan.
The jig is up.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.600
I'm not Jonathan.

36:13.672 --> 36:16.197
But I know all the Higginses.

36:16.542 --> 36:18.339
I know the Duke, the Earl...

36:18.410 --> 36:21.277
Ah, you're talking about
me father and brothers.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.278
Half-brothers,
to be exact,

36:23.415 --> 36:25.383
although I've never
liked the term myself.

36:25.450 --> 36:27.941
A brother's a brother,
a sister's a sister.

36:28.387 --> 36:31.720
With respect,
there are no girls
in the Higgins family.

36:33.258 --> 36:36.591
Well, don't tell that
to Soo-Ling
Elizabeth Whitefeather

36:36.662 --> 36:38.220
or Kutama-numba.

36:39.331 --> 36:41.026
I think I'm going to be ill.

36:41.099 --> 36:44.865
Ah, it's prenuptial jitters.
It'll pass after the wedding.

36:46.471 --> 36:50.601
How did the General manage
to keep the news

36:50.776 --> 36:53.677
of you and the others
out of the peerage?

36:53.979 --> 36:57.005
Well, I don't think Father
bandied it about the club.

36:57.249 --> 36:59.217
But what difference
does it make?

36:59.284 --> 37:01.218
We're here
to celebrate a wedding,

37:01.286 --> 37:03.652
not Father's lack of them.

37:05.023 --> 37:06.547
<i>Erin go bragh.</i>

37:10.829 --> 37:12.023
Oh, my God.

37:12.097 --> 37:14.531
That would be
a loose translation.

37:16.702 --> 37:19.068
You can tell Jonathan
the wedding is off,

37:19.137 --> 37:21.537
and he shall be hearing
from my solicitors.

37:21.607 --> 37:24.872
Keeping this
illegitimate family from me

37:24.943 --> 37:26.274
is a breach of promise.

37:26.345 --> 37:27.642
Now, Lizzie,
technically, it isn't.

37:27.713 --> 37:29.146
You see...
David.

37:29.214 --> 37:30.943
He'll hear from me.

37:39.524 --> 37:42.493
Oh, Jonathan,
you were wonderful.

37:42.661 --> 37:46.153
I only got close enough
to hear the last few minutes,

37:46.231 --> 37:48.131
but you had me convinced.

37:50.269 --> 37:52.737
And who might you be, lass?

37:52.804 --> 37:54.863
Oh, stop it, Jonathan.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.909
You were absolutely
wonderful.

37:57.976 --> 37:59.500
Your performance was...

37:59.578 --> 38:02.172
Ah, faith 'n' begorrah!

38:02.247 --> 38:04.681
Where's me brother,
Jonathan?

38:07.919 --> 38:10.285
Is that you, Jonny?

38:12.724 --> 38:14.351
Oh, my God.

38:24.436 --> 38:27.234
<i>All the way back to her place,</i>
<i>Diane didn't speak.</i>

38:27.305 --> 38:28.738
<i>I didn't blame her.</i>

38:28.807 --> 38:32.470
<i>What Deirdre had done to us</i>
<i>was not something</i>
<i>you could really talk about.</i>

38:33.478 --> 38:36.003
<i>When we got there,</i>
<i>Deirdre was out.</i>

38:36.114 --> 38:37.411
<i>In a way, I was relieved.</i>

38:37.482 --> 38:40.974
<i>If she'd been there</i>
<i>I might not have been able</i>
<i>to control my anger.</i>

38:41.052 --> 38:44.647
<i>I convinced Diane</i>
<i>the best thing to do was to</i>
<i>go away with me for a while,</i>

38:44.723 --> 38:47.886
<i>let time sort things out.</i>
<i>She agreed.</i>

38:48.827 --> 38:51.728
<i>But first, she wanted</i>
<i>to have it out with Deirdre.</i>
<i>Alone.</i>

38:51.796 --> 38:55.197
<i>So I came back to pack a bag</i>
<i>and wait for her to call.</i>

38:56.067 --> 39:00.299
<i>Everything had happened</i>
<i>so fast, I never got a chance</i>
<i>to read Diane's diary.</i>

39:01.539 --> 39:03.029
<i>I wish I had.</i>

39:04.142 --> 39:06.201
<i>It read like a text</i>
<i>on paranoia.</i>

39:06.344 --> 39:08.209
<i>Each day</i>
<i>was a collection of fears,</i>

39:08.279 --> 39:12.682
<i>diligently documented</i>
<i>descriptions of every stranger</i>
<i>she came into contact with.</i>

39:13.752 --> 39:15.720
<i>It was a wonder Diane</i>
<i>didn't lock herself in</i>

39:15.787 --> 39:18.415
<i>and never venture further</i>
<i>than the front door.</i>

39:28.733 --> 39:30.530
<i>Then the diary</i>
<i>suddenly changed.</i>

39:34.172 --> 39:37.869
"Met Kioni at Waikiki.
Terrific body.

39:40.679 --> 39:44.115
"Delicious young
Polynesian boy.
Took him home..."

39:58.463 --> 40:01.364
<i>The entry had been written</i>
<i>by a different person,</i>

40:02.967 --> 40:05.993
<i>but how could that</i>
<i>have happened without</i>
<i>Diane knowing?</i>

40:07.839 --> 40:11.002
<i>We may be identical twins,</i>
<i>but we're not alike.</i>

40:12.210 --> 40:14.405
<i>She's left-handed, I'm right.</i>

40:14.913 --> 40:16.881
<i>She's left-handed, I'm right.</i>

40:17.348 --> 40:19.111
<i>She's left-handed, I'm right.</i>

40:22.687 --> 40:24.120
Oh, God.

40:31.529 --> 40:34.464
<i>Rick called</i>
<i>with his report on the Dupres.</i>

40:34.532 --> 40:36.329
<i>I knew what</i>
<i>he was going to say.</i>

40:36.401 --> 40:38.562
<i>It was the only</i>
<i>possible explanation.</i>

40:38.636 --> 40:40.263
<i>Alfred Dupres</i>

40:40.338 --> 40:43.967
<i>paid a million-dollar ransom</i>
<i>to the abductor</i>
<i>of his daughters,</i>

40:44.042 --> 40:46.135
<i>and the man was never caught.</i>

40:46.277 --> 40:49.678
<i>Perhaps that's why the family</i>
<i>was able to suppress</i>
<i>what really happened.</i>

40:49.748 --> 40:53.240
<i>Both girls had been physically</i>
<i>and sexually abused,</i>

40:53.318 --> 40:55.752
<i>and only one</i>
<i>had survived. Diane.</i>

40:55.854 --> 40:57.253
<i>Since 1961,</i>

40:57.322 --> 41:01.190
<i>Deirdre had only lived</i>
<i>in the fantasies</i>
<i>of Diane's mind.</i>

41:02.927 --> 41:05.225
<i>Going someplace,</i>
<i>sister darling?</i>

41:05.296 --> 41:07.196
How dare you.
<i>Pardon me?</i>

41:07.265 --> 41:11.258
Thomas told me.
Everything you said,
everything you did!

41:11.603 --> 41:15.369
<i>I must say, Diane,</i>
<i>your taste in men</i>
<i>is improving.</i>

41:15.540 --> 41:19.636
<i>Magnum seems to be bright</i>
<i>in addition to being rather</i>
<i>physically attractive.</i>

41:19.911 --> 41:21.242
I should kill you.

41:21.312 --> 41:23.576
<i>Oh, you've tried,</i>
<i>sister darling.</i>

41:24.549 --> 41:27.575
No, I never did,
I never did.

41:28.019 --> 41:29.509
The car was an accident.

41:29.587 --> 41:31.384
<i>I'm not talking</i>
<i>about the accident.</i>

41:31.456 --> 41:33.515
<i>I'm talking about</i>
<i>at the institution.</i>

41:33.591 --> 41:37.618
<i>All those little sessions</i>
<i>with dear Dr. Bernard,</i>
<i>plotting to get rid of me.</i>

41:37.896 --> 41:40.694
<i>Did you think I wouldn't hear?</i>
<i>Wouldn't find out?</i>

41:40.965 --> 41:44.799
I never listened, I swear.
I never listened.
I never listened to Ted.

41:44.869 --> 41:46.427
<i>Oh, you listened.</i>

41:47.238 --> 41:49.536
I would never do anything
to harm you.

41:49.774 --> 41:51.435
<i>Then why'd you hire Magnum?</i>

41:51.509 --> 41:53.477
<i>Why did you give him</i>
<i>the diary?</i>

41:55.146 --> 41:57.114
I was just so afraid

41:57.549 --> 42:00.313
and I thought the kidnapper
was following me.

42:00.385 --> 42:02.910
And you know he said he...
<i>Liar!</i>

42:03.054 --> 42:05.181
<i>You hired Magnum</i>
<i>to find out about me,</i>

42:05.256 --> 42:07.383
<i>to take you back</i>
<i>to the funny farm.</i>

42:08.092 --> 42:11.425
Please, Deirdre, stop it.

42:13.665 --> 42:14.689
I'm so frightened. I...

42:14.766 --> 42:15.755
<i>You best be,</i>

42:16.000 --> 42:18.400
<i>because if I die</i>
<i>you'll be all alone.</i>

42:18.469 --> 42:21.370
<i>You do remember</i>
<i>what that's like, don't you?</i>

42:23.208 --> 42:24.470
Don't go.

42:25.410 --> 42:26.741
Deirdre?

42:28.780 --> 42:30.042
Deirdre?

42:32.050 --> 42:33.312
Deirdre?

42:33.585 --> 42:35.678
Deirdre? Deirdre?

42:36.254 --> 42:37.551
Deirdre?

42:40.792 --> 42:42.521
Where are you?

42:44.028 --> 42:46.553
Deirdre, please don't hide.

42:47.999 --> 42:49.296
Please?

42:49.601 --> 42:52.035
<i>I thought you wanted</i>
<i>to get rid of me.</i>

42:52.103 --> 42:53.468
No.

42:55.740 --> 42:58.709
Just don't disappear
like that. You know...

43:15.426 --> 43:18.224
Why? Why?

43:18.563 --> 43:21.361
<i>Don't be a fool.</i>
<i>He came to take us back.</i>

43:22.433 --> 43:25.129
But you didn't
have to kill him.

43:32.310 --> 43:33.402
Diane?

43:37.949 --> 43:39.382
Diane?

44:04.909 --> 44:06.103
Diane?

44:08.313 --> 44:09.644
Diane!

44:15.320 --> 44:16.651
Diane?

44:19.624 --> 44:21.455
Sorry, darling.

44:22.026 --> 44:24.995
You really are wonderful,

44:25.797 --> 44:28.391
but survival is survival.

44:30.668 --> 44:32.568
Don't let her
kill me, Diane.

44:38.076 --> 44:40.510
Run, Thomas, run!

44:41.312 --> 44:42.711
I can't, Diane.

44:45.750 --> 44:47.081
Diane?

44:49.620 --> 44:51.144
Deirdre's dead.

44:57.795 --> 44:59.990
How's that for dead?

45:00.131 --> 45:01.530
She's dead.

45:02.600 --> 45:04.727
You don't need her to survive.

45:04.802 --> 45:06.326
Liar!

45:06.537 --> 45:08.027
Isn't that what
the doctors told you?

45:08.106 --> 45:10.631
You don't need Deirdre
to survive.

45:10.975 --> 45:13.443
She can't live without me.

45:14.779 --> 45:19.045
I'm the strong one.
I've always been
the strong one.

45:19.584 --> 45:24.021
No. Diane's the strong one.
She's the one who lived.

45:24.989 --> 45:26.388
No!

45:30.728 --> 45:32.787
Deirdre's dead, Diane.

45:34.565 --> 45:36.556
You can live without her.

45:37.068 --> 45:38.660
No, I can't.

45:40.171 --> 45:42.036
I can't control her.

45:44.409 --> 45:46.070
She'll come back.

45:46.944 --> 45:48.775
Maybe not for years,
but she'll come back,

45:48.846 --> 45:50.609
and when she does,
she'll kill you.

45:50.681 --> 45:51.875
No.

45:52.984 --> 45:55.452
You can get her
out of your life forever.

45:56.254 --> 45:57.619
You can...

45:59.924 --> 46:01.789
We can do it together.

46:06.230 --> 46:07.663
I love you.

46:15.006 --> 46:16.371
I love you.

46:20.856 --> 46:22.585
No!
