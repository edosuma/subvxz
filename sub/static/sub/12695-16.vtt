- *

00:12.213 --> 00:14.014
- This heatwave is the worst.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.516
- So hot.

00:15.616 --> 00:18.252
It's like we moved
into dad's bellybutton.

00:24.092 --> 00:25.826
- No, no, I got this.

00:25.926 --> 00:29.997
It's not like you guys
can move things with your minds.

00:30.098 --> 00:32.133
- Let me help, Nora.

00:32.233 --> 00:34.902
The hose goes over there.

00:35.002 --> 00:36.904
- All right, Billy, go turn
on the water so we can

00:37.004 --> 00:39.207
turn this room
into our own private waterpark.

00:39.307 --> 00:41.875
- On it.

00:41.975 --> 00:42.843
- Hold on.

00:42.943 --> 00:44.011
Nobody move.

00:44.112 --> 00:46.180
Assessing, assessing.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.349
Mm-hmm. Something's different.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.551
- Kids, why is
the slide inside?

00:50.651 --> 00:52.453
- The slide!

00:52.553 --> 00:55.189
We make a great team.

00:55.289 --> 00:56.257
- You know we wouldn't
need this slide

00:56.357 --> 00:57.291
if we just had a pool.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.026
- I want a pool.

00:59.127 --> 01:00.394
Come on, dad!

01:00.494 --> 01:03.231
- Okay, you can have a pool.

01:03.331 --> 01:04.932
- Seriously? Awesome.

01:05.032 --> 01:06.134
- Hank.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.301
- I'm the good cop, Barb.

01:07.401 --> 01:10.138
Now you swoop in
and shut this down.

01:10.238 --> 01:11.172
- Oh, okay, tell you what.

01:11.272 --> 01:13.907
If you kids can help
raise the money,

01:14.007 --> 01:16.310
we'll chip in too
and see what we can afford.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.145
- Oh.

01:17.211 --> 01:17.978
- Awesome.
- Great.

01:18.146 --> 01:22.015
- Your bad cop needs work.

01:22.150 --> 01:23.151
- I can't wait for a pool.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.051
Step aside.

01:24.152 --> 01:26.887
I'm doing this.

01:26.987 --> 01:28.156
- Max.

01:28.256 --> 01:29.690
I-I-I don't think
you should be--

01:29.790 --> 01:31.392
- Whoo-hoo!

01:31.492 --> 01:32.893

- Guys, this is gonna be great.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.890
We'll make a fortunate selling
our old junk, buy a pool

02:36.990 --> 02:39.760
and then invite cute boys
over for pool parties.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.762
- What is it with you
and cute boys?

02:41.862 --> 02:42.963
- What?

02:43.063 --> 02:44.232
It's not like I have an app
on my phone that tells me

02:44.265 --> 02:45.466
when there's one on our block.

02:45.566 --> 02:46.534
- [phone dings]

02:46.634 --> 02:48.236
- VOICE ON PHONE: He's cute.

02:51.972 --> 02:54.007
- I've had enough
of this place.

02:54.107 --> 02:59.247
Unbearable heat,
unnecessary singing, Billy.

02:59.280 --> 03:03.351
Jetpack, take me away!

03:03.451 --> 03:05.686

03:05.786 --> 03:07.355
- Uh, I blame Billy.

03:10.258 --> 03:11.559
- Oh cool.

03:11.659 --> 03:15.296
Comic books and action figures.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.964
Oh, this isn't cool.

03:17.064 --> 03:19.567
It's just mom.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.735
No one's gonna buy
this Electress stuff.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.471
Mom never saved the world
like Dad did.

03:23.571 --> 03:27.074
- Yeah, but she did other
stuff like...

03:27.174 --> 03:29.410
What did she do?

03:29.510 --> 03:30.678
- I don't know.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.680
But Dad was out there stopping
runaway trains,

03:32.780 --> 03:34.982
taking down villains
and inventing the cookie pie.

03:35.082 --> 03:36.517
Is it a cookie? Is it a pie?

03:36.617 --> 03:38.486
Only Dad knows.

03:38.586 --> 03:41.522
- It's both.

03:41.622 --> 03:45.192
- And that's why he's
a national treasure.

03:45.293 --> 03:47.761
- I am so proud of you kids,
chipping in,

03:47.861 --> 03:50.798
working together as a family,
learning songs.

03:50.898 --> 03:55.603
* Yard sale,

03:55.703 --> 03:56.704
What you got there, Billy?

03:56.804 --> 03:58.472
- I'm selling all my army men.

03:58.572 --> 03:59.873
Well, almost all.

03:59.973 --> 04:02.910
Not Sergeant Flargeant,
he's my favorite.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.745
- Sergeant Flargeant?

04:04.845 --> 04:05.913
Who's this?

04:06.013 --> 04:07.381
Corporal Smorporal?

04:07.481 --> 04:10.217
- It is now.

04:10.318 --> 04:12.386
- Nora, you must
really want a pool.

04:12.486 --> 04:13.554
You're selling all your bows?

04:13.654 --> 04:15.055
- Yep.

04:15.155 --> 04:17.391
Yesterday, it was so hot, my bow
melted and stuck to my head.

04:17.491 --> 04:18.926
It's a part of me now.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.632
- Oh, Phoebe, that's all
my old Electress stuff.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.233
You can't sell that.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.936
- [chuckles] No kidding.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.838
- What does that mean?

04:30.938 --> 04:33.907
- What do you mean?

04:34.007 --> 04:35.343
- I mean you can't sell that

04:35.376 --> 04:38.412
because my actual Electress whip
is in this box.

04:38.512 --> 04:40.481
This is a very dangerous weapon.

04:40.581 --> 04:42.149
If someone besides me
uses this,

04:42.249 --> 04:43.551
they would really hurt
themselves.

04:43.651 --> 04:44.552
- [chuckles] What'll happen?

04:44.652 --> 04:46.053
Their lights will turn off?

04:48.522 --> 04:49.523
Got it, putting the box back.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.024
- Thank you.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.361
- Uh, honey, you kind of
left out the part

04:53.427 --> 04:55.363
where if your whip
gets in the wrong hands,

04:55.396 --> 04:58.198
it'll explode and take out
half a city block.

04:58.366 --> 05:01.001
- And risk that info getting
back to our supervillain son

05:01.101 --> 05:04.472
voted most likely to take
out half a city block?

05:04.572 --> 05:05.739
- So smart.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.876
Uh, you know, you really were
something back in the day.

05:08.976 --> 05:12.212
- Back in the day?

05:12.380 --> 05:14.014
- I don't know
why I say things.

05:17.718 --> 05:18.652
- [phone dings]

05:18.752 --> 05:20.220
- VOICE ON PHONE: He's cute.

05:22.790 --> 05:25.125
- Ooh, and he's right outside.

05:30.097 --> 05:32.199
Oh, he is cute.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.271
- What is it gonna take

05:38.406 --> 05:43.411
to put you in these
old, dirty pants today?

05:43.511 --> 05:44.578
- Here's your bow.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.879
You got a good one.

05:45.979 --> 05:47.681
I wore it to my first circus.

05:47.781 --> 05:52.986
It still smells like elephant
and childish wonder.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.422
Give it back, you monster!

05:54.455 --> 05:56.424
I don't need
your dirty bow money!

05:59.827 --> 06:03.897
- So...how are things
going over here?

06:03.997 --> 06:06.233
- A lot of looky-loos,
but nobody's serious.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.335
I think I'll call it a day.

06:08.436 --> 06:11.439
- Nora, I know these bows mean
a lot to you, but if you want

06:11.539 --> 06:14.141
that pool, you're gonna have
to make some sacrifices.

06:14.241 --> 06:15.976
- Can we sell Dr. Colosso?

06:16.076 --> 06:20.013
He's never liked you, and
now Billy's on his list.

06:20.113 --> 06:22.015
- Why don't you go upstairs,
pick out the ones

06:22.115 --> 06:24.985
you don't wear anymore
and just sell those?

06:25.085 --> 06:26.454
- Okay.

06:28.656 --> 06:32.593
What are you looking at?

06:32.693 --> 06:36.530
- I see you eyeing those
old, dried up paintbrushes.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.031
You a collector?

06:38.131 --> 06:39.166
- Save it.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.167
I'm here for comics.

06:40.267 --> 06:43.136
You got any, tank top?

06:43.236 --> 06:44.905
- I'm not wearing a tank top.

06:45.005 --> 06:48.842
- But you look like
you got a bunch.

06:48.942 --> 06:50.778
- What I got a bunch of
is comics,

06:50.878 --> 06:53.547
but I'm not gonna sell 'em
to some kid who calls me names.

06:53.647 --> 06:54.347
- I got 50 bucks.

06:54.482 --> 06:56.216
- Tank top will be right back.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.491
Well, you know what they say.

07:03.524 --> 07:08.929
One man's trash is another weird
kid's 50 bucks worth of trash.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.498
- [sighs]

07:10.598 --> 07:11.999
I need an app that finds
cute boys

07:12.099 --> 07:14.234
that don't ask me
to pull their finger.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.507
Oh, uh, mom, you didn't
have to move the box.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.941
I was totally gonna do it.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.776
- I didn't move it.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.546
Oh, no, what if somebody
took it outside to sell it?

07:25.646 --> 07:27.915
- That box isn't going
anywhere 'til trash day.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.817
- What?
- Coming!

07:32.052 --> 07:33.220
- If you like
that box of garbage,

07:33.320 --> 07:37.224
you'll love these dirty pants.

07:37.324 --> 07:39.359
- Hey, Max, have you seen
that box of mom's old stuff?

07:39.527 --> 07:41.028
- Seen it and sold it.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.563
- What?

07:42.663 --> 07:44.397
[whispers] Max, that box had
mom's old Electress whip in it.

07:44.532 --> 07:47.535
- Oh, poor sucker, now
he's gotta throw it out.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.069
- No, Max, it's her real whip.

07:49.169 --> 07:51.672
It's super dangerous
in a non-sups' hands.

07:51.772 --> 07:52.706
You've gotta get it back.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.575
Whoever bought it could
get seriously hurt.

07:54.675 --> 07:59.446
- Luckily, I don't get
too attached to my customers.

07:59.547 --> 08:02.850
- Hurt kid plus angry
mom equals no pool.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.018
- No pool equals sad Max.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.319
Hey, kid, get back here!

08:06.419 --> 08:07.254
Wait, am I hurting the kid?

08:07.354 --> 08:10.457
- Just get the box back.

08:10.558 --> 08:12.960
- So did Max see the box?

08:13.060 --> 08:13.994
- Sure did.

08:14.094 --> 08:14.962
- Oh, good.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.564
Did he put it back in the attic?

08:16.597 --> 08:19.332
- [chuckles] Would I be standing
here avoiding eye contact

08:19.432 --> 08:21.635
if Max didn't
put the box in the attic?

08:25.573 --> 08:29.176
- Oh, oh, oh,
time to beat the heat.

08:29.276 --> 08:33.346
Oh, oh, freezy socks!

08:35.683 --> 08:37.350
- [snaps]

08:44.191 --> 08:47.027
- Hey.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.963
Whatcha wearin'?

08:50.063 --> 08:51.965
- You told me to sell
all the bows I don't wear.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.835
But look, I still wear them all.

08:54.935 --> 08:58.005
- [crash]

08:58.105 --> 09:01.341
- How did my kids get so weird?

09:01.441 --> 09:04.144
[laughing]

09:04.244 --> 09:07.114
Frozen thundies!

09:07.214 --> 09:09.850
Uh, uh, uh.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.085
Ah!

09:15.088 --> 09:16.156
- There's the nerd mobile.

09:16.256 --> 09:19.192
This must be the place.

09:19.292 --> 09:22.462
- [doorbell music plays]

09:22.630 --> 09:26.333
- Yep, this is the place.

09:26.433 --> 09:28.969
- What do you want, hipster?

09:29.069 --> 09:32.740
- Look, I sold that box to you
by mistake,

09:32.840 --> 09:35.342
and I was wondering
if I could get it back.

09:35.442 --> 09:38.311
Here's your 20 bucks.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.715
- I gave you 50, sideburns.

09:41.815 --> 09:42.983
- Right.

09:51.925 --> 09:56.664
Wait, there's something
missing in here.

09:56.697 --> 09:59.166
- You mean
Electress' real whip?

09:59.266 --> 10:02.269
I don't know how you got it, but
you're never getting it back,

10:02.369 --> 10:04.371
Wall Street.

10:04.471 --> 10:06.106
- Stop calling me
names and give it back.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.975
- I'm not giving
this bad boy up.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.577
I'd only give this
to Electress herself.

10:10.678 --> 10:14.347
We all know that's not
gonna happen, Chinatown.

10:14.447 --> 10:18.485
- [locks snapping]

10:18.585 --> 10:21.388
- Like four locks
are gonna stop me.

10:21.488 --> 10:23.090
[laughs]

10:23.190 --> 10:24.825
- [alarm beeping]

10:24.925 --> 10:26.559
- That might.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.365
- *

10:32.465 --> 10:33.466
- No whip?

10:33.566 --> 10:34.567
Why'd you come home
without the whip?

10:34.668 --> 10:36.036
How did he even know
the whip was real?

10:36.136 --> 10:36.737
- I don't know.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.171
He's some sort of super fan.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.140
Okay, he said he'd never give
it back to anyone

10:40.240 --> 10:41.541
but Electress herself.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.610
- Oh, well then we'll
just ask mom to help us.

10:43.711 --> 10:46.613
- You think that's a good idea?
- No.

10:46.714 --> 10:47.681
Oh, but we could tell dad.

10:47.781 --> 10:50.718
- Really?
- No!

10:50.818 --> 10:53.553
- BARB: Max, is
that you down there?

10:53.653 --> 10:57.124
- [in high-pitched voice]
Yes, I'm down here.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.325
- Why did you use a fake voice
if you're just

10:58.425 --> 11:00.227
gonna say you're down here?

11:00.327 --> 11:01.895
- BARB: Is that
you too, Phoebe?

11:01.995 --> 11:05.933
- [in deep voice] Yes, it's me.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.801
Look, if we wanna get that pool,
we gotta get that whip back

11:07.901 --> 11:10.170
before mom figures out
it's gone.

11:10.270 --> 11:10.637
Here she comes.

11:10.738 --> 11:11.939
Lose the box.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.577
- [crash]

11:17.745 --> 11:19.312
- DR. COLOSSO: Ow!
I know that was you, Billy!

11:22.916 --> 11:25.552
- Hey, mom, what's the haps?

11:25.652 --> 11:27.788
- Max, where did
you put my stuff?

11:27.888 --> 11:30.991
- Uh, in the attic right next
to the thing, under the thing

11:31.091 --> 11:33.460
with the thingy.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.362
- I-I just need
to find my whip.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.564
It could blow up...

11:37.664 --> 11:42.069
your minds it's so cool and not
dangerous.

11:42.169 --> 11:45.338
Luckily my old Electro-puter
here has a homing signal

11:45.438 --> 11:47.941
that can locate it in a jiffy.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.676
- [whispers] Quick, go to your
old people translator app

11:49.777 --> 11:53.280
and figure out
what "jiffy" means.

11:53.380 --> 11:57.650
- Oh, no, it means fast,
Phoebe, really fast.

11:57.785 --> 11:58.786
- [computer beeping]

11:58.819 --> 12:00.821
- Two hundred and
fifty-three updates.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.322
- [blows air]

12:02.422 --> 12:03.791
- Has it been that long?

12:03.824 --> 12:04.825
- [computer beeping]

12:04.925 --> 12:07.227
- Oh, this thing's
gonna take forever.

12:07.327 --> 12:08.862
- Max, we need a plan.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.097
- Way ahead of you.

12:10.197 --> 12:13.200
If he wants Electress,
we'll give him Electress.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.868
Electress.

12:14.968 --> 12:18.205
- Why are you
calling me Elect--oh.

12:18.305 --> 12:22.142
- *

12:22.242 --> 12:24.812
- So, dad, do you think we've
made enough to get a pool?

12:24.912 --> 12:26.113
- No quite, Billy.

12:26.213 --> 12:31.018
Pools cost a little more
than $8.17 and a button.

12:36.156 --> 12:42.029
- Well, Sergeant Flargeant,
looks like this is goodbye.

12:42.129 --> 12:45.933
It'll be easier if
we don't look at each other.

12:46.033 --> 12:47.835
- Billy, what are you doing?

12:47.935 --> 12:49.636
You can't sell
Sergeant Flargeant.

12:49.736 --> 12:50.871
- I have to.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.340
I really want to get
that pool for you.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.209
You've been crying ever since
you got out here.

12:56.309 --> 12:57.510
- I'm not crying.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.846
This is sweat.

12:58.879 --> 13:01.414
- Yeah, sweat
from your eyeballs.

13:01.514 --> 13:02.515
- I'm serious.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.918
It's like a million degrees
under these things.

13:05.018 --> 13:09.056
- A million degrees of sadness.

13:09.156 --> 13:11.358
- Nora, honey,
why are you crying?

13:11.458 --> 13:13.160
- It's sweat!

13:13.260 --> 13:16.463
- *

13:16.563 --> 13:18.031
- [knocking on door]

13:18.131 --> 13:21.869
- BOY: Use the doorbell!

13:21.902 --> 13:27.140
- [doorbell music plays]

13:27.240 --> 13:31.578
- Well, look who's
wearing a tank top.

13:31.678 --> 13:33.646
- It's hot, okay?

13:33.746 --> 13:37.217
Anyway, I thought you'd
might like to meet someone.

13:37.317 --> 13:40.087
Oh, Electress!

13:40.187 --> 13:42.722
- [electricity zapping]

13:42.890 --> 13:44.624
- Hello, citizen.

13:44.724 --> 13:45.758
- Electress!

13:45.893 --> 13:46.994
Is it really you?

13:47.094 --> 13:48.595
- Yes, it is me.

13:48.695 --> 13:50.931
I hope you turn off the light
when you leave a room.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.765
- I do! I don't.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.902
I will!

13:55.002 --> 13:56.904
- I believe you have
something of mine.

13:56.937 --> 13:59.006
- Yes, yes, your whip.

13:59.106 --> 14:01.308
Come in, my high-wattage queen.

14:12.519 --> 14:17.724
- Whoa, I see you're a fan
of Electress...who is me.

14:17.824 --> 14:19.659
- Of course, you're my hero.

14:19.759 --> 14:21.028
I'll be right back.

14:21.128 --> 14:23.496
I hid your whip in case
your mortal enemy Blackout

14:23.596 --> 14:24.597
came looking for it.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.033
- Bright idea, boy.

14:26.133 --> 14:28.701
We wouldn't want it
falling into his hands.

14:28.801 --> 14:29.636
- You--you mean her hands.

14:29.736 --> 14:31.939
- I mean, her hands.

14:32.039 --> 14:34.641
Ha, spark attack.

14:34.741 --> 14:37.177
- [electricity zapping]

14:39.812 --> 14:41.614
- Wow, Max, I can't believe
these gloves you made

14:41.714 --> 14:42.515
actually work.

14:42.615 --> 14:43.650
- Me neither.

14:43.750 --> 14:47.687
I made them completely of
parts from your laptop.

14:47.787 --> 14:49.389
I just hope he comes back soon.

14:49.489 --> 14:52.759
Seeing mom's face everywhere
is freaking me out.

14:52.859 --> 14:53.760
- It's not just her face.

14:53.860 --> 14:57.130
This place is a shrine.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.732
- This lonely loser pasted
mom's face on the cover

14:59.832 --> 15:02.035
of this superhero magazine.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.637
- No, Max, I think that's real.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.040
I think this is all real.

15:07.140 --> 15:11.244
"Electress short
circuits robot army."

15:11.344 --> 15:15.315
"Electress saves White House
then lights Christmas tree."

15:15.415 --> 15:16.383
- How could mom
have done all of this?

15:16.483 --> 15:19.252
She can't even work
the thermostat.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.088
- I got your whip.

15:21.188 --> 15:24.191
But before you go,
Electress...

15:24.291 --> 15:26.826
what was your favorite battle
ever?

15:26.994 --> 15:30.697
- [laughs] That would be like
choosing my favorite child,

15:30.797 --> 15:32.265
impossible.

15:32.365 --> 15:35.902
Although at first, I'd have
to say my oldest daughter.

15:36.003 --> 15:38.338
- Well, this was fun.

15:38.438 --> 15:43.276
But Electress has to get
to a charity event.

15:43.376 --> 15:46.413
Needy children
without batteries.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.215
- So I'll just take my whip.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.450
- Sorry, one more question.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.652
What ever happened
to your sidekick?

15:52.752 --> 15:54.654
- I had a sidekick?

15:54.754 --> 15:56.489
Oh, ha, ha, my sidekick.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.091
I was just telling
this guy that story.

15:58.191 --> 16:00.027
Here, tell him the story.

16:00.127 --> 16:01.161
- Don't look at me.

16:01.261 --> 16:02.362
Until we got
to this dweeb cave,

16:02.462 --> 16:04.664
I thought she was
dad's sidekick.

16:04.764 --> 16:06.533
- Oh.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.268
A return of the spark attack.

16:08.368 --> 16:09.302
- [electricity buzzing]
- Ow!

16:09.402 --> 16:10.903
- Oh, sorry.
- [electricity buzzing]

16:11.038 --> 16:12.239
- Turn it off!
- I can't!

16:14.541 --> 16:16.443
- You're not
the real Electress!

16:16.543 --> 16:17.277
Liars!

16:17.377 --> 16:22.115
Whiggy, whiggy whip!

16:22.215 --> 16:23.716
- Hey, what are you doing?

16:23.816 --> 16:24.284
- I'm sorry.

16:24.384 --> 16:27.087
Whiggy, whiggy whip?

16:27.187 --> 16:28.888
Is that something
Electress used to say?

16:29.056 --> 16:30.057
- Nope.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.325
That was all Cedrick.

16:35.562 --> 16:36.363
- [computer beeping]

16:36.463 --> 16:38.165
- Now we're cooking with gas.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.333
Seventy percent done.

16:40.433 --> 16:41.168
- [computer beeping]

16:41.268 --> 16:42.069
- Sixty-eight?

16:42.169 --> 16:44.071
How are you going backwards?

16:44.137 --> 16:45.105
Fifty-one?

16:45.205 --> 16:46.673
You're worse than
the thermostat.

16:46.773 --> 16:51.111
Ugh!

16:51.211 --> 16:53.613
- No one's buying
anything anymore, dad.

16:53.713 --> 16:56.549
They're just playing with stuff.

16:56.649 --> 16:57.550
Dad?

16:57.650 --> 17:00.087
- Ah!

17:00.153 --> 17:01.621
You're right, Billy.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.723
At this rate, you guys probably
won't make enough for a pool.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.625
- That's because
everybody bailed.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.094
Where are Max and Phoebe?

17:07.160 --> 17:09.129
[in deep voice] "We should
do a yard sale, guys."

17:09.229 --> 17:12.799
[in high-pitched voice] "We can
tods make a lot of money, guys."

17:12.899 --> 17:15.102
- Whoa, Billy,
take it easy, buddy.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.969
- I sold Sergeant Flargeant.

17:17.104 --> 17:19.672
My favorite toy now belongs to
that pasty kid down the street

17:19.772 --> 17:23.143
who smells like cauliflower.

17:23.243 --> 17:24.311
- Well, it's still light out.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.713
You wanna stay and see
if we can sell anything?

17:26.813 --> 17:27.547
- Nah.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.116
Let's just pack it up.

17:29.149 --> 17:30.883
- *

17:30.983 --> 17:32.285
- Step right up.

17:32.385 --> 17:36.189
Nora's prized bows
are now for sale.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.191
This one was worn by the queen.

17:38.291 --> 17:40.193
This one can charge
your cellphone.

17:40.293 --> 17:43.730
This one has a pocket.

17:43.830 --> 17:46.366
- Nora, why are selling
all of your bows?

17:46.466 --> 17:48.135
- I realized I was being silly.

17:48.235 --> 17:51.504
It's not fair if everyone else
is giving up stuff and I'm not.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.806
Just like you gave up
Sergeant Flargeant.

17:58.745 --> 18:02.048
- I am really
proud...of you both.

18:02.149 --> 18:03.650
- Thanks.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.686
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have some bows to sell.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.555
This bow belonged to Rihanna.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.357
This one can cure loneliness.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.024
This one has a blog.

18:14.461 --> 18:16.429
- [blows air]

18:16.529 --> 18:17.697
- My freeze breath
isn't working either.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.866
I think the whip is
cancelling our powers.

18:19.966 --> 18:22.702
- Uh, man, mom had
some pretty cool stuff.

18:22.802 --> 18:26.038
- Uh-oh, Max, it's getting hot.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.540
- It's becoming unstable.

18:27.640 --> 18:28.908
I just hope it doesn't spark.

18:29.008 --> 18:31.478
It's a sure sign
a weapon's about to explode.

18:31.578 --> 18:32.579
- [sparks]

18:32.679 --> 18:37.217
- And it's sparking.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.286
- Hello, jerks.

18:39.386 --> 18:40.820
I just called my dad.

18:40.920 --> 18:44.291
And when he gets home, you guys
are gonna be in big trouble.

18:44.391 --> 18:45.492
- Cedrick,
you have to let us go.

18:45.592 --> 18:47.527
We think this whip
is about to explode.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.061
- Why should I believe you?

18:49.196 --> 18:52.465
You guys have been lying
to my face ever since I met you.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.201
- You know what? You're right.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.235
Let's start over.

18:55.335 --> 18:58.070
I'm...Monica.

18:58.205 --> 19:02.742
And this is Ross.

19:02.842 --> 19:06.413
- And for all you know, we
could be Electress' children.

19:06.513 --> 19:07.780
- Please.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.817
There's no way kids with a mom
as cool as Electress

19:10.917 --> 19:14.721
would know absolutely nothing
about her.

19:14.821 --> 19:15.788
- He's right.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.290
We're horrible kids.

19:17.390 --> 19:20.460
- It's true, you are.

19:20.560 --> 19:21.861
- Look, mom is
an amazing superhero,

19:21.961 --> 19:24.431
and some random kid knows
more about her than we do.

19:24.531 --> 19:28.268
- [electricity zapping]

19:28.368 --> 19:31.471
- Shocked...to see me.

19:31.571 --> 19:33.139
- Electress!

19:37.076 --> 19:38.245
- Amazing!

19:38.311 --> 19:42.048
How'd you find me,
my super-charged goddess?

19:42.148 --> 19:45.585
- No need to make
this weird, citizen.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.554
I used my state-of-the-art
homing device

19:47.654 --> 19:51.123
to track my whip here.

19:51.258 --> 19:55.295
Thank you, young man, for
being a heroic Electrolyte.

19:55.395 --> 19:58.265
- Electress, these posers
aren't really your kids,

19:58.331 --> 19:59.266
are they?

19:59.332 --> 20:00.032
- My kids?

20:00.132 --> 20:01.268
No way.

20:01.268 --> 20:03.870
My kids would never be so
reckless as to compromise

20:03.970 --> 20:07.340
their identities and safety just
to make a couple of bucks.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.444
- Told you.

20:11.544 --> 20:15.715
- But I will make sure
they get what's coming to them.

20:15.815 --> 20:20.620
- A stern talking to while
we swim in our new pool?

20:20.720 --> 20:22.889
- Farewell, young sparkplug.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.858
- [electricity zapping]

20:25.958 --> 20:27.494
- Electress, wait!

20:27.594 --> 20:32.532
Before you go, who's gonna pay
for this hole in my carpet?

20:32.632 --> 20:35.167
- *

20:35.268 --> 20:36.369
- Well, you did it.

20:36.469 --> 20:42.074
You got the pool you earned.

20:42.174 --> 20:45.512
- We did all that hard work
for this.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.380
- Oh, no, she didn't!

20:47.480 --> 20:49.115
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

20:49.215 --> 20:50.517
Hey.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.319
We are still proud of you kids.

20:52.419 --> 20:55.455
- Well, two of you.

20:55.555 --> 20:56.656
- Why are you proud of me?

20:56.756 --> 20:59.091
I only sold one stinking bow.

20:59.191 --> 21:03.763
- And it was a pleasure
doing business with you.

21:03.863 --> 21:06.132
Good luck cashing
that check, girly.

21:06.232 --> 21:07.767
Away!

21:07.867 --> 21:09.068
- [engine fizzles]

21:09.168 --> 21:10.337
- Uh.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.204
And Billy wins again.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.777
- Mom, did you really use
the Eiffel Tower

21:17.877 --> 21:19.746
to stop an alien invasion?

21:19.846 --> 21:21.981
- [in French accent]
But of course.

21:22.081 --> 21:23.716
- One time, I used
it as a harpoon--

21:23.816 --> 21:24.484
- Quiet, dad.

21:24.584 --> 21:26.653
- Yeah, mom's talking.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.187
Mom, we are so sorry
we didn't know

21:28.355 --> 21:29.589
all those amazing things
about you.

21:29.689 --> 21:31.558
You really used to be somebody.

21:31.658 --> 21:35.428
- Thank you, I think.

21:35.528 --> 21:36.363
- Yeah.

21:36.463 --> 21:37.664
I don't know why
you don't talk about it.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.198
Dad brags about his
stuff all the time.

21:39.366 --> 21:40.733
- Oh, you wanna hear
the harpoon story?

21:40.833 --> 21:42.502
- Quiet, dad.

21:42.602 --> 21:44.537
- You know, as great as
those days were, my biggest

21:44.637 --> 21:47.807
accomplishments are sitting
right here beside me.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.976
- Aw, thanks, mom.

21:50.076 --> 21:51.878
- And now that you're grounded,
you'll be beside me

21:51.978 --> 21:55.014
for the next six months.

21:55.114 --> 21:57.617
- Come on, mom, tell
us one superhero story.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.386
- [indistinct chatter]

21:59.452 --> 22:00.487
- It was so long ago.

22:00.587 --> 22:02.955
There I was, up against
the deadliest sea monster,

22:03.055 --> 22:04.090
Squidonkulis.

22:04.190 --> 22:05.492
- Oh, I fought
Squidonkulis once.

22:05.592 --> 22:06.793
- ALL: Dad!

22:06.893 --> 22:08.528
- *

22:11.498 --> 22:16.135
- *
