02:18.360 --> 02:21.250
No, they headlined a Renaissance festival

- The <i>alibi.</i>
- Which was what?

04:37.160 --> 04:39.447
What, is this a fucking quiz?

04:39.520 --> 04:42.569

- He did.
- What did he expect, right?

06:25.040 --> 06:27.566
- With that Leon Russell knockoff...
- Have a seat.

06:37.120 --> 06:39.726
Inside every man

06:39.800 --> 06:42.246

06:42.320 --> 06:44.607
What the Germans call a doppelgänger.

06:44.920 --> 06:48.527
Perhaps this doppelgänger has different hair

06:48.600 --> 06:50.807
or a sense of primordial destiny.

06:50.880 --> 06:52.803
I don't know.

06:52.880 --> 06:56.009
Maybe he holds a scepter.

(STAMMERS) I'm sorry, I don't...
I don't really follow.

06:58.560 --> 06:59.721

- So did everybody else.

07:14.720 --> 07:16.927
And fucking Marvin
brought us somebody real.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.769
As did Casper and Penny.

07:18.840 --> 07:20.569
I almost signed Alice Cooper.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.484

07:27.880 --> 07:29.291
You can't let me go.

07:29.360 --> 07:30.850

help out in the mail room.

08:24.280 --> 08:27.011
- What?
- This way you're still employed.

08:27.080 --> 08:29.845
You'll messenger shit, run errands,
that kind of thing.

08:29.920 --> 08:32.001
I graduated from fucking Yale.

08:32.080 --> 08:34.207

She usually stumbles in around noon.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.087
Can also have a hairstylist on the day

10:17.520 --> 10:20.330
- Scott Muni at NEW.
- LESTER: What about PLJ?

10:20.400 --> 10:22.846
PLJ, they won't touch them
until they're on the map.

10:22.920 --> 10:25.446
NEW will with a little encouragement.

10:25.560 --> 10:27.483

You go, you have a drink

10:38.280 --> 10:39.486
He'll do an on-air interview.

10:39.560 --> 10:42.848
Yeah, with talking. And eye contact.

Could you write us, like,
half a page about yourself,

-your background?
- What the fuck is this?

you're not secretly loving this.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.482
Wait, does sandwiches just mean food

11:34.560 --> 11:35.607
or does that also mean that I provide

11:35.680 --> 11:37.921
weed and blow for the executive branch?

11:38.000 --> 11:39.490
Just food.

12:29.040 --> 12:32.249
- I'll write it. You don't have to.
- Good, moving on.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.846
Send her to knob the DJs,
'cause I ain't doing that either.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.684
I can come with you,
but that's the whole game.

12:36.760 --> 12:39.240
They'll only send you to rock stations.
And the guys are cool.

12:39.360 --> 12:41.931
You go in, you smoke a joint,
you talk about nothing.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.970
- See? Easy.
- Where's the rest of the band?

12:45.040 --> 12:46.883
That's what I want to know.
Fucking alley-jumped here.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.849
- We wanted a minute with Kip.
- The guys should be here.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.445
They're not here because
I don't want them here.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.522
We're a band. We want to cut a fucking album,

12:52.600 --> 12:54.489
not hairstyling and DJ licking.

12:54.560 --> 12:57.211
Shut your fucking mouth for one second.

12:58.040 --> 13:02.125
Look, you got to make
some personnel changes.

13:02.200 --> 13:04.965
- What?
- You got one guitarist too many.

13:05.040 --> 13:06.451
You should be a foursome.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.443
You're stepping all over each other up there.

13:08.520 --> 13:11.967
And your guy on lead, he's got to go.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.884
- Duck? You fucking...
- What the hell you trying to do?

13:14.960 --> 13:16.883
He's a stiff. No stage presence.

13:16.960 --> 13:19.964
And his guitar playing, mediocre at best.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.849
Come on, they're not technicians.

13:21.920 --> 13:23.410
I mean, playing ain't the focus of their vibe.

13:23.480 --> 13:25.209
No, even for them, he's mediocre.

13:25.280 --> 13:27.601
Take all of this and shove it
up your sagging fuckhole.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.170
JAMIE: You signed the band.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.765
What did you think you were getting?

13:30.840 --> 13:33.366
Him and a couple of other guys.

13:33.440 --> 13:36.011
See, this is what happens

13:36.080 --> 13:38.048
when a label picks you up.

13:38.120 --> 13:40.487
We groom you, we work with you,

13:40.560 --> 13:43.564
we turn you into something
that might actually have a life.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.563
Duck is the band. He came up with the name.

13:45.640 --> 13:48.120
- Sizable contribution.
- He's my friend, you fucking leech.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.202
I'll work with Duck. He'll step up.

13:50.280 --> 13:52.931
He says because of his vast experience
developing bands.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.047
You want to shrink the group?

13:54.120 --> 13:56.009
Is that 'cause your label's run out of money?

13:56.080 --> 13:58.651
Is that it? You haven't got enough to pay us?

14:00.560 --> 14:02.449
You know who Frank Barsalona is?

14:02.520 --> 14:04.807
He runs Premier Talent.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.484
Best booking agency in town.

14:06.560 --> 14:07.846
He's also a friend.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.968
And because he's my friend,

14:10.040 --> 14:12.884
he's booking you to open
for the New York Dolls

14:12.960 --> 14:14.724
next month at the Academy.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.009
- Are you serious?
- RICHIE: Yeah.

14:18.080 --> 14:19.923
So you guys do what you want,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.287
but unless there's suddenly four of them

14:22.360 --> 14:25.569
including a replacement for that fucking lump
they think is a guitarist,

14:25.640 --> 14:26.926
I'm canceling the booking.

14:28.440 --> 14:31.410
And if you ever talk to me like that again,

14:31.480 --> 14:34.450
I'll slap you so hard
you'll be singing out of your asshole.

14:35.920 --> 14:36.921
(CHUCKLES)

14:43.240 --> 14:46.005
Hey, come on, there's people working here.

14:46.080 --> 14:47.809
I'll come back later.

14:55.320 --> 14:56.321
Ah!

14:57.320 --> 14:59.129
Jessie Walsh contract.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.362
Heather is a fucking idiot. I wanted a bialy.

15:01.440 --> 15:03.044
I had to draw a picture for her.

15:03.120 --> 15:05.566
Is there a hole, is there not a hole?

15:05.640 --> 15:08.371
The guy from The <i>Voice</i> needs a quote
for Grand Funk's San Diego show.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.249
Bounce it to Zak. Make him happy.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.084
And they're moving your furniture
back in later.

15:12.160 --> 15:13.446
Do I need a new secretary?

15:15.600 --> 15:16.726
Heather's available.

15:16.800 --> 15:19.565
I got to replace you with a black chick.

15:19.640 --> 15:22.325
Makes me look hipper.
Hepper. Hepper. Hepper?

15:22.440 --> 15:24.442
Neither. Just...

15:24.520 --> 15:27.091
He's not gonna put a ring on your finger.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.640
He's already married. You know that, right?

15:29.720 --> 15:31.290
Hannibal.

15:35.200 --> 15:38.329
He's giving serious thought
to Koronet Records.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.607
Jackie Jervis took him out
again Tuesday night.

15:40.680 --> 15:42.091
Hannibal likes his PR gal.

15:43.120 --> 15:45.122
Andrea? I taught her everything she knows.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.611
She says she can cross him over,

15:46.680 --> 15:48.409
that you're ghettoizing him in the soul market.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.767
If that twat used the word ghettoizing,
I'll kill her.

15:50.840 --> 15:53.446
She's smart.
She had all sorts of ideas, Richie.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.490
You were there. Why didn't you tell me?

15:56.600 --> 15:58.125
I'm telling you now.

16:01.320 --> 16:04.688
You think I could take you
and your little boyfriend out to eat tonight?

16:04.760 --> 16:06.569
Save this fucking place from going under.

16:06.640 --> 16:08.608
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

16:10.080 --> 16:11.081
(DIALING)

16:12.800 --> 16:15.167
You're gonna bring Devon, right?

16:18.160 --> 16:19.844
I'll see what I can do.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.648
You used to be nicer. You know that?

16:26.560 --> 16:27.641
-(PHONE RINGS)
- Hello?

16:27.720 --> 16:30.291
<i>RICHIE: Hey, it's me!</i>

16:30.360 --> 16:31.521
Hi.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.125
You Okay?

16:33.200 --> 16:35.123
I'm fine.

16:35.200 --> 16:37.441
You up for some fondue?

16:37.520 --> 16:40.205
If not, we can fon-don't, go somewhere else.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.566
Tonight?

16:41.640 --> 16:43.688
Yeah, I was thinking maybe Chalet Suisse?

16:43.760 --> 16:45.569
Double date.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.609
Who are you trying to impress?

16:50.800 --> 16:52.484
Hannibal's contract's up.

16:53.720 --> 16:56.690
So it's not so much a date
as a business meeting.

16:56.760 --> 17:00.367
No, it's both, okay? It'll be fun, Dev.

17:00.440 --> 17:03.205
Look, he's a big fish, you know that.

17:03.280 --> 17:05.760
We could use a night together, you and me.

17:05.839 --> 17:08.080
<i>Please? It's important.</i>

17:08.880 --> 17:10.848
Fine, I'll bring the harpoon.

17:10.920 --> 17:13.082
All right, 8:30. Wear something sexy.

17:13.160 --> 17:16.403
MAN: <i>(SINGING) In the evening
by your side</i>

17:16.480 --> 17:19.244
<i>Oh, you're hurting
deep inside</i>

17:19.319 --> 17:21.686
<i>Watch your step
baby...</i>

17:21.760 --> 17:23.808
Andy, it's me.

17:24.520 --> 17:26.170
What are you doing for lunch?

17:28.480 --> 17:29.527
Approach.

17:32.560 --> 17:34.050
I'm putting together a list.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.202
Go shopping with fucking Kip.

17:36.280 --> 17:38.726
Buy him these albums
and then tie him to a chair

17:38.800 --> 17:40.848
and make him listen to this shit
till he can recognize

17:40.920 --> 17:43.571
a chord progression
when it bites him on the ass.

17:43.640 --> 17:45.608
Clark said he's taking my job.

17:45.680 --> 17:48.524
Does that... Are you promoting me?

17:51.360 --> 17:52.850
I brought in the Bits.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.201
Uh-huh.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.561
So...

17:55.640 --> 17:57.802
- No.
- No what?

17:57.880 --> 18:00.247
Clark's doing my job. I signed a band.

18:00.320 --> 18:02.561
Clark was made vice president
in charge of lunch.

18:02.640 --> 18:05.883
You are still vice president
in charge of coffee, correspondence,

18:05.960 --> 18:08.884
and whatever the fuck else you do out there.

18:08.960 --> 18:11.611
So I get nothing for bringing in a band?

18:11.680 --> 18:14.650
No, you work with them
like an A&R person would

18:14.720 --> 18:17.291
and you do your regular job
for which I hired you.

18:17.360 --> 18:18.691
And if you don't fuck it up,

18:18.760 --> 18:20.922
I will note that on my list of naughty and nice.

18:21.240 --> 18:22.969
But, no, there's no promotion.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.482
I just put a bunch of fucking people
out on the street

18:27.560 --> 18:28.721
including support staff.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.649
We're barely hanging on.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.245
Or haven't you noticed?

18:40.520 --> 18:42.045
(MUSIC PLAYING)

18:44.880 --> 18:46.405
MAN: (SINGING) <i>I</i> got

18:46.520 --> 18:47.931
WOMAN: Okay, great. Hold it right there.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.321
ANDREA: The eye lines are fucked up.
Where are they looking?

18:50.440 --> 18:51.885
- Right here, guys.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.246
ANDREA: Carla,
don't be afraid to get in tighter.

18:53.360 --> 18:55.681
- You're shooting the band, not the crane.
-(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)

18:57.440 --> 19:00.205
<i>I got a closet
full of clothes...</i>

19:00.280 --> 19:02.601
How's that?

19:02.680 --> 19:04.762
Tell her I want some close-ups of Scott.

19:04.840 --> 19:07.446
- How's Devon?
- She's great.

19:09.480 --> 19:12.006
She thought we'd be buying a boat
and sailing to the Caribbean,

19:12.080 --> 19:14.401
so, you know, it took her a minute.

19:16.720 --> 19:17.846
She wants to gut me like a fish.

19:17.920 --> 19:20.730
What's she gonna do?
It's never about the money

19:20.800 --> 19:23.326
until you announce that
you're not backing up a Brink's truck.

19:23.400 --> 19:24.731
Then she's a capitalist.

19:24.800 --> 19:27.246
I'm glad that you're not selling.

19:28.160 --> 19:30.003
See, I knew you'd get it.

19:30.080 --> 19:31.844
You busy tonight?

19:31.920 --> 19:34.685
We got dinner,
but we can meet you before for a drink.

19:34.760 --> 19:35.841
Dev would love to see you.

19:35.920 --> 19:38.082
I got a thing. Lou Reed.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.364
When are you gonna get the fuck over it?

19:42.440 --> 19:44.010
You got the biggest fucking balls.

19:44.120 --> 19:45.929
I'm talking about a real job
like you had with Jackie.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.606
You are habituated to
treating me like a hand towel.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.364
You couldn't do otherwise if you wanted to.

19:50.440 --> 19:51.771
Don't give me that line of shit
about abusing you.

19:51.840 --> 19:53.444
You came to my apartment

19:53.520 --> 19:56.524
with fucking options to sign at 11:00 at night.

19:56.600 --> 19:58.250
I didn't tie you to the bed.

19:58.320 --> 20:00.243
It was my idea to fuck you, sweetheart,

20:00.320 --> 20:02.288
it wasn't my idea to clean your bathroom.

20:06.280 --> 20:08.647
Your new secretary clean your fridge?

20:08.720 --> 20:10.927
- No.
-Imagine that.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.685
She doesn't want to answer your phones,
then get on the train,

20:13.760 --> 20:15.888
go up to your apartment,
scrape gravy off the stove?

20:15.960 --> 20:17.485
The stove? The fucking stove?

20:17.560 --> 20:18.925
That's what you're still mad about?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.729
Okay, you know what? This ain't gonna work.

20:20.800 --> 20:23.644
Fine, sorry. Go ahead.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.049
You walk around with a chip on your shoulder

20:26.160 --> 20:27.844
like some encounter group dick swatter,

20:27.920 --> 20:30.446
-you're never gonna...
- I said go ahead.

20:38.360 --> 20:40.408
- Head of publicity.
-(CHUCKLES) No.

20:40.480 --> 20:42.403
What? Why did I buy you a knish?

20:42.480 --> 20:44.528
Your point-of-sale strategies are archaic.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.568
Your marketing makes you look like
a vacuum cleaner company.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.045
- So change it.
- Dark Side of the Moon.

20:48.120 --> 20:50.282
Doesn't have a single on it
and it's a blockbuster.

20:50.360 --> 20:52.328
A prog-rock concept album.

20:52.400 --> 20:55.085
Every mophead in America
can't stop contemplating

20:55.160 --> 20:57.447
the mysteries of that floating fucking triangle.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.249
Pink Floyd doesn't have a face.

20:59.360 --> 21:02.443
Meanwhile, you're still putting head shots
on covers and calling it art.

21:02.520 --> 21:04.841
It makes you look boring.
I can't change that in PR.

21:04.920 --> 21:07.048
That is a revisualization
of the whole company.

21:07.160 --> 21:10.403
Fine, then do it. I'm starting a sublabel, too.
You can run with it.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.562
If you don't have a big idea,
there's not gonna be any difference

21:12.640 --> 21:13.846
between the sublabel and the original.

21:13.960 --> 21:15.200
The idea is new

21:15.280 --> 21:18.523
and not fed through a machine so hard

21:18.600 --> 21:21.888
that you can't feel the fucking intestines
of the artist and the music.

21:22.600 --> 21:23.681
Shit.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.445
I should put that on a T-shirt.

21:27.080 --> 21:29.447
New and alive is subjective.

21:29.520 --> 21:30.965
It's not a vision for a company.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.361
So help me define the fucking idea.

21:34.080 --> 21:35.809
Does that make me a partner?

21:36.880 --> 21:37.881
(SIGHS)

21:39.600 --> 21:41.682
Look, I'll match
whatever Jackie was giving you

21:41.760 --> 21:42.966
and I'll up it 20%.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.724
I'm not coming in to be your PR girl.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.848
That's not growth for me. It's a fucking insult.

21:46.920 --> 21:49.400
You'll call the shots on big ideas.

21:49.480 --> 21:51.767
Baby, you couldn't follow through on that
if you wanted to.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.729
You'll have a voice, okay?

21:55.800 --> 21:57.165
I'm different, Andy.

22:00.720 --> 22:01.926
One second.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.809
I love you, babe.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.245
I always have.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.729
I'm meeting Mrs. Fineman.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.882
Oh, yes. Follow me, please.

22:34.200 --> 22:35.611
Sorry I'm late.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.728
Someone threw themselves
in front of the 6 train.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.206
Madame.

22:43.280 --> 22:45.089
I take veal. You have a soup?

22:45.160 --> 22:48.562
Serving a potato leek soup
and a beef consommé.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.130
I'll have consommé.

22:51.680 --> 22:53.842
Uh, the chicken, please.

22:53.920 --> 22:55.160
Nothing to start.

22:55.240 --> 22:56.810
- And consommé.
- No, I'm fine.

22:56.880 --> 22:58.848
I don't want the consommé.

23:04.800 --> 23:05.801
(SPEAKING POLISH)

23:06.920 --> 23:08.081
I'm not gonna go in there again.

23:08.160 --> 23:09.207

23:10.320 --> 23:11.810
No one had alcohol.

23:12.160 --> 23:13.161
(SPEAKING POLISH)

23:13.840 --> 23:16.650
I would have cleaned up the cigarette butts,
but you didn't give me a chance.

23:16.800 --> 23:17.801
(SPEAKING POLISH)

23:18.240 --> 23:19.844
If I had burned it down,

23:19.960 --> 23:21.724
at least you'd have had the insurance money.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.131
I wouldn't have to hear how the business

23:23.200 --> 23:24.850
-is such a millstone around your neck.
-(SPEAKING POLISH)

23:31.920 --> 23:33.843
There's your key.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.041

23:38.400 --> 23:39.925
They're musicians.

23:53.360 --> 23:54.361
(SPEAKING POLISH)

23:57.760 --> 24:00.127
You didn't need anyone to take care of you.

If I have to hear about you

24:04.280 --> 24:06.169
sucking off the Hitler Youth again,
I'm gonna throw myself...

24:06.240 --> 24:09.323
Close your mouth
before I stab you in the throat.

24:16.720 --> 24:18.722
I got a promotion at work.

24:19.920 --> 24:22.969
There's people who type letters
and bring coffee

24:23.040 --> 24:24.929
and then there's people
who work with the artists.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.207
I will retire one day.
If you cannot take the business...

24:27.280 --> 24:29.521
They fired a bunch of people.

24:29.600 --> 24:31.568
Not only did they keep me,
but they made me a...

24:31.640 --> 24:33.051
You're an embarrassment.

VINCE: Twelve or thirteen.

-(LAUGHTER)
- He's got the Philco blasting,

24:54.720 --> 24:57.849
stark naked in front of a mirror

24:57.920 --> 25:01.561
singing, "Josefina, please don't
lean-a on the bell.

"When you smooch-a,

Hey!

25:06.880 --> 25:07.881
Oh.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.969
Look who decides to show up.

25:10.040 --> 25:11.849
5:30, we said.

25:13.440 --> 25:15.204
Uh, I got to get home

25:15.280 --> 25:18.045
-to hear the liar address the nation.
-(CHUCKLES)

25:18.160 --> 25:20.367
- Shit.
- So nice to meet you.

25:21.640 --> 25:23.369
It's a real pleasure.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.090
Oh, beautiful.

25:25.160 --> 25:27.162
- Gonna need to change, so...
- Thank you.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.680
A fucking zoo, Broadway.

25:30.760 --> 25:33.127
The goddamn rush hour.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.726
Panhandlers every three feet.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.245
Drinking bourbon?

25:37.320 --> 25:39.527
The girl said there's no rye.

25:39.640 --> 25:40.766
Bourbon or scotch?

25:47.120 --> 25:48.645
There's gold everywhere.

25:48.720 --> 25:50.768
The lost city of the Incas.

25:50.840 --> 25:53.844
Yes, you made that very same observation
the last time you were here.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.160
Maybe next time
you should cut your pecker off,

25:55.280 --> 25:56.361
hang that on the wall.

25:56.440 --> 25:58.408
They're achievements, Pop.
I'm proud of them.

25:58.480 --> 26:01.370
<i>Mairzy Doats</i> sold three million copies.
What does that prove?

26:01.440 --> 26:04.410
That not everything has to be
Mozart or Thelonious Monk.

26:04.480 --> 26:07.962
I'm changing course,
taking the label in a new direction.

26:08.040 --> 26:10.247
I signed this band, Pop.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.049
They have an energy.

26:12.120 --> 26:13.406
It's electric.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.810
The fuck do I know?

26:15.880 --> 26:17.882
I'm just an old horn player.

26:24.160 --> 26:26.322
How are your fingers? Your arthritis?

26:27.040 --> 26:30.249
The Bufferin now, it's easier on the stomach.

26:30.320 --> 26:32.129
Maybe lay off the rye.

26:32.200 --> 26:34.089
You gonna lecture me now?

26:34.160 --> 26:36.766
No, it runs in families. It's not a lecture.

26:36.840 --> 26:38.922
Your mother's, maybe, not mine.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.731
It's a known fact
mulattos can't hold their liquor.

26:41.800 --> 26:44.724
- That wasn't her problem.
-I'd come home, she'd be soused.

26:44.800 --> 26:47.849
Staring off, listening to Arthur Godfrey.

26:47.960 --> 26:49.530
She was depressed.

26:50.080 --> 26:53.289
By the way,
when the fuck were you ever home?

26:53.360 --> 26:55.806
Since when are you father of the year?

26:55.880 --> 26:58.360
- The dope, the whores.
- I don't run around.

26:58.440 --> 27:00.966
Flying around in jet planes
like Joe fucking Big Shot

27:01.040 --> 27:03.247
and now this trouble with the law.

27:04.040 --> 27:05.451
You love this, don't you?

27:09.920 --> 27:11.922
It's my fault you got mixed up in this shit?

27:12.000 --> 27:13.286
I'm not mixed up with anything.

27:13.400 --> 27:15.129
Ah. Then Why'd you need me for an alibi?

27:15.200 --> 27:17.328
Look, it was a misunderstanding.

27:17.400 --> 27:19.323
Okay, Buck Rogers, the dead guy,

27:19.400 --> 27:21.323
he was a friend of mine

27:21.400 --> 27:23.971
and I'm the last person he called
before they murdered him.

27:24.040 --> 27:26.930
- It's a coincidence.
- Where were you that you needed me to lie?

27:27.040 --> 27:28.769
Out.

27:28.840 --> 27:31.047
Doing something that I'm not proud of, okay?

27:31.120 --> 27:33.726
On the phone you said it was an accident.

27:33.800 --> 27:36.883
Well, obviously it was an accident
of some kind.

27:36.960 --> 27:38.200
But it doesn't mean I was involved.

27:38.280 --> 27:40.328
Oh, you got all the answers, don't you?

27:40.400 --> 27:43.847
Big record man, fancy house,
built-in swimming pool.

27:43.920 --> 27:45.206
MY proud papa.

27:45.280 --> 27:47.487
The fuck I give a shit what anybody else has?

27:47.600 --> 27:49.170
Oh, please, Pop. Come on.

27:49.240 --> 27:51.163
Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw.

27:51.240 --> 27:53.208
Artie Shaw was an asshole!

27:53.280 --> 27:54.964
Artie Shaw gave you a career

27:55.040 --> 27:57.520
which you fucking drank away.

28:02.040 --> 28:03.849
It'd be nice...

28:04.800 --> 28:06.962
If I could see my grandchildren
every once in a while.

28:08.440 --> 28:09.726
Fine.

28:10.520 --> 28:12.249
We'll have you out to the house.

28:13.800 --> 28:15.529
The one with the in-ground pool.

28:18.400 --> 28:20.482
I'm sorry about your friend.

28:23.480 --> 28:26.245
I hope the cops catch who did it.

I'm not doing it.

I hardly knew him.

- Get off your bloody amp.
- Why?

30:37.600 --> 30:39.887
-'Cause I'm asking.
- I always sit on my amp.

30:39.960 --> 30:41.610
I'm keenly aware of that, Duck,
but if you stood,

30:41.680 --> 30:43.364
you might find
you'll be a little more connected.

30:43.440 --> 30:46.011
- Connected to what?
- The music.

30:46.080 --> 30:48.447
The band. The grit in your anus.

30:48.520 --> 30:51.649
- It's a demo, man.

RICHIE: So she's playing Cassandra.
DEVON: Ophelia.

31:48.080 --> 31:52.085
And at the end she's supposed to
drown herself in the river, right?

31:52.160 --> 31:54.242
But this is fucking avant-garde theater,

31:54.320 --> 31:56.163
so, you know, the river ain't water

31:56.240 --> 31:58.607
or papier-mâché or some shit.

31:58.680 --> 32:00.364
No, it's guys.

I'm playing my death scene,
he's about to rush the stage.

32:10.560 --> 32:12.210
- You could see him?
- Oh, yeah.

32:12.280 --> 32:14.408
He's got that thing with his jaw that he does

32:14.480 --> 32:16.608
and the throbbing vein in his neck.

32:16.680 --> 32:18.364
I had to make sure
nobody was grabbing her tits,

32:18.440 --> 32:19.771
which they were.

32:19.840 --> 32:22.605
- The fucking Canadian.
- He was gay. They all were.

32:22.680 --> 32:25.570
Yeah, a lot of groping around
for a bunch of queers.

32:25.640 --> 32:27.608
I want to be that river.

Oh, God, that's ancient history.

I don't know. Got to find you another one.

32:37.520 --> 32:39.409
DEVON: No, I'm done.

32:39.480 --> 32:41.244
Cece's a baby, though.

32:41.320 --> 32:42.481
She should be a star of the stage.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.085
- There we go.
- Uh-uh.

32:44.160 --> 32:46.162
- Come on, Sweet Catch Me.
- Stop it, now.

32:46.240 --> 32:49.562
Sweet Catch Me likes to play shy,
but it's just an act.

32:49.640 --> 32:51.449
Sweet Catch Me, huh?

32:51.520 --> 32:53.443
It's an anagram of my name.

- Ooh.

33:18.920 --> 33:20.285
RICHIE: What's that supposed to mean?

33:20.360 --> 33:22.727
Means you better hold on tight
before your dove run off.

-(LAUGHTER)

33:24.920 --> 33:27.287

Terrifies China.

33:31.840 --> 33:34.571
Well, they do hate me
in that noodle place on 57th.

Racist fire? Come on, man.

I'm taking out girls of every color
of the rainbow.

33:46.960 --> 33:49.361
That's right. And if that's the fire,

33:49.440 --> 33:51.886
get me out of the frying pan, yeah.

34:11.040 --> 34:12.768
What do you think?

34:13.960 --> 34:15.643
Could cut him out of the mix.

34:17.320 --> 34:18.969
But, really, he's no worse than the others.

34:28.320 --> 34:29.481
Dinner.

34:31.239 --> 34:33.481
Nice work, fellas. That's dinner.

34:34.880 --> 34:36.848
See you in a bit.

34:41.760 --> 34:43.170
You feel like Indian?

34:43.239 --> 34:45.402
I got to run home. Left my notebook.

34:45.520 --> 34:46.601
Your notebook's right there.

34:46.679 --> 34:48.648
I got a new one.

34:48.719 --> 34:50.290
New one's got me quality lyrics in it.

35:33.520 --> 35:35.249
I worked in a bowling alley.

35:35.360 --> 35:37.806
- Can you get that job back?
- I don't know. Probably.

35:37.880 --> 35:39.962
Then you should do that,
'cause I'm afraid this ain't working out.

35:40.920 --> 35:42.331
You fucking firing me?

35:42.400 --> 35:44.926
- You can't do that.
- I'm just the messenger.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.571
- Kip put you up to this?
- No, this is above Kip.

35:47.640 --> 35:49.802
- Goes all the way up the flagpole.
- But why?

35:49.880 --> 35:52.281
You're not in a rec room anymore.

35:52.360 --> 35:54.203
At this level, they are taking pictures.

35:54.280 --> 35:56.647

to put you up in front of a crowd.

35:59.640 --> 36:00.926

37:29.960 --> 37:32.440

47:55.720 --> 47:57.927
and I'm giving it to you... Authority, vision.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.082
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Unless that was all bullshit

48:00.160 --> 48:02.322
and you just wanted to get married.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.685
Why would I want to marry
someone who didn't love me?

48:07.760 --> 48:10.684
I loved you, okay? I loved Devon, too.

48:10.760 --> 48:12.569
Sue me, it was fucked up.

48:12.640 --> 48:14.051
You made a decision, though, didn't you?

48:14.160 --> 48:16.242
- Yeah, I did.
- She was easy.

48:16.320 --> 48:18.129
She didn't call you on your shit.

48:18.200 --> 48:20.009
That's why.

48:20.080 --> 48:22.287
You didn't want to be with somebody
who was as smart as you.

48:22.360 --> 48:24.362
It's an unattractive quality in you.

48:24.440 --> 48:26.647
But let me tell you something.
It helped in the end, seeing that.

48:26.720 --> 48:28.245
Okay.

48:28.320 --> 48:29.765
No?

48:29.840 --> 48:31.729
Whatever.

48:31.800 --> 48:34.087
- So why?
-It doesn't fucking matter.

48:34.160 --> 48:35.241
Say why.

48:38.040 --> 48:40.088
You're right. I wanted somebody dumber.

48:40.160 --> 48:42.003
If that is not why, say why.

48:42.080 --> 48:43.684
Because she was more beautiful.

48:51.040 --> 48:52.326
Thank you.

48:52.400 --> 48:54.368
You know how many years I wondered that?

48:59.520 --> 49:02.364
- Andy, you're a beautiful woman.
- Okay.

49:02.440 --> 49:04.124
You look like me.

49:05.520 --> 49:07.329
You do.

49:07.400 --> 49:10.290
It's like narcissism or something.

49:10.360 --> 49:12.601
I don't know. You're like my family.

49:12.720 --> 49:14.210
Okay, stop.

49:15.560 --> 49:17.050
Jesus.

49:17.680 --> 49:19.284
What, are you gonna cry?

49:19.360 --> 49:20.486
Fuck you.

49:25.360 --> 49:27.010
I could do it.

49:28.360 --> 49:30.681
- The job?
- I could think about it.

49:30.760 --> 49:32.649
But you give me an ownership stake.

49:33.720 --> 49:35.688
And I'm not your mother or your extra wife.

49:35.760 --> 49:38.127
- Done.
- I don't take care of you.

49:38.200 --> 49:39.611
I take care of the company.

49:39.680 --> 49:42.047
You puke on your clothes, I don't give a shit.

49:42.120 --> 49:43.201
I have a secretary. Got it.

49:43.280 --> 49:45.282
You rolling off the wagon?

49:45.360 --> 49:47.328
Go with God.

49:47.400 --> 49:49.721
The guy in the hat, he's got dots.

49:49.840 --> 49:51.729
The girl in the gold top, she's a cokehead.

49:51.840 --> 49:53.444
She'll let you do blow out of her navel.

49:53.520 --> 49:55.124
Go to fucking town.

49:57.640 --> 49:58.641
And)'-

50:01.320 --> 50:03.527
We're gonna do something great.

50:04.800 --> 50:06.768
Leave me alone.

50:06.840 --> 50:08.729
Ronnie Lang's my lawyer now.

50:08.800 --> 50:10.370
Figure it outwith him.

50:10.440 --> 50:12.647
Don't call me 'till it's done.

50:12.720 --> 50:15.371
In fact, don't ever call me at home.

50:15.440 --> 50:17.408
