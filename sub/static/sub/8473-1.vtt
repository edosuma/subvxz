01:12.705 --> 01:16.072
Listen, I'm from the Bronx,
so you need to keep it simple.

01:16.276 --> 01:20.440
Why is the bank buying all this
missile-guidance stuff from Calvini?

01:22.315 --> 01:23.543
I don't get it.

01:54.214 --> 01:55.841
The window will stay closed.

01:59.352 --> 02:00.683
You need to relax.

02:01.254 --> 02:04.007
I'm more
comfortable tense.

02:05.258 --> 02:07.283
You came to us, remember?

02:07.494 --> 02:09.655
You wanted a way out
and I'm offering you one.

02:09.863 --> 02:12.627
I only met you 30 minutes ago...

02:12.832 --> 02:17.326
...and now you expect me just
to walk away from everything I know...

02:17.637 --> 02:19.662
...put my life in your hands.

02:21.341 --> 02:24.833
You want a little more time
to think things through, I get it...

02:25.278 --> 02:27.109
...but we're gonna need
another meet...

02:28.047 --> 02:30.208
...and I'm gonna need to
see some paper.

02:32.652 --> 02:35.815
Yes. Now get out of the car.

02:58.578 --> 02:59.636
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Ella?

02:59.846 --> 03:01.643
- <i>You done?</i>
- Yeah, I just met with him.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.146
- <i>And?</i>
- Oh, he's real.

03:04.384 --> 03:06.545
He's real enough
to blow this thing wide open.

03:06.753 --> 03:09.085
He told me the bank's
buying $200 million worth...

03:09.289 --> 03:11.154
...of missile-guidance systems.

03:11.391 --> 03:13.689
- <i>What do they need those for?</i>
- I don't know.

03:13.893 --> 03:15.326
<i>You gonna see him a second time?</i>

03:15.528 --> 03:19.726
Yeah, yeah. Listen, we're gonna meet
again. He's agreed to bring me paper.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.730
Right, I'll call you later.

03:22.168 --> 03:23.965
Thanks, Elle.

03:47.460 --> 03:48.757
Hey.

04:16.022 --> 04:19.514
Are you experiencing
any blurred or double vision?

04:20.226 --> 04:21.988
No.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.085
Nothing.

04:24.497 --> 04:25.896
Just follow the light, please.

04:31.904 --> 04:35.271
It's been noted that you were
experiencing ringing in your ears.

04:35.708 --> 04:36.697
Yes.

04:36.909 --> 04:39.742
Well, I would like to keep you here
overnight for observation.

04:39.946 --> 04:42.176
That won't be necessary.

04:45.852 --> 04:47.717
Where's my colleague?

04:51.891 --> 04:53.017
Thomas Schumer.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.496
It was definitely a heart attack?

05:09.609 --> 05:12.476
"Acute myocardial infarction." Yes.

05:26.959 --> 05:29.018
Your penlight, can I use it?

05:42.241 --> 05:43.230
What are you doing?

05:43.976 --> 05:45.500
Can you help me turn him over?

05:45.712 --> 05:48.545
- I'm afraid I can't allow you to...
- Just help me.

06:08.234 --> 06:11.670
We need to contact the Berlin police
and request an immediate autopsy.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.236
Why?

06:13.706 --> 06:16.698
Because I don't think this man
died of natural causes.

06:17.410 --> 06:18.604
Come on, Ella.

06:18.811 --> 06:21.871
If Schumer met this insider
in Berlin...

06:22.081 --> 06:24.743
...odds are this guy's
a foreign national. So it's federal.

06:24.951 --> 06:27.317
But you're not listening to me.
Let them meet again.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.988
The guy's gonna bring paper
and Tommy will close him.

06:30.189 --> 06:34.125
You still have to coordinate with
Justice if you want witness protection.

06:34.327 --> 06:37.057
I just tried both their cells again.
Straight to voicemail.

06:37.263 --> 06:38.423
Shit.

06:38.631 --> 06:41.964
I'm gonna try Tommy's wife at work.
If I have to bring DOJ into this...

06:42.168 --> 06:45.035
...they're gonna do what they've
always done with this.

06:45.238 --> 06:48.105
They're gonna stall us with red tape,
informant's gonna bolt...

06:48.307 --> 06:50.707
...and I'm telling you,
he could be the bombshell...

06:50.910 --> 06:53.435
...we've spent the last two years
looking for.

06:54.180 --> 06:55.943
Voicemail.

06:57.183 --> 06:59.549
What's going on?
Why aren't they calling us back?

06:59.752 --> 07:02.653
What do you want me to do?
I can't afford another turf war.

07:02.855 --> 07:06.791
- It's Salinger.
- Finally. Put him on speaker.

07:08.961 --> 07:12.397
Jesus, Lou.
What took you guys so long?

07:14.033 --> 07:16.433
Hello? You there?

07:16.636 --> 07:18.103
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:18.304 --> 07:20.238
So, what's up?

07:21.607 --> 07:23.598
<i>Tommy's dead.</i>

07:25.278 --> 07:26.472
What?

07:30.316 --> 07:32.011
<i>He's dead, Ella.</i>

07:32.218 --> 07:34.914
<i>I need you to get over here</i>
<i>as soon as you can.</i>

07:36.889 --> 07:40.518
Unnaturally red blood,
lambent membranes.

07:40.726 --> 07:42.956
Two key indicators
of hydrocyanic poisoning.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.663
This lesion on the neck...

07:44.864 --> 07:48.391
...is how the poison was introduced
into the bloodstream, percutaneously.

07:48.601 --> 07:50.626
The lesion tested negative
for any poison.

07:50.837 --> 07:54.295
There are any number of reasons
for this discoloration of the blood...

07:54.507 --> 07:56.475
...least likely of which
is hydrocyanic...

07:56.676 --> 07:58.667
I'm telling you, he was murdered.

08:05.518 --> 08:08.487
Well, I'm assuming
you suspect a combination...

08:08.688 --> 08:10.713
...of prussic acid and DMSO...

08:11.591 --> 08:14.116
...but then the reaction time
would have been immediate.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.124
Within one minute.

08:16.329 --> 08:19.093
Which means the killer
would have had to deliver the toxin...

08:19.298 --> 08:21.528
...after Schumer exited the car.

08:27.373 --> 08:30.570
So did you see anything unusual?

08:30.776 --> 08:33.301
Anybody approaching Schumer?

08:36.349 --> 08:38.578
No. I mean...

08:40.919 --> 08:42.683
I don't know.

08:43.121 --> 08:46.421
What is it that makes you so certain
he was assassinated?

08:53.432 --> 08:56.629
Agent Salinger and I have reason
to believe this might be connected...

08:56.836 --> 08:59.066
...to an ongoing investigation
being conducted...

08:59.272 --> 09:02.435
...by both my team at the Manhattan
DA's office and Interpol.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.241
- What investigation?
- I run a group at Interpol...

09:05.444 --> 09:08.902
...that focuses on financial operations
associated with organized crime.

09:09.448 --> 09:12.474
About two years ago, we began
receiving correlated intelligence...

09:12.685 --> 09:16.246
...regarding the illicit activities of
a bank based out of Luxembourg...

09:16.455 --> 09:18.753
...the International Bank
of Business and Credit.

09:18.958 --> 09:21.825
Under the direction of its chairman,
Jonas Skarssen...

09:22.028 --> 09:24.929
...we believe the IBBC has quietly
become the bank of choice...

09:25.131 --> 09:27.998
...for monies associated with
organized crime, capital flight...

09:28.200 --> 09:32.034
How is any of this related to Schumer
and the New York DA's office?

09:32.238 --> 09:33.603
The IBBC's Manhattan branch...

09:33.806 --> 09:36.798
...is the epicenter of its U.S.
money-laundering operation.

09:37.009 --> 09:39.477
Schumer and I
were working this case together.

09:39.679 --> 09:42.273
Agent Salinger and his department
have been assisting us.

09:42.481 --> 09:45.882
Why weren't we informed
of these details prior to this briefing?

10:06.472 --> 10:08.804
What was Schumer doing
here in Berlin?

10:09.208 --> 10:11.768
I set him up on a blind date
with an IBBC executive...

10:11.978 --> 10:14.970
...who was aware of our investigation
and looking to make a deal.

10:15.181 --> 10:17.342
And the identity of this informant?

10:17.550 --> 10:21.077
We don't know. He took precautions
to keep his identity anonymous.

10:21.587 --> 10:24.181
For the past 12 hours,
I've been trying hard to find him.

10:24.390 --> 10:27.518
I believe that if this man isn't
already dead, he soon will be.

10:27.927 --> 10:29.087
Why?

10:29.528 --> 10:31.860
Because, just like Schumer...

10:32.198 --> 10:34.860
...anyone that's in a position
to move against this bank...

10:35.067 --> 10:37.001
...has either ended up dead
or disappeared.

10:37.837 --> 10:41.967
Agent Salinger,
given your history with this matter...

10:42.174 --> 10:44.335
...I should think
you would be more careful...

10:44.543 --> 10:46.977
...before making
such extreme accusations.

10:47.179 --> 10:49.409
My history?
What are you talking about?

10:49.615 --> 10:51.606
We've reviewed your dossier.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.112
Have you?

10:55.454 --> 10:58.048
Well, that means you know
just about shit.

11:01.027 --> 11:06.226
I realize this is a trying time
for you both, but until I'm provided...

11:06.432 --> 11:09.629
...with something more compelling
than unsubstantiated theories...

11:10.403 --> 11:14.772
...pursuing the IBBC is simply
not going to happen here in Germany.

11:22.715 --> 11:25.183
Concorde Hotel, please.

11:30.723 --> 11:34.159
What was that back there? What
history was Diemer talking about?

11:34.360 --> 11:36.089
- Don't worry.
- Don't give me that shit.

11:36.295 --> 11:39.025
- What do they know that I don't?
- They don't know anything.

11:39.231 --> 11:40.664
Enough to get a rise out of you.

11:40.866 --> 11:44.529
I'm not getting into it.
You're so curious, read my file.

11:48.874 --> 11:51.866
I should never have let Tommy
walk into this.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.442
You didn't. I approved the meet.

11:54.647 --> 11:57.081
I was across the fucking street, Ella.

11:58.951 --> 12:01.112
I was right there.

12:04.090 --> 12:06.320
I saw him go down.

12:07.593 --> 12:09.185
I didn't see a thing.

12:14.533 --> 12:17.297
We won't let them bury this, Lou.

14:12.785 --> 14:15.310
This canvas appeals to you?

14:16.388 --> 14:18.856
I like the look of agony.

14:20.626 --> 14:22.253
Why?

14:23.229 --> 14:25.697
Because I know it's true.

14:34.540 --> 14:35.598
What am I doing here?

14:36.675 --> 14:39.405
Umberto Calvini is disengaging
from the deal.

14:39.945 --> 14:44.348
Your principle would like to bring
you in to troubleshoot the situation.

14:45.451 --> 14:49.410
If Calvini refuses to move forward, my
involvement won't make a difference.

14:49.622 --> 14:52.955
Your involvement would allow them
to appeal to Calvini's two sons...

14:53.158 --> 14:55.183
...who are much more open-minded.

14:56.595 --> 14:59.428
You'll find all the details in the file.

15:08.540 --> 15:11.566
I'll contact you
once negotiations are underway.

15:32.698 --> 15:34.791
IBBC executive dies
in freak road accident

15:49.081 --> 15:51.811
Luxembourg high society in shock
at death of André Clément

16:09.101 --> 16:10.466
Rene?

16:11.670 --> 16:13.695
What are you doing here so early?

16:13.906 --> 16:15.168
Salinger.

16:28.454 --> 16:29.648
I found the insider.

16:30.489 --> 16:31.649
What?

16:32.725 --> 16:35.660
I found the guy that Schumer
met with in Berlin.

16:36.829 --> 16:37.887
André Clément?

16:38.097 --> 16:41.157
The IBBC's senior vice president
of acquisitions.

16:46.538 --> 16:49.200
He was killed in a road accident
just outside Luxembourg...

16:49.408 --> 16:51.638
...approximately nine hours
after Schumer's death.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.540
And this is the gendarmerie's
preliminary accident report.

16:55.781 --> 16:57.976
He arrived in Berlin at 8 a. m...

16:58.917 --> 17:01.715
...on Luxair, Flight 9871
from Luxembourg.

17:02.287 --> 17:05.744
What doesn't track is in his statement,
the IBBC chairman, Jonas Skarssen...

17:05.958 --> 17:09.358
...claims that Clément had been with
him in Luxembourg since 10 a. m...

17:09.560 --> 17:13.258
...which is obviously impossible
if Clément arrived in Berlin at 8 a.m.

17:13.699 --> 17:16.566
Did the gendarmerie say anything
about this inconsistency?

17:17.336 --> 17:18.701
Nothing.

17:18.904 --> 17:20.666
- I haven't told them.
- What?

17:20.873 --> 17:23.501
I wanna go to Luxembourg
and question Skarssen myself.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.643
- No. Absolutely no.
- Viktor, listen to me.

17:25.844 --> 17:28.677
I go to Luxembourg,
Skarssen confirms that statement...

17:28.881 --> 17:30.849
...I catch him in that lie,
I can build...

17:31.050 --> 17:33.678
For chrissake, Lou,
you're not at the Yard anymore.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.548
Interpol is not
in the law-enforcement business.

17:37.423 --> 17:39.721
We deal in intelligence
and facilitation.

17:40.259 --> 17:44.389
Focus on that, work that and pass your
take onto the appropriate authorities.

17:44.596 --> 17:45.688
And then what?

17:46.899 --> 17:50.198
You know we've been circulating
our take since the very beginning.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.563
No one ever does anything,
no one ever can.

17:52.771 --> 17:56.434
Whatever case we have gets lost
in the complexities of international law.

17:57.609 --> 18:01.306
Schumer, Clément...

18:01.513 --> 18:04.107
...this entire fucking wall.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.947
There's nothing that complex
about cold-blooded murder.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.933
Hi. I've got an appointment
with Mr. Skarssen.

18:30.142 --> 18:34.272
- Your name, please?
- Mr. Salinger? Please follow me.

19:16.722 --> 19:17.711
Mr. Skarssen.

19:23.195 --> 19:24.856
Mr. Skarssen.

19:31.537 --> 19:33.664
Agent Salinger? Please follow me.

19:51.256 --> 19:53.156
Mr. White.

19:53.458 --> 19:56.655
Agent Salinger.
I apologize for the wait.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.831
I'm Martin White,
the IBBC's legal counsel.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.330
This is Commissioner Villon
of the gendarmerie.

20:02.534 --> 20:06.231
I thought it useful for him to join us,
considering the nature of your query.

20:06.438 --> 20:08.030
Please, have a seat.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.938
I think there's
some misunderstanding.

20:12.144 --> 20:14.942
I'm here to speak with Mr. Skarssen.

20:15.147 --> 20:19.413
Yes, but as Mr. Skarssen's attorney,
I insisted that I speak with you first.

20:19.851 --> 20:23.252
Mr. White, I had a confirmed meeting
with Mr. Skarssen at 11:00.

20:23.655 --> 20:26.522
If I was gonna meet with you first,
why didn't anybody tell me?

20:26.725 --> 20:29.319
I understand,
and I'm sorry for the confusion...

20:29.528 --> 20:32.588
...but I'm sure I can help
answer your questions.

20:32.798 --> 20:35.562
Now, please, have a seat.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.483
As I'm sure you're aware...

20:57.689 --> 20:59.919
...I have some questions
regarding André Clément.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.158
Yes.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.828
It's my understanding
that Mr. Clément was working...

21:06.031 --> 21:08.966
...at Mr. Skarssen's residence
the night he was killed.

21:09.167 --> 21:11.658
The night of the accident, yes.

21:12.771 --> 21:15.137
What time did he arrive
at Skarssen's home that day?

21:15.340 --> 21:18.707
If I recall correctly, around 6 p.m.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.112
- You were there?
- Yes.

21:25.751 --> 21:27.378
And you're certain about this time?

21:28.353 --> 21:29.877
Quite.

21:30.455 --> 21:32.184
I'm confused.

21:33.659 --> 21:36.423
What you're telling me conflicts
with Skarssen's statement...

21:36.628 --> 21:38.789
...in the gendarmerie's
accident report...

21:38.997 --> 21:42.091
...which was that Clément had been
working with him since 10 a.m.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.433
I was present when Mr. Skarssen
gave his statement.

21:45.637 --> 21:48.663
- That is not what he said.
- It is according to this report.

21:50.509 --> 21:52.136
May I?

22:10.929 --> 22:12.988
There is an error
in the preliminary draft.

22:13.198 --> 22:14.187
The time is wrong.

22:15.934 --> 22:19.734
The finalized report here
says Clément arrived at 6 p.m.

22:20.372 --> 22:23.341
Clerical errors like this
can happen from time to time.

22:23.542 --> 22:26.010
This is why the gendarmerie
discourages the release...

22:26.211 --> 22:29.408
...of any preliminary documentation
pertaining to open cases.

22:31.483 --> 22:35.078
So is there anything else
we can do for you, Agent Salinger?

22:45.597 --> 22:46.586
- Yeah.
- <i>It's me.</i>

22:46.798 --> 22:49.631
<i>I just got the results from</i>
<i>the tox analysis I ran on Schumer.</i>

22:49.835 --> 22:52.827
- And?
- <i>It's inconclusive.</i>

22:53.038 --> 22:55.472
Inconclusive? What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

22:55.674 --> 22:58.234
<i>They found trace elements</i>
<i>of cyanide in his blood...</i>

22:58.443 --> 23:00.536
<i>... but the levels</i>
<i>are not nearly high enough...</i>

23:00.746 --> 23:03.180
<i>... to meet their criteria</i>
<i>for poisoning.</i>

23:05.050 --> 23:06.244
<i>Are you there?</i>

23:25.303 --> 23:26.895
Sorry.

23:29.274 --> 23:31.242
I'm sorry.

23:34.446 --> 23:36.539
Are you crazy?

23:59.838 --> 24:01.100
Madame Clément?

24:04.176 --> 24:07.339
It's Eleanor Whitman from the
New York District Attorney's office.

24:08.113 --> 24:10.479
I already left a couple
messages just...

24:29.701 --> 24:31.862
Mrs. Clément,
I'm sorry to keep calling you.

24:32.070 --> 24:35.506
I can only imagine what a difficult time
this must be for you.

24:36.475 --> 24:40.275
But I'm not convinced your
husband's death was an accident.

24:42.347 --> 24:44.008
Look, here's my cell number.

24:44.216 --> 24:49.449
001-917-135-6565.

24:49.654 --> 24:51.053
You can call any time...

24:51.256 --> 24:55.716
<i>Stop calling me. I have nothing</i>
<i>to say to you. Just leave me alone.</i>

24:55.927 --> 24:58.725
Please. I just need to ask you
a few questions.

24:58.930 --> 25:01.558
<i>I have two children.</i>
<i>They've already lost their father.</i>

25:01.766 --> 25:05.725
- I understand.
- <i>No, you don't.</i>

25:08.039 --> 25:10.564
Are you aware your husband
met with our investigators...

25:10.775 --> 25:12.504
...the day he was killed?

25:20.519 --> 25:22.350
You ever planning to come to bed?

25:23.154 --> 25:25.714
- I heard your voice.
- I'm sorry.

25:25.924 --> 25:28.358
- When'd he come in here?
- An hour ago.

25:29.060 --> 25:30.823
<i>T. rex</i> was in the closet again.

25:32.297 --> 25:34.162
Let me take him back.

25:34.933 --> 25:36.833
Come on, buddy.

27:15.700 --> 27:16.689
Lou?

27:17.302 --> 27:19.361
They knew about
the discrepancy in the report.

27:19.571 --> 27:22.062
They had Skarssen's
statement changed.

27:22.273 --> 27:23.638
How did they know, Viktor?

27:24.843 --> 27:25.867
- Come inside.
- No.

27:28.446 --> 27:31.006
Are you insane? It's freezing out.

27:31.349 --> 27:32.680
Come outside.

27:32.884 --> 27:34.442
Stop it!

27:41.826 --> 27:43.589
Lou, wait.

27:45.163 --> 27:46.187
Lou.

27:49.100 --> 27:51.193
Have you lost your mind?

28:05.250 --> 28:07.650
I think we take the dog for a walk.

28:08.019 --> 28:10.010
Get some fresh air.

28:21.833 --> 28:23.391
Who did this?

28:23.601 --> 28:24.932
Who do you think?

28:26.071 --> 28:27.197
From my apartment.

28:27.906 --> 28:30.033
Whitman's got them too.

28:30.575 --> 28:32.975
We need to inform
the secretary general immediately.

28:33.178 --> 28:34.338
You gotta be kidding.

28:34.546 --> 28:37.174
We start setting off alarms,
the opportunity will be lost.

28:37.382 --> 28:38.406
Opportunity?

28:38.616 --> 28:40.208
The last thing Schumer told Ella...

28:40.418 --> 28:44.787
...was that Clément was giving him
information on an IBBC arms deal.

28:47.058 --> 28:48.218
Umberto Calvini.

28:48.426 --> 28:51.691
Chairman of Calvini Defense, one
of the largest defense contractors.

28:51.896 --> 28:54.296
And probably
Italy's next prime minister.

28:54.499 --> 28:57.195
This guy standing next to him,
that's our insider.

28:58.103 --> 28:59.263
André Clément.

29:00.105 --> 29:01.595
And?

29:01.806 --> 29:04.673
Whitman found out that Clément
was negotiating for the IBBC...

29:04.876 --> 29:07.242
...to purchase a large number
of missile guidance...

29:07.445 --> 29:09.606
...and control systems
from Calvini Defense.

29:09.814 --> 29:12.214
But at the very last minute,
the deal collapsed.

29:12.417 --> 29:13.406
What happened?

29:13.618 --> 29:16.746
We don't know. Whitman's
meeting me in Milan tomorrow.

29:16.955 --> 29:18.889
We're gonna talk to Calvini
and find out.

31:02.260 --> 31:04.057
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:04.996 --> 31:07.294
Eleanor Whitman,
this is Inspector Alberto Cerutti.

31:07.498 --> 31:09.523
- Charmed.
- Nice to meet you.

31:09.734 --> 31:11.099
Please, there's not much time.

31:11.302 --> 31:13.930
Calvini leaves for Turin
immediately after this engagement.

31:14.138 --> 31:16.629
I didn't realize we were meeting
at a political rally.

31:16.841 --> 31:19.435
Best we could do
on such short notice.

31:23.748 --> 31:26.649
Thirtieth floor. I'll be waiting outside.

31:35.360 --> 31:36.725
You need to press the button.

31:43.601 --> 31:45.592
You look awful.

31:45.803 --> 31:47.771
Thanks.

31:49.540 --> 31:51.701
When was the last time
you got any sleep?

31:52.110 --> 31:53.771
Don't know.

31:56.781 --> 31:58.976
When was the last time
you had a healthy meal?

31:59.450 --> 32:01.111
Can't remember.

32:02.553 --> 32:06.489
- How about the last time you got laid?
- Why, are you offering?

32:07.725 --> 32:10.751
You need to take better care
of yourself, Lou.

32:10.962 --> 32:14.762
I can't have you crash and burn
like you did two years ago.

32:17.402 --> 32:19.131
Please follow me.

32:20.071 --> 32:21.902
This meeting is strictly off the record.

32:22.106 --> 32:25.405
Mr. Calvini cannot be entangled
in your investigation...

32:25.610 --> 32:29.569
...nor can his participation in this
discussion find its way to the press.

32:29.781 --> 32:30.770
We understand.

32:31.416 --> 32:33.816
Wait here for a moment.

32:35.586 --> 32:37.850
So you read my file.

32:38.356 --> 32:40.483
I made a few calls to London.

32:40.992 --> 32:42.584
You should've told me everything...

32:42.794 --> 32:46.696
...with your IBBC case at the Yard.
You should've told me it's why you left.

32:47.332 --> 32:49.197
What did they tell you?

32:50.101 --> 32:53.127
That you screwed up because
the witness you brought in was a joke.

32:53.338 --> 32:56.171
And when you were forced to
drop him, the case fell apart.

32:56.374 --> 32:59.707
You flipped out, attacked the assistant
commissioner and broke his nose.

32:59.911 --> 33:03.472
My case did not fall apart, it was shut
down, and my witness was rock-solid.

33:04.248 --> 33:06.614
He gave us everything we needed
against the bank...

33:06.818 --> 33:10.117
...and then suddenly, out of nowhere,
my AC forced me to cut him loose.

33:10.321 --> 33:13.051
Three days later,
they all died in a car crash.

33:15.126 --> 33:17.651
- "They"?
- He had a wife and two kids.

33:20.164 --> 33:23.793
Mr. Calvini, we'd like to know
why the IBBC, a bank...

33:24.002 --> 33:27.267
...would be purchasing millions
of dollars worth of missile guidance...

33:27.472 --> 33:29.303
...and control systems
from your company.

33:32.010 --> 33:35.207
The IBBC has purchased
billions of dollars worth...

33:35.413 --> 33:39.315
...of Silkworm missiles from
the People's Republic of China...

33:39.517 --> 33:42.645
...which they have presold
to clients in the Middle East...

33:42.854 --> 33:44.412
...contingent upon the missiles...

33:44.622 --> 33:47.250
...being equipped
with VOLCON guidance systems.

33:47.859 --> 33:52.262
My company's one of only two in the
world which produce the VOLCON.

33:52.463 --> 33:56.729
- Who's the other?
- Sunay. Ahmet Sunay.

33:56.934 --> 33:58.526
Of Turkish Aerotech?

34:00.204 --> 34:03.105
But why is the bank committing
so much capital and resources...

34:03.307 --> 34:05.502
...to the sale of these missiles?

34:09.847 --> 34:10.835
It's a test.

34:12.949 --> 34:14.713
Small arms
are the only weapons used...

34:14.918 --> 34:18.217
...in 99 percent
of the world's conflicts...

34:18.889 --> 34:21.358
...and no one has the capacity
to manufacture them...

34:21.559 --> 34:24.357
...faster and cheaper than China.

34:24.929 --> 34:27.226
What Skarssen is attempting to do...

34:27.697 --> 34:30.792
...is to make the IBBC
the exclusive broker...

34:31.202 --> 34:34.638
...of Chinese small arms
to the Third World.

34:35.239 --> 34:38.469
And the missile deal
is the gateway transaction.

34:38.876 --> 34:42.607
Yeah, but billions of dollars invested
simply to be a broker?

34:42.813 --> 34:44.475
There can't be much profit for them.

34:44.681 --> 34:48.379
No. This is not about making profit
from weapon sales.

34:50.188 --> 34:52.213
It's about control.

34:53.524 --> 34:57.392
Control the flow of weapons,
control the conflict.

34:57.595 --> 34:58.994
No.

34:59.964 --> 35:02.762
No, no. The IBBC is a bank.

35:03.267 --> 35:06.703
Their objective isn't
to control the conflict...

35:06.904 --> 35:10.271
...it's to control the debt
that the conflict produces.

35:10.842 --> 35:14.243
You see, the real value
of a conflict...

35:14.445 --> 35:15.742
...the true value...

35:16.180 --> 35:18.978
...is in the debt that it creates.

35:19.183 --> 35:21.413
You control the debt...

35:22.253 --> 35:24.346
...you control everything.

35:26.591 --> 35:28.855
You find this upsetting, yes?

35:29.560 --> 35:33.223
But this is the very essence
of the banking industry...

35:33.464 --> 35:38.629
...to make us all,
whether we be nations or individuals...

35:38.836 --> 35:41.134
...slaves to debt.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.802
You sound like
you're not very fond of the IBBC.

35:46.010 --> 35:47.875
What happened?

35:49.514 --> 35:51.607
I was fond of André Clément.

35:52.383 --> 35:54.283
I trusted him...

35:54.485 --> 35:56.146
...and he was a good friend.

36:04.128 --> 36:07.393
Then help us make sure
he didn't die in vain.

36:09.267 --> 36:11.167
Find me after the speech.

36:11.369 --> 36:13.803
We can talk in the car
on my way to the airport.

36:29.053 --> 36:31.453
Umberto Calvini.

38:06.050 --> 38:07.847
Definitely connected to any...

38:20.798 --> 38:22.425
What the hell is going on?

38:22.667 --> 38:24.157
They shot him!

39:24.028 --> 39:26.189
Secure this area
and block all exits, now.

39:26.397 --> 39:27.989
Go!

41:03.727 --> 41:06.093
Oh, my God. Are you all right?

41:06.297 --> 41:07.286
I think so.

41:07.498 --> 41:09.762
Take that left.
Maybe you can cut him off.

41:09.967 --> 41:11.434
Go.

41:12.136 --> 41:13.160
Go!

42:21.705 --> 42:22.694
Turn off the engine...

42:22.907 --> 42:25.273
...and stick your hands
out of the window!

42:26.210 --> 42:27.438
Turn off the engine...

42:27.645 --> 42:30.671
...and stick your hands
out of the window! Now!

42:47.965 --> 42:52.629
Our relationship with the Swiss has
become impossible over the past year.

42:52.836 --> 42:54.770
They are discounting
our dollar deposits...

42:54.972 --> 42:57.338
...by 160 basis points below par.

42:57.541 --> 42:59.805
They have doubled the cost
of moving our money.

43:00.010 --> 43:02.740
Well, general, what do you expect?

43:02.980 --> 43:04.777
You've been in the jungle
long enough...

43:04.982 --> 43:08.008
...to know that when the lion kills,
it's the jackal that profits.

43:08.218 --> 43:09.685
Yes.

43:10.354 --> 43:12.185
The IBBC is specifically structured...

43:12.389 --> 43:15.256
...to handle the particular needs
of your type of organization.

43:15.793 --> 43:18.785
We can give you better rates
and terms than other competitors...

43:19.863 --> 43:21.421
...but we can offer you much more:

43:22.299 --> 43:23.288
Weapons...

43:23.801 --> 43:26.235
...intelligence, logistical support...

43:26.437 --> 43:28.837
...everything that
the Revolutionary Freedom Front...

43:29.039 --> 43:31.030
...would need to revive itself.

43:31.275 --> 43:33.436
But in exchange for what?

43:33.644 --> 43:37.136
You must understand,
the RFF has no money.

43:40.050 --> 43:45.113
Money is not this institution's
primary medium of exchange.

43:48.592 --> 43:51.083
What are you proposing exactly?

43:51.795 --> 43:54.696
We believe that, with the right kind
of direction and support...

43:54.898 --> 43:57.992
...the RFF could become a very
influential force in your country.

43:58.602 --> 43:59.830
Perhaps potent enough...

44:00.037 --> 44:03.234
...to stage a successful coup
in the coming months.

44:05.376 --> 44:07.571
And if this were possible...

44:08.012 --> 44:10.913
...what does your bank
hope to gain from it?

44:13.350 --> 44:18.049
The gratitude and consideration
of a very influential friend.

44:19.757 --> 44:21.486
Excuse me.

44:22.059 --> 44:24.687
Mr. White and Mr. Ehames
asked me to interrupt.

44:26.530 --> 44:29.260
Would you excuse me, general?
I'll be right back.

44:42.446 --> 44:43.743
What is it?

44:49.153 --> 44:52.486
Approximately 30 minutes ago,
Umberto Calvini was assassinated...

44:52.690 --> 44:55.921
...while giving a speech
at a political rally in Milan.

44:59.363 --> 45:00.887
We've been discussing it.

45:01.331 --> 45:04.767
I think we should wait until
the authorities resolve the matter...

45:04.968 --> 45:08.369
...and then approach the sons
to revive negotiations.

45:09.039 --> 45:10.097
How long will this take?

45:10.307 --> 45:14.209
I've been assured the investigation
will move swiftly...

45:15.212 --> 45:19.512
...but unexpected fallout of an event
like this can always complicate things.

45:19.717 --> 45:22.151
We only have 60 days left
to deliver the worms.

45:22.352 --> 45:23.910
There's no time for complications.

45:24.121 --> 45:27.215
That's a risk you take
with such an ambitious agenda.

45:27.858 --> 45:30.827
I don't foresee any problems.
Had it not been for their father...

45:31.028 --> 45:34.020
...Mario and Enzo Calvini
would have made our deal long ago.

45:34.231 --> 45:36.631
Now there's no reason
for them not to move forward.

45:37.835 --> 45:41.066
An important man and devoted father
has just been killed.

45:43.240 --> 45:45.708
I suggest that we send a letter
to Calvini's family...

45:45.909 --> 45:49.868
...extending our heartfelt prayers
and condolences for their terrible loss.

45:51.181 --> 45:52.705
I don't know, but I'm okay.

45:52.916 --> 45:55.282
The doctors
checked me out thoroughly.

45:56.019 --> 45:57.919
Kiss Jake for me, will you?

46:05.395 --> 46:08.592
So the shooter was identified
as a member of the Red Brigade.

46:08.799 --> 46:10.494
What about the guy in the car?

46:10.701 --> 46:13.898
Car was stolen. They were unable
to lift prints, fibers or residue...

46:14.104 --> 46:17.335
...or locate any witnesses
who saw him exiting the vehicle.

46:17.541 --> 46:19.600
- So?
- So the carabinieri are announcing...

46:19.810 --> 46:21.675
...that the Red Brigade
was responsible...

46:21.879 --> 46:24.473
...for the assassination
at the press conference tonight.

46:24.681 --> 46:26.911
We're not convinced
the Red Brigade's behind this.

46:27.117 --> 46:29.847
Someone could simply be
making it appear as though they are.

46:31.188 --> 46:32.587
This isn't my case...

46:32.790 --> 46:35.759
...and the man in charge
of the investigation is very powerful...

46:35.959 --> 46:37.153
...and a real bastard.

46:37.361 --> 46:40.626
All we wanna do
is just look around a little.

47:03.720 --> 47:05.381
- Antonio.
- Alberto.

47:05.923 --> 47:07.220
Just a moment.

47:35.052 --> 47:36.986
They done
the trajectory analysis yet?

47:38.121 --> 47:40.214
Cerutti said no.

49:00.270 --> 49:03.501
If there was a second shooter,
he could've positioned himself here.

49:05.275 --> 49:07.004
The stopwatch they found
in the room...

49:07.210 --> 49:09.235
...it was set on
a one-minute countdown, yes?

49:09.446 --> 49:12.904
Right. Calvini was killed a little
over one minute into his speech.

49:13.717 --> 49:16.151
What if this was all synchronized?

49:19.957 --> 49:21.618
Okay...

49:23.393 --> 49:25.122
...let's say I'm the second shooter.

49:26.596 --> 49:28.291
<i>The guy below</i>
<i>doesn't know I'm here...</i>

49:28.498 --> 49:31.126
<i>... but I'm positioned</i>
<i>right above his room.</i>

49:32.436 --> 49:36.099
<i>I'm armed with a Sauer 200 rifle,</i>
<i>just like he is.</i>

49:37.007 --> 49:39.441
I have a stopwatch set
on a one-minute countdown...

49:39.643 --> 49:42.009
<i>... which I start when Calvini</i>
<i>begins his speech.</i>

49:42.212 --> 49:44.680
The sniper below has been instructed
to do the same...

49:44.881 --> 49:47.543
...because that's when
he's gonna fire his first bullet.

49:47.751 --> 49:52.051
If he misses, I'm ready to
follow through with one of my own.

49:52.889 --> 49:54.948
The sniper fires, misses.

49:55.325 --> 49:56.724
<i>Seconds later...</i>

49:58.028 --> 49:59.791
...I take Calvini out with a headshot.

50:01.465 --> 50:04.093
It's a good theory,
but there's one problem.

50:04.301 --> 50:05.962
Why?

50:08.538 --> 50:11.006
Two shots were fired
from the window...

50:11.208 --> 50:12.971
<i>... two slugs were recovered...</i>

50:13.176 --> 50:15.474
...and two casings were found
next to the gun...

50:15.679 --> 50:19.240
...ballistics confirming that the casings
came from the gun in the hotel room.

50:19.449 --> 50:22.509
<i>So if the kill shot came from</i>
<i>a second shooter here on the roof...</i>

50:22.719 --> 50:25.381
...that'd be a total
of three bullets fired.

50:25.589 --> 50:27.887
How do you explain
the absence of the third bullet?

50:30.527 --> 50:32.290
I can't.

51:00.557 --> 51:02.957
I think I've seen this print before.

51:03.660 --> 51:05.184
Where?

51:05.395 --> 51:07.124
Hanging on the wall of my office.

51:22.612 --> 51:26.378
So this was lifted from the scene of the
Stefan Heuss hit in Brussels last year.

51:26.583 --> 51:28.676
A former IMF executive director.

51:28.885 --> 51:31.115
Has he ever seen
a tread pattern like this before?

51:39.796 --> 51:43.493
He believes it came from
a custom shoe made for a leg brace.

51:43.700 --> 51:45.725
The braces are typically
made out of steel...

51:45.936 --> 51:47.904
...or alloy,
but the condition of the leg...

51:48.105 --> 51:50.471
...would determine the specific
type of device used.

51:52.709 --> 51:54.904
He says that the prints
are a probable match.

51:57.614 --> 52:01.050
Please get these over to Alan Kovacs
at FBI Impressions right away...

52:01.251 --> 52:03.947
...and make sure
he has my contact numbers.

52:04.955 --> 52:06.582
Thanks.

52:07.624 --> 52:10.320
Ella, if the FBI confirms
that these prints are a match...

52:10.527 --> 52:12.927
...it means the bank's
used the same assassin twice.

52:13.897 --> 52:17.799
Which means if we can get him,
we can get the bank.

52:52.369 --> 52:53.631
What was that?

52:58.341 --> 53:01.902
That was <i>Capitano</i> Barillo, the man
in charge of the Calvini investigation.

53:02.112 --> 53:05.309
- What did he want?
- My ass on a platter...

53:05.515 --> 53:07.813
...and both of you
on the next flight out of Milan.

53:08.218 --> 53:10.186
Didn't you tell him
what we just found?

53:10.387 --> 53:11.854
I tried.

53:12.055 --> 53:15.047
Fuck him.
He can't force us to leave.

53:15.258 --> 53:17.852
He has already spoken
to your superiors.

53:18.061 --> 53:20.188
You have both been ordered home.

53:21.097 --> 53:22.894
Arnie, you can't just sit there...

53:23.099 --> 53:25.192
...and lecture me
about protocol and procedure.

53:25.402 --> 53:27.165
You know what's happening here.

53:27.370 --> 53:29.861
Well, who gives a shit
about jurisdictional provenance?

53:30.073 --> 53:32.268
We just had a major breakthrough.

53:33.510 --> 53:36.343
That's great, Arnie.
You're a real stand-up guy.

53:36.546 --> 53:38.673
This is total bullshit.

53:39.282 --> 53:41.182
I wish I could have
been more helpful.

53:41.384 --> 53:43.318
Oh, no, you've been great, Alberto.

53:43.520 --> 53:46.455
I'm gonna do everything I can
to take the heat off you.

53:46.957 --> 53:48.322
Thanks.

53:49.292 --> 53:52.693
Thanks for everything.
Sorry for all the trouble we caused.

54:05.041 --> 54:06.030
What?

54:06.243 --> 54:08.643
His leg brace would be made
of metal, right?

54:09.479 --> 54:12.209
- So?
- So if he left through an airport...

54:12.415 --> 54:14.610
...security would have made him
show it to them.

54:33.870 --> 54:35.462
That's definitely him.

54:35.672 --> 54:39.335
- He doesn't look like much.
- I think that's the idea.

54:40.110 --> 54:41.737
Seems to know
where the cameras are.

54:41.945 --> 54:44.914
Look how he always angles his face
just out of our line of sight.

54:45.115 --> 54:46.514
Even if you do find him...

54:46.716 --> 54:49.913
...that's not enough evidence to
convict the man without a confession.

54:50.120 --> 54:53.351
If we find him, prosecution will be
irrelevant. He'll be a marked man.

54:53.556 --> 54:56.286
He can either die for the bank
or flip for us.

54:57.227 --> 55:01.664
I got him. He is traveling under
the name Sherwood, Timothy M.

55:01.865 --> 55:05.995
He boarded Flight Alitalia 422,
departing Milan at 6 p.m. yesterday...

55:06.202 --> 55:08.636
...and arriving in New York
at JFK at 10 p.m.

55:11.041 --> 55:13.009
What time's the next flight
to New York?

55:53.683 --> 55:57.016
Detectives Hubbard, Ward, Ornelas,
this is Agent Lou Salinger.

55:57.220 --> 55:58.278
- Finally.
- How you doing?

55:58.488 --> 56:01.013
- Let me take that.
- Thanks. So, what do we have?

56:01.224 --> 56:02.350
Well, we got lucky.

56:03.226 --> 56:06.161
Some clip shots of him
moving through customs.

56:06.363 --> 56:08.194
That's a good one.

56:09.699 --> 56:13.658
The Sherwood ID he used? It's clean.
All of it attached to a dead address.

56:13.870 --> 56:15.667
Where'd he go
after he cleared customs?

56:15.872 --> 56:18.705
Don't know.
CCTV footage lost him at the curb.

56:18.908 --> 56:21.900
We canvassed all the limousine
and taxicab companies in the city.

56:22.112 --> 56:26.014
Airport parking, rental agencies.
Didn't come up with shit.

56:26.216 --> 56:28.275
There's a chance
he might live in the city.

56:28.485 --> 56:29.611
Why is that?

56:30.286 --> 56:32.686
Kovacs from FBI Impressions called.

56:33.356 --> 56:37.952
"The footprint was left by a shoe
used for knee-ankle-foot orthosis.

56:38.361 --> 56:41.125
The tread pattern is exclusive
to shoes produced...

56:41.331 --> 56:44.596
...at the Isaacson Orthopedic Institute
here in the city."

56:44.801 --> 56:46.735
The shoe could have only come
from there.

56:46.936 --> 56:49.097
Do you have a contact person
to run down?

56:49.305 --> 56:50.897
We got Dr. Isaacson.

56:52.409 --> 56:55.708
All right. You guys go check it out.
I'm expected at the office.

56:55.912 --> 56:56.901
Hubb?

56:57.113 --> 57:00.241
Get ready for the smackdown.
He's gonna come at you hard.

57:43.827 --> 57:46.489
- Who is it?
- N.Y.P.D.

57:49.299 --> 57:50.891
- Dr. Isaacson?
- Yeah.

57:51.100 --> 57:54.194
Detective Ornelas, N.Y.P.D.
This is my partner, Detective Ward.

57:54.404 --> 57:56.634
- We'd like to ask a couple questions.
- Why?

57:57.006 --> 57:58.564
What do you want?
Why are you here?

57:58.775 --> 58:02.404
Calm down. We just wanna ask you
a few questions about a patient.

58:02.612 --> 58:05.206
Patient? What patient?
Come on, you know what time it is?

58:06.249 --> 58:09.047
Listen, I'm sorry. I must go.
I really didn't do anything.

58:09.252 --> 58:11.618
- I'm sorry. Good night.
- Doctor, if we could...

58:13.923 --> 58:17.518
Douche bag's pinned out of his mind.
He thinks we're here to bust him.

58:20.029 --> 58:21.826
Dr. Isaacson, please.

58:22.031 --> 58:25.296
We have reason to believe your life
is in danger, grave danger.

58:26.369 --> 58:29.236
We think one of your patients
is trying to kill you.

58:34.511 --> 58:35.500
Kill me?

58:35.712 --> 58:39.079
I'm Agent Salinger with Interpol.
We're assisting in this manhunt.

58:39.282 --> 58:42.683
Why would a patient wanna kill me?
I'm an orthopedist.

58:42.886 --> 58:46.185
This man's a psychotic. He's already
butchered seven doctors in Europe.

58:46.389 --> 58:49.222
We got some serious evidence
to suggest you may be next.

58:49.425 --> 58:50.722
Have you ever seen this man?

58:53.096 --> 58:55.860
No, no. I don't think so.

58:56.065 --> 58:59.626
Does the name Timothy Sherwood
mean anything to you, doctor?

58:59.836 --> 59:02.566
No. How do you know
he's a patient of mine?

59:02.772 --> 59:03.830
We have his footprint.

59:04.040 --> 59:06.565
Yeah, the shoe was manufactured
by AGM Biomechanics...

59:06.776 --> 59:11.110
...exclusively for the Isaacson Institute,
model K-A-F-O 1-2-1.

59:11.314 --> 59:13.077
K-A-F-O 1-2-1?

59:13.283 --> 59:15.376
We started prescribing
that three years ago.

59:15.752 --> 59:17.617
We've used it on hundreds
of our patients.

59:17.820 --> 59:20.880
Well, then we're gonna need
to review all of your files.

59:21.491 --> 59:22.583
Right now?

59:22.792 --> 59:26.819
Doctor, we need to find this man
before he finds you.

59:28.464 --> 59:32.093
- What are you trying to do here, Ella?
- I'm doing my job.

59:32.302 --> 59:34.896
You have any idea of the shitstorm
you've gotten me into?

59:35.104 --> 59:37.698
- We're just trying to get to the truth.
- I get it.

59:38.341 --> 59:42.209
You need to remember there's what
people wanna hear, wanna believe...

59:42.412 --> 59:44.846
...there's everything else,
then there's the truth.

59:45.048 --> 59:48.347
And since when is that okay?
I can't believe you're saying this to me.

59:48.551 --> 59:50.610
The truth means responsibility, Arnie.

59:50.820 --> 59:53.789
Exactly, which is why
everyone dreads it.

59:58.895 --> 01:00:00.522
Look...

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:09.199
The IBBC is using one assassin
for all their hits...

01:00:09.639 --> 01:00:12.437
...and we've tracked him here
to New York.

01:00:14.077 --> 01:00:16.739
This guy can bury them.

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:22.945
They want me to put a gun
to your head.

01:00:23.386 --> 01:00:26.150
You don't find this guy,
and I mean quick...

01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:28.586
...they're gonna make me
pull the trigger.

01:00:33.863 --> 01:00:35.797
- Do you want dessert?
- No, thank you.

01:00:36.332 --> 01:00:37.959
I'd like one.

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:40.895
This is a game that rewards
patience and balance.

01:00:41.104 --> 01:00:44.596
You must think like a man of action
and act like a man of thought.

01:00:56.586 --> 01:00:57.814
Gentlemen.

01:00:58.021 --> 01:01:00.785
<i>Sorry to disturb you at home.</i>
<i>I'm afraid this couldn't wait.</i>

01:01:01.557 --> 01:01:02.785
Yes?

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:05.187
<i>Salinger was in Milan.</i>

01:01:05.395 --> 01:01:06.919
<i>Whitman too.</i>

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:08.392
<i>They have the scent.</i>

01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:12.466
<i>It's only a matter of time</i>
<i>before they find our consultant.</i>

01:01:19.542 --> 01:01:21.066
Any recommendations?

01:01:21.277 --> 01:01:23.302
<i>I strongly advise</i>
<i>against doing anything...</i>

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:25.879
<i>... that would heighten your exposure</i>
<i>right now.</i>

01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:28.414
<i>Wilhelm, we've leveraged ourselves</i>
<i>over the edge.</i>

01:01:28.618 --> 01:01:31.553
<i>If we don't meet the delivery date,</i>
<i>buyers will cancel orders...</i>

01:01:31.754 --> 01:01:33.085
<i>... our plans will implode...</i>

01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:35.655
<i>... and this bank will be left</i>
<i>a bill it cannot pay.</i>

01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:38.088
<i>Heightening exposure</i>
<i>is the least of our problems.</i>

01:01:38.294 --> 01:01:40.558
<i>I agree.</i>
<i>We're about to engage Calvini's sons.</i>

01:01:40.763 --> 01:01:42.924
<i>We can't allow anyone</i>
<i>to put our agenda at risk.</i>

01:01:43.132 --> 01:01:45.430
<i>We must sever all ties</i>
<i>with the consultant.</i>

01:01:45.635 --> 01:01:47.796
<i>Consider the mark, gentlemen.</i>

01:01:48.004 --> 01:01:52.941
<i>Doing this could be</i>
<i>a very messy affair.</i>

01:01:53.142 --> 01:01:55.372
<i>Well, then make it one.</i>

01:01:55.578 --> 01:01:58.172
<i>I don't know why you pay me</i>
<i>to advise on these matters.</i>

01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:02.249
<i>It is clear that you don't want my</i>
<i>counsel, only my corroboration.</i>

01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:06.047
<i>Really, Wilhelm. We've had</i>
<i>just about all we can take of you.</i>

01:02:06.255 --> 01:02:11.215
<i>Yes. I've had about all I can take</i>
<i>of myself.</i>

01:02:12.161 --> 01:02:14.459
<i>How would you like us to proceed?</i>

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:22.966
Cassian, what does one do when
there's no way out of a situation?

01:02:23.372 --> 01:02:25.237
If there's no way out...

01:02:26.442 --> 01:02:29.809
...the best thing is
to find a way further in.

01:02:49.732 --> 01:02:52.496
- Fucking disgusting, you know that?
- What are you, my mother?

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:55.603
No, but I could be your old man
for all you know, asshole.

01:03:06.716 --> 01:03:08.274
Hey, doc.

01:03:10.686 --> 01:03:12.085
Gabriel Hansen?

01:03:12.822 --> 01:03:16.383
I don't know.
My associate handled this.

01:03:17.293 --> 01:03:20.023
Well, the address
is a post-office box...

01:03:20.897 --> 01:03:23.422
...and he paid cash
for all of his medical bills.

01:03:24.867 --> 01:03:28.496
There are no diagnostic photos.
Why?

01:03:30.506 --> 01:03:32.269
- I don't know.
- Is there a number?

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:38.243
Yeah, 212-157-6421.

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.109
It's a dead line.

01:03:51.294 --> 01:03:53.524
I'll put a call in to Hubby,
have her run it down.

01:03:53.729 --> 01:03:56.527
See if we can't get a crack warrant
for the P.O. Box in Jersey.

01:04:01.137 --> 01:04:04.629
What do all these GT's
next to the appointment entries mean?

01:04:05.274 --> 01:04:07.902
We have a kickback account
with Go Taxi...

01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:11.175
...and they indicate when we
use their service for a patient.

01:04:13.983 --> 01:04:15.678
<i>Hey. Hubb says you caught a lead.</i>

01:04:15.885 --> 01:04:17.819
Yeah, we've got an address.
We're en route.

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:19.612
- <i>What is it?</i>
- Well, it could be him.

01:04:19.822 --> 01:04:21.050
- <i>Really?</i>
- Yeah.

01:04:21.257 --> 01:04:24.090
<i>Well, they gotta bring him in now.</i>
<i>This is our last shot.</i>

01:04:24.293 --> 01:04:25.851
What do you mean, "our last shot"?

01:04:26.062 --> 01:04:28.929
<i>Arnie and I had it out last night,</i>
<i>and our clock's run out.</i>

01:04:29.465 --> 01:04:33.196
<i>If we don't get this guy right now,</i>
<i>it's over.</i>

01:04:35.004 --> 01:04:37.268
Well, it better be him, then.

01:04:49.218 --> 01:04:51.550
I'm here. Yeah.

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:55.880
I know that.

01:04:56.092 --> 01:04:57.889
This is definitely the right address?

01:04:58.094 --> 01:05:02.087
Checked the log myself. This is where
they dropped him off every time.

01:05:03.332 --> 01:05:05.323
Well, he could be anywhere.

01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:10.933
- What do you think he was doing?
- Beats the shit out of me.

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:12.198
It's a big, empty lot.

01:05:12.408 --> 01:05:15.275
Well, I'm starving. I'm gonna
get something. You want anything?

01:05:15.478 --> 01:05:16.467
Yeah, a coffee, black.

01:05:16.679 --> 01:05:19.045
I'm going back down to
headquarters after this.

01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:21.079
Okay, all right.

01:05:28.724 --> 01:05:29.691
Right, bye.

01:05:29.892 --> 01:05:31.951
How long do you think
this has been like this?

01:05:32.161 --> 01:05:33.992
I don't know, but we need to find out.

01:05:34.196 --> 01:05:36.027
The doctor's records say
the last time...

01:05:36.232 --> 01:05:39.099
...somebody got dropped off here
was five weeks ago.

01:05:39.702 --> 01:05:42.569
I mean, there's not even
a temporary office or anything.

01:05:43.239 --> 01:05:45.230
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

01:06:02.058 --> 01:06:04.754
Son of a bitch.

01:06:10.232 --> 01:06:11.256
What's the matter?

01:06:11.467 --> 01:06:14.129
I just made our perp.
Eleven o'clock, blue overcoat.

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:19.366
- You sure that's him?
- A hundred percent.

01:06:20.042 --> 01:06:21.873
- Where did he come from?
- Shit if I know.

01:06:22.078 --> 01:06:24.808
I'm at the counter and
I see him rolling past the window.

01:06:25.014 --> 01:06:26.379
- Wanna go for the collar?
- No.

01:06:26.582 --> 01:06:29.210
We tail him, find out where he sleeps,
then take him down.

01:06:29.418 --> 01:06:32.353
A, B, C. Keep the box tight.

01:07:50.399 --> 01:07:55.166
- <i>Five-oh-two-six. Designator?</i>
- Samuel Koppler.

01:07:56.972 --> 01:07:58.200
<i>Message:</i>

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:01.775
<i>Your uncle</i>
<i>wishes to see you immediately.</i>

01:08:01.977 --> 01:08:03.376
<i>Response?</i>

01:08:03.579 --> 01:08:08.312
The Guggenheim, fifth floor
of the rotunda, 40 minutes.

01:08:53.962 --> 01:08:55.487
- Hi, how you doing?
- Hello.

01:08:55.698 --> 01:08:57.928
N.Y.P.D. I need to
speak to your security chief.

01:08:58.134 --> 01:08:59.533
Okay, one moment.

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:02.194
Rick?

01:09:02.837 --> 01:09:06.171
How you doing? Detective Ornelas.
I need to be able to clear security.

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:07.808
- Okay.
- Thanks.

01:09:13.015 --> 01:09:14.676
We're clear.

01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:48.514
Directly behind me.

01:09:56.325 --> 01:09:58.156
There you go. Thank you.

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:51.205
Who's the old scag
sitting next to him?

01:10:51.413 --> 01:10:54.610
I don't know, but I saw him at the
bank's headquarters in Luxembourg.

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:57.913
You don't look well today.

01:10:58.354 --> 01:11:00.822
We all begin better than we end.

01:11:01.624 --> 01:11:03.956
What would you prefer your ending
to be like?

01:11:04.159 --> 01:11:09.096
Oh, more purposeful,
and certainly more climactic.

01:11:09.598 --> 01:11:11.190
A finale.

01:11:11.834 --> 01:11:13.426
A finale.

01:11:13.636 --> 01:11:17.163
Circumstances can always
be arranged.

01:11:18.173 --> 01:11:20.038
As much as the thought
appeals to me...

01:11:20.242 --> 01:11:23.905
...l'm afraid your consideration
is needed elsewhere.

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:27.305
- What is this?
- Salinger.

01:11:27.883 --> 01:11:30.716
The method and manner
is entirely up to you.

01:11:30.919 --> 01:11:36.118
Your principle would simply like him
to vanish without a trace.

01:11:38.394 --> 01:11:41.693
- Any other provisions?
- Yes.

01:11:41.897 --> 01:11:43.194
No mistakes.

01:11:46.535 --> 01:11:48.332
I'll follow.

01:11:53.542 --> 01:11:56.841
- Where's Iggy going?
- Following a new lead.

01:12:25.641 --> 01:12:27.006
Shit.

01:12:27.209 --> 01:12:28.574
We gotta go.

01:12:30.212 --> 01:12:33.306
N.Y.P.D. Lock your hands
behind your head.

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:38.479
Do it now.

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:40.817
They'll never let you bring me in.

01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:43.082
Do it, or I'll take you down.

01:12:46.295 --> 01:12:47.557
- Cuffs.
- On the belt.

01:12:58.073 --> 01:12:59.438
There's a guy right up there.

01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:29.262
- Where'd he...?
- Up there! Up there!

01:13:39.948 --> 01:13:40.937
Get down!

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:49.621
- God! Oh, my God!
- It's okay.

01:13:52.394 --> 01:13:53.383
Down there.

01:14:03.238 --> 01:14:05.069
Shit.

01:14:25.327 --> 01:14:26.316
Drop the gun.

01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:31.360
- If I drop the gun, we'll both die.
- I said, drop the gun!

01:14:31.567 --> 01:14:35.526
They're here for me but they'll kill
you too. Now help me get this off.

01:14:37.072 --> 01:14:38.266
I can't breathe.

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:02.959
Stairs.

01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:16.910
- Fuck.
- You okay?

01:15:20.048 --> 01:15:21.515
The ramp is the only way out.

01:17:36.785 --> 01:17:38.412
Hey.

01:17:40.088 --> 01:17:42.648
Don't you fucking dare.

01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:37.906
<i>I'm calling from the dark side.</i>

01:18:38.113 --> 01:18:41.776
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
- <i>I'm calling from the...</i>

01:19:19.621 --> 01:19:20.918
Get back.

01:19:41.343 --> 01:19:43.004
I told you.

01:19:45.046 --> 01:19:47.412
What? You told me what?

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:51.851
They'd never let you bring me in.

01:20:18.013 --> 01:20:19.002
Fuck, fuck.

01:20:29.124 --> 01:20:31.388
<i>Move away from the building.</i>

01:20:31.593 --> 01:20:35.461
<i>Can everybody please</i>
<i>move away from the building?</i>

01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:56.017
They know you're coming.
We gotta hurry.

01:20:56.218 --> 01:20:59.551
- Where'd they find him?
- Sitting on a bench near the reservoir.

01:21:00.188 --> 01:21:03.316
- Has he said anything yet?
- Nothing. He's pretty shaken up.

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:07.325
- Who else knows he's here?
- Everyone. Nothing I could do.

01:21:07.529 --> 01:21:09.929
Heavies from the Bureau
and Justice are on their way.

01:21:10.131 --> 01:21:11.826
- <i>with an unidentified third man.</i>

01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:14.763
- How long do I have?
- Five, 10 minutes, max.

01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:17.495
- <i>wanted for questioning</i>
<i>in an ongoing investigation.</i>

01:21:17.806 --> 01:21:23.108
<i>Now, a Guggenheim employee tells me</i>
<i>that while they were in the museum...</i>

01:21:59.314 --> 01:22:01.509
This isn't over.

01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:21.228
Are you sure about this?

01:22:27.142 --> 01:22:28.131
Just read it.

01:22:43.591 --> 01:22:45.582
- They recognize you?
- Don't think so.

01:22:50.065 --> 01:22:52.033
Back it up!

01:23:33.541 --> 01:23:35.668
- <i>... screens came crashing down.</i>
- How you doing?

01:23:35.877 --> 01:23:39.210
- <i>There was glass everywhere.</i>
- As compared to what?

01:23:39.414 --> 01:23:41.245
<i>And just on the ground.</i>

01:23:41.449 --> 01:23:44.179
<i>When you heard all of this</i>
<i>commotion, did you think...?</i>

01:23:44.419 --> 01:23:46.353
Anything you need, Ellie,
just let me know.

01:23:46.554 --> 01:23:48.579
- Thanks.
- <i>I just heard gunshots.</i>

01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:50.917
<i>And people were hit</i>
<i>and screaming...</i>

01:23:51.126 --> 01:23:53.356
<i>... and people just started running</i>
<i>out the door...</i>

01:23:53.561 --> 01:23:55.290
<i>... and I didn't know</i>
<i>what was going on.</i>

01:23:55.497 --> 01:23:56.486
You okay?

01:23:57.265 --> 01:23:58.789
Yeah.

01:24:00.668 --> 01:24:02.761
You flip this guy.

01:24:03.238 --> 01:24:06.173
You make sure my partner
wasn't killed for nothing.

01:24:06.374 --> 01:24:10.105
<i>I know that... I think random people</i>
<i>were going down and...</i>

01:24:10.311 --> 01:24:14.839
<i>I mean, there was police running up</i>
<i>as other people were going down.</i>

01:24:27.362 --> 01:24:28.886
You ready for this?

01:25:05.567 --> 01:25:08.058
Good evening, Colonel Wexler.

01:25:09.871 --> 01:25:12.499
I'm Agent Louis Salinger.

01:25:13.308 --> 01:25:15.469
I know who you are.

01:25:17.345 --> 01:25:19.438
Of course you do.

01:25:21.483 --> 01:25:23.815
I was at the Guggenheim
this afternoon.

01:25:26.054 --> 01:25:27.646
<i>The assassin you met with...</i>

01:25:29.324 --> 01:25:31.417
<i>... I know you were his handler.</i>

01:25:31.626 --> 01:25:34.789
I know you arranged for him
to be killed at the behest of the bank...

01:25:34.996 --> 01:25:37.191
...because I was obviously
getting too close.

01:25:40.502 --> 01:25:43.198
But if a hit team at the Guggenheim
is what happens...

01:25:43.404 --> 01:25:46.202
...because I was
getting too close to him...

01:25:48.776 --> 01:25:52.473
...what do you think the bank'll do
when it realizes how close I am to you?

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:57.242
Death comes for us all,
Agent Salinger.

01:25:57.986 --> 01:26:00.045
But based on everything
I've read about you...

01:26:00.255 --> 01:26:01.950
...you seem like the kind of man...

01:26:02.157 --> 01:26:05.058
...who aspired to die
for something more than this.

01:26:06.861 --> 01:26:11.355
Well, this is the difference
between truth and fiction.

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:14.964
Fiction has to make sense.

01:26:17.739 --> 01:26:19.639
I'm confused, colonel.

01:26:22.810 --> 01:26:25.005
Why would a tried
and true communist...

01:26:26.114 --> 01:26:28.480
...a hardliner that spent 30 years
in the Stasi...

01:26:28.683 --> 01:26:30.844
...fighting against the evils
of capitalism...

01:26:31.553 --> 01:26:34.716
Why would this man waste his
final days working for an institution...

01:26:34.923 --> 01:26:38.086
...that was the very embodiment
of everything he once despised?

01:26:41.129 --> 01:26:43.996
You dedicated your life
to the communist ideal.

01:26:46.434 --> 01:26:49.801
You sacrificed everything
for the good of the party.

01:26:51.339 --> 01:26:52.670
For what?

01:26:56.411 --> 01:26:59.039
You lost your wife to betrayal...

01:26:59.681 --> 01:27:02.172
...your daughter to suicide...

01:27:03.551 --> 01:27:06.782
...and when the Wall fell,
your whole life fell apart with it.

01:27:07.088 --> 01:27:09.352
You know nothing about me.

01:27:09.924 --> 01:27:12.791
I was lost long before the Wall fell.

01:27:14.028 --> 01:27:18.727
I was once destined to become
a man much like yourself.

01:27:19.167 --> 01:27:20.964
True-hearted...

01:27:21.302 --> 01:27:23.270
...determined...

01:27:23.471 --> 01:27:25.439
...full of purpose.

01:27:26.441 --> 01:27:28.341
But...

01:27:28.810 --> 01:27:31.540
...character is easier kept
than recovered.

01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:36.648
We cannot control
the things life does to us.

01:27:37.318 --> 01:27:41.254
They are done before you know it,
and once they are done...

01:27:42.657 --> 01:27:44.818
...they make you do other things...

01:27:45.426 --> 01:27:48.623
...until at last,
everything comes between you...

01:27:49.664 --> 01:27:52.155
...and the man you wanted to be.

01:27:54.102 --> 01:27:55.569
No.

01:27:57.505 --> 01:28:00.668
We all have choices in life.
You made yours.

01:28:08.082 --> 01:28:09.879
Sometimes a man
can meet his destiny...

01:28:10.084 --> 01:28:11.915
...on the road he took to avoid it.

01:28:15.156 --> 01:28:17.886
Skarssen and that bank need to
answer for what they've done.

01:28:18.092 --> 01:28:20.060
They have to be brought to justice.

01:28:20.261 --> 01:28:22.195
You can help me do that.

01:28:22.530 --> 01:28:24.327
Justice...

01:28:25.166 --> 01:28:27.100
...is not possible.

01:28:27.769 --> 01:28:29.236
Why not?

01:28:29.704 --> 01:28:32.195
Because, Agent Salinger...

01:28:32.407 --> 01:28:36.343
...your idea of justice is an illusion.

01:28:37.111 --> 01:28:39.636
<i>Understand the very system</i>
<i>that you serve and protect...</i>

01:28:39.847 --> 01:28:43.374
<i>... will never allow anything to happen</i>
<i>to Skarssen or the bank.</i>

01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:45.543
On the contrary.

01:28:45.953 --> 01:28:50.014
The system guarantees
the IBBC's safety...

01:28:50.458 --> 01:28:53.689
...because everyone is involved.

01:28:54.495 --> 01:28:56.429
What do you mean, "everyone"?

01:28:59.267 --> 01:29:00.700
Hezbollah.

01:29:01.235 --> 01:29:03.169
CIA.

01:29:03.671 --> 01:29:05.366
The Columbian drug cartels.

01:29:05.773 --> 01:29:07.934
Russian organized crime.

01:29:08.142 --> 01:29:11.578
Governments of Iran, Germany,
China, your government.

01:29:11.813 --> 01:29:14.873
Every multinational corporation,
every one.

01:29:15.316 --> 01:29:19.616
They all need banks like the IBBC...

01:29:19.821 --> 01:29:24.690
...so that they can operate
within the black and gray latitudes.

01:29:25.093 --> 01:29:27.118
And this is why
your investigative efforts...

01:29:27.328 --> 01:29:30.889
...have either been ignored
or undermined...

01:29:31.099 --> 01:29:34.227
...and why you and I
will be quietly disposed of...

01:29:35.236 --> 01:29:40.264
...before any case against the bank
ever reaches a court of law.

01:29:46.414 --> 01:29:48.439
<i>So, what are we all</i>
<i>supposed to do?</i>

01:29:51.786 --> 01:29:54.050
We just supposed to give up...

01:29:54.355 --> 01:29:57.119
...and accept that
this is the way of the world?

01:30:01.596 --> 01:30:03.359
I'm not gonna do that.

01:30:04.799 --> 01:30:07.962
I still believe... I know...

01:30:08.169 --> 01:30:11.570
...that there has to be a way
to bring down this bank...

01:30:12.206 --> 01:30:14.572
...and you are gonna help me.

01:30:21.716 --> 01:30:23.877
You understand...

01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:28.984
...if you really want to
stop the IBBC...

01:30:29.724 --> 01:30:34.889
...you won't be able to do it within the
boundaries of your system of justice.

01:30:35.530 --> 01:30:37.896
You will have to go outside.

01:30:38.666 --> 01:30:40.224
Once you do...

01:30:41.903 --> 01:30:45.395
...there will always be
collateral damage.

01:30:50.144 --> 01:30:51.873
<i>Yes.</i>

01:30:52.947 --> 01:30:57.350
<i>Should you sacrifice your own ideals</i>
<i>for the greater good?</i>

01:30:58.519 --> 01:31:02.319
That's a difficult choice,
one I understand all too well...

01:31:03.257 --> 01:31:05.487
...but as you so eloquently put it...

01:31:05.927 --> 01:31:09.260
...sometimes a man
can meet his destiny...

01:31:09.464 --> 01:31:12.865
...on the road he took to avoid it.

01:31:24.779 --> 01:31:25.871
What?

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:27.308
What are you doing?

01:31:27.949 --> 01:31:29.849
I think it's time for you to leave.

01:31:30.518 --> 01:31:35.217
- Leave? What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about.

01:31:38.759 --> 01:31:40.590
No way, Lou.

01:31:40.795 --> 01:31:43.662
No fucking way.
You've already got him turned.

01:31:43.865 --> 01:31:47.266
Now go back in there
and get him to come in on his own.

01:31:47.802 --> 01:31:50.828
We can use everything.
We'll blow this whole thing wide open.

01:31:51.038 --> 01:31:53.336
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

01:31:53.541 --> 01:31:55.532
I'm not gonna make
the same mistake twice.

01:31:55.743 --> 01:31:59.304
- I can protect him, Lou.
- No, you can't. They'll get to him.

01:31:59.514 --> 01:32:01.072
If they can't, they'll get to you.

01:32:01.282 --> 01:32:03.682
If they can't get to you,
they'll get to your family.

01:32:16.397 --> 01:32:18.558
I can't just walk away from this.

01:32:19.867 --> 01:32:22.665
You're walking away
so I don't have to.

01:32:31.612 --> 01:32:33.045
How can you trust him?

01:32:33.514 --> 01:32:36.642
That relic in there
is looking for redemption.

01:32:36.851 --> 01:32:38.876
I'm the only one
who can give it to him.

01:32:39.954 --> 01:32:42.787
Then who gives it to you
when this is all over?

01:32:44.492 --> 01:32:46.551
You need to cut me loose.

01:32:49.163 --> 01:32:51.893
Tell them I escaped from custody,
whatever you have to.

01:32:52.099 --> 01:32:54.090
Just use my history.
They'll believe you.

01:32:54.302 --> 01:32:56.566
- I don't know.
- Ella, listen to me.

01:32:58.439 --> 01:32:59.804
Sometimes the hardest thing...

01:33:00.007 --> 01:33:02.999
...is to know which bridge to cross
and which to burn.

01:33:07.415 --> 01:33:09.610
I'm the one you burn.

01:34:09.210 --> 01:34:11.269
We've been waiting here
for an hour.

01:34:11.479 --> 01:34:15.279
I'm sorry, Martin, but none of us
have been able to reach them.

01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:20.344
Unfortunately, Mario and Enzo Calvini
are not known for their punctuality.

01:34:20.554 --> 01:34:22.385
They do realize this is the closing?

01:34:45.179 --> 01:34:46.510
Mr. White...

01:34:46.714 --> 01:34:50.172
...l've been instructed to escort you
and your associates from the building.

01:34:50.384 --> 01:34:52.443
Please gather your materials
and come with me.

01:34:52.653 --> 01:34:56.180
- Instructed by whom?
- Please, if you could just comply.

01:35:18.412 --> 01:35:21.040
Our father
never trusted these people.

01:35:22.683 --> 01:35:25.811
Thank you for telling us the truth.

01:35:29.423 --> 01:35:31.254
Had you not come forward...

01:35:31.459 --> 01:35:33.859
...we would have made
a terrible mistake today.

01:35:34.061 --> 01:35:36.723
I'm just glad I could be of service.

01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:46.733
I don't know, Jonas. I was told nothing.
I was simply thrown out.

01:35:47.208 --> 01:35:48.971
<i>They know.</i>

01:35:55.449 --> 01:35:59.749
Look, I can't discuss this right now.
I'll call you when I'm in the air.

01:36:25.346 --> 01:36:27.837
<i>Welcome to World News.</i>
<i>I'm Tristana Moore.</i>

01:36:28.048 --> 01:36:31.449
<i>We're live today in the</i>
<i>Democratic Republic of Niberia.</i>

01:36:31.652 --> 01:36:34.678
<i>As we go on air, we're getting reports</i>
<i>that thousands of troops...</i>

01:36:34.889 --> 01:36:38.518
<i>... loyal to General Charles Motomba's</i>
<i>Revolutionary Freedom Front...</i>

01:36:38.726 --> 01:36:41.286
<i>... are moving towards</i>
<i>the capital of Dénué.</i>

01:36:41.495 --> 01:36:44.430
<i>According to eyewitnesses,</i>
<i>several explosions have been heard...</i>

01:36:44.632 --> 01:36:48.625
<i>... and there've been heavy outbreaks</i>
<i>of gunfire in many parts of the city.</i>

01:36:48.836 --> 01:36:51.498
<i>The people of Niberia</i>
<i>have suffered greatly.</i>

01:36:51.705 --> 01:36:55.141
<i>It is time to begin a new chapter</i>
<i>in our country's history.</i>

01:36:55.342 --> 01:36:58.209
<i>We will not stop</i>
<i>until national liberation...</i>

01:36:58.412 --> 01:37:00.880
<i>... and the restoration of nationhood...</i>

01:37:05.686 --> 01:37:06.710
News about Martin?

01:37:07.688 --> 01:37:10.179
He didn't show up at his hotel
or at the airport.

01:37:10.391 --> 01:37:14.953
The Italian police have been unable
to locate his car or driver.

01:37:15.162 --> 01:37:18.825
I think Enzo and Mario Calvini
are sending us a message.

01:37:19.033 --> 01:37:21.399
How could they possibly
have found out?

01:37:25.172 --> 01:37:27.697
This is precisely
what we pay you to know.

01:37:27.908 --> 01:37:29.398
We're out of time and options.

01:37:29.810 --> 01:37:33.712
- We must make the deal with Sunay.
- How can we trust this man?

01:37:33.914 --> 01:37:37.042
The Israeli government
is his biggest customer.

01:37:37.251 --> 01:37:38.343
Why would he agree...

01:37:38.552 --> 01:37:42.113
...to help us provide missiles
to the Iranians and the Syrians...

01:37:42.323 --> 01:37:45.053
...that have a first-strike capability
against the Israelis?

01:37:45.259 --> 01:37:47.727
I know Sunay.
I believe he has every intention...

01:37:47.928 --> 01:37:49.759
...of selling you
the guidance systems...

01:37:50.197 --> 01:37:52.358
...because he's already provided
the Israelis...

01:37:52.566 --> 01:37:55.399
...with the countermeasures
to defeat them.

01:37:57.304 --> 01:38:00.102
Would the Turk really play
such a dangerous game?

01:38:01.609 --> 01:38:03.236
We are.

01:38:04.378 --> 01:38:06.642
The only way we can make this work...

01:38:06.847 --> 01:38:07.836
...is to guarantee...

01:38:08.048 --> 01:38:10.778
...that Sunay keeps this information
in complete confidence.

01:38:10.985 --> 01:38:14.921
If our buyers find out the missiles are
worthless, they'll pull all their orders...

01:38:15.122 --> 01:38:17.454
...and this bank will be left insolvent.

01:38:17.958 --> 01:38:19.892
Have him here
by tomorrow afternoon.

01:38:20.094 --> 01:38:23.325
Tomorrow he's going to
a funeral service for his cousin.

01:38:23.530 --> 01:38:25.395
He'll be unavailable till Monday.

01:38:26.033 --> 01:38:29.127
Unless of course,
you'd be willing to attend.

01:38:30.604 --> 01:38:32.401
Make the call.

01:38:34.875 --> 01:38:37.173
Get me Ahmet Sunay.

01:38:43.984 --> 01:38:45.952
It's tomorrow.

01:39:27.161 --> 01:39:29.721
It's right there.
Do you want to be escorted?

01:39:29.930 --> 01:39:31.363
We'll be fine, thank you.

01:39:37.338 --> 01:39:38.771
The Sunay funeral, please.

01:39:38.973 --> 01:39:41.271
It will be over soon.
You may wait here.

01:39:41.475 --> 01:39:45.468
- Is there a bathroom I could use?
- Just over there.

01:39:45.679 --> 01:39:48.614
- I won't be a moment.
- Right.

01:39:55.122 --> 01:39:57.283
- The signal?
- Good.

01:39:57.491 --> 01:39:58.856
<i>The Sunay funeral, please.</i>

01:39:59.493 --> 01:40:03.020
- Where'd you put the spike?
- Inside the lapel of his jacket.

01:40:04.231 --> 01:40:05.289
The lawyer?

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:08.058
White?

01:40:08.302 --> 01:40:09.326
He's gone.

01:40:11.071 --> 01:40:14.939
I told you, there will always
be collateral damage...

01:40:15.142 --> 01:40:17.406
...when you take matters
into your own hands.

01:40:19.847 --> 01:40:20.871
Your plan is working.

01:40:21.815 --> 01:40:24.045
It has left Skarssen
with only one option.

01:40:24.251 --> 01:40:27.948
Record the conversation
and you'll gain your end.

01:40:30.124 --> 01:40:33.651
Sure they'll talk about Sunay's deal
with Israel and the countermeasures?

01:40:33.861 --> 01:40:35.192
It is the key issue.

01:40:35.396 --> 01:40:37.330
Once you let the Iranians
and Syrians...

01:40:37.531 --> 01:40:42.093
...hear that the missiles are completely
useless against the Israelis...

01:40:42.603 --> 01:40:48.439
...they will cancel their orders
and the IBBC will collapse.

01:40:57.117 --> 01:40:59.210
- Wilhelm.
- Ahmet.

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:01.017
It's been a long time.

01:41:01.388 --> 01:41:02.377
<i>Yes.</i>

01:41:02.589 --> 01:41:04.454
<i>My sympathies for the loss</i>
<i>of your cousin.</i>

01:41:04.658 --> 01:41:05.886
Thank you.

01:41:06.093 --> 01:41:08.687
Jonas Skarssen, Ahmet Sunay.

01:41:08.896 --> 01:41:13.060
If you'd simply come to me in the
beginning, it would have been better.

01:41:15.903 --> 01:41:17.700
<i>Midday prayers will begin soon.</i>

01:41:17.905 --> 01:41:20.430
Should take a short time
to settle on the broad strokes.

01:41:20.641 --> 01:41:22.506
<i>The rest can be sorted out</i>
<i>at your leisure.</i>

01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:23.698
<i>We have 10 minutes.</i>

01:41:35.823 --> 01:41:39.156
Wilhelm, would you mind
if I spoke to Mr. Sunay alone?

01:41:44.398 --> 01:41:48.027
I believe I understand
the particulars of your situation.

01:41:48.235 --> 01:41:51.068
<i>Perhaps we should discuss this</i>
<i>in a more private place.</i>

01:41:51.271 --> 01:41:52.932
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:55.968
<i>Allow me to show you something</i>
<i>very special.</i>

01:41:56.176 --> 01:41:59.942
<i>Something that very few outsiders</i>
<i>know exists.</i>

01:42:01.448 --> 01:42:06.147
<i>It's my understanding that the product</i>
<i>you purchased are the XW-41 s.</i>

01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:07.644
After you.

01:42:07.855 --> 01:42:10.187
<i>Yes. Forty-two hundred units.</i>

01:42:12.459 --> 01:42:15.292
What kind of guidance
are they currently equipped...?

01:42:20.534 --> 01:42:23.526
<i>They all need to be upgraded</i>
<i>with VOLCON systems.</i>

01:42:24.338 --> 01:42:25.999
<i>Launch platforms?</i>

01:42:26.206 --> 01:42:28.766
<i>Ground-based vehicles</i>
<i>and fixed-wing aircraft.</i>

01:42:39.219 --> 01:42:41.779
So you understand
I have a terminal deadline.

01:42:41.989 --> 01:42:43.786
First of February, yes.

01:42:43.991 --> 01:42:45.891
- <i>Can you meet it?</i>
- <i>To be sure.</i>

01:42:46.093 --> 01:42:49.688
<i>But you must arrange for the</i>
<i>end-user certificates, transport...</i>

01:42:49.897 --> 01:42:51.421
<i>We'll arrange for it all.</i>

01:42:51.632 --> 01:42:53.065
<i>Where would the work be done?</i>

01:42:53.267 --> 01:42:56.134
<i>Cyprus. I've a facility there.</i>

01:42:57.571 --> 01:43:01.132
<i>We would start retrofitting the worms</i>
<i>within a day of their arrival.</i>

01:43:01.341 --> 01:43:04.401
<i>So if you deliver them to me</i>
<i>within the next two weeks...</i>

01:43:04.611 --> 01:43:06.545
<i>... we'll meet your deadline.</i>

01:43:19.126 --> 01:43:22.391
I'm concerned that we limit any and all
knowledge of your involvement.

01:43:23.096 --> 01:43:26.497
<i>If we structure my involvement</i>
<i>through a thick veil of shells...</i>

01:43:27.701 --> 01:43:29.669
<i>... I don't foresee any complications.</i>

01:43:31.104 --> 01:43:33.834
- Sorry?
- You. Come here now.

01:43:34.041 --> 01:43:37.067
<i>Usually we would involve</i>
<i>our import partners from Russia.</i>

01:43:37.511 --> 01:43:38.944
What? I'm just a tourist.

01:43:39.146 --> 01:43:41.740
- Now, you must leave.
- Could you get that light out of...?

01:43:41.949 --> 01:43:44.577
Get your fucking...

01:43:46.753 --> 01:43:50.245
So, shall we discuss numbers?

01:43:50.691 --> 01:43:52.386
There is a more salient deal point...

01:43:52.593 --> 01:43:55.391
...that needs to be resolved
before we can do that.

01:43:55.596 --> 01:43:57.393
<i>And what point is that?</i>

01:43:58.398 --> 01:44:00.628
<i>The point of fidelity.</i>

01:44:07.808 --> 01:44:09.833
I know you provided
the Israeli government...

01:44:10.043 --> 01:44:12.978
...with the countermeasures
to this guidance system.

01:44:21.088 --> 01:44:23.147
Last year alone...

01:44:23.357 --> 01:44:26.918
...I did more than 300 million
in business with the Israelis.

01:44:30.631 --> 01:44:32.929
I would never put that at risk.

01:44:33.133 --> 01:44:37.331
How can I trust you not to divulge
this information to anyone else?

01:44:38.305 --> 01:44:40.830
It's mutual interest, not trust...

01:44:41.275 --> 01:44:43.903
...that will be the bond
of our relationship.

01:44:47.681 --> 01:44:50.514
Your compensation will be held
in an escrow account.

01:44:51.752 --> 01:44:53.947
- <i>released until our clients pay</i>
<i>in full.</i>

01:44:54.655 --> 01:44:55.986
And those are the terms.

01:44:58.759 --> 01:45:00.386
<i>The payout structure...</i>

01:45:02.796 --> 01:45:05.094
<i>The transfers will be begun</i>
<i>by tomorrow morning.</i>

01:45:05.299 --> 01:45:08.791
<i>Ehames will contact you with</i>
<i>the number for the escrow account.</i>

01:45:14.107 --> 01:45:17.099
So ends the bloody business
of the day.

01:45:29.956 --> 01:45:32.322
We're closed. I need you and Ehames
here tomorrow...

01:45:32.526 --> 01:45:35.086
...to work out all the details
with Sunay's people.

01:45:35.495 --> 01:45:38.225
Yes. We're on our way home.

01:45:46.073 --> 01:45:47.062
Wilhelm?

01:45:50.077 --> 01:45:51.476
Wake up.

01:48:52.526 --> 01:48:53.515
Who are you?

01:48:55.762 --> 01:48:57.525
I'm Louis Salinger.

01:49:07.507 --> 01:49:10.203
You don't have the authority
to arrest me.

01:49:12.479 --> 01:49:15.175
Who said anything
about arresting you?

01:49:19.519 --> 01:49:23.250
- What do you want?
- I want some fucking justice.

01:49:23.456 --> 01:49:27.153
Wait, wait. Wait.
Executing me won't change anything.

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:29.851
There will be 100 other bankers
to take my place.

01:49:30.063 --> 01:49:33.055
Everything will continue.

01:49:33.266 --> 01:49:39.205
The only thing you'll succeed in doing
is to satisfy your own blood lust.

01:49:44.144 --> 01:49:45.577
And you know it.

01:50:40.233 --> 01:50:42.861
With compliments of Enzo
and Mario Calvini.

01:50:58.018 --> 01:50:59.485
Thank you.

01:53:59.486 --> 01:54:00.486
