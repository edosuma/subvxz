18:21.293 --> 18:23.327
Yeah.

18:28.016 --> 18:30.383
I understand that you
gave Ellie a narcotic.

18:30.408 --> 18:31.907
The numbing spray wouldn't work.

18:31.932 --> 18:34.657
Sedating her was the only way
we could perform the endoscopy.

18:34.682 --> 18:36.537
Was it worth it?

18:37.065 --> 18:39.445
The endoscopy was inconclusive.

18:39.470 --> 18:40.338
Mm-hmm.

18:40.372 --> 18:42.961
I thought that we concluded
that staying away from narcotics

18:42.986 --> 18:44.187
was this Ellie's top priority.

18:44.212 --> 18:45.556
Yes, but she's a minor.

18:45.566 --> 18:47.898
She wasn't in any condition
to make decisions.

18:47.923 --> 18:49.617
And what condition was
her father in, hmm?

18:49.702 --> 18:52.259
Was he sober when you asked his consent?

18:52.284 --> 18:54.312
She was in so much pain.

18:54.337 --> 18:56.468
It was the right call to make.

18:57.618 --> 18:59.171
I think it might have
felt like the right call

For Ellie, gonna have to wait and see.

19:09.916 --> 19:12.939
Our clients are people who are
desperate to have children.

19:12.964 --> 19:15.773
Ms. Desai is helping a
couple realize that dream.

19:15.798 --> 19:17.262
But her life is in jeopardy.

19:17.287 --> 19:20.145
We... we'd like to
understand the arrangement

19:20.170 --> 19:22.233
your clients have with our patient.

19:22.258 --> 19:25.059
Well, she has graciously
allowed our clients' baby

19:25.084 --> 19:26.642
to develop in her womb.

19:26.667 --> 19:28.470
In turn, they give her a living stipend

19:28.495 --> 19:30.789
for every week she nurtures that child.

19:30.814 --> 19:32.929
She specifically said
she needs the payout.

19:32.954 --> 19:33.681
What's that?

19:33.706 --> 19:35.777
In the spirit of
inspiring a healthy baby,

19:35.802 --> 19:37.916
our clients have promised a bonus

19:37.941 --> 19:39.665
should Ms. Desai carry to term.

19:39.690 --> 19:41.156
That's what she's killing herself for.

19:41.177 --> 19:46.345
Ms. Allen, this contract seems
to be incentivizing our patient

19:46.370 --> 19:50.351
to put her health at risk. Is
there any way to alter this?

19:50.376 --> 19:51.173
How so?

19:51.198 --> 19:54.159
Well, perhaps she would
deliver the baby now

19:54.184 --> 19:55.908
if she knew she was still eligible

19:55.933 --> 19:58.033
for at least a part of that bonus.

19:58.058 --> 20:00.439
Unfortunately, our
clients have stipulated

20:00.464 --> 20:02.960
that they do not wish to
adopt a premature baby.

20:02.985 --> 20:04.103
It's their baby.

20:04.128 --> 20:05.625
According to the law, my clients are

20:05.650 --> 20:08.040
under no obligation to adopt this child.

20:08.227 --> 20:09.694
Wait.

20:09.884 --> 20:13.439
Then who's responsible for this baby?

20:13.699 --> 20:16.266
If the bio parents choose not to adopt,

20:16.291 --> 20:18.500
Ms. Desai is welcome to keep the child

20:18.525 --> 20:19.696
or surrender it to the state.

20:19.721 --> 20:21.154
Welcome to keep it?

20:21.179 --> 20:24.113
Ms. Allen, this contract
seems to protect everyone

20:24.138 --> 20:26.717
but Ms. Desai and that baby.

20:27.442 --> 20:30.802
I'm sorry, but that is the arrangement

20:30.827 --> 20:32.944
she willingly agreed to.

20:33.912 --> 20:35.585
