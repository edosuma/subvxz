WEBVTT

00:03.833 --> 00:06.467
PREVIOUSLY ON "I AM JAZZ"...

00:06.467 --> 00:08.100
WAIT, SO IS THAT LIKE
A REAL TATTOO OR IS

00:08.100 --> 00:09.267
YEAH,
IT'S A FIBONACCI SPIRAL.

00:09.267 --> 00:10.733
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
DO YOU WANT A TATTOO?

00:10.733 --> 00:12.033
OH, HELL-TO-THE-YES.

00:12.033 --> 00:14.300
HAVE YOU EVER DATED SOMEONE
WHO'S TRANSGENDER?

00:14.300 --> 00:15.133
NO.

00:15.133 --> 00:16.533
IS THAT WEIRD FOR YOU?

00:16.533 --> 00:18.600
BEING PANSEXUAL LIKE,
LITERALLY, NOTHING MATTERS.

00:18.600 --> 00:20.133
OKAY, GOOD.

00:20.133 --> 00:23.100
THIS DATE, HONESTLY, WENT BETTER
ANYTHING I COULD'VE HOPED FOR.

00:23.100 --> 00:26.067
Bowers: YOU WANT TO BE ON THE
LOWER END OF THE B.M.I. SCALE.

00:26.067 --> 00:28.400
IF IT'S REALLY NOT RIGHT,
THE DATE DOESN'T GET SET.

00:28.400 --> 00:29.567
Jazz:
HOLD ON, I'M TOO TIRED.

00:29.567 --> 00:30.867
WE'VE BEEN PLAYING
FOR 10 MINUTES.

00:30.867 --> 00:32.767
WELL, WHATEVER!
LOOK AT YOU AND LOOK AT ME!

00:32.767 --> 00:33.900
I'M A FAT-ASS!

00:33.900 --> 00:36.133
I NEED TO LOSE 30 POUNDS.

00:36.133 --> 00:38.900
THE REASON WHY IT'S SO DIFFICULT
IS 'CAUSE I'M A BINGE EATER.

00:38.900 --> 00:41.800
SHE HAS TO HAVE TWO LETTERS
FROM TWO DIFFERENT THERAPISTS

00:41.800 --> 00:45.267
SAYING THAT SHE IS MENTALLY
SOUND TO HAVE THE SURGERY.

00:45.267 --> 00:47.200
Woman: I COULD LIKE
TO HAVE YOU COME BACK.

00:47.200 --> 00:50.300
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT WEIGHT,
IT'S ABOUT BEHIND IT.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.800
Jazz: GETTING MY LETTERS
WILL BE HARDER

00:52.800 --> 00:54.400
THAN I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT.

00:54.400 --> 00:56.633
WE'RE GOING TO REVISIT
A PAST LIFE THAT'S GOING TO

00:56.633 --> 00:58.733
EVALUATE AND OFFER HEALING
TO YOUR BINGE EATING.

00:58.733 --> 01:00.767
I'M OPEN TO OPEN
TO PAST LIFE REGRESSION,

01:00.767 --> 01:02.867
BECAUSE IN ORDER
TO GET THE SURGERY,

01:02.867 --> 01:05.167
I NEED TO NOT ONLY
LOSE THE 30 POUNDS,

01:05.167 --> 01:07.500
BUT I NEED TO
MAINTAIN MY WEIGHT.

01:07.500 --> 01:08.767
HOW DO YOU FEEL
COMING OUT OF THAT,

01:08.767 --> 01:11.500
AS FAR AS THE ANALOGY
OF BEING HUNGRY FOR FOOD,

01:11.500 --> 01:13.600
BUT ALSO HUNGRY
FOR SOMETHING ELSE?

01:13.600 --> 01:15.067
IT WAS JUST ACCEPTANCE.

01:15.067 --> 01:17.533
I WAS DEFINITELY ABLE
TO CONNECT A FEW DOTS.

01:17.533 --> 01:20.367
I BINGE EAT TO MAKE
MYSELF FEEL HAPPIER

01:20.367 --> 01:25.800
AND I FEEL LIKE I FINALLY
UNDERSTAND WHY THAT IS.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.867
16 YEARS AGO,
I WAS ASSIGNED MALE AT BIRTH,

01:28.867 --> 01:31.233
BUT INSIDE,
I ALWAYS KNEW I WAS A GIRL.

01:31.233 --> 01:33.667
I HAVE A GIRL BRAIN
AND A BOY BODY.

01:33.667 --> 01:36.167
BEING TRANSGENDER
HASN'T BEEN EASY.

01:36.167 --> 01:38.300
WE REALLY ARE WALKING
A TIGHTROPE.

01:38.300 --> 01:40.267
-I'M A TOUGH CASE.
-YOU'RE A TOUGH CASE.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.767
COME ON, JAZZ!
WHOO!

01:41.767 --> 01:44.200
GO FOR IT, GIRL!

01:44.200 --> 01:46.367
BUT IT'S MADE ME WHO I AM.

01:46.367 --> 01:48.233
I AM JAZZ.

01:55.433 --> 01:56.933
READY FOR
THE BIG TENNIS MATCH?

01:56.933 --> 01:57.900
OH, YEAH.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.633
LITTLE
WIMBLEDON CHAMPIONSHIP.

01:59.633 --> 02:01.733
WE'LL JUST RALLY BACK
AND FORTH, YOU KNOW?

02:01.733 --> 02:05.600
I'M REALLY HAPPY MY PARENTS
ALLOW ME TO DO VIRTUAL SCHOOL,

02:05.600 --> 02:08.167
HOWEVER, I MUST FOLLOW
CERTAIN CONDITIONS.

02:08.167 --> 02:12.767
I NEED TO GET MY EXERCISE
AND CONTINUE MY PATH

02:12.767 --> 02:14.567
OF HEALTHY EATING
AND LOSING WEIGHT.

02:14.567 --> 02:16.333
I'M READY FOR YA.
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN MOVE

02:16.333 --> 02:18.600
WITH ALL THESE
TENNIS BALLS, BUT...

02:18.600 --> 02:21.300
OH, CRAP. SLOW START,
SLOW START, SLOW START.

02:21.300 --> 02:22.900
EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT THE BEST,

02:22.900 --> 02:25.567
I PREFER TENNIS OVER
OTHER FORMS OF EXERCISE,

02:25.567 --> 02:28.567
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
REALLY FOCUSED ON, YOU KNOW,

02:28.567 --> 02:31.133
WORKING OUT RATHER
THAN JUST PLAYING.

02:31.133 --> 02:34.067
YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T PLAYED
TENNIS IN A LONG TIME.

02:34.067 --> 02:35.900
AND BEING WITH MY DAD
IS ALSO GREAT,

02:35.900 --> 02:38.833
'CAUSE ANY TIME I COULD SPEND
TIME WITH HIM, YOU KNOW,

02:38.833 --> 02:41.733
I VALUE THOSE MOMENTS.

02:41.733 --> 02:44.100
OOH!

02:44.100 --> 02:45.333
OH, THAT'S NICE.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.700
AH, GOOD TRY.

02:46.700 --> 02:47.500
THAT WAS GOOD.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.267
LET'S TAKE A BREAK.

02:49.267 --> 02:52.100
Greg: PLAYING TENNIS WITH JAZZ
IS PART OF THE PLAN

02:52.100 --> 02:53.967
TO KEEP JAZZ ACTIVE AND HEALTHY.

02:53.967 --> 02:56.400
IT'S ALSO SOME GOOD
DADDY/DAUGHTER TIME.

02:56.400 --> 02:57.967
JAZZ IS GETTING OLDER.

02:57.967 --> 03:00.533
IT'S NOT ALWAYS SO EASY
GETTING TOGETHER

03:00.533 --> 03:03.300
WITH YOUR TEENAGE DAUGHTER
AND ANY TIME SPORTS

03:03.300 --> 03:05.867
CAN BE INVOLVED IN IT, IT
MAKES IT THAT MUCH MORE FUN.

03:05.867 --> 03:06.967
DUCKS.

03:06.967 --> 03:08.667
THAT WAS FUN.

03:08.667 --> 03:11.800
SO, WE NEED TO TALK MORE
ABOUT THIS VOW RENEWAL.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.400
THE KIDS AND I HAVE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT CELEBRATING

03:14.400 --> 03:16.667
JEANETTE AND MY
24th ANNIVERSARY,

03:16.667 --> 03:18.567
AND I THINK IT'S
A REALLY GREAT IDEA

03:18.567 --> 03:21.467
TO HAVE A WEDDING VOW RENEWAL
AND SURPRISE JEANETTE.

03:21.467 --> 03:23.400
'CAUSE I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN
SHE WANTED TO DO IT,

03:23.400 --> 03:25.700
BUT THAT'S REALLY HARD
TO SURPRISE.

03:25.700 --> 03:28.433
Woman:
ARE YOU A ROMANTIC GUY?

03:31.233 --> 03:33.533
SOMETIMES MY DAD NEEDS
A LITTLE BIT OF HELP

03:33.533 --> 03:35.067
IN THE ROMANCE DEPARTMENT.

03:35.067 --> 03:36.533
I'M JUST TRYING TO COME UP
WITH A GOOD COVER,

03:36.533 --> 03:38.333
'CAUSE WE HAVE TO
HIDE IT FROM MOM.

03:38.333 --> 03:42.100
I'M THINKING THAT WE SAY
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE

03:42.100 --> 03:44.867
MY BIRTHDAY AND WE'RE
GOING TO GO TO CLUB MED.

03:44.867 --> 03:46.267
'CAUSE YOU REMEMBER
WHEN I WAS REALLY YOUNG,

03:46.267 --> 03:48.800
LIKE TWO, THREE YEARS OLD,
WE USED TO GO FOR MY BIRTHDAY?

03:48.800 --> 03:50.867
YEAH, NO, IT MAKES SENSE.
I JUST DON'T KNOW WITH MOM.

03:50.867 --> 03:52.300
SHE'S SUCH A...

03:52.300 --> 03:54.100
I DON'T -- I DON'T THINK
SHE'LL CATCH ON TO IT.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.333
THIS IS A GREAT IDEA.

03:55.333 --> 03:57.867
JAZZ'S 17th BIRTHDAY
IS THE SAME WEEKEND.

03:57.867 --> 03:59.267
AND IT'S ACTUALLY PERFECT,

03:59.267 --> 04:01.267
BECAUSE WE USED
TO GO TO CLUB MED

04:01.267 --> 04:02.800
ALL THE TIME
FOR JAZZ'S BIRTHDAY.

04:02.800 --> 04:06.833
IT'S NICE ON JAZZ'S PART
TO THINK MORE ABOUT US

04:06.833 --> 04:08.533
THAN HER OWN OCCASION.

04:08.533 --> 04:09.867
IT'S THE PERFECT PLACE,

04:09.867 --> 04:11.700
'CAUSE IT HAS A LOT
OF SENTIMENTAL VALUE FOR HER

04:11.700 --> 04:13.067
AND THE ENTIRE FAMILY.

04:13.067 --> 04:14.333
OKAY, LET'S TRY
AND COORDINATE IT.

04:14.333 --> 04:15.900
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S
GOING TO BE EASY,

04:15.900 --> 04:18.867
BECAUSE SHE'S ALWAYS IN TUNE
WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON.

04:18.867 --> 04:20.067
YEAH, BUT --

04:20.067 --> 04:21.667
BUT IF WE CAN SURPRISE HER,
THAT WOULD BE --

04:21.667 --> 04:23.067
THAT'D BE A BIG WIN.

04:23.067 --> 04:24.300
WHAT WOULD MAKE HER THINK
THAT WE'RE GOING TO

04:24.300 --> 04:28.500
CLUB MED TO DO
A WEDDING VOW RENEWAL?

04:28.500 --> 04:30.733
JAZZ IS THE MOST LIKELY
TO BLOW THE SECRET.

04:30.733 --> 04:34.067
SHE JUST HAS A HISTORY
OF -- I DON'T KNOW.

04:34.067 --> 04:38.233
I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE ALWAYS
RUINS SECRETS.

04:38.233 --> 04:40.300
THIS WOULD ACTUALLY BE
A REALLY BEAUTIFUL IDEA

04:40.300 --> 04:42.467
AND I COULD SURPRISE MOM
AND GIVE HER A GIFT

04:42.467 --> 04:43.933
THAT SHE'S ALWAYS WANTED.

04:43.933 --> 04:45.967
NOW, WE JUST GOT TO MAKE SURE
THE KIDS ARE GOING TO BE FREE

04:45.967 --> 04:47.833
FROM SCHOOL, BUT, YEAH,
WE'LL FOCUS ON YOUR BIRTHDAY.

04:47.833 --> 04:49.367
LET'S START TALKING UP
YOUR BIRTHDAY.

04:49.367 --> 04:51.467
I REALLY THINK MOM'S
GOING TO BE ECSTATIC,

04:51.467 --> 04:54.267
SO WHEN SHE FINDS OUT,
SHE'S GOING TO BE LIKE, "OOH!"

04:54.267 --> 04:56.900
AND SHE'LL START CRYING
FOR ABOUT 20 YEARS.

04:58.900 --> 05:03.067
**

05:03.067 --> 05:04.933
HEY, IT'S GOING TO GET
LOUD IN HERE.

05:06.333 --> 05:09.100
**

05:11.633 --> 05:12.900
**

05:12.900 --> 05:14.633
AND IT'S MADE WITH
SO MUCH SPINACH,

05:14.633 --> 05:18.567
YOU GET YOUR LEAFY GREENS IN
FOR THE DAY, JUST WITH THAT.

05:18.567 --> 05:20.233
-I LIKE IT.

05:20.233 --> 05:21.467
-IT IS GOOD.
-MMM.

05:21.467 --> 05:23.200
Greg: HEY, JAZZ, HAVE YOU
GIVEN ANY THOUGHT ABOUT

05:23.200 --> 05:25.067
WHAT YOU WANT
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY?

05:25.067 --> 05:26.800
I JUST WANT TO DO SOMETHING
WITH THE FAMILY,

05:26.800 --> 05:29.200
SOMETHING FUN WHERE
WE'RE ALL TOGETHER.

05:29.200 --> 05:31.467
WE COULD JUST DRIVE UP
TO CLUB MED FOR A DAY.

05:31.467 --> 05:33.767
I DON'T CARE WHAT WE DO.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.100
YOU'RE 17!

05:35.100 --> 05:37.467
ONE YEAR FROM BEGINNING
MY 18th YEAR,

05:37.467 --> 05:39.100
WHICH MEANS I'M GOING
TO BE AN ADULT.

05:39.100 --> 05:41.867
Jazz: I'M EXCITED ABOUT
TURNING 17 NEXT WEEKEND,

05:41.867 --> 05:45.800
BECAUSE IT MAKES ME THAT
MUCH CLOSER TO BEING AN ADULT.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.967
I LOVE BEING INDEPENDENT.

05:47.967 --> 05:50.933
I WANTED TO ASK YOU GUYS,
FOR MY BIRTHDAY OR FOR WHATEVER,

05:50.933 --> 05:52.333
THERE'S SOMETHING
I'VE BEEN WANTING FOR A WHILE.

05:52.333 --> 05:56.967
I KNOW YOU MIGHT
NOT LIKE THIS.

05:56.967 --> 05:59.733
I'M JUST GUESSING WHAT
SHE'S GOING TO ASK FOR.

05:59.733 --> 06:02.467
DO YOU THINK
I COULD GET A TATTOO?

06:02.467 --> 06:05.167
**

06:05.167 --> 06:06.367
I DON'T KNOW.

06:06.367 --> 06:09.100
LIKE, A REALLY, LIKE,
NO BIGGER THAN THIS.

06:09.100 --> 06:11.467
IT DEPENDS.

06:11.467 --> 06:12.867
Jeanette:
JAZZ IS AN INDIVIDUAL.

06:12.867 --> 06:15.133
SHE LIKES TO EXPRESS
HERSELF,

06:15.133 --> 06:19.133
AND TATTOOS ARE ARTISTRY
ON THE BODY.

06:19.133 --> 06:22.833
SO, I'M SUPPORTIVE OF IT.
I'M NOT AGAINST IT.

06:22.833 --> 06:26.767
MY INITIAL REACTION IS,
CAN YOU JUST GET, LIKE,

06:26.767 --> 06:29.067
A PAINT-ON TATTOO,
ONE THAT WASHES OFF

06:29.067 --> 06:30.867
AND JUST SEE IF YOU
LIKE IT FIRST?

06:30.867 --> 06:32.933
THERE ARE THE ONES THAT COME
IN THE GUMBALL MACHINES.

06:32.933 --> 06:34.533
AND YOU GET THAT LITTLE BALL
AND YOU BREAK IT IN HALF,

06:34.533 --> 06:36.067
IT'S LIKE A LITTLE
PIRATE TATTOO.

06:36.067 --> 06:38.600
SO, YOU WERE THE KID,
"MOM, GIVE ME 5 CENTS."

06:38.600 --> 06:39.500
MM-HMM.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.733
-KEPT GETTING IT.
-I WAS THAT KID.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.467
I WAS NOT.

06:42.467 --> 06:44.367
WHERE WERE
YOU CONTEMPLATING?

06:44.367 --> 06:46.567
SHOULDER?
THAT COULD BE GOOD.

06:46.567 --> 06:49.067
MAYBE LIKE KIND OF
LIKE COLLARBONE, NECK,

06:49.067 --> 06:50.067
BUT THAT'S MORE VISIBLE.

06:50.067 --> 06:51.300
-OKAY, NO, NO.
-NO, NO, NOT TOO --

06:51.300 --> 06:53.733
I WAS THINKING,
IT COULD SAY,

06:53.733 --> 06:55.967
"DADDY'S GIRL."

06:55.967 --> 06:58.067
Jeanette: I WAS JUST ABOUT TO
SAY GET IT ON YOUR UPPER BUTT,

06:58.067 --> 07:00.800
BUT WHEN YOU SAID,
"DADDY'S GIRL," I'M LIKE, NO!

07:00.800 --> 07:02.367
OH, MY GOD.

07:02.367 --> 07:04.733
Jazz: WHEN IT COMES TO ME
GETTING A TATTOO,

07:04.733 --> 07:08.567
I KNOW MY DAD MIGHT HAVE
SOME CONCERNS, HOWEVER,

07:08.567 --> 07:10.933
I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY,
HE'LL COME AROUND,

07:10.933 --> 07:14.533
AND IF HE DOESN'T THEN
I'LL BE REALLY UPSET.

07:14.533 --> 07:17.100
ANYWAY, DON'T WE HAVE
TO CALL MARCI BOWERS?

07:17.100 --> 07:18.600
OR IS SHE CALLING US?

07:18.600 --> 07:19.533
I THINK WE'RE
FaceTimeing HER, RIGHT?

07:19.533 --> 07:20.733
WE HAVE TO CALL HER.
YEAH.

07:20.733 --> 07:23.400
Jazz: SINCE THE LAST TIME
I SPOKE TO DR. BOWERS,

07:23.400 --> 07:26.433
I'VE BEEN IN THIS CONSTANT
YO-YO BATTLE OF LOSING WEIGHT

07:26.433 --> 07:30.167
AND GAINING WEIGHT, SO SHE JUST
WANTS TO SEE THAT I AM ON TRACK

07:30.167 --> 07:32.667
AND WE COULD POTENTIALLY SET
A DATE TO GET

07:32.667 --> 07:35.367
THE GENDER CONFIRMATION SURGERY.

07:35.367 --> 07:37.433
-HEY.
-HI.

07:37.433 --> 07:38.733
-HELLO.

07:38.733 --> 07:40.800
-IT'S MY FAVORITE FAMILY.
-AWW!

07:40.800 --> 07:42.767
Bowers: WE HAVEN'T TALKED
FOR A WHILE. HOW'S IT GOING?

07:42.767 --> 07:44.067
GOOD.

07:44.067 --> 07:46.433
IN TERMS OF LIKE,
MY DIET AND WEIGHT LOSS,

07:46.433 --> 07:48.800
I'M BACK ON TRACK NOW,
SO THAT'S GOOD.

07:48.800 --> 07:51.433
WITHIN THE PAST FEW WEEKS,
I'VE LOST 10 POUNDS,

07:51.433 --> 07:54.367
SO I'M ONE-THIRD
OF THE WAY THERE.

07:54.367 --> 07:56.733
OKAY, CAN YOU GIVE ME
THAT NUMBER?

07:56.733 --> 07:58.633
OF WHAT I WEIGH?

07:58.633 --> 08:01.133
-YES.
-UHH...

08:01.133 --> 08:04.100
YOU HAVE TO REALIZE,
I'M NOT BEING MEAN,

08:04.100 --> 08:07.300
I'M SAYING THAT IF YOU'RE
RUNNING A HIGHER B.M.I.

08:07.300 --> 08:10.500
THAN WE WANT, IT'S GOING
TO BE A PROBLEM.

08:10.500 --> 08:14.700
I CANNOT DO SURGERY
IF YOU ARE NOT PERFECT.

08:14.700 --> 08:17.333
DR. BOWERS IS VERY FIRM
WITH THE FACT

08:17.333 --> 08:19.167
THAT I HAVE TO LOSE 30 POUNDS

08:19.167 --> 08:21.100
OR ELSE I'M NOT
GETTING THE SURGERY.

08:21.100 --> 08:24.100
IT'S VERY INTIMIDATING
AND PUTS A LOT OF PRESSURE ON ME

08:24.100 --> 08:28.200
WHEN SHE'S SO STERN WITH HOW
SHE WANTS ME TO DO THIS.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.367
UHH. THIS IS MY WEIGHT
RIGHT NOW.

08:30.367 --> 08:32.667
AGAIN, IF WE'RE NOT
AT THAT PERFECT NUMBER,

08:32.667 --> 08:34.533
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUSH
IT OFF TO THE NEXT SUMMER,

08:34.533 --> 08:37.300
WHICH WOULD MAKE YOU 18.

08:37.300 --> 08:39.267
MM-HMM.

08:39.267 --> 08:42.333
AND I WILL DO IT.
I HAVE TO -- I HAVE NO CHOICE.

08:42.333 --> 08:44.133
I KNOW. OF COURSE.

08:44.133 --> 08:48.067
SO, HOW FAR IN ADVANCE DOES
SHE NEED TO REACH THE TARGET

08:48.067 --> 08:49.400
FOR YOU TO SAY,

08:49.400 --> 08:50.967
"I COULD PUT YOU
ON THE CALENDAR"

08:50.967 --> 08:52.533
FOR THE PROCEDURE ITSELF?

08:52.533 --> 08:55.267
REALLY, WE SHOULD BE THINKING
THREE MONTHS BEFORE SURGERY,

08:55.267 --> 08:57.267
BECAUSE I HAVE
TO GET APPROVALS.

08:57.267 --> 08:58.333
WE HAVE TO BE PLANNING.

08:58.333 --> 09:00.433
WE HAVE TO SET THE O.R. UP.

09:00.433 --> 09:01.933
THERE'S A LOT TO DO,

09:01.933 --> 09:03.833
SO, I MEAN,
THIS IS REALLY SERIOUS NOW.

09:03.833 --> 09:05.100
YEAH.

09:05.100 --> 09:06.600
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE TIME
WILL JUST SLIP BY.

09:06.600 --> 09:10.067
JAZZ DOES HAVE A TENDENCY
TO PROCRASTINATE.

09:10.067 --> 09:12.433
I THINK THE DEADLINE
FOR THE WEIGHT LOSS

09:12.433 --> 09:14.167
WILL GIVE JAZZ AN INCENTIVE.

09:14.167 --> 09:16.867
I THINK IT WILL MOTIVATE JAZZ
TO WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT MORE.

09:16.867 --> 09:18.900
ARE YOU WORKING ON THE LETTERS?

09:18.900 --> 09:21.067
WELL, WE'VE BEEN GETTING
OUR DUCKS IN A ROW THERE.

09:21.067 --> 09:23.333
BUT SHE HAS TO GO
TO DR. VOLKER AGAIN.

09:23.333 --> 09:24.733
OKAY, THAT IS GOOD.

09:24.733 --> 09:28.433
WE'RE SEEING DR. VOLKER
FOR THE SECOND TIME

09:28.433 --> 09:29.700
TO TRY AND GET THE LETTER,

09:29.700 --> 09:31.067
BECAUSE THE FIRST TIME,

09:31.067 --> 09:32.967
DR. VOLKER WAS NOT READY
TO GIVE JAZZ A LETTER

09:32.967 --> 09:35.367
AND SHE CAN'T HAVE
THE SURGERY WITHOUT IT.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.667
OKAY, EVERYBODY.
HAVE A GREAT DAY.

09:37.667 --> 09:38.533
-BYE.
-YOU, TOO.

09:38.533 --> 09:39.867
BYE.

09:39.867 --> 09:42.500
ALL RIGHT, I'M HOPPING
ON THE BIKE NOW.

09:42.500 --> 09:46.867
I DEFINITELY HAVE MADE PROGRESS,
BUT I NEED TO MAKE EVEN MORE

09:46.867 --> 09:49.700
TO PROVE TO HER THAT
I AM TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY.

09:49.700 --> 09:52.067
GETTING THE SURGERY
THIS SUMMER IS A MUST

09:52.067 --> 09:54.067
AND I'M GOING
TO LOSE THIS WEIGHT.

09:54.067 --> 09:56.567
LET'S GRIND IT.

09:56.567 --> 09:58.567
YEAH.

09:58.567 --> 10:01.833
**

10:01.833 --> 10:05.100
**

10:05.100 --> 10:07.100
-HEY.
-HI, SWEETHEART.

10:07.100 --> 10:09.667
TONIGHT, MY DAD AND I ARE GOING
TO MY GRANDPARENTS' HOUSE

10:09.667 --> 10:12.567
TO TELL THEM ABOUT THE SURPRISE
WEDDING VOW RENEWAL

10:12.567 --> 10:14.500
AND TO FIGURE OUT
SOME OF THE DETAILS.

10:14.500 --> 10:17.233
JAZZ, WHY DON'T YOU TELL GRANDMA
AND GRANDPA ABOUT THIS IDEA?

10:17.233 --> 10:18.633
YEAH, WHAT?

10:18.633 --> 10:22.100
UM, WE CAME HERE TO DISCUSS
A SURPRISE THAT WE HAVE FOR MOM.

10:22.100 --> 10:24.000
RIGHT NOW, SHE THINKS
WE'RE GOING TO CLUB MED

10:24.000 --> 10:25.567
TO CELEBRATE MY BIRTHDAY,

10:25.567 --> 10:27.967
BUT REALLY, WE'RE HAVING
A SECOND WEDDING,

10:27.967 --> 10:29.700
RENEWING MOM'S VOWS.

10:29.700 --> 10:31.600
OH, YOU'RE GOING TO
MAKE ME CRY.

10:31.600 --> 10:35.933
I THINK PLANNING VOW RENEWAL FOR
JEANETTE AND GREG IS TERRIFIC.

10:35.933 --> 10:39.200
I HAVE TO BE HONEST. WE'VE NEVER
CONSIDERED A VOW RENEWAL,

10:39.200 --> 10:40.567
BUT THE BEST WE CAN SAY,

10:40.567 --> 10:42.500
WE'VE NEVER CONSIDERED
A DIVORCE.

10:44.367 --> 10:46.967
WHAT A GREAT IDEA.
WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS?

10:46.967 --> 10:49.567
WAS THIS YOUR IDEA, GREG?

10:49.567 --> 10:51.033
SORT OF?

10:51.033 --> 10:53.967
Greg: EVEN THOUGH I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN HESITANT TO DO IT,

10:53.967 --> 10:57.033
THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO JEANETTE.

10:57.033 --> 10:58.533
AND WHEN YOU'VE GOT FOUR KIDS,

10:58.533 --> 11:02.700
IT'S A LITTLE HARDER TO BE
ROMANTIC ON A REGULAR BASIS,

11:02.700 --> 11:06.467
SO I THINK THIS VOW RENEWAL
IS A NICE WAY TO REKINDLE.

11:06.467 --> 11:10.800
AND I -- I THINK WE NEED SOME
KIND OF MASTER OF CEREMONIES.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.267
**

11:13.267 --> 11:14.967
JACK, IS THAT SOMETHING
YOU WOULD WANT TO DO?

11:14.967 --> 11:17.200
YEAH, I HAVE SOMETHING
I WOULD WANT TO SAY.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.500
SO, YOU'RE IN?

11:18.500 --> 11:20.767
YOU -- UH,
YOU COULDN'T HOLD ME BACK.

11:20.767 --> 11:23.533
WHO SHOULD REAFFIRM FOR
THIS THING, OTHER THAN...

11:23.533 --> 11:25.133
FATHER JACK.

11:25.133 --> 11:28.933
THAN ME, WHO'VE KNOWN --
WHO'VE KNOWN THE KIDS

11:28.933 --> 11:30.200
SINCE THEY WERE KIDS.

11:30.200 --> 11:31.867
YOUR --
YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW AND I

11:31.867 --> 11:34.633
ARE GOING TO TRY OUR BEST
NOT TO HAVE TOO MANY TEARS.

11:34.633 --> 11:37.200
Jacky: BUT WE'LL HAVE A BUNCH OF
TISSUES READY FOR OUR DAUGHTER.

11:37.200 --> 11:40.067
YES. IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE
A BREAKING OF A DAM.

11:41.467 --> 11:43.767
I'M EVEN WELLING UP
THINKING ABOUT IT.

11:43.767 --> 11:46.533
SO, WE KNOW WHAT WE WANT
TO DO GENERALLY?

11:46.533 --> 11:48.867
I MEAN, WE HAVE TO HAVE HER GET
DRESSED AND EVERYTHING, RIGHT?

11:48.867 --> 11:50.400
YEAH, THAT'S A VERY
CRUCIAL THING.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.900
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DRESS?

11:51.900 --> 11:53.167
HOW WOULD YOU EVEN GET
A DRESS FOR HER?

11:53.167 --> 11:55.167
-DONE.

11:55.167 --> 11:56.367
DONE.

11:56.367 --> 11:59.833
OKAY, ONCE MOM
WOULD SEE A DRESS,

11:59.833 --> 12:03.167
SHE WOULD KNOW THIS CANNOT BE
YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY, RIGHT?

12:03.167 --> 12:04.200
YEAH.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.533
THE CAT'S OUT OF THE BAG.

12:05.533 --> 12:07.233
SHOULD WE, YOU KNOW...?

12:07.233 --> 12:08.333
YOU WANT TO TIP HER OFF, RIGHT?

12:08.333 --> 12:10.600
AND THE DRESS IS THE TIP OFF.

12:10.600 --> 12:13.267
HOW LONG DO YOU WANT HER
THINKING THAT WE'RE UP THERE

12:13.267 --> 12:15.067
FOR JUST JAZZ'S BIRTHDAY?

12:15.067 --> 12:18.067
I LIKE THIS IDEA OF THE DRESS
SURPRISING HER.

12:18.067 --> 12:19.867
ALL RIGHT, SO IF YOU'RE
COMING WITH MOM,

12:19.867 --> 12:22.433
THE BOYS ARE GETTING THERE HOW?

12:22.433 --> 12:23.567
THE KIDS ARE GOING
TO DRIVE DOWN.

12:23.567 --> 12:24.900
-THEY'LL MEET US THERE.

12:24.900 --> 12:25.767
-YEAH.
-OKAY.

12:25.767 --> 12:26.800
ALL RIGHT.

12:26.800 --> 12:27.867
ALL RIGHT,
SO WE'VE GOT THE VENUE,

12:27.867 --> 12:29.600
WE'VE GOT THE GENERAL IDEA.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.900
YEAH. SO, NOW, WE'VE
GOT TO FIGURE OUT

12:31.900 --> 12:33.900
WHAT'S GOING TO
ACTUALLY HAPPEN.

12:33.900 --> 12:36.600
**

12:36.600 --> 12:38.933
HOW HAS IT BEEN SINCE
I'VE SEEN YOU LAST?

12:38.933 --> 12:41.467
Jazz: MY POTENTIAL GENDER
CONFIRMATION SURGERY,

12:41.467 --> 12:45.200
IT'S LIKE ALL FALLING TO PIECES
UNLESS I GET THIS LETTER.

12:45.200 --> 12:46.667
WHERE IS EVERYONE?

12:46.667 --> 12:50.167
I'M GETTING A LITTLE ANXIOUS,
'CAUSE MOM IS VERY NOSY.

12:50.167 --> 12:51.533
I DON'T GO TO
THE FRONT DESK, LIKE...?

12:51.533 --> 12:53.733
NO, WE GOT YOU.

12:55.500 --> 12:59.200
**

12:59.200 --> 13:03.067
**

13:03.067 --> 13:05.300
Jeanette: SO, YOU READY
TO VISIT MARILYN?

13:05.300 --> 13:08.100
I DON'T KNOW. I'M KIND OF
NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS.

13:08.100 --> 13:10.467
Jazz: TODAY,
I AM VISITING DR. VOLKER

13:10.467 --> 13:13.667
TO MAKE A SECOND ATTEMPT
OF GETTING MY THERAPY LETTER.

13:13.667 --> 13:17.433
MY LAST SESSION WITH DR. VOLKER
DIDN'T GO TOO WELL.

13:17.433 --> 13:20.633
SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE WOULD NOT
PROVIDE THE FIRST THERAPY LETTER

13:20.633 --> 13:23.700
UNTIL I SHOW PROGRESS
IN LOSING WEIGHT.

13:23.700 --> 13:26.400
I FEEL LIKE, YEAH,
I'M ON THE RIGHT TRACK AGAIN,

13:26.400 --> 13:28.900
I'M LOSING WEIGHT, BUT LIKE,
I REALLY HAVEN'T MADE

13:28.900 --> 13:30.767
ANY SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS.

13:30.767 --> 13:32.900
I HAVE A FEELING, LIKE,
SHE'S NOT GOING TO SIGN IT OFF

13:32.900 --> 13:35.667
AND I'M NOT READY,
I'M NOT MENTALLY READY

13:35.667 --> 13:37.533
FOR THAT DISAPPOINTMENT
ONCE AGAIN.

13:37.533 --> 13:39.233
I'M TRYING TO BE
A LITTLE BIT HOPEFUL,

13:39.233 --> 13:41.567
BECAUSE I KNOW I'VE BEEN
EATING HEALTHIER

13:41.567 --> 13:43.567
AND I FEEL LIKE
I HAVE MADE PROGRESS,

13:43.567 --> 13:46.233
IN TERMS OF PREVENTING MYSELF
FROM BINGE EATING.

13:46.233 --> 13:49.433
SO, TELL ME MORE ABOUT
THE OUTING WITH VICTORIA.

13:49.433 --> 13:52.833
WE HAD A REALLY FUN TIME.
BUT, UM, I DON'T KNOW.

13:52.833 --> 13:55.300
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE LIKES ME
OR NOT, THOUGH, THAT WAY,

13:55.300 --> 13:58.433
BECAUSE I -- I DEFINITELY
THINK SHE'S REALLY PRETTY

13:58.433 --> 14:01.200
AND I'D TOTALLY BE OPEN TO
HAVING A RELATIONSHIP

14:01.200 --> 14:02.767
WITH HER, BUT --
REALLY?

14:02.767 --> 14:04.067
YEAH, DEFINITELY.

14:04.067 --> 14:05.367
LIKE, YOU HAVE --
DID YOU HAVE THE URGE LIKE,

14:05.367 --> 14:07.367
TO KISS HER GOODBYE?

14:07.367 --> 14:08.633
UM...

14:08.633 --> 14:11.067
NOT NECESSARILY,
JUST 'CAUSE LIKE, I'M NOT --

14:11.067 --> 14:13.733
YOU KNOW ME, I TAKE SLOW STEPS
AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE --

14:13.733 --> 14:15.500
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHERE HER HEAD IS AT.

14:15.500 --> 14:18.167
SO, DO YOU THINK YOU GUYS
WILL HANG OUT AGAIN?

14:18.167 --> 14:20.667
HOPEFULLY,
WE'LL HANGOUT SOON, YOU KNOW?

14:20.667 --> 14:23.067
Jeanette: JAZZ WANTS TO BE
IN LOVE MORE THAN ANYTHING

14:23.067 --> 14:25.233
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT HEARTBREAK

14:25.233 --> 14:27.333
IS JUST, LIKE,
THE WORST FEELING.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.233
AND HER ALREADY BEING, LIKE,

14:29.233 --> 14:31.100
OVER-THE-TOP,
WHERE IS THIS GOING?

14:31.100 --> 14:33.167
ARE THEY GOING TO BE FRIENDS
OR MORE THAN FRIENDS?

14:33.167 --> 14:35.700
IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT,
JAZZ WILL BE MISERABLE.

14:35.700 --> 14:36.833
MNH!

14:36.833 --> 14:37.733
WHAT?

14:37.733 --> 14:39.467
THERE'S SO MUCH PULP
IN THERE!

14:39.467 --> 14:41.867
THE TASTE IS FINE,
IT'S THE PULSE.

14:41.867 --> 14:43.167
-PULP.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.600
CAN I TAKE YOUR PULP?

14:47.333 --> 14:50.533
**

14:50.533 --> 14:51.700
COME ON.

14:51.700 --> 14:55.300
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND,
I'M A SLOW PERSON?

14:55.300 --> 14:58.533
-HELLO.
-HI, SWEETIE PIE.

14:58.533 --> 15:02.167
I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

15:02.167 --> 15:03.667
OF COURSE.

15:03.667 --> 15:05.933
THIS THERAPY LETTER IS REQUIRED
FOR ME TO GET THIS OPERATION.

15:05.933 --> 15:07.100
I'LL CLOSE THE DOOR.

15:07.100 --> 15:09.467
MY POTENTIAL GENDER
CONFIRMATION SURGERY,

15:09.467 --> 15:13.267
IT'S LIKE ALL FALLING TO PIECES
UNLESS I GET THIS LETTER.

15:13.267 --> 15:16.667
HOW HAS IT BEEN SINCE
I'VE SEEN YOU LAST?

15:16.667 --> 15:18.933
Volker: THE LAST TIME
WHEN I TALKED WITH JAZZ,

15:18.933 --> 15:22.267
AWE WERE JUST AT THE BEGINNING
OF IDENTIFYING

15:22.267 --> 15:24.567
THE EATING BEHAVIOR PATTERN

15:24.567 --> 15:28.667
AND I THINK THAT
SHE WAS NOT EXCITED

15:28.667 --> 15:31.667
ABOUT WORKING ON
THAT WEIGHT LOSS,

15:31.667 --> 15:33.800
AND I WAS CONCERNED.

15:33.800 --> 15:37.100
I MEAN, I'VE LOST 10 POUNDS,
SO THAT'S GOOD.

15:37.100 --> 15:40.233
I ONLY HAVE 20 MORE TO GO.
I'M ONE-THIRD OF THE WAY DONE.

15:40.233 --> 15:41.700
I'M IMPRESSED.

15:41.700 --> 15:43.533
I MEAN,
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT.

15:43.533 --> 15:45.700
I -- I FEEL LIKE IT
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT, BUT...

15:45.700 --> 15:47.333
WHAT DID YOU DO THAT
WAS DIFFERENT?

15:47.333 --> 15:50.533
IT HAS TO BE A BEHAVIOR,
BUT IT HAS TO BE A MINDSET, TOO.

15:50.533 --> 15:53.100
I MEAN, I'VE JUST KIND OF
BEEN RESISTING THE TEMPTATIONS

15:53.100 --> 15:54.633
AS MUCH AS I CAN.

15:54.633 --> 15:57.067
HAVE YOU EVER SAID,
"I'D LIKE TO EAT BAD,

15:57.067 --> 16:01.100
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M GOING
FOR THIS 20 MORE POUNDS,

16:01.100 --> 16:04.933
SO I'M GOING TO EAT
WHAT I WANT, BUT LESS"?

16:04.933 --> 16:07.233
THAT HAPPENS. I MEAN,
OBVIOUSLY, IN MY HEART,

16:07.233 --> 16:09.967
I'M LIKE, "I WANT MORE,
BLAH!", BUT LIKE IN MY MIND,

16:09.967 --> 16:12.167
I WAS LIKE, "NO, HONEY,
DON'T EAT MORE."

16:12.167 --> 16:14.933
WHAT DID YOU DO ABOUT
THE NIGHT EATING SO FAR,

16:14.933 --> 16:17.667
LIKE WHEN YOU REALLY
WANT TO SNACK?

16:17.667 --> 16:19.900
I GO TO SLEEP.

16:19.900 --> 16:20.767
WITHOUT EATING?

16:20.767 --> 16:23.767
YEAH.
I DID LAST NIGHT.

16:23.767 --> 16:26.100
WHOA.
WAS IT DIFFICULT TO DO?

16:26.100 --> 16:27.067
YEAH.

16:27.067 --> 16:28.700
BUT YOU'RE SEEING,
AT THAT TIME,

16:28.700 --> 16:31.067
AT THAT PLACE, THAT WORKS.

16:31.067 --> 16:32.467
YAY, YOU.

16:32.467 --> 16:36.433
WHEN JAZZ TELLS ME THAT SHE
STOPS HERSELF FROM OVEREATING,

16:36.433 --> 16:40.900
I FEEL VERY HOPEFUL,
BECAUSE SHE'S ABLE TO IDENTIFY,

16:40.900 --> 16:44.767
"WHEN I AM IN THIS SITUATION,
I NEED TO REALLY BE MINDFUL."

16:44.767 --> 16:47.467
LAST TIME, SHE DIDN'T
STOP HERSELF.

16:47.467 --> 16:52.367
SINCE THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU,
YOU ARE REALLY HONING,

16:52.367 --> 16:58.100
"HOW I CAN SHAPE HEALTHY
EMOTIONS FOR HEALTHY BEHAVIOR."

16:58.100 --> 17:01.767
I HAVE BEEN VISITING A --
A HYPNOTHERAPIST,

17:01.767 --> 17:04.900
SO SHE'S BEEN HELPING
ME OUT WITH THIS PROCESS,

17:04.900 --> 17:06.733
AND I GUESS
IT'S BEEN WORKING,

17:06.733 --> 17:10.667
'CAUSE I'M LOSING WEIGHT, AND
NOW I'M, LIKE, BACK ON TRACK.

17:10.667 --> 17:12.067
I WANT TO --
I WANT TO TELL YOU,

17:12.067 --> 17:13.067
I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU.

17:13.067 --> 17:13.667
COOL.

17:13.667 --> 17:14.867
I REALLY AM.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.167
WE'RE GOING TO CALL MOM IN.

17:16.167 --> 17:18.800
HEY, MOM?! COME ON BACK!
MOM?!

17:18.800 --> 17:21.933
I THINK I'M VERY CLOSE TO WHAT
DR. VOLKER WOULD LIKE TO SEE.

17:21.933 --> 17:24.633
HOWEVER, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT
MEANS SHE'S GOING TO GIVE ME

17:24.633 --> 17:27.400
THE LETTER OR NOT, SO WHO KNOWS?

17:27.400 --> 17:28.933
I AM REALLY THRILLED.

17:28.933 --> 17:33.067
I -- I CAN SEE THAT
YOUR DETERMINATION

17:33.067 --> 17:35.800
AND ALSO YOUR WORK
WITH THE HYPNOTHERAPIST

17:35.800 --> 17:38.067
IS REALLY HELPING.

17:38.067 --> 17:39.867
I WANT TO CALL DR. BOWERS.

17:39.867 --> 17:41.967
I WANT TO WORK TOGETHER
ON THE TEAM.

17:41.967 --> 17:46.533
I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT
I HAVE SEEN THIS PROGRESS.

17:46.533 --> 17:51.867
AND WHEN I SEE ENOUGH OF THAT,
THEN I WRITE THAT LETTER.

17:51.867 --> 17:55.300
Jeanette: WHEN DR. VOLKER
ASKED TO SPEAK TO DR. BOWERS,

17:55.300 --> 17:56.733
I THINK IT'S A SIGN OF PROGRESS.

17:56.733 --> 17:59.100
IT MEANS THAT WE'RE HEADED
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION,

17:59.100 --> 18:01.567
HOWEVER, JAZZ STILL HAS
TO HONOR HER COMMITMENTS

18:01.567 --> 18:03.133
BEFORE SHE'S GOING
TO WRITE THE LETTER.

18:03.133 --> 18:05.867
AWW. GIVE ME YOUR HUGS.
YAY, YAY, YAY.

18:05.867 --> 18:09.100
Jazz:
I UNDERSTAND WHY DR. VOLKER
DIDN'T GIVE ME THE LETTER,

18:09.100 --> 18:11.300
HOWEVER,
I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED.

18:11.300 --> 18:13.600
-THANK YOU.
-BYE-BYE, SWEETIE.

18:13.600 --> 18:17.933
**

18:17.933 --> 18:22.267
**

18:22.267 --> 18:26.600
**

18:26.600 --> 18:29.300
Greg: HOW DID EVERYTHING GO
WITH DR. VOLKER?

18:29.300 --> 18:30.533
I WASN'T IN THE ROOM.

18:30.533 --> 18:33.433
I WAS JUST THERE IN THE
BEGINNING AND AT THE END.

18:33.433 --> 18:37.267
AND CUT TO THE CHASE,
WE STILL DON'T HAVE A LETTER.

18:37.267 --> 18:39.067
JAZZ IS ON THE RIGHT TRACK,

18:39.067 --> 18:43.067
BUT MARILYN WANTS TO TALK
TO DR. BOWERS.

18:43.067 --> 18:46.100
AND SHE STILL WANTS
TO SEE JAZZ MAKE MORE PROGRESS

18:46.100 --> 18:48.067
WITH THE B.M.I. SITUATION.

18:48.067 --> 18:50.533
I'M GLAD THAT THE DOCTORS
ARE RECOGNIZING

18:50.533 --> 18:52.400
THAT JAZZ
IS MAKING PROGRESS.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.733
I JUST NEED TO KNOW THAT
THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS

18:54.733 --> 18:56.267
ARE ALL IN AGREEMENT.

18:56.267 --> 18:58.767
IF THERE'S NOT
A UNANIMOUS CONSENSUS,

18:58.767 --> 19:02.333
THEN THE SURGERY'S
GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT.

19:02.333 --> 19:03.733
IT'S REALLY UP TO JAZZ.

19:03.733 --> 19:05.600
SHE NEEDS TO
GET HER ASS IN GEAR

19:05.600 --> 19:07.167
AND DO WHAT SHE NEEDS TO DO.

19:07.167 --> 19:08.400
I THINK SHE'LL DO IT.

19:08.400 --> 19:11.900
SHE'S BEEN EATING WELL,
DOING MORE ACTIVITIES.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.633
I THINK SHE'S TRYING.

19:13.633 --> 19:17.867
I WAS TALKING TO JAZZ
ABOUT CLUB MED.

19:17.867 --> 19:19.667
SUCH GOOD TIMES UP THERE.

19:19.667 --> 19:21.800
WHEN JEANETTE SAYS THAT
SHE HAD BEEN TALKING TO JAZZ

19:21.800 --> 19:23.967
ABOUT CLUB MED,
I'M A LITTLE BIT WORRIED,

19:23.967 --> 19:26.567
BECAUSE SOMETIMES
JAZZ SPILLS THE BEANS.

19:26.567 --> 19:28.467
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

19:28.467 --> 19:30.500
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:30.500 --> 19:32.500
I TOLD HER,
ON HER BIRTHDAY,

19:32.500 --> 19:35.333
IF SHE WANTS TO CHEAT,
THAT'S OKAY,

19:35.333 --> 19:36.667
BUT DON'T GO OVERBOARD.

19:36.667 --> 19:39.233
DON'T HAVE FOUR SLICES OF CAKE.
HAVE ONE SLICE.

19:39.233 --> 19:40.333
YEAH.

19:40.333 --> 19:42.133
I'M SO RELIEVED THAT
IT SEEMS LIKE

19:42.133 --> 19:46.367
JEANETTE DOESN'T KNOW WHY
EXACTLY WE'RE GOING TO CLUB MED.

19:46.367 --> 19:48.833
ONE OF THE THINGS
ABOUT CLUB MED IS...

19:48.833 --> 19:50.067
FOOD.

19:50.067 --> 19:52.367
...IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A BIG,
BIG FOOD PLACE.

19:52.367 --> 19:54.667
ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT BUFFET
WITH CHOCOLATE BREAD.

19:54.667 --> 19:58.867
SO, DOES SHE THINK SHE'S GETTING
A TATTOO FOR HER BIRTHDAY?

19:58.867 --> 19:59.767
YEAH.

19:59.767 --> 20:00.900
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH IT

20:00.900 --> 20:02.200
IF YOU DON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH IT.

20:02.200 --> 20:05.033
AS LONG AS IT'S SUBTLE
AND IT'S, LIKE, NOT LIKE

20:05.033 --> 20:07.733
HERE OR ON HER FACE.

20:07.733 --> 20:12.000
I NOTICE THAT VICTORIA
HAD A LITTLE TATTOO.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.500
TRYING TO THINK.

20:13.500 --> 20:14.600
SHE HAD A -- A RING.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.633
DID SHE HAVE ONE
ON HER ARM, DOWN HERE?

20:16.633 --> 20:17.933
I DIDN'T STARE.
SHE MIGHT'VE.

20:17.933 --> 20:19.233
REMEMBER WHEN YOU
WERE YOUNGER,

20:19.233 --> 20:20.933
WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN
ALLOWED TO GET A TATTOO?

20:20.933 --> 20:24.000
HECK, NO! MY DAD?

20:24.000 --> 20:27.500
THERE'S DEFINITELY A FINE LINE
BETWEEN LETTING SOMEBODY

20:27.500 --> 20:30.033
JUST DO WHATEVER THEY WANT
AND HAVING SOME KIND

20:30.033 --> 20:31.400
OF PARENTAL CONTROLS.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.733
YOU KNOW, IT STARTED
WITH THE BLUE HAIR.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.300
TEAL.
SORRY. WHATEVER.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.067
TEAL HAIR.

20:36.067 --> 20:37.833
NOW, JAZZ WANTS A TATTOO.

20:37.833 --> 20:39.333
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,
ULTIMATELY,

20:39.333 --> 20:41.167
I KNOW
IF JAZZ WANTS A TATTOO,

20:41.167 --> 20:44.667
SHE'S GOING TO GET ONE,
PROBABLY WHEN I'M NOT LOOKING.

20:44.667 --> 20:46.000
YEAH, WE CAN CONTROL IT.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.333
BUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE AT
LEAST TALKING ABOUT IT,

20:47.333 --> 20:50.333
AT LEAST SHE'LL HEAR ME OUT
AS TO WHAT SIZE

20:50.333 --> 20:52.167
THE TATTOO SHOULD BE,
WHERE SHE SHOULD HAVE

20:52.167 --> 20:53.900
THAT TATTOO,
YOU KNOW, HOPEFULLY,

20:53.900 --> 20:55.900
SHE'LL BE SMART
WITH HER DECISION.

20:55.900 --> 20:57.733
LATER IN LIFE,
SHE COULD DO WHAT SHE WANTS,

20:57.733 --> 21:01.767
I GUESS, BUT RIGHT NOW, IF I GET
TO EXERT SOME KIND OF CONTROL,

21:01.767 --> 21:05.700
I'D LIKE HER TO DO IT IN A PLACE
WHERE IT GETS COVERED UP.

21:05.700 --> 21:06.967
LIKE WHERE?
AND IT'S NOT TOO BIG.

21:06.967 --> 21:08.500
SEE, I WOULD THINK
LIKE HERE IS A NICE --

21:08.500 --> 21:09.633
OH, NO, YOU DON'T LIKE --

21:09.633 --> 21:11.300
I THINK THIS WAY,
LET HER GO THROUGH IT,

21:11.300 --> 21:12.833
IF THAT'S WHAT SHE
REALLY WANTS TO DO.

21:12.833 --> 21:14.133
IT HAS TO BE NOT VISIBLE.

21:14.133 --> 21:16.533
YEAH, WE WON'T SIGN
UNTIL WE KNOW WHAT IT IS

21:16.533 --> 21:18.067
AND WHERE IT'S GOING.

21:18.067 --> 21:19.833
OKAY, LET'S GIVE HER
THE GREEN LIGHT,

21:19.833 --> 21:21.067
BUT WE NEED TO APPROVE --

21:21.067 --> 21:22.600
NO, LET'S NOT GIVE
A GREEN LIGHT.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.333
LET'S FIND OUT
EXACTLY WHAT IT IS --

21:24.333 --> 21:25.533
WHY'D YOU JUST CUT ME OFF?

21:25.533 --> 21:28.467
I SAID, GREEN LIGHT,
BUT WE NEED TO APPROVE IT.

21:28.467 --> 21:30.100
IT'S MORE LIKE,
WE NEED TO APPROVE IT,

21:30.100 --> 21:31.167
THEN WE GIVE
THE GREEN LIGHT.

21:31.167 --> 21:35.067
WHATEVER.
A YELLOW AND THEN A GREEN.

21:35.067 --> 21:37.267
JAZZ USUALLY DOESN'T CELEBRATE
HER BIRTHDAY DOING MUCH,

21:37.267 --> 21:39.400
SO I DO NOT THINK JAZZ
HAS ANY IDEA

21:39.400 --> 21:40.567
WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN TODAY.

21:40.567 --> 21:43.100
WAIT. WHY ARE YOU TURNING?
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

21:43.100 --> 21:45.333
**

21:47.667 --> 21:52.133
**

21:52.133 --> 21:56.633
**

21:56.633 --> 21:57.500
HEY.

21:57.500 --> 22:02.467
HEY.

22:02.467 --> 22:03.733
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

22:03.733 --> 22:06.867
YOU WANT TO GO LIKE SEE A MOVIE
OR GO GET ICE CREAM?

22:06.867 --> 22:08.833
WAIT, NO.
THE DIET, I FORGOT.

22:08.833 --> 22:12.067
YEAH, DIET. I MEAN, WE COULD
GO TO LIKE A CAFE, MAYBE?

22:12.067 --> 22:12.733
GET COFFEE?

22:12.733 --> 22:14.067
GET TEA, COFFEE, YEAH.

22:14.067 --> 22:16.233
-YEAH, SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA.
-I'M DOWN FOR THAT.

22:16.233 --> 22:18.533
Jazz: EVER SINCE I'VE BEEN
ENROLLED IN VIRTUAL SCHOOL,

22:18.533 --> 22:20.333
I'VE BEEN TRAPPED IN MY HOUSE,

22:20.333 --> 22:23.067
SO ANY OPPORTUNITY
THAT I CAN GET OUT

22:23.067 --> 22:25.767
AND HANG OUT WITH FRIENDS
IS JUST IMPORTANT TO ME.

22:25.767 --> 22:27.333
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY?

22:27.333 --> 22:30.133
I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING
PLANNED FOR MY BIRTHDAY,

22:30.133 --> 22:32.367
EXCEPT THAT
WE'RE SURPRISING MY MOM.

22:32.367 --> 22:35.567
WE'RE SETTING UP A WHOLE
VOW RENEWAL CEREMONY.

22:35.567 --> 22:37.400
OH, MY GOSH.
THAT'S GOING TO BE SO CUTE.

22:37.400 --> 22:40.500
I KNOW. SHE DOESN'T EVEN
KNOW IT'S HAPPENING AT ALL.

22:40.500 --> 22:42.900
JAZZ USUALLY DOESN'T CELEBRATE
HER BIRTHDAY DOING MUCH,

22:42.900 --> 22:44.767
SO I DO NOT THINK
JAZZ HAS ANY IDEA

22:44.767 --> 22:46.067
WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN TODAY.

22:46.067 --> 22:47.600
HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM VICTORIA LATELY?

22:47.600 --> 22:50.633
WE'VE BEEN TEXTING HERE
AND THERE, BUT NOT REALLY.

22:50.633 --> 22:53.700
I -- I STILL DON'T KNOW
IF SHE'S INTO ME OR NOT, SO...

22:53.700 --> 22:54.833
MAYBE SHE LIKES YOU.

22:54.833 --> 22:57.400
I THINK SHE DOES,
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

22:57.400 --> 23:00.167
I REALLY LIKE EVERY MOMENT
THAT I SPEND WITH HER.

23:00.167 --> 23:02.767
HOWEVER, VICTORIA HASN'T
TALKED ABOUT HANGING OUT AGAIN,

23:02.767 --> 23:05.100
SO I'M NOT SETTING
MY HOPES THAT HIGH,

23:05.100 --> 23:09.067
BUT I AM HOPING SHE'S
ON THE SAME PAGE AS ME.

23:09.067 --> 23:10.400
WAIT.
WHY ARE YOU TURNING?

23:10.400 --> 23:11.800
-I DON'T KNOW.

23:11.800 --> 23:13.667
I JUST SAW THIS TATTOO SHOP
AND I WANT TO LIKE,

23:13.667 --> 23:15.600
LOOK INSIDE OF IT FOR A LITTLE.
DO YOU MIND?

23:15.600 --> 23:16.933
I DON'T CARE.
YOU KNOW ME.

23:16.933 --> 23:19.133
I'VE WANTED A TATTOO
FOR A LONG TIME

23:19.133 --> 23:22.367
BECAUSE I REALLY BELIEVE
THAT YOUR BODY IS A CANVAS

23:22.367 --> 23:24.867
AND TATTOOS ARE PRETTY,
TATTOOS ARE COOL,

23:24.867 --> 23:26.700
ESPECIALLY IF
THEY MEAN SOMETHING.

23:26.700 --> 23:29.833
HOWEVER, MY PARENTS
DON'T LOVE THE IDEA OF ME

23:29.833 --> 23:32.233
GETTING A TATTOO
AT THE MOMENT.

23:32.233 --> 23:34.900
HI, GUYS.
CAN I HELP YOU?

23:34.900 --> 23:37.067
WELL, WE'RE JUST
CHECKING THINGS OUT, RIGHT?

23:37.067 --> 23:39.133
YEAH. DO YOU HAVE
ANYTHING WE COULD SEE?

23:39.133 --> 23:40.233
YEAH, WE HAVE
PORTFOLIOS OVER THERE.

23:40.233 --> 23:42.067
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS,
YOU CAN ASK US.

23:42.067 --> 23:43.700
-HEY.

23:43.700 --> 23:48.233
-HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
!

23:48.233 --> 23:50.067
-HI.
-THIS WAS ALL PLANNED.

23:50.067 --> 23:51.267
THIS WAS ALL PLANNED?

23:51.267 --> 23:52.467
-HI.
-WAIT.

23:52.467 --> 23:54.533
WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW?

23:54.533 --> 23:55.867
REMEMBER HOW WE TALKED,
THOUGH?

23:55.867 --> 23:57.700
WAIT, SO IS THAT LIKE
A REAL TATTOO OR IS IT...?

23:57.700 --> 23:59.400
YEAH, IT'S REAL. WHAT ABOUT YOU?
DO YOU WANT A TATTOO?

23:59.400 --> 24:00.667
OH, HELL-TO-THE-YES.

24:00.667 --> 24:02.367
WAIT, SO AM I GETTING
A TATTOO RIGHT NOW?

24:02.367 --> 24:05.967
YEP. AND I HAVE
SOMETHING ELSE FOR YOU.

24:05.967 --> 24:07.133
WHAT?

24:07.133 --> 24:09.067
A CONSENT FORM SO YOU
CAN GET A TATTOO TODAY.

24:09.067 --> 24:10.067
OH, MY GOD.

24:10.067 --> 24:11.933
YOUR PARENTS
WERE IN ON IT, TOO.

24:11.933 --> 24:15.067
-OH, MY GOD.

24:15.067 --> 24:16.900
MY MOM SIGNED THAT?
SHE WAS IN ON IT?

24:16.900 --> 24:19.233
YEP. LOOK.

24:19.233 --> 24:20.800
GIRL. OH, MY GOD.

24:20.800 --> 24:23.067
NO FRICKING WAY.
THANK YOU.

24:23.067 --> 24:25.700
IT'S VERY THOUGHTFUL
FOR VICTORIA TO SET UP

24:25.700 --> 24:27.733
THIS WHOLE TATTOO THING
WITH JAY.

24:27.733 --> 24:30.633
IT SHOWS HOW MUCH SHE CARES,
AND I'M HOPING THAT MAYBE

24:30.633 --> 24:33.333
VICTORIA IS INTERESTED
IN A RELATIONSHIP.

24:33.333 --> 24:35.333
I DID NOT, LIKE,
MENTALLY PREPARE FOR THAT.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.700
I KNOW THAT SHE REALLY
WANTS A TATTOO

24:38.700 --> 24:39.800
AND GETTING YOUR FIRST TATTOO

24:39.800 --> 24:41.467
IS ONE OF THE MOST
SPECIAL THINGS EVER.

24:41.467 --> 24:43.067
AND I THOUGHT, WHY NOT BE
A PART OF THAT?

24:43.067 --> 24:44.867
LIKE, WHY NOT HELP
MAKE THAT HAPPEN?

24:44.867 --> 24:47.067
WHAT SHOULD I GET? SHOULD
I GET A MERMAID, LIKE

24:47.067 --> 24:49.067
YEAH, THAT'S REALLY SYMBOLIC
TO YOU, HONESTLY.

24:49.067 --> 24:49.800
YEAH.

24:49.800 --> 24:51.200
AND IT'S A PART OF YOUR LIFE.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.433
Jazz: I'VE ALWAYS HAD A SPECIAL
CONNECTION TO MERMAIDS.

24:53.433 --> 24:54.900
EVEN SINCE I WAS TWO YEARS OLD,

24:54.900 --> 24:57.067
I ALWAYS HAD A MERMAID DOLL
IN MY HAND

24:57.067 --> 25:01.667
AND I FEEL LIKE THEY REALLY
EMBODY WHO I AM AS A PERSON.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.500
-OH, THAT IS SO PRETTY.
-JAZZ, I LOVE THAT.

25:03.500 --> 25:05.800
-THAT IS AWESOME.
-WOW.

25:05.800 --> 25:08.067
WELL, THIS IS IT.

25:08.067 --> 25:09.300
I LOVE IT.

25:09.300 --> 25:10.567
Jayleen:
IF YOU HAVE SEEN ANYTHING OF HER

25:10.567 --> 25:12.700
WHEN SHE WAS LITTLE,
SHE ALWAYS SAID THAT SHE HAD

25:12.700 --> 25:14.267
A GIRL BRAIN AND A BOY BODY

25:14.267 --> 25:16.067
AND THAT'S WHY THE MERMAID
IS VERY SYMBOLIC,

25:16.067 --> 25:18.500
BECAUSE THE MERMAID DOESN'T
HAVE ANYTHING DOWN THERE.

25:18.500 --> 25:20.433
THAT'S SO CUTE.
I LOVE IT.

25:20.433 --> 25:21.767
I FEEL AMAZING BEING A PART

25:21.767 --> 25:23.333
OF SUCH AN AWESOME SURPRISE
FOR JAZZ,

25:23.333 --> 25:26.500
BECAUSE THIS IS MONUMENTAL.
THIS IS HER FIRST TATTOO.

25:26.500 --> 25:27.867
OKAY, IF YOU NEED
ANYTHING TO HOLD,

25:27.867 --> 25:28.900
I'M RIGHT HERE.

25:28.900 --> 25:29.900
MM-HMM.

25:29.900 --> 25:31.267
WHEN DO YOU TAKE OUT
THE SCALPEL?

25:34.267 --> 25:37.733
STOP IT.
YOU'RE NOT NICE.

25:37.733 --> 25:39.933
VICTORIA, ON A SCALE
OF 1

25:39.933 --> 25:41.067
-10.

25:41.067 --> 25:42.467
NO, FOR REAL, THOUGH.
HOW BAD WAS IT?

25:42.467 --> 25:45.367
-YEP.

25:45.367 --> 25:47.200
JUST TAKE A DEEP BREATH,

25:47.200 --> 25:48.767
AND THEN DON'T LET IT OUT, EVER.

25:50.100 --> 25:52.700
Victoria: ME AND JAZZ
ARE REACHING, LIKE, THE POINT

25:52.700 --> 25:55.133
WHEN WE CAN JOKE AROUND WITH
EACH OTHER AND BE SARCASTIC

25:55.133 --> 25:57.367
AND NONE OF US TAKES IT TO
HEART, WHICH IS REALLY FUN,

25:57.367 --> 25:59.333
BECAUSE I ALWAYS JOKE AROUND.

25:59.333 --> 26:02.533
OKAY.
I'M GOING TO TATTOO YOU.

26:02.533 --> 26:05.333
YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL IT.

26:05.333 --> 26:07.233
YOU'RE GOOD.
YOU GOT THIS.

26:07.233 --> 26:10.167
Jazz: I'M SCARED.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST GO.

26:10.167 --> 26:12.700
READY?
I'M GOING TO GO NOW.

26:15.067 --> 26:18.067
**

26:18.067 --> 26:19.367
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

26:19.367 --> 26:20.833
-KEEP GOING.

26:20.833 --> 26:22.267
CAN YOU FEEL IT?

26:22.267 --> 26:24.067
YEAH, YOU DEFINITELY FEEL IT.

26:24.067 --> 26:27.267
-"YOU DEFINITELY FEEL IT."

26:27.267 --> 26:30.933
THE NEEDLE IS DEFINITELY NOT
THE MOST PLEASANT FEELING.

26:30.933 --> 26:33.667
IT HURTS A LITTLE BIT,
BUT AFTER A WHILE,

26:33.667 --> 26:35.233
I JUST BECOME USED TO IT.

26:35.233 --> 26:37.100
AND WE'RE DONE.

26:37.100 --> 26:38.800
YES!
GUYS, WE'RE DONE!

26:38.800 --> 26:39.633
-WHOO!
-WHOO!

26:39.633 --> 26:40.833
YES!

26:40.833 --> 26:41.967
HELL, YEAH!

26:41.967 --> 26:42.933
YOU WANT TO SEE IT?

26:42.933 --> 26:44.467
YEAH, I WANT TO SEE IT.

26:44.467 --> 26:45.967
OH, MY GOD.

26:45.967 --> 26:48.200
MOMENT OF TRUTH.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.433
EYES CLOSED.

26:50.433 --> 26:53.133
-OH, MY GOD.
-YES!

26:53.133 --> 26:54.900
-THAT IS CRAZY.
-COOL.

26:54.900 --> 26:56.367
-IT LOOKS AMAZING.

26:56.367 --> 26:58.133
YES, WE LOVE IT.

26:58.133 --> 27:00.367
I AM REALLY HAPPY
ABOUT MY NEW TATTOO.

27:00.367 --> 27:02.667
IT IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.

27:02.667 --> 27:05.500
IT'S MY FAVORITE COLORS,
IT'S A MERMAID.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.500
IT'S SIMPLE, BUT IT'S CUTE.

27:07.500 --> 27:11.833
AND I AM JUST EXCITED TO SHOW
EVERYONE IN MY FAMILY MY TATTOO.

27:11.833 --> 27:14.667
BEFORE YOU GUYS LEAVE, UM, DO
YOU GUYS WANT TO COME TO A PARTY

27:14.667 --> 27:16.200
I'M HAVING ON SATURDAY?

27:16.200 --> 27:17.133
-SURE.

27:17.133 --> 27:18.067
-I'M DOWN.
-COOL.

27:18.067 --> 27:19.733
I'LL SEND YOU
ALL THE DETAILS.

27:19.733 --> 27:21.167
IT'S GOING TO BE
A LOT OF FUN.

27:21.167 --> 27:22.500
COOL.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.900
I THINK VICTORIA IS DEFINITELY
TRYING TO GROW CLOSER

27:24.900 --> 27:26.400
BY INVITING ME TO THIS PARTY,

27:26.400 --> 27:28.500
BECAUSE IT'S
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US

27:28.500 --> 27:30.433
TO GET TO KNOW
EACH OTHER EVEN BETTER.

27:30.433 --> 27:32.900
WHILE NOTHING IS SERIOUS
AS OF YET,

27:32.900 --> 27:35.300
IT SEEMS TO BE GOING
IN THAT DIRECTION,

27:35.300 --> 27:36.533
SO I'M EXCITED.

27:36.533 --> 27:38.067
THANKS TO YOU PUTTING
THIS ALL TOGETHER,

27:38.067 --> 27:39.433
COORDINATING IT WITH MY MOM

27:39.433 --> 27:41.267
AND THEN YOU SURPRISING ME
WITH A PRESENT

27:41.267 --> 27:44.433
AND THEN THE BALLOONS,
EVERYTHING WAS JUST SO AMAZING!

27:44.433 --> 27:46.167
SO, I APPRECIATE.
GROUP HUG.

27:46.167 --> 27:48.233
YAY!

27:48.233 --> 27:50.833
-IT'S A REAL TATTOO.

27:50.833 --> 27:52.167
THERE'S SOME AWKWARDNESS
AND TENSION

27:52.167 --> 27:54.833
ABOUT THE FACT
THAT I HAVE A TATTOO.

27:54.833 --> 27:56.667
GRANDPA, ARE YOU OKAY?

27:59.433 --> 28:03.900
**

28:03.900 --> 28:05.933
Jazz: OH, IT'S SUPPOSED
TO RAIN ALL DAY.

28:05.933 --> 28:07.933
Jeanette: OH, GREAT!

28:07.933 --> 28:09.600
GRANDMA'S HAIR
IS GOING TO MELT.

28:09.600 --> 28:12.567
MY MOM AND I ARE DRIVING
TO CLUB MED FOR MY BIRTHDAY.

28:12.567 --> 28:15.667
HOWEVER, THE REAL REASON
WE'RE GOING IS TO SURPRISE HER

28:15.667 --> 28:17.467
WITH A WEDDING VOW RENEWAL.

28:17.467 --> 28:19.367
I CAN'T WAIT TO SURPRISE
SANDER AND GRIFFEN

28:19.367 --> 28:20.900
AND GRANDMA, GRANDPA,
AND ARI WITH MY TATTOO.

28:20.900 --> 28:22.767
YOU KNOW YOUR GRANDPARENTS
ARE GOING TO BE HORRIFIED.

28:22.767 --> 28:25.167
I KNOW. THEY'RE GOING TO
BE REALLY UPSET.

28:25.167 --> 28:27.800
NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY,
AND I'M AFRAID OF GRANDPA

28:27.800 --> 28:30.267
LIKE, LITERALLY HAVING,
LIKE, CHEST PAINS.

28:30.267 --> 28:33.400
I'M SO EXCITED THAT MY MOM
HAS NO IDEA THE REAL REASON

28:33.400 --> 28:34.900
THAT WE'RE GOING TO CLUB MED.

28:35.567 --> 28:36.900
OH. HOW DO I ANSWER?

28:36.900 --> 28:38.067
SEE? PICK IT UP.

28:38.067 --> 28:39.700
WAIT. WHAT?
IT'S MARCI?

28:39.700 --> 28:40.967
MARCI?

28:40.967 --> 28:42.167
HELLO?

28:42.167 --> 28:44.600
BOWERS: Hey, hey.
How are things going?

28:44.600 --> 28:47.400
EVERYTHING'S GOING GOOD.
WE'RE CELEBRATING MY BIRTHDAY.

28:47.400 --> 28:48.633
Happy birthday.

28:48.633 --> 28:49.767
THANK YOU.

28:49.767 --> 28:51.833
WE'RE GETTING A HEALTHY
BIRTHDAY CAKE.

28:51.833 --> 28:54.867
Good. I just thought
I'd say hi and check in.

28:54.867 --> 28:58.367
How much have you lost, Jazz?
Can you give me any idea?

28:58.367 --> 29:02.700
UM, I'VE LOST 2 MORE POUNDS,
SO I'M AT AROUND 12 POUNDS NOW.

29:02.700 --> 29:04.167
Okay, that's really encouraging,

29:04.167 --> 29:06.100
because I've got about
eight different ways

29:06.100 --> 29:07.533
where I would not
do the surgery,

29:07.533 --> 29:11.500
so you have to thread
the needle here.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.900
But I got an e-mail
from Dr. Volker

29:13.900 --> 29:16.733
and apparently,
that's going well, also.

29:16.733 --> 29:17.767
AWESOME.

29:17.767 --> 29:19.567
So, I think I'm
encouraged enough

29:19.567 --> 29:22.733
that I think we should probably
put a date on the calendar.

29:22.733 --> 29:23.833
-YAY!
-YAY!

29:23.833 --> 29:25.433
-THAT'S AWESOME.

29:25.433 --> 29:26.633
YES! SO EXCITING.

29:26.633 --> 29:27.733
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO SAY,

29:27.733 --> 29:29.433
"I CAN'T DO
THE SURGERY FOR YOU."

29:29.433 --> 29:32.233
SHE LOOKED A LITTLE GREEN.
I'M LIKE, WHERE ARE YOU, JAZZ?

29:32.233 --> 29:33.700
YOU'RE NOT WITH ME.

29:33.700 --> 29:35.267
Here's the date
I have in my mind,

29:35.267 --> 29:36.733
and that is June 20th.

29:36.733 --> 29:37.767
How does that sound?

29:37.767 --> 29:39.767
THAT SOUNDS
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.

29:39.767 --> 29:41.067
YES, BEGINNING OF SUMMER.

29:41.067 --> 29:43.067
JUNE 20th. THAT --

29:43.067 --> 29:44.133
OH, YAY!

29:44.133 --> 29:46.133
I REALLY WASN'T EXPECTING
IT TO BE IN JUNE,

29:46.133 --> 29:49.367
BUT NOW THAT YOU SAID JUNE,
THAT MAKES ME SUPER-HAPPY.

29:49.367 --> 29:50.200
YAY. I COULD CRY.

29:50.200 --> 29:50.867
Yay!

29:50.867 --> 29:52.267
TEARS IN MOM'S EYES.

29:52.267 --> 29:53.633
Jeanette:
I'M SO HAPPY FOR JAZZ.

29:53.633 --> 29:55.600
IT'S HER BIRTHDAY, AND THIS
IS SOMETHING WONDERFUL

29:55.600 --> 29:57.133
TO CELEBRATE.

29:57.133 --> 29:58.833
SHE'S WORKED HARD,
SHE'S LOST SOME WEIGHT,

29:58.833 --> 30:04.200
AND WE'RE ON THE PATH
TO THE VAGINOPLASTY.

30:04.200 --> 30:05.967
BOWERS: Okay, don't forget,
this is just penciled in.

30:05.967 --> 30:07.533
This isn't written in stone.

30:07.533 --> 30:10.400
So, we're going to be checking
in on your progress as we go,

30:10.400 --> 30:11.900
Because I'm telling you,

30:11.900 --> 30:13.967
if you're one pound off,
we're not doing this.

30:13.967 --> 30:16.367
I'M HOPING TO LOSE
MORE THAN 30 POUNDS

30:16.367 --> 30:19.333
BY THE MARCH/APRIL DEADLINE
TO LOSE THAT WEIGHT.

30:19.333 --> 30:21.900
Jazz: HAVING THIS DATE IS ONE
OF THE BEST BIRTHDAY PRESENTS

30:21.900 --> 30:23.000
I COULD ASK FOR.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.967
AND IT'S REALLY UP
TO ME TO PROVE

30:24.967 --> 30:26.667
THAT I'M SERIOUS ABOUT THIS,

30:26.667 --> 30:28.100
I'M GOING TO MAKE PROGRESS,

30:28.100 --> 30:30.733
BECAUSE I WOULD JUST BE
ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED

30:30.733 --> 30:33.133
IF DR. BOWERS SAID
THAT SHE NEEDS TO RESCHEDULE

30:33.133 --> 30:34.467
THE SURGERY FOR A LATER DATE,

30:34.467 --> 30:36.900
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T REACHED
MY TARGET GOAL WEIGHT.

30:36.900 --> 30:38.500
I'm super-excited for you,
Jazz,

30:38.500 --> 30:40.333
and I'm super-excited
for your surgery.

30:40.333 --> 30:41.600
And I look forward
to seeing you soon.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.500
THANK YOU, MARCI.
YOU'RE THE BEST.

30:43.500 --> 30:45.000
-THANK YOU.
-Okay. You, too.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.100
All right, bye, everyone.

30:46.100 --> 30:47.333
BYE! YOU HAPPY?

30:47.333 --> 30:49.133
JUNE 20th, JUNE 20th.

30:49.133 --> 30:52.267
OH, MY GOD. THIS IS LIKE
THE BEST BIRTHDAY EVER!

30:52.267 --> 30:54.067
I CAN'T WAIT
TO TELL THE FAMILY.

30:54.067 --> 30:55.633
-* YES *
-OH, MY GOD!

30:55.633 --> 30:56.800
WHOO!

30:56.800 --> 30:58.900
IF I WASN'T DRIVING,
I'D BE CRYING.

30:58.900 --> 31:02.900
**

31:02.900 --> 31:06.833
**

31:06.833 --> 31:09.200
-WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DAY.
-UH, WELL, BOTH OF YOU

31:09.200 --> 31:10.200
LOOK VERY HANDSOME TODAY.

31:10.200 --> 31:12.567
-HEY!
-HEY!

31:12.567 --> 31:14.533
IT'S MY BEST YOUNG MEN.
YOU GUYS READY?

31:14.533 --> 31:15.967
-YEAH, YEAH.
-ALL RIGHT.

31:15.967 --> 31:17.400
MASTER OF CEREMONIES?

31:17.400 --> 31:18.667
THEY MAY BE
YOUR BEST YOUNG MEN,

31:18.667 --> 31:19.933
BUT YOU'RE STILL
PUT THEM TO SHAME.

31:19.933 --> 31:21.333
YOU'RE STILL
A GOOD-LOOKING GUY.

31:21.333 --> 31:24.700
Greg: BEING ROMANTIC IS A LITTLE
BIT OUT OF CHARACTER FOR ME,

31:24.700 --> 31:27.667
SO I THINK JEANETTE
WILL BE PRETTY SURPRISED,

31:27.667 --> 31:31.567
AND HOPEFULLY, IT'LL BE
ONE OF THE MOST MEMORABLE EVENTS

31:31.567 --> 31:32.367
IN HER LIFE.

31:32.367 --> 31:33.900
DID YOU BRING ANY HANDKERCHIEFS

31:33.900 --> 31:35.067
THAT YOU CAN GIVE
TO YOUR MOM?

31:35.067 --> 31:36.233
I DIDN'T BRING ONE.

31:36.233 --> 31:37.600
SHE'S GOING TO BE CRYING
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

31:37.600 --> 31:38.900
GRIFFEN COULD GIVE UP
THIS ONE.

31:38.900 --> 31:40.067
I'LL GIVE HER THIS.

31:40.067 --> 31:41.133
I THINK I'M GOING TO NEED
A HANDKERCHIEF, TOO.

31:41.133 --> 31:42.267
I MIGHT SHED A FEW TEARS.

31:42.267 --> 31:44.900
I'M VERY ANXIOUS FOR THIS
VOW RENEWAL TO START.

31:44.900 --> 31:46.700
I'M EXCITED TO SEE MY MOM
WHEN SHE COMES OUT.

31:46.700 --> 31:48.500
I THINK SHE'S GOING TO LOOK
BEAUTIFUL, AS ALWAYS.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.867
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE
A VERY EMOTIONAL, SWEET,

31:50.867 --> 31:53.467
AND AWESOME AND BONDING
EXPERIENCE FOR MY FAMILY

31:53.467 --> 31:54.933
FOR THIS VOW RENEWAL
TO TAKE PLACE.

31:54.933 --> 31:56.333
IT'S GOING TO BE SUPER-EXCITING.

31:56.333 --> 31:59.300
LOOK WHO'S HERE!

31:59.300 --> 32:01.100
HI. LOOK AT YOU.

32:01.100 --> 32:02.700
-HEY.
-SO TALL.

32:02.700 --> 32:05.367
Jacky: JEANETTE IS SUCH A DOER
AND A GIVER AND A CARETAKER,

32:05.367 --> 32:08.767
NOT A RECEIVER THAT MUCH,
SO THIS SHOULD BE GRAND.

32:08.767 --> 32:10.167
WHERE IS EVERYONE?

32:10.167 --> 32:13.067
UH, I THINK THEY MAY BE
IN THE GYM OR OUT CHECKING

32:13.067 --> 32:15.867
THE SCENERY AND, UH, BUSY.

32:15.867 --> 32:17.067
THEY'RE OUT AND ABOUT.

32:17.067 --> 32:18.667
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
DO WE CHECK

32:18.667 --> 32:20.233
UH, THE ROOM IS ALL SET.

32:20.233 --> 32:21.667
Jazz:
I'M GETTING A LITTLE ANXIOUS.

32:21.667 --> 32:23.067
I DON'T GO TO
THE FRONT DESK?

32:23.067 --> 32:24.233
NO, WE GOT YOU.

32:24.233 --> 32:27.133
'CAUSE MOM IS VERY NOSY.

32:27.133 --> 32:29.967
-STILL RAINING.
-WATCH OUT FOR PUDDLES.

32:29.967 --> 32:33.500
BUT I KNOW SHE'S
GOING TO LOVE THIS.

32:33.500 --> 32:35.133
Jeanette:
* FUN, FUN, FUN *

32:35.133 --> 32:38.567
WOW.
IT'S SO PRETTY.

32:38.567 --> 32:40.400
YES, DOES THIS LOOK FAMILIAR,
JEANETTE?

32:40.400 --> 32:41.700
IT'S SO PRETTY.

32:43.667 --> 32:45.267
THAT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING
YOU WOULD WEAR.

32:45.267 --> 32:47.500
-THERE'S A LITTLE NOTE.
-READ IT.

32:47.500 --> 32:51.067
Jacky: "MEET ME AT
THE SOLEIL TERRACE AT 4:00 P.M.

32:51.067 --> 32:52.800
TO RENEW YOUR WEDDING VOWS."

32:52.800 --> 32:56.067
!
-YES! YES!

32:56.067 --> 32:57.100
-AAH!
-AAH!

33:00.167 --> 33:03.333
**

33:03.333 --> 33:05.467
-THERE'S A LITTLE NOTE.

33:05.467 --> 33:09.100
Jacky: "MEET ME AT
THE SOLEIL TERRACE AT 4:00 P.M.

33:09.100 --> 33:11.067
TO RENEW YOUR WEDDING VOWS."

33:11.067 --> 33:13.767
!
-YES! YES!

33:13.767 --> 33:14.867
-AAH!
-AAH!

33:14.867 --> 33:16.967
SURPRISE!

33:16.967 --> 33:18.933
LOOK AT YOUR DRESS!

33:18.933 --> 33:22.667
WHEN I READ THE NOTE ABOUT
THE VOW RENEWAL, I JUST MELT.

33:22.667 --> 33:26.067
I'M, LIKE -- I'M SO MUSHY
AND NOSTALGIC

33:26.067 --> 33:30.500
AND I AM A ROMANTIC PERSON,
AND I JUST FELT GOOD ALL OVER.

33:30.500 --> 33:31.700
I'M TINGLING.

33:31.700 --> 33:33.467
SAY YES TO THE DRESS,
JEANETTE?

33:33.467 --> 33:38.067
YES! I SAY YES TO THIS DRESS,
BUT I HAVEN'T TRIED IT ON YET.

33:38.067 --> 33:40.233
I DEFINITELY THINK THIS IS
THE BEST SURPRISE

33:40.233 --> 33:41.967
WE'VE EVER PULLED
OFF FOR MY MOM.

33:41.967 --> 33:44.200
I'M SPEECHLESS.
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN A DREAM.

33:44.200 --> 33:47.233
WE HAVE DONE SOME THINGS
IN THE PAST FOR MOTHER'S DAY

33:47.233 --> 33:49.233
OR HER BIRTHDAY, HOWEVER,

33:49.233 --> 33:52.567
THIS IS JUST SOMETHING
SO BIG AND SO MEANINGFUL,

33:52.567 --> 33:55.567
BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN WANTING
TO DO IT FOR A LONG TIME.

33:55.567 --> 33:57.167
WE PULLED IT OFF.
WE DID IT.

33:57.167 --> 33:59.300
SHE WAS SO SURPRISED.
OH, MY GOD.

33:59.300 --> 34:00.933
DID YOU SEE HER FACE?
SHE WAS LIKE --

34:00.933 --> 34:02.633
-SHE WAS LIKE --
-SHE GOT ROSY --

34:02.633 --> 34:04.867
SHE ACTED LIKE
SHE WAS IN A DREAM.

34:04.867 --> 34:08.067
Jacky: IT IS SO OVER-THE-TOP
EXCITING TO DO THIS.

34:08.067 --> 34:10.067
THIS REALLY SURPRISED HER

34:10.067 --> 34:12.433
AND I'M EXCITED TO
SEE IT ALL HAPPENING.

34:14.733 --> 34:17.867
**

34:17.867 --> 34:21.067
**

34:21.067 --> 34:23.267
-AH!
-IT'S SO CUTE!

34:23.267 --> 34:26.700
THERE SHE IS,
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

34:26.700 --> 34:28.533
LOOK AT DAD'S EYES.
HE CAN'T EVEN OPEN THEM,

34:28.533 --> 34:30.333
HE'S LIKE,
BLUSHING TOO MUCH.

34:30.333 --> 34:33.467
Jazz: MY DAD IS GLOWING
AS HE LOOKS AT MY MOM,

34:33.467 --> 34:36.100
AND YOU COULD JUST SEE
THE LOVE IN HIS EYES.

34:36.100 --> 34:38.533
AND IT'S JUST SO AMAZING
THAT MY PARENTS

34:38.533 --> 34:40.267
HAVE SUCH A STRONG CONNECTION

34:40.267 --> 34:42.433
AND THAT THEY TRULY
ARE SOUL MATES.

34:42.433 --> 34:43.700
-YES.

34:43.700 --> 34:44.767
OKAY.

34:44.767 --> 34:45.600
MWAH!

34:45.600 --> 34:46.533
Jeanette: I THINK IT'S SO CUTE

34:46.533 --> 34:47.567
THAT MY DAD IS OFFICIATING.

34:47.567 --> 34:49.067
HE'S TAKING IT VERY SERIOUSLY.

34:49.067 --> 34:50.800
HE HAS HIS LITTLE
NOTES WITH HIM.

34:50.800 --> 34:54.133
AND, UM, I THINK THIS IS
A REAL TREAT FOR HIM.

34:54.133 --> 34:55.900
UH, JEANETTE AND GREG,

34:55.900 --> 34:58.500
WHEN YOU FIRST JOINED HANDS
AND HEARTS IN MARRIAGE

34:58.500 --> 35:03.400
24 YEARS AGO, YOU DID NOT KNOW
WHERE YOUR LIFE WOULD TAKE YOU.

35:03.400 --> 35:06.867
LIFE HAS SURELY BROUGHT YOU
BOTH WONDERFUL BLESSINGS

35:06.867 --> 35:09.300
AND DIFFICULT CHALLENGES
OVER THE YEARS.

35:09.300 --> 35:13.600
GREG, WILL YOU CONTINUE TO HAVE
JEANETTE AS YOUR WIFE

35:13.600 --> 35:16.600
AND CONTINUE TO LIVE IN
THIS HAPPY AND LOVING MARRIAGE?

35:16.600 --> 35:18.067
I WILL.

35:18.067 --> 35:20.500
JEANETTE, WILL YOU CONTINUE
TO HAVE GREG AS YOUR HUSBAND

35:20.500 --> 35:23.200
AND CONTINUE TO LIVE IN THIS
HAPPY AND LOVING MARRIAGE?

35:23.200 --> 35:25.167
I SURE WILL!

35:25.167 --> 35:28.733
UH, NOW, I BELIEVE
THE TWO OF YOU HAVE

35:28.733 --> 35:31.500
SOMETHING YOU WANT TO SAY.

35:31.500 --> 35:33.967
YOU REMEMBER 24 YEARS AGO,
UH,

35:33.967 --> 35:35.067
YOU DID HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY?

35:35.067 --> 35:37.567
WE WROTE OUR OWN VOWS.

35:37.567 --> 35:40.333
I HAVE THEM
PRINTED UP NICELY.

35:40.333 --> 35:41.500
WHERE'D YOU GET THESE FROM?

35:41.500 --> 35:44.433
I TRANSCRIBED IT
FROM THE VIDEO.

35:44.433 --> 35:45.867
AWW!

35:45.867 --> 35:47.333
SO, WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO FIRST
LIKE WE DID AT THE WEDDING?

35:47.333 --> 35:49.433
SURE.

35:49.433 --> 35:51.633
MY DEAREST GREG,
AS YOU LOOK UPON ME NOW,

35:51.633 --> 35:52.767
MY STOMACH IS FLUTTERING

35:52.767 --> 35:54.667
AND MY HEART SKIPS A BEAT,

35:54.667 --> 35:56.733
JUST KNOWING THAT I WILL
SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE

35:56.733 --> 35:59.600
WITH SOMEONE AS WONDERFUL
AND SPECIAL AS YOU ARE.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.600
I LOVE YOU MORE THAN
I THOUGHT WAS EVER POSSIBLE

36:01.600 --> 36:03.933
TO LOVE ANOTHER.

36:03.933 --> 36:05.967
I PROMISE TO NURTURE
AND PROTECT OUR LOVE

36:05.967 --> 36:08.767
FOR ALL THE DAYS
OF MY LIFE AND BEYOND.

36:08.767 --> 36:10.733
I WANT TO SHARE
EVERYTHING WITH YOU,

36:10.733 --> 36:12.467
I WANT TO SHARE YOUR LAUGHTER
WHEN YOU'RE HAPPY,

36:12.467 --> 36:14.933
I WANT TO CRY YOUR TEARS
WHEN YOU'RE SAD,

36:14.933 --> 36:16.800
I WANT TO CELEBRATE
WHEN YOU'RE TRIUMPHANT,

36:16.800 --> 36:18.667
AND I WANT TO FEEL YOUR PAIN
WHEN YOU ARE HURT,

36:18.667 --> 36:20.233
BECAUSE YOU AND I
ARE SOUL MATES.

36:20.233 --> 36:23.067
YOU ARE HALF OF ALL I AM,
AND I TRULY BELIEVE THAT.

36:23.067 --> 36:25.067
THE FUTURE IS OURS,
ALWAYS.

36:25.067 --> 36:27.067
YAY! I GOT THROUGH IT
WITHOUT CRYING.

36:30.067 --> 36:32.800
Jacky: IT TAKES ME BACK
TO THE DAY THEY GOT MARRIED.

36:32.800 --> 36:34.667
IT IS LIKE YESTERDAY.

36:34.667 --> 36:37.067
I REMEMBER SO MANY
OF THE DETAILS.

36:37.067 --> 36:39.967
Jack: IF THERE WAS
ANY TWO SOUL MATES TOGETHER

36:39.967 --> 36:42.900
THAT WAS MEANT TO BE,
IT'S GREG AND JEANETTE.

36:42.900 --> 36:44.767
I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT.

36:44.767 --> 36:48.433
IT WAS A SPECIAL MOMENT
TO BE ABLE TO OFFICIATE IT.

36:48.433 --> 36:51.600
JEANETTE, THIS IS
THE HAPPIEST DAY OF MY LIFE,

36:51.600 --> 36:55.167
BECAUSE TODAY,
BEFORE OUR FAMILY,

36:55.167 --> 36:57.367
I DECLARE MY LOVE FOR YOU

36:57.367 --> 37:01.233
AND KNOWING THAT YOU WILL BE
MY WIFE FILLS MY HEART WITH JOY,

37:01.233 --> 37:04.067
FOR I KNOW WE WERE
MEANT TO BE TOGETHER.

37:04.067 --> 37:07.700
JEANETTE, MY GREATEST WISH
IS TO GIVE YOU ALL THE LOVE

37:07.700 --> 37:09.433
YOU COULD EVER NEED,

37:09.433 --> 37:11.967
TO CHERISH YOU ABOVE
ALL OTHERS,

37:11.967 --> 37:15.533
TO PLAN WITH YOU,
TO DREAM WITH YOU,

37:15.533 --> 37:17.667
AND TO RESPECT YOU
AND REMIND YOU

37:17.667 --> 37:19.900
THAT YOU ARE
THE ONE I LOVE,

37:19.900 --> 37:24.567
FOR YOU ARE MY WORLD,
MY HEART, MY LIFE.

37:24.567 --> 37:26.800
JEANETTE,
I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU.

37:26.800 --> 37:30.067
Jeanette: HAVING A MOMENT IN
TIME WHERE WE CAN RELIVE

37:30.067 --> 37:32.067
OUR WEDDING VOWS TO EACH OTHER

37:32.067 --> 37:33.933
AND SEE OUR BEAUTIFUL FAMILY

37:33.933 --> 37:37.067
AND ALL THE LOVE AROUND US
AT THE SAME TIME,

37:37.067 --> 37:38.767
IT WAS A WONDERFUL DAY.

37:38.767 --> 37:42.133
UH, THE BRIDE AND GROOM
REAFFIRMED MAY KISS.

37:42.133 --> 37:44.333
-ALL RIGHT!
-EWW!

37:44.333 --> 37:47.333
-NO, MAKE-OUT!

37:47.333 --> 37:49.233
-WAIT A MINUTE!
-WHOO!

37:49.233 --> 37:52.700
-THAT WAS VERY SEXY.

37:56.467 --> 38:01.100
**

38:01.100 --> 38:05.700
**

38:05.700 --> 38:07.933
HOW YOU FEELING?
HOW WAS THAT?

38:07.933 --> 38:10.333
MY BREATH WAS TAKEN AWAY
WHEN I SAW THE DRESS.

38:10.333 --> 38:11.633
DID YOU ENJOY THE CEREMONY?

38:11.633 --> 38:12.833
I ENJOYED EVERYTHING.

38:12.833 --> 38:14.800
I LOVE YOU,
AND IT WAS WONDERFUL.

38:14.800 --> 38:17.633
I GOT ONE MORE SURPRISE.
DON'T LOOK YET.

38:17.633 --> 38:18.900
Griffen:
WE GOT A MALE STRIPPER!

38:18.900 --> 38:20.100
-YOU COULD LOOK NOW.

38:20.100 --> 38:21.900
-OH, WOW. YES.
-AWW!

38:21.900 --> 38:23.267
FROM OUR HONEYMOON.

38:23.267 --> 38:25.067
-THAT'S OUR HONEYMOON SHIRT.
-I STILL HAVE THE SHIRT.

38:25.067 --> 38:26.433
OOH, AND HE'S GOT
A SIX-PACK STILL.

38:26.433 --> 38:30.133
GREG IS LIKE SUPERMAN
AND RIPS OPEN THE SHIRT,

38:30.133 --> 38:32.200
AND IT WAS
OUR HONEYMOON T-SHIRT.

38:32.200 --> 38:35.067
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,
THE T-SHIRT WAS JEANETTE'S IDEA.

38:35.067 --> 38:36.367
I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE
CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA,

38:36.367 --> 38:37.733
BUT SHE THOUGHT
THAT IF WE WORE...

38:37.733 --> 38:39.467
THERE WAS NO INTERNET,
SO IT WASN'T FROM THE INTERNET.

38:39.467 --> 38:41.067
...A T-SHIRT THAT HAD
A PICTURE OF US, THAT SAID,

38:41.067 --> 38:44.300
"JUST MARRIED,"
THAT THEY WOULD UPGRADE US

38:44.300 --> 38:47.267
WHEN WE WERE ON THE PLANE.

38:47.267 --> 38:49.933
THE WHOLE TRICK OF GETTING MOM
HERE AND SURPRISING HER WAS,

38:49.933 --> 38:53.867
WE WERE COMING UP HERE TO
CELEBRATE JAZZ'S 17th BIRTHDAY.

38:53.867 --> 38:55.600
SO, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JAZZ.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.300
-THANK YOU.
-AND MANY, MANY MORE.

38:57.300 --> 39:00.067
-HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JAZZ.
-HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

39:00.067 --> 39:02.900
YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY
FEEL A LITTLE BIT OLDER.

39:04.300 --> 39:08.867
I FEEL LIKE THIS PAST YEAR
I'VE REALLY BEEN LEARNING

39:08.867 --> 39:11.067
MORE ABOUT MYSELF
AND WHO I AM

39:11.067 --> 39:13.933
AND I'M MAKING NEW
AND BIG CHANGES IN MY LIFE.

39:13.933 --> 39:15.800
YOU KNOW, I STARTED
VIRTUAL SCHOOL,

39:15.800 --> 39:18.167
I DYED MY HAIR
A FEW MONTHS AGO,

39:18.167 --> 39:22.967
AND I ENDED UP
GETTING A TATTOO.

39:22.967 --> 39:25.633
-IT'S A REAL TATTOO.

39:25.633 --> 39:29.167
**

39:29.167 --> 39:31.633
I DON'T REMEMBER
SIGNING THE CONSENT FORM.

39:31.633 --> 39:35.700
I DID. WE BOTH DECIDED AS
PARENTS THAT IT WOULD BE OKAY.

39:35.700 --> 39:38.167
LET HER GO THROUGH IT, IF THAT'S
WHAT SHE REALLY WANTS TO DO.

39:38.167 --> 39:39.733
IT HAS TO BE NOT VISIBLE.

39:39.733 --> 39:41.200
IT DIDN'T REQUIRE
TWO SIGNATURES.

39:41.200 --> 39:42.133
I SEE.

39:42.133 --> 39:43.367
I THINK THERE WAS SOMETHING

39:43.367 --> 39:46.300
IN THE COMMUNICATION
THAT I MISUNDERSTOOD.

39:46.300 --> 39:48.667
-IT'S A MERMAID. THAT'S SO COOL.

39:48.667 --> 39:51.100
-OH, POOR GRANDPA.

39:51.100 --> 39:53.400
GRANDPA, ARE YOU OKAY?

39:53.400 --> 39:56.467
I THINK I SUNK A LITTLE BIT
WHEN I SAW THAT BIG TATTOO.

39:56.467 --> 39:58.500
I GUESS IT STATES MY AGE,
IN A WAY.

39:58.500 --> 40:00.100
AND I'D HATE TO
TELL THIS TO JAZZ.

40:00.100 --> 40:01.733
I JUST DIDN'T LIKE
HER TATTOO.

40:01.733 --> 40:04.833
I DIDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE THAT
IT WAS A MERMAID RIGHT AWAY.

40:04.833 --> 40:06.167
WHEN DID YOU GET THE TATTOO?

40:06.167 --> 40:07.867
LIKE, RECENTLY.

40:07.867 --> 40:10.800
Sander: I'M GOING TO
BE HONEST, I DON'T 100%
AGREE WITH THE TATTOO.

40:10.800 --> 40:12.733
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHY MY PARENTS SIGNED OFF

40:12.733 --> 40:13.967
ON THE TATTOO.

40:13.967 --> 40:15.833
I'M NOT THAT SURPRISED
THAT MY MOM ALLOWED JAZZ

40:15.833 --> 40:17.667
TO GET A TATTOO,
BUT MY DAD, ON THE OTHER HAND,

40:17.667 --> 40:21.267
I THINK IF IT WAS ME, SANDER,
OR ARI, FOUR OR FIVE YEARS AGO,

40:21.267 --> 40:22.833
I DON'T THINK HE WOULD'VE
LET US GET A TATTOO.

40:22.833 --> 40:25.233
BUT JAZZ GETS
WHAT JAZZ WANTS.

40:25.233 --> 40:27.067
CAN I ASK YOU,
HOW DID YOU GET A TATTOO

40:27.067 --> 40:28.400
WITHOUT PARENTAL
PERMISSION?

40:28.400 --> 40:31.067
I DID. MOM -- I TALKED TO
MOM AND DAD, THEY AGREED.

40:31.067 --> 40:32.467
MOM SIGNED.

40:32.467 --> 40:35.367
GREG, WERE YOU TALKED INTO IT,
OR YOU JUST REALLY AGREED?

40:35.367 --> 40:38.267
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
SHE ACTUALLY WAS GETTING IT.

40:39.567 --> 40:41.433
SO, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'M SEEING IT, AS WELL.

40:41.433 --> 40:43.267
IF THEY LET ME, I WOULD
LIKE TO GET ANOTHER ONE.

40:43.267 --> 40:46.233
-YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANY MORE.
-OKAY. UNTIL I'M 18.

40:46.233 --> 40:49.267
NOT UNTIL YOU COULD SIGN
YOUR OWN CONSENT.

40:49.267 --> 40:51.733
Jazz: I CAN DEFINITELY TELL
THAT THERE'S SOME AWKWARDNESS

40:51.733 --> 40:55.033
AND TENSION ABOUT THE FACT
THAT I HAVE A TATTOO.

40:55.033 --> 40:58.900
BUT THEN THEY BRING OUT
THIS BIRTHDAY CAKE.

40:58.900 --> 41:01.433
-YAY!
-YAY!

41:01.433 --> 41:02.933
SHOULD I TAKE THESE
OFF FIRST?

41:02.933 --> 41:04.400
GIVE SANDER A NACHO.

41:04.400 --> 41:06.867
Jazz: MY CAKE LOOKS
ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.

41:06.867 --> 41:09.733
IT IS MY BIRTHDAY, AND I'M GOING
TO ALLOW MYSELF TO EAT SOME.

41:09.733 --> 41:13.433
I JUST CAN'T HAVE MULTIPLE
PIECES LIKE I WOULD IN THE PAST.

41:13.433 --> 41:17.867
-JAZZ HAS ANOTHER ANNOUNCEMENT.
ANOTHER ANNOUNCEMENT?

41:17.867 --> 41:20.967
-TODAY,

41:20.967 --> 41:23.600
WHILE WE WERE DRIVING UP HERE,

41:23.600 --> 41:25.233
MARCI CALLED US

41:25.233 --> 41:28.433
AND WE BOOKED A DATE
FOR MY SURGERY!

41:28.433 --> 41:30.600
-YAY!
-WHOO!

41:30.600 --> 41:32.133
JUNE 20th!

41:32.133 --> 41:35.833
-WE'RE GOING TO NEW YORK!

41:35.833 --> 41:38.733
I'M VERY SURPRISED,
BECAUSE I WASN'T PART

41:38.733 --> 41:41.067
OF THAT CONVERSATION,
AS TO WHEN THE ACTUAL DATE

41:41.067 --> 41:42.100
WAS GOING TO BE SET.

41:42.100 --> 41:43.533
WHEN THERE'S BIG NEWS
IN THE FAMILY,

41:43.533 --> 41:45.400
I CERTAINLY DON'T
WANT TO BE THE LAST

41:45.400 --> 41:48.933
TO HEAR SOME OF THESE THINGS,
LIKE TATTOOS AND SURGICAL DATES,

41:48.933 --> 41:52.167
THEY'RE IMPORTANT THINGS THAT
I WANT TO BE PARTICIPATING IN.

41:52.167 --> 41:53.733
SO, WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

41:53.733 --> 41:55.333
Sander:
I'M EXCITED FOR YOU, JAZZ.

41:55.333 --> 41:57.800
Jeanette: GREG IS NOT LOOKING
TOO THRILLED, AND I REALIZE,

41:57.800 --> 42:00.867
OH, IT WAS SOMEWHAT
DISRESPECTFUL

42:00.867 --> 42:03.067
NOT TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT

42:03.067 --> 42:05.533
BEFORE JAZZ ANNOUNCED IT.

42:05.533 --> 42:08.667
MARCI MADE IT CLEAR THAT
IF I AM 29 POUNDS DOWN,

42:08.667 --> 42:11.533
NOT 30, THAT I CAN'T
GET THE SURGERY.

42:11.533 --> 42:13.133
IT HAS TO BE 30 POUNDS.

42:13.133 --> 42:14.633
THERE'S NO --
THERE'S NOBODY THAT COULD

42:14.633 --> 42:15.900
STOP YOU BUT YOURSELF.

42:15.900 --> 42:17.333
AND YOU WANT THIS SO BAD,

42:17.333 --> 42:20.767
SO LOSE THE WEIGHT, AND WE'LL
BE READY FOR THAT SURGERY.

42:20.767 --> 42:22.533
WE'LL ALL BE THERE
PULLING FOR YOU.

42:22.533 --> 42:24.167
WE WANT WHAT YOU WANT.

42:24.167 --> 42:27.167
I'M EXCITED FOR YOUR SURGERY
AND I'M HAPPY THAT YOU'RE HAPPY.

42:27.167 --> 42:29.567
THANK YOU, GRANDPA.
I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

42:29.567 --> 42:32.967
JAZZ HAS A DATE FOR SURGERY,
AND WE WILL ROLL WITH IT,

42:32.967 --> 42:34.567
AS WE HAVE ROLLED THROUGH

42:34.567 --> 42:36.700
ALL THESE MANY THINGS
THAT HAVE GONE ON.

42:36.700 --> 42:39.167
BUT THIS IS THE PART OF JAZZ
THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH NOW,

42:39.167 --> 42:40.733
THE HEALTH, THE WEIGHT,
AND ALL OF THAT,

42:40.733 --> 42:43.200
TO GET HER TO THE SURGERY,

42:43.200 --> 42:48.067
TO GIVE HER A SHOT AT AS MUCH
OF THE LIFE THAT SHE WANTS.

42:48.067 --> 42:50.867
HEY, JAZZ?
IT'S BEEN A LONG JOURNEY.

42:50.867 --> 42:53.067
I KNOW YOUR FAMILY'S
HAPPY FOR YOU,

42:53.067 --> 42:56.233
AND HERE'S TO THE NEXT
STEP IN LIFE.

42:56.233 --> 42:57.267
CHEERS.

42:57.267 --> 42:59.200
SINCE JAZZ IS UNDER
THE AGE OF 18,

42:59.200 --> 43:02.600
IT REQUIRES BOTH PARENTS'
CONSENT,

43:02.600 --> 43:05.500
SO BEFORE I SIGN OFF
ON JAZZ HAVING SURGERY,

43:05.500 --> 43:09.267
I WANT TO SEE WHETHER SHE
CONTINUES TO SHOW COMMITMENT

43:09.267 --> 43:12.467
TO HER EDUCATION, CONTINUES
TO TAKE CARE OF HERSELF

43:12.467 --> 43:14.300
AND DO WHAT
THE DOCTORS HAVE SAID.

43:14.300 --> 43:16.500
I'LL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT HER.

43:16.500 --> 43:18.900
BUT IF I FEEL LIKE
SHE'S BACKTRACKING,

43:18.900 --> 43:20.500
THEN WE'LL PUSH IT BACK.

43:20.500 --> 43:24.567
REALLY, I'M GLAD TO BE 17,
I'M GLAD TO BE GROWING UP,

43:24.567 --> 43:28.600
BUT I'M FOREVER GOING TO
CHERISH THIS CURRENT AGE

43:28.600 --> 43:30.967
AND TIME IN MY LIFE
AND THIS MOMENT

43:30.967 --> 43:32.867
BEING HERE WITH ALL OF YOU.

43:32.867 --> 43:35.067
AND I LOVE YOU ALL.

43:35.067 --> 43:37.067
-CHEERS!
-CHEERS!

43:38.800 --> 43:43.700
**

43:43.700 --> 43:48.600
**

43:48.600 --> 43:50.500
HAVING THE DATE OF JUNE 20th

43:50.500 --> 43:53.200
HAS REALLY GIVEN ME
A NEW SENSE OF MOTIVATION.

43:53.200 --> 43:56.233
SINCE MY BIRTHDAY,
I HAVE LOST 6 POUNDS

43:56.233 --> 44:00.733
AND NOW I AM 18 POUNDS DOWN,
AND I'M PRETTY PROUD OF MYSELF,

44:00.733 --> 44:03.700
BECAUSE IT'S DEFINITELY
BEEN A CONSTANT BATTLE

44:03.700 --> 44:05.867
BETWEEN GAINING
AND LOSING WEIGHT.

44:05.867 --> 44:10.233
**

44:10.233 --> 44:11.867
AY-YI-YI.

44:11.867 --> 44:15.133
Greg: WE'VE BEEN DOWN
A PRETTY BUMPY ROAD.

44:15.133 --> 44:19.067
JAZZ, WHAT IS THIS?!
THIS IS ALL LIKE, TAKE-OUT FOOD.

44:19.067 --> 44:20.733
WE'RE REALLY PROUD OF JAZZ,

44:20.733 --> 44:22.967
WITH THE PROGRESS THAT SHE'S
MAKING WITH THE WEIGHT LOSS.

44:22.967 --> 44:25.900
BUT I CANNOT SAY WITH
100% CERTAINTY

44:25.900 --> 44:29.200
THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO
LOOK BACK IN A YEAR AND SAY

44:29.200 --> 44:31.800
IT'S ALL FINISHED.

44:31.800 --> 44:34.133
**

44:34.133 --> 44:37.233
I KNOW THAT THE SURGERY DATE
IS NOT SET IN STONE,

44:37.233 --> 44:39.533
SO IT'S REALLY UP TO ME
TO STAY ON TRACK,

44:39.533 --> 44:43.633
OTHERWISE, EVERYTHING I'VE HOPED
FOR ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN.

44:43.633 --> 44:44.067
**
