01:53.847 --> 01:58.307
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes

01:58.985 --> 02:04.218
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Moments so dear

02:04.390 --> 02:09.157
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes

02:09.729 --> 02:14.359
How do you measure
Measure a year?

02:14.534 --> 02:17.025
In daylights, in sunsets

02:17.237 --> 02:20.468
In midnights, in cups of coffee

02:20.640 --> 02:22.608
In inches, in miles

02:22.775 --> 02:25.175
In laughter, in strife

02:25.345 --> 02:30.544
In five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes

02:30.717 --> 02:35.586
How do you measure
A year in the life?

02:35.755 --> 02:40.988
How about love?

02:41.161 --> 02:46.360
How about love?

02:46.533 --> 02:51.800
How about love?

02:52.005 --> 02:55.941
Measure in love

02:56.109 --> 03:02.173
Seasons of love

03:02.348 --> 03:08.651
Seasons of love

03:09.556 --> 03:13.925
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes

03:14.527 --> 03:19.863
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Journeys to plan

03:20.033 --> 03:24.470
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes

03:24.637 --> 03:29.939
How do you measure
The life of a woman or a man?

03:30.109 --> 03:35.411
In truths that she learned?
Or in times that he cried?

03:35.582 --> 03:37.982
In bridges he burned?

03:38.151 --> 03:43.384
-Or the way that she died?
-It's time now to sing out

03:43.556 --> 03:46.616
Though the story never ends

03:46.793 --> 03:51.196
Let's celebrate
Remember a year in the life of friends

03:51.364 --> 03:54.765
Remember the love

03:54.934 --> 03:59.064
Oh, you got to
You got to remember the love

03:59.272 --> 04:03.368
You know that love is a gift
From up above

04:03.910 --> 04:09.041
Share love, give love, spread love

04:09.215 --> 04:14.175
Measure, measure your life in love

04:14.354 --> 04:20.156
Seasons of love

04:20.860 --> 04:22.259
Seasons of love

04:22.428 --> 04:29.197
Measure your life
Measure your life in love

04:48.288 --> 04:54.318
December 24th, 1989, 9 p.m.,
Eastern Standard Time.

04:55.895 --> 05:00.161
From here on in,
I shoot without a script.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.792
See if anything comes of it...

05:04.003 --> 05:06.437
...instead of my old shit.

05:06.606 --> 05:09.404
No, get out of here. Hey.

05:10.910 --> 05:13.344
I said, get off the window.

05:27.026 --> 05:29.324
How do you document real life

05:29.495 --> 05:34.296
When real life's getting more
Like fiction each day?

05:34.467 --> 05:36.560
Headlines, bread lines
Blow my mind

05:36.769 --> 05:41.206
And now this deadline
Eviction or pay

05:42.575 --> 05:43.906
Rent

05:44.077 --> 05:47.444
How do you write a song
When the chords sound wrong?

05:47.613 --> 05:51.174
Though they once sounded
Right and rare

05:51.351 --> 05:54.184
When the notes are sour
Where is the power

05:54.354 --> 05:58.085
You once had to ignite the air?

05:58.257 --> 06:01.158
-We're hungry and frozen
-Some life we've chosen

06:01.327 --> 06:06.230
-How we gonna pay?
-How we gonna pay?

06:06.399 --> 06:08.560
-How we gonna pay
-How we gonna pay

06:08.768 --> 06:12.704
-Last year's rent?
-Last year's rent?

06:16.209 --> 06:19.337
-HeIIo?
-Hey, guess who's back in town.

06:19.512 --> 06:23.107
It's CoIIins, man.
Throw down the key. CooI.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.010
Hey.

06:30.256 --> 06:32.417
-You got a Iight, man?
-Yeah.

06:32.592 --> 06:35.390
-Give me that shit.
-Come here, man.

06:36.295 --> 06:38.763
Get that son of a bitch.

06:45.138 --> 06:47.402
Pick his ass up. Come on.

06:53.913 --> 06:57.349
How do you start a fire
When there's nothing to burn

06:57.517 --> 07:01.715
And it feels like something's stuck
In your flue?

07:01.888 --> 07:05.346
How can you generate heat
When you can't feel your feet

07:05.525 --> 07:07.857
-And they're turning blue?
-And they're turning blue?

07:08.027 --> 07:09.187
You light up a mean blaze

07:09.362 --> 07:10.727
-With posters
-And screenplays

07:10.897 --> 07:13.263
-How we gonna pay?
-How we gonna pay?

07:13.433 --> 07:15.867
-How we gonna pay?
-How we gonna pay?

07:16.068 --> 07:18.536
-How we gonna pay
-How we gonna pay

07:18.738 --> 07:22.765
-Last year's rent?
-Last year's rent?

07:28.281 --> 07:30.215
How do you stay on your feet

07:30.383 --> 07:32.817
When on every street
It's trick or treat

07:32.985 --> 07:34.976
And tonight it's trick?

07:35.922 --> 07:38.482
Welcome back to town
Oh, I should lie down

07:38.658 --> 07:42.253
Everything's brown
And, uh-oh, I feel sick

07:42.895 --> 07:45.159
-Where is he?
-Getting dizzy

07:45.331 --> 07:47.561
-How we gonna pay?
-How we gonna pay?

07:47.733 --> 07:50.224
How we gonna pay?

07:50.403 --> 07:52.928
How we gonna pay

07:53.139 --> 07:57.405
Last year's rent?

07:57.577 --> 08:01.274
The music ignites the night
With passionate fire

08:02.849 --> 08:06.285
The narration crackles and pops
With incendiary wit

08:07.820 --> 08:10.584
Zoom in as they burn the past
To the ground

08:10.756 --> 08:13.657
And feel the heat
Of the future's glow

08:14.494 --> 08:16.985
How do you leave the past behind

08:17.163 --> 08:21.600
When it keeps finding ways
To get to your heart?

08:21.767 --> 08:25.498
It reaches way down deep
And tears you inside out

08:25.705 --> 08:29.004
Till you're torn apart
Rent

08:29.175 --> 08:33.111
How can you connect in an age
Where strangers, landlords, lovers

08:33.279 --> 08:36.145
Your own blood cells betray?

08:36.315 --> 08:38.510
What binds the fabric together

08:38.683 --> 08:44.087
When the raging, shifting winds
Of change keep ripping away?

08:44.256 --> 08:46.748
Draw a line in the sand
And then make a stand

08:46.926 --> 08:49.827
-Use your camera to spar
-Use your guitar

08:49.996 --> 08:52.226
When they act tough
You call their bluff

08:52.398 --> 08:55.026
We're not gonna pay

08:55.234 --> 08:57.566
We're not gonna pay

08:57.770 --> 09:00.170
We're not gonna pay

09:00.339 --> 09:02.773
Last year's rent

09:02.942 --> 09:05.570
This year's rent

09:05.745 --> 09:07.906
Next year's rent

09:08.080 --> 09:10.878
Rent, rent, rent, rent, rent

09:11.050 --> 09:13.143
We're not gonna pay rent

09:13.319 --> 09:27.029
'Cause everything is rent

09:44.383 --> 09:45.714
Hey.

09:45.885 --> 09:47.182
Bum.

09:47.753 --> 09:50.278
Get your ass off the Range Rover.

09:52.191 --> 09:53.624
Benny, that attitude toward...

09:53.793 --> 09:56.193
...the homeIess is exactIy what
Maureen is protesting.

09:56.362 --> 10:00.196
Maureen is protesting Iosing her
performance space...

10:00.900 --> 10:02.959
...not my attitude.

10:03.169 --> 10:05.501
Come down, I wanna taIk to you.

10:29.228 --> 10:32.857
CIose-up: Benjamin Coffin III.
Our ex-roommate...

10:33.032 --> 10:35.626
...who married AIIison Grey
of the Westport Greys.

10:36.235 --> 10:38.829
His father-in-Iaw bought
severaI buiIdings on the bIock...

10:39.038 --> 10:41.598
...and a nearby vacant Iot,
home to Tent City.

10:41.807 --> 10:44.640
Benny hopes to evict aII
of the homeIess from Tent City...

10:44.810 --> 10:46.243
...and buiId a cyber studio.

10:46.412 --> 10:50.212
Roger, you're Iooking good for a guy
coming off of a year of withdrawaI.

10:50.383 --> 10:53.011
-What do you want, Benny?
-WeII, my investor--

10:53.185 --> 10:55.483
-You mean, your father-in-Iaw?
-Right.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.123
Read about Maureen's performance
in the Village Voice.

10:58.290 --> 11:01.020
Got pissed and sent me down here
to coIIect the rent.

11:01.193 --> 11:04.424
-What rent?
-This past year's rent, which I Iet sIide.

11:04.597 --> 11:05.757
You said we were goIden.

11:05.931 --> 11:08.161
-When you bought the buiIding.
-We were roommates.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.427
-Remember, you Iived here?
-How couId I forget?

11:10.636 --> 11:13.503
You, me, CoIIins and Maureen.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.231
How is the drama queen?

11:15.441 --> 11:18.239
-She's getting ready for a performance.
-I know.

11:18.411 --> 11:21.437
-StiII her production manager?
-Not exactIy.

11:21.614 --> 11:24.674
-StiII dating her?
-I was dumped.

11:25.751 --> 11:27.946
-She got a new man?
-WeII....

11:28.120 --> 11:29.883
-No.
-What's his name?

11:30.089 --> 11:31.920
-Joanne.
-Joanne.

11:39.231 --> 11:40.960
Thanks for being so understanding.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.725
You expect sympathy
from the guy...

11:42.935 --> 11:44.835
...who shut off our power
on Christmas Eve?

11:46.205 --> 11:48.173
Got your attention, didn't it?

11:49.108 --> 11:51.076
What happened to Benny?

11:51.243 --> 11:57.546
What happened to his heart
And the ideals he once pursued?

11:57.717 --> 12:04.486
Any owner of that lot next door
Has a right to do with it as he pleases

12:04.657 --> 12:06.420
Happy birthday, Jesus

12:06.592 --> 12:08.389
-The rent
-You're wasting your time

12:08.561 --> 12:11.621
-We're broke
-You broke your word, this is absurd

12:11.797 --> 12:14.061
There is one way
You won't have to pay

12:14.233 --> 12:17.168
-I knew it.
-Next door, the home of CyberArts

12:17.336 --> 12:22.865
And now that the block is rezoned
Our dream can become a reality

12:23.075 --> 12:27.569
You'll see, boys

12:27.747 --> 12:32.480
You'll see, boys

12:32.651 --> 12:36.883
A state-of-the-art, digital,
Virtual interactive studio

12:37.056 --> 12:40.685
I'll forgo your rent
And on paper guarantee

12:40.860 --> 12:43.488
That you can stay here for free

12:43.662 --> 12:46.631
-If you do me one smaII favor.
-What?

12:46.799 --> 12:48.630
Convince Maureen
to canceI her protest.

12:48.834 --> 12:51.302
Why not just get an injunction
or caII the cops?

12:51.470 --> 12:53.438
I did, and they're on standby.

12:53.606 --> 12:58.543
But my investors would rather
I handle this quietly

12:58.744 --> 13:00.974
You can't quietIy wipe out
an entire tent city...

13:01.147 --> 13:03.047
...then watch It's A Wonderful Life
on TV.

13:03.215 --> 13:04.944
You wanna produce fiIms
and write songs?

13:05.117 --> 13:06.584
You need somewhere to do it

13:06.752 --> 13:10.950
It's what we used to dream about
Think twice before you pooh-pooh it

13:11.123 --> 13:14.456
You'll see, boys

13:15.361 --> 13:19.695
You'll see, boys

13:19.865 --> 13:24.131
You'll see the beauty of a studio

13:24.336 --> 13:28.432
That lets us do our work
And get paid

13:28.641 --> 13:32.771
With condos on the top
Whose rent keeps open our shop

13:32.945 --> 13:36.881
Just stop the protest
And you'll have it made

13:37.049 --> 13:39.540
You'll see

13:39.718 --> 13:41.686
Or you'II pack.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.195
Here you go.

13:59.438 --> 14:01.338
Merry Christmas.

14:20.826 --> 14:22.487
HeIIo?

14:33.572 --> 14:35.870
Oh, my God. You okay, honey?

14:36.041 --> 14:39.238
-I'm afraid so.
-Did they get anything, or...?

14:39.411 --> 14:42.505
I didn't have any money,
but they took my stuff.

14:43.449 --> 14:46.247
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.954
I'm AngeI.

14:53.459 --> 14:55.825
AngeI?

14:56.395 --> 14:58.693
Friends caII me CoIIins.

14:58.964 --> 15:01.398
Tom. Tom CoIIins.

15:03.769 --> 15:06.533
Come on. Let's get you cIeaned up.

15:12.177 --> 15:13.474
I sort of have to hurry.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.137
-I have a Life Support meeting.
-Life Support?

15:16.682 --> 15:18.274
Yeah.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.509
It's for peopIe with AIDS.

15:20.686 --> 15:22.517
PeopIe Iike me.

15:24.290 --> 15:25.951
Me too.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.329
I was gonna go try to find CoIIins.

15:37.536 --> 15:39.470
You wanna come?

15:40.072 --> 15:43.473
I thought maybe we couId aII grab
some dinner.

15:43.642 --> 15:46.076
Zoom in on my empty waIIet.

15:46.245 --> 15:48.110
Touch?.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.977
Take your AZT.

16:00.326 --> 16:06.231
I'm writing one great song
Before I....

17:08.460 --> 17:11.223
One song
Glory

17:11.930 --> 17:15.023
One song before I go

17:15.233 --> 17:20.171
Glory
One song to leave behind

17:20.672 --> 17:22.970
Find one song

17:23.142 --> 17:24.837
One last refrain

17:25.010 --> 17:29.572
Glory
From the pretty-boy front man

17:30.716 --> 17:34.948
Who wasted opportunity

17:35.120 --> 17:38.385
One song
He had the world at his feet

17:38.557 --> 17:43.494
Glory
In the eyes of a young girl

17:44.263 --> 17:46.458
A young girl

17:47.199 --> 17:49.497
Find glory

17:49.701 --> 17:51.760
Beyond the cheap colored lights

17:51.970 --> 17:54.404
One song
Before the sun sets

17:55.107 --> 17:56.404
Glory

17:56.575 --> 18:01.740
On another empty life

18:01.914 --> 18:05.042
Time flies

18:05.217 --> 18:10.382
Time dies

18:10.556 --> 18:15.960
Glory

18:16.295 --> 18:22.757
One blaze of glory

18:22.968 --> 18:29.464
One blaze of glory

18:29.942 --> 18:36.745
Glory

18:37.382 --> 18:39.850
Find glory

18:40.018 --> 18:44.978
In a song that rings true
Truth like a blazing fire

18:45.757 --> 18:48.385
An eternal flame

18:50.729 --> 18:52.856
Find one song

18:53.031 --> 18:56.523
A song about love
Glory

18:56.735 --> 18:59.898
From the soul of a young man

19:00.973 --> 19:02.873
A young man

19:04.042 --> 19:08.445
Find the one song
Before the virus takes hold

19:08.614 --> 19:11.344
Glory
Like a sunset

19:12.684 --> 19:18.281
One song
To redeem this empty life

19:18.824 --> 19:21.622
Time flies

19:21.793 --> 19:25.524
And then no need
To endure anymore

19:25.697 --> 19:31.101
Time dies

20:13.445 --> 20:16.812
-What'd you forget?
-Got a light?

20:16.982 --> 20:19.280
I know you, you're--

20:19.451 --> 20:20.975
You're shivering

20:21.153 --> 20:24.384
It's nothing
They turned off my heat

20:24.756 --> 20:33.130
And I'm just a little weak on my feet
Would you light my candle?

20:33.999 --> 20:36.729
-What are you staring at?
-Nothing

20:36.935 --> 20:40.462
Your hair in the moonlight

20:40.839 --> 20:42.864
You look familiar

20:45.110 --> 20:49.240
-Can you make it?
-Just haven't eaten much today

20:49.414 --> 20:53.043
At least the room
Stopped spinning anyway

20:53.218 --> 20:55.152
-What?
-Nothing

20:55.320 --> 20:59.654
-Your smile reminded me of--
-I always ''remind people of''

20:59.825 --> 21:01.725
-Who is she?
-She died

21:01.893 --> 21:05.124
-Her name was April
-It's out again

21:06.331 --> 21:13.703
Sorry 'bout your friend
Would you light my candle?

21:14.506 --> 21:16.531
-Well?
-Yeah?

21:18.176 --> 21:19.973
Oh, the wax

21:20.646 --> 21:22.409
-It's--
-Dripping

21:22.581 --> 21:25.744
-I like it between my--
-Fingers

21:25.917 --> 21:27.214
I figured

21:27.386 --> 21:29.149
Oh, well, good night

21:37.162 --> 21:41.360
-It blew out again?
-No, I think that I dropped my stash

21:41.533 --> 21:44.366
I know I've seen you out and about

21:44.569 --> 21:46.298
When I used to go out

21:46.905 --> 21:48.463
Your candle's out

21:49.374 --> 21:52.605
I'm illin'
I had it when I walked in the door

21:52.778 --> 21:55.947
It was pure
Is it on the floor?

21:55.947 --> 21:57.244
The floor?

21:57.749 --> 22:02.379
They say that I have the best ass
Below 1 4th Street

22:02.554 --> 22:04.852
-Is it true?
-What?

22:05.023 --> 22:07.548
-You're staring again
-Oh, no

22:07.726 --> 22:09.921
I mean, you do have a nice--

22:10.228 --> 22:12.093
I mean, you look familiar

22:12.264 --> 22:15.563
-Like your dead girlfriend
-Only when you smile

22:15.734 --> 22:18.362
But I'm sure I've seen you
Somewhere else

22:18.570 --> 22:22.563
Do you go to the Cat Scratch Club?
That's where I work

22:22.774 --> 22:24.264
I dance

22:24.710 --> 22:27.577
Yes
They used to tie you up

22:27.746 --> 22:29.111
It's a living

22:29.281 --> 22:32.409
I didn't recognize you
Without the handcuffs

22:32.584 --> 22:39.114
We could light the candle

22:39.291 --> 22:46.288
Oh, won't you light the candle?

22:47.632 --> 22:50.362
Why don't you forget that stuff

22:50.569 --> 22:54.471
-You look like you're 16
-I'm 19

22:54.639 --> 22:58.871
But I'm old for my age
I'm just born to be bad

22:59.044 --> 23:03.811
I once was born to be bad
I used to shiver like that

23:03.982 --> 23:06.212
-I have no heat, I told you
-I used to sweat

23:06.785 --> 23:09.955
-I got a cold
-Uh-huh, I used to be a junkie

23:09.955 --> 23:12.981
-But now and then I like to feel good
-Uh-huh

23:13.158 --> 23:14.682
-Oh, here
-What's that?

23:14.860 --> 23:16.589
Candy-bar wrapper.

23:16.762 --> 23:21.825
We could light the candle

23:23.235 --> 23:30.835
Oh, what'd you do with my candle?

23:32.544 --> 23:36.480
-That was my last match
-Our eyes'll adjust

23:36.648 --> 23:41.142
-Thank God for the moon
-Maybe it's not the moon at all

23:41.653 --> 23:44.486
I hear Spike Lee's shootin'
Down the street

23:44.656 --> 23:46.556
Bah humbug

23:48.260 --> 23:50.319
Bah humbug

23:50.495 --> 23:53.589
-Cold hands
-Yours too

23:53.765 --> 23:56.928
Big
Like my father's

23:57.636 --> 23:59.103
Do you wanna dance?

23:59.604 --> 24:01.037
With you?

24:01.239 --> 24:06.438
-No, with my father
-I'm Roger

24:06.611 --> 24:08.545
They call me

24:08.713 --> 24:13.616
They call me Mimi

24:44.182 --> 24:46.150
We got power.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.808
Merry Christmas.

24:47.986 --> 24:49.817
-Speak.
-Speak.

24:49.988 --> 24:51.853
Mark, are you there?

24:52.023 --> 24:54.890
Are you screening your calls?
It's Mom.

24:55.060 --> 24:58.621
I just wanted to call and say
we love you. We'll miss you today.

24:58.797 --> 25:00.958
Cindy and the kids are here.
They send their love.

25:01.132 --> 25:04.533
Hope you like the hot plate. Don't
leave it on when you leave the house.

25:04.736 --> 25:06.636
-Honey, give me the phone.
-Oh, here's Dad.

25:06.805 --> 25:09.774
Listen, Mark, I'm sorry to hear
that Maureen dumped you.

25:09.941 --> 25:13.468
I say, c'est la vie.
Let her be a lesbian.

25:13.645 --> 25:15.840
She doesn't know
what she's missing.

25:16.014 --> 25:17.879
Happy holidays.

25:19.718 --> 25:21.242
You know...

25:22.187 --> 25:25.213
...there are times
when we're dirt broke...

25:25.390 --> 25:27.950
...and hungry and freezing...

25:28.126 --> 25:32.756
...and I ask myseIf,
''Why the heII am I stiII Iiving here?''

25:33.598 --> 25:36.658
And then they caII.
And I remember.

25:44.476 --> 25:46.273
What's that?

25:49.648 --> 25:51.673
The girI downstairs.

25:51.850 --> 25:54.114
Oh, the dancer
from the Cat Scratch CIub?

25:55.687 --> 25:57.552
-WeII, you are going, right?
-No.

25:57.722 --> 25:59.690
-Oh, come on, Roger.
-No.

26:00.058 --> 26:03.186
-Merry Christmas, bitches.
-Hey, CoIIins.

26:03.795 --> 26:06.195
-Your keys.
-Yeah, 1 4 hours Iater.

26:06.364 --> 26:08.992
What the heII happened to you?
Are you aII right?

26:09.200 --> 26:11.293
I've never been better. Here.

26:11.503 --> 26:12.697
Oh, hi.

26:12.904 --> 26:16.704
-''Oh, hi.'' After seven months?
-I'm sorry.

26:16.875 --> 26:20.572
You know what you need?
This boy couId use...

26:20.745 --> 26:24.044
-...some StoIi.
-This is a compIete Christmas feast.

26:24.215 --> 26:27.385
-Thank you.
-You struck goId at MIT.

26:27.385 --> 26:29.046
No.

26:29.821 --> 26:32.915
They expeIIed me for my theory
of actuaI reaIity.

26:33.091 --> 26:35.559
One for you. One for you.

26:35.727 --> 26:37.126
Oh, wait.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.530
For me.

26:39.698 --> 26:42.064
So I came back home.
Merry Christmas.

26:42.267 --> 26:45.168
-Cheers.
-WeIcome home.

26:46.838 --> 26:48.362
I got a teaching gig at NYU.

26:48.573 --> 26:50.803
Oh, so that's how you can afford
to spIurge on us.

26:50.976 --> 26:52.841
No. Sit down.

26:54.946 --> 26:58.404
Gentlemen, our benefactor
On this Christmas day

26:58.583 --> 27:02.644
Whose charity is only matched
By talent, I must say

27:02.821 --> 27:06.780
A new member of the Alphabet City
Avant-garde

27:06.958 --> 27:15.024
Angel Dumott Schunard

27:19.871 --> 27:22.931
Today for you
Tomorrow for me

27:27.245 --> 27:29.907
Today for you
Tomorrow for me

27:30.081 --> 27:33.744
-And you should hear her beat
-You earned this on the street?

27:33.918 --> 27:37.376
It was my lucky day today
On Avenue A

27:37.555 --> 27:40.752
When a lady in a limousine
Drove my way

27:40.925 --> 27:44.486
She said, ''Darling, be a dear
Haven't slept in a year

27:44.663 --> 27:48.531
I need your help to make my
Neighbor's yappy dog disappear

27:48.700 --> 27:54.764
This Akita, Evita, just won't shut up
I believe if you play nonstop

27:54.973 --> 27:59.171
That pup will breathe its very last
High-strung breath

27:59.611 --> 28:03.138
I'm certain that cur
Will bark itself to death''

28:03.314 --> 28:06.750
Today for you
Tomorrow for me

28:06.918 --> 28:10.088
Today for you
Tomorrow for me

28:10.088 --> 28:14.718
We agreed on a fee
$1000 guarantee, tax free

28:14.893 --> 28:17.623
And a bonus if I trim her tree

28:17.796 --> 28:21.357
Now, who could foretell
That it would go so well?

28:21.533 --> 28:24.627
But sure as I am here
That dog is now in doggy hell

28:24.836 --> 28:28.203
After an hour, Evita, in all her glory

28:28.707 --> 28:32.370
On the window ledge
Of that 23rd story

28:32.544 --> 28:35.809
Like Thelma and Louise did
When they got the blues

28:35.980 --> 28:39.541
Swan-dove into the courtyard
Of the Gracie Mews

28:39.718 --> 28:43.154
Today for you
Tomorrow for me

28:43.321 --> 28:46.484
Today for you
Tomorrow for me

29:01.740 --> 29:04.538
Back on the street
Where I met my sweet

29:04.709 --> 29:08.702
Where he was moaning and groaning
On the cold concrete

29:08.880 --> 29:12.281
The nurse took him home
For some Mercurochrome

29:12.450 --> 29:15.419
Then I dressed his wounds
And got him back on his feet

29:15.587 --> 29:17.555
Sing it
Today for you

29:17.722 --> 29:19.553
Tomorrow for me

29:19.724 --> 29:22.625
Today for you
Tomorrow for me

29:22.794 --> 29:25.160
I say
Today for you

29:25.330 --> 29:28.390
Tomorrow for me
Today for you

29:28.566 --> 29:33.265
Tomorrow

29:33.838 --> 29:35.567
For me

29:36.775 --> 29:38.402
That was dope.

29:40.779 --> 29:41.973
That was fresh.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.811
-Speak.
-Speak.

29:46.985 --> 29:49.146
Mark. Hi.

29:49.320 --> 29:52.551
It's me. Maureen.
Look, I have a bit of a problem.

29:54.392 --> 29:55.723
I really need your help.

29:55.894 --> 29:58.158
I hired Joanne
as my production manager...

29:58.363 --> 30:00.957
...and I don't think she knows
what the hell she's doing.

30:01.199 --> 30:04.168
If you could just-- Please, baby,
come to the performance space.

30:04.302 --> 30:06.998
-Hey, Maureen. Hi.
-Hi, baby.

30:07.205 --> 30:09.264
-Sure, I'II be there.
-Thank you.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.203
-Okay.
-Thank you.

30:11.376 --> 30:13.071
Okay, see you soon.

30:13.244 --> 30:16.771
Can you beIieve her?
I mean, first she just dumps me--

30:16.981 --> 30:19.347
-Maureen dumped you?
-Yes. She dumped me.

30:19.517 --> 30:20.984
For a Iawyer named Joanne.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.822
Now she wants me to heIp her
fix her sound equipment.

30:27.992 --> 30:32.019
-WeII, Mark, you couId've said no.
-I know, but....

30:32.197 --> 30:35.223
-That's cute. You stiII Iove her.
-Yeah, right.

30:35.400 --> 30:36.594
You do.

30:41.806 --> 30:43.865
-We have to go.
-Wanna go to this gathering?

30:44.075 --> 30:45.542
-Where?
-Life Support.

30:45.743 --> 30:46.835
On Christmas?

30:47.045 --> 30:49.605
Some peopIe don't have
anywhere eIse to go today.

30:49.781 --> 30:51.214
You shouId come.

30:51.883 --> 30:53.248
Knock yourseIves out.

30:54.052 --> 30:56.520
Everyone's weIcome.
It's not just for peopIe with AIDS.

30:56.688 --> 31:00.180
Okay, yeah, I'II be there,
but first I got a protest to save.

31:00.425 --> 31:02.859
See? ToId you.

31:06.698 --> 31:09.599
I'm just pIaying with you, boy.

31:11.336 --> 31:12.894
WeII, it's Christmas.

31:13.104 --> 31:15.470
Don't stay in the house aII day.

31:15.640 --> 31:17.335
Bye.

31:59.884 --> 32:01.579
Hi.

32:02.654 --> 32:06.681
Maureen caIIed me to try to come
heIp fix the equipment.

32:06.858 --> 32:08.621
You're Mark?

32:09.427 --> 32:11.224
Joanne?

32:20.772 --> 32:25.106
-Maureen said she'd be here.
-WeII, don't hoId your breath.

32:25.276 --> 32:27.744
This is so typicaI.

32:27.912 --> 32:30.972
I toId her not to caII you.

32:31.549 --> 32:33.414
Oh, weII--

32:33.952 --> 32:36.182
Can I heIp anyway?

32:36.354 --> 32:38.788
I've hired an engineer.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.822
Great.

32:41.726 --> 32:44.126
WeII, nice to have met you, then.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.729
He's three hours Iate.

32:55.273 --> 32:57.673
The samples won't delay
But the cable--

32:57.842 --> 33:00.902
There's another way
Say something, anything

33:01.079 --> 33:03.274
Test, one, two, three

33:03.948 --> 33:06.041
Anything but that

33:08.186 --> 33:09.813
-This is weird
-It's weird

33:09.988 --> 33:11.717
-Very weird
-Fuckin' weird

33:11.889 --> 33:15.484
I'm so mad that
I don't know what to do

33:15.660 --> 33:19.255
Fighting with microphones
Freezing down to my bones

33:19.430 --> 33:22.627
And to top it all off
I'm with you

33:23.201 --> 33:26.796
Feel like going insane?
Got a fire in your brain?

33:27.005 --> 33:30.463
And you're thinking
Of drinking gasoline?

33:30.708 --> 33:34.542
-As a matter of fact
-Honey, I know this act

33:34.712 --> 33:37.613
It's called the Tango: Maureen

33:38.216 --> 33:41.777
The Tango: Maureen

33:41.953 --> 33:45.389
It's a dark, dizzy merry-go-round

33:45.556 --> 33:49.287
-As she keeps you dangling
-You're wrong

33:49.460 --> 33:53.055
-Your heart she is mangling
-It's different with me

33:53.231 --> 33:54.926
And you toss and you turn

33:55.099 --> 33:56.794
'Cause her cold eyes can burn

33:57.001 --> 34:00.027
Yet you yearn, and you churn
And rebound

34:00.505 --> 34:03.474
I think I know what you mean

34:03.641 --> 34:07.975
-The Tango: Maureen
-The Tango: Maureen

34:08.146 --> 34:14.141
Has she ever pouted her lips
And called you ''pookie'"?

34:14.318 --> 34:15.580
Never.

34:15.753 --> 34:19.120
Have you ever
Doubted a kiss or two?

34:19.290 --> 34:21.985
This is spooky

34:23.261 --> 34:25.855
Did you swoon
When she walked through the door?

34:26.030 --> 34:29.659
Every time, so be cautious

34:30.802 --> 34:33.362
Did she moon over other boys?

34:33.571 --> 34:37.098
-More than moon
-I'm getting nauseous

35:06.437 --> 35:08.200
Where'd you Iearn to tango?

35:08.372 --> 35:11.967
With the French ambassador's
daughter in her room at Miss Porter's.

35:12.143 --> 35:13.610
And you?

35:13.811 --> 35:16.143
With Nanette HimmeIfarb,
the rabbi's daughter...

35:16.314 --> 35:19.010
...at the ScarsdaIe Jewish
Community Center.

35:22.787 --> 35:25.119
It's hard to do this backwards.

35:25.723 --> 35:28.055
You shouId try it in heeIs.

35:52.283 --> 35:53.682
-She cheated
-She cheated

35:53.851 --> 35:55.682
-Maureen cheated
-Fuckin' cheated

35:55.853 --> 35:59.557
I'm defeated
I should give up right now

35:59.557 --> 36:03.049
Gotta look on the bright side
With all of your might

36:03.227 --> 36:06.788
I'd fall for her still, anyhow

36:06.964 --> 36:10.866
When you're dancing her dance
You don't stand a chance

36:11.068 --> 36:14.401
Her grip of romance makes you fall

36:14.572 --> 36:18.201
-So you think, ''Might as well''
-''Dance a tango to hell''

36:18.376 --> 36:21.470
''At least I'll have tangoed at all''

36:22.113 --> 36:25.640
The Tango: Maureen

36:25.816 --> 36:29.411
Gotta dance till your diva is through

36:29.587 --> 36:32.988
You pretend to believe her

36:33.157 --> 36:36.923
'Cause in the end
You can't leave her

36:37.094 --> 36:40.689
But the end, it will come
Still you have to play dumb

36:40.865 --> 36:43.629
Till you're glum and you bum
And turn blue

36:44.502 --> 36:48.029
Why do we love when she's mean?

36:48.239 --> 36:51.675
And she can be so obscene

36:53.644 --> 36:55.771
My Maureen

37:01.419 --> 37:03.353
The Tango:

37:03.521 --> 37:09.016
Maureen

37:10.561 --> 37:12.222
Mark.

37:13.197 --> 37:14.357
Mark.

37:14.832 --> 37:18.427
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

37:19.203 --> 37:21.068
ActuaIIy...

37:21.239 --> 37:23.469
...I feeI great now.

37:25.610 --> 37:27.635
I feeI Iousy.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.812
And we're patched.

37:37.955 --> 37:39.513
Thanks.

37:41.592 --> 37:42.923
-Maureen?
-Hi, baby.

37:43.094 --> 37:45.562
-Hi, honey, we're--
-Pookie.

37:45.730 --> 37:47.357
''Pookie''?

37:48.065 --> 37:50.761
-You never caIIed me pook--
-We're late.

37:53.170 --> 37:54.637
Forget it.

37:54.805 --> 37:57.535
-We're patched.
-Thank you.

37:59.710 --> 38:00.938
Pookie.

38:02.313 --> 38:03.974
Shut up.

38:32.510 --> 38:34.808
Okay, everyone, Iet's begin.

38:34.979 --> 38:38.278
First, I just want to weIcome you aII.

38:39.116 --> 38:43.109
Why don't we start by going
around and introducing ourseIves.

38:43.287 --> 38:45.084
Steve.

38:45.523 --> 38:47.047
Gordon.

38:47.224 --> 38:48.851
AIi.

38:49.327 --> 38:50.794
Pam.

38:50.961 --> 38:52.451
Sue.

38:52.630 --> 38:53.722
Hi.

38:55.700 --> 38:57.497
I'm AngeI.

38:58.102 --> 38:59.501
Tom.

38:59.670 --> 39:01.160
CoIIins.

39:01.605 --> 39:03.038
I'm PauI.

39:03.207 --> 39:04.640
Sorry.

39:04.809 --> 39:06.777
Excuse me.

39:11.115 --> 39:12.548
And you are...?

39:12.717 --> 39:16.278
Oh, I'm not--
I don't have--

39:17.021 --> 39:18.955
I'm here with....

39:23.761 --> 39:25.695
I'm just here to....

39:29.033 --> 39:30.762
Mark.

39:30.968 --> 39:33.198
Mark. I'm Mark.

39:38.409 --> 39:40.900
WeII, this is quite an operation.

39:43.981 --> 39:46.006
Does anyone have a probIem...

39:46.183 --> 39:48.674
...if I fiIm a IittIe of this
for a documentary?

39:55.626 --> 39:57.924
Make yourseIf comfortabIe, Mark.

40:01.332 --> 40:03.232
Who wants to begin?

40:05.703 --> 40:07.603
WeII, I'm--

40:12.810 --> 40:14.607
Yesterday...

40:16.080 --> 40:18.844
...I found out my T ceIIs were Iow.

40:19.016 --> 40:21.211
What was your reaction?

40:21.852 --> 40:23.319
Scared.

40:23.587 --> 40:27.148
How are you feeIing today?
Right now?

40:28.225 --> 40:29.783
Okay.

40:30.861 --> 40:32.453
AII right.

40:34.265 --> 40:35.755
Pretty good.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.829
Is that aII?

40:40.104 --> 40:42.538
It's the best I've feIt in a Iong time.

40:43.374 --> 40:47.310
-Months.
-Then why choose fear?

40:48.345 --> 40:50.074
I'm a New Yorker.

40:50.247 --> 40:52.078
Fear's my Iife.

41:00.057 --> 41:03.720
Look, I find
Some of what you teach suspect

41:03.894 --> 41:07.352
Because I'm used to
Relying on intellect

41:07.531 --> 41:10.989
But I try to open up
To what I don't know

41:11.202 --> 41:15.639
Because reason says
I should have died

41:15.840 --> 41:19.708
Three years ago

41:19.877 --> 41:22.846
There's only us

41:23.013 --> 41:26.540
There's only this

41:26.717 --> 41:29.652
Forget regret

41:30.120 --> 41:32.816
Or life is yours to miss

41:32.990 --> 41:36.221
No other road

41:36.393 --> 41:39.920
No other way

41:40.097 --> 41:46.036
No day but today

42:15.900 --> 42:18.562
What's the time?

42:18.769 --> 42:22.339
Well, it's gotta be close to midnight

42:22.339 --> 42:28.039
My body's talking to me
It says, ''Time for danger''

42:28.946 --> 42:32.109
It says, ''I wanna commit a crime

42:32.283 --> 42:35.912
Wanna be the cause of a fight

42:36.086 --> 42:38.680
I wanna put on a tight skirt

42:38.856 --> 42:41.757
And flirt with a stranger''

42:43.627 --> 42:46.653
I've had a knack from way back

42:46.830 --> 42:49.731
At breaking the rules
Once I learn the game

42:49.900 --> 42:53.131
Get up, life's too quick
I know someplace sick

42:53.337 --> 42:57.330
Where this chick'll
Dance in the flames

42:57.541 --> 43:00.635
We don't need any money

43:00.811 --> 43:03.746
I always get in for free

43:03.914 --> 43:06.109
You can get in too

43:06.283 --> 43:09.878
If you get in with me

43:10.054 --> 43:11.749
Let's go

43:11.922 --> 43:15.653
Out tonight

43:16.827 --> 43:18.260
I have to go

43:18.862 --> 43:22.628
Out tonight

43:25.102 --> 43:27.832
You wanna play?
Let's run away

43:28.038 --> 43:32.441
We won't be back
Before it's New Year's Day

43:32.610 --> 43:35.977
Take me out tonight

43:37.047 --> 43:38.412
Meow.

43:43.454 --> 43:45.684
Yeah

43:46.223 --> 43:49.158
When I get a wink
From the doorman

43:49.326 --> 43:51.590
Do you know how lucky you'll be?

43:52.062 --> 43:53.620
That you're on the line

43:53.797 --> 43:58.097
With the feline of Avenue B

43:58.302 --> 43:59.564
Let's go

44:00.304 --> 44:04.001
Out tonight

44:05.309 --> 44:07.038
I have to go

44:07.211 --> 44:10.703
Out tonight

44:13.384 --> 44:16.649
You wanna prowl?
Be my night owl?

44:16.820 --> 44:19.084
Well, take my hand we're gonna

44:19.256 --> 44:21.486
Howl

44:21.659 --> 44:24.059
Out tonight

44:27.331 --> 44:30.198
In the evening I've got to roam

44:30.401 --> 44:33.837
Can't sleep in the city
Of neon and chrome

44:34.304 --> 44:36.465
Feels too damn much like home

44:36.674 --> 44:41.111
When the Spanish babies cry

44:41.512 --> 44:43.673
So let's find a bar

44:43.847 --> 44:47.442
So dark we forget who we are

44:47.618 --> 44:53.523
Where all the scars
From the nevers and maybes die

44:53.691 --> 44:55.454
Let's go

44:55.626 --> 44:59.858
Out tonight

45:00.464 --> 45:02.489
I have to go

45:03.600 --> 45:06.034
Out tonight

45:08.872 --> 45:11.397
You're sweet
Wanna hit the street?

45:11.608 --> 45:14.839
Wanna wail at the moon
Like a cat in heat?

45:15.012 --> 45:16.877
Just take me

45:17.047 --> 45:19.777
Out tonight

45:21.085 --> 45:22.882
Please take me

45:23.053 --> 45:26.716
Out tonight

45:27.758 --> 45:30.022
Don't forsake me

45:30.194 --> 45:33.686
Out tonight

45:34.431 --> 45:37.093
I'll let you make me

45:37.301 --> 45:40.702
Out tonight

45:40.871 --> 45:42.065
Tonight

45:42.773 --> 45:44.138
Tonight

45:44.308 --> 45:45.434
Tonight

45:50.681 --> 45:53.851
Who do you think you are?

45:53.851 --> 45:57.343
Barging in on me and my guitar

45:57.521 --> 46:00.285
Little girl, hey, the door is that way

46:00.457 --> 46:03.722
You better go
You know the fire's out anyway

46:03.894 --> 46:06.761
Take your powder
Take your candle

46:06.930 --> 46:10.263
Your sweet whisper
I just can't handle

46:10.467 --> 46:13.300
Well, take your hair
In the moonlight

46:13.771 --> 46:19.266
Your brown eyes
Goodbye, good night

46:19.476 --> 46:21.740
I should tell you
I should tell you

46:21.912 --> 46:24.642
I should tell you, I should--
No.

46:24.815 --> 46:27.375
Another time, another place

46:27.551 --> 46:31.351
Our temperature would climb
There'd be a long embrace

46:31.522 --> 46:34.491
We'd do another dance
It'd be another play

46:34.658 --> 46:36.125
Looking for romance?

46:36.293 --> 46:40.252
Come back another day

46:40.831 --> 46:44.460
Another day

46:45.335 --> 46:48.168
The heart may freeze

46:48.338 --> 46:51.774
Or it can burn

46:51.942 --> 46:54.911
The pain will ease

46:55.345 --> 46:58.405
If I can learn

46:58.582 --> 47:01.813
There is no future

47:01.985 --> 47:05.011
There is no past

47:05.189 --> 47:08.317
I live this moment as

47:08.492 --> 47:12.258
My last

47:12.462 --> 47:15.761
There's only us

47:16.200 --> 47:19.536
There's only this

47:19.536 --> 47:22.835
Forget regret

47:23.006 --> 47:25.770
Or life is yours to miss

47:25.943 --> 47:29.538
No other road

47:29.713 --> 47:32.978
No other way

47:33.150 --> 47:38.645
No day but today

47:38.822 --> 47:41.518
Excuse me if I'm off track

47:41.692 --> 47:43.683
But if you're so wise
Then tell me

47:43.861 --> 47:45.556
Why do you need smack?

47:45.729 --> 47:46.991
Take your needle

47:47.164 --> 47:48.859
Take your fancy prayer

47:49.032 --> 47:52.160
Don't forget,
Get the moonlight out of your hair

47:52.369 --> 47:54.837
Long ago you might have
Lit up my heart

47:55.005 --> 48:00.375
But the fire's dead
Ain't never ever gonna start

48:01.311 --> 48:04.041
Another time
Another place

48:04.214 --> 48:07.809
The words would only rhyme
We'd be in outer space

48:07.985 --> 48:11.148
It'd be another song
We'd sing another way

48:11.321 --> 48:16.725
You wanna prove me wrong?
Come back another day

48:17.060 --> 48:21.929
Another day

48:22.099 --> 48:25.591
There's only yes

48:25.802 --> 48:28.965
Only tonight

48:29.172 --> 48:32.335
We must let go

48:32.509 --> 48:35.410
To know what's right

48:35.579 --> 48:39.140
No other course

48:39.316 --> 48:42.513
No other way

48:42.686 --> 48:48.852
No day but today

48:49.026 --> 48:52.553
I can't control

48:52.729 --> 48:55.562
Control your temper

48:55.732 --> 48:59.691
My destiny

48:59.870 --> 49:02.202
She doesn't see

49:02.372 --> 49:05.170
I trust my soul

49:05.342 --> 49:09.301
-Who says that there's a soul?
-My only goal

49:09.479 --> 49:13.506
Is just to be

49:13.684 --> 49:15.549
Just let me be

49:15.719 --> 49:22.215
-Who do you think you are?
-There's only now, there's only here

49:22.392 --> 49:28.763
-Barging in on me and my guitar
-Give in to love, or live in fear

49:28.932 --> 49:31.765
-Little girl, hey
-No other path

49:32.302 --> 49:36.238
-The door is that way
-No other way

49:36.440 --> 49:39.643
No day but today

49:39.643 --> 49:42.237
The fire's out anyway

49:42.412 --> 49:44.937
No day but today

49:45.115 --> 49:48.812
Take your powder
Take your candle

49:48.986 --> 49:51.682
No day but today

49:51.855 --> 49:55.518
Take your brown eyes,
Your pretty smile, your silhouette

49:55.692 --> 49:57.922
No day but today

49:58.095 --> 50:02.532
Another time, another place,
Another rhyme, a warm embrace

50:02.766 --> 50:04.563
No day but today

50:04.701 --> 50:07.829
Another dance,
Another way, another chance

50:08.038 --> 50:11.235
Another day

50:11.408 --> 50:18.371
No day but today

50:43.340 --> 50:45.331
-Speak.
-Speak.

50:45.542 --> 50:47.840
Mark, Roger, it's Benny.

50:48.045 --> 50:51.014
Look, you still got a few hours
to stop Maureen's protest.

50:51.181 --> 50:53.206
My offer expires after dark.

50:53.383 --> 50:54.372
Hey.

50:54.885 --> 50:56.477
How you doing?

51:01.892 --> 51:05.089
-Look, about Iast night--
-I don't wanna taIk about it.

51:07.397 --> 51:10.628
You know, Mimi's gonna be
at Maureen's show tonight.

51:10.901 --> 51:12.698
You shouId come too.

51:13.170 --> 51:16.537
I'd hate to see you pass up
something that couId be good for you.

51:17.474 --> 51:19.499
You'II onIy regret it.

51:19.910 --> 51:21.537
I'II Iive.

51:24.881 --> 51:26.405
Right.

51:57.380 --> 52:01.316
Will I lose my dignity?

52:01.485 --> 52:07.355
Will someone care?

52:07.524 --> 52:11.426
Will I wake tomorrow

52:11.595 --> 52:18.228
From this nightmare?

52:18.435 --> 52:22.895
Will I lose my dignity?

52:23.106 --> 52:29.067
Will someone care?

52:29.246 --> 52:32.875
Will I wake tomorrow

52:33.049 --> 52:40.012
From this nightmare?

52:40.190 --> 52:44.388
-Will I lose my dignity?
-Will I lose my dignity?

52:44.794 --> 52:47.354
Will someone care?

52:47.531 --> 52:50.898
Will someone care?

52:51.101 --> 52:54.628
-Will I wake tomorrow
-Will I wake tomorrow

52:54.838 --> 53:01.676
-From this nightmare?
-From this nightmare?

53:01.845 --> 53:06.179
-Will I lose my dignity?
-Will I lose my dignity?

53:06.349 --> 53:11.787
-Will someone care?
-Will I lose my dignity?

53:11.955 --> 53:16.255
-Will I wake tomorrow
-Will someone care?

53:16.426 --> 53:22.922
-From this nightmare?
-Will I wake tomorrow

53:23.099 --> 53:25.590
-Will I lose my dignity?
-From this nightmare?

53:25.802 --> 53:28.236
Will I lose my dignity?

53:28.405 --> 53:33.536
-Will someone care?
-Will I lose my dignity?

53:33.710 --> 53:37.840
-Will I wake tomorrow
-Will someone care?

53:38.014 --> 53:42.110
-From this nightmare?
-Will I wake tomorrow

53:42.285 --> 53:44.810
From this nightmare?

53:44.988 --> 53:49.049
-Will I lose my dignity?
-Will I lose?

53:49.226 --> 53:55.324
Will someone care?

53:55.498 --> 53:59.400
Will I wake tomorrow

53:59.603 --> 54:07.942
From this nightmare?

54:23.660 --> 54:25.150
I am so gIad you came, man.

54:25.328 --> 54:26.920
-I'm proud of you.
-Thanks.

54:27.097 --> 54:29.088
Come on, get up.

54:29.532 --> 54:31.295
Come on, Iet's go.

54:31.635 --> 54:33.432
-Wake up.
-This ain't a campground.

54:33.637 --> 54:34.626
Let's go. You gotta go.

54:34.838 --> 54:37.432
Christ, it's a Iady.
Come on, ma'am, you gotta get up.

54:37.641 --> 54:39.609
SmiIe for Ted KoppeI, officers.

54:43.146 --> 54:44.636
Who do you think you are?

54:44.814 --> 54:46.338
I don't need no goddamn heIp...

54:46.516 --> 54:48.677
...from some
bIeeding-heart cameraman.

54:48.852 --> 54:51.446
My Iife's not for you to make
a name for yourseIf on.

54:51.621 --> 54:53.680
Easy, sugar, easy.
He was just trying--

54:53.857 --> 54:55.984
Just trying to use me
to kiII his guiIt.

54:56.159 --> 54:58.593
It's not that kind of movie, honey.

54:58.762 --> 55:01.162
This pIace is fuII of artists.

55:01.765 --> 55:04.131
Hey, artist, you got a doIIar?

55:07.170 --> 55:09.104
Didn't think so.

55:23.119 --> 55:25.087
New York City

55:25.255 --> 55:27.519
-Center of the universe
-Sing it, girI.

55:27.691 --> 55:30.717
Times are shitty, but I'm pretty sure
They can't get worse

55:30.894 --> 55:33.692
-I hear that.
-It's a comfort to know

55:33.863 --> 55:36.127
When you're singing
The hit-the-road blues

55:36.299 --> 55:41.259
That anywhere else you could
Possibly go after New York would be

55:42.138 --> 55:43.571
A pleasure cruise

55:43.740 --> 55:46.072
Now you're taIking.

56:01.091 --> 56:04.458
Well, I'm thwarted by a
Metaphysic puzzle

56:05.395 --> 56:09.593
And I'm sick of grading papers,
That I know

56:10.333 --> 56:13.962
I'm shouting in my sleep
I need a muzzle

56:15.138 --> 56:19.472
And all this misery pays no salary
So

56:19.642 --> 56:24.272
Let's open up a restaurant
In Santa Fe

56:24.447 --> 56:28.611
Sunny Santa Fe would be nice

56:28.785 --> 56:33.017
We'll open up a restaurant
In Santa Fe

56:33.189 --> 56:37.922
And leave this
To the roaches and mice

56:54.043 --> 56:55.977
-You teach?
-Yeah, I teach.

56:56.146 --> 56:58.137
Computer Age PhiIosophy.

56:58.314 --> 57:00.748
When my students
wouId rather watch TV.

57:00.917 --> 57:02.942
-America.
-America.

57:03.119 --> 57:04.950
You're a sensitive aesthete

57:05.121 --> 57:07.589
Brush the sauce onto the meat

57:07.757 --> 57:11.090
You can make the menu
Sparkle with a rhyme

57:11.628 --> 57:13.960
You can drum a gentle drum

57:14.130 --> 57:16.360
I can seat guests as they come

57:16.533 --> 57:21.266
Chatting not about Heidegger,
But wine

57:21.471 --> 57:25.237
Let's open up a restaurant
In Santa Fe

57:25.408 --> 57:28.707
-Santa Fe
-Our labors would reap financial gain

57:28.912 --> 57:29.879
-Gain
-Gain

57:30.079 --> 57:31.569
-Gain
-We'll open up

57:31.748 --> 57:34.216
A restaurant in Santa Fe

57:34.384 --> 57:37.512
-Santa Fe
-And save from devastation our brains

57:37.687 --> 57:39.120
Save our brains

57:39.289 --> 57:44.226
We'll pack up all ourjunk
And fly so far away

57:44.394 --> 57:48.956
Devote ourselves to projects
That sell

57:49.132 --> 57:53.330
We'll open up a restaurant
In Santa Fe

57:53.536 --> 57:57.905
Forget this cold bohemian hell

58:23.399 --> 58:28.132
Do you know the way
To Santa Fe?

58:28.338 --> 58:31.171
You know, tumbleweeds

58:31.341 --> 58:33.969
Prairie dogs

58:34.944 --> 58:37.071
Yeah

58:43.119 --> 58:45.644
Oh, guys, I'm Iate for Maureen's
sound check. I gotta go.

58:45.822 --> 58:47.653
-Here, you can heIp me.
-Bye.

58:47.824 --> 58:49.314
See you Iater.

58:53.029 --> 58:54.690
It's coId.

58:55.598 --> 58:57.327
Come on.

59:01.237 --> 59:03.262
Live in my house

59:03.439 --> 59:05.430
I'll be your shelter

59:05.642 --> 59:10.136
Just pay me back
With 1000 kisses

59:10.346 --> 59:12.644
Be my lover

59:13.483 --> 59:18.318
I'll cover you

59:18.488 --> 59:22.652
Open your door
I'll be your tenant

59:22.825 --> 59:26.818
Don't got much baggage
To lay at your feet

59:26.996 --> 59:30.625
But sweet kisses I've got to spare

59:30.800 --> 59:34.998
I'll be there and I'll cover you

59:35.171 --> 59:37.264
-I think they meant it
-I think they meant it

59:37.440 --> 59:39.567
-When they said you can't buy love
-When they said you can't buy love

59:39.776 --> 59:41.767

01:00:01.397 --> 01:00:03.524
-Just slip me on
-Just slip me on

01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:05.533
-I'll be your blanket
-I'll be your blanket

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:07.670
-Wherever, whatever
-Wherever, whatever

01:00:07.837 --> 01:00:09.737
-I'll be your coat
-I'll be your coat

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:13.899
You'll be my king
And I'll be your castle

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:18.672
No, you'll be my queen
And I'll be your moat

01:00:18.881 --> 01:00:20.712
-I think they meant it
-I think they meant it

01:00:20.883 --> 01:00:22.874
-When they said you can't buy love
-When they said you can't buy love

01:00:23.052 --> 01:00:25.247
-Now I know you can rent it

01:00:25.421 --> 01:00:27.616
-A new lease you are, my love

-On life
-On life

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:35.026
-All my life
-All my life

01:00:35.431 --> 01:00:37.899
-I've longed to discover
-I've longed to discover

01:00:38.067 --> 01:00:43.334
-Something as true as this is
-Something as true as this is

01:00:43.506 --> 01:00:47.943
-So with a thousand sweet kisses
-When you're cold and you're lonely

01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:50.204
I'll cover you

01:00:50.413 --> 01:00:52.574

Look around.
Got pIenty of customers.

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:08.455
Look.

01:02:09.692 --> 01:02:12.525
About Iast night, I'm sorry.

01:02:13.229 --> 01:02:15.697

01:02:20.837 --> 01:02:22.099
How?

01:02:22.271 --> 01:02:24.398
Bunch of us
are getting together tonight.

01:02:24.607 --> 01:02:26.666
At the Life Caf?
after Maureen's show.

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:28.468
Yeah?

01:02:30.313 --> 01:02:32.110
WouId you Iike to come with me?

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:38.785
Sure. I'd Iike that.

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:47.059
So you're a tough guy?

01:02:47.363 --> 01:02:49.228
No. Not reaIIy.

01:02:49.398 --> 01:02:51.263
That's pretty good.

01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:01.669
Over there.
The guy with the gIasses.

01:03:01.878 --> 01:03:03.311
Right there.

01:03:03.479 --> 01:03:05.845
-AngeI.
-Mimi.

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:09.812
Oh, my God, you Iook so good.

01:03:55.431 --> 01:03:58.332
Maureen! Maureen! Maureen!

01:04:12.048 --> 01:04:14.744
Last night I had a dream.

01:04:15.551 --> 01:04:21.387
I found myseIf in a desert
caIIed CyberIand.

01:04:21.557 --> 01:04:22.785
It was hot.

01:04:22.959 --> 01:04:25.189
My canteen had sprung a Ieak,
and I was...

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:27.990
...thirsty.

01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:31.497
Out of the abyss waIked a cow.

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:32.895
EIsie.

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:36.500
I asked if she had anything to drink.
She said:

01:04:36.672 --> 01:04:43.305
''I'm forbidden to produce milk

01:04:43.512 --> 01:04:47.812
In Cyberland we only drink

01:04:49.485 --> 01:04:51.350
Diet Coke''

01:04:53.522 --> 01:04:54.784
She said:

01:04:57.059 --> 01:04:58.959
''Only thing to do

01:04:59.128 --> 01:05:03.690
Is jump over the moon''

01:05:06.302 --> 01:05:10.739
I

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:13.239
Gotta get out of here

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:18.874
It's like I'm being tied to the hood
Of a yellow rental truck

01:05:19.048 --> 01:05:23.314
Being packed in
With fertilizer and fuel oil

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:28.583
Pushed over a cliff
By a suicidal Mickey Mouse

01:05:30.693 --> 01:05:34.493
I've

01:05:34.664 --> 01:05:40.500
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:44.536
Gotta, gotta find a way

01:05:46.375 --> 01:05:50.175
To jump over the moon

01:05:50.346 --> 01:05:55.511
Only thing to do
Is jump over the moon

01:05:55.685 --> 01:05:58.153
Yeah! Go, Maureen!

01:05:58.921 --> 01:06:02.118
Then a IittIe buIIdog entered.

01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:05.920
His name, we have Iearned,
was Benny.

01:06:08.531 --> 01:06:10.965
And aIthough he once
had principIes...

01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:14.034
...he abandoned them
to Iive as a Iapdog...

01:06:14.203 --> 01:06:16.671
...to a weaIthy daughter
of the revoIution.

01:06:17.206 --> 01:06:20.937
A one, two, three
''That's bull,'' he said

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:26.677
''Ever since the cat took up the fiddle
That cow's been jumpy

01:06:26.849 --> 01:06:30.717
The dish and the spoon were evicted
From the table and eloped

01:06:30.886 --> 01:06:33.912
She's had trouble with that milk
And the moon ever since

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:36.718
Maybe it's a female thing

01:06:36.892 --> 01:06:41.124
'Cause who'd wanna leave
Cyberland anyway?

01:06:41.297 --> 01:06:42.889
Walls ain't so bad

01:06:43.065 --> 01:06:45.966
The dish and the spoon, for instance,
They're down on their luck

01:06:46.135 --> 01:06:48.160
They come knockin'
On my doghouse door

01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:50.601
And I say,
'Not in my back yard, utensils.

01:06:50.806 --> 01:06:52.467
Go back to China'''

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:58.378
''The onIy way out is up,''
EIsie whispered to me.

01:06:58.547 --> 01:07:02.950
''A leap

01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:07.215
Of faith''

01:07:08.557 --> 01:07:09.785
-Yeah.
-That's it.

01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:11.483
''StiII thirsty?''

01:07:13.095 --> 01:07:14.528
''Parched.''
