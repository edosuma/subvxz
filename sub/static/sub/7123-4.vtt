Ahh.

00:53.011 --> 00:54.763
<i>Oh, oh, man.</i>

00:54.846 --> 00:56.189
My throwing-and-catching disc.

00:56.265 --> 00:57.575
Jake, want to play
throw-and-catch the

00:57.599 --> 00:58.660
throwing-and-catching disc?

00:58.684 --> 01:00.277
Yeah, man.

01:00.352 --> 01:01.649
Throw and catch!

01:01.728 --> 01:02.820
Throw and catch!

01:02.896 --> 01:04.489
I call dog, and you be human.

01:04.565 --> 01:05.407
All right.

01:05.482 --> 01:06.904
Yeah. Whoo!

01:06.984 --> 01:08.361
It's gonna be awesome!

01:08.443 --> 01:09.285
Dog!

01:09.361 --> 01:10.487
Dog! Dog! Dog! Dog!

01:10.571 --> 01:11.697
You mean "Bark."

01:11.780 --> 01:12.622
What?

01:12.698 --> 01:13.950
Oh, yeah.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.875
Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark!

01:16.994 --> 01:20.168
Hello, I'm a human.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.133
Ready, bark!

01:23.208 --> 01:24.505
Back up a little.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.645
And now for the perfect throw.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.101
Ah! Oh! My hammies.

01:44.146 --> 01:47.400
Perfect throw!

01:52.112 --> 01:54.160
More like the perfect "blow."

01:54.239 --> 01:55.411
That blew.

01:55.490 --> 01:56.366
Oh, come on.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.292
That was the wind.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.744
The wind blows.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.165
Hey, you want me to grab it?

02:03.248 --> 02:04.625
No, I'll get it.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.301
Okay, but it's right here.

02:06.376 --> 02:10.631
Sometimes a man just has
to retrieve his own disc.

02:13.925 --> 02:14.767
Good luck, buddy.

02:14.843 --> 02:16.140
Thanks.

02:26.521 --> 02:27.943
Hup!

02:29.900 --> 02:31.743
Pbht!

02:31.818 --> 02:34.287
Oh, well, hello
there, my friend.

02:34.363 --> 02:35.740
What are you doing?

02:35.822 --> 02:38.200
I'm trying to get to the top
of this tree to get my disc.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.661
Oh, well, maybe I can help.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.507
Sit on me.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.255
Uh, what?

02:47.334 --> 02:50.463
Well, sit on my needles.

02:50.545 --> 02:53.845
The shock will boost you
high up into the air.

02:53.924 --> 02:54.971
Sit on me.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.927
It's fine. Go ahead.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.479
I don't think that kind of
thing really works, actually.

02:59.554 --> 03:02.433
You can do it if you
believe in yourself.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.018
Sit on me.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.190
No.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.021
Oh, all right.

03:08.105 --> 03:09.698
I'll show you.

03:11.483 --> 03:12.405
Ouch!

03:12.484 --> 03:13.280
Sorry.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.486
I thought that would work.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.748
I'm just no help at all.

03:23.787 --> 03:25.004
Ooch.

03:26.331 --> 03:27.331
Hmm.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.595
See, you did help.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.434
Pooped.

03:42.139 --> 03:43.516
Pooped.

03:46.184 --> 03:48.278
- Oh, I apologize for staring.
- Hmm?

03:48.353 --> 03:50.276
But I've never seen a
chipmunk <i>as</i> big <i>as</i> you.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.232
I'm not a chipmunk.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.191
I'm a human boy.

03:53.275 --> 03:54.777
I'm trying to climb the tree.

03:54.860 --> 03:58.239
I'm trying to get my disc back,
but for now, I'm taking a break,

03:58.321 --> 04:00.995
'cause I am pooped.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.918
You should eat an apple to
re-invigorate your climbing ability.

04:03.994 --> 04:04.870
No thanks.

04:04.953 --> 04:05.749
I'm good.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.297
Just gonna rest my meathooks.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.968
Huh? Huh?

04:25.724 --> 04:28.398
Ohh, that apple was
cursed or something.

04:28.477 --> 04:29.774
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.196
Oh, dear.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.525
I ruined your day, and now
you'll never get your disc.

04:34.608 --> 04:35.655
No, it's okay.

04:35.734 --> 04:37.327
I've been in worse situations.

04:37.402 --> 04:40.121
And even though I'm tiny,
I do feel invigorated.

04:40.197 --> 04:41.619
Oh, good.

04:41.698 --> 04:42.915
What a relief.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.039
Best of luck to you.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.495
Bye-bye.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.546
Choo-choo!

04:49.581 --> 04:51.879
You can't stop this train, tree.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.137
Hyah!

05:18.610 --> 05:20.704
Whoa, you're tiny.

05:20.779 --> 05:23.077
I ate a magic apple by mistake.

05:23.156 --> 05:26.126
Oh, no wonder it's
been taking so long.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.202
You need any help?

05:27.285 --> 05:28.457
Nah, I got it.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.790
Okay, well, I'm gonna
walk Lady home.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.089
I'll be back later.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.884
Don't eat any more
magic apples, silly.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.553
Yeah, no, I won't.

05:36.628 --> 05:37.675
I don't plan to.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.014
Thank you for packing.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.346
You should take it easy.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.775
No, no, let's get you back.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.237
Bleh.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.564
Disc!

06:11.913 --> 06:13.586
Whoo!

06:13.665 --> 06:15.633
Where's my dingus?

06:19.421 --> 06:20.843
Hey! Hey, buddy!

06:20.922 --> 06:22.595
Hey, have you seen my disc?!

06:22.674 --> 06:25.223
Wrap it up good so I
don't trip and fall

06:25.302 --> 06:27.805
on my face like the last time.

06:27.888 --> 06:28.888
Hey!

06:30.015 --> 06:31.358
Must have could not heard me.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.982
Doink. Doink. Doink.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.607
Hey. Squirrel!

06:39.816 --> 06:43.320
I think we all agree the
human must be stopped.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.030
Whoa.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.161
- Squirrel, what happened
with the apple'?

06:47.240 --> 06:50.164
- Well, I made sure he ate that
apple like you guys told me

06:50.243 --> 06:51.790
to do, but get this.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.497
It made him smaller.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.753
I think it might have
been cursed, you guys.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.584
Well, of course, it was cursed.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.841
We're trying to stop the human.

07:02.589 --> 07:06.514
Look, just do me a kindness and
go get me some more nutmilk.

07:07.552 --> 07:08.929
Come on, fellas.

07:09.012 --> 07:11.115
I feel like I'm the only one
coming up with ideas here.

07:11.139 --> 07:13.767
Lenny, how do you think
we should stop the human?

07:13.850 --> 07:17.195
Um... maybe a trap door?

07:17.270 --> 07:18.192
Something like that?

07:18.271 --> 07:19.147
With gravity?

07:19.230 --> 07:20.230
Hey, yeah.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.651
We could put, like,
a rug over it.

07:23.735 --> 07:24.735
My disc!

07:24.778 --> 07:25.778
Aah!

07:25.820 --> 07:26.946
Urn, it's okay.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.532
I'm a chipmunk.

07:28.615 --> 07:31.664
In the tree, part of the tree.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.586
In the tree, part of the tree.

07:34.996 --> 07:35.996
Sorry.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.386
In the tree, part of the tree.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.510
In the tree, part of the tree.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.182
Hyah!

07:52.764 --> 07:54.141
Huh?

07:55.433 --> 07:56.525
What?

07:56.601 --> 07:58.103
Uh, I didn't say anything.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.289
What are they gonna do to me?

08:00.313 --> 08:01.235
What?

08:01.314 --> 08:02.236
What are they gonna do...

08:02.315 --> 08:04.238
I'm not allowed to talk to you.

08:06.611 --> 08:09.239
Anyone or anything that winds up
in the tree becomes part of the

08:09.322 --> 08:11.245
tree forever and ever.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.326
In the tree, part of the tree.

08:13.410 --> 08:16.004
So does that mean I'm
a prisoner forever?

08:16.079 --> 08:18.548
Well, yes and no.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.421
Are you a prisoner? Yes.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.093
Will you ever be free? No.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.841
In the tree, part of the tree...

08:23.920 --> 08:25.422
It's very simple.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.483
Doesn't that mean you can't
leave the tree, either?

08:27.507 --> 08:30.226
No, I... well, yes and no.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.303
Am I allowed to leave the tree?
No.

08:32.386 --> 08:33.764
Have I already left the tree?

08:33.847 --> 08:37.442
Am I miles away from the tree
right now flying around like the

08:37.517 --> 08:39.394
flying squirrel that I am?

08:39.477 --> 08:40.729
Yes.

08:40.812 --> 08:44.236
In my mind.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.696
Do you like it here?

08:49.779 --> 08:51.907
Yeah... well, yes and no.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.913
Do I like the nuts and acorns?
Yes.

08:53.992 --> 08:56.012
Do I like it when they put me
down and say mean things like,

08:56.036 --> 08:57.253
"You're not a flying squirrel.

08:57.328 --> 08:58.796
You're just a regular squirrel.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.215
Nyah!"

09:00.290 --> 09:01.462
No.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.181
Do I want to fly away
from this place now?

09:03.251 --> 09:04.251
Yes.

09:04.294 --> 09:05.563
Would I make a break for it if I

09:05.587 --> 09:06.981
had a buddy to break
out of here with'?

09:07.005 --> 09:07.927
Yes.

09:08.006 --> 09:09.053
Hey, buddy.

09:09.132 --> 09:10.554
What?

09:10.633 --> 09:11.976
Let's get out of here.

09:19.809 --> 09:20.981
I got it!

09:21.061 --> 09:24.361
What are you doing, regular,
non-flying squirrel?

09:24.439 --> 09:25.907
Put that back.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.234
Pbht!

09:28.610 --> 09:29.953
How dare you!

09:32.238 --> 09:33.911
Well, all right.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.994
Everybody, after those...

09:37.077 --> 09:38.077
two.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.338
Okay, I'm gonna throw the
disc alongside the branch.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.260
Then we'll jump on
it and fly away.

09:46.336 --> 09:47.588
Yeah!

09:47.670 --> 09:49.047
Perfect throw!

09:55.261 --> 09:59.232
So, it's a good thing you're
a flying squirrel, huh?

09:59.307 --> 10:01.776
Well, yes and no.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.353
In the tree, part of the tree.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.655
In the tree, part of the tree.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.607
In the tree, part of the tree.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.818
In the tree, part of the tree.

10:09.901 --> 10:11.778
In the tree.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.454
Peace out!

10:17.742 --> 10:20.712
Okay, activate your
squirrel flaps.

10:20.787 --> 10:21.787
Flaps?

10:21.830 --> 10:24.834
No, I just have regular
squirrel arms.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.928
Hey. We're flying!

10:37.345 --> 10:38.187
Ohh!

10:38.263 --> 10:39.263
Oh, yeah.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.059
Whoo!

10:56.197 --> 10:57.039
Hey, look.

10:57.115 --> 10:58.116
There's Jake.

10:58.199 --> 11:02.295
Jake!

11:03.371 --> 11:05.965
The perfect throw.
