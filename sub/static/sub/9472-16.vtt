00:08.073 --> 00:09.374
This week on "Vice,"

00:09.476 --> 00:12.267
the search for a cure for ALS.

00:13.313 --> 00:14.873
Robert Hebron:
<i>We're fighting the clock.</i>

00:14.948 --> 00:18.463
What I don't know is if there's
enough time for my daughter.

00:18.591 --> 00:21.459
How many people in the US
are getting your drug?

00:21.561 --> 00:22.660
In the US, nobody.

00:22.762 --> 00:24.662
The FDA is worried about safety.

00:24.764 --> 00:27.832
<i>Every day that passes,
he's losing more of himself.</i>

00:53.359 --> 00:56.360
In 2014, the Ice Bucket Challenge

00:56.463 --> 00:58.629
raised more than $220 million

00:58.731 --> 01:00.765
<i>for research into ALS.</i>

01:02.569 --> 01:05.169
Shane: <i>Now, it put this
fatal neurological disease</i>

01:05.271 --> 01:07.237
<i>in the national spotlight
for the first time</i>

01:07.340 --> 01:10.908
<i>since Lou Gehrig's famous
diagnosis in 1939.</i>

01:11.010 --> 01:13.377
Today is the day

01:13.480 --> 01:16.581
I consider myself the luckiest man

01:16.683 --> 01:19.216
on the face of the earth.

01:21.921 --> 01:23.253
But for us here at "Vice,"

01:23.356 --> 01:25.656
this was already
a very personal story.

01:33.867 --> 01:39.103
<i>My name is Angelina Fanous,
and I work at "Vice."</i>

01:41.579 --> 01:44.080
I wrote the
article for VICE.com

01:44.182 --> 01:46.548
"The Worst Part
of the Ice Bucket Challenge

01:46.650 --> 01:48.851
is the People Criticizing It."

01:50.221 --> 01:52.654
<i>Critics of the Ice Bucket
Challenge dismissed it</i>

01:52.757 --> 01:55.191
<i>as viral narcissism,
where people were</i>

01:55.292 --> 01:58.560
<i>more interested in showing off
than helping out.</i>

01:58.662 --> 02:01.330
<i>I wrote the article
because the campaign raised</i>

02:01.432 --> 02:03.298
<i>hundreds of millions of dollars</i>

02:03.400 --> 02:05.067
<i>and it brought attention to a cause</i>

02:05.169 --> 02:09.238
<i>that had been widely ignored
for over 75 years.</i>

02:09.340 --> 02:12.474
<i>But that wasn't the only
reason I wrote it.</i>

02:16.280 --> 02:18.748
Fanous: I was just having
trouble typing at first,

02:18.850 --> 02:22.351
turning on my blow dryer...
you know, the little things,

02:22.453 --> 02:23.819
and I didn't think anything of it

02:23.921 --> 02:27.556
until one day I went
to spray sun-tan lotion,

02:27.658 --> 02:30.993
and the sun-tan lotion slipped
completely out of my hand.

02:31.095 --> 02:33.028
And I remember looking down

02:33.131 --> 02:34.396
and thinking, "Oh, my god,

02:34.498 --> 02:37.066
this is what
paralysis looks like."

02:41.906 --> 02:45.241
<i>Within a week,
the best-case scenario</i>

02:45.342 --> 02:48.744
<i>went from shoulder surgery</i>

02:48.846 --> 02:50.312
<i>to spinal surgery</i>

02:50.414 --> 02:53.249
to something we can't treat.

02:54.819 --> 02:57.820
And I didn't know what
"something we can't treat" was.

02:57.922 --> 02:59.155
Like, what is that?

02:59.257 --> 03:01.857
Like, would I just have, like,
a really fucked up left hand

03:01.959 --> 03:03.492
for the rest of my life?

03:05.163 --> 03:08.898
Until my neurologist gave me
a phone number to call

03:09.000 --> 03:10.632
for a follow up.

03:10.734 --> 03:13.735
He's like, "You need to call
this for a second opinion."

03:13.838 --> 03:17.873
So, the next day, I called,

03:17.975 --> 03:21.076
and the woman who answered said,

03:21.179 --> 03:26.982
"Thank you for calling the ALS and Lou
Gehrig's Disease Center at Columbia."

03:27.084 --> 03:29.051
And I dropped the phone.

03:29.153 --> 03:31.420
And I just sat on my bed.

03:32.423 --> 03:33.789
I cried.

03:43.034 --> 03:45.301
<i>People now know what ALS is,</i>

03:45.402 --> 03:48.103
<i>but most don't understand
how quickly the disease</i>

03:48.206 --> 03:50.605
<i>destroys your body and how hard it is</i>

03:50.708 --> 03:52.975
<i>to find any kind of treatment.</i>

03:54.378 --> 03:58.047
<i>So, I set out to do a non-traditional
piece of journalism:</i>

03:58.149 --> 04:00.249
<i>Reporting from
the patient's perspective</i>

04:00.351 --> 04:03.652
<i>and showing firsthand
the challenges we face.</i>

04:03.754 --> 04:05.020
<i>I started with one</i>

04:05.122 --> 04:07.256
<i>of the first commenters on my story:</i>

04:07.358 --> 04:09.992
<i>Robert Hebron and his daughter Beth.</i>

04:11.128 --> 04:13.128
Hi, my name is Beth Hebron.

04:13.231 --> 04:16.464
I'm here doing
the Ice Bucket Challenge.

05:32.576 --> 05:33.675
You know, it started out

05:33.777 --> 05:36.111
with she needs help cutting her food.

05:36.213 --> 05:37.046
Okay.

05:37.148 --> 05:38.547
You get over it, you deal with it,

05:38.649 --> 05:39.714
you move on.

05:39.817 --> 05:42.284
And then it's like,
okay, she needs help

05:42.386 --> 05:45.054
unzippering her pants
to go to the bathroom.

05:45.156 --> 05:46.488
Okay.

05:46.590 --> 05:48.257
Learn how to do it.

05:48.359 --> 05:49.524
Deal with it, move on.

05:49.626 --> 05:52.394
To lose that autonomy
and your independence...

05:52.496 --> 05:54.830
nobody gives that up easily.

05:54.932 --> 05:56.798
You hang on to that
as long as you can.

06:53.457 --> 06:55.824
I really believe
this will be cured someday.

06:55.926 --> 06:57.326
You know?

06:57.428 --> 07:00.662
What I don't know is if there's
enough time for my daughter.

07:00.764 --> 07:03.899
And I really, you know,
kind of hope and pray there is.

07:04.001 --> 07:08.070
But we're...
we're fighting the clock.

07:08.172 --> 07:10.839
Fanous: <i>ALS researchers are
fighting the clock too,</i>

07:10.941 --> 07:14.176
<i>racing to find
an effective treatment.</i>

07:14.278 --> 07:15.911
<i>To see what progress they've made,</i>

07:16.013 --> 07:18.480
<i>I visited the world's
first research center</i>

07:18.582 --> 07:20.315
<i>solely focused on this disease:</i>

07:20.418 --> 07:23.852
<i>The ALS Therapy
Development Institute.</i>

07:23.954 --> 07:26.721
<i>Dr. Steve Perrin gave me
a candid explanation</i>

07:26.823 --> 07:29.458
<i>of what ALS patients are up against.</i>

07:29.560 --> 07:32.094
What happens when
you get this disease?

07:32.196 --> 07:34.430
Unrelenting muscle loss

07:34.532 --> 07:36.698
from wherever you get
your first symptoms

07:36.800 --> 07:38.333
to spreading across the body.

07:38.436 --> 07:42.371
Dr. Perrin: <i>The motor neurons
that control your movements,</i>

07:42.473 --> 07:45.207
<i>the brain of the cell
is up in your spinal cord.</i>

07:45.309 --> 07:47.276
<i>It sends these processes</i>

07:47.378 --> 07:49.678
<i>down out of your spinal cord
into your muscles</i>

07:49.780 --> 07:52.081
<i>to where it actually
innervates the tissue.</i>

07:52.183 --> 07:54.216
<i>When that nerve pulls back,</i>

07:54.318 --> 07:57.152
<i>the muscle no longer has
any signaling from the brain,</i>

07:57.254 --> 07:58.334
<i>if you will, on how to move</i>

07:58.389 --> 08:00.889
<i>and your muscles
progressively just atrophy</i>

08:00.991 --> 08:02.291
<i>throughout your entire body,</i>

08:02.393 --> 08:05.760
and that's ultimately
what ends up causing paralysis

08:05.862 --> 08:06.995
and eventually death.

08:07.098 --> 08:09.998
Yet your central nervous system
and your brain is,

08:10.101 --> 08:11.941
for the most part
in most patients, unaffected,

08:12.035 --> 08:14.103
meaning you have
full cognitive function.

08:14.205 --> 08:16.371
So, you know exactly
what's going on around you,

08:16.474 --> 08:18.673
and yet you have
no ability to communicate,

08:18.775 --> 08:19.808
speak, or move.

08:19.910 --> 08:22.578
Is there even a viable
treatment for it right now?

08:22.679 --> 08:25.414
There's no effective treatment
or a cure today.

08:26.250 --> 08:27.316
There's some on the horizons.

08:27.418 --> 08:29.050
We're optimistic
we're gonna get there.

08:29.153 --> 08:33.722
Fanous: <i>ALSTDI received only
$4 out of the $220 million</i>

08:33.823 --> 08:35.591
<i>raised by the Ice Bucket Challenge,</i>

08:35.692 --> 08:37.626
<i>which they immediately channeled</i>

08:37.727 --> 08:39.861
<i>into the most promising drugs.</i>

08:39.962 --> 08:41.597
A big part of our research program

08:41.698 --> 08:44.633
at ALSTDI is pharmacology.

08:44.735 --> 08:47.669
Um, so basically,
that's trying to understand

08:47.771 --> 08:50.905
how therapeutics are working
in a whole animal system.

08:51.008 --> 08:53.208
We focus on mice.

08:53.310 --> 08:55.477
And the way we use the
animals is, number one,

08:55.579 --> 08:57.078
to try to understand the disease,

08:57.181 --> 08:59.014
but also, and maybe more importantly,

08:59.116 --> 09:00.649
we're trying to find treatments.

09:02.719 --> 09:05.053
The first mouse
that we're looking at,

09:05.156 --> 09:08.223
it has the gene in it
that would cause the disease.

09:08.325 --> 09:10.526
But it hasn't had onset yet.

09:10.628 --> 09:12.361
So, you can see he's a little spunky.

09:12.463 --> 09:13.695
Fanous:
So...

09:13.797 --> 09:16.331
how far progressed is this mouse?

09:16.433 --> 09:20.035
This one is probably
about three-quarters

09:20.137 --> 09:22.538
of the way through
its disease progression.

09:23.407 --> 09:25.174
It doesn't have a normal gate

09:25.276 --> 09:26.642
with its hind limbs anymore.

09:26.743 --> 09:28.677
It starts to drag
its toes a little bit.

09:28.779 --> 09:33.482
And ultimately, it won't be able
to use its hind limbs at all.

09:33.584 --> 09:36.851
A lot of our effort
is to test therapeutics

09:36.953 --> 09:39.120
to make this mouse basically have

09:39.223 --> 09:41.256
a better, longer life.

09:41.358 --> 09:43.258
We've tested a lot of drugs...

09:43.360 --> 09:45.160
probably somewhere on the order

09:45.262 --> 09:47.162
of 300 different compounds.

09:47.264 --> 09:49.364
We've had three show efficacy

09:49.466 --> 09:51.132
up until now, and those are

09:51.235 --> 09:52.767
our clinical trial candidates

09:52.869 --> 09:55.270
that we're moving forward right now.

09:55.372 --> 09:57.739
Fanous: <i>Clinical trials
are how drugs are tested</i>

09:57.841 --> 09:59.541
<i>before they're released
to the public.</i>

09:59.643 --> 10:03.144
<i>And because there's currently
no proven treatment for ALS,</i>

10:03.247 --> 10:05.146
<i>these trials have become
the only chance</i>

10:05.249 --> 10:08.750
<i>for patients to access drugs
that could help them.</i>

10:10.887 --> 10:12.787
<i>But for patients like Matt Bollina,</i>

10:12.889 --> 10:14.623
<i>just getting into a trial</i>

10:14.725 --> 10:15.990
<i>is a battle in itself.</i>

10:16.093 --> 10:17.492
Bellina: You don't
want me to push you?

10:17.595 --> 10:20.028
You want to do it all on your own?
That's good.

10:21.432 --> 10:22.764
Bellina: I really think
of, like, the kids

10:22.866 --> 10:24.666
and my wife as the victims
of the disease because,

10:24.768 --> 10:27.808
you know, they're ones that have to pick
up the slack and change their lives.

10:30.841 --> 10:32.374
Bellina:
Buddy, you know I can't.

10:33.844 --> 10:35.377
"Please, Dad."
See, this is, like,

10:35.479 --> 10:36.978
the saddest thing
in the world, isn't it?

10:37.080 --> 10:38.813
He's like, "Please, Dad.
Just come run with me."

10:38.915 --> 10:40.815
And I'm, like...

10:40.917 --> 10:42.451
- Sorry, dude.
- Aww.

10:42.553 --> 10:45.354
You know?
Doesn't that suck?

10:46.690 --> 10:48.123
Bellina: I was flying for the Navy.

10:48.225 --> 10:49.391
I was flying Prowlers.

10:49.493 --> 10:51.159
And then I started having symptoms

10:51.262 --> 10:53.862
and the Navy didn't know what it
was, so they... they grounded me.

10:53.964 --> 10:56.164
They said,
"You can't fly anymore."

10:56.267 --> 10:59.100
<i>Fanous: What was, like, the
plan of action for treatment?</i>

10:59.202 --> 11:01.970
Did you look at experimental stuff?

11:02.072 --> 11:05.440
I had already started
about a year before that,

11:05.542 --> 11:08.343
taking stuff, 'cause I had
a feeling that I had ALS.

11:08.445 --> 11:11.446
So, I had been taking a bunch
of experimental stuff already.

11:11.548 --> 11:12.748
What about clinical trials?

11:12.849 --> 11:14.383
From the day I was diagnosed,

11:14.485 --> 11:17.419
I had already had
too many years worth of tests

11:17.521 --> 11:18.953
to make...
I can't get into any

11:19.055 --> 11:21.790
'cause I have two years since onset.

11:21.892 --> 11:24.393
So, I can't get into
a clinical trial.

11:24.495 --> 11:27.228
Oh, wow. So you were diagnosed,
and you were, like...

11:27.331 --> 11:29.531
Immediately outside
of the exclusion criteria.

11:29.633 --> 11:31.400
It's... it's miserable
because, like,

11:31.502 --> 11:32.934
you want to be part
of the solution too.

11:33.036 --> 11:35.737
Like, you want to be providing data

11:35.839 --> 11:37.372
to the scientists,
but you can't do it.

11:37.474 --> 11:38.607
It's ridiculous.
Like, I...

11:38.709 --> 11:40.875
I'm like, "I... I've been,
you know, on and off

11:40.977 --> 11:42.377
"risking my life for 10 years.

11:42.479 --> 11:45.347
Let me try some drugs that
are gonna potentially help."

11:45.449 --> 11:48.283
I'll take the risk, and I'm...
I'm not scared of it, you know?

11:49.286 --> 11:51.553
Fanous: <i>For most rapidly
fatal diseases,</i>

11:51.655 --> 11:53.588
<i>the standard drug approval process</i>

11:53.691 --> 11:55.424
<i>is a hotly-contested issue</i>

11:55.526 --> 11:57.693
<i>with many
terminally-ill patients</i>

11:57.795 --> 11:59.060
<i>willing to accept the risks</i>

11:59.162 --> 12:01.930
<i>that come with an unapproved drug.</i>

12:03.734 --> 12:05.467
<i>One of the most coveted trials</i>

12:05.569 --> 12:06.768
<i>is called NurOWN.</i>

12:06.870 --> 12:08.403
<i>It slowed down the progression</i>

12:08.505 --> 12:10.905
<i>of the disease in 92% of the patients</i>

12:11.007 --> 12:12.874
<i>who received the full treatment.</i>

12:12.976 --> 12:16.812
The BrainStorm trial at Mayo
accepted 16 patients.

12:16.913 --> 12:19.681
We had almost 1,000 patients
on the waiting list.

12:19.783 --> 12:22.016
Fanous:
<i>Like many ALS patients,</i>

12:22.118 --> 12:24.553
<i>I applied to this trial
and didn't get in.</i>

12:24.655 --> 12:27.188
And push down. Hard, hard,
hard, hard, hard, hard...

12:27.290 --> 12:31.460
Fanous: <i>But Kevin Haas was
one of the very few who did.</i>

12:31.562 --> 12:35.029
When they called and said
that I can have that spot,

12:35.131 --> 12:37.833
um, I just couldn't believe it,
because I thought,

12:37.934 --> 12:40.535
"How many tens of thousands of people

12:40.637 --> 12:44.639
are praying and hoping
for the same chance?"

12:44.742 --> 12:46.708
Dr. Windebank:
<i>One of the important steps</i>

12:46.810 --> 12:49.444
<i>in the BrainStorm trial was that</i>

12:49.546 --> 12:51.480
the cells come out of the bone marrow

12:51.582 --> 12:53.014
and then they're treated

12:53.116 --> 12:55.650
<i>in a way that makes them protective</i>

12:55.753 --> 12:57.151
<i>for nerve cells.</i>

12:57.254 --> 13:00.221
<i>They're kind of enhanced stem cells.</i>

13:00.323 --> 13:02.524
You might feel a little pressure
in your abdomen now, okay?

13:02.626 --> 13:06.528
Dr. Windebank: <i>He'll have a
spinal tap, and that allows us</i>

13:06.630 --> 13:08.630
<i>to inject the stem cells</i>

13:08.732 --> 13:11.700
<i>into the fluid
around his spinal cord.</i>

13:11.802 --> 13:14.736
Sir, are you doing okay?
Yes.

13:14.838 --> 13:17.105
Dr. Windebank: <i>And when you have
an injury anywhere in your body,</i>

13:17.207 --> 13:20.074
<i>those cells will move
out of the bone marrow</i>

13:20.176 --> 13:22.343
<i>and they go to the area
that was injured</i>

13:22.446 --> 13:24.078
<i>and they aid the healing process.</i>

13:24.180 --> 13:26.281
<i>Now, we're taking these healing cells</i>

13:26.383 --> 13:28.283
<i>and we're putting them
into the nervous system.</i>

13:28.385 --> 13:29.951
<i>So, we're putting them into a place</i>

13:30.053 --> 13:31.853
<i>where they don't usually go.</i>

13:33.690 --> 13:35.924
I don't know, it's kind
of, like, surreal.

13:37.795 --> 13:39.895
I remember sending my paperwork

13:39.996 --> 13:41.430
to get into this trial.

13:49.306 --> 13:51.205
I don't feel like crying
on camera today,

13:51.308 --> 13:54.042
so I think we should probably cut.

13:56.980 --> 13:59.648
Fanous: <i>Due to the limited
scope of these trials,</i>

13:59.750 --> 14:01.550
<i>many ALS patients,</i>

14:01.652 --> 14:02.884
<i>like Wissam Mejed,</i>

14:02.986 --> 14:04.152
<i>are left with no other option</i>

14:04.254 --> 14:06.888
<i>than to go abroad to seek treatment.</i>

14:18.368 --> 14:21.903
Bureaucracy and... and all that
is getting in the way right now,

14:22.005 --> 14:24.506
and the FDA is worried about safety.

14:24.608 --> 14:25.874
I mean, the side effect

14:25.976 --> 14:28.376
of ALS is death.

14:28.479 --> 14:30.512
<i>It's not right. I mean,
every day that passes,</i>

14:30.614 --> 14:32.246
<i>he's losing more of himself.</i>

14:32.349 --> 14:34.483
<i>And that goes for every ALS patient.</i>

14:34.585 --> 14:36.184
<i>Yeah, he's willing to take the risk,</i>

14:36.286 --> 14:37.806
which, I mean,
as far as safety goes...

14:37.888 --> 14:38.954
Yeah.

14:44.227 --> 14:45.527
Yeah.

14:49.332 --> 14:52.100
Yeah. If there were options
here in America,

14:52.202 --> 14:54.836
we'd prefer to do it here, but...

14:54.938 --> 14:57.005
there are no options right now.

14:57.107 --> 14:59.240
Fanous: Wissam was forced
to leave the country.

14:59.342 --> 15:02.210
<i>His family and friends raised $30,000</i>

15:02.312 --> 15:03.512
<i>to send him to Lebanon</i>

15:03.614 --> 15:05.547
<i>for an experimental
stem cell treatment</i>

15:05.649 --> 15:08.049
<i>that works in a similar way
as NurOWN.</i>

15:08.151 --> 15:11.019
We're in Beirut and we are on our way

15:11.121 --> 15:13.755
to see Wissam the day before

15:13.857 --> 15:15.724
<i>his big stem-cell procedure.</i>

15:18.194 --> 15:20.729
Fanous: What are you
expectations for tomorrow?

15:31.575 --> 15:33.174
No, that's my goal too.

15:35.913 --> 15:38.613
You can kind of see it
in my left hand.

15:38.715 --> 15:41.315
Also in my right hand
I've atrophied a little bit.

15:46.489 --> 15:48.557
No, I know.

15:48.659 --> 15:51.059
I know.

15:56.166 --> 15:59.601
Fanous: <i>We followed Wissam
as he prepared for treatment.</i>

16:01.104 --> 16:03.271
How are you doing, buddy?
Hey, how are you?

16:03.373 --> 16:04.373
I'm good.

16:04.407 --> 16:05.540
How are you feeling?

16:15.085 --> 16:16.217
Fanous: Oh, yeah.

16:21.291 --> 16:23.357
Hopefully they find a cure soon

16:23.460 --> 16:25.293
before anything happen.

16:28.264 --> 16:29.698
I love him so much.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.566
I don't want to lose him.

16:33.536 --> 16:36.370
Fanous: <i>I wanted to understand
why patients like Wissam</i>

16:36.473 --> 16:38.039
<i>who are severely disabled</i>

16:38.141 --> 16:41.009
<i>are forced to travel
halfway across the world</i>

16:41.111 --> 16:42.611
<i>just to access treatment.</i>

16:42.713 --> 16:45.246
<i>So, I met with
Dr. Janet Woodcock,</i>

16:45.348 --> 16:47.015
<i>the director of the FDA's</i>

16:47.117 --> 16:50.218
<i>Center for Drug Evaluation
and Research.</i>

16:50.320 --> 16:51.920
For a disease like ALS,

16:52.022 --> 16:54.555
where a drug can work for one person

16:54.658 --> 16:56.057
and not necessarily the other

16:56.159 --> 16:58.526
because no two
ALS patients are alike,

16:58.629 --> 17:01.596
what's the harm in just releasing

17:01.698 --> 17:02.931
a drug if it's safe?

17:03.033 --> 17:05.767
First of all,
most drugs have liabilities.

17:05.868 --> 17:07.902
If FDA would just release

17:08.005 --> 17:10.304
a lot of ineffective drugs out there,

17:10.406 --> 17:11.906
we would never find out...

17:12.009 --> 17:14.242
we'd never find out
which ones are harmful,

17:14.344 --> 17:16.711
we'd never find out
which ones are beneficial.

17:16.813 --> 17:20.682
We know this from long
and bitter experience.

17:20.784 --> 17:23.351
But if a patient is willing
to take the risk?

17:23.453 --> 17:26.721
I spoke to a Navy jet pilot
who has the disease,

17:26.823 --> 17:29.758
and he's willing to sign off on it.

17:29.860 --> 17:31.192
I'm willing to sign off on it.

17:31.294 --> 17:34.428
Again, what is the harm
of releasing a drug

17:34.531 --> 17:36.898
that we're willing
to take the risk for?

17:37.000 --> 17:39.233
Well, we don't want to stand between

17:39.335 --> 17:41.836
people trying investigational drugs.

17:41.938 --> 17:45.239
Okay? So, there's
a... large access programs

17:45.341 --> 17:48.877
that FDA runs where we agree that

17:48.979 --> 17:53.148
people who wish to try
investigational products can.

17:53.249 --> 17:56.718
Sign on to that.
We agree with that philosophy.

17:56.820 --> 18:00.722
Fanous: <i>The FDA program is
called Expanded Access,</i>

18:00.824 --> 18:03.825
<i>and it allows patients
to try unapproved drugs.</i>

18:03.927 --> 18:06.861
<i>But in the months it often takes
to complete the paperwork,</i>

18:06.963 --> 18:10.364
<i>ALS patients can lose
their ability to walk,</i>

18:10.466 --> 18:12.801
<i>speak, or breathe on their own.</i>

18:12.903 --> 18:16.905
<i>Exhausted by the process,
patients often give up.</i>

18:17.007 --> 18:19.373
<i>And as we learned from Rich Casey,</i>

18:19.475 --> 18:21.342
<i>the CEO of a company that developed</i>

18:21.444 --> 18:24.846
<i>a highly promising drug
known as NP001,</i>

18:24.948 --> 18:27.648
<i>even innovative drug companies
need revenue</i>

18:27.751 --> 18:29.951
<i>to keep their research going.</i>

18:30.053 --> 18:31.920
<i>But in the US, drug companies are</i>

18:32.022 --> 18:34.055
<i>not allowed to charge
for unapproved drugs,</i>

18:34.157 --> 18:38.626
<i>and that leaves American
patients out in the cold.</i>

18:38.729 --> 18:41.763
Fanous: How many people
in the US are getting your drug

18:41.865 --> 18:43.865
through compassionate use
and how many people

18:43.967 --> 18:45.066
are getting it in Europe?

18:45.168 --> 18:46.267
In the US, nobody.

18:46.369 --> 18:49.104
And the reason it's available
there and not here

18:49.206 --> 18:52.140
is that their laws allow
us to be reimbursed

18:52.242 --> 18:53.507
for our costs.

18:53.610 --> 18:55.643
'Cause we obviously don't have
the financial resources

18:55.746 --> 18:57.045
to just give it away.

18:57.147 --> 18:59.781
And in Europe, we can get
reimbursed for our costs.

18:59.883 --> 19:01.116
Here in the US, you can't.

19:01.218 --> 19:04.585
It's against the law to sell
an... an unapproved drug.

19:04.687 --> 19:07.155
How did it feel when ALS patients

19:07.257 --> 19:09.224
who responded to your
drug came to you

19:09.325 --> 19:10.925
and asked you for the drug?

19:11.027 --> 19:13.027
It's... it's a horrible,
horrible feeling.

19:13.130 --> 19:15.463
I mean, you feel
like less than human.

19:15.565 --> 19:17.932
Because these...
these people were doing well.

19:18.034 --> 19:21.136
And of course I wanted to give
it to 'em, but there was no way.

19:21.238 --> 19:23.671
We... we had no money
at that time.

19:23.774 --> 19:26.174
Um, there was questions about whether
we would survive as a company.

19:26.276 --> 19:28.009
It's a really
heart-wrenching,

19:28.111 --> 19:29.978
you know, discussion
with these patients.

19:30.080 --> 19:33.547
Um, and then of course, you know,
most of them end up dying,

19:33.650 --> 19:35.784
so it's very...
it's tragic, you know?

19:35.886 --> 19:38.987
Fanous: <i>MIT economist Dr.
Andrew Lo thinks</i>

19:39.089 --> 19:41.422
<i>the real issue here is that the FDA's</i>

19:41.524 --> 19:44.759
<i>current approval system treats
all diseases the same.</i>

19:44.861 --> 19:46.995
<i>So, he developed a complex formula</i>

19:47.097 --> 19:50.698
<i>that judges risk
on a disease-by-disease basis.</i>

19:50.801 --> 19:53.168
You're saying that not all diseases

19:53.270 --> 19:54.969
should be treated equally.

19:55.071 --> 19:56.470
ALS is a good example.

19:56.572 --> 19:59.607
Patients might be willing
to take a bigger risk

19:59.709 --> 20:02.710
of getting a drug that may not work

20:02.813 --> 20:07.182
if there is some chance
that that drug might work.

20:07.284 --> 20:09.851
Whereas somebody
who is taking acne medication

20:09.953 --> 20:12.253
may not be willing to take
any kind of a chance

20:12.355 --> 20:13.587
for adverse consequences.

20:13.690 --> 20:16.324
So, the idea is to use
this mathematical framework

20:16.426 --> 20:18.293
that we developed
and to be able to come up

20:18.394 --> 20:20.094
with a single number that says,

20:20.197 --> 20:22.263
"Here, this is the threshold
you ought to use

20:22.365 --> 20:24.532
"for approving drugs
for this disease,

20:24.634 --> 20:27.068
"whereas for this other disease
that's maybe not as serious,

20:27.170 --> 20:29.770
you can use a different threshold,
a more conservative threshold."

20:29.840 --> 20:33.241
Fanous: <i>Lowering that threshold
would not only increase access</i>

20:33.343 --> 20:35.643
<i>for patients, but also incentivize</i>

20:35.745 --> 20:37.045
<i>pharmaceutical companies</i>

20:37.147 --> 20:38.646
<i>to invest in these treatments.</i>

20:38.748 --> 20:41.216
Dr. Lo: <i>Drug companies, when
they think about investing</i>

20:41.318 --> 20:43.117
<i>in a particular
drug development program,</i>

20:43.220 --> 20:45.720
they've got to factor in
how much they're going to put

20:45.822 --> 20:47.788
into it versus how much
they can get out of it.

20:47.891 --> 20:50.825
And if there's a lot of
uncertainty about whether or not

20:50.927 --> 20:52.260
they can get a drug approved,

20:52.362 --> 20:54.462
they may not invest
dollars initially.

20:54.564 --> 20:56.797
If on the other hand,
we change the standards

20:56.900 --> 21:00.034
for these terrible illnesses,
then drug companies are willing

21:00.136 --> 21:03.637
to invest more, we might get
cures sooner rather than later.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.340
Fanous:
<i>If this theory is correct,</i>

21:05.441 --> 21:08.609
<i>the adoption of the technique
would lead to faster approvals</i>

21:08.711 --> 21:09.978
<i>and more trials...</i>

21:10.080 --> 21:12.146
<i>which would open up the possibility</i>

21:12.249 --> 21:16.084
<i>of treating or even curing
a whole host of diseases.</i>

21:16.186 --> 21:18.419
That first effective
treatment for ALS

21:18.521 --> 21:22.190
is going to be the biggest
game-changer we've ever seen.

21:22.292 --> 21:24.525
<i>And ultimately because ALS does look</i>

21:24.627 --> 21:26.827
<i>like other progressive
neurological diseases...</i>

21:26.930 --> 21:28.829
<i>Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,
Huntington's...</i>

21:28.932 --> 21:31.599
<i>some of these drugs
will also work there.</i>

21:31.701 --> 21:34.769
So, the investment that was made
to do this hard work in ALS

21:34.871 --> 21:37.071
is also going to reap
benefits in other patients

21:37.173 --> 21:39.274
with significant unmet needs as well.

21:39.376 --> 21:43.177
Fanous: <i>Without re-evaluating how
we approve drugs for diseases</i>

21:43.280 --> 21:44.879
<i>with no viable treatment,</i>

21:44.981 --> 21:46.680
<i>the only option patients have</i>

21:46.783 --> 21:49.750
<i>is how to spend their remaining days.</i>

22:04.000 --> 22:07.168
Fanous: <i>Eric Valor is
paralyzed from the neck down.</i>

22:07.270 --> 22:10.271
<i>A machine pumps oxygen into his lungs</i>

22:10.373 --> 22:12.240
<i>and eye tracking technology</i>

22:12.342 --> 22:15.009
<i>is his only means of communicating.</i>

22:29.792 --> 22:31.359
I need to feed him.

22:34.064 --> 22:35.763
Ooh.

22:35.865 --> 22:37.731
Because he doesn't burp sometimes,

22:37.834 --> 22:39.533
when we open the tube,

22:39.635 --> 22:41.769
it burps for him.

22:41.871 --> 22:43.004
Fanous:
Three times a day,

22:43.106 --> 22:45.706
<i>Eric receives his meals
through a feeding tube,</i>

22:45.808 --> 22:48.742
<i>which is inserted
directly into his stomach.</i>

22:48.845 --> 22:50.044
Eric's mom:
Look at his arms.

22:50.146 --> 22:52.713
It's just literally skin and bones.

22:52.815 --> 22:56.484
Same with the legs, and so we have
to fight to keep weight on him.

22:57.753 --> 23:00.821
Fanous: Still, Eric is
in constant danger.

23:03.526 --> 23:06.560
<i>When he triggers this alarm
by scrunching his cheek,</i>

23:06.662 --> 23:10.331
<i>it means he's choking
on his own saliva or mucus.</i>

23:11.667 --> 23:14.602
When Eric needs to be
suctioned, it's immediate

23:14.704 --> 23:16.337
because he can choke to death.

23:16.439 --> 23:18.339
Oh, my god.
Because you have to remember,

23:18.441 --> 23:20.941
he can't cough and he can't sneeze,

23:21.044 --> 23:25.446
he can't, uh, hiccup, he can't burp.

23:25.548 --> 23:28.182
That's why the caregivers
are so close.

23:31.954 --> 23:35.056
Eric has to have 24/7 care.

23:35.158 --> 23:38.726
He cannot be left alone at all.

23:38.828 --> 23:40.728
Not even for a minute.

23:42.399 --> 23:44.165
Fanous:
<i>This isn't just Eric.</i>

23:44.267 --> 23:48.702
<i>This is a decision all ALS patients
will eventually have to make.</i>

23:48.804 --> 23:51.539
<i>And this disease is so aggressive,</i>

23:51.641 --> 23:54.075
<i>in the short time
since we filmed with Beth,</i>

23:54.177 --> 23:56.110
<i>she too is faced with the decision</i>

23:56.212 --> 23:58.279
<i>of whether or not
to get a tracheotomy,</i>

23:58.381 --> 24:01.082
<i>lose what's left
of her natural speech,</i>

24:01.184 --> 24:03.884
<i>and indefinitely breathe
through a ventilator.</i>

24:05.955 --> 24:08.156
Doctor: Push it out. Keep
going, keep going, keep going.

24:08.258 --> 24:10.358
Okay.

24:31.647 --> 24:34.615
What are you thinking?
What's going on in your brain?

25:27.103 --> 25:29.069
Fanous: <i>What I learned
from doing this story</i>

25:29.172 --> 25:32.540
<i>is that the FDA's one-size-fits-all
system doesn't work</i>

25:32.642 --> 25:35.943
<i>for neurodegenerative
diseases like ALS.</i>

25:36.045 --> 25:38.579
<i>We need wider and better access</i>

25:38.681 --> 25:41.449
<i>to clinical trials
and experimental medicine</i>

25:41.551 --> 25:43.784
<i>here in the United States.</i>

25:45.455 --> 25:48.389
<i>The Ice Bucket Challenge has proved
people want to find a solution.</i>

25:48.491 --> 25:51.559
<i>And we want to be part
of this process too.</i>

25:51.661 --> 25:56.464
<i>Every 90 minutes, someone with ALS
dies and another is diagnosed.</i>

25:56.566 --> 25:58.232
<i>The FDA needs to understand</i>

25:58.334 --> 26:01.902
<i>that this is urgent
and it needs to act.</i>

26:02.004 --> 26:04.272
<i>ALS slowly tortures its victims,</i>

26:04.374 --> 26:09.577
<i>and all we're asking for is the
fundamental right to save our own lives.</i>
