02:27.480 --> 02:28.960

Oh, no, you've got your big interview.

02:39.160 --> 02:41.640
Barbara's offered to make me some toast.

02:42.960 --> 02:45.160
Oh, nice. Come on then, Tonto. I'll ride shotgun.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.000
Doesn't that make you Tonto?

02:50.320 --> 02:51.960
You'd have thought so.

02:58.960 --> 02:59.960
Oi!

02:59.960 --> 03:01.960
- Adam! 
- What?

03:01.960 --> 03:03.960
- No, him. 
- Ah!

03:03.960 --> 03:05.960
Gets me every time.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.960
- Is that where that Ian Deacon's class is? 
- Er, it should be.

03:09.960 --> 03:13.320
- He's off guest lecturing somewhere.
- The fees that we pay...

03:13.320 --> 03:15.960
- Well, your mum's left this.
- She's not here.

03:15.960 --> 03:18.960
- Well, she should be. Are you sure?
- Yeah, she tends to stick out.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.960
- Like a sore thumb.
- Like a very old thumb.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.160
- Where is she, then?
- I don't know.

03:24.480 --> 03:26.800
Look, are we done here? Cos I've, like, got a life.

03:26.800 --> 03:27.960
Cheeky.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.960
You should've seen her this morning.

03:31.960 --> 03:33.960
Lippy on, all dolled up.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.960
Oh, well, she's skiving, like me. Hm...

03:35.960 --> 03:39.480
Guest lecturing. More like leching. I bet she's with him.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.960
- Professor Deacon. "Ian"! 
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.960
She never shuts up about him. Ian this, Ian that.

03:44.960 --> 03:47.480
She spent more time with him than me at the festival.

03:47.480 --> 03:48.960
I mean, why was he even there?

03:48.960 --> 03:51.960
I thought she said that loads of her uni friends were there.

03:51.960 --> 03:53.960
So she says.

03:53.960 --> 03:55.480
'Hi, this is Jenny. Leave me a message.'

03:55.480 --> 03:56.960
Why is her phone switched off?

03:56.960 --> 03:58.480
Well...

03:58.480 --> 04:00.640
..she's having sex with her tutor.

04:00.640 --> 04:01.960
Ha, irony! Irony! Irony!

04:02.960 --> 04:04.320
Oh...

04:04.320 --> 04:06.480
She's been very distracted lately.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.800
Like her mind's on something else.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.480
Or someone else.

04:10.480 --> 04:11.960
Now where are we going?

04:11.960 --> 04:13.960
To find her.

04:13.960 --> 04:14.960
Sake...!

04:15.960 --> 04:18.160
What's this?

04:18.160 --> 04:19.959
Finding My Family.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.959
- It's basically a stalking app.
- Yeah.

04:21.959 --> 04:23.960
We use it to keep tabs on Chloe.

04:23.960 --> 04:25.960
- Which way?
- Oh...

04:25.960 --> 04:27.960
I don't know about this. I don't feel comfortable.

04:27.960 --> 04:30.960
Then adjust your seat! Now, which way?

04:30.960 --> 04:31.960
Left.

04:38.960 --> 04:40.960
- I said, left.
- All right!

04:59.960 --> 05:02.640
It all went in one ear and out the other last time.

05:02.640 --> 05:04.960
Actually, I'm not sure it even went in.

05:05.960 --> 05:07.320
It's a lot to get your head around.

05:07.320 --> 05:11.480
You have a two-centimetre grade-two ductal cancer.

05:11.480 --> 05:13.960
And we know there's some spread to the lymph nodes.

05:13.960 --> 05:15.960
The good news is it's treatable.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.960
And you're young.

05:18.960 --> 05:20.960
Oh, am I?

05:20.960 --> 05:22.960
That's good. Long time since I've been called that.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.960
You don't have to put that down.

05:26.960 --> 05:27.960
I was writing the other bit.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.960
You are going to need surgery.

05:29.960 --> 05:33.160
As the doctor explained, you've got two options.

05:33.160 --> 05:35.960
One is a mastectomy, the removal of the whole breast.

05:35.960 --> 05:38.960
A lumpectomy is an option for you, too.

05:38.960 --> 05:40.800
It's less invasive,

05:40.800 --> 05:43.960
but you will require radiotherapy after your chemo.

05:43.960 --> 05:46.800
- Would she lose her hair?
- Would I lose my hair?

05:46.800 --> 05:48.960
If you use a cold cap, you might not.

05:48.960 --> 05:51.320
But there are no guarantees.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.960
- This can't be right. 
- Well, it says she's here.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.960
Let's have a look.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.960
Oh, there she is.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.960
And Karen.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.960
Why's Karen at the hospital? Why's Jen with her?

06:16.960 --> 06:18.960
Hey!

06:20.960 --> 06:22.960
- Are you all right?
- I am, yeah.

06:22.960 --> 06:23.960
What...?

06:23.960 --> 06:24.960
- What's going on?
- Come with me.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.960
Just give them a moment.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.960
What's happening? What's she saying to him?

06:30.960 --> 06:33.160
She's telling him she has breast cancer.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.960
- Oh, my God...
- Yeah.

06:40.960 --> 06:42.640
How bad is it?

06:42.640 --> 06:45.320
She has a small tumour on her right breast. They're going to operate.

06:47.480 --> 06:48.960
- Fucking hell...
- I know, I know.

06:48.960 --> 06:52.960
She's going to be fine. She's going to get through this.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.160
Well, it is what it is.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.960
Yep.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.800
I suppose beggars can't be choosers.

07:06.800 --> 07:07.960
Beggars can't be tenants.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.960
Now, I'll need a month's rent up front and another for the deposit.

07:11.960 --> 07:14.960
- That's not a problem?
- No, no. I've got a new job lined up.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.320
I'll have the cash by the end of the week.

07:17.320 --> 07:18.960
Bank transfer will do.

07:19.960 --> 07:20.960
At the end of the week.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.320
- When does this job start?
- The interview's today.

07:26.960 --> 07:29.960
It's in the bag. No worries.

07:33.960 --> 07:35.960
Why didn't you tell me?

07:37.960 --> 07:39.960
I wanted to.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.960
I just didn't want to spoil the festival.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.960
I mean, it was our boy's big moment, wasn't it?

07:46.960 --> 07:48.960
You told Karen.

07:49.960 --> 07:51.960
It's bad enough I've got cancer.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.960
I didn't want to give it to you an' all.

07:54.960 --> 07:58.960
Not till I was sure exactly what we were up against.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.960
Was it Adam, how you found out?

08:02.960 --> 08:05.960
- Karen told him, then he told you.
- Karen never breathed a word.

08:07.960 --> 08:10.960
You'd left your bag, you weren't at uni and nor was Ian.

08:11.960 --> 08:14.960
Ian? What, tutor Ian? What's he got to do with it?

08:16.960 --> 08:18.960
- Oh, it sounds terrible now.
- Oh, hang on...

08:18.960 --> 08:22.960
- You didn't think me and him were at it?
- Well, no, not at it.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.960
No, er...

08:24.960 --> 08:25.960
Well, yeah.

08:25.960 --> 08:29.960
For want of a better phrase. You were all over him at that festival.

08:29.960 --> 08:32.480
I was pissed. He was holding me up.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.159
I love you, Jenny Gifford.

08:44.960 --> 08:46.960
I know you do.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.960
I can't believe it.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.960
I know. Well, it's all too common, I'm afraid, Adam.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.800
Yeah, but Jenny.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.960
- Did she know at the festival?
- Mm.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.960
So, we weren't the only ones keeping secrets.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.960
I keep thinking about our kiss, you know?

09:15.960 --> 09:17.960
- I haven't given it a second thought.
- Really?

09:17.960 --> 09:20.960
Well, it feels so unreal. It's like it didn't even happen.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.960
It happened.

09:23.960 --> 09:26.960
Yeah, we were stoned. It didn't mean anything.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.960
Didn't it?

09:28.960 --> 09:30.960
Did it for you?

09:30.960 --> 09:32.960
Well...

09:34.960 --> 09:36.640
No.

09:36.640 --> 09:37.960
No, it was just festival sex.

09:37.960 --> 09:41.960
- Not even that. 
- A festival kiss while stoned. Meaningless.

09:42.960 --> 09:44.960
It makes you wonder, though, eh? Hey?

09:47.800 --> 09:49.960
Shit! That's my illustrator. I forgot.

09:49.960 --> 09:50.960
- Oh, I'll go.
- No, no, no, no.

09:50.960 --> 09:53.960
I want you to stay. I'll make us lunch.

09:58.960 --> 10:01.960
- Caitlin.
- Hello, babes.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.960
I'm bloody starving!

10:04.960 --> 10:06.960
I keep thinking...

10:06.960 --> 10:07.960
..why these?

10:07.960 --> 10:09.960
They're my best bit.

10:11.960 --> 10:13.960
You have lovely eyes.

10:13.960 --> 10:16.960
Ha! Oh, come on. You love them, too. Always have.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.960
The first month we were together,

10:18.960 --> 10:20.960
all I saw of you was the top of your head.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.800
Well, yeah, I was like a kid in a sweet shop.

10:23.800 --> 10:24.960
Yeah.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.960
Are you sure you wouldn't rather have a mastectomy?

10:27.960 --> 10:29.640
You know, play it safe.

10:29.640 --> 10:32.640
Well, they've said there's the same chance

10:32.640 --> 10:34.960
of making a full recovery either way, so...

10:35.960 --> 10:37.960
Yeah, that's what they say, but...

10:37.960 --> 10:39.480
Oh, I'm not so sure.

10:40.960 --> 10:41.960
It's OK.

10:41.960 --> 10:43.960
They've got medical degrees, Pete.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.960
You haven't even googled it.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.960
And don't, by the way.

10:47.960 --> 10:49.960
All right? You're not allowed.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.000
Within the first minute, I knew it was a complete waste of time.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.960
I mean, you do, don't you?

10:59.960 --> 11:02.640
As soon as you realise they don't look like their photo.

11:02.640 --> 11:04.960
- Did you leg it, then?
- No, I'd ordered a drink.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.960
By the time I'd finished it, he didn't look too bad.

11:06.960 --> 11:07.960
Ha! Then we stayed for three.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.960
- Shags?
- Vodkas.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.960
- What is she like? 
- Oh, she's wicked. Trust me.

11:14.640 --> 11:17.800
- I like that one.
- Yeah? That's my favourite, too, actually.

11:17.800 --> 11:20.320
- And how was the festival?
- It was interesting.

11:20.320 --> 11:22.960
- Mm.
- Full of surprises.

11:22.960 --> 11:24.640
Yep, silent disco. Blew his mind.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.960
- I hope you misbehaved. 
- Oh, she did.

11:26.960 --> 11:27.960
I did not. A bit of weed.

11:27.960 --> 11:29.960
Barely inhaled.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.960
Oh, do you know what?

11:33.960 --> 11:35.960
- What?
- I've got those theatre tickets.

11:36.960 --> 11:38.960
Orla McLaughlin's new play?

11:38.960 --> 11:39.960
Oh, wow!

11:39.960 --> 11:41.960
I thought this was all sold out.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.960
Yeah, well, I know people that know the right people.

11:44.960 --> 11:47.960
The thing is I can't go cos I said I'd help Livvy revise that night.

11:47.960 --> 11:50.960
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, but Adam's free.

11:50.960 --> 11:54.320
- What?
- Thursday night. Are you busy?

11:54.320 --> 11:56.960
No. Well, you are now.

11:56.960 --> 11:58.640
What are we doing?

11:58.640 --> 12:00.960
You're taking me to the theatre, apparently.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.960
Sure.

12:18.960 --> 12:19.960
Hm.

12:19.960 --> 12:22.960
- Clearly, you could do this job in your sleep. 
- Oh...

12:24.640 --> 12:26.960
David's being discreet. We have history.

12:27.960 --> 12:29.960
Zack Aspin.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.960
I interned for you a couple of years ago.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.960
Of course!

12:34.960 --> 12:36.000
Yes, Zack.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.960
Yes...

12:37.960 --> 12:39.960
Yes, I moulded a lot of careers.

12:42.320 --> 12:43.960
Which brings me to my next question.

12:43.960 --> 12:47.960
The financial sector has taken huge strides towards inclusivity.

12:49.160 --> 12:50.960
What about you?

12:50.960 --> 12:54.960
Are your interpersonal skills as honed as your regulatory ones?

12:55.960 --> 12:57.960
Mm. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

12:57.960 --> 12:59.960
Any LGBTQ awareness training?

13:00.960 --> 13:03.960
- Hm?
- Anything in the wake of Me Too?

13:03.960 --> 13:04.960
Ah, yes. Erm...

13:04.960 --> 13:07.960
Well, you see, I have teenage daughters

13:07.960 --> 13:10.960
and they keep me up to speed with all these trends.

13:10.960 --> 13:13.960
Trends?

13:13.960 --> 13:16.960
And I welcome them. I welcome all progress.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.960
It's called a node positive ductal carcinoma.

13:22.960 --> 13:24.960
You googled it.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.960
It sounds scarier than it is.

13:28.960 --> 13:29.960
Is it serious?

13:29.960 --> 13:32.640
Adam, it's breast cancer!

13:33.640 --> 13:35.960
I feel fine. And once I've had the treatment,

13:35.960 --> 13:37.960
I'll be right as rain.

13:37.960 --> 13:39.960
Of course you will.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.960
- So, your mum's decided...
- Well, we've decided.

13:43.960 --> 13:45.960
- We've decided...
- Yeah.

13:45.960 --> 13:47.960
..that she's going to have a lumpectomy.

13:47.960 --> 13:48.960
And what does that mean?

13:50.960 --> 13:53.960
Well, they make an incision in the breast.

13:53.960 --> 13:56.960
I'm sorry, will...? Can you explain this.

13:56.960 --> 13:58.320
OK, look, erm...

13:58.320 --> 14:00.960
Say the yolk is the tumour.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.960
I mean, it's not that big.

14:02.960 --> 14:05.960
But they cut the tumour out and a bit round it.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.960
There you go.

14:08.960 --> 14:10.960
Then they stitch me up...

14:11.960 --> 14:13.960
..and bingo!

14:13.960 --> 14:15.640
Good as new.

14:16.960 --> 14:17.960
Well, sort of.

14:17.960 --> 14:20.960
- Well, that's put me off my tea.
- Look, it's one night in hospital.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.160
Tops.

14:22.160 --> 14:23.960
The recovery will be tough.

14:25.960 --> 14:28.320
- But you're fine, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

14:28.320 --> 14:29.960
Yeah. It's nothing to worry about.

14:31.960 --> 14:33.960
OK, who wants bread?

14:33.960 --> 14:36.800
Oh, I've got this. You take a load off.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.960
- Yeah, good days.
- 'Were they?'

16:06.960 --> 16:09.000
As I recall, you only said two words to me.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.960
I remember what they were.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.960
"One sugar."

16:12.960 --> 16:15.000
Do you still treat interns like your personal barista?

16:15.000 --> 16:16.960
No, I...

16:16.960 --> 16:18.960
I'm much more collegiate.

16:18.960 --> 16:20.960
And I'll happily muck in with my team.

Oh... Go on.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.960
Why are you feeding her nonsense?

17:25.960 --> 17:27.960
Men do overreact to colds.

17:27.960 --> 17:30.960
- You do.
- No! Playing down Jenny's cancer.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.960
Pretending it's no worse than an ingrowing toenail.

17:32.960 --> 17:35.960
I had one of those once. It was bloody painful.

17:36.960 --> 17:39.960
- She's worried, poor mite.
- I know she is!

17:39.960 --> 17:42.960
And I will reassure her. But not by making stuff up.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.800
I'm only trying to help.

17:44.800 --> 17:45.960
Leave the parenting to me.

17:45.960 --> 17:48.800
- I am her dad.
- And I'm her grandma!

17:48.800 --> 17:49.960
And if I can put a smile back on her face,

17:49.960 --> 17:51.960
then that's what I'm going to do.

17:54.960 --> 17:55.960
All right, love?

17:55.960 --> 17:57.640
Here you go. Thanks.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.960
Ellie!

18:07.960 --> 18:10.960
When are you going to start looking after your things!

18:10.960 --> 18:13.960
You're actually talking to yourself.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.960
Yeah, even when you're in the room! Look at the state of this place.

18:16.960 --> 18:19.000
Mum, I know you're upset about Jenny.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.960
- Is that what this is about?
- No!

18:20.960 --> 18:22.960
It's about the fact that your room's a bloody mess!

18:22.960 --> 18:25.960
All you can do is be there for her. Like me and Liv are here for you.

18:25.960 --> 18:28.960
Prove it, then. Tidy your room or the floordrobe gets it!

18:31.640 --> 18:33.960
I was going to get you flowers but then I thought,

18:33.960 --> 18:36.480
"Wise up, it's Jen."

18:36.480 --> 18:38.320
Oh!

18:38.320 --> 18:39.960
Thanks.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.960
You know me so well.

18:42.960 --> 18:43.960
Yes, I do.

18:44.960 --> 18:48.960
So, I've been, er, working on my "concerned" face.

18:48.960 --> 18:49.960
Oh, yeah?

18:52.960 --> 18:55.800
- How are you, Jen?
- I have had...

18:55.800 --> 18:58.800
..so much of that.

18:58.800 --> 19:02.640
Who knew there were so many sympathetic people in the world?

19:02.640 --> 19:04.960
And they've all been in touch.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.960
- Except David. 
- Oh, that'll be his way of dealing with it.

19:06.960 --> 19:08.960
- Denial.
- Mm.

19:08.960 --> 19:10.960
Literally, everybody's got an uplifting story

19:10.960 --> 19:12.960
about a friend who's survived cancer.

19:13.960 --> 19:14.960
How's Pete coping?

19:14.960 --> 19:18.960
By competing with my mum to see who can be the most caring.

19:18.960 --> 19:21.960
It's partly why I didn't want them to know.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.960
Can we please talk about something else?

19:23.960 --> 19:24.960
- Please...
- Yeah.

19:24.960 --> 19:27.960
- Oh, I've got a date tomorrow night.
- Oh, Tinder?

19:27.960 --> 19:30.960
No, no, a friend of Karen's. She set us up.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.960
- Does she not like this woman?
- Yeah, well, you have to wonder.

19:34.960 --> 19:36.960
She's never pushed me towards her pals before.

19:36.960 --> 19:37.960
Oi, oi.

19:37.960 --> 19:39.960
I hope you're not tiring her out.

19:39.960 --> 19:41.960
Oh, no, he's cheering me up.

19:41.960 --> 19:44.640
- Look, he brought me this.
- Oooh, nice.

19:44.640 --> 19:46.960
Well, you can have that when you're better.

19:46.960 --> 19:48.800
Oh, sod that. Let's have it now.

19:50.960 --> 19:52.960
Oh, have you fixed this?

19:53.960 --> 19:55.960
And there was me slagging you off.

19:55.960 --> 19:58.160
Aw...!

19:58.160 --> 19:59.960
Oh, thanks.

20:03.960 --> 20:06.960
Oh, hi. Hello again.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.960
I still want the bedsit, but there's a slight hitch.

20:08.960 --> 20:10.640
Have you brought the deposit?

20:10.640 --> 20:12.960
I didn't get the job. But there's another interview tomorrow.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.960
- So, if you can give me...
- Have you got the money, yes or no?

20:15.960 --> 20:16.960
..perhaps just another 24 hours?

20:17.960 --> 20:19.960
I'm sorry, but, erm...

20:19.960 --> 20:23.960
would you consider taking this as collateral?

20:23.960 --> 20:25.320
Er, it was given to me by my father.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.000
Did he used to holiday in Bangkok?

20:33.000 --> 20:35.960
- Hm?
- It looks like a fake to me.

20:56.960 --> 20:59.960
I was just on the phone to your sister. I gave her your news.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.960
It's two degrees in Winnipeg.

21:04.320 --> 21:07.960
- She was a bit upset.
- About the weather?

21:07.960 --> 21:09.960
Or has her Mountie boyfriend dumped her?

21:09.960 --> 21:12.160
He's offered to pay for her to fly home.

21:12.160 --> 21:14.320
Really?

21:14.320 --> 21:16.960
- I was joking.
- To help you convalesce.

21:16.960 --> 21:18.960
Oh, my God...!

21:18.960 --> 21:20.960
Breast cancer, I can cope with.

21:20.960 --> 21:22.960
But our Sheila...

21:22.960 --> 21:25.000
I told her we could manage.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.160
She said she'd pray instead.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.960
Brilliant.

21:29.960 --> 21:32.960
I remember buying you your first bra.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.000
You were ten.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.960
- We went to British Home Stores.
- Hm.

21:37.960 --> 21:40.960
We had sausage and chips in that horrible cafe.

21:43.960 --> 21:45.960
Are you worried about tomorrow?

21:47.960 --> 21:50.480
Yeah. I am a bit.

21:50.480 --> 21:52.320
Me, too.

21:53.960 --> 21:56.960
Oh, I wish I could swap places with you.

22:00.960 --> 22:02.960
Mum...

22:02.960 --> 22:05.800
I'm sorry I'm putting you through all this.

22:05.800 --> 22:06.960
Oh, it's not your fault, love.

22:06.960 --> 22:08.960
It's not great, though.

22:08.960 --> 22:11.800
At your age, I should be looking after you.

22:12.960 --> 22:15.960
Don't worry, love. Your turn will come.

22:36.710 --> 22:38.910
That's me. Thank you very much.

22:38.910 --> 22:40.710
Excusez-moi.

22:40.710 --> 22:41.710
Sorry.

22:43.710 --> 22:44.910
It's a clarion call.

22:44.910 --> 22:46.710
The voice of a generation.

22:46.710 --> 22:47.710
Oh, forget Delaney.

22:47.710 --> 22:49.910
This should be on the national curriculum.

22:51.550 --> 22:53.710
- Hey. 
- Oh, thank you very much.

22:54.710 --> 22:55.710
What do you think?

22:55.710 --> 22:58.710
Well, they could do with some more staff behind the bar.

22:58.710 --> 23:00.710
- The play. 
- Oh...

23:01.710 --> 23:02.710
It's a clarion call.

23:02.710 --> 23:04.710
The voice of a generation.

23:05.710 --> 23:07.710
- Oh, you think? 
- Oh, yeah.

23:07.710 --> 23:09.710
Oh. I mean, forget...

23:09.710 --> 23:12.710
..someone...

23:12.710 --> 23:14.710
This should be on the national curriculum.

23:14.710 --> 23:16.710
Oooh...

23:16.710 --> 23:18.710
- I think it's a load of old shit. 
- Really?

23:18.710 --> 23:20.710
Mm.

23:20.710 --> 23:22.710
Worse, it's poverty porn.

23:22.710 --> 23:24.710
No.

23:24.710 --> 23:26.070
And there's still another hour to go.

23:26.070 --> 23:27.710
Yes.

23:28.710 --> 23:30.710
- Pub? 
- Mm!

23:30.710 --> 23:31.710
Pub.

23:36.710 --> 23:37.710
So...

23:38.710 --> 23:40.710
- Here we are. 
- Oh, thank you.

23:41.710 --> 23:43.710
So, Karen's told me all about you.

23:43.710 --> 23:45.710
- Really? 
- Uh-uh.

23:45.710 --> 23:48.750
Relax. She gave you a clean bill of health.

23:48.750 --> 23:51.710
Oh, yeah, I've got all my medical certificates...

23:51.710 --> 23:54.710
- ..if you want to see them. 
- Upstairs, framed?

23:59.710 --> 24:02.710
In a bygone age, it'd be, er...etchings.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.710
So...

24:09.710 --> 24:11.710
- I'm, er, just...
- You're going to the toilet?

24:11.710 --> 24:13.710
- Yeah.
- Yes.

24:13.710 --> 24:15.710
Of course you are.

24:21.910 --> 24:24.710
You're asking my advice about women?

24:24.710 --> 24:26.550
Well, unless Jen's there.

24:27.710 --> 24:28.710
How are you?

24:29.750 --> 24:31.710
Go ahead, caller.

24:31.710 --> 24:33.710
I was just wondering whether he's a little shy?

24:33.710 --> 24:35.710
Adam?

24:35.710 --> 24:38.550
Believe me, I have heard many words to describe him,

24:38.550 --> 24:40.710
but shy is not one of them.

24:40.710 --> 24:42.710
- Maybe he just doesn't fancy me, then. 
- 'No, no, no, no.

24:42.710 --> 24:44.710
- 'That doesn't sound like him either.'
- Hm.

24:44.710 --> 24:47.710
It's just moving so fast, you know? Shite play, pub...

24:47.710 --> 24:48.710
'..back to mine.'

24:48.710 --> 24:50.750
Well, we're still waiting for an actual problem.

24:50.750 --> 24:53.750
- I'm not sure if I want to sleep with her.
- Do you not fancy her?

24:53.750 --> 24:55.710
'Have you met me? Of course I fancy her!'

24:55.710 --> 24:57.710
I mean, she's gorgeous, but...

24:57.710 --> 25:00.710
..you know, I don't want to be that bloke any more, into conquests.

25:00.710 --> 25:02.750
So, don't. 'But she's come back.'

25:02.750 --> 25:04.710
She might be expecting...

25:04.710 --> 25:07.550
I was up for this in the pub. I'm not sure about this now.

25:07.550 --> 25:10.710
Well, don't sleep with him. I'm sure he won't mind.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.230
I'm sorry about that.

25:12.230 --> 25:13.710
Hello?

25:13.710 --> 25:15.070
I took a little longer than I intended.

25:15.070 --> 25:16.710
- Number two?
- What?

25:16.710 --> 25:18.710
No, just, it was, erm...

25:18.710 --> 25:21.710
No, it was just a really long, er...wee.

25:22.710 --> 25:24.710
- Who's that?
- Your son?

25:24.710 --> 25:26.710
He's at a friend's tonight.

25:27.710 --> 25:29.710
Number fucking two!

25:29.710 --> 25:30.710
David!

25:30.710 --> 25:32.550
Yes. Come in.

25:32.550 --> 25:34.710
Thanks. I was driving past, saw the lights were on.

25:34.710 --> 25:36.390
No need to explain.

25:36.390 --> 25:37.710
- Erm... Come in, come in.
- Oh, thanks.

25:38.750 --> 25:41.710
Caitlin, this is David, a friend of mine.

25:41.710 --> 25:42.710
- Oh. Hi.
- I'm sorry.

25:42.710 --> 25:45.710
- I didn't know you had company. I'll be going.
-  No, no.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.710
Not on my account. No, stay and have a drink!

25:47.710 --> 25:49.230
- You don't mind, do you?
- No, I'm...

25:49.230 --> 25:51.390
I'm just going to finish that and I'll be on my way.

25:51.390 --> 25:53.390
Oh, well, don't mind if I do.

25:55.230 --> 25:56.910
Ah...

25:58.710 --> 26:00.710
You haven't got any whisky, have you?

26:12.710 --> 26:13.710
Pete?

26:14.710 --> 26:15.710
Pete...

26:19.710 --> 26:22.550
I don't want to turn the light off.

26:24.710 --> 26:27.070
It's the last time I'm going to go to sleep with a matching pair.

26:27.070 --> 26:28.710
Oh...

26:29.550 --> 26:31.550
Oh, you'll still be you, love.

26:32.710 --> 26:34.910
Would you mind giving me a hug, please?

26:35.750 --> 26:37.710
Of course.

27:16.550 --> 27:18.710
- Morning.
- Morning.

27:18.710 --> 27:21.710
- We tied one on last night, eh?
- Oh, yeah, couldn't have driven home.

27:21.710 --> 27:24.710
But, yeah, since Nikki's away, I hope I didn't cramp your style.

27:24.710 --> 27:26.390
No, no, that's fine.

27:26.390 --> 27:28.710
Oh, here, am I going to see you later?

27:28.710 --> 27:31.710
Oh, well, erm... Nikki's not back till tomorrow, so...

27:31.710 --> 27:34.390
- No, no. I mean, at the hospital.
- Hm?

27:34.390 --> 27:36.750
- Haven't you spoken to Pete? 
- Well, I saw I've got a message from him.

27:36.750 --> 27:40.070
- I haven't listened to him yet.
- Jenny's having her operation today.

27:41.710 --> 27:44.070
Jenny? What's wrong with her?

27:47.710 --> 27:49.710
Well, they don't give you much room, do they?

27:51.070 --> 27:52.710
- It's only one night.
- Excuse me.

27:52.710 --> 27:54.710
Is there somewhere my wife can hang her clothes up?

27:54.710 --> 27:56.070
Sorry, mate, that's it.

27:56.070 --> 27:57.910
- Really?
- He's just trying to be useful.

27:57.910 --> 27:59.710
Well, OK. Thanks anyway.

27:59.710 --> 28:02.550
Pete, I'm going to need chocolate.

28:02.550 --> 28:04.710
- Nil by mouth.
- For when I come round.

28:04.710 --> 28:07.710
Do you know what, I saw a vending machine in the corridor.

28:07.710 --> 28:10.710
Yeah. I mean, I'd go myself but...

28:11.710 --> 28:13.390
Great.

28:14.710 --> 28:17.710
Hi. Jennifer? Hello. I'm Dan.

28:17.710 --> 28:18.710
I'm the hospital chaplain.

28:19.710 --> 28:22.710
Christ, you haven't come to read my last rights, have ya?

28:22.710 --> 28:25.390
No, no. I'm, er, I'm doing my rounds.

28:25.390 --> 28:27.750
I'm a listening ear, if you ever need me.

28:29.710 --> 28:31.710
I don't. I've got family and friends for that, ta.

28:32.750 --> 28:34.910
- Well, you're one of the lucky ones.
- Lucky?

28:34.910 --> 28:37.390
I'm not in for my bunions, you know?

28:37.390 --> 28:38.710
I'm so sorry.

28:38.710 --> 28:40.710
- That was clumsy of me.
- Yeah.

28:40.710 --> 28:43.910
Yeah, you might want to work on that with your next customer.

28:45.230 --> 28:46.710
I hope everything goes well.

28:49.710 --> 28:51.710
That was a bit harsh, Jen.

28:53.710 --> 28:55.710
- He was just trying to be helpful.
- Hm.

28:55.710 --> 28:57.710
Everyone is.

28:57.710 --> 28:58.710
Did you get any?

28:58.710 --> 29:00.910
The machine ate my money.

29:04.710 --> 29:06.070
I don't get any benefits for 13 weeks?!

29:06.070 --> 29:09.710
- You did walk out of your last job, Mr Marsden.
-  On principle.

29:10.710 --> 29:13.710
Look, I go for interviews, I'm too experienced,

29:13.710 --> 29:16.550
too expensive, too old.

29:16.550 --> 29:18.390
Maybe I piss people off.

29:18.390 --> 29:20.710
Look, I've been sleeping in my car, for God's sake!

29:20.710 --> 29:23.710
- Any friends or family you can turn to? 
- I shouldn't have to!

29:23.710 --> 29:25.710
The amount of tax I've paid over the years...

29:25.710 --> 29:27.710
Maybe someone who could offer you a bed at least.

29:30.710 --> 29:33.710
Ah, David. What brings you here with a suitcase?

29:35.070 --> 29:36.710
This is so good of you, Adam.

29:36.710 --> 29:39.710
When you see me dressed like this, what do you think?

29:39.710 --> 29:42.070
How long's he going to stay this time?

29:42.070 --> 29:43.750
I can't ask them again.

29:44.750 --> 29:47.910
I'm sorry. Housing can tell you where to find the nearest hostels.

29:58.710 --> 29:59.710
No...

29:59.710 --> 30:00.710
No, that's my car!

30:02.230 --> 30:03.710
Excuse me!

30:05.710 --> 30:06.710
My...

30:07.710 --> 30:09.710
Oh, crap...!

30:11.710 --> 30:12.710
No.

30:14.070 --> 30:15.710
No...

30:22.070 --> 30:23.710
Bye.

30:23.710 --> 30:26.710
- I'll be waiting by your bed.
- No, you won't.

30:26.710 --> 30:28.710
- Adam's going to pick you up.
- Adam? Why?

30:28.710 --> 30:31.070
Cos you need a break, love. Seriously, go and have some fun.

30:32.710 --> 30:34.710
- Good luck.
- See you later.

30:37.710 --> 30:39.710
And get me chocolate!

30:42.710 --> 30:44.070
Love ya!

30:50.710 --> 30:51.710
Shit!

30:53.710 --> 30:55.710
Shit!

30:56.710 --> 30:59.390
- Everything all right?
- Oh...

30:59.390 --> 31:01.710
Erm, a temporary crisis of faith.

31:01.710 --> 31:04.710
Oh, cos the vending machine won't give you chocolate?

31:04.710 --> 31:07.710
Er, well, it was coffee. I think I pressed the wrong button.

31:07.710 --> 31:09.710
Well, I'm on my way to the canteen. Can I buy you one?

31:11.070 --> 31:12.710
Thank you.

31:13.710 --> 31:14.710
That's very kind of you.

31:15.710 --> 31:18.390
- Ta.
- Pleasure.

31:18.390 --> 31:19.710
So...

31:19.710 --> 31:21.710
So, after your friend sent me packing...

31:21.710 --> 31:24.710
- Yeah, I'm really sorry about that.
- Oh, that's OK.

31:25.710 --> 31:27.710
No, I was with a mum and dad

31:27.710 --> 31:31.230
as their eight-month-old was taken off his ventilator.

31:34.230 --> 31:38.550
And we'd made handprints and taken photos with the family.

31:38.550 --> 31:41.710
And we did everything we could to try and ease his passing,

31:41.710 --> 31:43.710
but sometimes the sheer weight of it just...

31:46.710 --> 31:48.710
And then...the vending machine.

31:49.750 --> 31:51.710
God... How do you keep the faith?

31:53.710 --> 31:55.710
By having faith to begin with.

31:56.910 --> 31:59.710
- You must be concerned about your friend.
-  Yeah, I am.

32:00.710 --> 32:03.710
But the stats are on her side. That's what I put my faith in.

32:03.710 --> 32:05.710
Sorry, I don't mean to belittle your belief.

32:05.710 --> 32:09.710
- It's just not something I share.
- Your stats suggest you wouldn't.

32:09.710 --> 32:11.910
Yeah.

32:13.710 --> 32:15.550
What is it you do?

32:15.550 --> 32:17.710
Publishing. Nothing useful.

32:18.710 --> 32:20.710
I used to try and make a difference,

32:20.710 --> 32:22.550
but now I just take old clothes to charity shops.

32:22.550 --> 32:24.710
And I haven't done that for a while, to be fair.

32:24.710 --> 32:27.710
Well, at the Mission, we're always grateful for donations.

32:27.710 --> 32:29.710
You'd be welcome any time.

32:35.230 --> 32:36.710
Oh...!

32:37.710 --> 32:40.390
I hate golf. Why would I want to practise it?

32:40.390 --> 32:41.710
Well...

32:41.710 --> 32:43.390
..so you can get better.

32:45.710 --> 32:48.710
Anyway, the point was to take your mind off Jen.

32:48.710 --> 32:50.710
It'll be two hours now.

32:50.710 --> 32:52.710
It'll be almost finished.

32:52.710 --> 32:53.710
Come on. Have another go. Come on.

32:53.710 --> 32:56.710
So, I want you to clear your mind of all thoughts.

32:56.710 --> 32:58.710
Focus solely on your swing.

33:00.710 --> 33:02.710
Oh... Were you listening to me?

33:02.710 --> 33:05.710
Yes, I was. I'm just crap, that's all!

33:06.710 --> 33:09.390
You know I'm hating this. You said.

33:10.710 --> 33:11.710
No, Jen's cancer.

33:13.710 --> 33:15.710
Oh, yeah, well...it can't be easy for you.

33:15.710 --> 33:19.710
I feel like a spare part. Come on, have another go.

33:19.710 --> 33:22.710
The doctors talk to Jenny in jargon that I don't understand.

33:22.710 --> 33:23.750
Come on.

33:25.710 --> 33:27.070
Hips!

33:27.910 --> 33:30.230
I just wish there was something I could do!

33:30.230 --> 33:32.710
Well, I'm sure your support is really important.

33:32.710 --> 33:34.710
Just not too much, mind, hey?

33:34.710 --> 33:37.710
You need to, erm... You need to give her some space.

33:44.070 --> 33:46.710
I've nothing more to offer!

33:46.710 --> 33:48.710
Nothing!

33:48.710 --> 33:50.710
I just feel so...

33:52.710 --> 33:53.710
..impotent!

33:55.710 --> 33:56.710
Jesus...!

34:01.710 --> 34:03.710
That's further than I hit it.

34:07.050 --> 34:09.210
- Have you got enough pillows? 
- No. It's not the pillow.

34:09.210 --> 34:10.210
It's the bed.

34:12.210 --> 34:13.210
Has the anaesthetic warn off, Jen?

34:16.409 --> 34:18.210
Maybe not.

34:18.210 --> 34:20.210
Jenny!

34:20.210 --> 34:21.210
I'm so sorry I'm late...

34:21.210 --> 34:23.210
- Oh!
- ..and haven't been in touch.

34:23.210 --> 34:25.210
It's just unforgivable.

34:25.210 --> 34:26.210
You're forgiven, Doctor.

34:26.210 --> 34:28.210
Do you want a choccy?

34:29.210 --> 34:32.050
How are you, Jen?

34:35.210 --> 34:37.210
It's the anaesthetic.

34:48.210 --> 34:49.210
Hello.

34:52.050 --> 34:54.210
- I was just thinking about you.
- Oh, yeah?

34:54.210 --> 34:56.210
What was I wearing?

34:56.210 --> 34:58.050
That expression.

34:59.210 --> 35:01.210
Adam...

35:01.210 --> 35:03.210
..can we just go back to how we were before?

35:03.210 --> 35:05.210
Just, er, pretend what happened didn't happen.

35:06.210 --> 35:09.210
- Sure.
- Great.

35:09.210 --> 35:11.210
I hear you're going out with Caitlin again tonight.

35:11.210 --> 35:13.210
- Yeah.
- I'm pleased.

35:15.210 --> 35:16.210
Ah, there she is.

35:16.210 --> 35:20.210
Tell her. Mum read that manuscript you gave me.

35:20.210 --> 35:22.210
- Love Comes Slowly.
- I hope that's all right.

35:22.210 --> 35:24.210
Yeah. What did you think?

35:24.210 --> 35:27.210
Well, that chapter with the threesome.

35:27.210 --> 35:29.210
It's always bothered me, the mechanics.

35:29.210 --> 35:31.410
You'd think there must be one left holding the crisps.

35:31.410 --> 35:34.210
But Nina made it seem so real.

35:34.210 --> 35:36.210
- Oh, good.
- Are you all right, David?

35:36.210 --> 35:38.410
You know, mustn't grumble.

35:38.410 --> 35:41.730
There's always someone worse off than yourself.

35:49.210 --> 35:51.210
Are you all right? Yeah. She seems OK, yeah.

35:51.210 --> 35:53.410
- It's a relief.
- I'm just going to nip into the loo.

35:53.410 --> 35:55.210
- So, you go ahead without me.
- Bye.

35:55.210 --> 35:56.210
- See you, David.
- Cheers, bye.

You've butchered thousands of brain cells. Why?

39:21.210 --> 39:24.050
- Cos I can.
- No, you can't. You're 17.

Urgh...

39:44.890 --> 39:47.210
Hey, son, did you, er, lift 20 quid I left for the cleaner?

39:47.210 --> 39:49.210
- No.
- Sure?

39:49.210 --> 39:50.410
Honestly, I didn't.

39:52.210 --> 39:54.050
Well, maybe I just thought I left it there.

39:54.050 --> 39:56.210
That is weird.

39:58.410 --> 40:01.210
Hang on to those brain cells.

40:31.210 --> 40:33.210
- Hi.
- Hello.

40:33.210 --> 40:35.410
My conscience got the better of me.

40:37.210 --> 40:39.210
- Or maybe you did.
- Thank you.

40:40.210 --> 40:42.210
I thought the church was struggling for numbers.

40:42.210 --> 40:45.210
Ah, well, they can largely be divided into two camps.

40:45.210 --> 40:48.570
The older ones, who are sort of hedging their bets.

40:48.570 --> 40:50.890
And the younger ones?

40:50.890 --> 40:52.210
Hoping to get their kids a school place.

40:52.210 --> 40:54.210
Does that offend you?

40:54.210 --> 40:57.050
In my job, one can't afford to take offence.

40:58.210 --> 41:00.210
- How's your friend, by the way?
- Oh, she comes home today.

41:00.210 --> 41:03.210
- Great. Please send her my best.
- Thanks.

41:05.210 --> 41:07.210
- Well, I'm heading off.
- Publishing.

41:07.210 --> 41:10.210
That's all I know. We didn't really talk about you.

41:10.210 --> 41:12.210
Oh, well, you vicars...

41:12.210 --> 41:14.210
..it's all me, me, me, isn't it?

41:14.210 --> 41:16.210
Well, I do owe you a coffee, so...

41:17.210 --> 41:20.210
..perhaps I could buy you one sometime.

41:20.210 --> 41:22.210
Yeah, I'd like that.

41:22.210 --> 41:24.210
- Great.
- Bye.
- See you.

41:25.210 --> 41:26.210
Bye.

41:36.570 --> 41:39.210
- Hey!
- You're home!

41:41.050 --> 41:42.210
Oh...

41:42.210 --> 41:43.210
Oh, just so you know...

41:43.210 --> 41:44.210
Ow!

41:44.210 --> 41:46.410
- A chippy tea to celebrate!
- Oh, let me take this.

41:46.410 --> 41:48.210
No, I've got this.

41:48.210 --> 41:50.210
- Wait, stop.
- I can do it.

41:50.210 --> 41:52.210
- Are you all right?
- I will be.

41:52.210 --> 41:54.210
Back where you belong, in the bosom of your family.

41:54.210 --> 41:57.210
Can we have one meal without the talk of boobs, please?

41:58.210 --> 42:00.210
- Do you want a brew?
- Yeah.

42:02.210 --> 42:03.210
Oh...

42:04.210 --> 42:06.210
Hm.

42:12.210 --> 42:14.210
My stripy jumper! That was my favourite!

42:14.210 --> 42:17.210
I did warn you not to leave it on the floor.

42:17.210 --> 42:19.210
That's how I know where it is! You're unbelievable!

42:20.730 --> 42:22.210
You knew it was her favourite.

42:22.210 --> 42:24.210
No, I couldn't give it away.

42:25.210 --> 42:26.210
It wasn't washed.

42:27.210 --> 42:29.210
Let her stew a bit.

42:36.730 --> 42:38.210
Oh, spot on.

42:38.210 --> 42:40.210
It could've been made for you.

42:44.210 --> 42:46.050
Oh, crumbs...

42:51.210 --> 42:53.210
Are you sorted for a bed tonight?

42:54.210 --> 42:56.210
Oh, I've picked up a leaflet about the hostels.

42:56.210 --> 42:58.210
Well, if you don't have a place yet, you won't get one.

42:58.210 --> 43:00.570
- You need to get your name down early. 
- Oh, right.

43:00.570 --> 43:02.210
I'll be fine for now, thank you.

43:02.210 --> 43:04.210
OK.

43:19.210 --> 43:22.210
I don't get it. What's so scary about a cucumber?

43:22.210 --> 43:24.210
The cats think they're snakes. Look...

43:28.210 --> 43:30.210
Chloe?

43:30.210 --> 43:32.890
What have I told you? Your mum's meant to be resting.

43:32.890 --> 43:34.210
You've got homework to do.

43:34.210 --> 43:37.210
- What's with all this noise? Have you woken her up?
-  No.

43:37.210 --> 43:39.210
I can't sleep any more, anyway.

43:39.210 --> 43:40.210
Well, you're too hot, probably.

43:40.210 --> 43:43.210
- I told you this throw was a bad idea.
-  No, she likes it.

43:43.210 --> 43:45.210
- Wait, enough!
- Give it here.

43:45.210 --> 43:46.890
- Stop!
- Oh, what are you doing?

43:46.890 --> 43:48.210
- Pete, stop her.
- Jenny, no, no.

43:48.210 --> 43:50.210
No, no, no, no! Listen...

43:50.210 --> 43:53.210
I know you mean well, but back off, the pair of ya.

43:53.210 --> 43:56.210
- But we care about you.
- We're just trying to help.

43:56.210 --> 43:58.210
I don't want you to wrap me in cotton wool.

43:58.210 --> 44:00.250
If I fall, fine.

44:00.250 --> 44:02.210
Let me.

44:02.210 --> 44:05.050
Just...be there to help me up.

44:05.050 --> 44:06.210
OK?

44:06.210 --> 44:09.210
Now, go and put the washing on or something.

44:10.210 --> 44:12.210
I'll go and do it now.

44:12.210 --> 44:14.210
And I'll help separate the colours.

44:14.210 --> 44:15.890
I'll put the powder in the loader.

44:15.890 --> 44:17.210
Shall I do fabric conditioner?

44:18.570 --> 44:20.210
Oh, God help me...

44:22.730 --> 44:25.210
You've a admirer.

44:25.210 --> 44:27.210
I don't know about that. He's invited me for coffee.

44:27.210 --> 44:29.210
You have an admirer.

44:29.210 --> 44:30.890
He's a vicar.

44:30.890 --> 44:33.210
- Seriously?
- 'I know.

44:33.210 --> 44:35.210
'Like, how's that going to work?'

44:35.210 --> 44:37.890
So, you like him?

44:37.890 --> 44:39.210
'Yeah, I do. He's interesting.'

44:40.210 --> 44:42.210
- He's quite attractive.
- And a vicar.

44:42.210 --> 44:44.210
Something to tick off the bucket list.

44:45.890 --> 44:48.210
- Oh, God... 
- Don't you just wish you could skip the dating

44:48.210 --> 44:51.210
and fast-forward to the part where you're curled up on the sofa

44:51.210 --> 44:52.890
watching boxsets together?

44:52.890 --> 44:55.210
I quite like the dating, the courting.

44:55.210 --> 44:57.210
The thrill of the chase.

44:57.210 --> 44:58.210
'Yeah, of course you do.

44:58.210 --> 45:00.210
'How are things going with Caitlin?'

45:00.210 --> 45:02.210
Mm, good.

45:02.210 --> 45:03.570
Say, hi.

45:03.570 --> 45:06.210
She says, hi.

45:06.210 --> 45:08.210
'All right, then, I'll let you get back to it.'

45:08.210 --> 45:09.890
How did you guess?

45:11.210 --> 45:13.210
Cos it's you.

45:14.210 --> 45:16.210
- 'Night.'
- Goodnight.
