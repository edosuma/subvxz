00:00.201 --> 00:01.233
<i>Like it or not,</i>

00:01.234 --> 00:04.179
<i>we live in an age of dynasties.</i>

00:04.267 --> 00:06.570
<i>Who else can you trust to
run the family business...</i>

00:06.605 --> 00:08.603
<i>except family?</i>

00:08.605 --> 00:09.704
<i>I'm a Carrington.</i>

00:09.706 --> 00:11.472
<i>And our business is literally power.</i>

00:12.345 --> 00:13.641
<i>If you drove a car today,</i>

00:13.676 --> 00:14.675
<i>charged your cell phone,</i>

00:14.677 --> 00:16.677
<i>or made breakfast, chances are</i>

00:16.679 --> 00:18.579
<i>Carrington Atlantic had
something to do with it.</i>

00:19.104 --> 00:22.083
<i>For generations,
this has been our dynasty.</i>

00:22.085 --> 00:25.486
<i>And today, my father gives it to me.</i>

00:25.488 --> 00:26.654
<i>Finally.</i>

00:29.951 --> 00:31.058
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

00:31.060 --> 00:32.860
<i>I'm young.</i>

00:33.675 --> 00:35.885
<i>I haven't earned words like "finally."</i>

00:36.353 --> 00:37.598
<i>But don't underestimate me.</i>

00:38.236 --> 00:40.835
<i>Like these mansplainers in Denver did.</i>

00:41.938 --> 00:45.206
It's complicated, but,
basically, this company,

00:45.208 --> 00:47.308
Windbriar, overexpanded.

00:47.310 --> 00:50.278
We're talking nearly
a billion in assets.

00:50.280 --> 00:53.180
<i>This is why I deserve that promotion.</i>

00:53.182 --> 00:55.049
<i>Every day, I take one man's dirt</i>

00:55.051 --> 00:57.218
<i>and turn it into diamonds.</i>

00:59.088 --> 01:00.988
<i>And digging up insider
info is even easier</i>

01:00.990 --> 01:03.190
<i>when they assume you
work for the airline.</i>

01:03.192 --> 01:04.792
Way to scare away the stewardess.

01:04.794 --> 01:06.928
<i>Instead of owning the plane.</i>

01:11.575 --> 01:14.001
Look into what Windbriar
wants for an opening bid,

01:14.003 --> 01:16.237
not just the operation, the land.

01:16.239 --> 01:18.873
Also, find out who employs
the D-bags who leaked it.

01:18.875 --> 01:22.143
They should learn my name
before they're fired.

01:23.046 --> 01:24.779
<i>I know a lot about being overlooked.</i>

01:24.781 --> 01:26.314
<i>Our father wanted my brother Steven</i>

01:26.316 --> 01:27.782
<i>to follow in his footsteps.</i>

01:27.784 --> 01:30.918
<i>And I wasn't the most
obvious candidate at first.</i>

01:30.920 --> 01:32.253
♪ Yo, fellas, you want some? ♪

01:32.255 --> 01:33.521
♪ Come and get some ♪

01:33.523 --> 01:35.389
♪ Doper than dope rhymes
so I can hit some... ♪

01:35.391 --> 01:38.092
<i>But as it turned out,
Steven had his own path to take.</i>

01:38.094 --> 01:40.361
- ♪ Lips, hips and thighs. ♪
- Fallon!

01:40.363 --> 01:42.677
<i>A rocky trail to the middle of nowhere.</i>

01:42.712 --> 01:45.167
- <i>As far as he could get from my father.</i>
- _

01:46.135 --> 01:47.702
- He started it.
- Dad would beg to differ.

01:47.704 --> 01:50.204
He was literally planning to
frack a native burial ground.

01:50.206 --> 01:51.606
Okay? That sounds like a joke.

01:51.608 --> 01:54.108
Okay, well, there was nothing
funny about the $600 million

01:54.110 --> 01:55.576
your protest cost him.

01:55.578 --> 01:57.812
Face it, you'll never
see eye to eye on this,

01:57.814 --> 01:59.947
but there's something you'll
always be able to agree on,

01:59.949 --> 02:01.415
and that is your love for me.

02:02.071 --> 02:03.351
Come home.

02:03.353 --> 02:05.286
- <i>If you haven't figured it out already,</i>
- _

02:05.288 --> 02:06.954
<i>my father's kind of old-school.</i>

02:06.956 --> 02:11.359
<i>He made his fortune doing deals with
old white guys at private clubs.</i>

02:11.361 --> 02:15.830
<i>And he refuses to accept the
world around him is changing.</i>

02:15.832 --> 02:19.233
Ms. Flores, you were a voice of dissent?

02:19.235 --> 02:20.968
Ryan said you had thoughts about

02:20.970 --> 02:23.371
- about his investor video.
- The presentation should talk about

02:23.373 --> 02:25.339
how we're training the
engineers of the future

02:25.341 --> 02:28.009
by sponsoring STEM
classes in public schools.

02:28.011 --> 02:29.844
Or developing worker safety programs...

02:29.846 --> 02:31.312
Now, this is the part when I say,

02:31.314 --> 02:33.314
"Then let's talk about that."

02:33.316 --> 02:34.949
And then you try to embarrass me

02:34.951 --> 02:36.651
in front of the entire
room because we don't even

02:36.653 --> 02:38.019
have those programs.

02:38.021 --> 02:40.588
What you're really trying to say,
Ms. Flores, is

02:40.590 --> 02:42.957
that it's not just this
video that's out of touch,

02:42.959 --> 02:43.891
it's me.

02:43.893 --> 02:46.694
Not you, the company.

02:46.696 --> 02:48.429
Same thing.

02:50.237 --> 02:52.533
<i>As for the idea
that the future is female?</i>

02:55.071 --> 02:58.172
<i>Well, Daddy likes to say,
"The future's not here yet."</i>

02:59.042 --> 03:00.641
<i>But he's wrong about that.</i>

03:03.446 --> 03:04.578
Welcome home.

03:04.580 --> 03:06.614
How was Denver?

03:06.616 --> 03:07.915
I missed the heat.

03:08.683 --> 03:09.450
Trust me,

03:09.452 --> 03:11.752
it wasn't as hot without you here.

03:12.655 --> 03:14.155
Straight to the manor?

03:14.157 --> 03:16.023
I'm open to a detour.

03:20.730 --> 03:22.029
<i>Ms. Flores?</i>

03:22.799 --> 03:25.466
Mr. Carrington asked to see you.

03:25.468 --> 03:27.334
Can't say I'm surprised.

03:27.336 --> 03:28.569
But he already left.

03:28.571 --> 03:30.871
He wants you to meet
him at his home office.

03:32.275 --> 03:33.574
Do you think he heard
about those accounts

03:33.576 --> 03:35.109
I poached in Dallas?

03:35.111 --> 03:37.078
Or that Exxon Mobil tried to poach me?

03:37.080 --> 03:39.163
I mean, he must know I'm invaluable.

03:39.780 --> 03:42.450
Can we stop talking about
your father for a minute?

03:42.452 --> 03:44.285
Kind of makes it hard to concentrate.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.721
I'm sorry.

03:46.723 --> 03:48.422
It's just...

03:48.424 --> 03:51.158
I've spent five years
preparing for this.

03:52.128 --> 03:55.730
What if he doesn't give you
this job, Fallon?

03:55.732 --> 03:57.214
He always disappoints you.

03:57.249 --> 03:58.866
You know what's disappointing?

03:59.801 --> 04:01.135
All this talking.

04:03.000 --> 04:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:36.506 --> 04:38.072
Ms. Flores.

04:38.074 --> 04:39.240
Come in.

04:45.354 --> 04:46.747
He's waiting in the study.

04:54.023 --> 04:55.823
Alice said you wanted to see me?

04:57.727 --> 05:00.194
If you're hoping to hear how
Ryan and I worked it out,

05:00.196 --> 05:01.195
we didn't.

05:01.197 --> 05:03.130
Why would you? I fired him.

05:03.132 --> 05:04.698
Because of me?

05:04.700 --> 05:05.766
Because we need new ideas.

05:05.768 --> 05:08.636
I assume you have project
proposals for the STEM thing?

05:08.638 --> 05:10.004
The worker safety program?

05:10.006 --> 05:12.273
I may have something
drafted on my laptop.

05:13.138 --> 05:15.075
Two steps ahead.

05:15.077 --> 05:16.043
Always.

05:16.045 --> 05:17.978
Have it on my desk first thing Monday.

05:17.980 --> 05:19.313
Is that all?

05:20.049 --> 05:21.416
Not quite.

05:23.052 --> 05:24.590
Oh, Bo!

05:24.887 --> 05:27.477
Oh, I'm home. I'm home.

05:29.059 --> 05:30.257
And so are you.

05:30.259 --> 05:32.893
I can't believe that old Cessna
actually made it over the ocean.

05:32.895 --> 05:35.029
I can't believe you just spent
the median household income

05:35.031 --> 05:35.996
on jet fuel.

05:35.998 --> 05:37.298
Fresh-baked cookies are worth it.

05:38.801 --> 05:41.502
When the revolution happens,
it'll be your head they come for first.

05:41.504 --> 05:43.604
Oh, I'll be sure to get my hair done.

05:43.606 --> 05:44.939
Sooner the better.

05:44.941 --> 05:46.073
How did I beat you back here?

05:46.075 --> 05:47.408
Um...

05:47.410 --> 05:49.176
I took the scenic route.

05:50.046 --> 05:52.179
Thank you for coming home for me.

05:52.181 --> 05:53.981
Actually, Dad called me after you did.

05:53.983 --> 05:54.815
I know.

05:54.817 --> 05:56.255
Maybe he's dying.

05:56.886 --> 05:58.452
Fallon, Steven?

05:59.265 --> 06:01.989
I didn't know your father
was expecting you two.

06:01.991 --> 06:02.990
Especially you.

06:03.598 --> 06:05.092
I come for the hospitality.

06:05.094 --> 06:06.293
Dad asked us.

06:06.295 --> 06:08.162
He said you never responded.

06:08.164 --> 06:10.397
- This is our response.
- Where is he?

06:10.399 --> 06:11.699
In a meeting.

06:12.848 --> 06:14.368
Fallon, don't...

06:15.671 --> 06:16.937
Wait.

06:18.674 --> 06:21.575
Hey, guess who's... Oh, my God!

06:22.403 --> 06:23.577
What the hell are you doing here?

06:23.579 --> 06:25.079
Who the hell are you doing here?

06:25.081 --> 06:26.614
I think she works for the company.

06:26.616 --> 06:28.082
Whoa, these are your...

06:28.084 --> 06:29.750
- Hi, Daddy.
- ...your children.

06:29.752 --> 06:31.218
- And you are?
- Looking for a promotion.

06:31.220 --> 06:32.319
Fallon.

06:32.321 --> 06:33.721
This obviously isn't how

06:33.723 --> 06:35.322
I intended for you all to meet, but...

06:35.324 --> 06:37.458
Why would we be meeting at all?

06:37.460 --> 06:40.261
Fallon, Steven,

06:40.263 --> 06:41.595
this is Cristal.

06:41.597 --> 06:43.097
My fiancée.

06:58.655 --> 07:00.688
So this is a nice surprise.

07:00.690 --> 07:02.757
I'm usually the one that makes
things awkward around here.

07:03.335 --> 07:06.060
- Well, I'm happy to relieve you of that burden.
- Why didn't you call me back?

07:06.062 --> 07:07.728
If I had any idea you were coming, I...

07:07.730 --> 07:09.263
I'm not sure why you're so surprised.

07:09.265 --> 07:10.531
You asked us to come back...

07:10.533 --> 07:12.066
When was the last time you
did anything I asked you to?

07:12.068 --> 07:13.401
Oh, Dad.

07:13.403 --> 07:14.669
Stop acting as if you don't bang

07:14.671 --> 07:16.604
all of your girlfriends in front of us.

07:18.203 --> 07:19.907
I've heard so much about you two.

07:19.909 --> 07:21.509
And we've heard nothing about you.

07:21.511 --> 07:22.944
Well, that's why I called.

07:22.946 --> 07:24.245
I want you to get to know Cristal

07:24.247 --> 07:25.947
before the engagement party this Sunday.

07:25.949 --> 07:27.615
So you've told other people?

07:27.617 --> 07:29.317
Other people called me back.

07:30.186 --> 07:31.219
It happened so fast.

07:32.405 --> 07:33.821
Cristal's been an associate in PR

07:33.823 --> 07:35.189
for four years now.

07:35.191 --> 07:38.826
But she's only recently
caught my attention.

07:38.828 --> 07:40.161
She hasn't let go.

07:41.431 --> 07:43.097
At least now we know what happened

07:43.099 --> 07:44.999
to Kim Kardashian's stolen ring.

07:45.001 --> 07:46.167
- Fallon.
- Yeah.

07:46.169 --> 07:47.602
That's ridiculous,
they arrested those guys.

07:47.604 --> 07:48.636
You,

07:48.638 --> 07:50.505
- not helping.
- You're right, Daddy.

07:50.507 --> 07:51.639
There's no point in getting upset.

07:51.641 --> 07:52.940
It's only an engagement.

07:53.810 --> 07:55.476
Anything can happen.

07:57.691 --> 07:59.614
I'm sorry.

07:59.616 --> 08:01.115
Let me go talk to her.

08:08.658 --> 08:10.391
Forgive my sister.

08:10.393 --> 08:12.026
She thought she was getting a promotion,

08:12.028 --> 08:13.607
not a stepmother.

08:14.027 --> 08:14.962
And what did you think?

08:16.073 --> 08:18.165
That I was getting an apology.

08:18.167 --> 08:20.034
I'm not sure which of us was more wrong.

08:20.036 --> 08:22.036
He really didn't mention we were dating?

08:22.652 --> 08:24.038
He stopped bragging
about his girlfriends

08:24.040 --> 08:26.207
once he realized it wouldn't
make me any straighter.

08:28.678 --> 08:30.545
Whose idea was it to call me?

08:30.547 --> 08:31.913
I wanted to meet you.

08:32.749 --> 08:33.981
To see how Blake Carrington

08:33.982 --> 08:35.850
could spawn a bleeding-heart liberal?

08:35.852 --> 08:37.284
No.

08:37.287 --> 08:39.053
I told him family is everything.

08:39.054 --> 08:41.289
And when things get tough,
you don't give up,

08:41.291 --> 08:43.157
you fight harder.

08:43.159 --> 08:45.092
And you think he actually believes that?

08:46.022 --> 08:47.495
Well, he called you, didn't he?

08:49.983 --> 08:50.865
Fallon...

08:50.867 --> 08:52.233
I could only imagine what Mom would say

08:52.235 --> 08:53.601
about your child bride.

08:53.603 --> 08:57.104
Your mother forfeited the right
to an opinion a long time ago.

08:57.106 --> 08:59.006
If I had called you and
told you over the phone,

08:59.008 --> 09:00.641
would you have come home?

09:01.477 --> 09:03.477
Well, why'd you think I called?

09:05.636 --> 09:06.347
Oh.

09:06.349 --> 09:08.349
You heard I was hiring a new C.O.O.

09:08.351 --> 09:11.118
You were my age when your
father handed you the company.

09:11.120 --> 09:13.020
He didn't hand it to me, I earned it.

09:14.524 --> 09:16.290
Did you know Windbriar
Energy is going under?

09:17.004 --> 09:18.926
Today at the airport,
these two guys were bragging about

09:18.928 --> 09:20.795
their plan to save it,
right in front of me.

09:20.797 --> 09:22.063
They didn't know who you were?

09:22.065 --> 09:23.631
They thought I was a flight attendant.

09:23.633 --> 09:25.066
Well, they underestimated you.

09:25.068 --> 09:26.734
I don't, and that's why I made you

09:26.736 --> 09:28.202
head of acquisitions last year.

09:28.204 --> 09:30.705
Now can we please stop talking business?

09:30.707 --> 09:33.808
This weekend is a new
chapter for our family.

09:33.810 --> 09:36.777
And you and Cristal are the two
most important women in my life.

09:38.114 --> 09:40.448
- Bet you have a lot more in common than you think.
- Hmm.

09:41.106 --> 09:42.550
I wouldn't take that bet.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.019
You're not gonna scare
this one off, Fallon.

09:46.584 --> 09:48.389
We're getting married.

09:51.628 --> 09:52.860
Uh-huh.

09:54.608 --> 09:56.631
He swore he'd never marry again.

09:56.633 --> 09:58.733
- Eh, people change.
- Not on their own.

09:59.862 --> 10:01.702
He didn't even react
to my Windbriar tip.

10:01.704 --> 10:04.405
Because that was your idea and not his.

10:06.009 --> 10:08.542
Did you know he just entered
a bidding war for the Braves?

10:08.544 --> 10:09.977
He hates baseball.

10:09.979 --> 10:11.545
Not as much as he hates Jeff Colby,

10:11.547 --> 10:13.047
who he is bidding against.

10:13.049 --> 10:16.117
You're kidding.

10:16.119 --> 10:17.618
What do you want for that?

10:18.454 --> 10:19.553
You're gonna help me

10:19.555 --> 10:21.422
and not ask for anything in return?

10:21.424 --> 10:22.523
I don't need anything.

10:22.525 --> 10:23.557
You live in a barn.

10:23.559 --> 10:25.259
It's a stable house.

10:25.261 --> 10:27.194
You drive an old white
guy around all day.

10:27.196 --> 10:29.230
He pays me $200K a year,

10:29.232 --> 10:31.032
and I'm banging his daughter.

10:33.202 --> 10:34.535
Fine.

10:34.537 --> 10:36.504
Then tell me what else you've
learned from the front seat.

10:36.506 --> 10:38.305
Who is Cristal Flores?

10:38.307 --> 10:40.374
Other than a woman
who drives herself, don't know.

10:40.376 --> 10:43.678
Well, my dad said get to know her,

10:43.680 --> 10:45.546
so that's what I need you to do.

10:49.552 --> 10:52.720
I would say there's
no way that's real...

10:52.722 --> 10:55.156
But except it's Blake effing Carrington.

10:55.158 --> 10:58.140
You guys have only been together for,
what, three months?

10:58.175 --> 10:58.626
Four.

10:58.628 --> 11:01.429
I didn't even know it
was over with Matthew.

11:01.431 --> 11:03.464
I'm not sure Matthew does, either.

11:03.466 --> 11:04.699
You have to tell him.

11:04.701 --> 11:05.966
She doesn't owe him anything.

11:05.968 --> 11:08.102
He was never leaving Claudia.

11:08.104 --> 11:11.405
Well, that's because he
didn't want her to be alone...

11:11.407 --> 11:13.674
which is exactly why I loved him.

11:13.676 --> 11:15.342
Point is, you were in love.

11:15.344 --> 11:16.510
You can't just give up on that.

11:16.512 --> 11:17.745
I'm sure you can.

11:17.747 --> 11:19.346
I did, and let me tell you,

11:19.348 --> 11:21.649
there have been wild
advances in vibrator tech.

11:21.651 --> 11:23.751
Guys, I love Blake.

11:23.753 --> 11:25.619
Okay? I do.

11:25.621 --> 11:28.222
He's smart, he's worldly, challenging.

11:28.224 --> 11:30.991
He likes that I'm challenging
and that I can't be bought.

11:30.993 --> 11:33.094
I have champagne for Cristal.

11:33.096 --> 11:35.529
The note said Mr.
Carrington had it sent over

11:35.531 --> 11:36.864
for your celebration.

11:36.866 --> 11:38.799
There's a crate full of it.

11:38.801 --> 11:40.067
Send it back, please.

11:40.069 --> 11:41.035
Leave it.

11:41.037 --> 11:42.670
She can't be bought. I can.

11:44.095 --> 11:46.240
Thank you.

11:46.826 --> 11:50.311
You know I just want you to be happy.

11:50.313 --> 11:51.612
If you're sure about Blake,

11:51.614 --> 11:53.581
I won't bring up Matthew's name again.

11:58.855 --> 12:01.388
It's good to have you back home.

12:03.382 --> 12:04.825
Thanks.

12:04.827 --> 12:06.827
See how long it takes you
to kick me out this time.

12:06.829 --> 12:09.096
I didn't kick you out. You left.

12:10.266 --> 12:11.832
But that's behind us,

12:11.834 --> 12:13.768
and I hope you'll stay
as long as you like.

12:18.908 --> 12:20.407
Cristal seems nice.

12:21.811 --> 12:24.078
That wasn't sarcasm.

12:24.080 --> 12:25.179
I really like her.

12:25.973 --> 12:27.214
Me, too.

12:30.219 --> 12:32.153
You know, I have to confess.

12:32.155 --> 12:34.321
I didn't just call you here to meet her.

12:34.323 --> 12:36.891
I came across a lead that
I'd like you to pursue.

12:36.893 --> 12:38.559
- Dad, can we not...?
- What?

12:38.561 --> 12:40.060
You said you'd never return

12:40.062 --> 12:42.663
to Carrington Atlantic unless
we balanced our portfolio

12:42.665 --> 12:44.431
with 50% renewable energy.

12:44.433 --> 12:46.500
- And you laughed in my face.
- I shouldn't have.

12:46.502 --> 12:48.269
Bill Prather

12:48.271 --> 12:50.471
has a massive site for
sale up in Floyd County.

12:50.473 --> 12:53.107
I'd like you to meet
with him on my behalf.

12:53.109 --> 12:54.208
Given your common interests,

12:54.210 --> 12:56.610
I think you'd be more persuasive.

12:58.614 --> 13:00.447
What's the company called?

13:02.285 --> 13:04.518
Windbriar.

13:04.520 --> 13:06.153
You heard of it?

13:07.924 --> 13:10.724
All right, guys. See you tomorrow.

13:15.665 --> 13:17.998
Matthew.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.301
Can we talk?

13:26.042 --> 13:28.309
Why'd you really come down here?

13:29.396 --> 13:31.011
You don't owe me this.

13:31.836 --> 13:34.882
I wanted you to hear it from me,

13:34.884 --> 13:38.252
so there'd be no... confusion.

13:39.851 --> 13:41.922
Yeah.

13:41.924 --> 13:45.092
And being here alone with you,
that's not confusing at all.

13:48.564 --> 13:50.364
Just tell me what you want me to say.

13:52.568 --> 13:54.835
Good-bye.

14:23.397 --> 14:26.432
You have the best bed ever.

14:26.444 --> 14:28.444
Oh, it's better with you in it.

14:31.449 --> 14:33.115
You were in late last night.

14:34.472 --> 14:37.186
I always lose track of time
when I'm with my girlfriends.

14:38.439 --> 14:39.589
Maybe if you hadn't have sent us

14:39.591 --> 14:41.858
that crate of champagne.

14:41.860 --> 14:44.027
Hey, hey, where are you going?

14:44.029 --> 14:46.963
Didn't you read that itinerary
Anders sent us last night?

14:46.965 --> 14:50.233
10:00 a.m.: engagement photos,
topiary garden.

14:50.235 --> 14:51.567
Check your phone.

14:51.569 --> 14:55.304
I'm gonna need some coffee.

15:11.423 --> 15:12.188
We have the actual count.

15:12.190 --> 15:13.222
Skip the Baccarat.

15:13.224 --> 15:16.092
If the head count is 190,
use the Waterford.

15:16.094 --> 15:18.227
190 people?

15:18.229 --> 15:20.863
Blake said this was gonna
be a small get-together.

15:20.865 --> 15:22.165
That is small.

15:23.914 --> 15:25.334
Well, at least we'll be outside.

15:25.336 --> 15:27.136
We'll be in the ballroom.

15:27.138 --> 15:28.771
Mr. Carrington prefers the ballroom.

15:31.109 --> 15:32.508
Can I talk to you?

15:39.017 --> 15:41.017
I know you've been
doing this a long time

15:41.019 --> 15:43.019
and I don't want to tell
you how to do your job.

15:43.021 --> 15:45.054
No, please. I am so curious.

15:45.056 --> 15:46.255
None of my friends

15:46.257 --> 15:49.325
care about stemware,
and they'll make fun of me

15:49.327 --> 15:51.561
if they know I live in a
house with an actual ballroom.

15:51.563 --> 15:55.331
Your friends amount to about
one percent of the guest list.

15:55.333 --> 15:57.967
This is for the 99%.

15:57.969 --> 15:59.702
That's ironic.

15:59.704 --> 16:02.738
Listen, can we at least do it outside?

16:02.740 --> 16:05.708
And I'll take Bowie on
Spotify over string quartet.

16:05.710 --> 16:07.577
And how about some wildflowers?

16:07.579 --> 16:10.413
I'll have the gardeners save
whatever weeds they dig up.

16:10.415 --> 16:13.249
That should be enough
to get you started.

16:18.056 --> 16:20.723
Your new boss seems great.

16:24.055 --> 16:26.209
_

16:30.675 --> 16:31.963
_

16:35.540 --> 16:38.274
How long have I been inside this house?

16:40.979 --> 16:43.513
You went out yesterday.

16:45.304 --> 16:47.203
You mean how long have we lived here?

16:47.238 --> 16:48.563
Mm-hmm.

16:49.719 --> 16:51.654
Almost 13 years, I think.

16:51.656 --> 16:53.389
That's unlucky.

17:01.366 --> 17:04.233
Good morning, Claudia.

17:04.234 --> 17:06.335
How we doing?

17:06.337 --> 17:08.804
Good, good, yeah, I mean...

17:08.806 --> 17:10.439
I know what the doctors are saying,

17:10.441 --> 17:12.308
but she's been, like,
really alert this week.

17:12.310 --> 17:13.643
Uh-huh. That's how it goes.

17:13.645 --> 17:15.578
Some days will be better than others.

17:15.579 --> 17:17.747
I got it from here.

17:35.333 --> 17:36.899
Beautiful.

17:36.901 --> 17:39.635
Now let's get a few of Cristal alone.

17:40.339 --> 17:42.171
Can I get a little
more fill on her face?

17:42.173 --> 17:43.806
Which one?

17:43.808 --> 17:45.942
How can you stand this
after what I told you?

17:45.944 --> 17:47.476
A temper gets you nowhere, Fallon.

17:47.478 --> 17:49.712
You need patience and a strategy.

17:49.714 --> 17:50.980
How is this a strategy?

17:50.982 --> 17:52.281
And turn.

17:56.821 --> 17:58.921
Matthew.

17:58.923 --> 18:00.890
Thank you for meeting me.

18:00.892 --> 18:03.826
It's a multitasking kind of day.

18:03.828 --> 18:06.495
You've met my fiancée, Cristal.

18:06.497 --> 18:07.930
Cristal is an associate in PR.

18:07.932 --> 18:10.700
Matthew is my best field engineer.

18:10.702 --> 18:11.767
I...

18:11.769 --> 18:12.902
I don't believe we have met.

18:12.904 --> 18:14.437
Haven't you?

18:14.439 --> 18:16.772
Recently, in fact?

18:18.142 --> 18:20.076
You were in a PR video

18:20.078 --> 18:21.944
- Cristal's team put together.
- Oh, right.

18:22.976 --> 18:24.344
- Thought you seemed familiar.
- That's right.

18:24.382 --> 18:26.482
Well, uh, congratulations.

18:27.100 --> 18:28.551
Excuse us a minute, will you, honey?

18:32.357 --> 18:34.490
This won't take long.

18:37.996 --> 18:40.730
You've heard about his wife,
haven't you?

18:40.732 --> 18:43.466
That man must be a saint.

18:48.479 --> 18:50.539
We'll send our lead engineer
to survey the plant in case...

18:50.541 --> 18:51.774
Forgive me.

18:51.776 --> 18:55.044
What exactly is your role
at Carrington Atlantic?

18:56.021 --> 18:57.813
I'm actually no longer with the company

18:57.815 --> 18:59.382
in an official capacity.

19:00.617 --> 19:01.317
You've heard of my father's efforts

19:01.319 --> 19:03.085
to bring fracking into Georgia?

19:03.344 --> 19:05.855
Yeah, the protests against it, yeah.

19:05.857 --> 19:07.156
Which I funded.

19:08.993 --> 19:10.726
All I wanted was a compromise.

19:10.728 --> 19:13.763
My father refused and then he lost

19:13.765 --> 19:15.531
a lot of money,

19:15.533 --> 19:17.133
his respect within the community,

19:17.135 --> 19:18.734
and... he'd say... his son.

19:19.639 --> 19:20.936
As far as my role,

19:20.938 --> 19:22.938
I guess I'm the black sheep

19:22.940 --> 19:24.540
looking to come home
to greener pastures.

19:26.255 --> 19:28.878
Usually I'd be wary of
selling to Carrington,

19:28.880 --> 19:31.747
but the idea that I could play a part

19:31.749 --> 19:35.117
in the company going green with you...

19:37.755 --> 19:39.255
Let's do it.

19:40.718 --> 19:42.725
My father will be in touch.

19:48.299 --> 19:50.666
Not your type?

19:52.437 --> 19:54.537
The ones my dad picks never are.

19:57.141 --> 19:59.108
And would your dad pick me?

20:05.216 --> 20:07.783
Never.

20:19.430 --> 20:21.263
I'm seeing Jeff Colby tonight.

20:22.700 --> 20:24.967
The tech guru. He used to work in I.T.

20:24.969 --> 20:26.502
Daddy hates him.

20:26.504 --> 20:27.737
Hate's a strong word.

20:27.739 --> 20:30.005
While Jeff was at C.A.,
he developed the music software

20:30.007 --> 20:32.241
that would go on to earn
him his first billion.

20:32.243 --> 20:34.677
Technically, we should have owned it,
but a judge disagreed.

20:34.679 --> 20:36.112
Okay, I guess I do hate him.

20:36.114 --> 20:37.847
Friend of hers' older brother.

20:37.849 --> 20:38.971
Bit of a charity case.

20:39.050 --> 20:40.283
Tried to give the kid a break.

20:40.352 --> 20:41.451
Just goes to show,

20:41.553 --> 20:43.252
you never know who's gonna
stab you in the back.

20:44.956 --> 20:46.222
Hey.

20:46.224 --> 20:48.090
You're missing all the fun, Steven.

20:48.092 --> 20:49.759
I had a date.

20:49.761 --> 20:51.994
A date? I didn't know.

20:51.996 --> 20:53.162
Neither did I.

20:53.164 --> 20:54.730
When you said we had "common interests"

20:54.732 --> 20:56.565
I didn't realize you were
whoring me out, Dad.

20:56.567 --> 20:58.968
- Can this wait till after dinner?
- It's fine.

20:58.970 --> 21:01.003
I'd be more pissed if he hadn't
agreed to let us tour Windbriar.

21:01.005 --> 21:02.271
What?

21:03.852 --> 21:05.875
- I gave you that tip.
- And you sent Steven?

21:05.877 --> 21:07.543
When striking any deal,

21:07.545 --> 21:09.845
you send in whoever makes the
client feel most comfortable.

21:09.847 --> 21:11.013
Is that so wrong?

21:11.015 --> 21:12.114
I bet he sent you

21:12.116 --> 21:14.450
to Prather with the
promise of going solar.

21:14.452 --> 21:15.584
But did he happen to mention

21:15.586 --> 21:17.086
that Windbriar's largest site

21:17.088 --> 21:19.755
is smack in the middle of a shale field?

21:19.757 --> 21:22.358
800 acres of frackable land.

21:22.360 --> 21:24.393
That's why I brought it to him.

21:25.492 --> 21:26.395
Is that true?

21:26.397 --> 21:28.097
There's a lot to work out.

21:28.099 --> 21:29.465
Actually, there's not.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.968
You used us both.

21:32.970 --> 21:34.203
And why?

21:34.205 --> 21:35.805
We could've worked together on this.

21:35.807 --> 21:37.373
Steven wouldn't have gone out there,
and you would've been

21:37.375 --> 21:38.741
jealous that I asked him.

21:38.743 --> 21:40.309
We would've fought either way.

21:40.311 --> 21:44.046
At least, now, we have a deal
on the table for Windbriar.

21:47.018 --> 21:50.586
In case you ever wondered
why my dad is so successful,

21:50.588 --> 21:53.355
it's because he's a genius
at making you feel like

21:53.357 --> 21:55.024
he's acting in your best interest,
when really

21:55.026 --> 21:56.559
it's all about him.

22:00.668 --> 22:01.734
Steven?

22:03.134 --> 22:04.800
I'm sorry you had to witness that.

22:04.802 --> 22:06.569
Fallon's right.

22:06.571 --> 22:08.471
About how you manipulate people.

22:09.373 --> 22:10.439
Matthew coming by today?

22:10.441 --> 22:11.807
Was that some sort of test?

22:11.809 --> 22:13.075
Oh, is that why you've been so quiet?

22:13.720 --> 22:15.347
Someone spotted you two last night.

22:15.382 --> 22:16.111
I didn't want to believe it.

22:16.113 --> 22:17.246
You could have asked me.

22:17.248 --> 22:18.747
Well, I wanted
to see you together myself.

22:18.749 --> 22:19.949
Because if I had just
told you it was over,

22:19.951 --> 22:21.183
that wouldn't have been enough?

22:21.185 --> 22:22.618
You didn't tell me.
You said you were going out

22:22.620 --> 22:24.386
- with your girlfriends.
- I did.

22:24.388 --> 22:26.155
- But then I went to...
- See him one last time?

22:26.157 --> 22:27.389
Yes.

22:27.391 --> 22:29.124
To tell him I loved you.

22:31.912 --> 22:32.695
"Loved"?

22:34.699 --> 22:37.700
Like Fallon said,
it's not worth getting upset about.

22:37.702 --> 22:39.068
It's only an engagement.

22:39.070 --> 22:41.303
- What is that supposed to mean?
- You'll figure it out.

22:41.305 --> 22:43.839
You're Blake effing Carrington.

22:56.987 --> 23:00.054
He saw that photo,
and he didn't dump her ass on the spot?

23:00.096 --> 23:01.862
We both know my father deals with things

23:01.864 --> 23:03.497
in his own screwed up way.

23:04.322 --> 23:06.167
The good news is,
too much damage has been done

23:06.169 --> 23:08.002
for it not to fall apart.

23:11.020 --> 23:15.176
And when it does,
I'll be ready to pick up the pieces.

23:17.246 --> 23:19.079
Wish me luck.

23:22.185 --> 23:24.084
Jeff Colby.

23:24.086 --> 23:24.872
Hey.

23:31.253 --> 23:33.327
All right, we have you
in our penthouse suite.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.362
Will you be needing one key or two?

23:36.199 --> 23:39.433
Two, please.

23:48.110 --> 23:49.410
<i>I got to say, I was, uh...</i>

23:49.412 --> 23:51.779
I was surprised you called.

23:51.781 --> 23:54.615
I always assumed you were
friends with my sister

23:54.617 --> 23:57.685
because you thought hanging
with the financial aid kids

23:57.687 --> 23:59.286
made you seem edgy.

23:59.288 --> 24:01.956
And you think a billion dollars later,
you've lost your edge?

24:02.910 --> 24:06.660
All I know is, no matter how
many zeros in my bank account,

24:06.662 --> 24:09.663
the hottest girl from high
school never loses her mystique.

24:09.665 --> 24:12.032
You have the second
highest bid on the Braves.

24:12.034 --> 24:13.801
Right now, Reuther Capital is outbidding

24:13.803 --> 24:15.569
both you and my father.

24:15.571 --> 24:17.238
So neither of you will win.

24:17.240 --> 24:18.572
Not alone.

24:18.574 --> 24:20.674
But if Colby Co. and Carrington Atlantic

24:20.676 --> 24:23.444
were to pool their resources,
say, my dad gets naming rights

24:23.446 --> 24:24.917
to the new stadium and
you get the team...

24:24.981 --> 24:28.616
You know, I should've known
you only wanted to talk work.

24:28.618 --> 24:31.285
You don't know any other way
to get off, do you?

24:31.287 --> 24:33.821
Oh, I know lots of ways.

24:34.857 --> 24:39.260
Then why isn't that
what we're negotiating?

24:45.034 --> 24:46.934
Think about it.

25:03.319 --> 25:06.020
Yeah, I know this is unexpected.

25:06.022 --> 25:07.521
You, outside of Buckhead?

25:07.523 --> 25:08.889
Extremely.

25:08.891 --> 25:10.524
I come in peace.

25:10.526 --> 25:11.717
And alone, I promise.

25:11.794 --> 25:14.361
No parade of flowers
or crates of champagne,

25:14.363 --> 25:17.731
just... just a simple apology.

25:17.733 --> 25:20.768
Anders isn't out front
with his string quartet?

25:20.770 --> 25:23.370
I'll make him wait in the van.

25:30.579 --> 25:33.948
You're working on Sunday?

25:33.950 --> 25:37.184
Well, you wanted those proposals
on your desk by tomorrow.

25:38.521 --> 25:39.787
We had a fight.

25:39.789 --> 25:41.210
I didn't think it meant I got fired.

25:41.257 --> 25:43.190
I'm sorry.

25:43.192 --> 25:44.792
I didn't confront you about Matthew

25:44.794 --> 25:46.627
because I was afraid of losing you.

25:46.629 --> 25:48.829
You have to trust me.

25:51.067 --> 25:54.001
You know, trust doesn't
come easy to Carringtons.

25:54.003 --> 25:56.503
But if I can learn,

25:56.505 --> 25:58.706
there's hope for Fallon, too.

25:59.375 --> 26:00.859
If I didn't tell you, she would.

26:00.943 --> 26:02.031
She was the one who saw you.

26:02.145 --> 26:04.244
She was just trying to protect me.

26:04.246 --> 26:05.772
By sabotaging us?

26:05.848 --> 26:07.815
All I want is for you
and Fallon to get along.

26:07.817 --> 26:09.350
How can we?

26:09.352 --> 26:12.720
She'll never see me as anything
but the girl you're banging.

26:12.722 --> 26:13.983
She doesn't respect me.

26:14.023 --> 26:15.756
Well, she will.

26:18.327 --> 26:22.696
I would like to make a
counterproposal to my proposal.

26:29.739 --> 26:31.805
I'm gonna hit the shower.

26:31.807 --> 26:32.873
Oh, no...

27:36.389 --> 27:41.542
You look so elegant,
I hardly recognized you.

27:41.544 --> 27:43.877
A moment with the bride, please?

27:43.879 --> 27:46.080
Hmm.

27:47.416 --> 27:49.183
It was Blake's idea.

27:49.185 --> 27:52.786
We were already having a party,
so he thought, why wait?

27:52.788 --> 27:55.856
But something tells
me you hate surprises.

27:55.858 --> 27:58.559
Oh, that's not what I hate.

28:07.069 --> 28:10.204
You should be having this
conversation with your father.

28:10.206 --> 28:13.407
After Matthew, I thought
we were done talking about you.

28:13.409 --> 28:15.375
Actually, thanks to your stalking,

28:15.377 --> 28:17.544
your dad and I are closer than ever.

28:17.546 --> 28:19.713
We've moved up
the wedding day, obviously,

28:19.715 --> 28:22.549
but we have another announcement, too.

28:22.551 --> 28:24.384
Now, don't tell me you're pregnant.

28:24.386 --> 28:27.855
What, you let him knock you up,
so you could lock him down?

28:27.857 --> 28:29.423
Fallon.

28:29.425 --> 28:32.826
That is no way to talk to your new boss.

28:32.828 --> 28:34.094
That's right.

28:34.096 --> 28:37.030
He offered me the C.O.O. position.

28:38.701 --> 28:40.467
That was supposed to be mine.

28:40.469 --> 28:44.037
Which is why I turned
it down the first time.

28:44.039 --> 28:45.405
Then I met you.

28:53.215 --> 28:55.182
Let go, bitch!

28:55.184 --> 28:56.550
Get off of me!

28:58.034 --> 29:00.587
There will be plenty of time
for this after the wedding.

29:00.589 --> 29:02.055
Bite me, Cristal.

29:02.057 --> 29:04.424
Please. Call me "Mom."

29:22.199 --> 29:24.311
- She isn't family.
- She will be soon.

29:24.346 --> 29:27.076
It's not the same thing.
Look at everyone we know:

29:27.111 --> 29:29.922
the Kochs, the Murdochs,
the president Dad voted for.

29:29.957 --> 29:31.582
All of those businesses were passed down

29:31.584 --> 29:32.817
to the next generation.

29:32.819 --> 29:35.419
Also worth noting:
all of those people are evil.

29:35.421 --> 29:38.389
Family dynasties flow through blood,
from parent to child.

29:38.391 --> 29:39.422
Wives?

29:40.226 --> 29:41.592
They just come and go.

29:41.594 --> 29:43.627
So that's what this is
really about, isn't it?

29:43.629 --> 29:44.995
Mom.

29:44.997 --> 29:46.630
Ever since the day she took off,

29:46.632 --> 29:48.899
you've done whatever you can
to fill the hole she left.

29:48.901 --> 29:51.135
You're always trying to be
the best and the brightest.

29:51.137 --> 29:52.970
I don't have to try, I just am.

29:52.972 --> 29:56.006
And now you feel like
you're being replaced.

29:56.008 --> 29:57.608
Not just at home, but worse:

29:57.610 --> 30:00.644
- at the office.
- So says your high-priced therapist.

30:02.081 --> 30:06.016
That company is the thing that
Dad values most in the world.

30:06.018 --> 30:07.821
He should be giving it to me.

30:07.856 --> 30:10.888
You know no one
can ever replace you, right?

30:10.890 --> 30:13.157
Not to me, not to Dad.

30:13.159 --> 30:15.359
He's in love.

30:16.596 --> 30:18.262
I can't compete with that.

30:19.059 --> 30:21.732
Then change the game.

30:21.734 --> 30:23.634
Or don't play at all.

30:33.346 --> 30:34.645
You're Carrington's field guy?

30:34.647 --> 30:36.046
Matthew Blaisdel. Thanks for having us.

30:36.048 --> 30:37.181
Sure.

30:37.183 --> 30:40.551
I've always been curious
about this place.

30:41.387 --> 30:43.354
Let me give you a tour of the facility.

30:43.356 --> 30:44.588
Come on.

30:54.471 --> 30:56.200
What's with the thumpers?

30:56.202 --> 30:57.535
I thought you guys were interested

30:57.537 --> 30:59.437
in what's above ground, not under it.

30:59.439 --> 31:00.671
If Carrington's gonna buy the land,

31:00.673 --> 31:01.839
he's gonna cover his bases.

31:01.841 --> 31:04.241
Tests will take a couple hours, tops.

31:04.243 --> 31:05.643
I'll even disclose everything I find,

31:05.645 --> 31:08.045
and you can use it to milk
Blake for all it's worth.

31:11.317 --> 31:15.019
I got to say, I'm surprised you
agreed to run point on this.

31:15.021 --> 31:16.787
Yeah, it's my last job.

31:16.789 --> 31:19.824
Gave Blake my notice yesterday.

31:19.826 --> 31:21.358
Life's too short.

31:21.360 --> 31:22.760
So it's got nothing to do with the fact

31:22.762 --> 31:25.362
that he's marrying your girlfriend?

31:25.364 --> 31:27.698
They're not married yet.

31:37.019 --> 31:38.709
Welcome.

31:43.830 --> 31:44.987
If I'd had any idea

31:45.032 --> 31:46.831
- what I'd invited you to...
- What do you mean?

31:46.833 --> 31:48.466
Everything looks beautiful.

31:48.468 --> 31:49.600
Very white, but...

31:49.602 --> 31:51.102
Ignore my sister.

31:51.778 --> 31:54.338
I've been thinking
about your Braves pitch.

31:54.340 --> 31:55.606
We should talk.

31:55.608 --> 31:56.741
Let's.

31:56.743 --> 31:58.276
Meet me in the pool house in an hour?

31:58.278 --> 32:00.044
Hello!

32:00.046 --> 32:01.846
Thank you all for coming.

32:01.848 --> 32:03.114
Everyone's been asking

32:03.116 --> 32:05.349
when Cristal and I are getting married.

32:06.619 --> 32:08.152
We are thrilled to announce

32:08.154 --> 32:11.222
that we have picked a date and a venue.

32:12.092 --> 32:13.124
It's today.

32:13.126 --> 32:14.092
Right here.

32:14.235 --> 32:16.060
And you all are invited.

32:21.334 --> 32:23.901
Wait a minute,
this is a surprise wedding?

32:23.903 --> 32:25.736
More like an ambush.

32:32.278 --> 32:34.712
Take a peek outside.

32:48.361 --> 32:51.796
I can't believe Anders came around.

32:51.798 --> 32:54.398
Pretty sure he didn't.

32:57.537 --> 32:59.470
This was all my dad.

33:38.678 --> 33:41.145
Well, after last night,
I wasn't sure you'd stick around.

33:42.916 --> 33:44.615
Guess you're here for Cristal.

33:44.617 --> 33:46.651
I'm here for you.

33:49.522 --> 33:51.589
Thought there might be
an opening for best man.

34:17.217 --> 34:19.083
Mrs. Carrington.

34:19.085 --> 34:20.784
Thank you.

34:22.487 --> 34:24.222
Look how happy you've made him.

34:25.891 --> 34:28.092
That's the happiest
I've seen him since...

34:28.094 --> 34:29.627
The first Mrs. Carrington?

34:30.157 --> 34:32.168
You know, I don't know
anything about Alexis.

34:32.203 --> 34:33.697
Your father never talks about her.

34:39.572 --> 34:41.739
You two know each other?

34:41.741 --> 34:43.174
Do you?

34:43.176 --> 34:44.442
No.

34:44.444 --> 34:46.476
Not really, we...

34:46.478 --> 34:48.913
crossed paths at the bar
near your place yesterday.

34:48.915 --> 34:50.514
How funny.

34:50.516 --> 34:52.516
Well, Steven, this is my nephew

34:52.518 --> 34:55.953
- Sammy Jo.
- Nobody calls me that anymore.

34:55.955 --> 34:57.154
Sam.

34:58.858 --> 35:00.424
Nephew?

35:00.426 --> 35:02.727
My big sister's son.

35:02.729 --> 35:03.761
Can we talk?

35:03.763 --> 35:05.730
Yeah.

35:07.133 --> 35:10.001
What are you doing here?

35:10.003 --> 35:12.637
Uh, you mean why didn't you invite me?

35:12.639 --> 35:14.705
It's like you think I'm
trouble or something.

35:14.707 --> 35:16.207
So you're telling me that
paths are the only thing

35:16.209 --> 35:17.174
you and Steven crossed?

35:17.176 --> 35:19.877
I love you, but I also know you.

35:19.879 --> 35:21.078
And what do these people know?

35:22.915 --> 35:24.382
Please, Sam.

35:24.384 --> 35:26.350
Things are already complicated here.

35:26.352 --> 35:29.186
Sounds like my kind of place.

35:32.544 --> 35:35.693
If your father wants his
brand on the stadium, fine,

35:35.695 --> 35:37.561
but then he has to walk away.

35:37.563 --> 35:39.497
Forget baseball for a second.

35:40.274 --> 35:42.933
I've spent years studying my father.

35:42.935 --> 35:45.670
Preparing to be his second in command.

35:45.672 --> 35:47.071
But then I look at someone like you.

35:47.735 --> 35:49.774
You've never had a shadow cast over you.

35:49.776 --> 35:51.242
Everybody knows you by your name,

35:51.244 --> 35:53.044
not your father's.

35:54.681 --> 35:55.967
That's what I want.

35:56.049 --> 35:58.182
You want your name on the stadium?

35:58.184 --> 36:00.318
I said forget baseball.

36:00.320 --> 36:03.054
I have another investment
opportunity for you.

36:03.056 --> 36:05.323
And what would that be?

36:07.060 --> 36:08.592
Me.

36:13.966 --> 36:15.633
Blaisdel,

36:15.635 --> 36:17.501
hydraulics are down.

36:18.757 --> 36:20.771
Man, I've never seen that before.

36:20.773 --> 36:22.840
I got it.

36:32.623 --> 36:34.485
All right, here.

36:34.487 --> 36:35.565
Do it again.

36:50.770 --> 36:52.103
Look out!

36:58.111 --> 37:00.211
So, did you get everything
you ever dreamed of?

37:03.516 --> 37:05.015
Now I did.

37:05.017 --> 37:06.851
The kissing bells.

37:08.154 --> 37:10.788
Is it some family tradition?

37:10.790 --> 37:12.490
It's a superstition.

37:12.492 --> 37:14.892
The ringing is supposed
to scare away the Devil.

37:22.703 --> 37:24.435
Call an ambulance!

37:24.437 --> 37:26.971
No, no, no, call Cristal.

37:26.973 --> 37:28.038
Call Cristal.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.207
Call his wife!

37:30.209 --> 37:31.642
Call Claudia.

37:36.741 --> 37:39.483
And then, once the Devil is gone...

37:39.485 --> 37:41.585
We live happily ever after.

37:45.328 --> 37:48.861
Ready? Three, two, one!

38:00.425 --> 38:02.225
Jeff.

38:02.227 --> 38:03.660
I didn't know you were here.

38:04.390 --> 38:05.595
Thanks for including me.

38:05.597 --> 38:06.796
I didn't.

38:08.533 --> 38:09.699
Oh, hey.

38:09.701 --> 38:10.967
Moved on that tip.

38:10.969 --> 38:12.101
Just got off the phone with him.

38:12.103 --> 38:13.603
What tip is this?

38:13.605 --> 38:15.438
Company called Windbriar.

38:15.440 --> 38:16.406
Heard of it?

38:16.408 --> 38:17.740
What the hell have you done?

38:17.742 --> 38:19.642
You can't just dabble in energy.

38:19.644 --> 38:20.743
You don't have the experience.

38:20.745 --> 38:22.579
But I do. With Jeff's backing

38:22.581 --> 38:24.547
I will be chief executive officer

38:24.549 --> 38:26.349
of Carrington Windbriar.

38:26.351 --> 38:28.551
My own company, my name...

38:28.553 --> 38:29.686
Actually, it's my name.

38:29.688 --> 38:32.922
And your new competition.

38:51.843 --> 38:53.676
Hello?

38:53.678 --> 38:55.645
So, what kind of a butler are you?

38:55.647 --> 38:58.781
More of a Bates or a Belvedere?

38:58.783 --> 39:01.684
Your aunt failed to mention
how long you'd be staying.

39:02.454 --> 39:04.454
I'm still working on that.

39:06.958 --> 39:07.991
Hey.

39:08.921 --> 39:11.527
Steven.

39:11.529 --> 39:16.332
Just wanted to thank you for
not saying anything earlier.

39:16.334 --> 39:17.300
About the money.

39:17.849 --> 39:18.835
What?

39:19.671 --> 39:22.472
About the money I took at the hotel?

39:24.338 --> 39:26.242
You... You didn't even notice?

39:26.244 --> 39:28.111
Nope.

39:29.381 --> 39:31.180
Why'd you lie?

39:33.051 --> 39:34.150
I'm in a tight spot.

39:34.152 --> 39:36.352
No, I mean to Cristal.

39:37.394 --> 39:38.388
About us?

39:39.679 --> 39:42.025
Are you the black sheep
of your family, too?

39:44.095 --> 39:45.895
No.

39:45.897 --> 39:46.996
She is.

39:49.776 --> 39:52.302
You're in a better mood
than I'd thought you'd be.

39:52.304 --> 39:53.536
You work things out with your dad?

39:53.538 --> 39:55.705
Something like that.

39:55.707 --> 39:57.440
Fallon. Hey.

39:58.553 --> 40:02.111
Thought we could, uh,
run over your game plan before I go.

40:02.113 --> 40:04.380
- You got time?
- Uh, sure.

40:04.382 --> 40:05.848
Can I get another bourbon
on the rocks, please?

40:05.850 --> 40:07.817
Oh, he-he's not a waiter.

40:07.819 --> 40:12.021
Oh, uh... man, I'm sorry.

40:12.023 --> 40:14.157
Um...

40:14.159 --> 40:15.525
this is Michael Culhane.

40:15.527 --> 40:17.260
- He's...
- The chauffeur.

40:18.096 --> 40:20.263
Oh.

40:20.265 --> 40:21.964
Uh, well, perfect.

40:21.966 --> 40:24.434
If you can bail early,
let's go out for a drink.

40:24.436 --> 40:26.102
You can give us a ride.

40:26.104 --> 40:27.804
Yeah.

40:38.616 --> 40:39.916
Oh, Anders.

40:39.918 --> 40:40.917
You don't have to do that.

40:40.919 --> 40:43.052
I wear many hats around here:

40:43.054 --> 40:44.387
valet, party planner.

40:44.389 --> 40:46.155
Although you may have
relieved me of that.

40:46.157 --> 40:47.156
I assure you,

40:47.158 --> 40:48.858
I am not out for your job.

40:48.860 --> 40:51.060
That must make me the exception.

40:51.062 --> 40:52.795
Excuse me?

40:52.797 --> 40:56.666
Should your ambitions change,
just know that,

40:56.668 --> 40:58.668
among my myriad responsibilities

40:58.670 --> 41:01.204
is managing the hiring of staff.

41:01.206 --> 41:03.339
And that includes running
background checks.

41:03.341 --> 41:05.174
When I heard about your tryst,

41:05.176 --> 41:06.709
I decided to run yours.

41:06.711 --> 41:10.413
I use a very thorough,
very private service.

41:10.415 --> 41:12.448
And what they uncovered was riveting.

41:13.287 --> 41:15.284
Samuel Josiah Jones.

41:15.286 --> 41:17.153
Sammy Jo?

41:17.155 --> 41:19.722
I've just moved him into the guest wing.

41:19.724 --> 41:21.524
Whatever you found, I can explain.

41:21.526 --> 41:22.759
Oh, there's no need.

41:22.761 --> 41:23.926
Really. As I say,

41:23.928 --> 41:25.728
they're very thorough.

41:25.730 --> 41:27.697
I know everything.

41:29.323 --> 41:31.033
Sweetheart.

41:31.870 --> 41:33.136
You ready?

41:33.138 --> 41:34.470
Mm-hmm.

41:57.942 --> 42:00.897
He tried to quit,
and you sent him to that place!

42:00.899 --> 42:02.899
It was no accident!

42:04.135 --> 42:06.235
You killed my husband!
