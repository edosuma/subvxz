00:13.700 --> 00:17.749
Captain's log, star date 41365.9.

00:17.875 --> 00:20.962
The Enterprise has been ordered
to Star base 74,

00:21.090 --> 00:23.131
in orbit around Tarsas III.

00:23.260 --> 00:28.260
A routine maintenance check will
be made and certain upgrades done,

00:28.396 --> 00:31.185
including the holodeck,
which has had problems.

00:31.318 --> 00:33.277
I anticipate a glowing report.

00:33.405 --> 00:36.778
The ship performs magnificently,
beyond expectations.

00:47.099 --> 00:49.343
Coming into position.

00:49.479 --> 00:51.140
Stand by to dock.

00:51.650 --> 00:52.979
Ready to dock, sir.

01:00.626 --> 01:02.501
Engage mooring beams.

01:03.172 --> 01:05.001
- And lock off.
- Aye, sir.

01:10.687 --> 01:13.442
And... docking complete.

01:14.862 --> 01:17.237
Thank you, Number One.

01:17.367 --> 01:19.326
Well done.

01:19.454 --> 01:20.867
And...

01:22.168 --> 01:23.545
..well done, all.

01:35.319 --> 01:38.525
Star base maintenance
approaching airlock five.

01:56.402 --> 01:58.896
Cmdr Quinteros. Permission to board?

01:59.032 --> 02:00.908
Granted. Welcome.

02:02.331 --> 02:03.327
Captain.

02:03.458 --> 02:05.119
Cmdr Riker.

02:08.092 --> 02:10.764
You're late.
We expected you a week ago.

02:10.889 --> 02:16.518
- We were delayed at Omicron Pascal.
- Any specific you wish to report?

02:16.650 --> 02:19.405
No, we're very pleased
with the Enterprise.

02:19.531 --> 02:23.283
I knew you would be.
I headed the team that built her.

02:23.414 --> 02:28.294
- Are these gentlemen the Bynars?
- They're not gentlemen. Or ladies.

02:28.424 --> 02:31.630
They're a unified pair.
They're always together.

02:31.763 --> 02:35.931
This is One Zero.
And this is Zero One.

02:36.064 --> 02:39.899
They upgraded the computers
on the Wellington. A great job.

02:40.030 --> 02:43.069
Your reputation precedes you.
I'm pleased to have you.

02:43.203 --> 02:46.076
A pleasure
to work on such a computer.

02:46.209 --> 02:51.374
You have 48 hours. In 48 plus six
we must leave for Pelleus V.

02:51.511 --> 02:53.552
I thought we had more time.

02:53.682 --> 02:56.935
Sorry. We can't delay.
You could postpone the work.

02:57.063 --> 03:01.112
No. We can complete
our work within the time allotted.

03:01.238 --> 03:03.946
They work very quickly,
but it'll be tight.

03:04.870 --> 03:07.660
Cmdr Riker and I will stay on board.

03:07.793 --> 03:11.212
We won't need you
until we're ready for inspection.

03:19.274 --> 03:24.237
The Bynars seem perfect for this.
It's the first time I've met them.

03:24.367 --> 03:29.579
They have become so interconnected
with their planet's master computer

03:29.711 --> 03:32.287
that their language
and thought patterns

03:32.425 --> 03:35.927
are as close to binary
as it's possible for organic beings.

03:36.057 --> 03:39.892
I wonder how they'll improve
a computer as advanced as ours.

03:43.321 --> 03:48.451
Bridge. Well, I have work to finish,
then I'm going to put my feet up,

03:48.581 --> 03:54.423
turn on my relaxation light and lose
myself in the pages of an old novel.

03:54.551 --> 03:56.795
And you? You've earned a rest.

03:56.931 --> 03:59.639
I'm not good at organizing
my time off.

03:59.770 --> 04:02.310
Something will turn up.
It always does.

04:13.422 --> 04:15.463
I'll be in my ready room.

04:15.593 --> 04:18.930
And, Number One,... good work.

04:27.617 --> 04:30.075
I thought there'd only be two of you.

04:31.708 --> 04:34.498
Because of the limited time,
we need others.

04:34.630 --> 04:37.385
- Is there a problem?
- No! No problem.

04:37.762 --> 04:39.590
Then why are you so excited?

04:39.724 --> 04:43.476
Because we must... Stacking!
To reconfigure the computer.

04:43.606 --> 04:47.608
To communicate with itself
more efficiently and faster.

04:49.660 --> 04:52.034
You act like
you don't believe them.

04:52.165 --> 04:55.252
I'm not sure that I do.
Maybe it's nothing.

04:55.380 --> 04:57.873
Perhaps it's how
their species behaves.

04:58.010 --> 05:01.014
Maybe. I'm going to stroll
around the ship.

05:01.141 --> 05:03.717
You got the bridge.
Keep your eye on them.

05:03.855 --> 05:05.481
Yes, sir.

05:37.379 --> 05:40.502
Space, the final frontier.

05:42.180 --> 05:46.134
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

05:46.271 --> 05:50.403
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,...

05:52.200 --> 05:55.904
..to seek out new life
and new civilizations,...

05:56.792 --> 06:00.496
..to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

07:08.308 --> 07:12.891
We've been challenged to a game of
parrises squares by Maintenance.

07:13.026 --> 07:16.528
- Want to join us on the star base?
- You have a full team.

07:16.658 --> 07:20.825
- We can switch off.
- You'll lose the rhythm of the game.

07:20.958 --> 07:25.006
- I can't persuade you?
- No, but win. For the Enterprise.

07:25.133 --> 07:28.552
Rest assured, we will be victorious.
Whatever the cost.

07:28.681 --> 07:30.925
Worf, it's just a friendly game.

07:31.061 --> 07:34.564
Work up a sweat,
have a few laughs, make new friends.

07:34.693 --> 07:39.276
If winning is not important,
then, Commander, why keep score?

07:44.128 --> 07:46.170
I think he's pulling your leg.

07:47.260 --> 07:50.964
Believe it or not, Worf
is developing a sense of humour.

07:51.100 --> 07:54.104
I hope so, for their sake.
Good luck.

08:06.047 --> 08:10.095
Computer, there's a power reduction
in section L-94. Explain.

08:10.221 --> 08:12.797
Unoccupied sections
are being closed down

08:12.935 --> 08:15.511
to clear space
in the main computer banks.

08:15.649 --> 08:18.736
It is necessary
to facilitate the system upgrade.

08:18.863 --> 08:21.653
Full power can be restored if needed.

08:26.170 --> 08:31.465
- Well, what do you think?
- Tell me what it's supposed to be.

08:31.597 --> 08:34.386
It is an attempt at pure creativity.

08:34.519 --> 08:37.440
We're investigating
if Data can be creative.

08:37.567 --> 08:40.654
And this... is my attempt,

08:41.323 --> 08:43.366
with guidance from Geordi.

08:43.495 --> 08:47.164
- I suggested the zylo eggs.
- Is that what those are?

08:48.714 --> 08:53.095
Keep notes. This project may be
of interest to future scholars.

08:53.223 --> 08:54.220
Really?

08:54.350 --> 08:56.974
A blind man teaching an android
to paint.

08:58.483 --> 09:02.187
That's gotta be worth
a couple of pages in somebody's book.

09:14.515 --> 09:16.759
Are you packing to leave for ever?

09:16.894 --> 09:21.359
Cmdr Riker.
No, I'm just gathering my notes.

09:24.326 --> 09:27.614
Professor Terence Epstein
is at the star base.

09:28.709 --> 09:31.167
Is that someone I should know of?

09:34.972 --> 09:37.845
He's the leading mind in cybernetics.

09:39.982 --> 09:42.226
He lectured at my medical school.

09:43.530 --> 09:46.202
You know the disaster at Micromius?

09:46.327 --> 09:49.035
Since then
I've been working on an approach

09:49.166 --> 09:52.455
that combines cybernetics
and regeneration.

09:52.590 --> 09:56.841
Sounds impossible, I know, but I've
found an approach that will work.

09:56.973 --> 10:01.640
What an opportunity! To have
a chance to talk with Dr. Epstein.

10:05.240 --> 10:08.243
Sorry, Will, I'd love to chat
but I have to go.

10:21.104 --> 10:22.101
How's it going?

10:22.231 --> 10:26.185
Almost done. The deviation
caused by a probe is corrected.

10:26.323 --> 10:28.234
You may use it any time you wish.

10:28.368 --> 10:31.491
How much has changed?
What exactly did you do?

10:31.625 --> 10:33.785
- Enhancement.
- Nothing more.

10:38.847 --> 10:44.808
- Do you wish to try the enhancement?
- Alright. What should I choose?

10:47.406 --> 10:51.110
Computer, I'd like someplace
to play music. With atmosphere.

10:51.247 --> 10:53.325
- Specify.
- Jazz.

10:53.459 --> 10:56.463
- Era?
- Circa 1958.

10:56.591 --> 10:58.835
- Location?
- Kansas City.

10:59.931 --> 11:04.562
No. New Orleans.
Bourbon Street bar in New Orleans.

11:04.690 --> 11:06.483
Around 2 am.

11:06.610 --> 11:09.282
Program complete. Enter when ready.

11:16.213 --> 11:17.839
Very good.

11:20.596 --> 11:22.425
Very good indeed.

11:28.028 --> 11:31.281
Now, I'll need someone to play with.
A trio.

11:31.409 --> 11:34.199
Piano, bass, drums.
And a 'bone for me.

11:40.302 --> 11:41.928
Now, an audience.

11:46.606 --> 11:47.770
Too many.

11:52.325 --> 11:56.279
I was thinking of something...
a little more intimate.

11:59.214 --> 12:00.674
Great job, boys.

12:01.802 --> 12:07.182
But, computer,
blondes and jazz seldom go together.

12:13.200 --> 12:16.157
Now, that is truly exceptional.

12:19.671 --> 12:21.001
But more sultry.

12:39.502 --> 12:43.669
Gentlemen, if this is
what you call enhancement,...

12:45.096 --> 12:47.636
..you have a gift for understatement.

13:09.853 --> 13:13.391
What's your name?
Tell me you love jazz.

13:13.527 --> 13:19.286
My name is Minuet,
and I love all jazz except Dixieland.

13:19.998 --> 13:23.786
- Why not Dixieland?
- You can't dance to it.

13:25.217 --> 13:26.843
My girl!

13:37.449 --> 13:39.111
What's a knockout like you

13:39.244 --> 13:42.367
doing in a computer-generated
gin joint like this?

13:43.169 --> 13:44.581
Waiting for you.

13:45.173 --> 13:48.759
Waiting for me? You can't be serious.

13:48.888 --> 13:50.467
Yes, Will.

13:51.769 --> 13:55.106
I've never been more serious
in my life.

14:33.100 --> 14:35.772
Can I ask you a question
about the Bynars?

14:38.319 --> 14:40.147
Why not just ask them?

14:43.955 --> 14:46.662
What is that high-pitched sound
you make?

14:46.794 --> 14:51.211
- It's our primary language.
- How do you process data so fast?

14:51.344 --> 14:53.423
We store information with these.

14:53.557 --> 14:56.727
We receive it all the time
and save it until needed.

14:57.356 --> 14:59.434
How did you develop this ability?

14:59.569 --> 15:02.276
It happened
over a long period of time.

15:02.408 --> 15:06.077
A society intermixed with computers
has great advantages.

15:06.207 --> 15:07.917
And a few disadvantages.

15:12.344 --> 15:14.173
Everything under control?

15:14.306 --> 15:17.726
Fine, sir. I was trying
to find out about the Bynars.

15:18.773 --> 15:22.526
- Where's Cmdr Riker?
- On holodeck four. Shall I call him?

15:23.282 --> 15:27.331
No, I'll go down there myself.
Keep me apprised.

15:27.457 --> 15:28.869
Yes, sir.

16:50.746 --> 16:53.322
Man, the chick digs you.

16:54.337 --> 16:57.839
- What makes you say that?
- Look at her.

17:01.935 --> 17:06.067
- Maybe it's my music.
- Well, don't give up your day job.

17:11.036 --> 17:12.531
Too real!

17:12.664 --> 17:16.166
You got that straight, Slim.
Too real is too right.

17:16.756 --> 17:20.258
- Thanks for letting me sit in.
- Ain't nothing to it.

17:26.983 --> 17:29.858
I have to leave for a while
to see to my duties.

17:30.950 --> 17:33.075
Your work's very important to you.

17:33.205 --> 17:35.164
It is me. It's what I am.

17:36.044 --> 17:38.418
Can we dance once before you leave?

17:40.887 --> 17:42.798
Sure. Why not?

17:51.407 --> 17:55.111
- How did you learn to dance so well?
- From following you.

17:55.248 --> 17:57.706
I can anticipate your lead.

17:58.922 --> 18:01.380
So, tell me about your work.

18:01.845 --> 18:05.763
What is it about it
that consumes and enthrals you?

18:06.646 --> 18:11.027
Interesting choice of words.
That's exactly what it does.

18:11.739 --> 18:14.743
- You're very fortunate.
- I know that.

18:15.705 --> 18:18.281
To be exactly where you want to be.

18:19.170 --> 18:21.628
And it's great that you realize it.

18:23.763 --> 18:27.051
I'd be a fool not to realize
how lucky I am...

18:28.355 --> 18:31.561
..to be on this ship,
serving with these people.

18:31.695 --> 18:33.736
It's like a dream come true.

18:34.826 --> 18:36.452
Just like this.

18:36.580 --> 18:39.786
A dream? Is that what this is?

18:40.880 --> 18:42.708
Is that what I am?

18:43.593 --> 18:47.298
I know you're
a computer-generated image, but...

18:49.438 --> 18:51.064
..your smell,...

18:52.152 --> 18:54.396
..your touch, the way you feel.

18:55.367 --> 18:58.786
Even the things you say and think
seem so real.

19:00.084 --> 19:01.710
Thank you.

19:04.259 --> 19:06.503
How far can this relationship go?

19:09.478 --> 19:11.306
I mean, how real are you?

19:12.317 --> 19:14.644
As real as you need me to be.

19:42.459 --> 19:45.131
- Astounding.
- Captain.

19:45.256 --> 19:49.175
- Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
- It's alright. Come on in.

19:50.392 --> 19:52.636
You picked a wonderful locale.

19:52.771 --> 19:56.190
This is something
I might have chosen myself.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.940
Aren't you going to introduce me?

20:00.077 --> 20:04.874
Capt Picard, this is Minuet.
Minuet, Capt Jean-Luc Picard.

20:05.004 --> 20:08.173
Enchantée. Comme c'est merveilleux
de vous voir ici.

20:08.845 --> 20:11.516
Incroyable. Vous étes Parisienne?

20:11.642 --> 20:14.218
Au fond, nous sommes tous Parisiens.

20:14.355 --> 20:17.276
Oui, au fond,
nous sommes tous Parisiens.

20:18.029 --> 20:22.411
The spirit of that city
can always enchant my soul.

20:22.538 --> 20:25.210
I have been hoping to meet you.

20:25.335 --> 20:27.377
Was I the subject of conversation?

20:29.009 --> 20:33.058
Indirectly. Come, join us, Jean-Luc.

20:39.697 --> 20:42.107
- A glass of wine?
- Thank you.

20:44.415 --> 20:47.751
Will was saying how much he enjoys
this assignment.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.625
It's a credit to you.

20:49.758 --> 20:53.807
For a ship and crew to function well,
it starts with the captain.

20:54.977 --> 20:56.639
You set the tone.

20:56.772 --> 20:59.979
At this moment,
it is you who are setting the tone.

21:02.492 --> 21:06.244
The sophistication of
this programming is remarkable.

21:07.001 --> 21:08.413
In what way?

21:08.545 --> 21:13.010
The holodeck has given us woodlands
and ski slopes, figures that fight

21:13.138 --> 21:18.600
and fictional characters with whom we
can interact. You're very different.

21:18.732 --> 21:20.893
You adapt. You spoke in French.

21:21.028 --> 21:23.783
It was very simple.
When I heard your name,

21:23.909 --> 21:26.866
I merely accessed
the foreign-language bank.

21:29.587 --> 21:33.256
- That's very impressive.
- Oui, mon chou.

21:41.652 --> 21:43.481
Now what are you doing?

21:44.575 --> 21:46.735
I'm awaiting inspiration.

21:46.871 --> 21:49.625
- Cmdr Data?
- This is Cmdr Data. Go ahead.

21:49.752 --> 21:52.589
We have possible trouble
in Engineering, sir.

21:52.716 --> 21:54.176
Can you be specific?

21:54.302 --> 21:57.674
I'm afraid not. It's in
the magnetic containment field

21:57.809 --> 22:00.647
containing the antimatter.
Can you come up?

22:00.773 --> 22:03.943
We'll go to Engineering
as that's where the trouble is.

22:04.071 --> 22:06.612
Don't disturb the Captain
or Cmdr Riker yet.

22:06.743 --> 22:08.120
Aye, sir.

22:20.061 --> 22:23.564
- Bridge, this is Main Engineering.
- This is the bridge.

22:23.693 --> 22:26.816
- Are you running test programs?
- No.

22:26.950 --> 22:28.991
Are the Bynars?

22:29.121 --> 22:31.614
Not to my knowledge.
Is there a problem?

22:32.586 --> 22:35.258
I don't know.
There's no one on duty here.

22:35.383 --> 22:39.005
We have strange readings
from the magnetic containment field.

22:39.140 --> 22:43.225
It's deteriorating. Contact the
Captain. I'm initiating red alert.

22:44.693 --> 22:47.566
I can't maintain
the containment field.

22:47.699 --> 22:49.444
Engineering to Captain.

22:51.916 --> 22:55.003
If the antimatter is released,
we'll be destroyed.

22:55.130 --> 22:58.004
Nothing I do has any effect.
I'm losing it.

22:58.679 --> 23:02.930
I've rechecked every circuit.
This is not a computer misreading.

23:03.063 --> 23:05.223
Computer, situation analysis.

23:05.359 --> 23:09.906
Estimate release of antimatter
in four minutes, 18 seconds.

23:10.035 --> 23:13.656
17 seconds... 16 seconds...

23:13.792 --> 23:16.166
- Engineering to bridge.
- Bridge here.

23:16.297 --> 23:19.467
Alert Star base. Inform them
we are abandoning ship.

23:19.595 --> 23:22.765
Explain why. Initiate
automated departure sequence.

23:22.893 --> 23:27.726
Set course and speed to keep maximum
distance from any inhabited planets.

23:28.529 --> 23:31.617
- Shouldn't we wait for the Captain?
- We've no time.

23:31.744 --> 23:35.912
Based on all present information,
the decision is correct.

23:36.044 --> 23:38.752
This is Lt. Cmdr Data
speaking for the Captain.

23:38.883 --> 23:42.255
Abandon ship. This is not a drill.

23:42.390 --> 23:45.809
All personnel, this is not a drill.

23:46.481 --> 23:49.236
I say again, abandon ship.

23:49.362 --> 23:53.031
All personnel, this is not a drill.

23:53.161 --> 23:55.239
Abandon ship.

24:02.179 --> 24:05.634
Decks two through four
to cargo transporters.

24:06.730 --> 24:08.558
Decks five through ten,

24:08.692 --> 24:12.740
proceed to transporters
one, two, three and four.

24:13.618 --> 24:16.028
Decks six through 16,

24:16.165 --> 24:20.249
proceed to transporters
five, six, seven, eight, nine...

24:20.381 --> 24:24.430
Hold your positions, please.
Prepare to energize.

24:25.308 --> 24:27.349
And energize.

24:31.612 --> 24:33.939
Decks 29 through 42,

24:34.075 --> 24:36.829
proceed to transporters 15, 16,

24:36.956 --> 24:40.708
17, 18, 19 and 20.

24:41.381 --> 24:42.793
This is not a drill.

24:51.568 --> 24:54.655
- What's going on?
- Please, stand out of the way.

24:54.782 --> 24:57.026
- The ship is being evacuated.
- Why?

24:57.162 --> 25:01.116
- Some problem in Engineering.
- Get a Security team together.

25:05.554 --> 25:09.686
Ship's log, supplemental.
This is Lt. Cmdr Data.

25:09.812 --> 25:12.602
I have put the ship
on automated departure

25:12.734 --> 25:15.524
and ordered evacuation
of the Enterprise.

25:15.657 --> 25:19.409
Everyone remaining is leaving
on foot or beaming off.

25:19.540 --> 25:22.413
Computer, where are the Captain
and Cmdr Riker?

25:22.545 --> 25:24.505
All decks empty.

25:24.633 --> 25:27.423
Curious.
The Captain is usually last to leave.

25:27.555 --> 25:29.930
Let's go.
We've only got 41 seconds.

25:34.360 --> 25:36.189
I think we're the last.

25:36.323 --> 25:37.949
I hope we are.

25:52.145 --> 25:56.361
- Did you see the Captain and Riker?
- No. Are they not on Star base?

25:56.487 --> 25:59.028
- No.
- They're still on the Enterprise?

25:59.159 --> 26:01.534
Yes.
Sir, where is your transporter room?

26:01.664 --> 26:04.584
- We must beam back for them.
- You haven't time.

26:04.712 --> 26:08.630
Star base 74. The Enterprise
magnetic field is regenerating.

26:09.304 --> 26:12.926
- Wait. How is that possible?
- That changes nothing!

26:13.062 --> 26:16.481
The Captain and Cmdr Riker
are in trouble or they'd be here.

26:16.610 --> 26:19.068
Look! Your ship is almost clear.

27:15.267 --> 27:17.345
And the boy never found out?

27:17.480 --> 27:21.232
Yes, but not until he came back in
with his little sister.

27:21.363 --> 27:23.404
I bet they were all smiles.

27:23.534 --> 27:25.742
Yes, but they'd been found out.

27:25.872 --> 27:28.579
You handled that
in a very thoughtful way.

27:28.711 --> 27:31.999
You're good with people.
Don't you agree, Jean-Luc?

27:32.134 --> 27:36.847
She's very different from the other
images we've met on the holodeck.

27:37.937 --> 27:39.397
She's more intuitive.

27:39.523 --> 27:43.311
It's as though she's been
plugged into my subconscious.

27:43.448 --> 27:47.449
She knows what I want her to say
before I'm aware of it myself.

27:47.581 --> 27:49.790
An understandable progression.

27:49.919 --> 27:52.709
Computers make decisions
based on input.

27:52.841 --> 27:56.677
We humans give off
a multitude of subtle signs that...

27:57.559 --> 27:59.803
..that communicate our emotions.

27:59.939 --> 28:01.482
It's uncanny.

28:03.613 --> 28:08.030
I could develop feelings for Minuet
exactly as I would for any woman.

28:08.163 --> 28:12.877
Doesn't love always begin with the
illusion more real than the woman?

28:13.632 --> 28:16.720
Jean-Luc,
spoken like a true Frenchman.

28:18.642 --> 28:21.848
- Well, I think I'll be leaving.
- Don't go!

28:21.982 --> 28:25.686
- Two's company.
- We have time. There's no rush.

28:26.157 --> 28:30.455
- I'd really like it if you'd stay.
- Yes, Captain, stay.

28:31.250 --> 28:35.548
- This is your diversion, not mine.
- Wait! We haven't danced.

28:35.676 --> 28:37.717
- I don't dance.
- Then more wine.

28:37.847 --> 28:39.307
- No, thank you.
- Wait.

28:39.433 --> 28:42.556
Please don't go. You can't. Not yet.

28:42.689 --> 28:44.815
What's wrong? Why can't he leave?

28:44.944 --> 28:46.570
Exit!

28:56.216 --> 28:58.674
Captain to bridge. Situation report.

28:59.765 --> 29:01.391
Riker to bridge.

29:03.313 --> 29:07.149
- Computer, explain red alert.
- A programmed response.

29:07.280 --> 29:11.328
The magnetic field containing
the antimatter had weakened.

29:11.454 --> 29:13.698
- Why wasn't I notified?
- Unknown.

29:13.834 --> 29:16.754
- Present condition?
- Magnetic field restored.

29:16.882 --> 29:20.669
Containment restored.
Propulsion at maximum efficiency.

29:20.806 --> 29:23.929
- Locate Data.
- Not on board the Enterprise.

29:24.063 --> 29:25.059
Explain.

29:25.190 --> 29:29.821
All personnel except the Captain and
First Officer have been evacuated.

29:29.949 --> 29:33.571
- Evacuated? Was it that critical?
- Yes.

29:33.707 --> 29:36.663
- Are we still at the star base?
- No.

29:36.796 --> 29:40.334
- Position report.
- Coordinates 4159.26

29:40.470 --> 29:43.557
by 81921 by 312.

29:43.685 --> 29:46.178
Heading 233, mark 45.

29:46.315 --> 29:47.430
Destination?

29:47.567 --> 29:50.239
Planet Bynaus
in the Beta Magellan system.

29:50.364 --> 29:51.480
The Bynars.

29:51.617 --> 29:54.371
Have the Bynars
stolen the Enterprise?

29:54.498 --> 29:56.907
That information is not available.

30:05.310 --> 30:07.720
It's the Bynars. You're part of this.

30:09.068 --> 30:12.904
- Yes.
- You were the lure to keep me here.

30:13.034 --> 30:17.914
Yes. When they saw your interest in
me they thought I could distract you.

30:18.044 --> 30:22.591
- That's Riker. What about me?
- That was a fortunate happenstance.

30:22.720 --> 30:25.724
- What do they want with me?
- Or the Enterprise?

30:25.851 --> 30:28.142
I'm not programmed to tell you that.

30:29.608 --> 30:33.444
Come on, Number One. We've got to
regain control of our ship.

30:39.962 --> 30:43.085
- OK, so what do we do?
- Which is the nearest vessel?

30:44.137 --> 30:47.841
- The Trieste.
- I know it. Too small, too slow.

30:47.978 --> 30:49.853
Plus, it's 66 hours away.

30:51.234 --> 30:53.063
Where are the Bynars?

30:55.200 --> 30:58.703
- I haven't seen them.
- Then they are still aboard.

30:58.833 --> 31:02.252
We must send a vessel
to intercept them at Bynaus.

31:02.381 --> 31:05.551
- They may head for there.
- What makes you think so?

31:06.681 --> 31:09.056
It is the best place
for us to start.

31:20.667 --> 31:22.293
Picard. Access.

31:29.643 --> 31:31.721
Captain's log, supplemental.

31:31.856 --> 31:35.774
We now know who has commandeered
the Enterprise. The Bynars.

31:35.906 --> 31:37.734
We can't contact the bridge.

31:37.868 --> 31:41.620
Cmdr Riker and I will now try
to regain control of our ship.

31:41.750 --> 31:43.579
- This way.
- To Engineering?

31:43.713 --> 31:47.845
Our first step. Verify containment
and initiate auto-destruct.

31:47.971 --> 31:49.800
Initiate auto-destruct?

31:49.933 --> 31:53.721
Our ship has been commandeered by
a force of unknown size and intent.

31:53.858 --> 31:56.731
We're here alone.
We must assume the worst.

31:59.577 --> 32:03.626
If we don't regain control,
no one else must have it either.

32:05.547 --> 32:09.679
This is the one decision that
requires us to be in total agreement.

32:09.806 --> 32:11.551
The time allotted concerns me.

32:11.684 --> 32:14.522
- There's no option.
- A five-minute countdown.

32:14.648 --> 32:19.196
Sufficient to get to the bridge
and shut off auto-destruct. Or not.

32:19.324 --> 32:22.531
This vessel must not fall
into hostile hands.

32:25.587 --> 32:27.047
Then let's set it and go.

32:30.764 --> 32:34.100
Recognize Picard, Jean-Luc, Captain.

32:34.229 --> 32:37.767
Recognize Riker,
William T, Commander.

32:39.155 --> 32:41.316
Set auto-destruct sequence.

32:41.451 --> 32:43.327
Does the First Officer concur?

32:44.791 --> 32:48.080
Yes.
Set auto-destruct sequence, now.

32:48.549 --> 32:53.096
Auto-destruct will detonate
in four minutes and 59 seconds.

32:58.568 --> 33:01.775
The only place to stop this
is on the bridge. Let's go.

33:03.369 --> 33:05.411
What do you make of this, sir?

33:08.212 --> 33:11.382
A huge amount of data
is being stored in the computer.

33:11.510 --> 33:15.013
- Just stored. Why?
- Another piece of this puzzle.

33:26.999 --> 33:30.087
- Bridge access denied.
- They locked it.

33:30.214 --> 33:33.171
- We need another way in.
- One of us could beam in.

33:33.303 --> 33:36.510
It takes too long to materialize.
You'd have no chance.

33:36.643 --> 33:39.564
I could beam into the turbo lift,
force the doors.

33:39.691 --> 33:44.156
No, we'll beam in simultaneously,
to different areas of the bridge.

33:44.283 --> 33:47.157
With luck,
one of us will be a distraction.

33:47.289 --> 33:49.248
There's only four minutes left.

33:50.754 --> 33:53.129
Still no response
from the Enterprise.

33:53.259 --> 33:56.963
They would answer if they could.
Someone else has control.

33:58.895 --> 34:00.724
Do you think I am responsible?

34:00.858 --> 34:04.194
Responsible?
How could you possibly have known?

34:04.323 --> 34:08.656
- My station is on the bridge.
- You can't be there every second.

34:08.790 --> 34:13.255
You are wrong, Geordi. I can.
I do not need rest or diversion.

34:14.301 --> 34:17.755
I should not have been painting.
I was negligent.

34:17.891 --> 34:19.886
It's a pointless discussion.

34:20.020 --> 34:23.606
You could have been there
and it still might have happened.

34:23.735 --> 34:26.942
Cmdr Quinteros.
You have three ships in here.

34:27.076 --> 34:30.364
- We need one of them now.
- We're rushing repairs.

34:30.498 --> 34:35.166
But it's 18 hours before one will be
ready. There's nothing you can do.

34:47.324 --> 34:50.530
Set coordinates for bridge -
port for me, aft for you.

34:50.664 --> 34:52.373
You're on pad two.

34:52.501 --> 34:54.376
I've set a ten-second delay.

34:57.260 --> 34:59.005
Set phasers on stun.

35:00.266 --> 35:02.724
Number One, good luck.

35:18.469 --> 35:20.048
Over here, Captain.

35:39.134 --> 35:40.963
Why did you steal my ship?

35:42.850 --> 35:44.476
Please...

35:45.564 --> 35:48.022
..try... to...

35:48.486 --> 35:51.359
..help... us.

36:12.742 --> 36:14.368
Cancel auto-destruct.

36:14.496 --> 36:16.787
Does the First Officer agree?

36:16.917 --> 36:18.329
Affirmative.

36:18.462 --> 36:20.421
Auto-destruct cancelled.

36:26.102 --> 36:29.308
We're in orbit around Bynaus.
How are they?

36:29.943 --> 36:34.360
They appear dead. Let's see if we can
get some answers from Bynaus.

36:37.666 --> 36:39.542
Their main computer is off.

36:39.670 --> 36:42.627
Sensors show
all their equipment is inert.

36:42.760 --> 36:45.170
They can neither send
nor receive messages.

36:45.306 --> 36:49.010
They depend on their computer.
Are they functioning?

36:49.147 --> 36:52.769
They're probably like
these Bynars here. Dying.

36:55.034 --> 36:58.702
Why did they steal our ship?
What is their purpose?

36:58.833 --> 37:03.499
They cleared computer space.
Let's see what they stored.

37:06.348 --> 37:10.646
Captain, it's enormous.
Every byte of free space is filled.

37:10.773 --> 37:14.905
They must have made a core-dump
from their world into our computer.

37:17.328 --> 37:18.954
I can't get in.

37:20.292 --> 37:22.203
I wish they'd left a note.

37:23.423 --> 37:26.095
- Maybe they did.
- Minuet.

37:35.614 --> 37:37.109
What's this all about?

37:37.242 --> 37:41.707
A star in the Bynar system went
supernova and they miscalculated.

37:41.834 --> 37:47.178
The pulse from the explosion was
going to knock out their computer.

37:47.303 --> 37:50.307
So they had to transfer
their stored information

37:50.435 --> 37:52.679
and shut down until it passed.

37:52.814 --> 37:57.481
And then reactivate their system
and transfer the information back.

37:57.615 --> 38:00.952
We have the only mobile computer
large enough.

38:01.080 --> 38:03.538
So what went wrong?
Why are they dying?

38:03.669 --> 38:06.507
The star went supernova
before it was expected.

38:06.633 --> 38:09.091
You were late
arriving at Star base 74.

38:11.392 --> 38:15.857
Why didn't they say something?
Why didn't they just ask for help?

38:15.985 --> 38:19.191
I don't know.
I don't have those answers.

38:19.325 --> 38:20.986
Is there anything we can do?

38:21.120 --> 38:25.501
Yes, return the data stored
on your computer back to Bynaus.

38:25.629 --> 38:27.540
- How?
- You don't know?

38:27.674 --> 38:30.678
Yes. If I had the filename,
but we don't. Do you?

38:30.806 --> 38:32.432
I don't know what you mean.

38:32.559 --> 38:36.727
They wouldn't intentionally hide it,
make it hard to find.

38:36.859 --> 38:41.360
- It must be right in front of us.
- Let's contact Star base 74.

38:41.493 --> 38:44.034
They're dying.
They meant you no harm.

38:44.165 --> 38:47.502
It was their world
they were trying to save.

38:47.630 --> 38:49.839
Help them, Will. Hurry.

38:50.762 --> 38:52.043
Please.

39:00.364 --> 39:04.745
Star base 74, this is the Enterprise.
Do you read me?

39:04.873 --> 39:08.079
This is Star base 74.
What is your situation?

39:08.213 --> 39:12.000
We'll go into that later.
I must speak to Lt. Cmdr Data.

39:12.137 --> 39:13.799
I'm here, sir.

39:13.932 --> 39:17.387
The Bynars have stored some material
in our computer.

39:17.523 --> 39:19.066
We need to access it.

39:19.193 --> 39:21.947
Access is available
by code or password.

39:22.073 --> 39:24.567
I know that, Data,
but what could it be?

39:24.703 --> 39:26.698
Filenames can be anything, sir.

39:27.918 --> 39:30.459
They want us to find it.
It would be simple.

39:30.590 --> 39:35.173
Then a name. Or a place.
It could be something personal.

39:35.308 --> 39:37.468
In this case, in binary language,

39:37.604 --> 39:40.941
which is ones and zeros
in groups of eight or 16.

39:41.069 --> 39:43.527
Would they have kept it that simple?

39:44.618 --> 39:46.659
Try it. Picard out.

39:58.770 --> 40:00.314
That's the file.

40:00.440 --> 40:02.981
Access the file. Start the transfer.

40:06.745 --> 40:08.704
So much for that idea.

40:09.458 --> 40:11.334
Let me take the other position.

40:13.341 --> 40:16.879
The Bynars always work in pairs.
Maybe that is required.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.442
It appears to be successful.

40:28.830 --> 40:34.505
Their system's started up. A resident
diagnostic program is running.

40:36.470 --> 40:39.593
Their system
is absolutely incredible.

41:03.398 --> 41:05.523
Our world is reactivated.

41:05.652 --> 41:08.490
Our people express their gratitude.

41:08.616 --> 41:10.575
We will return to your star base

41:10.704 --> 41:14.539
for whatever punishment
your system requires of us.

41:14.670 --> 41:16.795
Why didn't you just ask for help?

41:23.354 --> 41:25.265
You might have said no.

41:26.276 --> 41:28.485
There was a good chance
we'd say yes.

41:28.614 --> 41:31.024
Our need was too great
to risk rejection.

41:31.161 --> 41:32.906
And so you stole it.

41:34.208 --> 41:37.082
Their reason
was part of the binary thinking.

41:37.214 --> 41:42.095
For them, there are only two choices.
One or zero. Yes or no.

41:42.224 --> 41:44.100
Why lure me to the holodeck?

41:44.228 --> 41:46.187
Because we knew we might die.

41:46.316 --> 41:50.020
We needed someone to restore
our computer. And you did.

41:51.743 --> 41:55.531
No one has been hurt.
You have your planet back in order.

41:56.753 --> 41:58.379
We have our ship.

42:04.059 --> 42:07.977
Well,... it's been some time
since I had the conn.

42:09.611 --> 42:13.483
But not to worry, Number One,
you're in good hands.

42:14.705 --> 42:16.949
Star base 74,...

42:18.671 --> 42:20.297
..warp two.

42:21.593 --> 42:23.422
Engage.

42:29.442 --> 42:31.520
Everything's under control.

42:37.458 --> 42:40.961
USS Enterprise has cleared
the star base perimeter.

42:56.537 --> 42:59.327
- Is everything alright?
- All in order.

42:59.460 --> 43:03.128
But I want a complete check,
all systems, all divisions.

43:04.511 --> 43:07.550
- What about the Bynars?
- There will be a hearing.

43:07.684 --> 43:11.222
- We knew that would happen.
- Follow me, please.

43:12.819 --> 43:15.609
Permission to leave the bridge, sir?

43:15.742 --> 43:17.701
Permission granted.

43:27.473 --> 43:32.104
What is a knockout like you doing
in a computer-generated gin joint?

43:40.290 --> 43:42.201
You're not Minuet.

43:59.578 --> 44:00.990
She's gone.

44:02.876 --> 44:07.626
I tried variations of the program,
others appeared, but... not Minuet.

44:09.932 --> 44:13.220
Maybe it was all part of
the Bynars' programming.

44:13.355 --> 44:18.318
But you know, Number One,...
some relationships just can't work.

44:19.116 --> 44:21.788
Yes, probably true.

44:23.500 --> 44:25.542
She'll be difficult to forget.

44:26.305 --> 44:32.602
