00:10.724 --> 00:15.303
You'll like this apartment. My wife says it's
the best of the lot. The tenants moved out quick.

00:15.437 --> 00:19.387
I don't normally show apartments
before I've had a chance to look.

00:19.524 --> 00:21.517
So, use your imagination.

00:29.409 --> 00:31.865
Oh, my God. Call 911.

00:33.038 --> 00:36.703
I worked in a slaughterhouse one summer
that looked a lot like this.

00:37.876 --> 00:40.284
The lease is in the name of Clifford Renteria.

00:40.420 --> 00:43.125
Lived here with his girlfriend till they snuck out

00:43.257 --> 00:47.965
- Gee I wonder why
- For all we know, this is animal blood.

00:48.095 --> 00:50.052
Yean sure

00:50.180 --> 00:52.588
Deer, sheep, llama.

00:52.724 --> 00:55.215
Deer hunter comes home
from the mountains drunk.

00:55.352 --> 00:58.021
Decides to play butcher, clean his kill.

00:58.105 --> 01:01.556
Chops his game up into oven-size pieces
for the winter.

01:01.692 --> 01:03.400
What does he care? He's renting.

01:08.115 --> 01:09.823
The victim's human

01:10.993 --> 01:13.365
And a human has only eight pints of blood.

01:13.495 --> 01:17.327
So, whoever the victim is... is now dead.

01:51.617 --> 01:53.693
Any uniformity in the spray?

01:55.996 --> 01:57.407
Well by and large

01:57.539 --> 02:00.077
the average diameter's about one millimetre.

02:00.208 --> 02:04.289
Blood drops this size
are characteristic of high-velocity impact

02:04.421 --> 02:09.047
like gunshot trauma,
but there's no bullet strikes in the walls,

02:09.175 --> 02:11.215
ruling out murder by gun.

02:11.345 --> 02:14.630
Just acquaint yourself, Sara.
Don't interpret just yet.

02:20.228 --> 02:22.636
All right.

02:25.025 --> 02:26.140
Showtime.

02:34.576 --> 02:36.569
This looks like a multiple.

02:36.703 --> 02:38.696
More than one vic. Acquainting myself.

02:38.830 --> 02:41.784
Check out the voids.
That's the real evidence.

02:41.917 --> 02:43.162
Couch.

02:43.293 --> 02:46.128
We've only got 30 seconds
till this Luminol disappears.

02:49.925 --> 02:52.131

02:52.261 --> 02:53.505
Television, maybe.

02:54.721 --> 02:56.299
Magazine?

02:56.431 --> 02:57.974
Triangle.

02:59.142 --> 03:00.601
Coat rack?

03:00.727 --> 03:02.352
Guys.

03:07.442 --> 03:09.435
What do you think that is?

03:10.779 --> 03:13.187
Looks like it could be an electric saw.

03:16.076 --> 03:18.199
High-velocity small spray.

03:20.914 --> 03:23.666

Zero humidity. Record highs.
'Tis the season.

03:47.816 --> 03:50.141
- Hi.
- Hey.

03:50.277 --> 03:53.029
I don't even know where to start with this one.

03:53.155 --> 03:56.275
Take a look at that
A scuba diver up a tree

04:00.245 --> 04:01.905
Wow.

04:02.039 --> 04:03.996
How the hell did he get there?

04:06.043 --> 04:08.368
He couldn't climb with all that crap on

04:08.503 --> 04:10.496
He got up there somehow.

04:12.007 --> 04:15.174
Well, you know, Lake Mead is just over the hill

04:15.302 --> 04:17.176
and the copters are dropping water.

04:23.060 --> 04:24.435
You're serious?

04:25.896 --> 04:28.387
That's a total urban legend.

04:28.523 --> 04:30.516
We're scientists, Nicky.

04:30.651 --> 04:32.560
No way that happened.

04:32.694 --> 04:34.070
OK.

04:38.575 --> 04:40.615
And I suppose you believe in Santa.

04:42.204 --> 04:44.196
After today...

04:44.331 --> 04:45.706
oh, yeah.

04:47.542 --> 04:51.872
When I said Renteria and his girlfriend
skipped out in the middle of the night,

04:52.005 --> 04:55.208
- I didn't have the whole story.
- I haven't seen Alison in a month.

04:55.342 --> 04:59.589
- Any idea where she might be?
- Renteria said she left town.

04:59.721 --> 05:04.099
- So you noticed that she was gone?
- I manage the complex. I notice everything.

05:04.226 --> 05:06.764
Did you notice if Mr Renteria left an address?

05:06.895 --> 05:08.888
Just a letter saying he was moving on.

05:09.022 --> 05:13.768
If you find him, tell him he is not getting
his deposit back. The blood'll never come out.

05:13.902 --> 05:17.651
Hopefully not. It's all the evidence we have.

05:40.304 --> 05:42.676
What do you make of that void?

05:44.474 --> 05:45.755
Green vegetation

05:48.270 --> 05:51.520
There's a consistent burn over this whole area.

05:51.648 --> 05:53.771
Except for that one spot.

05:55.777 --> 05:59.193
The Chief says the original fire was a class C.
Downed power line.

05:59.323 --> 06:03.320
Winds keep shifting,
not spots breaking out all over.

06:05.120 --> 06:06.698
Well well.

06:06.830 --> 06:08.823
Downed power line, huh?

06:15.339 --> 06:16.833
Good eye.

06:16.965 --> 06:19.290
A matchbook time-delay device.

06:21.511 --> 06:24.049
Well, don't touch it. It'll disintegrate.

06:25.807 --> 06:28.595
That's the only reason I carry this stuff.

06:29.853 --> 06:33.056
Hairspray Extra hold

06:38.820 --> 06:41.987
Difference between walking and running.

06:42.115 --> 06:45.365
Guy lights a cigarette,
sticks it in a matchbook, takes a stroll.

06:49.581 --> 06:52.250
It buys an arsonist a five-minute head start.

06:52.376 --> 06:53.490
Mm-hm.

06:55.963 --> 06:59.663
Monaco Receiving.
Clifford Renteria, platform manager.

06:59.800 --> 07:03.667
Gee, Brass, all in one shift. I'm impressed.

07:03.804 --> 07:07.137
Are you Clifford Renteria?
- Cliff. Who are you?

07:09.351 --> 07:10.762
Las Vegas Police.

07:10.894 --> 07:16.399
Crime Lab. Do you have any knowledge
of the whereabouts of Alison Scott?

07:16.525 --> 07:19.395
She's in Canada visiting her parents. Why?

07:20.946 --> 07:22.938
We just came from your old apartment.

07:23.073 --> 07:27.901
We found some disturbing evidence there
Would you care to explain that?

07:28.036 --> 07:30.990
Hey, he had it coming. I'll tell you that right now.

07:31.123 --> 07:35.868
The apartment stank, there were flies
everywhere, no water... so I trashed the place.

07:36.003 --> 07:38.079
- Who had it coming?
- The manager.

07:38.213 --> 07:41.962
- The lazy bastard. It serves him right.
- Mr Renteria

07:42.092 --> 07:45.757
your apartment walls
are covered in human blood.

07:46.930 --> 07:48.804
- Are you aware of that?
- Yeah.

07:48.932 --> 07:51.637
- Do you have an explanation?
- It's my blood.

07:51.768 --> 07:54.141
- Your blood.
- You got a stigmata?

07:54.271 --> 07:56.643
No. I get nosebleeds.

07:56.773 --> 08:00.308
- Nosebleeds.
- From hepatitis C. I got blood to spare.

08:00.444 --> 08:04.572
My nose is like Old Faithful.
It finally came in handy.

08:04.698 --> 08:08.197
You expirated blood from your nose
all over your apartment walls

08:08.327 --> 08:09.702
to get back at your manager?

08:09.828 --> 08:12.663
Yeah. I hope it made his cleanup job hell.

08:12.789 --> 08:16.490
- That's not supposed to go anywhere.
- What? These ones here?

08:16.627 --> 08:18.370
Yean those

08:18.503 --> 08:23.130
This guy blows ten quarts of blood from his nose
onto his wall?

08:23.258 --> 08:25.298
You want to ask for a demonstration?

08:25.427 --> 08:27.005
He's lying.

08:27.137 --> 08:31.087
Expirating from your nose
would leave oval-shaped blood patterns.

08:31.224 --> 08:34.344
The ones we found in his apartment
were V-shaped.

08:35.520 --> 08:37.513
Mr Renteria.

08:40.400 --> 08:44.694
We're gonna need a sample of your blood.
From your arm, not your nose.

08:44.821 --> 08:46.613
And a visit to your new apartment.

08:47.866 --> 08:49.859
That's home to me now.

08:49.993 --> 08:52.663
Been staying there about a week

08:52.788 --> 08:54.864
Well, may we see your furniture?

08:54.998 --> 08:56.991
Sure.

09:07.552 --> 09:09.379
Electric saw

09:09.513 --> 09:11.505
Used to do some landscaping.

09:14.017 --> 09:16.010
It's an interesting lamp

09:19.273 --> 09:24.267
Mr Renteria, with your permission, I'd like
to move some of your property to my lab

09:24.403 --> 09:28.151
- for a closer inspection.
- Hey, save me $250 a week truck rental.

09:28.282 --> 09:31.697
Keep it as long as you want.
I'll sleep in the break room.

09:31.827 --> 09:35.278
And that's after you come down
and give us that blood sample.

09:43.213 --> 09:45.882
You checked Nosebleed's tools yet?

09:45.966 --> 09:48.042
No observable blood. Not even with Pheno.

09:49.219 --> 09:52.255
He probably ditched them
after he used them on the victim.

09:52.389 --> 09:54.346
We just gotta figure out which one.

09:54.975 --> 09:57.892
How long did Firearms give us these for?

09:58.020 --> 10:01.353
24 hours. Then we gotta give them back... clean.

10:02.524 --> 10:04.066
Let's do it.

10:04.985 --> 10:06.978
<i>THE CHARLATANS: Judas</i>

10:09.656 --> 10:13.524
<i>Ooh, can you tell me how you feel today?</i>

10:13.660 --> 10:16.068
<i>I found love</i>

10:16.204 --> 10:20.119
<i>Sweet, sweet music</i>

10:20.250 --> 10:22.622
<i>Can you tell me how you feel today?</i>

10:23.754 --> 10:24.785
<i>I found love</i>

10:26.840 --> 10:29.248
<i>Sweet southern bliss</i>

10:29.384 --> 10:31.958
<i>Ye-ah, ye-ah</i>

10:33.221 --> 10:34.217
So?

10:35.349 --> 10:36.594
DNA results.

10:36.725 --> 10:42.312
Erm... 16 samples from the apartment walls
and one we just took from the guy's arm.

10:47.194 --> 10:48.653
This cannot be right.

10:48.779 --> 10:51.234
Hey, I always double-check your stuff.

10:51.365 --> 10:54.781
- All the results point one way.
- What about the blood on the lamp?

10:54.910 --> 10:57.911
That is my next run. Just a little backlogged.

10:58.038 --> 11:00.114
Well, get through it.

11:01.959 --> 11:05.078
I thought you said the blood on those walls
couldn't be his.

11:05.212 --> 11:07.667
I also thought the metric system would catch on.

11:07.798 --> 11:11.167
Everything that starts with a faulty premise
is bound to fail.

11:11.301 --> 11:14.919
I saw V-patterns
and I foolishly ruled out the nose.

11:15.055 --> 11:18.506
I told you I had a condition.
Hepatitis C. I was diagnosed at 18.

11:18.642 --> 11:20.599
This relates to your magic nose how?

11:20.727 --> 11:25.223
Hepatitis C destroys the liver
and a whole host of clotting functions.

11:26.358 --> 11:29.027
Cliff indeed has blood to spare.

11:29.111 --> 11:31.399
Thanks for coming around to my side.

11:31.530 --> 11:33.522
Which way's out?

11:33.657 --> 11:36.029
Nobody released you.

11:36.159 --> 11:39.825
Mr Renteria, I can't sign off on a case
until I fully understand it.

11:39.955 --> 11:41.864
So let me get this straight.

11:41.999 --> 11:44.038
You had a beef with your landlord

11:44.167 --> 11:48.165
and you decided to pay him back
by blowing blood out of your nose

11:48.297 --> 11:50.373
all over the apartment walls.

11:50.507 --> 11:53.176
- Is that about right?
- Yeah.

11:53.302 --> 11:57.465
A day? A week? A couple of months?
How long did this take?

11:57.598 --> 12:00.349
I don't know. About a month.

12:00.475 --> 12:04.888
You get up, make some coffee and go,
"I'll blow some blood on the kitchen wall today."

12:05.022 --> 12:07.773
Get out of the shower,
grab your towel, go,

12:07.899 --> 12:11.683
"Hey, this looks like a nice spot
to expirate a couple of pints."

12:11.820 --> 12:13.195
It wasn't like that.

12:13.322 --> 12:16.655
Something would set me off.
The disposer was backed up. No hot water.

12:16.783 --> 12:20.651
The toilet was broken.
I knew the landlord wasn't gonna fix it.

12:21.830 --> 12:25.080
So you made your statement through your nose.

12:25.208 --> 12:27.367
I wasn't getting anywhere with words.

12:27.502 --> 12:31.749
Look, if it'll get me out of here any quicker,
I'll show you.

12:33.383 --> 12:35.376
Erm...

12:38.013 --> 12:40.006
It's really not that big a deal.

12:42.351 --> 12:43.845
(Clears throat)

12:44.978 --> 12:46.686
You might wanna back up.

12:49.524 --> 12:51.600
(Renteria expirates)

12:52.778 --> 12:55.020
Same high-velocity spray

12:56.198 --> 12:58.190
Same short V-pattern too.

12:58.325 --> 13:02.370
Didn't you say expirating through the nose
made oval patterns?

13:02.496 --> 13:06.908
Yeah, well, as it turns out,
our guy stands very close to the wall

13:07.042 --> 13:09.035
and blows almost sideways.

13:10.212 --> 13:12.418
This is on the real? You saw him do this?

13:12.547 --> 13:14.540
Right through his Jimmy Durante.

13:14.675 --> 13:16.632
Ambidextrous. Both nostrils.

13:16.760 --> 13:19.085
Great. Our big murder's a nosebleed.

13:19.221 --> 13:24.642
Oh, not necessarily. The sample
from the Nosebleed's lamp. It's not his blood.

13:24.768 --> 13:26.725
And I don't know whose blood it is,

13:26.853 --> 13:30.934
but the amelogenin came back
with something pretty interesting. XX.

13:31.066 --> 13:32.975
Female blood.

13:33.110 --> 13:37.273
- Our guy's girlfriend is still missing.
- That may have nothing to do with it.

13:37.406 --> 13:38.319
Or everything.

13:49.626 --> 13:51.619
So, you got an ID on the scuba guy?

13:51.753 --> 13:53.746
Jacques Cousteau.

13:54.923 --> 13:56.916
Kidding. Coroner humour.

13:58.093 --> 14:01.462
But I'll tell you what I do know.
He didn't die in that fire.

14:01.597 --> 14:04.763
No carboxyhaemoglobin in his blood

14:04.891 --> 14:07.264
He didn't inhale carbon monoxide.

14:07.394 --> 14:09.850
He stopped breathing before the fire started.

14:09.980 --> 14:12.186
Probably killed someplace else and dumped.

14:12.316 --> 14:16.183
Oh, he was dumped all right.
Out of a chopper. Right, Doctor?

14:16.320 --> 14:20.104
The victim's injuries are inconsistent
with a fall of that magnitude.

14:20.240 --> 14:24.617
No fracture of the pelvis,
no compression of the lumbar vertebrae.

14:24.745 --> 14:26.737
No shortening of the body.

14:28.290 --> 14:31.457
There goes your theory, Nick.
Good try, though.

14:32.628 --> 14:35.878
- So what was the cause of death?
- His heart stopped beating.

14:36.006 --> 14:40.335
Heart attack, consistent with
being scooped out of Lake Mead.

14:40.469 --> 14:44.169
The human heart beats
in a four-beat rhythm, like a foxtrot.

14:44.306 --> 14:48.719
The two atria contract, then the two ventricles.
Ba-boom, ba-boom.

14:48.852 --> 14:53.395
- So what happened to this guy?
- Commotio cordis. Cardiac concussion.

14:54.691 --> 14:57.361
The guy short-circuited. It's rare, but I've seen it.

14:57.486 --> 15:01.815
A few years ago a minor leaguer
took a line drive to the chest.

15:01.949 --> 15:04.274
Interrupted the impulse to the heart

15:04.409 --> 15:07.196
turning it into a bag of worms. Fibrillation.

15:07.329 --> 15:10.698
So, our scuba diver took one to the chest.

15:10.832 --> 15:11.828
Definitely.

15:11.959 --> 15:15.078
He could have been clipped
by the chopper's Bambi Bucket.

15:16.129 --> 15:20.459
Did you find anything between his toes,
like sand from...

15:20.592 --> 15:22.384
Lake Mead? Sorry Nick

15:22.511 --> 15:25.428
But I did find something
between him and his wet suit.

15:25.555 --> 15:28.426
Soap residue. Like he'd started to shower.

15:28.558 --> 15:31.096
Soaped up, never soaped off.

15:40.195 --> 15:42.235
Something on your mind, Greg?

15:42.364 --> 15:46.112
Oh, it's... I heard about your case.
Sounds interesting.

15:46.243 --> 15:48.235
Yeah.

15:48.370 --> 15:50.493
Hey, you wanna make yourself useful?

15:50.622 --> 15:52.615
Drop this off at Trace.

15:52.749 --> 15:55.786
Must be some kind of soap.
Robbins got me halfway there.

15:55.919 --> 15:58.244
Bet it's liquid dishwashing soap.

15:58.380 --> 16:00.040
Yeah? State your source.

16:01.216 --> 16:04.252
I used to do a little diving myself, actually.

16:04.386 --> 16:05.964
Belize, Maui,

16:06.096 --> 16:08.468
Great Barrier Reef.

16:10.017 --> 16:12.590
OK, maybe I took that one a little too far.

16:12.728 --> 16:16.512
But the point is that these rubber suits
aren't very easy to put on.

16:16.648 --> 16:19.649
Neoprene and skin need a little romance
to get together.

16:19.776 --> 16:22.102
A capful of liquid soap works like a charm.

16:25.907 --> 16:28.481
So, you wanna check the safety valve?

16:28.619 --> 16:30.991
It's sealed closed.

16:31.121 --> 16:34.241
- And what about the pressure gauge?
- Hose melted.

16:34.374 --> 16:36.782
Catherine found it at the base of the tree.

16:36.918 --> 16:39.919
It's 3,000 psi. That tank was full.

16:40.047 --> 16:44.127
Guess it was like anything pressurised.
These things blow for one of two reasons -

16:44.259 --> 16:46.797
too much air or too much heat.

16:51.433 --> 16:54.351
- You just made yourself useful, my friend.
- Yeah?

16:54.478 --> 16:56.351
- Oh, yeah.
- How?

16:57.898 --> 16:59.890
What are we looking for exactly?

17:00.025 --> 17:02.730
Same thing we always look for.
Evidence of a crime.

17:02.861 --> 17:07.273
- Failing that, we have to release the apartment.
- What about the missing girlfriend?

17:07.406 --> 17:11.701
Brass got a hold of Alison Scott's parents
in Canada. They said she never arrived.

17:11.828 --> 17:14.498
They had no idea
she was even going to see them.

17:19.752 --> 17:23.169
What if Nose Man blew blood
all over these walls

17:23.298 --> 17:25.290
to cover up Alison Scott's blood?

17:44.361 --> 17:46.354
I don't see any evidence of that.

17:46.488 --> 17:49.524
- You're not finding another layer of blood?
- No.

17:49.658 --> 17:52.231
You don't think maybe he offed his girlfriend?

17:52.369 --> 17:54.362
(Flies buzzing)

17:57.833 --> 18:00.121
How many flies do you count in this room?

18:05.299 --> 18:06.876
15, give or take.

18:08.010 --> 18:10.501
I counted four
on my first walk-through

18:12.139 --> 18:13.681
Fly spots

18:13.807 --> 18:15.598
Regurgitations.

18:29.114 --> 18:30.312
Fresh.

18:31.450 --> 18:33.074
The problem is,

18:33.201 --> 18:35.609
flies don't feast on dry blood

18:35.746 --> 18:39.115
The place is sealed
and they don't spontaneously generate.

18:39.249 --> 18:41.325
So they're feeding on fresh blood.

18:44.463 --> 18:47.629
Could be a rodent, though. Or bad garbage.

18:47.758 --> 18:51.292
Or something higher up the food chain,
like Alison Scott.

19:03.190 --> 19:05.182
(Flies buzzing)

19:06.443 --> 19:09.397
The preponderance of flies
is in this room

19:09.529 --> 19:13.823
They can egress a space
less than .001 centimetres.

19:15.410 --> 19:16.739
Behind you.

19:16.870 --> 19:18.863
Vent.

19:27.089 --> 19:28.749
Hey! Coffee boy!

19:28.882 --> 19:31.005
Where's my DNA? Cigarette butt?

19:31.134 --> 19:34.503
Matchbook time-delay device?
Hairspray? Any of this sound familiar?

19:34.638 --> 19:39.347
Bags under the eyes, coffee cup, stressed face.
Any of this look familiar?

19:40.811 --> 19:42.519
I'm working on it.

19:42.646 --> 19:45.481
Did Grissom put his stuff in front of mine?

19:45.607 --> 19:47.101
No.

19:47.234 --> 19:49.357
I'm working on your case... with Nick.

19:54.283 --> 19:56.655
I just talked with your partner.

19:56.785 --> 19:59.027
- You're working this case without me?
- Hm?

19:59.162 --> 20:00.443
Greg Sanders.

20:00.580 --> 20:02.953
Let go of my Grego.

20:03.083 --> 20:05.206
He's a CSI wannabe. Please.

20:05.335 --> 20:08.040
Check out the bottom of this tank.

20:09.756 --> 20:12.674
- Fissure.
- We had a little explosion here.

20:13.802 --> 20:15.296
That explains a lot

20:15.429 --> 20:17.836
(Fizzing)

20:17.973 --> 20:20.678
Acid etching. Not bad.

20:20.809 --> 20:25.886
If I get the tank serial number, I could talk to
surf shops, track the renter through a credit card.

20:26.023 --> 20:28.395
Pretty smart thinking there

20:28.525 --> 20:30.399
partner.

20:31.653 --> 20:33.562
Well, we still haven't ID'd the vic,

20:33.697 --> 20:36.366
but it's worth a snot

20:40.454 --> 20:43.823
OK N4002 let's see what kind of lead you are

20:43.957 --> 20:45.749
(Doorbell)

20:45.876 --> 20:48.711
Hi. Whatever you're selling, I have no interest.

20:48.837 --> 20:51.708
Maybe you should find out
what we're selling first.

20:53.133 --> 20:55.671
I'm Catherine Willows, Las Vegas Crime Lab.

20:55.802 --> 20:58.756
Detective O'Riley.
Is there a Jerry Walden lives here?

20:58.889 --> 21:00.846
You're looking at him.

21:03.644 --> 21:06.763
- What?
- Are you missing a scuba tank?

21:12.527 --> 21:13.772
Come in.

21:16.239 --> 21:20.948
Let me get this straight, Mr Walden.
You lent Bruce Skeller a spare tank?

21:21.078 --> 21:22.904
(Sighs) Yeah.

21:24.081 --> 21:27.247
I just...
I can't believe what you're telling me here.

21:27.376 --> 21:29.368
Bruce was an experienced diver.

21:30.504 --> 21:32.959
Well, he didn't exactly die in the water.

21:36.760 --> 21:39.880
Bruce and I
were about to break ground on this project.

21:40.013 --> 21:41.638
It really meant a lot to him

21:41.765 --> 21:43.473
You were in business together?

21:43.600 --> 21:46.387
Oh, we've been best friends since we were kids.

21:46.520 --> 21:48.263
We used to

21:48.397 --> 21:52.264
We used to build these forts together,
like our imaginary casino.

21:52.401 --> 21:55.188
Now we're gonna build the real thing.

21:55.320 --> 21:58.772
Partner up with this big development
company - Adventures...

21:58.907 --> 22:00.070
Excuse me.

22:00.200 --> 22:03.154
You said that Mr Skeller
was an experienced diver.

22:03.287 --> 22:05.244
Why would he be borrowing a tank?

22:05.372 --> 22:09.915
Someone being experienced
doesn't make them any less of a freeloader.

22:10.043 --> 22:12.332
Oh, you know, he was just down on his luck.

22:12.462 --> 22:15.214
We were like brothers. We shared everything.

22:15.340 --> 22:18.010
What was mine was his.
What was his was mine.

22:18.093 --> 22:20.002
You said he didn't have anything.

22:20.137 --> 22:22.509
Well yean but he would nave you know

22:22.639 --> 22:26.969
And I kept telling him that That's what
kept him going And then this happened

22:27.102 --> 22:29.308
There used to be something here.

22:29.438 --> 22:31.929
Oh, yeah, that's my coffee table.

22:32.065 --> 22:34.354
Interesting furniture. What is that?

22:34.484 --> 22:36.975
- Ash wood?
Yean

22:37.112 --> 22:38.275
And the coffee table?

22:38.405 --> 22:40.611
Made them out of the same piece of wood.

22:40.741 --> 22:44.785
- Where is the coffee table?
- I sent it out to get it refinished.

22:44.911 --> 22:47.782
The guy said it would be back in a week

22:50.208 --> 22:51.288
I er...

22:54.671 --> 22:57.162
...think it needed a little more than that.

23:06.016 --> 23:07.296
Fly egg casings.

23:09.603 --> 23:12.141
I thought I heard some banging around.

23:12.272 --> 23:14.265
You er you find my tenant?

23:14.399 --> 23:17.851
You can contact Captain Brass
for that information, sir.

23:19.780 --> 23:20.978
- Here, sir.
- Oh.

23:25.160 --> 23:26.488
What have you got?

23:26.620 --> 23:28.909
Either Paul or John.

23:29.039 --> 23:30.533
Very important beetle.

23:30.666 --> 23:32.575
The most important.

23:32.709 --> 23:36.493
The silphid beetle.
Typically feeds on decomposing human flesh.

23:36.630 --> 23:38.504
There's a dead body in here.

23:38.632 --> 23:44.884
Mr Evans, could you get permission
from the owner to let us break into these walls?

23:45.013 --> 23:47.683
Our original warrant didn't cover that

23:47.808 --> 23:50.096
It depends. How many walls and what for?

23:50.227 --> 23:52.219
We can't divulge that.

23:52.354 --> 23:54.845
But it may be all the walls.

23:54.982 --> 23:58.066
- In every room?
- Yeah.

23:58.193 --> 24:00.399
You CSIs gonna pay for the replastering?

24:01.571 --> 24:03.445
We don't do that.

24:03.573 --> 24:06.111
You can submit a form to the city
for reimbursement.

24:06.243 --> 24:08.734
Yeah, I'm still waiting for my tax rebate.

24:08.870 --> 24:14.031
I don't have to bother the owner with this.
He's not gonna let you bust out these walls.

24:16.795 --> 24:18.075
Now what?

24:18.213 --> 24:20.289
DNA lab.

24:20.424 --> 24:23.093
I don't want to hear any rumours
that Paul is dead.

24:23.176 --> 24:26.296
He may be the only chance we have
of getting in these walls.

24:26.430 --> 24:29.799
We already know this beetle
feeds only off of human blood,

24:29.933 --> 24:32.507
so why are we extracting its stomach contents?

24:32.644 --> 24:36.808
Ah, not so. According to Grissom, Mr Bug Guy,
the silphid beetle

24:36.940 --> 24:40.558
will actually feed
on any decomposing mammal, so...

24:40.694 --> 24:44.526
we need to show human DNA
or we are not gonna get a warrant

24:44.656 --> 24:46.696
to break down those walls.

24:46.825 --> 24:49.660
I hope he got his grub on
before you guys grabbed him up.

24:49.786 --> 24:52.075
Where's Greg? We need to get this processed.

24:52.205 --> 24:54.328
I swear he has a second job somewhere else.

24:59.838 --> 25:02.625
I'm er... all for being alone, but...

25:02.758 --> 25:05.924
- Did you bring the file?
- Well, there goes the foreplay.

25:06.053 --> 25:08.176
It's in the car. I hope you appreciate

25:08.305 --> 25:12.089
that even as district engineer
it wasn't easy getting the land deed.

25:12.225 --> 25:15.891
I know how you love a challenge.
What did the property sell for?

25:16.021 --> 25:18.594
Half a million bucks an acre.

25:18.732 --> 25:21.104
Is there anything else you need to use me for?

25:21.234 --> 25:23.227
Wh... Excuse me?

25:23.362 --> 25:27.490
You're not here for me, you're here for yourself,
so let's not waste time.

25:27.616 --> 25:31.199
The property was owned by two men -
Jerry Walden and Bruce Skeller.

25:31.328 --> 25:34.779
At the time they bought it, it was a steal.
50 grand an acre.

25:34.915 --> 25:39.577
Two years later, Adventures Development
starts buying up the surrounding parcels.

25:39.711 --> 25:41.787
Your guys hold out... until last week.

25:41.922 --> 25:44.045
And let me tell you, they got top dollar.

25:44.174 --> 25:48.966
A capitalist's wet dream. Buy low, sell high.
So, they played it smart.

25:49.096 --> 25:50.294
Well, one of them did.

25:50.430 --> 25:54.428
Jerry Walden was for selling from the get-go.
But his partner, well...

25:54.559 --> 25:56.636
that was a different deal altogether.

25:56.770 --> 25:59.641
He was a die-hard environmentalist,
a real tree-hugger.

25:59.773 --> 26:01.979
Mm. You can say that again.

26:02.109 --> 26:06.735
He saw the writing on the wall. The urbanisation
of Lake Mead. He tried to fight it, but...

26:06.863 --> 26:11.276
when it's money versus the environment,
it's no big surprise who's gonna win.

26:11.410 --> 26:13.901
So, is there anything else I can do for you?

26:15.747 --> 26:17.621
I'll see ya.

26:20.377 --> 26:26.000
This really frosts my lizard. I go to the lake to get
away from the casinos. There goes jet skiing.

26:26.133 --> 26:28.458
- What about the land deed, Ronnie?
- Hm?

26:28.594 --> 26:31.001
Oh. What I can tell you about that is er...

26:31.138 --> 26:34.803
I'm impressed.
If it is a forgery, it's a great forgery.

26:34.933 --> 26:37.507
Van Gogh. Nothing I can testify to.

26:38.937 --> 26:41.096
What can you testify to?

26:41.231 --> 26:43.687
Have you seen my VSC-4 machine?

26:43.817 --> 26:44.980
No.

26:51.783 --> 26:54.618
The original copy of the land sale agreement,
OK?

26:55.787 --> 26:59.370
Inks luminesce at different wavelengths.

27:01.293 --> 27:04.958
At one wavelength,
the signature on the left disappears.

27:05.088 --> 27:08.457
At another wavelength
the one on the right disappears

27:08.592 --> 27:10.252
Where did it go?

27:13.138 --> 27:15.131
What does it mean Ronnie?

27:15.265 --> 27:18.966
Whatever you make of it.
You've got a legal document.

27:19.102 --> 27:22.436
Two signatures notarised. The whole nine yards.

27:22.564 --> 27:27.273
The only thing I can tell you is your two guys...
used separate pens.

27:32.699 --> 27:33.980
Excuse me.

27:35.160 --> 27:36.654
Yeah.

27:36.787 --> 27:40.619
Er... silphid beetle.
Test for presence of human DNA.

27:44.795 --> 27:46.419
Is this definitive?

27:46.546 --> 27:48.338
Yes, sir.

27:52.803 --> 27:54.427
(Door opens)

27:54.554 --> 27:56.013
Do we get our warrant?

27:56.139 --> 28:00.007
Beetle was full of human DNA.
Brass got us a judge.

28:05.148 --> 28:07.639
Let's go knock down some walls.

28:24.835 --> 28:26.827
(Coughs)

28:28.005 --> 28:30.756
One wall down. 15 to go.

28:31.925 --> 28:36.137
Sorry to interrupt your fun.
But I have someone here you might like to meet.

28:37.723 --> 28:39.596
Jimmy Durante's girlfriend.

28:42.102 --> 28:43.596
You're Alison Scott?

28:43.729 --> 28:46.813
I see Cliff's been showing off again.

28:46.940 --> 28:48.933
It's one of the reasons I left him.

28:49.067 --> 28:50.443
You left him?

28:50.569 --> 28:53.060
I went back to my old boyfriend in Chicago.

28:53.196 --> 28:58.617
Miss Scott, er... we found some blood
on one of Cliff's lamps.

28:58.744 --> 29:01.413
I stubbed my toe on that lamp, like, once a week.

29:01.538 --> 29:05.832
I begged Cliff not to buy that thing,
but... he never listens.

29:05.959 --> 29:11.001
Would you be amenable to providing us with
a sample of your blood for comparison?

29:11.131 --> 29:12.673
Sure...

29:12.799 --> 29:15.587
but I'm telling you that's my blood.

29:15.719 --> 29:18.008
Look, Cliff's... He's a lot of things,

29:18.138 --> 29:20.178
but he's not a murderer.

29:20.307 --> 29:24.007
Yeah, I still want a sample. Warrick, would you?

29:24.144 --> 29:25.769
Er, yeah.

29:38.659 --> 29:39.607
(Sighs)

29:39.743 --> 29:42.946
You never get a second chance
to make a first impression.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.788
A square of nine dots on paper,

29:44.915 --> 29:47.951
and you can only draw four lines
to connect them...

29:50.087 --> 29:52.625
without the pen ever leaving the paper

29:56.260 --> 29:57.458
Right.

29:58.971 --> 30:00.963
Think outside the box.

30:11.275 --> 30:13.267
(Doorbell rings)

30:25.622 --> 30:27.615
Yeah? What do you want now?

30:27.749 --> 30:29.742
We need to take a look at your wall.

30:42.556 --> 30:43.718
Hey, yo, Cat!

30:48.395 --> 30:50.601
I'm going to forget you called me that.

30:50.731 --> 30:53.767
Sorry. Um...

30:53.900 --> 30:57.104
I've got a full profile on our... your torch.

30:57.237 --> 30:59.230
I pulled his DNA off of a cigarette butt.

30:59.364 --> 31:01.736
Lucky for us he's a wet-lipped smoker.

31:02.909 --> 31:05.447
You've done your job. I gotta go do mine.

31:05.579 --> 31:08.496
Just give me someone to compare it to.

31:08.624 --> 31:11.578
The ash wood splinters
are from Scuba Guy's back?

31:11.710 --> 31:13.916
Mm-nm Embedded in his aconeus muscle

31:14.046 --> 31:16.881
After you paged me,
I had Robbins comb his body.

31:18.008 --> 31:22.006
They only get us something
if they match Walden's Ninja coffee table.

31:24.431 --> 31:26.424
It's your theory.

31:30.354 --> 31:32.346
Radial chains align

31:32.481 --> 31:34.354
Pores match

31:34.483 --> 31:37.152
Two pieces of ash wood. One source.

31:37.235 --> 31:41.316
So, Walden and Skeller get into an argument,
probably over their land.

31:41.448 --> 31:43.571
Buy yourself 100 acres of rainforest.

31:43.700 --> 31:45.740
- Cash in your end!
- I'm not gonna sell!

31:45.869 --> 31:49.487
He pushes Skeller,
he falls back onto the ash wood table.

31:49.623 --> 31:53.573
That's not what killed Skeller.
Robbins said he took a line drive to the chest.

31:53.710 --> 31:55.335
The push escalates to a punch.

31:55.462 --> 31:57.371
God, you are so...

31:58.298 --> 32:00.457
I'll call O'Riley.

32:00.592 --> 32:03.759
Scented candles, huh?
- Food went rotten.

32:03.887 --> 32:05.963
I wanted to cover the smell.

32:06.098 --> 32:09.597
You've replastered this wall recently?
- Rain damage

32:09.726 --> 32:12.561
Funnelled down. Wrecked a five-foot area.

32:12.688 --> 32:14.265
Oh.

32:21.071 --> 32:24.985
You wouldn't mind if I... examined your vent,
would you?

32:25.117 --> 32:26.908
(Door opens)

32:27.035 --> 32:29.075
You don't have to ask his permission.

32:29.204 --> 32:31.909
I got a new warrant that covers this apartment.

32:32.040 --> 32:36.370
Your wife being missing put it over.
Funny you didn't mention that before.

32:45.178 --> 32:49.757
Did you know that your apartment shares
heating ducts with the apartment next door?

32:49.891 --> 32:53.343
Yeah, me and Cliff always fought
about the temperature. So what?

33:06.491 --> 33:08.484
- Sara.
- Yeah.

33:23.050 --> 33:25.042
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

33:35.646 --> 33:36.926
Alklyd.

33:37.064 --> 33:39.056
There's blood on the blanket

33:41.151 --> 33:44.235
And dermestid maculatus.

33:44.363 --> 33:47.696
That's Latin for
"You're hiding a dead body."

33:47.824 --> 33:51.158
What's the matter? You didn't realise
how bad a corpse can smell,

33:51.286 --> 33:53.279
so you decided to move it around?

33:54.790 --> 33:57.197
You can tell us where the body is or we can...

33:58.251 --> 34:01.169
...tear your place apart piece by piece.

34:01.296 --> 34:03.538
Whichever

34:03.674 --> 34:05.334
Look, you got squat.

34:06.468 --> 34:11.463
Jerry and Bruce signed with different pens,
you found a cigarette butt at Lake Mead

34:11.598 --> 34:13.425
and wood chips on a tree-hugger.

34:13.558 --> 34:18.054
Bottom line, you got a dead guy up a tree
and you don't know how he got there.

34:18.188 --> 34:20.097
I'm just here to make the arrest.

34:20.232 --> 34:22.355
- For what? What have you got?
- Plenty.

34:22.484 --> 34:24.856
Why don't we just start from the beginning?

34:24.987 --> 34:27.393
Bruce Skeller didn't die in any fire.

34:27.531 --> 34:29.405
He was killed...

34:29.533 --> 34:31.407
at your house.

34:32.786 --> 34:36.155
He didn't pick up any ash splinters
from that forest.

34:36.290 --> 34:38.282
It's all telarosa and oak out there.

34:38.417 --> 34:40.409
You had a dead body

34:40.543 --> 34:43.460
so you decided to get creative.

34:43.588 --> 34:47.966
Fire season, wet suit, liquid soap.

34:50.429 --> 34:53.547
You drove out to the lake, dumped the body...

34:58.312 --> 34:59.640
...and lit up.

35:01.982 --> 35:04.140
Not cos you wanted a cigarette.

35:04.276 --> 35:06.268
You lit up with a purpose.

35:09.364 --> 35:11.404
This gave you a head start.

35:11.533 --> 35:13.858
My guess is around the five-minute mark.

35:17.789 --> 35:21.039
You figured the fire department
would label it a hot spot,

35:21.168 --> 35:23.160
relate it to the original fire,

35:23.295 --> 35:25.750
and the body would just burn up.

35:25.881 --> 35:29.297
It doesn't explain how Bruce's body
wound up in that tree.

35:29.426 --> 35:31.751
I didn't put him there.

35:31.887 --> 35:32.883
Actually...

35:34.431 --> 35:36.258
...you did.

35:36.391 --> 35:42.097
You see, the thing you forgot about a scuba tank
is it contains compressed air.

35:42.230 --> 35:44.603
Too much neat and

35:44.733 --> 35:46.275
kaboom!

36:04.127 --> 36:06.120
(Nick exhales)

36:07.255 --> 36:09.248
- Rocket man!
- Yeah.

36:09.383 --> 36:11.174
Gotta love this job.

36:26.483 --> 36:28.939
I got a hollow section.

36:33.031 --> 36:35.024
Let's open it up.

36:52.718 --> 36:54.509
Damn!

36:54.636 --> 36:57.306
Are we in the wrong apartment again?

36:59.141 --> 37:01.133
I don't know.

37:01.268 --> 37:04.601
I don't mind being wrong,
I just don't think I am this time.

37:06.398 --> 37:09.565
OK... start on the floorboards.

37:09.693 --> 37:11.520
I'm going outside.

37:11.653 --> 37:13.646
(Counts to himself)

37:28.795 --> 37:30.171
You OK?

37:30.297 --> 37:31.921
95.

37:32.049 --> 37:33.459
Excuse me?

37:34.927 --> 37:38.509
Normally my pulse is T0. When it gets to 95
I realise how mad I am.

37:38.639 --> 37:42.886
- I have ten people working round the clock.
- You're too hard on yourself.

37:43.018 --> 37:46.636
I'm not mad at me There's a body in there
and that guy knows where.

37:46.772 --> 37:49.179
What's your pulse at now?

37:53.862 --> 37:58.358
You wanna... take a walk around the block?
Get some air?

37:58.492 --> 38:01.908
- No.
- Clear your head.

38:04.790 --> 38:06.699
I'm fine.

38:06.833 --> 38:08.826
OK.

38:15.509 --> 38:17.501
Chalk... from plaster.

38:17.636 --> 38:19.628
Oh.

38:23.976 --> 38:25.684
Better go wash up.

38:59.469 --> 39:01.261
Hey, Brass.

39:02.889 --> 39:05.559
When did the schnozz say he lost his hot water?

39:05.684 --> 39:07.641
He wasn't exact.

39:07.769 --> 39:10.806
You er... have no pressure for your hot water.

39:10.939 --> 39:13.609
I got a plumber coming Saturday.

39:13.734 --> 39:18.526
My Uncle Herb was a plumber. I might be able
to help. Where's your installation?

39:18.655 --> 39:21.656
Er, basement, but really, I got a plumber coming.

39:30.792 --> 39:32.785
You got an electrician coming too?

39:37.174 --> 39:39.213
A filtration system

39:39.343 --> 39:41.169
It softens the water.

39:41.303 --> 39:43.794
I got a guy on retainer.
You don't have to do this.

39:43.931 --> 39:45.888
Yeah, well, I'm non-union.

39:46.016 --> 39:48.685
There's no disruption to the cold water line.

39:48.769 --> 39:50.975
Hot water line

39:51.104 --> 39:56.312
Water runs through the filtration tanks first
and the water heater second.

39:56.443 --> 39:57.771
- Right?
- Yeah.

40:00.238 --> 40:02.231
Why is it bypassed?

40:06.161 --> 40:09.945
You've cut off the water for the filtration tank s.

40:10.082 --> 40:13.332
Something's wrong with it. I had no choice.

40:18.006 --> 40:19.999
(Solid thudding)

40:21.176 --> 40:26.716
Brine tanks are usually hollow. They only have
about eight inches of water for the salt mixture.

40:29.393 --> 40:31.101
(Solid thudding)

40:32.271 --> 40:34.062
Does that sound hollow to you?

40:46.952 --> 40:48.944
Not enough candles in the world.

40:53.083 --> 40:54.874
She nagged me.

41:02.009 --> 41:03.717
She nagged you?

41:11.852 --> 41:13.928
Hey, you wanna grab some breakfast?

41:14.062 --> 41:17.562
- No, thanks.
- Come on We always get better service

41:17.691 --> 41:20.526
- with you there
- I'm having breakfast with a friend.

41:20.652 --> 41:22.859
You're keeping him alive

41:24.072 --> 41:26.907
Sara said you guys already solved the case.

41:27.034 --> 41:28.444
He did.

41:30.996 --> 41:32.574
All right.
