01:21.748 --> 01:23.417
You stink.

01:24.451 --> 01:26.453
Why'd you turn down that job?

01:26.653 --> 01:27.754
What job?

01:27.955 --> 01:29.723
The job I dreamed Lee lacocca
offered you...

01:29.923 --> 01:31.825
...when he came into the shoe store.

01:32.326 --> 01:34.228
You're mad at me
for something I did in a dream?

01:35.395 --> 01:37.564
Well, you don't do anything
when I'm awake.

01:46.073 --> 01:49.510
Al, put down the book,
I'm going to sleep.

01:52.312 --> 01:53.814
Why don't you get a second job?

01:54.014 --> 01:57.017
You know, lots of families
are two-income families.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.987
You see, Peg, two incomes
means that two people...

02:00.187 --> 02:02.723
...you know, in the same family, work.

02:04.024 --> 02:06.660
Well, I don't have two husbands
in this family.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.095
Oh, come on, Al.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.663
It would just mean you have to work
eight hours more a day.

02:10.864 --> 02:12.766
I mean, you waste more time
than that sleeping.

02:15.102 --> 02:17.037
Peg, see my face?

02:17.504 --> 02:20.774
This is the face of a man
who sells shoes all day long.

02:21.408 --> 02:24.077
Now look at my face the way
it would look if I had another job.

02:31.251 --> 02:33.187
Well, I can live with that.

02:33.687 --> 02:34.688
Oh, come on, honey.

02:34.888 --> 02:37.090
If you don't do it for me,
just think of Kelly and Bud.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.226
Aren't they worth
another eight hours?

02:39.693 --> 02:41.161
Kids!

02:46.166 --> 02:47.868
The defence rests.

02:48.468 --> 02:49.870
Get out.

02:50.771 --> 02:51.772
To conclude:

02:51.972 --> 02:54.107
You can stab me with knives.
You can beat me with clubs.

02:54.274 --> 02:56.643
You can make me open my eyes
while we're having sex.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.982
But believe me, Peg,
there is nothing you can do or say...

03:02.182 --> 03:04.852
...that will ever make me consider
getting another job.

03:06.954 --> 03:10.257
Oh, I forgot to tell you, honey.
I joined the Record-of-the-Month Club...

03:10.457 --> 03:13.527
...so we have to cut back
on a few household expenses.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.796
Dad, the phone's dead!

03:15.996 --> 03:18.065
Don't worry, I'll call them.

03:29.243 --> 03:31.745
- Yeah?
- I came for the job.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.313
It can get rough.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.716
I played high school football.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.219
- So you think you can handle it?
- What do you think?

03:41.822 --> 03:43.290
Let's give it a try.

03:50.697 --> 03:52.966
Bathroom's in there. Good luck.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.440
Get that too.

04:04.545 --> 04:06.313
Boy, to be a private eye.

04:06.513 --> 04:08.715
Babes and bullets flying around
everywhere.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.684
Good chance that
one of them might hit you.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.320
I'd be a great private eye. Yup.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.489
Al Bundy, trouble is my business.

04:15.689 --> 04:18.559
I carry a mop.
I clean a detective's bathroom.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.360
Oh, God!

04:28.869 --> 04:30.704
Mr. Dallas?

04:41.148 --> 04:43.217
I want to live.

04:47.020 --> 04:51.158
- What?
- No... I said my name is Al Bundy.

04:51.358 --> 04:53.160
I'm Jack Dallas' new partner.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.662
Sit down and show me your tail.
I mean, tell me...

04:55.863 --> 04:57.030
Tell me your tale.

04:58.398 --> 05:01.101
It all started a few months ago.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.103
She was a sultry dame.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.807
Dressed to the nines,
except for a pair of cheap pumps.

05:07.374 --> 05:09.376
And man, was she a look er.

05:09.576 --> 05:12.646
She had more curves
than the Matterhorn at Disneyland.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.282
And there didn't appear
to be any Japanese tourists...

05:15.482 --> 05:18.385
...standing in line ahead of me,
waiting for the ride.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.056
She was some dish...

05:23.257 --> 05:25.225
...hot as my neighbour's dinner.

05:25.425 --> 05:27.494
By the way,
why don't I ever eat dinner?

05:29.096 --> 05:30.664
Oh, well, that's another case.

05:31.398 --> 05:33.934
Oh, my God, she's crossing her legs.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.671
So, what do you think, Mr. Bundy?

05:38.472 --> 05:39.940
What?

05:40.707 --> 05:41.975
About my problem.

05:42.976 --> 05:45.045
I guess I should have been listening.

05:47.881 --> 05:50.384
How would a real PI handle this?

05:50.584 --> 05:51.552
I know.

05:52.019 --> 05:52.986
What?

05:53.554 --> 05:57.558
My uncle, the great explorer,
Colonel Franklin Van Pelt...

05:57.758 --> 05:59.793
...is about to bequeath
the famous diamond...

05:59.993 --> 06:03.330
...known as the Pharaoh's Eye
to a member of my family.

06:03.530 --> 06:07.301
I know he's going to leave it to me.
So do all of my other relatives.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.736
I need you
to be at the family ceremony...

06:09.937 --> 06:11.638
...and protect me in my bequest.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.774
Will you take the case, Mr. Bundy?

06:14.541 --> 06:16.243
Cross your legs the other way, baby.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.351
Mr. Bundy?

06:24.685 --> 06:25.619
What?

06:26.086 --> 06:28.355
The case, will you take it?

06:28.555 --> 06:30.424
I need your help desperately.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.759
I wanted to tell her the truth...

06:32.960 --> 06:35.662
...but one look
into her troubled thighs...

06:36.797 --> 06:39.333
...and I knew I had to play this out
to the bitter end.

06:39.533 --> 06:42.169
Or at least until I saw some hooter.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.976
I don't have much to offer.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.844
How does a hundred bucks sound?

06:51.044 --> 06:52.479
Oh, I'll pay.

07:00.554 --> 07:01.955
So this was my case...

07:02.155 --> 07:04.158
...protecting the babe from her family.

07:04.358 --> 07:06.426
They were an ugly bunch,
but the old man, the colonel...

07:06.627 --> 07:08.262
...seemed lik e a decent guy.

07:08.462 --> 07:10.130
I think he felt a bond between us.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.536
I guess I should pay attention
to what he's saying.

07:16.303 --> 07:18.372
- What?
- Your foot is on my cat.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.308
Sorry.

07:21.675 --> 07:22.643
I'll be right back.

07:22.843 --> 07:25.012
I'm just going to get my coat
out of the car.

07:25.212 --> 07:28.048
Uncle keeps it just freezing in here.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.817
As I watched her leave,
I suddenly realized...

07:31.018 --> 07:33.153
...who really did put the "bomp"
in the "bomp sh-bomp."

07:41.695 --> 07:43.831
I think I said that out loud.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.267
Oh, well.

07:47.768 --> 07:50.604
I look ed over the family.
You could tell they hate the old guy.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.239
Sure, he was paying the bills...

07:52.439 --> 07:53.974
...but from the look
of Vanessa's shoes...

07:54.174 --> 07:57.377
...he was as tight as the skin
on Joan Rivers' face.

07:58.378 --> 08:02.416
But if they feared or hated me,
they sure hid it well.

08:11.859 --> 08:14.995
All right, you fruits and vegetables...

08:15.195 --> 08:19.132
...it's time now to see
which one of you pond scum...

08:19.333 --> 08:22.102
...will get the prize of
the Van Pelt family.

08:24.438 --> 08:25.439
Oh, uncle...

08:26.073 --> 08:27.574
...we don't care about the jewel.

08:27.774 --> 08:29.543
We just want you to live forever.

08:30.444 --> 08:33.614
Nice set of lips
to reach my heinie from there.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.784
That's a good one,
Colonel Van Sanders.

08:38.986 --> 08:41.388
- Who are you?
- Your worst nightmare...

08:41.587 --> 08:43.857
...a shoe man with a badge.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.025
No.

08:45.225 --> 08:48.262
My worst nightmare
is a hooker with cold hands.

08:49.663 --> 08:53.200
Well, I won't keep you ferrets
waiting any longer.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.269
The new owner...

08:55.469 --> 08:57.738
...of the Pharaoh's Eye...

08:57.938 --> 08:59.573
...shall be...

09:00.641 --> 09:04.011
- Who turned the lights out?
- Who's touching my breasts?

09:04.511 --> 09:06.880
Don't shoot me, I'm a shoe salesman.

09:07.247 --> 09:08.382
What's happened?

09:10.817 --> 09:14.254
Nobody move. I suspect everyone
and I suspect no one.

09:14.454 --> 09:15.856
What are you looking at?

09:18.292 --> 09:19.626
Oh, Mama.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.862
He killed our beloved uncle.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.598
And worse yet,
he's stolen the Pharaoh's Eye.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.334
Oh, Mama!

09:33.440 --> 09:34.741
So let me get this straight.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.543
Now, you went for a job as a janitor...

09:36.743 --> 09:39.546
...took a case as a private detective,
and now you're wanted for murder?

09:40.981 --> 09:42.316
Essentially.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.252
Well, then can I have
my allowance now?

09:45.752 --> 09:47.621
I'm wanted for murder, you dolts.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.089
The cops are gonna track me down...

09:49.289 --> 09:51.592
...and send me to the hoosegow.
I could use a little help.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.160
I have a plan, Daddy.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.699
It would be you, pumpkin.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.435
Now, Daddy,
the cops are probably watching...

10:01.635 --> 10:04.171
...the airports and the train stations
and the bus stations, right?

10:05.606 --> 10:07.207
Well, there is one way out.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.710
You could dig a hole to China.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.779
I saw Bugs Bunny do it once.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.083
Daffy never found him.

10:16.717 --> 10:20.587
Pumpkin, if Daddy gets the chair,
would you sit in his lap one last time?

10:24.691 --> 10:25.659
I'd be honoured.

10:28.929 --> 10:31.231
Look, Dad, it's obvious
you cannot hide out here.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.634
Why? You figure this is the first place
the cops'll come?

10:33.834 --> 10:36.770
No, I got a girl coming over
and quite frankly, you embarrass me.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.873
Al, Al. I just heard it on the radio.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.575
There's a $50,000 reward
on your head.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.777
We've gotta act fast.
Here, put on this hat.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.512
Put on this coat.

10:45.812 --> 10:46.813
Put on this cuff.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.883
I've got him! Come in and shoot!

10:50.317 --> 10:51.552
Shoot!

10:51.752 --> 10:54.688
Shoot him! Shoot him with your gun!

10:55.789 --> 10:57.124
So I ran.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.226
You would too
if you had a price on your head...

10:59.426 --> 11:01.762
...and a bad burrito in your belly.

11:02.329 --> 11:05.666
Amazing how many lock ed bathrooms
there are in Chicago at night.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.468
I was tired of running.

11:08.669 --> 11:11.104
I knew what I had to do.

11:18.312 --> 11:20.647
I think you have
a little plumbing problem in there.

11:21.515 --> 11:22.850
Anyhow...

11:23.050 --> 11:25.118
...I called you all together
here tonight...

11:25.319 --> 11:28.856
...because I knew that the one person
who had the diamond...

11:29.056 --> 11:30.424
...would not be here.

11:30.624 --> 11:31.925
But we're all here.

11:33.393 --> 11:34.995
Then forget I said that.

11:35.395 --> 11:38.365
What I meant to say
was that the killer...

11:38.565 --> 11:39.800
...is you.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.869
And just what do you base that on?

11:42.069 --> 11:43.804
Absolutely nothing.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.106
Which is why the culprit is you.

11:46.907 --> 11:50.043
Sorry, dick, it's well-known
that I'm deathly afraid of the dark.

11:50.244 --> 11:51.211
I was frozen in place.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.653
Who touched my breasts?

12:11.798 --> 12:13.267
It was me.
I had to check out your story.

12:16.537 --> 12:18.272
Which brings us to you.

12:18.805 --> 12:20.774
You plunged the knife
in your uncle's back...

12:20.974 --> 12:22.776
...then snatched the diamond
with your free hand.

12:22.976 --> 12:26.780
One gets to meet so few true fools.

12:31.285 --> 12:33.220
Which only leaves the killer...

12:33.420 --> 12:34.521
...you.

12:34.721 --> 12:36.323
Come on, Leonard, admit it.

12:36.523 --> 12:40.027
You were the criminal mastermind
that put this intricate plot together.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.395
Now what do you have to say?

12:42.262 --> 12:43.697
Daddy?

12:45.632 --> 12:47.134
Okay.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.570
Gee, then maybe it was me.

12:50.237 --> 12:51.972
I'm sorry, Al.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.474
I wanted to believe you.

12:55.676 --> 12:57.144
I'm calling the police.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.713
Freeze, baby.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.515
Where were you
when the lights went out?

13:02.583 --> 13:05.285
- I was outside in the rain.
- Were you?

13:05.519 --> 13:07.387
I prefer to think that you're the killer.

13:07.588 --> 13:09.423
- Oh, my God.
- That's ridiculous.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.792
- You have no proof.
- Don't I?

13:11.992 --> 13:13.327
Sit down.

13:20.234 --> 13:22.769
I say that you never did
go outside that night.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.805
You waited by the door
for the right moment...

13:25.339 --> 13:28.008
...hit the light switch, dumped
the vase on yourself to get wet...

13:28.208 --> 13:29.977
...and stabbed your uncle!

13:30.177 --> 13:31.845
You still haven't proved anything.

13:32.045 --> 13:35.249
Like the man in the stall said to
the man waiting, "Give me time, baby."

13:37.518 --> 13:39.453
When we met I couldn't
help but notice your shoes...

13:39.653 --> 13:41.955
...the same shoes you have on now.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.624
I used to sell shoes.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.359
For years.

13:45.759 --> 13:47.628
When I was a teenager,
but not when I'm grown up...

13:47.828 --> 13:49.963
...because a real man
wouldn't have a job like that.

13:50.931 --> 13:53.267
And I recognized these shoes...

13:53.467 --> 13:56.003
...the Malaysian A220 Stilettos.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.205
So cheap that the only ones
who wear them...

13:58.405 --> 14:01.275
...are beggars
and wives of shoe salesmen.

14:03.744 --> 14:06.446
You couldn't have gone outside
that night, or any other night...

14:06.647 --> 14:09.216
...because these shoes
are so cheaply constructed...

14:09.416 --> 14:12.386
...that they fall apart
on contact with water, like this:

14:28.402 --> 14:30.070
Well, baby...

14:30.270 --> 14:32.172
...what have you got to say?

14:32.673 --> 14:34.975
- I did it.
- Really? You're kidding.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.111
No. I hated him.

14:38.312 --> 14:39.880
And I hated all of you.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.382
He was going to give the diamond
to a museum.

14:46.753 --> 14:48.622
I would have got that for you.

14:52.359 --> 14:53.894
You were incredible.

14:54.094 --> 14:55.662
You broke me.

14:58.599 --> 14:59.900
Take her away, lieutenant.

15:02.169 --> 15:04.238
They'll probably put me away
for 20 years.

15:04.438 --> 15:05.639
Will you wait for me?

15:05.839 --> 15:07.474
What for? You'll be old.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.214
Good work, Mr. Bundy.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.416
I'm the curator
for the Museum of Natural History.

15:16.617 --> 15:19.987
As a reward, I'd like to present you
with this cheque for $50,000.

15:26.894 --> 15:28.662
He look ed at me strangely.

15:28.862 --> 15:31.832
Maybe it was because he wasn't
expecting me to tak e the cheque.

15:32.032 --> 15:35.836
Or maybe it was because he wasn't
expecting me to soil my underwear.

15:37.838 --> 15:39.973
I guess I'll never know.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.442
Fifty thousand dollars.

15:51.485 --> 15:53.320
Fifty thousand dollars.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.089
Fifty thousand dollars.
It's real, it's real.

16:02.029 --> 16:02.996
What?

16:03.363 --> 16:06.133
Al, you're making happy noises
in your sleep.

16:06.867 --> 16:08.268
Thought there might
be something wrong.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.538
Wait a...

16:11.738 --> 16:12.906
Wait a second.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.842
Where's the $50,000
that I brought home?

16:15.042 --> 16:17.277
You know, for solving the case
of the Pharaoh's Eye?

16:18.245 --> 16:19.313
Say what?

16:20.781 --> 16:23.250
It couldn't have been a dream.
It couldn't have been a dream.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.118
Honey, maybe I'd better
get you an aspirin.

16:25.319 --> 16:29.122
We can lay here and solve the case
of the wife who isn't getting any.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.292
But it can't be a dream.
It just can't.

16:32.926 --> 16:34.194
Kids!

16:35.529 --> 16:36.697
Bud, quick.

16:37.030 --> 16:38.999
Was I a detective wanted for murder
or was it a dream?

16:39.833 --> 16:41.635
Just might have been a dream, Dad.

16:42.803 --> 16:45.606
Do you call yourself "Street Rapper
Grandmaster B" or was that a dream?

16:46.006 --> 16:47.074
Oh, come on, Daddy.

16:47.274 --> 16:50.711
- Even Bud's not pathetic enough to...
- Wait a sec, Grandmaster B?

16:51.211 --> 16:52.846
The chicks would be all over me.

16:53.046 --> 16:54.748
I could wear my hat backwards.

16:54.948 --> 16:57.217
Oh, man, I'm gonna
go write my first rap right now.

16:57.417 --> 17:00.554
How about calling it
"Yo, I'm Really a Boy"?

17:04.223 --> 17:05.592
Peg, tell them it wasn't a dream.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.929
Honey, I'm gonna go get you
those aspirin.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.467
I think I'll make it a double.

17:16.837 --> 17:18.372
- Kids, that's enough. Hold it.
- I hate you.

17:18.571 --> 17:19.839
Kids!

17:20.674 --> 17:22.542
One quick question, that's all.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.211
Is your mother...?

17:24.411 --> 17:26.146
Repulsed by you?

17:26.980 --> 17:28.749
Disappointed financially
and sexually by you?

17:28.949 --> 17:31.585
No. I don't care about that, you dolts.

17:31.785 --> 17:32.786
Is she pregnant?

17:35.055 --> 17:36.557
Marcie?

17:37.758 --> 17:39.426
You think he's crazy?

17:39.626 --> 17:42.129
Well, he must be.
He didn't ask about you.

17:47.301 --> 17:49.369
Well, honey,
I just took the last of the aspirins.

17:49.570 --> 17:52.239
I figured you'd just get a headache
when you go to work.

17:54.708 --> 17:56.009
Now what's that for?

17:56.210 --> 17:58.545
Well, you dreamt you had $50,000...

17:58.745 --> 18:00.414
...and yet you still came home to me.

18:00.614 --> 18:04.084
That says a lot.
Says that you really do love me.

18:05.919 --> 18:08.522
What would I dream that for?

18:08.722 --> 18:10.257
Because you do.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.259
- I do not.
- Do too.

18:12.459 --> 18:13.694
No, it's just that...

18:13.894 --> 18:16.630
...it's too late now
for me to get anybody else.

18:17.998 --> 18:21.101
Well, now, see, that wasn't so hard.

18:23.103 --> 18:26.707
Peggy "wuvs"
her detective pooh bear.

18:30.210 --> 18:33.714
Gee, honey,
you know what I wanna do now?

18:34.815 --> 18:36.717
The same thing I wanna do?

18:39.353 --> 18:40.821
Well, let's get to it.

18:41.021 --> 18:42.923
You get the paper plates,
I'll order the pizza.

18:43.123 --> 18:44.925
Oh, baby!
