- You work for the German.
- I did a job for him once.

00:19.284 --> 00:22.318
- You transported a box from
the airport across the river

00:22.320 --> 00:25.054
into Manhattan.
- It cost me my mother.

00:25.056 --> 00:28.223
- Infect the infected.
- Find a weak link

00:28.225 --> 00:31.359

something up to exploit it.

00:31.361 --> 00:33.861
Something that the vampires
are vulnerable to, but that

- Thank you.

10:27.350 --> 10:30.117

10:38.526 --> 10:41.961

10:44.431 --> 10:46.999
- Questions about the menu?
(chuckling)

10:47.001 --> 10:50.735

this type of food before.

10:52.671 --> 10:54.238
You got something that kinda
tastes like spaghetti

10:54.240 --> 10:58.008
or something like that?

11:23.900 --> 11:25.866

- Was there something

11:25.868 --> 11:27.968
you wished to see me about,
Miss Velders?

11:27.970 --> 11:31.638
- I can't stop thinking about
that sociopath Eldritch Palmer.

11:33.240 --> 11:35.808
You knew him before this?

11:35.810 --> 11:39.378
- Our paths have crossed, yes.

11:39.380 --> 11:41.947
- Fet said that he saw a blonde

11:41.949 --> 11:45.216
up on the dais with him.
Not his usual body man,

11:45.218 --> 11:47.952
Reggie Fitzwilliam.

11:47.954 --> 11:51.322
- You're suggesting Mr.
Fitzwilliam had enough and quit?

11:51.324 --> 11:55.659
- I don't know, it could be a
dead end or a wild goose chase.

11:55.661 --> 11:59.329
Palmer ordered Fitzwilliam
to murder us, and he didn't--

11:59.331 --> 12:01.731
and now he's gone.

12:01.733 --> 12:03.833
Fitzwilliam has
no other legal address

12:03.835 --> 12:05.801
than the Stoneheart
corporate headquarters.

12:05.803 --> 12:08.203
But he does have a brother
named Curtis.

12:09.138 --> 12:12.339
A firefighter who lives
on Staten Island?

12:14.308 --> 12:17.576
You probably don't want to waste
your time with this.

12:17.578 --> 12:21.413
- I think you may be
onto something.

12:21.415 --> 12:25.149
- You do? I-I mean,
I could be wrong--

12:25.151 --> 12:27.351
- You're not. Let's go.

12:49.306 --> 12:51.307
- [Welcome to Staten Island.]

12:51.309 --> 12:54.109
[Please have your state-issued
identification ready.]

12:54.111 --> 12:56.311
[The current wait time
for entry screening]

12:56.313 --> 12:59.213
[is approximately three hours.]

13:06.654 --> 13:09.088
- It's bloody medieval.

13:15.494 --> 13:17.862
(knocking)

13:17.864 --> 13:22.433
- My office hours
are clearly posted.

13:22.435 --> 13:25.269
- Hello, Professor.

13:25.271 --> 13:28.905
- Eldritch! Why didn't you
tell me you were coming?

13:28.907 --> 13:31.240
- I flew over spontaneously.

13:31.242 --> 13:34.076
Got the news that you cabled
me-- it sounded too promising.

13:34.078 --> 13:38.079
- Yes, quite promising, indeed.
It could be a dangerous venture,

13:38.081 --> 13:40.681
however.
- Would you mind excusing us

13:40.683 --> 13:44.217
for a moment, Mr. Fitzwilliam?
- Not at all, sir.

13:48.154 --> 13:49.253
- Tell me.

13:49.255 --> 13:52.757
- After the<i> Lumen</i> was withdrawn
from auction in 1923,

13:52.759 --> 13:54.759
the trail ran cold.

13:54.761 --> 13:57.261
I suspect the Hungarian
moved north--

13:57.263 --> 14:00.497
to Belarus.

14:00.499 --> 14:04.967
I believe he survived
by assuming a false identity

14:04.969 --> 14:07.035
and passing himself off
as a Christian.

14:07.037 --> 14:09.637
- Yes.
- After the Warsaw uprising

14:09.639 --> 14:11.839
in 1944,
Hitler ordered

14:11.841 --> 14:16.009
the city be razed. This itemized
list from a supply train

14:16.011 --> 14:18.144
records a shipment
of religious iconography.

14:18.146 --> 14:21.780
I believe there is a strong
chance that the<i> Lumen--</i>

14:21.782 --> 14:24.382
mis-mislabeled or,
or misidentified altogether--

14:24.384 --> 14:25.883
was on that train.

14:25.885 --> 14:29.987
- Mm-hmm. Uh, bound for?
- This is the exciting part.

14:29.989 --> 14:33.824
Everything on that list goes
to one place--one obscure,

14:33.826 --> 14:36.393
unexamined place--
a nunnery in Berndorf,

14:36.395 --> 14:38.395
in the lower Austrian Alps.

14:38.397 --> 14:42.065
<i> This is the best lead</i>
<i> we have ever had.</i>

15:00.217 --> 15:03.452
Hello?!

15:05.688 --> 15:08.556
- This stench.

15:08.558 --> 15:12.159
- Ammonia. We're too late.

15:19.166 --> 15:21.100
As I feared.

15:21.102 --> 15:23.502
- No. No.

15:23.504 --> 15:26.905
(scratching sound)

15:52.464 --> 15:56.233
- Good Lord, boy! What
are you doing in there?

15:56.235 --> 16:00.437
Are you all right, hmm?
Boy, what's your name?

16:00.439 --> 16:02.238
- Rudyard Fonescu, sir.

16:02.240 --> 16:05.407
I heard you coming.
I thought they were back.

16:05.409 --> 16:08.743
- What happened to your ear?
- My father, sir.

16:08.745 --> 16:10.611
He held my head
against the stove

16:10.613 --> 16:15.215
to drive off the devil, he said.
- Boy, we're on urgent business.

16:15.217 --> 16:18.251
We're seeking a book.
<i> The Occido Lumen.</i>

16:18.253 --> 16:21.087
Do you know of it?

16:21.089 --> 16:24.790
- Mother Superior
said it was cursed.

16:24.792 --> 16:26.958
- This volume...

16:26.960 --> 16:29.994
did it have many strange
illustrations and symbols?

16:29.996 --> 16:32.096
- She said it was evil.

16:32.098 --> 16:36.399
She destroyed the book, but
her prophecy came true anyway.

16:36.401 --> 16:39.001
- Destroyed it?!
- She burned it, sir.

16:39.003 --> 16:41.670
She melted the silver binding
and the pages in between.

16:41.672 --> 16:45.773
- She destroyed the<i> Lumen? </i>
Where?

16:45.775 --> 16:50.310
Show us!
- (man screaming): Help! Help!

16:50.312 --> 16:53.413
- Wait here.

17:08.929 --> 17:11.297
- Mr. Eldritch Palmer.

17:11.299 --> 17:16.268
You are searching for the
secrets of eternity.

17:16.270 --> 17:20.805
But the answers you
have been looking for

17:20.807 --> 17:24.041
are not here.

17:24.043 --> 17:27.777
Would you like to know more?
- What do you know?

17:27.779 --> 17:31.747
- Everything.

17:50.899 --> 17:54.434
- Rudyard, come out!

18:08.481 --> 18:11.615
You don't want to hide
down here, boy!

18:13.718 --> 18:16.753
It isn't safe!

18:19.990 --> 18:22.992
(growling)

18:26.062 --> 18:29.230
Rudyard! They're here!

18:29.232 --> 18:33.233
Go to the light! They cannot
follow you into it!

18:33.235 --> 18:36.902
- Help!
- Where are you?

18:36.904 --> 18:40.472
(growling)

18:49.881 --> 18:53.083
(growling)

18:56.253 --> 18:59.288
Rudyard, run!
Get out of here!

19:05.761 --> 19:09.497
(screaming)

19:24.813 --> 19:27.114
Rudyard!

19:33.153 --> 19:35.220
Are you all right?

19:35.222 --> 19:38.890
- I want to return
to New York immediately.

19:38.892 --> 19:41.058
The<i> Lumen</i> has obviously
been destroyed

19:41.060 --> 19:43.393
and my quest
is at an end.

19:43.395 --> 19:46.295
And there's no use throwing
good money after bad.

19:48.298 --> 19:51.333
- But I've shown you proof
that these creatures exist!

19:51.335 --> 19:53.802
You can't turn
your back on that!

19:53.804 --> 19:57.738
Help me rid the evil
from this world.

19:59.474 --> 20:03.009
- There will always be evil
in this world, Professor.

20:03.011 --> 20:07.213
Now get me out of
this cursed place.

20:15.755 --> 20:17.822
(siren wailing in distance)

20:24.795 --> 20:29.365
(coughing)

20:41.544 --> 20:44.512
(flies buzzing)

20:57.525 --> 21:00.193
- Mama?

21:00.195 --> 21:02.228
Mama, don't make me do it.

21:02.230 --> 21:04.330
I can't do it. Don't
make me do it, please.

21:04.332 --> 21:08.032
Please, I can't do it, Mama.
Please,<i> por favor, no me lo--</i>

21:08.034 --> 21:10.334
(growling)

21:10.336 --> 21:12.202
NO!

21:12.204 --> 21:14.837
I won't do it! NO!

21:14.839 --> 21:18.740
NO! NO! I won't do it!

21:20.676 --> 21:24.344
I won't do it...
Mama...

21:24.346 --> 21:26.212
Mama.

21:26.214 --> 21:28.847
Come on, look at me.

21:28.849 --> 21:31.516
- You failed.

21:31.518 --> 21:34.585
- What?!

21:34.587 --> 21:37.087
- Augustin Elizalde.

21:37.089 --> 21:39.189
You failed.

21:39.191 --> 21:42.759
- I know who you are.

21:42.761 --> 21:45.394
- The ancients are the past.

21:45.396 --> 21:48.629
I am the future.
- Guess what.

21:50.365 --> 21:52.999
I'm not fighting
for the Ancients.

21:53.001 --> 21:56.002
I'm not fighting for
nobody but myself.

21:56.004 --> 21:59.872
- Cowardice. Ignorance.

21:59.874 --> 22:03.175
I sensed both

22:03.177 --> 22:06.678
as you ferried my coffin

22:06.680 --> 22:09.847
across the bridge
into this city.

22:13.284 --> 22:16.052
- If that's the case,

22:16.054 --> 22:18.387
then what am I to you?

22:18.389 --> 22:21.489
Huh? What do you want from me?

22:23.225 --> 22:25.759
- Your mother's disappointment

22:25.761 --> 22:28.094
is still here.

22:28.096 --> 22:30.896
The torment you put her through

22:30.898 --> 22:33.632
in life.

22:33.634 --> 22:36.301
It lives along

22:36.303 --> 22:39.904
with her dumb animal love

22:39.906 --> 22:43.340
for her criminal son.

22:47.311 --> 22:50.713
- Taking someone's soul
is not enough for you?

22:53.583 --> 22:57.085
You gotta put on their skin and
dance around in their body?

22:57.087 --> 23:00.988
- Of course you fight
for yourself.

23:00.990 --> 23:05.225
You always fight
for only yourself.

23:41.294 --> 23:44.195
- Fet need food.

23:44.197 --> 23:47.598
- I'm going to take
a nice, hot shower.

23:49.367 --> 23:52.802
You need to sleep.
- Can't. Too wired.

23:52.804 --> 23:56.538
- There is nothing else you can
do until the sun goes down.

23:59.141 --> 24:02.643
All right, you want to do
something, do it with your son.

24:02.645 --> 24:05.846
Get him out of here.
It will do you both good.

24:23.163 --> 24:24.429
- Whatcha doing?

24:29.233 --> 24:33.503
- Where were you
all night?

24:33.505 --> 24:36.639
- I was out babysitting
a vampire.

24:38.575 --> 24:40.475
Ah!

24:42.244 --> 24:44.011
That's the Jeter
foul ball.

24:44.013 --> 24:47.080
- The one you spilled a soda
on me trying to catch?

24:47.082 --> 24:49.248
- When I used the soda

24:49.250 --> 24:52.251
to deflect the ball so you could
get it from under the seat.

24:52.253 --> 24:54.753
You're welcome
very much.

24:56.522 --> 24:59.123
So, everything in your room,

24:59.125 --> 25:01.258
and this is what
you choose to bring.

25:01.260 --> 25:04.527
- Highest resale potential.

25:05.862 --> 25:07.829
- Mm-hmm.

25:09.531 --> 25:12.833
You know, the sun's out.
- And?

25:12.835 --> 25:16.102
- And...

25:16.104 --> 25:18.671
Let's do something fun.

25:24.877 --> 25:27.879
(TV news playing)

25:27.881 --> 25:30.214
(humming)

25:30.216 --> 25:33.050
- It's almost boom-boom time.

25:33.052 --> 25:35.552
<i> - So if you hear voices,</i>

25:35.554 --> 25:37.387
<i> these are</i>
<i> uninfected peacekeepers</i>

25:37.389 --> 25:39.455
<i> who are there</i>
<i> to keep you secure.</i>

25:39.457 --> 25:41.457
<i> We are going to give you back</i>
<i> your streets,</i>

25:41.459 --> 25:42.891
<i> your shops, your restaurants,</i>
<i> all of it,</i>

25:42.893 --> 25:44.626
<i> but I'm not going</i>
<i> to lie to you--</i>

25:44.628 --> 25:45.893
<i> it's going to take sacrifice.</i>

25:45.895 --> 25:47.961
- Hey, Nora! Hey,
come check this out.

25:47.963 --> 25:51.130
<i> - ...curfew which begins</i>
<i> tonight. Nobody will be--</i>

25:51.132 --> 25:53.899
- Guess what neighborhood
she's tackling next.

25:53.901 --> 25:55.901
<i> - My peacekeepers will be</i>
<i> going door to door</i>

25:55.903 --> 25:58.236
<i> to make sure that</i>
<i> everyone is safe.</i>

25:58.238 --> 26:00.471
<i> Please let them do their jobs.</i>

26:00.473 --> 26:03.140
<i> The quicker we can clear</i>
<i> these infected areas,</i>

26:03.142 --> 26:04.541
<i> the quicker that things can go</i>

26:04.543 --> 26:06.309
<i> back to normal</i>
<i> here in Red Hook.</i>

26:06.311 --> 26:08.377
- Yeah, smart.

26:08.379 --> 26:11.546
Red Hook's surrounded by water
on three sides. It's manageable.

26:11.548 --> 26:14.749
She picked a winner.

26:14.751 --> 26:17.218
- Other than imposing
martial law

26:17.220 --> 26:19.520
and suspending
constitutional rights.

26:19.522 --> 26:22.189
You don't see
the danger in that?

26:22.191 --> 26:24.257
- More dangerous than vampires?

26:24.259 --> 26:25.658
<i> - The more cooperation</i>
<i> that we get</i>

26:25.660 --> 26:26.992
<i> from our friends</i>
<i> here in Red Hook,</i>

26:26.994 --> 26:28.927
<i> the more effectively we</i>
<i> can do our work</i>

26:28.929 --> 26:31.262
<i> and restore order</i>
<i> to the neighborhood.</i>

26:36.868 --> 26:39.569
- You're sure this is okay?
- Hey, remember every other time

26:39.571 --> 26:41.571
we came in here,
a half-hour wait?

26:41.573 --> 26:43.873
We always wondered what it would
be like to have this place

26:43.875 --> 26:47.443
to ourselves. Your swing's
probably a little rusty.

26:47.445 --> 26:49.445
You haven't played
since Fall ball, right?

26:49.447 --> 26:51.914
- I didn't play
Fall ball this year.

26:51.916 --> 26:54.583
- That's right.

26:54.585 --> 26:57.719
Uh, medium speed?
- I don't know.

26:57.721 --> 27:00.922
- Slow-pitch softball?
- Dad.

27:00.924 --> 27:04.725
- Teasing! Medium speed it is!

27:04.727 --> 27:07.127
Right.

27:11.965 --> 27:14.266
Right. You ready?

27:14.268 --> 27:17.602
Set!

27:26.878 --> 27:28.878
Just... just work
on your timing there.

27:31.414 --> 27:33.815
Okay, now you're gonna want to
swing just a little bit sooner.

27:33.817 --> 27:35.950
Okay?

27:35.952 --> 27:39.152
Swing now!

27:41.255 --> 27:43.322
Step back in the box a bit.

27:50.396 --> 27:54.365
You think maybe you need
a lighter bat?

27:58.169 --> 28:01.370
<i> Let's see what you've got!</i>
<i> - Crush it, Mom!</i>

28:03.239 --> 28:05.506
Nice.
- You mean like that?

28:05.508 --> 28:07.641
- Yeah. All right,
here's the deal.

28:07.643 --> 28:09.576
You make two more like that,
I'm making dinner.

28:09.578 --> 28:12.178
- Do you want me
to miss on purpose?

28:28.528 --> 28:31.596
- Go again?

28:37.302 --> 28:39.736
Get out of here?

28:50.647 --> 28:53.615
<i> - I commend you gentlemen</i>
<i> for working together</i>

28:53.617 --> 28:57.885
<i> on an action plan in the face</i>
<i>of our current economic crisis.</i>

28:57.887 --> 29:01.188
This great city is the financial
center of the world,

29:01.190 --> 29:05.358
and this building, the Federal
Reserve, is its beating heart.

29:05.360 --> 29:08.027
The fact that we have assembled
the heads of every major bank

29:08.029 --> 29:11.697
and investment company,
reaching across party lines,

29:11.699 --> 29:15.467
sends a strong message
to markets around the globe.

29:15.469 --> 29:17.202
New York will reopen
for business

29:17.204 --> 29:18.937
first thing tomorrow morning.

29:22.174 --> 29:24.842
No, it's I who applaud you.

29:24.844 --> 29:28.679
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll
let you get to the work at hand.

29:28.681 --> 29:31.181
- Here come New York's
top financial players,

29:31.183 --> 29:34.317
who have reportedly come to
an agreement on an action plan

29:34.319 --> 29:36.919
that will resume market trading
tomorrow morning

29:36.921 --> 29:40.022
and restore liquidity to the
city's financial institutions

29:40.024 --> 29:42.924
in order to prevent
a run on banks.

29:42.926 --> 29:45.159
(screaming)
Now, it looks like

29:45.161 --> 29:47.494
some protesters
are here to engage--

29:47.496 --> 29:49.395
(gunshots)
Oh, my God!

29:49.397 --> 29:50.863
- Deb, get out of there now!

29:50.865 --> 29:54.899
(growling, screaming)

29:57.435 --> 30:01.438
(screaming)

30:05.041 --> 30:07.409
(growling)

30:07.411 --> 30:11.012
- Drive on. Slowly.

30:11.014 --> 30:13.413
(screaming)

30:15.616 --> 30:19.518
- Help me, please help me!

30:19.520 --> 30:21.786
(screaming)

30:41.406 --> 30:43.940
- Inside.

30:55.485 --> 30:59.888
- All right, we're alone.
What is it?

31:02.992 --> 31:06.494
- Remember me?
- What did you do, man?

31:06.496 --> 31:09.663
- Talk to them, Reg.
They know about you.

31:09.665 --> 31:11.164
You need to face this.

31:11.166 --> 31:13.833
- I've got nothing
to say to you.

31:13.835 --> 31:17.002
- You left Palmer.
You did the right thing.

31:17.004 --> 31:20.572
- Her I know.
Who are you?

31:20.574 --> 31:23.007
- My name is Abraham Setrakian.

31:23.009 --> 31:27.177
I believe you've heard of me.
- I couldn't get him

31:27.179 --> 31:29.512
to change his mind
about what he was doing,

31:29.514 --> 31:32.615
so I left.
- Resigning is not enough.

31:32.617 --> 31:35.985
You can help us save this city.
- I love the lesson in scruples

31:35.987 --> 31:39.254
from the hacker who took his
money with a wink and a smile.

31:39.256 --> 31:41.789
- We all make mistakes.

31:41.791 --> 31:43.991
- You hear about the attack
on the Federal Reserve?

31:43.993 --> 31:46.259
Vampires outside the financial
rescue meeting.

31:46.261 --> 31:48.694
Overnight markets
are in freefall now,

31:48.696 --> 31:51.163
and people are already
lining up outside of banks.

31:51.165 --> 31:53.365
There's going to be
a panic tomorrow, Reg.

31:53.367 --> 31:55.633
But who do you think got
out of that meeting

31:55.635 --> 31:57.501
in plenty of time to be safe?

31:57.503 --> 32:00.270
- Why would one of the world's
richest men want to bring down

32:00.272 --> 32:03.273
the financial markets?
What's Palmer's endgame?

32:03.275 --> 32:07.210
- At least answer
a simple question.

32:07.212 --> 32:09.612
I need to know about a book.
A holy book,

32:09.614 --> 32:13.148
a religious item.
<i> The Occido Lumen.</i>

32:13.150 --> 32:15.450
- Been a while since
I heard about the<i> Lumen.</i>

32:15.452 --> 32:18.052
- Palmer gave up on the search.

32:18.054 --> 32:19.853
Why?

32:19.855 --> 32:22.722
- He spent a lot of time
and a whole lot of money,

32:22.724 --> 32:25.157
only to discover
that it no longer exists.

32:25.159 --> 32:28.893
That it may never have existed
at all. - He's wrong.

32:31.463 --> 32:33.230
- You know so much.

32:33.232 --> 32:37.867
You and-and the professor
together... we could win this.

32:37.869 --> 32:40.736
- You may have resigned
from Stoneheart,

32:40.738 --> 32:45.340
but you haven't resigned
from Eldritch Palmer.

32:45.342 --> 32:48.509
You remind me very much
of your father.

32:48.511 --> 32:51.078
You can break
this chain

32:51.080 --> 32:54.181
of misguided loyalty
once and for all.

32:54.183 --> 32:57.184
I don't think you're
afraid of him.

32:57.186 --> 33:02.155
I think you think it's too late.
That evil has already won.

33:03.991 --> 33:06.558
I don't believe that
for a second.

33:08.694 --> 33:12.529
When you change your mind, we
can be reached at this address.

33:12.531 --> 33:16.232
- I'm not gonna change my mind.

33:18.168 --> 33:20.402
- Yes, you will.

33:20.404 --> 33:22.637
You already have.

33:42.724 --> 33:44.991
(sirens wailing, gun firing,
people shouting)

33:56.570 --> 33:59.271
- Hi.

34:01.274 --> 34:03.274
Thanks a lot.

34:06.077 --> 34:10.213
- I guess you liked the food.
- Yeah, it's pretty good.

34:11.949 --> 34:14.718
To tell you the truth, I didn't
have anywhere else to go.

34:14.720 --> 34:19.388
- We're always open. My parents
don't know any other way.

34:20.556 --> 34:25.559
So, if you need me to order
for you, just let me know.

34:25.561 --> 34:27.761
- Okay.

34:28.829 --> 34:31.764
- Raya?

34:37.670 --> 34:42.006
(quiet conversation)

34:44.909 --> 34:47.477
- Fine!

34:51.848 --> 34:56.517
My mother will be
serving you tonight.

34:56.519 --> 34:58.785
- You know what?

35:00.554 --> 35:05.424
No one's ever gonna love you
like your mama. Not ever.

35:05.426 --> 35:08.226
And when it's gone,

35:08.228 --> 35:10.661
you're gonna miss it
more than anything.

35:12.797 --> 35:15.965
- She was telling me she didn't
want me talking to someone

35:15.967 --> 35:20.669
like you.
(chuckling)

35:22.104 --> 35:26.674
- You and your mama
were fighting over me?

35:37.619 --> 35:40.787
- Cholo.
(tapping on table)

35:40.789 --> 35:44.257
You're out of her league.
You know it.

35:44.259 --> 35:46.892
Don't embarrass
yourself here.

35:46.894 --> 35:48.793
She doesn't need the hassle.

35:48.795 --> 35:53.130
Neither do I.
- Listen, dishwasher,

35:53.132 --> 35:55.132
not that it's any
of your damn business,

35:55.134 --> 35:56.833
but you got it all wrong.

35:56.835 --> 36:00.136
I didn't do anything. - We don't
need your element here.

36:00.138 --> 36:02.238
- My "element"!

36:02.240 --> 36:04.440
- Angel, no! - You
the same element as me,<i> vato.</i>

36:04.442 --> 36:08.643
- Look, I'm sorry. I was angry
at my mother, not you.

36:10.579 --> 36:13.480
- He's leaving.
- No, you don't have to leave.

36:13.482 --> 36:17.716
Angel's just--he's
overprotective. I'm sorry.

36:20.186 --> 36:23.421
- It's not worth it.

36:50.381 --> 36:52.382
(gasping)

36:52.384 --> 36:56.118
Angel.

36:56.120 --> 36:58.487
She called you Angel.

36:58.489 --> 37:01.857
And your physique.

37:01.859 --> 37:04.192
Angel de la Plata.

37:04.194 --> 37:06.794
The Silver Angel.

37:06.796 --> 37:10.364
You got the stance,

37:10.366 --> 37:14.067
the way you move.
And your knee.

37:14.069 --> 37:16.836
You hurt it in that movie,
ended your career.

37:16.838 --> 37:20.406
See, me, I like
the bad guy.

37:20.408 --> 37:24.009
The heavy. I think the same way.

37:24.011 --> 37:26.378
But you, man, you were the,

37:26.380 --> 37:28.513
you were the baddest good guy
there ever was.

37:28.515 --> 37:30.515
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

37:30.517 --> 37:32.383
- It's you! I know
it's you, man.

37:32.385 --> 37:36.086
You never took off your mask ...
but it's you.

37:36.088 --> 37:39.855
- You're wrong.
Now get out of here

37:39.857 --> 37:42.290
and don't come back!

38:02.944 --> 38:04.744
- We should've been here
an hour ago.

38:04.746 --> 38:07.880
- It's the curfew, Doc. They're
shutting the neighborhood tight.

38:07.882 --> 38:10.415
- Quiet!

38:14.452 --> 38:18.755
- Shit, they're gone.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

38:18.757 --> 38:21.524
What now?
- We have to find the vampires

38:21.526 --> 38:24.193
that were nesting here. We need
to know if the infection spread.

38:24.195 --> 38:26.528
- So, you're gonna go
knocking on doors

38:26.530 --> 38:28.930
looking for sick vampires? Hmm?

38:28.932 --> 38:30.798
After dark?

38:30.800 --> 38:33.867
If the professor suggested that,
you'd lock him away in here.

38:33.869 --> 38:35.902
- We don't have a choice.

38:35.904 --> 38:39.405
- Yeah. I do.

38:39.407 --> 38:43.041
- You're not still thinking
about blowing up

38:43.043 --> 38:45.109
the subway tunnel entrance?

38:45.111 --> 38:47.311
- Have your fun,
and I'll have mine.

38:47.313 --> 38:50.047
- We need the truck to get back.

38:50.049 --> 38:52.282
- All right, well,
with these patrols out,

38:52.284 --> 38:54.484
it's easier for me on foot.

38:54.486 --> 38:57.587
I know every shortcut in town.
- You're actually going through

38:57.589 --> 39:00.323
with this? You're gonna blow up
a New York City subway station?

39:00.325 --> 39:03.159
I thought you liked
architecture.

39:03.161 --> 39:05.895
- I do, Doc. It's just, uh,

39:05.897 --> 39:09.497
I like killing vampires more.

39:09.499 --> 39:12.466
Good luck.

39:18.572 --> 39:21.574
- Maybe we slowed down the
rate of infection too much.

39:21.576 --> 39:24.510
- What do you expect?
We've only done two trials.

39:24.512 --> 39:27.246
- It has to work.
- And if it doesn't?

39:27.248 --> 39:30.848
- Then we grab more
strigoi and try again.

39:30.850 --> 39:32.916
(snarling)

39:46.429 --> 39:50.431
He made it this far,
and now he's dying.

39:51.800 --> 39:55.536
(camera clicking)

40:03.644 --> 40:07.380
- For God's sake, release it.

40:16.690 --> 40:20.726
- This thing works. And it's
spreading. I know it.

40:20.728 --> 40:24.729
- Where are they?

40:24.731 --> 40:27.465
(screeching sound)

40:45.016 --> 40:47.750
- He's infected.

40:50.553 --> 40:52.820
Nora, switch to UV light,
then I'll get some more shots,

40:52.822 --> 40:56.589
then we'll get out of here.
(screaming)

40:56.591 --> 40:59.491
(growling)

41:03.195 --> 41:05.963
- Look out!

41:10.668 --> 41:13.569
- The Master's forcing them
to commit suicide.

41:13.571 --> 41:16.071
- Rather than spread
the fatal disease.

41:19.908 --> 41:23.310
(laughing)

41:26.614 --> 41:28.848
- It works.

41:33.219 --> 41:34.752
- [Train services
have now stopped]

41:34.754 --> 41:36.854
[according
to curfew timetables.]

41:36.856 --> 41:40.591
[Please vacate the stations
at your nearest exit.]

41:44.228 --> 41:48.464
- Wile E. Coyote,
eat your heart out.

41:54.269 --> 41:57.704
Meep-meep.

42:05.812 --> 42:08.480
- You sure? I didn't,
I didn't see anything.

42:08.482 --> 42:12.149
- I'm telling you, I saw some
guy come in here. I'm positive.

42:12.151 --> 42:14.384
- Keep your eyes open.

42:16.320 --> 42:19.121
- Hey, you guys!

42:19.123 --> 42:22.657
How you doing tonight?

42:22.659 --> 42:23.824
- Don't you know
there's a curfew?

42:23.826 --> 42:26.660
- Eh, lost track of time,
you know?

42:26.662 --> 42:30.063
- What's in the box?
- What, here?

42:30.065 --> 42:32.298
Just some dirty laundry.

42:32.300 --> 42:35.467
Hey, you guys like movies?

42:35.469 --> 42:37.135
- You're gonna spend
the night in jail, pal.

42:37.137 --> 42:40.638
- You know what I hate? I hate
when the, when the good guy

42:40.640 --> 42:42.973
is walking away,
and then a huge explosion

42:42.975 --> 42:45.675
goes off behind him,
and he never looks back!

42:45.677 --> 42:48.477
You know, that's
not real life!

42:48.479 --> 42:51.279
I mean, me, I'd stop,

42:51.281 --> 42:54.881
I'd want to admire my handiwork,
you know?

42:55.816 --> 42:57.783
Whoo!

42:57.785 --> 43:00.252
They never cover their ears,
either, right?

43:00.254 --> 43:03.154
- Put your hands on top
of your head now.

43:03.156 --> 43:05.489
- I just helped you, okay?

43:05.491 --> 43:08.525
I just cut off the main
vampire route into Red Hook.

43:08.527 --> 43:10.860
- Hands on your head, now!

43:10.862 --> 43:12.995
- Come on,
you heard him.

43:12.997 --> 43:16.164
- It's okay. All right?
I'm just on the job.

43:30.278 --> 43:33.313
- Get up! Get up!

43:33.315 --> 43:35.548
Get up!

43:43.523 --> 43:45.891
- Now it's time
for mass dispersal.

43:45.893 --> 43:47.726
- You're getting way
ahead of yourself.

43:47.728 --> 43:49.627
There are too many hurdles--
- Oh, no,

43:49.629 --> 43:51.795
we skip all those steps and
we go straight to Washington DC

43:51.797 --> 43:54.297
tomorrow morning.
- I agree that it's all

43:54.299 --> 43:56.465
very promising, but...

43:56.467 --> 43:59.402
Washington DC?
- Rob.

43:59.404 --> 44:01.237
Rob Bradley.

44:01.239 --> 44:05.741
- Oh, God. That guy? - Okay,
fine, you don't like him,

44:05.743 --> 44:08.110
but he knows everybody.
He's true blue,

44:08.112 --> 44:11.079
we go way back. He can get us in
front of all the right people.

44:11.081 --> 44:13.915
Both on the manufacturing side
and the military.

44:13.917 --> 44:15.650
- The military?
- It's a weapon, right?

44:15.652 --> 44:19.420
We're in a war?
The Master knows it works.

44:19.422 --> 44:22.022
Those suicides
confirmed it.

44:22.024 --> 44:26.325
He knows we're on it. We gotta
move as fast as possible.

44:26.327 --> 44:28.126
- This is too fast.

44:28.128 --> 44:31.696
- Goddamn it, Nora, we have
a solution. We've found a way

44:31.698 --> 44:34.498
to kill these things and end
this plague. Now we just have

44:34.500 --> 44:37.200
to find a way
to implement it.

44:39.603 --> 44:42.838
(industrial rock music
from headphones)

45:06.728 --> 45:09.362
(turning music off)

45:40.560 --> 45:43.461
(growling and sniffing)

46:27.238 --> 46:30.807
- Zack is near.

46:56.800 --> 47:01.136
