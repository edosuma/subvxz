00:01.234 --> 00:02.101
(Charles)
Jake, you gotta see this.

00:02.169 --> 00:03.302
There's something going on here.

00:03.370 --> 00:07.306
Something a little...
hairy.

00:07.374 --> 00:08.641
Nope.

00:08.709 --> 00:09.509
Don't see anything
out of the ordinary.

00:09.576 --> 00:10.676
Really?

00:10.744 --> 00:11.777
Well, maybe I should...

00:11.845 --> 00:13.980
frame the question
differently.

00:14.047 --> 00:16.916
Terry, do you notice anything?

00:16.984 --> 00:18.951
Amy?

00:19.019 --> 00:19.952
New shirt?

00:20.020 --> 00:21.487
Oh, come on, guys.

00:21.555 --> 00:22.488
I grew a goatee,

00:22.556 --> 00:23.489
and it looks amazing,

00:23.557 --> 00:24.624
and I know you can see it.

00:24.691 --> 00:25.525
Of course we can see it,
Charles.

00:25.592 --> 00:26.926
It's horrible.

00:26.994 --> 00:28.494
It looks like you unclogged
a shower drain

00:28.562 --> 00:29.729
with your mouth.

00:29.796 --> 00:30.863
Yeah, you look exactly
like the guy

00:30.931 --> 00:33.332
in the "Don't Talk to Strangers"
poster.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.767
No, I don't.

00:34.835 --> 00:35.701
Are you talking
about your new goatee?

00:35.769 --> 00:37.036
Mm-hmm.

00:37.104 --> 00:38.304
I think it's a good choice
for your face.

00:38.372 --> 00:39.105
Come over here,
so I can take a better look.

00:39.172 --> 00:40.339
Thank you, Captain.

00:40.407 --> 00:41.908
I knew you'd appreciate Bianca.

00:41.975 --> 00:43.342
That's right;
I call her Bianca

00:43.410 --> 00:44.510
because she's dark and thick

00:44.578 --> 00:46.913
like my first cousin Bianca.

00:46.980 --> 00:49.482
Jeffords, Peralta,
now.

00:49.550 --> 00:50.383
Wh--
[shouts]

00:50.450 --> 00:51.684
Say good-bye to Bianca, Boyle.

00:51.752 --> 00:52.685
[screams]

00:52.753 --> 00:54.086
No!

00:54.154 --> 00:57.189

01:15.042 --> 01:16.475
Hey, Charles.

01:16.543 --> 01:17.944
I want to ask you something,

01:18.011 --> 01:19.512
but you have to promise
not to get excited and weird.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.080
I can't promise anything
of the sort.

01:21.148 --> 01:22.615
It's about restaurants.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.083
[giggles]

01:24.151 --> 01:25.217
I'm so glad
I didn't make that promise.

01:25.285 --> 01:26.452
Oh, boy.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.687
All right, where do you take
your dad

01:27.754 --> 01:28.421
when you want to go
someplace special?

01:28.488 --> 01:29.422
Great question.

01:29.489 --> 01:30.456
We go to Csaba.

01:30.524 --> 01:31.457
It's a Hungarian restaurant

01:31.525 --> 01:32.992
that serves "Tál ezer kolbász,"

01:33.060 --> 01:35.161
the platter
of a thousand sausages.

01:35.228 --> 01:36.228
Ugh.

01:36.296 --> 01:37.563
It's symbolic of our manhood.

01:37.631 --> 01:38.898
Okay, I should've saved
the "ugh" till then.

01:38.966 --> 01:40.666
Anyways, I'll try and get
a reservation.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.134
My dad's coming into town,

01:42.202 --> 01:43.469
and we're going out to dinner
tonight.

01:43.537 --> 01:44.704
Why are you going to dinner
with him?

01:44.771 --> 01:46.806
He hasn't visited you
in six years.

01:46.873 --> 01:48.341
Yeah, he's busy.
He's an airline pilot.

01:48.408 --> 01:49.408
Regional airline.

01:49.476 --> 01:50.676
He flies internationally.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.178
[scoffs]
Quebec to Albany.

01:52.245 --> 01:53.412
What is going on here?

01:53.480 --> 01:54.313
What's your problem
with my dad?

01:54.381 --> 01:55.381
I'm just being wary.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.782
He left you
when you were seven,

01:56.850 --> 01:58.184
and he's been letting us down
ever since.

01:58.251 --> 01:59.418
Us?

01:59.486 --> 02:00.786
I think of you
as a brother, Jake,

02:00.854 --> 02:03.089
so he didn't just abandon you;
he abandoned us.

02:03.156 --> 02:04.490
Look, I know he hasn't been
the best dad in the past,

02:04.558 --> 02:06.058
but he's changed.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.627
Check it out.
We've been texting.

02:07.694 --> 02:08.761
"New phone.
Who dis?"

02:08.829 --> 02:10.196
No, below that.
Oh.

02:10.263 --> 02:12.264
See, he's coming into town
just to see me.

02:12.332 --> 02:14.033
All right, we're gonna go out
to dinner tonight,

02:14.101 --> 02:15.067
then maybe take a walk
through the park,

02:15.135 --> 02:16.402
possibly a carriage ride.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.671
If I get chilly,
he could loan me his coat.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.006
I'm describing a date.

02:20.073 --> 02:20.973
I don't know what fathers
and sons do,

02:21.041 --> 02:21.974
but I'm gonna find out!

02:24.711 --> 02:26.178
(Terry)
Joining us for lunch, sir?

02:26.246 --> 02:27.513
Oh, no, I've already consumed
the required calories

02:27.581 --> 02:28.481
for this day period.

02:28.548 --> 02:29.815
Yummy.

02:29.883 --> 02:32.084
But I do have
some fun lunch chitchat.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.285
When I was a detective,

02:33.353 --> 02:34.453
my old c.o., Jim Martins,

02:34.521 --> 02:35.988
used to keep us on our toes

02:36.056 --> 02:38.290
by have us solve
brain teasers.

02:38.358 --> 02:40.826
I thought maybe you'd like
to try one.

02:40.894 --> 02:41.727
Don't just tease my brain,
Captain.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.262
Really go to town on it.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.164
Yeah, bring it on, sir.

02:45.232 --> 02:46.565
I love puzzles.

02:46.633 --> 02:48.067
They're like power squats
for your mind.

02:48.135 --> 02:49.368
Good.
Here's a problem.

02:49.436 --> 02:52.138
There are 12 men on an island.

02:52.205 --> 02:54.407
11 weigh exactly
the same amount,

02:54.474 --> 02:57.777
but one of them is
slightly lighter or heavier.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.345
You must figure out which.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.113
And what do these men look like
facially

03:01.181 --> 03:02.915
and with respect
to their bodies?

03:02.983 --> 03:03.883
It's unimportant.

03:03.950 --> 03:05.584
So like Tyrese.

03:05.652 --> 03:07.953
It's a land of Tyreses.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.221
Sure.

03:09.289 --> 03:11.457
The island has no scales,

03:11.525 --> 03:14.260
but there is a seesaw.

03:14.327 --> 03:16.395
The exciting catch:

03:16.463 --> 03:18.564
you can only use it
three times.

03:18.632 --> 03:19.565
That sounds super exciting.

03:19.633 --> 03:20.700
Is this thing mandatory?

03:20.767 --> 03:22.168
Oh, I hope so.
Please say yes.

03:22.235 --> 03:25.071
No, but there is a prize
for whoever solves it first.

03:25.138 --> 03:26.605
Two tickets to this Sunday's

03:26.673 --> 03:29.041
Beyoncé Knowles
rock music concert.

03:29.109 --> 03:30.443
I'm in.

03:30.510 --> 03:31.744
Marcus loves Beyoncé.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.345
Everyone loves Beyoncé.

03:33.413 --> 03:35.247
My girls were conceived
to <i> Bootylicious.</i>

03:35.315 --> 03:37.750
Don't tell my wife
I told you that.

03:37.818 --> 03:38.751
[cell phone chimes]

03:38.819 --> 03:40.319
Whoop.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.988
Guys, my dad just texted.
He's in the building.

03:43.056 --> 03:43.989
Scully, stop eating.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.224
Terry, start flexing.

03:45.292 --> 03:46.792
Everybody be cool.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.627
Paging Detective Jake Peralta.

03:48.695 --> 03:49.662
Ah, Dad!

03:49.730 --> 03:51.063
How are you, son?

03:51.131 --> 03:52.131
Good to see you.

03:52.199 --> 03:53.265
Hey.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.634
Everyone, this is my dad.

03:55.702 --> 03:57.737
Hey, introduce yourself
in your captain's voice.

03:57.804 --> 04:00.206
Folks, this is
your pilot speaking,

04:00.273 --> 04:01.774
Captain Roger Peralta.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.709
If you look to your left,
you'll see me,

04:03.777 --> 04:05.277
making your acquaintance.

04:05.345 --> 04:06.645
Love that.

04:06.713 --> 04:08.247
Hi, I'm Jake's best friend,
Charles.

04:08.315 --> 04:09.248
How are you?

04:09.316 --> 04:10.249
Pop quiz:

04:10.317 --> 04:11.350
what's Jake allergic to?

04:11.418 --> 04:12.485
Bees.
And wasps.

04:12.552 --> 04:14.186
Guy didn't even include wasps.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.221
Huh!

04:15.288 --> 04:17.022
Wasps.
Those aren't even real.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.156
Oh, hey, Captain Holt.

04:18.225 --> 04:20.159
Come meet my dad,
Captain Peralta.

04:20.226 --> 04:22.027
Hello, Captain.
Captain.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.232
This is super weird
for me.

04:26.299 --> 04:28.267
Captain.
Captain.

04:28.335 --> 04:29.435
Anyways, you guys,

04:29.503 --> 04:31.170
my dad is the best pilot.

04:31.238 --> 04:32.138
Oh, come on.

04:32.205 --> 04:33.472
Tell them about Oregon.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.541
Okay, this one time
I'm in Eugene,

04:35.609 --> 04:38.043
I'm hitching a ride in
the jump seat of a commuter jet.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.545
I'm sleeping off
a wicked hangover.

04:39.613 --> 04:40.846
Noice.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.214
All of a sudden,
there's a jolt and a boom.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.482
A bird.
It was a bird.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.017
Yeah, we sucked a bird
into our intake.

04:45.085 --> 04:46.886
Next thing I know, the cabin's
filling up with smoke,

04:46.953 --> 04:47.953
alarm's going off,

04:48.021 --> 04:50.523
engine flames out and dies.

04:50.590 --> 04:51.957
We are in a dead stall.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.326
I look over at the pilot,
Sam Power--

04:54.394 --> 04:55.261
(both)
Great name.

04:55.328 --> 04:56.729
He's white as a sheet.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.330
And he says to me--
I'll never forget what he said.

04:58.398 --> 05:02.201
He says,
"Bobby's got a big ol' butt."

05:02.269 --> 05:03.836
Turns out he's having a stroke.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.104
Bring the plane down
on a highway,

05:05.172 --> 05:07.006
right across from a rest area.

05:07.073 --> 05:08.774
Get on the PA,

05:08.842 --> 05:11.277
I say, "Folks,

05:11.344 --> 05:13.078
coffee's on me."

05:13.146 --> 05:14.647
What?
Wow.

05:14.714 --> 05:16.048
Are you kidding me?
[applause]

05:16.116 --> 05:17.683
Anyway, I'm not here
to talk about me.

05:17.751 --> 05:20.085
I'm here to spend some time
with my boy.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.353
Ah, Dad.

05:21.421 --> 05:22.788
It's good to see you.
You too.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.123
Oh, hey, let me give you
a tour of the precinct.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.391
Cool.

05:25.458 --> 05:26.992
Ooh, you can interrogate
one of my perps.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.928
No, he can't.
Don't do that, Jake!

05:34.067 --> 05:35.434
You might as well save yourself
some paper

05:35.502 --> 05:37.136
and give up now, Sarge.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.804
You know I'm going to solve
this first.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.239
You probably can't tell,

05:40.307 --> 05:43.142
but I'm flexing my brain
like crazy right now.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.377
(Gina)
Yeah, you're both
wasting your time.

05:45.445 --> 05:46.779
Beyoncé's my spiritual twin.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.480
Those tickets are my birthright.

05:48.548 --> 05:51.150
No offense, but this is gonna
come down to me and the sarge.

05:51.218 --> 05:52.751
Whoa, you think you two
are the only ones

05:52.819 --> 05:54.119
that can solve puzzles?

05:54.187 --> 05:56.422
Yeah, what about Rosa, Gina,
and me?

05:56.489 --> 05:57.990
Is this how you want to die,
Hitchcock?

05:58.058 --> 06:00.392
Look, it's just that the sarge
and I are really into puzzles.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.494
Remember when I took
that Sudoku cruise?

06:02.562 --> 06:03.996
I never even went on deck.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.865
100 bucks says Gina and I
can solve this thing

06:05.932 --> 06:08.100
before you two puzzle dorks.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.336
[scoffs]

06:10.403 --> 06:11.770
Deal.

06:11.838 --> 06:13.405
You're going down.

06:13.473 --> 06:17.142
You're really not a part
of this, Hitchcock.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.010
<i> (Jake)</i>
<i> [sighs]</i>

06:18.078 --> 06:19.378
Did they bring out more sausage

06:19.446 --> 06:20.813
while I was in the bathroom?

06:20.881 --> 06:22.448
No, that's still
the first mountain.

06:22.515 --> 06:23.949
Good Lord.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.885
Anyways, do you remember
what you always did

06:25.952 --> 06:27.453
when you'd take me to dinner
as a kid?

06:27.520 --> 06:28.921
Tell the waitress
it was your birthday,

06:28.989 --> 06:30.022
so we'd get a free dessert?

06:30.090 --> 06:31.023
I already did it.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.258
[scoffs]

06:32.325 --> 06:33.158
I just told them
it was your birthday.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.193
Come on.

06:34.261 --> 06:35.527
Looks like
we're going to get

06:35.595 --> 06:38.264
two free probably disgusting
sausage-filled desserts.

06:38.331 --> 06:39.398
This is pretty fun, right?

06:39.466 --> 06:40.966
I mean, we're actually bonding.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.935
Jake, there's something I want
to talk to you about.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.771
Last week I was flying
into Albany from Quebec,

06:45.839 --> 06:48.340
you know how I always
keep my snowboard with me

06:48.408 --> 06:49.675
in case I get a chance
to carve...

06:49.743 --> 06:51.310
So cool.

06:51.378 --> 06:53.445
Well, Canadian customs found
some prescription meds

06:53.513 --> 06:54.647
in my board bag.

06:54.714 --> 06:55.814
They're accusing me
of smuggling.

06:55.882 --> 06:57.116
What?

06:57.183 --> 06:58.017
Yeah, I have no idea
how they got in there.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.051
They're not mine.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.019
But it's bad.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.054
I could lose my pilot's license.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.789
But you're the best pilot
in the world,

07:03.857 --> 07:05.958
I'm guessing without knowing
anything about the field.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.092
I'm really in a bind here.

07:07.160 --> 07:10.095
Jake, I need your help.

07:10.163 --> 07:13.332
That's actually
the reason I'm here.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.534
Oh.

07:15.602 --> 07:16.669
That's the reason.

07:16.736 --> 07:19.471
Happy sausage birthday
to both of you.

07:19.539 --> 07:21.840
[all singing in Hungarian]

07:21.908 --> 07:22.775
¶ ¶

07:25.895 --> 07:27.329
All right, let's talk
about my dad's case.

07:27.397 --> 07:28.797
The case of why he came
to town?

07:28.865 --> 07:30.265
I solved it:

07:30.333 --> 07:32.001
because he wanted
to take advantage of his son.

07:32.068 --> 07:32.835
<i> (Jake)</i>
<i> Okay, fine.</i>

07:32.902 --> 07:34.303
First I was a little upset,

07:34.371 --> 07:36.005
but then I realized
this is great.

07:36.072 --> 07:37.406
You know, we'll get to spend
some time together,

07:37.474 --> 07:38.741
and he'll see
what a good cop I am.

07:38.808 --> 07:39.775
He should already think
you're great.

07:39.843 --> 07:41.010
Like with my dad,

07:41.077 --> 07:42.478
he doesn't need me to prove
to him

07:42.545 --> 07:44.279
that Jake Peralta is
the best cop in the precinct.

07:44.347 --> 07:45.547
He knows it!

07:45.615 --> 07:46.548
Tell us about the case.

07:46.616 --> 07:47.883
Here's what we know so far.

07:47.951 --> 07:50.019
One, Hungarian sausage
is an oily mess,

07:50.086 --> 07:51.987
and it causes
nonstop dumps.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.555
The incontinence
is a small price to pay

07:53.623 --> 07:54.590
for the deliciousness.

07:54.658 --> 07:55.824
It's disgusting,

07:55.892 --> 07:57.092
and it was
a terrible recommendation.

07:57.160 --> 07:58.861
Two, the Canadian cops
think that my dad

07:58.928 --> 08:00.596
used his security clearance
to smuggle in

08:00.664 --> 08:02.564
over a thousand pills
of Turgidol.

08:02.632 --> 08:04.333
Canadian erection medication.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.001
Very potent.

08:06.069 --> 08:07.436
What?
I don't need it.

08:09.072 --> 08:10.172
[whispers]
But I love it.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.573
Oh, boy.

08:11.641 --> 08:13.375
Three, the case against him
looks pretty solid.

08:13.443 --> 08:15.611
Four, he's never been
a good dad to Jake.

08:15.679 --> 08:17.413
Five,
he <i> has</i> been a good dad,

08:17.480 --> 08:19.782
especially from ages
zero through seven

08:19.849 --> 08:21.650
and yesterday through forever.

08:21.718 --> 08:25.054
Six, nonstop dumps.

08:25.121 --> 08:25.954
<i> (Holt)</i>
<i> Enough.</i>
<i> How did you read these files?</i>

08:26.022 --> 08:27.089
They're in French.

08:27.157 --> 08:28.824
Scully translated them
for me.

08:28.892 --> 08:30.492
When I was nine,
my parents took me to Paris,

08:30.560 --> 08:32.327
and they accidentally left me
at the Louvre.

08:32.395 --> 08:33.595
By the time they figured it out,

08:33.663 --> 08:35.030
they were already
back in Queens.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.099
Okay, no one cares
about your boring life, Scully.

08:37.167 --> 08:39.268
This is about my dad
and proving his innocence.

08:39.335 --> 08:40.936
Sir, I'd like to go to Canada
for a few days

08:41.004 --> 08:42.136
and help him out.

08:42.205 --> 08:44.039
Of course,
but take Boyle with you.

08:44.107 --> 08:45.574
<i> It'd be good to have</i>
<i> an objective set of eyes.</i>

08:45.642 --> 08:48.610
Fine, but under protest
because he's a jerk.

08:48.678 --> 08:50.079
Also, we'd like to take Scully
with us.

08:50.146 --> 08:51.346
Well, perfect.

08:51.414 --> 08:52.514
I do you a favor;
you do me one too.

08:52.582 --> 08:54.049
<i> Thank you.</i>

08:54.117 --> 08:56.351
All right, there is no way
we let Amy and the sarge

08:56.419 --> 08:57.753
beat us.

08:57.821 --> 08:59.888
We sit here
until we figure this thing out.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.423
Rosa, my mind is ready.

09:01.491 --> 09:02.891
Okay.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.426
"There's an island with 12 men."

09:04.494 --> 09:07.796
Oh, I'm so bored.
I cannot do it.

09:07.864 --> 09:09.298
I can do this.

09:09.365 --> 09:10.966
One guy's slightly heavier.

09:11.034 --> 09:13.502
There's a seesaw.

09:13.570 --> 09:15.304
I got it.

09:15.371 --> 09:16.939
You use the seesaw to press down
on their necks

09:17.006 --> 09:18.140
until fatty confesses.

09:18.208 --> 09:19.374
Incorrect.
Damn.

09:19.442 --> 09:21.343
And disturbing.

09:21.411 --> 09:22.244
<i> (Roger)</i>
<i> Hello,</i>
<i> ladies and gentlemen.</i>

09:22.312 --> 09:23.879
<i> This is your captain speaking.</i>

09:23.947 --> 09:25.414
That's my dad.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.616
The captain talking right now,
I came out of his body.

09:27.684 --> 09:28.951
No big deal.

09:29.018 --> 09:30.285
<i> We're headed</i>
<i> for an on-time arrival</i>

09:30.353 --> 09:31.620
<i> in Drummondville, Quebec.</i>

09:31.688 --> 09:33.288
<i> Folks, this is a special flight</i>
<i> for me,</i>

09:33.356 --> 09:37.025
<i> because sitting in seat 3B</i>
<i> is my son, Jake Peralta,</i>

09:37.093 --> 09:38.360
<i> one of New York's finest.</i>

09:38.428 --> 09:40.295
[applause]
Oh.

09:41.297 --> 09:43.599
Love you too.

09:43.666 --> 09:44.533
Got to admit,
it was pretty nice of him

09:44.601 --> 09:46.034
to bump us up to first class.

09:46.102 --> 09:48.871
Ugh, this plush fabric
is making my rump sweat.

09:48.938 --> 09:50.672
Maybe you're just
a little too uncultured

09:50.740 --> 09:54.209
to enjoy such a sophisticated
kind of an experience.

09:54.277 --> 09:55.611
Oh, brother.

09:55.678 --> 09:58.113
[English accent] What do you say
there, Scully, old boy?

09:58.181 --> 09:59.615
Look at this nut mix:

09:59.682 --> 10:01.750
it's half cashews!

10:01.818 --> 10:03.152
I hope we never land!

10:03.219 --> 10:04.186
So loud.

10:04.254 --> 10:05.187
Hey, guys.

10:05.255 --> 10:06.822
How you enjoying the flight?

10:06.890 --> 10:08.157
So how's the case going?

10:08.224 --> 10:09.558
Oh, good.

10:09.626 --> 10:10.759
We already have four suspects

10:10.827 --> 10:12.194
who work at the airport,

10:12.262 --> 10:13.328
and I want to talk
to your girlfriend, Denise,

10:13.396 --> 10:14.463
because she had access
to your bags.

10:14.531 --> 10:16.532
Not on the night in question.

10:16.599 --> 10:18.934
She's been spending some time
at her place.

10:19.002 --> 10:20.602
Relationships are complicated.

10:20.670 --> 10:23.138
You cheated on her a bunch,
and she found out.

10:23.206 --> 10:24.406
Okay, I deserve that.

10:24.474 --> 10:25.974
Charles, I have cheated
on women in the past

10:26.042 --> 10:28.110
and on this one too.

10:28.178 --> 10:29.745
You got a penchant for blondes.

10:29.813 --> 10:31.213
Hey, come on,
you can't blame a guy

10:31.281 --> 10:33.315
for occasionally dropping anchor
at the cold Commodore Club.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.350
[laughter]

10:35.418 --> 10:37.252
So seriously, Jake,
this is going to be okay?

10:37.320 --> 10:38.687
Oh, yeah.
You're going to be fine.

10:38.755 --> 10:40.222
Yeah.

10:40.290 --> 10:41.190
Oh, my God, Jake.

10:41.257 --> 10:42.624
Who's flying the plane?

10:42.692 --> 10:45.494
Co-pilot, Scully.
Co-pilot.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.129
Okay, look.

10:47.197 --> 10:48.897
Let's try a new approach.

10:48.965 --> 10:50.766
We weigh these three islanders

10:50.834 --> 10:53.068
against these three islanders.

10:53.136 --> 10:54.136
If they weigh the same,

10:54.204 --> 10:55.537
we eliminate them,

10:55.605 --> 10:56.572
and if they don't,

10:56.639 --> 10:58.707
we...

10:58.775 --> 11:00.042
Where'd they go?

11:00.109 --> 11:01.810
Terry's mouth is full
of donuts.

11:01.878 --> 11:03.145
You said
we could eliminate 'em!

11:03.213 --> 11:04.713
Only if they weigh the same.

11:04.781 --> 11:05.948
We've been here forever.

11:06.015 --> 11:07.216
I'm getting snacky.

11:07.283 --> 11:09.218
Fine.
Let's start over.

11:09.285 --> 11:12.855
Okay, we balance
three against three,

11:12.922 --> 11:14.590
and if they weigh the same,

11:14.657 --> 11:16.825
we just...

11:16.893 --> 11:18.427
What just happened?

11:18.494 --> 11:19.428
Come on, man.

11:19.495 --> 11:20.629
Stop eating the islanders.

11:20.697 --> 11:22.130
I'm saving them

11:22.198 --> 11:23.966
from this weight-obsessed
nightmare island.

11:24.033 --> 11:25.334
By murdering them?

11:25.401 --> 11:26.935
I warned you
against using donuts.

11:27.003 --> 11:29.004
They're my trigger food.

11:29.072 --> 11:30.305
Mmm.
Terry.

11:30.373 --> 11:31.406
These islanders
are delicious.

11:33.743 --> 11:36.545
Okay, so two of our suspects
are in the baggage area.

11:36.613 --> 11:37.913
Do you think you can
get us access?

11:37.981 --> 11:40.048
You're with a pilot.
I can get you in anywhere.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.050
Hey, you guys want
a 10% discount

11:42.118 --> 11:44.219
on duty-free maple syrup?

11:44.287 --> 11:45.554
Do I ever!

11:45.622 --> 11:47.022
(man with French accent)
Roger Peralta.

11:47.090 --> 11:48.924
Roger Peralta...
[speaking French]

11:48.992 --> 11:49.892
Hey! What?

11:49.959 --> 11:51.360
Scully, what's going on?

11:51.427 --> 11:52.594
[speaking French]

11:52.662 --> 11:53.896
<i> (Scully)</i>
<i> "Roger Peralta is under arrest</i>

11:53.963 --> 11:55.230
<i> for possession</i>
<i> of a controlled substance."</i>

11:55.298 --> 11:56.865
What?
[speaking French]

11:56.933 --> 11:58.767
<i> "They found pills</i>
<i> in his apartment."</i>

11:58.835 --> 12:00.235
<i> (Roger)</i>
<i> Jake, I don't know</i>
<i> what he's talking about.</i>

12:00.303 --> 12:02.237
I swear I don't know how
those pills got in my apartment.

12:02.305 --> 12:03.338
Wait.
Jake.

12:03.406 --> 12:04.339
<i> Scully,</i>
<i> tell them we're cops.</i>

12:04.407 --> 12:05.307
<i> Tell them!</i>

12:05.375 --> 12:07.409
[speaks French]

12:07.477 --> 12:09.044
Shoot.

12:09.112 --> 12:10.012
That means "turnip."

12:10.079 --> 12:11.313
I said we were turnips.

12:11.381 --> 12:12.214
I got it.
Don't worry.

12:12.282 --> 12:13.949
We are turnips!

12:14.017 --> 12:15.384
Nope, that was English.
Yeah.

12:18.037 --> 12:19.705
The cops said your dad's
being held without bail,

12:19.772 --> 12:21.106
they want us
on the next flight out,

12:21.174 --> 12:22.808
and that Bernard's
is the best poutine place

12:22.875 --> 12:23.809
in the airport.

12:23.876 --> 12:24.977
You want some?

12:25.044 --> 12:26.378
No, I don't want poutine
right now.

12:26.446 --> 12:27.312
Yes!

12:29.148 --> 12:31.550
Man, I can't believe they found
pills at my dad's place.

12:31.618 --> 12:32.618
That means
none of our suspects

12:32.685 --> 12:33.785
could've possibly done it.

12:33.853 --> 12:35.621
Oh, my God, Boyle.

12:35.688 --> 12:38.590
Is there a chance that my dad
is actually a drug smuggler?

12:38.658 --> 12:40.192
Well, let's look
at the facts.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.561
Drugs in his luggage,
drugs in his apartment.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.262
Terrible dad,
terrible husband,

12:44.330 --> 12:45.998
cheats on his girlfriend.

12:46.065 --> 12:47.566
I think he did it.

12:47.634 --> 12:48.800
You're right.

12:48.868 --> 12:49.835
He didn't do it.

12:49.902 --> 12:50.969
That's not what I said.

12:51.037 --> 12:52.504
No, you said
he cheats on his girlfriend.

12:52.572 --> 12:55.040
Presumably, he has
to do that with someone,

12:55.108 --> 12:56.475
and that someone
would have access

12:56.542 --> 12:57.909
to his apartment
and his bags.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.546
Dad dropped anchor
at the Commodore's Club.

13:01.614 --> 13:02.714
"Someone" is there.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.049
Even so,
how do we get in there?

13:04.117 --> 13:05.884
By wearing
Dad's pilot uniforms.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.252
No, Jake, I just don't think
he's innocent,

13:07.320 --> 13:08.320
and I just think--

13:08.388 --> 13:09.221
So you don't want to be
my co-pilot?

13:09.288 --> 13:11.156
I'm in!

13:48.461 --> 13:49.594
But now
we're the underdogs,

13:49.662 --> 13:51.363
and we're the ones who need
a handout,

13:51.431 --> 13:54.032
so just tell us
the answer.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.967
Or have you forgotten
where you come from?

13:56.035 --> 13:57.502
I'm not gonna help you.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.838
I told you
that was not gonna work.

13:59.906 --> 14:01.106
Stop the clock.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.476
We're here,
and we have the solution.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.745
First, you weigh
six versus six.

14:06.813 --> 14:08.480
Wrong.
That'll never work.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.949
You just wasted your time
and mine.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.084
Click!

14:12.151 --> 14:13.919
I just captured the exact moment

14:13.986 --> 14:15.854
when you realized
you had failed.

14:15.922 --> 14:17.055
<i> I guess we all got</i>

14:17.123 --> 14:18.323
something out of this.

14:18.391 --> 14:19.558
<i> (Holt)</i>
<i> So that's it?</i>

14:19.625 --> 14:20.625
<i> This problem is</i>
<i> beyond all of you?</i>

14:20.693 --> 14:21.626
No one solved it.

14:21.694 --> 14:22.861
Believe me.

14:22.929 --> 14:24.996
No one is more disappointed
in me than me.

14:25.064 --> 14:28.300
"Than I," Santiago.

14:28.367 --> 14:29.968
[whispering]
Click.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.341
Hi there.
Yeah, that's us.

14:36.409 --> 14:37.309
Home sweet home.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.343
Got dem wings.

14:38.411 --> 14:39.478
Yeah.

14:39.545 --> 14:40.545
Ooh. Okay.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.247
Boom, right there,
behind the bar.

14:42.315 --> 14:43.715
That's my dad's type.

14:43.783 --> 14:46.051
Oh, he likes 'em neat and clean,
real tidy.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.119
What?

14:47.186 --> 14:48.720
No, blondes.
He likes blondes.

14:48.788 --> 14:49.721
<i> All right,</i>
<i> here's the plan.</i>

14:49.789 --> 14:50.689
<i> We're gonna go sit down,</i>

14:50.757 --> 14:51.990
order a couple of drinks,

14:52.058 --> 14:53.592
grab her fingerprints
off the glass she serves us,

14:53.659 --> 14:55.427
and then measure her wrist
for handcuff size.

14:55.495 --> 14:56.328
Ready?
Yeah.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.029
Oh, crazy flight.

14:58.097 --> 14:59.264
(Charles)
Oh, those hydraulics were loud.

14:59.332 --> 15:00.832
Yeah.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.268
Ah, bonjour, bonjour.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.370
Two whiskeys, please,
Chantelle.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.038
Thanks.

15:07.106 --> 15:09.074
Say, I'm looking
for an old sky pal of mine.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.509
Do you know Roger Peralta?

15:10.576 --> 15:12.144
Yes.
Yes, I do.

15:12.211 --> 15:13.512
How do you guys
know Peralta?

15:13.579 --> 15:15.080
Oh, I used to fly with him
back in Oregon.

15:15.148 --> 15:16.414
My name's
Captain Spike Masters.

15:16.482 --> 15:18.016
This is my co-pilot
Wanda Cohen.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.284
<i> (Charles)</i>
<i> I drive the plane</i>
<i> when he sleeps.</i>

15:19.352 --> 15:21.253
I also take care
of hotel accommodations.

15:21.320 --> 15:22.687
Where'd you guys say
you flew in from?

15:22.755 --> 15:23.655
Akron.
Luxembourg.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.023
Connected in Akron.

15:25.091 --> 15:28.293
Took the old 78...9er
on the wind stream.

15:28.361 --> 15:29.828
You know, flight stuff.

15:29.896 --> 15:30.829
Anyhow...

15:30.897 --> 15:31.963
[sighs]

15:32.031 --> 15:33.498
Can we grab those two whiskeys,
please?

15:33.566 --> 15:34.599
I do not know
who you are,

15:34.667 --> 15:35.901
and I do not think
you are pilots.

15:35.968 --> 15:37.269
<i> Your suit</i>
<i> doesn't even fit.</i>

15:37.336 --> 15:38.637
Ah.

15:38.704 --> 15:39.871
I had my stomach stapled.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.706
<i> Sécurité! Sécurité!</i>

15:41.774 --> 15:43.775
[speaking French]

15:43.843 --> 15:45.677
Ah!
Unhand us.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.078
This is outrageous.

15:47.146 --> 15:49.014
I demand to speak
with the commodore himself.

15:49.081 --> 15:51.216
There's no way
we'll get her fingerprints now.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.084
Oh, really?

15:53.152 --> 15:54.019
Voilà.

15:54.086 --> 15:55.287
French.

15:55.354 --> 15:56.955
She cleaned the bar
quite thoroughly,

15:57.023 --> 15:59.324
but this bottle is filthy
with her prints.

15:59.392 --> 16:00.325
Smurt.

16:00.393 --> 16:01.426
That's why you're the pilot,

16:01.494 --> 16:02.460
and I'm the co-pilot.

16:02.528 --> 16:04.229
Copy that, Wanda.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.897
Copy that.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.465
Wanda Cohen.

16:07.533 --> 16:09.634
<i> (Rosa)</i>
<i> Wait, Captain.</i>

16:09.702 --> 16:11.469
Gina and I figured out
your dumb brain teaser.

16:11.537 --> 16:12.737
I highly doubt that, sir.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.005
I'll judge for myself,
Santiago.

16:14.073 --> 16:15.140
<i> Okay, Diaz.</i>

16:15.208 --> 16:16.541
What's the solution?

16:16.609 --> 16:17.642
We have no idea.

16:17.710 --> 16:18.543
Ha!
Told ya.

16:18.611 --> 16:19.811
But neither do you, sir.

16:19.879 --> 16:20.779
What?

16:20.847 --> 16:21.847
Captain Holt,

16:21.914 --> 16:23.081
you don't know
what the solution is.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.282
Excuse me?

16:24.350 --> 16:25.650
Here's how we cracked it.

16:25.718 --> 16:28.353
I took the photo of you
demolishing Amy's spirit

16:28.421 --> 16:32.390
and made these clever T-shirts
that say, "#nerdfail."

16:32.458 --> 16:33.692
It's not that clever.

16:33.759 --> 16:35.026
It's hilarious.

16:35.094 --> 16:36.361
Look at this.

16:36.429 --> 16:39.631
Your expression
is the same as Amy's

16:39.699 --> 16:41.099
because you're both devastated

16:41.167 --> 16:42.500
that you just
let down your mentors.

16:42.568 --> 16:43.969
<i> (Gina)</i>
<i> I looked at your calendar.</i>

16:44.036 --> 16:46.304
You're supposed to have
breakfast with your old c.o.

16:46.372 --> 16:48.373
You wanted us to solve
the problem before you saw him.

16:48.441 --> 16:49.908
That's crazy.

16:49.976 --> 16:51.009
She's right.

16:51.077 --> 16:52.244
What?
No.

16:52.311 --> 16:55.046
He posed that problem to me
20 years ago.

16:55.114 --> 16:56.248
Every time I see him,
he asks,

16:56.315 --> 16:57.349
"Do you have the answer yet?"

16:57.416 --> 16:58.583
And I never have.

16:58.651 --> 17:01.219
Those islanders
and their pathetic seesaw

17:01.287 --> 17:02.554
haunt my dreams.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.455
They mock me in my sleep,

17:04.522 --> 17:08.727
riding up and down
on a teeter-totter of taunts.

17:08.794 --> 17:09.794
Cool.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.695
So who gets
the Beyoncé tickets?

17:13.766 --> 17:16.800

¶ O Canada ¶

17:16.868 --> 17:20.704
¶ You home of crappy cops ¶

17:20.772 --> 17:22.874
Guess who just freed his dad
from Canadian prison

17:22.942 --> 17:24.442
<i> and slammed</i>
<i> six free mimosas</i>

17:24.510 --> 17:25.911

17:27.747 --> 17:28.680
Spoiler alert,
it was Jake.

17:28.748 --> 17:29.748
It was me.

17:29.815 --> 17:31.082
<i> So turns out</i>

17:31.150 --> 17:32.250
my dad's sidepiece
framed him.

17:32.318 --> 17:33.518
She was hella pissed

17:33.586 --> 17:35.420
'cause she found out
about his real girlfriend

17:35.488 --> 17:36.588
and his other sidepiece.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.623
So yeah.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.592
Turns out my dad
is a great guy after all.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.227
And in celebration
of my freedom,

17:42.295 --> 17:43.929
I'm taking
everybody out tonight.

<i> Hey, Hank.</i>

17:56.142 --> 17:57.108
When you see
my dad walk in,

17:57.176 --> 17:58.376
can you dim the lights

17:58.444 --> 17:59.244
and play <i> </i>
<i> We Are the Champions?</i>

17:59.312 --> 18:00.512
No.

18:00.579 --> 18:01.680
I don't know
what your dad looks like,

18:01.747 --> 18:02.747
I don't have the song...
[phone chimes]

18:02.815 --> 18:04.049
And the lights
aren't on dimmers.

18:04.116 --> 18:05.383
Oh, no.
It's okay, Jake.

18:05.451 --> 18:07.285
You give me the signal,
I'll start unscrewing bulbs.

18:07.353 --> 18:09.521
No, my dad just texted.

18:09.588 --> 18:10.855
He's not coming.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.657
To Jake's dad!

18:12.725 --> 18:14.059
[all cheer]

18:15.561 --> 18:16.628
Yep.

18:18.514 --> 18:19.748
Sorry, Jake.

18:19.815 --> 18:20.715
I'm sure your dad has
a really good reason

18:20.783 --> 18:21.783
for not being here.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.451
No, don't do that,
all right?

18:23.519 --> 18:24.619
Don't let him off the hook.

18:24.687 --> 18:26.054
That's what I've done
my whole life.

18:26.122 --> 18:27.922
You know, when he missed
my 11th birthday,

18:27.990 --> 18:31.760
I blamed myself for being born
on a peak travel day.

18:31.827 --> 18:33.461
You were right about him,
Boyle.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.030
So what do we do now?

18:35.097 --> 18:36.464
Hug for ten minutes.

18:36.532 --> 18:37.666
No, give me a rain check
on the hug.

18:37.733 --> 18:39.434
There's something
I got to do.

18:39.502 --> 18:41.303
You can have my beer.
Cool.

[knocks on door]

18:43.806 --> 18:45.473

18:45.541 --> 18:47.175
I'm sorry I couldn't make it
to the party.

18:47.243 --> 18:50.345
I'm subbing for a buddy
who's got an early flight.

18:50.413 --> 18:51.613
I'm sure you're upset.

18:51.681 --> 18:53.315
No, actually,
I'm not upset at all.

18:53.382 --> 18:54.316
Yeah?

18:54.383 --> 18:55.350
Great.

18:55.418 --> 18:56.918
No, more relieved.

18:56.986 --> 18:59.154
You know,
you were always my hero,

18:59.221 --> 19:00.789
but I think I'm finally
starting to see you

19:00.856 --> 19:01.856
for who you really are:

19:01.924 --> 19:03.658
a regional airline pilot

19:03.726 --> 19:04.993
whose landings
are bumpy as hell

19:05.061 --> 19:06.361
and a pretty selfish guy

19:06.429 --> 19:08.296
who genuinely doesn't care
about being a dad.

19:08.364 --> 19:11.666
Jake, you don't understand.

19:11.734 --> 19:14.002
There was a downdraft
on the Drummondville runway.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.670
Oh, wow.

19:15.738 --> 19:16.705
It's not my fault.

19:16.772 --> 19:18.306
Yeah, clearly.

19:18.374 --> 19:21.710
Look, I've been making excuses
for you my whole life,

19:21.777 --> 19:23.845
but you're
a pretty crappy father,

19:23.913 --> 19:25.947
and until you're ready
to be a good one,

19:26.015 --> 19:28.249
don't call me.

19:28.317 --> 19:29.718
Also I'm taking
your captain hat

19:29.785 --> 19:32.687
because it's cool,
and I want it.

19:42.398 --> 19:43.531

you weren't smart.

19:45.334 --> 19:47.335
Oh, and I'm sorry
if we implied

you're both asexual nerds

Yes.

19:58.848 --> 19:59.981
It's the least I can do

20:00.049 --> 20:02.784
for teasing your brains
so mercilessly.

20:02.852 --> 20:04.719
So what are you gonna say
to your old c.o. tomorrow

20:04.787 --> 20:06.287

if you've solved the puzzle?

20:06.355 --> 20:07.288

so he can go
suck an egg.

It shows real heart.

20:21.871 --> 20:24.372

"suck an egg" idea.

20:24.440 --> 20:27.308
You get
the Beyoncé tickets.

Of course I do.

about you.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.197
Come here.
Ten-minute hug time.

20:49.265 --> 20:50.265
I'd rather not.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.534
Come on.
Okay.

20:52.601 --> 20:54.469
Boyle, release him.

20:54.537 --> 20:56.704
Fine, only because
you're ordering me to.

20:56.772 --> 20:58.106
There's nine minutes left
on that hug.

20:58.174 --> 20:59.407
Great.

20:59.475 --> 21:00.975
Heh.

21:01.043 --> 21:02.510
Nice job in Quebec.

21:02.578 --> 21:04.913
I bet the local cops weren't
happy you showed them up.

21:04.980 --> 21:06.381
Yeah, well,
maybe not at first.

21:06.449 --> 21:09.083
But by the end, they kept
calling me a real <i> bâtard,</i>

21:09.151 --> 21:10.718
which I can only assume
means "hero."

21:10.786 --> 21:12.053
It means "bastard,"

21:12.121 --> 21:13.688
but that's only
because they were jealous.

21:13.756 --> 21:14.856
You did good work.

21:14.924 --> 21:15.824
Here.

21:15.891 --> 21:17.325
Is this an allowance?

21:17.393 --> 21:18.660
Are you giving me
an allowance?

21:18.727 --> 21:20.428
No, I'm paying the bartender
for more drinks.

21:20.496 --> 21:21.496
Oh, right.

21:22.932 --> 21:23.765
I'm proud of you.

21:26.902 --> 21:28.336
(Charles)
Nine minutes start now!

21:30.606 --> 21:32.340
Not a doctor.
Shh!
