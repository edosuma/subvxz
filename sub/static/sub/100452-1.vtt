19:19.524 --> 19:20.668
It was the best
decision for your future.

19:20.692 --> 19:24.696
It wasn't your decision
to make. You know, I don't want

19:24.729 --> 19:28.433
that getting out. You
know how that shit spreads.

19:29.634 --> 19:30.769
Even Tory...

19:30.802 --> 19:32.937
Tory's a dumb cunt.
Don't worry about it.

19:34.005 --> 19:36.909
Nobody'll talk.
I made sure of it.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.774
Listen I know that...

20:10.808 --> 20:14.646
I don't wanna talk about
it. We were just joking around.

20:15.980 --> 20:18.550
Yeah. I would appreciate-

20:18.583 --> 20:23.255
Listen, what you did was
disgusting, and I wish I hadn't

20:23.288 --> 20:27.459
seen it. I'm not talking about
this again and I think it's best

20:27.492 --> 20:29.360
if you did the same.

20:33.598 --> 20:36.434
To all of you she may

20:36.467 --> 20:38.971
have been
just a guidance counselor,

20:39.671 --> 20:42.774
but to me a friend

20:43.441 --> 20:45.978
taken too soon.

20:47.378 --> 20:51.483
So, I think it
is fitting that we dedicate this

20:51.516 --> 20:55.620
final performance in her memory.

20:55.653 --> 20:57.956
The highest degree

20:57.989 --> 21:02.827
of proficiency,
skill and excellence.

21:02.860 --> 21:07.631
You know that's how the
dictionary describes perfection

21:07.665 --> 21:12.271
and I expect
nothing less of you.

21:12.704 --> 21:17.042
We are going
to hit all our queues,

21:17.075 --> 21:20.612
our lines and our marks.

21:21.112 --> 21:23.915
We are going to remain focused!

21:25.350 --> 21:28.887
No excuses.

21:41.933 --> 21:46.705
Welcome gentlemen. Ladies that
have their toes un-plagued by

21:46.738 --> 21:50.608
corn will have a bout with
you. Come, musicians play.

21:50.641 --> 21:54.780
A hall, a hall,
make room. Foot it girls.

21:56.881 --> 22:01.019
♪ RENAISSANCE INSTRUMENTALS ♪

22:28.446 --> 22:29.747
Hello?

22:33.451 --> 22:35.087
Hello?

22:58.943 --> 23:01.646
Is everything okay?

23:05.149 --> 23:06.684
Miles, is that you?

23:06.717 --> 23:08.762
Look, let me just finish
this smoke and I'll come back

23:08.786 --> 23:10.756
inside okay?

23:16.561 --> 23:18.963
I'm sure
you're just joking around but

23:18.996 --> 23:20.465
I'm really not
in the mood for games.

23:38.683 --> 23:40.152
Please, somebody help me!

23:40.685 --> 23:42.486
Somebody please! Please don't!

23:42.520 --> 23:43.555
Please don't, please!

23:45.089 --> 23:46.991
Please. Please stop,
please! No, no, no, no, no!

24:13.818 --> 24:16.521
Nice job, nice job. Good job.

24:16.554 --> 24:21.560
We are back in
10 minutes guys. 10 minutes.

24:22.226 --> 24:26.198
Taylor.
Would you join me over here?

24:26.731 --> 24:28.233
I really liked that first scene.

24:28.266 --> 24:31.770
What exactly are you doing?

24:32.169 --> 24:33.104
What do you mean?

24:33.137 --> 24:36.274
I've seen cripples
dance better than that.

24:36.307 --> 24:39.611
Did you even study my notes?

24:39.644 --> 24:41.813
Yes, I studied your notes.

24:41.846 --> 24:44.182
I, I hit all my
marks. I'm projecting.

24:44.215 --> 24:47.150
I had high expectations for you.

24:47.184 --> 24:50.789
Clearly my trust was misplaced.

24:52.056 --> 24:53.558
I'm sorry.

24:53.591 --> 24:56.828
I'm going to have to
call Juilliard tomorrow and

24:56.861 --> 25:00.198
cancel my recommendation.

25:00.231 --> 25:05.003
Afraid you'll just
have to try again next year.

25:05.036 --> 25:09.774
Why would you do that?
I have no idea where this is

25:09.807 --> 25:11.242
coming from.

25:11.275 --> 25:12.753
We're back in a few minutes.

25:12.777 --> 25:13.879
Okay.

25:14.345 --> 25:16.715
Finish the show.

25:17.214 --> 25:20.284
We'll discuss this later.

25:37.702 --> 25:40.572
Drew.
What are you doin' out here?

25:40.605 --> 25:42.774
Uh, it's not a problem.

25:44.141 --> 25:48.146
You alright?
You feeling better now?

25:52.750 --> 25:55.653
Look I'm sorry. I'll, I'll, I'll
clean that up after the show I...

25:55.686 --> 25:58.055
No, you know what?
Don't worry 'bout it. I'll,

25:58.089 --> 26:00.625
I'll, I'll get it,
I'll leave it for the birds.

26:03.160 --> 26:05.664
Thanks.

26:06.230 --> 26:09.000
Uh, you know,
I've been sneaking little peeks

26:09.033 --> 26:12.169
of the show.
You really are a star.

26:12.870 --> 26:17.242
Thanks Drew.
Means a lot. See ya after?

26:19.844 --> 26:22.314
Break a leg.

26:39.230 --> 26:41.766
Two more scenes
and I am almost done with this

26:41.799 --> 26:43.401
nightmare.

26:47.004 --> 26:50.375
Don't pay attention to him.
Juilliard doesn't deserve you.

26:50.408 --> 26:52.176
You're gonna
go to your second choice

26:52.209 --> 26:54.212
and then you're gonna
slay the theater scene there.

26:54.945 --> 26:58.750
Oh, you're being supportive
now? Guilty conscience?

27:01.152 --> 27:02.387
Hey, good job.

27:02.420 --> 27:06.324
Thanks. Yeah for whatever reason

27:06.357 --> 27:11.363
that fight scene just
wears me out.

27:12.897 --> 27:13.965
Out of shape huh?

27:13.998 --> 27:15.166
Hardly.

27:15.199 --> 27:18.002
Just gettin' started. You know
I was thinkin' I was thinkin'

27:18.035 --> 27:22.240
maybe, maybe
at the cast party we can...

27:25.309 --> 27:29.280
Yeah that's quite the fantasy
but I'm gonna pass. You know

27:29.313 --> 27:31.324
after tonight I don't even
wanna shake hands with you.

27:31.348 --> 27:33.851
Hey you know what Taylor?

27:33.884 --> 27:35.820
You don't
need to be a fuckin' bitch.

27:35.853 --> 27:36.921
Excuse me?

27:36.922 --> 27:37.989
Yeah, yeah you heard me.

27:38.289 --> 27:41.225
I heard what
Arthur said to you. Figured gee,

27:41.258 --> 27:44.896
let's be the nice
guy. But you know what?

27:44.929 --> 27:47.332
It's your loss.

27:57.942 --> 28:02.380
These violent
delights, have violent ends.

28:17.161 --> 28:19.263
What the fuck?

28:19.296 --> 28:22.934
Oh that was only a
kiss. The rest is yet to come.

28:28.472 --> 28:30.875
Can we give it up for Miles?

28:31.175 --> 28:33.911
Such a fantastic actor

28:33.944 --> 28:36.514
in every single
performance of this show.

28:36.547 --> 28:40.318
A true talent. Yeah!

28:44.221 --> 28:49.127
You guys did
Grace proud. Have fun tonight.

28:49.393 --> 28:51.863
Have a blast. And those

28:51.896 --> 28:53.798
of you who are not returning for

28:53.831 --> 28:56.967
another
show best of luck to you.

28:57.001 --> 28:59.470
The rest of you,
see you next semester.

28:59.503 --> 29:01.906
Now as you
all know per tradition,

29:01.939 --> 29:03.141
cast party at my house.

29:03.874 --> 29:04.742
Yeah boy.

29:04.775 --> 29:06.778
Now for those
freshman, it's just across

29:06.811 --> 29:08.879
the baseball field out back.

29:10.047 --> 29:12.817
Do you know why I snubbed you?

29:15.920 --> 29:19.324
It has nothing
to do with your acting.

29:19.857 --> 29:24.095
In fact I've always thought
you had enormous potential.

29:25.262 --> 29:26.230
Arthur I...

29:26.263 --> 29:29.466
I'm not finished. Do you

29:29.500 --> 29:34.238
wanna know why I'm a director?
It's because I can read people.

29:34.271 --> 29:37.341
It's what I do for a living.

29:38.242 --> 29:40.344
I don't know
what you're talking about.

29:40.377 --> 29:42.379
You can cut the act.

29:42.413 --> 29:45.516
I overheard
that little conversation between

29:45.549 --> 29:48.485
you and Emma in the bathroom.

29:50.421 --> 29:53.158
You have no idea what you heard.

29:53.924 --> 29:57.094
All these years
I have been grooming

29:57.127 --> 29:58.830
you Taylor.

30:00.364 --> 30:04.002
What do you hope to accomplish
with this distraction?

30:04.235 --> 30:06.471
What have you become?

30:22.319 --> 30:26.825
Fantastic,
magnificent, perfection.

30:27.224 --> 30:31.395
I'm glad you thought so. Aw,
you shouldn't have done that.

30:31.428 --> 30:33.531
I didn't. Someone sent them to

30:33.564 --> 30:38.002
the house. I can uh, put
them in a vase for you at home.

30:39.169 --> 30:41.606
What's wrong?
You look sad kiddo.

30:42.606 --> 30:45.109
I'm alright. Just exhausted.

30:45.142 --> 30:48.045
Hm. I know it isn't easy.

30:48.078 --> 30:51.983
Try and keep
everything in perspective.

30:52.016 --> 30:53.418
What do you mean?

30:54.118 --> 30:56.620
I know how hard school can be.

30:57.621 --> 31:01.459
When I was a freshman
I was pregnant with you.

31:03.494 --> 31:07.866
What I'm trying to
say is that this'll pass too.

31:09.333 --> 31:14.138
Thanks mom. I guess I'm pretty
lucky that you kept me huh?

31:16.974 --> 31:19.644
I'm sorry that
William couldn't make it.

31:19.677 --> 31:21.212
He's out.

31:21.245 --> 31:22.914
No it, it doesn't matter.

31:22.947 --> 31:26.050
It does matter.
It's important that he take an

31:26.083 --> 31:29.120
interest in my only
daughter's accomplishments.

31:30.688 --> 31:35.126
It's okay mom. You know,
like dad says what goes around

31:35.159 --> 31:37.194
comes around.

31:37.227 --> 31:40.431
That's my daughter.
You ready for the party?

31:40.464 --> 31:42.600
You deserve some fun.

31:42.633 --> 31:45.403
No, I'm not really
looking forward to it actually.

31:46.203 --> 31:49.374
That's the wrong answer. Hm.

31:53.210 --> 31:54.512
I fucking hate him.

31:54.545 --> 31:55.413
That's kinda harsh.

31:55.446 --> 31:56.981
Although I
can't believe he said that.

31:57.014 --> 31:58.025
It's kind of out of character.

31:58.049 --> 32:00.685
Out of character?
The guy's a dictator, not a

32:00.718 --> 32:04.588
director. He needs to remember
that he's teaching drama at a

32:04.621 --> 32:05.957
high school.

32:07.024 --> 32:08.201
What should I call this
one? What are you doing?

32:08.225 --> 32:12.964
Um, my name is Taylor and I'm
the lead in the play and every

32:12.997 --> 32:15.266
guy likes me and my life sucks.

32:15.299 --> 32:16.400
It's not funny.

32:16.434 --> 32:19.037
I'm gonna go to the best
college and everything sucks.

32:19.403 --> 32:23.374
Since when can you not take a
joke? Dude it's senior year. You

32:23.407 --> 32:27.512
did a beautiful job
tonight. What's wrong?

32:28.345 --> 32:31.549
Taylor, she's right. Plus we're
graduating soon anyway so it

32:31.582 --> 32:32.550
doesn't even matter.

32:32.583 --> 32:35.987
And we'll be on to
bigger and better things.

33:02.713 --> 33:04.581
I always forget
how big this house is.

33:04.615 --> 33:06.150
I'd kill to live in this house.

33:11.588 --> 33:13.324
Hm.

33:17.528 --> 33:18.362
What's this?

33:18.396 --> 33:20.732
Oh, come on.
Don't look so surprised.

33:22.699 --> 33:24.602
Same rules as last year.

33:24.635 --> 33:26.570
I promise I
won't take any photos.

33:26.603 --> 33:29.440
Emma come on, phones and
keys in the bucket. You know the

33:29.473 --> 33:33.310
rules. Last thing I need is
these fuckin' cops comin' here

33:33.343 --> 33:34.678
to ruin the party.

33:34.711 --> 33:37.381
Wow. Thought you were
actually being responsible.

33:37.414 --> 33:41.185
Dad's rules, okay? Not mine.

33:41.218 --> 33:45.122
Let's go. That a girl. Good

33:45.155 --> 33:47.158
girl. Good girl.

33:47.191 --> 33:49.227
Nice, nice. Good job.

33:58.836 --> 33:59.880
Well, I hear there's

33:59.904 --> 34:04.242
a party goin' on out
here. Who wants to turn it up?

34:06.544 --> 34:11.282
I said, who
wants to get fucked up?

34:13.250 --> 34:16.821
I see a lot of new faces
out here lookin' up at me like

34:16.853 --> 34:21.625
who is this guy?
Well I am the party master.

34:21.658 --> 34:25.696
Alright dad. Hey you're making
an ass out of yourself. Just go

34:25.728 --> 34:26.496
inside okay?

34:26.530 --> 34:28.466
Whatever you say son.

34:32.803 --> 34:34.737
Who wants to
get this party started?

34:59.796 --> 35:04.535
This gathering, unraveling
here before me my friends.

35:05.536 --> 35:07.305
This is the real party.

35:09.640 --> 35:14.612
Though I
have to say, must say that,

35:14.645 --> 35:17.481
I'm surprised
to see my dear Juliet

35:17.514 --> 35:21.819
at this Montague soiree.

35:23.320 --> 35:26.457
I'm just as
surprised as you are, trust me.

35:29.193 --> 35:32.897
Love is a smoke
made with the fume of sighs.

35:33.897 --> 35:38.536
In this case, the party
favors we shall all share.

35:41.405 --> 35:43.240
One for you.

35:43.273 --> 35:46.644
Hey listen, I
won't smoke too okay?

35:46.677 --> 35:50.481
Fuck it. I'm all in.

35:51.248 --> 35:54.385
I am
tired of being the smart girl,

35:54.418 --> 35:57.621
the good girl,
that boring ass lame girl.

35:57.654 --> 36:01.659
I am entitled to a
good night. I deserve it.

36:03.961 --> 36:08.665
Alright, that's what I'm talkin'
about. Lily, takin' a hit.

36:11.902 --> 36:13.604
Can we just go?

36:13.971 --> 36:16.874
Before one of us does something
that we're gonna regret.

36:22.579 --> 36:24.649
What is it buzzkill?

36:26.016 --> 36:28.252
Did you tell Miles?

36:28.952 --> 36:31.222
Don't worry about it.

36:48.739 --> 36:51.342
Don't worry.
I'm just gettin' it ready

36:51.375 --> 36:53.344
for a huntin' trip tomorrow.

36:53.377 --> 36:55.246
You havin' a fun time?

36:57.781 --> 37:00.317
Yeah, just
looking for the bathroom.

37:02.719 --> 37:06.390
Say, you're Taylor aren't you?

37:09.526 --> 37:12.529
I have heard an
awful lot about you.

37:13.830 --> 37:16.299
Hm.

37:16.700 --> 37:20.303
The uh, the bathroom's
just around the corner.

37:21.505 --> 37:22.740
Thanks.

37:52.803 --> 37:55.406
Taylor are you
okay? I'm worried about you.

37:56.540 --> 37:57.991
Taylor, open up I have to pee.

37:59.476 --> 38:01.579
Taylor.

38:06.016 --> 38:09.086
So, you and Vinnie huh?

38:09.119 --> 38:12.389
Okay, that is
like a one time thing.

38:12.422 --> 38:14.592
Are you really
gonna judge me for that?

38:15.359 --> 38:16.527
Why wouldn't I?

38:17.861 --> 38:21.432
Listen, I think it's great okay?

38:21.465 --> 38:24.635
Like crazy but great.

38:25.102 --> 38:27.937
Taylor we've been friends
for years. You really think I

38:27.971 --> 38:30.407
wouldn't notice? Not drinking,

38:30.440 --> 38:33.744
mood swings, not smoking.

38:33.944 --> 38:34.712
You're so pregnant.

38:34.745 --> 38:36.580
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, I'm pregnant.

38:38.882 --> 38:41.518
I mean like I knew it.
You have to tell me who.

38:41.551 --> 38:43.754
Like, I'm dying to know.

38:43.787 --> 38:46.557
Hannah, okay no one knows.

38:46.590 --> 38:48.959
Can we just keep
this between us please?

38:48.992 --> 38:52.496
Totally, yeah. Love you.

38:54.164 --> 38:56.667
Bathroom's all yours.

39:05.909 --> 39:08.812
Mr. Little, is
there a phone I can use?

39:08.845 --> 39:10.814
Is everything okay?

39:11.181 --> 39:14.852
Yeah, yeah everything's fine.
I just need to call my mom.

39:17.621 --> 39:19.757
Well I could give you a ride.

39:21.658 --> 39:25.096
No, no, no. It's
fine I just need to call her.

39:27.664 --> 39:31.034
Alright.
The phone's in the kitchen.

39:31.067 --> 39:32.970
Thanks.

39:38.108 --> 39:40.945
Well I'll, see you in a bit?

39:42.846 --> 39:44.782
Are you having fun?

39:44.815 --> 39:47.985
- Oh, hell yeah.
- Just need to find a good mixer.

39:48.018 --> 39:50.855
I'm tellin' you, we need
to do this every weekend.

39:51.521 --> 39:53.724
Hey have you talked to Tory?

39:53.757 --> 39:55.793
Mm mm. Haven't
seen her since the show.

39:56.059 --> 39:59.063
Damn. They've got a
lot of expired food in here.

40:00.564 --> 40:02.866
I'm sure Tory will show
though. She always does.

40:05.101 --> 40:07.972
You know, she
told me about uh...

40:10.674 --> 40:14.678
That was just a rumor.
You know how rumors spread.

40:14.711 --> 40:17.214
Even so, we've
kept our mouth shut.

40:17.247 --> 40:19.616
You and Tory don't get along

40:19.649 --> 40:21.952
but, I told her to
put herself in your shoes.

40:22.152 --> 40:25.088
Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with us.

40:25.121 --> 40:27.458
Well I appreciate that.

40:29.960 --> 40:34.432
That's disgusting. Why
don't you come join the party?

40:39.703 --> 40:43.574
Well, well, well. Just
in time for the competition.

40:45.208 --> 40:47.978
Winner gets my last blunt.

40:48.011 --> 40:49.747
Fantastic, just what I wanted.

40:50.247 --> 40:53.584
I saw you in
there, flirting with my man.

40:55.585 --> 40:57.955
First of all, he's not
your man. He has a girlfriend.

40:59.990 --> 41:03.060
In the spirit of fox hunting,
the favorite in my family, we

41:03.093 --> 41:06.897
shall be venturing
apart to the woods rather.

41:08.632 --> 41:11.936
See, in this particular
case I will be the fox.

41:12.302 --> 41:16.206
And you all are hounds.

41:16.239 --> 41:20.845
Oh yeah. First one
to catch me gets the prize.

41:21.745 --> 41:23.080
What are we five?

41:23.680 --> 41:25.616
Grab a flashlight.

41:25.649 --> 41:28.551
Begin to search
in uh, let's say 10 minutes.

41:37.160 --> 41:40.196
♪ EERIE SYNTH ♪

41:41.565 --> 41:43.676
I feel like you're quite the
hypocrite. What you did to her

41:43.700 --> 41:44.835
was just as bad.

41:45.602 --> 41:48.971
But, you're right she could
get in some serious trouble.

41:49.005 --> 41:52.309
She already is
in trouble. One of the girls in

41:52.342 --> 41:56.713
costuming overheard the police
talking. Apparently the guidance

41:56.746 --> 41:59.750
counselor left a message on
an answering machine. Something

41:59.783 --> 42:02.286
about someone coming
after Taylor or something.

42:02.319 --> 42:04.121
Jesus.

42:05.155 --> 42:08.559
Well, I'm glad we
don't have to deal with that.

42:14.631 --> 42:17.868
Hey. We done yet?

42:17.901 --> 42:19.937
Uh, no we are not done yet.

42:20.370 --> 42:22.272
Can we just go already?

42:22.305 --> 42:26.109
Appreciate your enthusiasm of
winning but I was being honest

42:26.142 --> 42:27.743
when I said I didn't wanna play.

42:27.777 --> 42:30.614
Uh, you owe us because you've
been a buzzkill all night.

42:30.647 --> 42:33.951
And that's coming from
Lily, so you know it's serious.

42:33.984 --> 42:35.619
Okay well this
is hardly productive.

42:35.652 --> 42:37.087
And you're the expert on that?

42:37.120 --> 42:41.223
All I'm saying
is you know if we split up it

42:41.257 --> 42:42.859
will increase our
chances of winning.

42:42.892 --> 42:45.261
You guys she's
totally right. If we

42:45.295 --> 42:48.866
all go our separate directions,
our chances of winning are gonna

42:50.166 --> 42:52.169
quadruple.

42:52.202 --> 42:54.104
That's exactly what I just said.

42:54.904 --> 42:57.675
Okay well, thank you. Bye.

44:23.893 --> 44:25.095
Fuck you!

44:44.280 --> 44:45.716
Guys!

44:45.749 --> 44:47.283
Taylor, what's wrong?

44:47.317 --> 44:48.394
There, there's
someone in the woods.

44:48.418 --> 44:49.820
What do you mean?

44:49.853 --> 44:52.431
Wait you, you didn't hear that
scream? They're, they're coming.

44:52.455 --> 44:54.175
Taylor, what the
fuck is wrong with you huh?

44:54.791 --> 44:58.095
I mean get your shit together.
God damn, it's a good thing she

44:58.128 --> 44:59.730
didn't smoke
any pot tonight huh?

44:59.763 --> 45:01.865
I think that's
exactly what she needs.

45:01.898 --> 45:04.301
Come on guys. You,
you didn't hear that scream?

45:05.468 --> 45:07.270
Okay what, what
about Chloe and Matt.

45:07.303 --> 45:08.438
How uh, what about them?

45:08.471 --> 45:12.009
Ain't it obvious? Ran into
the woods on the bang train.

45:12.942 --> 45:16.813
Clearly my man's about
to nut. Lucky mother fucker.

45:16.846 --> 45:21.485
I don't feel so good.

45:22.986 --> 45:24.888
Jesus Billy, you drink much?

45:26.790 --> 45:29.159
I'm fine, really.
Pour, pour me another.

45:29.192 --> 45:30.503
Guys he's gotta
go to the hospital.

45:30.527 --> 45:33.096
I tell you, I only
saw him take a few shots okay?

45:33.129 --> 45:34.831
Alright son, the party is over.

45:34.864 --> 45:37.409
- Wait, I've been keepin' an eye on him all night dad.
- No. There is too much liability.

45:37.433 --> 45:38.401
Billy, can you hear me?

45:38.434 --> 45:40.112
We can't risk this
happening to anybody else

45:40.136 --> 45:41.971
so put the booze away.

45:42.005 --> 45:43.282
Dad look,
this is fuckin' bullshit okay?

45:43.306 --> 45:46.877
No. Not this time.
You either do as I say

45:46.910 --> 45:50.080
This is not my fault.
or you're
not going
hunting tomorrow.

45:51.147 --> 45:54.017
Alright everybody, I
need ya to hang tight inside.

45:54.417 --> 45:57.554
I'm gonna drive Billy to the
hospital and when I get back

45:57.587 --> 46:00.257
I'll drive each
and every one of you home.

46:00.290 --> 46:03.426
You're not to drive
yourselves and you're not to

46:03.459 --> 46:06.096
leave the property
until I get back, understand?

46:06.129 --> 46:09.065
The last thing we need is
another incident like this.

46:09.098 --> 46:10.400
Help me carry him to the car.

46:17.207 --> 46:18.542
Alright, let's go inside.

46:21.477 --> 46:23.147
Let's go.

46:46.502 --> 46:50.574
Where do you
think you're goin', hm?

46:58.281 --> 47:02.018
Unless you want me squatting on
your basement floor, I suggest

47:02.051 --> 47:04.488
you move, please.

48:26.069 --> 48:29.572
I'm sorry,
did I scare you? And did

48:29.605 --> 48:33.443
you by chance
mistake this for a bathroom? Hm?

48:34.444 --> 48:36.046
Did you?

48:38.014 --> 48:40.083
God, you're a tricky one.

48:42.085 --> 48:46.022
Great actress too but, I'll tell
you what if you're lookin' for

48:46.055 --> 48:50.192
the condoms, 'cause this
ain't the drawer I keep 'em in.

48:51.394 --> 48:53.497
Okay you need
to stop talking like that.

48:53.730 --> 48:55.398
It's not funny anymore Miles.

48:55.431 --> 48:59.069
And yet, you're the
one who came to my room.

49:01.037 --> 49:03.439
Ever heard of sending
mixed signals Taylor?

49:05.041 --> 49:08.178
I'm sorry or
should I say, Juliet?

49:11.647 --> 49:12.791
I've always wanted to roll play.

49:12.815 --> 49:16.987
Fuck off. What's it gonna
take you to leave me alone.

49:17.020 --> 49:18.455
You see it's complicated there.

49:38.141 --> 49:40.643
So anyone have
plans this weekend?

49:40.676 --> 49:42.212
I feel like shit.

49:42.245 --> 49:47.116
I might see a movie. Hannah?

49:47.750 --> 49:50.487
Would you wanna come with me?

49:51.821 --> 49:55.258
Uh...

49:57.126 --> 49:58.762
Fuck it. I
haven't had a drink

49:58.795 --> 50:03.533
in ages. I'm fine. Bye guys.

50:08.071 --> 50:10.440
I got a little secret for you.

50:10.473 --> 50:12.609
It's a little one.

50:12.642 --> 50:15.611
And I've been waiting
for this fuckin' moment

50:17.513 --> 50:19.348
for a long time Taylor.

50:19.382 --> 50:20.583
What are you talking about?

50:20.617 --> 50:24.454
What am I talking about? Hm,
let me think. How 'bout you, me,

50:24.487 --> 50:28.591
alone together. In fact
the funny thing is Taylor,

50:28.624 --> 50:30.493
the funny thing is I
didn't picture being here

50:30.526 --> 50:31.728
in my bedroom of all places.

50:31.761 --> 50:33.463
- Miles...
- No you fuckin' listen.

50:35.765 --> 50:37.667
I know all about it Taylor.

50:38.468 --> 50:39.845
I mean if
you could sleep with him right,

50:39.869 --> 50:43.073
you could
fuckin' sleep with me, right?

50:44.173 --> 50:46.642
But don't worry, shh.

50:47.543 --> 50:52.148
Your secret's safe with
me for a price. Little price.

50:52.181 --> 50:53.717
You're drunk.

50:54.517 --> 50:57.352
Mm hm. You see I know what
you're capable of now, I do.

50:57.386 --> 50:58.455
Mm hm.

51:00.556 --> 51:02.192
And guess what?

51:06.162 --> 51:08.231
I kinda, I kinda like it.

51:08.698 --> 51:09.699
No, no. I'm, I'm...

51:09.733 --> 51:13.303
Uh uh uh. See, I know
what you're capable of now

51:13.336 --> 51:16.705
and in a
funny way your brought this upon

51:16.739 --> 51:18.341
yourself Tay Tay.

51:19.909 --> 51:22.679
Okay now this
is how we're gonna proceed.

51:22.712 --> 51:24.414
I'm gonna remove my hands.

51:24.447 --> 51:26.817
If you
fuckin' say a single word,

51:27.917 --> 51:33.089
if you mutter, mutter
a single yelp guess what?

51:35.525 --> 51:38.161
Your secret will be
a secret no more man.

51:38.528 --> 51:41.497
I'll shout it down the hallway.
I'll shout it from the rooftop.

51:42.598 --> 51:47.137
Oh. Oh, is she gonna cry?

51:48.304 --> 51:49.773
Oh come on.

51:50.373 --> 51:52.242
Really, I was
only joking with you.

51:57.446 --> 51:59.281
You like it rough huh baby?

52:00.650 --> 52:01.852
What the fuck's that face for?

52:23.439 --> 52:24.707
We need to get out of here!

52:24.740 --> 52:25.841
Whoa, slow down.

52:25.875 --> 52:27.186
What, what's
going on? What happened?

52:27.210 --> 52:28.578
There's something after me Emma.

52:28.611 --> 52:30.446
What?
What are you talking about?

52:30.479 --> 52:32.948
Someone was following
me uh, was chasing me.

52:32.982 --> 52:35.817
No one's chasing you.
Come on, sit down. Have a drink.

52:35.851 --> 52:37.587
No, I don't need
a drink. It got Miles.

52:37.620 --> 52:39.622
Taylor's what's,
what's wrong? Are you okay?

52:39.655 --> 52:40.790
Where's Hannah?

52:40.823 --> 52:42.734
She went back to the school
to get her spare car keys.

52:42.758 --> 52:44.359
No, no. You
shouldn't have let her go

52:44.393 --> 52:45.837
out there by
herself. It is dangerous.

52:45.861 --> 52:48.731
Alright, look uh,
sorry to interrupt

52:48.764 --> 52:50.366
but what were you
saying about Miles?

52:50.399 --> 52:51.901
He's dead! Okay?

52:51.934 --> 52:55.272
Something is up there trying
to get me, trying to get us.

52:56.706 --> 52:58.417
No, no. You're
just trying to scare us. This

52:58.441 --> 53:00.743
just seems like
one of Miles classic jokes.

53:04.947 --> 53:06.383
We should get out of here.

53:10.453 --> 53:11.497
How's that
gonna protect you?

53:11.521 --> 53:13.398
He's got the right
idea. It's better than nothing.

53:13.422 --> 53:14.824
Okay yeah.

53:40.750 --> 53:43.920
Guys we look like idiots. Okay?
What am I gonna do with this?

53:43.953 --> 53:45.797
What are any of us
gonna do with any of this stuff?

53:45.821 --> 53:47.890
No, we're puttin' this
down. We're done with this.

53:47.923 --> 53:50.392
Alright, look
there's four of us,

53:50.426 --> 53:53.462
there's me, we got this.

53:53.496 --> 53:56.233
Hey, what's goin' on?

53:57.366 --> 53:58.868
Where's Miles?

54:21.791 --> 54:25.996
Hannah! Hannah! Hannah!

54:29.732 --> 54:30.976
I'm so sorry
I doubted you Taylor.

54:31.000 --> 54:31.801
I thought you were going crazy.

54:31.834 --> 54:32.945
We just have to
look for a weapon.

54:32.969 --> 54:35.305
Maybe it's just me but I
don't know, don't you think

54:35.338 --> 54:37.407
it's possible we're
all just on some crazy trip?

54:37.440 --> 54:40.743
I mean, I
smoked a lotta weed tonight.

54:40.776 --> 54:43.879
Or the thing that
killed Grace is hunting us down?

54:45.681 --> 54:47.059
Where are you going?
We have to stick together.

54:47.083 --> 54:49.452
I'm just drainin'
the snake. Chill out.

54:49.485 --> 54:51.888
Look, I'll be right back.

54:53.556 --> 54:55.325
Freakin' idiot.

54:55.825 --> 54:57.636
We're just gonna stick
together and we'll be safe.

54:57.660 --> 54:59.071
Why don't we
just get the fuck out of here.

54:59.095 --> 55:00.596
- What about Hannah?
- What about her?

55:00.629 --> 55:02.464
Her car's still
outside. She could be in here.

55:02.498 --> 55:03.499
Not our problem.

55:03.532 --> 55:04.467
I hardly think that it's...

55:04.500 --> 55:06.536
No, she, she,
she's right. We need to look for

55:06.569 --> 55:08.404
Hannah.
She would do the same for us.

55:10.005 --> 55:11.107
Get out!

55:14.710 --> 55:15.678
Hold on!

55:15.711 --> 55:16.712
Go, go, go, go, go!

55:17.913 --> 55:19.349
Get out!

55:27.456 --> 55:30.060
No! No! No!

55:41.737 --> 55:44.540
This is taking too long.
If we split up it'll go faster.

55:44.573 --> 55:45.975
Lets meet in
10 at the cafeteria.

55:46.442 --> 55:47.910
If you find a
phone call for help.

55:47.943 --> 55:49.612
Emma!

55:51.414 --> 55:54.751
Can I go with you I, I
don't really wanna go alone.

55:55.418 --> 55:56.486
Yeah.

55:59.688 --> 56:00.824
It's dead.

56:01.924 --> 56:03.860
Taylor, who do you
think's behind all this?

56:03.893 --> 56:05.862
If I knew that
I wouldn't be standing here.

56:06.929 --> 56:09.499
It's gotta be the
janitor. I mean like, the

56:09.532 --> 56:12.001
janitor shows up, the guidance
counselor's murdered and now

56:12.034 --> 56:14.570
we're around being
hunted like wild animals.

56:14.603 --> 56:16.439
I don't think
he's capable of murder.

56:18.507 --> 56:21.110
But cutting
the phone line? Taylor.

56:21.143 --> 56:23.513
What?

56:27.016 --> 56:28.852
Okay come on, let's go.

56:32.555 --> 56:33.923
Here we go.

57:01.250 --> 57:03.152
We're stuck in here.

57:03.185 --> 57:05.422
Yeah well, at least
we're not out in the open.

57:10.559 --> 57:12.562
I'm sorry.

57:13.996 --> 57:17.534
For what? It's not your fault.

57:19.235 --> 57:20.937
Did you know?

57:24.106 --> 57:26.509
Hey. Taylor!

57:28.644 --> 57:30.212
It's not a big deal.

57:31.280 --> 57:32.715
I know what Emma did.

57:48.564 --> 57:50.200
Emma?

57:50.699 --> 57:54.637
What's going on?
Taylor are you okay?

57:56.539 --> 57:58.041
We need to hide.

58:00.643 --> 58:02.011
What's going on? What happened?

58:02.645 --> 58:04.514
Where's Lily?

58:10.586 --> 58:12.666
We have to get out of
this school. It's a death trap.

58:13.756 --> 58:15.758
If only I
hadn't thrown in my keys.

58:17.893 --> 58:22.131
I think I have an
idea. Can you drive stick?

58:26.035 --> 58:28.069
I don't know about this Taylor.

58:28.103 --> 58:29.238
The boiler room

58:29.271 --> 58:33.142
is connected to the offices
in the basement, I think.

58:34.276 --> 58:36.312
Well, what have you
like, been down here before?

58:36.345 --> 58:38.180
No.

58:38.213 --> 58:40.016
And you're sure
the transportation

58:40.049 --> 58:41.817
coordinator's
office is on the other side?

58:43.152 --> 58:46.722
I guess so. We either cut
through here or we go back to

58:46.755 --> 58:48.558
that hallway with
that lurking thing around.

58:48.958 --> 58:50.193
What do you wanna do?

58:52.695 --> 58:54.264
Watch your head.

58:56.699 --> 58:58.701
Taylor, Taylor!

58:58.734 --> 58:59.769
Hannah! Oh my God!

59:02.705 --> 59:04.307
We need the key.

59:07.176 --> 59:10.947
Drew? Drew?

59:13.115 --> 59:16.986
Drew is that you? Is that you?

59:21.657 --> 59:22.625
Taylor!

59:22.658 --> 59:23.860
Hold on!

59:35.204 --> 59:36.906
Taylor!

59:39.074 --> 59:40.276
Help me!

59:43.379 --> 59:46.348
Help
me! Where are you going?

59:48.117 --> 59:49.785
That'll be us if we
don't get out of here.

59:49.818 --> 59:51.730
Let's go
to the subway.
No. We should
stay and fight.

59:51.754 --> 59:53.689
Taylor, have you
lost your fucking mind?

59:53.722 --> 59:55.000
Do you hear what
just happened to Hannah?

59:55.024 --> 59:56.801
She got sliced and
diced like a fucking vegetable!

59:56.825 --> 59:58.394
Yeah, well
that's why we should stay!

59:58.427 --> 01:00:00.830
Taylor! Take a look around us.

01:00:00.863 --> 01:00:02.865
We've watched as
our friends have been murdered

01:00:02.898 --> 01:00:05.068
in cold blood and
you don't seem to give a fuck.

01:00:05.734 --> 01:00:07.036
I'm getting out of here.

01:00:08.404 --> 01:00:10.607
I'm not
the one you need to worry about.

01:00:12.441 --> 01:00:13.977
I'm, I'm gong with you.

01:00:16.378 --> 01:00:18.181
Fuck!

01:00:20.349 --> 01:00:21.818
We're in here!

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:27.290
We're in here, let us out!

01:00:28.290 --> 01:00:31.661
Fuck, fuck! We're in here!

01:00:31.694 --> 01:00:33.763
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:00:50.946 --> 01:00:52.915
You bastard!

01:01:03.926 --> 01:01:05.028
Come on, Emma.

01:01:07.796 --> 01:01:09.165
CREEPY SYNTHESIZER

01:01:10.065 --> 01:01:13.002
My God. We have to help them.

01:01:19.108 --> 01:01:20.309
Do you see that?

01:01:22.177 --> 01:01:23.980
This is too much.

01:01:26.515 --> 01:01:28.417
That's gross, he's like 40.

01:01:28.450 --> 01:01:29.884
Who do we tell?

01:01:31.487 --> 01:01:32.698
The principle's
gone for the day.

01:01:32.722 --> 01:01:37.326
I'll think about what to do.
I'll make a decision by tonight.

01:01:37.359 --> 01:01:41.163
It's very important Taylor
does not know that you saw this.

01:01:42.931 --> 01:01:45.068
I saw your
little hump fest out back.

01:01:45.534 --> 01:01:47.737
It was a one time thing.

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:49.439
I'm not the one
you need to worry about.

01:01:50.305 --> 01:01:52.841
You little fucking slut.

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:54.744
Cum dumpster
sounds more like it.

01:01:55.477 --> 01:01:57.046
Don't worry, we're here to help.

01:01:59.915 --> 01:02:03.919
It would be over
immediately if this got out.

01:02:03.952 --> 01:02:05.454
Don't worry,
we've got this covered.

01:02:05.487 --> 01:02:07.365
Hey I was just kidding
alright? Don't actually do it.

01:02:07.389 --> 01:02:09.425
- Don't pussy out.
- Like you said, it's

01:02:09.458 --> 01:02:11.094
what's best for her future.

01:02:17.432 --> 01:02:19.067
Next time wear protection.

01:02:19.101 --> 01:02:20.770
We can't always
be there to help you.

01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:43.893
I mean think about your career.

01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:19.862
Taylor, Can you hear me?

01:03:21.129 --> 01:03:23.933
You've been
through quite a lot young lady.

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:26.301
Do you know how lucky you are?

01:03:28.003 --> 01:03:31.808
Can you remember
much? Anything at all? Anything?

01:03:39.948 --> 01:03:41.292
What the
fuck's that face for?

01:03:50.392 --> 01:03:53.062
It's all sort of a blur.

01:03:54.096 --> 01:03:57.066
That's okay.

01:03:57.633 --> 01:04:00.236
These things take time.

01:04:00.602 --> 01:04:04.106
Listen,
I'll let you get some rest and

01:04:04.139 --> 01:04:06.108
we can talk about it later.

01:04:07.175 --> 01:04:09.412
If I'm not
mistaken, you have a visitor.

01:04:10.579 --> 01:04:12.514
Oh, before I forget

01:04:12.547 --> 01:04:15.351
congratulations
on the little one.

01:04:16.551 --> 01:04:20.589
Oh. Uh, thank you.

01:04:20.622 --> 01:04:24.058
Uh, can we keep this between us.

01:04:24.092 --> 01:04:26.596
Yes.

01:04:42.477 --> 01:04:45.013
I came as soon as I heard.

01:04:45.547 --> 01:04:49.151
It's so good to see you awake.

01:04:54.356 --> 01:04:57.493
Do you, wanna talk
about what happened?

01:05:02.464 --> 01:05:04.333
He was abusing me.

01:05:04.366 --> 01:05:07.202
I'm still not sure
about this whole plan of yours.

01:05:07.235 --> 01:05:08.304
Well do you love me?

01:05:08.337 --> 01:05:11.207
That's not fair. You know I do.

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:14.209
And I didn't
know how to tell you mom.

01:05:14.242 --> 01:05:16.578
Well you've seen the
shows, you've read the books,

01:05:16.611 --> 01:05:18.714
you know how this is gonna end.

01:05:18.747 --> 01:05:23.019
Local teacher sleeps
with an underage student

01:05:23.352 --> 01:05:25.988
while dating
her mom at the same time.

01:05:26.021 --> 01:05:29.024
I'm so, so sorry sweetie.

01:05:29.057 --> 01:05:33.162
Best case scenario you get
prison. Have to live your life

01:05:33.195 --> 01:05:36.465
out there. The
worst case scenario...

01:05:38.066 --> 01:05:42.104
Look the way I see it
you have two options.

01:05:42.137 --> 01:05:43.372
Help me kill them all.

01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:47.542
Or fuck
it, go turn yourself in now.

01:05:50.479 --> 01:05:55.350
Hey. We're in this together.

01:05:55.384 --> 01:05:59.688
Let's just contain the
situation before it spreads.

01:05:59.721 --> 01:06:04.360
I, I wish I had seen the
signs. I, I can't even begin to

01:06:04.393 --> 01:06:08.431
understand what you've
been through these past...

01:06:09.297 --> 01:06:11.300
Just the three girls.

01:06:12.567 --> 01:06:14.637
Just three girls?

01:06:16.405 --> 01:06:18.107
Mm hm.

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:23.078
I know what Emma
did. But I, I can keep a secret.

01:06:23.111 --> 01:06:25.314
You weren't
supposed to be a part of this.

01:06:25.347 --> 01:06:28.584
It's okay. That's
what friends are for.

01:06:28.617 --> 01:06:31.653
No. You don't understand.

01:06:43.131 --> 01:06:44.098
I mean, did...

01:06:44.132 --> 01:06:46.535
It's okay. You know, we

01:06:46.568 --> 01:06:50.006
don't have to talk about it.

01:06:54.676 --> 01:06:57.813
I uh, I, I brought something

01:06:57.846 --> 01:07:01.017
that I thought
might cheer you up.

01:07:21.369 --> 01:07:23.672
Can't believe
we pulled this off.

01:07:24.306 --> 01:07:27.509
I still don't understand why
you wanted me to take pictures

01:07:27.542 --> 01:07:29.178
of all the bodies.

01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:32.348
It's all part
of the plan. The bigger picture.

01:07:32.647 --> 01:07:34.516
You seem upset, what's wrong?

01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:36.251
You weren't
supposed to hurt Drew.

01:07:36.284 --> 01:07:39.354
Couldn't be helped. I wasn't
going to ruin the whole thing

01:07:39.387 --> 01:07:42.558
because of one person. He was
out snooping where he shouldn't

01:07:42.591 --> 01:07:46.662
have been. Don't be mad.

01:07:50.198 --> 01:07:52.301
I got you quite the nightcap.

01:07:53.435 --> 01:07:55.270
Hope you like it.

01:07:58.907 --> 01:08:00.376
Shut up!

01:08:00.775 --> 01:08:04.613
Arthur. Too bad
you were stuck here all night.

01:08:04.846 --> 01:08:07.783
You missed
quite the performance.

01:08:08.183 --> 01:08:10.185
You want me to do
it? I've gotten pretty good.

01:08:10.218 --> 01:08:11.553
No.

01:08:12.854 --> 01:08:16.492
You tried to ruin my career,

01:08:16.524 --> 01:08:19.594
my plans, my future.

01:08:22.863 --> 01:08:24.232
I've got this.

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:34.310
I told
you that you would get in.

01:08:37.845 --> 01:08:40.182
I guess all the
practicing paid off.

01:08:40.215 --> 01:08:41.383
Catch.

01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:45.220
We're finished
right? What's next?

01:08:53.627 --> 01:08:55.363
I never really loved you.

01:09:10.345 --> 01:09:13.616
Um, did anyone make it?

01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:16.684
What?

01:09:16.718 --> 01:09:20.889
Um, out of the house.
Did anyone else escape?

01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:26.761
Just you and that
uh, Billy boy from class.

01:09:26.795 --> 01:09:29.832
Apparently he
got here just in time.

01:09:31.566 --> 01:09:33.468
You know
he's uh, down the hallway.

01:09:33.501 --> 01:09:37.305
When you're feeling better,
you should go and visit him.

01:09:37.339 --> 01:09:40.276
I'm sure that he
would love to see your face.

01:09:56.825 --> 01:09:58.393
Taylor?

01:09:58.426 --> 01:09:59.628
