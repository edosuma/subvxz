WEBVTT

00:10.597 --> 00:13.103
Faster, Frasier, faster!

00:13.103 --> 00:14.310
You can make this light!

00:14.310 --> 00:16.251
God, you're going to get us killed!

00:16.251 --> 00:20.343
I can't be late for this date!

00:20.343 --> 00:22.004
Oh, this is ridiculous!

00:22.004 --> 00:23.734
First the drycleaner, then the ATM,

00:23.734 --> 00:25.955
now you're making me cart you off to some restaurant!

00:25.955 --> 00:28.699
Well, I'm sorry, I didn't plan for
my car to be in the shop.

00:28.699 --> 00:31.561
But I really, really appreciate it, Frasier.

00:31.561 --> 00:35.548
Oh, a basket of fruit would suffice!

00:35.548 --> 00:37.762
I am changing for my date!

00:37.762 --> 00:38.819
Don't look at me!  Turn around!

00:38.819 --> 00:40.110
Turn all the way around!

00:40.110 --> 00:41.118
I'm driving!

00:41.118 --> 00:44.445
Fine!

00:44.445 --> 00:45.620
Hand me my jeans, will you?

00:45.620 --> 00:48.510
Here.

00:48.510 --> 00:51.996
Oh, oh, great! That's just what i need!

00:51.996 --> 00:53.759
There's a police car behind us.

00:53.759 --> 00:54.969
Please don't turn on the red light.

00:54.969 --> 00:56.238
Don't turn on the red light.

00:56.238 --> 00:57.988
Don't turn on the

00:57.988 --> 01:01.989
Damn it, Frasier!

01:01.989 --> 01:04.415
Don't worry, you're not going to get a ticket.

01:04.415 --> 01:06.173
You're a celebrity, use a little juice!

01:06.173 --> 01:07.927
Oh, I refuse to do anything of the sort!

01:07.927 --> 01:14.923
OK, fine.  Enjoy traffic school.

01:14.923 --> 01:21.219
Good Evening, officer.
I'm Doctor Fraiser Crane
If there's any problem I'm listening.

01:21.219 --> 01:25.275
I clocked you doing sixty-two in a forty-mile zone.

01:25.275 --> 01:28.043
Well, this is interesting.

01:28.043 --> 01:30.011
Usually both people are in the backseat.

01:30.011 --> 01:33.112
It's not what you think.

01:33.112 --> 01:37.743
See, we were just coming back from KACL,
where I do my radio show.

01:37.743 --> 01:40.080
Uh-huh.

01:40.080 --> 01:42.321
You see, we ran a little late,

01:42.321 --> 01:44.201
because I was on with a very troubled caller,

01:44.201 --> 01:50.766
with a very complex psychological problem...
on my radio show.

01:50.766 --> 01:51.937
Hey, wait a minute.

01:51.937 --> 01:54.313
You're Dr. Frasier Crane!

01:54.313 --> 01:57.547
Drat!  My cover is blown.

01:57.547 --> 01:58.697
I love your show!

01:58.697 --> 01:59.904
I listen to it all the time.

01:59.904 --> 02:01.074
Oh well, thank you.

02:01.074 --> 02:02.607
It's always nice to...

02:02.607 --> 02:06.262
License and registration, please.

02:06.262 --> 02:11.431
Be arrested by a fan.

02:11.431 --> 02:13.783
Roz, if you could delay ablutions?

02:13.783 --> 02:16.658
I'm in custody here!

02:16.658 --> 02:19.825
Hey, it's your birthday today.

02:19.825 --> 02:22.351
Is this a little celebration?

02:22.351 --> 02:27.402
No, no, I'm simply taking
my producer to meet her date.

02:27.402 --> 02:29.794
Frasier, why didn't you tell me
it was your birthday?

02:29.794 --> 02:32.062
I'd have thrown you a party at the station!

02:32.062 --> 02:35.808
Question asked, question answered.

02:35.808 --> 02:37.999
I'm just going to be dropping her off,

02:37.999 --> 02:43.295
then have a cold plate of deli,
and get to bed early.

02:43.295 --> 02:46.728
Almost makes you feel sorry for me, doesn't it?

02:46.728 --> 02:49.337
I spent my last birthday subduing
a drunk-and-disorderly

02:49.337 --> 02:51.311
at a sleazy bar.

02:51.311 --> 02:53.229
Don't you hate to work on your birthday?

02:53.229 --> 02:56.134
He was my date.

02:56.134 --> 02:57.240
Tell you what I'm going to do.

02:57.240 --> 02:58.383
I'm going to let you off.

02:58.383 --> 03:00.528
Just think of this as
a little birthday gift from me.

03:00.528 --> 03:01.535
Thank you.

03:01.535 --> 03:04.326
But slow down.

03:04.326 --> 03:06.943
I'd hate to see you get hurt.

03:06.943 --> 03:12.071
I'm listening.

03:12.071 --> 03:17.080
OK, let's go!

03:17.080 --> 03:20.016
Do you sense a little moment there?

03:20.016 --> 03:21.408
What are you talking about?!

03:21.408 --> 03:24.052
Well, between me and that
very attractive officer.

03:24.052 --> 03:27.496
It just felt like there was something there.

03:27.496 --> 03:28.945
Yeah, major sparks.

03:28.945 --> 03:30.262
Now, just the right pedal.

03:30.262 --> 03:30.829
The big pedal?

03:30.829 --> 03:32.495
Now, just a minute.

03:32.495 --> 03:33.581
We'll see if she's watching me.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.864
If she's watching me, she's interested.

03:35.864 --> 03:39.529
Oh, yes!  She's turning around, she's looking up!

03:39.529 --> 03:45.517
Move your vehicle!

03:45.517 --> 03:53.711
Oh, yes.  I've cast my spell.<SYNC Start=230580

03:53.711 --> 03:55.748
Go on, Dr. Crane, make a wish.

03:55.748 --> 03:57.159
Oh, why bother?

03:57.159 --> 04:04.800
I made the same wish last year,
it didn't come true.

04:04.800 --> 04:07.214
Come on, son, blow out the candles!

04:13.789 --> 04:15.550
Oh, what a surprise.

04:15.550 --> 04:17.878
Look, they're lighting again!

04:17.878 --> 04:22.638
What sorcerer's magic is this?

04:22.638 --> 04:25.887
You know, Dad, I had a nice
little birthday bonus today.

04:25.887 --> 04:29.286
On my way home, I was pulled over
for speeding by a very pretty

04:29.286 --> 04:32.384
policewoman, who let me off.

04:32.384 --> 04:34.828
I got the distinct impression
that she found me attractive.

04:34.828 --> 04:36.119
Now, that sort of thing happens, doesn't it?

04:36.119 --> 04:36.886
Oh, sure.

04:36.886 --> 04:39.571
I was always leaning against
somebody's window thinking,

04:39.571 --> 04:42.548
"that bloody chainsaw in the
backseat looks kind of iffy,

04:42.548 --> 04:45.899
but she's got a cute smile!"

04:45.899 --> 04:47.719
Oh, ha, ha.

04:47.719 --> 04:49.677
I'm telling you, there was something there, though.

04:49.677 --> 04:52.405
Well, of course the whole conversation's academic.

04:52.405 --> 04:54.061
I don't even know her name.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.375
I suppose I could call down to the police station

04:56.375 --> 04:58.924
and try to find out who was on traffic duty.

04:58.924 --> 05:03.467
But, uh, I don't suppose they'd give
that sort of information to a civilian.

05:03.467 --> 05:04.756
You'd have to have some...

05:04.756 --> 05:09.871
conduit to the police department,
an insider who could break

05:09.871 --> 05:13.594
that damnable code of silence!

05:13.594 --> 05:16.478
All right, I'll make the damn call.

05:16.478 --> 05:17.582
You, Dad?

05:17.582 --> 05:18.454
Why, I didn't even think of?

05:18.454 --> 05:22.045
Oh, shut up.

05:22.045 --> 05:24.423
You know, I haven't felt such
an instant attraction

05:24.423 --> 05:26.614
to a woman in quite some time.

05:26.614 --> 05:28.733
Well, considering the difference
in our backgrounds,

05:28.733 --> 05:30.188
it's really rather puzzling.

05:30.188 --> 05:34.653
Oh, pish-tosh!

05:34.653 --> 05:36.467
It's painfully obvious what's attracting you

05:36.467 --> 05:40.893
the gleam of her jackboots,
her dangling nightstick,

05:40.893 --> 05:44.909
the glint of her handcuffs hanging
on her leather belt.

05:44.909 --> 05:50.661
You're off on some lurid little disciplinary fantasy.

05:50.661 --> 05:53.069
Oh, Dr. Crane, shame on you!

05:53.069 --> 05:55.428
You got icing up and down your sleeve!

05:55.428 --> 06:00.829
Oh.  I am a naughty boy.

06:00.829 --> 06:02.924
Well, certainly a messy one.

06:02.924 --> 06:06.251
But mainly a naughty one.

06:06.251 --> 06:09.065
Hey, Charlie, yeah, Marty Crane, how ya doing?

06:09.065 --> 06:12.171
Hey, listen, Charlie, I'm trying to track down a woman

06:12.171 --> 06:16.028
officer who was on traffic tonight, uh, near...

06:16.028 --> 06:16.786
Blanchett and Fourth.

06:16.786 --> 06:18.387
Blanchett and Fourth.

06:18.387 --> 06:21.251
Great, OK, thanks.

06:21.251 --> 06:22.444
Her name's Maureen Cutler,

06:22.444 --> 06:24.683
and she usually goes to McGinty's after work.

06:24.683 --> 06:26.380
Charlie said she's probably there now.

06:26.380 --> 06:28.123
Thanks, Dad.

06:28.123 --> 06:29.000
Are you going to go?

06:29.000 --> 06:30.732
Well, I don't know.

06:30.732 --> 06:31.205
A police bar?

06:31.205 --> 06:33.843
If I go in there alone, I'll stand
out like a sore thumb!

06:33.843 --> 06:37.081
All right, I'll go.

06:37.081 --> 06:41.204
Sit down, Niles, I'll go with him.

06:41.204 --> 06:44.572
You know, after all these hoity-toity,
caviar-sucking egghead types

06:44.572 --> 06:46.786
you've been dating, I think a lady cop

06:46.786 --> 06:49.200
would be a nice breath of fresh air.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.313
Oh, all right, I'll go!

06:51.313 --> 06:53.978
Give me a second, I'll put some fresh collar-stays in,

06:53.978 --> 06:56.938
and-oh, oh, I've got a fabulous brand-new cashmere jacket

06:56.938 --> 07:00.827
I've been dying to premiere!

07:00.827 --> 07:03.837
Oh, yeah.  This is gonna work.

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:12.139 --> 07:13.157
You see her yet?

07:13.157 --> 07:15.994
I don't know.

07:15.994 --> 07:17.625
What about her?

07:17.625 --> 07:18.860
No, that's not Maureen.

07:18.860 --> 07:24.091
No, I mean, what about her?

07:24.091 --> 07:26.144
Oh, there she is!

07:26.144 --> 07:32.225
Wow, she is a looker!
Well, come on, let's go say hello.

07:32.225 --> 07:37.779
Oh well!  Oh my God, fancy seeing you here!

07:37.779 --> 07:38.994
Hey, Frasier Crane.

07:38.994 --> 07:40.543
Oh, you remember me?

07:40.543 --> 07:43.170
Come on ?sixty-two in a forty-mile zone
with a half-naked

07:43.170 --> 07:47.017
girl in the backseat?

07:47.017 --> 07:47.611
Roz.

07:47.611 --> 07:49.794
Oh.

07:49.794 --> 07:52.136
Oh, uh, this is my father.

07:52.136 --> 07:53.936
How do you do?  I'm Maureen Cutler.

07:53.936 --> 07:55.403
Marty Crane, nice to meet you.

07:55.403 --> 07:56.946
Nice to meet you.

07:56.946 --> 07:58.800
Say, Maureen, how about a drink?

07:58.800 --> 07:59.688
Yeah, why not?

07:59.688 --> 08:00.909
Let me get them.

08:00.909 --> 08:02.617
I'm a beer drinker myself, what about you?

08:02.617 --> 08:03.673
That's fine by me.

08:03.673 --> 08:04.841
Beer, huh?

08:04.841 --> 08:09.910
Oh, what the hell, I'll try one.

08:09.910 --> 08:13.353
So, what brings you guys here?
This is mostly a cop hangout.

08:13.353 --> 08:14.471
Well, I used to be on the force.

08:14.471 --> 08:14.891
Really?

08:14.891 --> 08:15.969
Yeah.

08:15.969 --> 08:17.240
Wait a minute.

08:17.240 --> 08:20.997
Marty Crane?  You're Martin Crane!

08:20.997 --> 08:24.737
You're wasting your time in traffic,
you're quite a detective.

08:24.737 --> 08:27.638
No, I mean I remember you when I was training.

08:27.638 --> 08:29.642
You gave this great lecture at the academy on

08:29.642 --> 08:31.030
how to deal with an armed suspect.

08:31.030 --> 08:32.457
Well, thanks.

08:32.457 --> 08:34.272
How come you left the force?

08:34.272 --> 08:39.903
Well, I uh, got shot by an armed suspect.

08:39.903 --> 08:40.481
I'm sorry.

08:40.481 --> 08:42.174
Oh, it's all right.

08:42.174 --> 08:44.617
So, do you miss it?

08:44.617 --> 08:51.838
Nah, how attached can you get to a hip?

08:51.838 --> 08:53.823
Oh.  Oh, I'm sorry.

08:53.823 --> 08:56.247
I have to get over to the hospital.

08:56.247 --> 08:58.977
I told them to beep me if
there was any news about my sergeant.

08:58.977 --> 09:00.255
What happened to him?

09:00.255 --> 09:01.842
She's having a baby.

09:01.842 --> 09:05.343
Oh well, hope it's a girl!

09:05.343 --> 09:06.664
Yeah, I'll tell Frasier you had to run.

09:06.664 --> 09:10.631
Thanks... listen, um, I never do this,

09:10.631 --> 09:17.217
but I would love to have a beer
or go to dinner sometime.

09:17.217 --> 09:18.352
With me?

09:18.352 --> 09:19.631
I don't want to put you on the spot.

09:19.631 --> 09:25.062
If you, uh, if you want to go out,
just give me a call.

09:25.062 --> 09:29.117
With me?

09:29.117 --> 09:30.708
You're the only one here.

09:30.708 --> 09:32.657
Here we are!  Three beers.

09:32.657 --> 09:36.886
Good news, there was a fly in one glass,
so these are free!

09:36.886 --> 09:38.231
I'm sorry, I just got beeped.

09:38.231 --> 09:39.903
Oh, that's too bad.

09:39.903 --> 09:42.326
Yeah, but it was nice to see you.

09:42.326 --> 09:44.158
Maybe I'll bump into you again here sometime.

09:44.158 --> 09:44.880
Oh, that'd be great.

09:44.880 --> 09:56.375
OK, bye.

09:58.646 --> 10:02.031
I'll have a grande half-caf latte,
with a whisper of cinnamon.

10:02.031 --> 10:05.951
And for my father, plain coffee.

10:05.951 --> 10:09.990
I cannot emphasize the word "plain" enough.

10:09.990 --> 10:12.551
No foam, no cinnamon, no exotic flavors.

10:12.551 --> 10:16.967
If it is not plain, I take no
responsibility for the consequences.

10:16.967 --> 10:19.135
How about a biscotti?

10:19.135 --> 10:19.775
All right.

10:19.775 --> 10:26.383
But when you bring it, call it a cookie.

10:26.383 --> 10:27.140
Hi, son.

10:27.140 --> 10:28.221
Hello, Dad.

10:28.221 --> 10:30.404
Uh, I want to thank you for meeting me like this.

10:30.404 --> 10:33.646
Well, my pleasure.

10:33.646 --> 10:38.732
So... what can I do you for?

10:38.732 --> 10:44.399
Well, I need some advice.

10:44.399 --> 10:45.442
That's why you asked me here?

10:45.442 --> 10:46.989
Yeah.

10:46.989 --> 10:48.960
You've never done this before!

10:48.960 --> 10:50.064
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.

10:50.064 --> 10:51.130
But anyway, you remember?

10:51.130 --> 10:52.687
Dad, I want you to know
I'm not only deeply touched,

10:52.687 --> 10:55.775
but I consider this a watershed
moment in our relationship!

10:55.775 --> 10:56.857
Great.  See, the thing is?

10:56.857 --> 10:58.880
All my life, it seems you've always turned to Frasier.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.084
"Frasier, Frasier, Frasier!"

11:00.084 --> 11:02.166
Niles, can I talk?!

11:02.166 --> 11:05.209
I'm listening.

11:05.209 --> 11:13.737
Here we are.  One latte, one coffee, and one "cookie."

11:13.737 --> 11:18.429
I think they call this thing a biscotti.

11:18.429 --> 11:25.475
No need to talk down to the man.  Off you go!

11:25.475 --> 11:29.803
Well, anyway, uh, you remember
the other night, Frasier's policewoman?

11:29.803 --> 11:31.125
Mmm-hmm.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.279
Well, we found her at the bar,

11:32.279 --> 11:38.048
and, uh, well, she came on to me.

11:38.048 --> 11:38.649
No.

11:38.649 --> 11:39.506
Yeah.

11:39.506 --> 11:40.142
You?

11:40.142 --> 11:42.191
Yeah.

11:42.191 --> 11:45.413
Was she drunk?

11:45.413 --> 11:48.061
Oh, I'm sorry, Dad, of course,
you're right, I'm sorry.

11:48.061 --> 11:51.636
Uh, what was Frasier's reaction?

11:51.636 --> 11:52.937
I haven't told him yet.

11:52.937 --> 11:54.370
Why not?

11:54.370 --> 11:55.304
I just can't.

11:55.304 --> 11:59.026
Can I?

11:59.026 --> 12:01.040
I know he's going to feel lousy.

12:01.040 --> 12:05.131
He finally meets a girl he likes,
and she's attracted to his old man.

12:05.131 --> 12:08.659
Hmm, that is quite a conundrum.

12:08.659 --> 12:10.954
I wonder if that's what's really bothering you.

12:10.954 --> 12:13.461
What do you mean?

12:13.461 --> 12:16.175
Maybe, underneath it all,
you're attracted to this woman and

12:16.175 --> 12:16.985
you want to go out with her.

12:16.985 --> 12:17.807
Oh, are you, nuts?

12:17.807 --> 12:20.883
That's sick!  That's disgusting!

12:20.883 --> 12:22.026
"it's just a theory."

12:22.026 --> 12:26.485
But for the sake of argument,
let's say you're right.

12:26.485 --> 12:29.182
Dad, you're allowed to be attracted to a woman.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.743
What kind of a father does a thing like that?

12:31.743 --> 12:34.576
Did you encourage her in any way?

12:34.576 --> 12:36.854
Well, I guess I was kind of charming.

12:36.854 --> 12:38.241
I mean, I didn't mean to be!

12:38.241 --> 12:41.905
It just sometimes leaks out.

12:41.905 --> 12:45.359
Well, what do you want to do?

12:45.359 --> 12:47.750
Well, most important I don't want to hurt Frasier.

12:47.750 --> 12:52.049
And secondly, I want to go out with Maureen.

12:52.049 --> 12:56.794
The order of that changes
depending on the time of day.

12:56.794 --> 12:59.710
Well, one possibility is, go on a date with her.

12:59.710 --> 13:01.632
If you feel there are sparks
between you and this woman,

13:01.632 --> 13:03.985
then tell Frasier.

13:03.985 --> 13:05.349
I don't want to lie to my son.

13:05.349 --> 13:06.204
You're not lying to him.

13:06.204 --> 13:07.945
You're delaying the truth to spare his feelings.

13:07.945 --> 13:11.459
If nothing happens, he need never know.

13:11.459 --> 13:13.422
Well, I guess it's worth a try.

13:13.422 --> 13:18.345
If Maureen and I hit it off,
then I'll tell him immediately.

13:18.345 --> 13:20.906
Or I can.  Really, I don't mind!

13:33.626 --> 13:35.120
Hi, Dad.

13:35.120 --> 13:37.381
Oh, Frasier!  You're still home.

13:37.381 --> 13:40.382
Yeah.  Where are you going?

13:40.382 --> 13:44.496
Just out.

13:44.496 --> 13:46.370
What are you gonna do?

13:46.370 --> 13:48.932
Nothing.

13:48.932 --> 13:52.056
When are you gonna be home?

13:52.056 --> 13:54.814
Later.

13:54.814 --> 13:56.543
Well, you put a dent in the car, young man,

13:56.543 --> 14:09.591
it's coming out of your allowance!

14:09.591 --> 14:10.962
I mean, I've got my pride, you know.

14:10.962 --> 14:13.780
So, I said to her, I said,
"Mrs. Crease, I'll do the cooking,

14:13.780 --> 14:18.496
I'll do the cleaning, but
I draw the line at creaming your feet!"

14:18.496 --> 14:21.523
Dear, hurry up!  "The Mambo Kings" is about to start!

14:21.523 --> 14:25.797
Oh, I wouldn't mind mamboing
with Antonio Banderas!

14:25.797 --> 14:28.799
All right, set out the goodies
and I'll go get the wine.

14:28.799 --> 14:31.911
Oh, and this time, Charlotte,
be careful with that chocolate!

14:31.911 --> 14:34.310
I had a hell of a time hiding the stain from His Nibs

14:34.310 --> 14:38.081
Oh, hello, Dr. Crane!

14:38.081 --> 14:40.253
Daphne.  Charlotte, Maggie.

14:40.253 --> 14:41.073
Dr. Crane.

14:41.073 --> 14:42.137
Please, sit down.

14:42.137 --> 14:44.305
I thought you were filling
in at the station tonight.

14:44.305 --> 14:53.282
Oh, I am.  But, uh, not for a couple of hours yet.

14:53.282 --> 14:57.254
Oh-ho, seems a shame to hang around here.

14:57.254 --> 15:01.652
I mean, I would have thought
you'd have taken an opportunity like this to,

15:01.652 --> 15:05.563
I don't know... go down to McGinty's?

15:05.563 --> 15:07.926
Oh, to see his new lady friend, you mean?

15:07.926 --> 15:13.132
Ah, well, I see I've been quite
the hot topic over the teapot.

15:13.132 --> 15:16.057
You know, I may have said
a thing or two in passing, but?

15:16.057 --> 15:17.797
I'd go for it, Dr. Crane!

15:17.797 --> 15:20.933
Yes, well, if you must know,
I was planning to go down there,

15:20.933 --> 15:22.584
but not for a couple of days yet.

15:22.584 --> 15:24.105
Well, I wouldn't wait too long.

15:24.105 --> 15:27.057
I mean, strike while the iron's hot,
that's what I always say!

15:27.057 --> 15:28.922
She's right.

15:28.922 --> 15:30.870
Well, women don't really like men
that are too overeager.

15:30.870 --> 15:32.230
Oh, nonsense.

15:32.230 --> 15:34.958
I mean, you know, it's one thing
if the man's some bounder

15:34.958 --> 15:39.281
git from the docks, but it's different
if the man's like you.

15:39.281 --> 15:40.669
Someone who's charming.

15:40.669 --> 15:41.877
And handsome.

15:41.877 --> 15:58.313
And knows lots and lots of words.

15:58.313 --> 16:02.438
Well, McGinty's is on my way to the station.

16:02.438 --> 16:05.987
I suppose I could just pop my head in.

16:05.987 --> 16:07.469
Thank you, ladies, for your support ?

16:07.469 --> 16:12.292
even if it was nakedly self-serving and insincere.

16:16.239 --> 16:17.905
So, they finally put my transfer through,

16:17.905 --> 16:21.282
and I'm moving out of Traffic and into Narcotics.

16:21.282 --> 16:23.914
Yeah, I'm gonna be working with,
uh, Bill Henderson at the 31st.

16:23.914 --> 16:25.898
Good for you.

16:25.898 --> 16:28.589
Yeah, I'm excited, although
I hear he can be pretty tough.

16:28.589 --> 16:32.434
Oh no.  I mean, he might seem
a little stiff and strait-laced,

16:32.434 --> 16:35.002
but once you get to know him he's
the greatest guy in the world.

16:35.002 --> 16:36.482
Yeah, he is pretty impressive.

16:36.482 --> 16:39.642
Oh yeah, smart, great sense of humor.

16:39.642 --> 16:42.155
No, you're gonna have a great time.

16:42.155 --> 16:44.899
Dad, I can't believe you're doing this!

16:44.899 --> 16:45.829
Frasier!

16:45.829 --> 16:47.728
Look, I was gonna tell you?

16:47.728 --> 16:50.079
Believe me, I did not put him up to this,

16:50.079 --> 16:53.249
though I think he's overselling me a little.

16:53.249 --> 16:54.990
I'm not the greatest guy in the world.

16:54.990 --> 16:57.573
Seattle, maybe.

16:57.573 --> 16:58.686
Am I missing something?

16:58.686 --> 16:59.643
Oh, I'm just joking.

16:59.643 --> 17:01.733
OK, Dad, thanks for warming her up for me.

17:01.733 --> 17:03.449
I can take over here.

17:03.449 --> 17:11.425
Martin?

17:11.425 --> 17:33.578
Frasier... Maureen and I are here on a date.

17:33.578 --> 17:35.204
I know you might think this is one of those wildly

17:35.204 --> 17:39.844
embarrassing moments where
I'm standing here with egg on my face.

17:39.844 --> 17:43.060
I assure you, I'm not as embarrassed
as you might assume

17:43.060 --> 17:45.326
I would be embarrassed.

17:45.326 --> 17:52.961
I'm not uncomfortable, so please,
don't you be uncomfortable either.

17:52.961 --> 17:54.713
Why don't I give you two a moment?

17:54.713 --> 17:58.576
Whatever!

17:58.576 --> 17:59.517
You asked her out?!

17:59.517 --> 18:01.767
No, that's not the way it happened.

18:01.767 --> 18:02.968
There's no use lying to me.

18:02.968 --> 18:04.721
I am at the lowest point I could possibly be,

18:04.721 --> 18:06.762
so please just tell me the truth!

18:06.762 --> 18:08.571
Maureen asked me out.

18:08.571 --> 18:14.470
Going down!

18:14.470 --> 18:17.086
It happened the other night
when you went to the bar to get drinks.

18:17.086 --> 18:20.538
You know, it just caught me off guard,
I didn't know how to handle it.

18:20.538 --> 18:22.408
So, Niles said I should?

18:22.408 --> 18:24.271
Niles?  Niles knows?

18:24.271 --> 18:26.359
Look, I'm sorry.

18:26.359 --> 18:27.669
It was supposed to be a one-time thing,

18:27.669 --> 18:29.564
just to see if there was something there,

18:29.564 --> 18:33.502
and if there wasn't, then you
didn't even need to know about it.

18:33.502 --> 18:36.281
Well, is there?  "Something there?"

18:36.281 --> 18:39.158
Oh, yeah.

18:39.158 --> 18:43.586
Well... it's not as if we were standing
side-by-side when she chose you.

18:43.586 --> 18:44.931
I was at the bar!

18:44.931 --> 18:48.380
If you'd gone to get the drinks,
things would have been different.

18:48.380 --> 18:50.242
I don't think so.

18:50.242 --> 18:51.503
Dad, I'm drowning here.

18:51.503 --> 18:54.033
Please, throw me a line!

18:54.033 --> 18:56.384
Look, uh, I'm gonna go tell her
this whole thing is a mistake?

18:56.384 --> 18:59.952
No, no, no, Dad!

18:59.952 --> 19:04.158
I'll be OK, really.

19:04.158 --> 19:08.614
Well... the old dog's  still got it in him, huh?

19:08.614 --> 19:11.099
Yeah.  But, really, how long can it last?

19:11.099 --> 19:14.051
I mean, she's got to come to her senses eventually?

19:14.051 --> 19:16.950
Oh no, Dad, Dad, don't sell yourself short.

19:16.950 --> 19:19.753
You've got a lot to offer.

19:19.753 --> 19:24.540
Well, I'd better head off to work.

19:24.540 --> 19:25.419
Goodnight, Dad.

19:25.419 --> 19:30.941
Goodnight, thanks.

19:30.941 --> 19:33.233
Damn!

19:38.503 --> 19:40.594
Uh-uh, OK, thanks.

19:40.594 --> 19:43.824
Frasier just came in the building,
so everybody hide and be quiet.

19:43.824 --> 19:45.771
Do you think he'll be surprised?

19:45.771 --> 19:47.435
Considering his birthday was yesterday?

19:47.435 --> 19:49.921
Yeah, I do, Elizabeth.

19:49.921 --> 19:52.988
Should we yell "surprise" or "happy birthday?"

19:52.988 --> 19:55.377
We've done this like five hundred times.

19:55.377 --> 19:57.214
And every time it's pretty much the same.

19:57.214 --> 19:59.008
We yell, the person pretends to be surprised,

19:59.008 --> 20:01.248
and we stuff ourselves with cake.

20:01.248 --> 20:03.184
I just wanted it to be perfect.

20:03.184 --> 20:08.211
And that is what makes you so special to us.

20:08.211 --> 20:16.287
Now get under the console!

20:16.287 --> 20:17.287
Hi, Frasier!

20:17.287 --> 20:18.698
How you doing?

20:18.698 --> 20:20.384
Oh, just wonderful.

20:20.384 --> 20:23.920
Forty-three is off to a rousing start.

20:23.920 --> 20:25.584
Remember that policewoman I was interested in?

20:25.584 --> 20:26.304
Yeah?

20:26.304 --> 20:30.318
Well, she's dating my father!

20:30.318 --> 20:31.087
Your father?

20:31.087 --> 20:31.910
Mmm-hmm!

20:31.910 --> 20:33.013
Well, never mind that.

20:33.013 --> 20:35.045
I know just what will take your mind off of it.

20:35.045 --> 20:36.632
I've got something really funny in my booth.

20:36.632 --> 20:39.152
I spent the last hour wandering
the streets, trying to take

20:39.152 --> 20:40.937
assessment of my life.

20:40.937 --> 20:41.882
Do you know how long it's been since

20:41.882 --> 20:43.824
I've slept with a woman?  Seven months!

20:43.824 --> 20:44.486
Frasier?

20:44.486 --> 20:48.392
All right, nine months!

20:48.392 --> 20:50.421
I really don't think we should
talk about that right now!

20:50.421 --> 20:53.799
Oh sure, fine, you can't spare me
five minutes to talk about

20:53.799 --> 20:56.645
my problems, when every day I drop
what I'm doing to be your

20:56.645 --> 20:57.711
personal Wailing Wall.

20:57.711 --> 20:59.032
"Frasier, he stopped calling me."

20:59.032 --> 21:00.522
"Frasier, he wants his key back."

21:00.522 --> 21:05.133
"Frasier, his girlfriend is having me followed!"

21:05.133 --> 21:09.024
I'm sorry.

21:09.024 --> 21:11.835
So nine months, huh?

21:11.835 --> 21:14.745
Nine long, long, months.

21:14.745 --> 21:15.590
Oh...

21:15.590 --> 21:16.535
You know who that woman was?

21:16.535 --> 21:17.252
Who?

21:17.252 --> 21:18.208
Edna, from Accounting.

21:18.208 --> 21:20.887
No...

21:20.887 --> 21:23.271
The next day, she dumped me!

21:23.271 --> 21:25.153
I tell you, Roz, I'm starting to
feel nostalgic for that summer

21:25.153 --> 21:30.475
in my twenties when I was impotent!

21:30.475 --> 21:31.782
The only comfort I have now is knowing that

21:31.782 --> 21:34.083
my humiliation can't possibly get any worse!

21:34.083 --> 21:43.220
SURPRISE!

21:43.220 --> 21:51.036
Hi, Edna.
