WEBVTT

00:35.166 --> 00:36.166
I can see from down there

00:36.250 --> 00:37.625
that you have not shaved.

00:37.709 --> 00:38.875
Why is that?

00:38.959 --> 00:40.458
Why are you
staring at me?

00:40.542 --> 00:41.709
Do you think I am attractive?

00:41.792 --> 00:44.917
You better tuck in
that bottom lip.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.125
(male #1)
'Double time
down to the quad.'

00:47.208 --> 00:48.500
Is that understood?

00:48.583 --> 00:51.667
(all)
Sir, yes, sir!

00:51.750 --> 00:52.750
Go!

02:49.417 --> 02:53.959
(John)
'Caretaker relocating graves
came across a bastard coffin.'

02:54.041 --> 02:55.250
(Scotty)
'No headstone.'

02:55.333 --> 02:56.959
(Lilly)
Perfect place to bury a body.

02:57.041 --> 03:00.000
(John)
CSU found a duffel bag
and personal items

03:00.083 --> 03:03.959
buried underneath
the box. Idiot bag.

03:04.041 --> 03:08.166
Buries a book of knowledge to
be
worn by knobs at all times.

03:08.250 --> 03:09.291
Knobs?

03:09.375 --> 03:11.083
First-year cadets,
military school.

03:11.166 --> 03:12.959
Shave their heads
to look like knobs.

03:13.041 --> 03:14.667
Well, this knob got a name?

03:14.750 --> 03:16.458
ID says Kate Butler.

03:16.542 --> 03:18.875
Parents reported her missing
three years ago from--

03:18.959 --> 03:21.000
Pennsylvania Military Institute.

03:21.083 --> 03:22.583
I remember this girl.

03:22.667 --> 03:26.083
One of the first females
admitted to PMI.

03:26.166 --> 03:27.375
It took a lot of guts.

03:27.458 --> 03:29.625
PMI. That's in what,
Bucks county?

03:29.709 --> 03:30.917
(Scotty)
How she wind up
out here?

03:31.000 --> 03:32.625
(Lilly)
Weekend leave in the city?

03:32.709 --> 03:36.375
(John)
Except this box is
a military footlocker.

03:36.458 --> 03:38.000
Issued by the school.

03:38.083 --> 03:40.125
Fractured skull,
possible blunt-force trauma.

03:40.208 --> 03:42.250
(Scotty)
'Could be our
murder weapon right here.'

03:42.333 --> 03:44.959
Seven-pound hand weight,
with her initials on it.

03:45.041 --> 03:47.792
We'll have those
examined
for blood or hair.

03:47.875 --> 03:50.041
Corroded laptop, clothes.

03:50.125 --> 03:51.959
Made it look like
she ran away.

03:52.041 --> 03:54.625
Got her in there
without cutting up the body.

03:54.709 --> 03:56.625
Had to be before rigor set in.

03:56.709 --> 04:00.959
So she's murdered on campus,
stuffed in a footlocker.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.625
Driven all the way out here,
30 miles away.

04:03.709 --> 04:06.500
Hopin' it would never get
tied back to the school.

04:08.542 --> 04:09.834
It just did.

04:44.250 --> 04:45.542
(Lilly)
'Pennsylvania
Military Institute.'

04:45.625 --> 04:48.166
Now, all male for 162 years.

04:48.250 --> 04:50.959
Well, mid 90's, justice
department forced almost every

04:51.041 --> 04:54.834
'state military academy to
admit
qualified female applicants.'

04:54.917 --> 04:58.291
They even Valley Forge
and the Citadel are co-ed now.

04:58.375 --> 05:01.208
PMI was one of the last
holdouts
till four years ago.

05:01.291 --> 05:02.875
Can't believe
this is still an issue.

05:02.959 --> 05:06.041
Male institutions dragging
their feet to admit women?

05:06.125 --> 05:07.208
Yeah, glad that's behind us.

05:07.291 --> 05:08.375
Next thing you know, they'll..

05:08.458 --> 05:10.208
start letting 'em be detectives.

05:10.291 --> 05:12.166
(Will)
'Kate Butler was
one of two female cadets'

05:12.250 --> 05:14.875
who entered PMI
in the fall of '05.

05:14.959 --> 05:16.291
'Missing clothes, laptop.'

05:16.375 --> 05:17.750
Assigned figured she ran away.

05:17.834 --> 05:20.041
Well, the body changes all that.

05:20.125 --> 05:21.166
What happened to the other girl?

05:21.250 --> 05:22.542
Uh, Courtney Gaines.

05:22.625 --> 05:24.417
Went into the
infirmary
after the first day

05:24.500 --> 05:25.709
gone within a week.

05:25.792 --> 05:27.375
Butler almost made it
to thanksgiving.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.417
School reported her missing
when she didn't show up

05:29.500 --> 05:30.875
for chapel on Sunday morning.

05:30.959 --> 05:32.542
Campus computer system

05:32.625 --> 05:34.166
had her swiping
out her ID card

05:34.250 --> 05:36.291
at the front gate
night before, 8:26
p.m.

05:36.375 --> 05:38.250
Well, ID was found
with the body.

05:38.333 --> 05:40.750
Possible her killer
swiped her card on the way out?

05:40.834 --> 05:42.750
Used the footlocker
to get the body off campus

05:42.834 --> 05:44.041
but he still needed a car.

05:44.125 --> 05:45.417
I'll look into parking permits.

05:45.500 --> 05:46.917
(Nick)
'Victim's father's
downstairs'

05:47.000 --> 05:48.583
'just coming
from the morgue.'

05:48.667 --> 05:50.583
'Mother's on
her way in now.'

05:50.667 --> 05:52.750
Separated when
they lost their daughter.

05:52.834 --> 05:56.417
Autopsy report made me
confirm blunt-force trauma.

05:56.500 --> 06:00.166
(Scotty)
'Kate's hand weight
matched the contusion.'

06:00.250 --> 06:01.500
Could have been killed
in her own room.

06:01.583 --> 06:04.125
Had a stress fracture
in her pelvis.

06:04.208 --> 06:06.750
Undetermined cause.
Possible sexual assault?

06:06.834 --> 06:09.667
I'll check the PMI
infirmary records.

06:14.667 --> 06:16.583
Latest from the crime scene.

06:16.667 --> 06:17.959
Thanks. How you doing?

06:18.041 --> 06:20.625
Billy moved out this morning.

06:20.709 --> 06:23.625
Finally asked him for a divorce.

06:23.709 --> 06:25.000
I didn't know you
were gonna do that.

06:25.083 --> 06:28.000
Yeah, I know, right?

06:28.083 --> 06:29.125
Time to move on.

06:29.208 --> 06:30.458
Yeah.

06:32.709 --> 06:33.959
So, um, see you around?

06:34.041 --> 06:35.750
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

06:39.417 --> 06:42.792
Still have her room
the way it was.

06:42.875 --> 06:46.291
Every time the phone rang,
a little part of me..

06:46.375 --> 06:49.333
Hoping it was her, you know?

06:49.417 --> 06:54.125
We're thinking she may have
been
killed on campus, Mrs. Butler.

06:54.208 --> 06:56.208
Have you informed
her father yet?

06:56.291 --> 06:58.208
He's handling
the identification.

06:58.291 --> 07:00.333
Nothing he loved more
than that school.

07:00.417 --> 07:04.166
Lot of folks have a problem
with her attending PMI?

07:04.250 --> 07:06.083
Including her own father.

07:06.166 --> 07:08.250
He never wanted Kate to
go there in the first place.

07:08.333 --> 07:09.917
His alma mater.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.375
She was just
as stubborn as he was.

07:13.458 --> 07:15.000
Force of her own.

07:15.083 --> 07:16.917
Never even told us
she was applying

07:17.000 --> 07:18.166
until after she was accepted.

07:18.250 --> 07:21.500
Mr. Butler was concerned
for her safety?

07:21.583 --> 07:23.083
Concerned for his daughter?

07:24.583 --> 07:27.250
You'd have to ask him.

07:27.333 --> 07:30.333
(male #2)
'Graduated in '78
before I got my commission.'

07:31.917 --> 07:36.583
I went to PMI because
that's where my father went.

07:36.667 --> 07:38.667
His father before him.

07:38.750 --> 07:42.417
Footlocker we found her body
in,
was from PMI, Mr. Butler.

07:42.500 --> 07:46.041
(Lilly)
'I think that's how the
killer
got her body off campus.'

07:54.458 --> 07:56.875
I don't want Charlotte
to ever see those pictures.

07:59.959 --> 08:01.208
So, how she holding up?

08:01.291 --> 08:03.542
Well, she said you never
wanted Kate to go to PMI

08:03.625 --> 08:07.542
that you had a difficult
relationship with your
daughter.

08:07.625 --> 08:09.458
I knew what she was
gonna be up against.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.208
She did it to prove me wrong.

08:15.125 --> 08:16.417
Her mother blamed me
for what happened.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.792
Why would she blame you?

08:18.875 --> 08:20.333
She didn't tell you?

08:20.417 --> 08:23.208
Kate would have
done anything for her father.

08:23.291 --> 08:25.125
But you don't defy Hank Butler.

08:25.208 --> 08:26.417
She'd made up her mind.

08:26.500 --> 08:30.041
I always sided with my husband.

08:30.125 --> 08:31.875
But there comes a time
when a child needs

08:31.959 --> 08:33.458
more than just tough love.

08:39.291 --> 08:40.333
(Charlotte)
'Hank?'

08:41.834 --> 08:43.917
Your daughter's
going off to college.

08:45.583 --> 08:47.291
(Charlotte)
'Do you intend
to say goodbye to her?'

08:48.917 --> 08:51.208
Daddy?

08:51.291 --> 08:52.834
I know you don't
want me to do this.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.709
I just want you to know..

09:04.792 --> 09:05.834
...I'm not gonna let you down.

09:10.333 --> 09:11.750
Goodbye, daddy.

09:13.250 --> 09:15.625
If you can't hack it,
don't bother coming home.

09:25.625 --> 09:27.959
(John)
'Do you think that was..'

09:28.041 --> 09:31.333
...an ultimatum
or a...a means of motivation?

09:31.417 --> 09:33.542
Either way, I always thought

09:33.625 --> 09:35.792
it was the reason
my baby never came back.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.166
Blamed your husband for that.

09:37.250 --> 09:39.667
Kate didn't need
any more people against her.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.333
This is all
the hate mail she got

09:45.417 --> 09:47.208
before she even
set foot on campus.

09:47.291 --> 09:49.041
Did you show those
to the police before?

09:49.125 --> 09:50.458
They said
they looked into it.

09:50.542 --> 09:52.667
They told us that she ran away.

09:55.083 --> 09:57.333
I guess that's
not true now, is it?

10:00.792 --> 10:03.500
Did you talk
to Commandant Murillo?

10:03.583 --> 10:04.834
We will.

10:06.709 --> 10:09.250
Thanks for coming in,
Mr. Butler.

10:09.333 --> 10:10.375
Sure.

10:18.709 --> 10:20.125
You better find
the son of a bitch

10:20.208 --> 10:21.542
who did this before I do.

10:44.417 --> 10:46.417
(male #3)
'When Cadet Butler
didn't return to campus'

10:46.500 --> 10:48.375
'we assumed that she'd
eventually show up'

10:48.458 --> 10:50.083
on her parents' doorstep.

10:50.166 --> 10:51.333
A new information indicates

10:51.417 --> 10:53.875
she may have
been killed on campus.

10:53.959 --> 10:55.250
I find that
hard to
believe.

10:55.333 --> 10:56.542
First
year
is
difficult

10:56.625 --> 10:57.959
'but we have
standards of safety'

10:58.041 --> 11:00.125
'for all cadets,
male or female.'

11:00.208 --> 11:03.333
But there are no female cadets
presently enrolled?

11:03.417 --> 11:06.208
Yes, well, it's a rather
limited applicant pool.

11:06.291 --> 11:07.458
Maybe if you put a woman

11:07.542 --> 11:09.333
on your brochure
see what happens.

11:09.417 --> 11:11.875
We're gonna need access to all
school records and grounds.

11:11.959 --> 11:13.417
I've been ordered
to give you whatever you
need.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.375
Cadet Gardner here
will show you to
Moe.

11:15.458 --> 11:16.834
He's my operations officer.

11:16.917 --> 11:18.667
Now, if you'll excuse me.

11:20.375 --> 11:21.667
(male #4)
'Attention on the quad!'

11:21.750 --> 11:23.542
(Lilly)
'All hail the commandant.'

11:23.625 --> 11:25.583
Saw a bumper sticker on the lot.

11:25.667 --> 11:27.250
God, country and PMI.

11:27.333 --> 11:30.417
Gotta figure the commandant's
next on that list.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.458
Thought they were supposed
to look straight ahead.

11:32.542 --> 11:34.542
Sir, not every
day
a pretty blonde

11:34.625 --> 11:36.542
walks across campus, sir.

11:40.792 --> 11:42.375
<i>(Moe)</i>
<i>'Course I remember</i>
<i>Kate Butler.</i>

11:42.458 --> 11:44.583
It was my job to implement
the necessary changes

11:44.667 --> 11:47.083
to accommodate
female cadets on campus.

11:47.166 --> 11:50.458
I don't think these were the
accommodations she had in mind.

11:50.542 --> 11:53.583
Got a way to track
that footlocker, Moe?

11:53.667 --> 11:54.959
Please.

11:55.041 --> 11:57.375
Two in every room,
but, uh, we don't assign
them

11:57.458 --> 11:58.709
to any particular cadet.

11:58.792 --> 12:01.250
One goes missing, who
requisitions a replacement?

12:01.333 --> 12:02.291
No inventory.

12:02.375 --> 12:03.583
We just replace
them as they

12:03.667 --> 12:05.041
fall apart at
the end of the year.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.458
'Must be, uh,
thousands of them.'

12:06.542 --> 12:07.709
It sounds odd for a place

12:07.792 --> 12:09.500
that keeps such
meticulous
records.

12:09.583 --> 12:11.625
(Lilly)
'Like the computer log
you supplied back in '05.'

12:11.709 --> 12:14.291
Showed the exact time
Kate left campus.

12:14.375 --> 12:16.125
It goes into a
computer
any time a cadet

12:16.208 --> 12:19.166
swipes their ID at the
front
gate, on or off campus.

12:19.250 --> 12:21.125
We're gonna need a
list
of registered cars

12:21.208 --> 12:22.625
and parking
permits
that year.

12:22.709 --> 12:24.625
Infirmary records,
any injuries

12:24.709 --> 12:25.625
Kate may have incurred.

12:25.709 --> 12:26.834
Whatever you need.

12:26.917 --> 12:28.875
- Lawrence.
- Yes, major.

12:28.959 --> 12:31.709
You know if Kate had any
problems with another cadet?

12:31.792 --> 12:34.333
(Moe)
'Every fourth class cadet
has a rough go of it.'

12:34.417 --> 12:37.083
More a function of being a
knob.
It's not personal.

12:37.166 --> 12:38.959
What about the function
of being a girl?

12:39.041 --> 12:40.166
Wouldn't that get personal?

12:40.250 --> 12:42.792
Well, she never
filed a complaint.

12:42.875 --> 12:45.417
Look, I'd be lying to you
to say there wasn't resentment

12:45.500 --> 12:46.709
among some of the cadets.

12:46.792 --> 12:48.792
Why? She get
special consideration?

12:48.875 --> 12:50.291
It didn't matter much.

12:50.375 --> 12:52.375
That girl was determined
to be one of the guys.

12:55.750 --> 12:58.083
Major, it is still too long.

12:58.166 --> 12:59.750
How short do you
want it, commandant?

12:59.834 --> 13:01.000
I have no idea.

13:01.083 --> 13:02.834
(Murillo)
'She still looks
like a girl.'

13:02.917 --> 13:05.542
(Moe)
'With all due respect,
sir, she is a girl.'

13:05.625 --> 13:07.333
And we don't have
a female grooming standard.

13:07.417 --> 13:10.041
- Courtney. Don't.
- Don't what?

13:10.125 --> 13:12.083
Well, keep cutting
till we find one.

13:14.500 --> 13:17.375
I'm gonna be a knob,
I might as well look like
one.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.166
Still cutting
your hair doesn't mean

13:56.250 --> 13:57.750
'you can cut
the mustard here at PMI.'

13:57.834 --> 14:00.417
This program is just too
demanding for most women.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.083
Kate have a boyfriend on campus?

14:02.166 --> 14:03.417
No, ma'am.

14:03.500 --> 14:05.250
We instituted
a non-fraternization policy

14:05.333 --> 14:06.583
'the year
women were admitted.'

14:06.667 --> 14:08.500
Yeah, 'cause those always work.

14:08.583 --> 14:11.041
Damned if you do,
damned if you don't,
detective.

14:11.125 --> 14:12.417
We'd like to see her room.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.291
Lawrence, show them
the barracks.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.417
Yes, sir.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.917
(Scotty)
'"A cadet shall not
lie, cheat, or steal'

14:19.000 --> 14:20.917
nor shall he tolerate
those who do."

14:21.000 --> 14:22.208
Hmm, honor code.

14:22.291 --> 14:23.834
Noticed they got one
in every building.

14:23.917 --> 14:25.208
Single sanction
policy, ma'am.

14:25.291 --> 14:27.208
One violation
gets you drummed out.

14:28.583 --> 14:30.417
Pretty strict code
for most mortals.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.291
That's why on the eighth day,
God created PMI.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.792
This the only dorm room
with a lock on the door?

14:36.875 --> 14:39.458
Yes, sir, first one
installed
in school history.

14:39.542 --> 14:41.333
Along with
a special latrine..

14:41.417 --> 14:43.625
...bathroom for women
down the hall.

14:43.709 --> 14:45.959
(Lawrence)
Room's been unoccupied
since Cadet Butler

14:46.041 --> 14:47.667
and the other girl left.

14:47.750 --> 14:50.333
The other girl?
Courtney Gaines?

14:50.417 --> 14:51.959
(Lawrence)
'Yes, ma'am,
non-hacker.'

14:52.041 --> 14:54.625
Cadet Butler only shared
a room the first week.

14:54.709 --> 14:56.834
(Scotty)
'Tell the commandant
this is now a crime scene.'

14:56.917 --> 14:58.208
Yes, sir.

14:58.291 --> 15:00.542
I think it's time
we talk to Courtney Gaines.

15:03.125 --> 15:05.083
I transferred to Bryn Mawr
my freshman year

15:05.166 --> 15:06.542
to major in women's studies.

15:06.625 --> 15:09.667
Quite a contrast, going from
an all-male military academy

15:09.750 --> 15:10.959
'to a women's college,
Courtney.'

15:11.041 --> 15:13.041
I'm writing my senior thesis
on the merits

15:13.125 --> 15:14.625
of single-sex education.

15:14.709 --> 15:15.792
Which one?

15:15.875 --> 15:17.458
Women's colleges only graduate

15:17.542 --> 15:19.083
four percent of the country's

15:19.166 --> 15:21.542
female students'
but they produce 25 percent

15:21.625 --> 15:24.875
of the female board members
of Fortune 500 companies

15:24.959 --> 15:26.834
Fifty percent
of the women in congress.

15:26.917 --> 15:29.125
I know where
my daughter's
going.

15:29.208 --> 15:30.834
How did you get along with Kate?

15:30.917 --> 15:32.625
(Courtney)
'Oh, she was a great girl,
tried to help me.'

15:32.709 --> 15:35.625
I thought going to a school
like PMI would be empowering.

15:35.709 --> 15:38.125
Instead I spent half
my time in the infirmary.

15:38.208 --> 15:39.959
- What happened?
- Hell Week.

15:40.041 --> 15:44.083
Marching, pushups,
more marching.

15:44.166 --> 15:45.917
Suffered a stress fracture
in my pelvis.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.417
- Kate had the same injury.
- Women's legs are shorter.

15:48.500 --> 15:51.000
And so, we have to take longer
strides just to keep up.

15:51.083 --> 15:53.417
But the physical abuse
was nothing compared

15:53.500 --> 15:55.000
to the psychological assault.

15:55.083 --> 15:57.083
Maybe 'cause Kate's
father went there

15:57.166 --> 15:59.375
she was more prepared.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.875
She knew how to survive.

16:00.959 --> 16:03.959
Actually, neither one of you
survived the school.

16:04.041 --> 16:05.250
But at least
you're still sitting here.

16:05.333 --> 16:06.792
What do you mean?

16:06.875 --> 16:10.041
- She was found in a cemetery.
- 'Oh, my God.'

16:10.125 --> 16:11.709
(Nick)
'Anyone in particular
you can remember'

16:11.792 --> 16:14.000
gunning for her, Courtney?

16:14.083 --> 16:15.375
Yeah, I do.

16:16.792 --> 16:19.000
He hated both of us on sight.

16:19.083 --> 16:21.125
I'll never forget his face.

16:22.917 --> 16:27.333
In what year was my beloved
institution founded?

16:27.417 --> 16:30.583
- Fat body?
- Sir, Eighteen forty..

16:30.667 --> 16:32.291
Uh, some-something, sir. I..

16:32.375 --> 16:36.291
Cadet Chucklehead has just
desecrated the very ground

16:36.375 --> 16:38.959
upon which you
worthless knobs stand.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.667
(male #1)
'For that, you owe me
20 more pushups.'

16:41.750 --> 16:45.375
Eat floor, knobs!
Exercise!

16:45.458 --> 16:50.709
What we obtain too cheap,
we esteem too lightly.

16:51.834 --> 16:53.250
Come on. Get up.
You can do it.

16:53.333 --> 16:54.750
- 'You can hack it!'
- I can't.

16:54.834 --> 16:56.375
(Courtney)
'I can't do it.'

16:56.458 --> 16:58.667
(male #1)
'This ain't yoga class
downward dog!'

16:58.750 --> 17:02.834
Get your ass out of the air
and do a man's pushup!

17:02.917 --> 17:04.250
'You gonna spend
another night'

17:04.333 --> 17:06.333
'crying in the infirmary,
Cadet Useless?'

17:07.583 --> 17:10.083
That's what I thought.

17:10.166 --> 17:11.500
- You all right?
- Shut up.

17:11.583 --> 17:13.250
Don't even look at me.
Before he comes over here and--

17:13.333 --> 17:16.792
'Eight-Ball, did you just blow
chunks on my fine quadrangle?'

17:16.875 --> 17:18.583
Sir, yes, sir!
Sorry, sir.

17:18.667 --> 17:20.250
'Are you suggesting
that my mess hall'

17:20.333 --> 17:22.834
'doesn't quite measure up
to your mama's home cooking?'

17:22.917 --> 17:24.125
Do you need a bib?

17:24.208 --> 17:25.291
Sir, no, sir!

17:25.375 --> 17:26.375
'How about you, Sinead?'

17:26.458 --> 17:27.834
You wanna give me some tears?

17:27.917 --> 17:29.208
Make me feel sorry for you?

17:29.291 --> 17:31.875
- Sir, no, sir!
- 'You see this ring?'

17:31.959 --> 17:34.834
'You think I busted my ass
for three long years'

17:34.917 --> 17:36.166
just to see 'em
give it away to a bunch

17:36.250 --> 17:38.959
of sports bra-wearing
pantywaists?

17:39.041 --> 17:41.834
Only way you're getting
one is through me..

17:41.917 --> 17:43.250
...and that ain't gonna happen.

17:49.542 --> 17:51.875
Sergeant James Addison.

17:55.125 --> 17:56.750
Still have nightmares
about that guy.

17:56.834 --> 17:58.250
Made it clear it was you or him.

17:58.333 --> 18:02.500
The day I walked out,
every guy in the place
cheered.

18:03.792 --> 18:05.667
Kate stayed.
God knows why.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.000
Did Addison threaten
you personally?

18:07.083 --> 18:10.000
He visited me in the infirmary.

18:10.083 --> 18:13.291
Told me to leave now and walk
out through the front gates..

18:15.417 --> 18:17.709
...or be carried out in a box.

18:27.041 --> 18:28.834
First Lieutenant James Addison?

18:30.709 --> 18:31.792
I help you?

18:31.875 --> 18:34.250
Detectives Rush, Valens.
Philly Homicide.

18:34.333 --> 18:35.500
You're here about Cadet Butler.

18:35.583 --> 18:37.166
Yeah, word travels fast.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.166
Graduated two years ago.

18:38.250 --> 18:40.333
You still hanging around?

18:40.417 --> 18:42.500
Grad program, engineering.

18:42.583 --> 18:44.375
Finished my first tour
in Afghanistan.

18:44.458 --> 18:46.500
'Get free room as
resident hall director.'

18:46.583 --> 18:47.875
How well did you know Kate?

18:47.959 --> 18:49.709
I was part of
the Echo Company cadre.

18:49.792 --> 18:52.375
Saw her every day during Hell
Week. Not much after that.

18:52.458 --> 18:54.834
I heard you took
special pride in racking
knobs

18:54.917 --> 18:56.417
especially the female kind.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.375
(Lilly)
'Made it your mission
to run them off.'

18:58.458 --> 18:59.709
Guess it worked.

18:59.792 --> 19:00.875
I didn't treat
the women different

19:00.959 --> 19:01.875
than any other knob.

19:01.959 --> 19:03.125
Courtney Gaines says otherwise.

19:03.208 --> 19:04.542
Hell yeah,
I tried to run 'em out.

19:04.625 --> 19:06.083
I tried to run 'em all out.
It was my job.

19:06.166 --> 19:08.542
It was break down the
individual, build up the
group?

19:08.625 --> 19:10.542
Whiny maggots call it hazing.

19:10.625 --> 19:13.375
I call it natural selection.

19:13.458 --> 19:15.834
But then, Courtney
was no Kate Butler.

19:15.917 --> 19:17.333
What was different
about Cadet Butler?

19:17.417 --> 19:18.959
She understood what it took

19:19.041 --> 19:21.250
to earn the respect
of her peers.

19:26.750 --> 19:29.125
How'd Butler rank first
in the two mile run?

19:29.208 --> 19:30.542
(male #5)
'She finished sixth.'

19:30.625 --> 19:32.834
It's called gender norming,
chucklehead.

19:32.917 --> 19:35.625
Women automatically get two
minutes shaved off their
time.

19:35.709 --> 19:37.458
One for each knocker?

19:37.542 --> 19:39.083
You're up first,
you gaudy smack!

19:39.166 --> 19:40.917
Get on that bar
and give me ten pull-ups!

19:41.000 --> 19:43.750
Sir, yes, sir.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.750
You have got to be
kidding me, fish!

19:45.834 --> 19:48.625
'Only girls and gumps
do the flexed arm hang.'

19:48.709 --> 19:49.917
Hold it right there, gomer.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.959
- Get up there, Butler.
- Sir, yes, sir.

19:53.709 --> 19:56.417
Let's see if you girls
can hang for a full minute.

20:03.166 --> 20:06.250
Let the girl beat you?
Come on!

20:12.542 --> 20:14.959
You are a no go
at this station, Stewart!

20:15.041 --> 20:17.166
Get off my bar,
you fat tub of goo!

20:20.375 --> 20:22.625
- 'Get back in formation.'
- Sir, yes, sir.

20:29.917 --> 20:32.208
Butler knew that as long
as there was gender norming

20:32.291 --> 20:33.625
she'd never be equal.

20:33.709 --> 20:35.125
'Had to respect the effort.'

20:35.208 --> 20:36.709
Even if Rhianna never
lived it down.

20:36.792 --> 20:37.667
Rhianna?

20:37.750 --> 20:38.750
That's what they called Ryan

20:38.834 --> 20:40.458
after Kate smoked him.

20:40.542 --> 20:41.625
'Drove the kid nuts.'

20:41.709 --> 20:43.125
Where's this Rhianna now?

20:43.208 --> 20:44.166
First class cadet.

20:44.250 --> 20:48.000
Senior.
His folks live upstate.

20:48.083 --> 20:50.709
Went home to visit. He's due
back tomorrow before first
call.

20:50.792 --> 20:52.333
Is that a sign out sheet?

20:52.417 --> 20:56.166
Yeah, cadets have to sign in and
out of the barracks on weekends.

20:56.250 --> 20:57.667
You know, I don't mind
standing the duty.

20:57.750 --> 20:59.166
I basically get paid to study.

20:59.250 --> 21:01.208
This different from the ID
swipe
at the front gate?

21:01.291 --> 21:03.792
The ID swipe's to get
on and off campus.

21:03.875 --> 21:05.625
Barracks log
is for curfew
purposes.

21:05.709 --> 21:07.834
School keep track of these?

21:07.917 --> 21:09.542
(James)
Collected every
Sunday morning

21:09.625 --> 21:11.083
filed over in the main office.

21:11.166 --> 21:13.709
Remember where you were the
Saturday night Kate
disappeared?

21:13.792 --> 21:15.166
Saturday night?

21:15.250 --> 21:17.083
I would've been out drinking
with the guys in Echo.

21:17.166 --> 21:18.291
It's
mandatory
around here.

21:18.375 --> 21:19.375
Good.

21:19.458 --> 21:20.917
Then you'll remember
their names.

21:23.625 --> 21:26.834
Hey, I have Kate's medical
records from the PMI
infirmary.

21:26.917 --> 21:30.500
Usual bruises and blisters
except the 18 stitches

21:30.583 --> 21:32.291
she needed for
a gash in her hand

21:32.375 --> 21:34.709
two weeks before
she disappeared.

21:34.792 --> 21:37.125
Hmm. Little rough
for regular PT.

21:37.208 --> 21:41.000
Told the doctor on
duty
she broke a bottle.

21:41.083 --> 21:42.667
I'm thinking
possible defensive
wounds.

21:42.750 --> 21:45.333
It makes you wonder why the hell
she wanted to go to this school.

21:45.417 --> 21:46.917
Get anything
from
the hate mail?

21:47.000 --> 21:50.375
Uh, yeah, a lot of folks
with serious issues.

21:50.458 --> 21:53.709
Here's one blowhard,
threatened to have Kate

21:53.792 --> 21:55.959
drawn and quartered
for taking the spot

21:56.041 --> 21:58.333
of more qualified
young men.

21:58.417 --> 22:02.083
Hmm, postmark's from one of
those office postage machines.

22:02.166 --> 22:03.417
And worth tracking.

22:03.500 --> 22:04.875
Nut job number two

22:04.959 --> 22:06.250
thinks Kate going to PMI

22:06.333 --> 22:08.458
is a breach
of the Garden of Eden.

22:10.792 --> 22:13.542
"He placed on the east side
of the Garden of Eden

22:13.625 --> 22:16.250
"angels and a flaming sword

22:16.333 --> 22:17.750
"flashing back and forth

22:17.834 --> 22:19.875
to guard the way
to the tree of life."

22:19.959 --> 22:22.375
Well, there's six of them
with the same sword business.

22:22.458 --> 22:23.917
All sent out on a Saturday.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.583
It could be a cadet
off-campus
on open weekends?

22:26.667 --> 22:29.417
They hate mail on Saturday,
chapel on Sunday.

22:29.500 --> 22:31.291
These guys are unbelievable.

22:31.375 --> 22:33.125
I believe it.

22:33.208 --> 22:35.250
You ain't tellin' me this
kind of stuff happened to you

22:35.333 --> 22:36.583
back in the day?

22:36.667 --> 22:38.667
First female in homicide.

22:38.750 --> 22:41.417
Remember Walter Harris?

22:41.500 --> 22:42.959
Detective retired in '02?

22:43.041 --> 22:44.417
Sure, was the Walrus.

22:44.500 --> 22:46.417
He's a legend
with the practical jokes.

22:46.500 --> 22:47.583
Oh, he was funny, alright.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.458
Had a joke for me every day.

22:49.542 --> 22:54.709
PMS, uh, my social
life,
my ass, you name it.

22:54.792 --> 22:55.750
Are you kidding?

22:55.834 --> 22:56.917
No, I rolled with it

22:57.041 --> 22:58.250
'cause that's what
you do, right?

22:58.333 --> 23:00.500
Even rolled with it
when he put a
centerfold

23:00.583 --> 23:02.625
'with my face on it
on the fridge.'

23:02.709 --> 23:05.291
Till this one night
I'm down in the Bottom

23:05.375 --> 23:07.166
picking up a 6'4" meth head.

23:07.250 --> 23:11.166
I turn around,
I got no backup.

23:11.250 --> 23:12.667
Walter hung you out to dry.

23:13.959 --> 23:15.750
You report his ass?

23:15.834 --> 23:17.792
But I figured it'd
only get worse.

23:19.333 --> 23:21.166
And at least I was 29.

23:22.875 --> 23:24.208
Kate was only 18.

23:24.291 --> 23:25.792
I'll hit PMI
in the morning

23:25.875 --> 23:27.291
'talk to Ryan Stewart.'

23:27.375 --> 23:30.500
See if Rhianna ever
lived
his nickname down.

23:34.041 --> 23:36.000
- Night, doll face.
- Night.

23:50.083 --> 23:51.834
Philly Homicide.
Rise and shine, Rhianna.

23:51.917 --> 23:53.709
- What the hell is this?
- Know you got a busy schedule.

23:53.792 --> 23:55.792
Figured we'd talk to you
before first call.

23:55.875 --> 23:57.917
- Remember Kate Butler?
- Kate's dead?

23:58.000 --> 23:59.500
Found her in a footlocker.

23:59.583 --> 24:01.208
You reported yours
missing knob year.

24:01.291 --> 24:03.959
I reported all
my furniture missing, sir.

24:04.041 --> 24:05.208
They used to
put it out on the quad

24:05.291 --> 24:06.834
while I was asleep
sometimes with me in it.

24:06.917 --> 24:08.041
Where were you the
night
she disappeared?

24:08.125 --> 24:09.542
Don't know. My room.
Where I always was.

24:09.625 --> 24:12.000
Rhianna. Pretty nickname.
Cadets still call you that?

24:12.083 --> 24:13.792
No, not if they want
to keep their teeth, ma'am.

24:13.875 --> 24:16.500
Kate stuck you with that name.
Dusted you off good.

24:16.583 --> 24:18.834
Lit a fire under my ass.
I bench over 300 pounds now.

24:18.917 --> 24:20.458
Forgive and
forget?
How sweet.

24:20.542 --> 24:21.875
Yeah, I busted my hump
to make it this far.

24:21.959 --> 24:23.625
I'm gonna graduate
on time with a ring.

24:23.709 --> 24:24.959
(Lilly)
'Congratulations.'

24:25.041 --> 24:26.500
Kate's pushing up daisies.

24:28.083 --> 24:29.750
Look, it wasn't,
it wasn't the students

24:29.834 --> 24:31.041
that Kate Butler
had to worry about.

24:31.125 --> 24:33.208
Who was it?

24:33.291 --> 24:34.917
Kate was a member
of the color guard.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.709
Most cadets, it was
a time to shine.

24:36.792 --> 24:38.375
But Kate dreaded it.

24:53.375 --> 24:57.000
Hell you think you are
performing with the color
guard?

24:57.083 --> 24:58.625
You aren't fit to
touch that flag.

24:58.709 --> 25:00.208
I'm just trying
to do my job, sir.

25:00.291 --> 25:02.583
Yeah, well, it's bad enough
a guy's denied a place

25:02.667 --> 25:05.875
'they let some
bitch like you in.'

25:05.959 --> 25:09.166
(male #6)
'Forward march.'

25:09.250 --> 25:12.000
You're a disgrace
to the long blue
line

25:12.083 --> 25:15.083
of men who wear this ring!

25:15.166 --> 25:16.417
You hear me?

25:19.375 --> 25:21.959
The guy did the same thing
to her every single game.

25:22.041 --> 25:23.583
There was nothing
she could do about it.

25:23.667 --> 25:25.250
She'd get in trouble
if she fell out of
formation.

25:25.333 --> 25:26.333
Yeah, no one
had her back.

25:26.417 --> 25:28.000
No one knew what to do.

25:28.083 --> 25:30.208
I mean, that type of thing
didn't happen with the guys.

25:30.291 --> 25:33.250
(Lilly)
'Loudmouth with the ring,
he alumni?'

25:33.333 --> 25:35.250
Yes, ma'am, Jeb something.

25:35.333 --> 25:37.208
Drunk still comes to every game.

25:37.291 --> 25:38.583
(Kat)
'Jebediah Buford.'

25:38.667 --> 25:39.917
PMI class of '82.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.375
Works on the tenth floor.

25:41.458 --> 25:43.917
Genius who sent
the anonymous hate mail
letter

25:44.041 --> 25:45.583
using his office
postage machine.

25:45.667 --> 25:46.792
Just talked to Moe.

25:46.875 --> 25:48.166
"Qualified young men"
he was ranting about

25:48.250 --> 25:49.709
he's talking
about his own son.

25:50.625 --> 25:52.125
Letter from PMI admissions.

25:52.208 --> 25:55.709
Brandon Buford, waitlisted
the same year Kate was accepted.

25:55.792 --> 25:58.208
Kid never got in.
Legacy or not.

25:58.291 --> 26:00.542
Check out the Buford's
home address on the top.

26:00.625 --> 26:01.959
(Kat)
'19128.'

26:02.041 --> 26:03.208
Roxborough.

26:03.291 --> 26:04.667
Four blocks
from the cemetery

26:04.750 --> 26:05.834
where Kate's body was found.

26:12.834 --> 26:15.417
How long did you work at the
Army Corps of Engineers, Jeb?

26:15.500 --> 26:17.417
Been serving my nation
and the public my whole life.

26:17.500 --> 26:18.792
When you're not
getting loaded

26:18.875 --> 26:21.291
'at PMI football games
threatening girls?'

26:21.375 --> 26:22.834
'"Better lock
your door at night.'

26:22.917 --> 26:25.959
"With 2,500 bloodhounds
and only one bitch

26:26.041 --> 26:27.709
you won't make it
to Thanksgiving."

26:27.792 --> 26:29.166
What the hell
is all this about?

26:29.250 --> 26:31.417
Your meter number
is the same as your office

26:31.500 --> 26:33.750
mailing machine, Einstein.

26:33.834 --> 26:36.291
No other PMI grads
in your department.

26:36.375 --> 26:38.542
Certainly
not your son Brandon.

26:38.625 --> 26:39.834
Couldn't get anywhere
near the place

26:39.917 --> 26:42.166
with a 2.2
from Roman Catholic.

26:42.250 --> 26:44.041
Brandon was a good kid.

26:44.125 --> 26:45.583
PMI would have
straightened him out.

26:45.667 --> 26:47.166
Woulda, coulda, shoulda.

26:47.250 --> 26:48.375
How many DUIs he got now?

26:48.458 --> 26:50.125
My son was a legacy.

26:50.208 --> 26:52.500
That used to mean
something there.

26:52.583 --> 26:55.125
You wanted
that girl gone.

26:55.208 --> 26:56.959
Hate mail
is a state offense, Jeb.

26:57.041 --> 26:59.250
So I wrote one
stinking letter. Big deal.

26:59.333 --> 27:01.125
But why you hassling
me over a girl

27:01.208 --> 27:02.667
who dropped out
three years ago?

27:02.750 --> 27:04.250
She popped back up.

27:04.333 --> 27:08.250
Roxborough Cemetery,
few blocks from your house.

27:10.125 --> 27:11.875
- I want a lawyer.
- 'Why?'

27:11.959 --> 27:13.375
Got something to hide?

27:13.458 --> 27:15.500
Class of '82 had
a tailgating party on campus

27:15.583 --> 27:18.333
same day Kate disappeared,
November 15, 2005.

27:18.417 --> 27:21.709
You were there. We're gonna give
the jury opportunity and motive.

27:21.792 --> 27:24.250
Look, I didn't hurt
that girl, alright?

27:24.333 --> 27:26.458
'I don't know how
she wound up in that grave.'

27:26.542 --> 27:29.917
You wanna find out,
you talk to her boyfriend.

27:41.542 --> 27:42.709
I'm sure her multicultural

27:42.792 --> 27:44.125
boyfriend knows
what happened to her.

27:44.208 --> 27:46.709
"Multicultural"
boyfriend
got a name?

27:46.792 --> 27:48.709
Don't know.
Not a lot of 'em at PMI.

27:48.792 --> 27:50.250
'Shouldn't be
too hard to find out.'

27:50.333 --> 27:54.125
What did you do after
the class of '82 tailgate?

27:54.208 --> 27:56.917
Cross burning?

27:57.000 --> 27:59.083
I went to dinner with
the same group of alumni

27:59.166 --> 28:01.208
that I always do.

28:01.291 --> 28:02.542
You can check.

28:04.333 --> 28:07.417
Count on it,
Jebediah.

28:07.500 --> 28:11.000
Keith Henderson only
black cadet in Echo Company.

28:11.083 --> 28:15.125
Kid never spoke to Plumstead
Township Police in '05.

28:15.208 --> 28:16.792
Hmm, he better have
a good excuse

28:16.875 --> 28:19.417
for not coming forward
when she went missing.

28:19.500 --> 28:21.667
I'll get his records,
see what I can dig up.

28:21.750 --> 28:24.625
Oh, did you, uh, did you
check on Jeb's alibi?

28:24.709 --> 28:27.458
Oh, be taking my time
getting to that.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.917
Ever get an
award
for penmanship?

28:32.000 --> 28:33.041
Guessing you think
I should have?

28:33.125 --> 28:34.625
This "P"
looks
like an "R."

28:34.709 --> 28:37.583
Could have unraveled your,
uh, PMI warrant big time.

28:37.667 --> 28:39.709
Came all the way down here
to rail on my cursive?

28:39.792 --> 28:42.291
Actually, I was wondering what
you were up to Friday night.

28:42.375 --> 28:45.834
I, um, got tickets
to The Heartless Bastards.

28:45.917 --> 28:47.375
The who?

28:47.458 --> 28:48.542
Yeah, I wish it were The Who

28:48.625 --> 28:51.709
but the venue's
a little small for them.

28:51.792 --> 28:54.250
A-are you asking me
out on a date?

28:54.333 --> 28:55.417
So what do you say?

28:58.041 --> 29:00.667
You gonna feed me first?

29:00.750 --> 29:02.208
I can do that.

29:02.291 --> 29:03.959
Then I say yes.

29:08.834 --> 29:11.375
(female #1)
'I don't get it, Scotty.'

29:11.458 --> 29:14.083
I'm divorcing my husband.
That's not good news?

29:15.750 --> 29:17.500
Maybe if you had told me
six months ago.

29:17.583 --> 29:18.750
Look, I don't know
what to tell you--

29:18.834 --> 29:20.166
You need time.
Yeah, you told me.

29:20.250 --> 29:21.375
All this back and forth

29:21.458 --> 29:24.583
seems like we could both
use a coolin' off.

29:24.667 --> 29:26.750
Is that what that
was last month?

29:26.834 --> 29:28.834
- Cooling off?
- Will got shot.

29:28.917 --> 29:31.875
It-it was wrong,
me coming to you.

29:33.417 --> 29:34.709
So that's it?
Just like that?

29:34.792 --> 29:37.625
I don't know what you
want
from me, Frankie.

29:37.709 --> 29:40.208
For the record, I think
you're making a mistake.

29:41.625 --> 29:43.250
A really bad one.

29:55.959 --> 29:57.917
- At ease, soldier.
- Can't leave my post, sir.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.041
Put down the weapon, Keith.

29:59.125 --> 30:00.834
(Lilly)
'Making us nervous.'

30:02.750 --> 30:06.083
Talk about your relationship
with Kate Butler. Knob year.

30:06.166 --> 30:08.083
She was in Echo Company with
me,
ma'am. That's about it.

30:08.166 --> 30:10.875
See, now you're
violating our honor code.

30:10.959 --> 30:12.333
'Got an eyewitness
puts you and her'

30:12.417 --> 30:16.166
getting cozy at the Danboro
Grounds Coffee Shop.

30:16.250 --> 30:17.291
Have to stay at my post, sir.

30:17.375 --> 30:18.542
Your post can wait.

30:18.625 --> 30:20.250
Maybe your graduation
next month, too.

30:20.333 --> 30:23.500
Introduce you to another long
blue line down at the station.

30:33.583 --> 30:35.583
They called us the Odd Squad.

30:36.750 --> 30:40.041
Echo had me, the chick,
and a Jew.

30:40.125 --> 30:41.583
No one could figure out
why we were here.

30:41.667 --> 30:42.792
What's that
got to do with you

30:42.875 --> 30:44.083
giving Kate
the high hard one?

30:44.166 --> 30:46.041
We weren't
sleeping
together, sir.

30:46.125 --> 30:48.250
I needed a tutor,
and she needed a
friend.

30:50.959 --> 30:53.667
I-I don't know, Kate.

30:53.750 --> 30:56.542
Uh, infinite sequences
look like Chinese to me.

30:56.625 --> 30:59.750
I'll take dim sum
over antiderivatives any
day.

31:00.583 --> 31:01.875
Oh, my God.

31:01.959 --> 31:03.500
- What?
- You just smiled.

31:03.583 --> 31:05.458
What are you talking
about?
I smile all the time.

31:05.542 --> 31:07.083
Not since I've known you.

31:07.166 --> 31:09.417
Is your face gonna
fall off or something?

31:09.500 --> 31:11.375
Nope, still works.

31:12.375 --> 31:13.667
Why you so serious, Kate?

31:14.625 --> 31:15.917
Why do you think?

31:16.000 --> 31:18.625
I gotta be
a hundred times more Teflon

31:18.709 --> 31:20.208
than the rest of the guys.

31:21.458 --> 31:24.500
Put up a front, just like you.

31:24.583 --> 31:25.792
Uh, front.

31:25.875 --> 31:27.250
I really thought
you were that tough.

31:27.333 --> 31:29.625
Well, if I let
my guard down, I'll be
dead.

31:30.959 --> 31:33.166
Why are you doing this, Kate?

31:33.250 --> 31:34.792
Hmm? What's the matter?

31:34.875 --> 31:36.250
Your father wanted a boy?

31:39.875 --> 31:41.959
I were a boy,
he'd be bragging

31:42.041 --> 31:43.417
about me to everyone he knows.

31:43.500 --> 31:47.208
Um, it's just, we want
to get that ring

31:47.291 --> 31:49.125
we gotta get back
to this calculus, right?

31:49.208 --> 31:50.875
- Chinese, you mean.
- Yeah.

31:53.875 --> 31:55.625
Kate was good people
once you got to know her.

31:55.709 --> 31:57.583
Touching story, Keith.

31:57.667 --> 31:59.709
- That your, uh, signature?
- Yes, sir.

31:59.792 --> 32:03.166
It's a barracks sign out log
from the day Kate went AWOL.

32:03.250 --> 32:05.375
'You signed out at 7:17.'

32:05.458 --> 32:06.375
Same time as her.

32:06.458 --> 32:08.417
You came back.
She never did.

32:08.500 --> 32:10.333
There's gotta be
a mistake, ma'am.

32:10.417 --> 32:12.291
I was on tours
every weekend that month.

32:12.375 --> 32:13.959
Tours. That's punishment, right?

32:14.041 --> 32:16.166
- 'What was that for?'
- Don't remember.

32:16.250 --> 32:17.583
'Something to do with
that demerit you got'

32:17.667 --> 32:18.709
for getting caught
in the ladies' room?

32:18.792 --> 32:20.834
November 1st, 2005.

32:20.917 --> 32:22.125
Two weeks before
she's murdered.

32:22.208 --> 32:23.625
That was a misunderstanding.

32:23.709 --> 32:24.875
Same night Kate shows up
in the infirmary

32:24.959 --> 32:26.333
with her hand cut up
like sushi.

32:26.417 --> 32:27.834
- She get that injury from
you?
- What? No, I-I--

32:27.917 --> 32:29.417
What the hell were you doing

32:29.500 --> 32:32.083
skulking around
that ladies'
latrine?

32:32.166 --> 32:33.625
'Right here, Keith.'

32:33.709 --> 32:35.166
Anytime.

32:35.250 --> 32:37.333
I did go in that latrine.

32:37.417 --> 32:40.166
'Cause I was trying to help.

32:50.750 --> 32:52.792
(Keith)
'Kate?'

32:57.125 --> 32:58.166
(Keith)
'Kate? Kate?'

33:02.792 --> 33:05.375
God! Kate!

33:05.458 --> 33:07.417
Kate.
Wake up.

33:07.500 --> 33:08.959
Wake up.

33:09.041 --> 33:10.667
- Keith?
- You're bleeding.

33:10.750 --> 33:12.208
- 'Ow.'
- Your hand is..

33:12.291 --> 33:13.792
- Ow!
- Jeez.

33:15.417 --> 33:17.500
- Put pressure on it.
- Ow!

33:20.959 --> 33:22.250
(Keith)
'What happened to you?'

33:23.917 --> 33:25.750
Kate, who was it
that did this to you?

33:25.834 --> 33:27.166
Just get me back to my room.

33:27.250 --> 33:29.208
- Kate..
- Please, Keith, please.

33:35.208 --> 33:37.250
I knew the cadets hated her.

33:37.333 --> 33:38.875
Just didn't know
how much until then.

33:38.959 --> 33:41.458
- You ever find out who did it?
- She wouldn't tell me, ma'am.

33:41.542 --> 33:43.083
And I never got
a look at his face.

33:43.166 --> 33:44.750
- You take her to the
infirmary?
- Yes, sir.

33:44.834 --> 33:46.917
Couldn't get
the bleeding to stop.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.500
When I went back
to get my calculus book

33:48.583 --> 33:50.083
that's when they
caught me in the bathroom.

33:50.166 --> 33:51.792
Reason you had to do tours.

33:55.667 --> 33:58.041
Knew I should have
kept my mouth shut.

33:58.125 --> 34:01.250
All this time I thought
they just ran her out.

34:01.333 --> 34:02.583
Who did you talk to, Keith?

34:02.667 --> 34:05.208
I was in the Odd Squad, too.

34:05.291 --> 34:07.458
I thought they were gonna
come after me next.

34:07.542 --> 34:09.458
There's no incident report
filed with Echo Company.

34:09.542 --> 34:11.667
I didn't go through
the chain of command.

34:11.750 --> 34:15.166
The honor code is only as
strong
as the cadets who uphold it.

34:16.041 --> 34:17.667
I went straight to the top.

34:17.750 --> 34:19.041
Commandant Murillo?

34:30.959 --> 34:33.458
Thanks for coming in,
Mr. Murillo.

34:33.542 --> 34:35.333
It's Colonel Murillo.

34:35.417 --> 34:37.500
Oh, I think I've earned that.

34:37.583 --> 34:38.875
You can have a seat.

34:41.083 --> 34:42.542
You have a problem
with Cadet Butler

34:42.625 --> 34:45.291
enrolling at PMI, colonel?

34:45.375 --> 34:47.417
What's this all about,
lieutenant?

34:47.500 --> 34:50.542
I believe the
detective
asked you a
question.

34:50.625 --> 34:52.625
What I have a problem
with is irrelevant

34:52.709 --> 34:54.917
in view of what the courts
have decided now, isn't it?

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
It isn't when
you allow a student

34:56.083 --> 34:57.542
to be assaulted on campus.

34:57.625 --> 34:59.500
That's a bit presumptuous.
Am I on the stand here?

34:59.583 --> 35:01.041
You knew Kate was attacked

35:01.125 --> 35:03.792
you should have stopped it
from going further.

35:03.875 --> 35:05.083
I knew no such thing.

35:05.166 --> 35:06.792
We have a cadet
who witnessed it.

35:06.875 --> 35:08.250
Told you what he saw.

35:08.333 --> 35:11.125
What Cadet Keith Henderson
told me was hearsay.

35:11.208 --> 35:13.583
I chose to go directly
to the horse's mouth.

35:17.417 --> 35:20.458
Sir, Cadet Butler
reporting as ordered, sir.

35:20.542 --> 35:22.166
At ease.

35:22.250 --> 35:24.417
I want to talk to you about an
incident that may have occurred

35:24.500 --> 35:26.208
in the women's latrine
last night.

35:26.291 --> 35:27.542
Sir?

35:27.625 --> 35:29.083
I've been told that there
was an altercation

35:29.166 --> 35:30.709
between you and another cadet.
Is that true?

35:30.792 --> 35:34.792
To my knowledge, sir,
there was no incident.

35:37.542 --> 35:39.542
Cadet Butler, are you
aware of the honor code?

35:39.625 --> 35:41.375
Yes, sir.

35:41.458 --> 35:44.792
"A cadet shall not
lie, cheat, or steal

35:44.875 --> 35:48.000
nor shall he tolerate
those who do."

35:48.083 --> 35:52.333
Now, did anything occur in
the women's latrine last
night?

35:55.834 --> 35:57.375
Nothing happened, sir.

36:00.458 --> 36:03.333
- Dismissed.
- Sir, yes, sir.

36:06.959 --> 36:07.959
<i>(Lilly)</i>
<i>Well, that's it?</i>

36:08.041 --> 36:09.417
You just let her go?

36:09.500 --> 36:11.250
What the hell
would you have me do?

36:11.333 --> 36:14.542
The honor code is
the backbone of the
institute.

36:14.625 --> 36:17.750
If she said it
didn't happen, it didn't.

36:17.834 --> 36:19.083
(Lilly)
'She was trying
to suck it up'

36:19.166 --> 36:21.458
to fit in with
the male cadets.

36:21.542 --> 36:25.083
Well, then she made
her choice, didn't she?

36:25.166 --> 36:27.083
- You were head of the school.
- I still am.

36:27.166 --> 36:28.333
That hasn't
stopped you from

36:28.417 --> 36:29.542
trying to tell me
how to do my job.

36:29.625 --> 36:31.000
Maybe if you did it better.

36:32.875 --> 36:35.792
I don't care how many pull-ups
Kate Butler could do.

36:37.041 --> 36:38.500
She was never gonna
be one of the boys.

36:38.583 --> 36:41.250
Her anatomy prevented that.
Plain and simple.

36:41.333 --> 36:43.417
You don't give a rat's ass
what happened to her, do you?

36:43.500 --> 36:45.041
Any help I would have
given her directly

36:45.125 --> 36:47.041
would have just made
the situation worse.

36:47.125 --> 36:48.083
What do you mean, directly?

36:48.166 --> 36:49.125
I assigned an upperclassman

36:49.208 --> 36:50.667
to keep an eye on her.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.583
The same as I'm sure there
was somebody who looked out

36:52.667 --> 36:54.500
your

36:55.625 --> 36:57.667
Woman with a badge
intimidate you?

36:59.500 --> 37:01.542
Who was the upperclassman
you asked

37:01.625 --> 37:02.583
'to look after Kate?'

37:02.667 --> 37:04.125
A first sergeant, Echo Company.

37:04.208 --> 37:08.583
He would order her to his room
every Sunday for shine detail.

37:08.667 --> 37:10.041
Cadet James Addison?

37:10.125 --> 37:11.166
Uh-huh.

37:12.166 --> 37:13.667
Put the fox in the henhouse.

37:13.750 --> 37:16.458
Are we through here,
lieutenant?

37:18.709 --> 37:20.750
I choose to spend
my Saturday evenings

37:20.834 --> 37:22.375
kicking back with a Cohiba.

37:23.542 --> 37:26.417
I apologize if the phallic
implications

37:26.500 --> 37:28.875
of that offend you, officer.

37:28.959 --> 37:30.667
It's detective.

37:30.750 --> 37:32.208
And I've absolutely earned it.

38:02.583 --> 38:06.709
A lot of work goes into
keeping
everything clean, polished.

38:06.792 --> 38:08.375
How can I help you, detective?

38:08.458 --> 38:11.709
Made it sound like you hardly
knew Kate last time we talked.

38:12.917 --> 38:14.792
James Frederick Addison.

38:14.875 --> 38:17.041
Commandant's list
every semester.

38:17.125 --> 38:20.709
I can see why he chose
you
to watch over her.

38:20.792 --> 38:22.250
Shine detail, right?

38:22.333 --> 38:24.041
Every Sunday when
she came to your room?

38:24.125 --> 38:25.500
Colonel Murillo
told you about that.

38:25.583 --> 38:26.875
Wondering why you didn't.

38:26.959 --> 38:28.792
'Kate was attacked
one of those Sundays'

38:28.875 --> 38:30.208
two weeks
before she disappeared.

38:30.291 --> 38:32.291
Would have been after
she left your room.

38:33.667 --> 38:35.041
That just a coincidence?

38:37.291 --> 38:39.125
You're right
about my perfect record.

38:40.458 --> 38:42.709
I never failed
at a thing in my life.

38:43.792 --> 38:45.750
Until I met Kate.

38:47.959 --> 38:50.333
You gonna take
all day with that?

38:50.417 --> 38:51.875
Sir, I'll try
to speed it up, sir.

38:56.500 --> 38:57.917
'Brasso.'

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Bring some back when you
go home for Thanksgiving.

39:00.083 --> 39:01.500
Thank you, sir.

39:04.291 --> 39:06.000
- What's wrong?
- Sir, nothing's wrong, sir.

39:06.083 --> 39:07.500
Look, enough
with the sir sandwiches.

39:07.583 --> 39:09.083
- What happened to your hand?
- It's fine.

39:09.166 --> 39:10.583
Let me see. Come here.

39:19.125 --> 39:20.667
'They stitch this up
at the infirmary?'

39:20.750 --> 39:22.917
It's not a big deal. It's just,
some of the polish got in it--

39:23.000 --> 39:26.917
- How'd this happen to you?
- PT, I think. Not really
sure.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.166
Three years of PT
I never seen

39:28.250 --> 39:29.667
someone's hand
sliced like that.

39:29.750 --> 39:32.166
Now, two parallel cuts,
what's that?

39:32.250 --> 39:34.417
- It's a saber, isn't it?
- I couldn't say, Mr.
Addison.

39:34.500 --> 39:35.959
'Look, why do you
think I make you come'

39:36.041 --> 39:37.500
'to my room every damn Sunday?'

39:37.583 --> 39:39.834
So we can talk, so that
you have someone to turn to.

39:41.500 --> 39:42.750
Look at me.

39:43.709 --> 39:45.166
Now's the time, Kate.

39:48.375 --> 39:49.583
I know.

39:59.834 --> 40:01.542
Hello?

40:04.125 --> 40:06.542
Sir, request
permission
to get a towel, sir!

40:06.625 --> 40:08.291
Why do you need a towel, knob?

40:08.375 --> 40:10.250
You ashamed of your nakedness?

40:13.542 --> 40:14.500
'Answer me, knob!'

40:14.583 --> 40:16.500
You hiding from
the sight of God?

40:17.625 --> 40:19.583
Sir, yes, sir!

40:39.208 --> 40:40.875
Who was it?

40:40.959 --> 40:43.500
- Come on, Kate.
- It was just racking.

40:43.583 --> 40:45.500
Knobs are always getting
racked in the showers.

40:45.583 --> 40:46.875
That wasn't racking.

40:46.959 --> 40:48.667
That was assault.

40:50.375 --> 40:52.000
Look, no guy would
tolerate what he did to you

40:52.083 --> 40:54.166
so you tell me who it was
so I can go kick his ass.

40:54.250 --> 40:56.750
I got to fight my own battles.

41:02.667 --> 41:05.333
Then take care of it yourself..

41:05.417 --> 41:06.625
...or leave.

41:09.375 --> 41:10.792
You're the first, Kate.

41:10.875 --> 41:12.625
They're all going
to be watching you.

41:20.625 --> 41:22.834
I was supposed to protect her.

41:24.542 --> 41:26.041
All cadets carry a saber?

41:26.125 --> 41:27.375
Only upperclassmen

41:27.458 --> 41:29.375
select members
of the regimental honor guard.

41:29.458 --> 41:30.667
'Operations should have a list.'

41:30.750 --> 41:33.041
What'd you think
when she disappeared?

41:33.125 --> 41:35.625
I wasn't surprised.

41:35.709 --> 41:39.083
I thought she just
finally had enough and left.

41:43.834 --> 41:45.041
Detective..

41:46.291 --> 41:48.917
...find the person who hurt her.

43:17.250 --> 43:18.625
And on the eighth day..

43:18.709 --> 43:19.917
From the sight of God!

43:20.000 --> 43:22.166
God created PMI.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.458
Come on, Scotty.
Pick up.
