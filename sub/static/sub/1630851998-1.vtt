WEBVTT

00:20.754 --> 00:23.891
- That'll do.

00:29.197 --> 00:31.365
Good job, kid.
- Thank you.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.334
- All right.

00:33.934 --> 00:35.903
Here you go.

00:39.907 --> 00:41.609
You know where to go?
- Yes, sir.

00:41.609 --> 00:43.344
- Get to it.

00:47.848 --> 00:49.650
- This is never what I wanted.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.619
Never where I thought I'd be.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.922
But then I'd never been
anywhere else.

00:56.290 --> 00:59.393
A little further,
past that tree.

00:59.793 --> 01:02.596
Even when they sent me away,

01:02.596 --> 01:04.632
they just sent me
right back here.

01:27.121 --> 01:29.457
- Every member of my family
fights this fight

01:29.457 --> 01:30.891
in one way or another.

01:30.891 --> 01:34.162
And so does every family
who calls Kingstown home.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.665
So do a lot of families
who will never call it home,

01:37.665 --> 01:39.900
but they live here anyway.

01:39.900 --> 01:42.603
Waiting.
Always waiting.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.738
- You drop somethin'?

01:45.173 --> 01:48.509
- Now it's up to me to keep
the rats in the cage content.

01:49.943 --> 01:53.181
And the keepers
from becoming rats, themselves.

02:05.092 --> 02:06.960
- This is a company town

02:06.960 --> 02:09.697
and the business
is incarceration.

02:09.697 --> 02:12.833
Seven prisons
in a 10-mile radius.

02:12.833 --> 02:16.937
20,000 lost souls
with no hope, no future.

02:18.472 --> 02:22.276
And I'm their link to a world
that doesn't want them.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.512
I'm the life raft.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.616
I'm the mayor of Kingstown.

03:33.781 --> 03:36.083
- Now he's got all these
fucking guards hangin' out

03:36.083 --> 03:38.552
around his cell like a bunch
of fuckin' vultures.

03:38.552 --> 03:41.221
I told you last week
to get him fuckin' transferred.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.624
- Do I look like
the warden to you?

03:43.624 --> 03:45.225
He hit a fuckin' guard.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.094
- So help me, if any
of these bastards punks my kid-

03:47.094 --> 03:49.096
- You'll what?

03:49.096 --> 03:51.332
What are you gonna do, Walter?

03:51.765 --> 03:53.200
Huh?
Just 'cause you pay us,

03:53.200 --> 03:54.902
you think you can
talk to him like that?

03:54.902 --> 03:56.537
Is that it?

03:56.537 --> 03:58.539
Who the fuck do ya think
you're talkin' to?

04:00.608 --> 04:03.611
- The mayor.
- Yeah, you're fuckin' right.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.145
- I'm sorry.

04:05.145 --> 04:06.880
- Look, we had your kid
in protection, right?

04:06.880 --> 04:09.116
But he's got a big fuckin' mouth
and not much common sense,

04:09.116 --> 04:10.150
so what do you want?

04:10.150 --> 04:11.585
- He's in Ad Seg.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.086
Believe me, that's
the safest place he can be.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.456
Your kid fractured
that guard's jaw.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.224
But when they
throw the book at him,

04:17.224 --> 04:19.360
they don't want some
beat-to-shit 17-year-old

04:19.360 --> 04:22.129
in front of that judge,
so, he's fine for now.

04:22.129 --> 04:24.064
But he's gotta understand
and you've gotta understand,

04:24.064 --> 04:26.133
he's gettin' another five years
on that sentence.

04:26.133 --> 04:27.501
And he's gotta come to grips
with the fact

04:27.501 --> 04:29.036
that his only protection
is with the whites,

04:29.036 --> 04:30.671
and he's gonna
have to play ball to get it.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.239
And that means
he keeps his mouth shut

04:32.239 --> 04:34.274
and he does
what he's supposed to do.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.043
Because if he doesn't,
he's gonna end up

04:36.043 --> 04:38.011
somebody's girl
for the next decade.

04:38.011 --> 04:40.047
Be sure to
make that clear to him.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.483
- Sorry. He's my son.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.251
- Well, maybe next time
don't have him cookin' up meth

04:44.251 --> 04:47.621
in the Caraway campground.
How 'bout that?

04:47.621 --> 04:48.889
- Look, tell you what.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.123
You tell him to rope a sheet.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.359
If it looks like
they're gonna punk him,

04:51.359 --> 04:53.160
you have him noose up
before bed check.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.395
They'll put him
on suicide watch.

04:54.395 --> 04:57.097
It'll keep him
on the warden's radar.

04:57.931 --> 05:00.233
- Okay.
- Let's go.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.510
Jackass.

05:10.243 --> 05:11.379
We got a meet
at the Carriage House.

05:11.379 --> 05:13.146
You wanna bring this up?

05:13.146 --> 05:14.582
- That kid's gotten
all the fuckin' help

05:14.582 --> 05:16.083
we're gonna give him.
- Good.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.254
- Yep?
- Is there anyone out there

05:21.254 --> 05:22.890
with somethin'
I gotta hear right now?

05:22.890 --> 05:24.392
- No more than usual.
- Good.

05:24.392 --> 05:26.894
Then we're gonna
be back in an hour.

05:27.227 --> 05:30.531
- Oh wait, um,
remember Milo Center?

05:30.531 --> 05:32.065
His wife's here.

05:32.065 --> 05:34.835
- What does she want?
- Wouldn't tell me.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.704
- All right.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.207
You go on,
I'll see what this is.

05:40.207 --> 05:41.475
- You sure?

05:41.475 --> 05:43.844
- Yeah, if she's here
Milo sent her.

05:44.277 --> 05:46.246
- Okay.

05:56.156 --> 05:58.225
- Vera.
- Mitch.

05:58.225 --> 06:02.463
- How's Milo?
- Good. Ya know, counting.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.633
- It's a little early for that.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.435
- He's an optimist.

06:08.436 --> 06:11.772
- Well, tell me.
What can I do for him?

06:11.772 --> 06:14.274
- He needs something moved.
Could you close that?

06:17.177 --> 06:18.512
- No one can hear us out there.

06:18.512 --> 06:21.482
- I don't mind the smoke.
Please.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.527
- All right.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.529
- I leave for Estonia
tomorrow night

06:35.529 --> 06:38.799
and I must take it with me.
- It?

06:38.799 --> 06:40.801
Well, I gotta know
what I'm pickin' up.

06:40.801 --> 06:43.270
- From that thing.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.372
You know.

06:45.806 --> 06:49.342
- All of it?
- He said 10,000 for you.

06:51.779 --> 06:54.281
- This is a little outside
of what we do.

06:54.281 --> 06:56.349
I'm gonna have to hear
from Milo.

06:56.349 --> 06:58.085
Make sure that you're not
cookin' this up yourself.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.252
No offense.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.622
- He said
he could call after 3:00.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.891
- Have you got the where
and all that?

07:11.231 --> 07:13.300
Oh, a map.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.635
Is there gonna be
an X on the ground?

07:14.635 --> 07:16.970
Or maybe he has
a GPS coordinate, or-

07:16.970 --> 07:19.439
- Milo said no electronics.

07:19.439 --> 07:23.376
He would like you to make a copy
and I keep this one.

07:42.963 --> 07:46.600
- Thank you.
This is far.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.569
- County took the land.

07:48.569 --> 07:51.204
They will auction it off
next month.

07:51.204 --> 07:54.842
- Is there anyone out there?
- Milo said no.

07:55.375 --> 07:57.845
- All right.
We'll get it tonight.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.613
- Thank you.

07:59.613 --> 08:02.750
So tomorrow?

08:05.118 --> 08:06.987
Thanks, Mitch.

08:16.864 --> 08:20.000
- Damn, there's some fine-ass
women in this motherfucker.

08:35.482 --> 08:38.451
- This place, 20,000 inmates

08:38.451 --> 08:41.254
and 40,000 people
to babysit them,

08:41.254 --> 08:44.725
feed them, teach them.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.827
And when they get out,
employ them

08:46.827 --> 08:50.731
or convince them to leave
'cause this place is full.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.304
- Oh, hi honey.
- Any for me?

08:57.304 --> 08:59.907
- Big booth.
- Okay, thanks.

09:01.141 --> 09:02.409
- I'm not takin'
this shit any more.

09:02.409 --> 09:04.077
You show up
and do your fuckin' job.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.512
- Hey.
- Hey man, what's up?

09:05.512 --> 09:07.815
- How are ya?
- Good to see ya buddy.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.549
- I need coffee.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.985
Thanks, I'm dyin' here.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.488
Thank you.

09:15.488 --> 09:18.225
I saw um, I saw your ex
the other day.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.760
- Oh f--
If there was any justice,

09:19.760 --> 09:22.162
she was ridin' the brass pole
at the Elephant, please tell me.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.396
- Nah, man,
Agnes does not

09:23.396 --> 09:24.832
have the temperament
to be strippin'.

09:26.366 --> 09:27.935
- She was with that douchebag

09:27.935 --> 09:29.603
from the public defender's
office, that prick.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.304
- Oh God, I hope she marries
that fuck soon.

09:31.304 --> 09:34.507
- Yeah, she thought
you had no money.

09:34.507 --> 09:36.143
- Hey, you gonna deal with
both of my family functions.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.679
- No, no, that's you.
- Not me, no, no, no, nope.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.247
- All right, what do we got?
Jim?

09:40.247 --> 09:43.250
- Um, my fuckin' family.
- Uh-huh.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.186
- My nephew, Sam.
- What? He just started.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.520
- Mm-hmm.
- Three months ago?

09:47.520 --> 09:50.357
- And they got him pretty good.
- Who?

09:50.357 --> 09:52.259
- The blacks.
- How?

09:52.259 --> 09:54.461
- I don't know.
Somethin' about

09:54.461 --> 09:56.529
one of them
always joking with him,

09:56.529 --> 10:00.634
buddying up, asking him
to mail a letter home.

10:00.634 --> 10:03.370
Some other bullshit about
another guard blockin' his mail.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.873
He did it.
- What a cherry.

10:05.873 --> 10:08.308
Geez, didn't you prep him
any better than this?

10:08.308 --> 10:10.543
- But he's fuckin' 22, Mike.

10:10.543 --> 10:13.613
He thinks these pieces of shit
are his brothers.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.149
These kids, they don't,
they don't get it, man.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.550
They just, they don't see it.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.219
- Yeah, well,
they fuckin' got him now.

10:19.219 --> 10:22.856
Okay?
- Yeah.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.395
Who's the inmate?

10:28.395 --> 10:30.864
- This piece of shit.

10:32.766 --> 10:35.969
- He got a gang outside?
- Yeah, he's Crip.

10:37.905 --> 10:41.074
- Okay, well, there ya go.
That's good news, right?

10:41.374 --> 10:43.310
There's always
this sanction thing.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.578
We're fine, right?
And the inmate's

10:45.578 --> 10:48.048
not tryin' to put your nephew
in his pocket, right?

10:48.048 --> 10:49.516
You know, all right, look.

10:49.516 --> 10:52.219
If your nephew sent a letter
to any guy in the juice,

10:52.219 --> 10:53.553
then I'll get the thing back.

10:53.553 --> 10:55.188
But we're gonna have
to make a trade for it.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.224
So is swing shift
the best time to launch a ball?

10:57.224 --> 10:59.226
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And look, everybody's onboard.

10:59.226 --> 11:02.129
All right, it's not like we all,
we all haven't been there.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.898
- Just make sure there's no
Rambos in the turrets, okay?

11:04.898 --> 11:06.199
If I get this letter,
they're gonna pick

11:06.199 --> 11:08.836
the day and the time.
So, we got to be ready.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.871
For somethin' like this,
I'm sure it's gonna be tarred.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.706
Just make sure we have
our people in the yard.

11:12.706 --> 11:14.942
Okay? No fuckin' subs.
- It's not a problem.

11:14.942 --> 11:17.410
Our whole fuckin' unit
runs the place, except SIS.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.678
It's fine, Mike.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.147
- I don't want any sweeps,
none of that shit

11:20.147 --> 11:22.850
'cause I gotta let everybody
know of this, all right?

11:23.951 --> 11:27.087
Your nephew, gonna have a target
on his back for a while.

11:28.956 --> 11:31.524
- Once we get this handled,
we'll put him up in a tower.

11:31.524 --> 11:32.760
Okay? He'll be fine.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.127
- Yeah, well,
I don't know about that

11:34.127 --> 11:35.462
because he'll probably wanna
start shootin' people

11:35.462 --> 11:37.630
left, right and center.

11:37.630 --> 11:40.467
- As long as he shoots
the right fool.

11:40.467 --> 11:43.804
- Hey, I'll handle it.

11:44.404 --> 11:45.472
Okay?
- Yeah.

11:45.472 --> 11:46.639
- Let's go.
- Thanks, Mike.

11:46.639 --> 11:47.941
Best to the mayor, all right?
- Yeah.

11:47.941 --> 11:51.544
- Hey Mike,
is this gonna cost him with you?

11:52.946 --> 11:54.882
- Absolutely.

12:06.593 --> 12:09.362
- Well, even today,
the textbooks will teach you

12:09.362 --> 12:11.765
that it was a war
over state's rights.

12:11.765 --> 12:14.567
The result is the same.
And it was.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.404
It was a war
over state's rights.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.672
It was over
a state's right to decide

12:19.672 --> 12:22.209
its own position on slavery.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.778
So, this was a war

12:24.778 --> 12:29.549
fought for the freedom
to choose slavery.

12:29.883 --> 12:32.786
And the only time
in recorded history

12:32.786 --> 12:35.622
that the oppressors
fought each other

12:35.622 --> 12:38.725
over the rights
of the oppressed.

12:39.126 --> 12:43.730
It was the most formative event
in this nation's history.

12:44.531 --> 12:47.367
But the catharsis
of that union victory

12:47.367 --> 12:51.571
and the freedom of the slaves,
it was short lived.

12:51.571 --> 12:54.674
A decade later,
a new Union army

12:54.674 --> 12:58.145
made up of mostly
imprisoned Confederate soldiers

12:58.145 --> 13:01.614
and immigrants
reignited the genocide

13:01.614 --> 13:05.485
begun by Columbus
some 400 years earlier.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.021
There's a wonderful-

13:08.021 --> 13:10.490
- Okay, read the first two
chapters.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.359
I'll see you all tomorrow.

13:12.359 --> 13:13.793
- All right, ladies.
Take your books.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.263
Leave your pencils.
We'll start here.

13:27.007 --> 13:30.443
- My grandparents
are from Pine Ridge.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.812
That's where I was raised.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.515
- You're a long way from home.

13:35.748 --> 13:38.151
Do you know this?
- No.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.287
- Well, it might speak to you.

13:40.287 --> 13:42.455
It's about how your family
came to live on Pine Ridge

13:42.455 --> 13:44.724
in the first place.

13:45.425 --> 13:48.528
- Um, I was wondering.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.163
I got a cousin coming here

13:50.163 --> 13:54.601
and I was hoping
you'd ask the mayor.

13:54.601 --> 13:58.505
I don't have any money,
but it's nothing.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.773
If I hadn't
gotten written up for-

14:00.773 --> 14:04.644
- Don't ever, ever,

14:06.246 --> 14:09.049
mention my sons to me again.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.652
Is that clear?

14:12.652 --> 14:14.387
- I didn't mean
to be disrespectful.

14:14.387 --> 14:17.024
- Get the fuck outta here.

14:42.515 --> 14:44.784
- Yeah.
- All right, what happened?

14:44.784 --> 14:47.287
- It's a problem.
- How big a problem?

14:47.287 --> 14:49.022
- Like a seven.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.757
- You gotta start on it
right now?

14:50.757 --> 14:52.325
- Uh, well, I should.

14:52.325 --> 14:55.095
- You near the lake?
- Yeah, I'm passing it.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.664
- Good, so am I.
Meet me at the beach.

15:04.871 --> 15:08.475
- Milo buried his take
on some land north of here.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.510
We gotta go get it.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.579
- Great.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.382
- It's a hassle, but it's worth
10 for our trouble.

15:16.984 --> 15:20.220
- Yeah.
Gonna need Kyle.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.456
- He's not on duty.
- Tell him to pick up a shift.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.697
- How was Ed?

15:31.098 --> 15:33.466
- Tim Weaver's nephew
got hooked.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.668
Mailed a letter
to some low-level Crip.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.904
I don't know
if it was sanctioned.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.479
- Fuckin' Mondays.

15:48.115 --> 15:51.018
Fuckin' Mondays.

15:52.319 --> 15:55.255
Fuck it, get in the car.
Let's go see Bunny.

15:55.255 --> 15:56.656
- All right.

16:25.118 --> 16:26.319
- Why are y'all
dressed like cops?

16:26.319 --> 16:27.554
- Why are you dressed

16:27.554 --> 16:29.256
like you're mannin'
a weather station?

16:29.256 --> 16:31.824
- You're a funny motherfucker,
Mitch.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.826
- It is hot as hell up in here
for October though, right?

16:33.826 --> 16:35.528
- Take your parka off.
Enjoy autumn, fuck.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.030
- What the fuck
you want me to do?

16:37.030 --> 16:38.198
Sit behind a desk?
Nah-uh,

16:38.198 --> 16:40.233
this coat holds all of my shit.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.402
- Can we get five minutes
with you?

16:42.402 --> 16:44.104
- You,
go chill by the front door.

16:44.104 --> 16:47.874
You, go get me a uh, a snowcone.

16:47.874 --> 16:49.442
- Where I gonna
find you a snowcone?

16:49.442 --> 16:51.578
- The 7-11, fool.
- That's a Slurpie.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.680
You gotta get a snowcone
from a snowcone truck.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.915
I could get you a Blizzard.
Got them Blizzards at the Q.

16:55.915 --> 16:57.650
- Yeah, you are dressed
for a blizzard.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.619
- Motherfucker, go get me
some cold, frozen shit.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.621
I don't care where it from,
aight?

17:01.621 --> 17:04.524
- Aight.
- Fruit flavored.

17:05.892 --> 17:09.596
I'm sorry, do I speak Spanish
or some shit like that?

17:09.596 --> 17:11.598
Damn.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.266
What y'all doin' down here?

17:13.266 --> 17:14.634
- Well, one of your guys,
he hooked a guard.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.002
Clean kid, real green.

17:16.002 --> 17:18.271
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
my boy got that letter.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.673
So, what, y'all wanna trade?
- Sure.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.842
- What you got?
I mean, I fish a good catch.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.877
They, they can milk
that fool forever.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.914
- Ah, it's Tim Weaver's nephew,
so, it's not gonna go that far.

17:27.914 --> 17:30.450
- Cold motherfucker,
I outta trick his nephew out.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.585
- Yeah, if you wanna
get your son shot in the yard.

17:32.585 --> 17:35.855
- True dat, true dat.
True dat shit.

17:36.656 --> 17:39.726
Okay, just the FedEX then.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.862
But I gotta move some product,
so get me a kilo over.

17:42.862 --> 17:45.031
- FedEx is only two ounces,
Bunny.

17:45.031 --> 17:46.766
- Y'all 'bout to be
some tennis ball hittin'

17:46.766 --> 17:48.201
motherfuckers, man.
Come on.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.869
- Shit, come on.
This helps you out

17:49.869 --> 17:51.504
as much as anyone. I mean,
Tim's wired pretty tight.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.573
Everyone's on his side.
This is free money for you.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.542
It was a good catch. Your guy
just picked the wrong kid.

17:55.542 --> 17:58.278
I'm just here to warn you,
but come on.

17:58.278 --> 18:01.148
One FedEx, that's it.

18:02.382 --> 18:04.251
- Deal.

18:04.517 --> 18:07.053
- All right then.
Thank you.

18:07.053 --> 18:08.621
- You know, we woulda
killed each other by now

18:08.621 --> 18:10.323
if it wasn't for you?

18:10.323 --> 18:13.025
Everybody in this
whole motherfucker be dead

18:13.025 --> 18:15.462
if it wasn't for you.

18:15.995 --> 18:17.597
- Thanks, Bunny.

18:18.030 --> 18:19.766
- But ya'll some sorry-ass
businessmen, though.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.934
Y'all do all this shit
and don't even get paid?

18:21.934 --> 18:24.003
I mean, come on, man, that some
co-dependent white man shit.

18:24.003 --> 18:25.805
- You can send us a check
if you want.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.207
- Fuck that!

18:27.207 --> 18:31.544
You hang around, I'll give you
some of my Blizzard though.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.881
Aight!

19:27.033 --> 19:28.735
- Oh shit.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.104
Here he come, y'all.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.975
- Five.
- Five top.

19:39.011 --> 19:42.081
- Six.
- Six top.

19:44.150 --> 19:46.586
- Seven.
- Seven top.

19:48.688 --> 19:51.090
- Eight.
- Eight top.

19:51.090 --> 19:52.359
- Almost time.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.060
- Come on.
- Nine.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.062
- Come to daddy.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.033
- Ten.
- Ten top.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.506
- I need somethin' from you,
baby.

20:06.506 --> 20:09.276
- Don't call me that.
Get in the cell.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.745
- Bitch, I own you.

20:12.745 --> 20:16.816
You sent my boy $500 with tar
and coke all over that shit.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.785
You're either my bitch out there

20:18.785 --> 20:21.521
or I make you my girl
when they send your ass here

20:21.521 --> 20:23.823
in motherfuckin' chains.

20:24.357 --> 20:28.361
- I'm tryin' to help you, man.
- What you expect?

20:28.661 --> 20:31.063
I'm a criminal, baby.

20:33.300 --> 20:36.803
- Look, I'm not gonna break
the fuckin' law for you, man.

20:37.203 --> 20:39.572
You understand me?

20:44.944 --> 20:47.714
- You're gonna do exactly
what the fuck I tell you.

20:47.714 --> 20:49.048
Or the DA's gonna be

20:49.048 --> 20:51.651
readin' your letter tomorrow,
motherfucker.

21:09.168 --> 21:12.705
- Bottom eleven, officer down.
Officer down.

22:10.830 --> 22:14.033
- What?
Yeah, I'm on my way.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.870
No, listen, I gotta go to
the fuckin' station first, okay?

22:19.205 --> 22:20.707
Tracy, yeah, thrilled.

22:20.707 --> 22:22.141
She loves it
when I pick up shifts

22:22.141 --> 22:23.776
an hour before
a dinner reservation.

22:23.776 --> 22:25.745
No, I pick you up.

22:26.245 --> 22:28.848
All right.
Geez.

22:41.093 --> 22:43.596
- And that's it.
- That's it?

22:43.596 --> 22:45.331
I don't kneed it?
- Nope.

22:45.331 --> 22:48.868
You let it sit overnight.
Time does the work.

22:51.838 --> 22:54.073
Why did you pick up a shift?

22:56.375 --> 22:58.044
- Ma, don't start, okay?

22:58.044 --> 23:01.080
- Your brothers are involved,
I'm sure.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.683
- What aren't they involved in?

23:03.916 --> 23:06.486
I gotta go.
- Be careful.

23:10.156 --> 23:12.324
- Why would you say that to me?
- Well,

23:12.324 --> 23:15.628
if your brothers are involved,
then you should be careful.

23:15.628 --> 23:18.164
- Yeah.

23:40.953 --> 23:43.255
- Harmony candles,
burning for yoga

23:43.255 --> 23:46.025
or whatever they're for.
No one really ever knows.

23:46.025 --> 23:50.062
She's sitting right there.
She's sitting right there.

23:50.062 --> 23:53.132
Oh, she's starin' at the candle.

23:56.402 --> 24:00.206
- She's starin' at the candle
and she says...

24:01.273 --> 24:03.976
Can I make a mold of it
out of candle wax?

24:04.376 --> 24:06.546
And this guy, he starts thinkin'
about it, didn't you?

24:06.546 --> 24:08.815
You sick son of a bitch.
He starts thinkin' about it.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.917
Then the next thing you know.

24:11.484 --> 24:13.119
Kyle, hey, man.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.722
Hey, I gotta go.
I gotta go.

24:16.022 --> 24:17.557
Come on.
- Hey, Mitch.

24:17.557 --> 24:18.925
Come here,
this guy's just never-

24:18.925 --> 24:20.793
- No, no, no. Just do
what you gotta do on that.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.128
- Come on,
we can look the other way.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.362
I don't mind
givin' the guy a chance,

24:23.362 --> 24:25.832
but not on a chance
he keeps stealin' shit.

24:25.832 --> 24:27.033
- Well, then take him then.

24:27.033 --> 24:28.400
Artie's gonna like it,
I'm tellin' you.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.269
- Artie can go fuck himself.
We're doin' him a favor.

24:30.269 --> 24:32.404
This kid's an embarrassment
and you know it.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.041
- Yeah.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.278
Jesus Christ.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.683
- So, what's this emergency?
- Dig somethin' up with Mike.

24:43.683 --> 24:45.251
- What?
- You remember Milo?

24:45.251 --> 24:46.953
- Oh, we're not keepin'
that promise, are we?

24:46.953 --> 24:48.154
- Yes, we are.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.556
He buried it
up in Cottonwood Canyon.

24:49.556 --> 24:51.991
- Hey, that's county.
- Those crooks up there

24:51.991 --> 24:53.793
aren't gonna give you
any jurisdictional BS.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.027
- Well, what do you need me for?

24:55.027 --> 24:56.729
- If they do,
if anyone should show up,

24:56.729 --> 24:58.230
you tell 'em
you're workin' on a tip.

24:58.230 --> 25:01.634
It paid off and the department
gets a feather in its cap.

25:02.068 --> 25:04.937
- And Milo's okay with that?
- That's the risk.

25:05.672 --> 25:08.040
- A great way to spend
my night off, Mitch, thank you.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.375
- I don't wanna
fuckin' go either.

25:09.375 --> 25:11.143
Come on, let's go.
- What the fuck are you wearin'?

25:11.143 --> 25:12.745
- Come on, he didn't tell you
where we're goin'?

25:12.745 --> 25:14.313
- No.
- Bear country.

25:14.313 --> 25:15.982
- Not in here.
Get the fuck outta my car.

25:15.982 --> 25:17.283
- You're not takin' me?
- No.

25:17.283 --> 25:18.651
- Fuck.

25:19.218 --> 25:21.053
- Let's go, you fucker.
- Hey, you got an extra pair?

25:21.053 --> 25:22.689
- Hey.
- What?

25:22.689 --> 25:24.791
- Go straight to the office and
then right into the safe, yeah?

25:24.791 --> 25:27.059
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on.

25:27.059 --> 25:28.227
- That bear's gonna
shoot you dead

25:28.227 --> 25:32.364
and you got loafers on.
You are fucked.

26:23.883 --> 26:27.086
- I know you.
- Thank you.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.955
- Come dance for me.

26:29.155 --> 26:30.957
- I'll find you when I'm done.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.524
- How'd it go with the troopers?

27:05.524 --> 27:08.260
- Ah, they said it'd be
a couple of weeks, so.

27:08.260 --> 27:10.897
- But it went well, right?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.

27:10.897 --> 27:13.232
I mean,
it's basically a demotion.

27:13.232 --> 27:14.734
So, I was expectin' it,
you know.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.969
- Yeah, fuck you.
It's way better pay, man.

27:16.969 --> 27:19.305
More important, it's your
fuckin' ticket outta here.

27:19.305 --> 27:20.973
This shithole.

27:21.540 --> 27:24.076
- Yeah, well,
here's all I know.

27:24.610 --> 27:26.578
- Yeah, here's all
anybody knows, bub.

27:27.279 --> 27:29.015
- Hey, look over there.

27:29.015 --> 27:30.683
- Well, you know, if you hate it
so much,

27:30.683 --> 27:32.518
why don't you fuckin' leave?

27:32.785 --> 27:35.087
- I'm a felon with no skills.

27:35.688 --> 27:37.757
Where the hell am I gonna go?

27:38.490 --> 27:40.259
This way.

27:41.694 --> 27:45.164
I was lookin' at this school
in Wyoming.

27:45.865 --> 27:48.600
And they teach you
to cook in these Dutch ovens.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.402
And it's kinda like
camp cooking, right?

27:50.402 --> 27:51.670
But what's great about it,

27:51.670 --> 27:54.841
it's 100% job placement
when you finish.

27:54.841 --> 27:58.010
So, I figure, you know,
spend a year cooking,

27:58.010 --> 28:00.713
just fishing trips,
hunting trips.

28:00.713 --> 28:05.151
No one to answer to but a fire.
No consequences, but what?

28:05.384 --> 28:07.754
A bad meal maybe, right?

28:07.754 --> 28:10.222
- Well, you never
made one of those.

28:10.222 --> 28:11.824
How's the pay?

28:11.824 --> 28:14.560
- It's garbage,
but how much you need?

28:14.560 --> 28:15.862
I don't need shit.

28:15.862 --> 28:18.030
- Yeah,
but you're no cowboy, Mike.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.066
I mean, no disrespect
to your cabin,

28:20.066 --> 28:22.468
but you got runnin' water
and lights.

28:22.468 --> 28:23.770
- Fuck you.
The only reason

28:23.770 --> 28:26.272
why I don't do it?
Grizzlies, man.

28:26.272 --> 28:27.874
Fuckin' grizzlies.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.976
- Oh, you and the bears, man.
- Dude, all the fuckin' bears.

28:29.976 --> 28:33.212
I know my fuckin' place
in the food chain, brother.

28:33.746 --> 28:37.817
Yes, this is it.

28:39.618 --> 28:41.921
- This is it?
- We did just do it, cut fence.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.389
There's supposed to be
a rock here.

28:43.389 --> 28:44.924
Hand me that.

28:44.924 --> 28:48.360
A rock's on
the other side of this shit.

28:51.263 --> 28:53.165
Oh, fuck, here it is.

28:55.301 --> 28:57.236
There's a rock.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.172
- Got it?
- Yep.

29:04.243 --> 29:05.744
- Oh yeah.

29:14.120 --> 29:16.889
- Two hundred grand
in the fuckin' ground.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.960
There it is, son of a bitch.

29:25.331 --> 29:26.899
All right.

29:27.466 --> 29:30.002
I'm glad it's not
a fucking body.

29:31.871 --> 29:34.506
- Well, I gotta say, Mike.
That was pretty anti-climactic.

29:34.506 --> 29:36.242
- Yeah, that's how I like it.

29:36.775 --> 29:39.045
Let's go home.

29:39.045 --> 29:40.746
- Roger that.

30:17.049 --> 30:19.986
- Let's go to the jungle room.

30:20.319 --> 30:22.621
- You have to pay upfront.

30:23.022 --> 30:26.158
A hundred fifty, three songs.

30:26.158 --> 30:29.862
- I know the rules.
- I have to tell you.

30:31.563 --> 30:33.565
Three songs.

30:34.200 --> 30:37.937
I can be nude,
but you can't touch me.

30:39.271 --> 30:43.142
Or you can touch me
and I keep my dress on.

30:46.412 --> 30:48.747
- Which do you want?

30:49.548 --> 30:52.251
- Touch me.

30:54.420 --> 30:56.722
- Let's go.

32:37.323 --> 32:39.325
- That's it, I'm good.

32:42.394 --> 32:44.396
I'm gonna see you again.

32:44.396 --> 32:46.432
- Hey.

32:46.999 --> 32:49.435
I don't want you to go.

32:50.269 --> 32:52.338
- I gotta go.

33:27.673 --> 33:29.841
- All right,
I'm runnin' two sets.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.443
The first set
will dissolve on its own.

33:31.443 --> 33:34.080
And I'll take out
the top layer in 10 days.

33:34.080 --> 33:36.315
- No concussion?
- No, I don't think so.

33:36.315 --> 33:38.884
But if you feel any dizziness
or nausea,

33:38.884 --> 33:41.353
I want you
to tell me immediately.

33:41.353 --> 33:44.490
- You feel up to walking me
through what happened?

33:47.426 --> 33:51.363
- Uh, yeah, he uh,

33:51.363 --> 33:53.932
he's been giving me
a lot of lip for a while.

33:53.932 --> 33:56.168
Nothin' that crossed the line,

33:56.168 --> 33:59.238
but I instructed him
to enter his cell.

33:59.238 --> 34:03.109
He stepped toward me.
Told me to make him.

34:03.109 --> 34:06.745
I told him to step back.
He didn't.

34:06.945 --> 34:10.015
I pushed him.
He grabbed me.

34:11.650 --> 34:14.019
I don't know, maybe a headbutt.

34:14.019 --> 34:16.122
It was all pretty nuts.

34:16.122 --> 34:18.056
I managed to
retrieve my nightstick

34:18.056 --> 34:21.293
and deliver a straight thrust
that stepped him back.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.396
Struck him again.

34:24.396 --> 34:27.266
He pulled me down.
I called out.

34:30.869 --> 34:34.273
- Well, son, your first mistake
was allowing him into your space

34:34.273 --> 34:37.243
and not calling for backup then.

34:37.243 --> 34:40.212
We've all made our mistakes.

34:40.212 --> 34:44.283
That club is a last resort.
What is your first resort?

34:44.850 --> 34:47.386
- Pepper spray?
- Distance, son.

34:47.386 --> 34:50.689
What kind of shape
is what's his name?

34:50.689 --> 34:53.459
- Darryl Johnson, 2-6-4-0-7-5.

34:53.459 --> 34:57.829
He's ah,
you know he assaulted a guard.

34:57.829 --> 34:59.265
He got it pretty rough.

34:59.265 --> 35:01.032
- He's en route
to Kingstown General.

35:01.032 --> 35:03.202
We x-rayed him.
Two skull fractures,

35:03.202 --> 35:06.205
multiple facial fractures
and lacerations.

35:06.205 --> 35:08.106
He was stable when he left,
but brain swelling

35:08.106 --> 35:10.642
is gonna be
the real hurdle here.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.844
- Is Darryl affiliated?

35:12.844 --> 35:14.246
- He's a Crip.

35:14.246 --> 35:17.048
- All right,
let's put Sam in a tower.

35:17.048 --> 35:18.984
We'll look into Darryl's cell,
and who he's close to,

35:18.984 --> 35:20.452
work some transfers.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.120
You're gonna be
in the bird's nest

35:22.120 --> 35:24.456
for a while, son, a long while.

35:24.456 --> 35:28.527
Now, it's not a punishment.
It's for your protection.

35:29.695 --> 35:31.530
- Thank you, sir.

35:33.999 --> 35:36.402
- Thank you, Captain.
- Thanks, Cap.

35:54.119 --> 35:55.621
- Thanks, Owen.

35:55.621 --> 35:57.523
- No problem.
- See ya.

36:53.979 --> 36:55.381
- TV: The way that
your face is turned

36:55.381 --> 36:56.815
and the way that
you're owning that shot

36:56.815 --> 37:01.152
with all of the bondage
that's happening is really good.

37:02.388 --> 37:06.758
- I know you from earlier,
from the mayor's office.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.160
That's what I meant.

37:17.202 --> 37:19.771
- I didn't see you there.

37:22.173 --> 37:24.476
- I was there.

37:25.377 --> 37:28.246
Why do they call him the mayor?

37:28.847 --> 37:30.949
- Because he runs the city.

37:31.683 --> 37:34.586
- I wonder what
the real mayor thinks of that.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.222
- The real mayor knows it too.

37:47.999 --> 37:50.168
- You owe me two dances.

37:51.303 --> 37:53.271
- Come to the club tomorrow.

37:53.271 --> 37:55.841
I'll give them to you.

37:58.877 --> 38:01.347
- I want them now.

38:02.981 --> 38:05.317
- Okay.

38:15.260 --> 38:17.162
- Fuck, you motherfucker.

38:17.162 --> 38:19.230
- Fuck you.

38:19.765 --> 38:20.932
- Fuckin' bitch.

38:20.932 --> 38:23.769
- Somebody help me, fuck.
Fuck you.

38:43.622 --> 38:45.591
- What's this?

38:50.562 --> 38:54.199
Looks like the motherlode,
huh, bitch.

38:55.133 --> 38:56.802
Mayor won't even see me.

38:56.802 --> 38:59.405
There's money there
and it's for your ass.

39:03.842 --> 39:06.244
That shit's mine now.

39:26.765 --> 39:28.099
- Can you speed it up there,
Mike?

39:28.099 --> 39:30.335
I gotta start my real shift
in an hour.

39:30.335 --> 39:32.170
- Well, obviously,
it builds character, bub.

39:32.170 --> 39:33.939
- What am I?
In SEAL training?

39:33.939 --> 39:35.373
I got three fuckin' open cases.

39:35.373 --> 39:38.343
Oh my God, thank you.
- Oh, please stop whining.

39:38.343 --> 39:40.746
And let's get you a coffee here.
How's that?

39:40.746 --> 39:43.381
- Sounds good to me.
Finally, finally.

39:43.381 --> 39:46.952
- Maybe some fucking Cheerios.
- Yeah, ooh, that sounds good.

39:55.927 --> 39:58.864
- All right. Wait, wait.

39:58.864 --> 40:00.031
Hey.
- Yeah.

40:00.031 --> 40:01.399
- You there?
- You got it?

40:01.399 --> 40:03.201
- Yeah, we're good.

40:03.201 --> 40:04.636
- It's all there?

40:04.636 --> 40:07.005
- Well, I didn't
fuckin' count it.

40:07.973 --> 40:09.307
- All right.
Look, you need some rest.

40:09.307 --> 40:11.242
We gotta get that FedEx
from Bunny.

40:11.242 --> 40:14.145
- Yeah, well,
Bunny's probably not up though.

40:14.145 --> 40:15.981
- Well, fuck him.
Somethin' happened last night.

40:15.981 --> 40:18.817
I need it sent today.

40:19.217 --> 40:20.952
- What happened?

40:20.952 --> 40:23.188
- I'll tell you about it
at the office.

40:23.188 --> 40:24.856
- All right.

40:52.183 --> 40:55.220
- Fuck.
- What is this?

40:57.489 --> 40:59.758
- That's a map.
- For what?

40:59.758 --> 41:02.260
Money, right?

41:02.260 --> 41:04.262
- That's correct.

41:05.230 --> 41:06.832
- Where is it?

41:07.866 --> 41:10.301
- Well, it should be
in the safe.

41:12.137 --> 41:14.405
- You're being pretty agreeable.

41:15.507 --> 41:17.342
- Well, I wouldn't die
protecting my own money.

41:17.342 --> 41:20.411
I'm sure as hell not gonna die
protecting someone else's.

41:21.246 --> 41:24.049
- Whose is it?

41:24.349 --> 41:27.719
- Someone you don't
wanna steal from,

41:27.719 --> 41:30.255
but that's between you and him.

41:30.255 --> 41:32.490
- Open the safe.

42:01.753 --> 42:04.422
- It ain't between me
and whoever

42:05.490 --> 42:07.926
'cause whoever ain't
gonna know it was me.

42:33.985 --> 42:36.154
- Workin' 24/7 these days,
eh Bunny?

42:36.154 --> 42:37.923
- Sign of the times, man.

42:37.923 --> 42:41.226
- Yeah, all right, look.
We gotta send it today.

42:41.492 --> 42:43.128
Sorry.

42:43.128 --> 42:44.963
- Why is that?
- Fuck if I know, man.

42:44.963 --> 42:46.732
Talk to the mayor about it.
I have no idea.

42:46.732 --> 42:50.869
- Well, the mayor ain't been
takin' my calls this mornin'.

42:51.236 --> 42:53.138
What you gotta say about that?

42:53.138 --> 42:55.040
- What do you mean?
He's in the office.

42:55.040 --> 42:56.808
Just give him a call.

42:56.808 --> 42:58.910
- Hey.
- Whoa, whoa.

42:58.910 --> 43:01.847
- What the fuck, motherfucker.

43:01.847 --> 43:03.181
- Put down that
fucking gun down, Mike.

43:03.181 --> 43:04.816
Put the fuckin' gun down.
- Put your gun down.

43:04.816 --> 43:06.317
- I ain't playin'.

43:06.317 --> 43:08.086
Somebody shoot through
that motherfucker, man, come on.

43:09.120 --> 43:10.521
- You done?
All right, put the gun down.

43:10.521 --> 43:12.223
- Don't shoot.
Put your fuckin' gun down.

43:12.223 --> 43:13.859
- Don't fuckin' shoot, man.
- Put your fuckin' gun down.

43:13.859 --> 43:15.727
- Do what the man says.

43:15.927 --> 43:17.796
Do it!

43:18.529 --> 43:22.167
- A different deal now, huh?
What the hell, Bunny?

43:22.167 --> 43:23.468
- We made a trade.
- Yeah.

43:23.468 --> 43:26.437
- And one of your guards
worked my boy good.

43:26.437 --> 43:28.206
He on life support at General,
Mike.

43:28.206 --> 43:29.775
- I don't know
anything about that, okay?

43:29.775 --> 43:31.609
But we never
fuckin' break a deal.

43:31.609 --> 43:35.113
Do you understand?
Never with anybody, ever.

43:35.113 --> 43:36.447
- Aight, aight, aight.

43:36.447 --> 43:38.383
We're just a little worked up.
That's all.

43:38.383 --> 43:43.354
That's all, man, okay?
- Yeah, ya think?

43:44.690 --> 43:48.193
What the fuck?
Maybe fuckin' decaf next time.

43:48.193 --> 43:50.461
I'll talk to Mitch and see
what the fuck went south.

43:50.461 --> 43:52.530
And we'll fix it.
But look at me.

43:52.530 --> 43:54.299
The only way
this shit works for anyone

43:54.299 --> 43:57.268
is if everyone trusts us.

43:57.268 --> 43:59.971
That way we can trust you, okay?

43:59.971 --> 44:01.239
- Aight, aight.

44:01.239 --> 44:02.507
- Don't point a gun at me,
motherfucker.

44:02.507 --> 44:04.609
- I got you, man.
I'm just a little worked up.

44:04.609 --> 44:07.112
- Yeah, I hear you.
- He's dyin' up in there.

44:07.112 --> 44:09.247
He's leavin' that place
in a box, Mike.

44:09.247 --> 44:12.417
A fuckin' box.
That's my fuckin' cousin, Mike.

44:12.417 --> 44:15.687
- Everyone's someone's
fuckin' cousin in this town.

44:16.221 --> 44:18.757
- He took my fuckin' gun.
- Go get it, he's right there.

44:20.992 --> 44:23.161
There he go, go get it.

44:24.996 --> 44:28.266
- OPERATOR: You've reached the
voice mailbox of Mitch McLusky.

44:28.266 --> 44:29.801
Please leave a message.

44:29.801 --> 44:31.903
- Mitch, you fuckin'
son of a bitch, where are you?

44:31.903 --> 44:33.471
Where the fuck are you?
Where are you?

44:33.471 --> 44:35.040
Is this what
you wanted to tell me, huh?

44:35.040 --> 44:36.641
What the fuck happened?

44:36.641 --> 44:39.577
Those maniacs just tried
to fuckin' kill me, Mitch.

44:39.577 --> 44:41.546
Ya know, gettin' this letter's
gonna be a fuckin' lot of work.

44:41.546 --> 44:44.449
You know that?
Pick up your fuckin' phone.

44:44.449 --> 44:46.117
Fuck!

44:51.189 --> 44:52.791
What the fuck?

44:54.893 --> 44:56.661
Shit.

44:57.195 --> 44:59.197
What the hell?

45:04.903 --> 45:06.437
What?

45:06.437 --> 45:08.439
- Mike, just jump into my car
here, let me talk to ya.

45:08.439 --> 45:10.441
- What happened?
- Let me just talk to ya.

45:10.441 --> 45:12.343
Mike, you don't wanna see this.
- The fuck I don't.

45:12.343 --> 45:15.313
- Mike, slow down
let me talk to you.

45:15.713 --> 45:17.215
Come on.

45:20.986 --> 45:23.088
- How?

45:24.189 --> 45:26.557
- A gunshot back of the head,
Mike, it was real quick.

45:26.557 --> 45:28.626
Mike, Mike, come on.

45:28.626 --> 45:30.428
- RADIO: One, David, one, zero,
nine, nine, nine, six.

45:33.098 --> 45:36.467
- You're all right.
Mike, look.

45:38.536 --> 45:39.771
- What the fuck?

45:39.771 --> 45:41.672
- Vera Center was found dead
in her house last night.

45:41.672 --> 45:43.041
She was raped, strangled

45:43.041 --> 45:44.609
and this motherfucker's prints
are there too.

45:44.609 --> 45:46.778
This guy should put up a goddamn
billboard, Mike.

45:46.778 --> 45:48.346
I don't know.
I just know

45:48.346 --> 45:50.816
that I'm not gonna be able to
hide the fuckin' link on this.

45:50.816 --> 45:52.350
- Is it a secret there?

45:52.350 --> 45:54.419
- Yeah, it's common knowledge
and it's public knowledge.

45:54.419 --> 45:56.321
But if the state, feds, and the
fuckin' news pick up on this.

45:56.321 --> 45:57.722
Mike, I just need you
to make sure

45:57.722 --> 46:00.558
it just all stays with Mitch.
- Yep, yeah.

46:00.558 --> 46:02.027
- Mike, you don't
need to see it.

46:02.027 --> 46:03.461
All right.
You just don't need to see it.

46:03.461 --> 46:05.196
It's not gonna fuckin' do
anything for you.

46:05.196 --> 46:07.698
We got this fucker.
- I-I've gotta see it.

46:07.698 --> 46:09.467
- We got this guy,
SWAT's at his house right now.

46:09.467 --> 46:11.269
We're gonna fuckin' go there.
- It's my brother.

46:11.269 --> 46:12.938
I gotta see it.
Just let me see it.

46:12.938 --> 46:14.172
- All right,
don't touch anything.

46:14.172 --> 46:15.173
- Fine.
- Everybody's watchin' on this.

46:15.173 --> 46:17.775
- Fine.
- Let's make some room.

47:49.100 --> 47:51.369
- I mean, how else
could it end?

47:52.103 --> 47:53.905
For you too.

47:56.107 --> 47:58.743
When you help these parasites.

48:00.645 --> 48:03.581
You hold it together
for everyone else.

48:12.790 --> 48:15.426
It's fuckin' inevitable.

48:19.664 --> 48:22.833
Ya know, I always knew
that this would happen.

48:27.305 --> 48:30.441
I just thought
it would happen to you.

48:46.557 --> 48:48.626
- And so the United States Army

48:48.626 --> 48:51.262
moved the Cherokee further west.

48:51.262 --> 48:54.599
And this particular group,
some 1,600 people

48:54.599 --> 48:57.568
were pushed to a new home
in a territory

48:57.568 --> 49:00.738
that would become known
as Oklahoma.

49:01.806 --> 49:04.375
Upon reaching the banks
of the Mississippi

49:04.375 --> 49:07.145
where steamboats
would ferry them across,

49:07.145 --> 49:09.347
a dilemma arose.

49:09.347 --> 49:12.217
Every Cherokee family
keeps at least one dog,

49:12.217 --> 49:15.420
sometimes two or three
to aid in hunting,

49:15.420 --> 49:18.956
tracking game, protection,

49:18.956 --> 49:21.392
but to the Cherokee a dog

49:21.392 --> 49:24.529
is more than an aide
or a companion.

49:24.529 --> 49:29.367
It is a spirit helper,
an ancestor,

49:31.169 --> 49:33.338
a friend.

49:34.472 --> 49:37.175
Well, the ferry captains
wouldn't allow the dogs

49:37.175 --> 49:38.909
on board the boats,

49:38.909 --> 49:44.415
so, they pushed off,
leaving 3,000 dogs

49:44.415 --> 49:47.718
pacing the banks
of the Mississippi.

49:48.419 --> 49:50.888
When the boat
was a hundred yards out,

49:50.888 --> 49:53.324
almost in unison,

49:53.324 --> 49:56.694
the dogs began howling in agony.

49:57.128 --> 50:01.366
The Cherokees started crying,
calling to the captains.

50:01.366 --> 50:03.000
Turn back.

50:03.000 --> 50:08.439
The dogs hearing the pleas
of their families howled louder

50:08.439 --> 50:11.942
until one dog could stand
the separation no more

50:11.942 --> 50:14.345
and leapt into the river.

50:14.812 --> 50:18.883
Another dog followed
and another, and another.

50:18.883 --> 50:22.787
And soon 3,000 dogs
were churning the waters,

50:22.787 --> 50:27.692
fighting the current,
but the current was too strong.

50:27.692 --> 50:32.763
And one by one, they began
to disappear under the waters.

50:34.465 --> 50:36.934
Until there was
just one dog left.

50:37.902 --> 50:41.839
Strong, unwavering,

50:41.839 --> 50:46.877
the dog fought the current
and disappeared under the water

50:46.877 --> 50:49.814
and then reappeared
further downstream.

50:49.814 --> 50:55.019
The people screamed for him,
begging him to succeed.

50:56.954 --> 50:59.290
Until at last,

50:59.290 --> 51:02.627
too tired and no strength left,

51:02.627 --> 51:06.497
he disappeared into the waters
of the river.

51:06.497 --> 51:10.801
And the people
fell to their knees and wept.

51:17.508 --> 51:21.011
- Miriam, can I
have a word with you outside?

51:33.891 --> 51:35.960
- Aw, fuck.

51:38.263 --> 51:40.097
No.
- He in there?

51:40.097 --> 51:42.767
- Mike, you know how this works.
Come on, no way. No way.

51:42.767 --> 51:45.570
- Where is he? Come on.
I need this.

51:45.570 --> 51:48.072
Just give me this.
- Mike, it's not gonna happen.

51:48.072 --> 51:51.942
Mike, there's no way.
- It's for Mitch.

51:52.643 --> 51:54.078
- Mike, look, Mike.

51:54.078 --> 51:56.547
- If he goes to prison,
I can't fuckin' touch him.

51:56.547 --> 51:58.583
You understand that?
We don't work with the mafia.

51:58.583 --> 52:00.151
That fucker's gonna
sit in prison with his feet up

52:00.151 --> 52:03.188
for the rest of his fuckin' life
laughin' about this shit.

52:03.188 --> 52:04.622
- He won't.

52:04.622 --> 52:08.293
- Mike, I give you my word,
if he's alone in there,

52:08.293 --> 52:11.061
he will never
get off that couch.

52:11.629 --> 52:13.531
You hear me?
- Okay.

52:15.466 --> 52:16.667
- Don't worry, Mike.

52:16.667 --> 52:18.969
I do this shit for a livin',
brother.

52:19.970 --> 52:22.240
Come on boys, let's go.
- We got ya.

52:48.866 --> 52:52.603
- Here's what you will do.
Pick up the pistol.

52:54.439 --> 52:56.106
Do it.

52:56.674 --> 52:58.142
Come on, grab that gun.

52:58.142 --> 52:59.977
No, no, no, not by the barrel,
by the handle.

52:59.977 --> 53:02.680
You've seen too many movies,
Alberto.

53:03.281 --> 53:06.617
All right, good man.
Now point it toward the ceiling.

53:07.785 --> 53:09.454
Yeah.

53:09.787 --> 53:14.925
And bring the muzzle down
slowly in my direction.

53:22.933 --> 53:24.702
Thank you.

53:42.787 --> 53:46.724
- It went well.
The way you'd want it to go.

53:47.725 --> 53:49.927
He got to see it comin'.

53:51.296 --> 53:52.963
- Yeah.

54:25.296 --> 54:27.698
- How did this happen?

54:28.866 --> 54:31.336
- That's a really good question.

54:33.704 --> 54:36.341
- And who has the money?

54:36.874 --> 54:39.310
- The police.

54:39.877 --> 54:42.246
- Can you get it?

54:44.114 --> 54:45.816
- Nope.

54:49.019 --> 54:51.255
- That's going to be
a problem for you.

54:53.057 --> 54:54.725
- Son of a bitch.

54:59.664 --> 55:02.467
Now, listen to me.
They killed Milo's wife.

55:02.833 --> 55:04.369
They found the map.

55:04.369 --> 55:06.637
Then they killed
my fuckin' brother.

55:06.637 --> 55:09.807
Mitch was off limits.
And you know it.

55:09.807 --> 55:11.976
Everyone knew it.

55:12.309 --> 55:13.911
If Milo wants to blame us
for this shit,

55:13.911 --> 55:15.913
I'll have him killed in his cell
before midnight.

55:15.913 --> 55:18.215
Do you understand?

55:21.151 --> 55:23.421
Everything my brother gave you,

55:23.421 --> 55:26.256
I can take away in an afternoon.

55:26.256 --> 55:28.359
Don't ever threaten me again.

55:53.183 --> 55:54.952
Fuck!

1:00:03.067 --> 1:00:05.636
- Dawn.

1:00:07.404 --> 1:00:10.641
Have you ever once
come home before dawn?

1:00:15.179 --> 1:00:18.248
- Look, Ma, I don't-
- I don't either, Michael.

1:00:19.684 --> 1:00:22.219
What is there to say?

1:00:22.219 --> 1:00:24.588
He's gone.

1:00:25.489 --> 1:00:28.125
In the manner we all imagined.

1:00:31.595 --> 1:00:34.631
This will be your way, too,
you know?

1:00:34.631 --> 1:00:37.201
- Ma, we don't break the law.
You know that.

1:00:37.201 --> 1:00:39.336
We bend it.

1:00:39.336 --> 1:00:41.271
To make peace.

1:00:41.271 --> 1:00:43.708
For everybody.

1:00:43.708 --> 1:00:47.411
- I'm so familiar
with what you do.

1:00:47.411 --> 1:00:50.180
Your father invented it.

1:00:50.180 --> 1:00:53.150
But don't delude yourself
into thinking any of this

1:00:53.150 --> 1:00:55.853
is for the common good.

1:00:56.286 --> 1:00:59.757
You worked incredibly hard

1:00:59.757 --> 1:01:03.227
to accomplish
absolutely nothing.

1:01:03.227 --> 1:01:06.230
You prolonged the inevitable.

1:01:06.563 --> 1:01:11.135
Couriers, fix-it men,
part-time gangsters.

1:01:11.869 --> 1:01:13.303
And you think
because you don't

1:01:13.303 --> 1:01:17.641
make much money
that it's noble?

1:01:19.409 --> 1:01:24.614
Mitch, God rest his soul.
How I loved him.

1:01:25.816 --> 1:01:30.320
Was arrogant and lazy.
I know why he did it.

1:01:31.922 --> 1:01:35.459
For the attention, the power.

1:01:35.459 --> 1:01:37.795
But for the life of me,

1:01:37.795 --> 1:01:40.898
I'll never understand
why you do it.

1:01:41.932 --> 1:01:43.500
You hate it.

1:01:43.901 --> 1:01:47.637
You hate this town.
You have no friends.

1:01:48.672 --> 1:01:51.408
And all you've done
since you were a little boy

1:01:51.408 --> 1:01:54.078
is dream of leaving.

1:01:54.711 --> 1:01:57.915
And here you are.

1:01:58.615 --> 1:02:01.718
- What am I supposed to do, Ma?

1:02:04.221 --> 1:02:06.623
I don't know how to leave.

1:02:06.623 --> 1:02:12.029
- Michael, you just go.

1:02:57.607 --> 1:02:59.676
- Ugh.

1:03:29.706 --> 1:03:32.609
- Hi, I was hoping
you could help me.

1:03:32.609 --> 1:03:35.545
My daughter,
she's in the woman's prison

1:03:35.545 --> 1:03:37.647
and she wasn't...

1:03:37.647 --> 1:03:40.017
It doesn't matter.
She's in real trouble.

1:03:40.017 --> 1:03:41.551
I told her to
talk to the guards,

1:03:41.551 --> 1:03:43.954
but she said to come see you.

1:03:43.954 --> 1:03:46.924
- You got the wrong guy, ma'am.

1:03:46.924 --> 1:03:51.328
- Are you not the mayor?
- That was my brother.

1:03:52.897 --> 1:03:55.132
- I'm sorry to read that
in the newspaper.

1:03:55.132 --> 1:03:56.934
- Yeah, thank you.
Thank you.

1:03:56.934 --> 1:03:59.536
- My daughter,
she said to see you.

1:03:59.536 --> 1:04:01.171
She said that
you're the mayor now.

1:04:01.171 --> 1:04:04.408
- I'm sorry, but she's wrong.
She's wrong.

1:04:05.442 --> 1:04:07.844
- But, then what do I do?

1:04:07.844 --> 1:04:09.813
- I don't know.
- Sir,

1:04:09.813 --> 1:04:12.749
you don't understand, sir.
Please.

1:04:13.317 --> 1:04:15.652
I don't know
what they're gonna do to her.

1:04:16.053 --> 1:04:19.289
I don't know
what she will do to me.

1:04:21.992 --> 1:04:25.595
- Mike, this isn't for you.
Okay? Let's go.

1:04:26.063 --> 1:04:28.298
Let's go.
Come on, man.

1:04:31.168 --> 1:04:32.970
Mike.

1:04:41.245 --> 1:04:42.846
- What's her name?

1:04:57.361 --> 1:05:00.364
- MALE ANNOUNCER: Next time,
on "Mayor of Kingstown."

1:05:00.364 --> 1:05:02.432
- There's not one reason
for you to take this on.

1:05:02.432 --> 1:05:04.368
- MIKE:

1:05:04.368 --> 1:05:05.602
A lot of them.

1:05:05.602 --> 1:05:07.004
- Mitch wouldn't do
it that way, Mike.

1:05:07.004 --> 1:05:08.372
It's a big risk.

1:05:08.372 --> 1:05:09.673
- We had an arrangement
with your brother.

1:05:09.673 --> 1:05:11.441
We're here to decide if
you would be interested

1:05:11.441 --> 1:05:13.410
in being a paid informant.

1:05:13.410 --> 1:05:14.744
- Mike, where you at?

1:05:14.744 --> 1:05:16.613
You a friend of me or
are you friend of them?

1:05:18.748 --> 1:05:20.784
- I used to be friends
with Ian and his brother.

1:05:20.784 --> 1:05:24.054
Well, I guess Ian
sent someone else.

1:05:24.054 --> 1:05:25.322
Where is Iris?
