00:02.733 --> 00:04.075
(siren wailing)
(Meredith)
HERE'S WHAT I LEARNED

00:04.075 --> 00:06.037
MY FIRST DAY
AT MEDICAL SCHOOL--

00:06.037 --> 00:09.310
THINK LONG AND HARD BEFORE
CHOOSING TO BECOME A SURGEON.
(alarm beeping)

00:09.310 --> 00:12.213
(click, beeping stops)
IT TAKES 100% COMMITMENT.

00:12.213 --> 00:15.416
(alarm beeping)
(gasps and grunts)

00:15.416 --> 00:17.588
(strained voice)
THIS IS KILLING ME.
(beeping stops)

00:17.588 --> 00:20.491
(grunts)
(inhales deeply)

00:20.491 --> 00:22.793
I NEED COFFEE.

00:22.793 --> 00:26.227
FOUR DAYS BACK TO WORK,
AND I'M READY TO END IT ALL.

00:26.227 --> 00:29.100
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW WE SURVIVE FOUR DAYS.

00:29.100 --> 00:30.731
(Callie) COFFEE'S ON!
THAT'S HOW.

00:30.731 --> 00:32.333
YOU HAVE TO BE
ON YOUR "A" GAME

00:32.333 --> 00:35.366
EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU WALK
INTO THAT O.R.
(fusses)

00:35.366 --> 00:37.468
WHEN PATIENTS ARE LYING
ON YOUR TABLE

00:37.468 --> 00:39.110
COMPLETELY AT YOUR MERCY,

00:39.110 --> 00:41.312
THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT
WHEN YOU MAKE THAT FIRST CUT...

00:41.312 --> 00:44.145
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
(snip)

00:44.145 --> 00:45.816
(crying)

00:45.816 --> 00:49.120
NO OTHER SPECIALTY
REQUIRES THE TIME, THE FOCUS,

00:49.120 --> 00:51.422
THE COMPLETE DEDICATION...
(squeaks)

00:51.422 --> 00:54.555
EXCEPT MAYBE BEING A MOM.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.658
OKAY, SO DADDY IS GONNA
DROP YOU OFF AT DAY CARE,

00:57.658 --> 00:59.590
AND I AM GOING
TO PICK YOU UP, OKAY?

00:59.590 --> 01:01.092
THEN WE'LL HAVE
A PRINCESS TEA PARTY

01:01.092 --> 01:02.533
AT THE END OF THE DAY.
OKAY, LADIES, LET'S GO.

01:02.533 --> 01:04.295
(Amanda Palmer's
"Ukulele Anthem" playing)

01:04.295 --> 01:05.796
WOW. WE'RE GOOD AT THIS.

01:05.796 --> 01:07.668
OH, PUMP!

01:07.668 --> 01:08.699
YEAH.
OH!

01:08.699 --> 01:10.271
OKAY. MWAH!
MWAH.

01:10.271 --> 01:13.073
♪ BRING YOUR ETCH A SKETCH
TO WORK ♪

01:13.073 --> 01:15.146
MAYBE WE'RE TOO GOOD AT THIS.

JAMES EVANS, 57,
POST-OP DAY 6

01:19.710 --> 01:22.283
FROM AN EMERGENT TRICUSPID
VALVE REPLACEMENT

01:22.283 --> 01:25.186
DUE TO ENDOCARDITIS.
HEY, COULD YOU CHANGE IT
TO "JIMMY"?

01:25.186 --> 01:26.687
AND GO AHEAD AND FIX THE AGE,
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,

01:26.687 --> 01:29.160
TO SOMETHING IN THE 40s.
(elevator bell dings)

01:29.160 --> 01:31.322
(chuckles)
DEEP BREATH.

01:31.322 --> 01:33.624
IS THAT THING YOU PUT IN THERE
STILL WORKING?
I THINK YOU'RE GOOD.

01:33.624 --> 01:35.396
THE NEW VALVE SHOULD LAST
10 TO 15 YEARS.

01:35.396 --> 01:36.497
DR. WILSON'S GOING TO DO

01:36.497 --> 01:37.868
A TREADMILL STRESS
ECHOCARDIOGRAM

01:37.868 --> 01:40.131
JUST TO BE THOROUGH.
THANKS, DOC.

01:40.131 --> 01:41.572
ANYTHING TO GET ME
OUT OF THIS DRESS.

01:41.572 --> 01:43.234
(chuckles)
OKAY.

01:43.234 --> 01:44.875
(cell phone chimes)

01:44.875 --> 01:47.778
OH. U.N.O.S. HAS
A POSSIBLE MATCH

01:47.778 --> 01:49.180
ON ONE MY TRANSPLANT
PATIENTS.

01:49.180 --> 01:51.182
UH, PAGE ME WITH HIS RESULTS.
OKAY.

01:51.182 --> 01:54.885
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

01:54.885 --> 01:57.388
(indistinct conversations)

01:57.388 --> 01:59.450
LOOKING AT YOUR DAD'S CHART?
HE'S NOT MY DAD.

01:59.450 --> 02:01.652
THAT'S WHY I TOOK
MY MOM'S LAST NAME.

02:01.652 --> 02:04.255
SO THERE'S NOTHING
CONNECTING ME TO THE GUY.

02:04.255 --> 02:06.657
HE'S FUNNY.
YEAH?

02:06.657 --> 02:09.200
YOU SHOULD TALK TO HIM.
TELL HIM WHO YOU ARE.

02:09.200 --> 02:10.361
MAYBE HE'S CHANGED.
YOU'VE CHANGED.

02:10.361 --> 02:11.662
THE LAST TIME I SAW
HIS FACE,

02:11.662 --> 02:14.405
I WAS PUNCHING HIM SO HARD,
I COULD HAVE KILLED HIM.

02:14.405 --> 02:17.608
I'M JUST AFRAID I'LL PICK UP
WHERE I LEFT OFF.

02:17.608 --> 02:19.910
(woman speaking indistinctly
over. P.A.)

02:19.910 --> 02:21.372
(Meredith) HEY!

02:21.372 --> 02:23.744
YOU'RE DOING A HEART/LIVER
ON SAMANTHA CALDER?
YEP.

02:23.744 --> 02:24.815
I SAW HER BEFORE
I WENT ON LEAVE.

02:24.815 --> 02:26.317
I'M THE ONE WHO DIAGNOSED

02:26.317 --> 02:27.618
THE FAMILIAL
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA.

02:27.618 --> 02:29.850
OH, WELL, YOU WERE RIGHT.
SO LET ME TAKE THE LIVER.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.682
REALLY?
(chuckles) YEAH, REALLY.

02:31.682 --> 02:33.424
WHY DIDN'T YOU THINK OF ME
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

02:33.424 --> 02:35.186
I GUESS I THOUGHT
YOU WERE EASING BACK IN?

02:35.186 --> 02:37.358
I DON'T EASE BACK IN.
I JUMP IN THE DEEP END.

02:37.358 --> 02:39.560
I SWIM.
ALL RIGHT.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.532
UH, WELL, HAVE YOU READ
THE CLEVELAND ARTICLE

02:41.532 --> 02:43.894
ON SIMULTANEOUS HEART/LIVER
TRANSPLANTS UNDER C.P.B.?

02:43.894 --> 02:46.237
I HAVE NOT. IS IT DIFFERENT
FROM A REGULAR HEART/LIVER?

02:47.238 --> 02:49.300
I WILL READ IT.

02:49.300 --> 02:50.571
HEY, YOU'RE DOING
A HEART/LIVER?

02:50.571 --> 02:52.443
YEAH. UH,
BUT I DON'T NEED YOU.

02:52.443 --> 02:54.245
YOU PAGED ME.

02:54.245 --> 02:55.706
(elevator bell dings)

02:55.706 --> 02:57.648
YOU STOLE MY LIVER?

02:57.648 --> 03:00.551
UH... COME ON.
I DESERVE THIS.

03:00.551 --> 03:02.713
I'VE BEEN ON THE BENCH
FOR MONTHS.
YOU DESERVE NOTHING.

03:02.713 --> 03:05.185
I NAMED MY SON AFTER YOU.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.258
(singsongy)
YOU CAN'T BE MAD AT ME.

03:07.258 --> 03:08.319
YOUR SON IS
THE DEVIL'S SPAWN.

03:08.319 --> 03:10.361
HE DRINKS THE MILK
OF A LIVER THIEF!

03:10.361 --> 03:12.323
(indistinct conversations)

03:12.323 --> 03:13.624
MORNING, DR. KEPNER,

03:13.624 --> 03:15.195
DR. ROBBINS.
MM. HI.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.197
COFFEE? I THOUGHT
YOU COULD USE IT

03:17.197 --> 03:18.929
BEFORE YOUR BIG SURGERY
WITH DR. SHEPHERD.

03:18.929 --> 03:20.331
OH.

03:20.331 --> 03:22.202
THAT'S... NICE.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.774
(elevator bell dings)
(chuckles)

03:23.774 --> 03:25.976
(indistinct conversations)

03:25.976 --> 03:28.339
WHAT DID I DO?

03:28.339 --> 03:30.441
SOMETHING NICE, APPARENTLY.
I DIDN'T GET A COFFEE.

03:30.441 --> 03:33.244
NO.

03:33.244 --> 03:37.448
NO. I THINK I ACTUALLY DID
SOMETHING REALLY, REALLY BAD.

03:37.448 --> 03:39.420
I THINK THAT I BROUGHT HER
BACK TO MY APARTMENT

03:39.420 --> 03:41.652
THE NIGHT OF THE GALA.
YOU THINK?

03:41.652 --> 03:42.723
I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS DRUNK.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.255
I BARELY REMEMBER
EVEN GETTING HOME.

03:44.255 --> 03:45.656
AND THEN I HAVE A VAGUE MEMORY
OF HER IN MY KITCHEN.

03:45.656 --> 03:46.957
AND NOW SHE'S BEING
REALLY FRIENDLY.

03:46.957 --> 03:48.629
DID I FLIRT WITH HER
THAT NIGHT?

03:48.629 --> 03:51.231
UH, ALL I REMEMBER

03:51.231 --> 03:53.434
IS WAKING UP IN MY BATHTUB
WITH MY SPANX STILL ON.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.965
OH, WELL, AT LEAST
WE KNOW YOU'RE GOOD.

03:54.965 --> 03:58.409
(sighs) OH.

03:58.409 --> 04:01.312
HEY, UM, SOME MORTGAGE SLIPS
FOR THE APARTMENT CAME.

04:01.312 --> 04:03.013
OH.
(chuckles)

04:03.013 --> 04:04.375
OKAY.

04:04.375 --> 04:05.546
YOU'RE WELCOME.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.878
(elevator bell dings)

04:07.878 --> 04:09.320
YOU WANT ME TO THANK YOU
FOR GIVING ME

04:09.320 --> 04:10.981
THE MORTGAGE SLIPS
TO MY APARTMENT

04:10.981 --> 04:12.423
THAT YOU'RE LIVING IN?

04:12.423 --> 04:14.725
LISTEN, IF YOU WANT ME
TO MOVE OUT, JUST SAY SO.

04:14.725 --> 04:15.886
I DON'T WANT TO LIVE
IN THE APARTMENT

04:15.886 --> 04:16.987
THAT I SHARED
WITH MY CHEATING WIFE.

04:16.987 --> 04:18.959
I GOTTA GO. THANKS!

04:18.959 --> 04:21.362
(telephone rings in distance)

04:22.593 --> 04:25.296
(grunts)
(door closes)

04:25.296 --> 04:26.667
(groans)

04:26.667 --> 04:28.939
(strained voice)
I THINK I OVERSLEPT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

04:28.939 --> 04:30.801
(inhales deeply) OF?

04:30.801 --> 04:32.903
MY SHIRT?
YES.

04:32.903 --> 04:34.044
YOU'RE INTRODUCING ME
TO YOUR MOTHER.

04:34.044 --> 04:35.576
I NEED TO MAKE
A GOOD IMPRESSION,

04:35.576 --> 04:37.478
SO I AM GOING FOR,

04:37.478 --> 04:39.580
"YES, I AM AN INTERN
DATING YOUR SON

04:39.580 --> 04:42.453
"WHO IS A FELLOW AND A MEMBER
OF THE BOARD AND AN AVERY.

04:42.453 --> 04:45.055
"BUT BEFORE YOU WRITE ME OFF
AS A GOLD DIGGER,

04:45.055 --> 04:47.758
"YOU NEED TO KNOW
I AM A KICK-ASS SURGEON,

04:47.758 --> 04:49.890
AND YOUR SON IS LUCKY
TO BE DATING ME."

04:49.890 --> 04:51.692
THAT IS A LOT OF PRESSURE
TO PUT ON A SHIRT.

04:51.692 --> 04:53.324
OH, IT'S NOT WORKING ALONE.

04:53.324 --> 04:55.466
THERE'S A LIP GLOSS
IN MY LOCKER THAT'LL ASSIST.

04:55.466 --> 04:56.867
(whispers) OH, YEAH.

04:56.867 --> 04:57.898
(normal voice)
WELL, SHE IS GONNA LOVE YOU.

04:57.898 --> 05:00.601
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

05:00.601 --> 05:02.773
MM. NOT--NOT HERE.
HMM?

05:02.773 --> 05:04.004
WHAT?
STOP.
WE'RE NOT THOSE PEOPLE.

05:04.004 --> 05:06.337
OH, I KNOW. YEAH.

05:06.337 --> 05:07.608
(laughs)

05:07.608 --> 05:10.681
(gasps) BANANA BREAD.

05:10.681 --> 05:11.882
I'M STARVING...
(mouth full) MMM.
(foil crinkles)

05:11.882 --> 05:13.484
(mouth full) HELP YOURSELF.

05:13.484 --> 05:16.647
(mouth full) I WAS TOO BUSY
FEEDING MY FAMILY BREAKFAST

05:16.647 --> 05:18.419
AND GETTING MY SISTER WIFE'S
BREAST PUMP PACKED

05:18.419 --> 05:22.092
TO FEED MYSELF
THIS MORNING. SO...
YOU HAVE A SISTER WIFE?

05:22.092 --> 05:23.924
DEREK AND MEREDITH AND I
ARE IN A RELATIONSHIP.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.325
HUH.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.657
I USED TO DANCE
IN MY UNDERWEAR.

05:26.657 --> 05:28.459
AND I THOUGHT I'D GET BACK
TO THAT WHEN I LEFT ARIZONA.

05:28.459 --> 05:30.361
INSTEAD I WALKED RIGHT
INTO "BIG LOVE."

05:30.361 --> 05:32.463
(chuckles)
I REBOUNDED
TO THE McDREAMYS.

05:32.463 --> 05:34.835
(cell phones ring)
MM.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.107
HMM, HANG GLIDER TRAUMA?
YEAH.

05:37.107 --> 05:39.009
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?
IT'S AMAZING.
(crinkles)

05:39.009 --> 05:40.010
IT'S GOOD, RIGHT?
MM-HMM.

05:40.010 --> 05:41.512
EMMA MADE IT.
MMM.

05:41.512 --> 05:43.644
FETAL SURGEON EMMA
FROM THE GALA?
MM-HMM.

05:43.644 --> 05:46.346
OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE REBOUNDING, TOO.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.018
MM.
(chuckles) YEAH.

05:48.018 --> 05:51.582
WHAT HAVE WE GOT?
HER NAME IS REESE WOODS, 22.

05:51.582 --> 05:53.353
HANG GLIDING OVER
TIGER MOUNTAIN,

05:53.353 --> 05:55.586
B.P.'s 100/70,
OPEN TIBIA FRACTURE,

05:55.586 --> 05:57.388
AND COMPLAINS OF ABDOMINAL PAIN.

05:57.388 --> 05:58.929
CAN I SAY, "I TOLD YOU SO,"
NOW, REESE?

05:58.929 --> 06:00.691
WHO'S THIS?

06:00.691 --> 06:02.132
OH, THAT'S DONNA.
SHE'S THE SISTER.
MM.

06:02.132 --> 06:04.064
ALTHOUGH SHE ACTS LIKE
SHE'S MY MOTHER.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.396
I AM NOT DOING THIS AGAIN.

06:05.396 --> 06:07.438
I'M NOT WATCHING YOU
TRY TO KILL YOURSELF.

06:07.438 --> 06:09.139
IT'S JUST A LITTLE BREAK.
DON'T BE SO MAD.

06:09.139 --> 06:10.140
OKAY, THIS ISN'T BONE.
THIS IS A ROD.
(groans)

06:10.140 --> 06:12.042
WHEN DID YOU HAVE
THIS ROD PUT IN?

06:12.042 --> 06:14.875
THIS MARCH. SHE BROKE IT
HELI-SKIING IN NEW ZEALAND.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.977
SHE'S ALSO BROKEN, UH,
BOTH FOREARMS,

06:16.977 --> 06:19.009
LOST A KIDNEY,
DISLOCATED HER SHOULDER,

06:19.009 --> 06:20.411
WOW, YOU REALLY DO HAVE
A DEATH WISH, HUH?

06:20.411 --> 06:22.453
I GUESS I'M JUST
MAKING UP FOR LOST TIME.

06:22.453 --> 06:23.914
I'M SEEING A LOT OF FREE FLUID
IN MORRISON'S POUCH.

06:23.914 --> 06:25.786
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO GET HER
UP TO C.T. STAT.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.120
OKAY, NOW SHOW CATHERINE
YOUR PARTY TRICK, SIR.

06:30.120 --> 06:33.093
(grunting)

06:35.896 --> 06:38.398
(groans)
YEAH.

06:38.398 --> 06:42.172
OH! OH, HE'S ACTING ALL
TOO COOL FOR SCHOOL RIGHT NOW.
(grunts)

06:42.172 --> 06:45.175
(chuckles) BUT YESTERDAY,
WHEN HE MADE IT TO THE CHAIR,

06:45.175 --> 06:47.878
HE WAS SMILING
FROM EAR-TO-EAR.

06:47.878 --> 06:49.540
OKAY, OKAY.
OKAY.

06:49.540 --> 06:50.941
OH!
(grunts)

06:50.941 --> 06:52.082
YOU ARE DOING SO WELL!

06:52.082 --> 06:54.445
I THINK YOU'LL BE DOING
LAPS BY NEXT WEEK.

06:54.445 --> 06:58.519
EXCUSE ME, SIR. YOUR, UH, DRAIN
OUTPUT HAS BEEN A LITTLE LOW,

06:58.519 --> 07:01.421
AND WE WERE TOLD TO COME BY
TO STRIP YOUR J.P.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.494
WE CAN COME BACK LATER
IF THIS ISN'T A GOOD TIME.

07:03.494 --> 07:06.797
WELL, I ACTUALLY WANTED
TO TALK WITH DR. BAILEY.

07:06.797 --> 07:09.029
SO RIGHT NOW IS A GREAT TIME.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.904
I NEED A HAND
TO GET BACK IN BED.

07:13.904 --> 07:16.206
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU TWO
WAITING FOR? HELP THE MAN!

07:16.206 --> 07:17.668
OH, YEAH.
OF COURSE.

07:17.668 --> 07:20.110
(Richard grunts)
OKAY.

07:20.110 --> 07:21.842
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

07:21.842 --> 07:24.214
(sighs)
I WAS EXPECTING MORE.

07:26.216 --> 07:28.018
BUT HE COULDN'T SIT UP
TWO DAYS AGO.

07:28.018 --> 07:29.620
HE'S DEPRESSED.

07:29.620 --> 07:32.122
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
ANTIDEPRESSANTS?
OF COURSE I HAVE.

07:32.122 --> 07:35.155
AND HE REFUSES.
HE SAYS HE'S FINE, AND HE IS.

07:35.155 --> 07:38.759
HE NEEDS TIME, SUPPORT,
AND MORE PILLOWS

07:38.759 --> 07:40.591
IF HE'S EVER GONNA BE ABLE
TO SIT UP COMFORTABLY.

07:40.591 --> 07:42.062
I'M GONNA GO GET THOSE.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.665
MIRANDA... I'M SO SORRY.

07:44.665 --> 07:48.068
YOU'VE DONE SO MUCH,
AND I AM GRATEFUL.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.601
I'M HERE TO HELP.
SO LET ME.

07:50.601 --> 07:52.643
(sighs) ALL RIGHT.

07:52.643 --> 07:54.675
PILLOWS.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.947
(indistinct conversations)

07:56.947 --> 07:58.649
(gasps) OH, MY GOD!

07:58.649 --> 08:01.081
OH...

08:01.081 --> 08:02.182
(clears throat) HI.

08:02.182 --> 08:06.086
JACKSON...
WHERE ARE YOUR MANNERS?

08:06.086 --> 08:08.559
MOM, THIS IS STEPHANIE EDWARDS.

08:08.559 --> 08:11.021
STEPH, THIS IS MY MOM.
(sighs)

08:11.021 --> 08:14.064
DEAR, WOULD YOU MIND
HANDING ME THE PILLOWS

08:14.064 --> 08:15.766
FROM THE TOP BUNK?

08:15.766 --> 08:18.569
(telephone ringing in distance)

08:18.569 --> 08:20.200
(pillows rustle)

08:21.632 --> 08:23.033
OKAY.

08:23.033 --> 08:24.635
MM.

08:26.537 --> 08:28.038
(door slams)

08:28.038 --> 08:38.188
I DON'T THINK
SHE LIKED MY SHIRT.
MM.

08:41.151 --> 08:42.252
MA, HOLD ON.
YOU ARE AWARE THAT

08:42.252 --> 08:43.293
YOU'RE ON THE BOARD
OF THIS HOSPITAL,

08:43.293 --> 08:45.796
AS WELL AS AN AVERY.

08:45.796 --> 08:48.028
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
I WENT THROUGH

08:48.028 --> 08:49.660
TO GET THESE PILLOWS.
MEANT TO LOCK THE DOOR.

08:49.660 --> 08:51.732
GOOD MORNING, SIR.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING TODAY?

08:51.732 --> 08:53.634
HE'S A MESS.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.535
WHO TAPED THIS I.V.?

08:55.535 --> 08:58.038
IT'S FINE.
MAYBE IT WAS EDWARDS.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.010
HER MIND'S OBVIOUSLY
NOT ON PATIENT CARE.

09:00.010 --> 09:02.573
THAT IS NOT FAIR, MOM.
THIS IS NOT ME BEING
A PRUDE.

09:02.573 --> 09:04.745
I LIKE SEX JUST AS MUCH
AS THE NEXT PERSON.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.917
OH, GOD, PLEASE.
BUT THERE IS A TIME
AND THERE'S A PLACE.

09:06.917 --> 09:10.020
HE SAID HE MEANT
TO LOCK THE DOOR.
YOU BE QUIET.

09:10.020 --> 09:11.822
WHERE ARE
YOUR COMPRESSION SOCKS?

09:11.822 --> 09:13.253
THEY WENT TO GET ANOTHER PAIR.

09:13.253 --> 09:16.056
MAYBE THEY GOT DISTRACTED
BY EDWARDS' BREASTS.
AND I'M OUT.

09:16.056 --> 09:19.189
I'M JUST LOOKING OUT
FOR YOU.

09:19.189 --> 09:21.792
(New Age music playing)
HEY, SAM.

09:21.792 --> 09:24.094
DR. GREY...
WHERE'S YOUR BABY BELLY?

09:24.094 --> 09:25.836
IT TURNED INTO
A BABY BOY.

09:25.836 --> 09:27.838
(sighs) CONGRATULATIONS.

09:27.838 --> 09:29.740
I WOULD SHOW YOU A PICTURE,
BUT HE'S SO CUTE,

09:29.740 --> 09:31.642
YOU MAY HAVE ANOTHER
HEART ATTACK.

09:31.642 --> 09:32.903
(chuckles) OH.
(chuckles)

09:32.903 --> 09:34.945
SHE'S HAD A BUNCH OF THEM.
NOT RECENTLY, THOUGH.

09:34.945 --> 09:37.577
I THINK THE YOGA MUSIC HELPS.
ABSOLUTELY.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.780
HE HATES THE MUSIC.
I LOVED IT...

09:39.780 --> 09:41.351
HMM-HMM.
FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS.

09:41.351 --> 09:44.314
(chuckles)
WELL, NOW THAT WE'RE GETTING YOU
A NEW HEART AND LIVER,

09:44.314 --> 09:45.686
YOU CAN FLIP OUT
LIKE THE REST OF US.

09:45.686 --> 09:48.088
(chuckles) AND HAVE A BABY,
LIKE DR. GREY.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.191
OR BE A GROUND-BREAKING SURGEON,
LIKE DR. YANG.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.293
I'M A SURGEON, TOO.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.595
OH, YEAH. OF COURSE.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.127
DR. GREY DOES IT ALL.

09:57.127 --> 09:59.599
IT'S SO IMPRESSIVE.

09:59.599 --> 10:03.103
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU HANDLE EVERYTHING.
I DON'T KNOW EITHER SOMETIMES.

10:03.103 --> 10:06.336
(telephone ringing in distance)

10:06.336 --> 10:08.839
WHAT?
DID YOU WANT TO EXAMINE
THE PATIENT?

10:08.839 --> 10:10.080
OH.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.313
(indistinct conversations)

10:13.313 --> 10:16.616
HELLO, MR. SAMUELS.
I'M DR. EDWARDS.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.188
IT SAYS HERE YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN ABLE TO URINATE

10:18.188 --> 10:20.050
SINCE YESTERDAY.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

10:20.050 --> 10:21.992
WOW--WOW.

10:21.992 --> 10:24.094
UH, IT'S NO WONDER
YOU CAN'T URINATE.

10:24.094 --> 10:25.996
YOUR PENIS IS QUITE SWOLLEN.

10:25.996 --> 10:27.197
I THINK I GOT A BUG BITE.

10:27.197 --> 10:29.029
THAT'S A BIG BUG BITE.

10:29.029 --> 10:32.332
IT'S... MORE OF A BEE STING
THAN A BUG BITE.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.104
STILL PRETTY SWOLLEN
FOR A BEE STING.

10:34.104 --> 10:36.066
DO YOU HAVE
A HISTORY OF ALLERGIES?

10:36.066 --> 10:37.738
IT WASN'T REALLY ONE BEE.
IT WAS SEVERAL.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.069
WELL, WHAT'S SEVERAL?

10:39.069 --> 10:41.742
I DON'T KNOW...

10:41.742 --> 10:43.674
25? 30?

10:43.674 --> 10:44.975
30 BEES?

10:44.975 --> 10:46.947
I KNOW. IT'S CRAZY, RIGHT?

10:46.947 --> 10:48.819
HMM?
BUT SEE, IT WAS SATURDAY,

10:48.819 --> 10:50.951
AND WE HAVE THIS HAMMOCK
IN THE BACKYARD.

10:50.951 --> 10:52.282
AND I THOUGHT I'D MAKE
SOME LUNCH.

10:52.282 --> 10:59.059
SO I TOOK MY PANTS OFF
AND... MADE A HONEY SANDWICH.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.361
WH--A HONEY SANDWICH?

11:01.361 --> 11:03.193
PEANUT BUTTER AND HONEY
SANDWICH.

11:03.193 --> 11:04.965
'CAUSE WHO EATS
A HONEY SANDWICH, RIGHT?

11:04.965 --> 11:07.197
(chuckles) RIGHT.
AND I WAS EATING
THE HONEY SANDWICH.

11:07.197 --> 11:10.941
AND I FELL ASLEEP. AND I GUESS
I GOT SOME HONEY ON...

11:10.941 --> 11:13.103
MYSELF.

11:14.044 --> 11:17.077
AND THE BEES CAUGHT
THE SCENT.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.448
OKAY.

11:18.448 --> 11:20.110
MM-HMM.

11:20.110 --> 11:23.053
WELL, I'M GONNA GET YOU
A DOSE OF I.V. BENADRYL

11:23.053 --> 11:24.414
AND A STEROID.

11:24.414 --> 11:26.116
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
A CATHETER SO YOU CAN PEE.

11:26.116 --> 11:27.357
DR. EDWARDS.

11:27.357 --> 11:30.090
WOULD IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE
IF IT WERE HORNETS?

11:32.692 --> 11:34.364
(Derek) THE PATIENT
IS A 14-YEAR-OLD MALE...

11:34.364 --> 11:37.868
(continues indistinctly)

11:37.868 --> 11:39.169
ALL RIGHT, ONE SECOND.
EXCUSE ME.

11:39.169 --> 11:42.102
(indistinct conversations)

11:42.102 --> 11:44.134
FOURTH DAY BACK,
AND I'M ALREADY SCRUBBING IN

11:44.134 --> 11:46.076
ON A HEART/LIVER TRANSPLANT
WITH CRISTINA.

11:46.076 --> 11:47.207
WELL, FANTASTIC!
YEAH.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.438
CAN YOU PICK UP THE KIDS
THIS AFTERNOON?

11:48.438 --> 11:50.140
I WOULD, BUT I HAVE
TO ENTERTAIN ALL OF THEM.

11:50.140 --> 11:52.943
THEY'RE VISITING NEUROSURGEONS
WATCHING MY A.V.M.

11:52.943 --> 11:55.045
Q&A AFTER.
I PROMISED ZOLA
A PRINCESS TEA PARTY.

11:55.045 --> 11:57.047
HAVE CALLIE DO TEA.

11:57.047 --> 11:59.119
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ME,
OR IN A PINCH, YOU.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.250
IT'S SO SHE KNOWS THAT

12:00.250 --> 12:02.152
SHE HASN'T BEEN REPLACED
IN OUR HEARTS

12:02.152 --> 12:04.895
BY A NEW BABY BROTHER
OR BY A MULTI-ORGAN TRANSPLANT.

12:04.895 --> 12:06.396
IT'S AN OVER-DETERMINED
TEA PARTY.

12:06.396 --> 12:08.929
(sighs)
I'LL TALK TO CALLIE.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.300
(telephone ringing in distance)

12:10.300 --> 12:13.233
(whirring)
(panting)

12:13.233 --> 12:16.006
(beeps)
I DIDN'T REALIZE
I'D HAVE TO WORK THIS HARD

12:16.006 --> 12:18.208
TO GET OUT OF HERE.
FIVE MORE MINUTES.

12:18.208 --> 12:21.011
I LOST OUT ON THREE GIGS
SINCE I'VE BEEN IN HERE.

12:21.011 --> 12:22.943
IF I CAN PLAY TONIGHT,

12:22.943 --> 12:24.314
MAYBE THIS TRIP
WON'T BE A TOTAL WASH.

12:24.314 --> 12:26.777
DO YOU HAVE ANY FAMILY
OR ANYONE I CAN CALL

12:26.777 --> 12:29.079
TO COME PICK YOU UP?
NO, I'M GOOD.

12:31.782 --> 12:34.885
HOW ABOUT I MAKE A CALL
TO A REHAB CLINIC?

12:34.885 --> 12:37.157
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT ME,
DARLIN'.

12:37.157 --> 12:39.029
I KNOW I HAD SOME JUNK IN
MY SYSTEM WHEN I CAME IN HERE,

12:39.029 --> 12:40.490
BUT I'M A RECREATIONAL USER.

12:40.490 --> 12:42.963
YOUR LEFT ARM, RIGHT ARM,
AND THE BACKS OF BOTH YOUR KNEES

12:42.963 --> 12:44.294
TELL A DIFFERENT STORY.

12:44.294 --> 12:46.536
IT TOOK MY HALF AN HOUR
TO FIND A USABLE VEIN ON YOU.

12:46.536 --> 12:48.138
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO
WHEN YOU LEAVE HERE.

12:48.138 --> 12:50.100
(exhales deeply) I'VE GOT PEOPLE
I CAN CALL. I GOT FAMILY.

12:50.100 --> 12:52.242
I DON'T THINK YOU DO.
OR MAYBE YOU DID,

12:52.242 --> 12:54.004
BUT I THINK THAT
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN NOW.

12:54.004 --> 12:57.207
(chuckles) WELL, YOU KNOW
ALL ABOUT ME, DON'T YOU?

12:57.207 --> 13:01.081
I KNOW THAT WE HAVE YOU
ON METHADONE RIGHT NOW,

13:01.081 --> 13:02.813
WHICH IS A BIG STEP
TOWARDS RECOVERY.

13:02.813 --> 13:04.214
LET'S JUST TRY
TO KEEP IT GOING SOMEWHERE--

13:04.214 --> 13:07.517
KID, I PLAY BLUES GUITAR.

13:07.517 --> 13:09.920
I'M NOT CHRISTINA AGUILERA.

13:09.920 --> 13:11.491
I CAN'T AFFORD THOSE PLACES,
NOT THE GOOD ONES.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.924
LET ME MAKE SOME CALLS
FOR YOU, PLEASE.

13:15.125 --> 13:17.067
BOY...

13:17.067 --> 13:19.830
YOU ARE AS PERSISTENT
AS YOU ARE ANNOYING.

13:19.830 --> 13:23.133
YOU CAN WALK AS FAST
AS YOU WANT,

13:23.133 --> 13:24.304
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.037
NEITHER AM I.
(sighs)

13:27.037 --> 13:28.438
(chuckles)

13:28.438 --> 13:30.080
WHAT IS WRONG WITH CALLIE?
SHE STILL HASN'T CALLED ME BACK.

13:30.080 --> 13:32.012
(cell phone chimes)
OOH! OOH!

13:32.012 --> 13:33.483
AH, THE RECOVERY TEAM
TEXTED,

13:33.483 --> 13:35.115
TWO MINUTES UNTIL
THEY OPEN THE DONOR.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.887
HEY, ROSS? COULD YOU RUN DOWN

13:36.887 --> 13:39.089
TO THE E.R. AND ASK TORRES IF
SHE CAN PICK UP THE KIDS TODAY?

13:39.089 --> 13:40.550
SURE, BUT I HAVE TO GET
THIS BLOOD TO THE LAB--

13:40.550 --> 13:42.522
AND REMIND HER ABOUT
THE PRINCESS TEA PARTY.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.424
IT HAS TO BE TODAY.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.396
(sighs)
WELL, THAT'S PRETTY COOL.

13:46.396 --> 13:47.527
THE TEA PARTY? YEAH.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.059
I MEAN, IT'S JUST
APPLE JUICE AND COOKIES,

13:49.059 --> 13:50.430
BUT SHE'S EXCITED ABOUT IT.

13:50.430 --> 13:51.962
NOT THE TEA PARTY.

13:51.962 --> 13:53.934
YOU AND ME DOING
GROUND-BREAKING SURGERY--

13:53.934 --> 13:55.305
THAT WAS THE IDEA
WHEN WE STARTED.

13:55.305 --> 13:57.437
YEAH. IT'S PRETTY COOL.

13:59.009 --> 14:01.341
DO YOU NEED TO GO PUMP?
NO, I'M FINE.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.043
YOU'RE HOLDING YOUR BOOBS.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.345
BUT WE'RE HAVING A MOMENT.
I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL IT.

14:05.345 --> 14:09.319
MER... YOUR BOOBS
ARE EXPLODING. GO PUMP.
THANK YOU.

14:09.319 --> 14:11.021
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

14:11.021 --> 14:12.482
(sighs)

14:12.482 --> 14:14.584
SO SHE MIGHT LOSE
THE KIDNEY?
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, LET'S--

14:14.584 --> 14:16.856
LET'S NOT JUMP AHEAD.
NO, PLEASE.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.889
WORST-CASE SCENARIO.
I LIKE TO BE PREPARED.

14:18.889 --> 14:21.131
WELL, THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO
IS SHE NEEDS A KIDNEY.

14:21.131 --> 14:23.363
SO WE START
TO LOOK FOR A DONOR.

14:23.363 --> 14:26.336
(sobbing)

14:26.336 --> 14:28.038
(voice breaking) OKAY.
WELL, THAT'S ME.

14:28.038 --> 14:31.201
I'M HER DONOR.
SO YOU'VE BEEN
THROUGH THIS BEFORE?

14:31.201 --> 14:34.604
OH, YEAH. YEAH.
TAKE YOUR PICK...

14:34.604 --> 14:38.008
BONE MARROW, BLOOD,
UH, LIVER,

14:38.008 --> 14:39.609
ANYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF,
I'VE GIVEN.

14:39.609 --> 14:41.181
WHAT'S MINE IS HERS.

14:41.181 --> 14:43.954
EXCEPT I HAVEN'T GIVEN
A KIDNEY YET. SO...

14:43.954 --> 14:45.155
YAY! (chuckles)

14:45.155 --> 14:46.216
SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S EXTREMELY
ACCIDENT-PRONE,

14:46.216 --> 14:47.988
MM.
EVEN FOR A DAREDEVIL.
(chuckles)

14:47.988 --> 14:51.061
NO. ALL THE PARACHUTING
AND STUFF--

14:51.061 --> 14:53.924
IT STARTED WHEN
SHE WENT INTO REMISSION.

14:53.924 --> 14:56.026
MY SISTER WAS DIAGNOSED
WITH APLASTIC ANEMIA

14:56.026 --> 14:58.268
WHEN SHE WAS 2.
WELL, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN HARD.

14:58.268 --> 14:59.970
IT WAS LUCKY
THAT YOU WERE A MATCH.

14:59.970 --> 15:01.932
OH, IT WASN'T LUCK.

15:01.932 --> 15:03.133
I'M A DONOR BABY.

15:03.133 --> 15:05.235
YOU'RE HER YOUNGER SISTER.

15:05.235 --> 15:06.636
YEAH.

15:06.636 --> 15:09.139
MY PARENTS ONLY HAD ME
TO SAVE HER.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.650
AAH! (grunting)

15:20.650 --> 15:22.192
(lowered voice)
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

15:22.192 --> 15:24.494
(lowered voice)
IT'S A LONG STORY.

15:24.494 --> 15:26.496
CAN YOU SEE ANY ACCESS
TO GET THE CATHETER IN?

15:26.496 --> 15:28.158
NO, IT'S TOO SWOLLEN.

15:28.158 --> 15:30.030
IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS MAULED
BY A PISSED OFF BADGER.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.601
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE
THE I.V. BENADRYL KICKED IN.

15:31.601 --> 15:33.463
(groaning) AAH!

15:33.463 --> 15:36.166
WE NEED TO GET SOMEONE
FROM UROLOGY DOWN HERE NOW.

15:36.166 --> 15:38.608
DON'T YOU THINK I TRIED?
THERE'S AN EMERGENCY,

15:38.608 --> 15:41.241
AND THE ON-CALL GUY
IS 20 MINUTES AWAY.
(groaning continues)

15:41.241 --> 15:43.613
(strained voice) DR. WILSON,
IT FEELS LIKE I MIGHT EXPLODE.

15:43.613 --> 15:45.575
I DON'T THINK HE'S GONNA
LAST 20 MINUTES.

15:45.575 --> 15:47.417
(babbles indistinctly)

15:49.449 --> 15:51.621
(knocks on door)
DR. AVERY, I'M--

15:51.621 --> 15:52.983
DARLING, SAVE YOUR BREATH.

15:52.983 --> 15:55.285
THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN SAY
AFTER THIS MORNING

15:55.285 --> 15:57.287
TO GET IN MY GOOD GRACES.
I HAVE A GIANT PENIS.

15:57.287 --> 15:58.328
(elevator bell dings)

15:58.328 --> 16:00.190
NO, NOT ME.
I DON'T HAVE A GI--

16:00.190 --> 16:02.432
I'M A GIRL. UH...
I HAVE A PATIENT,

16:02.432 --> 16:04.494
AND HE HAS A GIANT PENIS.

16:04.494 --> 16:06.636
IT'S THE BIGGEST ONE

24:28.498 --> 24:29.999
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL SET UP.

24:29.999 --> 24:31.501
AND THEY'RE GONNA COME
GET YOU TOMORROW--

24:31.501 --> 24:34.203
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
WHAT IS YOUR DEAL HERE?

24:34.203 --> 24:35.705
I MEAN,
YOU PULL YOUR STRINGS

24:35.705 --> 24:37.777
FOR EVERY ITINERATE JUNKIE
MUSICIAN THAT SHOWS UP?

24:37.777 --> 24:39.509
(plastic bag rustles)
YOU SAID THAT YOU WOULD GO
IF I SET IT UP.

24:39.509 --> 24:41.881
YOU SAID THAT YOU WOULD GO.
NO, SEE, I NEVER SAID THAT.

24:41.881 --> 24:44.884
THAT'S AGAINST MY POLICY.
THAT'S HOW YOU SCREW UP.

24:44.884 --> 24:46.255
YOU TELL SOMEONE
YOU'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING,

24:46.255 --> 24:48.618
YOU SET 'EM UP
FOR DISAPPOINTMENT.

24:50.159 --> 24:52.261
THAT'S HOW YOU LOSE
YOUR HOME...

24:52.261 --> 24:55.064
YOUR FAMILY.
MAKE YOUR CHILDREN HATE YOU.

24:55.064 --> 24:58.227
LOOK, YOU'RE A SWEET KID,
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.

24:58.227 --> 25:01.531
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO LET YOU DOWN, TOO.

25:01.531 --> 25:03.873
ALL RIGHT?

25:03.873 --> 25:05.675
'CAUSE YOU'D NEVER LET ME
HEAR THE END OF IT,

25:05.675 --> 25:07.506
YOU DAMN NAG. (chuckles)

25:07.506 --> 25:09.709
(sniffles)

25:09.709 --> 25:12.181
JIMMY, IF YOU KEEP GOING
THE WAY THAT YOU ARE GOING--

25:12.181 --> 25:14.143
I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN...

25:15.745 --> 25:17.216
MORE THAN I CAN SAY.

25:19.819 --> 25:22.552
JUST TAKE CARE NOW.

25:22.552 --> 25:23.593
(object thuds)

25:29.298 --> 25:31.200
(telephone rings)

25:31.200 --> 25:32.802
YOU CAN HELP.

25:32.802 --> 25:35.204
OH, MY GOD.
HE'S LEAVING,
AND HE'S MISERABLE,

25:35.204 --> 25:37.206
AND HE'S FULL OF REGRET
ABOUT YOU.

25:37.206 --> 25:39.238
AND YOU'RE ANGRY.
AND YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN ANGRY.

25:39.238 --> 25:41.040
AND I THINK
THIS COULD HELP YOU, TOO.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.742
AND I THINK
IT'S YOUR LAST CHANCE

25:42.742 --> 25:44.614
BECAUSE HE'S GONNA GO
AND USE AGAIN,

25:44.614 --> 25:47.917
AND HE'S GONNA DIE.
LOOK, DON'T TALK TO ME
ABOUT THIS AGAIN.

25:47.917 --> 25:50.049
ALL RIGHT? EVER.

25:55.885 --> 25:59.058
OH, HOW'S ZOLA?
OH, SHE'LL BE FINE.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.761
ONCE GREY GETS DOWN THERE,
SHE'LL STITCH HER UP,

26:01.761 --> 26:04.133
AND BE BACK IN TIME
TO SCRUB IN.

26:04.133 --> 26:06.736
(monitor beeping erratically)
IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN!

26:06.736 --> 26:09.839
OH, SHE'S DESATTING.

26:09.839 --> 26:11.270
UH, I'M GONNA INTUBATE.

26:11.270 --> 26:14.103
PUSH 5 OF VERSED
AND 100 OF SUCCINYLCHOLINE.

26:14.103 --> 26:16.876
WHAT HAPPENED?
SHE'S GONE INTO
HEART FAILURE AGAIN.

26:16.876 --> 26:18.277
CHECK ON THE ORGANS
AND BOOK AN O.R.
(labored breathing)

26:18.277 --> 26:19.979
WE'RE BRING HER DOWN
AS SOON AS SHE'S INTUBATED.

26:19.979 --> 26:23.613
(erratic beeping continues)

26:26.956 --> 26:28.117
(siren wailing)

26:28.117 --> 26:30.660
(suction gurgling,
monitor beeping steadily)

26:30.660 --> 26:33.723
OKAY, GOT THAT CLOSED UP.

26:33.723 --> 26:36.996
NOW LET ME SEE.
DID I MISS ANYTHING ELSE?

26:36.996 --> 26:38.628
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

26:38.628 --> 26:40.029
THAT'S WHAT'S CALLED

26:40.029 --> 26:42.732
A RHETORICAL QUESTION,
MY DEAR.

26:42.732 --> 26:47.036
ALL RIGHT, LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS PENIS, SHALL WE?
MM.

26:47.036 --> 26:48.107
(suction gurgling)

26:48.107 --> 26:51.741
UH, DR. AVERY,
CAN YOU ELABORATE

26:51.741 --> 26:53.643
ON SOME OF
YOUR MORE INTERESTING CASES?

26:53.643 --> 26:55.645
I'M FASCINATED
BY ALL THINGS PENILE.

26:55.645 --> 26:58.718
YES, I SAW EVIDENCE OF THAT
EARLIER THIS MORNING.

26:58.718 --> 27:01.190
HOW'S IT LOOKING, DEAR?

27:01.190 --> 27:03.392
WELL, IT'S POSSIBLE HE'S GONNA
NEED A SKIN GRAFT,

27:03.392 --> 27:05.154
BUT NOTHING I CAN'T FIX.
MM-HMM.

27:05.154 --> 27:07.196
YEAH, HE'LL BE ABLE
TO STICK IT IN A HORNET'S NEST,

27:07.196 --> 27:10.299
AN ANT HILL, A TARANTULA'S...
WHEREVER THEY LIVE.

27:10.299 --> 27:12.962
WELL, I FIND THAT MEN OFTEN
PUT THEIR PENISES

27:12.962 --> 27:15.004
IN PLACES THAT
THEY DON'T BELONG.

27:15.004 --> 27:17.667
(instrument clanks)
MM-HMM.

27:17.667 --> 27:18.938
SUCTION, DEAR, COME ON.

27:18.938 --> 27:22.011
(suction gurgling)

27:22.011 --> 27:25.244
OKAY, SUPERGIRL.

27:25.244 --> 27:26.776
THAT'S THE ONLY OUCH-Y PART.

27:26.776 --> 27:29.018
NOW YOU'RE NOT GONNA FEEL
ANYTHING AT ALL.

27:29.018 --> 27:31.921
YOU ARE SO BRAVE.
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

27:31.921 --> 27:33.082
(cell phone chimes)

27:33.082 --> 27:35.885
(sighs) MY PATIENT'S
GOING INTO THE O.R.

27:35.885 --> 27:37.186
WHEN?
RIGHT NOW.

27:37.186 --> 27:39.058
IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE
FOR ANOTHER HOUR AT LEAST.

27:39.058 --> 27:40.159
WELL, GO AHEAD. UH...

27:40.159 --> 27:41.330
I'LL HAVE JENNA COME IN
AND HOLD HER.

27:41.330 --> 27:42.962
(lowered voice)
DOESN'T THAT SOUND

27:42.962 --> 27:45.865
A LITTLE ELLIS GREY TO YOU--
TO LEAVE MY KID TO GO TO SURGERY

27:45.865 --> 27:47.837
WHILE SHE'S GETTING
STITCHES?
YOU'RE A GOOD MOM, MER.

27:47.837 --> 27:48.998
TAKE IT FROM ME.
I HAD CRAP PARENTS.

27:48.998 --> 27:50.439
I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

27:50.439 --> 27:52.942
BESIDES, SHE'S NOT GONNA BE
ALONE. SHE'S GONNA BE WITH ME,

27:52.942 --> 27:55.004
WHO SHE LOVES MORE
THAN HER OWN PARENTS.

27:58.147 --> 28:00.109
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M DOING THIS.

28:00.109 --> 28:02.151
YEAH. CAN YOU SEND
JENNA IN HERE?

28:02.151 --> 28:03.883
LOOK, DON'T CRY,
OR SHE WILL.

28:03.883 --> 28:07.056
(beep)

28:07.056 --> 28:08.888
THE GENERAL SURGEONS
WEREN'T ABLE TO REPAIR

28:08.888 --> 28:12.361
YOUR SISTER'S KIDNEY,
SO... WE'RE GONNA--
LET'S JUST CUT TO THE CHASE.

28:12.361 --> 28:15.224
EVENTUALLY, SHE'S GOING
TO NEED A KIDNEY.

28:15.224 --> 28:16.365
RIGHT?

28:19.969 --> 28:22.031
(under breath) OKAY.

28:22.031 --> 28:24.703
(normal voice)
WELL, HERE I AM.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.937
OPEN THE TOOLBOX.
TAKE WHATEVER SHE NEEDS.

28:29.879 --> 28:33.082
HEY, LOOK, THIS DOESN'T
HAVE TO HAPPEN RIGHT NOW.

28:33.082 --> 28:36.285
OKAY, SH-SHE'LL BE ON DIALYSIS
UNTIL WE FIND A DONOR.

28:36.285 --> 28:40.950
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE SPARE
PARTS FOR YOUR SISTER ANYMORE.

28:40.950 --> 28:43.923
(inhales deeply)

28:43.923 --> 28:47.396
(voice breaking)
HERE'S WHAT I NEED.

28:47.396 --> 28:50.129
I NEED A BOYFRIEND...

28:50.129 --> 28:52.201
AND A JOB...

28:52.201 --> 28:56.235
AND A CARIBBEAN CRUISE...
(chuckles)
(laughs)

28:56.235 --> 28:58.908
AND I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN
TO RIDE A BIKE,

28:58.908 --> 29:01.040
BECAUSE I NEVER LEARNED
TO RIDE ONE WHEN I WAS LITTLE.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.171
I COULDN'T GET INJURED

29:02.171 --> 29:03.973
'CAUSE REESE MIGHT NEED
SOME BODY PART.

29:03.973 --> 29:05.845
AND I'D LOVE TO NOT BE

29:05.845 --> 29:09.048
SPARE PARTS FOR MY SISTER
ANYMORE,

29:09.048 --> 29:10.419
BUT CAN I DO THAT?

29:10.419 --> 29:12.051
CAN I SAY NO?

29:12.051 --> 29:14.884
YES, YOU CAN SAY NO.
IT'S YOUR LIFE.

29:14.884 --> 29:17.426
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
RIDE THAT BIKE.

29:17.426 --> 29:20.189
GO ON THAT CRUISE.
GET A BOYFRIEND.

29:20.189 --> 29:23.232
DANCE IN YOUR UNDERWEAR.
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

29:23.232 --> 29:24.763
YEAH, YOU CAN SAY NO.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.766
I CAN SAY NO.
YEAH, IT FEELS GOOD,
RIGHT?

29:27.766 --> 29:29.899
I CAN SAY NO!

29:29.899 --> 29:31.370
YOU CAN SAY NO!

29:31.370 --> 29:32.842
NO! NO!
NO!

29:32.842 --> 29:35.004
NO! NO!
NO! NO!

29:35.004 --> 29:38.978
(both laugh)

29:38.978 --> 29:41.550
(telephone ringing in distance)

29:41.550 --> 29:44.153
OH, SWEETIE.

29:44.153 --> 29:47.186
I'M HIS WIFE.
I WAS OUT OF TOWN.

29:47.186 --> 29:51.190
WHAT HAPPENED?
WELL, HE... CAME IN
WITH QUITE A FEW STINGS

29:51.190 --> 29:54.363
IN HIS GROIN AREA. AND--
OH, NO.

29:54.363 --> 29:56.095
HE DIDN'T.

29:56.095 --> 29:59.198
HE STUCK HIS PENIS IN THAT
HORNET'S NEST, DIDN'T HE?

29:59.198 --> 30:01.470
YOU KNEW?

30:01.470 --> 30:05.034
HOW?
I SAW A NEST ON THE EAVES
AS I LEFT.

30:05.034 --> 30:06.335
I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE
HAD IT REMOVED.

30:06.335 --> 30:09.138
SO... THIS IS SOMETHING
HE'S DONE BEFORE?

30:09.138 --> 30:12.241
HE'S SOMEONE WHO...

30:12.241 --> 30:15.484
LIKES A LITTLE PAIN
WITH HIS PLEASURE.

30:15.484 --> 30:17.917
ANY KIND OF STING,
REALLY.

30:17.917 --> 30:20.549
BEE, ANT...

30:20.549 --> 30:22.521
I'M SURE HE WAS ASHAMED.

30:22.521 --> 30:24.553
THAT'S WHY IT TOOK HIM
SO LONG TO COME IN.

30:24.553 --> 30:26.996
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT
EITHER.

30:26.996 --> 30:30.329
BUT IT'S JUST ONE THING.

30:30.329 --> 30:33.532
THERE ARE 500 THINGS
ABOUT HIM...

30:33.532 --> 30:36.135
(chuckles) THAT ARE SO MUCH
MORE INTERESTING.

30:36.135 --> 30:39.108
(under breath)
THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.214
WHEW! I'M HERE.

30:46.545 --> 30:49.448
WHAT'S SHE DOING HERE?
SHE'S DOING THE LIVER.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.180
I'M DOING THE LIVER.

30:51.180 --> 30:52.922
SHE NEEDED TWO STAPLES.
I ACTUALLY LEFT HER

30:52.922 --> 30:55.184
IN THE HANDS OF JENNA--
THAT NURSE THAT--
I DON'T CARE ABOUT ZOLA.

30:55.184 --> 30:56.926
I'M THINKING ABOUT
THE PATIENT.

30:56.926 --> 30:59.258
WHOA, DIAL IT BACK
FOR A SECOND.
DOES SHE HAVE A CONCUSSION?

30:59.258 --> 31:01.190
NO, SHE'S FINE.
ARE YOU?

31:01.190 --> 31:02.892
YOU'RE GONNA BE WORRIED
ABOUT THAT

31:02.892 --> 31:05.634
AND A HUNDRED OTHER THINGS
BESIDES MY PATIENT AND MY LIVER.

31:05.634 --> 31:07.997
SHE IS MY PATIENT,

31:07.997 --> 31:09.398
AND SHE WAS MY PATIENT
BEFORE--

31:09.398 --> 31:11.100
DID YOU FINISH READING
THE ARTICLE ON PERFORMING

31:11.100 --> 31:13.402
SIMULTANEOUS TRANSPLANTS
COMPLETELY UNDER C.P.B.?

31:17.046 --> 31:18.507
DR. BAILEY KNOWS
THE PROCEDURE.

31:18.507 --> 31:21.080
DR. BAILEY IS SCRUBBING IN
ON MY PATIENT.

31:22.311 --> 31:24.213
(door opens)

31:24.213 --> 31:27.116
SORRY.

31:27.116 --> 31:29.959
(door opens)

31:33.462 --> 31:35.464
(horns honking in distance)

31:35.464 --> 31:37.997
PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE
CHECKED BACK EARLIER.

31:37.997 --> 31:41.530
YOUR... WHITE BLOOD CELL COUNT
IS ELEVATED.

31:41.530 --> 31:43.232
I'D LIKE TO START YOU
ON ANTIBIOTICS.

31:43.232 --> 31:45.234
WHY DO I NEED ANTIBIOTICS?

31:45.234 --> 31:47.436
BECAUSE THERE'S
A LEFT SHIFT?

31:47.436 --> 31:49.478
YOU NEED TO EXAMINE ME

31:49.478 --> 31:52.611
TO FIND OUT
WHAT'S CAUSING THE ELEVATION.

31:56.485 --> 31:58.087
MURPHY...

31:58.087 --> 31:59.989
I DON'T WANT TO BE CODDLED
OR PUSSY-FOOTED AROUND.

31:59.989 --> 32:01.590
NO OFFENSE.
IT MAKES YOU A BAD DOCTOR

32:01.590 --> 32:04.923
AND ME A SICKER PATIENT.
SO BUCK UP,

32:04.923 --> 32:08.597
LIFT MY GOWN AND GIVE ME
A PROPER HANDS-ON EXAM.

32:08.597 --> 32:10.659
YES, SIR.

32:14.233 --> 32:16.935
(sighs)

32:16.935 --> 32:19.338
(grunts)

32:19.338 --> 32:20.639
IT... FEELS DISTENDED.

32:20.639 --> 32:22.972
OKAY, WHAT DOES THAT
TELL YOU?

32:22.972 --> 32:25.314
THERE COULD BE
FLUID BUILDUP.
OKAY.

32:25.314 --> 32:26.545
YOU'RE CHECKING THE DRAIN?

32:26.545 --> 32:28.277
THERE'S NO OUTPUT.

32:28.277 --> 32:30.549
(strained voice)
OKAY, WHAT ELSE?

32:30.549 --> 32:34.323
YOU HAVE EPIGASTRIC TENDERNESS,
INCREASED W.B.C.,

32:34.323 --> 32:35.554
AND LITTLE TO NO DRAIN
OUTPUT,

32:35.554 --> 32:38.357
WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE A...

32:38.357 --> 32:40.629
SYMPTOMATIC PANCREATIC LEAK.
OKAY.

32:40.629 --> 32:42.491
WHICH ALSO MEANS
I'M IN A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN.

32:42.491 --> 32:44.533
NOW YOU NEED TO TRY
AND UNCLOG THE DRAIN

32:44.533 --> 32:46.635
WITH A FOGARTY CATHETER
SO THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN!

32:46.635 --> 32:48.697
GOD.

32:51.640 --> 32:54.373
THERE'S THE BOSSY RICHARD
I KNOW AND LOVE.

32:54.373 --> 32:58.447
(sighs) THEY'RE GONNA LEARN
HOW TO LOOK ME IN THE EYE

32:58.447 --> 33:00.049
AND EXPLAIN TO ME
WHAT THEY'RE DOING

33:00.049 --> 33:01.310
SO I UNDERSTAND.

33:01.310 --> 33:04.153
WHEN I ASK A QUESTION,
THEY'RE GOING TO ANSWER IT.

33:04.153 --> 33:05.514
THEY'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT
WHY MY PANCREAS

33:05.514 --> 33:06.585
STILL REQUIRES A DRAIN.

33:06.585 --> 33:10.189
SO I... TAKE IT

33:10.189 --> 33:12.161
YOU'RE NOT COMING HOME
WITH ME.

33:14.093 --> 33:15.664
THESE FOOLS NEED ME,
CATHERINE.

33:15.664 --> 33:17.626
WELL, WHAT IF
I NEED YOU, TOO?

33:17.626 --> 33:20.569
COME HERE.

33:20.569 --> 33:22.701
(sighs)

33:27.506 --> 33:29.608
YOU GOT ME.

33:29.608 --> 33:32.041
I'M RIGHT HERE.

33:32.041 --> 33:34.043
HEY, GOING BACK
TO THE TRIBE?

33:34.043 --> 33:35.684
AFTER I GRAB SOFIA.
HOW ABOUT YOU?

33:35.684 --> 33:36.685
SEEING YOUR NOT-GIRLFRIEND?

33:36.685 --> 33:38.487
(chuckles)
THAT WAS THE PLAN,

33:38.487 --> 33:41.019
BUT I'M GOING TO TALK
TO THE HANG GLIDER'S SISTER.

33:41.019 --> 33:44.193
SHE DECIDED TO DONATE
A KIDNEY AFTER ALL.

33:47.656 --> 33:50.559
(clicking button)

33:50.559 --> 33:52.461
(elevator bell dings)

33:52.461 --> 33:55.734
(indistinct conversations)

33:55.734 --> 33:58.107
(button clicks)

34:02.811 --> 34:04.073
(bell dings)

34:04.073 --> 34:06.645
(sighs)

34:10.319 --> 34:13.552
(bell dings)

34:13.552 --> 34:16.054
(bell dings)
TAKE IT EASY, PAL.

34:18.587 --> 34:20.559
(indistinct conversations)

34:20.559 --> 34:21.730
