00:34.667 --> 00:36.567
Shelby?

00:36.636 --> 00:38.331
Shelby, wake up.

00:38.405 --> 00:40.771
Where am I?
Tree Trunks, what's going on?

00:40.840 --> 00:43.673
You've been snoozing
on my dome.

00:43.743 --> 00:47.008
I just woke up in this room
with these fellas.

00:47.080 --> 00:51.210
Nectar, Ice Cream, and one of
the Lemoncarbs.

00:51.284 --> 00:52.410
Awake!

00:52.485 --> 00:53.474
Avast!

00:53.553 --> 00:57.853
Hold tight your buns,
if buns you do hold dear,

00:57.924 --> 01:01.291
for time has come
to wake and run

01:01.361 --> 01:04.022
and not give way to fear!

01:04.096 --> 01:07.032
What are those awful words?!

01:07.100 --> 01:10.331
I am reading the wall.
They are wall words.

01:10.403 --> 01:15.033
"Beyond this room are a thousand rooms.

01:15.108 --> 01:17.303
Outside of them, still more."

01:17.377 --> 01:19.607
"Behind each door
on every floor...

01:19.679 --> 01:22.512
Danger! Danger!
Evermore."

01:22.582 --> 01:25.142
"Stranger, hark!
The traps galore

01:25.218 --> 01:28.619
may kill you
whilst you do explore

01:28.688 --> 01:30.121
to free yourself..."

01:30.190 --> 01:31.680
Huh?

01:31.758 --> 01:33.453
Oh! Now, where were we...

01:33.526 --> 01:37.622
"To free yourself from this tomb
and nevermore re-enter,

01:37.697 --> 01:42.134
find the room amidst the rooms
that lies exactly center?"

01:42.202 --> 01:43.760
It's a map!

01:43.837 --> 01:45.702
I no longer need this map.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.172
I have infallible recall.

01:53.446 --> 01:56.506
Oh! Th-Th-The room is trying
to hug us!

01:57.684 --> 01:59.151
Oh no!

01:59.219 --> 02:00.811
Oh, dag!

02:00.887 --> 02:02.718
Check out my mods, bro!

02:02.789 --> 02:04.916
Aaaaah!
Huh?

02:06.893 --> 02:10.124
Enough of this!

02:10.196 --> 02:12.926
Ohh!

02:12.999 --> 02:14.091
Huh?

02:14.167 --> 02:16.135
This room doesn't have
any doors.

02:16.202 --> 02:17.999
We're... we're trapped!

02:18.071 --> 02:20.562
This is wrong.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.870
The map lied to me!

02:22.942 --> 02:25.604
It doesn't want me to
find the exit!

02:25.678 --> 02:28.772
Ice King,
how do you taste?!

02:28.848 --> 02:30.406
Uh, nice, I guess.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.178
Mild or spicy!?

02:32.252 --> 02:34.516
Oh, uh...

02:37.957 --> 02:39.754
Kind of lonely.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.657
Make yourself into food now!

02:41.728 --> 02:44.219
<i>You're</i> gonna eat <i>me?</i>
Oh, yeah, right!

02:44.297 --> 02:45.855
Shlop your mouths up.

02:45.932 --> 02:48.867
I have found an oven
and baking supplies!

02:48.935 --> 02:52.234
I can make an apple pie
for all of us!

02:52.305 --> 02:54.239
Make them fast, "serval!"

02:54.307 --> 02:57.936
If you want a taste of my
juicy apple pie,

02:58.011 --> 02:59.103
you better be nice.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.010
You got that?

03:01.080 --> 03:04.447
I am sorry.
Make pies, slave.

03:04.517 --> 03:06.314
Okay, that's better.

03:06.386 --> 03:09.685
Now, let's see
about this pie business.

03:09.756 --> 03:12.452
All right, gentlemen,
have a look

03:12.525 --> 03:15.517
at my luscious, gooey
apple pie.

03:15.595 --> 03:17.586
Ooh!

03:22.735 --> 03:24.327
Aah!

03:24.404 --> 03:27.931
No!

03:28.007 --> 03:30.271
Mmm. Acceptable.

03:30.343 --> 03:31.708
Uh, Lemongrab.

03:31.778 --> 03:33.769
- What?
- Never mind.

03:34.981 --> 03:38.610
Come on, guys, that mouse
showed us the room door.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.211
Say, you know what's weird?

03:42.288 --> 03:43.755
What, papi?

03:43.823 --> 03:45.791
Uh, well, isn't it weird

03:45.858 --> 03:47.587
how Tree Trunks' ability
to make pies

03:47.660 --> 03:50.925
is specifically what helped us
escape from that room?

03:50.997 --> 03:52.988
I make pies, too, papi.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.830
Right, yeah, like
battery pies or something?

03:57.704 --> 03:58.898
No, real pies.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.371
Don't you remember?

04:00.440 --> 04:01.429
I am your su...

04:01.507 --> 04:03.236
Hey look!
Another room!

04:06.512 --> 04:08.343
Good grief,
it's humid in here.

04:08.414 --> 04:11.178
That door will lead us closer
to the exit!

04:11.251 --> 04:13.014
Hold up! Hold up!

04:13.086 --> 04:16.886
Look!

04:16.956 --> 04:19.015
There has to be a way
to get across

04:19.091 --> 04:21.458
without that thing
chompin' our hoo-hoos!

04:21.527 --> 04:23.654
Can't you fly us across,
papi?

04:23.730 --> 04:25.493
Uh, yeah, I can
sure try...

04:26.766 --> 04:29.291
Galdang, this heat is
negating my powers!

04:29.369 --> 04:32.600
Can't do nothing with this steam
comin' off the water!

04:32.672 --> 04:33.730
Aah!

04:33.806 --> 04:35.967
Dear glob! Zap!

04:36.042 --> 04:37.907
Ach! Look at this! Pbht!

04:37.977 --> 04:39.706
Well, that's it.
Show's over!

04:39.779 --> 04:41.041
I'll just die here,

04:41.114 --> 04:44.550
and y'all can eat my body
if you want to survive.

04:45.918 --> 04:49.115
Golly! How're we ever gonna
worm our way out

04:49.188 --> 04:52.419
of this fishy situation?

04:52.492 --> 04:54.551
I think I have an idea.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.094
That's a girl, Tree Trunks.

04:56.162 --> 04:58.494
You can do it!

04:58.564 --> 05:01.032
Ah, this is all gonna work out
just fine.

05:01.100 --> 05:06.197
Ooh! That's warm on my
undercarriage.

05:08.341 --> 05:09.933
Help me, guys!

05:10.009 --> 05:11.943
Yes, papi!

05:12.011 --> 05:13.171
Lemongrab, come on!

05:19.886 --> 05:23.344
Bleh! Wow!
That was heavy, man!

05:24.824 --> 05:28.351
Haha!
Yeah, I've been reborn!

05:28.428 --> 05:30.658
Look!

05:30.730 --> 05:32.391
Let's go then!

05:36.269 --> 05:37.258
Ohh!

05:37.337 --> 05:39.032
Papi, no!

05:39.105 --> 05:40.367
Ouchies!

05:40.440 --> 05:41.566
Aah!

05:41.641 --> 05:43.131
Look out, Shelby!

05:43.209 --> 05:45.643
Whoa! Whoa!

05:45.712 --> 05:46.576
Aah!

05:46.646 --> 05:50.047
Wah! My juice!
My vital juices!

05:50.116 --> 05:52.311
Mommy!!

05:56.389 --> 05:58.118
The hidden door!

06:00.626 --> 06:03.754
My vital essence depleted.

06:03.830 --> 06:06.765
Must... replenish...

06:06.833 --> 06:10.098
Oh, step back, y'all.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.262
Ugh.

06:12.338 --> 06:13.999
Ew.

06:16.175 --> 06:19.338
Oh, that will do,
Slave Trunks.

06:19.412 --> 06:21.403
To the spiraling ledge!

06:21.481 --> 06:23.642
We almost there,
Lemongrab?

06:23.716 --> 06:24.740
Yes!

06:24.817 --> 06:25.806
Faster T.T.!

06:25.885 --> 06:29.286
Don't criticize my running,
Shelby.

06:31.424 --> 06:33.415
Aaah!

06:41.534 --> 06:43.900
This door leads
to the center exit.

06:43.970 --> 06:47.337
The door is secured with an
esoteric encryption system.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.739
Well, that's okay
'cause you can

06:49.809 --> 06:52.778
"hack the main frame" or
whatever, right, BMO?

06:52.845 --> 06:55.746
I'm not BMO.
I'm your son... NEPTR.

06:55.815 --> 06:57.840
I-I throw pies.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.784
Ahs!
I grabbed the wrong robot!

07:00.853 --> 07:02.286
Dirt! Nuts! Face!

07:02.355 --> 07:04.846
Uh, what is going on here,
Ice King?

07:04.924 --> 07:07.950
Yes. I am getting a weird feeling
in my stomach,

07:08.027 --> 07:11.155
and I think it's
'cause of you, Mr. Wizard.

07:11.230 --> 07:14.358
You better fess up
to whatever you're doing.

07:14.434 --> 07:18.837
I got no time for nobody
dancin' around

07:18.905 --> 07:22.898
and actin' a fool
at my expense.

07:22.975 --> 07:27.844
I'm Tree Trunks, and people
know I'm kind and honest.

07:27.914 --> 07:29.814
That's why people like me.

07:29.882 --> 07:32.282
Huh? What?
What was she saying?

07:32.351 --> 07:36.811
So stop sellin' fib bibs
and give it straight.

07:36.889 --> 07:38.481
Oh! All right!

07:38.558 --> 07:40.355
I knocked y'all out
and brought you here!

07:40.426 --> 07:42.986
I'm sorry,
but I had to do it!

07:43.062 --> 07:45.155
Each of you possessed
the exact qualities

07:45.231 --> 07:48.257
to pass the various
tests of this dungeon.

07:48.334 --> 07:50.825
Tree Trunks with your baking
skills...

07:50.903 --> 07:53.633
Lemongrab with your lemony,
juicy...

07:53.706 --> 07:56.174
- Essence.
- Yeah.

07:56.242 --> 07:58.938
Shelby, who should have been
the bait for the fish.

07:59.011 --> 08:00.842
Yeah, but no thanks.

08:00.913 --> 08:02.881
And BMO, who should
have been here

08:02.949 --> 08:04.814
instead of this weird
piece of junk

08:04.884 --> 08:06.681
that I don't remember
nothin' about.

08:06.752 --> 08:09.346
Aah! I failed!

08:09.422 --> 08:14.689
Father, look at me!

08:15.995 --> 08:19.055
Are you happy with me now,
papi?

08:19.131 --> 08:22.931
Yes! Yes!
Oh, my son!

08:23.002 --> 08:25.596
The grand prize of me loins!

08:28.307 --> 08:31.743
Now you see why I needed
to bring you here!

08:31.811 --> 08:36.407
Behold the ancient sleeping magi
of life giving.

08:36.482 --> 08:38.109
What's it do?

08:38.183 --> 08:42.245
Whatever goes in the magi's
flames comes to life!

08:42.321 --> 08:43.788
Anything at all!

08:43.856 --> 08:45.915
Like an ashtray?

08:45.992 --> 08:48.222
Yes!
Isn't it amazing?

08:48.294 --> 08:49.955
Uh, you should have told us.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.293
I would have freaking
brought something.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.832
Well, don't be sad,

08:53.900 --> 08:57.893
because I brought the ultimate
thing... this!

08:57.970 --> 08:59.130
Your journal?

08:59.205 --> 09:01.901
Except it's not my
journal!

09:01.974 --> 09:06.240
It's my "Fionna and Cake"
fan fiction!

09:06.312 --> 09:09.804
All my brilliant fantasies
will now be real!

09:09.882 --> 09:12.350
Fionna, Cake, Marshall Lee...

09:12.418 --> 09:16.252
They'll all be living, breathing
beings just like me!

09:16.322 --> 09:18.290
You serve no function.

09:18.357 --> 09:20.086
You must be destroyed!

09:20.159 --> 09:22.320
No!

09:22.395 --> 09:24.226
Aaaaaah!

09:28.234 --> 09:30.930
Yes! Yes!

09:31.003 --> 09:32.061
Whoo!

09:32.138 --> 09:33.696
Ha-ha-ha!

09:33.773 --> 09:34.762
Yeah!

09:34.840 --> 09:37.365
Nooo! No!

09:37.443 --> 09:40.640
Another cruel joke
on my life!

09:41.647 --> 09:44.514
Oh, good, you're awake,
you bum!

09:44.584 --> 09:46.313
Look what you did!

09:46.385 --> 09:48.148
Get out of my face!

09:48.220 --> 09:50.313
Yeah, yeah, get lost!

09:50.389 --> 09:52.789
This is the spot?
Right here?

09:52.858 --> 09:54.189
What was that?

09:54.260 --> 09:57.286
Come on, Ice Cream,
we're leaving.

09:58.230 --> 09:59.925
Okay.

10:01.167 --> 10:04.330
I'm tellin you, dude,
my pie-dar is goin nay-nays.

10:06.372 --> 10:07.771
Ho!

10:07.840 --> 10:09.501
- What the?
- Write in me!

10:09.575 --> 10:10.803
This is very strange!

10:10.876 --> 10:12.400
T.T., where's the pie at?

10:12.478 --> 10:15.470
Uh, Mr. Lemoncarb ate it.

10:15.548 --> 10:18.244
Bye-don't-follow-me.

10:18.317 --> 10:20.182
Hey, Jake, can I hitch a ride
back home?

10:20.252 --> 10:22.186
Yeah, but what the heck
is going on here?

10:22.254 --> 10:24.347
Ice King was doing some
desperate business.

10:24.423 --> 10:25.412
It didn't work out.

10:25.491 --> 10:26.958
I think he's pretty
bummed out about it.

10:27.026 --> 10:28.288
Don't be sad, papi.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.192
Your characters
can always be real

10:30.262 --> 10:32.093
in the garden of your mind.

10:32.164 --> 10:33.324
They can?

10:33.399 --> 10:37.233
Remember when you showed me
your imagination zone?

10:37.303 --> 10:41.364
Yes, yes, if I can
concentrate...

10:41.440 --> 10:43.908
It worked!

10:43.976 --> 10:46.035
I missed you, Ice King!

10:46.112 --> 10:50.173
Oh, Fionna, can dreams be
as real as waking life?

10:50.249 --> 10:53.013
Of course they can!
Dreams are real!

10:53.085 --> 10:54.552
Then I will wait for you

10:54.620 --> 10:57.350
from across the threshold
of consciousness!

10:57.423 --> 11:00.153
Our worlds will surely meet,
Ice King!

11:00.226 --> 11:02.091
I, too, feel this.

11:02.161 --> 11:05.062
And it feels so strong.
It must be true!

11:05.131 --> 11:06.359
And across the gulf...

11:06.432 --> 11:08.627
Who in this world is
sadder than the Ice King?

11:08.701 --> 11:10.328
Me... watching this.

11:10.403 --> 11:12.667
...you will hear me,
and I will hear you.
