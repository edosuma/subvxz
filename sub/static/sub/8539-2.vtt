TO SAY "SORRY" TO MELANIE?

15:39.982 --> 15:42.419
I DIDN'T KILL HER.I DIDN'T SAY THAT YOU DID.

15:42.506 --> 15:45.770

TO SAY "SORRY" TO HER.

15:45.857 --> 15:49.339

15:55.041 --> 15:56.956
THERE'S NO LAW AGAINST WAITING

SHE DIDN'T LEAVE.

16:11.361 --> 16:14.103

AND LAUGHING,

16:14.190 --> 16:16.192
SO I FIGURED
I WAS DOING PRETTY GOOD.

16:16.279 --> 16:18.716

16:21.719 --> 16:24.331
ONLY I KNOW SHE HAS THIS
WHOLE VIRGIN THING HAPPENING.

16:24.418 --> 16:27.334

I JUST HAVE TO BE MORE...

16:27.421 --> 16:29.989
GOAL-ORIENTED.

16:30.076 --> 16:32.208
SHE WAS PRETTY UPSET,

16:32.295 --> 16:35.951
SO I APOLOGIZED FOR ANY
MISUNDERSTANDING, AND I LEFT.BITCH!

16:36.038 --> 16:38.736

DROVE OFF, AND THAT WAS IT.

16:38.823 --> 16:42.131

SHE WOULD STILL BE MAD AT ME

16:42.218 --> 16:43.654
AND, LIKE, COMPLAIN.

16:43.741 --> 16:45.787
WHEN I GOT IN TO WORK
THIS MORNING,

16:45.874 --> 16:48.311
BEFORE I KNEW THAT SHE WAS
MISSING, I WROTE "SORRY,"

16:48.398 --> 16:50.400
AND I PUT IT IN HER LOCKER.

16:52.098 --> 16:54.230
HOW LONG WERE YOU

16:54.317 --> 16:57.842
TRY AND BE PRECISE.FIVE MINUTES. SIX.

17:00.802 --> 17:03.196
RANDALL TRIED TO KISS MELANIE
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT

17:03.283 --> 17:05.676
IT WAS ON HIS ACCOUNT
THAT SHE DIDN'T LEAVE.

17:05.763 --> 17:09.289
BUT IN FACT, SHE DIDN'T LEAVE
BECAUSE OF RANDALL.SHE WAS MEETING SOMEBODY ELSE.

17:09.376 --> 17:10.855
ARE WE GONNA SEE
RAQUEL AGAIN?

in duct tape, unharmed.

saw her abductors. No suspects.

18:04.387 --> 18:06.824
THAT IT WAS THE SAME GUY
DID BOTH CRIMES.

18:06.911 --> 18:09.392
HE KIDNAPS A REDHEADED GIRL,
TIES HER UP, TAKES HER

18:09.479 --> 18:12.830
TO A MOTEL ROOM, HAS HER
AT HIS MERCY BUT DOES NOTHING.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.745

ANOTHER REDHEADED GIRL,

18:14.832 --> 18:16.530
BUT HIS PLANNING
IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH,

18:16.617 --> 18:19.315
AND HE KILLS HER IN A PANIC
TO KEEP HER QUIET.

18:19.402 --> 18:21.752
WHAT DOES THAT SAY?HE'S AN IDIOT?

18:21.839 --> 18:23.624

18:23.711 --> 18:25.234
HE'S HUNGRY
FOR TERRIBLE THINGS,

18:25.321 --> 18:27.584
BUT HIS CONSCIENCE
TELLS HIM NOT TO.

18:27.671 --> 18:30.413
