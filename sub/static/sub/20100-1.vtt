<i>Mother, prepare the room,
offer welcome to the groom. (UKR)</i>

01:56.126 --> 02:01.376
<i>The fiancés of yesterday
turn to newlyweds today. (U KR)</i>

02:03.584 --> 02:07.042
If the door keeps shut,
we'll burn down the hut! (UKR)

02:07.501 --> 02:11.251
<i>What brings you to this place?</i>

02:13.042 --> 02:16.667
<i>What brings you to this place?</i>

02:17.542 --> 02:20.251
<i>We don't want to see your face.</i>

02:21.126 --> 02:23.584
<i>Don't you have any food? (UKR)</i>

02:23.876 --> 02:26.667
<i>This doesn't look too good. (UKR)</i>

02:26.876 --> 02:29.667
<i>Welcome the beau of the bride,</i>

02:29.959 --> 02:32.501
<i>And let us all inside.</i>

02:33.292 --> 02:36.334
<i>Oh Hela, you pretty lass...</i>

02:37.834 --> 02:41.501
<i>Oh Hela, you pretty lass...</i>

02:42.417 --> 02:46.334
<i>Open up and let us pass.</i>

02:47.459 --> 02:53.042
<i>Put your maiden wreath
on a tray,</i>

02:54.459 --> 02:58.417
<i>Put your maiden wreath
on a tray,</i>

03:00.042 --> 03:04.084
<i>The groom is ready to pay.</i>

03:09.084 --> 03:13.001
<i>Bow your head down, oh dear Hela.</i>

03:16.126 --> 03:20.126
<i>Bow your head down, oh dear Hela.</i>

03:21.542 --> 03:26.834
<i>Bow your head down, oh dear maiden.</i>

03:30.001 --> 03:35.126
<i>Ask pardon of your father and mother,</i>

03:38.042 --> 03:41.959
<i>Ask pardon of your father and mother,</i>

03:44.876 --> 03:50.042
<i>You'll be happy like no other.</i>

03:53.834 --> 03:58.209
Father... mother...
I ask for your blessing. (UKR)

03:59.334 --> 04:02.459
"Beware of false prophets,

04:03.292 --> 04:08.917
who come to you in sheep's clothing,
but inwardly are ravening wolves."

04:09.626 --> 04:12.917
Instead of preaching the Kingdom of God,

04:13.126 --> 04:15.876
they announce the Ukrainian kingdom.

04:16.041 --> 04:19.666
And the effect? Escalation
of acts of sabotage

04:20.250 --> 04:23.751
and even acts of murder
on the Polish citizens.

04:25.126 --> 04:28.001
There is no more brotherly love between

04:28.584 --> 04:31.084
the Poles and the Orthodox people.

04:31.251 --> 04:35.834
- He's a Pole now? (UKR)
- No! He is an Orthodox! (UKR)

04:36.126 --> 04:40.876
I appeal to the Orthodox believers
who are so numerously gathered here:

04:42.459 --> 04:45.209
we are all children of one God.

04:45.917 --> 04:48.834
And God willing, today's wedding

04:49.042 --> 04:52.042
of Hela Glowacka and Vasil Huk

04:52.542 --> 04:55.959
shall become the spark

04:56.626 --> 05:00.126
that lights up the dying flame
of the bond of yesteryear.

05:06.126 --> 05:10.917
The potatoes are at the parsonage,
we'll bring the flour after the harvest.

05:11.417 --> 05:14.084
And we're expecting you at the feast.

05:20.542 --> 05:22.376
You have to win. (UKR)

05:26.251 --> 05:27.251
Ready? (UKR)

05:47.751 --> 05:49.001
Come on! (UKR)

06:18.917 --> 06:21.417
Petro! What a ride! (UKR)

06:33.501 --> 06:36.334
I can't. State monopoly. (UKR)

06:36.751 --> 06:39.251
Suddenly you find money disgusting? (UKR)

06:39.917 --> 06:43.084
I have no license. The Poles have it. (UKR)

06:43.542 --> 06:46.751
The Poles sniff around and arrest us. (UKR)

06:46.917 --> 06:49.084
They confiscate everything: (UKR)

06:49.459 --> 06:52.209
pamphlets, guns... (UKR)

06:52.917 --> 06:55.792
And what happened to
Ukrainian schools? (UKR)

06:56.376 --> 06:59.251
They closed down all of them. (UKR)

07:00.209 --> 07:05.209
All right. I will sell you the vodka.
But at 2.50 a liter. (UKR)

07:05.667 --> 07:06.667
What?! (UKR)

07:07.001 --> 07:10.876
You are marrying a Polish girl
and can't afford good booze? (UKR)

07:11.126 --> 07:14.626
- You'd ask less if I were Polish. (UKR)
- I'd ask more. (UKR)

07:14.834 --> 07:17.792
I'll give you a discount:
five cents per bottle. (UKR)

07:17.959 --> 07:19.334
- Ten. (UKR)
- Deal. (UKR)

07:20.584 --> 07:21.876
Vasyl! (UKR)

07:22.376 --> 07:24.417
Meet Bohdan. (UKR)

07:24.834 --> 07:27.167
He came here from Lviv, (UKR)

07:27.751 --> 07:29.417
but he is our man. (UKR)

07:29.584 --> 07:32.792
- Glory to Jesus Christ. (UKR)
- Forever and ever. (UKR)

07:32.959 --> 07:35.251
He planned to go to university, (UKR)

07:35.584 --> 07:37.501
but he's against the Polish law, (UKR)

07:37.667 --> 07:42.001
so they didn't let him.
Let's invite him to the wedding. (UKR)

07:46.292 --> 07:48.459
- Are you happy?
- Very.

07:53.917 --> 07:54.917
And you?

07:55.334 --> 07:56.584
Me?

07:57.292 --> 07:59.501
Have you two already kissed?

08:02.501 --> 08:04.042
They're coming!

08:10.334 --> 08:11.376
Come on!

08:11.542 --> 08:12.584
We'll win!

08:34.458 --> 08:36.458
Kwiatkowski, get up!

08:41.251 --> 08:42.333
Look here!

09:08.959 --> 09:12.334
Communism is better.
Everyone gets the same. (UKR)

09:12.667 --> 09:14.459
Evenhandedly. (UKR)

09:14.959 --> 09:18.292
They force us to speak Polish
and practice Catholicism. (UKR)

09:20.209 --> 09:24.959
They demolish our churches
and tell us to go to their <i>mass.</i> (UKR)

09:25.209 --> 09:28.084
They want to make Poles out of us. (UKR)

09:42.251 --> 09:45.376
The Pole's a rich lad,
the Ukrainian's a cad.

09:46.792 --> 09:49.209
You know what their gendarmes do? (UKR)

09:50.167 --> 09:53.167
They hang Ukrainian girls head-down. (UKR)

09:53.667 --> 09:57.001
- Whatever for? (UKR)
- To make their skirts fall. (UKR)

09:57.626 --> 10:02.459
The skirts are colorful,
so they call them "tulips". (UKR)

10:26.584 --> 10:28.751
<i>Oh welcome, welcome,</i>

10:28.917 --> 10:32.584
<i>wedding korovai.</i>

10:34.584 --> 10:36.876
<i>Oh, welcome, welcome,</i>

10:37.209 --> 10:40.959
<i>delicious korovai.</i>

10:47.626 --> 10:50.667
<i>Rich Maciej, do as you're told</i>

10:50.876 --> 10:53.876
<i>Pay for the cake in gold.</i>

10:54.126 --> 10:57.501
<i>If you care for this lass,</i>

10:57.959 --> 11:00.584
<i>Leave some of it to us.</i>

11:03.626 --> 11:06.792
Money does not bring happiness.

11:06.959 --> 11:08.876
But it's good to have it.

11:10.459 --> 11:12.959
<i>Rich man, do as you're told:</i>

11:13.126 --> 11:16.251
<i>Pay for the korovai in gold.</i>

11:18.501 --> 11:20.959
- A wolf bit him!
- A dog.

11:21.459 --> 11:23.042
Get me a cloth! (UKR)

11:23.667 --> 11:27.001
Is that a way to greet your priest?
No vodka?

11:27.209 --> 11:31.042
Once they've tasted human blood,
they won't stop attacking.

11:32.376 --> 11:34.292
Pass me the vodka! (UKR)

11:37.084 --> 11:38.959
And for the other foot?

11:45.751 --> 11:50.501
<i>My periwinkle maiden wreath,</i>

11:52.334 --> 11:55.584
<i>I adorned you with heath.</i>

12:01.251 --> 12:04.834
<i>I shall put you in my dowry chest</i>

12:10.376 --> 12:13.501
<i>I shall put you in my dowry chest.</i>

12:17.126 --> 12:20.542
<i>Where from now on you shall rest.</i>

13:45.876 --> 13:50.751
<i>Don't weep,</i>
oh willow tree by the river. (UKR)

13:56.626 --> 13:59.834
<i>Don't weep,</i>
oh willow tree by the river. (UKR)

14:06.959 --> 14:12.376
<i>Don't shed tears over me,
dear mother...</i> (UKR)

14:54.417 --> 14:57.042
Let's drink Hitler's health. (UKR)

14:58.917 --> 15:02.209
He will help us create
sovereign Ukraine. (UKR)

15:02.876 --> 15:04.459
You'll see. (UKR)

16:18.751 --> 16:21.542
She's too young for you, Maciej.

16:22.251 --> 16:25.917
- People will scorn.
- No more than they do today.

16:26.209 --> 16:29.251
That her sister married a <i>khokhol.</i>

16:29.751 --> 16:33.126
- You hold a grudge against him?
- Not at all.

16:33.626 --> 16:36.459
Better marry a Ukrainian than a Jew.

16:49.167 --> 16:50.459
All right.

16:51.834 --> 16:54.626
I know I am older than her.

16:56.209 --> 17:00.959
But I'll sign over the land.
And love will come with time.

17:47.501 --> 17:51.417
Your wife passed away
less than a year ago.

17:51.584 --> 17:55.542
I need a new one to help me
with the kids and the farm.

17:56.417 --> 17:57.959
Do we have a deal?

18:07.251 --> 18:08.667
Fifteen acres.

18:14.376 --> 18:15.417
Ten.

18:18.167 --> 18:19.751
But the best ones.

18:24.542 --> 18:26.626
Two pigs and a cow.

18:39.417 --> 18:40.459
A horse.

18:48.792 --> 18:53.792
And we must hurry with the wedding.
It's nearly harvest time

18:54.376 --> 18:56.917
and they say war is imminent.

18:59.959 --> 19:01.667
Swear to me... (UKR)

19:02.542 --> 19:05.626
that you'll never love another. (UKR)

19:09.751 --> 19:11.626
I swear. (UKR)

19:15.167 --> 19:17.001
I swear to God. (UKR)

19:36.542 --> 19:40.084
Mom... I have to tell you something.

19:40.459 --> 19:43.376
We have something to tell you, too.

19:51.542 --> 19:53.959
You will marry Maciej.

20:22.917 --> 20:27.584
They say the Poles closed down
the Orthodox churches... (UKR)

20:28.126 --> 20:30.501
and obviated the cult. (UKR)

20:33.001 --> 20:36.084
And I was told they were not in use.

20:36.626 --> 20:40.001
Not in use? So many of them? (UKR)

20:40.459 --> 20:42.626
- What do you mean? (UKR)
- Hey!

20:55.501 --> 20:57.376
We need to talk, Father.

21:37.376 --> 21:41.167
<i>The night was mournful</i> (UKR)

21:42.501 --> 21:45.918
<i>and the morning was grey.</i> (UKR)

21:58.417 --> 22:03.542
<i>For my darling has gone away.</i> (UKR)

22:24.292 --> 22:26.834
Go and say goodbye.
Don't make a scene.

22:27.001 --> 22:29.542
- Kill me.
- It's decided.

22:29.751 --> 22:32.251
- I will never love him...
- Come on.

22:33.792 --> 22:35.084
Let's go.

22:38.667 --> 22:43.917
<i>Wander away, Hela,
wander away.</i>

22:49.417 --> 22:51.917
Why are you crying, silly?

22:52.376 --> 22:54.334
Don't be a baby.

22:55.667 --> 22:59.542
We'll come and visit in fall.
My little Zofia.

22:59.917 --> 23:03.751
<i>Leave the keys on the table.</i>

23:07.417 --> 23:12.126
<i>You'll have a new house and stable.</i>

23:15.959 --> 23:19.626
<i>You will have another home</i>

23:21.334 --> 23:26.209
<i>Where you will be on your own.</i>

23:45.251 --> 23:46.251
Petro! (UKR)

24:35.834 --> 24:37.751
Budki Osowskie...

24:38.251 --> 24:40.042
Osy...

24:41.251 --> 24:43.251
And then Kustycze.

24:43.376 --> 24:46.084
Is your farm a big one?

24:46.917 --> 24:50.459
No, it isn't. I am a teacher's son.

24:51.042 --> 24:53.876
The Soviets attacked
from the other side. (UKR)

24:54.042 --> 24:55.834
Poland is no more. (UKR)

24:57.501 --> 25:01.667
If you you want to die,
do it for Ukraine. (UKR)

25:30.834 --> 25:33.001
Some more Ukrainians escaped.

25:41.417 --> 25:45.792
Bury the dead, disperse
and return home safely.

25:47.251 --> 25:49.501
This is my last order.

26:13.292 --> 26:15.376
Well? What do you say?

26:16.751 --> 26:19.834
She's so young.
Much younger than you, Corporal.

26:20.084 --> 26:24.751
And what would I do with an old one?
I was drafted right after the wedding.

26:24.959 --> 26:28.501
Right after?
So you didn't get a chance to dip it.

26:28.834 --> 26:30.876
Hey... You snot.

26:32.376 --> 26:34.167
I dipped it, all right.

26:35.501 --> 26:38.042
And I swear I'll get back to her.

26:39.376 --> 26:43.251
To them. I have children
from my first marriage.

26:43.959 --> 26:46.209
- Godspeed.
- Godspeed.

27:24.209 --> 27:26.417
It's good, isn't it?

27:40.751 --> 27:43.417
- Take that off!
- Polish lords! (UKR)

27:44.501 --> 27:46.376
Give me that uniform! (UKR)

27:46.959 --> 27:49.209
- Well?
- The uniform!

27:51.459 --> 27:53.334
- No!
- Take it off!

27:53.584 --> 27:54.876
No... No!!!

29:10.167 --> 29:11.459
Oles!

29:31.667 --> 29:33.459
Oles, you little shit! (UKR)

29:42.459 --> 29:44.084
Franek, the cows.

29:44.959 --> 29:47.042
One, two, thee, Oles caught a flea!

29:47.542 --> 29:52.251
Hawryluk, when you're done,
cut the grass and load the chaff-cutter.

29:52.417 --> 29:53.626
All right. (UKR)

30:04.209 --> 30:06.167
Franek, the cows!

30:07.251 --> 30:10.376
Moshe? Be afraid.

30:24.959 --> 30:27.501
You're hiding here again?

30:30.459 --> 30:32.042
What, bitch? (RUS)

30:49.459 --> 30:50.917
Moshe! Moshe!

30:52.209 --> 30:53.542
There's vodka! (RUS)

30:58.917 --> 31:01.917
Have you got bacon? (RUS)

31:03.501 --> 31:05.792
I have been waiting for you... (RUS)

31:06.959 --> 31:08.584
And our... (RUS)

31:27.334 --> 31:28.376
Franek!

31:32.042 --> 31:34.417
Who will tend the cows?!

31:36.834 --> 31:39.834
You're not my mother!
You can't order me around.

31:40.001 --> 31:41.626
Cross yourself.

31:45.251 --> 31:48.542
You want to drink milk?
Then run to the pasture!

32:14.792 --> 32:17.876
Mother says, the Soviets stole our hen.

32:18.251 --> 32:21.876
Why did you let them do it?
Enough.

32:24.959 --> 32:29.334
Don't make them call her "mother."
Their mother died.

32:29.584 --> 32:32.417
This is my house, not yours.

32:32.792 --> 32:34.584
I do what I please.

32:40.251 --> 32:42.376
I'll feed the cows.

32:44.209 --> 32:46.917
Nothing is done properly here!

33:00.459 --> 33:04.251
Don't you mind the old hag.
She'll get used to you.

33:07.334 --> 33:08.542
Oh Lord,

33:08.751 --> 33:12.834
bless us and these Thy gifts,
which we are about to receive.

33:13.001 --> 33:16.834
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

34:44.751 --> 34:47.751
We are going to have a baby.

35:15.584 --> 35:17.584
Praised be the Lord.

35:26.667 --> 35:28.167
To our son.

35:32.042 --> 35:34.376
How do you know it's a son?

35:52.959 --> 35:54.626
Keep your eyes off her

35:55.084 --> 35:58.792
or you won't recognize yourself
in the mirror.

36:19.251 --> 36:22.626
- Is he back? (UKR)
- What do you want? (UKR)

36:23.459 --> 36:25.292
You're married. (UKR)

36:25.542 --> 36:27.751
What are you looking for?! (UKR)

36:28.209 --> 36:30.959
- Is he back or not? (UKR)
- Not! (UKR)

36:51.834 --> 36:53.501
Where have you been?!

36:54.626 --> 36:56.126
At my parents'.

36:57.876 --> 37:01.209
- Brought them some eggs.
- You were in Zawodzie.

37:04.501 --> 37:06.417
In Hapyna's house.

37:08.209 --> 37:12.459
I went to her because...
she's a midwife.

37:13.251 --> 37:16.876
To ask if we can...

37:17.292 --> 37:18.542
What?

37:20.084 --> 37:21.417
You know...

37:40.251 --> 37:42.834
I hear the school is open.

37:43.209 --> 37:46.834
I can give your kids a lift.

37:47.001 --> 37:48.251
To school?

37:49.917 --> 37:51.376
Zofia?

37:52.417 --> 37:54.501
Are you all right?

37:57.001 --> 37:59.584
Nothing's changed since yesterday.

38:00.334 --> 38:02.959
You saw each other, right?

38:04.042 --> 38:06.417
Yesterday? Ah, yeah.

38:07.501 --> 38:10.793
Kids, new times, a new teacher.

38:11.876 --> 38:15.209
We'll see what language
you'll end up speaking.

38:16.126 --> 38:17.876
Get changed.

38:18.376 --> 38:22.126
I need you to help
with the cabbage at noon.

38:22.917 --> 38:25.084
And you fry me some eggs.

38:25.251 --> 38:26.667
On bacon.

38:30.084 --> 38:32.209
We won't need this. (RUS)

38:32.334 --> 38:35.417
It's a superstition. (RUS)

38:36.042 --> 38:40.209
Just like your little crosses
and medallions. (RUS)

38:41.417 --> 38:44.251
Who is wearing one? Hands up. (RUS)

38:47.667 --> 38:50.917
Take them off and put
them on the desk. (RUS)

39:05.876 --> 39:07.167
You're alive...

39:11.626 --> 39:14.251
Praised be the Lord.

40:09.959 --> 40:14.167
...and provisions.
And anyone refusing to pay (RUS)

40:14.376 --> 40:17.251
will be considered
a counterrevolutionary. (RUS)

40:17.626 --> 40:21.417
Their land
will be incorporated into the kolhoz. (RUS)

40:21.584 --> 40:24.001
You want us to deliver at wartime? (UKR)

40:26.001 --> 40:28.876
- We are facing starvation. (UKR)
- Quiet! (UKR)

40:29.251 --> 40:31.876
What will we sow the fields with? (UKR)

40:44.834 --> 40:48.542
Now we have only one color! (RUS)

40:50.084 --> 40:51.584
The red one! (RUS)

40:55.334 --> 40:59.042
Now about the oppression
of the Polish landlords. (RUS)

41:02.542 --> 41:06.001
The Polish landlords and capitalists (UKR)

41:06.167 --> 41:08.751
oppressed
the people of Western Ukraine. (UKR)

41:09.542 --> 41:12.959
Bound them in chains of slavery
and oppression. (UKR)

41:17.251 --> 41:18.834
Where to? (UKR)

41:23.751 --> 41:25.292
And the little one? (UKR)

41:26.001 --> 41:28.667
The little one will go with us. (UKR)

42:00.417 --> 42:04.084
Whose child are you carrying there?

42:06.251 --> 42:08.667
Did he sweep your chimney?!

42:10.459 --> 42:12.292
I'm going to bed.

42:33.542 --> 42:36.001
NKVD! Open up! (RUS)

42:36.417 --> 42:39.292
- Skiba, Matvei Casimirovich? (RUS)
- What is it?

42:39.459 --> 42:41.417
- Silence! (RUS)
- Stop!

42:45.876 --> 42:47.459
Shut up, scum! (RUS)

42:48.167 --> 42:50.251
Where is the gun?! (RUS)

42:50.542 --> 42:53.376
Pack up your stuff and food! (RUS)

42:53.751 --> 42:55.751
Dress your kids! (RUS)

42:57.292 --> 42:59.917
Are you deaf, bitch? Move it! (RUS)

43:01.292 --> 43:03.209
You have half an hour! (RUS)

43:05.167 --> 43:08.376
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners

43:08.959 --> 43:12.126
now and at the hour of our death.

43:17.501 --> 43:18.834
Out of the way! (RUS)

43:27.126 --> 43:29.084
Load them up! (RUS)

43:29.417 --> 43:32.251
- Leave me alone!
- Move! (RUS)

43:48.459 --> 43:51.376
- Skiba, Matvei Casimirovich. (RUS)
- And family? (RUS)

43:51.626 --> 43:53.376
- Yes! (RUS)
- Car number 7. (RUS)

43:53.751 --> 43:55.917
Get out! Quick! (RUS)

43:56.209 --> 43:57.334
Move it! (RUS)

44:22.126 --> 44:27.334
It's retaliation for 1920,
when we beat the hell out of them.

44:33.376 --> 44:34.751
The Polish bloodsuckers (UKR)

44:35.501 --> 44:38.959
will not oppress our people (UKR)

44:39.126 --> 44:40.459
any longer! (UKR)

44:41.251 --> 44:43.834
- Yeah! (UKR)
- Bravo! That's right! (UKR)

44:45.084 --> 44:46.501
Open up. (RUS)

44:47.292 --> 44:50.959
Yet Poles still live here
and this is bad. (UKR)

44:52.292 --> 44:55.126
Because they cannot be trusted. (UKR)

44:55.251 --> 44:58.667
They will always remain enemies (UKR)

44:59.001 --> 45:01.792
of the working people of Ukraine! (UKR)

45:04.376 --> 45:05.876
Skiba, Zofia. (RUS)

45:06.042 --> 45:09.084
- Zofia, are you all right?
- Look after my farm.

45:09.251 --> 45:11.209
Are you all right, Zofia?

45:14.292 --> 45:18.084
Hostile blood will always (UKR)

45:18.334 --> 45:20.667
manifest itself, (UKR)

45:21.834 --> 45:23.959
even in the third generation! (UKR)

45:24.584 --> 45:27.376
- It will! (UKR)
- Deport them! (UKR)

45:27.959 --> 45:32.334
- Deport them! (UKR)
- Shuma, your mother was Polish! (UKR)

45:33.876 --> 45:36.376
- Shut up! (UKR)
- Dumb woman. (UKR)

45:37.251 --> 45:39.334
Shuma is right! (UKR)

46:11.751 --> 46:14.542
No. We have to deport all of them. (RUS)

46:14.876 --> 46:18.042
- You'll say one of them died. (UKR)
- No. (RUS)

46:18.834 --> 46:21.626
The corpses must reach
the destination, too. (RUS)

46:23.459 --> 46:27.084
You'll find someone else,
the numbers will match. (UKR)

46:27.292 --> 46:29.667
The rest of the vodka is yours. (UKR)

46:50.167 --> 46:52.667
Blessed art Thou among women,

46:53.751 --> 46:56.792
and blessed is the fruit
of Thy womb...

47:04.167 --> 47:06.167
Skiba, Zofia. (RUS)

47:09.667 --> 47:10.959
Get off! (RUS)

47:16.834 --> 47:18.001
Come on! (RUS)

47:24.459 --> 47:25.876
Step back! (RUS)

47:30.542 --> 47:31.626
Back! (RUS)

47:48.251 --> 47:50.501
Run to her father's house!

47:59.084 --> 48:01.459
Everything's going to be fine. (UKR)

48:01.667 --> 48:04.667
Haven't you suffered enough
because of her?! (UKR)

48:04.917 --> 48:05.917
Mom! (UKR)

48:14.209 --> 48:16.334
Take her clothes off! (UKR)

48:24.542 --> 48:25.917
Heat the water! (UKR)

48:27.126 --> 48:29.501
She can't stay here! (UKR)

48:30.001 --> 48:32.876
She's a runaway,
that's punished by death! (UKR)

48:35.334 --> 48:37.376
We can't feed her! (UKR)

48:38.292 --> 48:40.626
When did your water break? (UKR)

48:41.001 --> 48:42.251
When? (UKR)

48:42.417 --> 48:44.834
- I don't know. (UKR)
- You never know a thing! (UKR)

48:52.209 --> 48:53.667
I love you.

48:57.167 --> 48:58.209
Come on! (UKR)

48:59.001 --> 49:02.251
That's right. Come on, push! Push! (UKR)

49:05.917 --> 49:07.542
Hush! Come on! (UKR)

49:19.292 --> 49:20.667
Push!

49:37.001 --> 49:40.834
- There you are, scum! (RUS)
- What's the matter, Commander? (UKR)

49:41.251 --> 49:43.417
Where's the vodka? (RUS)

49:44.501 --> 49:46.001
I don't understand. (UKR)

49:47.792 --> 49:51.792
What is it you don't understand?
You're Pietya, right? (RUS)

49:55.042 --> 50:00.001
The NKVD deals with passports
and political matters. (RUS)

50:00.917 --> 50:05.084
The Militia is responsible
for registrations and public order. (RUS)

50:07.792 --> 50:12.501
Yet for that vodka I have to
shoot you personally. (RUS)

50:33.376 --> 50:35.001
Petro? (UKR)

50:37.251 --> 50:39.251
Why are you lying here? (UKR)

50:55.167 --> 50:56.792
It's cold here. (UKR)

50:56.959 --> 50:59.792
Petro... get up.

51:00.251 --> 51:01.501
Get up. (UKR)

51:04.334 --> 51:06.834
Get up, Petro! (UKR)

51:08.209 --> 51:09.209
Get up! (UKR)

51:13.209 --> 51:16.334
Petro! Get up... (UKR)

51:34.459 --> 51:36.042
Where were you?

51:36.251 --> 51:39.251
Tell the brat he can't dick around here.

51:39.417 --> 51:42.417
- One's got to work...
- Our house is empty!

52:59.334 --> 53:01.876
Do you think dad is alive?

53:02.251 --> 53:03.501
I don't know.

53:03.667 --> 53:06.751
One should pray and hope for the best.

53:06.917 --> 53:11.834
And if he died, who will get the farm?
You or me and Franek?

53:20.667 --> 53:22.584
Franek, get back here!

53:32.459 --> 53:33.792
Moshe!

53:44.251 --> 53:46.834
Maybe they are already at the gate?

53:50.667 --> 53:55.251
We want to welcome
the victorious German army (GER)

53:56.626 --> 53:58.251
with great joy (GER)

53:58.501 --> 54:00.334
and gratitude! (GER)

54:01.251 --> 54:05.167
We expected you to come
from the direction of Zawodzie. (UKR)

54:05.751 --> 54:07.792
Never mind that. (UKR)

54:08.792 --> 54:13.501
We are happy that our
new Ukrainian... (GER)

54:14.917 --> 54:20.417
state and the great Germany
will cooperate! (GER)

54:20.667 --> 54:24.126
Long live the Organization
of Ukrainian Nationalists! (UKR)

54:24.334 --> 54:27.251
Long live Stepan Bandera! (UKR)

54:27.459 --> 54:31.751
Long live the Führer, Adolf Hitler! (UKR)

54:38.417 --> 54:40.542
Let me go! (RUS)

54:46.959 --> 54:48.584
What are you doing?! (RUS)

55:11.917 --> 55:14.667
Are there any other Jews
in the village? (GER)

55:22.542 --> 55:23.876
Esther! (YID)

55:25.459 --> 55:28.584
There were kids, too.
A boy and two girls. (GER)

55:32.917 --> 55:35.126
Find all the others. (GER)

55:35.417 --> 55:37.834
And later bury the corpses. (GER)

55:39.209 --> 55:40.501
There's one!

55:53.209 --> 55:55.251
Where are they? (GER)

56:03.209 --> 56:07.042
Anyone who shelters the Jews
will be shot. (GER)

56:36.584 --> 56:41.417
- Those potatoes... Where are they?
- Maybe they stuck to Hawryluks' hands.

56:46.417 --> 56:50.001
I won't play with you anymore.
You're a Pole. (UKR)

56:53.751 --> 56:56.042
"Heyta" means turn right.

56:56.626 --> 56:59.334
"Giddyup" means forward. Go. Go.

56:59.792 --> 57:02.959
- Go.
- Dad, stop, I forgot my hoe.

57:03.376 --> 57:04.667
Whoa!

57:05.751 --> 57:09.334
- I'll come back on foot.
- Drive on. Go.

57:31.667 --> 57:34.042
And what about your children?

58:10.542 --> 58:13.917
Moshe has been here since summer.

58:20.001 --> 58:22.501
You were and are stupid!

58:22.667 --> 58:25.501
Hawryluk or the Poles will denounce you!

58:25.917 --> 58:30.292
They must be gone by tomorrow,
or I'll hand them over to the Germans!

58:32.959 --> 58:36.417
Don't you dare risk your life
for those Kikes.

58:37.251 --> 58:39.417
Nor mine nor your mother's.

58:40.667 --> 58:41.792
Zofia!

58:57.167 --> 58:59.501
- Can I drive?
- No.

58:59.876 --> 59:03.459
I need to take the food quota
to the Germans.

59:07.334 --> 59:09.459
I almost forgot.

59:10.001 --> 59:12.126
Hela wrote us.

59:14.751 --> 59:17.167
They have a little daughter.

01:00:07.667 --> 01:00:09.292
Good morning.

01:00:22.626 --> 01:00:25.417
What? Will you pierce me through? (UKR)

01:01:02.042 --> 01:01:04.209
Look for the Jews! (UKR)

01:01:10.959 --> 01:01:13.959
Hey, Jews! Koshies!

01:01:18.834 --> 01:01:20.209
What now?

01:01:25.292 --> 01:01:26.792
I will pay you! (UKR)

01:01:27.251 --> 01:01:32.126
I buried some golden rubles
in the woods! You'll be rich! (UKR)

01:01:32.334 --> 01:01:33.334
Rich! (uKR)

01:01:36.876 --> 01:01:40.917
But you have to give us shelter
for the whole winter. (UKR)

01:03:01.876 --> 01:03:05.959
My wife is sick! We need
some dog lard. (UKR)

01:03:06.209 --> 01:03:07.751
Quiet! (UKR)

01:03:08.251 --> 01:03:12.376
You will not falter to perform
the most dangerous deed, (UKR)

01:03:12.584 --> 01:03:15.501
if required for the good of the cause.
Repeat. (UKR)

01:03:16.001 --> 01:03:19.209
You will not falter to perform
the most dangerous deed, (UKR)

01:03:19.876 --> 01:03:22.084
- even if... (UKR)
- Well? (UKR)

01:03:23.167 --> 01:03:26.834
Can't you memorize that? Next one. (UKR)

01:03:27.251 --> 01:03:31.584
You shall receive the enemies of your
nation with hatred and deceit. (UKR)

01:03:40.417 --> 01:03:43.251
Your wife is not moving. (YID)

01:04:39.792 --> 01:04:41.917
Where is the money? (UKR)

01:04:42.959 --> 01:04:45.292
How much further? (UKR)

01:05:11.584 --> 01:05:12.751
Run. (UKR)

01:05:52.917 --> 01:05:55.584
They wrote on yours, too.

01:05:59.292 --> 01:06:02.459
Any news of Maciej? Is he alive?

01:06:04.834 --> 01:06:06.167
Maybe. Why?

01:06:06.667 --> 01:06:08.417
I'm just asking.

01:06:08.584 --> 01:06:12.792
Because I wanted to tell you that...
I don't...

01:06:13.251 --> 01:06:15.667
I don't have a woman. Yet.

01:06:19.001 --> 01:06:20.959
And if you'd only wish...

01:06:23.084 --> 01:06:26.501
- What is going on?
- The river brought something.

01:06:40.459 --> 01:06:41.876
It's the priest!

01:06:48.959 --> 01:06:50.834
Lord, have mercy...

01:06:52.834 --> 01:06:55.376
They are animals, not people.

01:06:55.876 --> 01:06:58.292
Animals do not torture.

01:06:59.626 --> 01:07:01.376
They mark the walls.

01:07:01.834 --> 01:07:06.834
"102" on the Ukrainian houses
and crosses on the Polish ones.

01:07:07.542 --> 01:07:11.084
We had four crosses,
<i>as</i> there were four of us,

01:07:11.251 --> 01:07:13.251
before you came back.

01:07:19.209 --> 01:07:21.834
Another hen went missing today.

01:08:17.667 --> 01:08:19.042
Carefully.

01:09:20.292 --> 01:09:22.334
Where are you going?

01:09:23.251 --> 01:09:25.126
We have no grain.

01:09:25.626 --> 01:09:28.959
We need a new dog,
padlocks and bolts.

01:09:29.167 --> 01:09:32.001
It's better to lock the house.

01:09:34.376 --> 01:09:36.584
Aren't you scared?

01:09:39.667 --> 01:09:42.834
Don't be stupid. They all know me.

01:09:43.376 --> 01:09:45.917
They knew the priest, too.

01:09:48.626 --> 01:09:50.042
Giddyup!

01:10:02.501 --> 01:10:05.251
We're running out of kerosene!

01:10:21.417 --> 01:10:23.584
That's the way to do it.

01:10:26.959 --> 01:10:29.626
When will daddy be back?

01:10:31.751 --> 01:10:33.501
Cross the red ones.

01:12:50.501 --> 01:12:53.792
I'll raise Skiba's children
like my own.

01:13:13.084 --> 01:13:17.126
One meter away from the head,
or the blood will stain your uniform. (GER)

01:13:17.459 --> 01:13:19.167
Understood? (GER)

01:13:48.417 --> 01:13:49.751
Stop! (UKR)

01:13:52.084 --> 01:13:54.251
Stand still! (UKR)

01:13:59.376 --> 01:14:04.251
Kwiatkowski proposed to you.
Why didn't you accept him?

01:14:04.542 --> 01:14:07.209
- For good luck. (UKR)
- God willing. (UKR)

01:15:00.751 --> 01:15:02.334
"Antoni."

01:15:03.376 --> 01:15:06.667
- "Wilk."
- His eyes are open.

01:15:18.417 --> 01:15:20.084
Who are you?

01:15:35.751 --> 01:15:40.251
- He doesn't look Jewish, but...
- It's my house, I'll do what I please.

01:16:01.834 --> 01:16:03.459
You're it!

01:16:29.834 --> 01:16:31.251
Here you are.

01:16:48.917 --> 01:16:51.001
Hit with all the surface.

01:16:55.626 --> 01:16:57.084
Whoa!

01:17:12.917 --> 01:17:15.417
What's a railwayman doing here? (UKR)

01:17:15.626 --> 01:17:17.959
I came to help. (UKR)

01:17:19.251 --> 01:17:21.626
With the farmwork. (UKR)

01:17:22.501 --> 01:17:25.917
You took a liking to Skiba's widow? (UKR)

01:17:27.376 --> 01:17:31.001
I'll assign you
to the next forced labor commission. (UKR)

01:17:31.209 --> 01:17:35.792
And tell her to bring the Germans
grain for the tax. (UKR)

01:17:36.542 --> 01:17:41.167
It's high time. And I need to see
the receipts for the milk. (UKR)

01:17:56.792 --> 01:17:59.834
- Name? (GER)
- Zofia Skiba, nee Glowacka.

01:18:00.126 --> 01:18:02.167
A hen, a cow. (UKR)

01:18:03.126 --> 01:18:04.667
And a horse. (UKR)

01:18:23.292 --> 01:18:26.001
- Do you know what honor is?
- No.

01:18:27.417 --> 01:18:30.876
Honor is this thing...

01:18:31.042 --> 01:18:34.001
that makes you keep your word.

01:18:34.959 --> 01:18:36.751
No matter what.

01:18:50.167 --> 01:18:51.334
When?

01:18:52.042 --> 01:18:53.209
Tomorrow.

01:19:01.626 --> 01:19:04.042
Leave that and go to bed.

01:19:27.292 --> 01:19:28.334
Stop! (RUS)

01:19:33.292 --> 01:19:34.751
A Pole? (RUS)

01:19:36.001 --> 01:19:38.584
You're lucky we are not Ukrainian. (RUS)

01:19:40.292 --> 01:19:44.501
Give us some food and moonshine
and we'll let you go. (RUS)

01:19:59.042 --> 01:20:00.667
How much did you get? (UKR)

01:20:00.876 --> 01:20:04.084
- As much as you wanted. (UKR)
- I wanted more! (UKR)

01:20:05.251 --> 01:20:07.251
Potatoes, potatoes... (UKR)

01:20:15.042 --> 01:20:19.501
- And then they took his eyes out.
- There are but women in our village.

01:20:20.251 --> 01:20:25.209
The men who weren't sent to Siberia
ended up as forced labor in Germany.

01:20:25.459 --> 01:20:27.084
All I know

01:20:27.501 --> 01:20:33.001
is that our Ukrainian neighbors
promised to warn us in case of danger.

01:20:33.167 --> 01:20:34.334
Got vodka?

01:20:38.376 --> 01:20:42.792
The Ukrainian Military Organization
and OUN carried out a thousand attacks,

01:20:43.626 --> 01:20:46.667
arsons, assaults, executions.

01:20:47.167 --> 01:20:49.167
They killed the Poles,

01:20:49.334 --> 01:20:53.084
and the Ukrainians who wanted to
come to terms with Poland.

01:20:56.251 --> 01:20:58.501
My boots are too tight.

01:21:00.167 --> 01:21:02.667
Go back and wait.
I'll report about the Kikes.

01:21:04.667 --> 01:21:07.001
- Thank you. (UKR)
- Godspeed. (UKR)

01:21:08.626 --> 01:21:10.542
God be with you. (UKR)

01:21:11.542 --> 01:21:13.126
Giddyup!

01:22:16.167 --> 01:22:19.584
An egg. An egg.

01:22:34.334 --> 01:22:37.917
The Krauts are finished.
Defeated at Stalingrad.

01:22:39.584 --> 01:22:41.667
We need to organize.

01:22:41.876 --> 01:22:45.626
The Germans are less dangerous
than the Ukrainian bands.

01:22:45.917 --> 01:22:47.917
I won't abandon my family.

01:22:53.001 --> 01:22:57.001
There's the transportation permit.
Send him to the station. (GER)

01:22:57.209 --> 01:22:59.792
- Is that clear? (GER)
- Yes, sir. The station. (GER)

01:23:00.084 --> 01:23:01.501
Come here. (UKR)

01:23:02.834 --> 01:23:04.459
Your papers. (UKR)

01:23:08.001 --> 01:23:10.042
Has Romek returned?

01:23:17.751 --> 01:23:19.084
Orlyk! (UKR)

01:23:20.042 --> 01:23:24.001
You knocked my teeth out
with the flail, remember? (UKR)

01:23:24.251 --> 01:23:26.251
Shut your face! (UKR)

01:23:53.209 --> 01:23:54.876
My late husband's.

01:24:24.501 --> 01:24:27.209
Where should I bury it?

01:24:46.751 --> 01:24:51.542
<i>You shall win the Ukrainian state
or die fighting for it!</i> (UKR)

01:24:51.876 --> 01:24:55.917
You won't allow anybody to profane
the glory and honor of your nation! (UKR)

01:25:01.626 --> 01:25:05.876
Remember the great days
of our struggle for freedom! (UKR)

01:26:14.334 --> 01:26:17.292
How would strangers know
where the Poles lived?

01:26:17.459 --> 01:26:20.209
The neighbors were informers.
Or killers.

01:26:20.751 --> 01:26:24.126
- We must defend ourselves.
- Who?

01:26:24.917 --> 01:26:27.834
And with what? They are armed.

01:26:29.501 --> 01:26:32.251
- Our Ukrainians will warn us.
- We're safe.

01:26:32.501 --> 01:26:34.792
Then why do we sleep in hideouts?

01:26:34.959 --> 01:26:38.251
You may sleep where you want.
I sleep at home.

01:26:42.334 --> 01:26:44.042
<i>And take pride...</i> (UKR)

01:26:46.251 --> 01:26:48.876
<i>...in continuing the fight...</i> (UKR)

01:26:53.251 --> 01:26:56.251
...for the glory
of Volodymyr's Trident! (UKR)

01:26:58.501 --> 01:27:01.251
Avenge the death of our
great warriors! (UKR)

01:27:01.667 --> 01:27:03.876
Don't discuss the cause with anybody. (UKR)

01:27:04.042 --> 01:27:06.792
<i>Discuss it with somebody!</i> (UKR)

01:27:22.376 --> 01:27:25.001
There's aunt Bronka.

01:27:36.501 --> 01:27:38.334
I'm Maciej's sister.

01:27:38.917 --> 01:27:41.459
Will you give us shelter?

01:27:45.751 --> 01:27:50.001
They attacked us at night,
just after St. Joseph's Day...

01:27:50.542 --> 01:27:52.292
surrounded the village.

01:27:52.876 --> 01:27:57.251
The Banderists entered first,
followed by the Ukrainians.

01:27:59.751 --> 01:28:02.292
The ones from Bialka, Jablonna...

01:28:03.667 --> 01:28:06.167
Kamionka, Wielkie Pole...

01:28:08.167 --> 01:28:10.126
Our neighbors.

01:28:17.209 --> 01:28:19.917
They slaughtered us with axes.

01:28:22.251 --> 01:28:25.084
Burned alive in barns.

01:28:26.792 --> 01:28:30.459
My little daughters, Ola and Henia...

01:28:39.376 --> 01:28:42.167
They searched farms and fields...

01:28:43.209 --> 01:28:45.626
finishing off the wounded.

01:28:51.251 --> 01:28:54.292
We spent the whole night in a ditch.

01:28:56.251 --> 01:28:58.501
And merciful God saved us.

01:29:04.501 --> 01:29:06.542
Zawodzie is on fire!

01:30:00.959 --> 01:30:05.584
They are burning whole villages.
Even if they don't find us...

01:30:05.792 --> 01:30:06.917
Sleep.

01:30:26.834 --> 01:30:29.667
- You'll be back tomorrow.
- I won't leave them.

01:30:29.917 --> 01:30:31.459
It's an order.

01:30:36.626 --> 01:30:38.876
They need a guide.

01:30:40.834 --> 01:30:42.459
Why you?

01:30:44.501 --> 01:30:46.584
They're going to Kustycze.

01:30:49.334 --> 01:30:51.501
It's my village.

01:31:04.542 --> 01:31:06.751
You're not going anywhere.

01:31:30.042 --> 01:31:31.750
Good morning.

01:31:35.001 --> 01:31:38.376
Can I ask you something?
Where's that secret group

01:31:38.584 --> 01:31:44.084
that plan to fight the Germans, and can't
protect us against forks and axes?

01:31:44.751 --> 01:31:47.001
This is going to change.

01:32:07.251 --> 01:32:09.542
Aren't you afraid of the Germans?

01:32:09.792 --> 01:32:11.959
They all hid in the cities.

01:32:39.917 --> 01:32:42.334
Kustycze is just behind these woods.

01:32:43.834 --> 01:32:47.501
And that clearing is at your right
by the oaks.

01:33:00.542 --> 01:33:02.584
They'll kill you.

01:33:03.667 --> 01:33:07.251
If they decide to do so,
this gun won't help me.

01:33:08.417 --> 01:33:11.251
Soldier's honor is my weapon.

01:33:12.167 --> 01:33:13.876
I'll go with you.

01:33:15.334 --> 01:33:17.167
All right. Just you.

01:33:19.001 --> 01:33:22.584
And you take cover in the woods.
Trybus, you're in charge.

01:33:29.251 --> 01:33:30.876
Zajdel!

01:33:31.126 --> 01:33:34.417
- Escort this man home in safety.
- Yes, sir.

01:33:42.626 --> 01:33:46.834
I came to tell you
that you mustn't fear.

01:33:47.917 --> 01:33:51.001
Nothing will happen here. It is over.

01:33:52.667 --> 01:33:54.917
We have a truce with the Poles.

01:33:55.542 --> 01:33:58.834
Don't look at me like I was a bandit. (UKR)

01:33:59.001 --> 01:34:03.459
It's time to think about he harvest.
God bless. (UKR)

01:34:03.792 --> 01:34:06.209
<i>- All nations are brothers.</i> (UKR)
- God bless. (UKR)

01:34:06.501 --> 01:34:09.251
Each has the right to live (UKR)

01:34:09.417 --> 01:34:13.334
and aim for the wellbeing
of its people. (UKR)

01:34:14.959 --> 01:34:19.959
But it deeply wrong
and disadvantageous (UKR)

01:34:20.917 --> 01:34:25.167
to dissociate the wellbeing
from decency. (UKR)

01:34:26.251 --> 01:34:31.501
The world is infected
with intemperate devotion (UKR)

01:34:32.167 --> 01:34:35.834
to one's fatherland, to one's nation. (UKR)

01:34:36.251 --> 01:34:40.001
And such devotion may be measured (UKR)

01:34:40.251 --> 01:34:44.334
by the strength of hatred towards
other nations. (UKR)

01:35:08.501 --> 01:35:10.542
Cpt. Zygmunt Krzemieniecki. (UKR)

01:35:11.251 --> 01:35:13.542
It's me. I am the emissary. (UKR)

01:35:15.126 --> 01:35:17.542
The Polish Government in London
and OUN (UKR)

01:35:17.876 --> 01:35:21.792
agreed that both sides
should meet unarmed. (UKR)

01:35:27.001 --> 01:35:29.501
I've read your poems. (UKR)

01:35:32.084 --> 01:35:35.209
The one about
the two fatherlands is very good. (UKR)

01:35:41.459 --> 01:35:44.751
With whom do I have the honor? (UKR)

01:35:46.751 --> 01:35:48.501
With the free Ukraine! (UKR)

01:35:52.501 --> 01:35:53.501
Go! (UKR)

01:36:04.126 --> 01:36:05.626
The Banderists!

01:36:20.751 --> 01:36:22.792
<i>The Holy Scripture says,</i> (UKR)

01:36:24.167 --> 01:36:27.459
"When the wheat
sprouted and formed heads, (UKR)

01:36:27.917 --> 01:36:30.334
<i>then the weeds also appeared.</i> (UKR)

01:36:31.251 --> 01:36:35.042
The owner's servants came to him
and said, 'Sir, (UKR)

01:36:35.501 --> 01:36:40.292
didn't you sow good seed in your field?
Where then did the weeds come from?' (UKR)

01:36:41.167 --> 01:36:42.959
'An enemy did this,' (UKR)

01:36:43.542 --> 01:36:45.501
he replied." (UKR)

01:36:47.917 --> 01:36:50.167
<i>Let us not delude ourselves,</i> (UKR)

01:36:51.084 --> 01:36:55.417
<i>that there is a nation
free of this poison.</i> (UKR)

01:36:56.084 --> 01:37:01.251
Let each member of every nation
and every faith (UKR)

01:37:02.042 --> 01:37:04.376
feel like they were at home. (UKR)

01:37:04.834 --> 01:37:08.917
And being a member
of a particular faith (UKR)

01:37:09.209 --> 01:37:12.459
should not imply wrongdoings, (UKR)

01:37:13.334 --> 01:37:15.417
evil thoughts, (UKR)

01:37:17.459 --> 01:37:19.042
and bad deeds. (UKR)

01:37:29.626 --> 01:37:34.917
"The servants asked him, 'Do you want
us to go and pull them up?' (UKR)

01:37:35.334 --> 01:37:37.667
And he answered, 'No, (UKR)

01:37:38.251 --> 01:37:43.792
because while you are pulling the weeds,
you may uproot the wheat with them. (UKR)

01:37:44.251 --> 01:37:48.959
Let both grow together
until the harvest. (UKR)

01:37:50.292 --> 01:37:53.334
At that time
I will tell the harvesters: (UKR)

01:37:53.959 --> 01:37:59.209
First collect the weeds and tie them
in bundles to be burned. (UKR)

01:37:59.376 --> 01:38:02.251
Then gather the wheat and
bring it into my barn." (UKR)

01:38:02.876 --> 01:38:05.251
Let people of all faiths (UKR)

01:38:05.626 --> 01:38:08.292
and, if there is such need, (UKR)

01:38:08.459 --> 01:38:10.042
of all languages, (UKR)

01:38:10.376 --> 01:38:13.751
spread the Word of God. (UKR)

01:38:14.459 --> 01:38:16.209
Brothers and sisters, (UKR)

01:38:16.542 --> 01:38:19.251
we need to
cleanse the Ukrainian soil! (UKR)

01:38:21.001 --> 01:38:23.251
<i>Let the villages</i>

01:38:23.667 --> 01:38:29.292
with brick houses or those
that are difficult to access

01:38:29.876 --> 01:38:33.251
receive all Polish refugees.

01:38:34.251 --> 01:38:37.751
I need to get back to my family.
Do you know a trustworthy Ukrainian?

01:38:37.917 --> 01:38:40.751
- Arm yourselves!
- After the mass.

01:38:40.917 --> 01:38:42.084
Unite.

01:38:42.626 --> 01:38:45.209
Organize self-defence squads.

01:38:45.792 --> 01:38:48.584
Don't wait until you are butchered!

01:38:48.792 --> 01:38:52.751
We need to fill the rivers
with Polish blood, (UKR)

01:38:52.917 --> 01:38:57.001
because Ukraine has to be pure
like water in a glass! (UKR)

01:38:57.209 --> 01:39:02.459
You will not falter to perform
the most dangerous deed... (UKR)

01:39:03.959 --> 01:39:06.876
...if required for the good
of the cause! (UKR)

01:39:08.959 --> 01:39:12.959
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit. Amen. (UKR)

01:39:14.167 --> 01:39:18.001
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit. Amen. (UKR)

01:39:18.209 --> 01:39:21.251
Let your harvest be plentiful. (UKR)

01:39:23.209 --> 01:39:25.667
With hatred and deceit... (UKR)

01:39:25.876 --> 01:39:30.084
...you shall receive the enemies
of your nation. (UKR)

01:39:30.792 --> 01:39:33.917
- Glory to Ukraine! (UKR)
- Glory to the heroes! (UKR)

01:39:34.084 --> 01:39:36.084
Glory to Ukraine! (UKR)

01:39:36.501 --> 01:39:38.917
...deliver us from all dangers...

01:39:44.084 --> 01:39:47.126
...reconcile us with Thy Son...
- Banderists!

01:40:07.209 --> 01:40:08.959
Get out. (UKR)

01:40:14.584 --> 01:40:15.584
Come.

01:40:18.042 --> 01:40:19.042
Come.

01:40:24.251 --> 01:40:26.334
Look for those Poles! (UKR)

01:41:41.584 --> 01:41:43.126
Light him up. (UKR)

01:43:00.501 --> 01:43:03.542
For oppressing our nation! (UKR)

01:43:03.876 --> 01:43:05.209
Death! (UKR)

01:43:06.209 --> 01:43:08.251
For the land of our fathers! (UKR)

01:43:08.376 --> 01:43:10.542
Death to the Poles! (UKR)

01:43:11.001 --> 01:43:15.126
- For Volhynia! (UKR)
- Death to the Poles! (UKR)

01:43:15.334 --> 01:43:17.834
For free Ukraine! (UKR)

01:43:18.251 --> 01:43:21.001
Death to the Poles! (UKR)

01:45:29.792 --> 01:45:33.667
- Are there any Poles here? (UKR)
- There are! All dead. (UKR)

01:45:34.917 --> 01:45:38.667
Get your stuff,
we'll burn everything. (UKR)

01:45:48.876 --> 01:45:50.959
Go to your sister's. (UKR)

01:45:55.626 --> 01:45:57.542
But walk slowly. (UKR)

01:45:58.251 --> 01:46:01.751
The Ukrainians fear nothing.
They won't run away. (UKR)

01:48:18.876 --> 01:48:20.292
A Pole! (UKR)

01:49:43.209 --> 01:49:45.584
You have to go that way. (GER)

01:50:16.876 --> 01:50:18.042
Stop! (UKR)

01:50:22.334 --> 01:50:24.501
Where are you going? (UKR)

01:50:28.459 --> 01:50:30.209
We're Ukrainian. (UKR)

01:50:32.292 --> 01:50:35.126
But you are dressed like a Pole. (UKR)

01:50:39.209 --> 01:50:41.792
We stole from the Poles. (UKR)

01:50:42.667 --> 01:50:45.626
Cross yourself
and say the Lord's Prayer.

01:50:57.417 --> 01:51:02.667
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name... (UKR)

01:51:03.042 --> 01:51:05.626
- Thy kingdom... (UKR)
- I am hungry. (UKR)

01:51:08.626 --> 01:51:12.876
- He's hungry. (UKR)
- We nearly killed a Ukrainian girl. (UKR)

01:51:13.459 --> 01:51:18.376
So we stuck this kid
into a bale of straw (UKR)

01:51:19.084 --> 01:51:22.376
- and set it on fire. (UKR)
- Whom will you visit? (UKR)

01:51:24.917 --> 01:51:26.667
Polishtshukova. (UKR)

01:51:26.917 --> 01:51:29.417
How did this Polish woman wail! (UKR)

01:51:30.501 --> 01:51:34.084
Ivanko had to silence her
with a fork. (UKR)

01:51:35.251 --> 01:51:39.751
I know her. She has a daughter. (UKR)

01:51:42.251 --> 01:51:43.501
A son. (UKR)

01:51:43.751 --> 01:51:46.001
And the father's hair... (UKR)

01:51:46.834 --> 01:51:50.251
turned white in half an hour. (UKR)

01:51:51.751 --> 01:51:56.834
And I personally cut the scalp
off his head. (UKR)

01:54:24.001 --> 01:54:27.251
You have to kill her.
Otherwise you'll all be dead! (UKR)

01:54:35.292 --> 01:54:38.001
You are my brother. (UKR)

01:54:41.251 --> 01:54:45.667
That's why you are still alive.
Because I'm your brother. (UKR)

01:54:54.209 --> 01:54:58.542
All others who refuse
to serve Stepan Bandera, (UKR)

01:54:59.917 --> 01:55:01.959
get a bullet in their head. (UKR)

01:55:04.417 --> 01:55:08.584
Your wife is a Pole.
You can't help her. (UKR)

01:55:11.834 --> 01:55:13.917
But you and the kids will live. (UKR)

01:55:54.834 --> 01:55:56.876
<i>Rock-a-bye...</i>

01:55:57.292 --> 01:55:59.501
<i>Rock-a-bye...</i>

01:56:00.251 --> 01:56:03.376
<i>in your limewood cradle...</i>

01:56:21.251 --> 01:56:23.751
Let her go! She's Polish!

01:56:26.042 --> 01:56:28.626
- Of your very own blood!
- Shut up!

01:56:28.834 --> 01:56:30.626
You fancied a Banderist?

01:56:30.876 --> 01:56:32.959
See what they do to our babies!

01:56:59.334 --> 01:57:00.584
Let's move on.
