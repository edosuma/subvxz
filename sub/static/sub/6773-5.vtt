00:04.549 --> 00:07.069
Very sweet... carrot... pancakes I smell?

00:09.069 --> 00:10.069
How divine.

00:11.491 --> 00:15.491
The aroma... spiced warm apple cider!

00:17.987 --> 00:21.180
And the smell of... smoke...

00:22.180 --> 00:24.139
Smoke?
Smoke?!

00:29.139 --> 00:30.139
Rarity!

00:31.649 --> 00:34.142
You ruined the surprise! I was going to serve you breakfast in bed!

01:18.875 --> 01:20.836
Well, good mornin', Rarity!

01:20.836 --> 01:23.492
Father! Mother!

01:23.492 --> 01:27.432
I'll have you know that Sweetie Belle here cooked this yummy lookin' breakfast all on her own.

01:29.432 --> 01:31.138
I... figured.

01:33.138 --> 01:35.138
I didn't know you could burn juice.

01:35.587 --> 01:37.291
I've been giving her lessons.

01:37.291 --> 01:42.291
I wouldn't be surprised if she's got a cutie mark in fancy cookin' by the time we get back from our vacation.

01:42.462 --> 01:46.104
Vacation? Is that this week?! As in starting this very instant this week?!

01:49.104 --> 01:51.104
Let me guess, apple sauce?

01:51.640 --> 01:53.640
No. Toast.

01:53.901 --> 01:57.539
We're gonna have the bestest time two sisters could ever have!

01:57.539 --> 01:59.539
I'm gonna go grab my stuff from dad's wagon.

02:01.632 --> 02:07.569
So, now, when you say 'a week'... is that, um, seven whole days?

02:07.569 --> 02:11.251
And six nights, I know! Such a short time to spend with your little sis'.

02:12.251 --> 02:13.251
You gonna eat that?

02:13.898 --> 02:16.651
But I've got such a long to do list...

02:17.651 --> 02:22.074
I suppose 'spend time with your sister' will just have to be added to the list.

02:25.074 --> 02:27.074
Just a few necessities.

02:31.562 --> 02:34.562
Now, let's get that kitchen all cleaned up.

02:34.806 --> 02:38.226
Cleaned up? But we haven't even eaten yet.

02:38.226 --> 02:40.226
Well now, Sweetie Belle,
I appreciate the gesture

02:40.980 --> 02:44.256
but we simply can't eat this breakfast, it's burnt.

02:44.256 --> 02:45.127
It's not that burnt.

02:47.127 --> 02:50.127
Never fear, my dear, I'll get a proper breakfast going.

02:56.270 --> 02:57.270
Can I help?

02:58.331 --> 03:02.331
Of course, in one moment, Sweetie Belle. Let me just get things started.

03:11.884 --> 03:15.758
Rarity !
I thought you said I was gonna help!

03:15.758 --> 03:19.104
You are! You can...

03:20.104 --> 03:22.104
put the garnish on the plates.

03:22.601 --> 03:24.160
You mean this parsley?

03:26.160 --> 03:29.160
Okay, now easy! It has to be just right! No need to rush.

03:29.530 --> 03:31.431
No! That's too slow.

03:31.431 --> 03:33.070
Careful! Back up!

03:54.021 --> 03:56.021
There are some things I must attend to.

03:56.610 --> 03:59.324
Can you take the dirty towels to the laundry room?

04:00.324 --> 04:03.242
No problem, I'll make myself useful!

04:14.242 --> 04:19.076
- Sweetie Belle!
- I told you I'd make myself useful. Surprise!

04:19.076 --> 04:24.076
Oh my... You washed my incredibly expensive one-of-a-kind designer crochet wool sweater!

04:24.410 --> 04:27.139
Do you know how hard these things are to come by?

04:27.139 --> 04:28.139
What's the big deal?

04:28.240 --> 04:33.240
The big deal is that in the heat of the sun, wool... shrinks...

04:33.810 --> 04:36.810
Oh... sorry.

04:38.815 --> 04:42.228
Well. Back to work. I must create.

04:43.228 --> 04:44.081
Sorry...?

04:45.081 --> 04:48.081
Stay out of trouble, okay.
Please?

04:48.663 --> 04:51.663
I just want to do something nice for my sister...

04:55.708 --> 05:00.165
I'm so bored! When is Rarity gonna finish her work?

05:02.165 --> 05:04.165
Stay out of trouble, okay?

05:07.658 --> 05:09.555
I never got in trouble for drawing.

05:15.555 --> 05:17.043
This needs something...

05:25.043 --> 05:27.043
Hi, Rarity! I made a special drawing for y-

05:29.596 --> 05:32.199
Oh no! Did you use these gems?!

05:32.199 --> 05:36.119
Well, yes, but I know you'll have more in your work room...

05:36.119 --> 05:39.119
But these are extremely rare baby blue sapphires!

05:39.288 --> 05:42.288
I need them for an outfit for an extremely important client!

05:42.834 --> 05:44.023
Oh... sorry.

05:46.023 --> 05:49.023
Sweetie Belle, what am I going to do with you?

05:49.899 --> 05:52.899
Oh! We could paint together, we could ride bikes, play chess,

05:52.964 --> 05:55.401
sing a song, catch frogs, pillow fight...

05:55.401 --> 05:57.127
That's not what I meant!

05:58.127 --> 06:00.127
Now I have to go and find some more of these gems!

06:00.442 --> 06:02.442
- I'll go with you and help!
- No!

06:05.500 --> 06:07.500
No... thank you.

06:07.595 --> 06:11.499
You can help by picking up these papers and stacking them, neatly.

06:11.499 --> 06:15.499
Put the pens and pencils back exactly where you found them, and please

06:15.833 --> 06:20.670
find something to do that doesn't create a large mess for me to clean up.

06:21.670 --> 06:24.240
Geez Louise, can't I do anything right?

06:33.240 --> 06:34.240
Sweetie Belle!

06:35.370 --> 06:36.081
I'm back!

06:37.081 --> 06:38.081
Sweetie Belle?

06:41.827 --> 06:43.295
Surprise!

06:44.295 --> 06:46.295
My... my...

06:46.500 --> 06:48.303
My inspiration room!

06:49.303 --> 06:52.303
What did you do? What did you do?!

06:52.392 --> 06:56.295
When I saw the big mess in your room, I thought I'd clean it up for you.

06:56.295 --> 07:00.103
This wasn't a mess! It was organized chaos!

07:00.103 --> 07:05.103
I was just about finished planning my new fashion line, and, and you, you, you went and, and you

07:05.557 --> 07:07.557
you put everything away!

07:07.559 --> 07:10.449
But every time I make a mess, you get upset!

07:10.449 --> 07:13.206
But this was MY mess, in MY house!

07:14.206 --> 07:16.206
And now I have to start from scratch!

07:16.601 --> 07:20.033
But... I thought I would make you happy!

07:21.033 --> 07:23.033
Happy? Happy?!

07:28.572 --> 07:30.257
I just need some time alone.

07:43.257 --> 07:45.004
How's the sleepover at Rarity's going?

07:46.004 --> 07:47.004
Why, it's smashing!

07:49.946 --> 07:54.406
I just wish we could do something special together that didn't include me goofing anything up.

07:55.406 --> 07:56.406
The Sisterhooves Social!

07:56.956 --> 07:59.148
Applejack and I do it every year!

07:59.148 --> 08:03.148
You and Rarity can compete against other sister teams in all these neat events!

08:03.425 --> 08:05.425
That sounds like the perfect way for us to hang out!

08:05.593 --> 08:07.190
Rarity will think it's an excellent idea.

08:08.190 --> 08:10.190
What a ridiculous idea!

08:10.697 --> 08:13.254
A contest at Sweet Apple Acres?

08:13.254 --> 08:16.254
It doesn't sound... very... clean.

08:17.589 --> 08:20.589
So what? Now you're back to hating messes?

08:20.791 --> 08:23.230
Sweetie Belle, watch your tongue!

08:23.230 --> 08:25.190
I am still your big sister.

08:25.190 --> 08:29.190
Right! And any sister who cares about her sister goes!

08:29.541 --> 08:32.541
Sweetie Belle...! Honestly!

08:32.623 --> 08:36.456
Playing silly little games in the dirt is just... uncouth!

08:36.456 --> 08:38.438
With or without a sister.

08:40.438 --> 08:45.438
Well then! Maybe, maybe I'll try the Sisterhooves Social without a sister!

08:45.924 --> 08:50.541
In fact, I think I'll try the rest of my life without a sister!

08:52.541 --> 08:55.541
I'm the one who's ruining your life?! Really?!

08:55.899 --> 09:00.109
Have you looked around this place? I'm the one who'd be better off with no sister!

09:01.109 --> 09:04.109
Well it looks like we finally agree on something.

09:04.154 --> 09:07.154
- Neither of us needs a sister!
- Deal!

09:07.365 --> 09:09.365
Deal! Goodbye, un-sister!

09:17.485 --> 09:22.211
'Uncouth'? She said the Sisterhooves Social was 'uncouth'?

09:23.211 --> 09:24.037
Yeah, uncouth!

09:27.037 --> 09:28.037
Wait. What's uncouth?

09:28.865 --> 09:32.708
It's not just the Social. She thinks I'm uncouth.

09:32.708 --> 09:35.196
Honey, Rarity thinks everything's uncouth.

09:37.196 --> 09:38.196
What's 'uncouth'?

09:38.847 --> 09:41.847
It means 'uncivil'. Y'know, 'bad mannered'?

09:41.928 --> 09:43.082
Exactly.

09:44.082 --> 09:46.082
Sweetie Belle, just give Rarity some time.

09:46.092 --> 09:48.092
She'll come around. Sisters always do.

09:49.360 --> 09:51.360
Not sisters like Rarity.

09:51.960 --> 09:55.219
Come on, now. Apple Bloom and I got some chores to finish up on.

09:55.219 --> 09:56.219
Maybe you can help!

09:56.664 --> 09:58.664
You sure you want me to help?

09:58.750 --> 10:00.750
I just mess everything up!

10:00.828 --> 10:03.019
Oh come on, that's just stinkin' thinkin'. Watch!

10:11.019 --> 10:12.019
Good catch there, Apple Bloom!

10:18.668 --> 10:20.370
This is a chore?

10:20.370 --> 10:24.370
Since we can't sell the bruised apples, we gotta collect them all for the pigs to eat.

10:26.654 --> 10:29.336
It's a lot of work, so we make a game of it.

10:29.336 --> 10:30.138
Wanna try?

10:31.138 --> 10:31.138
Okay.

10:35.445 --> 10:37.445
You're right, it is hard work.

10:37.873 --> 10:39.274
That's why we do it...

10:39.274 --> 10:40.274
- Together!
- Together!

10:41.845 --> 10:44.845
Rarity never wants to do chores together.

10:46.991 --> 10:48.958
All that work ruined...

10:48.958 --> 10:50.626
thanks to Sweetie Belle!

10:52.626 --> 10:55.182
Oh my. It's usually a big mess in here.

10:58.182 --> 10:59.182
Idea!

10:59.855 --> 11:01.855
This is genius!

11:02.977 --> 11:06.635
I shall call it 'full spectrum fashions'!

11:06.635 --> 11:08.635
If Sweetie Belle hadn't-

11:10.977 --> 11:12.307
Well, no matter.

11:12.307 --> 11:15.259
She still shouldn't have touched my things without permission. Hm!

11:17.259 --> 11:19.259
Apple Bloom! You're up!

11:27.376 --> 11:30.376
You're making... grape juice?

11:30.748 --> 11:32.748
Rarity would call the fashion police on me

11:32.945 --> 11:36.166
if I got grape juice anywhere near her precious outfits.

11:36.166 --> 11:37.166
Well that's silly!

11:39.369 --> 11:40.369
Apple Bloom!

11:40.480 --> 11:42.480
Please, Applejack, she didn't mean-

11:44.720 --> 11:47.049
How d'you like them graps, y'little whippersnapper!

11:52.049 --> 11:55.049
Now to get these fabrics washed for my fabulous new line.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.219
My favourite sweater...

11:58.219 --> 12:00.118
I just can't believe that Sweetie Belle-

12:07.118 --> 12:12.118
Opal, Opal! It's as if Sweetie Belle knew the sweater was perfect for you.

12:13.440 --> 12:16.440
And Sweetie Belle should consider herself perfectly lucky

12:16.458 --> 12:19.458
that this thoughtlessness act turned out all right.

12:23.495 --> 12:24.495
Apple Bloom!

12:24.741 --> 12:25.077
Got it, sis'!

12:31.077 --> 12:32.077
It's as if they were just one pony.

12:34.306 --> 12:36.306
Way to corral some critters, sis'!

12:36.445 --> 12:38.177
You could've just asked.

12:40.177 --> 12:42.177
Rarity never high-hoofs me...

12:44.595 --> 12:48.340
Perfect! Just one more, and this ensemble is fini!

12:50.340 --> 12:51.029
Sweetie Belle!

12:52.029 --> 12:54.029
Where's her silly little arts and crafts project?

13:04.453 --> 13:09.437
Oh, Sweetie Belle! My one and only sister! What have I done?!

13:10.437 --> 13:16.153
All the time I could have spent with you was wasted complaining and wishing you were gone!

13:16.153 --> 13:19.153
Woe is me!

13:19.296 --> 13:21.008
No! I must get her back!

13:21.008 --> 13:27.008
I must! As Celestia is my witness I shall never be sisterless again!

13:34.259 --> 13:39.259
Sweetie Belle!
Oh, I have been galloping all over looking for you. I-

13:41.438 --> 13:47.125
Oh hello, un-sister. What are you doing here? Better be careful. You might get some dust on you.

13:49.125 --> 13:55.125
Oh Sweetie Belle, I want to apologize. I am not better off without a sister.

13:55.741 --> 13:57.741
I'm not better off without a sister either.

13:57.869 --> 14:01.418
Spending the day with Applejack and Apple Bloom made me realize that.

14:02.418 --> 14:05.277
Oh, Sweetie, you don't know how happy I am to hear-

14:06.277 --> 14:09.277
And that's why I'm adopting Applejack as my big sister!

14:09.960 --> 14:10.667
What?!

14:11.667 --> 14:12.066
- What?!
- What?!

14:13.066 --> 14:15.066
A sister is someone who loves and takes care of another sister.

14:15.971 --> 14:18.671
Applejack's a real sister.

14:20.671 --> 14:23.671
Hold on, Sweetie Belle. Don't get ahead of yourself here.

14:23.727 --> 14:26.586
Besides, she's MY big sister!

14:27.586 --> 14:28.586
Yeah... um...

14:28.768 --> 14:31.768
Or... maybe she should be YOUR sister

14:31.870 --> 14:35.341
so she could teach you what a good sister is supposed to be!

14:37.341 --> 14:39.140
Actually, I-

14:39.140 --> 14:42.140
But I don't need lessons on being a good sister, I promise!

14:42.979 --> 14:45.755
Listen, I'll show you how to cook my favorite quiche!

14:45.755 --> 14:49.013
Or, I'll show you the proper way to beautify your mane.

14:50.013 --> 14:52.013
Won't that be fun? Hm?

14:53.174 --> 14:59.134
You want me to go home with you, so WE can do what YOU wanna do?

14:59.134 --> 15:01.130
Uh... yes?

15:02.130 --> 15:03.130
Just forget it!

15:04.690 --> 15:06.636
We're still sisters, right?

15:08.636 --> 15:11.101
Well, that apology went swimmingly.

15:12.101 --> 15:16.101
Applejack, why do you have to be so good and make me look so bad?

15:17.467 --> 15:21.318
Oh Rarity, once again you're thinking about yourself.

15:21.318 --> 15:23.318
Being sisters is a give and take.

15:23.950 --> 15:27.864
You've been doing a whole lot of taking, but you haven't been doing a whole lot of giving.

15:28.864 --> 15:30.506
But of course I give!

15:30.506 --> 15:33.506
I give lessons. Reasonable demands.

15:33.809 --> 15:36.484
But you never give in.

15:36.484 --> 15:40.484
Being sisters is like... apple pie.

15:40.783 --> 15:45.298
You can have amazing apples, and you can have a wonderfully crispy crust

15:45.298 --> 15:49.298
but only together, can you have a perfect apple pie.

15:50.730 --> 15:56.558
But apart, all we are is just a pile of mush and some crumbly dry mess...

15:57.558 --> 15:59.558
I know what I need to do!

15:59.636 --> 16:01.566
I just hope it isn't too late!

16:10.566 --> 16:13.566
Well, I guess it's a good thing Rarity isn't here.

16:13.772 --> 16:16.230
Do I see 'uncouth' written all over this contest?

16:18.230 --> 16:20.230
Look at the size of that pig!

16:20.528 --> 16:22.469
He sure is a cutie.

16:22.469 --> 16:25.014
That's the last word Rarity would use.

16:25.014 --> 16:28.014
Oh my, what a repulsive monstrosity!

16:28.351 --> 16:30.081
This thing needs a head to toe makeover!

16:32.081 --> 16:33.081
It's almost time!

16:34.113 --> 16:38.113
Well, you two have fun... sure wish I had a sister to run the race with...

16:40.760 --> 16:42.178
You do now!

16:42.178 --> 16:44.178
AB and I figured since we do this every year...

16:44.779 --> 16:47.307
...I'd like you to borrow my sister so you can give it a try!

16:47.307 --> 16:48.125
Sister for a day.

16:49.125 --> 16:50.125
No way!

16:50.427 --> 16:52.076
One. Day.

16:54.076 --> 16:55.076
One. Day.

16:57.094 --> 16:58.094
Is this thing on?

16:58.745 --> 17:00.216
I don't think this thing is on...

17:01.216 --> 17:02.216
Hello!

17:02.654 --> 17:06.060
What is that?
You have to say so.

17:06.060 --> 17:08.060
Confangled modern doohickeys...

17:09.211 --> 17:12.194
Now, the event you've all been waiting for!

17:12.194 --> 17:18.194
The Sister Soci- The Socialhoof- Oh, dabnabbit, you know, the big race!

17:18.742 --> 17:21.742
We have five teams this year fer the event!

17:21.875 --> 17:24.796
So y'all head on up to the finish line, y'hear?

17:25.796 --> 17:29.682
Eh? The start line! You coulda said.

17:29.682 --> 17:30.424
That's us.

17:31.424 --> 17:33.068
One. Day.

17:33.068 --> 17:34.068
Good luck!

17:34.531 --> 17:36.355
And may the best sisters win!

17:37.355 --> 17:38.355
On your marks...

17:39.631 --> 17:41.013
Get set...

17:43.013 --> 17:45.013
Gooooo!

17:53.553 --> 17:55.107
You okay, Applejack?

18:06.107 --> 18:07.107
Applejack, help!

18:32.582 --> 18:34.582
You can do it, sister!

19:20.982 --> 19:23.173
Oh, so close!

19:23.173 --> 19:24.173
You almost won!

19:24.574 --> 19:27.222
Thank you, Applejack! You were amazing!

19:27.222 --> 19:28.222
I don't even care that we didn't win.

19:28.932 --> 19:31.082
That was so much fun! Huh?

19:36.082 --> 19:37.082
Rarity?

19:40.936 --> 19:42.267
Wait, where's Applejack?

19:44.267 --> 19:45.267
I don't get it...

19:47.334 --> 19:50.238
We switched places over at the very first mudhole.

19:51.238 --> 19:54.238
So... we did the whole competition together?

19:54.953 --> 19:59.473
That we did, little sister.
Well, except for the start line.

19:59.473 --> 20:01.473
But you finished together!

20:01.487 --> 20:04.487
You mean... you were all in on it?

20:05.641 --> 20:07.641
You did this for me?

20:07.867 --> 20:10.711
Us. I did it for us.

20:12.711 --> 20:16.711
You see? We are apple pie!

20:17.976 --> 20:19.260
I'll explain later.

20:19.260 --> 20:22.260
For now, I think we deserve a celebration!

20:24.299 --> 20:25.076
Where?

20:25.076 --> 20:26.076
The spa, of course.

20:30.260 --> 20:32.260
No, I, I, I'm serious.

20:35.486 --> 20:38.486
Very well then, what shall we write to the Princess?

20:38.703 --> 20:39.703
I'll start.

20:39.704 --> 20:43.345
Having a sister is just about the bestest thing in the world.

20:43.345 --> 20:45.108
But it sure isn't the easiest.

20:45.108 --> 20:48.108
I agree that being sisters is a wonderful thing...

20:48.414 --> 20:50.128
but it takes teamwork.

20:51.128 --> 20:53.128
Sometimes it's about compromising...

20:55.219 --> 20:58.219
Sometimes it's about accepting each others' differences...

20:59.755 --> 21:02.625
But mostly, it's about having fun together.

21:03.625 --> 21:07.204
Even if it means getting your hooves a little bit dirty.

21:07.204 --> 21:08.204
A lot dirty.

21:09.732 --> 21:12.397
- A little bit dirty.
- A lot dirty!

21:12.397 --> 21:15.397
- A little bit dirty!
- A lot!

21:15.461 --> 21:17.154
Hold it, hold it!

21:17.154 --> 21:22.154
How about 'a medium amount of dirty, not too little, not too much, just right'?

21:22.423 --> 21:23.000
Deal!
