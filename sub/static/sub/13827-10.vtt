12:11.690 --> 12:13.984
But today is going to be different.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.528
Today, I'm proud to bring you...

12:16.612 --> 12:18.989
(DRUM ROLL)

12:21.450 --> 12:24.453
A one-on-one with Lord Hater!

12:24.536 --> 12:25.871
(LAUGHS)

12:26.914 --> 12:27.915
That's right.

12:27.998 --> 12:31.043
I put in a formal request
to interview our esteemed leader and...

12:31.126 --> 12:32.544
-(ALARM GOES OFF)
-Oh, my gracious!

12:32.628 --> 12:34.296
Maybe that's Hater now. Okay.

12:35.839 --> 12:38.884
Hello, you're live
on Eye On the Skull Ship with Andy,

12:38.967 --> 12:40.260
chief security monitor...

12:40.344 --> 12:41.720
I know who you are, Andy!

12:41.970 --> 12:43.305
This is Commander Peepers.

12:43.388 --> 12:46.433
Once again, your request to interview
Lord Hater has been rejected

12:46.517 --> 12:49.436
on grounds that it's not your job
to make this stupid show!

12:49.520 --> 12:52.064
Well, (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
it's not my job, per se.

12:52.147 --> 12:54.316
But you know, I think it's my duty
to help enlighten...

12:54.399 --> 12:56.902
-Just keep an eye on your sector.
-Yes, sir! Always do.

12:56.985 --> 12:58.445
No, you don't!

13:00.822 --> 13:02.282
Well, slight change of plans.

13:02.366 --> 13:05.118
Looks like we won't be talking
to Lord Hater.

13:05.202 --> 13:06.578
But fret not, dear viewers.

13:06.662 --> 13:10.290
I know you're dying to see him,
and I won't give up until I give

13:10.374 --> 13:12.167
(CONFUSED) you...

13:12.251 --> 13:13.460
what you want!

13:13.627 --> 13:15.796
In the meantime, I bet you're wondering...

13:16.922 --> 13:19.216
(ANNOUNCING) What's for lunch?

13:19.633 --> 13:24.096
(SIGHS) That's right. It's the 453rd time
we find out exactly

13:24.221 --> 13:27.850
what the Watchdogs are eating for lunch.

13:27.933 --> 13:29.351
Excuse me, fellow Watchdog.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.353
What refreshing and replenishing meal

13:31.436 --> 13:34.147
has been graciously given to you
by our generous leader

13:34.231 --> 13:35.357
Lord Hater?

13:37.276 --> 13:39.278
Oh, wow. Uh, hi.

13:39.361 --> 13:42.739
Um, apparently, I have never been on
live television before,

13:42.823 --> 13:45.325
and apparently, I'm having enchiladas.

13:45.617 --> 13:46.785
Apparently.

13:47.578 --> 13:48.579
Fascinating!

13:48.662 --> 13:50.998
-And what delicious...
-(SCREAMING) Enchiladas!

13:51.081 --> 13:53.041
(LOUD CHEERING)

13:54.293 --> 13:55.460
WATCHDOG: Enchiladas!

13:55.544 --> 13:57.462
Chef, tell us, enchiladas.

13:57.546 --> 14:00.382
Was this meal specifically chosen
by Lord Hater's decree?

14:01.508 --> 14:03.051
Uh... no.

14:03.135 --> 14:05.470
Taco Tuesday was yesterday,

14:05.554 --> 14:07.306
so there was leftovers,

14:07.389 --> 14:10.017
and I decided to make, uh,

14:10.100 --> 14:11.143
enchiladas.

14:11.226 --> 14:12.436
Hmm, interesting.

14:13.145 --> 14:15.480
So does Lord Hater like enchiladas?

14:15.772 --> 14:17.274
I don't know.

14:17.357 --> 14:20.194
All I know is,
I didn't want the stuff to go to waste,

14:20.277 --> 14:22.362
so I reused it today.

14:22.446 --> 14:24.239
Hm, yes. But Lord Hater see...

14:24.323 --> 14:25.365
The thing with...

14:26.700 --> 14:28.202
The thing with ground beef is,

14:28.285 --> 14:29.286
you gotta...

14:31.121 --> 14:32.164
Self-defense,

14:32.247 --> 14:35.792
where the Watchdogs closest to Hater,
his elite ground troops,

14:35.876 --> 14:38.295
learn the fine art of conquering.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.379
And if we're lucky,

14:39.505 --> 14:42.591
Lord Hater might make a surprise pop-in
to inspect the troops.

14:43.509 --> 14:46.845
To be the best takes months of
intense training in areas like

14:46.929 --> 14:48.639
Advanced Sylvia Defense,

14:53.852 --> 14:57.022
and, of course, Wander Avoidance Tactics.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.233
TRAINER: I know he wants to be
your friend.

14:59.316 --> 15:01.568
I know he wants to play carnival games.

15:01.652 --> 15:04.029
I know he knows all your names,

15:04.112 --> 15:05.656
and birthdays,

15:05.739 --> 15:09.743
and how you like to spend a rainy Sunday
with a crossword and a cup of chamomile.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.912
I mean, he is really not such a bad guy.

15:13.747 --> 15:14.873
No!

15:14.957 --> 15:17.334
Wander is pure, unadulterated love!

15:17.417 --> 15:21.129
I'm sure our resident drill instructor
has a host of exciting Hater stories

15:21.213 --> 15:22.214
to share with us.

Only Watchdogs in Hater's inner circle
are allowed on this level.

15:40.023 --> 15:42.901
I hope to speak with someone
close to the big man himself.

15:43.026 --> 15:44.736
Though it's risky, it's worth it,

15:44.820 --> 15:47.698

every Watchdog is waiting for.

with Commander Peepers,

has decided to do the show entirely
from the safety of his security office,

so he won't

17:39.601 --> 17:40.686
