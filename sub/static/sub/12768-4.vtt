I THINK WE SHOULD

ABOUT BUYING OUT HER SHARES?
YEAH.

AW.

WELCOME BACK.

02:11.417 --> 02:13.375

OKAY, IT FEELS LIKE
YOU DON'T LOOK AT ME.

02:29.125 --> 02:31.709
I THINK IF YOU COULD
WORK ON SAYING IT--

02:31.750 --> 02:34.041
I DON'T WANT TO KEEP
BRINGING IT UP.

02:34.083 --> 02:36.709
COLLETTE, SHE'S--
YOU THINK
IF YOU DON'T BRING IT UP,

02:36.750 --> 02:38.083
I'M GONNA FORGET
IT HAPPENED?

02:38.125 --> 02:40.125
THAT'S THE THING, TY.
IT'S THERE. IT HAPPENED.

02:40.166 --> 02:43.125
AND IF YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO DEAL
WITH WHAT COLLETTE WENT THROUGH,

02:43.166 --> 02:47.959
THEN YOU AND SHE AREN'T GONNA BE
ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.166
OKAY.

02:49.208 --> 02:52.542
WELL...
I'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

02:54.083 --> 02:56.333
UH, TY. MEET ME
BY THE ELEVATORS.

02:56.375 --> 02:58.542
I HAVE TO STOP BY
THE LADIES ROOM.

02:58.583 --> 03:00.834
SURE.

03:02.792 --> 03:04.625
I, UM...

03:04.667 --> 03:06.625
I-I TOOK
A HOME PREGNANCY TEST.

03:06.667 --> 03:09.041
YOU'RE PREGNANT? THAT'S...

03:09.083 --> 03:11.959
YOU GUYS HAVE WANTED THAT
FOR SO LONG.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.041
YOU'RE HAVING FEELINGS
ABOUT TELLING TY?

03:14.083 --> 03:16.166
NO, IT'S JUST, UM...

03:16.208 --> 03:18.000
I'M EIGHT WEEKS.

03:18.041 --> 03:19.583
DR. TURNER...

03:19.625 --> 03:22.792
I DON'T KNOW
WHO I'M PREGNANT BY...

03:22.834 --> 03:25.041
MY HUSBAND...

03:25.083 --> 03:27.000
OR THE MAN WHO RAPED ME.

03:34.083 --> 03:37.041
(Pete) SHE DIDN'T EVEN
LOOK AT HIM.
(Sam) NOTHING?

03:37.083 --> 03:39.000
SHE LOOKED THROUGH HIM.
SHE'S HAVING A HARD TIME.

03:39.041 --> 03:40.542
SHE'S GONNA COME AROUND.

03:40.583 --> 03:43.917
SO I HAVE A PATIENT WHO
DOESN'T KNOW IF SHE'S PREGNANT

03:43.959 --> 03:46.583
BY HER HUSBAND
OR THE MAN WHO RAPED HER.

03:46.625 --> 03:47.917
OOF.

03:47.959 --> 03:50.291
SINCE WHEN DID YOU START
WEARING TIES TO WORK?

03:50.333 --> 03:51.917
WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

03:51.959 --> 03:53.500
NO OCCASION. I WEAR TIES.

03:53.542 --> 03:56.000
OCCASION. IT'S VOLUNTEER
CLINIC DAY AT THE SHELTER.

03:56.041 --> 03:58.208
AND I'VE RECRUITED COOP AND SAM
TO COME DOWN THERE WITH ME.

03:58.250 --> 04:00.417
SO YOU DIDN'T NEED ME?

04:00.458 --> 04:03.792
OH, NO, NO, NO.
I-I JUST FIGURED THAT--

04:03.834 --> 04:06.250
I'M SEEING PATIENTS, ADDISON.
I AM FINE.

04:06.291 --> 04:09.917
SO, UH, LISTEN, BY THE WAY,
SINCE WE'RE ALL HERE.

04:09.959 --> 04:11.917
THERE IS SOMETHING
WE NEED TO DISCUSS.

04:11.959 --> 04:14.709
SINCE WE DECIDED
NOT TO REPLACE NAOMI,

04:14.750 --> 04:17.041
UH, WE NEED TO BUY OUT
HER SHARES.

04:17.083 --> 04:18.959
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO?

04:19.000 --> 04:22.125
WE EACH NEED TO PUT IN
$50,000 TO THE PRACTICE,

04:22.166 --> 04:26.250
AND THEN WE'LL BE
EQUAL PARTNERS.
50 GRAND?

04:26.291 --> 04:28.041
CHECK OKAY?
(Addison) CHECK IS PERFECT.

04:28.083 --> 04:31.458
I COULD DO MINE.
GOOD. GREAT.
OH, COME ON, GUYS.

04:31.500 --> 04:34.625
IT'S AN INVESTMENT
IN OUR FUTURE.
SURE, WHATEVER YOU NEED.

04:34.667 --> 04:38.709
IT'S FINE.
ALL RIGHT, SO IF WE CAN JUST GET
CHECKS BY THE END OF THE DAY,

04:38.750 --> 04:41.041
I'LL GET
ALL THE PAPERWORK ROLLING.

04:41.083 --> 04:43.667
OKAY. I WILL WRITE MINE...
RIGHT NOW.

04:53.083 --> 04:57.041
(child crying)

04:57.083 --> 04:59.291
(speaks inaudibly)

04:59.333 --> 05:02.041
OKEYDOKE,
WE HAVE, UH, TAMPONS,

05:02.083 --> 05:05.125
CONDOMS AND A SAMPLE
OF BIRTH CONTROL PILLS, SO--

05:05.166 --> 05:08.583
WE HITCHED HERE ABOUT
A MONTH AGO FROM PORTLAND. NO.

05:08.625 --> 05:11.041
I TRIED OUT SEATTLE
AND TACOMA,

05:11.083 --> 05:13.083
BUT I REALIZED,
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE HOMELESS,

05:13.125 --> 05:15.041
YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE WARM.
HEY.

05:15.083 --> 05:17.041
YOU KNOW, IT WOULD BE GREAT

05:17.083 --> 05:19.959
IF, UH, YOU AND ELLIOT
COULD GET CHECKUPS MORE OFTEN.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.083
THERE IS MEDI-CAL.
YEAH, YOU--YOU NEED
DOCUMENTS AND I.D.

05:23.125 --> 05:26.291
WELL, I COULD HELP YOU
TRACK DOWN YOUR DOCUMENTS.

05:26.333 --> 05:29.041
YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S OKAY.
WE'LL MAKE IT.

05:29.083 --> 05:31.041
DANIELLE, UM,
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

05:31.083 --> 05:34.083
15.
AND THERE'S NO ONE,
NO FAMILY?

05:34.125 --> 05:35.917
WELL, I-I GOT A MOM.

05:35.959 --> 05:38.041
SHE'S OUT OF THE PICTURE.

05:38.083 --> 05:41.041
IF I WANTED TO KEEP MY BABY,
I HAD TO LEAVE.

05:41.083 --> 05:44.583
BUT WE'RE GOOD. YOU KNOW,
I TAKE CARE OF US.

05:44.625 --> 05:47.166
IT'S BEEN HARD...
BUT WE'RE LUCKY.

05:47.208 --> 05:50.375
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE EACH OTHER.

05:50.417 --> 05:52.000
WELL, SOMETIMES...
LOOK, MOM.

05:52.041 --> 05:54.000
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS,
HUH?

05:54.041 --> 05:56.959
HUH?
HE'S HAD A RUNNY NOSE
FOR WEEKS.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.542
(sneezes)
I MEAN,
I GAVE HIM COLD MEDICINE.

05:59.583 --> 06:01.834
IT JUST WON'T GO AWAY.
WELL, HE'S GOT
A LITTLE FEVER.

06:01.875 --> 06:04.041
LET ME JUST HAVE
OUR PEDIATRICIAN TAKE A LOOK.

06:04.083 --> 06:06.333
OKAY.
OKAY? COOP.

06:06.375 --> 06:08.625
OH.

06:08.667 --> 06:10.625
HI.
DANIELLE, THIS IS,
UH, COO--DR. FREEDMAN.

06:10.667 --> 06:12.625
HI.
AND THIS IS ELLIOT. HE'S 2.

06:12.667 --> 06:15.792
HE'S GOT A LITTLE RUNNY NOSE
AND IT FEELS LIKE A FEVER.
CAN I TAKE A LOOK AT YOU?

06:15.834 --> 06:18.041
COME ON NOW.

06:18.083 --> 06:22.041
HEY, WHEN WE GET DONE,
YOU WANT TO GO TO THE PARK?

06:22.083 --> 06:24.417
(whispers) LET ME SEE HERE.

06:27.083 --> 06:30.000
HOW LONG HAS HE HAD THIS?
OH, THE RASH?

06:30.041 --> 06:32.375
YEAH.
UM, A FEW DAYS, MAYBE.

06:32.417 --> 06:34.625
IT'S NOT SOMETHING SERIOUS,
IS IT?

06:34.667 --> 06:36.625
UM, WE SHOULD--
WE SHOULD PROBABLY

06:36.667 --> 06:40.583
GET HIM BACK TO THE PRACTICE,
DO AN E.K.G. NOW.

06:40.625 --> 06:43.208
I WAS SO SURE
IT WAS TIME.

06:43.250 --> 06:47.000
IT WILL BE. YOU JUST--
YOU JUST HAVE TO WAIT.

06:48.417 --> 06:50.000
HEY, UH...

06:50.041 --> 06:51.375
YOUR FIRST PATIENT BACK?

06:51.417 --> 06:53.041
YEAH. UH, FALSE ALARM,
THOUGH.

06:53.083 --> 06:55.625
OH, HEY, I-I HEARD
ABOUT LUCAS, THAT HE'S YOURS.

06:55.667 --> 06:57.041
CONGRATULATIONS.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.041
HEY, DELL.
DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?

06:59.083 --> 07:01.667
I NEED TO GET
A-A C.V.S. TEST DONE.

07:01.709 --> 07:03.834
YEAH, SURE.

07:06.083 --> 07:08.750
(Sam) THERE. SEE?

07:08.792 --> 07:12.041
TINY ANEURYSMS
ON HIS CORONARY ARTERIES.

07:12.083 --> 07:14.041
BLOOD VESSELS TO HIS HEART
ARE INFLAMED.

07:14.083 --> 07:17.125
SO IT'S KAWASAKI SYNDROME. IT
EXPLAINS THE ERYTHEMATOUS RASH.

07:17.166 --> 07:19.667
SO THIS KID'S HOMELESS
WITH A HEART CONDITION.

07:19.709 --> 07:22.291
SO WE TREAT IT
WITH IMMUNOGLOBULINS.
IT COULD HELP, BUT IT'S NOT
A DEFINITIVE REPAIR.

07:22.333 --> 07:25.041
YEAH, BUT IT'S THE FIRST LINE
OF TREATMENT, RIGHT?

07:25.083 --> 07:28.917
WHAT?
I MEAN, HIS MOTHER CAN'T EVEN
AFFORD A PLACE TO LIVE,

07:28.959 --> 07:31.875
AND NOW SHE'S GONNA HAVE A SON
THAT COULD CONTINUE TO GET SICK.

07:31.917 --> 07:34.667
I-I--I'M WORRIED.
I-I WOULD LIKE TO DO MORE.
LIKE WHAT?

07:34.709 --> 07:37.542
I COULD FIX IT--
A BYPASS PROCEDURE.

07:37.583 --> 07:39.709
SAM, I KNOW
YOU JUST DID SURGERY--

07:39.750 --> 07:42.083
WELL, HEY, WAIT, IT WAS
AN AMAZING SURGERY.

07:42.125 --> 07:44.166
YES,
BUT THERE'S A PROCESS.

07:44.208 --> 07:46.375
YOU CAN'T JUST JUMP BACK
INTO SURGERY OVERNIGHT.

07:46.417 --> 07:48.500
THE BOY HAS A HEART PROBLEM,

07:48.542 --> 07:52.250
A HEART PROBLEM THAT YOU AND I
BOTH KNOW NOBODY ELSE WILL TOUCH

07:52.291 --> 07:55.250
BECAUSE THERE'S NO MONEY IN IT.
SAM, YOU'RE JUMPING THE GUN
ON THIS.

07:55.291 --> 07:57.875
MAYBE I AM,
BUT... I MEAN, I LOOK AT HER,

07:57.917 --> 08:00.959
AND SHE SHOULD BE IN SCHOOL
WITH MAYA, AND SHE'S NOT.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.041
SHE'S NOT. SHE'S ALONE,
AND IT'S WRONG.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.291
CAN WE RUN HER SOCIAL,
GET AN ADDRESS,

08:05.333 --> 08:07.250
TRY TO CALL THE MOTHER?

08:07.291 --> 08:09.291
WE DON'T KNOW THE SITUATION.
SHE MAY BE A RUNAWAY.

08:09.333 --> 08:11.041
BUT SHE COULD'VE BEEN
ABUSED OR MOLESTED.

08:11.083 --> 08:13.709
OKAY, WE ARE NOT GOING TO
PUT HER IN DANGER,

08:13.750 --> 08:16.500
BUT SHE IS A KID ON THE STREET,
IN OVER HER HEAD

08:16.542 --> 08:19.041
WITH A SICK BABY.
WELL, NOT EVERYONE'S RICH
WITH A PERFECT LIFE.

08:19.083 --> 08:22.417
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
I DON'T--IT JUST MEANS
WE... I DON'T KNOW.

08:22.458 --> 08:24.625
LET'S FIND THE MOM.

08:24.667 --> 08:27.000
YOU GUYS...

08:29.000 --> 08:30.500
(crying)

08:30.542 --> 08:34.041
WHAT? WHY ARE WE HERE?
DID SOMETHING--

08:34.083 --> 08:38.625
I'M... PREGNANT, TY.

08:38.667 --> 08:40.834
AND, UM, THERE'S--
YOU'RE PREGNANT?

08:40.875 --> 08:43.667
SO I'M GONNA BE
A FATHER?

08:43.709 --> 08:46.583
TH-THIS IS GREAT. THIS--
THIS IS WHAT WE WANTED.

08:46.625 --> 08:48.959
I KNOW IT'S BEEN AWFUL.
I'VE BEEN AWFUL.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.792
BUT IT'S LIKE
A NEW START, BABY.

08:52.834 --> 08:55.041
WE RAN A PATERNITY TEST.

08:55.083 --> 08:58.166
IT TURNS OUT THAT
YOU'RE NOT THE...

08:58.208 --> 09:00.041
NO.

09:00.083 --> 09:03.125
NO! IT'S HIS?

09:03.166 --> 09:05.542
TY, I-I KNOW THIS IS AWFUL.

09:05.583 --> 09:07.792
HOW SOON CAN WE ABORT?

09:07.834 --> 09:10.000
MM.

09:11.458 --> 09:13.750
NOW SHE'S NOT LOOKING AT ME.
NOW SHE'S NOT TALKING.

09:13.792 --> 09:15.208
COLLETTE,
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

09:15.250 --> 09:17.875
IT--IT--IT'S AWFUL.
I KNOW IT IS.

09:17.917 --> 09:21.625
BUT--BUT--BUT WE'VE BEEN TRYING
FOR SO LONG TO HAVE A BABY.

09:21.667 --> 09:24.417
AND--AND THIS ISN'T HOW
I IMAGINED IT COULD HAPPEN,

09:24.458 --> 09:26.917
BUT THIS COULD BE OUR CHANCE.
OUR CHANCE?

09:26.959 --> 09:30.083
YEAH, BABE...

09:30.125 --> 09:32.583
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT
HAVING HIM?

09:32.625 --> 09:34.834
AFTER THAT PIG DID--

09:34.875 --> 09:37.583
YOU R--AFTER HE RAPED YOU?

09:37.625 --> 09:39.917
LOOK, THERE, I SAID IT.
HE RAPED YOU!

09:39.959 --> 09:43.667
AND YOU WANT HIM INSIDE YOU
FOR ANOTHER NINE MONTHS?

09:45.417 --> 09:47.166
NO.

10:02.667 --> 10:05.417
VIOLET?

10:05.458 --> 10:09.041
OH, HEY.
NAOMI ASKED ME TO COME
DOWNSTAIRS FOR A CONSULT.

10:09.083 --> 10:11.291
DO YOU MIND WATCHING LUCAS?

10:11.333 --> 10:12.917
UH, I'M SORRY.

10:12.959 --> 10:14.917
I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF A SITUATION.

10:14.959 --> 10:16.917
THAT HUSBAND JUST FOUND OUT

10:16.959 --> 10:18.917
HIS WIFE IS PREGNANT
BY HER RAPIST.

10:18.959 --> 10:21.417
SO I'M--I'M WAY BEHIND
IN PATIENT NOTES.
YOU HAVE TIME.

10:21.458 --> 10:23.458
LUCAS WILL NOT BE INSULTED

10:23.500 --> 10:26.417
IF YOU DO A LITTLE WORK
WHILE HE'S VISITING.

10:35.083 --> 10:37.583
(elevator bell dings)

10:37.625 --> 10:39.583
NAOMI, IF VIOLET ASKS,

10:39.625 --> 10:41.583
I'M HERE TO CONSULT
ON A CASE FOR YOU.

10:41.625 --> 10:43.583
WHAT AM I AN EXCUSE FOR?

10:43.625 --> 10:45.583
SO I CAN LEAVE
THE BABY WITH HER.

10:45.625 --> 10:47.583
COME ON.
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

10:47.625 --> 10:50.000
I FIGURED IF I BROUGHT
LUCAS TO WORK,

10:50.041 --> 10:53.000
SHE'D BE FORCED TO SEE HIM,
AND MAYBE--
UH, I DON'T KNOW THAT FORCING
HER TO BOND WITH THE BABY

10:53.041 --> 10:56.000
IS GONNA BE
SUCH A GOOD IDEA.
LOOK, I DON'T EXPECT
A MIRACLE,

10:56.041 --> 10:58.083
BUT MAYBE IF SHE JUST
GOT CURIOUS,

10:58.125 --> 11:01.291
SOMETHING TO REMIND HER
THAT SHE HAS A SON WITH ME.

11:01.333 --> 11:04.041
AM I CRAZY?

11:04.083 --> 11:05.709
(sighs)

11:05.750 --> 11:09.000
TRUST ME. CHOCOLATE CURES
ALMOST EVERYTHING.

11:11.959 --> 11:13.917
THIS PLACE IS NICE.
YOU'VE DONE WELL.

11:13.959 --> 11:16.709
YEAH, YEAH, IT'S NICE.
IT'S A LITTLE QUIET.

11:16.750 --> 11:19.083
(mouth full)
WELL, QUIET'S GOOD.
NO, NO, YEAH, QUIET IS FINE.

11:19.125 --> 11:20.709
QUIET IS PROFESSIONAL.

11:20.750 --> 11:23.041
BUT IT'S... I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.792
EVERYONE'S ALWAYS HOLED UP
IN THEIR OFFICES WORKING,

11:25.834 --> 11:27.792
AND I JUST KINDA...
I FEEL LIKE...

11:27.834 --> 11:30.458
THEY TREAT ME LIKE--
(normal voice) THE BOSS?

11:30.500 --> 11:32.417
EXACTLY.

11:32.458 --> 11:34.041
YOU'RE ON MY TURF.

11:34.083 --> 11:35.834
YOU HAVE TURF?

11:35.875 --> 11:38.834
WORK IS TURF. YOU'VE GOT VIOLET.
YOU'VE GOT LUCAS.

11:38.875 --> 11:41.125
I'M OUT OF THE PICTURE,
AND I'M DEALING WITH IT.

11:41.166 --> 11:43.125
BUT YOU BEING HERE
AT MY WORK?

11:43.166 --> 11:45.458
THAT IS NOT PART OF
MY PROGRAM.

11:45.500 --> 11:48.417
SO I WILL ASK YOU
TO LEAVE, PLEASE.
SHELDON.

11:48.458 --> 11:51.750
(chuckles) UH, IT--IT'S OKAY.
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

11:51.792 --> 11:54.000
TURF?

11:57.583 --> 12:01.041
I'M FINE. JUST WORKING MY WAY
THROUGH THE GRIEVING PROCESS.

12:01.083 --> 12:03.041
DENIAL NEVER LASTS
VERY LONG WITH ME.

12:03.083 --> 12:05.792
THE ANGER DOES,
BUT I'M PAST IT.

12:05.834 --> 12:08.375
AND FRANKLY, I'M TOO BUSY
WITH WORK TO BE DEPRESSED,

12:08.417 --> 12:10.375
AND AS FAR
AS ACCEPTANCE GOES...

12:10.417 --> 12:12.375
WELL, SCREW ACCEPTANCE.
(chuckles)

12:12.417 --> 12:16.000
BUT REALLY,
I FEEL, UM... FINE.

12:16.041 --> 12:18.792
YOU WANT TO EAT
SOME CHOCOLATE WITH ME?

12:18.834 --> 12:20.000
YEAH.

12:30.917 --> 12:34.000
(mouth full) DO YOU ALWAYS
STUFF YOUR FEELINGS WITH FOOD?

12:34.041 --> 12:35.458
YES.

12:35.500 --> 12:38.041
INTERESTING.

12:38.083 --> 12:39.500
(footsteps approach)

12:39.542 --> 12:42.417
(knock on door)
I FOUND THE MOTHER--
DANIELLE'S MOTHER.

12:42.458 --> 12:45.625
THAT'S... GREAT.
I HAVE GOT SAM
AND VIOLET'S CHECK.

12:45.667 --> 12:49.041
I CAN GET YOURS, TOO,
AND GET IT IN THE ACCOUNT.
RIGHT NOW?

12:49.083 --> 12:51.417
IT'S FOR THE PRACTICE,
FOR OUR PRACTICE.

12:51.458 --> 12:54.834
I NEED TO GET THE CHECKS BY--
BY THE END OF THE DAY.

12:54.875 --> 12:58.417
RIGHT. OH. DO YOU NEED
UNTIL LATER IN THE WEEK?
(laughs)

12:58.458 --> 13:02.125
A LITTLE LATER IN THE WEEK?
A LITTLE LATER IN THE WEEK.

13:02.166 --> 13:04.750
WHAT? WHAT, COOPER?

13:04.792 --> 13:07.041
NOT EVERYONE HAS
A $30-MILLION TRUST FUND.

13:07.083 --> 13:08.125
OH.

13:08.166 --> 13:09.875
OH.

13:09.917 --> 13:11.291
OKAY, I--OKAY--

13:11.333 --> 13:14.000
NO, NO, NO, IT...
FORGET IT.

13:16.083 --> 13:17.583
(sighs)

13:20.417 --> 13:23.125
THAT'S A LOT OF TUBES.

13:23.166 --> 13:25.041
ARE THEY HURTING HIM?

13:25.083 --> 13:27.875
NO, NO, THE TUBES
AREN'T HURTING HIM.

13:27.917 --> 13:30.792
THAT'S HOW HE GETS
HIS MEDICINE.
HE'S NEVER STAYED
A NIGHT AWAY FROM ME.

13:30.834 --> 13:34.458
AND IF I'M NOT BACK
AT THE SHELTER BY 8:00--
OKAY, YOU CAN STAY IN THERE
WITH HIM.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.375
WE'LL GET YOU ALL SET UP.
I'LL SPEAK TO THE NURSES.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.792
OKAY.
OKAY.

13:39.834 --> 13:41.250
(sighs)

13:41.291 --> 13:44.291
SO WE'LL, UH, WE'LL SEE
WHAT THE--WHAT THE MEDS DO.

13:44.333 --> 13:47.583
I REALLY THINK THAT SURGERY
WOULD BE A BETTER OPTION.

13:47.625 --> 13:50.792
NOT UNTIL THE MOM GETS HERE.
I CALLED HER--THE MOM.

13:50.834 --> 13:53.000
SHE IS ON HER WAY.
OKAY.

13:53.041 --> 13:55.000
AM I AN ASS...

13:55.041 --> 13:57.291
A CALLOUS, OBLIVIOUS ASS?

13:57.333 --> 13:59.417
WHAT EXACTLY
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE?
COOPER.

13:59.458 --> 14:03.041
COOPER CALLED YOU AN ASS?
HE YELLED AT ME ABOUT MONEY.

14:03.083 --> 14:05.959
(inhales sharply) OH, THAT.
WHAT? WHAT?

14:06.000 --> 14:08.834
NOTHING. IT'S JUST...
YOU'RE A RICH KID, ADDISON.

14:08.875 --> 14:11.333
YOU GREW UP WITH MONEY.
YOU NEVER HAD TO WORRY ABOUT IT.

14:11.375 --> 14:13.625
THE REST OF US,
IT'S NOT SO EASY.

14:13.667 --> 14:16.208
BUT WE'RE ALL DOCTORS.
I MEAN, YOU BACKED ME ON THIS.

14:16.250 --> 14:19.250
YEAH, BECAUSE IT'S WHAT
WE NEED TO DO FOR THE PRACTICE.

14:19.291 --> 14:22.250
AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS
THAT I COULD WRITE THE CHECK.

14:22.291 --> 14:24.875
(sighs) SO I AM AN ASS.

14:24.917 --> 14:27.333
YOU COULD BE
A LITTLE BIT MORE SENSITIVE.

14:27.375 --> 14:30.375
KIND OF LIKE, BECAUSE YOU'RE
THIS WORLD-CLASS SURGEON,

14:30.417 --> 14:33.375
YOU DON'T SEE HOW TELLING ME
I CAN'T OPERATE ON THIS KID

14:33.417 --> 14:36.041
MIGHT BE CUTTING MY LEGS
FROM UNDERNEATH ME.
I DIDN'T.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.917
WELL, YOU DID.

14:41.083 --> 14:43.458
(sighs)

14:43.500 --> 14:47.333
(banging)

14:47.375 --> 14:49.333
WH-WHAT--WHAT...

14:49.375 --> 14:52.041
WHAT... WHAT'S GOING ON
RIGHT NOW?

14:52.083 --> 14:55.000
FAUCET DRIP WAS GOING ON
ALL NIGHT.

14:55.041 --> 14:57.917
IT WAS DRIVING ME BONKERS.
AND SO YOU DECIDED
TO TEAR UP MY BATHROOM?

14:57.959 --> 15:00.041
NEW MARBLE COUNTERS, HARDWOOD
FLOORS, RECESSED LIGHTING.

15:00.083 --> 15:02.917
(laughs) OH, YOU SWEPT ME OFF
MY FEET AND DRAGGED ME HERE,

15:02.959 --> 15:05.291
BUT DON'T EXPECT ME TO LIVE
IN A MANHOLE.

15:05.333 --> 15:07.291
BULLDOZING MY BATHROOM
TO AVOID GOING TO WORK

15:07.333 --> 15:09.917
AND DEALING WITH YOUR PROBLEMS
IS NOT COOL.

15:09.959 --> 15:13.208
THIS IS SO NOT COOL.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME
SO EARLY, COOP,

15:13.250 --> 15:15.834
HANGDOG LOOK?

15:15.875 --> 15:17.834
GOOD. WE'RE TWO PEAS
IN A POD.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.875
NOW THERE'S
DRY ROT THAT'S A MESS.

15:19.917 --> 15:23.458
RECEIPTS ARE ON THE TABLE.
YOU CAN WRITE ME A CHECK.
FOR WHAT?

15:23.500 --> 15:25.500
TO PAY FOR ALL THIS.

15:25.542 --> 15:28.834
DAMN IT, CHARLOTTE. YOU REALLY
SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THIS.

15:28.875 --> 15:30.917
(plastic crinkles)

15:30.959 --> 15:33.041
AH. OH.

15:33.083 --> 15:35.625
NO CONTRACTIONS,
JUST LIKE THIS MORNING.

15:35.667 --> 15:37.667
UH... BUT I FEEL IT.

15:37.709 --> 15:41.041
NO, NO, NO. IT'S ALL
RIGHT HERE, AND SHE'S DUE.

15:41.083 --> 15:43.125
MY DAUGHTER?
A WEEK OVERDUE.

15:43.166 --> 15:45.333
AND I'M ABOUT TO
PICK HER UP FROM SCHOOL.

15:45.375 --> 15:48.834
IT'LL HAPPEN
WHEN IT'S SUPPOSED TO, OKAY?
BUT WHAT IF SOMETHING BAD
HAPPENS WHEN I GET HOME,

15:48.875 --> 15:50.834
LIKE SHE ENDS UP BREECHED

15:50.875 --> 15:53.834
OR I HAVE HER IN THE TUB
AND SHE DROWNS?
KIMMIE, YOUR BABY
WILL BE FINE.

15:53.875 --> 15:56.250
HOW CAN YOU BE SURE?
MY HUSBAND'S NOT AROUND.

15:56.291 --> 15:59.458
I HAVE TONS OF QUESTIONS
I NEED ANSWERED.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.542
HEY, LOOK! I PAID
FOR THE MIDWIFE EXPERIENCE,

16:02.583 --> 16:04.667
AND YOU HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND.

16:04.709 --> 16:08.583
OKAY, OKAY. LET'S, UH, LET'S
GO OVER SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS.

16:08.625 --> 16:10.709
(exhales deeply)

16:19.709 --> 16:23.041
(sighs) YOU JUST LEFT LUCAS
SITTING THERE?

16:23.083 --> 16:25.125
HE HASN'T CRIED.
BUT HE'S AWAKE, VIOLET.

16:25.166 --> 16:28.041
DIDN'T YOU WANT TO PICK HIM UP
AND PLAY WITH HIM?

16:28.083 --> 16:30.667
NO, I'M WORKING, PETE.
I'M AT WORK, WORKING.

16:30.709 --> 16:32.834
(Lucas fussing)

16:32.875 --> 16:35.083
YOU'RE HIS MOTHER.

16:35.125 --> 16:38.000
SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.
SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.

16:44.959 --> 16:45.959
(clears throat)

16:58.792 --> 17:00.834
(knock on door)

17:00.875 --> 17:02.166
VIOLET.

17:02.208 --> 17:05.250
CHARLOTTE IS TAKING OUT
HER PROBLEMS ON MY BATHROOM.

17:05.291 --> 17:07.250
SHE NEEDS TO BE STOPPED.

17:07.291 --> 17:09.250
SO I NEED TO
HIDE THIS HERE BEFORE...

17:09.291 --> 17:12.000
I JUST CAN'T LET HER DESTROY
ANYTHING ELSE.

17:15.208 --> 17:17.166
WHY ARE WE STARING
AT THE FLOOR?

17:17.208 --> 17:20.041
I'VE BEEN TRYING FOR WEEKS TO
GET THE BLOOD OUT OF THE WOOD,

17:20.083 --> 17:22.041
AND NOTHING WORKS.

17:22.083 --> 17:25.834
I'VE TRIED EVERY BRAND.
THAT'S MY FIFTH BOTTLE.

17:25.875 --> 17:27.166
(pounding)

17:27.208 --> 17:29.542
SO... IF CHARLOTTE WAS RAPED

17:29.583 --> 17:31.542
AND ENDED UP GETTING PREGNANT
BY HER RAPIST

17:31.583 --> 17:33.542
AND DECIDED TO KEEP THE BABY,

17:33.583 --> 17:35.834
THAT WOULD BE A DEAL BREAKER
FOR YOU, RIGHT?

17:35.875 --> 17:38.792
DO NOT HYPOTHETICALLY
RAPE MY GIRLFRIEND. I DON'T--
THE COUPLE--
THE WOMAN THAT WAS RAPED--

17:38.834 --> 17:40.792
SHE WANTS TO KEEP HER--
THE RAPIST'S BABY.

17:40.834 --> 17:43.375
SHE WANTS TO KEEP THE BABY?
YEAH. THAT'S JUST CRAZY,
RIGHT?

17:43.417 --> 17:45.375
I THINK I'M GONNA TELL HER
IT'S CRAZY.

17:45.417 --> 17:47.792
I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S NOT MY JOB
TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR PEOPLE,

17:47.834 --> 17:49.667
BUT--YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT FAIR.

17:49.709 --> 17:52.208
PEDIATRICIANS--
YOU GET TO DIAGNOSE,

17:52.250 --> 17:54.417
YOU GET TO TELL PEOPLE
WHAT TO DO.

17:54.458 --> 17:57.625
I'M SUPPOSED TO JUST SIT BACK
AND LET PEOPLE FIGURE IT OUT.
HELP THEM
FIGURE IT OUT. RIGHT.

17:57.667 --> 17:59.834
I MEAN, THE POINT IS,
IT'S WRONG, RIGHT?

17:59.875 --> 18:02.000
RIGHT. I THINK.

18:06.208 --> 18:09.041
HEY, DID YOU ACTUALLY
WRITE ADDISON A CHECK?

18:18.083 --> 18:19.709
VIOLET.

18:19.750 --> 18:23.333
DO YOU THINK IT'S WORKING?

18:23.375 --> 18:26.250
YEAH, MAYBE A LITTLE.

18:26.291 --> 18:29.417
(Naomi) HOW COULD SHE LOOK
AT THIS FACE

18:29.458 --> 18:31.041
AND NOT MELT?

18:31.083 --> 18:33.834
SHE'S NOT LOOKING.
I'M--I'M OUT OF IDEAS.

18:33.875 --> 18:36.041
WAS I NOT CLEAR?

18:36.083 --> 18:38.500
SHELDON--
I REALIZE YOU'RE NOT
A TRAINED THERAPIST, PETE,

18:38.542 --> 18:40.959
BUT I WOULD THINK THAT
A DOCTOR SUCH AS YOURSELF

18:41.000 --> 18:43.709
WOULD UNDERSTAND BOUNDARIES.
UH, SHELDON.

18:43.750 --> 18:46.125
NO, NAOMI, PLEASE. THIS IS
MY BATTLE, NOT YOURS.

18:46.166 --> 18:50.375
WE'RE NOT BATTLING, SHELDON.
NAOMI'S MY FRIEND--
NO, NO, NO. MY FRIEND.
I CALL NAOMI.

18:50.417 --> 18:53.542
WHAT?
NO, HE GETS THE GIRL.
HE GETS THE BABY. I GET YOU.

18:53.583 --> 18:56.041
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.
NOW GET OFF OUR FLOOR.

18:56.083 --> 18:58.458
PETE, I'LL--I'LL JUST--
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

18:58.500 --> 19:00.583
GO AHEAD AND GO, OKAY?
YEAH, BUT SH--

19:00.625 --> 19:02.917
JUST GO.

19:02.959 --> 19:07.083
FOR THE RECORD, I MAY NOT BE
FULLY OVER THE ANGER PART.

19:07.125 --> 19:09.875
MAYBE NOT.

19:09.917 --> 19:12.458
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

19:12.500 --> 19:16.041
(woman) DANIELLE.

19:16.083 --> 19:18.291
(crying) DANIELLE.

19:18.333 --> 19:20.291
WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

19:20.333 --> 19:22.333
YOU LOOK SO THIN.

19:22.375 --> 19:25.041
I'M FINE, MOM.
WAIT. WHO CALLED HER?

19:25.083 --> 19:27.083
WHO CALLED HER?

19:27.125 --> 19:29.417
WHO--
DANIELLE, I CALLED.

19:29.458 --> 19:32.083
I LOOKED AND I LOOKED FOR YOU,
BUT YOU WERE JUST GONE.

19:32.125 --> 19:34.041
OH, HE'S BEAUTIFUL.

19:34.083 --> 19:36.417
HE LOOKS LIKE YOU
WHEN YOU WERE A BABY.

19:36.458 --> 19:39.041
DON'T TOUCH HIM.

19:39.083 --> 19:41.500
DANIELLE, YOU CAN
COME HOME NOW. I DON'T--

19:41.542 --> 19:43.917
YOU BROUGHT HER HERE?
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

19:43.959 --> 19:45.959
DANIELLE, DANIELLE, SHE--
SHE WAS TRYING TO HELP.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.041
HELP? SHE DRAGGED ME
TO AN ABORTION CLINIC.

19:48.083 --> 19:50.041
AND WHEN I WOULDN'T DO IT,

19:50.083 --> 19:53.166
SHE SAID I HAD TO
GIVE HIM UP FOR ADOPTION.

19:53.208 --> 19:56.041
I DON'T WANT HER HERE.
DANIELLE,
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

19:56.083 --> 19:58.041
FINE. FINE.
PLEASE--

19:58.083 --> 20:02.000
IF SHE WON'T LEAVE,
THEN I WILL.
JUST STAY. JUST STAY.

20:02.041 --> 20:04.417
(sobs)

20:07.083 --> 20:08.875
(Addison) YOU TOLD ME SO.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.875
LET'S JUST HOPE
WE FIND 'EM, OKAY?

20:10.917 --> 20:12.875
LOOK, I'M SORRY, COOP,
ABOUT THE MONEY.

20:12.917 --> 20:15.875
I MEAN, I WASN'T TRYING
TO BE AN ASS, YOU KNOW?

20:15.917 --> 20:19.000
AND IF--IF YOU'RE NOT LIQUID,
I COULD FRONT YOU THE MONEY.

20:19.041 --> 20:21.125
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM. WHAT?

20:21.166 --> 20:23.041
I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY.
BUT--

20:23.083 --> 20:25.500
AND I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

20:25.542 --> 20:29.041
(child screaming)

20:29.083 --> 20:30.625
SHH, BABY.

20:30.667 --> 20:33.166
DANIELLE!
(Addison) DANIELLE.

20:33.208 --> 20:36.083
HOW LONG'S HE BEEN LIKE THIS?
OVER AN HOUR. IT'S FINE.
HE'S JUST--HE'S HUNGRY, OKAY?

20:36.125 --> 20:38.083
HE ALWAYS CRIES LIKE THIS
WHEN HE'S HUNGRY.

20:38.125 --> 20:40.500
WE WERE JUST TOO LOUD INSIDE.

20:40.542 --> 20:42.625
I WAS SCARED
I WAS GONNA GET KICKED OUT.
(screams)

20:42.667 --> 20:44.500
COME ON.
BE A GOOD BOY, OKAY?

20:44.542 --> 20:46.709
I-I GOT SOME PUDDING
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

20:46.750 --> 20:49.166
I TOOK IT OFF THE TRAYS.
DO YOU THINK HE'LL TAKE THAT?
DANIELLE, DANIELLE,
LISTEN TO ME.

20:49.208 --> 20:51.041
IF THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH HIM,

20:51.083 --> 20:53.583
PUDDING IS NOT GOING TO HELP.
CAN YOU LET ME CHECK HIM?

20:53.625 --> 20:57.041
LET ME--LET ME JUST CHECK HIM,
JUST REAL QUICK.
OKAY?

20:57.083 --> 21:00.291
(fussing)
OKAY? IT'S OKAY.
SHH, SHH, SHH.

21:00.333 --> 21:02.542
OKAY.
THAT'S A GOOD BOY.

21:02.583 --> 21:04.041
(Elliot whimpers)
(Addison) SHH.

21:04.083 --> 21:06.250
(whispers) IT'S OKAY.

21:06.291 --> 21:08.625
(normal voice)
OKAY, CALL 9-1-1.
(cries)

21:08.667 --> 21:11.458
LAY HIM HERE. COME ON.
IT'S OKAY.

21:11.500 --> 21:14.458
YOU'RE OKAY.
JUST STAY WITH US, OKAY?
(cries)

21:16.875 --> 21:18.625
HE NEVER CAME HOME.

21:18.667 --> 21:21.041
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
SINCE HE LEFT HERE.

21:21.083 --> 21:23.041
WELL, HE'S WORKING
THROUGH THIS.

21:23.083 --> 21:25.041
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
WHY...

21:25.083 --> 21:27.041
WHY YOU WOULD CONSIDER THIS.

21:27.083 --> 21:28.709
I KNOW. I LOVE TY.

21:28.750 --> 21:31.417
WE WERE SUMMER CAMP COUNSELORS
TOGETHER.

21:31.458 --> 21:34.542
WE WERE PERFECT, BUT...

21:34.583 --> 21:36.041
BUT?

21:36.083 --> 21:38.834
BUT I'M HAVING A BABY.

21:41.125 --> 21:43.083
A-AND YOU REALLY THINK
THAT YOU'RE UP

21:43.125 --> 21:45.250
TO PUTTING YOURSELF
THROUGH THIS?

21:45.291 --> 21:48.041
WELL... YEAH.

21:48.083 --> 21:50.041
MAYBE.

21:50.083 --> 21:52.291
WHAT...
YOU DON'T THINK I AM?

21:52.333 --> 21:54.917
WELL, I KNOW YOU WANT
TO HAVE A CHILD,

21:54.959 --> 21:58.041
BUT DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT LIFE IS GONNA BE LIKE,

21:58.083 --> 22:00.041
SEEING THAT BABY EVERY DAY?

22:00.083 --> 22:03.875
EVERY TIME YOU SEE IT,
IT'S GONNA BE LIKE A RECORDING

22:03.917 --> 22:06.709
PLAYING OVER AND OVER
IN YOUR MIND.

22:06.750 --> 22:11.583
SO YOU'LL... REMEMBER
LYING THERE FEELING HELPLESS.

22:11.625 --> 22:14.041
YOU WILL REMEMBER HIM
STANDING OVER YOU

22:14.083 --> 22:16.208
AND TOUCHING YOU.

22:16.250 --> 22:20.291
YOU WILL REMEMBER...
SCREAMING YOUR LUNGS OUT,

22:20.333 --> 22:22.291
SCREAMING UNTIL YOU'RE HOARSE,

22:22.333 --> 22:24.083
HOPING AND PRAYING

22:24.125 --> 22:27.083
THAT SOMEBODY WILL COME
AND FIND YOU.

22:27.125 --> 22:29.709
BUT NOBODY IS COMING.

22:29.750 --> 22:33.083
AND THEN COMES
THE UNBEARABLE PAIN.

22:33.125 --> 22:36.709
AND THEN YOU FEEL YOURSELF
PASSING OUT,

22:36.750 --> 22:39.750
BUT BEFORE YOU DO, YOU WONDER
IF YOU'LL EVER WAKE UP AGAIN,

22:39.792 --> 22:41.750
AND PART OF YOU HOPES
THAT YOU NEVER WILL.

22:41.792 --> 22:43.750
(voice breaking)
SO ALL OF THAT...

22:43.792 --> 22:47.583
ALL OF THAT WILL BE
STARING AT YOU EVERY DAY.

22:47.625 --> 22:51.583
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT THAT?

22:55.458 --> 22:57.500
OH, MY GOD.

23:00.750 --> 23:03.000
OH, MY...

23:06.875 --> 23:09.333
OH, MY GOD.

23:09.375 --> 23:12.792
(voice breaks) OH, MY GOD.

23:12.834 --> 23:14.792
(normal voice) COLLETTE.

23:22.250 --> 23:25.375
ONE OF THE ANEURYSMS
MUST HAVE RUPTURED.
THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

23:25.417 --> 23:28.375
THAT MEDICINE THAT YOU GAVE ME,
YOU SAID IT WOULD WORK.
WE WANTED IT TO WORK.

23:28.417 --> 23:31.041
THE LAST THING WE WANTED TO DO,
DANIELLE, IS PUT YOU AND ELLIOT

23:31.083 --> 23:34.792
THROUGH ANYTHING MORE
THAN WE HAD TO.
BUT YOU--
YOU CAN FIX HIM, RIGHT?

23:34.834 --> 23:36.417
WELL, THERE ARE A FEW THINGS

23:36.458 --> 23:39.834
WE COULD DO FOR ELLIOT,
ONE OF WHICH IS BYPASS SURGERY.

23:39.875 --> 23:42.667
THAT'S WHERE WE TAKE A VEIN THAT
GOES AROUND THE DAMAGED VESSEL.

23:42.709 --> 23:45.041
OR WE COULD INSERT A STENT.
WHAT'S A STENT?

23:45.083 --> 23:47.458
THAT'S EXPERIMENTAL
IN KIDS HIS AGE.

23:47.500 --> 23:50.250
WE PUT A TINY TUBE IN THE VESSEL
TO KEEP IT OPEN.

23:50.291 --> 23:52.458
I MEAN, THEY--
THEY BOTH SOUND GOOD.

23:52.500 --> 23:55.458
I...
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

23:55.500 --> 23:58.834
WELL, UH, BYPASS SURGERY.

23:58.875 --> 24:02.000
IT'S THE RIGHT TREATMENT,
HE NEEDS IT, AND I'LL DO IT.

24:04.125 --> 24:06.291
I'LL DO THE SURGERY.
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

24:06.333 --> 24:07.917
I TRUST YOU. YOU...

24:07.959 --> 24:10.125
ALL RIGHT.
DO THE SURGERY.

24:10.166 --> 24:12.709
CAN I SEE ELLIOT?

24:12.750 --> 24:16.041
SURE.
SURE, YEAH.
I'LL TAKE YOU TO HIM.

24:16.083 --> 24:17.750
OKAY.

24:17.792 --> 24:21.291
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY,
BUT I COULDN'T STAND THERE

24:21.333 --> 24:23.458
AND WATCH THAT GIRL
BE SO CONFUSED.

24:23.500 --> 24:25.542
I CAN DO THIS SURGERY.

24:25.583 --> 24:27.917
IT'S YOUR CALL.

24:33.083 --> 24:35.083
TY.

24:35.125 --> 24:36.709
THANKS FOR SEEING ME.

24:36.750 --> 24:39.375
I JUST WANTED TO COME BY
AND SAY THANK YOU.

24:39.417 --> 24:40.917
FOR?

24:40.959 --> 24:42.917
FOR TALKING SENSE
INTO COLLETTE.

24:42.959 --> 24:44.959
SHE SCHEDULED AN ABORTION
FOR TOMORROW.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.750
FOR TOMORROW.
SHE'S SURE?

24:47.792 --> 24:49.291
SHE IS NOW.

24:49.333 --> 24:51.375
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU SAID TO HER--

24:51.417 --> 24:53.125
SHE WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME--

24:53.166 --> 24:54.792
BUT THANK YOU.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.959
OH.
VIOLET. H-HELLO.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.709
WERE YOU--WERE YOU
LOOKING FOR ME?
PETE, ACTUALLY.

25:06.750 --> 25:09.709
I JUST WANTED TO FINISH
A CONVERSATION WE WERE HAVING.

25:09.750 --> 25:11.709
I HAD SOME FINAL
CHOICE WORDS FOR HIM.

25:11.750 --> 25:13.083
UH, HEY. I'M SORRY.

25:13.125 --> 25:16.542
VIOLET, I-I HAVE A-A PATIENT
IN LABOR AGAIN,

25:16.583 --> 25:18.542
AND BETSEY'S WAITING
FOR ME AT SCHOOL,

25:18.583 --> 25:22.041
AND I CAN'T FIND PETE,
SO CAN, UM, CAN YOU JUST...

25:22.083 --> 25:24.917
GO AHEAD AND... HELP?

25:24.959 --> 25:26.041
HERE.

25:26.083 --> 25:28.041
YEAH, THANKS. OKAY.
GOT HIM?

25:28.083 --> 25:32.875
OKAY. UH, NO, YOU CAN'T GO
INTO LABOR FROM BURPING, KIMMIE.

25:32.917 --> 25:35.166
SO, VIOLET--

25:35.208 --> 25:37.834
IT WAS GOOD TO SEE YOU.

25:41.792 --> 25:44.291
HEY.

25:46.625 --> 25:49.125
OH, HI. UH, THANK YOU
FOR ANSWERING MY PAGE.

25:49.166 --> 25:52.166
UH, HE'S GETTING PREPPED
FOR SURGERY RIGHT NOW.

25:52.208 --> 25:53.834
OKAY.

25:53.875 --> 25:57.417
DANIELLE COULD... BARELY
TAKE CARE OF HERSELF.

25:57.458 --> 25:59.417
I WAS ALWAYS GETTING HER
OUT OF TROUBLE.

25:59.458 --> 26:02.417
YOU KNOW, SHE HAS A REAL KNACK
FOR MAKING MISTAKES.

26:02.458 --> 26:04.417
YEAH. WELL, WE ALL DO.

26:04.458 --> 26:07.250
I KNOW, BUT DRAGGING
THAT POOR BOY AROUND

26:07.291 --> 26:11.041
WITH NO ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS,
NO SAFE PLACE, I JUST--

26:11.083 --> 26:14.792
I WANT BETTER FOR MY GRANDSON.
I CAN AFFORD BETTER.

26:14.834 --> 26:17.792
I HAVE SPOKEN TO MY ATTORNEY,
AND AFTER THE SURGERY,

26:17.834 --> 26:20.166
I'M GONNA PETITION THE COURT
FOR CUSTODY.

26:20.208 --> 26:24.583
HE DOESN'T THINK
THERE'LL BE A PROBLEM.
DON'T YOU?
TAKING ELLIOT AWAY FROM HER?

26:24.625 --> 26:27.667
SHE'S A CHILD.
I'M THE MOTHER.

26:27.709 --> 26:30.166
OKAY...

26:30.208 --> 26:33.166
I'M GONNA SAY SOMETHING TO YOU
WHICH I'VE NEVER SAID,

26:33.208 --> 26:34.834
WELL, TO ANYONE BEFORE.

26:34.875 --> 26:36.834
AND I APOLOGIZE
FOR HOW IT SOUNDS,

26:36.875 --> 26:39.291
BUT... YOU'RE AN ASS.

26:39.333 --> 26:41.542
WHAT?
YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON,

26:41.583 --> 26:43.542
A-AND YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU ARE A MOTHER,

26:43.583 --> 26:46.125
BUT DANIELLE
IS A MOTHER NOW, TOO.

26:46.166 --> 26:49.625
AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU WANT
WHAT'S BEST FOR YOUR DAUGHTER,

26:49.667 --> 26:51.625
BUT SOMETIMES,
EVEN WHEN WE MEAN WELL,

26:51.667 --> 26:53.625
WE END UP HURTING PEOPLE.

26:53.667 --> 26:56.291
I'M JUST SAYING,
THINK ABOUT DANIELLE.

26:56.333 --> 26:59.875
THINK ABOUT WHAT DANIELLE
THINKS ABOUT YOU.

27:03.792 --> 27:05.750
UM, RIGHT NOW...

27:05.792 --> 27:09.792
I HAVE TO THINK FOR HER,
NOT ABOUT HER.

27:13.750 --> 27:16.542
(Dell) YOU'RE NOT IN LABOR.

27:16.583 --> 27:18.041
I FEEL CONTRACTIONS.

27:18.083 --> 27:20.458
LOOK, I WAS SURE
I LOST MY MUCUS PLUG.

27:20.500 --> 27:22.458
YEAH, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
CHECK IT AGAIN.

27:22.500 --> 27:25.458
Y-YOU JUST NEED TO GO HOME,
KIMMIE, AND BE PATIENT.
I CAN'T,

27:25.500 --> 27:28.750
BECAUSE IT'S GONNA HAPPEN,
AND I'M GONNA BE THERE ALONE,

27:28.792 --> 27:30.750
AND I'M NOT GONNA KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

27:30.792 --> 27:32.750
I'M STAYING HERE
BECAUSE I KNOW.

27:32.792 --> 27:35.083
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SEE
ON THAT MONITOR.

27:35.125 --> 27:38.083
I KNOW THIS BABY IS COMING
TODAY. I'M NOT LEAVING, DELL.

27:38.125 --> 27:42.041
I'M HAVING MY BABY.
OKAY, UH, Y-YOU CAN'T FORCE HER
TO COME BEFORE SHE'S READY.

27:42.083 --> 27:44.125
YOU CAN'T READ A BOOK
AND KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING.

27:44.166 --> 27:46.750
I AM TRAINED. I AM TRAINED
TO TELL YOU WHAT TO DO.

27:46.792 --> 27:48.750
AND I CAN'T SIT HERE
AND WAIT WITH YOU

27:48.792 --> 27:50.750
AND BABYSIT YOU
UNTIL SHE COMES, OKAY?

27:50.792 --> 27:53.291
I'M NOT YOUR BABYSITTER.
I'M YOUR MIDWIFE.

27:53.333 --> 27:55.291
AND YOU'RE NOT
MY ONLY RESPONSIBILITY.

27:55.333 --> 27:58.083
AND IF YOU CAN'T BE PATIENT,
IF YOU CAN'T DEAL WITH WAITING,

27:58.125 --> 28:00.875
THEN ARE YOU REALLY GONNA BE
READY FOR HER WHEN SHE COMES,

28:00.917 --> 28:02.709
WHEN SHE'S CRYING
AND BEGGING YOU TO STAY

28:02.750 --> 28:04.709
AND YOU'VE GOT A THOUSAND
OTHER THINGS YOU GOTTA DO,

28:04.750 --> 28:07.041
LIKE I'VE GOT A THOUSAND
OTHER THINGS I'VE GOTTA DO?

28:07.083 --> 28:09.125
YOU'RE NOT
MY ONLY PRIORITY, OKAY?

28:09.166 --> 28:12.041
SO YOU NEED TO PULL IT TOGETHER
AND BE PATIENT.

28:12.083 --> 28:13.959
TAKE YOUR LITTLE BOOK
AND GO HOME

28:14.000 --> 28:16.250
AND DON'T COME BACK
UNTIL IT'S REALLY TIME!
(crying)

28:18.000 --> 28:19.041
HEY.

28:19.083 --> 28:21.166
GOOD LUCK.

28:21.208 --> 28:25.000
YOU THINK I'M CRAZY
FOR THINKING I CAN DO THIS?

28:25.041 --> 28:26.542
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

28:26.583 --> 28:28.542
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT I THINK.

28:28.583 --> 28:30.542
YOU MADE YOUR DECISION.
SURGEONS STEP UP, SAM.

28:30.583 --> 28:32.542
THEY DON'T QUESTION.
THEY DON'T DOUBT.

28:32.583 --> 28:34.542
THEY DON'T LET OTHER PEOPLE
DECIDE FOR THEM

28:34.583 --> 28:37.166
WHAT IS RIGHT
OR WHAT IS WRONG.

28:37.208 --> 28:40.542
BE A SURGEON OR DON'T BE
A SURGEON, BUT DON'T DO THIS.

28:40.583 --> 28:44.750
DON'T WAVER. YOU TOLD DANIELLE
THAT YOU COULD DO THIS.

28:44.792 --> 28:47.458
YOU NEED TO DO IT. NOW GO.

29:02.208 --> 29:04.166
WELL, THANKS
FOR WATCHING HIM.

29:04.208 --> 29:05.792
(Sheldon) YEAH.

29:05.834 --> 29:07.792
BY THE WAY,
YOU'RE ON MY TURF NOW.

29:07.834 --> 29:09.375
YEAH, DULY NOTED.

29:09.417 --> 29:13.458
VIOLET REALLY DOESN'T
LOOK AT HIM, DOES SHE?

29:13.500 --> 29:16.417
IT'S HARD TO WATCH.
YEAH, YOU COULD SAY THAT.

29:22.709 --> 29:25.667
(chuckles) I'M GONNA
HATE MYSELF FOR SAYING THIS...

29:25.709 --> 29:29.625
YOU NEED TO COME DOWNSTAIRS,
AND YOU NEED TO HIRE HIM.

29:29.667 --> 29:31.709
YOU KEEP THIS BABY UP HERE,

29:31.750 --> 29:34.041
YOU'RE GONNA PUSH HER
FURTHER AWAY.

29:34.083 --> 29:36.041
AND EVEN IF YOU
KEPT LUCAS AT HOME,

29:36.083 --> 29:38.458
SEEING YOU EVERY DAY, THAT'S--
THAT'S PUTTING FAILURE

29:38.500 --> 29:41.041
IN HER FACE.
I'M NOT GONNA RUN AWAY
JUST BECAUSE SHE--

29:41.083 --> 29:43.083
YEAH,
I-I COULDN'T POSSIBLY.
YEAH, I--

29:43.125 --> 29:45.083
