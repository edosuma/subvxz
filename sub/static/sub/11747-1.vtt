WEBVTT

01:13.907 --> 01:15.674
You got gas money?

01:15.676 --> 01:16.708
How much?

01:16.710 --> 01:18.110
Twenty bucks.

01:18.112 --> 01:20.345
Oh, I'm not going very far.

01:20.347 --> 01:23.048
Twenty bucks.

01:27.587 --> 01:29.121
Yeah, all right.

01:42.268 --> 01:44.436
Flowers for a lady?

01:44.438 --> 01:46.338
Yeah.
Figured as much.

01:46.340 --> 01:50.075
What's a guy give a shit
about flowers?

01:50.077 --> 01:52.478
Some do, I know.
It's all right.

01:52.480 --> 01:56.215
I got them in augustine,
then my car broke down.

01:56.217 --> 01:58.350
Sadness.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.252
You got that 20?

02:02.989 --> 02:04.623
I figure it's the alternator,

02:04.625 --> 02:07.693
so if you could just drop me off
at the next town,

02:07.695 --> 02:09.360
I'll go find a garage
or something.

02:09.363 --> 02:13.532
See? That's smart.
Good thing I came along.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.300
Where are you going?

02:15.302 --> 02:18.370
Uh, a little place
north of chartrand.

02:18.372 --> 02:21.106
I'm on my way down
to San Antonio.

02:21.108 --> 02:23.041
Helping my brother out.

02:23.043 --> 02:24.209
He came into some money.

02:25.612 --> 02:27.946
How much?
Thousands.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.515
Tens of thousands anyway.

02:29.517 --> 02:32.551
Found it in the car wash.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.853
The car wash?

02:34.855 --> 02:38.123
Yeah. So he tells me.
I didn't believe it either.

02:39.859 --> 02:42.060
What is it?

02:42.062 --> 02:43.428
Drug money?

02:43.430 --> 02:48.500
Ill-gotten gains of some sort.
We know that much.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.802
What if whoever left it
wants it back?

02:50.804 --> 02:53.505
That's what
my brother's wondering.

02:53.507 --> 02:57.409
But once he gets to San Antonio,
those bastards can't touch him.

02:59.212 --> 03:00.946
I thought
he was in San Antonio.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.948
That's what I mean.

03:08.988 --> 03:11.657
Uh, why don't you just
stop up the road

03:11.659 --> 03:13.325
and I'll get out there?

03:13.327 --> 03:16.428
No, thanks. This is fine.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.063
You're going that way
anyway.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.034
Who in fuck are you to say
where I'm going?

03:25.805 --> 03:27.306
It's just right up there.

03:27.308 --> 03:29.608
And you can leave the plant.

03:30.910 --> 03:33.312
Well, no.
I'm not doing that.

03:33.314 --> 03:35.380
You think
i don't have women?

03:35.382 --> 03:38.317
What do you know? I got women
in every corner of the globe.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.419
Globes don't have corners.

03:40.421 --> 03:41.787
Fuck you, whore.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.289
Give it.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.802
Hey.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.437
What time is it?

05:38.439 --> 05:40.439
Around midnight.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.774
Oh.
I could come back.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.609
No, no, no.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.111
Come on in.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.347
I was just sleeping.

05:50.483 --> 05:52.918
I've been walking
in the rain.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.720
<i> So, what happened</i>
<i> to your boyfriend,</i>

05:54.722 --> 05:58.023
<i> the Canadian guy?</i>

05:58.025 --> 05:59.624
<i> He went back to Canada.</i>

06:00.793 --> 06:02.494
Sorry.

06:11.337 --> 06:14.106
I remember
how you used to play.

06:14.108 --> 06:16.007
In high school.

06:16.009 --> 06:19.277
I would listen to you
outside of the music room.

06:19.279 --> 06:23.849
I just had
the strangest dream.

06:23.851 --> 06:27.719
Well, one time, I did that.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.455
And I remember thinking

06:30.457 --> 06:36.094
that the sound of it
was so mournful.

06:36.096 --> 06:39.064
And I made fun of myself
for thinking that word.

06:40.533 --> 06:44.536
Because all I meant
was that I liked it.

06:48.775 --> 06:50.842
Do you wanna hear my dream?

06:50.844 --> 06:53.712
No.

06:53.714 --> 06:58.550
Did things work out
the way you planned?

06:58.552 --> 07:00.752
Back then, I mean.

07:01.954 --> 07:04.189
I didn't plan.

07:05.591 --> 07:08.860
I don't plan now, hardly.

07:08.862 --> 07:12.230
Well, things did not work out
the way I planned.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.501
I should plan more.

07:18.204 --> 07:19.204
Hey.

07:19.206 --> 07:20.205
Hmm.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.774
Do you want me
to play you something?

07:24.811 --> 07:26.178
Sure.

07:44.730 --> 07:47.432
<i> If people really live on</i>
<i> in our memories,</i>

07:47.434 --> 07:49.434
<i> are they aware of it?</i>

07:49.436 --> 07:51.503
<i> And wouldn't it be</i>
<i> kind of repetitive?</i>

07:52.873 --> 07:55.707
<i> Pierre hunter and I grew up</i>
<i> in the driftless area,</i>

07:55.709 --> 07:57.576
<i> in the town of shale.</i>

07:57.578 --> 07:59.611
<i> They say</i>
<i> the last of the glaciers</i>

07:59.613 --> 08:01.413
<i> steered around</i>
<i> the driftless area,</i>

08:01.415 --> 08:03.215
<i> flattened</i>
<i> the rest of the midwest,</i>

08:03.217 --> 08:07.252
<i>but left these rocks and rivers</i>
<i> and ravines untouched.</i>

08:07.254 --> 08:10.589
<i>Not the greatest place to farm,</i>
<i> but good for bow-hunting,</i>

08:10.591 --> 08:12.891
<i> gambling,</i>
<i> writing poems on rocks.</i>

08:12.893 --> 08:16.394
<i> You know, primal things.</i>

08:16.396 --> 08:18.663
<i> Pierre didn't quite fit in,</i>

08:18.665 --> 08:20.999
<i> but this never seemed</i>
<i> to bother him.</i>

08:22.435 --> 08:23.869
<i> We didn't know each other</i>
<i> that well</i>

08:23.871 --> 08:25.570
<i> until one time</i>
<i> in high school</i>

08:25.572 --> 08:28.540
<i> when I had to deliver</i>
<i> some bad news.</i>

08:28.542 --> 08:30.775
Rebecca's breaking up with you.

08:31.944 --> 08:34.446
She wanted you
to be the first to know.

08:36.616 --> 08:39.017
But you knew before I did.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.653
Well,
you're among the first.

08:41.655 --> 08:44.456
Why?

08:44.458 --> 08:47.192
There is no why, Pierre.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.528
It is what it is.

08:49.530 --> 08:52.330
What does that mean?

08:52.332 --> 08:55.166
Of course it is what it is.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.168
If it wasn't,
it wouldn't be.

08:57.170 --> 09:00.539
Well, it's a very popular thing
to say.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.478
<i> I never left shale,</i>
<i> but Pierre did.</i>

09:06.480 --> 09:08.813
<i> For a while anyway.</i>

09:08.815 --> 09:11.750
<i> He went to the university a</i>
<i>couple hundred miles from here.</i>

09:11.752 --> 09:13.919
<i> He was in a string quartet</i>
<i> first semester</i>

09:13.921 --> 09:17.889
<i> but there were</i>
<i> creative differences.</i>

09:21.894 --> 09:24.963
<i> His parents died</i>
<i> in his third year.</i>

09:24.965 --> 09:28.500
<i> First, his mother,</i>
<i> and then his father.</i>

09:28.502 --> 09:32.237
<i> When Pierre was 24,</i>
<i> he was broke so he came home.</i>

09:32.239 --> 09:34.306
<i> He had a bachelor's degree</i>
<i> in science</i>

09:34.308 --> 09:36.808
<i> and a job as a bartender.</i>

09:38.044 --> 09:41.212
<i> What happened to Pierre</i>
<i> is not a normal story.</i>

09:41.214 --> 09:44.549
<i> It ends in violence</i>
<i> and begins with a mistake.</i>

09:44.551 --> 09:47.986
<i>To understand, you need to know</i>
<i> about three people.</i>

09:47.988 --> 09:49.521
<i> One is Shane.</i>

09:53.859 --> 09:55.226
<i> He was mixed up</i>

09:55.228 --> 09:57.429
<i> with a car rental</i>
<i>slash-methamphetamine operation</i>

09:57.431 --> 09:59.297
<i> down in chartrand.</i>

10:02.835 --> 10:06.738
<i> He was called</i>
<i> an itinerant career criminal,</i>

10:06.740 --> 10:09.808
<i> as if that's something</i>
<i> you train for</i>

10:09.810 --> 10:11.476
<i> which I guess you might.</i>

10:34.667 --> 10:37.268
<i> The second person</i>
<i> is Stella.</i>

10:39.005 --> 10:41.506
<i>One time when we were drinking,</i>
<i> Pierre asked me:</i>

10:41.508 --> 10:45.176
<i> "What if there was a language</i>
<i> with only one word in it?"</i>

10:46.545 --> 10:49.547
<i> Maybe the word is Stella.</i>

11:12.271 --> 11:15.707
<i> Yeah, I don't know</i>
<i> where Stella came from.</i>

11:17.309 --> 11:19.077
<i> No one did.</i>

11:19.079 --> 11:21.713
<i> But she knew Tim geer</i>
<i> somehow.</i>

11:23.416 --> 11:25.116
<i> Tim was...</i>

11:25.118 --> 11:26.718
<i> What was Tim?</i>

11:26.720 --> 11:29.287
<i> A hermit, I guess.</i>

11:29.289 --> 11:31.623
<i> Lived on the outskirts</i>
<i> of shale.</i>

11:39.665 --> 11:42.834
<i> Now, you could say that Pierre</i>
<i> fell for the wrong woman,</i>

11:44.270 --> 11:47.005
<i> or you could say,</i>
<i> "what the hell?"</i>

11:47.007 --> 11:48.573
<i> Depends</i>
<i> on who you're asking.</i>

12:32.685 --> 12:34.085
Hmm.

13:14.860 --> 13:17.595
What in the hell?

13:38.250 --> 13:39.317
Fuck.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.300
Hello?

13:56.435 --> 13:57.569
Hello?

15:00.399 --> 15:02.467
Good evening, miss.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.069
Do you mind?

15:05.071 --> 15:06.571
No, no. Go ahead.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.539
I've been expecting you.

15:10.209 --> 15:11.676
Do you know me?

15:11.678 --> 15:14.879
Not personally.
I just had a feeling.

15:19.685 --> 15:20.885
I've been in a fire.

15:20.887 --> 15:23.421
Yeah, I see.
How did you get out?

15:26.558 --> 15:28.860
I don't remember.

15:28.862 --> 15:30.228
Did you get out?

15:32.798 --> 15:37.769
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

15:37.771 --> 15:40.805
Yes, it would appear
that you are.

15:42.007 --> 15:44.742
All right.
Here, let's see. Come on.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.444
You give me your hands.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.354
You have to help me.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.156
See that fire?

15:58.158 --> 16:00.591
I made it.

16:02.328 --> 16:03.795
It's a good one.

16:03.797 --> 16:07.065
I think somebody
made you a fire too.

16:08.634 --> 16:11.035
Does that make a difference?

16:11.037 --> 16:12.971
Big difference.

16:23.749 --> 16:26.851
This was my aunt's house.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.886
She used to go down there
all the time.

16:28.888 --> 16:32.223
And just stand
and look at the lake.

16:32.225 --> 16:35.560
I never really knew why.

16:35.562 --> 16:38.663
She made me promise
never to live here.

16:40.366 --> 16:42.900
These were my aunt's.

16:42.902 --> 16:46.004
Not the latest items from Paris,
but they'll do

16:46.006 --> 16:50.341
until we can get you into town
for something proper.

16:51.877 --> 16:53.478
Try that.

17:01.587 --> 17:03.121
Start with the bar

17:03.123 --> 17:06.924
and then little by little,
we'll add weights.

17:14.266 --> 17:15.665
I'll keep at it.

17:15.667 --> 17:18.536
I got them
at the sports authority.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.371
And take these.

17:24.143 --> 17:25.276
What are these pills?

17:25.278 --> 17:27.310
They're herbal.

17:27.313 --> 17:29.113
Take one daily.

17:29.115 --> 17:31.115
And then I'll be all right?

17:32.518 --> 17:34.852
Well, for a while.
But you want more than that.

17:34.854 --> 17:37.688
Things need to be brought back
into alignment.

17:37.690 --> 17:38.689
And basic principles.

17:40.025 --> 17:42.560
Okay, what am I trying to say?
Balance.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.762
The fire?

17:44.764 --> 17:48.399
The one who did this to you,
he's gotta be made to pay.

17:50.202 --> 17:51.602
Who is he?

17:51.604 --> 17:53.738
I have no idea.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.374
Then how do I find him?

17:56.376 --> 17:58.509
You don't.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.011
I don't.

18:00.013 --> 18:02.447
We could try.

18:02.449 --> 18:03.815
No.

18:03.817 --> 18:06.150
Has to be a regular person.

18:06.152 --> 18:07.819
Out of the blue.

18:07.821 --> 18:10.721
Because it takes random
to find random.

18:10.723 --> 18:14.992
It's gotta be somebody
who knows nothing about this.

18:18.630 --> 18:20.331
Good trip?
Yeah. Good trip.

18:22.401 --> 18:25.870
Say, you have a dog in here?

18:25.872 --> 18:27.338
No.

18:28.740 --> 18:31.642
Hundred dollars for vacuuming
if you have a dog.

18:31.644 --> 18:35.613
It's payday, ned.
The house is gone.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.715
Is it ever.

18:37.717 --> 18:41.252
Do you read the newspapers?
The horoscopes.

18:41.254 --> 18:43.588
Hold onto your hat, Shane.

18:43.590 --> 18:46.023
There was a woman.

18:46.025 --> 18:47.725
Where?

18:47.727 --> 18:50.228
She was watching the house.
She burned to death.

18:54.766 --> 18:56.667
She taught skiing.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.703
You ever ski?
What?

18:58.705 --> 19:00.638
No.
I tried it once.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.441
Couldn't walk across the snow
for the boards on my feet.

19:03.443 --> 19:06.577
But you told me, ned.

19:06.579 --> 19:09.580
You swore to me.
Yeah, well, guess what.

19:09.582 --> 19:13.217
There are things in this world
that we don't know.

19:15.554 --> 19:17.989
Well-- hey, hey!
Easy on the car.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.957
Fuck the fucking car.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.459
In this business--
in any business,

19:21.461 --> 19:23.161
but this business
especially,

19:23.163 --> 19:25.830
you have to be able to rely
on the information.

19:29.635 --> 19:31.369
Hey.

19:46.785 --> 19:48.352
Hey.

19:50.389 --> 19:53.191
Hey.
There's someone down here.

20:00.732 --> 20:01.799
How are you?

20:03.468 --> 20:05.903
Oh, pretty good.

20:05.905 --> 20:06.904
Grab hold of the rope.

20:07.906 --> 20:09.707
I'll pull you up.

20:18.283 --> 20:19.817
You're okay.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.552
Am I?

20:35.033 --> 20:36.834
I'm Stella.

20:36.836 --> 20:39.036
Pierre.

20:40.806 --> 20:42.073
Thank you.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.322
<i> We should get you</i>
<i> out of these clothes.</i>

21:07.599 --> 21:10.735
I'm gonna get you a robe.
Do you need anything else?

21:10.737 --> 21:14.438
I'd take a ride
if you could.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.540
I don't have a car.

21:16.542 --> 21:17.541
Oh.

21:20.812 --> 21:23.381
How'd you find me?

21:23.383 --> 21:26.083
The hole wasn't there
yesterday.

21:26.085 --> 21:27.084
Right.

21:27.086 --> 21:28.886
So...

21:28.888 --> 21:30.788
I figured I'd take a look.

21:32.624 --> 21:34.959
You're a good climber.

21:34.961 --> 21:38.663
Oh, no. Not really.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.699
How long
were you down there?

21:43.035 --> 21:44.101
All night.

21:45.170 --> 21:46.537
I didn't know.

21:46.539 --> 21:47.938
I would've come sooner.

21:47.940 --> 21:50.207
How could you?

21:52.444 --> 21:54.011
I couldn't.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.516
I think you saved my life,
Stella.

21:59.584 --> 22:01.519
I think you're right.

22:01.521 --> 22:05.256
And now I owe you
a great favor

22:05.258 --> 22:07.258
that only I can do.

22:07.260 --> 22:09.727
Is that how it works?

22:10.862 --> 22:12.530
In the stories.

22:12.532 --> 22:15.132
This is a story?

22:16.935 --> 22:18.636
So do you live here?

22:18.638 --> 22:19.937
Yes.

22:19.939 --> 22:23.441
How do you get around
if you don't have a car?

22:23.443 --> 22:25.376
I got a guy
who brings me stuff.

22:25.378 --> 22:28.479
A boyfriend?

22:28.481 --> 22:29.580
No.

22:31.516 --> 22:34.218
I guess I've just been, um,

22:34.220 --> 22:35.953
waiting.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.225
All right. Take it.

23:16.128 --> 23:18.095
Wise decision.

23:19.131 --> 23:20.765
Yeah? Show them.
Yeah.

23:25.337 --> 23:27.605
You have the straight?

23:27.607 --> 23:30.741
Well, I forget.
They're in here somewhere.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.777
Come on.

23:32.779 --> 23:35.279
It's a friendly game.
We're keeping secrets now?

23:35.281 --> 23:36.714
You had the straight
or you didn't.

23:36.716 --> 23:38.749
I don't know.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.651
I say this
in all friendship.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.486
I don't know how you play
where you come from.

23:42.488 --> 23:43.921
Simple act
of common courtesy.

23:43.923 --> 23:47.691
This is how we play
where you are.

23:51.396 --> 23:53.330
I mean,

23:53.332 --> 23:57.301
a guy doesn't show,
that's just bad manners.

23:59.805 --> 24:03.207
Well, he's right that
it's a winner's option.

24:03.209 --> 24:04.308
Some guys will.

24:04.310 --> 24:06.043
Total lack of class.

24:06.045 --> 24:09.513
He always cleans up.
He's that kind of guy.

24:09.515 --> 24:11.148
And he's a tax cheat,
by the way.

24:11.150 --> 24:13.017
Oh, I hate that.

24:13.019 --> 24:16.987
Got a herbicide store
down on railroad street.

24:16.989 --> 24:19.590
Doesn't declare
on cash transactions.

24:19.592 --> 24:22.193
Keeps them in his safe
in his office.

24:24.464 --> 24:26.063
How'd you find that out?

24:26.065 --> 24:28.432
My nephew worked
for him one time,

24:28.434 --> 24:32.102
but it did something
to his skin.

24:32.104 --> 24:35.706
Chemicals or what have you.

24:35.708 --> 24:38.509
Where's railroad street?

24:38.511 --> 24:39.877
Runs along the railroad.

24:39.879 --> 24:42.112
Ah. Of course.

24:45.784 --> 24:47.351
Shut up.

26:04.195 --> 26:05.963
I knew you'd come.

26:07.098 --> 26:08.365
How?

26:08.367 --> 26:10.935
You left your binoculars.

26:10.937 --> 26:12.369
Oh, right.

26:13.573 --> 26:15.506
You should lay out with me.

26:15.508 --> 26:18.242
The sky's an ocean
of vitamin d.

26:19.244 --> 26:21.211
I'm not really
dressed for it.

26:21.213 --> 26:23.981
Take off whatever you want.

26:34.293 --> 26:36.160
You're a modest guy, Pierre.

26:36.162 --> 26:38.228
I never do this.

26:38.230 --> 26:39.930
You should.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.966
You're pale.

26:41.968 --> 26:46.136
I used to work on farms.

26:46.138 --> 26:49.306
Breaking rocks in the sun.

26:50.308 --> 26:51.875
Then I was tan.

26:53.078 --> 26:55.145
I'll bet you were.

27:01.887 --> 27:05.856
Tan and dirty.

27:08.593 --> 27:10.461
I'm glad you came by.

27:11.930 --> 27:15.299
I've been wishing somebody
would come by and check on me.

27:16.301 --> 27:19.803
Or just bring me a book
and say,

27:19.805 --> 27:22.239
"have a look.

27:22.241 --> 27:24.541
It's pretty interesting."

27:25.677 --> 27:27.878
I just read a book.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.380
I can give you that.

27:29.382 --> 27:31.448
Is it interesting?

27:32.617 --> 27:35.085
Well,

27:35.087 --> 27:39.223
he idea is that time
doesn't exist.

27:39.225 --> 27:41.325
That everything
that has ever happened

27:41.327 --> 27:43.761
or ever will happen

27:43.763 --> 27:47.031
was here from the start.

27:47.033 --> 27:49.199
And even different versions
that will happen,

27:49.201 --> 27:52.369
they're all here.

27:53.772 --> 27:54.938
Somewhere.

27:54.940 --> 27:57.541
That's a challenging notion.

27:57.543 --> 28:00.544
But even as I'm reading it,
I'd turn the page and think,

28:00.546 --> 28:03.380
"well, what is that?"

28:03.382 --> 28:06.383
Maybe the passage of time?

28:06.385 --> 28:08.686
But also,

28:11.756 --> 28:14.825
I can turn the page or not.

28:15.994 --> 28:19.630
That's obvious.

28:19.632 --> 28:22.900
It's a small decision.

28:22.902 --> 28:25.836
Has it already been decided?

28:25.838 --> 28:28.472
If something's in motion,

28:28.474 --> 28:30.741
does it have to happen?

28:31.743 --> 28:34.078
I wonder the same thing.

28:44.889 --> 28:46.090
All right, ladies.

28:46.092 --> 28:48.659
We got one twister,
one blue lagoon,

28:48.661 --> 28:52.062
one fallen angel,
one stone fence,

28:52.064 --> 28:54.898
and one gin-and-tonic.

28:55.934 --> 28:57.134
There you are.

28:57.136 --> 28:58.569
I ordered the stone fence.

28:58.571 --> 29:00.437
Oh, okay,
so who had the fallen angel?

29:01.440 --> 29:03.040
Drinks are all fucked up.
No one.

29:03.042 --> 29:05.676
We didn't order a fallen angel.
Where's your mind?

29:05.678 --> 29:08.512
He's in love,
with the lady at the lake.

29:08.514 --> 29:10.781
Ooh.

29:10.783 --> 29:11.849
Cheers.

29:11.851 --> 29:13.383
I'm jealous of him.

29:13.385 --> 29:15.753
Hey, don't do that.

29:38.076 --> 29:39.643
Hey.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.147
You all right?

29:44.649 --> 29:46.450
I'm going home.

29:58.429 --> 30:00.531
How did you get those scars,

30:00.533 --> 30:03.000
you don't mind me asking?

30:04.502 --> 30:06.603
Too much speed one time.

30:06.605 --> 30:09.173
It looks like a bear did it.

30:10.675 --> 30:13.177
I wish it was a bear.

30:25.256 --> 30:26.356
Here we are.

30:26.358 --> 30:29.026
Let me tell you something.

30:29.028 --> 30:31.862
I made a promise
to myself one time

30:31.864 --> 30:34.998
that if I ever get
a pile of cash

30:35.000 --> 30:38.869
I'm going to a surgeon
and make the scars go away.

30:38.871 --> 30:41.338
They probably can.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.440
These days,
it's a snap, I bet.

30:43.442 --> 30:45.309
Yeah.

30:45.311 --> 30:48.078
The cash is the tricky part.

30:48.080 --> 30:49.513
Mm.

30:51.516 --> 30:53.350
Thanks for the ride.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.252
You're welcome.

30:55.254 --> 30:57.855
No, you know what?

30:57.857 --> 30:59.656
Let me give you something.

31:05.930 --> 31:07.331
Thanks.

31:07.333 --> 31:08.932
It's my lucky rock.

31:08.934 --> 31:12.069
I found it at the sand pits.

31:12.071 --> 31:13.770
I think it was made by heat
or something.

31:15.506 --> 31:16.807
Igneous.

31:16.809 --> 31:19.076
Igneous.

31:20.144 --> 31:22.179
Then I quit the drugs.

31:22.181 --> 31:25.949
Now, I'm not saying
there's connection,

31:25.951 --> 31:28.886
but there is a connection.

31:30.855 --> 31:31.855
You should keep it.

31:31.857 --> 31:33.357
I've had it long enough.

31:33.359 --> 31:35.726
Now it can be lucky for you.

32:02.754 --> 32:05.989
Are we looking
for something in particular?

32:05.991 --> 32:07.224
Uh...

32:07.226 --> 32:08.625
Do you have roses?

32:08.627 --> 32:09.860
Do we have roses?

32:09.862 --> 32:11.395
We have the largest
rose selection

32:11.397 --> 32:13.030
in the upper midwest.

32:13.032 --> 32:15.899
This one's called, uh...

32:15.901 --> 32:17.301
Ross mirren.

32:17.303 --> 32:18.402
Uh-huh.

32:18.404 --> 32:20.837
Hide shed,
i got a young man here

32:20.839 --> 32:22.773
looking
for a Ross mirren rose.

32:22.775 --> 32:24.408
<i> How many?</i>

32:24.410 --> 32:26.310
How many?

32:26.312 --> 32:27.477
Roses?

32:27.479 --> 32:28.845
Bushes.

32:28.847 --> 32:30.580
<i> We don't sell cut roses.</i>

32:30.582 --> 32:31.581
No.

32:33.051 --> 32:34.351
One bush.

32:35.420 --> 32:36.887
Please.

32:43.094 --> 32:44.594
Be calm.

32:48.599 --> 32:50.400
Be calm.

32:50.402 --> 32:52.402
You've been in an accident.

32:53.438 --> 32:55.605
What time is it?

32:57.142 --> 32:58.608
It's 7:30.

32:58.610 --> 33:00.344
Is there anything broken?

33:00.346 --> 33:03.580
Well, not that
you'd necessarily know.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.332
Now I'm upset.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.468
I think I'd better call
an ambulance.

33:24.470 --> 33:25.469
No.

33:25.471 --> 33:28.138
You can't panic.

33:28.140 --> 33:30.774
These things happen
all the time.

33:41.452 --> 33:42.986
I'm gonna need your car.

33:42.988 --> 33:46.390
You're not thinking clearly.
You've been in an accident.

33:46.392 --> 33:48.191
I'm fully aware
I've been in an accident,

33:48.193 --> 33:49.359
so please stop saying that

33:49.361 --> 33:51.695
and give me the keys
to your car.

33:54.833 --> 33:56.133
You're not threatening me?

33:56.135 --> 33:58.468
Now you're not
thinking clearly.

34:01.439 --> 34:05.842
But how am I gonna get home?

34:05.844 --> 34:07.878
I don't know.

34:07.880 --> 34:09.612
Christ, you'll walk,
i imagine.

34:09.614 --> 34:11.114
Why is everyone
always expecting me

34:11.116 --> 34:13.016
to take them somewhere?

34:43.514 --> 34:45.782
<i> Yeah I'm about 40 minutes</i>
<i> north of you.</i>

34:45.784 --> 34:47.250
<i> That's right.</i>

34:48.286 --> 34:50.387
<i> Well, I could use a place.</i>

34:53.056 --> 34:54.925
<i> A place to think.</i>

35:27.859 --> 35:29.693
I think we all know
each other.

35:31.195 --> 35:33.363
We know who he is.

35:33.365 --> 35:36.133
There's a car out front
you should get rid of.

35:36.135 --> 35:37.567
Why don't you get rid of it?

35:37.569 --> 35:39.302
I'll leave it where it is,
if that's where you want it.

35:39.304 --> 35:41.037
Well, here, here.
Let's not fight.

35:41.039 --> 35:42.439
Get the car out of here.

35:42.441 --> 35:45.008
Lyle, move that car, will you?

35:45.010 --> 35:46.209
Where?

35:46.211 --> 35:49.112
Take it where we took
the other one.

35:49.114 --> 35:52.382
Jean, you follow in the jetta,
bring Lyle back.

35:52.384 --> 35:53.583
I'm on it.

36:03.294 --> 36:05.028
Want some speed?

36:05.030 --> 36:06.696
Something to eat?

36:07.899 --> 36:10.133
I'm not too hungry.

36:19.043 --> 36:21.611
Thank you, sir.

36:24.316 --> 36:27.851
Let the cares of the day
fade away.

36:35.826 --> 36:37.661
I lost some money.

36:39.463 --> 36:42.599
Jackass kid I picked up
on the highway,

36:44.636 --> 36:47.404
knocked me out cold,
took the money.

36:51.008 --> 36:52.943
What do you know about him?

36:54.078 --> 36:55.779
Not much.

36:55.781 --> 36:58.448
His car broke down.

36:58.450 --> 37:00.150
His car was on the highway?

37:01.285 --> 37:03.153
Apparently.

37:03.155 --> 37:05.322
Did you go find it?

37:05.324 --> 37:06.356
It was broke down.

37:06.358 --> 37:10.193
For the plates and the vin,
dumb-ass,

37:10.195 --> 37:13.430
by which
you might then locate him.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.132
Shit.

37:18.337 --> 37:20.503
No, I didn't.

37:20.505 --> 37:22.739
That's so basic.

37:23.976 --> 37:25.642
Where can I stay?

37:25.644 --> 37:28.111
There's a room next door
with an exercise bike.

37:28.113 --> 37:29.779
You can take that.

37:29.781 --> 37:32.249
I work out there.

37:32.251 --> 37:36.152
Luanne, you do me a favor
and shut the fuck up.

37:36.154 --> 37:39.256
What are you gonna do
with the money?

37:39.258 --> 37:42.025
The money goes to the woman.

37:43.561 --> 37:46.463
Because she gave you
the rock?

37:46.465 --> 37:50.000
She said, "don't forget."

37:50.002 --> 37:53.837
If she ever found
a pile of money.

37:54.839 --> 37:57.207
And then this happens.

37:59.877 --> 38:03.913
Is that how much it costs,
the operation she needs?

38:03.915 --> 38:06.082
Plastic surgery.

38:07.118 --> 38:09.019
I don't know.

38:09.021 --> 38:11.354
That shit can't be cheap.

38:11.356 --> 38:14.724
The man will come
for the money.

38:14.726 --> 38:16.760
Well, let him.

38:16.762 --> 38:18.528
That's what I say.

38:18.530 --> 38:22.632
Takes my 20 bucks,
steals my plant

38:22.634 --> 38:24.768
which I went and got
for you.

38:26.370 --> 38:28.772
Too bad for him.

38:29.807 --> 38:31.241
And he kicks me.

38:31.243 --> 38:33.643
You're all hopped up.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.781
I won.

38:37.783 --> 38:39.049
I keep thinking about it.

38:39.051 --> 38:41.251
I never even won
a lottery ticket.

38:41.253 --> 38:44.721
No, you did good, Pierre.

38:46.257 --> 38:47.991
Can you defend yourself?

38:49.460 --> 38:51.528
Probably.

38:51.530 --> 38:54.631
Do you have weapons?

38:54.633 --> 38:58.635
I have a 12-Gauge
and a rifle,

38:58.637 --> 39:01.638
but I don't really think of them
as weapons.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.407
Oh, and also a knife

39:04.409 --> 39:06.776
that somebody found
at the bar.

39:06.778 --> 39:08.144
It's called
a butterfly knife,

39:08.146 --> 39:11.748
but it really looks nothing
like a butterfly.

39:15.119 --> 39:17.687
This is a serious thing.

39:20.224 --> 39:22.692
Why do you take it
so lightly?

39:24.862 --> 39:27.197
What am I supposed to do?

39:27.199 --> 39:28.264
Kill him?

39:29.867 --> 39:32.168
People die for less.

39:32.170 --> 39:36.339
At weddings, sometimes.
Things get out of hand.

39:36.341 --> 39:39.008
You don't know
what will happen.

39:40.277 --> 39:42.779
I would've killed him.

39:42.781 --> 39:45.749
I was so mad.

39:45.751 --> 39:48.251
I was outraged.

39:54.359 --> 39:57.293
Tore up the rosebush.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.299
We could plant it.

40:04.535 --> 40:06.436
It will grow.

40:11.308 --> 40:13.543
We took care of your car.

40:13.545 --> 40:15.678
Thanks.

40:15.680 --> 40:18.548
Ned said to come tell you.

40:18.550 --> 40:19.816
Noted.

40:19.818 --> 40:22.018
And see if you want
anything else.

40:22.020 --> 40:24.020
I'm all set.

40:24.022 --> 40:26.756
Any old thing.

40:33.197 --> 40:34.197
Oh.

40:35.199 --> 40:37.400
Oh.

40:37.402 --> 40:39.602
What kind of place is this?

40:40.604 --> 40:42.605
It's nedland.

40:43.774 --> 40:45.341
You wanna get laid?

40:45.343 --> 40:47.744
I'm all hyper.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.080
You don't have to.
Ned isn't anything.

40:52.483 --> 40:54.384
He's my boss.
Where?

40:54.386 --> 40:57.720
The rent-a-car.
You mind if I smoke?

40:57.722 --> 40:59.589
No, go ahead.

41:14.705 --> 41:17.640
What would you do
if you had to find someone?

41:20.811 --> 41:25.448
Hmm, first,
analyze the information.

41:25.450 --> 41:28.485
Name is Pierre.

41:28.487 --> 41:31.321
He's deceptively
simple-looking.

41:32.623 --> 41:35.558
Lives up north.

41:35.560 --> 41:38.194
Has a girlfriend
who likes roses.

41:40.331 --> 41:43.800
Not much to analyze.

41:43.802 --> 41:46.169
However, there ain't a ton
of pierres around here.

41:47.171 --> 41:49.038
I'm finding him.

41:50.007 --> 41:52.075
That will happen.

41:52.077 --> 41:53.943
Well, I'll sleep on it.

41:53.945 --> 41:55.778
Stay a minute.

41:58.749 --> 41:59.749
Yeah, why?

42:02.653 --> 42:04.687
I want you to sit
on my back.

42:04.689 --> 42:07.357
Is that a sexual thing
for you?

42:07.359 --> 42:09.325
No.

42:10.561 --> 42:13.229
I think I hurt it when I ran
my truck off the road.

42:14.999 --> 42:16.366
Okay.

42:46.498 --> 42:48.264
This is a very good seat.

42:48.266 --> 42:50.233
Much better.

42:58.142 --> 43:00.810
<i> Can you hear the lake</i>
<i> from here?</i>

43:02.012 --> 43:04.414
<i> Sometimes.</i>

43:04.416 --> 43:06.215
<i> Do you hear it?</i>

43:09.520 --> 43:11.688
<i> I don't know.</i>

43:17.127 --> 43:19.696
<i>Can you hear what I'm thinking?</i>

43:21.665 --> 43:24.233
You don't want the night
to end.

43:31.375 --> 43:33.176
What else?

43:40.851 --> 43:43.152
Too many things.

43:47.591 --> 43:49.626
What do you do for ned?

43:50.761 --> 43:52.862
Various things.

43:53.864 --> 43:56.599
Last job,
i burned a house down.

43:56.601 --> 43:58.534
Insurance bid?

43:58.536 --> 44:02.672
No, it was some couple
who got divorced.

44:02.674 --> 44:06.509
She got the vacation house.
He was bitter.

44:06.511 --> 44:09.812
Tale often told.

44:09.814 --> 44:12.749
It was supposed to be empty,

44:12.751 --> 44:17.053
but it turns out

44:19.390 --> 44:21.524
there was somebody there.

44:21.526 --> 44:23.092
Uh-oh.

44:23.094 --> 44:24.627
Yeah.

44:25.896 --> 44:28.431
And what do you do for ned?

44:29.433 --> 44:31.434
Nothing.

44:31.436 --> 44:34.103
I just bump people up.

44:34.105 --> 44:35.805
What's that?

44:37.976 --> 44:41.077
Hmm, they come in,
they want the economy car,

44:41.079 --> 44:43.813
and I...

44:46.450 --> 44:48.317
And so, what happened?

44:48.319 --> 44:50.119
To the person in the house.

44:50.121 --> 44:52.188
She died.

44:52.190 --> 44:54.057
Jesus.

44:55.426 --> 44:57.760
Haunts me to this day.

45:00.531 --> 45:03.399
It was not supposed
to be that way.

45:09.106 --> 45:10.773
What were you saying?

45:10.775 --> 45:12.141
"They come in."

45:12.143 --> 45:13.476
I just...

45:14.878 --> 45:18.514
Bump them up to something
more expensive than they want.

45:18.516 --> 45:19.949
Different car.

45:22.886 --> 45:24.854
How do you do that?

45:25.889 --> 45:27.824
It's easy.

45:27.826 --> 45:31.294
I just talk low and slow

45:31.296 --> 45:33.029
and wear a gold necklace

45:33.031 --> 45:35.765
with my shirt open
a button too many.

45:37.701 --> 45:39.368
And then what?

45:39.370 --> 45:40.970
That's it.

45:42.806 --> 45:45.708
Just in the appearance?

45:45.710 --> 45:47.176
Yeah.

45:48.312 --> 45:51.013
Most people in the industry
know that.

45:51.015 --> 45:55.218
I think most people kind of
wanna be bumped up anyway.

46:03.360 --> 46:05.294
Do you know when it will be?

46:05.296 --> 46:07.930
Depends on how smart he is.

46:10.534 --> 46:12.034
What do you know?

46:12.036 --> 46:15.671
Everything that needs to happen
is gonna happen.

46:16.707 --> 46:18.040
I wanna do it.

46:18.042 --> 46:19.909
Um, well, you can't.

46:19.911 --> 46:23.780
I'm strong now.
I'm feeling great.

46:23.782 --> 46:25.681
I don't mean
you're not strong.

46:30.854 --> 46:32.421
I mean,
why shouldn't the kid do it?

46:32.423 --> 46:33.623
He doesn't know.

46:33.625 --> 46:35.358
It isn't fair.

46:35.360 --> 46:37.560
Fair to who?

46:37.562 --> 46:39.996
He could get hurt.

46:40.998 --> 46:43.166
Well, I suppose
you could tell him.

46:43.168 --> 46:45.334
I want to tell him.

46:45.336 --> 46:47.036
He won't believe you.

46:47.038 --> 46:49.472
He would.

46:49.474 --> 46:51.707
I feel he would from me.

46:52.743 --> 46:53.976
It would still happen.

46:58.515 --> 47:00.883
Hi, is this bad--
a bad timing?

47:00.885 --> 47:02.819
What can I do for you?

47:02.821 --> 47:06.389
Well, it's a little awkward.

47:06.391 --> 47:09.192
Maybe I shouldn't have come,

47:09.194 --> 47:11.127
but I'm Carrie Sloan,
I'm a friend of Pierre's.

47:11.129 --> 47:14.664
Oh. You're Carrie.

47:15.666 --> 47:16.866
He speaks highly of you.

47:16.868 --> 47:19.735
Oh, wow, that's nice.

47:19.737 --> 47:21.637
Well, you don't have anything
to worry about.

47:21.639 --> 47:24.373
You know, him and i
are like brother and sister.

47:24.375 --> 47:26.809
When his parents died,
he didn't really have anyone,

47:26.811 --> 47:31.080
so I kind of took him
under my wing.

47:32.749 --> 47:34.750
Or he took me under his wing,
you know?

47:34.752 --> 47:36.485
There was--
there was wings involved.

47:37.487 --> 47:38.721
That was kind of you.

47:40.991 --> 47:46.529
I know that, you know,
you're very special to him.

47:46.531 --> 47:50.199
You are. Did you know that?

47:50.201 --> 47:51.400
And I just wanted to say

47:51.402 --> 47:54.537
because, you know,
I've been hurt before,

47:54.539 --> 47:56.138
but I'm not gonna bore you
with that.

47:56.140 --> 47:58.174
I just...

47:58.176 --> 48:01.811
I really don't want that
for Pierre.

48:03.080 --> 48:05.014
No.

48:05.016 --> 48:06.616
I understand.

48:07.618 --> 48:09.118
Okay.

48:20.197 --> 48:21.998
Are you all right?

48:23.867 --> 48:26.068
What are we doing to Pierre?

48:31.541 --> 48:34.176
You saved his life, Stella.
You know that.

48:34.178 --> 48:37.480
All this has been extra time
for him.

48:37.482 --> 48:40.983
Christ, there'd be grass growing
on his grave right now

48:40.985 --> 48:42.752
if it wasn't for you.

48:43.954 --> 48:45.054
Don't say that.

48:45.056 --> 48:46.255
I'm sorry. It's true.

48:46.257 --> 48:48.291
I thought
this was what you wanted.

48:48.293 --> 48:52.628
I did, too,
but I don't know.

48:52.630 --> 48:56.299
Well, if you talk to him,
and I see that you will,

48:56.301 --> 48:58.301
there's a place for it.

48:59.469 --> 49:00.870
Where?

49:00.872 --> 49:02.571
It's an orchard.

49:07.244 --> 49:09.478
Hey, reverend.

49:09.480 --> 49:11.047
You need anything else?

49:13.350 --> 49:15.484
You know
that little green convertible

49:15.486 --> 49:16.585
your dad used to drive?

49:18.922 --> 49:21.324
The mg.

49:21.326 --> 49:23.025
Sure.

49:24.461 --> 49:27.697
It went
in the house auction.

49:27.699 --> 49:29.532
Dad wasn't very good
with money.

49:29.534 --> 49:31.200
I think I saw it
the other day.

49:31.202 --> 49:34.303
It was up for sale
where they work on my car.

49:34.305 --> 49:36.205
Yeah.

49:38.508 --> 49:42.812
You know,
he rebuilt it himself.

49:44.047 --> 49:46.849
The man knew stuff
about cars.

49:49.319 --> 49:50.753
Come outside.

49:53.623 --> 49:56.192
Are you serious, John?

49:56.194 --> 49:57.426
What did you give for it?

49:57.428 --> 50:01.364
Not much.
I baptized the guy's kids,

50:01.366 --> 50:04.100
so cut me a deal.

50:05.435 --> 50:07.837
What are we looking at?

50:09.773 --> 50:12.408
This is my dad's car.

50:13.643 --> 50:15.678
Well, it was.

50:16.880 --> 50:17.880
It's yours.

50:19.182 --> 50:22.184
Oh, man. You can't do that.

50:22.186 --> 50:24.353
It should stay in the family.

50:51.948 --> 50:53.716
<i> Hey, Keith.</i>

50:55.452 --> 50:58.554
You ever have anyone
after you?

51:00.557 --> 51:02.558
After me?

51:04.795 --> 51:07.096
That wanted to hurt you.

51:12.302 --> 51:14.403
One time. Yeah.

51:15.806 --> 51:17.706
There was this friend
of mine,

51:17.708 --> 51:20.042
we were in a bar
in lacrosse.

51:20.044 --> 51:24.980
Somebody was giving him a
hard time about something and...

51:25.982 --> 51:28.250
So I tell the guy
to shut up.

51:28.252 --> 51:30.886
Not my friend.
The other guy.

51:32.355 --> 51:34.056
And he did.

51:36.526 --> 51:41.030
But then, him and his friends
ran across me

51:41.032 --> 51:44.400
a few weeks later
at another bar,

51:44.402 --> 51:46.735
and they, uh...

51:48.505 --> 51:51.707
Beat me up pretty good.

51:53.410 --> 51:55.644
So don't do what I did.

51:57.114 --> 51:59.582
I did nothing.

51:59.584 --> 52:02.051
That was a mistake.

52:07.057 --> 52:08.524
So I got it figured out.

52:08.526 --> 52:10.559
I think you should call
the fire departments.

52:10.561 --> 52:12.027
Why?

52:12.029 --> 52:14.930
Firemen know everything
in these little burghs.

52:14.932 --> 52:17.399
And say what?

52:17.401 --> 52:20.202
You gave this kid named Pierre
a ride, right?

52:20.204 --> 52:21.303
Yeah.
You did.

52:21.305 --> 52:24.507
So he left something valuable
in your car,

52:24.509 --> 52:26.575
and you're just trying
to be a good samaritan.

52:26.577 --> 52:29.211
Valuable? What would be--?
Money is valuable.

52:29.213 --> 52:32.915
Mm, not credible.
You would keep it.

52:32.917 --> 52:34.483
True.

52:34.485 --> 52:36.752
Something valuable to him.

52:37.787 --> 52:39.955
How about a harmonica?

52:39.957 --> 52:41.257
I had a harmonica once.

52:41.259 --> 52:42.858
I like that.
Yeah?

52:42.860 --> 52:45.995
And it's, like, fancy,
not some dime-store shit.

52:45.997 --> 52:46.996
Ah.

52:46.998 --> 52:49.832
I printed out a list
of fire departments.

52:54.538 --> 52:56.505
I'm Mr. bromley.

52:56.507 --> 52:58.440
I just got in
from Milwaukee.

52:58.442 --> 53:00.042
I should have
a Malibu reserved.

53:00.044 --> 53:02.578
Why, yes.
Here you are, Mr. bromley.

53:02.580 --> 53:05.147
I'll just need a license
and a credit card.

53:05.149 --> 53:09.752
Hi, is this
the arcadia fire department?

53:09.754 --> 53:11.153
Yeah.

53:11.155 --> 53:12.288
No. There's no fire.

53:12.290 --> 53:14.757
Is something wrong?
I can hold.

53:15.959 --> 53:17.993
No. I'm sorry.
I'm just confused.

53:17.995 --> 53:19.995
You look so much younger
in person

53:19.997 --> 53:21.597
than you do
in your photograph.

53:21.599 --> 53:22.998
Hey, funny story.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.533
I hope you don't mind.

53:24.535 --> 53:27.069
You know, security and all.
Picked up this young fellow.

53:27.071 --> 53:28.204
No, I can understand that.

53:28.206 --> 53:29.838
I'm in the security business
myself.

53:29.840 --> 53:32.541
Well, thank god someone is
these days.

53:32.543 --> 53:37.613
When he left, he forgot
his harmonica in my truck.

53:37.615 --> 53:40.916
It's a beautiful instrument,
all gold inlay and such.

53:40.918 --> 53:42.518
I think
he said his grandfather...

53:42.520 --> 53:45.721
By the way, we've got
a special today on the cts,

53:45.723 --> 53:47.089
it's a caddie.

53:47.091 --> 53:48.958
Not trying to force it on you
or anything,

53:48.960 --> 53:51.393
but a lot of businessmen
like to know

53:51.395 --> 53:53.629
because it's just
a little bit nicer.

53:53.631 --> 53:55.564
But the Malibu's on the lot?

53:55.566 --> 53:56.899
- Sure is.
- Name is Pierre.

53:56.901 --> 53:59.735
It's back by the fence.
Supposed to be very peppy.

53:59.737 --> 54:01.203
What I'm wondering is,

54:01.205 --> 54:07.309
do you know of any pierres
in your fire area?

54:07.311 --> 54:08.477
No. Go ahead, please.

54:08.479 --> 54:10.179
And how much more is the cts?

54:10.181 --> 54:11.647
Twenty-nine dollars
and change.

54:11.649 --> 54:12.681
Oh, good, good.

54:12.683 --> 54:14.483
I'll tell you what I'll do.

54:14.485 --> 54:17.486
What will you do,
Mr. bromley?

54:20.858 --> 54:22.725
And that is how that's done.

54:24.729 --> 54:28.697
With that guy's insecurity, you
can see why there's no security.

54:28.699 --> 54:32.701
Which reminds me,
I'll be needing a car.

54:32.703 --> 54:34.403
Take the Malibu.

54:37.641 --> 54:40.509
I heard, uh...

54:40.511 --> 54:42.811
Carrie came by
the other day.

54:42.813 --> 54:45.247
She seems very sweet.

54:45.249 --> 54:50.252
I guess, um,
there was a guy here?

54:53.690 --> 54:56.292
Tim geer?

54:56.294 --> 54:58.093
Yeah.

54:58.095 --> 55:01.297
I told you, he brings me
groceries and things.

55:04.701 --> 55:06.268
Hey.

55:08.505 --> 55:11.006
There something
you wanna tell me?

55:12.942 --> 55:15.444
Carrie's right.

55:15.446 --> 55:17.579
I've been thinking about me,

55:17.581 --> 55:20.582
and I haven't been thinking
about you.

55:21.685 --> 55:23.952
You don't have to think
about me.

55:25.689 --> 55:28.023
Pierre, listen to me.

55:28.025 --> 55:32.661
Did you ever wanna
call something off,

55:32.663 --> 55:35.130
but you didn't know how?

55:46.109 --> 55:48.877
I don't want you
to leave me.

55:51.448 --> 55:54.416
I want you
to always be right here.

55:56.586 --> 55:59.121
I know it's not real,

56:01.825 --> 56:04.193
but that's what I want.

56:05.528 --> 56:07.062
Okay?

57:08.758 --> 57:11.627
All right, you skinny fucker.
Let's go.

57:34.751 --> 57:36.351
Remember me?

57:36.353 --> 57:38.220
I-- no.

57:38.222 --> 57:40.189
Pierre?

57:40.191 --> 57:43.492
Uh, don. don Thomas.

57:46.362 --> 57:47.663
What are you doing?

57:48.898 --> 57:50.632
You're telling me
your name is Thomas?

57:50.634 --> 57:52.701
Uh, yes, sir.
Donald r. Thomas.

57:52.703 --> 57:55.671
Why does your license plate
say "hunter"?

57:55.673 --> 57:58.006
Yeah. I hunt pheasants.
I like to--

57:58.008 --> 58:02.244
to hunt them. My girlfriend
got me that from the dmv.

58:02.246 --> 58:05.481
Where's Pierre?
I don't know any Pierre, sir.

58:05.483 --> 58:07.883
My--

58:07.885 --> 58:11.887
my grandmother's birthday party
is in eau Claire. I'm--

58:11.889 --> 58:15.324
I'm just passing through.

58:21.465 --> 58:23.298
Goddamn it.

58:39.082 --> 58:41.316
Excuse me.

58:41.318 --> 58:44.052
I thought
you were someone else.

58:46.824 --> 58:48.657
I feel sorry
for that person.

58:52.295 --> 58:53.695
No.

59:00.037 --> 59:02.571
I'm getting out
of the car now.

59:03.540 --> 59:05.440
I'm fully armed, don.

59:05.442 --> 59:07.743
If you so much as turn your head
in my direction,

59:07.745 --> 59:10.679
that will be the last thing
you do with your head.

59:10.681 --> 59:13.015
I can't see anything anyway.

59:13.017 --> 59:15.284
Well, nonetheless.

59:33.636 --> 59:35.337
What a night.

59:38.007 --> 59:40.175
And it's not over.

59:42.512 --> 59:45.080
What are you doing?
Undressing you.

59:45.082 --> 59:46.882
Hold this.

59:48.418 --> 59:50.552
I need this shirt.

59:52.855 --> 59:55.490
You need to open up.
So I hear.

59:55.492 --> 59:56.925
I could cut you open.

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:09.905
Then you'd be alone.

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:37.032
<i> Shane.</i>

01:00:38.034 --> 01:00:39.968
<i> Shane.</i>

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:43.905
When you ski, you'll fall.

01:00:43.907 --> 01:00:47.376
Everyone does it.
There's no shame in it.

01:00:47.378 --> 01:00:52.514
The main thing
is don't fight it.

01:00:52.516 --> 01:00:54.650
Just accept
that you're falling.

01:01:21.477 --> 01:01:23.078
Mm.

01:01:25.982 --> 01:01:27.983
Hello?

01:01:29.086 --> 01:01:30.852
What in the name of god
do you want?

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:31.853
<i> I want ned.</i>

01:01:34.258 --> 01:01:38.360
Son of a bitch
has no consideration whatsoever.

01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:39.494
Yeah?

01:01:41.298 --> 01:01:44.099
Whoa, whoa, here, now.
Calm down, calm down.

01:01:44.101 --> 01:01:45.867
It's just a kid.
<i> A nightmare.</i>

01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:49.438
Shane, the woman is dead.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.506
You're letting
your emotions run wild.

01:01:51.508 --> 01:01:53.909
<i> Tell me you'll help.</i>
<i> Please, ned.</i>

01:01:53.911 --> 01:01:55.711
Fuck.

01:01:56.913 --> 01:02:01.149
All right. This is ridiculous.
Where are you?

01:02:01.151 --> 01:02:02.451
What day's today?

01:02:02.453 --> 01:02:03.952
Tuesday?
<i> Wednesday.</i>

01:02:03.954 --> 01:02:06.855
Oh, yeah. Wednesday now.

01:02:06.857 --> 01:02:08.423
I'll be there Friday night.

01:02:08.425 --> 01:02:09.958
<i> Why the fuck Friday?</i>

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:12.761
Because I have a business
to think of.

01:02:12.763 --> 01:02:13.762
<i> I don't give a fuck--</i>

01:02:13.764 --> 01:02:16.031
also, I want half.

01:02:18.102 --> 01:02:20.268
Yeah. Well, what's fair?
<i> A third.</i>

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:22.537
<i> It's 30,000 and you get 10.</i>
No.

01:02:22.539 --> 01:02:24.406
<i> Ten. I'll give you 10,</i>
no.

01:02:24.408 --> 01:02:26.675
<i> That's all. Ten.</i>

01:02:27.677 --> 01:02:29.578
Yeah. All right.

01:02:32.783 --> 01:02:36.318
Our friend Shane's losing
his fucking marbles.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.353
Your friend Shane.

01:02:46.029 --> 01:02:48.764
I know where we are.

01:02:48.766 --> 01:02:51.600
I used to come up here
as a kid.

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:55.370
There's an orchard up here.

01:02:55.372 --> 01:02:57.372
Yeah.

01:02:57.374 --> 01:02:59.007
That's right.

01:03:00.643 --> 01:03:03.478
I'd bring books up there
to read.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.514
I can picture that.

01:03:05.516 --> 01:03:07.916
Watch out. There's...

01:03:07.918 --> 01:03:10.519
Some busted cattle thing
right up here.

01:03:10.521 --> 01:03:11.520
A what?

01:03:12.722 --> 01:03:16.291
A, uh, cattle guard.

01:03:16.293 --> 01:03:19.394
Kept the cows
from coming through.

01:03:22.665 --> 01:03:24.232
Come here.

01:03:28.838 --> 01:03:30.005
Watch your head.

01:03:30.007 --> 01:03:31.740
Thanks.

01:04:01.737 --> 01:04:03.605
You know...

01:04:05.107 --> 01:04:08.009
They used to keep
the books...

01:04:09.111 --> 01:04:10.946
Right here.

01:04:12.348 --> 01:04:14.082
What books?

01:04:14.084 --> 01:04:16.651
<i> Wind in the willows,</i>

01:04:16.653 --> 01:04:18.653
<i> phantom tollbooth.</i>

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:22.691
Pierre,

01:04:22.693 --> 01:04:25.594
I'm gonna tell you
something now.

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:29.698
Okay.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:34.569
And it's going
to seem strange.

01:04:34.571 --> 01:04:39.975
It's going to seem
real strange.

01:04:39.977 --> 01:04:41.409
Okay.

01:04:41.411 --> 01:04:45.981
I died in a fire in St. ivo.

01:04:49.152 --> 01:04:50.252
Okay.

01:04:50.254 --> 01:04:52.954
You can look it up.

01:04:54.423 --> 01:04:56.524
It was arson.

01:04:59.228 --> 01:05:02.464
Now,
do you believe all that?

01:05:06.235 --> 01:05:07.769
No.

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:13.208
<i> I think everyone goes</i>
<i> from life to life,</i>

01:05:14.877 --> 01:05:16.811
<i> but they forget.</i>

01:05:19.715 --> 01:05:22.517
<i> They dream things</i>
<i> and let them go.</i>

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:30.158
Maybe I'll dream this.

01:05:34.063 --> 01:05:36.631
I got out of college

01:05:36.633 --> 01:05:39.768
and I taught skiing.

01:05:40.836 --> 01:05:42.904
That's all true.

01:05:45.007 --> 01:05:47.042
I had a client...

01:05:48.244 --> 01:05:50.612
<i> Who was going on a cruise</i>
<i> to Alaska,</i>

01:05:50.614 --> 01:05:54.082
<i> and she needed someone</i>
<i> to watch her house.</i>

01:05:54.084 --> 01:05:56.584
<i> I loved it at first.</i>

01:05:56.586 --> 01:05:59.654
<i> I went around looking</i>
<i> at all the things, thinking,</i>

01:06:01.223 --> 01:06:03.525
<i> "what if it was mine?"</i>

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.161
<i> The night it happened,</i>

01:06:06.163 --> 01:06:09.064
<i> I had supper</i>
<i> and a bottle of wine.</i>

01:06:10.099 --> 01:06:12.067
<i> Not all of it.</i>

01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:13.301
<i> More than I should have.</i>

01:06:15.571 --> 01:06:19.174
<i> The fire wept</i>
<i> with the open window.</i>

01:06:19.176 --> 01:06:22.043
<i> It was like something alive</i>

01:06:22.045 --> 01:06:23.912
<i> that couldn't breathe.</i>

01:06:36.258 --> 01:06:38.493
<i> Tim geer helped me.</i>

01:06:41.364 --> 01:06:43.365
He knows about these things.

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:50.338
I keep hearing that name.
I haven't even seen the guy.

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:54.075
We needed someone
to find the arsonist.

01:06:54.077 --> 01:06:55.744
Shane.

01:06:57.346 --> 01:06:58.947
Tim knew you would do it.

01:06:58.949 --> 01:07:01.082
How did he know that?

01:07:01.084 --> 01:07:03.985
He just does.

01:07:03.987 --> 01:07:06.888
He's very strange.

01:07:07.890 --> 01:07:10.492
Okay. So...

01:07:10.494 --> 01:07:12.560
I find him--

01:07:13.562 --> 01:07:15.597
did find him.

01:07:18.434 --> 01:07:20.035
What's it all for?

01:07:20.037 --> 01:07:22.604
It will make things right.

01:07:23.672 --> 01:07:26.875
It will make things right
with me.

01:07:26.877 --> 01:07:28.676
Jesus.

01:07:30.513 --> 01:07:33.348
This is the thing
I'm supposed to do.

01:07:33.350 --> 01:07:36.351
Nothing says
that you have to.

01:07:36.353 --> 01:07:38.186
Pierre, go away for a while.

01:07:38.188 --> 01:07:40.688
A week. It'll be over.

01:07:42.324 --> 01:07:44.726
I don't wanna go away.

01:07:46.462 --> 01:07:48.329
I live here.

01:07:50.833 --> 01:07:54.302
You said, "get ready."
I did.

01:07:55.704 --> 01:07:57.072
I am.

01:07:57.074 --> 01:07:59.207
You aren't.

01:07:59.209 --> 01:08:02.444
And I don't think
you are ever going to be.

01:08:02.446 --> 01:08:06.648
And I don't want anything
to happen to you.

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:11.119
I think
it's already happening.

01:08:37.712 --> 01:08:39.814
Wondered where you went.

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:43.952
I wanted a drink.

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.921
How's that going?

01:08:47.923 --> 01:08:50.125
Superb.

01:08:52.495 --> 01:08:55.029
Now, Keith.

01:08:55.031 --> 01:08:58.666
What?
Do you ever think

01:08:58.667 --> 01:09:00.868
that the future

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:04.639
is, like,
someplace you never been?

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:10.979
No. Not really.

01:09:10.981 --> 01:09:13.515
Like Sydney, Australia.

01:09:14.783 --> 01:09:17.484
You been around.

01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:22.090
Have you ever been
to Sydney, Australia?

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:24.325
I never have.

01:09:24.327 --> 01:09:26.027
Okay, good.

01:09:27.095 --> 01:09:28.563
Me neither.

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:31.533
But we wouldn't say
that it hasn't...

01:09:32.568 --> 01:09:34.368
Happened yet

01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:37.872
just because we haven't
been there, now, would we?

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:40.341
Of course not.

01:09:40.343 --> 01:09:42.810
We would say

01:09:43.812 --> 01:09:45.880
that it exists.

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:49.917
Agreed.

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:53.388
Well, maybe the future
is like that.

01:09:54.657 --> 01:09:56.791
It's there.

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:00.528
We're on our way.

01:10:02.765 --> 01:10:05.033
It exists, man.

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:08.536
Yep.

01:10:09.838 --> 01:10:11.239
Okay. No offense,

01:10:11.241 --> 01:10:13.074
but I'm cutting you off.

01:10:13.076 --> 01:10:15.443
Oh, that's okay.

01:10:15.445 --> 01:10:17.912
I understand.

01:10:17.914 --> 01:10:21.316
My god, I, of all people.

01:10:21.318 --> 01:10:25.086
So, Pierre, I meant to tell you,
guy called the station.

01:10:25.088 --> 01:10:27.088
Looks like you're getting
your harmonica back.

01:10:31.327 --> 01:10:33.027
What harmonica?

01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:51.606
Who is it?

01:11:51.608 --> 01:11:55.343
It's me. Let me in.

01:11:59.214 --> 01:12:01.382
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:12:03.819 --> 01:12:05.386
Where you been, man?

01:12:05.388 --> 01:12:07.355
Uh, nowhere.

01:12:07.357 --> 01:12:08.356
You wanna go to the play?

01:12:09.858 --> 01:12:12.226
Uh, the play's crummy.

01:12:12.228 --> 01:12:14.762
That's what I like about it.

01:12:14.764 --> 01:12:17.265
Come on.
We always go to the play.

01:12:19.268 --> 01:12:22.203
I think
I'm gonna skip it this time.

01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:25.506
All right.

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:33.681
Well, I guess I'll go
to the crummy play,

01:12:33.683 --> 01:12:35.750
all by myself.

01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:41.389
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:12:41.391 --> 01:12:42.857
If you're gonna be that way,
yeah.

01:12:42.859 --> 01:12:44.525
Fuck it.
Yeah.

01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:45.860
I'll go to the play
with you.

01:12:45.862 --> 01:12:47.995
Thanks, Pierre.
You're welcome.

01:12:47.997 --> 01:12:50.832
Hey, maybe this time
it'll be good, huh?

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:00.208
Over here.

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:10.651
- I don't know why I got this.
- It's so sticky.

01:13:11.754 --> 01:13:15.923
Uh, just keep it away
from me.

01:13:19.928 --> 01:13:21.863
Hey, Pierre.

01:13:21.865 --> 01:13:24.065
Do you see that guy
with the white hair?

01:13:24.067 --> 01:13:25.933
Look.

01:13:25.935 --> 01:13:28.403
That's Tim geer.

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:36.978
This is what people talk about
when they refer

01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:38.980
to having a good time.

01:13:41.517 --> 01:13:42.517
Are you?

01:13:43.886 --> 01:13:46.020
Am I what?

01:13:46.022 --> 01:13:48.022
Having a good time.

01:13:49.892 --> 01:13:51.426
Yeah.

01:13:52.694 --> 01:13:54.529
I'm on cloud nine.

01:14:00.035 --> 01:14:02.303
I just...

01:14:02.305 --> 01:14:05.373
Thought that life
was gonna be fun.

01:14:06.642 --> 01:14:09.110
That was really
my impression.

01:14:10.979 --> 01:14:12.647
It is fun.

01:14:14.383 --> 01:14:17.752
I mean,
it's not like adventureland.

01:14:19.655 --> 01:14:22.423
You get to write your poems.

01:14:23.826 --> 01:14:26.594
The leaves move.

01:14:27.896 --> 01:14:30.865
You get laid sometimes.

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:35.036
That's fun, isn't it?

01:14:37.172 --> 01:14:39.707
The leaves move?

01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:42.076
You know what I mean.

01:14:43.445 --> 01:14:46.914
Oh, joy.
The leaves are moving.

01:14:48.951 --> 01:14:50.218
I really believe that.

01:14:52.521 --> 01:14:53.521
I know you do.

01:15:05.033 --> 01:15:07.502
That's the latest model.

01:15:07.504 --> 01:15:11.038
I have one at this price.

01:15:12.941 --> 01:15:14.609
I'm not seeing a difference.

01:15:18.547 --> 01:15:21.015
Uh, no table service
tonight, gents,

01:15:21.017 --> 01:15:22.483
but you can order
at the bar if you like.

01:15:22.485 --> 01:15:24.852
Ah, good. Good.

01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:25.953
Is Pierre around?

01:15:25.955 --> 01:15:27.722
Uh, he's off tonight.

01:15:27.724 --> 01:15:30.591
Oh, that's too bad,
I'm an old friend of his.

01:15:30.593 --> 01:15:31.759
Oh, yeah? What's your name?

01:15:31.761 --> 01:15:33.127
Bobby.

01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:36.464
Don't remember him talking
about a Bobby.

01:15:36.466 --> 01:15:39.300
It has been too long.
You're right about that.

01:15:39.302 --> 01:15:40.902
I'm just passing
through town.

01:15:40.904 --> 01:15:43.070
I know he'd give me hell
if I didn't stop and see him.

01:15:43.072 --> 01:15:45.740
Well, were it me,
I'd check over to the play.

01:15:47.442 --> 01:15:48.442
What play?

01:15:48.444 --> 01:15:51.012
Well, I forget
what they call it,

01:15:51.014 --> 01:15:53.147
but it's for
bank robber days.

01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:57.251
Not much of a drama, frankly,
but very popular.

01:15:57.253 --> 01:15:58.753
Just go into town.

01:15:58.755 --> 01:16:00.254
That where it is?

01:16:00.256 --> 01:16:03.257
No. It's in the country,
but there's signs.

01:16:03.259 --> 01:16:05.126
It's a big production.

01:16:05.128 --> 01:16:08.629
You're wasting your time, boys,
Pierre's out of town.

01:16:08.631 --> 01:16:12.767
That's okay.
We like big productions.

01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:16.737
<i> I think I left my coat</i>
<i> in the bank.</i>

01:16:16.739 --> 01:16:18.940
I tell you what,
we get out of here,

01:16:18.942 --> 01:16:20.575
you can buy a coat store.

01:16:22.478 --> 01:16:24.278
I think my name was on it.

01:16:26.749 --> 01:16:28.616
You think what?

01:16:28.618 --> 01:16:30.751
Hey, we're in the play.

01:16:30.753 --> 01:16:32.053
Ma always used to write it

01:16:32.055 --> 01:16:33.054
yeah.

01:16:33.056 --> 01:16:34.188
Inside the collar.

01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:36.490
It's Keith.

01:16:36.492 --> 01:16:40.261
This is your problem,
and you've gotta figure it out.

01:16:40.263 --> 01:16:41.662
Yeah?

01:16:42.931 --> 01:16:45.066
Hang on. Hang on.

01:16:48.203 --> 01:16:49.837
Now, don't get so riled up.

01:16:51.006 --> 01:16:54.542
I told you,
don't push me around.

01:16:54.544 --> 01:16:55.776
We gotta keep it together.

01:16:55.778 --> 01:16:57.878
Huh.

01:17:06.521 --> 01:17:08.756
A whiskey, please.
Sure.

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:11.525
Thank you.

01:17:11.527 --> 01:17:12.893
Two ciders.

01:17:12.895 --> 01:17:14.195
Sure.

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:18.899
Thank you.

01:17:47.763 --> 01:17:49.163
Are these even legal?

01:17:52.634 --> 01:17:53.634
What do you want?

01:17:56.271 --> 01:17:57.371
My money.

01:17:57.373 --> 01:17:58.939
I don't have it.

01:17:58.941 --> 01:18:01.709
Well, I didn't figure
you had it on you.

01:18:01.711 --> 01:18:03.511
I buried it.

01:18:03.513 --> 01:18:07.381
We shall go to the place
where it is buried.

01:18:07.383 --> 01:18:09.183
Why would I?

01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:11.152
I don't see where you have
a lot of choice.

01:18:20.762 --> 01:18:23.064
You burn any houses lately?

01:18:23.066 --> 01:18:25.833
You don't know
anything about me.

01:18:28.136 --> 01:18:29.470
I know enough.

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:38.145
This the guy?

01:18:38.147 --> 01:18:40.147
He says he buried the money.

01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:42.216
That don't sound right.

01:18:42.218 --> 01:18:44.518
People don't bury
money anymore.

01:18:45.721 --> 01:18:48.723
It ain't at his place.
We know that much.

01:18:48.725 --> 01:18:50.725
You went into my apartment?

01:18:50.727 --> 01:18:53.194
Yeah, we did.

01:18:53.196 --> 01:18:55.262
Those are some nice
model boats too,

01:18:55.264 --> 01:18:57.598
but I have to say,
you're like a fucking child.

01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:00.501
They didn't hold up too well
when we leaned on them.

01:19:00.503 --> 01:19:01.969
Now, that was wrong.

01:19:01.971 --> 01:19:03.704
Shut up and get in the car.

01:19:04.774 --> 01:19:06.407
This is going well.

01:19:14.517 --> 01:19:16.817
Tell me,
where is my fucking money?

01:19:19.621 --> 01:19:22.690
It's in an orchard.

01:19:25.561 --> 01:19:28.395
Did he tell you what
this is about?

01:19:29.664 --> 01:19:33.868
He tried to steal
a rosebush,

01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:39.206
and for that,
he lost $77,000.

01:19:39.208 --> 01:19:40.407
That much?

01:19:40.409 --> 01:19:41.642
You didn't say it was that much.

01:19:41.644 --> 01:19:43.878
You believe this thief
over me?

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:45.112
We'll count it.

01:19:45.114 --> 01:19:48.182
You wanna count it,
be my guest.

01:19:48.184 --> 01:19:49.917
This is what's wrong
with you.

01:19:49.919 --> 01:19:51.685
You can count it,
recount it,

01:19:51.687 --> 01:19:54.054
count it together like
smart ladies in a bank.

01:19:54.056 --> 01:19:55.589
We just might do that.

01:19:55.591 --> 01:19:57.291
The cut is the cut
as discussed.

01:19:59.261 --> 01:20:01.829
Lyle's share

01:20:01.831 --> 01:20:02.963
comes out of your share.

01:20:02.965 --> 01:20:06.233
Let's not argue
in front of the boy.

01:20:13.942 --> 01:20:17.344
Of all the fucking places
to put money.

01:20:17.346 --> 01:20:19.513
You ever hear
of a safe-deposit box?

01:20:19.515 --> 01:20:22.349
No, I never did.

01:20:22.351 --> 01:20:25.519
You brought it up here
and you dug a hole?

01:20:25.521 --> 01:20:28.022
Yeah. What else?

01:20:28.024 --> 01:20:29.657
How do you know
people wouldn't find it?

01:20:29.659 --> 01:20:32.927
Or an animal that
smelled the scent of humans?

01:20:32.929 --> 01:20:36.363
Understand this, son.
I think you're a liar.

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:41.235
If that money ain't here,
and I don't care why--

01:20:41.237 --> 01:20:44.205
if the hole is empty
or you can't remember the spot

01:20:44.207 --> 01:20:47.842
or the possums fucking rose up
and ate the money

01:20:47.844 --> 01:20:49.109
whatever happen--

01:20:53.916 --> 01:20:55.850
what the--?

01:20:55.852 --> 01:20:57.051
Jesus.

01:21:07.963 --> 01:21:10.097
Oh, shit.

01:21:11.634 --> 01:21:12.867
- Where is he?
- God.

01:21:29.451 --> 01:21:32.219
It's happening right now
in the orchard.

01:21:34.022 --> 01:21:37.324
Best thing for you
is to stay right here.

01:22:25.874 --> 01:22:27.942
I've seen this episode.

01:22:27.944 --> 01:22:29.977
The outnumbered guy
kills everybody.

01:22:29.979 --> 01:22:31.045
Lyle, go around.

01:22:31.047 --> 01:22:32.913
Around what?
Around what?

01:22:32.915 --> 01:22:34.148
The building, for chrissake.

01:22:34.150 --> 01:22:37.718
Why would I do that?
To see if he's there.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:39.653
Do you see him?
You fucked this up.

01:22:39.655 --> 01:22:41.555
I don't know
why you brought him.

01:22:41.557 --> 01:22:42.623
Backup.

01:22:42.625 --> 01:22:44.124
Are you gonna go around
this shed

01:22:44.126 --> 01:22:46.360
or do I have to throw you
around the shed?

01:22:46.362 --> 01:22:49.129
Go on.
Yeah, okay. I'll go.

01:22:49.131 --> 01:22:50.531
Good,
and give me the flashlight.

01:22:50.533 --> 01:22:51.799
I need it.

01:22:51.801 --> 01:22:53.300
Think.

01:22:53.302 --> 01:22:55.302
What is a flashlight,
but a big bright target?

01:22:55.304 --> 01:22:57.237
Think, Lyle.

01:23:10.185 --> 01:23:11.785
What, you think
the money's here?

01:23:11.787 --> 01:23:13.020
I doubt it.

01:23:14.022 --> 01:23:15.422
Seems like
he had it thought out.

01:23:15.424 --> 01:23:17.124
So let's leave.

01:23:17.126 --> 01:23:19.326
Car's all mangled.
Yeah. Well, it's insured.

01:23:19.328 --> 01:23:20.761
We'll ditch it
and get another one.

01:23:20.763 --> 01:23:22.629
You go.

01:23:22.631 --> 01:23:25.099
Won't be able to hold
my head up, I go back now.

01:23:25.101 --> 01:23:26.166
I don't find him.

01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:28.168
You know why?

01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:29.370
Because you let him
get away.

01:23:29.372 --> 01:23:30.671
Yeah, right. I see.

01:23:30.673 --> 01:23:32.239
And you driving your car

01:23:32.241 --> 01:23:34.508
into a hole in the ground
had nothing to do with that?

01:23:38.947 --> 01:23:41.482
Now I've seen it all.

01:23:44.519 --> 01:23:46.120
Oh, you're not hurt.

01:23:46.122 --> 01:23:47.187
Keep it down.

01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:50.324
Not hurt? You shot him
in the fucking heart.

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:01.902
I think

01:24:01.904 --> 01:24:03.270
I wanna go.

01:24:03.272 --> 01:24:05.072
That's fine.

01:24:05.074 --> 01:24:07.041
I do the work.

01:24:08.043 --> 01:24:09.543
Like St. ivo,
i killed the woman,

01:24:09.545 --> 01:24:11.979
you handled the phones.

01:24:11.981 --> 01:24:15.149
Kid's got a 12-Gauge.

01:24:15.151 --> 01:24:17.051
You taking the car?

01:24:17.053 --> 01:24:20.721
Yeah. I guess
I'll give it a try.

01:24:20.723 --> 01:24:23.190
Yeah, that'll probably work.

01:25:16.244 --> 01:25:17.845
Shit.

01:25:37.866 --> 01:25:40.167
Did you burn the house?

01:25:41.769 --> 01:25:43.971
Do you have anything
to drink?

01:25:45.039 --> 01:25:46.640
No.

01:25:46.642 --> 01:25:47.708
Did you?

01:25:49.444 --> 01:25:51.545
I didn't know
you were there.

01:25:52.614 --> 01:25:55.149
Bad luck all around.

01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:01.522
You're all full of light.

01:26:03.958 --> 01:26:05.959
That's not me.

01:26:05.961 --> 01:26:07.394
That's you.

01:26:08.463 --> 01:26:10.030
It is?

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:14.067
Where's Pierre?

01:26:15.103 --> 01:26:17.571
He's around here somewhere.

01:27:07.455 --> 01:27:09.656
A friend of Pierre's told me

01:27:09.658 --> 01:27:12.859
that in one of their
last conversations

01:27:12.861 --> 01:27:18.165
he expressed the opinion
that living is fun.

01:27:18.167 --> 01:27:23.604
More specifically, Pierre said
that he found it fun

01:27:23.606 --> 01:27:27.174
when leaves move.

01:27:27.176 --> 01:27:30.911
Perhaps what he meant is
that this planet and the lives

01:27:30.913 --> 01:27:32.846
that we have been given
are opportunities

01:27:32.848 --> 01:27:36.817
that we do not comprehend.

01:27:36.819 --> 01:27:42.189
And so we misuse them
day by day.

01:27:44.459 --> 01:27:46.827
<i> We look around in space,</i>

01:27:46.829 --> 01:27:49.296
<i> and what do we see?</i>

01:27:49.298 --> 01:27:50.664
<i> Nothing.</i>

01:27:50.666 --> 01:27:53.834
<i> No leaves, no life</i>

01:27:53.836 --> 01:27:56.536
<i> for who knows how far.</i>

01:27:56.538 --> 01:28:02.276
<i> And here we are now.</i>

01:28:02.278 --> 01:28:05.812
<i> Are we doing the best we can</i>
<i> for each other?</i>

01:28:05.814 --> 01:28:08.582
<i> For ourselves?</i>

01:28:08.584 --> 01:28:14.454
<i> Or can we find it in us</i>
<i> to be more than we have been?</i>

01:28:17.792 --> 01:28:19.526
Carrie?

01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:25.198
I think we're gonna need
to come back on the weekend.

01:28:28.603 --> 01:28:30.504
You want a glass of water?

01:28:30.506 --> 01:28:33.173
Sure. Yeah.

01:29:11.780 --> 01:29:15.315
<i> Everything that succeeds</i>
<i> creates the conditions</i>

01:29:15.317 --> 01:29:17.250
<i> for its own demise.</i>

01:29:17.252 --> 01:29:18.885
<i> Like a fire.</i>

01:29:18.887 --> 01:29:22.989
<i>It burns the fuel that feeds it</i>
<i> and goes out.</i>

01:29:22.991 --> 01:29:26.460
<i> Supposedly, this will</i>
<i> even happen to the sun.</i>

01:29:26.462 --> 01:29:29.096
<i> This seemed to be</i>
<i>the only philosophy Pierre had,</i>

01:29:30.665 --> 01:29:34.634
<i> although I'm not sure</i>
<i> it was a philosophy.</i>

01:29:35.770 --> 01:29:37.571
<i> It meant</i>
<i> that nothing sufficiently good</i>

01:29:37.573 --> 01:29:39.306
<i> or bad can last.</i>

01:29:39.308 --> 01:29:41.241
<i> The only things</i>
<i> that might last</i>

01:29:41.243 --> 01:29:43.143
<i> are the things</i>
<i> that make no difference.</i>

01:29:45.446 --> 01:29:46.947
<i> But I'm not sure I agree.</i>

01:29:46.949 --> 01:29:49.349
<i> If the stars go out</i>

01:29:49.351 --> 01:29:52.552
<i> and the universe collapses in</i>
<i> on itself,</i>

01:29:52.554 --> 01:29:55.288
<i> won't it all begin again?</i>

01:30:00.161 --> 01:30:01.762
I didn't mean to wake you.

01:30:10.204 --> 01:30:11.438
What time is it?

01:30:13.307 --> 01:30:14.941
Not late.

01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:19.746
I'm walking into town
if you're going that way.

01:30:22.417 --> 01:30:25.051
I laid down in the grass.

01:30:25.053 --> 01:30:27.554
That's the last thing
i remember.

01:30:27.556 --> 01:30:30.357
Well, it's a beautiful day.

01:30:30.359 --> 01:30:32.926
It's supposed to stay that way
for a while.

01:30:32.928 --> 01:30:35.128
Yeah.

01:30:37.298 --> 01:30:39.199
<i> What brings you here?</i>

01:30:39.201 --> 01:30:41.401
<i> That's a good question.</i>

01:30:42.503 --> 01:30:43.637
But we have time.
