[OWL] Hoo, hoo, hoo!

01:56.000 --> 02:00.167
[engine revving]

02:01.375 --> 02:03.875
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball,

02:03.959 --> 02:07.000
Goku and Bulma decided
to team up and search for

02:07.084 --> 02:09.875
the remaining four
Dragon Balls together.

02:09.959 --> 02:11.375
The adventure continues

02:11.459 --> 02:15.500
as they speed head-
long into the unknown.

02:15.584 --> 02:16.292
[GOKU] Bulma, stop!

02:16.375 --> 02:17.875
I just saw a snake.

02:17.959 --> 02:19.875
That oughta tide us
over until dinner.

02:19.959 --> 02:21.500
That is so
disgusting, Goku!

02:21.584 --> 02:23.125
If you don't wanna gross
people out, you're gonna

02:23.209 --> 02:25.750
have to stop eating frogs
and snakes and things.

02:25.834 --> 02:26.542
[GOKU] Really?

02:26.625 --> 02:28.000
[BULMA] Mm-hm.

02:28.625 --> 02:29.959
How about lizards?

02:30.042 --> 02:32.375
[BULMA] Nope, eating
lizards is nasty too, kid.

02:32.459 --> 02:33.625
You're just going
to have to toughen up.

02:40.167 --> 02:41.209
[GOKU] Yeah!

02:41.292 --> 02:42.625
This looks like a
good place to camp!

02:42.709 --> 02:44.667
[BULMA] There's no need to
live outside like savages.

02:44.750 --> 02:46.750
I have my Dyno-caps, remember?

02:46.834 --> 02:48.334
[GOKU] Huh?

02:48.417 --> 02:49.917
Don't tell me you have a tent
in one of those things, Bulma?

02:50.000 --> 02:51.750
Well, no, not exactly.

02:51.834 --> 02:53.917
[GOKU] I don't like
those magic witch-bombs.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.917
Grandpa said never to use magic
unless it's to help someone.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.875
[BULMA] Oh, well I am
going to help someone, silly.

03:01.167 --> 03:02.959
She's pretty and has blue hair.

03:03.542 --> 03:04.542
[BULMA] What's the matter?

03:04.625 --> 03:05.584
You're not afraid, are you?

03:07.667 --> 03:08.625
[BULMA] Here it goes!

03:13.834 --> 03:14.792
[GOKU] Huh?

03:16.084 --> 03:18.250
[BULMA] There we go! Now
doesn't that look cozy?

03:18.334 --> 03:20.334
Come on, Goku.
What are you waiting for?

03:20.667 --> 03:22.500
[GOKU] Uhhh...

03:22.584 --> 03:24.542
[GOKU] Get away
from its mouth, Bulma!

03:24.625 --> 03:26.375
I'll protect you
from this monster!

03:26.459 --> 03:29.500
[BULMA] Thanks, that's noble
of you, but it's just a house.

03:29.584 --> 03:30.542
See?

03:32.875 --> 03:34.125
[GOKU] Bulma!

03:34.209 --> 03:36.042
You made it light, but it's
still dark outside!

03:36.125 --> 03:37.292
[BULMA] Chill out.

03:37.375 --> 03:39.084
It's a little something
we call "electricity".

03:39.167 --> 03:42.000
Were you transported from
the stone age or what?

03:42.084 --> 03:43.250
[GOKU] Huh?

03:43.334 --> 03:45.542
Oh, wow!

03:45.625 --> 03:47.209
This is amazing!

03:51.084 --> 03:54.834
[guitar playing]

03:54.917 --> 03:55.875
Goku...

03:57.084 --> 03:58.834
Oh, no, that guy's
trapped and he's trying

03:58.917 --> 04:01.542
to break the glass by
playing that horrible music!

04:02.834 --> 04:04.500
[MAN] Lilah, I love you.

04:04.584 --> 04:06.375
[LILAH] Kiss me, you fool.

04:07.584 --> 04:08.417
[LILAH] Oh, Chad!

04:08.500 --> 04:10.292
I've waited so long for this!

04:11.209 --> 04:13.000
[CHAD] I'll love you
forever, my darling!

04:16.084 --> 04:17.166
[GOKU] What's this thing?

04:17.250 --> 04:19.041
[BULMA] One little
kiss... One kiss...

04:21.916 --> 04:23.834
[BULMA] Yes! Almost there!

04:23.917 --> 04:24.959
[monster screeching]

04:25.042 --> 04:28.000
[BULMA screaming]

04:28.084 --> 04:29.667
[GOKU laughing]

04:29.750 --> 04:31.459
[BULMA] You shut up!

04:31.542 --> 04:32.875
[GOKU] Hey, are you
getting hungry, Bulma?

04:32.959 --> 04:34.084
[BULMA] Huh?

04:34.167 --> 04:36.167
[GOKU] Well, you're drooling.

04:36.250 --> 04:38.709
[BULMA] Now I'm embarrassed!

04:38.792 --> 04:41.500
Hey, what's that
horrible smell?

04:41.584 --> 04:44.042
Ugh, Goku, you need a bath!

04:44.125 --> 04:45.917
[GOKU] Uhhh...

04:46.000 --> 04:47.667
what's a bath?

04:47.750 --> 04:48.542
[BULMA] Oh, kid!

04:48.625 --> 04:51.000
I can't believe you're asking!

04:51.084 --> 04:52.875
I guess I gotta show you...

04:55.584 --> 04:58.334
[BULMA] We civilized
people call that a "towel"!

04:58.417 --> 04:59.834
Now let's get this over with!

04:59.917 --> 05:00.875
Hop in!

05:02.125 --> 05:03.042
[GOKU] Hmm...

05:03.125 --> 05:04.250
So this is a bath?

05:04.334 --> 05:05.459
[BULMA] Look at you!

05:05.542 --> 05:07.167
You're supposed to
cover up the front!

05:07.250 --> 05:07.875
[GOKU] Hm?

05:07.959 --> 05:08.917
Like this?

05:12.459 --> 05:14.917
[GOKU] Why are you putting
this fluffy stuff in my hair?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.167
[BULMA] It's called shampoo.

05:16.250 --> 05:17.959
And I'm putting it in
your hair to clean it.

05:18.042 --> 05:19.917
I don't do this
very often, you know.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.875
You should consider
yourself lucky!

05:21.959 --> 05:23.250
[BULMA] No wonder your
hair stands up,

05:23.334 --> 05:24.667
it's never been washed.

05:24.750 --> 05:26.959
There, that's better. Yeah!

05:27.334 --> 05:28.584
What in the world?!

05:28.667 --> 05:30.875
Whoa! How does
this thing stay on, kid?

05:30.959 --> 05:32.709
I thought it was
attached to your pants!

05:32.792 --> 05:34.584
What do you do,
super-glue it to your butt?

05:35.500 --> 05:36.292
[GOKU] Ow!

05:36.375 --> 05:37.792
What are you doing?! That hurts!

05:37.875 --> 05:39.209
[BULMA] I'm trying
to take this thing off

05:39.292 --> 05:40.792
so I can wash
your back properly.

05:40.875 --> 05:42.167
[GOKU] Here, that's okay.

05:42.250 --> 05:43.834
I can wash my own back.

05:45.709 --> 05:46.667
Huh?

05:47.917 --> 05:49.709
[GOKU] See? It's easy!

05:50.667 --> 05:52.167
[whimpering]

05:52.250 --> 05:54.875
[BULMA screaming]

05:57.209 --> 05:58.250
No way!

05:58.334 --> 06:00.209
It moves!

06:00.292 --> 06:03.959
[BULMA] That means
it's... it's real!

06:04.042 --> 06:07.000
Goku, uh, why do you
have a tail growing?

06:07.084 --> 06:08.542
Well, I don't
really know why.

06:08.625 --> 06:10.125
I just know that
all boys have 'em.

06:10.209 --> 06:12.542
It's no big deal, it's
just the way we are.

06:12.625 --> 06:13.750
Huh?

06:13.834 --> 06:15.125
[BULMA] Maybe he's right.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.500
I've never actually
seen a boy take a bath

06:17.584 --> 06:19.334
before so I guess
I can't be sure.

06:19.417 --> 06:22.042
Maybe they just keep them tucked
in their pants or something.

06:22.125 --> 06:23.834
How bizarre!

06:23.917 --> 06:25.125
I can't believe
I'm a teenager

06:25.209 --> 06:26.834
and I'm just now finding out.

06:26.917 --> 06:28.750
Well, I guess I
shoudn't say all boys,

06:28.834 --> 06:30.542
because my Grandpa
didn't have a tail.

06:30.625 --> 06:32.125
See? See?

06:32.209 --> 06:34.750
Normal men don't have tails or
your grandpa would've had one!

06:34.834 --> 06:37.584
But my Grandpa was a
very odd fellow, you know!

06:37.667 --> 06:39.375
You're the
real odd ball!

06:39.459 --> 06:42.125
So that was
a bath, huh?

06:42.209 --> 06:44.000
A bath sounds
so wonderful.

06:48.667 --> 06:51.250
[BULMA] Aah, there's nothing
like a long hot bath

06:51.334 --> 06:53.542
to melt a woman's cares
away, that's for sure!

06:55.084 --> 06:56.042
[BULMA] Mmm!

06:57.584 --> 06:58.542
Hm?

06:59.875 --> 07:01.834
[screaming]

07:05.250 --> 07:06.334
What are you doing?!

07:06.417 --> 07:08.292
Can't you see that
I'm taking a bath, kid?!

07:08.375 --> 07:10.500
Yeah. I was going to
help you scrub your back.

07:10.584 --> 07:12.375
You know, since you
don't have a tail.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.167
No way, I can
scrub my own back!

07:15.250 --> 07:16.792
Now beat it! Shoo, shoo!

07:16.875 --> 07:18.625
Gosh, I don't
get it, Bulma.

07:18.709 --> 07:20.792
You were going to
help me scrub my back.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.125
[BULMA] Goku,
you're a little kid

07:22.209 --> 07:23.542
and I'm practically
a full-grown woman!

07:23.625 --> 07:24.625
There's a big difference!

07:24.709 --> 07:25.834
There is?

07:25.917 --> 07:27.417
[BULMA] Yes, there certainly is!

07:27.500 --> 07:29.834
But we're not going to
get into that right now...

07:29.917 --> 07:32.834
Hey, you don't have
to be ashamed, no way.

07:32.917 --> 07:34.625
What in the world
are you talking about?

07:34.709 --> 07:35.709
I happen to be one of the most

07:35.792 --> 07:37.167
beautiful girls
that you'll ever see!

07:37.250 --> 07:40.042
So what do I have to
be ashamed of, buster?

07:40.125 --> 07:41.334
[GOKU] Not having a tail?

07:41.417 --> 07:43.625
That's it, get
out of my face.

07:44.750 --> 07:45.917
But I want to help.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.334
Beat it!

07:47.417 --> 07:49.209
Oh, come on.

07:52.292 --> 07:53.750
[BULMA] I can't take it anymore!

07:53.834 --> 07:56.125
Get out of my
bathroom and stay out!

07:56.209 --> 08:00.084
And for the last time,
I don't want a stupid tail!

08:00.167 --> 08:01.959
Uhhh!

08:02.750 --> 08:05.250
It's about time I got
a little bit of privacy.

08:05.334 --> 08:07.250
[GOKU] Bulma.

08:07.334 --> 08:09.084
I'm hungry.

08:09.167 --> 08:10.959
[BULMA] Goku!

08:15.792 --> 08:18.584
[PILAF] Well, did you bring
me a Dragon Ball, Shu?

08:18.667 --> 08:19.625
[SHU] No, sire.

08:19.709 --> 08:21.792
I-I got real hungry
so I came back.

08:21.875 --> 08:23.667
[PILAF] Imbecile! You won't
get so much as a bone

08:23.750 --> 08:25.584
until you bring
me another Dragon Ball!

08:25.667 --> 08:27.209
[SHU] But, sire!

08:27.292 --> 08:29.125
I'm so hungry that
I can't even think!

08:29.209 --> 08:30.834
[PILAF] That's a
good thing, Shu.

08:30.917 --> 08:32.500
You'll have to trust me on that.

08:32.583 --> 08:34.375
[burps]

08:35.167 --> 08:37.875
[PILAF] Ahh, look how it
sparkles so brilliantly!

08:37.958 --> 08:39.875
And yet it's only
one piece to the puzzle!

08:39.958 --> 08:42.000
I have to have those
other six Dragon Balls!

08:42.792 --> 08:44.709
[SHU] But why, sire?

08:44.792 --> 08:45.834
Isn't one enough?

08:45.917 --> 08:47.709
Of course one
isn't enough!

08:48.375 --> 08:50.292
If I pulled out all of
your teeth except one,

08:50.375 --> 08:52.375
would that one be
enough to chew with?! No!

08:53.792 --> 08:55.625
[PILAF] If I cut off all
of your paws except one,

08:55.709 --> 08:58.084
would that one be
enough to run with?! No!

08:58.584 --> 08:59.792
Do you see my
point now, Shu?

08:59.875 --> 09:01.375
I can't rule the
world with one ball!

09:01.459 --> 09:03.125
Can you understand that?!

09:03.209 --> 09:04.625
Yes, I think so!

09:04.709 --> 09:06.292
But isn't the world
an awfully big place?

09:06.375 --> 09:07.959
How can one person
rule the whole thing?

09:08.042 --> 09:10.667
Well, you have to be
able to delegate, Shu,

09:10.750 --> 09:13.000
and I've always been good at
telling other people what to do.

09:13.084 --> 09:15.709
Bossing people around is
one of my strong points.

09:15.792 --> 09:18.167
Right! That's true, sire!

09:18.250 --> 09:20.250
[PILAF] There are
other requirements, Shu!

09:20.334 --> 09:23.625
You have to be able to
think big! Not small, big!

09:23.709 --> 09:26.459
And though small in
stature, I think very big!

09:26.542 --> 09:28.917
I have all the qualities
needed to rule the world!

09:29.000 --> 09:31.792
What I don't have are
those other six Dragon Balls!

09:31.875 --> 09:32.834
You dolt!

09:33.250 --> 09:34.459
[PILAF wailing]

09:34.542 --> 09:36.750
[PILAF farts]

09:36.834 --> 09:37.750
[SHU] Uh, oh!

09:37.834 --> 09:40.959
[chuckles]

09:41.042 --> 09:43.584
Heh, heh!

09:43.667 --> 09:44.875
Did you hear that?

09:44.959 --> 09:45.917
Huh?!

09:46.834 --> 09:48.667
I think you did...

09:48.750 --> 09:50.042
No, Sire! It wasn't me!

09:50.125 --> 09:51.084
I swear!

09:52.500 --> 09:54.375
[PILAF] We'll see about that!

09:54.459 --> 09:55.375
[SHU] Huh?

09:56.625 --> 09:58.417
[PILAF] Ha-Ha! Ha ha ha!

10:04.042 --> 10:05.792
Note to me:
I must remember

10:05.875 --> 10:07.834
to move that button
to a closer spot!

10:07.917 --> 10:09.209
Please let me go, sire!

10:09.292 --> 10:10.917
I didn't do anything!

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Are you saying
that I would be capable

10:13.084 --> 10:14.709
of such a gross emission?

10:14.792 --> 10:16.417
[SHU] Oh, no! Please, sire!

10:16.500 --> 10:18.375
I'll not tolerate
this kind of outburst

10:18.459 --> 10:19.875
from one of my agents!

10:19.959 --> 10:22.542
I'm afraid the time has
come to trim the staff a bit!

10:28.292 --> 10:29.792
Don't chop me up!

10:29.875 --> 10:32.375
I admit it, sire! I did it! I
tooted, I farted, I passed gas!

10:32.459 --> 10:34.834
Guilty as charged,
woo-hoo! Let out a stinker!

10:37.125 --> 10:38.250
That's better.

10:38.334 --> 10:39.792
I'll let this one go
because you were honest.

10:39.875 --> 10:41.584
Just make sure it
doesn't happen again!

10:41.667 --> 10:43.292
Is that clear, Shu?!

10:43.375 --> 10:45.709
[SHU] Yes, sire!
I'll try to contain myself!

10:45.792 --> 10:46.917
[WOMAN] Emperor Pilaf!

10:47.000 --> 10:48.792
That sounded like Agent Mai.

10:53.875 --> 10:56.292
Sire, Agent Mai
reporting as ordered.

10:57.209 --> 10:58.959
[PILAF] Hmm, well,
what's the news?

10:59.042 --> 11:01.167
Did you bring me back
another Dragon Ball?

11:01.250 --> 11:02.334
[MAI] No, Sire,

11:02.417 --> 11:04.334
But I do have some
valuable information.

11:04.417 --> 11:06.750
Is it about the
Dragon Balls? Well?!

11:06.834 --> 11:07.792
Yes.

11:10.417 --> 11:12.417
[MAI] A deep-cover
agent of ours landed

11:12.500 --> 11:14.667
in a place known
as Skull Valley.

11:14.750 --> 11:16.500
Just before he
left his spy-plane,

11:16.584 --> 11:19.459
he reported seeing a mysterious
light with a bright glow.

11:19.542 --> 11:22.417
[PILAF] Was the
light a Dragon Ball?

11:22.500 --> 11:23.667
[MAI] We don't know, sire.

11:23.750 --> 11:24.959
He disappeared!

11:25.042 --> 11:26.834
We never heard from him again!

11:27.667 --> 11:29.750
Hmm, take Shu with you

11:29.834 --> 11:31.917
and see if there's a
Dragon Ball over there.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.834
Sire! I have
obedience school today!

11:34.917 --> 11:36.459
Nevermind that!

11:36.542 --> 11:39.792
We need a disposable agent
like you on this mission, Shu!

11:39.875 --> 11:41.875
Now go get me a Dragon Ball!

11:41.959 --> 11:43.750
--Yes, sir!
--Yes, sire...

11:47.459 --> 11:49.250
So this is it, huh?

11:50.834 --> 11:51.834
Eww, yuck!

11:51.917 --> 11:53.417
This bread stuff
doesn't have any flavor!

11:53.500 --> 11:54.917
And my soup's bitter too!

11:55.000 --> 11:56.459
[BULMA] That's not
soup, it's coffee!

11:56.542 --> 11:58.500
And how do you expect
to grow big and strong

11:58.584 --> 11:59.959
if you don't eat right!

12:01.042 --> 12:02.042
You know you're right!

12:02.125 --> 12:03.917
Thanks for the advice, Bulma!

12:05.209 --> 12:06.000
Huh?!

12:06.084 --> 12:07.792
Where do you think you're going?

12:10.709 --> 12:12.000
[GOKU] I'm going
to go get some food

12:12.084 --> 12:13.084
that will make
me big and strong!

12:13.167 --> 12:14.334
I'll bring some back!

12:14.417 --> 12:15.875
[BULMA] You might wind
up being food yourself

12:15.959 --> 12:17.459
if you're not careful out there!

12:17.542 --> 12:18.709
I wouldn't do it!

12:30.625 --> 12:33.625
[wolf howling]

12:43.209 --> 12:43.834
Wow.

12:43.917 --> 12:45.417
Slim pickings so far.

12:45.500 --> 12:48.000
Bulma can probably eat this
whole centipede by herself!

12:48.084 --> 12:50.792
I'm going to have
to do better than that.

12:50.875 --> 12:52.667
[GOKU] Hm?

12:54.167 --> 12:55.000
A bird!

12:55.084 --> 12:56.459
Wow!

12:58.500 --> 12:59.334
[MAI] There's Skull Valley.

12:59.417 --> 13:00.709
It's right below us.

13:00.792 --> 13:02.750
Can we go back now and
just say that we went?

13:02.834 --> 13:04.625
[MAI] Nah, we better
check it out.

13:17.625 --> 13:18.542
[SHU] Geronimo!

13:18.625 --> 13:20.542
[MAI] Shu! Be quiet.

13:20.625 --> 13:21.334
[SHU] Sorry.

13:21.417 --> 13:22.792
[MAI] Come on.

13:24.250 --> 13:25.625
[MAI squealing]

13:27.459 --> 13:31.542
[SHU] I want to chew on one of
these bones, but I'm too scared!

13:31.625 --> 13:33.834
[MAI] Let's just make sure
we leave with our own bones.

13:33.917 --> 13:35.709
[SHU] Yeah.

13:37.209 --> 13:39.667
[MAI and SHU] Huh?!

13:39.750 --> 13:40.750
What is that?!

13:40.834 --> 13:42.459
I don't know. It
could be a Dragon Ball.

13:42.542 --> 13:43.917
Let's check it out.

13:44.667 --> 13:50.375
[SHU whimpering]

13:50.459 --> 13:52.250
[MAI and SHU] Huh?

13:56.250 --> 13:57.042
The kid likes to jump!

13:57.125 --> 13:58.250
He's a hopper alright!

13:58.334 --> 14:00.542
Beat it, kid,
before you get hurt!

14:00.625 --> 14:01.625
You beat it!

14:01.709 --> 14:02.792
Look, I'm not going anywhere!

14:02.875 --> 14:04.292
That's my big birdy!

14:04.375 --> 14:07.000
I saw it first, so
you two just stay away!

14:07.084 --> 14:08.417
What in the world
is he talking about?

14:08.500 --> 14:09.625
Beats me.

14:09.709 --> 14:11.500
Kid, I think I hear
your mommy calling.

14:13.334 --> 14:15.167
[MAI and SHU] Huh?!

14:20.375 --> 14:23.250
[SHU] Those lights
weren't Dragon Balls!

14:23.334 --> 14:24.750
[MAI] No kidding!

14:24.834 --> 14:26.500
[GOKU] This is great! Now
there's enough for all of us!

14:26.584 --> 14:29.459
Ahh! Alright! Yum!

14:29.542 --> 14:30.667
[wolves snarling]

14:30.750 --> 14:33.709
[screaming]

14:36.125 --> 14:37.917
[blows landing]

14:38.000 --> 14:39.917
[GOKU laughing]

14:40.000 --> 14:42.667
[blows landing]

14:42.750 --> 14:45.625
[screaming]

14:45.709 --> 14:47.292
[SHU] This is it, Mai!

14:47.375 --> 14:49.959
[blows landing]

14:52.084 --> 14:53.875
That was close!

14:59.459 --> 15:00.334
[GOKU] Hm?!

15:00.417 --> 15:02.209
Hey, my bird! It's getting away!

15:09.875 --> 15:11.667
Power Pole, extend!

15:30.959 --> 15:33.542
Dog-gone it. This
bird's rock hard.

15:35.750 --> 15:38.750
[whimpering]

15:39.792 --> 15:41.209
[GOKU] Bulma, I'm back!

15:41.292 --> 15:44.084
[BULMA] Huh, he's alive after
all. Well, I'll be darned.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.084
Hm?

15:47.167 --> 15:49.084
If you think this
appetizer looks good,

15:49.167 --> 15:51.084
take a look at the main course!

15:51.167 --> 15:52.250
[whimpering]

15:52.334 --> 15:53.500
[screaming]

15:54.584 --> 15:56.375
[GOKU] Huh? Bulma?

15:58.500 --> 16:00.584
Bulma, are you
serious about not eating?

16:00.667 --> 16:02.125
This is looking pretty good!

16:02.209 --> 16:03.375
[BULMA] You're
grossing me out, Goku!

16:03.459 --> 16:05.375
I can't believe
you're gonna eat that!

16:05.459 --> 16:07.459
[chomping]

16:07.542 --> 16:08.667
[GOKU burping]

16:08.750 --> 16:10.334
[BULMA] Oh, my gosh!
That is so disgusting!

16:10.417 --> 16:12.000
You need to brush
your teeth, kid!

16:12.084 --> 16:13.542
[GOKU] Huh?

16:13.625 --> 16:15.125
[BULMA] I don't want to smell
your nasty ol' wolf-breath!

16:15.209 --> 16:17.125
Wow! What a soft bed!

16:17.209 --> 16:18.500
I could bounce
like this all night!

16:18.584 --> 16:21.209
Come on, Bulma,
there's room for both of us!

16:21.292 --> 16:23.709
Room? What are you
talking about, kid?

16:23.792 --> 16:25.584
We're not sleeping together.
You're sleeping on the floor.

16:27.625 --> 16:28.750
Are you serious?

16:28.834 --> 16:29.834
[BULMA] Yes!

16:29.917 --> 16:31.042
You're used to
roughing it, aren't you?

16:31.125 --> 16:32.792
A guy who eats
centipedes shouldn't mind

16:32.875 --> 16:34.375
sleeping on the floor.

16:34.459 --> 16:36.375
I don't mind, but I
hope it's not because

16:36.459 --> 16:38.125
you're still mad
about not having a tail.

16:38.209 --> 16:39.584
Get it through
your thick head:

16:39.667 --> 16:41.250
I don't want a tail!

16:43.584 --> 16:45.209
[BULMA] There we go.

16:45.292 --> 16:46.500
[BULMA] Hey...Goku...

16:46.584 --> 16:48.500
why did you live with
your grandpa anyway?

16:48.584 --> 16:50.709
I mean, what
happened to your parents?

16:50.792 --> 16:52.292
I'm not sure
what happened.

16:52.375 --> 16:54.334
My Grandpa found me
on a mountainside on a

16:54.417 --> 16:56.000
little bed of moss
when I was just a baby

16:56.084 --> 16:57.875
so he picked me
up and took me home.

16:59.542 --> 17:01.334
[BULMA] Did you know that
you don't have to keep a tail

17:01.417 --> 17:03.209
just because
you're born with one?

17:03.292 --> 17:05.166
Some dogs actually
get their tails cut off

17:05.250 --> 17:06.666
while they're still small.

17:06.750 --> 17:08.750
You shouldn't have let
them do that to you, Bulma.

17:08.834 --> 17:09.834
You're no dog.

17:09.916 --> 17:11.584
I'm not talking
about me, lame-brain!

17:11.666 --> 17:12.791
I never had a tail! Hm?!

17:12.875 --> 17:17.041
[GOKU snoring]

17:17.125 --> 17:18.916
I don't know what
planet this kid's from,

17:19.000 --> 17:20.084
but it's not Earth!

17:20.166 --> 17:22.166
[wolves howling]

17:25.250 --> 17:27.209
[birds chirping]

17:31.417 --> 17:33.292
I'm up...

17:33.375 --> 17:38.000
[yawning]

17:38.084 --> 17:39.875
[GOKU] I guess it's not
time to get up yet...

17:40.584 --> 17:43.584
Ha! See! I told her there
was enough room for both of us!

17:50.084 --> 17:51.834
[smacking]

17:51.917 --> 17:56.959
[GOKU] Hm? Strange...It feels
like there's nothing ther--

17:57.792 --> 18:00.875
[GOKU screaming]

18:00.959 --> 18:04.959
Huh?! Wha--Wha--?!

18:05.042 --> 18:07.667
I-It's your balls,
Bulma! They're gone!

18:07.750 --> 18:10.042
What?! You're
kidding me?! How?!

18:10.125 --> 18:12.334
--[GOKU] U-uh, I don't know!
--[BULMA] Please, no!

18:13.917 --> 18:16.375
Thank goodness!
They're all here, Goku.

18:16.459 --> 18:18.834
You must have been dreaming.
Man, you really had me scared.

18:20.750 --> 18:22.709
[moaning]

18:27.250 --> 18:31.500
My gosh, Bulma. Wow, how
long is this going to take?

18:31.584 --> 18:33.875
Look, nobody asked
for your commentary!

18:33.959 --> 18:35.917
Besides, you didn't have to
wake us up at this insane hour!

18:37.667 --> 18:40.875
Early birds! You can
have your nasty, old worm.

18:40.959 --> 18:42.709
[GOKU] Well, you're moving
so slow I wouldn't be surprised

18:42.792 --> 18:44.792
if you turned into a turtle.

18:44.875 --> 18:46.375
[BULMA] Goku, you
can go out in public

18:46.459 --> 18:48.084
with your hair sticking out in
every direction if you want to,

18:48.167 --> 18:49.334
but not me.

18:51.084 --> 18:52.584
Would you like to
have coffee with me?

18:52.667 --> 18:54.959
Nah, it doesn't taste good
and it makes me feel funny!

18:55.042 --> 18:56.834
[GOKU] I'm gonna go exercise!

18:58.167 --> 18:59.959
[GOKU] Mm!

19:00.375 --> 19:04.334
[growling]

19:07.000 --> 19:19.209
[grunting]

19:19.292 --> 19:22.250
[crashing]

19:25.000 --> 19:25.959
[GOKU] Hmm!

19:28.625 --> 19:32.000
[growling]

19:32.084 --> 19:33.209
[grunting]

19:33.292 --> 19:34.834
Whoa!

19:34.917 --> 19:36.292
[GOKU] What in the world?!

19:38.417 --> 19:40.709
Ow, that's a new pain...

19:40.792 --> 19:43.792
Bulma, wow! You really
did turn into a turtle!

19:44.709 --> 19:47.667
Boy, I guess this kinda
changes our plans a bit, huh?

19:47.750 --> 19:49.125
[TORTOISE] Hmm?

19:49.209 --> 19:52.959
[BULMA] Goku? Who were you
talking to out there, kiddo?

19:53.042 --> 19:54.375
What?!

19:54.459 --> 19:57.000
[BULMA] Hm? Who are you?

19:57.084 --> 19:58.125
[GOKU] I thought he was you!

19:58.209 --> 20:00.084
[BULMA] Wha-?

20:00.167 --> 20:03.334
Strange... A tortoise
shouldn't be living around here!

20:03.417 --> 20:05.417
Aren't you supposed to
be living by the sea?

20:05.500 --> 20:06.834
Yeah.

20:06.917 --> 20:09.792
And I'm very concerned
about being so far from home.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.500
By the way, do you
have any salt water?

20:12.584 --> 20:14.375
Sure, we'll
fix you right up.

20:14.750 --> 20:18.792
[slurping]

20:18.875 --> 20:19.959
[burps]

20:20.042 --> 20:24.167
Good seawater.
Aromatic, yet full bodied.

20:24.250 --> 20:26.875
[BULMA] Yeah, I think
it's an eighty-seven.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.292
Nope, eighty-six!

20:28.375 --> 20:30.500
[BULMA] Really? Are
you sure about that?

20:30.584 --> 20:34.000
Mm-hm. I
know my water.

20:34.084 --> 20:35.792
So, what are
you doing here?

20:35.875 --> 20:38.209
Well to make a long
story incredibly short:

20:38.292 --> 20:41.834
I'm lost! It's that simple. I'm
lost! I've been trying to find

20:41.917 --> 20:46.209
my way back to the
sea for over a year now.

20:46.292 --> 20:47.875
That's so sad!

20:47.959 --> 20:49.917
And you're still not
anywhere near the sea.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
Hold on, let me go check
my map. Wait here a second.

20:56.334 --> 20:59.042
Bad news: you're
still a hundred miles away!

20:59.125 --> 21:01.334
Great, that'll
take me twenty years!

21:01.417 --> 21:03.500
Gosh! That sounds
like a long time.

21:03.584 --> 21:05.542
Hmm, I wish there was a
way that we could help you.

21:05.625 --> 21:07.375
Yeah. Hey, I know!

21:07.459 --> 21:09.667
Would you like me to carry
you to the sea, Mister Turtle?

21:09.750 --> 21:11.334
[TORTOISE] Why, yes! Thank you!

21:11.417 --> 21:13.042
Are you nuts?!

21:13.125 --> 21:15.417
But you just said that
you wished we could help!

21:15.500 --> 21:17.500
So why don't we just
take him to the sea?

21:17.584 --> 21:19.292
I didn't mean
that for real, Goku.

21:19.375 --> 21:20.709
We're on an adventure.

21:20.792 --> 21:23.875
We don't have time to transport
a beached turtle, okay?

21:23.959 --> 21:25.584
You're impossible!

21:25.667 --> 21:28.084
[BULMA] I'm impossible?!
What do you mean by that?!

21:28.167 --> 21:30.292
[GOKU] Well, if we're so pressed
for time, why did you just spend

21:30.375 --> 21:31.792
the whole morning in
front of the mirror

21:31.875 --> 21:33.042
worrying about your hair?!

21:33.125 --> 21:35.000
Fine, help the stupid
turtle if you want!

21:35.084 --> 21:37.875
I can find the Dragon
Balls by myself! Hmph!

21:38.959 --> 21:40.959
Gosh, are women like
this where you come from?

21:41.042 --> 21:43.042
No, most have tails.

21:44.125 --> 21:46.125
[BULMA] Sure, be that way!

21:46.209 --> 21:49.209
I hope you get a backache,
you little twerp! Hmph!

21:51.750 --> 21:53.209
Man! What a geek!

21:53.292 --> 21:54.875
I don't need his
stupid help, anyway!

21:54.959 --> 21:58.084
I can handle whatever
comes my way on my own!

21:58.167 --> 21:59.459
[roaring]

21:59.542 --> 22:00.500
Hm?!

22:06.709 --> 22:09.750
[BULMA] Stop! Stop,
or I'll run you down!

22:09.834 --> 22:11.584
I mean it, Goku!

22:11.667 --> 22:13.625
[TORTOISE] Oh, we better
stop. That girl scares me.

22:16.459 --> 22:17.709
Careful!

22:17.792 --> 22:19.625
You could mess up your
hair riding on that thing!

22:19.709 --> 22:22.000
[BULMA] Knock it off.
I decided to forgive you.

22:22.084 --> 22:24.459
[GOKU] Huh? What's
the matter? Scared?

22:24.542 --> 22:26.959
[BULMA] Me?
Scared? Give me a break!

22:27.042 --> 22:29.000
Let's just go find
those Dragon Balls.

22:29.084 --> 22:30.250

again next time for

22:30.334 --> 22:32.959
