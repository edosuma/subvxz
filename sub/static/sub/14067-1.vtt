00:00.700 --> 00:02.360
<i>Previously on Boston Legal…</i>

00:02.400 --> 00:03.700
Did you know…

00:03.700 --> 00:06.460
that Shirley Schmidt
has a cheerleading costume?

00:06.500 --> 00:09.160
Sometimes she puts it on.
–Complete with pom-poms.

00:09.200 --> 00:11.460
I would dress up and stand
in front of the mirror

00:11.500 --> 00:14.360
in the little skirt,
the white socks, the sweater.

00:14.400 --> 00:15.860
It somehow
made me feel better.

00:15.900 --> 00:18.460
Can you imagine Shirley
in her little cheer—

00:18.500 --> 00:19.700
Oh, my god.

00:19.700 --> 00:21.460
Denny, I got in!
I'm in the coast guard!

00:21.500 --> 00:22.300
What?

00:22.300 --> 00:23.060
–Uh…
–Am I in?

00:23.100 --> 00:25.360
I don't know,
did you get a letter?

00:25.400 --> 00:27.800
–I'm in!
–Ah! Ha ha!

00:27.800 --> 00:31.298
–We're in the coast guard!
–We're in the coast guard!

00:35.900 --> 00:39.200
♫ over there

00:39.500 --> 00:42.700
♫ send the word, send the word
over there

00:42.900 --> 00:45.100
♫ that the yanks are coming

00:45.100 --> 00:46.900
♫ the yanks are coming

00:46.900 --> 00:50.000
♫ the drums rum-tumming
ev'rywhere

00:50.000 --> 00:51.600
♫ and prepare ♫

00:51.600 --> 00:52.700
20° starboard.

00:52.700 --> 00:55.660
–Is that left or right?
–I mean port. Go port. Go—

00:55.700 --> 00:56.560
Hey, I'm the captain.

00:56.600 --> 00:59.260
Will you be quiet?
It's right in front of us.

00:59.300 --> 01:03.260
Oh, jeez.
♫ and we won't come back till
it's over over there ♫

01:03.300 --> 01:05.200
♫ hey, deejay,
turn me out?

01:05.300 --> 01:06.500
♫ you gotta…?

01:06.500 --> 01:09.060
♫ why don't you show me?
Get below me? ♫

01:09.100 --> 01:12.202
<i>United States
coast guard coming aboard.</i>

01:12.400 --> 01:13.654
<i>Nobody move.</i>

01:14.000 --> 01:16.700
You're all persons
of interest.

01:21.700 --> 01:22.960
Who's in charge of this event?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.376
–I am.
–Do you have a permit, ma'am?

01:25.700 --> 01:28.300
–For what?
–Right to assemble at sea's

01:28.300 --> 01:29.260
strictly forbidden without written

01:29.300 --> 01:32.360
and express authorization
from the United States coast guard.

01:32.400 --> 01:33.500
What?

01:33.500 --> 01:35.160
Sorry, ma'am.
We're in a war.

01:35.200 --> 01:38.900
But lucky for you,
and perhaps me later,

01:39.100 --> 01:40.700
I am the coast guard.

01:45.300 --> 01:46.760
I'm gonna let it go
this one time,

01:46.800 --> 01:47.860
but I'm going to have to

01:47.900 --> 01:50.860
make a thorough inspection
of your flotation devices.

01:50.900 --> 01:52.200
Brand-new.

01:52.400 --> 01:53.400
Well-done.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.500
Okay, Denny,
the situation is—

01:58.400 --> 02:02.000
How did you possibly
get out of your clothes so fast?

02:02.000 --> 02:03.716
Semper paratus, my friend.

02:04.100 --> 02:06.700
Always prepared—
Coast guard motto.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.400
And so it begins.

Boston Legal
Season 5, Episode 01

02:59.900 --> 03:01.000
Bethany.

03:01.500 --> 03:02.960
For the last seven years,

03:03.000 --> 03:05.960
I've basically had one case
that's consumed me.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.160
It's against A. B. Curtis,
the the tobacco company.

03:09.200 --> 03:10.360
And how's the family?

03:10.400 --> 03:13.060
These people have dragged me
through discovery.

03:13.100 --> 03:15.960
They've exhausted
my client's money, my money.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.360
They practically killed
my client's doctor.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.900
He's dead, Alan.

03:20.700 --> 03:21.660
He was a smoker?

03:21.700 --> 03:23.800
No, but he was in his 70s.

03:23.800 --> 03:26.200
They deposed him 13 times.

03:26.200 --> 03:27.560
He died over the weekend,

03:27.600 --> 03:29.460
just as we were about
to go to trial,

03:29.500 --> 03:31.360
no doubt from the stress
of it all.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.260
Now I don't have
a doctor to testify.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.860
I'll have to get
a continuance,

03:34.900 --> 03:37.460
which they'll then turn
into ten more continuances

03:37.500 --> 03:40.160
while they depose
my new doctor 13 more times.

03:40.200 --> 03:43.000
I can't do it.
I'm licked.

03:44.500 --> 03:47.600
Nobody successfully sues
a tobacco company.

03:47.700 --> 03:50.460
Even if you beat them
at trial, they just appeal.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.960
Law firms go bankrupt
trying to climb that hill.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.260
Oh, you know how I feel about money,
especially when it's yours.

03:56.300 --> 03:58.960
I must say, I echo Shirley's
sentiment. I do. I do.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.260
Tobacco companies
specialize in two things—

04:01.300 --> 04:02.960
One, getting people
addicted to cigarettes,

04:03.000 --> 04:05.860
and two, prolonging
and protracting pretrial litigation.

04:05.900 --> 04:07.860
I tell you, they simply
make cases too burdensome,

04:07.900 --> 04:09.360
even for big firms like us.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.760
Certainly more than could be
handled by your average dwarf.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.860
I, too, am against taking on
the tobacco company,

04:14.900 --> 04:18.266
and the firm absolutely
forbids you from taking it.

04:18.300 --> 04:21.899
Katie, Jerry, give Alan whatever
help he needs.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.300
Best of luck.

04:23.300 --> 04:24.500
Thank you.

04:25.900 --> 04:28.960
Denny, I could also use your help
if you're up for joining.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Mm. Whatever.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.460
<i>Mr Crane!
Mr Crane!</i>

04:37.500 --> 04:38.460
Mr Shore! Mr Shore!

04:38.500 --> 04:41.200
No comment. Nothing to say.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.900
Step aside, please.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.600
No comment.
Lawyers coming through.

04:45.700 --> 04:47.800
Handicapped.
Outta my way.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.200
Phoebe.

05:02.600 --> 05:03.600
Alan.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.800
Are you joining
as cocounsel?

05:08.800 --> 05:09.800
Yes.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.600
Excellent.

05:15.900 --> 05:19.600
Still married with, uh,
what is it they're called?

05:20.100 --> 05:22.000
–Children.
–Right.

05:22.100 --> 05:23.500
All rise.

05:24.200 --> 05:27.400
“3-2-4-6-3—in the matter
of the estate

05:27.400 --> 05:31.300
of Michael Rhodes vs
A. B. Curtis tobacco corporation,

05:31.300 --> 05:34.160
the complainant alleging
the civil cause of wrongful death,”

05:34.200 --> 05:36.060
this court is now in session,

05:36.100 --> 05:38.800
the honorable
Milton Brody presiding.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.200
Be seated.

05:41.700 --> 05:44.200
Okay. Both sides stand ready?

05:44.200 --> 05:47.760
Well, actually, your honor,
the defense would be requesting more time.

05:47.800 --> 05:50.160
The plaintiff has added
a witness to its list

05:50.200 --> 05:52.460
whom we've not had
the opportunity to depose.

05:52.500 --> 05:53.860
Therefore, I—
–The witness, your honor,

05:53.900 --> 05:57.760
is a doctor who will only be
 testifying as to cause of death.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.600
We are forced to call him

05:59.600 --> 06:01.760
because the doctor
we had planned to call—

06:01.800 --> 06:04.360
who has been called
again and again and again—

06:04.400 --> 06:05.760
died this past weekend

06:05.800 --> 06:09.560
after being deposed, harassed
and intimidated relentlessly

06:09.600 --> 06:12.700
for the last 7
of his 77 years.

06:12.700 --> 06:14.600
The fact is, my, uh…

06:15.200 --> 06:16.600
uh, uh, the defense,

06:16.600 --> 06:18.900
has employed
a plethora of tactics

06:18.900 --> 06:20.900
to delay a delay and delay.

06:20.900 --> 06:24.060
I'm curious. Do you have
any ideas that speed things up?

06:24.100 --> 06:26.160
Well, surrender works
quite well, and I do know

06:26.200 --> 06:28.360
how you love to wave a white flag.
–Objection!

06:28.400 --> 06:30.300
All right. All right.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.560
Ms Prentice,
I will give you a night—

06:32.600 --> 06:34.660
one night—
to review the new witnesses

06:34.700 --> 06:36.660
that have been added
to the plaintiff's list.

06:36.700 --> 06:40.300
We will begin at 10:00 a.m.
Tomorrow. Adjourned.

06:44.800 --> 06:45.500
You know…

06:55.900 --> 06:57.360
Once the cancer had metastasized,

06:57.400 --> 06:59.160
it became about managing his pain,

06:59.200 --> 07:01.200
which was extreme.

07:01.700 --> 07:04.060
Mr Rhodes told you
that he chose to smoke,

07:04.100 --> 07:07.664
am I right, doctor?
–Why, does that make it hurt less?

07:08.100 --> 07:09.400
I'd like to know.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.300
May I continue?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.100
Please.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.860
There were many other
cancer-causing agents

07:15.900 --> 07:17.960
that Mr Rhodes
was exposed to, right?

07:18.000 --> 07:19.660
I'm sorry. Is that going
to be your strategy,

07:19.700 --> 07:21.746
that something else killed him?

07:22.200 --> 07:23.660
We can suspend this
right now, Alan,

07:23.700 --> 07:24.860
and go see the judge

07:24.900 --> 07:26.560
if this is all too much
for you to handle.

07:26.600 --> 07:29.360
–Don't flatter yourself.
–No, I wasn't talking about me.

07:29.400 --> 07:30.700
Funny that you are.

07:30.700 --> 07:31.760
Something on your heart

07:31.800 --> 07:33.460
you'd like to share with
the rest of the group?

07:33.500 --> 07:35.360
I'm sorry. I meant
to say on your mind.

07:35.400 --> 07:36.500
Stop it.

07:36.500 --> 07:39.400
You two can get a room
after the trial.

07:41.800 --> 07:44.900
Uh, was an autopsy
ever performed, doctor?

07:44.900 --> 07:47.860
Oh, we didn't need an autopsy
to know what killed him.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.000
No autopsy.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.600
Are you kidding?

07:51.100 --> 07:51.900
Ms Rhodes—

07:51.900 --> 07:55.900
My father smoked for 50 years.
He died of lung cancer.

07:55.900 --> 07:58.660
Do you really mean to suggest—
–Ma'am, I need to–

07:58.700 --> 08:01.160
Have you ever
watched a person rot to death?

08:01.200 --> 08:04.360
Alan, maybe you can contain
your client's emotions,

08:04.400 --> 08:05.700
if not your own.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.700
What happened to you?

08:10.400 --> 08:11.720
All right. I'm done.

08:13.500 --> 08:16.460
If you plan to march into that courtroom
and ask for a continuance—

08:16.500 --> 08:19.400
No. I got what I need.
Did you?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Thank you.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.360
Is that how you plan
to try this case?

08:33.400 --> 08:35.059
Don't start with me,
Denny. All right?

08:35.100 --> 08:38.559
Do you have any idea how many
people die every day from cigarettes?

08:38.600 --> 08:40.514
Oh, please.
What else is new?

08:40.700 --> 08:43.960
Tobacco kills. Big deal.
–Did you just say “big deal”?

08:44.000 --> 08:45.960
–Well, it's old news.
–First of all,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.660
it's not just old news.
It's absolely current.

08:48.700 --> 08:53.300
The tobacco industry is more powerful today—
–It's boring.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.660
What, have we all just been desensitized?
Smoking kills. Whatever.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.350
We've all just gone numb.

09:02.300 --> 09:03.554
Why'd you say that?

09:04.800 --> 09:07.300
Who told you I went numb?

09:07.400 --> 09:08.800
Who said that?

09:09.000 --> 09:10.260
What are you talking about?

09:10.300 --> 09:12.800
You damn well k—

09:13.400 --> 09:14.260
Did she call you?

09:14.300 --> 09:18.062
Denny, I have no idea
what the hell you're talking about.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.750
So why don't you tell me?

09:20.800 --> 09:22.960
You have been
in a bad mood all day.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.100
What is up?

09:24.100 --> 09:26.700
Nothing's up.
That's the problem.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.000
My junk doesn't work.

09:30.400 --> 09:31.460
I beg your pardon?

09:31.500 --> 09:34.100
I went back
to the captain's quarters

09:34.100 --> 09:36.560
with one of the girls
from the hot tub…

09:36.600 --> 09:39.500
My junk failed me.
–Oh.

09:40.100 --> 09:41.960
–I'm done, Alan, dead.
–Denny—

09:42.000 --> 09:43.600
I wish I were dead.

09:43.700 --> 09:46.360
I'd have made a better showing
with rigor mortis.

09:46.400 --> 09:48.060
I'm dead. Done. It's over.

09:48.100 --> 09:50.600
Denny,
it happens to every guy.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.160
Has it happened to you?

09:52.200 --> 09:53.600
Once.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.584
Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.

09:55.600 --> 09:56.600
Hello.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Hello.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.200
How'd the deposition go?

10:00.300 --> 10:02.600
Fine. Why?

10:02.700 --> 10:04.760
There are rumors
you were horrendous.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.800
Alan, I'm happy to support

10:06.800 --> 10:09.100
your latest tilt
at the windmill,

10:09.100 --> 10:11.600
but we know one never really beats

10:11.700 --> 10:13.700
the tobacco industry, right?

10:13.700 --> 10:15.860
And if opportunity
for settlement does come,

10:15.900 --> 10:18.400
we will take it,
won't we?

10:18.500 --> 10:19.900
It's receded…

10:20.900 --> 10:22.400
like a turtle…

10:22.700 --> 10:25.100
too ashamed
to come out its shell.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.100
What?

10:38.400 --> 10:41.900
Shirley, could I, uh,
steal you for a second?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.700
It's about my penis.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.300
It's depressed.

10:47.300 --> 10:51.200
–I-I don't want to involve you, but—
–Don't even go there.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.000
Okay, okay.

10:53.100 --> 10:55.960
Would you at least put on
the cheerleader costume for me?

10:56.000 --> 10:56.860
Because—
–Sorry.

10:56.900 --> 10:58.760
Have you tried jumper cables?

10:58.800 --> 11:00.384
You think this is funny?

11:01.900 --> 11:05.200
Okay. Would you loan me
the cheerleading costume?

11:05.200 --> 11:08.170
–Denny…
–Give me a hand here, will you, Carl?

11:17.500 --> 11:19.360
–Two witnesses total?
–Bethany—

11:19.400 --> 11:22.460
I've spent 7 years preparing
more than 50 experts—

11:22.500 --> 11:23.800
Bethany…

11:23.800 --> 11:25.960
if we let this
turn into a science class—

11:26.000 --> 11:28.860
We have to prove addiction.
We have to show that—

11:28.900 --> 11:31.060
You asked me to try this case.
So let me—

11:31.100 --> 11:33.560
–Two⁈
–I want to rest as close as I can

11:33.600 --> 11:36.400
to the emotion
of the client's test—

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Where'd she go?

11:39.000 --> 11:39.900
She left.

11:39.900 --> 11:43.332
I must say, Alan, two witnesses
seems a bit bonkers.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.644
I would hope
you haven't gone mad.

11:46.600 --> 11:50.400
Katie, one problem we have
concerning trust—

11:50.400 --> 11:53.634
You and I haven't really
had a life together yet.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.260
Still harassing
the younger associates?

11:56.300 --> 11:58.800
So nice to see
you haven't changed.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.500
Why are you here?

12:06.000 --> 12:08.400
Well, I come in peace.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.400
$140,000.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.360
–For a death?
–It's all we're offering.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.160
It's all you could hope to get
since we'll appeal any verdict.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.660
And why drag this out beyond a time

12:17.700 --> 12:20.406
we're still attracted to each other, hmm?

12:23.100 --> 12:25.300
I'm not attracted to you now.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.600
Fine. Let's go with that.

12:30.400 --> 12:33.040
When I knew him,
he was mad, by the way.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.500
I think I'll be going.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.800
I have done hundreds
of these cases,

12:41.800 --> 12:43.860
and they all come out
the same way…

12:43.900 --> 12:46.300
So why stress yourself, Alan?

12:46.300 --> 12:49.996
It's not healthy. You'd be
better off taking up smoking.

12:52.900 --> 12:54.360
You know,
the thing is, Phoebe,

12:54.400 --> 12:55.900
you look the same,

12:55.900 --> 12:58.000
you smell the same…

12:58.900 --> 12:59.700
Mm.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.500
My, you even taste the same…

13:04.500 --> 13:08.000
But we both know
you've changed, don't we?

13:09.000 --> 13:10.460
I mean, when
we were together,

13:10.500 --> 13:12.700
the very idea of either of us

13:12.700 --> 13:15.100
doing battle for big tobacco—

13:15.500 --> 13:18.600
an industry which
systematically kills people…

13:21.900 --> 13:24.672
I hope they give you
a lot of money, then.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.600
Of course,
it would be worth it.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.700
Mm. And here you are
at Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.560
I don't need to apologize
for myself.

13:34.600 --> 13:35.900
No,

13:35.900 --> 13:38.060
Not when it's easier to just walk out the door.
–I didn't walk—

13:38.100 --> 13:39.400
Yes, you did.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.100
Yes, you did.

13:45.600 --> 13:46.900
You know what?

13:47.900 --> 13:50.276
I think
that you have changed, Alan.

13:51.200 --> 13:54.100
Your eyes look… Deadened.

13:55.400 --> 13:58.660
They say that a man's passion
is the first thing to die as he ages,

13:58.700 --> 14:02.760
so I suppose that should make it easier
 for me to be around you,

14:02.800 --> 14:04.800
because it was your passion

14:04.800 --> 14:06.900
that I so fell in love with.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.100
Your offer is rejected…

14:27.700 --> 14:29.300
so you can leave now.

14:31.400 --> 14:32.500
Okay, Alan.

14:36.700 --> 14:38.500
We'll be seeing you, then.

15:03.300 --> 15:05.860
He first started smoking cigarettes
when he was 11.

15:05.900 --> 15:07.660
He smoked
the defendant's brand?

15:07.700 --> 15:09.060
Mainly that brand, yes.

15:09.100 --> 15:11.560
And your father smoked
cigarettes for how long?

15:11.600 --> 15:12.700
Over 50 years.

15:12.700 --> 15:15.960
Maureen, at some point, your
father certainly had to know

15:16.000 --> 15:17.782
that smoking causes cancer.

15:17.900 --> 15:20.100
He tried to quit
so many times.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.860
He was desperate to quit,
but he was addicted.

15:22.900 --> 15:25.160
Sometimes he could
go months without,

15:25.200 --> 15:26.460
but he'd always
start up again.

15:26.500 --> 15:29.200
He just couldn't—
<i>–Oh, baby.</i>

15:29.200 --> 15:32.300
<i>Ohh, that feels so good.</i>

15:32.300 --> 15:34.100
<i>Don't stop.</i>

15:34.100 --> 15:35.600
<i>Ohh!</i>

15:36.900 --> 15:37.800
Hello?

15:37.800 --> 15:39.500
–Denny.
–It's my doctor.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.500
–I don't care.
–Shh.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.960
I did that,
but it still doesn't work.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.500
Get off the phone now.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.580
I gotta get off
the phone now.

15:50.400 --> 15:51.300
What?

15:53.400 --> 15:54.500
I'm sorry.

15:56.900 --> 16:00.398
And a-at some point,
your father did get lung cancer.

16:00.400 --> 16:01.900
11 years ago.

16:02.500 --> 16:05.800
He fought it. He—
He had one lung removed.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.800
He did everything that…

16:09.600 --> 16:11.300
But, um…

16:11.700 --> 16:14.100
eventually
it went to his brain.

16:14.200 --> 16:17.500
In the end, it was, uh,
a miserable…

16:17.900 --> 16:19.900
excruciating death.

16:20.800 --> 16:24.100
Maureen, in fairness,
the dangers of smoking

16:24.100 --> 16:26.100
have been well-known

16:26.100 --> 16:28.200
for some time by everybody,

16:28.200 --> 16:29.800
including your father.

16:29.800 --> 16:32.000
That fact
only made it worse.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.200
I had to watch my father

16:34.200 --> 16:36.600
do something over and over,

16:36.600 --> 16:38.100
all day, every day,

16:38.200 --> 16:41.300
that he knew
would eventually kill him,

16:41.300 --> 16:42.960
and he just couldn't stop.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.400
He was addicted
since childhood,

16:45.400 --> 16:47.000
terribly addicted.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.760
You don't keep doing that
to yourself for no reason.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.360
You do it because you
physically can't stop.

16:52.400 --> 16:55.160
She's no foundation to give
medical or sci—

16:55.200 --> 16:56.800
He was my father.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.500
That's my foundation.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.084
It wasn't just physical.

17:11.900 --> 17:14.260
He suffered the shame
of being an addict,

17:14.300 --> 17:16.359
and even if you're
heartless enough to think,

17:16.400 --> 17:20.099
well, he signed on for this,
I never signed up for it.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.560
I'm sorry if I sound selfish,
but I never said,

17:22.599 --> 17:25.160
“sure, I'll watch my father
go through that agony.”

17:25.200 --> 17:27.500
My children never agreed

17:27.500 --> 17:29.744
they'd lose their grandpa the way…

17:31.500 --> 17:33.300
There was so much pain…

17:34.400 --> 17:35.960
So much pain to so many people

17:36.000 --> 17:38.300
who never signed up for it.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.800
First let me say…

17:41.100 --> 17:44.000
how sorry I am for your loss.

17:44.300 --> 17:46.676
Losing a family member
to cancer is…

17:47.400 --> 17:48.860
Is this the first time?

17:48.900 --> 17:50.400
Um, no. Actually—

17:50.400 --> 17:52.960
–So cancer runs in your family then?
–Objection.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.360
Your honor, there has been
a recent medical study

17:55.400 --> 17:57.760
that found that there is
a common genetic variant

17:57.800 --> 18:00.460
that actually doubles
the risk of lung cancer.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.160
It can run in the family.
–Oh, yes.

18:02.200 --> 18:05.170
It was just a big coincidence
that he smoked.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.960
Was your father ever tested
for this genetic variant?

18:09.000 --> 18:09.900
No.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.960
I understand that your father
worked in a paper mill,

18:13.000 --> 18:14.260
which since—
–Are you kidding?

18:14.300 --> 18:17.700
–Mr Shore.
<i>oh, baby. Ohh!</i>

18:17.800 --> 18:21.600
<i>that feels so good.
don't stop.</i>

18:27.200 --> 18:29.700
Um, Ms Rhodes,

18:29.900 --> 18:31.800
how many houses do you think

18:31.800 --> 18:34.360
your father lived in
during his lifetime?

18:34.400 --> 18:36.260
I'm not sure.
Maybe six or seven.

18:36.300 --> 18:38.600
Did any of them
contain asbestos?

18:38.600 --> 18:41.200
Uh, I-I don't really know.
Perhaps.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.660
What about arsenic
or silica or chromium?

18:43.700 --> 18:46.860
Were any of his houses tested
for any of these substances?

18:46.900 --> 18:48.960
All of which can cause
lung cancer,

18:49.000 --> 18:50.600
if you wonder why I ask.

18:50.600 --> 18:53.260
I don't know if they were
tested for those substances.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.400
–What about radon?
–Radon?

18:55.400 --> 18:58.360
Yes, radon. It's a gas.
It comes from rocks and dirt.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.260
It gets trapped in houses
and buildings.

19:00.300 --> 19:01.560
It's quite common, actually.

19:01.600 --> 19:05.300
Odorless, colorless
and it also causes lung cancer.

19:05.400 --> 19:09.100
Were any of your father's homes
ever tested for radon?

19:09.900 --> 19:11.500
Not to my knowledge.

19:11.700 --> 19:12.800
I see.

19:14.200 --> 19:15.100
Thank you.

19:15.100 --> 19:18.000
And, again,
my deepest condolences

19:18.000 --> 19:19.500
for your loss.

19:36.500 --> 19:37.500
How'd it go?

19:41.000 --> 19:41.900
Okay.

19:43.300 --> 19:46.660
–Hey, hey! You're hurting me.
–What the hell was that with the phone?

19:46.700 --> 19:48.760
My doctor's idea.
He thought it might stimulate—

19:48.800 --> 19:49.960
For god sake, Denny,

19:50.000 --> 19:51.060
I'm in the middle of a trial
and I hear—

19:51.100 --> 19:52.160
Well, I tried
putting it on vibrate,

19:52.200 --> 19:54.560
but it wasn't the s—
–I asked you to be part of this case

19:54.600 --> 19:56.600
because I could use your help.

19:56.600 --> 19:59.560
This is a tobacco industry we're up against!
–I know— I know— I know that.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.260
It is near impossible to beat
them, and my odds do not improve

20:01.300 --> 20:04.800
by my cocounsel's
phone chirping, “ooh, baby, baby,”

20:05.100 --> 20:07.260
while I'm trying to cross-examine a witness.
–It was a medical emergency!

20:07.300 --> 20:09.660
Medical emergency? Because
you couldn't get it up in a hot tub?

20:09.700 --> 20:11.760
–Hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't attack me just 'cause—
–You know, not everything in life

20:11.800 --> 20:13.460
–You're getting your ass kicked by your ex-girlfriend.
–Takes a backseat to your sex life.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.060
You're not in high school, Denny.
–All I did was accept a call—

20:15.100 --> 20:19.260
–As sophomoric as you're determined to be—
–Well, forgive me for expecting a little sympathy.

20:19.300 --> 20:21.560
–Sympathy? My client's father is dead!
–But here I am, I'm struggling with who and what I am.

20:21.600 --> 20:22.660
–I turn to my best friend…
–You want sympathy because your penis failed!

20:22.700 --> 20:25.560
–He treats me with contempt—
–No, I'm sorry. I'm not giving you sympathy, Denny.

20:25.600 --> 20:30.748
–I'm just trying to get an erection!
–Well, who knows? Maybe it's the mad cow.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.718
I'm sure it's not that.

20:35.900 --> 20:37.000
What if it is?

20:37.300 --> 20:38.300
Eh…

20:39.300 --> 20:41.000
My penis has Alzheimer's.

20:41.200 --> 20:44.600
No, Denny. you just… Had an off day.

20:47.200 --> 20:51.160
You said it happened to you once.
What were the ciumstances?

20:51.600 --> 20:55.400
–It was with her, actually— Phoebe.
–What happened?

20:57.400 --> 20:58.918
I was in love with her.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Oh. That'll kill the moment.

21:01.700 --> 21:06.300
And she loved me,
just… not enough.

21:07.400 --> 21:12.460
I mean, no relationship is ever quite even.
There's always an imbalance of sorts.

21:12.500 --> 21:17.120
One person loves or is in love
just a little more than the other, but…

21:20.400 --> 21:22.314
I just couldn't handle being…

21:26.500 --> 21:28.200
So I left.

21:36.100 --> 21:37.684
Maybe it's not too late.

21:37.800 --> 21:40.060
She's happily married with children.

21:40.100 --> 21:41.500
Oh.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.000
It's too late.

21:51.900 --> 21:55.360
And personally, I take great offense
at constantly being vilified.

21:55.400 --> 21:59.000
Well, tobacco companies
do make for juicy targets.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.360
Well, let me tell you something—

22:00.400 --> 22:03.106
Car manufacturers
make products that kill

22:03.200 --> 22:06.698
if you want to look
at vehicular fatality statistics.

22:06.700 --> 22:11.600
Alcohol— forget it.
But we also do some good along the way.

22:11.700 --> 22:12.960
Nobody wants to talk about that.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Oh, please. What good?

22:15.200 --> 22:20.000
How about this? We spend billions
of dollars in antismoking campaigns

22:20.200 --> 22:22.900
and youth prevention efforts.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.960
How many industries actually spend money

22:25.000 --> 22:27.760
to discourage people
from buying their product?

22:27.800 --> 22:32.200
That is an unprecedented display
of corporate conscience.

22:33.400 --> 22:37.160
In fairness, you might have mentioned
the “American journal of public health” study

22:37.200 --> 22:40.360
that found teens who watch antismoking
ads aimed at young people

22:40.400 --> 22:43.900
were actually 36% more likely to smoke.

22:44.100 --> 22:45.660
I don't agree with their findings.

22:45.700 --> 22:48.660
I bet you also disagree with
the numerous public health advocates

22:48.700 --> 22:51.660
who've called for a ban
on all youth antismoking campaigns

22:51.700 --> 22:53.360
funded by the tobacco industries,

22:53.400 --> 22:56.160
charging they employ insidious
reverse psychology,

22:56.200 --> 22:58.860
deliberately designed
to get teens to smoke.

22:58.900 --> 23:00.600
Well, there again is an—

23:00.700 --> 23:03.160
Like cigarettes flavored
with chocolate, strawberry

23:03.200 --> 23:06.260
and candy spices to lure children.
–We don't do that anymore a—

23:06.300 --> 23:08.160
Because it was finally outlawed.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.860
At which point,
you turned your focus to menthol,

23:10.900 --> 23:12.960
which is neat, si—
–Menthol is legal.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.860
And profitable, since it's the cigarette
of choice for 75% of African-Americans.

23:16.900 --> 23:18.660
–Look—
–Look at what? Your product,

23:18.700 --> 23:23.900
even when used as directed, kills
one-third to one-half of its consumers.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.860
In fact, cigarettes
kill more than car accidents,

23:26.900 --> 23:30.400
homicides, suicides, AIDS
and drugs combined—

23:31.400 --> 23:34.100
One death every six seconds.

23:35.100 --> 23:37.400
So just during your testimony…

23:38.700 --> 23:41.340
another 50 or 60 people
have choked out.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.560
Your company murders people,
Mr Buttram.

23:44.600 --> 23:46.910
–Objection, your honor.
–Sustained.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.100
Mr Espenson, uh,
emotion has no play here,

23:50.300 --> 23:53.560
and unless you can ask questions,
we're moving on.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.300
Oh, get a grip, judge.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.100
Sorry.

24:08.800 --> 24:11.600
♫ doctor, my woman

24:11.700 --> 24:16.600
♫ is comin' back home late today

24:16.800 --> 24:19.800
♫ could you maybe give me something?

24:22.000 --> 24:25.200
♫ 'cause the feeling is gone

24:25.300 --> 24:30.600
♫ and I must get it
back right away

24:31.100 --> 24:39.600
♫ before she sees that
I've been up, down

24:39.800 --> 24:44.700
♫ tryin' to get the feelin' again

24:44.800 --> 24:48.500
♫ the one that made me shiver

24:48.700 --> 24:51.600
♫ made my knees start to quiver

24:51.700 --> 24:54.200
♫ every time she walked in

24:55.400 --> 24:58.800
♫ and I've looked high, high

24:58.900 --> 25:00.500
♫ low low

25:00.600 --> 25:05.400
♫ everywhere I possibly can high

25:05.500 --> 25:07.500
♫ but there's no low

25:07.700 --> 25:11.800
♫ tryin' to get the feelin' again

25:12.400 --> 25:15.900
♫ it seemed to disappear

25:16.100 --> 25:20.400
♫ as fast as it came

25:20.500 --> 25:23.760
♫ and I been lookin' I been lookin',
I been lookin'

25:23.800 --> 25:25.400
♫ I been up up

25:25.500 --> 25:27.500
♫ and down down

25:27.600 --> 25:29.778
♫ and tryin' to get the feelin' ♫

25:29.800 --> 25:31.100
All yours.

25:34.400 --> 25:35.800
Excuse me?

25:36.200 --> 25:38.400
I said the witness is all yours.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.500
Oh. Oh.

25:42.800 --> 25:44.400
Thank you.

25:46.400 --> 25:47.800
Were you delusional?

25:47.800 --> 25:51.200
Not delusional so much as…
I don't know,

25:51.200 --> 25:54.302
like I was in another universe
all of a sudden…

25:55.000 --> 25:56.400
Somewhere on cable.

25:56.700 --> 25:59.160
There's only one explanation.
You're still in love with her.

25:59.200 --> 26:00.300
No.

26:01.300 --> 26:05.400
No, I'm just reminded
of what it felt like to love her.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.600
She said that my eyes…

26:11.100 --> 26:12.552
that the fire was gone

26:12.600 --> 26:15.702
and that passion
is the first thing to go when…

26:18.100 --> 26:21.004
That's been one of my
greatest fears, Denny,

26:21.500 --> 26:22.820
that as I got older…

26:24.200 --> 26:26.600
“deadened” was
the word she used.

26:29.400 --> 26:30.500
Deadened.

26:32.300 --> 26:35.500
You in the eyes,
me in the junk.

26:36.900 --> 26:38.550
On top of it, I'm losing.

26:39.100 --> 26:42.960
I think I made a huge mistake
not putting up more witnesses.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.760
She just put up a mountain
of expert testimony.

26:45.800 --> 26:49.700
Alan… when you step up
to do your closings,

26:50.600 --> 26:52.250
you're anything but dead.

26:52.600 --> 26:55.240
She hasn't got a taste
of your case yet.

26:55.300 --> 26:59.400
She has no idea of how undead
you become in that courtroom.

27:08.600 --> 27:10.300
A masterpiece of nature.

27:11.100 --> 27:13.212
Oh, come on. She's not that hot.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.582
I wasn't talking about her.

27:19.900 --> 27:22.500
Denny, I need to go work
on my closing.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.800
I'm very confused.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.900
As I said, tobacco companies
do make for easy targets.

27:36.300 --> 27:39.300
And I am sure that there is a part of you

27:39.400 --> 27:40.918
that wants to get them.

27:41.300 --> 27:45.800
So if you find that my client caused
the death of Mr Rhodes,

27:45.900 --> 27:47.400
then by all means,

27:47.800 --> 27:50.506
return with a judgment
for the plaintiff.

27:51.400 --> 27:54.800
But you simply can't make
that finding here.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.100
Yes, he smoked.

27:57.500 --> 28:00.160
His daughter says that
it was mostly my client's brand,

28:00.200 --> 28:02.708
but we have no substantiation of that.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.360
And while cigarettes may be
the most probable culprit,

28:06.400 --> 28:08.700
no autopsy was ever done.

28:10.900 --> 28:14.300
He wants you to decide
this on emotion.

28:15.200 --> 28:17.360
But as judge Brody
has already instructed,

28:17.400 --> 28:20.200
emotion has no play here.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.300
This is a court of law,

28:22.400 --> 28:27.500
and as such, I will ask that
you rule on the evidence.

28:28.500 --> 28:29.500
After all…

28:30.500 --> 28:34.300
you did take an oath
to do exactly that.

29:07.200 --> 29:10.060
Michael Rhodes smoked
cigarettes for 50 years,

29:10.100 --> 29:11.900
got lung cancer and died.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.200
We all know what happened here.

29:14.500 --> 29:16.600
We also all know this death.

29:16.700 --> 29:18.660
Everybody in this room knows somebody

29:18.700 --> 29:23.200
who has fought this same battle
and died… agonizing,

29:23.400 --> 29:25.500
brutal, excru—

29:32.600 --> 29:36.100
But emotion has no play here.

29:37.200 --> 29:40.660
Michael Rhodes was 11 years old
when he started smoking.

29:40.700 --> 29:42.700
It was 1948.

29:42.800 --> 29:44.960
At that time, there was no known risk,

29:45.000 --> 29:47.100
and even if there were, at 11,

29:47.200 --> 29:49.660
he certainly lacked the capacity
to assume it.

29:49.700 --> 29:51.260
And after that, he was addicted.

29:51.300 --> 29:54.500
They manufacture them to be addictive.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.060
In just the last few years,

29:56.100 --> 29:57.960
they've increased the amount of nicotine

29:58.000 --> 30:02.360
in the average cigarette by 11.6%
to make them even more addictive.

30:02.400 --> 30:05.360
Recently, we learned that tobacco
companies have been adding

30:05.400 --> 30:08.160
an ammonia-based compound
to cigarettes for years

30:08.200 --> 30:10.260
to increase absorption of nicotine.

30:10.300 --> 30:12.860
It's basically the same principle
used in crack cocaine.

30:12.900 --> 30:17.000
And let's look at the obscene strategy
they've employed here.

30:17.100 --> 30:19.100
Smoking may cause cancer,

30:19.200 --> 30:21.560
but it didn't cause
this particular cancer.

30:21.600 --> 30:22.960
It wasn't our cigarettes

30:23.000 --> 30:26.400
or it was genetic
or asbestos or a paper mill.

30:26.700 --> 30:29.340
Never do they take responsibility, ever.

30:29.500 --> 30:30.160
And god forbid—

30:30.200 --> 30:32.260
If you sue them, they'll bury you
and your lawyer.

30:32.300 --> 30:35.060
They might even depose your doctor
to death for good measure.

30:35.100 --> 30:39.700
All their insidious methods
and cunning corporate tactics

30:39.800 --> 30:40.760
aren't just history.

30:40.800 --> 30:43.800
It's what they continue to do now, today,

30:44.200 --> 30:46.960
because the tobacco industry
is like a nest of cockroaches.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.460
They will always find a way to survive.
–Objection.

30:49.500 --> 30:53.600
They still go after kids
with one strategy after another.

30:53.700 --> 30:55.660
They put up brightly colored ads

30:55.700 --> 30:57.960
at kids' eye level in convenience stores.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.860
They hire gorgeous twentysomethings

30:59.900 --> 31:02.660
to frequent popular venues
and seduce young adults

31:02.700 --> 31:05.060
into attending lavish
corporate-sponsored parties.

31:05.100 --> 31:07.410
Cockroaches will always find a way.

31:07.500 --> 31:10.960
They can't advertise on TV,
but they've hired PR Agencies

31:11.000 --> 31:13.560
to hook them up with the film
industry, and it's worked.

31:13.600 --> 31:15.960
Researchers estimate
that smoking in movies

31:16.000 --> 31:20.900
delivers nearly 400,000 new
adolescent smokers every year.

31:20.900 --> 31:22.960
Every time you try
to kill the cockroach,

31:23.000 --> 31:23.960
it finds another way.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.760
It has to, because when you make
a product that kills off your consumers,

31:27.800 --> 31:30.968
you have to find a way
to recruit new customers.

31:31.000 --> 31:31.660
They've now got

31:31.700 --> 31:35.500
a new feminized version
of the macho Camel brand,

31:35.600 --> 31:38.160
using slogans like,
“light and luscious,”

31:38.200 --> 31:39.860
uh, with hot pink packaging.

31:39.900 --> 31:43.160
Uh, Virginia Slims advertised
their “thin” cigarette.

31:43.200 --> 31:46.660
“Allure” magazine did a whole spread
on the cigarette diet.

31:46.700 --> 31:49.360
They use social and
psychological profiling,

31:49.400 --> 31:52.460
targeting potential smokers
by gender, ethnicity,

31:52.500 --> 31:54.760
sexual preference,
socioeconomic groups.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.560
Cockroaches don't discriminate.

31:56.600 --> 31:59.300
Their CEO comes
into this courtroom

31:59.400 --> 32:01.460
gloating over their
antismoking campaign,

32:01.500 --> 32:04.100
which is designed
to get kids to smoke.

32:04.600 --> 32:08.200
In 2005, they spent
more than $15 billion

32:08.300 --> 32:09.660
on advertising and promotion.

32:09.700 --> 32:13.200
That's a 225% increase from 1998,

32:13.300 --> 32:17.160
and they have the audacity to declare
they're trying to discourage smoking.

32:17.200 --> 32:20.764
This is not how corporations
with a conscience behave.

32:22.300 --> 32:24.760
How in God's name are
cigarettes even legal?

32:24.800 --> 32:26.800
Can anybody tell me that?

32:27.000 --> 32:29.360
They are a deadly concoction
of carcinogens

32:29.400 --> 32:32.700
that damage every single organ
in your body.

32:32.900 --> 32:35.360
Why do we not ban them?
Because it's a free country?

32:35.400 --> 32:37.960
Because freedom of choice
is an American ideal

32:38.000 --> 32:40.460
worth somebody dying every six seconds?

32:40.500 --> 32:41.760
How can any company,

32:41.800 --> 32:44.160
especially one
with such a conscience, no less,

32:44.200 --> 32:47.760
knowingly manufacture a product
that poisons its users,

32:47.800 --> 32:51.260
and make that product look cool
and hip and sexy and fun

32:51.300 --> 32:52.760
so they can get children?

32:52.800 --> 32:53.760
How can any attorney

32:53.800 --> 32:56.060
defend a company that
would do such a thing?

32:56.100 --> 32:59.202
And how can any society
tolerate it? But we do.

33:02.700 --> 33:07.100
There is no conscience at big tobacco.

33:07.300 --> 33:09.060
There is no conscience in Washington,

33:09.100 --> 33:11.660
which has been bought
and paid for by this industry.

33:11.700 --> 33:14.600
Conscience has to come
from you, the jury.

33:15.100 --> 33:16.960
If real regulation is to happen,

33:17.000 --> 33:18.584
it has to come from you.

33:20.300 --> 33:22.660
People are smoking
day after day after day

33:22.700 --> 33:24.460
and dying and dying and dying,

33:24.500 --> 33:27.060
and the tobacco companies
keep getting richer and richer.

33:27.100 --> 33:30.500
Last year alone, they made
$12 billion in profits.

33:30.600 --> 33:31.900
How can that be?

33:32.600 --> 33:34.100
How can that be?

34:12.500 --> 34:13.600
What?

34:13.800 --> 34:15.659
How about we win,
you come back to my place,

34:15.699 --> 34:18.802
get in the hot tub naked,
and I'll bob for you?

34:19.600 --> 34:21.000
That's a pass.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.400
Alan…

34:25.500 --> 34:28.960
My client has expressed an interest
in working this out.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.760
–That's a pass, too.
–Don't you want to hear a number?

34:31.800 --> 34:33.978
I don't need to hear your number.

34:34.500 --> 34:37.500
–Excuse me. Jury has a verdict.
–Already?

34:39.000 --> 34:40.782
Let's go hear their number.

34:52.400 --> 34:54.260
Maybe we should at least listen
to what they have to say.

34:54.300 --> 34:57.200
It's not too late.
–Yes, it is, for them.

34:57.900 --> 34:58.500
Bethany—–

34:58.600 --> 35:00.660
Mr Foreman, the jury
has reached a verdict?

35:00.700 --> 35:03.500
–We have, your honor.
–What say you?

35:04.900 --> 35:07.860
In the matter of Rhodes vs
A. B. Curtis tobacco company,

35:07.900 --> 35:09.560
on the count of wrongful death,

35:09.600 --> 35:13.100
we find in favor of the plaintiff.

35:13.300 --> 35:14.300
Hot damn!

35:14.400 --> 35:19.560
And we order the defendant to pay
compensatory damages in the amount of $600,000.

35:19.600 --> 35:23.060
We further order the defendant
to pay punitive damages

35:23.100 --> 35:27.200
in the amount of $213 million.

35:27.500 --> 35:28.400
What?

35:29.800 --> 35:32.060
Defense moves for a judgment
notwithstanding the verdict.

35:32.100 --> 35:33.000
Denied.

35:33.200 --> 35:35.360
Defense moves
to set aside the award as excessive.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.900
–Denied.
–We appeal.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.894
So noted. Members of the jury,
this completes your service.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.660
The, uh, court dismisses you
with their thanks,

35:44.700 --> 35:46.900
and we are adjourned.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.508
You gotta feel like getting naked now.

35:53.600 --> 35:54.700
Mr Shore…

35:56.000 --> 35:58.640
I don't know what to say.
–Neither do I.

35:59.300 --> 36:02.300
Alan… thank you so, so much.

36:03.300 --> 36:05.600
Alan, uh, a second, please…

36:06.100 --> 36:07.200
In private?

36:15.400 --> 36:18.400
Well… congratulations.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.060
Obviously, we'll be fighting this.

36:21.100 --> 36:26.000
It'll be years and years before
this thing is remotely over.

36:26.200 --> 36:29.632
I've got time. It's not as
if I'm dying or anything.

36:30.300 --> 36:33.300
No, you're… quite not.

36:38.100 --> 36:39.900
Well, I, um…

36:40.400 --> 36:43.100
I don't do appellate work,

36:43.300 --> 36:45.760
so'll be passing
this on to another lawyer…

36:45.800 --> 36:47.100
So…

36:48.700 --> 36:50.680
I guess this is good-bye then.

36:52.300 --> 36:53.900
Yes.

36:59.300 --> 37:00.700
Well…

37:08.600 --> 37:10.100
Good-bye, Alan.

37:25.100 --> 37:26.400
Good-bye.

37:40.300 --> 37:41.700
You still have me.

37:43.200 --> 37:44.784
It's not quite the same.

37:45.400 --> 37:46.660
But you know what, Denny?

37:46.700 --> 37:50.200
Sometimes it comes remarkably close.

37:51.200 --> 37:55.500
What you said to me
about being undead in the courtroom,

37:55.600 --> 37:57.000
it…

37:59.500 --> 38:01.060
It's not lost on me how lucky I am

38:01.100 --> 38:03.476
to have somebody in my life who can…

38:06.400 --> 38:08.842
I don't know what I'd do without you.

38:19.500 --> 38:21.200
Ahh.

38:22.100 --> 38:23.960
You know, as much
as I hate cigarettes,

38:24.000 --> 38:26.900
I so miss the cigarette break—

38:27.700 --> 38:32.200
A little respite where coworkers would
go outside and be communal,

38:32.300 --> 38:37.000
discuss the trivial annoyances
and affections in their lives

38:37.200 --> 38:40.500
that always turned out
to be anything but trivial.

38:41.900 --> 38:44.474
And to think, I might not
even know you

38:45.400 --> 38:49.060
but for the fact that we both like
to smoke these smelly cancer sticks

38:49.100 --> 38:51.600
that can only be smoked outside.

38:53.300 --> 38:54.800
Hmm.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.784
That would be a tragedy.

38:58.600 --> 39:01.438
I especially can't imagine
being alone now…

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
when my junk has Alzheimer's.
–Denny.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.660
Well, it's a symptom.
You said so yourself.

39:07.700 --> 39:08.900
It figures.

39:09.000 --> 39:12.300
For me, it would be
the first thing to go.

39:13.700 --> 39:14.600
What's that?

39:14.700 --> 39:19.500
What? Oh. I didn't see it.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.100
Ohh.

39:32.500 --> 39:33.700
Is that the—

39:33.900 --> 39:34.900
it—

39:35.600 --> 39:37.100
N—
–See ya.

39:37.600 --> 39:40.306
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
At least let me see it.

39:49.300 --> 39:50.900
Oh, my.

39:52.300 --> 39:54.742
It's a two-piece, Denny. A share toy.

39:54.800 --> 39:55.960
–Forget it.
–Come on.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.360
–It was a gift to me.
–You take top. I'll take bottom.

39:58.400 --> 40:00.500
Not a chance. Ooh.

40:01.100 --> 40:02.100
What?

40:02.200 --> 40:05.400
I'm cured. I'm back. I'm gone.

40:05.500 --> 40:06.560
Whoawhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:06.600 --> 40:09.600
Why not savor this moment?

40:09.800 --> 40:11.660
At my age, I'm lucky to last a moment.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.660
You take the top, I'll take the bottom.

40:13.700 --> 40:15.160
Tomorrow we'll switch off.

40:15.200 --> 40:17.660
It'll be just like the 3-way
you've always wanted.

40:17.700 --> 40:20.076
I never wanted you as part of the 3.

40:20.600 --> 40:21.900
Denny…

40:22.800 --> 40:25.200
I have never asked you for anything.

40:25.300 --> 40:27.900
I am your best friend.
–Oh, Alan!

40:28.100 --> 40:31.700
How can you possibly be
so selfish and cruel?

40:42.300 --> 40:43.500
Don't ruin it.

40:44.200 --> 40:46.900
–Oh, my God.
–See ya.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.300
What's your rush? Slow down.

40:50.500 --> 40:51.800
Treat her right.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.500
Romance her a little.

40:58.900 --> 41:00.000
At least…

41:00.600 --> 41:02.100
dance with her first.

41:02.500 --> 41:04.200
Dance?

41:06.100 --> 41:08.100
Hold her. Drink her in.

41:09.500 --> 41:10.700
Cherish her.

41:10.800 --> 41:11.500
♫ “L”

41:12.300 --> 41:16.900
♫ is for the way you look at me

41:17.000 --> 41:18.800
♫ “O” is for… ♫

41:18.900 --> 41:20.600
This is magic.

41:21.300 --> 41:22.500
It's fantastic.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.700
–God, are we weird?
–So weird.

41:26.900 --> 41:32.000
♫ extraordinary
“e” is even more

41:32.100 --> 41:34.700
♫ than anyone that you adore

41:34.800 --> 41:37.500
♫ and love was made

41:37.600 --> 41:40.800
♫ for me and you ♫
