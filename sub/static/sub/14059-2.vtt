by some townies?

36:49.976 --> 36:52.078
Who knows?
Next place we go,
you might actually get killed.

36:52.145 --> 36:54.881
<i>At least we'll be doing</i>
<i>something we wanna do...</i>

36:54.948 --> 36:57.784
instead of sitting around
in Edenfalls, turning into
a bunch of rich assholes.

36:57.851 --> 37:00.721
Now, situations
can change, you know.

37:02.288 --> 37:04.858
What do you mean?

37:04.925 --> 37:06.527
<i>Well,</i>

37:06.593 --> 37:10.897
I... wasn't gonna
tell you this, but...

37:10.964 --> 37:12.966
there is another way.

37:14.935 --> 37:19.573
I saw Hugh last night,
and he's got one
of these big deals closing.

37:19.640 --> 37:22.643
[ Clicks Tongue ]
He's always got some
big‐ass deal going on.

37:22.709 --> 37:25.512
Yeah, but it's
a hundred and fifty million,

37:25.579 --> 37:28.448
and my cut would be 13.

37:30.283 --> 37:32.886
Million?
That's right.

37:32.953 --> 37:34.420
Thirteen million dollars?

37:34.487 --> 37:38.825
It's a land deal.
If everything goes right,
it should be a few months.

37:38.892 --> 37:42.128
If Pete's a problem,
then we'll just
pay him off again.

37:42.195 --> 37:45.431
So why the hell
are we going to Mexico?

37:45.498 --> 37:50.103
What about Dale? What the hell
is he doing in Edenfalls,
and what does he want from us?

37:50.170 --> 37:51.738
I'll deal with Dale.

37:51.805 --> 37:55.441
<i>Maybe we could buy</i>
<i>a house on an island.</i>

37:55.509 --> 37:59.179
For $13 million, we can get
our own castle in Ireland.

37:59.245 --> 38:02.716
‐ This real?
‐ Yeah. I saw the papers.

38:02.783 --> 38:05.218
All we gotta do
is be the Riches
for a few months.

38:05.285 --> 38:10.090
Deal closes, we cash in,
check out and adios,
just like any other con.

38:10.156 --> 38:11.925
Thirteen million dollars.

38:11.992 --> 38:15.629
Well, then we wouldn't
always have to be running.

38:15.696 --> 38:18.398
We wouldn't always
have to be scared
of every redneck cop.

38:18.464 --> 38:20.767
<i>Every man</i>
<i>has his price, huh?</i>

38:22.603 --> 38:24.505
No. It's not
about that, Cael.

38:24.571 --> 38:26.507
No? What's it about?

38:26.573 --> 38:29.510
It's about being free.
