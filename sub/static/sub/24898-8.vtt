00:05.360 --> 00:06.991
Good morning, Bishop!

00:07.126 --> 00:09.094
Blaster 109.7.

00:09.233 --> 00:11.448
We have got some special
guests in the...

00:30.021 --> 00:32.222
Oh!

00:35.150 --> 00:36.161
Hey!

00:39.230 --> 00:40.518
What's up, Dave?

00:41.839 --> 00:43.266
Early bird catches the fish?

00:43.301 --> 00:44.393
Me? Nah.

00:44.869 --> 00:46.589
Just wanted to get your
advice on something.

00:49.821 --> 00:51.276
I'm thinking about getting a tattoo.

00:52.188 --> 00:55.011
Is that ridiculous? Am I too old
to be hopping on the tattoo train?

01:01.773 --> 01:02.812
Hey, Harley.

01:03.359 --> 01:05.087
Maybe I should just get
a temporary tattoo.

01:05.122 --> 01:06.389
See if I like it.

01:09.447 --> 01:10.480
Hey.

01:13.131 --> 01:14.176
Harley?

01:15.433 --> 01:17.067
Why didn't you tell me about this?

01:21.305 --> 01:23.073
Good morning, Bishop!

01:35.087 --> 01:40.087
Synced and corrected by Pisuly

01:59.931 --> 02:01.272
Good morning.

02:03.494 --> 02:06.696
Did you forget that night
time is sleeping time?

02:07.011 --> 02:09.283
Had kind of a rough one last night, Dot.

02:10.139 --> 02:12.173
Nothing your award-winning
coffee can't fix.

02:12.917 --> 02:14.449
You're listening to Clifford

02:14.474 --> 02:16.738
and the Ape on Blaster, 109.7.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.073
That's right, Bishop.

02:20.134 --> 02:22.087
Another Harley Carter sighting.

02:22.112 --> 02:24.202
This time at a crime
scene up at High Point.

02:24.227 --> 02:25.260
I mean, come on.

02:25.348 --> 02:26.514
This guy has been pretending

02:26.539 --> 02:28.773
that he's real police for too long.

02:28.948 --> 02:30.749
Mark, you are on the air.

02:30.821 --> 02:32.287
Carter's a disgrace.

02:32.556 --> 02:34.216
A spoiled Hollywood jerk.

02:34.458 --> 02:36.049
He's spitting on the police department

02:36.229 --> 02:37.775
and he's spitting on the taxpayer.

02:37.800 --> 02:40.557
We solved that High Point
case in record time.

02:41.765 --> 02:45.215
The husband was standing over the
wife's body screaming, "I did it."

02:45.856 --> 02:48.204
Well, yeah. Come on.
They can't all be Agatha Christie.

02:48.238 --> 02:50.213
Wh... what are you listening
to this crap for anyway?

02:50.237 --> 02:52.815
I'm waiting for the
rock trivia contests.

02:52.969 --> 02:55.244
Liar. Name one rock band.

02:55.758 --> 02:57.600
- The Beatles.
- Name one more.

02:58.515 --> 03:00.295
Phantom of the Opera.

03:01.368 --> 03:03.477
She likes to listen to
what they say about you.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.610
You have to know your enemies.

03:05.688 --> 03:07.390
Dot, I don't have any enemies.

03:08.118 --> 03:09.125
Hey, Ape,

03:09.159 --> 03:11.720
what's the name of that
smokestack partner he's got?

03:11.745 --> 03:13.972
Detective Sam Shaw.

03:13.997 --> 03:16.514
Okay, so let me get this straight.
He leaves his wife

03:16.539 --> 03:18.880
so he can hop into a squad
car for some hot fuzz.

03:18.905 --> 03:20.470
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Did I call that?

03:20.504 --> 03:22.916
Did they just say that I
left my wife to be with Sam?

03:22.941 --> 03:23.957
Hold on, Clifford.

03:24.274 --> 03:25.308
We have another caller.

03:25.509 --> 03:28.072
It's Harley Carter's agent!

03:28.278 --> 03:29.674
Okay. Hey, guys.

03:29.699 --> 03:31.932
I know you're having your fun.

03:32.072 --> 03:34.750
But I know Detective Shaw,
and her and Harley's relationship

03:34.785 --> 03:36.156
is strictly professional.

03:36.524 --> 03:38.492
Didn't they grow up together?

03:38.578 --> 03:40.139
Well, yeah.

03:40.164 --> 03:41.324
Harley left Hollywood.

03:41.522 --> 03:42.992
No, no. He is on hiatus.

03:43.194 --> 03:47.044
To solve crimes with his
childhood friend, Sam Shaw.

03:47.297 --> 03:50.019
Who just happens to be the
hottest woman in Bishop.

03:50.044 --> 03:51.408
- Vijay, Vijay, don't.
- Never married...

03:51.432 --> 03:52.702
- Vijay.
- No steady guy.

03:52.736 --> 03:54.103
Maybe she's just waiting

03:54.137 --> 03:56.005
for her childhood
sweetheart to come home.

03:56.039 --> 03:57.673
No, they are not sweethearts!

03:57.946 --> 03:59.509
Vijay, Vijay, shut up!

03:59.792 --> 04:01.844
So they hate each other's guts?

04:02.078 --> 04:03.690
Of course not.
They... they love each other...

04:03.714 --> 04:05.407
They love each other!

04:05.432 --> 04:06.482
Oh, no!

04:06.517 --> 04:08.946
No... no, they love each other like
friends, like... like friends.

04:08.970 --> 04:10.259
You heard it here first!

04:10.284 --> 04:13.742
It's a Blaster 109.7 exclusive!

04:14.747 --> 04:15.763
Where is he?

04:15.788 --> 04:17.303
- Where is he?
- I can see him.

04:18.886 --> 04:20.704
Now would be the chance to fire him.

04:20.730 --> 04:21.862
I'm not gonna fire him.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.230
You should at least make him cry.

04:23.331 --> 04:24.768
That's your job, Dot.

04:28.315 --> 04:29.378
Wh...

04:29.701 --> 04:30.901
What are you doing?!

04:31.241 --> 04:32.875
I was trying to run damage control.

04:32.909 --> 04:35.791
Don't run damage control
by causing more damage!

04:35.867 --> 04:36.909
You know what? I'll fix it.

04:36.933 --> 04:38.682
No, you won't, okay? Just let it die.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.416
They'll move onto something else.
They always do.

04:40.440 --> 04:42.080
Do you think Detective
Shaw was listening?

04:42.603 --> 04:44.485
Let's hope, for our sakes, she was not.

04:45.048 --> 04:46.782
- I'll call her.
- No, you won't.

04:47.487 --> 04:49.531
I'm confiscating this
as a dangerous weapon.

04:54.718 --> 04:57.019
Oh!

04:57.044 --> 04:59.140
Hey, you remember back in high school

04:59.165 --> 05:02.401
you used to read all those
books about interpreting dreams

05:02.572 --> 05:04.652
because you kept having that
one recurring nightmare?

05:04.877 --> 05:06.253
Oh, God, yeah.

05:06.278 --> 05:07.902
The one where I had to go
to the bathroom real bad.

05:07.926 --> 05:09.067
Yeah, that's it, yeah!

05:09.092 --> 05:10.939
And there was only one toilet
and it was out in the open.

05:10.963 --> 05:12.237
Right, I remember now.

05:12.415 --> 05:13.526
The middle of the gym.

05:13.950 --> 05:15.104
Okay, I got it.

05:15.129 --> 05:16.163
During a pep rally.

05:16.376 --> 05:18.255
Again, I remember.

05:19.062 --> 05:20.278
What did that dream mean?

05:21.607 --> 05:24.108
Something about my inability
to express my emotions.

05:25.239 --> 05:27.653
R-really? Wh... what
does that have to do

05:27.678 --> 05:29.403
with going pee in public?

05:29.428 --> 05:30.988
You know what? Just... just never mind.

05:31.355 --> 05:32.955
What does it mean if you have a dream

05:32.980 --> 05:36.128
where your friend gets killed
and it's kind of your fault?

05:36.404 --> 05:38.038
That means that you're
trying to kill off

05:38.063 --> 05:39.711
an unnecessary part of yourself.

05:40.480 --> 05:41.547
Really?

05:42.145 --> 05:43.297
No!

05:43.417 --> 05:45.597
Dream interpretation is junk.
It doesn't mean anything.

05:45.622 --> 05:47.081
It just means what you want it to.

05:47.174 --> 05:48.190
Who died?

05:48.827 --> 05:49.908
You.

05:50.497 --> 05:51.558
Me?

05:52.882 --> 05:54.354
Okay, then it definitely
means something.

05:54.378 --> 05:55.567
What? What does it mean? Tell me!

05:55.591 --> 05:57.483
Nothing! Oh, my God.

05:57.671 --> 05:58.741
Wait, unless...

05:59.750 --> 06:00.825
Do you want to kill me?

06:01.795 --> 06:02.801
No.

06:02.943 --> 06:04.343
Then it doesn't mean anything.

06:04.434 --> 06:06.907
Thanks, Dave. You're a real help.
You're a real straight shooter.

06:06.931 --> 06:08.274
That's why I come to you.

06:17.681 --> 06:18.858
Knock, knock!

06:19.514 --> 06:20.659
What are you doing here?

06:20.684 --> 06:21.968
We don't have any open cases.

06:22.499 --> 06:24.602
Just, uh, seeing if you needed a hand.

06:24.888 --> 06:27.296
Well, I've got two court appearances.

06:27.321 --> 06:28.491
In the next three weeks,

06:28.525 --> 06:30.819
I have to tag 57 exhibits

06:30.844 --> 06:33.625
and cross-reference my notes
and prep for the prosecution.

06:34.500 --> 06:37.164
Okay, well, uh,
seems like you got a handle on it.

06:39.839 --> 06:41.170
What's on your mind, Harley?

06:42.558 --> 06:45.641
Um, I-I-I was just wondering if,
um, you know that gym

06:45.676 --> 06:47.810
that you're always, um,
you're always sparring at?

06:47.844 --> 06:50.680
I-I was just wondering if you were,
um, there this morning.

06:51.505 --> 06:52.815
Mm-hmm.

06:53.778 --> 06:54.911
Okay.

06:57.089 --> 06:59.288
Do you want to know if I
was listening to the radio

06:59.322 --> 07:00.597
while I was doing my sparring?

07:01.479 --> 07:02.722
No, no.

07:03.026 --> 07:04.065
Nah.

07:04.594 --> 07:07.497
Or if I heard your agent
talking to Clifford and the Ape?

07:08.005 --> 07:10.231
Oh, he... he was on... he was on there?

07:11.177 --> 07:13.362
Do I look like I care

07:13.387 --> 07:15.504
what some idiot says
about me on the radio?

07:15.529 --> 07:16.896
Look, Vijay meant well.

07:16.966 --> 07:18.708
No, I'm talking about
those other two jerks.

07:18.742 --> 07:20.585
Please, it's background noise.

07:20.877 --> 07:23.045
Besides, "smokestack partner."

07:23.080 --> 07:24.732
I mean, there are worse
things I could be called.

07:24.756 --> 07:27.439
Yeah, but you... You're not upset
about the other stuff that they said?

07:27.463 --> 07:28.487
Detective!

07:28.719 --> 07:30.026
Something's going on.

07:31.254 --> 07:32.574
What the hell are you doing, man?!

07:32.598 --> 07:33.832
Clifford, are you okay?!

07:33.857 --> 07:35.191
Get off me, you maniac!

07:35.225 --> 07:36.347
Say something if you're okay!

07:36.371 --> 07:37.737
This has gotta be one of their pranks,
right?

07:37.761 --> 07:39.839
- I don't know... shh, shh.
- Put that down!

07:41.700 --> 07:43.535
Oh, my God! Clifford!

07:43.821 --> 07:45.381
Did we just hear what I think we heard?

07:54.981 --> 07:57.231
- Where's the booth?
- Oh, it's... It's right over there!

07:57.346 --> 07:58.379
Are you the cops?

07:58.404 --> 08:00.057
- Where's Clifford?
- What are you doing here?

08:00.081 --> 08:02.025
- He's at his house!
- But he was attacked on air.

08:02.214 --> 08:03.948
He broadcasts from his home studio.

08:03.991 --> 08:05.503
Whoever attacked him did it there!

08:05.528 --> 08:07.331
He must be in trouble.
He's not answering his phone.

08:07.355 --> 08:09.217
Well, what about his
partner, the Ape? Where is he?

08:09.241 --> 08:11.202
I'm the Ape! We've gotta go!

08:11.273 --> 08:14.155
Leave it to the police, Mr. Ape.

08:27.611 --> 08:29.558
Okay, you go around back
and I'll take the front.

08:29.913 --> 08:30.947
Sam!

08:31.572 --> 08:33.681
Put your hands up! Do it, now.

08:33.727 --> 08:36.205
- I didn't do anything.
- Where is Clifford Branly?

08:36.438 --> 08:38.525
- I don't know!
- All right, get her in the car.

08:38.655 --> 08:40.486
- Keep an eye on her. You're with me.

09:37.594 --> 09:38.613
Nobody's downstairs.

09:38.638 --> 09:39.870
Yup, nobody up here, either.

09:40.483 --> 09:42.105
Well, what do you mean?

09:42.817 --> 09:44.046
Isn't this his studio?

09:44.071 --> 09:46.531
Looks like, but if he was attacked here,
where's the body?

09:53.620 --> 09:55.697
The door was open when I got here.

09:55.918 --> 09:58.190
I called out. Nobody answered, so,

09:58.535 --> 10:00.025
you know, I-I went in.

10:00.318 --> 10:01.527
How do you know Mr. Branly?

10:02.208 --> 10:04.122
Oh, I don't. I don't know Clifford.

10:04.419 --> 10:05.441
Not really.

10:05.466 --> 10:07.063
Well, then, what were you doing here?

10:07.858 --> 10:11.243
He asked me to come here
to say he was sorry.

10:11.766 --> 10:12.766
What for?

10:12.977 --> 10:16.542
Uh... uh, it was like,
this stupid thing three years ago.

10:16.684 --> 10:19.378
Clifford and the Ape took an
inappropriate picture of me

10:19.412 --> 10:20.564
at the Blaster Beach Bash.

10:20.780 --> 10:22.181
They posted it up online.

10:22.689 --> 10:23.715
It wasn't a big deal.

10:23.750 --> 10:25.417
I was... I was surprised that he called.

10:25.657 --> 10:27.886
What is the Blaster Beach Bash?

10:27.921 --> 10:29.569
Oh, it's a bunch of idiots

10:29.594 --> 10:31.256
trying to turn Bishop
into Daytona Beach.

10:31.291 --> 10:32.858
Oh, I've been to the real thing.

10:33.768 --> 10:35.299
It's... pretty cool there
if you can get over the fact

10:35.323 --> 10:37.542
that every grain of
sand smells like urine.

10:37.929 --> 10:38.997
Detective.

10:39.032 --> 10:40.140
- Yeah?
- Yeah?

10:40.733 --> 10:42.024
We're ready for you.

10:42.998 --> 10:45.357
Okay, uh, we may need to ask
you a few more questions.

10:45.453 --> 10:46.517
Of course.

10:55.976 --> 10:57.176
Tell me what you see.

10:57.279 --> 10:59.003
What, something on the carpet?

10:59.303 --> 11:01.261
It's what's not here that's interesting.

11:02.675 --> 11:04.029
I found these fibers tangled up

11:04.057 --> 11:05.554
in the wheels of that office chair,

11:05.725 --> 11:08.060
and judging by the colours and quality,

11:08.094 --> 11:09.781
I'm betting there was another rug here.

11:10.426 --> 11:12.397
Perfect for rolling up a body.

11:12.432 --> 11:13.704
You show me a bloody carpet

11:13.729 --> 11:15.689
and I can tell you if it
used to be on this floor.

11:15.764 --> 11:17.017
And you didn't find any blood?

11:17.270 --> 11:18.673
Not yet. We're still looking.

11:18.698 --> 11:20.253
Great, let me know what you find.

11:20.640 --> 11:22.867
It sounded like he got hit
pretty hard on the radio.

11:24.577 --> 11:27.685
But we have no proof that the
assault actually happened.

11:27.710 --> 11:29.084
Yeah, it could have been a prank.

11:29.170 --> 11:31.155
Which would explain why
there was no body,

11:31.317 --> 11:32.998
a bunch of things knocked over,

11:33.069 --> 11:35.683
a missing carpet to make it
look good, but no blood.

11:36.474 --> 11:37.581
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

11:37.853 --> 11:38.894
Hey, uh, Wes.

11:38.919 --> 11:43.104
Let me see your, um, uh, uh...
flashlight.

11:43.129 --> 11:44.154
Where's your kit?

11:44.496 --> 11:46.080
Oh, yeah. Here we go.

11:47.267 --> 11:48.467
Put that back, okay?

11:48.501 --> 11:49.645
- That's property of the...
- Oh, yeah.

11:49.669 --> 11:51.800
There we go. There we go.
Castoff patterns.

11:51.825 --> 11:53.637
Tough to see, but they are there! Look!

11:54.051 --> 11:55.762
That could be anything.

11:56.594 --> 11:58.997
Um, including castoff patterns.

11:59.177 --> 12:00.247
What are you thinking?

12:00.272 --> 12:02.070
All right, we heard four
blows on the radio.

12:02.095 --> 12:03.328
The first one, the guy hits the floor.

12:03.352 --> 12:05.047
The next three,
the killer brings their arm up,

12:05.071 --> 12:07.270
flicking blood on the ceiling.

12:07.413 --> 12:10.382
Three distinct, medium
velocity patterns,

12:10.461 --> 12:12.262
tails pointing away from the source.

12:12.924 --> 12:14.375
But we don't even know if that's blood.

12:14.399 --> 12:16.100
Anybody using Google could figure out

12:16.125 --> 12:17.358
how to fake those patterns.

12:17.383 --> 12:19.842
Okay, for now, we have two prongs.

12:20.159 --> 12:22.827
One, we are treating this as
a suspicious disappearance.

12:23.128 --> 12:24.528
Two, an idiotic prank.

12:24.553 --> 12:26.453
- And we will...
- Take a closer look.

12:26.478 --> 12:27.511
- Of course.
- Okay.

12:27.536 --> 12:29.315
Let me know what you find.

12:30.914 --> 12:31.947
Oh, yeah.

12:32.463 --> 12:34.807
What, did you binge-watch
Forensic Files?

12:34.923 --> 12:38.968
No, Principles of A Crime Scene
Reconstruction, 3rd Edition.

12:39.378 --> 12:40.545
I got it on Amazon.

12:40.570 --> 12:42.322
All right, here you go.

12:42.346 --> 12:43.622
Okay, thank you.

12:43.647 --> 12:45.728
I got it. I'll take it. Thank you.

12:49.896 --> 12:51.906
Clifford Branly, 42 years old.

12:51.931 --> 12:54.466
Graduated from Ryerson journalism, 1996.

12:54.701 --> 12:58.324
Worked at various newspapers
until he got into radio in 2005.

12:58.582 --> 13:00.138
Came to Bishop in 2012.

13:00.173 --> 13:02.635
No wife, no children,
no relationship that we know of.

13:02.660 --> 13:04.019
Uh, most of his family is out west

13:04.043 --> 13:05.772
and haven't talked to
him for several years.

13:05.797 --> 13:07.197
He is currently considered missing.

13:07.529 --> 13:08.615
Have you canvassed?

13:08.873 --> 13:11.583
Yes, we have his description
out to all the motels,

13:11.617 --> 13:12.951
hotels and restaurants.

13:12.985 --> 13:14.653
If he checks in, we'll know it.

13:14.871 --> 13:16.288
If this is a joke, I don't get it.

13:16.322 --> 13:17.656
These muttonheads on the radio

13:17.681 --> 13:19.041
will do anything to get attention.

13:19.362 --> 13:20.759
If it is the real deal,

13:20.793 --> 13:23.122
whoever did this knew that he
broadcast out of his house.

13:23.147 --> 13:24.920
We should be looking
at station employees.

13:25.131 --> 13:28.007
Yeah, about that.
Uh, we need to tread lightly.

13:28.201 --> 13:29.218
Why?

13:29.368 --> 13:30.538
John Diamond.

13:30.771 --> 13:33.181
He owns the radio station.
He owns the golf course.

13:33.206 --> 13:35.424
He owns the gravel pits outside of town.

13:35.838 --> 13:38.580
And, uh, he's also the mayor's husband.

13:40.085 --> 13:41.151
Right.

13:41.783 --> 13:43.597
And I'm just gonna cut
to the chase here folks

13:43.622 --> 13:45.290
Nobody at the station,

13:45.315 --> 13:47.094
not me, not any of the employees

13:47.119 --> 13:48.854
knows anything about what's going on.

13:48.955 --> 13:51.923
If you don't mind, I prefer to
do my job myself, Mr. Diamond.

13:51.958 --> 13:53.699
I'm, you know, a little funny that way.

13:54.945 --> 13:56.446
So, you know Clifford.

13:56.996 --> 13:59.030
What's your opinion? Is this a stunt?

13:59.065 --> 14:00.193
Maybe.

14:00.246 --> 14:01.669
If it is, it's too far.

14:02.109 --> 14:04.510
It's a black eye on Bishop
and I don't need the headache.

14:04.862 --> 14:06.137
Yeah, neither does your wife.

14:06.253 --> 14:08.869
Grace has never put her
nose in my business.

14:09.924 --> 14:11.377
I don't know how you two do it.

14:12.213 --> 14:13.295
Do what?

14:14.398 --> 14:16.826
Juggle the work relationship
with the other thing.

14:17.162 --> 14:18.783
No, there is no other thing.

14:19.068 --> 14:21.849
Yeah, we... we do it by not doing it.

14:22.521 --> 14:24.256
Mm-hmm. Okay, sorry.

14:24.539 --> 14:25.640
Just not what I heard.

14:26.759 --> 14:29.160
Well, you of all people
should know you can't believe

14:29.195 --> 14:30.525
everything you hear on the radio.

14:31.330 --> 14:32.736
So, Clifford.

14:32.761 --> 14:35.462
Was there any bad blood between
him and others at the station?

14:35.790 --> 14:37.901
Clifford has a way of getting
under everybody's skin.

14:37.980 --> 14:39.247
That's why we're so popular.

14:39.272 --> 14:40.432
That's why people tune in.

14:41.440 --> 14:42.507
What about the listeners?

14:42.541 --> 14:44.309
He had a habit of rubbing
them the wrong way.

14:44.429 --> 14:45.462
Sure.

14:45.912 --> 14:48.013
We get all sorts of nut-job callers.

14:48.681 --> 14:50.181
Do you keep track of those?

14:50.258 --> 14:51.459
Well, everything's recorded.

14:51.484 --> 14:52.673
We've got a whole library of

14:52.698 --> 14:54.898
"Clifford should be off the
air permanently" type calls.

14:56.572 --> 14:58.539
<i>♪ Close. Hold me close ♪</i>

14:58.661 --> 15:01.062
<i>♪ Hold me close 'cause I love you ♪</i>

15:01.128 --> 15:04.295
All right, it's time for
another traffic update.

15:04.320 --> 15:08.600
Let's go to Terry Tanliff in
the Blaster One traffic chopper.

15:09.763 --> 15:11.446
Okay,
thanks a lot, Nigel.

15:11.470 --> 15:14.472
Yeah, we've got a snarl on Highway 22,

15:14.507 --> 15:16.726
uh, just south of the Matooah Bridge.

15:17.035 --> 15:18.554
Expect delays.

15:18.913 --> 15:20.858
Well, thanks a lot there, Terry.

15:21.147 --> 15:24.441
Now it's time for a
blast of Blaster News.

15:27.764 --> 15:29.531
So, there's no actual chopper.

15:29.721 --> 15:32.864
Yeah, but some folks claim
they have seen it in the air.

15:33.280 --> 15:34.973
People believe what they wanna believe.

15:35.085 --> 15:37.218
Hmm. So, how's the case going?

15:37.452 --> 15:39.802
No body. But a lot of suspects.

15:40.357 --> 15:42.771
- Well, that's Clifford.
- Is this a prank?

15:43.102 --> 15:45.303
Well, if it is, I'd like to kick his ass

15:45.338 --> 15:46.512
for not letting me in on it.

15:46.772 --> 15:48.673
I mean, everyone in town
is paying attention.

15:48.759 --> 15:49.923
You don't seem too worried.

15:49.948 --> 15:52.586
Well, people have been
threatening Clifford for years.

15:52.811 --> 15:55.163
- And nothing's happened yet.
- So, Mr. Diamond said

15:55.188 --> 15:57.702
that you keep tapes of some
of these threatening calls?

15:57.783 --> 16:00.706
Oh, oh, yeah. How far
back do you wanna go?

16:01.072 --> 16:02.080
Let's go back a month.

16:02.799 --> 16:03.823
All right.

16:03.848 --> 16:04.893
Let's see.

16:05.151 --> 16:06.161
Oh.

16:06.293 --> 16:08.461
Oh, yeah, this guy.

16:08.761 --> 16:10.373
Yeah, he was a piece of work.

16:10.662 --> 16:12.115
He was a big fan of yours, though.

16:14.185 --> 16:15.703
Harley Carter is a genius

16:15.728 --> 16:18.099
- and a bright shining supernova.
- Hmm, yeah.

16:18.124 --> 16:19.504
He's giving back to the community.

16:19.529 --> 16:21.138
You couldn't lick Harley Carter's shoes.

16:21.165 --> 16:22.173
Sure I can.

16:22.198 --> 16:23.743
I'm licking one right
now like a Popsicle.

16:23.767 --> 16:26.104
I bet you want the other one.

16:26.129 --> 16:28.172
It's not gonna be so funny
when I pull your tongue out.

16:28.196 --> 16:29.758
How you gonna do that, tough guy?

16:29.782 --> 16:31.513
I'm gonna put your head in a vice,

16:31.538 --> 16:32.705
pry your jaws open

16:32.730 --> 16:34.127
with a stainless steel ruler,

16:34.152 --> 16:36.580
and use slip-joint pliers to rip it out.

16:36.650 --> 16:38.033
If you see a van on the street,

16:38.058 --> 16:39.752
that will be me, waiting for you.

16:40.534 --> 16:41.892
You didn't report that?

16:42.015 --> 16:43.658
We get these all the time.

16:44.195 --> 16:46.121
It would take a full-time
cop to handle them all.

16:48.113 --> 16:49.944
Yeah, well, it's different now.

16:50.464 --> 16:51.858
I'm sorry, we... we have to go.

16:51.905 --> 16:53.194
Thank you for your time.

16:57.464 --> 16:59.035
Okay, and that's how he was found?

17:00.456 --> 17:01.501
Yup.

17:11.089 --> 17:14.159
Couple of teenage lovebirds
saw the body wash up.

17:14.675 --> 17:16.153
Evidently, it ruined the mood.

17:16.442 --> 17:19.924
My guess is the body got
dumped in the lake.

17:20.971 --> 17:23.832
Whatever was anchoring
it down broke off,

17:24.000 --> 17:25.199
and the body washed up.

17:32.278 --> 17:34.279
Blunt force trauma,
just like you thought.

17:37.161 --> 17:38.193
You okay?

17:39.920 --> 17:41.715
It reminds me of the dream I just had.

17:51.825 --> 17:53.532
The blood on the studio ceiling

17:53.556 --> 17:54.749
was confirmed as Clifford's.

17:54.837 --> 17:56.384
So he was killed there and then moved.

17:56.718 --> 17:58.135
Any signs of a murder weapon?

17:58.160 --> 18:00.000
There was a trophy missing
from the trophy case.

18:00.024 --> 18:01.541
It was heavy enough and close at hand,

18:01.565 --> 18:02.759
but we have not found it yet.

18:02.784 --> 18:04.666
- It's right here.
- Suspects?

18:04.992 --> 18:07.815
Just a threatening voice on
the radio that thinks, uh,

18:07.896 --> 18:09.250
Harley is a supernova.

18:09.561 --> 18:10.695
What about you, Carter?

18:10.897 --> 18:13.376
No, uh, crazy theories
from season three,

18:13.401 --> 18:14.957
episode 11 of your show?

18:15.588 --> 18:17.545
Uh, that ep was about horse thieves.

18:18.709 --> 18:20.207
Is he even paying attention anymore?

18:20.242 --> 18:21.329
Harley, what are you doing?

18:21.910 --> 18:25.579
I am checking out some
Call Carter fan pages.

18:25.658 --> 18:26.847
Oh, don't let us disturb you.

18:26.882 --> 18:29.284
We'll just move our murder
investigation into another room.

18:29.309 --> 18:32.169
Oh, here it is!
"Bright and shining supernova."

18:32.720 --> 18:34.351
It's amazing. It's like
we're not even here.

18:34.375 --> 18:36.076
No, that's exactly what the caller said

18:36.101 --> 18:37.414
before he threatened Clifford.

18:37.444 --> 18:40.179
He posted a comment on
a Call Carter fan site.

18:40.204 --> 18:42.014
"Harley, you are the moon,
the stars and the sun.

18:42.038 --> 18:44.539
You are a bright and
shining supernova."

18:44.849 --> 18:46.056
And he lives in Bishop.

18:46.110 --> 18:47.424
It's signed "Free Wheeler."

18:47.467 --> 18:48.867
Get that post traced.

18:48.934 --> 18:50.043
- Get an address.
- Yeah.

18:50.863 --> 18:51.950
Good work.

18:54.645 --> 18:56.431
It's a good thing I
read my own comments.

19:04.323 --> 19:06.203
Sam, I know you said

19:06.228 --> 19:08.125
these morning show jocks
don't bother you,

19:08.150 --> 19:10.780
but what about EMT Rick, your boyfriend?

19:10.805 --> 19:12.046
He's kind of a big guy.

19:12.071 --> 19:13.539
Well, Rick and I broke up.

19:13.625 --> 19:15.159
From the morning show thing?

19:15.365 --> 19:17.230
No, it was many different
reasons, Harley,

19:17.255 --> 19:18.394
but none of them were you.

19:19.201 --> 19:20.668
Well, why didn't you tell me?

19:21.836 --> 19:24.372
Well, because, for one, you never asked,

19:24.397 --> 19:26.895
and two, we don't talk about that
kind of stuff. We never have.

19:26.920 --> 19:28.081
Yeah, we do!

19:28.276 --> 19:30.659
Name one time you've ever talked to me

19:30.684 --> 19:31.941
about somebody you were dating.

19:31.966 --> 19:35.371
Uh, name one time you've
ever told me about a new guy.

19:35.558 --> 19:37.075
You just proved my point.

19:38.097 --> 19:39.109
Now, tell me,

19:39.134 --> 19:42.273
does this van look like it would
be good for transporting a body?

19:53.587 --> 19:55.613
Ma'am, I'm here for Jeremy VanSloot.

19:55.638 --> 19:56.723
Is he home?

19:57.207 --> 19:58.277
You got a warrant?

19:58.828 --> 20:00.109
We... we just wanna talk to him.

20:00.782 --> 20:02.249
Well, what if he doesn't wanna talk?

20:02.533 --> 20:03.753
Well, this is the easy way.

20:03.931 --> 20:04.999
You want the hard way,

20:05.024 --> 20:06.638
there are a bunch more of
us down at the station.

20:06.662 --> 20:08.383
I could come back with
them and the warrant.

20:10.424 --> 20:12.367
- Back room.
- Thank you.

20:16.625 --> 20:18.228
Where are you going, buddy, huh?

20:18.253 --> 20:19.653
Huh, come, you think you got me?

20:19.804 --> 20:21.737
You can't get me. Come on, come on, huh?

20:21.835 --> 20:24.284
Yeah, there he is, okay.

20:25.281 --> 20:26.448
Round two, huh?

20:26.473 --> 20:27.773
Jeremy VanSloot?

20:29.069 --> 20:31.009
Come on, let's go.

20:36.859 --> 20:37.873
Wow!

20:40.035 --> 20:41.580
You're even better-looking in person.

20:42.419 --> 20:45.187
And you are not quite what we pictured.

20:46.384 --> 20:48.819
I have a tattoo of your
face on my lower back.

20:49.213 --> 20:50.219
You wanna see it?

20:50.244 --> 20:51.313
Uh, firstly, no.

20:51.338 --> 20:54.453
Secondly, I'm questioning
your placement.

20:54.871 --> 20:57.991
Third of all, let's focus on
the police detective in the room

20:58.016 --> 20:59.285
who is about to arrest you.

20:59.405 --> 21:02.355
What you said on the radio
about Clifford was illegal.

21:02.380 --> 21:04.301
- You know that.
- It was a joke.

21:04.933 --> 21:05.966
Pretty funny, right?

21:06.166 --> 21:07.366
Your punchline was threatening

21:07.391 --> 21:09.168
to pull his tongue out with pliers.

21:11.877 --> 21:14.262
Yeah, totally made everyone flip out.

21:15.045 --> 21:17.780
Facebook and Twitter lit up,
man, it was hilarious!

21:17.839 --> 21:18.910
A scream.

21:18.988 --> 21:20.920
Also a criminal offence.

21:21.135 --> 21:22.469
Is that your van outside?

21:23.552 --> 21:25.395
Bro, totally tricked out.

21:25.485 --> 21:26.966
Got the levers for the gas and brake.

21:27.936 --> 21:28.967
Do you want to go for a ride with me?

21:28.991 --> 21:31.259
What is that program?
Can anyone download it?

21:31.284 --> 21:33.319
- Yeah, yeah.
- Did you go to Clifford's house?

21:37.003 --> 21:38.540
Well, he wouldn't stop slagging you,

21:38.565 --> 21:40.485
so I decided to scare him a little,
you know?

21:40.615 --> 21:42.883
I went at night, parked
under a street lamp

21:42.908 --> 21:44.508
and revved the engine a couple of times.

21:46.007 --> 21:47.441
It was for you, bro.

21:47.749 --> 21:48.824
Okay, new directive.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.636
Next time you wanna do something for me,

21:50.661 --> 21:52.359
just go make me a sandwich.

21:52.497 --> 21:53.555
What kind? You got it.

21:54.608 --> 21:56.094
Did you see Clifford?

21:56.770 --> 21:59.306
Yeah, some chick came.
She was pretty hot, actually.

21:59.407 --> 22:00.697
He let her in, and then I left.

22:01.610 --> 22:03.244
The night before he was attacked?

22:03.919 --> 22:04.956
Yeah.

22:07.142 --> 22:08.183
Are you okay?

22:08.237 --> 22:11.430
I guess. I've just never been
involved with anything like this.

22:11.551 --> 22:13.205
Hey, um, can you tell us a little more

22:13.230 --> 22:15.182
about this Beach Bash thing?

22:16.506 --> 22:19.441
The, uh, reason Clifford
wanted to apologize?

22:19.915 --> 22:21.147
I was wearing a white t-shirt

22:21.172 --> 22:22.748
and they sprayed me with a water gun.

22:23.244 --> 22:25.568
The picture they took went viral,
super fast.

22:25.793 --> 22:29.262
So, if that was three years ago,
then you would have been...

22:29.287 --> 22:30.322
17.

22:30.729 --> 22:32.876
Yeah, my parents freaked.

22:32.901 --> 22:34.768
They took me out of school,

22:35.010 --> 22:37.071
made me go live in Sudbury
with one of my aunts.

22:37.933 --> 22:39.258
I came back a month ago.

22:39.461 --> 22:41.829
And that's when you
started to see Clifford?

22:41.957 --> 22:42.981
What?

22:43.006 --> 22:45.140
No, that's... that's crazy, I...

22:45.645 --> 22:46.669
You spent the night.

22:46.789 --> 22:47.823
We have a witness.

22:51.016 --> 22:53.651
Okay, fine, but I-I-I wasn't
supposed to be there.

22:53.676 --> 22:54.817
It was just a hook-up.

22:55.402 --> 22:56.614
My dad's gonna lose his mind.

22:56.903 --> 22:58.075
If he hasn't already.

22:58.100 --> 23:00.442
He's suing the station
for the wet t-shirt thing.

23:00.467 --> 23:02.168
If they find out that
I was with Clifford,

23:02.193 --> 23:04.481
then the whole lawsuit's
gonna go out the window.

23:04.571 --> 23:07.770
Why don't you just tell us
what happened inside the house?

23:09.407 --> 23:12.154
You know, we... baked a few cookies.

23:12.890 --> 23:13.935
Oh, yeah.

23:14.576 --> 23:16.410
You mean, uh, smoking the drugs?

23:17.466 --> 23:18.559
Intercourse.

23:19.542 --> 23:20.743
Are you kidding me?

23:20.768 --> 23:22.489
Baking cookies means doing it?

23:22.514 --> 23:23.544
That... no, no, no.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.094
What you... what? You mix the dough.

23:25.119 --> 23:26.515
Not sexual. You knead the dough.

23:26.540 --> 23:27.914
That is, I guess, vaguely...

23:27.939 --> 23:29.094
So, then what happened?

23:29.344 --> 23:30.743
Um...

23:31.184 --> 23:32.651
Clifford gets all weird.

23:32.819 --> 23:34.627
He pulls out two tickets
to New York City.

23:34.652 --> 23:36.604
He says, "Let's go on an adventure."

23:36.629 --> 23:38.797
So I'm like, "Sure, whatever."

23:39.097 --> 23:42.266
I go back to my place and I
grab my passport and my clothes.

23:43.168 --> 23:45.135
You can check the cameras
in my parking garage.

23:45.160 --> 23:46.182
We will.

23:46.535 --> 23:47.565
Is that it?

23:48.726 --> 23:49.729
You tell me.

23:50.435 --> 23:51.471
Yeah.

23:52.904 --> 23:54.245
Except for the phone call.

23:55.151 --> 23:56.351
What phone call?

23:56.683 --> 23:57.825
As I was leaving,

23:57.913 --> 24:00.180
Clifford was on the phone
yelling at some guy,

24:00.215 --> 24:02.549
telling him to go 'F'
himself and stuff like that.

24:03.144 --> 24:04.457
And stuff like that.

24:05.308 --> 24:07.631
All I can remember is Clifford
saying something like,

24:08.123 --> 24:09.381
"You can't threaten me anymore.

24:09.657 --> 24:10.803
The deal is done."

24:11.163 --> 24:12.889
- What deal?
- I don't know.

24:17.365 --> 24:21.468
Rafalski, what does the term
'baking cookies' mean to you?

24:23.048 --> 24:24.075
It depends.

24:25.074 --> 24:26.094
Depends on what?

24:26.200 --> 24:27.274
Time of day.

24:27.309 --> 24:31.392
I mean, Saturday night
means hot sex, huh?

24:34.364 --> 24:36.383
Wow, I really need to
work on my millennial.

24:36.418 --> 24:37.458
Hey.

24:37.619 --> 24:38.859
I got Clifford's phone records.

24:38.884 --> 24:40.305
There was only phone call

24:40.333 --> 24:42.556
at 11:14pm for 14 minutes, nothing else.

24:42.826 --> 24:44.191
Any name attached to that number?

24:44.225 --> 24:47.027
The owner of The Blaster,
109.7, the mayor's husband.

24:47.248 --> 24:48.285
John Diamond.

24:48.442 --> 24:49.930
Pretty late to be making a work call.

24:50.223 --> 24:52.103
I'll give a shout when I
can him back down here.

24:56.580 --> 24:59.215
So, you figure out why you tried
to kill me in your dream yet?

24:59.430 --> 25:02.302
Yeah, I think it's because you
make an extremely weak cortado.

25:02.567 --> 25:05.036
Oh, remind me to start
charging you for those.

25:05.523 --> 25:06.606
What did Sam say?

25:06.631 --> 25:09.477
Sam said that dreams are just
epiphenomenon, and when we sleep,

25:09.502 --> 25:12.485
our brains become more
imagistic and less linear.

25:12.876 --> 25:15.157
And I'm guessing that's when
you stopped paying attention.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.705
No, I-I actually started to think,

25:16.730 --> 25:18.668
"Is it epiphenomena, epiphenomenon

25:18.693 --> 25:19.726
or epiphenomenons"?

25:19.760 --> 25:20.815
What's the plural of that word?

25:20.839 --> 25:22.117
That's when I really checked out.

25:22.141 --> 25:24.367
Right. Well, uh, duty calls.

25:25.012 --> 25:26.045
Be right with you, folks.

25:26.267 --> 25:27.296
- Oh, okay.
- Vijay.

25:27.635 --> 25:28.915
Ooh, okay,

25:28.940 --> 25:31.408
I had to pull some real long
strings to get you that.

25:31.790 --> 25:33.752
So, uh, can I have my phone back?

25:34.714 --> 25:36.010
Is this what I think it is?

25:36.167 --> 25:38.565
Yep, the reason why Clifford was
so hot to get to New York.

25:39.455 --> 25:40.960
So, about that phone.

25:42.546 --> 25:43.780
Remember what I said.

25:44.174 --> 25:45.817
Keep the weapon holstered, got it,

25:47.618 --> 25:48.810
Oh, I missed you.

25:56.959 --> 25:58.277
Is that your number?

25:59.673 --> 26:00.715
Cell phone.

26:01.912 --> 26:02.950
When we spoke,

26:02.975 --> 26:04.973
you didn't mention that
you had called Clifford.

26:06.507 --> 26:08.641
I call my employees all the time.

26:08.919 --> 26:10.261
It's part of running a business.

26:10.311 --> 26:11.433
Why would I mention it?

26:11.572 --> 26:14.347
A few hours before
Clifford was killed on-air?

26:14.372 --> 26:15.677
You don't think that's relevant?

26:15.847 --> 26:16.864
No.

26:17.060 --> 26:19.528
- What did you talk about?
- We traded Bundt cake recipes.

26:19.888 --> 26:23.821
Oh, no, um,
the kids today call it 'baking cookies.'

26:24.254 --> 26:25.352
I didn't know, either.

26:26.631 --> 26:28.098
We talked business, that's it.

26:28.173 --> 26:30.208
Business that included
threatening Clifford

26:30.233 --> 26:31.800
hours before his murder?

26:31.865 --> 26:33.130
Who told you I threatened him?

26:33.297 --> 26:34.323
A witness.

26:35.836 --> 26:38.222
Hey, how are those, uh,
morning show ratings?

26:38.247 --> 26:39.300
On-air murder?

26:39.325 --> 26:40.925
They've gotta be going through the roof.

26:41.597 --> 26:42.735
So, what... what are you saying?

26:42.759 --> 26:44.627
I'd kill my number one
DJ just so I can charge

26:44.652 --> 26:47.167
Marge's AutoShop an
extra $50 bucks per ad?

26:47.192 --> 26:50.284
Oh, maybe if your number
one DJ was leaving, yeah.

26:50.533 --> 26:52.167
Hey, you know what this is here?

26:52.249 --> 26:53.983
This is Clifford's contract

26:54.025 --> 26:57.828
for a morning spot on
satellite radio in New York.

26:59.692 --> 27:01.326
Your number one DJ leaves,

27:01.664 --> 27:03.765
takes his good ratings with him.

27:03.943 --> 27:05.377
Station takes a huge hit.

27:06.167 --> 27:09.302
I threatened Clifford with a
lawsuit for breach of contract,

27:09.336 --> 27:10.362
not murder.

27:10.478 --> 27:12.171
So why didn't you say
that to begin with?

27:15.827 --> 27:17.569
Because he threatened me back.

27:18.514 --> 27:19.603
And what do you mean?

27:20.460 --> 27:23.071
A few months ago,
we had an employee at the station.

27:23.973 --> 27:27.909
Things got complicated
between her and the boys.

27:29.383 --> 27:30.579
How complicated?

27:30.892 --> 27:32.610
There were allegations of assault,

27:34.495 --> 27:36.454
and instead of taking it to the police,

27:36.479 --> 27:37.907
I made it worth her while to leave.

27:39.374 --> 27:40.937
So you paid her off.

27:45.239 --> 27:46.257
This assault,

27:46.282 --> 27:49.257
was it the sort of thing someone
would wanna get even for?

27:50.010 --> 27:51.600
You should probably ask her that.

27:58.287 --> 28:00.832
Harley. So nice to see you.

28:01.247 --> 28:02.363
Mayor Hamilton.

28:03.153 --> 28:06.029
This investigation,
it's a horrible time for the city.

28:06.331 --> 28:07.623
Was my husband helpful?

28:08.274 --> 28:11.245
Uh... I'm... I'm so sorry, Mayor.

28:11.270 --> 28:12.828
I'm... I'm not really
allowed to talk about that.

28:12.852 --> 28:14.010
Of course.

28:14.282 --> 28:16.650
Can't blame a concerned wife for trying.

28:16.794 --> 28:19.530
Yeah, actually, I might have an idea.

28:20.095 --> 28:22.536
What if, in this case,

28:23.115 --> 28:24.979
you did rely on your celebrity?

28:25.549 --> 28:29.175
What if Harley Carter, Hollywood star,

28:29.711 --> 28:32.409
gets you the clue that might
help you solve the case?

28:35.328 --> 28:37.329
Thanks again, Harley.

28:41.010 --> 28:44.005
Hey. The woman that John paid off,

28:44.030 --> 28:45.266
the one that wants to
sue Clifford and the Ape,

28:45.290 --> 28:46.520
I found out where she works. You coming?

28:46.544 --> 28:47.558
No.

28:48.303 --> 28:50.066
The mayor just gave me a great idea.

28:51.585 --> 28:54.120
Okay, divide and conquer. Let's go.

29:01.772 --> 29:03.772
Good morning Bishop.

29:03.820 --> 29:05.764
Blaster 109.7,

29:05.803 --> 29:07.997
and we've got some
special guests with us

29:08.022 --> 29:11.366
in the studio today.
Harley Carter has joined us.

29:11.522 --> 29:12.549
Hello, hello.

29:12.574 --> 29:15.635
And with Harley is his best friend

29:15.660 --> 29:17.043
and local entrepreneur,

29:17.077 --> 29:18.091
Dave Leigh.

29:19.833 --> 29:22.458
Uh, hey... Bishop.

29:27.608 --> 29:30.361
Nigel, thank you so much
for letting us be here.

29:30.386 --> 29:32.778
As you know, we're working
with the Bishop PD

29:32.803 --> 29:34.966
to try and get Clifford's killer.

29:34.991 --> 29:37.108
Now, if any of your listeners
have any information,

29:37.133 --> 29:38.573
we would love if they would call in.

29:38.881 --> 29:41.384
All right, Bishop. It's up to you.

29:41.409 --> 29:45.158
The phone lines are open.
Let's catch a killer!

29:46.558 --> 29:47.583
Laurel Henzan?

29:49.775 --> 29:50.802
Detective Shaw.

29:50.827 --> 29:52.966
Your supervisor told me I
could find you out here.

29:53.013 --> 29:54.293
I was hoping that we could talk.

29:54.607 --> 29:55.616
Of course.

29:56.278 --> 29:58.012
This is about Clifford's
murder, isn't it?

29:58.231 --> 29:59.254
Yes.

29:59.955 --> 30:01.430
I was wondering when you'd show up.

30:02.106 --> 30:03.737
It was dark, so I can't be sure,

30:04.034 --> 30:06.326
but I'm pretty sure I saw him
put both bodies in a boat.

30:06.360 --> 30:08.546
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did
you say both bodies?

30:08.571 --> 30:09.999
Clifford's body and Harley's body.

30:10.358 --> 30:11.943
Then he rode out into
the middle of the lake.

30:11.967 --> 30:12.975
Hold on a second.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.827
You... you know that I'm
Harley Carter, right?

30:14.852 --> 30:16.313
I'm talking about Harley Carter.

30:16.547 --> 30:18.380
Again, I'm Harley Carter.

30:18.405 --> 30:19.772
Are you calling me a liar?!

30:21.718 --> 30:23.352
Thanks for the call, Allan.

30:23.974 --> 30:26.809
Well, so far we have four mysterious men

30:26.834 --> 30:29.051
and a marriage proposal for Harley.

30:29.076 --> 30:31.076
Yeah, thanks, Bishop.
Let's keep those calls coming in.

30:31.100 --> 30:32.650
We'll be right back.

30:34.655 --> 30:36.389
You know, you could...
could say something.

30:36.423 --> 30:38.462
Yeah, well,
maybe if I got a marriage proposal,

30:38.487 --> 30:39.688
- I'd have something to say.
- Yeah, well,

30:39.712 --> 30:40.737
all you've said so far is,

30:40.761 --> 30:43.029
"Uh, hello, uh, Bishop."

30:43.063 --> 30:44.575
You know what? Maybe I'm nervous.

30:44.600 --> 30:47.270
You're the star, all right?
I'm just here to support.

30:49.673 --> 30:52.205
Hey, what are all those tapes for?

30:52.379 --> 30:55.550
Everything I need for
the show is in here...

30:55.575 --> 30:56.755
Commercials,

30:56.995 --> 30:58.645
pre-taped bits, sound effects.

30:58.812 --> 31:00.013
You take them home with you?

31:00.118 --> 31:02.177
Yeah, the no-talents around here

31:02.202 --> 31:04.607
would steal all my best material
if I gave them a chance.

31:04.855 --> 31:07.690
Everything you hear in this show,
all the ideas,

31:07.763 --> 31:10.454
Clifford's best lines, I wrote it all.

31:11.253 --> 31:12.853
This stuff is mine.

31:17.801 --> 31:21.403
We went out a couple of times,
and at first, it was great.

31:21.868 --> 31:23.919
He was sweet, charming.

31:24.637 --> 31:26.405
Nothing like what you hear on the radio.

31:26.833 --> 31:30.190
- And then?
- I don't know. I broke it off.

31:31.244 --> 31:32.736
That's when it started.

31:32.761 --> 31:34.611
- What happened?
- Phone calls.

31:35.064 --> 31:37.663
Texts. A lot of them.

31:38.343 --> 31:40.303
And when I ignored them, it got worse.

31:40.387 --> 31:42.670
And is that when the radio
station got involved,

31:42.695 --> 31:44.238
when you threatened to sue Clifford?

31:44.972 --> 31:46.316
This wasn't about him.

31:47.408 --> 31:49.219
It was Nigel who made all the threats.

31:50.051 --> 31:52.821
We're back on Blaster 109.7

31:52.846 --> 31:55.658
with international television star,
Harley Carter

31:55.759 --> 31:59.307
and his friend and
sidekick, barista Dave.

31:59.332 --> 32:00.338
I'm not a sidekick.

32:00.363 --> 32:03.440
Well, you get Harley coffee.
You come running when he calls.

32:03.465 --> 32:04.498
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:04.522 --> 32:06.513
Dave has actually had
a gun pointed at him.

32:06.729 --> 32:08.330
Yeah, on numerous occasions.

32:08.355 --> 32:10.323
He was cattle prodded. Cattle prodded.

32:10.421 --> 32:12.289
I had a cattle prod all over me.

32:12.314 --> 32:13.741
It was like...

32:13.909 --> 32:15.444
He's more than just a sidekick.

32:15.469 --> 32:18.053
Hey, he... he almost got
blown up by a bomb.

32:18.231 --> 32:19.640
Actually, again, that was both of us.

32:19.664 --> 32:21.327
We both almost got blown up by a bomb.

32:21.352 --> 32:22.719
But you, it almost really...

32:22.744 --> 32:24.109
No, but I defused it.

32:24.294 --> 32:25.662
Wow. Well, congratulations.

32:25.859 --> 32:28.976
Your bromance is making me all teary.

32:29.318 --> 32:30.552
You know what I need

32:30.649 --> 32:31.916
is a refreshing dip

32:32.044 --> 32:33.859
back into the pond of our callers.

32:33.922 --> 32:35.602
Actually, I don't think
we have to do that.

32:35.913 --> 32:36.916
Why?

32:37.648 --> 32:39.502
Because I have a pretty good idea

32:40.359 --> 32:41.593
as to who the killer is.

32:43.907 --> 32:46.208
All right, Detective Carter.

32:46.736 --> 32:49.107
- Who did it?
- Someone with the perfect alibi.

32:49.692 --> 32:52.408
Someone who was miles away
when it all went down.

32:53.864 --> 32:54.930
Me?

32:57.522 --> 33:00.239
Thousands of listeners know
where I am every morning

33:00.264 --> 33:02.232
between 6:00 and 10:00am.

33:02.456 --> 33:05.164
They knew the where.
They just didn't know the when.

33:05.987 --> 33:07.476
Let's play the murder again.

33:07.681 --> 33:08.959
What the hell are you doing, man?

33:08.983 --> 33:10.761
Clifford, are you okay?

33:10.786 --> 33:12.219
Get off me, you maniac!

33:12.244 --> 33:13.692
Say something if you're okay!

33:13.717 --> 33:15.551
Clifford, what is happening in there?

33:15.576 --> 33:17.644
Put that down!

33:17.959 --> 33:20.351
Clifford, oh my God! Clifford!

33:21.765 --> 33:23.844
I had my string-pulling
agent call up the airlines.

33:23.869 --> 33:25.714
It turns out Clifford was
supposed to fly to New York

33:25.738 --> 33:27.957
at 10:00am the day he was killed.

33:29.228 --> 33:30.441
He would have missed his show,

33:30.774 --> 33:32.973
but he wanted to do one final broadcast,

33:32.998 --> 33:34.744
his big goodbye to Bishop.

33:35.501 --> 33:38.206
So, Clifford recorded it earlier.

33:38.415 --> 33:39.417
That's right.

33:39.442 --> 33:41.762
There was a missing digital
cassette at Clifford's house...

33:42.628 --> 33:44.665
His recorded part of the show.

33:45.276 --> 33:47.884
You killed Clifford.
You took that digital cassette,

33:47.909 --> 33:50.077
and you edited the whole show together.

33:50.371 --> 33:52.766
He says, "Can I get some advice?"

33:52.791 --> 33:55.393
Here's my advice. Don't do a podcast.

33:55.786 --> 33:57.924
Do something else. Find a better hobby

33:58.076 --> 33:59.838
because I'm telling
you something, not...

34:01.334 --> 34:02.920
What the hell are you doing, man?!

34:03.417 --> 34:05.118
Get off me, you maniac!

34:05.143 --> 34:06.739
Sounds pretty far-fetched to me.

34:07.694 --> 34:11.668
Okay, Clifford kept his
radio awards on his shelf.

34:11.694 --> 34:15.029
Big, heavy things.
I looked it up; he won three.

34:15.630 --> 34:18.507
But there were only two there,
so I'm guessing

34:18.879 --> 34:22.074
it's what's making your bag
pretty heavy right about now.

34:24.136 --> 34:25.810
Put that down!

34:25.835 --> 34:28.429
You cut the murder into the show

34:28.455 --> 34:30.594
to give yourself the perfect alibi.

34:30.762 --> 34:32.129
You even threw in some live calls

34:32.154 --> 34:33.786
to make it sound more authentic.

34:33.906 --> 34:37.076
They love each other!
You heard it here first.

34:37.101 --> 34:40.558
It's a Blaster 109.7 exclusive!

34:41.951 --> 34:43.846
And I'm betting all those live callers,

34:44.030 --> 34:47.719
other than Vijay, were voiced by you.

34:49.007 --> 34:50.579
Carter's a disgrace,

34:50.783 --> 34:52.409
a spoiled Hollywood jerk.

34:52.860 --> 34:54.594
He's spitting on the police department

34:54.620 --> 34:56.331
and he's spitting on the taxpayer.

34:57.325 --> 34:59.381
Wow, that really is the perfect alibi.

34:59.406 --> 35:00.522
You said it yourself.

35:00.843 --> 35:02.978
People believe what they wanna believe.

35:03.576 --> 35:05.043
Theatre of the mind.

35:05.148 --> 35:06.815
Why don't you show us what's in the bag?

35:07.028 --> 35:08.146
Prove us wrong.

35:08.906 --> 35:10.002
All right.

35:18.757 --> 35:19.772
Easy, Nigel.

35:19.797 --> 35:21.564
Ladies and gentlemen,

35:21.998 --> 35:26.086
you are listening to the last
ever episode of the morning show

35:26.269 --> 35:28.738
on Blaster 109.7.

35:29.539 --> 35:31.907
Let's go out with a bang.

35:39.801 --> 35:41.612
Everybody stay where you are!

35:45.057 --> 35:47.766
Lower your weapons or I
shoot him right now!

35:48.469 --> 35:49.727
All right, stand down.

35:52.046 --> 35:54.564
Nigel, there is no way
out of this for you.

35:54.882 --> 35:57.806
Put your gun down and come out.

35:58.553 --> 36:00.850
You know, I think I'm
gonna take a caller.

36:01.983 --> 36:03.804
Tony, you're on.

36:03.941 --> 36:06.609
Shoot him! It'd be so freaking cool.

36:06.682 --> 36:08.116
Why don't you shut up, Tony?

36:08.657 --> 36:09.868
We'll get through this.

36:10.713 --> 36:12.790
Why am I the one who always
has a gun pointed at him?

36:12.814 --> 36:14.257
I was wondering that myself.

36:14.414 --> 36:17.213
It's because nobody cares
about the sidekicks.

36:17.238 --> 36:21.417
Hey! He's not my sidekick.
He's my best friend.

36:21.583 --> 36:24.088
I thought lover girl out
there was your best friend.

36:26.447 --> 36:28.576
I have two. I'm lucky.

36:29.023 --> 36:32.091
Yeah. I thought Clifford
was my best friend,

36:32.420 --> 36:35.621
but when my girlfriend left me,
he wasn't there.

36:36.126 --> 36:37.863
And when he got the offer
to go to New York,

36:38.139 --> 36:40.238
he made sure that I wouldn't come along.

36:40.571 --> 36:44.120
He stole all of my best material
and left me with nothing.

36:44.632 --> 36:47.585
There's no such thing as best
friends with people like you.

36:48.481 --> 36:50.700
You know what?
At the risk of aggravating you,

36:50.733 --> 36:51.858
I have to disagree.

36:51.883 --> 36:53.968
No, no, no, Dave. He's right.

36:54.991 --> 36:56.158
What are you talking about?

36:56.422 --> 36:58.930
People like you, like Clifford,

36:59.672 --> 37:02.396
they don't think about
all the damage they cause

37:02.421 --> 37:03.656
and the lives they ruin.

37:04.819 --> 37:06.086
You're right, Nigel.

37:06.120 --> 37:07.754
People like Clifford and me,

37:07.788 --> 37:09.870
we use our friends to get what we want.

37:10.245 --> 37:12.050
Point that gun at me.

37:12.075 --> 37:14.109
Come on, Nigel, at me. Point it at me.

37:14.253 --> 37:16.354
Nice try. Get up.

37:16.984 --> 37:18.734
Come on, barista boy. Come on.

37:19.511 --> 37:20.523
Nigel.

37:23.631 --> 37:25.256
Oh, God.

37:25.281 --> 37:26.493
You see what he just did right there?

37:26.517 --> 37:27.817
That... that's not good.

37:27.842 --> 37:30.616
Let's go out together. Sidekicks.

37:31.078 --> 37:32.116
Nigel.

37:32.330 --> 37:33.890
Let me just say one last thing to Dave.

37:34.091 --> 37:35.161
Like what?

37:36.231 --> 37:39.090
Call Carter, season 3, episode 11.

37:40.012 --> 37:41.529
Is that the one about the horse thieves?

37:41.553 --> 37:43.434
Yeah, remember how it ends?

37:53.501 --> 37:55.908
What the hell was that move, Harley?
I can't believe it worked!

37:55.932 --> 37:58.344
Told ya, Carter, season 3, episode 11.

37:58.369 --> 37:59.723
I mean, my stuntman did it.
I didn't do it.

37:59.747 --> 38:01.144
I didn't realize it hurt so much.

38:01.169 --> 38:02.970
Get it off, get it off.

38:03.456 --> 38:04.656
Thank you.

38:05.338 --> 38:07.456
Best friends.

38:19.928 --> 38:21.428
♪ Baby, give me that love ♪

38:23.238 --> 38:25.527
Hey, guys. Hi.

38:26.551 --> 38:27.634
Ooh.

38:27.668 --> 38:29.753
Dot, bringing back fondue, nice.

38:29.971 --> 38:31.558
I know it is your favourite.

38:31.596 --> 38:33.760
Oh, yeah, when I was little, for sure.

38:33.785 --> 38:34.877
It's melted cheese on everything.

38:34.901 --> 38:37.163
How could it not be?
Thank you for remembering.

38:37.188 --> 38:38.454
You are welcome.

38:39.647 --> 38:40.751
Do you need help?

38:41.916 --> 38:43.736
Sam, a moment?

38:44.642 --> 38:46.450
Yeah, sure. What's up?

38:46.870 --> 38:48.919
The radio show, what
they said about you?

38:49.105 --> 38:50.653
That must be very difficult.

38:50.891 --> 38:53.242
Oh, Koji, really, it's no big deal.

38:53.820 --> 38:55.437
To be talked about in public,

38:55.563 --> 38:58.617
to have them suggest
what they suggested,

38:59.146 --> 39:01.777
I want you to know I
found it very distasteful.

39:02.069 --> 39:05.071
Thank you, Koji, but I'm an adult.

39:05.168 --> 39:06.360
I can handle it.

39:07.704 --> 39:08.774
But, yeah.

39:09.377 --> 39:14.014
You know, the light that follows Harley,
it can, you know,

39:14.048 --> 39:16.436
sometimes catch me off
guard with how bright it is.

39:16.751 --> 39:18.358
Now, I know you had nothing to do

39:18.383 --> 39:20.103
with what happened to Harley's marriage.

39:20.306 --> 39:22.908
That was purely Harley's foolishness.

39:23.028 --> 39:25.275
Yeah, and I sure as hell
wasn't sitting around here,

39:25.300 --> 39:26.735
waiting for Harley to come home.

39:28.773 --> 39:29.883
Sure.

39:30.603 --> 39:33.636
Koji, I have had my
share of relationships.

39:33.683 --> 39:35.128
They just haven't worked out.

39:35.823 --> 39:38.127
You know,
maybe I haven't found the right guy yet.

39:38.283 --> 39:39.744
I'm not disagreeing with you.

39:42.831 --> 39:44.942
That's not the same as agreeing.

39:45.926 --> 39:47.301
Oh, I lost it.

39:47.326 --> 39:48.473
You don't have it.

39:49.250 --> 39:51.476
I lost my bread. I lost it.

39:51.501 --> 39:52.686
You sucker!

39:52.720 --> 39:55.875
All right, I'm taking the
last piece of fondue, guys.

39:56.006 --> 39:57.047
Be my guest.

39:57.171 --> 40:00.141
I wasn't asking you. I was telling you.

40:00.295 --> 40:01.662
Wow. Hey, you know what?

40:01.687 --> 40:04.455
Maybe go gentle on me.
I had a gun pointed at me today.

40:04.605 --> 40:07.407
Oh, Dave. I'm so sorry about that.

40:07.802 --> 40:11.894
You know... maybe my dream was a warning

40:12.473 --> 40:15.168
that if I keep pushing my luck,

40:16.299 --> 40:18.000
there's only one place
left for it to go.

40:19.035 --> 40:20.049
So, what?

40:20.074 --> 40:23.182
We should just break up the
band because of your dream?

40:23.325 --> 40:26.293
Well, you did almost get killed, again.

40:27.156 --> 40:29.968
I dragged Sam into this whole
mess with the whole radio thing.

40:29.993 --> 40:31.563
No, I told you, that's just noise.

40:32.227 --> 40:34.383
I mean, that really has
nothing to do with you and me.

40:34.408 --> 40:35.430
But still.

40:36.227 --> 40:38.300
I think maybe my dream is telling me

40:38.325 --> 40:40.309
to stop taking advantage of my friends.

40:40.835 --> 40:43.937
You know when they say you're
worried, you're going crazy,

40:43.971 --> 40:44.992
you're not?

40:45.242 --> 40:46.976
Well, I'm not worried that I'm crazy.

40:47.359 --> 40:48.630
What does that tell you?

40:49.062 --> 40:51.738
No, no. What I-I mean to say is

40:52.213 --> 40:54.283
the same goes for selfish, Harley.

40:54.767 --> 40:56.705
When you're worried about
it as much as you are,

40:56.730 --> 40:59.017
I'd say it probably means you're not.

40:59.620 --> 41:01.798
And also, there's no way
I'm missing out on this.

41:02.189 --> 41:03.236
Me neither.

41:03.578 --> 41:06.013
But maybe next time you're with Harley,
you'll wear a vest.

41:07.256 --> 41:09.475
Or you could just give me my gun back.

41:10.197 --> 41:11.217
Or a vest.

41:12.101 --> 41:14.235
Okay, I'm gonna get this. Watch this.

41:14.668 --> 41:18.244
So close. Oh!

41:18.838 --> 41:19.846
Mm.

41:20.534 --> 41:21.851
Really not that exciting.

41:21.876 --> 41:22.893
It's really not.

41:24.291 --> 41:25.299
Jackpot!

41:25.324 --> 41:26.925
I'm so impressed, that's great.
