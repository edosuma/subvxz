<i>Theorizing that one could time travel
within his own lifetime,</i>

00:05.739 --> 00:08.674
<i>Dr. Sam Beckett stepped
into the Quantum Leap accelerator...</i>

00:08.742 --> 00:10.733
<i>and vanished.</i>

00:15.315 --> 00:17.943
<i>He awoke to find himself
trapped in the past,</i>

00:18.018 --> 00:21.545
<i>facing mirror images
that were not his own...</i>

00:21.621 --> 00:26.854
<i>and driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.</i>

00:26.926 --> 00:32.192
<i>His only guide on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time,</i>

00:32.265 --> 00:36.634
<i>who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear.</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:40.867
<i>And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,</i>

00:40.940 --> 00:43.875
<i>striving to put right
what once went wrong...</i>

00:43.943 --> 00:47.276
<i>and hoping each time
that his next leap...</i>

00:47.347 --> 00:49.338
<i>will be the leap home.</i>

00:51.284 --> 00:57.120
<i>Dr. Flanagan report to Emergency.
Dr. Flanagan-</i>

00:57.190 --> 01:00.626
Can you hear him?
He's out there! Who?

01:00.693 --> 01:03.856
Charlie! He's comin' over the
wire! He's gonna kill us all!

01:03.930 --> 01:07.058
<i>We gotta get outta here! He's
gonna cut our heads off! Baxter.!</i>

01:09.602 --> 01:14.096
I warned you about acting crazy on my
floor, didn't I? Trough "A"! Trough "A"!

01:14.174 --> 01:17.507
I guess I'm gonna have
to teach you a lesson.

01:17.577 --> 01:19.807
Now don't you fight me,
or I'll break your freakin' neck.

01:19.879 --> 01:22.780
- Hey, that isn't necessary, is it?
- Sam, don't get up.

01:22.849 --> 01:24.817
- Why not?
- Just don't get up.

01:24.884 --> 01:28.149
<i>I can't breathe. My arm.! Stop it.!
Charlie's comin'! Oh, you can't breathe, huh?</i>

01:28.221 --> 01:33.420
<i>- Charlie's comin'!
- You can't get up, because you don't have any legs.</i>

01:35.929 --> 01:37.863
Oh, boy.

02:51.838 --> 02:55.831
I'm
- Let go of me! I'm an American soldier! You're a pain in my butt.

02:55.909 --> 02:58.241
Can't do this to me.
Where am I, Al? Shut up!

02:58.311 --> 03:02.543
San Diego. Veterans Hospital.
Veteran? When?

03:02.615 --> 03:07.052
August 10th, 1968.
Vietnam.

03:07.120 --> 03:11.557
<i>You're a 26-year-old captain
in the marines named Ronald Miller.</i>

03:11.624 --> 03:15.390
You served two tours
before you lost both legs to a land mine.

03:15.461 --> 03:17.224
Why am I here?
Don't know.

03:17.297 --> 03:21.893
But when I saw Miller in the waiting room, I realized I had
to get down here quick, because it'd look pretty strange...

03:21.968 --> 03:25.870
if a guy without legs suddenly got up
and started walking around. I have legs.

03:25.939 --> 03:30.899
Not as far as anyone here is concerned. Look. You better
try and get me outta here as fast as you can, okay?

03:30.977 --> 03:36.313
Don't worry. I gotta go back, get a little more
information. In the meantime, just... stay put.

03:37.383 --> 03:40.477
The '60s.
It's a miracle any of us got out alive.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.986
<i>Would you like somejuice?</i>

03:45.058 --> 03:47.583
What?
Juice.

03:47.660 --> 03:53.292
I've got grape, and I've got grape. I'll, uh
- I'll have some grape.

03:53.366 --> 03:55.664
Excellent choice.

03:55.735 --> 04:00.172
My name's Kiki Wilson. I'm
- I'm Ron Miller.

04:00.240 --> 04:04.108
Nice to meet you, Ron.
Can I ask you a question?

04:04.177 --> 04:06.702
Sure.
What is this place?

04:06.779 --> 04:08.770
This is check-in.
Check-in?

04:08.848 --> 04:12.909
Every new patient has to be seen
by Commander Hartig.

04:12.986 --> 04:15.454
He's the big cheese around here.

04:15.521 --> 04:19.786
But if you ask me, he's more a rat.

04:21.160 --> 04:25.426
When do you think I might get in?
Miller, Captain Ronald!

04:25.498 --> 04:28.558
Hmm. Great karma.

04:28.635 --> 04:33.072
<i>Tell me, Ron, how do you feel
about losing your legs?</i>

04:34.140 --> 04:37.303
Don't you wanna take my temperature
or somethin' first?

04:37.377 --> 04:41.279
<i>Would that make you feel better?</i>

04:42.348 --> 04:45.215
Okay. How do I feel?

04:45.285 --> 04:47.719
How would you feel?

04:47.787 --> 04:50.654
I'm not the enemy, Captain.

04:51.724 --> 04:56.184
Says here you were at Khe Sanh.
I hear that was pretty rough.

04:56.262 --> 04:58.753
Yeah, I guess so.
You're a lucky man, Ron.

04:58.831 --> 05:01.561
Lucky?
Statistically speaking.

05:01.634 --> 05:05.468
Do you know what the combat survival rate
was in World War II? Seventy-one percent.

05:05.538 --> 05:10.908
In Korea, 74. You want to know what
it is now? Eight-five percent, Ron.

05:10.977 --> 05:15.209
American technology-
That's the key to victory.

05:16.783 --> 05:19.616
Okay, so what happens now?

05:20.687 --> 05:23.850
Well, you did most of
the physical healing in Tokyo.

05:23.923 --> 05:27.723
Our job here is to make you functional
again. Functional? What does that mean?

05:27.794 --> 05:33.562
You've been through a difficult ordeal, but there is no
reason you can't go on to lead a relatively productive life.

05:33.633 --> 05:38.661
"Relatively productive life. " Right. I
know. You're questioning things right now.

05:38.738 --> 05:42.970
But in the end, I think you'll find
the price was worth paying.

05:43.042 --> 05:47.206
I don't know. From where I
am, it looks a little high.

05:52.452 --> 05:54.386
<i>Yes, sir?</i>

05:54.454 --> 05:56.888
<i>Have a wheelchair brought in
for Captain Miller. Yes, sir.</i>

06:01.828 --> 06:07.767
I know you're lookin' for somebody to
blame. You're not gonna find him here.

06:07.834 --> 06:10.735
And I'm sure things'll look a lot better
once your wife gets here.

06:10.803 --> 06:13.397
- My wife?
- She's being flown in even as we speak.

06:13.473 --> 06:18.843
I'll make sure you're informed the
moment she arrives. Right. Uh, thanks.

06:20.646 --> 06:26.585
Hang in there, soldier. You'd be surprised
what a person can do... when they have to.

06:29.188 --> 06:33.249
<i>I wanted to help, so I became a volunteer.
It helps pass the time.</i>

06:33.326 --> 06:37.160
You don't strike me as a person
who just passes the time.

06:37.230 --> 06:41.098
Hmm, waiting is more like it.
Boyfriend?

06:41.167 --> 06:44.466
Little brother.
What's his name?

06:44.537 --> 06:46.562
Robert Allen.

06:46.639 --> 06:49.369
Bobby.

06:49.442 --> 06:52.036
How long has Bobby been gone?

06:53.112 --> 06:56.445
It'll be two years in December.
I'm sorry.

06:56.516 --> 07:01.180
Hmm. Not as sorry as he's gonna be
when I see him. What do the marines say?

07:01.254 --> 07:03.188
Oh, not much.

07:03.256 --> 07:08.023
Said he was part of a team that went out
on patrol and never came back. Oh, yeah?

07:10.229 --> 07:13.995
So how long has it been?
H- How long has what been?

07:14.066 --> 07:17.433
Since you've seen your wife.
Oh. Uh, well-

07:17.503 --> 07:20.768
I checked your chart. I hope you
don't mind. No, no. That's fine. I, uh-

07:20.840 --> 07:24.003
I just kinda lost track of time
a little bit, you know?

07:24.076 --> 07:27.045
Bet she's glad to have you back.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.911
Yeah, well, I don't know. L-

07:29.982 --> 07:33.440
I'm not sure I'm exactly what...
she was expecting.

07:33.519 --> 07:36.920
<i>X- ray technician on call,
please call the Emergency Room.</i>

07:36.989 --> 07:39.583
<i>X- ray technician on call-
Give me your hand.</i>

07:39.659 --> 07:42.150
Come on. I won't hurt you.

07:44.197 --> 07:48.463
Wait a second. You read palms? A
hundred-year-old Gypsy king taught me.

07:48.534 --> 07:51.435
Maybe he was closer to 80.

07:51.504 --> 07:54.803
But he was definitely a king.
How could you tell?

07:54.874 --> 07:59.243
'Cause he had a crown.
Of course he did.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.507
This is incredible.
What?

08:02.815 --> 08:07.684
I've never seen a life line this long.
You've got enough here for two people.

08:07.753 --> 08:09.687
Maybe more.

08:09.755 --> 08:13.156
This isn't an accident
that you're here.

08:13.226 --> 08:16.252
You're on a mission.
Someone needs you.

08:16.329 --> 08:20.493
Who?
Well, I can't really tell,

08:20.566 --> 08:23.433
but they're close.

08:24.504 --> 08:29.441
You've seen a lot of pain,
but you're not bitter.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.842
You're a searcher,
a seeker of truth.

08:32.912 --> 08:36.575
You see all that in my palm?

08:36.649 --> 08:39.311
Not all of it.

08:48.427 --> 08:50.987
All right! Here she is.
Whoo!

08:51.063 --> 08:54.055
Do your mothers know where
you are? You stole my heart.

08:54.133 --> 08:57.261
How do you put up with this?
They're harmless.

08:57.336 --> 09:01.363
How many men are in this place?

09:01.440 --> 09:06.377
<i>Too many. Well, here we are: Home sweet
home. How many times do I gotta say it?</i>

09:06.445 --> 09:08.470
<i>I told you, I don't want you
comin'around here.!</i>

09:08.548 --> 09:12.245
I just though we could talk about
it, Billy. I got nothin' left to say.

09:14.654 --> 09:19.318
<i>What is it, Billy? Hmm?
Is it this?</i>

09:19.392 --> 09:22.225
I told you, I don't care about this.
I care about you.

09:22.295 --> 09:26.994
<i>I love you, Billy. But I can't go
on watching you destroy yourself.</i>

09:27.066 --> 09:29.000
I won't-
Then don't!

09:35.141 --> 09:37.609
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

09:45.851 --> 09:47.910
If I leave,
I'm not coming back.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.695
<i>Carol.
It's over.</i>

10:03.769 --> 10:05.703
Are you okay?
Yeah, go ahead.

10:08.874 --> 10:14.335
It's amazing what love can make a
person do. What are you talkin' about?

10:14.413 --> 10:16.745
I'm talking about
sabotaging your own life.

10:16.816 --> 10:20.809
You don't think anybody in their right
mind would dump a woman like that, do you?

10:23.356 --> 10:25.483
Why's he doin' it, then?

10:26.559 --> 10:31.895
Well, it
- it's a lot easier to kill yourself if nobody cares.

10:45.211 --> 10:47.645
<i>Al, I don't understand.</i>

10:47.713 --> 10:49.840
Watch your back.
Why would he kill hims-

10:51.317 --> 10:53.751
Let's go down there.

10:59.792 --> 11:02.693
Al, what's goin' on?

11:02.762 --> 11:06.095
In two days
Sergeant William Johnson's body...

11:06.165 --> 11:10.568
is found at the bottom
of the hospital therapy pool.

11:10.636 --> 11:12.831
What?

11:12.905 --> 11:14.839
Why? I mean, he
- he's just a kid. Why?

11:14.907 --> 11:18.741
Did you ever wake up and find that
your arm has fallen asleep? Yeah.

11:18.811 --> 11:22.770
Well, imagine waking up and finding
that your entire body has fallen asleep,

11:22.848 --> 11:25.339
and it's never gonna wake up.

11:27.253 --> 11:31.189
How did it happen? Sniper.
Bullet severed his spinal cord.

11:31.257 --> 11:33.248
He lost most everything
from the neck down.

11:33.325 --> 11:37.887
Ziggy says there's an 84% chance that you're
here to keep him from finishing the job.

11:37.963 --> 11:40.955
Okay, well, when's he gonna try and
finish... the job? We don't know.

11:41.033 --> 11:44.628
The body is found on Monday, and since the
therapy pool is shut down over the weekend,

11:44.704 --> 11:47.798
he must get in there somehow
and do it over the next 48 hours.

11:47.873 --> 11:53.470
Wait. Wait a second. How does a guy
who can't move get into a pool by himself?

11:53.546 --> 11:56.777
Good question.
Yeah, well, ask Ziggy, all right?

11:56.849 --> 12:01.843
Ziggy doesn't know yet. And by the way,
my wife is- Miller's wife- is her way here.

12:01.921 --> 12:05.220
Julie Miller. Julie. Oh, good. I know
her first name. She probably knows mine.

12:05.291 --> 12:09.557
I mean, just think of all the things
we can talk about now.

12:09.628 --> 12:11.926
Hey, it could be worse.
How?

12:11.997 --> 12:15.831
You could spend your whole life
in that thing.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.370
You're right.

12:20.439 --> 12:23.067
Look, I better get back out there.

12:23.142 --> 12:27.442
Oh, Al, do me a favor, would ya? See what you can
find out about a marine named Robert Allen Wilson.

12:27.513 --> 12:30.414
Wilson. Okay, got it.
Who is he?

12:30.483 --> 12:33.714
Just... somebody's little brother.

12:38.424 --> 12:42.019
<i>The end of the '60s
was a confusing time for the country,</i>

12:42.094 --> 12:45.291
<i>and this leap
wasn't making things any clearer.</i>

12:45.364 --> 12:48.197
<i>I had a wife on the way
and a roommate to save,</i>

12:48.267 --> 12:52.101
<i>and I didn't know the first thing
about either one of them.</i>

12:52.171 --> 12:53.968
How's it goin'?

12:58.978 --> 13:03.472
My name's Ron.
Guess we're gonna be roommates, huh?

13:06.652 --> 13:11.180
Listen, I might as well tell ya that I've been, uh
- I've been known to snore the roof off,

13:11.257 --> 13:16.058
so if it starts gettin' to ya,
just, you know, throw a pillow or a-

13:19.231 --> 13:24.225
Maybe I oughta just unpack.
Yeah. I'm just gonna unpack.

13:28.207 --> 13:31.802
<i>16,412.
What?</i>

13:33.179 --> 13:35.170
Holes.

13:40.853 --> 13:43.583
Holes. You-
You counted 'em?

13:44.790 --> 13:46.985
I named 'em.

13:47.059 --> 13:49.323
Been here a long time, huh?

13:50.396 --> 13:52.921
All my life.

13:54.934 --> 13:57.402
Guess it must seem that way
after a while.

14:02.074 --> 14:06.773
You know, that girl that was just here-
Is that your girlfriend?

14:09.448 --> 14:12.212
- She's real pretty. You're a lucky guy.
- Do me a favor, will ya?

14:12.284 --> 14:14.252
- Yeah?
- Mind your own business.

14:15.621 --> 14:17.555
Right.

14:20.659 --> 14:23.093
<i>Ah, I see you two have met.</i>

14:25.598 --> 14:27.828
Yeah, we were just getting acquainted.

14:28.834 --> 14:34.397
I wouldn't get too close to this one. He
has a tendency to turn on you like a shark.

14:34.473 --> 14:37.772
- Don't you have some milk and cookies to pass out or somethin'?
- Be nice, Sergeant.

14:37.843 --> 14:39.936
I might put your bedpan
in the freezer again.

14:42.047 --> 14:44.413
Here, let me get that.
Thanks.

14:44.483 --> 14:50.149
Geez. Who packed this thing? I swear, I
don't know how you guys got along over there.

14:56.061 --> 14:58.928
Somebody must've packed these
by mistake, huh?

15:00.132 --> 15:02.498
<i>Captain Miller?</i>

15:03.636 --> 15:08.073
- Uh, yeah. I'm Miller.
- Sir, Captain Hartig sent me to get you.

15:08.140 --> 15:12.236
- For what? I just saw him.
- I'm not sure, but, uh, I think your wife is here.

15:13.846 --> 15:15.837
Oh.

15:17.917 --> 15:22.251
<i>- So, did you have a nice trip back?
- Yeah, it was fine.</i>

15:24.056 --> 15:29.995
L
- Listen, could we just stop over there for a moment? Yeah, if you'd like.

15:45.244 --> 15:47.974
You look good.

15:48.047 --> 15:53.542
Your hair's different, though,
isn't it? Yeah. I let it grow out.

15:53.619 --> 15:56.383
I thought a change might be nice.

15:57.756 --> 15:59.747
Change is good.

16:01.360 --> 16:05.194
I mean, it's good to- to- to
leave ourselves open to new things.

16:08.267 --> 16:13.068
It's funny. I feel like I did
the first time that we met.

16:13.138 --> 16:16.335
I was just feelin' the same way.
Remember?

16:16.408 --> 16:21.311
We were at the beach, and, uh, you were sitting
in the back of Cliff Parker's convertible.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.348
Oh, yeah. Cliff.

16:23.415 --> 16:26.384
Yeah, I heard Cliff got into
a helicopter crash. He died.

16:26.452 --> 16:28.852
I mean,
can you imagine that? L-

16:28.921 --> 16:33.381
He used to get sick on the Ferris wheel.
I mean, what was he doing in a helicopter?

16:38.263 --> 16:41.858
I'm not doin' this very
well, am I? No, i-it's okay.

16:44.770 --> 16:49.400
Oh, um, I spoke to your mother
before I left, and...

16:49.475 --> 16:53.912
she said that she would come and visit you as
soon as the doctor said that she was strong enough.

16:53.979 --> 16:57.574
Strong enough?
Yeah, because of the stroke.

16:57.649 --> 17:00.777
Right, the-
the stroke. Right.

17:00.853 --> 17:06.758
She said that she would call you
as soon as you got settled in, so-

17:07.826 --> 17:11.057
She's gonna be all right.
What about you?

17:13.932 --> 17:16.526
I don't know
what you want me to say.

17:16.602 --> 17:21.561
I'm here. Are you? Why
won't you look at me then?

17:25.676 --> 17:30.478
I have to- I- I have to go back to the hotel
and check in. I'm- I'm sorry. No. Julie.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.915
I just can't do this right now.
No, Julie.

17:32.985 --> 17:35.715
Julie. Julie!

17:40.159 --> 17:43.356
They told us the war was over
when we left the jungle.

17:45.364 --> 17:47.889
She couldn't even look at me, Al.
Give her time.

17:47.966 --> 17:51.834
You know, it's not like you
came home with a bad haircut.

17:53.372 --> 17:58.241
I'm not sure she's gonna come back, Al. Then you better go
after her and get her, 'cause I've been doin' some checking.

17:58.310 --> 18:01.279
It turns out that Miller went on
and had three sons,

18:01.346 --> 18:04.577
and the oldest one
followed in the old man's footsteps.

18:04.650 --> 18:06.618
Eh-
Sorry.

18:06.685 --> 18:10.348
You mean he joined the marines?
Uh, right out of high school.

18:10.422 --> 18:14.290
And he barely finished basic training when
they sent him to fight over in the Gulf War.

18:14.359 --> 18:19.262
Now, the thing is, while he was there,
he saved the lives of his entire tank crew.

18:19.331 --> 18:23.199
Well, then I have to patch things up between
me and Julie, or- or else- That's right-

18:23.268 --> 18:26.101
no son, and all the guys
in the Gulf die.

18:26.171 --> 18:31.473
So you gotta make this marriage work.
Okay. Okay, uh, what about Billy?

18:31.543 --> 18:36.981
Well, Ziggy hasn't had any luck in
determining the time of death, so- so, uh-

18:37.049 --> 18:41.008
Well, just-just keep him away
from the swimming pool.

18:47.659 --> 18:49.718
<i>Good.</i>

18:49.795 --> 18:52.127
<i>Destiny's a funny thing.</i>

18:52.197 --> 18:55.030
<i>It seems like the harder you try to stop it,</i>

18:55.100 --> 18:58.536
<i>the more determined it is to be fulfilled.</i>

18:58.604 --> 19:01.698
<i>I suddenly found myself
right where I didn't want to be.</i>

19:01.773 --> 19:06.676
<i>And from the looks of things, I wasn't alone.
Now, come on. You know the rules.</i>

19:09.047 --> 19:14.644
Why you doin' this, man? I can't move!
What the hell good is this supposed to do?

19:14.720 --> 19:18.019
<i>Don't worry about it, Sarge.
We'll get you a rubber ducky to play with.</i>

19:18.090 --> 19:20.388
<i>Look. I'm not gonna let you go, okay?</i>

19:25.564 --> 19:27.555
Good. Come on.
You boys enjoy your swim.

19:29.334 --> 19:33.464
<i>Just leave me alone.
Leave me alone, man.</i>

19:38.210 --> 19:42.670
Hey, this is a private beach.

19:44.583 --> 19:46.710
You know,

19:46.785 --> 19:51.051
once you get to know me,
you might find out I'm not such a bad guy.

19:51.123 --> 19:54.820
I don't wanna know you.
That's right. It could get a little risky.

19:54.893 --> 19:58.693
If you get to know me, then you start to
like me, then you gotta find a way to...

19:58.764 --> 20:01.392
run me off like you did Carol.

20:01.466 --> 20:03.559
Why the hell are you
so interested in my life?

20:03.635 --> 20:06.263
Well, I think the real question is:
Why aren't you?

20:08.674 --> 20:13.043
You gonna tell me about her?
You're not goin' anywhere.

20:19.484 --> 20:21.850
We met at school.

20:21.920 --> 20:25.947
She used to come down to the track
to watch me work out.

20:26.024 --> 20:29.619
High school sweethearts.
That's nice.

20:29.695 --> 20:35.327
Before I left for the 'Nam,
we went up into the mountains...

20:35.400 --> 20:38.836
and rented this-
this little cabin up there.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.873
The only way to get there was on foot.

20:43.008 --> 20:48.776
It was great. It had this-
this big stone fireplace.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.407
We slept on the floor.

20:55.687 --> 20:57.621
Made love there all night.

21:01.893 --> 21:04.987
We were gonna get married
after I finished my tour, but...

21:05.063 --> 21:09.557
I don't think they've found any
wheelchairs that can climb over rocks.

21:13.739 --> 21:16.299
There are other fireplaces.

21:17.376 --> 21:19.867
I'm sure she'd understand that.
That's just the point.

21:19.945 --> 21:23.244
Why should she have to understand?

21:23.315 --> 21:26.148
I was the one that died over there, not her.

21:29.054 --> 21:32.854
You know, there's only one problem
with your story:

21:34.293 --> 21:38.889
- You're not dead.
- Jimmy! He's drowning, man! Get him out!

21:43.502 --> 21:46.665
<i>Uh-oh.
Man, he went down like a rock.</i>

21:49.541 --> 21:51.702
<i>You okay?
All right, man. Just breathe.</i>

21:51.777 --> 21:54.610
<i>Just breathe.
It's all right. It's all right.</i>

21:55.681 --> 21:59.845
<i>Yeah, that's it. Just breathe.
I told you to stay away from the pool.</i>

21:59.918 --> 22:05.720
Al, I'm a patient here, okay? I'm not a
doctor. I can't just do whatever I want to do.

22:05.791 --> 22:09.352
Where's Billy?
Billy is in the brace shop, okay?

22:09.428 --> 22:11.828
He'll be back anytime.
Oh. Oh.

22:11.897 --> 22:16.266
Don't worry.
What's wrong with you?

22:17.336 --> 22:20.203
I've been trying to decide
if I should roll the cuffs up or not.

22:20.272 --> 22:23.503
What do you think? W- Well, what-
what difference does it make?

22:23.575 --> 22:29.241
Well
- Nobody sees you except me. Everybody else sees the real Miller.

22:29.314 --> 22:33.307
What, you goin' out somewhere
or somethin'? Well, yes and no.

22:33.385 --> 22:36.183
Yes and no? Well, I'm supposed
to have a date with Julie.

22:36.254 --> 22:39.018
Yeah? Right? But I
- I gotta stay here and watch Billy.

22:39.091 --> 22:42.527
No. Go out with Julie. You said I
have to stay with Billy. I can't leave.

22:42.594 --> 22:44.994
It's important for you to be
with Julie. I know, but how-

22:45.063 --> 22:47.258
I'll stay with Billy.
I'll keep an eye on him.

22:47.332 --> 22:51.234
If anything happens, I'll come and get
you, okay? It's important that you seeJulie.

22:51.303 --> 22:54.101
Settled? Settled.
It's settled.

22:54.172 --> 22:57.073
Listen, did you come up with any
information on, uh, Bobby Wilson?

22:57.142 --> 23:00.441
Who's
- Oh, the Special Forces guy. Yeah. Special Forces?

23:00.512 --> 23:04.778
Well, he was part of a special unit
that was attached to the C.I. A...

23:04.850 --> 23:08.047
for political assassination,
propaganda, covert stuff like that.

23:08.120 --> 23:11.749
That's how come we can't find him. What
do you mean? You got all this information.

23:11.823 --> 23:16.021
How can you not find him? Well, because there hasn't
been a trace of him since the day he disappeared.

23:16.094 --> 23:19.928
Ziggy's tryin' to find something more
current, but that's gonna take time.

23:19.998 --> 23:23.024
Speakin' of time, I better get
back to Billy. Good luck. Yeah.

23:31.309 --> 23:34.870
Relax.
You're tight.

23:34.946 --> 23:37.039
I am?

23:37.115 --> 23:39.208
Here, let's do this right.

23:39.284 --> 23:42.845
Well, um, uh-

23:42.921 --> 23:46.755
Oh, see, I- I don't know that that's
such a good idea, because, you know-

23:46.825 --> 23:50.818
Relax.
It's supposed to be therapeutic.

23:51.897 --> 23:54.730
Are you sure?

23:54.800 --> 23:58.531
Therapy is supposed to make you
feel better, right?

23:58.603 --> 24:01.071
Yeah.

24:01.139 --> 24:03.130
Do you feel better?

24:05.277 --> 24:07.472
Yeah.

24:07.546 --> 24:10.515
I hope I'm not interrupting.

24:10.582 --> 24:12.516
Julie.

24:21.193 --> 24:25.493
Hi. I, uh-
I didn't hear you come in.

24:25.564 --> 24:29.364
- I'm not surprised.
- Yeah. Yeah, um, look.

24:29.434 --> 24:33.495
Uh, Kiki- I mean, Kiki-
Miss Wilson was-

24:33.572 --> 24:36.302
was just giving me a-
Hand!

24:36.374 --> 24:40.174
A hand. Yeah. His shoulders were sore, so I was just
- just tryin' to make him relax.

24:40.245 --> 24:43.908
Yeah. You look
- You look really nice.

24:43.982 --> 24:46.678
- Is that a new dress?
- No.

24:46.751 --> 24:51.245
No. Well, you're kinda
early. That's the only thing.

24:51.323 --> 24:55.191
Well, I was dressed, so I thought I'd come
over. I guess I should have called first.

24:55.260 --> 24:58.593
No. No, no, it's- it's
really- It's- It's fine.

24:58.663 --> 25:02.724
What am I thinking? Um, Kiki,
this is Julie Miller, my wife.

25:02.801 --> 25:05.167
Julie, this is
Kiki Wilson. Hi. Hi.

25:05.237 --> 25:07.933
Kiki is my- my, uh-

25:08.006 --> 25:09.997
Friend.
Friend.

25:10.075 --> 25:12.066
She's my friend.

25:16.615 --> 25:19.106
Well, I guess I'd
better be going. Okay.

25:19.184 --> 25:21.652
Um,

25:21.720 --> 25:25.918
was... very nice meeting you, uh
- Same here.

25:27.926 --> 25:30.793
- Bye.
- Bye.

25:40.805 --> 25:43.330
<i>Right on.</i>

25:44.342 --> 25:46.333
<i>Sing it, sister.</i>

25:59.024 --> 26:01.015
Yeah.

26:15.907 --> 26:19.866
Well, it's not exactly
the, uh, Officers' Club, huh?

26:19.945 --> 26:22.641
Yeah, maybe we should go
somewhere else.

26:22.714 --> 26:24.978
<i>No, this is all right.
We're, uh-</i>

26:25.050 --> 26:27.985
<i>We're all Americans anyway.</i>

26:31.022 --> 26:33.013
Great.

26:35.827 --> 26:38.159
Thank you.
You're welcome.

26:39.998 --> 26:41.989
She's cute.

26:43.335 --> 26:45.303
Yeah.

26:45.370 --> 26:49.204
Not the waitress.
Miss Wilson. Oh, yeah.

26:49.274 --> 26:53.711
Well, I-I- I don't know. I never really
thought about it much. I guess so.

26:54.779 --> 26:57.976
She's not what I expected
a nurse to look like.

26:58.049 --> 27:02.418
Hmm, she's not a nurse. I mean, she's a
- she's a volunteer.

27:03.488 --> 27:07.049
A volunteer? Yeah.
Her brother is M.I.A.

27:07.125 --> 27:13.064
She's all alone, so I think workin' there helps
her kind of, uh, you know, deal with things.

27:14.132 --> 27:16.896
I see.
Yeah.

27:16.968 --> 27:21.530
Look.
I want to apologize for today, okay?

27:21.606 --> 27:24.074
I'm- I shouldn't have
pressed you so hard.

27:24.142 --> 27:27.134
It's just that things have been moving
so fast for me, and I forget that...

27:27.212 --> 27:30.909
they have to be affecting you,
too, so... I'm sorry.

27:30.982 --> 27:35.681
I could have handled things better myself. No, look. It
- It has been a long time, right?

27:35.754 --> 27:40.282
I mean, who's to say that we should just,
you know, pick right up where we left off?

27:40.358 --> 27:43.350
In many ways,
this is like a new beginning for us.

27:45.030 --> 27:46.964
Ronny.
Yeah?

27:47.032 --> 27:50.763
- I've been going over and over things, and I'm
just not sure that right now- - One more round-

27:50.835 --> 27:54.168
- Ah!
- Oh, man, I am so sorry.

27:54.239 --> 27:57.367
- No harm done.
- Well, hey, at least let me get you another...

27:58.677 --> 28:00.702
beer.

28:00.779 --> 28:02.770
It's all right.

28:06.484 --> 28:08.418
Peace.

28:16.361 --> 28:20.991
This isn't exactly how I was
hopin' things would go tonight. Uh-

28:22.067 --> 28:24.934
What were you hoping for?

28:25.003 --> 28:30.373
I don't know. I mean, I guess I was hoping that
I could show you that everything was the same.

28:31.443 --> 28:36.938
I mean, it's not, but, you know-
that we could be happy.

28:37.015 --> 28:40.075
We could still be a family,
y- you know?

28:40.151 --> 28:42.551
Family?
Yeah. L-

28:42.620 --> 28:47.717
I though that eventually we'd
have children, right? I mean,

28:47.792 --> 28:50.056
this isn't hereditary, you know.

28:51.896 --> 28:55.423
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
said that. It's just that I- I-

28:55.500 --> 29:00.494
I didn't expect you to react this way.
You do want children, don't you?

29:03.341 --> 29:07.778
Um, would you excuse me
for just one second?

29:26.397 --> 29:29.696
It's all right to be angry, you know?

29:30.769 --> 29:34.637
Things happened to all of us
over there that...

29:35.707 --> 29:38.175
are hard to live with.

29:38.243 --> 29:44.182
But we didn't start this filthy war. We just
fought it. That's what soldiers are for: They fight.

29:45.517 --> 29:50.113
And I bet you think nobody cares,
but that's not true,

29:50.188 --> 29:52.213
because I care, and Sam cares,

29:52.290 --> 29:58.229
and whatever it is that's jumping us
around in time cares.

30:04.202 --> 30:08.832
They're gonna build a wall
in Washington...

30:10.208 --> 30:13.336
and they're carve
all these names in it...

30:13.411 --> 30:17.507
of all the victims of this lousy war.

30:17.582 --> 30:20.779
Don't add another one to it, huh?

30:21.853 --> 30:24.947
There's so many.
There's too many.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.355
<i>Can I come in?</i>

30:32.397 --> 30:34.331
Not much I can do to stop you.

30:34.399 --> 30:37.926
I was on my way home, and I thought
you might need some cheering up.

30:38.002 --> 30:40.266
You think you can do that?

30:40.338 --> 30:44.672
- No, but I have something outside that might.
- What's that?

30:44.742 --> 30:48.007
<i>It's a surprise.
Close your eyes.</i>

30:49.013 --> 30:51.311
Close enough.

30:52.317 --> 30:55.718
<i>Ready or not, here we come.</i>

30:55.787 --> 30:58.347
Oh, no.

30:58.423 --> 31:02.291
Well, what do you think?

31:02.360 --> 31:05.887
I think I'm gonna be sick.

31:05.964 --> 31:10.401
- For me?
- I guess they figured you've been trapped in that bed long enough.

31:10.468 --> 31:12.402
How about a test ride?

31:12.470 --> 31:16.338
<i>Yeah.</i>

31:16.407 --> 31:18.807
Yeah, I'd like that.

31:19.878 --> 31:25.111
<i>- Sam! You gotta get back to the hospital.
He's heading for the pool.</i>

31:25.183 --> 31:30.120
Billy's heading
- How? Yes. They gave him an electric wheelchair. Can you believe that?

31:30.188 --> 31:34.056
<i>Look. You go back, keep an eye on
Billy. I'll be there as quick as I can.</i>

31:34.125 --> 31:36.719
But make it quick.
Yeah.

31:36.794 --> 31:39.558
<i>Good. I'm-
I'm glad you're back. Listen.</i>

31:39.631 --> 31:43.897
Something came up, and, uh, I have to go
back to the hospital. Ron, we need to talk.

31:43.968 --> 31:47.199
I know, and we will, but I
gotta go right now. No. Ron-

31:47.272 --> 31:49.570
Look, I'll call you as
soon as I can, okay? Ron.

31:52.243 --> 31:54.939
I want a divorce.

31:55.013 --> 31:58.278
What?

31:58.349 --> 32:01.045
I know how this must look,

32:02.720 --> 32:04.950
but I can't pretend anymore.

32:06.791 --> 32:09.851
You-You want a divorce?
Yeah.

32:09.928 --> 32:14.422
What about us-
I mean, our future?

32:16.100 --> 32:20.298
We talked about havin' a family, we-we-
No, you were talking about having a family.

32:25.243 --> 32:27.473
I met someone.

32:27.545 --> 32:31.481
I didn't mean for it to happen,
and I didn't plan on it. It just did.

32:31.549 --> 32:35.178
He works at the bank.

32:36.654 --> 32:40.488
It started out innocently,
I swear to you.

32:40.558 --> 32:42.856
We went to dinner,
and then a movie-

32:42.927 --> 32:47.227
And then... it changed.

32:52.136 --> 32:55.162
I was so afraid.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.333
I saw the fighting on the television,

32:58.409 --> 33:02.470
and I wasn't sure
if you were gonna come back or not.

33:04.582 --> 33:09.849
I wanted to tell you in Tokyo,
but I was afraid.

33:09.921 --> 33:14.984
You were hurt so badly.
I just didn't think you could handle it.

33:17.729 --> 33:21.290
Oh, God, it's this damn war!

33:25.136 --> 33:27.070
I'm sorry.

33:30.408 --> 33:32.342
<i>Julie.</i>

33:34.012 --> 33:36.503
L- I have to know.

33:39.017 --> 33:42.612
Would it have made a difference
if I hadn't-

33:47.592 --> 33:50.254
I don't know.

33:50.328 --> 33:53.320
<i>I don't know.</i>

34:02.940 --> 34:06.000
Yo! Yo! Whoo!

34:20.058 --> 34:24.188
It's about time. What took you so
long? Are you kiddin' me? Where's Billy?

34:24.262 --> 34:28.858
He's poolside. Gotta hurry. It looks like he's
about to take the plunge. I'll make it. I'll make it.

34:29.934 --> 34:32.596
Well, well.
Just the man I've been lookin' for.

34:42.713 --> 34:48.549
<i>- You're makin'a big mistake.
- No, you made the mistake, buddy. Nobody leaves my floor after dark.</i>

34:48.619 --> 34:52.612
You know, you war heroes come in here,
and you think you own the place.

34:52.690 --> 34:56.558
- Well, this is my jungle now.
- Come on, Sam. We don't have time for this stuff!

34:56.627 --> 35:00.996
Look, I don't have time to explain, but Billy is
in big trouble. Yeah? So are you. Now let's go.

35:01.065 --> 35:04.364
What are you doin'?
What's it look like I'm doin'?

35:04.435 --> 35:09.134
Maybe a few days in bed'll help you
remember who's in charge around here.

35:10.208 --> 35:14.008
Look, you don't have to believe me.
Just go to the pool and check for yourself.

35:14.078 --> 35:16.012
You want me to check the pool?
Yes!

35:16.080 --> 35:19.641
Okay, I'll check the pool...
Monday morning.

35:19.717 --> 35:22.151
<i>Sam, I think it's time that you...</i>

35:22.220 --> 35:25.815
rise to the occasion,
if you get my drift.

35:25.890 --> 35:29.018
Check the hall.

35:30.128 --> 35:34.758
Why? Is there trouble
out there too? Oh, boy.

35:35.766 --> 35:40.669
<i>They let every head case in the country fight this war,
and I get stuck in this hole on account offlat feet.</i>

35:40.738 --> 35:43.206
- There's no justice, man.
- Go for it.

35:46.344 --> 35:50.280
<i>You guys gotta learn
that you ain't in Vietnam no mo-</i>

35:57.054 --> 35:59.249
- You were saying?
- Oh, my God.

36:02.059 --> 36:04.687
- This is impossible.
- Say good night, Gracie.

36:06.297 --> 36:08.231
Ah, that felt good.

36:08.299 --> 36:10.597
Come on. We gotta get outta here.
Oh, yeah, right.

36:10.668 --> 36:13.102
<i>Sam, wait.!
You're forgetting something.</i>

36:24.749 --> 36:27.343
<i>Little late for a swim, isn't it?</i>

36:28.786 --> 36:31.778
Go away, Captain.
This doesn't involve you.

36:31.856 --> 36:36.225
Yeah, well, seein' as how
I'm here, I guess it does.

36:37.895 --> 36:40.090
I should've died in that stinkin'jungle.

36:42.633 --> 36:44.567
The war's over, Sergeant.

36:44.635 --> 36:48.935
Over?
Does this look like it's over to you?

36:53.511 --> 36:56.571
I was an all-state halfback
in high school.

36:57.648 --> 37:01.641
I scored 15 touchdowns my senior year.

37:03.387 --> 37:06.117
My body was perfect,

37:07.191 --> 37:09.386
yet, and now I can't even feel it.

37:09.460 --> 37:11.951
- Well, y-you still got your mind.
- Do I?

37:14.565 --> 37:17.534
Sam, I think you're losin' him.

37:17.602 --> 37:21.129
You know, you're not the only one
hurtin' around here.

37:22.206 --> 37:25.607
My wife just told me
that she wants a divorce.

37:25.676 --> 37:30.613
She said she met someone else
and that things aren't the same anymore.

37:32.250 --> 37:35.913
<i>She's right.
They're not. We're not.</i>

37:40.625 --> 37:43.355
Things won't ever be the same again.

37:43.427 --> 37:48.330
Nobody could go through what we did
and ever be the same.

37:48.399 --> 37:51.095
But that doesn't mean
that we don't count.

37:51.168 --> 37:53.796
You don't get it, do you?

37:53.871 --> 37:58.638
This war don't mean nothin'.
It never did.

37:58.709 --> 38:04.147
They gave us the-
the prettiest guns and the biggest bombs,

38:04.215 --> 38:07.150
but they didn't give us a chance.

38:08.219 --> 38:10.710
I lost everything,

38:10.788 --> 38:14.554
and in a few years
nobody'll even remember Vietnam.

38:14.625 --> 38:16.616
Then we have to remind them.

38:17.695 --> 38:22.189
We won't let them forget, because every
time they see us, they'll have to remember.

38:25.636 --> 38:31.404
You know, at night, I close my eyes and-
and I'm back there.

38:31.475 --> 38:35.343
I see it all. It
- It's like a song that plays over and over again,

38:35.413 --> 38:38.678
and you can't get it out of your head.

38:39.750 --> 38:43.242
Sometimes it gets so loud,

38:44.322 --> 38:46.916
I think my brain is gonna explode.

38:51.762 --> 38:54.253
I just want it to be quiet.

38:56.567 --> 38:58.501
How can I make it quiet?

39:02.106 --> 39:04.574
Maybe you're right.

39:05.843 --> 39:08.437
- Maybe your way is the best way of doin' things.
- What?

39:08.512 --> 39:11.276
- And I'm gonna help you.
- Sam, this isn't funny.

39:13.250 --> 39:15.650
You got nothin' to live for, right?

39:17.221 --> 39:19.883
You got rid of Carol.

39:19.957 --> 39:25.088
You've gone out of your way to make sure that
nobody else around here gives a damn about you.

39:26.664 --> 39:30.065
What's one more body bag?
Don't listen to him, kid.

39:30.134 --> 39:34.764
Sam, I don't know what the hell you're tryin' to
do, but I want you to stop it right now, you hear me?

39:34.839 --> 39:36.773
- Go on. Push it.
- Sam!

39:36.841 --> 39:39.810
You think I won't?

39:41.011 --> 39:42.945
It's easy to die, Billy.

39:51.288 --> 39:54.121
<i>No!</i>

39:55.493 --> 40:01.125
<i>I can't believe I'm watching this.! Have you
completely lost your mind? He's gonna drown.!</i>

40:01.198 --> 40:04.395
<i>If I had stopped him, who's to say
he wouldn't have tried again tomorrow?</i>

40:04.468 --> 40:08.632
Tomorrow? If you don't save him, there isn't
gonna be any tomorrow for either one of you!

40:08.706 --> 40:12.301
Al, don't you get it?
The only person who can save Billy is Billy.

40:12.376 --> 40:14.401
<i>Sam, what the hell
are you talkin'about?</i>

40:14.478 --> 40:19.814
I'm talkin' about death. He's never gonna
be able to face life until he faces death.

40:30.694 --> 40:32.628
- Are we close?
- I hope so.

40:43.808 --> 40:46.777
Help me! Help me!

40:47.845 --> 40:51.042
You got a second chance, Billy.

40:51.115 --> 40:54.551
What's it gonna be? Huh?

41:04.462 --> 41:07.295
<i>It's a good thing you showed up when you did.
Thanks, Captain.</i>

41:07.364 --> 41:12.131
What the hell made you come down here
anyway? Oh, I don't know. I just, uh-

41:12.203 --> 41:17.072
<i>Well, I- I just had a feeling
that I should be here.</i>

41:18.142 --> 41:21.805
I still don't see how you were able
to pull him out with just your arms.

41:21.879 --> 41:25.076
Well, you know,

41:25.149 --> 41:28.243
you'd be surprised what
a person can do when they have to.

41:28.319 --> 41:30.651
<i>Get out of the way.!</i>

41:30.721 --> 41:33.849
Hey, look who's here: Florence
Nightingale. This should be good.

41:33.924 --> 41:36.757
- What's this all about, mister?
- Him.

41:38.062 --> 41:40.030
L- I saw him do it.

41:40.097 --> 41:42.895
- You saw him do what?
- He walked.

41:44.435 --> 41:47.029
- What did you say?
- Do you wanna get the net, or should I?

41:47.104 --> 41:51.438
- He got up, and he- he floated
across the room. - Sure, he did.

41:51.509 --> 41:56.572
- I don't know what your problem is, and I don't have time to figure it out.
- I'm not crazy. I saw him do it!

41:56.647 --> 41:58.581
He got up and he hit me!

42:01.519 --> 42:05.421
Get this garbage outta here. You gotta
believe me! I saw him! He stood up!

42:05.489 --> 42:08.788
He was floating in midair!
He was smiling!

42:08.859 --> 42:11.726
I swear! You gotta believe me!

42:11.795 --> 42:14.525
Some people
just can't handle the stress.

42:14.598 --> 42:17.465
Can I give you a hand back
to your room? Uh, no, thanks.

42:17.535 --> 42:20.299
I'm gonna stay down here
for a while. All right.

42:21.639 --> 42:26.702
<i>Oh, I tried to contact your wife to let her know
what happened, but the hotel said she'd checked out.</i>

42:28.612 --> 42:30.876
I'm sorry.

42:32.716 --> 42:35.514
I blew it, Al.

42:35.586 --> 42:39.283
What do you mean, you blew it? You saved
Billy, didn't you? Yeah, at what price?

42:39.356 --> 42:43.019
You heard him. Julie's gone.
That means there's no son,

42:43.093 --> 42:46.460
and those men in the Gulf
are history.

42:46.530 --> 42:48.657
Well, that's true.

42:48.732 --> 42:51.030
Unless-
Unless what?

42:51.101 --> 42:53.069
Well, un-un-unless-
Unless what?

42:53.137 --> 42:56.698
You rewrote it, because according
to this, everything's the same:

42:56.774 --> 42:58.799
The kids, the Gulf, everything.

42:58.876 --> 43:01.276
<i>That's not possible.
Julie's gone, right? Ron.</i>

43:01.345 --> 43:03.973
Forget aboutJulie.

43:07.518 --> 43:11.181
I never bothered to check the mother's name.
I just assumed-

43:11.255 --> 43:15.453
- I got home, and they called. Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

43:17.127 --> 43:20.995
Billy?
I think he's gonna be okay.

43:21.065 --> 43:26.025
I feel responsible. I didn't think he would do
something like this. How could you have known?

43:26.103 --> 43:29.436
Well, at least one good thing
came out of it.

43:29.506 --> 43:32.100
Figured out what
your mission was.

43:32.176 --> 43:35.304
Well, I'm not sure
I knew what it was until just now.

43:42.286 --> 43:45.517
It was almost a perfect ending,
wasn't it?

43:45.589 --> 43:50.253
Perfect ending?
What are you talking about?

43:50.327 --> 43:54.195
Kiki?
Are you all right?

43:55.265 --> 44:00.703
When I got home tonight, I found
this envelope. It's from Washington,

44:00.771 --> 44:03.365
and I haven't really
been able to open it yet.

44:03.440 --> 44:07.536
<i>And I thought maybe-
Please.</i>

44:15.386 --> 44:17.877
<i>It's Bobby, isn't it?</i>

44:17.955 --> 44:21.982
I begged him to go to Canada.

44:22.059 --> 44:26.689
I packed his bags at least 10 times.
He just wouldn't listen.

44:26.764 --> 44:30.928
He had to go defend his country.

44:32.002 --> 44:34.300
I took care of him.

44:36.373 --> 44:38.864
I always knew what to do.

44:40.944 --> 44:43.606
What am I gonna do now?

44:45.683 --> 44:51.121
Well, you can cry,
and then you can make a cake.

44:54.458 --> 44:56.892
- His plane lands in 10 hours.
- Yes!

45:02.800 --> 45:06.099
He's coming home.
He's really coming home?

45:08.005 --> 45:10.701
He's really coming home!
My God.

45:13.043 --> 45:17.707
Yeah.
He's comin' home.

45:27.558 --> 45:32.495
<i>Man Announcing] And now the 8:00 news. Tom
Crenshaw brings us today's top story. A special-</i>

45:32.563 --> 45:35.088
<i>Mommy, look. It's him.!</i>

45:35.165 --> 45:39.795
Stiles has previously been
convicted on two felony counts.

45:40.871 --> 45:44.568
Stiles escaped custody
in a daring daylight shootout.

45:44.641 --> 45:48.202
Stiles, described by authorities
as "an illiterate drifter,"

45:48.278 --> 45:53.238
was recently arrested in connection with the
murders of at least eight women in three states.

45:53.317 --> 45:55.478
Stiles made his violent escape...

45:55.552 --> 45:59.886
<i>after killing two deputies
and seriously wounding another.</i>

45:59.957 --> 46:02.255
<i>Police warn that he may
still be in the area-</i>

46:02.326 --> 46:06.285
<i>Oh, boy. And should be considered
armed and extremely dangerous.</i>
