WEBVTT

00:06.439 --> 00:08.270
Good morning.

00:08.341 --> 00:09.568
You're in a good mood.

00:09.642 --> 00:11.610
lt's another beautiful
day in the Delta Quadrant.

00:11.711 --> 00:13.804
What'd you have
for breakfast?

00:16.015 --> 00:17.278
l'll see you tonight.

00:21.888 --> 00:23.412
Here you are, Lieutenant.

00:23.490 --> 00:24.548
Thank you.

00:29.496 --> 00:30.986
Nice job, Ensign.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.001
You keep the warp field
that stable,

00:36.102 --> 00:38.127
you might just get us home
a few years early.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.236
The Starfleet Manual

00:43.309 --> 00:45.209
allows for a variance of .3.

00:45.278 --> 00:47.007
That's only a guideline.

00:47.080 --> 00:48.638
You can do better.

00:52.285 --> 00:55.015
l don't remember giving you
permission to work here.

00:55.088 --> 00:57.522
l'm sorry, Lieutenant.

00:57.590 --> 00:59.956
l'm helping him study
warp mechanics.

01:00.026 --> 01:01.789
You should have notified me.

01:01.861 --> 01:03.453
lt's a busy day, and l...

01:03.530 --> 01:04.757
Lieutenant.

01:04.831 --> 01:06.526
l'm fine.

01:13.706 --> 01:16.197
l'm detecting another life sign.

01:16.309 --> 01:18.174
Where?

01:18.244 --> 01:19.677
lnside Lieutenant Torres.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.543
lt could be a parasite.

01:27.420 --> 01:28.751
Seven of Nine to the Doctor.

01:28.822 --> 01:29.948
Go ahead.

01:30.056 --> 01:31.717
l'll be accompanying
Lieutenant Torres

01:31.791 --> 01:32.951
to Sick Bay.

01:33.059 --> 01:33.957
What's wrong?

01:34.060 --> 01:36.620
l believe she's pregnant.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:34.747 --> 03:37.181
The fetus appears
to be about seven weeks old

03:37.250 --> 03:38.649
and doing quite well.

03:38.718 --> 03:39.844
So are you.

03:39.919 --> 03:42.615
Why did she faint?

03:42.689 --> 03:45.351
Klingon and human metabolisms
sometimes clash.

03:45.425 --> 03:46.449
Tell me about it.

03:46.526 --> 03:48.517
lt's not uncommon
for such pregnancies

03:48.595 --> 03:52.258
to cause biochemical
fluctuations in the mother.

03:52.332 --> 03:53.356
ls that serious?

03:53.433 --> 03:54.627
Not usually.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.965
You can expect
some behavioral volatility,

03:58.071 --> 04:00.403
increased nutritional needs.

04:00.473 --> 04:03.101
Creating new life is a big job.

04:03.176 --> 04:06.339
Hmm. ''Creating new life.''

04:06.412 --> 04:08.312
l can't believe it.

04:08.381 --> 04:10.440
l don't mean to be indelicate,

04:10.516 --> 04:13.314
but weren't you trying
to get pregnant?

04:13.386 --> 04:15.854
Well... of course.

04:15.922 --> 04:19.483
l mean... well, we knew
we wanted a family.

04:19.559 --> 04:21.459
But the odds against
human-Klingon conception

04:21.527 --> 04:22.459
are so high.

04:22.528 --> 04:23.460
Well, apparently

04:23.529 --> 04:24.689
you've beaten the odds.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.425
May l be the first
to congratulate you?

04:27.634 --> 04:29.602
When is the baby due?

04:29.702 --> 04:32.262
Normally, Klingon pregnancies
run 30 weeks,

04:32.372 --> 04:35.170
but with mixed species,
it could be sooner.

04:35.241 --> 04:37.266
ls it a girl or a boy?

04:37.377 --> 04:38.639
No. Don't tell.

04:38.711 --> 04:40.804
Uh, l want to be surprised.

04:40.880 --> 04:43.440
Ah. We've already
been surprised.

04:43.516 --> 04:47.043
l just don't see any reason
to have to label the baby.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.178
l don't want to know
the gender.

04:48.254 --> 04:49.653
l don't want to have
to pick a name yet.

04:49.722 --> 04:51.747
Okay, okay.

04:51.824 --> 04:53.416
Mommy knows best.

04:53.493 --> 04:55.859
''Mommy''?

04:58.531 --> 05:01.523
l wonder if the holodeck
has any child-rearing programs.

05:01.634 --> 05:04.068
There are some things
you just can't simulate.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.832
l will take whatever
help l can get.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.439
We should get our
quarters ready.

05:07.540 --> 05:09.872
Maybe l can replicate
one of those antique cribs.

05:09.942 --> 05:11.000
And put it where?

05:11.077 --> 05:13.170
We'll need to rearrange
the living area.

05:13.246 --> 05:15.407
We need to do
a lot more than that.

05:15.481 --> 05:17.244
You're happy
about this, right?

05:17.317 --> 05:20.150
Of course l'm happy.

05:20.219 --> 05:21.880
Just a little overwhelmed,
that's all.

05:21.954 --> 05:23.251
Me, too.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.656
Can we, uh, keep this
to ourselves for a while?

05:26.726 --> 05:27.988
Absolutely.

05:34.367 --> 05:36.631
l, uh... l need to get to work.

05:37.804 --> 05:40.864
See you later... Dad.

05:49.048 --> 05:52.074
Congratulations, Tom.

05:52.151 --> 05:54.381
Thanks. How did you find out?

05:54.454 --> 05:55.716
lcheb.

05:55.788 --> 05:58.951
Oh, he wasn't
supposed to tell?

05:59.092 --> 06:01.390
Well, we were hoping
to keep it private...

06:01.461 --> 06:03.827
for an hour or so.

06:03.963 --> 06:08.832
As they say on Talax,
Omara s'alas--

06:08.968 --> 06:11.436
''Good news has no clothes.''

06:12.739 --> 06:14.707
Thanks... l guess.

06:14.807 --> 06:17.037
Mm. Now, my good news
would be learning

06:17.110 --> 06:18.873
that l'll be the godfather.

06:18.945 --> 06:22.346
l do have experience
with Naomi Wildman, you know.

06:22.415 --> 06:25.077
l can't think of anyone
more qualified.

06:25.151 --> 06:29.485
Well, in that case, l've been
making up a list of names.

06:29.555 --> 06:30.522
Tell me...

06:32.592 --> 06:34.059
Have you checked
the warp core

06:34.127 --> 06:35.492
for radiation leaks today?

06:35.561 --> 06:37.461
No. Why?

06:37.530 --> 06:40.931
You have a certain...
glow about you.

06:42.969 --> 06:44.937
Okay, who told you?

06:45.004 --> 06:46.437
l just heard.

06:46.506 --> 06:48.371
Congratulations.

06:49.642 --> 06:50.609
Thanks.

06:50.676 --> 06:52.303
Seven said you were dizzy.
Are you all right?

06:52.378 --> 06:53.640
l'm fine.

06:53.713 --> 06:55.840
Nothing ever rattled her,
not even the Cardassians.

06:55.915 --> 06:56.939
This is scarier.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.277
Would you like some time off?

06:58.351 --> 06:59.943
To do what?

07:00.019 --> 07:00.917
Adjust.

07:00.987 --> 07:02.579
This is a big change.

07:02.655 --> 07:04.953
l'll work during the day,
sleep at night,

07:05.024 --> 07:06.924
and have the baby
when it's time.

07:06.993 --> 07:08.824
Well, if you need to
cut back on your duties,

07:08.961 --> 07:10.189
l'm sure Seven would be happy

07:10.263 --> 07:11.696
to fill in for you.

07:11.764 --> 07:13.755
l think l can handle it.

07:13.833 --> 07:15.357
Congratulations, buddy.

07:15.468 --> 07:17.527
Where did you hear the news?

07:17.637 --> 07:18.968
ln the datastream
from Earth?

07:19.038 --> 07:19.970
Actually, l think

07:20.039 --> 07:21.233
it was a transmission
from the Borg.

07:21.340 --> 07:23.808
lt's all over now.

07:23.876 --> 07:25.741
No more late nights
on the holodeck.

07:25.812 --> 07:27.404
No more racing
the Delta Flyer.

07:27.480 --> 07:30.142
Don't you think you're
exaggerating just a little?

07:30.216 --> 07:31.410
l've seen it happen.

07:31.484 --> 07:33.748
The new dad gets
tied down with family.

07:33.820 --> 07:35.082
Old friends drop away.

07:35.154 --> 07:37.782
lt's fatherhood, Harry,
not exile.

07:37.857 --> 07:39.017
lf you say so.

07:39.091 --> 07:41.616
Kidding aside, how's it feel?

07:41.694 --> 07:43.662
Well, it's...

07:43.729 --> 07:47.130
lt's not quite real yet.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.225
Maybe that's
what pregnancy's for.

07:49.335 --> 07:52.998
Time to let reality sink in...

07:53.105 --> 07:55.335
before your life
spins out of control.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.410
You need any help?

08:09.489 --> 08:13.050
Mr. Paris, this may
be the first time

08:13.125 --> 08:15.218
you've ever volunteered
to assist me.

08:15.294 --> 08:16.761
Really?

08:16.829 --> 08:18.820
Well, we ought to change that.

08:18.931 --> 08:20.990
l mean, we've known each other
a long time.

08:21.067 --> 08:22.534
We ought to work more closely.

08:22.635 --> 08:24.330
l'll keep that in mind.

08:24.437 --> 08:27.406
So l guess you've heard

08:27.507 --> 08:29.873
B'Elanna and l are going
to have a baby.

08:30.009 --> 08:32.034
l was unaware.

08:32.111 --> 08:35.205
Oh. Finally, someone
who doesn't know.

08:35.280 --> 08:38.477
Allow me to extend
my best wishes.

08:38.551 --> 08:40.212
Thanks.

08:40.285 --> 08:43.221
You know, a baby is, uh,...

08:43.289 --> 08:46.781
it's a big responsibility,

08:46.859 --> 08:48.690
but l'm ready for it.

08:48.761 --> 08:52.629
Not that, uh, you can ever be
completely ready.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.325
Can you?

08:54.400 --> 08:59.861
Lieutenant, are you asking me
for advice about fatherhood?

08:59.972 --> 09:02.634
Well, l don't know anyone else
who's been through it.

09:02.742 --> 09:06.041
l'm afraid my parenting skills
are somewhat dormant.

09:06.078 --> 09:09.275
lt's been many years
since my children were young.

09:09.348 --> 09:12.681
Well then, you've had a long
time to think back on it.

09:12.752 --> 09:13.980
Any helpful hints?

09:14.053 --> 09:18.046
Offspring can be
disturbingly illogical,

09:18.124 --> 09:21.116
yet profoundly fulfilling.

09:21.193 --> 09:24.822
You should anticipate paradox.

09:24.897 --> 09:28.162
Ah. l'll remember that.

09:28.267 --> 09:31.327
lf you'd like my counsel
on more specific issues...

09:31.437 --> 09:34.804
Something tells me
l'm going to be volunteering

09:34.874 --> 09:37.104
to work with you
on a regular basis.

09:47.186 --> 09:48.380
So?

09:48.454 --> 09:49.853
Looks nice.

09:49.922 --> 09:54.188
Well, l figured
quiet, romantic dinners

09:54.260 --> 09:56.626
may soon be
a thing of the past.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.322
Tough day?

10:00.399 --> 10:04.665
The Captain practically
relieved me of duty...

10:04.770 --> 10:06.431
as if l couldn't handle
being an engineer

10:06.539 --> 10:08.006
and being pregnant
at the same time.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.938
Well, if you
ever need a baby-sitter,

10:10.076 --> 10:12.544
''Godfather Neelix''
is ready to go.

10:12.645 --> 10:14.374
Chakotay wants to be godfather.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.438
Well, Neelix already has
a list of names.

10:16.515 --> 10:19.211
Now, l don't mind people
suggesting names.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.277
What annoys me is
all of the free advice

10:22.355 --> 10:24.448
about feeding, discipline.

10:24.523 --> 10:26.115
Folk wisdom is my favorite.

10:26.192 --> 10:28.319
According to Chell,
Bolians believe

10:28.394 --> 10:30.794
that if you give birth
near a warp core

10:30.863 --> 10:33.161
it'll improve
the baby's disposition.

10:33.232 --> 10:34.426
Why does everybody feel

10:34.500 --> 10:36.331
they're entitled
to give us advice?

10:36.435 --> 10:37.402
This is our child.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.869
Well, people
should know better

10:38.938 --> 10:40.929
than to interfere
with a Klingon mother.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.769
What's that supposed to mean?

10:42.842 --> 10:44.241
Nothing. lt was a joke.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.709
What does being Klingon

10:45.778 --> 10:46.836
have to do with it?

10:46.912 --> 10:47.936
Hey, take it easy.

10:48.014 --> 10:49.504
l don't want to take it easy.

10:49.582 --> 10:52.142
l want everybody to back off
and just let me...

10:57.923 --> 10:59.914
The Doctor said
l might experience

10:59.992 --> 11:01.550
some behavioral volatility.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.027
l guess this is it.

11:04.063 --> 11:07.089
Well, forget about the Doctor.

11:07.166 --> 11:12.069
Forget the Captain
and all the godfathers.

11:12.138 --> 11:13.105
Maybe you're right.

11:13.205 --> 11:14.297
l know l am.

11:14.407 --> 11:18.571
This isn't about
their expectations or hopes

11:18.644 --> 11:21.875
or... doubts.

11:21.947 --> 11:24.472
None of this belongs to them.

11:24.550 --> 11:27.075
lt belongs to us.

11:28.654 --> 11:30.212
All of it.

11:30.289 --> 11:31.916
Lucky us.

11:31.991 --> 11:34.926
Lieutenants Torres and Paris

11:34.994 --> 11:36.791
please report to Sick Bay.

11:39.732 --> 11:44.328
lt's a holographic extrapolation
of your child's spine,

11:44.437 --> 11:45.927
approximately ten months
after birth.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.369
lt's deviated.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.670
Yes. There's a pronounced
curvature to the left.

11:49.742 --> 11:50.970
Can it be corrected?

11:51.043 --> 11:53.443
l had surgery for it
when l was a baby.

11:53.512 --> 11:54.877
You never told me that.

11:54.947 --> 11:56.346
My mother had it, too.

11:56.415 --> 11:58.610
lt tends to run
in Klingon families,

11:58.684 --> 12:00.345
especially among females.

12:01.587 --> 12:04.420
Are you saying
that this baby is a girl?

12:04.490 --> 12:05.889
No, l didn't say that.

12:05.958 --> 12:07.482
But it is a girl, right?

12:07.560 --> 12:09.425
You cannot infer that.

12:09.495 --> 12:11.463
lt's okay. You might
as well just tell us.

12:12.932 --> 12:13.990
Yes.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.465
it's a girl...

12:15.568 --> 12:18.935
and aside from
the deviated spine,

12:19.004 --> 12:20.471
she's healthy.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.098
Will she need surgery?

12:23.209 --> 12:25.143
Fortunately,
we've advanced beyond that.

12:25.211 --> 12:27.645
Genetic modification
is the treatment of choice.

12:27.713 --> 12:31.274
lf you can project
an image of the spine,

12:31.350 --> 12:33.784
can you use the genetic data

12:33.853 --> 12:36.185
to show us the whole baby?

12:37.790 --> 12:39.348
l could.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.586
l-it would only be
an approximation.

12:41.660 --> 12:43.719
Let's take a look.

12:43.796 --> 12:44.728
l don't know.

12:44.797 --> 12:45.729
Oh, come on.

12:45.798 --> 12:47.231
Aren't you curious?

12:49.201 --> 12:50.327
Okay.

13:03.549 --> 13:04.982
Oh, she's beautiful.

13:05.050 --> 13:07.518
Forehead ridges?

13:07.586 --> 13:09.213
Yes.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.813
But she's only
one-quarter Klingon.

13:11.891 --> 13:14.416
Klingon traits remain dominant
for several generations,

13:14.493 --> 13:15.824
even with a single ancestor.

13:15.895 --> 13:19.058
Oh, she looks just
like her mother.

13:22.568 --> 13:24.559
You are so much
like your mother.

13:24.670 --> 13:27.503
She's perfect...

13:29.241 --> 13:31.106
isn't she?

13:43.189 --> 13:45.657
Oh, what a day.

13:45.724 --> 13:47.055
Mm-hmm.

13:47.126 --> 13:48.923
Six years in
the Delta Quadrant

13:48.994 --> 13:50.393
and nothing has ever
scared me as much

13:50.462 --> 13:52.555
as hearing our baby
had a problem.

13:52.631 --> 13:54.189
lt's not much of a problem.

13:54.266 --> 13:55.961
Well, we didn't know that
at first.

13:56.068 --> 13:57.797
Now we know.

13:58.971 --> 14:01.201
And we also know that the Doctor

14:01.273 --> 14:05.175
is going to fix everything
tomorrow morning.

14:06.278 --> 14:07.836
l'm sorry.

14:07.913 --> 14:10.643
lt's a lot to take in
all at once,

14:10.716 --> 14:12.843
and l'm really tired.

14:12.918 --> 14:15.478
We could both
use some sleep.

14:15.554 --> 14:18.318
Computer, dim the lights.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.629
Somebody make sure

14:24.697 --> 14:26.130
those coals
are completely out.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.029
l'll get it, Dad.

14:28.100 --> 14:29.499
You kids be careful

14:29.602 --> 14:31.297
and be back before sunset.

14:31.403 --> 14:33.337
And bring your appetites--
we're having fish for dinner.

14:33.405 --> 14:34.872
lf you two
can catch any.

14:34.940 --> 14:36.908
Dad, l increased
the field strength

14:37.076 --> 14:38.407
of the targeting lure.

14:38.477 --> 14:42.243
Ooh, those fish
don't stand a chance.

14:42.314 --> 14:43.406
You better get going.

14:43.482 --> 14:45.279
Your cousins aren't
going to wait forever.

14:45.351 --> 14:46.545
l was thinking--

14:46.619 --> 14:48.849
maybe l could go fishing
with you and Uncle Carl.

14:48.921 --> 14:51.355
l thought you were
looking forward to the hike?

14:51.423 --> 14:52.447
Just the kids.

14:52.524 --> 14:53.889
No dads to slow you down.

14:53.959 --> 14:56.587
They don't like me.

14:56.662 --> 14:58.527
Why would you say that?

14:58.597 --> 15:00.497
Because it's true.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.124
Come on, B'Elanna, let's go.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.036
See?

15:07.640 --> 15:09.301
Now, go on.

15:09.375 --> 15:10.603
Have a good time.

15:10.676 --> 15:11.665
Dad?

15:12.778 --> 15:14.803
What is it?

15:14.880 --> 15:17.474
Nothing.

15:28.794 --> 15:30.489
Relax.

15:30.562 --> 15:31.824
We're not that late.

15:31.897 --> 15:33.797
The Doctor
scheduled me at 0800.

15:33.866 --> 15:36.494
You still have time for my
favorite gourmet breakfast--

15:36.602 --> 15:37.626
peanut butter toast.

15:37.736 --> 15:38.896
l'm too tired to eat.

15:39.071 --> 15:40.629
Well, if you're having
trouble sleeping now,

15:40.739 --> 15:42.900
wait till those
0200 feedings come around.

15:43.008 --> 15:44.339
You'll be in charge of those.

15:44.410 --> 15:46.537
l can't wait.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.945
Look, uh, you don't
have to come with me.

15:50.049 --> 15:51.949
lt's a minor procedure.

15:52.017 --> 15:55.077
Wouldn't you like
some moral support?

15:55.154 --> 15:57.213
l'm not an invalid.

15:57.289 --> 16:00.383
Well, in that case,
you're on your own.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.359
That goes for breakfast, too.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.593
l've been expanding my database
in obstetrics and pediatrics.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.601
You haven't found another
problem, have you?

16:10.669 --> 16:11.658
No, not at all,

16:11.770 --> 16:12.828
but l have put together

16:13.005 --> 16:14.563
a prenatal enrichment program.

16:14.673 --> 16:16.300
Why am l not surprised?

16:16.375 --> 16:19.173
l'd like to start with
trans-abdominal vocalization.

16:19.244 --> 16:20.336
Let me guess.

16:20.412 --> 16:21.811
You're going to
sing to my fetus.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.177
Through a diatonal amplifier.

16:23.248 --> 16:24.579
lt's quite safe,
and it should

16:24.650 --> 16:26.481
enhance the child's
mathematical abilities.

16:26.552 --> 16:28.110
Can we talk
about this later?

16:28.187 --> 16:29.313
Absolutely...

16:29.388 --> 16:31.515
at our first
parenting class.

16:31.590 --> 16:32.887
Parenting class.

16:33.025 --> 16:34.822
Birthing techniques,
feeding options,

16:34.893 --> 16:35.825
bonding strategies.

16:35.894 --> 16:36.883
lt's not all hard work, though.

16:37.029 --> 16:38.428
We'll have ample time for fun.

16:38.497 --> 16:39.623
Could we get on with it?

16:39.698 --> 16:42.292
Certainly.

16:42.401 --> 16:44.369
Computer, dim lights.

16:44.436 --> 16:46.904
l hope you don't expect me
to sleep through this.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.166
Of course not.

16:48.273 --> 16:50.707
The darkness encourages
vascular dilation.

16:50.776 --> 16:52.835
Now, you may feel
a slight tingling.

16:52.911 --> 16:54.970
Please remain as
still as possible.

16:59.118 --> 17:00.585
B'Elanna, come have lunch.

17:00.686 --> 17:01.653
That's okay.

17:01.687 --> 17:02.619
l'm not hungry.

17:02.688 --> 17:03.950
You better eat while you can.

17:04.022 --> 17:06.320
You know our dads aren't
going to catch any fish.

17:14.366 --> 17:15.731
Here.

17:15.834 --> 17:16.732
Thanks.

17:16.835 --> 17:17.767
Your mom wasn't sure

17:17.836 --> 17:18.928
you'd be able
to come this weekend.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.733
l had a lot of schoolwork.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.136
Well, l'm glad you made it.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.867
That's nice of you to say.

17:23.942 --> 17:25.272
Hey, B'Elanna, can
you hand me a drink?

17:25.344 --> 17:26.675
Okay.

17:28.747 --> 17:30.681
Thanks.

17:37.356 --> 17:39.119
My teacher said Klingons
like live food.

17:39.191 --> 17:41.182
Hey, stop it! Stop.

17:41.260 --> 17:43.421
lt was just a joke.

17:43.495 --> 17:44.826
lt was a stupid joke, Dean.

17:44.963 --> 17:47.193
He's always doing stuff
like that to me.

17:48.567 --> 17:49.534
Don't be mad, B'Elanna.

17:49.635 --> 17:51.603
B'Elanna, wait!

17:51.670 --> 17:53.194
Computer, raise lights.

17:56.809 --> 17:58.606
Your daughter's spinal column

17:58.677 --> 18:00.167
is now perfectly aligned.

18:00.245 --> 18:01.439
ls she going to be all right?

18:01.513 --> 18:02.775
Better than all right

18:02.848 --> 18:05.043
if her parents
are any indication.

18:16.728 --> 18:20.323
Computer, access
B'Elanna Torres' medical file.

18:20.399 --> 18:22.526
File accessed.

18:22.634 --> 18:26.161
Project a holographic image
of the baby.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.706
Now, extrapolate what
the child's facial features

18:32.778 --> 18:36.771
will look like...
at 12 years old.

18:44.790 --> 18:48.453
Display the fetus genome.

18:48.527 --> 18:51.087
Delete the following
gene sequences.

18:54.833 --> 18:57.461
Extrapolate what
the child would look like

18:57.569 --> 18:59.127
with those genetic changes.

19:04.109 --> 19:06.168
Delete the following sequences.

19:08.947 --> 19:10.676
Extrapolate.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.662
Save changes.

19:29.201 --> 19:31.829
Restrict access to this file;

19:31.937 --> 19:33.996
B'Elanna Torres only.

19:40.812 --> 19:42.871
There's no valid
medical reason

19:42.948 --> 19:44.142
to do what you're proposing.

19:44.216 --> 19:45.148
l disagree.

19:45.217 --> 19:47.708
You want to delete
entire DNA sequences.

19:47.786 --> 19:50.550
The genes that create
redundant organs, for example.

19:50.622 --> 19:51.646
They're superfluous.

19:51.723 --> 19:53.987
Those redundancies
are there for a reason.

19:54.059 --> 19:56.493
Does my daughter need
a third lung to survive?

19:56.562 --> 19:59.224
Strictly speaking, no,
but having it may be beneficial.

19:59.298 --> 20:01.562
Some geneticists believe
the extra lung evolved

20:01.633 --> 20:04.158
to give Klingons greater stamina
on the battlefield.

20:04.269 --> 20:06.897
My daughter is not going
to be a Klingon warrior.

20:07.005 --> 20:08.563
With all due respect,
you have no idea

20:08.674 --> 20:10.073
what your daughter's
going to be!

20:13.111 --> 20:15.545
What if she develops
an interest in athletics?

20:15.614 --> 20:17.946
Greater lung capacity
would be an advantage.

20:18.016 --> 20:19.677
The point is, there's no reason

20:19.751 --> 20:21.719
to arbitrarily remove
genetic traits.

20:21.787 --> 20:23.379
lt's not arbitrary!

20:23.455 --> 20:24.945
lt's preventive.

20:25.023 --> 20:26.115
How so?

20:26.191 --> 20:27.249
That third lung could

20:27.326 --> 20:28.588
become diseased, couldn't it?

20:28.660 --> 20:29.592
l suppose.

20:29.661 --> 20:30.685
Then what l'm suggesting

20:30.762 --> 20:31.956
is no different than

20:32.097 --> 20:34.224
removing an appendix
before it becomes inflamed.

20:34.299 --> 20:36.529
Why tamper with
biological systems

20:36.635 --> 20:38.159
that have evolved over eons?

20:38.270 --> 20:40.602
Like curvature of the spine?

20:44.142 --> 20:47.873
lf l make these changes,
it'll affect her appearance.

20:47.946 --> 20:50.107
l'm aware of that.

20:50.182 --> 20:51.479
Are you also aware

20:51.550 --> 20:56.010
that some of these genes
influence behavior, personality?

20:56.088 --> 20:58.852
None of that's as important
as her health.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.084
What does Tom think
about all this?

21:03.161 --> 21:05.891
l wanted to see
what you thought first.

21:05.964 --> 21:08.262
Well, as you can see,
l'm very dubious.

21:08.333 --> 21:12.702
Look, l've done statistical
analyses, epidemiology.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.898
At least review my work.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.338
All right, l'll look at it.

21:18.710 --> 21:20.678
But in the meantime...

21:22.147 --> 21:25.310
l suggest you have a talk
with your husband.

21:25.417 --> 21:27.112
Absolutely not.

21:27.185 --> 21:29.949
This is our child's health
we're talking about.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.455
No, it's more than that.

21:31.523 --> 21:33.684
You want to change who she is.

21:33.759 --> 21:36.455
Her individuality, her...

21:40.532 --> 21:43.160
You don't want her
to be Klingon.

21:44.269 --> 21:46.965
That's what this is
really about, isn't it?

21:47.072 --> 21:48.061
You're trying

21:48.173 --> 21:49.572
to protect her
from being Klingon,

21:49.641 --> 21:51.768
because you had a rough time
when you were a kid.

21:51.843 --> 21:54.971
l was treated like a monster.

21:55.047 --> 21:57.914
That isn't going to happen
to our daughter.

21:57.983 --> 22:01.851
Everyone on Voyager will accept
her for who she really is.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.013
That's easy for you to say.
You're human.

22:04.089 --> 22:05.852
Meaning what, exactly?

22:05.924 --> 22:09.485
Meaning you don't
understand what it's like.

22:10.762 --> 22:14.220
Okay, then... tell me.

22:14.299 --> 22:18.497
When the people around you
are all one way and you're not,

22:18.603 --> 22:20.468
you can't help feeling

22:20.539 --> 22:23.770
like there's
something wrong with you.

22:23.842 --> 22:27.334
But Voyager isn't just one way.

22:27.412 --> 22:29.573
We've got Bajorans, Vulcans

22:29.648 --> 22:31.548
a Talaxian...

22:31.616 --> 22:33.743
And 140 humans.

22:33.819 --> 22:36.481
Our daughter is going
to have a mixed heritage,

22:36.555 --> 22:37.783
just like her mother.

22:37.856 --> 22:39.915
lt's something
you'll have in common,

22:39.991 --> 22:41.856
something she should
be proud of.

22:41.927 --> 22:42.916
Why destroy that?

22:42.994 --> 22:45.121
l'm not destroying anything!

22:45.197 --> 22:47.757
Gene resequencing
isn't a weapon.

22:47.833 --> 22:50.461
lt's a tool...
like a hyperspanner!

22:50.569 --> 22:53.766
She's not a machine.
She's our daughter.

22:55.741 --> 22:58.335
l'm not exactly sure
what you want me to do.

22:58.410 --> 22:59.934
l want you to
order the Doctor

23:00.011 --> 23:01.501
to genetically
alter my child.

23:01.613 --> 23:03.638
Do you see what l'm
dealing with here?

23:03.682 --> 23:06.446
What you're asking for
is ethically questionable.

23:06.518 --> 23:09.715
The Doctor has reservations,
your husband is against it.

23:09.788 --> 23:12.188
l only want to do
what you did...

23:13.258 --> 23:15.021
...for Seven of Nine.

23:15.093 --> 23:17.323
l beg your pardon?

23:17.396 --> 23:19.023
You had her implants removed.

23:19.097 --> 23:20.655
l don't see the connection.

23:20.732 --> 23:22.256
You altered her physiology.

23:22.334 --> 23:24.063
You changed who she was.

23:24.169 --> 23:26.364
l was acting
in her best interests.

23:26.471 --> 23:27.403
That's all l'm doing.

23:27.472 --> 23:28.404
Seven was born human.

23:28.473 --> 23:30.407
The Captain just helped

23:30.475 --> 23:31.806
to restore her
original physiology.

23:31.877 --> 23:33.504
And gave her a much better
life in the process.

23:33.578 --> 23:34.772
Our child isn't even born yet.

23:34.846 --> 23:36.871
How do you know what's going
to make her life better?

23:36.948 --> 23:39.212
l just don't want her
to start at a disadvantage.

23:39.284 --> 23:42.185
Look, the Doctor said you might
experience mood swings...

23:42.254 --> 23:43.778
That's it.
Just dismiss my argument

23:43.855 --> 23:45.379
as some kind
of hormonal outburst!

23:45.457 --> 23:46.651
l didn't mean that!

23:46.725 --> 23:48.693
Stop it, both of you.

23:53.031 --> 23:56.057
The biggest problem
you two have isn't ethical...

23:56.168 --> 23:58.136
it's marital.

23:58.236 --> 24:00.830
l'm happy to offer
you advice as a friend,

24:00.939 --> 24:02.133
but as your Captain,

24:02.240 --> 24:04.868
l am not going to overrule
the Chief Medical Officer.

24:05.010 --> 24:06.705
You two need to work this out.

24:12.417 --> 24:14.009
B'Elanna...

24:14.085 --> 24:15.382
What?

24:15.454 --> 24:16.853
You heard the Captain.

24:16.922 --> 24:17.980
We have to work this out.

24:18.056 --> 24:19.250
There's nothing to work out.

24:19.324 --> 24:20.552
You're getting what you want.

24:20.625 --> 24:21.592
What l want is to have

24:21.660 --> 24:23.252
a civilized discussion
with my wife.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.661
Maybe a change
of scenery would help.

24:25.730 --> 24:26.594
How about the holodeck?

24:26.665 --> 24:27.996
That's your solution
to everything.

24:28.066 --> 24:29.033
At least l'm trying.

24:29.134 --> 24:30.726
Look, l don't care
where we do it,

24:30.836 --> 24:32.326
but we have to talk
this out...

24:32.437 --> 24:33.461
l am tired of talking,

24:33.572 --> 24:35.062
all right?

24:51.623 --> 24:53.887
Do l need a reservation?

24:53.959 --> 24:55.551
What happened?

24:55.627 --> 24:57.959
l think B'Elanna and l
need some time apart.

24:58.063 --> 25:00.054
My couch is your couch.

25:03.835 --> 25:04.995
She's barely pregnant

25:05.103 --> 25:07.435
and already we're having
a major crisis.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.201
You'll make up. You always do.

25:09.274 --> 25:10.764
Yeah, but that's what
worries me.

25:10.876 --> 25:12.571
We're always fighting
and making up.

25:12.644 --> 25:14.612
How's that going
to affect our daughter?

25:14.679 --> 25:16.579
She's going to have
a great life.

25:16.648 --> 25:18.582
Piloting the ship from your lap,

25:18.650 --> 25:20.880
battling Dr. Chaotica
on the holodeck.

25:20.986 --> 25:24.752
Yeah, unless B'Elanna thinks
battling is too Klingon.

25:24.823 --> 25:27.348
She's always been sensitive
about being part Klingon.

25:27.425 --> 25:28.483
You know that.

25:28.560 --> 25:29.891
That doesn't give her the right

25:29.995 --> 25:31.986
to turn our child
into a science experiment.

25:32.063 --> 25:35.362
But it does explain why
this is so important to her.

25:37.469 --> 25:39.096
What am l supposed to do?

25:40.539 --> 25:42.769
Maybe you should tell
her you understand.

25:42.841 --> 25:44.206
What good would that do?

25:45.977 --> 25:47.672
lt might make her
less defensive,

25:47.746 --> 25:49.441
and then maybe
it would be easier

25:49.514 --> 25:51.277
for her to see
your point of view.

25:51.349 --> 25:54.944
Yeah? What if she can't?

25:56.254 --> 25:58.950
Like l said,
my couch is your couch.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.440
She should be back by now.

26:18.510 --> 26:21.104
Nobody has any idea
where she went?

26:21.179 --> 26:22.669
She just ran off down there.

26:22.747 --> 26:24.339
l'm-l'm going to go
look for her.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.543
Uncle John?

26:26.618 --> 26:28.279
Yeah?

26:28.353 --> 26:30.583
l... it...

26:31.623 --> 26:33.147
B'Elanna.

26:33.224 --> 26:34.452
Where have you been?

26:35.894 --> 26:37.657
l'm sorry.

26:37.729 --> 26:39.890
l got kind of... separated.

26:40.031 --> 26:41.464
lt was our fault.

26:41.533 --> 26:42.898
lt was Dean's fault.

26:43.034 --> 26:45.127
He put a worm in her sandwich.

26:45.236 --> 26:47.466
l was just kidding.

26:47.572 --> 26:49.597
l'm really sorry.

26:49.708 --> 26:51.676
Forget it.

26:53.678 --> 26:56.613
Come on. Let's get
dinner started.

27:03.421 --> 27:05.821
You want to talk about it?

27:05.924 --> 27:07.050
l just wish...

27:07.125 --> 27:08.057
You wish what?

27:08.126 --> 27:09.787
l wish l weren't Klingon.

27:09.861 --> 27:11.761
Now, why would you say that?

27:11.830 --> 27:13.661
Because everyone
makes fun of me.

27:13.732 --> 27:14.994
Who's everyone?

27:15.066 --> 27:17.830
Dean, kids at school.

27:17.936 --> 27:19.870
They all hate me.

27:20.939 --> 27:21.997
Did l ever tell you

27:22.107 --> 27:24.667
what the kids at my school
used to call me?

27:26.378 --> 27:30.041
l used to fall asleep
in class all the time,

27:30.115 --> 27:33.812
so instead of John Torres,
they called me John ''Snore-ez.''

27:33.885 --> 27:36.080
lt's not the same thing.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.519
Of course it is.

27:37.589 --> 27:38.783
Kids tease each other.

27:38.857 --> 27:40.119
They can be very cruel,

27:40.191 --> 27:42.284
but it doesn't mean
that they hate you

27:42.360 --> 27:44.123
or that they hate Klingons.

27:44.195 --> 27:45.662
You don't understand!

27:45.730 --> 27:48.893
l think l do.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.163
You have to learn to be
a little less sensitive.

27:53.772 --> 27:55.535
Fine.

27:56.741 --> 27:58.675
Now come on.
Uncle Carl's going to tell

27:58.743 --> 28:00.267
one of his famous fish stories.

28:00.378 --> 28:03.176
l'd rather just read.

28:04.716 --> 28:06.684
Suit yourself.

28:13.358 --> 28:15.622
Did you know there
are fish around here

28:15.694 --> 28:16.626
that have wings?

28:16.695 --> 28:18.128
Flying fish?

28:18.196 --> 28:20.289
lt's true. l'm telling you.
We saw one.

28:20.365 --> 28:21.457
Oh, yeah.

28:21.533 --> 28:22.966
Really?

28:23.068 --> 28:25.002
John, didn't we see
a flying fish today?

28:25.070 --> 28:26.298
We sure did.

28:26.404 --> 28:28.167
Jumped five feet in the air,
flew right into my lap.

28:28.239 --> 28:30.673
Oh, no!

28:30.742 --> 28:32.369
l jumped into
Uncle John's lap.

28:59.704 --> 29:01.228
Everybody asleep?

29:01.339 --> 29:04.035
They were exhausted.

29:04.109 --> 29:05.440
Coffee?

29:05.510 --> 29:06.670
Sure.

29:07.979 --> 29:09.446
Listen, l'm sorry.

29:09.514 --> 29:10.446
For what?

29:10.515 --> 29:12.380
The way Dean treated B'Elanna.

29:12.450 --> 29:13.678
l had a talk with him.

29:13.752 --> 29:17.449
He was just doing
what 1 1-year-olds do.

29:17.522 --> 29:21.322
l'm sure B'Elanna overreacted.

29:21.392 --> 29:23.826
What makes you say that?

29:23.895 --> 29:25.760
She's too damn sensitive.

29:25.830 --> 29:26.819
What do you mean?

29:26.898 --> 29:27.830
She's a great kid.

29:27.899 --> 29:29.366
You haven't been
around her much

29:29.467 --> 29:30.559
the last couple of years.

29:30.668 --> 29:35.162
She's gotten moody,
unpredictable, argumentative.

29:35.273 --> 29:36.331
Just like her mother.

29:36.441 --> 29:39.604
l thought you loved
Miral's... intensity.

29:39.677 --> 29:41.975
Everything's become
a fight with her.

29:42.046 --> 29:43.536
l guess the older l get,

29:43.615 --> 29:45.776
the less intensity
l can handle.

29:45.850 --> 29:46.874
You know, it's funny

29:46.985 --> 29:49.317
how Mom and Dad
always turn out to be right.

29:49.387 --> 29:50.615
What do you mean?

29:50.688 --> 29:53.623
Mom warned me
not to marry Miral.

29:53.691 --> 29:55.352
Mom loved Miral.

29:55.426 --> 29:56.688
Sure, she did,

29:56.761 --> 30:00.128
but she never thought
l had the constitution

30:00.198 --> 30:02.393
to live with a Klingon...

30:02.467 --> 30:05.436
and now l'm living
with two of them.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.266
Taya.

30:09.374 --> 30:11.069
What?

30:11.142 --> 30:14.737
''Taya.'' lt's the feminine
form of ''Chakotay.''

30:14.813 --> 30:16.280
What do you think?

30:16.347 --> 30:17.939
l'll add it to the list,

30:18.016 --> 30:19.415
right after ''Floxia.''

30:19.484 --> 30:20.576
Neelix suggested that one.

30:20.652 --> 30:21.914
lt's number 32.

30:21.986 --> 30:23.613
On second thought,
you and Tom ought

30:23.688 --> 30:24.712
to come up with your own name.

30:26.291 --> 30:29.260
l knew there was a reason
l always liked you.

30:29.327 --> 30:32.057
You look like
you've been up all night.

30:32.130 --> 30:33.620
Want to get some coffee?

30:33.698 --> 30:36.223
That's the best offer
l've had all week.

30:38.703 --> 30:40.432
Morning.

30:40.538 --> 30:41.630
Hi.

30:41.739 --> 30:44.367
Join us for breakfast?

30:46.878 --> 30:47.810
You know what?

30:47.879 --> 30:48.846
l forgot my padd.

30:48.913 --> 30:50.471
Why don't you two go ahead?

30:50.548 --> 30:51.845
l'll meet you in the Mess Hall.

30:53.885 --> 30:56.012
So, how are you today?

30:56.087 --> 31:00.353
l haven't changed my mind,
if that's what you mean.

31:00.425 --> 31:03.223
No, what l meant was,
how are you?

31:03.294 --> 31:06.354
l've been better,
but l'll get over it.

31:06.431 --> 31:12.028
You know, Harry has the
lumpiest pillows on the ship.

31:12.136 --> 31:16.129
He snores, keeps
the room way too hot.

31:18.476 --> 31:19.773
l missed you.

31:19.844 --> 31:22.711
Me, too.

31:24.816 --> 31:27.717
l still owe you that slice
of peanut butter toast.

31:27.785 --> 31:31.221
Why don't we go back to our
quarters, fire up the toaster?

31:31.289 --> 31:32.449
Sounds nice.

31:32.523 --> 31:35.219
Lieutenant Torres,
Lieutenant Paris,

31:35.293 --> 31:36.988
please report to Sick Bay.

31:40.164 --> 31:41.859
l've reviewed
the data you gave me,

31:41.933 --> 31:43.730
and l've also done
my own analysis.

31:43.835 --> 31:45.132
Skip the details, Doctor.

31:45.236 --> 31:48.467
You've already made it clear
what you think of my proposal.

31:48.539 --> 31:50.564
Actually, l've
changed my opinion.

31:50.675 --> 31:51.607
What?

31:51.676 --> 31:54.338
The genetic alterations
you've suggested

31:54.412 --> 31:55.743
are necessary.

31:55.880 --> 31:58.178
On what grounds?

31:58.249 --> 32:01.946
The ''clash'' l mentioned between
Klingon and human metabolism.

32:02.053 --> 32:04.248
lt's more extensive
than l realized.

32:04.289 --> 32:05.620
How extensive?

32:05.690 --> 32:06.884
Theoretically,

32:06.991 --> 32:09.551
it could lead
to complete metabolic failure.

32:09.627 --> 32:11.117
But you can fix it?

32:11.195 --> 32:12.321
By eliminating

32:12.397 --> 32:14.126
most of her Klingon
genetic material.

32:14.198 --> 32:16.132
Are you sure about all of this?

32:16.234 --> 32:17.895
My analysis was quite thorough.

32:18.069 --> 32:20.629
Of course, if our
circumstances were different,

32:20.738 --> 32:23.206
you would be free to seek
a second opinion.

32:23.274 --> 32:24.605
No offense, Doc,

32:24.676 --> 32:28.942
but l am just trying
to understand what's going on.

32:29.047 --> 32:30.947
You're welcome
to review my findings,

32:31.015 --> 32:32.846
but let me stress

32:32.917 --> 32:35.852
it would be unwise
to delay this too long.

32:35.920 --> 32:36.944
Why?

32:37.055 --> 32:38.317
The fetus is at a critical

32:38.389 --> 32:39.549
stage of development.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.216
Antibodies have begun to form.

32:44.362 --> 32:45.829
How long do we have?

32:45.897 --> 32:48.627
l've scheduled the procedure
for tomorrow morning,

32:48.700 --> 32:49.894
with your permission.

32:57.208 --> 32:58.436
l want to thank you both

32:58.509 --> 33:00.409
for helping B'Elanna
when she fainted.

33:00.511 --> 33:02.103
l'm glad it wasn't a parasite.

33:02.146 --> 33:03.477
Well, you probably

33:03.548 --> 33:05.072
don't know this,
but there may be

33:05.149 --> 33:06.673
some problems
with the pregnancy.

33:06.751 --> 33:08.150
l'm sorry to hear that.

33:08.219 --> 33:11.484
The Doctor suggested
a treatment for the baby,

33:11.556 --> 33:14.684
but his findings are very
confusing... at least to me.

33:14.759 --> 33:16.624
You have
some expertise in genetics.

33:16.694 --> 33:18.457
Do you mind taking
a look at this?

33:18.529 --> 33:19.757
Of course not.

33:19.831 --> 33:21.822
Whatever the problem is,

33:21.899 --> 33:25.801
l have no doubt
the Doctor will solve it.

33:25.870 --> 33:27.337
l hope you're right.

33:27.438 --> 33:29.770
Your confusion
is understandable.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.900
There's a
computational error.

33:32.010 --> 33:35.138
lt's not like the Doctor
to make a mistake.

33:35.213 --> 33:36.840
l didn't think
that was possible,

33:36.914 --> 33:39.576
unless there's some sort
of glitch in his program.

33:39.650 --> 33:40.912
l'll run a diagnostic.

33:40.985 --> 33:42.418
Thank you.

33:42.487 --> 33:44.546
Please tell Lieutenant Torres

33:44.622 --> 33:46.886
if there's anything l can do...

33:46.958 --> 33:49.051
l'll let her know. Thanks.

33:49.127 --> 33:50.424
lt appears to be

33:50.495 --> 33:51.723
more than a glitch.

33:51.796 --> 33:55.288
l believe the Doctor's program
has been tampered with.

33:57.535 --> 34:00.060
B'Elanna, this is Tom. Respond.

34:00.171 --> 34:03.004
Computer,
locate Lieutenant Torres.

34:03.074 --> 34:05.542
Lieutenant Torres
is in Sick Bay.

34:08.545 --> 34:09.570
Frankly, l'm relieved

34:09.647 --> 34:12.013
you decided not to wait
till the last minute.

34:12.083 --> 34:15.449
Once this is behind us,
l'm sure we'll all feel better.

34:21.958 --> 34:24.893
Someone's blocked
communications to Sick Bay.

34:24.996 --> 34:27.726
See if you can
deactivate the Doctor.

34:27.799 --> 34:30.029
Access to his program
has been restricted.

34:30.134 --> 34:31.396
Keep trying.

34:31.502 --> 34:32.434
Paris to Tuvok.

34:32.503 --> 34:33.435
Go ahead.

34:33.504 --> 34:35.472
Meet me in Sick Bay.

34:35.572 --> 34:37.598
Why would she alter
the Doctor's program?

34:37.708 --> 34:38.732
To change his mind

34:38.842 --> 34:40.208
about the medical procedure.

34:40.277 --> 34:42.610
Computer, open Sick Bay doors.

34:42.679 --> 34:44.272
Unable to comply.

34:45.750 --> 34:49.618
Override.
Authorization: Tuvok-pi-alpha.

34:49.687 --> 34:52.155
Authorization denied.

34:57.027 --> 34:58.757
Doctor, stop
what you're doing.

34:58.830 --> 35:01.355
You're interrupting
a medical procedure.

35:01.466 --> 35:03.195
Your program
has been altered.

35:03.267 --> 35:04.734
What do you mean, altered?

35:04.836 --> 35:06.360
lgnore him.

35:06.471 --> 35:08.029
B'Elanna, this
is completely irrational.

35:08.139 --> 35:10.403
Will someone please tell me
what's going on?

35:10.475 --> 35:12.238
l'm your patient.
Your first duty

35:12.310 --> 35:13.538
is to me and my baby.

35:13.611 --> 35:14.669
Tuvok to Bridge.

35:14.745 --> 35:15.803
Kim here.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.643
There's a force field
in Sick Bay.

35:17.715 --> 35:18.739
l can't deactivate it.

35:18.816 --> 35:20.078
Cut power to the EPS relay

35:20.151 --> 35:21.880
surrounding the Surgical Bay.

35:21.986 --> 35:24.147
Access has been restricted.

35:24.222 --> 35:25.712
l'll have to bypass them.

35:25.790 --> 35:28.486
You said it could be dangerous
to delay the procedure.

35:28.559 --> 35:30.891
She's manipulating you, Doc,
in more ways than one.

35:30.995 --> 35:32.019
l'm sorry, Lieutenant,

35:32.096 --> 35:34.155
but if there's something
wrong with my program...

35:34.232 --> 35:36.564
There's nothing wrong
with your program!

35:36.634 --> 35:39.364
l'm cutting power
to the Surgical Bay now.

35:42.707 --> 35:44.368
l suggest we deactivate
your program,

35:44.442 --> 35:48.469
until we determine
the extent of the alterations.

35:50.381 --> 35:51.939
l understand.

35:52.083 --> 35:54.483
Computer, deactivate EMH.

35:55.553 --> 35:57.851
You had no right to interfere.

35:57.955 --> 36:00.480
Tuvok, would you mind
giving us a minute?

36:05.997 --> 36:07.362
l never thought

36:07.431 --> 36:08.989
you would go this far.

36:09.066 --> 36:10.761
l don't know what
you're talking about.

36:10.868 --> 36:12.995
Reprogramming the Doctor?

36:13.104 --> 36:14.662
l upgraded his program,

36:14.772 --> 36:17.366
so he could understand
what had to be done.

36:17.475 --> 36:19.568
You mean
to reconfigure our baby

36:19.644 --> 36:22.078
so she wouldn't be
treated like a monster.

36:22.146 --> 36:25.013
lt's not just about the
way she'll be treated!

36:25.082 --> 36:26.049
What else

36:26.117 --> 36:27.209
is it about, then?!

36:27.285 --> 36:29.150
Come on, B'Elanna, tell me!

36:29.220 --> 36:31.051
Forget it.

36:31.122 --> 36:32.885
No, no. We're not
going to forget it.

36:32.957 --> 36:34.788
We're going to talk
about this right now.

36:34.859 --> 36:36.121
Stop telling me what to do!

36:36.194 --> 36:37.388
You're not my father!

36:42.033 --> 36:44.001
What are you talking about?

36:46.837 --> 36:48.270
Look, my fath...

36:49.340 --> 36:51.501
What?

36:51.576 --> 36:53.476
What about him?

36:54.946 --> 36:57.938
We were inseparable.

36:58.082 --> 37:01.279
He spoiled me
and l worshipped him,

37:01.385 --> 37:03.512
but the older l got...

37:03.554 --> 37:06.682
we just grew apart.

37:09.493 --> 37:14.396
He ended up organizing this
camping trip with my cousins.

37:14.465 --> 37:17.229
l guess he just wanted to--

37:17.335 --> 37:20.827
l don't know--
make things better again.

37:20.938 --> 37:22.200
But it didn't.

37:22.273 --> 37:24.241
lt was awful.

37:26.577 --> 37:28.511
l ended up trying to run away.

37:28.579 --> 37:30.877
B'Elanna?

37:30.948 --> 37:32.472
What are you doing?

37:32.550 --> 37:35.348
lt was so stupid.

37:35.419 --> 37:38.877
l mean, where was l going to go?

37:39.023 --> 37:42.186
You probably just
wanted him to stop you.

37:44.462 --> 37:46.555
Well, he did.

37:46.631 --> 37:48.622
Don't touch me.

37:48.699 --> 37:50.530
B'Elanna, what's wrong?

37:50.635 --> 37:52.603
You know what's wrong.

37:52.670 --> 37:54.865
No, l don't.

37:54.972 --> 37:58.840
Maybe l'm just being moody
and unpredictable.

37:58.909 --> 38:00.706
What are you talking about?

38:00.811 --> 38:03.371
l heard what you said
to Uncle Carl.

38:05.783 --> 38:09.219
You shouldn't be listening
to private conversations.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.847
And you shouldn't have said
what you did about Mommy!

38:30.608 --> 38:31.632
B'Elanna...

38:31.742 --> 38:33.073
listen to me.

38:33.144 --> 38:36.045
Your mother and l
are having problems, but...

38:36.113 --> 38:38.013
You don't love her anymore.

38:38.082 --> 38:39.379
That's not true.

38:39.450 --> 38:41.384
Yes, it is,
and you don't love me, either.

38:41.452 --> 38:42.384
B'Elanna...

38:42.453 --> 38:43.385
You're no different

38:43.454 --> 38:44.512
than anyone else.

38:44.588 --> 38:45.885
You don't like Klingons.
You said it.

38:46.023 --> 38:48.583
You are twisting my words,
B'Elanna.

38:48.659 --> 38:49.751
Maybe he was right.

38:49.827 --> 38:51.192
Maybe you misunderstood.

38:51.262 --> 38:53.457
No, l know what l heard.

38:53.531 --> 38:54.759
lt made me so angry!

38:54.832 --> 38:57.460
You had a right to be,
after the things he said.

38:57.568 --> 38:59.536
lt's not what he said.

38:59.603 --> 39:01.127
lt's what l said.

39:01.238 --> 39:02.762
lf you can't stand living
with us,

39:02.940 --> 39:04.669
then why don't you just leave?!

39:06.544 --> 39:09.570
And that's exactly what he did.

39:09.647 --> 39:11.012
Oh, B'Elanna...

39:11.082 --> 39:14.813
12 days later...

39:14.919 --> 39:17.547
and he never came back.

39:17.621 --> 39:20.055
You can't blame yourself
for that.

39:20.124 --> 39:21.716
Why not?

39:21.792 --> 39:27.287
Because... he was obviously
unhappy about his marriage.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.959
He didn't leave
just because you told him to.

39:30.067 --> 39:32.035
You don't know that.

39:33.137 --> 39:35.731
Look, whatever the reason was,

39:35.840 --> 39:40.777
l'm sure it was a horrible thing
for you to live with.

39:47.351 --> 39:48.318
Wait a minute.

39:48.386 --> 39:49.478
You don't think...

39:52.356 --> 39:53.687
B'Elanna,

39:53.758 --> 39:55.885
l am never going
to leave you.

39:55.960 --> 39:59.157
You say that now...

39:59.230 --> 40:02.199
but think about how hard it is
to live with one Klingon.

40:02.266 --> 40:03.824
Pretty soon it'll be two.

40:03.901 --> 40:07.428
And someday l hope
it's three or four.

40:07.538 --> 40:09.335
l mean it,

40:09.407 --> 40:15.175
and l hope that every one
of them is just like you.

40:15.246 --> 40:17.942
B'Elanna...

40:18.082 --> 40:19.913
l am not your father,

40:19.984 --> 40:22.077
and you are not your mother,

40:22.153 --> 40:24.849
and our daughter
is going to be perfect

40:24.922 --> 40:26.856
just the way she is.

40:26.924 --> 40:29.188
You really think so?

40:29.260 --> 40:32.388
l know so.

40:40.938 --> 40:45.568
Medical Officer's Log,
Stardate 54452.6.

40:45.643 --> 40:48.771
Lieutenant Torres
has deleted the alterations

40:48.846 --> 40:50.677
she made to my program.

40:50.748 --> 40:54.411
lt's a relief to be back
to my old self again.

40:54.485 --> 40:56.612
Good morning, Lieutenant.

40:56.687 --> 40:57.881
You're not
feeling ill, are you?

40:57.955 --> 40:59.013
No.

40:59.123 --> 41:01.523
l'm fine.

41:01.625 --> 41:07.086
l just wanted to apologize
for violating your program.

41:09.900 --> 41:12.164
Apology accepted.

41:12.269 --> 41:16.763
Not guilty by reason
of biochemistry.

41:16.874 --> 41:19.775
Nice of you to let
me off the hook,

41:19.844 --> 41:23.940
but biochemistry
isn't an excuse.

41:24.048 --> 41:27.142
l knew exactly
what l was doing.

41:30.354 --> 41:31.946
ls something wrong?

41:32.022 --> 41:34.388
l don't know.

41:39.563 --> 41:42.361
Your baby's kicking.

41:42.433 --> 41:43.957
So soon?

41:44.101 --> 41:45.568
Well, she is part Klingon.

41:47.137 --> 41:49.105
There it is again.

41:51.876 --> 41:53.207
May l?

42:00.284 --> 42:02.514
Feisty little thing, isn't she?

42:02.586 --> 42:05.054
l wonder where
she gets that from.

42:05.122 --> 42:06.350
Speaking of the baby,

42:06.423 --> 42:08.254
l have another request.

42:08.325 --> 42:11.522
Yes?

42:11.595 --> 42:14.587
l wonder if you'd
like to be her godfather.

42:16.634 --> 42:18.363
Neelix wants the job,

42:18.469 --> 42:20.437
but he's already got
Naomi Wildman,

42:20.504 --> 42:23.166
and Chakotay knows less
about raising kids than Harry,

42:23.274 --> 42:24.434
and, and if you think...

42:24.508 --> 42:25.440
l accept.

42:25.509 --> 42:27.340
Thanks.

42:27.411 --> 42:29.936
Thank you.

42:30.080 --> 42:33.641
l was also wondering...

42:33.717 --> 42:36.880
Do you think l could
see her one more time?

42:36.954 --> 42:39.514
The holographic projection,
l mean.

42:39.590 --> 42:41.319
l don't see why not.

43:00.611 --> 43:02.841
She is cute, isn't she?

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
