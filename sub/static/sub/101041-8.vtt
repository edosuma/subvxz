07:23.509 --> 07:25.244
[laughter]

07:25.278 --> 07:27.580
But if we push

07:27.613 --> 07:30.450
his nuts aside...

07:30.483 --> 07:32.084
there's something special
in here.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.253
It's difficult to see
if you're further back.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.889
I can tell by
the lack of response.

07:36.923 --> 07:38.858
[laughter]

07:38.891 --> 07:40.193
Brad, there's something
special in there.

07:40.226 --> 07:42.462
There's a bill in there.
Can you hold out both hands?

07:42.495 --> 07:44.430
Closer, like you're
gonna catch your nuts.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.833
[laughter]

07:46.866 --> 07:49.168
Amongst your nuts,
what do you see?

07:49.202 --> 07:51.270
"My hundred."
Good.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.105
[laughter]

07:53.139 --> 07:55.641
You're too good
for this routine.

07:55.675 --> 07:57.577
Did you write the name Snoopy?
- I did.

07:57.610 --> 07:58.978
- Is that the same bill?
- I wrote Snoopy.

07:59.011 --> 08:00.112
- There it is,
ladies and gentlemen!

08:00.146 --> 08:02.048
[cheers and applause]

08:02.081 --> 08:04.517
Same bill, same guy, same nuts.

08:04.550 --> 08:06.886
Let's give it up
for Brad, everybody.

08:06.919 --> 08:08.521
I'm gonna give you this
as a souvenir.

08:08.554 --> 08:09.922
- Thank you so much.

08:09.956 --> 08:11.891
- And here's a few bucks
for being a good sport.

08:11.924 --> 08:13.092
- Oh!
Thank you so much.

08:13.125 --> 08:14.427
- You're awesome.
Thank you so much.

08:14.460 --> 08:15.561
- My pleasure.

08:15.595 --> 08:16.929
- Keep it going on
for Brad Sherwood,

08:16.963 --> 08:17.964
ladies and gentlemen!

08:17.997 --> 08:19.499
Thank you so much, Brad.

08:19.532 --> 08:21.534
[cheers and applause]
Thank you so much.

08:21.567 --> 08:24.604
- Mike Hammer, everyone!

08:24.637 --> 08:26.839
Oh, thank you so much

08:26.873 --> 08:28.541
for not asking me to volunteer.

08:28.574 --> 08:29.742
- Well, there...

08:29.775 --> 08:31.410
[laughter]

08:31.444 --> 08:33.846
- Do you always abuse
the people you bring on stage?

08:33.880 --> 08:34.847
- Yeah.

08:34.881 --> 08:36.182
I wanted to get Penn,

08:36.215 --> 08:38.017
but they said that wouldn't
be good for my life.

08:38.050 --> 08:40.419
- [laughing]
- So...

08:40.453 --> 08:42.455
- So does it ever go wrong?

08:42.488 --> 08:43.623
- I've had some
weird things happen.

08:43.656 --> 08:45.992
I had a--I do a--a trick

08:46.025 --> 08:47.527
where I bring someone
up on stage.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.228
And I had my hands tied
behind my back.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.396
It's not an escape,

08:50.429 --> 08:52.131
but I'm gonna do
a pickpocket demonstration

08:52.164 --> 08:53.399
with my hands tied.

08:53.432 --> 08:56.602
And the guy tied me up
and then left the stage.

08:56.636 --> 08:57.637
- [laughs]

08:57.670 --> 08:59.839
- And I'm standing there
just tied up.

08:59.872 --> 09:00.907
I told the audience--I said,

09:00.940 --> 09:02.508
"Will someone come up
and untie me?"

09:02.542 --> 09:03.976
But they thought
it was part of the show.

09:04.010 --> 09:05.411
- Oh, my goodness.
- Yeah.

09:05.444 --> 09:06.679
All right.
Well, let's find out

09:06.712 --> 09:08.381
if the boys know how you
did--did your trick.

09:08.414 --> 09:09.482
- Okay.
Thank you.

09:09.515 --> 09:11.017
- Boys.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.351
- It's so--

09:12.385 --> 09:13.819
You know, Brad Sherwood's
an old friend of ours.

09:13.853 --> 09:14.887
- Yeah.

09:14.921 --> 09:16.255
- You're an old friend
of ours.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.057
We were just relaxing
and watching you work.

09:18.090 --> 09:19.759
- Oh, thanks so much, guys.
Thanks for having me back.

09:19.792 --> 09:20.927
- Great time.
- Thank you.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.162
- And I wanna point out

09:23.195 --> 09:24.997
you're at the Four Queens

09:25.031 --> 09:26.499
on Fremont Street...
- Yes.

09:26.532 --> 09:28.067
- Doing magic all the time.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.101
- Yeah.
[cheers and applause]

09:29.135 --> 09:30.970
- I believe

09:31.003 --> 09:32.605
that's the most important thing

09:32.638 --> 09:33.873
you wanted to hear
out of me, right?

09:33.906 --> 09:35.675
- [laughing]

09:35.708 --> 09:37.843
- Once I've said
you're at the Four Queens...

09:37.877 --> 09:39.011
- I can leave!
- Doing magic nightly.

09:39.045 --> 09:40.246
You'll be able to say, "Yep.

09:40.279 --> 09:41.247
They busted me.
Bye."

09:41.280 --> 09:42.315
- They busted me.
See you.

09:42.348 --> 09:44.083
No, I appreciate that.
Thank you so much.

09:44.116 --> 09:45.551
- It's wonderful
to see you again.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.552
- Oh, great to see you.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.954
- I guess I do have to get to

09:47.987 --> 09:49.055
what the show
is actually about.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.289
- No! You don't.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.490
You could just keep talking
about my show.

09:51.524 --> 09:54.260
[laughter]

09:55.995 --> 09:57.630
- But I will say,
last time you were on,

09:57.663 --> 09:59.031
we talked about
a cartoon bunny.

09:59.065 --> 10:00.333
- Yeah.

10:00.366 --> 10:02.168
- And this time, we'll talk
about another comic book.

10:02.201 --> 10:03.869
"Superman."
- Okay.

10:03.903 --> 10:07.773
- Because Superman
is also known as the man of...

10:07.807 --> 10:10.443
Now good-bye.
[laughing]

10:10.476 --> 10:11.811
- See.
He did this last time.

10:11.844 --> 10:13.879
His code is so good,
I don't know what he's saying.

10:13.913 --> 10:15.915
- Welcome to my life.

10:15.948 --> 10:17.183
I never know
what he's saying.

10:17.216 --> 10:18.351
- Oh!
Thank you.

10:18.384 --> 10:19.552
Okay.
Thank you.

10:19.585 --> 10:21.487
- [laughing]
- Thanks, you guys, so much.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.589
They did--they did--no.
I did not fool them.

10:23.623 --> 10:24.857
- Okay.
- But they're awesome.

10:24.890 --> 10:26.092
Thanks so much, you guys.
- Thanks a lot, Mike.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.627
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

10:27.660 --> 10:28.628

17:04.556 --> 17:06.692
- She did sewing studies.

17:08.660 --> 17:10.396
- And then she
discovered magic.

to be out here performing?

that I perform in USA.

- All right.

gets you a quick trophy.

17:48.133 --> 17:50.235
So good.
So beautiful.

17:50.269 --> 17:52.471
And just moves right through.

17:52.504 --> 17:55.541
And goes so much further

17:55.574 --> 17:57.476
than we ever thought
it would go.

17:57.509 --> 17:58.944
We were--we were really happy

17:58.977 --> 18:00.879
with five or six changes.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.649
And you did, I think, 700,000.

18:03.682 --> 18:05.017
[laughter]

18:05.050 --> 18:07.553
Now, we've been doing
this show for seven years,

18:07.586 --> 18:10.722
and quick change

18:10.756 --> 18:13.358
does not seem like magic to us.

18:13.392 --> 18:16.428
We know the basics
of quick change.

18:16.462 --> 18:18.530
But...

18:20.933 --> 18:23.268
This isn't a quick-change act.

18:23.302 --> 18:25.204
This is a magic act.

18:25.237 --> 18:27.773
Because we know how

18:27.806 --> 18:30.576
all quick change is done,

18:30.609 --> 18:32.344
and we do not know

18:32.377 --> 18:35.747
how all your act is done.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.516
There is stuff--

18:37.549 --> 18:40.085
[cheers and applause]

18:40.119 --> 18:44.256
There is stuff in this act

18:44.289 --> 18:48.927
that leaves us
totally mystified.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.963
Completely
and utterly mystified.

18:50.996 --> 18:52.464
- Thank you very much.
Thank you.

18:52.498 --> 18:54.199
[cheers and applause]
- And um, I am--

18:54.233 --> 18:56.135
I don't wanna open
a floodgate here.

18:56.168 --> 18:57.736
This does not mean

18:57.769 --> 18:59.471
that quick-change artists

18:59.505 --> 19:00.939
can come on and fool us.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.375
Because quick-change artists
can't.

19:03.408 --> 19:04.877
Magicians can.

19:04.910 --> 19:07.179
And Lea, we look so forward

19:07.212 --> 19:08.780
to having you
on our show in Vegas.

19:08.814 --> 19:09.982

shouldn't say this,

20:06.238 --> 20:08.040
but when I was 12,

20:08.073 --> 20:10.042
my very first trick
that I built

20:10.075 --> 20:12.244
was a magic eraser

20:12.277 --> 20:15.180
that helped me to pass
a math exam.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.248
Sneaky magic.

20:16.281 --> 20:17.449
That's not really magic,

20:17.482 --> 20:19.151
but it made my life easier.

20:19.184 --> 20:20.619
For sure.

my name is Dante,

21:00.392 --> 21:02.294
and I'm going to do
a magic trick

21:02.327 --> 21:04.296
you have never seen before.

21:04.329 --> 21:06.498
It's the trick
where two cards

21:06.531 --> 21:09.601
and they choose one.

21:09.635 --> 21:12.704
Well, you may have seen it,
but I don't care, okay?

21:12.738 --> 21:14.539
Just tell me stop
when you want, please.

21:14.573 --> 21:15.741
Tell me stop.
Tell me stop.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.542
all: Stop.
Okay.

21:17.576 --> 21:18.910
It's okay
that I can see the card.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.512
We also need two more cards.

21:20.545 --> 21:22.447
The two red kings.
Okay?

21:22.481 --> 21:25.384
So here's one,

21:25.417 --> 21:28.620
and here is the other one.

21:28.654 --> 21:31.156
What this absolute new trick
consist of

21:31.189 --> 21:33.125
is the following, okay?

21:33.158 --> 21:35.727
I'm going to place one
of the kings on top.

21:35.761 --> 21:36.795
Here.

21:36.828 --> 21:38.997
And one of the kings on bottom.

21:39.031 --> 21:41.500
And I'm going to lose this card

21:41.533 --> 21:43.235
here in the middle.

21:43.268 --> 21:45.270
Here.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.005
And I clearly show
that it's still there,

21:47.039 --> 21:48.907
that it has not
been teleported...

21:48.940 --> 21:50.275
yet.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.276
Okay?

21:51.310 --> 21:52.511
Your card lost,

21:52.544 --> 21:53.979
and at the count of three,

21:54.012 --> 21:56.515
the two kings
and your chosen card.

21:56.548 --> 21:59.718
One, two, and three.

21:59.751 --> 22:02.020
The kings and one card.

22:02.054 --> 22:05.891
It can't be other
than your jack of clubs.

22:05.924 --> 22:07.359
Thank you very much.

[cheers and applause]

22:09.161 --> 22:10.595
I know.

22:10.629 --> 22:13.231
Let's go a little farther,
okay?

22:13.265 --> 22:16.234
Place the two kings
carefully like that

22:16.268 --> 22:17.269
on the table.

22:17.302 --> 22:19.471
Carefully, carefully.

22:19.504 --> 22:21.273
Carefully.

22:21.306 --> 22:23.275
Now, I know
what you are thinking.

22:23.308 --> 22:26.111
That I'm hiding something
under the two kings, but no.

22:26.144 --> 22:27.179
Okay?

22:27.212 --> 22:29.047
Carefully like that.

22:29.081 --> 22:32.217
Your card is lost again, okay?

22:32.250 --> 22:37.189
And now with a wave
of my hand,

22:37.222 --> 22:40.659
between the two kings
appears one card

22:40.692 --> 22:43.962
that can't be other
than your jack of clubs.

22:43.995 --> 22:45.564

and totally magical.

22:51.503 --> 22:53.238
- Oh, I--

22:53.271 --> 22:55.974
I know that I'm sneaky,

22:56.007 --> 22:58.844
and you probably think
that I'm still hiding something

22:58.877 --> 23:00.946
under the two kings, right?

23:00.979 --> 23:03.582
But one thing.

23:03.615 --> 23:05.917
Let's get rid of these ones.

23:05.951 --> 23:08.620
And let's take this trick

23:08.653 --> 23:11.590
to the next level.

23:11.623 --> 23:13.358
If you can see
through the kings,

23:13.392 --> 23:16.194
there can be nothing
behind, right?

23:16.228 --> 23:17.763
So...

23:17.796 --> 23:20.499
I'm going to place
your card here.

23:20.532 --> 23:24.035
Your jack of clubs there.

23:24.069 --> 23:27.105
And I'm going to place
the two kings

23:27.139 --> 23:29.307
here in the middle, okay?

23:29.341 --> 23:32.477
I'm going to place it there.

23:32.511 --> 23:34.212
It--it's clear enough.
Isn't it?

23:34.246 --> 23:37.349
There's no cards between
those two kings, right?

23:37.382 --> 23:39.284
There's no cards.

23:39.317 --> 23:42.020
So I just have to wait.

23:42.053 --> 23:44.055
[light music]

23:44.089 --> 23:46.825

23:46.858 --> 23:49.461

23:49.494 --> 23:52.898
Here appears one card...

23:55.467 --> 23:59.304
that can't be other
than your jack of clubs.

23:59.337 --> 24:00.872

when I came here

to do a magic trick

24:10.182 --> 24:11.983

24:19.758 --> 24:21.393
here in the middle...

Okay.

24:22.461 --> 24:25.297
Your jack of clubs.

24:25.330 --> 24:27.098

24:27.132 --> 24:30.035
in which two cards here

24:30.068 --> 24:31.937
without a center

24:31.970 --> 24:34.673
and the selected one.

24:34.706 --> 24:36.541
Okay?

24:36.575 --> 24:38.677
I'm going to do it very slow.

One...

24:40.846 --> 24:42.247
two...

24:42.280 --> 24:43.248

with magic in Spain?

25:07.806 --> 25:08.773

I love all the magicians
in Spain.

go to Spain.

25:13.545 --> 25:14.946
Not to see me.
No.

25:14.980 --> 25:16.781
You can go to Spain
and see very good magicians.

25:16.815 --> 25:18.016
- Yeah.

25:18.049 --> 25:21.186
So what do you like most
about performing live?

25:21.219 --> 25:23.855
- I love the faces

25:23.889 --> 25:25.323
of the audience.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.692

and they say,

- [laughs]

25:29.728 --> 25:31.630
- "How you did that?"

25:31.663 --> 25:33.832
And you say...

25:33.865 --> 25:35.500
- Magic.
- Of course.

25:35.534 --> 25:36.735

25:36.768 --> 25:39.771
Well, Dante,
Penn and Teller look ready

25:39.804 --> 25:41.840
to tell us how they think
you did your magic.

25:41.873 --> 25:44.109
- Okay.
- Boys.

25:44.142 --> 25:45.744
- Well, Dante, you came out

25:45.777 --> 25:47.879
and gave us a--
made us a promise

25:47.913 --> 25:49.114
that you were gonna
show us something

25:49.147 --> 25:50.448
we'd never seen before,

25:50.482 --> 25:52.851
and you absolutely did that.

25:52.884 --> 25:53.852

- Thank you.

25:55.587 --> 25:57.389
[cheers and applause]

25:57.422 --> 26:00.492
- What I really loved about it
is how you

26:00.525 --> 26:03.228
actually give away
a lot of magic secrets

26:03.261 --> 26:04.663
as you go through it.

26:04.696 --> 26:06.431
You give a lecture

26:06.464 --> 26:08.800
on how to do this basic trick.

26:08.833 --> 26:11.002
Most important,
you teach them during that,

26:11.036 --> 26:13.104
that you're using
all normal cards,

26:13.138 --> 26:14.272
'cause this is the way
you handle them.

26:14.306 --> 26:15.507
This is the way you do it.

26:15.540 --> 26:17.676
But I keep coming back
to the fact

26:17.709 --> 26:19.277
that you said
you'd show us something

26:19.311 --> 26:20.645
we'd never seen before.

26:20.679 --> 26:24.616
And I think--
and I'm just gonna ask you--

26:24.649 --> 26:26.184
this is really yours, right?

26:26.217 --> 26:27.619
- Yes.
- You invented this?

26:27.652 --> 26:28.887
- Yes.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.989
- That's astonishing.

26:31.022 --> 26:32.857

Thank you very much.

26:39.030 --> 26:41.533
and there's also
craftsmanship on this

26:41.566 --> 26:44.536
that is just beyond
our wildest dreams.

26:44.569 --> 26:46.905
It really is something
we've never seen before.

26:46.938 --> 26:48.173
- Thank you.

26:48.206 --> 26:50.842
- And it really was--
was beautifully done.

26:50.875 --> 26:54.746
And it was so amazing that, um,

26:54.779 --> 26:59.217
although we didn't see anything
directly fishy,

26:59.250 --> 27:02.754
there's only one way
this could be done.

27:02.787 --> 27:04.856
We think we know what that is,

27:04.889 --> 27:07.192
and we think it's because

27:07.225 --> 27:09.995
the real method on this
is that you're a genius.

27:10.028 --> 27:11.296
- [laughing]

27:11.329 --> 27:12.964
- You did an amazing job...

27:12.998 --> 27:14.099
- Thank you very much.

27:14.132 --> 27:16.334
- At showing us something
we'd never seen.

27:16.368 --> 27:18.203
But I don't think
you fooled us.

27:18.236 --> 27:20.271
I think maybe
you know what I mean.

27:20.305 --> 27:22.474
- So, Dante,
does Penn understand

27:22.507 --> 27:23.508
how you did your trick?

27:23.541 --> 27:24.609
- Yes.

27:24.643 --> 27:25.710
He understood
how I did the trick.

27:25.744 --> 27:27.045
- All right.
- Oh, it was so good.

27:27.078 --> 27:29.080
- Thank you.
- Well, thank you so much.

39:02.606 --> 39:04.742
45 years.

39:04.775 --> 39:06.777
And there's
a little bit of rivalry.

39:06.811 --> 39:10.381
When I do something,
Teller wants to do it more.

39:10.414 --> 39:13.451
So Teller's gonna do something
way more illegal.

39:13.484 --> 39:15.119
'Cause he has
something in there

39:15.152 --> 39:17.488
that it's illegal to possess,

39:17.521 --> 39:20.491
and that is treasury paper.

39:20.524 --> 39:23.694
This is the paper
that bills are printed on.

39:23.728 --> 39:26.630
It's made by the Crane Paper
Company in Massachusetts,

39:26.664 --> 39:27.932
and they've been making it

39:27.965 --> 39:30.501
since before there
was a United States.

39:30.534 --> 39:32.870
'Cause they made it
during the Revolutionary War.

39:32.903 --> 39:33.938
Now, if you examine that,
you'll see

39:33.971 --> 39:35.740
it does not feel
like regular paper.

39:35.773 --> 39:37.341
It feels like a bill

39:37.375 --> 39:40.244
because it is 75% cotton,
25% linen.

39:40.277 --> 39:41.679
It's called rag paper.

39:41.712 --> 39:42.947
Now, I don't know
how good your eyes are,

39:42.980 --> 39:44.014
but hold it up to the light.

39:44.048 --> 39:45.282
I can't see this.
Maybe you can.

39:45.316 --> 39:48.586
You'll be able to see
little tiny, tiny threads

39:48.619 --> 39:51.922
of red, blue, and metallic.

39:51.956 --> 39:53.057
You see that there?

39:53.090 --> 39:54.258
That makes it harder
to counterfeit.

39:54.291 --> 39:57.261
Now, possessing that
is illegal.

39:57.294 --> 39:59.263
But Teller's gonna go
a step further.

39:59.296 --> 40:02.466
I destroyed a dollar bill
in a felony.

40:02.500 --> 40:03.634
But Teller's gonna risk

40:03.667 --> 40:06.570
a $250,000 fine

40:06.604 --> 40:08.406
and 20 years in prison

40:08.439 --> 40:10.641
to do something really stupid.

40:10.674 --> 40:12.143
He is counterfeiting

40:12.176 --> 40:15.112
a $1 bill, Christian.

40:15.146 --> 40:16.914
[laughter]
A $1 bill.

40:16.947 --> 40:19.483
And not even
the complete $1 bill.

40:19.517 --> 40:21.585
There's one part
he didn't bother with.

40:21.619 --> 40:24.922
That part right there that's
kind of vaguely shaped.

40:24.955 --> 40:27.091
Like what you have there,
Christian.

40:27.124 --> 40:29.794
You have your serial number
right there.

40:29.827 --> 40:32.630
Now, we've gonna check this.
There's a serial number.

40:32.663 --> 40:34.999
We're gonna see if it matches
the serial number on this bill.

40:35.032 --> 40:38.269
So very loudly, Christian, read
out the serial number, please.

40:38.302 --> 40:44.108
- L-0-9-1-7-2-3-2-8-R.

40:44.141 --> 40:45.810
- Yes!
Perfect!

40:45.843 --> 40:47.278
[cheers and applause]

40:47.311 --> 40:49.847
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

40:49.880 --> 40:51.282
After all these years,

40:51.315 --> 40:53.017
all these years
of Penn and Teller,

40:53.050 --> 40:54.385
you think we bluff?

40:54.985 --> 40:56.487
You think we bluff?

40:56.520 --> 40:57.955
There's the serial number
right there.

40:57.988 --> 40:59.023
Now, there's your piece.

40:59.056 --> 41:00.458
Now, yours looks like

41:00.491 --> 41:02.593
you've been carrying it around
in the bottom of your shoe.

41:02.626 --> 41:04.028
This one's brand new.

41:04.061 --> 41:05.763
This one's old and disgusting.

41:05.796 --> 41:06.831
But you watch.

41:06.864 --> 41:08.265
Look at the serial numbers.

41:08.299 --> 41:09.800
The serial numbers match.

41:09.834 --> 41:11.101
But more important than that,

41:11.135 --> 41:14.038
watch good ole George's face

41:14.071 --> 41:17.475
go right back together
perfectly.

41:17.508 --> 41:20.911
That matches exactly
right there.

41:20.945 --> 41:22.713
[cheers and applause]
And the serial numbers.

41:22.746 --> 41:23.848
Teller, nice job.

41:23.881 --> 41:25.983
Christian, you can keep this.

41:26.016 --> 41:27.518
But promise me

41:27.551 --> 41:30.254
you'll destroy it
before you leave the casino

41:30.287 --> 41:32.389
'cause possessing
counterfeit money,

41:32.423 --> 41:33.824
that's a felony, Christian.

41:33.858 --> 41:34.859
That's a felony.

41:34.892 --> 41:36.293
[laughter]
That's a felony.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.295
[cheers and applause]

41:38.329 --> 41:39.997
- Ahh.

41:40.030 --> 41:41.565
- What do you wanna do illegal?

41:41.599 --> 41:43.834
- Wow.

41:43.868 --> 41:45.936
Teller just committed a crime,

41:45.970 --> 41:48.439
so we gotta go
before the FBI gets here.

41:48.472 --> 41:51.208
We'll be back next week
when the heat blows off.

41:51.242 --> 41:52.776
See you soon.

41:52.810 --> 41:56.213
[cheers and applause]
