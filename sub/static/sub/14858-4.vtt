20:07.540 --> 20:09.907
Impressive moves back there
with those hipsters.

Maybe we'd do okay
in a zombie apocalypse.

we'd be unstoppable.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.163

Slow down.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.227
Ah! I pulled my hamstring,
Dave.

20:33.274 --> 20:35.481
Dave, I pulled my hammy out.
Slow down.

20:35.776 --> 20:38.768
| pulled my other hamstring.
| pulled my other hamstring!

20:39.071 --> 20:41.938
Dave!

This is not something
friends do.

20:44.034 --> 20:45.024
| have a cramp.
