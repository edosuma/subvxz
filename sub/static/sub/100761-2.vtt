WEBVTT

00:08.007 --> 00:09.218
I'm cold.

00:09.927 --> 00:11.178
How long now?

00:13.472 --> 00:14.723
Shouldn't be too long.

00:18.602 --> 00:19.686
Hello.

00:42.125 --> 00:45.254
Right, we should put my family down
as references 'cause your family hate me.

00:45.337 --> 00:47.422
That's not true-- entirely.

00:47.506 --> 00:49.424
I don't even really want to put mine down,
to be honest.

00:49.508 --> 00:52.678
-Who do you want to put then?
-People who don't know us as well.

00:53.971 --> 00:56.890
I thought this was just supposed to be
an initial registration form.

00:56.974 --> 00:58.934
Yeah, but there's space
for additional info,

00:59.017 --> 01:00.853
-so I thought I'd just really sell us.
-Oh, yeah?

01:00.936 --> 01:02.980
Well, everyone exaggerates.
It's like a CV.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.816
"I have a keen interest
in the economics of green energy."

01:05.899 --> 01:08.360
-What? I do.
-Really?

01:08.443 --> 01:11.572
-Yeah. I read a book about it.
-Which one? Which one was it?

01:12.447 --> 01:14.199
-Okay, an article.
-Right.

01:14.283 --> 01:17.369
-All right, fine, a tweet.
-"I'm a proficient cellist..."

01:17.452 --> 01:19.538
They're not gonna have a cello
in their office to check, are they?

01:19.621 --> 01:22.207
"...and have played volleyball
to a county standard."

01:22.291 --> 01:24.459
-Oh, God. Oh, God.
-What?

01:24.543 --> 01:25.794
We have to list past relationships.

01:25.878 --> 01:27.337
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:27.421 --> 01:30.299
-Why?
-Dunno. Suppose they just have to check.

01:30.382 --> 01:33.051
-What are they checking for?
-Dunno, just check.

01:33.135 --> 01:34.928
-They're being thorough.
-Seems a bit excessive, don't it?

01:35.012 --> 01:37.055
Yeah, but the exes know secrets,
don't they?

01:37.931 --> 01:38.932
Yep.

01:47.691 --> 01:49.484
If you wanna flick
to the back of your books,

01:49.568 --> 01:52.404
you'll find a good list
of irregular verbs.

01:52.487 --> 01:53.572
All right?

02:05.334 --> 02:06.919
Okay, what have you got?

02:09.338 --> 02:11.715
-Thanks for the class.
-No worries. Yeah.

02:11.798 --> 02:14.676
-I enjoy it.
-"Enjoyed." "I enjoyed it."

02:14.760 --> 02:17.095
I mean, we literally just did
half an hour on that.

02:17.179 --> 02:18.639
-I got it.
-Yeah.

02:18.722 --> 02:21.141
-So I enjoyed it.
-You enjoyed it. Good.

02:21.225 --> 02:23.185
-Yeah. See you.
-All right, have a good one.

02:37.199 --> 02:39.243
Did I tell you I found her
having lunch in the greenhouse?

02:39.326 --> 02:40.327
Why?

02:40.869 --> 02:43.914
She said it was warm.
Made her feel like she was on holiday.

02:45.541 --> 02:47.376
You don't think
she's getting Alzheimer's, do you?

02:47.459 --> 02:50.379
No, Karen,
I think she's always been like that.

02:50.462 --> 02:51.505
Good.

02:52.464 --> 02:55.717
Don't know what I'd talk to Dad about
for the next 20 years.

02:59.972 --> 03:01.515
How's Scott?

03:01.598 --> 03:02.766
Fine.

03:03.559 --> 03:05.519
Has he got a job at all or...

03:06.270 --> 03:09.398
Well, it's 11:30,
and he's called me five times now.

03:10.482 --> 03:12.025
On the plus side,

03:12.109 --> 03:14.403
I haven't missed a parcel delivery
in months.

03:15.487 --> 03:17.573
Did you tell him
about the vacancy at my place?

03:17.656 --> 03:18.699
Yeah.

03:18.782 --> 03:23.245
He didn't want to work in a call center.
He says he hasn't completely given up.

03:24.997 --> 03:27.082
Okay. Right.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.127
Well, who's paying the rent then?

03:30.544 --> 03:32.713
-It's just temporary.
-Okay.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.548
Okay.

03:36.091 --> 03:39.052
Just as long as you feel empowered
as a person.

03:39.136 --> 03:41.597
You know, just be able to voice your needs
as well as thinking about--

03:41.680 --> 03:42.723
Okay. No, no, no.

03:42.806 --> 03:46.059
You're talking like an American again.
You know I hate it when you do that.

03:49.146 --> 03:52.024
-Don't mention anything when you see him.
-No, I won't.

03:56.278 --> 03:58.322
He says he's invented
a new type of cereal.

03:58.405 --> 04:02.326
So, you know,
maybe something will come of that.

04:03.327 --> 04:05.662
-Yeah.
-Hey, move over.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.040
Karen, why do you always have to walk
on the water side?

04:08.123 --> 04:09.708
Because I'm the oldest.

04:13.420 --> 04:16.339
I didn't tell you: Scott's coming tonight.

04:16.423 --> 04:19.259
Why can't my sister attract nice men?

04:19.343 --> 04:21.762
She's nice and clever.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.764
She's cleverer than me, and I have you.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.475
You listening?

04:26.558 --> 04:27.643
Yeah. What's tonight?

04:28.393 --> 04:30.604
Dinner. Karen. You're coming.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.981
No, do not bail on me.
I'm not dealing with him on my own.

04:33.065 --> 04:34.942
-He's all right.
-He is not all right.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.237
He's a snob who thinks
he's better than we are.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.030
He doesn't even have a TV.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.574
And he's so proud of that,
as if it's an achievement.

04:42.658 --> 04:45.911
He's a pretentious prick
in a polo neck. It--

04:45.994 --> 04:48.247
-Are you listening?
-Yeah.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.917
Bet he owns a bloody record player.

04:53.710 --> 04:54.920
Yeah, well.

04:57.172 --> 04:59.675
-No, we're gonna pay with cash.
-Why?

05:00.259 --> 05:03.637
They can check our bank accounts.
They can see everything we do.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.264
-Who can?
-Adoption people.

05:06.181 --> 05:08.559
Things like alcohol, cigarettes,
we pay cash. No paper trail.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.769
Bloody hell. Should we get
some burner phones as well?

05:10.853 --> 05:12.312
-Do you have any ID?
-Yeah.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.731
Tell me, you're being serious, yeah?

05:15.148 --> 05:16.984
Well, you need ID for alcohol.

05:17.526 --> 05:18.861
Look at my face.

05:18.944 --> 05:20.404
No, I'm sorry, I need proof.

05:21.446 --> 05:22.906
My face is proof.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.033
Here.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.535
Thank you.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.287
What's the matter with you today?

05:38.547 --> 05:40.799
We need stuff that makes us look good.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.135
We should donate to a charity.

05:43.218 --> 05:45.345
-Then we can say we've donated to charity.
-Which one?

05:45.429 --> 05:47.306
Maybe a children's one?

05:47.931 --> 05:49.766
-Or is that a bit too obvious? Yeah.
-Bit obvious.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.268
-What about animals?
-Oh, God, no.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.729
Only awful people
donate to animal charities.

05:53.812 --> 05:55.647
-Help the Aged?
-Yeah, I like that.

05:55.731 --> 05:58.358
That says we're good people
but not in a "look at me" kind of way.

05:58.442 --> 05:59.526
I'll do it now.

05:59.610 --> 06:02.029
No, but don't give too much
that it makes them suspicious.

06:02.112 --> 06:04.615
Like we've been bad to an old person,
and now we feel guilty.

06:04.698 --> 06:05.908
We should join the National Trust.

06:05.991 --> 06:09.203
That suggests an air
of calmness and dependability.

06:09.286 --> 06:11.246
-Yeah. I like that.
-Yeah.

06:11.997 --> 06:14.666
We're now fully catfishing
social services.

06:14.750 --> 06:18.128
No, we shouldn't think of this form
as a record of who we are,

06:18.212 --> 06:19.963
but a picture of who we're gonna be.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.841
This is an aspirational form.

06:22.925 --> 06:24.843
-Very aspirational.
-It's fine.

06:24.927 --> 06:27.679
As long as we're these people
by the time they meet us, it's all good.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.851
We should make a list of all the flaws
that we want to iron out.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.855
Honestly, Jase, I am so impressed with us.

06:36.939 --> 06:39.399
I think we're gonna be amazing parents.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.280
Okay, this is good.

06:45.364 --> 06:47.658
-I'm feeling positive.
-Absolutely. Yeah.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.118
-You drink too much.
-What? That's--

06:51.036 --> 06:52.371
You think I've got a problem?

06:52.454 --> 06:54.873
It takes me two trips
to take the recycling out.

06:55.374 --> 06:56.959
Every parent I know drinks a lot.

06:57.042 --> 06:59.169
Maybe when we get the kid,
get back on the drink.

06:59.253 --> 07:02.005
But perhaps while we're being assessed,
just lay off it a little.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.924
-Yeah? All right.
-Okay.

07:06.552 --> 07:10.973
"Sometimes occasionally

07:11.056 --> 07:17.688
drinks a bit too much?"

07:18.397 --> 07:19.398
-Okay?
-Yeah.

07:19.481 --> 07:21.900
Well, you should stop smoking.

07:22.693 --> 07:24.528
There'll be a medical,
and, you know, you're older.

07:24.611 --> 07:27.281
-I'm three years older than you.
-You should know better, then,

07:27.364 --> 07:29.032
-shouldn't you?
-All right, fine. I'll stop.

07:29.116 --> 07:29.950
-Really?
-Yeah.

07:30.033 --> 07:32.244
It's not something I'm addicted to.
It's just something I do.

07:32.327 --> 07:33.537
Yeah, okay.

07:35.163 --> 07:39.209
Also, I think that you need
to work on your anger.

07:39.668 --> 07:40.669
My anger?

07:42.462 --> 07:44.131
My anger's fine, maybe.

07:44.214 --> 07:46.258
Okay. "Look at my face. My face is proof."

07:46.341 --> 07:48.343
-That was nothing.
-Yeah, to you, Jase.

07:48.427 --> 07:49.970
You've got an angry energy.

07:50.053 --> 07:51.597
What are you talking about,
"angry energy"?

07:54.057 --> 07:57.561
-Fine, put it down. Yeah.
-"Angry energy."

07:59.104 --> 08:00.814
Okay, what else?

08:04.026 --> 08:05.485
-No, go on.
-Nah, nothing.

08:05.569 --> 08:08.322
-It's all right. You can say.
-Okay.

08:09.823 --> 08:10.824
All right.

08:11.783 --> 08:14.328
Now, I want you to breathe.

08:16.622 --> 08:19.249
I think that you need
to get stronger emotionally.

08:21.460 --> 08:22.294
What?

08:23.795 --> 08:27.049
-See?
-I am strong. I am really strong.

08:27.132 --> 08:29.009
The last year's taken its toll, hasn't it?

08:29.092 --> 08:31.553
I just think you need to build up
a little bit more resilience.

08:31.637 --> 08:33.597
-That's all I'm saying.
-You don't think I'm resilient?

08:33.679 --> 08:36.225
Last week, you cried because you saw
a duck on its own in a pond.

08:36.308 --> 08:38.018
Yeah, because I'm a human with a heart.

08:38.101 --> 08:40.102
Just a little bit stronger,
that's all I'm saying.

08:40.187 --> 08:43.023
-I don't want to turn into a sociopath.
-A little more resilient.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.776
Yeah? Kids can put a lot of pressure
on people, can't they?

08:47.361 --> 08:49.029
Okay, well, that is true.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.699
-You know, I was talking to Erica.
-Yeah?

08:52.783 --> 08:58.372
And she told me that her and Freddy,
they haven't had sex for six months.

08:59.331 --> 09:00.541
-Really?
-Yeah.

09:00.624 --> 09:01.792
-She said it's just gone cold.
-God.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.335
I think he was freaked out
by the pregnancy.

09:03.418 --> 09:04.670
-Shit.
-Hayley and Dan are the same.

09:04.753 --> 09:05.754
-No.
-Yeah.

09:05.838 --> 09:07.673
Christ, six months.

09:08.632 --> 09:09.842
Six.

09:10.467 --> 09:14.304
-Do you wanna know something really awful?
-What? Go on.

09:16.431 --> 09:19.518
I think our friends' marriage problems
makes me horny.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.730
-That's bad, isn't it?
-I mean, it's niche, yeah.

09:51.258 --> 09:55.679
Well done. All right then.
Let's get this in the postbox, shall we?

09:55.762 --> 09:58.223
-No, wait, wait, wait, wait.
-Wait for what? What now?

10:00.225 --> 10:02.895
Right, if you apply it directly,
it's too much.

10:02.978 --> 10:04.271
-So you spray...
-Yeah?

10:05.397 --> 10:06.607
delay...

10:08.192 --> 10:09.568
and walk away.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.112
-Come on!
-Aye.

10:13.405 --> 10:16.408
Okay. Ready?

10:16.491 --> 10:19.119
-Let it go.
-No, you let it go. There.

10:48.398 --> 10:51.818
Being unemployed has just been
incredibly freeing, you know?

10:51.902 --> 10:58.575
I have so much more energy now
for life, philosophy, art, museums.

10:58.951 --> 11:01.995
We're going to a great
multimedia exhibition if you want to come.

11:02.079 --> 11:04.122
No. I never really understand that stuff.

11:04.206 --> 11:08.043
It's not about understanding, is it?
It's about how it makes you feel.

11:08.126 --> 11:09.920
It makes me feel stupid.

11:10.003 --> 11:13.173
No, don't say-- don't--
I hate it when people say that.

11:14.007 --> 11:20.180
You can't survive culturally
on Britain's Got Talent and Love Island.

11:20.264 --> 11:22.349
You should come
to one of my dinner parties.

11:22.975 --> 11:26.061
I style them as a sort of
modern-day salon littéraire.

11:26.144 --> 11:27.521
Oh, God.

11:29.481 --> 11:32.067
Yeah. Yeah, great, yeah.

11:38.282 --> 11:41.201
All right, so, dinner parties:

11:41.285 --> 11:43.787
Anyone living or dead,
who would you have?

11:43.871 --> 11:46.206
Probably my father.

11:47.416 --> 11:49.376
There were a lot of things left unsaid.

11:51.170 --> 11:52.171
Right.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.509
So, where's Jason?

11:57.593 --> 12:01.680
Yeah, sorry. He had to take a class.
He only told me last minute.

12:01.763 --> 12:02.764
Yeah.

12:17.738 --> 12:18.572
Hi.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.080
Couldn't have thought of somewhere new
for us to meet?

12:27.164 --> 12:28.290
Evidently, no.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.462
So, why am I here?

12:35.797 --> 12:38.884
Then one of my year ten netball girls
throws a ball at my head.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.803
Cut my lip open.
Tells me I'm a shit coach.

12:41.887 --> 12:44.681
I said, "Well, you hit me,
so I must be doing something right."

12:45.224 --> 12:46.475
Karen.

12:46.558 --> 12:49.394
I don't know how you both do it, you know?

12:49.478 --> 12:52.231
Every day, eight hours, week after week.

12:53.357 --> 12:55.275
How is the job search going?

12:57.236 --> 13:01.615
Yeah, nothing really feels quite right
at the moment, you know?

13:01.698 --> 13:03.825
I'm really about life balance, and, um...

13:04.993 --> 13:09.456
I don't know, juggling work
and a social life, it's-- well, it's hard.

13:09.540 --> 13:11.750
His friend said
he could get him in at his bank.

13:11.834 --> 13:15.295
City, not High Street.
He went and talked to them.

13:15.379 --> 13:18.465
Yeah, I wanted to see if I could
really care about money,

13:18.549 --> 13:20.175
like, on a fundamental level?

13:20.259 --> 13:23.178
But, you know, turns out I just can't.

13:24.179 --> 13:26.056
Right, and then the hospital thing,
that wasn't--

13:26.139 --> 13:29.434
I feel like hospital administration
is maybe a bit of a bubble.

13:30.018 --> 13:34.773
For me, it's really just about
finding something meaningful in my life.

13:34.857 --> 13:37.025
Well, she teaches children to read.

13:37.109 --> 13:40.153
She does, yeah.
But I mean, like, on a more macro level.

13:42.114 --> 13:44.366
It's nice that you have a girlfriend
who will support you

13:44.449 --> 13:45.534
while you figure stuff out.

13:45.617 --> 13:46.827
Yeah, well...

13:48.120 --> 13:51.957
I think if she forced me to do something
that I didn't really love, I would just...

13:53.125 --> 13:54.960
end up resenting her for it.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.422
-So, shall we order?
-Yeah.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.257
Yeah. Don't worry, I know this place.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.551
¡Chica! Yeah, you.

14:03.552 --> 14:04.970
You know this is tapas.

14:05.053 --> 14:07.055
They spit in your food,
they spit in all our food.

14:11.727 --> 14:13.353
Okay. So...

14:15.063 --> 14:17.774
Right. We're adopting.

14:17.858 --> 14:20.194
Well, we're trying to adopt.

14:21.612 --> 14:27.784
And later on, we're gonna need
references from ex-partners.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.244
-Wow.
-Yeah.

14:29.328 --> 14:31.580
And they're gonna be quite thorough.

14:31.663 --> 14:36.627
And if you put a foot wrong,
then they can reject you, so...

14:37.628 --> 14:39.505
And you're worried that I hate you

14:39.588 --> 14:42.799
-and will ruin your life.
-Basically, yeah. Yeah.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.676
Yeah.

14:45.135 --> 14:47.888
Okay, well, I'll talk to them, yeah.

14:47.971 --> 14:49.097
Okay, great.

14:49.890 --> 14:52.518
-Yeah.
-Great. Amazing.

14:52.601 --> 14:54.728
I can tell them about
your toxic masculinity

14:54.811 --> 14:56.396
and how unavailable you were emotionally.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.899
I'm not sure it's fair to criticize me
with phrases that didn't exist

14:58.982 --> 15:00.150
when we were going out, but--

15:00.234 --> 15:06.782
You'd rather I say you're dependable,
reliable, like an all-round great guy?

15:06.865 --> 15:10.702
-Right, ideally, yes.
-Okay, sure.

15:11.828 --> 15:12.829
All right.

15:14.498 --> 15:16.792
-So, you want me to lie?
-No, I'm not asking you to lie.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.836
-No, no one's lying.
-No one's lying? Really?

15:18.919 --> 15:20.170
No.

15:20.254 --> 15:22.130
You're gonna tell them
how you two got together?

15:23.549 --> 15:26.260
-I know I could have handled it better.
-Does she know?

15:26.343 --> 15:29.263
Yeah, she knows that there
was a bit of an overlap.

15:29.346 --> 15:31.515
-Yeah.
-Shall we start calling it an affair?

15:31.598 --> 15:34.601
A bit young for that, weren't we?
I mean, it was--

15:34.685 --> 15:36.645
Adults have affairs.
It was a ten-day overlap.

15:36.728 --> 15:37.938
It was a ten-day affair.

15:38.981 --> 15:42.568
I suppose I just thought it was over
a long time before it was over.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.319
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Come on.

15:44.403 --> 15:47.030
It was a six-month relationship
which lasted for three years

15:47.114 --> 15:49.783
because neither of us
had the guts to end it, all right?

15:49.867 --> 15:51.368
You checked out way before I met Nikki.

15:51.451 --> 15:54.872
I checked out to protect myself,
because I knew you'd screw me over.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.665
Well, that was never my intention.

15:56.748 --> 15:58.000
Well, that's what happened.

15:59.751 --> 16:00.836
Look.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.089
I've changed, all right?

16:09.595 --> 16:12.973
No, no. You haven't changed. No.

16:13.056 --> 16:15.017
You're gonna mess this one up
like you always do.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.561
You can't smoke in here.
It's not 2006.

16:25.819 --> 16:26.820
What?

16:30.490 --> 16:32.284
Bloody hell, she's doing it.

16:34.786 --> 16:37.623
Peppers.
Peppers here are sensational.

16:38.916 --> 16:42.336
I mean, you wouldn't feed them
to your dog in Barcelona, but for here--

16:42.628 --> 16:43.962
Muchas gracias.

16:44.463 --> 16:46.590
Oh, God. Can't eat all of those.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.717
-Well, I'll have yours.
-No, it's okay, I will.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.678
I'm a woman.
I just have to say that when food arrives.

16:51.762 --> 16:53.138
She's funny.

16:54.139 --> 16:57.893
And funny women, they're--
they're hard to find.

16:59.770 --> 17:00.604
Right.

17:01.480 --> 17:02.481
Toilet.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.406
God, I'm starving.

17:14.826 --> 17:16.869
Sorry, Karen.
Just give me two seconds.

17:26.630 --> 17:31.218
Okay, I just wanna say,
I think you've been pretty rude tonight.

17:31.301 --> 17:35.305
I know you know lots of things about lots
of things, but politeness costs nothing.

17:36.014 --> 17:37.307
Which is actually lucky for you,

17:37.391 --> 17:39.977
because you haven't had a job
in, like, six months.

17:40.060 --> 17:43.355
So maybe just have
a little think about that,

17:43.438 --> 17:46.483
and start treating my sister
with a bit more respect.

17:49.903 --> 17:52.990
And by the way,
you can't juggle work and a social life.

17:53.073 --> 17:56.702
That's two things.
That's the same number of things as hands.

17:56.785 --> 18:00.372
That's not juggling,
that's just holding things in your hands.

18:08.422 --> 18:09.965
-Enjoy. Have a nice night.
-Same to you.

18:25.230 --> 18:26.857
You never answered my texts.

18:26.940 --> 18:29.776
Well, there was a lot of them.
They were all in capitals.

18:29.860 --> 18:31.445
Yeah, well, I was angry.

18:31.528 --> 18:34.239
-You were always angry.
-I wonder why?

18:34.323 --> 18:35.699
It was all my fault, yeah.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.869
Well, I'm not angry at other people.

18:39.828 --> 18:41.997
I'm sorry.
You have to go outside to do that.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.208
-I am outside.
-You're inside.

18:44.291 --> 18:47.002
-Yeah, but my mouth is outside.
-A lot of the smoke's coming--

18:47.085 --> 18:50.422
You know what? I really feel like
this is a gray area, so...

19:07.689 --> 19:11.568
-Right, then. See you soon.
-Okay.

19:12.152 --> 19:13.570
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

19:13.654 --> 19:14.947
So, when are you gonna hear back?

19:15.030 --> 19:17.449
We literally just posted it,
so I don't know.

19:18.534 --> 19:19.618
They're gonna love you.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.079
You're brilliant.

19:23.205 --> 19:25.832
-Karen, that's so--
-Okay, I'll see you then.

19:25.916 --> 19:26.959
Okay.

19:27.709 --> 19:31.380
-Bye.
-Oh, God. A baby. All right.

19:33.507 --> 19:34.508
Yeah.

19:35.467 --> 19:36.885
I am brilliant.

19:50.315 --> 19:54.319
So, the Internet says that you're
in a relationship. Is that right?

19:54.403 --> 19:57.072
Yeah, you know,
I should update that, 'cause...

19:59.241 --> 20:00.659
He put a ring on it?

20:00.742 --> 20:02.494
-Yeah.
-Wow.

20:02.786 --> 20:06.832
Well, that's lovely.
That's really lovely. Lovely.

20:06.915 --> 20:08.876
What are you doing now?

20:08.959 --> 20:11.086
-Still teaching English.
-At the language school?

20:11.170 --> 20:12.588
Yeah. Yeah.

20:12.671 --> 20:15.007
Wow. How long is this gap year
gonna last, Jason?

20:15.883 --> 20:18.260
Does that make enough money,
though, for kids?

20:18.343 --> 20:20.220
You know, we'll never be rich, but--

20:20.304 --> 20:22.639
Yeah, well, growing up rich ruins you.

20:22.723 --> 20:24.099
All the men cry after sex

20:24.183 --> 20:26.185
and all the women
have eating disorders, so...

20:28.478 --> 20:30.480
It's really nice to see you again, Jane.

20:31.315 --> 20:32.649
Yeah, you too.

20:32.733 --> 20:34.526
And I really have changed,
you know, honestly.

20:34.610 --> 20:37.362
In fact, today Nikki and I made a list

20:37.446 --> 20:39.448
of all the ways in which
we can improve ourselves.

20:39.531 --> 20:43.493
And you know you always said
that I should get into mindfulness?

20:43.577 --> 20:46.705
Well, today I downloaded this app--

20:47.873 --> 20:50.751
What? Jane! Where you going?

20:51.460 --> 20:52.461
Jane!

20:55.047 --> 20:56.882
-Jane, wait! What?
-You! You!

20:57.591 --> 20:59.968
You are a real dick.

21:00.511 --> 21:02.554
-You know that?
-What? Why?

21:02.638 --> 21:04.640
Do you know how hard it was
to be with you,

21:04.723 --> 21:07.392
-how impossible you were?
-I know, but I've just told you,

21:07.476 --> 21:10.020
-I'm a different person now.
-Yeah, of course you are.

21:10.103 --> 21:13.398
-That's the worst part.
-I'm sorry. How's that?

21:13.482 --> 21:16.276
You're a better person
because you practiced on me.

21:17.110 --> 21:18.529
Yeah, but that wasn't my intention.

21:18.612 --> 21:20.405
-That's just life, isn't it?
-Oh, great.

21:20.489 --> 21:24.451
Well, I'm glad I was able to sacrifice
myself in the name of your self-discovery.

21:24.535 --> 21:26.537
You know,
I'm glad it wasn't all for nothing.

21:26.620 --> 21:29.039
So, you'd rather I was
the same old idiot I always used to be?

21:29.122 --> 21:30.207
Yes! Yes!

21:30.290 --> 21:32.501
Oh, my God!
That would be so much better.

21:33.585 --> 21:35.671
I know who that person was gonna be.

21:35.754 --> 21:39.049
You know, some sad, old,
secretary-shagging letdown.

21:39.466 --> 21:41.802
That would be fine.
I'd have dodged a bullet.

21:41.885 --> 21:44.805
But this? This is so much worse.

21:45.514 --> 21:46.598
But why?

21:47.850 --> 21:49.434
Because this is what I wanted.

21:51.812 --> 21:54.690
And it turns out
that you wanted what I wanted all along.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.568
Just not with me.

22:06.493 --> 22:09.830
Do you know what
the most annoying thing is?

22:11.290 --> 22:13.500
You've become the person

22:14.334 --> 22:17.796
that you hated me for telling you
you could be.

22:22.176 --> 22:24.469
I mean, what did you even like about me?

22:30.392 --> 22:33.520
-Oh, my God, Jason. Think of one thing.
-I liked your strength.

22:33.604 --> 22:34.688
I liked your...

22:36.023 --> 22:37.024
your spirit.

22:38.358 --> 22:41.153
I liked your faith in people.

22:41.236 --> 22:43.697
I liked your laugh. I liked...

22:44.781 --> 22:47.034
I liked how I could always tell
that you were gonna make a joke

22:47.117 --> 22:48.660
'cause you got
the same little smile on your face.

22:48.744 --> 22:54.541
I liked how "MMMbop" was
the only Hanson song that you didn't like.

22:54.625 --> 22:58.295
I liked how you always said your name
when you answered your phone.

22:58.378 --> 23:00.464
-It's polite.
-It's a mobile.

23:00.547 --> 23:05.552
And I liked how you were genuinely happy
for other people.

23:07.137 --> 23:10.057
I liked lots of things, lots of things.

23:10.140 --> 23:13.060
And I'm really sorry
that you didn't know that.

23:18.023 --> 23:20.025
Didn't even need that much, you know?

23:21.109 --> 23:23.695
Just for you to hold my hand
every now and again.

23:23.779 --> 23:26.740
I know. I know.

23:29.368 --> 23:30.619
I have missed you.

23:32.579 --> 23:33.747
I missed you as well.

23:46.510 --> 23:49.263
You can relax. I'm not gonna ruin
your chance to have a kid.

23:50.264 --> 23:52.057
I think you'd be a good dad.

23:52.140 --> 23:53.684
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

23:55.227 --> 23:57.312
Just, if you have a boy, Jason...

23:58.814 --> 24:01.149
just make sure
he doesn't grow up to be a dick.

24:02.901 --> 24:03.986
Do my best.

24:05.362 --> 24:06.363
Yeah.

24:15.163 --> 24:16.164
Hiya.

24:18.125 --> 24:19.126
Hello.

24:19.751 --> 24:21.420
-All right?
-Yeah.

24:24.548 --> 24:28.177
Now, why do you smell
like booze and cigarettes?

24:29.094 --> 24:32.514
'Cause I met up with my ex,
and we spent the evening together.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.226
You're funny.

24:54.203 --> 24:56.079
-Have you seen the list?
-What list?

24:56.163 --> 24:58.582
The list. You know, the one
with all of our issues on it.

24:58.665 --> 25:00.918
-I don't know.
-I want to pin it to the fridge,

25:01.001 --> 25:02.503
you know, to focus us.

25:02.586 --> 25:03.837
Table, maybe?

25:03.921 --> 25:06.173
No, I've looked on the table.
It's not there.

25:13.514 --> 25:15.849
I mean, yeah,
I definitely put it there.

25:20.521 --> 25:22.064
-You put it there?
-Yeah.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.817
It's just that's where
I picked up the form from.

25:29.154 --> 25:30.614
Did you write the list
on the back of the form?

25:30.697 --> 25:31.698
No.

25:36.495 --> 25:38.372
I mean, yeah.

25:38.455 --> 25:40.123
It was thick. I thought it was--

25:40.207 --> 25:42.626
You know, we've got so much bits of paper
spread around everywhere.

25:42.709 --> 25:44.753
-Oh, my God.
-I like resting on loads of sheets.

25:44.837 --> 25:46.171
It makes my handwriting neater.

25:46.255 --> 25:47.422
-Shit!
-Shit! Shit! Shit!

25:47.506 --> 25:49.258
Why didn't you check
what you were writing on?

25:49.341 --> 25:52.010
I didn't think. Why did you
post a form with writing on the back?

25:52.094 --> 25:54.596
I didn't see it. You distracted me
spraying stuff all over it.

25:54.680 --> 25:58.058
We have sent an adoption agency
a list of all of our character flaws.

25:58.141 --> 25:59.518
It's all right.
We can just deny it was us.

25:59.601 --> 26:02.771
Jason, we literally signed our names
on the bottom of it!

26:09.653 --> 26:10.737
I'm cold.

26:11.530 --> 26:12.698
How long now?

26:14.992 --> 26:16.159
Shouldn't be too long.

26:32.259 --> 26:34.928
Bye. I'm off. Okay.

26:38.682 --> 26:39.683
Oi.

26:49.985 --> 26:51.069
That's it.

26:51.153 --> 26:52.696
Here we go. Up, yeah.

26:53.280 --> 26:54.281
There now.

26:59.036 --> 27:03.457
And all of the others
Cancel out each other

27:03.540 --> 27:06.585
