I HAVE TO GO.

04:20.810 --> 04:22.118
I'M ALWAYS THE COOK.

ARE THE SLIGHTLY ELEVATED
FSH LEVELS.

04:46.700 --> 04:48.588
- WELL,
GIVEN YOUR FSH LEVELS

04:48.630 --> 04:50.245

04:50.290 --> 04:53.418
THAT OCCURS
BETWEEN 34 AND 37,

04:53.460 --> 04:54.939
I SUGGEST YOU THINK ABOUT
MOVING YOUR TIMETABLE UP.

04:54.980 --> 04:57.778

15:03.690 --> 15:05.169
- STINK BUGS.

15:05.210 --> 15:07.724
- GREAT.

15:07.760 --> 15:09.239
WELL, WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE HEAD OUTSIDE

15:09.280 --> 15:10.724
AND TOSS THE BALL

15:10.770 --> 15:12.385

15:12.420 --> 15:15.730
[telephone rings]

15:15.770 --> 15:17.419

15:21.570 --> 15:24.539

15:24.570 --> 15:27.198
YOU LEFT YOUR BASEBALL GEAR

UH, TODAY, I'M FREE.

15:37.660 --> 15:39.685
UH, HEY, MAX,

15:39.730 --> 15:41.174
IT'S DREW.

15:41.210 --> 15:42.939
HE WANTS TO KNOW
IF YOU WANT TO PLAY SOME BALL.

15:42.970 --> 15:45.279
- SURE!

15:45.320 --> 15:47.072
- ALL RIGHT, DREW,
SOUNDS LIKE WE GOT A PLAN.

15:47.110 --> 15:48.862

15:48.910 --> 15:50.070
YEAH, BYE.

GET IT! GET IT!

16:09.030 --> 16:11.476
COME ON, MAX!
ALL RIGHT.

16:11.520 --> 16:13.101
- CAN I GO GET
A DRINK OF WATER?

16:13.140 --> 16:15.244
- YEAH. JUST HUSTLE

16:16.830 --> 16:18.001
ALL RIGHT, DREW,

LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.975
ALL RIGHT, PRETEND
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN, DREW.

16:25.010 --> 16:26.568
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- LOOK AWAY.

16:26.600 --> 16:30.639
PRETEND THAT DIDN'T
HAPPEN, BUDDY.

16:30.670 --> 16:32.058
ALL RIGHT!

16:32.090 --> 16:33.842
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT!
GOOD STOP!

16:33.880 --> 16:35.984
- DID YOU SEE THAT?
- [laughing]

16:36.020 --> 16:37.157
LET'S SEE--ARE YOU READY?

16:37.200 --> 16:38.155
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.599
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

16:39.650 --> 16:40.674
GET UNDER IT!

16:40.720 --> 16:42.608
YEAH! NICE!

16:42.650 --> 16:44.333
COME ON.

16:46.210 --> 16:48.098
- HEY, YOU.
- HEY.

16:48.140 --> 16:50.415
- JUST WONDERING WHY
YOU DIDN'T COME INTO WORK TODAY.

16:50.450 --> 16:53.248
- OH, UH, THEY CANCELED
THE SESSION.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.759
- YEAH, BUT THERE'S
STILL STUFF TO DO,

16:54.800 --> 16:56.665
AND YOU USUALLY
STOP BY, AND...

16:56.700 --> 16:58.349
I WAS JUST
SORT OF NOTICING

16:58.390 --> 16:59.379
THAT MAYBE YOU'VE
BEEN LAYING A LITTLE LOW

16:59.430 --> 17:01.079
SINCE OUR VISIT
WITH DR. GERARD.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.668
- HAVE I?

17:05.160 --> 17:06.673
- BUT HE KIND OF
FREAKED ME OUT, TOO.

17:06.710 --> 17:07.984
- [laughs]

17:08.020 --> 17:09.635
WAS IT THAT HE WANTS
ALL THREE OF US

17:09.680 --> 17:11.261
TO HAVE A KID TOGETHER?

17:11.300 --> 17:14.167
- MM, GOD, I KNOW.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.781
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'VE BEEN THINKING,

17:15.820 --> 17:18.300
AND IT'S NOT LIKE THREE YEARS
IS THAT FAR AWAY.

17:18.340 --> 17:22.618
AND, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE IN A GOOD PLACE, RIGHT?

17:24.760 --> 17:25.931
- YEAH, WE ARE.

17:25.970 --> 17:28.655
- AND I KNOW
THAT'S NOT OUR DEAL,

17:28.700 --> 17:30.144
WHICH I WILL HONOR.

17:30.180 --> 17:34.139
BUT THERE'S REALLY
NOTHING HOLDING US BACK

17:34.190 --> 17:36.829
FROM STARTING RIGHT NOW,
SO IF YOU'RE WILLING,

17:36.880 --> 17:38.563
SO AM I.

17:46.720 --> 17:48.267
- WELL? WHAT DID HE SAY?

17:48.300 --> 17:49.927
WAS HE MAD?
WAS HE UPSET?

17:49.960 --> 17:51.757
WAS HE SAD?

17:51.790 --> 17:55.305
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

17:55.350 --> 17:56.920
- I DIDN'T TELL HIM.

17:56.970 --> 17:58.449
- 'CAUSE HE'S SO COOL,
RIGHT?

17:58.490 --> 17:59.866
- NO, NOT 'CAUSE
HE'S SO COOL.

17:59.900 --> 18:01.037
BECAUSE HE BELIEVES IN YOU,

18:01.080 --> 18:04.766
AND FOR SOME STUPID REASON,
SO DO I.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.529
YOU BETTER NOT LET US DOWN.

18:06.560 --> 18:07.595
- I TOTALLY WON'T.

18:07.630 --> 18:09.734
- YOU OWE ME A PAPER
ON THE SOUND AND THE FURY.

18:09.770 --> 18:10.941
- WAIT.

18:10.980 --> 18:13.733
- AND IT BETTER BE ORIGINAL
AND INSIGHTFUL AND MOVING.

18:13.780 --> 18:16.465
- HEY. HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

18:16.500 --> 18:17.876
I BORROWED DREW
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

18:17.920 --> 18:18.739
- HEY. THAT'S OKAY.

18:18.780 --> 18:19.701
- HEY, DREW,
WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW

18:19.750 --> 18:21.604
AT THE BALLPARK,
A LITTLE BATTING PRACTICE.

18:21.650 --> 18:23.538
- YEP.
- HERE.

18:24.790 --> 18:26.439
- BUT IT'S YOURS.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.754
- WELL,
JUST TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT,

18:27.790 --> 18:29.303
KEEP IT OILED.

18:31.450 --> 18:32.678
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

18:33.900 --> 18:35.629
- BYE, DREW.
- THANKS.

18:35.660 --> 18:37.104
BYE.

18:41.600 --> 18:43.875
- [whispering]
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

18:49.430 --> 18:50.397
- HEY.

18:50.430 --> 18:51.397
- HEY.

18:51.440 --> 18:55.911
- UM, JABBAR IS
ACTUALLY OUT AT A SLEEPOVER

18:55.960 --> 18:56.949
RIGHT NOW.

18:56.990 --> 18:59.811
- WELL, I ACTUALLY
CAME TO TALK TO YOU, SO...

18:59.860 --> 19:00.758
- OH, OKAY.

19:00.790 --> 19:02.166
- UM...

19:03.520 --> 19:05.784
I WANT TO GET
A PATERNITY TEST,

19:05.830 --> 19:07.650
YOU KNOW, FOR JABBAR.

19:07.690 --> 19:08.679
- WHAT?

19:08.730 --> 19:10.311
- WELL, I'M JUST--
I'M TRYING TO MAKE

19:10.350 --> 19:12.318
SOME BIG LIFE DECISIONS,
AND, UH, MY LITTLE SISTER,

19:12.350 --> 19:14.830
WHO ACTS LIKE SHE'S
OLDER THAN ME, BUT ISN'T--

19:14.870 --> 19:16.144
ANYWAY, SHE'S A LAWYER,

19:16.180 --> 19:20.219
AND SHE SAYS THAT
I SHOULD KNOW FOR SURE.

19:21.330 --> 19:22.945
- SO YOU THINK
I'M LYING?

19:22.980 --> 19:24.151
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

19:24.190 --> 19:26.943
I JUST NEED TO KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT MY, UH...

19:26.990 --> 19:27.809
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

19:27.850 --> 19:30.569
EXACTLY WHAT
MY RESPONSIBILITIES ARE,

19:30.610 --> 19:33.306
FINANCIALLY
AND LEGALLY SPEAKING.

19:33.340 --> 19:34.682
- I DIDN'T
INTRODUCE YOU TO HIM

19:34.720 --> 19:36.756
TO TRY AND HIT YOU UP
FOR MONEY

19:36.790 --> 19:39.725
OR TO PULL SOME SCAM
OR WHATEVER IT IS

19:39.760 --> 19:41.512
YOU AND YOUR SISTER
THINK I'M UP TO.

19:41.550 --> 19:44.622
I JUST WANTED MY SON
TO KNOW HIS FATHER. THAT'S ALL.

19:44.660 --> 19:47.072
- YEAH, I DON'T--
LISTEN, UM...

19:47.110 --> 19:48.862
THIS WAS A MISTAKE.

19:48.910 --> 19:50.047
- YEAH, IT WAS.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.219
- CAN WE JUST REWIND AND FORGET
ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION?

19:52.260 --> 19:54.399
- ACTUALLY,
YOU JUST NEED TO GO, OKAY?

19:54.430 --> 19:55.590
- ALL RIGHT.
BUT, LOOK,

19:55.640 --> 19:56.948
HEY, WAIT.
JABBAR AND I--

19:56.980 --> 20:00.154
ARE JABBAR AND I STILL ON
FOR THE ZOO TOMORROW?

20:00.190 --> 20:02.750
- I DON'T THINK SO.

20:02.780 --> 20:03.747
- YOU DON'T THINK SO?

20:03.780 --> 20:04.769
[door slams]

20:04.820 --> 20:05.889
ALL RIGHT, THAT WAS...

20:05.920 --> 20:07.569
THAT WAS GREAT.

20:15.690 --> 20:18.250
Haddie:
[speaking indistinctly]

20:20.110 --> 20:23.284
[giggling]

20:24.050 --> 20:26.075
I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S SO RANDOM.

20:26.120 --> 20:27.872
- HEY, HADDIE.
- MOM?

20:29.050 --> 20:30.972
- WHOA! KRISTINA,
LOOKIN' GOOD.

20:31.020 --> 20:33.397
- HEY, STEVE.

20:33.430 --> 20:34.294
UM, YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:34.330 --> 20:35.911
HADDIE HAS TO LOG OFF
THE COMPUTER.

20:35.950 --> 20:37.531
- OH, YEAH. NO PROBLEMO.

20:37.580 --> 20:38.399
UH, TTYL.

20:38.440 --> 20:40.408
[slams screen]

20:40.440 --> 20:42.169
- YOU KNOW THE RULE.
NO COMPUTER AFTER 10:00.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.339
- NO, ACTUALLY,
YOU GUYS SAID THE PHONE.

20:44.380 --> 20:45.824
I DON'T THINK
THAT THE BRAVERMAN TALIBAN

20:45.860 --> 20:47.919
HAS OUTLAWED THE COMPUTER.

20:47.970 --> 20:48.789
- OKAY, WHATEVER.

20:48.830 --> 20:50.616
YOU BROKE THE SPIRIT
OF THE RULE,

20:50.660 --> 20:52.582
OF THE PHONE,
WITH THE COMPUTER.

20:52.630 --> 20:53.790
- WHATEVER.

20:53.830 --> 20:56.071
- HADDIE, DO NOT WALK
AWAY FROM ME

20:56.110 --> 20:57.099
WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU.

20:57.150 --> 20:58.071
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:58.110 --> 20:59.623
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE YOU GUYS COULD LEARN

20:59.670 --> 21:01.422
A FEW PARENTING TIPS
FROM STEVE'S PARENTS.

21:01.460 --> 21:02.666
RULE NUMBER ONE BEING

21:02.700 --> 21:05.157
GIVE YOUR KIDS
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF PRIVACY.

21:05.190 --> 21:06.919
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
HADDIE?

21:06.950 --> 21:08.429
[door closes]

21:08.470 --> 21:10.085
- YOU ALL RIGHT?
- NO, I'M NOT.

21:10.130 --> 21:11.392
I HATE STEVE'S PARENTS.

21:11.440 --> 21:12.771
I HATE THEM.

21:15.790 --> 21:16.540
- YEAH. ME, TOO.

21:16.580 --> 21:17.922
- HEY, DID YOU TALK
TO JASMINE

21:17.960 --> 21:19.404
ABOUT THE PATERNITY TEST?

21:19.450 --> 21:21.714
- HEY. YEAH, I DID,
AND, MAN, IT WENT GREAT.

21:21.760 --> 21:22.897
- GOOD.

21:22.930 --> 21:24.204
YOU WANT ME TO SET UP
AN APPOINTMENT

21:24.240 --> 21:25.514
WITH MY GUY
FOR YOU AND JABBAR?

21:25.560 --> 21:27.312
- OH, NO, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GO TO ALL THAT TROUBLE,

21:27.350 --> 21:28.556
BECAUSE THANKS TO YOU

21:28.590 --> 21:29.488
TELLING ME
HOW TO LIVE MY LIFE,

21:29.520 --> 21:31.624
JASMINE NOW THINKS
I'M A GIANT JACKASS

21:31.660 --> 21:33.457
AND DOESN'T WANT ME
ANYWHERE NEAR JABBAR.

21:33.490 --> 21:35.424
OH, AND KATIE'S GOING
OFF THE PILL TOMORROW, TOO,

21:35.460 --> 21:36.631
SO THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

21:36.670 --> 21:37.489
- WOW.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.805
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
HOW ALL OF THAT

21:39.850 --> 21:40.942
IS EXACTLY MY FAULT,

21:40.980 --> 21:42.117
BUT DON'T YOU THINK
THAT THAT'S SUSPICIOUS

21:42.160 --> 21:45.152
THAT JASMINE FREAKED OUT
WHEN YOU BROUGHT UP THE TEST?

21:45.200 --> 21:46.394
- YEAH,
OR MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE

21:46.440 --> 21:47.771
I BASICALLY
CALLED HER A LIAR.

21:47.820 --> 21:49.401
- YOU JUST
WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

21:49.440 --> 21:51.021
- YEAH, AND SHE SAID
I WAS THE FATHER.

21:51.060 --> 21:53.688
- AND THEN REFUSED TO LET YOU
CORROBORATE THAT.

21:53.720 --> 21:54.618
- "CORROBORATE"?

21:54.650 --> 21:56.231
DID YOU JUST REALLY
USE THAT WORD

21:56.280 --> 21:57.474
IN A NORMAL CONVERSATION?

21:59.310 --> 22:00.891
THAT HAS JABBAR'S DNA
ON IT.

22:00.940 --> 22:02.202
- OH, COME ON.

22:02.250 --> 22:04.138
- JUST--JUST FIND A COMB

22:04.180 --> 22:05.488
WITH A FEW STRANDS
OF HAIR,

22:05.530 --> 22:07.623
A TISSUE,
A CUP HE DRANK OUT OF.

22:07.670 --> 22:08.523
ALL RIGHT?

22:08.560 --> 22:10.004
A SAMPLE OF SALIVA OR HAIR,

22:10.050 --> 22:13.178
AND MY GUY
WILL RUN THE TEST.

22:13.220 --> 22:14.426
- MM-HMM.

22:14.470 --> 22:15.664
AND THEN WE KNOW
FOR SURE?

22:17.260 --> 22:18.534
- AND THEN YOU'LL KNOW
FOR SURE.

22:18.570 --> 22:19.810
AND THE LONGER YOU WAIT,

22:19.850 --> 22:21.226
THE HARDER IT'S
GONNA BE TO FIND OUT,

22:21.270 --> 22:23.500
NO MATTER
WHICH WAY IT GOES.

22:24.480 --> 22:25.640
[glass clinks]

22:27.000 --> 22:28.444
- POT ROAST.

22:28.480 --> 22:29.856
- JUST SO YOU KNOW...
- YEAH.

22:29.900 --> 22:32.539
- TODAY, ON ME.

22:32.590 --> 22:34.478
- BREAK
A DECADES-OLD TRADITION?

22:34.520 --> 22:35.555
WHY START NOW?

22:35.590 --> 22:36.511
- I'M TRYING TO BE NICE,

22:36.560 --> 22:38.619
'CAUSE YOU'RE BEING
SO NICE ABOUT DREW.

22:38.660 --> 22:40.218
- YOU KIDDIN' ME?
I SHOULD BE THANKING YOU.

22:40.250 --> 22:41.353
HE'S A GREAT KID.

22:41.390 --> 22:43.494
- SERIOUSLY, THANK YOU.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.521
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

22:45.570 --> 22:47.390
TELL YOU WHAT,
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO THANK ME,

22:47.430 --> 22:48.567
YOU CAN HELP ME
FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO

22:48.600 --> 22:49.806
ABOUT YO-YO AND HADDIE.

22:49.850 --> 22:51.397
HE'S JUST CONSTANTLY
TOUCHING HER.

22:51.430 --> 22:53.057
- UCH. I DON'T KNOW.
DON'T ASK ME.

22:53.090 --> 22:54.250
AMBER JUST MAKES OUT
IN A CAR

22:54.300 --> 22:55.528
LIKE A NORMAL TEENAGER.

22:55.580 --> 22:56.979
- I SWEAR, THIS KID'S
GOT, LIKE, EIGHT HANDS.

22:57.030 --> 22:58.122
- WELL, MAYBE
IT'S A COMPLIMENT, YOU KNOW.

22:58.160 --> 23:00.196
HE'S SHOWING YOU HOW COMFORTABLE
HE FEELS AROUND YOU.

23:00.240 --> 23:01.434
- WELL, THAT IS
EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE

23:01.480 --> 23:03.334
OF HOW I WANT HIM
TO FEEL.

23:03.380 --> 23:04.995
HE'S
LIKE GROPEY GROPERSON.

23:05.030 --> 23:06.850
- HEY, MAYBE THE MORE
THEY DO IT IN PUBLIC,

23:06.900 --> 23:08.720
THE LESS THEY DO IT
IN PRIVATE.

23:08.760 --> 23:10.489
IT'S JUST A THEORY.
- IT'S NOT HELPING.

23:10.520 --> 23:11.589
- HEY, WHERE'S CROSBY?

23:11.630 --> 23:13.552
I KEEP CALLING HIM,
AND HE DOESN'T CALL ME BACK.

23:13.590 --> 23:14.454
- I DON'T KNOW.

23:14.490 --> 23:16.037
JUST BUSY DOING
CROSBY STUFF, I GUESS.

23:16.080 --> 23:17.217

23:17.250 --> 23:18.456

23:18.500 --> 23:19.455

23:19.500 --> 23:21.047
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

23:21.080 --> 23:22.490
THIS IS BIG NEWS, OKAY?

23:22.530 --> 23:23.974

23:24.020 --> 23:26.181

23:26.230 --> 23:27.561
- PFFT! SHUT UP.

23:27.610 --> 23:29.089
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ACTUALLY
TELLING ME SOMETHING.

23:29.130 --> 23:30.051
- I'M SERIOUS.
LISTEN TO ME.

23:30.090 --> 23:32.718
HE HAS A FIVE-YEAR-OLD BOY
NAMED JABBAR.

23:32.750 --> 23:34.854
- THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD
MAKE UP THAT NAME.

23:34.890 --> 23:36.505
- I'M SERIOUS.
HE HAS A LITTLE BOY, OKAY?

23:36.550 --> 23:38.302

- SINCE FIVE YEARS AGO.

23:38.340 --> 23:39.375

WHEN HAVE YOU KNOWN?

23:39.410 --> 23:40.513
- OH, COUPLE WEEKS.

23:40.550 --> 23:41.278
- A COUPLE WEEKS?

23:41.310 --> 23:42.481
- DON'T MAKE IT
ABOUT THE FACT

23:42.520 --> 23:43.680
THAT YOU HAVEN'T KNOWN
UNTIL NOW.

23:43.730 --> 23:44.583
- HOW COULD YOU
KEEP THAT FROM ME?

23:44.630 --> 23:46.279
YOU'RE THE WORST LIAR
IN THE FAMILY.

23:46.320 --> 23:47.389
- HE ASKED ME
NOT TO TELL ANYBODY.

23:47.420 --> 23:49.524
- AND YOU ACTUALLY
DID THAT?

23:49.560 --> 23:50.788
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'VE KNOWN THIS.

23:50.840 --> 23:52.319
- WOULD YOU GET OVER IT?
YOU KNOW NOW.

23:52.360 --> 23:54.248
- CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.

23:54.290 --> 23:55.257
- DON'T HIT ME.

23:55.290 --> 23:57.565
- AND I GOT
THE ORGANIC KIWIS.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.807
HARMONY WON'T EAT

24:04.580 --> 24:05.604

SYDNEY, TIARA.

24:10.930 --> 24:11.954

24:12.000 --> 24:14.377
- UM, HARMONY?

24:14.410 --> 24:17.516
CAN I TRY TO BE
THE PRINCESS THIS TIME?

24:17.550 --> 24:19.689
- BUT I'M ALWAYS
THE PRINCESS.

24:21.770 --> 24:25.069
- BUT MAYBE I CAN TRY
BEING THE PRINCESS THIS TIME.

24:25.110 --> 24:27.044
- OKAY.

24:28.630 --> 24:30.188
WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO?

24:30.220 --> 24:32.597
- I DON'T KNOW.

24:32.640 --> 24:35.427
- MAYBE YOU WANT TO TELL
YOUR SUBJECTS THERE'S A BALL.

24:35.470 --> 24:38.291
- UM, THERE'S
GONNA BE A BALL.

24:38.330 --> 24:39.297
- I DON'T WANT
TO GO TO A BALL.

24:39.330 --> 24:40.570
BALLS ARE BORING.

24:40.610 --> 24:42.225
- YEAH, I THOUGHT SO, TOO.

24:42.270 --> 24:44.477

WHO'S BEEN WORKING
UNDERCOVER,

24:48.240 --> 24:50.344
AND NOW SHE'S
STAGING A COUP.

24:50.380 --> 24:52.200
- HOW DO YOU KNOW
WHAT A COUP IS?

24:52.240 --> 24:53.992
- MY MOM TOLD ME THAT'S
WHAT HAPPENED IN THAILAND

24:54.040 --> 24:56.452
WHEN EVERYONE
GOT TIRED OF THE KING.

24:56.490 --> 24:58.594

28:54.560 --> 28:57.620
YOU HAVE TO DO

29:19.860 --> 29:21.191
IT SHOULD

THE BEST MOMENT OF MY LIFE.

30:15.670 --> 30:16.978
- YOU'RE ROTTEN.

30:18.430 --> 30:21.433
- SO HOW DID "OPERATION
DETHRONE HARMONY" GO?

30:21.470 --> 30:22.949
- IT WAS A DISASTER.

30:22.990 --> 30:24.958
- YEAH?
HARMONY WOULDN'T ABDICATE?

30:24.990 --> 30:27.049
- NO, SYDNEY HATED
BEING THE PRINCESS.

30:27.100 --> 30:28.260
- WELL,
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG

30:28.300 --> 30:30.336
WITH STAYING A MEMBER
OF THE PROLETARIAT.

30:30.380 --> 30:31.449
- IT'S MY FAULT, TOO.

30:31.480 --> 30:32.890
I MADE HER DO IT.

30:32.930 --> 30:36.229
I'M SUCH A CONTROL FREAK,
AREN'T I?

30:36.280 --> 30:38.168
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
WHERE YOU SAY, "NO, YOU'RE NOT.

30:38.210 --> 30:39.518
"YOU WERE JUST TRYING
TO TEACH YOUR DAUGHTER

30:39.560 --> 30:40.868
TO STAND UP FOR HERSELF."

30:41.900 --> 30:42.867
- DOES TELLING ME
EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD SAY

30:42.910 --> 30:44.935
MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE LESS
OF A CONTROL FREAK?

30:44.980 --> 30:46.356
- ALL RIGHT, FINE. FINE.

30:46.390 --> 30:48.563
THIS IS WHO I AM.
I AM GOING TO ACCEPT IT.

30:48.600 --> 30:49.669
I'M A CONTROL FREAK.

30:49.700 --> 30:51.042
I DON'T DO ANYTHING
SPONTANEOUS,

30:51.090 --> 30:52.808
LIKE HOOK UP ON A MERRY-GO-ROUND
IN TILDEN PARK.

30:52.850 --> 30:54.420
- [laughs]
THAT'S STILL BOTHERING YOU?

30:54.470 --> 30:56.051
AW, COME ON!

30:56.090 --> 30:58.012
COME ON,
YOU'RE VERY CRAZY.

30:58.060 --> 30:59.709
YOU DO CRAZY STUFF.

30:59.750 --> 31:00.842
-IDO?

31:00.890 --> 31:01.857
- YES, YES.

31:01.890 --> 31:03.858
WE'RE VERY WILD.

31:03.890 --> 31:05.858
WE WENT
ON THAT RIVER RAFTING TRIP.

31:05.890 --> 31:08.063
REMEMBER,
THERE WERE RAPIDS?

31:08.100 --> 31:09.510
- THERE WEREN'T RAPIDS.

31:09.550 --> 31:11.370
- THERE WEREN'T RAPIDS,
BUT THERE WAS A CURRENT.

31:11.420 --> 31:13.581
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS
A VERY STRONG CURRENT.

31:13.630 --> 31:15.313
[laughs]

31:15.350 --> 31:17.796
- I'M GONNA GO
CHECK FOR A PULSE.

31:17.840 --> 31:19.558
- COME ON! NO!
CO--

31:19.600 --> 31:22.592
WE WENT ON A PARASAILING TRIP
FOR OUR HONEYMOON.

31:22.630 --> 31:24.427
THAT WAS--
WELL, I WENT ON IT,

31:24.460 --> 31:26.633
BUT YOU WERE
RIGHT ON THE SHORE,

31:26.670 --> 31:27.944
CHEERING ME ON.

31:29.810 --> 31:31.630
[video game laser blasts]

31:31.680 --> 31:32.840
- NO, THANKS, I GOT IT.

31:32.890 --> 31:34.437
- YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE
GONNA MAKE ME READ

31:34.470 --> 31:36.358
THIS INCOMPREHENSIBLE BOOK,
THE LEAST YOU COULD DO

31:36.410 --> 31:39.163
WOULD BE TO ASK LUKE SKYWALKER
TO TURN DOWN THE VOLUME!

31:39.200 --> 31:41.680
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

31:41.720 --> 31:43.711
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
PLAYING BALL WITH UNCLE ADAM.

31:43.760 --> 31:45.796
- YEAH, HE CANCELED.

31:45.830 --> 31:48.139
I DON'T KNOW,
HE HAD TO TAKE MAX

31:48.180 --> 31:50.273
TO GET ICE CREAM OR SOMETHING.
I DON'T KNOW.

31:50.320 --> 31:51.582
- ICE CREAM?

31:52.560 --> 31:54.448
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU GUYS HAD A PLAN.

31:54.490 --> 31:56.970
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

32:01.360 --> 32:03.089
[explosion]

32:04.470 --> 32:05.562
[sighs]

32:07.710 --> 32:10.156
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT
THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS

32:10.200 --> 32:12.748
OF DUMPING THIS MUCH
ESTROGEN INTO THE BAY?

32:12.790 --> 32:14.371
- DON'T WORRY.
IT'S VERY LOW DOSAGE.

32:14.410 --> 32:20.417
OKAY, GOOD-BYE TO
ALL THE DEVICES AND BARRIERS

32:20.450 --> 32:23.066
AND HORMONES THAT I'VE BEEN
USING ALL THESE YEARS

32:23.110 --> 32:25.340
TO AVOID GETTING PREGNANT,

32:25.390 --> 32:27.005
AND HELLO TO--

32:27.040 --> 32:29.622
CROSS MY FINGERS, I HOPE
I'M NOT JINXING ANYTHING--

32:29.670 --> 32:33.254
A LITTLE
MINI KATIE-CROSBY BEING.

32:33.290 --> 32:36.350
- UH, LISTEN,
BEFORE YOU THROW THIS

32:36.400 --> 32:38.982
INTO THE BAY
AND STERILIZE ALL THE FISH,

32:39.020 --> 32:41.432
I GOTTA TELL YOU SOMETHING.

32:43.610 --> 32:45.532
I HAVE A SON.

32:45.920 --> 32:46.955
- WHAT?

32:46.990 --> 32:48.332
- I--I HAVE--
I HAVE A SON.

32:48.380 --> 32:51.019
I HAD A FLING 5 1/2 YEARS AGO
WITH HIS MOTHER,

32:51.070 --> 32:52.856
AND A MONTH AND HALF AGO,

32:52.900 --> 32:54.788
SHE MOVED BACK
TO BERKELEY

32:54.830 --> 32:55.865
AND INTRODUCED ME
TO HIM.

32:55.900 --> 32:58.551
HIS NAME'S JABBAR.

32:58.590 --> 33:01.309
- UM...WOW.

33:01.350 --> 33:02.692
- I'M REALLY SORRY
I DIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT IT.

33:02.730 --> 33:05.381
YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST TRYING
TO GET TO KNOW HIM,

33:05.430 --> 33:06.738
AND I DIDN'T KNOW
WHEN THE RIGHT TIME--

33:06.770 --> 33:07.759
- WAS THIS THE LITTLE BOY

33:07.810 --> 33:09.664
THAT YOU BROUGHT
TO THE STUDIO?

33:09.710 --> 33:11.598
- YES, THAT WAS HIM.

33:14.190 --> 33:16.192
- YOU DIDN'T INTRODUCE HIM
TO ME.

33:16.230 --> 33:19.097
- NO, I--I DID NOT.

33:19.130 --> 33:20.358
I DIDN'T INTRODUCE HIM
TO YOU.

33:20.410 --> 33:22.332
YOU KNOW, IT WAS--
IT WAS CONFUSING.

33:22.370 --> 33:23.849
- WELL, I'M SURE IT WAS
CONFUSING,

33:23.890 --> 33:26.336
BUT YOU'VE ALSO BEEN
SNEAKING AROUND

33:26.380 --> 33:28.541
AND HIDING HIM
AND--AND--

33:28.590 --> 33:30.410
AND KEEPING HIM FROM ME
FOR OVER A MONTH.

33:30.450 --> 33:32.179
- I'M SORRY IF I DIDN'T
TELL YOU RIGHT OFF THE BAT,

33:32.210 --> 33:33.654
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN
A LITTLE BIT PSYCHO

33:33.700 --> 33:35.179
WITH THIS WHOLE BABY THING.
- OH, PSYCHO?

33:35.220 --> 33:36.482
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL
WANTING TO HAVE A BABY IS?

33:36.530 --> 33:38.009
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
THAT WAS SOMETHING

33:38.050 --> 33:39.278
THAT WE BOTH REALLY WANTED.

33:41.220 --> 33:42.141
- I DIDN'T MEAN TO 5--

33:42.190 --> 33:45.182
- NO, YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T KEEP PUSHING YOU.

33:45.230 --> 33:47.460
IT'S NOT FAIR
TO EITHER OF US.

33:55.550 --> 33:58.303
- YOU CAN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION
WHY YOU BLEW DREW OFF?

33:58.340 --> 34:00.092
- WELL, IT'S NOT
THAT SIMPLE, SARAH.

34:00.140 --> 34:01.129
- IT'S NOT THAT HARD, ADAM.

34:01.170 --> 34:03.309
YOU SAID YOU'D MEET HIM
AT THE BASEBALL DIAMOND,

34:03.350 --> 34:04.681
JUST MEET HIM
AT THE BASEBALL DIAMOND.

34:04.730 --> 34:07.551
- LOOK, AT SOME POINT
IN THE DISTANT PAST,

34:07.590 --> 34:08.761
I HAD PROMISED MAX

34:08.800 --> 34:11.143
THAT I WOULD TAKE HIM
TO YOGURTLAND THIS AFTERNOON.

34:11.180 --> 34:12.932
I FORGOT ABOUT IT,
HE DIDN'T.

34:12.980 --> 34:15.357
AND YOU CAN'T JUST CHANGE
PLANS ON MAX,

34:15.390 --> 34:17.142
BECAUSE HE FALLS APART.

34:17.190 --> 34:19.112
- HE'S NOT THE ONLY KID

34:19.160 --> 34:21.731
WHO HAS BEEN DEALT
A ROUGH HAND.

34:21.780 --> 34:22.599
- I KNOW.

34:22.640 --> 34:24.084
- ALL DREW HAS DONE
HIS WHOLE LIFE

34:24.130 --> 34:26.598
IS SIT AROUND AND WAIT
FOR HIS FATHER TO SHOW UP.

34:26.650 --> 34:27.981
WAIT FOR HIM AT SCHOOL,

34:28.030 --> 34:30.021
WAIT FOR HIM AFTER SOCCER,

34:30.060 --> 34:31.470
WAIT FOR HIM
ON WHOLE WEEKENDS

34:31.510 --> 34:33.023
THAT WERE HIS WEEKENDS
TO TAKE THEM,

34:33.070 --> 34:34.332
AND HE WOULD NEVER SHOW UP!

34:34.380 --> 34:35.449
AND THE LAST THING
HE NEEDS

34:35.480 --> 34:37.471
IS ANOTHER HALF-ASSED
FATHER FIGURE!

34:37.520 --> 34:38.828
- HALF-ASSED--

34:42.700 --> 34:43.860
[groans]

34:46.560 --> 34:47.766
I WOULD HAVE LOVED

34:47.800 --> 34:50.007
TO HAVE GONE TO THE BALLPARK
THIS AFTERNOON.

34:50.050 --> 34:51.142
IT WAS
BECAUSE OF YOUR SON

34:51.190 --> 34:53.215
THAT I GOT TO GO TO THE BALLPARK
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

34:53.260 --> 34:55.353
AND THESE LAST FEW DAYS
HAVE BEEN GREAT,

34:55.400 --> 34:56.844
PLAYING BALL
WITH THOSE BOYS.

34:56.880 --> 34:59.769
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE...

34:59.820 --> 35:02.675
MAX DIDN'T HAVE
A "SITUATION."

35:03.820 --> 35:07.711
AND THAT IS WHAT WAS SO HARD
ABOUT THIS AFTERNOON.

35:11.100 --> 35:12.749
I'M SORRY.

35:22.290 --> 35:23.905
- LAST COUPLE OF DAYS...

35:28.290 --> 35:31.498
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE DREW
HAD A FATHER...

35:31.540 --> 35:33.633
THANKS TO YOU.

35:38.230 --> 35:40.949
- HE'S A GOOD BALLPLAYER.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.160
- REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

35:50.070 --> 35:52.072
- PREPARE
TO BE WHISKED AWAY.

35:52.110 --> 35:53.031
- HI, HONEY.

35:53.080 --> 35:55.139
- YOUR MOTHER IS WATCHING
SYDNEY TONIGHT.

35:55.180 --> 35:56.317
- I HAVE A BRIEF DUE
IN THE MORNING.

35:56.360 --> 35:57.497
- DON'T WORRY.

35:57.530 --> 36:00.215
I'VE GOT IT ALL UNDER CONTROL
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

36:00.260 --> 36:01.875
- OH, BOY.

36:01.910 --> 36:03.662
- COME ON.

36:03.710 --> 36:05.359
- [laughs]

36:09.890 --> 36:11.846
THEY'RE CLOSED.

36:11.890 --> 36:13.369
- YEAH,
THAT'S THE POINT, JULES.

36:13.410 --> 36:15.992
THAT WAY WE HAVE
THE WHOLE POOL TO OURSELVES.

36:16.030 --> 36:18.021
- BUT THAT'S TRESPASSING.

36:18.070 --> 36:19.139
- IS IT?

36:19.170 --> 36:20.205
- NO, I MEAN,
IT'S A MISDEMEANOR.

36:20.240 --> 36:21.548
- OH, MY GOD!

36:21.590 --> 36:23.410
- THEY COULD CHARGE US
WITH BREAKING AND ENTERING.

36:23.450 --> 36:24.860
- THEY COULD.
THEY PROBABLY COULD.

36:24.900 --> 36:26.765
WE WOULD GET INTO
A LOT OF TROUBLE, WOULDN'T WE?

36:26.800 --> 36:28.006
HERE, COME ON.

36:28.040 --> 36:29.450
RIGHT THERE.

36:29.490 --> 36:30.627
COME ON, BRAVERMAN.

36:30.670 --> 36:31.739
- OH, MY GOD.

36:39.360 --> 36:40.987
- THANK YOU.

36:41.020 --> 36:41.987
HEY.

36:42.020 --> 36:42.941
- HEY.

36:42.990 --> 36:45.197
- AMBER DIDN'T DRIVE YOU
TO DRINK, DID SHE?

36:45.230 --> 36:46.026
- OH, NO, NO.

36:46.060 --> 36:47.095
NO, NOT EXACTLY.

36:47.130 --> 36:49.405
BUT, UM, I WILL
HAVE A BEER.

36:49.440 --> 36:51.089
- YEAH.
- SOMETHING IN AN ALE?

36:51.130 --> 36:52.062
- SURE.

36:52.100 --> 36:54.898
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SEE
YOUR I.D., THOUGH.

36:54.930 --> 36:56.579
BAR POLICY.

36:56.620 --> 36:59.248
- OH, OKAY.

36:59.760 --> 37:02.797
- HUH. OH, REALLY?

37:02.840 --> 37:05.456
- PLEASE DON'T HOLD
THE EYEBROW PIERCING AGAINST ME.

37:05.490 --> 37:08.186
IT WAS
A DRUNKEN COLLEGE DARE.

37:08.220 --> 37:11.701
- 1983.

37:11.740 --> 37:13.321
- YEP.

37:13.360 --> 37:14.497
[clears throat]

37:14.540 --> 37:19.716
SO, UH, AMBER TOLD ME
ABOUT THE PAPER.

37:19.750 --> 37:21.957
- OH, SHE DID?

37:21.990 --> 37:23.161
I'M REALLY IMPRESSED.

37:23.200 --> 37:24.371
I COULDN'T TELL YOU.

37:24.410 --> 37:26.685
- AND HER NEW PAPER
WASN'T HALF BAD, EITHER.

37:26.720 --> 37:28.062
- DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE SOMETHING

37:28.100 --> 37:29.306
THAT CAME OFF THE INTERNET,
DOES IT?

37:29.350 --> 37:32.239
- NO, NO, NO,
IT SOUNDED JUST LIKE AMBER.

37:32.280 --> 37:34.168
THERE'S NOT
A LOT OF DOWNLOADED PAPERS

37:34.210 --> 37:35.962
THAT USE THE WORD "SUCK"
WITH SUCH FREQUENCY.

37:36.010 --> 37:36.999
- [chuckles]

37:37.040 --> 37:39.486
WOW, THAT'S GREAT.

37:39.530 --> 37:40.736
I'M PROUD OF HER.

37:40.770 --> 37:44.183
- COURSE, IT WASN'T
NEARLY AS CAPTIVATING

37:44.220 --> 37:47.701
AND INSIGHTFUL
AS THAT FIRST PAPER.

37:54.820 --> 37:59.166
- SO AN EYEBROW PIERCING.
HMM.

37:59.200 --> 38:02.442
- HMM.
- BEGS THE QUESTION, TATTOOS?

38:02.480 --> 38:04.687
- NO, NO TATTOOS.

38:13.600 --> 38:14.589
- HEY.

38:14.630 --> 38:15.836
- HEY.

38:15.870 --> 38:18.043
- JABBAR LEFT THIS
AT MY PLACE LAST TIME,

38:18.080 --> 38:20.844
AND I WAS GONNA TAKE IT
TO MY SISTER'S DNA GUY,

38:20.880 --> 38:22.040
BUT THEN I THOUGHT,

38:22.090 --> 38:23.364
JABBAR'S ORAL HYGIENE

38:23.400 --> 38:26.324
IS A LOT MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THAT, SO...

38:31.170 --> 38:32.614
- I GET IT.

38:32.650 --> 38:33.856
I GET IT.

38:33.890 --> 38:36.131
YOU KNOW, WE DON'T REALLY
KNOW EACH OTHER VERY WELL,

38:36.170 --> 38:37.990
AND I JUST DROPPED
THIS THING

38:38.030 --> 38:39.065
RIGHT ON YOUR LAP.

38:39.100 --> 38:43.548
YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO WANT TO KNOW FOR SURE.

38:43.590 --> 38:46.002
- YEAH. I KNOW FOR SURE.

38:46.040 --> 38:47.689
- I KNOW,

38:47.730 --> 38:49.698
BUT LET'S JUST TAKE
THE TEST ANYWAY.

38:49.740 --> 38:52.766
LET'S MAKE
YOUR ANNOYING SISTER HAPPY.

38:54.740 --> 38:56.253
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE,
BUT...

38:56.290 --> 38:57.848
- WE CAN TRY.
- WE CAN TRY.

38:57.880 --> 39:00.121
- IF THEY PROSECUTE ME
FOR TRESPASSING

39:00.160 --> 39:01.297
WITH CRIMINAL INTENT,

39:01.330 --> 39:02.536
THAT'S CONSIDERED
A FELONY.

39:02.580 --> 39:03.979
- UH-HUH.
- I COULD BE DISBARRED.

39:04.030 --> 39:05.224
- OH.

39:05.270 --> 39:06.783
- I DON'T EVEN WANT TO THINK

39:06.820 --> 39:09.994
ABOUT WHAT KIND OF FINE
OR JAIL TIME THAT ENTAILS.

39:10.030 --> 39:10.849
- I WOULDN'T.

39:10.900 --> 39:12.231
- YOU WOULD HAVE TO
GO BACK TO WORK.

39:12.280 --> 39:13.235
- OH.
- WHICH WOULD MEAN

39:13.280 --> 39:14.235
THERE'S NO ONE
TO WATCH SYDNEY,

39:14.280 --> 39:15.793
BECAUSE I'M IN JAIL.

39:15.830 --> 39:17.240
SO, UM, NO.

39:17.280 --> 39:19.248
NO. NO,_NO_, NO, NO!
[glggllng]

39:19.280 --> 39:21.248
AAH!

39:21.280 --> 39:24.454
[laughing]

39:24.500 --> 39:26.559
OKAY, YOU WIN.

39:29.430 --> 39:31.045
- CHOCOLATE CHIP PANCAKES?
