00:03.600 --> 00:06.800
<b>F R A S I E R (10x20)
- <i>Farewell, Nervosa</i> -

00:08.300 --> 00:13.300
Which not only helps in the healing 
process, but also provides one 
with the confidence to go forward,

00:13.500 --> 00:17.400
in spite of the fear 
this kind of trauma can cause.

00:17.600 --> 00:21.300
Honestly, I can't say enough 
about these medicated bandage strips.

00:21.800 --> 00:24.500
But thank you for asking, Jordan.

00:25.100 --> 00:29.200
Up next is the stock market report 
with Julia Wilcox.

00:31.200 --> 00:34.600
Hello, Avery. Impeccable timing.
-Good to see you, Frasier.

00:34.750 --> 00:37.750
Yes, hello. 
Oh, careful, careful.  
Paper cut.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.800
Yes, I caught the last half hour 
of your show.

00:41.100 --> 00:44.100
Ah.  Oh, Roz, come meet 
an old friend of mine.

00:44.250 --> 00:47.450
Avery McManus, this is Roz Doyle, 
my producer.  
-Lovely to meet you. -Same here.

00:47.650 --> 00:51.150
Avery and I used to live across 
the hall from each other back 
at Oxford, now he lives in Seattle.

00:51.350 --> 00:54.650
A very accomplished accountant who's 
going to take me on as a client.
-Well...

00:54.800 --> 00:59.200
...my taxes could use some 
serious <i>doing</i>. 
-Roz, he's married.

00:59.400 --> 01:03.250
I tell you what: I'll be back 
in about an hour to go over 
this month's "Best of".

01:03.450 --> 01:05.900
Oh, I don't think an hour 
is going to be long enough, Frasier.

01:06.050 --> 01:09.200
Your finances are a mess.  
Your spending's out of control.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.800
Well that's impossible.  
I'm very prudent.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.200
Then what about this $9,0000 
caviar bill from last month?

01:16.600 --> 01:20.000
And what's with you and wine?
I had to take on an associate

01:20.200 --> 01:24.100
just to go through your sherry 
receipts.  And then...
-Gosh, you know,

01:24.300 --> 01:27.300
I've completely forgotten myself.  
How is Amanda?  I don't believe 
I've seen her since the wedding.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.800
Amanda's great.  
She made partner.

01:29.920 --> 01:33.620
Okay, everybody, the "I'm a Pathetic 
Loser" show is over.

01:33.800 --> 01:38.500
My listeners are not pathetic 
losers.  -I wasn't referring 
to your listeners.

01:39.700 --> 01:42.300
You're Julia Wilcox.
-Yes, I am. 

01:42.500 --> 01:47.100
You wrote "Practical Applications 
of Econometrics".  -Yes, I did.
-I loved that book.

01:47.700 --> 01:51.200
Avery McManus. 
-Oh, it's a pleasure to meet 
a fan, Avery.

01:51.800 --> 01:55.000
A fan is someone 
who enjoys your work.

01:55.800 --> 01:59.000
Yes, and do you know what they 
call someone who can't stand 
your work?

01:59.200 --> 02:01.800
In your case, the public.

02:02.500 --> 02:06.800
She was supposed to say "What?" 
and I was going to say "Me."
Oh, come on, let's get out of here.

02:11.500 --> 02:14.300
Ow!  How come 
you only rub where it hurts?

02:14.500 --> 02:17.500
Your sons hired me to torture you 
so that's what I'm doing.

02:18.500 --> 02:21.200
Ow!  Eddie, Daddy's in trouble.  
Sic her!

02:25.500 --> 02:29.100
Okay, all done, old man.  
And I hope you got your griping 
out of your system,

02:29.300 --> 02:32.600
because I need you to be on your 
best behavior next time.
-Why?

02:32.720 --> 02:35.520
Because, the agency won't 
assign me any more clients

02:35.700 --> 02:38.900
until an evaluator observes me 
at work.
-Oh, geez.

02:39.050 --> 02:42.250
I don't want to go on display 
like some trained seal.

02:42.600 --> 02:45.400
Please?  
I'll give you some treats.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.700
Treats, huh?  

02:48.950 --> 02:50.450
Okay.

02:52.200 --> 02:55.000
Hey, Fraizh.  How was 
your trip to the accountant?

02:55.200 --> 02:57.400
Fine, fine.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.700
Uh, why are all these lights on?

03:05.400 --> 03:09.500
All right, I'll be honest with you.  
Avery had some very stern warnings 
for me.

03:09.700 --> 03:12.700
The situation isn't dire,

03:13.000 --> 03:17.200
but it could become serious 
if I don't change my ways.
-That doesn't sound too tough.

03:17.500 --> 03:20.800
Get balcony seats at the opera.
-And stop throwing away your change.

03:20.950 --> 03:23.350
Oh, that was one time!

03:23.600 --> 03:26.600
And if you'd seen that cashier's 
fingernails, you'd have done 
the same thing.

03:26.800 --> 03:30.200
All right, the point is 
I have to come up with a plan.  
A plan...

03:30.400 --> 03:33.300
Perhaps a ruminative latte 
will do me some good at Nervosa.
-What?

03:33.500 --> 03:36.500
You just had a whole new espresso 
machine shipped here from Italy!

03:36.700 --> 03:39.000
Yes, well I'm waiting for the cups!

03:39.600 --> 03:43.800
Besides, Nervosa is more to me 
than just a place for coffee. 
It's my refuge,

03:44.100 --> 03:48.000
my sanctuary for contemplation.  
Oh! Oh, I've just had 
a cost-saving idea!

03:48.150 --> 03:52.050
Daphne, you're family now and yet 
I still pay you full price 
for Dad's therapy.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.400
All right, I'll keep thinking.  
Off I go!

03:57.400 --> 04:00.000
This happens every time 
you hire a new accountant.

04:00.150 --> 04:02.850
You let their fear get to you.  
But remember:

04:03.000 --> 04:06.200
it's Avery's job to worry 
about your finances, not yours.

04:06.400 --> 04:09.400
Yes, of course it is, of course 
it is.  He's the professional.

04:09.600 --> 04:13.100
Thanks so much, Niles, 
that's really quite helpful.

04:13.400 --> 04:17.500
I feel better now.  Excuse me, 
change my shortbread order 
to tart tatin.

04:18.100 --> 04:21.500
One for my brother, please. 
A la mode.
-He's back.

04:24.100 --> 04:26.700
You ready for some more music, 
Seattle?

04:27.900 --> 04:29.200
Great!

04:35.200 --> 04:37.400
I quite agree!

04:38.500 --> 04:42.300
I am sorry, young man. If we wanted 
to hear your music, we would attend 
one of your concerts.

04:42.450 --> 04:44.450
In the bus station.

04:44.600 --> 04:47.700
Well, people seem to like it.  
Here, they clap along,

04:47.850 --> 04:51.650
and it's been enough to keep me 
out of the three piece cage.
-The what?

04:51.850 --> 04:53.850
The suit, man, the suit.

04:54.800 --> 04:57.800
Excuse me, is there a problem?
-Well, yes, as a matter of fact 
there is.  This man...

04:58.000 --> 05:01.400
is making it impossible for me 
to converse with my brother.
-I think he's great.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.600
Ah.  I understand.  
You two are friends.

05:05.800 --> 05:09.400
Perhaps you used to "gig" together 
in your salad days.

05:10.200 --> 05:14.100
But if you wish to alter 
the atmosphere of this cafe, 
I suggest you consult with the owner.

05:14.300 --> 05:18.000
I am the owner. 
-Oh really.  Well, I'm Frasier Crane, 
it's a pleasure.

05:18.200 --> 05:20.000
Maureen Nervosa.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.400
Really?

05:22.600 --> 05:26.000
Well, I happen to be one of your 
core customers, Ms. Nervosa.

05:26.150 --> 05:29.950
In fact, I spend over $3,000 a year 
here, which I just found out today.

05:30.300 --> 05:34.600
Frasier, people are starting to stare. 
Let's just come back tomorrow afternoon 
when the cafe is quieter.

05:34.800 --> 05:38.200
Actually, Ben will be playing afternoons 
from now on.  -Really?

05:38.400 --> 05:43.100
Well you know, I, I would think 
about that.  Although we do adore 
your establishment,

05:43.300 --> 05:46.600
if there is one thing we can find 
in Seattle, it is another coffee shop.

05:46.800 --> 05:50.200
Yeah, but not many of them will 
let you change in the men's room. 

05:51.500 --> 05:54.000
Now, I don't relish the idea 
of asking you this,

05:54.150 --> 05:57.350
but I'm afraid you will have 
to choose.  Either...
-I choose Ben.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
I see.  Well...

06:04.600 --> 06:07.600
Farewell, Nervosa.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.900
It's been a splendid decade,

06:10.100 --> 06:14.400
but I'm afraid your brew has become 
a bit too bold for my brother and me.

06:14.700 --> 06:17.700
Come, Niles, let's go.
-But, I don't want to go.

06:20.100 --> 06:24.300
Nervosa is my haven, my cocoon.
-This next one's called 
"The Wild Rover"!

06:29.400 --> 06:33.200
<i>I've been a wild rover, 
for many a year.</i>

06:33.400 --> 06:37.000
<i>And I spent all me money 
on whisky and beer.</i>

06:37.400 --> 06:41.000
<i>And now I'm returning 
with gold in great store,</i>

06:41.400 --> 06:47.200
<i>And I never will play 
the wild rover no more.</i>

06:48.200 --> 06:50.400
<i>And it's no, nay, never...
no, nay, never no more...</i>

06:50.890 --> 06:52.590
.

06:52.800 --> 06:57.400
My name is Frasier, 
this is my brother Niles. 

06:57.550 --> 06:59.450
We're thinking of making this 
our regular haunt.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.500
Way to go.

07:02.300 --> 07:05.500
We'll have two espressos, please.

07:05.700 --> 07:09.300
I'm sorry, and your name is?
-Steve. 
-Stephen. Outstanding.

07:09.700 --> 07:11.600
Just Steve.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.300
Steve.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.100
I look forward

07:16.300 --> 07:19.900
to years of this sort 
of lively banter.

07:25.600 --> 07:30.100
They found a way to bring 
the charm of an airport 
to a mid-town location.

07:30.500 --> 07:34.000
Now, Niles, let's try to be positive, 
this may be out new home.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.600
Yes, this will do nicely.

07:39.700 --> 07:42.500
This will be our regular table.

07:44.100 --> 07:47.800
And that will be our backup 
regular table.

07:50.400 --> 07:53.400
Oh, perhaps we should keep looking.
Hello, Julia.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.300
Hello, Frasier.

07:55.700 --> 07:58.300
Wow, who's this?  
Your stunt double?

08:00.000 --> 08:03.600
This is my brother Niles.  
Niles, I'd like you to meet 
my colleague, Julia Wilcox.

08:03.800 --> 08:06.400
How do you do?
-Wow, that's very good, Frasier,

08:06.550 --> 08:08.950
I didn't even see your lips move.

08:09.100 --> 08:12.900
I thought you always go to Nervosa.
-Well, sadly, no more.

08:13.100 --> 08:16.600
They've hired a terribly annoying 
folk singer,

08:16.800 --> 08:20.500
whose hideous noise-making 
has made it impossible for me 
to enjoy my one sanctuary.

08:20.620 --> 08:23.120
I didn't ask for your life story.

08:23.600 --> 08:27.000
Steve, I'm afraid we'll be taking 
these to go, thank you. 
-Oh, glad to hear it.

08:27.200 --> 08:30.500
Goodbye, Frasier. 
Goodbye, Emergency Frasier.

08:32.100 --> 08:34.200
I don't like her.

08:34.700 --> 08:38.100
I don't like her cafe anymore.  
Let's go...
Oh, thank you, Steve.

08:38.250 --> 08:41.850
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, 
but I'm afraid my brother and I 
will not be

08:42.000 --> 08:45.200
the everyday stalwarts 
I predicted we would be.
-Damn. 

08:46.500 --> 08:49.300
Every time I open my heart...

08:51.000 --> 08:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:22.500 --> 09:24.900
You know, Avery was always 
a bit of a playboy,

09:25.050 --> 09:27.650
but honestly I thought 
marriage would settle him down.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.600
I should just tell Julia that 
he's married. But then again, 
she's been so rude to me,

09:31.750 --> 09:35.450
why should I do something nice 
for her?  But then again, 
can I just sit idly by

09:35.600 --> 09:38.700
and keep my mouth shut?
-I can answer that one.

09:39.800 --> 09:45.000
Doesn't he wear a ring? 
-No, but I know he has one.  
I was at the wedding.

09:45.300 --> 09:49.100
Dad, you see I'm facing a perplexing 
dilemma, here.  Some guidance 
would be welcome.

09:49.300 --> 09:53.600
No, it wouldn't.  
You always ask my opinion, 
and then completely ignore it.

09:53.800 --> 09:58.100
Well this time, while I've got 
the floor, I'm gonnna talk about 
what I want to talk about.

09:58.500 --> 10:01.900
NBA referees need to enforce 
the traveling rule.

10:03.200 --> 10:07.500
It's dribble-one step-shoot, 
not dribble-step-step-step-STEP-shoot!

10:07.750 --> 10:09.350
Thank you.

10:12.100 --> 10:14.600
That was very helpful.

10:14.900 --> 10:17.700
I guess I'll just do 
what I always do:

10:17.900 --> 10:21.600
sort through this myself.
...All right, I'm off to Nervosa.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.400
No!

10:24.700 --> 10:29.000
I'm off to that... other place 
where young Steve works.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.700
No. 
That's Avery and Julia's place.

10:32.900 --> 10:36.300
Well, I hope you're both satisfied, 
now I don't know 
where the hell I'm going!

10:39.800 --> 10:43.900
I'm hashing over an ethical dilemma, 
so I think I could use 

10:47.500 --> 10:49.900
Uh, I've got a lot to ponder, 
so I think a large.

10:50.100 --> 10:53.100
I'm afraid we don't have large, 
sir.  We have piccolo,

10:53.300 --> 10:56.100
macho, mucho and mucho macho.

10:59.100 --> 11:00.900
I see.

11:01.900 --> 11:06.900
Uh, do you happen to know 
what size would correspond 
to a Nervosa grande?

11:07.200 --> 11:10.400
No. But our mucho is about the same

11:10.600 --> 11:14.100
as the semi-colossal over 
at Don't Spill the Beans.
-Ah, ah, all right.

11:14.300 --> 11:16.300
I know that their colossal

11:16.600 --> 11:20.700
is comparable to a Nervosa grande, 
so the semi-colossal

11:20.900 --> 11:24.200
would be three quarters 
of a colossal, so...

11:24.400 --> 11:26.900
the mucho and the semi-colossal 
would be equivalent...

11:27.100 --> 11:29.600
so I should have the mucho macho.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.900
But only fill it five-eighths.

11:33.100 --> 11:36.600
Yes sir.  For fifty cents extra, 
we can pre-heat the vessel.

11:37.100 --> 11:40.500
No.  Can we just move this along, 
please?  -I understand completely.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.200
Your zip-code, please?

11:43.900 --> 11:47.300
You don't have to give your 
real zip if you don't want to.

11:47.900 --> 11:50.100
Then what's the point?

11:51.000 --> 11:53.600
It unlocks the cash register.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.600
Put in whatever code you wish.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.200
Here we are.

12:00.400 --> 12:03.700
Now, I'd just like a cup of coffee 
and a quiet place to drink it.

12:03.900 --> 12:05.400
Can do, sir.

12:05.800 --> 12:08.000
Okay, here's your change.

12:08.350 --> 12:10.200
You're number four,

12:10.400 --> 12:12.900
I'll bring it to your bean bag.

12:31.400 --> 12:34.800
Now, you have a bullet lodged 
in your hip, correct?

12:35.500 --> 12:36.700
Do I?

12:37.600 --> 12:41.100
Oh, that's right, I do.  
Sometimes I forget, 
the way Daphne takes care of me.

12:41.300 --> 12:43.300
She's the best.

12:44.500 --> 12:47.500
All right. And how would you rate 
your level of comfort during therapy?

12:47.700 --> 12:51.900
Oh, I don't think you can come up 
with a number high enough, 
so I'll just say...

12:52.500 --> 12:53.800
thirty.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.600
Sorry.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.700
Oh, it's my nanny.  
Well, not MY nanny.

13:00.850 --> 13:02.950
Wouldn't that be somethin'?

13:03.150 --> 13:05.350
Do you mind?
-No, please, go ahead.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.100
Hi.

13:08.100 --> 13:11.700
What are you doing?  -What do you 
think? I'm makin' you look good. 
-Yeah, well stop it.

13:11.900 --> 13:16.400
My work speaks for itself. 
-Oh, Daphne, I love you,
but sometimes you can be so naive.

13:16.600 --> 13:20.700
Sure you're good at the job, 
but you need a little salesmanship.  
That's why I'm here.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.300
If you so much as...
-Sorry about that.

13:23.500 --> 13:26.800
Suzy got stuck in the laundry chute 
again. 
-Oh, poor thing.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.700
How old is she?  
-What's the difference? After 
tomorrow, she's not our nanny anymore.

13:34.300 --> 13:39.300
All right, shall we begin, Martin? 
-Are you kidding?  This is my 
favorite part of the day.

13:42.800 --> 13:45.900
Whenever you're ready, Daphne.
-First I like to start with some

13:46.050 --> 13:49.850
simple range-of-motion exercises 
to warm up the muscles.

13:52.200 --> 13:56.100
Oh, am I on a cloud?  
'Cause that's how it feels.

13:56.300 --> 13:58.500
Like I'm on a cloud.

13:59.600 --> 14:03.900
Then some strokes around the flexus 
smoothing out any knots.

14:04.400 --> 14:07.400
And do you feel any discomfort, 
Martin? 
-Discomfort?!

14:07.600 --> 14:11.100
Try disbelief.  
I don't know how she does it.

14:11.400 --> 14:14.800
You know, physical therapy shouldn't 
be a pleasure trip.  
It is challenging,

14:14.920 --> 14:18.620
healing work. You really need to be 
digging into the muscles there, 
Daphne.  -Yeah, I...

14:18.850 --> 14:20.750
Let me show you.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.700
Ahhhh! That did it, all right. 
-That's not so bad. I think you've 
just been pampered a little too long.

14:32.300 --> 14:35.500
That is the sound of progress.  
Think you can work like this?

14:36.050 --> 14:37.800
Watch me.

14:48.500 --> 14:52.800
You can stop checking the door.  
Frasier swore he'd never 
come back here.

14:53.200 --> 14:57.100
Oh, I'm not worried about him.  
Yes, we do have a pact 
to boycott Nervosa,

14:57.250 --> 15:00.650
but I only came in here because 
I saw you sitting alone 
and I thought you needed company.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.100
Are you ready for some more music?

15:05.500 --> 15:07.700
Oh, fudge.  Time to go.

15:07.900 --> 15:10.900
Why don't you like Ben?  
He's really nice.

15:11.100 --> 15:14.000
He was selling his CDs outside, 
I got "Abbey Road"...

15:14.120 --> 15:16.120
and the soundtrack from "Grease".

15:16.750 --> 15:19.750
I'm gonna need a little bit of help 
with this one. ...What about you, sir, 
what about you?

15:19.900 --> 15:22.900
Can you keep a steady beat for me?
-Sorry, no. 
-What do you think, Nervosa?

15:23.050 --> 15:25.250
Is he the man for the job?

15:27.500 --> 15:30.500
He doesn't really think you mean it.
-Go!

15:32.700 --> 15:36.800
If I do this, will you take a break?
-Yeah, I love breaks, bloke.  
He says yes!

15:42.900 --> 15:46.500
Sorry, are you going to stick 
with that 4/4 tempo? 
-Yeah, yeah.

15:48.300 --> 15:51.500
Would you call that sort of 
an andante feeling?
-Just shake it, okay?!

15:52.200 --> 15:56.200
<i>Tie me kangaroo down, sport, 
tie me kangaroo down.</i>

15:56.600 --> 16:00.500
<i>Tie me kangaroo down, sport, 
tie me kangaroo down.</i>

16:00.900 --> 16:05.100
<i>Watch me wallaby feed, mate, 
watch me wallaby feed.</i>

16:05.300 --> 16:09.300
<i>It's a dangerous breed, mate, 
watch me wallaby feed.</i>. 
All together now...

16:09.500 --> 16:13.500
<i>Tie me kangaroo down, sport, 
tie me kangaroo down.</i>

16:13.900 --> 16:17.300
<i>Tie me kangaroo down, sport, 
tie me kangaroo down.</i>

16:17.600 --> 16:19.600
Let's show 'em!

16:28.600 --> 16:30.100
Niles!

16:36.000 --> 16:38.800
Don't you run, you coward!

16:39.000 --> 16:40.800
I'll be right back.

16:41.100 --> 16:44.700
Oh, by the way, ten dollars is still 
the best price for "Quadrophenia".

16:50.600 --> 16:53.000
I thought you were 
<i>Nervosa non grata</i>.

16:53.900 --> 16:57.200
I had no place else to go.
-Would you like your usual?

16:57.400 --> 16:59.800
More than you could possibly know.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
This is a song I wrote 
about doing the right thing.

17:03.200 --> 17:07.400
Oh, lord, I'm gonna need that to go.
-<i>I think we always know 
in our hearts</i>,

17:07.599 --> 17:11.300
what the right thing is, 
but we don't always have the courage 
to do it.

17:11.500 --> 17:13.700
In my case, I knew this guy,

17:13.900 --> 17:16.000
that was playin' around with a woman.

17:16.200 --> 17:19.500
But what she didn't know was, 
he already had a girlfriend.

17:20.500 --> 17:23.200
Anyway, I was the only one 
who knew the facts,

17:23.400 --> 17:27.000
but what was I to do?  
Tell the guy to back off?

17:27.400 --> 17:30.000
Tell the girl that she was 
dating a sleaze?

17:30.200 --> 17:33.000
So I thought, and I thought...

17:33.200 --> 17:35.600
and here's what I done. 

17:36.900 --> 17:40.100
Oh, what a drag, I broke a string.  
Anyway, I'll be back in a mo'.

17:42.400 --> 17:45.400
Excuse me, excuse me.
-What? 
-What happened?

17:45.900 --> 17:49.700
What?  -In the song, 
what happened?  -I have to think 
all the way through it.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.500
Uh, "I knew a guy who had 
the wandering eye..."
-Yes, we know that part. What next?

17:54.700 --> 17:57.900
"He met a lady, he told her a lie..."
-Right, and then? 
-Chorus.

17:58.700 --> 18:01.000
Repeat chorus.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.700
Yes, yes, but the end.  
How did it end?

18:03.900 --> 18:07.300
"San Antonia Blues!"

18:15.600 --> 18:17.300
I said I'm coming!

18:17.500 --> 18:20.400
Frasier.  What can I do for you?
-Avery, we need to talk.

18:20.600 --> 18:25.000
I'm a little busy at the moment. 
-I'm sorry, it can't wait. I know 
about you and Julia Wilcox.

18:25.150 --> 18:28.450
I have no idea what you're...
-Oh, stop that!  You are 
a married man.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.300
I realize this may be fun and games 
to you, but she could get hurt.

18:31.500 --> 18:36.400
This is really not a good time.
-And why the hell not? 
-<i>Because I'm in the closet!</i>

18:45.200 --> 18:48.300
I had no idea.  I didn't mean 
for you to overhear...
-What?

18:48.500 --> 18:51.300
That Avery is married?  
I already know.

18:51.500 --> 18:54.500
You do?
-We're having an affair, you idiot.

18:59.600 --> 19:02.000
Well, I'm sorry.

19:02.300 --> 19:05.900
I thought I was helping you.
-Are you finished helping yet? 
-Yes, as a matter of fact I am.

19:06.050 --> 19:09.150
I'm also finished thinking that 
you and I owe each other the loyalty

19:09.300 --> 19:12.700
of professional kinship.  
From this day forward we are 
merely coworkers, cut and dry.

19:12.850 --> 19:17.050
And as for you, 
I am deducting my mileage here

19:17.200 --> 19:19.400
as a business expense.

19:23.300 --> 19:25.200
Unbelievable.

19:26.100 --> 19:30.100
Are you all right? 
-Yeah, yeah. He was just trying 
to help,

19:30.300 --> 19:33.500
...in his own heavy-handed way.

19:34.100 --> 19:36.900
He was always trying to be 
the hero.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.600
You know, one night back at Oxford, 
he crawled out onto a ledge

19:41.800 --> 19:45.500
to rescue what turned out 
to be a gargoyle.

19:51.700 --> 19:54.000
Ah, it's my wife.  
Excuse me.

19:54.900 --> 19:57.100
Hello?.. 
Hello, darling.

19:57.800 --> 20:00.000
Well, I miss you too.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.600
...Ah, not long.

20:09.100 --> 20:13.100
When does the alleged music start?
-It doesn't.  Ben quit.

20:13.400 --> 20:16.100
Really?  Why?
-Ask him yourself.

20:18.400 --> 20:19.900
Well, well.

20:20.200 --> 20:23.400
That's quite a sharp looking 
three-piece cage. What happened?

20:23.600 --> 20:27.600
Well you know, I don't really know. 
Some little blonde doxy came in here

20:27.800 --> 20:30.300
and hooked me up with a job 
at the Pelham Bay Bank.

20:30.450 --> 20:32.750
Have you got my check, old man?
-In the back.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.400
Do you want that for here or to go?
-For here.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.400
I'm staying.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.800
Congratulations, Frasier.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.600
You got your cafe back.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.400
Whatever.

20:49.300 --> 20:51.300
Say, Julia, wait.

20:52.300 --> 20:55.200
Didn't you used to be on the board 
of the Pelham Bay Bank?

20:56.200 --> 20:59.300
You want to know my bio?
