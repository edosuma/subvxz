00:34.599 --> 00:36.949
- People often
romanticize time travel.

00:38.821 --> 00:40.910
To get a second
chance seems so easy.

01:18.730 --> 01:20.993
- I need your help, please.

01:29.263 --> 01:31.371
Forgive me Samantha.

02:22.403 --> 02:24.709
- Maya Eckels!

02:32.804 --> 02:35.174
- Curfew is now in effect.

02:35.198 --> 02:37.896
Please return to
your dormitories.

02:44.990 --> 02:47.143
Curfew is now in effect.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.778
Please return to
your dormitories.

03:22.941 --> 03:26.467
- Please, you gotta help me.

03:44.528 --> 03:46.095
- Just take a deep breath.

03:47.444 --> 03:50.447
It's going to be
okay, I promise.

04:10.815 --> 04:11.815
- Excuse us.

04:15.385 --> 04:17.039
- Of course.

04:25.372 --> 04:26.372
- Who are you?

04:26.396 --> 04:27.591
- Hello, Maya.

04:27.615 --> 04:29.375
I'm here to investigate
the incident tonight.

04:31.532 --> 04:32.944
- You're with the police?

04:32.968 --> 04:35.362
- Ah, no, this situation
will be handled internally.

04:39.496 --> 04:42.040
- A murderer breaks into my
building and tries to kill me,

04:42.064 --> 04:45.435
only to be shot dead on my
doorstep and no police?

04:45.459 --> 04:46.871
- Oh, well that's
not true at all.

04:46.895 --> 04:49.482
The man that attacked
you is not dead.

04:49.506 --> 04:51.484
- What are you talking about?

04:51.508 --> 04:53.181
- It's been an eventful night.

04:53.205 --> 04:54.661
You must be mistaken.

04:54.685 --> 04:56.141
I just came from the hospital,

04:56.165 --> 04:57.732
and the doctors have
stabilized him.

04:59.037 --> 05:00.909
He will be arrested once
he has been released.

05:02.737 --> 05:05.324
Now, I'm going to need to
ask you some questions,

05:05.348 --> 05:07.002
and I need you to
be honest with me.

05:08.482 --> 05:10.416
I am here to figure out
why this has happened

05:10.440 --> 05:11.939
and secure your safety

05:11.963 --> 05:14.812
and the safety of everyone
at this facility.

05:14.836 --> 05:15.836
Understand?

05:19.797 --> 05:23.560
Question, have you seen
this man before today?

05:23.584 --> 05:24.584
- Samantha!

05:26.195 --> 05:27.195
- No.

05:29.981 --> 05:30.981
- Good.

05:33.463 --> 05:35.944
Second question, what
did he say to you?

05:39.469 --> 05:40.992
- Who said he said
anything to me?

05:43.299 --> 05:47.584
- Let's make one thing
perfectly clear.

05:47.608 --> 05:50.456
I know everything
about this place.

05:50.480 --> 05:54.702
Every crack, every secret.

05:57.008 --> 06:01.598
Now, I am here looking out for
everyone's best interest,

06:01.622 --> 06:04.494
so you would do well not
to lie to me again.

06:06.496 --> 06:10.544
What did this man say to you
before my team saved your life?

06:22.251 --> 06:23.251
Let's go.

07:59.522 --> 08:01.674
- What are you doing here?

08:01.698 --> 08:03.415
- Get this thing off of me!

08:03.439 --> 08:05.223
Get it off, get it off!

08:28.986 --> 08:31.399
- You can't just
show up like this.

08:31.423 --> 08:33.793
- I know I just really
need your help.

08:33.817 --> 08:36.927
- This is how we get caught,
you're too impulsive.

08:36.951 --> 08:39.344
- Says the guy who's asking
me to steal for him?

08:41.303 --> 08:43.784
Besides, when I tell you
what happened to me tonight.

08:46.787 --> 08:48.765
Just give me two minutes.

08:48.789 --> 08:50.149
I promise you'll
want to hear this.

08:52.575 --> 08:55.032
- Two minutes and you're gone.

09:57.901 --> 10:00.706
- Certainly your records
have been doctored.

10:00.730 --> 10:03.666
- Do you see the name
Samantha anywhere?

10:03.690 --> 10:07.800
- Just once, Samantha Reed
born October 15th, 2015

10:07.824 --> 10:11.021
at 12:03am, Denver, Colorado.

10:11.045 --> 10:12.568
And that's as far as they got.

10:14.570 --> 10:16.766
Must have been an auto
save file they missed

10:16.790 --> 10:17.921
when they wiped the records.

10:20.663 --> 10:21.838
- My name's Samantha?

10:23.884 --> 10:26.626
Does it say anything about
how I got to St. George's?

10:28.497 --> 10:32.042
- There's definitely a gap
in your geneline though.

10:32.066 --> 10:34.044
No mother on record.

10:34.068 --> 10:36.157
This could be your father.

10:39.116 --> 10:40.116
Wait.

10:41.684 --> 10:43.164
- That's the guy.

11:40.525 --> 11:42.702
- Hey, what's up stumbles?

11:47.837 --> 11:49.685
- Have we met?

11:49.709 --> 11:50.709
- Are you kidding?

11:51.798 --> 11:54.670
We hung out all day, you
still owe me money too.

11:57.368 --> 11:59.042
So since you're still here

11:59.066 --> 12:00.706
I'm assuming the surprise
visit went well?

12:04.201 --> 12:05.831
- What?

12:05.855 --> 12:06.855
- With your dad?

12:08.989 --> 12:09.989
- You mean Barry?

12:11.643 --> 12:12.643
- Who?

12:13.820 --> 12:14.820
- Montgomery.

12:16.344 --> 12:18.302
- Yeah, it went well?

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
- Yeah, I guess.

12:22.045 --> 12:23.457
Where does he live?

12:23.481 --> 12:24.961
- So you're clumsy
and forgetful now.

12:26.876 --> 12:29.226
- Would you just tell me
where he lives please?

12:31.881 --> 12:34.686
- Yeah, alright, it's
around the corner.

12:34.710 --> 12:36.103
Last house on the hill.

12:38.845 --> 12:39.845
- Thanks.

13:37.729 --> 13:38.968
- What?

13:38.992 --> 13:40.404
Who do you work for?

13:40.428 --> 13:41.821
- I don't work for...

13:43.170 --> 13:45.713
- Took you long
enough to find me!

13:45.737 --> 13:46.932
- What?

13:46.956 --> 13:48.556
- You can tell them
this is the last time

13:48.580 --> 13:49.900
you will be able
to track me down.

13:50.655 --> 13:52.255
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

13:52.279 --> 13:55.680
I just, I want to talk
to you for a moment.

13:55.704 --> 13:58.794
It's about the resistance.

14:00.578 --> 14:01.579
- Ah, the resistance.

14:08.238 --> 14:11.000
I knew it, get out of my way!

14:11.024 --> 14:13.959
- No wait, wait, wait, wait.

14:13.983 --> 14:14.983
Please.

14:15.985 --> 14:17.247
Come on, come on.

14:20.555 --> 14:21.555
Come on!

14:24.080 --> 14:25.536
I'm not moving until
you talk to me.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.016
- I will run you over!

14:27.040 --> 14:28.606
- I know your real
name is Barry Reed!

14:35.439 --> 14:36.439
- Gotcha.

14:38.094 --> 14:39.811
Ah, dammit.

14:39.835 --> 14:40.594
- What happened?

14:40.618 --> 14:41.813
- Fail safe.

14:41.837 --> 14:43.099
They're watching these files.

14:44.231 --> 14:45.231
- Who are they?

14:49.018 --> 14:50.018
Was that my father?

14:53.849 --> 14:55.348
What the hell is going on?

14:55.372 --> 14:56.372
- CID.

14:57.592 --> 14:58.592
- What?

15:01.465 --> 15:02.684
Tell me what's going on.

15:05.078 --> 15:09.319
- Okay, this isn't
really an orphanage.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.538
It's a facade, a fake.

15:11.562 --> 15:14.890
A better word to describe
it would be a farm.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.326
- A farm?

15:16.350 --> 15:18.981
- This whole place is owned,
operated, and populated

15:19.005 --> 15:22.636
by a secret branch of the Majora
Corporation called C.I.D.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.900
Now, CID is in charge
of the regulation

15:24.924 --> 15:27.752
and control of time travel.

15:37.545 --> 15:40.002
- So, you're telling me
there's a secret organization

15:40.026 --> 15:42.395
of time cops who are
policing time travel?

15:42.419 --> 15:44.180
- CID is afraid of
what might happen

15:44.204 --> 15:47.400
if somebody changes the
past, so they police it.

15:47.424 --> 15:52.212
Everybody in this place is here
because CID put them here.

15:55.171 --> 16:00.979
- So, my parents they
were killed by CID?

16:01.003 --> 16:02.203
- At least your father wasn't.

16:03.223 --> 16:05.462
CID doesn't generally kill.

16:05.486 --> 16:07.681
They sort of reconstitute.

16:07.705 --> 16:10.249
Wipe your memories and
replace them with new ones

16:10.273 --> 16:13.513
or send you to a research
facility in the middle of nowhere

16:13.537 --> 16:15.472
until they can figure out
what to do with you.

16:15.496 --> 16:19.650
- So, you're saying that
CID was behind my father

16:19.674 --> 16:21.328
trying to assassinate
me tonight.

16:22.503 --> 16:24.002
- Likely, yes.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.699
- And you didn't tell
me this because?

16:25.723 --> 16:28.267
- Because it's not
for you to know.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.380
It's not for anyone to know.

16:34.080 --> 16:38.234
- So, we're all just part
of some stupid experiment!

16:38.258 --> 16:39.955
Chaos theory is just a theory.

16:41.261 --> 16:44.109
- Look, this is a lot
bigger than just you.

16:44.133 --> 16:45.526
Just forget about it.

16:58.234 --> 16:59.496
- Are you okay?

17:00.323 --> 17:02.475
What the hell?

17:02.499 --> 17:04.128
- This girl was harassing me

17:04.153 --> 17:05.782
and trespassing on my
property, alright?

17:05.807 --> 17:06.566
- She was harassing you, huh?

17:06.589 --> 17:07.589
Stay right there honey.

17:08.592 --> 17:10.701
I saw the whole thing,
I'm calling my sheriff.

17:10.724 --> 17:12.074
- No, no, don't do that.

17:13.205 --> 17:15.053
- This is bullshit, alright!

17:15.077 --> 17:16.489
She ran right out
in front of me.

17:16.512 --> 17:19.579
This is a crock of shit, you're
an idiot, you know that?

17:19.603 --> 17:22.278
She's trespassing,
and I get arrested?

17:22.301 --> 17:23.477
This is bullshit!

17:32.790 --> 17:34.749
- You sure you don't
want to press charges?

17:36.098 --> 17:38.555
- No, it was just a
misunderstanding.

17:38.579 --> 17:39.579
Please don't do that.

17:40.755 --> 17:42.863
- Well, to tell you the
truth, this is not

17:42.887 --> 17:44.287
the first run in
we've had with him.

17:44.933 --> 17:47.520
We're gonna hold onto
him for a while.

17:47.544 --> 17:49.305
At least until he cools off.

17:49.329 --> 17:51.244
Get home safe miss.

17:56.205 --> 17:58.618
She's not gonna press charges.

17:58.642 --> 18:00.533
We'll just hold him
for the night.

18:24.146 --> 18:26.733
- Chaos theory says that if
I were to go back in time

18:26.757 --> 18:28.257
and step on a butterfly

18:28.281 --> 18:30.239
the whole world could
explode or whatever.

18:32.328 --> 18:35.438
But The Novikov
self-consistency principle says

18:35.462 --> 18:38.334
that whatever you do in the
past, you've already done.

18:41.424 --> 18:43.252
But how could CID
know which is right?

18:45.124 --> 18:47.169
- You've been studying
the material I see.

18:49.519 --> 18:51.149
- So, they must be
using the Eloi Gas

18:51.173 --> 18:53.132
as some type of
molecule accelerator.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.533
You're building a time machine.

19:06.362 --> 19:10.255
- And this is why you
shouldn't know these things.

19:10.279 --> 19:11.387
You're too damn smart.

19:11.411 --> 19:12.823
- That's it.

19:12.847 --> 19:14.390
You can send me back in time,
and I can find my parents

19:14.414 --> 19:16.218
and figure out why I'm
in this shit hole.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.263
- No, we're not doing that.

19:18.287 --> 19:19.567
- So, you do have
a time machine?

19:19.591 --> 19:21.223
- It doesn't matter.

19:21.247 --> 19:24.443
Even if we could safely land you
in the past, to what point?

19:24.467 --> 19:26.663
We have nothing to go on.

19:26.687 --> 19:28.795
And this whole situation
has escalated

19:28.819 --> 19:30.362
because of your father.

19:30.386 --> 19:32.103
- The man who tried
to kill me tonight.

19:32.127 --> 19:33.127
- Yes.

19:34.825 --> 19:38.936
Barry Reed is a very famous
man in some circles.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.025
He used to work for CID.

19:41.049 --> 19:43.419
He figured out what they were
doing and started the movement

19:43.443 --> 19:47.336
against the organization
almost 20 years ago.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.773
He did amazing things
for the resistance.

19:49.797 --> 19:51.818
- So, what happened to him?

19:51.842 --> 19:54.018
- Gone, disappeared.

19:55.629 --> 19:56.629
Until tonight.

19:57.674 --> 19:59.870
- Well then, maybe you
could send me back,

19:59.894 --> 20:02.394
and I can figure out
why this happened.

20:02.418 --> 20:05.180
I can find him and maybe
warn him about the future,

20:05.204 --> 20:07.443
or maybe he knows
stuff about CID,

20:07.467 --> 20:09.053
and I can bring him back to you.

20:09.077 --> 20:09.967
- No, I can't!

20:09.991 --> 20:11.490
- Why can't you?

20:11.514 --> 20:13.100
- If you were to go back and
prevent him from attacking you

20:13.124 --> 20:15.102
tonight, then you never
would have ended up here.

20:15.126 --> 20:17.627
Anything you do will
create a paradox...

20:17.651 --> 20:19.194
- No, no, no, don't pull
that paradox crap with me.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.107
You're the one who showed me

20:20.131 --> 20:21.451
the many worlds
interpretation...

20:21.475 --> 20:22.632
- It's just a theory.

20:22.656 --> 20:24.155
- No, it's not just a theory.

20:24.179 --> 20:25.746
- The answer is no!

20:32.448 --> 20:33.448
You should go.

20:35.016 --> 20:36.776
They'll notice you went
blind any moment now.

20:42.850 --> 20:45.244
- Well, you could at least
show me how it works.

20:54.470 --> 20:59.258
- This is starting to become a
routine stop for you Eckels.

21:07.309 --> 21:08.808
- Curfew is now in effect.

21:08.832 --> 21:11.487
Please return to
your dormitories.

21:13.315 --> 21:14.553
- Help me.
- Forget about it.

21:14.577 --> 21:15.511
- Not dead.
- Time travel.

21:15.535 --> 21:18.209
- This man.
- Your father.

21:18.233 --> 21:19.993
- Forgive me.
- CID put them here.

21:20.017 --> 21:22.759
- Saved your life.
- The resistance.

21:55.444 --> 21:58.075
So, when the Eloi
gas is heated up,

21:58.099 --> 22:00.686
it accelerates the
surrounding molecules,

22:00.710 --> 22:02.732
which then in turn creates...

22:02.756 --> 22:04.192
- Micro black holes, I know.

22:05.454 --> 22:08.955
- So, I deconstruct the
subjects DNA, map it,

22:08.979 --> 22:11.393
and then reconstruct it on the
other side of the wormhole.

22:11.417 --> 22:13.525
- So, basically you
break down the person

22:13.549 --> 22:15.527
before the wormhole can.

22:15.551 --> 22:17.007
- Right.

22:17.031 --> 22:18.748
So, the rule is, if I
send someone back,

22:18.772 --> 22:21.316
their time moves in
unison with ours.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.340
Tick for tock.

22:23.298 --> 22:25.450
- So, how do you
choose where to go?

22:25.474 --> 22:26.799
- That's the easy part.

22:26.823 --> 22:28.521
Basic coordinates, and.

22:33.221 --> 22:34.546
- What is that?

22:34.570 --> 22:35.658
- This is the device.

22:39.923 --> 22:40.923
- It's a watch.

22:41.795 --> 22:43.274
- It's a lot more than that.

22:44.754 --> 22:45.754
I call it the VM.

22:46.756 --> 22:48.560
- That's the time machine?

22:48.584 --> 22:49.474
- Think of it more
like a remote.

22:49.498 --> 22:51.370
This controls the time machine.

22:56.462 --> 22:59.528
You squeeze these spikes as
hard as you can into your palm.

22:59.552 --> 23:01.791
The dial fills with blood,
and the device emits

23:01.815 --> 23:05.142
a short concussion blast that
temporarily stops your heart.

23:05.166 --> 23:07.274
That, along with the cold water,

23:07.298 --> 23:09.015
will help to prevent
any transmodification

23:09.039 --> 23:11.148
that might take place

23:11.172 --> 23:13.783
during the bi-temporal phylogenetic
reconstruction process.

23:15.698 --> 23:17.526
I don't know if any
of this works.

23:49.428 --> 23:52.581
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

23:52.605 --> 23:54.670
Did you even stop to think
about where you're going?

23:54.694 --> 23:56.541
What about how you're
going to get back, huh?

23:56.565 --> 23:59.631
What are you gonna do
if someone catches you?

23:59.655 --> 24:01.570
- I was just gonna
figure it out.

24:04.530 --> 24:06.314
I used the coordinates
from your map.

24:13.713 --> 24:14.713
John.

24:16.890 --> 24:17.890
I need this.

24:22.635 --> 24:23.810
I need to try.

24:26.726 --> 24:28.641
All I'm asking for is one day.

24:30.164 --> 24:31.992
Don't you want to see
if it works too?

24:39.042 --> 24:40.042
- One day.

24:41.871 --> 24:43.632
We can't risk having
somebody see you land,

24:43.656 --> 24:45.808
so I'm gonna put you down
right at the outskirts

24:45.832 --> 24:47.679
of the town he was last seen in.

24:47.703 --> 24:49.899
He's probably living
under an alias,

24:49.923 --> 24:52.839
so try Montgomery or Leonard.

24:55.798 --> 24:59.386
If you can't figure it out
in one day, that's it.

24:59.410 --> 25:02.520
You can't go skipping
around with this thing.

25:02.544 --> 25:04.653
Try to find out what you can,

25:04.677 --> 25:06.113
but don't tell him who you are.

25:09.986 --> 25:12.685
Try to make as little of
an impression as possible.

25:27.787 --> 25:30.026
They say Barry was
devising a plan.

25:30.050 --> 25:32.724
A plan that could cripple
CID's Infrastructure.

25:32.748 --> 25:36.032
But then something happened,
something went wrong.

25:36.056 --> 25:37.729
He never used them.

25:37.753 --> 25:40.732
Get me those plans,
bury it where you land

25:40.756 --> 25:42.647
and I'll dig them up
on the other side.

25:42.671 --> 25:44.891
We can finish what he started.

25:49.373 --> 25:51.482
- We got another one?

25:51.506 --> 25:52.701
- Find me that location.

25:52.725 --> 25:53.725
- Narrowing it down now.

26:00.689 --> 26:02.188
Good news.

26:02.212 --> 26:03.146
- Where is it?

26:03.170 --> 26:06.695
- It's coming from St. George.

27:07.234 --> 27:09.584
- You've met with a
terrible fate, haven't you?

27:12.543 --> 27:15.372
I'm just kidding, I
saw what happened.

27:18.288 --> 27:19.986
You want to talk about it?

27:22.379 --> 27:23.379
- No.

27:26.688 --> 27:28.231
- Well, at least it looks like

27:28.255 --> 27:29.822
you're feeling a little better.

27:31.911 --> 27:33.192
- What?

27:33.216 --> 27:34.827
- Your hand, it's better.

27:37.177 --> 27:38.700
- No it still hurts.

27:39.701 --> 27:41.355
- Yeah, well, the other one is.

27:44.097 --> 27:47.642
- Okay, I don't know what
you're talking about.

27:47.666 --> 27:48.786
Can you just leave me alone?

27:48.810 --> 27:51.726
- Alright, seriously,
what's going on?

27:55.891 --> 27:57.216
- I gotta go.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.000
- Okay, whatever the
joke is, I don't get it.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.723
- Just leave me alone, okay.

29:11.924 --> 29:15.555
- You can't figure it out
in a day, that's it.

29:15.579 --> 29:18.713
You can't go skipping
around with this thing.

31:52.693 --> 31:55.454
- How's the tricks, Angie?

31:55.478 --> 31:56.758
- Where did you send them, John?

31:59.068 --> 32:00.068
- He talk?

32:00.092 --> 32:01.460
- Not a word.

32:01.484 --> 32:03.114
- Well, good news.

32:03.138 --> 32:04.942
We've got a target date.

32:04.966 --> 32:07.379
But there's no telling how
accurate his machine was.

32:07.403 --> 32:08.772
Especially if he
was really using

32:08.796 --> 32:10.078
a bathtub as an insulator.

32:10.102 --> 32:11.035
- It was accurate.

32:11.059 --> 32:12.297
Tell me where they went.

32:12.321 --> 32:14.628
- Vista, Colorado, 16 years ago.

32:16.021 --> 32:18.153
- Get your team
ready, we jump soon.

34:39.947 --> 34:40.947
- Daddy hi!

34:45.909 --> 34:48.434
Hi there, I am your daughter.

35:07.017 --> 35:08.017
Excuse me.

35:11.021 --> 35:12.608
Hello?

35:12.632 --> 35:14.784
Hey can I talk to one of you?

35:14.808 --> 35:16.351
- Hey, what can I help you with?

35:16.375 --> 35:18.072
- Ah, I'm sorry, not you, you.

35:18.942 --> 35:20.833
- Hey, what's going on?

35:20.857 --> 35:24.034
- Can I talk to you
for a sec, alone?

35:26.211 --> 35:28.102
- Sure how about over here?

35:28.126 --> 35:29.668
- I don't know why I'm here.

35:29.692 --> 35:32.304
I just, I saw you and...

35:34.393 --> 35:36.327
Do we know each other?

35:36.351 --> 35:37.351
- I guess we do now.

35:38.397 --> 35:40.288
First up, my name's Tyler.

35:40.312 --> 35:41.419
And yours is?

35:41.443 --> 35:42.443
- Ah, I'm Maya.

35:44.838 --> 35:45.838
- Maya, nice to meet you.

35:47.275 --> 35:49.973
So, is there something
I can do for you?

35:51.366 --> 35:52.865
- No I'm from out of town.

35:52.889 --> 35:55.216
- Oh, cool.

35:55.240 --> 35:58.044
Well, I can be your ambassador
to the wonderful town

35:58.068 --> 36:01.289
of Vista, Colorado,
population not very many.

36:02.595 --> 36:03.639
What brings you here?

36:04.553 --> 36:06.575
- I'm visiting someone.

36:06.599 --> 36:08.054
Family, I guess.

36:08.078 --> 36:10.255
I mean, I was visiting him.

36:11.386 --> 36:12.407
- Who?

36:12.431 --> 36:13.431
- Barry?

36:14.998 --> 36:16.324
- I don't know a Barry.

36:16.348 --> 36:18.437
- Oh, he also goes
by Montgomery.

36:20.656 --> 36:21.656
- Oh, that guy.

36:22.374 --> 36:23.374
- You know him?

36:23.398 --> 36:25.202
- Not really.

36:25.226 --> 36:28.292
Mostly keeps to himself, not
too active around here.

36:28.316 --> 36:30.512
You're related how?

36:30.536 --> 36:31.536
- He's my dad.

36:32.494 --> 36:34.453
But, I don't think he
wants to know, so.

36:36.150 --> 36:38.520
- Since you're here today,
you wanna hang out?

36:38.544 --> 36:40.522
We can help you take
your mind off things.

36:40.546 --> 36:42.243
- No, sorry I don't have time.

36:44.898 --> 36:45.898
- Ah, come on.

36:52.166 --> 36:55.038
- Oh, I just hurt my
hands when I was...

36:57.127 --> 36:58.453
- No need to explain.

36:58.477 --> 37:01.369
Some people are just clumsier
than others I guess.

37:01.393 --> 37:02.761
- I'm not clumsy.

37:02.785 --> 37:05.242
- I'm not judging, can
I call you stumbles?

37:05.266 --> 37:06.398
Hey, what's up stumbles?

37:07.442 --> 37:08.443
- Shut up.

37:10.489 --> 37:11.489
- Come on.

37:13.318 --> 37:15.165
It's not just them.

37:15.189 --> 37:16.862
There's some girls coming too.

37:16.886 --> 37:18.166
I'll introduce you to everybody.

37:19.411 --> 37:21.215
- I don't know.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.110
- Hey, come on, I
promise, it'll be fun.

37:28.420 --> 37:29.769
- I guess I could use a break.

37:37.667 --> 37:38.667
- Hey there.

37:38.691 --> 37:39.779
- Tyler, I need your help.

38:13.203 --> 38:15.791
- But after that it
was, like constant.

38:15.815 --> 38:17.009
- What's up guys?

38:17.033 --> 38:19.079
This is Maya, she's new in town.

38:25.564 --> 38:27.455
- What's going on?

38:27.479 --> 38:28.238
- It's a race to the top.

38:28.262 --> 38:29.307
Loser fetches the booze.

38:30.569 --> 38:31.894
- What?

38:31.918 --> 38:33.983
- Straight to the top,
just stick with me.

38:34.007 --> 38:36.052
- Alright, is everybody ready?

38:37.204 --> 38:38.204
You ready?

38:38.228 --> 38:40.883
On your marks, get set...

38:44.191 --> 38:45.908
- Unit 2, report.

38:45.932 --> 38:47.605
Potential target has
been identified.

38:47.629 --> 38:48.629
- Set!
- Hey!

38:50.850 --> 38:53.069
- Location, north of
town, Glacier lake.

38:58.988 --> 39:00.947
- Think you can keep up?

39:28.844 --> 39:31.040
- I guess I win.

39:31.064 --> 39:33.085
- Everybody, this is Maya.

39:33.109 --> 39:36.611
- What can I say, I'm more
of a lover than a fighter.

39:36.635 --> 39:37.635
- Yeah, right.

39:38.332 --> 39:40.049
- How do you cheat and lose?

39:40.073 --> 39:40.876
You definitely fetch...

39:40.900 --> 39:42.617
- No, I did last time.

39:42.641 --> 39:43.792
- And you'll go again.

39:43.816 --> 39:45.446
- No, screw that.

39:45.470 --> 39:46.360
Make the new girl do it.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.839
- No guys, c'mon.

39:47.863 --> 39:49.450
- Yeah, why not?

39:49.474 --> 39:50.668
Let's see what she's got.

39:50.692 --> 39:53.279
- I just, I don't know.
- No, I'll do it.

39:53.303 --> 39:55.523
- See there ya go, perfect!

39:56.829 --> 39:58.546
- What is it?

39:58.570 --> 40:01.113
- It's this place
we stash our shit.

40:01.137 --> 40:02.637
The alcohol.

40:02.661 --> 40:05.727
It's an old purple suitcase
about 100 yards that way.

40:05.751 --> 40:07.468
- Okay, what's the big deal?

40:07.492 --> 40:10.166
- Awhile back, a group of
kids went missing in there.

40:10.190 --> 40:12.647
Some people think it's
haunted or something.

40:12.671 --> 40:15.040
- It's ghosts, man.
- Shut up, Dylan.

40:15.064 --> 40:18.546
- No, I'm serious, I've seen it.

40:22.071 --> 40:23.875
- You know, I'm not scared.

40:23.899 --> 40:24.899
How do I get there?

40:27.903 --> 40:29.794
What's this for?

40:29.818 --> 40:31.037
- It's for the bears.

40:32.995 --> 40:35.670
- Okay, which way is it again?

40:35.694 --> 40:37.435
- It shouldn't be
that hard to find.

40:38.914 --> 40:41.415
Underneath the fallen tree,
should spot it right away.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.547
So, ah, grab as much
back as you can,

40:43.571 --> 40:45.549
after that make sure
to cover it back up.

40:45.573 --> 40:47.769
The rule is, we have
to wait 10 minutes

40:47.793 --> 40:50.033
until we can come get you, but
we'll have someone waiting

40:50.057 --> 40:51.990
right at the tree line
in case you need help.

40:52.014 --> 40:54.539
Just give us a holler out
and we'll be right there.

40:56.410 --> 41:00.085
Listen, if you don't want to
do this, you don't have to.

41:00.109 --> 41:01.109
- See ya soon.

41:22.523 --> 41:24.003
Okay, not so bad.

41:33.142 --> 41:34.468
- You okay?

41:34.492 --> 41:35.536
- I'm just fine!

41:53.728 --> 41:56.078
- Eyes on target,
do I make a move?

41:57.602 --> 41:59.517
- Do not engage.

42:52.178 --> 42:54.460
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

42:54.484 --> 42:55.484
What are you doing?

42:56.443 --> 42:57.792
- I saw someone.

42:59.664 --> 43:00.858
- What?

43:00.882 --> 43:01.882
- Someone is here.

43:02.841 --> 43:04.190
- What are you talking about?

43:10.370 --> 43:11.956
- What are you doing here?

43:11.980 --> 43:13.697
- I heard a loud bang.

43:13.721 --> 43:16.047
I just wanted to make
sure you were okay.

43:16.071 --> 43:17.832
- I had things under control.

43:17.856 --> 43:18.856
- Clearly.

43:20.772 --> 43:22.663
Look, everything's fine.

43:22.687 --> 43:24.708
There's no one here,
it was a joke.

43:24.732 --> 43:26.038
We were just messin' with you.

43:28.214 --> 43:29.389
At least you found it okay.

43:31.434 --> 43:33.108
You let Dylan scare you.

43:33.132 --> 43:34.132
- No, I saw someone.

43:35.743 --> 43:38.093
- Alright, help me grab these.

43:43.969 --> 43:44.969
- Did you see him?

43:45.710 --> 43:47.973
- No, Dylan, is that you?

43:50.323 --> 43:52.214
Stop messin' around, man.

43:52.238 --> 43:53.631
- It's not Dylan.

43:57.852 --> 44:00.028
- Let's just get out of here.

44:09.472 --> 44:11.842
- I told you someone was there.

44:11.866 --> 44:12.800
You were scared, huh?

44:12.824 --> 44:13.975
- No, I was protecting you.

44:13.999 --> 44:15.759
- Oh my god, the new
girl made it back alive!

44:17.306 --> 44:18.457
Did you see any ghosts?

44:18.481 --> 44:19.787
- Nah, it was easy.

44:24.923 --> 44:25.923
- So?

44:27.142 --> 44:29.101
- The one in the middle.

44:34.759 --> 44:37.041
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

44:37.065 --> 44:38.153
- Notice what?

44:39.851 --> 44:41.896
- It's the same girl from St.
George's.

44:43.506 --> 44:44.506
- Yes.

44:47.728 --> 44:50.011
- Why not give us
that information?

44:50.035 --> 44:52.428
- Because that information
is above your rank.

44:54.953 --> 44:59.542
- Fine, this is a good
place to take her.

44:59.566 --> 45:00.766
Are we ready to make our move?

45:03.570 --> 45:04.570
- No.

45:05.790 --> 45:06.790
We wait.

45:18.367 --> 45:20.519
- You okay over there?

45:20.543 --> 45:24.112
- Yeah, I've never had
that much fun before.

45:25.897 --> 45:27.570
I like your friends.

45:27.594 --> 45:29.267
- They like you too.

45:29.291 --> 45:30.423
They loved you actually.

45:31.990 --> 45:32.990
- It's like a family.

45:34.122 --> 45:35.122
- Yeah, it is.

45:36.298 --> 45:37.386
So, when do you leave?

45:39.519 --> 45:40.519
- Hey, wait, stop!

45:41.913 --> 45:44.219
Can I, maybe, borrow $20?

45:48.441 --> 45:49.921
- Ah, yeah, sure.

45:54.360 --> 45:55.360
- Thanks.

46:00.018 --> 46:03.475
- So, why can't you tell
me where we're going?

46:03.499 --> 46:05.260
- It's just something
I have to do okay?

46:05.284 --> 46:06.740
- Okay, but why?

46:06.764 --> 46:10.550
- Because I kind of already did.

46:12.117 --> 46:14.791
- Anybody ever tell you you're
kind of a strange girl?

46:14.815 --> 46:15.815
- Okay, here it is.

46:16.730 --> 46:18.036
Here, quick, give me the shoes.

46:21.604 --> 46:22.692
Okay, that's it.

46:24.236 --> 46:25.236
- You're just gonna
leave this all here,

46:25.260 --> 46:26.934
and I paid good money for this?

46:26.958 --> 46:27.958
- I know, it's weird.

46:29.003 --> 46:30.372
I'll make it up to you, okay?

46:30.396 --> 46:31.396
I promise.

46:35.270 --> 46:37.229
- Yeah, it's right here.

46:42.843 --> 46:44.889
- Come on, I'll walk
you to the door.

46:52.897 --> 46:55.136
- Wait, this isn't right.

46:55.160 --> 46:56.160
He didn't know me.

47:15.528 --> 47:16.572
I need to get inside.

47:17.617 --> 47:19.595
- Well, ya know most people

47:19.619 --> 47:21.059
would just knock in
this situation...

47:21.083 --> 47:21.945
- I can't.

47:21.969 --> 47:23.860
I have to get in
without him seeing me.

47:23.884 --> 47:25.514
- You wanna break in?

47:25.538 --> 47:27.801
- It's not breaking
in, he's family.

47:29.281 --> 47:31.955
I need to know more about him
before I can approach him.

47:31.979 --> 47:33.419
- I don't think
breaking and entering

47:33.443 --> 47:34.958
will make the best impression.

47:34.982 --> 47:37.047
- Please are you gonna
help me or not?

47:37.071 --> 47:39.378
- That guy's crazy,
I'm thinking not.

47:40.727 --> 47:42.903
- Don't be scared, just help me.

47:45.297 --> 47:47.081
- Have a good night.

49:19.043 --> 49:20.368
- You hear that?

49:20.392 --> 49:23.873
There's no way out
now, I will find you.

49:29.879 --> 49:31.316
You listening, huh?

49:43.197 --> 49:45.697
You god damn bastards,
leave us out of this!

51:35.135 --> 51:36.136
What?

51:38.312 --> 51:39.313
Bullshit!

52:04.121 --> 52:05.121
- Hello?

53:30.119 --> 53:31.556
- Samantha!

53:46.048 --> 53:47.048
- 87?

53:55.580 --> 53:57.190
What is this junk?

53:59.366 --> 54:00.366
Dammit!

54:09.768 --> 54:11.117
- Give the order, Angelica!

54:12.379 --> 54:15.513
If she gets away, we
can't let that happen.

54:17.645 --> 54:21.432
When they ask, this
will be in my report.

54:25.740 --> 54:27.979
Fine, I'll go get her myself.

54:28.003 --> 54:29.633
- Just stop!

54:29.657 --> 54:31.572
Just stop for one
second, please.

54:34.662 --> 54:35.881
- Angie what's going on?

54:41.495 --> 54:42.820
Angie?

54:42.844 --> 54:43.844
- I don't know!

54:45.673 --> 54:48.565
There's something
different about this op.

54:48.589 --> 54:50.678
This whole thing, it
doesn't feel right.

54:53.507 --> 54:54.507
What are we doing here?

54:56.902 --> 54:58.251
This girl had a family.

55:00.732 --> 55:02.211
She was just trying
to find them.

55:05.258 --> 55:07.889
How do we know what we're
doing is even right?

55:07.913 --> 55:10.500
I mean, what if CID is wrong
about this whole thing?

55:10.524 --> 55:13.634
- Do you really think what
we've been doing is wrong?

55:13.658 --> 55:14.722
We're not the bad guys.

55:14.746 --> 55:15.746
- We're not?

55:19.054 --> 55:21.361
How do you know they
haven't done this to you?

55:27.498 --> 55:28.498
Listen.

55:33.765 --> 55:37.812
What if we just, what if
we just let this one go?

55:42.556 --> 55:45.516
CID will do anything
to stop Colliders.

55:47.431 --> 55:48.432
But should we?

55:54.873 --> 55:55.993
- You should get some sleep.

55:56.017 --> 55:57.584
- I need to figure this out.

55:59.530 --> 56:01.595
I just need a little more time.

56:01.619 --> 56:03.379
- It's too risky.

56:03.403 --> 56:08.277
If CID finds out, look, I don't
want to lose you over this.

56:09.931 --> 56:12.369
It's time, we take the girl now.

56:14.109 --> 56:15.109
- One more day.

56:20.333 --> 56:22.117
I won't let anything
get out of hand.

56:25.251 --> 56:26.251
Leo, please.

56:31.213 --> 56:33.041
Everything will be fine.

56:36.088 --> 56:37.088
Trust me.

57:08.250 --> 57:10.165
- What?
- What the hell?

58:33.988 --> 58:35.357
Wait, please!

58:35.381 --> 58:36.924
Just talk to me for
a second, okay?

58:36.948 --> 58:38.316
I'm not here to hurt you.

58:38.340 --> 58:41.232
- Said the girl with a
shotgun pointed at me.

58:41.256 --> 58:43.234
- Will you just
talk to me, please?

58:43.258 --> 58:45.933
- There's nothing you could
say that I'd want to hear,

58:45.957 --> 58:47.597
so you've got about
five seconds before...

58:47.621 --> 58:49.327
- Your daughter was
born today at 12:03 AM!

58:49.351 --> 58:50.807
Her name is Samantha...

58:50.831 --> 58:51.831
- Okay, okay.

58:56.184 --> 58:57.185
I'll listen to you.

59:03.148 --> 59:05.106
I will fucking kill you.

59:06.412 --> 59:08.457
Don't say her name,
don't even think it.

59:09.894 --> 59:13.047
I will kill everyone of you
that tries to get to them.

59:13.071 --> 59:14.744
Do you hear me?

59:14.768 --> 59:17.088
With every breath in my body,
I will protect them from you.

59:17.112 --> 59:18.418
Do you hear me?

59:37.617 --> 59:38.617
Who are you?

59:41.882 --> 59:43.754
You work for CID, I know you do.

59:44.842 --> 59:45.962
You work for CID, don't you?

59:45.986 --> 59:47.429
I know you do.

59:47.453 --> 59:48.691
You work for CID.

59:48.715 --> 59:50.780
How do you know about
Samantha, tell me.

59:50.804 --> 59:52.434
- No, please.

59:52.458 --> 59:54.436
- Don't lie to me god dammit.

59:54.460 --> 59:55.460
- No, please.

59:56.680 --> 59:57.681
I am Samantha.

01:00:03.904 --> 01:00:06.820
- What?

01:00:22.096 --> 01:00:25.447
- I am Samantha Reed,
your daughter.

01:00:27.014 --> 01:00:30.627
The child you abandon today,
grows up to turn into me.

01:00:36.284 --> 01:00:37.284
Why?

01:00:38.852 --> 01:00:41.918
Why couldn't you just
be there for me?

01:00:41.942 --> 01:00:44.007
They got me living
in some shit hole

01:00:44.031 --> 01:00:45.554
St. George's all my life.

01:00:47.948 --> 01:00:49.123
- How is that possible?

01:00:52.344 --> 01:00:53.737
- I know you worked for CID.

01:00:55.477 --> 01:00:57.915
So, when I say I came
back from the future,

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:02.659
to come and find you,
you know it's possible.

01:01:06.488 --> 01:01:09.666
- Samantha Reed is
my granddaughter.

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:16.629
My son, Roger had a
daughter last night.

01:01:20.764 --> 01:01:25.682
- Your son, his daughter's
name is Samantha?

01:01:31.513 --> 01:01:34.014
So that means, you're
my grandfather.

01:01:34.038 --> 01:01:38.651
- But if you're Samantha,
then why did you come here?

01:01:41.393 --> 01:01:43.177
- You came and tried...

01:01:46.441 --> 01:01:49.377
You were the most
recent family member

01:01:49.401 --> 01:01:51.795
attached to my records.

01:01:57.670 --> 01:02:00.954
- You.

01:02:00.978 --> 01:02:01.978
You're the Collider.

01:02:03.371 --> 01:02:04.371
God damn it.

01:02:05.069 --> 01:02:06.069
- Collider?

01:02:07.158 --> 01:02:09.005
Like my parents too, right?

01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:11.225
- Have you noticed
anyone following you?

01:02:11.249 --> 01:02:13.817
Anyone watching you
since you got here?

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:17.971
- I'm new to this town,
everyone looks at me funny.

01:02:18.778 --> 01:02:20.016
- Shit.

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.738
Come on, come on, come on.

01:02:23.087 --> 01:02:25.239
Don't ask questions,
just listen.

01:02:25.263 --> 01:02:27.284
These guys are snatchers.

01:02:27.308 --> 01:02:29.068
If they catch you, they
will wipe your memory

01:02:29.092 --> 01:02:30.940
and send you back to St.
George's.

01:02:30.964 --> 01:02:33.943
They're here to stop you
from changing your past.

01:02:33.967 --> 01:02:35.423
You should have never come here.

01:02:35.447 --> 01:02:36.946
You caused all of this.

01:02:36.970 --> 01:02:38.992
They're going to take
everyone because of you.

01:02:39.016 --> 01:02:41.297
Everyone you talked to, everyone
you came in contact with.

01:02:41.321 --> 01:02:44.040
They're gonna make it so
no one will ever know

01:02:44.064 --> 01:02:45.085
that you were even here.

01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:46.109
Take this.

01:02:46.937 --> 01:02:48.610
Get to them before CID does.

01:02:48.634 --> 01:02:50.351
I'll draw these guys away.

01:02:50.375 --> 01:02:52.527
Once I'm gone, you need to
find a way to warn them.

01:02:52.551 --> 01:02:53.833
Whatever it takes.

01:02:53.857 --> 01:02:55.989
You did this, so find
a way to fix it.

01:02:57.948 --> 01:02:58.948
Look.

01:03:01.734 --> 01:03:04.495
I didn't think I'd ever get
the chance to meet you.

01:03:04.519 --> 01:03:08.412
You are more beautiful than
I ever could have imagined.

01:03:08.436 --> 01:03:10.980
I was just trying
to protect you.

01:03:11.004 --> 01:03:12.005
Protect all of you.

01:03:22.973 --> 01:03:25.952
You want me, I'm right here!

01:03:25.976 --> 01:03:27.020
Come and get me!

01:03:41.948 --> 01:03:43.515
- Get that patched,
I got the girl.

01:03:57.355 --> 01:04:01.074
- Don't be scared,
it's like a family.

01:04:17.941 --> 01:04:19.179
- Hey there.

01:04:19.203 --> 01:04:21.007
- Tyler, I need your help.

01:04:21.031 --> 01:04:22.660
- Whoa, whoa, what's going on?

01:04:22.684 --> 01:04:23.924
- I don't have time to explain.

01:04:23.948 --> 01:04:25.308
I need you to drive
me to the city.

01:04:25.332 --> 01:04:26.099
- The city?

01:04:26.123 --> 01:04:27.100
It's getting kind of late.

01:04:27.124 --> 01:04:28.014
- I know, I know, Tyler.

01:04:28.038 --> 01:04:28.623
I just need your help, okay?

01:04:28.647 --> 01:04:29.647
- Alright, okay.

01:04:30.214 --> 01:04:31.278
Let me get a jacket.

01:04:31.302 --> 01:04:32.192
- We need to hurry.

01:04:32.216 --> 01:04:33.216
- Okay.

01:04:42.095 --> 01:04:43.095
- Yeah?

01:04:43.836 --> 01:04:44.987
- Sit-rep?

01:04:45.011 --> 01:04:46.012
- Ah, Leo's gone.

01:04:47.927 --> 01:04:49.668
He ran into the woods
after the girl.

01:04:52.149 --> 01:04:55.519
- Is that it?

01:04:55.543 --> 01:04:58.435
- And the old man got away.

01:04:58.459 --> 01:05:01.830
- The girl is on the move
with one of the locals.

01:05:01.854 --> 01:05:03.638
Come get me, we
need to stop her.

01:05:06.076 --> 01:05:07.077
- Copy.

01:05:17.522 --> 01:05:20.917
- Tyler, I'm sorry
about the other night.

01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:26.507
- Nah, ya know, it's alright.

01:05:26.531 --> 01:05:28.663
I know it's hard when
you're in a new place.

01:05:30.448 --> 01:05:34.060
So, will you please tell
me what's going on?

01:05:53.471 --> 01:05:56.909
I'm not going anywhere until
you tell me what's going on.

01:06:04.264 --> 01:06:05.264
Maya!

01:06:06.484 --> 01:06:08.070
- I don't know!

01:06:08.094 --> 01:06:09.094
I don't know, okay!

01:06:10.009 --> 01:06:11.228
I think I'm being followed.

01:06:12.272 --> 01:06:13.272
- Followed, why?

01:06:14.709 --> 01:06:16.146
- I think my family's in danger.

01:06:17.408 --> 01:06:19.081
- From who?

01:06:19.105 --> 01:06:21.151
- I can't tell you
until we get closer.

01:06:23.153 --> 01:06:26.547
- Okay, listen, whatever
it is, I want to help.

01:06:30.421 --> 01:06:35.208
- Okay, first off,
my name isn't Maya.

01:06:37.036 --> 01:06:39.101
- Okay, so you lied
about your name.

01:06:39.125 --> 01:06:40.257
- I lied about everything!

01:06:42.389 --> 01:06:45.194
The truth is, you wouldn't
believe me if I told you.

01:06:45.218 --> 01:06:46.480
I mean, I know I wouldn't.

01:06:48.091 --> 01:06:49.111
- Okay, well, why don't you let
me decide that for myself,

01:06:49.135 --> 01:06:50.135
if you don't mind.

01:07:02.279 --> 01:07:04.020
- I'm from the future.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:11.438
- What?

01:07:11.462 --> 01:07:13.831
- I knew you
wouldn't believe me!

01:07:13.855 --> 01:07:15.975
- Yeah, but I didn't think
you were going to say that.

01:07:15.999 --> 01:07:16.999
I mean, come on!

01:07:22.212 --> 01:07:25.974
Okay, what, so now some-some
faceless evil corporation

01:07:25.998 --> 01:07:28.237
is after you for your
time travel secrets.

01:07:28.261 --> 01:07:29.282
Is that what's going on?

01:07:29.306 --> 01:07:30.306
- Basically.

01:07:32.135 --> 01:07:34.441
They want to stop me from
changing the future.

01:07:36.008 --> 01:07:38.769
- Wow, this is, it's like I've
read this in a comic book

01:07:38.793 --> 01:07:40.336
or something, this
is incredible.

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.643
So, who are we going to see,

01:07:42.667 --> 01:07:44.384
or maybe I should ask
when are we going?

01:07:44.408 --> 01:07:45.472
- My parents.

01:07:45.496 --> 01:07:47.387
- Oh, your parents
from the past.

01:07:47.411 --> 01:07:49.215
- Yes.

01:07:49.239 --> 01:07:51.869
- Okay, so if you're
being followed,

01:07:51.893 --> 01:07:55.177
why would you lead the bad
guys right to your parents?

01:07:55.201 --> 01:07:56.918
- I'm going to warn them.

01:07:56.942 --> 01:07:59.051
- So, you're going to
show up on the doorstep

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:01.749
of your future, or past,
or whatever parents

01:08:01.773 --> 01:08:03.209
and tell them that story?

01:08:04.776 --> 01:08:06.908
- Well, what would you do?

01:08:07.866 --> 01:08:09.365
- Well, you know, first,

01:08:09.389 --> 01:08:12.238
I would probably set my
photon phaser to kill.

01:08:12.262 --> 01:08:13.282
- You know what, fine.

01:08:13.306 --> 01:08:14.306
Don't believe me!

01:08:17.788 --> 01:08:19.375
Can we go?

01:08:19.399 --> 01:08:20.399
- Yeah.

01:08:23.837 --> 01:08:25.100
- What the hell happened?

01:08:26.276 --> 01:08:28.080
- He was ready for us.

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:29.801
He got the jump on us.

01:08:31.411 --> 01:08:33.761
- Of course, he was ready,
he's trained to be!

01:08:36.502 --> 01:08:37.502
Any word from Leo?

01:09:04.879 --> 01:09:06.229
- Maya, Maya wait!

01:09:13.104 --> 01:09:14.279
I didn't mean to upset you.

01:09:15.325 --> 01:09:16.804
It's just the way it sounds.

01:09:19.328 --> 01:09:21.307
Look, I don't know
what's going on,

01:09:21.331 --> 01:09:23.594
and the truth is, I
don't really care.

01:09:25.421 --> 01:09:28.163
Alright, okay, so you're
from the future, fine!

01:09:30.557 --> 01:09:33.319
You could be from the future
or Mars, it doesn't matter.

01:09:33.343 --> 01:09:36.365
All that matters is that,
is that you're here

01:09:36.389 --> 01:09:41.264
and that you're safe,
and that you'll stay.

01:09:51.143 --> 01:09:52.143
What's wrong?

01:09:53.406 --> 01:09:54.407
Maya, what are you doing?

01:10:09.596 --> 01:10:10.596
- Hello?

01:10:14.166 --> 01:10:15.166
May I help you?

01:10:17.169 --> 01:10:20.216
- Ah, yes, are you Roger Reed?

01:10:22.827 --> 01:10:24.481
- Yeah, can I help you?

01:10:25.786 --> 01:10:27.938
- You just had a baby
girl last night, right?

01:10:27.962 --> 01:10:31.855
- Well, my wife did most of
the work, but yeah, I did.

01:10:31.879 --> 01:10:34.099
- Well, congratulations!

01:10:35.535 --> 01:10:38.799
I'm from the hospital, and
you've won a special prize.

01:10:41.933 --> 01:10:44.283
I apologize for the
unplanned visit.

01:10:46.154 --> 01:10:49.046
May I come in to talk
to you about it?

01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:50.333
It's just a little cold.

01:10:51.508 --> 01:10:52.987
It'll only take a second.

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:58.142
- Ah, yeah, yeah, I guess.

01:10:58.166 --> 01:10:59.166
Yeah, sure, come on.

01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:03.844
Honey, there's a girl
here from the hospital.

01:11:03.868 --> 01:11:05.870
She says we've won something.

01:11:06.827 --> 01:11:08.675
Come on in, sit down.

01:11:08.699 --> 01:11:10.416
What was your name again?

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:11.808
- Maya.

01:11:11.832 --> 01:11:15.551
- Honey, this is Maya, she's from St.
Joseph's.

01:11:15.575 --> 01:11:16.575
- Hello.

01:11:20.928 --> 01:11:22.863
- You guys have a
beautiful family.

01:11:22.887 --> 01:11:23.887
- Thank you.

01:11:25.585 --> 01:11:28.371
I'm Emma, and this is Samantha.

01:11:38.468 --> 01:11:39.643
- This is Alpha calling two.

01:11:43.342 --> 01:11:44.474
Report, two!

01:11:47.694 --> 01:11:48.694
Come in, two!

01:11:54.353 --> 01:11:55.354
- So, do we proceed?

01:12:00.272 --> 01:12:01.272
- Report two!

01:12:01.752 --> 01:12:03.469
Come in, two!

01:12:03.493 --> 01:12:06.559
- So, you work at the
hospital as a nurse?

01:12:06.583 --> 01:12:09.039
- No, um, I'm in administration.

01:12:09.063 --> 01:12:12.260
- And they have you out working
this late on a Thursday?

01:12:12.284 --> 01:12:15.611
- I know, I thought it
was on the way home.

01:12:15.635 --> 01:12:16.635
I just got lost.

01:12:17.724 --> 01:12:20.224
I'm sorry for
showing up so late.

01:12:20.248 --> 01:12:22.879
You know, I just didn't
want to disappoint anyone.

01:12:22.903 --> 01:12:24.925
But I wanted to come.

01:12:24.949 --> 01:12:27.299
I wanted to be the one to
give you the big news.

01:12:28.605 --> 01:12:30.974
- It's been 45 minutes
since he last checked in.

01:12:30.998 --> 01:12:31.998
- I'm well aware.

01:12:33.479 --> 01:12:35.399
- I'm just stating that
the standard CID protocol

01:12:35.423 --> 01:12:36.676
is to abandon an operative,

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:38.460
that deviates from his
direct objective.

01:12:38.484 --> 01:12:39.790
- I know the protocol.

01:12:40.921 --> 01:12:42.358
- So, we move without him.

01:12:44.316 --> 01:12:46.120
The target's confirmed, inside!

01:12:46.144 --> 01:12:47.972
- You don't have orders
until I give them.

01:13:02.726 --> 01:13:07.489
Grab the kid first, quietly,
and bring him back here.

01:13:07.513 --> 01:13:08.949
We don't want to tip her off.

01:13:11.474 --> 01:13:14.085
Then we will take the house.

01:13:31.624 --> 01:13:34.429
- I need you to step
out of the vehicle.

01:13:34.453 --> 01:13:37.127
- Okay, is something wrong?

01:13:37.151 --> 01:13:39.066
- Why don't you just
step out of the vehicle.

01:13:44.637 --> 01:13:45.638
- Ah, shit!

01:13:48.859 --> 01:13:52.926
- She said she wanted lemonade
with chocolate syrup in it!

01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:54.449
- What?

01:13:54.473 --> 01:13:56.712
I wanted something
sour then sweet!

01:13:56.736 --> 01:13:57.736
Why is that so crazy?

01:13:58.912 --> 01:14:00.712
- I mean, whatever gets
you through it, right?

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:03.066
- Exactly, I'm the one
doing all the work.

01:14:03.090 --> 01:14:05.112
All he had to do is watch.

01:14:05.136 --> 01:14:07.549
- Which, to be fair, isn't easy.

01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:12.685
- You better go get that,

01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:15.383
'cause you know you're
gonna lose this one.

01:14:15.407 --> 01:14:16.407
- Oh, okay.

01:14:21.152 --> 01:14:22.695
- No, don't go.

01:14:22.719 --> 01:14:24.174
- What?

01:14:24.198 --> 01:14:26.331
- Don't answer it, please.

01:14:28.768 --> 01:14:29.768
- Why?

01:14:31.249 --> 01:14:32.642
It's no problem.

01:14:33.643 --> 01:14:35.427
I'll just be a minute.

01:15:36.836 --> 01:15:37.836
- Hello?

01:15:41.754 --> 01:15:43.669
Please just take me, okay.

01:15:44.888 --> 01:15:46.542
Is anybody listening?

01:15:48.152 --> 01:15:49.152
Hello?

01:15:50.502 --> 01:15:52.828
- Good morning Ms. Eckels.

01:15:52.852 --> 01:15:57.572
We are glad to hear you will
finally be cooperating.

01:15:57.596 --> 01:16:02.055
- Please, just leave my
friends alone, okay.

01:16:02.079 --> 01:16:03.230
I'll do whatever you want.

01:16:03.254 --> 01:16:04.298
Don't do this!

01:16:05.822 --> 01:16:07.582
- I'm sorry Maya, I'm
afraid I can't do that.

01:16:11.436 --> 01:16:12.805
- Where are my
mother and father?

01:16:12.829 --> 01:16:13.829
Where's Tyler?

01:16:14.744 --> 01:16:16.809
You can't do this!

01:16:16.833 --> 01:16:19.768
- We are putting them to
the best possible use.

01:16:19.792 --> 01:16:22.815
- No don't do this, okay!

01:16:22.839 --> 01:16:25.426
You got me, that's
what you wanted right?

01:16:25.450 --> 01:16:26.930
I'll go back to St. Georges.

01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:46.055
Why are you doing this to us?

01:16:46.079 --> 01:16:47.796
- Excuse me?

01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:48.995
- Why are you doing this?

01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:53.390
- Don't you get it?

01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:55.740
That is what we do.

01:16:57.743 --> 01:16:59.615
This is the way it's
always been done.

01:17:01.704 --> 01:17:05.988
We just make sure the cards fall
where they are supposed to.

01:17:06.012 --> 01:17:08.362
We maintain this reality.

01:17:09.886 --> 01:17:11.951
- Where's my family?

01:17:11.975 --> 01:17:16.849
- Well, thanks to you, they
all now happily work here,

01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:20.766
and they're none the wiser
to this whole fiasco.

01:17:24.814 --> 01:17:27.401
- I didn't mean to.

01:17:27.425 --> 01:17:28.774
I just wanted to find my family.

01:17:30.907 --> 01:17:31.907
- Your family?

01:17:33.257 --> 01:17:35.868
They were never your family.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.742
You with your pissing
and moaning.

01:17:41.265 --> 01:17:42.266
Poor me.

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:45.506
I need to know why.

01:17:45.530 --> 01:17:47.010
Why doesn't anyone love me?

01:17:49.447 --> 01:17:51.318
You did this to us!

01:17:55.018 --> 01:17:56.759
Have you ever wanted to
take something back?

01:17:58.891 --> 01:18:01.851
Something that you
did a long time ago?

01:18:04.941 --> 01:18:08.834
You just dwell and dwell,
if I had just done

01:18:08.858 --> 01:18:13.689
this one thing different, my
entire life would be better.

01:18:18.650 --> 01:18:21.609
One decision can change
everything about you.

01:18:25.265 --> 01:18:28.138
Or maybe, it changes
nothing at all.

01:18:30.357 --> 01:18:34.424
Just a continuous loop that
you're forced to relive

01:18:34.448 --> 01:18:36.712
over and over again.

01:18:38.148 --> 01:18:40.063
Terrible and endless.

01:18:41.978 --> 01:18:42.978
No end.

01:18:44.850 --> 01:18:45.938
No way to stop it.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:55.121
Well, unfortunately,
or, well fortunately,

01:18:58.516 --> 01:19:02.868
we make sure everything
goes according to the plan.

01:19:07.655 --> 01:19:09.222
What if you already
know the plan?

01:19:11.572 --> 01:19:13.096
Does that mean you
can change it?

01:19:15.794 --> 01:19:17.317
- What are you talking about?

01:19:30.983 --> 01:19:33.116
- We don't know all the
effects of time travel,

01:19:34.987 --> 01:19:36.728
but we do know the side effects.

01:19:37.947 --> 01:19:39.905
You can't change the
past, Samantha.

01:19:49.697 --> 01:19:50.697
But, maybe.
