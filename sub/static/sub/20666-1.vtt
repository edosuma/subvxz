01:09.840 --> 01:12.161
Good morning, sir.
Welcome to Williamsburg Savings Bank.

01:12.320 --> 01:14.209
Let me just grab a pager for you here,

01:14.360 --> 01:16.761
and we'll get you to sit
with a banking professional

01:16.920 --> 01:18.331
as soon as one becomes available.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.047
What happens with this?

01:20.200 --> 01:21.929
Oh, it's going to light up and vibrate.

01:22.080 --> 01:24.526
The red lights spin around in a circle.
You won't be able to miss it.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.247
Where do I wait?

01:26.960 --> 01:28.166
The guest lounge.

01:47.680 --> 01:49.205
We're ready for you now.

02:00.640 --> 02:03.849
I'm seeing an overdrawn balance
in your daily checking.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.526
Seems like your direct deposits haven't been

02:06.680 --> 02:09.001
received in a few months. From...

02:09.639 --> 02:11.085
Wechsler Steel.

02:11.240 --> 02:13.049
Yeah, I've been phoning them for weeks.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.690
I couldn't get a straight answer.

02:15.280 --> 02:19.763
And how about this, uh, foreclosure notice?

02:19.920 --> 02:23.322
Ah. The yellow one.
So you must be in default.

02:23.480 --> 02:26.689
My mortgage payment tripled. Overnight.

02:29.440 --> 02:34.048
You were on our teaser rate promo,
which expired back in January.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.202
That's why it's called a teaser rate.

02:36.360 --> 02:38.647
Right? It doesn't last. Make sense?

02:38.840 --> 02:40.763
And the new rate is quite a bit higher,

02:40.920 --> 02:44.322
so the monthly mortgage payment jumped up.

02:44.480 --> 02:48.804
Now, we are required to disclose
that possibility at the time of the refi.

02:49.240 --> 02:51.242
- You did.
- I did what?

02:51.880 --> 02:54.008
You sold me this crap.

02:56.360 --> 02:57.361
Joe Harding.

02:57.520 --> 02:59.249
No. I know the name.

02:59.400 --> 03:02.722
Let me just look at my notes here.

03:05.880 --> 03:07.689
Terms disclosed.

03:08.720 --> 03:09.881
I personally disclosed

03:10.080 --> 03:13.687
the possibility of a rate hike
during your refi.

03:13.880 --> 03:15.564
Do you remember that?

03:15.720 --> 03:16.846
You told me

03:17.000 --> 03:20.641
that the odds on the rate
going past the prime rate

03:20.840 --> 03:22.524
were extraordinary.

03:22.720 --> 03:24.210
But possible.

03:24.360 --> 03:27.842
But you sold me "extraordinary."

03:28.000 --> 03:32.050
- But the "possible" was disclosed.
- Listen, Chuck.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.851
My granddaughter and my daughter,
they live with me.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.844
She is a nurse's aide, you know,
low pay and all that.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.561
She wanted her kid to go to a better
school, so they moved in with me.

03:41.720 --> 03:44.530
- Lots of people doing that.
- Yeah. So you see,

03:44.680 --> 03:46.409
I can't lose my house.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.642
Not to worry.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.529
You're on the yellow notice.

03:50.680 --> 03:54.321
The red one is more weighty.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.085
Can I talk with someone else?

03:56.240 --> 03:58.288
- Who?
- Someone smarter?

04:01.560 --> 04:04.211
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your attention.

04:04.360 --> 04:05.930
We've come to make a withdrawal.

04:14.280 --> 04:18.370
Aside from the tellers, we invite you
to lie down on the floor, face up,

04:18.519 --> 04:22.002
and hold your arms and legs
in the air like a pussycat.

04:24.440 --> 04:25.601
Everybody down!

04:32.320 --> 04:33.321
Tellers,

04:33.480 --> 04:36.689
please do not be foolish enough
to trigger the silent alarm.

04:36.880 --> 04:39.611
The last people we want here
would be the police.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.286
That would be messy, no?

04:41.440 --> 04:42.680
Put 'em up.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.409
Why this? Oh, my God. Why here?
What did I do?

04:45.560 --> 04:46.561
Hey!

04:46.840 --> 04:48.649
I follow the book. Just follow procedure.

04:48.800 --> 04:49.881
Just stay calm. Stay calm.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.690
- Follow procedure.
- Hey!

04:51.840 --> 04:53.251
You're going to get yourself shot!

04:53.400 --> 04:56.449
Gentlemen, it's best to remain silent.

04:56.600 --> 04:57.806
I'm cramping.

04:57.960 --> 04:59.849
Relax, please. You can sit up.

05:00.040 --> 05:02.281
- Ah.
- Hey, no! Not you! Pussycat!

05:03.680 --> 05:05.603
Keep stuffing it in there. Let's go. Come on.

05:05.760 --> 05:06.761
You can have this.

05:13.040 --> 05:17.648
I'm sorry you're a casualty of a corrupt
system that no longer serves the people.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.087
Yeah. I've been banking here for 40 years.

05:20.240 --> 05:22.846
You're just an account number.

05:23.280 --> 05:25.169
It's not much, but it's all yours.

05:25.320 --> 05:28.449
No, my friend. Not from you.

05:29.680 --> 05:33.241
It is a culture's duty
to take care of its elderly.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.724
Chuck here couldn't give a crap.

05:36.240 --> 05:37.241
Chuck.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.643
- Are you Chuck?
- Yes.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.848
I'm Chuck. I'm Chuck.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.480
Are you the one taking this man's house?

05:45.640 --> 05:47.324
- I'm not, personally.
- Give me your wallet.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.084
Okay. Look, I got... I have...

05:49.280 --> 05:52.090
I have plenty of stuff here, okay? Cash.

05:52.240 --> 05:54.527
There's a gym membership.
Take it. I never go.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.731
Fifteen seconds.

05:56.880 --> 05:58.848
- Pussycat!
- Meow.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.405
Shut up!

06:05.640 --> 06:08.610
I'm happy to say,
our time together has ended.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.690
Please do not call the police for 90 seconds.

06:11.840 --> 06:14.923
A shoot-out never has a happy ending.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.960
Oh. They make a pill for that.

06:42.480 --> 06:45.484
That looks like a gang tattoo to me.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.968
Very detailed.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.361
I imagine the artist did them all.

06:50.520 --> 06:53.364
So, if you find the tattoo parlor,

06:53.520 --> 06:56.763
then you'll find the artist,
and you've got yourself a bank robber.

06:56.920 --> 06:58.604
Sounds pretty standard to me.

06:58.760 --> 07:01.240
Right. Well, thanks a lot, old-timer.

07:01.440 --> 07:03.886
You know,
we're going to get you an application.

07:04.040 --> 07:05.451
Hey, listen. I've watched this TV show

07:06.440 --> 07:11.082
called Law and Order, and they solve
crimes much quicker than you do.

07:11.280 --> 07:12.725
You should tune in.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.129
Well, you know, in the real world,

07:16.280 --> 07:20.251
solving crimes takes a little longer
than a one-hour television show.

07:20.400 --> 07:23.643
Well, I guess this wraps it up
for us, Mr. Harding.

07:23.880 --> 07:27.441
If we need any additional information,
then we'll get in contact with you.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.568
Oh. You'll need my address and phone number.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.000
Uh, not necessary.

07:32.320 --> 07:35.290
We'll find you. That's what we do.

07:37.760 --> 07:39.410
So, what'd they look like?

07:39.600 --> 07:41.284
It was hard to tell. They had masks on.

07:41.480 --> 07:44.131
I got close to one.
It was a male, about six feet.

07:44.280 --> 07:47.045
And he had this tattoo
wrapped around his neck

07:47.200 --> 07:48.770
that I told you about.

07:48.920 --> 07:51.127
You know, you find the tattoo artist...

07:51.320 --> 07:53.004
- You find the criminal.
- Exactly.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.201
That's what I told them.

07:54.360 --> 07:56.647
Okay. I'm sure you're not
supposed to be talking about all of this.

07:57.720 --> 08:00.564
It must have been so cool
being in the middle of a heist.

08:00.720 --> 08:02.563
Crime is not cool, babe.

08:02.720 --> 08:04.484
He could have been shot.

08:05.920 --> 08:06.921
Or worse.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.923
What's worse than being shot?

08:09.080 --> 08:10.684
Being shot twice.

08:12.720 --> 08:17.204
This kind of detail is traditionally
indicative of gang affiliation.

08:17.360 --> 08:20.887
We believe these individuals
used the same tattoo artist.

08:21.040 --> 08:23.088
If we can find this artist,
then we can find our perp.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.724
It's pretty standard stuff really.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.451
- Hey, that's what we said.
- Any other questions?

08:28.640 --> 08:29.801
What an asshole.

08:30.040 --> 08:31.371
Language.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.849
If you have any information
regarding this tattoo artist...

08:38.840 --> 08:40.330
Bingo!

08:40.480 --> 08:45.407
"The three men walked off
with approximately 1 .6 million dollars.

08:45.720 --> 08:48.041
"The FBI and the NYPD

08:48.200 --> 08:51.124
"are reporting no leads at this time."

08:51.280 --> 08:52.281
So what?

08:52.520 --> 08:55.569
Nobody gets hurt except the insurance
company. And they'll be fine.

08:55.760 --> 08:57.683
They were as cool as cucumbers, gents.

08:57.840 --> 09:00.650
They choreographed it down to the second.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.962
Like a dance.

09:03.120 --> 09:05.441
Yeah, a conga line right into prison.

09:05.720 --> 09:07.006
Are we going to play or what?

09:07.640 --> 09:09.130
Ask the man in charge.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.001
Milton?

09:11.760 --> 09:13.569
Milton!

09:13.720 --> 09:15.768
Who're we rolling with on two?

09:15.920 --> 09:18.048
Oh! Oh, yeah.

09:21.720 --> 09:24.121
G-52.

09:25.480 --> 09:28.211
If I ever get that bad, shoot me.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.007
Oh.

09:32.680 --> 09:33.681
Did you get one of these?

09:34.680 --> 09:36.091
It came certified mail.

09:36.240 --> 09:37.401
Yes, sir.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.927
You ever get good news
that needed a signature?

09:40.080 --> 09:41.889
You contact anybody down at the plant?

09:42.040 --> 09:44.441
Oh, not yet.
But we'll find out what's going on.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.045
I need my pension money.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.043
Oh. Yeah, tell me about it.

09:49.200 --> 09:52.363
I have something very important to say.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.766
G-52.

09:56.880 --> 09:59.042
Let's go and help the elderly.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.443
Now, at the time of our merger,

10:05.600 --> 10:10.606
Semtech had no intentions
of shuttering U.S. operations.

10:12.680 --> 10:16.366
However, with the demand
for specialty parts way down,

10:16.520 --> 10:20.366
and the cost of operations
in this country rising steadily,

10:21.200 --> 10:24.124
they have made the decision

10:24.280 --> 10:26.601
to move all manufacturing to Vietnam.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.721
Wechsler's stateside operations

10:33.880 --> 10:36.167
will be phased out over the next 30 days.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.169
30 days? What, are you kidding me?

10:39.400 --> 10:41.880
Guys, I understand this is harsh news.

10:42.560 --> 10:45.530
I can only address you in an orderly fashion.

10:47.440 --> 10:49.408
Excuse me, Mr. Lewis.

10:49.560 --> 10:50.925
Hi, Joe.

10:51.080 --> 10:53.242
What is this about?

10:53.400 --> 10:55.687
What's going on with our pensions?

10:56.400 --> 10:59.609
Semtech Steel has frozen

10:59.800 --> 11:03.043
all pension payments
during this transitional period.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.969
What does that mean? Frozen?

11:07.520 --> 11:09.727
Wechsler maintained a fund

11:09.880 --> 11:12.690
to honor all pre-merger pension plans,

11:12.840 --> 11:15.605
which was eventually to be married
with the new pension fund

11:15.760 --> 11:17.762
under the new labor contract.

11:17.920 --> 11:20.127
For God's sake, can you say that in English?

11:22.960 --> 11:27.329
No U.S. operations,
no fiscal responsibility for Semtech.

11:27.480 --> 11:30.324
The pension fund is being dissolved.

11:37.720 --> 11:40.451
With all due respect, Donald,

11:40.600 --> 11:45.401
thirty years of hard work
means shit to you people!

11:49.880 --> 11:52.804
Without my pension money,
I can't even pay rent this month.

11:53.160 --> 11:55.686
We'll get a lawyer and sue
the piss out of them.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.002
Shit. We'd be dead
by the time the settlement comes in.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.003
Which would suit them just fine.

12:00.360 --> 12:02.044
When did coffee go to two dollars?

12:02.240 --> 12:03.605
A decade ago.

12:03.760 --> 12:06.650
God forbid you get extra foam on the top,
you have to make payments.

12:07.080 --> 12:08.684
Let's leave her 20%.

12:08.840 --> 12:11.810
Okay, good. Now she can take a cruise.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.287
Okay, boys. I got a half a rhubarb left.

12:14.440 --> 12:17.364
We got the blueberry crumble,
which is a little stale.

12:17.520 --> 12:20.330
And I got the mud pie.
So, what's it gonna be?

12:21.040 --> 12:22.610
Uh, not today. Thank you.

12:22.840 --> 12:23.841
No pie?

12:24.000 --> 12:25.650
We're watching our waistlines.

12:25.800 --> 12:28.041
Plus we're shit broke.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.328
Okay. Well, don't tie up my table all day.

12:30.520 --> 12:31.931
I gotta make a living here.

12:33.640 --> 12:37.531
Did I tell you those guys in the bank
had machine guns?

12:37.680 --> 12:39.569
You told us six times already!

12:39.720 --> 12:42.087
Yeah, well, it keeps going in my head.

12:42.280 --> 12:44.282
Over and over, you know?

12:44.440 --> 12:46.090
Maybe you're having a stroke.

12:47.560 --> 12:50.006
Here you go, boys. Always have your pie.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.884
Life is short.

12:52.080 --> 12:53.889
Well, thanks for the reminder.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.201
She's right, you know.

12:56.360 --> 12:59.284
We should be having our pie and eating it.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.568
We've earned that much, at least.

13:05.880 --> 13:08.690
- Gentlemen, good evening.
- Good evening.

13:08.840 --> 13:12.003
Welcome to what is essentially
the last rose ceremony.

13:13.520 --> 13:16.046
Kaitlyn, this is the final rose tonight.

13:16.200 --> 13:19.124
She can count, Einstein!

13:19.280 --> 13:21.362
My heart is beating
out of my chest right now.

13:21.520 --> 13:25.286
This week was... incredible.

13:25.440 --> 13:27.807
Shawn's boring, and Nick's a man-whore.

13:28.640 --> 13:31.564
Monogamy is an outdated concept.

13:31.720 --> 13:35.486
I am in love and that's so exciting.

13:35.640 --> 13:39.008
Ben. The only choice she's got.

13:39.160 --> 13:41.049
She's not going to move to a farm
in those heels.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.646
She's kissed them all. With her tongue.

13:43.840 --> 13:47.686
Done the whole cast that way.
She's a walking venereal disease!

13:47.840 --> 13:50.127
When I think about this week,
how everything went

13:50.280 --> 13:52.806
has made my decision feel,
like, almost impossible.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.883
Kaitlyn, close your mouth.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.041
Nick.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.123
- Oh, shit!
- God!

14:06.320 --> 14:08.926
Turn it off. It's a travesty.

14:09.600 --> 14:10.931
They never learn.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.646
I'm going home and sort out my pills.

14:14.600 --> 14:15.931
Tomorrow, gents.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.562
That was a great meal tonight.

14:18.720 --> 14:22.122
What you can do with frozen fish
is admirable.

14:22.440 --> 14:23.646
Best garlic bread I ever had.

14:23.840 --> 14:26.684
And that combination
of paprika and garlic, oh!

14:27.560 --> 14:28.721
- Fantastic!
- Oh. Whoo!

14:28.880 --> 14:31.087
Actually, I think it was the mold.

14:32.760 --> 14:34.364
All right. Good night.

14:34.840 --> 14:35.841
Joe.

14:37.240 --> 14:38.241
What?

14:39.120 --> 14:40.485
We'll be all right?

14:40.640 --> 14:44.008
Sure, we will.
It always works out in the end.

14:45.320 --> 14:46.446
And then you die.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.648
Oh, thanks for the inspiration, Albert.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.843
Good night, all. I'll see you tomorrow.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.731
- Good night, Joe.
- Good night.

15:29.800 --> 15:32.201
Assholes.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.887
Hey, Willie. How you feeling?

15:51.040 --> 15:53.964
Partly cloudy, Doc. Partly cloudy.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.327
Well, I'm not going to lie to you.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.209
You can. I won't mind.

15:58.360 --> 16:00.488
The dialysis is working marginally.

16:00.640 --> 16:03.007
You know, a kidney is all
that's going to get you well.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.526
Well, I'll look on eBay.

16:06.680 --> 16:08.682
You're way down the list.
It's partially your age,

16:08.840 --> 16:11.081
it's partially your insurance.
It's partially...

16:11.280 --> 16:13.681
Kidneys aren't that easy to come by.

16:13.840 --> 16:17.367
Yeah. Everybody wants to hold on to theirs.

16:17.520 --> 16:20.251
Have you talked to your daughter?
Your friends?

16:20.400 --> 16:22.641
It's common to find a donor in your circles.

16:22.800 --> 16:25.246
And that's often the best match anyway.

16:26.680 --> 16:27.841
I'll talk to them.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.170
Sooner than later.

16:31.880 --> 16:33.564
So, what are we talking about?

16:36.160 --> 16:38.731
We're talking about much sooner than later.

16:42.840 --> 16:43.841
Hello?

16:44.040 --> 16:45.326
You get your presents, Boppa?

16:45.520 --> 16:46.521
You send something?

16:47.840 --> 16:50.809
Wait a minute, the postman
brought me this box right here,

16:51.000 --> 16:52.286
but that can't be it.

16:52.440 --> 16:54.442
That's it, that's it! Open it already!

16:54.600 --> 16:57.444
All right, all right.
Hold your horses. I'm old.

16:59.960 --> 17:02.122
Oh, my goodness.

17:02.440 --> 17:03.680
This...

17:04.000 --> 17:07.891
This is the ugliest shirt I've ever seen.

17:08.040 --> 17:09.040
Boppa.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.929
All right. Let's see
what else is down in here.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.723
You're getting real big, K.

17:20.880 --> 17:22.803
Grew an inch in a month, Boppa.

17:23.760 --> 17:27.526
Hey, you tell your mom

17:27.680 --> 17:31.048
that her career isn't as important
as seeing her family.

17:32.440 --> 17:33.601
I will.

17:33.760 --> 17:35.569
- Promise?
- I promise.

17:35.720 --> 17:37.165
Good girl.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.449
- That's my ride.
- Okay.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.082
Oh, Jesus Christ.

18:18.760 --> 18:19.761
Ezra!

18:20.680 --> 18:21.681
Ezra!

18:22.560 --> 18:25.404
You gotta stop this. I can't listen anymore.

18:25.560 --> 18:26.721
I've been practicing!

18:26.880 --> 18:28.723
Yeah, but it doesn't matter
'cause you get worse every week.

18:28.920 --> 18:30.410
It's kind of a miracle.
I don't know how you do it.

18:30.600 --> 18:33.126
So what's the point? You're no good,
you don't like it,

18:33.280 --> 18:34.520
you're not gonna be a professional.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.887
You wanna end up like me,
working in a factory?

18:37.040 --> 18:39.691
And every two months you're getting
a gig for 40 bucks at some dive?

18:39.840 --> 18:40.841
You don't want that.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.240
I don't even like this thing.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.209
No! And it doesn't like you, either.

18:44.360 --> 18:47.842
Trust me, I'm doing you a favor.
You'll thank me for this.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.126
Thank you, sir.

18:49.280 --> 18:50.611
Oh, you're very welcome.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.970
I want to be a dancer, like Beyoncé.

18:54.120 --> 18:56.566
Well, it's none of my business.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.007
Okay. All right, good.

18:59.200 --> 19:01.646
All right, get off. Get off me.

19:01.800 --> 19:04.326
Get off. I'll go find your grandma.

19:04.480 --> 19:07.211
She's still got to pay me for the session.

19:10.520 --> 19:12.568
You gotta think of it like
putting down a horse.

19:12.720 --> 19:16.008
Sometimes, it's the kindest,
most ethical thing you can do.

19:16.160 --> 19:19.448
Well, thank you for being so honest with me.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.967
I really appreciate your candor.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.930
Well, your grandson hasn't
got a musical bone in his body.

19:25.080 --> 19:29.005
I know. It was so painful listening
in the other room.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.481
And I had to sit across from him.

19:32.120 --> 19:33.281
Okay.

19:33.480 --> 19:34.561
- Al.
- Yeah?

19:34.720 --> 19:38.122
I never told you this,
but I've seen you perform a few times.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.523
- Ah...
- In the West Village

19:40.680 --> 19:43.160
with Stan Getz, 1977.

19:43.320 --> 19:45.129
It was stunning.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.281
You saw me play with Getz?

19:46.440 --> 19:47.441
Sure did.

19:47.600 --> 19:48.761
What are you, following me?

19:48.920 --> 19:52.402
No. I was following the music.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.489
Um, hey. I'll see you at the store, okay?

19:56.640 --> 19:58.051
See you at the store.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.201
Yup.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.050
All right.

20:04.680 --> 20:05.681
See you tomorrow!

20:05.840 --> 20:07.126
Bye, guys.

20:12.160 --> 20:13.844
You know, at some point,

20:14.040 --> 20:16.850
I'm gonna have to start
walking home on my own.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.365
I'm 14.

20:18.560 --> 20:20.403
Not on my watch, lovie.

20:20.560 --> 20:23.370
This neighborhood is not the same
as it was 40 years ago.

20:23.520 --> 20:27.127
Right. It's safer and more gentrified.

20:28.400 --> 20:29.526
Bam.

20:29.680 --> 20:31.125
And what is this?

20:31.280 --> 20:33.248
It's my biology test.

20:33.680 --> 20:35.682
Another day, another A.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.482
Well done, kiddo.

20:38.640 --> 20:39.801
I'm almost there.

20:39.960 --> 20:40.961
Almost where?

20:41.120 --> 20:43.885
You said, and I quote,

20:44.040 --> 20:46.691
"You get straight A's, you get a puppy."

20:47.040 --> 20:48.883
I like your confidence.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.088
Must have got that from you, young man.

20:51.240 --> 20:54.767
Not bad, kiddo. Not bad at all.

21:09.720 --> 21:12.564
Happy Birthday, young man.

21:13.160 --> 21:15.731
Didn't expect you broke bastards
to get me anything.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.487
Temper your enthusiasm. It's not much.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.770
That's just what I needed.

21:22.920 --> 21:23.967
- Yup.
- Mmm-hmm.

21:24.120 --> 21:25.485
- One can't get enough time.
- Oh.

21:25.840 --> 21:27.649
Take a look at that cute picture.

21:27.840 --> 21:30.525
Oh, yeah. My little K.

21:30.720 --> 21:33.007
When you die,
you can will it to her as a memento.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.281
Thanks, Al.

21:34.480 --> 21:39.247
I'm sure she'll want a picture of herself
on a watch from her dead grandpa.

21:40.360 --> 21:43.364
Look at that. That's really something.

21:43.520 --> 21:44.726
You bet, kid.

21:46.440 --> 21:48.647
This corn is from World War Two.

21:49.520 --> 21:50.726
Corn?

21:51.320 --> 21:52.810
I thought this was...

21:54.640 --> 21:57.120
I don't know what I thought it was.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.361
I think I may rob a bank.

22:18.960 --> 22:19.961
What was that?

22:21.720 --> 22:25.281
I'm thinking of robbing a bank.

22:25.440 --> 22:26.487
Oh.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.688
I'm thinking about buying a Ferrari.

22:28.840 --> 22:32.049
Hmm. I just got drafted by the Knicks.
Good week for everybody, huh?

22:32.560 --> 22:34.369
Good week.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.164
They're taking my house.

22:38.320 --> 22:39.446
Huh?

22:39.600 --> 22:41.204
They're taking my house.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.646
I've got 30 days.

22:42.840 --> 22:44.126
Who's taking your house?

22:44.280 --> 22:45.327
The bank.

22:45.480 --> 22:46.925
They're taking your house
and you didn't tell us?

22:47.080 --> 22:49.003
What are you gonna do? Lend me money?

22:49.160 --> 22:52.243
We're all broke. The three of us combined.

22:52.400 --> 22:56.724
These banks practically destroyed
this country.

22:56.880 --> 23:00.009
They crushed a lot of people's dreams.

23:00.160 --> 23:03.403
And nothing ever happened to them.

23:03.560 --> 23:07.007
We're three old guys.
We hit a bank, we get away with it,

23:07.160 --> 23:10.687
we retire with dignity.

23:10.840 --> 23:12.808
Worst comes to the worst, we get caught,

23:12.960 --> 23:15.406
we get a bed, three meals a day

23:15.560 --> 23:18.609
and better healthcare than we get now.

23:19.240 --> 23:20.401
You...

23:21.000 --> 23:23.128
You're talking about us?

23:23.920 --> 23:25.001
Us and you?

23:25.160 --> 23:28.403
Yeah, I mean, if a gang of thugs
can do it, it can't be that hard.

23:28.560 --> 23:29.766
You're out of your frigging mind.

23:29.920 --> 23:34.642
You have spent 20 years waiting to die, Al.

23:34.800 --> 23:37.201
With no life and no purpose.

23:37.360 --> 23:39.328
And robbing a bank
is going to give me a purpose?

23:39.520 --> 23:41.204
It will give us money.

23:41.360 --> 23:44.284
Willie would be able to get on a plane
and go and see his granddaughter.

23:44.480 --> 23:46.721
It's a little hard to catch a plane
out of prison, Joe.

23:46.880 --> 23:48.928
Yeah, but we won't get caught.

23:49.080 --> 23:50.605
They didn't get caught.

23:50.760 --> 23:53.525
Well, they were young. They were fast.

23:53.680 --> 23:56.365
We got skills, experience. Smarts.

23:56.520 --> 23:59.205
Arthritis, gout, shingles.

24:20.920 --> 24:22.251
Make a wish, Willie.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.121
Hello?

24:56.280 --> 24:57.964
I'm just lying here,

24:58.120 --> 25:02.603
thinking about all of the birthday
wishes that I have had over the years.

25:03.480 --> 25:05.369
And how many of them I've kept secret.

25:05.560 --> 25:07.961
And none of them ever came true.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.529
They never seem to pay out.

25:10.880 --> 25:13.611
So I figure I'm going to
tell you this one, Joe.

25:13.760 --> 25:16.081
I mean, what's the worst that can happen?

25:16.280 --> 25:17.520
A whole bunch of nothing, right?

25:17.680 --> 25:19.523
Fire away, Willie.

25:22.320 --> 25:25.722
I want to live better than I am.

25:25.920 --> 25:30.289
I want to see my family
more than once a year.

25:30.440 --> 25:33.762
And from here on in,

25:33.960 --> 25:36.770
I want to have a piece of pie
whenever the hell I want a piece of pie.

25:36.920 --> 25:38.126
You know what I mean?

25:38.280 --> 25:41.363
Hear, hear.

25:43.640 --> 25:45.961
You were serious today.

25:46.120 --> 25:47.804
I think so.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.448
The thing is,

25:50.600 --> 25:52.045
we have nothing to lose.

25:54.800 --> 25:56.370
I'm not a thief, Joe.

25:56.520 --> 25:58.170
Neither am I.

25:59.840 --> 26:02.571
We take exactly what's owed
on the pension, right?

26:02.720 --> 26:04.051
That's all I want.

26:04.200 --> 26:05.247
Not a penny more.

26:05.400 --> 26:06.606
My word.

26:07.640 --> 26:08.801
Wake Al up.

26:09.440 --> 26:10.726
Hold on.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.560
Al.

26:13.680 --> 26:15.364
Al.

26:16.280 --> 26:17.281
Albert!

26:17.480 --> 26:18.766
- Huh?
- Pick up the phone!

26:18.920 --> 26:19.921
Who died?

26:20.080 --> 26:21.525
Nobody died, it's Joe.

26:21.720 --> 26:23.131
I don't talk to criminals.

26:24.920 --> 26:25.921
You heard that?

26:26.080 --> 26:28.082
Hang up. I'll call him back.

26:33.480 --> 26:34.686
What do you want?

26:34.880 --> 26:37.850
The thing is, what do you want, Al?

26:38.000 --> 26:42.403
You want to drift off into the sunset,
or do you want to go out with a bang?

26:42.560 --> 26:43.846
I don't have a problem with dying.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.570
I just don't want to do it in prison.

26:45.720 --> 26:47.006
Nobody's going to prison.

26:47.160 --> 26:48.889
What exactly is happening here?

26:49.080 --> 26:50.286
Willie's in.

26:50.440 --> 26:51.805
You're both out of your minds.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.081
Sleep on it, Al.

26:53.240 --> 26:55.686
I don't need to sleep on anything.
I'm not a bank robber.

26:55.880 --> 26:58.121
Neither are you, or you, Willie.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.081
What?

27:03.240 --> 27:04.480
Why did you pick up the phone?

27:04.680 --> 27:05.966
Because it was ringing.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.451
Because you're interested.

27:07.640 --> 27:09.085
What are you, my psychiatrist now?

27:09.240 --> 27:10.446
More like a psychic.

27:10.600 --> 27:12.682
Well, then you know I'm going to hang up now.

27:12.840 --> 27:13.887
I'll see you tomorrow, Al.

27:14.400 --> 27:15.401
Sweet dreams.

27:15.560 --> 27:17.324
And don't call back.

27:42.320 --> 27:46.325
All right, Willie.
It's time to walk before we run.

27:48.080 --> 27:51.448
These goddamn expiration dates
are so small, they want you to go blind.

27:51.600 --> 27:54.285
Take these, I got two for one.

27:54.480 --> 27:56.084
Oh, good. Chicken thighs are on special.

27:56.240 --> 27:57.685
I can make a cordon bleu.

27:57.840 --> 27:58.921
Mets or Yankees?

27:59.080 --> 28:00.764
Don't insult me.

28:04.280 --> 28:05.805
Huh. Nice hats.

28:06.320 --> 28:08.129
We got business here, Al.

28:08.280 --> 28:10.282
Okay. What do you mean?

28:10.640 --> 28:11.641
Give me that list.

28:11.800 --> 28:13.165
What are you doing?

28:13.320 --> 28:15.004
Wait here. We'll be right back.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.969
What are you doing with my list?

28:17.120 --> 28:18.804
Why did you rip up my list?

28:18.960 --> 28:20.530
Why should I wait in the car?

28:21.440 --> 28:22.965
Wait in the bloody car!

28:23.120 --> 28:24.531
Why?

28:26.280 --> 28:28.442
I don't want to stay in the car,
it's hot in here!

28:46.520 --> 28:48.682
Psst! Psst!

28:49.200 --> 28:53.728
Psst! Joe. Joe! Behind the crumbs.

28:55.320 --> 28:57.004
Joe, I'm going to get a roast.

28:57.160 --> 28:59.640
We need chicken. It's cordon bleu.

28:59.840 --> 29:01.330
I don't want cordon bleu.

29:01.480 --> 29:02.845
Stick to the plan!

29:06.840 --> 29:08.888
Ah, welcome to Value...

29:09.040 --> 29:10.041
Hello, Al.

29:10.200 --> 29:11.201
Hi, Annie.

29:11.360 --> 29:12.600
What are you shopping for?

29:12.760 --> 29:15.684
Chicken cordon bleu was the plan,

29:15.880 --> 29:18.884
but the plan seems to be changing.

29:21.840 --> 29:23.444
I gotta get some chicken thighs.

29:23.600 --> 29:26.080
Oh, let me help you.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.531
Give me the big one.

29:51.560 --> 29:52.561
The whole thing?

29:52.880 --> 29:54.723
The whole damn thing.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.804
You're the boss.

30:00.920 --> 30:03.730
Annie, just let me have the thing.

30:03.880 --> 30:05.723
Come on, you have your own work to do now.

30:05.880 --> 30:09.043
No, no. It's my job. There's no problem.

30:09.440 --> 30:12.250
Let's see.
There's a double coupon in the flyer.

30:12.400 --> 30:16.483
It costs about the same as thighs
but, see, these are breasts.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.928
And breasts are better than thighs,
don't you think?

30:20.600 --> 30:22.011
It could go either way.

30:26.400 --> 30:28.243
Oh, ham.

30:28.400 --> 30:30.084
So good.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.323
Do you like ham?

30:44.920 --> 30:46.604
Okay.

30:46.760 --> 30:49.127
This will go perfectly with...

30:49.320 --> 30:52.290
I mean, if you want company.
It's a big bottle.

30:52.440 --> 30:54.010
Yeah, listen, I got to tell you.

30:54.200 --> 30:56.680
You're a terrific person,
but I know what you're doing.

30:56.840 --> 30:59.969
You're wasting your time. I don't want
to have a relationship with anybody.

31:00.120 --> 31:01.167
I wasn't offering one.

31:01.320 --> 31:03.448
Good, great. Then we see eye to eye.

31:03.600 --> 31:07.321
Security to ethnic foods, please.

31:07.480 --> 31:09.130
We'll talk about this later.

31:09.320 --> 31:12.005
I'll look forward to it.

31:55.680 --> 31:58.331
Where the fuck is my basket?

32:03.560 --> 32:04.846
Willie, Willie.

32:05.280 --> 32:06.327
Al's gone.

32:06.560 --> 32:07.925
I got a new getaway car.

32:08.080 --> 32:09.570
Where the hell did you get that thing?

32:09.720 --> 32:10.721
I stole it.

32:10.880 --> 32:12.006
Jump in the basket.

32:12.200 --> 32:13.884
Who the hell do you think I am? E.T.?

32:14.040 --> 32:15.451
Willie, jump in the bloody basket.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.125
I'm not getting in no bloody basket!

32:25.040 --> 32:26.280
She's gaining on us.

32:29.440 --> 32:30.930
Hey, you. Stop right there!

32:32.040 --> 32:33.201
Hey! Halt!

32:33.360 --> 32:35.203
- Halt!
- What are you chasing me for?

32:35.440 --> 32:36.441
Halt!

32:36.640 --> 32:38.085
I heard you the first time.

32:38.240 --> 32:39.890
Don't make me tase you!

32:40.400 --> 32:43.643
This is not an admission of guilt!
I am just tired.

32:43.800 --> 32:45.404
We got to get rid of some weight.

32:45.560 --> 32:47.050
Get rid of that damned pork loin.

32:47.200 --> 32:48.201
What?

32:50.120 --> 32:51.201
What the...

32:51.400 --> 32:53.243
Flour, flour. Give me the flour.

32:55.280 --> 32:56.281
Halt!

32:58.080 --> 32:59.320
Halt!

32:59.480 --> 33:00.481
Stop!

33:07.440 --> 33:08.566
I think we can make the light.

33:09.920 --> 33:11.251
No, no, no. You're not going to
make the light, Joe.

33:11.400 --> 33:12.447
You're not gonna make the light.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.241
Hey!

33:14.400 --> 33:15.606
No, Joe, you can't make the light!

33:15.800 --> 33:17.450
We can make the light! We're gonna do it!

33:17.640 --> 33:18.926
You're not gonna make the light!

33:19.080 --> 33:20.809
Yes, we are!

33:25.760 --> 33:27.444
Don't make another move.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.447
I don't know what's going on
in the world anymore.

33:39.920 --> 33:43.481
You were going to make a cordon bleu
with chicken thighs?

33:43.640 --> 33:45.449
That's a crime in and of itself.

33:45.600 --> 33:48.046
I have nothing to say for myself.

33:49.280 --> 33:50.964
Look what you did to Cindy.

33:51.880 --> 33:55.123
Now she looking like a Colombian drug mule.

34:02.280 --> 34:03.850
Never

34:04.000 --> 34:05.161
in all my years

34:05.320 --> 34:08.960
has anybody ever walked off
with a whole pork loin.

34:09.560 --> 34:10.686
What would your momma say?

34:11.280 --> 34:13.043
Go big or go home.

34:14.639 --> 34:16.960
Had to be the brother.

34:24.639 --> 34:26.563
And why were you running?
You didn't steal anything.

34:26.719 --> 34:28.563
Because your storm trooper here
was chasing me.

34:28.719 --> 34:30.085
No, they were chasing your friends.

34:30.239 --> 34:32.481
He was chasing me.
When somebody chases me, I run.

34:32.639 --> 34:33.641
That's the way it works.

34:34.239 --> 34:37.244
Look, you guys are old.

34:37.400 --> 34:40.882
And I'm gonna be there in 40,
or 50 years, I get it.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.045
Here.

34:43.760 --> 34:44.886
Here are some coupons.

34:46.320 --> 34:49.563
And we double them on Tuesday,
but I'm sure you already know that.

34:50.239 --> 34:53.050
So don't steal. It's wrong.

34:53.239 --> 34:57.005
But if you do steal,
don't steal from Value Town.

34:59.840 --> 35:01.683
Yeah, couple of great friends I got.

35:01.840 --> 35:03.763
You just made me an accomplice to a robbery.

35:03.920 --> 35:05.684
We never asked you to do anything.

35:05.840 --> 35:08.684
I drive you there. I drive you back.
That makes me a getaway driver.

35:08.840 --> 35:09.841
Oh, don't flatter yourself.

35:10.040 --> 35:12.520
You drive like my grandmother,
and she drove a horse and buggy.

35:12.680 --> 35:16.526
That's a good one.
Just for that you can walk home.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.967
Don't touch my car. Don't get in the car.

35:19.120 --> 35:20.804
You're not going to make us walk!

35:20.960 --> 35:22.086
Hell I'm not.

35:22.240 --> 35:25.050
Oh, boy. You guys are going to be
great bank robbers.

35:25.200 --> 35:28.124
You just got busted robbing Value Town!

35:28.280 --> 35:29.327
Oh-ho!

35:37.920 --> 35:40.651
I hate when he's right.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.484
We're going to need professional help.

35:42.720 --> 35:43.721
You think?

35:43.960 --> 35:48.284
Oh, yeah.
We might as well turn ourselves in now.

35:48.440 --> 35:51.569
You know any criminals?

35:51.720 --> 35:53.404
I know a lowlife.

36:13.440 --> 36:15.647
Uh... No habla Inglés.

36:15.800 --> 36:18.007
I know it's you, Murphy.

36:18.160 --> 36:20.766
What are you doing here, Joe?

36:20.920 --> 36:23.924
I've come about the child support
you're not paying.

36:24.080 --> 36:26.321
Didn't I lose you in the divorce, Joe?

36:26.480 --> 36:27.481
Hit the buzzer.

36:32.960 --> 36:34.689
"Maui Wowie."

36:34.880 --> 36:36.644
"Bad Bitch."

36:36.840 --> 36:38.444
"Blueberry Kush."

36:39.120 --> 36:40.485
"OG Kush."

36:40.640 --> 36:42.483
How is this legal?

36:42.640 --> 36:45.120
Gentlemen, prohibition is over.

36:45.280 --> 36:47.851
Marijuana has superior medical benefits.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.128
It's good for all kinds of situations.

36:50.280 --> 36:54.842
Anxiety, pain, seizures, stress.

36:55.000 --> 36:59.562
Anxiety, pain, seizures, stress.

36:59.720 --> 37:01.802
Anxiety, pain, seizures...

37:02.480 --> 37:04.130
What is your situation?

37:04.320 --> 37:06.243
Right now, anxiety.

37:06.400 --> 37:10.246
Listen, Joe, not to be uncool
to family and such.

37:10.400 --> 37:11.481
Ex-family.

37:11.640 --> 37:15.008
As you say. But, what do you
want from me, man?

37:15.160 --> 37:17.481
We have this project,
and we're looking for help.

37:18.040 --> 37:19.405
What kind of project?

37:19.560 --> 37:21.324
Oh, well, we'd rather not say.

37:21.480 --> 37:23.847
Well, that makes it harder
for me to help you.

37:24.000 --> 37:28.050
We need to find the type of people
who do bad things.

37:28.320 --> 37:31.881
What makes you think that
I would know people like that?

37:32.040 --> 37:33.929
I figured your kind move in the same circles.

37:34.080 --> 37:35.923
My kind? Entrepreneurs?

37:36.080 --> 37:39.163
No. Lowlifes. Deadbeats. Gangster types.

37:39.360 --> 37:41.522
See, I'm sure that you could point us

37:41.680 --> 37:43.444
in the right direction.

37:49.680 --> 37:50.681
What's wrong with him?

37:50.840 --> 37:51.921
He's thinking.

37:54.200 --> 37:55.440
Looks painful.

37:55.600 --> 37:58.524
I know it looks it,
but I've seen him do it before.

37:59.760 --> 38:01.046
It's the drugs, you know?

38:01.200 --> 38:02.565
Oh, yeah. Of course.

38:14.040 --> 38:15.883
Oh, this stupid bitch.

38:16.560 --> 38:19.040
I wish I could tase his old ass.

38:19.200 --> 38:21.885
Here comes an eggplant. Eggplant.

38:22.040 --> 38:23.041
Hey, you.

38:23.200 --> 38:24.281
- Hi, Annie.
- Hi!

38:24.440 --> 38:25.930
You're here every day.
Don't you get a day off?

38:26.080 --> 38:27.081
No, every day.

38:27.280 --> 38:29.248
- Man, tough schedule.
- Mmm.

38:30.240 --> 38:32.641
What are you going to do with this eggplant?

38:32.800 --> 38:34.325
I was thinking about a ratatouille.

38:35.240 --> 38:39.928
I like to slice it paper thin for parmesan.

38:40.080 --> 38:41.730
You know, it soaks up all the juices.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.081
Okay. Sounds good.

38:43.240 --> 38:45.561
You will never, ever taste a better one.

38:45.760 --> 38:46.761
I'm sure. Listen,

38:46.920 --> 38:49.321
I think you're sweet,
and I find you very attractive.

38:49.480 --> 38:51.084
- Oh, you think I'm attractive.
- You're a lovely person.

38:51.240 --> 38:53.163
I think that's wonderful.

38:53.320 --> 38:55.846
But you're not looking
for a relationship. Is that right?

38:56.000 --> 38:57.604
That's exactly right.

38:57.760 --> 39:00.923
Well, you have made that perfectly clear, Al.

39:01.080 --> 39:02.366
You want to have dinner some night?

39:03.440 --> 39:05.841
What do I have to do?
I just don't think you hear me!

39:06.000 --> 39:09.368
Oh, I hear you. I hear you real good.

39:09.520 --> 39:10.806
You know what I think?

39:10.960 --> 39:16.171
I think we owe it to ourselves to live
every single day that we have.

39:16.320 --> 39:20.484
I feel that I really want to
get to know you better.

39:20.640 --> 39:22.165
Share a meal with you.

39:23.640 --> 39:24.721
I...

39:25.480 --> 39:28.450
What? What is it, baby?

39:28.600 --> 39:29.965
I have a roommate.

39:31.480 --> 39:35.166
I have my own place.

39:46.640 --> 39:48.324
- Annie.
- Yeah?

39:49.040 --> 39:51.122
You make a hell of an eggplant parmesan.

39:51.320 --> 39:52.321
Thank you.

39:52.480 --> 39:53.481
World class.

39:53.640 --> 39:55.165
Thank you.

39:58.880 --> 40:02.362
Scrambled eggs, turkey sausage,
hash browns, toast and coffee, please.

40:02.520 --> 40:04.682
"Good morning, Mitzi.
Your hair looks nice today."

40:04.880 --> 40:06.723
"Did you get your hair cut?"
"Oh yeah, Al, I did."

40:06.920 --> 40:09.161
"And you know what I'm in the mood for?"
"I don't know, Al. What?"

40:09.320 --> 40:12.005
Mitzi, you look gorgeous.
You smell fantastic.

40:12.160 --> 40:14.686
Now go get me some food,
because I'm starving to death.

40:14.840 --> 40:17.161
All right. That's more like it.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.684
Didn't think you'd be joining us today.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.331
I'm too old for grudges.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.045
That never stopped you.

40:23.520 --> 40:25.727
Talk amongst yourselves.

40:26.680 --> 40:28.728
Oh! Here! It's in print!

40:28.880 --> 40:31.247
"Wechsler's pensioner's fund, and assets

40:32.200 --> 40:34.567
"to be distributed to current debtors."

40:35.200 --> 40:39.410
They're using our retirement money
to pay utility bills.

40:39.560 --> 40:42.530
And that isn't all. Check this.

40:42.880 --> 40:47.681
"Williamsburg Savings Bank will manage
the liquidation of the fund,

40:47.880 --> 40:50.884
"and the restructuring
of Wechsler's corporate debt."

40:51.040 --> 40:53.122
- That's my bank.
- That's my bank.

40:53.280 --> 40:54.725
That's my bank!

40:55.920 --> 40:57.888
They're stealing our goddamn pension!

40:58.040 --> 40:59.451
That's what it says.

40:59.640 --> 41:01.608
Forty years I worked for that
goddamn company,

41:01.760 --> 41:03.046
and now they're stealing our pension.

41:03.560 --> 41:04.891
Get it out of here. I'm not hungry.

41:05.040 --> 41:06.405
You want to take it home? For go?

41:06.560 --> 41:08.244
No! No, leave it here.

41:08.440 --> 41:09.885
Nobody's taking anything from me anymore.

41:10.040 --> 41:11.804
You know something, Al?
You're complicated today.

41:11.960 --> 41:13.405
I'm not coming back to your table.

41:13.560 --> 41:14.971
And no coins.

41:15.160 --> 41:16.446
I'm not a laundromat.

41:25.240 --> 41:28.244
I'm in. I want to rob that bank.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.160
It's as good a place as any.

41:34.080 --> 41:35.923
Well, how do we start?

41:36.080 --> 41:39.926
We get in touch with this fellow
that my ex-son-in-law deals with.

41:40.080 --> 41:41.764
Why is he going to help us?

41:41.920 --> 41:43.081
Because apparently

41:44.640 --> 41:48.087
this is the best weed in Brooklyn.

41:48.280 --> 41:49.930
Man, that's like a pillow.

41:50.080 --> 41:52.560
Yeah, but it's a pillow you can smoke.

41:52.720 --> 41:56.361
Gentlemen, let's go get our money back.

41:56.600 --> 41:57.601
Hear. Hear.

41:57.760 --> 41:58.921
Yeah!

42:16.240 --> 42:17.765
Why would I help you?

42:17.920 --> 42:20.082
25%. That's not chicken scratch.

42:21.160 --> 42:23.401
I could rob a bank on my own. Make 100%.

42:23.600 --> 42:25.284
I'm sure you can, but this is easy money.

42:25.480 --> 42:29.963
None of the risks. Only the reward.
You show us the ropes, you get paid.

42:30.480 --> 42:33.324
Murphy does it right! Shit right there.

42:35.480 --> 42:36.686
You five-oh?

42:38.480 --> 42:40.323
We're practically eight-oh.

42:50.360 --> 42:53.682
Now, I don't know you from Adam.

42:53.880 --> 42:56.008
How does Jesus know you're cool?

42:56.160 --> 42:57.286
No, we're cool.

43:03.800 --> 43:04.801
What's the matter?

43:05.840 --> 43:10.402
What do you think of these guys, huh?
What do you think?

43:10.560 --> 43:12.801
What do you think, huh? You tell me.

43:12.960 --> 43:14.325
Good or bad?

43:14.480 --> 43:15.481
Aw, can I hold him? Can I?

43:15.640 --> 43:16.880
Do you want to go with him?

43:17.720 --> 43:19.051
He says okay.

43:20.960 --> 43:22.849
He takes the whole bottle.

43:23.800 --> 43:25.370
Tiny little fella.

43:25.720 --> 43:28.326
I find this one in a drainage ditch.

43:28.480 --> 43:29.686
- No!
- Yeah.

43:29.840 --> 43:32.047
People have no heart these days.

43:32.200 --> 43:34.407
So what makes you think you can pull it off?

43:34.560 --> 43:38.167
Well, I don't know.
Thought we'd give it a go.

43:39.040 --> 43:42.203
"Well, I don't know.
We'll just give it a go."

43:42.360 --> 43:45.330
You could get life!
Which I guess for you, isn't that long.

43:45.480 --> 43:48.689
But you better think, old man,
and you better know.

43:48.840 --> 43:51.605
This is not sitting on a park bench
playing bingo.

43:51.760 --> 43:53.524
Listen, fella.

43:53.680 --> 43:56.684
I don't have to take shit from you.

43:56.840 --> 43:59.047
I get enough of this crap out there.

43:59.760 --> 44:02.764
In 20 days, I will not have
a roof over my head.

44:02.920 --> 44:07.403
My social security check is a joke
and my pension is tits up.

44:08.040 --> 44:11.362
Us three are going to go through with it.
We are going to go through with it.

44:11.520 --> 44:14.091
If you want to make 25% helping us,
that's fine.

44:14.240 --> 44:15.241
But if you don't

44:15.400 --> 44:17.562
keep the bullshit to yourself!

44:20.040 --> 44:22.042
That was a good speech, bro.

44:23.520 --> 44:24.726
You going to help us?

44:29.160 --> 44:30.161
Mañana.

44:33.240 --> 44:34.446
Uh...

44:34.800 --> 44:37.883
You got any snacks?

44:41.040 --> 44:42.485
- Willie?
- Huh?

44:42.960 --> 44:45.770
I love the feeling of the air on my face.

44:45.920 --> 44:46.921
Me too.

44:47.120 --> 44:50.920
Oh, my God! Look out.
We got little baby junkies here.

44:51.120 --> 44:54.647
I think I'll get a prescription for this.

44:54.800 --> 44:56.609
- Me too.
- Heh.

45:11.800 --> 45:14.963
This food is excellent tonight.

45:15.120 --> 45:16.451
They must've changed recipes.

45:16.600 --> 45:19.365
Same crap. You got the munchies.

45:19.520 --> 45:20.806
Hey. You mind?

45:20.960 --> 45:21.961
Take 'em both.

45:22.120 --> 45:23.326
Okay.

45:24.800 --> 45:28.202
How much time do you think
you've got, Willie?

45:31.680 --> 45:32.681
I don't know.

45:32.840 --> 45:34.604
Take a guess.

45:35.840 --> 45:37.046
Two, three years?

45:37.200 --> 45:40.443
That's it? You look great!

45:41.800 --> 45:44.041
Just a feeling. You asked.

45:45.200 --> 45:46.326
What about you?

45:46.480 --> 45:50.041
Oh, I'd guess, uh, seven years.

45:51.680 --> 45:53.205
What about you, Al?

45:53.360 --> 45:55.840
I have bad luck.
I'll probably live to be 100.

45:57.480 --> 45:59.005
Then you can do both eulogies.

45:59.160 --> 46:00.207
Got it.

46:00.400 --> 46:03.847
So that's 27 years total.

46:04.000 --> 46:08.369
Our pensions average 45,000 dollars a year.

46:13.320 --> 46:20.044
1,215,000 dollars is what we withdraw
from the bank.

46:20.200 --> 46:23.568
Hey, hey, hey! What if we get more?

46:23.720 --> 46:25.210
We give it to charity.

46:25.360 --> 46:28.409
Yeah, but what if we get less?
I'm not going to go through this twice.

46:32.040 --> 46:33.883
Hey! That's our bank right there.

46:34.040 --> 46:35.690
Wait a second,
you're going to rob your own bank?

46:35.840 --> 46:37.001
It's personal.

46:37.160 --> 46:39.208
Okay. We skip lesson number one.

46:39.400 --> 46:41.050
What was lesson number one?

46:41.200 --> 46:43.043
Never rob your own bank.

46:43.200 --> 46:45.441
We'll move on to lesson two then.

46:45.600 --> 46:48.843
I've got 20 days before I lose my house.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.525
Robbing a bank is an art form.

46:50.680 --> 46:54.241
Ten different people will take
the same place ten different ways.

46:55.080 --> 46:59.085
You need to come up with a plan
that is special for you.

47:16.760 --> 47:19.445
Cameras aquí, aquí.

47:19.600 --> 47:20.840
One entrance.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.411
One emergency exit.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.765
The right getaway car is very important.

47:26.080 --> 47:27.764
Find something they'll never suspect.

47:37.600 --> 47:38.886
Just put 'em together like this.

47:39.080 --> 47:40.286
Uh-huh.

47:40.440 --> 47:41.771
Magic.

47:49.760 --> 47:50.761
Good.

47:50.960 --> 47:52.450
You have to be in great physical shape.

47:53.640 --> 47:55.961
Now I realize you guys are 4,000 years old.

47:56.120 --> 47:57.610
That is fabulous.

47:57.760 --> 48:01.288
But under those masks, you're going
to need to feel like you're 20.

48:01.480 --> 48:02.606
Wait! Wait! Wait!

48:11.080 --> 48:12.809
Now this is crucial.

48:12.960 --> 48:15.247
You have to have a solid alibi.

48:15.400 --> 48:16.890
Wednesday the 15th?

48:17.080 --> 48:18.730
That's the lodge fundraiser.

48:18.880 --> 48:20.484
Solid alibi.

48:20.960 --> 48:24.760
Do we have any volunteers
for the T-shirt committee?

48:26.000 --> 48:28.401
Please put your hands down in back.

48:28.560 --> 48:32.849
We're trying to see if there are
volunteers for the T-shirt committee.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.924
We are volunteering, Milton.

48:39.840 --> 48:41.080
All right.

48:43.720 --> 48:48.169
Each teller's drawer is equipped
with dye packs and tracing devices.

48:48.360 --> 48:50.442
Now, they'll give you one if they can,

48:50.600 --> 48:52.807
but they will never endanger lives to do it.

49:15.040 --> 49:18.044
The average police response time
to a robbery in progress

49:18.200 --> 49:20.567
is between two and four minutes,

49:20.720 --> 49:22.643
depending on how near a unit is to the scene

49:22.800 --> 49:26.009
and how many other police calls
are in the vicinity.

49:28.040 --> 49:29.405
Everything's on the damn Internet.

49:29.560 --> 49:32.530
Set your stopwatches to two minutes.

49:32.880 --> 49:35.008
And walk it like it's the real deal.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.923
4 minutes, 54 seconds.

49:52.080 --> 49:55.562
Right now, you would all be in the back
of a cop car.

49:59.720 --> 50:03.167
Your guns are only there
for the worst-case scenario.

50:03.320 --> 50:06.005
You need to know how to shoot,

50:06.160 --> 50:08.606
but the last thing you want to do
is shoot anybody.

50:08.760 --> 50:09.761
Who's on the door?

50:09.920 --> 50:12.207
I'll handle that. Stand guard. Keep watch.

50:12.400 --> 50:13.686
You know how to handle a gun?

50:28.600 --> 50:32.090
The more you practice, the better you'll be.

50:32.960 --> 50:34.450
And come showtime,

50:35.360 --> 50:38.523
you will stroll out of that bank
with more money

50:38.720 --> 50:40.370
than you've ever seen.

50:41.920 --> 50:43.251
Piece of cake.

50:46.120 --> 50:48.600
Maybe the cops will be slow.

50:58.560 --> 51:01.131
Attica! Attica! Attica!

51:01.280 --> 51:03.647
Attica! Attica!

51:06.480 --> 51:08.164
I don't want to watch the ending.

51:09.440 --> 51:11.283
Yeah, that didn't work out too well.

51:13.400 --> 51:15.050
How can he sleep?

51:15.920 --> 51:17.410
He's getting laid.

51:17.560 --> 51:18.561
Oh, yeah.

51:19.320 --> 51:21.084
I remember what that was like.

51:26.160 --> 51:27.161
You feeling good?

51:28.160 --> 51:30.561
Yeah. Yeah. Good as gold.

51:32.160 --> 51:33.889
Me too.

51:36.880 --> 51:38.120
Nobody's going to get hurt.

51:38.440 --> 51:40.090
That's right.

51:43.040 --> 51:44.610
We get into trouble, we're out of there.

51:44.760 --> 51:46.125
That's right. Yeah.

51:46.320 --> 51:48.846
Cops come, we lay down.

51:49.040 --> 51:50.326
Hands in the air.

51:51.080 --> 51:52.161
Two minutes tops.

51:52.320 --> 51:54.129
Tops. Give or take.

52:06.600 --> 52:08.523
Get some sleep, young man.

52:08.680 --> 52:12.446
All right. You too, young man.

53:12.280 --> 53:16.330
Don't let the omelet touch the fruit.
She likes a separation.

53:16.480 --> 53:17.720
You do this every day?

53:17.920 --> 53:19.126
- Every day.
- No shit.

53:19.280 --> 53:20.361
Yes shit.

53:21.200 --> 53:23.043
I wish my dad did this for me.

53:23.200 --> 53:24.565
So does your daughter.

53:25.720 --> 53:28.291
What are you doing here?

53:28.440 --> 53:30.408
He's making Brook's breakfast.

53:30.600 --> 53:33.410
I see that. Why?

53:33.600 --> 53:36.843
I'm training him.
He's making an effort to be a father.

53:39.720 --> 53:42.485
Good morning.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.484
Your father made you breakfast.

53:44.640 --> 53:45.687
Holy shit!

53:45.840 --> 53:47.285
- Easy!
- Language.

53:47.440 --> 53:48.680
Sorry.

53:49.520 --> 53:52.649
Your father will be picking you up today.

53:53.720 --> 53:55.643
Did he find Jesus or something?

53:55.800 --> 53:59.964
Doubtful. He's figured out
how much he's missing.

54:00.400 --> 54:02.289
Yeah, this week.

54:02.880 --> 54:05.406
He's just not much with the follow-through.

54:05.560 --> 54:08.723
Give him a shot, babe. For me.

54:08.880 --> 54:12.407
Sure, Joe.
But only because you're my best friend.

54:14.320 --> 54:15.765
I love you, kiddo.

54:16.680 --> 54:17.920
You're going to do it all.

54:19.160 --> 54:20.889
What's going with you today?

54:21.040 --> 54:22.644
Do you have cancer or something?

54:23.120 --> 54:25.805
No! No, no. I'm as strong as an ox.

54:25.960 --> 54:26.961
Okay.

54:27.120 --> 54:28.531
It's carnival day. Lots to do.

54:28.680 --> 54:30.523
Yes. I'm coming right after school.

54:30.680 --> 54:34.401
Yup, and I'm going to bring you
fried dough with your name on it.

54:38.960 --> 54:42.442
Okay. That's a little tight there.
I love you too.

54:46.120 --> 54:48.805
Go make something of yourself.

54:49.560 --> 54:50.925
I will, young man.

54:51.480 --> 54:52.481
See you later,

54:52.840 --> 54:53.841
Dad.

55:12.520 --> 55:16.081
I've been giving you crap
for a long time, Murphy.

55:17.080 --> 55:19.447
I guess I deserve it. Mostly.

55:19.600 --> 55:22.126
That's one of the smartest things
you ever said.

55:24.920 --> 55:26.126
Listen, Joe.

55:26.280 --> 55:29.409
Whatever it is you're doing,
you don't have to do it.

55:30.400 --> 55:31.811
There's always another way.

55:31.960 --> 55:36.443
My business is my business, kid.
Forget that you know it.

55:36.640 --> 55:39.325
And if in the end,
I don't come back, it's on you.

55:39.520 --> 55:43.081
I can't cover for you anymore.

55:43.240 --> 55:45.129
You're her father.

55:45.320 --> 55:48.608
You got to step up to the plate.
Act like a man.

55:49.600 --> 55:51.489
Even if you have to fake it.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.331
All right.

56:08.320 --> 56:11.403
Okay, gents. Let's mingle.

56:28.440 --> 56:30.408
Three in a row wins a prize!

56:34.520 --> 56:37.251
Hello, Paulie. Hot enough for you?

56:37.400 --> 56:39.607
Perfect day for it.

56:39.760 --> 56:41.683
I've got to check in at the ticket office.

56:41.960 --> 56:44.361
Well, be good.

56:44.520 --> 56:47.046
I won't be good. But I will be careful.

56:51.400 --> 56:54.483
Okay, here you go. Thank you.

56:57.720 --> 56:59.449
You folks are popular.

56:59.640 --> 57:02.325
Yeah. It's the cocaine.

57:03.560 --> 57:04.800
You've got cocaine?

57:04.960 --> 57:06.291
That was a joke, Milton.

57:06.480 --> 57:09.484
Oh, okay, very funny.

57:09.640 --> 57:12.166
Hang here for one minute.
I got to go to the karaoke thing.

57:12.600 --> 57:15.206
I can't. I got to check in
to the cotton candy booth.

57:15.360 --> 57:17.567
Milton, that's where you are right now.

57:19.080 --> 57:21.401
It's okay. You're better off not knowing.

57:24.760 --> 57:28.287
We're closed. We're out of cocaine.

57:28.520 --> 57:30.010
Go away.

57:30.160 --> 57:31.969
Beat it.

57:43.080 --> 57:45.731
Be careful in there.
Lots of monsters, you know.

57:46.240 --> 57:47.287
Be very careful.

57:47.480 --> 57:49.209
All right, watch your step.

57:52.280 --> 57:54.442
I'm going in, Sam.

57:56.440 --> 57:58.044
- Where did they go?
- I don't know!

57:58.240 --> 57:59.241
I thought you had 'em!

58:08.720 --> 58:11.530
I decided we should use blanks.

58:11.680 --> 58:14.081
No one needs to get hurt by accident.

58:14.240 --> 58:16.288
Well, it's just us now, kids.

58:16.440 --> 58:17.965
Fellas,

58:18.120 --> 58:22.409
it's been a real hell of a time
planning a heist with you.

58:24.720 --> 58:27.246
Can't think of two people
I'd rather have done it with.

58:27.440 --> 58:29.169
Hear. Hear.

58:29.920 --> 58:31.570
Ditto.

59:04.040 --> 59:05.405
Ladies and gentlemen...

59:07.280 --> 59:08.725
This is an actual robbery.

59:09.200 --> 59:11.043
Kiss the ground. Don't breathe.

59:11.200 --> 59:12.725
Don't move. Don't touch the silent alarm

59:12.880 --> 59:14.962
unless you like bullets
flying around your head.

59:15.880 --> 59:17.450
Hit the dirt, big guy!

59:17.600 --> 59:18.601
Put that gun away.

59:18.840 --> 59:21.923
Okay, folks, we'll be out of your lives
in two minutes.

59:23.120 --> 59:24.610
Get moving, Blue Eyes.

59:24.760 --> 59:25.807
Here we go.

59:26.040 --> 59:28.884
All tellers, please stand up
and open your windows.

59:33.840 --> 59:34.841
Ten seconds.

59:37.960 --> 59:40.247
No dye packs, no tracers.

59:40.400 --> 59:43.729
You got me, see? No tracers,
no dye packs, no funny business.

59:43.880 --> 59:45.211
Yes, Mr. Sinatra.

59:46.960 --> 59:48.291
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

59:48.480 --> 59:49.845
20 seconds.

59:52.240 --> 59:53.287
Thank you.

59:53.680 --> 59:54.681
Here you go, ma'am.

59:54.840 --> 59:56.046
No funny business.
Do you know what that means?

59:56.320 --> 59:57.321
I do. I do.

59:57.520 --> 59:59.124
All of it, son.

59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.091
30 seconds.

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.405
Give me everything you've got.

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.042
You can have her, mister.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.206
40 seconds.

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.326
Hey! Stick to the plan.

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.761
All units, all units report
to Williamsburg Savings Bank.

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:29.810
We have a robbery in progress.
Repeat, we have a 10-30...

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:31.681
One minute!

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.843
I don't want to take your doll, sweetheart.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.041
You know, when my granddaughter
was your age, she had one just like it.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.406
What's her name?

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:41.291
Okay, honey. This man has a job to do.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.204
His job's robbing banks?

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:46.967
No, sweetheart.
Just trying to see my family more often.

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.289
Light-headed...

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.120
What's happening?

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:58.890
You okay, mister?

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:01.006
Going to need a little help.

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.608
He's going to need a little help.

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:05.006
Jesus Christ!

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:08.681
I'll get him.

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:09.841
Stay put.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.081
Oh, my God!

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.287
Lucy!

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:16.448
His mask's too hot for him.

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:20.685
Thank you, sweetheart. Thank you.

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:24.330
I can't breathe when I wear masks, neither.

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:25.766
You're so sweet.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.561
Two minutes.

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.680
What the hell's going on?

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.370
Can you make it out of here?

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:41.521
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:43.841
It's now or never, kid.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.240
You stay in school, kiddo.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.126
And don't rob banks, you hear me?

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:48.281
Come on!

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:49.481
Hurry!

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:54.800
This is my bank!

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:56.564
Are you crazy?

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.609
- Freeze!
- Me freeze?

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:01.047
You don't tell me to freeze. You freeze!

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.168
I'm not going to be a victim anymore.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.484
Tell them to freeze too.

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.369
They can hear you just fine.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:08.521
What's the plan now?

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:09.886
I'm working on one.

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.366
Put your hands up

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.522
and drop the money.

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.809
Okay, in three seconds,
I'm going to shoot you.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.001
You're going to do what?

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.366
I'll shoot back!

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:20.601
That's your plan?

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:21.807
One!

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.161
Two!

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.730
Next number's three!

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.120
I can count.

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:31.203
He's going to bloody shoot us.

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.044
Three!

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:50.925
You're a shit shot, pal.

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.962
Now you're going to meet your maker.

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:56.128
Oh, my God!

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:02.330
Oh, my God!

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:05.006
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:08.081
Oh, my God!

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.601
Those were blanks, you dipshit.

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:18.760
Okay, folks. Count to 90
out loud and backward.

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:21.730
And don't stand up until you get there.

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:23.370
Start counting!

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:26.569
90, 89, 88, 87, 86...

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.450
Ah!

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:40.841
What's going on, Willie?

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.884
Nothing. I just got a little overwhelmed,
that's all. I'm good.

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:45.485
That was a hell of a time for a panic attack!

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:46.641
I'm sorry.

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:48.046
No need for that. We made it.

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:49.247
Hard part's over.

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:52.290
Now's the time for the grand finale.

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.161
Taxi! Taxi!

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:19.685
All right.

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.605
Astoria, Queens, please.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.403
He's not going to stop anytime soon.

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:01.450
He'll eventually pass out.

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:08.521
Gentlemen,

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:10.409
can I interest you in dessert?

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.369
What kind of pie do you have?

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:16.366
We have Key lime,
vegan pumpkin, cherry-mango...

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.284
A slice of each.

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:20.044
And more champagne.

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:21.406
Yeah, more champagne.

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.007
Champagne it is.

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:57.681
Whoa, no more booze for you.

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.605
Steady there, lightweight.

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:02.125
It's not the booze.

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:05.563
What? Wait, it's not the booze?

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:09.164
Hey! Can you please
call an ambulance? Please?

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:11.845
Where does it hurt, Willie?

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:14.324
Everywhere.

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:16.521
Oh, God.

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:18.250
Oh, shit.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.401
Pull him up. It's wet.

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.891
Call an ambulance!

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:25.686
It just happened so quickly.

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:29.402
Zoom in.

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:32.489
Freeze frame there.

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.011
African-American?

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:36.161
Appears so.

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:39.449
Got to be at least late 60's.

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:41.651
Get stills of the others.

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:44.446
I want them plastered everywhere.

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:47.004
He never talked about this?

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.161
Not a peep.

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:51.249
He holds things very close to the vest.

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.442
He's very tight emotionally.

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:54.921
Well...

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:56.805
Willie's in full renal failure.

01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:59.440
He needs a kidney transplant.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:00.681
Or what?

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:04.523
Uh, let's just say,
he won't leave here without one.

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:06.887
They must have been very young and nimble.

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:09.845
I fired a barrage of shots at them,

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:12.611
and they were able to evade all the bullets.

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:14.808
I've been on the job for a month now,

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:17.531
and the bank has been robbed twice.

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.967
So, I think I'm going to go back
to my job as a barista,

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.248
where I'm less likely to be shot.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:25.404
All I can say is, thank God for me!

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:27.887
It was a day of heroism for me.

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:29.121
Hey!

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:32.961
We're famous.

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:34.884
Better. We're infamous.

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.930
Keep it down. We're not out of the woods yet.

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:42.723
So, what's going on, Willie?

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:45.167
You don't come to us,
you don't tell us you're sick.

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:47.800
We're your friends, man. We're all you got.

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:50.645
It's my business, guys.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.290
Your business? Your business.

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:55.330
Talk to him, Joe. I can't...
You're a selfish old bastard.

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:01.847
I don't get it, Will.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.162
I would have given you my kidney last week.

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.684
Yours is probably no good.

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:09.842
I still would've given it to you.

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:17.367
We're friends, Willie.

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:20.126
We're supposed to look after
each other, aren't we?

01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:23.846
Well, let us do it. Okay?

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:34.439
The suspects are armed, dangerous,

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:37.888
and possibly in their late 60's
or early 70's.

01:08:38.479 --> 01:08:39.890
They were disguised as the Rat Pack,

01:08:41.319 --> 01:08:44.163
Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra,
and Sammy Davis Jr.

01:08:45.479 --> 01:08:46.481
Let's get out of here.

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:50.127
The FBI has just released
this surveillance video of the robbery.

01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:53.886
If you have any information,
please call the number on our screen.

01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:01.484
I knew it. I knew when
I saw that bank surveillance.

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:03.881
Same height, same weight.

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:06.245
A lot of people fit that bill.

01:09:06.399 --> 01:09:08.163
Yeah, but who runs like that?

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.564
We're going to need a copy of this.

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:21.404
Got one right here. Uh-uh.

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:23.410
I believe there's a reward.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:24.720
A reward?

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:27.770
Yeah. I need the money.
My grandma got locked up last night.

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.251
You know how it is, right, brother?

01:09:45.439 --> 01:09:47.283
- Annie.
- Yeah.

01:09:47.439 --> 01:09:48.930
I have to talk to you.

01:09:50.479 --> 01:09:52.209
I lost this tooth last week.

01:09:52.359 --> 01:09:53.600
Did the tooth fairy come?

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:54.761
He brought me five dollars.

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:57.361
Five... You're kidding.

01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:59.443
You know the most I ever got was a quarter?

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.046
You can't buy anything with quarters
anymore, Grandpa.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:03.281
Tell me about it.

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:05.610
- Willie?
- Huh?

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.250
These men are with the FBI.

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.404
The FBI?

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.962
Must be bringing me a kidney.

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:24.320
Strike three! You're out!

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:25.561
Way to go, kiddo.

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:26.926
Yes!

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:28.730
That's my girl!

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:45.009
Hey! I've got to go and find a bathroom.

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:46.810
All right, man.

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.323
That was awesome, Brook.

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:21.285
Well, here's what I think.

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:24.125
Old man finds himself
in the middle of a bank robbery,

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.850
and he gets his juices flowing.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.890
And he thinks to himself,

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.280
"I could rob a bank.

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.201
"I'm smart.

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:34.567
"I've got nothing to lose.

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:36.370
"What's the worst that can end up happening?

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.688
"I can end up spending
the last years of my life

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:42.049
"in some country club style prison,
rent-free."

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:44.043
You go to school for that?

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:49.403
Well, Mr. Garner,

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:53.246
we seem to be missing
one hour of your existence.

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:56.563
Between 2:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m.

01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:59.690
The same hour that three elderly gentlemen

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:03.925
robbed 2.3 million dollars from
the Williamsburg Savings Bank.

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:06.731
Wow, that's some hefty payday.

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:11.770
You were working the haunted house ride
between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.?

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:13.001
That's what I said.

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:15.085
And you never left that ride?

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:18.005
Only to go inside. Scare the kids.

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:22.609
I got up, like I always do. 6:00 a.m.

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:25.084
I walked my granddaughter to school.

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.010
Like I do every day.

01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:31.404
Well, it's a fairly new relationship,
so we spend a lot of time together.

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:35.849
Let's see, first thing in the morning,
we made love twice.

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:39.931
No.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:41.121
Three times.

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:43.561
And that was it.

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.440
Annie Santori.

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:50.123
And then, we got up. I made pancakes...

01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:52.248
And then, I got dressed.

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:55.290
Got dressed. Had breakfast at Nat's.

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:56.521
I go there...

01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:59.121
Couple of times a week at least.

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:01.282
For years. He's a regular.

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:05.087
You seeing anybody?

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:07.129
I'm married with two kids.

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.971
Well, take my number. Things happen.

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:12.450
I got dressed.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:15.485
I gathered the tickets for the ride booth.

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:17.642
I'm on that committee for the fundraiser.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:20.645
All right, boys, good luck to us all.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.731
Time to get in the bag.

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:25.160
Got to the park around 2:00 p.m.

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:27.641
Talked to my friend Paul for a few minutes,

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:30.320
then ran one of the ticket booths.

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:31.961
Hi, Tony.

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:33.167
Good afternoon.

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:34.446
I've got you a souvenir.

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:36.842
Oh, thanks, Joe. I needed a hat.

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:39.481
And that's where I was
for most of the carnival.

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:42.001
You can ask anyone who bought a ticket.

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:43.764
They'll tell you they got it
from a handsome old gent

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.251
in a gray flat cap.

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:51.525
Then we went to the fair, and I was
at the cotton candy stand till 2:00,

01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:54.126
and then Mr. Milton Kupchak relieved me.

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:57.011
Al was there all day.

01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:58.531
At 2:30 p.m.?

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.445
- Who?
- Al?

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:01.601
Garner?

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:03.007
Yes.

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:04.286
He's here?

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.683
You know, in the cotton candy booth,

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:12.611
he tried to sell me cocaine.

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:15.686
And I'm prepared to testify.

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:17.644
Kids love the haunted house.

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:30.123
Frankenstein's one of their favorites.

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.567
Must have been in there over an hour.

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:47.846
Yes, I've had stomach issues for years
from all the drinking I used to do.

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:49.924
It's called diverticulitis,

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:54.005
and the doctor says I should probably
have a section of my colon removed.

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:55.571
I don't really like that idea.

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:21.922
So from 2:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., give or take,

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:23.690
you were

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:26.771
going to the bathroom?

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:27.967
Yes.

01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:31.602
It's very tedious, but I keep
reading material with me all the time.

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.769
Helps pass the time.

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.807
After that, I found my lady friend,

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:39.884
and we rehearsed our karaoke performance.

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.646
Then what happens?

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:14.651
Oh, my God!

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:17.641
Look out!

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:28.531
Would you mind washing
this dirty laundry for me?

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:29.681
You got it.

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:56.488
Altogether, it was a lovely day
at the carnival.

01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.210
Hit me with your best shot.

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:06.081
Oh!

01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:16.010
Wow! Pretty solid story, Mr. Harding.

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:19.086
The truth is easy to remember.

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:24.091
Yeah. It was almost perfect.

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:27.686
Except let me tell you
a little something about criminals.

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:32.648
They always make one stupid mistake

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:35.691
that ends up screwing up the whole plan.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:41.567
I'm going to need you
to take a ride with me, Harding.

01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:24.051
Okay, guys, let's go.
Clear the gym. Official business.

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:25.247
Come on, man. What the hell?

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:26.481
Out the back door there.

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:29.490
All right. Folks, come up.
Hurry up, let's go.

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:43.360
Let's go. Let's go.

01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:50.930
Right over here. Line them up.

01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:30.609
I want you to start with that man
over there, okay?

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:33.127
Get a good look at his face.

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:03.964
I don't see him.

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:06.321
What?

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:08.925
He's not here.

01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:11.521
Are you sure?

01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:13.006
Yep. I'm positive.

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:16.607
I got a great memory.

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:23.686
Hey! You want to have another look?

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:25.330
Not really.

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:30.005
Can I go home now?

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.331
Yeah.

01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:20.921
Oh,

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:23.364
I thought you might not be coming.

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:25.204
Well, here I am.

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:30.522
So, what's good here, Joey?

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:32.045
Nothing, really.

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:33.361
Why do you come?

01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:35.170
I like bad coffee.

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:36.970
Yes. This I understand.

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:39.522
He has all his shots.

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:43.167
Rabies, distemper, Bordetella.
He's been neutered.

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:45.049
All the papers are in the proper order.

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:46.326
You take your cut?

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:49.410
No. Not from you.

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:54.047
It is a culture's duty
to take care of its elderly.

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:59.723
It is a culture's duty
to take care of its elderly.

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:05.211
Where's the tattoo?

01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:10.490
Henna, mi amigo.

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:15.646
Show the person with the worst eyes
an image he can't forget.

01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:19.681
The policía will be spinning
around for years.

01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:22.411
That looks like a gang tattoo to me.

01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:25.251
If we can find this artist,
then we can find our perp.

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:27.524
Very impressive.

01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:29.409
Eh, it's a tragedy.

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:38.569
FBI. Behind you. Six o'clock.

01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:43.444
Agent Hamer,

01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:46.049
would you like a bad coffee?

01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:52.084
I'm a soy latte man, Mr. Harding.
I'm lactose intolerant.

01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:54.969
You left that behind at evidence.

01:23:57.960 --> 01:23:59.530
How did you find me?

01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:01.563
Well, that's what I do.

01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:03.046
I find people.

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:11.125
This is my friend, Jesus.

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:13.563
He fosters dogs.

01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:15.722
Special Agent Hamer, FBI.

01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:18.326
Jesus Garcia. Queens.

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:25.329
Are you adopting a puppy, Mr. Harding?

01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:27.562
Yes, yeah. It's for my granddaughter.

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:29.802
She made the honor roll at school.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.081
That's great.

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:34.242
I love puppies.

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:35.640
You mind?

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:37.126
Uh, he might be sleeping.

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:39.760
That's okay. I won't wake him.

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:43.165
Oh, good heavens,
aren't you just the cutest little thing?

01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:45.800
Let me get a look at you
with your smushy face.

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:50.165
When I was just a kid,
I grew up with Border Collies.

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:53.449
Oh, now that's a great breed.
I just love Border Collies.

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:56.365
Yeah, they're wonderful.

01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:58.966
Yeah, come here, little guy.

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:02.521
He's a cute little fella.

01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:06.162
Attaboy, come here. Come here, little fella.

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:07.850
Yeah, come over here.

01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:10.241
Ah!

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.842
You little son of a bitch.

01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:16.681
Oh, be careful there. He's teething.

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.041
Yeah.

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:19.531
You have to watch his little razor blades.

01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:20.681
Thanks.

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:22.610
We don't want you to bleed to death.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.050
I got to get this little guy
back to the house

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:31.202
before my granddaughter gets out of school.

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.044
What a nice surprise for her.

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:34.725
It'll knock her socks off.

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:37.042
Do you have a dog now, Agent Hamer?

01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:38.804
No. It's my job.

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:40.849
Long hours.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.365
I couldn't do that to an animal.

01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:45.524
All right. Let's get
this little fella to his new home.

01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:55.250
You boys are killing me with these quar...

01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:07.767
Someone just dropped off this present.

01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:12.241
Whoa!

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:18.688
Big piece.

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.365
Cut them up.

01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:30.766
"Everyone deserves a piece of the pie."

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:47.561
Ow!

01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:50.371
Sorry, Mr. Garner.

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:52.291
Thought you were tougher than that.

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:53.441
I'm not tough.

01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:55.483
I'm a very sensitive person.

01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:57.770
I'm going to be honest with you.

01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:00.088
I don't really want to die today.

01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.327
That's a new one.

01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:04.643
But, if I do, I just want to say

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:08.168
that you've been a terrific roommate
and friend for...

01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:10.481
25 years.

01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:13.287
25 years? It's been that long?

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:15.283
Seems like 25 days, doesn't it?

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:16.487
Yeah, it does.

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:18.483
Underwater.

01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:20.251
Good one.

01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:23.131
All right, gentlemen. Here we go.

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:32.491
They say in life...

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:34.011
Come here!

01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:38.848
...ifyou're lucky,
you get a couple of great friends.

01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:43.846
The people who are right with you to the end.

01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:48.968
You grow old together,
see it all together, do it all together,

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:52.329
laugh and cry together.

01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:56.329
Al Garner was one of those guys for me.

01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:02.526
There will not be many men like him.

01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:06.321
Willing to risk all for others.

01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:08.721
Give you a kind word

01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:10.211
or a kidney.

01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:12.840
And complain about it every step of the way.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:14.047
That's you.

01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:16.282
That's not altogether true.

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:20.600
- Annie.
- Yes.

01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:21.886
He's your problem now.

01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:23.041
Thanks.

01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:28.047
Good luck. May you enjoy every minute
of every moment you have.

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:29.241
We love you.

01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:31.689
We love you too, young man.

01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:33.171
Cheers! Cheers, everyone.

01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:34.321
Cheers!

01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:36.448
Let's give it up for the wedding party!

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:23.090
I'm gonna revise my estimate, Joey.

01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:24.730
How's that?

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:27.443
I may be around another 20 years.

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:29.523
Not with Al's kidney.

01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:31.967
That's 10 years, tops.

01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:33.884
Close enough. I'll take it.

01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:36.404
Here he comes.

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:38.121
What's the matter?

01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:41.966
My face is killing me.
I never had to smile so much in my life.

01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:44.805
So? What's it like?

01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:46.200
What's what like?

01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:48.926
Being married, dummy.

01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:51.560
I don't know how any of this happened.

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:54.564
I mean, I don't even remember proposing.

01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:58.964
I mean, I feel like a raccoon
caught in a bear trap with one leg stuck.

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:01.606
She's a terrific person.

01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:04.001
I mean, she's sexy, we get it on.

01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:06.322
She's a great cook.

01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:08.482
She likes me the way I am.

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:10.847
I don't even like me the way I am.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.241
Everything is terrific,
but I got to tell you,

01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:17.769
I'm experiencing this very odd feeling.
I think it might be happiness.

01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:23.282
Cheers! Your glass is officially full.
