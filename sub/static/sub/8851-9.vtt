Previously, on AMC's <i>Hell On Wheels</i>...

00:03.615 --> 00:04.814
There's something stuck.

00:04.840 --> 00:06.939
- It's a norwegian penny.
- Mr. Swede.

00:06.965 --> 00:10.465
I'm Mr. Durant's wife.
You're dangerously behind schedule.

00:10.490 --> 00:12.890
It ain't my fault that you
oversold our mileage.

00:12.915 --> 00:15.815
How does Bohannon know?
Did you lay with him?

00:15.840 --> 00:17.740
Mickey saw you together!

00:17.765 --> 00:19.365
Sean, you're scaring me.

00:19.690 --> 00:22.290
Why do you hide your
breeding, Mr. Bohannon?

00:22.315 --> 00:24.415
You can't just push me out.

00:24.440 --> 00:26.340
Mr. Durant offered me a new job

00:26.365 --> 00:27.565
you ain't gonna like at all.

along with a letter from Mrs.
Lillian Bell several days ago.

the Senate Committee on Railroads."

[People yelling]

01:16.267 --> 01:18.437
Sir?
Can you hear me?

01:22.910 --> 01:25.277
We're trying to
establish the connection

01:25.312 --> 01:27.946
between the corruption
of this railroad

01:27.981 --> 01:30.681
and its near total decimation.

01:35.856 --> 01:39.460
Sir, we're just trying to
understand what happened here.

03:53.527 --> 03:55.362
Pl-please.

03:56.465 --> 03:58.298
Mr. Durant, let's
get you out of here.

03:58.333 --> 03:59.533
I've run out of medicine!

03:59.567 --> 04:01.033
I've got some here in my purse.

04:13.978 --> 04:15.913
Oh, God.

04:17.148 --> 04:21.954
I was just trying to steal
medicine from a cripple.

04:21.988 --> 04:24.555
The pain must be awful.

04:24.589 --> 04:27.091
You'll feel better.

04:27.126 --> 04:30.397
Yes, I'll feel better...

04:30.431 --> 04:33.297
Then I won't care what happens.

04:34.464 --> 04:37.968
This whole enterprise will
collapse on our heads.

04:38.003 --> 04:40.472
Don't say that.

04:40.506 --> 04:44.309
Everything's been a blur
since I was shot.

04:46.013 --> 04:49.315
It's all going to end in disaster.

05:07.299 --> 05:09.733
There you are.

05:13.074 --> 05:15.608
I'm gonna drive a train
across the bridge tomorrow

05:15.643 --> 05:17.343
you helped build...

05:19.313 --> 05:21.685
Come out and watch.

05:21.719 --> 05:25.522
I'm a freight clerk now.

05:25.557 --> 05:28.527
[Sighs] It's humiliating.

05:28.563 --> 05:29.932

05:29.966 --> 05:31.801

The past ain't the past
if it don't exist.

05:51.795 --> 05:54.630
Did you go to university, too?

05:55.633 --> 05:58.303
Some.

06:00.406 --> 06:02.640
Did you like me better
when I was stupid?

06:02.675 --> 06:06.113
I liked you better when
I thought I knew you.

06:06.147 --> 06:10.584
Lily, all I got right now
is this job and you.

06:16.920 --> 06:22.856
Your doctor in Chicago gave them
to me in case of hard birthing.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.792
I'll order you some more.

06:25.827 --> 06:31.401
Uh, Mrs. Durant, he... he was
a little out of his head.

06:32.837 --> 06:34.438
Was there a scene?

06:35.272 --> 06:37.873
He isn't well, ma'am.

06:41.375 --> 06:42.742
Well...

06:42.776 --> 06:47.011
Thank you for bringing him home.

06:48.279 --> 06:52.084
Your husband, Mr. Toole...

06:52.118 --> 06:54.552
I'll make sure he gets a nice raise.

07:23.917 --> 07:27.121
Then we have to get you back
to that hospital in Chicago.

07:27.155 --> 07:29.859
We are in trouble, Hannah.

07:29.893 --> 07:31.927
When the board comes, they'll see

07:31.961 --> 07:34.063
I've oversold the mileage.

07:34.097 --> 07:36.566
When are they coming?

07:36.600 --> 07:40.370
Soon. And if I'm not here
to explain our position,

07:40.405 --> 07:42.039
they'll replace me.

07:42.073 --> 07:44.508
It's not a matter of explanation.

07:44.543 --> 07:48.176
They are going to need convincing.

07:48.210 --> 07:50.944
Cullen Bohannon can do that...

07:50.979 --> 07:54.013
Especially if you make him a partner.

07:54.047 --> 07:56.448
He won't do it.

07:56.482 --> 08:00.449
He will... when you tell him
the fortune he'll make.

08:01.886 --> 08:03.989
Bohannon only thrives

08:04.023 --> 08:08.558
on narrow escapes from
his own recklessness.

08:08.592 --> 08:11.062
It's just like you, dear.

08:14.599 --> 08:16.067
Thank you.

08:16.101 --> 08:18.336

[Chuckles]

08:27.214 --> 08:29.416
I need to talk to you.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.986
I don't think there's
anything to talk about.

08:33.020 --> 08:37.192
I'm sorry for my behavior.

08:37.226 --> 08:38.493
You were drunk.

08:38.528 --> 08:41.796
I've decided I...

08:41.830 --> 08:46.902
Forgive you for your
relations with Joseph.

08:46.936 --> 08:50.039
You've decided to forgive me.

08:55.279 --> 08:57.481
Yes.

08:57.515 --> 09:00.183
Because you were right.

09:00.217 --> 09:03.919
I want you.

09:05.520 --> 09:08.990
Are you talking about marriage?

09:09.025 --> 09:11.226
Yes, of course.

09:13.963 --> 09:16.896
You're catholic, Sean.

09:24.236 --> 09:26.602
I'm a congregationalist minister.

09:28.704 --> 09:32.672
I can't marry a papist.

09:42.942 --> 09:45.641

09:47.477 --> 09:52.715
The other mornin', I woke up...

09:52.750 --> 09:55.052
There was someone
standin' at the door.

09:55.086 --> 09:59.055
Yeah.
Some old drunk.

09:59.089 --> 10:02.155
We'll put a cross bolt on there,

10:02.190 --> 10:05.123
you don't have to worry.

10:05.157 --> 10:06.723
It was a man...

10:06.758 --> 10:11.762
Red... like he'd been
dipped in blood.

10:11.796 --> 10:13.296
You was dreaming.

10:14.831 --> 10:17.665
He stood there looking in,

10:17.699 --> 10:19.966
like he was putting
a curse on this house.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.169
You stop that talk now.

10:24.438 --> 10:27.205
I got to kill somebody
for Mr. Durant.

10:29.008 --> 10:31.044
You done it before.

10:32.180 --> 10:35.481
It was always somebody
that needed killing.

10:35.516 --> 10:37.718
This is different.

10:39.056 --> 10:40.591
I worry about if I do it,

10:40.625 --> 10:41.924
I'll be putting a curse on this house

10:41.959 --> 10:43.759
and everybody that live in it.

10:43.794 --> 10:45.295
Don't do it then.

10:47.132 --> 10:51.235
Durant says it's the only way
he'll let me have this place.

10:55.208 --> 10:56.577
Here.

10:56.611 --> 10:59.078
You put the last one in.

11:02.884 --> 11:04.853
For luck.

11:22.473 --> 11:28.440
Mrs. Toole doesn't care
a stitch that I'm out here.

11:30.175 --> 11:33.477
She barely tolerates me touch.

11:35.876 --> 11:38.810
I'd give anything
to have her look at me

11:38.844 --> 11:41.045
the way that Mrs. Bell
looks at you.

11:45.017 --> 11:46.885
Well...

11:48.455 --> 11:51.060
You're a...

11:51.094 --> 11:54.494
You're a good worker.

11:54.528 --> 11:59.301
Woman ought to appreciate that.

12:00.538 --> 12:03.471
I thought once she saw me true self,

12:03.506 --> 12:06.407
she'd like me better.

12:07.644 --> 12:10.247
What a fool I am.

12:12.183 --> 12:14.417
Well...

12:16.054 --> 12:19.425
My worry is that, uh...

12:21.561 --> 12:25.264
Once Mrs. Bell gets
to know my true self...

12:26.767 --> 12:29.269
She ain't gonna like it.

12:31.372 --> 12:34.141
Funny part...

12:35.843 --> 12:41.751
The more I get to know
her... the more...

12:41.785 --> 12:44.386
You know.

12:51.961 --> 12:57.565
[Sighs] A lesser woman would've
run off a long time ago, I guess.

12:57.599 --> 13:01.203
What I've learned,
Mr. Bohannon...

13:01.238 --> 13:06.841
Is that anything that springs up
between you and your woman...

13:06.876 --> 13:09.774
You should rip it out by the root.

13:09.808 --> 13:12.512

13:17.553 --> 13:19.421
What?

13:20.792 --> 13:24.462
Just past that rise...

13:24.497 --> 13:28.634
There's Indian ponies with riders.

13:28.668 --> 13:29.836
What are they doing?

13:29.870 --> 13:31.771
Watching.

13:32.807 --> 13:36.041
They're always out here
lately at night.

13:37.309 --> 13:39.546
They could slip up and slit
our throats any minute.

13:39.580 --> 13:41.715
So why don't they then?

13:42.751 --> 13:45.921
I don't know.

13:45.955 --> 13:48.726
But I aim to find out.

13:55.868 --> 13:59.503
I should have known
what they was doin'.

There's always a reconnoitering
before a battle.

14:08.784 --> 14:12.791
Why didn't you send
someone out yourself?

14:14.928 --> 14:19.135
Anybody I would've sent out there
wouldn't have come back alive.

14:19.169 --> 14:22.104
I couldn't spare the men,

14:22.139 --> 14:24.139
the bridge was almost built.

14:24.173 --> 14:27.341
Do you think you were
being shortsighted?

14:30.913 --> 14:33.813
Them some nice shoes.

14:35.882 --> 14:37.883
Clean.

14:41.017 --> 14:42.685
Think you would've volunteered

14:42.719 --> 14:44.921
to go out and scout a thousand Sioux?

14:47.357 --> 14:49.557
[Chatter]

14:55.031 --> 14:57.130

15:02.905 --> 15:05.504
It's a milestone for all of us.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.306
Which makes it an ideal time

15:07.340 --> 15:09.075
to talk about your
plans for the future.

with women like you.

Ohh.

15:58.799 --> 16:02.234
You think
I'm cruel. Hmm?

16:02.268 --> 16:07.075
Tell me... what would
you do in my place?

16:09.176 --> 16:12.314
Thomas will write you
a check and a letter

16:12.348 --> 16:15.148
of introduction to a family
that's desperate for a governess.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.081
A governess?

16:17.116 --> 16:21.852
Please try and see this
in a positive light.

16:24.056 --> 16:26.390
It's a respectable family...

16:26.425 --> 16:29.729
With plenty of marriageable young men.

16:34.365 --> 16:38.066
I'm putting a very bright
future in your hands.

16:39.336 --> 16:40.803
Yes, you are.

16:40.837 --> 16:42.536
Thank you.

16:52.677 --> 16:55.155
Thank you for being the first one
to take her over, Mr. Bohannon.

16:55.380 --> 16:57.481
There were no other
volunteers, skipper.

16:57.515 --> 16:59.282
Well, most folks ain't interested

16:59.316 --> 17:01.150
in being crushed, boiled, or drowned.

19:58.896 --> 20:00.264
She's not here, Mr. Bohannon.

20:00.298 --> 20:03.234
Good job on the
bridge, Mr. Toole.

20:03.269 --> 20:04.369
All right.

Hey, y'all, listen up!

20:05.940 --> 20:08.542
Still got about a day's
work ahead of us.

20:08.576 --> 20:11.080
But there's a round
of drinks on Mr. Durant

20:11.114 --> 20:13.083
waiting for you
at the starlight tonight!

20:13.117 --> 20:14.383
Yeah!
All right!

20:14.418 --> 20:16.519
Come on, lads!
Back to work!

20:17.554 --> 20:19.623
You're welcome.

20:19.657 --> 20:21.459
Don't get cocky.

20:21.493 --> 20:23.926
We are still nowhere
near where we need to be.

20:23.960 --> 20:25.860
How far did you
tell the board we were?

20:25.895 --> 20:27.195
[Sighs]

20:27.229 --> 20:29.131
Leave the men to their work.

20:29.165 --> 20:31.299
Whoa. Easy, easy, easy.

20:33.538 --> 20:35.642
We need to talk.

21:31.041 --> 21:33.876
You all right,
Mrs. Bell?

21:36.247 --> 21:38.050
Mr. Ferguson.

21:38.085 --> 21:42.355
Yes. I'm just
closing the office.

21:44.426 --> 21:47.927
Mr. Durant is down
at the bridge site.

21:49.561 --> 21:52.196
Can I help you with something?

21:52.230 --> 21:53.799
No, ma'am.

21:53.834 --> 21:56.269
You have a good day.

21:56.303 --> 21:57.969
You, too.

22:32.516 --> 22:34.948
It'd be nice to have some real walls,

22:34.983 --> 22:37.785
keep out the cold, keep you warm.

22:39.153 --> 22:42.152
If your looking for my
husband, he's at work.

22:42.186 --> 22:44.119
I know where he at.

22:44.153 --> 22:46.958
Want to have that talk we was
going to have before you left.

22:46.992 --> 22:49.562
I've been back a while now,

22:49.596 --> 22:51.330
how come this is the first
time you showed up?

22:51.364 --> 22:53.834
I got a surprise for you.

22:53.868 --> 22:57.806
Surprises ain't been
good in my experience.

22:57.841 --> 22:59.275
This one is good.

22:59.310 --> 23:01.312
For you and the baby.

23:01.346 --> 23:05.652
You don't got to worry
about the baby no more.

23:06.821 --> 23:09.423
Why you say that?

23:09.458 --> 23:12.928
Because it's between me
and my husband now.

23:12.963 --> 23:16.030
He's got a future on this railroad.

23:16.065 --> 23:18.100
I heard you quit.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.905
I'm on my own now.

23:30.842 --> 23:33.576
I built us a house down by the river.

23:33.611 --> 23:37.082
Fresh water, land...

23:37.117 --> 23:39.520
Place where the baby can grow up.

23:41.489 --> 23:45.060
A good solid floor and freedom...

23:46.495 --> 23:48.995
A fireplace that ain't that smoky.

23:49.030 --> 23:50.264
Stop it.

23:50.298 --> 23:52.668
All our love can live there.

23:52.702 --> 23:54.035
Can you stop it?

23:54.069 --> 23:55.968
That ain't real.

23:56.003 --> 23:57.302
Yeah, it is.

23:57.336 --> 23:59.436
No, it ain't.

23:59.471 --> 24:02.536
And I got to pretend
that that don't exist.

24:03.771 --> 24:06.407
Come on. Come on.

24:06.442 --> 24:08.906
No, I got mending to do.

24:10.642 --> 24:13.481
Mr. Toole would be real angry
if he knew you were here.

24:13.516 --> 24:16.450
You should probably go.

24:39.712 --> 24:43.184
How would you like
to be a very rich man?

24:43.218 --> 24:46.085
Seen a lot of rich men
end up in shallow graves.

24:46.119 --> 24:49.921
When the board arrives, they will see
that I have misled the government

24:49.955 --> 24:52.323
on their behalf. [Sighs]

24:52.358 --> 24:53.992
They will move against me.

24:54.027 --> 24:57.998
They may even try
to have me imprisoned.

24:58.032 --> 25:03.105
The railroad will likely fail and,
well, you'll be out of a job.

25:03.139 --> 25:05.508
I've been in worse spots.

25:05.542 --> 25:10.514
I am offering you
a full partnership...

25:11.848 --> 25:14.648
If you will help me convince them

25:14.682 --> 25:17.150
that everything we have
done has been necessary.

25:25.695 --> 25:27.631
Now, why would they believe me?

25:27.665 --> 25:32.502
You are an interesting
anomaly, Mr. Bohannon.

25:32.537 --> 25:35.104
A gunslinger and an aristocrat.

25:35.138 --> 25:36.405
[Chuckles]

25:36.439 --> 25:38.839
Yeah, wouldn't go that
far in either direction.

25:38.874 --> 25:42.408
Look, I am unwell.

25:42.443 --> 25:44.846
I simply need you to back me up.

25:44.880 --> 25:47.680
What if they don't believe me?

25:47.714 --> 25:52.422
Well, there's a good chance that
you will share in the blame.

25:52.456 --> 25:54.425
And a jail cell.

25:54.460 --> 25:57.061
From the moment you accept my offer,

25:57.096 --> 26:00.666
all your debts owing to me
will be forgiven.

26:05.906 --> 26:09.443
All my debts to you were
buried with Doc Whitehead.

26:30.900 --> 26:32.167
Sign the check.

26:32.201 --> 26:35.104
[Sighs] I know her.

26:35.138 --> 26:38.341
She will not leave the railroad.

26:38.375 --> 26:41.780
This is the best way
for us to be rid of her.

26:41.814 --> 26:43.081
Is it?

26:43.115 --> 26:46.816
Have you done something
you haven't told me about?

26:48.719 --> 26:53.519
I will do this my way
if your way fails.

26:53.554 --> 26:55.555
Your way.

26:56.925 --> 27:01.028
As long as there's no mess.
Do you assure me?

27:03.030 --> 27:05.466
I'll sign the check...

27:05.500 --> 27:09.738
And then her fate will be
briefly in her hands...

27:11.340 --> 27:13.441
Before it's in mine.

27:22.788 --> 27:24.892
[Sighs]

27:33.373 --> 27:38.139
Mr. Durant has offered me a
permanent place with the railroad.

27:38.173 --> 27:41.474
[Chuckles] He, uh...

27:41.509 --> 27:43.575
He offered me a partnership.

27:43.609 --> 27:46.576
Then it must be your
job he's offering me.

27:46.611 --> 27:48.778
[Horses approaching]

27:51.112 --> 27:52.747
Whoa, whoa.

27:52.781 --> 27:56.620
It's one of our horses. Shit.

28:02.695 --> 28:06.498
It's too dangerous
for you to be out here now.

28:17.111 --> 28:19.779
I've been thinking
about what you said.

28:19.814 --> 28:24.183
About all you have
is your job... and me.

28:24.217 --> 28:27.320
All I have is this railroad and you.

28:27.354 --> 28:29.522
We can build it together.

28:29.556 --> 28:31.456
We already are.

28:31.490 --> 28:34.225
Everything...

28:34.260 --> 28:36.730
Everything to remove the
Durants is in this ledger.

28:36.765 --> 28:40.534
False mileage, skimming
profits, the whole lot.

28:40.568 --> 28:42.839
We can do this.

28:45.011 --> 28:46.379
Hey, no!

28:46.413 --> 28:47.813
Wait!

28:47.846 --> 28:49.346
Burning it before Durant finds
out and has you killed.

28:49.381 --> 28:51.482
I guaran-damn-tee he's
already thought about it.

28:52.517 --> 28:55.054
How do you know?

28:56.389 --> 28:57.887
Like he said,

28:57.922 --> 29:01.058
me and him's different
sides of the same coin.

29:01.093 --> 29:04.293
Mr. Bohannon!

29:06.161 --> 29:07.093
[Grunts]

29:07.128 --> 29:09.161
[Horses neighing]

29:09.195 --> 29:11.562
What is it?

29:11.596 --> 29:13.828
[Horses neighing]

29:13.863 --> 29:15.763
It's just an Indian.

29:15.797 --> 29:17.531
I don't know, sir...

29:17.565 --> 29:19.298
[Gunshot]

29:19.333 --> 29:21.066
[Horse neighs]

29:25.270 --> 29:26.737
Mr. Bohannon!

29:26.772 --> 29:28.238
Bring the lantern.

29:28.272 --> 29:29.705
Up there?

29:44.084 --> 29:46.184
Shine that light over here.

29:53.088 --> 29:54.654
Nicked him.

29:57.225 --> 29:59.826
Go on back to camp with Toole.

30:01.128 --> 30:04.928
Lily... burn that book.

30:48.326 --> 30:50.729
Would you keep this for me,

30:50.763 --> 30:54.765
and ship it back east...

30:54.799 --> 30:57.469
Ship it back east
if something happens?

30:58.639 --> 31:00.776
What kind of happen?

31:04.012 --> 31:07.750
In case I am killed,
Mr. Ferguson.

31:10.757 --> 31:12.690
Why not?

31:13.859 --> 31:15.928
If a white woman dies and
a black man in the stew,

31:15.962 --> 31:17.198
who gonna hang?

31:17.232 --> 31:19.498
I'm just asking you to keep it.

31:19.532 --> 31:21.233
And I'm just saying no.

31:21.267 --> 31:23.537
What have I done to offend you?

31:27.410 --> 31:31.146
Please? Please?

31:31.180 --> 31:34.886
Get on from here.
You on my property.

31:51.575 --> 31:54.009
This is for Eva.

31:57.481 --> 31:59.816
It's beautiful.

32:04.118 --> 32:06.381
Give me the damn package.

32:08.952 --> 32:11.119
Thank you, thank you.

32:16.694 --> 32:17.828
[Train whistle blowing]

32:37.008 --> 32:39.979
What's it mean when an
Indian paints hisself white?

32:42.752 --> 32:44.818
Where did you see the white spirit?

32:45.953 --> 32:49.856
Down at the gorge.
What's it mean?

32:55.961 --> 32:58.763
The Sioux nation
wants everyone here to die.

32:58.797 --> 33:00.698
When?

33:00.732 --> 33:04.170
Soon.

33:05.204 --> 33:07.972
It'll be a blood bath.

33:10.042 --> 33:14.780
I don't care what happens
to anyone here... but Ruth.

33:14.814 --> 33:16.915
No offense taken.

33:18.817 --> 33:21.153
You've changed,
Mr. Bohannon.

33:21.188 --> 33:25.192
Yeah? I'd say it's you.
Take me out there.

33:28.497 --> 33:32.033
If they catch us...
They'll kill you.

33:33.436 --> 33:36.203
Take me out there right now.

33:58.161 --> 33:59.862
You wanted to see me?

34:06.407 --> 34:08.674
It's your take from the saloon.

34:09.943 --> 34:11.742
You were holding out on me.

34:11.777 --> 34:13.043
That's for your own good.

34:13.077 --> 34:15.809
Against the church...
Woman.

34:16.844 --> 34:19.681
Word is you've separated
from her, yeah?

34:19.716 --> 34:22.384
Actually, we're closer than ever.

34:22.418 --> 34:24.284
She'll never convert to the faith.

34:24.319 --> 34:26.585
I'm going to convert to hers.

34:27.687 --> 34:30.221
Would you listen to yourself?

34:30.255 --> 34:32.322
She's infected your mind.

34:32.356 --> 34:33.989
I thought it through.

34:34.024 --> 34:35.559
That'd kill mum.

34:35.592 --> 34:37.929
You'll burn in hell, Sean.

34:37.964 --> 34:41.328
You're forever cast
in the lake of fire.

34:41.362 --> 34:42.795
Children's catechism.

34:42.830 --> 34:44.764
It's in the Bible.

34:44.800 --> 34:47.199
I came to America to build

34:47.234 --> 34:50.801
a life in this world, not the next.

34:50.835 --> 34:55.141
Then I'll have to disown you.

34:59.577 --> 35:01.780
Whew.

35:03.485 --> 35:05.921
Do you know who I am?

35:07.754 --> 35:09.788
Your Elam's friend.

35:09.822 --> 35:11.325
I'm his brother.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.627
I'd be that baby's Uncle.

35:15.028 --> 35:17.760
I appreciate your thoughts,

35:17.795 --> 35:20.727
but I'm Mrs. Toole
and this is his baby.

35:20.762 --> 35:22.530
If that how you see it,

35:22.565 --> 35:24.401
then you need to talk to Elam,

35:24.435 --> 35:26.840
'cause his heart is tearing all apart.

35:47.797 --> 35:50.697
It isn't time for
the gathering of tribes.

35:50.732 --> 35:52.435
A blood moon is coming.

35:52.470 --> 35:54.336
What's a blood moon?

35:54.371 --> 35:57.639
It's a time for bloodletting...

35:57.673 --> 35:59.374
The settling of scores.

35:59.408 --> 36:01.677
Between who?
The tribes?

36:01.711 --> 36:04.380
They will come against you.

36:10.322 --> 36:12.422
[Yelling in background]

36:21.728 --> 36:24.328
I want you to come and tell Durant,

36:24.363 --> 36:27.130
so he don't think I'm crazy.

36:28.531 --> 36:31.869
You'll never see me again.

36:37.376 --> 36:41.810
What did you do after you
discovered the Sioux threat?

36:44.579 --> 36:48.083
Telegraphed the fort
and asked for soldiers.

36:48.117 --> 36:50.416
We sent men and weapons.

36:50.450 --> 36:55.185
Yeah, five recruits and a small cannon.
Much obliged.

37:02.661 --> 37:07.367
Baptism is a sacramental
cleansing of a life.

37:07.402 --> 37:09.536
Do you understand that?

37:09.570 --> 37:12.405
Of course.

37:19.714 --> 37:24.785
You affirm your love
of God above all things.

37:24.819 --> 37:27.516
All people.

37:29.117 --> 37:30.950
God should be so lucky.

37:30.984 --> 37:35.150
This is serious, Sean.

37:35.184 --> 37:38.684
You're going to have to
renounce your faith.

37:39.951 --> 37:45.220
You're going to have
to give up your saloon,

37:45.255 --> 37:47.658
the pleasure house...
And?

37:47.692 --> 37:49.292
And...

37:50.326 --> 37:54.864
I just can't believe
you're going to do that.

37:54.898 --> 37:58.803
Doesn't your church compel you

37:58.837 --> 38:01.103
to baptize anyone who asks?

38:02.370 --> 38:06.607
If you are sincere, Sean.

38:06.641 --> 38:10.573
Does your God allow you
to deny me access to him?

38:12.978 --> 38:15.213
Of course not.

38:15.247 --> 38:16.647
Well...

38:24.761 --> 38:27.460
To the river then.

39:08.481 --> 39:10.449
Is it that ugly?

39:11.784 --> 39:15.386
No... it's beautiful.

39:15.421 --> 39:18.526
I knew you'd come
around once you saw it...

39:18.560 --> 39:21.461
And saw that I was serious.

39:22.696 --> 39:24.795
I'm married, Elam.

39:24.829 --> 39:27.330
Don't matter out here.

39:31.500 --> 39:36.007
No...
My husband is, um...

39:36.041 --> 39:40.177
He's... he's a good
provider, and, uh...

39:40.211 --> 39:43.382
He's gonna be a good father.

39:44.551 --> 39:46.820
Me, too.

39:46.855 --> 39:48.221
No.

39:48.255 --> 39:50.288
Think about it.

39:52.123 --> 39:54.528
No, um...

39:57.332 --> 40:02.136
I'll always love you, Elam, but I...

40:02.171 --> 40:05.207
My future is
with Mr. Toole.

40:07.177 --> 40:09.246
You know you don't want that.

40:09.280 --> 40:11.983
It doesn't matter what I want.

40:12.017 --> 40:14.253
It's what's best.

40:17.156 --> 40:18.522
Good-bye.

40:18.557 --> 40:19.890
Eva!

40:21.559 --> 40:23.262
Oh, no.

40:28.635 --> 40:31.272
I looked all over for ya,

40:31.306 --> 40:33.408
prayed to God and Christ
you weren't here,

40:33.442 --> 40:36.509
but here you are.

40:37.410 --> 40:40.345
It's not... it's not
what you think.

40:40.380 --> 40:42.314
Steady, Mr. Ferguson!

40:45.885 --> 40:48.689
I thought we were on our way.

40:49.692 --> 40:50.893
We are.

40:50.928 --> 40:52.464
God spared me once,

40:52.498 --> 40:56.935
for what...
I thought it was you.

40:56.969 --> 40:59.603
Now I see God is a malicious bastard,

40:59.637 --> 41:02.371
a streak of cruelty
as wide as the sky.

41:02.406 --> 41:06.107
No. I came to tell him that it's
over between us, I swear it.

41:06.141 --> 41:07.408
I love you, Eva, and you made me think

41:07.442 --> 41:10.778
that you loved me
just a little bit, as well.

41:10.813 --> 41:12.412
I do.

41:12.447 --> 41:15.015
Your heart is for
this black son of a bitch!

41:15.050 --> 41:17.786
Don't, please.

41:19.922 --> 41:22.357
Please.

41:25.363 --> 41:27.665
Forgive me, father.

41:33.810 --> 41:36.512
Aah!

41:48.297 --> 41:50.266
Elam!

42:24.319 --> 42:25.653
I'm so sorry.

42:25.687 --> 42:27.761
Thank you.

42:31.527 --> 42:34.061
[Coins dropping]

42:34.095 --> 42:38.368
Do you renounce the spiritual
forces of wickedness,

42:38.402 --> 42:41.704
reject the evil powers of this world,

42:41.738 --> 42:44.305
and repent of your sin?

42:44.340 --> 42:47.410
I do.

42:47.444 --> 42:50.182
Do you accept the freedom and power

42:50.216 --> 42:53.551
God gives you to resist evil

42:53.585 --> 42:57.492
and oppression in whatever
forms they present themselves?

42:57.527 --> 42:59.897
I do.

43:00.999 --> 43:04.568
Do you confess Jesus
Christ as your savior

43:04.603 --> 43:09.441
and promise to serve him as your lord?

43:09.475 --> 43:11.711
I do.

43:11.745 --> 43:13.681
Wherever
Mr. Gregory Toole is...

43:13.715 --> 43:17.716
I'm sure he wishes he hadn't...

43:17.750 --> 43:20.250
He hadn't done what he did.

43:21.886 --> 43:26.686
It's the nature
of this place, isn't it?

43:28.056 --> 43:33.795
Goes and makes ya do things
that can't be undone.

43:35.361 --> 43:38.766
He gave every man a square deal,

43:38.800 --> 43:42.769
he always bought us
a fair share of rounds.

43:42.804 --> 43:46.604
He liked to drink...

43:49.040 --> 43:51.976
He loved his wife.

43:52.979 --> 43:57.485
Today...
Today, we bury a brother.

43:59.753 --> 44:05.558
Sliocht sleachta ar
shliocht bhur sleachta...

44:05.592 --> 44:10.426
May there be a generation of children

44:10.461 --> 44:14.528
on the children of your children.

44:17.533 --> 44:18.967
Amen.

44:25.638 --> 44:31.072
Jesus, accept this humble
servant into your heart.

44:31.107 --> 44:35.745
Be reborn in the glory of Christ.

44:54.166 --> 44:59.536
Brother Sean... your sins
are washed away.

44:59.570 --> 45:01.737
I thought the lord was going to
send the angel Gabriel himself

45:01.772 --> 45:02.938
to strike me blind.

45:02.972 --> 45:07.076
Well, thankfully, that didn't happen.

45:20.487 --> 45:21.855
Ohh.

45:23.724 --> 45:25.691
Sean.

45:28.394 --> 45:30.664
Sean, stop!

45:45.145 --> 45:47.846
Good day, Mr. Durant.

45:47.881 --> 45:51.488
I thought we had
an agreement, Mr. Ferguson.

45:53.057 --> 45:54.856
This job you need doing...

45:54.890 --> 45:57.056
Cold feet, hmm?

45:57.091 --> 45:59.191
I would've thought...

45:59.226 --> 46:05.663
That you would want to keep your
land, your house, your future...

46:05.697 --> 46:08.230
You said after the bridge...

46:08.265 --> 46:11.133
The bridge is complete.

46:11.168 --> 46:13.735
It's time, Mr. Ferguson.

46:20.704 --> 46:23.402
Good boy. Good boy.

46:27.807 --> 46:30.242
[Train whistle blowing]

46:32.446 --> 46:34.711
"From major Joshua
Short, U.S. Army...

"Dear Thomas...

"I received your request
for military support.

"Though I wish I could accommodate
all similar requests,

unless your scout can provide
better intelligence..."

46:49.817 --> 46:54.387
"I'm afraid we can't
accommodate you at this time."

46:55.321 --> 46:57.988
This is some kind of bullshit.

46:58.022 --> 47:00.158
This is the world we live in.

47:00.193 --> 47:03.398
We cannot panic every time
somebody sees an Indian

47:03.432 --> 47:05.301
and bring the work to a halt.

47:05.335 --> 47:06.669
Well, guess what? The
men are already spooked.

47:06.703 --> 47:09.538
Damn it!
Thomas...

47:11.339 --> 47:13.340
What will you need?

47:13.375 --> 47:15.711
To keep them working?

[Footsteps]

47:26.658 --> 47:28.292
Cullen?

47:33.566 --> 47:35.902
Mr. Ferguson.

47:39.138 --> 47:42.340
Sit down.

47:47.981 --> 47:51.449
Did you change your mind
about sending it?

47:51.483 --> 47:54.715
In case something happen to you?

47:54.750 --> 47:56.317
Mr. Durant have it his way,

47:56.351 --> 47:59.187
I'm gonna be shipping
it in the morning.

48:05.596 --> 48:08.598
You're here to kill me.

48:10.167 --> 48:13.439
Mr. Durant
promised me my land

48:13.473 --> 48:15.573
and my house down on the river.

48:23.083 --> 48:27.189
My life is worth only a few
acres of river bottom.

48:27.224 --> 48:29.424
It's a nice spot.

48:32.094 --> 48:34.395
How are you going to do it?

48:34.429 --> 48:36.896
Strangle or cut.

48:39.230 --> 48:41.562
Probably cut.

48:57.346 --> 49:00.079
You got a reason for me not to?

49:01.181 --> 49:02.615
I don't think you're the person

49:02.650 --> 49:04.351
the Durants think you are.

49:04.386 --> 49:07.220
I done my share of killing.

49:08.489 --> 49:11.190
Not like this.

49:27.437 --> 49:30.472
How would you like
to be chief of security

49:30.507 --> 49:32.342
operations on this railroad?

49:32.376 --> 49:34.678
Cullen Bohannon already that.

49:34.712 --> 49:36.315
Upon the arrest of the Durants,

49:36.349 --> 49:39.820
Mr. Bohannon and I will be
his natural replacements.

49:39.854 --> 49:41.989
How the Durants arrested?

49:42.024 --> 49:46.631
Once that package
reaches its destination,

49:46.666 --> 49:50.067
there'll be a warrant
issued for Mr. Durant.

49:50.101 --> 49:56.573
For you, a permanent position
of respect on this railroad.

50:00.213 --> 50:03.313
Do we have a deal?

50:33.536 --> 50:35.198
What is it?

50:35.364 --> 50:36.537
Is it Indian?

50:36.572 --> 50:38.239
No, ma'am...

50:40.509 --> 50:42.677
Mr. Gunderson?

50:43.445 --> 50:45.113
[Crying]

51:13.509 --> 51:16.980
Mr. Ferguson
came to see me last night.

51:17.983 --> 51:20.116
Ah.

51:21.252 --> 51:26.024
Well, you had your chance, Lily.

51:26.058 --> 51:29.230
We asked you to leave town nicely.

51:32.734 --> 51:35.403
I told you already, Thomas.

51:35.438 --> 51:37.241
I won't be pushed out.

51:37.275 --> 51:39.144
[Chuckles]

51:39.179 --> 51:43.816
You betrayed me to Bohannon
over pillow talk.

51:43.851 --> 51:48.220
So you decided to have me killed.

51:48.254 --> 51:50.256
It's vulgar, Thomas.

51:50.290 --> 51:51.591
Sordid.

The railroad is at stake!

51:52.861 --> 51:55.095
The railroad.
The railroad?

51:55.129 --> 51:58.468
I have borne every privation
for this railroad!

51:58.502 --> 52:01.206
I lost my husband, killed
another human being,

52:01.240 --> 52:04.675
suffered humiliation at
the hands of your wife...

52:04.710 --> 52:06.745
I've even endured your bed!

52:06.779 --> 52:11.117
That, Lily, makes you a whore.

52:12.553 --> 52:16.156
[Sighs] Know then that
when your precious railroad

52:16.191 --> 52:18.525
is ripped from your thick
and grasping fingers

52:18.559 --> 52:20.327
that you've been undone by a whore.

52:20.361 --> 52:22.196
Why?

52:24.099 --> 52:25.767
What have you done?

52:27.003 --> 52:31.170
I'll leave you to your work.

52:37.778 --> 52:41.948
I was their white spirit...

They stretched me on the ground

52:45.491 --> 52:50.559
and they built
small fires upon my body.

I should never have turned
to the... the heathens.

53:04.406 --> 53:08.080
You should never have lost
your place in this town.

I have...
I have missed you...

that going to be?

53:44.353 --> 53:46.486
Tomorrow night.

53:46.521 --> 53:49.055
Oh, God!

53:58.230 --> 54:01.167
There's no need for
that, Mr. Bohannon.

54:01.201 --> 54:02.769
Look at him.

54:02.803 --> 54:04.269
I doubt he's even going to
make it through the night.

54:04.303 --> 54:06.737
Friend of yours or not,

54:06.771 --> 54:08.839
he's going to hang for
sabotaging the railroad.

54:08.874 --> 54:10.408
I'm putting a guard on him.

54:11.544 --> 54:13.747
Hey, you!

[Groaning]

54:15.583 --> 54:17.650

Stop! This is not the way.

54:32.198 --> 54:33.432

54:33.467 --> 54:34.666
Stop!

54:34.701 --> 54:36.333
Stop!

54:36.368 --> 54:38.336
You will not kill
another man in a rage,

54:38.370 --> 54:40.205
I won't have Durant's
blood on my hands.

54:40.239 --> 54:41.538
Then why the hell did you tell me?

54:41.573 --> 54:44.872
To prove to you finally
that he has to go.

54:44.907 --> 54:48.213
But not this way.

54:48.247 --> 54:51.347
You and I can build
this railroad together.

54:51.382 --> 54:54.185
I've already shipped the ledger.

54:54.219 --> 54:56.921
But the board won't
take a woman seriously.

54:56.955 --> 54:59.290
I can't do this without you.

55:03.727 --> 55:07.129
And you...

55:08.431 --> 55:13.901
You're better with me, aren't you?

55:16.334 --> 55:17.701
Yeah.

55:18.903 --> 55:21.205
I am.

55:23.711 --> 55:27.946
I want you on the first
railcar out of here.

55:27.980 --> 55:30.080
You ain't gonna be on it, is you?

55:30.114 --> 55:31.450
No.

55:31.484 --> 55:33.616
Thought so.

55:35.584 --> 55:37.382
Protect our bridge.

55:37.417 --> 55:41.589
I'll be here waiting for
you when you get back.

56:05.949 --> 56:07.681
You know how to work a cannon?

56:07.715 --> 56:09.785
Cannon?

56:09.819 --> 56:12.221

You really got one?

You welcome.

Gotta ask you though.

56:31.911 --> 56:34.447
Was you ever gonna do it?

56:34.481 --> 56:36.749
You know your Bible?

56:36.784 --> 56:39.684
Some.

56:39.718 --> 56:41.817
You know when the angel came down,

56:41.851 --> 56:45.920
grab a hold of Abraham's arm right
before he cut Isaac's neck?

56:45.954 --> 56:47.288
Yeah?

56:47.322 --> 56:49.157
It won't like that.

56:49.192 --> 56:52.894
Almost got my ass shot.

56:54.229 --> 56:57.363
She ain't a woman to be messed with.

56:57.398 --> 56:59.065
True.

56:59.099 --> 57:00.532
True, she ain't.

57:54.350 --> 57:59.623
My personal ledgers...
How damning are they?

57:59.657 --> 58:05.966
You ask because
you have lost them, hmm?

58:06.000 --> 58:08.569
How damning?

58:08.603 --> 58:14.111
How far you are falling, min herrdome.

58:14.146 --> 58:21.750
You may fall through
the floor into hell itself.

58:21.784 --> 58:23.818

58:30.663 --> 58:34.366
What am I going to do?

58:34.400 --> 58:40.832
You are suffering...
That is good!

58:40.867 --> 58:45.238
Suffering builds character.

58:45.273 --> 58:50.609
You will need that during
your incarceration.

58:50.643 --> 58:51.978
I will die in prison.

58:52.013 --> 58:57.449
[Gasping] That is not true.

58:57.484 --> 59:01.222
Come... come.

59:01.256 --> 59:03.824
The truth is...

59:03.858 --> 59:08.461
You will not die in prison but here.

Soon, in the streets
of hell on wheels...

kiss you farewell.

59:36.299 --> 59:39.970
Was Durant aware of
the impending attack?

59:40.004 --> 59:45.611

Ah. A beautiful
bridge, Mr. Bohannon.

01:20:20.650 --> 01:20:27.287
An enduring monument to
the vision of Mrs. Lily Bell...

01:20:30.805 --> 01:20:33.994
And your own myopic
single-mindedness.

01:20:34.342 --> 01:20:35.707
[chuckles]

01:20:35.827 --> 01:20:39.020
I was surprised that
you made it

01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:41.192
so easy

01:20:41.769 --> 01:20:44.052
to take her from you.

01:20:46.924 --> 01:20:48.203
Thank you.

01:20:48.947 --> 01:20:50.386
It was, uh...

01:20:51.267 --> 01:20:53.563
inexplicably pleasurable...

01:20:59.819 --> 01:21:02.425
Not as much as it'll
be to see you swing.

01:21:04.188 --> 01:21:05.503
You evil son of a bitch.

01:21:05.838 --> 01:21:08.593
Regrettably not, Mr. Bohannon...

01:21:08.713 --> 01:21:09.869
[chuckles]

01:21:10.874 --> 01:21:13.902
...for you and I are now...

01:21:16.011 --> 01:21:17.761
consumated.

01:21:19.425 --> 01:21:20.841
Are we not?

01:21:26.721 --> 01:21:28.098
Adieu to you!

01:21:28.218 --> 01:21:29.649
Good day!

01:21:32.074 --> 01:21:33.274
Whoa!

01:22:08.724 --> 01:22:10.962
Mr. Bohannon...

01:22:12.362 --> 01:22:15.627
It's gonna take some time
to sort this all out.

01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:19.921
Meanwhile, the President
of the United States

01:22:19.946 --> 01:22:23.046
has ordered the construction
of the railroad to continue.

01:22:24.969 --> 01:22:30.249
Would you entertain in assuming
Mr. Durant's role and leading us westward?

01:22:36.803 --> 01:22:38.218
Mr. Bohannon...

01:22:39.421 --> 01:22:41.821
will you finish this road?
