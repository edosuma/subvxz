What I tell you in here...

42:16.937 --> 42:19.738
By law, what are you required to report?

42:22.276 --> 42:25.610
Well, if I believe you're a
danger to yourself or others,

42:25.612 --> 42:29.514
if you plan on committing
a crime in the future,

42:29.516 --> 42:31.516
or if there are children involved.

42:31.518 --> 42:33.051
Those I report.

42:33.053 --> 42:35.587
Anything else is between us.
