WEBVTT

00:08.433 --> 00:09.667
Mm!

00:09.733 --> 00:11.667
Mm!

00:11.733 --> 00:13.433
I'm not staying.

00:13.500 --> 00:15.267
Do you have any more
cream cheese for this bagel?

00:15.333 --> 00:16.867
Todd, just sit down.

00:16.933 --> 00:18.300
Oh, thank you.

00:18.367 --> 00:20.533
You know what the Japanese say,

00:20.600 --> 00:23.467
"It's better to eat a stone
sitting down

00:23.533 --> 00:25.600
than a glazed cronut
standing up."

00:25.667 --> 00:27.000
Then why were you
doing it?

00:28.033 --> 00:28.967
I'm not Japanese.

00:29.033 --> 00:30.600
I am, however,

00:30.667 --> 00:33.467
part Comanche,
on my stepfather's side.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.267
I wonder if I could get
a casino license

00:35.333 --> 00:36.433
for the mancave?

00:36.500 --> 00:37.700
Not a chance.

00:37.767 --> 00:39.300
It'd never get past
the health inspector.

00:39.367 --> 00:40.833
Gigi, literally,

00:40.900 --> 00:42.733
what are you doing?

00:42.800 --> 00:44.700
This is brunch,
not tech lab.

00:44.767 --> 00:46.500
You know what,

00:46.567 --> 00:47.800
this is not
going to work.

00:47.867 --> 00:48.833
I'll just go ex tempora.

00:48.900 --> 00:49.867
There she goes,

00:49.933 --> 00:51.433
showing off her French again.

00:51.500 --> 00:52.600
Latin, Dad.

00:52.667 --> 00:54.533
It means "off the cuff."

00:55.667 --> 00:58.033
Family unit, huge announcement!

00:58.100 --> 00:59.600
I had a PowerPoint
prepared,

00:59.667 --> 01:02.067
but this projector
lacks the lumens

01:02.133 --> 01:03.667
for adequate
daylight refraction.

01:03.733 --> 01:05.600
What is it?

01:05.667 --> 01:06.933
Go on,
tell us.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.900
I, Gigi Cooper,

01:08.967 --> 01:10.933
have been accepted
into the Edison Academy.

01:11.067 --> 01:12.067
Mic drop!

01:17.667 --> 01:20.367
Um... it's one of the most
prestigious magnet programs

01:20.433 --> 01:21.467
in the country?

01:21.533 --> 01:22.667
Uh, kinda weird

01:22.733 --> 01:24.900
to go to a school
just to study magnets,

01:24.967 --> 01:26.300
but congrats.

01:26.367 --> 01:28.767
Well, that's incredible, Gigi.

01:28.833 --> 01:30.067
I mean, but do you really want
to switch schools?

01:30.100 --> 01:32.500
No, Dad,
it's an after-school program.

01:32.567 --> 01:34.067
I didn't want
to bother you

01:34.100 --> 01:34.967
with the paperwork,

01:35.067 --> 01:36.500
so I just applied myself.

01:36.567 --> 01:37.500
Like I always do.

01:37.567 --> 01:38.867
Really impressive, Gigi.

01:38.933 --> 01:42.200
How does such a giant brain live
in such a tiny body?

01:42.267 --> 01:44.333
Yeah, with you,
it's the other way around.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.433
Just because I'm not Japanese

01:46.500 --> 01:48.067
doesn't mean
I don't have feelings.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.900
What in the world is that?

01:50.967 --> 01:52.133
Oh, this?

01:52.200 --> 01:54.633
It's a, uh, it's a bagel
with cream cheese.

01:54.700 --> 01:56.067
Cream cheese?

01:57.300 --> 01:59.500
Where are the empanadas
and chilaquiles?

01:59.567 --> 02:02.067
Rosa, Gigi has big news.

02:02.100 --> 02:03.067
Amazing.

02:03.133 --> 02:04.400
Wait till you hear!

02:04.467 --> 02:05.900
I have never seen
a whiter brunch.

02:05.967 --> 02:08.967
Do you need more milk to go
with that egg-white omelet?

02:09.067 --> 02:10.667
I do!
Did you bring some?

02:11.700 --> 02:13.500
Forget I asked.

02:13.567 --> 02:14.767
Rosa, calm down.

02:14.833 --> 02:17.500
Have a seat, and let Gigi
tell you her news.

02:17.567 --> 02:18.700
Oh, no,
I couldn't possibly.

02:18.767 --> 02:20.333
I-- There's no way
that I can eat this food.

02:20.400 --> 02:21.633
It's far too bland.

02:21.700 --> 02:23.433
Darling, Gigi,

02:23.500 --> 02:26.133
you can tell me your news
later, right?

02:26.200 --> 02:27.933
Adios.

02:29.700 --> 02:32.567
The food's really
too white for her?

02:32.633 --> 02:34.500
No.

02:34.567 --> 02:36.067
We are.

02:58.067 --> 03:00.067
Okay, um...

03:00.133 --> 03:01.633
Left. My left.
Your right

03:01.700 --> 03:03.067
My right.

03:03.067 --> 03:04.467
Ready?

03:07.067 --> 03:08.067
Ow-- Dad!

03:08.133 --> 03:09.600
I'm sorry,
Mirabel.

03:09.667 --> 03:10.733
You know, being a pitcher,

03:10.800 --> 03:12.933
footwork was never
my strong suit.

03:13.067 --> 03:15.100
You know, I once
stole a base,

03:15.167 --> 03:17.467
and I was so slow,
they asked for it back.

03:17.533 --> 03:18.700
Ba-dum-bum.

03:18.767 --> 03:20.233
Thank you, Elisa.

03:20.300 --> 03:24.100
I'm glad someone appreciates
my, uh, razor-sharp wit.

03:24.167 --> 03:26.500
See, Mirabel,
if you were doing a comedy show,

03:26.567 --> 03:27.833
I could help you with that.

03:27.900 --> 03:30.500
If I was doing ballet,
I'd be absolutely fine,

03:30.567 --> 03:31.867
but I've never had to do

03:31.933 --> 03:33.633
any of this
"Dancing With the Stars" stuff.

03:33.700 --> 03:34.933
No, you'll be fine.

03:35.067 --> 03:37.067
You're a natural,
you always have been.

03:37.100 --> 03:38.167
Why don't you just tell Liam

03:38.233 --> 03:39.467
you can't do
his dumb dance class?

03:39.533 --> 03:40.767
Say you've got homework.

03:42.100 --> 03:43.400
You're right.

03:43.467 --> 03:44.933
He'd never believe that.

03:51.067 --> 03:52.600
Ah!

03:52.667 --> 03:54.067
You should be dancing, Ricky.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.067
Pardon me.
To the left, please.

04:13.167 --> 04:15.200
Okay, now you're just
making it weird.

04:15.267 --> 04:16.900
We're...
making it weird?

04:16.967 --> 04:18.833
What exactly are you
doing here, Alan?

04:18.900 --> 04:20.400
You said something
to Stephanie

04:20.467 --> 04:24.967
about Mirabel needing practice
for her boyfriend's dance class?

04:25.067 --> 04:26.567
And you were eavesdropping.

04:28.100 --> 04:30.533
No, I was just being
a good employee.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.467
Might as well
let him do his thing, Dad.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.200
It can't go any worse.

04:34.267 --> 04:36.833
Whew, and with that
rousing endorsement...

04:37.767 --> 04:38.900
May I?

04:38.967 --> 04:39.967
I...

04:40.067 --> 04:41.633
I guess?

04:41.700 --> 04:42.767
Yes!

04:42.833 --> 04:43.733
Boom!

04:43.800 --> 04:44.800
Check this out.

04:57.967 --> 04:59.700
Okay. All right.

05:02.067 --> 05:03.667
A little bit of this.

05:03.733 --> 05:05.700
A little bit
of this...

05:05.767 --> 05:08.067
Oh, I'm sorry,
I've got a rope in my hand,

05:08.100 --> 05:10.133
gonna lasso you down.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.333
Gonna bring you in.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.233
Ooh, a little bit
of T-bone steak.

05:13.300 --> 05:14.300
Maybe a Rib eye.

05:16.867 --> 05:17.867
Shoulders, shoulders.

05:17.933 --> 05:20.800
Bump and bump. Eyes.

05:23.300 --> 05:25.400
Yes!

05:27.367 --> 05:28.667
Get outta my face...

05:33.600 --> 05:35.167
Oh... Ha!

05:35.233 --> 05:36.900
And now I'm a tiger!

05:39.167 --> 05:40.800
Hey there.

05:40.867 --> 05:42.133
Hey! Hi!
Hey, Rosa.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.700
I was just
wanting to tell you

05:43.767 --> 05:45.067
that I think

05:45.100 --> 05:46.700
if anyone is going
to teach Mirabel to dance,

05:46.767 --> 05:47.900
it should be me.

05:47.967 --> 05:50.300
No, no, no, it...
it's okay, Abuela.

05:50.367 --> 05:52.533
I'm fine
with Alan and...

05:52.600 --> 05:53.667
and Dad.

05:53.733 --> 05:55.867
Oh, well, I mean,
who wouldn't be?

05:55.933 --> 05:57.700
But let me just try
something for a minute?

05:57.767 --> 05:59.700
Sure-- Yes!
It's gonna be great.

05:59.767 --> 06:00.833
Five, six,
seven, eight,

06:00.900 --> 06:03.700
and one, two,
cha-cha-cha...

06:05.467 --> 06:06.600
One, two
cha-cha-cha--

06:08.067 --> 06:09.367
No--

06:09.433 --> 06:11.867
This is salsa dancing,
not kickboxing, darling.

06:11.933 --> 06:13.167
Good one, Abuela.

06:13.233 --> 06:14.667
Okay, here,
let me help you.

06:14.733 --> 06:17.067
And... five, six,
seven, eight.

06:20.067 --> 06:21.600
Cha-cha-cha.

06:21.667 --> 06:22.833
Nicely done.

06:22.900 --> 06:24.233
You got those moves,
Miss Rosa.

06:24.300 --> 06:25.700
Like that one.

06:28.933 --> 06:29.900
Cha-cha-cha...

06:29.967 --> 06:33.367
Uh, Abuela,
can we take a five?

06:33.433 --> 06:35.433
Oh, you're
giving up so soon?

06:35.500 --> 06:37.267
Clearly, you don't
have my stamina.

06:37.333 --> 06:39.067
Not many people do.

06:39.133 --> 06:40.833
I'm gonna go get Gigi
at Little Einsteins.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.100
I think you've
got this covered.

06:42.167 --> 06:45.067
-No, no, no, no, no, no.
-You're doing great.

06:46.433 --> 06:48.200
Darling, you just
have to work at it.

06:48.267 --> 06:50.833
One, two,
cha-cha-cha.

06:50.900 --> 06:52.700
One, two.
Cha-cha-cha.

06:52.767 --> 06:54.200
So?

06:54.267 --> 06:56.600
How was your first day
with the Little Einsteins?

06:56.667 --> 06:59.200
Dad, they're not
"Little Einsteins."

06:59.267 --> 07:01.467
That was a series
of educational videos

07:01.533 --> 07:03.167
we watched
when we were five.

07:03.233 --> 07:04.933
Well, two in my case.

07:05.067 --> 07:07.200
I stand corrected.

07:07.267 --> 07:08.733
But to answer
your question,

07:08.800 --> 07:11.133
it was a-ma-zing.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.233
There was this boy

07:12.300 --> 07:14.300
who memorized pi
to 3,000 digits!

07:14.367 --> 07:16.067
And another girl
who can do a Rubik's cube

07:16.100 --> 07:17.100
behind her back,

07:17.167 --> 07:19.067
in ten seconds!

07:19.100 --> 07:20.800
You're finally
with your people.

07:20.867 --> 07:22.500
I know.
It's like Nerd-vana.

07:22.567 --> 07:23.967
I can't wait
to tell my friends.

07:24.067 --> 07:27.333
Yeah, maybe don't use
the word "Nerd-vana."

07:29.067 --> 07:30.367
But, Abuela,

07:30.433 --> 07:32.833
what do you mean
we need to me more Latina?

07:32.900 --> 07:34.100
I mean, hija,

07:34.167 --> 07:37.867
that gringo brunch
on Saturday scared me.

07:37.933 --> 07:39.600
I mean,
with me not living here,

07:39.667 --> 07:41.300
and your mother gone,

07:41.367 --> 07:43.733
everyone is forgetting
their roots.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.433
Okay, but you have to realize

07:45.500 --> 07:47.800
this stuff comes
more naturally to us.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.333
Dad's kinda
as gringo as they get.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.733
You've got that right.

07:50.800 --> 07:51.900
Leave him to me.

07:53.433 --> 07:54.900
Time to pump up
the Latino!

07:58.167 --> 07:59.867
I can't believe
you get to leave early

08:00.067 --> 08:01.333
to go to that
Dork Academy.

08:01.400 --> 08:04.267
Yeah,
you're so lucky.

08:04.333 --> 08:06.133
You guys,
they're not dorks,

08:06.200 --> 08:09.067
they're just smart kids
who enjoy...

08:09.067 --> 08:11.400
advanced coding
and French literature.

08:11.467 --> 08:13.300
They're really nice.

08:13.367 --> 08:14.867
But they're
smarter than us.

08:14.933 --> 08:17.067
That's not what I'm saying.

08:17.133 --> 08:18.800
I'm only missing Garden,

08:18.867 --> 08:20.100
and Miss Jessica said

08:20.167 --> 08:21.933
I can do her botanical
experiments at home.

08:22.067 --> 08:23.267
Oh, is the soil
in your backyard

08:23.333 --> 08:24.867
as brown
as your nose?

08:26.233 --> 08:29.967
I have a text
on celestial movement on hold.

08:30.067 --> 08:31.400
I've gotta go.

08:31.467 --> 08:33.833
See ya, Dorky!

08:37.533 --> 08:39.400
Mirabel?

08:40.600 --> 08:42.333
Mirabel?

08:47.067 --> 08:48.200
Girls?

08:51.367 --> 08:52.833
Yes!

08:52.900 --> 08:55.267
Everybody's gone!

08:57.067 --> 09:00.100
Oh, I missed the girls?

09:00.167 --> 09:02.300
Oh well, you'll do.

09:02.367 --> 09:04.367
Um... thanks?

09:04.433 --> 09:07.200
Listen, to celebrate Gigi
getting into the Genius Academy,

09:07.267 --> 09:09.300
I am inviting everyone
to Bingo Night,

09:09.367 --> 09:10.367
tonight.

09:10.433 --> 09:11.667
Bingo Night?

09:11.733 --> 09:13.067
Yeah.
Invite everybody.

09:13.100 --> 09:14.300
That's really a thing?

09:14.367 --> 09:15.900
I thought it was
more like a euphemism

09:15.967 --> 09:18.867
for one of your wild nights
out on the town.

09:18.933 --> 09:20.433
Of course, it's a thing,

09:20.500 --> 09:21.633
at the Senior's Center,

09:21.700 --> 09:23.200
and you're going to love it.

09:23.267 --> 09:26.200
Do I need an AARP card
to get in?

09:27.133 --> 09:28.300
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

09:28.367 --> 09:29.367
That's nice idea, Rosa.

09:29.433 --> 09:30.567
You know, I could invite Todd.

09:30.633 --> 09:31.433
Stephanie and Alan
could come.

09:31.500 --> 09:32.567
It'll be a party.

09:32.633 --> 09:34.567
I think it should be
just family.

09:35.467 --> 09:36.467
Have it your way.

09:36.533 --> 09:37.967
I usually do.

09:38.067 --> 09:40.200
And it's a respectable
place, Ricky,

09:40.267 --> 09:42.067
so wear something nice.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.367
Um, Dad?

10:02.433 --> 10:04.933
You sure this is
the right place?

10:05.000 --> 10:07.133
It's where
Rosa said to go.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.600
I don't see
any bingo in evidence.

10:09.667 --> 10:12.133
Oh, it's the right
place, all right.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.533
Check out Bad Grandma.

10:16.333 --> 10:17.500
Mm...

10:19.967 --> 10:21.167
It's been too long, kid.

10:22.700 --> 10:26.267
You know, I think about you
all of the time.

10:26.333 --> 10:28.233
Well now,
how would I know that?

10:28.300 --> 10:29.367
Oh, I don't know.

10:29.433 --> 10:32.600
Maybe my steady stream
of letters,

10:32.667 --> 10:35.067
cards, emails?

10:36.067 --> 10:38.167
I must have pressed "delete".

10:38.233 --> 10:39.167
Rosa...

10:39.233 --> 10:41.467
I made a mistake.

10:41.533 --> 10:44.433
I've begged for forgiveness,

10:44.500 --> 10:46.767
and I usually don't do begging.

10:46.833 --> 10:50.433
And I don't usually
get cheated on.

10:52.333 --> 10:53.433
Abuela!

10:53.500 --> 10:55.467
Oh, there's my family.

10:55.533 --> 10:58.267
Come and meet them.

11:00.267 --> 11:02.733
Oh, I'm so glad
you're here.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.400
I want you to meet
my good friend, Armand.

11:04.467 --> 11:05.433
Good evening.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.600
It's nice to see you again.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.067
Oh, I forgot
that you met--

11:09.133 --> 11:10.900
We met when Ricky
was pitching.

11:10.967 --> 11:11.967
Armand,

11:12.067 --> 11:13.400
these are my beautiful
granddaughters.

11:13.467 --> 11:15.567
Mirabel, Elisa,

11:15.633 --> 11:17.267
and Gigi.

11:17.333 --> 11:18.900
Gigi, you must be
the guest of honor.

11:18.967 --> 11:20.133
I am.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.367
I have
a test for you,

11:21.433 --> 11:24.067
one that only the greatest
minds can solve.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.700
Try me.

11:25.767 --> 11:30.067
"I'm the beginning of eternity
and the end of time and space.

11:30.067 --> 11:31.567
What am I?"

11:31.633 --> 11:33.267
The letter "e."

11:34.233 --> 11:36.333
She is a genius.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.467
And the Riddler is my favorite
Batman villain, too.

11:38.533 --> 11:40.167
Busted.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.300
Abuela...

11:41.367 --> 11:42.600
is there bingo here?

11:42.667 --> 11:45.067
Uh, not really, darling.

11:45.100 --> 11:46.933
But I bet
some people get lucky.

11:47.067 --> 11:48.067
Mirabel...

11:48.133 --> 11:49.633
Uh, Rosa, Gigi was
really looking forward

11:49.700 --> 11:51.167
to playing some Bingo.

11:51.233 --> 11:52.633
Oh.

11:52.700 --> 11:55.633
Well, we don't need bingo
to have a good time.

11:55.700 --> 11:57.133
And Ricky,

11:57.200 --> 11:59.467
that lovely Latina lady
at the bar,

11:59.533 --> 12:01.100
I think she knows you.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.633
Excuse me.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.233
Uh... I-I'm sorry, do I...

12:17.300 --> 12:18.400
know you?

12:18.467 --> 12:20.367
You do now.

12:21.433 --> 12:22.833
I'm Sofia.

12:22.900 --> 12:25.667
And you're Ricky Cooper,
Rosa's son-in-law,

12:25.733 --> 12:27.400
the baseball superstar.

12:27.467 --> 12:31.333
Uh, former
baseball superstar--

12:31.400 --> 12:32.567
player.

12:32.633 --> 12:34.467
Um, I don't know
about the superstar part.

12:34.533 --> 12:36.233
Yeah, I own a gym now--

12:36.300 --> 12:37.700
Shh!

12:37.767 --> 12:39.633
Don't speak.

12:39.700 --> 12:41.067
Just stand there
and look pretty.

12:42.700 --> 12:44.433
Who's Dad talking to?

12:44.500 --> 12:47.700
Oh, I think your dad's
found a new friend.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.067
Or maybe you found him
a new friend.

12:50.067 --> 12:52.233
Be right back.

12:59.233 --> 13:01.067
Sofia.

13:01.133 --> 13:03.233
Armand...

13:03.300 --> 13:04.500
You look as lovely
in that dress

13:04.567 --> 13:06.100
as you did
on Cinco de Mayo.

13:06.167 --> 13:08.300
How do you remember that?

13:08.367 --> 13:09.667
I never forget
a beautiful lady

13:09.733 --> 13:11.200
in a beautiful dress.

13:11.267 --> 13:13.533
Would you forgive me

13:13.600 --> 13:16.267
if I, uh, steal Ricky
for a minute?

13:18.633 --> 13:22.300
This was supposed to be
a nice night for Gigi,

13:22.367 --> 13:25.200
not Rosa setting me up
with Miss Venezuela!

13:25.267 --> 13:27.133
She's killing two birds.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.433
She's giving a nice party
for Gigi,

13:29.500 --> 13:33.067
and she's trying to find you
a nice Latina girl.

13:33.133 --> 13:34.300
I know how she thinks.

13:34.367 --> 13:35.400
So do I,

13:35.467 --> 13:36.433
and I'm going to tell her,

13:36.500 --> 13:37.633
and Sofia,

13:37.700 --> 13:38.767
that this isn't happening.

13:38.833 --> 13:40.233
You can try,

13:40.300 --> 13:41.800
but she's got two on deck.

13:48.667 --> 13:51.167
Okay, okay, I'm sorry
to disappoint Rosa

13:51.233 --> 13:53.167
and all the Sofias--

13:53.233 --> 13:54.433
and Todd--

13:54.500 --> 13:55.567
but I'm leaving,
I'm gonna go get the girls.

13:55.633 --> 13:57.300
Wait, wait,
you can't do that.

13:57.367 --> 13:58.433
She's not going
to let that happen.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.600
She's gone
to too much trouble

13:59.667 --> 14:01.767
to find you Senora Right.

14:03.400 --> 14:05.633
Okay.
Okay, so what do we do?

14:05.700 --> 14:07.800
I'll distract her.

14:07.867 --> 14:09.567
You take the kids,

14:09.633 --> 14:11.267
I'll make your amends.

14:11.333 --> 14:14.300
I'll tell her that, uh, Gigi had
one Shirley Temple too many.

14:15.333 --> 14:16.533
That's a solid game plan.

14:16.600 --> 14:17.933
I owe you one, Armand.

14:18.067 --> 14:21.200
Yeah, well,
I have an ulterior motive.

14:21.267 --> 14:22.533
I need a favor.

14:23.600 --> 14:24.767
You get me outta this?

14:24.833 --> 14:25.833
Anything.

14:25.900 --> 14:28.133
Give me a 10-second lead.

14:38.500 --> 14:39.900
They're so cute.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.200
Hey, hey!

14:42.267 --> 14:43.400
Come on, girls,
we're outta here.

14:43.467 --> 14:44.500
-What?
-We just got here.

14:44.567 --> 14:46.267
I'm sorry, Gigi.

14:46.333 --> 14:47.767
We'll celebrate
tomorrow night, okay?

14:47.833 --> 14:48.867
Bowling!

14:48.933 --> 14:49.833
I promise.

14:49.900 --> 14:51.200
What about Abuela?

14:52.267 --> 14:53.667
Oh, she'll understand.

14:53.733 --> 14:55.500
Let's go this way,
out the back door.

15:02.733 --> 15:03.833
Hey, Mirabel.

15:03.900 --> 15:04.800
Gigi.

15:04.867 --> 15:06.367
Whatcha doin'?

15:06.433 --> 15:07.833
Just some
extra homework.

15:07.900 --> 15:10.633
Since I finished all
my regular homework last night.

15:10.700 --> 15:11.633
Seriously?

15:11.700 --> 15:13.367
At 7:00 a.m.?

15:13.433 --> 15:15.300
"Early to bed
and early to rise

15:15.367 --> 15:17.367
makes a girl healthy,
wealthy, and wise."

15:17.433 --> 15:19.200
B. Franklin.

15:19.267 --> 15:20.700
I changed "man" to "girl."

15:20.767 --> 15:22.767
Well, take a break, wise girl.

15:22.833 --> 15:24.133
I got you something.

15:24.200 --> 15:25.833
Really? You did?

15:25.900 --> 15:26.867
Yeah.

15:26.933 --> 15:28.700
Just a little gift

15:28.767 --> 15:29.933
for being gifted.

15:30.067 --> 15:32.833
Look at you
with your wordplay.

15:37.667 --> 15:39.100
Whoa!

15:39.167 --> 15:40.933
Your bedazzled phone?

15:41.067 --> 15:42.567
It's actually
my old phone.

15:42.633 --> 15:43.800
I just got a new one,

15:43.867 --> 15:45.267
and I thought
that this might help you

15:45.333 --> 15:46.467
keep track of your new life.

15:46.533 --> 15:48.333
I mean,
with the whole entire

15:48.400 --> 15:49.600
Edison Academy thing,

15:49.667 --> 15:51.800
you're gonna make
twice as many friends now.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.300
Friends.

15:55.367 --> 15:56.400
Right.

15:56.467 --> 15:57.833
What?

15:57.900 --> 15:59.900
You don't like it?

16:00.067 --> 16:02.633
You could always...
unbedazzle it.

16:02.700 --> 16:05.267
No, that's not it.

16:05.333 --> 16:07.933
So, what is it?

16:08.067 --> 16:11.600
Gigi, you seem upset.

16:11.667 --> 16:12.867
I'm really not.

16:12.933 --> 16:13.933
Thanks, Mirabel.

16:19.900 --> 16:23.267
Go on, add your first contact.

16:23.333 --> 16:25.400
I don't know who to put.

16:25.467 --> 16:27.567
Well, your besties, obvi.

16:27.633 --> 16:29.333
Who are your best friends?

16:29.400 --> 16:31.833
Like those girls that
you always hang out with,

16:31.900 --> 16:33.767
Evie and...

16:33.833 --> 16:35.433
Maya.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.533
I'll... do this later.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.300
Thanks.

16:39.367 --> 16:41.600
Anything for my brill sis.

16:53.467 --> 16:55.267
Rosa, the upside
of not living here

16:55.333 --> 16:57.467
is that you don't have
to slave in our kitchen.

16:57.533 --> 17:00.900
I am perfectly willing
and able to make breakfast.

17:00.967 --> 17:03.667
You mean
your Frosted Mini-Whites?

17:03.733 --> 17:05.233
I don't think so.

17:06.267 --> 17:07.233
Hola, Abuela.

17:07.300 --> 17:08.300
Hola.

17:09.400 --> 17:10.867
More Spanish?

17:10.933 --> 17:12.067
Wait, do you have a test
or something?

17:12.067 --> 17:13.233
No, I just...

17:13.300 --> 17:14.333
enjoy speaking

17:14.400 --> 17:16.067
the language
of my ancestors.

17:18.067 --> 17:20.567
Uh, Ricky,

17:20.633 --> 17:23.633
your daughter and I need
to have a conversation.

17:23.700 --> 17:25.833
-We do?
-So have a conversation.

17:25.900 --> 17:28.967
A woman-to-woman
conversation.

17:29.067 --> 17:32.433
She's getting very close
to being a teenager,

17:32.500 --> 17:33.700
and she's going through
a lot of changes,

17:33.767 --> 17:35.167
you know what I mean--

17:35.233 --> 17:36.533
Alrighty, then!

17:36.600 --> 17:38.567
I think I'll go take out
the trash bins.

17:38.633 --> 17:39.467
It's only
Wednesday, Dad.

17:39.533 --> 17:40.533
Whatever.

17:43.333 --> 17:44.333
What woman stuff, Abuela?

17:44.400 --> 17:45.800
Talk to me in a year.

17:45.867 --> 17:47.967
I just needed
to get rid of your dad.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.500
Okay then.

17:49.567 --> 17:52.233
I'm guessing this is about
Operation Pump Up the Latino?

17:52.300 --> 17:53.433
Yes.

17:53.500 --> 17:55.667
And your father
just doesn't get it.

17:56.667 --> 17:58.633
All right, I'll try,

17:58.700 --> 18:00.467
but I'm not sure
how much more I can do.

18:00.533 --> 18:01.933
Well, be creative.

18:02.067 --> 18:04.833
And eat your huevos rancheros.

18:04.900 --> 18:06.967
Um... Abuela?

18:07.067 --> 18:09.333
I don't actually like
huevos rancheros.

18:09.400 --> 18:10.367
Fake it.

18:16.767 --> 18:18.633
Did you see
Sally's shoes?

18:18.700 --> 18:19.900
They're, like,
so last year.

18:21.167 --> 18:22.767
I don't even know
how she can wear those.

18:23.933 --> 18:24.800
Gigi...

18:24.867 --> 18:26.733
After the Revolution,

18:26.800 --> 18:28.067
can you tell me
what the newly formed states

18:28.133 --> 18:29.633
called themselves?

18:29.700 --> 18:30.800
Yeah.

18:30.867 --> 18:32.600
You mean like, New York,

18:32.667 --> 18:33.567
New Mexico,

18:33.633 --> 18:35.067
New Rochelle?

18:35.100 --> 18:37.467
They all just put, like, "new"
in their names, right?

18:37.533 --> 18:39.633
Gigi, are you trying
to be funny,

18:39.700 --> 18:41.400
or do you want
to try that again?

18:42.667 --> 18:45.067
I don't know, do you?

18:48.433 --> 18:49.800
I need you to go
to the principal's office

18:49.867 --> 18:50.833
right now.

18:57.667 --> 18:58.800
Oh, my gosh.
That's so bad.

19:01.767 --> 19:05.400
The thing is,
I still love Rosa.

19:05.467 --> 19:07.067
She's all I think about.

19:07.133 --> 19:08.567
Her eyes.

19:08.633 --> 19:09.700
Her hair.

19:09.767 --> 19:11.733
The way she yells
at the telemarketers

19:11.800 --> 19:13.167
that call after 7:00.

19:13.900 --> 19:16.967
Okay, but haven't you two
been down that road before?

19:17.067 --> 19:18.633
It didn't end well,
as I recall.

19:18.700 --> 19:19.967
I mean, I remember
flying plates,

19:20.067 --> 19:21.467
and bilingual obscenities.

19:21.533 --> 19:23.400
She had every right.

19:23.467 --> 19:25.467
I was unfaithful to her.

19:28.700 --> 19:29.833
Um, Alan,

19:29.900 --> 19:31.300
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

19:31.367 --> 19:33.533
What do you need?

19:33.600 --> 19:35.400
Nothing.

19:35.467 --> 19:37.900
I mean, I just
wanted to say...

19:37.967 --> 19:39.667
and I wasn't eavesdropping,
but I do read lips,

19:39.733 --> 19:40.833
because my Aunt Susie
was deaf,

19:40.900 --> 19:42.833
so I do know how to sign...

19:42.900 --> 19:45.467
I just wanted to say

19:45.533 --> 19:49.667
that I have enormous respect
and admiration for Rosa,

19:49.733 --> 19:52.700
and the depth
of your feeling for her

19:52.767 --> 19:54.800
is, well, it's just,
it's super moving.

19:56.667 --> 20:00.000
And she would be loco--
or loca-- or-or-or--

20:00.000 --> 20:00.067
And she would be loco--
or loca-- or-or-or--
My Spanish isn't great,
it's not as good as my signing.

20:00.067 --> 20:02.600
My Spanish isn't great,
it's not as good as my signing.

20:02.667 --> 20:04.133
--if she didn't take you back.

20:05.867 --> 20:08.667
Also, the name Armand
is incredibly sexy.

20:14.033 --> 20:15.533
Okay.

20:21.800 --> 20:24.100
I-I'm sorry about that.

20:24.167 --> 20:25.367
He's just a little, uh...

20:25.433 --> 20:26.333
Enthusiastic?

20:26.400 --> 20:27.000
Yeah.

20:27.067 --> 20:28.700
I got it.

20:28.767 --> 20:29.900
Ricky...

20:29.967 --> 20:31.933
talk to her for me.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.933
Find out if there's
a chance for me

20:35.000 --> 20:37.967
to have some kind of a permanent
relationship with her, huh?

20:38.033 --> 20:39.033
Talk to Rosa.

20:39.100 --> 20:40.733
Yeah, I'll feel her out.

20:42.667 --> 20:43.733
That, uh...

20:43.800 --> 20:45.133
This came out wrong.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.867
Thanks, kid.

20:46.933 --> 20:50.000
You may be the only person
she listens to.

20:52.133 --> 20:53.433
Hmm.

20:56.833 --> 20:57.800
Boom!

20:59.167 --> 21:01.967
The Big Coopowksi
is on his way to another 300.

21:02.067 --> 21:04.533
This beats Bingo Night,
am I right, ladies?

21:04.600 --> 21:05.533
Sí, Ricardo.

21:05.600 --> 21:06.800
I love el....

21:08.667 --> 21:10.233
...bowling?

21:10.300 --> 21:12.200
This is a more
family-friendly venue.

21:12.267 --> 21:14.867
Abuela's choice was
semi-inappropriate for minors.

21:14.933 --> 21:16.533
My turn.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.067
Mirabel?

21:24.100 --> 21:25.067
Mm-hmm?

21:25.133 --> 21:26.967
What are you doing?

21:27.067 --> 21:29.767
You seriously don't expect me
to just put my fingers in there

21:29.833 --> 21:31.467
without degerming first?

21:31.533 --> 21:32.867
Oh, no...

21:41.333 --> 21:42.900
That's not really
how you're supposed to...

21:44.067 --> 21:45.067
do...

21:51.100 --> 21:52.067
...it. Wow.

21:53.933 --> 21:55.467
Thank you.

21:55.533 --> 21:57.067
I wish Liam had seen that.

21:57.067 --> 21:59.133
Ah, someone send
an emergency text.

22:00.400 --> 22:01.567
I'm gonna get us
some more beverages.

22:12.067 --> 22:12.933
Ricky?

22:14.067 --> 22:15.933
This is random.

22:16.067 --> 22:17.067
Steph!

22:17.067 --> 22:19.533
Well, it's not that random.

22:19.600 --> 22:22.200
I'm a single dad
with three kids.

22:22.267 --> 22:24.067
It would be weird
if you didn't run into me

22:24.067 --> 22:24.967
in a place like this.

22:26.067 --> 22:27.067
What are you doing here?

22:27.067 --> 22:29.900
Maybe I love bowling.

22:29.967 --> 22:32.667
You know, 30% of people
who go to Disneyland

22:32.733 --> 22:34.167
don't even have kids.

22:39.367 --> 22:42.067
Uh, what's the percentage
of them on dates?

22:43.800 --> 22:45.067
Busted.

22:45.067 --> 22:46.867
I have a weakness

22:46.933 --> 22:48.933
for nice, skinny guys
with glasses.

22:51.933 --> 22:54.733
Okay, so he does own
his own bowling shoes.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.600
Okay, wait, wait, wait,

22:56.667 --> 22:57.767
but don't tell me,

22:57.833 --> 22:59.733
he's a really sweet guy.

23:00.833 --> 23:01.833
He is.

23:05.767 --> 23:07.200
Honestly,

23:07.267 --> 23:10.067
I've been so stressed out
juggling work and school,

23:10.100 --> 23:13.733
I said yes to the first guy
who swiped right.

23:15.700 --> 23:17.800
Oh, I-I didn't realize
it was that bad.

23:17.867 --> 23:19.200
I mean, do you need fewer hours?

23:19.267 --> 23:20.933
Go part-time?

23:21.067 --> 23:21.900
Would that help?

23:21.967 --> 23:23.767
Thanks, but it-it won't.

23:23.833 --> 23:25.267
I still have to take care
of my mom,

23:25.333 --> 23:26.733
and my little brother.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.867
He's got special needs,

23:28.933 --> 23:31.200
and so I have to work
full-time,

23:31.267 --> 23:32.667
and go to school
full-time,

23:32.733 --> 23:33.867
which is not free.

23:33.933 --> 23:35.300
At all.

23:35.367 --> 23:38.967
Tuition is a killer.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.067
And now
I'm thinking about it

23:42.100 --> 23:44.533
when I should be relaxing.

23:44.600 --> 23:45.900
So, uh...

23:45.967 --> 23:47.767
I'm gonna go.

23:47.833 --> 23:49.133
But, uh...

23:50.133 --> 23:51.067
I'll see ya tomorrow.

23:51.100 --> 23:52.900
See ya.

24:01.067 --> 24:02.300
Oh!

24:25.333 --> 24:27.233
Hey, Steph.

24:27.300 --> 24:28.733
What's with the music?

24:28.800 --> 24:30.800
It's like a Pitbull
concert out there.

24:30.867 --> 24:32.833
I assumed you had okay'd it.

24:32.900 --> 24:34.333
Elisa sent me over
a playlist this morning.

24:34.400 --> 24:35.900
She said, "This is for my papi,"

24:35.967 --> 24:36.967
and I just went with it.

24:37.067 --> 24:38.200
She did?

24:38.267 --> 24:39.433
Well, that's news to me.

24:39.500 --> 24:42.367
I figured
it was a marketing strategy.

24:42.433 --> 24:43.767
It wasn't your idea?

24:43.833 --> 24:45.500
No.

24:45.567 --> 24:48.067
Oh, but I think I know
whose it was.

24:48.133 --> 24:49.367
Really? Whose?

24:49.433 --> 24:50.967
A certain Latina mother-in-law,

24:51.067 --> 24:52.067
who I need to call

24:52.133 --> 24:55.200
and give a piece
of my gringo mind.

24:57.300 --> 24:58.933
Who is that?

25:00.900 --> 25:03.233
Oh, uh, that's Thor.

25:03.300 --> 25:05.233
He's new.

25:06.433 --> 25:07.567
Remember?

25:07.633 --> 25:09.533
You said we needed
to take on another trainer

25:09.600 --> 25:12.200
because of the bump
in membership?

25:12.267 --> 25:13.400
Which is part
of the reason

25:13.467 --> 25:15.433
I've been working
overtime lately.

25:15.500 --> 25:17.933
You approved his resume,

25:18.067 --> 25:19.900
you said you didn't need
to interview him,

25:19.967 --> 25:22.400
and that if I liked him,
that was good enough.

25:22.467 --> 25:24.367
We had a whole
conversation.

25:24.433 --> 25:25.867
Yeah, I think
I'd remember

25:25.933 --> 25:27.567
a guy named Thor.

25:27.633 --> 25:30.100
Oh, well, that's not
his actual name.

25:30.167 --> 25:32.233
It's more of a nickname.

25:32.300 --> 25:33.433
I gave it to him,

25:33.500 --> 25:34.933
but he likes it.

25:35.067 --> 25:36.200
His whole family
is Scandinavian.

25:36.267 --> 25:38.800
They're like 6'5",
blond, gorgeous....

25:38.867 --> 25:40.067
His real name is Bjorn.

25:40.967 --> 25:41.967
Bjorn...

25:42.067 --> 25:43.400
Yeah, maybe I remember that.

25:43.467 --> 25:46.167
It's, uh, pronounced "Byuurrn."

25:46.233 --> 25:48.233
It's got an umlaut.

25:48.300 --> 25:49.533
Is it really?

25:49.600 --> 25:51.133
Does he come with subtitles?

25:51.200 --> 25:52.233
No, no, he speaks English.

25:52.300 --> 25:53.267
Joke.

25:53.333 --> 25:55.067
Steph, it's a joke.

25:55.133 --> 25:56.367
Oh.

25:56.433 --> 25:57.433
Right.

25:57.500 --> 25:58.833
Wait, so
what happened

25:58.900 --> 26:01.100
with your weakness
for skinny guys with glasses?

26:01.167 --> 26:03.067
Yeah...

26:05.367 --> 26:07.500
I may be over that.

26:07.567 --> 26:09.667
I'm gonna go see
if he needs help.

26:09.733 --> 26:12.200
You know, with
the vending machines, or...

26:12.267 --> 26:13.567
anything.

26:13.633 --> 26:14.900
Yeah, yeah, you do that.

26:30.067 --> 26:30.967
I.D.

26:32.600 --> 26:33.533
Get her I.D.

26:33.600 --> 26:35.100
I.D.!

26:38.167 --> 26:39.100
Oh, you mean in the drawer?

26:44.933 --> 26:46.700
My mime's a little rusty,

26:46.767 --> 26:48.067
I thought you said
it was in my drawer?

26:48.133 --> 26:49.533
No, "drawers", plural.

26:49.600 --> 26:50.967
Drawers.

26:51.067 --> 26:52.067
I noticed that you bought
some new stuff for the gym.

26:52.067 --> 26:53.067
Socks.

26:53.067 --> 26:55.400
I put it...

26:55.467 --> 26:56.867
in your underwear.

26:58.233 --> 26:59.900
I have the same underwear!

27:00.067 --> 27:01.233
I didn't even realize that.

27:01.667 --> 27:04.067
Put my underwear down, Alan.
Thank you.

27:05.100 --> 27:06.167
Look at that I.D.

27:06.233 --> 27:07.067
She looks adorable
in her photos,

27:07.100 --> 27:08.767
doesn't she?

27:08.833 --> 27:10.933
My I.D.s always end up looking
axe-murdery.

27:18.067 --> 27:20.267
I'm not going to ask
what you're doing.

27:20.333 --> 27:22.200
Good.

27:22.267 --> 27:23.533
Do you mind?

27:23.600 --> 27:24.433
Right.

27:29.067 --> 27:30.733
But I think I know
what you're doing,

27:30.800 --> 27:33.067
and let me just say
what you're doing

27:33.100 --> 27:34.067
is gonna mean
so much to Stephanie,

27:34.133 --> 27:35.300
you have no clue.

27:35.367 --> 27:37.133
Or maybe you do.

27:41.667 --> 27:45.467
You're a good man,
Ricky Cooper.

27:45.533 --> 27:48.333
Do not say anything to her.

27:51.467 --> 27:52.400
You know, I was thinking

27:52.467 --> 27:53.833
about a degree
in cosmetology.

27:53.900 --> 27:55.067
Back to work, Alan.

27:55.100 --> 27:56.533
Sorry, boss.

27:56.600 --> 27:57.600
I sullied the moment.

27:58.600 --> 27:59.600
I was never here.

28:04.500 --> 28:05.700
I'll see you later.

28:18.800 --> 28:20.467
You ready
to say good-night?

28:20.533 --> 28:22.067
Daddy?

28:22.133 --> 28:23.233
Yeah?

28:23.300 --> 28:25.467
What would you say
if I told you

28:25.533 --> 28:27.600
I'm not really loving
the Edison Academy?

28:30.167 --> 28:31.567
It's just that...

28:31.633 --> 28:33.467
it's a lot of extra work.

28:33.533 --> 28:34.667
And distant,

28:34.733 --> 28:36.733
for you, commute-wise.

28:38.167 --> 28:39.300
Wait, what?

28:39.367 --> 28:42.067
It seemed like that place
was made for you.

28:42.133 --> 28:44.067
I don't mind taking you there
after school.

28:44.133 --> 28:45.233
I'm happy to.

28:45.300 --> 28:47.133
Do I have to do it?

28:47.200 --> 28:48.467
No.

28:48.533 --> 28:50.467
No, I would never force you
to do anything

28:50.533 --> 28:52.067
you didn't want to do.

28:53.633 --> 28:54.767
Gigi?

28:54.833 --> 28:57.067
What aren't you telling me,
sweetie?

28:57.100 --> 28:59.133
I'm not telling you

28:59.200 --> 29:00.700
that I'm losing
all my so-called friends

29:00.767 --> 29:02.133
because of the "Dork Academy,"

29:02.200 --> 29:03.767
so I acted dumb
on purpose,

29:03.833 --> 29:07.733
and I got sent to
the vice principal's office.

29:09.433 --> 29:10.667
Here's the note.

29:14.400 --> 29:17.333
Wow, that's a first.

29:17.400 --> 29:21.300
I mean, Mirabel got so many
of these in Middle School,

29:21.367 --> 29:22.500
I had them bound.

29:22.567 --> 29:24.200
Oh, Daddy,

29:24.267 --> 29:26.333
I feel so ashamed,
and embarrassed,

29:26.400 --> 29:28.067
and low-self-esteem-y.

29:28.133 --> 29:30.233
I don't know what to do.

29:30.300 --> 29:32.367
You know, when I was your age,

29:32.433 --> 29:36.400
I started playing for this
really good club baseball team.

29:36.467 --> 29:37.900
They traveled
all over the state,

29:37.967 --> 29:40.467
sometimes across the country
for these big tournaments.

29:40.533 --> 29:42.833
A bunch of my friends tried out,

29:42.900 --> 29:44.467
but I was the only one
that made the team.

29:46.233 --> 29:47.467
Yeah, I thought
they'd be happy,

29:47.533 --> 29:49.300
but, um...

29:49.367 --> 29:51.800
you know,
they got all jealous and weird,

29:51.867 --> 29:55.133
and, you know, some of them
stopped hanging out with me.

29:56.200 --> 29:57.867
Now, I could have quit,

29:57.933 --> 30:01.267
you know, and maybe I'd still
be friends with them,

30:01.333 --> 30:02.333
but I couldn't do that.

30:02.400 --> 30:03.333
You know why?

30:04.733 --> 30:06.000
'Cause you didn't want to.

30:06.067 --> 30:07.500
Exactly.

30:07.567 --> 30:09.000
Baseball was my passion.

30:09.067 --> 30:10.600
It was everything to me.

30:10.667 --> 30:15.100
Just like pre-astrophysics
is to you.

30:15.167 --> 30:18.200
Now, I'd never want you
to give that up,

30:18.267 --> 30:20.333
and I don't think
you want that, either.

30:20.400 --> 30:22.200
I don't want to quit
the Academy.

30:22.267 --> 30:24.167
Not until that girl shows me

30:24.233 --> 30:26.433
how she does that Rubik's cube
behind the back thing.

30:28.867 --> 30:30.267
There might be
mirrors involved.

30:31.633 --> 30:34.267
Thanks, Dad.

30:34.333 --> 30:35.367
For a jock,
you're pretty smart.

30:39.333 --> 30:40.533
Get some sleep.

30:40.600 --> 30:41.633
Okay.

30:54.667 --> 30:56.100
Rosa, can we talk?

30:56.167 --> 30:57.567
Now is not a good time.

30:57.633 --> 31:00.633
I'm just teaching her
the Cha Cha Cha.

31:04.867 --> 31:06.633
Mirabel, bedtime.

31:06.700 --> 31:08.367
Dance lesson's over.

31:08.433 --> 31:11.167
But I'm just
starting to get this.

31:11.233 --> 31:12.567
Dance means
so much to Liam.

31:12.633 --> 31:13.567
I don't want
to let him down.

31:13.633 --> 31:15.233
Yeah...

31:15.300 --> 31:17.833
I wish his curveball
meant a little more to him.

31:17.900 --> 31:20.300
Your boyfriend got shelled
in the last game.

31:20.367 --> 31:23.400
Besides, you need
your beauty rest, right?

31:23.467 --> 31:25.300
Don't want Liam to see you
with raccoon eyes.

31:25.367 --> 31:26.767
OMG.

31:26.833 --> 31:28.267
I have raccoon eyes?

31:28.333 --> 31:30.300
I'm going to bed,
like, stat.

31:30.367 --> 31:31.267
Thanks, Abuela.

31:31.333 --> 31:32.233
'Night, Dad.

31:32.300 --> 31:33.600
-'Night.
-Night.

31:38.267 --> 31:39.267
So, talk.

31:39.333 --> 31:42.333
I know about
Operation Latino.

31:42.400 --> 31:46.067
F.Y.I., it's called
Operation Pump Up the Latino,

31:46.133 --> 31:47.467
but go ahead.

31:47.533 --> 31:49.800
Rosa... Rosa, it's one thing
to get all worked up

31:49.867 --> 31:52.733
about the family going
too whitebread, or whatever,

31:52.800 --> 31:56.300
but you can't rope the girls
into your schemes.

31:56.367 --> 31:58.767
Well, Elisa volunteered.

31:58.833 --> 32:01.867
No, you mean
you volunteered her.

32:01.933 --> 32:03.367
I talked to her

32:03.433 --> 32:06.333
after she turned my gym
into the Miami Sound Machine.

32:06.400 --> 32:07.567
Guilty, okay?

32:07.633 --> 32:09.600
Guilty.

32:13.367 --> 32:14.700
But this is
important to me.

32:14.767 --> 32:17.367
You're not just my son-in-law,

32:17.433 --> 32:18.467
you're my son.

32:18.533 --> 32:19.900
That's why I found you

32:19.967 --> 32:22.300
all those beautiful
Latina girls.

32:22.367 --> 32:24.467
I don't know
who you're going to end up with.

32:26.267 --> 32:27.533
Look...

32:27.600 --> 32:29.933
I appreciate that,

32:30.067 --> 32:34.267
and I know what this is about.

32:34.333 --> 32:35.733
This is about Isabella.

32:37.567 --> 32:42.967
But I didn't marry Isabella
because she was Latina.

32:43.067 --> 32:46.167
I married her
because she was Isabella.

32:46.233 --> 32:47.700
I know that.

32:47.767 --> 32:50.800
I'm just worried that
her memory will fade,

32:50.867 --> 32:53.467
and I don't want the color
to go out of this family.

32:53.533 --> 32:55.633
That's never going to happen.

32:55.700 --> 32:57.600
I'll never
let that happen, okay?

32:58.967 --> 33:00.400
Okay.

33:03.833 --> 33:06.467
So, how are things with Armand?

33:07.600 --> 33:10.700
He's a great guy,
the girls love him.

33:10.767 --> 33:11.867
Are you gonna take him back
or what?

33:11.933 --> 33:14.367
Oh, I don't know.

33:14.433 --> 33:16.633
Armand...

33:16.700 --> 33:19.333
He is handsome, and charming,

33:19.400 --> 33:20.833
and a magnificent lover.

33:20.900 --> 33:23.500
Uh, I-I'm good with
the handsome and charming.

33:25.067 --> 33:29.533
You know, Armand is
crazy-stupid-in-love with you.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.867
So if you're not
serious about him,

33:31.933 --> 33:34.533
I think you should let him know.

33:35.733 --> 33:36.800
Okay.

33:38.500 --> 33:39.367
What was that?

33:43.667 --> 33:45.467
I'm going
to check on the girls.

33:46.800 --> 33:47.933
Whoa-- Steph.

33:48.067 --> 33:48.833
What's going on?

33:48.900 --> 33:49.900
Hey, Boss.

33:49.967 --> 33:51.767
Yeah, that was me,

33:51.833 --> 33:54.467
knocking over
the recycling bins...

33:54.533 --> 33:55.867
with my car.

33:55.933 --> 33:57.667
I was never much
of a parallel parker.

33:57.733 --> 33:59.867
In Gym, I was always better
at the uneven bars

34:00.067 --> 34:02.600
than I was
at the parallel bars.

34:02.667 --> 34:05.933
So, why exactly are you
knocking over my trash bins?

34:06.067 --> 34:09.067
Because I couldn't wait
till tomorrow to tell you

34:09.133 --> 34:11.433
that what you did
is, without a doubt,

34:11.500 --> 34:13.700
one of the nicest things
anyone has ever done for me.

34:15.333 --> 34:16.433
Alan blabbed.

34:16.500 --> 34:17.800
No!

34:17.867 --> 34:19.500
I saw it when I logged into
my school account,

34:19.567 --> 34:20.900
and...

34:20.967 --> 34:22.967
Yes, Alan blabbed.

34:23.067 --> 34:25.333
He is so fired.

34:26.467 --> 34:27.967
I don't know
what to say, but...

34:28.067 --> 34:29.433
thank you.

34:29.500 --> 34:30.867
And thank you!

34:30.933 --> 34:32.600
You're welcome,

34:32.667 --> 34:34.333
and you're welcome.

34:34.400 --> 34:36.300
But, um...

34:37.367 --> 34:40.733
But... what?

34:40.800 --> 34:42.667
I can't accept it.

34:42.733 --> 34:44.233
W...Why not?

34:44.300 --> 34:45.467
I have the money.

34:45.533 --> 34:46.400
You don't...

34:46.467 --> 34:48.067
I mean, not right now anyway.

34:48.100 --> 34:50.833
I was taught
never to accept charity,

34:50.900 --> 34:52.600
especially from a friend.

34:52.667 --> 34:54.600
It's not charity.

34:54.667 --> 34:56.467
And don't look at me
as a friend.

34:56.533 --> 34:57.533
You're my employee,

34:57.600 --> 34:59.600
and it's
in my business interest

34:59.667 --> 35:02.467
to have more highly-qualified
people working for me.

35:02.533 --> 35:04.133
You get that degree,
it just makes me look good.

35:05.467 --> 35:07.400
Well, that...
that sounds reasonable,

35:07.467 --> 35:08.767
but I...

35:08.833 --> 35:11.700
I'm still not comfortable.

35:12.867 --> 35:15.400
What would make you
comfortable?

35:15.467 --> 35:17.800
I don't know, I...

35:17.867 --> 35:19.967
I guess if it was a loan.

35:20.067 --> 35:22.500
I've got plenty of school loans.

35:22.567 --> 35:23.933
One more won't kill me.

35:24.067 --> 35:25.700
All right, on the condition

35:25.767 --> 35:27.200
that you don't pay this one back

35:27.267 --> 35:29.100
until you've paid off
the real ones.

35:29.167 --> 35:30.600
The other ones.

35:31.700 --> 35:33.067
Deal.

35:41.967 --> 35:44.933
Uh, do you want, uh,
you know, some coffee, or...

35:45.067 --> 35:47.433
The-the Angels game
is about to come on.

35:47.500 --> 35:49.533
Oh, that sounds fun,

35:49.600 --> 35:50.733
but I...

35:50.800 --> 35:51.967
I have class.

35:52.067 --> 35:54.100
Which is now fully paid for,

35:54.167 --> 35:55.667
so...

35:55.733 --> 35:56.867
thank you so very much.

36:04.867 --> 36:08.067
You're a good boss,
Ricky Cooper.

36:11.600 --> 36:12.433
Bye.

36:12.500 --> 36:13.100
Bye.

36:14.100 --> 36:14.967
Watch those bins.

36:15.067 --> 36:15.967
Yup.

36:25.967 --> 36:29.733
Oh, Armand, mi amor.

36:29.800 --> 36:32.800
I am... beyond flattered.

36:32.867 --> 36:35.233
Then you accept?

36:35.300 --> 36:37.200
You make me
the happiest man alive.

36:38.700 --> 36:40.933
My darling, I'm not sure
I'm ready for that.

36:41.067 --> 36:43.067
I just want
to keep on playing

36:43.067 --> 36:44.567
the bingo game of love

36:44.633 --> 36:47.067
until I'm too old
to dance in high heels.

36:47.067 --> 36:49.100
Which will never happen.

36:49.167 --> 36:54.867
But I cannot accept a proposal
from a man I don't trust.

36:58.067 --> 36:59.767
You know what Casanova said?

36:59.833 --> 37:02.500
No, but I bet you do.

37:02.567 --> 37:04.733
"When I grew older,

37:04.800 --> 37:07.633
"the thing that attracted me
more and more to women

37:07.700 --> 37:10.067
was intelligence."

37:11.267 --> 37:14.600
So I'm smart not to trust you.

37:14.667 --> 37:16.933
No, you're smart enough to see
that I want you

37:17.067 --> 37:19.533
and only you.

37:21.967 --> 37:22.900
Oh.

37:22.967 --> 37:24.067
Rosa?

37:24.100 --> 37:25.067
Yes?

37:26.900 --> 37:29.200
Dance with me.

37:29.267 --> 37:31.500
But it's the middle of the day.

37:31.567 --> 37:33.633
It's midnight somewhere.

37:54.567 --> 37:56.167
Hey, Madame Curie.

37:56.233 --> 37:57.833
Have you ever looked
at Mirabel's hair

37:57.900 --> 38:00.067
under a microscope?

38:00.067 --> 38:01.733
It's mostly product.

38:01.800 --> 38:03.167
I'm not even sure
there's any actual hair.

38:03.233 --> 38:04.867
I believe it.

38:04.933 --> 38:06.567
I pay those bills.

38:06.633 --> 38:08.167
You got a second?

38:08.233 --> 38:10.967
There's something
I want to give you.

38:13.167 --> 38:15.333
Buenas noches, Abuela.

38:15.400 --> 38:17.767
Oh, nice accent, Elisa.

38:17.833 --> 38:19.733
But, uh, I'm afraid

38:19.800 --> 38:22.267
Operation Pump Up
has been deflated.

38:22.333 --> 38:23.733
Phew.

38:23.800 --> 38:24.800
That was a lot of work.

38:25.733 --> 38:27.367
I mean, I didn't mind,

38:27.433 --> 38:29.200
but the whole thing felt
a little forced.

38:29.267 --> 38:32.167
I'm sorry, that's my fault.

38:32.233 --> 38:34.567
I-- Sometimes, I go too far.

38:34.633 --> 38:35.567
Sometimes?

38:35.633 --> 38:36.733
Okay, all the time.

38:38.167 --> 38:40.300
But it wasn't right for me
to involve you that way.

38:40.367 --> 38:42.133
It's okay, Abuela.

38:42.200 --> 38:43.900
I like speaking Spanish.

38:43.967 --> 38:45.200
It reminds me of Mom.

38:45.267 --> 38:46.200
Aw...

38:46.267 --> 38:47.133
Me too.

38:48.867 --> 38:51.700
Mm, good night,
sweetheart.

38:51.767 --> 38:52.667
Wait!

38:52.733 --> 38:54.267
I wanted to ask
how it's going

38:54.333 --> 38:56.067
with that nice gentleman
from Bingo Night?

38:56.133 --> 38:57.600
Is he going to be
our new grandpa?

38:57.667 --> 38:59.233
Armand?

38:59.300 --> 39:02.233
Oh, he's one charming man,

39:02.300 --> 39:04.367
but it would be rather unfair

39:04.433 --> 39:07.067
for me to limit myself
to just one,

39:07.133 --> 39:09.167
don't you think?

39:09.233 --> 39:10.633
Buenas Noches.

39:10.700 --> 39:11.767
Oh.

39:18.367 --> 39:20.267
I've been giving some
of your mother's jewelry

39:20.333 --> 39:22.367
to your sisters,

39:22.433 --> 39:25.200
and I want you
to have this one.

39:25.267 --> 39:27.367
Her charm bracelet?

39:27.433 --> 39:31.733
She was wearing it
the first time we met.

39:34.333 --> 39:37.667
I remember, she always wanted me
to put it on her.

39:39.733 --> 39:41.833
There we go.

39:43.233 --> 39:44.967
Anyway...

39:45.067 --> 39:47.967
I want it to be yours,

39:48.067 --> 39:50.067
for owning who you are.

39:51.333 --> 39:53.433
Like your mother
always did,

39:53.500 --> 39:57.067
not letting other people
define you.

39:57.067 --> 39:59.267
You're Gigi,

39:59.333 --> 40:02.400
and that's the only label
you'll ever need.

40:03.900 --> 40:06.100
Thanks, Daddy, so much.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.033
Look!

40:10.100 --> 40:11.933
One of the charms
is a little book,

40:12.000 --> 40:13.100
that's so cool!

40:14.967 --> 40:17.600
I'm going to Insta
this bracelet on my new phone.

40:17.667 --> 40:18.667
#charmed

40:18.733 --> 40:19.900
#grateful

40:19.967 --> 40:22.000
#IloveyouDad.

40:22.067 --> 40:24.267
Hashtag I love you, too.

40:39.500 --> 40:41.167
Can you pass me
my bracelet, love?

40:41.233 --> 40:42.133
Yeah.

40:43.767 --> 40:45.200
I can't believe you still
wear this every day.

40:45.267 --> 40:47.233
Of course.

40:47.300 --> 40:49.933
I feel naked without it.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.867
It reminds me of high school.

40:52.733 --> 40:53.767
Can you...?

40:53.833 --> 40:55.967
Oh, yeah.

40:57.533 --> 41:01.200
The older we get,
the more I want to remember.

41:03.133 --> 41:05.400
Well, you look the same.

41:05.467 --> 41:07.367
I'm the one getting soft.

41:07.433 --> 41:08.400
Boo-ya.

41:10.200 --> 41:13.067
Mirabel is almost
the age we were

41:13.133 --> 41:14.867
when I got this bracelet.

41:14.933 --> 41:15.933
Oh-ho-ho...

41:16.067 --> 41:17.067
Mirabel as a teenager?

41:17.133 --> 41:18.067
That's frightening.

41:18.133 --> 41:19.267
Oh, don't worry,

41:19.333 --> 41:21.867
she'll take all
her hormones out on me.

41:21.933 --> 41:24.133
Girls love their daddies.

41:24.200 --> 41:25.867
Well, at least
we have Baby Gigi.

41:25.933 --> 41:28.333
Oh, no,
now, she frightens me.

41:28.400 --> 41:30.467
You know what I caught her
doing this morning?

41:30.533 --> 41:32.300
Doodling prime numbers.

41:32.367 --> 41:34.067
Prime numbers!

41:35.600 --> 41:37.933
Well, it's a good thing
she has your brain and not mine.

41:38.067 --> 41:40.100
Well...

41:40.167 --> 41:41.967
for a jock,

41:42.067 --> 41:43.300
you're pretty smart.

41:43.367 --> 41:45.267
Huh?
