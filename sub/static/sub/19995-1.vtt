140 West Rialto Avenue,

00:17.935 --> 00:19.608
apartment Edward.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.071
this is.

00:25.359 --> 00:30.240
360 East Rialto Avenue,
apartment 47, 4-7,

00:30.531 --> 00:31.032
San Bernardino.

00:44.711 --> 00:45.428
Hi.

00:45.712 --> 00:46.804
Hey.

00:47.089 --> 00:48.011
You must be Joseph.

00:48.298 --> 00:49.470
Yep.

00:49.758 --> 00:52.511
So what's going on, Joseph?

00:52.803 --> 00:53.850
Nothing much.

00:54.137 --> 00:55.514
What do you mean,
"nothing much"?

00:55.806 --> 00:57.433
Wouldn't be here if
something's not going on.

01:02.145 --> 01:05.820
I would rather hear it from
you, your side of the thing.

01:06.108 --> 01:07.360
I just don't go
to school, I guess.

01:07.651 --> 01:08.152
Why?

01:08.443 --> 01:10.741
I never wake up.

01:11.029 --> 01:12.121
How late are we staying up?

01:12.406 --> 01:13.077
12:00.

01:13.365 --> 01:15.117
I'll wake up about 1:00.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.126
1 o'clock?

01:16.410 --> 01:18.287
In the afternoon, yeah.

01:18.579 --> 01:19.671
That's 13 hours.

01:19.955 --> 01:20.751
Are you using drugs?

01:21.039 --> 01:23.417
No.

01:23.709 --> 01:25.256
The father in the household?

01:25.544 --> 01:27.512
The stepdad?

01:27.796 --> 01:29.924
He's in prison now.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.467
And I don't want
to do high school.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.135
You don't
want to do high school?

01:33.427 --> 01:37.022
I have 'I50 credits to make
up now, for like.

01:38.724 --> 01:40.397
This is really
bothering you, isn't it?

01:40.684 --> 01:41.810
I've
done everything.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.855
I've taken-- even put
where I took his door.

01:45.147 --> 01:46.399
There was like six months
where he didn't even

01:46.690 --> 01:47.566
have a bedroom door.

01:47.858 --> 01:48.905
I took everything
out of his room.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.068
Is it still that Way?

01:50.360 --> 01:51.111
- No.
- Why not?

01:51.403 --> 01:52.154
Because he started doing good.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.493
And he does good, and then he--

01:53.780 --> 01:57.455
OK, well, what do
you want out of life?

01:57.743 --> 01:59.916
What do you expect to
get without an education?

03:29.251 --> 03:31.379
My
family's been out here forever.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.013
There's really nothing
for kids to do.

03:33.296 --> 03:36.800
Like it causes us to get
into a lot of bad things.

03:46.518 --> 03:48.771
I never
really had a childhood.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.359
Like other kids thought
the world was all happy.

03:50.647 --> 03:51.614
I tell them, like, no.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.400
The world is actually
a dark place.

04:06.455 --> 04:07.707
- I
- don't want to stay here.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.420
I want to be something.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.927
I don't care what it
is, just something.

04:51.082 --> 04:51.753
Good morning!

04:52.042 --> 04:54.010
How are you?

04:54.294 --> 04:55.386
Tired?

04:55.670 --> 04:57.297
Because you've been
working so hard, right?

04:57.589 --> 05:00.092
Good morning!

05:00.383 --> 05:01.555
Good morning Ms. Viland.

05:01.843 --> 05:02.389
Good morning.

05:02.677 --> 05:03.269
Morning, Ms. Viland.

05:03.553 --> 05:04.645
Good morning.
Hi!

05:04.930 --> 05:05.681
Good morning, Ms. Viland.

05:05.972 --> 05:06.894
You have a smile on your face!

05:07.182 --> 05:07.728
I like that.

05:08.016 --> 05:08.608
Good morning.

05:08.892 --> 05:09.643
Good morning.

05:09.935 --> 05:10.731
I missed you yesterday, Scott.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.020
I'm glad you're back.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.189
Who's been sucking
on your neck there?

05:14.481 --> 05:14.982
No one!

05:15.273 --> 05:15.944
An octopus.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.359
Oh yeah?

05:17.651 --> 05:19.494
We need to talk about that.

05:27.077 --> 05:27.703
All right.

05:27.994 --> 05:28.870
Let's go, let's go.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.005
Ladies, ladies,
ladies, let's go.

05:31.289 --> 05:33.587
for
first period, please.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.297
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

05:35.585 --> 05:38.008
You two, I'm going to have you
go work in Ms. Larson's room.

05:38.296 --> 05:39.798
Hi, this
is Ms. Ambrosius calling

05:40.090 --> 05:41.307
from Black Rock High School.

05:41.591 --> 05:44.310
So what's your responsibility
as a 18-year-old?

05:44.594 --> 05:45.937
To get yourself up and--?

05:48.765 --> 05:49.357
Come to school.

05:49.641 --> 05:51.860
You missed Monday.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.396
And now today you're home again.

05:54.688 --> 05:58.192
So what's going on?

05:58.483 --> 06:01.862
If you're looking for a
place to hide, this isn't it.

06:02.153 --> 06:03.905
Because at a traditional
high school you can come in

06:04.197 --> 06:05.619
and you can sit in
the back of the room,

06:05.907 --> 06:09.161
slouch down, and let the other
people answer the questions.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.705
And the bell rings and you
get up and leave, right?

06:11.997 --> 06:13.544
At our school the teachers
are going to watch

06:13.832 --> 06:14.958
over your shoulders a lot.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.342
They're going to be,
"What are you doing?

06:16.626 --> 06:17.343
Why you doing that?

06:17.627 --> 06:18.674
Do you need help with that?"

06:18.962 --> 06:22.182
At our school, we
want you to demand--

06:22.465 --> 06:24.638
to demand that we help you.

06:24.926 --> 06:28.271
There is no shame
in asking for help.

06:28.555 --> 06:29.602
OK.

06:29.890 --> 06:30.561
All right, Joey.

06:30.849 --> 06:33.022
So I'm Ms. Viland.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.028
Let's start first
with how our school

06:35.312 --> 06:37.690
differs than a traditional
high school, OK?

06:37.981 --> 06:40.484
This is a self-paced program.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.527
That means you've got to
have a burn and a desire

06:42.819 --> 06:44.947
to get your butt up every
day and get on with it.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.285
OK?
- All right.

06:46.573 --> 06:47.790
It's got
to come from inside.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.327
At our school, you're only
stuck here as long as it

06:50.619 --> 06:52.337
takes you to do your work.

06:52.621 --> 06:55.170
So the day you finish that
last assignment is the day

06:55.457 --> 06:57.084
you can stop coming to school.

06:57.375 --> 07:01.471
So you showing up here shows
to me that you've realized

07:01.755 --> 07:04.474
you've got to get the diploma.

07:04.758 --> 07:05.259
Yeah.

07:05.550 --> 07:06.301
So how?

07:06.593 --> 07:08.015
How we gonna do this, Joey?

07:08.303 --> 07:09.225
I don't really know, honestly.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.731
I've never really
clone schoolwork.

07:12.015 --> 07:12.732
I know you haven't.

07:13.016 --> 07:13.562
I know.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.898
I know.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.245
Don't
let her sing her song.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.962
I was never a bad kid.

07:42.253 --> 07:44.631
I mean, junior high,
yeah, but I just

07:44.923 --> 07:47.392
had a lot going on in my life.

07:47.676 --> 07:51.226
My mom was on drugs, and
my stepdad was-- well,

07:51.513 --> 07:53.936
he was on drugs too.

07:54.224 --> 07:55.692
I wanted to be like him.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.729
I decided to break into houses
and steal stuff from everyone.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.614
That's how I chose to
survive at that time.

08:01.898 --> 08:02.945
Now I'm on probation.

08:03.233 --> 08:07.989
But I won't
hesitate no more.

08:08.279 --> 08:11.408
No more, no more.

08:11.700 --> 08:15.375
This cannot wait.

08:15.662 --> 08:16.379
I'm yours.

08:20.542 --> 08:25.013
This town kind of swallows
people up and brings them down.

08:25.296 --> 08:28.846
I don't want to end up like
everyone in Twentynine Palms.

08:29.134 --> 08:31.808
OK, after school
in the parking lot.

08:32.095 --> 08:33.312
But right now we're
talking about genetics.

08:33.596 --> 08:34.722
I did that before.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.688
See-- do you
see the three up there?

08:36.975 --> 08:38.352
NOW Joey?

08:38.643 --> 08:44.116
Which of these traits is the
recessive gene most common?

08:44.399 --> 08:45.321
The dominant gene
isn't most common.

08:45.608 --> 08:46.780
My gene is the most common.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.695
The recessive
is most common.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.455
Our gene is.

08:50.739 --> 08:52.992
Which means that the
dominant trait is the lowest.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.788
Hey Anthony, it's
Ms. Ambrosius.

08:58.079 --> 09:01.253
I'm calling because we have
people looking for you here.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.169
I'm looking for
you for attendance.

09:04.461 --> 09:05.553
Here's the thing.

09:05.837 --> 09:07.635
My philosophy is I have
no punishments here.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.299
You will not get a punishment.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.309
We have no lunch detentions,
no after-school detentions,

09:11.593 --> 09:12.936
no Saturday schools.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.187
Because that's not the way
it works in the real world.

09:15.472 --> 09:16.974
If I get in trouble with
my boss, she doesn't say,

09:17.265 --> 09:19.063
oh Ms. Viland, you
have Saturday school.

09:19.350 --> 09:20.772
Oh no, no, no.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.155
She comes in, she closes the
door, and she says, look woman,

09:23.438 --> 09:25.190
you better get your act
together and do it my way,

09:25.482 --> 09:26.654
or I'm going to fire you.

09:26.941 --> 09:30.491
And that's how I
handle discipline.

09:30.779 --> 09:32.372
He did quite well in English.

09:32.655 --> 09:35.875
3.4 credits in one credit
check is pretty good.

09:36.159 --> 09:38.082
But then when I
look here, he hasn't

09:38.369 --> 09:40.588
gotten any science done at all.

09:40.872 --> 09:43.671
OK, you keep saying
that you are adult

09:43.958 --> 09:45.926
enough and responsible enough.

09:46.211 --> 09:49.260
OK, you need to stop saying
it and start showing it.

09:49.547 --> 09:50.423
Yes?
- Yeah.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.183
OK.

09:52.467 --> 09:56.017
You realize you're 8.7
credits above being a freshman.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.180
Yeah.

09:57.472 --> 09:58.189
And next year's
your senior year.

09:58.473 --> 09:59.599
Yeah.

09:59.891 --> 10:01.768
If I make a credit every
day starting next year,

10:02.060 --> 10:03.482
I'll graduate two months early.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.647
How about a credit
every day starting next week?

10:05.939 --> 10:06.735
Well, I'll be
trying to do that.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.149
No, not try.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.784
Try tells me that you're
not going to do it.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.490
You and
I talk a lot about this.

10:11.778 --> 10:12.370
You're angry.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.076
Mm-hmm.

10:14.364 --> 10:16.662
And used to be when you were
angry you would hit somebody.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.293
- That was the first step, right?
- Yeah

10:18.576 --> 10:20.169
OK, and I said, OK, we're
going to make a little step

10:20.453 --> 10:21.670
and we're going
to hit walls now.

10:21.955 --> 10:22.501
Right?

10:22.789 --> 10:23.756
And We hit walls.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.509
And now, this morning
you got angry.

10:26.793 --> 10:27.464
Did you hit anything?
- No.

10:27.752 --> 10:28.298
You didn't hit anything.

10:28.586 --> 10:29.178
I just walked away.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.213
You walked away.

10:30.505 --> 10:31.927
A little bit further at a time.

10:35.051 --> 10:37.349
Lee, you and I
have a deal, right?

10:37.637 --> 10:38.604
Yes.

10:38.888 --> 10:39.980
We're
going to help you,

10:40.265 --> 10:41.357
but you're going to
have to help yourself.

10:41.641 --> 10:42.437
You're going to have
to be using your time.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.102
You need to be here every day.

10:44.394 --> 10:47.022
You need to get
everything done, right?

10:47.313 --> 10:48.815
So this looks like a good plan.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.618
And then you need to get another
four credits in electives,

10:56.906 --> 10:58.453
in any of these ones here.

10:58.741 --> 11:02.416
Either in careers or fitness.

11:02.704 --> 11:04.923
So is this doable?

11:05.206 --> 11:06.924
I think it is.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.255
I think it is too.

11:08.543 --> 11:11.888
You now have a huge
responsibility.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.174
Because if you don't graduate,
your baby won't graduate.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.902
You might be going
through some hard times.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.028
You might, I might.

11:27.312 --> 11:28.780
Any of us can.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.030
But that don't mean we should
just tear down because of it.

11:30.315 --> 11:31.066
I'm not giving up.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.483
I'm still trying to graduate.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.493
I'm going to graduate.

11:34.777 --> 11:35.699
I'm not going to
drop out of school.

11:35.987 --> 11:36.738
I'm going to graduate.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.282
The mother's going to graduate.

11:38.573 --> 11:40.621
We're going to start better
off in life, because we

11:40.909 --> 11:42.035
didn't give up on our child.

11:54.631 --> 11:57.885
Chop, chop, chop, chop,
I'm picking up the speed.

12:00.595 --> 12:01.346
Have a good day, kids.

12:01.638 --> 12:03.811
See you all tomorrow.

12:04.098 --> 12:04.690
All right.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.317
Bus is here, time to go!

12:34.254 --> 12:37.133
Everyone has a
kid in them still.

12:37.423 --> 12:40.267
I don't want the little
kid in me to die.

12:40.551 --> 12:45.307
I feel, like, stuck in between
a man and a child still trying

12:45.598 --> 12:48.351
to build his way to
becoming a good man,

12:48.643 --> 12:51.192
a man my son can be like, oh,
I'm proud of daddy, he did it.

12:51.479 --> 12:52.480
I want to be like that.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.823
I'm not just going to be
some deadbeat who drops out

12:58.111 --> 13:00.364
and never go anywhere in life.

13:00.655 --> 13:02.657
I stay dedicated
to my girlfriend,

13:02.949 --> 13:06.169
my work, and my child,
trying to graduate school.

13:06.452 --> 13:09.080
That's what makes me
different as a teen father.

13:09.372 --> 13:11.215
I'm not going around causing
trouble, trying to party.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.877
I don't do that either.

13:14.168 --> 13:17.422
I'm always with him.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.933
Taking care of him.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.934
What was your first
reaction when you found out you

13:22.218 --> 13:24.687
was pregnant and having a baby?

13:24.971 --> 13:25.563
I don't know.

13:25.847 --> 13:27.440
I was scared.

13:27.724 --> 13:30.819
I don't know, I didn't
know what to do.

13:31.102 --> 13:32.274
Or anything.

13:32.562 --> 13:35.941
My first reaction
was, eh, it was going

13:36.232 --> 13:37.199
to happen sooner or later.

13:37.483 --> 13:40.157
So you know, let's
see where it goes.

13:40.445 --> 13:41.537
That was actually
my first reaction.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.698
I wasn't scared,
I wasn't nervous.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.742
I was like, I'm gonna
face it head on.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.286
I'm not gonna run from it.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.429
OK, earth science?

14:06.721 --> 14:08.815
Have you done any of these?

14:09.098 --> 14:10.896
I have one done.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.231
And I'm working on
another one now.

14:12.518 --> 14:13.940
OK.

14:14.228 --> 14:16.606
So if you've got the one here,
have you done an essay yet?

14:16.898 --> 14:18.150
Mm-mm.

14:18.441 --> 14:19.738
Why not?

14:20.026 --> 14:22.825
I haven't done any English
since I've been here.

14:23.112 --> 14:27.538
OK, you know, Joey,
you need almost 3O credits

14:27.825 --> 14:28.667
in English.

14:28.951 --> 14:31.579
That's three years.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.214
You need to be
doing these essays

14:33.498 --> 14:36.001
every credit check if you're
serious about graduating.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.839
That sucks.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.470
Joey.

14:39.754 --> 14:42.052
You have the ability.

14:42.340 --> 14:44.513
This is totally doable, OK?

14:44.801 --> 14:46.348
Yeah.

14:46.636 --> 14:47.307
Are you hearing me?

14:47.595 --> 14:48.312
Mm-hmm.

14:48.596 --> 14:49.347
Not just listening.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.733
You're hearing what I'm saying.

14:52.016 --> 14:52.517
Yeah.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.740
I am sitting
with Joey McGee right now.

15:03.027 --> 15:04.745
He is confused.

15:05.029 --> 15:09.125
Is he still on probation
or off probation?

15:09.409 --> 15:10.035
OK thanks.

15:10.326 --> 15:10.872
Bye-bye.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.290
I believe you're off probation.

15:18.292 --> 15:21.637
Now, that doesn't mean you can
do whatever the hell you want.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.173
I haven't
been doing anything.

15:23.464 --> 15:24.431
Still staying out of trouble.

15:24.715 --> 15:25.807
OK.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.184
I don't want you to
stop coming to school.

15:27.468 --> 15:30.267
Because, you know,
I just don't want

15:30.555 --> 15:34.025
you to sell yourself short.

15:34.308 --> 15:36.686
Hopefully I can get
out of this stuff, but just--

15:36.978 --> 15:39.857
All right, Joey, most things
that you do here probably

15:40.148 --> 15:41.695
won't apply to your life.

15:41.983 --> 15:44.611
It's all playing a game.

15:44.902 --> 15:47.826
And I know because you're gifted
musically you don't yet realize

15:48.114 --> 15:49.832
the importance of the diploma.

15:50.116 --> 15:55.498
But I'm telling you, there are
more homeless talented people

15:55.788 --> 15:57.790
out there because
they didn't fit

15:58.082 --> 16:01.461
into the societal expectations.

16:01.752 --> 16:03.550
You know what I mean?

16:14.390 --> 16:15.607
Would you like to play it?

16:15.892 --> 16:16.563
Huh?

16:16.851 --> 16:17.602
Would you like to play it?

16:17.894 --> 16:18.861
I want to play with you, man.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.318
I need a rhythm so bad.

16:21.606 --> 16:22.198
I'm not good.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.200
I'm still practicing.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.361
No such thing as
"I'm not good."

16:26.652 --> 16:28.654
I used to be like that.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.289
I've been playing for
seven years though.

16:30.573 --> 16:32.701
I've got that kind of
bluesy sound to me, though.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.335
There's a lot of
pain in my music.

16:34.619 --> 16:35.120
For whatever reason.

16:35.411 --> 16:37.379
I don't know why.

16:37.663 --> 16:38.880
What are
you starting off with?

16:39.165 --> 16:39.882
What's the chord?

16:40.166 --> 16:40.883
What is it called?

16:48.466 --> 16:49.809
I have one friend.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.218
But it's good that way.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.888
Because when I had a lot
of friends I did bad.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.932
And I was doing bad things.

16:56.224 --> 16:57.726
I did a lot of drugs.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.315
And I had to take care of
my baby brother and stuff,

17:00.603 --> 17:01.570
because my mom was never home.

17:04.815 --> 17:06.532
If
I get my high school diploma

17:06.817 --> 17:08.319
I can turn my life
around for the better.

17:08.611 --> 17:10.989
I mean, I really do want
to get out of that trailer.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.031
And I don't want to
keep using food stamps.

17:13.324 --> 17:14.826
I don't like using
that as a crutch.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.993
I'm just using it
because no one can

17:17.286 --> 17:19.003
really afford food in my house.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.671
I remember sometime

17:22.959 --> 17:24.336
in the fourth grade,
one of my teachers

17:24.627 --> 17:26.425
told me I would never
amount to anything.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.089
So I kind of just, like,
stuck with that, that I

17:28.381 --> 17:29.724
would never amount to anything.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.851
So I thought everything I
did was just for no reason.

17:33.135 --> 17:35.058
- I
- get really bad stressing out,

17:35.346 --> 17:38.475
to the point where,
like, I do not

17:38.766 --> 17:41.815
talk to anybody or
anything, or I just,

17:42.103 --> 17:45.573
like, try to block
out everybody.

17:45.856 --> 17:47.654
Anger
builds up in me because my dad,

17:47.942 --> 17:50.411
like, he yell at
me a lot of times.

17:50.695 --> 17:53.118
He want me to be a
better person than he is.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.783
He just bring me
down, and I don't feel

17:55.074 --> 17:57.918
like living sometimes no more.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.203
Oh my god.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.668
I am 17 and pregnant.

18:01.956 --> 18:04.675
What am I going to-- I'm
not even out of high school.

18:04.959 --> 18:05.755
I don't

18:06.043 --> 18:07.260
want to be trapped anywhere.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.388
Don't want to ever be
trapped in anything.

18:09.672 --> 18:11.174
I see a lot of people who
are trapped in this town.

18:11.465 --> 18:12.387
My mom is--

18:12.675 --> 18:13.767
I still don't know her address.

18:14.051 --> 18:15.018
I still don't know
where she's at.

18:15.303 --> 18:16.020
Don't care

18:16.304 --> 18:17.226
about what other people say.

18:17.513 --> 18:18.730
Everybody

18:19.015 --> 18:20.107
knows me to be a happy
guy, smiling all the time.

18:20.391 --> 18:21.813
But I do feel sad.

18:22.101 --> 18:22.977
My mom,

18:23.269 --> 18:24.737
she didn't finish high school.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.318
My
mom, I don't know where she is.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.153
I'm a stubborn kid.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.660
First and foremost, that's
basically why I'm here.

18:30.943 --> 18:31.694
I didn't want to do my work.

18:33.654 --> 18:34.780
She's my only little sister.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.790
My older sisters that I
looked up to were like--

18:46.375 --> 18:47.592
OK guys, time
for second period, please.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.513
My whole
seventh, eighth, ninth grade

18:55.801 --> 18:58.975
year, I really don't even
remember school those years.

18:59.263 --> 19:00.765
Like they really didn't exist.

19:09.148 --> 19:12.027
When I was younger,
my mom just like left.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.365
I don't know where she went.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.998
I just started living
with my grandma.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.750
My dad, my real dad's just
been in and out of my life.

19:20.034 --> 19:21.502
He's never really
been there for me.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.552
And then when I was
in grade school,

19:29.835 --> 19:33.681
my grandma's
husband molested me.

19:33.964 --> 19:35.716
I was probably the most
depressed teenager.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.431
I just don't think teenagers are
supposed to be that depressed.

19:43.474 --> 19:46.068
We can't control the
events that happen to us,

19:46.352 --> 19:48.104
but we can choose not
to be reduced by them.

19:51.816 --> 19:54.194
I'm just going to be
strong, not somebody

19:54.485 --> 19:56.203
that's going to let what
happened to them break them.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.414
You said there
was drama the other night.

20:03.703 --> 20:04.374
Yeah.

20:04.662 --> 20:05.914
What happened?

20:06.205 --> 20:07.127
It was like, I
wouldn't feel as responsible

20:07.415 --> 20:09.008
if he would just
stop popping up,

20:09.291 --> 20:11.919
like not still doing stuff
to still hurt my grandma.

20:12.211 --> 20:15.260
Like I feel like it's my
fault a lot of the time.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.721
OK, but Jennifer,
we've talked about this before.

20:18.008 --> 20:19.885
Do you want your grandma with
somebody who, first of all,

20:20.177 --> 20:22.145
does things like that
to you, but secondly,

20:22.430 --> 20:24.273
who treats her that Way?

20:24.557 --> 20:25.979
If I would have
just dealt with what

20:26.267 --> 20:30.238
he was doing to me and never
told my grandma, he wouldn't--

20:30.521 --> 20:31.613
Honey.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.023
Like, I just feel like
it's my fault. Like,

20:33.315 --> 20:34.487
I could have just dealt
with it without having

20:34.775 --> 20:36.903
my grandma to deal with it.

20:37.194 --> 20:39.288
No.

20:39.572 --> 20:40.994
Honey.

20:41.282 --> 20:42.454
Let me ask you this.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.791
If I got one of the
counselors, but somebody,

20:46.078 --> 20:48.706
like a sexual
assault counselor--

20:48.998 --> 20:50.341
because it's common.

20:50.624 --> 20:53.218
It's common that the victims
feel that responsibility.

20:53.502 --> 20:55.300
And they shouldn't.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.717
It's not-- you can't-- it's
never the victim's fault.

20:59.008 --> 21:01.010
But I
blame myself a lot.

21:01.302 --> 21:02.428
I know you do.

21:02.720 --> 21:03.767
And that's what I worry
about, is that you take

21:04.054 --> 21:05.101
everything on your shoulders.

21:05.389 --> 21:07.141
And then it becomes
a roadblock from you

21:07.433 --> 21:09.686
from doing what you
need to do for you.

21:09.977 --> 21:10.648
You know what I mean?

21:10.936 --> 21:12.938
You were the victim.

21:13.230 --> 21:14.573
You're the child.

21:14.857 --> 21:16.359
You are not the adult.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.948
I feel like it.

21:19.236 --> 21:21.864
It's just-- I don't-- I want
to be more focused on school,

21:22.156 --> 21:23.829
and I feel like I'm
really, really trying.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.790
And I really, really want
to graduate this year.

21:27.077 --> 21:30.126
I just, I couldn't go
to school yesterday.

21:30.414 --> 21:32.712
Because I don't like people
here seeing me break down.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.092
I'm not--

21:34.376 --> 21:35.844
Honey, We
all break down here.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.971
That's what's great about it,
is that you can break down here.

21:38.255 --> 21:39.677
I know.

21:39.965 --> 21:42.013
I can break down to you here,
but not everybody else here.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.177
The kids all do.

21:43.469 --> 21:45.563
We see every-- I
mean, you see it.

21:45.846 --> 21:48.895
Everyone who goes
here has something.

21:49.183 --> 21:51.185
That's Why they go here.

21:51.477 --> 21:52.194
I know.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.005
We talked real
briefly at the last staff

22:15.292 --> 22:16.669
meeting about Adopt a
Student again, and just kind

22:16.961 --> 22:18.463
of refreshing your memory.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.677
If you can please make sure to
touch base with your students.

22:20.965 --> 22:23.059
And if we can just do
a go-around as to who

22:23.342 --> 22:24.434
you're working with again.

22:24.718 --> 22:25.765
Did We find out what's
going on with Jesse?

22:26.053 --> 22:26.929
Yes.

22:27.221 --> 22:28.347
He and his mom
have been evicted.

22:28.639 --> 22:29.640
So they're couching it.

22:29.932 --> 22:30.558
He's so smart.

22:30.850 --> 22:31.351
He is.

22:31.642 --> 22:33.064
He is.

22:33.352 --> 22:37.357
But that's Why-- the connection
of why we've seen the anger.

22:37.648 --> 22:39.275
Because lately it's been
if you even look at him

22:39.567 --> 22:41.319
cross-eyed he's been angry.

22:41.610 --> 22:44.329
But obviously, you
know, justly so.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.832
Maurice, he
said he wasn't here yesterday

22:47.116 --> 22:48.993
because he had nowhere
to stay Monday night

22:49.285 --> 22:50.332
and didn't have clean
clothes yesterday.

22:50.619 --> 22:52.041
Yeah,
he was kicked out.

22:52.329 --> 22:53.501
In fact, Jeanie texted me this
morning, "ls Maurice there?

22:53.789 --> 22:54.540
I'm worried."

22:54.832 --> 22:56.049
Because he was kicked out.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.051
But I asked him today, and
he said he got back in.

22:58.335 --> 23:00.588
Someone else told me that story
about not having clean clothes,

23:00.880 --> 23:02.302
and it wasn't him.

23:02.590 --> 23:03.807
OK, please just tell him to
bring a whole bag of clothes in

23:04.091 --> 23:05.058
and we'll Wash them for him.

23:05.342 --> 23:06.389
That's not a problem at all.

23:06.677 --> 23:07.303
Well,
and I told Maurice,

23:07.595 --> 23:08.517
you know, we'll feed you.

23:08.804 --> 23:09.851
Just get here.

23:10.139 --> 23:11.516
I just inherited Victor.

23:11.807 --> 23:13.935
He talked with Wanda and has
got a lot of stuff going on.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.478
He's got his story.

23:15.769 --> 23:18.318
He was in tears in my
office, and very embarrassed

23:18.606 --> 23:20.199
about breaking down in tears.

23:20.482 --> 23:23.110
His biggest worry is that
this is all he has for life,

23:23.402 --> 23:24.870
because this is
where he started.

23:25.154 --> 23:27.657
And he doesn't want
to end up on welfare.

23:27.948 --> 23:32.374
He doesn't want to live the
life that his family lives.

23:32.661 --> 23:34.789
And he's afraid he's going
to get sucked into it.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.457
And he said it's hard
for him some days

23:36.749 --> 23:39.218
just to get out of bed,
because he just can't face it.

25:00.290 --> 25:01.257
Good
morning, Miss Jan.

25:01.542 --> 25:02.714
Time to get UP!

25:03.002 --> 25:04.970
It's Ms. Viland.

25:05.254 --> 25:06.471
Jan, it's time to get up.

25:06.755 --> 25:09.929
I'm going to expect you
here at 7:30 this morning.

25:10.217 --> 25:10.718
See you in a bit.

25:11.010 --> 25:11.511
Love ya.

25:11.802 --> 25:12.769
Bye.

25:13.053 --> 25:13.895
Good morning, sweetie,
it's Ms. Viland.

25:14.179 --> 25:15.726
How are you this morning?

25:16.015 --> 25:16.516
Good.

25:16.807 --> 25:18.059
You sleep well?

25:18.350 --> 25:19.943
All right, it's time to get
in here and get to work.

25:23.856 --> 25:25.233
White milk, anyone?

25:25.524 --> 25:28.824
Anyone getting rid
of anything today?

25:29.111 --> 25:30.203
Do you want a white milk?

25:30.487 --> 25:31.033
Too many hungry people.

25:36.201 --> 25:38.078
So
if you could tell me

25:38.370 --> 25:41.465
one thing about yourself,
what would it be?

25:41.749 --> 25:46.971
What is one thing that you feel
like I need to know about you?

25:47.254 --> 25:48.096
I have a three-month-old son.

25:48.380 --> 25:48.881
Really?

25:49.173 --> 25:51.801
Oh, little baby!

25:52.092 --> 25:54.220
I can care less what
you think about me.

25:55.721 --> 25:56.973
That's good to know.

25:57.264 --> 26:00.859
Lucky for you I don't think
anything about anybody.

26:01.143 --> 26:03.066
I'm an emotional wreck.

26:03.353 --> 26:04.775
Who says?

26:05.064 --> 26:05.690
Me.

26:05.981 --> 26:06.482
Everybody.

26:09.860 --> 26:11.703
OK, so take this.

26:11.987 --> 26:14.115
This is a list of
different feelings.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.704
What are some feelings you have
felt in a dating relationship?

26:16.992 --> 26:18.084
Lee, write yours down.

26:18.368 --> 26:18.994
You're going to have
some good ones, I know.

26:23.207 --> 26:24.959
I don't know why I'm
circling every one of these,

26:25.250 --> 26:27.218
and it's horrible.

26:27.503 --> 26:29.676
Jennifer, what's
going on with your three boys?

26:29.963 --> 26:32.091
I'm only talking to,
like, one right now.

26:32.382 --> 26:36.182
But just past
relationships are horrible.

26:36.470 --> 26:37.096
Yeah.

26:37.387 --> 26:38.354
Lee.

26:38.639 --> 26:40.562
I say lonely
in a relationship.

26:40.849 --> 26:42.192
Lonely?

26:42.476 --> 26:43.944
When a person
don't understand you

26:44.228 --> 26:45.821
and they don't even
try to talk you at all,

26:46.105 --> 26:47.106
it makes you feel lonely.

26:47.397 --> 26:49.650
Like, why did we get
together if I knew

26:49.942 --> 26:51.068
it was going to be like that.

26:51.360 --> 26:52.202
Yeah.

26:52.486 --> 26:53.453
That's how it makes you feel.

26:53.737 --> 26:54.329
Yeah.

26:54.613 --> 26:55.614
Any others, you guys?

26:55.906 --> 26:57.408
Unworthy and victimized.

26:57.699 --> 26:58.791
In your relationships?

26:59.076 --> 26:59.668
OK.

26:59.952 --> 27:00.498
Afraid.

27:00.786 --> 27:01.753
Afraid.

27:02.037 --> 27:03.254
And why did you feel afraid?

27:03.539 --> 27:06.713
Because I would always
have to take care of them,

27:07.000 --> 27:08.297
like nonstop.

27:08.585 --> 27:12.135
I would have to make sure
he wouldn't have to, like,

27:12.422 --> 27:13.514
kill himself.

27:13.799 --> 27:16.393
Him doing too many drugs
or doing too many--

27:16.677 --> 27:18.145
too much drinking
and everything.

27:18.428 --> 27:20.931
Because I would be out having to
stick my finger down his throat

27:21.223 --> 27:22.941
and clean up his puke and stuff.

27:23.225 --> 27:25.853
But I'm happy for what
I've been through.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.398
Even though it's like really,
really, really bad stuff that I

27:28.689 --> 27:30.157
went through and
everything, it's

27:30.440 --> 27:33.785
just-- I'm a better person now,
and I'm stronger because of it.

27:34.069 --> 27:35.491
And it's like, I feel
like because we've

27:35.779 --> 27:38.908
gone through stuff so
young, like how I've watched

27:39.199 --> 27:42.453
my grandma be in this cycle, now
that we've gone through it so

27:42.744 --> 27:45.213
young we can just be like,
OK, this is what not to do,

27:45.497 --> 27:47.124
instead of being stuck
in it our whole lives

27:47.416 --> 27:48.918
and dealing it.

27:49.209 --> 27:51.337
That's the key, is
breaking that cycle, right?

27:51.628 --> 27:52.845
Like how many more
kids do we have

27:53.130 --> 27:58.182
to endanger and mess up
before somebody is going

27:58.468 --> 28:00.846
to break the cycle, right?

28:40.552 --> 28:41.519
Have a good day at work.

28:41.803 --> 28:42.395
Love you, mom.

28:42.679 --> 28:43.225
You too.

28:43.513 --> 28:44.890
Love you too.

28:45.182 --> 28:47.651
Want to say,
bye grandma, love you grandma,

28:47.935 --> 28:48.811
have a good day at work!

28:54.066 --> 28:55.033
Look at Midnight.

28:55.317 --> 28:55.863
What you doing, Midnight?

29:03.659 --> 29:05.127
See, I've got to
do three chapters

29:05.410 --> 29:09.256
of life science, two essays,
history, I've got to do 2.2.

29:09.539 --> 29:11.507
Government I've got to do 2.5.

29:11.792 --> 29:13.715
And altogether he
takes more time

29:14.002 --> 29:16.676
than all of it put together.

29:16.964 --> 29:19.558
Where'd your mom go?

29:19.841 --> 29:20.387
Joy!

29:20.676 --> 29:21.222
Yeah?

29:21.510 --> 29:22.352
Where's Layla?

29:22.636 --> 29:23.137
Where's Layla?

29:23.428 --> 29:23.929
Yeah.

29:24.221 --> 29:24.972
I don't know.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.607
Man, tell her to hurry up.

30:17.607 --> 30:21.407
Four animals in
nature that scientists

30:21.695 --> 30:23.868
have made copies of.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.874
And one of them was the beaver.

30:59.066 --> 31:00.909
You could drop
out any time at school.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.866
My friend dropped
out, and he wasn't

31:03.153 --> 31:04.405
even a freshman in high school.

31:04.696 --> 31:05.697
He just dropped out.

31:05.989 --> 31:06.865
You can't drop out.

31:07.157 --> 31:07.999
I made 20 credits in one week.

31:08.283 --> 31:10.331
Why you gonna drop out, dude?

31:10.619 --> 31:11.962
I'm gonna just drop
out because making

31:12.245 --> 31:15.465
2O credits, just too much.

31:15.749 --> 31:17.046
But Layla's graduating.

31:17.334 --> 31:18.301
That's good for her.

31:28.637 --> 31:30.230
Give me a hug.

31:30.514 --> 31:33.768
I'm hearing that you're saying
that you think it's too hard.

31:34.059 --> 31:35.811
Close the door.

31:36.103 --> 31:36.774
It is.

31:37.062 --> 31:37.654
It's-—

31:37.938 --> 31:38.985
Tell me what's too hard.

31:39.272 --> 31:41.115
To get these 20
credits is hard.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.868
I would
guess that you're

31:43.151 --> 31:45.449
just kind of flipping through
and not really reading, right?

31:45.737 --> 31:47.205
I'm just not
getting the history.

31:47.489 --> 31:48.866
Any area-—

31:49.157 --> 31:50.909
OK, like I said, let’s just
put that to the back burner

31:51.201 --> 31:52.748
and work on something else.

31:53.036 --> 31:54.253
Me and Mike, he was
talking about this,

31:54.538 --> 31:55.960
we both are probably
talking about dropping out,

31:56.248 --> 31:58.046
like next-- this
year or something.

31:58.333 --> 31:59.505
No, you're
not dropping out.

31:59.793 --> 32:01.261
We're like, Wolfe
was like, it's hard.

32:01.545 --> 32:03.923
We might as well just drop out,
because we know we can't do it.

32:04.214 --> 32:05.306
And when it comes to
school I just don't

32:05.590 --> 32:06.762
believe I have what it takes.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.302
That's the silly talk.

32:08.593 --> 32:13.144
You know Lee, sometimes you
get into the silly mode.

32:13.432 --> 32:13.978
Yeah?

32:14.266 --> 32:15.108
I just--

32:15.392 --> 32:16.894
Dropping out is
just silly mode.

32:17.185 --> 32:19.028
You're going to need
benefits for the baby.

32:19.312 --> 32:20.404
You're going to need a job.

32:20.689 --> 32:21.906
That's what Layla's
going to do, right?

32:22.190 --> 32:24.033
She is graduating, so.

32:24.317 --> 32:25.239
No.

32:25.527 --> 32:28.497
Lee, who is in charge of this?

32:28.780 --> 32:29.747
Yeah, I'm in
charge of that.

32:30.031 --> 32:31.283
But how can others
believe in me when

32:31.575 --> 32:32.792
I don't even believe in myself?
- There we go.

32:33.076 --> 32:33.998
That's the key.

32:34.286 --> 32:34.957
I don't even believe
I can make it.

32:35.245 --> 32:36.963
You can do this.

32:37.247 --> 32:38.544
I don't think I can.

32:38.832 --> 32:41.711
If you choose-- if you choose
to do it, you can do it.

32:42.002 --> 32:42.969
We will help you.

33:34.846 --> 33:37.850
Joey I brought an electric!

33:38.141 --> 33:38.892
Want to play it?

33:39.184 --> 33:39.855
Yeah I want to play it.

33:40.143 --> 33:40.814
It's fun.

33:44.564 --> 33:45.235
Isn't it fun?

33:45.524 --> 33:47.197
Oh yeah.

34:08.088 --> 34:09.715
That was sick.

34:10.005 --> 34:10.598
That was really good.

34:10.882 --> 34:11.382
All right.

34:11.675 --> 34:12.891
Thank you.

34:13.176 --> 34:16.806
That thing is too sweet.

34:17.097 --> 34:22.945
You know a lot about math.

34:23.228 --> 34:24.775
I don't know, Mr. Bartz.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.781
Well, let's think about that.

34:29.985 --> 34:34.956
Do you know A440 megahertz?

34:35.239 --> 34:36.708
No.

34:36.992 --> 34:38.335
I've never even heard that in
my-- I don't know what that is.

34:38.618 --> 34:39.369
What is that?

34:39.661 --> 34:41.413
Don't you have a guitar tuner?

34:41.705 --> 34:42.547
Oh yeah.

34:42.831 --> 34:44.003
That's crazy!

34:44.291 --> 34:45.292
But it's all math.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.210
You're doing math
when you play music.

34:47.502 --> 34:50.847
What happens when you take
that A string and you come

34:51.130 --> 34:53.132
up to the double dots and play.

34:53.425 --> 34:54.426
It's the
same-- same sound.

34:54.717 --> 34:56.391
It's an A note
an octave higher.

34:56.678 --> 34:59.602
So what is that A string
at the double dots?

35:01.850 --> 35:04.148
So you've
been doing math.

35:04.436 --> 35:05.562
Oh crap.

35:05.854 --> 35:07.652
Well now here,
solving inequalities

35:07.939 --> 35:09.737
with variables on
both sides, if you

35:10.025 --> 35:12.198
subtract 10y from
both sides, you're

35:12.485 --> 35:13.577
going to have a negative.

35:13.862 --> 35:15.034
And you'll get to
where you don't even

35:15.322 --> 35:16.369
write minus 2a on each side.

35:16.656 --> 35:17.703
By the time you're
at college you'll

35:17.991 --> 35:19.117
just be bringing
it down, saying,

35:19.409 --> 35:21.161
I've got 2a left, minus 20.

35:21.453 --> 35:22.545
You'll do it more in your head.

35:22.829 --> 35:23.876
We're
reading Longfellow?

35:24.164 --> 35:25.290
Yep.

35:25.582 --> 35:27.334
OK, look at the second
stanza, the third line.

35:27.626 --> 35:30.300
"Dust thou art, to
dust returnest."

35:30.587 --> 35:31.839
What message did you get?

35:32.130 --> 35:33.006
Yes, Jennifer.

35:33.298 --> 35:35.300
Like, not to--
like that says not

35:35.592 --> 35:38.095
to be like dumb driven cattle.

35:38.386 --> 35:41.390
Don't just like go along
with whatever people say.

35:41.681 --> 35:42.933
Make your life more you.

35:43.224 --> 35:43.725
Excellent.

35:44.017 --> 35:44.518
Anyone else?

35:47.729 --> 35:48.525
Lee.

35:48.813 --> 35:49.484
How's that coming?

35:53.443 --> 35:54.695
My eyes hurt.

35:54.986 --> 35:55.612
Where's Hobbes at?

35:55.904 --> 35:57.451
I need to find Hobbes.

35:57.739 --> 35:59.082
Hobbes.

35:59.366 --> 36:03.416
That's the guy who thinks
poorly about the human race.

36:03.703 --> 36:04.625
OK.

36:04.913 --> 36:06.711
I got him and Locke
mixed up then.

36:06.998 --> 36:07.840
John Locke is the opposite.

36:08.124 --> 36:09.341
He's the good guy.

36:09.626 --> 36:11.094
Believes everybody should
have their own rights.

36:11.378 --> 36:12.880
It sounds like
he should be more of a bad one,

36:13.171 --> 36:14.013
because of his last name, Locke.

36:14.297 --> 36:15.423
Yeah.

36:15.715 --> 36:16.511
Vol-- Voltaire?
- Voltaire, yeah.

36:16.800 --> 36:17.801
He's my favorite.

36:18.093 --> 36:18.639
That is my favorite
philosopher ever.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.583
This
credit check we chose

36:41.866 --> 36:43.539
to recognize the
student who improved

36:43.827 --> 36:45.875
the most in each homeroom.

36:46.162 --> 36:49.041
From Ms. Alexander's
homeroom, Joey McGee!

36:54.379 --> 36:54.971
Nice!

36:55.255 --> 36:55.847
Congratulations.

36:56.131 --> 36:57.098
Keep up the good work.

37:01.636 --> 37:04.105
From Mr. Beck's
homeroom, Scott Johnson!

37:05.390 --> 37:07.063
Woo-hoo!

37:07.350 --> 37:08.522
Congratulations.

37:08.810 --> 37:09.527
Keep up that work.

37:21.531 --> 37:22.703
Where have you been?

37:22.991 --> 37:25.039
I didn't-- I
didn't have a ride.

37:25.326 --> 37:25.952
Oh my gosh.

37:26.244 --> 37:26.836
I swear!

37:27.120 --> 37:27.871
You're so full of it.

37:28.163 --> 37:29.039
You don't have a ride?

37:29.330 --> 37:31.128
There are people
that are homeless.

37:31.416 --> 37:33.669
There are people that
are pregnant that

37:33.960 --> 37:34.927
are able to get here.

37:35.211 --> 37:37.305
You look like a
well-bodied young man

37:37.589 --> 37:40.308
who would be able
to get to school

37:40.592 --> 37:42.185
if you had to, if that
was your priority.

37:45.430 --> 37:47.808
Why did you
flip the bus driver off?

37:48.099 --> 37:49.442
I didn't flip the
bus driver off.

37:49.726 --> 37:53.026
Well, let's go
back to why would

37:53.313 --> 37:54.610
you flip the bus driver off?

37:54.898 --> 37:55.899
I don't know.

37:56.191 --> 37:58.740
Because you don't
like the bus driver.

37:59.027 --> 38:01.906
So let's go back to,
am I right on why

38:02.197 --> 38:03.073
you flipped the bus driver off?

38:03.364 --> 38:04.411
Yeah.

38:04.699 --> 38:05.370
This is
what we were talking

38:05.658 --> 38:06.250
about yesterday out there.

38:06.534 --> 38:08.286
Where you heading, man?

38:08.578 --> 38:10.455
I'm not going to beat him up.

38:10.747 --> 38:11.794
Do I have
your word on that?

38:12.081 --> 38:13.003
You have my word.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.338
- As a man--
- As a man.

38:14.626 --> 38:15.297
Do I have
your word, you're

38:15.585 --> 38:16.336
not going to beat him up?

38:16.628 --> 38:17.345
I'm not going to beat him up.

38:17.629 --> 38:18.130
OK.

38:21.841 --> 38:22.637
McGee, or--?

38:22.926 --> 38:23.427
Yeah.

38:23.718 --> 38:25.345
Joey.

38:25.637 --> 38:27.059
Can I
get Joey McGee, please?

38:27.347 --> 38:28.098
- Sure.
- Thank you.

38:28.389 --> 38:28.935
He doesn't.

38:41.444 --> 38:42.161
Morning, Joey.

38:42.445 --> 38:43.287
Morning.

38:43.571 --> 38:44.868
Your choice, which
one do you want?

38:45.156 --> 38:48.581
You get a gift certificate
for such great attendance.

38:48.868 --> 38:50.415
What?

38:50.703 --> 38:52.421
Get a $5 gift certificate--

38:52.705 --> 38:53.297
Subway.

38:53.581 --> 38:54.127
--For good attendance.

38:54.415 --> 38:56.383
Subway sounds good.

38:56.668 --> 38:57.590
Oh, here.

38:57.877 --> 39:00.130
Good, but I need
you to sign this.

39:00.421 --> 39:01.388
Right here?

39:01.673 --> 39:02.139
Yeah, right there.

39:02.423 --> 39:02.969
OK.

39:07.554 --> 39:08.396
Everything OK?

39:08.680 --> 39:09.647
You're not in trouble, are you?

39:09.931 --> 39:11.808
Not that I understand.

39:12.100 --> 39:13.693
No, he's
doing really good, actually.

39:13.977 --> 39:15.149
I guess I'm
getting a gift card.

39:15.436 --> 39:16.653
Hey!

39:16.938 --> 39:17.905
For?

39:18.189 --> 39:19.190
- Good attendance.
- All right.

39:19.482 --> 39:20.199
That's what I like to hear.

39:20.483 --> 39:22.406
OK.

39:22.694 --> 39:23.786
There you go.
- Sweet.

39:24.070 --> 39:24.787
Congrats.

39:25.071 --> 39:25.572
Thank you.

39:28.449 --> 39:31.202
OK, so it showed that
you needed five credits

39:31.494 --> 39:33.292
at the beginning, when you first
came here, on your transcript,

39:33.580 --> 39:34.081
right?

39:34.372 --> 39:35.464
Mm-hmm.

39:35.748 --> 39:38.171
And the
other one is in econ.

39:38.459 --> 39:39.927
It shows none.

39:40.211 --> 39:41.463
Yeah, because I'm just waiting
for those credits to come in.

39:41.754 --> 39:43.222
OK.
All right.

39:43.506 --> 39:45.179
You're going to be out of here
before you know it, aren't you?

39:45.466 --> 39:46.888
Man, I'm trying to.

39:47.176 --> 39:50.020
So all I need is seven more
credits, and then I'm done.

39:50.305 --> 39:51.397
That makes me feel so happy.

39:51.681 --> 39:52.398
I am too, Michael.

39:52.682 --> 39:54.025
I'm very excited for you.

39:54.309 --> 39:55.401
Cool, thank you.

39:55.685 --> 39:57.187
I'm kind of sad.

39:57.478 --> 39:58.980
You don't want to
see me graduate?

39:59.272 --> 40:00.569
You do but you don't?

40:00.857 --> 40:01.949
That's fine.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.736
So all this is done.

40:05.028 --> 40:08.828
And econ-- you have four
chapters of econ left.

40:09.115 --> 40:10.742
That's it.

40:11.034 --> 40:12.035
That's amazing!

40:12.327 --> 40:14.204
Are you done?

40:14.495 --> 40:15.963
Black
Rock High School,

40:16.247 --> 40:19.046
if you would please join me in
congratulating graduate number

40:19.334 --> 40:21.553
29, Kayla Jeffries!

40:52.659 --> 40:55.412
Woo!

41:00.625 --> 41:01.421
All right!

41:01.709 --> 41:03.086
Yeah, another one!

41:03.378 --> 41:03.879
Woo!

41:04.170 --> 41:04.671
Yeah!

41:08.591 --> 41:11.561
All right, I am looking
for a number 30!

41:11.844 --> 41:13.517
That's what I'm looking for!

41:13.805 --> 41:16.979
I'm looking for a number 30!

41:17.266 --> 41:18.108
Ready?
On three.

41:18.393 --> 41:19.269
One, two, three.

41:19.560 --> 41:23.155
You look prettier than a flower.

41:27.485 --> 41:28.202
It's
one of my songs.

41:33.074 --> 41:35.577
I'll be back one of
these days, but for the moment

41:35.868 --> 41:36.915
I'm running away.

41:37.203 --> 41:38.455
I'm missing out on
too much that awaits.

41:38.746 --> 41:41.215
I'll be far away and
I'll live a life amazed.

41:41.499 --> 41:42.421
And life is a maze.

41:42.709 --> 41:44.131
Moving too fast,
man life is a race.

41:44.419 --> 41:47.047
Trying to keep up an impossible
pace, last place, getting

41:47.338 --> 41:48.339
lost in space.

41:48.631 --> 41:49.757
No place to go, and
no place to sleep.

41:50.049 --> 41:52.051
No cast to show and
no place to eat.

41:52.343 --> 41:53.640
School days that
were a waste to me.

41:53.928 --> 41:55.430
Living free is the place to be.

41:55.722 --> 41:57.770
Pocket lint in these faded
jeans with my backpack

41:58.057 --> 41:59.434
on, just chasing dreams.

41:59.726 --> 42:01.399
With a broken heart that's
provoking art, art that's not

42:01.686 --> 42:02.778
judged by A's and B's.

42:03.062 --> 42:04.564
Streets are cracked
and the road is long.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.449
The world's on my
back, just loaded on.

42:06.733 --> 42:08.827
I'm on the edge, just
holding on till I slip away,

42:09.110 --> 42:12.080
then I'm floating on. 'Cause
I'm lost, but I'm not that lost.

42:12.363 --> 42:13.831
I'm scared, but I'm
not that scared.

42:14.115 --> 42:16.288
I care, but I just
don't care right now,

42:16.576 --> 42:18.624
anywhere is better than here.

42:20.288 --> 42:22.006
Thanks.

42:22.290 --> 42:22.961
You rock.

42:23.249 --> 42:23.750
Thank you.

42:45.813 --> 42:49.192
Just a reminder
that We are officially halfway

42:49.484 --> 42:50.610
through the credit check.

42:50.902 --> 42:51.573
Yikes.

42:51.861 --> 42:52.487
Ooh.

42:52.779 --> 42:54.656
Yes, yikes, exactly.

42:54.947 --> 42:58.201
That means in three weeks
we're halfway through the year.

42:58.493 --> 43:00.916
That means it is so important
that you are looking

43:01.204 --> 43:04.378
at your plan folders, that you
are looking at what work you

43:04.665 --> 43:06.588
need to get done, what
your credit goals are,

43:06.876 --> 43:08.924
and then you're
in line for that.

43:09.212 --> 43:12.716
We're going
to take our compass,

43:13.007 --> 43:17.353
find a point anywhere on it, OK
probably kind of a larger arch,

43:17.637 --> 43:21.892
the longest we can probably
get, so maybe out in here, OK?

43:22.183 --> 43:24.106
Joey.

43:24.393 --> 43:26.646
Joey?

43:26.938 --> 43:28.986
Rise and shine.

43:29.273 --> 43:30.024
Let's have some sparkle.

43:34.112 --> 43:35.113
Joey!

43:35.404 --> 43:36.405
Joey.

43:36.697 --> 43:37.789
Yes, I heard you.

43:38.074 --> 43:39.166
OK, you're not going
to sleep here like that.

43:39.450 --> 43:40.918
You want to go to the
office and lay down?

43:41.202 --> 43:42.328
I already went
there last period.

43:42.620 --> 43:43.837
Well, you're going again.

43:44.122 --> 43:45.169
Why?

43:45.456 --> 43:46.127
Because you can't be
in here doing that.

43:52.046 --> 43:54.140
OK?

43:54.423 --> 43:56.050
Stupid.

43:56.342 --> 44:00.063
If you're not well then you
can go lay down somewhere else.

44:00.346 --> 44:01.689
Fucking tired.

44:01.973 --> 44:02.439
But you can't-- you
don't get to sleep in class.

44:02.723 --> 44:03.144
Shut up.

44:11.274 --> 44:12.617
How did he sneak in here?

44:12.900 --> 44:14.948
Why are We in here?

44:15.236 --> 44:17.330
Hey you, why are you in here?

44:21.117 --> 44:22.494
You're supposed to be in
Ms. White's, remember?

44:22.785 --> 44:23.411
We had a deal.

44:23.703 --> 44:24.204
I don't know.

44:24.495 --> 44:25.212
I don't remember.

44:25.496 --> 44:26.167
Tired.

44:26.455 --> 44:27.456
How come you're so tired?

44:27.748 --> 44:30.672
We took care of
a baby last night.

44:30.960 --> 44:32.587
Your ex--

44:32.879 --> 44:34.131
- Had a baby--
- Had a baby.

44:34.422 --> 44:35.548
--With one of my other
friends and got with another

44:35.840 --> 44:36.841
one of my other friends.

44:37.133 --> 44:38.806
And then he went to
jail, so he wanted

44:39.093 --> 44:40.720
me to take care of the kid.

44:41.012 --> 44:42.685
Yeah, but Joey, before you
can take care of somebody else,

44:42.972 --> 44:43.894
you've got to take
care of yourself.

44:44.182 --> 44:44.683
I know.

44:44.974 --> 44:45.520
I'm OK.

44:45.808 --> 44:46.354
Yeah?

44:46.642 --> 44:48.269
OK.

45:04.202 --> 45:06.921
I think Lee knows
enough of us and trusts

45:07.205 --> 45:10.129
enough of us, several
years even, that I

45:10.416 --> 45:12.043
don't think he'll leave us.

45:12.335 --> 45:12.836
I don't either.

45:13.127 --> 45:13.969
But he's--

45:14.253 --> 45:15.175
He feels like it right now.

45:15.463 --> 45:16.464
Because Lee was in
my sixth period.

45:16.756 --> 45:18.133
I think it's because
Layla is so close.

45:18.424 --> 45:19.016
Yes.

45:19.300 --> 45:20.677
And that's the reason.

45:20.968 --> 45:23.266
And I know right now he's
upset because all his friends

45:23.554 --> 45:26.808
and kids that are in
his class and everything

45:27.099 --> 45:28.316
are going to graduate.

45:28.601 --> 45:30.319
Which is Why
today he got into a thing,

45:30.603 --> 45:31.729
"I hate graduations.

45:32.021 --> 45:33.113
They want me to come out
and applaud for somebody

45:33.397 --> 45:34.614
that I don't care about."

45:34.899 --> 45:36.492
It's because they're all
his friends and he's not.

45:36.776 --> 45:38.323
Really, I mean I do
think it's hard for him.

45:38.611 --> 45:41.285
Because he's only got 'I00
credits and everybody's, you

45:41.572 --> 45:44.576
know, graduating.

45:44.867 --> 45:46.414
This many students
earned over 20

45:46.702 --> 45:48.375
credits these past six weeks.

45:48.663 --> 45:49.960
It's fabulous.

45:50.248 --> 45:53.548
I am just astounded by the
work ethic of all of you.

45:53.834 --> 45:56.713
When I tallied these
up, my first thought

45:57.004 --> 45:59.883
was of empathy for the teachers
and how much grading this

46:00.174 --> 46:02.051
means that they've done.

46:02.343 --> 46:08.942
Earning 28.5 credits,
Layla Schneider!

46:15.231 --> 46:15.948
That is amazing.

46:16.232 --> 46:19.452
I'm so proud of you.

46:19.735 --> 46:20.406
Congratulations.

46:20.695 --> 46:21.912
Keep up the good work.

46:24.740 --> 46:26.162
What's your problem?

46:26.450 --> 46:29.044
And now we're
going to make a bit of a leap.

46:29.328 --> 46:35.006
Earning 31.5 credits,
Miguel Alvarado!

47:26.552 --> 47:29.977
Do you want to talk about
what was going on at the house?

47:30.264 --> 47:31.686
Was anything-- was this
a particularly bad week

47:31.974 --> 47:33.021
at the house?

47:33.309 --> 47:34.105
No, we were just--
everyone was just hung

47:34.393 --> 47:36.111
over and partying at my house.

47:36.395 --> 47:37.772
ls there
a reason for that?

47:38.064 --> 47:39.941
Is it the beginning of the
month and there's more money?

47:40.232 --> 47:43.532
No, it's just-- we go through
phases where our house is

47:43.819 --> 47:46.368
crazy, and then we'll go through
Weeks where it's pretty boring,

47:46.655 --> 47:50.410
and then-- Last night there
was people-- I-- probably as I

47:50.701 --> 47:54.547
woke up-- I'm up until <i>3</i>
o'clock in the morning.

47:54.830 --> 47:58.380
I thought you and
I had talked about the fact

47:58.667 --> 48:00.169
that you weren't using anymore.

48:00.461 --> 48:01.587
I wasn't.

48:01.879 --> 48:02.926
So are you
drinking, then, instead?

48:03.214 --> 48:04.511
I drink occasionally.

48:04.799 --> 48:07.473
You see with that kind of
lifestyle creates, right?

48:07.760 --> 48:08.852
Oh, god.

48:09.136 --> 48:10.729
Nobody's responsible.

48:11.013 --> 48:13.311
What if we put you in
two science classes?

48:13.599 --> 48:15.522
You need to start getting
that feeling of success

48:15.810 --> 48:17.312
again that you had when
you first came here.

48:17.603 --> 48:20.607
Once you start seeing
the credit slips come in

48:20.898 --> 48:23.401
and you start feeling
that level of success,

48:23.692 --> 48:25.615
then you're going to
get back on track.

48:30.241 --> 48:34.371
Joey, I can't fix the home life.

48:34.662 --> 48:35.379
I can't fix that.

49:21.709 --> 49:22.676
Get
out of my house!

49:22.960 --> 49:23.552
Fuck you!

49:23.836 --> 49:25.679
Get out!

49:28.924 --> 49:31.143
Not really sure.

49:57.286 --> 49:58.583
Um, I'm
missing some students

49:58.871 --> 50:01.294
that I care about that I'm
trying to get a hold of.

50:01.582 --> 50:04.301
So does anyone have any way
of contacting Joey McGee?

50:08.005 --> 50:10.849
What about Lee Bridges?

50:11.133 --> 50:12.180
You don't know?

50:12.468 --> 50:13.344
You haven't seen him
around or anything?

50:13.636 --> 50:14.683
He's
in Twentynine.

50:14.970 --> 50:15.516
He's living
in Twentynine now?

50:15.804 --> 50:16.350
Yeah.

50:16.639 --> 50:17.310
Lee, where are you?

50:17.598 --> 50:19.600
Why are you still at home?

50:19.892 --> 50:20.859
Do you need me to come get you?

50:42.456 --> 50:44.254
What happened with
you and your momma?

50:44.542 --> 50:48.263
She-- basically her husband
talked her into saying that--

50:48.546 --> 50:50.264
kicking me out next
month or so, he says.

50:50.548 --> 50:51.891
Because you
don't have a diploma?

50:52.174 --> 50:54.723
Because I have a baby
and I don't have a diploma.

50:55.010 --> 50:57.104
So they say they're
kicking me out anyways.

50:57.388 --> 51:00.232
If my mom want to be like that
over a dude, then I don't care.

51:00.516 --> 51:02.189
When I leave, I don't even
want her a part of my life

51:02.476 --> 51:03.477
if that's really how
it's going to be.

51:10.442 --> 51:12.444
I'm about five minutes
from blowing my brains out

51:12.736 --> 51:13.703
if I just keep trying-

51:13.988 --> 51:15.205
I'm done trying.

51:15.489 --> 51:17.457
Just gonna go with it.

51:17.741 --> 51:19.493
Everyone thinks I suck
at everything I do,

51:19.785 --> 51:22.208
because I never commit to it.

51:22.496 --> 51:23.873
I don't care.

51:24.164 --> 51:25.666
I hate to sound like
a punk-ass teenager,

51:25.958 --> 51:27.255
but I just don't care anymore.

51:27.543 --> 51:28.965
I don't want to live
my life by a plan.

51:29.253 --> 51:32.097
I don't want to live in between
lines that tell you have

51:32.381 --> 51:33.223
to do these certain things.

51:33.507 --> 51:34.884
Fuck that.

51:35.175 --> 51:36.677
I'm tired of everyone telling
me I need to do something.

51:36.969 --> 51:38.642
Nobody's
ever even told you you need

51:38.929 --> 51:39.521
to do this, this, and this.

51:39.805 --> 51:40.931
Yes they do!

51:41.223 --> 51:42.896
Everyone does!

51:43.183 --> 51:45.311
Fucking go to school, get
your high school diploma,

51:45.603 --> 51:46.104
go to-- no.

51:46.395 --> 51:47.942
Fuck that.

51:48.230 --> 51:49.072
I'm all out of options.

51:49.356 --> 51:50.733
I have no idea.

51:51.025 --> 51:52.117
He doesn't have a TV.

51:52.401 --> 51:53.744
I took his guitar.

51:54.028 --> 51:56.406
I dumped five gallons
of water on him.

51:56.697 --> 52:01.373
You know, I'm not making it
comfortable at home for him.

52:01.660 --> 52:02.877
We quit doing dishes.

52:03.162 --> 52:05.039
There's no clean
dishes in this house.

52:05.331 --> 52:08.631
Look at where I am, and look at
how hard I struggle right now.

52:25.934 --> 52:28.562
I really, really want
to graduate a year early.

52:28.854 --> 52:30.276
I know.

52:30.564 --> 52:32.942
So we're just going to focus
on this one day at a time, OK?

52:33.233 --> 52:36.453
You can do it, Jennifer.

52:36.737 --> 52:38.614
Your portfolio's
almost done, right?

52:38.906 --> 52:41.079
This workbook's done.

52:41.367 --> 52:42.118
That's already done.

52:42.409 --> 52:44.411
be done tomorrow.

52:44.703 --> 52:46.421
OK?

52:46.705 --> 52:49.584
Pick one thing to work
on, on A Plus, at a time,

52:49.875 --> 52:53.129
and it's going to just--
we're going to do it.

52:53.420 --> 52:54.512
I'm so--

52:54.797 --> 52:55.343
I know.

52:55.631 --> 52:57.008
We're going to do it.

52:57.299 --> 52:58.050
And I keep rubbing my eyebrows
and I just got them done,

52:58.342 --> 52:59.093
so it burns.

53:03.514 --> 53:04.265
It's OK.

53:04.556 --> 53:05.808
You can do it, OK?

53:06.100 --> 53:08.603
Look at-- look at how
fast it went away.

53:08.894 --> 53:13.149
My dad was being mean to me
last night, and it made me sad.

53:13.440 --> 53:13.941
Who?

53:14.233 --> 53:15.780
My dad.

53:16.068 --> 53:17.365
Don't worry about him.

53:17.653 --> 53:20.497
He'll-- you'll
graduate, you'll walk.

53:20.781 --> 53:21.873
And you know what?

53:22.157 --> 53:23.124
If you don't, you're
still going to graduate.

53:23.409 --> 53:24.410
And that's what's
most important.

53:24.702 --> 53:25.954
I invited him to my
graduation, and he

53:26.245 --> 53:28.748
like yelled at me for
graduating early, and like--

53:29.039 --> 53:30.336
Oh my
goodness, Jennifer.

53:30.624 --> 53:31.466
He's just mean.

53:31.750 --> 53:33.718
So you know what?

53:34.002 --> 53:35.879
You're going to
go to college, and

53:36.171 --> 53:37.263
you're going to make
something, and then

53:37.548 --> 53:40.722
you can nyah in his face.

53:41.009 --> 53:41.976
Right?

53:42.261 --> 53:43.558
Mad because you're
graduating early?

53:43.846 --> 53:44.893
What parent does that?

53:47.933 --> 53:49.025
We'll show him.

53:49.309 --> 53:52.233
He can come to your
college graduation

53:52.521 --> 53:54.194
and be mad because
you graduated college.

53:54.481 --> 53:56.904
Darn you.

53:57.192 --> 53:58.990
Stinking kid, doing
good with your life.

53:59.278 --> 54:00.495
We're over that.

54:04.158 --> 54:05.455
That's all you're focusing on.

54:05.743 --> 54:07.962
When you finish those,
you come see me.

54:08.245 --> 54:10.589
OK.

54:10.873 --> 54:12.216
Let me ask you this.

54:12.499 --> 54:14.797
Are you doing it for him or
are you doing it for you?

54:15.085 --> 54:15.802
I'm doing it for me.

54:16.086 --> 54:17.303
OK.

54:17.588 --> 54:18.885
I know it's hard, because
you want his approval.

54:19.173 --> 54:19.765
I get that.

54:20.048 --> 54:21.174
I understand that.

54:21.467 --> 54:26.018
But ultimately, you've
got to do stuff for you.

54:26.305 --> 54:28.399
You know what, when my dad died
I was cleaning out his house.

54:28.682 --> 54:29.899
And he was a hoarder.

54:30.184 --> 54:32.357
I found a letter in there
that was to his lawyer

54:32.644 --> 54:35.193
when my mom and dad divorced,
saying that he wanted

54:35.481 --> 54:36.607
my brother but he
didn't want me,

54:36.899 --> 54:38.993
and there's no way in
hell he would take me.

54:39.276 --> 54:40.448
OK?

54:40.736 --> 54:43.410
And I sat and I just
cried and cried and cried.

54:43.697 --> 54:45.244
All my life I
wanted his approval.

54:45.532 --> 54:46.408
I wanted his acceptance.

54:46.700 --> 54:47.417
And you know what,
I never got it.

54:47.701 --> 54:49.795
And you know what?

54:50.078 --> 54:51.830
Didn't need it.

54:52.122 --> 54:53.590
OK?

54:53.874 --> 54:59.347
So don't let him have another
moment of your life in sadness.

54:59.630 --> 55:02.930
You know, people
who are being abused

55:03.217 --> 55:05.595
or are abusing others, you
learned about yourself.

55:05.886 --> 55:08.435
You got to discuss yourselves
and what your hot buttons were,

55:08.722 --> 55:11.145
and how to handle yourself
when you're becoming angry.

55:11.433 --> 55:13.276
You know, how to
break that cycle.

55:13.560 --> 55:14.812
Ever since I had a
baby, fuck my life.

55:15.103 --> 55:16.480
I'm getting kicked
out of my mom's house

55:16.772 --> 55:19.275
even if I don't graduate,
which is fucked up.

55:19.566 --> 55:21.864
Because her husband wants
me to get kicked out.

55:22.152 --> 55:23.244
That's fucked up.

55:23.529 --> 55:25.577
I'm not graduating
because I had a baby,

55:25.864 --> 55:28.208
and since I focused on him
so much, I can't graduate.

55:28.492 --> 55:29.835
I never got to do my work.

55:30.118 --> 55:32.667
And since I deal with his
mother, who nags at me 24/7,

55:32.955 --> 55:34.047
I couldn't do my work.

55:34.331 --> 55:36.174
So altogether my life is fucked.

55:38.877 --> 55:39.924
You know what, honey?

55:40.212 --> 55:41.179
I'm going to tell
you, you're right.

55:41.463 --> 55:42.555
You don't have control
over your life,

55:42.840 --> 55:44.763
because you do have
a responsibility.

55:45.050 --> 55:46.393
But that's not a bad thing.

55:46.677 --> 55:48.975
I wanted to graduate
so bad, but I put so much--

55:49.263 --> 55:52.016
so much focus on the baby
and on the-- on the woman

55:52.307 --> 55:53.604
of the baby that--

55:53.892 --> 55:56.691
The problem started
before the baby came in.

55:56.979 --> 55:58.606
You had too much
going against you

55:58.897 --> 56:01.821
beforehand, because you needed
too many credits beforehand.

56:02.109 --> 56:04.453
It's an easy thing for you
to blame Layla and the baby,

56:04.736 --> 56:05.703
but that's not going to help.

56:05.988 --> 56:07.205
I don't want anything
to do anymore.

56:07.489 --> 56:08.206
I don't want to deal with
family or none of that.

56:08.490 --> 56:09.833
Because I see how it is now.

56:10.117 --> 56:10.959
I do
understand that.

56:11.243 --> 56:11.994
It's me all by myself.

56:12.286 --> 56:13.503
I've got to do it all by myself.

56:13.787 --> 56:15.460
I see no one-- no one is
going to be there for me.

56:19.459 --> 56:20.551
Lee.

56:20.836 --> 56:22.383
Whether the baby had
been there or not,

56:22.671 --> 56:25.094
you and I would have had the
same conversation this morning.

56:25.382 --> 56:26.850
And Layla, I don't want you
to take this personally.

56:27.134 --> 56:28.556
And you and I and
Lee will get together

56:28.844 --> 56:30.596
again later, after Lee gets
some of his frustrations out.

56:30.888 --> 56:32.356
It don't even
matter if I get a job,

56:32.639 --> 56:33.891
she fucked my life over anyways.

56:34.182 --> 56:36.105
OK, so go ahead
and go out, all right?

56:36.393 --> 56:38.236
OK.

56:38.520 --> 56:39.021
Lee.

56:51.867 --> 56:53.790
You and I talked on day one.

56:54.077 --> 56:55.920
And I told you that
this was going to be

56:56.204 --> 56:57.376
a huge responsibility, right?

56:57.664 --> 57:00.508
Remember that?

57:00.792 --> 57:01.839
And remember what
else I told you?

57:02.127 --> 57:03.219
I told you that I
believed that you

57:03.503 --> 57:04.755
could handle all
this responsibility,

57:05.047 --> 57:07.015
and you've done a good job.

57:07.299 --> 57:09.518
You're just
overwhelmed right now.

57:09.801 --> 57:13.556
You know in your heart that
she is not the problem.

57:13.847 --> 57:15.440
You've got a lot on
your plate right now.

57:15.724 --> 57:16.350
You've got several issues.

57:16.642 --> 57:17.894
You've got your mom.

57:18.185 --> 57:19.232
You've got school.

57:19.519 --> 57:20.020
You've Layla.

57:20.312 --> 57:22.064
You've got the baby.

57:22.356 --> 57:24.779
You've got the fact that you
want to be a teenager still.

57:25.067 --> 57:26.410
- I want to graduate.
- You want to graduate?

57:26.693 --> 57:27.990
It's not even I want to be
a teen-- I want to graduate.

57:28.278 --> 57:29.450
That's what it is.
- OK then.

57:29.738 --> 57:30.239
All right.

57:30.530 --> 57:31.031
You know what, Lee?

57:31.323 --> 57:33.291
If you-- show me.

57:33.575 --> 57:34.747
Show me.

57:35.035 --> 57:36.537
Get 2O credits this
credit check, sixth credit

57:36.828 --> 57:37.829
check, and then I'll
let you come back

57:38.121 --> 57:39.293
and finish in the fall.

57:39.581 --> 57:41.675
You and I both know
that there were

57:41.959 --> 57:44.462
times that Lee didn't
work because Lee

57:44.753 --> 57:45.879
didn't feel like it.

57:46.171 --> 57:47.764
All right, that
was my blame, but--

57:48.048 --> 57:48.924
Right.

57:49.216 --> 57:50.638
You need to stop
bitching about it.

57:50.926 --> 57:53.554
And if you want to make it work,
then I will give you my word

57:53.845 --> 57:55.722
that if you get
2O or more credits

57:56.014 --> 57:58.062
and are working during
this next credit check,

57:58.350 --> 58:00.023
I'll let you come back.

58:00.310 --> 58:03.814
I know, Lee, what a good man
you are and what a big heart

58:04.106 --> 58:05.403
you have.

58:05.691 --> 58:08.661
So don't act big, bad,
and tough with Layla

58:08.944 --> 58:09.911
and the ones you love.

01:00:35.132 --> 01:00:36.133
Ow, my eyes.

01:00:36.424 --> 01:00:37.391
Someone's gonna get
hit in the head.

01:00:54.234 --> 01:00:54.826
Light me on fire.

01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:56.327
Keep me warm!

01:01:16.798 --> 01:01:19.051
Hi, Mildred?

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:22.767
It's Ms. Ambrosius at
Black Rock High School.

01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:25.773
Hey, so we're a little
bit concerned about Joey.

01:01:26.057 --> 01:01:29.277
He's not here
again today, and he

01:01:29.561 --> 01:01:35.113
was out yesterday and last
Friday and-- what's going on?

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.617
Good morning.

01:01:36.902 --> 01:01:41.078
I'm assuming Joey's being
impossible this morning.

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:43.992
What did he do?

01:01:44.284 --> 01:01:45.786
He's gone?

01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:46.794
OK.

01:01:47.078 --> 01:01:49.422
Um, I would call the police.

01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:06.606
Yesterday
and the day before

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:08.358
and the day before for
that and the last two weeks

01:02:08.642 --> 01:02:09.985
I've been sleeping
on Daniel Debord's

01:02:10.268 --> 01:02:15.024
fucking recliner outside of
his shed, with a blanket.

01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:17.033
So I've been wearing the
same clothes for like two

01:02:17.317 --> 01:02:18.193
weeks, two and a half weeks.

01:02:26.952 --> 01:02:29.205
I really want to
graduate from Black Rock.

01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:30.873
You guys have to
understand that.

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:36.796
But it's just like-- but I'm
not going back to my mom's.

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:37.804
I'm not now.

01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:39.840
I just-- just stressed out.

01:02:40.131 --> 01:02:41.223
Need to get a job.

01:02:41.508 --> 01:02:43.351
Need to start paying
some bills, stop being

01:02:43.635 --> 01:02:45.137
dependent on somebody else.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.353
She's not-- she's
not a bad person.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.392
It's just, she changes when
the drugs are involved.

01:02:50.684 --> 01:02:51.810
And I don't even care
that she does drugs.

01:02:52.102 --> 01:02:54.355
I just wish she would
be consistent with me.

01:02:54.646 --> 01:02:55.898
She always talks
about wanting to bond

01:02:56.189 --> 01:02:59.363
and do stuff together, and
then, like, we never do.

01:02:59.651 --> 01:03:06.830
My momma told me
when I, when I was young,

01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:10.792
do as I say, not as I've done.

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:21.216
Be a simple man, just fall
in love, find you a girl

01:03:21.506 --> 01:03:23.679
that you can trust.

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:27.187
Then one clay I know
that you'll leave.

01:03:31.391 --> 01:03:36.147
That day came sooner
than she expected.

01:03:36.438 --> 01:03:42.616
I Wonder Why I
wanted to hang out

01:03:42.902 --> 01:03:47.078
with my best friend,
because you know,

01:03:47.365 --> 01:03:51.541
you were never my
mom in the end.

01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:57.005
You were never, you
were never in the end.

01:03:57.292 --> 01:04:03.971
Back in the days
when we used to say,

01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:11.436
I love you best, the moons and
stars, way beyond, way too far.

01:04:11.723 --> 01:04:18.402
I will always be the
one that you can,

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:25.370
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:04:25.653 --> 01:04:29.328
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:04:29.616 --> 01:04:31.744
No, no, no, no, no.

01:04:32.035 --> 01:04:33.127
So, have
you heard from Joey?

01:04:33.411 --> 01:04:34.879
Nah.

01:04:35.163 --> 01:04:37.086
Like I said, I'm always here
to catch him if he falls,

01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:38.671
but it's like, you
can't help someone

01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:40.551
who doesn't want to be helped.

01:04:40.835 --> 01:04:44.465
If he was really a situation
in which he couldn't go home,

01:04:44.756 --> 01:04:46.224
he would come to my house.

01:04:46.508 --> 01:04:47.976
And then usually when he
doesn't come to my house

01:04:48.259 --> 01:04:49.761
and he doesn't want to go
home, that's just the Whole,

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:51.600
you know, like, drugs thing.

01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:53.435
So like at this point,
I think he's just kind

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:55.316
of given up on himself.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.774
It's his future, you
know what I mean?

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:01.235
So how'd you get to be
so wise beyond your years?

01:05:01.523 --> 01:05:02.695
Like that joke I was
telling you, you know,

01:05:02.982 --> 01:05:04.199
I've been 18 since I was 13.

01:05:04.484 --> 01:05:06.236
So.

01:05:06.528 --> 01:05:09.702
Just-- just looking.

01:05:09.989 --> 01:05:10.990
I wish
I could bottle that.

01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:15.586
Jen!

01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:16.621
Yes?

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:20.008
Did you find your nail polish?

01:05:20.291 --> 01:05:22.089
This is not the
lipstick that is mine.

01:05:22.377 --> 01:05:25.130
Girl, let the.

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:26.799
Look!

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:29.843
You made it bigger, so now
it's like bigger on both sides.

01:05:30.135 --> 01:05:32.354
Make that side not
so.

01:05:32.637 --> 01:05:35.186
Mom, where are you?

01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:37.316
Mom, you need to
be here by 4:00!

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.692
I'm not giving you a hard time.

01:05:38.977 --> 01:05:40.354
I'm stressed out, Mom.

01:05:40.645 --> 01:05:42.363
I'm stressed.

01:05:42.647 --> 01:05:45.116
OK, well, can you just be here?

01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:52.533
Mom, I want you to be here!

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:19.817
It's OK.

01:06:20.101 --> 01:06:20.647
Cry.

01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:22.152
Let it out.

01:06:22.437 --> 01:06:24.235
You've been trying to
keep it in too long.

01:06:37.118 --> 01:06:37.914
OK.

01:06:38.203 --> 01:06:39.204
You're overwhelmed.

01:06:39.496 --> 01:06:40.622
You've got to feel
good about yourself.

01:06:40.914 --> 01:06:42.086
You've got to celebrate
your accomplishments.

01:06:42.373 --> 01:06:44.922
Because I'm going to
tell you, honey, in life?

01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:46.177
You're the one you can count on.

01:06:46.461 --> 01:06:46.962
All right?

01:06:56.304 --> 01:06:57.430
Teachers,
We will meet in Ms.

01:06:57.722 --> 01:06:58.894
Hill's room in five minutes.

01:06:59.182 --> 01:07:00.604
Thank you.

01:07:00.892 --> 01:07:05.648
With the students, you guys all
give of your heart and soul.

01:07:05.939 --> 01:07:08.283
And it's the hardest
job in the district.

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:13.367
What kind of toll does
working here have on you guys?

01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:16.078
You have to face
reality every single day.

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:17.834
You have to face
the same realities,

01:07:18.117 --> 01:07:19.414
in a way, every single day.

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:21.045
Because they're
not going anywhere.

01:07:21.329 --> 01:07:22.501
Their issues aren't
going anywhere.

01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:23.506
You get involved.

01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:24.837
You get personally involved.

01:07:25.124 --> 01:07:26.751
You're going to have
to take care of it.

01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:31.014
And that's emo-- that's
emotionally draining.

01:07:31.297 --> 01:07:32.765
I lose sleep.

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:35.552
I think about our kid who went
straight to a homeless shelter.

01:07:39.097 --> 01:07:42.727
I don't like that.

01:07:43.017 --> 01:07:45.395
I think
there are a lot of tears,

01:07:45.687 --> 01:07:48.440
because you do have
the weight of not just,

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:50.699
can they read the
assignment, but do they

01:07:50.984 --> 01:07:52.611
have a place to sleep tonight?

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:56.327
And do they have food?

01:07:56.614 --> 01:08:00.869
And buying gift
certificates for the family

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.753
that the grandma's
taken in all the kids,

01:08:03.037 --> 01:08:07.008
and buying water for the boy who
didn't have water at his house.

01:09:07.185 --> 01:09:10.189
Whoa, you
can see the whole thing!

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.153
That's great.

01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:13.111
So pretty!

01:09:22.908 --> 01:09:24.001
All right.

01:09:24.285 --> 01:09:25.502
Going to give you a
heads up that this

01:09:25.787 --> 01:09:28.085
is kind of a depressing,
overwhelming conversation.

01:09:28.372 --> 01:09:30.125
And I do it with all seniors.

01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:32.839
And it's-- I call it kind
of a facts of life speech.

01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:34.424
OK?

01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:35.508
So what we're going to do
is we're going to pretend

01:09:35.796 --> 01:09:37.765
you're 29, 12 years from now.

01:09:38.049 --> 01:09:39.517
Now what we're going to do
is we're going to look at,

01:09:39.801 --> 01:09:41.394
how are you going to
support your family?

01:09:41.678 --> 01:09:42.975
The more you know
about money, the easier

01:09:43.261 --> 01:09:44.309
your life is going to be.

01:09:44.596 --> 01:09:45.769
The better you are
with your money,

01:09:46.057 --> 01:09:48.526
the easier your life will be.

01:09:48.810 --> 01:09:49.935
Who wrote you a letter
of recommendation?

01:09:50.228 --> 01:09:51.024
This beautiful lady right here.

01:09:51.312 --> 01:09:52.359
This wonderful,
fabulous-- thank

01:09:52.647 --> 01:09:54.320
you so, so much Ms. Viland.

01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:56.075
I would be sucking
up to her and say,

01:09:56.359 --> 01:09:57.611
thank you, thank you for doing
this at the very last moment.

01:09:57.902 --> 01:10:00.496
Anytime somebody does something
for you, a short note.

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.908
Sincerely, comma, put
your name underneath.

01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:04.291
Put it in the
envelope, and you're

01:10:04.575 --> 01:10:06.043
going to hand it to them.

01:10:06.327 --> 01:10:08.375
I want you to start realizing
that not only are you in charge

01:10:08.663 --> 01:10:11.837
of your lives here, you're
in charge of your lives

01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:13.672
when you leave here.

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.337
So what I want us
to start doing is

01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:18.507
I want us to start getting that
initial plan for what you're

01:10:18.798 --> 01:10:20.721
going to do after Black Rock.

01:10:21.008 --> 01:10:23.978
What comes next, right?

01:10:24.262 --> 01:10:27.232
Now, what are your
plans for next year?

01:10:27.515 --> 01:10:30.234
Next year?

01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:31.735
Not sure.

01:10:32.019 --> 01:10:38.402
Well, hopefully get a
job at Petco and then--

01:10:38.693 --> 01:10:39.740
OK.

01:10:40.027 --> 01:10:42.280
Have you put in an
application with Petco?

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:43.164
Yeah.

01:10:43.448 --> 01:10:44.620
You did online?

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:45.954
Yes?

01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:48.665
Is there a reason
that you picked Petco?

01:10:48.953 --> 01:10:51.957
Um, I like animals.

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:53.966
And it's a new business, so--

01:10:57.295 --> 01:10:58.672
Layla, I
think that sometimes you

01:10:58.963 --> 01:11:01.807
sell yourself a little short.

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:03.593
I would like to see
you consider going

01:11:03.885 --> 01:11:06.058
out to Copper Mountain College.

01:11:06.345 --> 01:11:09.224
You're a smart young lady.

01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:10.437
But I think sometimes
you don't have

01:11:10.725 --> 01:11:11.851
enough confidence in yourself.

01:11:12.143 --> 01:11:13.235
And sometimes you need
somebody to remind you

01:11:13.519 --> 01:11:15.521
how smart you are.

01:11:15.813 --> 01:11:19.033
You can get your job
at Petco or wherever,

01:11:19.317 --> 01:11:21.160
and you can still go to college.

01:11:21.444 --> 01:11:22.661
And you can still be a mommy.

01:11:22.945 --> 01:11:24.697
And I know it's a lot to
juggle, but you know what?

01:11:24.989 --> 01:11:27.242
Women do it all the time.

01:11:27.533 --> 01:11:29.035
How are things going with Lee?

01:11:29.327 --> 01:11:30.294
Good.

01:11:30.578 --> 01:11:31.670
It's just sometimes--
he has his days

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:34.332
sometimes where he just
gives up on everything.

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:36.968
Right.

01:11:37.251 --> 01:11:38.343
Is he being good to you?

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:39.720
Yeah.

01:11:40.004 --> 01:11:41.005
OK.

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:43.095
Well, not when he's
acting like that.

01:11:43.382 --> 01:11:44.133
Not when he's acting like that.

01:11:47.178 --> 01:11:50.182
Here's the thing, is that you
deserve to be treated really,

01:11:50.473 --> 01:11:51.520
really nicely.

01:11:51.808 --> 01:11:54.482
And if you're not,
that's not good for you

01:11:54.769 --> 01:11:56.487
to put up with that, right?

01:11:56.771 --> 01:12:00.071
Because I care about you, and
I want to make sure you're OK.

01:12:00.358 --> 01:12:00.859
OK.

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:01.651
OK.

01:12:07.573 --> 01:12:08.745
Good morning!

01:12:09.033 --> 01:12:10.205
Good morning, good morning.

01:12:10.493 --> 01:12:11.289
How are you?

01:12:11.577 --> 01:12:14.296
I was so worried!

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.582
I had everybody looking for you!

01:12:16.874 --> 01:12:17.796
I'm so glad you're here!

01:12:26.092 --> 01:12:26.763
How are you?

01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:27.643
Doing better.

01:12:27.927 --> 01:12:28.473
Yeah?

01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:29.933
How's your mom?

01:12:30.221 --> 01:12:31.347
I'm not even going to ask.

01:12:31.639 --> 01:12:32.390
Joey.

01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:33.808
You still need a place to stay?

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:35.568
I got a place for
now, until it erupts.

01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:36.353
Then I don't know.

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:42.533
I missed my coffee pot.

01:12:42.817 --> 01:12:43.864
I missed my coffee grind.

01:12:44.151 --> 01:12:45.494
I miss-- I miss
everything about my house.

01:12:45.778 --> 01:12:47.746
I really do.

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:49.657
Why'd you leave?

01:12:49.949 --> 01:12:51.166
My mom.

01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:53.828
She just accused me of
stealing somebody's drugs.

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.622
I just woke up to her
screaming and yelling at me.

01:12:58.416 --> 01:12:59.588
Nothing new.

01:12:59.876 --> 01:13:02.595
I thought she was just
on another bad trip.

01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:04.301
I walked out the door.

01:13:04.589 --> 01:13:07.763
My mom was making it like a
joke, like, oh, Joey's leaving,

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:08.892
watch this!

01:13:09.176 --> 01:13:10.723
Thought I was joking.

01:13:11.012 --> 01:13:13.936
If I lived at my parents' house,
I'd invite you over to stay,

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:17.022
but I don't go there much.

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:19.358
I'm not mad at you for not
giving me a place to stay.

01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:20.692
It's a lot to ask, dude.

01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:22.482
That's Why I didn't eve ask.

01:13:22.773 --> 01:13:24.616
It's like, hey, friend's mom.

01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:26.369
Can my buddy Joey
say and live with us?

01:13:26.652 --> 01:13:29.656
And can you feed him and clothe
him and buy him a toothbrush?

01:13:33.784 --> 01:13:34.501
Hi.

01:13:34.785 --> 01:13:35.536
Hi.

01:13:35.828 --> 01:13:37.671
How are you?

01:13:37.955 --> 01:13:39.957
What does that mean?

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:41.466
I came to school.

01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:42.877
That's a step
in the right direction.

01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:44.136
That's a step in
the right direction.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:46.013
I needed to sleep
yesterday, though.

01:13:46.297 --> 01:13:48.174
I've slept in some
strange places.

01:13:49.634 --> 01:13:51.102
Such as?

01:13:51.385 --> 01:13:52.557
One was a bus stop.

01:13:54.013 --> 01:13:54.889
The
one in Twentynine?

01:13:55.181 --> 01:13:56.353
Yeah, over in.

01:13:56.641 --> 01:13:57.984
I slept at a bus stop there.

01:13:58.267 --> 01:13:59.564
That was the best one.

01:13:59.852 --> 01:14:00.603
And?

01:14:00.895 --> 01:14:02.647
The reason being?

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:04.191
I just, I wasn't going
back to that house.

01:14:04.482 --> 01:14:05.233
OK.
Why?

01:14:05.524 --> 01:14:06.320
What's going on at the house?

01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:09.658
It was just pretty rough.

01:14:09.946 --> 01:14:10.947
Mom being grumpy?

01:14:11.238 --> 01:14:12.034
She's always awake.

01:14:12.323 --> 01:14:13.040
What's that?

01:14:13.324 --> 01:14:14.496
She's always awake.

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:15.455
Are you partying?

01:14:15.743 --> 01:14:16.369
No, I--

01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:17.457
Are you clean?

01:14:17.745 --> 01:14:18.541
- Yeah, kind of.
- No you're not.

01:14:20.081 --> 01:14:20.582
I can tell by the
way you say that.

01:14:20.873 --> 01:14:21.715
Kind of.

01:14:21.999 --> 01:14:23.171
On and off.

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:24.961
You've been in here
bitching about the effect

01:14:25.252 --> 01:14:26.504
of that on your mom.

01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:28.048
It's just the only
way I can deal with her ass.

01:14:28.339 --> 01:14:30.762
I know, but do you see
the illogical path that is?

01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:32.267
I don't do what she does.

01:14:32.551 --> 01:14:33.598
I'm completely opposite of her.

01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:35.638
I've always been
opposite of her.

01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:36.977
Well,
what do you do then?

01:14:37.264 --> 01:14:37.765
What do I do?

01:14:38.057 --> 01:14:38.728
Mm-hmm.

01:14:39.016 --> 01:14:40.017
I like to clean the house.

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:41.060
I like to sit in my
room, play guitar

01:14:41.352 --> 01:14:42.228
or play with my little brother.

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:43.191
No,
I'm talking about

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:45.322
as far as drug usage goes.

01:14:45.606 --> 01:14:46.607
Oh, what do I--?

01:14:46.899 --> 01:14:49.277
I'm-- me and her are
in the same boat.

01:14:49.568 --> 01:14:50.785
Same stuff.

01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:52.242
Well, I
thought she was using meth.

01:14:52.530 --> 01:14:53.622
Mm.

01:14:53.906 --> 01:14:54.782
Oh dear god, Joey.

01:14:55.074 --> 01:14:56.200
Yeah.

01:14:56.492 --> 01:14:59.416
I've never-- it's just,
the last couple months

01:14:59.704 --> 01:15:00.330
have been too crazy.

01:15:03.124 --> 01:15:06.628
That, Joey, that-- I
have a pit in my stomach

01:15:06.919 --> 01:15:09.923
right now, honestly, about that.

01:15:10.214 --> 01:15:11.511
Ugh.

01:15:11.799 --> 01:15:14.177
I mean, honestly, you can
have all these great goals

01:15:14.468 --> 01:15:15.845
and everything.

01:15:16.137 --> 01:15:19.391
Just like I bet your mother
at your age had great goals.

01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:22.401
But when happened is she got
involved with drugs, right?

01:15:22.685 --> 01:15:23.857
Yeah.

01:15:24.145 --> 01:15:25.237
OK, so--

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:26.613
I still have hopes
and dreams, though.

01:15:26.897 --> 01:15:27.864
Well, but I'm saying
to you that the drugs

01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:28.866
will take those away.

01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:29.651
Nah.

01:15:34.071 --> 01:15:35.789
Are you going to
do the school thing and do"?

01:15:36.073 --> 01:15:36.574
Oh yeah.

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:37.788
I'm here.

01:15:38.075 --> 01:15:40.703
I'm going to graduate.

01:15:40.995 --> 01:15:41.746
OK.

01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:43.506
Here's what we're going to do.

01:15:43.789 --> 01:15:47.760
I would like to, for a while, I
would like to have a check-in,

01:15:48.044 --> 01:15:49.466
check-out with you.

01:15:49.754 --> 01:15:51.347
That means in the morning I'd
like you to check in with me

01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:53.883
and show me what you
did the night before.

01:15:54.175 --> 01:15:57.770
And one of the questions that
will always be asked was,

01:15:58.054 --> 01:15:59.931
are you clean today.

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:00.814
Yeah.

01:16:01.098 --> 01:16:01.519
All right.

01:16:27.708 --> 01:16:31.633
For those of you who aspire
to graduate this year,

01:16:31.921 --> 01:16:33.548
it's time to pick up the pace.

01:16:33.839 --> 01:16:38.595
Time to stop any wasting of time
and dreaming and socializing

01:16:38.886 --> 01:16:40.433
and start picking up the pace.

01:16:40.721 --> 01:16:45.522
This is everything as of
7 o'clock this morning, OK?

01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:47.357
Right now you have 10.5.

01:16:47.645 --> 01:16:51.115
I know you had a deal
with Ms. Viland about 20.

01:16:51.398 --> 01:16:54.277
So this next week you're
going to have to move on it.

01:16:54.568 --> 01:16:55.444
OK.

01:16:55.736 --> 01:16:56.328
And then you have
your government.

01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:57.454
I want you to focus on--

01:16:57.738 --> 01:16:58.785
English.

01:16:59.073 --> 01:17:01.701
--the English
and the histories.

01:17:01.992 --> 01:17:02.993
OK.

01:17:03.285 --> 01:17:04.537
Ooh, this
is going to be ugly.

01:17:04.829 --> 01:17:06.627
We really need to
get busy on this.

01:17:06.914 --> 01:17:07.665
Which one did you just turn in?

01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:09.004
Chapter one.

01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:10.167
Do you have
a computer at home?

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:11.802
No.

01:17:12.086 --> 01:17:13.588
So let's get you
in to one of the classrooms,

01:17:13.879 --> 01:17:17.429
get you zipping on A Plus,
and get this stuff done.

01:17:17.716 --> 01:17:18.933
On your mark, get set, go.

01:17:19.218 --> 01:17:20.811
So you will graduate
this credit check.

01:17:21.095 --> 01:17:22.642
There's no doubt in my mind.

01:17:22.930 --> 01:17:25.058
Yeah, I-- oh my
god, this is scary.

01:17:25.349 --> 01:17:26.225
I know, it is!

01:17:26.517 --> 01:17:28.770
I don't want to
leave high school.

01:17:29.061 --> 01:17:30.313
And
I've had students

01:17:30.604 --> 01:17:31.947
get done and keep coming here.

01:17:32.231 --> 01:17:33.232
They just keep coming.

01:17:33.524 --> 01:17:34.446
We don't kick you out.

01:17:34.733 --> 01:17:35.655
As long as you have
good attendance

01:17:35.943 --> 01:17:37.195
and aren't a
discipline problem, you

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:39.488
can come work on your
electives and read and work

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:41.077
on more things just
because you want to.

01:17:41.365 --> 01:17:43.288
You can get more
credits at our school.

01:17:43.576 --> 01:17:44.247
That's so scary.

01:17:44.535 --> 01:17:45.582
It is scary.

01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:47.338
What do you want to
do when you're done?

01:17:47.621 --> 01:17:49.544
I'm planning on working
up at Sky Hardware,

01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:51.800
but I don't want to
graduate high school.

01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:53.006
OK.
You know what?

01:17:53.294 --> 01:17:53.669
- I'm scared.
- You know what, Penny?

01:17:53.961 --> 01:17:54.632
Listen.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:56.263
You're not alone in that.

01:17:56.547 --> 01:17:57.639
You want to know how
many times I have

01:17:57.923 --> 01:17:58.719
this conversation with people?

01:17:59.008 --> 01:17:59.509
Because it's scary.

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.268
It's really scary.

01:18:01.552 --> 01:18:02.724
It is very scary.

01:18:03.012 --> 01:18:05.811
And I don't want to
graduate from high school.

01:18:06.098 --> 01:18:08.100
It's just scary
thinking about how

01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:10.144
I'm going to be an adult soon.

01:18:10.436 --> 01:18:12.530
I don't want to grow up.

01:18:12.813 --> 01:18:13.860
You know what?

01:18:14.148 --> 01:18:14.990
You don't have to grow up.

01:18:15.274 --> 01:18:16.025
Look at Ms. Ambrosius.

01:18:16.317 --> 01:18:17.193
Has she grown up yet?

01:18:17.484 --> 01:18:18.076
No.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.282
No, she hasn't.

01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:20.992
It just looks so hard.

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.829
Like, I watch my parents go
through it, and it's too hard.

01:18:24.116 --> 01:18:25.288
I don't want to do it.

01:18:25.576 --> 01:18:27.999
OK, what
scares you the most?

01:18:28.287 --> 01:18:29.755
I'm going on my own.

01:18:30.039 --> 01:18:32.087
Like, my parents said that I'm
gonna have to do it on my own.

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:35.173
Like, you're going to find
a way to do it on your own.

01:18:35.461 --> 01:18:39.511
They're going to
teach me how life is.

01:18:39.798 --> 01:18:41.675
That's just how my
parents grew up.

01:18:45.012 --> 01:18:46.389
Don't forget,
your service learning log

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:47.602
is worth a credit.

01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:49.358
You need to get
those pre-approved.

01:18:49.642 --> 01:18:54.443
So within the next Week I
want to see your PE-- psst!

01:18:54.730 --> 01:18:56.277
Within the next Week I
want to see your service

01:18:56.565 --> 01:18:58.033
learning log plans.

01:18:58.317 --> 01:18:59.569
What are We
going to do about Joey?

01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:02.329
I don't know what
to do about Joey.

01:19:02.613 --> 01:19:04.365
He needs counseling right now.

01:19:04.657 --> 01:19:06.910
He needs support.

01:19:07.201 --> 01:19:09.875
He needs somebody who
is there who cares.

01:19:10.162 --> 01:19:11.254
Because I ain't giving

01:19:11.538 --> 01:19:14.212
him a referral for counseling.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:15.376
Why-- he won't go.

01:19:15.668 --> 01:19:16.885
I know.

01:19:17.169 --> 01:19:18.546
I mean, I haven't put
a referral in either,

01:19:18.837 --> 01:19:20.555
because he tells me he
won't go, he won't do it.

01:19:20.839 --> 01:19:21.886
I've done it before,

01:19:22.174 --> 01:19:23.016
and that's what happens.

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:24.893
He doesn't go.

01:19:25.177 --> 01:19:27.179
I am-- I'm desperate
for solutions.

01:19:27.471 --> 01:19:29.894
I think he's using again.

01:19:30.182 --> 01:19:33.561
I just-- I'm worried
he's spiraling downward.

01:19:33.852 --> 01:19:35.320
And I don't know what more do.

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:36.696
Well, I-- yeah.

01:19:41.277 --> 01:19:43.826
The fact
that my dad is like not

01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:48.084
supporting me was really hard.

01:19:48.367 --> 01:19:50.586
He blame-- he thinks my
grandma's a horrible person.

01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:52.371
He doesn't like my mom.

01:19:52.663 --> 01:19:57.043
He thinks we're all-- he thinks
bad of my side of the family.

01:19:57.334 --> 01:20:00.258
And I think the fact that I grew
up with them and around them

01:20:00.546 --> 01:20:01.513
and the fact that
they raised me,

01:20:01.797 --> 01:20:03.094
he expected me to
be just like them.

01:20:03.382 --> 01:20:05.180
Which, my grandma's
not a bad person,

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:06.889
but, like, she didn't
graduate high school.

01:20:07.177 --> 01:20:09.521
My mom and my grandma,
they've all worked in bars.

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:13.025
He just expected me to be a part
of that cycle, which I'm not,

01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:14.481
which I think he's mad at.

01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:46.634
I see myself and what I've
been through, and I sit there

01:20:46.925 --> 01:20:51.601
and I think, how many other
people have been through this?

01:20:51.889 --> 01:20:53.516
I want a better my life.

01:20:53.807 --> 01:20:56.731
Better than my dad's,
better than my mom's.

01:20:57.019 --> 01:20:58.942
They used to tweak all the
time when I was little,

01:20:59.229 --> 01:21:00.856
and I've seen what
it's done to them.

01:21:04.443 --> 01:21:05.569
Not many people

01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:08.284
actually help people.

01:21:08.572 --> 01:21:10.870
They don't even, like, care
about other people's problems

01:21:11.158 --> 01:21:13.707
in this world.

01:21:13.994 --> 01:21:15.462
I just can't live like that.

01:21:21.043 --> 01:21:22.670
- I
- guess I'm just still a kid.

01:21:22.961 --> 01:21:25.180
L-- I still just
want to play around

01:21:25.464 --> 01:21:28.593
and mess around and stuff.

01:21:28.884 --> 01:21:32.309
And I feel like I've just been
prisoned in the high desert.

01:21:32.596 --> 01:21:33.597
I just need to get out of here.

01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:39.191
You
gotta learn how to just, like,

01:21:39.478 --> 01:21:41.446
kind of take care of yourself
and take care of your brothers.

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:45.780
And you just grow
up when you have to.

01:21:46.068 --> 01:21:47.615
I want to be my own person,

01:21:47.903 --> 01:21:50.782
be like accepted as such.

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:53.542
I don't look down on
people for little things

01:21:53.826 --> 01:21:55.294
like their past or anything.

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:58.797
What I look down on is, like,
if you have so much opportunity

01:21:59.081 --> 01:22:02.585
and you don't take it,
why do you choose to fail?

01:22:09.842 --> 01:22:11.435
You know,
I'm not mad at you at all.

01:22:11.718 --> 01:22:13.516
I'm more just like,
I can't be mad at you

01:22:13.804 --> 01:22:16.853
for something you're doing,
because it only affects you.

01:22:21.812 --> 01:22:23.564
I'm
more just upset.

01:22:23.856 --> 01:22:24.982
You know what's right and wrong.

01:22:25.274 --> 01:22:28.369
I can't be mad at
you for your life.

01:22:28.652 --> 01:22:32.247
I'm just upset because
you can do way better.

01:22:32.531 --> 01:22:34.454
You're smart.

01:22:34.741 --> 01:22:37.244
And you and I both know that
you're just choosing not to.

01:22:48.046 --> 01:22:51.767
Wha--
I'm-- help me out.

01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:54.018
Because what are you gonna--
what are you going to do?

01:22:54.303 --> 01:22:55.771
I know you turn 18 in a month?

01:22:56.054 --> 01:22:56.646
Two.

01:22:56.930 --> 01:22:57.476
Two months.

01:22:57.764 --> 01:22:59.641
What are your plans?

01:22:59.933 --> 01:23:00.809
I mean, you're
smart enough to know

01:23:01.101 --> 01:23:03.399
you've got to have some plans.

01:23:03.687 --> 01:23:04.404
I don't know yet.

01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:14.328
Your choice,
then, is to not play

01:23:14.615 --> 01:23:17.494
the game that you need to do.

01:23:17.784 --> 01:23:19.206
What game?

01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:22.044
The game where I have to find
something to eat every day?

01:23:22.331 --> 01:23:24.004
Yeah, I play that
game every day.

01:23:44.478 --> 01:23:45.070
Who's that?

01:23:45.354 --> 01:23:45.855
Your school ID.

01:23:46.146 --> 01:23:47.193
Do you have your ID?

01:23:47.481 --> 01:23:48.733
You guys do.

01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:49.741
No, we gave it to you.

01:23:50.025 --> 01:23:50.617
We don't keep your--

01:23:50.901 --> 01:23:52.278
You never gave it to me.

01:23:52.569 --> 01:23:54.071
At the beginning of the year,
the first week of school.

01:23:54.363 --> 01:23:55.080
You guys never gave me my ID.

01:23:55.364 --> 01:23:56.240
I never got it.

01:23:56.532 --> 01:23:57.954
Well, though, if
your mom's already

01:23:58.242 --> 01:23:59.789
receiving services for you and
you're back home, then you--

01:24:00.077 --> 01:24:02.045
My mom doesn't get shit.

01:24:02.329 --> 01:24:03.330
Are you-- where are you living?

01:24:03.622 --> 01:24:04.123
My grandma's.

01:24:04.414 --> 01:24:05.381
She's fucking broke.

01:24:05.666 --> 01:24:07.760
No, don't use that
profanity with me.

01:24:10.546 --> 01:24:11.763
We're going to start
doing things the way

01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:15.096
all students do things.

01:24:15.384 --> 01:24:16.636
So is x O in this case?

01:24:16.927 --> 01:24:17.974
- No.
- No.

01:24:18.262 --> 01:24:19.104
- So is it an intercept?
- No.

01:24:19.388 --> 01:24:20.480
No.

01:24:20.764 --> 01:24:22.061
So for us to see that
that's an intercept,

01:24:22.349 --> 01:24:23.896
x would be O right away, right?
OK, good.

01:24:24.184 --> 01:24:25.151
So it's not an intercept.

01:24:25.435 --> 01:24:27.688
But I do have a
point and a slope.

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:30.699
So I can start at
point-slope form, correct?

01:24:30.983 --> 01:24:34.738
Which is our new form that
We are learning, correct?

01:24:35.028 --> 01:24:36.575
So we can do
point-slope form with that?

01:24:36.863 --> 01:24:37.864
Point-slope.
Here We start with that.

01:24:38.156 --> 01:24:39.954
So it is y, right?

01:24:40.242 --> 01:24:40.788
Minus y.

01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:41.747
3-

01:24:42.035 --> 01:24:44.129
3, is equal to--

01:24:44.413 --> 01:24:45.039
1/4.

01:24:45.330 --> 01:24:46.047
Slope--

01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:46.923
Has a quality.

01:24:47.207 --> 01:24:48.333
--Which is 1/4.

01:24:48.625 --> 01:24:52.175
You're too fast for
us there. x-- What?

01:24:52.462 --> 01:24:52.963
Positive 2.

01:24:53.255 --> 01:24:53.972
Plus 2.

01:24:54.256 --> 01:24:57.351
Minus a negative--

01:24:57.634 --> 01:24:58.351
Little shoes.

01:25:07.853 --> 01:25:08.479
Good.

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:09.271
That's good.

01:25:11.982 --> 01:25:13.825
If you could bust out the
electives in the summer

01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:16.658
you can be at 65 or a
little bit lower for a year.

01:25:16.945 --> 01:25:18.822
Normally you do 60
in a year anyway,

01:25:19.114 --> 01:25:20.866
so totally doable for you.

01:25:21.158 --> 01:25:22.375
You did 2O this one.

01:25:22.659 --> 01:25:25.287
If you did 2O every single
credit check next year

01:25:25.579 --> 01:25:26.580
for the first two
credit checks, you'll

01:25:26.872 --> 01:25:29.295
be graduated at the semester.

01:25:29.583 --> 01:25:30.209
Woo-woo!

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:31.752
That'd be awesome, huh?

01:25:32.044 --> 01:25:33.466
See this right here?

01:25:33.754 --> 01:25:38.601
This shows us what we already
knew, that you could do it.

01:25:38.884 --> 01:25:40.761
You just have to decide
to, which you did.

01:25:41.053 --> 01:25:42.145
Which, that's what We want.

01:25:42.429 --> 01:25:43.021
OK?

01:25:43.305 --> 01:25:43.931
I'm proud of you.

01:25:44.222 --> 01:25:45.439
Nicely done.

01:25:45.724 --> 01:25:48.477
And I'll see you tomorrow
with your gift card, OK?

01:25:48.769 --> 01:25:49.440
Still here, Dad?

01:25:49.728 --> 01:25:50.229
Yeah.

01:26:09.206 --> 01:26:11.584
Hi, thank you for
calling me back.

01:26:11.875 --> 01:26:13.297
I know.

01:26:13.585 --> 01:26:15.838
I was excited to have him back,
but he just has fallen right

01:26:16.129 --> 01:26:16.880
back into the same patterns.

01:26:20.717 --> 01:26:22.685
So if you can talk
some sense into him

01:26:22.969 --> 01:26:24.892
and tell him to get productive
and do things, that's great.

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:26.602
If not, I need someone
to come get him.

01:26:26.890 --> 01:26:28.892
Because he just isn't doing
anything except being defiant.

01:26:35.982 --> 01:26:37.734
This is what he
wants to do all day.

01:26:38.026 --> 01:26:40.779
And when you ask him to do
anything, he throws a fit.

01:26:41.071 --> 01:26:43.950
Joseph, 9e'! UP!

01:26:44.241 --> 01:26:46.869
He doesn't want to work.

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:48.833
You know what, I don't know
what you're thinking, buddy,

01:26:49.121 --> 01:26:51.920
but whatever it is, it's
not working out for you.

01:26:52.207 --> 01:26:54.801
You've lived on the streets,
you've lived in shit holes.

01:26:57.671 --> 01:26:59.719
Get up, Joe.

01:27:00.006 --> 01:27:00.882
Are We leaving?

01:27:01.174 --> 01:27:01.675
Get up.

01:27:01.967 --> 01:27:02.968
Pull your pants up.

01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:04.682
Where's your jacket?

01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:06.517
He never had one this morning
when he got off the bus.

01:27:06.805 --> 01:27:08.148
Yeah he did.
He has a black jacket somewhere.

01:27:08.432 --> 01:27:09.479
He left.

01:27:09.766 --> 01:27:10.858
Oh, did he put it
in my office already?

01:27:11.143 --> 01:27:11.894
He must've put it in
before I talked to him.

01:27:15.605 --> 01:27:18.108
I hope that he'll be--
when he's ready to learn,

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:19.743
we'll be here for him.

01:27:20.026 --> 01:27:21.573
If and when he turns 18, he
decides he's dropping out,

01:27:21.862 --> 01:27:23.830
call me, and then I'll just
classify him as a drop-out out

01:27:24.114 --> 01:27:25.206
and fill his spot with somebody.

01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:27.492
I hope he doesn't make
that decision, but--

01:27:27.784 --> 01:27:28.330
You know what?

01:27:28.618 --> 01:27:29.164
everybody"

01:27:29.453 --> 01:27:29.954
He has you.

01:27:30.245 --> 01:27:30.746
He has AJ.

01:27:31.037 --> 01:27:32.084
He has his support.

01:27:32.372 --> 01:27:34.716
Everybody has a sad
story that brings

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.001
them to right now and today.

01:27:36.293 --> 01:27:37.340
Yeah.

01:27:37.627 --> 01:27:38.503
It's they can either
be a victim of it--

01:27:38.795 --> 01:27:39.170
It's what they're
gonna do with it.

01:27:39.463 --> 01:27:40.180
Or--

01:27:40.464 --> 01:27:41.511
Yeah.

01:27:41.798 --> 01:27:43.050
I mean, that's what--
he's at the point

01:27:43.341 --> 01:27:44.092
now where either choose,
you're going to be a victim

01:27:44.384 --> 01:27:45.806
or you're going to go forward.

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:46.640
Yeah.

01:27:46.928 --> 01:27:47.474
OK.

01:28:16.875 --> 01:28:18.001
So what-- what's the plan?

01:28:18.293 --> 01:28:19.294
I don't know.

01:28:19.586 --> 01:28:20.803
I've been working
more lately, though.

01:28:21.087 --> 01:28:23.385
Well, more is not quite
enough, I'm sorry to say.

01:28:23.673 --> 01:28:28.554
Going from 10% up to
30% is not enough.

01:28:28.845 --> 01:28:29.892
With
my attendance,

01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:31.022
I've been doing good
with my attendance.

01:28:31.306 --> 01:28:32.523
You're better.
Better.

01:28:32.808 --> 01:28:33.559
My only
problem is sleep, though.

01:28:33.850 --> 01:28:34.772
Like, when I don't sleep--

01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:36.027
but-- just a second.

01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:36.903
You know what?

01:28:37.187 --> 01:28:40.157
It's time to grow up.

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:41.111
Go.

01:28:41.399 --> 01:28:43.242
Use your time wisely.

01:28:43.527 --> 01:28:45.370
Give me your phone, Alexis.

01:28:45.654 --> 01:28:47.827
You and I had a talk
about this the other day.

01:28:48.114 --> 01:28:49.457
Yeah, but I
shut the power off.

01:28:49.741 --> 01:28:50.663
Doesn't matter.

01:28:50.951 --> 01:28:51.543
I wasn't
texting or anything.

01:28:51.827 --> 01:28:52.544
It's not your opinion.

01:28:52.828 --> 01:28:53.249
Hand me your phone, Alexis.

01:28:53.537 --> 01:28:54.413
What if I don't?

01:28:54.704 --> 01:28:55.421
Then
I'll suspend you.

01:28:55.705 --> 01:28:56.547
Then suspend me.

01:29:12.597 --> 01:29:14.065
"On the way
home from the field trip,

01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:16.022
we had a bus pull
over due to Brianna's

01:29:16.309 --> 01:29:18.186
yelling profanity and
threatening physical injury

01:29:18.478 --> 01:29:19.525
to another student.

01:29:19.813 --> 01:29:24.284
I was certain she
was going to hit me."

01:29:24.568 --> 01:29:26.662
Obviously I have to go
through with the expulsion.

01:29:26.945 --> 01:29:28.822
And this process is going to
hurt me just as much as it

01:29:29.114 --> 01:29:34.587
hurts you, because your daughter
is-- your daughter is me

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:37.123
40 years ago.

01:29:37.414 --> 01:29:39.963
I do not want this to
be a roadblock for you.

01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:43.094
I do not want this
to set you back.

01:29:43.378 --> 01:29:46.131
We all cried a little
bit on Friday together.

01:29:46.423 --> 01:29:47.800
Because we love you.

01:29:48.091 --> 01:29:50.264
We love you.

01:29:50.552 --> 01:29:53.522
And we all make mistakes,
and we learn from them,

01:29:53.805 --> 01:29:54.977
and we go forward.

01:31:44.332 --> 01:31:45.504
Hello!

01:31:45.792 --> 01:31:47.089
Hi!

01:31:47.377 --> 01:31:49.129
I was gonna ask
you, I kind of want to say

01:31:49.421 --> 01:31:50.388
something to them about my--

01:31:50.672 --> 01:31:51.764
That'd be perfect!

01:31:52.048 --> 01:31:53.220
How Black
Rock changed my little--

01:31:53.508 --> 01:31:55.556
That would
be great!

01:31:55.844 --> 01:31:57.812
I was just thinking about it
last night, because Black R-

01:31:58.096 --> 01:31:59.348
it did make a big
difference to me,

01:31:59.639 --> 01:32:00.936
and I want them to
know that the school

01:32:01.224 --> 01:32:03.022
is very important to the
kids that are at this school.

01:32:03.309 --> 01:32:04.310
That
would be really great.

01:32:04.602 --> 01:32:07.856
What you can do is
right after you show all

01:32:08.148 --> 01:32:09.365
the senior pictures,
you can say,

01:32:09.649 --> 01:32:11.822
and I'd like to take a
minute personally to--

01:32:12.110 --> 01:32:13.202
That's
exactly what I wrote!

01:32:13.486 --> 01:32:14.408
I'm so proud of myself.

01:32:14.696 --> 01:32:15.822
Perfect.

01:32:16.114 --> 01:32:17.582
Students drop
out for many reasons,

01:32:17.866 --> 01:32:21.245
but the number one reason is not
having a personal relationship

01:32:21.536 --> 01:32:26.667
with a caring adult. High school
graduates live longer, are less

01:32:26.958 --> 01:32:29.006
likely to be teen parents,
are more likely to raise

01:32:29.294 --> 01:32:31.296
healthier and
better-educated children,

01:32:31.588 --> 01:32:34.216
are more likely to engage
in civic activities

01:32:34.507 --> 01:32:37.351
like voting and volunteering.

01:32:37.635 --> 01:32:39.763
Continuation schools
make a difference.

01:32:40.055 --> 01:32:42.604
We hope you will take a minute
to read the report being

01:32:42.891 --> 01:32:44.268
passed out to you.

01:32:51.816 --> 01:32:53.864
I would also like to
add on a personal note,

01:32:54.152 --> 01:32:57.656
just for me, without Black Rock
I don't think I would have had

01:32:57.947 --> 01:32:59.824
put the effort into
even trying to graduate,

01:33:00.116 --> 01:33:01.914
nor have the confidence
to be graduating a year

01:33:02.202 --> 01:33:03.203
early this year.

01:33:03.495 --> 01:33:04.747
So I would like to
thank all the staff

01:33:05.038 --> 01:33:06.130
and teachers at Black Rock.

01:33:06.414 --> 01:33:08.462
And thank you guys for
keeping Black Rock.

01:33:15.632 --> 01:33:16.884
I knew
you could do it.

01:33:17.175 --> 01:33:19.849
I wasn't worried.

01:33:20.136 --> 01:33:22.264
Pretty cool, huh?

01:33:22.555 --> 01:33:23.932
This is about you.

01:33:24.224 --> 01:33:27.148
Because Lee, anything you set
your mind to, you will do.

01:33:30.313 --> 01:33:32.611
I got my 2O credits,
so I'm gonna be here

01:33:32.899 --> 01:33:35.618
next year to finish for good.

01:33:35.902 --> 01:33:37.074
I didn't believe in myself.

01:33:37.362 --> 01:33:38.454
I didn't think I can do it.

01:33:38.738 --> 01:33:41.082
But Layla talked to
me, gave me some hope.

01:33:41.366 --> 01:33:44.540
She told me that she knows I'm
smart, and putting myself down

01:33:44.828 --> 01:33:46.546
isn't gonna help me
with my education

01:33:46.830 --> 01:33:47.547
and further me in life.

01:33:53.711 --> 01:33:55.008
All
right, let's check.

01:33:55.296 --> 01:33:58.516
Make sure I got everything here.

01:33:58.800 --> 01:33:59.517
Attention.

01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:05.477
Are we missing something?

01:34:09.185 --> 01:34:10.437
Nope, we're good.

01:34:10.728 --> 01:34:11.820
You're done!

01:34:12.105 --> 01:34:13.322
Oh, I'm think I'm gonna
have a heart attack.

01:34:13.606 --> 01:34:15.449
You're done,
you're done, you're done!

01:34:15.733 --> 01:34:19.909
OK, so let's go to the
next step here, huh?

01:34:20.196 --> 01:34:22.915
And that is checking
out of school!

01:34:37.630 --> 01:34:41.760
MS. Vll_AND: You still need 10
in English, 4 in government,

01:34:42.051 --> 01:34:43.519
5 in econ.

01:34:43.803 --> 01:34:48.400
So you still could make it this
year, if you busted your ass.

01:34:48.683 --> 01:34:50.356
You're gonna make it!

01:35:28.181 --> 01:35:29.478
Did you finish, baby?

01:35:29.766 --> 01:35:31.439
Yay!

01:35:31.726 --> 01:35:33.945
I needed that.

01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:34.900
Now give hers.

01:35:35.188 --> 01:35:38.738
The last two, yay yay yay.

01:35:39.025 --> 01:35:42.655
Tough, very good thing.

01:35:42.946 --> 01:35:45.995
You're awesome.

01:35:46.282 --> 01:35:47.408
- I am so happy.
- Yay!

01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:48.201
I'm proud of you.

01:35:48.493 --> 01:35:50.086
Happy tears.

01:35:50.370 --> 01:35:51.917
I'm so haPPY-

01:35:52.205 --> 01:35:53.172
I'm happy for you.

01:36:11.933 --> 01:36:13.480
Round and round.

01:36:13.768 --> 01:36:15.736
Spinning my head until
I hit the ground.

01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:17.647
Take a deep breath,
let's leave this town.

01:36:21.651 --> 01:36:23.198
Let's leave this fucking town.

01:36:33.538 --> 01:36:35.040
I don't know who you are, hi!

01:36:35.331 --> 01:36:36.799
Yeah, hi, my name's Adam.

01:36:37.083 --> 01:36:38.209
Hi, Adam, nice to meet you.

01:36:38.501 --> 01:36:39.878
It's nice to meet you.

01:36:40.169 --> 01:36:44.140
Um, I was-- I was wondering,
do you accept ninth graders?

01:36:44.424 --> 01:36:45.641
Oh, no, honey.

01:36:45.925 --> 01:36:47.723
We only have 11th
and 12th graders.

01:36:48.011 --> 01:36:49.558
Because we have a waiting
list even for them.

01:36:51.431 --> 01:36:52.227
Where are you
going to school right now?

01:36:52.515 --> 01:36:54.188
Right I'm going
to Hope Academy.

01:36:54.475 --> 01:36:55.727
But I'm trying to
get out of there

01:36:56.019 --> 01:36:57.646
because I need a more, like,
structured environment,

01:36:57.937 --> 01:36:58.483
you know?

01:36:58.771 --> 01:36:59.943
Right?

01:37:00.231 --> 01:37:02.359
Because at Hope I
can just, like-- I

01:37:02.650 --> 01:37:05.119
can pretty much just walk out
whenever I want.

01:37:05.403 --> 01:37:07.201
Yeah, that
wouldn't fly here, would it?

01:37:07.488 --> 01:37:09.161
Yeah, unfortunately--
we used to take

01:37:09.449 --> 01:37:11.247
10th, 11th, and 12th graders.

01:37:11.534 --> 01:37:13.536
But now we can only take
11th and 12th graders

01:37:13.828 --> 01:37:17.833
because we're so full with
just 11th and 12th graders.

01:37:18.124 --> 01:37:20.593
All I can say is, keep going to
school, keep earning credits,

01:37:20.877 --> 01:37:22.879
and when you get into the
11th grade, we can take you.

01:37:23.171 --> 01:37:24.013
- OK.
- OK.

01:37:24.297 --> 01:37:25.514
I'm sorry.

01:37:25.798 --> 01:37:27.095
Well, is there a way I can
get on the waiting list,

01:37:27.383 --> 01:37:28.350
so right when--

01:37:28.634 --> 01:37:30.227
We'll take your
name, yes, absolutely.

01:37:30.511 --> 01:37:33.264
We'll put it in our book, and
then the end of your 10th grade

01:37:33.556 --> 01:37:35.399
year we'll give you a call.

01:37:35.683 --> 01:37:36.479
- Thank you.
- You bet.

01:37:36.768 --> 01:37:37.564
Absolutely.

01:37:37.852 --> 01:37:38.944
I've got to go meet the bus.

01:37:39.228 --> 01:37:40.229
It was nice meeting
you, and I admire you.

01:37:40.521 --> 01:37:41.613
You did a good job.

01:37:46.944 --> 01:37:47.991
Hi, everyone!

01:37:48.279 --> 01:37:49.906
Welcome, welcome.

01:37:50.198 --> 01:37:51.324
Morning!
