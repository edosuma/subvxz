43:06.200 --> 43:09.066
[upbeat music]

43:09.100 --> 43:12.233
- Aloha.
- Ah, we made it!

43:12.266 --> 43:13.734
- Cheers.
- Here's to--

43:13.767 --> 43:16.133
should we make a toast to, uh--

43:16.166 --> 43:17.700
who's getting married?

43:17.734 --> 43:19.400
[laughter]

43:19.433 --> 43:25.233
- Something seemed
a little off with Mauricio.

43:25.266 --> 43:26.734
- What am I going to do
with the Umansky name?

43:26.767 --> 43:28.166
Should we just
have another kid?

43:28.200 --> 43:29.200
Just a boy,
just for the sake of it?

43:29.233 --> 43:31.333
- Honey, are you kidding me?

43:31.367 --> 43:33.633
- Do you have a thing
for bad boys?

43:33.667 --> 43:36.033
- Are you considered a bad boy?
- Yeah.

43:36.066 --> 43:38.767
Yeah, now we're talking.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.734
- We have the opportunity to
scale, like, now and big time.

43:41.767 --> 43:45.667
- But do you think that this
is at the expense of the kids?

43:45.700 --> 43:47.367
- Well, baby, you can still--

43:47.400 --> 43:49.367
- I want them to know
that I'm always there.

43:49.400 --> 43:51.000
- What am I
supposed to be doing?

43:51.033 --> 43:52.467
- Just walk.
- It's been a long time

43:52.500 --> 43:55.100
since I was a bridesmaid.
Since I was in my 20s.

43:55.133 --> 43:57.500
I'm going to get out there.
I will hold her train.

43:57.533 --> 43:59.767
I will help lift her veil.
Whatever she wants.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.233
- This is it.
- It's official.
