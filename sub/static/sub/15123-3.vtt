00:01.969 --> 00:05.139
(booming footsteps)

00:05.206 --> 00:07.775
(roaring)

00:07.841 --> 00:09.943
(crashing, rumbling)

00:10.010 --> 00:12.513
(roaring)

00:15.183 --> 00:16.984
(woman screaming)

00:17.051 --> 00:18.686
(growls)

00:18.752 --> 00:20.754
(airplane engines buzzing)

00:24.092 --> 00:26.827
Out of all the videos
of cities being destroyed,

00:26.894 --> 00:28.696
I'm going to go
out on a limb

00:28.762 --> 00:30.064
and say this
is the cutest.

00:30.131 --> 00:32.133
(cell phone ringtone playing)

00:32.200 --> 00:33.234
Oh, you know,
that's probably Wyatt.

00:33.301 --> 00:34.502
Oh, yeah, that's right.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.137
Supposed to be in town
for the weekend.

00:36.204 --> 00:37.205
We're supposed to go

00:37.271 --> 00:38.472
to dinner tonight,

00:38.539 --> 00:40.641
but he hasn't even
told me the place yet.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.543
Nope. Nope.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.578
That is just a text

00:44.645 --> 00:46.480
telling me
I have an e-mail

00:46.547 --> 00:48.549
asking me if I would like
to continue the service

00:48.616 --> 00:50.718
that sends me a text every
time I get an e-mail.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.720
Oh, I got to get one
of those smartphones.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.688
(knock at door)

00:55.889 --> 00:57.891
Hi.

00:57.958 --> 01:00.027
Is Burt here?

01:00.094 --> 01:01.028
I'm an old friend.

01:01.095 --> 01:02.930
Uh... oh. Hey, come on in.

01:02.996 --> 01:04.265
Yeah, I'm his son, Jimmy.

01:04.332 --> 01:06.100
Dad's at the store,
but he'll be back soon.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.502
He, uh, saw my daughter
in a gorilla suit

01:08.569 --> 01:09.903
and had a craving
for bananas.

01:09.970 --> 01:10.971
(man laughing)

01:11.038 --> 01:12.606
I'm Jack.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.041
(gasps)

01:14.108 --> 01:17.044
Hey. I'm Sabrina.

01:17.111 --> 01:18.779
What's your ponytail's name?

01:18.846 --> 01:20.248
Magnus.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.882
Well, uh, you know,
make yourself comfortable.

01:21.949 --> 01:24.385
Any friend of my dad's
is a friend of mine.

01:24.452 --> 01:26.154
And, of course,
you must know my mother.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.555
(grunts)

01:27.621 --> 01:29.557
Oh!
What...

01:29.623 --> 01:30.724
(exhales)

01:32.326 --> 01:34.094
* Whoo! *

01:34.162 --> 01:36.830
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh *

01:36.897 --> 01:38.499
* Oh, oh, oh. *

01:38.566 --> 01:40.234
SABRINA: Oh!
Aah! Mom, what the...?

01:40.301 --> 01:43.171
This is the man that
kidnapped your father.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.305
Dad was kidnapped?

01:44.372 --> 01:45.739
Not today. 20 years ago.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.943
I may forget a face,

01:50.010 --> 01:52.079
but I never forget

01:52.146 --> 01:53.681
a unique hairstyle.

01:53.747 --> 01:56.350
I love to scream!
I love to scream!

01:56.417 --> 01:58.619
What kind of man lets
his car run out of gas?

01:58.686 --> 02:00.488
The kind whose wife
always insists

02:00.554 --> 02:02.156
on sticking her feet
out the window.

02:02.223 --> 02:04.158
I was drying my toenails!

02:04.225 --> 02:05.526
It's extra drag.

02:05.593 --> 02:07.495
That's why we get four miles
to the gallon.

02:07.561 --> 02:08.629
Oh, sure.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.798
What about your jack
rabbit stops and starts?

02:10.864 --> 02:14.402
What about your never checking
proper tire inflation?

02:14.468 --> 02:18.372
'Cause I don't understand
pounds of air.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.343
Give me some money.

02:22.410 --> 02:24.912
I'll pay, you pump.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.851
$1.13?
Yeah.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.119
And get me half a Slim Jim.

02:32.186 --> 02:33.487
They do that for me here.

02:33.554 --> 02:34.522
No.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.824
Keep an eye on that creepy guy
by the RV.

02:36.890 --> 02:39.227
He keeps staring at Jimmy.

02:45.132 --> 02:46.367
I want my truck!

02:59.913 --> 03:02.250
What the hell you staring
at my kid for, hippie?

03:02.316 --> 03:04.785
(sighing)

03:12.426 --> 03:14.728
Hi there, Virginia.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.697
Hot one out there, huh?

03:16.764 --> 03:18.432
Of course, not as hot
as the snap

03:18.499 --> 03:20.100
you and I had in sixth grade.

03:20.167 --> 03:21.435
Our little movie date.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.539
They made us watch a film
about the reproductive cycle.

03:25.606 --> 03:26.707
(chuckling)

03:26.774 --> 03:29.577
And there were, like,
30 other kids there.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.579
Plus aren't you the one
who threw up?

03:31.645 --> 03:33.881
Did you come out
of an owl's mouth?

03:33.947 --> 03:35.583
'Cause you are a hoot.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.818
By the way, you look
kind of thirsty.

03:37.885 --> 03:40.788
Guess Burt can't afford
to keep his lady hydrated.

03:40.854 --> 03:43.291
You want a sip of my soda?
I couldn't.

03:43.357 --> 03:44.925
Ooh, your lips say you couldn't,

03:44.992 --> 03:48.896
but the sweat glistening
in your glorious cleavage says,

03:48.962 --> 03:50.831
"Me want sippy-sippy."

03:57.471 --> 03:59.440
Hey, lady. Lady.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.309
That hippie dude pulled a gun
on your husband

04:01.375 --> 04:03.444
and forced him in his RV.

04:03.511 --> 04:05.346
They went that way.

04:05.413 --> 04:07.548
Oh, my God.

04:07.615 --> 04:10.351
Burt's been kidnapped.

04:12.019 --> 04:16.324
So hippie weirdo here sells
your dad to a farm in Mexico

04:16.390 --> 04:19.493
and makes him
pick cauliflower for weeks.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.929
He finally escaped and
hitchhiked all the way home.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.565
That's the reason your father's
always hated cauliflower.

04:24.632 --> 04:25.866
No, I thought it was because
it's not

04:25.933 --> 04:27.167
a real flower
and it looks like brains.

04:27.234 --> 04:29.603
Fine, he has a lot of good
reasons to hate cauliflower.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.440
Sabrina, Jimmy and me are going
to keep an eye on this guy.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.775
You go get some rope
and call the cops.
Will do.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.577
How did you never tell me
Dad was kidnapped?

04:36.644 --> 04:38.746
We didn't want you to
be afraid of strangers.

04:38.812 --> 04:41.749
Kids are supposed to be
afraid of strangers.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.253
Bananas.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.121
That's what I forgot.

04:48.188 --> 04:49.690
(stammers)

04:49.757 --> 04:51.392
What, uh...
what's going on here?

04:51.459 --> 04:52.793
It's your kidnapper.

04:52.860 --> 04:55.128
He came back.

04:55.195 --> 04:57.297
Oh, my God.
What... what did he...

04:57.365 --> 04:59.099
why is he on the floor
like that?

04:59.166 --> 05:00.634
I whacked him with the TV.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.135
I'm getting pretty
good at it.

05:02.202 --> 05:04.071
Oh, this is bad.
This is really bad.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.473
Burt, it's okay.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.107
Sabrina's getting rope
and calling the cops.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.442
No, no, no cops!

05:08.509 --> 05:09.977
Virginia, they'll throw you
in jail for...

05:10.043 --> 05:11.244
for hitting him on the head.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.446
What are you talking about?

05:12.513 --> 05:13.981
He's the one
who's going to jail.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.182
Yeah, he kidnapped you.

05:15.248 --> 05:16.950
He didn't kidnap me.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.686
(Sabrina grunts)

05:21.288 --> 05:23.557
Wait. Did you say "didn't?"

05:27.127 --> 05:29.129
VIRGINIA: Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:29.196 --> 05:31.899
What do you mean,
he didn't kidnap you?

05:31.965 --> 05:34.735
Well, kind of exactly
what it sounds like.

05:34.802 --> 05:37.471
What the hell you staring
at my kid for, hippie?

05:37.538 --> 05:39.640
Dude, I'm checking
out your cool car.

05:39.707 --> 05:41.709
I'm a big car fan.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.777
It's a '63 Ford Galaxie, right?

05:43.844 --> 05:46.213
Yeah.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.215
That's a cool
ponytail.

05:48.281 --> 05:51.985
Six years,
eight months, right?

05:54.187 --> 05:55.255
On Tuesday.

05:55.322 --> 05:57.124
Burt Chance.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.460
I'm a big hair fan.

05:59.527 --> 06:01.028
Drink as much
as you like.

06:01.094 --> 06:02.496
I get unlimited
refills.

06:02.563 --> 06:07.468
And, uh, I give
unlimited refills as a lover.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.138
(honking horn)

06:11.204 --> 06:13.106
Wow.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.509
No responsibilities.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.244
You just drive
around in your RV,

06:17.310 --> 06:18.846
and you do
whatever you want.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.448
That is so cool.

06:20.514 --> 06:21.915
Yeah, I just got back
from seeing

06:21.982 --> 06:23.350
the world's
largest thermometer.

06:23.417 --> 06:26.086
I always wanted
to see that.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.455
But I never got the chance.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.523
I went from being stuck
in my parents' house

06:29.590 --> 06:31.459
to being stuck in my
Maw Maw-in-law's house.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.661
I guess I'll never
get to see

06:33.727 --> 06:35.729
the world's
largest anything.

06:35.796 --> 06:38.331
Unless that's the world's
largest ponytail.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.935
Nah, there's a guy in Tucson
who's got three more inches.

06:42.002 --> 06:42.903
Damn it.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.372
You could come with me.
What?

06:45.439 --> 06:48.476
I'm just saying, if things
are as bad as they looked,

06:48.542 --> 06:51.044
maybe your wife would be
better off without you.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.146
(horn honking)

06:53.213 --> 06:54.648
Burt!

06:54.715 --> 06:58.151
You put back the stupid milk
with one sip left!

06:58.218 --> 07:00.153
(groans)

07:02.289 --> 07:03.891
(groaning)

07:03.957 --> 07:05.793
Burt! God.

07:05.859 --> 07:08.762
Your stupid leg
is on my leg.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.966
Burt, you left the stupid
toilet seat up!

07:13.033 --> 07:15.803
(grunting)

07:15.869 --> 07:17.137
(horn honking)

07:17.204 --> 07:19.406
Well, I don't think my wife
would miss me much, but...

07:19.473 --> 07:21.208
I don't know.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.843
I got a kid.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.478
I don't know how the
little guy would feel

07:24.545 --> 07:26.514
if his old man just up
and took off on him.

07:33.721 --> 07:35.689
Let's do this.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.658
BURT: I told that kid
to make up a story

07:37.725 --> 07:38.792
about me being kidnapped.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.594
We headed out on the open road.

07:40.661 --> 07:43.096
No wife, no kid,
no responsibilities.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.499
Just me,
a dude with a ponytail

07:45.566 --> 07:48.736
whose name I had already
forgotten, and our dreams.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.438
For the first time, I only had
to worry about feeding myself.

07:51.505 --> 07:54.374
And Jack always knew
how to find amazing food.

07:54.441 --> 07:56.343
Sweet.

07:56.409 --> 07:59.580
Someone ate the "B", but they
left the "L" and the "T."

07:59.647 --> 08:01.715
Entertainment was no problem

08:01.782 --> 08:04.117
'cause Jack had
a universal remote.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.186
* Ooh, I'm drivin'
my life away... *

08:06.253 --> 08:09.557
At home, we always had
to watch Jimmy's cartoons.

08:09.623 --> 08:12.325
I never got to watch
my cartoons.

08:12.392 --> 08:14.494
To earn beer money,
we sold our blood.

08:14.562 --> 08:18.298
And because we had less blood,
it took less beer to get drunk.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.800
* Lookin' for a sunny day... *

08:19.867 --> 08:22.570
And I finally got
to see the world.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.242
* Well, the midnight
headlights *

08:29.309 --> 08:30.844
* Blind you on a rainy night *

08:30.911 --> 08:32.445
* Steep grade up ahead *

08:32.512 --> 08:35.015
* Slow me down, makin' no time *

08:35.082 --> 08:38.485
* I gotta keep rollin' *

08:38.552 --> 08:40.053
* Those windshield wipers... *

08:40.120 --> 08:41.889
BURT:
For the first time in my life,

08:41.955 --> 08:44.291
I was living by my rules,
doing whatever I wanted.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.593
I was free.

08:45.659 --> 08:46.827
Things were awesome.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.762
Until this happened.

08:53.701 --> 08:56.236
(grunts)
What the hell is going on?

08:56.303 --> 08:58.371
Nothing.

08:58.438 --> 08:59.707
I was just kissing you
a little.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.842
Why? Why? Why were you
just kissing me a little?

09:01.909 --> 09:03.310
'Cause I felt
like doing some kissing.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.878
It was no big deal.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.847
Don't you ever feel
like doing some kissing?

09:06.914 --> 09:08.616
Yeah, but not with dudes.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.450
I'm not into dudes, dude.

09:10.517 --> 09:12.185
Me, neither.

09:12.252 --> 09:13.621
But you know what?

09:13.687 --> 09:17.424
It's just the two of us,
and the road does get lonely.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.827
So just seems logical

09:19.893 --> 09:21.629
that we would
pretend to be girls.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.496
That doesn't sound
logical to me.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.698
Look, we're both straight.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.433
We're just two
straight guys kissing,

09:26.499 --> 09:28.035
thinking about girls.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.469
How about this?

09:29.536 --> 09:31.705
How about you go find a girl?

09:31.772 --> 09:35.008
Dude, we live in an RV.

09:35.075 --> 09:38.345
We eat leftovers out
of hotel hallways.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.180
(laughing)

09:40.247 --> 09:42.650
That's... I mean, there aren't
going to be any girls.

09:42.716 --> 09:45.786
(laughing):
Girls.

09:46.854 --> 09:48.789
BURT:
That was when I realized

09:48.856 --> 09:50.691
that while this had been
a nice vacation,

09:50.758 --> 09:53.794
it wasn't the life for me.

09:53.861 --> 09:56.229
As much as I loved
the freedom and the fun...

09:57.965 --> 10:00.634
...I missed my girl.

10:00.701 --> 10:03.303
Burt! You're alive.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.808
You're not yelling.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.877
Why are you
not yelling?

10:09.943 --> 10:11.444
Yeah, Mom. Yell at him.

10:11.511 --> 10:12.545
Or hit him.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.981
Or spit at me!

10:14.047 --> 10:15.683
Isn't that the way you like
to handle things, Jimmy?

10:15.749 --> 10:17.117
I was four!

10:17.184 --> 10:19.319
I cannot believe
that you abandoned me.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.521
You know, maybe... maybe that's
what scarred me for life.

10:21.588 --> 10:23.290
Maybe that's why
I never left home.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.993
Because, deep down, I knew
I had to be there for Mom.

10:26.059 --> 10:29.496
Thanks, Jimmy,
but you're free to go anytime.

10:29.562 --> 10:31.264
You're really
not mad.

10:31.331 --> 10:35.703
No, I'm...
I'm actually relieved.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.204
Well, I guess
I can see that.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.506
You've probably been holding
onto a lot of fear and trauma

10:39.572 --> 10:42.042
from me being kidnapped, and
now you can let all that go.

10:42.109 --> 10:45.645
No, I...
I'm relieved because...

10:45.713 --> 10:47.848
now I can tell you my secret.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.582
(ringtone playing)
Oh!

10:49.649 --> 10:51.084
Sorry. Sorry.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.886
That's probably Wyatt
with the name of the restaurant.

10:54.321 --> 10:55.956
Nope. It's just my mom.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.825
(Sabrina chuckling)

10:57.891 --> 11:00.127
Oh, sorry.
You had a secret.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.439
What do you mean
you have a secret, too?

11:12.505 --> 11:14.341
Okay, don't be mad.

11:14.407 --> 11:15.408
Here's the thing...

11:15.475 --> 11:18.378
When you got kidnapped,
I was a mess.

11:18.445 --> 11:21.314
So, Burt seemed like
a fairly simple guy.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.917
I don't suppose he
had any enemies?

11:23.984 --> 11:27.554
He, he could go on some pretty
angry rants about cable TV.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.156
(sniffles)

11:29.222 --> 11:31.725
You don't think it could be
a cable worker, do you?

11:31.792 --> 11:33.961
I don't know. But obviously,
we're dealing with

11:34.027 --> 11:36.163
an armed and
dangerous criminal.

11:36.229 --> 11:38.966
So, it's probably best that
I guard the house overnight.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.567
Damn right you will.

11:40.633 --> 11:42.602
Oh, and if you need any pajamas,

11:42.669 --> 11:44.271
you can borrow Burt's.

11:44.337 --> 11:45.773
Or, or Jimmy's.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.507
We'll figure out something.

11:47.574 --> 11:48.776
VIRGINIA: For two weeks,

11:48.842 --> 11:50.443
I clung to the hope

11:50.510 --> 11:53.814
that you would somehow get away
or at least find a way to call.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.749
(sobbing)

11:55.816 --> 11:58.185
Hey. Just got an update.

11:58.251 --> 11:59.820
There's no sign
of Burt anywhere.

11:59.887 --> 12:02.923
(sobs loudly)

12:02.990 --> 12:06.359
VIRGINIA:
But as each day passed by,

12:06.426 --> 12:09.429
Ross pointed out that the odds
of me ever seeing you again

12:09.496 --> 12:11.598
got smaller and smaller.

12:11.664 --> 12:14.835
And eventually I started
to get used to the fact

12:14.902 --> 12:16.904
that you weren't coming back.

12:21.674 --> 12:23.911
After a couple of weeks,

12:23.977 --> 12:26.947
you not being here
became our new normal.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.055
Is this jelly on here?

12:35.122 --> 12:36.523
Why didn't you use
the maple syrup?

12:37.724 --> 12:40.227
Oh, top shelf?

12:40.293 --> 12:42.195
Yeah, top shelf.

12:44.064 --> 12:46.666
You need to face facts:

12:46.733 --> 12:48.068
that deadbeat husband of yours

12:48.135 --> 12:49.436
is never coming back.

12:49.502 --> 12:51.138
And you need a man.

12:51.204 --> 12:54.207
That Ross isn't going to keep
trying forever to win you over.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.910
As soon as that police
department needs someone

12:56.977 --> 13:00.480
to crawl through a small
opening, he'll be gone.

13:04.217 --> 13:06.153
I'm willing to
climb for you.

13:10.057 --> 13:12.425
VIRGINIA:
Maybe it was time to move on.

13:15.162 --> 13:17.464
And the more I paid
attention, the more I saw

13:17.530 --> 13:19.332
how different things
were with Ross here.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.869
We were nicer,
more cooperative.

13:21.935 --> 13:24.004
Like poor white Cosbys.

13:28.008 --> 13:31.278
And I never realized
how sexy it was,

13:31.344 --> 13:34.114
living with a man who leaves
more milk in the carton

13:34.181 --> 13:36.884
than on his shirt.

13:36.950 --> 13:39.619
Plus it was nice not having to
worry about a splash landing

13:39.686 --> 13:41.554
every time I used the toilet.

13:44.724 --> 13:47.427
I could even see some pluses
to sleeping with a guy

13:47.494 --> 13:50.163
who took up less room on the
bed than a cocker spaniel.

13:53.901 --> 13:56.069
Oh. Hi.

13:56.136 --> 13:58.705
Sorry, Virginia.
Thought I heard a noise.

13:58.771 --> 14:01.074
Came in to check, and I guess
I must've fallen asleep.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.844
VIRGINIA:
And it wasn't just me.

14:04.912 --> 14:06.779
Jimmy was way more relaxed.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.749
He got along better with Ross
than he ever did with Burt.

14:09.816 --> 14:11.051
And the tiny knight?

14:11.118 --> 14:12.986
He saved the queen
and the young prince,

14:13.053 --> 14:15.222
and swept them away
to live with him

14:15.288 --> 14:17.557
in his three-bedroom,
end-unit castle,

14:17.624 --> 14:20.427
with below-ground parking!

14:20.493 --> 14:23.596
And there, they drank
unlimited fizzy pop,

14:23.663 --> 14:27.935
and played ping-pong
happily ever after.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.603
The end.

14:30.670 --> 14:32.605
Good night.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.313
I give up.

14:40.380 --> 14:44.151
The three sweetest words
in the English language.

14:48.555 --> 14:51.524
You and your mom are going
to love living with me.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.193
Ping-pong!

14:53.260 --> 14:55.128
That was just
elaboration for the story,

14:55.195 --> 14:57.264
but I do have
some fizzy pop.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.799
I have some suitcases
you could use.

14:59.866 --> 15:01.668
I'll go grab them.
Oh!

15:03.370 --> 15:06.106
I'm going to make you the
happiest woman on Earth.

15:15.615 --> 15:16.950
Burt!

15:17.017 --> 15:18.218
You're alive!

15:18.285 --> 15:21.388
Well, you know about my
never say die attitude.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.556
Well... yeah...

15:23.623 --> 15:24.891
That's basically it.

15:24.958 --> 15:26.826
I'll fill in the rest later.

15:26.893 --> 15:28.495
I need a shower.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.564
Hey, little fella,
what are you doing here?

15:31.631 --> 15:34.134
Oh, um... Ross has just
been staying here

15:34.201 --> 15:35.902
in case the kidnappers called.

15:35.969 --> 15:37.137
Oh...

15:37.204 --> 15:39.806
Well, you can leave now.

15:39.872 --> 15:41.674
Thanks.

15:44.211 --> 15:46.279
You're not really going to
stay with that loser, are you?

15:47.947 --> 15:49.816
V-Virginia, come on, please.

15:49.882 --> 15:52.152
I'll cook, I'll clean,
I'll put the toilet seat down.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.720
I'm a great role
model for your son.

15:56.223 --> 15:58.891
You're just so short.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.329
I can't believe while I was
possibly being kidnapped

16:02.395 --> 16:03.863
and possibly being forced
into white slavery,

16:03.930 --> 16:06.099
you were playing house
with the guy in health class

16:06.166 --> 16:07.667
who threw up watching
You and Your Fluids.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.069
That puker

16:09.136 --> 16:10.570
stepped up and took
care of your family

16:10.637 --> 16:13.906
while you were out swapping
spit with a drifter.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.942
It was a closed-mouth kiss.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.377
No spit was swapped.

16:17.444 --> 16:18.345
Yours is worse.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.448
Excuse me.

16:21.514 --> 16:24.084
Why do you people keep
hitting me in the head?

16:24.151 --> 16:26.319
I'm sorry, that
was my fault.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.021
It's kind of
my go-to thing.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.256
Here, put this on it.

16:31.924 --> 16:33.726
I guess I probably deserve it.

16:33.793 --> 16:37.297
Every time I go past the
world's largest confessional,

16:37.364 --> 16:40.933
I try to clear my conscience,
but I just can't shake

16:41.000 --> 16:43.036
the awful thing
I did to your family.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.038
What awful thing?

16:45.105 --> 16:47.707
Well, I promised your old lady
that I'd never tell, but

16:47.774 --> 16:51.078
I figure after 20 years she's
long been dead, so...

16:51.144 --> 16:52.379
What old lady?

16:52.445 --> 16:54.547
I think her name was, uh...

16:58.785 --> 17:03.090
That hippie talks too damn much.

17:11.564 --> 17:14.234
I ain't telling.
You can't make me.

17:14.301 --> 17:16.169
BURT:
Make you?

17:16.236 --> 17:18.105
You were already in
the middle of telling us.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.641
I was?

17:21.708 --> 17:22.675
Oh.

17:22.742 --> 17:23.943
Okay, then.

17:24.010 --> 17:26.179
Where was I?

17:26.246 --> 17:27.880
The beginning.

17:27.947 --> 17:29.549
Of course.

17:29.616 --> 17:30.750
Uh...

17:30.817 --> 17:32.952
I never liked Burt very much.

17:33.019 --> 17:35.955
MAW MAW:
And since it was painfully
clear that Virginia and her kid

17:36.022 --> 17:38.858
weren't going anywhere,
I had to at least try to

17:38.925 --> 17:41.828
get Burt out of the picture.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.797
So I did whatever I could
to cause a little friction.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.280
(groans)

18:10.757 --> 18:12.459
Burt! God!

18:12.525 --> 18:15.695
Your stupid leg
is on my leg! (groans)

18:18.931 --> 18:20.900
(grunts)
Oh, my...

18:20.967 --> 18:23.303
MAW MAW:
I even got the kid
hopped up on sugar

18:23.370 --> 18:25.605
so he'd be a hyperactive
pain in the ass.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.308
(screams)

18:28.375 --> 18:30.377
But no matter what I did,

18:30.443 --> 18:32.879
I couldn't separate
Mr. and Mrs. Freeloader.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.848
So I came up with
my master plan.

18:35.915 --> 18:39.252
I hired a drifter to convince
Burt to run away with him.

18:39.319 --> 18:41.254
Luckily, all the man
wanted in return

18:41.321 --> 18:43.356
was to do a little kissing.

18:52.064 --> 18:54.401
MAW MAW:
Then I just had to
make sure that Burt

18:54.467 --> 18:56.436
would want to
run away that day.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.905
So I siphoned the gas
out of the tank...

18:58.971 --> 19:00.773
which was disgusting,

19:00.840 --> 19:03.510
but did get the taste of
drifter out of my mouth.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.014
And I gave Jimmy as much sugar

19:08.080 --> 19:10.617
as his tiny little
heart could handle.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.753
I knew by the time
you met up with Jack

19:13.820 --> 19:16.456
you'd be ready to rip
each other's throats out.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.591
Then Burt here
threw me a curveball

19:18.658 --> 19:20.527
by faking the whole
kidnapping thing.

19:20.593 --> 19:25.232
I saw an opportunity when
Officer Wyatt Twerp showed up.

19:25.298 --> 19:28.034
I trained Ross to know how
to keep Virginia happier

19:28.100 --> 19:29.636
than she was with Burt.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.710
MAW MAW:
I even cut all
Jimmy's sugar out

19:37.777 --> 19:41.414
so he'd seem
calmer around Ross.

19:41.481 --> 19:43.115
It was all going great...

19:43.182 --> 19:45.685
until Burt came back.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.089
If you weren't 85
and I wasn't afraid

19:50.156 --> 19:52.292
you'd win the fight,
I'd take a swing at you.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.727
Burt, don't. She'll win.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.229
I can't believe you tried
to break up Mom and Dad.

19:56.296 --> 19:58.265
I never stopped.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.199
I smear my lipstick
on Burt's collar.

20:00.267 --> 20:04.036
I've been writing Virginia's
name on bathroom walls

20:04.103 --> 20:05.272
so random guys will call.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.975
I'm the one who never flushes.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.177
I told you I was framed.

20:11.244 --> 20:12.645
SABRINA:
Wow.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.381
She's been trying to
break you guys up

20:14.447 --> 20:17.016
for 20 years, and
you're still together.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.386
That's amazing.

20:21.454 --> 20:22.955
BURT and VIRGINIA:
It sure is.

20:29.195 --> 20:30.963
Ew.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.765
JIMMY:
Eventually the police
showed up,

20:32.832 --> 20:35.335
but thanks to Jack's kind
nature and mild concussion,

20:35.402 --> 20:37.570
he didn't want to
press charges.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.572
(grunts)

20:42.842 --> 20:44.444
So, you just drive
around in your RV

20:44.511 --> 20:45.612
and do whatever you want?

20:45.678 --> 20:47.347
Yeah, I just got
back from seeing

20:47.414 --> 20:48.648
the world's smallest horse.

20:48.715 --> 20:49.882
I've always wanted
to see that.

20:49.949 --> 20:52.084
There's plenty of
room in the RV.

20:52.151 --> 20:54.854
JIMMY:
Maw Maw tried to
break up Mom and Dad.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.756
But when two people are
meant to be together,

20:56.823 --> 20:59.258
there's nothing you
can do to tear them apart.

20:59.326 --> 21:01.361
(sighing)

21:02.495 --> 21:04.597
(phone beeps)

21:07.500 --> 21:09.602
(phone beeps)

21:14.841 --> 21:16.776
But when two people are
not meant to be together,

21:16.843 --> 21:18.678
it's got to be
a lot easier.

21:18.745 --> 21:20.413
Hey. Did I just
hear my phone?
Um...

21:20.480 --> 21:21.881
I didn't hear anything.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.583
Oh...

21:23.650 --> 21:25.718
I can't believe Wyatt
hasn't texted me yet.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.120
You know what? Screw him.

21:28.187 --> 21:29.356
You want to go get some food?

21:29.422 --> 21:30.990
Sure.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.359
How about Mr. Chow's?

21:32.425 --> 21:35.962
Uh... I was thinking Italian.

21:36.028 --> 21:37.830
Child: Adios, Amigos.
