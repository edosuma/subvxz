00:20.400 --> 00:23.120
Do you think that is bureaucratic?
Then go to the military.

00:23.240 --> 00:24.960
Or worse, to the
military in wartime.

00:25.080 --> 00:26.680
Tres con carnes for Dr.  Willis.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.200
-Un soy taco for Dr.  Piel.
-Many Thanks.

00:29.360 --> 00:30.840
They're the ones from the movies.

00:31.320 --> 00:32.600
Yes, Jessamine, right?

00:33.200 --> 00:34.880
Charlotte.  Nice to meet you.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.920
No, keep your money, Jessamine.

00:37.520 --> 00:38.960
That's on the house.

00:39.120 --> 00:39.920
Thank you.

00:40.880 --> 00:42.360
A soy taco?
What the heck is that?

00:42.480 --> 00:44.320
It's not uncommon
here in Los Angeles.

00:44.440 --> 00:46.600
This is occupied northern
Mexico, young lady.

00:46.720 --> 00:49.040
I'm not saying we should return

00:49.160 --> 00:50.240
it, but please, a
little more respect.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.440
That's the good thing about fame.

00:52.920 --> 00:53.840
Free tacos.

00:54.280 --> 00:55.480
Elliot, have a taco.

01:02.480 --> 01:03.800
What the hell?

01:07.120 --> 01:09.600
Dr.  Piel, get a back
support and stretcher.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.120
An edition?  For real?

01:14.240 --> 01:15.720
You know the pathology report.

01:16.080 --> 01:17.600
You can Dr.  Don't
blame Piel for that.

01:18.160 --> 01:19.120
The leg has been destroyed.

01:19.280 --> 01:22.320
How that will sound in court.

01:24.480 --> 01:28.080
"Charlotte Piel, ex-film star,
now a doctor, breaks rules

01:28.240 --> 01:29.600
and a boy lost his leg. "

01:30.080 --> 01:31.760
How does that sound to you?

01:32.200 --> 01:33.680
We are a teaching hospital.

01:33.840 --> 01:35.640
You don't come to us as experts.

01:36.080 --> 01:37.800
If we destroy your self-esteem

01:37.920 --> 01:39.400
now, what are you left with?

01:39.960 --> 01:42.160
My problem is when
we let them treat the sick

01:42.360 --> 01:44.680
before it was checked, and
then something happened.

01:46.160 --> 01:49.600
Charlotte Piel is now
tied to a senior physician.

01:55.120 --> 01:56.400
What do you have there?

01:56.520 --> 01:57.520
A car pulled up
and threw them out.

01:57.640 --> 01:58.920
She delivered her gang here.
Do you need help?

02:00.200 --> 02:01.640
Do you speak Spanish?

02:02.400 --> 02:03.360
-Daddy.
-Yes?

02:03.560 --> 02:05.000
There's an emergency
in the boiler room.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.960
-How so?  What's happening?
-No idea.

02:07.080 --> 02:07.800
I am sending Savetti and Piel?

02:07.920 --> 02:09.000
Send Savetti and Kean.

02:09.120 --> 02:09.960
Understood.

02:10.840 --> 02:13.360
Suborbital fracture.  Take over.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.560
Your ribs are broken.

02:15.680 --> 02:17.840
We'll X-ray the chest and do a
CT scan of the chest and abdomen.

02:22.160 --> 02:24.320
Okay Dr.  Dixon.  To not be shy.

02:24.480 --> 02:26.440
Cut open the clothes.

02:27.800 --> 02:29.840
Dr.  Piel, a FAST
sonography, please.

02:29.960 --> 02:31.560
- Fuck off, you bitch.
-I have heard that.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.480
I'm good.  I want to leave!

02:33.600 --> 02:34.640
Dr.  Piel, where is the
ultrasound machine?

02:34.760 --> 02:35.960
I'm trying to get through...

02:36.120 --> 02:38.200
If you don't come to the
patient, you have a problem.

02:38.320 --> 02:39.920
Push your way through!

02:40.040 --> 02:42.800
No bullets, just broken
bones and bruises.

02:43.760 --> 02:45.200
Anita had her gang
entrance test today.

02:45.400 --> 02:46.600
Anita, which gang are you in?

02:46.720 --> 02:48.720
Big Hazard?  Opal Street?  Which?

02:48.880 --> 02:49.960
No blood to be seen.

02:50.080 --> 02:51.520
Wait is that what i'm thinking

02:51.640 --> 02:53.920
Yes, fetal heartbeat
at 140, strong.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.520
Hey, your baby is fine.

02:55.680 --> 02:57.080
Infant?  What kind of baby

02:57.240 --> 02:58.440
Old woman i'm not pregnant!

02:58.560 --> 02:59.520
Let go of me

03:00.760 --> 03:01.800
Let's go.

03:01.920 --> 03:02.760
I want to get out of here.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.520
You don't know what
you are talking about.

03:04.760 --> 03:05.920
He's over here.  Hurry up.

03:06.040 --> 03:07.480
We worked on the old boiler.

03:07.720 --> 03:09.000
It's as old as the hospital.

03:09.120 --> 03:11.240
When the back pressure was released...
Here.

03:11.920 --> 03:13.080
that switched off the generator,

03:13.200 --> 03:15.320
the fuse, and old Barry too.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.560
Barry can you hear me

03:17.920 --> 03:19.320
Is he alive?

03:21.640 --> 03:22.960
I see him.

03:23.280 --> 03:24.840
One of us has to get in there.

03:25.160 --> 03:26.440
I'm too big

03:28.200 --> 03:29.880
Are you still there?

03:39.880 --> 03:41.440
Hey Barry, I'm Dr.  Savetti.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.080
Can you describe
your injuries to me?

03:43.200 --> 03:44.520
There's a lot of blood here.

03:45.320 --> 03:46.560
Oh what is this for?

03:46.680 --> 03:47.640
So you slide in.

03:47.760 --> 03:49.000
No, you have to wait
for the fire department.

03:49.120 --> 03:50.120
They'll be there
in a minute or two.

03:50.240 --> 03:52.160
In our world, one minute makes
the difference between life and death.

03:52.640 --> 03:55.080
I can squeeze in, but
only without a medical kit.

03:55.680 --> 03:56.920
STOP BLEEDING

03:57.040 --> 03:59.040
Tie the bag to your leg.
You will also need thread.

04:03.280 --> 04:04.240
Fine

04:04.440 --> 04:05.880
That's a terrible idea.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.600
The kettle seems
to agree with you.

04:44.040 --> 04:45.000
Barry?

04:46.200 --> 04:47.160
I am dr  Kean.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.400
Are you a doctor?
They look like 12.

04:52.040 --> 04:53.880
Wound five centimeters
deep in the left middle arm.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.240
Pulsating bleeding.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.920
I apply pressure,
but there is bleeding.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.640
It's arterial.  He needs
an aft seam, close it.

04:59.760 --> 05:00.760
There's too much blood here.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.240
First put the pressure bandage.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.600
I have a better idea.

05:03.720 --> 05:04.880
Why don't you get me out?

05:16.360 --> 05:17.320
The pressure bandage works!

05:17.440 --> 05:18.800
I see the ruptured artery.

05:18.920 --> 05:21.160
Good, but it can't
stay that way for long.

05:21.320 --> 05:22.440
Sew the wound shut.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.000
First just interrupted

05:26.200 --> 05:27.720
then you sew diagonally,

05:28.280 --> 05:29.480
then you tighten it.

05:34.280 --> 05:35.480
My hand is shaking.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.400
Press your tongue against
the roof of your mouth.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.360
That will calm you down.

05:39.480 --> 05:40.440
For real?

05:41.800 --> 05:42.760
For real?

05:50.160 --> 05:51.120
I did it.

05:51.240 --> 05:52.200
The bleeding has stopped.

05:52.320 --> 05:53.280
Okay good.

05:53.560 --> 05:55.080
Now come back, it's not safe.

05:57.480 --> 05:59.080
Noa, get out of there!

06:01.160 --> 06:02.200
Better go now.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.520
I am not leaving him behind.

06:09.240 --> 06:11.280
Hello i'm dr  Willis.
What's your name?

06:16.920 --> 06:18.040
I dont know.

06:18.760 --> 06:20.880
-Have you eaten today?
-I do not think so.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.920
It says here you were picked
up while wandering around.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.240
You know what?

06:25.680 --> 06:27.000
I'll call you Jane.

06:27.280 --> 06:28.240
Is that okay with you

06:28.600 --> 06:30.040
I guess it doesn't matter.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.120
Janie.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.000
I'll try Janie.

06:33.240 --> 06:34.920
You are malnourished
and dehydrated.

06:35.040 --> 06:36.320
Do we want to
make you well again?

06:36.440 --> 06:37.520
That's not what I'm here for.

06:37.640 --> 06:38.600
Why then?

06:38.720 --> 06:40.840
I have to do something
before I can move on.

06:41.600 --> 06:42.960
Move on?
Where do you want to go?

06:43.200 --> 06:44.600
In the next world.

06:44.760 --> 06:45.560
Yes.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.640
The rents are great there.

06:48.160 --> 06:51.040
Before you go, what do

06:51.200 --> 06:52.720
you think about hydration?

06:53.040 --> 06:54.120
That won't help.

06:54.440 --> 06:56.320
-Why do you say that?
-Because I'm dead, Ethan.

07:07.440 --> 07:09.760
- Did you talk to the dead lady?
-Yes.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.200
Lucky one.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.240
I have a therapist
for you there.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.600
They say that like
I've won something.

07:14.840 --> 07:17.800
Dr.  Willis, this is
Dr.  Amanda Nolan.

07:18.280 --> 07:19.760
I am your profit.

07:20.280 --> 07:21.520
Lovely.

07:21.720 --> 07:23.280
Wait... what?

07:23.560 --> 07:25.840
I think he did that
when he was mad at me.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.240
But things have changed.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.040
I'm confused.

07:29.360 --> 07:32.360
Mike has a living will?

07:32.520 --> 07:33.360
He never told me that.

07:33.480 --> 07:34.240
Yes, Angus.

07:34.360 --> 07:35.320
As I mentioned earlier...

07:35.440 --> 07:36.440
And am I his agent?

07:36.560 --> 07:37.520
Do not worry.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.840
My lawyers are working
to make me responsible.

07:42.520 --> 07:43.800
That will just happen.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.560
I was stuck this way too.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.040
I was once cave diving.

07:56.360 --> 07:58.280
How did you escape?

07:58.560 --> 08:00.760
I just always kicked
towards the light.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.000
You say I should seriously
approach the light?

08:03.160 --> 08:04.400
I tell you to keep pedaling.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.840
Is he under there?

08:07.760 --> 08:10.320
When the kettle is raised and stable,
it has to go to the operating room.

08:10.560 --> 08:11.960
Your doctor should
get out of there now.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.280
It looks like your
baby is healthy.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.720
Do you want to know the gender?

08:23.240 --> 08:24.840
How are you feeling, Miss Anita?

08:25.080 --> 08:27.080
The two idiots get on my nerves.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.600
We have, mijita.

08:30.720 --> 08:31.680
When will i get out of here?

08:31.800 --> 08:33.679
I said it already.
We have to watch your baby

08:33.919 --> 08:35.240
and you have a concussion.

08:35.520 --> 08:37.200
Maybe because of the
concussion I don't know.

08:37.400 --> 08:38.600
Have you ever thought of that?

08:38.799 --> 08:40.240
You could be right there.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.800
Don't be naughty
to my doctors, Anita.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.560
Do you see this abnormality?

08:47.720 --> 08:49.360
A small amount of
blood near the placenta.

08:49.520 --> 08:51.240
Maybe that's
because of the beating.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.560
I said there was no beating.

08:52.720 --> 08:53.760
I'll call the gyn again.

08:53.880 --> 08:55.120
Do you want to
see the ultrasound?

08:55.760 --> 08:57.080
No, man.

08:59.320 --> 09:00.800
They are not making it
easy for us to help you.

09:00.920 --> 09:02.280
I don't wanna see

09:02.400 --> 09:04.360
I don't want
anything to do with it.

09:06.240 --> 09:08.200
Let's go.

09:08.440 --> 09:10.400
35 weeks pregnant.

09:10.520 --> 09:12.760
How can she not notice
that she is about to give birth?

09:12.920 --> 09:14.560
Do you know how often women come

09:14.720 --> 09:16.640
here not knowing
they are pregnant?

09:17.160 --> 09:19.920
It happens all the time.

09:20.320 --> 09:23.000
-Do you know how you died?
-No.

09:23.160 --> 09:25.280
Do you remember
anything from your life?

09:25.560 --> 09:26.520
When you were still alive?

09:26.640 --> 09:28.680
See, I'm not really here.

09:28.840 --> 09:30.200
Who am I talking to then?

09:30.840 --> 09:32.360
Maybe this body is borrowed.

09:32.600 --> 09:33.840
So that I can come back.

09:36.120 --> 09:38.000
You see me for a reason.
You are important.

09:38.920 --> 09:41.560
I just don't know why yet.

09:41.720 --> 09:42.840
The dead do not speak.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.920
You don't move.
You don't breathe.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.200
And you do all of that.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.160
Does that make sense to you?

09:50.360 --> 09:52.200
None of this makes sense.

09:54.200 --> 09:55.880
Except that I'm dead.

10:01.440 --> 10:03.240
This is called Cotard Syndrome.

10:03.480 --> 10:05.520
One denies one's own existence.

10:05.640 --> 10:08.600
The patient, absurdly,
thinks she is dead.

10:08.720 --> 10:10.880
They don't realize
the obvious diagnosis.

10:11.320 --> 10:12.280
She is a ghost.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.040
Then she is a ghost with
depression or psychosis.

10:16.600 --> 10:17.800
Can we get them admitted?

10:18.120 --> 10:19.080
She drinks liquid.

10:19.240 --> 10:20.400
They give her infusions.

10:20.560 --> 10:23.720
It is not a risk to
yourself or to others.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.040
I can't fire her like this.

10:25.280 --> 10:27.880
Cotard has been associated

10:28.000 --> 10:29.360
with lesions on
the parietal lobe.

10:29.520 --> 10:31.000
Brain atrophy.

10:31.160 --> 10:34.520
One case was cured
with hemodialysis.

10:34.760 --> 10:37.800
So your condition can be
physical and not mental?

10:37.960 --> 10:40.840
You could keep you here

10:41.120 --> 10:42.720
while you rule that out.

10:42.880 --> 10:45.600
You are a schemer, Dr.  Nolan.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.360
Intrigues are a
tradition in my family.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.280
What do you have to do?

10:56.680 --> 10:58.240
Finish writing down
others' medical records.

10:58.480 --> 11:00.880
Come along.  I have a
child with cold symptoms.

11:01.720 --> 11:04.400
I think I mustn't...

11:04.520 --> 11:07.320
This is a child with a cold.
It doesn't have any major injuries.

11:11.520 --> 11:13.000
The neck looks red.

11:13.280 --> 11:15.160
Certainly a mild upper
respiratory infection.

11:15.360 --> 11:16.480
The lungs are free.

11:16.600 --> 11:17.560
No i know my son

11:17.680 --> 11:18.640
That's not normal.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.120
He has extreme stomach pain.

11:22.920 --> 11:23.880
I'm sorry.

11:24.040 --> 11:25.000
Did that hurt a lot?

11:25.120 --> 11:26.080
That’s okay.

11:26.480 --> 11:29.160
Dad will you get me a pen

11:29.520 --> 11:30.480
Why do you need a pen

11:30.960 --> 11:32.480
Can you sign my belly?

11:33.640 --> 11:34.800
Don't hold it against me, but

11:34.920 --> 11:36.080
do you know what you're doing?

11:36.200 --> 11:38.280
Dr.  Piel is an
excellent doctor.

11:39.760 --> 11:43.040
A sensitive upper abdomen is
atypical for respiratory infections.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.080
Something doesn't fit together.

11:45.480 --> 11:48.400
We need a complete blood
count, cultures, and a CT.

11:48.560 --> 11:50.040
Or you look at his eyes.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.600
His eyes?  What do his
eyes have to do with it?

11:54.360 --> 11:56.160
The dermis is light yellow.

11:56.360 --> 11:58.400
So a liver function
test, a lipase test

11:58.800 --> 11:59.760
and an ultrasound.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.960
Am I just seeing
Dr.  Piel in a patient?

12:04.160 --> 12:05.880
She is not alone.  Dr.
Pineda is with her.

12:06.040 --> 12:07.360
She is not a senior physician.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.560
-I wasn't clear enough.
-Is that really necessary?

12:09.840 --> 12:11.400
Dr.  Piel works
under conditions.

12:11.560 --> 12:12.680
She does not treat patients

12:12.840 --> 12:14.040
without a senior doctor.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.720
If you speak spanish

12:29.520 --> 12:31.160
do you sound like mi abuela.

12:31.480 --> 12:32.880
Oh Jesse...

12:34.000 --> 12:37.600
She's old, confused, and says
things that don't make sense.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.560
Hey, take a bite on it.

12:39.920 --> 12:42.720
That way you won't bite your
tongue off when I hit you in the face.

12:44.880 --> 12:46.320
No no...

12:48.320 --> 12:49.360
I'm fine okay

12:49.520 --> 12:51.160
My friends will pick me up.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.600
There is nowhere to go.

12:52.720 --> 12:54.000
I don't have to stay here.

12:54.120 --> 12:55.680
But you don't have to go either.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.240
I'm fine, just let me.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.400
Anita...

12:59.560 --> 13:00.640
-Get a stretcher.
-OK.

13:00.760 --> 13:02.280
Let's take them to the
Center Stage.  Now.

13:02.400 --> 13:03.680
The air sacs are ready.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.760
All hands back.  And off.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.520
When the air sacs lift
the debris, we stabilize

13:08.640 --> 13:10.960
Barry and take him
to the operating room.

13:14.520 --> 13:15.800
Stop!  That hurts.

13:16.000 --> 13:16.960
Stop.

13:17.120 --> 13:18.320
-The blood pressure is dropping.
-Stop!

13:18.520 --> 13:20.320
-Stop.
- Put it down.

13:24.520 --> 13:25.720
The blood pressure rises again.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.160
He must have internal bleeding.

13:27.320 --> 13:28.640
The weight maintains
the pressure.

13:28.760 --> 13:30.400
So we can't free
him from the weight?

13:30.520 --> 13:31.360
No.

13:32.280 --> 13:33.560
That keeps him alive.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.320
It's okay.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.120
We need a senior
doctor down here.  Now.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.000
The baby's pulse slows down.

13:47.760 --> 13:48.720
What do we have here?

13:48.960 --> 13:49.920
A placenta detachment.

13:50.160 --> 13:51.640
We have to get
the baby right now.

13:51.760 --> 13:52.720
I need gloves.

13:52.880 --> 13:53.840
She's still bleeding.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.280
I'll open... Watch out, your hand.

13:55.400 --> 13:56.360
... the uterus now.

13:56.480 --> 13:57.440
Retractor, please.

13:57.560 --> 13:58.920
Stop, stop, stop.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.000
The idea is

14:00.200 --> 14:02.880
lift it up and run it
under the bladder,

14:03.080 --> 14:04.920
-and to expose the uterus.
-Yes, sir.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.640
-Now it will open.
- Keep vacuuming.

14:07.360 --> 14:11.000
Please, please.

14:11.320 --> 14:12.520
Well, and on.

14:12.680 --> 14:15.800
So, Dr.  Leighton,
disconnect the umbilical cord.

14:16.600 --> 14:18.320
Come on.

14:18.720 --> 14:19.960
Here.

14:20.600 --> 14:21.880
Well, vacuum it up, please.

14:22.520 --> 14:24.520
Come on.

14:24.640 --> 14:25.840
OK.

14:26.080 --> 14:27.360
The baby is in cyanosis.

14:27.480 --> 14:28.440
Come on baby.

14:28.560 --> 14:29.520
Come on baby.

14:29.640 --> 14:30.600
Come over.

14:32.480 --> 14:33.920
Stimulate them.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.000
Come on, little girl,
come on.  Talk to me.

14:38.120 --> 14:39.080
Okay good.

14:39.240 --> 14:40.200
Folks, come here please.

14:40.360 --> 14:41.320
We have to refocus.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.480
We have to remove the
placenta before it bleeds to death.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.120
Welcome to Angel's.

14:46.240 --> 14:47.920
There are too many splinters of ribs.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.360
Noa, further up.
And to the side.

14:51.880 --> 14:53.320
Too far.  More in the middle.

14:53.520 --> 14:55.160
Rotate the probe 90 degrees.

14:55.480 --> 14:58.360
And now move
it down a little...

14:58.720 --> 14:59.680
There.

15:00.360 --> 15:01.320
Holy...

15:01.520 --> 15:03.120
I'll call upstairs and have
the operating room ready.

15:03.240 --> 15:04.560
He's not going anywhere.

15:04.880 --> 15:06.000
What?  Is it that bad?

15:06.120 --> 15:07.080
Dr.  Willis?

15:07.200 --> 15:10.120
Okay, Barry.  A piece of
metal has perforated your heart.

15:10.240 --> 15:13.120
The good news is, the
pressure of the mountain

15:13.240 --> 15:14.760
of metal keeps your heart
from bleeding to death.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.400
But if you lift it...

15:16.760 --> 15:17.960
This is the bad news.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.400
So I'm going to bleed to death.

15:20.560 --> 15:22.240
Oh my God.
I'm going to die right?

15:22.440 --> 15:23.880
You are looking for a solution.

15:24.160 --> 15:25.120
What did you say

15:25.320 --> 15:27.080
- Just keep breathing.
-I'm trying to do that.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.520
-I'll try it.
- Just breathe.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.840
This is how you
both earn your spurs.

15:32.240 --> 15:33.600
What would you do?

15:33.720 --> 15:35.240
If we can't get him
to the operating

15:35.360 --> 15:36.280
room, we'll open him up here.

15:36.400 --> 15:39.040
Campbell won't let
you operate here.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.560
Even if we pull it
out, it'll bleed to death.

15:41.680 --> 15:43.120
-Call Campbell.
-Try to breathe.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.680
Breathe with me.

15:45.440 --> 15:46.640
Oh no.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.360
There are no spurs
for either of you.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.320
His heart is torn.
We have to replace it.

15:54.560 --> 15:55.520
Replace it?

15:55.640 --> 15:56.600
Via ECMO.

15:57.280 --> 15:59.800
A heart-lung bypass
in the boiler room?

15:59.920 --> 16:01.400
He has a large
tear in the ventricle.

16:01.560 --> 16:02.520
If we move it, it will die.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.000
If we can bridge
the heart injury, we

16:04.160 --> 16:05.360
can take him to
the operating room.

16:05.480 --> 16:06.800
He cannot bleed to
death without blood.

16:06.920 --> 16:08.640
That would be a
groundbreaking use for ECMO.

16:08.840 --> 16:10.080
I can do that.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.000
The ECMO is a precision
surgical instrument.

16:12.160 --> 16:13.800
You can't just roll
this through the clinic.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.360
Is this about mobility?

16:15.520 --> 16:18.680
You are talking about an operation
in a free, unsterile environment,

16:19.000 --> 16:20.960
in a patient who has a hole
in the heart that demands

16:21.120 --> 16:23.560
a miracle even under
the best of circumstances.

16:23.720 --> 16:25.000
So we should just give it up?

16:25.160 --> 16:28.000
Your solution is not a solution.

16:28.240 --> 16:30.720
Do whatever is necessary so
that he does not have to suffer.

16:31.040 --> 16:32.440
They are needed in the operating room.

16:33.840 --> 16:35.440
Dr.  Willis.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.560
-You fired Janie?
-No I did not.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.440
Hey  Campbell.

16:41.640 --> 16:42.680
You don't have to do this...

16:42.840 --> 16:44.280
But.

16:44.720 --> 16:47.320
Did you discharge one of
my patients without asking?

16:47.440 --> 16:48.760
Jane Doe, PEM with
the Psychiatry Inquiry?

16:48.880 --> 16:50.000
We needed the bed.

16:50.200 --> 16:51.360
Her laboratory values ​​were normal.

16:51.480 --> 16:52.920
Do you even want
to treat anyone here?

16:55.400 --> 16:57.080
We don't keep
the mentally ill until

16:57.200 --> 16:58.840
we've found something
suitable for them.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.480
Or because they
are "interesting".

17:09.560 --> 17:12.000
His blood pressure is 60 over 30.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.640
That can not be.
Check it again.

17:13.760 --> 17:14.640
Oh god baby

17:14.760 --> 17:16.079
What's happening?

17:16.240 --> 17:17.680
How long has he been like this?

17:17.800 --> 17:18.960
Please step back.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.040
I am his mom.

17:20.920 --> 17:22.599
-Where are the values?
-They are not there yet.

17:22.720 --> 17:24.319
His blood pressure
is still 60 to 30.

17:24.560 --> 17:26.800
Nutrient solution at 20ccs per

17:26.920 --> 17:28.119
kg of saline, insert an access.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.440
No, please do that.

17:29.720 --> 17:30.680
I do that.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.080
Dr.  Piel, go please.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.000
Now.  Step back.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.920
Dr.  Pineda, please insert the
central venous catheter now.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.440
Dr.  Dixon, this is Julio.

17:44.640 --> 17:45.680
Anita's brother.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.120
Thank you for being there.

17:47.280 --> 17:48.240
Is she OK?

17:48.360 --> 17:50.160
We're going to extub them now.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.880
She should fully recover.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.560
You say they threw
her out of the car?

17:54.720 --> 17:56.840
Today she took an
entrance exam for a gang.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.880
She didn't know
she was pregnant.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.840
When she wakes up
she will be a mother.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.440
I haven't seen her in ten years.

18:05.400 --> 18:06.760
She was still in elementary school.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.440
She is my half sister.
It's complicated.

18:10.560 --> 18:11.960
It was messy.

18:15.440 --> 18:16.400
It still is.

18:21.120 --> 18:22.560
I'm so cold.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.920
You'll be an icicle
when we're done.

18:25.120 --> 18:27.560
Cooling your body protects
your organs during surgery.

18:27.760 --> 18:29.920
I think all the time that's it.

18:30.240 --> 18:31.960
And what happens then.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.200
I am very scared.
I do not wanna die.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.840
Can we call someone

18:38.080 --> 18:39.040
Your wife?

18:39.760 --> 18:41.000
She is dead.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.320
A drunk driver, hit and run.

18:44.320 --> 18:45.400
I'm sorry.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.920
She was on her way
home from ballet class.

18:51.080 --> 18:53.560
Her dream was to
become a ballet dancer.

18:54.960 --> 18:56.400
She had the figure for it.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.120
I always called her
my little ballerina.

18:59.320 --> 19:01.320
She must have been graceful.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.840
No, she had two left feet.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.600
She danced really badly.

19:09.760 --> 19:12.160
She was all I had.

19:16.160 --> 19:18.200
How many hours did
it take you to call me?

19:18.320 --> 19:20.000
I would like to know that.

19:22.440 --> 19:24.360
What's going on here?
How is Zane?

19:24.520 --> 19:26.560
His condition is serious.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.240
He has liver failure.

19:28.440 --> 19:30.160
-Oh my God.
-From where?

19:30.360 --> 19:33.040
His blood values
​​show toxic levels of

19:33.160 --> 19:34.480
paracetamol, which
indicate an overdose.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.240
An overdose.

19:36.960 --> 19:37.920
What have you done?

19:38.160 --> 19:39.520
-It was not me.
-What have you done?

19:39.680 --> 19:41.280
Shawna, please wait.

19:41.520 --> 19:43.960
Mr. Jacobson, you said
you gave him cough syrup.

19:44.120 --> 19:45.080
How much?

19:45.360 --> 19:46.320
I do not know.

19:46.480 --> 19:48.240
What was on the bottle.
Maybe a little more.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.960
A bit more?
Did you hear what she said

19:50.120 --> 19:52.720
-You gave him too much medicine!
-No, it wasn't me.

19:52.840 --> 19:55.840
Wait until the judge hears
that, you'll never see him again.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.280
Okay, stop it.

19:57.760 --> 20:00.400
We need to focus on Zane now.

20:00.680 --> 20:03.080
I know that sounds bad now

20:03.360 --> 20:05.280
but he'll need a new liver.

20:08.280 --> 20:09.920
We're taking him to
the intensive care unit.

20:10.080 --> 20:12.240
We put him on the
national donor list.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.320
What?  Are you
saying he might die?

20:14.440 --> 20:16.320
Without a new liver, yes.

20:17.480 --> 20:20.480
You were that!  You
did this to our son!

20:20.600 --> 20:22.040
-No I did not.
-But.

20:22.200 --> 20:23.640
I will never forgive you for that.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.080
You did this to our son.

20:25.240 --> 20:26.520
I didn't...

20:30.600 --> 20:31.960
What's this?

20:32.200 --> 20:34.240
I have the solution
to our ECMO problem.

20:34.520 --> 20:36.720
The Department of Defense
has portable prototypes.  Perfect.

20:36.920 --> 20:38.320
Prototypes?

20:38.640 --> 20:39.720
That is, untested.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.480
This was used to
successfully transport

20:41.600 --> 20:42.920
patients who
were in dire straits.

20:43.080 --> 20:44.840
This is exactly what
it was developed for.

20:44.960 --> 20:47.400
But we have not been
authorized to use it here.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.080
If you don't want
to do the surgery,

20:49.200 --> 20:50.840
I'll do it myself. I
have the authority.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.000
That's not what it is about.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.520
We do the initial assessment.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.760
People live and die through
our resource management.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.400
Two people died in
the emergency room,

20:58.600 --> 21:00.720
when you and the interns
tried to save a dead man.

21:00.960 --> 21:01.920
He is still alive...

21:02.120 --> 21:04.440
The man was dead the
moment the thing fell on him.

21:04.960 --> 21:06.360
Dr.  Dixon, go.

21:09.640 --> 21:10.600
Janie?

21:11.840 --> 21:12.800
You now her?

21:14.280 --> 21:15.240
This is my patient.

21:16.640 --> 21:18.120
One.  Two.  Three.

21:19.560 --> 21:20.800
A car ran over a pedestrian.

21:20.920 --> 21:22.160
Hit and run a few blocks away.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.360
She has injuries to her forehead

21:23.480 --> 21:25.280
and right wrist, GCS is 15.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.760
We weren't done, Dr.  Willis.

21:26.880 --> 21:29.480
Systolic blood
pressure is at 126.

21:29.880 --> 21:30.920
Saturation is normal.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.000
All right  Let's turn them over.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.160
Ready?

21:33.400 --> 21:34.840
Two three.

21:37.320 --> 21:38.960
She has a four inch head injury.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.240
Dr.  Dixon, rinse and clamp.

21:41.520 --> 21:43.000
Dr.  Rorish can do that.

21:44.280 --> 21:45.240
Are you all right Janie?

21:45.520 --> 21:46.480
I told you yes.

21:46.600 --> 21:47.680
You are not dead.

21:47.880 --> 21:50.240
Do you feel pain
where I'm pushing?

21:52.960 --> 21:54.800
-Janie.
-I don't feel anything.

21:54.960 --> 21:56.520
Possible wrist fracture
on the right side.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.120
The lower extremities
are atraumatic.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.560
Dr.  Willis, step away.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.960
I am treating a patient who
was not allowed to discharge.

22:05.680 --> 22:07.520
A therapist assessed
them and released them.

22:07.640 --> 22:08.600
And yet we are here now.

22:09.440 --> 22:10.800
Let's prepare
them for a head CT.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.360
She has no blood in her stomach.

22:12.680 --> 22:13.640
You're doing great, Janie.

22:13.840 --> 22:15.120
It's okay, Ethan.

22:16.480 --> 22:17.720
Are you going.

22:17.880 --> 22:19.280
Help the living.

22:19.480 --> 22:21.680
I know what to do now.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.720
And I think you know that too.

22:26.880 --> 22:28.080
Dr.  Willis,

22:28.720 --> 22:29.680
we can manage here.

22:35.960 --> 22:38.160
You are a guest in my house.

22:38.360 --> 22:39.640
Always remember.

22:41.080 --> 22:42.760
I found a way to give
the man a chance.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.000
Isn't that why we're here?

22:46.760 --> 22:48.400
To face death?

22:49.440 --> 22:50.920
Prepare for the operation.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.400
Put it in, please.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.840
I have to do
something about him.

22:54.960 --> 22:57.520
Don't you like Willis,
or that he's right?

22:59.600 --> 23:01.400
Probably both.

23:11.840 --> 23:13.320
How's mike

23:13.480 --> 23:15.480
I may be his agent.

23:15.680 --> 23:16.640
That makes sense.

23:16.760 --> 23:17.720
Oh yes?

23:17.920 --> 23:19.440
You have no right to be here.

23:19.640 --> 23:20.960
How do you even know I'm here?

23:22.040 --> 23:23.240
You have a baby now.
That’s the only thing that matters.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.400
You are responsible for them.

23:24.560 --> 23:25.960
If it is that important
to you, take it!

23:26.080 --> 23:27.200
You can't ignore this...

23:27.320 --> 23:28.920
You ran away  But I survived.

23:29.160 --> 23:30.120
You are no better than me

23:30.360 --> 23:31.320
You are a bastard.

23:31.440 --> 23:32.600
I didn't run away.  I was lucky.

23:32.880 --> 23:33.840
And you can escape too.

23:33.960 --> 23:35.600
I don't want to escape.
I am where I want to be

23:36.320 --> 23:37.280
Just go.

23:37.400 --> 23:38.360
Get out of here!

23:38.480 --> 23:40.000
Get him out!
I don't want him here.

23:40.120 --> 23:41.760
You can't help anyone who
doesn't want to help himself.

23:44.080 --> 23:46.320
You think I'm a monster
because I don't want the baby.

23:46.640 --> 23:48.240
Not me.

23:50.200 --> 23:52.320
I got into the care
system when I was two.

23:55.640 --> 23:57.280
I never knew my real parents.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.080
Do you hate them because
they gave up on you?

24:02.920 --> 24:04.200
No.

24:05.520 --> 24:07.480
And now look at you, doctor.

24:09.400 --> 24:10.760
Maybe she'll be a doctor too.

24:14.520 --> 24:16.200
Or a nurse.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.320
Nurses are cool.

24:21.560 --> 24:22.920
Do you want to see them?

24:23.320 --> 24:24.960
Why should i

24:26.680 --> 24:27.840
To say goodbye.

24:41.400 --> 24:44.280
I can't live with
it if it's my fault.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.200
It was a terrible accident.

24:52.960 --> 24:54.480
I am his dad.

24:56.520 --> 24:59.800
I should be the
one to protect him.

25:01.920 --> 25:03.520
Now he might die because of me.

25:03.640 --> 25:06.280
Blaming himself
will not help him.

25:09.400 --> 25:10.680
Give him my liver.

25:12.360 --> 25:13.920
Put me on the list.

25:14.880 --> 25:17.000
You don't have to.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.480
You can donate part.

25:18.760 --> 25:20.240
The liver regenerates itself.

25:20.640 --> 25:22.000
There's no guarantee it'll fit

25:22.200 --> 25:24.800
but we can do tests.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.040
I applied to the
Griffith Observatory

25:30.240 --> 25:32.080
-on a moonlit night that...
-Do you hear that?

25:32.200 --> 25:34.840
Couldn't you take
me out to dinner

25:35.000 --> 25:35.920
and to the observatory
like a normal guy?

25:36.040 --> 25:37.840
Can I...
have a little more privacy?

25:38.040 --> 25:39.080
Can you get it off?

25:39.240 --> 25:41.040
How did you even
get it up there?

25:41.160 --> 25:42.440
I wanted something...

25:42.560 --> 25:43.800
Not.  Don't answer.

25:43.920 --> 25:44.880
Idiot.

25:45.480 --> 25:46.960
We once had a ring mill here.

25:47.160 --> 25:50.320
How should I tell my family
this engagement story?

25:50.440 --> 25:51.560
It would work with a cast saw.

25:51.680 --> 25:52.600
Resourceful.

25:52.880 --> 25:55.680
No, an engagement
ring around the penis is

25:55.800 --> 25:56.760
imaginative, and then
to make the proposal.

25:57.560 --> 25:59.080
We have to take it off.
It really hurts.

25:59.280 --> 26:01.440
You should have thought
about that beforehand.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.200
We'll remove the
ring for you and

26:04.320 --> 26:05.920
put it where it
belongs.  Do not worry.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.240
I suppose she didn't say yes.

26:10.360 --> 26:11.520
Yes.

26:18.560 --> 26:19.680
I want to be there.

26:19.800 --> 26:22.520
At the ECMO-OP.
We can publish that.

26:33.720 --> 26:35.200
Where is my dad?

26:36.600 --> 26:37.560
Hey...

26:38.560 --> 26:39.920
He's out in the lobby.

26:40.120 --> 26:41.280
And see, your mom is right here.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.760
Did you fight?

26:45.000 --> 26:46.920
They argue all the time.

26:47.280 --> 26:49.560
You think I don't hear that.

26:49.880 --> 26:52.520
They just want you to be better.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.520
I didn't want her to
be mad at him for me.

26:59.600 --> 27:02.840
I asked him for more syrup.

27:03.960 --> 27:05.640
More syrup?

27:05.800 --> 27:07.400
Do you mean the cough syrup?

27:07.560 --> 27:08.840
The grape stuff.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.160
He didn't want to give me any more.

27:11.400 --> 27:12.840
Zane,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.040
did you drink more
of the medicine?

27:17.280 --> 27:18.760
I've drunk everything.

27:18.920 --> 27:20.920
I wanted to get better faster.

27:21.120 --> 27:23.360
I didn't want them to argue.

27:27.320 --> 27:28.600
Zane.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.960
Please don't be mad at Dad.

27:32.200 --> 27:34.040
I just got sick.

27:34.560 --> 27:36.360
It is not his fault.

27:53.920 --> 27:55.960
It's the coolest procedure
you'll ever do here.

27:56.160 --> 27:57.440
And I'm worried about Barry.

27:58.560 --> 27:59.680
The patient?

28:02.720 --> 28:04.720
As?  Are you going
to pump the blood

28:04.880 --> 28:05.840
out of my body and
put it in a machine?

28:06.040 --> 28:07.280
That will keep you alive.

28:07.400 --> 28:08.600
OK?  We have to stun you now.

28:08.720 --> 28:09.960
Please i am not ready.

28:10.240 --> 28:11.400
You won't feel anything.
Promised.

28:11.520 --> 28:12.480
So that's it?

28:12.800 --> 28:14.600
I am drugged  And maybe
don't wake up anymore?

28:14.720 --> 28:16.040
We take care that
this doesn't happen.

28:16.360 --> 28:17.320
I am not ready.

28:17.720 --> 28:19.200
OK?  I'm afraid.

28:19.360 --> 28:20.320
I am very scared.

28:20.440 --> 28:21.720
Tell me more about your wife.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.240
Ready to intubate.

28:26.360 --> 28:28.280
I always called her
my little ballerina.

28:29.760 --> 28:30.720
Barry...

28:34.440 --> 28:35.920
He needs to calm down.

28:36.240 --> 28:38.120
Barry, if your
heart rate goes up

28:38.360 --> 28:40.160
if this increases internal
bleeding, calm down.

28:40.720 --> 28:41.840
Barry!

28:42.640 --> 28:44.520
Barry, calm down
so we can go to work.

28:44.800 --> 28:46.480
I'm so afraid.

28:54.160 --> 28:55.920
We stun you now.

28:59.400 --> 29:00.520
He needs to calm down.

29:00.640 --> 29:02.760
When your pulse rises,
you bleed more internally.

29:02.880 --> 29:03.840
You need to calm down.

29:05.680 --> 29:07.760
Everything will be fine.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.240
Stay

29:16.440 --> 29:17.400
Is it really you?

29:17.520 --> 29:18.760
Yeah, we'll get you out of here.

29:18.880 --> 29:20.000
Etomidate and suxamethonium.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.120
-Janie?
-I'm dying, right?

29:46.040 --> 29:47.640
Five liters have already flowed.

29:47.760 --> 29:48.720
It works.

29:48.880 --> 29:50.200
His heart and lungs are saved.

29:50.320 --> 29:52.120
-That is so cool.
-Yes or?

29:52.240 --> 29:54.040
Dr.  Pinkney.

29:54.280 --> 29:55.240
Thanks for coming.

29:55.400 --> 29:58.200
Do you think I'll let you do
this without a real surgeon?

29:58.960 --> 30:00.200
Come on, let's do it.

30:00.320 --> 30:03.000
We now raise the
kettle very slowly.

30:03.280 --> 30:04.600
Understood.  Lifting.

30:09.680 --> 30:10.920
-Is he outside?
-Not yet.

30:14.640 --> 30:15.680
-OK.
-Good.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.880
One.  Two.  Three.

30:26.640 --> 30:28.360
You are a natural.

30:28.680 --> 30:30.640
I have no idea
what I'm doing here.

30:30.840 --> 30:33.080
I'm just being careful
not to drop them.

30:35.600 --> 30:36.640
She is wonderful.

30:36.880 --> 30:38.560
Yes that's her.

30:41.400 --> 30:42.560
And it's mine.

30:44.440 --> 30:47.000
I will do what is best for you.

30:49.080 --> 30:50.480
She deserves a mom

30:50.760 --> 30:52.320
that never lets you down.

30:58.760 --> 31:00.040
I'm not that mom.

31:01.640 --> 31:03.000
It could be you

31:03.320 --> 31:06.680
You can live with me.
We have room for you both.

31:10.440 --> 31:12.280
She needs a family.

31:12.480 --> 31:13.600
You need a family.

31:13.720 --> 31:14.560
I have a family...

31:14.680 --> 31:16.520
Real family, Anita.

31:17.360 --> 31:18.880
You should believe
that you cannot go.

31:20.200 --> 31:21.680
You don't need it.

31:24.120 --> 31:25.760
But she needs you

31:29.240 --> 31:30.640
Would you do that for her?

31:34.600 --> 31:35.880
I would do it for you.

31:55.280 --> 31:56.240
Okay, separate this.

31:56.400 --> 31:57.520
The heart valve is okay again.

31:57.720 --> 31:58.680
What is the core temperature?

31:58.800 --> 31:59.880
36.1.

32:00.080 --> 32:02.280
Well it's time.

32:02.440 --> 32:03.680
Let's suspend the bypass.

32:11.560 --> 32:13.200
Come on.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.160
He has fibrillation.

32:15.320 --> 32:17.800
Defibrillator paddles, please.

32:18.120 --> 32:20.040
Charge up to 50.

32:21.400 --> 32:22.560
Step away.

32:23.160 --> 32:25.440
Come on, Barry.

32:27.520 --> 32:29.000
-No change.
-Once again.

32:31.000 --> 32:31.960
Step away.

32:43.880 --> 32:44.840
Sinus rhythm!

32:45.200 --> 32:46.280
He lives

32:52.160 --> 32:53.280
Let's close it.

33:19.480 --> 33:21.760
The lab told us
your test results.

33:21.960 --> 33:24.680
It looks like you would
be a suitable donor.

33:28.960 --> 33:30.320
Thank you.

33:30.920 --> 33:32.480
Thank you.

33:36.440 --> 33:39.520
Zane has a tough
road ahead of him.

33:39.680 --> 33:41.640
He'll need you more than ever.

33:42.160 --> 33:43.360
They both.

33:52.120 --> 33:53.080
Hey buddy.

33:53.240 --> 33:55.480
-What?  No no.
-Yes, everything's fine.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.080
-That's for sure.
-This is my penis.

33:57.240 --> 33:58.440
And that's my reputation.

33:58.640 --> 34:00.000
We both have to save our skin.

34:00.160 --> 34:01.280
So to speak.

34:01.400 --> 34:04.560
The ring cost a fortune
and now he's neutering me.

34:04.680 --> 34:06.040
These are your testicles.

34:06.240 --> 34:08.440
Actually, this would
be a penectomy.

34:08.639 --> 34:10.920
He looks like a strangled plum.

34:11.239 --> 34:12.320
Do you find this helpful?

34:12.520 --> 34:14.800
This is my penis.
It's not yours yet.

34:14.960 --> 34:17.120
Good.  We'll do a lap.  Come.

34:17.239 --> 34:18.440
Good.  Chill out.

34:22.639 --> 34:23.840
What's his prognosis?

34:24.080 --> 34:25.040
Forecast?

34:25.360 --> 34:26.520
Is there any permanent damage?

34:26.679 --> 34:28.199
If I invest in him
long term, I need

34:28.320 --> 34:30.760
to know that his
stock won't crash.

34:31.920 --> 34:33.600
He should recover completely.

34:34.360 --> 34:35.320
Good.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.000
Then I'll be engaged right away.

34:37.199 --> 34:39.120
-Mazel tov.
-Many Thanks.

34:48.360 --> 34:49.600
How is the routine work going?

34:51.320 --> 34:52.880
How do I know if I can do this?

34:53.719 --> 34:56.440
We have internal
battles every day.

34:57.040 --> 35:01.280
On the one hand fear,
guilt, remorse, the bad things.

35:02.040 --> 35:06.520
On the other hand, the good
things, hope, humility, faith.

35:06.640 --> 35:08.200
Do you know which side wins?

35:10.280 --> 35:12.080
The ones that are fed.

35:15.600 --> 35:16.760
Do you smell cookies?

35:17.400 --> 35:18.880
I smell cookies.

35:23.920 --> 35:26.160
Hey congratulations.

35:26.320 --> 35:27.840
I heard the tech made it.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.320
It was amazing.

35:29.440 --> 35:30.680
This ECMO prototype
was the size of a laptop.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.120
I've never seen
anything like it.

35:33.480 --> 35:34.440
Did you want to see me?

35:35.120 --> 35:36.080
You saved the man

35:37.120 --> 35:38.080
and shown that I was wrong.

35:39.800 --> 35:41.000
It wasn't about that.

35:41.120 --> 35:43.080
I know.  It was about you.

35:43.720 --> 35:46.440
They could do the
procedure and work a miracle.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.320
I am withdrawing your
operating theater rights.

35:52.160 --> 35:54.280
You make rounds,
can be consulted,

35:54.400 --> 35:55.480
but you are leaving
the trauma team.

35:55.600 --> 35:57.360
-I beg your pardon?
-You are out.

36:07.720 --> 36:08.680
Do you have a problem with that?

36:08.800 --> 36:10.880
No, if you don't trust her,
the collaboration won't work.

36:11.280 --> 36:12.240
I agree.

36:12.400 --> 36:13.360
But your way...

36:14.320 --> 36:16.600
Your style may be
appropriate in surgery

36:16.800 --> 36:19.320
but it's disturbing down here.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.040
We have to be able
to work together.

36:26.480 --> 36:28.120
I have no problem
working with you.

36:28.560 --> 36:29.920
Good.

36:30.120 --> 36:31.080
Then trust me.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.160
I know how to run this place.

36:33.400 --> 36:34.560
I know that.

36:34.800 --> 36:37.280
But I was hired to do better.

36:37.600 --> 36:38.920
And I will.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.440
Anything else?

36:44.360 --> 36:46.600
You can get pretty humble here.

36:47.800 --> 36:49.080
That will do you good.

36:54.320 --> 36:56.000
You did a great job down there.

36:56.280 --> 36:57.240
Thank you.

36:57.640 --> 36:59.480
But I was only there

36:59.600 --> 37:00.680
because you didn't pass.

37:01.280 --> 37:02.560
Do you call me fat

37:02.680 --> 37:03.640
If the girdle would have fit...

37:04.840 --> 37:06.960
Barry would never
have made it without you.

37:07.160 --> 37:08.800
I would never have
made it without you.

37:10.080 --> 37:11.280
I don't flirt.

37:16.360 --> 37:17.520
What, did you not see her?

37:17.880 --> 37:20.120
I sent her up for a
head CT hours ago.

37:20.480 --> 37:22.440
No, not necessary.
I spoke to security.

37:22.680 --> 37:23.640
What's happening?

37:23.840 --> 37:26.440
My hit and run patient
has disappeared... again.

37:27.280 --> 37:29.520
The ones you saw wandering
around the boiler room?

37:30.120 --> 37:31.400
Yes, the "dead one".

37:31.920 --> 37:35.440
Cotard Syndrome.
She thinks she is dead.

37:35.640 --> 37:38.960
Barry's wife.  She
died from a drunk driver.

37:39.120 --> 37:40.440
Hit and run.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.880
If you sign this,
the authorization

38:08.000 --> 38:10.880
will be transferred to me.

38:16.680 --> 38:18.000
Angus?

38:35.920 --> 38:37.400
Why do you think I can't do it?

38:37.800 --> 38:39.360
Because you can't.

38:39.640 --> 38:42.040
When it gets difficult, you
always look for a way out.

38:42.640 --> 38:45.040
He chose me, dad.

38:45.520 --> 38:48.360
He thought of just
such a situation

38:48.800 --> 38:51.040
and he chose me instead of you.

38:52.640 --> 38:53.880
Angus, please.

38:54.960 --> 38:56.120
Just sign the paper.

39:01.040 --> 39:02.000
That's typical again.

39:02.200 --> 39:03.640
I'm not running away from it.

39:03.760 --> 39:05.680
The choices
that this entails...

39:05.840 --> 39:08.120
Mike was with me when
I went through rehab.

39:08.400 --> 39:12.720
Only he was with me
in my darkest times.

39:13.800 --> 39:15.680
I won't let him down if
he goes through this.

39:17.160 --> 39:18.400
Angus...

39:27.880 --> 39:30.240
I heard from the boiler room.

39:30.520 --> 39:32.240
You saved the man.

39:34.360 --> 39:36.720
And don't worry about Janie.

39:36.840 --> 39:38.400
If I had a dime for
every patient who...

39:38.520 --> 39:40.160
No i'm fine

39:40.760 --> 39:43.400
I am good at my job.

39:43.840 --> 39:47.000
Even if not, I know
something is going on here.

39:47.240 --> 39:49.120
Why did you take
care of her so much?

39:54.640 --> 39:56.280
Because I was dead once too.
