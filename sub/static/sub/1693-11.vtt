WEBVTT

00:00.652 --> 00:02.118
I wanted to serve my country.

00:02.151 --> 00:03.751
You know who dies for
their country, kid?

00:03.775 --> 00:04.817
Rubes, that's who.

00:04.851 --> 00:06.085
You know why he enlisted?

00:06.120 --> 00:07.680
'Cause he couldn't
hack it at Princeton.

00:07.704 --> 00:09.304
Jumped through hoops
to get him in there.

00:09.328 --> 00:11.138
He runs away, joins the army?

00:11.172 --> 00:14.442
- Accept Jesus as your savior!
- (Coughs, splashes)

00:14.477 --> 00:16.349
Woman: Oh Jesus.

00:17.685 --> 00:20.490
It's heroin. You can
sniff it or inject it.

00:20.524 --> 00:22.962
Get a few samples
out to the locals.

00:22.996 --> 00:24.864
How about getting this
out to the locals?

00:24.898 --> 00:27.235
- Van Alden: When did this come?
- Yesterday.

00:27.270 --> 00:29.374
I am to receive all
correspondence

00:29.408 --> 00:30.875
from Mrs. Van Alden immediately.

00:30.910 --> 00:32.610
(Abigail cries)

00:32.645 --> 00:36.417
Spinal polio. The paralysis
will most likely be permanent.

00:36.451 --> 00:38.455
- What do we do now?
- Measure Emily for braces

00:38.489 --> 00:41.594
- and hope for the best.
- Are you looking for a miracle?

00:41.629 --> 00:43.497
- I am.
- What is this?

00:43.531 --> 00:45.733
A donation. I want
to be free of it.

00:45.767 --> 00:48.472
It's a weight on me, father...
on my soul.

00:48.507 --> 00:51.810
- Why'd you marry me, Jimmy?
- Because I love you.

00:51.844 --> 00:53.812
But it isn't true.

00:53.847 --> 00:55.716
What can you tell us
about a Hans Schroeder?

00:55.750 --> 00:59.421
In your file it says that Nucky
Thompson ordered Schroeder murdered.

00:59.456 --> 01:01.524
I have no doubt whatsoever.

01:01.558 --> 01:02.892
Let's bring him in.

01:02.927 --> 01:04.662
At my house you come arrest me?

01:04.697 --> 01:08.668
My professional courtesies don't
extend to murder suspects.

01:08.702 --> 01:10.404
This alcohol needs to be sold.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.574
- Where?
- I propose

01:12.608 --> 01:15.577
we split up and sell it
in our respective towns.

01:15.611 --> 01:17.280
- This is my town!
- Philly then.

01:17.315 --> 01:19.916
I wouldn't go there if I was you.
On account of Manny Horvitz?

01:19.951 --> 01:22.587
Jimmy: You take Philly.
I'll head north.

01:22.622 --> 01:24.857
(Muffled scream)

01:27.427 --> 01:29.995
- Where's Darmody?
- He isn't here.

01:30.030 --> 01:32.131
Your husband did this to you.

01:33.366 --> 01:34.700
(Sighs)

01:40.639 --> 01:43.341
(Theme music playing)

01:45.000 --> 01:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:17.445 --> 03:20.380
Jimmy.

03:20.415 --> 03:22.783
Jimmy?

03:23.885 --> 03:27.087
- Jimmy, I have to leave.
- Hmm?

03:28.490 --> 03:31.392
I'm sorry.

03:34.597 --> 03:37.299
Was I dreaming?

03:37.333 --> 03:40.269
We're in Princeton.

03:41.805 --> 03:44.240
Don't go.

03:47.178 --> 03:50.013
I'm supposed to work breakfast.

03:52.217 --> 03:54.753
Let 'em starve.

03:58.157 --> 04:00.360
Uhh.

04:07.935 --> 04:10.303
I drew you.

04:11.472 --> 04:14.174
Is that really what
my ear looks like?

04:15.943 --> 04:18.644
- Woman: Hello, Calvin. How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

04:18.678 --> 04:21.081
- Woman: I'm good.
- Mrs. Krakauer.

04:26.888 --> 04:28.955
Oh...

04:28.990 --> 04:31.458
My mother's coming
in this afternoon.

04:32.794 --> 04:34.428
She "needs" to see me.

04:34.462 --> 04:37.731
- I'll keep out of your hair.
- No no, you should meet her.

04:38.966 --> 04:40.600
You think it's a good idea?

04:40.634 --> 04:42.202
Yeah, she'll love you.

04:42.236 --> 04:44.671
(Knocks)

04:46.540 --> 04:48.441
- Jimmy: Cal.
- You owe me your life.

04:48.475 --> 04:51.077
Krakauer was up here snooping.

04:51.111 --> 04:53.312
She heard something. I
said it was just me

04:53.347 --> 04:55.481
reciting Robert
service to myself.

04:55.515 --> 04:57.850
It makes me sad 'cause
you actually do.

05:02.888 --> 05:05.556
Next time we go back to
using your car. Please?

05:05.590 --> 05:08.558
Well, the thing is,
that wasn't my car.

05:08.593 --> 05:11.161
It's the second
door on the left.

05:11.195 --> 05:12.429
I hate you.

05:12.464 --> 05:13.764
Hey, one more thing.

05:17.402 --> 05:19.670
- I'll see you tonight?
- Maybe.

05:19.704 --> 05:21.271
Maybe?

05:23.874 --> 05:25.975
How come you and not me?

05:28.847 --> 05:30.548
Fallon: As cookies go,

05:30.582 --> 05:32.984
this Esther Randolph's
strictly vinegar.

05:33.018 --> 05:34.819
And the judge?

05:34.853 --> 05:37.021
I was giving the signals.

05:37.056 --> 05:39.391
- He wasn't responding.
- Signal harder.

05:39.426 --> 05:41.427
Any harder he'll
nail me for bribery.

05:41.461 --> 05:43.495
Then we'll both
need new lawyers.

05:44.932 --> 05:47.567
Randolph's betting big
on the capital case.

05:47.601 --> 05:50.536
She wants you in the noose
for Hans Schroeder.

05:50.571 --> 05:53.205
And the deputy... Halloran?

05:53.240 --> 05:55.840
He'll say you gave the order
and they let him walk.

05:55.875 --> 05:58.109
- What about Eli?
- Not talking.

05:58.144 --> 06:00.678
- To the feds?
- To us.

06:00.712 --> 06:03.247
And just so you
know, I'm innocent.

06:03.281 --> 06:05.449
I wouldn't have taken
your case otherwise.

06:05.483 --> 06:09.420
- What else?
- They're putting the prohi on the stand.

06:09.454 --> 06:11.622
Van Alden? The man's a bigamist.

06:11.657 --> 06:14.625
No, he's an adulterer, with a
child by your former mistress.

06:14.659 --> 06:16.527
Let's not have the jury
even start wondering

06:16.561 --> 06:18.162
whose ox is being gored there.

06:18.196 --> 06:21.299
But he is a treasury agent. And
depending on your leanings...

06:21.333 --> 06:23.701
You need to dust under
my eyelids, Harlan?

06:23.735 --> 06:26.871
- No sir, Mr. Thompson.
- Then that's all for now.

06:30.375 --> 06:32.010
How bad is this?

06:32.044 --> 06:34.312
I'm not a naysayer,

06:34.347 --> 06:36.448
but a prudent man

06:36.482 --> 06:38.584
might want to get his
finances in order.

06:40.754 --> 06:42.622
Make it a scotch.

06:49.263 --> 06:51.097
Was I not clear?

06:51.131 --> 06:53.199
Yes sir.

06:54.768 --> 06:56.502
Then what?

07:02.442 --> 07:05.177
You kept me working
these past weeks.

07:05.211 --> 07:08.080
- With the strike and all...
- You don't need to thank me.

07:08.114 --> 07:09.914
No sir.

07:09.949 --> 07:12.818
But I belong to the
Shiloh baptist church...

07:12.852 --> 07:16.189
I appreciate your prayers.
Now if you don't mind?

07:16.223 --> 07:18.491
Yes sir.

07:21.763 --> 07:23.630
What is it you want to say?

07:26.334 --> 07:29.970
Well, about a year ago

07:30.004 --> 07:32.840
the Deacon held our annual
week of miracles...

07:32.874 --> 07:36.010
Prayers, baptisms and such

07:36.044 --> 07:39.013
for anyone inclined
to accept the savior.

07:39.081 --> 07:43.016
Your agent Van Alden
show up one afternoon

07:43.051 --> 07:46.152
with the other lawman.

07:46.186 --> 07:48.454
And?

07:48.488 --> 07:50.723
He drowned that fella

07:50.757 --> 07:53.024
in front of us all.

07:58.631 --> 08:00.764
Harlan, is it?

08:02.734 --> 08:05.469
- (Humming)
- (Stirring)

08:06.404 --> 08:07.904
Van Alden: Good morning.

08:07.939 --> 08:11.041
Good morning to you.
Breakfast soon.

08:11.075 --> 08:13.410
Abigail is asleep?

08:13.444 --> 08:16.813
Ja ja. Babies always
are sleeping.

08:16.848 --> 08:20.117
- Here is the coffee.
- Thank you.

08:28.793 --> 08:31.561
(Speaks Dutch)

08:33.164 --> 08:37.700
- I don't understand.
- "How are you?" You are Dutch, no?

08:38.835 --> 08:40.436
No.

08:40.470 --> 08:42.236
I'm from upstate New York.

08:42.270 --> 08:44.473
And your mama and papa?

08:44.507 --> 08:46.308
Do you go to them to visit?

08:48.311 --> 08:50.846
They don't enjoy my company.

08:53.015 --> 08:55.451
How can this be?

08:57.654 --> 08:59.889
My parents were followers

08:59.923 --> 09:02.659
of reverend Edgartin Sterry,

09:02.694 --> 09:07.131
who prophesied the
second coming in 1892.

09:07.165 --> 09:09.800
I was not yet even born then.

09:09.835 --> 09:11.502
Hmm.

09:11.536 --> 09:13.904
In anticipation of judgment day,

09:13.939 --> 09:16.007
my father gave away our farm.

09:16.041 --> 09:18.375
We lived in a tent,

09:18.410 --> 09:22.046
penniless, for an entire year

09:22.081 --> 09:24.883
waiting for the lord to return

09:24.917 --> 09:27.918
cloaked in fire and glory.

09:29.588 --> 09:31.456
This did not happen.

09:31.490 --> 09:34.259
My father never got over it.

09:35.595 --> 09:38.863
And somehow the mere fact
of my ongoing existence

09:38.897 --> 09:41.833
is more than he can bear.

09:47.940 --> 09:49.942
He will still come.

09:49.976 --> 09:52.111
Jesus.

09:52.145 --> 09:55.081
Doesn't that worry you?

09:59.887 --> 10:03.891
You are a good man, Mr.
Van Alden.

10:07.562 --> 10:10.397
There's nothing to
be frightened of.

10:25.012 --> 10:26.912
Well, young lady,

10:26.947 --> 10:29.148
would you like to give it a try?

10:29.182 --> 10:31.383
Go on, dear.

10:38.057 --> 10:40.525
How does it feel?

10:40.559 --> 10:42.359
Rubbery.

10:42.394 --> 10:44.261
We're going to let go of you.

10:44.295 --> 10:46.497
But we're right here.

10:48.767 --> 10:51.536
- (Gasps)
- That's a good start.

10:51.570 --> 10:53.705
You were standing straight up.

10:53.739 --> 10:56.975
- Wasn't she, father?
- Right there with the best of them.

10:57.009 --> 10:59.210
Look what I have.

10:59.245 --> 11:02.080
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

11:02.115 --> 11:05.450
I'm going to talk to your
mother for a minute. All right?

11:11.090 --> 11:14.391
She'll need to develop strength
in her arms and torso,

11:14.426 --> 11:18.128
find her balance. Might be
a little rough at first.

11:18.163 --> 11:21.030
She'll be strongly tempted
to go back to crawling.

11:21.065 --> 11:23.499
But we're not gonna let
her do that, are we?

11:23.534 --> 11:25.802
We are not.

11:25.869 --> 11:27.803
She's going to do fine.

11:27.838 --> 11:29.906
I'll get her signed out.

11:29.940 --> 11:32.908
You just have to put your leg
through the hole there...

11:35.245 --> 11:38.481
You held up Emily. The
lord will hold up you.

11:38.515 --> 11:41.885
She needs to learn
to support herself.

11:44.889 --> 11:48.559
A man once was invited to
visit both heaven and hell.

11:48.593 --> 11:51.830
First he went to hell, where
all the tormented souls

11:51.864 --> 11:54.065
were sitting at tables
laden with food,

11:54.099 --> 11:56.134
yet they were starving

11:56.169 --> 11:58.236
and howling with hunger.

11:58.271 --> 12:01.340
Each soul had a spoon, but
the spoons were so long

12:01.374 --> 12:03.676
that they couldn't get
them into their mouths.

12:03.711 --> 12:06.579
Their frustration
was their torment.

12:06.614 --> 12:08.481
And in heaven?

12:08.515 --> 12:10.750
In heaven, to his amazement,

12:10.785 --> 12:12.885
the man found the
souls of the blessed

12:12.920 --> 12:15.622
sitting at similar
tables laden with food,

12:15.656 --> 12:18.090
but they were all
fed and contented.

12:18.125 --> 12:21.594
Each had a spoon and the spoons were
just as long as the spoons in hell,

12:21.628 --> 12:24.496
but they were able to
eat all they needed

12:24.531 --> 12:27.666
because they were
feeding each other.

12:30.536 --> 12:32.805
Your donation was put
toward the construction

12:32.839 --> 12:34.406
of the new parish hall.

12:34.441 --> 12:36.909
I'm glad to hear it.

12:36.944 --> 12:39.112
We have enough for the
walls and the floor.

12:39.147 --> 12:40.948
Now we're praying for a roof.

12:43.151 --> 12:45.452
I cado something more.

12:45.487 --> 12:48.856
That's not what I
was asking for.

12:57.499 --> 13:00.034
Emily: Two cups of milk

13:00.069 --> 13:03.605
with two spoonfuls of sugar.

13:04.874 --> 13:07.174
- Man: Okay, let's go.
- (Gulls cawing)

13:10.045 --> 13:13.580
Okay... And right.

13:17.318 --> 13:19.786
Man: Do you know where
your son was last night?

13:19.820 --> 13:22.955
He was attending
to his business.

13:24.024 --> 13:26.091
Which is?

13:26.126 --> 13:28.927
Why are you here?

13:30.130 --> 13:32.264
It's a double homicide, ma'am.

13:32.298 --> 13:35.200
Why are you here?

13:36.436 --> 13:38.938
I specifically asked
for sheriff Thompson.

13:38.972 --> 13:40.673
The sheriff's unavailable.

13:40.707 --> 13:42.708
Well, you'll need
to talk to him,

13:42.742 --> 13:44.710
instead of hinting
at accusations.

13:44.745 --> 13:46.423
I'm just trying to get
the facts straight.

13:46.447 --> 13:47.857
The facts are these:

13:47.881 --> 13:51.150
My son's wife was being
intimate with another woman.

13:51.184 --> 13:54.018
I highly doubt if it
was the first time.

13:54.053 --> 13:56.420
An intruder broke in,

13:56.455 --> 13:58.222
killed them both.

13:58.257 --> 14:02.226
- Man: All right, we got 'em.
- (Ambulance departs)

14:04.128 --> 14:06.463
You're an associate of Mr.
Darmody's?

14:09.000 --> 14:11.368
Yes.

14:11.402 --> 14:13.670
Do you know his whereabouts?

14:16.220 --> 14:17.220
He... he's...

14:17.244 --> 14:19.611
Can't you see this
man is a simpleton?

14:21.112 --> 14:23.781
He's just someone that
my son is charitable to.

14:23.815 --> 14:26.250
He doesn't know anything.

14:28.020 --> 14:29.788
Do you?

14:29.822 --> 14:31.723
Uh...

14:35.195 --> 14:37.697
We'll let you know when
you can claim the body.

14:40.801 --> 14:43.670
Thank you for your sympathy.

14:51.279 --> 14:53.346
Were you able to reach him?

14:54.782 --> 14:57.383
He wouldn't answer the phone.

14:58.352 --> 15:00.653
Well, he needs to come home.

15:00.687 --> 15:03.755
People will get the wrong idea.

15:05.124 --> 15:07.459
Will you excuse me, please?

15:11.098 --> 15:14.267
(Waves crashing)

15:51.504 --> 15:54.773
Jimmy: "My father prov'd
himself a gentleman",

15:54.807 --> 15:57.843
sold all's land, and,
like a fortunate fellow

15:57.877 --> 16:00.279
died ere the money was spent.

16:00.313 --> 16:02.214
"You brought me up at..."

16:05.418 --> 16:07.553
Padua.

16:07.587 --> 16:10.222
"Padua, where I protest,"

16:10.256 --> 16:12.524
for want of means...

16:12.559 --> 16:15.962
I have been fain to heel
my tutor's stockings,

16:15.996 --> 16:17.797
at least seven years;

16:17.831 --> 16:19.866
conspiring with a beard,

16:19.900 --> 16:21.435
"made me a graduate..."

16:21.469 --> 16:23.136
(Chuckles)

16:25.073 --> 16:27.375
"And shall I, having
a path so open"

16:27.409 --> 16:28.843
to my preferment,

16:28.877 --> 16:31.645
"still retain your milk
in my pale forehead?"

16:31.679 --> 16:33.748
To which his mother replies:

16:33.782 --> 16:35.750
"O that I had never borne thee."

16:35.784 --> 16:38.819
So... nasty little scene.

16:38.853 --> 16:41.121
What's Webster on about here?

16:41.990 --> 16:44.125
Mr. Carruthers?

16:45.995 --> 16:49.130
The way to graduate from college
is to bribe someone, sir.

16:49.165 --> 16:51.199
- (Laughter) - That may
be so in your case.

16:51.233 --> 16:54.535
But think more broadly.
Mr. Lebarron?

16:56.138 --> 16:58.239
It's a corrupt society,

16:58.274 --> 17:02.444
so you can't help but
be corrupt in it?

17:02.511 --> 17:04.746
The jacobeans loved to
depict Italy like this.

17:04.780 --> 17:07.147
Women are bald-faced whores

17:07.183 --> 17:10.117
and men are lustful panderers.
All very entertaining,

17:10.153 --> 17:13.055
but what's the scene about?

17:17.060 --> 17:19.594
His mother taught him things
that aren't of any use.

17:19.628 --> 17:22.864
Everybody around him
is getting rich.

17:24.500 --> 17:27.569
And he can feel it
like he's hungry,

17:27.603 --> 17:30.004
like he can taste it.

17:30.038 --> 17:32.574
Sounds persuasive to me.

17:32.608 --> 17:34.709
Good.

17:34.743 --> 17:37.979
All right, next week "the
revenger's tragedy."

17:38.014 --> 17:41.049
Uh, I can't make class next week, Mr.
Pearson.

17:41.083 --> 17:42.951
S.A.T.C. is out on maneuvers.

17:42.985 --> 17:44.786
Taking your
soldiering seriously.

17:44.821 --> 17:46.321
We're headed for war, aren't we?

17:46.356 --> 17:48.256
He just likes the uniform.

17:48.291 --> 17:49.558
It's called patriotism!

17:49.593 --> 17:51.427
I guess you don't know
anything about that.

17:51.461 --> 17:55.198
- The kaiser never hurt me.
- My brother died on the Lusitania.

17:58.870 --> 18:02.173
- I didn't know that, Tom.
- Then you might apologize.

18:03.409 --> 18:05.009
Sure I do. I...

18:05.044 --> 18:07.412
I'm so sorry.

18:10.149 --> 18:13.151
All right, gentlemen,
we've averted a duel.

18:13.185 --> 18:15.820
"The revenger's tragedy."

18:15.854 --> 18:18.089
Read tourneur.

18:18.123 --> 18:19.790
Mr. Darmody.

18:19.824 --> 18:22.392
Can you stay for a minute?

18:26.297 --> 18:29.766
You won't win that way
with fellas like that.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.202
I know.

18:32.236 --> 18:34.537
That was stupid of me.

18:34.572 --> 18:36.606
Then why did you say it?

18:36.640 --> 18:38.442
Where I come from,

18:38.476 --> 18:41.979
people sorta come out swinging.

18:44.182 --> 18:47.285
- Where is that?
- Atlantic City.

18:48.787 --> 18:51.656
Are you going back there?
After you graduate?

18:54.494 --> 18:56.562
It's what I'm supposed to do.

18:56.597 --> 18:58.264
According to whom?

18:58.299 --> 19:00.500
Mr. Thompson.

19:00.535 --> 19:02.202
He's my... guardian.

19:02.237 --> 19:04.339
- And my mother.
- Princeton man?

19:04.373 --> 19:06.374
Mr. Thompson? No.

19:06.408 --> 19:08.242
But he knows people.

19:08.277 --> 19:10.310
And he's footing the bill here?

19:12.347 --> 19:14.515
As long as I don't screw up.

19:14.549 --> 19:17.284
Is that what you
think you're doing?

19:18.152 --> 19:19.786
I don't know, sir.

19:19.820 --> 19:21.854
Am I?

19:21.889 --> 19:25.024
Sharpe, Lebarron,

19:25.058 --> 19:27.593
they'll do fine

19:27.628 --> 19:28.995
no matter what.

19:29.029 --> 19:31.998
It was all set up for them
the moment they were born.

19:32.032 --> 19:34.301
People like us,

19:34.335 --> 19:35.802
we need to be clever.

19:35.837 --> 19:37.671
Like us?

19:37.706 --> 19:39.707
My father spent 30 years

19:39.742 --> 19:41.943
punching tickets on
the Northern Pacific.

19:41.977 --> 19:44.312
He's proud of me.

19:44.346 --> 19:47.282
Doesn't have a damn
idea what I do.

19:49.852 --> 19:52.186
That's all.

19:52.221 --> 19:54.656
Thank you, Mr. Pearson.

19:57.125 --> 19:59.227
"What! Because we are poor,

19:59.261 --> 20:01.028
shall we be vicious?"

20:03.032 --> 20:04.766
"Pray, what means have you

20:04.800 --> 20:07.434
to keep me from the
galley, or the gallows?"

20:07.469 --> 20:09.837
Webster... Terrific
stuff, isn't it?

20:09.871 --> 20:12.105
I'll see you at the
mixer tonight.

20:12.140 --> 20:15.207
All right. Thank you, sir.

20:17.477 --> 20:19.311
Al: How's it lookin'?

20:19.345 --> 20:20.425
Meyer: We're getting there.

20:21.215 --> 20:22.935
Mickey: Got rid of my
whole share in Philly.

20:22.959 --> 20:25.283
We didn't even have to
go back to New York.

20:25.317 --> 20:27.084
Sold the whole lot in Hoboken.

20:27.118 --> 20:30.054
What do we do with
Jimmy's piece?

20:30.088 --> 20:31.989
Fuck Jimmy.

20:32.024 --> 20:33.024
It's ours now.

20:33.060 --> 20:35.192
He ain't gonna be showing
his mug around here again.

20:35.293 --> 20:38.730
The quiff was my wife, I
woulda done it the same way.

20:38.764 --> 20:41.265
If it was your wife, I
wouldn't blame her.

20:41.300 --> 20:43.467
- He's coming back.
- Seems unlikely.

20:43.501 --> 20:46.236
He didn't ice her.

20:46.270 --> 20:48.438
Then who did?

20:48.472 --> 20:49.906
Manny Horvitz.

20:52.609 --> 20:55.444
Little agitation
between him and Jimmy.

20:57.714 --> 20:59.448
Then it's Jimmy's problem.

20:59.482 --> 21:01.516
Sell this shit and
be done with it.

21:01.550 --> 21:04.285
And when he turns up
lookin' for his dough?

21:04.319 --> 21:07.121
- Pay him out of your share.
- (Luciano chuckles)

21:09.090 --> 21:10.625
My share?

21:10.659 --> 21:12.260
How you figure that?

21:12.294 --> 21:15.530
'Cause you're a mope, that's how.
(Laughs)

21:15.564 --> 21:17.733
And what's left over for me?

21:17.767 --> 21:20.336
- "What's left over for me?"
- Run these numbers.

21:20.370 --> 21:24.074
A.R. holds a half million dollar
policy against your life.

21:24.108 --> 21:26.009
I don't know nothing about that.

21:26.044 --> 21:29.046
I watched you sign it,
you fuckin' snitch.

21:29.080 --> 21:31.215
So how about I put a
slug in your head

21:31.249 --> 21:33.150
and we split the
policy with him?

21:34.018 --> 21:35.820
My share'll be fine.

21:35.854 --> 21:37.621
I thought so.

21:46.197 --> 21:48.765
So they couldn't
bend their arms?

21:48.799 --> 21:51.935
The spoons were too long.

21:51.969 --> 21:53.903
Why couldn't they just

21:53.938 --> 21:55.705
hold them higher
up on the handle?

21:55.739 --> 21:58.708
- You're missing the point!
- I'm trying to understand.

21:58.742 --> 22:01.778
These... these parables,
they make no sense.

22:01.812 --> 22:04.948
You're the man
with all the boats

22:04.982 --> 22:06.950
and the lifeguard popping up.

22:06.984 --> 22:09.687
- It's completely different.
- How?

22:09.721 --> 22:12.056
That story

22:12.090 --> 22:14.259
is about helping yourself

22:14.327 --> 22:16.461
with whatever's
at your disposal.

22:16.496 --> 22:20.032
Do you not believe
in any higher power?

22:20.067 --> 22:22.869
The federal government
comes to mind.

22:27.141 --> 22:30.043
I don't know, okay?

22:30.077 --> 22:33.546
But I do know what I don't believe
in, and that's divine retribution.

22:33.580 --> 22:35.748
What about the evidence?

22:35.783 --> 22:38.584
It's not evidence, Margaret.
It's coincidence.

22:38.618 --> 22:41.954
- Emily: Mommy!
- Yes dear?

22:41.988 --> 22:44.589
I need to go potty.

23:00.704 --> 23:02.604
Holler when you're done.

23:02.639 --> 23:05.507
Thank you, officer.

23:16.253 --> 23:19.523
Well? What do they have?

23:20.725 --> 23:22.960
Deputy Halloran's deposition.

23:22.994 --> 23:25.696
I'd like you to read it,

23:25.731 --> 23:27.565
tell me what you think.

23:27.600 --> 23:30.301
He says I murdered
Hans Schroeder?

23:30.335 --> 23:32.069
Yes.

23:32.104 --> 23:33.638
Then I don't need to read it.

23:33.672 --> 23:35.539
It's a pile of horshit.

23:37.275 --> 23:40.277
- Why would he implicate you?
- Halloran was appointed sheriff...

23:40.311 --> 23:42.278
Temporarily...

23:42.313 --> 23:44.581
While I recuperated
from a gunshot wound.

23:44.615 --> 23:46.382
He wanted it to be permanent.

23:46.417 --> 23:48.585
So he fingers you for a murder.

23:48.619 --> 23:50.587
Plus this riot shit.

23:50.621 --> 23:54.424
He takes a shot from some darkie in
the line of duty and it's my fault?

23:54.458 --> 23:57.260
That was an unfortunate
occurrence.

23:57.295 --> 24:00.897
I had nothing to do with it.

24:03.134 --> 24:06.837
- I'm here to help you, Eli.
- Then get me bail.

24:06.871 --> 24:09.240
You're a flight risk.
They won't even...

24:09.274 --> 24:11.108
Where am I gonna go?

24:11.143 --> 24:13.311
This is my town!

24:16.115 --> 24:18.916
Miss Randolph is positing

24:18.951 --> 24:21.786
that your brother ordered you
to murder Hans Schroeder.

24:21.821 --> 24:24.322
I don't take orders
from anybody.

24:24.357 --> 24:27.325
Eli, if you're
willing to cooperate

24:27.359 --> 24:31.930
and testify that you committed
the murder at Nucky's behest...

24:31.964 --> 24:36.334
Well then, Randolph is
willing to spare your life.

24:38.170 --> 24:39.470
My life?

24:39.505 --> 24:42.273
Meaning she won't argue
for the electric chair.

24:43.810 --> 24:46.378
(Train horn blaring,
crossing bell ringing)

24:48.048 --> 24:49.982
(Laughing, chattering)

24:50.017 --> 24:51.951
- Hey!
- Oh, here he is.

24:51.985 --> 24:53.453
Sorry I'm late.

24:56.924 --> 24:59.192
So what's wrong?

24:59.227 --> 25:02.497
Nothing's wrong. I
wanted to see you.

25:02.531 --> 25:04.265
Can't I do that?

25:04.300 --> 25:06.401
You're changing so much.

25:06.436 --> 25:08.303
- No I'm not.
- You are.

25:08.338 --> 25:11.572
Mrs. Krakauer told me all
sorts of shocking things.

25:11.607 --> 25:13.508
I stopped by your dormitory.

25:13.542 --> 25:15.776
Mrs. Krakauer's just a busybody.

25:15.811 --> 25:18.847
Hmm, phone calls from women
in the middle of the night.

25:18.881 --> 25:20.481
That was you, ma.

25:20.515 --> 25:22.550
Kissing underfed waitresses.

25:22.584 --> 25:23.887
Her name's Angela.

25:24.087 --> 25:26.255
If that's all you're
up to with her.

25:27.656 --> 25:29.490
She also draws.

25:29.524 --> 25:31.458
So does a chimney.

25:33.361 --> 25:34.828
How's Mr. Gunderman?

25:34.862 --> 25:36.395
Henderson.

25:36.430 --> 25:38.330
Arthur Henderson.

25:38.365 --> 25:39.932
How is he?

25:39.966 --> 25:41.933
He's married, dear.

25:41.968 --> 25:44.703
Married and mortgaged in
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

25:44.737 --> 25:47.072
"Sorry, little squirrel.

25:47.106 --> 25:49.608
I thought girls like
you could tell."

25:49.642 --> 25:52.143
He didn't deserve you, ma.

25:52.178 --> 25:54.312
I had my pleasures.

25:54.347 --> 25:56.081
That's all that matters.

26:00.153 --> 26:02.153
Aren't you gonna open that?

26:07.526 --> 26:10.495
(Pours)

26:12.497 --> 26:14.565
You can have one too, you know.

26:14.599 --> 26:16.767
I'm supposed to write an essay.

26:16.801 --> 26:19.536
(Laughs)

26:28.445 --> 26:30.212
Where do you want this?

26:30.246 --> 26:32.048
In the closet, please.

26:32.082 --> 26:35.384
I can't stand the sight
of an unpacked suitcase.

26:35.418 --> 26:38.987
It makes me think
of lonely salesmen

26:39.021 --> 26:41.289
and bromo seltzer.

26:42.625 --> 26:45.160
You know what I was
thinking on the train?

26:46.963 --> 26:49.565
I can't ever get too sad,

26:49.599 --> 26:52.435
because no matter
what, I have you.

26:58.843 --> 27:01.345
I love you, ma.

27:07.619 --> 27:11.254
Now what are we college
kids gonna do for fun?

27:13.490 --> 27:15.058
(Phone ringing)

27:15.092 --> 27:17.059
How does it happen?

27:17.094 --> 27:19.027
She's a widow in a
three-room bungalow.

27:19.062 --> 27:20.996
He's got the entire
eighth floor of the Ritz.

27:21.030 --> 27:23.131
Lathrop: She went after him.
Why not?

27:23.165 --> 27:24.933
Sets her sight on the big ike,

27:24.967 --> 27:26.801
ensnares him with
her feminine...

27:26.835 --> 27:29.037
Don't say "wiles," Clifford.

27:29.071 --> 27:31.639
Abilities.

27:34.744 --> 27:36.645
Your opinion?

27:36.679 --> 27:38.914
Beg your pardon?

27:38.982 --> 27:41.851
You questioned her.
What's your opinion?

27:44.655 --> 27:47.991
She left no impression on
me one way or the other.

27:51.529 --> 27:53.396
Why aren't we bringing her in?

27:53.431 --> 27:56.033
Type it up.

28:00.171 --> 28:02.672
Randolph: Yes, I need the federal
courthouse on Camden, please.

28:02.707 --> 28:04.741
- Clerk's office.
- ♪ three cheers ♪

28:04.775 --> 28:09.412
- ♪ For old Nassau... ♪
- Thank you.

28:09.446 --> 28:11.680
(Chattering)

28:14.818 --> 28:16.452
Angela!

28:17.755 --> 28:19.789
I thought you weren't coming.

28:19.823 --> 28:22.358
I wasn't going to.

28:22.393 --> 28:24.661
What changed your mind?

28:24.695 --> 28:26.663
My aunt wanted me to
clean out the stove

28:26.697 --> 28:29.365
with borax and a wire brush.
How do I look?

28:29.399 --> 28:31.834
Like you're from Bryn Mawr.

28:31.868 --> 28:33.869
For you.

28:36.640 --> 28:38.675
Did your mother go back?

28:38.709 --> 28:40.910
- Actually she's...
- Gillian: How could I,

28:40.945 --> 28:42.945
without meeting you first?

28:42.980 --> 28:45.881
Ma, this is Angela.
Angela this is my mother.

28:45.915 --> 28:47.549
We're going to kiss.

28:47.584 --> 28:49.518
Of course.

28:54.224 --> 28:56.258
Let me drink you in.

28:58.629 --> 29:01.363
Simple, restrained.

29:03.166 --> 29:04.333
I like it.

29:04.367 --> 29:07.869
- What you have on is lovely.
- Oh.

29:07.904 --> 29:10.072
I never know what to wear.

29:11.974 --> 29:15.410
- Corsage, dear.
- Yes.

29:20.115 --> 29:23.116
It's very difficult
to raise a gentleman.

29:25.953 --> 29:28.288
Yeah, come on, you're
gonna love it.

29:34.963 --> 29:37.098
Do you know all these people?

29:37.133 --> 29:39.401
A few.

29:40.537 --> 29:42.872
Over there, they're
all upperclassmen.

29:42.906 --> 29:45.274
They don't even give you the
time of day unless you're

29:45.309 --> 29:46.311
- in the yacht club...

29:46.512 --> 29:48.221
I'm attaching myself
to both of you.

29:48.245 --> 29:50.313
- Do you know why?
- (Laughs) No.

29:50.348 --> 29:53.316
Because I'm full of anxiety
and socially inept.

29:53.351 --> 29:55.519
(Chuckles) Relax.

29:55.553 --> 29:57.120
Get yourself a drink, Cal.

29:57.155 --> 29:59.522
I've already had one.

30:00.691 --> 30:03.127
What's your next
piece of advice?

30:04.796 --> 30:07.730
You just stay with me, then we'll
both have someone to talk to.

30:09.066 --> 30:11.034
- You're my Roxane.
- (Gillian laughing)

30:11.069 --> 30:12.602
That's from "Cyrano."

30:12.637 --> 30:15.506
(Belches) Uh, I worship you.

30:15.540 --> 30:19.310
My father owns a tire
factory in Dayton.

30:19.345 --> 30:22.748
It's unromantic, but
extremely profitable.

30:22.782 --> 30:24.850
I've had more than one drink.

30:24.884 --> 30:27.253
Nobody would notice.

30:44.603 --> 30:45.804
Angela: Jimmy?

30:45.838 --> 30:49.107
- (Gillian laughing)
- Jimmy.

30:49.141 --> 30:51.443
There's something I
need to tell you.

30:51.477 --> 30:53.455
What? What?

30:53.479 --> 30:55.916
There's something I
need to tell you.

30:55.949 --> 30:56.949
What is it?

30:59.119 --> 31:01.787
I should have said it yesterday.

31:01.822 --> 31:05.091
Guess I didn't have the nerve.

31:05.125 --> 31:08.361
- Anyway I wasn't sure.
- Sure about what?

31:10.998 --> 31:12.899
I'm pregnant.

31:21.010 --> 31:23.879
- I'm sorry.
- No.

31:25.081 --> 31:27.316
Um...

31:29.352 --> 31:31.220
We'll get a place.

31:31.254 --> 31:33.555
And, uh.

31:33.589 --> 31:36.091
It'll be swell.

31:37.526 --> 31:40.427
You'll see. We'll...
we'll be together.

31:41.863 --> 31:43.931
Is this a marriage proposal?

31:43.965 --> 31:47.334
Well, it will make
getting a lease easier.

31:51.472 --> 31:54.007
Jimmy, you hardly know me.

31:55.242 --> 31:57.277
I know you're a good person.

32:01.883 --> 32:04.584
(Crickets chirping)

32:06.620 --> 32:09.389
(Music playing)

32:14.362 --> 32:17.131
- They asleep?
- Yes.

32:19.167 --> 32:20.868
Can I pour you a drink?

32:20.903 --> 32:22.637
No thank you.

32:27.410 --> 32:29.311
What's wrong?

32:29.345 --> 32:31.780
You wanted to talk.

32:40.422 --> 32:41.922
I spoke to Fallon.

32:41.957 --> 32:44.625
Eli will testify against me

32:44.659 --> 32:46.927
to save himself the best he can.

32:46.962 --> 32:49.797
What will he say?

32:49.831 --> 32:53.434
Enough to put me in jail if
miss Randolph does her job.

32:54.769 --> 32:56.704
Let's be honest...

32:56.738 --> 32:58.606
Maybe enough to put
me in the chair.

33:03.779 --> 33:06.013
What I have, my money,

33:06.048 --> 33:08.349
can be seized.

33:08.384 --> 33:12.287
But I can hide it, make sure it's
helping the people who matter to me.

33:12.321 --> 33:15.190
Why is that important to you?

33:15.224 --> 33:17.125
How can I talk to you
when you're like this?

33:17.160 --> 33:18.706
It's a sincere question.

33:18.730 --> 33:21.040
You think I don't care
what happens to you?

33:21.064 --> 33:23.799
I think you need to believe

33:23.833 --> 33:26.334
that something good could
come out of all this,

33:26.369 --> 33:31.072
that would save you somehow.
And I wish it could.

33:31.107 --> 33:34.076
What the hell kind of nonsense
is Brennan putting in your head?

33:34.110 --> 33:37.012
They're not his thoughts.
They're mine.

33:41.250 --> 33:44.019
There's roughly 160,000 acres,

33:44.053 --> 33:45.887
most of it held in a company

33:45.922 --> 33:48.323
that Ed Bader's brother
is president of.

33:48.358 --> 33:51.593
But all the voting stock...
Are you listening?

33:51.628 --> 33:53.674
Yes.

33:53.698 --> 33:55.130
The voting stock belongs to me.

33:55.431 --> 33:57.900
I've instructed bill
Fallon to draw up papers

33:57.934 --> 34:01.303
transferring it all into
your name exclusively.

34:01.337 --> 34:05.051
At a future point you can move
it to another corporation...

34:05.075 --> 34:05.084
(Music playing)

34:05.108 --> 34:07.009
Which I'll form
in another state.

34:07.043 --> 34:10.312
We can sell the land at a
profit and use that money to...

34:12.514 --> 34:15.518
(Distant party noises)

34:22.824 --> 34:24.893
You coming back inside?

34:24.928 --> 34:26.661
Just getting some air.

34:26.696 --> 34:28.897
(Huffs)

34:30.065 --> 34:32.434
Ma?

34:40.043 --> 34:42.710
I thought we were just flirting.

34:46.815 --> 34:48.949
(Sighs)

34:51.587 --> 34:54.156
- Hold this.
- What are you doing?

34:59.062 --> 35:01.697
- Mr. Darmody.
- What'd you do to my mother?

35:01.731 --> 35:04.933
- I'm sorry, what?
- My mother... what'd you do to her?

35:04.968 --> 35:07.536
- That was your mother?
- Did you touch her?

35:07.571 --> 35:11.073
- Really? I thought she was...
- You thought she was what?

35:11.107 --> 35:13.776
Let's just say

35:13.810 --> 35:16.178
your life is pretty
jacobean all by itself.

35:16.212 --> 35:18.680
- Get up.
- Don't be an ass.

35:18.714 --> 35:21.916
- You heard me. Get up, Mr. Pearson.
- All right.

35:21.950 --> 35:24.585
All right.

35:24.619 --> 35:28.622
Look. There's no sense
in winding yourself up

35:28.656 --> 35:30.323
to do something stupid.

35:30.357 --> 35:34.395
I will apologize in a convincingly
chivalrous fashion...

35:40.737 --> 35:43.739
Walk away... now.

35:43.774 --> 35:46.810
- I'll pretend this didn't happen.
- It is happening.

35:47.678 --> 35:49.446
(Grunting)

35:55.186 --> 35:56.819
(Knocks)

35:58.788 --> 36:00.655
- (Wings flutter)
- "Mixelslaw"?

36:00.689 --> 36:02.424
Mieczyslaw.

36:02.458 --> 36:04.459
Your note was rather cryptic.

36:04.493 --> 36:06.595
To keep it on the hush.

36:08.430 --> 36:09.964
Sit.

36:09.998 --> 36:11.999
No thank you.

36:13.402 --> 36:15.370
Please.

36:15.404 --> 36:17.639
I don't like the way you loom.

36:24.779 --> 36:27.381
What do you have for
me, mizzleslav?

36:32.820 --> 36:34.922
This particular
situation I'm in,

36:34.956 --> 36:37.825
I gave it my best.

36:37.860 --> 36:40.729
Basically I put the whole
operation together

36:40.797 --> 36:42.498
and what do I get?

36:42.533 --> 36:44.867
A poke up the ass.

36:44.902 --> 36:46.870
Painful.

36:46.904 --> 36:50.140
I'll say. Now we're
gonna sit down...

36:50.174 --> 36:52.909
Me, Capone,

36:52.943 --> 36:55.812
Luciano and the Jew kid.

36:55.847 --> 36:59.415
- We're gonna divvy up the money.
- What about Darmody?

36:59.450 --> 37:02.252
- Did a bunk.
- Where?

37:02.286 --> 37:04.321
Not my concern.

37:04.355 --> 37:07.357
I mean he's lucky I'm a
forgiving person, right?

37:07.391 --> 37:09.326
Considering.

37:11.028 --> 37:13.263
Anyhow...

37:13.297 --> 37:15.498
There's gonna be a lotta
green on the table.

37:15.532 --> 37:18.101
See what I'm saying?

37:19.370 --> 37:22.172
You're suggesting that
federal agents intervene.

37:22.206 --> 37:25.008
I am suggesting that, yes.

37:25.042 --> 37:27.811
For what in return?

37:27.845 --> 37:30.813
Half back this way.

37:30.847 --> 37:33.282
How much are we talking about?

37:34.985 --> 37:37.787
Two... (Soft giggle)

37:37.822 --> 37:40.724
Okay, 300 grand.

37:40.758 --> 37:43.126
150 in your pocket.

37:44.695 --> 37:47.931
A lot better than the envelope
you've been getting, huh?

37:51.702 --> 37:54.304
So?

37:59.944 --> 38:02.312
I'd prefer not to.

38:02.346 --> 38:04.781
Yeah?

38:04.815 --> 38:06.650
What?

38:06.684 --> 38:10.420
- I'd prefer not to.
- Does that mean no?

38:13.223 --> 38:14.335
What does that mean?

38:14.359 --> 38:16.969
Don't contact me again
under any circumstances.

38:16.993 --> 38:18.660
Hey. Hey!

38:18.694 --> 38:20.828
- You're gonna fuck me over?
- (Door slams)

38:20.863 --> 38:24.265
- (Wings flutter)
- 'Cause that's not how I think.

38:26.435 --> 38:28.736
(Laughs) Oh.

38:28.770 --> 38:30.505
Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't.

38:30.539 --> 38:33.575
How much did you drink, ma?

38:33.609 --> 38:36.444
What's in that bottle?

38:42.419 --> 38:44.587
- Mmm.
- (Laughs)

38:48.359 --> 38:50.293
Nothing.

38:50.327 --> 38:52.561
Then a lot, I guess.

38:52.595 --> 38:54.630
Oh, you have blood
on your shirt.

38:54.664 --> 38:56.731
Let me rinse it.

38:56.766 --> 38:58.966
Come on.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.102
- Let me...
- I got it.

39:01.136 --> 39:04.337
(Sighs) How badly
did you hurt him?

39:04.372 --> 39:08.141
- How badly?
- Enough to get me expelled.

39:08.175 --> 39:09.609
No!

39:09.643 --> 39:13.447
No. Nucky'll fix it.
He can fix it.

39:13.482 --> 39:17.285
- You'll see.
- Why did you come here, ma?

39:19.422 --> 39:22.190
Oh baby.

39:23.960 --> 39:26.896
I'm just the loneliest
person on earth.

39:34.338 --> 39:36.371
Do you love that skinny girl?

39:37.240 --> 39:39.407
I don't know.

39:39.441 --> 39:42.309
No.

39:42.344 --> 39:43.811
I don't know.

39:43.845 --> 39:46.446
Then promise me

39:46.481 --> 39:49.182
you won't do anything stupid.

39:49.217 --> 39:52.386
Let's get those shoes off
and get you into bed.

39:52.420 --> 39:54.288
Come on.

39:54.322 --> 39:56.223
That's what I would
say to you...

39:56.257 --> 39:58.593
- Come on.
- When you were little.

39:58.627 --> 40:00.662
Oh, your shirt.

40:00.696 --> 40:03.065
I'll do it later.

40:10.875 --> 40:13.577
- Whoa... Jesus!
- (Giggling)

40:13.611 --> 40:16.146
- Whoops.
- (Crossing bell ringing)

40:18.884 --> 40:21.786
- Arms up.
- Oh, yes sir.

40:24.958 --> 40:27.393
All right.

40:30.264 --> 40:34.500
- Okay. Oh...
- Jesus.

40:35.936 --> 40:38.370
Now into bed.

40:38.405 --> 40:40.972
- I hate for you to see me like this.
- (Chuckles)

40:41.007 --> 40:43.175
Tomorrow you won't
remember any of it.

40:43.209 --> 40:45.311
I always remember everything,

40:45.345 --> 40:47.279
no matter what.

40:48.314 --> 40:51.049
You okay?

40:51.083 --> 40:53.451
I'm spinning a little.

40:53.485 --> 40:56.854
Just try and let
yourself breathe, ma.

40:57.922 --> 41:00.423
You know how to take care of me.

41:00.458 --> 41:03.659
I've been doing it
for long enough.

41:05.095 --> 41:06.796
When you were little...

41:06.830 --> 41:09.165
(Distant train whistle blowing)

41:09.199 --> 41:11.835
I used to lie in bed with you,

41:11.869 --> 41:15.605
curled up.

41:15.640 --> 41:18.843
It would be very quiet.

41:20.912 --> 41:22.880
I'd think,

41:22.915 --> 41:26.751
"there's no one else
in all the world."

41:28.221 --> 41:30.422
There's only you

41:30.457 --> 41:33.458
- "and me."
- (Train whistle blowing)

41:40.298 --> 41:42.365
Good night, ma.

41:43.367 --> 41:44.701
I love you.

41:47.271 --> 41:49.505
There's nothing's wrong, baby.

41:50.707 --> 41:53.376
There's nothing wrong
with any of it.

42:19.271 --> 42:22.007
(Birds chirping)

42:47.631 --> 42:50.801
(Distant train whistle blowing)

42:54.039 --> 42:56.775
(Car passing by)

43:06.486 --> 43:10.122
(Horn blows, car backfires)

43:12.492 --> 43:16.027
- Left right left! Left!
- (Bugle playing)

43:16.062 --> 43:18.930
Left! Left right left!

43:18.964 --> 43:22.666
Left left, left right left!

43:22.701 --> 43:26.737
Left left, left right left!

43:26.771 --> 43:28.872
Left left...

43:28.906 --> 43:32.076
Man: Your enlistment is a contract
with the United States army.

43:32.110 --> 43:34.946
And there are serious
consequences if you break it.

43:34.980 --> 43:37.882
Is that a commitment you're
prepared to make, son?

43:37.916 --> 43:40.719
I wouldn't be here
otherwise, sir.

43:40.753 --> 43:43.255
You haven't listed next of kin.

43:45.692 --> 43:47.560
Both mother and father are gone.

43:48.830 --> 43:50.831
Is there anyone else you'd
like us to contact?

43:53.000 --> 43:54.901
Angela lanotti.

43:54.936 --> 43:57.770
- She's my fiancee.
- What's her address?

44:03.743 --> 44:06.179
Why are you enlisting, son?

44:08.082 --> 44:10.883
Frankly, sir, because I'd
like to stick a bayonet

44:10.917 --> 44:13.452
straight through
the kaiser's guts.

44:13.487 --> 44:16.322
What for?

44:18.024 --> 44:20.893
I lost a brother
on the Lusitania.

44:41.079 --> 44:43.646
Sorry. I didn't
know you were here.

44:44.915 --> 44:47.049
Just peckish is all.

44:47.084 --> 44:49.385
It won't disturb me.

44:56.828 --> 45:00.264
It's... it's chafing her here.

45:00.299 --> 45:03.502
She can't feel it,
of course, so...

45:07.708 --> 45:09.475
May I?

45:18.985 --> 45:20.952
A little rough grommet here.

45:20.987 --> 45:23.454
Could do with a bit
of smoothing out.

45:25.424 --> 45:28.359
I'm a dab hand at
rigging things,

45:28.393 --> 45:30.561
but whatever suits you.

45:32.063 --> 45:34.332
Yes. Thank you.

45:48.116 --> 45:50.251
(Scraping)

46:03.631 --> 46:05.866
Do you think about me?

46:11.540 --> 46:14.308
'Cause I think about you.

46:14.343 --> 46:17.411
- Then you should stop.
- And what if I can't?

46:19.548 --> 46:22.517
Then I'll pray for you to
find the strength to do so.

46:24.087 --> 46:27.188
Well, that'd mean you were
thinking about me, wouldn't it?

46:47.678 --> 46:50.846
(Music playing)

46:58.722 --> 47:01.157
Gillian: James.

47:01.191 --> 47:03.360
Are you there, James?

47:04.495 --> 47:06.663
James!

47:06.698 --> 47:10.501
You have a son and a
business waiting for you.

47:11.770 --> 47:14.171
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

47:14.206 --> 47:16.708
I understand.

47:17.943 --> 47:19.645
It's been days now.

47:19.679 --> 47:21.781
You need to come home
and show the world

47:21.815 --> 47:23.783
you have nothing to hide.

47:34.829 --> 47:37.864
(Snorting)

47:46.607 --> 47:49.408
(Sobbing)

47:53.146 --> 47:55.714
(Phone ringing)

48:07.358 --> 48:09.559
Randolph: Agent van Alden.

48:09.594 --> 48:12.829
This is Mr. Fallon... Mr.
Thompson's new attorney.

48:12.864 --> 48:15.299
How are you this fine day, sir?

48:15.333 --> 48:18.468
And I believe you may
already have met

48:18.503 --> 48:21.271
Deacon Lemuel Cuffy.

48:21.306 --> 48:23.006
Agent sir.

48:23.041 --> 48:25.209
Couple of things to show you.

48:26.544 --> 48:29.046
These were your former
partner's, I believe.

48:29.080 --> 48:30.581
Agent Sebso?

48:39.724 --> 48:42.093
Do you recognize these?

48:43.962 --> 48:47.431
"It is joy for the
just to do judgment."

48:47.466 --> 48:49.694
- Hands straight in front of

48:49.718 --> 48:51.969
you and take a... - (Shouts)

48:53.972 --> 48:56.039
- Did something...
- No!

48:56.074 --> 48:58.609
- Randolph: Clifford!
- Jesus!

48:58.644 --> 49:01.412
(Music playing)

49:16.260 --> 49:18.629
Drinking alone?

49:18.663 --> 49:21.565
Drinking at all?

49:21.599 --> 49:24.335
- Let me get a glass and...
- I've been subpoenaed.

49:27.773 --> 49:30.140
Ignore it.

49:31.476 --> 49:33.410
That's all?

49:33.444 --> 49:35.846
Fallon can handle it.

49:35.880 --> 49:38.014
That's what I'm paying him for.

49:38.049 --> 49:40.551
Yesterday you were convinced

49:40.585 --> 49:42.819
you were going to jail.

49:42.854 --> 49:45.556
Well, today I'm feeling
better about things.

49:45.590 --> 49:47.725
It turns out agent Van Alden

49:47.759 --> 49:49.860
is not a credible witness.

49:49.894 --> 49:52.196
And your brother?

49:53.532 --> 49:56.434
Blood is thicker than water.
I'll think of something.

49:59.204 --> 50:02.373
- We began in sin...
- I do not want to hear about...

50:02.408 --> 50:05.076
We began in sin. We'll end in it

50:05.110 --> 50:06.644
unless we change.

50:06.678 --> 50:08.713
The beginning's over.

50:08.747 --> 50:10.548
The end hasn't come yet.

50:10.583 --> 50:12.450
All I care about is now.

50:12.484 --> 50:15.053
Then look what's happening now!

50:15.087 --> 50:17.922
What's happening now is
you talking rubbish.

50:17.957 --> 50:18.957
You're wrong.

50:19.260 --> 50:21.860
I have never been so sure
of anything in my life.

50:23.696 --> 50:26.365
Emily was stricken
with a disease...

50:26.399 --> 50:28.867
And I am culpable.

50:29.969 --> 50:31.203
How?

50:31.237 --> 50:33.672
I've stolen

50:33.706 --> 50:36.307
and cheated and deceived.

50:36.342 --> 50:39.344
And now I am being
punished for those sins,

50:39.378 --> 50:41.212
as are the ones I love.

50:45.217 --> 50:47.452
Who did you steal from?

50:47.486 --> 50:50.521
My family.

50:50.555 --> 50:52.489
My employer.

50:52.524 --> 50:54.592
You.

50:55.660 --> 50:57.861
Who did you deceive?

50:59.164 --> 51:02.032
Anyone who thinks I'm good.

51:03.468 --> 51:05.503
And who have you cheated on?

51:10.875 --> 51:13.677
Well?

51:13.711 --> 51:16.279
Say it.

51:19.184 --> 51:21.785
I have...

51:23.454 --> 51:26.156
I live with the man

51:26.190 --> 51:29.326
who had the father of
my children murdered.

51:30.261 --> 51:32.529
Really?

51:32.563 --> 51:35.032
- When did I do that?
- You said...

51:35.066 --> 51:37.401
That he deserved it. And
whatever you think I did...

51:37.435 --> 51:39.069
You're lying to me
and to yourself!

51:39.103 --> 51:41.143
Whatever misguided martyrdom
you're contemplating...

51:41.167 --> 51:42.751
I can't go on pretending...

51:42.775 --> 51:44.295
While I'm breaking
my back providing...

51:44.319 --> 51:47.121
That I'm not being
called to account!

51:49.480 --> 51:52.149
Are you actually talking
about testifying?

51:53.719 --> 51:55.586
- (Gasps)
- Have you lost your mind?

51:55.620 --> 51:57.755
Let go of me.

51:57.789 --> 51:59.257
I will not.

51:59.291 --> 52:02.293
You listen. If you want
to punish yourself

52:02.328 --> 52:04.863
because your daughter got
sick, that's your business,

52:04.897 --> 52:07.666
but I will not permit
you to sacrifice me.

52:07.700 --> 52:09.380
"Won't permit"?

52:09.404 --> 52:11.836
And if you don't think
I'm good as my word,

52:12.037 --> 52:14.438
you don't know me at all.

52:14.473 --> 52:17.542
Is that understood?

52:17.576 --> 52:19.977
Will you strike me now?

52:22.848 --> 52:26.484
I have given you everything.

52:31.156 --> 52:33.557
(Music playing)

52:35.427 --> 52:38.196
Gillian: We'll have to
have a funeral, of course.

52:38.230 --> 52:41.833
It's important that
everything look right.

52:41.867 --> 52:44.569
There won't be many
people anyway.

52:44.604 --> 52:47.939
She didn't have a very
wide circle, did she?

52:49.242 --> 52:51.476
The poor girl.

52:51.510 --> 52:53.945
The other one...

52:53.979 --> 52:57.048
She wasn't local. They're
looking for some family.

52:57.082 --> 53:00.018
Not our concern.

53:00.052 --> 53:02.320
We'll need to consider Tommy.

53:02.354 --> 53:06.624
"I told him," mommy went
away for a few days...

53:06.659 --> 53:09.828
"To paint." Well, that
buys us a little time.

53:09.862 --> 53:11.697
I think...

53:11.731 --> 53:13.899
Tell me I'm wrong...

53:13.933 --> 53:15.401
We'll say

53:15.435 --> 53:18.838
she went to live with
her friends in Paris

53:18.872 --> 53:22.041
and she wants her little
boy to stay here,

53:22.076 --> 53:24.778
where she knows he'll be safe

53:24.812 --> 53:28.282
with his daddy who
works so hard,

53:28.316 --> 53:30.784
and his mima

53:30.818 --> 53:33.753
who loves him so very much.

53:36.023 --> 53:38.058
And you know what?

53:38.092 --> 53:40.626
A month from now...

53:40.660 --> 53:43.295
And I don't mean
to sound cold...

53:43.329 --> 53:45.330
He won't even
remember who she...

53:45.364 --> 53:47.932
- (gasps)
- I'll remember!

53:47.967 --> 53:50.234
I'll remember. I'll remember.

53:50.269 --> 53:52.670
- (Gagging)
- I'll remember.

53:52.704 --> 53:54.505
I'll remember.

53:54.539 --> 53:56.006
(Screams)

53:56.041 --> 53:58.409
- Ha!
- (Wheezing)

54:16.160 --> 54:17.926
Gillian: No!

(Spear clanks)

54:26.635 --> 54:28.736
(Sobs)

54:44.522 --> 54:46.890
Then finish it, God damn you.

54:48.459 --> 54:50.394
Finish it.

Jimmy.

- Jimmy, I have to leave.

57:08.167 --> 57:10.235

57:10.269 --> 57:12.704
You see? He didn't go anywhere.

57:15.574 --> 57:17.943
Hey, pal.

57:20.679 --> 57:23.348
I had a bad dream.

57:25.584 --> 57:27.519
Me too.

57:29.622 --> 57:31.490
But everything's gonna be fine.

You didn't mean it.

I know you couldn't.

We don't ever have
to mention it again.

It's all going to be better now.

58:00.620 --> 58:03.188
I hope you're able to see that.

58:22.845 --> 58:26.247
One day soon he won't be
a little boy anymore.

58:26.282 --> 58:28.851
It happens,

58:28.885 --> 58:30.686
just like that.

58:31.855 --> 58:33.989
I'll put him to bed.
