I just...

Is Jimmy okay?

15:43.545 --> 15:45.345
I feel bad, like it's my fault.

15:45.380 --> 15:47.280

Yes, Your Honor. [clears throat]

Not how I'm used to
seeing you in here, Mr. McGill.

16:50.114 --> 16:52.681
Not how I'd like to be seen.

16:52.717 --> 16:55.851
Well, you had quite the day yesterday.

16:55.887 --> 16:57.119
Okay.

16:57.155 --> 16:59.288
Mr. McGill, you've been accused

16:59.323 --> 17:01.323
of fourth degree felony
breaking and entering,

17:26.884 --> 17:30.686
I assume you're prepared
to enter a plea at this time.

17:30.721 --> 17:32.188
Yes, Your Honor.

17:32.223 --> 17:34.523
I wish to enter a plea of not guilty.

17:35.726 --> 17:37.259
The court accepts

17:37.295 --> 17:39.295
and enters the defendant's plea
of not guilty.

17:39.330 --> 17:41.463
Now, Mr. McGill, have you secured counsel?

17:41.499 --> 17:42.698
Kim: Yes.

17:42.733 --> 17:44.300
Uh, Your Honor, Kim Wexler.

17:44.335 --> 17:46.135
I'll be representing Mr. McGill
in this matter.

Your Honor, if I may, um,
I'll be representing myself.

17:53.578 --> 17:56.879
I strongly advise against that, Mr. McGill.

You know what they say about
a man who represents himself.

in the criminal justice system.

to discuss this with your...
potential counsel?

18:17.401 --> 18:19.034
No, Your Honor. I'm all set.

18:19.070 --> 18:21.470

18:22.740 --> 18:24.039
I'm sorry. I'm moving on.

18:24.075 --> 18:25.574

18:25.610 --> 18:26.976
I'm sorry. I was gonna call you,

and no outstanding warrants.

18:38.956 --> 18:41.924

18:47.965 --> 18:50.366

18:50.401 --> 18:52.501
Now, given your ties to the community,

18:52.536 --> 18:54.370
I see no reason to deny you bond,

18:54.405 --> 18:56.772
which I set now at $2,500.

19:38.249 --> 19:39.815
Because he knew Ernie, bless him,

19:39.850 --> 19:41.984
would tell me about it and I would come over

19:42.019 --> 19:44.420

or steal it or whatever.

27:58.466 --> 28:00.299
Good luck.

28:04.105 --> 28:07.006
Burger's getting cold. [Chuckles]

28:07.041 --> 28:08.441
You want it?

28:08.476 --> 28:09.876
- Uh...
- Yeah?

28:09.911 --> 28:11.878
It has too many trans fats.

28:11.913 --> 28:13.112
Ohh!

28:13.148 --> 28:16.649
Those are the best fats.

28:19.754 --> 28:21.554
So they let you keep the car?

28:21.589 --> 28:22.889
- What?
- Davis & Main.

28:22.924 --> 28:26.893
They let you keep the, uh, German car?

28:26.928 --> 28:28.294
No.

28:28.329 --> 28:30.630
That blows.

28:30.665 --> 28:32.431
[Sighs]

28:59.861 --> 29:01.327
[Engine shuts off]

29:01.362 --> 29:03.329

[Engine shuts off]

31:17.598 --> 31:19.565
[Window creaks]

31:19.600 --> 31:21.267
Chuck: Ms. Hay?

31:21.302 --> 31:23.869
- Mr. McGill?
- Chuck, please.

31:23.905 --> 31:25.805
Meet me at the front door.

31:25.840 --> 31:28.040
Uh, they said to put my things
in the mailbox.

31:28.076 --> 31:30.343
Yes, please. Anything with a battery.

31:34.949 --> 31:36.315
[Clattering lightly]

31:36.351 --> 31:39.552
Did your brother <i> ever</i>
have a key to the house?

31:39.587 --> 31:42.054
Before the recent trouble, he did.

31:42.090 --> 31:45.491
He brought me my groceries and sundries.

31:45.526 --> 31:47.393
But we had a falling-out.

31:47.428 --> 31:50.129
I have an employee who does all that now.

31:50.164 --> 31:52.431
You took away your brother's key

31:52.467 --> 31:54.500
when you hired this employee?

31:54.535 --> 31:56.769
I changed the locks.

31:58.339 --> 32:00.506
Going... Going back to the confrontation,

32:00.541 --> 32:04.176
so I have it absolutely clear,
did he strike you?

32:04.212 --> 32:06.078
No, nothing like that.

32:06.114 --> 32:08.314
He backed me into a cabinet.

32:08.349 --> 32:09.582
Did he have a weapon?

32:09.617 --> 32:11.150
Well, as I mentioned,

32:11.185 --> 32:13.252
he used a fireplace poker
to break into my desk.

32:13.287 --> 32:15.187
But he never would have used it on <i> me.</i>

32:15.223 --> 32:17.223
Did you feel physically threatened?

32:18.326 --> 32:19.692
My brother is a lot of things,

32:19.727 --> 32:21.327
but even he has limits.

32:21.362 --> 32:23.929
And you're willing to appear as a witness

32:23.965 --> 32:26.132
even though he's family?

32:26.167 --> 32:27.933
Unfortunately, yes.

32:27.969 --> 32:30.035
If we continue with this,

32:30.071 --> 32:32.505
I'll need your sworn testimony.

32:32.540 --> 32:34.106
[Sighs]

32:34.142 --> 32:36.509
I've had situations
involving family members before

32:36.544 --> 32:39.945
where the injured party
has ultimately been reluctant

32:39.981 --> 32:41.714
to cooperate with my office.

32:41.749 --> 32:43.582
That won't happen.

32:45.686 --> 32:49.588
I'm curious about your strategy.

32:53.194 --> 32:55.361
Well...

32:55.396 --> 32:58.697
as officers of the court,

32:58.733 --> 33:01.734
I feel we should be held
to a higher standard.

33:01.769 --> 33:04.170
I don't intend to take it
easy on your brother

33:04.205 --> 33:05.671
just because he's a lawyer.

33:05.706 --> 33:06.906
Of course not.

33:06.941 --> 33:08.340
The bone of contention

33:08.376 --> 33:10.176
is going to be the felony
breaking and entering.

33:10.211 --> 33:12.745
Your brother's gonna want
to plead down to a misdemeanor,

33:12.780 --> 33:14.914
but I'll hold the line on the felony.

33:14.949 --> 33:16.248
[Clears throat]

33:16.284 --> 33:18.717
Which means this could possibly go to trial.

33:18.753 --> 33:19.985
[Sighs]

33:20.021 --> 33:22.388
Now, I... I want to be mindful

33:22.423 --> 33:24.590
of your comfort and well-being.

33:24.625 --> 33:26.392
With, with your condition,

33:26.427 --> 33:28.227
are you able to appear before the court?

33:28.262 --> 33:29.829
In person?

33:29.864 --> 33:32.064
I certainly appreciate you
accommodating me today

33:32.099 --> 33:33.666
by coming here,

33:33.701 --> 33:36.202
but don't worry,
I'm able to tolerate being out

33:36.237 --> 33:38.404
for short periods
with a few minor adjustments.

33:38.439 --> 33:41.307
Nothing that will
overly inconvenience the court.

33:42.910 --> 33:44.810
I'll get started on this.

33:48.082 --> 33:51.050
Unless you have other concerns.

33:51.085 --> 33:53.219
I just...

33:53.254 --> 33:56.455
I just keep thinking.

33:58.459 --> 34:00.793
[Voice breaking] You know,
Jimmy has a good heart.

34:00.828 --> 34:02.194
I'm, I'm sure he does.

34:02.230 --> 34:03.963
It's not an excuse for what he's done.

34:03.998 --> 34:07.299
[Sighs] But he's my brother.

34:07.335 --> 34:11.036
[Stuttering] And I know... well, he...

34:11.072 --> 34:13.304
well, he's emotional.
He flies off the handle.

34:13.341 --> 34:14.639
I understand,

34:14.675 --> 34:15.908
but this is more than flying off the handle.

34:15.943 --> 34:18.377
I'm not going to defend his actions.

34:18.411 --> 34:20.045
But I can't help wondering

34:20.081 --> 34:22.648
if there's not a better solution.

34:22.683 --> 34:24.049
For everyone.

- [Chuckles]
- Best guess?

41:26.815 --> 41:30.750
I got a deal offer from the ADA today.

41:32.154 --> 41:33.720
And?

41:33.755 --> 41:35.689
It's not what I expected.

41:35.724 --> 41:37.724
Bad not what you expected?

41:37.759 --> 41:40.727
[Sighs] It's just that...

41:40.762 --> 41:43.863
It's different.

41:43.899 --> 41:47.133
She's offering me Pre-Prosecution Diversion.

41:47.169 --> 41:48.902
Seriously?

41:48.937 --> 41:51.338
A PPD?

41:51.373 --> 41:52.739
[Chuckles]

41:52.774 --> 41:55.542
That's great, Jimmy.

41:55.577 --> 41:56.910
[Scoffs]

41:56.945 --> 41:58.912
Best I could hope for, right?

41:58.947 --> 42:00.180
Right.

42:00.215 --> 42:02.482
What does she want you to confess to?

42:02.517 --> 42:04.884
All of it. The felony B and E.

42:04.920 --> 42:08.054
Uh, misdemeanor petty assault
and property damage.

42:08.090 --> 42:11.324
I never touched him,
but they got assault in there.

42:11.360 --> 42:12.926
Well, could be worse.

42:12.961 --> 42:14.928
As long as they never activate it,

42:14.963 --> 42:16.763
it doesn't matter, right?

42:16.798 --> 42:20.367
You gonna be able to keep your
nose clean for a whole year?

42:20.402 --> 42:23.036
Keep "Viktor" with a "k" on lockdown?

42:23.071 --> 42:25.171
It's not a problem, Giselle.

42:25.207 --> 42:27.941
And if I don't, it's instant jail, right?

42:27.976 --> 42:29.743
[Exhales deeply]

42:29.778 --> 42:31.177
Lucky break.

42:31.213 --> 42:33.947
She must not want the hassle of a trial.

42:33.982 --> 42:37.517
[Clicks tongue] Guess so.

42:37.552 --> 42:39.386
Jimmy...

42:39.421 --> 42:40.954
this is good news.

42:40.989 --> 42:43.590
And Chuck is gonna be pissed.

42:43.625 --> 42:45.592
It's a big check in the "pro" column.

42:45.627 --> 42:49.229
Actually, the PPD was Chuck's idea.

42:50.265 --> 42:52.065
Shit.

42:52.100 --> 42:53.933
Yeah.

42:55.237 --> 42:57.937
[Breathes deeply] What's his game?

42:57.973 --> 43:01.808
One condition of the PPD
is that my written confession

43:01.843 --> 43:05.412
is immediately submitted to
the New Mexico Bar Association.

43:05.447 --> 43:07.480
Your written <i>felony</i> confession.

43:07.516 --> 43:09.616
Yeah. I thought he wanted me in jail.

43:09.651 --> 43:12.218
He just wants my law license.

43:12.254 --> 43:13.753
[Sighs]

43:14.823 --> 43:16.823
What are you gonna do?

43:16.858 --> 43:18.625
Well...

43:18.660 --> 43:21.828
I knew the bar was gonna be an issue, right?

43:21.863 --> 43:23.630
So I figured I'd plea the charges down

43:23.665 --> 43:25.432
to a couple misdemeanors, get a censure,

43:25.467 --> 43:28.568
and maybe a little suspension, but...

43:28.603 --> 43:30.837
a confession to a felony?

43:30.872 --> 43:32.739
Grounds for disbarment.

43:32.774 --> 43:35.442
Yeah. And if I take it to trial and I lose,

43:35.477 --> 43:38.144
I face the bar anyways
and jail time, most likely.

43:38.180 --> 43:39.412
[Sighs]

43:39.448 --> 43:41.681
He's got me boxed in.

43:44.286 --> 43:46.152
You can fight this.

43:46.188 --> 43:48.621
The disciplinary board listens
to extenuating circumstances.

43:48.657 --> 43:51.124
No, Chuck knows everybody at the bar.

43:51.159 --> 43:52.959
Hell, he made half their careers.

43:52.994 --> 43:55.995
It's gonna be him and his cronies versus me.

43:56.031 --> 43:57.497
Alone.

44:00.702 --> 44:03.436
- Not alone.
- Kim.

44:03.472 --> 44:05.438
Come on, Jimmy.

44:05.474 --> 44:07.107
You need me.

44:07.142 --> 44:09.476
You can't argue this yourself.

44:09.511 --> 44:11.044
You and I both know that.

44:11.079 --> 44:16.049
And I'm not gonna let you
fight this on your own.

44:16.084 --> 44:19.119
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

44:19.154 --> 44:21.521
'Cause I don't...

44:21.556 --> 44:23.056
[Sighs]

44:23.091 --> 44:25.325
Why would you...

44:25.360 --> 44:26.626
[Sighs]

44:26.661 --> 44:27.994
Come on.

44:28.029 --> 44:29.496
This guy?

44:29.531 --> 44:30.897
Seriously?

44:35.904 --> 44:40.507
Let's just call it
the fallacy of sunk costs.

44:40.542 --> 44:42.142
[Sighs]

44:42.177 --> 44:43.743
So what now?

44:43.778 --> 44:45.078
Now?

44:45.113 --> 44:48.081
Now we, uh, take that PPD,

44:48.116 --> 44:51.284
and we shove it right up Chuck's ass.
