00:00.830 --> 00:02.924
- Previously, on Being Human...

00:02.969 --> 00:04.199
- Josh?
- Julia.

00:04.230 --> 00:05.220
- Julia the fiance?

00:05.270 --> 00:07.136
- You ran away!

00:07.170 --> 00:09.969
- Believe me when I say
it was for the best.

00:10.010 --> 00:13.878
- Our relationship began because
you wanted to feel more human.

00:13.910 --> 00:15.002
I don't think I do.

00:15.040 --> 00:16.201
- So you'd give up on us?

00:16.250 --> 00:18.207
- Aidan, I need my blood.

00:18.250 --> 00:21.072
- The orphans.
Your recommendation?

00:21.120 --> 00:22.884
- Mercy.

00:22.920 --> 00:23.716
- No, they'll be culled.

00:23.750 --> 00:25.889
- I've been
seeing things lately,

00:25.920 --> 00:28.855
something dark that
I let loose in my world.

00:28.890 --> 00:31.029
Reaper.
- There's an order.

00:31.060 --> 00:34.098
I come to those that create
imbalance in that order,

00:34.130 --> 00:35.689
and I get rid of them.

00:35.730 --> 00:36.765
- And now you're
here for me.

00:36.800 --> 00:39.599
- I have to take someone.
Make your arrangements.

00:39.640 --> 00:40.960
- Goodbye.

00:43.910 --> 00:45.867
(Birds chirping)

00:45.910 --> 00:48.004
(Rumbling, clinking)

00:48.040 --> 00:49.201
(Sighing)

00:49.250 --> 00:51.947
Stop shaking, Sally.
Come on, let up!

00:51.980 --> 00:54.039
(Sighing)

00:54.080 --> 00:57.015
He's not coming for you, OK?

00:57.050 --> 00:59.109
Ocean breezes...

00:59.160 --> 01:00.650
(Sighing)

01:00.690 --> 01:01.851
...Cabo...

01:01.890 --> 01:03.221
Phew!

01:03.260 --> 01:06.651
* Girls in white dresses *

01:07.760 --> 01:09.023
Oh crap!

01:09.060 --> 01:12.234
- (Aidan): Even in the most
hopeless battle,

01:12.270 --> 01:15.194
there is a moment
when the tide can turn.

01:15.240 --> 01:17.937
The supplies make it through.

01:17.970 --> 01:21.008
Reinforcements crest the hill.

01:22.310 --> 01:24.347
(Sighing)

01:35.190 --> 01:36.555
(Sighing)

01:37.660 --> 01:39.924
- This could seriously
take me a year to clean up.

01:39.960 --> 01:42.270
- Where there was
no possibility of rescue...

01:42.300 --> 01:43.290
(Whooshing)

01:43.330 --> 01:45.128
...a way presents itself.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.690
(Gasps)

01:50.140 --> 01:52.108
- What is wrong with you?

01:52.140 --> 01:54.199
Do you have any idea
what it's like

01:54.240 --> 01:56.379
to make peace with
being annihilated,

01:56.410 --> 01:59.004
ready to kick it
and then have to wait?

01:59.050 --> 02:00.347
What's it been?
Like, a week?

02:00.380 --> 02:03.816
I feel like I'm an inmate
on supernatural death row!

02:03.850 --> 02:05.887
- I gotta say
I am not overflowing

02:05.920 --> 02:07.149
with sympathy for you.

02:07.860 --> 02:08.883
- So this is
what you do?

02:08.919 --> 02:11.719
You radically mind-screw
ghosts before you reap them?

02:11.760 --> 02:12.955
Classy.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.125
- I found a
loophole for you.

02:16.170 --> 02:18.264
There's one way
you can stay.

02:18.300 --> 02:20.940
- Does it involve me
spending eternity

02:20.970 --> 02:23.837
pushing a boulder up
a mountain or something?

02:23.870 --> 02:26.271
- What would you say
to an afterlife

02:26.310 --> 02:30.372
- of constant travel and
excitement, meeting new ghosts?

02:30.410 --> 02:32.742
- I've won a
Carnival cruise?

02:32.780 --> 02:34.145
- You could take my job,

02:34.180 --> 02:36.046
be Reaper.

02:37.890 --> 02:41.849
It's either that,
or I shred you.

02:44.860 --> 02:47.795
I'll come for
your answer tonight.

02:47.830 --> 02:51.460
- (Aidan): But when help finally
arrives, is it for you...

02:51.500 --> 02:52.467
(Breathing heavily)

02:52.500 --> 02:54.229
...or the enemy?

03:12.990 --> 03:15.288
- OK, Joshie,
the fixer is here.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.129
- What?

03:17.160 --> 03:18.184
Em?

03:19.300 --> 03:20.790
No, no!

03:20.830 --> 03:21.900
- Aidan called me.

03:21.930 --> 03:23.864
He told me how
Nora dumped you

03:23.900 --> 03:25.527
and you've been
calling in sick at work

03:25.570 --> 03:28.540
and you've been holed up in
your room like a wounded animal.

03:28.570 --> 03:31.835
God, it actually smells
like doghouse in here!

03:31.870 --> 03:33.304
- It does?

03:33.340 --> 03:35.809
- When was the last
time you showered?

03:35.840 --> 03:36.807
- Uh, what day is it?

03:36.850 --> 03:38.841
(Scoffing)

03:38.880 --> 03:40.473
- Am I gonna see balls?

03:43.990 --> 03:45.810
Oh!

03:47.960 --> 03:49.325
- I'm so glad
you're here,

03:49.360 --> 03:51.783
my beautiful
baby sister.

03:51.830 --> 03:53.559
I need someone who
is required to love me.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.556
(Emily laughing)

03:54.600 --> 03:56.523
- Holy mother!

03:56.570 --> 03:59.289
You are way worse off
than I thought.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.796
(Sighing)

04:02.240 --> 04:03.867
- The Reaper shreds ghosts

04:03.910 --> 04:05.969
who have thrown
the system out of whack.

04:06.010 --> 04:07.830
And if I don't
take over his job,

04:07.880 --> 04:09.370
he's gonna shred me.

04:09.410 --> 04:14.849
- OK, so, uh, first the Reaper
is a black fog that menaces you.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.247
Then he materializes
to save you, shreds Danny,

04:17.290 --> 04:19.553
but then he says he's
gonna kill you anyway.

04:19.589 --> 04:21.410
And now he offers
you his job.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.556
- You can take the sarcasm
out of your voice,

04:25.590 --> 04:27.900
but yeah,
that's basically it.

04:27.930 --> 04:30.092
- I think that this
Reaper is a poltergeist

04:30.130 --> 04:32.861
with limited social skills
who's messing with you.

04:32.900 --> 04:37.462
- I saw him rip Danny
to confetti in front of me.

04:37.510 --> 04:39.478
This ghost is a reaper.

04:39.510 --> 04:41.478
(Sighing)

04:41.510 --> 04:42.477
You have to
believe me.

04:42.510 --> 04:45.002
- OK. I'm sorry. I--

04:45.050 --> 04:47.144
- Josh doesn't know
any of this.

04:47.180 --> 04:48.545
- So after your shift,

04:48.580 --> 04:51.345
we will go out and
get properly obliterated.

04:51.390 --> 04:53.882
We'll cry it out,
drink it out, throw it up.

04:55.260 --> 04:56.056
You wanna come?

04:56.090 --> 04:57.888
- I do.

04:57.930 --> 04:58.954
- No.

04:58.990 --> 04:59.923
- Uh...

05:03.970 --> 05:05.893
(Aidan and Emily laughing)

05:05.930 --> 05:08.638
- No, this is brother-sister
happy hour, OK?

05:08.670 --> 05:10.559
We're gonna hang.

05:10.610 --> 05:13.238
- I can't anyway,
Emily, but thank you.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.532
- You have classes,
don't you?

05:14.580 --> 05:17.277
- At this point,
it's statistically impossible

05:17.310 --> 05:19.620
for me to pass,
plus I've got friends to see.

05:19.650 --> 05:21.277
Bye, Aidan.

05:21.320 --> 05:22.549
(Sighing)

05:25.650 --> 05:27.379
- You think
that I can do this,

05:27.420 --> 05:29.627
kill other ghosts
just to save myself?

05:29.660 --> 05:31.480
- I can't answer that for you.

05:31.530 --> 05:33.225
- Really? 'Cause no offense,

05:33.260 --> 05:36.366
you seem like the go-to guy
for this kind of thing.

05:37.570 --> 05:39.368
- Every monster

05:39.400 --> 05:42.335
has his or her own
threshold for violence.

05:43.940 --> 05:45.465
But I'll tell
you one thing.

05:45.510 --> 05:47.308
If I was gonna kill anyone,
it'd be the Reaper.

05:47.340 --> 05:50.241
He wants to wipe you out,
you take him down first.

05:52.280 --> 05:54.510
- Holy crap!

05:54.550 --> 05:55.870
OK.

05:56.950 --> 05:58.281
Yeah.

05:58.320 --> 06:01.119
I never even considered
that scenario.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.521
(Car honking)

06:16.070 --> 06:17.469
(Man on CB, indistinct)

06:20.110 --> 06:24.206
- The police found
2 bodies, exsanguinated,

06:24.250 --> 06:28.118
with a constellation
of puncture wounds.

06:30.590 --> 06:33.480
That's from one of
the fringe blood dens.

06:33.520 --> 06:34.919
- I'm already on it.

06:34.960 --> 06:38.123
- These orphans should've
been dust weeks ago.

06:38.160 --> 06:39.924
- Wilson was Bishop's
top man on the force.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.792
He is doing
an exemplary job

06:41.830 --> 06:43.992
of taking over Cecilia's
responsibilities.

06:44.030 --> 06:45.794
- Let's hope
it continues

06:45.830 --> 06:48.492
and you don't end up
stranded in the forest

06:48.540 --> 06:50.861
with both your arms
broken like Cecilia.

06:52.580 --> 06:53.900
- I'm sorry for your loss.

07:11.490 --> 07:14.027
- You're very charming
when you want to be.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.297
- Mother called.

07:19.470 --> 07:22.337
She's planning
another trip to Boston,

07:22.370 --> 07:24.600
see how the city's
been cleaned up.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.841
I told her we executed
all the orphans.

07:30.880 --> 07:33.474
- You said what?
You lied to her?

07:33.520 --> 07:35.648
- What else was
I suppose to say?

07:35.680 --> 07:38.684
That we didn't carry out
a decree issued months ago

07:38.720 --> 07:41.587
because you were out
cleaning up after your wolf?

07:41.620 --> 07:45.352
We need a plan and
we need to stake every one

07:45.390 --> 07:48.724
of those squalling,
little bastards today.

07:52.670 --> 07:54.729
Please don't tell me
you're having 2nd thoughts.

07:54.770 --> 07:55.760
- No, no, no...

07:55.800 --> 07:56.835
(Sighing)

07:56.870 --> 07:58.861
- I need you.

07:58.910 --> 08:00.878
(Sighing)

08:07.780 --> 08:09.782
(Dog barking in distance)

08:14.490 --> 08:15.787
(Knocking)

08:19.630 --> 08:20.449
- Hey.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.592
- Hey.

08:21.630 --> 08:22.563
(Sniffs)

08:22.600 --> 08:25.797
- Um, I'm looking for Henry.

08:25.830 --> 08:27.537
(Sniffs)

08:27.570 --> 08:28.867
- 50 bucks to get in.

08:28.900 --> 08:30.629
- What?

08:30.670 --> 08:33.832
- 50 bucks gets you an official
invite to cross the threshold.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.076
- I, the human owner,
will invite you,

08:36.110 --> 08:38.909
unless you wanna get crispy.

08:38.950 --> 08:40.770
- OK, you know what I am.

08:40.820 --> 08:42.640
- You're awful pale.

08:42.690 --> 08:45.614
Henry don't have any other
kind of friends, so yeah.

08:45.650 --> 08:46.390
- Aidan!

08:46.420 --> 08:48.855
I'll come out.

08:48.890 --> 08:52.690
What, you trying to die today?
He's my oldest friend.

08:54.530 --> 08:56.726
(Bell tolling in distance)

08:59.570 --> 09:01.937
Where have you been?
I thought you abandoned us.

09:01.970 --> 09:03.404
- Suren's on the warpath.

09:03.440 --> 09:04.805
Mother's coming
back to Boston

09:04.840 --> 09:06.831
to check that all the
orphans have been culled.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.508
Suren and I have to hunt down
every last one of you.

09:09.540 --> 09:11.099
- Suren knows about me,
that I'm back?

09:11.150 --> 09:12.709
- Of course not.
Are you kidding?

09:12.750 --> 09:14.570
You'd be dust already.

09:14.620 --> 09:16.247
- You said you'd make
this right for me.

09:16.280 --> 09:18.783
- I am. Put the word out,
get all the orphans you can

09:18.820 --> 09:19.810
to meet here tonight.

09:19.860 --> 09:22.784
Everyone who makes it here
will live, the others...

09:22.830 --> 09:24.650
it'll be a massacre.

09:26.230 --> 09:27.652
(Sighing)

09:27.700 --> 09:29.429
I think I found
a way to save you.

09:30.430 --> 09:31.761
- All of us?

09:31.800 --> 09:32.767
- Yes.

09:37.710 --> 09:39.769
- OK, I'll get them here.

09:41.740 --> 09:43.640
What's the plan?

09:47.850 --> 09:50.080
(Siren in distance)

09:50.120 --> 09:51.713
(Women talking, indistinct)

09:51.750 --> 09:54.617
(* '50s rock and roll )

09:55.460 --> 09:57.155
- Hey.

09:57.190 --> 09:58.828
- You're 2 hours early.
- Yeah, I know.

09:58.860 --> 10:00.897
- Thought you were
at the hospital.

10:00.930 --> 10:03.922
- I was. I was, but it
turns out that the place

10:03.970 --> 10:07.190
where I met, wooed and
was first intimate with Nora

10:07.240 --> 10:10.938
is just a huge reminder of
her and how I screwed up.

10:10.970 --> 10:13.632
So there might as well
just be a mural of her face

10:13.680 --> 10:15.136
painted along
the hallways.

10:18.950 --> 10:20.918
Are we under surveillance?

10:20.950 --> 10:22.042
- Um...

10:25.920 --> 10:27.558
- Hi, there.

10:27.590 --> 10:29.752
- Oh my god! Unbelievable!
You're trying to parent trap us?

10:29.790 --> 10:31.781
- Are you kidding me?

10:31.830 --> 10:35.027
All I had planned was a pleasant
day of getting crap-faced twice.

10:35.060 --> 10:38.462
Yes, once with Julia
and once with you.

10:38.500 --> 10:39.990
- Thank you
for making sure

10:40.040 --> 10:41.166
that Emily didn't have
to day-drink alone.

10:41.200 --> 10:44.033
I can take it from here.
I'll take the next shift.

10:44.070 --> 10:47.108
- Actually, you're
the one interrupting.

10:47.140 --> 10:49.939
I was having drinks
with my friend.

10:49.980 --> 10:51.607
- Who's my sister!

10:51.650 --> 10:53.470
- OK, no more
pissing contests.

10:53.520 --> 10:54.942
You're murdering my buzz.

10:54.980 --> 10:57.950
- Excuse me! Can I get
a shot of tequila, please?

10:57.990 --> 10:59.014
For me and my friend.

10:59.050 --> 11:00.984
- Two shots...

11:01.020 --> 11:02.488
just for this guy.

11:02.520 --> 11:05.023
- OK, wait. The last time
I saw you do shots,

11:05.060 --> 11:06.050
you broke out in hives.

11:06.090 --> 11:09.025
- Let's hive it up.
Bring it.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.559
- Yeah, she's
really hot.

11:13.600 --> 11:14.863
(Laughing)

11:14.900 --> 11:17.039
Yeah, you
gotta meet her.

11:17.070 --> 11:17.969
- Wait up.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.466
(Boys talking, indistinct)

11:19.510 --> 11:20.875
(Whooshing)

11:20.910 --> 11:22.776
- Tell me you at least go
in there once in a while

11:22.810 --> 11:25.472
and make omelettes
dance through the air.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.046
- Sally.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.878
- How are ya?

11:28.920 --> 11:29.887
(Sighing)

11:29.920 --> 11:30.990
- Stressed about Dylan.

11:31.020 --> 11:33.614
- What you did
was save me.

11:36.160 --> 11:38.219
- Forget that sometimes.

11:42.130 --> 11:44.565
- So, uh,
this is awkward.

11:44.600 --> 11:48.889
Um, this sort of ghost, same
genus or subgenus, I don't know,

11:48.940 --> 11:50.169
has been stalking me.

11:51.570 --> 11:53.004
He's trying to
kill me, actually.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.008
- Holy hell!

11:55.040 --> 11:57.304
- I need to know
how to shred him.

11:57.350 --> 12:02.277
And I can't believe I'm asking
you a how-to on ghost murder.

12:02.320 --> 12:03.947
- You just...

12:03.990 --> 12:05.242
(Sighing)

12:05.290 --> 12:08.783
...plunge your hands in
and rip him apart.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.651
- Well, it can't
be that easy.

12:12.690 --> 12:16.126
First, you're ripping
a soul in half.

12:16.160 --> 12:17.867
Second...

12:18.900 --> 12:20.994
this ghost is special.

12:21.040 --> 12:25.102
He's killed before.
That's what he does.

12:25.140 --> 12:29.976
- Look, Sally, you can't just
go up to someone and do this.

12:30.010 --> 12:32.911
You know, I thought Dylan
was gonna shred me.

12:32.950 --> 12:34.349
You know, I thought
I was gonna die

12:34.380 --> 12:36.747
and if I didn't
do something...

12:36.790 --> 12:39.782
You know, like,
my instinct kicked in,

12:39.820 --> 12:41.788
if there even is
a ghost instinct.

12:41.820 --> 12:43.925
- Kind of like
when I cut Danny.

12:43.960 --> 12:45.985
I wanted
to hurt him,

12:46.030 --> 12:47.225
and I did.

12:47.260 --> 12:51.868
- Look, even if this guys is
the Charles Manson of ghosts,

12:51.900 --> 12:55.336
you're taking someone's life
in your hands, their energy,

12:55.370 --> 12:57.737
and you're snuffing it
out forever.

12:57.770 --> 12:59.033
- If I can even do it.

12:59.070 --> 13:01.038
- OK, maybe it's
better you can't!

13:03.050 --> 13:04.848
Shredding makes
you dark, Sally.

13:04.880 --> 13:07.247
The only friends I had
are afraid of me.

13:07.280 --> 13:10.989
Boner doesn't wanna
hang out anymore, you...

13:11.020 --> 13:13.910
You only come around when
you need a kill tutorial.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.883
- It's him or me, Stevie.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.252
- Just make sure you're ready
to ring that bell,

13:18.290 --> 13:19.894
because you can't
un-ring it.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.605
(* Man singing, indistinct )

13:31.640 --> 13:34.905
- So, you and
Nora busted up.

13:34.940 --> 13:37.204
- You told her th--
Of course you told her.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.708
- Oh, it wasn't
a secret,

13:39.750 --> 13:42.048
which I wouldn't have
been able to keep anyway.

13:42.080 --> 13:44.720
- And since when are
you two drinking buddies?

13:44.750 --> 13:46.855
- Since we downed a few
dozen bottles of Cuervo

13:46.890 --> 13:49.018
after you dumped
our asses 3 years ago.

13:49.060 --> 13:51.859
- Crap! This just got serious,
but it's good.

13:51.890 --> 13:56.054
You guys gotta work it out,
like poison. Mmm-mmm-mmm!

13:56.100 --> 13:58.228
- Where are you going?

13:58.270 --> 14:00.830
- When the shrapnel
starts flying,

14:00.870 --> 14:03.931
I don't wanna be
collateral damage.

14:06.940 --> 14:09.204
(Rumbling, whooshing)

14:12.280 --> 14:14.112
- Sally?

14:16.020 --> 14:17.749
You have an answer for me?

14:20.990 --> 14:25.985
The day's running out.
I haven't even touched my quota.

14:32.470 --> 14:34.689
(Whooshing)

14:42.010 --> 14:44.047
(Screaming)

14:45.850 --> 14:47.739
I'll kill you!

14:47.780 --> 14:50.317
- You first!

14:53.920 --> 14:56.059
(Panting)

15:03.930 --> 15:05.989
- So, go ahead,
twist the knife.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.090
Just waiting for me
to ruin things with Nora.

15:09.140 --> 15:10.369
You predicted it.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.004
- I've learned in the last
couple of years

15:13.040 --> 15:15.304
not to ask people
why they broke up.

15:15.340 --> 15:17.809
They're already hurting,
so why not leave them

15:17.850 --> 15:19.944
with a little
fig leaf of dignity.

15:19.980 --> 15:21.778
- Thank you.

15:21.820 --> 15:23.743
- Besides, you already
look miserable.

15:23.790 --> 15:26.714
And I never imagined you would
be mopping up human waste

15:26.750 --> 15:27.717
for a living.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.910
- There it is!

15:29.960 --> 15:31.450
- Even in my most spectacular
revenge scenarios!

15:31.490 --> 15:34.289
- The professional jabs.
I was waiting for this.

15:34.330 --> 15:35.798
- Some pretty
low-hanging fruit.

15:35.830 --> 15:36.820
- Very low.

15:36.860 --> 15:39.397
You know what else is?
Sleeping with my roommate.

15:39.430 --> 15:41.262
- I did not know
he was your roommate.

15:41.300 --> 15:42.790
- Very low.
- We gotta boogie!

15:42.840 --> 15:44.467
I just licked some girl.

15:44.510 --> 15:47.104
- What?
- Licked? With your tongue?

15:47.140 --> 15:49.837
- It's a flirty move I bust out.
Normally, it's cute.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.109
Her boyfriend
didn't think so.

15:51.150 --> 15:52.379
- Licking strangers.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.412
This is-- This is
a hew one for me.

15:54.450 --> 15:56.418
That's new, licking people.
- Hang on!

15:56.450 --> 15:58.817
- That's disgusting.
- Slow down, drunk girl.

16:00.320 --> 16:02.516
(Sighing)

16:02.560 --> 16:04.153
- Well, that was real.

16:04.190 --> 16:05.225
(Whimpers)

16:07.530 --> 16:08.929
(Screaming)

16:09.960 --> 16:11.962
- You seriously thought
that amateur hack job

16:12.000 --> 16:13.035
would work on me?

16:18.240 --> 16:19.708
You thought you could

16:19.740 --> 16:21.105
make me go away?

16:21.140 --> 16:23.142
You thought you
were equal to me?

16:23.180 --> 16:26.104
- Please! Please, I know
you want to spare me.

16:26.150 --> 16:29.017
You said it. You said it
yourself that I'm special,

16:29.050 --> 16:31.587
that I'm not like those other
crazy ghosts that you reap.

16:31.620 --> 16:32.781
Please!

16:32.820 --> 16:35.517
- Just answer me one
question, Sally. How was it?

16:35.560 --> 16:37.289
- What?

16:37.330 --> 16:40.254
- How did it feel
shredding me?

16:41.160 --> 16:42.230
- Like a rush!

16:42.260 --> 16:43.091
Thrilling,

16:43.130 --> 16:46.191
like a rollercoaster
ripping you apart.

16:46.230 --> 16:48.198
(Chuckling)

16:48.240 --> 16:52.199
- That's what it
feels like to reap,

16:52.240 --> 16:55.574
like cutting out some
putrefying wound from the world,

16:55.610 --> 16:57.146
saving other ghosts.

16:59.210 --> 17:00.848
- So, what? It's a
good thing what I felt?

17:00.880 --> 17:03.417
It's a good thing that I tried
to kill you and I liked it?

17:03.450 --> 17:06.579
- Being the Reaper is not
like being a murderer, Sally.

17:06.619 --> 17:08.952
A reaper is
a force of nature,

17:08.990 --> 17:12.324
a hurricane,
a forest fire.

17:12.359 --> 17:15.329
Just think how crowded and
stinking the Earth would be

17:15.359 --> 17:16.327
if nobody died.

17:16.359 --> 17:19.125
Afterlife's
the same way.

17:22.300 --> 17:23.801
- But it's gotta
take its toll.

17:23.839 --> 17:28.038
- Everyday, I knew exactly what
to do, why I was doing it

17:28.079 --> 17:30.503
and I knew that
it was necessary.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.279
I kept the balance

17:32.310 --> 17:35.280
and I have never felt so
powerful or fulfilled,

17:35.320 --> 17:36.913
even when I was alive.

17:38.420 --> 17:40.149
Have you?

17:42.660 --> 17:46.551
- I--I didn't even
get a chance to try.

17:46.590 --> 17:50.049
Who feels powerful
and fulfilled at 23?

17:50.100 --> 17:51.989
- Well, here's your chance.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.930
I can take you...

17:54.970 --> 17:56.597
or you can take over.

17:58.370 --> 18:00.407
(Chuckles)

18:11.050 --> 18:13.155
(Sniffling)

18:15.060 --> 18:17.154
- This whole time
I've been dead...

18:18.590 --> 18:22.049
I've been desperate
for a purpose.

18:27.070 --> 18:30.040
I've tried
possessing, haunting...

18:31.070 --> 18:33.209
a boyfriend.

18:35.380 --> 18:37.178
Maybe I can do this...

18:40.110 --> 18:41.612
be a reaper.

18:45.950 --> 18:48.009
- Let's get your
training wheels on.

18:57.500 --> 19:00.561
(Murmuring)

19:00.600 --> 19:03.035
- OK, so you got
them all here?

19:03.070 --> 19:06.404
- Yeah, and do me a favour
and tread lightly, OK?

19:06.440 --> 19:09.671
To most of them, you represent
the big, bad Mother and Suren.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.702
(Murmuring)

19:12.750 --> 19:14.309
(Clearing throat)

19:23.120 --> 19:25.282
- Listen,
I know you're scared,

19:25.330 --> 19:28.550
and that you have been hunted
and that you feel betrayed.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.626
I can't change the way that
you were brought into this world

19:31.670 --> 19:34.139
or make good on the promises
that you've been given,

19:34.170 --> 19:35.331
but I can get you out.

19:38.210 --> 19:42.738
I have a friend in Baltimore
who is willing to take you in,

19:42.780 --> 19:45.044
and he will set you up
with the professions

19:45.080 --> 19:46.969
that you were
forced to leave behind.

19:47.010 --> 19:49.149
There's blood dens
so you won't starve.

19:49.180 --> 19:50.409
And the best thing of all

19:50.450 --> 19:53.659
is there's no vampire authority
in that city, so no politics.

19:53.690 --> 19:55.681
Mother and Suren
will not hunt you there.

19:55.720 --> 19:58.257
- Wait a minute.
Baltimore?

19:58.290 --> 20:01.123
We're all expected to
just pull up and leave?

20:01.160 --> 20:03.367
- Aiden's offering you
your lives.

20:03.400 --> 20:06.529
- I've lived here for 30 years.
Boston's my home.

20:06.570 --> 20:08.732
- Listen, I know
this is difficult.

20:08.770 --> 20:11.330
But if you stay,
Boston will be nothing more

20:11.370 --> 20:13.532
than a resting place
for your ashes.

20:15.840 --> 20:19.071
(Murmuring)

20:19.110 --> 20:22.478
- Hey! Somebody gonna
tell me what's going on?

20:22.520 --> 20:25.012
- Sorry we're late.

20:25.950 --> 20:27.213
Guy was making a killing
inviting vampires

20:27.260 --> 20:29.115
across the threshold.

20:29.160 --> 20:31.754
- What the hell is this?
I don't know you.

20:31.790 --> 20:35.420
- No, I haven't had a chance
to pay for your hospitality yet.

20:35.460 --> 20:38.361
- I've never been anything
but a friend to you people.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.095
- Relax, Mr. Doris.

20:40.130 --> 20:42.736
Open up the bag.
It'll feel like Christmas.

20:49.480 --> 20:51.505
That's $200,000.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.048
I wanna buy your house.

20:55.080 --> 20:57.287
- What are you doing?
You putting up condos?

20:59.190 --> 21:02.114
Mr. Doris, I need an answer
in 3 minutes.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.787
All those vampires
in your house,

21:03.830 --> 21:05.082
we need to
uninvite them.

21:07.160 --> 21:08.559
(Talking, indistinct)

21:08.600 --> 21:10.591
- Aw, come on! : .
They're screwing us here!

21:10.630 --> 21:12.667
They're dumping us off
like we're garbage.

21:12.700 --> 21:13.633
- (Aidan):
I'm sorry. What?

21:13.670 --> 21:16.230
- Listen to me.
Aidan is trying to help us.

21:16.270 --> 21:19.205
- I'm the only reason
you're still alive right now.

21:20.540 --> 21:23.180
- My lawyer's already
drawn up the deed.

21:32.650 --> 21:34.379
- Aidan, I'll go.

21:34.420 --> 21:36.809
What other choices do
we have, right? Come on.

21:36.860 --> 21:39.659
We stay here and
we're all dead.

21:42.900 --> 21:45.790
- Now, Mr. Doris,
sign it.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.766
(Clicking)

21:51.810 --> 21:54.472
- The vans will come
at midnight to take those

21:54.510 --> 21:56.877
who want to leave
to Baltimore. Talk it over.

21:56.910 --> 21:57.877
(All shouting)

21:57.910 --> 21:59.446
- They still
have questions.

21:59.480 --> 22:02.245
- I don't have time.
They're on board or they're not.

22:06.290 --> 22:07.109
- That's not your name.

22:07.150 --> 22:09.756
- Technicality. The house
needs to be held

22:09.790 --> 22:11.884
by someone with
a heartbeat.

22:11.930 --> 22:13.591
(Clicking)

22:13.630 --> 22:16.600
- I'll go to Baltimore with you
for as long as it takes

22:16.630 --> 22:18.564
to set you up there.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.227
OK?

22:20.270 --> 22:21.738
- Where would
we stay exactly?

22:21.770 --> 22:24.410
- Who is this friend of yours?
Will we all be together?

22:24.440 --> 22:26.704
- It'll be taken care of
in Baltimore.

22:26.740 --> 22:27.901
Henry, let them decide.

22:27.940 --> 22:29.669
(All shouting)

22:29.710 --> 22:32.702
- Terry, all it needs
is your signature.

22:32.750 --> 22:35.776
And once we have that,
they're uninvited.

22:35.820 --> 22:40.109
- You've gotta convince all
of them! Don't give up on them!

22:40.150 --> 22:41.288
Nobody is more stupid
and undeserving than me

22:41.320 --> 22:42.754
and you didn't give up on me.

22:42.790 --> 22:44.326
- Take it outside!
Come on!

22:44.360 --> 22:46.328
- What? What's wrong
with you?

22:46.360 --> 22:48.624
- We have to get out
of here now! It's OK.

22:48.660 --> 22:49.798
(Clicking)

22:55.470 --> 22:57.131
(Sizzling and screaming)

22:58.310 --> 22:59.664
- What's happening?

22:59.710 --> 23:01.872
- Get out of the way! Go!
Go, go, go! Come on!

23:05.980 --> 23:08.449
(Groaning)

23:08.480 --> 23:10.881
(Screaming)

23:14.890 --> 23:15.857
- Joe!

23:15.890 --> 23:17.449
- No, don't!

23:17.490 --> 23:19.527
You were invited.
You were invited!

23:19.560 --> 23:21.289
Let them go.

23:22.600 --> 23:24.694
(Screaming and sizzling)

23:27.670 --> 23:29.434
- What did you do?

23:29.470 --> 23:30.767
(Panting)

23:36.480 --> 23:37.709
You played me!

23:37.750 --> 23:40.003
- It was the only way. I told
Suren you'd deliver the orphans

23:40.050 --> 23:43.270
and in exchange,
she'd spare you.

23:45.320 --> 23:46.788
- All those people?

23:47.790 --> 23:49.349
What kind of
monster are you?

23:49.390 --> 23:52.325
- I'm the kind of monster
who chose his own son

23:52.360 --> 23:53.725
over a bunch of vampires

23:53.760 --> 23:56.422
whose sentence was meted
out a long time ago.

23:56.460 --> 23:58.428
I didn't play you, Henry.
I saved you.

23:58.470 --> 24:00.495
There was nothing
we could do for them.

24:00.540 --> 24:03.237
There was a noose around
every one of their necks.

24:03.270 --> 24:04.362
(Sighing)

24:04.410 --> 24:06.230
At least this way
you get to live,

24:06.270 --> 24:07.874
and now you can go
anywhere you want,

24:07.910 --> 24:08.900
do whatever you want.

24:08.940 --> 24:10.544
No one's gonna be
gunning for you.

24:10.580 --> 24:12.241
(Panting)

24:12.280 --> 24:14.476
- I told you I'm not
running anymore.

24:14.520 --> 24:16.477
I wanna stay
in Boston.

24:16.520 --> 24:19.239
That's why I came back
in the first place.

24:19.290 --> 24:20.246
- No.

24:20.290 --> 24:21.689
- To help you lead it.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.984
- No. I'd have to bring
you in front of Suren,

24:24.030 --> 24:25.782
I'd have to present
you face to face.

24:25.830 --> 24:27.889
And the last time
that she saw you...

24:27.930 --> 24:29.796
I don't know if
you get it, Henry.

24:29.830 --> 24:32.800
She was so much more than
just screwing some girl.

24:32.830 --> 24:34.264
(Approaching sirens)

24:35.070 --> 24:36.367
Come on!

24:38.410 --> 24:40.902
- OK, let's get the lovely
drunken lady in here.

24:40.940 --> 24:42.476
- You have a guest room?

24:42.510 --> 24:44.239
- I can walk, you know.
- Keep her head up.

24:44.280 --> 24:48.410
- We tried that and you fell,
remember? Here, prop up.

24:48.450 --> 24:49.417
(Grunting)

24:49.450 --> 24:50.417
(Gagging)

24:50.450 --> 24:52.589
Trash can.

24:54.520 --> 24:55.681
Ibuprofen's better.

24:55.720 --> 24:57.449
- It'll irritates
the gastro lining.

24:57.490 --> 24:58.958
Remember she
had that ulcer?

24:58.990 --> 25:01.391
- What are you doing?
- No, no!

25:01.430 --> 25:04.070
- Are you trying
to O.D. on that?

25:04.100 --> 25:05.864
- Can't O.D. on aspirin.

25:05.900 --> 25:07.595
- (Both):
Actually, you can.

25:08.600 --> 25:10.364
- She didn't
take enough.

25:13.880 --> 25:14.779
What?

25:14.810 --> 25:18.769
- This is just exactly
how Em's prom ended,

25:18.810 --> 25:22.440
with us talking her
drunk butt into bed.

25:23.990 --> 25:26.448
- And I think I was the one
who gave her the aspirin.

25:26.490 --> 25:29.289
- And I put the
trash can by the bed.

25:34.630 --> 25:36.621
- Now it's your turn, Sally.

25:39.130 --> 25:41.633
- (Sally):
Is this a joke?

25:41.670 --> 25:43.729
You brought me here
to reap Stevie?

25:45.110 --> 25:48.603
No way. I'm not gonna
ax-murder Stevie.

25:48.640 --> 25:49.903
- He's shredding ghosts.

25:49.940 --> 25:51.874
That's something
only a reaper can do.

25:51.910 --> 25:53.548
- He was defending himself.

25:53.580 --> 25:57.073
He was defending me from
a ghost who was possessing,

25:57.120 --> 25:58.485
who tried to rape me.

25:59.450 --> 26:01.953
Stevie's-- He's the
sweetest soul I know!

26:01.990 --> 26:05.085
- Sally, you think
that was the only time?

26:05.130 --> 26:08.896
You know how good it feels to
shred. You felt it firsthand.

26:08.930 --> 26:10.000
Stevie can't stop.

26:10.030 --> 26:11.725
- No, he feels terrible.

26:11.770 --> 26:15.400
He's totally tortured. All his
friends deserted him, and no!

26:15.440 --> 26:18.762
- He shredded them, Sally!
Dylan, Boner.

26:18.810 --> 26:20.460
Stevie lied to you.

26:20.510 --> 26:23.901
Now he's stalking the guy who
tormented him in high school,

26:23.950 --> 26:26.578
just waiting
for him to die.

26:26.610 --> 26:28.044
- You mean Van?

26:28.080 --> 26:31.948
- Stevie told you the first
killing, it made him dark.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.950
- How do you know
what Stevie told me?

26:36.990 --> 26:38.526
(Chuckling)

26:38.560 --> 26:39.959
- You don't
get it, do you?

26:39.990 --> 26:42.823
I know so much more
than you think I know.

26:44.630 --> 26:46.598
- I can--
I can fix him.

26:46.630 --> 26:49.463
I can fix Stevie.
I could turn him around.

26:49.500 --> 26:52.299
There's so many sicker ghosts
out there that we can reap.

26:52.340 --> 26:54.434
- That's not who
you are anymore.

26:54.480 --> 26:56.733
You still think you're
that person you were

26:56.780 --> 26:57.804
when you were alive?

26:57.850 --> 26:58.874
Warm and bubbly
Sally Malik

26:58.910 --> 27:03.040
who stays up late giving
her friends hugs and advice?

27:03.080 --> 27:04.912
You slashed Danny.

27:04.950 --> 27:07.715
You possessed a woman
and scrambled her brains.

27:07.760 --> 27:10.479
You tried to take over a
premature baby to save yourself,

27:10.520 --> 27:13.421
- Yeah, but I didn't, and that's
why you didn't reap me,

27:13.460 --> 27:14.598
because I'm not evil.

27:14.630 --> 27:15.950
- Of course you're not.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.890
I picked you because
you'd be good at this.

27:18.930 --> 27:19.761
You know the dark.

27:19.800 --> 27:22.064
You've experienced it.
You can judge it.

27:22.100 --> 27:24.899
And after what happened
to you, your murder,

27:24.940 --> 27:27.910
you couldn't have
turned out any other way.

27:27.940 --> 27:30.637
You're destined
to be a reaper.

27:32.480 --> 27:34.574
- I ca-- I can't
reap Stevie.

27:34.620 --> 27:36.679
- This is
the job, Sally.

27:36.720 --> 27:39.712
If you don't
reap him, I will.

27:40.990 --> 27:42.788
(Siren in distance)

27:53.630 --> 27:56.839
- Holy! Is this a real Eames?

27:56.870 --> 27:57.962
- You're the
only guy I know

27:58.010 --> 27:59.967
that can get excited
about a chair.

28:00.010 --> 28:01.933
- This is a very guy chair.

28:01.980 --> 28:05.006
This is a serious
score, Julia!

28:05.050 --> 28:06.848
(Sighing)

28:07.880 --> 28:09.871
(* Man singing, indistinct )

28:19.990 --> 28:24.359
I forget how intimate it is
being in someone's house.

28:28.270 --> 28:30.739
It's weird. I never
imagined I'd be here.

28:30.770 --> 28:33.899
- What's weird is that
we used to be intimate

28:33.940 --> 28:35.977
and now we're not,

28:36.010 --> 28:39.742
so we're reduced to making
small talk about chairs,

28:39.780 --> 28:41.976
when really what
we're thinking is:

28:42.020 --> 28:44.045
"I used to sleep
with this person.

28:44.090 --> 28:47.048
"I was gonna marry
this person.”

28:48.620 --> 28:50.110
- You want me to go?

28:51.860 --> 28:54.352
- That would be
the smart thing to do.

29:22.620 --> 29:24.850
- I know I have no right
to say this,

29:24.890 --> 29:28.554
and it's gonna sound
condescending and enraging

29:28.600 --> 29:31.865
and it may result
in you hitting me again,

29:31.900 --> 29:34.995
but I've known you
since you were 17,

29:35.040 --> 29:38.203
what a train wreck
your family is,

29:38.240 --> 29:41.039
and what it took you
just to get through college,

29:41.080 --> 29:43.003
and everything after...

29:45.080 --> 29:46.570
us.

29:47.280 --> 29:48.941
And I'm so proud of you.

29:48.980 --> 29:54.111
You're amazing. You accomplished
everything you said you would.

29:56.720 --> 30:01.920
- Well, um, since
we're being honest...

30:03.970 --> 30:05.222
and dumb...

30:07.700 --> 30:09.930
A while back
you asked me...

30:11.670 --> 30:13.638
why I came to Boston.

30:15.380 --> 30:18.008
I came to find you.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.880
(Car honking)

30:46.710 --> 30:48.872
- Henry, we have to leave!

30:52.780 --> 30:54.771
I always imagined if
I ever saw you again,

30:54.820 --> 30:56.879
I'd be plunging a
stake in your heart.

30:56.920 --> 31:00.185
- To be honest, that's how
I thought I'd die too.

31:00.220 --> 31:02.860
So here's your chance.

31:02.890 --> 31:05.723
If you can't
accept me, then end it.

31:07.460 --> 31:08.825
(Screaming)

31:11.000 --> 31:15.062
- Henry delivered the orphans
to us like I said he would.

31:15.100 --> 31:17.660
- You're a useful little
turncoat, aren't you?

31:17.700 --> 31:19.759
But you're like
a weathervane,

31:19.810 --> 31:22.973
spinning, spinning whichever way
the prevailing wind blows.

31:23.010 --> 31:24.978
- I know you won't believe it,

31:25.010 --> 31:26.876
but I am changed.

31:26.910 --> 31:28.947
- You really want
him at your side?

31:30.820 --> 31:32.845
- Yes.

31:32.890 --> 31:35.416
- I'll never forgive
you for this!

31:35.460 --> 31:38.885
- If you wanna buy your way
back into this court,

31:38.930 --> 31:42.389
Mother and I are going to
need a token of your penance.

31:42.430 --> 31:44.467
For the massacre
in this hotel,

31:44.500 --> 31:46.821
I was put to ground
for 80 years.

31:46.870 --> 31:48.690
And you just turned
tail and ran.

31:49.970 --> 31:52.940
For your part in causing it
and for organizing the orphans,

31:52.970 --> 31:55.769
Mother's gonna want
her pound of flesh.

31:57.540 --> 31:59.269
And for what
you did to me,

32:00.310 --> 32:02.870
I'm gonna need
a little more.

32:06.720 --> 32:08.154
- When Emily told me

32:08.190 --> 32:10.181
where you were working,

32:10.220 --> 32:12.120
I interviewed for
the hell of it

32:12.160 --> 32:14.299
to see if I'd
run into you.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.459
I didn't.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.059
And then when
I took the job,

32:19.100 --> 32:22.229
I told myself it was because
I wanted to be in Boston.

32:22.270 --> 32:23.931
I couldn't admit to myself

32:23.970 --> 32:26.200
that what I really
wanted was to see you...

32:28.180 --> 32:31.104
hear from you
why you left.

32:31.150 --> 32:33.300
And I know I just
make myself sound

32:33.350 --> 32:38.015
like some kind of crazy stalker,
but I am beyond caring.

32:38.050 --> 32:41.088
- The night Stu died,

32:41.120 --> 32:44.852
when I was mauled,

32:44.890 --> 32:47.427
the attack changed me.

32:47.460 --> 32:49.394
I cracked up
after that.

32:49.430 --> 32:53.469
I felt set apart
from everyone,

32:53.500 --> 32:58.301
like I was watching other normal
people go on with their lives.

33:00.310 --> 33:03.405
- Survivor guilt is not
what drove you away.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.772
- Yes.
- Just tell me the truth!

33:05.810 --> 33:08.780
- I am telling you
the truth, Julia.

33:08.820 --> 33:12.609
- You're not. Or what?

33:12.650 --> 33:14.084
You didn't have the guts
to call off the wedding

33:14.120 --> 33:15.190
SO you ran away.

33:15.220 --> 33:17.279
- No! That wasn't
what it was!

33:17.320 --> 33:19.459
- Then what was it?
Was it something else?

33:19.490 --> 33:21.151
Someone else?

33:21.200 --> 33:24.192
- Fine! You wanna know
the real reason I left?

33:24.230 --> 33:25.265
- Yes!

33:25.300 --> 33:27.120
- A month after the attack,

33:27.170 --> 33:29.229
I found out that
I was a monster.

33:29.270 --> 33:32.160
If I had stayed, this is
what would've happened:

33:32.210 --> 33:34.406
I would've lied to you to
get you to stay with me,

33:34.440 --> 33:36.738
I would've infected you with
my violence and my rage

33:36.780 --> 33:38.600
and I would've dragged
you down with me!

33:38.650 --> 33:40.049
And then one day,
I would've killed you

33:40.080 --> 33:41.775
or I would've
hurt you so bad,

33:41.820 --> 33:43.174
that you ran
away from me,

33:43.220 --> 33:44.642
from your friends,
from your life,

33:44.690 --> 33:46.749
from everyone
who loves you!

33:55.860 --> 33:58.124
(Breathing unevenly)

33:59.300 --> 34:01.359
(Sighing)

34:01.400 --> 34:03.129
I'm so--

34:03.170 --> 34:05.059
I'm so sorry.

34:07.370 --> 34:09.371
Are you OK?

34:13.550 --> 34:15.143
(Panting)

34:17.480 --> 34:18.982
(Slaps thigh)

34:19.020 --> 34:20.487
You know what, though?

34:20.520 --> 34:25.128
The most screwed-up part
about being here with you...

34:26.989 --> 34:28.128
(Crying)

34:28.159 --> 34:30.857
...is that I'm relieved.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.889
This feels
almost normal...

34:36.139 --> 34:40.202
confiding in you
like we used to.

34:45.310 --> 34:47.870
(Sighing)

34:51.690 --> 34:53.043
I'm gonna--

34:53.090 --> 34:54.045
(Sniffling)

34:54.090 --> 34:55.956
I'm gonna go.

35:04.830 --> 35:07.720
- I know just
the punishment, Henry.

35:07.770 --> 35:10.660
My father's people,
the Mongols,

35:10.700 --> 35:13.567
love their animals:
horses, sheep, goats.

35:13.610 --> 35:16.932
They knew how
to skin almost anything.

35:16.980 --> 35:21.941
And when it was necessary
to torture their enemies...

35:21.980 --> 35:24.688
they would flay his skin
whole, in one piece,

35:24.720 --> 35:27.018
while he was alive,
of course,

35:27.050 --> 35:29.553
like peeling a shrimp.

35:29.590 --> 35:32.025
This kind of skinning
was considered an art.

35:32.060 --> 35:35.325
- You've gotta be kidding me.
This is completely personal.

35:35.360 --> 35:37.328
- I didn't say
I wouldn't enjoy it.

35:37.360 --> 35:40.227
Of course, a vampire
wouldn't die from this.

35:40.270 --> 35:41.431
Your skin will grow back.

35:41.470 --> 35:44.064
- OK. All right. Enough.

35:44.100 --> 35:45.067
(Exhales sharply)

35:45.110 --> 35:46.259
No more horror stories.

35:50.010 --> 35:53.105
He asked the price,
and there it is.

35:59.990 --> 36:03.119
- You really wanna come back?
- Of course I do.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.026
- Then it's your choice.

36:06.060 --> 36:09.257
This will placate
her and Mother.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.124
Henry, I'm sorry.

36:13.170 --> 36:15.229
I tried to tell you
80 years ago.

36:15.270 --> 36:19.503
There's a price to pay for
screwing around with the royal.

36:19.540 --> 36:21.235
(Gulps)

36:30.550 --> 36:31.745
(Aidan sighing)

36:31.790 --> 36:36.717
Suren, any fear that Mother has
that you are sentimental...

36:36.760 --> 36:38.455
(Scoffing)

36:38.490 --> 36:39.685
...Or weak,

36:39.730 --> 36:43.496
this will show her
that you're fit to rule.

36:43.530 --> 36:44.998
But...

36:45.030 --> 36:47.021
(Sighing)

36:48.540 --> 36:50.759
- I love how
simple it is.

36:50.800 --> 36:55.033
The blade's so thin
and razor-sharp,

36:55.080 --> 36:57.037
so it doesn't tear the skin.

37:05.450 --> 37:07.782
- You just
remember one thing.

37:07.820 --> 37:10.812
Henry is my blood.

37:10.860 --> 37:15.297
And he had better be alive
when I come back for him.

37:16.530 --> 37:18.521
(Sniffling)

37:30.810 --> 37:33.040
(Henry screaming)

37:34.320 --> 37:38.075
- (Henry): Don't, please!
Please kill me!

37:41.190 --> 37:44.785
- I tried to talk him out
of it, but he wants to take you.

37:44.830 --> 37:46.252
You just have to
stop killing!

37:46.290 --> 37:48.793
We just have to convince
him that you stopped.

37:48.830 --> 37:51.299
- I don't know! All I did
was save you from Dylan!

37:51.330 --> 37:54.698
- We know about Boner. And Van?
You're stalking him now?

37:54.740 --> 37:56.799
- You're following me?
- No, I told you!

37:56.840 --> 37:59.707
That's what the Reaper does!
He knows what we've done.

37:59.740 --> 38:02.277
- I haven't done
anything! I mean, yes.

38:02.310 --> 38:05.075
I played a few tricks on Van,
but Boner, he's still here!

38:05.110 --> 38:06.544
- Where? Where is he?

38:06.580 --> 38:08.674
- I don't know!
I told you he went away.

38:08.720 --> 38:13.089
- Stevie, I know what it
feels like to kill.

38:13.120 --> 38:14.451
I know how
good it feels.

38:14.490 --> 38:16.288
- I don't know what
you're talking about!

38:16.320 --> 38:18.721
- I'm trying to save you.
You're unbalanced!

38:18.760 --> 38:20.182
- I'm unbalanced?
- Yes!

38:20.230 --> 38:23.256
- You passed up your door
and you possess!

38:23.300 --> 38:25.826
I tried to stop you,
all 3 of you. Dylan, Boner.

38:25.870 --> 38:27.167
You guys don't listen!

38:27.200 --> 38:28.838
- I know Dylan
was a mistake,

38:28.870 --> 38:30.133
but Boner and Van--

38:30.170 --> 38:32.366
- Stop talking
about Boner!

38:32.410 --> 38:35.675
Look, I'm happy he's gone!
He can't judge me anymore!

38:35.710 --> 38:38.099
And Van! You know what
a monster he is?

38:38.140 --> 38:40.302
I'm not sorry
for haunting him.

38:40.350 --> 38:42.614
Maybe if he dies,
I will shred him!

38:42.650 --> 38:44.414
- Oh, Stevie.

38:45.750 --> 38:49.584
I don't think I can
help you anymore.

38:49.620 --> 38:51.588
- I don't need
your help! You're crazy!

38:55.360 --> 38:56.657
(Groaning)

38:59.200 --> 39:00.668
(Whimpering)

39:02.640 --> 39:04.438
(Gasping)

39:04.470 --> 39:06.404
- You're almost there.

39:07.410 --> 39:09.572
You'll reap your
first soul tomorrow.

39:10.780 --> 39:12.748
(Whimpering)

39:16.450 --> 39:17.975
(Siren in distance)

39:18.020 --> 39:20.239
- How is it that
you look so fresh?

39:20.290 --> 39:22.782
- I find a good puke
purges the pores.

39:22.820 --> 39:24.310
- Ah!

39:24.360 --> 39:26.749
- Trouble is, you keep
all your alcohol inside.

39:26.790 --> 39:27.757
- Got it.

39:27.790 --> 39:28.757
(Chuckling)

39:28.800 --> 39:30.825
- Hey...

39:30.860 --> 39:33.192
Thank you for
the intervention.

39:34.500 --> 39:36.537
Whatever happens with Nora, at
least Julia and I won't have to

39:36.570 --> 39:38.607
hiss at each other in
the hallway anymore.

39:38.640 --> 39:42.406
- Yeah, about that.

39:42.440 --> 39:43.930
I may have passed
out last night,

39:43.980 --> 39:46.301
but I was still
perceptive enough

39:46.350 --> 39:48.148
to pick up on
those sparks.

39:49.050 --> 39:50.916
You didn't bang her,
did you, Josh?

39:50.950 --> 39:52.281
- No.

39:52.320 --> 39:54.789
- Well, that was your
one and only chance

39:54.820 --> 39:57.289
at the drunken, angry,
depressed, revenge screw.

39:57.320 --> 39:58.219
- You're right.

39:58.260 --> 39:59.887
- Now you two definitely

39:59.930 --> 40:01.250
can't sleep together.

40:01.290 --> 40:02.496
It'd be too conscious.

40:02.530 --> 40:04.498
- I would never...

40:04.530 --> 40:05.964
(Giggling)

40:06.000 --> 40:08.867
...get involved
with Julia again.

40:08.900 --> 40:11.437
- Uh-huh? Wow. Yeah,
you didn't even try

40:11.470 --> 40:12.938
to make that convincing.

40:12.970 --> 40:14.836
- No, it's not even her.

40:14.880 --> 40:15.779
It's what I used to be.

40:15.810 --> 40:19.246
Normal, successful, settled.

40:19.280 --> 40:21.408
- Well, what's normal?

40:21.450 --> 40:22.679
All that crap's
overrated, Josh.

40:22.720 --> 40:25.815
- No. Actually, it's quite
appropriately rated.

40:25.850 --> 40:28.342
People think they want to
be edgy and rebellious,

40:28.390 --> 40:30.518
but really all they want is
a cozy house to come home to

40:30.560 --> 40:31.686
and someone who loves them.

40:31.730 --> 40:34.256
- What is this?
Prairie Home Companion?

40:36.000 --> 40:37.354
(Birds chirping)

40:37.400 --> 40:41.325
- Julia is safe from me.

40:41.370 --> 40:43.668
- Good, 'cause
nobody deserves

40:43.700 --> 40:46.601
to be destroyed
twice in one lifetime.

40:46.640 --> 40:48.005
- Uh...

40:48.040 --> 40:49.439
- Hmm!

40:49.480 --> 40:50.470
(Sighing)

40:51.240 --> 40:52.571
- Thank you.

40:52.610 --> 40:53.645
- Anytime.

40:53.680 --> 40:55.114
- No, for real.

40:55.750 --> 40:57.240
Yep.

41:01.050 --> 41:05.851
** Honey, how will you know
if you found me *

41:05.890 --> 41:08.496
%
At long last? *

41:08.530 --> 41:09.497
(Door opening)

41:09.530 --> 41:10.998
* How can I meet you *

41:11.030 --> 41:14.261
* With my heart
stuck in this cast? *

41:15.440 --> 41:16.965
* God bless us all *

41:17.000 --> 41:19.765
* We don't know a thing *

41:21.010 --> 41:22.671
* God rest our souls *

41:22.710 --> 41:24.576
- You're still here.

41:24.610 --> 41:26.772
* I pray that we can sing *

41:26.810 --> 41:27.948
- Still here.

41:28.950 --> 41:30.679
Just kickin' it.

41:34.090 --> 41:36.058
- And the Reaper?

41:36.090 --> 41:38.286
* Your wilderness *

41:38.320 --> 41:40.049
- He's not a problem anymore.

41:40.090 --> 41:42.650
* It comes tumbling
through my veins *

41:42.700 --> 41:47.490
* Light a candle 'cause
I'm sure to lose my way... *

41:49.500 --> 41:52.037
- Did you, uh...

41:52.070 --> 41:54.004
- I don't wanna
talk about it.

41:56.410 --> 41:57.775
But no.

41:57.810 --> 42:01.610
* Patience's thin
It's harder to let you in *

42:01.650 --> 42:03.709
- What did you...

42:03.750 --> 42:05.684
* Hold on *

42:05.720 --> 42:07.040
...learn about yourself?

42:07.090 --> 42:08.683
* Let go *

42:08.720 --> 42:11.655
- * All I know
is all about love *

42:11.690 --> 42:13.920
- I'm still learning.

42:13.960 --> 42:16.099
(Whooshing)

42:16.130 --> 42:18.098
* Hold on *

42:18.130 --> 42:19.723
(Screaming)

42:19.770 --> 42:21.397
* Hold on *

42:22.500 --> 42:25.003
* Hold on *

42:25.040 --> 42:28.305
* It's always love *

42:31.080 --> 42:34.675
* It's such a shame
about that flood *

42:34.720 --> 42:36.040
- Me too.

42:38.550 --> 42:40.348
* These wicked tricks *

42:40.390 --> 42:43.917
* That are played on us *

42:44.930 --> 42:46.819
* You wish for water *

42:46.860 --> 42:51.024
* Then the flames
are set on you *

42:51.060 --> 42:53.859
* When the night comes *

42:53.900 --> 42:56.699
* No one ever
knows what to do *

43:01.340 --> 43:06.801
<i>*Xk</i>
