A SERIES BASED ON THE BOOK "ANNA"
WRITTEN BY NICCOLÃ’ AMMANITI IN 2015

00:19.560 --> 00:22.200
THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
HIT 6 MONTHS AFTER FILMING BEGAN

00:26.120 --> 00:29.200
THE HYENAS LAUGH

01:13.520 --> 01:14.840
Hi.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.400
My name's Anna, what's yours?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.720
How long have you been here?

01:25.960 --> 01:27.560
Can you hear me?

01:27.640 --> 01:29.440
Can you talk?

01:48.320 --> 01:50.120
He can't talk.

01:51.040 --> 01:54.640
I got him to dig, but he's no good at it.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.280
I keep him for company.

02:06.720 --> 02:10.440
My father said
that all animals can be tamed,

02:10.520 --> 02:14.080
the secret is to be nice at times
and mean at others,

02:14.160 --> 02:16.440
so they don't understand.

02:16.520 --> 02:20.480
As my brother and I are equal,
we share the tasks:

02:20.560 --> 02:22.760
one is nice and one is mean.

02:25.160 --> 02:27.360
I bet you're the mean one.

02:28.720 --> 02:30.560
You bet right.

02:31.560 --> 02:35.960
But I'll be nice to you,
if you'll be my digging dog.

02:36.040 --> 02:38.360
Are you sure you're the mean one?

02:40.040 --> 02:42.280
I remember at school

02:42.360 --> 02:45.320
they called you
the asshole and the dumbass.

02:46.360 --> 02:48.040
I think you're the dumbass.

02:53.480 --> 02:55.600
No, stop it!

03:01.280 --> 03:03.320
Remember when you came to the store?

03:04.320 --> 03:06.480
You never said hello to us.

03:07.480 --> 03:10.440
You came with your mom
to buy stracchino cheese.

03:11.760 --> 03:15.160
My dad said she was
a filthy rich Milanese slut.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.720
We have special robiola cheese.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.720
No, I prefer stracchino.

03:37.840 --> 03:40.040
Fuck you!

03:40.120 --> 03:42.040
What a weird world,

03:42.160 --> 03:45.280
now you're the dog
and I'm your master.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.240
C'mon, we've got to escape.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.320
Dig, bitch.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.000
What for?

05:20.840 --> 05:23.400
To build a cellar for ice-cream.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.360
We're going to make chocolate ice-cream.

05:27.720 --> 05:30.440
- It's concrete, dumbass.
- No.

05:31.400 --> 05:36.320
I'm a "morass", a cross between
a moron and a dumbass.

05:45.440 --> 05:46.760
Go on, dig!

06:08.120 --> 06:11.280
Eat up, it's with venison and potatoes.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.320
Sleep now, little canary.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.760
Wash up, you stink.

06:58.360 --> 07:00.640
You're a beautiful bitch, but you stink.

07:11.280 --> 07:13.480
When I get out,
I'm gonna kill you, dumbass.

07:37.280 --> 07:39.000
Wake up.

07:47.720 --> 07:49.640
You're really hungry, aren't you?

08:00.000 --> 08:01.680
Look what I got for you.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.200
Good girl.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.120
Want another piece?

08:23.080 --> 08:26.280
See? A little mean and a little nice.

08:45.640 --> 08:48.200
Soon the world will be all mine,

08:49.280 --> 08:50.640
right?

08:55.560 --> 08:57.280
Good girl!

08:58.240 --> 08:59.760
At last.

09:01.160 --> 09:02.680
You're a good girl.

09:06.480 --> 09:09.040
I'll call you Beauty.

09:09.120 --> 09:11.560
Like Mrs. Scardamaglia's
Yorkshire terrier.

09:14.280 --> 09:17.160
You're a good girl,
aren't you, Beauty?

09:20.360 --> 09:22.040
Don't bite me.

09:41.960 --> 09:43.600
Kiss my finger.

09:43.680 --> 09:45.520
Go on, kiss it.

09:54.520 --> 09:57.040
You wanna go for a walk?

10:06.640 --> 10:08.320
I'll let you out.

10:13.440 --> 10:14.520
Come on.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.240
Good girl.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.200
Good girl, Beauty.

10:32.120 --> 10:33.360
Come.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.240
That's it.

10:45.560 --> 10:46.720
Your paw.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.400
Good.

10:52.480 --> 10:54.240
Come on, heel.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.600
Up on two legs, Beauty.

11:20.440 --> 11:22.280
He liked tuna.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.680
Look, I'll show you something.

11:50.240 --> 11:53.040
What a drag, they never leave me alone.

11:55.320 --> 11:59.680
- Are you there?
- We're closed, hear me?

11:59.760 --> 12:02.880
- Go see who it is.
- I don't want to.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.920
They'll stop eventually.

12:18.120 --> 12:19.480
Let go of me!

12:57.400 --> 12:59.160
So, you're here!

13:02.000 --> 13:03.600
Which one are you?

13:05.360 --> 13:07.000
Mario.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.040
Cool, huh?

13:16.320 --> 13:18.240
Actually, it's really cool.

13:37.640 --> 13:40.200
Is it worth a speargun?

13:46.160 --> 13:47.440
Yes.

13:54.240 --> 13:55.440
Your brother?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.480
He died.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.480
In fact, we're closed for mourning.

14:03.320 --> 14:04.560
I'm sorry.

14:06.920 --> 14:09.280
You can give me a hug if you like.

14:17.400 --> 14:20.760
Has a girl come by, Anna,
with dark hair?

14:23.960 --> 14:25.040
No.

14:25.120 --> 14:27.760
You sure? She was after
a map of Sicily.

14:29.160 --> 14:32.560
Ah, Anna Salemi, sure!
I know her really well.

14:32.640 --> 14:34.280
She went to my school.

14:35.520 --> 14:36.800
Has she come by?

14:42.040 --> 14:44.120
I got some photos.

14:45.200 --> 14:49.160
- Photos?
- Of Anna's mom.

14:50.320 --> 14:53.160
Her name was Sonia Cavalcanti.

14:54.040 --> 14:57.440
Nude photos, Milanese photos.

14:57.520 --> 15:00.400
- You want to see them?
- No.

15:00.480 --> 15:03.120
I have to show them to you, come.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.400
Here they are.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.960
Look at those big tits.

16:01.040 --> 16:04.960
D'you see
who your Anna's mommy was?

16:05.040 --> 16:08.520
But she's blonde,
she's not like Anna at all.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.920
It says here she lives in Los Angeles.

16:14.040 --> 16:18.400
- Sure, Los Angeles is near Milan.
- Isn't it in America?

16:19.640 --> 16:21.720
Did Anna come by or not?

16:23.040 --> 16:25.520
Yeah, she came by,

16:25.600 --> 16:28.280
I gave her a map and she left.

16:28.360 --> 16:31.960
Do you want a map too?
For you it's free.

16:32.040 --> 16:35.200
Some candy too, a jar of caviar.

17:06.520 --> 17:09.600
Wow, all this stuff!
You sure liked the cow head.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.240
Yeah, yeah.

17:12.280 --> 17:16.520
If Anna comes back I'll say
you're looking for her.

17:16.640 --> 17:18.680
She's a very close friend,

17:18.760 --> 17:21.520
I even dated her for a while.

17:22.320 --> 17:24.280
You, too?

17:41.520 --> 17:43.600
Where's that music coming from?

17:45.360 --> 17:48.040
- What music?
- Can't you hear it?

17:52.800 --> 17:55.960
- Yeah, it's my brother.
- But isn't he dead?

17:56.040 --> 17:57.480
Yes... no!

17:59.360 --> 18:01.360
There's nothing here, it's my stuff.

18:02.680 --> 18:04.160
I swear.

18:04.240 --> 18:06.480
- Give me the key.
- I don't have it.

18:06.560 --> 18:08.280
My brother has it.

18:08.400 --> 18:09.960
Give it to me!

18:18.400 --> 18:20.320
What are you doing, dumbass?

18:23.560 --> 18:25.120
Magic.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.560
I'll open your belly like a pig
and get it back.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.200
Wait.

18:29.280 --> 18:32.240
There's another one, my brother's.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.600
Go and get it.

18:43.480 --> 18:44.680
Anna, are you there?

19:51.320 --> 19:54.000
I'll kill you!

19:54.080 --> 19:56.320
Let go of me!

20:02.960 --> 20:05.800
Now take me to the Blue Kids, okay?

20:07.960 --> 20:09.120
Come out.

20:12.760 --> 20:14.000
Stop!

20:16.760 --> 20:18.280
Get him!

20:18.720 --> 20:19.960
Let him go.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.480
He could have led me to Astor.

20:57.520 --> 21:01.040
It doesn't matter, we've got the map.

21:01.120 --> 21:02.720
But we've got to hurry.

21:03.960 --> 21:05.960
I'm not coming, I told you.

21:08.760 --> 21:10.520
Help me, these are enough for a year.

21:12.600 --> 21:16.240
Maybe you don't get it,
the Blue Kids took my brother

21:16.320 --> 21:18.480
and I'm getting him back.

21:18.560 --> 21:20.000
Wait.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.200
Let him go his own way.

21:22.320 --> 21:25.280
I'll never leave him,
get that into your head.

21:28.600 --> 21:31.200
Do you want him to see you die?

21:31.280 --> 21:33.200
What would you know?

21:34.200 --> 21:36.280
Who are you anyway?

21:36.400 --> 21:38.480
I saved you.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.920
Yeah, because you're like the twin,

21:41.000 --> 21:43.840
you saved me because
you're afraid of being alone.

21:43.920 --> 21:48.680
But I'm not your girlfriend
and I won't come and play wifey.

21:48.760 --> 21:52.000
Who wants you?
Go get him on your own!

21:52.080 --> 21:54.640
- That's it, walk away.
- Fuck you.

21:54.720 --> 21:57.160
Fuck you, you're a loser.

21:58.560 --> 21:59.760
Can I come with you?

22:17.480 --> 22:18.760
There are wafers too.

24:22.440 --> 24:25.040
Paola, what good thing
have you cooked?

24:25.120 --> 24:27.640
Pasta with zucchini and pancetta.

24:41.520 --> 24:44.320
Don't tell me you put onion in it.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.080
Yes, chef, I put peas in it too.

24:47.160 --> 24:50.640
I don't know
if you'll get through to the next round.

24:50.760 --> 24:53.280
And you, Lorenza, what did you cook?

24:53.360 --> 24:57.080
Pasta with fish,
meatballs and stock cubes.

24:57.160 --> 24:58.600
Interesting.

25:05.240 --> 25:07.440
You suck, both of you!

25:08.240 --> 25:11.440
Neither of you goes on
to the next episode.

25:12.360 --> 25:16.440
And now the penalty.

25:16.520 --> 25:18.920
What penalty?

25:19.040 --> 25:21.280
You have to eat your own dish.

25:22.160 --> 25:23.560
For real.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.560
Can I play with you?

25:29.880 --> 25:31.560
Why not?

25:31.640 --> 25:34.400
Because we're the Blonde Band.

25:35.280 --> 25:37.160
You're not all blonde.

25:37.240 --> 25:41.560
She's blonde,
we'll dye our hair blonde soon.

25:41.640 --> 25:44.520
Now get lost, scram!

25:44.600 --> 25:46.000
Wait.

25:49.200 --> 25:50.600
What's your background?

25:53.360 --> 25:54.680
Who's your father?

25:56.080 --> 25:58.160
Salvatore the plumber.

26:00.200 --> 26:02.520
Salvatore the plumber.

26:02.600 --> 26:06.480
To get into the Blonde Band
you've got to pass a challenge.

26:06.560 --> 26:09.080
But she can't join our band.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.680
Are you ready for the test?

26:14.000 --> 26:15.480
Good.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.360
If you want to join the band,

26:21.320 --> 26:24.960
you've got to jump like
on "Celebrity Island", got it?

26:26.320 --> 26:29.360
- What was your name again?
- Lucia.

26:29.440 --> 26:32.640
Got it, Lucia?
You got to pass the immunity challenge.

26:33.760 --> 26:36.040
The immunity challenge.

26:36.120 --> 26:38.520
You want to be in the band?

26:39.520 --> 26:42.640
Grab the rope and jump, it's easy.

26:44.200 --> 26:47.360
You've got to jump and grab the rope.

26:51.520 --> 26:55.200
- It's too far.
- No, it's really easy!

26:57.400 --> 26:59.280
You've got to jump.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.400
But I'm scared.

27:04.200 --> 27:06.360
What a pity,

27:06.480 --> 27:08.560
you're just a wimp.

27:11.240 --> 27:13.200
Go on, you can do it.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.000
Angelica, it's dangerous.

27:16.440 --> 27:21.480
It has to be dangerous
if you want to join the Blonde Band!

27:21.560 --> 27:26.520
- If she jumps, she'll get hurt.
- So? She asked for it.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.160
Right?

27:28.240 --> 27:30.200
Now jump!

27:30.280 --> 27:31.600
Angelica, please.

27:35.240 --> 27:37.720
Go.

27:37.800 --> 27:41.320
Show these two idiots you can do it,
you're special.

29:16.720 --> 29:20.600
Couldn't I have worn the floral one?
This uniform is gross.

29:20.680 --> 29:23.960
Quiet, I don't want to hear a word.

29:24.040 --> 29:26.280
She's a child.

29:26.360 --> 29:29.960
Now, Angelica, be good in church,

29:30.080 --> 29:33.280
go to Lucia's parents
and bow your head to greet them.

29:33.360 --> 29:36.680
Yes, but this thing sucks
and blue doesn't suit me.

29:40.120 --> 29:43.600
I don't want to go
to this stupid funeral.

29:43.720 --> 29:45.960
She jumped into a hole.

29:46.040 --> 29:48.920
Who does something like that?
Only an idiot!

29:50.360 --> 29:52.560
We've raised an animal.

30:36.520 --> 30:38.480
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

30:38.560 --> 30:40.240
My condolences.

30:42.760 --> 30:44.720
Say hello to Mr. Marino and the family.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.240
I'm sorry.

30:57.640 --> 30:58.760
I'm sorry.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.520
Jesus favors children,

31:10.080 --> 31:13.320
He takes them on His knee and says:

31:16.040 --> 31:18.840
"Suffer the little children
to come unto me.

31:18.920 --> 31:21.760
And forbid them not."

31:21.840 --> 31:25.080
Children have more merits than us

31:26.000 --> 31:30.240
in the mysterious dynamics
of the Kingdom of Heaven,

31:31.520 --> 31:35.160
since their innate goodness

31:35.240 --> 31:38.520
leads them
to be an example before God.

31:39.800 --> 31:42.320
For every pure creature,

31:42.400 --> 31:45.840
image of the Redeemer,

31:45.920 --> 31:49.240
whom God called to Him before his time,

31:49.320 --> 31:52.080
like our beloved Lucia,

31:52.160 --> 31:54.440
there are dark creatures,

31:55.760 --> 31:59.080
subject to the germ of the Devil.

32:00.760 --> 32:04.520
Evil hides at times behind beauty,

32:05.640 --> 32:07.920
so that its nature

32:08.000 --> 32:11.880
remains invisible to reason.

32:13.680 --> 32:16.800
Now our children

32:16.880 --> 32:20.520
will pay tribute in song
to our beloved Lucia.

32:21.800 --> 32:24.240
Her favorite song.

34:25.200 --> 34:26.080
Score?

34:28.640 --> 34:30.160
Eight.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.280
Seven.

34:32.360 --> 34:36.160
A dive like that? Are you blind?

34:47.720 --> 34:49.560
Actually...

34:51.480 --> 34:54.440
you're right, I can do better.

34:54.520 --> 34:56.640
It was my turn, you've done four.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.800
It was unbelievable, I'm shattered.

35:00.680 --> 35:02.720
They kept me for hours at the airport

35:03.920 --> 35:07.200
because I wasn't wearing a mask.

35:08.160 --> 35:10.640
Masks are nowhere to be found.

35:10.720 --> 35:13.360
Thank God, I'm finally home.

35:13.440 --> 35:14.840
Watch me.

37:32.720 --> 37:35.680
"You're the most beautiful, Angelica."

37:35.760 --> 37:38.280
"Oh, thank you, my dear."

37:41.000 --> 37:44.160
"Madam, where did you buy that lipstick?

37:45.200 --> 37:47.000
It's simply gorgeous."

37:55.640 --> 37:57.720
"Yes, it's excellent quality.

38:00.080 --> 38:02.520
Indeed,

38:02.600 --> 38:04.960
red suits me."

38:13.080 --> 38:14.440
Angelica!

38:24.440 --> 38:26.480
Come down, Angelica.

38:45.320 --> 38:48.160
How cool, you came!

38:49.440 --> 38:54.080
Now there are no Grown-ups,
we can do whatever the fuck we want.

38:56.960 --> 38:59.160
Take whatever you like.

39:00.080 --> 39:01.960
It's all yours.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.560
Blue! Blue!

41:09.640 --> 41:11.240
Stand back!

41:17.520 --> 41:19.240
I brought this.

41:24.040 --> 41:25.600
Just this?

41:25.680 --> 41:27.160
And this.

41:33.920 --> 41:35.440
You can keep it.

41:38.360 --> 41:41.320
Get lost, don't waste my time
or yours either.

41:49.280 --> 41:51.320
What do you want? Get out.

41:55.880 --> 41:58.320
- But I have to come in.
- What did you bring?

42:00.320 --> 42:01.640
I've only got these.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.600
Batteries aren't enough, go away.

42:04.680 --> 42:07.040
But my brother's a Blue Kid.

42:07.120 --> 42:10.000
Who cares! Find something good to eat.

42:10.080 --> 42:11.520
Get lost.

42:13.480 --> 42:14.600
No, I have to come in.

42:14.720 --> 42:17.600
- Send her away, she's got nothing.
- Stop!

42:20.440 --> 42:22.880
Have you got the Red Fever?

42:22.960 --> 42:24.000
Sure?

42:30.880 --> 42:33.880
- What can you do?
- Nothing.

42:33.960 --> 42:35.600
Can you dance at least?

42:36.960 --> 42:38.160
I can sing.

42:42.360 --> 42:43.560
Come in.

42:46.360 --> 42:48.720
Stop!

42:48.800 --> 42:50.600
What's your name?

42:50.680 --> 42:51.840
Anna.

42:54.760 --> 42:58.160
- What are you doing?
- She's here for Angelica.

42:59.440 --> 43:01.440
Give me those batteries.

43:01.560 --> 43:05.640
We've already let in a ton
of people today, come back tomorrow!

43:52.480 --> 43:55.520
No, not slippers, I said heels.

43:55.600 --> 43:59.480
She's thin, I wouldn't put heels on her.

43:59.560 --> 44:03.920
You're crazy!
The heels are to highlight her legs.

44:04.040 --> 44:06.080
Let's take her T-shirt off.

44:09.360 --> 44:12.160
- Why are you dressing me like this?
- Quiet, it's nearly time.

44:12.240 --> 44:14.480
For what? Where am I going?

44:15.520 --> 44:17.920
No, here are some more.

44:18.000 --> 44:22.720
- They're too young.
- They could have told us.

44:24.680 --> 44:26.720
- They're already done.
- Oh, God.

44:30.600 --> 44:32.520
Getting off to a great start.

44:40.560 --> 44:42.760
- Let go of me!
- Move it!

44:57.520 --> 44:59.320
Go on, you idiot!

45:00.320 --> 45:01.280
C'mon!

45:14.000 --> 45:15.320
Hi.

45:16.160 --> 45:17.960
What's your name?

45:19.080 --> 45:20.240
Anna.

45:22.080 --> 45:24.120
Last name?

45:24.200 --> 45:25.560
Salemi.

45:29.560 --> 45:32.720
Come on, chill out, come forward.

45:34.160 --> 45:35.320
Come on.

45:38.600 --> 45:40.400
Like that.

45:43.320 --> 45:44.440
Good.

45:45.600 --> 45:48.320
What's your secret dream?

45:52.360 --> 45:55.080
Pretty, but she seems a bit dumb.

46:12.560 --> 46:14.200
You're so pretty.

46:21.480 --> 46:24.040
Where have you been all this time?

46:27.400 --> 46:30.120
Don't disappoint me.

46:30.200 --> 46:33.600
A round of applause for Anna Salemi!

46:34.760 --> 46:36.200
Music.

46:44.400 --> 46:45.600
Dance.

46:48.400 --> 46:50.000
Come on.

46:50.120 --> 46:51.600
Dance.

46:51.680 --> 46:53.200
Dance!

46:55.480 --> 46:58.400
If you don't dance
I'll throw you out the window.

47:01.360 --> 47:03.360
Can I sing?

47:03.440 --> 47:05.000
Of course you can.

47:06.320 --> 47:07.400
Sing.

47:10.080 --> 47:12.360
So, Anna's in the singer category!

47:14.720 --> 47:16.200
Turn it off.

47:21.440 --> 47:22.720
Sing.

47:25.600 --> 47:27.080
Sing.

47:36.040 --> 47:37.280
Louder.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.560
You're amazing, Anna.

48:33.640 --> 48:36.760
You've got the X factor,
you'll kiss the Little Lady.

49:58.400 --> 50:00.160
Wait!

50:03.200 --> 50:05.600
Wait before you give them to us.

50:14.280 --> 50:16.200
What are you doing here?

50:16.320 --> 50:19.200
You're a dancer,
you're still not ready, hurry up!

50:52.320 --> 50:54.200
Perfect for tonight.

51:26.520 --> 51:27.760
Lights!

51:35.360 --> 51:36.440
Lights!

51:42.120 --> 51:43.480
Music!

52:37.400 --> 52:40.200
So, do you want to grow up?

52:40.280 --> 52:41.400
Yeah!

52:42.480 --> 52:46.000
- Do you want to become like me?
- Yeah!

52:46.080 --> 52:49.160
Do you want to get rid of the Red Fever?

52:53.240 --> 52:56.720
Are you ready to see the Little Lady?

53:00.160 --> 53:02.840
Are you ready to see the Grown-up?

53:02.920 --> 53:04.920
I didn't hear you! Are you ready?
