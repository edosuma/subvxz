WEBVTT

00:04.538 --> 00:06.974
Hey. They got
a new kind of grape.

00:07.007 --> 00:09.710
Says it tastes
just like cotton candy.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.381
Mmm!

00:13.414 --> 00:16.016
That would make a
fantastic wine.

00:16.050 --> 00:17.885
Kids would love it.

00:17.918 --> 00:18.986
Hey, Virginia.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.154
I don't want
to ruin your day,

00:20.188 --> 00:21.889
but your dad's back in town.

00:21.922 --> 00:23.924
What? Ugh!
That sucks.

00:23.957 --> 00:26.260
And I was so excited
about the grape thing.

00:26.294 --> 00:28.496
Life's a roller coaster.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.198
JIMMY: Recently, Mom found out
that her dad took off

00:30.231 --> 00:32.266
when she was little,
because he was a gay man

00:32.300 --> 00:34.535
living in a small-minded town.

00:34.568 --> 00:37.871
She also learned he had
secretly watched her grow up.

00:37.905 --> 00:41.242
Daddy!
But after reuniting, she found
out something else about him:

00:41.275 --> 00:42.943
he's a jerk.

00:42.976 --> 00:45.513
Forgive me for trying
to raise you to a higher level.

00:45.546 --> 00:46.714
I think you should leave.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.182
Good-bye forever.

00:48.216 --> 00:49.717
And since that day,

00:49.750 --> 00:51.919
my mom's wanted nothing
to do with him.

00:51.952 --> 00:53.721
He's been in here all morning
doing dramatic readings

00:53.754 --> 00:55.289
of the Father's Day cards.

00:55.323 --> 00:58.226
"Have an udder-ly fabulous
Father's Day."

00:58.259 --> 00:59.593
And then, see,

00:59.627 --> 01:01.729
it has a picture
of the aforementioned cow.

01:01.762 --> 01:02.896
Can you see that?

01:02.930 --> 01:04.565
And then, look what he's doing.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.767
He's playing... he's playing
ball with a smaller cow.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.536
Touching, right?

01:08.569 --> 01:10.204
Well, he should read
the sympathy cards

01:10.238 --> 01:12.406
because our
relationship is dead.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.142
Maybe we should talk to him.
(groans)

01:14.175 --> 01:16.043
We know what it's like
to have an ungrateful child.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.711
And an uncoordinated child.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.414
And an underachieving child.
But we stuck around.

01:20.448 --> 01:22.216
Hey, Mom. I'm right here.

01:22.250 --> 01:23.817
And a child
with an annoying voice.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.419
BARNEY (over P.A.):
Attention, Howdy's shoppers,

01:25.453 --> 01:26.920
I have two announcements.

01:26.954 --> 01:29.290
One, I have
a lost daddy up here

01:29.323 --> 01:31.058
looking for his family.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.762
And, two, I need a price check
on how to forgive your father.

01:34.795 --> 01:36.730
Forget it! I already
forgave him once

01:36.764 --> 01:38.966
and he burned all of us.
We don't need him.

01:38.999 --> 01:40.768
Love your dad.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.470
Love your dad.

01:42.503 --> 01:44.605
Love your dad.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.507
PATRONS:
Love your dad.

01:46.540 --> 01:50.444
ALL (chanting):
Love your dad. Love your dad.

01:50.478 --> 01:51.979
Love your dad.

01:52.012 --> 01:53.614
All right, fine!

01:53.647 --> 01:55.249
I'll talk to him.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.485
Yes!
(applause)

01:57.518 --> 01:59.187
Got your price check, Barney.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.822
How to Forgive Your Father
by Deborah Hitler.

02:01.855 --> 02:04.458
It's on sale for $7.99.

02:05.326 --> 02:07.195
Whoo!

02:07.228 --> 02:08.662
* Here we go

02:08.696 --> 02:11.999
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

02:12.032 --> 02:14.168
(chanting softly)

02:17.671 --> 02:19.807
(chanting)

02:21.742 --> 02:24.144
Ethnomusicologists sure know
how to apologize.

02:24.178 --> 02:25.679
I'm sorry. It's this way.

02:25.713 --> 02:28.316
(chanting)

02:30.518 --> 02:33.521
This is called
the Toltec Apology Dance.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.623
What I'm trying to do
in these moves, you see,

02:35.656 --> 02:36.724
this is change.

02:36.757 --> 02:39.493
I'm changing.

02:39.527 --> 02:40.828
And this is love.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.363
I'm in love.

02:42.396 --> 02:43.897
Right. With yourself.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.032
'Cause you're
a "narpolist..."

02:45.065 --> 02:46.066
narcolippt...

02:46.099 --> 02:47.067
nars...

02:47.100 --> 02:48.869
Narcissist, Jimmy.
(groans)

02:48.902 --> 02:51.572
I hate it when people try to use
words they can't pronounce.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.006
I've met someone.

02:53.040 --> 02:56.043
I've met someone even more
special than myself.

02:56.076 --> 02:58.479
His name is Oliver and we're
gonna get married and I want...

02:58.512 --> 03:00.548
I want you very much,
all of you,

03:00.581 --> 03:03.417
to attend, especially since I
told him I'm gonna have a big

03:03.451 --> 03:06.520
hometown wedding and that you...
you are actually planning it.

03:06.554 --> 03:07.588
What?

03:07.621 --> 03:08.556
Well, I... I don't know

03:08.589 --> 03:09.590
how to plan a wedding.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.191
I never thought I'd need to.

03:11.225 --> 03:13.327
The Supreme Court
really screwed me.

03:13.361 --> 03:16.564
Sorry, but there is nothing
in this world

03:16.597 --> 03:18.532
that could get me to do that.

03:18.566 --> 03:20.901
How 'bout if I were to pay
for Hope's college education?

03:20.934 --> 03:22.536
Nice try.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.071
Still no.

03:24.104 --> 03:27.908
Would you excuse us
for a moment?

03:27.941 --> 03:29.610
Come on, Mom.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.545
This could change Hope's future.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.213
They make a good point,
Virginia.

03:33.247 --> 03:34.615
Let's go tell Arnold we're in.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.116
No way. He's just trying
to manipulate us

03:36.149 --> 03:37.718
into getting something he wants.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.420
You can't argue with that,
Jimmy.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.689
Your mom knows her absent
father as well as any of us.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.190
We're not doing this.
Case closed.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.858
Hope needs to go to college.
Look, she needs

03:44.892 --> 03:47.895
to expand her horizons and
start thinking for herself

03:47.928 --> 03:49.430
and not just become somebody
who agrees

03:49.463 --> 03:50.798
with the last thing she heard.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.065
Sabrina's right.

03:52.099 --> 03:53.601
Hope should learn to
think for herself,

03:53.634 --> 03:54.735
not just become someone
who agrees

03:54.768 --> 03:55.936
with the last thing she heard.

03:55.969 --> 03:57.104
MAW MAW: Arnold...
(racks shotgun)

03:57.137 --> 03:59.139
...get the hell off my lawn!

03:59.172 --> 04:01.074
Maw Maw,
put the gun down.

04:01.108 --> 04:02.310
Don't worry, Arnold.

04:02.343 --> 04:03.777
We had the firing pin
removed after

04:03.811 --> 04:05.713
the piÃ±ata incident at
Hope's birthday party.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.114
Got my eyes on you, mister.

04:07.147 --> 04:08.081
Everything is

04:08.115 --> 04:09.082
milky and blurred,

04:09.116 --> 04:11.084
but I can make out shapes,

04:11.118 --> 04:13.053
and yours is shifty.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.723
I agree. And as much as I'd like
to believe that he'll pay

04:15.756 --> 04:18.292
for Hope's college, I kind of
wish we'd let Maw Maw shoot him.

04:18.326 --> 04:19.427
You know, I'm serious
about this,

04:19.460 --> 04:20.794
and I'll put it in writing.

04:20.828 --> 04:22.095
You know a good lawyer?

04:22.129 --> 04:23.397
We know a lawyer.

04:23.431 --> 04:25.499
And that's how I got
the nickname

04:25.533 --> 04:27.901
Wally "Chocolate Thunder"
Phipps.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.637
JIMMY:
Well, thanks again
for coming straight

04:29.670 --> 04:32.440
from your basketball game to
write up this contract, Wally.

04:32.473 --> 04:33.574
Luckily for you,

04:33.607 --> 04:35.443
I always keep a boilerplate

04:35.476 --> 04:38.846
marine vessel purchase contract
in my gym bag.

04:38.879 --> 04:41.482
So, we plan a great
wedding for him

04:41.515 --> 04:43.951
and he pays for
Hope's college.
Yep.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.119
You'll see in paragraph 12,

04:46.153 --> 04:50.524
right after the section
on international waters,

04:50.558 --> 04:53.794
the provision clearly states...

04:53.827 --> 04:55.195
Damn!

04:55.228 --> 04:56.764
I gotta get
the prescription

04:56.797 --> 04:58.766
on these rec specs checked.
Uh...

04:58.799 --> 05:01.635
"all parties agree that if said
wedding should prove seaworthy

05:01.669 --> 05:04.037
"and payment is not made,
party A

05:04.071 --> 05:05.873
"will surrender his deed
to his fabulous

05:05.906 --> 05:08.509
"Sedona condominium
to party B

05:08.542 --> 05:11.278
to cover college expenses
and docking fees."

05:11.311 --> 05:13.313
Ironclad.

05:13.347 --> 05:14.815
This is amazing.

05:14.848 --> 05:17.117
Hope's gonna be the first
Chance to go to college.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.553
Yeah. And she'll have the money
to afford a good one, too.

05:19.587 --> 05:21.154
Nothing with the words
"Tech," "State"

05:21.188 --> 05:22.956
or "Arizona" in the name.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.825
All right. We got to get going.
We have a wedding in three days.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.661
Three days?
What? We can't plan
this in three days.

05:27.695 --> 05:28.862
Well, you're gonna have to.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.531
Oliver's gonna be here
in three days.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.065
Wait, where does
it say that?

05:32.099 --> 05:34.402
What did you think it meant
when you agreed that

05:34.435 --> 05:39.039
"transaction must be completed
in less than 96 bells"?

05:40.841 --> 05:43.677
You people either need
to brush up on your maritime law

05:43.711 --> 05:46.013
or find a real lawyer.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.254
Ugh.
Where the hell is it?

05:54.287 --> 05:56.890
This is terrible. Hope's never
gonna go to college.

05:56.924 --> 05:59.226
We don't know anything
about planning a wedding.

05:59.259 --> 06:00.928
Oh, I can pull
off a wedding.

06:00.961 --> 06:03.063
I've been planning this
since I was a little girl.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.598
You've been planning
your estranged gay father's

06:04.632 --> 06:06.366
backyard wedding
since you were a little girl?

06:06.400 --> 06:09.737
No. I've been planning
a wedding fit for a princess,

06:09.770 --> 06:11.439
which is close enough.

06:11.472 --> 06:15.709
Wow. Wedding Extravaganza
Dream Book.

06:17.945 --> 06:19.913
We got three days,
Arnold's credit card

06:19.947 --> 06:22.115
and a dream wedding planned
by an eight-year-old.

06:22.149 --> 06:24.452
What could possibly go wrong?

06:27.421 --> 06:29.423
(bell dings)

06:30.624 --> 06:32.726
I've come here
because I've heard

06:32.760 --> 06:34.962
you are a professional stalker.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.431
I said
I'm a professional stocker.

06:37.465 --> 06:39.533
As in, I stock shelves.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.034
Also,

06:41.068 --> 06:44.972
I do spy on people so...
continue.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.808
Arnold, Virginia's dad,
is up to no good,

06:47.841 --> 06:52.546
and it's up to us to expose him
before it's too late.

06:52.580 --> 06:53.714
I'm in, Barbara June,

06:53.747 --> 06:55.483
mostly 'cause I
want an answer

06:55.516 --> 06:59.152
to the "will they or won't they"
that is our relationship.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.958
JIMMY:
With only three days
until Oliver arrived,

07:04.992 --> 07:07.394
the Wedding Extravaganza
Dream Book that Mom made

07:07.427 --> 07:10.230
as a little girl was going
to be Hope's ticket to college.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.466
(groans)
You guys.

07:12.500 --> 07:15.669
You just find a dead possum
in here, you don't pick it up?

07:15.703 --> 07:17.170
Come on!

07:17.204 --> 07:20.440
(possum chattering)
Oh, God. Not dead. Not dead!

07:20.474 --> 07:22.743
That's fantastic.
You have amazing taste.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.177
Really?
Mm-hmm.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.313
I was worried
you'd think it was tacky.

07:26.346 --> 07:27.748
How you gonna get Kenny Loggins?

07:27.781 --> 07:29.683
Oh, we won't.
But luckily Natesville has

07:29.717 --> 07:31.952
the most Kenny Loggins
impersonators per capita

07:31.985 --> 07:33.253
of any other 27-square-mile

07:33.286 --> 07:35.523
unincorporated township
in America.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.791
(Kenny Loggins' "Footloose"
begins)

07:44.632 --> 07:46.800
We've been slacking off
for four years,

07:46.834 --> 07:48.502
but now that we know
you're gonna have the money
to get to college,

07:48.536 --> 07:51.605
it's time for all
of us to get serious.

07:51.639 --> 07:54.141
Let's get you up
to your college height.

07:57.645 --> 07:59.379
Shoot.

08:00.380 --> 08:03.050
* Been working so hard

08:03.083 --> 08:05.152
* I'm punching my card

08:05.185 --> 08:07.287
* Eight hours...

08:07.320 --> 08:09.189
Okay. Hold real still.

08:10.524 --> 08:11.792
Smile.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.995
Congratulations,
Claudia Rosenbaum.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.497
* Holding me down...

08:20.367 --> 08:22.135
Is this really necessary?

08:22.169 --> 08:23.971
We have to make sure it's safe
for the guests at the wedding.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.038
What if it's not?

08:25.072 --> 08:27.675
Then we'll know.

08:31.712 --> 08:34.014
* Tonight I got to cut loose

08:34.047 --> 08:35.515
* Footloose...

08:35.549 --> 08:37.317
The key to surviving
a college food fight

08:37.350 --> 08:39.687
is to have ammo that can't
be thrown back at you

08:39.720 --> 08:41.488
and good aim.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.691
Here we go.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.394
Pretty good.

08:47.427 --> 08:50.898
Got to get a little
windup in, like this.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.366
Fling it.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.704
Yeah!

08:57.237 --> 08:58.772
Backhand.

09:00.407 --> 09:02.542
* Jack, turnin' it loose

09:02.576 --> 09:04.344
* Footloose

09:04.377 --> 09:06.914
* Get out your Sunday shoes

09:06.947 --> 09:09.717
* Everybody cut, everybody cut

09:09.750 --> 09:12.753
* Everybody cut,
everybody cut *

09:12.786 --> 09:14.421
* Everybody cut, everybody cut

09:14.454 --> 09:18.592
* Everybody *
* Everybody cut footloose.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.566
Thank you.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.069
What is this?

09:29.102 --> 09:30.070
Oh, this.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.872
This is
Oliver's harp.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.708
He just wants to play something
at the... at the wedding.

09:34.742 --> 09:36.409
He's a very good
hip-hop harpist.

09:36.443 --> 09:37.711
Mm.

09:37.745 --> 09:38.779
Hey, guys,

09:38.812 --> 09:39.780
Hope's all ready for college.

09:39.813 --> 09:40.948
Check out what she can do.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.616
Throw your hat.

09:43.617 --> 09:45.252
Huh?

09:45.786 --> 09:47.254
(chuckles)

09:47.287 --> 09:48.756
She can't make it freeze
in the air yet,

09:48.789 --> 09:50.223
but we got plenty of time.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.459
It's like seeing 18 years
into the future.

09:52.492 --> 09:54.762
You know, I know, um,
you're only doing this

09:54.795 --> 09:56.396
because I bribed you.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.933
But I got to tell you,
I am so touched.

09:59.967 --> 10:04.104
And I-I'm having so much
fun with you, honey.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.139
I've had fun, too.

10:06.173 --> 10:09.576
I guess you really have changed.

10:09.609 --> 10:12.512
Get your hands
off my granddaughter!

10:12.545 --> 10:14.614
That man is a lying sack
of garbage.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.616
And we've got the proof.

10:18.652 --> 10:20.587
By the way, I'm Frank.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.823
We met briefly,
last time you were here.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.591
Oh, yes, I remember.
Hi, Frank.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.326
Pleasure.

10:30.563 --> 10:32.299
As you will see from
this footage, Arnold is

10:32.332 --> 10:34.034
a lying,
manipulative,

10:34.067 --> 10:35.635
deceitful monster.

10:35.669 --> 10:37.637
ARNOLD (on video): Yeah, yeah.
(chuckles)

10:37.671 --> 10:38.872
Uh-huh.

10:38.906 --> 10:41.441
No, no.
It's-it's going perfectly.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.310
They have no idea
that the wedding is fake

10:43.343 --> 10:45.112
and that Oliver doesn't exist.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.880
I said

10:46.914 --> 10:48.982
(loudly):
Oliver does not ex...

10:49.016 --> 10:51.518
Forget it. I'll text you.

10:51.551 --> 10:54.487
One lousy cell tower
for the whole town.

10:54.521 --> 10:55.789
Is this true?

10:55.823 --> 10:57.390
Were you lying?

10:57.424 --> 11:00.460
Well, I guess, uh, it's time
for me to expose myself.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.862
Oh, God.

11:01.895 --> 11:04.798
Physically, I've always been
about an eight,

11:04.832 --> 11:07.500
but, um...
as a father, I've...

11:07.534 --> 11:09.502
I've been a zero.
I wasn't there for you.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.171
I certainly wasn't
there to throw you

11:11.204 --> 11:13.040
the wedding of your dreams.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.808
Because if I had been,

11:14.842 --> 11:16.509
it would have been just like

11:16.543 --> 11:19.146
the wedding you're planning
for tomorrow...

11:19.179 --> 11:21.148
because this wedding

11:21.181 --> 11:22.382
is for you.

11:22.415 --> 11:23.884
Oh, sure it is.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.385
You know what?
You're just trying...

11:25.418 --> 11:28.388
And this... is for you.

11:28.421 --> 11:31.691
Oh, my God... (gasps)

11:36.396 --> 11:38.531
It's Princess Diana's dress.

11:38.565 --> 11:39.699
(gasps)

11:39.733 --> 11:41.568
How did you know?

11:41.601 --> 11:43.503
ARNOLD:
Just because I wasn't
part of your life,

11:43.536 --> 11:45.705
doesn't mean I didn't keep you
as a part of mine.

11:45.739 --> 11:47.607
I saw you watch
the royal wedding.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.943
Often, when I came
into town to spy on you

11:49.977 --> 11:51.745
like a loving father,
you would be working

11:51.779 --> 11:54.214
on that scrapbook
and watching that videotape.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.416
Until one day you weren't.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.058
When I saw you
give up your dream,

12:05.092 --> 12:06.559
it broke my heart.

12:06.593 --> 12:08.261
I have always loved you...

12:08.295 --> 12:10.563
Oh...
...and you've always
loved the dress.

12:12.465 --> 12:13.901
Burt...

12:13.934 --> 12:15.102
(sniffs)

12:15.135 --> 12:17.270
...we're gonna have a wedding.

12:19.907 --> 12:22.242
ARNOLD:
Oh, my, my, my, my.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.611
There's
my princess.

12:24.644 --> 12:25.779
Here you go, pretty.

12:25.813 --> 12:28.081
You ready?
Yeah.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.452
JIMMY: Mom finally got
the royal wedding

12:32.485 --> 12:34.087
she had always dreamed of.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.456
*

12:36.489 --> 12:37.891
And it even came with a replica

12:37.925 --> 12:39.893
of Princess Diana's
25-foot train--

12:39.927 --> 12:41.929
a train that Hope
would eventually ride

12:41.962 --> 12:43.931
all the way to college.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.002
(quietly):
This way.

12:49.036 --> 12:51.171
Oh, my...

13:01.882 --> 13:04.351
"Burt, when I was 14,

13:04.384 --> 13:07.087
"I was majorly in love
with Mark Johnson.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.788
"But now that
I'm 15

13:08.822 --> 13:10.157
"and Mark moved,

13:10.190 --> 13:12.425
"I realize I know

13:12.459 --> 13:13.927
you're the one, forever."

13:13.961 --> 13:16.163
(guests gasp and murmur
with delight)

13:17.898 --> 13:20.100
"Virginia, you are
the coolest girl

13:20.133 --> 13:21.368
"I've ever known.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.436
"If anyone ever
hurts you,

13:23.470 --> 13:25.973
I'll punch them in the face."

13:26.006 --> 13:27.340
Still holds.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.778
Now by the power
vested in me by no one--

13:31.811 --> 13:33.680
uh, because this is

13:33.713 --> 13:36.149
my Halloween costume
from three years ago--

13:36.183 --> 13:37.150
(guests chuckle)

13:37.184 --> 13:38.785
I now pronounce you:

13:38.818 --> 13:41.188
still man and wife.

13:42.522 --> 13:45.525
(cheering)

13:52.699 --> 13:54.868
(cannons boom, guests gasp)

14:09.716 --> 14:11.151
It is with great honor

14:11.184 --> 14:12.986
that Jazzoo will now present

14:13.020 --> 14:14.854
Kenny Loggins' classic hit...

14:14.888 --> 14:16.389
Excuse me, guys.

14:16.423 --> 14:19.092
Um... while kazoo is not

14:19.126 --> 14:21.528
the most annoying
instrument in the world--

14:21.561 --> 14:25.165
that, uh, honor goes to
the aboriginal torture flute--

14:25.198 --> 14:28.368
I had something else in mind.

14:30.270 --> 14:31.238
(gasps)

14:31.271 --> 14:32.872
Uh...
is it...
(gasps)

14:32.906 --> 14:34.007
Oh, my God.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.042
We're going to perform

14:35.075 --> 14:36.443
with Kenny Loggins!

14:36.476 --> 14:38.912
Sorry, guys,
I'm kind of a solo act now.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.113
But you don't even have

14:40.147 --> 14:41.748
the classic Loggins
hair and beard.

14:41.781 --> 14:44.084
Uh, that's because
it's not the '80s.

14:44.117 --> 14:46.053
In Natesville,
it's always the '80s.

14:49.256 --> 14:50.790
Holy crap!

14:50.823 --> 14:52.892
Footloose dance party
is actually happening!

14:52.926 --> 14:54.194
Yeah!

14:54.227 --> 14:55.562
Um, maybe in a little bit,

14:55.595 --> 14:57.030
but I got a tip from somebody...

14:57.064 --> 14:58.365
Me, it was me.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.133
...that the bride
and groom might like

15:00.167 --> 15:02.135
another one of my songs
for their first dance.

15:02.169 --> 15:03.603
Play "Fight
This Feeling"!

15:03.636 --> 15:05.905
Uh, I think
that's R.E.O. Speedwagon.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.207
I know.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.708
It's just a simple
chord progression.

15:08.741 --> 15:09.977
Can't you
just play it?

15:12.279 --> 15:14.247
(playing "Danny's Song")

15:19.119 --> 15:21.921
* People smile and tell me

15:21.955 --> 15:24.491
* I'm the lucky one...

15:24.524 --> 15:26.759
JIMMY:
I requested this song

15:26.793 --> 15:28.261
because it reminded me
of the first day

15:28.295 --> 15:29.596
I brought Hope home.

15:29.629 --> 15:32.065
I had no idea what to do.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.766
But when Mom and Dad
sang this song

15:33.800 --> 15:35.568
to get Hope to sleep,

15:35.602 --> 15:38.238
they also gave me my first
lesson in being a parent.

15:38.271 --> 15:41.308
* Conceived in love

15:41.341 --> 15:44.777
* Sun is gonna shine above

15:46.213 --> 15:49.016
* Even though
we ain't got money *

15:49.049 --> 15:52.019
* I'm so in love with you,
honey... *

15:52.052 --> 15:53.520
JIMMY:
Now everything was perfect.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.122
Excuse me...
(clears throat)

15:55.155 --> 15:56.456
May we cut in?

15:56.489 --> 15:58.191
Oh, well...

15:58.225 --> 16:01.194
I would love to dance with
this pretty little college girl.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.599
Thanks, Dad.

16:06.633 --> 16:09.002
This was even better than
I could possibly dream.

16:09.036 --> 16:11.838
I told you I wanted
everything perfect.

16:11.871 --> 16:14.674
I just wish I could've
sent you on your...

16:14.707 --> 16:16.776
your dream honeymoon
from your scrapbook.

16:16.809 --> 16:17.977
That's okay.

16:18.011 --> 16:19.679
I think that cool
murdering whale

16:19.712 --> 16:23.150
got sent to some marine park
in South America, anyway.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.685
(chuckles)

16:25.718 --> 16:27.820
Although...

16:27.854 --> 16:29.556
if you wanted to let us stay

16:29.589 --> 16:32.692
in your condo in Sedona
for a few days...

16:32.725 --> 16:34.461
Yeah. We-we'd love
to drive up there.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.828
Or down there.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.964
Or fly, or sail...

16:37.997 --> 16:40.033
All right, we don't know
where Sedona is.

16:40.067 --> 16:41.801
But we'd still love
to come stay there.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.170
Yeah, that, uh...

16:43.203 --> 16:44.637
that, uh, that would be, uh...

16:44.671 --> 16:45.838
great, at some point.

16:45.872 --> 16:47.640
What do you mean,
"at some point"?

16:47.674 --> 16:49.509
Well...
(clears throat)

16:49.542 --> 16:51.644
...the condo is, uh...

16:51.678 --> 16:55.014
sort of out of my hands,
at this point.

16:55.048 --> 16:57.084
And whose hands would the condo

16:57.117 --> 16:59.686
that's supposed to pay
for Hope's college be in?

16:59.719 --> 17:03.190
The people I sold... it to...

17:03.223 --> 17:04.757
t-to pay for this wedding.

17:04.791 --> 17:07.660
* I'm so in love
with you, honey *

17:07.694 --> 17:09.196
(guests exclaim)
* And everything will bring...

17:09.229 --> 17:10.097
(stops playing)

17:10.130 --> 17:12.565
Sorry. I had to.

17:12.599 --> 17:15.735
I just vowed to punch
anyone who hurt Virginia.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.442
VIRGINIA:
What do you mean you can't
pay for Hope's college?

17:22.475 --> 17:24.377
She was going to be the
first one in our family

17:24.411 --> 17:25.945
who didn't have to scrub
toilets, mow lawns

17:25.978 --> 17:27.380
or bag groceries
for a living.

17:27.414 --> 17:28.881
I fully intend to...

17:28.915 --> 17:31.351
figure out a way to pay
for Hope's education.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.619
I just...
I-I might have to

17:32.652 --> 17:35.855
wait for the
ethnomusicology business

17:35.888 --> 17:37.724
to just perk up just
a little bit, it's...

17:37.757 --> 17:39.025
Maybe it'll be better

17:39.058 --> 17:40.693
if-if we all work
on this together.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.195
You know,
we're her parents.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.764
We can figure out
a way to pay for this,

17:44.797 --> 17:46.899
even if it means
saving $1,000 a year.

17:46.933 --> 17:48.701
That should
cover it, right?

17:48.735 --> 17:50.203
Yeah, if you're talking about
the boob job she'd need

17:50.237 --> 17:51.638
in order to pole-dance
her way through college.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.073
You know, I think
the salient point

17:54.107 --> 17:56.243
was succinctly covered

17:56.276 --> 17:57.577
in Mr. Loggins' refrain:

17:57.610 --> 17:59.879
"Even though we ain't got money,

17:59.912 --> 18:03.583
we are so much in love
with each other, honey."

18:05.118 --> 18:07.887
I packed your crap. (sighs)

18:07.920 --> 18:09.889
You can go.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.058
(laughing)

18:12.091 --> 18:15.595
I... I have no place to go.

18:16.963 --> 18:18.431
(crying)

18:18.465 --> 18:20.300
Arnold can have
my old room.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.334
What?!

18:21.368 --> 18:23.270
You guys said,
just last week,

18:23.303 --> 18:25.238
that room was still mine

18:25.272 --> 18:27.407
if-if things didn't
work out with Sabrina.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.242
Really. Just last week?

18:29.276 --> 18:31.578
It was your anniversary,
the subject came up...

18:31.611 --> 18:33.180
And to be clear,
he had just told us

18:33.213 --> 18:34.614
he was getting you
a box of envelopes.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.283
The first anniversary
is paper.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.285
Uh, not to make this about me,

18:38.318 --> 18:39.419
but, uh,
what Jimmy said

18:39.452 --> 18:40.587
about the, uh, room...

18:40.620 --> 18:41.854
being available...

18:41.888 --> 18:43.656
is that still on the table?
No.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.658
Okay, I just...

18:45.692 --> 18:48.328
Arnold lied to us
and tricked us,

18:48.361 --> 18:50.263
did all that crazy stuff...
but if you think about it,

18:50.297 --> 18:51.964
that's kind of how
our family shows love.

18:51.998 --> 18:54.167
Maybe we ought to
give him a chance.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.669
Having Hope turned me

18:56.703 --> 18:58.004
into a better person.

18:58.037 --> 19:00.507
If you really want him
to be a better father,

19:00.540 --> 19:02.475
you're going to have
to give him a chance

19:02.509 --> 19:04.143
at having a daughter.

19:04.177 --> 19:05.512
Jimmy...

19:05.545 --> 19:07.113
that was really beautiful.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.648
Most of it was from one
of the Father's Day cards

19:08.681 --> 19:09.716
Arnold performed
at Howdy's.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.551
And I did get to punch somebody

19:11.584 --> 19:13.052
to Kenny Loggins' music.

19:13.085 --> 19:14.654
That puts me in
an exclusive club

19:14.687 --> 19:16.022
with Tom Cruise
and Kevin Bacon.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.492
Not to rush your decision,
but, um...

19:19.526 --> 19:20.960
there's an opportunity

19:20.993 --> 19:24.497
for an incredibly sweet
father-daughter moment

19:24.531 --> 19:26.899
dancing to
Kenny Loggins' song.

19:26.933 --> 19:30.002
And we only have Kenny
for two more minutes.

19:30.036 --> 19:31.538
I'm tempted just to kill you,

19:31.571 --> 19:32.872
'cause then
I could use

19:32.905 --> 19:34.874
my Funeral Extravaganza
Dream Book.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.378
But I guess it's easier
just to forgive you.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.214
Oh, baby...

19:44.083 --> 19:45.652
All right, well,

19:45.685 --> 19:47.220
it's been a very
costly 15 minutes

19:47.254 --> 19:49.422
while everyone has been
processing their feelings,

19:49.456 --> 19:51.824
but I'd really like
to finish "Danny's Song."

19:51.858 --> 19:54.561
Uh, if I don't,
it just keeps going around

19:54.594 --> 19:56.529
in my head and drives me crazy.

19:56.563 --> 19:59.499
(playing "Danny's Song")

19:59.532 --> 20:03.903
* People smile and tell me
I'm the lucky one *

20:04.937 --> 20:08.241
* And we've just begun

20:08.275 --> 20:10.443
* Think I'm gonna have a son

20:13.212 --> 20:15.415
* He'll be like she and me

20:15.448 --> 20:18.518
* As free as a dove

20:18.551 --> 20:21.053
* Conceived in love

20:21.087 --> 20:23.923
* Sun is gonna shine above

20:25.992 --> 20:28.795
* Even though
we ain't got money *

20:28.828 --> 20:32.198
* I'm so in love with you,
honey *

20:32.231 --> 20:34.867
* And everything will bring

20:34.901 --> 20:39.772
* A chain of love

20:39.806 --> 20:42.208
* In the morning, when I rise

20:42.241 --> 20:45.945
* You bring a tear of joy
to my eyes *

20:45.978 --> 20:50.750
* And tell me everything

20:50.783 --> 20:53.920
* Is gonna be all right...

20:53.953 --> 20:56.956
JIMMY: Not everybody becomes
a parent at the perfect time.

20:56.989 --> 20:59.459
Some of us do it way too early,

20:59.492 --> 21:01.461
some of us do it way too late.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.463
The important thing is,

21:03.496 --> 21:05.097
when you get the chance,

21:05.131 --> 21:07.099
you make the most of it.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.902
What's that piece of
trash doing here?

21:09.936 --> 21:12.104
Oh...
No, no, no, no, no!

21:12.138 --> 21:14.173
No, no, no, no. Hey...
(anxious laugh)

21:14.206 --> 21:16.175
Is this going be happening
every five minutes

21:16.208 --> 21:17.977
after she leaves the room?

21:18.010 --> 21:19.946
No, eventually, she'll think
you're her dead husband

21:19.979 --> 21:21.481
and try to make
out with you.

21:21.514 --> 21:22.482
Okay, okay...

21:22.515 --> 21:24.317
How are you?
Good, good.

21:24.351 --> 21:26.419
Good...
I'm good.

21:26.453 --> 21:28.655
I'm good.
(others laughing)

21:32.559 --> 21:35.928
(indistinct talking)
What the hell?

21:35.962 --> 21:37.096
(boat horn honks)

21:37.129 --> 21:38.130
MAN:
Honey, I'm home.
