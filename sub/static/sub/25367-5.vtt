<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> "The Affair"...

00:23.199 --> 00:25.377
You look just like
your father, Cole.

00:25.444 --> 00:27.308
Always tell me that,
but I don't see it.

00:27.375 --> 00:30.740
Your grandfather, Silas,
was a terrible person, boys.

00:30.807 --> 00:32.900
He was a drunk.
He beat your dad.

00:32.967 --> 00:34.445
Oh, so that's
what it was.

00:34.512 --> 00:36.006
Dad had a rough childhood?

00:36.073 --> 00:37.558
That's what
was wrong with him?

00:37.625 --> 00:39.992
Not the fact that he
was a stumble-down drunk?

00:40.059 --> 00:42.674
Dad just disappeared
for six months?

00:42.741 --> 00:44.870
- What did he do?
- He went to California.

00:44.937 --> 00:48.148
To a town with a giant rock
in the middle of the sea.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.222
Six months later,
he came back

00:50.289 --> 00:51.744
with a surfboard.

00:51.811 --> 00:53.299
He seemed a little lighter.

00:53.366 --> 00:54.718
I think
you're giving up

00:54.785 --> 00:56.963
because we've made
a mess of everything.

00:57.068 --> 00:58.994
If you leave Luisa now,

00:59.061 --> 01:01.572
you can't play
the good guy anymore.

01:01.639 --> 01:04.033
Then you're an asshole,
just like me.

01:04.144 --> 01:05.737
I know I'm disappointing you.

01:05.804 --> 01:08.132
And you deserve better.
So, what if I left?

01:08.199 --> 01:09.664
Would you be willing
to give me the time

01:09.731 --> 01:12.242
to just go away and...

01:12.309 --> 01:13.506
Yes.

01:13.574 --> 01:14.972
I don't want this to end.

01:15.039 --> 01:17.056
I just need to know
that I matter.

01:18.477 --> 01:19.714
Do you think
she even realizes

01:19.781 --> 01:21.307
these cans are hers, not ours?

01:21.374 --> 01:23.311
No, I don't.
And she's not going to

01:23.378 --> 01:25.395
if you keep
moving 'em for her.

01:25.462 --> 01:26.723
I'm not getting treatment.

01:26.790 --> 01:27.972
That just doesn't
make any sense.

01:28.039 --> 01:30.383
I'm not gonna sit around
and watch you die.

01:30.450 --> 01:31.745
Believe it or not, Helen,

01:31.812 --> 01:33.646
you don't get
to make that choice.

01:33.713 --> 01:35.155
Vik is very sick,

01:35.222 --> 01:37.667
and he won't listen to me.
He's refusing treatment.

01:37.734 --> 01:40.347
I asked you not
to tell my parents,

01:40.414 --> 01:41.690
and what did you do?

01:41.757 --> 01:43.556
I had to.
She's your mother.

01:43.639 --> 01:45.628
I just...
just please, can we...

01:45.695 --> 01:47.588
- please make a plan?
- Okay.

01:47.657 --> 01:49.072
Let's have a baby.

01:50.242 --> 01:52.096
How's that for a plan?

03:16.312 --> 03:17.522
You have to go.

03:17.589 --> 03:18.742
I want to do it.

03:18.809 --> 03:20.596
Yeah, but you have to go.

03:23.157 --> 03:25.340
Wait.
Let me just wash my hands.

03:25.407 --> 03:26.771
You're gonna be late.

03:26.838 --> 03:28.834
- It's okay.
- I can do it.

03:28.901 --> 03:30.456
Helen, it'll take
two minutes.

03:30.523 --> 03:31.682
Yeah, I know, but I know

03:31.749 --> 03:33.054
how stressed-out you get
when you're late.

03:33.121 --> 03:34.866
Just... It's okay.

03:36.328 --> 03:37.663
- You sure?
- Yeah.

03:37.730 --> 03:39.451
I'll just do my upper thigh.

03:40.655 --> 03:42.343
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:43.490 --> 03:45.041
Hey, Vik.

03:46.320 --> 03:49.701
Uh, have your...
have your parents said anything?

03:50.970 --> 03:52.315
At all?

03:52.490 --> 03:54.068
About what?

03:57.151 --> 03:58.889
I'll see you later today
at Dr. Roper's?

03:58.956 --> 04:01.256
- Yep. I'll be there.
- Okay.

04:14.449 --> 04:17.173
Come on, hurry up.
I don't want to be late.

04:17.240 --> 04:19.450
Mom left me your lunch,
so I'll get that for you

04:19.517 --> 04:20.826
and then we got to go.

04:20.892 --> 04:22.128
Bye, guys!

04:22.196 --> 04:24.866
- Have good days!
- Bye, Vik!

04:25.394 --> 04:27.582
Hey, give me back my notebook.

04:58.097 --> 05:00.083
I'm telling you,
all the new immigrants

05:00.150 --> 05:03.858
from Lebanon, they have it
so much easier than we did.

05:03.925 --> 05:05.923
They go to the top right away.

05:05.990 --> 05:08.402
Like that Amal Clooney.

05:08.490 --> 05:11.494
She's not exactly
a new immigrant, Dad.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.304
Think she went to NYU.

05:14.673 --> 05:16.848
Does this really work?

05:17.329 --> 05:19.986
Yeah. It can read your
glucose values in real time.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.912
Why do you have to change it
every two weeks?

05:21.979 --> 05:23.273
That's so inconvenient.

05:23.340 --> 05:24.840
Or you could just go back

05:24.907 --> 05:26.554
to pricking your finger
once a day.

05:33.032 --> 05:35.411
Okay. You're good.

05:37.220 --> 05:38.729
I have this customer

05:38.796 --> 05:40.310
- who's a doctor.
- Mm-hmm.

05:40.377 --> 05:41.825
Have I told you
about him?

05:41.931 --> 05:43.869
You have, but he's not a doctor.

05:43.936 --> 05:45.499
He's a physician's assistant.

05:45.566 --> 05:47.864
Here, there is no difference.

05:48.443 --> 05:49.797
There is, in fact.

05:49.864 --> 05:51.720
He can write prescriptions.

05:51.787 --> 05:52.799
What about him?

05:52.866 --> 05:54.068
He says, in America,

05:54.135 --> 05:55.959
there's no art left
to medicine.

05:56.026 --> 05:59.396
It's basically just machines
doing the diagnosing.

05:59.463 --> 06:02.661
In a few years, there will be
no need for surgeons anymore.

06:02.948 --> 06:05.215
A robot will do your job.

06:05.574 --> 06:07.317
Things to think about.

06:10.032 --> 06:11.926
How's the Prius working out?

06:11.993 --> 06:13.794
It's a good car, right?

06:14.616 --> 06:15.735
Ah...

06:15.803 --> 06:17.033
You don't like it?

06:17.170 --> 06:19.158
Yeah, sure, I like
that it saves gas,

06:19.225 --> 06:21.355
but... sometimes
I want something

06:21.422 --> 06:23.752
with a little bit more zip,
you know. Power.

06:23.819 --> 06:25.248
Especially here
in L.A., you know.

06:25.315 --> 06:27.625
The bastards,
they cut me off all the time.

06:27.692 --> 06:28.722
What can I do?

06:28.789 --> 06:30.994
I got this little
putt-putt car.

06:31.061 --> 06:32.659
Yeah, what did you want, Dad?
A Porsche?

06:32.726 --> 06:34.809
Hey.
What's with the tone?

06:34.876 --> 06:36.231
You asked, I told you.

06:36.298 --> 06:38.307
- Why are you upset?
- I'm not upset.

06:38.374 --> 06:40.774
He's not upset.
You're the one who sounds upset.

06:40.841 --> 06:42.709
- I am not upset.
- Why can't you be

06:42.776 --> 06:45.099
more thankful to Vik
for taking care of us?

06:45.166 --> 06:46.758
Of course
I am thankful.

06:46.825 --> 06:47.994
He knows that.

06:48.061 --> 06:49.388
I'm just saying,
maybe we should

06:49.455 --> 06:51.497
have better
communication.

06:53.469 --> 06:54.648
Look.

06:57.164 --> 06:59.144
Speaking of communication,

06:59.404 --> 07:01.762
there are a few details
I want to go over.

07:02.448 --> 07:05.660
First, um,
about my life insurance.

07:06.436 --> 07:09.371
You should know,
it's about a million dollars,

07:09.438 --> 07:11.980
and you guys are
the beneficiaries.

07:18.157 --> 07:20.758
I've kept my overhead pretty low

07:20.825 --> 07:22.044
for most of my life.

07:22.111 --> 07:24.074
Until you met Helen.

07:25.705 --> 07:28.590
So I've got decent savings,

07:28.915 --> 07:30.558
all of which will go to you.

07:34.032 --> 07:36.637
Um, also...

07:37.180 --> 07:38.695
before I get too sick,

07:38.762 --> 07:40.363
I will make sure...

07:40.911 --> 07:42.133
What...

07:45.415 --> 07:47.489
Why do you have to be
so cruel, Vikram?

07:47.556 --> 07:49.224
- So heartless.
- What?

07:49.291 --> 07:51.386
We all heard
what Helen said.

07:51.453 --> 07:52.846
Do you think we're deaf?

07:52.949 --> 07:56.178
And now you have to go
and rub it in our faces?

08:10.948 --> 08:12.332
Listen, Ma.

08:12.890 --> 08:14.954
Helen and I are...

08:16.269 --> 08:18.316
We're working on having a baby.

08:20.156 --> 08:21.811
A grandchild.

08:22.878 --> 08:24.442
For you and Baba.

08:28.453 --> 08:30.804
Helen is too old to have a baby.

08:30.985 --> 08:32.254
No, actually,

08:32.321 --> 08:34.644
there are a lot
of new treatments now.

08:35.073 --> 08:37.566
Women are having children
well into their 50s.

08:38.282 --> 08:40.419
And we've been seeing
a fertility doctor

08:40.486 --> 08:41.458
for weeks.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.571
Hmm? Hmm?

09:09.974 --> 09:11.090
How is she?

09:11.157 --> 09:12.162
Is everything okay?

09:12.229 --> 09:13.821
The surgery went very smoothly.

09:13.888 --> 09:14.992
Now, Jenny's recovering.

09:15.059 --> 09:17.290
You should be able
to see her in about an hour.

09:18.324 --> 09:20.012
- Thank God.
- Thank you.

09:20.079 --> 09:22.407
Let's sit,
talk about next steps.

09:29.098 --> 09:31.840
Now, I did find tumors,

09:31.907 --> 09:33.492
which we are
sending away for tests.

09:33.559 --> 09:34.992
Wait. What does that mean?

09:35.059 --> 09:36.840
You-you said
everything went well.

09:36.907 --> 09:38.282
Well, until we get
the results back,

09:38.349 --> 09:39.770
there's no way of knowing
whether they're

09:39.837 --> 09:41.290
malignant or benign.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.825
M-Malignant
meaning what?

09:43.892 --> 09:45.557
Malignant
meaning cancer?

09:45.624 --> 09:47.493
We really don't know.

09:47.809 --> 09:50.102
But I'm going to be
honest with you.

09:50.407 --> 09:52.153
Jenny could have liver cancer.

09:52.220 --> 09:53.852
Now, I stress "could,"

09:53.919 --> 09:55.762
- because there's...
- No!

09:57.669 --> 10:00.772
Even if the tests
confirm malignancy,

10:00.839 --> 10:02.545
there are lots of good options.

10:02.612 --> 10:05.020
- No, no, no!
- Dr. Mattu in pediatric oncology

10:05.087 --> 10:07.126
is probably the best
in the country.

10:07.193 --> 10:07.803
- Honey.
- No!

10:07.870 --> 10:09.757
We'll set you up with a
consultation immediately,

10:09.824 --> 10:12.727
just in case,
so you understand the options.

10:13.376 --> 10:16.189
If this is worst-case scenario,

10:16.857 --> 10:17.908
these cancers...

10:17.975 --> 10:21.687
No! No!

10:21.755 --> 10:24.032
- No, no.
- Honey...

10:24.099 --> 10:26.626
- Please!
- These cancers...

10:27.396 --> 10:32.188
can be very specifically
targeted nowadays.

10:32.477 --> 10:34.428
It's not fair!

10:34.495 --> 10:36.045
She's just
a little girl!

10:36.112 --> 10:38.766
Honey, the doctor's saying
they don't know yet.

10:40.466 --> 10:44.657
Mr. Rodriguez,

10:44.724 --> 10:48.293
our social worker,
he is on the premises.

10:48.360 --> 10:50.771
No! No!

10:52.380 --> 10:56.073
No, no!

10:56.286 --> 10:57.940
No!

10:58.404 --> 10:59.575
Excuse me.

10:59.643 --> 11:01.915
No! Please!

11:18.657 --> 11:20.824
Have you been keeping up
on the injections?

11:21.032 --> 11:22.368
Yes, I have.

11:22.435 --> 11:24.415
Hopefully, this will
all be worth it.

11:26.032 --> 11:27.832
Let's take a look
at those follicles.

11:34.230 --> 11:35.438
Success?

11:37.719 --> 11:38.872
Why don't you get dressed,

11:38.939 --> 11:41.634
and we'll meet in my office
and discuss next steps.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.032
I'm sorry.

12:11.305 --> 12:14.418
Please, don't apologize.

12:14.733 --> 12:15.884
It's not your fault.

12:15.951 --> 12:17.324
Actually, it is.

12:17.961 --> 12:19.453
Stop.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.762
- Because of your age?
- No.

12:24.850 --> 12:26.855
I haven't been doing the shots.

12:29.265 --> 12:31.410
- What do you mean?
- What I just said.

12:32.063 --> 12:33.593
You haven't been
injecting yourself?

12:33.660 --> 12:35.840
No. Not all the time.

12:35.907 --> 12:37.296
Not as much as I'm
supposed to be.

12:37.363 --> 12:38.617
Helen.

12:39.531 --> 12:41.429
This is costing us 11 grand.

12:41.496 --> 12:42.449
I-I know.

12:42.517 --> 12:43.660
I don't understand.

12:43.727 --> 12:44.830
Well, I can't do it alone.

12:44.897 --> 12:45.927
You're not
doing it alone.

12:45.994 --> 12:46.986
I'm right here.

12:47.053 --> 12:48.130
I left work to be here.

12:48.197 --> 12:49.239
That's not
what I mean.

12:49.306 --> 12:52.808
Vik, a child is a lot of work.

12:52.990 --> 12:54.992
I want to give you
what you want...

12:55.059 --> 12:56.658
I really do...
But I can't

12:56.725 --> 12:59.606
go through that again
if you're not gonna be here.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.091
You fucking lied to me.

13:01.158 --> 13:02.809
I know. I'm sorry.

13:02.876 --> 13:05.168
I told my parents
we were having a baby.

13:05.235 --> 13:06.488
I don't know what to do
about your parents.

13:06.555 --> 13:07.915
- What is wrong with you?!
- If you want me

13:07.982 --> 13:09.810
to have your baby,
you have to at least try

13:09.877 --> 13:11.582
to be here with me
while I do it.

13:11.848 --> 13:13.502
Every single day, your odds

13:13.569 --> 13:16.078
of beating this thing
get less and less.

13:16.145 --> 13:17.617
We cannot waste any more time.

13:17.684 --> 13:19.324
We have to make some choices.

13:25.490 --> 13:26.578
I gotta get back to work.

13:26.645 --> 13:29.020
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

13:37.866 --> 13:39.426
<i>How is she?
Is everything okay?</i>

13:39.493 --> 13:40.601
<i>Well, I can't do it alone.</i>

13:40.668 --> 13:42.578
Afternoon, Dr. Ullah.
Busy day?

13:42.645 --> 13:44.387
They all are.

13:45.778 --> 13:47.816
<i>Helen is too old
to have a baby.</i>

13:47.883 --> 13:49.115
<i>I haven't been
doing the shots.</i>

13:49.182 --> 13:51.082
<i>Why do you have
to be so cruel, Vikram?</i>

13:51.149 --> 13:52.457
<i>- Success?
- So heartless.</i>

13:52.524 --> 13:53.723
<i>We cannot waste any more time.</i>

13:53.790 --> 13:56.055
<i>You have to at least try to
be here with me while I do it.</i>

13:56.122 --> 13:57.870
- <i>Have your parents said anything?</i>
- Dr. Ullah.

13:57.937 --> 13:59.573
Everything okay?

13:59.657 --> 14:01.617
<i>She's just a little girl!</i>

14:01.684 --> 14:03.621
Yeah, uh...

14:05.657 --> 14:06.975
I'm such an idiot.

14:07.042 --> 14:09.231
I forgot, I have
a meeting downtown.

14:09.298 --> 14:10.375
Okay.

14:10.443 --> 14:11.922
Drive safely.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.488
How much is that Porsche?

14:49.110 --> 14:51.973
That's the 911
Turbo S Cabriolet.

14:52.344 --> 14:56.308
580 horsepower,
zero to 60 in 2.8 seconds,

14:56.375 --> 14:59.824
and a 3.8-liter engine
with very little turbo lag.

15:01.508 --> 15:02.973
So, how much?

15:03.766 --> 15:05.415
205 K.

15:09.196 --> 15:11.145
You take American Express?

15:13.136 --> 15:15.740
Do you want to take it
for a test drive, sir?

15:16.157 --> 15:17.446
Nah.

15:18.995 --> 15:20.430
Whew.

15:20.825 --> 15:22.332
I just like it.

16:07.443 --> 16:08.575
Vik?

16:11.012 --> 16:12.228
What are you doing?

16:12.295 --> 16:14.243
Hey, Sierra.

16:14.893 --> 16:18.088
Actually, I don't know
if you've noticed this,

16:18.155 --> 16:22.180
but, uh, most Fridays,
I end up moving your trash cans

16:22.247 --> 16:24.782
back up into your driveway
because you somehow

16:24.849 --> 16:26.338
don't get around
to doing it before I...

16:26.405 --> 16:28.821
Oh, my God.
Is that your car?

16:30.250 --> 16:32.626
Yeah. I just got it.

16:34.497 --> 16:36.563
You know, if you
ever want to see

16:36.630 --> 16:40.095
what it can really do,
I know the best road in Malibu.

16:44.157 --> 16:45.657
How about now?

16:46.073 --> 16:49.053

16:55.616 --> 16:57.117

17:01.782 --> 17:05.988

17:06.319 --> 17:08.449
Apparently,
this road is haunted.

17:08.922 --> 17:10.117
No way.

17:10.365 --> 17:11.469
Yeah.

17:11.662 --> 17:13.548
The Indians considered it
forbidden ground.

17:13.615 --> 17:14.528
They wouldn't set foot here.

17:14.595 --> 17:16.522
And then, during the
Great Depression, there were

17:16.589 --> 17:18.036
these cultists
who lived here,

17:18.103 --> 17:20.728
and they were known for
wearing black robes and hoods,

17:20.795 --> 17:22.882
and they would tie
young boys to crosses

17:22.949 --> 17:24.194
and beat them to death.

17:24.262 --> 17:25.371
That's all?

17:25.438 --> 17:26.964
And then, years later,

17:27.031 --> 17:29.284
there was an insane asylum,
like, right here.

17:29.351 --> 17:30.867
- Come on.
- It's true.

17:30.934 --> 17:33.617

17:33.684 --> 17:37.230

17:37.321 --> 17:38.659
I have a question for you.

17:38.726 --> 17:39.883
Okay.

17:40.310 --> 17:42.349
I need the advice
of a grown man.

17:42.416 --> 17:43.477
Shoot.

17:43.545 --> 17:45.183
Okay, so...

17:45.783 --> 17:47.801
I've been hooking up
with this guy.

17:47.930 --> 17:49.048
It's casual.

17:49.115 --> 17:50.722
He's my age.

17:50.946 --> 17:52.558
He's good-looking enough.

17:52.760 --> 17:54.716
He's a model, actually.

17:55.595 --> 17:57.427
But he's so immature.

17:57.542 --> 18:00.510
And he sucks in bed.

18:00.577 --> 18:03.006
I mean, his dick doesn't even
get completely hard,

18:03.073 --> 18:04.436
and then he just
finishes so quickly,

18:04.503 --> 18:06.497
I don't even get
a chance to come.

18:07.157 --> 18:08.755
And I love to come.

18:11.398 --> 18:13.212
So you want me
to recommend a urologist?

18:13.279 --> 18:15.558
I just want to know
what's wrong with guys my age.

18:15.625 --> 18:19.083
I mean, how... how old were you
when you learned how to fuck?

18:19.712 --> 18:20.826
I mean, like...

18:20.893 --> 18:22.554
like, really fuck.

18:25.254 --> 18:26.733
I have an idea.

18:27.907 --> 18:30.349
Let's see how fast
this car can really go.

18:30.422 --> 18:32.599
I want to get home,
and I want to drink.

18:33.125 --> 18:34.802
You want to drink?

18:46.907 --> 18:48.887
What seems to be
the problem, Officer?

18:49.071 --> 18:50.535
House burning down?

18:50.667 --> 18:52.215
Friend here in labor?

18:54.115 --> 18:55.949
No, Officer.

18:56.211 --> 18:57.632
Okay, then you want to explain

18:57.699 --> 18:59.388
what the fuck
was going on back there?

18:59.455 --> 19:01.117
Yeah, we were just
having a good time.

19:01.184 --> 19:02.721
Got a little out of control.

19:02.922 --> 19:05.621
Okay, well, your good time
almost got you killed today.

19:07.157 --> 19:08.564
Oh, you think
that's funny.

19:08.631 --> 19:11.584
No. No, it's just, um...

19:13.456 --> 19:17.019
I have stage four cancer,
so I'll be dead soon anyway.

19:17.380 --> 19:19.629
That's not the first time
I've heard that, buddy.

19:20.157 --> 19:21.847
So write me a ticket, then.

19:22.305 --> 19:23.555
Okay.

19:32.091 --> 19:34.738
Uh, sorry about the mess.

19:36.741 --> 19:38.208
I live with kids.

19:38.275 --> 19:39.887
This is pristine.

19:45.561 --> 19:47.183
Is it your birthday?

19:47.657 --> 19:50.465
Uh, yeah,
a couple days ago.

19:51.083 --> 19:53.090
- Well, happy birthday.
- Yeah.

19:53.157 --> 19:56.999
Twenty-nine, no kids,
not married, no career.

19:57.066 --> 19:59.941
Just... really killing it.

20:00.151 --> 20:01.366
Looks like you had a party.

20:01.433 --> 20:02.561
Uh, no.

20:02.824 --> 20:04.826
This is all
from my mom.

20:04.893 --> 20:07.685
She's on a shoot
in Zanzibar.

20:08.494 --> 20:10.868
Further away she gets,
the more shit she sends.

20:10.935 --> 20:12.732
At least it's nice shit.

20:12.966 --> 20:15.826
Uh, that... that
is swag, actually.

20:16.143 --> 20:18.364
"From your friends at Sony.

20:18.479 --> 20:19.875
Happy wrap."

20:33.073 --> 20:35.387
So, how long have you
known you're sick?

20:39.910 --> 20:41.223
A few weeks.

20:41.683 --> 20:43.591
What kind of cancer?

20:44.157 --> 20:45.904
Pancreatic.

20:47.240 --> 20:48.943
That's a bad one, isn't it?

20:50.240 --> 20:52.029
You want to sit down?

20:56.115 --> 20:58.971
You, um...
you look good.

21:00.105 --> 21:02.083
Don't people
who have cancer

21:02.150 --> 21:04.164
usually lose their hair
from the chemo?

21:06.480 --> 21:08.137
I'm not getting chemo.

21:09.115 --> 21:10.152
Why not?

21:10.373 --> 21:12.046
It's not going to work.

21:12.871 --> 21:15.484
And it'll make the time
I have left a total nightmare.

21:16.449 --> 21:17.559
Drink.

21:26.324 --> 21:28.434
I'm gonna open
another bottle.

21:30.493 --> 21:32.285
Where are you from, Vik?

21:32.563 --> 21:33.980
I'm from here.

21:34.383 --> 21:36.161
My dad's from Lebanon,

21:36.228 --> 21:38.434
and my mom's from Mumbai.

21:40.172 --> 21:41.738
Do they know?

21:43.500 --> 21:44.881
I'm not sure.

21:44.948 --> 21:46.262
What do you mean?

21:46.524 --> 21:47.826
I told them,

21:47.893 --> 21:49.180
but...

21:51.086 --> 21:53.246
they won't hear that I'm sick.

21:54.670 --> 21:56.488
Like, literally.

21:57.211 --> 21:59.488
They seem unable to process it.

22:00.118 --> 22:01.617
And today, I heard myself

22:01.684 --> 22:04.543
promising them that Helen
was going to have my baby.

22:05.899 --> 22:07.141
Really?

22:07.568 --> 22:08.817
For them.

22:09.407 --> 22:10.637
Not for me.

22:11.416 --> 22:13.113
Not for her.

22:14.266 --> 22:15.758
For them.

22:16.946 --> 22:19.855
So I don't fail them completely.

22:28.398 --> 22:29.816
You know, I think...

22:33.118 --> 22:37.137
I think, when you have
immigrant parents,

22:37.449 --> 22:39.910
you end up being
responsible for them.

22:40.907 --> 22:42.668
Like, you're the parent.

22:44.281 --> 22:46.113
Yeah, I know that feeling.

22:47.368 --> 22:50.051
I was the perfect immigrant son.

22:51.118 --> 22:53.301
But I made a deal with myself...

22:53.535 --> 22:55.051
long time ago.

22:56.930 --> 23:00.147
I said, okay,
I will become a doctor

23:00.214 --> 23:02.707
because that's what they want.

23:03.282 --> 23:05.551
And I will support them,

23:05.854 --> 23:08.191
and I will make them proud.

23:09.086 --> 23:10.501
I'll even move back to L.A.

23:10.568 --> 23:12.482
so I can take care of them
when they're old,

23:12.549 --> 23:15.691
but I will not marry for them.

23:17.240 --> 23:19.676
And I will not
have children for them.

23:20.258 --> 23:23.230
I will do all that stuff
on my time.

23:24.857 --> 23:26.488
Not theirs.

23:27.616 --> 23:29.512
And then I met this woman.

23:31.383 --> 23:33.929
And she already had kids, and...

23:35.428 --> 23:38.066
I think there was
a part of me that...

23:38.807 --> 23:41.012
liked that, you know?

23:42.055 --> 23:46.098
Because I knew it was gonna
drive them fucking crazy.

23:50.234 --> 23:51.855
Everything...

23:55.483 --> 23:57.895
Everything I've done

23:59.149 --> 24:01.441
has either been for

24:02.191 --> 24:04.671
or in reaction to them.

24:08.235 --> 24:10.598
I'm 45 years old.

24:12.734 --> 24:15.715
I'm at the top of my profession.

24:17.865 --> 24:19.668
I'm going to die.

24:23.106 --> 24:27.895
And I haven't really made
a single choice for myself.

25:06.149 --> 25:09.324
Guess what my mother's
favorite thing about me is.

25:11.657 --> 25:12.930
What?

25:13.391 --> 25:14.782
My skin.

25:17.866 --> 25:18.866
Your skin?

25:18.969 --> 25:20.668
Yeah, my skin.

25:21.149 --> 25:23.027
She's obsessed with it.

25:23.423 --> 25:25.317
Whenever I see her,
she's always

25:25.839 --> 25:27.668
touching it
or pinching it.

25:32.519 --> 25:35.918
She will never forgive me
for being younger than she is.

29:17.664 --> 29:18.852
Hey.

29:19.417 --> 29:20.542
Help you?

29:20.610 --> 29:21.757
Yeah, maybe.

29:21.824 --> 29:23.941
I mean, it's probably
a lost cause,

29:24.008 --> 29:25.826
but I'm trying to figure out
who made this board,

29:25.893 --> 29:27.772
and I think it came
from around here in Morro Bay.

29:27.839 --> 29:28.914
Oh.

29:29.656 --> 29:31.553
- You mind?
- Nope. Go ahead.

29:32.657 --> 29:33.782
Wow.

29:34.367 --> 29:35.595
It's beautiful.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.637
Thank you.
It's my father's.

29:38.242 --> 29:39.574
Hey, Joe.

29:39.805 --> 29:41.512
You come take a look at this?

29:44.425 --> 29:46.361
- Hey. I'm Cole.
- Joey.

29:46.428 --> 29:48.241
Nice to meet
you, Joey.

29:48.308 --> 29:49.887
Let me see this.

29:51.782 --> 29:54.793
Well, this is
original, huh?

29:55.755 --> 29:58.816
We see a, uh, lot
of wooden kit boards,

29:58.883 --> 30:00.325
but not many
like this.

30:00.392 --> 30:02.236
You, uh...
you selling?

30:02.303 --> 30:04.558
No, no. Just trying
to figure out who made it.

30:04.625 --> 30:05.853
From around here?

30:05.920 --> 30:07.590
Well, could be anybody.

30:07.657 --> 30:09.130
Definitely 1970s, though.

30:09.197 --> 30:11.984
You got the classic nose
and the swallow tail,

30:12.051 --> 30:13.761
a single fin, uh...

30:13.828 --> 30:15.105
heavy varnish.

30:15.199 --> 30:16.721
Not too many
surf shops back then.

30:16.881 --> 30:18.303
Just a bunch
of individual shapers

30:18.370 --> 30:20.365
working out
of garages, but...

30:20.571 --> 30:22.718
whoever made it
had a good touch.

30:24.775 --> 30:26.200
I recognize this.

30:26.369 --> 30:28.314
It's not from a surf shop,
though. It's a, um...

30:28.381 --> 30:31.013
this art gallery
a couple blocks over.

30:31.449 --> 30:33.261
- Well, good luck.
- Thank you.

30:33.328 --> 30:34.561
Let me know
what you come up with.

30:34.628 --> 30:35.685
Will do.

31:24.324 --> 31:26.264
Hello.
Can I help you?

31:29.800 --> 31:30.941
Gabriel.

31:31.009 --> 31:32.301
Excuse me?

31:35.545 --> 31:37.992
I'm... I'm so sorry.

31:38.059 --> 31:39.600
You just...

31:39.791 --> 31:42.856
You just look so much
like someone I used to know.

31:42.923 --> 31:44.585
Gabriel Lockhart.

31:44.847 --> 31:45.847
Yes.

31:46.792 --> 31:48.082
I'm sorry. I...

31:48.149 --> 31:49.632
I'm his son.

31:50.489 --> 31:52.095
My name is Cole.

31:54.240 --> 31:55.659
Well...

31:56.157 --> 31:58.151
this is unexpected.

31:58.218 --> 32:00.718
Nice to meet you, Cole.

32:00.878 --> 32:02.319
Uh, I'm Nan.

32:03.214 --> 32:05.780
- Is this your gallery?
- It is.

32:05.907 --> 32:07.463
Maybe you can help me
with something.

32:07.530 --> 32:08.820
This is my father's board,

32:08.887 --> 32:11.382
and it has the same
symbol on it.

32:11.753 --> 32:13.470
Oh, my God.

32:15.741 --> 32:17.120
May I?

32:17.597 --> 32:18.886
Sure.

32:21.074 --> 32:22.803
Look at this.

32:24.449 --> 32:25.947
Does it still float?

32:26.014 --> 32:27.034
Perfectly.

32:28.313 --> 32:30.238
I had no idea
what I was doing.

32:30.305 --> 32:32.340
I was so young.

32:32.407 --> 32:34.095
You made this board?

32:35.434 --> 32:36.895
I did.

32:37.597 --> 32:38.984
You're a shaper?

32:39.051 --> 32:40.422
Not exactly.

32:40.489 --> 32:43.367
This was the only
surfboard I ever carved.

32:46.198 --> 32:47.324
So...

32:47.394 --> 32:50.078
what brings you
to Morro Bay, Cole?

32:50.394 --> 32:51.998
I'm not sure exactly.

32:52.254 --> 32:53.324
From...?

32:53.407 --> 32:55.637
- Montauk.
- Montauk.

32:56.873 --> 32:58.123
Amazing.

33:00.465 --> 33:01.324
Hi there.

33:01.407 --> 33:02.961
Uh, I'll just be a sec.

33:05.235 --> 33:09.122
Um, how long are you in town?

33:11.286 --> 33:12.975
I don't know, really.

33:13.094 --> 33:15.106
I mean, I just got here, so...

33:15.303 --> 33:17.366
Why don't you come by tonight?

33:17.657 --> 33:20.470
I host a weekly salon.

33:20.798 --> 33:21.867
If you're anything

33:21.934 --> 33:23.115
like your father,

33:23.182 --> 33:25.051
I think
you'd like it.

33:27.821 --> 33:29.362
Sure.

33:44.927 --> 33:47.176
I'm so glad you found me, Cole.

33:50.910 --> 33:52.259
Thank you.

33:56.711 --> 33:58.149
I'm sorry.

33:58.727 --> 34:01.957
This piece over here is
the one you had your eye on?

34:09.525 --> 34:14.223
If these pellets are
just compressed protein,

34:14.290 --> 34:17.371
why deplete
the ocean for them?

34:17.907 --> 34:21.512
Now, as an entrepreneur, John...

34:21.657 --> 34:23.033
This is over my head.

34:23.100 --> 34:24.721
No, it is not.

34:24.917 --> 34:26.105
Sit up and listen.

34:27.947 --> 34:30.259
Oh, look. There he is.

34:30.326 --> 34:34.081
Everyone, here stands
a gift from the past.

34:34.251 --> 34:36.902
The son of a man
I used to know.

34:37.016 --> 34:38.554
You know, they say

34:38.625 --> 34:40.523
time moves in a straight line,

34:40.590 --> 34:42.887
but really,
it moves in circles.

34:43.007 --> 34:45.090
I'm so glad you made it.

34:47.114 --> 34:48.443
Thanks
for the invite.

34:48.510 --> 34:50.195
Yep. Oh, thank you.

34:50.262 --> 34:51.485
Very nice.

34:51.632 --> 34:53.534
Nice place
you got here.

34:53.601 --> 34:55.469
It absorbs people.

34:55.570 --> 34:57.426
That's what I love about it.

35:07.204 --> 35:09.762
That's my protégée, Delphine.

35:09.922 --> 35:11.660
Isn't she beautiful?

35:14.145 --> 35:15.863
I'm married.

35:16.748 --> 35:18.328
So, being married prevents you

35:18.395 --> 35:21.718
from forming an opinion
about a beautiful woman?

35:22.524 --> 35:24.655
No, not at all.

35:26.476 --> 35:27.810
Here.

35:27.878 --> 35:29.002
Whoa. Hey, what are you doing?

35:29.069 --> 35:30.543
It's okay.

35:30.886 --> 35:32.971
Poor guy.
You're all bound up.

35:35.310 --> 35:36.891
Take a breath.

35:36.958 --> 35:38.512
A deep one.

35:39.838 --> 35:42.444
Go ahead. It's not
gonna kill you.

35:46.919 --> 35:49.290
And let it out slowly.

35:56.033 --> 35:57.317
Better?

36:02.614 --> 36:05.079
What was your relationship
to my father?

36:06.576 --> 36:08.211
We were lovers.

36:11.278 --> 36:13.086
For how long?

36:13.657 --> 36:15.610
Oh, a few months.

36:15.741 --> 36:17.215
It was the late '70s.

36:17.282 --> 36:18.908
Everyone loved someone.

36:18.975 --> 36:21.220
That summer,
I loved your father.

36:22.699 --> 36:24.449
And then?

36:24.517 --> 36:25.809
Nothing.

36:25.907 --> 36:27.840
He went home.

36:27.907 --> 36:30.700
I met someone else.
Life moved on.

36:30.767 --> 36:32.344
What about
the surfboard?

36:33.317 --> 36:35.516
You know what
Freud said.

36:35.811 --> 36:39.032
Sometimes a cigar
is just a cigar.

36:39.800 --> 36:41.044
Delphine.

36:41.574 --> 36:43.079
This is Cole.

36:43.185 --> 36:45.454
Cole, this is
Delphine.

36:45.872 --> 36:47.122
Hi, Cole.

36:47.190 --> 36:48.567
Hi.

36:50.120 --> 36:51.685
Want some?

36:54.254 --> 36:55.552
Sure.

37:00.935 --> 37:02.677
Oh, shit.

37:17.613 --> 37:19.196
So...

37:19.490 --> 37:21.240
So?

37:22.563 --> 37:24.752
You want to
tell me about it?

37:26.071 --> 37:27.665
Tell you about what?

37:27.732 --> 37:30.218
No one drives all the way
across the country

37:30.285 --> 37:32.572
just to see about a surfboard.
Okay.

37:35.749 --> 37:37.914
What's going on
in your marriage?

37:38.832 --> 37:41.602
Luisa and I are working
through some things.

37:41.669 --> 37:43.399
Your father was also

37:43.466 --> 37:45.035
going through a hard time
in his marriage

37:45.102 --> 37:46.710
when he got here.

37:47.285 --> 37:48.936
How long was he here for?

37:49.032 --> 37:50.410
Not long.

37:51.456 --> 37:53.390
Four or five months.

37:53.785 --> 37:55.960
And the two of you
were together?

37:56.143 --> 37:58.007
For a while, yes.

38:02.058 --> 38:05.971
I never really thought
he got out of Montauk much.

38:06.038 --> 38:08.739
Oh, no, he traveled quite a bit.

38:08.806 --> 38:09.862
I think.

38:10.089 --> 38:11.921
Or he wanted to.

38:12.648 --> 38:15.468
I can't remember.
I just remember a...

38:15.791 --> 38:19.647
great, big, adventurous soul.

38:21.074 --> 38:23.663
I wouldn't describe him
as adventurous.

38:23.894 --> 38:25.240
Okay.

38:25.464 --> 38:27.280
How would you describe him?

38:28.772 --> 38:30.121
Drunk.

38:31.506 --> 38:33.081
Abusive.

38:34.333 --> 38:36.054
Emotionally absent.

38:36.963 --> 38:39.311
Chronically depressed.

38:39.699 --> 38:41.183
Wow.

38:41.964 --> 38:44.983
Doesn't sound like
the Gabriel I knew at all.

38:51.160 --> 38:52.757
How is your mother?

38:52.907 --> 38:55.288
Cherry is fine.

38:55.529 --> 38:57.561
Cherry's good, actually.

38:59.675 --> 39:01.397
Are they still together?

39:02.253 --> 39:04.304
No, he's dead, Nan.

39:07.277 --> 39:08.449
What?

39:08.867 --> 39:10.367
He's dead.

39:12.198 --> 39:14.960
I'm sorry. I figured
you would've known that.

39:16.097 --> 39:17.407
When?

39:17.893 --> 39:19.331
Years ago.

39:19.464 --> 39:21.194
I was a little boy.

39:23.471 --> 39:25.077
Oh, my God.

39:26.714 --> 39:28.858
Wow, Gabriel.

39:39.688 --> 39:41.206
I...

39:41.861 --> 39:44.425
I need some air, love. Um...

39:44.741 --> 39:46.811
when you're ready to go to bed,

39:46.878 --> 39:49.303
Delphine will show you
to your room.

39:56.503 --> 39:58.194
You an artist, too?

39:59.029 --> 40:00.753
I paint.

40:01.932 --> 40:03.373
Where you from?

40:04.401 --> 40:05.690
Idaho.

40:06.105 --> 40:07.917
Idaho?

40:08.472 --> 40:10.581
Oh, man.

40:12.424 --> 40:14.256
How long you been out here?

40:14.564 --> 40:17.183
I met Nan
at a trade show

40:17.250 --> 40:19.507
maybe...
five years ago?

40:19.574 --> 40:22.100
And followed her
to California to study.

40:22.324 --> 40:26.248
She lets me stay for free
as long as I help out a bit.

40:30.323 --> 40:32.733
It gets bright in here
in the mornings.

40:33.589 --> 40:35.686
Let the shower run for a minute.

40:35.753 --> 40:37.887
It takes a little while
for it to get hot.

40:39.216 --> 40:41.733
Okay. Thank you.

41:02.691 --> 41:04.381
What are you doing?

41:08.748 --> 41:10.895
I come with the room.

41:17.339 --> 41:19.110
What kind of game
are you playing here?

41:19.177 --> 41:20.721
I'm married.

41:20.854 --> 41:22.174
Okay.

41:22.407 --> 41:24.186
Look, I don't know who you are,

41:24.253 --> 41:25.273
and I don't know
what this place is,

41:25.340 --> 41:27.734
but I came here to find out why
my father came to California,

41:27.801 --> 41:30.244
- not to cheat on my wife.
- Okay, then don't.

41:30.311 --> 41:32.627
Well, I'm trying not to,
but it's a little difficult

41:32.694 --> 41:34.742
when you got a half-naked
woman in your bed.

41:34.809 --> 41:36.549
Ask her to leave.

41:37.990 --> 41:40.701
I'm sure she was
just trying to help.

41:40.768 --> 41:43.992
You seem wound so tight, Cole.

41:44.059 --> 41:45.284
To help?

41:46.206 --> 41:48.319
I don't need that kind of help.

41:48.741 --> 41:51.554
I can't believe I have
to even explain this to you.

41:51.924 --> 41:53.529
Maybe I shouldn't
be surprised, though.

41:53.596 --> 41:55.156
I mean, you slept with
my father when he was married,

41:55.223 --> 41:57.312
so clearly marriage isn't
that much of a problem to you.

41:57.379 --> 42:00.717
Actually, your father's marriage
was my biggest problem.

42:02.198 --> 42:03.897
What is that supposed to mean?

42:09.791 --> 42:11.611
What is this? A love letter?

42:11.678 --> 42:12.690
Yes.

42:12.758 --> 42:14.459
I have a whole box
of them.

42:21.573 --> 42:23.389
When did he write all those?

42:23.964 --> 42:25.640
We wrote to each other
on and off

42:25.707 --> 42:27.492
after he left Morro Bay.

42:27.559 --> 42:28.897
For how long?

42:29.115 --> 42:30.982
About ten years.

42:31.049 --> 42:33.595
I thought you said
it was a brief affair.

42:35.029 --> 42:36.529
I lied.

42:42.770 --> 42:44.936
I can't believe he's dead.

42:47.582 --> 42:51.334
There was a time I thought
he was my be'shert.

42:52.541 --> 42:54.444
Do you know
what that word means?

42:55.315 --> 42:57.639
It means soul mate.

42:57.706 --> 42:59.209
My destiny.

42:59.549 --> 43:00.940
Look.

43:04.972 --> 43:06.180
You see?

43:09.563 --> 43:11.096
"N"...

43:12.693 --> 43:14.025
"G."

43:19.339 --> 43:22.029
That surfboard
was his favorite thing.

43:23.003 --> 43:25.147
We met down at the beach.

43:26.657 --> 43:30.053
I'd seen him
around town before, but...

43:30.256 --> 43:32.811
he was such a loner.

43:32.878 --> 43:34.680
He always kept to himself.

43:37.397 --> 43:41.100
I asked him if I could
take pictures of him.

43:42.287 --> 43:43.792
He was...

43:44.393 --> 43:46.670
so handsome, so...

43:46.745 --> 43:48.370
striking.

43:48.924 --> 43:51.795
After that first night,
we were never apart

43:52.015 --> 43:53.662
for four months.

43:55.907 --> 43:58.623
He called me "Wild Eyes."

44:03.284 --> 44:06.846
He said he didn't know women
like me existed in the world.

44:09.336 --> 44:10.982
I'll show you.

44:12.990 --> 44:14.681
"You asked me what I want

44:14.748 --> 44:16.137
from you, my love.

44:16.221 --> 44:18.178
My answer is simple.

44:18.471 --> 44:19.890
First, your mind.

44:19.957 --> 44:21.686
Then your body.

44:22.115 --> 44:23.819
Then your soul."

44:32.160 --> 44:34.014
So, why'd he leave?

44:36.619 --> 44:38.670
Cherry was pregnant.

44:39.506 --> 44:41.997
She wrote that if
he didn't come home,

44:42.064 --> 44:44.601
she would kill herself.

44:46.532 --> 44:47.760
What?

44:48.440 --> 44:50.061
So he left.

44:59.057 --> 45:01.334
And then what?
He just stopped writing?

45:01.901 --> 45:04.406
No, but his letters

45:04.473 --> 45:07.787
became more sad, bitter.

45:08.104 --> 45:10.773
They kept having more kids,
he felt trapped,

45:10.840 --> 45:14.506
and the thought of me
was just making him miserable.

45:14.702 --> 45:18.186
So I devised a plan,

45:18.626 --> 45:22.756
a way to extract me
from his heart and his head.

45:23.479 --> 45:25.740
To forget me once and for all.

45:26.214 --> 45:29.154
An exorcism of sorts.

45:31.157 --> 45:32.623
Did it work?

45:33.268 --> 45:34.586
It did.

45:34.654 --> 45:36.342
How do you know that?

45:36.532 --> 45:38.472
Because the last task,

45:38.539 --> 45:41.935
the final instruction,
if he finally knew

45:42.002 --> 45:44.725
he was no longer
in love with me,

45:45.196 --> 45:47.990
was to send my letters back.

45:48.893 --> 45:50.554
All of them.

45:54.883 --> 45:56.488
And here they are.

46:00.365 --> 46:02.233
I'm sorry, Nan.

46:03.182 --> 46:05.053
Don't be, sweetheart.

46:05.211 --> 46:07.381
We wanted different things.

46:07.574 --> 46:09.975
I have no regrets.

46:13.240 --> 46:14.920
Don't worry.

46:16.448 --> 46:18.248
Neither did he.

46:29.670 --> 46:32.283
<i>You've reached the
voice mail of Alison and...</i>

46:32.350 --> 46:33.382
<i>Joanie!</i>

46:33.449 --> 46:35.748
We can't get
to the phone right now so...

46:38.471 --> 46:40.026
Fuck.

47:23.988 --> 47:26.108
How did the exorcism work?

47:27.344 --> 47:30.311
I sent your father
five final letters,

47:30.690 --> 47:32.343
one at a time.

47:32.472 --> 47:35.225
Each one with a task.

47:35.699 --> 47:37.750
Every time he completed a task,

47:37.817 --> 47:39.521
I sent him another.

47:43.550 --> 47:45.152
Read this.

47:54.657 --> 47:57.095
"Find my scent in nature."

Nan, my dad didn't send
these letters to you.

53:54.360 --> 53:56.082
What do you mean?

53:57.560 --> 54:00.402
It's postmarked
two years after he died.

54:06.579 --> 54:08.434
I don't understand.

54:12.670 --> 54:15.107
I think my mom
found those letters.

54:16.352 --> 54:18.582
And then read them,
and then sent them to you,

54:19.102 --> 54:22.074
hoping you'd think
they'd come from him.

54:32.545 --> 54:34.524
All this time, I...

54:35.923 --> 54:38.488

love me anymore.

54:48.365 --> 54:50.191

54:58.585 --> 55:01.230
He hung himself
on my tenth birthday.
