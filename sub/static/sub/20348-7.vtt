01:38.099 --> 01:39.726
What do you want?

01:43.772 --> 01:45.523
I wanna be cremated.

01:47.567 --> 01:49.194
You got it. No problem.

01:49.527 --> 01:50.820
<i>- You sure?</i>
- Mmm-hmm.

01:51.196 --> 01:52.989
Because Matt's gonna wanna
bury me next to Mom and Dad

01:53.156 --> 01:55.325
in the old Jamison plot
about a mile from here.

01:55.492 --> 01:56.701
He's gonna put up a fight.

01:56.951 --> 01:58.536
Fuck Matt.

01:58.703 --> 02:00.747
If you wanna be cremated,
I'll make sure you're cremated.

02:02.373 --> 02:03.541
We'll burn you up good.

02:08.129 --> 02:09.672
What about you?

02:13.968 --> 02:15.553
I wanna be stuffed.

02:15.762 --> 02:17.388
- Excuse me?
- Stuffed.

02:17.555 --> 02:19.557
Like, you know, taxidermy.

02:21.351 --> 02:22.477
You don't have to display me prominently.

02:22.644 --> 02:25.897
Just stick me in the corner
of the bedroom or something.

02:29.234 --> 02:30.944
- I'll get it.
- No, she'll settle.

02:40.286 --> 02:42.330
Okay, I'll stuff you.

02:42.497 --> 02:44.123
On one condition.

02:45.959 --> 02:47.126
Shoot.

02:48.127 --> 02:50.171
I get to put a beard on you.

02:51.005 --> 02:52.257
Why?

02:54.175 --> 02:56.928
Because I'm the one that has to
have sex with that abomination.

02:57.095 --> 02:59.472
I'm gonna dress it up how I want.

03:04.602 --> 03:06.229
You want me to grow a beard.

03:07.730 --> 03:08.731
Do I?

04:08.750 --> 04:10.460
Shit! This is it. Wake up.

04:10.668 --> 04:12.962
Wake the fuck up. Wake up.

04:13.129 --> 04:15.298
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!

04:15.548 --> 04:17.342
God damn it! Shit, this is it.

04:17.550 --> 04:19.761
It's today! It's today. Wake up!

04:19.928 --> 04:21.763
- What's going on?
- What happened?

04:21.930 --> 04:24.933
What happened is your wife fucking
drugged us, talked him out of it.

04:25.099 --> 04:28.853
Now the goddamn flood's coming,
and we're all gonna fucking die.

04:30.605 --> 04:32.690
- His horse is here. His horse is here.
<i>- Huh?</i>

04:32.857 --> 04:33.983
What the fuck...

04:36.152 --> 04:37.946
Oh, Jesus Christ!

04:53.002 --> 04:54.003
Help me!

04:54.504 --> 04:56.673
<i>Come on! Get him off that!</i>

04:58.841 --> 05:00.426
Get him out!

05:00.593 --> 05:02.136
<i>Get him the fuck out!</i>

05:02.387 --> 05:03.805
<i>Get him off, God damn it!</i>

05:04.013 --> 05:05.598
<i>Get him off!</i>

05:06.057 --> 05:08.393
Stop!

05:08.685 --> 05:10.603
Stop!

05:11.187 --> 05:12.313
What are you doing?

05:12.522 --> 05:13.523
What are you doing?

05:13.898 --> 05:15.858
I'm doing what you asked me to do.

05:17.193 --> 05:19.112
I thought we'd do it together.

05:23.741 --> 05:26.536
I know what you want me to say to Evie.
Anything else?

05:29.414 --> 05:30.581
No.

05:30.748 --> 05:32.458
My children.

05:32.625 --> 05:35.169
You saw the photos.
Do you remember their names?

05:35.795 --> 05:38.965
Liam, Abigail, David, Samantha, Jimmy.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.135
Thank you.

05:43.428 --> 05:46.514
You want me to find Christopher Sunday,
learn the song,

05:46.681 --> 05:48.057
so you can stop the flood, right?

05:51.436 --> 05:52.603
Right.

05:56.232 --> 05:57.608
Then let go.

07:12.975 --> 07:15.812
Kevin Harvey.

07:32.370 --> 07:34.497
No. No! Please, please, please, please.

07:34.956 --> 07:36.124
Don't.

07:37.208 --> 07:40.878
Kilo Hotel is secure.
I repeat, Kilo Hotel is secure.

07:44.090 --> 07:45.466
<i>Mr. Harvey.</i>

07:48.219 --> 07:49.554
Is that your place up there?

07:55.518 --> 07:56.519
Yeah.

07:58.229 --> 08:00.189
Well, are you gonna invite me in?

08:13.578 --> 08:15.746
You got any other reflective surfaces?

08:15.913 --> 08:18.166
TV screens, glassware,
stainless steel pots?

08:18.541 --> 08:19.667
Uh...

08:20.084 --> 08:21.085
No.

08:21.919 --> 08:23.171
The fuck are these?

08:25.423 --> 08:27.383
Uh... My sunglasses.

08:31.971 --> 08:35.057
No reflective surfaces.

08:36.225 --> 08:37.977
Do not look into them no matter what.

08:38.144 --> 08:40.062
That's how they found you.

08:40.313 --> 08:42.023
Yeah. Right.

08:51.616 --> 08:55.536
"He stood on the bow of <i>The Merciful...</i>

08:58.372 --> 09:01.876
"The water endlessly stretching
to the infinite horizon

09:02.043 --> 09:05.379
"as he contemplated the impossible
distance between them,

09:05.546 --> 09:08.716
"but he would not stop
until he found her."

09:08.883 --> 09:10.259
What, are you writing a book?

09:11.469 --> 09:13.012
There's no shame in it.

09:13.179 --> 09:16.307
What you do in your retirement
is your business.

09:17.141 --> 09:19.602
Unfortunately,

09:19.769 --> 09:22.647
folks in your line of work
don't get to retire.

09:25.983 --> 09:27.818
I'm an assassin.

09:27.985 --> 09:30.488
Yes, sir, Mr. Harvey.

09:30.655 --> 09:32.823
So, let's get assassinating, shall we?

09:35.076 --> 09:36.702
Who's the target?

09:37.662 --> 09:38.996
President.

09:40.539 --> 09:43.042
- The President?
<i>- Of the United States.</i>

09:43.960 --> 09:45.753
And based on our Intel, in,

09:45.920 --> 09:47.380
well, just under two hours

09:47.546 --> 09:50.466
he's gonna start
an unsanctioned nuclear war.

09:52.343 --> 09:56.013
And you are the only man alive who
can get to him before he does.

09:58.766 --> 10:02.395
Mr. Harvey, you gonna have
trouble putting him down?

10:02.561 --> 10:03.604
No.

10:06.399 --> 10:08.734
But I'm gonna need something in exchange.

10:09.318 --> 10:10.903
Okay. What?

10:11.696 --> 10:14.490
I need to find some people.

10:14.657 --> 10:15.992
Five kids.

10:16.158 --> 10:18.995
Liam, Abigail, Samantha,

10:19.203 --> 10:20.788
David, and Jimmy Playford.

10:21.998 --> 10:25.293
I also need to talk to a woman named
Evangeline Murphy and a man,

10:25.459 --> 10:26.836
Christopher Sunday.

10:27.003 --> 10:28.713
Christopher Sunday?

10:30.381 --> 10:32.717
The Prime Minister of Australia?

10:35.511 --> 10:36.595
Yeah.

10:36.971 --> 10:39.015
Man, you want that kind
of high-level access,

10:39.181 --> 10:42.226
you're gonna have to talk
to the boss yourself.

10:45.271 --> 10:46.272
Here.

10:46.439 --> 10:48.524
Stick that in your ear.

10:48.691 --> 10:51.235
You'll hear him, he'll hear you.

10:51.402 --> 10:54.363
He'll talk you through this
whole shit show.

10:57.366 --> 10:59.702
<i>Now, the evac chopper is two minutes out.</i>

11:03.331 --> 11:05.916
You're gonna wanna
get yourself dressed.

11:22.099 --> 11:24.101
<i>Testing, one, two, three.</i>

11:25.144 --> 11:27.146
<i>Testing, one, two, three.</i>

11:27.897 --> 11:29.690
<i>Are you receiving me?</i>

11:30.608 --> 11:31.609
Who is this?

11:32.777 --> 11:34.320
<i>Mission control.</i>

11:36.280 --> 11:37.448
Do I know you?

11:37.615 --> 11:39.909
<i>I'm sitting in the railway station</i>

11:40.159 --> 11:42.620
<i>Got a ticket to my destination</i>

11:46.957 --> 11:48.584
You made me sing.

11:50.127 --> 11:51.545
I met you on the bridge.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.089
<i>And do you remember, Mr. Harvey,</i>

11:53.631 --> 11:55.966
<i>what I said to you
that night on the bridge,</i>

11:56.258 --> 11:57.968
<i>what I whispered in your ear?</i>

12:01.931 --> 12:05.142
You said I was the most
powerful man in the world.

12:06.394 --> 12:08.312
<i>Goddamn right, you are.</i>

12:08.813 --> 12:12.525
<i>Now, go pick up that piece of mirror
and look at yourself.</i>

12:13.484 --> 12:14.985
I thought I wasn't supposed
to look in reflective...

12:15.152 --> 12:16.237
<i>Shut up.</i>

12:16.404 --> 12:17.655
<i>You wanna get what you came here for?</i>

12:17.822 --> 12:20.783
<i>Pick up that mirror and look at yourself.</i>

13:25.806 --> 13:27.391
<i>G'day... G'day, Melbourne.</i>

13:32.771 --> 13:34.231
<i>Um</i>...

13:34.732 --> 13:37.401
<i>Thank you for the warm welcome.</i>

13:38.194 --> 13:41.614
<i>This isn't my first time visiting
the other side of the world.</i>

13:42.406 --> 13:45.743
<i>Every time I'm here it gets harder
and harder to leave.</i>

13:49.872 --> 13:50.873
<i>Uh...</i>

13:51.916 --> 13:55.294
<i>I've come, uh, to talk you
today about marriage.</i>

13:56.253 --> 13:59.173
<i>For millennia, we have believed marriage</i>

13:59.340 --> 14:02.259
<i>is a cornerstone of our civilization.</i>

14:02.426 --> 14:05.554
<i>Our party, however,
does not share this opinion.</i>

14:07.473 --> 14:10.601
<i>We believe that marriage
is the single most destructive idea</i>

14:10.768 --> 14:13.229
<i>ever conceived of by humankind.</i>

14:13.395 --> 14:17.691
<i>That's why in my first hundred days
in office, I introduced legislation...</i>

14:23.948 --> 14:25.115
<i>I'm the President.</i>

14:30.621 --> 14:31.622
<i>Um...</i>

14:32.206 --> 14:35.543
<i>And as... As President, my friends,
tradition is powerful.</i>

14:36.627 --> 14:38.003
<i>In the early days of our movement,</i>

14:38.170 --> 14:40.714
<i>it was mandatory
that all members smoke cigarettes</i>

14:40.881 --> 14:42.675
<i>and refrain from speaking,</i>

14:42.841 --> 14:45.594
<i>but we realized those
traditions were stupid.</i>

14:46.345 --> 14:47.471
<i>Now,</i>

14:47.638 --> 14:49.306
<i>it's an understandable concern.</i>

14:50.683 --> 14:53.978
<i>If there is no marriage,
what happens to the family?</i>

14:55.271 --> 14:56.897
<i>What happens to the children?</i>

14:58.816 --> 15:03.153
<i>And so we decided to
have a worldwide essay contest.</i>

15:03.612 --> 15:05.990
<i>To answer that question
in their own words.</i>

15:07.074 --> 15:10.661
<i>We have one of the finalists, uh,
from that contest here</i>

15:10.828 --> 15:12.663
<i>with us today.</i>

15:12.830 --> 15:16.458
<i>He is joined by his brothers
and sisters for his essay titled,</i>

15:16.625 --> 15:19.503
<i>"Why I Don't Need a Mommy
and a Daddy Anymore."</i>

15:19.670 --> 15:21.672
<i>Please welcome Australia's own...</i>

15:25.384 --> 15:27.886
<i>um, Liam Playford.</i>

15:40.232 --> 15:41.358
<i>Liam...</i>

15:43.819 --> 15:46.196
<i>Why aren't you wearing any shoes?</i>

15:48.616 --> 15:52.369
<i>Your shoes. You're not
wearing any shoes. Where are they?</i>

15:53.037 --> 15:54.747
Why does it matter?

15:56.790 --> 15:59.835
<i>Well, somebody wants...</i>

16:00.002 --> 16:02.588
<i>Somebody in your family wants to know.</i>

16:03.881 --> 16:07.134
But you said there is no family.

16:11.388 --> 16:12.514
<i>Love</i>

16:14.433 --> 16:16.894
<i>Love will keep us together</i>

16:18.771 --> 16:22.024
<i>Think of me, babe, whenever</i>

16:22.691 --> 16:26.070
<i>Some sweet-talking girl comes along...</i>

16:26.570 --> 16:28.197
<i>Singing her song</i>

16:28.447 --> 16:29.740
<i>Don't mess around...</i>

16:29.907 --> 16:31.450
Sir, we have a situation.

16:31.617 --> 16:33.577
We need to move you now.

16:33.786 --> 16:35.996
No, wait. I, uh...

16:36.163 --> 16:37.748
I have to talk to that girl.

16:37.915 --> 16:39.124
No, we haven't got time for that, sir.

16:39.333 --> 16:40.751
We need to get you to a secure location.

16:40.918 --> 16:43.545
I'm not going fucking anywhere
until I talk to that girl.

16:44.755 --> 16:46.298
Okay, I'll get her.

16:46.465 --> 16:48.217
Get him to the car.

16:48.759 --> 16:50.719
This way, please, sir.

16:55.099 --> 16:58.185
Mr. President, Chief of Staff
on the phone.

16:59.561 --> 17:00.688
Hello?

17:00.854 --> 17:03.023
<i>Mr. President, it appears
Ukrainian separatists</i>

17:03.190 --> 17:05.484
<i>have taken control
of an armed nuclear submarine,</i>

17:05.651 --> 17:08.404
<i>and they'll have launch
capability within two hours.</i>

17:08.570 --> 17:09.613
<i>You're being brought to a bunker,</i>

17:09.780 --> 17:13.283
<i>which you will access with your
unique biometrics once inside.</i>

17:13.450 --> 17:15.786
- Sorry, my unique biometrics?
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

17:15.953 --> 17:18.205
<i>The door can only be
unlocked by you and you alone</i>

17:18.414 --> 17:21.583
<i>unless you have an identical twin brother,
which would be ridiculous.</i>

17:21.750 --> 17:23.627
Yeah, that would be ridiculous.

17:23.877 --> 17:27.047
<i>Sir, do I have your permission
to move us to DEFCON 2?</i>

17:27.464 --> 17:29.633
Um, what DEFCON are we at right now?

17:29.842 --> 17:30.843
<i>We're at DEFCON 3, sir.</i>

17:31.218 --> 17:33.303
Uh, DEFCON 2 is worse?

17:33.470 --> 17:35.305
<i>Yes, sir, it's worse.</i>

17:35.514 --> 17:40.894
Let's just stay where we're at right now
until we have more, um, uh, Intel.

17:41.061 --> 17:43.439
<i>With all due respect, sir, I don't think
the Secretary of Defense</i>

17:43.605 --> 17:44.648
<i>is going to be happy about that.</i>

17:44.815 --> 17:47.651
Yeah, well, fuck the Secretary of Defense.

17:49.403 --> 17:52.030
Mr. President, the girl you asked for.

17:58.162 --> 17:59.246
She's coming with me.

17:59.413 --> 18:00.456
Sir, she's a civilian.

18:00.622 --> 18:02.499
She can't travel in the presidential limo.

18:02.666 --> 18:04.293
She's coming with me alone.

18:05.836 --> 18:07.421
That's an order.

18:12.134 --> 18:13.844
Looks like rain.

18:26.690 --> 18:28.150
Do you know who I am?

18:28.650 --> 18:29.818
Yes.

18:33.697 --> 18:37.201
Do you know that I'm not
the President of the United States?

18:38.660 --> 18:40.037
I sure do.

18:43.749 --> 18:46.210
I have a message for you from your father.

18:49.671 --> 18:51.006
My father?

18:52.883 --> 18:53.967
John.

18:55.052 --> 18:57.054
He wants me to tell you...

18:58.764 --> 19:01.725
He wants you to know

19:01.892 --> 19:03.560
that you're loved.

19:11.360 --> 19:13.570
Is there anything you want me to tell him?

19:16.824 --> 19:18.784
Are you fucking serious?

19:20.410 --> 19:22.913
My father was murdered.

19:23.580 --> 19:26.333
My mother, my brother,

19:26.500 --> 19:27.751
all of them gone in an instant

19:27.918 --> 19:30.003
because of a drone strike ordered
by your administration.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.381
No. No, that's not what happened.

19:32.548 --> 19:33.966
You were killed.

19:34.132 --> 19:35.759
What?

19:35.926 --> 19:39.096
I'm not dead.
I'm right fucking here, asshole.

19:41.431 --> 19:43.433
You said you knew
that I wasn't the president.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.768
You're not!

19:44.935 --> 19:46.436
You're just a puppet.

19:46.770 --> 19:48.313
<i>That speech you just gave?</i>

19:48.522 --> 19:50.107
<i>Were those even your words?</i>

19:50.440 --> 19:53.610
Because it didn't sound like you believed
a single thing you were saying.

19:53.777 --> 19:55.153
You just do what they tell you to do.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.781
- That's not true.
<i>- Yeah, it is.</i>

19:58.657 --> 20:00.284
What do you want?

20:08.792 --> 20:09.960
Are you okay?

20:13.380 --> 20:14.464
Stop!

20:14.631 --> 20:16.341
<i>Stop the car!</i>

20:16.508 --> 20:18.051
<i>You need to stop the car!</i>

21:03.055 --> 21:04.348
All right, stand back.

21:04.598 --> 21:06.308
Give him some air.

21:07.809 --> 21:09.603
I was just with Evie.

21:13.607 --> 21:15.692
You... You saw her?

21:17.486 --> 21:19.488
I delivered your message.

21:34.878 --> 21:36.880
Your children were there, too.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.301
All of them?

21:42.386 --> 21:44.054
Yeah, all of them.

21:45.055 --> 21:46.807
They were all okay?

21:49.643 --> 21:52.646
They didn't know what happened
to their shoes.

22:07.285 --> 22:09.079
Did you get the song?

22:10.288 --> 22:12.249
I was working on it.

22:12.833 --> 22:14.376
Why'd you pull me out of the pond?

22:14.584 --> 22:17.587
There is no pond.
The whole fucking ranch is flooded.

22:20.549 --> 22:22.509
Take me to the bathroom.

22:26.722 --> 22:27.764
<i>Whoa, hold on.</i>

22:27.931 --> 22:29.266
- You can't keep doing this.
- Yes, he can.

22:29.433 --> 22:30.475
No, look at him!

22:30.684 --> 22:33.061
<i>You got what you wanted.
Now you're worried about him?</i>

22:33.228 --> 22:35.230
Out there is the goddamn flood.

22:35.397 --> 22:38.233
That's why we're fucking doing this.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.568
It's not why he's doing this.

22:40.944 --> 22:42.612
Why else would I be doing this?

22:46.825 --> 22:48.618
I don't know. Why would you?

22:52.122 --> 22:53.790
- Out!
- No. No!

22:54.750 --> 22:56.293
<i>Come on! Kevin!</i>

22:56.460 --> 22:58.462
<i>- Dad, stop.
- Don't do this!</i>

22:58.628 --> 23:01.131
<i>- Kevin!</i>
- Everyone's got a fucking opinion.

23:01.298 --> 23:04.051
<i>- Kevin!
- Dad, stop. Let's go.</i>

23:10.974 --> 23:12.267
You okay?

23:14.644 --> 23:15.896
I'm cold.

23:17.314 --> 23:20.692
If I could do this instead of you,
I would.

23:23.111 --> 23:24.321
I know.

23:25.655 --> 23:29.826
But the secure location can only be
accessed by my exact biometrics.

23:31.161 --> 23:33.747
Is that supposed
to make sense to me?

23:37.000 --> 23:39.127
It doesn't make sense to me.

23:48.011 --> 23:49.596
I love you, son.

23:52.099 --> 23:53.683
I love you, too.

24:02.609 --> 24:05.028
You're gonna have to hold me down.

24:40.605 --> 24:42.357
You all right, sir?

24:45.443 --> 24:46.570
Yeah.

24:46.903 --> 24:49.322
I need to talk to the, uh,
Australian Prime Minister.

24:49.865 --> 24:52.659
- Sorry?
- The Australian Prime Minister.

24:52.826 --> 24:54.953
Christopher Sunday.
I need to talk to him right now.

24:55.704 --> 24:57.747
Well, sir, there's a secure
comms room inside the bunker.

24:57.914 --> 25:00.709
We just need to confirm your ID,
and you can talk to whoever you want.

25:01.793 --> 25:03.420
Just wanna try the
scanner again, please, sir.

25:06.047 --> 25:07.132
Yeah.

25:11.553 --> 25:13.305
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

25:13.638 --> 25:14.973
Excellent.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.439
Now your penis, please, sir.

25:23.940 --> 25:25.400
- My what?
- Your penis.

25:26.443 --> 25:28.111
Place it on the other scanner,
please, sir.

25:29.779 --> 25:30.864
Why?

25:31.781 --> 25:34.409
Mr. President,
due to advancements in plastic surgery,

25:34.576 --> 25:36.953
anyone with enough resources
can copy a person's face.

25:39.164 --> 25:40.749
But your, uh...

25:40.957 --> 25:44.002
Your penis, sir, well, they're
not gonna go to that length.

26:05.148 --> 26:07.108
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

26:07.317 --> 26:08.318
Confirmed.

26:15.450 --> 26:16.576
Can we go in now?

26:16.743 --> 26:19.746
Uh, just the three
authentication questions, sir.

26:23.416 --> 26:25.835
What was the name
of your favorite childhood pet?

26:26.169 --> 26:28.588
We didn't have one. My mom was allergic.

26:29.047 --> 26:30.048
Correct.

26:30.215 --> 26:31.341
Your favorite movie?

26:33.009 --> 26:34.344
Uh, <i>Godfather.</i>

26:36.179 --> 26:37.430
Part two.

26:38.473 --> 26:39.599
Correct.

26:39.766 --> 26:42.185
Name your secretary of defense?

26:42.852 --> 26:44.020
Um...

26:49.567 --> 26:51.861
Sir, I need a name.

26:58.118 --> 26:59.703
Patti Levin.

27:03.999 --> 27:05.292
Correct.

27:47.083 --> 27:49.252
Good to see you, Mr. President.

27:54.591 --> 27:56.176
I wish the circumstances were different,

27:56.343 --> 27:59.471
but it appears
the shit has hit the fan, sir.

27:59.637 --> 28:01.973
Let's get to the situation room.

28:12.859 --> 28:15.653
Mr. President,
for reasons I cannot fathom,

28:15.820 --> 28:17.947
we remain at DEFCON 3.

28:20.408 --> 28:23.620
This is the case containing
the nuclear football,

28:23.787 --> 28:26.790
which will give you
remote launch capability.

28:33.463 --> 28:35.215
What's in that one?

28:35.465 --> 28:37.008
Never mind about that.

28:37.258 --> 28:39.469
Just pray we don't have to open it.

28:43.264 --> 28:46.726
Sir, in order to arm the device,

28:46.893 --> 28:50.522
you need to verbally take
us down to DEFCON 1.

28:52.148 --> 28:54.567
You are aware of the situation, yes?

28:54.901 --> 28:57.320
- Yeah, of course...
- So, you know, sir,

28:57.821 --> 29:02.534
that Ukrainian separatists have
seized control of a nuclear submarine.

29:03.326 --> 29:05.995
They will be weapons hot
in less than an hour.

29:06.496 --> 29:09.833
Our only option is to strike first.

29:10.250 --> 29:13.878
Which is why you need to
take us down to DEFCON 1.

29:18.425 --> 29:21.511
Uh, I have to make a phone call first.

29:22.262 --> 29:23.471
To who?

29:23.930 --> 29:26.182
The Prime Minister of Australia.

29:31.104 --> 29:34.107
Gentlemen, can the President
and I have the room, please?

29:40.029 --> 29:41.698
Yes, if you can...

29:49.914 --> 29:52.041
What the fuck is wrong with you?

29:52.750 --> 29:55.336
All this time, years of planning.

29:55.503 --> 29:57.839
We are minutes away
from making this happen,

29:58.006 --> 30:00.341
and you are dicking around about DEFCON 1!

30:00.508 --> 30:02.260
- I don't have...
- You don't have any what?

30:02.427 --> 30:03.845
You don't have any balls?

30:04.012 --> 30:05.138
What?

30:07.432 --> 30:10.059
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. President,
but the Vice President is here

30:10.226 --> 30:11.769
and she's demanding to speak to you.

30:12.353 --> 30:13.354
She?

30:13.521 --> 30:14.522
Fuck her.

30:14.689 --> 30:16.441
Tell her to go away.

30:18.568 --> 30:20.069
She doesn't know about this.

30:21.237 --> 30:23.907
- Let her in.
- Yes, sir, of course.

30:24.699 --> 30:26.242
Madam Vice President.

30:36.586 --> 30:39.214
You're being played, sir.

30:42.592 --> 30:43.593
What?

30:43.760 --> 30:45.261
You're being played.

30:45.929 --> 30:47.430
I just got off the phone with the Kremlin

30:47.597 --> 30:49.724
who confirms that there is no submarine.

30:49.933 --> 30:51.142
No separatists.

30:51.309 --> 30:52.602
This is a smoke screen.

30:52.810 --> 30:55.021
You have been fed bogus Intel.

31:01.152 --> 31:03.988
I don't get fed, I feed.

31:04.155 --> 31:07.784
And you clearly have no goddamn idea
what's happening around here.

31:08.034 --> 31:09.118
Then enlighten me.

31:09.285 --> 31:11.996
I couldn't enlighten you with
a fucking 1,000-watt bulb.

31:13.748 --> 31:15.875
- Tell her about the plan.
<i>- I'm not telling herjack shit.</i>

31:16.042 --> 31:19.254
If you want me to bring us down to
DEFCON 1, tell her.

31:21.798 --> 31:23.132
Fine.

31:23.299 --> 31:27.470
We are going to vaporize every man, woman,
and child on the planet.

31:29.973 --> 31:32.225
It's the seventh anniversary
of the departure,

31:32.392 --> 31:36.062
and there is reasonable expectation
out there that the world's gonna end.

31:36.229 --> 31:39.023
So, we're gonna fire
our nukes at the Russians

31:39.190 --> 31:41.609
and they're gonna retaliate,
and then that's it.

31:41.776 --> 31:43.403
We're all torched.

31:43.820 --> 31:47.740
No one wakes up tomorrow disappointed that
nothing fucking happened.

31:47.907 --> 31:51.953
We give the people what they're
too chickenshit to do themselves.

31:52.620 --> 31:54.622
What they elected us for.

31:55.415 --> 31:57.375
<i>We give them what they want.</i>

31:58.793 --> 32:00.587
And they want to die.

32:03.006 --> 32:04.924
Well, that's not gonna work.

32:05.091 --> 32:08.011
You can't launch without going through
the Fisher Protocol.

32:09.095 --> 32:11.931
You know about the Fisher Protocol?

32:15.643 --> 32:17.186
Of course I do.

32:18.563 --> 32:19.564
Prove it.

32:21.691 --> 32:23.818
It's an ethical deterrent.

32:26.195 --> 32:30.533
The nuclear launch key was surgically
embedded into the heart of a volunteer.

32:30.700 --> 32:34.370
In order for the president to be able
to blow up millions of people

32:34.621 --> 32:38.082
with the push of a button,
he has to extract that key

32:38.249 --> 32:40.752
by murdering the volunteer himself.

32:42.629 --> 32:46.049
But since I don't see that volunteer here,
you can't launch shit.

32:55.433 --> 32:56.559
What?

32:58.936 --> 33:04.525
The volunteer is coming through the east
entrance of this facility in 15 minutes.

33:09.113 --> 33:11.574
And how is he gonna make it
through the security door?

33:16.954 --> 33:18.748
He's my identical twin brother.

33:24.587 --> 33:25.963
Well...

33:27.548 --> 33:31.094
It sounds like you two have
really thought this through.

33:37.642 --> 33:40.687
I guess I should go, uh,
handle my affairs.

33:42.271 --> 33:43.981
I guess you should.

33:46.025 --> 33:47.527
Mr. President.

33:48.736 --> 33:49.779
Yeah.

34:00.748 --> 34:02.500
All righty, sir.

34:02.667 --> 34:04.961
May we go down to DEFCON 1 now?

34:06.963 --> 34:09.006
I just need to make my call.

34:09.424 --> 34:12.844
You can make your call after
you take us to DEFCON 1.

34:14.178 --> 34:16.889
Just say it into the device.

34:28.401 --> 34:30.069
We're at DEFCON 1.

34:52.550 --> 34:53.926
What the fuck!

34:54.135 --> 34:55.428
What the fuck?

34:55.845 --> 34:56.846
You can't leave, sir.

34:57.013 --> 34:59.140
Your order initiated a full lockdown.

35:00.767 --> 35:03.144
I told you I had to make a fucking call!

35:05.188 --> 35:06.314
Hey!

35:31.547 --> 35:33.925
<i>Do you have eyes on the entrance?</i>

35:40.389 --> 35:42.225
- Yeah, I see it.
<i>- Good.</i>

35:42.725 --> 35:45.228
<i>Take out the Secret Service
agents and get in there.</i>

35:46.187 --> 35:48.439
There are no Secret Service agents.

35:54.237 --> 35:55.279
It's a trap.

35:55.488 --> 35:57.156
They want me to go in.

35:57.323 --> 35:58.449
They wanna cut me open.

35:58.658 --> 36:00.535
<i>Do you think I don't know that?</i>

36:00.701 --> 36:02.578
Well, if you knew that,
why the fuck wouldn't you tell me?

36:02.745 --> 36:04.997
<i>Because I'm covering my asset.</i>

36:05.665 --> 36:07.959
- What asset?
<i>- I have someone on the inside.</i>

36:08.209 --> 36:09.836
<i>Leave your weapon, enter the door,</i>

36:10.002 --> 36:12.296
<i>and they'll take
care of you once you're inside.</i>

36:12.463 --> 36:13.756
You want me to go in there without a gun?

36:13.923 --> 36:17.718
<i>"Hence it comes about that all unarmed
prophets have been victorious,</i>

36:17.885 --> 36:20.513
<i>"and all armed prophets
have been destroyed."</i>

36:20.805 --> 36:22.765
<i>That's from Machiavelli.</i>

36:24.684 --> 36:26.602
<i>Put your faith in me, Mr. Harvey.</i>

36:38.030 --> 36:39.866
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

37:18.446 --> 37:19.488
Stop right there!

37:19.655 --> 37:21.073
<i>Stop! Down!</i>

37:21.324 --> 37:22.658
Down on the stairs. Get down!

37:23.659 --> 37:24.744
Show us your hands!

37:24.994 --> 37:26.704
- Show us your fucking hands!
- Here!

37:26.954 --> 37:27.955
<i>Don't move.</i>

37:28.122 --> 37:30.458
Did you fucking sell me out?

37:30.625 --> 37:32.460
Don't you fucking move.

37:32.835 --> 37:34.211
Hey, are you there?

37:34.378 --> 37:36.172
I said don't fucking move!

37:56.609 --> 37:57.777
Jesus.

37:58.444 --> 38:00.196
You look just fucking like him.

38:02.239 --> 38:04.200
The President is in the situation room.

38:04.367 --> 38:07.370
It's in lockdown, but the code is 6969.

38:07.536 --> 38:11.207
And please make sure you fucking
kill the Secretary of Defense.

38:11.374 --> 38:13.292
- Where's the comms room?
- What?

38:13.542 --> 38:15.002
The comms room. I need to make a call.

38:15.211 --> 38:17.046
Do you know what's inside of you?

38:19.048 --> 38:20.091
Yes.

38:20.299 --> 38:22.218
Then you know that
the President will not hesitate

38:22.385 --> 38:25.012
to cut you open and pull it out.

38:25.179 --> 38:26.430
I mean, I know this man.

38:26.597 --> 38:28.641
He is cold and he is merciless.

38:29.725 --> 38:33.104
You think he gives a shit about you
if he's willing to end the world?

38:34.563 --> 38:37.066
I thought that's what you people wanted.

38:38.442 --> 38:39.735
They're all liars.

38:40.194 --> 38:43.990
They say they don't believe in love
and they don't feel pain.

38:45.116 --> 38:46.534
I feel pain.

38:48.411 --> 38:49.578
And I'm in love.

38:49.745 --> 38:53.416
I'm in love with the most
wonderful man I have ever known.

38:53.916 --> 38:56.419
Uh-huh. And who's that?

38:57.253 --> 38:58.838
His name is God.

39:00.798 --> 39:02.800
<i>Tell her I love her, too.</i>

39:06.220 --> 39:07.430
Where's the comms room?

39:07.596 --> 39:10.016
What is it with you
and the fucking comms room?

39:10.182 --> 39:11.350
<i>I thought you were an assassin.</i>

39:11.559 --> 39:13.769
I mean, who do you need
to communicate with?

39:14.979 --> 39:16.230
Well, maybe I'm in love, too.

39:16.397 --> 39:17.565
Oh, please.

39:17.732 --> 39:19.942
Where is the comms room?

39:20.568 --> 39:23.154
It's fucking up the hall, to the right!

39:25.531 --> 39:27.033
<i>What's happening?
What was that noise?</i>

39:27.241 --> 39:29.285
I don't know. You tell me. You're God.

39:29.994 --> 39:31.495
<i>That was just a pick-up line.</i>

39:31.746 --> 39:33.456
<i>Did you fucking kill her?</i>

39:33.622 --> 39:35.374
<i>Hey. Hey, Harvey!</i>

39:35.541 --> 39:36.917
<i>Hey! Harvey!</i>

39:51.348 --> 39:52.850
Mr. President.

39:56.312 --> 39:57.688
You shaved.

39:57.938 --> 40:01.150
I need to talk to
the Prime Minister of Australia.

40:02.068 --> 40:03.402
Christopher Sunday.

40:06.363 --> 40:07.656
Is there a problem, Officer?

40:07.823 --> 40:08.908
No, sir.

40:19.627 --> 40:21.712
He'll come out here, Mr. President.

40:27.134 --> 40:28.969
- Give us the room.
- Sir, this is my post...

40:29.136 --> 40:30.554
Give us the fucking room.

40:51.617 --> 40:52.827
Hello.

40:53.536 --> 40:54.703
<i>Hello.</i>

40:55.704 --> 40:57.623
Are you Christopher Sunday?

40:57.873 --> 40:58.999
<i>Yes.</i>

41:03.712 --> 41:05.506
My name is Kevin,

41:06.841 --> 41:08.968
and I know this is gonna sound crazy,

41:11.053 --> 41:13.430
but you're not
the Prime Minister of Australia.

41:15.891 --> 41:17.393
My father,

41:17.560 --> 41:19.979
he came to you for a song.

41:22.106 --> 41:24.066
A song to stop the rain.

41:26.986 --> 41:29.405
<i>There's no song to stop the rain.</i>

41:33.159 --> 41:34.160
What?

41:34.326 --> 41:36.328
<i>I told your father,</i>

41:36.495 --> 41:38.038
<i>but he didn't listen.</i>

41:38.205 --> 41:41.250
No. No, no, no.
Look, you have to give me something.

41:41.417 --> 41:44.295
I have to bring him something.
He needs this.

41:44.461 --> 41:47.131
- There's a flood.
<i>- Do you believe that?</i>

41:48.549 --> 41:49.800
Believe what?

41:50.009 --> 41:53.804
<i>Do you believe your father
can sing a song and stop the flood?</i>

42:02.271 --> 42:03.439
No.

42:08.944 --> 42:10.821
<i>Then why are you here?</i>

42:20.122 --> 42:21.498
Don't move.

42:47.816 --> 42:51.654
Mr. President, can I have my
glasses back, please?

43:06.502 --> 43:08.295
Sounds like they got him.

43:10.673 --> 43:13.092
I don't wanna do this anymore.

43:13.259 --> 43:14.677
Do what, Mr. President?

43:14.843 --> 43:16.720
Stop fucking calling me that!

43:18.222 --> 43:21.725
I'm not the president! You're not
the fucking secretary of defense.

43:22.101 --> 43:24.687
Oh, yes. Yes, I am.

43:25.521 --> 43:27.690
You named me secretary of defense.

43:27.856 --> 43:30.859
You were asked
who did you want in this position,

43:31.026 --> 43:32.569
and you named me.

43:33.570 --> 43:38.117
You summoned me out of retirement
and I came back

43:38.284 --> 43:40.035
<i>because I owed you.</i>

43:43.706 --> 43:45.416
You helped me, Kevin.

43:47.626 --> 43:49.878
And now I'm here to help you.

43:55.092 --> 43:56.635
Help me how?

43:59.054 --> 44:01.724
Well, what do you want?

44:07.771 --> 44:09.481
I wanna go home.

44:12.651 --> 44:13.986
Do you?

44:15.571 --> 44:16.822
What?

44:17.573 --> 44:21.410
It's just that you've been known
to say that before, and yet,

44:21.577 --> 44:24.246
you keep leaving home and coming here.

44:26.206 --> 44:30.419
I'm sensing a lot of internal
contradictions from you, Kevin.

44:31.754 --> 44:35.132
It sounds like something
you need to work out with yourself.

45:03.327 --> 45:06.372
I'm gonna take these off

45:06.538 --> 45:11.251
because I know you're here
of your own free will,

45:11.418 --> 45:14.171
and the last thing you wanna do

45:14.338 --> 45:15.798
is hurt yourself.

45:21.553 --> 45:24.098
<i>They're Kevins</i>

45:24.431 --> 45:28.310
<i>Identical Kevins all the way</i>

45:28.811 --> 45:31.605
<i>One pair of matching bookends</i>

45:32.022 --> 45:35.651
<i>Different as night and day</i>

45:37.486 --> 45:39.196
All right, gentlemen.

45:39.363 --> 45:41.573
<i>Let's get to the hard part, shall we?</i>

45:45.494 --> 45:49.289
I, Patricia Levin, in my capacity
as secretary of defense,

45:49.456 --> 45:51.792
hereby invoke the Fisher Protocol,

45:51.959 --> 45:54.002
overriding the Heart Deterrent.

45:54.378 --> 45:57.172
Pursuant to the nuclear command authority

45:57.381 --> 46:00.717
<i>granted by Article II, Section 2
of the US Constitution,</i>

46:00.884 --> 46:02.678
the president shall make an incision

46:02.845 --> 46:06.014
two inches below the sternum
of the volunteer, that's you,

46:06.181 --> 46:08.684
<i>whereupon the president,</i>

46:08.851 --> 46:11.270
gaining access from beneath the ribcage,

46:11.437 --> 46:14.022
shall manually extract the launch key

46:14.189 --> 46:16.233
from behind the left atria.

46:17.317 --> 46:19.528
<i>In recognition of his service,</i>

46:19.695 --> 46:23.699
<i>the volunteer shall receive a posthumous
Congressional Medal of Honor</i>

46:23.866 --> 46:26.368
<i>applicable if Congress exists,</i>

46:26.535 --> 46:28.620
which it will not.

46:28.787 --> 46:32.624
May God have mercy on your soul
if there is a God,

46:32.791 --> 46:34.543
which there is not.

46:56.023 --> 46:57.566
I'm not fucking killing him.

46:57.733 --> 46:59.818
Good, because I'm not fucking letting him.

46:59.985 --> 47:01.403
Gentlemen, language.

47:01.570 --> 47:03.739
Fuck you!

47:04.114 --> 47:06.241
I'm not understanding the problem.

47:06.825 --> 47:11.622
The problem is that this is stupid!
I don't care about any of this bullshit.

47:11.788 --> 47:13.916
- It doesn't make any sense!
- It doesn't?

47:14.082 --> 47:17.294
No! Why the fuck
would I volunteer to be cut open?

47:17.461 --> 47:19.004
I don't know. Why would you?

47:19.171 --> 47:21.924
- I wouldn't!
- And yet here you are.

47:22.758 --> 47:25.177
Knowing full well what is inside of you,

47:25.344 --> 47:28.388
you kept moving forward
towards this very room

47:28.555 --> 47:31.725
and the one person
powerful enough to take it out.

47:36.647 --> 47:39.399
I think you should tell him
about the book you wrote.

47:42.236 --> 47:43.779
What book?

47:44.446 --> 47:46.448
The romance novel.

47:46.865 --> 47:49.535
That's him.
He wrote it. That's him.

47:49.785 --> 47:52.496
- What? No. No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.

47:52.663 --> 47:55.666
It's the one that was in the typewriter
in the fucking beach house.

47:55.832 --> 47:57.417
I know. I was there,

47:57.584 --> 47:59.878
- but it's not fucking mine.
<i>- Boys, boys.</i>

48:00.045 --> 48:02.839
I think we can all agree
you both wrote the same book.

48:03.006 --> 48:04.591
No, we didn't!

48:06.260 --> 48:09.137
Well, I'm sorry it's come to this,

48:09.304 --> 48:10.639
but I have no choice.

48:12.140 --> 48:14.142
<i>I received a call from the CIA</i>

48:14.309 --> 48:17.104
that the President
was keeping a secret journal

48:17.437 --> 48:20.691
hidden behind the portrait
of Millard Fillmore in the Oval.

48:21.942 --> 48:25.070
As this was clearly
a national security issue,

48:25.237 --> 48:27.656
I had no choice but to procure it.

48:30.534 --> 48:32.494
I'd like you to read this for us.

48:34.663 --> 48:35.664
No.

48:39.251 --> 48:40.335
What about you?

48:41.336 --> 48:42.337
No.

48:44.715 --> 48:46.008
Fine,

48:46.174 --> 48:47.676
I'll do it myself.

49:00.230 --> 49:02.357
Sorry, I just need my glasses.

49:12.200 --> 49:13.910
For fuck's sake.

49:19.333 --> 49:22.628
"Untitled Romance Novel.

49:26.798 --> 49:29.343
- "Chapter One."
- Just read the last page.

Ending's better.

49:39.061 --> 49:41.647
"The port was alive with strange faces.

51:56.823 --> 51:59.493
So we can't ever come back here again.

We fucked up with Nora.

Let's go watch.

57:49.008 --> 57:50.969
I thought you were gone.

57:58.852 --> 58:02.063
It was raining so hard and I got scared.

58:03.523 --> 58:06.109
So I came up here.

58:09.320 --> 58:10.488
Okay.

58:16.244 --> 58:18.872
I don't think I'm ready to come down.
