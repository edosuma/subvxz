00:20.220 --> 00:24.580
_

00:29.660 --> 00:30.910
Are you allowed to do that?

00:31.530 --> 00:32.530
What do you mean?

00:33.050 --> 00:34.440
Put nails in the wall.

00:34.540 --> 00:36.990
We can do what we like, babe.
We own it.

00:37.020 --> 00:38.020
Oh, yeah.

00:38.580 --> 00:39.870
I can't quite believe it.

00:40.090 --> 00:42.800
I can't believe we got 100
grand off the asking price.

00:43.090 --> 00:44.830
But, then again,
under the circumstances...

00:44.860 --> 00:45.950
Don't, Sam.

00:47.500 --> 00:48.720
I don't want to think about it.

00:50.260 --> 00:51.840
So does that make
us grown-ups now?

00:52.770 --> 00:54.630
We'll be having dinner parties.

00:54.660 --> 00:57.230
Talking about
catchment areas next.

00:57.260 --> 00:58.800
- Well, maybe we should.
- What?

00:58.940 --> 01:00.100
Might be nice to invite
the neighbours round.

01:00.130 --> 01:01.430
Have a bit of a flat warming.

01:02.700 --> 01:04.349
- Nah.
- Why not?

01:04.459 --> 01:07.480
I don't want people treating
it like a guided tour.

01:08.300 --> 01:10.380
"Let's go and look round
that serial killer's flat."

01:10.410 --> 01:13.430
Bea, it's not a serial
killer's flat, OK?

01:13.820 --> 01:15.700
It was one dismembered body...

01:15.730 --> 01:16.990
that they know of.

01:17.020 --> 01:17.980
What?!

01:18.010 --> 01:21.230
I'm kidding!
Look, it was a long time ago.

01:21.260 --> 01:23.710
They replaced all the numbers,
I'm sure no-one really remembers.

01:23.740 --> 01:24.840
I'll remember it.

01:24.900 --> 01:26.430
I'll remember it every
time I'm in that bath

01:26.460 --> 01:27.870
where there's been
a body chopped up.

01:27.900 --> 01:30.150
Nah, they replaced the bath.
The agent said.

01:30.180 --> 01:32.530
- Oh, and you now believe what estate agents say, do you?
- I believe

01:32.560 --> 01:35.740
we've got a quarter of a million
pound flat at half the price.

01:36.260 --> 01:38.550
- What time are you back?
- About half four.

01:39.490 --> 01:40.590
I hate it when you work nights.

01:40.620 --> 01:42.910
Yeah, me too.
That's when mistakes happen.

01:43.180 --> 01:44.990
Like poor Mr
Hargreaves last night.

01:45.340 --> 01:47.400
They actually told
me to prick his boil.

01:48.620 --> 01:49.620
Sam...!

01:51.380 --> 01:52.380
I'll see you later.

02:01.980 --> 02:03.200
Oh, for God's sake.

04:08.010 --> 04:09.120
Beattie, what's wrong?

04:11.540 --> 04:12.560
We need to move.

04:13.540 --> 04:14.540
Yeah.

04:14.900 --> 04:16.040
Yeah, that would be great.

04:16.649 --> 04:17.649
Thank you.

04:19.209 --> 04:21.100
Right, they're going to try and get
in touch with the previous owner,

04:21.130 --> 04:22.560
see if he can shed any light.

04:23.740 --> 04:26.030
Babe, I'm sure it's just
because you're unsettled.

04:26.060 --> 04:28.120
You know, thinking about
the whole unpleasantness.

04:28.300 --> 04:29.180
You are susceptible...

04:29.210 --> 04:30.660
I know what I saw, Sam!

04:31.650 --> 04:33.510
I didn't put the Hoover on the
table and you certainly didn't

04:33.540 --> 04:34.950
because you've never
touched it in your life!

04:34.980 --> 04:36.600
Right, well,
we've done what we can.

04:36.890 --> 04:38.100
Ok?

04:39.450 --> 04:41.390
I'm tired.
I'm going to go for a shower.

04:41.420 --> 04:44.350
And, uh, don't worry - if
blood starts coming out of it,

04:44.380 --> 04:46.820
I promise we can move. OK?

05:32.010 --> 05:33.010
Hello?

05:41.500 --> 05:42.500
Hello.

05:42.570 --> 05:45.950
I'm David Sowerbutts,
and I used to live here.

05:49.700 --> 05:51.830
- Are you sure you don't want a cup of tea?
- No, thank you.

05:53.260 --> 05:54.440
Do you have a smoothie?

05:56.650 --> 05:57.650
No.

05:57.740 --> 05:59.390
I haven't done a big shop yet.

06:00.380 --> 06:01.950
Not long moved in,
as you can see.

06:01.980 --> 06:04.760
My mum used to make me
smoothies with a machine.

06:06.540 --> 06:07.540
A blender?

06:07.650 --> 06:09.360
No, her name was Maureen.

06:09.890 --> 06:11.390
She used to live here, too.

06:12.570 --> 06:14.060
These were her eyes.

06:15.980 --> 06:16.980
Sorry?

06:17.420 --> 06:19.390
She used to dress up
and do impressions.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.200
Party nights,
that sort of thing.

06:21.820 --> 06:23.680
She used these for Tina Turner.

06:25.450 --> 06:26.450
Right.

06:27.770 --> 06:29.100
Well, it's very strange.

06:29.130 --> 06:32.120
They've just appeared
in the hallway.

06:35.700 --> 06:36.920
I hate to ask, but...

06:37.820 --> 06:39.630
did your mother pass
away in this flat?

06:41.890 --> 06:43.360
She did, yes.

06:44.770 --> 06:46.850
But I don't like to
remember her that way.

06:48.620 --> 06:50.800
I remember her
being full of life.

07:20.570 --> 07:22.040
We got on really well.

07:22.540 --> 07:24.200
We were more than flatmates.

07:24.700 --> 07:26.510
Well, you were mother and son.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.800
Oh, yeah, that as well.

07:28.890 --> 07:29.890
Is that all of it?

07:36.380 --> 07:38.000
I think it's dry now.

07:40.330 --> 07:41.560
I know it is.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.680
We took an interest in
each other's hobbies.

07:50.100 --> 07:52.120
Mum liked to play the Bontempi.

07:53.450 --> 07:55.860
I liked learning
about serial killers.

07:55.890 --> 07:59.600
Did I meow like a cat
when I was arrested?

07:59.660 --> 08:02.200
- No.
- Right, so I'm not Jeffrey Dahmer. Your go.

08:02.700 --> 08:04.710
Did I kill a family member?

08:04.740 --> 08:06.030
- Yep.
- Wife?

08:06.060 --> 08:07.100
Yeah, you're warm.

08:07.130 --> 08:08.540
John Reginald Halliday Christie?

08:08.570 --> 08:10.830
No. Dr Crippen. I win.

08:11.260 --> 08:12.980
Crippen's not a serial killer.

08:13.010 --> 08:14.860
He only killed his wife.
It's nothing.

08:14.890 --> 08:17.510
Yeah, don't be a bad loser,
David. You were close.

08:17.740 --> 08:19.720
They've both got bald
heads and round glasses.

08:19.890 --> 08:21.070
Who was I, anyway?

08:21.700 --> 08:24.670
Ed Gein! I should have asked, "Did
I dance around in the moonlight

08:24.700 --> 08:26.920
with a silver
vagina on me face?"!

08:27.700 --> 08:28.700
She sounds...

08:29.540 --> 08:30.270
..lovely.

08:30.300 --> 08:33.630
She was.
We were very happy here.

08:34.940 --> 08:37.559
But, then, one day,
I found out she'd caught cancer.

08:39.490 --> 08:42.070
- I'm sorry.
- Well, it's not your fault!

08:44.610 --> 08:46.420
She was very brave about it.

08:47.660 --> 08:48.660
There.

08:48.940 --> 08:50.540
Now, I've cut you a little
bit behind your ear,

08:50.570 --> 08:53.160
- but it'll scab over.
- Thanks, Mum.

08:53.330 --> 08:55.230
You're going to have to learn how
to do all these things for yourself

08:55.260 --> 08:56.260
when I'm gone.

08:56.420 --> 08:58.470
- Don't say that.
- Well, you will.

08:58.900 --> 09:01.070
What did your scoutmaster
used to say to you?

09:01.820 --> 09:02.940
Don't tell anyone.

09:02.970 --> 09:04.440
Yeah... Not that.

09:04.970 --> 09:06.400
Be prepared.

09:06.940 --> 09:09.230
You need to be equipped
with essential life skills.

09:09.260 --> 09:10.260
I am!

09:10.540 --> 09:16.030
Left, right, stalagmites, stalactites,
cos mites crawl up and tights hang down.

09:16.060 --> 09:18.390
OK, that's good,
but there are other things.

09:18.420 --> 09:19.950
You've got to be able
to feed yourself.

09:20.300 --> 09:21.630
I'll have a flask of beans.

09:21.660 --> 09:24.700
Oh, you need more than that.
I'll leave you my recipes.

09:24.730 --> 09:28.030
You can do carbonara - which is
spaghetti hoops in salad cream

09:28.060 --> 09:29.560
with a bag of Frazzles mixed in.

09:30.020 --> 09:32.710
And, for pudding, you can
have me New York cheesecake -

09:32.940 --> 09:35.040
Dairylea triangle
on a digestive.

09:35.780 --> 09:37.230
I don't want you to go.

09:38.060 --> 09:39.850
I know you don't, David.

09:40.020 --> 09:41.440
And I don't want to go.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.470
Let's hope it's a long way off,
eh?

09:46.970 --> 09:48.000
But it wasn't.

09:48.330 --> 09:50.110
I wish I could kill Death.

09:51.060 --> 09:53.070
Then he wouldn't be
able to kill you.

09:55.180 --> 09:57.800
You can't have a world
without Death, David.

09:59.940 --> 10:01.640
He finds you in the end.

10:03.140 --> 10:07.590
"One short sleep past, we wake
eternally, and death shall be no more.

10:08.660 --> 10:11.520
Death, thou shalt die."

10:13.540 --> 10:15.070
Did you just make that up?

10:16.090 --> 10:17.550
No, John Donne.

10:19.260 --> 10:21.520
It's "John did", David.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.150
_

10:23.180 --> 10:24.660
It's "John did".

10:49.300 --> 10:52.400
Without Mum, things were
harder than I thought.

10:57.260 --> 10:58.400
She was right.

10:59.780 --> 11:02.240
I wasn't equipped
with many life skills.

11:06.090 --> 11:09.200
But luckily I had a friend
who came to look after me.

11:10.900 --> 11:13.590
Hello, David.
I brought you a smoothie.

11:13.970 --> 11:15.560
- Mango?
- Yeah.

11:15.660 --> 11:16.660
Thank you.

11:25.300 --> 11:28.520
I met Emily at my job doing
Murder Mystery Evenings.

11:29.210 --> 11:32.580
We bonded over our shared
passion for Jack the Ripper.

11:32.610 --> 11:35.350
- Nichols, Tabram, Chapman...
- No, no, no.

11:35.500 --> 11:39.440
Martha Tabram was not considered
one of the canonical five!

11:39.610 --> 11:43.830
Oh, yeah. So, Nichols, Chapman,

11:45.380 --> 11:46.930
NCSEK!

11:46.960 --> 11:50.630
Nichols, Chapman, Stride,
Eddowes, Kelly NCSEK!

11:50.660 --> 11:51.800
That's it.

11:52.610 --> 11:54.580
You are so clever, David.

11:54.610 --> 11:55.800
Thank you.

11:56.380 --> 11:59.920
I know, let's both say our
favourite victim after three.

12:01.140 --> 12:02.140
One...

12:02.780 --> 12:03.780
two...

12:05.500 --> 12:05.910
three...

12:05.940 --> 12:07.200
Mary Kelly!

12:10.380 --> 12:11.500
I need a wee.

12:12.140 --> 12:13.640
Would you like to come with me?

12:14.020 --> 12:15.210
Yes, please.

12:20.330 --> 12:24.400
She encouraged me to make a fresh
start and move on with my life.

13:04.450 --> 13:09.830
I came to realise that, with Emily, I
was filling a hole where Mum had been.

13:15.140 --> 13:17.180
Excuse me,
do you have any Wagon Wheels?

13:19.260 --> 13:20.700
No. Sorry.

13:20.730 --> 13:22.520
Well, it doesn't matter.
I just like them.

13:23.700 --> 13:25.440
So did Emily move in here, then?

13:25.570 --> 13:26.510
Yes.

13:26.540 --> 13:29.470
For a while,
everything was fine, and then...

13:31.260 --> 13:32.830
it all started to go wrong.

13:34.500 --> 13:35.640
David?

13:35.940 --> 13:37.680
Just going to the shops.

13:38.300 --> 13:40.230
Haven't seen my keys, have you?
Agh!

13:47.420 --> 13:48.880
What's going on?

13:49.680 --> 13:51.700
Why have you got
my mum's brooch?

13:51.940 --> 13:53.250
It was in my bag.

13:54.060 --> 13:56.270
If you want to keep any of
her things, I don't mind.

13:56.300 --> 13:57.440
Not bothered.

13:57.660 --> 13:59.400
Well,
I noticed you brought that back.

14:00.730 --> 14:01.880
I didn't.

14:03.060 --> 14:05.400
It's OK, David. I understand.

14:06.260 --> 14:08.520
Your mother was a big
part of your life.

14:09.260 --> 14:11.580
I can see why you wouldn't
want to let her go.

14:12.660 --> 14:13.800
See you tonight.

14:56.300 --> 14:58.440
What are you doing getting
rid of all my things?

15:00.160 --> 15:01.160
Mum?!

15:01.280 --> 15:03.420
You know that blue cardie
you got me for Mother's Day?

15:03.450 --> 15:07.610
It's currently in Wood Green Dogs
Trust with a sticker on it for 30p.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.530
How do you think
that makes me feel?

15:09.800 --> 15:11.080
I'm sorry.

15:11.770 --> 15:13.740
Emily said I should
try to move on.

15:13.770 --> 15:15.800
Never mind what Emily said.

15:16.090 --> 15:17.420
I've seen what you
get up to in here.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.340
I'm disgusted with you.

15:19.370 --> 15:21.200
What do you mean,
you've seen us?

15:21.330 --> 15:22.420
Do you hide in a cupboard?

15:22.450 --> 15:23.740
I don't need to hide, do I?

15:23.770 --> 15:26.410
I'm beyond the veil!
I can do this...

15:28.970 --> 15:31.050
You've got superpowers!

15:32.370 --> 15:34.650
Could you go and watch
the Queen doing a poo?

15:34.680 --> 15:35.920
Yeah, I have done.

15:36.010 --> 15:37.490
She takes ages.

15:38.450 --> 15:41.540
What's it like? The afterlife?

15:41.570 --> 15:43.060
Well, there's different areas.

15:43.090 --> 15:44.100
It's like a cruise ship.

15:44.130 --> 15:47.460
I haven't got access to what you'd
call "the upper deck", but...

15:47.490 --> 15:51.250
I'm telling you, David,
it's much more fun down below.

15:51.730 --> 15:52.940
What do you mean?

15:52.970 --> 15:56.560
I've met 'em all - Bundy,
Chikatilo, Nilsen...

15:56.730 --> 15:58.650
Jeffrey did his cat
noises for me last night.

15:58.680 --> 16:00.050
He's a scream.

16:00.650 --> 16:02.170
I knew he would be!

16:02.570 --> 16:03.940
I can't wait to tell Emily.

16:03.970 --> 16:05.890
You'll tell her nothing!

16:06.650 --> 16:08.250
She's a whore!

16:09.370 --> 16:14.250
She is my girlfriend
and I love her very much.

16:15.210 --> 16:16.890
- And do you trust her?
- Yes.

16:19.160 --> 16:20.170
Why?

16:20.520 --> 16:23.770
Cos I'm in this flat all day,
David, and I see things.

16:23.890 --> 16:28.010
You might want to come home early
one day - say, Wednesday, two o'clock.

16:28.370 --> 16:32.650
And while you're on it, why don't you
ask her why she's got two mobile phones?

16:33.210 --> 16:34.320
What?

16:43.800 --> 16:44.740
Hello?

16:44.770 --> 16:46.490
Oh, hey, is Emily there?

16:46.520 --> 16:47.730
No, sorry.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.490
Would you like to
leave a mess...?

16:56.970 --> 16:58.580
That must have been very scary.

16:58.610 --> 16:59.850
It was.

17:01.090 --> 17:04.530
But not as scary as what I saw
on Wednesday at two o'clock.

17:11.329 --> 17:14.579
If you want to lie back.
That's it.

17:14.609 --> 17:16.930
Go on,
have a little suck on that.

17:18.329 --> 17:21.800
Ooh, you are a big boy,
aren't you?

17:22.609 --> 17:25.290
That's it. How does that feel?

17:25.569 --> 17:27.119
Nice and tight.

17:31.480 --> 17:32.840
Emily?!

17:33.890 --> 17:36.540
David. Why are
you back so early?

17:36.570 --> 17:38.930
What's going on?
Who are all these people?

17:40.810 --> 17:42.770
It's OK. It's only David.

17:44.530 --> 17:46.100
Me not like David!

17:46.130 --> 17:47.820
Want him to go!

17:47.850 --> 17:50.500
Robin?! What are you doing here?

17:50.530 --> 17:52.980
Me not Robin! Me Sally-Ann!

17:53.010 --> 17:57.210
Sally-Ann fwightened!
Sally-Ann go poo-poo!

17:57.240 --> 17:58.980
No Sally-Ann, no poo-poos.

17:59.010 --> 18:00.530
We've just changed your nappy.

18:01.090 --> 18:03.360
You...you play with this.

18:03.650 --> 18:06.170
Just going to talk to David.

18:07.240 --> 18:09.370
David,
I know what this looks like.

18:09.400 --> 18:12.500
It looks like you're having
a sex game with our ex-boss!

18:12.530 --> 18:14.340
No, it's not a sex game.

18:14.370 --> 18:16.600
They pay me to treat
them like this.

18:16.770 --> 18:17.970
Why?

18:18.330 --> 18:19.620
Well, I don't know.

18:19.650 --> 18:20.650
But...

18:21.770 --> 18:24.010
they just like being babified.

18:24.090 --> 18:27.120
For me, it's the joy of
going back to a simpler time.

18:27.480 --> 18:29.690
A time when one had
no responsibility.

18:29.720 --> 18:34.410
And a few hours of being released from
the stresses and strains of adulthood

18:34.440 --> 18:36.980
it does me the power of good.

18:37.010 --> 18:40.290
It really is quite harmless,
David.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.410
Well, I think it's disgusting!

18:44.890 --> 18:46.220
I want you all to get out!

18:46.250 --> 18:48.880
Out, now!
And you can take that with you!

18:49.010 --> 18:52.770
David, don't throw the babies
out with the bathwater, please!

18:52.960 --> 18:54.250
Mum was right.

18:55.250 --> 18:57.320
She told me you
weren't to be trusted.

18:59.010 --> 19:00.730
You are a whore!

19:07.890 --> 19:10.010
I was sorry to hear
about your mother, David.

19:10.530 --> 19:11.890
I only met her a
couple of times,

19:11.920 --> 19:15.080
but she struck me as being
a most formidable woman.

19:15.330 --> 19:18.970
Wherever she is, I know
she'd be very proud of you.

19:28.290 --> 19:30.120
I am proud, David.

19:30.680 --> 19:32.290
Very proud.

19:35.160 --> 19:39.080
After I calmed down, I realised
I'd made a terrible mistake.

19:40.530 --> 19:43.600
I'd forgotten to record Fred
Dinenage's Murder Casebook.

19:44.400 --> 19:48.690
As well as that, I'd upsetted
Emily and that made me sad.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.170
Please don't go!

19:50.530 --> 19:52.980
It's no good, David,
you can't talk to me like that.

19:53.010 --> 19:54.320
I know. It...

19:54.370 --> 19:55.800
It wasn't me!

19:56.200 --> 19:57.360
Who was it, then?

19:57.680 --> 20:00.260
Did a dog make you do it,
like David Berkowitz?

20:00.290 --> 20:01.450
No, it was...

20:02.440 --> 20:03.840
It was a mistake.

20:04.680 --> 20:05.840
I'm sorry!

20:07.250 --> 20:10.410
I only didn't mention the job
because I was embarrassed.

20:10.440 --> 20:12.690
Well, you don't have
to be embarrassed!

20:12.890 --> 20:14.530
I like babies.

20:16.050 --> 20:17.250
So do I.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.010
I'd like to have a baby.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.360
Shall we make one?

20:25.130 --> 20:26.290
Yeah, all right.

20:31.720 --> 20:34.500
But normal sized, though,
and not with a beard.

20:34.530 --> 20:35.530
All right.

20:35.890 --> 20:37.770
I'll stay and have
a baby with you.

20:38.370 --> 20:39.930
But on one condition.

20:45.770 --> 20:48.170
You've got to get
rid of your mother.

20:57.290 --> 20:58.290
What?!

20:58.400 --> 21:00.450
Oh, yeah, sorry.
I forgot to say.

21:00.720 --> 21:04.290
When my mum died, I kept her
body on ice in the bathtub.

21:04.610 --> 21:09.120
I thought I could bring her back to
life, but they haven't invented it yet.

21:10.370 --> 21:14.770
The ice melted,
and...she went a bit off.

21:16.090 --> 21:17.120
Oh, God.

21:19.650 --> 21:22.410
The next morning we gave
Mum a proper send-off.

21:22.810 --> 21:26.320
We took her to the recycling centre
behind Shopping City in Wood Green.

21:26.810 --> 21:30.600
We split her between garden
waste, general rubbish and metal,

21:30.680 --> 21:32.210
on account of a, erm...

21:40.890 --> 21:44.050
Then Emily and I set about
making a baby together.

21:44.810 --> 21:46.360
It was nice.

21:46.720 --> 21:50.690
And a few months later,
Baby John was born.

21:51.720 --> 21:52.930
I loved him.

21:53.440 --> 21:57.920
I wanted to be a better father
to him than my father was to me.

21:58.330 --> 22:00.690
September 30th 1888.

22:00.720 --> 22:05.730
saw one of Jack's most audacious
acts, known as The Double Event.

22:06.130 --> 22:10.580
On this soggy, miserable night, he
managed to slaughter two victims...

22:10.610 --> 22:13.770
We even threw him a party
to celebrate his birth.

22:14.890 --> 22:18.130
Right, I'm going to introduce
you now to Mr Bunny!

22:18.160 --> 22:20.250
Do you like, erm,
rabbits, little, er...

22:20.850 --> 22:21.890
What's his name?

22:21.920 --> 22:23.010
John.

22:23.050 --> 22:25.210
John? That's imaginative.

22:25.250 --> 22:26.840
You like rabbits, John?

22:27.810 --> 22:29.890
This is really hard for me,
you know, with him being a baby.

22:29.920 --> 22:32.250
Normally, they can reply and
get a bit of banter going.

22:32.570 --> 22:33.540
Anyway, your money.

22:33.570 --> 22:35.980
Er, let's get this rabbit out,
then, shall we?

22:36.010 --> 22:38.860
Come on, that's it,
Mr Bunny, don't be shy.

22:38.890 --> 22:40.730
Oh, fuckin' hell. Stabbed it.

22:40.920 --> 22:43.010
Yep, right in the eye.
Another one gone.

22:43.160 --> 22:45.580
Er, I'm going to need a brick
for that. Finish it off later.

22:45.610 --> 22:47.410
Anyway,
do you like balloon animals?

22:47.440 --> 22:48.580
What's his favourite animal?

22:48.610 --> 22:49.930
- Monkey.
- No, fuck that.

22:49.960 --> 22:52.930
He can have sausage dog,
snake or giraffe.

22:52.960 --> 22:54.650
Snake, please, Mr Jolly.

22:54.680 --> 22:55.680
Jelly!

22:59.720 --> 23:01.770
Turns out we'd
booked the wrong one.

23:02.650 --> 23:06.210
Anyway, Emily got a new job
working at an all-night chemist's.

23:06.250 --> 23:07.170
Like Sam.

23:07.200 --> 23:09.820
He works night shifts. He
should be back soon, actually.

23:09.850 --> 23:11.120
Oh, I didn't mind.

23:11.440 --> 23:13.930
It meant that I had more
time with baby John.

23:14.440 --> 23:16.290
We were so happy together.

23:18.890 --> 23:20.600
Then she came back.

23:32.920 --> 23:35.320
You're going to need more
salt than that, David.

23:36.290 --> 23:39.170
Mum? What are you doing back?
I thought...

23:39.200 --> 23:41.770
Thought you got rid of me?
No, David.

23:41.810 --> 23:43.130
I'm your mother.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.490
Mothers don't leave their sons.

23:45.530 --> 23:48.840
And speaking of
which...who's this?

23:49.810 --> 23:50.840
Baby John.

23:50.890 --> 23:52.490
Baby John!

23:53.010 --> 23:55.010
He reminds me of you, David.

23:55.200 --> 23:58.120
Big, fat,
simple face and a stinky bum.

23:58.400 --> 24:00.840
But...we recycled you.

24:01.480 --> 24:02.450
We laid you to rest.

24:02.480 --> 24:03.880
Not quite.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.210
You couldn't stop yourself,
could you?

24:06.370 --> 24:08.290
You did an Edmund Kemper.

24:08.370 --> 24:09.930
Kept your mother's head...

24:12.200 --> 24:14.410
and bricked it up in the wall.

24:14.960 --> 24:16.080
It was true.

24:23.330 --> 24:26.210
I wanted her close by,
so she could keep an eye on me.

24:33.920 --> 24:35.530
It was a mistake.

24:35.850 --> 24:38.170
You'll never guess who
I met last night, David.

24:38.850 --> 24:40.010
Jack.

24:40.570 --> 24:41.880
The Ripper?

24:42.090 --> 24:44.530
He don't like being called that,
but, yeah.

24:44.920 --> 24:46.410
And he's really nice.

24:46.440 --> 24:48.410
- You know who he is?
- Yeah.

24:49.130 --> 24:52.300
I can't tell you, cos there
are certain protocols, but, ha,

24:52.330 --> 24:53.340
you won't believe it.

24:53.370 --> 24:55.820
- Is it Tumblety?
- Not saying.

24:55.850 --> 24:58.690
- It's not Clarence?!
- I'm not telling you, David!

24:59.530 --> 25:01.320
But there is a way to find out.

25:01.850 --> 25:02.850
What?

25:03.440 --> 25:04.840
Kill yourself.

25:05.130 --> 25:06.130
Cut your wrists now,

25:06.160 --> 25:08.780
and in ten minutes I'll have you
chatting away with Jack the Ripper,

25:08.810 --> 25:10.490
identity known.

25:10.770 --> 25:12.930
- I can't!
- Why not?!

25:13.480 --> 25:15.410
I've got to look
after baby John.

25:15.440 --> 25:18.210
Well, that's easily remedied.
Just kill the baby, David.

25:19.480 --> 25:20.600
No.

25:20.850 --> 25:23.170
You'll do as you're told.
Kill that baby!

25:27.610 --> 25:30.800
- I don't want to.
- David, pick up that baby!

25:34.010 --> 25:37.530
Now bring it over to the stove
and we're going to get it boiled.

25:43.920 --> 25:45.130
I want Emily!

25:45.160 --> 25:47.800
She's not here. I am.

25:53.850 --> 25:55.530
Now drop it in.

25:56.010 --> 25:57.010
Sorry.

25:59.610 --> 26:00.910
David!

26:01.400 --> 26:02.400
David...

26:02.680 --> 26:04.010
what are you doing?!

26:04.160 --> 26:05.320
Give him to me!

26:06.130 --> 26:08.970
It was Mum! She's come back...

26:10.720 --> 26:12.250
She made me do it!

26:13.330 --> 26:16.080
Your mother is dead, David!

26:16.530 --> 26:19.050
Dead! Dead! Dead!

26:21.090 --> 26:23.410
Emily called the police
and told them everything.

26:24.770 --> 26:27.410
About Mum, the bath, the baby.

26:28.650 --> 26:30.450
Nobody would believe me.

26:31.850 --> 26:35.890
I got taken away...and I
haven't seen them since.

26:38.370 --> 26:40.320
But her head's still here,
isn't it?

26:42.160 --> 26:43.930
That's why she's not at rest.

26:45.680 --> 26:47.600
I came as soon as I heard.

26:49.130 --> 26:51.490
I think you could be in danger.

26:52.250 --> 26:54.600
I think you two have
chatted long enough.

26:56.960 --> 26:59.120
It's time to do a bad murder.

27:01.370 --> 27:02.410
No, Mum.

27:03.490 --> 27:04.800
I won't do it.

27:05.810 --> 27:07.360
You can't make me.

27:07.770 --> 27:09.600
I wasn't talking to you.

27:17.530 --> 27:19.010
That's it, David.

27:19.330 --> 27:20.360
It's all right.

27:21.200 --> 27:22.650
We'll be together now.

27:23.810 --> 27:29.800
Forever and ever...and ever...

27:30.090 --> 27:31.270
Babe, are you up?

27:31.470 --> 27:33.730
How did you get on
with Mr Sowerbutts?

27:41.090 --> 27:42.090
Bea?

27:59.610 --> 28:02.560
So, remember, I'm going to
be back a bit late tonight,

28:03.890 --> 28:05.560
but I'll leave the
radio on for you.

28:06.650 --> 28:07.890
Keep you company.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.290
See you later!
