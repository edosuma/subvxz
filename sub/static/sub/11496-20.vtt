00:05.305 --> 00:07.172
Hello, walden.
Good to see you.

00:07.174 --> 00:09.341
I would say, "good to see you,"
but, of course,

00:09.343 --> 00:12.344
When I see you, it's usually
'cause things aren't good.

00:13.513 --> 00:16.849
Well, if things were
always good with people,

00:16.851 --> 00:19.118
I wouldn't have that condo
in palm springs.

00:20.620 --> 00:21.987
So...

00:21.989 --> 00:23.989
What's going on?

00:23.991 --> 00:27.026
Well, I left
the woman that I loved

00:27.028 --> 00:28.327
And thought I was gonna marry

00:28.329 --> 00:31.230
For another woman
who I thought I loved more,

00:31.232 --> 00:33.065
And then...

00:33.067 --> 00:34.733
I lost them both.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.235
So tell me about these women.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.037
Well, kate was my ex,

00:38.039 --> 00:40.239
But the only reason
we broke up in the first place

00:40.241 --> 00:41.673
Is 'cause she moved to china.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.475
Um, she's amazing.

00:43.477 --> 00:44.743
(soft laugh)

00:44.745 --> 00:46.979
She's smart and driven

00:46.981 --> 00:50.315
And sexy and beautiful.

00:50.317 --> 00:52.084
Then there's

00:52.086 --> 00:55.187
Vivian, who's a girl
who knocked on my door

00:55.189 --> 00:57.756
'cause she wanted
to drink from my hose.

00:57.758 --> 01:01.060
Okay, let's table
the hose part for now

01:01.062 --> 01:04.163
And focus on the fact that you
broke up with a woman you loved

01:04.165 --> 01:06.398
For a stranger
who knocked on your door.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.500
I know. Romantic, right?

01:08.502 --> 01:10.936
What the hell's wrong with you?

01:10.938 --> 01:13.205
Isn't that what
I'm paying you to tell me?

01:13.207 --> 01:15.007
Well, if I just
tell you the answers,

01:15.009 --> 01:17.943
I don't get to yell at you. And
this has to be fun for me, too.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.879
Let me ask you
something, walden.

01:20.881 --> 01:23.048
Have you ever
been able to have sex

01:23.050 --> 01:25.050
And not fall in love?

01:25.052 --> 01:27.453
Only with myself.

01:27.455 --> 01:30.589
Well, it seems to me
you base your own value

01:30.591 --> 01:33.125
On who's willing
to have sex with you.

01:33.127 --> 01:36.061
How do you feel
after you sleep with someone?

01:36.063 --> 01:38.130
Grateful.

01:38.132 --> 01:39.264
Happy.

01:39.266 --> 01:42.401
Bashful. Dopey.
Basically all the dwarfs.

01:42.403 --> 01:45.037
Did it ever occur to you
that these women

01:45.039 --> 01:47.206
Might also be grateful?

01:47.208 --> 01:48.540
No.

01:48.542 --> 01:49.908
Well, why not? You're a smart,

01:49.910 --> 01:52.077
Successful, good-looking guy.

01:52.079 --> 01:54.913
There are plenty of women who
would love to have sex with you.

01:54.915 --> 01:57.116
Are you flirting with me?

01:57.118 --> 01:59.751
Walden, now you're
attempting to forge

01:59.753 --> 02:03.288
An emotional attachment
with your gay therapist.

02:03.290 --> 02:05.557
Is it working?

02:05.559 --> 02:08.026
A little bit.
You're extremely pretty.

02:09.162 --> 02:10.929
But the point is,

02:10.931 --> 02:12.931
You need to break this pattern.

02:12.933 --> 02:14.566
How am I supposed to do that?

02:14.568 --> 02:17.102
I'm gonna
write you a prescription.

02:17.104 --> 02:19.738
You need to learn
to enjoy sexual relations

02:19.740 --> 02:21.940
Without concluding
that every woman...

02:21.942 --> 02:23.242
Is the one.

02:25.011 --> 02:29.181
"bang everything that moves."

02:29.183 --> 02:31.850
Twice a day, if possible.
Mixing with alcohol is fine,

02:31.852 --> 02:33.352
Just not while driving.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.786
Look,

02:34.788 --> 02:36.989
If you do this, it's very likely
that the next time

02:36.991 --> 02:40.692
You fall in love, the emotions
that you feel will be authentic

02:40.694 --> 02:43.162
And not just
projecting on someone

02:43.164 --> 02:45.364
Because you shared
a physical connection.

02:45.366 --> 02:47.966
But what if the first woman
I have casual sex with

02:47.968 --> 02:49.168
Turns out to be the one?

02:49.170 --> 02:51.036
Wow.

02:51.038 --> 02:52.638
When I'm done with you,

02:52.640 --> 02:54.873

Uh, how did you hear about
my chiropractic business,

03:12.359 --> 03:15.527
Adjustments...
(whispers): By the sea?

03:15.529 --> 03:17.196
You came into the deli.

03:17.198 --> 03:18.797
You asked to pay
for your baba ghanoush

03:18.799 --> 03:20.566
With free back adjustment.

03:20.568 --> 03:23.068
Mm. That doesn't
narrow it down.

03:23.070 --> 03:25.237
I made that offer in a lotta
delis in little armenia.

03:25.239 --> 03:26.705
Anyway,
why don't you,

03:26.707 --> 03:29.241
Uh, hop up on the table
and I'll try to make your back

03:29.243 --> 03:31.310
As tender as your kebobs.

03:35.815 --> 03:37.082
Oh, my.

03:37.084 --> 03:39.818
Guess this explains
the hair in my hummus.

03:40.820 --> 03:42.688
Whoa.

03:42.690 --> 03:44.323
Those are balls.

03:44.325 --> 03:47.326
Uh, alan, can I talk to you
for a second?

03:47.328 --> 03:49.728
Oh, uh, uh, just,
just make yourself comfortable.

03:56.337 --> 03:58.403
(whispers): By the sea.

04:03.610 --> 04:06.211
What's going on?
Well, I don't know
if you've noticed,

04:06.213 --> 04:08.080
But I haven't really been
working very much lately.

04:08.082 --> 04:09.514
You know, now that
you mention it,

04:09.516 --> 04:12.417
I  <i>have</i>noticed that you've been
here literally every day

04:12.419 --> 04:14.086
For the past three years.

04:14.088 --> 04:16.855

04:19.927 --> 04:21.360
That's great.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.061
And I'm really proud of you.

04:23.063 --> 04:26.265
But why's it happening
(whispers): In my living room?

04:26.267 --> 04:28.900
Because you can charge
$50 more an hour if it's

04:28.902 --> 04:30.235
(whispers): By the sea.

04:30.237 --> 04:31.303

Above a quiznos.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.642
Okay, this is my house,
not a place of business.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.644
It's just temporary.
I-I just need to

04:38.646 --> 04:40.545

I can rent a new space.

This is gonna be a good
thing. You'll see.

Yes, dr. Harper has made

06:20.914 --> 06:23.482
A tremendous success
of his life.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.217
He's gone from having nothing

06:25.219 --> 06:27.052
To living in a house
on the beach.

Well, how long
till you get here?
I don't know.

06:55.115 --> 06:58.250
How long does it take the jaws
of life to pry open a prius?

06:58.252 --> 07:00.452
Just-just keep her busy.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.454
How? I'm not a chiropractor.

07:02.456 --> 07:04.856

licensing board, neither am I.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.260
I'll be there as soon as I can.

You're not?

Oh.

You're talking about...

07:41.327 --> 07:43.261
Thank you. (giggles)

07:43.263 --> 07:44.396
Um... (clears throat)

07:44.398 --> 07:49.301
So, walden, are-are you
a chiropractor, too?

07:49.303 --> 07:50.836
Oh, no. You do not
want these hands

07:50.838 --> 07:52.337
Touching your body.

07:52.339 --> 07:55.407
I don't have the
proper credentials.

07:55.409 --> 07:58.310
I do, however, have
a note from a doctor.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.178
Is that velour?

08:01.147 --> 08:03.215
You are adorable.

08:04.684 --> 08:06.485
So, how'd you hurt your back?

08:06.487 --> 08:10.288
You know, it might just
be easier if I showed you.

08:10.290 --> 08:13.091
Easy's... Always good.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.826
That's true.

08:14.828 --> 08:18.830
Although some things are better
when they're harder.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.099
Oh, yeah, like working out.

08:23.035 --> 08:26.438
Or what you're
talking about.

08:28.641 --> 08:30.709
I see how you
hurt your back.

08:32.545 --> 08:33.879
I hope I didn't hurt yours.

08:33.881 --> 08:36.815
Sorry for the scratch marks.
Yeah.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.817
Listen, um,

08:38.819 --> 08:40.819
I hope you don't take
this the wrong way...

08:40.821 --> 08:44.956
Oh. I think taking it the wrong
way is what fixed my back.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.659
Actually, that was an accident,
but it worked out for everyone.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.127
Anyway, I...

08:49.129 --> 08:52.697
I recognize that
what we just shared

08:52.699 --> 08:56.301
Is something
very intimate,

08:56.303 --> 08:59.137
And it would only be
natural for both of us

08:59.139 --> 09:01.339
To be experiencing feelings

09:01.341 --> 09:03.408
Of affection for one another,

09:03.410 --> 09:05.076
And perhaps develop a desire

09:05.078 --> 09:09.247
To share a meal or a drink

09:09.249 --> 09:11.149
Or a couple of years together,

09:11.151 --> 09:12.918
But is it
possible that

09:12.920 --> 09:15.153
What might be best

09:15.155 --> 09:16.721
Is...

09:16.723 --> 09:18.523
For this to remain a

09:18.525 --> 09:20.825
Casual encounter?

09:20.827 --> 09:22.661
Sure.

09:24.530 --> 09:27.032
Really?
Yep.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.600
'cause I-if you want
to get a cup of coffee...

09:28.602 --> 09:31.636
Oh, I got to go pick up my kids
from soccer. Thanks, walden.

09:32.605 --> 09:34.906
Aw. What a good mom.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.178
Oh, good, mrs. Butler,
I am so sorry I'm late.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.680
Oh, don't worry about it.
It's fine.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.014
Uh, no, no, no, it's not. Uh,

09:43.016 --> 09:45.083
We still have a half an hour.
Any kinks you need worked out?

09:45.085 --> 09:48.086
Oh, trust me, the next time
I'm feel kinky, I'll be back.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.955
Here you go.
Oh.

09:49.957 --> 09:52.457
But I-I didn't...
Oh, don't worry about
it. I got to run.

09:52.459 --> 09:54.092
Okay, well, c-come again.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.827
Oh, I will.

09:58.631 --> 10:00.532
Sadly, it's not
the first time a woman

10:00.534 --> 10:02.200
Has paid me not to touch her.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.274
Morning.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.976
I had sex yesterday.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.712
Congratulations.
When's the wedding?

10:13.714 --> 10:15.780
Oh. (mock laughs) no.

10:15.782 --> 10:16.982
This was different.

10:16.984 --> 10:19.484
If the kind of sex I had
was a suit,

10:19.486 --> 10:21.319
It would be made of linen,
because it was

10:21.321 --> 10:23.521
So casual.

10:25.157 --> 10:26.558
You? Really?

10:26.560 --> 10:27.592
(chuckles)

10:27.594 --> 10:29.427
I know. You believe it?

10:29.429 --> 10:31.496
We started having sex,
and I caught myself

10:31.498 --> 10:33.665
Trying to make love,
and I said, "no,

10:33.667 --> 10:35.800
No, no."

10:35.802 --> 10:38.069
"this is gonna be
meaningless and empty,

10:38.071 --> 10:40.305
"like two wild elk

10:40.307 --> 10:44.509
Rutting
on the siberian tundra."

10:44.511 --> 10:47.245
You know, only male elk rut.

10:56.523 --> 10:58.657

11:00.326 --> 11:03.595
Hello?
Hi. Is this
adjustments by the sea?

11:03.597 --> 11:06.998
Oh, uh, actually,
today it's adjustments by
the closed patio door,

11:07.000 --> 11:09.801
Because a, uh, seagull
pooped on my last client.

11:09.803 --> 11:12.037
Uh... I am dr.
Alan harper.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.605
Uh, do you have
an appointment?

11:13.607 --> 11:15.440
Uh, I do.
But I was hoping

11:15.442 --> 11:18.176
I could see
your associate, walden?

11:18.178 --> 11:21.146
Oh, no, there, uh, there
must be some kind of mistake.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.648
Walden doesn't
actually work with me.

11:23.650 --> 11:27.352
According to my friend tracy,
he worked with her quite well.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.953
Um, tracy?

11:28.955 --> 11:30.622
She was here yesterday.

11:31.624 --> 11:35.560
For the... Internal massage.

11:35.562 --> 11:37.429
Oh! Oh!

11:38.798 --> 11:40.832
Well... Well, I don't...

11:40.834 --> 11:43.034
Know what went on
between the two of them,

11:43.036 --> 11:45.503
But this is not that
type of business.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.839
Okay, I get it.

11:47.841 --> 11:50.508
Maybe this will help.
Oh, no, I'm not
really comfortable,

11:50.510 --> 11:53.211
Uh, letting you stand
out in the cold.
Please come in.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.680
Um...

11:55.682 --> 11:56.981
Thank you.

11:56.983 --> 11:59.250
Now, um, if I want
anything special,

11:59.252 --> 12:01.553
Should I negotiate
with walden directly?

12:01.555 --> 12:03.254
Oh. No.

12:03.256 --> 12:04.723
No.

12:04.725 --> 12:05.857
No, no, no, no.

12:05.859 --> 12:09.160
Uh, uh, uh, walden...

12:09.162 --> 12:10.695
Walden...

12:10.697 --> 12:12.197
Considers himself
an artist.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.199
And as far as
he's concerned,

12:14.201 --> 12:15.767
You're just two strangers

12:15.769 --> 12:17.836
Meeting in a chiropractic
waiting room.

12:17.838 --> 12:20.739
Uh, any mention of money
would just upset him.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.874
I understand.

12:22.876 --> 12:25.844
Yeah. Oh, and, uh,
here's a diagram
of the human body.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.779
If you'd like, you
can mark the areas

12:27.781 --> 12:30.849
That you'd like him to
give special attention to.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.618
Oh. Oh, my.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.954
Uh, "x" marks
the g-spot.

12:38.791 --> 12:41.626
Oh, oh, good, walden,
uh, you're here.

12:41.628 --> 12:43.928
Um, uh, I need your help.

12:43.930 --> 12:47.365
Um, could you keep my client
company until I get back?

12:47.367 --> 12:48.633
Alan,

12:48.635 --> 12:51.202
I'm not here to babysit
your clients.

12:51.204 --> 12:52.203
I can do it.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.772
No. Uh...

12:54.740 --> 12:56.040
No. No.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.408
This is a man's job.

12:57.410 --> 12:58.643
I-I'll be right back.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.948
Hi. I'm sorry.

13:03.950 --> 13:07.118
Uh, dr. Harper had to
take care of something

13:07.120 --> 13:08.219
Really quick.

13:08.221 --> 13:10.421
Is there anything
I can offer you?

13:10.423 --> 13:12.423
Well, that depends.

13:12.425 --> 13:15.326
Can I offer <i>you</i> anything...

13:15.328 --> 13:17.529

13:23.269 --> 13:25.603

13:28.474 --> 13:30.809

13:38.919 --> 13:41.820
That might take a while.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.488
Why?

13:43.490 --> 13:46.457
Is it big?

13:46.459 --> 13:49.828

that it's <i>quite</i> big.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.833
Wait, wait, we're not really
talking about the house, are we?

13:54.835 --> 13:56.801
No, no, we're not.
Oh. (laughs)

13:56.803 --> 13:57.869
Yay!

13:59.438 --> 14:00.905

an excellent idea!

as much noise as you want.

20:27.260 --> 20:31.195
Anything you say can and will
be held against you.

20:31.197 --> 20:32.930
I'd like to hold <i>those</i>
<i>against me.</i>

20:32.932 --> 20:34.065
Oh.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.534
(laughing):
Oh, kinky. Okay.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.102
You're being arrested.

20:38.104 --> 20:42.039
Yes, I am-- by your
captivating gaze.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.441
Oh, wait, I'm-I'm
really being arrested?

20:43.443 --> 20:45.243
Yeah.
Oh, oh, god, no, no,

20:45.245 --> 20:46.444
We-we can work this out.

20:46.446 --> 20:47.945
I-I have money.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.614
Walden, walden, help me.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.182
Walden!
Okay, wait,

20:51.184 --> 20:54.118
J-just to be clear,
we're not having sex, right?

20:54.120 --> 20:58.256
When are you gonna tell him
that was my acting coach?

20:59.258 --> 21:02.593
Probably after
the cavity search.

21:03.895 --> 21:06.964
By the sea!
