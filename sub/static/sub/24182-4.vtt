00:13.263 --> 00:14.723
[Katie] Oh, hey, karaoke tonight.

00:15.682 --> 00:18.226
Not gonna happen after my mom sees this.

00:21.271 --> 00:23.440
[yells] You got a D
on your algebra test?

00:24.149 --> 00:27.152
Louder, Katie. Don't think they heard you
over the cappuccino machine.

00:27.235 --> 00:28.820
You got a D on your algebra test.

00:30.196 --> 00:31.322
[Alexa sighs]

00:32.323 --> 00:34.951
How did this happen? I'm great at math.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.579
This is high school math, OK?
Everyone's struggling.

00:37.662 --> 00:41.082
-What did you get?
-An A, but it was a struggle.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.294
Look, we'll go to karaoke another night.

00:44.377 --> 00:45.545
[sighs] Not in this decade.

00:45.628 --> 00:48.006
When Lucas got a D,
he was grounded forever.

00:48.089 --> 00:49.758
So take a good look at this face.

00:50.216 --> 00:51.885
Who knows when you'll see it again?

00:51.968 --> 00:56.473
Well, I'll see you at school and through
your bedroom window. Oh, we can FaceTime.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.266
I'm making a point, Katie!

00:58.767 --> 01:00.852
Do you want me to remember that face?

01:01.603 --> 01:03.605
How about this face? [grunts]

01:04.856 --> 01:06.191
Yeah. Yeah, that's better.

to ease her into the D.

I'll tell her how pretty she is.

01:43.728 --> 01:46.314
No, too obvious.
I'll ask her how her day was.

Oh, hey, honey. Hi, Katie.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.907
Hi, Mom! How was your day?

01:56.699 --> 01:57.700
Me?

01:58.576 --> 01:59.577
My day?

02:00.662 --> 02:02.872
Oh, well, let's see. Um...

02:03.373 --> 02:06.876
Well, our printer ran out of ink,
so I had to go to the office supply store.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.295
But when I got there,
I forgot what cartridge we use,

02:09.379 --> 02:10.630
so then I called your father.

02:10.713 --> 02:13.967
He was no help because he was landing
the plane and "couldn't be interrupted."

02:14.050 --> 02:15.051
-[Alexa scoffs]
-Wow.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.345
So, uh, I printed the file at the library.

02:17.428 --> 02:19.722
[gasps] The library? No way!

02:19.806 --> 02:21.933
Oh, my gosh! Great twist!

02:23.434 --> 02:25.186
It wasn't that great.

02:25.270 --> 02:27.188
You look so pretty. [chuckles]

02:27.939 --> 02:30.316
-Alexa?
-How was your day yesterday?

02:34.362 --> 02:35.363
OK, what's up?

02:36.656 --> 02:38.950
I got my first math test back today and...

02:40.118 --> 02:41.119
well...

02:42.620 --> 02:43.621
here.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.626
A D?

02:48.710 --> 02:50.211
[sighs] What happened?

02:50.295 --> 02:52.839
Even when you're mad, you look pretty.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.342
Yeah? Well I'm about to get
a whole lot prettier.

02:57.343 --> 02:59.637

02:59.721 --> 03:00.722

What I'm trying to say is...

03:05.852 --> 03:07.061
try harder next time.

03:08.730 --> 03:09.731
So that's it?

03:10.982 --> 03:13.026
Well, can I go to karaoke tonight?

03:14.611 --> 03:15.528
Yeah.

03:16.029 --> 03:16.863
Yeah, sure.

03:17.572 --> 03:18.573
[silently mouths]

03:18.656 --> 03:19.490
Wait.

03:19.908 --> 03:22.368
[sighs] Yeah,
I figured that you would change your--

03:22.452 --> 03:24.245
Just take a nap first.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.873
And wear a sweater,
because it's chilly out.

03:27.624 --> 03:30.501
And do a Beyoncé song. Works every time.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.477

-I know!

-Why was she so cool about it?
-I don't know!

03:51.064 --> 03:54.025
-Hey.
-Oh, hey, Lucas. You were...

03:54.108 --> 03:58.112
[laughs] ...so funny at lunch today!

03:58.196 --> 03:59.739
We didn't have lunch together.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.200
That wasn't me?

04:05.662 --> 04:06.829
Huh. Huh.

04:07.580 --> 04:10.250
Alexa, you look great.
How are you feeling?

04:12.961 --> 04:14.254
You told him?

04:14.337 --> 04:16.047
We were on a long car ride.

04:16.130 --> 04:17.757
We ran out of things to talk about.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.760
You better not tell anyone.

04:20.843 --> 04:22.387
My lips are sealed.

04:23.304 --> 04:24.639
[mumbles] See? Sealed!

04:25.682 --> 04:27.267
Yeah, I like you better that way.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.020
You got a D on your algebra test?

04:31.104 --> 04:33.022
I thought you were smart.

04:33.314 --> 04:36.484
Well, I thought you were funny,
but, hey, life is full of disappointments.

04:37.777 --> 04:40.446
He's really smart, Lex. He's in AP Calc.

04:40.530 --> 04:44.742
Wow. A dweeb who's good at math.
I bet the girls are all over that.

04:44.826 --> 04:48.663
Well, guess what this "dweeb" is doing
Saturday night? It's gonna be epic.

04:48.746 --> 04:50.373
Midnight mathlete meeting?

04:50.456 --> 04:51.666
That's Tuesday.

04:53.042 --> 04:54.794
We're gonna hit the Wellard sign.

04:54.877 --> 04:55.878
No way!

04:55.962 --> 04:58.464
You're going to change the letters
on the town sign?

04:59.215 --> 05:00.883
Wait, can't you get in trouble for that?

05:00.967 --> 05:03.344
Yup. I heard a guy went to jail.

05:03.428 --> 05:06.222
He did six months... hard time.

05:07.473 --> 05:10.393
I heard a guy got struck by lightning.
Now all he can say is...

05:10.476 --> 05:11.978
[mimics electrocution]

05:15.398 --> 05:18.443
Yeah, I heard his garage door opens
every time he walks by.

05:21.237 --> 05:22.530
[chuckles] Oh, hey, Dad.

05:23.114 --> 05:25.199
We're not doing anything.
How was your day?

05:25.742 --> 05:27.035
Do I look like your mother?

05:29.579 --> 05:32.415
Of course I can't know about it,
but are you guys thinking of, uh...

05:32.498 --> 05:34.709
going up to the town sign
and rearranging the letters?

05:34.792 --> 05:35.793
No.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.713
Because when I was in high school,

05:38.796 --> 05:43.634
a couple of kids, that may or may not
have included your dad, changed the sign.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.888
Really, Dad? What did you make it say?

05:47.638 --> 05:48.765
[chuckles]

05:49.974 --> 05:51.726
[laughs]

05:52.518 --> 05:55.063
"Welcome to Wellnerd."

05:55.146 --> 05:56.439
[laughs]

05:57.523 --> 05:59.942
Again, I may or may not
have been involved, so...

06:00.777 --> 06:02.278
this conversation never happened.

06:02.737 --> 06:03.738
But make it count.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.908
Did your dad just make it uncool?

06:07.784 --> 06:10.870
We're still doing it. We staked it out
last night and we put the ladder up.

06:10.953 --> 06:13.081
-Mm. Then you chickened out?
-No!

06:13.164 --> 06:14.540
It was dewy outside.

06:16.959 --> 06:19.545
But we're going tomorrow night
and it's going to be epic!

06:19.629 --> 06:20.838
[chuckles] Totally!

06:24.050 --> 06:25.426
Sick!

06:27.637 --> 06:28.763
Die, zombie! Die!

06:29.388 --> 06:31.182
Fine, die again.

06:31.265 --> 06:33.392
I can do this all day.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.438
Hey, Jack, bad news.

06:37.522 --> 06:40.817
Looking at our calendar, we're not gonna
have time for our camping trip this fall.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.193
I'm so sorry, buddy.

06:42.276 --> 06:43.277
OK.

06:44.487 --> 06:47.115
Gosh, I know. It's disappointing, huh?

06:47.657 --> 06:48.658
What?

06:49.826 --> 06:52.078
-The camping trip.
-Oh, yeah, we're not going.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.667
There's an asteroid headed for Earth.
We're all gonna die.

let you come out tonight,

08:03.566 --> 08:06.944
That's cashmere! Do you know how hard
it is to get coffee out of cashmere?

08:07.028 --> 08:10.364
That's why I leave my cashmere at home,
and my soul.

08:13.993 --> 08:15.536
Jack, I have a surprise.

08:15.953 --> 08:16.954
Cool.

That you have to come outside to see.

since you got it.

Since we can't get to the campground,
I brought the campground to us.

We'll play games, we'll make s'mores.

and I'll teach you bird calls.

to ask me before you borrow my clothes!

if you held your arms like this. Yeah.

10:17.199 --> 10:19.201
I'm gonna go soak it in cold water.

Just ask next time.

10:24.332 --> 10:25.333
Whoa.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.003
Does that seem normal?

10:29.712 --> 10:32.048
I don't know.
My mother doesn't have cashmere.

10:33.132 --> 10:35.926
First she let me slide for the D,
and now this?

10:38.095 --> 10:40.306
Oh, my God! You know what this means?

10:40.389 --> 10:43.851
She's going to buy another one, yeah.
So could I have the old one?

the whole thing in coffee--

10:46.646 --> 10:47.647

would do that to me.
