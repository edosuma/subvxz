So what's the plan?

06:29.107 --> 06:30.441
Oh dude, you know the plan.

Get jobs at my dad's mountain,

07:05.560 --> 07:06.811
No, no, what's up?

07:12.191 --> 07:14.110
We made those plans when
we were like 12 dude.

07:14.944 --> 07:16.362
Yeah, I mean,

07:16.612 --> 07:17.739
we did it on a pinky promise.

07:18.614 --> 07:19.657
Yeah, but,

07:20.324 --> 07:22.285
there's other things I got
to consider now, too.

07:22.952 --> 07:24.495
Like, what?

07:25.204 --> 07:26.205

medical school...

07:27.790 --> 07:30.293
[mumbles] She wants to be a vet.

07:30.585 --> 07:32.628

- Yeah, but she also wants to get out of here.

07:33.337 --> 07:34.881
So what, she can't move with us?

07:35.506 --> 07:36.841
Come on man,
you know what I mean.

07:38.009 --> 07:39.010
[John] Yeah.

07:40.219 --> 07:43.848
I mean, yeah, I mean just wait
like a year, and then...

07:44.682 --> 07:47.101
- We'll save up money...
- John.

07:50.772 --> 07:52.023
You made a pinky promise.

07:52.607 --> 07:54.233
Yeah I know, but things
change dude.

07:55.401 --> 07:57.320
So you're just going to let
Ann run your life?

07:57.445 --> 07:59.280
- [Michael] No dude, it's not like that.
- No...

07:59.364 --> 08:01.574
Yeah I mean, you know,
you're banging this chick and,

08:01.741 --> 08:03.326
- you're just moving into her...
- [Michael] Hey.

08:07.538 --> 08:08.998
What are you even going to do?

08:10.208 --> 08:11.501
I don't know, I was gonna,

08:12.210 --> 08:14.670
see where she, go,
or gets into.

08:14.754 --> 08:16.339
Yeah exactly, you don't know.

08:16.547 --> 08:18.716
I'll tell you what you're gonna
do, you're just gonna sit around,

08:19.717 --> 08:21.010
Have you thought about that?

08:22.345 --> 08:23.680
NO you haven't.

08:23.846 --> 08:25.056
Cause I know you.

08:26.599 --> 08:28.017
Come on, I mean fuck that.

08:29.227 --> 08:30.228
You need to,

08:30.478 --> 08:32.020
be a man, you know.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.148
Blaze you're own,

08:34.607 --> 08:35.692
journeys.

08:40.822 --> 08:43.491
[chuckles] I don't know, it
sounded better in my head.

08:45.535 --> 08:46.744
All I'm saying is,

08:47.662 --> 08:49.038
you're Michael.

08:51.290 --> 08:53.751
Just don't let anyone tell you
how or what to think.

08:57.088 --> 08:58.256
Yeah.

09:00.466 --> 09:01.718
Maybe you're right.

09:04.387 --> 09:06.848
It's like worse than getting up
and leaving me, anyway, right?

09:08.141 --> 09:09.350
Exactly.

09:10.393 --> 09:11.477
Besides, she'll,

09:11.686 --> 09:12.770
understand.

09:12.979 --> 09:14.272
- Think so?
- No.

09:14.355 --> 09:16.816
[chuckles] But she'll
get over it.

09:17.275 --> 09:18.651
I hope so.

09:21.279 --> 09:22.947
Do you think we can
smoke in here?

09:23.573 --> 09:24.907
Yeah, the windows...

09:27.452 --> 09:29.829

09:46.387 --> 09:47.680

09:47.764 --> 09:50.141
Big Bertha's jammed up again,
go down there and fix it.

09:50.308 --> 09:52.727

- [man] They're busy.

10:03.529 --> 10:04.614
[John] Hey.

10:05.365 --> 10:06.366

Need any help?

10:13.581 --> 10:14.874
What are you doing

10:15.083 --> 10:17.877
You wanted lunch,

10:18.252 --> 10:19.253
There you go.

10:19.629 --> 10:20.755

10:21.464 --> 10:22.882
We got the day off tomorrow.

10:23.216 --> 10:24.550
Huh, any ideas?

10:25.343 --> 10:26.803
Honestly man, just,

10:30.807 --> 10:33.726
[chuckles] Oh dude,

10:51.494 --> 10:52.829
You wanna go to a bar tonight?

10:52.995 --> 10:54.247
We could watch the game.

10:54.997 --> 10:56.165
I'm good dude.

10:56.499 --> 10:59.168
Gonna go home, take a shower,

You do that every night,
I mean,

11:04.590 --> 11:05.717

11:07.427 --> 11:08.594

11:09.971 --> 11:11.055
Nothing.

11:12.640 --> 11:14.434
I thought you said
you were over it?

11:17.061 --> 11:18.813
It's not that dude, it's this.

11:19.188 --> 11:20.273
I mean look at me.

11:21.607 --> 11:23.943
Come on, we knew what we were
getting into, when we took the job.

11:24.193 --> 11:25.319
Oh, did we?

11:26.029 --> 11:28.573
I sure didn't see myself having
to unclog a giant saw.

11:29.032 --> 11:31.576
Ok so, we didn't know what
we were getting into.

11:31.951 --> 11:32.994
But um,

11:33.619 --> 11:35.830
I mean, you know,
it could be worse.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.582
And uh,

11:37.957 --> 11:39.876

Screw the bar.

11:54.640 --> 11:56.100

11:56.392 --> 11:59.562

I'm just gonna call it after my shift, alright?

11:59.896 --> 12:00.897
Fuck your shift.

12:02.690 --> 12:03.858

12:04.400 --> 12:06.944
And then, I'll let you sleep

12:09.530 --> 12:10.573

12:15.912 --> 12:17.163
One game.

12:18.039 --> 12:19.207
One game.

12:29.509 --> 12:30.802
Cock!

12:31.636 --> 12:33.763
[Christian] You want to shoot

12:34.263 --> 12:36.683
- Best two out of three.
- Fat fucking chance, John boy.

12:40.395 --> 12:42.063

12:46.317 --> 12:47.819
Hey man, keep it down.

12:47.944 --> 12:48.945
Parents are upstairs.

12:49.070 --> 12:50.405

12:50.822 --> 12:52.031
Not in this house.

12:52.907 --> 12:55.034

12:58.037 --> 12:59.622

13:00.081 --> 13:02.041

13:02.917 --> 13:04.335
Just another boring
day at the mill.

13:05.086 --> 13:06.254
What happened this time?

13:07.004 --> 13:09.340
I just unclogged a giant
saw gear.

13:09.674 --> 13:11.300
Honestly man,
I should have been a plumber.

13:11.759 --> 13:13.928
I don't know man,
unclogging a giant saw,

13:14.053 --> 13:15.304
actually sounds kinda cool.

13:15.388 --> 13:17.348
[Michael] Yeah first couple of
times, but now it's kind of,

13:17.473 --> 13:18.683
lost it's luster.

13:22.812 --> 13:25.481
- Hello boys.
- [all] Hello Mrs. Bogart.

13:25.565 --> 13:26.524
Hey mom.

13:26.607 --> 13:28.609
Christian, I need you to
take the trash out in a bit.

13:28.693 --> 13:29.736
Ok.

13:30.153 --> 13:33.322
Oh, and you're aunt Gladius is coming
to stay with us for a few days.

13:33.614 --> 13:34.824
She'll be staying in your room.

13:35.074 --> 13:36.075
Sounds great.

13:40.329 --> 13:42.040
[chuckling]

13:42.248 --> 13:45.418
It's been 24-years since you have
moved out of her, do you know that?

13:45.918 --> 13:47.336
Dude, shut the fuck up.

13:47.545 --> 13:48.880
This is bullshit.

13:49.088 --> 13:51.049
- We shouldn't have to drink in fear.
- It's not that bad.

13:51.132 --> 13:52.300
Not that bad?

13:52.550 --> 13:54.218
Prison has less surprise visits.

13:54.635 --> 13:56.804
Besides, she glares at me,
like I'm the black sheep.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.223
She's not your biggest fan.

14:00.183 --> 14:01.768
Well, screw this.

14:01.934 --> 14:02.977
Let's go somewhere.

14:03.144 --> 14:04.228
Like where?

14:05.521 --> 14:07.148
Back on America soil.

14:07.774 --> 14:09.609
- [fence rattling]
- [chuckling]

14:11.861 --> 14:15.406
[John] God this brings you back to the time
Corina's house got rolled by the cops.

14:15.531 --> 14:17.492
Everyone jumped into
windows and doors.

14:18.826 --> 14:20.995
[Levi] I've never seen
Christian run so fast.

14:21.079 --> 14:22.330
Yeah, well.

14:22.789 --> 14:24.499
Try having parents like mine.

14:25.375 --> 14:26.959
At least we're legal
to drink now.

14:28.336 --> 14:29.379
[bottle rattles]

14:30.046 --> 14:32.298
- Not in the street.
- Screw it.

14:34.592 --> 14:35.885
You guys uh...

14:37.929 --> 14:39.472
Wanna go back to,
my place?

14:39.555 --> 14:41.599
God, would you live a little.

14:41.724 --> 14:43.017
What are we doing
tomorrow night?

14:43.810 --> 14:45.395
I don't know, drink?

14:45.937 --> 14:47.522
We've been doing that
since graduation.

14:48.189 --> 14:49.357
What's wrong with that?

14:49.982 --> 14:51.150
I don't know.

14:51.901 --> 14:53.736
Let's do something else,
something different.

14:54.278 --> 14:55.863
[John] Hate to break it
to you Michael,

14:56.197 --> 14:57.907
not much different
to do in this town.

15:06.499 --> 15:07.625
Michael!

15:08.084 --> 15:09.085
What?

15:09.252 --> 15:11.754
You got to go down and clear
out big Bertha again.

15:12.088 --> 15:14.340
Come on man, I just fucking
did it yesterday.

15:14.674 --> 15:16.050
Get Cameron or Brock
to do it.

15:16.759 --> 15:17.760
What?

15:19.387 --> 15:20.638
I said no.

15:22.890 --> 15:24.976
Did it sound like I was
asking you?

15:25.435 --> 15:27.395
Well I'm telling you that
I'm done with this shit.

15:27.937 --> 15:29.147
Hey man.

15:30.356 --> 15:32.608
Look he just did it yesterday,
let me do it.

15:33.067 --> 15:34.152
Shut up, John.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.695
Hey fuck you.

15:36.821 --> 15:38.072
Say that again.

15:38.364 --> 15:40.700
He said fuck you, we're done.

15:50.460 --> 15:52.253
Well that got out of hand.

15:54.130 --> 15:55.131
Screw it.

15:55.256 --> 15:57.633
I got tired of that old man
giving me orders anyway.

15:58.092 --> 15:59.344
Won't your dad be pissed?

16:00.511 --> 16:02.013
Oh yeah...

16:03.848 --> 16:05.433
- Going home.
- Hey fuck that.

16:06.059 --> 16:07.643
We just lost our jobs.

16:08.353 --> 16:09.645
We're getting drunk.

16:10.521 --> 16:13.399
Ah, yep, yep, yep, ok good.

16:21.115 --> 16:23.743
[John] So, any plans
for employment?

16:24.702 --> 16:26.662
Anything that doesn't involve
wood working.

16:27.121 --> 16:28.706
There's always the steel mill.

16:29.082 --> 16:30.458
I'd rather hang myself.

16:31.292 --> 16:32.627
Well you're no fun.

16:46.683 --> 16:48.059
[pins fall over]

16:54.649 --> 16:55.733
Alright.

16:56.109 --> 16:57.276
Let's get out of here.

16:57.402 --> 16:58.611
We just got here.

16:58.778 --> 17:00.446
Really 45-minutes ago.

17:01.239 --> 17:02.407
What's up fags?

17:03.157 --> 17:04.701
Hey guys, we were actually
just about to...

17:04.784 --> 17:06.285
First pitchers on me.

17:08.496 --> 17:10.205
[John] Christian,
let me borrow 20 bucks.

17:13.501 --> 17:17.296
[Levi] You know, I thought working for my
sisters lingerie store, would kind of work out.

17:17.505 --> 17:20.967
Figured go in, see enough boobs,
bush, make my way up to manager.

17:21.384 --> 17:23.136
Her and I can run
the family business.

17:24.262 --> 17:25.512
Then she got pregnant.

17:25.887 --> 17:27.223
Gave the job to her husband.

17:27.973 --> 17:31.019
But, you still see boobs
and bush right?

17:31.769 --> 17:33.104
It's not the same.

17:35.523 --> 17:38.192
Remember what we thought life
would be like after graduation?

17:39.318 --> 17:41.029
God, were we that dumb?

17:41.612 --> 17:43.614
Thought for sure
I'd have a house,

17:44.073 --> 17:45.241
and a career by now.

17:45.825 --> 17:48.036
Probably didn't help that
you got a theatre degree.

17:49.662 --> 17:51.372
I mean, what the fuck
happened to us guys?

17:52.331 --> 17:54.917
That's life man,
sometimes it's a bitch.

17:56.002 --> 17:58.880
I don't know about you guys, but if I wasn't
drinking every night, I don't know what I'd do.

17:58.963 --> 18:00.214
What?

18:00.506 --> 18:03.843
You know what I mean, man, it's like we do the
same thing night after night, after night.

18:04.677 --> 18:06.346
It's been three years
and nothing's changed.

18:07.055 --> 18:08.097
So what are you saying?

18:09.098 --> 18:11.601
You wanna go,
like on a road trip?

18:11.684 --> 18:14.020
- Yeah, why not?
- [John] With what money?

18:14.354 --> 18:18.524
We would only get past Vegas, that's if we
don't blow our money on strippers and cocaine.

18:18.983 --> 18:20.735
I'd actually be cool with Vegas.

18:21.402 --> 18:23.529
What about going to valley
stadium and catching a game?

18:23.696 --> 18:25.990
Again, money, which is what
we barely have.

18:26.532 --> 18:28.910
Is there anything we can do, that's
fun, that doesn't involve money?

18:29.202 --> 18:30.203
We could go shooting.

18:30.286 --> 18:32.705
- We do that all the time.
- Ah, not drunk, we haven't.

18:32.955 --> 18:34.123
County fair.

18:34.582 --> 18:38.044
There's always babes, it's always a
good time, it's not for a while, but...

18:39.045 --> 18:40.630
Doing this to October?

18:42.757 --> 18:43.758
How about a hike?

18:47.261 --> 18:48.346
[chuckles]

18:48.805 --> 18:50.640
There is always
robbing banks.

18:50.973 --> 18:52.225
[chuckles]

18:55.770 --> 18:57.689
Yeah, yeah why not?

18:58.231 --> 19:00.608
What? Actually rob a bank?

19:00.942 --> 19:02.485
- Yeah.
- Right.

19:02.777 --> 19:05.321
Could you imagine the four of
us, going in to rob a bank?

19:05.738 --> 19:08.491
- I don't even think we could make it past the front door.
- Why's that?

19:09.492 --> 19:10.827
We're not bank robbers.

19:10.910 --> 19:11.911
Yeah.

19:12.412 --> 19:15.123
[Michael] Well, it's not
that hard, y-you get in,

19:15.456 --> 19:16.791
get some cash,

19:17.166 --> 19:18.292
and you get out, right?

19:18.751 --> 19:20.628
[Levi] Have to be way more
complicated than that.

19:20.712 --> 19:21.629
[Christian] I mean.

19:21.713 --> 19:24.632
We need the getaway cars,
disguises, guns.

19:24.716 --> 19:26.092
Which we all have.

19:27.010 --> 19:28.511
I mean, it's not that
complicated.

19:29.137 --> 19:31.431
I don't know man, I think you've
been watching too many movies.

19:31.514 --> 19:32.557
Well, here me out though.

19:33.975 --> 19:35.727
We hit only local banks, right?

19:36.102 --> 19:37.353
There's not much security.

19:37.812 --> 19:39.522
Barely anyone goes into them.

19:40.356 --> 19:42.358
We get in, get as much
cash as we can,

19:42.650 --> 19:43.985
and we're out in a few seconds.

19:44.777 --> 19:46.904
Michael, [clears throat]
I was kidding.

19:47.155 --> 19:48.698
Yeah well I'm not man.

19:49.198 --> 19:50.366
Fucking look at us.

19:50.867 --> 19:52.285
Why don't we live
a little bit?

19:52.827 --> 19:54.412
Michael, it was a joke.

19:56.205 --> 19:57.248
John.

19:57.665 --> 19:58.833
Tell him.

20:01.794 --> 20:03.046
You're serious?

20:03.921 --> 20:05.173
You want to rob a bank?

20:06.883 --> 20:07.967
Yeah.

20:10.428 --> 20:11.554
I'm in.

20:11.846 --> 20:13.514
- What?
- You're both hammered.

20:14.015 --> 20:15.058
Yeah I am.

20:15.350 --> 20:18.436
You guys realize, if you get caught,
you're gonna do some serious butt time.

20:18.811 --> 20:20.021
Then we won't get caught.

20:20.355 --> 20:21.814
Michael, think about
what you're saying.

20:21.981 --> 20:24.025
Look, we rob easy banks,

20:24.150 --> 20:25.360
we get a shit ton of cash,

20:25.443 --> 20:26.819
and then we spend it
on fun stuff.

20:27.111 --> 20:28.863
Sounds like a good plan to me.

20:29.280 --> 20:30.531
What do you think?
You guys in?

20:31.866 --> 20:34.660
I think it sounds like a kind
of, kind of bad idea.

20:34.869 --> 20:36.037
You wanna go back to,

20:36.162 --> 20:38.206
working at a lingerie store,
for the rest of your life?

20:38.623 --> 20:39.999
Or living in your
parents basement?

20:43.086 --> 20:44.420
And look if we get caught,

20:44.670 --> 20:45.671
we all go down together.

20:49.384 --> 20:52.053
Holy shit, you two are serious.

20:53.846 --> 20:56.349
Yeah I'm in, I'm with ya,
let's do it.

20:56.849 --> 20:57.892
I don't know guys.

20:57.975 --> 21:00.269
[Michael] Christian, come on man,
have I ever steered you wrong?

21:01.729 --> 21:02.730
No.

21:02.814 --> 21:04.482
Well then trust me on this, man.

21:05.191 --> 21:07.819
I wouldn't ask you guys to do this,
if I thought we couldn't pull it off.

21:09.987 --> 21:11.447
- Alright.
- [claps]

21:11.614 --> 21:12.865
- Yeah.
- Alright.

21:13.074 --> 21:14.075
Listen,

21:14.158 --> 21:17.036
we have to promise each other that
we won't tell anybody about this.

21:18.204 --> 21:19.288
We're in till the end.

21:24.627 --> 21:25.712
Really?

21:26.129 --> 21:27.130
What?

21:27.588 --> 21:29.090
No, no, you know what?
He's right.

21:29.382 --> 21:30.758
Come on, hands in.

21:30.883 --> 21:31.968
[sighs]

21:40.143 --> 21:42.186
[Michael] We start from taking
notes from heist movies.

21:42.311 --> 21:43.521
[Levi] Really?

21:43.730 --> 21:46.524
[Christian] Well, not too different
from real life, I guess.

21:48.192 --> 21:50.403
[Michael] We're gonna hit the
general bank, downtown.

21:52.113 --> 21:54.157
John and I are going to be
handling surveillance.

21:56.409 --> 21:58.453
[Christian] Ok so,
what about weapons?

21:58.745 --> 22:01.039
Oh I got my dad's three arm,
I wanna use that.

22:01.122 --> 22:02.582
- A golf club?
- No, you're not using that.

22:02.665 --> 22:03.666
No.

22:03.875 --> 22:05.376
What you got something better?

22:05.460 --> 22:06.961
Than a golf club? Yeah.

22:07.128 --> 22:09.338
- Like what?
- My old man's, Winchester.

22:09.505 --> 22:10.715
Wait what?

22:11.674 --> 22:13.134
[chuckles] The replica?

22:13.217 --> 22:15.887
- You're gonna use a replica to rob a bank?
- Beats a gold club!

22:15.970 --> 22:17.513
No it doesn't,
it doesn't fire.

22:17.638 --> 22:20.183
- People aren't going to think that.
- Yeah, but they're gonna want,

22:20.308 --> 22:22.018
Billy the kid, rob them.

22:23.519 --> 22:25.938
[Michael] Alright, there's a
thrift store, out of town.

22:26.022 --> 22:27.231
[John] What for?

22:27.440 --> 22:30.485
- [Michael] Disguises dude.
- [John] Oh, I'm good.

22:30.943 --> 22:32.445
Oh yeah, what are you
going to wear then?

22:32.695 --> 22:33.863
What for it.

22:34.155 --> 22:35.948
Boom!

22:36.366 --> 22:38.201
[fake panting]

22:40.328 --> 22:41.871
- You're serious?
- Yeah.

22:41.954 --> 22:43.289
Your football jersey?

22:43.373 --> 22:44.290
Yes.

22:44.374 --> 22:46.417
It's cool, it's different.

22:47.001 --> 22:49.087
[Levi] Dude, you're so dumb.

22:49.295 --> 22:51.339
Like, your name is on the back.

22:52.423 --> 22:55.718
[scoffs] Do you know how many
Petersons are around the world, bruh?

22:56.094 --> 22:58.513
Yeah, but how many went to the same
high school as the towns bank.

22:58.596 --> 23:00.348
[Levi] Yeah, uh, exactly.

23:00.431 --> 23:01.891
It's not gonna work.

23:02.058 --> 23:03.226
Fuck.

23:03.518 --> 23:06.688
[Michael] Now I know a guy who
can fix up cars, real cheap.

23:06.896 --> 23:08.106
Oh!

23:08.272 --> 23:12.276
Dude, we got to get the
most badass car there is.

23:12.360 --> 23:14.278
[Michael] How about just a
Buick, or something real simple.

23:14.362 --> 23:15.655
[John] I was, I was gonna
say that.

23:15.738 --> 23:17.824
- [John] Buick.
- [Michael] But we would call it Apricot...

23:17.907 --> 23:18.908
[John] Apricot?

23:18.991 --> 23:20.410
[Michael] Ape Ricot,
not apricot.

23:20.535 --> 23:21.953
[John] Is it apricot?

23:22.745 --> 23:24.414
Change of plans, Christian,

23:24.539 --> 23:25.665
we're using your parents van.

23:25.748 --> 23:27.417
[chuckles] Oh yeah.

23:27.917 --> 23:29.210
Why not Johns truck?

23:29.794 --> 23:31.546
Um, mine can only seat two,

23:31.671 --> 23:33.172
and it's really dirty.

23:34.507 --> 23:37.343
This is my parents van,
it's under my dad's name.

23:37.468 --> 23:39.762
[Levi] Change the plates,
it'll only take a second.

23:40.513 --> 23:41.931
Well what if they need it?

23:42.098 --> 23:44.892
Well then we'll change the
plates back when they want it.

23:46.436 --> 23:47.645
Listen guys,

23:48.229 --> 23:49.397
this is getting out of hand.

23:49.480 --> 23:51.107
Christian, trust me on this.

23:51.315 --> 23:53.568
It's all going to be find and our
parent's won't know a thing.

23:56.070 --> 23:57.739
Great, thank you, alright.

23:58.156 --> 24:00.324
So where are we gonna
stash the cash?

24:00.450 --> 24:01.451
Christian's basement.

24:03.786 --> 24:07.331
How about some place Mrs. Hitler
won't be making surprise visits?

24:07.999 --> 24:09.125
He's got a point.

24:09.375 --> 24:10.752
[Levi] We could stash
it at your place.

24:11.002 --> 24:13.212
No, I don't have
a lock on my door.

24:15.631 --> 24:17.008
I know a place.

24:21.929 --> 24:23.139
Your RV?

24:23.765 --> 24:26.893
- [John] Why not?
- I'd rather have dirty money in a cleaner place.

24:27.560 --> 24:29.354
Trust me.

24:32.690 --> 24:33.816
[Levi] Nice.

24:34.567 --> 24:35.568
Nice.

24:37.153 --> 24:38.154
[chuckles]

24:38.279 --> 24:39.822
Definitely not thrilling,
but nice.

24:39.947 --> 24:43.284
[John] Well she's built for
safety, not for looks.

24:43.534 --> 24:44.660
This could work.

24:45.203 --> 24:46.245
Yeah.

24:46.871 --> 24:48.915
Few hours of cleaning,
this is perfect.

24:49.290 --> 24:50.708
Yeah, great thinking dude.

24:51.959 --> 24:53.378
[Michael] We can't have
it here though.

24:54.003 --> 24:55.213
Where are we gonna put it?

24:56.464 --> 24:58.883
I got an idea, hey John
can you drive?

24:59.008 --> 25:00.051
Yeah,

25:07.266 --> 25:10.061
Oh, too hot, back inside.

25:10.144 --> 25:11.312
[Michael] Oh man up.

25:11.521 --> 25:13.231
There aren't any snakes
out here, are there?

25:13.773 --> 25:15.400
- Probably.
- Dammit.

25:15.650 --> 25:16.818
You know I hate snakes.

25:16.901 --> 25:18.986
Why'd you bring us out to
where the snakes are?

25:19.821 --> 25:21.322
Think about it, it's isolated.

25:21.572 --> 25:23.491
No-one ever comes out this
far from town, anyway.

25:24.117 --> 25:26.327
This is like the start
of every horror movie.

25:26.411 --> 25:27.537
[John] He's right.

25:27.620 --> 25:30.832
And we don't have a black guy,
so the gingers dying first.

25:30.957 --> 25:33.167
[Levi chuckles] More like
the dumb jock.

25:33.584 --> 25:35.795
Oh shit, he's right.

25:37.964 --> 25:39.674
Well at least we've got
our clubhouse.

25:40.508 --> 25:41.843
Hey when'd the big day?

25:42.802 --> 25:44.554
- Did you swap the plates?
- [Levi] Yeah.

25:45.138 --> 25:47.223
- Parents using the other car?
- [Christian] Yeah.

25:48.599 --> 25:49.851
Tomorrow then.

25:51.144 --> 25:52.812
Tomorrow it is.

25:54.147 --> 25:55.815
Tomorrow!

26:11.039 --> 26:12.123
You boys ready?

26:14.125 --> 26:15.126
Yeah.

26:24.218 --> 26:26.346
Hey, it's be alright, just,

26:26.971 --> 26:28.514
two minutes, in and out,
alright?

26:30.641 --> 26:31.934
You guys remember
the code names?

26:36.606 --> 26:37.940
Let's go.

26:42.320 --> 26:43.946
[Michael] Everyone on the floor!

26:46.908 --> 26:48.326
Down!

26:50.370 --> 26:51.871
- [gunshot]
- Mister!

26:53.956 --> 26:55.333
[Michael] What the hell
was that?

26:59.629 --> 27:01.756
Alright screw it,
everyone stand up.

27:02.507 --> 27:03.674
Sammy, get them against
the wall.

27:03.758 --> 27:05.343
[Levi] Let's go, corner now.

27:05.885 --> 27:08.054
Thanks to Deano here, we've got
to make this a little bit faster.

27:09.180 --> 27:10.723
All the cash in the volt.

27:11.933 --> 27:13.309
Make sure to follow her Deano.

27:33.913 --> 27:35.081
[trembling] Shit.

27:36.457 --> 27:37.500
Move it!

27:37.583 --> 27:38.876
I'm trying.

27:39.335 --> 27:40.795
Try harder.

27:41.421 --> 27:42.547
How's it going back there,
Dean?

27:42.630 --> 27:44.424
Give me a few seconds, Frankie.

27:44.716 --> 27:45.717
Sam time?

27:47.301 --> 27:49.554
- Sam time!
- Oh shit.

27:50.054 --> 27:51.139
Come on dude!

27:51.431 --> 27:53.266
Uh, two minutes.

27:54.017 --> 27:55.852
- What?
- Yeah.

27:56.686 --> 27:58.021
Dean we got to move it.

27:58.104 --> 28:01.733
- [yells] Move it!
- [whimpering] I'm sorry,

28:01.816 --> 28:03.026
it's my first day.

28:03.109 --> 28:04.402
Move it, let's go!

28:07.030 --> 28:08.239
Move!

28:10.950 --> 28:12.243
[lock opens]

28:13.703 --> 28:14.871
Put the money in the bag!

28:20.585 --> 28:21.586
More!

28:21.669 --> 28:24.130
We don't have time for more Dean, we
got to go, cops are on their way!

28:24.213 --> 28:25.840
We have plenty of time!

28:26.007 --> 28:27.216
Cops are coming now dude!

28:27.300 --> 28:29.302
Told you there on their way
Dean, we got to move it!

28:33.598 --> 28:35.016
Let's go, let's go!

28:40.855 --> 28:41.939
[Michael] Drive!

28:43.316 --> 28:44.359
[pop]

28:45.610 --> 28:46.986
[screaming]

28:50.490 --> 28:52.200
- [continues screaming]
- [Michael] Levi help!

28:54.202 --> 28:55.495
No stop, you're just
smearing it!

28:55.578 --> 28:56.871
[Levi] What do you
want from me!

28:58.122 --> 28:59.665
Pull out dammit,
will you pull out!

29:01.000 --> 29:03.002
Turn right, turn right!

29:07.006 --> 29:08.674
Christian, did we lose them?

29:09.217 --> 29:10.551
I think we lose them!

29:14.430 --> 29:15.598
Oh shit!

29:15.848 --> 29:17.350
Break, hit the break!

29:17.517 --> 29:19.811
- John the breaks! John!
- Hit the breaks!

29:19.894 --> 29:21.562
- John!
- Alright!

29:22.355 --> 29:23.606
[tries squeal]

29:28.569 --> 29:29.779
John get out, move us in.

29:30.446 --> 29:32.865
[John[ Ow careful, oh, ow.

29:33.449 --> 29:34.617
Get in.

29:35.159 --> 29:36.369
[tires squeal]

29:41.582 --> 29:43.126
Take that alley!

29:57.473 --> 29:58.599
[sirens in distance]

30:01.227 --> 30:02.770
[sirens]

30:04.981 --> 30:06.024
[Michael] They're gone.

30:07.150 --> 30:08.151
What?

30:09.444 --> 30:10.903
It worked. [chuckles]

30:12.196 --> 30:13.698
[chuckles]

30:13.990 --> 30:16.284
- [all cheering]
- [John] Love you man!

30:16.367 --> 30:18.161
[cheering]

30:32.550 --> 30:33.968
[both chuckle]

30:34.469 --> 30:36.262
Ha, ha, ha, very funny guys.

30:36.346 --> 30:38.765
You look like a discounted
Gizz member.

30:40.308 --> 30:42.560
John, why are you so down?

30:43.353 --> 30:44.354
- Get it?
- Yeah.

30:44.437 --> 30:46.272
- Cause your face is...
- Blue, yeah my face is blue.

30:46.356 --> 30:48.983
- Is blue.
- That's real good, you should be a comedian.

30:49.150 --> 30:51.361
- So how much we make off with?
- Seven grand.

30:51.486 --> 30:54.155
Ah that's not too bad, that's
what, seventeen hundred a piece?

30:54.364 --> 30:57.325
Yeah, well it would have been seven
grand, but thanks to that ink bomb,

30:57.408 --> 30:59.285
it's more like forty-five
hundred.

30:59.577 --> 31:00.787
That's still not bad.

31:01.537 --> 31:03.664
It would have been more John,
if you didn't fire that shot.

31:03.915 --> 31:05.083
Like I said,

31:05.375 --> 31:07.418
I carried away,
in the heat of the moment.

31:07.502 --> 31:09.045
Yeah well next time,
don't let it happen.

31:10.088 --> 31:11.255
Next time?

31:12.173 --> 31:13.424
Well yeah, what's you think?

31:13.591 --> 31:16.386
- I thought this was a one time thing, that's it.
- You kidding me?

31:16.469 --> 31:19.847
Yeah I mean besides John's premature
shot, things went off without a hitch.

31:19.972 --> 31:22.225
Yeah which means,
more money, bigger shares.

31:22.308 --> 31:24.435
You had me at premature shot.

31:24.811 --> 31:25.978
[chuckles]

31:27.397 --> 31:28.606
[Christian] You guys are crazy.

31:29.065 --> 31:30.358
What's your problem dude?

31:30.692 --> 31:32.694
My problem is, we almost got
caught from the cops,

31:32.777 --> 31:34.362
because you went crazy
and started shooting,

31:34.445 --> 31:36.280
[John] Ok, I fired one shot.

31:36.698 --> 31:37.865
And I said I was sorry.

31:38.032 --> 31:40.326
- [Christian] We almost went to jail.
- But Christian, we didn't.

31:40.952 --> 31:42.787
In fact we did better than
most bank robbers do.

31:43.121 --> 31:44.580
Guys we got lucky.

31:44.997 --> 31:46.457
We might not be next time.

31:46.749 --> 31:48.960
We will, if we do exactly
what we did this time.

31:50.378 --> 31:52.463
You know what?
I can't do this.

31:52.755 --> 31:55.133
You know, it was fun,
I appreciate the money, but,

31:55.258 --> 31:56.384
I'm not going to jail.

31:56.551 --> 31:59.178
Today was fun, money's nice,
but I ain't, I'm leaving.

31:59.262 --> 32:01.139
- Where are you doing?
- [Christian] Going home.

32:01.556 --> 32:03.558
Hopefully my parents
haven't the news yet.

32:03.725 --> 32:05.685
You can't leave, we need
the van for the getaway!

32:05.768 --> 32:07.562
- [Christian] Fuck you Levi.
- Dick.

32:07.770 --> 32:08.980
What a downer.

32:10.023 --> 32:11.232
Well what now?

32:13.484 --> 32:15.737
We talk to him,
I'll think of something.

32:32.795 --> 32:34.088
You know you can't back
out on this, right?

32:34.380 --> 32:35.548
Why not?

32:37.383 --> 32:39.093
Remember I said that
if we go down,

32:39.302 --> 32:40.762
we're all gonna go
down together?

32:41.387 --> 32:43.765
Michael, we almost went
to jail today.

32:51.439 --> 32:52.940
Look Christian I know that
you're scared.

32:53.983 --> 32:56.194
You cannot just walk out
on us man, we need you.

32:56.277 --> 32:57.987
For what? My van?

33:05.995 --> 33:07.955
Would it help if you
were getting a larger share?

33:14.170 --> 33:15.254
I don't know.

33:15.880 --> 33:17.548
We are using your parents van.

33:17.799 --> 33:19.592
You have more to lose
than the rest of us.

33:27.558 --> 33:28.893
How big?

33:32.855 --> 33:34.273
How does five percent sound?

33:39.320 --> 33:40.738
I appreciate it man, I.

33:40.863 --> 33:43.116
W-Well listen man,
you could get your own spot.

33:43.282 --> 33:44.575
Move out of the basement.

33:46.828 --> 33:48.121
What about the guys?

33:48.746 --> 33:51.624
- Aren't-aren't they gonna be pissed?
- I'll handle that.

33:57.922 --> 33:59.173
[Michael] Can you let me out?

34:00.216 --> 34:01.676
[Christian] Yeah,
it should be unlocked.

34:02.176 --> 34:03.636
[Michael] It's not,
can you unlock it?

34:04.929 --> 34:05.972
Does that work?

34:06.055 --> 34:07.974
No, you got, you got
to unlock it.

34:08.224 --> 34:09.350
I'm pushing it.

34:09.434 --> 34:12.645
- Well it's not unlocking.
- Um, well are you jiggling the handle?

34:12.937 --> 34:16.149
- You gotta like...
- Getaway van, I can't even get outside the van, man.

34:17.275 --> 34:20.445
Never mind, I'll just
take the side door.

34:20.820 --> 34:22.362
See you later.

34:24.239 --> 34:25.533
[door slides shut]

34:34.042 --> 34:35.543
Jessica Horton.

34:35.877 --> 34:37.003
[chuckles] No way.

34:37.085 --> 34:41.215
Out of all the girls from our class, that's
the one you'd let put a finger up your butt?

34:41.340 --> 34:42.592
Oh yeah.

34:42.967 --> 34:45.428
I'd put a ring on
that finger, after it.

34:45.887 --> 34:47.597
She has such big hands.

34:50.933 --> 34:52.018
[chuckles]

34:52.768 --> 34:54.270
[chuckles] Oh!

34:54.437 --> 34:57.148
- So did you guys kiss and make up?
- Shut up John.

34:59.859 --> 35:00.902
So...

35:01.611 --> 35:02.904
Where do we hit next?

35:03.488 --> 35:04.530
[phone ringing in distance]

35:04.614 --> 35:07.867
Hello miss, I'm detective Sinclair,
I'd like to ask you a few questions,

35:07.950 --> 35:09.285
and then we'll send you home.

35:10.703 --> 35:12.497
What can you tell me
about the robbers?

35:13.122 --> 35:14.499
Well there were four of them.

35:14.665 --> 35:15.792
Mm-hmm.

35:16.125 --> 35:18.211
And one of the guys,
when he came in,

35:18.336 --> 35:20.088
he shot his gun up in the air.

35:21.297 --> 35:23.216
What other kind of weapons
did they have?

35:23.508 --> 35:27.095
One had a golf club, and the
other had an old west riffle.

35:27.303 --> 35:31.224
And the smaller guy had a cane
or something, weird.

35:32.600 --> 35:33.726
Something weird.

35:35.561 --> 35:36.854
Anything else?

35:38.356 --> 35:40.274
They called each other by name.

35:42.318 --> 35:43.653
Do you remember them?

35:44.862 --> 35:46.656
Dean, Frankie,

35:47.323 --> 35:49.575
Joey, and...

35:52.537 --> 35:53.538
Was it Sam?

35:53.955 --> 35:55.164
Yes!

35:57.625 --> 35:59.836
I guess that,
they were code names.

36:00.837 --> 36:01.921
I see.

36:03.172 --> 36:06.718
Is there anything else you
remember that was, seemed unusual?

36:07.927 --> 36:10.596
I couldn't see their faces,
but they sounded young.

36:10.805 --> 36:11.973
Twenties.

36:12.890 --> 36:15.476
See, I don't think they knew
what they were doing.

36:23.401 --> 36:24.986
[officer] Press conference,
in a few hours.

36:25.403 --> 36:26.571
- Excellent.
- [phone dialing]

36:28.448 --> 36:29.699
We'll keep looking
for the bullet.

36:30.533 --> 36:32.035
Don't worry about the bullet.

36:33.327 --> 36:34.328
Why?

36:35.038 --> 36:36.664
We're dealing with amateurs.

36:37.582 --> 36:39.292
He fired a cap gun.

36:43.087 --> 36:45.923
- What's this?
- This is the north point, second bank.

36:46.299 --> 36:48.509
Oh guys, I go to this bank.

36:48.676 --> 36:49.886
Do we have to go there?

36:50.053 --> 36:51.846
Yeah, all the more reason
to go there.

36:51.971 --> 36:54.057
Now, this won't be like
the general bank, ok?

36:54.223 --> 36:55.892
This time we're up
against two security guards.

36:55.975 --> 36:58.269
- Are they any tough?
- No, they're mostly interns.

36:58.394 --> 36:59.562
- That's it?
- Yeah.

36:59.645 --> 37:02.523
Which means, they'll be just
as hot headed, as John here.

37:02.815 --> 37:03.858
What else?

37:04.025 --> 37:07.028
Standard camera's, and two to three
tellers, depending on the time of day.

37:08.321 --> 37:10.406
Hey guys, check this out.

37:13.576 --> 37:17.205
[volume low]

37:17.455 --> 37:18.790
Christian turn it up.

37:19.457 --> 37:21.709
[Sinclair] So the suspects came
into the bank you see,

37:21.793 --> 37:24.462
but not much is known about the
suspects at this time.

37:24.545 --> 37:26.255
[reporter] Did eye witnesses
give any information?

37:26.339 --> 37:28.841
They mentioned they came in
armed and masked.

37:29.384 --> 37:31.803
One young woman said they
came in, dashing.

37:32.011 --> 37:33.805
- [John] That teller wants me.
- Shut up.

37:34.847 --> 37:36.391
Make no mistake about it,

37:36.599 --> 37:39.394
these four men are dangerous,
and should not be taken lightly.

37:40.728 --> 37:43.147
- [Levi] Holy shit.
- [John] I know.

37:43.398 --> 37:45.233
Looks like we're
somewhat famous.

37:45.942 --> 37:47.318
Technically infamous.

37:47.402 --> 37:49.278
Shut the fuck up, Christian.

37:49.987 --> 37:50.988
Huh.

37:51.155 --> 37:52.699
Wonder why they didn't show us.

37:53.700 --> 37:55.243
Cause they don't have anything.

37:56.369 --> 37:57.787
[claps] Let's plan
the next job.

37:58.746 --> 38:00.289
Wait, don't you wanna
wait a week?

38:00.373 --> 38:01.499
Till the heat dies over?

38:01.791 --> 38:03.584
They've got nothing on us,
we're in the clear.

38:03.876 --> 38:04.877
Right.

38:05.169 --> 38:07.463
But if we wait a couple weeks
they won't be expecting us.

38:07.547 --> 38:09.841
They're not going to be waiting
for us, you heard that jag off.

38:09.924 --> 38:11.342
They think we're professionals.

38:11.634 --> 38:13.052
Yeah, and if anything,

38:13.261 --> 38:15.096
we should do this,
sooner rather than later.

38:15.346 --> 38:18.474
Right, which is why we're gonna
hit the next bank tomorrow.

38:19.517 --> 38:20.518
That quick?

38:20.768 --> 38:23.021
Yeah it's perfect,
it's on the very edge of town,

38:23.187 --> 38:24.897
and they won't expect us
to hit so soon.

38:25.064 --> 38:26.482
[John] Same plan as before?

38:27.525 --> 38:29.527
Sort of, you me and Levi
are going to go in.

38:29.694 --> 38:32.697
Christian's gonna wait for us in the getaway
van in the parking lot across the street.

38:32.780 --> 38:34.365
Wa-wait, how come he
gets the easy job?

38:34.449 --> 38:36.743
- I thought he was supposed to be the lookout?
- He's gonna do both.

38:36.826 --> 38:39.120
He's gonna watch the street for
us, while we're on the inside.

38:40.663 --> 38:42.290
And John, no shooting this time.

38:43.166 --> 38:44.333
Yeah.

38:47.253 --> 38:48.880
- [knocks]
- Detective.

38:50.048 --> 38:51.049
Yeah?

38:51.716 --> 38:54.427
Is there a reason you went off
script for the press conference?

38:57.013 --> 38:58.431
We're up against kids.

38:59.057 --> 39:01.351
Now if I said that,
they'd be more cautions.

39:02.185 --> 39:04.354
This way they might be more
liable to screw up.

39:06.147 --> 39:07.440
When do you think they'll
do it again?

39:09.525 --> 39:11.444
If they're smart, they'll quit
while they're ahead.

39:12.153 --> 39:13.196
But they're not.

39:14.322 --> 39:16.449
I expect another robbery
within the week.

39:17.367 --> 39:19.494
We only have six officers
on the roster.

39:19.744 --> 39:21.662
[chuckles] Trust me.

39:22.205 --> 39:23.790
We're still better equipped.

39:32.715 --> 39:33.841
What are we waiting for?

39:34.342 --> 39:36.302
Michael doesn't want
too many people inside.

39:36.761 --> 39:37.845
So what?

39:38.179 --> 39:39.639
Too many eyes
and people to watch.

39:40.056 --> 39:41.349
We've got time.

39:43.017 --> 39:44.018
Code names?

39:45.603 --> 39:46.604
Deano.

39:47.021 --> 39:48.147
Sammy.

39:49.190 --> 39:50.608
And you get to be Frank again?

39:51.567 --> 39:52.568
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

39:52.860 --> 39:55.446
I just pictured you more
as a Peter Lawford type.

39:56.614 --> 39:58.700
Well we can change your name to
Jamie Joy Bishop as well.

40:00.159 --> 40:01.411
I like Deano.

40:03.996 --> 40:04.997
Show time.

40:07.417 --> 40:09.127
- Walkie check.
- Check.

40:10.920 --> 40:12.547
Hey, remember no shooting
this time.

40:12.755 --> 40:14.340
Yeah I got it, let's go.

40:27.145 --> 40:28.646
Everyone on the floor!

40:30.732 --> 40:31.941
Drop your weapon!

40:49.083 --> 40:50.668
Make sure to watch him boys.

40:55.298 --> 40:56.841
[Levi] This one's good.

40:57.008 --> 40:58.301
Get another one.

40:58.926 --> 41:00.094
Sammy how we doing on time?

41:00.178 --> 41:01.763
Uh, two and a half minutes.

41:03.139 --> 41:04.891
Alright, we're doing
great everybody.

41:05.141 --> 41:07.727
Just keep your heads down,
we'll be out of here soon.

41:09.854 --> 41:11.189
[beeping]

41:12.231 --> 41:13.608
[beeping]

41:17.403 --> 41:18.654
[beeping]

41:25.370 --> 41:26.954
Oh, shit.

41:27.455 --> 41:28.706
Fuck, Michael.

41:33.378 --> 41:34.712
Frank!

41:36.672 --> 41:38.383
- Shit.
- [group softly scream]

41:38.883 --> 41:40.385
Out! Everyone get out!

41:41.177 --> 41:42.804
[people screaming]

41:45.640 --> 41:47.225
[officer] Police department!

41:47.392 --> 41:48.935
Drop your gun!

41:49.102 --> 41:50.687
Fucking Christian!

41:50.770 --> 41:51.896
[officer] Do it now!

41:52.897 --> 41:54.273
Door!

41:54.857 --> 41:56.567
[gunshots]

41:56.943 --> 41:58.778
- [officer] Drop your guns!
- Look at the door!

42:01.322 --> 42:02.824
[officer] Show me your hands!

42:04.409 --> 42:06.285
[officer] Roll in on my signal,
we're going left.

42:17.380 --> 42:19.465
[gunshots]

42:19.966 --> 42:21.634
- [officer] Do no move!
- Christian.

42:21.718 --> 42:23.553
-[Christian] Michael!-Christian, come in!

42:23.636 --> 42:24.679
[Christian] Michael!

42:25.054 --> 42:26.597
Christian, come in!

42:26.889 --> 42:29.350
-[Christian] Michael!-Christian, where are you?

42:31.728 --> 42:34.897
- Michael!
- Christian go to the bank side alley now!

42:38.568 --> 42:39.861
[gunshots]

42:40.528 --> 42:41.779
[car horn beeping]

42:46.951 --> 42:48.036
Go!

42:55.084 --> 42:56.836
[gunshots]

42:57.545 --> 42:58.796
[gunshots]

43:00.173 --> 43:01.883
[gunshots]

43:03.134 --> 43:04.469
- [grunts]
- Come on, let's go, let's go.

43:04.594 --> 43:06.095
[gunshots]

43:06.804 --> 43:08.181
[gunshots]

43:11.017 --> 43:12.560
[gunshots]

43:15.772 --> 43:17.148
[gunshots]

43:17.398 --> 43:18.733
Oh, shit!

43:18.941 --> 43:20.485
Oh bastard!

43:21.110 --> 43:22.320
Warp it up!

43:23.321 --> 43:25.073
Christian, what the fuck!

43:25.156 --> 43:26.783
They came out of nowhere man!

43:26.866 --> 43:29.243
- Bullshit!
- Fuck they were waiting for us!

43:30.036 --> 43:32.288
- Fuck!
- Alright, everyone shut up!

43:33.706 --> 43:35.083
Get us to the RV now.

43:35.583 --> 43:37.293
Tell me we got the
fucking money.

43:37.377 --> 43:39.337
- Yeah we got it!
- Thank God.

43:41.923 --> 43:44.550
Holy, you don't think this shit
could kill me right?

43:44.634 --> 43:47.804
[John] This? No dude you're,
unless you're a bitch.

43:48.888 --> 43:51.015
[Levi] Fuck, I kinda feel like
I'm going into shock.

43:51.099 --> 43:53.059
[John] You're not going into
shock, you're fine.

43:53.142 --> 43:55.269
- Ok, you're fine.
- Ok, ok, ok.

44:05.029 --> 44:06.239
[grunting]

44:06.531 --> 44:07.699
- [grunts]
- You're fine.

44:12.495 --> 44:14.455
- [Christian] Listen Michael...
- What the fuck happened!

44:14.539 --> 44:17.208
Dude, they were,
they were waiting for us.

44:17.625 --> 44:18.835
Why didn't you warn us?

44:18.918 --> 44:20.545
Cause I dropped my walkie!

44:20.795 --> 44:22.755
- What!
- I dropped the walkie!

44:37.311 --> 44:39.731
Hey, the bleeding's slowing down,
but we got to get that bullet out,

44:39.814 --> 44:41.399
or he's gonna die of infection.

44:44.485 --> 44:45.737
Can we get him to a hospital?

44:46.195 --> 44:47.613
Alright, help me get him
in my truck.

44:47.697 --> 44:49.032
What are you idiots,
we can't do that!

44:49.157 --> 44:50.199
Why not?

44:50.408 --> 44:52.702
Cause every cop in town
will be waiting for us.

44:56.998 --> 44:58.249
What are we gonna do?

45:02.086 --> 45:03.796
I-I'm thinking, ok.

45:05.965 --> 45:08.634
Alright, move the money into the
RV, I'll go get my truck.

45:09.594 --> 45:10.678
Where are we going?

45:10.887 --> 45:11.888
Just do it.

45:17.560 --> 45:18.811
[Detective] Anything?

45:20.104 --> 45:22.190
Cases match, bank security.

45:22.815 --> 45:25.360
But one of our boys managed to hit
one of them in the leg as he fled.

45:25.485 --> 45:26.527
Good.

45:27.028 --> 45:28.821
Have we already got
officers on hospital watch?

45:28.905 --> 45:31.199
- Right after the incident.
- Good.

45:33.451 --> 45:34.827
We'll get them yet.

45:38.831 --> 45:40.458
[police radio]

45:49.092 --> 45:50.468
Where are we going?

45:50.718 --> 45:52.053
Trust me on this.

46:01.354 --> 46:02.772
[John] Do you think
he's telling the truth?

46:04.107 --> 46:05.358
He is.

46:06.025 --> 46:08.820
Really? Cause he didn't warn us.

46:09.821 --> 46:11.572
He would have left us,
if that was the case.

46:12.115 --> 46:14.033
He got us out of there
just fine too.

46:14.242 --> 46:15.952
He also go Levi shot.

46:16.577 --> 46:18.162
That was on all of us.

46:29.090 --> 46:30.133
What are we doing here?

46:30.216 --> 46:31.884
She's the only person
who can help us.

46:31.968 --> 46:33.094
John you got to be kidding me.

46:33.177 --> 46:34.846
It's either her, or jail.

46:41.561 --> 46:42.770
[John] Stay with Levi.

47:16.304 --> 47:17.597
Why are you here?

47:18.306 --> 47:19.307
Nice to see you too.

47:19.390 --> 47:22.060
- Jesus Christ, that didn't take long.
- [Michael] Shut up Levi.

47:22.310 --> 47:24.437
- You hate the sight of blood.
- I got better.

47:26.898 --> 47:28.733
What the hell happened to him?

47:29.567 --> 47:32.987
Ah we went uh, hunting and
someone accidentally shot him.

47:33.488 --> 47:34.781
Jesus.

47:35.114 --> 47:37.158
Why didn't you take him to a
hospital, I'm a veterinarian.

47:37.241 --> 47:38.242
Yeah dude, really?

47:38.409 --> 47:41.371
- [Ann] Fuck you, Michael.
- If we went to the hospital,

47:41.704 --> 47:43.956
they would have taken away
our hunting licenses.

47:51.798 --> 47:53.007
Get his leg leveled.

47:53.341 --> 47:54.634
That's only if the bones
broken.

47:54.717 --> 47:56.552
It is you stupid fuck.

47:58.513 --> 47:59.514
[grunts]

48:01.933 --> 48:03.559
Crushing my testicles
right now.

48:03.643 --> 48:05.812
[Ann] Ok, it's either this
or I call an ambulance.

48:06.521 --> 48:08.231
- Give me my clamps.
- What?

48:08.606 --> 48:09.774
It's in the medical kit.

48:10.024 --> 48:11.776
Christian, Michael,
I need you to hold him down.

48:11.901 --> 48:14.278
- Ah what?
- [Ann] Try not to move, and I'll be quick!

48:14.946 --> 48:15.988
Right Michael?

48:16.572 --> 48:18.074
[all chuckle]

48:25.957 --> 48:28.876
Ok, John grab his ankles,
Michael get me my clamps.

48:35.216 --> 48:36.592
[Ann] Ok Levi, hold still.

48:38.511 --> 48:39.721
Tweezers.

48:41.055 --> 48:42.181
Ok.

48:46.519 --> 48:47.770
Still squeamish?

48:48.062 --> 48:49.230
I'll manage.

48:51.274 --> 48:53.484
Ok Michael, I need you to look,
if you see the bullet, tell me.

48:53.651 --> 48:56.154
- Can't you?
- Michael, stop being a pussy.

48:56.446 --> 48:57.447
Help!

48:57.613 --> 49:00.867
- Levi hold still.
- You try have a fucking bullet removed, ok?

49:01.701 --> 49:02.702
[grunts]

49:05.705 --> 49:07.373
There! Right there.

49:07.874 --> 49:09.042
Ok Levi.

49:09.584 --> 49:10.918
I'm not going to lie to you.

49:11.127 --> 49:12.962
This is going to hurt
really bad.

49:13.588 --> 49:15.048
Michael, get ready for
the pressure.

49:15.131 --> 49:16.674
Guys hold him tight.

49:17.091 --> 49:18.217
[exhales]

49:20.011 --> 49:21.763
Chris, fuck you Christian!

49:21.888 --> 49:23.264
I got this.

49:29.145 --> 49:30.355
[grunts]

49:42.241 --> 49:43.326
Thank you.

49:46.204 --> 49:47.455
He's gonna be ok, right?

49:48.790 --> 49:50.708
Lucky for him it missed
his artery, but,

49:50.875 --> 49:52.835
he's got a minor fracture
to his bone, so.

49:53.252 --> 49:54.712
He can see a doctor tomorrow.

50:04.180 --> 50:05.515
Do you have anything to drink?

50:14.148 --> 50:15.274
Hey John.

50:16.818 --> 50:18.361
Why don't you take Christian
and go grab a drink?

50:38.047 --> 50:39.132
You look good.

50:45.304 --> 50:46.931
What really happened, Michael?

50:47.557 --> 50:48.891
Went hunting.

50:49.350 --> 50:50.810
And we got drunk.

50:51.394 --> 50:52.854
Jesus Christ.

50:53.104 --> 50:54.147
I know.

50:54.522 --> 50:57.984
- You could have killed one of your best friends.
- I know, I'm sorry.

50:58.943 --> 51:00.445
Don't tell me,

51:00.611 --> 51:01.779
tell him.

51:03.448 --> 51:07.535
Michael, if you didn't come to me or
anyone else, he could have lost his foot.

51:09.871 --> 51:12.248
Look we've kind of being going
through uh, rough time.

51:12.540 --> 51:13.833
Since graduation.

51:14.500 --> 51:15.585
Them or you?

51:18.337 --> 51:20.423
You had your chance, remember?

51:21.883 --> 51:25.136
I mean, you wanted to stay here
with your idiot friends.

51:33.519 --> 51:34.729
You're right.

51:39.275 --> 51:41.861
I should have told him then and
there, that we were gonna leave.

51:42.028 --> 51:43.321
And start fresh.

51:45.323 --> 51:47.325
And maybe if I'd kept
that promise.

51:48.701 --> 51:49.952
You wouldn't have had
to stay here.

51:54.832 --> 51:56.459
It's my fault you're
living in this dump.

51:56.709 --> 51:59.879
- Hey!
- Hey, sorry about that too.

52:07.595 --> 52:09.514
And I'm sorry about ending
what we had.

52:11.974 --> 52:14.227
You called me a bitch
in front of your friends.

52:16.813 --> 52:18.356
I've been regretting that
for a while.

52:21.526 --> 52:22.819
You deserve better.

52:32.078 --> 52:33.579
You know you shouldn't
smoke inside.

52:33.746 --> 52:35.373
[Ann] Yeah, why would
you care?

52:44.298 --> 52:45.842
[Levi] Smooth.

52:57.395 --> 52:58.396
You coming?

53:06.863 --> 53:10.199
- [coughing]
- [chuckles]

53:10.783 --> 53:13.745
Oh, you're a pussy now.

53:14.787 --> 53:16.873
When's the last time you smoked?

53:17.498 --> 53:18.875
Probably like a year back.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.418
[both chuckle]

53:22.086 --> 53:24.630
Hey, do you remember that time
at Duke's house party?

53:25.715 --> 53:26.883
Parts.

53:27.842 --> 53:30.219
Ok well, do you remember
asking me if,

53:30.386 --> 53:33.306
I ever thought about us,
you know, getting married.

53:35.266 --> 53:36.392
Not really.

53:37.518 --> 53:39.145
Yeah, you were pretty wasted.

53:40.646 --> 53:42.273
Yeah, thank God I don't
remember that.

53:43.358 --> 53:46.444
Does explain though why I vaguely recall
John calling me a homo the whole night.

53:46.778 --> 53:48.279
Oh, God.

53:48.571 --> 53:50.114
You know who I feel about him.

53:51.991 --> 53:53.910
But I can see that
he's a good friend.

53:55.787 --> 53:57.789
I guess I can see why
you stayed.

53:59.624 --> 54:01.709
Yeah I just,
couldn't leave him by himself.

54:02.543 --> 54:04.754
Or the others, you know
they're like brothers to me.

54:07.298 --> 54:09.217
It's what I've always
liked about you Michael.

54:09.592 --> 54:10.968
You've always been loyal.

54:14.138 --> 54:15.306
[chuckles]

54:15.515 --> 54:16.683
What?

54:16.808 --> 54:18.726
Remember that time
at Dolph's house?

54:19.560 --> 54:23.940
Is that the same night that Christian
ran like bat out of hell from the cops?

54:24.065 --> 54:25.942
No that was a different night.

54:26.734 --> 54:28.236
But remember Fay Anderson?

54:29.237 --> 54:31.781
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,
she was really nice.

54:32.073 --> 54:33.199
Yeah.

54:34.575 --> 54:36.619
She tried to make out with me
while you were in the bathroom.

54:38.079 --> 54:40.081
- What a bitch.
- [chuckles]

54:40.957 --> 54:43.584
- Wait what did you do?
- I just walked away.

54:44.752 --> 54:46.212
Well why didn't you tell me?

54:46.713 --> 54:49.048
Cause you were drunk and you've
got a hell of a right hook.

54:49.507 --> 54:50.842
Yeah, that's true.

54:56.848 --> 54:58.474
Doesn't mean that
I'm loyal though.

55:00.184 --> 55:01.436
What do you mean?

55:03.855 --> 55:05.565
Like yeah, I didn't
do anything with her...

55:07.650 --> 55:09.610
Honestly I just didn't want
to change what I had.

55:11.237 --> 55:12.363
What we had?

55:13.740 --> 55:14.949
I don't know.

55:16.868 --> 55:19.787
Now if that was the case, I would have left
with you instead of screwing you over.

55:21.080 --> 55:22.749
You wanted to stay
with your friends.

55:22.957 --> 55:24.417
[Michael] No, I didn't.

55:25.543 --> 55:26.794
That's the thing...

55:28.546 --> 55:29.964
I didn't even want to...

55:30.256 --> 55:31.716
To stay...

55:32.508 --> 55:33.801
I was just scared.

55:35.094 --> 55:36.346
I was scared of change.

55:40.058 --> 55:41.267
I had...

55:41.642 --> 55:42.977
Everything, I had...

55:44.812 --> 55:46.397
Best friends, best girlfriend.

55:47.440 --> 55:48.608
Best life.

55:50.485 --> 55:51.861
I was afraid to lose it.

55:52.987 --> 55:54.489
Don't, don't.

55:56.157 --> 55:58.993
Michael, you can't beat
yourself up over this.

55:59.494 --> 56:02.288
Honestly, I said you were loyal,
not perfect.

56:03.706 --> 56:05.333
We come from a small town.

56:06.125 --> 56:08.252
It's better to stay somewhere
where you can be happy.

56:08.378 --> 56:10.046
[scoffs] But look at
what happened.

56:10.588 --> 56:13.674
I almost got Levi killed just because I wanted
to do something different, something exciting.

56:13.758 --> 56:16.010
[Ann] So you wanted to drink
and shoot,

56:16.094 --> 56:18.096
- it wasn't your fault.
- It is.

56:18.680 --> 56:21.349
I convinced him into doing
something dangerous, just because,

56:21.891 --> 56:23.101
I wanted some excitement.

56:23.226 --> 56:24.352
Michael. [scoffs]

56:24.519 --> 56:26.521
You, you can't let one slip up,

56:26.604 --> 56:29.482
stop you from doing what you
feel like you need to do.

56:35.238 --> 56:36.447
You really believe that?

56:38.783 --> 56:41.119
Just, just, don't be an idiot.

56:42.787 --> 56:46.249
[scoffs] Though you know, with John
around that might be kind of a problem.

56:46.416 --> 56:47.583
[chuckles]

56:55.800 --> 56:56.884
You know.

56:57.927 --> 56:59.846
I meant every word
I said downstairs.

57:01.973 --> 57:03.099
I know.

57:04.892 --> 57:07.020
You know, it's not hard
to tell when you're lying.

57:19.574 --> 57:21.242
[John] What the hell are
you doing up there?

57:21.909 --> 57:22.952
What do you want?

57:23.036 --> 57:24.412
Hey how's Levi doing?

57:24.579 --> 57:26.789
[John] Levi's fine,
he's been up for a while.

57:35.590 --> 57:36.674
Where have you two been?

57:37.633 --> 57:38.676
How you doing?

57:40.845 --> 57:43.639
Besides the constant throb
in my leg, not too bad.

57:45.600 --> 57:46.601
And how are you feeling?

57:47.060 --> 57:48.519
I've had a few of these, so.

57:49.270 --> 57:50.271
Better.

57:52.982 --> 57:55.026
Alright, let's go.

58:06.579 --> 58:07.830
[Levi grunts]

58:09.165 --> 58:10.583
[Levi] Thanks Ann.

58:12.251 --> 58:13.711
[Ann] Goodnight guys.

58:37.527 --> 58:39.278
Hey, how uh,
much we get off with?

58:40.405 --> 58:41.406
Plenty.

58:42.240 --> 58:43.449
Keep adding zero's to mine.

58:45.159 --> 58:46.953
Yeah, not to be a dick, but,

58:47.328 --> 58:50.873
shouldn't I be compensated for you
know, taking a bullet to the leg?

58:50.998 --> 58:53.334
- We took you to the doctor.
- You took me to a vet.

58:53.584 --> 58:55.002
Oh yeah, reminds me.

58:56.796 --> 58:58.506
What's this for?
My heart worms?

58:58.589 --> 59:00.550
- Oh painkillers.
- [chuckles]

59:00.842 --> 59:02.010
- Fuck off.
- Come on, hook it up.

59:02.093 --> 59:03.761
I earned these, dick.

59:04.095 --> 59:05.638
Better get well soon, man.

59:06.639 --> 59:08.016
We're gonna hit another bank.

59:08.725 --> 59:09.767
What?

59:11.102 --> 59:12.103
You're kidding right?

59:12.395 --> 59:14.480
Well I mean like not right now,
but you know like,

59:14.731 --> 59:15.773
whenever you get better.

59:17.066 --> 59:19.986
Dude, the last time
we almost got caught.

59:20.611 --> 59:23.156
- But this time we almost died.
- So we're gonna plan better.

59:23.239 --> 59:26.409
[Levi] I don't know Michael, I was
down for the last job, but...

59:26.659 --> 59:27.785
I got shot in the leg.

59:28.244 --> 59:30.038
So you both want to quit,
right now?

59:34.709 --> 59:35.835
John?

59:36.919 --> 59:39.464
There's nothing wrong with
quitting while you're a head dude.

59:41.340 --> 59:43.384
Besides Michael,
look at all that cash.

59:43.718 --> 59:45.428
We got exactly what we wanted.

59:46.095 --> 59:47.930
Well how long do you think
it's going to last us?

59:48.306 --> 59:50.308
Because knowing us,
it won't last us six months.

59:50.475 --> 59:51.934
Give us some credit dude.

59:52.060 --> 59:54.687
- So what, just go back to what we did before?
- Yeah.

59:54.896 --> 59:56.356
Go back to what
we were doing before.

59:56.439 --> 59:57.899
Except with a lot of cash.

01:00:00.318 --> 01:00:01.611
Sorry Michael, but,

01:00:02.236 --> 01:00:03.696
it's just the right thing to do.

01:00:10.328 --> 01:00:11.329
Alright.

01:00:12.246 --> 01:00:14.540
[Christian] So, what are
we gonna do now?

01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:17.627
I got some ideas.

01:02:09.113 --> 01:02:10.239
[John] Well...

01:02:11.574 --> 01:02:14.535
I think we can all agree despite the
fact that we're completely broke,

01:02:15.161 --> 01:02:17.497
that was the best couple
months of our life's.

01:02:18.664 --> 01:02:19.749
Yeah.

01:02:20.875 --> 01:02:22.585
Still got to pay my mortgage.

01:02:23.711 --> 01:02:24.837
Which kind of sucks.

01:02:25.588 --> 01:02:27.507
Yeah, we should probably
sell the boat.

01:02:28.966 --> 01:02:30.051
And the cars.

01:02:30.218 --> 01:02:33.221
Man, I just put speakers
in that car.

01:02:33.346 --> 01:02:35.098
We don't have to sell any of it.

01:02:36.599 --> 01:02:40.311
I don't think I have the semen or the
blood to pay off that car, Michael.

01:02:45.942 --> 01:02:47.402
Only as long as I don't
get shot again.

01:02:47.485 --> 01:02:49.737
- Oh I'm in.
- Hey guys.

01:02:51.114 --> 01:02:52.573
Guys I thought we were
done with this?

01:02:52.699 --> 01:02:54.033
Uh, we're not done.

01:02:54.534 --> 01:02:55.535
John.

01:02:55.868 --> 01:02:58.705
- This is a really bad idea.
- Well why's this a bad idea?

01:02:59.706 --> 01:03:02.375
Our last job was months ago,
the heats died down by now.

01:03:02.458 --> 01:03:04.544
Yeah, we've learnt
from our mistakes.

01:03:04.877 --> 01:03:06.212
It's definitely not
the worst idea.

01:03:06.462 --> 01:03:07.547
No.

01:03:07.797 --> 01:03:10.049
In fact, I think it's
a good idea.

01:03:10.258 --> 01:03:11.342
And this time,

01:03:11.634 --> 01:03:15.179
we don't spend the money like idiots ok, I'm
surprised we haven't got caught already.

01:03:16.723 --> 01:03:17.724
Christian?

01:03:18.599 --> 01:03:20.435
Ok, well obviously you're
not gonna listen to me,

01:03:20.518 --> 01:03:22.270
you're gonna go rob a bank,
and get shot again.

01:03:22.353 --> 01:03:23.938
I did-I did not get shot.

01:03:24.397 --> 01:03:26.274
- Levi got shot!
- Shut up, shut your...

01:03:26.357 --> 01:03:27.900
- I'm not gonna shut up.
- Shut your fucking mouth.

01:03:27.984 --> 01:03:30.319
- I'm trying to save your life.
- Shush, shush, shut your...

01:03:30.403 --> 01:03:31.487
[bang]

01:03:32.405 --> 01:03:33.698
[mumbles]

01:03:34.657 --> 01:03:35.783
Sorry.

01:03:38.453 --> 01:03:40.163
Listen, what if I told you guys,

01:03:40.705 --> 01:03:42.206
this will be the last job.

01:03:43.124 --> 01:03:45.168
Are we robbing Fort Knox
or something, bro?

01:03:45.668 --> 01:03:47.378
Well, it's not going
to be a local bank.

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:50.214
You mean like a big
branch bank.

01:03:50.757 --> 01:03:51.758
[chuckles]

01:03:51.966 --> 01:03:53.885
- A big bank.
- Fuck, what do you call it?

01:03:53.968 --> 01:03:56.012
- A national bank?
- Like a big bank.

01:03:56.095 --> 01:03:58.765
[chuckles] Did you even
go to school?

01:03:58.848 --> 01:04:01.100
They don't teach you bank
stuff at school.

01:04:01.434 --> 01:04:04.520
They have more money than any of the
locals banks around here, combined.

01:04:04.854 --> 01:04:06.647
[chuckles] Yeah, true.

01:04:06.814 --> 01:04:08.524
But, they also like,

01:04:08.775 --> 01:04:10.777
they have ramped up security,
I mean do you think,

01:04:10.985 --> 01:04:12.653
don't you think that's
a little out of our league?

01:04:13.154 --> 01:04:14.364
I think we're ready.

01:04:16.574 --> 01:04:17.658
Well...

01:04:18.326 --> 01:04:20.745
What are we gonna use?
Your dad's Winchester riffle?

01:04:21.579 --> 01:04:24.540
I mean it's like a replica
right? It doesn't shoot bullets.

01:04:26.376 --> 01:04:28.002
Mm-hmm, sure.

01:04:30.296 --> 01:04:31.547
[rattling]

01:04:33.007 --> 01:04:36.427
[Michael] During our little vacation
time, I foresaw this happening and uh,

01:04:36.928 --> 01:04:38.805
thought I'd invest
some of our share.

01:04:39.305 --> 01:04:42.016
- Jesus.
- Oh, God bless America.

01:04:42.642 --> 01:04:44.519
Thank God for the
second amendment.

01:04:47.188 --> 01:04:48.439
Alright.

01:04:49.649 --> 01:04:50.817
It's definitely a start.

01:04:53.403 --> 01:04:54.570
[John] What's the plan?

01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:02.787
Yeah, thank you very much.

01:05:05.248 --> 01:05:06.416
Who was that?

01:05:07.291 --> 01:05:09.293
Free clinic on Plaser.

01:05:10.211 --> 01:05:13.548
Some sketchy employees but
no sign of our suspect.

01:05:15.508 --> 01:05:18.594
One of those boys got shot and I
want to know who he want to.

01:05:22.849 --> 01:05:24.225
That's all of them.

01:05:30.398 --> 01:05:31.524
Well.

01:05:32.567 --> 01:05:34.068
No not really.

01:05:35.778 --> 01:05:37.697
There's a lot of names
left off this board.

01:05:38.823 --> 01:05:40.366
My wife got her school
nursing degree online,

01:05:40.450 --> 01:05:42.910
and I'm pretty sure even she knows
how to treat a bullet wound.

01:05:45.204 --> 01:05:46.748
Hell, even a vet could do it.

01:05:53.212 --> 01:05:56.174
[Christian] We have an RV
out in the middle of nowhere.

01:05:56.799 --> 01:05:59.260
Yet we're still planning
in my parents basement?

01:06:00.303 --> 01:06:01.971
I'm superstitious,
what can I say?

01:06:02.555 --> 01:06:06.601
Plus, your stallion mother makes
the best potato skin appetizers.

01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:12.190
Just tell me you got a plan?

01:06:12.774 --> 01:06:14.233
In case cops show up this time.

01:06:15.943 --> 01:06:18.237
If that happens,
we shoot our way out.

01:06:21.115 --> 01:06:22.450
It won't come to it.

01:06:24.994 --> 01:06:26.079
Are we good?

01:06:27.413 --> 01:06:28.456
Alright.

01:06:29.165 --> 01:06:30.333
When do we hit the bank?

01:06:31.167 --> 01:06:32.377
Just give it some time.

01:06:32.794 --> 01:06:33.795
Say three or four days.

01:06:42.804 --> 01:06:44.055
[knocking]

01:06:44.514 --> 01:06:45.640
Come in.

01:06:47.558 --> 01:06:48.726
Detective.

01:06:48.976 --> 01:06:50.228
I'm heading home for the day.

01:06:53.022 --> 01:06:54.357
[officer] Oh shit.

01:06:55.525 --> 01:06:56.693
That's a lot of names.

01:06:59.362 --> 01:07:02.073
Every medical professional
in town.

01:07:02.865 --> 01:07:04.033
Even dentists?

01:07:04.867 --> 01:07:05.910
Yep.

01:07:07.328 --> 01:07:08.621
Anything else.

01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:10.998
No you go on.

01:07:12.917 --> 01:07:14.460
How many times have
you watched that thing?

01:07:16.254 --> 01:07:18.256
You have no idea.

01:07:20.466 --> 01:07:21.718
[door shuts]

01:08:20.859 --> 01:08:22.111
[Sinclair] Baker.

01:08:26.282 --> 01:08:27.617
Baker.

01:08:42.256 --> 01:08:43.383
Can I help you?

01:08:43.966 --> 01:08:45.885
[Sinclair] I'm detective
Sinclair.

01:08:46.176 --> 01:08:48.179
I was hoping to speak
to an Ann Baker.

01:08:48.345 --> 01:08:49.389
That's me.

01:08:49.596 --> 01:08:50.682
Is there something wrong?

01:08:51.015 --> 01:08:54.060
Well I'm sure you heard of the bank
robberies, several months ago?

01:08:54.310 --> 01:08:55.310
Yeah.

01:08:55.895 --> 01:08:59.273
Well one of the perpetrators
is seen on a security tape,

01:08:59.357 --> 01:09:01.442
wearing a bracelet
with your name on it.

01:09:02.193 --> 01:09:04.737
Would you mind telling me
how that may have happened?

01:09:05.529 --> 01:09:07.281
I don't own a bracelet
with my name on it.

01:09:07.532 --> 01:09:10.118
Perhaps you gave it to someone,
a relative perhaps?

01:09:10.201 --> 01:09:11.411
Afraid not detective.

01:09:11.493 --> 01:09:12.787
A boyfriend perhaps?

01:09:15.747 --> 01:09:17.917
- Don't have one.
- Well than an ex-boyfriend?

01:09:18.334 --> 01:09:19.544
Never gave him one.

01:09:22.421 --> 01:09:23.506
Is that all detective?

01:09:25.383 --> 01:09:27.385
Alright well, have
a nice day then.

01:09:49.866 --> 01:09:51.325
[knocking]

01:10:00.209 --> 01:10:01.794
[knocking continues]

01:10:03.129 --> 01:10:05.298
- Ann.
- What did you do?

01:10:05.631 --> 01:10:06.632
What are you talking about?

01:10:06.716 --> 01:10:09.385
You, John, Levi and Christian are
those bank robbers, aren't you?

01:10:09.469 --> 01:10:10.345
No, what?

01:10:10.428 --> 01:10:13.139
- Why?
- A detective came to my house today.

01:10:13.473 --> 01:10:14.849
Did you tell him about Levi?

01:10:14.932 --> 01:10:16.559
No, he didn't ask me
about Levi.

01:10:16.726 --> 01:10:18.895
[indistinctive chatter
in distance]

01:10:23.733 --> 01:10:25.234
Well what did he ask
you about then?

01:10:25.401 --> 01:10:27.528
The bracelet that I gave
you in high school.

01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:30.615
He said that he saw it on some
security tape or something.

01:10:31.991 --> 01:10:33.743
Do I look like a bank robber
to you?

01:10:34.035 --> 01:10:36.913
Who else would have the bracelet
then, Michael?

01:10:37.413 --> 01:10:40.541
I was made when we broke up ok, I left it at
a thrift store someone must've picked it up.

01:10:40.625 --> 01:10:41.626
Yeah and this?

01:10:41.959 --> 01:10:43.127
This wasn't stolen.

01:10:43.211 --> 01:10:44.504
Stop lying to me!

01:10:44.587 --> 01:10:47.090
It's the truth I won it at a
casino a while back, so.

01:10:47.173 --> 01:10:49.092
- I'm not stupid Michael.
- It's the truth!

01:10:49.175 --> 01:10:50.468
[knocking]

01:10:51.636 --> 01:10:52.887
[sighs] Shit.

01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:54.138
- What?
- It's him.

01:10:54.305 --> 01:10:56.099
- Him, who?
- The detective.

01:10:56.474 --> 01:10:58.601
He must have, followed me here.

01:10:59.435 --> 01:11:00.853
To the basement, now.

01:11:01.062 --> 01:11:02.397
Go.

01:11:03.981 --> 01:11:06.401
[grunts] It's Ann,
hide the shit!

01:11:11.989 --> 01:11:13.074
Can I help you?

01:11:13.199 --> 01:11:14.951
I'm sorry to bother you, uh.

01:11:15.118 --> 01:11:16.494
You're Christian Bogart?

01:11:16.703 --> 01:11:18.413
No I'm his friend,
uh Michael.

01:11:19.997 --> 01:11:21.499
You're Michael Stevenson?

01:11:21.874 --> 01:11:23.084
[Michael] That's me.

01:11:23.626 --> 01:11:25.294
I'm detective Sinclair.

01:11:25.753 --> 01:11:27.922
And tell me, do you know
an Ann Baker?

01:11:29.006 --> 01:11:31.175
She's my ex, yeah, why?

01:11:33.136 --> 01:11:35.763
May I come in?
Just for a few questions.

01:11:36.222 --> 01:11:38.057
- Of course.
- Thank you.

01:11:43.312 --> 01:11:44.897
- [clears throat]
- What's up?

01:11:47.650 --> 01:11:48.901
Coffee detective?

01:11:49.652 --> 01:11:51.029
Decafe if you've got it?

01:11:55.283 --> 01:11:56.534
We're out.

01:11:57.535 --> 01:11:59.328
Whatever you've got then
that's fine.

01:12:02.707 --> 01:12:04.584
She's a pretty girl, Ann.

01:12:05.877 --> 01:12:07.545
Whatever happened
between you two?

01:12:08.921 --> 01:12:10.590
Well she had a bit of a temper.

01:12:10.757 --> 01:12:12.008
You know women.

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:14.177
Oh yeah. [chuckles]

01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:16.387
Sounds like my second ex-wife.

01:12:17.347 --> 01:12:18.556
How long were you together?

01:12:19.807 --> 01:12:21.684
Oh started senior year
of high school.

01:12:23.478 --> 01:12:26.356
What made you decide to call it
quits? Or when did that happen?

01:12:27.982 --> 01:12:30.193
Oh uh, about three years ago.

01:12:30.485 --> 01:12:31.694
Wasn't pretty either.

01:12:31.986 --> 01:12:33.196
No, that's a shame.

01:12:34.781 --> 01:12:38.159
Oh a girl like that,
I'd be buying her gifts.

01:12:38.242 --> 01:12:40.495
Like flowers, chocolate.

01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:41.996
Jewelry.

01:12:43.873 --> 01:12:45.291
She ever give you any gifts.

01:12:46.876 --> 01:12:50.171
Oh her gifts didn't usually
come in material form, if you,

01:12:50.671 --> 01:12:51.756
know what I mean.

01:12:53.091 --> 01:12:55.301
[chuckles]

01:12:55.802 --> 01:12:58.262
God, what I wouldn't give
to be young again.

01:12:59.931 --> 01:13:00.932
Any who.

01:13:02.058 --> 01:13:05.103
I wanted to ask you a few
questions about the bank heist

01:13:05.186 --> 01:13:06.813
that took place
a few months ago.

01:13:07.689 --> 01:13:10.191
I'm not really all too familiar
on current events.

01:13:11.109 --> 01:13:12.568
Surely you read the news.

01:13:13.194 --> 01:13:15.238
Actually I-I stick
to comics mostly.

01:13:15.363 --> 01:13:16.739
News tends to depress me.

01:13:18.324 --> 01:13:20.493
Well, let me catch you up.

01:13:22.412 --> 01:13:24.122
A few months ago,

01:13:24.497 --> 01:13:28.251
two of the local banks were
robbed by four men at gun point.

01:13:28.376 --> 01:13:29.419
Really?

01:13:30.169 --> 01:13:33.172
We actually managed to clip one
of them when they were fleeing.

01:13:33.673 --> 01:13:34.716
[chuckles]

01:13:35.174 --> 01:13:37.677
One of them was even stupid
enough to wear a bracelet

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:40.888
with the name Ann Baker on it
at the crime scene.

01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:43.975
- What's going on?
- Shhh.

01:13:44.267 --> 01:13:45.810
Michael's talking
to a detective.

01:13:45.893 --> 01:13:48.771
- About what?
- About the bank you idiots robbed.

01:13:48.855 --> 01:13:50.314
We didn't rob a bank,
are you high?

01:13:50.398 --> 01:13:52.275
Yeah, I got really high
before I came here.

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:56.029
The bracelet led me to Ann.

01:13:56.612 --> 01:13:58.031
And from her to you...

01:13:58.823 --> 01:13:59.907
Just following leads.

01:13:59.991 --> 01:14:01.576
Yeah, yeah, no sure.

01:14:03.286 --> 01:14:04.912
So, like I said,

01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:09.167
one of the robbers was shot in
the leg a few months ago, and,

01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:12.503
I figured by this time he ought
to have a pretty nice scar.

01:14:12.837 --> 01:14:16.758
So, if you just show me your
leg, I can get out of your hair.

01:14:17.550 --> 01:14:18.843
Which one?

01:14:19.886 --> 01:14:20.970
Left one please.

01:14:22.847 --> 01:14:24.349
It's for the case,
or for you detective?

01:14:25.683 --> 01:14:26.893
Humor me.

01:14:31.022 --> 01:14:32.315
Should I turn my head
and cough next?

01:14:35.151 --> 01:14:36.277
My mistake.

01:14:36.986 --> 01:14:39.155
Whatever floats your boat,
you know, I-I don't judge.

01:14:39.739 --> 01:14:41.657
Well, I guess I better
be going.

01:14:42.075 --> 01:14:43.910
You sure, coffee's going
to be on in a second, here.

01:14:44.035 --> 01:14:46.287
[Sinclair] No, I've got
a lot of paper work to do.

01:14:46.996 --> 01:14:48.623
Ca-Can you hear anything?

01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:49.791
No.

01:14:49.957 --> 01:14:51.918
Why did you rob a bank
in the first place?

01:14:52.001 --> 01:14:52.835
We didn't rob a bank.

01:14:52.919 --> 01:14:56.381
Yes you did! They saw on the security camera
Michael's bracelet with my name on it!

01:14:56.464 --> 01:14:58.633
Why would you give him a bracelet
with your fucking name on it?

01:14:58.716 --> 01:15:00.677
I don't know, it was for
his birthday.

01:15:00.927 --> 01:15:02.929
Why couldn't you just blow him,
like every other chick?

01:15:03.012 --> 01:15:04.639
- [loud slap]
- Ow!

01:15:05.807 --> 01:15:07.058
Someone else here?

01:15:07.266 --> 01:15:08.601
Just some friends.

01:15:09.394 --> 01:15:10.812
How many people are down there?

01:15:11.354 --> 01:15:12.605
I don't know, a few.

01:15:13.773 --> 01:15:15.358
Well is it, uh.

01:15:16.984 --> 01:15:18.695
Almost forgot.

01:15:21.322 --> 01:15:22.824
Is it uh...

01:15:25.159 --> 01:15:29.038
John Peterson, Richard Levi
and Christian Bogart?

01:15:29.664 --> 01:15:31.624
Well Christian I assume,
cause it's house.

01:15:32.291 --> 01:15:33.292
Yeah.

01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:35.670
Well what are you all up to?

01:15:35.878 --> 01:15:37.130
Uh, it's movie night.

01:15:37.588 --> 01:15:38.715
Oh.

01:15:38.965 --> 01:15:39.966
What movie?

01:15:40.466 --> 01:15:41.759
Whatever's on.

01:15:42.385 --> 01:15:45.596
Well do you think I could take a trip
down stairs and talk to your friends?

01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:48.266
Why?

01:15:49.642 --> 01:15:51.436
Just wanna ask them
a few questions.

01:15:52.478 --> 01:15:53.730
Check for scars.

01:15:54.188 --> 01:15:57.233
You know actually Christian's not feeling so
well right now and neither are the others.

01:15:57.608 --> 01:15:59.318
Not on movie night.

01:15:59.944 --> 01:16:02.030
I'll tell you what though, why
don't you come back in a few days?

01:16:02.113 --> 01:16:03.531
Well it'll just take
a few minutes.

01:16:03.781 --> 01:16:06.075
I'd really, it's be better if
you come back another time.

01:16:06.242 --> 01:16:07.744
But I'll let you know
if I find any scars.

01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:09.412
Probably check myself.

01:16:11.581 --> 01:16:13.541
Sorry officer I don't know
what to tell ya.

01:16:15.043 --> 01:16:16.878
You're not going to let me go
downstairs, are you?

01:16:18.379 --> 01:16:20.757
Honestly, this is just starting
to get pretty unprofessional,

01:16:21.090 --> 01:16:22.800
and I'm feeling a little
uncomfortable.

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:26.262
You're gonna get those boys
killed, you know that, right?

01:16:27.972 --> 01:16:29.557
Do you have a warrant, officer?

01:16:30.099 --> 01:16:31.100
No.

01:16:31.476 --> 01:16:34.771
Well, not to be rude, but when you
get that warrant you can come back.

01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:39.484
[Sinclair] Enjoy your movie.

01:16:40.026 --> 01:16:41.194
We will.

01:16:41.694 --> 01:16:42.695
[door opens]

01:16:43.571 --> 01:16:44.781
[door shuts]

01:16:45.323 --> 01:16:46.741
[basement door opens]

01:16:52.497 --> 01:16:53.664
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

01:16:53.748 --> 01:16:54.874
- You can't go to the cops.
- I won't.

01:16:54.957 --> 01:16:56.667
- Ann please!
- I won't!

01:16:58.044 --> 01:17:00.088
Even though I should, I won't.

01:17:10.932 --> 01:17:12.934
- Ok we got a problem.
- No shit.

01:17:13.351 --> 01:17:15.353
You wore that fucking
bracelet Ann gave you.

01:17:15.561 --> 01:17:16.688
Why the fuck would
you keep that?

01:17:16.771 --> 01:17:18.731
Why the fuck did you take
it into the bank!

01:17:18.815 --> 01:17:21.192
- I thought it was lucky ok.
- Alright, calm down.

01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:23.903
Ok.

01:17:24.862 --> 01:17:26.280
He didn't take you in.

01:17:26.739 --> 01:17:27.990
So we're fine.

01:17:32.787 --> 01:17:34.789
- We got to hit the bank tomorrow.
- W-What?

01:17:35.707 --> 01:17:37.250
They got nothing right now.

01:17:37.583 --> 01:17:39.669
It won't be long before they start
putting two and two together.

01:17:39.752 --> 01:17:40.878
Are you insane?

01:17:41.087 --> 01:17:43.256
- The heat is up!
- All the more reason, to hit tomorrow.

01:17:43.506 --> 01:17:45.258
That detective is going
to go door to door,

01:17:45.425 --> 01:17:47.051
will we make off
with a shit ton of cash.

01:17:47.135 --> 01:17:48.594
I don't know dude,
we got to lay low.

01:17:48.678 --> 01:17:50.722
You got to trust me on this when
I say this is the right time.

01:17:50.805 --> 01:17:52.056
I say we wait.

01:17:52.348 --> 01:17:54.017
We wait, we get arrested.

01:17:54.642 --> 01:17:56.769
If we hit tomorrow, at least we
can run with enough cash to hide.

01:17:56.853 --> 01:17:58.312
So we're screwed either way?

01:18:01.357 --> 01:18:02.567
Come on guys.

01:18:03.151 --> 01:18:04.235
The last job.

01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:07.321
Now who the fuck is with me?

01:18:11.451 --> 01:18:12.618
John?

01:18:19.459 --> 01:18:20.460
Yeah.

01:18:22.545 --> 01:18:23.755
Guys?

01:18:31.054 --> 01:18:33.306
Let's get the weapon's and the
gear from the RV right now.

01:18:57.121 --> 01:18:58.206
So...

01:18:59.165 --> 01:19:00.625
Just a little bit longer.

01:19:00.917 --> 01:19:02.919
We've already been sitting here
for at least ten minutes.

01:19:04.504 --> 01:19:05.671
We wait.

01:19:06.214 --> 01:19:08.549
- Walkie check.
- Check.

01:19:09.342 --> 01:19:10.802
How much we going for?

01:19:12.261 --> 01:19:14.263
Enough for us all to be sitting
pretty in Mexico.

01:19:14.597 --> 01:19:16.974
- Oh that shouldn't be much.
- [chuckles]

01:19:20.812 --> 01:19:22.188
Show time.

01:19:39.872 --> 01:19:42.041
- [John] Dude, what the fuck.
- [Michael] John, I'm sorry.

01:19:42.125 --> 01:19:43.543
- Come on.
- Shut up!

01:20:12.196 --> 01:20:13.906
- Oh shit.
- Go, go, go!

01:20:15.450 --> 01:20:17.285
- What the fuck happened?
- Drive!

01:20:20.621 --> 01:20:21.831
[grunts]

01:20:22.623 --> 01:20:23.875
[Levi] They were
waiting for us!

01:20:23.958 --> 01:20:25.251
What the hell did you
tell that detective?

01:20:25.334 --> 01:20:26.335
Nothing.

01:20:26.544 --> 01:20:27.920
[Christian] We should have
waited man.

01:20:28.004 --> 01:20:29.172
What are we doing now?

01:20:29.630 --> 01:20:31.299
- Get us to the RV.
- Are you nuts?

01:20:31.382 --> 01:20:32.884
We got to lose them first!

01:20:33.009 --> 01:20:34.552
We lost them, keep going!

01:20:41.559 --> 01:20:42.602
We're fucked!

01:20:42.685 --> 01:20:45.021
[Christian] Wouldn't be in this situation
if you didn't wear the bracelet!

01:20:45.104 --> 01:20:46.647
Oh don't you pin this on me!

01:20:47.148 --> 01:20:49.233
No he's right,
you fucked us big time.

01:20:55.615 --> 01:20:57.283
Alright, look guys, I...

01:20:58.701 --> 01:20:59.911
I know it's bad, ok.

01:21:01.079 --> 01:21:03.289
If we hurry we can get all our
stuff and go down to Mexico...

01:21:03.373 --> 01:21:05.958
Let's go to fucking Mexico Michael
because we don't have a fucking choice.

01:21:06.042 --> 01:21:08.795
- Do you guys hear that?
- You could have walked away long before, don't give me that shit.

01:21:08.878 --> 01:21:10.880
- Ah! Fuck you!
- Fuck you Michael!

01:21:11.047 --> 01:21:12.924
- If we just waited!
- If we did we'd all be in jail right now!

01:21:13.007 --> 01:21:14.175
Listen!

01:21:18.179 --> 01:21:20.014
[faint sirens]

01:21:29.941 --> 01:21:31.234
God.

01:21:31.484 --> 01:21:33.236
That blows.

01:21:34.445 --> 01:21:36.155
Everyone get in the RV now.

01:21:46.374 --> 01:21:47.667
Oh shit.

01:21:48.876 --> 01:21:50.211
What do we do?

01:21:59.887 --> 01:22:01.431
Alright Michael.

01:22:02.056 --> 01:22:03.433
You got nowhere to run.

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:06.936
Step out of the RV
nice and slow.

01:22:11.524 --> 01:22:12.650
Dude.

01:22:14.944 --> 01:22:16.279
Dude, what's the plan?

01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:19.782
I don't know.

01:22:19.866 --> 01:22:22.243
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I don't know.

01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:28.833
Fuck this.

01:22:29.959 --> 01:22:31.127
What are you doing?

01:22:32.879 --> 01:22:34.589
Do you know what they do
to guys like me in jail?

01:22:36.382 --> 01:22:38.426
What my mom's going to do,
when she finds out.

01:22:38.676 --> 01:22:40.762
She'll probably stuff you
right back inside of her.

01:22:41.012 --> 01:22:43.264
Right, which is why
we should do this.

01:22:44.557 --> 01:22:46.976
Fuck that. Fuck that!

01:22:48.561 --> 01:22:49.812
Sorry guys.

01:22:53.024 --> 01:22:54.400
Not your fault dude.

01:22:54.984 --> 01:22:57.028
We knew it was all gonna
come to this eventually.

01:22:59.030 --> 01:23:00.239
What?

01:23:00.782 --> 01:23:01.949
Christian.

01:23:02.658 --> 01:23:03.659
Put it down.

01:23:03.785 --> 01:23:05.036
Michael, you shitting me?

01:23:05.119 --> 01:23:07.580
Michael you can't actually
be thinking about jail?

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:11.459
If we go out willingly they
might be lenient on us.

01:23:11.918 --> 01:23:14.003
And, option two?

01:23:16.214 --> 01:23:17.799
There is no option two.

01:23:28.309 --> 01:23:29.727
[sighs]

01:23:30.311 --> 01:23:31.896
Guess of we go down...

01:23:33.356 --> 01:23:35.692
- We go down together.

01:23:38.528 --> 01:23:39.946
