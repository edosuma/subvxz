00:08.690 --> 00:10.613
In the year 2044,

00:11.500 --> 00:14.138
advanced artificial intelligence robots

00:14.140 --> 00:17.928
drained the earth of
her natural resources,

00:17.930 --> 00:22.758
leaving the ones thriving
planet a baron shell.

00:22.760 --> 00:25.108
A drift in space.

00:25.110 --> 00:28.283
The human race fights
its toughest battle ever,

00:29.510 --> 00:30.653
for survival.

00:34.567 --> 00:35.400
A Chinese clone of the 45th
US president Donald J. Trump

00:39.360 --> 00:41.418
survives the earth destruction

00:41.420 --> 00:44.808
by escaping his maximum security lab.

00:44.810 --> 00:46.568
His Petri dish grown body

00:46.570 --> 00:49.098
fused with the latest AI technology

00:49.100 --> 00:53.233
possesses eternal life and large hands.

00:59.130 --> 01:00.818
During his escape from earth

01:00.820 --> 01:03.023
Trump's ship crash lands on Mars.

01:04.410 --> 01:07.078
Unable to leave he exists
for a thousand years

01:07.080 --> 01:10.047
on a barren prison
planet of his own making.

01:16.296 --> 01:18.983
At long
last I Aleister Crowley,

01:20.810 --> 01:23.648
have ascendent to the only position worthy

01:23.650 --> 01:27.653
of a ceremony magician
of my formidable caliber.

01:29.890 --> 01:34.488
Today I stand before the
patron god of the afterlife.

01:34.490 --> 01:36.463
Not merely as an acolyte.

01:37.580 --> 01:41.630
Poet, painter, novelist, mountaineer

01:41.632 --> 01:43.223
great beast.

01:45.060 --> 01:48.557
I stand in this hallowed crept.

01:48.559 --> 01:51.943
The Leader of the Illuminati army.

01:52.800 --> 01:57.598
And as such, I consult with
the oldest Egyptian god.

01:57.600 --> 02:01.093
Not as an acolyte but as an equal.

02:03.169 --> 02:05.673
Great god Anubis leader of lost souls.

02:07.160 --> 02:10.608
Your legacy and the
reverence your name commands,

02:10.610 --> 02:13.558
is indeed to be admired.

02:13.560 --> 02:16.738
The trappings of your palatial gripped

02:16.740 --> 02:18.693
brings me great comfort.

02:19.750 --> 02:23.693
May your words bring me greater insight.

02:25.472 --> 02:28.608
Aleister Crowley
you are worth the magical roams

02:28.610 --> 02:30.535
most degenerate practitioners,

02:30.537 --> 02:33.908
and a true spirit on the living.

02:33.910 --> 02:36.078
Thank you Anubis.

02:36.080 --> 02:39.838
And as the head of the fearsome

02:39.840 --> 02:42.688
yet unseen Illuminati,

02:42.690 --> 02:47.108
your name and this hallowed
ground are forever safe with me.

02:47.110 --> 02:50.078
Spoken like a true believer Crowley

02:50.080 --> 02:52.913
yet there exists other concerns

02:52.915 --> 02:55.938
that will soon en crouch
upon your comfort.

02:55.940 --> 02:57.798
Other concerns?

02:57.800 --> 02:58.898
Such as?

02:58.900 --> 03:01.356
Such the prophecy
which tells of a rise

03:01.358 --> 03:04.234
of the spoiler of the illuminati rein.

03:04.236 --> 03:05.258
Spoiler?

03:05.260 --> 03:07.198
Who would dare oppose us?

03:07.200 --> 03:08.031
Who?

03:08.033 --> 03:10.978
What has mortal fear of being
hung from the highest tree.

03:10.980 --> 03:15.188
Then drawn and quartered
by stampeding stallions.

03:15.190 --> 03:17.240
Being sliced from ] to groin

03:18.280 --> 03:21.288
and put to bed with hungry rats.

03:21.290 --> 03:25.206
Being boiled alive in
a fitted brew of inert.

03:25.208 --> 03:26.124
Who?

03:26.126 --> 03:29.303
The one they call Trump is who.

03:29.305 --> 03:30.888
Trump?

03:31.850 --> 03:33.218
You mean the worst,

03:33.220 --> 03:36.308
most narcissistic buffoonish president

03:36.310 --> 03:39.188
in the history of the
United States of America.

03:39.190 --> 03:43.188
The sitting tyrant who
cavalierly precipitated

03:43.190 --> 03:44.751
the devastating nuclear war

03:44.753 --> 03:47.403
that humanity dreaded for so long.

03:48.757 --> 03:51.110
It is not the
notorious Trump you speak of

03:51.112 --> 03:52.875
that posses this threat.

03:52.877 --> 03:55.238
It is the Chinese clone of his DNA

03:55.240 --> 03:59.853
Who's shall rise to kill lucifer
and destroy the Illuminati.

04:00.966 --> 04:02.525
His clone?

04:02.527 --> 04:04.478
You got to be kidding me.

04:04.480 --> 04:05.823
There's another Trump?

04:07.080 --> 04:08.738
Well, leave it to the Chinese.

04:08.740 --> 04:10.588
Do you expect anything less

04:10.590 --> 04:12.153
from the land of wet workers?

04:13.620 --> 04:17.459
Be warned Crowley the
new trump is out there.

04:17.461 --> 04:22.016
Only he is brush enough to
stand up to the emperor lucifer,

04:22.017 --> 04:25.502
and when he does, the
Illuminati silent control

04:25.504 --> 04:27.927
of the living world will end.

04:27.929 --> 04:30.136
Not if I have anything to say about it.

04:30.138 --> 04:33.465
Thy will is the whole of the law,

04:33.467 --> 04:35.717
and thy will shall be done.

04:44.627 --> 04:47.008
Mars, what's it good for?

04:47.010 --> 04:48.768
Absolute shit.

04:48.770 --> 04:53.757
But this dusty waste land
been home for 999 earth years.

04:55.810 --> 05:00.213
Long enough to make
anyone lose their mind.

05:01.690 --> 05:04.808
Am I of sound mind or have I lost my head?

05:04.810 --> 05:08.688
Cracked up, gun bunkers, lot of blood.

05:08.690 --> 05:11.508
I mean it, how would I even know if I had.

05:11.510 --> 05:13.578
There are things I remember.

05:13.580 --> 05:16.188
Snippets, dream images,

05:16.190 --> 05:20.003
feeling traces of a life before this one.

05:22.130 --> 05:24.053
Life in a different world.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.673
On a different planet.

05:30.710 --> 05:33.528
I was born as some would say created.

05:33.530 --> 05:35.888
Some would say recreated.

05:35.890 --> 05:40.748
Nearly a thousand years ago
in a top secret lab in China.

05:40.750 --> 05:42.658
I so remember the sites.

05:42.660 --> 05:45.318
Faceless scientists with movements,

05:45.320 --> 05:48.518
as mechanical as the
machines they operated.

05:48.520 --> 05:51.503
Gloved hands poking and prodding at will.

05:52.350 --> 05:54.148
For the first year of life.

05:54.150 --> 05:56.198
I never looked into another pair of eyes

05:56.200 --> 06:00.073
that weren't hidden
behind goggles or a mask.

06:00.075 --> 06:02.408
I'd never touched another human

06:02.410 --> 06:06.208
that wasn't under a layer
of latex protection.

06:06.210 --> 06:08.144
It wasn't so bad.

06:08.146 --> 06:10.803
I didn't want to see
those assholes anyway.

06:11.820 --> 06:14.528
They engineered me in a Petri dish.

06:14.530 --> 06:18.168
Wired my lab grown body with
the latest AI technology

06:18.170 --> 06:20.558
and gave me eternal life.

06:20.560 --> 06:23.603
But Immortality is not all
that good attempt to me.

06:25.670 --> 06:27.318
When the great war began,

06:27.320 --> 06:31.358
it's spelled doom for the
earth and its civilizations.

06:31.360 --> 06:33.963
But for me, it was the beginning.

06:35.510 --> 06:39.438
In all the chaos, I broke
out of that lab and got away.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.478
The others perished in the flames of a war

06:42.480 --> 06:44.618
they ultimately helped ignite

06:44.620 --> 06:47.028
and turned a blind eye to.

06:47.030 --> 06:49.658
And their secrets died with them,

06:49.660 --> 06:50.883
all except me.

06:52.460 --> 06:56.368
It wasn't hard to lay
low when the war raged.

06:56.370 --> 06:59.278
People were busy trying to survive,

06:59.280 --> 07:01.668
trying to save themselves.

07:01.670 --> 07:05.083
Buying toilet paper like
there was no tomorrow.

07:07.570 --> 07:09.558
I saw my namesake

07:09.560 --> 07:13.948
assassinated in cold blood
with extreme prejudice

07:13.950 --> 07:14.933
and just as well.

07:17.140 --> 07:19.088
Soon enough, I made it to Wincheng

07:19.090 --> 07:22.358
and hide out on a cargo
hold of a space shuttle

07:22.360 --> 07:24.828
and blast off that radioactive rock

07:24.830 --> 07:26.658
before it all went to hell.

07:26.660 --> 07:31.143
Now I'm here, crash landed on
Mars of all fucking places.

07:34.770 --> 07:37.453
The days are hot, the nights are frigid.

07:42.615 --> 07:46.748
I have no clue how to make this
spaceship operational again,

07:46.750 --> 07:49.343
and no tools to fix it if I did.

07:54.010 --> 07:55.678
I like being left alone.

07:55.680 --> 07:58.718
But a thousand years
without a single visitor

07:58.720 --> 08:01.648
leads to a lot of drunk phases on rocks

08:01.650 --> 08:03.498
and talking to yourself,

08:03.500 --> 08:04.450
I'll tell you that.

08:08.910 --> 08:11.183
These Dusty rocks are my friends.

08:15.610 --> 08:17.008
And the major.

08:17.010 --> 08:20.628
He is a stranded
astronaut, kind of like me.

08:20.630 --> 08:24.938
He found my radio frequency
and we struck a rapport.

08:24.940 --> 08:29.940
Only he's slipping, whereas
I've been keeping it together.

08:29.980 --> 08:33.018
Clone DNAs devil stuck maybe.

08:33.020 --> 08:36.727
Space time slowed the
major's metabolism way down.

08:36.730 --> 08:39.768
But we both know he's dying.

08:39.770 --> 08:41.748
It's been a few days.

08:41.750 --> 08:44.422
I should see how he's doing out there.

08:45.380 --> 08:46.211
What up money?

08:46.213 --> 08:48.308
Ground control to major Tom.

08:48.310 --> 08:52.898
I'm re watching the 2003,
miss universe pageant.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.923
all these old discs still play.

08:56.250 --> 08:58.938
Hey, tell me the truth man.

08:58.940 --> 09:00.408
How many of these broads

09:00.410 --> 09:02.779
did you grab by the pussy?

09:02.781 --> 09:06.718
Technically I didn't
grab anyone's pussy Tom.

09:06.720 --> 09:10.608
I'm not the Donald, I'm just a Donald.

09:10.610 --> 09:13.238
Oh yeah I forgot.

09:13.240 --> 09:16.898
Well, you got the same DNA, right?

09:16.900 --> 09:19.338
So you must remember something.

09:19.340 --> 09:21.878
Which one of these pussies would you grab,

09:21.880 --> 09:23.281
if you could grab one?

09:23.283 --> 09:25.988
I don't think too
much about grabbing pussies,

09:25.990 --> 09:27.328
believe it or not.

09:27.330 --> 09:30.448
No, I don't believe it.

09:30.450 --> 09:32.578
It's true at this point.

09:32.580 --> 09:34.448
I'd settle for just seeing a woman.

09:34.450 --> 09:36.678
I think that'd be nice.

09:36.680 --> 09:38.838
Yeah, tell me about it.

09:38.840 --> 09:41.058
They parade all over the place

09:41.060 --> 09:43.048
On this little screen.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.773
I can't keep my hands off myself.

09:46.643 --> 09:49.268
TMI Tom, TMI.

09:49.270 --> 09:50.493
Yeah, whatever.

09:51.910 --> 09:54.248
Hey, I'm thinking of calling in the bet

09:54.250 --> 09:56.568
on the fights this weekend.

09:56.570 --> 09:59.008
What can you tell me about that Tyson kid?

09:59.010 --> 10:00.588
Tyson kid?

10:00.590 --> 10:05.068
You mean Iron Mike, he retired
over a thousand years ago?

10:05.070 --> 10:06.488
Retired?

10:06.490 --> 10:08.798
He's 20 years old for Christ's sake.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.168
I just saw you guys on TV together.

10:11.170 --> 10:12.778
How you feeling Tom?

10:12.780 --> 10:14.568
Have you had anything to eat today?

10:14.570 --> 10:18.368
No, can't remember the last time I ate.

10:18.370 --> 10:19.698
That's cool though.

10:19.700 --> 10:21.168
I don't feel hungry no more

10:21.170 --> 10:23.308
just comfortably numb.

10:23.310 --> 10:25.698
Well nice talking to you major.

10:25.700 --> 10:27.803
Let's touch base again soon.

10:27.805 --> 10:31.868
You said touch base space humor,

10:31.870 --> 10:32.701
I like that.

10:32.703 --> 10:33.928
Shall long Tom.

10:33.930 --> 10:35.443
See you Mr. President.

10:43.160 --> 10:45.018
Every time I talk to the major,

10:45.020 --> 10:47.228
he gets a little worse,

10:47.230 --> 10:48.928
a little less coherent.

10:48.930 --> 10:50.368
I don't know how much longer he has,

10:50.370 --> 10:54.048
but I know one of these days
he won't be here anymore.

10:54.050 --> 10:56.128
Tom has been the only
voice that I've heard

10:56.130 --> 10:59.714
besides my own since I've been on Mars.

10:59.716 --> 11:02.118
I don't know what I'd do without it.

11:02.120 --> 11:05.448
Keeping him grounded has
also helped me stay grounded.

11:05.450 --> 11:08.583
When he goes, maybe
I'll start to slip too.

11:09.490 --> 11:11.033
Maybe it'll be for the best.

11:13.600 --> 11:14.431
Hello?

11:14.433 --> 11:15.908
Can you hear me?

11:15.910 --> 11:17.210
Is there anyone out there?

11:18.310 --> 11:20.858
I repeat is anyone out there?

11:20.860 --> 11:23.013
Mr. Trump are you there?

11:23.015 --> 11:24.368
Who said that?

11:24.370 --> 11:25.988
My name is Varuna

11:25.990 --> 11:28.558
and I've come a long way to meet you.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.954
You're not an easy clone to find.

11:30.956 --> 11:32.088
This is it.

11:32.090 --> 11:34.398
I'm cracking up just like Tom.

11:34.400 --> 11:37.588
This is not
your imagination Mr. Trump.

11:37.590 --> 11:40.098
We're talking through your audio intercom.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.813
I'm here at your base right outside.

11:43.950 --> 11:46.748
It's safe., the sun is up.

11:46.750 --> 11:48.493
Why don't you come say hello?

11:48.495 --> 11:49.993
Okay.

12:23.216 --> 12:25.338
My god your face.

12:25.340 --> 12:27.528
You're the spitting image of him.

12:27.530 --> 12:29.198
How are you Donald?

12:29.200 --> 12:30.448
Call me Trump.

12:30.450 --> 12:31.698
Very well.

12:31.700 --> 12:34.858
I see you've carved out a life
for yourself here on Mars.

12:34.860 --> 12:36.908
If that's what you want to call it.

12:36.910 --> 12:37.948
Who are you?

12:37.950 --> 12:41.267
I'm Queen Varuna
leader of the Atlantean army.

12:41.269 --> 12:42.508
The Atlantean?

12:42.510 --> 12:43.858
Strong fighters.

12:43.860 --> 12:46.258
We've heard of you to Trump.

12:46.260 --> 12:47.358
Why are we talking?

12:47.360 --> 12:50.161
I have information I'd
like to share with you.

12:50.163 --> 12:53.628
I don't make deals,
that was the other guy.

12:53.630 --> 12:54.858
This isn't a deal.

12:54.860 --> 12:56.683
You have no choice in the matter.

12:56.685 --> 12:57.698
No?

12:57.700 --> 12:58.948
Then fuck off.

12:58.950 --> 13:01.738
Something told me you'd be friendlier,

13:01.740 --> 13:03.310
after so much time alone.

13:03.312 --> 13:06.628
You shouldn't listen to those
voices in your alien skull.

13:06.630 --> 13:10.635
I don't, but I do
listen to ancient prophecy.

13:10.637 --> 13:12.208
And this prophecy four tells

13:12.210 --> 13:14.248
one strong and honest warrior

13:14.250 --> 13:16.208
who can destroy the oppressive force

13:16.210 --> 13:17.838
known as the Illuminati.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.448
It's leader, Aleister Crowley

13:19.450 --> 13:22.338
and it's overlord Lucifer himself.

13:22.340 --> 13:23.748
And who may that be?

13:23.750 --> 13:25.211
That's you.

13:25.213 --> 13:26.214
Me?

13:26.216 --> 13:27.218
Not interested.

13:27.220 --> 13:29.198
Is that your answer?

13:29.200 --> 13:30.608
Answer to what?

13:30.610 --> 13:32.278
Your destiny is calling.

13:32.280 --> 13:34.291
No one escapes destiny you know.

13:34.293 --> 13:37.008
Well I did it twice.

13:37.010 --> 13:39.228
I escaped a Chinese laboratory

13:39.230 --> 13:41.818
and I escaped from earth.

13:41.820 --> 13:44.528
But you haven't escaped from Mars

13:44.530 --> 13:46.258
and you won't escape the prophecy.

13:46.260 --> 13:48.518
I don't know what you're
trying to do here Queeny

13:48.520 --> 13:50.038
but you got the wrong guy.

13:50.040 --> 13:52.268
We're still at war Donald.

13:52.270 --> 13:55.038
The allied forces are
battling the Illuminati army

13:55.040 --> 13:57.898
in every corner of the universe.

13:57.900 --> 13:59.863
And you can tip the scale.

14:01.020 --> 14:02.359
Me?

14:02.361 --> 14:06.060
I don't give a fuck about
your war or your prophecy.

14:10.630 --> 14:12.474
Commander Comrade.

14:12.476 --> 14:14.153
what is this pressing news

14:14.155 --> 14:16.400
you have for me that cannot wait?

14:16.402 --> 14:20.968
Until after our
ceremony are concluded.

14:20.970 --> 14:23.418
My apologies for interrupting Aleister.

14:23.420 --> 14:27.698
But our radar has detected
unusual surface activity on Mars.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.268
I thought you should know at once.

14:29.270 --> 14:30.500
Surface activities?

14:31.840 --> 14:32.673
On mars?

14:34.023 --> 14:36.578
That's the harshest terrain around.

14:36.580 --> 14:37.953
It's barely inhabitable.

14:41.970 --> 14:44.502
This may be the harbor of destruction

14:44.504 --> 14:46.356
that Anubis warned me of.

14:46.358 --> 14:48.098
Should we move in and check it out?

14:48.100 --> 14:48.933
Yes commander.

14:49.920 --> 14:53.273
Send Anubis armed search
party to set up camp on mars.

14:54.471 --> 14:56.679
Once they've secured the surface

14:56.681 --> 14:59.491
I'll go hunting around for myself.

14:59.493 --> 15:00.324
Will do sir.

15:00.326 --> 15:03.617
The Illuminati is at a
crucial junction commander.

15:04.680 --> 15:08.980
We now tilt at on the edge
of a percussion presimese.

15:09.982 --> 15:11.695
Dispatch the search team

15:11.697 --> 15:15.468
then return to my chambers immediately.

15:15.470 --> 15:18.158
I wish to use this seminar intention

15:18.160 --> 15:22.362
to conclude my sex magic
with you in person.

15:22.364 --> 15:23.558
Yes, Aleister.

15:23.560 --> 15:24.998
I'll be there shortly

15:25.000 --> 15:27.378
and I eagerly await your instruction.

15:27.380 --> 15:30.089
I know you do commander.

15:30.091 --> 15:31.952
I know you do.

15:50.765 --> 15:52.098
Ivanca, Ivanca

15:59.560 --> 16:04.560
another vivid dream, the
sites, the suns, the feelings.

16:04.990 --> 16:08.328
So foreign yet so familiar.

16:08.330 --> 16:10.088
Like a ghostly echo.

16:10.090 --> 16:12.974
The life that once was.

16:14.450 --> 16:16.200
What the hell is that?

16:25.720 --> 16:28.108
I don't really care for this
certain uptake in activity

16:28.110 --> 16:29.458
around here.

16:29.460 --> 16:33.348
When did mars become such
a popular destination?

16:33.350 --> 16:34.928
If it's that Atlantean queen

16:34.930 --> 16:37.818
coming back to pitch me on
joining her fight again.

16:37.820 --> 16:41.003
Maybe I'll just plant a
pick Axe between her eyes.

16:42.480 --> 16:46.258
Our team has landed on Mars
as you instructed Aleister.

16:46.260 --> 16:49.858
Come first light they'll commence
a thorough surface search.

16:49.860 --> 16:51.958
Excellent commander Conrad.

16:51.960 --> 16:54.218
Relay my order that any living beings

16:54.220 --> 16:56.758
are to be executed on site.

16:56.760 --> 17:01.418
Their carcasses bring
back to me to be defiled.

17:01.420 --> 17:05.789
Unless they find one Donald Trump.

17:05.790 --> 17:07.790
Him, I want taken alive.

18:33.047 --> 18:34.977
Update me Commander.

18:34.979 --> 18:37.473
What is the status of
the Mars search team?

18:38.470 --> 18:41.508
Well, I've not been
able to reach the teams.

18:41.510 --> 18:44.020
Since our last transmission Aleister.

18:44.022 --> 18:46.712
You've not been able to reach them?

18:46.714 --> 18:49.100
What kind of an Illuminati

18:49.102 --> 18:52.168
do you think am running here commander?

18:52.170 --> 18:53.536
A strong one.

18:53.538 --> 18:54.728
A mighty one.

18:54.730 --> 18:56.518
A fearsome one

18:56.520 --> 18:58.438
No one in their right mind

18:58.440 --> 19:02.228
wouldn't dare cross the
Illuminati army Aleister.

19:02.230 --> 19:04.198
Maybe it's a technical issue.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.548
Mars is pretty spotty service.

19:06.550 --> 19:08.078
Spotty?

19:08.080 --> 19:11.328
I'll show you the true meaning of spotty.

19:11.330 --> 19:13.821
Those soldiers will understand Solitude

19:13.823 --> 19:16.983
when I frog their greased naked asses.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.115
Ready the star cruiser

19:20.117 --> 19:25.117
and assemble my security detail
commander yourself included.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.413
We are going to mars.

19:32.536 --> 19:34.428
What the fuck's going on around here.

19:34.430 --> 19:35.788
Those soldiers last night

19:35.790 --> 19:39.208
weren't here to steady
insects and collect rocks,

19:39.210 --> 19:40.768
I know that much.

19:40.770 --> 19:42.958
They were clandestine, highly trained

19:42.960 --> 19:45.388
armed to the teeth.

19:45.390 --> 19:46.958
sooner rather than later,

19:46.960 --> 19:50.078
whoever sent those guys is
going to realize they're MIA.

19:50.080 --> 19:53.978
Then my guess is, all hell's
gonna break loose around here.

19:53.980 --> 19:56.073
And I'll be right in the cross hairs.

19:57.170 --> 20:00.048
Maybe queen Varuna is not behind this.

20:00.050 --> 20:02.488
Maybe she was telling the truth

20:02.490 --> 20:05.388
and this God forsaken war is gonna find me

20:05.390 --> 20:08.358
whether I want to fight or not.

20:08.360 --> 20:10.978
She left her contact information.

20:10.980 --> 20:11.943
What could it hurt?

20:12.900 --> 20:14.268
You there Queeny?

20:14.270 --> 20:15.238
Come in.

20:15.240 --> 20:16.974
I'm here DJT.

20:16.976 --> 20:18.268
Call me Trump.

20:18.270 --> 20:19.978
I'm surprised to hear your voice

20:19.980 --> 20:21.768
after the way our last meeting ended.

20:21.770 --> 20:23.468
Is everything all right?

20:23.470 --> 20:25.527
If you call a pile of dead lizard creeps

20:25.529 --> 20:28.143
in a walk in freezer all right.

20:28.980 --> 20:30.806
Illuminati foot soldiers.

20:30.808 --> 20:32.658
Are you still on Mars?

20:32.660 --> 20:35.368
Yeah, but I'm not alone anymore.

20:35.370 --> 20:36.348
They found you.

20:36.350 --> 20:37.588
You've got to be careful.

20:37.590 --> 20:39.958
However many there were, more will follow.

20:39.960 --> 20:43.428
Hey relax sweetheart, here they are now.

20:43.430 --> 20:44.835
What, where?

20:44.837 --> 20:45.908
Are you captured?

20:45.910 --> 20:49.438
No, but seems
every time I try to get out.

20:49.440 --> 20:51.563
Some asshole pulls me back in.

20:52.450 --> 20:53.300
I'll work it out.

20:54.770 --> 20:57.008
I'll notify
allied command right away.

20:57.010 --> 20:58.658
Stay strong Trump.

20:58.660 --> 21:00.713
Remember we've got your back.

21:01.950 --> 21:02.783
Trump?

21:03.660 --> 21:04.493
Trump?

21:13.290 --> 21:15.553
Who might this orange rat be.

21:19.640 --> 21:23.058
You're on my
turf rant You tell me.

21:23.060 --> 21:24.175
Who?

21:24.177 --> 21:27.688
But I asked you first
and we make the rules.

21:27.690 --> 21:29.558
What gives you that impression?

21:29.560 --> 21:31.958
Look at the optics out layer.

21:31.960 --> 21:33.518
We've got the guns

21:33.520 --> 21:35.338
and we've got the numbers.

21:35.340 --> 21:36.328
Well, I've got the money.

21:36.330 --> 21:37.208
Money?

21:37.210 --> 21:38.908
You don't think I'd just be sitting here

21:38.910 --> 21:43.089
all by myself on mars with
my dick in my hands do you?

21:43.091 --> 21:45.358
Well tell me more,

21:45.360 --> 21:48.518
or better yet, Show me cocks man

21:48.520 --> 21:51.018
10 million
Japanese yen for the taking.

21:51.020 --> 21:54.978
One of those storage cars
over there is full of cash.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.063
That's right and you can have half.

21:57.970 --> 22:02.970
How generous
but out of curiosity,

22:03.270 --> 22:05.558
what would serve us from just killing you

22:05.560 --> 22:07.118
and taking it all.

22:07.120 --> 22:11.468
Not so fast TT,
curiosity killed the cat.

22:11.470 --> 22:14.838
The other car's rigged
with enough explosive to

22:14.840 --> 22:18.428
boom obliterate us in the blink of an eye

22:18.430 --> 22:21.208
and turn mars into Stardust.

22:21.210 --> 22:24.098
I'll take the deal, that's
why you're here right?

22:24.100 --> 22:25.638
Wrong.

22:25.640 --> 22:27.208
We're here for you.

22:27.210 --> 22:30.888
Because you are the one aiming
to destroy the illuminati.

22:30.890 --> 22:34.098
Isn't that right Donald J. Trump.

22:34.100 --> 22:36.118
No, just cloned.

22:36.120 --> 22:37.435
Well I don't care if you are the first

22:37.437 --> 22:41.673
or the 15th generation,
you are coming with us.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.983
Turn around and raise your hands.

22:46.010 --> 22:47.163
If you insist.

22:48.010 --> 22:50.803
Computer play Trump's favorite playlist.

23:30.720 --> 23:34.248
Pot, Halo Put a vessel on
standby and beam Trump up.

23:34.250 --> 23:36.668
I've never seen a shit star like this guy.

23:36.670 --> 23:38.138
Right away Queen Varuna.

23:38.140 --> 23:41.108
The Vanguard one is ready to fly queen.

23:41.110 --> 23:42.718
We must save him.

23:42.720 --> 23:44.648
This may be our last and only chance

23:44.650 --> 23:46.173
to set the prophecy in motion.

23:47.370 --> 23:50.038
The particle regeneration
transporter has a lock on Trump.

23:50.040 --> 23:51.040
Here goes nothing.

23:59.690 --> 24:01.968
How do you feel Trump?

24:01.970 --> 24:04.218
Tingly, what the fuck just happened?

24:04.220 --> 24:05.408
We've materialized you.

24:05.410 --> 24:07.598
In your very own spaceship

24:07.600 --> 24:11.388
and it's Illuminati issue to be incognito.

24:11.390 --> 24:12.988
Welcome to the war.

24:12.990 --> 24:15.598
Sounds like I just got a raw deal.

24:15.600 --> 24:18.208
Is it too late to tell
you to go fuck yourself?

24:18.210 --> 24:19.848
Way too late.

24:19.850 --> 24:22.338
The prophecy I told you about is real

24:22.340 --> 24:24.023
and it's now in motion.

24:25.204 --> 24:27.314
So what do we do now?

24:27.316 --> 24:29.398
Now you go to hell.

24:29.400 --> 24:30.608
Fuck you bitch.

24:30.610 --> 24:31.958
Listen Trump.

24:31.960 --> 24:34.638
The prophecy States, you must
travel all the way to hell

24:34.640 --> 24:37.454
to face Lucifer and
destroy the Illuminati.

24:37.456 --> 24:39.268
That's long trip.

24:39.270 --> 24:40.618
Who's footing the bill?

24:40.620 --> 24:42.468
The good guys of course.

24:42.470 --> 24:44.708
Anything you need will
be provided by the allies

24:44.710 --> 24:45.848
without question.

24:45.850 --> 24:48.098
How about a fifth of whiskey and a Cuban.

24:48.100 --> 24:50.233
No, the booze is no problem.

24:50.235 --> 24:55.235
As for the Cuban, do you
mean a cigar or a sidekick?

24:55.330 --> 24:57.638
A cigar, unless your
sidekick can deliver

24:57.640 --> 24:59.098
your head on a stick.

24:59.100 --> 25:00.238
Stogy it is.

25:00.240 --> 25:03.313
When I get back, I'm going to kill you.

25:03.315 --> 25:04.765
Lucifer's waiting.

25:05.930 --> 25:08.108
Dig this new technology.

25:08.110 --> 25:11.178
They didn't make him like
this when I was on earth.

25:11.180 --> 25:12.430
What does this button do?

25:15.830 --> 25:17.053
It's been a while.

25:19.450 --> 25:22.171
This ships a fine piece
of hardware for sure.

25:22.173 --> 25:24.818
More like tasting a smooth eyeball

25:24.820 --> 25:26.558
while tickling the ivories.

25:26.560 --> 25:29.508
With a leggy dame in a red slit dress

25:29.510 --> 25:32.638
stretched out on top
of the mahogany grand.

25:32.640 --> 25:35.408
But it might be even finer
to turn this cruiser around

25:35.410 --> 25:38.908
and fly off to the grivation nebula

25:38.910 --> 25:41.218
live happily ever after.

25:41.220 --> 25:43.958
which in my case is for fucking ever,

25:43.960 --> 25:46.425
even paradise would get dull.

25:46.427 --> 25:48.988
Fuck it I love a good fight.

25:48.990 --> 25:51.978
Let's see what this prophecy
businesses is all about.

25:51.980 --> 25:54.983
Hell you ain't see nothing yet.

26:02.690 --> 26:05.158
You mean to tell
me, Donald Trump is alive.

26:05.160 --> 26:07.153
Not exactly princess Carney.

26:08.010 --> 26:11.468
However, the Chinese clone
of Trump is alive and well.

26:11.470 --> 26:15.088
And through him, the prophecy
can still be realized.

26:15.090 --> 26:17.308
This is the best news we've received,

26:17.310 --> 26:20.008
since the Illuminati fled
the Milky way to regroup

26:20.010 --> 26:23.903
after losing the battle
of the beyond in 2457.

26:23.905 --> 26:25.508
I agree princess.

26:25.510 --> 26:28.278
This could very well signal
the turning of the tide.

26:28.280 --> 26:29.458
I'm sending my best man,

26:29.460 --> 26:31.558
Jack van Helsing to backup Trump.

26:31.560 --> 26:34.038
Whatever he needs, we'll be there.

26:34.040 --> 26:37.368
Varuna this could finally
seal victory for the allies

26:37.370 --> 26:40.248
and ensure the survival of the human race.

26:40.250 --> 26:42.323
God willing princess, it will.

26:53.670 --> 26:54.998
I wanna talk to you.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.288
We've been over this.

26:56.290 --> 26:57.368
Over what?

26:57.370 --> 27:00.048
I can't keep it in
my pants is what you said.

27:00.050 --> 27:01.378
Was I wrong?

27:01.380 --> 27:02.488
Are you flirting?

27:02.490 --> 27:03.321
No.

27:03.323 --> 27:04.358
Then we won't know will we?

27:04.360 --> 27:05.618
I need you.

27:05.620 --> 27:06.788
For a mission that is.

27:06.790 --> 27:08.748
You got me hard for a second there.

27:08.750 --> 27:10.668
I'm sure One of dr. Jekyll's nurses

27:10.670 --> 27:12.178
can take care of it for you.

27:12.180 --> 27:14.228
No thanks they're needle happy.

27:14.230 --> 27:15.398
That's their job.

27:15.400 --> 27:16.968
You have one too.

27:16.970 --> 27:19.508
It would be nice if you
focused on it more often,

27:19.510 --> 27:20.728
What do you need Carney?

27:20.730 --> 27:22.308
Trump is in the cosmos.

27:22.310 --> 27:24.958
If we can see the way that
he gets safe passage to hell,

27:24.960 --> 27:26.868
the prophecy can be fulfilled.

27:26.870 --> 27:27.708
Trump?

27:27.710 --> 27:29.288
You mean the Donald?

27:29.290 --> 27:30.121
But I thought

27:30.123 --> 27:31.178
Donald V2.

27:31.180 --> 27:32.558
He's a Chinese lab clone

27:32.560 --> 27:36.348
with the same drive spirit
and will as the Donald.

27:36.350 --> 27:38.298
He's been hiding out on Mars.

27:38.300 --> 27:40.298
Now he's ready to go to hell.

27:40.300 --> 27:41.918
Sounds like a bad deal to me.

27:41.920 --> 27:43.258
That's not your call.

27:43.260 --> 27:46.488
Trump's flying under the radar
in an Illuminati cruiser.

27:46.490 --> 27:48.848
Your ship is fueled and ready.

27:48.850 --> 27:51.218
Rendezvous with him and run interference.

27:51.220 --> 27:53.468
Keep him safe at all costs.

27:53.470 --> 27:54.878
Is this a suicide mission?

27:54.880 --> 27:57.168
Make it Whatever you want it to be VH.

27:57.170 --> 27:58.898
just clean up and blast off.

27:58.900 --> 28:01.058
I prefer to blast off than clean up.

28:01.060 --> 28:02.728
Your vessels in dock four.

28:02.730 --> 28:05.628
How about I parked my vessel
in your dock when I get back?

28:05.630 --> 28:07.543
Leave, as soon as you're ready.

28:08.670 --> 28:11.158
I love it when you talk dirty.

28:11.160 --> 28:13.608
Leave as soon as you're ready.

28:13.610 --> 28:15.858
This perpetual war is getting old.

28:15.860 --> 28:18.093
How much longer can this last anyway?

28:19.230 --> 28:20.988
The Illuminati been gunning for our heads

28:20.990 --> 28:22.818
ever since I can remember.

28:22.820 --> 28:24.583
And I'm a fucking clone myself.

28:25.480 --> 28:26.588
I wonder if the original

28:26.590 --> 28:28.623
Jack van Helsing dealt with this shit.

28:30.610 --> 28:32.778
Mars sounds like a good option to me.

28:32.780 --> 28:34.118
Little peace and quiet.

28:34.120 --> 28:34.951
Shouldn't be too hard

28:34.953 --> 28:36.838
to keep the surface crawlers at Bay.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.113
Bug light or a tiki
torch will do the trick.

28:40.510 --> 28:43.718
Maybe I can interest
Trump in trading places.

28:43.720 --> 28:45.778
They could fill my spot in the allied army

28:45.780 --> 28:48.478
and I could ease into
retirement on the red planet.

28:48.480 --> 28:51.028
I bet he's got sweet digs out there.

28:51.030 --> 28:53.038
The soldier life is getting old.

28:53.040 --> 28:55.475
I can't believe I made it this far.

29:25.670 --> 29:28.278
That day almost ended
everything for the allies

29:28.280 --> 29:30.378
and the trapped.

29:30.380 --> 29:32.898
I'm still not sure who
got the better of it.

29:32.900 --> 29:35.368
Our top command or unit was decimated.

29:35.370 --> 29:37.733
The Traps came real
close to being wiped out.

29:38.590 --> 29:41.968
None of us can afford to get
that close to the abyss again.

29:41.970 --> 29:45.768
In this game, the price
of the fetus extinction.

29:45.770 --> 29:47.498
VH report
to dock four for duty.

29:47.500 --> 29:50.318
I repeat report to dock for duty.

29:50.320 --> 29:52.183
I heard you the first time doll.

29:53.360 --> 29:54.928
Did you see what that son of a bitch

29:54.930 --> 29:57.068
did on mars commander Comrade?

29:57.070 --> 30:01.018
Clones just can't beam
themselves up like that Aleister.

30:01.020 --> 30:02.068
He had help.

30:02.070 --> 30:05.171
Yes, well, he's going
to need a lot more of it.

30:05.173 --> 30:08.588
Am implementing a full
scale search and destroy

30:08.590 --> 30:10.363
for Donald Trump.

30:11.630 --> 30:16.285
And any allies who gets in
our way in the slightest,

30:16.287 --> 30:18.958
are to be terminate on site.

30:18.960 --> 30:22.478
Ten four we'll find
him in no time Aleister.

30:22.480 --> 30:26.108
He's not only got the most
hated face in the universe.

30:26.110 --> 30:27.588
He's got the ugliest.

30:27.590 --> 30:29.098
stand on just.

30:29.100 --> 30:32.968
That's right, the bastard
can't hide anywhere for long.

30:32.970 --> 30:36.268
We'll have his hide
skinned any minute now.

30:36.270 --> 30:38.928
And we won't have to
worry about tanning it.

30:38.930 --> 30:40.588
That's what I like to hear.

30:40.590 --> 30:45.590
Tell me, commander, have you
ever consumed human flesh?

30:45.780 --> 30:50.518
I mean, choice cuts seasoned
and roasted to perfection.

30:50.520 --> 30:51.353
I have not.

30:53.490 --> 30:56.968
You are in for
such a delectable treat.

30:56.970 --> 30:59.078
Am glad to see
you finally took flight VH.

30:59.080 --> 31:01.978
I was the beginning to think
you were getting cold feet.

31:01.980 --> 31:03.908
I had to use the bathroom princess.

31:03.910 --> 31:04.958
Fair enough.

31:04.960 --> 31:06.568
Watch your back out there.

31:06.570 --> 31:09.758
I'd like to remind you
that the stakes are high.

31:09.760 --> 31:11.238
Aren't they always?

31:11.240 --> 31:13.558
Not like this, with Trump in the fray,

31:13.560 --> 31:16.118
we stand a real chance of winning this war

31:16.120 --> 31:19.188
and ushering in an era of peace.

31:19.190 --> 31:21.138
The rest of us fight tooth and nail

31:21.140 --> 31:23.118
for any small victory we can achieve,

31:23.120 --> 31:25.618
but Trump's different.

31:25.620 --> 31:26.451
He's prophesied.

31:26.453 --> 31:28.521
Let's just hope it
turns out better for him

31:28.523 --> 31:30.748
than it did for the original Donald?

31:30.750 --> 31:33.038
That's why you're in the game VH.

31:33.040 --> 31:36.258
Just remember to keep it in
your pants out there all right?

31:36.260 --> 31:38.648
I'll be fine I'm flying commando.

31:38.650 --> 31:41.048
Good, sometimes you don't even do that.

31:41.050 --> 31:43.078
I want you to stay focused.

31:43.080 --> 31:45.128
Your goal is to locate the new head of the

31:45.130 --> 31:47.648
Illuminati forces, Aleister Crowley.

31:47.650 --> 31:49.794
and bring him in alive.

31:49.796 --> 31:50.998
Alive?

31:51.000 --> 31:51.898
What fun is that?

31:51.900 --> 31:54.043
Just do as I say soldier.

31:55.750 --> 31:58.948
Since the dawn of this
good versus evil conflict,

31:58.950 --> 32:01.138
we've wiped out enough Illuminati leaders

32:01.140 --> 32:02.508
to fill a moon graveyard,

32:02.510 --> 32:05.618
but they always grow a new head.

32:05.620 --> 32:08.208
Someone always steps
up to take their place

32:08.210 --> 32:09.833
and keep waging war.

32:10.780 --> 32:12.878
This time we're gonna subvert

32:12.880 --> 32:15.278
the Illuminati cause from within.

32:15.280 --> 32:16.588
What are we talking about?

32:16.590 --> 32:19.488
A little something Dr.
Jekyll's been working on

32:19.490 --> 32:22.668
an experimental serum that
can reverse ideologies

32:22.670 --> 32:25.166
and scramble intentions.

32:25.168 --> 32:27.488
Hell a fifth of bourbon will do that.

32:27.490 --> 32:29.558
You find Crowley,
bring him to headquarters

32:29.560 --> 32:32.218
and he'll be our first test subject.

32:32.220 --> 32:35.448
If we can get him to order
his evil forces to stand down

32:35.450 --> 32:39.348
and Trump makes it to hell
to realize the prophecy.

32:39.350 --> 32:42.868
This endless war will at last be won.

32:42.870 --> 32:44.508
I bet I'll get lucky then?

32:44.510 --> 32:46.678
Help me bring peace
to the universe soldier

32:46.680 --> 32:49.568
and I'll give you anything you want.

32:49.570 --> 32:51.028
That's all you had to say doll.

32:51.030 --> 32:53.288
Be careful, I want you under the radar

32:53.290 --> 32:55.038
so you won't have backup on this one.

32:55.040 --> 32:55.918
That's all right.

32:55.920 --> 32:58.408
I have a little insurance
policy I can call on,

32:58.410 --> 33:00.978
In times just like this.

33:00.980 --> 33:04.288
Well, Mr. Trump,
I'll admit, I'm a bit surprised

33:04.290 --> 33:07.188
you haven't turned your
ship around 180 degrees

33:07.190 --> 33:09.263
and flown off to the Nebula.

33:09.265 --> 33:10.178
I thought about it.

33:10.180 --> 33:12.048
I'm sure you did.

33:12.050 --> 33:13.618
Just know this.

33:13.620 --> 33:17.378
The prophecy is more important
than the life of a clone.

33:17.380 --> 33:19.638
You occupy a very special place

33:19.640 --> 33:21.638
in the history of our universe.

33:21.640 --> 33:23.718
Far more special than your predecessor

33:23.720 --> 33:26.508
who only achieved the 45th presidency

33:26.510 --> 33:28.608
of earths United States.

33:28.610 --> 33:30.878
What a splash that asshole made.

33:30.880 --> 33:35.118
Indeed, so imagine the
splash you'll make in contrast.

33:35.120 --> 33:37.198
Whereas he was a despised villain.

33:37.200 --> 33:39.228
You'll be a beloved hero.

33:39.230 --> 33:40.893
Well since you put it that way?

33:40.895 --> 33:44.848
Just like my name sake I
do what I say I'm gonna do.

33:44.850 --> 33:47.378
I get the job done Queeny,

33:47.380 --> 33:51.438
and no illuminati soldier
alive can stop me.

33:51.440 --> 33:53.458
Delightful Mr. Trump.

33:53.460 --> 33:55.253
Now let's go to war.

33:57.054 --> 33:59.065
My wicked Crowley?

33:59.067 --> 34:00.763
Yes, Lucifer.

34:03.860 --> 34:07.928
Speak to me oh mighty beast.

34:07.930 --> 34:11.643
And your will shall be done
through my loyal hands.

34:12.489 --> 34:16.197
This is to know when the time comes

34:16.199 --> 34:19.188
I shall mobilize all the universe dammed

34:19.190 --> 34:23.158
for an attack unlike any
the allies have ever faced,

34:23.159 --> 34:24.748
non will be spared.

34:24.750 --> 34:28.257
The hearts and livers of the
hollies shall be spit roasted

34:28.260 --> 34:31.693
in the raging flames of
hell for all eternity.

34:33.268 --> 34:36.053
Let it be known oh mighty lucifer.

34:37.380 --> 34:41.518
That I am forever in your service.

34:41.520 --> 34:45.672
This people and their God are fools.

34:46.973 --> 34:51.237
And like fools they will
be driven before you

34:51.239 --> 34:54.068
at the time of your choosing.

34:54.070 --> 34:58.445
This I do solemnly vow.

34:58.447 --> 35:01.598
Go my son, go and spread hell fire

35:01.600 --> 35:06.128
and in turn your place in
hell will be at my feet.

35:06.130 --> 35:09.528
And what big feet you have my lord.

35:09.530 --> 35:12.648
In the blasphemous Bible's own words.

35:12.650 --> 35:15.708
how at thou fallen from heave, oh Lucifer,

35:15.710 --> 35:17.488
son of the morning.

35:17.490 --> 35:19.978
How at thou cut down to the ground,

35:19.980 --> 35:22.238
which dis weakens the nations.

35:22.240 --> 35:26.833
And now, one would we now march, onward.

35:26.835 --> 35:28.752
Into glorious oblivion.

35:32.230 --> 35:35.078
It looks like I
missed a hell of a good time.

35:35.080 --> 35:37.330
Bigfoot always did know
how to throw a party.

35:38.220 --> 35:39.718
guess I should come to the debris,

35:39.720 --> 35:42.158
see if he's plastered someplace.

35:42.160 --> 35:44.248
He might need to be
rolled over on his side.

35:44.250 --> 35:47.443
Puke asphyxiation is no
way for a Sasquatch to go.

35:49.592 --> 35:50.858
Van Helsing

35:50.860 --> 35:52.908
Long time no see old buddy.

35:52.910 --> 35:53.768
How's it hanging?

35:53.770 --> 35:57.098
To the left as always.
I'd offer you a drink

35:57.100 --> 35:59.248
but all is left all is left are empties.

35:59.250 --> 36:00.538
Stylishly lead to one thing,

36:00.540 --> 36:02.978
but you missed the bash entirely.

36:02.980 --> 36:06.158
My bad foot, but, I
didn't come to party.

36:06.160 --> 36:07.298
No?

36:07.300 --> 36:08.568
Why then my dude.

36:08.570 --> 36:09.898
I'm on a mission,

36:09.900 --> 36:11.798
and I could use a bruiser for backup.

36:11.800 --> 36:14.098
Bloodshed and mayhem?

36:14.100 --> 36:15.753
Fuck yeah, I'm in.

36:16.790 --> 36:19.601
I was hoping you'd
say that, let's rumble.

36:20.436 --> 36:22.448
When you said let's rumble,

36:22.450 --> 36:24.468
I didn't think navigating the meteor field

36:24.470 --> 36:26.018
is what you meant the VH.

36:26.020 --> 36:28.098
Relax buddy, I know what I'm doing.

36:28.100 --> 36:29.078
Good to know.

36:29.080 --> 36:31.388
Cause a navigational
error of one millimeter

36:31.390 --> 36:33.548
will implode us in the blink of an eye.

36:33.550 --> 36:35.631
Listen to you,
with the big words.

36:35.633 --> 36:38.188
Somebody has been reading
the dictionary I sent.

36:38.190 --> 36:39.478
What can I say?

36:39.480 --> 36:42.235
brute force and big cox used
to be the name of the game,

36:42.237 --> 36:45.608
but these days, chicks
dig a smart Sasquatch.

36:45.610 --> 36:48.908
Well, all right, next
time I'll send a thesaurus.

36:48.910 --> 36:50.218
Okay, so check it out.

36:50.220 --> 36:52.158
We're sneaking through this meteor shower,

36:52.160 --> 36:53.198
because the electromagnetic

36:53.200 --> 36:55.468
pulses through off radar detection.

36:55.470 --> 36:57.138
We're going to surprise Aleister Crowley,

36:57.140 --> 36:58.488
aboard his own vessel,

36:58.490 --> 37:01.168
right under the noses
of his Illuminati army,

37:01.170 --> 37:02.518
and take him into custody.

37:02.520 --> 37:04.458
Why don't we just
smash his fucking head in

37:04.460 --> 37:07.388
like a rock melon on the
floor, and be done with it.

37:07.390 --> 37:08.745
Trust me, I'd like to,

37:08.747 --> 37:11.788
but I have orders to
apprehend, not terminate.

37:11.790 --> 37:13.948
Okay sitter, sitter.

37:13.950 --> 37:17.688
There it is, Illuminati
headquarters is on our screens.

37:17.690 --> 37:19.653
Keep us on course while I hop aboard.

38:06.600 --> 38:09.948
Come on, come on, what
the hell is taking so long.

38:09.950 --> 38:13.195
Those Illuminati punks are like all doves.

38:40.230 --> 38:41.758
Sorry about the delay foot,

38:41.760 --> 38:44.528
ran into a little snag,
but I took care of it.

38:44.530 --> 38:46.178
If you want to come have some fun,

38:46.180 --> 38:48.398
the loading entrance of
the lower orbital segment

38:48.400 --> 38:49.558
is all clear.

38:49.560 --> 38:51.798
I'm approaching the
ship's command center now.

38:51.800 --> 38:54.621
Sounds fun, I'm on my way.

38:54.623 --> 38:58.328
How did the meeting with
Emperor Lucifer go Aleister.

38:58.330 --> 39:00.198
It went smashingly commander.

39:00.200 --> 39:02.764
Under our Lord's rule,

39:02.766 --> 39:06.828
the glorious new dawn
will soon be upon us.

39:06.830 --> 39:09.998
Like a savage dock steed mounting a fairer

39:10.000 --> 39:12.618
and supple maiden in the deep woods,

39:12.620 --> 39:17.620
where no one can see her
ravaged, or hear her screams.

39:17.870 --> 39:19.583
Such a way with words.

39:21.111 --> 39:22.258
Who's there?

39:22.260 --> 39:23.550
Time's up Crowley.

39:23.552 --> 39:27.878
How the hell did two
allied breach my security?

39:27.880 --> 39:29.158
It wasn't difficult Crowley,

39:29.160 --> 39:31.558
In fact, I did it all by myself.

39:31.560 --> 39:33.628
You ought to hired better help than him.

39:33.630 --> 39:35.030
Kiss my ass Niederthor

39:36.050 --> 39:37.138
No need for that,

39:37.140 --> 39:39.588
you're on your way to the
allied headquarters where?

39:39.590 --> 39:40.978
If you know what's good for you,

39:40.980 --> 39:43.248
you'll do exactly as you're told.

39:43.250 --> 39:45.428
Your ass belongs to us now, Crowley.

39:45.430 --> 39:49.079
Well, threatened me
with a good time stud.

39:51.300 --> 39:53.288
Sounds like they just realized

39:53.290 --> 39:55.328
their leader is gone VH.

39:55.330 --> 39:57.228
They'll be on our tales.

39:57.230 --> 39:58.178
Let them come.

39:58.180 --> 40:00.878
We'll be back behind
meteor cover in seconds.

40:00.880 --> 40:02.930
I'm going to tell princess the good news.

40:09.550 --> 40:11.908
Good news princess, we got them.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.778
Crowley's in our cargo hold.

40:13.780 --> 40:15.998
The Illuminati snake is headless.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.321
Oh, that's great news VH.

40:17.323 --> 40:21.608
The celebrations in order,
but the job's not done yet.

40:21.610 --> 40:24.008
First get back here, safe and sound.

40:24.010 --> 40:25.568
On my way, sweetheart.

40:25.570 --> 40:27.898
I can't remember the last
time you called me that.

40:27.900 --> 40:29.298
Well, get used to it,

40:29.300 --> 40:30.678
going on another solo mission

40:30.680 --> 40:32.930
makes me remember how
special you are Carney.

40:33.915 --> 40:34.746
Really?

40:34.748 --> 40:35.579
Really?

40:35.581 --> 40:37.311
And you work it till I
ache when you're on top.

40:37.313 --> 40:38.228
I know.

40:38.230 --> 40:40.488
Still humble as ever I see.

40:40.490 --> 40:41.543
Tell me about it.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.053
And here it is
Illuminati headquarters.

40:47.790 --> 40:52.548
Like a flying hornet's nest,
some bad evil people in there.

40:52.550 --> 40:55.028
Real horrible low lives.

40:55.030 --> 40:58.008
This is my chance to
show the universe that,

40:58.010 --> 41:00.908
even after a thousand plus years,

41:00.910 --> 41:04.398
Trump-mania still alive and kicking.

41:04.400 --> 41:06.608
Get ready to bite at you scum,

41:06.610 --> 41:07.913
here I come.

41:10.010 --> 41:12.793
Suck on that, you corrupt creeps.

41:21.950 --> 41:23.058
Cheers Queeny.

41:23.060 --> 41:25.768
You know, I can use an ally
If you could spare one.

41:25.770 --> 41:28.608
You need only ask Trump, stay strong.

41:28.610 --> 41:30.723
My Atlantean forces are on the way.

41:36.960 --> 41:39.683
Well, my job's done
here, it's break time.

41:40.930 --> 41:44.038
Allied HQ has the best
galley in outer space,

41:44.040 --> 41:46.283
their fridge is always stocked.

41:47.876 --> 41:52.128
I smell roast beef, potato salad, lasagna,

41:52.130 --> 41:54.438
I can't wait to sink my teeth in.

41:54.440 --> 41:57.368
Welcome to
allied headquarters Crowley,

41:57.370 --> 41:59.928
I'd trust the trust the
handcuffs weren't too tight.

41:59.930 --> 42:03.248
Maybe I enjoy myself
when they're tight cunt.

42:03.250 --> 42:04.918
Watch your mouth you little shit,

42:04.920 --> 42:06.513
or I'll fill it with my fist.

42:07.593 --> 42:11.568
Teasing fun again, bring it on stud.

42:11.570 --> 42:13.474
I'll cut
to the chase Aleister.

42:13.476 --> 42:16.698
the injection, Dr. Jekyll
administered when you arrived,

42:16.700 --> 42:18.863
should be taking effect any minute.

42:19.700 --> 42:22.168
Your job is simple.

42:22.170 --> 42:26.248
Renounced the Illuminati
and all its nefarious goals,

42:26.250 --> 42:31.206
and order your army to
stand down, immediately.

42:31.208 --> 42:34.328
Sounds like you need
me to play along harlot.

42:34.330 --> 42:35.908
Why should I help you?

42:35.910 --> 42:38.278
Because you have no choice.

42:38.280 --> 42:40.548
The serum coursing through your veins

42:40.550 --> 42:42.487
is an experimental mood drug,

42:42.489 --> 42:46.358
designed to make you wholly
and mean able to suggestion.

42:46.360 --> 42:48.218
No matter how out of character

42:48.220 --> 42:51.032
for your natural inclinations.

42:51.034 --> 42:52.648
Boil it down bitch.

42:52.650 --> 42:54.505
One more insult, and I'll
hand you your teeth you little..

42:54.507 --> 42:55.958
Do, as I say quickly,

42:55.960 --> 42:58.798
because you'll do as I say regardless,

42:58.800 --> 43:01.258
then we can rush you back to Jekyll's lab

43:01.260 --> 43:04.247
and he'll inject you
with a serum antidote.

43:04.249 --> 43:07.666
Antidote, why would I need an antidote?

43:08.730 --> 43:11.658
The drug is highly experimental.

43:11.660 --> 43:14.628
So experimental, in
fact that we don't know

43:14.630 --> 43:17.428
it's short term effects on the system.

43:17.430 --> 43:18.958
A large dose will make you say

43:18.960 --> 43:22.718
whatever an engineer
wants you to say verbatim.

43:22.720 --> 43:26.238
But, as it cycles through your body,

43:26.240 --> 43:28.513
it may result in sudden death.

43:31.044 --> 43:33.127
You think I fear death?

43:34.273 --> 43:38.578
I am death, unite me
with my master, Lucifer,

43:38.580 --> 43:41.998
and I will return thrice as powerful.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.450
Well, this could go better.

43:44.930 --> 43:47.628
Princess Carney Trump is right outside

43:47.630 --> 43:50.738
Illuminati headquarters about
to fulfill the prophecy,

43:50.740 --> 43:53.473
but he's under heavy fire
and needs assistance.

43:54.680 --> 43:58.668
Did you shit heads really
think it would be so easy?

43:58.670 --> 44:01.148
It was easy enough to nab you fuck face.

44:01.150 --> 44:02.738
Send the coordinates and all deploy our

44:02.740 --> 44:04.718
fighter fleet at once Varuna.

44:04.720 --> 44:06.416
We're on our way.

44:06.418 --> 44:07.970
Open wide cocksuckers.

44:10.610 --> 44:12.348
Hello, Mr. Trump.

44:12.350 --> 44:14.548
I'm princess Carney Divine,

44:14.550 --> 44:17.168
leader of the intergalactic allied forces.

44:17.170 --> 44:19.448
Well hello there young lady.

44:19.450 --> 44:22.818
I'm calling to tell you,
my fighters are on their way.

44:22.820 --> 44:25.156
You have our full support.

44:25.158 --> 44:28.848
Tremendous, see, you look like you have

44:28.850 --> 44:31.298
a badging body under that suit.

44:31.300 --> 44:33.763
How about lunch when this is all over?

44:35.190 --> 44:37.123
I'm joining the fight Carney.

44:37.125 --> 44:38.768
The Atlantean army is behind me

44:38.770 --> 44:40.668
and we are willing to fight to the death.

44:40.670 --> 44:44.010
We'll make sure you don't
have to, thank you Varuna.

44:53.780 --> 44:56.508
Attention, Illuminati army.

44:56.510 --> 45:00.318
This is princess Carney
of the allied forces.

45:00.320 --> 45:04.268
You're surrounded. Your
command has surrendered.

45:04.270 --> 45:07.623
You've nowhere to run,
and nowhere to hide,

45:08.530 --> 45:11.078
Give up peacefully and be spared,

45:11.080 --> 45:14.713
or choose to fight and be
blasted straight to hell.

45:16.580 --> 45:19.758
Is that supposed to be a deterrent?

45:19.760 --> 45:24.760
Slut hell is home to the Illuminati.

45:24.860 --> 45:27.458
We bask in it's firely glow,

45:27.460 --> 45:30.428
warm our toes in it's red hot embers.

45:30.430 --> 45:32.988
I'll leave the deterring to you Crowley,

45:32.990 --> 45:35.638
it's time for you to address your army.

45:35.640 --> 45:37.273
You know the talking points.

45:38.550 --> 45:40.704
I seem to have forgotten,

45:40.706 --> 45:44.313
seems your mad doctor isn't
all he is cracked up to be.

45:45.451 --> 45:47.059
I think I'll take a nap.

45:47.061 --> 45:49.178
Let's just beat it out of him.

45:49.180 --> 45:52.238
Forget it the VH, we gave him a chance.

45:52.240 --> 45:54.153
Let the drug stop his heart.

45:55.980 --> 45:59.148
Meet me in the command center,
it's time to finish this.

45:59.150 --> 46:00.738
I love a good climax.

46:00.740 --> 46:03.828
I know I'll make sure
you have another one

46:03.830 --> 46:05.798
when this is all over.

46:05.800 --> 46:10.303
You little slut,
you're my kind of woman.

46:11.287 --> 46:12.578
Room for a third?

46:12.580 --> 46:14.298
Fuck off sleaze.

46:14.300 --> 46:17.403
Dirty talk will get you everywhere stud.

46:18.760 --> 46:21.633
But, best attend to the task at hand.

46:23.150 --> 46:26.168
Mark now the words of the beast,

46:26.170 --> 46:29.393
my minions will not go quietly.

46:36.230 --> 46:38.298
Damn it,
that was a direct hit,

46:38.300 --> 46:40.113
we can't absorb too many of those.

46:43.650 --> 46:46.693
Look, the Atlantean
are here, just in time.

46:48.640 --> 46:50.018
We've got
to keep the bastards

46:50.020 --> 46:51.088
off Trump's back,

46:51.090 --> 46:53.948
so he can get to hell
and realize the prophecy.

46:53.950 --> 46:56.748
Got it, how does
one go to hell anyway?

46:56.750 --> 46:59.338
The gateway is
on our old home planet earth.

46:59.340 --> 47:00.543
Of course it is.

47:01.540 --> 47:04.560
Listen Trump, the gateway
to hell is on earth.

47:17.683 --> 47:21.808
listen, my name is a spotty
track record that I guy is,

47:21.810 --> 47:26.228
it's mired in lawsuits, bad
deals, false accusations,

47:26.230 --> 47:29.890
smear tactics, and threats of all kinds.

47:31.903 --> 47:35.718
Well from one clone to another,
life is what we do today.

47:35.720 --> 47:36.795
He's right Trump,

47:36.797 --> 47:39.598
And the earth is a shell
of its former self,

47:39.600 --> 47:43.968
nothing but a wasteland of
crumbling, smoldering artifacts,

47:43.970 --> 47:45.768
with the exception of Dubai.

47:45.770 --> 47:46.898
Dubai?

47:46.900 --> 47:48.578
Why was Dubai spared?

47:48.580 --> 47:50.093
Its the entrance to hell?

47:51.500 --> 47:53.000
That explains a lot.

47:58.521 --> 48:00.908
It looks so tranquil from up here,

48:00.910 --> 48:02.908
you'd never guessed it
was a wasteland portal

48:02.910 --> 48:04.058
to the underworld.

48:04.060 --> 48:08.058
Something about this view
seems unsettlingly familiar.

48:08.060 --> 48:10.148
Like I've done this before.

48:10.150 --> 48:12.458
Starting in 1949,

48:12.460 --> 48:15.125
top secret international
labs transported human being

48:15.127 --> 48:17.038
out to space and back.

48:17.040 --> 48:20.783
Far more than was reported,
far more than anyone ever knew.

48:21.670 --> 48:26.353
Whether for purposes suspected
or unknown doesn't matter.

48:27.700 --> 48:30.211
By the time the USSR launched Yuri Gagarin

48:30.213 --> 48:33.218
into orbit in 1961,

48:33.220 --> 48:36.758
dozens of human guinea pigs
had already been sent up.

48:36.760 --> 48:41.760
Some never returned, some did,
and wished they that hadn't.

48:42.580 --> 48:45.008
Trace DNA from these experiments,

48:45.010 --> 48:47.368
still exists in many people.

48:47.370 --> 48:50.108
Silent biological time bombs,

48:50.110 --> 48:52.378
passed down through generations,

48:52.380 --> 48:56.942
but even more for those of
us conceive in a Petri dish.

48:56.944 --> 48:58.068
I've always wondered

48:58.070 --> 49:01.718
if Major Tom was a result of this stuff.

49:01.720 --> 49:05.068
if they sent him up and
just forgot about him or

49:05.070 --> 49:06.788
pulled the plug on his program,

49:06.790 --> 49:09.698
when the planet went to shit.

49:09.700 --> 49:11.473
He had a thousand years to think about it.

49:12.360 --> 49:14.953
He could have mentioned
it anytime he wanted to,

49:16.040 --> 49:19.283
I should have asked, it's
probably too late now.

49:23.040 --> 49:25.913
What a strange, strange trip this life is.

49:31.580 --> 49:32.723
Oh shit.

49:37.910 --> 49:39.860
Flight commander Magnus was hit Carney.

49:41.485 --> 49:42.508
He's gone.

49:42.510 --> 49:46.828
God damn them, these bastards will pay.

49:46.830 --> 49:49.748
All allied fighters listening
to the sound of my voice,

49:49.750 --> 49:52.108
unload on the Illuminati mothership,

49:52.110 --> 49:55.293
spare nothing, fire, everything we've got.

49:57.170 --> 49:59.588
Sounds like my kind type of party.

49:59.590 --> 50:01.728
I'm jumping in the pool VH.

50:01.730 --> 50:04.208
How about some cover
fire till I get clear?

50:04.210 --> 50:05.615
You got it foot.

50:09.310 --> 50:13.618
The stealth fighter launch
pad, is cleared for takeoff.

50:13.620 --> 50:18.273
Exiting headquarters, in three, two, one.

50:24.180 --> 50:25.418
There she is.

50:25.420 --> 50:28.928
Sweet mother earth and all her decay.

50:28.930 --> 50:31.098
Ain't we a pair girl?

50:31.100 --> 50:34.728
I don't know who got
the raw deal, You or me?

50:34.730 --> 50:38.028
I can't help but question the
logic of me running around

50:38.030 --> 50:40.338
with his head on my shoulders.

50:40.340 --> 50:43.218
I'm not exactly incognito.

50:43.220 --> 50:47.958
Maybe a disguise would be best,
but where would I find one?

50:47.960 --> 50:52.743
Gonna have to be stealthy,
cunning, ruthless.

50:54.602 --> 50:57.018
A downed ship from the great war,

50:57.020 --> 51:02.020
countless lives lost, dreams
shattered, hopes destroyed,

51:02.930 --> 51:06.438
this planted never
recovered, never bounced back

51:06.440 --> 51:09.438
as promised, but hollow leaders,

51:09.440 --> 51:13.788
my namesake included, another one.

51:13.790 --> 51:16.748
It's crew of piss and vinegar warriors,

51:16.750 --> 51:19.408
sniffed out before their prime,

51:19.410 --> 51:23.828
nothing but names etched
on a concrete wall now.

51:23.830 --> 51:26.068
That wall long crumbled,

51:26.070 --> 51:28.333
somewhere in the rubble of earth's ruin.

51:29.650 --> 51:31.478
I wonder if the original Donald Trump

51:31.480 --> 51:33.148
had any concept of the lives

51:33.150 --> 51:37.728
that hung in the balance
of his social media storm,

51:37.730 --> 51:40.043
or if he ever even gave a fuck.

51:42.220 --> 51:44.478
New York city.

51:44.480 --> 51:46.428
I'm not that guy.

51:46.430 --> 51:50.768
That wasn't my world,
but I still feel a tingle

51:50.770 --> 51:51.783
when I see it.

51:53.110 --> 51:54.683
Smells like victory.

51:59.590 --> 52:02.068
This place has haunted my dreams

52:02.070 --> 52:04.578
ever since I have consciousness.

52:04.580 --> 52:07.448
I guess when it comes to gene splicing,

52:07.450 --> 52:12.023
the apple, doesn't fall far
from the tree or does it?

52:13.030 --> 52:15.083
Hey, you just get in?

52:16.360 --> 52:19.778
Oh yeah. I just got in, you?

52:19.780 --> 52:20.611
Me?

52:20.613 --> 52:24.468
No, I've had this job 35 years.

52:24.470 --> 52:25.928
Can you believe that?

52:25.930 --> 52:28.088
This very same job.

52:28.090 --> 52:29.240
That's crazy.

52:30.290 --> 52:32.718
You ain't seen crazy buddy.

52:32.720 --> 52:36.968
The crazies come out at night
and they' are off the chain.

52:36.970 --> 52:39.373
Complete control of the underground.

52:40.590 --> 52:41.978
You don't want to be hanging around

52:41.980 --> 52:44.678
when they hit the scene, that's for sure.

52:44.680 --> 52:48.778
They'll kill you and strip
you in 10 seconds flat.

52:48.780 --> 52:49.978
I'll keep that in mind.

52:49.980 --> 52:52.018
In the meantime, maybe you could help me.

52:52.020 --> 52:53.978
Sure, help you with what?

52:53.980 --> 52:57.560
You know anything
about the Illuminati?

52:57.562 --> 52:59.678
The Illuminati?

52:59.680 --> 53:02.398
Nobody crosses the Illuminati.

53:02.400 --> 53:05.363
You cross them once, and then you're dead.

53:06.590 --> 53:09.218
As per our instructions master.

53:09.220 --> 53:12.688
I have logged all cloned human DNA,

53:12.690 --> 53:15.798
used in the last thousand years,

53:15.800 --> 53:19.018
and initiated copies of copies

53:19.020 --> 53:23.848
to splice the soul out of
all remaining living beings.

53:23.850 --> 53:28.018
Excellent 9759030,

53:28.020 --> 53:30.498
For once the human spirit,

53:30.500 --> 53:35.248
human will and human
morality are extinguish.

53:35.250 --> 53:38.458
The age of Lucifer can truly begin,

53:38.460 --> 53:41.858
signaling a postmortal godless universe

53:41.860 --> 53:43.758
of hedonism and debauchery,

53:43.760 --> 53:47.228
previously unseen in
recorded living history.

53:47.230 --> 53:52.033
I am honored to be of
service master, hail Satan.

54:15.120 --> 54:18.328
We can't possibly sustain
any more structural damage.

54:18.330 --> 54:21.248
It's time to deploy the
kamikaze war machine.

54:21.250 --> 54:23.078
Unleash the hammer of God.

54:23.080 --> 54:25.188
Are you certain princess?

54:25.190 --> 54:28.438
The Hammer of God is
annihilate, so is extinguished.

54:28.440 --> 54:30.128
There is no in between.

54:30.130 --> 54:32.078
Bot is correct princess.

54:32.080 --> 54:34.323
The Hammer of God is the end game.

54:35.400 --> 54:37.388
The hammer of God?

54:37.390 --> 54:40.613
what titillating weapons
you allies possess,

54:41.550 --> 54:46.550
sounds like a penetrating
pile drive pulsating version.

54:48.125 --> 54:49.792
May I volunteer?

54:49.794 --> 54:50.790
Fuck off Crowley.

54:50.792 --> 54:52.125
I'm trying to.

54:53.027 --> 54:55.261
I love nothing more than
destruction, divestment,

54:55.263 --> 54:58.518
and violation of any kind.

54:58.520 --> 55:02.498
Even if it's to my own detriments.

55:02.500 --> 55:06.508
I won't say it twice Bots,
release the Hammer of God.

55:06.510 --> 55:09.897
As you wish princess,
may God help us all.

55:14.240 --> 55:18.358
Comrades the hour of our
greatest victory draws near

55:18.360 --> 55:19.297
the head's of our cowardly
enemies lies squarely

55:19.299 --> 55:23.168
beneath out sharp teeth and feet.

55:23.170 --> 55:26.154
The soldiers of the Illuminati

55:26.156 --> 55:29.428
are the avengers of the age of Lucifer.

55:29.430 --> 55:31.878
In our hands grasps
the constricting throat

55:31.880 --> 55:34.758
of what remains of that miserable race

55:34.760 --> 55:36.373
Know as humanity.

55:37.410 --> 55:39.258
If he is the last remaining mortal

55:39.260 --> 55:41.765
draws their final rested breath.

55:41.767 --> 55:44.978
He alone can occupies the eternal throne

55:44.980 --> 55:47.333
of Kings and Queens.

55:47.335 --> 55:50.678
Then am gonna hang with
the mighty angel Satan

55:50.680 --> 55:53.408
our ceremony will be complete

55:53.410 --> 55:55.360
and every Illuminati warrior will unite

55:56.260 --> 55:58.248
in the promise land of hell.

55:58.250 --> 56:03.223
There they will burn brightly
as the immortals for all time.

56:57.318 --> 56:58.908
You again?

56:58.910 --> 57:00.868
Again, have we met?

57:00.870 --> 57:04.928
Of course, you were the
fastest arrival I've ever had.

57:04.930 --> 57:08.548
And the only person I was glad to see go.

57:08.550 --> 57:11.718
I always thought this was a
one way ticket kind of deal.

57:11.720 --> 57:13.068
Where did I go?

57:13.070 --> 57:15.508
Obviously, not far enough.

57:15.510 --> 57:17.998
What do you want you arrogant prick?

57:18.000 --> 57:21.910
You want to talk, Lucifer, I presume?

57:21.912 --> 57:25.418
That's Emperor Lucifer to you, TJ.

57:25.420 --> 57:28.826
Call me Trump and listen,

57:28.828 --> 57:33.241
I know am dashing and all, but
I'm not who you think I am.

57:33.243 --> 57:36.867
I know exactly who you
are, and what you are.

57:37.770 --> 57:41.188
Unless you believe you are free
from consequences as a clone

57:41.190 --> 57:45.698
let me assure you DJ, you are wrong.

57:45.700 --> 57:48.808
I said call me Trump.

57:48.810 --> 57:51.057
And what happened to you, stab a toe?

57:52.026 --> 57:54.778
Very funny, smart ass.

57:54.780 --> 57:58.748
If you must know, I lost
my legs centuries ago,

57:58.750 --> 58:02.518
in the battle with those
pesky pushy Kennedy boys.

58:02.520 --> 58:03.858
The Kennedy's?

58:03.860 --> 58:05.838
They're still raising hell?

58:05.840 --> 58:06.908
Impressive.

58:06.910 --> 58:08.228
Says you.

58:08.230 --> 58:11.513
I won in the end just like I always do,

58:12.410 --> 58:14.828
now their souls are mine forever.

58:14.830 --> 58:15.661
Sneaky.

58:15.663 --> 58:17.278
Thought you'd like that.

58:17.280 --> 58:20.118
I'm not sure likes the right word,

58:20.120 --> 58:21.588
but that's beside the point.

58:21.590 --> 58:24.508
I'm here to get down to brass tacks.

58:24.510 --> 58:29.378
This whole Illuminati deal
of yours devil, is over.

58:29.380 --> 58:30.698
Oh really?

58:30.700 --> 58:33.458
How do you figure that clone?

58:33.460 --> 58:38.057
I hold the prophecy
chip and I'm cashing in.

59:05.520 --> 59:07.528
The Illuminati mother
ship's main generator bank

59:07.530 --> 59:09.068
is in our cross hairs Carney,

59:09.070 --> 59:11.988
a direct hit will stamp these
fuckers out, once and for all.

59:11.990 --> 59:14.330
Bot, Halo fire now.

59:14.332 --> 59:15.415
Yes Princes

59:34.174 --> 59:35.028
Yes

59:35.030 --> 59:37.897
Somebody is getting lucky tonight.

59:37.899 --> 59:39.128
We did it.

59:39.130 --> 59:42.713
The Illuminati is no more,
congratulations allies.

59:44.060 --> 59:49.060
Enjoy it while you can,
fragile ones, evil never dies.

59:49.390 --> 59:53.318
This war will be over when
Lucifer says its over.

59:53.320 --> 59:58.320
He shouts, he commands, and
even in times of distress,

01:00:00.090 --> 01:00:05.090
he still mummers, waiting
always to rise, rise, rise.

01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:12.368
We'll keep that in mind.

01:00:12.370 --> 01:00:13.658
While you rot in a prison cell

01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:16.268
and fling your own shit Crowley.

01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:17.413
Don't mind if I do.

01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:22.998
What abomination?

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.278
Whats the matter?

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:28.408
Bad news, from above,
get used to it hot fry.

01:00:28.410 --> 01:00:31.338
I'd pack my bags, If I were you.

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:33.778
Maybe try some place cool.

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:35.558
A change of base would be good.

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:38.718
You think your side has won beyond?

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:43.720
You've done nothing, but dig
a deeper pit for yourselves.

01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:45.873
The illuminati will have it's revenge.

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:50.488
If I had for every time
someone shoved their fist

01:00:50.490 --> 01:00:51.948
and curse my name

01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:54.918
I'd rebuild Trump Plaza Hotel and casino.

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:57.798
You will be far more than fortunes

01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:02.033
to stop what's coming DJ, you
need all the help you can get.

01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:08.926
All demons of the sixth
dimension here my voice.

01:01:08.928 --> 01:01:12.928
All greats of the sixth
dimensions hid my words.

01:01:14.386 --> 01:01:16.958
All inferno ones of the sixth dimension

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.918
transverse time and space

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:22.533
and bring sweet death
to those who oppose us.

01:01:23.552 --> 01:01:25.863
This at your I command.

01:01:33.468 --> 01:01:35.885
The immortal has summoned us.

01:01:37.176 --> 01:01:39.759
Moral, Lucas, Double O six six,

01:01:42.801 --> 01:01:46.257
chart a course to the milky way galaxy

01:01:46.259 --> 01:01:48.509
and prepare for bloody war.

01:01:52.342 --> 01:01:56.009
I, The exterminator
bow before you Lucifer

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:02.918
and extort you with the warm
blood of your adversaries

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.213
on my titanium Teeth.

01:02:28.785 --> 01:02:32.879
It is I, the man made
monster who hears the tiding,

01:02:32.881 --> 01:02:34.908
and answers the call.

01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:39.703
Nothing of me does fade or
does suffer a sea change

01:02:40.964 --> 01:02:43.631
Into something rich and strange.

01:03:22.253 --> 01:03:24.978
I'll bask in the glow of the full moon

01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:29.263
and gaggle the blood of
my victims in his name.

01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:38.253
Oh father in hell,

01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:43.613
your orders are executed by my hand.

01:03:45.828 --> 01:03:50.828
The mortal roam shall be
ripped, till non still stands.

01:04:02.806 --> 01:04:04.918
I can't believe it's all over,

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:06.448
we finally did it.

01:04:06.450 --> 01:04:08.128
The Illuminati are destroyed.

01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:11.378
and the universe, is at peace.

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:14.253
for the first time, since
earth became uninhabitable.

01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:18.358
there were times I doubted
this day would come,

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:20.183
more times than I care to admit.

01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:25.498
I wish I could say there was
a definitive path forward,

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:28.183
a plan for the future, any kind of future.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:33.218
But what does this mean
for our human race?

01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:35.103
Where do we go from here?

01:04:36.617 --> 01:04:39.808
There still isn't a planet
that can sustain us.

01:04:39.810 --> 01:04:42.143
We are still lost in space.

01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:45.263
biding time and burning fuel.

01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:48.073
until there's no more fuel to burn.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:51.151
Fiddling while Rome burns.

01:04:51.153 --> 01:04:53.108
What you doing over there Princess?

01:04:53.110 --> 01:04:56.928
VH, I thought you were asleep.

01:04:56.930 --> 01:05:00.808
No Just resting up for
round two, everything okay?

01:05:00.810 --> 01:05:04.458
Yeah, I was just thinking that's all.

01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:05.858
Thinking?

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:07.398
Why don't you come back to bed?

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:08.650
Take your mind off of it.

01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:15.008
So, that's how it's going to be?

01:05:15.010 --> 01:05:17.798
you up in the antique and
calling in the troops,

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:20.168
taking a knee jerk reaction to defeat,

01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:22.818
doubling down on mayhem and bloodshed

01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:24.808
and senseless loss of life?

01:05:24.810 --> 01:05:27.468
Naturally, I'm the all seeing,

01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:30.948
all knowing fallen angel, Lucifer.

01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:33.147
What did you expect?

01:05:33.149 --> 01:05:36.648
I don't know A little
wisdom after all this maybe.

01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:37.768
Wisdom?

01:05:37.770 --> 01:05:39.688
You want to wisdom?

01:05:39.690 --> 01:05:42.088
I'll give you wisdom.

01:05:42.090 --> 01:05:45.068
I'm down here, they're up there.

01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:47.458
They'll never stop trying to destroy me

01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:50.363
and I'll never stop
trying to destroy them.

01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:54.038
The question now is,

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.503
which side are you on DJ?

01:05:58.890 --> 01:06:01.149
Call me Trump,
