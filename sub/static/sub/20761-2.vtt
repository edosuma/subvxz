[doorbell rings]

00:55.681 --> 00:58.101
-[Jean] Hey, Tom. How are you?
-[Tom] Hey, how are you?

00:58.183 --> 00:59.483
-[Jean] Come on in.
-[Tom] Hello.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.520
[Jean] Good to see you.

01:06.191 --> 01:10.701
Being Jane Doe,
for me, that was paramount.

01:11.280 --> 01:15.030
I didn't want anyone to know who I was,
I didn't want anybody to know my family.

01:15.742 --> 01:21.872
For quite some time, I trusted
that I had some privacy with that.

01:22.207 --> 01:24.627
Because I was always afraid
of what people were gonna say

01:24.710 --> 01:26.420
and think about what I had said.

01:27.754 --> 01:32.054
What's your view
of what most likely happened to her?

01:34.303 --> 01:39.023
I believe
that Cathy Cesnik was murdered...

01:39.516 --> 01:41.806
by someone she knew.

01:41.893 --> 01:46.903
I believe that it wasn't a stranger
who killed Cathy Cesnik.

01:47.691 --> 01:51.951
It may have been a stranger to her
who moved her body,

01:52.029 --> 01:56.529
or a stranger to her who cleaned up after,

01:56.783 --> 02:01.463
but I don't believe that it was a stranger
who killed Cathy Cesnik.

02:01.538 --> 02:04.828
Cathy Cesnik was killed
because she was going to talk

02:05.125 --> 02:07.245
about what went on at that school,

02:07.502 --> 02:10.842
and I believe
that there were more than one person

02:10.922 --> 02:14.932
who was really afraid
that she was going to, um, out them.

02:16.219 --> 02:20.889
And they used her death to keep me quiet.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.696
[marching band playing]

03:46.685 --> 03:49.935
[Tom] <i>Baltimore has always been</i>
<i>a quintessentially Catholic city.</i>

03:52.482 --> 03:54.742
<i>Baltimore is the home</i>
<i>of Roman Catholicism.</i>

03:55.819 --> 03:58.819
<i>John Carroll founded</i>
<i>the first archdiocese here,</i>

03:58.905 --> 04:00.905
<i>maybe the late 1700s.</i>

04:03.577 --> 04:06.457
[Deb] <i>Baltimore is a city of firsts.</i>

04:07.664 --> 04:09.004
<i>The first telegraph...</i>

04:11.001 --> 04:13.171
<i>the first streetlights...</i>

04:14.129 --> 04:15.169
<i>the trains.</i>

04:17.632 --> 04:21.642
<i>And it is the first diocese</i>
<i>in the United States.</i>

04:22.179 --> 04:26.809
<i>Every neighborhood had its own parish.</i>
<i>Everybody went to church.</i>

04:26.892 --> 04:28.602
<i>I mean, rosary,</i>

04:29.144 --> 04:31.484
<i>May processions were a big thing,</i>

04:31.897 --> 04:33.107
<i>First Communions.</i>

04:33.690 --> 04:36.490
<i>All the Sacraments were a really big deal.</i>

04:37.819 --> 04:42.739
You were not only going to school
with people that were Catholic,

04:42.824 --> 04:46.334
going to church with people Catholic,
you were living in Catholic communities.

04:48.330 --> 04:51.500
[Tom] <i>But Baltimore has always been</i>
<i>a working-class city.</i>

04:53.752 --> 04:56.712
<i>In 1969, when Sister Cathy dies,</i>

04:57.214 --> 05:02.394
<i>we lived in a much more basic,</i>
<i>simplistic, primitive society.</i>

05:04.262 --> 05:08.522
<i>This is a world of blue-collar folks,</i>
<i>they're working in these factory jobs.</i>

05:09.768 --> 05:12.148
<i>They are living in little row houses,</i>

05:12.229 --> 05:14.859
<i>they are tending</i>
<i>little postage-stamp lawns.</i>

05:15.565 --> 05:17.435
<i>They are living for that glorious moment</i>

05:17.526 --> 05:22.196
when their little daughter puts on a veil
and goes for her First Communion.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.786
[Jean] <i>I was one of ten siblings.</i>

05:29.162 --> 05:34.042
<i>There were three boys...</i>
<i>me, then three boys,</i>

05:34.501 --> 05:36.551
<i>then there were two girls and a boy.</i>

05:37.671 --> 05:41.131
It was a good Catholic family.
Eleven months later you had another baby.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.474
[inaudible]

05:54.062 --> 05:57.072
<i>My parents were good Catholic parents.</i>

05:58.608 --> 06:01.608
<i>Everybody went to church on Sunday,</i>

06:01.695 --> 06:05.155
<i>and if you didn't have a ride</i>
<i>because dad was a policeman</i>

06:05.240 --> 06:08.080
<i>and he worked shift work,</i>
<i>you'd walk to church.</i>

06:08.952 --> 06:10.292
[Ed] <i>You know, it was unheard of</i>

06:10.370 --> 06:15.580
to either miss church on Sunday
or eat meat on Friday.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.417
During the Cuban Missile Crisis,

06:17.502 --> 06:19.842
we all knelt down and said the rosary.

06:21.256 --> 06:24.676
<i>The Catholic religion, the Catholic faith</i>
<i>was part of who we were.</i>

06:29.055 --> 06:30.425
[Don] <i>We were all altar boys.</i>

06:31.308 --> 06:34.478
<i>We were told it was an honor</i>
<i>and a privilege to be an altar boy.</i>

06:36.896 --> 06:39.976
<i>The priests were the authority.</i>

06:40.984 --> 06:42.364
You don't question them.

06:42.444 --> 06:46.414
Uh, you-- You--
Whatever they told you to do, you did.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.327
[Ed] <i>My mom was very devout.</i>

06:48.408 --> 06:51.698
<i>It was an integral part of the family,</i>
<i>which came from her.</i>

06:52.245 --> 06:55.075
[Mike] <i>But my dad was there.</i>
<i>I mean, like, if we went to confession,</i>

06:55.498 --> 06:59.588
<i>it was nothing like seeing your father go</i>
<i>to confession first and then come out.</i>

06:59.669 --> 07:03.089
It was kind of like-- If he believed
and trusted the confessional,

07:03.173 --> 07:04.223
then we all did, too.

07:05.675 --> 07:09.425
[Bob] <i> My mother was, in fact,</i>
<i>a true Christian.</i>

07:10.263 --> 07:13.143
If you lived right and you loved God,

07:13.558 --> 07:15.228
<i>that faith that you exhibited,</i>

07:15.477 --> 07:18.227
<i>plus the love that you had</i>
<i>for your fellow man,</i>

07:18.647 --> 07:23.187
<i>would provide the hope that you need</i>
<i>in order to succeed.</i>

07:34.162 --> 07:36.162
[indistinct chatter over TV]

07:38.500 --> 07:39.920
Got you some cereal,

07:40.293 --> 07:44.763
put some strawberries on it today
instead of banana.

07:47.842 --> 07:50.802
-So, there's that, okay?
-Mm-hm.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.137
Your coffee.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.023
We'll let that cool a little bit.

07:56.017 --> 07:56.937
Alrighty?

08:09.698 --> 08:10.868
This is my senior.

08:12.075 --> 08:17.155
This was the end
of a pretty horrific experience.

08:17.539 --> 08:22.879
And I probably was relieved
that it was... ending.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.341
She holds memories,

08:26.423 --> 08:28.933
and I've been afraid of those memories.

08:37.392 --> 08:42.312
[Gemma] <i>Archbishop Keough was the jewel</i>
<i>in the archdiocese.</i>

08:43.398 --> 08:45.938
It was a really nice new school.

08:46.484 --> 08:50.414
<i>It had that spanking-new type</i>
<i>of, uh, look to it.</i>

08:51.489 --> 08:55.289
[Gemma] <i>Run by nuns,</i>
<i>the School Sisters of Notre Dame.</i>

08:56.870 --> 09:00.620
[Teresa] <i>It was really a big deal</i>
<i>to be accepted to go to Archbishop Keough.</i>

09:01.041 --> 09:03.501
You had to get in.
You had to take an entrance exam.

09:03.585 --> 09:06.545
So, the big day in eighth grade
would be when you came home for lunch

09:06.629 --> 09:10.799
and your letter was waiting for you
that you had been admitted to Keough.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.295
[Kathy] <i>It was prestigious.</i>

09:14.262 --> 09:16.772
I was very excited because that's exactly

09:16.848 --> 09:20.098
where I wanted to go. It was
within walking distance of my house.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.690
[Teresa] <i>I really was excited about going.</i>

09:22.771 --> 09:26.071
I remember my freshman year,
I was very, very happy to be there.

09:27.942 --> 09:31.492
My parents worked hard
that I could go to it.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.702
[Deb] <i>It was very exciting...</i>

09:35.408 --> 09:37.038
but really strict.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.656
<i>There was order, discipline.</i>

09:40.955 --> 09:44.745
You know, you had nuns all over the place.
There were a lot of nuns.

09:47.462 --> 09:52.262
[Gemma] <i>Our administrators were nuns,</i>
<i>our principal, our assistant principal.</i>

09:53.384 --> 09:55.514
<i>Joseph Maskell was the chaplain.</i>

09:57.180 --> 10:02.560
<i>There was also a priest</i>
<i>by the name of Father Neil Magnus.</i>

10:03.019 --> 10:07.819
-He was responsible for studies or...
-Christian education or something--

10:07.899 --> 10:10.359
I never saw the man, that I remember.

10:20.537 --> 10:24.997
[Teresa] <i>They had language labs</i>
<i>and really state-of-the-art equipment.</i>

10:25.542 --> 10:27.712
[Donna] <i>They had a science room.</i>

10:28.670 --> 10:30.550
[Gemma] <i>They had a large gym.</i>

10:30.630 --> 10:34.470
<i>It had a large outdoor field</i>
<i>for different sports.</i>

10:35.677 --> 10:39.677
[Teresa] <i>They even put</i>
<i>"we are women of a new age" in their song,</i>

10:40.014 --> 10:44.644
and it was just supposed to be women
being able to reach their full potential.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.517
It was supposed to be a safe place.

10:53.611 --> 10:57.241
My life would have been very different
if I had not gone in that confessional.

11:02.704 --> 11:03.914
<i>I was at Keough.</i>

11:03.997 --> 11:05.117
<i>I was a freshman.</i>

11:07.208 --> 11:09.538
<i>I went to confession there.</i>

11:12.964 --> 11:15.684
<i>It took me five tries</i>
<i>to get to the confessional.</i>

11:19.304 --> 11:20.814
<i>I got in the confessional...</i>

11:21.389 --> 11:26.689
<i>and I told the priest something</i>
<i>that I was feeling very guilty about.</i>

11:29.272 --> 11:32.402
<i>I had been abused by an uncle</i>
<i>when I was younger.</i>

11:33.443 --> 11:37.953
He was a pedophile
and he was sexually abusing me.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.040
<i>That had ended, there was some guilt.</i>

11:43.995 --> 11:48.075
<i>And I always remembered it was Magnus</i>
<i>and always remembered that he said:</i>

11:48.791 --> 11:50.881
"Can I look at you,
and what is your name?"

11:52.503 --> 11:55.473
<i>And I always thought,</i>
<i>"God, this must have been so terrible</i>

11:55.548 --> 11:57.718
that he had to look at me
and ask my name."

11:59.636 --> 12:01.886
<i>And at the end of it he said:</i>

12:01.971 --> 12:04.521
<i>"I don't really know</i>
<i>if God can forgive this.</i>

12:05.058 --> 12:08.388
<i>I'm going to have to pray more on this</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you."</i>

12:21.240 --> 12:24.950
<i>Probably a couple weeks later,</i>
<i>the same priest, Magnus,</i>

12:25.036 --> 12:26.656
<i>walked up to me in the hall...</i>

12:27.705 --> 12:30.495
<i>and he said</i>
<i>he wanted to see me in his office.</i>

12:35.296 --> 12:37.546
<i>And Magnus was there...</i>

12:37.924 --> 12:42.264
<i>and he proceeded to just reiterate</i>
<i>that I was so bad...</i>

12:42.679 --> 12:48.939
that it was going to take a while
before there was going to be a real answer

12:49.018 --> 12:50.688
to whether God could forgive me.

12:52.605 --> 12:57.355
<i>And that if I emptied myself</i>
<i>of these behaviors</i>

12:57.443 --> 13:00.453
<i>that were so sinful, so bad...</i>

13:00.989 --> 13:02.529
<i>that it would make room for God</i>

13:02.615 --> 13:05.695
<i>to be able to fill me</i>
<i>with the Holy Spirit...</i>

13:06.369 --> 13:08.619
<i>and that I could be forgiven.</i>

13:09.706 --> 13:12.876
The things that he was doing
was "sacramental,"

13:12.959 --> 13:14.129
you know, quote-unquote.

13:14.585 --> 13:15.495
Um...

13:15.586 --> 13:22.046
That, you know, he talked about, uh,
his come as the Eucharist, you know.

13:22.135 --> 13:26.925
He was doing symbols on me
of the crucifix with it

13:27.015 --> 13:29.635
as if it was, uh, sacred.

13:30.143 --> 13:35.313
He was also saying that his come was
the Holy Spirit that I was to swallow.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.399
<i>I was very naive.</i>

13:39.110 --> 13:40.860
<i>I was extremely innocent.</i>

13:41.446 --> 13:46.616
I had no idea
that this was, um, abusive.

13:46.701 --> 13:50.751
I felt that it was a man of...

13:51.039 --> 13:53.789
Of authority, of faith,

13:53.875 --> 13:59.005
who was helping me become a good person.

14:00.006 --> 14:05.506
He was reminding me
that the things that I had done were--

14:05.595 --> 14:08.255
weren't done to me.
That I made those things happen.

14:11.309 --> 14:15.729
<i>After a couple of my therapy sessions</i>
<i>with him,</i>

14:15.813 --> 14:17.443
<i>I went into the room...</i>

14:18.441 --> 14:20.741
<i>and then Maskell came in.</i>

14:23.863 --> 14:26.373
<i>From the beginning,</i>
<i>I was afraid of Maskell.</i>

14:26.657 --> 14:29.617
<i>He had no qualms being angry with me.</i>

14:30.036 --> 14:32.956
<i>He started very early on</i>
<i>calling me a whore.</i>

14:35.041 --> 14:39.881
They would pray in Latin over me
as they were having me do things to them,

14:39.962 --> 14:42.342
or they were doing things to me.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.973
Or one would be praying over me in Latin

14:45.051 --> 14:48.261
while the other one would be,
you know, kind of saying:

14:48.346 --> 14:52.176
"Take the Holy Spirit," and, um--
You know, through his penis.

14:53.810 --> 14:57.560
<i>So, it is a very interesting dynamic</i>
<i>to feel both of them in the room,</i>

14:57.647 --> 14:58.977
<i>to be cornered by them both,</i>

14:59.065 --> 15:04.695
<i>to feel two men of not only great size,</i>

15:05.071 --> 15:09.161
<i>but that they were powerful</i>
<i>because they represented God.</i>

15:11.119 --> 15:14.159
I-- I wanted to get out of that room,

15:14.622 --> 15:18.632
and yet I felt that
I had to be in the room in order to...

15:19.293 --> 15:21.923
to... be a good person.

15:22.630 --> 15:27.090
It was-- It was the beginning
of some of the thickest confusion

15:27.510 --> 15:30.430
that, um, probably could be imagined.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.403
<i>At a particular point...</i>

15:38.187 --> 15:42.687
<i>I went to the room</i>
<i>and it was just Maskell there.</i>

15:43.526 --> 15:45.446
<i>And it was a very scary point.</i>

15:47.947 --> 15:52.447
<i>He was angry at me</i>
<i>because I wasn't getting better.</i>

15:53.995 --> 15:58.455
I remember one time he was real angry
and he was raping me.

15:58.541 --> 16:02.341
And I can remember
my head hitting the... the wall.

16:04.839 --> 16:07.339
<i>He was really upset and angry</i>
<i>about something...</i>

16:07.758 --> 16:10.338
<i>and he was really taking it out on me.</i>

16:12.388 --> 16:14.468
I couldn't figure out what I could do

16:14.557 --> 16:17.727
because I kept feeling
like every time it was over, I thought:

16:17.810 --> 16:19.810
"Well, maybe this time God forgave me."

16:23.441 --> 16:28.071
[Deb] <i>I had never been in a school</i>
<i>where a priest had a presence</i>

16:28.154 --> 16:31.784
<i>like the priests had there,</i>
<i>because they had offices at Keough.</i>

16:33.117 --> 16:36.367
Father Maskell wielded a lot of power

16:36.621 --> 16:39.371
and fear in people

16:39.457 --> 16:42.537
because you didn't wanna be called
to his office or get in trouble.

16:43.336 --> 16:47.086
[Lil] <i>He was chaplain</i>
<i>and school counselor at Keough.</i>

16:48.674 --> 16:51.014
The building itself was a very long...

16:51.093 --> 16:55.473
<i>rectangle with some corridors</i>
<i>that went off in different directions.</i>

16:55.806 --> 17:00.136
<i>And his office was far</i>
<i>from the administrative offices.</i>

17:00.228 --> 17:03.898
<i>He was down at the far corner</i>
<i>where there was an exit.</i>

17:04.690 --> 17:08.069
You used to see a lot of girls
coming in and out of his office,

17:08.152 --> 17:10.202
which was kind of strange.

17:10.279 --> 17:11.819
But then I learned that:

17:11.906 --> 17:12.906
"Hey, you know what?

17:12.990 --> 17:16.490
If you wanna smoke, you-- You can go
in Maskell's office and smoke.

17:16.577 --> 17:18.867
Just go in there, talk to him,
just hang out and talk."

17:20.873 --> 17:22.542
[Tom] <i>Maskell was an Irish priest</i>

17:22.625 --> 17:27.954
<i>right out of the traditional</i>
<i>working-class Irish-American community.</i>

17:29.048 --> 17:33.008
His mother often dressed her boy
in Mass vestments.

17:33.094 --> 17:35.934
She used to sew him vestments
and he'd dress up in them and--

17:36.013 --> 17:36.853
Mm-hm.

17:36.931 --> 17:39.061
--call the neighborhood kids over
to say Mass for them.

17:40.309 --> 17:44.809
She went and bought NECCO Wafers
and she segregated the white ones out

17:44.897 --> 17:48.937
so that they could serve
as imitation hosts for Communion.

17:49.527 --> 17:52.027
<i>While the other boys were playing</i>
<i>football and baseball</i>

17:52.113 --> 17:54.283
<i>down two blocks away at the park...</i>

17:56.784 --> 17:58.624
he would say Mass in the yard.

17:58.703 --> 18:00.713
[man speaking in Latin]

18:01.372 --> 18:04.792
[Tom] <i>From 15 years old,</i>
<i>he was priest-in-training.</i>

18:07.670 --> 18:10.090
[Abbie] <i>In '65, he was ordained.</i>

18:11.716 --> 18:15.596
And then his first assignment
from 1965 to 1966

18:16.178 --> 18:19.178
<i>was at a Baltimore parish</i>
<i>named Sacred Heart of Mary.</i>

18:21.142 --> 18:26.612
<i>In '66, he was transferred</i>
<i>to St. Clement Parish, which is adjacent</i>

18:26.689 --> 18:28.769
<i>to Archbishop Keough High School.</i>

18:29.942 --> 18:32.452
He was made associate pastor there.

18:34.822 --> 18:37.032
And he supervised
the Boy Scout troop there.

18:51.672 --> 18:52.972
This is my, uh...

18:54.342 --> 18:57.472
I guess--
My wife calls it a dust collection room.

18:59.513 --> 19:02.313
That was my retirement certificate.

19:04.185 --> 19:06.515
There's my grandfather.
The great-great-grandfather

19:06.604 --> 19:09.944
I was telling you about,
Southern District policeman in Baltimore,

19:10.024 --> 19:11.984
and there's a picture of him later.

19:13.944 --> 19:16.364
Me and my brother worked

19:16.447 --> 19:18.697
in the police station
he worked out of, so...

19:19.408 --> 19:20.908
Kind of like family tradition.

19:25.998 --> 19:30.798
<i>When I started Catholic school</i>
<i>in the early '60s,</i>

19:30.878 --> 19:32.508
<i>it was a pretty harsh environment.</i>

19:33.631 --> 19:34.631
We were paddled.

19:34.715 --> 19:38.755
I mean, the nuns--
We feared the nuns and--

19:39.011 --> 19:43.061
Not only the nuns, but the priests,
they were on a whole different level.

19:43.140 --> 19:47.560
The priests were...
more like godlike figures, and...

19:48.229 --> 19:52.569
I mean, they'd walk in the room,
it'd just be silence, and, um...

19:52.650 --> 19:56.200
<i>But this priest, Father Joseph Maskell,</i>
<i>there was something about him.</i>

19:56.737 --> 20:00.197
<i>He had a... </i> [sighs] <i> coldness about him.</i>

20:00.741 --> 20:03.291
<i>And I've served Mass</i>
<i>for different priests.</i>

20:04.662 --> 20:08.292
<i>And one day,</i>
<i>we were getting ready for Mass--</i>

20:08.374 --> 20:11.004
<i>You know, the altar boys,</i>
<i>we'd get there a little early.</i>

20:11.085 --> 20:13.335
<i>He'd come into the sacristy and, um...</i>

20:14.422 --> 20:17.302
He takes a handgun out of his pocket
and put it on the...

20:17.383 --> 20:18.803
<i>the counter in the sacristy.</i>

20:19.176 --> 20:22.006
<i>And being a street-smart kid,</i>
<i>you know, from the city,</i>

20:22.555 --> 20:25.265
<i>growing up watching </i> Adam-12
<i>and things like that, I mean...</i>

20:27.268 --> 20:30.518
<i>Probably most kids</i>
<i>wouldn't have questioned him, but...</i>

20:31.230 --> 20:32.190
<i>I just let it go.</i>

20:32.773 --> 20:35.153
And I asked him,
"Father, why do you have a handgun?

20:35.234 --> 20:37.324
You're a priest."
And I'll never forget that.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.953
But I'll also never forget
the look he gave me.

20:40.281 --> 20:42.741
I mean, he--
Like as if he looked through me:

20:42.825 --> 20:44.075
"How dare you question me."

20:46.120 --> 20:48.080
<i>I didn't get a look like that...</i>

20:48.956 --> 20:53.666
<i>until years later</i>
<i>interviewing violent offenders...</i>

20:54.044 --> 20:56.594
<i>talking to someone</i>
<i>who had murdered somebody,</i>

20:56.672 --> 20:57.722
<i>looking in their eyes.</i>

20:57.798 --> 20:59.378
<i>That's when I got that look again.</i>

21:13.522 --> 21:16.572
[Jean] <i> One time I went into the room</i>
<i>and he said,</i>

21:16.650 --> 21:20.150
<i>uh, that it was time for me</i>
<i>to participate in this.</i>

21:21.614 --> 21:24.704
<i>And he went over</i>
<i>and took something out of the drawer,</i>

21:24.784 --> 21:26.044
and it looked like a penis.

21:26.577 --> 21:29.827
And I was, like, not sure

21:29.914 --> 21:32.084
what in the world he was doing
or what that was.

21:33.125 --> 21:37.755
<i>He said, "So, now, you're gonna be</i>
<i>participating in your therapy."</i>

21:39.507 --> 21:43.007
And so he began to use it,
and I remember crying and saying:

21:43.093 --> 21:44.973
"Please stop that, please stop that."

21:45.054 --> 21:48.354
And as it began to take effect...

21:48.933 --> 21:51.643
he came down real close
and, you know, he was like:

21:51.727 --> 21:54.477
"Okay, let's see
how much the whore likes it," you know.

21:54.688 --> 21:59.488
Um, and so then I had an orgasm,
not knowing what that was.

22:02.279 --> 22:05.069
<i>He came in close.</i>
<i>He always liked to come down close.</i>

22:05.699 --> 22:07.699
<i>And he said, "You hated that...</i>

22:08.494 --> 22:09.504
<i>and I'm glad."</i>

22:10.621 --> 22:13.461
And he said,
"Get back to class. Don't be late."

22:15.501 --> 22:17.171
He never gave me a napkin.

22:17.253 --> 22:19.263
He never would hand me a handkerchief.

22:19.797 --> 22:25.547
He never told me I could use his bathroom.

22:25.636 --> 22:26.966
It was always...

22:27.805 --> 22:30.925
Uh, "Pull yourself together
and get back to class."

22:38.607 --> 22:40.227
And I'd hear the click of the door,

22:40.317 --> 22:42.697
and it was like I forgot everything
that had happened.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.700
<i>I was walking in the hall...</i>

22:50.202 --> 22:53.252
and I couldn't figure out
where I was supposed to be.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.036
[sobbing]

22:59.128 --> 23:02.838
<i>And Cathy Cesnik looked down</i>
<i>and she said, "Jean, where are you--?</i>

23:02.923 --> 23:05.763
Where are you supposed to be?"
And I said, "I don't know."

23:08.971 --> 23:10.141
[sniffles]

23:10.222 --> 23:11.772
So, she told her class to...

23:13.517 --> 23:15.597
She'd be a minute
and she went across the hall

23:15.686 --> 23:18.436
and she asked the teacher,
"Is Jean supposed to be in here?"

23:18.522 --> 23:21.362
And she said, "Yes." And she said,
"Jean, you belong in here."

23:21.650 --> 23:23.740
Then I went in and I sat down in a desk.

23:32.745 --> 23:37.705
Sister Cathy was the type of person
that was approachable,

23:37.791 --> 23:41.341
and you knew that you could talk to her.

23:41.712 --> 23:44.802
<i>You didn't get that all the time</i>
<i>from the older nuns.</i>

23:45.633 --> 23:48.013
You didn't feel
like you could connect with them.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.803
They were more authoritarian.

23:50.304 --> 23:53.104
Sister Cathy was my favorite teacher.

23:54.475 --> 23:58.555
<i>I played guitar,</i>
<i>so I had my guitar with me all the time.</i>

23:59.063 --> 24:04.403
<i>And Sister Cathy played guitar, too,</i>
<i>so I did a lot of practicing with her.</i>

24:05.944 --> 24:09.204
<i>She had more energy</i>
<i>than any person I've ever met.</i>

24:09.698 --> 24:12.948
<i>Very upbeat and happy.</i>

24:14.244 --> 24:17.964
You could talk to her about anything
you wanted to talk to her about and...

24:19.416 --> 24:23.086
Sometimes she would give you advice
and sometimes she would just listen.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.877
<i>She just had a way of soothing your soul.</i>

24:33.806 --> 24:37.226
At Keough, she was probably around... 25.

24:38.102 --> 24:39.772
So young.

24:41.063 --> 24:43.193
<i>All through elementary school,</i>

24:43.273 --> 24:46.323
<i>the majority of the nuns</i>
<i>that taught you were older.</i>

24:46.694 --> 24:51.744
I mean, I had the same second grade nun
that my father and his brothers had.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.624
So, she must have been a hundred.

24:54.535 --> 24:55.985
<i>When we got to Keough,</i>

24:56.704 --> 24:58.254
<i>there were a lot of older ones.</i>

24:58.330 --> 25:01.920
<i>But there were a few young ones, too.</i>

25:03.877 --> 25:07.337
<i>Cathy was the standout beauty of them all.</i>

25:08.132 --> 25:11.682
<i>Physically beautiful,</i>
<i>and her spirit was beautiful.</i>

25:13.011 --> 25:15.261
It was like, "Why would you be a nun?"

25:25.107 --> 25:28.607
[man] <i>She approaches the altar</i>
<i>to become the spouse of God,</i>

25:28.694 --> 25:31.864
<i>promising to serve God faithfully</i>
<i>until death.</i>

25:46.795 --> 25:50.585
These are calendars
called Nuns Having Fun,

25:50.674 --> 25:52.764
and they're absolutely fabulous.

25:53.719 --> 25:56.469
This is called
Sisters on the Dock of the Bay,

25:56.722 --> 25:58.682
instead of Sitting on the Dock of the Bay.

25:58.766 --> 26:00.726
[singing]
<i>â™ª Sisters on the dock of the bay â™ª</i>

26:00.809 --> 26:02.059
Oh. [laughs]

26:03.771 --> 26:05.731
This is called Mass Transit.

26:06.273 --> 26:07.193
Mass Transit.

26:08.317 --> 26:09.147
Get it?

26:10.027 --> 26:12.397
"I'd yell, too,
but I took a vow of silence."

26:12.488 --> 26:14.488
[chuckling]

26:18.076 --> 26:21.156
<i>My very first day of school,</i>
<i>two nuns came out.</i>

26:21.246 --> 26:23.616
I'd never seen a nun before
in my whole life.

26:23.707 --> 26:27.287
Immediately, I thought,
that's what I'm gonna be when I grow up.

26:27.377 --> 26:29.047
I had no idea what that meant.

26:29.296 --> 26:31.506
I'd never seen a nun before
in my whole life.

26:31.799 --> 26:34.639
I just knew in my heart
that's what I wanted to do.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.850
[Cecelia] <i>I loved elementary school</i>
<i>and I loved the nuns.</i>

26:42.100 --> 26:45.350
They were mentors to us.
They were other mothers.

26:46.063 --> 26:51.363
<i>So, I decided that if I wanted to do</i>
<i>something special with my life,</i>

26:51.693 --> 26:54.033
<i>I could go into the convent.</i>

26:54.112 --> 26:58.532
So, I decided to enter
the School Sisters of Notre Dame.

26:59.827 --> 27:02.747
[Lyn] <i>We had 51 girls that entered.</i>

27:04.289 --> 27:05.959
<i>You're measured for a habit.</i>

27:06.500 --> 27:08.380
And then the habit is sent to you,

27:09.044 --> 27:12.054
<i>and then you go to the motherhouse,</i>
<i>and I can see it in my mind.</i>

27:12.965 --> 27:14.465
<i>That day was so happy.</i>

27:14.550 --> 27:17.340
<i>I waited for that day</i>
<i>since I was in the first grade.</i>

27:18.595 --> 27:21.925
For me, it was a real honor
that they accepted me

27:22.015 --> 27:24.635
and that I could get--
I could begin that journey.

27:25.519 --> 27:27.859
<i>There's, like, over 150 people</i>

27:28.105 --> 27:32.105
<i>that were between the ages of 18 and 21</i>
<i>that were there.</i>

27:32.192 --> 27:34.442
It was very, very inspiring.

27:34.528 --> 27:36.738
[all singing indistinctly]

27:36.822 --> 27:41.792
[Lyn] <i>We became canonical novices,</i>
<i>which meant that we were cloistered.</i>

27:42.411 --> 27:46.501
<i>It's exactly like military boot camp,</i>
<i>and it's pretty, uh, rigorous.</i>

27:47.291 --> 27:51.091
I call what we had to go through
spiritual boot camp.

27:52.504 --> 27:55.304
<i>We'd get up in the morning at 5:15,</i>

27:56.258 --> 27:57.508
<i>we'd go to Mass,</i>

27:58.302 --> 27:59.642
<i>we'd have meditation.</i>

28:01.597 --> 28:02.927
<i>We'd go to breakfast,</i>

28:03.265 --> 28:05.675
<i>and after breakfast,</i>
<i>you would have your chore to do,</i>

28:05.767 --> 28:07.057
<i>whatever you were assigned.</i>

28:08.020 --> 28:09.480
<i>Then we had classes.</i>

28:10.188 --> 28:14.318
And we had to learn
how to walk with our hands in our sleeves.

28:14.401 --> 28:19.241
We had great, big, giant sleeves
and our eyes mortified, cast down,

28:19.615 --> 28:25.075
<i>and our shoulders back and very erect,</i>
<i>and without looking about.</i>

28:27.372 --> 28:33.002
<i>Cathy Cesnik was definitely</i>
<i>not one of the dominant postulants</i>

28:33.086 --> 28:34.546
<i>in the beginning days.</i>

28:36.089 --> 28:38.929
She was like a rosebud
that gradually opened.

28:40.344 --> 28:41.604
<i>She was kind.</i>

28:41.929 --> 28:44.219
<i>She was very spiritual.</i>

28:44.306 --> 28:46.766
And when I got sick, she was there for me.

28:48.018 --> 28:52.058
<i>We had what was called</i>
<i>the Great Silence at night.</i>

28:52.147 --> 28:53.977
<i>We were not able to speak.</i>

28:54.608 --> 28:57.818
And so it was a big deal
to speak to somebody.

28:58.820 --> 29:03.830
But Cathy could see
that something was wrong with me.

29:04.660 --> 29:10.750
<i>She would just knock on the door</i>
<i>and come in and ask me if I was okay,</i>

29:11.250 --> 29:14.960
and ask me
if she could do anything for me,

29:15.045 --> 29:20.465
and she would sit on the edge of the bed
and just hold my hand and say:

29:20.550 --> 29:21.970
"You're gonna be all right."

29:23.512 --> 29:28.312
<i>She was so full of compassion</i>
<i>for everyone and everybody.</i>

29:28.600 --> 29:31.730
<i>She had compassion for the Earth,</i>

29:32.312 --> 29:35.152
and I think that's one of the reasons
we entered the convent.

29:42.155 --> 29:43.985
<i>Remember, it was the '60s.</i>

29:44.574 --> 29:47.664
<i>There was a complete change...</i>

29:48.328 --> 29:50.118
<i>in our society,</i>

29:50.414 --> 29:51.674
<i>in our culture,</i>

29:52.249 --> 29:54.539
<i>and in the Church.</i>

29:56.003 --> 30:00.673
[Patricia] <i>Vatican II was</i>
<i>a big calling together of all leadership</i>

30:00.757 --> 30:03.637
<i>at the Catholic Church at the Vatican</i>
<i>by the pope</i>

30:04.219 --> 30:06.889
to look at religious life

30:06.972 --> 30:10.392
and to look at life in the Church
and how it can be renewed.

30:11.143 --> 30:13.233
There were a huge amount of changes.

30:13.312 --> 30:16.862
Religious communities decided
to change their religious habits

30:16.940 --> 30:20.190
<i>that they had been wearing</i>
<i>for hundreds and hundreds of years.</i>

30:23.071 --> 30:26.581
[Cecelia] <i>The pope said</i>
<i>you've gotta get involved in injustice</i>

30:27.117 --> 30:30.407
to be a part of these great movements,

30:30.954 --> 30:32.374
<i>the civil rights movement,</i>

30:32.873 --> 30:34.503
<i>stopping the Vietnam War.</i>

30:34.833 --> 30:39.503
This was the role of us as religious,

30:39.880 --> 30:42.760
to be a part of changing the world.

30:46.928 --> 30:48.928
[school bell ringing]

30:54.478 --> 30:57.358
[Pat] <i>We'd be sitting there. All of</i>
<i>a sudden, you'd hear Maskell's voice:</i>

30:57.439 --> 31:00.229
<i>"I'd like to see so-and-so--"</i>
<i>And he would say their name</i>

31:00.317 --> 31:03.147
and he would have--
"Have them come to my office immediately."

31:03.945 --> 31:07.065
And then he'd click off like--
There was no if, ands, buts.

31:07.157 --> 31:08.777
You just sent them right away.

31:09.659 --> 31:12.329
<i>It was almost like he had</i>
<i>the teachers afraid of him, too.</i>

31:13.789 --> 31:17.329
[Jean] <i>I was standing at</i>
<i>Joseph Maskell's door and I knocked on it.</i>

31:17.667 --> 31:21.337
<i>And Cathy walked down</i>
<i>the corridor behind me,</i>

31:21.922 --> 31:24.802
<i>and she said, "Hi, Jeannie.</i>

31:24.883 --> 31:26.803
I didn't know you needed these services."

31:27.969 --> 31:30.809
And he opened the door,
and he looked at me,

31:31.348 --> 31:35.308
<i>and then looked over my head at her,</i>
<i>and I went into the room.</i>

31:35.727 --> 31:39.017
<i>And she said, "I didn't know</i>
<i>Jeannie needed these services."</i>

31:41.108 --> 31:44.188
And he said, "Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's been very effective, real effective."

31:46.780 --> 31:47.820
<i>And he closed the door.</i>

31:49.741 --> 31:52.451
She had the courage
to not only address me,

31:52.953 --> 31:55.163
but she also addressed him.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.786
<i>It was almost like</i>
<i>she was letting him know</i>

31:59.876 --> 32:01.246
that she was also observing.

32:03.213 --> 32:06.933
<i>I think that she was watching</i>
<i>a number of us.</i>

32:10.679 --> 32:15.019
[Kathy] <i>His sessions would be</i>
<i>supposedly guidance sessions,</i>

32:15.100 --> 32:17.230
'cause he was the counselor
for the school.

32:18.728 --> 32:21.358
<i>He started asking personal questions</i>

32:21.440 --> 32:25.320
<i>that were really something</i>
<i>you didn't wanna talk about.</i>

32:25.861 --> 32:28.571
And he says, "You're gonna have
to be punished for this,"

32:29.156 --> 32:30.566
because it was a sin.

32:31.366 --> 32:35.536
[Donna] <i>Just getting called to his office</i>
<i>was pure trauma to me.</i>

32:36.288 --> 32:40.538
I could be anywhere in the building
and hear my name overhead.

32:40.792 --> 32:45.012
And I remember,
like, one time I was in Spanish class,

32:45.255 --> 32:47.795
and he called my name again,

32:48.216 --> 32:53.306
and I, um... would start crying
and telling the teacher:

32:53.388 --> 32:54.848
"I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go."

32:54.931 --> 32:56.641
One teacher, uh, said:

32:56.725 --> 33:00.395
"I know he's weird and all,
but you have to go."

33:00.479 --> 33:01.559
[PA beeps]

33:02.230 --> 33:07.190
[Teresa] <i>When you were called over the</i>
<i>loudspeaker to report to Father Maskell,</i>

33:07.277 --> 33:10.277
a dead silence would
come over the classroom,

33:10.614 --> 33:14.914
and other, um, girls would look at you
with sad eyes.

33:15.494 --> 33:20.584
And the teachers, they-- They would just,
you know, look down or whatever.

33:20.665 --> 33:21.665
It was like...

33:22.334 --> 33:24.794
They knew something was going on.

33:26.546 --> 33:27.916
They had to.

33:30.300 --> 33:31.760
[Jean] <i>At a certain point...</i>

33:32.427 --> 33:34.677
<i>could've been more into my sophomore year,</i>

33:35.889 --> 33:37.849
<i>he would bring other people into the room.</i>

33:41.186 --> 33:44.476
<i>I would get there and there would be</i>
<i>someone sitting in a chair,</i>

33:45.023 --> 33:46.823
and I didn't know who it was.

33:49.027 --> 33:52.777
<i>There were things</i>
<i>that Maskell had gotten from me...</i>

33:53.740 --> 33:55.700
<i>about what had happened between my uncle.</i>

33:56.701 --> 33:58.621
<i>One of the things that my uncle would do</i>

33:59.162 --> 34:00.162
is, um...

34:00.247 --> 34:04.247
There was a bar that he would frequent
and he would take me in the back room.

34:04.334 --> 34:06.714
And when he would let
people do things to me there,

34:06.795 --> 34:08.165
he would be stand by the door.

34:08.922 --> 34:12.681
And I always thought that it was, uh--
Like he was my protector.

34:14.135 --> 34:17.465
<i>So, what started happening</i>
<i>was Maskell would stand by the door</i>

34:17.556 --> 34:20.136
<i>while other people</i>
<i>were doing things to me.</i>

34:21.184 --> 34:23.734
<i>So, it was as if Maskell became</i>
<i>my protector.</i>

34:28.315 --> 34:32.815
<i>One time, it was this person,</i>
<i>and he referred to him as a Brother Bob.</i>

34:35.114 --> 34:38.364
<i>I don't know that Bob was his real name...</i>

34:39.411 --> 34:44.081
<i>or if it was just a pseudonym</i>
<i>that Maskell gave him.</i>

34:46.876 --> 34:48.956
<i>Brother Bob was more like a loose cannon.</i>

34:49.920 --> 34:51.971
<i>He was violent.</i>

34:52.632 --> 34:54.302
<i>So out of control.</i>

34:55.594 --> 34:58.104
And he proceeds to rape me
from the back...

34:58.805 --> 35:00.805
and isn't pulling out.

35:01.182 --> 35:06.982
And Maskell comes over
and he, um, grabs him, and he said:

35:07.856 --> 35:09.266
"You need to be careful.

35:09.899 --> 35:13.149
This is a pup of a whole litter of pups.

35:13.820 --> 35:14.820
We can't have that."

35:16.573 --> 35:19.783
So, he's very aware
that my parents are very fertile

35:19.868 --> 35:21.578
and there was a lot of kids.

35:22.329 --> 35:26.579
And so I understand now
what he's referenced to.

35:31.921 --> 35:33.301
[inaudible]

35:38.803 --> 35:43.183
I see myself leaving the room
and I wonder if they just sat and laughed.

35:47.729 --> 35:51.149
[Kathy] <i>I talked to Sister Cathy</i>
<i>after school one day</i>

35:51.232 --> 35:53.402
<i>when we were playing guitar.</i>

35:54.694 --> 36:00.494
I told her that Father Maskell
was not very, um...

36:02.077 --> 36:03.037
religious.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.042
I think that's how I put it.

36:05.580 --> 36:07.420
And she asked me, "What do you mean?"

36:07.832 --> 36:11.212
And I told her that, um...

36:12.462 --> 36:16.012
he gets a little physical in his office.

36:16.716 --> 36:23.216
She acted like she didn't know,
but yet her face said she did know.

36:26.768 --> 36:32.148
[Teresa] <i>Joseph Maskell also was</i>
<i>the chaplain for the police department,</i>

36:32.607 --> 36:34.357
<i>for the Air National Guard,</i>

36:35.360 --> 36:37.400
<i>for Maryland State Police.</i>

36:38.488 --> 36:43.028
Maskell was covered
because his brother, Tommy,

36:43.118 --> 36:45.448
was a respected Baltimore city policeman.

36:46.037 --> 36:48.787
And just over the city county line,

36:48.873 --> 36:52.423
he was chaplain
for the Baltimore County Police,

36:52.502 --> 36:55.632
and he was close friends
with several of the police.

36:56.131 --> 36:59.091
Maskell had access to a lot of protection,

36:59.718 --> 37:04.758
and he also could maybe provide men
with what they wanted.

37:10.311 --> 37:12.901
One of the persons
who was standing in the room one time

37:12.981 --> 37:15.151
was a policeman in full uniform.

37:15.483 --> 37:18.653
Okay? If you can imagine
having to do something to a policeman,

37:18.737 --> 37:20.067
your father is a policeman.

37:21.448 --> 37:25.618
[Donna] <i>I remember them walking in</i>
<i>through a back door</i>

37:26.035 --> 37:28.365
<i>and me laying on the black couch.</i>

37:29.080 --> 37:34.040
And I could see the shirt and pants
of the officer

37:34.544 --> 37:37.384
with the very bright light
coming in the back.

37:37.464 --> 37:40.844
And that's when I heard
the police officer say:

37:40.925 --> 37:44.465
"I don't want to,"
and Maskell encouraging him.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.979
[Jean] <i> I was sitting</i>
<i>across the table from him...</i>

37:51.352 --> 37:53.352
<i>and he had a gun.</i>

37:57.108 --> 37:59.608
<i>And he's taking</i>
<i>the bullets out one by one.</i>

38:01.154 --> 38:04.704
<i>And he's saying that if my father</i>

38:05.241 --> 38:08.411
<i>ever found out that I was whoring around--</i>

38:08.953 --> 38:11.923
And then he took the gun,
he put it up to my-- my temple,

38:12.624 --> 38:17.004
and he pulled the trigger,
and he said he will do the same thing,

38:17.086 --> 38:18.626
but he'll keep the bullets in.

38:19.923 --> 38:21.133
I was terrified.

38:23.343 --> 38:25.303
<i>He used my father against me a lot.</i>

38:25.637 --> 38:28.467
<i>My father was a policeman,</i>
<i>my father carried a gun every day.</i>

38:29.808 --> 38:35.228
He was very aware of the families
that were in the school.

38:38.399 --> 38:39.689
[Kathy] <i>In my case...</i>

38:40.443 --> 38:45.743
<i>there was a lot of abuse in my life</i>
<i>prior to meeting Father Maskell.</i>

38:47.951 --> 38:50.791
<i>He would find out</i>
<i>what happened in your life,</i>

38:51.287 --> 38:54.247
find out your personal life and what...

38:55.959 --> 38:57.289
what was going on...

38:59.212 --> 39:01.092
and then he would use it against you.

39:02.674 --> 39:05.804
[Donna] <i>Did I get chosen by him</i>

39:06.302 --> 39:10.392
because he knew
I had been previously abused

39:10.473 --> 39:14.353
and the relationship
with my mother and I was broken,

39:14.435 --> 39:16.345
I would be easier prey?

39:16.437 --> 39:20.607
And, you know, I thought about that
in nursing school years later.

39:24.445 --> 39:27.865
[Lil] <i>I entered Keough in 1967,</i>

39:28.449 --> 39:30.659
<i>and I was doing exceptionally well</i>
<i>at school.</i>

39:31.369 --> 39:34.079
My father was an old-fashioned man

39:34.163 --> 39:37.133
who believed that girls
really shouldn't go to college.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.998
And so, even though
I was getting really good grades

39:40.086 --> 39:42.126
in, um, academic subjects,

39:42.213 --> 39:45.553
he wanted me to take shorthand
and business courses as well.

39:46.009 --> 39:47.009
<i>So, I did that.</i>

39:47.093 --> 39:53.393
<i>And in my junior year, I suddenly got</i>
<i>a call from the school office</i>

39:53.474 --> 39:55.104
to go see Father Maskell.

39:55.894 --> 39:59.864
<i>And he told me</i>
<i>that he needed someone he could trust,</i>

40:00.356 --> 40:07.196
<i>someone that would keep absolute</i>
<i>confidentiality about my classmates...</i>

40:08.364 --> 40:13.874
<i>that would be typing notes</i>
<i>on their psychological counseling,</i>

40:13.953 --> 40:20.673
and that I could get out of...
tests, classes, you name it.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.462
I jumped at the chance.

40:22.545 --> 40:23.835
I already had two jobs.

40:24.422 --> 40:28.682
<i>I wanted a car just so badly</i>
<i>and I was saving up for that.</i>

40:30.178 --> 40:31.348
[PA beeps]

40:31.429 --> 40:34.389
<i>I would just suddenly get a call</i>
<i>over the loudspeaker:</i>

40:34.474 --> 40:38.694
<i>"Lil Hughes, report</i>
<i>to Father Maskell's office immediately."</i>

40:39.187 --> 40:40.647
You know, and there I would go.

40:44.108 --> 40:48.398
<i>He would always give me a Coke in a...</i>
<i>a paper cup.</i>

40:54.369 --> 40:59.209
<i>So much of what I was typing</i>
<i>was almost all sexual.</i>

41:00.249 --> 41:03.629
<i>It involved incest,</i>
<i>it involved bestiality,</i>

41:03.711 --> 41:08.841
<i>it involved girls having group sex,</i>
<i>venereal disease, on and on.</i>

41:09.175 --> 41:12.925
And these are people
that I was sitting right next to in class.

41:15.181 --> 41:21.151
<i>And so many of the records</i>
<i>that I did type were about him</i>

41:21.229 --> 41:25.609
<i>helping the classmate</i>
<i>by taking them to a gynecologist.</i>

41:26.526 --> 41:28.526
I must've been so totally naive,

41:28.611 --> 41:31.161
because it didn't dawn on me
that this was something

41:31.239 --> 41:33.199
that was totally inappropriate.

41:34.867 --> 41:40.537
<i>At the time, I just was taken in</i>
<i>by his flattery, his attention,</i>

41:41.082 --> 41:45.292
and the fact that I was being, uh,
made to feel very important

41:45.378 --> 41:47.548
by someone
who was very important in the school.

41:55.221 --> 41:58.561
Joseph Maskell,
he earned a master's degree

41:58.641 --> 42:02.901
in school psychology
from Towson State University.

42:04.313 --> 42:05.573
<i>At some point after that,</i>

42:05.648 --> 42:09.858
<i>he went to Hopkins</i>
<i>for a counseling certificate,</i>

42:09.944 --> 42:11.574
<i>they called it, from Johns Hopkins.</i>

42:12.321 --> 42:18.451
Having the psychology certification
gave him access to all these young people.

42:20.872 --> 42:23.502
[Mary] <i>Maskell was heavy into psychology.</i>

42:24.083 --> 42:27.883
He knew how to manipulate people,
I think, from that.

42:27.962 --> 42:30.382
And I forgot to tell you about <i>Marnie.</i>

42:36.054 --> 42:40.104
<i>Marnie </i> was a movie that was part
of the religion class curriculum.

42:40.933 --> 42:42.143
[gasps]

42:43.102 --> 42:45.982
If it had anything to do with religion,
I don't know.

42:46.481 --> 42:50.781
The whole point of it was,
she had repressed memories.

42:50.860 --> 42:52.900
And one of them in the white suits.

42:52.987 --> 42:54.777
-Shut up, Marnie.
-No.

42:54.864 --> 42:56.124
Remember, Marnie.

42:56.199 --> 43:00.659
Sean Connery grew to love her
despite her problems.

43:00.745 --> 43:03.575
-What happened to you?
-Happened? Nothing.

43:03.664 --> 43:04.874
Nothing happened to me.

43:05.249 --> 43:07.589
I just never wanted anybody to touch me.

43:08.795 --> 43:10.585
You ever tried to talk about it?

43:10.671 --> 43:12.421
To a doctor
or somebody who could help you?

43:13.049 --> 43:17.549
It was suggestive, you know,
that maybe I have... things

43:17.637 --> 43:22.597
that I should talk to a counselor about
so I don't turn out like Marnie.

43:23.142 --> 43:28.362
<i>And eventually, he helped solve</i>
<i>what had happened in her childhood</i>

43:28.439 --> 43:29.819
<i>that she had repressed.</i>

43:29.899 --> 43:33.399
I won't let anything bad happen to you.
You're all right.

43:33.486 --> 43:36.946
[Mary] <i>And then it all came out and--</i>
<i>"Do you think I'm gonna be all right?"</i>

43:37.240 --> 43:40.620
"Yes, Marnie,
I think you're gonna be all right now.

43:40.952 --> 43:42.082
Yes, you are."

43:43.538 --> 43:46.788
<i>And then,</i>
<i>Maskell was our school psychologist,</i>

43:46.874 --> 43:51.504
<i>how convenient that he picked that movie</i>
<i>for us to go and watch.</i>

43:52.463 --> 43:54.303
[Donna] <i>He was a psychologist.</i>

43:54.841 --> 43:58.221
<i>He would hypnotize me sometimes.</i>

43:58.302 --> 44:01.562
<i>Sometimes it was</i>
<i>with a pocket watch he had.</i>

44:02.056 --> 44:06.186
There are blocks of time
when I have no idea what happened.

44:08.563 --> 44:11.443
[Lil] <i>He did do psychological tests on me.</i>

44:11.524 --> 44:12.944
<i>He did Rorschach tests.</i>

44:13.442 --> 44:16.702
<i>Every ink blot was</i>
<i>some kind of sexual thing.</i>

44:18.447 --> 44:19.777
He did hypnotize me.

44:20.324 --> 44:24.124
He-- But he presented it more
as a challenge, you know,

44:24.203 --> 44:28.173
and with me saying, "Oh, you can't,"
and he's like, "Oh, let's just see."

44:29.542 --> 44:32.212
<i>I think there was something in the Coke.</i>

44:34.213 --> 44:36.883
<i>I've never been certain</i>
<i>of what happened.</i>

44:37.300 --> 44:40.640
<i>There's so many gaps in my memory</i>

44:40.970 --> 44:45.430
of being with him,
and I only have fragments.

44:58.070 --> 45:00.870
[Jean] <i>It was my...</i>
<i>end of my sophomore year,</i>

45:00.948 --> 45:02.328
<i>so the summer was starting.</i>

45:03.284 --> 45:06.294
<i>I had gone back to the classroom</i>

45:06.370 --> 45:08.540
<i>to get a book</i>
<i>that I thought I had left there.</i>

45:09.081 --> 45:12.711
<i>And Cathy was in the front of the class</i>
<i>and she started just, kind of</i>

45:12.793 --> 45:14.843
<i>light conversation with me,</i>
<i>you know, how--</i>

45:14.921 --> 45:17.761
How was I doing, what was going on,
how did I like Keough?

45:18.925 --> 45:23.005
And I said I didn't really like it.

45:24.555 --> 45:26.265
<i>And Cathy said:</i>

45:26.849 --> 45:29.479
<i>"Oh, no. You know,</i>
<i>is there something in particular?"</i>

45:29.560 --> 45:32.610
<i>And... I said, "Yeah.</i>
<i>You know, there's different things,"</i>

45:32.688 --> 45:35.858
<i>but not really wanting to talk about it.</i>

45:36.817 --> 45:37.817
She said, "Okay."

45:37.902 --> 45:42.532
She said, "Well, how about if I just ask
and you shake your head?"

45:44.367 --> 45:45.697
And I was like, "Okay."

45:48.329 --> 45:52.959
The last time
that I was called to his office,

45:53.250 --> 45:54.920
it was after school,

45:55.461 --> 45:59.051
<i>and I was in the classroom</i>
<i>with Sister Cathy</i>

45:59.840 --> 46:01.340
<i>and my sister was with me.</i>

46:01.926 --> 46:03.086
[PA beeps]

46:03.386 --> 46:08.096
<i>Father Maskell came on the PA</i>
<i>and asked for me to come down the hall.</i>

46:09.767 --> 46:14.437
And I looked over at Sister Cathy,
and Sister Cathy looked at me.

46:14.522 --> 46:17.442
I know that it was a look of panic
on my face.

46:18.192 --> 46:22.952
And Sister Cathy told him
that I was leaving to go home

46:23.030 --> 46:24.370
<i>because it was after school.</i>

46:24.949 --> 46:31.369
My sister told me later on
that she saw a flicker of acknowledgement

46:31.455 --> 46:33.165
between me and Sister Cathy.

46:33.916 --> 46:36.706
And that's when she knew
that Sister Cathy and I

46:37.086 --> 46:39.126
knew something about Father Maskell.

46:41.424 --> 46:43.974
[Jean] <i>So, she asked me...</i>

46:44.218 --> 46:47.388
<i>was anyone making me do something</i>
<i>that I didn't wanna do.</i>

46:49.390 --> 46:52.600
And I shook my head.
I remember looking away,

46:52.685 --> 46:57.815
and I shook my head, and she--
She said, um...

47:00.651 --> 47:02.451
She said, "Is it--? Is it the priest?"

47:03.696 --> 47:07.156
And I looked up at her
and I shook my head.

47:07.742 --> 47:10.492
And she said, "Oh, dear God.

47:10.578 --> 47:11.908
I thought as much."

47:11.996 --> 47:14.206
And she then hugged me.

47:15.499 --> 47:18.919
<i>And she said,</i>
<i>"I'm gonna take care of this.</i>

47:19.545 --> 47:21.045
<i>I want you to go home</i>

47:21.130 --> 47:23.470
<i>and I want you to have</i>
<i>a wonderful summer."</i>

47:25.217 --> 47:27.337
And I told Cathy, "Okay."

47:28.471 --> 47:29.511
And I left.

47:40.524 --> 47:42.744
[Cathy on recording]
<i>Like soap bubbles are we...</i>

47:43.736 --> 47:46.526
<i>all echoing in an elastic chamber...</i>

47:48.282 --> 47:51.042
<i>always the fear of exploding to air.</i>

47:52.953 --> 47:54.163
<i>Bubbles touch.</i>

47:54.747 --> 47:56.417
<i>And, true, they break...</i>

47:58.125 --> 48:02.835
<i>but some are coupled</i>
<i>in a rainbowed joining and float,</i>

48:03.422 --> 48:07.432
<i>and are, and burst together.</i>

48:10.429 --> 48:12.519
<i>It is dedicated to Gerry.</i>

48:14.058 --> 48:15.308
[Gerry] <i>We were soul mates.</i>

48:16.936 --> 48:18.896
I was her best friend, she was mine.

48:20.898 --> 48:26.528
<i>We first got acquainted</i>
<i>in the summer of '66.</i>

48:27.446 --> 48:32.236
<i>We were corresponding in letters</i>
<i>by July of that summer.</i>

48:32.743 --> 48:36.373
And I would say that we discovered
a real genuine love

48:36.455 --> 48:37.745
for each other at that time.

48:39.583 --> 48:43.593
<i>There were very few people</i>
<i>who knew what our relationship was.</i>

48:45.297 --> 48:48.337
There was no going out somewhere
to dinner or anything like that.

48:48.425 --> 48:49.335
We couldn't do that.

48:51.679 --> 48:54.059
<i>She was facing a crossroads in her life...</i>

48:54.598 --> 49:00.058
because she was coming up
on the expiration of her temporary vows.

49:01.063 --> 49:04.943
The-- The nuns took vows
for X number of years,

49:05.818 --> 49:08.568
but then they reached the point
where they would shift

49:08.654 --> 49:11.124
taking temporary vows to take final vows,

49:11.657 --> 49:14.447
and she was facing that.

49:15.995 --> 49:19.115
<i>I was still a year away</i>
<i>from being ordained.</i>

49:20.374 --> 49:24.924
<i>We're sitting next to each other</i>
<i>outside Keough, it was a warm day.</i>

49:28.465 --> 49:30.085
And we're sitting side by side.

49:31.260 --> 49:32.430
<i>And I said to her:</i>

49:33.637 --> 49:37.347
<i>"I feel like I'm about to jump off</i>
<i>a cliff, but I'm gonna do it anyway.</i>

49:39.518 --> 49:42.228
<i>You're facing a decision</i>
<i>to go take final vows.</i>

49:42.313 --> 49:45.403
<i>A year from now, I will face a decision</i>
<i>to become a priest.</i>

49:46.942 --> 49:50.112
And I'm gonna say no to both
and ask you to be my wife."

49:51.614 --> 49:52.914
And she turned me down.

49:53.490 --> 49:54.580
She said, "No.

49:55.159 --> 49:58.619
You're meant to be a priest,
I'm meant to be a nun, so we'll go on."

50:02.833 --> 50:05.963
[Abbie] <i>In spring of 1969...</i>

50:06.962 --> 50:10.132
<i>Sister Cathy was still teaching English</i>
<i>at Keough.</i>

50:10.466 --> 50:12.336
<i>Then the summer came and we were off.</i>

50:12.885 --> 50:16.925
And when I came back in the fall of 1969
to start the senior year,

50:17.181 --> 50:19.811
she was not there
and she was no longer on the faculty.

50:20.392 --> 50:25.062
<i>And it was not real clear to us</i>
<i>what happened to her or where she went.</i>

50:29.235 --> 50:30.855
[Jean] <i>School started up again.</i>

50:31.946 --> 50:36.326
<i>Cathy wasn't there, and Maskell was.</i>

50:37.618 --> 50:40.448
<i>At one point, he called me to the office.</i>

50:41.205 --> 50:43.615
<i>It was the first time</i>
<i>that I was called to the office</i>

50:43.707 --> 50:46.167
<i>since I was back in... in my junior year.</i>

50:46.252 --> 50:49.512
He was upset because, uh, he--

50:49.588 --> 50:53.218
Someone approached him during summer
and said that they had heard that he was--

50:53.300 --> 50:56.600
Uh, he was, um... hurting the girls.

50:56.679 --> 50:59.599
He was making the girls do something
they didn't wanna do.

50:59.807 --> 51:03.137
And I'm looking at the floor,
you know, and he's, like:

51:03.227 --> 51:04.437
"That wasn't you, was it?

51:04.520 --> 51:06.610
You weren't saying that about me,
were you?"

51:06.689 --> 51:10.319
And I looked up at him and it was like,
"No, no, no, no," you know.

51:10.609 --> 51:12.819
And he said, "Wow," he said, "I hope not."

51:12.903 --> 51:15.283
He said, um,
"I think we need to reacquaint you

51:15.364 --> 51:17.574
with who the real whore is in this room."

51:19.034 --> 51:20.084
He was done, he said:

51:20.160 --> 51:22.540
"You get yourself together
and get out of here.

51:23.372 --> 51:26.502
You just remember
who's got the whoring mouth in this room."

51:29.336 --> 51:30.586
And I left the room.

51:33.048 --> 51:35.128
<i>And Cathy was nowhere to be found.</i>

51:38.095 --> 51:41.345
[Gerry] <i>Cathy's dilemma was</i>
<i>that we are not in touch</i>

51:41.890 --> 51:44.230
<i>with where these girls are coming from.</i>

51:44.310 --> 51:48.110
We don't know what it's like
to be living in the world.

51:48.188 --> 51:51.438
We're protected behind this convent thing,

51:52.026 --> 51:55.776
which limits our understanding
of what a teenage girl is going through.

51:58.991 --> 52:02.581
<i>She had gotten permission</i>
<i>from her local superiors</i>

52:02.661 --> 52:06.621
<i>to try living outside the convent</i>
<i>in an apartment in Catonsville</i>

52:06.707 --> 52:08.287
<i>with Sister Russell.</i>

52:11.628 --> 52:16.928
This is what she looked like
when she left Keough

52:17.009 --> 52:19.849
to go teach in a public school
while remaining a nun.

52:21.513 --> 52:26.443
Cathy Cesnik and Russell Phillips
were trying this experiment.

52:27.519 --> 52:31.729
<i>I understood that Mother Maurice</i>
<i>gave them permission</i>

52:32.066 --> 52:36.526
<i>to experiment with teaching</i>
<i>in public high school</i>

52:36.612 --> 52:40.162
<i>and being nuns out in the regular world.</i>

52:41.325 --> 52:46.865
I was surprised
that they were the ones engaging in this.

52:47.873 --> 52:52.843
<i>They were compliant nuns</i>
<i>following the rules all the time.</i>

52:57.883 --> 53:01.433
[Kathy]
<i>Two days before Sister Cathy disappeared,</i>

53:01.970 --> 53:04.970
<i>a friend and I went to her apartment,</i>
<i>casually,</i>

53:05.057 --> 53:06.137
<i>for a visit...</i>

53:07.434 --> 53:10.064
and we talked shortly.

53:10.145 --> 53:11.555
We didn't talk in-depth

53:11.647 --> 53:14.107
because my friend didn't know
what was going on.

53:14.692 --> 53:18.902
Sister Cathy asked me how things were,
and I knew what she meant.

53:19.446 --> 53:22.776
I was... hesitant to answer.

53:24.201 --> 53:26.791
And she says,
"It'll be taken care of, don't worry."

53:27.871 --> 53:32.001
[Gemma] <i>We know of two women,</i>
<i>Jean and Kathy Hobeck,</i>

53:32.084 --> 53:36.134
<i>who shared with Cathy</i>
<i>that they were being abused</i>

53:36.213 --> 53:37.673
<i>by Joseph Maskell.</i>

53:38.590 --> 53:42.260
<i>We also know now</i>
<i>that there is a third woman</i>

53:42.344 --> 53:45.854
<i>who, in fact,</i>
<i>was in Sister Cathy's apartment</i>

53:46.515 --> 53:48.925
<i>the night before Cathy disappeared.</i>

53:51.854 --> 53:57.234
She and her boyfriend arrived
to visit the two sisters,

53:57.317 --> 53:58.527
Cathy and Russell,

53:59.027 --> 54:02.817
<i>and she was sharing with Cathy</i>
<i>about the abuse.</i>

54:03.615 --> 54:07.905
<i>And Joseph Maskell</i>
<i>and Father Neil Magnus</i>

54:08.162 --> 54:10.712
<i>came into the apartment without knocking.</i>

54:11.623 --> 54:15.843
I asked her specifically
what expressions were on their faces,

54:16.128 --> 54:20.918
and she said Maskell was furious,
Magnus looked dumb.

54:21.425 --> 54:25.295
Sister Cathy sent her out,
and her boyfriend out of the apartment.

54:26.430 --> 54:29.350
<i>The next day, when she went to school,</i>

54:30.142 --> 54:33.232
<i>he called her into his office and said:</i>

54:34.062 --> 54:39.822
"If you say anything,
I'll kill both of you and your families."

54:40.986 --> 54:42.396
She never said anything.

54:42.488 --> 54:45.988
Later that day is when Cathy disappeared.

54:46.992 --> 54:50.582
<i>This woman,</i>
<i>who has chosen to remain anonymous,</i>

54:50.662 --> 54:53.582
<i>has lived with fear all her life.</i>

55:05.135 --> 55:07.255
[Gerry]
<i>Cathy and I were supposed to get together</i>

55:08.263 --> 55:10.223
<i>the day after she was actually killed.</i>

55:13.101 --> 55:16.271
<i>She said there was something serious</i>
<i>she wanted to talk to me about.</i>

55:18.607 --> 55:22.437
<i>I thought she might--</i>
<i>Wanted to reopen the question</i>

55:22.528 --> 55:24.818
<i>of whether or not</i>
<i>we should leave and get married.</i>

55:26.365 --> 55:30.945
But I look back now and say,
if at that time she was aware...

55:32.162 --> 55:36.212
of priests sexually abusing the girls
at Archbishop Keough,

55:37.042 --> 55:39.212
then maybe that's what she wanted
to talk about.

55:40.254 --> 55:42.764
Would've been a hell of a conversation,
I'll tell you.

55:44.174 --> 55:45.184
But it never happened.

55:50.264 --> 55:52.684
[Jean] <i>When I was called to the room,</i>
<i>it was after school...</i>

55:53.225 --> 55:54.595
<i>and he was frantic.</i>

55:55.477 --> 55:57.727
He said, "I know you're close
with Sister Cathy--

55:57.813 --> 56:00.733
And I just-- I wanted to let you know
that she's missing."

56:00.816 --> 56:02.646
And he said, "But I know where she is."

56:02.985 --> 56:06.195
And I was like, "What do you mean
you know--? You know where she is?"

56:06.280 --> 56:09.030
He said, "I know where she is.
Want me to take you to her?"

56:09.283 --> 56:10.583
And I was like, "Yes."

56:11.868 --> 56:13.748
<i>We leave his room.</i>

56:13.829 --> 56:16.789
<i>I remember walking through the corridor</i>
<i>of the school...</i>

56:18.000 --> 56:20.040
<i>and we go out, and we get in a car.</i>

56:21.420 --> 56:25.300
<i>There's two unbelievable emotions</i>
<i>that are going on at the same time.</i>

56:25.882 --> 56:28.642
<i>One was total shock.</i>
<i>"What do you mean she's missing?"</i>

56:28.719 --> 56:30.639
Like, it hit me like a--
Like, in the stomach.

56:32.389 --> 56:35.309
<i>And the other was,</i>
<i>he knew where she was, relief.</i>

56:35.934 --> 56:37.604
<i>And I just knew I needed to see her.</i>

56:40.314 --> 56:44.574
<i>We pull up into this kind of a--</i>
<i>It was a bit like a barren area.</i>

56:49.615 --> 56:52.735
<i>There was grass, and dirt, and, um...</i>

56:52.826 --> 56:54.786
<i>And I'm thinking,</i>
<i>"What is she doing here?"</i>

56:55.370 --> 56:56.500
<i>And I'm following him.</i>

56:57.664 --> 56:59.794
<i>And he moved over...</i>

57:01.793 --> 57:04.383
<i>and there's a clump on the ground</i>
<i>and I knew it was her.</i>

57:09.468 --> 57:12.098
Before I knew it,
I was kneeling down next to her.

57:12.429 --> 57:14.469
And there were maggots in her face.

57:14.723 --> 57:18.063
And I was wiping her face and just saying:

57:18.143 --> 57:20.903
"Please help me. Please help me.
Please help me. Please help me."

57:23.941 --> 57:25.981
<i>And I'm, like, looking at my hands...</i>

57:29.029 --> 57:30.949
and he came down real close...

57:34.242 --> 57:35.162
and he said:

57:38.997 --> 57:42.207
"Do you see what happens
when you say bad things about people?"
