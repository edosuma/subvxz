WEBVTT

01:17.250 --> 01:18.375
Mom?

01:21.166 --> 01:22.000
Mads?

01:26.833 --> 01:28.000
Who are you?

01:29.166 --> 01:30.416
Where are my parents?

01:39.666 --> 01:42.041
-Who are you?
-Do you know where he is?

01:42.833 --> 01:45.083
-Do you know where Mads is?
-You're hurting me.

01:45.166 --> 01:47.250
What are you doing here?
Say something.

01:51.916 --> 01:54.916
When is he coming back?

03:34.791 --> 03:39.458
PAST AND PRESENT

03:49.125 --> 03:51.416
Ines, can you do
the night shift today too?

03:51.500 --> 03:54.708
Mrs. SchÃ¼ttler's daughter has a fever
and I have to take Benni to soccer.

03:55.250 --> 03:57.208
-Since you have no...
-No family.

03:58.125 --> 04:01.250
-That's not what I meant.
-It's not a problem.

04:01.333 --> 04:04.083
Thanks.
And please, don't tell Dr. Reimann?

04:09.250 --> 04:11.833
-Mum's the word.
-Thanks.

04:55.916 --> 04:57.083
The news.

04:59.625 --> 05:02.000
November 5, 1986.

05:02.416 --> 05:05.458
After the mysterious disappearance
of an 11-year-old boy

05:05.541 --> 05:08.083
in Winden over four weeks ago,

05:08.166 --> 05:11.041
criticism of local investigators
is growing ever louder.

05:11.125 --> 05:14.208
The circumstances
of the case are puzzling.

05:14.291 --> 05:16.583
Despite an extensive search,

05:16.666 --> 05:20.250
Winden Police have been unable to find
a single piece of useful evidence.

05:20.333 --> 05:24.666
The police are therefore continuing to ask
for the public's assistance.

05:24.750 --> 05:27.666
- The chemical plant fire in Switzerland...
-Tiedemann.

05:27.750 --> 05:31.000
- ...is doing damage to local waterways.
-Where?

05:31.791 --> 05:35.875
- Toxic chemicals are entering the Rhine...
-I'm on my way.

05:39.625 --> 05:41.208
In times like these...

05:42.208 --> 05:43.041
one must...

05:44.041 --> 05:46.833
face one's own fears.

05:46.916 --> 05:48.416
Because the future...

05:52.250 --> 05:54.166
the future belongs to the bold.

05:55.125 --> 05:58.208
Not to the doubters,
those forever stuck in the past.

06:01.750 --> 06:05.208
Would you take a look at yourself?
You can't go to school like this.

06:05.291 --> 06:07.708
Sometimes I think you have no idea
what it is I do.

06:09.083 --> 06:12.666
Food, clothes, fencing classes.
Who pays for all of that?

06:14.250 --> 06:16.625
And you can't even bother
combing your hair.

06:17.583 --> 06:20.625
Look at yourself.
You look like a limp dishrag.

06:22.166 --> 06:24.291
Hey, Regina, I'm talking to you.

06:25.250 --> 06:27.916
This is a huge deal for me,
and I won't let you spoil it.

06:32.333 --> 06:36.458
The board's decision to entrust this post
to a woman for the first time...

07:12.083 --> 07:16.000
MISSING
MADS NIELSEN

07:17.291 --> 07:18.375
It's awesome.

07:18.916 --> 07:20.833
-Know what the song's about?
-No.

07:20.916 --> 07:24.041
A man who kidnaps a girl
and takes her to the forest,

07:24.125 --> 07:27.375
just because she's wearing red lipstick.
In the end he kills her.

07:27.458 --> 07:28.708
That's heavy.

07:29.083 --> 07:31.750
My dad says lipstick
is only for prostitutes.

07:31.833 --> 07:34.708
Anyway, I like Nino D'Angelo
way more than Falco.

07:34.791 --> 07:37.083
Hannah, you're as square as they come.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.208
Come on, Katharina. Don't be so nasty.

07:44.250 --> 07:47.458
What are you looking at?
Weren't you at Ulrich's place earlier?

07:47.916 --> 07:48.916
Are you new here?

07:50.541 --> 07:51.750
I...

07:51.833 --> 07:53.208
I'm looking for my mom.

07:53.708 --> 07:55.125
This isn't kindergarten.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.500
She's the principal here.

07:56.791 --> 07:57.708
Mr. Hubert?

07:58.708 --> 08:01.375
He may be a fag,
but he's certainly not a woman.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.125
Isn't this Winden?

08:06.791 --> 08:08.583
Aren't you a bit young to drop acid?

08:09.333 --> 08:11.125
You guys got history now?

08:48.041 --> 08:50.041
-Morning, Claudia.
-Morning.

08:50.583 --> 08:52.750
-Your first day as boss.
-Yes.

08:53.291 --> 08:57.041
My dad told me
the board voted unanimously for you.

08:58.208 --> 08:59.125
I wanted...

09:00.916 --> 09:02.750
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

09:02.833 --> 09:05.666
I always knew
something would become of you.

09:05.750 --> 09:07.833
-Oh, Helge.
-And I have...

09:10.750 --> 09:11.666
A present for you.

09:16.875 --> 09:17.791
It's a book.

09:19.583 --> 09:20.541
Thanks.

09:25.416 --> 09:28.166
Well, I'm running late.
I have to get going.

09:31.208 --> 09:33.041
We're all behind you, Cl...

09:42.916 --> 09:46.958
I came just before six to feed the animals
and found this.

09:50.875 --> 09:52.083
Maybe a wolf?

09:55.041 --> 09:57.291
No bite marks. Nothing.

10:00.875 --> 10:01.791
Poisoned?

10:03.291 --> 10:05.083
Yesterday they were lively as can be.

10:05.166 --> 10:07.666
First the thing with the boy,
and now this.

10:07.750 --> 10:09.791
Such things didn't use to happen here.

10:10.166 --> 10:12.666
Who would just kill 33 sheep?

10:17.000 --> 10:18.833
"Be on guard! Be alert!

10:20.083 --> 10:22.541
You do not know
when that time will come."

10:25.166 --> 10:27.875
The Gospel of Mark, 13:33.

10:30.041 --> 10:32.208
Didn't know you were a churchgoer.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.708
The parish has a new priest.
A good man.

10:50.375 --> 10:51.416
Mrs. Tiedemann.

10:51.833 --> 10:52.750
Mrs. Tiedemann,

10:52.833 --> 10:56.250
Tronte Nielsen from the paper is here,
for the interview.

10:57.541 --> 11:01.375
And here are the figures
from 1986 and 1985, as you requested.

11:04.541 --> 11:06.125
They weren't easy to get a hold of.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.458
And congratulations again.

11:10.166 --> 11:12.833
I still can't believe
we have a woman as boss.

11:15.083 --> 11:17.500
Are you sure these are the right figures?

11:17.833 --> 11:18.666
Yes.

11:42.041 --> 11:44.000
REPORT:
33 DEAD SHEEP

11:51.416 --> 11:52.791
What are you doing here?

11:53.833 --> 11:54.833
I...

11:55.583 --> 11:57.000
I'm looking for my dad.

12:00.541 --> 12:01.708
What's his name?

12:02.833 --> 12:04.083
Ulrich Nielsen.

12:04.750 --> 12:07.541
Ulrich Nielsen? The Ulrich Nielsen?

12:08.291 --> 12:10.958
-Doesn't he work here?
-No.

12:11.791 --> 12:13.625
And I'm certain he never will.

12:17.916 --> 12:21.458
Oh, so this is a joke?
Was this Ulrich's dumb idea?

12:33.125 --> 12:34.625
Did he do this?

12:36.583 --> 12:38.291
Did Ulrich do this?

12:41.083 --> 12:43.666
-What's your name?
-Mikkel.

12:44.041 --> 12:45.583
-Last name?
-Nielsen.

12:46.250 --> 12:48.125
I'm Ulrich's son.

12:49.958 --> 12:52.166
Now tell me your parents' real names

12:52.250 --> 12:54.166
and I'll take you home.

12:55.583 --> 12:56.875
What's the date?

12:57.458 --> 12:59.000
5th of November.

12:59.708 --> 13:00.875
What year?

13:01.541 --> 13:03.500
1986.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.875
1986.

13:21.708 --> 13:22.791
Tiedemann.

13:23.500 --> 13:25.000
I have an injured boy here.

13:25.416 --> 13:27.541
Can one of you come pick him up?

13:28.500 --> 13:29.416
Thanks.

13:32.666 --> 13:37.125
Someone will be coming
to pick you up and take care of that.

13:37.208 --> 13:40.416
In the meantime I'll take care of Ulrich.

13:43.666 --> 13:45.208
He won't hurt you again.

13:45.666 --> 13:47.083
I promise.

14:19.666 --> 14:22.458
An interview? Are you serious, Tronte?

14:23.916 --> 14:25.291
People are interested.

14:26.083 --> 14:28.333
A woman taking charge
of the nuclear power plant.

14:28.416 --> 14:30.583
That's progressive, even for the '80s.

14:30.666 --> 14:35.208
I have no time for this today.
Make a new appointment with my secretary.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.083
Hey!

14:39.958 --> 14:40.875
I miss you.

14:45.458 --> 14:47.291
I thought we talked about this.

14:48.916 --> 14:51.041
You can't just leave me hanging like this.

14:51.125 --> 14:52.458
Claudia, I need you!

14:53.333 --> 14:55.333
I'm going stir crazy at home.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.333
-Jana loses it more and more and I...
-I want you to go now.

15:01.083 --> 15:02.125
Tonight?

15:04.166 --> 15:05.375
Please.

15:06.375 --> 15:07.416
Maybe.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.541
The number you have dialed
is not in service.

15:28.625 --> 15:30.583
Please call information.

15:59.833 --> 16:02.583
MISSING PERSON'S REPORT
MADS NIELSEN

16:06.708 --> 16:09.083
WINDEN BOY (12)
VANISHES WITHOUT A TRACE

16:14.416 --> 16:16.916
MADS NIELSEN (12) MISSING
SINCE LAST WEEK

16:41.208 --> 16:42.375
Hello.

16:49.416 --> 16:50.708
I'm Nurse Ines.

16:51.291 --> 16:53.333
But you can just call me Ines.

16:59.625 --> 17:01.666
I'll take you to the hospital now.

17:02.750 --> 17:04.875
We'll take a look at your arm, okay?

17:07.166 --> 17:09.750
Then I'll bring you home safe and sound.

17:48.750 --> 17:49.875
Hello?

17:53.791 --> 17:54.708
Hello!

18:02.041 --> 18:02.916
Hello?

18:41.291 --> 18:43.000
What are you doing here?

18:50.750 --> 18:52.208
Why do you listen to such stuff?

18:55.875 --> 18:57.541
The boy you sent...

18:57.750 --> 19:00.541
-Do you think that's funny?
-What boy?

19:00.708 --> 19:03.000
Don't think you'll get away with this.

19:08.125 --> 19:11.125
-Have we been drinking again?
-Beg your pardon?

19:11.375 --> 19:14.708
-I asked if you've been drinking again?
-Who do you think you are?

19:15.625 --> 19:19.833
I want us to find your brother
as badly as you do.

19:36.583 --> 19:39.458
-What's this?
-A hoof. That's obvious.

19:40.625 --> 19:43.000
-Did you do that on the pasture?
-What pasture?

19:43.083 --> 19:44.708
Did you kill the sheep?

19:44.791 --> 19:47.000
If you'd stop drinking your brain to mush,

19:48.708 --> 19:50.625
then Mads might be back by now.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.291
Mr. Tiedemann?

19:57.041 --> 19:59.625
-The door was open.
-Because of Mads.

20:00.291 --> 20:01.708
He forgot his key.

20:02.791 --> 20:06.000
Chief Inspector Tiedemann
wants to update you on the investigation.

20:06.291 --> 20:08.000
They've got new findings.

20:10.541 --> 20:12.458
Exactly. You have nothing.

20:13.166 --> 20:14.875
Now kindly piss off!

20:57.916 --> 20:59.708
Everything's in working order.

21:00.833 --> 21:02.250
How did this happen?

21:07.958 --> 21:10.375
And you still won't tell us your name?

21:18.791 --> 21:20.875
Nurse Ines will bandage you up, okay?

21:21.708 --> 21:22.958
Then you can go back home.

21:31.291 --> 21:33.625
RECORD OF PATIENT ADMISSION

22:04.000 --> 22:04.875
Don't cry.

22:05.916 --> 22:07.666
Don't cry. Everything will be okay.

22:31.625 --> 22:33.875
Bernd? I have to talk to you.

22:40.541 --> 22:42.291
Were you trying to slip this past me?

22:42.458 --> 22:45.041
I said I need to know
if there are skeletons in the closet.

22:46.666 --> 22:51.208
There are things that are worth knowing
and things worth not knowing,

22:51.291 --> 22:53.750
because you can't change them anyway.

22:55.125 --> 22:56.250
What is this?

22:57.083 --> 22:59.625
These are nothing like
the reported figures. Here.

23:02.166 --> 23:03.416
And here.

23:04.708 --> 23:08.041
Everywhere.
It's been like that for three months now.

23:08.541 --> 23:11.958
Do you know
what has changed since Chernobyl?

23:13.541 --> 23:17.458
People have lost faith.
In us, in nuclear power.

23:17.708 --> 23:19.250
They saw the images.

23:20.583 --> 23:23.083
And they can't
get them out of their heads.

23:24.375 --> 23:28.125
But fear is the worst enemy of progress.

23:32.958 --> 23:34.041
So?

23:36.208 --> 23:39.541
How many people around here
rely on this plant for their livelihood?

23:42.875 --> 23:46.750
-We have 612 employees, excluding...
-Everyone!

23:47.166 --> 23:49.291
And when you take over this job tomorrow,

23:49.375 --> 23:52.541
you'll be taking on responsibility
for the nuclear power plant,

23:52.625 --> 23:55.916
but you'll also be taking responsibility
for the entire town.

23:57.625 --> 24:00.208
And now tell me
I wasn't wrong about you.

24:09.083 --> 24:11.875
All the more reason
for me to know just what this means.

24:49.416 --> 24:52.291
And? Everything A-okay with your daughter?

24:53.541 --> 24:55.500
Yes, everything's A-okay.

24:58.458 --> 24:59.875
It's a big deal.

25:00.416 --> 25:02.958
A woman taking charge of the power plant.

25:03.916 --> 25:05.041
Sure it is.

25:06.916 --> 25:09.291
-And your granddaughter?
-Regina?

25:10.250 --> 25:11.625
She's good too.

25:14.208 --> 25:16.041
So were they poisoned?

25:16.541 --> 25:17.666
Hardly.

25:18.291 --> 25:20.208
All signs point to sudden cardiac arrest.

25:20.583 --> 25:22.333
-Cardiac arrest?
-Yes.

25:22.416 --> 25:23.916
All 33?

25:24.000 --> 25:27.458
It's common with sheep.
They're very sensitive creatures.

25:27.833 --> 25:29.750
If a few start to panic,

25:29.833 --> 25:31.958
the entire herd freaks out.

25:32.041 --> 25:34.166
It's a vicious cycle.
They just drop dead.

25:35.250 --> 25:36.666
Like flies.

25:37.583 --> 25:40.916
-And what could cause such a panic?
-All kinds of things.

25:43.083 --> 25:44.166
A person?

25:44.500 --> 25:45.791
A single person?

25:46.666 --> 25:50.625
Unless he's Freddy Krueger,
he'd have his work cut out for him.

25:53.208 --> 25:55.666
Was one of the sheep...

25:57.666 --> 26:00.833
I mean, was one of them missing a hoof?

26:02.958 --> 26:03.833
No.

26:04.375 --> 26:06.541
They're all as God created them.

26:09.458 --> 26:11.541
Do you know anything about Satanists?

26:13.083 --> 26:14.791
You think Satanists did this?

26:16.500 --> 26:20.708
As far as I know,
they make a big show of it all.

26:20.791 --> 26:22.791
You'd find traces on the pasture.

26:26.750 --> 26:28.000
Very strange.

26:28.750 --> 26:29.750
Look here.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.333
The eardrums are ruptured.

26:34.416 --> 26:36.125
On both sides.

26:36.500 --> 26:37.666
Strange.

26:40.041 --> 26:44.541
Coming to our party this weekend?
My wife's making Yugoslavian meatballs.

26:45.875 --> 26:48.750
Spicy as hell, but also tasty as hell.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.875
What we know is a drop,

27:21.958 --> 27:23.166
what we don't know

27:23.791 --> 27:25.250
is an ocean.

28:21.208 --> 28:23.916
Won't you tell me
your name and where you live?

28:28.625 --> 28:30.166
Don't you want to go home?

28:38.166 --> 28:41.166
If something happened at home...

28:43.791 --> 28:45.125
you can stay here for now.

28:55.833 --> 28:58.000
If you want to talk, I'm here.

28:59.916 --> 29:01.916
I'm on the night shift too.

29:08.375 --> 29:10.041
Here, something to read.

29:13.625 --> 29:14.750
I come from the future.

29:17.458 --> 29:18.916
What did you say?

29:22.166 --> 29:24.041
I come from the future.

30:37.125 --> 30:38.291
Mom?

30:42.458 --> 30:43.666
Hi, it's Mom.

30:43.750 --> 30:46.125
If you're hearing this, heat up a pizza.

30:46.208 --> 30:49.208
I'm coming later.
I have something to take care of.

33:46.791 --> 33:49.125
-Hey, Hannah!
-Hey, Ulrich.

34:06.291 --> 34:07.750
Is this the Apocalypse?

34:10.291 --> 34:11.541
A bit disappointing.

34:11.833 --> 34:13.666
I imagined it being louder.

34:13.750 --> 34:14.708
More glaring.

35:06.833 --> 35:08.875
If the world ended today,

35:08.958 --> 35:10.250
and everything started anew,

35:10.875 --> 35:12.208
what would you wish for?

35:12.541 --> 35:13.458
Easy.

35:14.666 --> 35:16.000
A world without Winden.

35:22.750 --> 35:24.208
To a world without Winden.

35:24.625 --> 35:26.125
To a world without Winden.

35:39.500 --> 35:41.541
I don't think Winden
is going to give up that easily.

35:43.250 --> 35:45.458
Well, maybe next time.

36:59.833 --> 37:03.666
A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME

40:05.666 --> 40:06.583
Hello?

40:08.333 --> 40:10.333
Hello!

40:17.708 --> 40:19.208
Help!

40:19.666 --> 40:21.000
Help!

40:32.041 --> 40:32.875
Hello?

40:52.875 --> 40:53.708
Hello?

40:54.916 --> 40:55.791
Anybody there?

40:58.083 --> 40:58.916
Mikkel?

41:01.958 --> 41:03.000
Mikkel?

45:04.541 --> 45:08.541
