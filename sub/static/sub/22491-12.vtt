00:18.852 --> 00:20.683
It's alive!

00:41.107 --> 00:45.066
Mom! I found dad!

00:46.179 --> 00:48.443
The United States Navy...

00:48.481 --> 00:51.177
battling a new foe,
low recruitment.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.617
So remember "don't ask, don't tell?"

00:53.653 --> 00:57.145
Now we're more "don't ask"
than ever before.

00:57.190 --> 01:01.923
When they write your life story
will anyone want to read it?

01:01.961 --> 01:03.622
Then put a chapter in there...

01:03.663 --> 01:06.461
about having sex
with a man on a submarine.

01:06.499 --> 01:07.864
That would be a neat book.

01:09.202 --> 01:10.635
The Navy.

01:11.037 --> 01:13.471
Kneel before Zod!

01:13.506 --> 01:16.600
Lay down on your backs before Zod.

01:16.643 --> 01:18.975
Now, using your lower abdominals...

01:19.012 --> 01:22.175
raise your legs
and hold on a five-count before Zod.

01:22.215 --> 01:25.241
One before Zod,
two before Zod...

01:25.285 --> 01:26.809
three before Zod...

01:26.853 --> 01:30.812
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.

01:30.857 --> 01:32.449
There's no place like...

01:34.627 --> 01:38.688
Oh, crap!
This isn't what I meant.

01:38.731 --> 01:42.724
Well, tan my hide.
Look who's come home!

01:42.769 --> 01:46.535
Dwayne, get on out here
and see what the cat drug in.

01:46.573 --> 01:47.904
Why, Rita, I...

01:50.643 --> 01:55.103
My little girl
has finally come back to me.

01:56.883 --> 01:58.942
You look good, child.

01:58.985 --> 02:03.479
There's no place like
Auntie Em and Uncle Henry's.

02:03.523 --> 02:07.186
Coming this fall from the creators of Monk,
everyone's parents' favorite...

02:07.227 --> 02:09.592
obsessive-compulsive detective
comes Cork...

02:09.628 --> 02:12.154
America's first
mentally challenged crime sleuth.

02:12.198 --> 02:13.893
It's Anica Dorsey, the bank teller.

02:13.933 --> 02:17.391
We're all out of leads, Cork.
What do you make of the situation?

02:17.437 --> 02:21.134
I'm a tornado!
I'm a tornado!

02:23.877 --> 02:26.971
It's a wedding band.
This young man just found our first clue.

02:27.013 --> 02:29.675
- Good job, Cork.
- No more gym class.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.952
What is it, Cork?

02:32.986 --> 02:34.544
Is it a widow and her boyfriend...

02:34.587 --> 02:37.385
trying to cash in
on her late husband's insurance policy?

02:37.423 --> 02:39.516
Is it a gang of old poker buddies...

02:39.559 --> 02:43.086
who decided to knock over a casino
for one last shot at fortune?

02:44.130 --> 02:46.496
- Do you have to go number-one?
- Yeah!

02:46.533 --> 02:50.299
OK. Take my hand.
No more soda for you today, OK?

02:52.505 --> 02:54.200
He's getting away!

02:55.175 --> 02:57.268
- You want to go faster, Cork?
- OK.

03:04.484 --> 03:07.453
Loud noises. No noises.

03:07.487 --> 03:09.887
You'll never take me alive, Cork!
One move...

03:09.923 --> 03:14.053
and your precious volunteer big sister
is gonna have a bullet in her head!

03:14.093 --> 03:16.391
- Cork, do something!
- Boobies.

03:17.597 --> 03:20.862
Cork, quick! The bad man
took your Stretch Armstrong!

03:20.900 --> 03:23.164
No!

03:25.672 --> 03:26.696
Mine! Mine!

03:27.473 --> 03:29.270
Mine! Mine!

03:29.309 --> 03:32.767
Cork, that's enough.
Cork, that's enough. Cork.

03:35.281 --> 03:38.273
Cork, thanks
to your unflappable enthusiasm...

03:38.318 --> 03:42.345
and surprisingly handy capable strengths,
this city owes you a great debt.

03:42.388 --> 03:47.121
As a token of our gratitude, you may
now pick out one toy at the toy store.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.593
I am spaghetti.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.125
Release the Kraken!

04:08.381 --> 04:11.441
I'm free. I'm free!

04:11.484 --> 04:14.817
Oh, my God!
It's all so beautiful.

04:14.854 --> 04:18.221
I honestly thought
I would never get out.

04:23.863 --> 04:25.990
¤ Heartbreak ¤

04:26.032 --> 04:29.991
¤ In the morning
there's heartbreak ¤

04:30.036 --> 04:33.938
¤ My kittens have left me ¤

04:33.973 --> 04:38.706
¤ And the flowers are dead ¤

04:38.745 --> 04:43.773
¤ I hear laughter, but never for me ¤

04:43.816 --> 04:46.649
¤ No, I'm alone ¤

04:46.686 --> 04:50.417
¤ Dust and refuse ¤

04:50.456 --> 04:53.687
¤ Fills my soul ¤

04:53.726 --> 04:56.217
¤ Sorrow ¤

04:56.262 --> 05:00.392
¤ Every moment is torment ¤

05:00.433 --> 05:03.664
¤ I can't recall sunshine ¤

05:03.703 --> 05:08.333
¤ And all colors are gray ¤

05:08.374 --> 05:11.866
¤ In the mirror ¤

05:11.911 --> 05:16.177
¤ I beg for release
and hear its sweet call ¤

05:16.215 --> 05:22.154
¤ When the gates open,
I walk slowly in ¤

05:22.188 --> 05:24.349
It's just like Andy always told me.

05:24.390 --> 05:26.824
Get busy dying, or get Kraken.

05:28.461 --> 05:30.326
I got no brakes!

05:35.234 --> 05:37.202
¤ Faces filled with joy and cheer ¤

05:37.236 --> 05:39.500
¤ What a magical time of year ¤

05:39.539 --> 05:43.703
¤ Howdy ho
it's Weasel Stomping Day ¤

05:43.743 --> 05:45.904
¤ Now put your Viking helmet on ¤

05:45.945 --> 05:48.004
¤ Spread that mayonnaise on the lawn ¤

05:48.047 --> 05:51.016
¤ Don't you know
it's Weasel Stomping Day? ¤

05:51.050 --> 05:52.847
¤ Weasel stomping day ¤

05:52.885 --> 05:54.750
¤ All the little girls and boys ¤

05:54.787 --> 05:56.846
¤ Love that wonderful
crunching noise ¤

05:56.889 --> 05:58.686
¤ You'll know what this day's about ¤

05:58.725 --> 06:00.818
¤ When you stomp
a weasel's guts right out ¤

06:00.860 --> 06:03.021
¤ So come along and have a laugh ¤

06:03.062 --> 06:05.462
¤ Stomp their weasely spines in half ¤

06:05.498 --> 06:09.662
¤ Grab your boots
and stomp your cares away ¤

06:09.702 --> 06:13.331
¤ Hip hip hooray,
it's Weasel Stomping Day ¤

06:31.424 --> 06:33.119
¤ People up and down the street ¤

06:33.159 --> 06:35.389
¤ Crushing weasels
beneath their feet ¤

06:35.428 --> 06:37.487
¤ Why we do it, who can say? ¤

06:37.530 --> 06:39.555
¤ But it's such a festive holiday ¤

06:39.599 --> 06:41.897
¤ So let the stomping fun begin ¤

06:41.934 --> 06:44.129
¤ Bash their weasely skulls right in ¤

06:44.170 --> 06:48.334
¤ It's tradition, that makes it OK ¤

06:48.374 --> 06:50.399
¤ Hey, everyone, it's Weasel Stomping ¤

06:50.443 --> 06:52.536
¤ We'll have some fun
on Weasel Stomping ¤

06:52.578 --> 06:56.537
¤ Put down your gun,
it's Weasel Stomping Day ¤

06:56.582 --> 07:01.349
¤ Hip hip hooray,
it's Weasel Stomping Day ¤

07:01.387 --> 07:02.877
¤ Weasel Stomping Day ¤

07:04.123 --> 07:08.116
Well, here we are, face to face.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.958
Starlight, star bright...

07:09.996 --> 07:11.987
first star I see tonight.

07:12.031 --> 07:14.465
I wish I may, I wish I might...

07:14.500 --> 07:17.435
have this wish
I wish tonight.

07:17.470 --> 07:18.767
I wish...

07:22.375 --> 07:23.706
Holy crap!

07:25.578 --> 07:26.840
I got to tell Oscar.

07:28.414 --> 07:29.608
Oscar!

07:29.649 --> 07:31.139
Oscar! Oscar!

07:33.085 --> 07:35.576
Oscar, it's me, Kevin.

07:35.621 --> 07:39.057
- What happened?
- I made a wish on that star.

07:43.262 --> 07:45.787
Dude, we got to tell Jimmy.

07:45.832 --> 07:48.699
Dudes, we've got to tell Louis.

07:48.734 --> 07:51.202
Louis. Hey, Louis.

07:52.605 --> 07:55.005
Make a wish. It'll come true.

07:57.009 --> 08:00.968
A giant squid? You idiot!
We're not even near water.

08:01.013 --> 08:04.414
Crap! Sorry, guys.

08:05.585 --> 08:07.177
Let's go tell Timmy.

08:08.654 --> 08:12.590
Timmy! Hey, Timmy!
Use your laser cannon to wake him up.

08:12.625 --> 08:14.058
I have a laser cannon?

08:14.093 --> 08:17.654
All giant robots
have laser cannons.

08:21.400 --> 08:24.699
Holy crap!
I have a laser cannon!

08:24.737 --> 08:27.604
Timmy! Timmy!
Make a wish, and it'll come true.

08:29.475 --> 08:32.000
- Timmy?!
- Let's go get Zach.

08:32.044 --> 08:34.740
Zach, wake up!
Wake up, Zach!

08:34.780 --> 08:36.975
Make a wish, and it'll come true.

08:40.886 --> 08:44.516
Fucking jerks!
It's 3:00 in the morning.

08:44.557 --> 08:48.459
- Want to play doctor?
- I don't have insurance.

08:49.929 --> 08:51.191
Report, Mr. Scott.

08:51.230 --> 08:55.360
Captain, somebody
traded all our dilithium crystals...

08:55.401 --> 08:58.165
for pornographic holograms.

09:00.773 --> 09:02.502
- And?
- With no power...

09:02.542 --> 09:05.170
all life support
on the ship is about to fail.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.508
And?

09:06.546 --> 09:09.310
Our only hope
is to beam down to the nearest planet...

09:09.348 --> 09:12.374
but there is only enough power
to send five people.

09:12.418 --> 09:15.319
- I can't do no more.
- Captain, logic dictates...

09:15.354 --> 09:18.482
that each of the 433 crew members...

09:18.524 --> 09:19.752
Where did Kirk go?

09:20.793 --> 09:22.226
Oh, no, he didn't.

09:22.828 --> 09:24.159
No fair, Jim!

09:28.301 --> 09:31.702
Now there's only enough power
for four of us to beam out!

09:31.737 --> 09:34.137
I'm a doctor.
I have to go.

09:38.711 --> 09:40.941
I have a vagina.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.307
A vagina could prove quite useful.

09:45.618 --> 09:49.884
I'm Toby, the redshirt.
You need a redshirt. You just do.

09:49.922 --> 09:52.186
- Quite logical.
- Sure.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.751
Only one of us can go, old friend.

09:56.796 --> 10:01.028
We shall handle this the only logical way.
What the hell is that?!

10:01.067 --> 10:04.969
Did you just try
the Vulcan nerve pinch on me?

10:05.004 --> 10:06.665
No.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.765
My eye!

10:21.087 --> 10:24.716
It looks like we got some sort
of Donner Party situation up in here.

10:24.757 --> 10:27.089
Damn it, Jim.
I'm a doctor, not a...

10:27.126 --> 10:29.993
A cannibal.
Yes, we know. We know.

10:30.029 --> 10:32.259
Am I really that predictable?

10:32.298 --> 10:33.993
Chain of command, people.

10:34.033 --> 10:36.228
So I guess we start by eating...

10:36.268 --> 10:37.929
Let's see.

10:38.804 --> 10:39.998
Hell, no!

10:40.039 --> 10:42.735
You know what? Fuck all y'all.

10:42.775 --> 10:45.437
- It is your duty.
- Screw that!

10:45.478 --> 10:48.538
On behalf of all the redshirts
that fell before me...

10:48.581 --> 10:52.415
it makes me very, very proud
to speak the following sentence.

10:55.054 --> 10:57.147
I'm the only one
that brought a gun.

11:04.630 --> 11:06.222
That's good ham.
