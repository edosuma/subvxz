much involved in a cover shoot.

a new writer to carry the torch.

a canvas,

02:03.767 --> 02:05.133
Why is that a problem?

02:12.600 --> 02:14.467
- Well, how about
not go out with him at all?

02:14.533 --> 02:16.200

hoping for, like,

02:16.267 --> 02:17.867
"have your cake and eat it, too"
kind of advice.

02:17.933 --> 02:19.700

All right, nothing
is certain yet with Lachlan.

It is what is known
as appropriation.

05:13.467 --> 05:15.067
by giving her a few pieces
from our collection,

05:15.067 --> 05:17.667
but since then,
she has assisted other artists

05:17.733 --> 05:19.333

They self-publish

I want you to have time
