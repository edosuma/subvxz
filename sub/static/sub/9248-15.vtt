00:02.654 --> 00:04.308
I can't believe
I'm having dinner at your mom's

00:04.395 --> 00:06.267
on a Wednesday night;
our deal was Sundays only.

00:06.354 --> 00:07.529
Okay? You owe me.

00:07.616 --> 00:08.660
And no foot rubs.

00:08.747 --> 00:10.010
I want cold, hard cash.

00:10.097 --> 00:12.055
All right, come on, come on now.

00:12.142 --> 00:13.665
She just says she has
a surprise for me.

00:13.752 --> 00:14.884
Just roll with it.[doorbell rings]

00:14.971 --> 00:16.625
That last time
she said that,

00:16.712 --> 00:18.540
she had us come over and look
at a stain on her carpet

00:18.627 --> 00:20.498
that she thought
looked like Jesus.

00:20.585 --> 00:21.978
Yeah, that was ridiculous.

00:22.065 --> 00:24.024
At best, I was seeing
Kenny Loggins.

00:24.111 --> 00:27.114
About time.

00:27.201 --> 00:29.855
What'd you bring her for?
It's not Sunday.

00:30.987 --> 00:32.510
WOMAN:
Is that my boy?

00:32.597 --> 00:33.207
Kay?!

00:33.294 --> 00:35.209
Meatball!

00:35.296 --> 00:37.515
Get in here.

00:39.082 --> 00:41.650
[laughs]

00:41.737 --> 00:42.477
Oh, it's been years.

00:42.564 --> 00:44.087
How you been?

00:44.174 --> 00:45.306
Ah, you know me.
Give me a passport,

00:45.393 --> 00:46.959
a plane ticket
and clean panties,

00:47.047 --> 00:49.136
I'm good to go.

00:49.223 --> 00:50.876
Oh, Kay, you're awful.

00:50.963 --> 00:54.184
The nuns at school used
to beat her blue for that mouth.

00:54.271 --> 00:55.098
Ah, yeah, well,
they broke a lot of rulers,

00:55.185 --> 00:57.753
but they never broke me.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.581
And-and who is this?

00:59.668 --> 01:02.758
Meatball's got himself
a little girlfriend?

01:02.845 --> 01:03.933
This is Molly.

01:04.020 --> 01:06.109
My wife.

01:06.196 --> 01:07.545
Mom never told you?

01:07.632 --> 01:09.373
Well, I didn't want
to bother her

01:09.460 --> 01:11.941
if it turned out to be nothing.

01:12.028 --> 01:15.075
I-I don't go around
bragging about you, either.

01:15.162 --> 01:17.860
Boy, you must've
been pretty strong

01:17.947 --> 01:20.080
to pry him
out of her cold, dead hands.

01:20.167 --> 01:23.257
Bring it in, Mrs. Meatball.

01:23.344 --> 01:24.345
Oh, okay.

01:24.432 --> 01:26.042
Oh, we got a hugger!

01:26.129 --> 01:29.350
So, Kay, how long you
in town for this time?

01:29.437 --> 01:30.829
Ah, just the week.
My mom passed,

01:30.916 --> 01:32.831
so I have to make
all the arrangements.

01:32.918 --> 01:34.311
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:34.398 --> 01:35.573
Ah, don't be;
she and I had kind of

01:35.660 --> 01:37.184
a rocky relationship.

01:37.271 --> 01:40.100
"Rocky"? She attacked you
with a meat cleaver.

01:40.187 --> 01:42.841
Thank God she passed out drunk
on her backswing.

01:42.928 --> 01:44.800
[laughs]

01:44.887 --> 01:48.020
The, uh, mother-daughter stuff
can be kind of complicated.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.544
Yeah, that's the truth.

01:49.631 --> 01:52.024
Anyway, I'm just here
to make sure she's dead.

01:52.112 --> 01:57.204
And to, uh,
see my godson here

01:57.291 --> 01:59.684
and meet his lovely bride.Aw.

01:59.771 --> 02:03.645
Wow. You two are just so cute,
I could just eat you up.

02:03.732 --> 02:04.776
[laughs]

02:04.863 --> 02:06.169
[growls]

02:06.256 --> 02:07.301
[laughs]

02:07.388 --> 02:08.650
Give me some of that sugar!

02:08.737 --> 02:10.565
[all laughing]

02:10.652 --> 02:12.393
Hey, get over here, Peg!

02:12.480 --> 02:14.525
I'm good.

02:14.612 --> 02:15.700
Yeah, that's right. I forgot.

02:15.787 --> 02:17.572
You weren't much of a hugger.

02:17.659 --> 02:20.227
Unless it involved a boy
and the backseat of a car.

02:20.314 --> 02:22.794
Kay, they don't need
to hear all that.

02:22.881 --> 02:24.666
Yeah, we really don't.

02:24.753 --> 02:27.712
Hey, what ever happened
to that kid with the short arm

02:27.799 --> 02:30.367
who'd give you 50 cents
to punch him in the onions?

02:30.454 --> 02:31.499
Rusty?

02:31.586 --> 02:33.283
He's a city alderman.

02:33.370 --> 02:35.807
Still got a short arm,
still comes sniffing around.

02:35.894 --> 02:37.331
[laughs]
You slut!

02:37.418 --> 02:39.376
Call me what you will.

02:39.463 --> 02:41.465
At least there's no
potholes on my street.

02:44.207 --> 02:47.863
She just called your mom a slut.

02:47.950 --> 02:49.952
I love her.

03:19.068 --> 03:20.287
This doesn't seem safe.

03:20.374 --> 03:21.418
Two.Two.

03:21.505 --> 03:23.028
Ah, don't worry about it.

03:23.115 --> 03:23.986
They've been doing it
since he was little.

03:24.073 --> 03:25.117
Three!Three!

03:25.205 --> 03:26.858
[grunts]

03:26.945 --> 03:30.122
Oh, you've gotten a lot better
since you were 12!

03:30.210 --> 03:31.428
[laughs]
You beat a boy.

03:31.515 --> 03:33.169
Let's see if you can beat a man.

03:33.256 --> 03:36.868
Yeah, well, when one shows up,
I'll take him on.

03:36.955 --> 03:39.523
Whoa!

03:39.610 --> 03:41.873
Yeah! Yeah!

03:41.960 --> 03:43.353
MIKE:
Damn it!

03:43.440 --> 03:44.833
Best out of three!

03:44.920 --> 03:45.964
Oh, walk it off, Meatball.

03:46.051 --> 03:46.574
She's too good.

03:49.054 --> 03:51.187
Kay was our high school
leg wrestling champ.

03:51.274 --> 03:54.059
She even beat Sister Carmelina.

03:54.146 --> 03:55.626
I had to.

03:55.713 --> 03:57.454
The old penguin wouldn't give me
a recommendation

03:57.541 --> 03:58.673
to Berkeley until I pinned her.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.241
[laughs]

04:01.328 --> 04:02.372
You went to Berkeley?

04:02.459 --> 04:03.547
Class of '71.

04:03.634 --> 04:05.593
Wow. It was eye of the storm.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.508
Protests and sit-ins.

04:07.595 --> 04:09.901
That's... that must've
been so exciting.

04:09.988 --> 04:13.209
That's what I hear.
I don't remember much of it.

04:13.296 --> 04:15.255
The only thing
I took more than acid

04:15.342 --> 04:17.735
was a police baton to the head.

04:17.822 --> 04:19.868
Oh, you know, uh, in...
when I was in college,

04:19.955 --> 04:21.478
I took an Ultimate Frisbee
to the head.

04:21.565 --> 04:23.654
There's, like, a good,
you know, 45 minutes

04:23.741 --> 04:26.527
that just are completely blank.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.093
You get it.

04:28.180 --> 04:29.486
That's exactly why
I took up photography.

04:29.573 --> 04:31.314
I mean, it just
sort of helps you

04:31.401 --> 04:33.664
piece together
what you did the day before.

04:33.751 --> 04:35.623
[laughs]

04:35.710 --> 04:37.494
Kay started working
for National Geographic

04:37.581 --> 04:38.843
right after
the Peace Corps.

04:38.930 --> 04:40.541
National Geographic?Oh, my...

04:40.628 --> 04:43.021
I-I have been collecting that
since I was 13.

04:43.108 --> 04:46.721
I mean, that-that's why we can't
even park in the garage.

04:46.808 --> 04:48.592
She'd send me letters
from all over the world.

04:48.679 --> 04:52.161
The first naked lady
I ever saw was a picture

04:52.248 --> 04:54.685
Kay took of a tribe
in the rain forest.

04:54.772 --> 04:57.601
Who knew an old Kayapo woman
washing her clothes

04:57.688 --> 04:59.734
in the river would usher you
into manhood?

04:59.821 --> 05:02.389
[laughs]

05:02.476 --> 05:05.957
Hey, is that why you made me
hand wash your sweaters?

05:06.044 --> 05:07.742
Maybe.

05:08.917 --> 05:12.877
Kay has seen every inch
of this filthy planet.

05:12.964 --> 05:16.011
Yeah, there's only one place
I wouldn't dare go back to.

05:16.098 --> 05:16.751
Somalia?

05:16.838 --> 05:18.274
Florida.

05:20.407 --> 05:21.538
Awful place.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.453
Mickey Mouse, meth and mullets.

05:23.540 --> 05:26.587
Let the Cubans have it.

05:26.674 --> 05:29.154
So, what's on the
docket for tomorrow?

05:29.241 --> 05:31.243
Well, in the morning,
I got to be there when they run

05:31.331 --> 05:32.636
Mom's carcass
through the incinerator.

05:32.723 --> 05:34.464
Then, to keep

05:34.551 --> 05:37.946
the party going, I thought
I'd hit the Art Institute.

05:38.033 --> 05:39.861
Glad I'm working. Art museums.

05:39.948 --> 05:42.864
Just a way for perverts to look
at nude babies with wings.

05:45.519 --> 05:47.042
Oh, Peg, the world changes.

05:47.129 --> 05:48.565
You never do.

05:49.958 --> 05:51.438
You know, I'm free tomorrow

05:51.525 --> 05:53.440
if you're looking
for somebody to tag along.

05:53.527 --> 05:55.964
I thought you had to stay home
and pretend to write your book.

05:57.966 --> 05:58.923
You're a writer?

05:59.010 --> 06:00.838
[scoffs]

06:00.925 --> 06:03.406
Yeah, aspiring author, yes.

06:03.493 --> 06:04.886
Well, why don't you
come with me.

06:04.973 --> 06:06.017
We'll look at paintings
and I'll give you

06:06.104 --> 06:08.280
some stories to write about.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.718
Seriously? I would...
I would love that.

06:10.805 --> 06:12.633
Well, let's iron out the details
in the morning.

06:12.720 --> 06:13.808
And, uh, wear
some comfortable shoes.

06:13.895 --> 06:15.940
I like to cover a lot of ground.

06:16.027 --> 06:17.507
So do I.

06:17.594 --> 06:19.814
Oh, it's like...
it's like we're the same person.

06:19.901 --> 06:23.600
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have urgent business

06:23.687 --> 06:25.167
to the south.

06:25.254 --> 06:28.257
I got to meet a man
at Marwar Junction.

06:28.344 --> 06:29.519
I love Kay.

06:29.606 --> 06:31.129
She's got
the greatest expressions

06:31.216 --> 06:32.696
for going to the can.

06:32.783 --> 06:35.743
Is that what
that meant?

06:35.830 --> 06:37.658
Oh, God, she even makes
going to the bathroom

06:37.745 --> 06:40.312
sound like an adventure.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.966
See? Aren't you glad you came

06:42.053 --> 06:44.360
and met Kay instead of
faking that migraine?

06:44.447 --> 06:46.797
I really am.

06:46.884 --> 06:48.799
Just so you know,
Kay doesn't really want you

06:48.886 --> 06:50.105
to tag along with her
to the museum.

06:50.192 --> 06:52.107
Well, she invited me.Yeah.

06:52.194 --> 06:53.630
Don't you understand

06:53.717 --> 06:55.371
when someone's
just trying to be polite?

06:55.458 --> 06:57.199
Not in this house.

06:57.286 --> 07:00.071
She's here a week.

07:00.158 --> 07:01.290
Yeah, and you're working.

07:01.377 --> 07:02.987
She's myfriend.

07:03.074 --> 07:04.598
Go find your own.

07:06.251 --> 07:08.036
You know,
I really think I am

07:08.123 --> 07:09.907
starting to get a headache.

07:09.994 --> 07:11.779
Where do those migraines start?

07:11.866 --> 07:13.824
Right there.

07:17.045 --> 07:20.091
This Kay sounds great.
I'd love to meet her.

07:20.178 --> 07:22.224
I'd love to be her.Oh.

07:22.311 --> 07:24.095
What makes her so special?

07:24.182 --> 07:25.619
She's just full of life,

07:25.706 --> 07:28.012
and she's traveled
all over the world.

07:28.099 --> 07:30.493
So did I.
I was a flight attendant.

07:30.580 --> 07:33.757
You didn't explore the jungle,
you explored airport bars.

07:33.844 --> 07:35.150
Hey.

07:35.237 --> 07:37.500
Those bars can be
just as dangerous.

07:37.587 --> 07:41.199
There's creepy predators,
exotic diseases.

07:41.286 --> 07:44.246
And either place
you're gonna get bushwhacked.

07:44.333 --> 07:46.814
I-I'm just saying,
you get to meet a woman

07:46.901 --> 07:49.556
like Kay once in a lifetime,

07:49.643 --> 07:51.296
and I'm not gonna pass up
an opportunity

07:51.383 --> 07:52.776
to spend the day with her.

07:52.863 --> 07:54.865
So you're still
going to the museum?

07:54.952 --> 07:56.040
Yeah, why wouldn't I?

07:56.127 --> 07:57.389
Because it's pretty obvious

07:57.477 --> 07:59.174
my mother doesn't
want you to go.

07:59.261 --> 08:01.045
Oh, you're being silly.I'm being smart.

08:01.132 --> 08:03.395
The last thing you want to do
is get on her bad side.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.919
Is there a good side?

08:05.006 --> 08:08.096
Yes, and believe it
or not, you're on it.

08:08.183 --> 08:11.012
Your tires aren't slashed,
no dog turds in the mailbox,

08:11.099 --> 08:12.927
and the women at her church
don't think you have syphilis.

08:13.014 --> 08:15.059
Oh, God!

08:15.146 --> 08:16.800
Why do you think
that amazing house

08:16.887 --> 08:19.194
across the street from
her gets sold every year?

08:19.281 --> 08:20.630
I thought it was black mold.

08:20.717 --> 08:22.545
She's the black mold.

08:24.155 --> 08:26.680
Please, just leave Kay alone.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.638
But we...Ah-da-da-da-da! Ah!

08:28.725 --> 08:31.815
Make good choices.

08:34.688 --> 08:36.428
This is stupid.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.039
A grown woman telling me
who I can't be friends with.

08:38.126 --> 08:40.868
Maybe Peggy and Kay
are more than friends.

08:40.955 --> 08:43.087
What?

08:43.174 --> 08:45.133
You said they went to
an all-girls school.

08:45.220 --> 08:48.049
Dorm full of
pubescent teens,

08:48.136 --> 08:50.573
brimming with sexual curiosity.

08:50.660 --> 08:51.835
Lights go out.

08:51.922 --> 08:54.838
A gentle hand reaches over.

08:56.492 --> 08:58.973
Caressing your red hair.

09:01.018 --> 09:03.891
Telling you you're pretty
when no one else will.

09:03.978 --> 09:06.110
Mom?

09:06.197 --> 09:07.982
I'm just trying to help
Molly make sense

09:08.069 --> 09:11.115
of a confusing time
in a girl's life.

09:11.202 --> 09:13.422
No, this is confusing!

09:14.815 --> 09:16.599
God, I'm calling Kay.

09:16.686 --> 09:17.905
That's the spirit.

09:17.992 --> 09:19.384
Fight for your woman.No...

09:19.471 --> 09:20.603
It's not like that.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.649
I just... I want
to go see some art

09:22.736 --> 09:25.434
with one of the most interesting
women I have ever met.

09:25.521 --> 09:27.088
Mike might be afraid
of his mother, but I am not.

09:27.175 --> 09:30.047
[phone ringing]

09:30.134 --> 09:32.223
Hello?

09:32.310 --> 09:34.269
[deep voice]:
Wrong number.

09:39.143 --> 09:41.276
You know I love my wife.Mm-hmm.

09:41.363 --> 09:43.147
But the more you tell her
not to do something,

09:43.234 --> 09:44.845
the more she's
gonna do it.

09:44.932 --> 09:47.456
Uh, Molly has to know
three women can't get along.

09:47.543 --> 09:48.849
I mean, with guys, it works.

09:48.936 --> 09:50.677
Three Musketeers,
Three Stooges, us.

09:50.764 --> 09:52.896
It's magical.

09:52.983 --> 09:54.506
You know why it
works with guys?

09:54.594 --> 09:55.856
Because Curly doesn't care

09:55.943 --> 09:58.554
if Moe takes Larry
to the museum.

09:58.641 --> 10:01.775
It's a friendship,
not a competition.

10:01.862 --> 10:02.863
In a perfect world.

10:02.950 --> 10:04.212
What are
you talking about?

10:04.299 --> 10:06.040
Carl, please. You'd
be horribly jealous

10:06.127 --> 10:08.042
if Mike and I did
something without you.

10:08.129 --> 10:10.218
[laughs]
No, I wouldn't.

10:10.305 --> 10:12.916
[laughs]

10:13.003 --> 10:16.180
Have you done something
without me?

10:17.921 --> 10:21.882
Mike, we can't keep living
this lie.

10:23.579 --> 10:26.234
We went bowling.
No big deal.

10:26.321 --> 10:29.063
One time. It-it just happened.

10:29.150 --> 10:31.065
[sniffs]
I see.

10:31.152 --> 10:33.850
You can't be mad.No, I'm not.

10:33.937 --> 10:36.200
The two of you went out, you had
some fun. I'm happy for you.

10:36.287 --> 10:37.071
Really?

10:37.158 --> 10:38.768
Of course.

10:38.855 --> 10:40.857
[exhales] That's a
relief, because...

10:40.944 --> 10:42.119
Don't you touch me.

10:46.036 --> 10:47.995
[laughs]:
You did not.

10:48.082 --> 10:49.474
Well, I broke
a couple of commandments,

10:49.561 --> 10:51.128
but, I mean, you got to do
what you got to do

10:51.215 --> 10:52.608
to get out of a Turkish prison.

10:52.695 --> 10:55.524
Oh, my God. I once
showed my cleavage

10:55.611 --> 10:57.395
to get away from
mall security,

10:57.482 --> 10:59.049
so I think we've both done
things we're not so proud of.

10:59.136 --> 11:01.008
[both laugh]

11:01.095 --> 11:03.532
You know, I'm so glad
you called this morning,

11:03.619 --> 11:05.142
but when I-I answered the phone,

11:05.229 --> 11:07.144
it sounded like you had
an English accent.

11:07.231 --> 11:09.016
[English accent]:
Did I? [laughs]

11:09.103 --> 11:11.018
This is one of the best
collections I've seen.

11:11.105 --> 11:12.976
Yeah.

11:13.063 --> 11:15.849
I mean, the best
that's been legally obtained.

11:15.936 --> 11:17.328
What does that mean?

11:17.415 --> 11:20.288
Fidel Castro had
amazing taste in stolen art.

11:20.375 --> 11:21.681
What?

11:21.768 --> 11:23.117
But for a Latin,
he was a lousy lover.

11:23.204 --> 11:25.685
Oh, my God, there
are so many things

11:25.772 --> 11:28.122
about that sentence
that you need to explain to me.

11:28.209 --> 11:31.255
Well, pace yourself. I
got a lot more stories,

11:31.342 --> 11:33.605
we got a lot
more art to see.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.130
Before we do that, I need to
sit down with Georgia O'Keeffe

11:36.217 --> 11:38.001
and have a wee chat.

11:38.088 --> 11:41.048
I'm sorry, but I love it when
you have to go to the bathroom.

11:41.135 --> 11:42.876
[both laugh]Oh, you know what,

11:42.963 --> 11:45.052
let's go up to the third
floor; there's one up there.

11:45.139 --> 11:47.532
And then we can catch
the Americana exhibit.

11:47.619 --> 11:48.838
[chuckles]

11:48.925 --> 11:50.535
[elevator bell dings]

11:50.622 --> 11:53.103
Oh...

11:53.190 --> 11:55.410
Miss me?

11:55.497 --> 11:57.891
[English accent]:
Bloody hell.

12:05.028 --> 12:07.683
All right, ladies,
here's your coffee. Fuel up.

12:07.770 --> 12:10.120
We still have all of the
expressionists to explore.

12:10.207 --> 12:11.818
I just wish that The Screamwas
here. That's really my favorite.

12:11.905 --> 12:14.081
Oh. You want
to hear something cool?

12:14.168 --> 12:15.604
Hmm?

12:15.691 --> 12:16.213
The reddish sky
that Munch painted...

12:16.300 --> 12:17.911
Yeah.

12:17.998 --> 12:20.348
...was inspired
by the eruption of Krakatoa.

12:20.435 --> 12:21.741
No, I did not know that.

12:21.828 --> 12:24.526
I swear, being with you

12:24.613 --> 12:28.399
is like taking a master
class in awesome.

12:28.486 --> 12:31.620
Kay, remember that volcano
we made in eighth grade?

12:33.361 --> 12:35.145
You know, um,

12:35.232 --> 12:37.060
several summers ago,
I was in Naples

12:37.147 --> 12:39.671
when Vesuvius was
just spewing lava,

12:39.759 --> 12:41.151
and we had just
come from Pompeii.

12:41.238 --> 12:43.414
Ah, don't
you adore Naples?
Oh.

12:43.501 --> 12:46.069
I mean, it's full
of dwarves and hunchbacks

12:46.156 --> 12:47.070
and the best pizza
in the world.

12:47.157 --> 12:49.507
Oh... Pizzeria Brandi.

12:49.594 --> 12:51.074
[gasps]
Molto bene.

12:51.161 --> 12:53.598
Oh, que bella.
[chuckles]

12:53.685 --> 12:54.686
If you two are gonna keep
speaking SpaghettiOs,

12:54.774 --> 12:56.776
I'm leaving.

12:56.863 --> 12:59.909
[chuckles]
Peg, take it easy.

12:59.996 --> 13:01.258
Don't you see what she's doing?

13:01.345 --> 13:03.043
She's trying
to take you from me.

13:03.130 --> 13:06.655
This is Dolores Wisnicki
all over again.

13:06.742 --> 13:08.048
Are you still stuck on that?

13:08.135 --> 13:09.745
That's 50 years ago.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.747
You don't forget a betrayal
like that.

13:11.834 --> 13:15.185
She came rolling into town
in her new Cutlass Supreme,

13:15.272 --> 13:18.493
and you left me behind
like a fart at a party.

13:19.581 --> 13:21.931
You're being
ridiculous.

13:22.018 --> 13:25.195
You know what's ridiculous
is $3.50 for a cup of coffee.

13:25.282 --> 13:28.068
What?

13:28.155 --> 13:30.766
Did you ever think
maybe it wasn't Dolores's car

13:30.853 --> 13:33.334
that drove me away?

13:33.421 --> 13:34.901
What's that
supposed to mean?

13:34.988 --> 13:36.076
[chuckles]
You know,

13:36.163 --> 13:39.340
I almost drowned
in the Amazon.

13:39.427 --> 13:41.777
I've even had worms
living in my eyeballs.

13:41.864 --> 13:46.695
But the worst pain in my ass
has been being friends with you.

13:46.782 --> 13:48.392
You're no walk
in the park.

13:48.479 --> 13:50.830
I get you one week
every three years.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.875
You're like a yeast infection!

13:55.008 --> 13:58.663
Well, my dear,
consider yourself cured.

14:02.667 --> 14:06.367
You want to tell me about the
volcano in eighth grade? Okay.

14:10.893 --> 14:13.069
[door opens]

14:13.156 --> 14:15.985
What did you do?!

14:16.072 --> 14:18.248
I didn't make good choices.

14:18.335 --> 14:20.250
No, you didn't!

14:20.337 --> 14:22.426
I'm so sorry.Honey, in one day,
you managed to destroy

14:22.513 --> 14:24.037
five decades of friendship

14:24.124 --> 14:26.517
because you couldn't leave
well enough alone.

14:26.604 --> 14:28.171
It was just a little trip
to the museum.

14:28.258 --> 14:30.086
She's blowing this
out of proportion.

14:30.173 --> 14:32.828
It's my mother. Blowing stuff up
is what she does!

14:32.915 --> 14:35.222
I can talk to her.You can't.

14:35.309 --> 14:37.093
You've been banished
from the house. But I haven't.

14:37.180 --> 14:40.009
I still get to go
all by myself. Yay!

14:40.096 --> 14:42.011
You know,
you were my buffer.

14:42.098 --> 14:45.928
Wasn't the reason I married you,
but it was a big plus!

14:46.015 --> 14:48.061
Listen, your mom just needs
to cool off.

14:48.148 --> 14:49.540
She doesn't cool off.

14:49.627 --> 14:51.891
She keeps burning
like an underground fire!

14:51.978 --> 14:54.110
All right, Mike,
I will make this right.

14:54.197 --> 14:55.242
Impossible!

14:55.329 --> 14:56.547
You're done. I'm all alone.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.419
No partner, no backup.

14:58.506 --> 15:00.290
You handed me to her
on a platter.

15:00.377 --> 15:01.901
[groans]

15:10.387 --> 15:12.041
Peggy, it's Molly.

15:12.128 --> 15:14.130
It's been two days.

15:14.217 --> 15:16.959
You have to talk to me
at some point.

15:17.046 --> 15:19.657
[doorbell rings]

15:21.703 --> 15:23.052
Peggy, please.

15:23.139 --> 15:25.663
Okay, I know I shouldn't have

15:25.750 --> 15:27.404
gotten in between
you and your friend,

15:27.491 --> 15:29.232
and I'm sorry.

15:29.319 --> 15:31.452
You can be mad at me
all you want,

15:31.539 --> 15:33.454
but I'm not giving up on you.

15:33.541 --> 15:36.500
'Cause I don't give up
on family.

15:39.068 --> 15:40.983
Oh, come on!

15:41.070 --> 15:43.986
I worked on that speech all day!

15:53.909 --> 15:56.042
[window opens]

15:56.129 --> 15:57.565
[barking]
Shh!

15:57.652 --> 15:58.696
[quietly]:
Shh. Be quiet.

15:58.783 --> 16:00.872
Ooh...
[grunts]

16:00.960 --> 16:02.526
Jim, what are you barking at?

16:03.745 --> 16:05.268
[screams]

16:05.355 --> 16:06.356
It's me! It's just...

16:06.443 --> 16:08.880
It's just me.
Oh, God.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.667
I thought you were Kay's dead
mother coming back to haunt me.

16:12.754 --> 16:14.277
I'm sorry.

16:14.364 --> 16:16.062
What are you doing here?
Get out of my house.

16:16.149 --> 16:17.933
No, not until we talk.

16:18.020 --> 16:20.631
You heard all I want to say
to you. Now out!

16:20.718 --> 16:23.286
You're running out of people
to ban from your house, Peggy.

16:23.373 --> 16:24.287
I don't care.

16:24.374 --> 16:25.897
I don't believe that.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.508
I mean, I-I believe
that you never want me

16:27.595 --> 16:29.510
to be in your house again,
but...

16:29.597 --> 16:31.338
Okay, well, but about Kay?

16:31.425 --> 16:33.122
I mean, you're-you're just
gonna throw away

16:33.209 --> 16:34.428
50 years of friendship?

16:34.515 --> 16:36.212
Watch me.

16:36.299 --> 16:38.127
If I can do it to a sister,
I can do it to her.

16:38.214 --> 16:39.476
Mike has an aunt?

16:39.563 --> 16:40.173
Not anymore.

16:42.827 --> 16:44.960
Are you through?No. And neither is Kay.

16:45.047 --> 16:47.528
You know, your best friend
is at a funeral home

16:47.615 --> 16:49.269
saying good-bye
to her mother right now.

16:49.356 --> 16:50.792
And she wants you there.

16:50.879 --> 16:51.923
No, she doesn't.Yes, she does.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.925
How do you know?

16:54.970 --> 16:58.017
'Cause she... told me.

16:58.104 --> 17:00.976
What were her
exact words?

17:01.063 --> 17:03.979
"I want Peggy...

17:04.066 --> 17:06.503
there."

17:07.591 --> 17:09.202
That does sound like her.

17:11.030 --> 17:14.294
[organ playing dirge]

17:27.785 --> 17:29.048
What'd I tell you?

17:29.135 --> 17:31.006
Nobody.

17:36.229 --> 17:38.927
What are you doing here?

17:39.014 --> 17:40.059
She said you wanted me
to come.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.539
I never said that.

17:42.626 --> 17:45.455
Okay, it doesn't
matter who said what

17:45.542 --> 17:47.066
or whether any
of it was true.

17:47.153 --> 17:48.197
The important thing
is is that you're...

17:48.284 --> 17:50.069
you're both
here together.

17:50.156 --> 17:53.289
Take me home.
No.

17:53.376 --> 17:55.552
Nobody should have to say
good-bye to their mother alone.

17:55.639 --> 17:56.249
Go.

18:04.344 --> 18:08.217
I thought she'd outlive
us both just for spite.

18:10.263 --> 18:12.482
It's odd.

18:12.569 --> 18:16.138
All that hatefulness
packed into one little urn.

18:27.497 --> 18:29.020
I'm glad you came.

18:29.108 --> 18:32.111
Wouldn't be
anywhere else.

18:33.112 --> 18:36.202
[sniffles]

18:52.087 --> 18:53.697
Thanks for giving Molly
another chance, Ma.

18:53.784 --> 18:55.656
Well, sometimes you got to learn
to forgive.

18:55.743 --> 18:58.049
Otherwise, you end up
with nobody at your funeral

18:58.137 --> 19:00.617
and your ashes in a Dumpster
behind the Walgreens.

19:02.576 --> 19:05.666
Okay, you gonna wrestle
or just lay there?

19:05.753 --> 19:07.885
KAY/MOLLY: One!Remember, Molly,
it's all about balance.

19:07.972 --> 19:09.800
KAY/MOLLY:
Two!

19:09.887 --> 19:12.238
Come on, Kay, do her
like you done Mikey!

19:12.325 --> 19:13.239
KAY/MOLLY:
Three!

19:13.326 --> 19:14.849
[grunts]

19:14.936 --> 19:17.721
Good God, she's strong!

19:17.808 --> 19:21.072
I... am... Mrs. Meatball!
