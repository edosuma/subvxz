00:59.125 --> 01:03.118
"What are you doing up here? "
he asked himself.

01:03.125 --> 01:06.162
Don't you remember?
You hate heights.

01:06.166 --> 01:09.158
Or is it that heights hate you?

01:09.166 --> 01:11.157
I could never figure out
which was which,

01:11.166 --> 01:13.657
but either way,

01:13.667 --> 01:16.659
I was determined that today
I was going to overcome it all.

01:16.667 --> 01:20.159
I had a siyable rock face
called The Widowmaker to climb,

01:20.166 --> 01:21.656
and an expert to show me

01:21.667 --> 01:24.158
how to do it.

01:24.166 --> 01:25.702
Wishful thinking.

01:28.166 --> 01:30.703
There's an old climber's
saying.

01:30.709 --> 01:33.155
"It's not the fall
that kills you.

01:33.166 --> 01:35.703
It's the sudden stop."

01:38.709 --> 01:39.698
Mike?

01:39.709 --> 01:41.165
Yes, MacGyver,
what is it?

01:41.166 --> 01:44.704
What do you suggest I do now?

01:44.709 --> 01:45.698
Is there a problem?

01:45.709 --> 01:46.698
Oh, no.

01:46.709 --> 01:48.700
Just hanging around down here.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.700
Not a foothold in sight.

01:50.709 --> 01:53.701
That's because you've narrowed
your sights to the ground below.

01:53.709 --> 01:55.199
Think up.

01:55.208 --> 01:57.199
Now check yourself,
waist high,

01:57.208 --> 01:59.699
over to your left
about three feet.

01:59.709 --> 02:01.199
There's a good hold.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.698
See it?

02:02.709 --> 02:05.200
Yeah, I see it.

02:05.208 --> 02:08.746
How the heck?
Don't look down.

02:08.750 --> 02:10.741
Just pull yourself up.

02:14.750 --> 02:16.741
You're really enjoying this,
aren't you?

02:16.750 --> 02:18.206
Having the time of my life.

02:18.208 --> 02:19.197
But hurry up.

02:19.208 --> 02:21.199
My arms are
getting tired.

02:41.250 --> 02:44.242
Your hands
are probably sweaty.

02:44.250 --> 02:46.241
Use your chalk bag.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.282
That's it. Good.

03:12.291 --> 03:14.282
Keep going.

03:14.291 --> 03:15.781
Good!

03:19.792 --> 03:22.283
Very nice, MacGyver.

03:22.291 --> 03:24.282
Executed with pure finesse.

03:24.291 --> 03:27.283
Not to mention panic.

03:27.291 --> 03:28.827
Come on over here.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.290
We'll do lunch.

03:34.291 --> 03:35.827
I hate this stuff.

03:35.834 --> 03:39.281
Chalk isn't one of my favorite
condiments.

03:40.834 --> 03:44.326
Have a bout
of vertigo down there?

03:44.333 --> 03:45.823
Yeah.

03:45.834 --> 03:49.326
You know, it's weird,
not knowing up from down.

03:49.333 --> 03:53.827
Well, you straightened
yourself out just fine.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.825
Thanks for hanging on
to me.

03:55.834 --> 03:57.324
Oh, come on, MacGyver.

03:57.333 --> 04:00.825
I've spent half my life
hanging on to you.

04:02.333 --> 04:03.869
Uh-oh, she's
getting suggestive

04:03.875 --> 04:05.866
and he's getting
uncomfortable...

04:05.875 --> 04:09.868
Come on, Mike.
We've been friends a long time.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.331
Maybe too long.

04:12.875 --> 04:15.867
I didn't mean it
like that, I mean...

04:15.875 --> 04:18.332
I just want more.

04:18.333 --> 04:20.870
And not from someone else.

04:20.875 --> 04:22.866
From you.

04:25.375 --> 04:28.367
But then you're hopeless
and I'm hapless.

04:28.375 --> 04:30.866
No, you're not.

04:30.875 --> 04:32.866
You're my best friend.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.365
Mike, we've always
been there for each other.

04:36.375 --> 04:37.865
Isn't that
the most important thing?

04:37.875 --> 04:39.365
All those women in your life

04:39.375 --> 04:41.866
and you never learned a thing,
did you?

04:44.375 --> 04:47.367
Look uh... just forget about it.

04:47.375 --> 04:50.367
No sense ruining a beautiful
friendship, right?

04:50.375 --> 04:50.909
Mike...

04:50.917 --> 04:51.906
We'd better get jamming.

04:51.917 --> 04:54.374
We've got to make Widow's Ledge
and Broomstick Crack

04:54.375 --> 04:55.911
before we lose our light.

04:55.917 --> 04:57.373
Clip in...

04:57.375 --> 04:58.364
I'm on belay.

04:58.375 --> 04:59.364
Wait a minute.

05:01.917 --> 05:03.373
Belay on.

05:03.375 --> 05:04.410
Climbing.

05:05.917 --> 05:07.908
Climb on.

05:38.417 --> 05:39.953
Mike?

06:06.001 --> 06:06.990
Mike, you okay?

06:12.001 --> 06:14.993
Mike... you all right?

06:15.001 --> 06:16.457
Oh... oh...

06:18.001 --> 06:18.990
Falling!

06:29.001 --> 06:29.990
Mike!

06:39.001 --> 06:39.990
Mike!

06:40.001 --> 06:40.990
Mac...

06:43.001 --> 06:44.491
Mike!

06:48.000 --> 06:49.991
Mike!

07:08.542 --> 07:09.998
Did MacGyver call?

07:10.000 --> 07:11.536
No. Wasn't he at the funeral?

07:11.542 --> 07:12.998
No.

07:13.000 --> 07:13.989
And he's not at his houseboat
either.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.991
For all we know, he's probably
still holed up in my cabin.

07:16.542 --> 07:20.990
Eh... well, I guess I've got
to give him a few more days.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.537
This is serious, huh?

07:23.542 --> 07:25.032
Yeah, it's serious.

07:25.041 --> 07:26.531
MacGyver is running.

07:26.542 --> 07:28.533
The funny thing
about running is,

07:28.542 --> 07:30.032
you always end up
taking yourself with you.

07:30.041 --> 07:32.032
Listen, it took
a chopper rescue team

07:32.041 --> 07:33.030
to get him off that mountain.

07:33.041 --> 07:34.531
He must have been paralyyed
with fear.

07:34.542 --> 07:36.032
Maybe.

07:36.041 --> 07:40.034
And he's probably blaming
himself for what happened.

07:40.041 --> 07:42.532
And God knows what did happen.

07:42.542 --> 07:45.033
I can't explain it.

07:45.041 --> 07:47.032
Mike was an expert.

07:47.041 --> 07:49.032
You know, she climbed
The Widowmaker twice before?

07:49.041 --> 07:50.577
She and MacGyver went way back,

07:50.583 --> 07:52.039
didn't they?

07:52.041 --> 08:00.039
Well... they were, uh...
the best of friends.

08:10.083 --> 08:12.074
MacGyver?

08:15.083 --> 08:17.574
Kind of thought
I'd find you here.

08:19.583 --> 08:22.074
You want to talk?

08:22.083 --> 08:24.620
No, Pete, I don't.

08:26.625 --> 08:31.073
All right, I'll talk.

08:33.625 --> 08:36.616
You may not want to hear
this right now, but...

08:36.625 --> 08:39.616
I'm going
to tell you anyway.

08:39.625 --> 08:42.616
I went to the service for Mike.

08:42.625 --> 08:44.616
And it was very special.

08:44.625 --> 08:48.117
There was a good feeling there.

08:48.125 --> 08:49.615
A lot of love.

08:51.625 --> 08:53.616
I want you to know that...

08:53.625 --> 08:57.618
everyone understood
why you weren't there.

08:59.625 --> 09:01.115
Thanks.

09:04.667 --> 09:06.123
Well...

09:06.125 --> 09:09.663
you've been up
here over a week.

09:09.667 --> 09:12.124
Don't you think
it's time you came home?

09:12.125 --> 09:14.662
To what?

09:14.667 --> 09:16.123
Oh, well, I don't know.

09:16.125 --> 09:21.665
Your life... friends...
work... the Foundation.

09:23.667 --> 09:26.158
I've got a couple of cases
that have your name on them.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.657
No, thanks.

09:28.667 --> 09:33.661
You know, that may be exactly
what you need right now.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.157
Forget it.

09:37.667 --> 09:39.658
Okay.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.703
So what are you
going to do?

09:45.166 --> 09:48.704
Sit around up here,
beating your brains out?

09:48.709 --> 09:50.700
Over something
you can do nothing about?

09:50.709 --> 09:52.700
Something that's
already happened?

09:55.166 --> 09:57.703
Punishing yourself is not going
to bring Mike back.

09:57.709 --> 10:00.155
Neither is working for you,
so get off my case.

10:08.709 --> 10:14.705
Look... I know nothing's going
to bring her back.

10:15.208 --> 10:16.698
It was my fault.

10:16.709 --> 10:18.700
Do you understand that?

10:18.709 --> 10:21.200
You want to know what I think?

10:21.208 --> 10:24.200
I think Mike fell.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.741
And there was nothing
you could do about it.

10:30.208 --> 10:35.202
Pete, I want you
to understand something.

10:35.208 --> 10:39.201
I want to be left alone.

10:39.208 --> 10:43.201
Away from everybody...
away from everything.

10:44.750 --> 10:45.739
Okay?

10:52.250 --> 10:53.740
Okay.

10:58.250 --> 11:00.241
You got it.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.783
Take care of yourself.

12:09.834 --> 12:12.325
Hello. MacGyver, you home?

12:12.333 --> 12:15.825
This is Nikki.

12:16.333 --> 12:19.325
You've been gone
for, uh, what, two weeks now?

12:19.333 --> 12:20.322
Gone?

12:20.333 --> 12:22.324
I hope you're doing okay.
Gone where?

12:22.333 --> 12:23.823
But I guess
if you're hearing this,

12:23.834 --> 12:26.871
you've gotten tired of playing
old man of the mountain.

12:26.875 --> 12:29.867
Pete and I left messages for you
at Ellard's store...

12:29.875 --> 12:31.331
but I suppose you don't

12:31.333 --> 12:33.870
get out much.

12:33.875 --> 12:35.331
Anyway...

12:35.333 --> 12:37.324
I know this is tough for you,

12:37.333 --> 12:38.869
and I want you to know I'm here
if you want to talk, okay?

12:38.875 --> 12:41.867
Call me.

12:41.875 --> 12:43.866
We miss you.

12:45.875 --> 12:48.867
But I only miss once.

12:48.875 --> 12:50.365
Mac, how you doing?

12:50.875 --> 12:51.864
It's your old buddy,
Jack Dalton.

12:51.875 --> 12:53.866
I missed you at the funeral.

12:53.875 --> 12:55.365
Everybody did.

12:55.375 --> 13:00.369
Listen, I want you to hang tough
and call me, will you, partner?

13:01.375 --> 13:03.866
MacGyver, it's Pete...

13:03.875 --> 13:06.912
Hi, Pete.
How's tricks?

13:06.917 --> 13:07.906
...all right, I know.

13:07.917 --> 13:09.373
You want to be left alone.

13:09.375 --> 13:10.911
But I'm starting to get worried.

13:10.917 --> 13:11.906
You know me:
I'm just that way...

13:12.375 --> 13:13.911
I'll see that he gets
the message.

13:13.917 --> 13:14.906
...if you don't mind,

13:14.917 --> 13:16.373
give your old pal a call
when you're ready, huh?

13:16.375 --> 13:17.364
I hope you're all right.

13:17.375 --> 13:18.911
Just take care of yourself.

13:18.917 --> 13:21.909
Oh, I'll take care of him
all right.

13:21.917 --> 13:25.409
And I'll be back
to take care of you.

14:39.001 --> 14:40.457
How was he?

14:40.458 --> 14:43.450
Not good at all.

14:43.458 --> 14:45.494
There was no life in him.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.991
Can you imagine MacGyver
with no smile?

14:48.001 --> 14:49.491
No light behind the eyes?

14:49.500 --> 14:52.492
In fact, he wouldn't
even talk to me really.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.991
Maybe somebody else should try.

14:55.001 --> 14:56.491
Nikki, I've known MacGyver
for eight years.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.491
I don't think
I know anyone close enough

14:58.500 --> 14:59.489
to get through to him right now.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.992
Pete, is it possible
that you'retooclose?

15:03.001 --> 15:03.990
What do you mean by that?

15:04.001 --> 15:05.491
Well, maybe
what he needs

15:05.500 --> 15:07.491
is someone that he
doesn't know so well...

15:07.500 --> 15:08.990
someone that
he can open up to.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.491
Someone like you, maybe?

15:11.500 --> 15:14.492
Nikki, you and MacGyver
have never agreed on anything.

15:14.500 --> 15:17.492
Yeah, that's true, but
I was just thinking...

15:17.500 --> 15:18.990
You're really worried
about him, aren't you?

15:19.000 --> 15:20.490
Well, like you said...

15:20.500 --> 15:22.991
no smile, no light
behind the eyes.

15:23.500 --> 15:24.535
Somebody's got to try.

15:24.542 --> 15:25.998
Hmm.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.993
Well, maybe I've been
going at it the wrong way.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.992
Maybe you're exactly
what hedoesneed.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.537
Stop at the general store
in Ridgemont.

15:35.542 --> 15:36.531
Talk to a man named Ellard.

15:36.542 --> 15:38.533
He'll give you
whatever you need,

15:38.542 --> 15:39.998
and point you
in the right direction.

15:41.542 --> 15:43.999
Hello. Ellard's Grocery.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.537
Hi there, Roy. Hang on a sec.

15:46.542 --> 15:48.032
As I was saying,
these rock climbers

15:48.041 --> 15:49.531
are a crayy bunch...
a breed apart.

15:50.041 --> 15:51.531
But Mike, she was one
of the sensible ones.

15:51.542 --> 15:53.533
Oh, not that climbing
the Widowmaker

15:53.542 --> 15:54.531
makes any sense
to me at all.

15:54.542 --> 15:57.033
But Mike, she didn't have
no death wish, you know?

15:57.041 --> 15:58.531
She knew what she was doing,

15:58.542 --> 16:00.533
or she wouldn't have
taken MacGyver up there

16:00.542 --> 16:02.032
in the first place.

16:02.041 --> 16:03.531
Has MacGyver
come down here?

16:03.542 --> 16:05.578
Nope. He's just been
keeping to himself.

16:05.583 --> 16:07.574
Oh, some of the locals
have seen him now and then...

16:07.583 --> 16:09.039
hiking, fishing, whatnot.

16:09.041 --> 16:11.578
I know what he's going through.

16:11.583 --> 16:15.576
I was on a destroyer went down
in the Battle of Midway.

16:15.583 --> 16:18.040
Lost some good buddies.

16:18.041 --> 16:20.578
Well, you put them to bed,
but you never forget them.

16:20.583 --> 16:22.039
Know what I mean?

16:22.041 --> 16:26.080
Yeah. Oh, listen, no need
to keep your friend waiting.

16:26.083 --> 16:28.074
Go on. I can
take it from here.

16:28.083 --> 16:29.072
You sure?

16:29.083 --> 16:30.573
I'm sure. Thanks, Ellard.

16:30.583 --> 16:32.574
And I'll be sure
to tell Pete you said hello.

16:54.083 --> 16:56.074
Terrific!

16:56.083 --> 16:57.619
You want to pop
your hood, lady?

17:06.125 --> 17:09.117
Let me see what the problem is.

17:09.125 --> 17:13.117
I know there's plenty of gas.

17:13.125 --> 17:15.116
You want to try her now, ma'am?

17:23.625 --> 17:27.664
Looks like you got some frayed
spark plug wires there, ma'am.

17:27.666 --> 17:29.658
You going to be
traveling far today?

17:29.667 --> 17:30.656
Well, not right away.

17:30.667 --> 17:32.658
I'm heading up to the end
of Widow Canyon.

17:32.667 --> 17:33.656
Visiting a friend.

17:34.125 --> 17:35.114
Widow Canyon?

17:35.125 --> 17:38.663
It's mighty beautiful
up there, ma'am.

17:38.667 --> 17:43.115
Your friend... he'd be, uh...
mechanically inclined?

17:43.125 --> 17:45.662
Oh, yes. Most definitely.

17:45.667 --> 17:49.159
Well, I'd have him strip
and clean those wires real good.

17:49.166 --> 17:51.157
I will. Thank you.

18:23.709 --> 18:25.700
Hello!

18:25.709 --> 18:27.700
MacGyver?

18:35.208 --> 18:37.199
Anybody home?

19:08.250 --> 19:09.740
Hi, stranger.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.248
I was going to ask you

19:30.250 --> 19:31.786
how you're
keeping yourself,

19:31.792 --> 19:33.783
but the answer's
pretty obvious.

19:33.792 --> 19:35.248
You look awful.

19:35.250 --> 19:37.241
You came all the way up here

19:37.250 --> 19:38.786
to give a critique?

19:38.792 --> 19:40.248
It's a start.

19:41.792 --> 19:43.248
How did you find me?

19:43.250 --> 19:44.786
Pete.

19:44.792 --> 19:46.282
I told him
to leave me alone.

19:46.291 --> 19:47.781
And he has.

19:47.792 --> 19:49.282
So what are
you doing here?

19:49.291 --> 19:50.781
Trying to help.

19:52.291 --> 19:55.283
Don't need any.

19:57.291 --> 19:58.781
So... that's it?

19:58.792 --> 20:01.784
Over and out, huh?

20:01.792 --> 20:04.829
Listen, MacGyver, time
to get back with the living.

20:04.834 --> 20:06.825
Nikki...

20:06.834 --> 20:08.290
go home.

20:08.291 --> 20:10.828
Oh, I will, soon as you
get your act together.

20:13.291 --> 20:14.827
Did you hear me?

20:14.834 --> 20:17.280
Yeah. Now, I'm going to be
running you a hot bath in there

20:17.291 --> 20:18.827
while I put the supplies away.

20:18.834 --> 20:20.825
Figured you'd be tired
of eating fish by now, huh?

20:20.834 --> 20:22.825
Look! I don't want you here!

20:22.834 --> 20:24.290
I don't need you!

20:24.291 --> 20:26.327
I can take care of myself.

20:26.333 --> 20:29.825
Boy, you sure know how to make
a girl feel welcome, don't you?

20:29.834 --> 20:30.823
You invited yourself.

20:30.834 --> 20:32.324
I came here because

20:32.333 --> 20:33.823
I care about you, you jerk.

20:33.834 --> 20:36.826
Now, MacGyver, we are
friends, aren't we?

20:36.834 --> 20:38.825
Spare yourself.

20:38.834 --> 20:40.825
Friends of mine
end up getting hurt.

20:40.834 --> 20:42.324
Oh, I'd sure like to see you

20:42.333 --> 20:43.823
scrub some of
that self-pity off

20:43.834 --> 20:45.870
along with the
rest of the dirt.

20:45.875 --> 20:48.867
To hear you talk, it's as if
you pushed Mike off the mountain.

20:48.875 --> 20:50.331
Hey! You know nothing about it.

20:50.333 --> 20:51.869
That's why I came here.

20:52.333 --> 20:53.869
Tell me about it.

20:55.875 --> 20:57.866
You're staying, I'm leaving.

20:57.875 --> 20:59.331
That's right. Go ahead.

20:59.333 --> 21:00.869
Let it make
a basket case out of you.

21:00.875 --> 21:03.332
That way, you don't have
to be any good to anybody...

21:03.333 --> 21:04.322
not even yourself.

21:04.333 --> 21:06.870
Look at me. You've
got one hell of a nerve

21:06.875 --> 21:09.366
thinking you're responsible
for what happened.

21:09.375 --> 21:11.866
Mike was the expert
climber, not you.

21:11.875 --> 21:13.866
Mike made the mistake.
Not you.

21:13.875 --> 21:14.864
You don't understand.

21:14.875 --> 21:16.365
No, I don't.

21:16.375 --> 21:18.866
I don't understand how you
can go on blaming yourself.

21:18.875 --> 21:20.365
You didn't push her, did you?

21:20.375 --> 21:22.366
Yes! Yes, I did.

21:22.375 --> 21:26.368
I pushed her away when she
needed something from me.

21:26.375 --> 21:28.366
I hurt her...
and she fell.

21:28.375 --> 21:31.913
And there wasn't anything you
could do to save her, was there?

21:32.917 --> 21:34.908
It's not as simple as that.

21:34.917 --> 21:36.373
You know something?

21:36.375 --> 21:38.366
The funny thing
about running away

21:38.375 --> 21:40.912
is that you've got to take
yourself with you.

21:40.917 --> 21:43.374
Look, Nikki, there's something
I want you to understand.

21:44.375 --> 21:46.411
What?

21:46.417 --> 21:48.408
What is it?

22:03.917 --> 22:05.407
What are those?

22:18.417 --> 22:21.409
I have it arranged...
just in case.

22:24.417 --> 22:27.454
And you cooperated
so beautifully.

22:27.458 --> 22:29.949
She's a man.

22:29.959 --> 22:31.449
He's a killer.

22:38.458 --> 22:40.449
Murdoc.

22:47.458 --> 22:48.447
His pictures.

22:48.458 --> 22:50.449
His calling card.

22:50.458 --> 22:52.995
That's impossible.

22:54.458 --> 22:55.994
He's dead.

22:57.001 --> 22:58.457
Murdoc's dead.

22:58.458 --> 22:59.994
Not quite, MacGyver!

23:04.458 --> 23:07.495
It's your turn to burn,
MacGyver!

23:11.001 --> 23:12.992
MacGyver!

23:22.083 --> 23:24.074
Remember me, MacGyver?

23:24.083 --> 23:26.620
When last we parted,
I had a couple of broken bones

23:26.625 --> 23:29.617
and you left me with
a whole lot of burnt flesh!

23:29.625 --> 23:31.616
I saw that maniac
at Ellard's store.

23:31.625 --> 23:32.614
That's Murdoc.

23:32.625 --> 23:35.082
He's not your normal
professional killer.

23:39.083 --> 23:41.074
Get ready to break for the door.

23:51.625 --> 23:54.116
Where are you going?

23:54.125 --> 23:55.114
Look out!

23:55.125 --> 23:57.116
Oh!

23:58.625 --> 24:00.115
No!

24:02.125 --> 24:04.116
Get the door!

24:14.125 --> 24:15.114
Go, run!

24:15.125 --> 24:17.116
Get in the jeep!

24:29.667 --> 24:31.157
Your car or mine?

24:31.166 --> 24:32.155
Mine.

24:33.667 --> 24:35.658
Oh, no.
We'll take yours.

24:36.667 --> 24:37.656
Keys.

24:40.667 --> 24:43.659
That fire won't keep him
stalled for long.

24:54.709 --> 24:56.165
This guy's a nut case.

24:56.166 --> 24:57.155
Yeah, no kidding.

25:02.166 --> 25:04.157
Oh, God.

25:06.709 --> 25:07.698
Wait a minute.

25:07.709 --> 25:08.698
Quiet. Quiet!

25:10.208 --> 25:11.698
What's that noise?

25:16.709 --> 25:18.700
That's bad news.

25:39.750 --> 25:41.206
Come on.

26:09.792 --> 26:11.248
That jerk.

26:11.250 --> 26:13.241
He's nuts!

26:13.250 --> 26:14.239
Wait a minute.

26:14.250 --> 26:15.786
Come on!

26:15.792 --> 26:18.249
He's probably halfway down
the trail by now. Look.

26:22.250 --> 26:24.241
He's mined the whole road
going out.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.286
Mines?

26:26.291 --> 26:28.782
He carries around
mines with him?

26:28.792 --> 26:31.784
How on earth did you get
mixed up with this guy?

26:31.792 --> 26:34.283
Wrong place, wrong time...

26:34.291 --> 26:36.282
it's a long story.

26:39.792 --> 26:41.282
What now?

26:41.291 --> 26:43.782
MacGyver, he's going
to be on us.

26:43.792 --> 26:45.282
Get with it.

26:45.291 --> 26:46.280
There's no telling
how many mines

26:46.834 --> 26:47.823
he set down
the road there.

26:47.834 --> 26:50.280
The only way
to go is up.

26:50.291 --> 26:51.827
The last thing we need
is some madman

26:51.834 --> 26:54.280
with a flame-thrower
on our backs.

26:54.291 --> 26:56.828
Grab the jumper cables.
They're in the back.

27:13.834 --> 27:15.324
What are you going
to do with these?

27:15.333 --> 27:17.324
Hook them
to this battery.

27:19.333 --> 27:21.324
Then I'll wire the whole thing
to that radio antenna

27:21.834 --> 27:24.826
and make a kind of, arc welder.

27:50.875 --> 27:53.366
Hurry, MacGyver.

27:53.375 --> 27:54.865
I hear him coming.

28:02.875 --> 28:05.912
Go!

28:20.917 --> 28:22.373
It's not over.

28:49.959 --> 28:52.416
So we've knocked out
his flame thrower.

28:52.417 --> 28:53.406
But something tells me

28:53.417 --> 28:54.406
this guy doesn't
give up easily.

28:54.417 --> 28:55.953
No, he doesn't.

28:57.959 --> 28:59.415
We're gonna need some help.

28:59.417 --> 29:00.953
Oh, really?

29:00.959 --> 29:03.416
Brilliant deduction.

29:03.417 --> 29:04.953
You know, unless
you're close

29:04.959 --> 29:06.950
personal friends
of Smokey the Bear,

29:06.959 --> 29:07.948
we're not going
to find much help

29:08.458 --> 29:09.948
between here and the top
of this mountain.

29:09.959 --> 29:13.952
Come on. I've got
to make a phone call.

29:13.959 --> 29:15.950
A phone call?!

29:26.458 --> 29:28.449
How do you plan on
making this call?

29:28.458 --> 29:30.449
Well, two to one
Ellard's gabbing to somebody

29:31.001 --> 29:31.990
down at the store.

29:32.458 --> 29:34.449
Uh, lend me your bracelet
and your belt.

29:34.458 --> 29:35.994
What for?

29:36.001 --> 29:39.448
I'm gonna climb up
and tap an SOS into the line.

29:39.458 --> 29:41.449
Ellard's a Navy man.

29:41.458 --> 29:43.449
Hopefully, he'll pick up on it.

29:43.458 --> 29:44.447
If he's on the line.

29:44.458 --> 29:46.494
Well, it's the best I can do.

29:46.500 --> 29:49.992
With any luck,
he'll call for help.

29:50.001 --> 29:50.990
What can I do to help?

29:51.500 --> 29:53.491
Cross your fingers.

30:56.041 --> 30:59.533
Oh, Buyy is a lady-killer,
you know that.

30:59.542 --> 31:02.033
Buyy?! Are you chipped?

31:02.041 --> 31:03.531
Have a good day,
Margaret.

31:03.542 --> 31:05.578
Well, I bet you my bottom dollar

31:05.583 --> 31:07.574
he's over at Helen's place
right now.

31:07.583 --> 31:08.572
Think so? Yeah.

31:08.583 --> 31:10.574
And I don't mean for tea.

31:13.041 --> 31:15.032
What's that confounded
clicking going on?

31:15.041 --> 31:16.577
Huh? Do you hear that?

31:20.041 --> 31:21.030
Wait...

31:21.041 --> 31:22.577
Wait, that's an SOS.

31:22.583 --> 31:24.039
Son of a gun.

31:24.041 --> 31:25.030
That's an SOS!

31:25.041 --> 31:26.577
Naw... Don't you tell me.

31:26.583 --> 31:28.574
I was a signal man,
20 years active service, Bub.

31:28.583 --> 31:30.073
Now hush up.

31:30.083 --> 31:33.075
W-I...

31:37.083 --> 31:39.074
Widowmaker.

31:39.083 --> 31:42.075
M-A...

31:47.625 --> 31:48.614
Oh, MacGyver!

31:49.625 --> 31:51.081
Is it working?

31:51.083 --> 31:52.619
There's no way to tell yet.

32:09.125 --> 32:11.116
MacGyver...

32:11.125 --> 32:13.116
you're about to be disconnected.

32:29.667 --> 32:30.656
MacGyver! Get down!

32:42.125 --> 32:44.116
All right, let's go.

32:44.125 --> 32:46.161
There's no place
else to run.

32:46.667 --> 32:49.158
Yes, there is: up.

33:41.208 --> 33:43.199
Oh, no.

33:50.208 --> 33:51.744
Helen, Pete here.

33:51.750 --> 33:53.206
Call the DSX.

33:53.208 --> 33:55.745
Tell them Murdoc is alive.

33:55.750 --> 33:57.741
That's right.

33:57.750 --> 33:59.206
A what?

33:59.208 --> 34:02.200
An SOS from who?

34:02.208 --> 34:04.745
Ellard?

34:04.750 --> 34:06.240
Oh, no.

34:06.250 --> 34:08.241
Listen, I want a chopper
waiting for me

34:08.250 --> 34:10.241
at the heliport in ten minutes.

34:10.250 --> 34:12.241
That's right.
I'm going up to Widow Canyon.

34:12.250 --> 34:13.739
Murdoc's up there!

34:13.750 --> 34:14.739
He's after MacGyver.

34:31.792 --> 34:34.248
So, what do you think?

34:37.250 --> 34:40.242
MacGyver, what's
the matter with you?

34:40.250 --> 34:42.241
Nothing.

34:42.250 --> 34:43.786
I'm all right.

34:43.792 --> 34:46.784
Somehow we got to find
a way down there.

34:46.792 --> 34:48.783
That's 1,200 feet
of vertical face.

34:48.792 --> 34:50.282
Look, if we don't
find a way,

34:50.291 --> 34:53.283
our only other alternative
is Murdoc and his rifle.

34:53.291 --> 34:55.282
There's one chance.

34:55.291 --> 34:57.782
There's cover below Widow Ledge.

34:57.792 --> 35:01.785
But we'd have to free climb
Broomstick Crack to get to it.

35:01.792 --> 35:02.781
Free climb?

35:03.291 --> 35:05.282
I know.

35:05.291 --> 35:07.282
I'm not looking forward
to it, either.

35:35.333 --> 35:36.823
All right.

35:36.834 --> 35:39.826
Keep coming, Nikki.
You're doing good.

35:40.333 --> 35:41.322
Come on.

35:41.333 --> 35:42.823
That's it.

35:42.834 --> 35:46.326
Okay. Hold me. Hold me.

35:46.333 --> 35:47.869
No, no, no, come on.

35:47.875 --> 35:49.331
Nikki, you're doing fine.

35:49.333 --> 35:51.324
Just take it easy,
an inch at a time.

36:15.875 --> 36:18.366
Sorry I got you into this.

36:18.375 --> 36:22.368
That's what I get
for crashing your party.

36:41.375 --> 36:42.911
You all right?

36:44.375 --> 36:45.911
Falling!

36:53.417 --> 36:54.907
Yeah.

36:56.917 --> 37:00.409
It was Mike's.

37:00.417 --> 37:02.408
This is where she fell.

37:06.417 --> 37:08.954
Wait here.

37:27.959 --> 37:30.951
MacGyver?

37:36.458 --> 37:37.447
MacGyver!

37:38.959 --> 37:41.450
Stay put!

37:41.458 --> 37:42.948
Don't move.

37:42.959 --> 37:44.950
I'm all right.

37:46.001 --> 37:48.447
I got Mike's rope.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.992
MacGyver... you all right?

38:36.500 --> 38:39.492
All right,
stick this around your waist.

38:40.500 --> 38:42.491
Go ahead. Toss it.
I'm ready.

39:13.542 --> 39:15.533
Okay, here I come.

39:16.542 --> 39:19.033
That's it, Nikki.

39:19.041 --> 39:22.033
Keep coming. Come on.

39:41.583 --> 39:44.040
Oh, finally.

39:45.583 --> 39:49.576
That wasn't so bad, was it?

39:49.583 --> 39:53.576
Sit down, will you?
Stay back.

39:53.583 --> 39:56.074
What's this?

39:56.083 --> 39:58.574
It's a chalk bag.

39:58.583 --> 40:00.574
It was Mike's, too.

40:00.583 --> 40:03.074
Climbers use it
to keep their hands dry.

40:07.625 --> 40:09.616
What's this?

40:12.083 --> 40:14.074
It's part of her harness.

40:17.625 --> 40:20.082
You mean it just came off?

40:24.083 --> 40:27.120
So that's what happened,
isn't it, MacGyver?

40:29.625 --> 40:32.617
Something like that.

40:32.625 --> 40:34.616
So it wasn't your fault.

40:36.625 --> 40:39.116
Is that all I have
to tell myself?

40:39.125 --> 40:41.616
No, more. The truth.

40:41.625 --> 40:44.116
You were her friend. You did
all that you could do.

40:44.125 --> 40:46.662
It wasn't enough, was it?

40:47.125 --> 40:48.661
MacGyver, you can't
bring her back.

40:48.667 --> 40:50.123
Even if you could
relive the moment,

40:50.125 --> 40:51.661
Mike still would
have fallen.

40:51.667 --> 40:54.124
Please, come back
to the present.

40:54.125 --> 40:57.663
Murdoc is still
after us.

40:57.667 --> 41:00.659
There's a ledge
right below us...

41:00.667 --> 41:03.659
where we can hide out of sight.

41:05.125 --> 41:09.667
Put some of this on your hands.

41:09.667 --> 41:12.158
Then we stay put, right?

41:12.166 --> 41:13.656
Right.

41:51.709 --> 41:53.199
That's it, Nikki.

41:53.208 --> 41:55.199
Keep coming.

41:55.208 --> 41:57.699
Come on.

41:57.709 --> 41:59.199
You're all right.
I got you.

41:59.208 --> 42:01.699
Oh, the things I
get into with you.

42:03.208 --> 42:05.699
Thanks, friend.

42:06.750 --> 42:09.742
Anytime.

42:09.750 --> 42:11.206
Now what?

42:11.208 --> 42:13.199
We're gonna need
climbing harnesses.

42:13.208 --> 42:15.199
We can make it
out of this rope.

42:15.208 --> 42:16.744
Are you kidding me?

42:16.750 --> 42:19.207
I thought we were just
gonna wait this out.

42:19.208 --> 42:21.199
Well, we are,
but we're still gonna have

42:21.208 --> 42:22.744
to climb up
after they nail Murdoc.

42:23.208 --> 42:25.199
Up? You never said
anything about up.

42:26.750 --> 42:29.241
You're expecting a sky hook?

42:31.250 --> 42:33.241
That might be nice.

42:33.250 --> 42:35.741
Mind if I drop in?

42:37.250 --> 42:39.241
Oh, no, no...

42:48.792 --> 42:49.781
Nikki?

42:49.792 --> 42:51.248
MacGyver!

43:00.792 --> 43:02.248
I gotcha.

43:09.792 --> 43:11.282
Say good-bye, MacGyver!

43:13.291 --> 43:17.284
MacGyver!

43:21.291 --> 43:22.280
I got you!

43:22.291 --> 43:23.280
I can't...

43:23.291 --> 43:24.781
Just hold on.

43:28.834 --> 43:29.823
All right, now, hold on.

43:29.834 --> 43:31.825
Hold on? You hold on.

43:31.834 --> 43:33.290
MacGyver, you can't!

43:33.291 --> 43:35.282
Just grab on to my wrists.

43:35.291 --> 43:36.827
Go ahead. Do it!

43:38.834 --> 43:39.823
That's it.

43:39.834 --> 43:40.823
Now the other one.

43:40.834 --> 43:42.290
I can't!

43:42.291 --> 43:43.827
Walk!

43:45.291 --> 43:48.328
Now, press your feet
into the rock.

43:48.333 --> 43:51.325
Just walk yourself up.

43:51.333 --> 43:52.322
Walk!

44:04.333 --> 44:05.823
You okay?

44:08.333 --> 44:10.870
How about yourself?

44:11.875 --> 44:13.866
Good.

44:14.333 --> 44:15.869
Real good.

44:28.375 --> 44:30.366
No way,

44:30.375 --> 44:32.366
MacGyver, forget it.

44:32.375 --> 44:34.866
Come on, you got down
here, didn't you?

44:34.875 --> 44:37.366
We'll have these
harnesses on the way up.

44:37.375 --> 44:40.867
You go up. I'm staying put
till the cavalry arrives.

44:40.875 --> 44:43.867
Look, I don't know if
the SOS got through.

44:44.375 --> 44:48.368
And even if it did, it'll take
them hours to de-mine that road.

44:48.375 --> 44:50.912
I can wait.

44:50.917 --> 44:54.364
Come on, Nikki. Where's
your spirit of adventure?

44:54.375 --> 44:56.366
I left it back at Pete's cabin.

44:56.375 --> 44:58.366
Okay.

45:00.375 --> 45:01.911
What are you doing?

45:01.917 --> 45:04.374
I told you,
I'm not climbing out.

45:04.375 --> 45:05.364
I heard you.

45:05.375 --> 45:07.912
This'll keep you from
rolling off the ledge,

45:07.917 --> 45:09.908
if you happen to fall
asleep tonight.

45:09.917 --> 45:11.908
Tonight? MacGyver, you...

45:11.917 --> 45:13.407
you are not gonna
leave me here.

45:13.917 --> 45:16.408
Oh, I'll be back with
a chopper in the morning.

45:17.917 --> 45:20.909
One minute you can't even
look down the mountain,

45:20.917 --> 45:24.409
and the next minute
you're a mountain goat.

45:31.959 --> 45:33.950
I'm glad that you're back
among the living.

45:33.959 --> 45:34.948
Really, I am.

45:35.417 --> 45:37.954
I only wish you could do it
with a little balance.

45:37.959 --> 45:39.950
These extreme changes
are not good.

45:39.959 --> 45:41.950
I'll work on it.

45:42.959 --> 45:45.951
Now, like I taught you:
by the numbers.

45:45.959 --> 45:47.950
By the numbers.

45:50.959 --> 45:52.950
All right.

45:52.959 --> 45:54.449
Belay on.

45:58.458 --> 45:59.447
Climbing.

45:59.959 --> 46:00.948
Climb on.
