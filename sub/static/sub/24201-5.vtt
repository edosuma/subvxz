01:36.416 --> 01:39.458
If the story of the Baudelaire orphans
was a car trip,

01:39.541 --> 01:43.791
it would be unpleasant, uncomfortable,
and interminably long.

01:47.791 --> 01:50.583
This car trip has been interminably long.

01:50.666 --> 01:52.875
Who knew the Hinterlands were so far away?

01:52.958 --> 01:55.375
That's why they're called Hinterlands.

01:55.458 --> 01:58.916
Nobody likes a backseat driver.
Tell me when that turn is coming up.

02:02.458 --> 02:05.958
My name is Lemony Snicket,
and I have the sad undertaking

02:06.041 --> 02:08.250
of chronicling the lives
of the Baudelaire orphans,

02:08.333 --> 02:14.416
whose long car trip will soon end here,
in the barely picturesque village of VFD.

02:15.791 --> 02:19.333
Before long, they'll find themselves
bewildered and bedeviled

02:19.416 --> 02:22.416
in the town's attractive
if drafty town hall.

02:23.291 --> 02:27.458
Desperate and despondent near this
prominent but off-putting landmark

02:27.541 --> 02:29.208
known as Fowl Fountain.

02:30.583 --> 02:33.250
It is the Baudelaires' destiny
to arrive here.

02:33.333 --> 02:35.125
But you could be someplace else.

02:35.208 --> 02:38.458
And within moments,
you'll most certainly wish you were.

02:44.833 --> 02:47.250
"It takes a village to raise a child."

02:47.916 --> 02:49.833
What a lovely, lovely aphorism.

02:49.916 --> 02:52.500
An aphorism is a phrase that can
sound mysterious,

02:52.583 --> 02:54.458
but, in fact, is very wise.

02:54.541 --> 02:55.625
We know what aphorism means.

02:55.708 --> 02:57.833
Then perhaps you'll know this one means

02:57.916 --> 03:01.833
the responsibility of raising young people
belongs to every member of a community.

03:01.916 --> 03:04.708
That's exactly what's going to happen
to you in the village of VFD.

03:04.791 --> 03:06.500
Instead of having one guardian,

03:06.583 --> 03:09.208
who could be murdered
or end up in cahoots with a villain,

03:09.291 --> 03:11.250
you'll have hundreds of people
caring for you.

03:11.333 --> 03:12.333
What could go wrong?

03:12.416 --> 03:14.833
Everything's already gone wrong.
We've lost our friends twice.

03:14.916 --> 03:17.458
Yes, well...

03:18.083 --> 03:21.291
Would you look at this brochure?
It has pictures.

03:24.625 --> 03:27.791
An entire village will be
in charge of us? That's a lot of people.

03:27.875 --> 03:31.083
I imagine they'll draw lots
like in that Shirley Jackson story.

03:31.166 --> 03:34.083
Normally, I prefer
a more traditional family structure,

03:34.166 --> 03:37.250
but for some unknown reason,
neither the individual guardian

03:37.333 --> 03:39.541
or the academic institution
is working for you.

03:39.625 --> 03:41.208
The reason isn't unknown. It's Olaf.

03:41.291 --> 03:43.500
He follows us everywhere.
He kidnapped the Quagmires.

03:43.583 --> 03:45.416
- Those poor twins.
- Triplets.

03:45.500 --> 03:48.041
Twins. Their brother's death
changes their birth identity.

03:48.125 --> 03:49.791
- No, it doesn't.
- It hardly matters.

03:49.875 --> 03:52.541
Thanks to the constant coverage
in my wife's newspaper,

03:52.625 --> 03:54.750
I'm sure Count Omar will be captured
in no time at all.

03:54.833 --> 03:57.083
- Olaf.
- Yes, I meant to say Omar.

03:57.166 --> 04:00.500
Besides, I doubt he'd be able to find you
way out in the Hinterlands.

04:00.583 --> 04:03.250
It would take an interminably long time.

04:07.875 --> 04:11.541
We've followed those Baudelaires
for an interminably long time.

04:11.625 --> 04:13.041
Isn't it marvelous?

04:13.125 --> 04:15.000
There's nothing like a trip
in a getaway car.

04:15.083 --> 04:17.416
I needed a getaway from that dirty,
grimy city

04:17.500 --> 04:19.083
and all the people after me there.

04:20.208 --> 04:22.375
Be honest. What do you think of my hat?

04:22.458 --> 04:24.708
- You look beautiful.
- I wish I had skin like yours.

04:24.791 --> 04:27.000
- I wish I was wearing your skin.
- You look nice.

04:27.083 --> 04:30.208
Don't look now,
but someone's following us.

04:30.291 --> 04:33.583
I said don't look. Never mind.

04:33.666 --> 04:37.166
Oh, no. Is it the paparazzi or the press?

04:37.250 --> 04:40.041
Or my husband?
His lawyers have been calling.

04:40.125 --> 04:41.625
It's a taxi. About a mile back.

04:41.708 --> 04:43.625
He's been behind us
an interminably long time.

04:43.708 --> 04:46.791
You didn't think to mention
someone is following us?

04:46.875 --> 04:49.291
- I wanted it to be a surprise?
- Is it the police?

04:49.375 --> 04:51.041
Why would the police take a taxi?

04:51.125 --> 04:53.708
Whoever it is,
they seem to be obeying the speed limit.

04:53.791 --> 04:57.958
There's only one taxi driver I know
who cares about obeying the law.

04:58.041 --> 05:03.750
There's a shortcut up here someplace.
Let's see Snicket try to follow us now.

05:08.375 --> 05:11.166
He just made
a left-hand turn without signaling.

05:11.250 --> 05:14.916
That man's villainy knows no bounds.
But we'll catch up soon.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.541
He's after the Baudelaires,
and we know where they're headed.

05:18.583 --> 05:22.875
VFD. What a charming fountain.

05:22.958 --> 05:24.833
Don't fountains typically have water?

05:24.916 --> 05:27.250
Typically, but this is a dry county.
There's no water.

05:27.333 --> 05:29.666
It means there's no alcohol.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.791
Tomato, to-mah-to.
Now, you Baudelaires wait here

05:32.875 --> 05:35.166
while I go into town hall
and finalize your paperwork.

05:35.250 --> 05:36.500
Then I'll be leaving you.

05:36.583 --> 05:38.375
I have a long drive back to the city,

05:38.458 --> 05:40.500
and my wife and I have tickets
to the theater.

05:40.583 --> 05:42.916
Sunny, don't feed the pigeons.

05:44.500 --> 05:47.375
I've read three books about crows.
They're harmless.

05:47.458 --> 05:50.000
There's a word
for a large number of crows.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.500
I can't think of it.

05:52.875 --> 05:55.291
- That only applies to larks.
- I hope we're in the right place.

05:55.375 --> 05:57.291
This town is called VFD.
It has to be connected.

05:57.375 --> 05:59.958
We had the wrong VFD at Veblen Hall.
We could have the wrong VFD.

06:00.041 --> 06:02.000
I hope Duncan and Isadora are here.

06:02.083 --> 06:04.958
Me, too. Maybe we can ask
someone if they've seen them.

06:05.041 --> 06:07.416
You mean...

06:07.500 --> 06:10.000
Owls say...

06:10.083 --> 06:11.833
It's wonderful
you're practicing bird calls,

06:11.916 --> 06:13.333
but you have an appointment.

06:13.416 --> 06:14.833
The Council of Elders will see you.

06:14.916 --> 06:17.125
- The Council of Elders?
- Will see you now.

06:17.208 --> 06:20.750
They know everything there is to know
about VFD. They're as wise as...

06:23.041 --> 06:27.208
What's that bird known
to be mysterious and wise? The...

06:27.291 --> 06:29.125
- If they know everything...
- They can help.

06:29.208 --> 06:31.833
A heron! No, a mockingbird.

06:31.916 --> 06:33.458
Goodbye. Thank you for the ride.

06:33.541 --> 06:35.541
A grackle? Um, no, it'll come to me.

06:36.208 --> 06:38.125
Perhaps it's some kind of booby?

06:39.750 --> 06:41.500
Did I see a saloon around here somewhere?

06:44.625 --> 06:49.000
This saloon is the perfect place
to hide out while we hunt the Baudelaires.

06:49.083 --> 06:52.916
Ooh, there's a pole.
Are you sure this isn't more of a club?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.250
That's a fire pole, love.

06:54.333 --> 06:56.833
This saloon was a firehouse
until it was shut down

06:56.916 --> 06:59.583
under mysterious
and complicated circumstances.

07:00.166 --> 07:03.500
Oh, I see they haven't changed
the decor a bit. Barkeep!

07:05.375 --> 07:08.833
It looks like no one's been
in this place for a long time.

07:09.541 --> 07:10.958
Maybe it's a dry county.

07:11.041 --> 07:14.458
Oh, sweet, fresh country...

07:17.000 --> 07:19.916
I can't...

07:20.000 --> 07:23.291
Breathe, breathe.
Esmé, you sound like that banker.

07:30.666 --> 07:34.291
Hello? Anybody here?

07:38.583 --> 07:39.458
Hello?

07:42.708 --> 07:45.666
Hello? Anybody here? Hello?

07:45.750 --> 07:48.041
Howdy!
What can I get for you,

07:48.125 --> 07:50.208
total stranger who I've never seen before?

07:50.291 --> 07:53.416
I would like your strongest
and coldest sarsaparilla.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.416
One sarsaparilla coming up!

07:57.750 --> 07:58.791
Oh.

07:59.750 --> 08:01.125
Here you go.

08:01.208 --> 08:05.000
So, tell me, traveler,
what brings you to these parts?

08:05.083 --> 08:07.291
How was the road?
Did you bring any childrens?

08:07.375 --> 08:10.333
I'm delighted to tell you
the Baudelaires are now yours.

08:10.416 --> 08:12.916
- That was easy.
- Yours and everyone else's.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.541
I've delivered them to this town's
aphorism-based guardianship program,

08:16.625 --> 08:18.791
It Takes a Village. Mazel tov!

08:18.875 --> 08:20.500
L'Heimlich!

08:21.375 --> 08:24.125
I always wanted orphans.

08:28.375 --> 08:32.875
This morning, I thought
I was just a lonely, single bartender...

08:34.457 --> 08:36.875
And now I have a fortune of childrens,

08:36.957 --> 08:39.875
or whatever the word is
for a large number of 'em.

08:41.750 --> 08:45.458
Last call. Anything else I can get you
aside from the check?

08:45.541 --> 08:47.416
No, I'll be getting back to the city.

08:47.500 --> 08:51.500
Thank you for this refreshing
yet substantially overpriced beverage.

08:51.583 --> 08:53.708
Enjoy the communal raising of children.

08:53.791 --> 08:57.541
My wife and I decided to raise
Edgar and Albert on our own.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.541
It took one trip to a kibbutz
to realize that...

09:05.625 --> 09:06.625
Gesundheit.

09:11.208 --> 09:13.416
The Baudelaires are here.

09:13.500 --> 09:16.416
They've been placed
under the care of the village.

09:16.500 --> 09:19.125
We heard. We were next to you,
behind this dusty bar.

09:19.208 --> 09:21.041
You, bring me the red herring.

09:21.125 --> 09:23.416
You two, bring some rags for dusting.

09:23.500 --> 09:28.666
I do not want one more speck of dust
invading the nostrils of the woman I love.

09:28.750 --> 09:31.333
I love when you talk
about my mucus membranes.

09:31.416 --> 09:34.708
Oh, I'm not sure which I love more,
your membranes or your mucus.

09:34.791 --> 09:38.916
Oh, Esmé, I'm going to give you everything
you never had back in the city.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.958
Darling, I was so wealthy,
I had everything I wanted.

09:42.041 --> 09:45.916
And now I'm squatting in a dusty saloon
with a bunch of actors.

09:48.250 --> 09:49.625
I am the luckiest woman alive.

09:53.833 --> 09:57.208
That fish weighs as much
as two kidnapped children.

09:57.291 --> 09:59.125
It certainly does.

09:59.208 --> 10:02.125
They're awfully quiet.
Should we have added more air holes?

10:02.208 --> 10:06.541
Ugh, they'll be fine. They're probably
hoarse from all that screaming.

10:06.625 --> 10:08.458
But if Snicket's followed us,

10:08.541 --> 10:11.583
we'll need to stash them
somewhere less conspicuous.

10:11.666 --> 10:13.916
Less conspicuous
than a bright red statue of a fish?

10:14.000 --> 10:15.791
I know just the place.

10:15.875 --> 10:19.625
Now, while we're here, we can't risk
being recognized by the authorities.

10:19.708 --> 10:21.500
Darling, you're up.

10:21.583 --> 10:23.333
Costumes, everyone!

10:25.375 --> 10:27.625
- Costumes!
- Ooh.

10:29.500 --> 10:33.000
Now, this is a small town
filled with regular folk.

10:33.083 --> 10:37.375
We need to blend in with plain, normal,
upstanding, heartfelt, decent,

10:37.458 --> 10:39.791
simple, dependable, respectable people.

10:41.750 --> 10:43.416
The bonnet might be a bit much.

10:48.166 --> 10:52.083
The Council of Elders calls
this special town meeting to order.

10:52.166 --> 10:53.083
Hello, my dears.

10:53.166 --> 10:54.833
We're pleased you made it.

10:54.916 --> 10:58.541
Step onto the platform
so your Elders can get a good look at you.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.208
- Hello, I'm Violet...
- Silence!

11:00.291 --> 11:05.375
Rule number 902 states that no one
may talk while on the platform.

11:05.458 --> 11:09.416
Baudelaires, we know your story well.
The tragic death of your parents.

11:09.500 --> 11:12.458
The unfortunate loss
of numerous guardians.

11:12.541 --> 11:17.875
How you have been pursued relentlessly by
a wicked count out to steal your fortune.

11:17.958 --> 11:19.541
Your troubles end here.

11:19.625 --> 11:23.375
We recently made up
a new rule to solve all your problems.

11:23.458 --> 11:27.458
Rule number 9,833 states

11:27.541 --> 11:31.208
no villains will be allowed
within the city limits.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.958
You're safe at last.

11:33.041 --> 11:34.500
- I don't think...
- Silence!

11:34.583 --> 11:35.916
- Count Olaf...
- Silence.

11:36.916 --> 11:38.875
Silence, even for babies!

11:38.958 --> 11:41.458
Now, the next order of business.

11:41.541 --> 11:44.750
When children have guardians,
guardians make them do chores.

11:44.833 --> 11:47.458
We are all your guardians now.

11:47.541 --> 11:50.875
It follows that you will be
doing all of our chores.

11:50.958 --> 11:52.333
For the entire village.

11:54.708 --> 11:55.750
Any questions?

11:55.833 --> 11:57.416
- I beg your pardon, but...
- Silence!

11:57.500 --> 11:59.333
For the fourth and fifth time!

11:59.416 --> 12:03.583
How many times do we have to tell you
about rule number 902, hmm?

12:03.666 --> 12:07.666
What we meant was,
are there any questions from the town?

12:07.750 --> 12:09.916
- Mrs. Morrow?
- Thank you.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.291
I am all in favor
for the "It Takes a Village" program

12:13.375 --> 12:14.458
and others doing my chores.

12:14.541 --> 12:17.375
But these children were involved
in that kidnapping scandal.

12:17.458 --> 12:19.000
I don't want trouble in my town.

12:19.083 --> 12:22.625
- That wasn't a question.
- It was more of a statement.

12:22.708 --> 12:24.333
- Me, me!
- Man in plaid pants?

12:24.416 --> 12:26.208
Yes, I have a question.

12:26.291 --> 12:28.666
Where are these children going to live?

12:28.750 --> 12:30.625
It may take a village to raise a child,

12:30.708 --> 12:34.958
but I don't want noisy children
cluttering up my home, eh? Right?

12:35.041 --> 12:38.625
- Silence!
- Now, there's no need to fuss.

12:38.708 --> 12:43.750
The orphans will live with our handyman,
Hector. Isn't that right, Hector?

12:50.833 --> 12:52.166
I, uh...

12:52.250 --> 12:53.416
Hector?

12:53.500 --> 12:55.583
I...

12:57.708 --> 12:58.708
I...

13:04.333 --> 13:08.708
The Council of Elders takes
Hector's latest fainting spell to mean

13:08.791 --> 13:12.541
Hector will feed and clothe them
and teach them our rules,

13:12.625 --> 13:15.833
so they won't do terrible things
like talking on the platform!

13:15.916 --> 13:17.875
Isn't that right, Hector?

13:21.291 --> 13:22.291
Well, you...

13:23.041 --> 13:25.250
The Council hears
no objections.

13:25.333 --> 13:30.166
Now, the next item of business,
a report from the chief of police.

13:33.875 --> 13:36.666
- Ciao. Hello. I'm here...
- Esmé Squalor.

13:36.750 --> 13:39.333
If Esmé's here, so is Olaf.
And if Olaf is here...

13:39.416 --> 13:40.875
So are the Quagmires.

13:43.958 --> 13:49.458
Greetings, VFD. My name is
Officer Sabrina Pepper Anastasia Marigold.

13:49.541 --> 13:55.333
But you may call me Officer Luciana,
your new chief of police.

13:55.416 --> 13:59.500
What happened to the old chief of police?
I kind of liked that guy.

13:59.583 --> 14:00.833
He has a sore throat.

14:00.916 --> 14:03.500
He accidentally swallowed
a box of thumbtacks.

14:03.583 --> 14:05.125
We didn't hire a replacement.

14:06.333 --> 14:08.208
The agency sent me.

14:08.291 --> 14:12.083
VFD, I bring you protection and style.

14:12.166 --> 14:18.083
Enjoy my fabulous officious outfit
as I serve up piles and piles of justice.

14:18.166 --> 14:19.500
- We have to tell the Council...
- Silence!

14:19.583 --> 14:22.375
We can see your lips moving.

14:22.458 --> 14:26.041
Whispering is talking,
and there's no talking on the platform.

14:26.125 --> 14:29.791
- Unless you're chief of police.
- Unless you're chief of police.

14:29.875 --> 14:35.708
And as chief of police, I will make sure
that rule-breakers are severely punished.

14:35.791 --> 14:39.583
- That sounds perfect.
- I am big fan of severe punishment.

14:39.666 --> 14:45.083
In fact, I will personally take care of
people who break even the tiniest rule.

14:45.166 --> 14:47.666
- Hear! Hear!
- I like this chief of police!

14:47.750 --> 14:49.375
- She's very attractive.
- Aw.

14:49.458 --> 14:51.666
I admire her for her capabilities.

14:52.666 --> 14:53.708
Yeah!

14:57.666 --> 15:01.750
Grazie. Aw, so kind. Grazie.

15:02.833 --> 15:05.500
As you can see, we have eyes everywhere.

15:05.583 --> 15:07.750
And we are always watching.

15:09.125 --> 15:12.666
Now, off you go!
Good luck in your new home.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.291
- What do we do now?
- That's the trouble with small towns.

15:19.375 --> 15:21.333
Once you infiltrate the police,
not much to do.

15:21.416 --> 15:22.416
Vandalism?

15:22.500 --> 15:24.125
The Baudelaires will be
cleaning up this town.

15:24.208 --> 15:26.458
Maybe we could make it a little dirtier.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.125
Beat it out.

16:07.208 --> 16:09.833
Welcome
to the Firehouse Saloon.

16:09.916 --> 16:14.000
I have extremely pricey beverages
which you have to pay cash for.

16:16.583 --> 16:19.291
I'll take a tall glass
of Justice on the rocks

16:20.708 --> 16:23.500
with a garnish of
Your Wicked Schemes Stop Here.

16:28.375 --> 16:29.666
We're all out.

16:29.750 --> 16:32.833
But I can pour you a double shot
of You'll Never Take Me Alive.

16:37.250 --> 16:38.875
- You haven't changed.
- Thank you.

16:38.958 --> 16:41.125
New hat? It makes your head look funny.

16:46.666 --> 16:47.791
Yee-haw!

16:50.250 --> 16:51.291
I'll have what he's having.

16:51.375 --> 16:54.208
Who are you? Wait a minute.

16:54.291 --> 16:55.791
The smell of paste.

16:55.875 --> 16:58.541
The glassy-eyed stare of someone
who works with children.

16:58.625 --> 17:00.375
You're that school librarian.

17:00.458 --> 17:02.458
That was a long time ago.

17:02.541 --> 17:05.375
It wasn't that long ago.
It was actually a few...

17:05.458 --> 17:06.915
The jig is up, Olaf.

17:08.250 --> 17:09.083
Jig?

17:09.165 --> 17:13.458
It's a phrase which means your scheme
has been undone. As Dante said...

17:15.665 --> 17:17.000
Dante never said that.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.250
Ooh!

17:34.083 --> 17:35.958
Ow.

17:36.958 --> 17:39.166
- Where are the triplets?
- I thought they were twins.

17:39.250 --> 17:41.666
- Where are they?
- There's two of them, right?

17:41.750 --> 17:43.916
One writes poetry
and one cries all the time.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.125
We shouldn't do this here.

17:45.208 --> 17:47.625
Anyone could walk into this saloon
who's over 18.

17:49.208 --> 17:51.458
- You know what these are?
- Bracelet things of justice.

17:51.541 --> 17:53.625
- It's on the tip of my tongue.
- Time's up. Handcuffs.

17:53.708 --> 17:55.833
- Handcuffs! Who knew?
- Gag him.

17:55.916 --> 17:58.250
That's not my color.
I'm more of a spring-summer.

17:58.333 --> 18:01.041
You don't deserve to wear colors
that complement your complexion.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.416
- It's fun, isn't it?
- What?

18:04.500 --> 18:05.458
Getting your man.

18:05.541 --> 18:07.375
Question. Who is Dante?

18:07.458 --> 18:10.750
An Italian poet. 13th century.
He wrote The Divine Comedy.

18:10.833 --> 18:11.875
Oh.

18:15.083 --> 18:16.291
Sorry I fainted.

18:16.375 --> 18:18.958
The Elders are so scary,
they make me woozy.

18:19.041 --> 18:21.916
I'm excited you're staying with me.
I've never been a guardian.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.333
- Anything you need, let Hector know.
- Thanks. We really need your help.

18:25.416 --> 18:27.708
The chief of police
is our friends' kidnapper's girlfriend.

18:27.791 --> 18:29.666
His awful accomplices were there, too.

18:29.750 --> 18:31.875
Are you saying this
to make my day more scary?

18:31.958 --> 18:35.208
- Are you going to faint again?
- No. I'm getting ready to run.

18:35.291 --> 18:38.916
We should run in a random direction
and not stop until we're miles away.

18:39.666 --> 18:41.041
We came to find our friends.

18:41.125 --> 18:44.958
- We believe they're nearby.
- The only clue are the letters VFD.

18:45.041 --> 18:47.583
- We don't know what those stand for.
- Village of Fowl Devotees.

18:48.250 --> 18:49.583
That's what VFD stands for.

18:49.666 --> 18:51.916
- Fowl means birds.
- Murder! Sorry.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.958
That's the word I was thinking of.
Murder is a group of crows.

18:55.041 --> 18:57.291
There's not only murder in this town.
There's a secret.

18:57.375 --> 18:59.583
- It's connected with Olaf.
- And our missing friends.

19:01.083 --> 19:03.000
I have no idea
what you're saying right now.

19:03.083 --> 19:06.083
You can explain it on the way to my house.
It's a mile away as the crows fly.

19:06.166 --> 19:07.458
You mean "as the crow flies,"

19:07.541 --> 19:09.541
the shortest distance between two points.

19:09.625 --> 19:12.083
No, literally, I mean as the crows fly.

19:33.166 --> 19:37.541
Awesome!
That's a word that means inspiring awe.

19:38.541 --> 19:40.750
Every morning,
the crows roost in the town square.

19:40.833 --> 19:43.083
Every evening,
they migrate to Nevermore Tree

19:43.166 --> 19:44.166
in the backyard of your new home.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.083
Come on. Tell me your story on the way.

19:46.166 --> 19:49.833
- It's a long story.
- That's okay. It's a long walk.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
I'm sorry I'm crying,
but that is an unbelievably sad story.

19:55.083 --> 19:56.666
I bet you're not halfway done.

19:56.750 --> 20:00.000
We won't be done until we rescue
the Quagmires and escape from Olaf.

20:00.083 --> 20:01.583
I wish I could help.

20:01.666 --> 20:05.208
You can explain to the Council of Elders
Olaf must be somewhere in town.

20:05.291 --> 20:08.083
I meant some way I could help
that wouldn't be scary.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.666
- We'd be there with you.
- The Council knows you.

20:10.750 --> 20:12.291
They'd believe you if you told them.

20:12.375 --> 20:13.791
It doesn't matter if they know you.

20:13.875 --> 20:15.958
They knew my ma,
and they didn't believe her.

20:16.041 --> 20:18.333
Now I live alone on the outskirts of town.

20:18.416 --> 20:19.500
What happened to your ma?

20:24.500 --> 20:26.875
It's too painful. I can't talk about it.

20:27.541 --> 20:29.625
I'm sorry. I'd like to help,

20:29.708 --> 20:32.666
but this place has so many rules,
I wouldn't know where to start.

20:32.750 --> 20:34.750
You have to keep
a lot of secrets in this town.

20:34.833 --> 20:36.416
Here, let me show you.

21:06.375 --> 21:08.958
- What do you think? Isn't she beautiful?
- What is it?

21:10.083 --> 21:12.208
- It's our ticket out of this town.
- But what is it?

21:12.791 --> 21:14.833
It's a self-sustaining
hot air mobile home.

21:14.916 --> 21:19.125
- A self-sustaining hot air mobile home.
- A self-sustaining hot air mobile home.

21:19.208 --> 21:20.375
Like a hot air balloon?

21:20.458 --> 21:23.083
It's the same idea,
only each basket is its own room.

21:23.166 --> 21:24.458
It's like an entire flying house.

21:24.541 --> 21:27.333
Or it will be,
once I run more tests on the engine.

21:27.416 --> 21:28.625
Did you invent it?

21:28.708 --> 21:30.458
Rule number 67 states

21:30.541 --> 21:33.250
no citizen is allowed to use
or build mechanical devices.

21:33.333 --> 21:36.208
The Council of Elders instructed me
to destroy our inventing materials,

21:36.291 --> 21:37.291
but I brought them here.

21:37.375 --> 21:38.958
I've been working on this device since.

21:39.041 --> 21:40.958
I've loaded the baskets
with all the necessities.

21:41.041 --> 21:42.125
Is that a library?

21:44.916 --> 21:47.083
So rule number 108 bans all books,

21:47.166 --> 21:49.291
except for a boring one
called The Littlest Elf,

21:49.375 --> 21:51.000
and of course, the book of VFD rules.

21:51.083 --> 21:53.333
The Council told me to burn the rest,
but I hid them

21:53.416 --> 21:54.541
so I have something to read.

21:55.416 --> 21:57.541
Oh, and I've packed plenty of food.

21:58.625 --> 22:01.708
What my sister means is she loves
crunchy foods that are fun to bite.

22:01.791 --> 22:05.041
Rule number 8,675 clearly states

22:05.125 --> 22:07.333
citizens can't use their mouths
for recreation.

22:08.500 --> 22:11.791
But I like crunchy foods, too.
I've got a basket full of Mexican turnips.

22:13.083 --> 22:15.500
You're very brave
to defy the Council of Elders.

22:15.583 --> 22:17.083
Only behind closed doors.

22:17.166 --> 22:19.333
When I'm in front of them,
all I do is faint,

22:19.416 --> 22:21.708
which is why I have to leave this place.
It's too scary.

22:21.791 --> 22:23.583
Plus the fainting is hard
on my lower back.

22:23.666 --> 22:24.500
Ah.

22:26.125 --> 22:29.750
Maybe you could come with me.
It's big enough for four or even six.

22:29.833 --> 22:32.458
The engine is self-sustaining.
It should last 100 years.

22:34.083 --> 22:36.833
Once we go up, we never have to come down.

22:37.833 --> 22:43.791
No more rules, no more VFD.
We could live up in the air forever.

22:43.875 --> 22:45.125
Forever?

22:45.208 --> 22:47.041
Don't you want to escape
your long, sad story?

22:47.125 --> 22:48.416
It's a marvelous invention.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.708
Maybe when we get
our friends out of danger.

22:50.791 --> 22:53.750
- And when Olaf is behind bars.
- Who knows when that will happen.

22:53.833 --> 22:59.041
Trapped. Caught like a trap in a rat.

23:00.291 --> 23:01.375
I can't sleep.

23:02.125 --> 23:05.083
These dark, dank walls are closing in.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.875
I call to you,
spirits of the jail cell, save me!

23:09.958 --> 23:11.375
Save me!

23:12.750 --> 23:17.208
How long has it been?
The days turn to months.

23:17.291 --> 23:19.375
It's been eight minutes.
Do you want some tea?

23:19.458 --> 23:22.166
No, thank you.
You always make it too bitter.

23:22.250 --> 23:24.291
I thought this jail had a deluxe cell.

23:24.375 --> 23:26.916
- This is the deluxe cell.
- That's bad news.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.291
Want some more bad news?
You'll crack eventually.

23:29.375 --> 23:30.416
For being offered tea?

23:30.500 --> 23:32.833
You've tried that on me for years.
It hardly ever works.

23:32.916 --> 23:35.166
You're going to tell us
where the Quagmires are.

23:35.250 --> 23:37.416
We expect the chief of police
to be back any minute.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.166
- Do you now?
- I do now.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.208
He or she will put you
in the hands of the authorities,

23:42.291 --> 23:45.625
and you'll spend a long time in a cell
of this quality or perhaps worse.

23:45.708 --> 23:46.708
Do you want to know why?

23:46.791 --> 23:48.833
Is this where you give
the big speech about...

23:48.916 --> 23:51.875
Because we represent
the true human tradition,

23:52.458 --> 23:56.041
the best chance of extinguishing
chaos and cruelty.

23:56.125 --> 23:59.333
We may be defeated, at least for a time.
But we will never disappear.

23:59.416 --> 24:03.000
Not so long as there are noble,
well-read people to take up the cause.

24:10.416 --> 24:11.791
You still believe that?

24:14.708 --> 24:19.916
Yes, I do. Now, where are the children?

24:25.333 --> 24:27.083
- Did he talk?
- Mostly about himself.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.958
- He won't tell us where the Quagmires are.
- I want to find them.

24:30.041 --> 24:32.416
We know they're nearby and alive.

24:32.500 --> 24:34.458
Olaf needs them to get their sapphires.

24:34.541 --> 24:37.291
Once we hand him to the chief of police,
we'll search the town.

24:37.375 --> 24:39.916
They must be so scared.
The Baudelaires, too.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.625
We all learn bravery the hard way, Olivia.

24:41.708 --> 24:44.000
I was scared when I joined the VFD.

24:44.500 --> 24:46.625
I was told memorizing
a certain poem might help.

24:46.708 --> 24:49.500
When my siblings and I reached
the VFD headquarters,

24:49.583 --> 24:51.833
we learned how to hit an olive
with a bow and arrow.

24:51.916 --> 24:54.041
We learned how to dance
the waltz and the watusi,

24:54.125 --> 24:55.416
and how to determine if a poison

24:55.500 --> 24:58.291
had been introduced into a cheese fondue
without tasting it.

24:58.375 --> 25:01.458
But we were there voluntarily.
We're volunteers.

25:07.541 --> 25:09.958
- More tea?
- Wait. Show me your tea leaves.

25:10.833 --> 25:12.166
You read fortunes now?

25:12.250 --> 25:14.333
I'm a librarian.
I read all sorts of things.

25:14.416 --> 25:15.583
And what do my tea leaves say?

25:16.291 --> 25:18.791
That you're a brave man
with a valid taxi driver's license

25:18.875 --> 25:20.708
and a book collection in the trunk.

25:20.791 --> 25:22.500
- Is that enough?
- I think so.

25:22.583 --> 25:25.125
It says soon our enemies will be defeated.

25:25.208 --> 25:29.458
- And what then? Marriage? Children?
- Only if we rescue them.

25:29.541 --> 25:33.000
And one night, if they're ready
to join... What was the poem?

25:33.083 --> 25:35.833
The one that you memorized
on your way to VFD headquarters?

25:38.791 --> 25:41.291
"When you drive away in secret,
you'll be a volunteer..."

25:41.375 --> 25:42.875
"So don't scream when we take you..."

25:42.958 --> 25:45.416
"The world is quiet here."

25:45.500 --> 25:49.166
Poetry? You'll stop at nothing
to make me talk.

25:49.250 --> 25:51.458
You take the gas station.
I'll hit the church.

25:51.541 --> 25:52.750
Those kids will be so busy cleaning,

25:52.833 --> 25:55.458
they won't have time
to foil the boss' plans.

25:55.541 --> 25:56.958
What about the fountain?

25:59.250 --> 26:01.208
I think we've done enough.

26:03.833 --> 26:06.333
It's been a long time
since anyone made us breakfast.

26:06.416 --> 26:07.458
Hector was right.

26:07.541 --> 26:10.458
Huevos rancheros taste delicious
even in desperate circumstances.

26:10.541 --> 26:11.833
They don't make anything less desperate.

26:11.916 --> 26:13.541
We have no idea
where to find the Quagmires.

26:13.625 --> 26:16.375
It was hard searching a penthouse.
We have an entire village.

26:16.458 --> 26:17.416
We have to keep trying.

26:17.500 --> 26:19.291
It's not as if a clue
will fall into our laps.

26:26.250 --> 26:27.625
What's this?

26:27.708 --> 26:29.625
- Poetry.
- Not just poetry, couplets.

26:29.708 --> 26:30.708
Isadora?

26:30.791 --> 26:32.083
"For sapphires,
we are held in here.

26:32.166 --> 26:33.333
Only you can end our fear."

26:33.416 --> 26:36.333
"Until dawn comes, we cannot speak.
No words can come from this sad beak."

26:37.791 --> 26:39.666
You look shocked. What did I miss?

26:39.750 --> 26:41.375
A message from our friends.

26:41.458 --> 26:44.791
There might be more than crows
in Nevermore Tree. Sunny, wait here.

26:49.625 --> 26:51.166
- Isadora!
- Duncan!

26:51.333 --> 26:52.833
- Isadora!
- Duncan!

26:53.750 --> 26:54.791
Quagmires.

26:56.708 --> 26:58.833
There are many expressions
to describe someone

26:58.916 --> 27:00.833
who is going about something
in the wrong way.

27:00.916 --> 27:02.458
"Making a mistake" is one way.

27:02.541 --> 27:05.375
"Screwing up" is another,
although it is a bit rude.

27:05.458 --> 27:06.958
"Attempting to rescue Lemony Snicket

27:07.041 --> 27:10.416
by writing letters to a congressperson
instead of digging an escape tunnel"

27:10.500 --> 27:12.666
is a third way,
although it is a bit too specific.

27:12.750 --> 27:17.416
But there is one expression that describes
the Baudelaires' situation perfectly,

27:17.500 --> 27:21.750
and as soon as the murder of crows
embarked on their morning migration...

27:27.666 --> 27:30.875
The Baudelaires saw that they
were barking up the wrong tree.

27:31.375 --> 27:33.958
- There's nothing up there.
- Nothing and nobody.

27:34.041 --> 27:36.708
It's the usual morning migration.
What were you expecting?

27:36.791 --> 27:39.791
I wasn't expecting anything. Just hoping.

27:39.875 --> 27:41.000
Carrier pigeons.

27:41.083 --> 27:43.291
Carrier pigeons are birds
that carry messages,

27:43.375 --> 27:45.208
based on their regular migration patterns.

27:45.291 --> 27:48.708
The Quagmires weren't up Nevermore Tree,
but their messages were.

27:48.791 --> 27:50.333
Maybe they were sent by carrier crow.

27:50.416 --> 27:53.250
That's what Isadora meant by
"No words can come from this sad beak."

27:53.333 --> 27:54.166
Crows can't talk.

27:54.250 --> 27:55.708
But maybe they can tell us
where they're hidden.

27:55.791 --> 27:58.500
Every morning, the murder of crows
flies into VFD to roost.

27:58.583 --> 28:01.375
We can find them.
We just need an excuse to search the town.

28:02.458 --> 28:04.708
Are you ready to do chores
for the entire town?

28:06.833 --> 28:11.250
The Council of Elders
is waiting for you. I, uh...

28:11.333 --> 28:14.541
I'm going to trim the hedges
and think about my mother.

28:14.625 --> 28:16.000
I'll see you at dinner.

28:17.166 --> 28:19.791
- Okay.
- There you are, children.

28:19.875 --> 28:22.791
Someone has been making messes
all over town.

28:22.875 --> 28:26.083
They TP'd our gas station,
egged our church,

28:26.166 --> 28:28.958
and scared our poor donkey.
Now he's in need of a bath.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.291
We have no idea who made these messes,

28:31.375 --> 28:34.833
although an eyewitness saw
two white-faced women, a bald man,

28:34.916 --> 28:39.625
a man with hooks for hands, and a person
of indeterminate gender near the scene.

28:39.708 --> 28:42.583
- But we know who's going to clean them.
- You are.

28:46.333 --> 28:48.416
If we search for the Quagmires
while we clean...

28:48.500 --> 28:49.750
Then doing chores is useful.

28:53.708 --> 28:57.541
All over the world, people tell themselves
doing chores is useful,

28:57.625 --> 29:01.291
just as they tell themselves
an apple is as delicious as a cookie

29:01.375 --> 29:04.333
or that television
is an important cultural art form.

29:06.250 --> 29:09.750
But even though the Baudelaires busied
themselves with many tedious chores,

29:09.833 --> 29:13.625
as the day wore on, they were
no closer to finding their friends.

29:13.708 --> 29:15.250
We're no closer to finding our friends.

29:15.333 --> 29:17.333
Maybe we can narrow our search.

29:17.416 --> 29:19.708
Olaf must be keeping them someplace
no one else would go.

29:20.625 --> 29:23.500
When you're done washing that donkey,
go to the Firehouse Saloon.

29:23.583 --> 29:26.416
It's been closed for years
because of rule number 18,

29:26.500 --> 29:29.833
which prohibits the pouring
and serving of sarsaparillas.

29:29.916 --> 29:33.416
No one ever goes inside.
So it could use a good dusting.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.416
We'll get right to it.

29:42.375 --> 29:44.083
- Duncan?
- Isadora?

29:45.416 --> 29:46.833
There's a fire pole.

29:51.958 --> 29:53.000
Quagmires?

29:55.416 --> 29:56.625
The red herring.

29:57.416 --> 29:59.208
- Duncan!
- Isadora!

30:00.333 --> 30:01.833
They're not answering.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.125
Grab the fin and pull.

30:04.208 --> 30:06.833
It's empty.

30:08.166 --> 30:09.833
There's something scratched here.

30:10.666 --> 30:12.041
"DQ plus VB"?

30:12.791 --> 30:14.208
Duncan must have been in here.

30:15.333 --> 30:17.250
Where are they? Why haven't we seen Olaf?

30:22.500 --> 30:24.708
- What's going on?
- Count Olaf's just been captured.

30:24.791 --> 30:27.500
- What did he say?
- He said, "Olaf's been captured."

30:27.583 --> 30:29.958
- What did you say?
- She said, "Olaf has been captured."

30:30.041 --> 30:32.333
- What are you doing here?
- I'm running with this crowd.

30:32.416 --> 30:33.500
Come quickly, Baudelaires.

30:33.583 --> 30:35.125
I just heard the news.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.708
Olaf, the notorious villain
I first heard of yesterday,

30:37.791 --> 30:39.333
captured at last in that very saloon.

30:39.416 --> 30:40.666
Do you think it could be true?

30:40.750 --> 30:43.375
I hope so. The Council of Elders
called a special meeting,

30:43.458 --> 30:44.916
which always makes me jumpy.

30:46.250 --> 30:47.458
Settle down, everyone.

30:47.541 --> 30:51.375
We'll answer all your questions,
starting with the visiting banker.

30:54.416 --> 30:55.791
Council of Elders,

30:55.875 --> 30:59.041
I have arrived in town
moments after arriving back in the city

30:59.125 --> 31:01.166
after dropping
the Baudelaires off yesterday.

31:01.250 --> 31:03.458
When I heard Count Olaf had been captured,

31:03.541 --> 31:06.708
I said to myself
it was my civic and financial duty

31:06.791 --> 31:08.708
to come here and see it
with my own two ears.

31:08.791 --> 31:10.291
Can it be the truth?

31:10.375 --> 31:13.958
Is my long nightmare of dealing with
the Baudelaires' long nightmare over?

31:14.041 --> 31:16.875
It is true. Olaf was hiding
in the village in a disguise.

31:16.958 --> 31:21.333
Fortunately, a handsome stranger
who claimed to be an investigative agent

31:21.416 --> 31:23.625
arrived yesterday and captured him.

31:23.708 --> 31:25.750
We've got him handcuffed outside.

31:25.833 --> 31:27.375
Olaf. Not the handsome stranger.

31:27.458 --> 31:31.125
- He certainly is a tall drink of water.
- The handsome stranger, not Olaf.

31:31.208 --> 31:33.958
His female associate
is quite capable, too.

31:34.041 --> 31:35.500
Will you tell him we're grateful?

31:35.583 --> 31:37.958
You can tell him yourself.
He's right back there.

31:41.958 --> 31:47.333
Greetings, all you cool cats.
I am the famous and...

31:49.291 --> 31:52.375
Cool, Detective Dupin.

32:20.625 --> 32:22.083
All right.

32:22.583 --> 32:25.125
I found that utterly convincing.

32:25.708 --> 32:27.125
That's Count Olaf.

32:27.791 --> 32:30.708
I think your prescription is fuzzy,
my little four-eyed kitten.

32:30.791 --> 32:32.916
You orphans are confused.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.375
That is the man who caught Count Olaf.

32:37.208 --> 32:39.791
Officer Luciana, bring in the prisoner.

32:39.875 --> 32:43.833
Yeah, yeah, baby.
Let's get this hootenanny a-hootin'.

32:44.416 --> 32:46.750
- Move it, prisoner.
- I prefer to go by "volunteer."

32:46.833 --> 32:50.666
I prefer to go by
Donatella Violetta Cappuccino Milano.

32:50.750 --> 32:53.000
But you can call me Officer Luciana.

32:54.708 --> 32:57.000
- That's not Olaf.
- No talking on the platform.

32:57.083 --> 32:58.250
We're not on the platform.

32:58.333 --> 33:00.000
Hector, control those orphans.

33:03.458 --> 33:06.916
As a citizen of this village,
we should be able to speak.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.041
That man is not Count Olaf. That man is.

33:09.125 --> 33:12.791
Why should we believe three children
over our chief of police?

33:12.875 --> 33:16.958
- Because none of you have met Count Olaf.
- That's true. I've never met Count Olaf.

33:17.041 --> 33:19.666
I read about him in the newspaper once.
Does that count?

33:19.750 --> 33:22.666
Don't worry. I've been
in worse scrapes than this.

33:23.500 --> 33:24.583
Silence.

33:24.666 --> 33:26.916
The children are right.
None of us have met Olaf.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.416
Maybe I can be of some assistance.

33:29.500 --> 33:33.708
I realize that my speaking on the platform
would be breaking rule 902,

33:33.791 --> 33:36.083
to which I cite rule 732,

33:36.166 --> 33:38.333
in which a visiting banker
is allowed to speak

33:38.416 --> 33:40.458
as long as he is acting
in the role of a consultant.

33:40.541 --> 33:42.750
You are familiar with our rules?

33:42.833 --> 33:47.916
I have been told that I have
a natural aptitude for bureaucracy.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.666
The floor is yours, Mr. Poe.

33:51.708 --> 33:53.833
Ladies and gentlemen,

33:54.541 --> 33:57.041
as head banker
of the Baudelaires' affairs,

33:57.125 --> 34:00.250
I had the opportunity, to meet
Olaf on countless occasions.

34:00.333 --> 34:02.250
At least five or six times.

34:02.333 --> 34:04.000
Olaf has one big eyebrow.

34:04.625 --> 34:06.458
As you can see,
this man also has one eyebrow.

34:06.541 --> 34:07.458
It's glued on.

34:07.541 --> 34:09.958
Why would he glue an eyebrow on?

34:10.041 --> 34:10.875
Good point.

34:10.958 --> 34:13.625
Olaf also has the tattoo
of an eye on his left ankle.

34:13.708 --> 34:15.166
The tattoo. He won't have a tattoo.

34:15.250 --> 34:17.291
Sir, in the name of the law,

34:17.375 --> 34:19.750
would you please expose
your left ankle to the crowd?

34:19.833 --> 34:22.000
Little racy for a family show, but sure.

34:27.125 --> 34:28.583
As you can see,

34:28.666 --> 34:31.958
this man has the single eyebrow
and the ankle tattoo,

34:32.041 --> 34:35.833
and therefore is inarguably Olaf.

34:41.416 --> 34:43.541
Well said, banker man.

34:43.625 --> 34:47.083
Now that Count Olaf
is verifiability verified,

34:47.166 --> 34:50.000
let's start groovin' on how
we're gonna punish this bad cat.

34:50.083 --> 34:51.791
Who's got suggestions?

34:51.875 --> 34:54.291
No nuts on his ice cream sundaes.

34:54.375 --> 34:56.583
Psst. Baudelaires,
my name is Jacques Snicket.

34:56.666 --> 34:59.666
My associate and I trailed
the Quagmires here just like you did.

34:59.750 --> 35:01.791
Though, obviously,
we've suffered some setbacks.

35:02.375 --> 35:05.750
VFD already has a strict system
of punishment in place.

35:05.833 --> 35:09.166
In accordance with rule number two,
which deals with rule-breakers,

35:09.250 --> 35:11.958
Count Olaf is to be marched
into the center of town

35:12.041 --> 35:15.541
and issued a stiff but reasonable fine.

35:15.625 --> 35:17.458
That's the best you birds got?

35:17.541 --> 35:19.916
- How do you know us?
- How did he capture you?

35:20.000 --> 35:20.958
To answer, Violet,

35:21.041 --> 35:23.291
your family and mine
have always been close.

35:23.375 --> 35:28.166
To answer your question, Klaus,
Olaf and I have what you'd call a history.

35:28.250 --> 35:29.916
Why do you have the same tattoo of an eye?

35:30.000 --> 35:32.583
It's not an eye. Look closer.

35:33.333 --> 35:35.041
It's three letters.

35:35.791 --> 35:36.833
"VFD."

35:36.916 --> 35:40.166
House arrest! And he has to wear
one of those scratchy ankle things.

35:40.250 --> 35:43.541
You're getting warmer, fancy pants.
Let's make it hot.

35:43.625 --> 35:46.041
Once I'm free and the Quagmires are safe,
we'll take you...

35:46.125 --> 35:48.291
I say we burn him at the stake.

35:51.666 --> 35:54.083
- Oh, fantastic idea!
- Tremendous!

35:54.166 --> 35:56.666
Ethically iffy but very exciting.

35:56.750 --> 35:59.666
Listen, I may need some help after all.

35:59.750 --> 36:02.500
- Ever break a man out of prison?
- How hard can it be?

36:02.583 --> 36:03.625
That's the spirit.

36:04.166 --> 36:08.125
It's settled. Olaf will be burned
at the stake tomorrow after breakfast.

36:08.208 --> 36:10.375
I recommend steel-cut oatmeal.

36:10.458 --> 36:11.958
Meeting adjourned.

36:17.875 --> 36:19.041
Yeah.

36:19.791 --> 36:21.166
Andiamo, prisoner.

36:23.208 --> 36:24.375
Counting on you, volunteers.

36:27.166 --> 36:30.166
Baudelaires, I believe
this is your responsibility.

36:36.083 --> 36:38.708
Thanks for carrying me home.
Now we can leave.

36:38.791 --> 36:41.875
The Council will burn Olaf at the stake,
and he only broke one rule.

36:41.958 --> 36:44.041
Imagine what they'd do
if they discovered this barn.

36:44.125 --> 36:45.541
We're not leaving, and that's not Olaf.

36:45.625 --> 36:47.875
The real Olaf
is disguised as Detective Dupin.

36:47.958 --> 36:50.583
He's working with your chief of police,
who's really Esmé Squalor,

36:50.666 --> 36:52.625
and they've framed the man
looking for the Quagmires.

36:52.708 --> 36:53.666
You have to believe us.

36:53.750 --> 36:56.833
Of course I believe you.
That's why we have to get of town.

36:56.916 --> 36:58.583
Things are scary and complicated.

36:58.666 --> 37:01.291
The Council of Elders
will burn Jacques Snicket.

37:01.375 --> 37:02.500
Are you going to let that happen?

37:02.583 --> 37:05.333
Nobody likes the idea of an innocent man
being burned alive.

37:05.416 --> 37:06.666
Well, hardly anyone.

37:06.750 --> 37:08.500
But if we don't escape now,
we could be next.

37:08.583 --> 37:10.291
But, Hector, you can't leave.

37:10.375 --> 37:12.541
You said you didn't finish
testing the engine.

37:12.625 --> 37:14.666
What if your engine conductivity is low?

37:14.750 --> 37:17.666
Low engine conductivity
is a leading cause in aircraft failure.

37:18.291 --> 37:19.708
It has been making sputtery noises.

37:19.791 --> 37:22.500
See? You don't want to be in the air
with a faulty engine.

37:22.583 --> 37:24.875
- That wouldn't be safe.
- Or self-sustaining.

37:24.958 --> 37:27.583
Neither would being burned,
but what choice do I have?

37:27.666 --> 37:31.333
- You could let my sister fix it.
- If you to wait until we're ready.

37:31.416 --> 37:33.708
- You'd do that for me?
- If you'd do that for us.

37:33.791 --> 37:36.166
- What if you can't fix it?
- She can always fix it.

37:42.125 --> 37:45.583
Here's your problem.
You need solid 12-gauge wires.

37:46.166 --> 37:47.666
These are stranded 14.

37:47.750 --> 37:50.541
I need wire cutters, banana plugs
and a small oiling can.

37:54.750 --> 37:55.708
Will this work?

38:09.791 --> 38:11.666
I need your biggest wrench.

38:23.041 --> 38:26.750
Now we need to help Jacques. I need
full access to your inventing materials.

38:26.833 --> 38:28.500
I need blueprints of the uptown jail.

38:28.583 --> 38:32.375
Full access to my inventing materials
and the blueprints of the uptown jail?

38:32.458 --> 38:34.541
What are you planning, a jailbreak?

38:36.250 --> 38:39.625
Oh, no. No, no, no. No.

38:43.416 --> 38:45.625
I'd offer you tea,
but they're sweet and fruity.

38:45.708 --> 38:49.083
Sweet and fruity doesn't count as tea,
and your scheme is equally dismissible.

38:49.166 --> 38:51.250
Strong words for someone in a deluxe cell.

38:51.333 --> 38:53.250
What happened to
handing me over to the police

38:53.333 --> 38:55.125
and sending me to jail for a long time?

38:55.208 --> 38:57.416
It never occurred to me
that your girlfriend would be

38:57.500 --> 39:01.500
- as treacherous and violent as you.
- You've never approved of my love life.

39:02.291 --> 39:04.708
I want what's best
for those I respect and admire.

39:04.791 --> 39:06.500
That includes you, Olaf.

39:06.583 --> 39:08.583
You've got a keen mind
and a flair for the dramatic.

39:08.666 --> 39:11.416
When that saloon across town
was a firehouse,

39:11.500 --> 39:13.583
you and I put some noble deeds
on the books.

39:14.458 --> 39:16.208
I'm tired of books, Snicket.

39:16.291 --> 39:19.791
The world is dark and horrible.
You know what makes it brighter?

39:19.875 --> 39:20.791
Sapphires.

39:20.875 --> 39:23.458
- You're better than that.
- You sound like Beatrice.

39:23.541 --> 39:26.500
She was right. If you reinvestigate
your ethical priorities,

39:26.583 --> 39:29.583
you could help repair the world
instead of filling it with smoke.

39:29.666 --> 39:34.708
Olaf, let's do some good work together.
What do you say?

39:38.125 --> 39:39.250
What do I say?

39:49.291 --> 39:52.458
Orphans. Nothing but trouble. Am I right?

39:52.541 --> 39:53.666
No, you're not.

39:53.750 --> 39:56.333
What did these droopy, desperate orphans
ever do for you?

39:56.416 --> 39:57.500
Before you got mixed up with them,

39:57.583 --> 40:01.791
I'll bet you had some kind of a life,
a future. Now look at you.

40:03.625 --> 40:05.750
- Is that a corset?
- Yes.

40:05.833 --> 40:09.000
Look at me, a part of a noble
and heroic organization,

40:09.083 --> 40:11.000
finally putting
my innate physical dexterity

40:11.083 --> 40:12.708
and extensive training in library science

40:12.791 --> 40:14.500
to the purpose
for which they were made.

40:15.375 --> 40:18.958
Do all you bookish volunteers
spout nonsense when you're afraid?

40:19.041 --> 40:20.458
- I'm not afraid.
- You should be.

40:20.541 --> 40:22.458
You think your boyfriend's
going to rescue you?

40:22.541 --> 40:25.125
I think
I'm going to rescue him.

40:26.458 --> 40:29.833
Please. Your boyfriend's
going to burn in the morning.

40:29.916 --> 40:31.833
I'm so sorry if I didn't make that clear.

40:31.916 --> 40:34.125
Not if you unlock this cell and let us go.

40:34.208 --> 40:36.875
- And why would I do that?
- Because I'm a librarian.

40:36.958 --> 40:38.916
Oh.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.750
Don't you see?
Librarians know where to find things.

40:44.708 --> 40:48.375
- What kind of things?
- Missing things.

40:48.458 --> 40:50.666
- Stolen things?
- That's right, Esmé.

40:51.666 --> 40:53.625
If you let Jacques and me go,

40:53.708 --> 40:56.875
I will give you the location
of the sugar bowl.

40:59.041 --> 41:03.541
I thought having prisoners would be fun.
But it's like having a pet or an in-law.

41:03.625 --> 41:05.750
You can lock them up,
then you have to feed them.

41:05.833 --> 41:09.166
Darling. Forget the Snickets
and the Baudelaires.

41:09.250 --> 41:10.500
You've been working so hard.

41:10.583 --> 41:15.375
Let's stay up here for a spell.
I feel like dancing.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.750
- You didn't feel like dancing last night.
- I had a headache.

41:18.833 --> 41:20.875
Now, what are you in the mood for?

41:20.958 --> 41:25.791
The waltz? The watusi?
The horizontal tango?

41:25.875 --> 41:31.125
Well, I have been
working on my line dancing...

41:32.625 --> 41:35.875
Line dancing? Line dancing.

41:36.250 --> 41:37.125
Oh.

41:37.708 --> 41:38.916
Show me more.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.041
- All right. This hand goes here.
- Hmm.

41:41.125 --> 41:42.541
This hand goes here.

41:46.041 --> 41:47.666
Where are the keys to the cells?

41:57.541 --> 41:59.291
What have you done?

41:59.375 --> 42:01.500
Sorry, it was the only thing
I could think of.

42:01.583 --> 42:02.541
You did the right thing.

42:02.625 --> 42:04.416
Get to that sugar bowl
before they do.

42:04.500 --> 42:06.250
You need to find our top field agent.

42:06.333 --> 42:09.416
She knows where it's hidden,
and what to do with it. She knows all.

42:10.166 --> 42:12.875
She's more legitimate than she looks.
Take my taxi.

42:12.958 --> 42:15.250
- What about you?
- Someone needs to protect the children.

42:15.333 --> 42:17.875
Take care of the sugar bowl.
We'll rendezvous as soon as we can.

42:17.958 --> 42:20.208
- Promise me you'll rescue the children.
- I promise.

42:20.291 --> 42:22.666
- Promise me you'll take care of yourself.
- Of course.

42:24.166 --> 42:25.750
Promise me we'll see each other again.

42:31.625 --> 42:32.833
This story isn't over yet.

42:47.708 --> 42:52.208
Actually, this story ends tonight.

42:52.833 --> 42:54.000
We'll see about that.

43:00.375 --> 43:02.208
Haven't we done this too many times?

43:03.083 --> 43:05.958
A hero, a villain, a dusty saloon...

43:06.041 --> 43:08.833
There's always a few new twists.

43:12.333 --> 43:15.916
Aren't you tired of the schemes?
The disguises?

43:16.000 --> 43:18.625
The same routine again and again?

43:18.708 --> 43:21.625
It could end tonight
if you come with me quietly.

43:22.333 --> 43:25.250
It's more fun to be loud.

43:29.666 --> 43:31.666
- Bull's-eye.
- No, it's a boar tusk.

43:31.750 --> 43:33.041
And don't try to flatter me.

43:33.125 --> 43:36.166
I've had it with you
and your organization.

43:36.250 --> 43:37.750
You didn't always feel that way.

43:38.333 --> 43:40.666
You were one of us. You could be again.

43:41.708 --> 43:44.291
I know what happened
that night at the opera, and I'm sorry.

43:46.416 --> 43:48.583
- Are you now?
- I am now.

43:50.208 --> 43:54.333
Turn yourself in. I promise we won't
throw the book at you, old friend.

43:55.541 --> 43:57.541
I can't promise the same.

43:57.625 --> 43:58.750
Meaning?

44:01.708 --> 44:04.458
I said, I can't promise...

44:07.583 --> 44:08.708
the same.

44:11.458 --> 44:14.583
Those old people were right.
Books are dangerous.

44:14.666 --> 44:16.083
The heavy ones at least.

44:18.000 --> 44:22.500
Oh, lookee here. A crowbar in a crow bar.

44:25.625 --> 44:29.375
It was me or you, old friend.

44:39.833 --> 44:42.958
There is a word to describe
a large number of crows.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.541
It is not a pleasant word.

44:46.625 --> 44:49.000
It is full of sorrow and sadness.

44:58.541 --> 45:00.958
A large number of crows
is called a murder.

45:03.666 --> 45:06.625
It is a word that will
forever make me think of that morning

45:06.708 --> 45:08.833
in the Village of Fowl Devotees.

45:11.416 --> 45:15.500
A morning so sad, I wish I could strike it
from the Snicket calendar forever.

45:16.583 --> 45:19.916
According to the blueprints, the weakest
spot of the wall should be here.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
Good luck.

45:37.750 --> 45:40.291
- Count Olaf's been murdered!
- What did you say?

45:40.375 --> 45:42.458
He said, "Count Olaf's been murdered!"

45:42.541 --> 45:44.625
What did they say?

45:45.125 --> 45:46.833
They said,

45:46.916 --> 45:52.458
"Count Olaf has been murdered."
