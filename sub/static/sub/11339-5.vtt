Previously on
"Criminal Minds"...

00:03.378 --> 00:04.713
I lost my father...

00:05.964 --> 00:07.925
When I was 9 years old.

00:08.007 --> 00:09.051
He was shot and killed
right in front of me.

00:09.384 --> 00:10.677
Is that your daughter?
Where is she?

00:10.761 --> 00:11.678
She's with my sister.

00:11.762 --> 00:13.138
This is about you.
There's no history

00:13.222 --> 00:15.307
at your sister's place.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.478
Promise me
she'll be ok, Morgan.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.688
Do it and promise him!

00:22.731 --> 00:25.150
Ok.
Promise me, Morgan.

00:25.192 --> 00:26.527
Ok!

00:28.403 --> 00:29.821
I promise.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.198
I love you, Ellie.

You never fought a man

01:59.786 --> 02:02.873

you twisted psycho.

No! Please! Stop it!

02:07.753 --> 02:08.794
Please!

02:10.005 --> 02:12.341
Last night, all 4 members
of the Bennett family

02:12.424 --> 02:14.843
were killed in their home
in Council Bluffs, Iowa.

02:14.927 --> 02:17.513
Jake and Sandra Bennett
were the parents

02:17.554 --> 02:21.558
of Sammy, 11, and Kayla, 9.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.061
Agent Beeks in the Omaha
field office called me.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.854
The previous night,
the other family, the Archers,

02:25.938 --> 02:27.981
were killed just across
the state line in Nebraska.

02:28.065 --> 02:29.441
He thinks
it's the same offender.

02:29.525 --> 02:31.026
The M.O. is consistent.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.320
Both mothers died due to
severe blunt-force trauma,

02:33.362 --> 02:34.988
and the fathers suffered
multiple stab wounds.

02:35.072 --> 02:37.324
The children
were all strangled.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.326
Violence only
in the kids' rooms,

02:39.368 --> 02:41.578
but no sexual abuse
on any of the children.

02:41.662 --> 02:42.955
That's odd.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.957
Odd comes up right now,

02:44.998 --> 02:47.668
because the Bennett father
was not just stabbed,

02:47.751 --> 02:49.670
he was also...

02:49.711 --> 02:51.171
And those pictures
are in your personal files

02:51.213 --> 02:53.382
because I didn't think
they needed the help of 1080p.

02:53.465 --> 02:58.011
His chest was opened,
organs disturbed, intestines removed.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.013
That's awesome.
Could we please leave the gross part

03:00.055 --> 03:01.014
of the conversation
for the plane?

03:01.056 --> 03:02.641
The father of the Archer family

03:02.683 --> 03:04.977
had multiple stab wounds
but no dissection.

03:05.018 --> 03:08.730
So he went from piquerism
to this overnight?

03:08.814 --> 03:11.191
2 families in 2 days.
He's on a spree.

03:11.233 --> 03:12.776
Wheels up in 30.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.451
Hey, Morgan.

03:31.587 --> 03:34.256
Ellie, how did you get past
airport security?

03:34.339 --> 03:37.342
I stayed real close
to this family.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.844
Nobody asked.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.638
If they had, I would have
said I was 12,

03:41.722 --> 03:43.307
'cause you can fly by yourself.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.684
This is not all right.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.895
You can't just run away
like this.

03:47.936 --> 03:51.523
But that house is awful.

03:51.565 --> 03:55.402
This older boy tries
to watch me in the shower.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.576
Hey. It's way early in L.A.

04:02.618 --> 04:04.453
I left a message
with Child Protective Services,

04:04.536 --> 04:05.621
but I haven't heard...

04:05.704 --> 04:07.623
you can't send me back there.

04:07.664 --> 04:11.251
Ellie, you're a missing kid.

04:11.293 --> 04:14.129
We have to let them
know you're safe.

04:14.213 --> 04:16.839
I didn't know where else to go.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.468
I know.

04:21.053 --> 04:23.972
Listen, this is one of
my very good friends, Penelope.

04:24.056 --> 04:25.807
She's going to look
after you while I'm gone.

04:25.891 --> 04:28.310
Hi, honey.

04:28.393 --> 04:31.563
Ellie, I'll come back
as soon as I can.

04:36.568 --> 04:37.778
Come on, Ellie.

04:40.072 --> 04:40.989
Go ahead.

04:41.073 --> 04:43.659
It's ok.

04:45.327 --> 04:46.537
Come on, Ellie.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.748
Have you ever been
in a lair before?

04:49.790 --> 04:51.208
You'll like it.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.256
What are you gonna do?

04:57.297 --> 04:59.550
I don't know.

Hotch, listen.

05:48.557 --> 05:51.768
Garcia's gonna help me find
a way to get Ellie back to L.A.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.103
How did she get here?

05:53.145 --> 05:55.439
She stole her foster mom's
credit card,

05:55.480 --> 05:56.857
then bought a ticket online,

05:56.940 --> 05:59.109
and then somehow lied her way
through airport security.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.444
How old is she?

06:00.527 --> 06:01.737
She's 9.

06:01.778 --> 06:04.448
I didn't see this coming at all,
but I will fix it.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.575
Check this out.

06:06.617 --> 06:09.912
No forced entry
at either house.

06:09.953 --> 06:13.540
Both dinner tables are set
for 5 people, not 4.

06:13.624 --> 06:15.334
Maybe they knew him
and invited him to dinner.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.002
Both families
live in different States

06:17.085 --> 06:18.337
but only 8 miles apart.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.963
Is it possible
they knew each other?

06:20.005 --> 06:22.508
Garcia, did you find
any overlap between

06:22.591 --> 06:23.675
the Bennett
and Archer families?

06:23.759 --> 06:25.636
Zip. They didn't work, shop,
eat, or worship

06:25.719 --> 06:27.137
in any of the same places.

06:27.179 --> 06:29.264
Worship?
Both families religious?

06:29.306 --> 06:30.849
And then some. Pretty much
all their social lives

06:30.933 --> 06:32.809
revolved around some kind
of church activities.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.311
Maybe he forced the families

06:34.353 --> 06:36.021
to make dinner
as part of a ritual,

06:36.104 --> 06:37.147
like Karl Arnold.

06:37.189 --> 06:39.483
The fox was a classic
family annihilator

06:39.525 --> 06:40.817
who targeted patriarchs.

06:40.859 --> 06:42.861
The dissection of the last dad
makes me think the unsub

06:42.945 --> 06:44.780
was focused on male parents
as well.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.198
I'm not so sure.

06:46.281 --> 06:48.158
There's a lot of overkill
on the mothers.

06:48.242 --> 06:49.326
All right, when we land,

06:49.409 --> 06:50.869
Morgan, Prentiss, and I
will go get set up

06:50.953 --> 06:52.371
at the field office
with Agent Beeks.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.164
Dave, you and Reid
drive to Council Bluffs

06:54.248 --> 06:56.166
while the crime scene's
still fresh.

07:04.758 --> 07:07.845
Family annihilators tend
to kill the children first.

07:07.886 --> 07:11.348
It makes the parents
suffer the most.

07:11.431 --> 07:16.186
Maybe that wasn't
the only reason.

07:16.228 --> 07:19.857
Mom comes up to say
that dinner is ready.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.025
First thing she sees
the children.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.652
She runs to them.

07:23.694 --> 07:27.531
She opens up her back
to attack.

07:27.573 --> 07:29.408
He uses the children as bait.

07:29.491 --> 07:31.159
The father arrives next.

07:31.201 --> 07:34.496
He runs to the family
just as the mother did.

07:34.538 --> 07:36.707
The unsub repeats the attack.

07:36.748 --> 07:39.668
Aah! No!

07:39.751 --> 07:41.211
It worked the first time.

07:41.295 --> 07:43.547
It's a risky plan.
The unsub needs 10 0r 15 minutes

07:43.630 --> 07:45.382
alone with the children
to tie them up.

07:46.592 --> 07:49.052
The table's set for 5.

07:49.094 --> 07:51.722
They were going to have tacos.

07:51.763 --> 07:54.183
The big pot has red meat,

07:54.224 --> 07:56.351
the small one has...

07:56.393 --> 07:58.395
Some sort of tofu mix.

07:58.437 --> 08:01.565
Now, if a psychopath
was forcing you to cook dinner,

08:01.648 --> 08:04.484
would you take the time
to make vegetarian sides?

08:04.568 --> 08:07.154
He obviously didn't force
Sandra to make dinner.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.530
She wasn't afraid of him.

08:08.572 --> 08:10.240
He was their guest.

08:10.282 --> 08:12.367
He's too disorganized
to bring a gun.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.161
All the other items
he used on the families

08:14.244 --> 08:15.829
came from within the house.

08:15.871 --> 08:19.124
Kitchen knives, jump ropes,
belts.

08:19.208 --> 08:20.751
The Bennetts trusted him
with their kids.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.794
They had to have known
this guy.

08:26.882 --> 08:29.676
M.E. report on Jake Bennett
says he died less than a minute

08:29.760 --> 08:31.595
after being stabbed
multiple times.

08:31.678 --> 08:34.181
All dissection was done
postmortem.

08:34.264 --> 08:35.515
If it was done postmortem,

08:35.599 --> 08:37.934
it was probably done out of
curiosity and not torture.

08:37.976 --> 08:39.895
Is there any indication
of medical training?

08:39.937 --> 08:41.855
Apparently
it's just the opposite.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.106
The cuts were crude.

08:43.190 --> 08:46.693
No more advanced
than dissecting a frog.

08:46.777 --> 08:49.696
Sandra Bennett died slowly,
in a lot of pain,

08:49.780 --> 08:51.198
just like Monica Archer.

08:51.281 --> 08:52.866
The wives suffer the most,

08:52.950 --> 08:54.993
physically and psychologically.

08:55.077 --> 08:57.371
So what does that get us?
This guy hates his mother?

08:57.454 --> 08:59.122
It means that
everything he did,

08:59.206 --> 09:00.958
he did to hurt Sandra
and Monica.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.835
He's targeting women.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.093
Hey. How's she doing?

09:11.134 --> 09:12.803
Sleeping.

09:12.845 --> 09:16.306
Which, I get the impression,
she has not done in many weeks.

09:16.390 --> 09:19.101
There are 6 kids living
in that foster house.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.727
Well, what did the family say?

09:20.811 --> 09:24.064
They didn't know
she was missing.

09:24.106 --> 09:26.108
Sandra was a sixth-grade
teacher,

09:26.149 --> 09:27.985
she ran a church program
for adult literacy,

09:28.068 --> 09:30.279
and volunteered
at a local soup kitchen.

09:30.320 --> 09:33.323
Monica Archer was a nurse
at Northern Omaha Medical,

09:33.407 --> 09:36.660
and she worked pro Bono with
disabled veterans at the V.A.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.745
Maybe he posed as a victim,
asked for their help.

09:38.829 --> 09:41.123
It's likely these women
would help a stranger

09:41.206 --> 09:42.499
but doubtful that
they'd let him upstairs.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.001
It could be another volunteer.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.003
If they met him
doing charity work,

09:46.086 --> 09:48.338
he could seem trustworthy.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.174
Ok, so, we'll look into
volunteers who worked

09:50.257 --> 09:52.342
with both Monica Archer
and Sandra Bennett,

09:52.426 --> 09:53.969
but even so,

09:54.011 --> 09:56.346
neither of these women
would have left their children

09:56.430 --> 09:57.723
with someone
they didn't know well.

09:57.806 --> 09:59.141
It's unlikely
that it's a stranger,

09:59.183 --> 10:00.475
but we haven't found
a single person

10:00.517 --> 10:02.519
that knew both families.

10:02.561 --> 10:06.064
Great. So we have
a disorganized killer

10:06.148 --> 10:09.484
on a spree
who appears perfectly stable.

10:09.568 --> 10:10.819
People trust him on sight.

10:10.861 --> 10:11.987
And he has absolute confidence

10:12.029 --> 10:13.864
that no one will guess
what he is.

10:43.227 --> 10:44.394
I'm Jeremy.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.396
Do you need a lift?

10:46.480 --> 10:48.065
My mom says I shouldn't
get into a car

10:48.148 --> 10:49.816
with someone I don't know.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.944
She'd, like, kill me.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.237
Your mom's right.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.073
But there's a gas station
a mile or so up the road.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.366
I could take you there.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.369
Well, that sounds all right.

11:00.410 --> 11:03.247
Cool. Um, thanks.

11:03.330 --> 11:06.667
It's getting cold out.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.710
I love this song.

11:08.752 --> 11:11.421
Me, too.

11:11.505 --> 11:13.298
Put your seatbelt on.

11:13.382 --> 11:16.885
♪ You got designer shades
just to hide your face ♪

11:16.927 --> 11:20.389
♪ and you wear them around
like you're cooler than me ♪

11:20.430 --> 11:24.101
♪ you never say,
hey, remember my name ♪

11:24.142 --> 11:27.771
♪ and it's probably 'cause you
think you're cooler than me ♪

11:51.211 --> 11:54.173
He dissected the victim's arm postmortem.
I think it's our guy.

11:54.423 --> 11:56.216
- Just one victim?
- Yeah.

11:57.551 --> 12:00.345
He's in the passenger seat.

12:02.973 --> 12:04.433
Who is he?

12:06.018 --> 12:07.269
Louis Hannum.

12:07.352 --> 12:09.104
41 years old,
well-known local Reverend.

12:09.188 --> 12:12.107
He closed the church after
a canned food drive at 6 P.M.,

12:12.191 --> 12:15.110
told the other volunteers he was taking
the donations to the Salvation Army

12:15.444 --> 12:17.237
3 miles northeast on Route 6.

12:17.279 --> 12:18.322
Did he leave with anyone?

12:18.405 --> 12:19.907
No, they said he left alone.

12:19.948 --> 12:21.491
We're still getting names
of everyone who was there.

12:21.575 --> 12:24.036
Before now, he's attacked
families in their homes.

12:24.119 --> 12:25.913
Now just one victim
on the side of the road?

12:25.996 --> 12:28.957
It doesn't... it doesn't
really fit his victimology.

12:29.041 --> 12:30.959
Well, it looks like
he stabbed the Reverend

12:31.043 --> 12:33.629
while he was driving and then
the truck crashed down here,

12:33.670 --> 12:35.756
he pushed him over,
tried to drive away,

12:35.839 --> 12:37.007
but the truck was stuck.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.384
His rage was so blinding,
he takes out the driver

12:39.426 --> 12:40.719
while in motion.

12:40.802 --> 12:43.180
He's lucky he didn't crash
into oncoming traffic.

12:43.263 --> 12:46.892
Then he immediately calms down
and dissects the victim's arm?

12:46.975 --> 12:49.186
Yeah, he's incapable of
thinking 5 minutes ahead.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.812
It's like he's got a.D.D.

12:50.896 --> 12:53.732
A short attention span
is putting it mildly.

12:53.815 --> 12:57.736
He's got wild mood swings,
he's impulsive.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.489
Young adults are inherently
nonthreatening.

13:00.572 --> 13:03.325
Parents would allow him to
be alone with their children

13:03.408 --> 13:04.785
because he's the same age.

13:04.868 --> 13:06.286
If he's prepubescent,
it would also explain

13:06.370 --> 13:08.956
why there's no sexual
experimentation on the victims.

13:09.039 --> 13:10.123
You guys can't be serious.

13:10.207 --> 13:11.333
Think about it.

13:11.416 --> 13:14.795
He opens up human bodies
out of curiosity,

13:14.837 --> 13:18.590
the same way I used to open up
radios and tv sets when I was 13.

13:22.803 --> 13:24.137
I don't like it here.

13:24.221 --> 13:25.848
Amber, you told me you
needed to use the bathroom

13:25.931 --> 13:28.308
asap 5 times until I stopped.

13:28.350 --> 13:29.810
This is a bathroom.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.311
I didn't mean a gross bathroom.

13:31.395 --> 13:34.815
Don't touch anything.
You can get herpes or worse.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.567
Zack, enough.

13:36.650 --> 13:37.985
Mom...

13:38.068 --> 13:40.195
If I get herpes,
it's your fault.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.907
Oh, come on.

13:50.622 --> 13:52.207
Hey there.

13:53.250 --> 13:54.501
Are you all right?

13:54.543 --> 13:56.378
This kid is streetwise,

13:56.461 --> 13:59.006
but clearly comfortable and easily
accepted in a middle-class suburban home.

13:59.047 --> 14:02.342
We can't diagnose anyone under
the age of 18 as antisocial,

14:02.426 --> 14:05.888
so we are labeling this unsub
a budding psychopath.

14:05.971 --> 14:10.475
I came out of the bathroom
and the bus was gone.

14:10.559 --> 14:11.852
The bus stopped out here?

14:11.894 --> 14:13.854
Well, yeah.
This woman was sick

14:13.896 --> 14:16.064
and she said
she needed some air.

14:16.148 --> 14:17.524
Where's your mom, hon?

14:17.608 --> 14:18.984
Well, we live in Omaha,

14:19.067 --> 14:21.320
but my mom's visiting
my aunt in Chicago.

14:21.403 --> 14:23.739
His interpersonal skills
are through the roof.

14:23.822 --> 14:26.200
Now, this manipulation
is not just a ruse.

14:26.241 --> 14:27.910
It is a complex con.

14:27.993 --> 14:30.495
I knew I shouldn't
have gotten off.

14:30.579 --> 14:33.081
Well, maybe I should just call your mom for you.
Does she have a cell phone?

14:33.165 --> 14:37.252
Yeah! Um, it's...

14:37.336 --> 14:39.546
My phone's on the bus.

14:39.630 --> 14:42.216
I was supposed to memorize
the numbers, but I never did.

14:42.299 --> 14:45.385
If I don't get off the bus
in Chicago tomorrow morning,

14:45.469 --> 14:46.845
my mom will freak out.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.430
Look for reports
of missing children

14:48.514 --> 14:50.015
in and around
the city of Omaha.

14:50.098 --> 14:52.226
This is where his killing
spree originated.

14:52.309 --> 14:54.019
And check juvenile detention
centers and psychiatric programs

14:54.102 --> 14:56.647
for boys who've been recently
released or escaped.

14:56.730 --> 14:59.107
We believe he's crossed
the state line into Iowa.

14:59.191 --> 15:01.777
His last victim was traveling
northeast on Route 6.

15:01.860 --> 15:04.488
How has a kid gotten 40-some
miles all by himself?

15:04.571 --> 15:07.115
They all give him rides
and places to stay.

15:07.199 --> 15:09.743
Well, you can't stay
out here all alone.

15:09.785 --> 15:12.996
We'll go to the police.
They can find your mom a lot faster than we can.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.498
Really?

15:14.581 --> 15:16.458
- Yeah, come on.-
- Thank you so much.

15:16.542 --> 15:17.876
Thank you.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.504
He appears
extremely vulnerable.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.173
Being a child alone
out on the road,

15:23.257 --> 15:24.842
that's not hard to do.

15:28.387 --> 15:30.222
Come on!

15:36.979 --> 15:38.522
Uhh! Come on!

15:38.605 --> 15:40.107
You're letting him go to jail.

15:40.148 --> 15:41.984
No, honey,
this is a police station.

15:42.067 --> 15:43.443
They'll help him find his mom.

15:43.527 --> 15:46.321
Uhh! Come on!

15:46.405 --> 15:47.614
Do you mind
if we wait here a minute,

15:47.698 --> 15:50.117
until those guys have gone in?

15:50.158 --> 15:51.994
You're gonna need
a weapon or something,

15:52.077 --> 15:53.829
in case that guy
tries to shiv you.

15:53.871 --> 15:54.955
Zack.

15:54.997 --> 15:57.624
Come on!
Uhh!

15:57.708 --> 16:00.252
Will I have to sleep
in the same prison cell as him?

16:00.335 --> 16:01.962
Absolutely not.
You're not sleeping in a cell.

16:02.004 --> 16:03.964
What if they don't find
his mom tonight?

16:04.006 --> 16:06.925
If I take a bus to Uncle
David's and get lost,

16:07.009 --> 16:08.927
would I have to
sleep in jail, too?

16:09.011 --> 16:10.679
No, Amber, of course not.

16:10.762 --> 16:13.765
Get your hands off me!

16:16.768 --> 16:18.187
Jeremy won't be sleeping
here, either.

16:18.270 --> 16:19.938
You're staying with us tonight.

16:20.022 --> 16:21.273
Thank you so much.

16:21.356 --> 16:22.816
We'll bring you back
in the morning.

16:22.858 --> 16:23.984
Thanks.

16:27.362 --> 16:30.824
No, I know, as soon as Ellie crossed
state lines, it became a federal case.

16:30.908 --> 16:32.492
Mm-Hmm. Which is why
it's ok

16:32.534 --> 16:34.661
that she remain
in federal custody.

16:34.745 --> 16:37.539
What are the chances of getting
her transferred to Virginia?

16:37.623 --> 16:39.833
Oh, they are quite good.

16:39.917 --> 16:43.170
Because the Federal Child Abuse
Prevention and Treatment Act

16:43.253 --> 16:44.838
defines this as neglect.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.341
It's in her best interest
that she be removed immediately.

16:47.424 --> 16:49.676
Well, that's good.
That's great.

16:49.718 --> 16:50.844
Baby girl, thank you.

16:50.928 --> 16:52.137
Do me a favor.

16:52.221 --> 16:54.348
Tell her to keep
her head up, all right?

16:54.389 --> 16:55.682
I will, honey.

16:55.724 --> 16:58.602
What's going on?

17:00.479 --> 17:03.899
The foster family didn't even know
Ellie was missing.

17:03.982 --> 17:05.608
I'm doing what I can
to get her transferred

17:05.692 --> 17:07.569
to Child Protective
Services in Virginia.

17:07.653 --> 17:09.863
You think that's a good idea?

17:09.946 --> 17:12.907
I just want to know
that that girl is safe.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.285
If you asked me
to look after Jack,

17:15.368 --> 17:17.119
would you be happy right now?

17:17.204 --> 17:20.415
I know that you'd do
everything you could.

17:25.420 --> 17:28.173
He's been in the system?
I thought you said he's from suburbia.

17:28.257 --> 17:30.092
He grew up in medium
socio-economic status,

17:30.175 --> 17:32.886
but his rage against families
tells us that he experienced

17:32.970 --> 17:34.346
extreme abuse or neglect,

17:34.429 --> 17:35.889
so at some point,
he was most likely

17:35.931 --> 17:37.224
removed from his family.

17:37.266 --> 17:39.059
Now, I had Garcia widen the
search of missing children

17:39.101 --> 17:41.645
to those in foster homes and
juvenile care facilities,

17:41.728 --> 17:44.565
all represented by
these 10 black dots.

17:44.648 --> 17:46.900
10 kids fit our profile.
That's great.

17:46.984 --> 17:50.571
Actually, each dot represents a
thousand currently in the system.

17:50.612 --> 17:52.322
10,000 children?

17:52.406 --> 17:54.324
Nebraska's one of the nation's
highest per capita

17:54.408 --> 17:55.909
state ward populations.

17:55.993 --> 17:57.911
Now, using the age
and the gender of our suspect,

17:57.953 --> 17:59.121
I was able
to whittle down the search,

17:59.204 --> 18:01.540
and that yielded
this interesting pattern.

18:01.623 --> 18:03.083
A pattern of red dots.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.459
Give me one more hint.

18:04.543 --> 18:05.794
The red dots represent

18:05.878 --> 18:07.629
33 boys between the age
of 10 and 17

18:07.713 --> 18:09.256
who became wards
of the state this year,

18:09.339 --> 18:11.258
all abandoned
at major hospitals.

18:11.300 --> 18:13.510
The state safe haven law.

18:13.594 --> 18:15.929
Wait a minute.
I thought the safe haven law

18:15.971 --> 18:18.807
was so that women could leave
unwanted babies in hospitals

18:18.891 --> 18:20.475
instead of leaving them
in dumpsters.

18:20.559 --> 18:23.145
That's correct, but initially there
was no age limit in Nebraska.

18:23.228 --> 18:25.439
He's right. The law
now just covers infants,

18:25.522 --> 18:27.608
but we still get
teenagers left at hospitals

18:27.691 --> 18:29.109
with a note
pinned to their jacket.

18:29.193 --> 18:31.028
Some are even driven in
from out of state.

18:31.111 --> 18:33.197
Now, Monica Archer,
our first victim,

18:33.280 --> 18:35.949
worked at this hospital,
Northern Omaha Medical.

18:36.033 --> 18:37.784
If the unsub's parents
abandoned him there,

18:37.868 --> 18:39.328
it's probably where they met.

18:46.084 --> 18:48.337
Oh, bummer.
Hey, did you get "God of war"?

18:48.420 --> 18:50.506
No, but I heard.

18:50.589 --> 18:51.882
I heard it's awesome.

18:51.965 --> 18:54.468
Jeremy, will you dial
your home number?

18:54.510 --> 18:57.554
I'm just gonna leave a message
saying that you're staying here.

18:57.638 --> 18:59.932
Yeah, sure, but like I said,

19:00.015 --> 19:02.142
I don't think she'll check
the home messages.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.560
Oh, just in case.

19:03.644 --> 19:06.271
Mom, Jeremy says he knows
a really cool game.

19:06.355 --> 19:08.649
Can we go play it in
Zack's room before dinner?

19:08.732 --> 19:10.776
Not now. It's time to eat.

19:10.859 --> 19:13.987
Can we have sodas
since he have a guest?

19:14.029 --> 19:18.158
No. A guest
does not mean soda.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.284
Here you go.

19:19.368 --> 19:21.828
You just have to hit send.

19:21.912 --> 19:24.540
Amber, Zack, this is why
you have to memorize

19:24.623 --> 19:27.751
my cell phone
and Uncle David's, ok?

19:32.172 --> 19:33.632
Hi, this is the Archers'.

19:33.715 --> 19:35.968
We're not home right now.
Please leave us a message

19:36.051 --> 19:37.302
and we'll call you right back.

19:38.387 --> 19:41.181
Hi. Hello. My name
is Nancy Riverton,

19:41.265 --> 19:43.559
and, uh, your son Jeremy

19:43.642 --> 19:47.187
missed his bus at
the rest stop on Route 6.

19:47.229 --> 19:50.357
He's fine. He's safe.
Don't worry. He's with me.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.818
But if you could just give me a
call as soon as you get this.

19:52.901 --> 19:57.030
I'm at 515-555-0154.

19:57.114 --> 19:59.199
Ok. Thanks.

20:05.581 --> 20:07.791
Ohh!
Oh-ho!

20:13.589 --> 20:16.008
So what happens here
when a child is abandoned?

20:16.091 --> 20:18.051
The hospital contacts
social services.

20:18.093 --> 20:20.721
The act of abandonment immediately
labels the parents unfit

20:20.804 --> 20:22.431
and the child becomes
a ward of the state.

20:22.472 --> 20:24.391
So he goes into foster care.

20:24.433 --> 20:27.144
Ideally, but most parents
won't take older children.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.021
In which case, he'd be sent
to a juvenile facility.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.023
The same one
that houses delinquents?

20:31.106 --> 20:32.232
That's right.

20:32.274 --> 20:33.984
Did Northern Omaha Medical
register an adolescent boy

20:34.067 --> 20:35.861
as a ward of the state
on that day?

20:35.944 --> 20:37.738
Garcia said no,
but she's still looking.

20:37.779 --> 20:39.907
If Monica wanted to keep
him out of a facility,

20:39.990 --> 20:42.201
she might have gone
around protocol.

20:42.242 --> 20:43.911
But she might still
have documented it.

20:43.952 --> 20:45.370
Reid and Rossi,
go to the Archer house

20:45.454 --> 20:47.748
and see if you can figure out
what her plan was.

20:48.790 --> 20:50.876
Ok.

20:50.959 --> 20:52.085
There you go, sweetheart.

20:52.127 --> 20:54.046
You get some sleep,
and we'll get in touch

20:54.129 --> 20:55.547
with your mom
in the morning, ok?

20:55.631 --> 20:57.090
It's all gonna be all right.

20:57.132 --> 20:58.759
Thanks.

21:03.013 --> 21:05.557
Uh, don't turn that light off.

21:05.641 --> 21:07.768
I'm not scared.
It's just...

21:07.851 --> 21:09.561
Of course.
I understand.

21:09.645 --> 21:12.231
You come get me if you
need anything, ok?

21:33.001 --> 21:34.169
I don't know what you'll find.

21:34.461 --> 21:35.587
This was the first crime scene,

21:35.671 --> 21:38.090
so believe me, my guys went over it
with a fine-tooth comb.

21:38.173 --> 21:39.925
I'm sure they did, but now
we know that Mrs. Archer

21:40.008 --> 21:41.593
chose to take the suspect home

21:41.677 --> 21:43.804
instead of taking him so social
services like she should have,

21:43.887 --> 21:45.639
we need to try
to figure out why.

21:45.722 --> 21:47.266
She was a nurse for 15 years.

21:47.349 --> 21:49.059
She would know how
to work the system.

21:49.142 --> 21:51.228
Maybe she called in favors
with social workers

21:51.270 --> 21:54.064
or knew some foster parents
that could take him in.

21:54.147 --> 21:55.315
They've got messages.

21:55.399 --> 21:57.234
My guys checked it the first day.
Those must be new.

21:58.944 --> 22:00.904
This is Brittany
at Dr. Olsen's office.

22:00.946 --> 22:03.407
Eric missed his 9 A.M.
Please call to reschedule.

22:04.616 --> 22:06.702
Hi. Hello.
My name is Nancy Riverton,

22:06.785 --> 22:09.788
and your son Jeremy
missed his bus

22:09.872 --> 22:12.499
at the rest stop on Route 6.

22:12.583 --> 22:14.877
He's fine. He's safe.
Don't worry. He's with me.

22:14.960 --> 22:16.879
But if you could just
give me a call...

22:16.962 --> 22:18.755
What were the names
of the Archer children?

22:18.839 --> 22:20.299
Eric and Daniel.
No Jeremy.

22:20.382 --> 22:22.593
And she said she picked up
this kid on Route 6.

22:22.634 --> 22:23.844
It's him.

22:26.305 --> 22:29.099
Hey, I need an address
for a number... 515...

22:29.141 --> 22:30.475
that's Des Moines.

22:30.559 --> 22:32.769
Name is Nancy Riverton.

22:55.209 --> 22:57.127
It's all right. We're the FBI.
You guys are safe now.

22:57.169 --> 22:58.629
It's ok.
You're gonna be ok.

22:58.712 --> 23:01.131
He left with my mom.
He's got a knife.

23:01.173 --> 23:02.966
He woke us up in the
middle of the night.

23:03.050 --> 23:04.301
He said it was a game.

23:04.343 --> 23:07.346
You've got to find them.

23:07.429 --> 23:09.264
It's ok.
You guys are ok.

23:10.891 --> 23:13.977
It's all right.
Ok.

23:15.896 --> 23:18.649
Do you want a soda or a burger?

23:18.732 --> 23:20.150
You must be starving.

23:20.234 --> 23:22.361
I'm not gonna fall for that.

23:23.654 --> 23:25.113
You'd leave me there.

23:25.155 --> 23:27.032
I wouldn't do that.

23:30.702 --> 23:33.413
Your mother shouldn't
have left you.

23:33.497 --> 23:35.374
I'm sure she's sorry.

23:35.457 --> 23:37.251
She will be.

23:41.171 --> 23:43.423
Where's your dad?

23:43.507 --> 23:45.676
He died when I was little.

23:45.759 --> 23:46.677
I'm sorry.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.262
Do you know where
he took our mom?

23:48.345 --> 23:51.306
Not yet. But there are a whole lot
of people looking for her right now.

23:51.390 --> 23:53.642
Did this boy tell you his name,

23:53.725 --> 23:55.519
where he lives, goes to school?

23:55.602 --> 23:58.856
He said he was going to his
aunt's house in Chicago.

23:58.939 --> 24:01.191
But he lives in Omaha.

24:01.275 --> 24:03.235
He said his name is Jeremy.

24:03.318 --> 24:04.736
It's ok. It's ok.
Just take your time.

24:04.820 --> 24:07.239
I just want you to try
and tell me about this game.

24:07.322 --> 24:10.200
It wasn't a game.
He just wanted to scare my mom.

24:10.284 --> 24:12.703
When your mom saw you
tied up on the floor,

24:12.786 --> 24:13.871
what did she do?

24:13.954 --> 24:15.914
It was weird.

24:15.998 --> 24:18.542
She told him he didn't
do anything wrong.

24:18.625 --> 24:22.045
All this stuff about how he's a
good kid and just made a mistake.

24:22.087 --> 24:25.215
Why would she say that
after what he did to us?

24:25.299 --> 24:29.970
Zack, it sounds like your mom
understood how dangerous Jeremy is,

24:30.053 --> 24:32.097
and she needed
to get him out of the house.

24:32.181 --> 24:36.685
It's like she made him
a deal or something.

24:36.768 --> 24:40.022
She said she'd drive him
anywhere he wants to go.

24:40.105 --> 24:41.356
And what was his answer?

24:41.440 --> 24:43.567
He said he wanted to go home.

24:46.236 --> 24:48.071
Do you play any sports?

24:48.113 --> 24:49.907
I seem like
a team player to you?

24:49.948 --> 24:53.619
There must be something
you like at school.

24:53.702 --> 24:56.205
A club or a class?

24:56.246 --> 24:58.123
I like science.

25:01.251 --> 25:02.878
I like...

25:02.961 --> 25:06.548
Taking things apart.

25:09.301 --> 25:12.429
Do you ever wonder
what's under your skin?

25:13.805 --> 25:15.390
Nope.

25:15.474 --> 25:17.100
I don't.

25:17.184 --> 25:20.062
Monica Archer called a friend at the
Northern Omaha children's hospital

25:20.145 --> 25:21.438
about an abandoned
13-year-old boy.

25:21.480 --> 25:23.106
Monica was going to
bring him in the next day.

25:23.148 --> 25:24.775
We need to talk to that friend.

25:24.858 --> 25:26.109
Oh, no, I already did that.

25:26.193 --> 25:28.278
Apparently the children's
hospital and child services

25:28.362 --> 25:29.613
have a strong rapport.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.156
Did she get a name?

25:31.240 --> 25:32.908
Yeah. She said the child's
name was Niko Bellic,

25:32.991 --> 25:34.076
and his hometown
was Newton, Iowa.

25:34.159 --> 25:36.912
Say that again...
Niko Bellic?

25:36.995 --> 25:38.622
The thing about that is that...

25:38.705 --> 25:40.249
Nico Bellic is the name
of a main character

25:40.290 --> 25:42.501
in "Grand Theft Auto IV."

25:44.753 --> 25:46.004
What? I know things.

25:46.088 --> 25:47.631
Guys, he's headed due East
on route 6.

25:47.714 --> 25:49.424
It passes right through Newton.

25:49.508 --> 25:51.802
He probably didn't expect the question
and gave away his real hometown.

25:51.885 --> 25:53.804
Garcia, call the Iowa
State Police, tell them

25:53.887 --> 25:56.473
to be on the lookout for a minivan
headed East towards route 6.

25:56.557 --> 25:57.766
Will do.

26:00.561 --> 26:05.107
If I open this up, you think
the air bag will blow out?

26:06.483 --> 26:10.612
Why don't you try it,
see what happens.

26:17.619 --> 26:19.538
Zack's a little punk.

26:21.248 --> 26:24.168
But, Amber,
she'll be hot, though,

26:24.251 --> 26:26.879
when she's older.

26:26.962 --> 26:29.548
You know, if I wanted,

26:29.631 --> 26:32.050
I could climb into her room
some night

26:32.134 --> 26:34.428
when you're all sleeping.

26:34.511 --> 26:36.096
Or you could just
ring the doorbell

26:36.180 --> 26:38.015
and come over to dinner
sometime.

26:38.056 --> 26:40.142
Don't lie!

26:43.729 --> 26:45.189
You think I'm a bad kid.

26:45.230 --> 26:46.523
I never said that.

26:46.565 --> 26:47.941
You didn't have to.

26:50.235 --> 26:52.654
2,200 families in Newton
have kids under the age of 18.

26:52.738 --> 26:53.989
In other words, a lot.

26:54.072 --> 26:55.866
He would have acted out
long before now.

26:55.908 --> 26:58.535
He's got a juvie record,
he's well known to truant officers,

26:58.577 --> 27:01.246
and he's probably been kicked
out of school, maybe several.

27:01.330 --> 27:03.040
We thought he was running
away, but he's heading home.

27:03.081 --> 27:04.499
He's got a plan.

27:04.541 --> 27:05.876
Taking his rage out
on surrogate mothers

27:05.918 --> 27:07.044
isn't doing it for him anymore.

27:07.085 --> 27:08.712
Now he's ready
for the real thing.

27:08.795 --> 27:11.882
Garcia, we need to I.D. this kid so
we can find his mom and warn her.

27:11.965 --> 27:13.342
Got it.

27:14.927 --> 27:16.178
Emily, get her back.

27:16.261 --> 27:17.179
Everybody?

27:17.262 --> 27:18.263
No, just Garcia.

27:18.347 --> 27:19.723
I haven't found her yet.

27:19.765 --> 27:21.183
Hey, it's me.

27:21.266 --> 27:22.226
Can anyone hear us?

27:22.267 --> 27:23.894
If by anyone,
you mean 9-year-old girls

27:23.977 --> 27:25.896
getting snacks,
then no. What's up?

27:25.938 --> 27:28.232
I want you to try and find
Ellie's mom.

27:28.273 --> 27:29.900
L.A. county
couldn't find her.

27:29.983 --> 27:31.360
They're not you, baby girl.

27:31.443 --> 27:33.237
They sure aren't.

27:33.278 --> 27:35.072
I'll get back to you.

27:38.784 --> 27:43.080
You know, Zack, he's not
the goody-good boy you think he is.

27:44.289 --> 27:47.918
Do you know what websites
he looks at?

27:47.960 --> 27:52.256
You think your kid
is so special.

27:52.297 --> 27:54.758
But underneath,
he's just like me.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.802
You're a good kid,
in your heart.

27:56.885 --> 27:58.971
Why do you keep saying that?

27:59.054 --> 28:02.224
Because I believe
that children are born good.

28:02.307 --> 28:04.351
Your feelings are hurt.
You're angry.

28:04.434 --> 28:06.019
You're acting out.

28:06.103 --> 28:07.354
I don't blame you.

28:07.437 --> 28:10.274
My mom blames me
for everything.

28:10.315 --> 28:12.985
My dad left.

28:13.068 --> 28:14.611
My sister gets hurt.

28:14.653 --> 28:16.613
It's all my fault.

28:16.655 --> 28:19.616
I don't blame you.

28:19.658 --> 28:22.369
I think you need help.

28:22.452 --> 28:26.790
I think you need love
and attention.

28:26.874 --> 28:28.959
None of this is your fault.

28:32.045 --> 28:33.797
You can pull over.

28:33.839 --> 28:36.216
We're almost to my house.

28:36.300 --> 28:37.885
I'll take you home like I said.

28:37.968 --> 28:42.139
I'm not that stupid, Nancy.

28:42.181 --> 28:45.642
I'm not gonna show you
where I live.

28:45.684 --> 28:47.853
Now pull over.

28:47.936 --> 28:50.063
I'll walk from here.

28:56.195 --> 28:58.405
Well, here we are.

28:59.740 --> 29:02.826
You couldn't wait
to get away from me, huh?

29:02.910 --> 29:05.120
No.

29:05.204 --> 29:08.123
Admit you can't stand me.

29:08.207 --> 29:09.875
That's not true.

29:09.958 --> 29:12.294
I like you.

29:12.377 --> 29:13.670
Ohh!

29:42.449 --> 29:45.744
32 kids with juvie records have been absent
from school in the last 3 days.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.496
I can send police
to their mothers,

29:47.538 --> 29:48.956
I can start calling houses...

29:49.039 --> 29:50.916
no, Garcia, we don't have time
for trial by error,

29:50.958 --> 29:52.084
we gotta narrow it down.

29:52.125 --> 29:54.253
Ok, the kids at the last house
said that the unsub

29:54.294 --> 29:55.587
liked to play a game.

29:55.671 --> 29:57.089
He liked tying the kids up
and scaring them

29:57.172 --> 29:58.590
and he knew what he was doing.

29:58.674 --> 30:00.592
He used socks and belts.

30:00.676 --> 30:02.511
He's done it before, Garcia.

30:02.594 --> 30:03.762
So you want me to look for kids

30:03.846 --> 30:05.597
who've picked on their little
brothers and sisters?

30:05.681 --> 30:08.600
I'm an only child, but isn't
that standard for you people with siblings?

30:08.684 --> 30:10.602
Budding psychopaths don't
just pick on their siblings.

30:10.686 --> 30:12.104
They torture them.

30:12.145 --> 30:14.773
Ok, well, none of them have assault records.
Not yet, anyway.

30:14.857 --> 30:16.775
Is there any way
to see if any of the younger siblings

30:16.817 --> 30:19.236
have been in the emergency room
in the last 6 months?

30:19.278 --> 30:22.990
Medical info like that
is molasses slow to get, unless I...

30:24.700 --> 30:26.493
Please hold for genius.

30:35.419 --> 30:38.130
Got it. I figured
a suspicious visit to the E.R.

30:38.213 --> 30:40.424
Might end up in a social
services report and it did.

30:40.465 --> 30:43.635
10 days ago, the admitting doctor called
about a Sayer family

30:43.719 --> 30:45.429
at 1365 Hunter Drive.

30:45.470 --> 30:48.307
Jeremy Sayer is a 13-year-old

30:48.390 --> 30:52.269
with a disturbingly long
juvie record.

30:52.311 --> 30:56.023
Wow. His 9-year-old sister Carrie was
brought to the hospital

30:56.106 --> 30:57.649
with a spiral arm fracture.

30:57.733 --> 31:00.861
The kind you get from having your arm
twisted behind your back too far.

31:08.660 --> 31:10.621
You want to play a game?

31:10.662 --> 31:11.872
No.

31:11.955 --> 31:13.999
Kendra Sayer's boss
said she left work already.

31:14.041 --> 31:16.502
I have her cell phone.
What do you have on Mr. Sayer?

31:16.543 --> 31:18.378
He moved to Wisconsin
3 years ago.

31:18.462 --> 31:20.339
I'm looking at the phone
records right now.

31:20.380 --> 31:23.008
He hasn't contacted the family
in 10 months.

31:23.050 --> 31:26.011
Mom, we've been through this.

31:26.094 --> 31:27.596
Woman, on cell phone speaker:
There had to be another option

31:27.679 --> 31:31.475
than just abandoning your own flesh
and blood by the side of the road.

31:31.517 --> 31:34.144
It wasn't the side of the road.

31:34.186 --> 31:36.396
Do you want him
to come live with you?

31:40.025 --> 31:41.777
That's what I thought.

31:41.860 --> 31:44.112
What area code is 202?

31:44.196 --> 31:46.031
I don't know.
New York, maybe.

31:46.114 --> 31:48.909
Look, I had to protect Carrie.

31:48.992 --> 31:51.954
She was so terrified of him,
she wouldn't admit he broke her arm.

31:52.037 --> 31:53.580
She sent me to voicemail again.

31:53.664 --> 31:55.374
Keep trying.

31:55.457 --> 31:56.750
Did you see him break her arm?

31:56.834 --> 31:57.918
No, mom, of course I didn't.

31:58.001 --> 31:59.086
Then how are you sure?

31:59.169 --> 32:00.754
For the same reason I was sure

32:00.838 --> 32:03.590
when I found rat pellets
in the Thanksgiving turkey.

32:03.674 --> 32:05.092
For the same reason I was sure

32:05.175 --> 32:06.760
when our neighbor's dog
went missing.

32:07.845 --> 32:10.764
Sorry. This person
keeps calling.

32:10.848 --> 32:12.224
Hello?

32:12.307 --> 32:14.935
Mrs. Sayer, this is
Agent Prentiss from the FBI.

32:15.018 --> 32:16.854
I need to talk to you
about your son Jeremy.

32:16.895 --> 32:20.858
I don't have a son.
I... I don't know what you're talking about.

32:20.899 --> 32:23.360
Mrs. Sayer, it's important
that you and your daughter

32:23.402 --> 32:28.240
stay away from your home. We have reason
to believe Jeremy's heading there now.

32:29.491 --> 32:30.951
Oh, God.

32:31.034 --> 32:32.452
He's here.

32:32.536 --> 32:33.620
He's in the house.

32:33.704 --> 32:35.789
Ma'am, do not go inside
the house.

32:35.873 --> 32:37.457
We'll be there in 2 minutes.

32:37.541 --> 32:39.501
I have to go inside.
He's got Carrie.

32:42.629 --> 32:45.632
Carrie! Carrie? Carrie?

32:45.716 --> 32:47.050
Hi, mom.

32:49.219 --> 32:52.306
Jeremy, let her go, please.

32:53.807 --> 32:55.434
No! Please, please!

32:55.475 --> 32:58.604
Sure thing. But I want you
to tell me the truth first.

32:58.645 --> 33:00.022
Truth? What truth?

33:00.105 --> 33:01.273
That you always hated me.

33:01.356 --> 33:03.775
Jeremy... Jeremy, please,
just let her go.

33:03.817 --> 33:08.780
Admit it. Admit it and I won't
hurt your little sugarplum.

33:08.822 --> 33:11.783
I don't know... I don't know what me to say.
I don't. I swear.

33:11.867 --> 33:15.579
Say what I heard you telling
Father Quincy.

33:16.830 --> 33:19.625
Say it!

33:19.708 --> 33:21.293
Oh, my God. I... I...

33:21.335 --> 33:22.961
confess and be forgiven!

33:23.003 --> 33:25.339
Isn't that what
you always tell me?

33:25.422 --> 33:27.049
I was pregnant with twins.

33:27.132 --> 33:28.884
And then one day I wasn't.

33:28.967 --> 33:30.969
Is that what you want to hear?

33:31.011 --> 33:34.223
The doctor said one fetus
consumed the other.

33:34.306 --> 33:36.725
I wasn't even born yet
and you blamed me?!

33:36.808 --> 33:38.143
You are rotten to the core!
You always have been.

33:38.185 --> 33:40.729
FBI! Drop your weapon.

33:40.812 --> 33:41.897
Maybe I made you into a monster

33:41.980 --> 33:43.315
because I hated you
when you were inside me!

33:43.357 --> 33:45.817
But I think I hated you
because I knew what you were!

33:45.901 --> 33:47.778
Don't do it, Jeremy.

33:47.819 --> 33:49.947
Do you want to die?

33:49.988 --> 33:52.991
You won't shoot me when mommy's
little angel can get hurt.

33:53.075 --> 33:54.159
Yes or no?

33:54.243 --> 33:56.620
I'll cut her neck open.

33:56.662 --> 33:57.829
I know how to do it.

33:57.871 --> 33:59.623
No, please!
I've practiced.

33:59.665 --> 34:01.708
I'm not gonna ask you
again, Jeremy.

34:01.792 --> 34:03.585
You can't shoot a kid.

34:03.669 --> 34:06.839
I can shoot a killer.
And I will, believe that.

34:06.880 --> 34:10.384
If that knife even twitches, I'm gonna
put a bullet right through your brain.

34:14.221 --> 34:16.014
If I let her go...

34:16.056 --> 34:17.349
there is no if.

34:18.766 --> 34:19.810
Fine.

34:23.981 --> 34:26.149
I was only kidding, anyway.

34:26.190 --> 34:27.650
Turn around.

34:29.695 --> 34:33.031
Aah! Ah! Mom, he's hurting me!

34:33.072 --> 34:36.284
It's gonna be all right.
Mom, I can't go by myself!

34:36.368 --> 34:38.911
Mom!

34:38.996 --> 34:41.206
Mom! Mom! Mom!

34:41.290 --> 34:42.456
Settle down.

34:42.541 --> 34:44.543
Your mother's not coming.

34:44.585 --> 34:46.003
Whatever.

34:47.838 --> 34:49.882
I'm 13.

34:49.922 --> 34:52.217
I'll see her in 5 years anyway.

34:52.259 --> 34:53.552
Don't count on it.

34:53.635 --> 34:55.053
I'm gonna be at every one
of your parole hearings,

34:55.137 --> 34:56.388
and that's a promise.

34:56.429 --> 34:58.640
Now get in the car.

35:04.479 --> 35:06.607
Nancy Riverton got out of surgery.
She's gonna make it.

35:06.690 --> 35:07.608
She's lucky.

35:07.691 --> 35:09.067
She managed to control him
long enough

35:09.151 --> 35:11.236
to save her children.
She's impressive.

35:11.320 --> 35:13.572
Mrs. Sayer asked that she and
her daughter be notified

35:13.614 --> 35:16.325
if and when Jeremy is released.

35:16.408 --> 35:18.160
Bau should keep his file
handy, too.

35:18.243 --> 35:19.494
Excuse me.

35:22.915 --> 35:25.292
I heard Garcia found
Ellie's mom.

35:25.375 --> 35:26.710
Yeah.

35:26.793 --> 35:30.172
She had a hard time
being married to a cop,

35:30.255 --> 35:33.383
so she moved back East
for a while.

35:33.467 --> 35:35.135
She travels a lot.

35:35.219 --> 35:36.803
You think that's a solution?

35:39.097 --> 35:41.350
I just don't know how she
could leave that little girl.

35:41.433 --> 35:43.101
She probably left
a bad marriage.

35:43.143 --> 35:45.270
Hotch, that's her child.

35:45.312 --> 35:48.106
How does she just walk out
of her life like that?

35:48.190 --> 35:51.235
Maybe she didn't have
any other options.

35:51.276 --> 35:53.737
Most parents try to do
what's best for their kids.

35:53.779 --> 35:57.783
Maybe being with her dad in
California was more stable?

35:57.866 --> 36:00.744
Her mom couldn't
offer her that?

36:00.786 --> 36:04.748
Kids are adaptable, but they need
somebody they can depend on.

36:04.790 --> 36:07.543
Maybe her mom
can give her that now.

36:09.795 --> 36:12.214
How will I know?

36:13.215 --> 36:15.133
You'll know.

36:34.319 --> 36:35.988
Agent Morgan?

36:36.029 --> 36:37.573
Ma'am.

36:40.617 --> 36:42.578
You weren't easy to find.

36:42.619 --> 36:44.329
I just got back to the States.

36:44.413 --> 36:46.999
So you didn't know about Matt?

36:47.082 --> 36:48.792
I had no idea.

36:50.252 --> 36:52.504
I'm so sorry.

37:03.390 --> 37:06.018
Hey, you.

37:08.478 --> 37:10.898
Look, I get it.

37:10.981 --> 37:13.400
You and your ex-husband
had your share of problems,

37:13.483 --> 37:15.194
so you separated.

37:15.235 --> 37:17.821
But how could you
not be in Ellie's life?

37:17.863 --> 37:19.531
I tried.

37:19.573 --> 37:21.533
Matt pushed me away.

37:21.617 --> 37:24.203
Said they were better
without me.

37:24.286 --> 37:25.829
Were they?

37:25.871 --> 37:27.122
I wasn't happy.

37:28.582 --> 37:30.876
Matt and I...

37:34.505 --> 37:37.591
Ellie used to walk around
with the biggest frown.

37:37.633 --> 37:41.386
And I thought
I had done that to her.

37:42.971 --> 37:46.058
She's angry because
that's how she sees me.

37:46.141 --> 37:48.227
So what are you saying?

37:48.310 --> 37:49.811
You're better now?

37:52.606 --> 37:56.276
I've wondered if you'd like
the places I've been.

37:56.360 --> 37:59.279
If you still took ballet.

37:59.363 --> 38:02.741
If tulips
are still your favorite.

38:07.371 --> 38:09.331
Go ahead.

38:09.414 --> 38:11.875
Look at it.

38:27.599 --> 38:31.603
You wrote to her every day.

38:31.645 --> 38:33.272
So what?

38:34.690 --> 38:36.233
Ellie...

38:36.275 --> 38:38.527
She wrote to me every day.

38:38.610 --> 38:39.987
Who cares?

38:48.537 --> 38:51.331
Hey.

38:51.415 --> 38:55.752
This book means that
your mom never stopped thinking about you.

38:58.547 --> 39:02.092
Ellie, you know that I lost my father
the same way that you did.

39:05.095 --> 39:09.933
And it's really hard
growing up without your dad.

39:09.975 --> 39:13.020
I miss my dad every day.

39:14.062 --> 39:16.481
But my mom,

39:16.523 --> 39:19.484
she means everything to me.

39:20.777 --> 39:24.448
I gave your dad my word
that I would keep you safe.

39:25.657 --> 39:27.784
Ellie, right now
you have a chance

39:27.826 --> 39:30.746
to have a really good life
with your mom.

39:37.544 --> 39:40.047
Just give it a try.

40:01.026 --> 40:07.074
I remember that we used to read
stories together all the time.

40:07.115 --> 40:09.368
I miss that.

40:09.451 --> 40:11.787
Me, too.

40:14.248 --> 40:16.625
Let me show you something.

40:16.708 --> 40:17.960
Ok.

40:26.134 --> 40:27.761
Thank you.

40:47.155 --> 40:49.575
"But I have promises to keep

40:49.658 --> 40:52.411
"and miles to go
before I sleep.

40:52.494 --> 40:54.913
And miles to go before I sleep."
