00:21.187 --> 00:24.486
Hello! Hello and welcome!
Thank you very much.

00:25.458 --> 00:30.589
Now, as you know, the producers
on this show like to give us challenges,

00:30.663 --> 00:34.565
specifically where they give us a very small
amount of money and tell us to buy a used car

00:34.634 --> 00:39.936
then they set unbelievably hard tasks to do
to see which one of us got the best deal.

00:40.006 --> 00:44.409
Yeah. This week for a Top Gear special
they came up with a real humdinger.

00:44.477 --> 00:47.105
They gave each of us 1500 quid

00:47.180 --> 00:49.205
and told us to go to Africa...

00:49.282 --> 00:51.250
- (Laughter)
...and buy a car.

00:51.317 --> 00:53.114
Yeah, and there were just two conditions:

00:53.186 --> 00:54.983
It mustn't be four-wheel drive

00:55.055 --> 00:58.752
and it mustn't be built,
in any way, to go off road.

01:00.427 --> 01:02.019
(Barking)

01:03.663 --> 01:08.760
(James) The meeting point was the border post
between Zimbabwe and Botswana.

01:08.835 --> 01:11.895
And, for once, I was the first to arrive.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.539
Now, as you'd expect, I've done this properly.

01:17.610 --> 01:24.482
What I've got is a 1985 Mercedes-Benz 230E,
a car that Africa absolutely adores

01:24.551 --> 01:28.715
because it's comfortable, it's rugged,
it's dependable and, frankly,

01:28.788 --> 01:32.485
if the other two have brought anything other
than one of these along, they're idiots.

01:33.993 --> 01:36.461
The first idiot arrived.

01:38.598 --> 01:42.398
- Can you open the door? The handle's broken.
- It is a Lancia Beta.

01:42.469 --> 01:44.334
Coupé, 1981.

01:45.138 --> 01:51.338
The only Lancia of any sort in the whole of
Botswana. It's done 29,000 miles.

01:51.411 --> 01:54.005
Mm. One owner, is it?

01:54.080 --> 01:55.775
It was a little old lady.

01:55.849 --> 01:58.044
(Jeremy) And boy had she ragged it.

01:58.118 --> 02:01.576
(James) Yeah, that's normal, isn't it? That
fizzing.

02:01.654 --> 02:04.179
That's er... Yeah.

02:04.257 --> 02:07.124
What's the piece of cardboard for?
Is that for mopping up moisture?

02:07.193 --> 02:10.060
- No that's because the battery...
- Oh, it shorts on the bonnet.

02:10.130 --> 02:13.258
- Shorts on the bonnet a bit.
- Right. You've done well.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.130
So now what? Do you want a lift?

02:15.201 --> 02:20.229
(James) We left the Lancia to cool down
because Hammond was arriving.

02:20.306 --> 02:23.707
- What the hell is that?
- I dunno.

02:23.776 --> 02:26.939
(Jeremy) Could it be a Moskvitch? Ju... Opel!
(James) It's an Opel!

02:27.013 --> 02:29.345
(Jeremy) And on the front it says Kadett.

02:32.218 --> 02:33.344
Yeah!

02:33.419 --> 02:35.319
(Jeremy)
What the hell have you done, man?

02:35.388 --> 02:39.119
It's an Opel Kadett from 1963.

02:39.192 --> 02:42.355
- (Snorts) So that's the same age as you.
- Same age as me.

02:42.428 --> 02:44.521
Yes, but it's much better nick than you are.

02:44.597 --> 02:48.363
It was 1200 pounds. I had much change
with which to buy many beads.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.441
- I love the speedo.
- I do like a horizontal speedo.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.204
- I really do.
- (Laughing)

02:58.278 --> 03:00.644
- Where's the engine? Hold on.
- It's there.

03:00.713 --> 03:02.203
(James) It's tiny!

03:02.282 --> 03:04.341
- Do you wanna know about the power?
- Yes, I do.

03:04.417 --> 03:06.214
- 40.
- 40?

03:06.286 --> 03:08.550
- 40 horsepower?
- Well, they did do a sport version

03:08.621 --> 03:10.646
with 48 but I didn't want anything too lairy.

03:14.394 --> 03:16.385
- (James) You've both been idiots.
- No!

03:16.462 --> 03:18.487
Brilliantly interesting, brilliantly stylish

03:18.565 --> 03:20.999
- but stupid.
- Why's mine stupid?

03:21.067 --> 03:22.625
What is yours? Where is yours?

03:22.702 --> 03:24.226
Whoa! (Laughs)

03:24.304 --> 03:26.932
A Lancia? You have been a bit thick.

03:28.241 --> 03:31.802
(Jeremy) With the cars at the start line
it was time for our challenge.

03:36.416 --> 03:39.146
"The people of Surrey think
they need four-wheel drive cars

03:39.219 --> 03:42.188
"because they live up a lane
which sometimes has leaves on it.

03:42.255 --> 03:46.521
"You will now attempt to prove them wrong
by driving your two-wheel drive cars

03:46.593 --> 03:51.087
"from here on Botswana's eastern border
with Zimbabwe..." Just there.

03:51.164 --> 03:56.727
"...1000 miles to its western border
with Namibia.

03:56.803 --> 03:59.966
"That's right across the spine of Africa."

04:05.445 --> 04:06.969
I'm confident.

04:07.046 --> 04:08.536
(Jeremy) I wasn't.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.515
We hadn't even started
and the Lancia was playing up.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.611
(Engine revs, fails)

04:22.295 --> 04:25.822
James chose not to wait.

04:25.898 --> 04:28.059
He may be mechanically confident

04:28.134 --> 04:31.501
but he has just turned right
which is Zimbabwe.

04:31.571 --> 04:34.631
Which is where, I should point out,
the BBC is not allowed.

04:34.707 --> 04:36.971
- (Richard) Oh, hello!
- (Both laugh)

04:37.043 --> 04:39.273
"Sorry, sorry. I'm going now."

04:41.748 --> 04:46.048
The Lancia wheezed into life
and Hammond and I set off in pursuit.

04:56.729 --> 04:58.788
If you think of the cars that this inspired.

04:58.865 --> 05:04.235
It was latterly built in Russia where it became
the Moskvitch, which was rubbish.

05:04.937 --> 05:08.634
And, of course, indirectly, the Vauxhall Astra.

05:08.708 --> 05:12.769
Quite a lot of reasonably average cars
owe themselves to this.

05:15.515 --> 05:18.313
I don't know if you know
but Africa is really quite large.

05:18.384 --> 05:22.047
And when you're out in a very remote part
you need a car like this,

05:22.121 --> 05:25.090
that can be mended with a brick
and a piece of string.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.887
What you have to remember

05:26.959 --> 05:32.056
is that three of the most rugged and
successful rally cars ever made were Lancias -

05:32.131 --> 05:36.966
the Stratos, the 037 and the Delta Integrale.

05:37.036 --> 05:39.402
Lancia know how to make a rally car.

05:40.773 --> 05:46.678
Unfortunately, on the day my Beta Coupé
was made they obviously forgot everything.

05:46.746 --> 05:51.206
The gear box is broken, the steering's broken,
the window's broken.

05:51.284 --> 05:54.014
In fact, we all had problems.

05:54.087 --> 05:58.854
Everything works, except this knob,
which controls the blower.

05:58.925 --> 06:03.021
I've got to have the windows open because
there's quite a strong smell of petrol.

06:03.096 --> 06:06.293
And that mirror over there
which is actually slightly stuck.

06:06.366 --> 06:10.826
Hazard warning lights, the clock, the fan,
the handbrake, all of the dials.

06:10.903 --> 06:13.667
The brakes are terrible
because they only work on that wheel.

06:13.740 --> 06:17.176
They work very well on that wheel,
but only on that wheel.

06:17.243 --> 06:18.801
And that instrument's a bit wobbly.

06:18.878 --> 06:23.611
Apart from that everything that's actually
important to the car works perfectly.

06:23.683 --> 06:27.210
Apart from the handbrake,
which I can pull like this as we go along.

06:29.455 --> 06:34.722
This is just the happiest car in the world.
I should call it Oliver,

06:34.794 --> 06:37.729
not that we'd ever name a car on Top Gear.
I wish I hadn't said that.

06:38.798 --> 06:43.929
It's now five past ten in the morning
and it's starting to get quite hot.

06:44.003 --> 06:45.971
I've got an idea.

06:52.044 --> 06:54.274
Oh yeah, that's better.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.605
Don't know what that is.

06:56.682 --> 06:59.276
(Croaky horn)

06:59.352 --> 07:00.751
A horn!

07:02.088 --> 07:04.249
Oh, Oliver! You've got a cold. Listen.

07:04.323 --> 07:06.120
(Sounds horn, coughs)

07:08.094 --> 07:12.793
(James) We were having fun but then we
discovered we were traveling with Bill 0ddie.

07:12.865 --> 07:15.197
- Why have you got a pen?
- You tick them off when you've seen them.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.532
Hornbill, Southern Yellow-billed.

07:17.603 --> 07:20.572
...to even look at your car. It's massive!

07:20.640 --> 07:24.667
Don't knock Oliver... Don't knock my car.
That's a fine... he's a fine...

07:24.744 --> 07:27.440
- What did you call it then?
- Oliver's a friend of mine...

07:27.513 --> 07:30.778
- He's given it a name.
- He's given his car a name.

07:35.221 --> 07:38.281
(Jeremy) So far, the journey
had been a doddle.

07:40.126 --> 07:43.892
But then the tarmac just sort of stopped.

07:49.702 --> 07:50.794
Oh, this is bad.

07:50.870 --> 07:52.633
(James) I can see from here just how hard

07:52.705 --> 07:56.232
the suspension on Jeremy's Lancia
is having to work. It's just a blur.

07:59.111 --> 08:00.840
Come on, Oliver. Please!

08:00.913 --> 08:05.941
The later you book a lift in the Mercedes, the
more expensive it gets. It's a bit like an airline.

08:06.018 --> 08:08.452
Oh God! Oh!

08:08.521 --> 08:10.421
I've broken it.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.287
Engine isn't working. It's cut out.

08:12.358 --> 08:13.518
Oh dear.

08:13.593 --> 08:17.188
- He's done literally one kilometer of this.
- I know what's wrong with it.

08:17.263 --> 08:18.389
The bonnet won't open.

08:18.464 --> 08:20.659
- It's the bonnet catch, it's...
- Shut up!

08:20.733 --> 08:24.134
(Jeremy) Hammond was tetchy
because he knew the price of failure.

08:24.203 --> 08:29.072
Anyone who's car broke down
would have to complete the journey in a Beetle.

08:29.141 --> 08:30.768
(Horror film music)

08:33.880 --> 08:36.405
It is collectively our
least favorite car in the world.

08:36.482 --> 08:38.177
- Ooh, yes.
- It is the punishment.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.410
Please!

08:40.419 --> 08:41.852
Oh! Hang on! Hang on!

08:42.621 --> 08:43.645
Ooh!

08:43.722 --> 08:45.714
(Engine revs, starts)

08:45.791 --> 08:47.224
Come on, Oliver!

08:47.293 --> 08:48.419
What did you say?

08:48.494 --> 08:50.826
I said, "Oli... Oli... I love ya!"

08:50.897 --> 08:53.092
- Oh my God.
- (James) What now?

08:53.165 --> 08:55.998
My car's on fire,
but in a very specific place.

08:56.068 --> 08:58.730
(James) Wow! Look at that.
(Jeremy) It was a magnifying glass?

08:58.804 --> 09:01.705
- There's a laser beam coming through it.
- It's like you dropped acid on it.

09:01.774 --> 09:03.674
(James) Oh, his piece of cardboard's gone.

09:03.743 --> 09:05.734
(Richard) So it sets itself on fire.

09:05.811 --> 09:08.211
(Jeremy) If you don't
have a piece of cardboard.

09:10.850 --> 09:14.183
(Jeremy) We drove deeper and deeper
into the bush.

09:16.989 --> 09:18.251
Lancia, yeah!

09:20.993 --> 09:22.221
What is that?

09:24.630 --> 09:26.291
Looks like the sea.

09:28.234 --> 09:31.533
(Jeremy) Eventually the road
disappeared altogether.

09:36.208 --> 09:38.642
People of Surrey, I hope you're watching this.

09:38.711 --> 09:40.804
We are... (Laughs)

09:41.747 --> 09:44.580
...driving a Lancia Beta Coupé,

09:44.650 --> 09:47.016
well, just in the middle of...

09:47.086 --> 09:48.781
whatever you call this.

09:53.559 --> 09:57.689
The good news was we'd successfully
reached our campsite for the night.

09:57.763 --> 10:01.529
The bad news came
in the shape of another challenge.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.331
"Stretching before you is the Makgadikgadi.

10:07.106 --> 10:09.404
"These are the biggest salt flats in the world,

10:09.475 --> 10:13.639
"almost completely lifeless
and as wide as Portugal.

10:13.713 --> 10:16.773
"No car has ever driven across them.

10:16.849 --> 10:19.317
"If you run out of water you will die.

10:19.385 --> 10:23.185
"If your car breaks down
and you can't be rescued you will die.

10:23.255 --> 10:25.780
"If you run out of food you will die.

10:25.858 --> 10:28.156
"It's like driving on a creme brulée.

10:28.227 --> 10:31.993
"There's a primeval ooze
covered with a thin layer of salty crust.

10:32.064 --> 10:37.661
"If you have thin tires you will break through
that crust, get stuck and you will die."

10:37.737 --> 10:43.573
So it advises to fit fat tires and remove
as much weight as possible before setting off.

10:44.510 --> 10:47.206
- Well, how hard can it be?
- Don't say that!

10:48.881 --> 10:51.406
(Jeremy) In camp,
the weight-shedding began.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.473
Ready?

10:55.154 --> 10:56.883
That doesn't work.

11:00.893 --> 11:01.882
Thanks awfully.

11:01.961 --> 11:06.796
- Wow, feel how much this seat weighs.
- Like your work.

11:06.866 --> 11:08.561
(Groans, gasps)

11:16.042 --> 11:17.009
Ah!

11:17.076 --> 11:19.601
Fuel filler, I'll need that maybe.

11:21.047 --> 11:26.451
I don't want to take the hub caps off really
cos they protect the hubs.

11:27.753 --> 11:29.687
- Can I point something out?
- What?

11:29.755 --> 11:33.589
Hammond's walking round his car
muttering about how he needs all of it.

11:33.659 --> 11:35.422
I know exactly what he's doing.

11:35.494 --> 11:37.689
He's formed an emotional attachment,
hasn't he?

11:37.763 --> 11:40.994
It'd be like saying to him,
"Could you cut bits off your wife?"

11:46.706 --> 11:49.300
(Richard) The next morning,
on the edge of the salt pans,

11:49.375 --> 11:52.071
we thought we'd come under attack
from a Bond villain.

11:52.144 --> 11:55.580
But it turned out to be
the vice president of Botswana.

11:58.484 --> 12:00.714
(Richard) That is a (Beep) cool ride.
(Jeremy) It is.

12:00.786 --> 12:04.278
It's better than an official Rover 75
and a couple of policemen on motorbikes.

12:05.024 --> 12:08.016
He was amazed
to hear what was being planned.

12:08.094 --> 12:12.622
I've just never known anybody
to go across in a car.

12:12.698 --> 12:15.166
This'll be the first time, I think.

12:15.234 --> 12:18.203
- There they are.
- Oh, really?

12:18.270 --> 12:20.033
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

12:20.106 --> 12:23.439
- That should be interesting.
- You were smiling, you've just stopped.

12:25.044 --> 12:29.140
Buoyed by the vice president's optimism,
we set off.

12:36.155 --> 12:39.647
Nothing really prepares you
for the sheer size of these.

12:43.929 --> 12:48.059
I think, in a way, that it's more frightening
than the Pole. There's absolutely nothing.

12:48.134 --> 12:50.398
You can see the curvature of the earth.

12:52.772 --> 12:56.765
(Richard) As we ploughed on,
the little 0pel was going well.

12:56.842 --> 12:58.833
Oliver is just skipping. Boo!

12:59.745 --> 13:01.576
This car was born to do this.

13:02.548 --> 13:07.508
(Jeremy) Sadly, despite the weight-shedding,
my Lancia was not doing so well.

13:07.586 --> 13:11.716
Judging by the way the tires are kind of
digging in as I'm driving along,

13:11.791 --> 13:14.885
I think a little bit more has to come out.

13:14.960 --> 13:19.522
Still, as you can see from the tires' grooves,
I was doing better than the Merc.

13:22.034 --> 13:25.800
I'm looking at James' rear wheel
and he is digging in a long way.

13:25.871 --> 13:27.964
I tried to help him along.

13:28.440 --> 13:29.930
(Smashing)

13:30.009 --> 13:31.271
Really helpful.

13:31.343 --> 13:33.811
Well, there's always the Beetle, James.

13:33.879 --> 13:35.244
It's waiting for you.

13:38.717 --> 13:40.241
What are you gonna do? It's sinking.

13:40.319 --> 13:43.220
- We've done... How far's that? A mile?
- If that.

13:44.123 --> 13:46.489
My Lancia waded in again.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.083
(Richard) Just a nudge.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.253
- That's a crash
- (James) There's a thing.

13:50.329 --> 13:54.129
Unfortunately,
because it was an automatic, it was useless.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.724
So, we told Richard to try.

13:56.802 --> 13:59.202
But he didn't want to hurt 0liver.

13:59.271 --> 14:00.795
- (Smashing)
- (Richard groans)

14:00.873 --> 14:02.465
(Jeremy laughs)

14:03.475 --> 14:07.571
This was hopeless,
so we had to rope in the camera crew.

14:07.646 --> 14:10.513
(All) Three! Two! One! Hoy!

14:11.984 --> 14:16.853
Because the ooze was so bad, we had to get
even more drastic with the weight-shedding.

14:19.925 --> 14:22.485
We toiled away for hours.

14:22.561 --> 14:24.153
Da-da! Oh God!

14:24.864 --> 14:26.729
Well, two of us did.

14:26.799 --> 14:29.996
And then finally we were ready.

14:32.705 --> 14:36.971
Now, this is light.
Lancia Beta Coupé Superleggera!

14:42.781 --> 14:44.976
Not a modification! (Laughs)

14:46.619 --> 14:50.350
- This is excellent.
- Why don't all cars have no doors?

14:51.624 --> 14:53.649
When I come to power
I'm gonna make it a rule,

14:53.726 --> 14:55.421
cos this is just better.

15:01.300 --> 15:05.202
However, the Makgadikgadi was
not going to let us off that lightly.

15:05.271 --> 15:10.470
And soon even our super-lightweight cars
started to struggle again.

15:13.012 --> 15:15.242
(James) Come on, just... Oh!

15:16.749 --> 15:17.841
Oh, yes.

15:19.051 --> 15:20.746
No, this isn't good.

15:23.589 --> 15:24.817
Oh, no.

15:24.890 --> 15:28.348
(Richard)
0nly the 0pel remained trouble-free,

15:28.427 --> 15:30.361
which was bad news for me.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.056
(Richard groans)

15:32.131 --> 15:34.190
Yes! Come on, man!

15:34.266 --> 15:37.793
I'll go forwards, Hammond,
then we'll do it again. Hang on.

15:37.870 --> 15:42.864
- (Groans) How far is it?
- Five or six yards and we might be Bobby.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.409
Oh, this is just horrible!

15:44.476 --> 15:46.000
(Hissing)

15:47.980 --> 15:50.278
Keep going, keep going, keep going!
Keep going!

15:50.349 --> 15:51.611
Yes! Yes!

15:54.586 --> 15:55.575
(James) No!

15:55.654 --> 15:57.918
(Jeremy) James, don't go there.
You'll get stuck.

15:57.990 --> 15:59.048
That's close.

16:02.294 --> 16:03.625
Come on!

16:04.463 --> 16:06.328
(James) Oh, permission to say cock.

16:06.398 --> 16:10.027
- Can we have everybody? We'll push it off.
- (Richard) We need 100 men or more.

16:10.102 --> 16:11.262
(James) No!

16:12.671 --> 16:13.729
This is hopeless.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.797
(Groaning)

16:15.874 --> 16:19.708
People of Surrey,
you need four-wheel drive for this bit.

16:21.146 --> 16:26.607
(Jeremy) The gunk was so sticky it had
completely jammed the Lancia's rear wheels.

16:26.685 --> 16:30.985
I can't describe...
You just think it's just mud...

16:31.056 --> 16:32.455
Do you know what it is?

16:32.524 --> 16:37.086
Fish. It's just rotted prehistoric fish.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.289
One, two, three. (Groaning)

16:42.101 --> 16:46.697
Mercifully, the ground eventually hardened
and we made good progress.

16:46.772 --> 16:50.868
But then suddenly
the horizon was no longer flat.

16:54.980 --> 16:58.108
This is interesting. We're now coming
between what look like islands.

16:58.183 --> 17:02.119
And I suppose they are. This was a lake,
so they would have been islands.

17:02.187 --> 17:05.020
Amazing. Absolutely amazing.

17:17.036 --> 17:20.767
(Richard) Where are we?
(Jeremy) It's called Kubu Island.

17:23.008 --> 17:27.001
We're about... I'm trying to think.
...a third of the way across.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.912
And you've been stuck
about a thousand times.

17:29.982 --> 17:31.677
That is smug.

17:31.750 --> 17:35.686
A Baobab tree.
I've always wanted to see one of those.

17:35.754 --> 17:37.915
- Hammond, look at this.
- Whoa!

17:46.432 --> 17:50.129
It is just about the most astonishing place
I've ever been.

17:50.202 --> 17:51.931
(Richard) God, I'm with you there.

17:59.645 --> 18:03.046
(Jeremy) As the sun set,
we headed for the campsite.

18:21.166 --> 18:22.929
Day two on the salt pans,

18:23.001 --> 18:27.461
and we'd been told that today
our problem would not be mud but dust.

18:27.539 --> 18:31.498
That meant James and I
had to rethink our wardrobe solutions.

18:36.882 --> 18:40.340
(Jeremy)
I've teamed my keffiyeh with a bin liner.

18:40.752 --> 18:44.882
V-necked! The last time I wore one of these
I went to see the Clash.

18:44.957 --> 18:50.088
Frankly, I thought it was all a bit much.
I mean, how bad could this dust be?

18:51.330 --> 18:53.264
Aargh! My eyes!

18:53.332 --> 18:57.200
(James) Crikey, I can't even see Jezza already.
(Coughs)

18:57.269 --> 19:00.830
Oh, no, no, no, no!

19:02.474 --> 19:04.203
(Muffled exclamations)

19:04.276 --> 19:07.803
(Richard) Meanwhile,
in my unmodified Kadett...

19:07.880 --> 19:09.780
I'm gonna adjust my quarter light a bit.

19:09.848 --> 19:12.112
Just an inch. That's better.

19:12.184 --> 19:13.481
(Coughing)

19:14.920 --> 19:16.979
(Groaning, coughing)

19:17.789 --> 19:20.314
(Richard) I can feel the hate now.

19:20.392 --> 19:21.689
It's nice.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.751
(Groans) Me kakai's come off.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.160
(Coughs)

19:26.732 --> 19:28.324
Hello?

19:28.400 --> 19:33.167
(Jeremy) James and I made it through the dust
with our lives considerably shortened.

19:33.238 --> 19:34.865
(Coughs)

19:34.940 --> 19:37.033
(Jeremy) I've got consumption and TB.

19:37.109 --> 19:38.201
(Wheezes)

19:38.277 --> 19:40.768
I've got every single 1920s disease.

19:42.281 --> 19:44.681
And then Lord Smug piped up.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.308
I had to close this at one point.

19:46.385 --> 19:50.116
About that much, then it pulls the air out
and you get fresh air through. It's nice.

19:52.057 --> 19:55.026
(Jeremy) Know what it's like when
someone punches you really hard in the face?

19:55.093 --> 19:56.617
I do, actually.

19:56.695 --> 19:59.528
Then the surface got even worse.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.293
(Groans)

20:03.869 --> 20:07.396
It was like we were descending
through the seven circles of hell.

20:08.674 --> 20:10.608
(Trembling) Oh no!

20:19.818 --> 20:24.721
I'd assumed it'd be the salts that would
kill the notoriously rust-prone Lancia

20:24.790 --> 20:26.121
but it was the rough going.

20:26.191 --> 20:30.491
Even though it had now smoothed out again,
the Beta was in a bad way.

20:30.562 --> 20:32.962
- (Jeremy on radio) I've gone.
- Are you conkered out?

20:33.031 --> 20:37.661
- I've got no power, no drive.
- Do you remember what the man said, Jeremy?

20:37.736 --> 20:40.933
Break down and you will...
What is it? Have a nice time? No, die.

20:48.714 --> 20:52.206
Well that's loose, that's hot.

20:52.284 --> 20:54.479
(Engine revs, fails)

20:54.553 --> 20:58.922
It is a good job they canted this engine
over by 20 degrees cos that means

20:58.991 --> 21:02.722
it's more inaccessible than it would otherwise
have... Oh my God, look at this.

21:02.794 --> 21:06.355
- (Engine revs, fails)
- For God's sake.

21:13.205 --> 21:17.904
I gotta say it has been nice, the peace.
You know, not having him around.

21:17.976 --> 21:19.409
(Engine revs, fails)

21:20.212 --> 21:24.012
I've checked the alternator,
the spark plugs, the HT leads

21:24.082 --> 21:27.848
and the distributor cap,
poked around with the starter solenoid.

21:27.919 --> 21:31.411
There's been faults with all of them,
but it still isn't going.

21:31.490 --> 21:36.086
I'm not sure which I favor most here -
certain death or that Beetle.

21:45.604 --> 21:47.367
(Engine revs, fails)

21:47.439 --> 21:49.464
(Growls) Come off!

21:49.541 --> 21:50.565
(Blows)

21:50.642 --> 21:53.304
- (Engine fails)
- Oh, for God's sake.

21:56.214 --> 21:58.239
I honestly believe it's had it.

22:02.654 --> 22:07.057
- Is my car on the crab?
- No, it's tracking true, mate.

22:07.125 --> 22:09.252
He's worried about tracking and look at it.

22:10.629 --> 22:13.757
(Richard) We knew that Jeremy
would eventually catch us up,

22:13.832 --> 22:15.732
but what would he be driving?

22:18.303 --> 22:20.168
I can see something in the mirrors.

22:22.274 --> 22:25.641
- Please let it be a Beetle.
- I do hope it's a Beetle.

22:26.578 --> 22:30.344
(Richard) Please, please let it be a Beetle!
(James) Please let it be a Beetle.

22:35.153 --> 22:36.677
I'm back!

22:36.755 --> 22:39.519
Oh, Jeremy, well done. I'm disapp...
Sorry, delighted.

22:39.591 --> 22:41.525
(Richard) You're not in a Beetle!

22:41.593 --> 22:46.053
(Jeremy) Not a Beetle!
A fully-functioning Lancia Beta Coupé!

22:46.131 --> 22:50.295
(Richard) I just wanted the Beetle to pounce on
you when you were straying behind.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.996
I'm gutted.

22:52.070 --> 22:54.664
- Shall we just sandwich him, James?
- No!

22:56.274 --> 22:57.366
(Laughs)

23:08.754 --> 23:11.814
(Richard) With our convoy
back up to strength, we pressed on.

23:11.890 --> 23:14.882
Apart from Jeremy being Bill 0ddie occasionally.

23:14.960 --> 23:19.260
- This is where flamingos breed out here.
- So that's breeding, is it?

23:19.331 --> 23:22.858
- (James) It's a fossil.
- It's not, it only died about two years ago.

23:22.934 --> 23:25.801
- I was talking about you.
- (Richard) It's an ex-flamingo.

23:25.871 --> 23:27.338
- Look!
- (Richard) What now?

23:27.406 --> 23:29.806
I know what created this.

23:29.875 --> 23:31.775
- (Richard) Ostrich.
- Yes!

23:31.843 --> 23:35.643
(Jeremy) It's legs are miles apart.
(Richard) That's exactly how it was walking.

23:35.714 --> 23:39.206
(Jeremy) You know
David Attenborough's about to retire?

23:39.284 --> 23:44.517
Can I just say, you look like a gay cowboy
and you look like a gay terrorist.

23:44.589 --> 23:48.355
No, you look like a terrorist with a broken
windscreen wiper and your face is ridiculous.

23:48.427 --> 23:51.362
(Jeremy) Then Hammond
started to pick on my car.

23:51.430 --> 23:54.126
- Why haven't you turned it off?
- It's gathering electricity.

23:54.199 --> 23:56.861
So, if you turn it off
the battery's not going to start it again.

23:56.935 --> 24:00.928
- Turn it off and start it then.
- Yeah, go on. Turn it off and start it.

24:01.006 --> 24:03.304
(Richard) Let's have some beautiful silence.

24:03.375 --> 24:04.672
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

24:05.076 --> 24:07.374
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.209
(Engine stops)

24:09.281 --> 24:10.612
Behold.

24:10.682 --> 24:12.172
(Engine revs, fails)

24:12.250 --> 24:13.547
(Richard laughs)

24:14.352 --> 24:17.651
- Why did you turn it off?
- Because he said it would...

24:17.722 --> 24:21.123
- Good luck. Somebody'll give you a jump start.
- It'll be fi... Don't go away.

24:21.193 --> 24:22.251
Goodbye!

24:25.130 --> 24:28.497
(James) Annoyingly, Clarkson
got the Lancia going again,

24:28.567 --> 24:31.502
and then we came across some big birds.

24:39.478 --> 24:40.809
Wow!

24:42.481 --> 24:45.450
And then we saw even more wildlife.

24:45.517 --> 24:46.814
There's a cow.

24:47.986 --> 24:49.283
Two cows, three cows.

24:50.155 --> 24:51.144
Yes!

24:51.223 --> 24:53.191
We've done it!

24:53.258 --> 24:56.284
(Jeremy) We had crossed the Makgadikgadi.

24:56.361 --> 24:58.124
Trees!

24:58.196 --> 24:59.185
Life!

24:59.264 --> 25:04.896
Mate, did you ever think that you'd do that?
I'm genuinely proud of him. I am!

25:05.837 --> 25:12.242
Really, I'm startled that this... It isn't
a car any more, whatever it is, has done it,

25:12.310 --> 25:16.679
with its low-profile tires
and its low suspension that's broken.

25:16.748 --> 25:18.443
Personally, I'm absolutely delighted

25:18.517 --> 25:22.214
cos I think the Makgadikgadi is one
of the most unpleasant places I've ever been.

25:22.287 --> 25:25.256
It's just a big bowl of dust. Hello, mate.

25:27.759 --> 25:31.092
(Jeremy) Widow Twankey may have been
glad to see the back of the salt pans

25:31.162 --> 25:35.861
but despite this
they gave us a startling parting gift.

25:37.802 --> 25:39.064
(Gasping)

25:39.137 --> 25:42.300
(James) That is amazing.
(Richard) That's the moon?

25:42.374 --> 25:47.004
(Jeremy) Yeah, that's the moon.
Because of the dust from the pans you get...

25:47.078 --> 25:49.546
(Richard) A moonrise.
(James) An orange.

25:49.614 --> 25:51.275
(Richard) I've got goose bumps.

25:52.350 --> 25:55.183
(James) I know a Philip Larkin poem about
the moon. Would you like to hear it?

25:55.253 --> 25:56.311
(Richard) No.

26:00.792 --> 26:04.853
(Jeremy) As a new day dawned
our cars looked like wrecks.

26:04.930 --> 26:07.956
But their ordeal was far from over.

26:10.268 --> 26:15.865
Yes, we had crossed the salt pans, but we were
still only a third of the way across Botswana.

26:15.941 --> 26:19.502
And now,
we were about to enter the Kalahari.

26:27.352 --> 26:28.717
The Kalahari.

26:30.789 --> 26:33.883
Everyone who comes to the Kalahari
takes away a different memory of it:

26:33.959 --> 26:37.918
The savagery, the simplicity, the vast heat.

26:37.996 --> 26:39.793
Me, I think the bumpiness.

26:41.199 --> 26:42.860
It was as rough as hell,

26:42.934 --> 26:47.428
so we were glad when news came through
that we were to stop at the next village.

26:47.505 --> 26:50.372
(Traditional African singing)

26:59.951 --> 27:02.852
They seem to recognize a truly classy car.

27:06.424 --> 27:09.723
What could they possibly
have in mind for us here?

27:14.766 --> 27:16.825
It was another challenge.

27:16.901 --> 27:18.129
There you are.

27:20.805 --> 27:23.103
"Your cars have traveled far
and suffered much."

27:23.174 --> 27:24.266
(Richard) Yes, they have.

27:24.342 --> 27:27.368
"So we will now discover
how much performance they've lost

27:27.445 --> 27:31.939
"in a competition against the clock
on a rally special stage."

27:32.017 --> 27:34.679
Mine can't have lost any performance,
it never had any.

27:34.753 --> 27:36.516
- True.
- I'm not gonna ruin my Mercedes

27:36.588 --> 27:38.522
just for a few points.

27:38.590 --> 27:42.117
- You're right, you're not. You're not driving it.
- Well, who is?

27:42.193 --> 27:48.757
Some say he's seen
The Lion King 1,780 times

27:48.833 --> 27:53.202
and that his second best friend
is a cape buffalo.

27:53.271 --> 27:59.141
All we know is he's not The Stig,
but he is The Stig's African cousin!

28:03.748 --> 28:04.840
Wow!

28:11.556 --> 28:13.649
(Jeremy) He's protected the important bits.

28:16.027 --> 28:19.656
(Richard) Keen to get going,
the three of us fired up our engines.

28:22.600 --> 28:28.197
And we drove to African Stig's rally stage which
was in a dried-up river bed a few miles away.

28:28.273 --> 28:30.537
With packed spectator stands...

28:30.608 --> 28:31.700
(Mooing)

28:31.776 --> 28:32.834
...0liver went first.

28:32.911 --> 28:34.708
Three! Two!

28:34.779 --> 28:36.246
One!

28:36.314 --> 28:37.804
- Go!
- Start!

28:37.882 --> 28:39.645
(Jeremy) Three miles an hour.

28:39.718 --> 28:42.050
(Richard) You know when it was new
it had 40 horsepower?

28:42.120 --> 28:45.647
- If it's lost one a year it's at minus four.
- Minus four, yeah.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.386
(Jeremy) He's going round the first corner,
hold on.

28:50.328 --> 28:51.522
That was a power slide.

28:52.997 --> 28:55.022
(Richard) Look at that, it does look...

28:55.100 --> 28:58.092
(Jeremy) "Ridiculous"
is the word you're looking for.

28:59.304 --> 29:03.570
(Jeremy) As the Kadett struggled
to get up the hill, the spectators left.

29:03.641 --> 29:07.702
(Richard) It is having a... Come on,
joggle it, Stig's cousin. He's enjoying that.

29:07.779 --> 29:10.976
- And one minute, 12 seconds.
- Oh yes!

29:11.049 --> 29:13.540
That's a good benchmark
for you to try and beat.

29:14.185 --> 29:16.676
(James) Next up was the Panzer tank.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.417
- Most powerful, longest, best tires...
- Heaviest, slowest.

29:19.491 --> 29:20.856
What, longest?

29:20.925 --> 29:23.655
- Longest is good for rallying, is it?
- It is on this.

29:23.728 --> 29:27.323
So on loose-surface rallies
why don't they turn up with intercity trains?

29:27.398 --> 29:28.626
Go!

29:30.935 --> 29:33.733
(Jeremy) That's the most ridiculous
spectacle I've ever seen.

29:33.805 --> 29:37.866
A Mercedes with no bonnet,
no front wings, no doors.

29:37.942 --> 29:40.843
(James) In the hands of African Stig though,
it was flying.

29:40.912 --> 29:45.440
(James) That is the latest in a long line of
pedigree-lightened Mercedes-Benz sports cars.

29:45.517 --> 29:48.247
(Jeremy)
There's never been a Mercedes rally car.

29:49.487 --> 29:52.888
(Richard) Oh, yours is flying
up the hill, mate. Look at it go.

29:52.957 --> 29:55.892
You wait till you see,
the Lancia will dance through there.

29:57.562 --> 30:01.658
(James) Oh yes. Lovely.
(Richard) Oh! It's out of control there.

30:01.733 --> 30:03.428
(Jeremy) That's a big slide!

30:07.839 --> 30:11.002
- One minute, six.
- I'll just do my ancient...

30:11.075 --> 30:14.704
(Richard) I hate you gloating.
(Jeremy) Let him. It's like winning a semi final.

30:14.779 --> 30:17.577
(Jeremy) Time now to put James in his place

30:17.649 --> 30:22.052
because the Lancia was on home turf
with its rally pedigree.

30:22.120 --> 30:25.089
Stratos, 037... What?

30:28.426 --> 30:30.553
(Richard, laughing)
It's not dust, it's on fire!

30:30.628 --> 30:32.619
- Shut it down. Can you turn it off?
- (Laughter)

30:35.733 --> 30:37.360
(Richard) Look at it all!

30:39.404 --> 30:42.396
(James) Stopwatch still running. 45 seconds.

30:43.208 --> 30:49.443
We'll replace the seal and then when it's cooled
down a bit he'll be able to do the lap.

30:49.514 --> 30:51.709
You'll have difficulty though. He's off.

30:53.384 --> 30:55.716
Maybe he's started. Start the stopwatch.

30:55.787 --> 30:57.516
I think he was in a hurry

30:57.589 --> 30:59.614
- so he decided not to take your car.
- Jeremy.

30:59.691 --> 31:02.319
- What?
- You're right, though. Your engine, it's canted.

31:04.562 --> 31:08.020
(James) The next day, in the center of Maun,
we got our next challenge.

31:08.099 --> 31:10.624
- This is it.
- Ah, the glittering golden envelope.

31:10.702 --> 31:15.969
"You will drive your cars to Namibia
through the Okavango Delta."

31:16.040 --> 31:18.201
That's the really big wildlife place.

31:18.276 --> 31:21.074
"In the Okavango
you will encounter many deadly animals

31:21.145 --> 31:24.137
"including lions, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas,

31:24.215 --> 31:27.514
"wild dogs, hippos,
black rhino and crocodile,

31:27.585 --> 31:31.578
"bird snakes, shield-nose snakes,
puff adders,

31:31.656 --> 31:34.887
"boomslang, cape cobras, banded cobras,

31:34.959 --> 31:38.258
"black mambas, black widows
and thick-tailed scorpions."

31:39.564 --> 31:41.725
- What about the honey badger?
- The what?

31:41.799 --> 31:44.632
That's the least scary-sounding
animal in the world.

31:44.702 --> 31:46.533
A honey badger does not kill you to eat you,

31:46.604 --> 31:49.038
it tears off... your testicles.

31:49.107 --> 31:51.905
- It does not!
- Why's it called a honey badger?

31:51.976 --> 31:55.810
- Cos that's what's made it angry.
- Why isn't it called the badger of death?

31:55.880 --> 31:59.008
(James) In order to protect ourselves
from the lions and the honey badgers,

31:59.083 --> 32:02.575
Jeremy and I would have to rebuild our cars.

32:02.654 --> 32:05.680
But because we'd left all the bits
on the other side of the salt pans,

32:05.757 --> 32:08.453
we had to use whatever we could find.

32:08.526 --> 32:11.086
Could a lion eat this? Grrr!

32:11.162 --> 32:14.825
Who do I see about the corrugated metal?

32:14.899 --> 32:17.891
Suppose I better practice, at least,
my lion drill.

32:17.969 --> 32:20.699
Oh no! There's a lion coming! Ah!
What shall I...

32:20.772 --> 32:23.332
That. Oliver will protect me.

32:29.113 --> 32:32.082
(Jeremy) Because Mercedes
were very popular in Africa,

32:32.150 --> 32:36.917
James soon found a spare door
and boot lid for his car.

32:40.491 --> 32:44.655
And while he was looking for more bits,
I hatched a plan.

32:45.496 --> 32:47.464
Look what I've got.

32:47.532 --> 32:49.762
- That's a cow's head.
- Yeah.

32:50.435 --> 32:53.734
Now, this will attract flies
which will make his life unpleasant.

32:53.805 --> 32:57.138
- Yes.
- It will also attract lions, tigers...

32:57.208 --> 33:01.008
He effectively becomes
a burger van driving through.

33:01.079 --> 33:03.479
(Richard) And to make sure
the lions didn't miss...

33:03.548 --> 33:06.176
- Oh, yeah! That's a whopper!
- That's a good piece.

33:09.187 --> 33:11.178
Oh, yeah, under the seat.

33:11.255 --> 33:13.917
- And the smell...
- Oh! The smell will be beautiful.

33:15.259 --> 33:18.717
(Richard) We also attached a cowbell
to the underside of his car.

33:18.796 --> 33:22.357
But while we were doing this,
he was making merry with the paint.

33:26.270 --> 33:30.798
That afternoon we left Maun
and headed north to the 0kavango Delta.

33:33.644 --> 33:38.013
Right. My car now has been readied.
As you can see, I have a wooden door here.

33:38.082 --> 33:41.483
It's a gull-wing,
so I can get in and out, obviously.

33:43.588 --> 33:45.988
God, this is like being in an allotment shed.

33:47.558 --> 33:49.458
On a very windy day.

33:49.560 --> 33:53.394
On the left I have all the cans
that were in the car for the last few days,

33:53.464 --> 33:56.194
they've been arranged.
And the piece de résistance...

33:56.267 --> 33:58.201
- (Feedback)
- Badgers, go away.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.439
I am the road warrior.

34:08.946 --> 34:10.004
Mad Jeremy.

34:10.081 --> 34:11.309
(Car siren)

34:12.350 --> 34:13.873
It's a police car.

34:21.726 --> 34:24.695
Can anybody else smell burning
or is it my car?

34:24.762 --> 34:26.559
Is it like a barbecue smell?

34:29.033 --> 34:33.129
(James) As we went through the gates and into
the game reserve, the road changed again.

34:33.204 --> 34:34.967
For the worse.

34:35.039 --> 34:37.234
This is new. Very soft sand.

34:39.944 --> 34:43.812
To stop our cars bogging down
we had to drive as fast as possible.

34:44.949 --> 34:48.009
We had ourselves another rally stage.

34:48.085 --> 34:50.918
(All groan)

34:52.690 --> 34:56.683
Amazingly, even Jeremy had his work cut out
keeping up with the 0pel.

34:58.963 --> 35:00.760
Hammond's car just looks so composed.

35:00.832 --> 35:05.428
I'm developing this irrational hatred
of him and it.

35:06.137 --> 35:08.332
Ho-ho! This is such a good game!

35:09.073 --> 35:14.773
(Jeremy) Eventually he was slowed down
by a bridge... over the river Kwai.

35:14.846 --> 35:16.814
(Whistles Colonel Bogey March)

35:17.949 --> 35:22.886
The rally stage had taken its toll
on one of the cars. Take a guess which one.

35:22.954 --> 35:27.414
I'm in a car which, as you can probably hear,
has got a throttle that's jammed wide open

35:27.492 --> 35:29.050
and I can't hold it on the brakes.

35:29.127 --> 35:32.563
Hammond, move!
You're gonna have to go fast when I hit you.

35:32.630 --> 35:34.825
- What?
- (Smashing)

35:34.899 --> 35:37.834
- Oh, God!
- Thanks! Well, help yourself to my brakes!

35:37.902 --> 35:39.927
- Why not?
- I've lost a skull.

35:40.004 --> 35:40.993
Monkeys.

35:41.072 --> 35:43.199
- (Jeremy) I'm sorry, I can't...
- (Smashing)

35:43.274 --> 35:44.332
(Bleep)

35:44.408 --> 35:46.171
- Whoa!
- (Tires screech)

35:47.812 --> 35:51.009
Just hear the throttle. That's tick-over.
Look, my leg's not on it.

35:53.651 --> 35:57.917
Having bodged my throttle,
we headed deeper into the 0kavango.

36:00.825 --> 36:04.022
(James) Front, twelve o'clock... One o'clock.

36:04.095 --> 36:05.926
This is where wildlife cameramen

36:05.997 --> 36:08.864
come to make a name for themselves
with David Attenborough.

36:08.933 --> 36:13.336
But, unfortunately,
our film crew are best really with cars.

36:13.404 --> 36:15.338
(James) A giraffe on the right.

36:15.406 --> 36:17.465
There. The big thing.

36:19.877 --> 36:24.576
If we ever do a program called The Back End
Of An Animal, these are the boys to hire.

36:24.649 --> 36:26.640
This week on Too Late To Look...

36:26.717 --> 36:30.209
Baboon on the left with animals,
with a baby on its back.

36:30.288 --> 36:32.916
To give our crew a chance we stopped,

36:32.990 --> 36:36.289
and discovered that we weren't
much good at animals either.

36:37.161 --> 36:39.186
- Wow! Look! Look!
- Where?

36:39.263 --> 36:42.494
- A hippo's head.
- (James) It's probably a whole hippo.

36:42.567 --> 36:44.125
The rest of him's under the water.

36:45.703 --> 36:48.297
What does a hippo do
just before it's about to attack?

36:48.372 --> 36:50.033
Opens its mouth.

36:50.107 --> 36:53.508
It can open its jaw...
there's a thing it can do.

36:53.578 --> 36:56.775
(James) Oh, look!
(Richard) Aw! Look at that.

36:56.847 --> 37:03.150
(Jeremy) They stop for a drink, using their noses
to shovel water into their mouths.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.348
(Richard) Jeremy,
that's a rubbish commentary.

37:05.423 --> 37:06.890
(Richard) James took over.

37:06.958 --> 37:10.155
(James) That one's lifting its paw up
a bit like a dog does.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.492
- (Jeremy) Paw!
- Hoof, foot, whatever you call it.

37:12.563 --> 37:14.463
- (Richard) Hoof?
- What is it on an elephant?

37:14.532 --> 37:15.965
(James) It's amazing.

37:16.033 --> 37:20.629
There's a man over there with the best
combover I have ever seen in my life.

37:22.673 --> 37:23.765
(James) That is...

37:25.910 --> 37:29.505
He's got four partings as a result of that,
can you see?

37:29.580 --> 37:32.344
Why don't...
"You're bald, live with it."

37:32.416 --> 37:34.941
(Jeremy)
Oops, he caught me looking at him.

37:36.287 --> 37:40.849
- I was looking through binoculars.
- I was looking at the elephants, really, I was.

37:41.492 --> 37:43.983
(Jeremy) Look at that sun now, boys.

37:44.061 --> 37:46.052
Elephants, rally special stage,

37:46.130 --> 37:48.758
- best combover I've ever seen.
- Everything's here.

38:02.446 --> 38:07.509
(Richard) We camped by the river and
while James serviced his car I hatched a plan.

38:07.585 --> 38:11.282
- Jeremy. Jeremy. Jeremy!
- What?

38:11.355 --> 38:13.255
Quick, come here. Come here.

38:13.324 --> 38:15.121
It's the cow's head.

38:15.192 --> 38:17.717
It wasn't working in the boot
but I've had a better idea.

38:17.795 --> 38:18.819
- What?
- Tent.

38:18.896 --> 38:19.920
- His tent?
- Yeah.

38:19.997 --> 38:21.123
Love your thinking.

38:21.198 --> 38:24.497
(Richard) It's the second one
from the right. You find it. That's it.

38:27.471 --> 38:29.803
- (Jeremy) Put it under his bed.
- (Animal grunts)

38:29.874 --> 38:31.842
- Shh!
- What?

38:31.909 --> 38:33.900
- What was that?
- That was a hippo.

38:33.978 --> 38:36.674
- (Splashing)
- What?

38:36.747 --> 38:38.942
Clarkson...

38:39.016 --> 38:41.177
There's a very big hippo.

38:41.252 --> 38:43.686
Oh my... Look at that.

38:43.754 --> 38:48.316
Hippos spend all day in the water
and then they come out at night because...

38:48.392 --> 38:50.189
I can't remember why.

38:50.261 --> 38:51.990
Well, thank you. That's useful.

38:52.063 --> 38:53.155
What's that?

38:54.465 --> 38:55.762
Oh, brilliant!

38:55.833 --> 39:01.362
Look, do you wanna go out there
with a hippopotamus?

39:01.439 --> 39:03.771
Or do you want to stay in here
with a horse's head?

39:03.841 --> 39:06.969
- That's not a question that's ever been asked.
- It's not a horse either, it's a cow!

39:07.044 --> 39:13.449
Erm, hang on. That's my bag in James'...
This is my tent!

39:14.151 --> 39:15.743
Oh man! Get it out!

39:18.856 --> 39:23.486
(Jeremy) 0ur starting point at the Zimbabwe
border felt like it was in another time zone.

39:23.561 --> 39:26.655
But still there were
many miles of delta to cover,

39:26.731 --> 39:29.962
and our cars were in a really bad way.

39:31.402 --> 39:33.962
The bush mechanic we have on the team

39:34.038 --> 39:38.065
took two cubic feet of sand
out of my carburetor last night

39:38.142 --> 39:41.839
and asked if I wouldn't mind
driving a little bit more slowly today.

39:41.912 --> 39:43.402
(Cowbell jangles)

39:43.481 --> 39:45.574
(Giggles) James' cowbell!

39:47.685 --> 39:52.554
0ur ordinary, second-hand road cars were
getting more and more out of their depth.

39:52.623 --> 39:55.091
(Jeremy) This is proper off-roading now.

39:55.993 --> 40:00.862
Men in camouflage trousers in Wales
who like murdering people at weekends

40:00.931 --> 40:02.489
would say this was tough-going.

40:02.566 --> 40:03.897
It was a whole...

40:03.968 --> 40:05.697
- (Crashing)
- Oh!

40:05.770 --> 40:08.398
- What is it? It's like iron.
- (Jeremy) It's a tree root.

40:08.472 --> 40:10.872
I think I've bent my steering rack a bit.

40:12.676 --> 40:14.109
Wow!

40:16.046 --> 40:18.640
(James) Wow, there is an elephant right there.

40:19.216 --> 40:21.116
Got my door down.

40:21.952 --> 40:23.977
Cos that would stop an elephant.

40:26.056 --> 40:28.217
(James) Soon our route
was blocked by a river

40:28.292 --> 40:31.750
and what you're supposed to do
is wade in to check the depth.

40:33.297 --> 40:34.696
Right.

40:34.765 --> 40:38.531
(Jeremy) James went first
and I said I'd watch for crocodiles.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.463
I say, there's a ground-hornbill over there.

40:42.540 --> 40:44.007
It's getting deeper!

40:44.074 --> 40:47.237
- (Jeremy) Ooh! Hang on a minute!
- Permission to say cock.

40:48.078 --> 40:49.602
It's coming in!

40:50.848 --> 40:52.873
Thunderbird One to the rescue!

40:52.950 --> 40:55.282
(James on radio)
Come on, I'm sinking by the bows.

40:55.352 --> 40:56.842
Coming.

40:59.457 --> 41:04.053
- Aargh! No! I can't help you!
- Come on!

41:04.128 --> 41:08.758
- James, I'm in a low-slung sports car!
- I'm going down!

41:10.835 --> 41:15.067
- That's good. Yes!
- I've got water coming into my car!

41:16.941 --> 41:20.001
Oh, I've got a wet bottom!

41:20.077 --> 41:22.136
We're through!

41:23.447 --> 41:28.407
(Jeremy) Both our cars were flooded
but our guides weren't bothered at all.

41:28.486 --> 41:32.115
People of Surrey, if this happens to you,
you get water in the foot well

41:32.189 --> 41:34.214
and you need to drain it out,
you need a hole,

41:34.291 --> 41:36.885
well, the people of Botswana
have a tip for you.

41:49.707 --> 41:54.110
(Richard) Meanwhile, using patience,
I'd found a proper crossing point.

41:55.679 --> 42:00.582
There is a technique to fording rivers,
even on a proper ford like this.

42:00.651 --> 42:03.643
You've gotta keep enough speed up
so you push a bow wave like that

42:03.721 --> 42:07.817
then you use whatever power you've got
in the engine. Come on, come on, come on.

42:07.892 --> 42:09.860
Oh my! No!

42:11.862 --> 42:13.489
Oh God!

42:15.266 --> 42:18.531
He stalled! He's going down!

42:18.602 --> 42:20.536
I can't open the door!

42:23.007 --> 42:24.269
Oh God!

42:31.448 --> 42:32.574
(Groans)

42:34.218 --> 42:36.413
Please! Come out!

42:36.487 --> 42:38.921
Come on! Float! Float!

42:38.989 --> 42:40.547
Float!

42:40.624 --> 42:42.489
Oliver!

42:44.495 --> 42:46.087
Hammond, how's it going?

42:46.931 --> 42:48.956
Well, I got a bit of water in him.

42:49.033 --> 42:52.264
We did as well,
but it doesn't matter cos we used the rifles,

42:52.336 --> 42:55.897
we shot the cars and the water's
all drained out. It's brilliant.

42:55.973 --> 42:57.406
Good.

42:58.342 --> 43:00.242
I might need the rifle.

43:01.979 --> 43:06.507
As a local tourist truck pulled me out,
the laughing hyenas arrived.

43:07.484 --> 43:08.917
(Both laugh)

43:11.088 --> 43:13.056
May gave his diagnosis.

43:13.958 --> 43:17.223
Starting from the top,
the battery's probably pretty knackered

43:17.294 --> 43:20.092
- and then the carburetor will be flooded.
- Mm, very.

43:20.164 --> 43:23.600
Then working down, the distributor cap,
that'll be full of water.

43:23.667 --> 43:28.195
The engine itself, if water went into the
cylinders you might have compressed it.

43:28.272 --> 43:30.968
- The oil will be ruined...
- I know all this. I can fix him.

43:31.041 --> 43:34.204
- You are going to try and mend this?
- If you'd leave me to it, yeah.

43:34.278 --> 43:36.075
(Jeremy) So we did.

43:36.146 --> 43:38.273
(Sentimental music on radio)

43:47.658 --> 43:51.458
Oh, that's harsh.
That is quite harsh but go on.

43:51.528 --> 43:53.086
(# REM: Everybody Hurts)

43:58.402 --> 44:00.097
Oh, you'll like this one.

44:00.170 --> 44:01.694
♪ It's sad

44:01.772 --> 44:03.672
♪ So sad

44:03.741 --> 44:07.404
♪ It's a sad, sad situation...

44:07.478 --> 44:08.740
(Cowbell jangles)

44:10.147 --> 44:13.605
(Jeremy) Unfortunately,
you can only give a man so much sympathy,

44:13.684 --> 44:16.676
so James and I went ahead to make camp.

44:20.591 --> 44:24.925
Hammond knew that in the morning,
if his beloved 0liver wasn't fixed,

44:24.995 --> 44:26.724
he'd have to leave him behind.

44:26.797 --> 44:30.062
So he got our bush mechanic
to bring the generator down...

44:32.503 --> 44:34.266
and worked on through the night.

44:46.116 --> 44:49.244
Morning came,
and still no Hammond.

44:49.319 --> 44:50.843
I'm knackered today.

44:52.022 --> 44:54.286
I mean, I'm feeling quite like an explorer.

44:54.358 --> 44:55.723
(Approaching engine)

44:57.294 --> 45:01.162
- That Hammond?
- Is it a Beetle, more to the point?

45:09.273 --> 45:10.433
No way.

45:14.411 --> 45:15.969
- (Richard laughs)
- No way.

45:16.046 --> 45:18.776
Oh yeah! Yeah, he's back.

45:20.084 --> 45:21.142
Ah!

45:23.153 --> 45:27.146
And here's the best thing. Remember the horn
which was rubbish? (Clears throat)

45:27.224 --> 45:28.248
(Horn sounds clearly)

45:28.325 --> 45:29.519
It's excellent.

45:30.861 --> 45:33.591
- (Sighs)
- Is that technically possible?

45:33.664 --> 45:34.858
Probably not.

45:35.632 --> 45:38.100
47 years, I've never been speechless.

45:41.238 --> 45:43.570
(Jeremy) With all the cars defying all the odds,

45:43.640 --> 45:46.200
we began our final push to the border.

45:48.879 --> 45:52.406
- (James) My car is working perfectly, as usual.
- (Cowbell jangles)

45:52.483 --> 45:55.111
I've got no brakes,
the pedal goes straight to the floor

45:55.185 --> 45:59.622
and I have to declutch to stop so I just tread
on my own foot, so I'm using the handbrake.

45:59.690 --> 46:01.658
(Jeremy) Hal The Lancia could beat that.

46:01.725 --> 46:07.186
Every time I brake it spears off to the right
and I'm unable to steer left to correct that.

46:07.264 --> 46:11.724
This has now gone from being a nuisance
to being downright dangerous.

46:13.237 --> 46:15.569
(James) We soon reached the end
of the 0kavango,

46:15.639 --> 46:18.267
so we pulled over
to remove the animal protection.

46:18.342 --> 46:20.367
And then, guess what?

46:20.444 --> 46:23.902
The Lancia simply would not get going again.

46:23.981 --> 46:27.439
It now won't start because the starter
solenoid's chosen this moment to pack up,

46:27.518 --> 46:31.750
but when it was running
it wouldn't move off in any of the gears.

46:31.822 --> 46:34.188
It was just that last 60K,

46:34.258 --> 46:37.125
it had that feel of a car that was dying.

46:37.194 --> 46:40.425
(Jeremy) Richard actually sympathized
because he'd been there.

46:40.497 --> 46:42.124
As for James?

46:42.199 --> 46:43.496
(Under cough) Beetle!

46:46.236 --> 46:48.397
I'm not gonna give up. I'll push it.

46:50.507 --> 46:52.941
Is this a good time to acknowledge
that mine is the only one

46:53.010 --> 46:54.807
- that has worked consistently?
- No.

46:57.881 --> 47:00.441
This is worrying.
I need to be home by Saturday.

47:00.517 --> 47:02.348
I've been invited to a Beetle drive.

47:03.520 --> 47:06.683
(Jeremy) The entire crew
was working on the stricken Beta.

47:06.757 --> 47:10.625
Until we were rewarded
with the most glorious sound in the world.

47:10.694 --> 47:12.753
- (Engine starts)
- Life.

47:12.830 --> 47:16.288
It lives! It lives!

47:16.366 --> 47:19.199
I got a whole hundred yards.

47:20.437 --> 47:22.371
Oh, not stuck!

47:22.439 --> 47:24.339
My idle speed's not good.

47:26.076 --> 47:28.203
Bye, everybody! I can't stop!

47:28.278 --> 47:30.803
Please! Please!

47:31.882 --> 47:36.285
(Richard) Soon, we hit the tarmac
and we started to taste the hope.

47:41.992 --> 47:44.893
Just 20 miles, you can do that,
you've crossed Botswana.

47:44.962 --> 47:47.795
Now I'm stuck in second
but second will do.

47:48.265 --> 47:53.430
Obviously, mine would keep going to the other
side of the whole continent but, you know.

47:53.503 --> 47:55.494
Come on, ten miles, please!

47:57.174 --> 48:00.905
(Richard)
Then something really surprising happened.

48:00.978 --> 48:02.172
Oh no, not now.

48:03.580 --> 48:04.638
Please!

48:05.749 --> 48:10.413
(Jeremy) Because the Lancia had been such
a problem child everyone was fed up with it.

48:10.487 --> 48:13.718
0nly two of the crew stayed behind to help.

48:13.790 --> 48:18.659
Carburetor's gone. Even if we can
get that fixed, the starter motor is gone.

48:18.729 --> 48:23.530
We've put it into gear, it goes into third. That
stalls the engine and you're back to square one.

48:24.668 --> 48:27.796
(James) The border was just five miles away.

48:27.871 --> 48:30.999
(James) This is an object lesson
for the owners of old cars everywhere.

48:31.074 --> 48:34.134
- You can drive 'em round the world.
- Yeah, it's really relaxing.

48:34.211 --> 48:36.042
- (Engine revs, fails)
- Come on.

48:36.113 --> 48:37.444
(Engine revs, fails)

48:37.514 --> 48:39.106
(Richard) Border!

48:40.050 --> 48:46.979
1,596 kilometers. That's near as dammit
a thousand miles, I've still got half a car left

48:47.057 --> 48:48.354
and very bad hair.

48:50.661 --> 48:53.459
(Laughs) I don't believe that.

48:55.399 --> 48:56.593
- (Tires skid)
- (Crashing)

48:56.667 --> 48:58.259
Sorry!

48:58.335 --> 48:59.495
I've got no brakes.

48:59.569 --> 49:01.560
(Both laugh)

49:01.638 --> 49:02.730
I've... Yeah.

49:03.874 --> 49:05.603
(# Verdi: La donna e mobile)

49:05.676 --> 49:06.836
It's there.

49:08.011 --> 49:09.239
We've done it!

49:11.448 --> 49:13.609
(Richard) All we had to do now was wait.

49:13.684 --> 49:16.448
Wait to see which car Jeremy arrived in.

49:18.188 --> 49:20.349
- Is that an engine?
- That's a car.

49:22.826 --> 49:26.284
(Richard) Unmistakable
clatter of an air-cooled engine.

49:26.363 --> 49:27.921
It's gonna be the Beetle.

49:28.932 --> 49:30.422
(Jeremy) And it was.

49:34.838 --> 49:36.430
But I wasn't driving it.

49:36.506 --> 49:37.734
(Cheers)

49:39.476 --> 49:41.501
- I'm almost pleased!
- Yes!

49:43.613 --> 49:45.410
(James) Oh, that's excellent.

49:46.583 --> 49:49.916
Watch it! Brakes don't work!
Sorry, there's no brakes.

49:49.987 --> 49:52.820
(James) Congratulations.
(Richard) That's astonishing!

49:55.592 --> 49:59.585
I think, realistically,
we have to say the Lancia's won it.

49:59.663 --> 50:02.496
- Why? By what possible measure?
- Erm... No.

50:02.566 --> 50:05.160
- It's the most surprising.
- It's the worst.

50:05.235 --> 50:08.568
Well, you don't buy a second-hand car
to be surprised that it still works.

50:08.638 --> 50:12.074
- It had to be rebuilt once a day.
- But... You're right. It's rubbish.

50:12.876 --> 50:15.640
- Mercedes is the best car.
- What?

50:15.712 --> 50:18.647
- What have I had to do? I've had to...
- Take the entire body off!

50:18.715 --> 50:20.478
It's a showroom model, James.

50:20.550 --> 50:24.782
I admit that it's not entirely original
but in mechanical terms it was perfect.

50:24.855 --> 50:26.254
You cannot break that...

50:26.323 --> 50:28.951
I think, honestly,
we have to be magnanimous here

50:29.026 --> 50:32.462
because only one of the cars
has actually made it unmodified.
