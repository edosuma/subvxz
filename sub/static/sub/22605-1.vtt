00:13.974 --> 00:16.308
(prayer continues in distance)

00:20.113 --> 00:22.582
- (door bangs)
- MAN: Call the American embassy.

00:22.583 --> 00:25.452
(speaking Arabic)

00:25.453 --> 00:27.354
<i>Call the State Department.</i>

00:27.355 --> 00:29.189
You can't do this.

00:29.190 --> 00:30.957
You know, we have rights.

00:30.958 --> 00:33.625
- Call the American embassy.
- (men shouting in Arabic)

00:37.097 --> 00:38.935
I don't understand... what'd he say?

00:38.936 --> 00:43.735
He said, "Don't be a fool.
You're gonna die here."

00:51.411 --> 00:53.346
- Dr. McCord.
- Yeah.

00:53.347 --> 00:55.348
Hey, can I talk to you about my thesis?

00:55.349 --> 00:57.684
Uh, sure... during office hours.

00:57.685 --> 00:59.452
Yeah, your office hours
don't really work for me.

00:59.453 --> 01:00.920
(laughs) Sorry to hear that.

01:00.921 --> 01:03.690
Thing is, I don't really want
to write about the Cold War.

01:03.691 --> 01:05.592
You're aware that the class is called

01:05.593 --> 01:07.694
"Postwar Politics and the Cold War."

01:07.695 --> 01:10.263
Yeah, but I feel like it's been done.

01:10.264 --> 01:13.333
That's why they call it history, Jake.

01:13.334 --> 01:15.835
Thing is, my theory is that

01:15.836 --> 01:17.770
we are living through a new cold war.

01:17.771 --> 01:19.806
All right, compare and
contrast to the original

01:19.807 --> 01:21.040
and convince me.

01:21.041 --> 01:23.137
Great. Also, I'll need
an extension. My parents

01:23.138 --> 01:25.211
are coming to town and
they're very needy.

01:25.212 --> 01:26.512
Oh. My husband bought tickets

01:26.513 --> 01:27.947
to the opera this weekend.

01:27.948 --> 01:30.049
I mean, normally, I love the
opera, but I got to tell you,

01:30.050 --> 01:31.851
it's been a hell of a week,
and the thought of sitting

01:31.852 --> 01:33.553
in a dimly lit room with a bunch of people

01:33.554 --> 01:35.488
singing at me in Italian...

01:35.489 --> 01:37.490
it's just gonna make me fall asleep.

01:37.491 --> 01:38.825
I'm so sorry.

01:38.826 --> 01:41.627
I thought we were telling
each other our problems.

01:41.628 --> 01:43.029
No extension.

01:43.030 --> 01:44.925
Enjoy your parents.

01:44.926 --> 01:46.260
MAN: <i>What Aquinas was trying to say</i>

01:46.261 --> 01:48.528
in <i> Summa Theologica</i> is that existence

01:48.529 --> 01:51.031
and essence are separate things, right?

01:51.032 --> 01:53.900
That's the whole notion behind
Catholic transubstantiation.

01:53.901 --> 01:55.802
Now, Luther though a Thomist

01:55.803 --> 01:57.304
by definition, departed from him

01:57.305 --> 01:58.422
- in significant ways.
- Honey?

01:58.423 --> 02:00.091
Their eyes are glazing over.

02:00.092 --> 02:02.776
They're just listening to
you 'cause you're so cute.

02:02.777 --> 02:04.244
GIRL: No way.

02:04.245 --> 02:06.246
I hated religion before I took his class.

02:06.247 --> 02:07.881
Now I'm totally caught up.

02:07.882 --> 02:09.082
He's brilliant.

02:09.083 --> 02:12.319
Wow. Well, do you mind if I just

02:12.320 --> 02:14.087
steal his brilliance for a minute?

02:14.088 --> 02:15.854
Yeah, sure.

02:17.290 --> 02:19.593
So, how am I supposed to
develop a cult following?

02:19.594 --> 02:21.372
Oh, I think you'll figure it out.

02:21.373 --> 02:23.964
Hey, listen. Did you remember
you got to cook tonight?

02:23.965 --> 02:25.131
'Cause I'm going into DC.

02:25.132 --> 02:26.493
- Right, the spy reunion.
- Yes.

02:26.494 --> 02:29.202
And since I'm the only one
who can talk about work,

02:29.203 --> 02:30.270
I get to be

02:30.271 --> 02:31.638
the center of attention.

02:31.639 --> 02:33.506
You're always the center
of attention with me.

02:33.507 --> 02:36.074
Really? Tell that
to your cult following.

02:36.776 --> 02:39.011
WOMAN: <i>You wouldn't recognize the CIA.</i>

02:39.012 --> 02:41.414
George is the only one
on a Middle East desk right now.

02:41.415 --> 02:42.649
MAN: Libya.

02:42.650 --> 02:44.818
Lebanon. I'm staring at screens

02:44.819 --> 02:46.619
of abandoned factories and oil wells,

02:46.620 --> 02:49.422
listening to chatter
about the World Cup.

02:49.423 --> 02:51.124
I mean, they could at least have

02:51.125 --> 02:52.612
pastured me somewhere interesting.

02:52.613 --> 02:55.828
- He loves that desk job.
- They didn't pasture you.

02:55.829 --> 02:57.096
They just didn't feel like

02:57.097 --> 02:58.765
risking your life
in the field anymore.

02:58.766 --> 02:59.932
You bought their story?

02:59.933 --> 03:02.101
There was no evidence
that my cover was blown.

03:02.102 --> 03:03.136
He never looks back.

03:03.137 --> 03:04.437
And you guys should talk.

03:04.438 --> 03:05.705
They both got Africa.

03:05.706 --> 03:06.739
Do you know how volatile

03:06.740 --> 03:07.707
- that place is gonna be?
- Yes!

03:07.708 --> 03:08.708
That is like the disco

03:08.709 --> 03:10.042
of global hot spots.

03:10.043 --> 03:11.511
- Oh, yeah.
- Why don't you call

03:11.512 --> 03:12.912
our, uh, former boss and complain

03:12.913 --> 03:14.280
to him about your desk job?

03:14.281 --> 03:16.716
- Oh, I did.
- George!

03:16.717 --> 03:19.318
- You called POTUS about your desk job?
- I... I...

03:19.319 --> 03:21.254
I gave it a shot, okay? I mean, he ran

03:21.255 --> 03:22.655
the place for 12 years, I figured

03:22.656 --> 03:24.557
he's still invested in personnel, so...

03:24.558 --> 03:26.025
He never called back.

03:26.026 --> 03:27.303
Imagine that.

03:27.304 --> 03:28.761
How is the, uh, bucolic life going?

03:28.762 --> 03:30.162
It's great.

03:30.163 --> 03:31.964
We're teachers.

03:31.965 --> 03:33.232
We're parents.

03:33.233 --> 03:34.652
We're horse owners.

03:34.653 --> 03:36.035
- Mmm.
- Ooh! Oh, my!

03:36.036 --> 03:37.636
And every morning we wake up,

03:37.637 --> 03:40.406
- that's all we got to be.
- (phones buzzing)

03:40.407 --> 03:41.639
That's a shock.

03:45.144 --> 03:47.679
Well, this can't be good.

03:49.782 --> 03:51.750
The, uh, Secretary of State's plane

03:51.751 --> 03:54.018
just went down over the Atlantic.

03:56.281 --> 03:57.259
HENRY: <i>Hey!</i>

03:57.260 --> 03:58.657
I thought we said no
gadgets at the table.

03:58.658 --> 03:59.925
ELIZABETH: We did.

03:59.926 --> 04:01.867
And then the kids
never came to the table.

04:01.868 --> 04:04.229
Besides, it's Saturday.

04:04.230 --> 04:05.230
Oh, yay!

04:05.231 --> 04:07.232
No Rules Saturday?

04:07.233 --> 04:09.001
REPORTER: Vincent Marsh,
of course, began...

04:09.002 --> 04:10.235
- Hey!
- Dad, can you turn it off?

04:10.236 --> 04:13.038
What? My screen is
competing with your screens?

04:13.039 --> 04:15.908
<i>Repeating what we know so far...</i>

04:15.909 --> 04:18.744
the Secretary of State Vincent
Marsh's plane disappeared

04:18.745 --> 04:20.345
<i>off the coast of Florida.</i>

04:20.346 --> 04:23.582
He was headed to Caracas, Venezuela.

04:23.583 --> 04:25.184
Mom, do you think it was terrorism?

04:25.185 --> 04:26.985
No.

04:26.986 --> 04:28.723
I think people shouldn't
fly in small planes.

04:28.724 --> 04:30.422
Still, why was he going to Venezuela?

04:30.423 --> 04:32.399
- Is that a resort destination?
- JASON: Exactly.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.102
When will you guys acknowledge
the obvious conspiracy around us

04:35.103 --> 04:36.561
- at all times?
- Seriously?

04:36.562 --> 04:38.363
You had to wind up the anarchist?

04:38.364 --> 04:39.831
Sorry.

04:39.832 --> 04:42.132
(horse snorts)

04:45.864 --> 04:47.806
I thought you were gonna do
something relaxing today.

04:47.807 --> 04:49.841
Well, this relaxes me.

04:49.842 --> 04:51.042
Oh, uh, your phone.

04:51.043 --> 04:52.778
It wouldn't stop ringing,
so I answered it.

04:52.779 --> 04:54.279
Well, who is it?

04:54.280 --> 04:56.414
Some lady says it's the
president's office.

04:56.415 --> 04:57.782
PTA?

04:57.783 --> 04:59.184
The United States.

04:59.185 --> 05:01.419
Well, that's a prank. Hang it up.

05:01.420 --> 05:03.421
Just take it. She sounds serious.

05:03.422 --> 05:05.722

05:44.196 --> 05:47.165
It's a bad time to be without
diplomatic representation.

05:47.166 --> 05:49.492
Because of the peace talks with Iran

05:49.493 --> 05:51.569
and President Shiraz's
upcoming visit to the U.S.?

05:51.570 --> 05:53.471
So you understand why I can't

05:53.472 --> 05:55.940
waste any time on this decision.

05:55.941 --> 05:57.508
I want you to step in.

05:57.509 --> 05:58.776
Step into what?

05:58.777 --> 06:00.077
Secretary of State.

06:00.078 --> 06:01.979
(laughs)

06:01.980 --> 06:03.681
Y... (laughs)

06:03.682 --> 06:04.882
You're joking.

06:04.883 --> 06:06.751
Um, I don't mean

06:06.752 --> 06:10.254
you're joking, but you can't be serious.

06:10.255 --> 06:12.223
Obviously you're serious, I just...

06:12.224 --> 06:13.858
Why?

06:13.859 --> 06:16.494
I recruited you for the CIA.

06:16.495 --> 06:18.162
I trained you as an analyst.

06:18.163 --> 06:20.631
I know how you think, how you work.

06:20.632 --> 06:22.899
I trust you.

06:30.541 --> 06:31.809
Give us a minute, will you?

06:31.810 --> 06:35.078
SECRET SERVICE AGENT: Yes, Mr. President.

06:37.515 --> 06:38.816
I wanted to nominate you

06:38.817 --> 06:41.185
right after I was elected. I was talked

06:41.186 --> 06:42.953
out of my choice by...

06:42.954 --> 06:45.222
well-meaning advisers.

06:45.223 --> 06:48.759
Vincent Marsh was
always running for office.

06:48.760 --> 06:50.327
You have no such ambition.

06:50.328 --> 06:53.731
You quit a profession you
love for ethical reasons.

06:53.732 --> 06:56.500
That makes you the least
political person I know.

06:56.501 --> 06:58.669
You don't just think outside the box.

06:58.670 --> 07:00.371
You don't even know there is a box.

07:00.372 --> 07:03.105
(quiet laugh)

07:10.314 --> 07:13.183
I believe I can effect
real change in the world.

07:13.184 --> 07:15.484
I want you to help me do that.

07:16.353 --> 07:18.988
I know you won't let me down.

07:22.326 --> 07:23.894
I realize you'll need some time

07:23.895 --> 07:25.729
to discuss this with your family.

07:25.730 --> 07:28.063
I'll give you the rest of the day.

Madam Secretary, you'll be across from him.

08:05.895 --> 08:09.183
I've charted out all ten of his
wives by their names and ranks.

08:09.184 --> 08:10.951
Basically, it's a seniority system.

08:10.952 --> 08:13.187
You look like you have a question.

Um...

Yes.

08:16.858 --> 08:18.525

The chart?

08:19.928 --> 08:21.395
The dinner.

Why are we entertaining
the King of Swaziland?

It was important to him.

WOMAN: The press loves stuff like this.

08:29.904 --> 08:31.505
The guy's flamboyant, exotic.

08:31.506 --> 08:33.039
Polygamist.

08:33.041 --> 08:34.842
- We're not using that word.
- We're not?

08:34.842 --> 08:35.876
What are we calling it?

08:35.876 --> 08:36.909
It falls under

08:36.910 --> 08:38.245
cultural diversity.

08:38.246 --> 08:40.011
I see.

08:42.256 --> 08:43.899
Well, is it important
to have all the wives?

08:43.900 --> 08:46.330
You think maybe we could've
cut it off at say three?

08:46.954 --> 08:48.476
How much is this costing, Nadine?

08:48.477 --> 08:50.444
You want me to get you
the figures on that?

08:50.445 --> 08:52.259
Yes. And also

08:52.260 --> 08:55.327
the updated information on the
AIDS epidemic in that country.

08:56.296 --> 08:58.231
Madam Secretary? It's
the Czech Ambassador.

08:58.232 --> 08:59.433
He says it's urgent.

08:59.434 --> 09:00.734
What could be urgent over there?

09:00.735 --> 09:01.968
Guess we'll find out.

Oh, I think that one goes to 11.

09:15.349 --> 09:16.383
They all hate me as much?

09:16.384 --> 09:18.918
No. It's a mixture.

09:18.919 --> 09:19.953
Why don't you hate me?

09:19.954 --> 09:21.321
Because you hired me.

09:21.322 --> 09:22.389
And you're awesome.

09:22.390 --> 09:24.357
I might have inadvertently reversed those.

09:24.358 --> 09:26.199

09:26.200 --> 09:26.893
Probably.

09:26.894 --> 09:28.561

their boss had just died.

09:45.412 --> 09:47.345
Hello, Pavel.

09:51.584 --> 09:55.520
(men shouting in Arabic nearby)

09:57.190 --> 09:58.491
(man pleading in Arabic)

09:58.492 --> 09:59.659
Stay away from the door!

09:59.660 --> 10:01.260
(grunting)

10:01.261 --> 10:03.229
(guard yelling in Arabic)

10:03.230 --> 10:05.098
(man pleading in Arabic)

10:05.099 --> 10:07.667
(guard shouts in Arabic)
(bangs bars)

10:07.668 --> 10:08.935
(metallic clattering)

10:08.936 --> 10:10.703
What are they gonna do...
kill that guy?!

10:10.704 --> 10:11.771
Sit down!

10:11.772 --> 10:13.172
Don't draw attention.

10:13.173 --> 10:15.141
(blows landing, man screaming)

10:15.142 --> 10:17.176
(man shouting in Arabic)

10:17.177 --> 10:20.337
ELIZABETH: <i> Two American kids
arrested and imprisoned</i>

10:20.338 --> 10:23.740
in Syria for attempting
to join Fatah ash-Sham.

10:23.741 --> 10:25.013
Ethan and Tyler Cole,

10:25.014 --> 10:26.869
brothers from Hartford, Connecticut.

10:26.870 --> 10:29.451
They have an activist Web site
called "One Free Earth,"

10:29.452 --> 10:32.385
the basic gist of which
is "war bad, peace good."

10:32.386 --> 10:34.789
So they join a jihadist group
to drive home this point.

10:34.790 --> 10:36.891
Ash-Sham isn't a jihadist group.

10:36.892 --> 10:38.426
It has jihadist elements,

10:38.427 --> 10:40.995
but their immediate goal is to overthrow

10:40.996 --> 10:43.131
the Syrian government,
which I think we can all agree,

10:43.132 --> 10:45.100
isn't a paradigm of virtue.

10:45.101 --> 10:46.334
I stand corrected.

10:46.335 --> 10:48.303
These kids are peace-loving
freedom fighters.

10:48.304 --> 10:49.938
ELIZABETH: They're using Facebook

10:49.939 --> 10:52.073
and Instagram to demonstrate poverty

10:52.074 --> 10:53.573
and poor treatment of women.

10:54.509 --> 10:55.777
Doesn't make them geniuses,

10:55.778 --> 10:57.745
but it certainly doesn't
make them jihadists.

10:57.746 --> 10:59.280
Where does this come from?

10:59.281 --> 11:00.715
(sighs)

11:00.716 --> 11:02.016
From the Czech ambassador.

11:02.017 --> 11:04.385
That's how we communicate
with Syria these days.

11:04.386 --> 11:06.688
Any idea what the Syrians
think they're up to?

11:06.689 --> 11:10.224
President Nussir's completely
opposed to Shiraz's visit

11:10.225 --> 11:11.459
to the U.S.

11:11.460 --> 11:13.042
He sees it as a threat to his authority.

11:13.043 --> 11:15.096
The Syrians want to prove
that they still have teeth.

11:15.097 --> 11:17.500
So they grab two hapless kids
and throw them in prison?

11:17.501 --> 11:18.258
How does that help?

11:18.259 --> 11:19.800
They're always detaining some Westerner

11:19.801 --> 11:21.135
who had no business being there.

11:21.136 --> 11:23.304
What's the urgency?

11:23.305 --> 11:25.673
They're gonna execute
those kids in a week.

11:25.674 --> 11:27.173
Oh...

11:29.877 --> 11:31.145
(sighs)
Has it hit the news cycle?

11:31.146 --> 11:32.280
ELIZABETH: No.

11:32.281 --> 11:34.348
We're just learning of it ourselves.

11:34.349 --> 11:35.883
What do you recommend?

11:35.884 --> 11:37.752
I know some people on the ground.

11:37.753 --> 11:39.420
I'd like to proceed
through back channels

11:39.421 --> 11:40.231
at this point.

11:40.232 --> 11:42.523
- What do you mean, "back channels"?
- Not an official op.

11:42.524 --> 11:44.492
I think it's safer and faster

11:44.493 --> 11:46.393
just to work with the people I know.

11:46.394 --> 11:48.928
Trouble is, I don't know
the people you know.

11:49.463 --> 11:51.332
No, we have to do it my way.

11:51.333 --> 11:53.433
Keep it within The Company.

11:54.668 --> 11:56.036
All right.

11:56.037 --> 11:57.151
I'll get in touch with the parents

11:57.152 --> 11:59.073
and stress the importance
of non-communication.

11:59.074 --> 12:00.174
Good.

12:00.175 --> 12:02.642
I think we're done here.

12:05.112 --> 12:07.080
JACKSON: We got you the name

12:07.081 --> 12:10.484
of a stylist, right?

12:10.485 --> 12:11.852
A stylist?

12:11.853 --> 12:14.221
You're going to find it useful.

12:14.222 --> 12:16.123
It's a tough transition.

12:16.124 --> 12:18.425
I-I really don't think it's necessary.

12:18.426 --> 12:20.327
It's coming from the top.

12:20.328 --> 12:22.162
Conrad...?

12:22.163 --> 12:24.164
The president wants me to have a stylist?

12:24.165 --> 12:25.632
As chief of staff, when I speak,

12:25.633 --> 12:28.302
I am generally speaking for the president.

12:28.303 --> 12:29.703
Image is a big part of the job.

12:29.704 --> 12:31.038
Don't take it personally.

12:31.039 --> 12:33.145
You know, actually, as long
as we're on the subject...

12:33.146 --> 12:34.608
somewhat... of speaking to the president,

12:34.609 --> 12:37.044
I'd like to brief him on
the Syrian kidnapping.

12:37.045 --> 12:38.445
No.

12:38.446 --> 12:39.613
It's premature.

12:39.614 --> 12:40.712
It's a volatile situation.

12:40.713 --> 12:42.349
I don't want him being caught off guard

12:42.350 --> 12:43.483
if it hits the press.

12:43.484 --> 12:44.750
It's not going to hit the press,

12:44.751 --> 12:46.720
'cause I'm telling you
to make sure it doesn't.

12:46.721 --> 12:48.989
I'll do my best.

12:48.990 --> 12:50.223
I know you have

12:50.224 --> 12:51.992
a friendship with the president.

12:51.993 --> 12:53.126
But you're in a system now.

12:53.127 --> 12:54.828
Trying to take advantage of that

12:54.829 --> 12:56.229
would be ill-advised.

12:56.230 --> 12:57.964
How would I take advantage of that?

12:57.965 --> 13:00.532
By going around me.

13:12.460 --> 13:15.201
WOMAN (voice wavering): <i> Tyler...</i>
<i>he's, uh, the ambitious one.</i>

13:15.202 --> 13:17.037
He has this idea he's going

13:17.038 --> 13:19.171
to change the world with his blog.

13:19.172 --> 13:20.839
He majored in Arabic studies.

13:20.840 --> 13:23.309
He speaks Farsi and Arabic, fluently.

13:23.310 --> 13:24.643
He's a brilliant kid.

13:24.644 --> 13:26.311
I can't believe he's stupid enough

13:26.312 --> 13:27.579
to pull a stunt like this.

13:27.580 --> 13:29.915
So I assume you tried to talk them out of

13:29.916 --> 13:31.083
making this trip?

13:31.084 --> 13:32.584
We didn't even know about it.

13:32.585 --> 13:35.020
See, we were sending Ethan
to Europe for graduation,

13:35.021 --> 13:36.384
he asked Tyler to go with him.

13:36.385 --> 13:38.624
I mean, we knew they
would go as far as Turkey,

13:38.625 --> 13:40.559
but we had no idea
they'd cross into Syria.

13:40.560 --> 13:41.960
Ethan's not political at all.

13:41.961 --> 13:44.763
He wants to play music
and pick up girls.

13:44.764 --> 13:45.797
Tyler talked him into this.

13:45.798 --> 13:47.966
It doesn't matter whose fault it is.

13:47.967 --> 13:50.092
So, then, there's no reason to believe

13:50.093 --> 13:51.536
that they were somehow trying to join

13:51.537 --> 13:52.638
the Syrian opposition movement?

13:52.639 --> 13:55.173
No. Absolutely not.

13:55.174 --> 13:57.142
Neither one of them
knows how to mow a lawn,

13:57.143 --> 13:59.544
let alone... handle a weapon.

13:59.545 --> 14:00.612
They're idealists.

14:00.613 --> 14:02.180
It should be easy enough to explain.

14:02.181 --> 14:03.415
And tensions are easing up

14:03.416 --> 14:05.383
in that part of the world, right?

14:05.384 --> 14:06.618
Not in Syria.

14:06.619 --> 14:07.619
I mean, we have to go

14:07.620 --> 14:09.521
through a third party.

14:09.522 --> 14:11.289
If the State Department
is gonna take this on,

14:11.290 --> 14:12.190
it's gonna have to be

14:12.191 --> 14:13.625
- completely undercover.
- If?

14:13.626 --> 14:15.760
It has to go up the chain of command.

14:15.761 --> 14:17.896
So far, I've been given the green light

14:17.897 --> 14:19.231
to pursue a negotiation.

14:19.232 --> 14:21.766
But if anything were
to get out in the press,

14:21.767 --> 14:24.202
it would greatly jeopardize our efforts.

14:24.203 --> 14:25.637
But you're gonna have to work with us.

14:25.638 --> 14:26.671
We need to take down

14:26.672 --> 14:28.406
their blog, their Facebook page,

14:28.407 --> 14:29.541
and we need to ask

14:29.542 --> 14:31.643
that you have no communication

14:31.644 --> 14:33.078
through social media yourselves.

14:33.079 --> 14:34.787
But how-how do we take their pages down?

14:34.788 --> 14:36.881
- We don't even have the passwords.
- We can handle that.

14:36.882 --> 14:39.184
- You're asking us to go underground?
- ELIZABETH: Yes.

14:39.185 --> 14:41.553
And trust you with our children's lives.

14:41.554 --> 14:43.188
That's right.

14:43.189 --> 14:47.192
But... but isn't there
a power to speaking out?

14:47.193 --> 14:49.761
Mr. Cole, free speech has landed us

14:49.762 --> 14:51.663
where we find ourselves right now.

14:51.664 --> 14:54.599
It's a constitutionally protected right,

14:54.600 --> 14:56.200
not a global one.

14:56.201 --> 14:57.468
As your sons are finding out

14:57.469 --> 14:58.569
the hard way.

14:58.570 --> 15:00.504
Oh, God...

15:03.174 --> 15:05.508
I have two teenagers.

15:06.644 --> 15:08.112
They're smart,

15:08.113 --> 15:09.947
self-confident and articulate,

15:09.948 --> 15:11.315
as we've raised them to be.

15:11.316 --> 15:14.619
My son is a self-proclaimed anarchist.

15:14.620 --> 15:15.853
(laughs)

15:15.854 --> 15:19.757
I could see him doing
something like this.

15:19.758 --> 15:21.492
And if it were my son

15:21.493 --> 15:23.594
where Tyler and Ethan are today?

15:23.595 --> 15:25.929
This is how I would handle it.

15:30.201 --> 15:32.435
Okay.

15:33.904 --> 15:35.439
Okay.

15:35.440 --> 15:36.907
JASON: The kids are all
either preppy nerds

15:36.908 --> 15:38.909
who already have their rooms
at Harvard and Yale picked out

15:38.910 --> 15:40.478
or these athletes who are
too dumb to breathe.

15:40.479 --> 15:42.213
- HENRY: That's pretty dumb.
- ELIZABETH: Not to mention

15:42.214 --> 15:43.414
a bad situation for an athlete.

15:43.415 --> 15:44.749
Yeah, well, fortunately,

15:44.750 --> 15:47.251
the teachers are completely
unimaginative rule-followers

15:47.252 --> 15:49.019
who are totally threatened
by original thought.

15:49.020 --> 15:50.721
ELIZABETH: Okay.

15:50.722 --> 15:52.122
Let's play a game called

15:52.123 --> 15:53.991
"name one positive thing
about your school."

15:53.992 --> 15:56.727
There are, uh, three hot girls.

15:56.728 --> 15:57.828
HENRY: Dude, that's three things.

15:57.829 --> 15:59.396
I feel better already.

15:59.397 --> 16:00.598
You know, I seem to remember

16:00.599 --> 16:02.399
that you hated your former school, too.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.034
Yeah, but for totally different reasons.

16:04.035 --> 16:05.269
HENRY: Such is the lonely

16:05.270 --> 16:06.534
journey of the anarchist.

16:06.535 --> 16:09.306
- I'm not complaining.
- ELIZABETH: And yet it sounds

16:09.307 --> 16:10.941
exactly like complaining.

16:10.942 --> 16:11.975
What about you?

16:11.976 --> 16:13.944
Everything's fine.

16:13.945 --> 16:15.546
- Come on.
- Do you want to hear

16:15.547 --> 16:17.481
the details of me missing my boyfriend?

16:17.482 --> 16:18.515
Ooh! I vote no.

16:18.516 --> 16:19.994
ELIZABETH: What about your classes?

16:19.995 --> 16:21.418
You remember how excited you were

16:21.419 --> 16:23.420
about that French literature class?

16:23.421 --> 16:25.255
It's fine. Can I be excused?

16:25.256 --> 16:26.889
HENRY: Yes.

16:29.426 --> 16:31.127
Did you want to hear more of that?

16:32.362 --> 16:33.753
Maybe I should go talk to her.

16:33.754 --> 16:35.198
Just give her some space.

16:35.199 --> 16:37.533
Okay.

16:40.804 --> 16:41.938
Or not.

16:41.939 --> 16:43.940
ELIZABETH: <i>Did we do the right thing?</i>

16:43.941 --> 16:46.476
We absolutely did the right thing.

16:46.477 --> 16:48.410
What are we talking about?

16:50.046 --> 16:51.681
This. The job. The move.

16:51.682 --> 16:53.850
Yes.

16:53.851 --> 16:54.918
The kids will adjust.

16:54.919 --> 16:56.352
It's only been two months.

16:57.287 --> 16:59.122
And you're sure that
I didn't push us into this?

16:59.123 --> 17:00.190
No.

17:00.191 --> 17:02.626
Jason is thrilled to
be living even closer

17:02.627 --> 17:04.160
to the dark halls of conspiracy.

17:04.161 --> 17:05.060
Ali hated living

17:05.061 --> 17:06.363
on a horse farm.

17:06.364 --> 17:08.798
Okay, and now she misses her boyfriend.

17:08.799 --> 17:10.934
Yeah. If we were home,
she'd be dramatically upset

17:10.935 --> 17:12.301
about something else. She's 15.

17:12.303 --> 17:13.569
Do you hear what you just did?

17:13.570 --> 17:15.339
You just called it "home."

17:15.339 --> 17:16.178
That place.

17:16.179 --> 17:17.452
Where we used to live.

17:17.453 --> 17:18.875
Honey, it's gonna take some time

17:18.876 --> 17:21.209
before it stops feeling like home.

17:22.579 --> 17:24.948
And... are you really
happy at Georgetown?

17:24.949 --> 17:27.650
Are you kidding me? I love Georgetown.

17:27.651 --> 17:30.150
Being a religion professor
at a Jesuit university?

17:30.151 --> 17:31.921
It's like being a Beatle. (snorts)

17:31.922 --> 17:33.389
So we're fine?

17:33.390 --> 17:34.290
We're fine.

17:34.291 --> 17:35.558
Totally fine?

17:35.559 --> 17:37.025
Totally fine.

17:39.529 --> 17:41.229
We used to have sex more often.

17:43.333 --> 17:44.667
We had sex this weekend.

17:44.668 --> 17:47.170
But we used to have weeknight sex.

17:47.171 --> 17:48.371
Stop overthinking things.

17:48.372 --> 17:49.739
Is it my masculine energy?

17:49.740 --> 17:51.808
I've got too much of it?
Because I know some men,

17:51.809 --> 17:54.410
they're turned off by
women in positions of power.

17:54.411 --> 17:57.280
I totally love

17:57.281 --> 17:58.548
women in power positions.

17:58.549 --> 17:59.982
Huh?

17:59.983 --> 18:02.452
I'm completely attracted

18:02.453 --> 18:04.119
to your masculine energy.

18:05.054 --> 18:06.789
Tell me what to say.

18:06.790 --> 18:09.924
(phone buzzing)

18:11.861 --> 18:13.562
What is it?

18:13.563 --> 18:15.698
It's an encoded text.

18:15.699 --> 18:17.199
Oh, it's from George.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.634
Saying what?

18:18.635 --> 18:21.502
He's outside.

18:31.781 --> 18:32.902
Come inside.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.604
I can't. Your place is probably bugged.

18:34.605 --> 18:36.452
George, they sweep it every day.

18:36.453 --> 18:37.620
Come on.

18:37.621 --> 18:39.954
(breathing heavily)

18:42.124 --> 18:44.126
How'd you get by my security detail?

18:44.127 --> 18:46.895
I know those guys.

18:46.896 --> 18:49.098
I gave the detail leader his first job.

18:49.099 --> 18:50.499
Well, that's unsettling.

18:50.500 --> 18:51.700
Humor me, will you?

18:51.701 --> 18:54.069
I'm taking my life in my hands here,

18:54.070 --> 18:56.238
and you're the only person I can trust.

18:56.239 --> 18:58.874
You look terrible.

18:58.875 --> 19:00.676
Have you even slept?

19:00.677 --> 19:02.977
Listen to me.

19:03.812 --> 19:06.381
Vincent Marsh's plane crash

19:06.382 --> 19:07.649
was not an accident.

19:07.650 --> 19:10.118
I have reason to believe

19:10.119 --> 19:12.387
that someone inside had it arranged.

19:12.388 --> 19:13.589
Inside what?

19:13.590 --> 19:15.524
The Company.

19:15.525 --> 19:18.458
Marsh had some operation
going in Venezuela.

19:18.869 --> 19:21.828
Money laundering, drugs,
arms dealing... something.

19:21.829 --> 19:23.327
But the guy was dirty.

19:23.328 --> 19:24.828
What's the evidence, George?

19:25.864 --> 19:28.133
I decoded some of his
personal correspondence

19:28.134 --> 19:30.369
and uncovered a bank account in Caracas.

19:30.370 --> 19:33.505
He was on his way to meet someone.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.341
Do you know what happens
when that gets out?

19:35.342 --> 19:37.276
That someone inside the White House

19:37.277 --> 19:39.644
has gone completely off the grid?

19:42.782 --> 19:44.282
You think I'm nuts.

19:45.451 --> 19:47.520
It's just a lot...
it's a lot to process, George.

19:47.521 --> 19:48.721
That's all.

19:48.722 --> 19:50.256
HENRY: Hey, buddy.

19:50.257 --> 19:51.457
Everything okay?

19:51.458 --> 19:52.958
Hank.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.525
Where'd you come from?

19:55.561 --> 19:57.096
The bedroom. I live here.

19:57.097 --> 19:59.130
Oh.

19:59.131 --> 20:02.532
Do you want to come
in and have a drink?

20:03.235 --> 20:05.337
I'm sorry.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.437
(sighs)

20:06.438 --> 20:08.740
Boy, I shouldn't have come.

20:08.741 --> 20:11.110
This... this didn't happen.

20:11.111 --> 20:12.411
Understood?

20:12.412 --> 20:14.712
What didn't happen?

20:19.818 --> 20:22.153
Be careful, Bess.

20:49.449 --> 20:50.873
MATT: Who's she in there with?

20:50.874 --> 20:52.408
Oh, I'm not at liberty to say.

20:52.409 --> 20:53.809
Well, I got a tip from security.

20:53.810 --> 20:54.910
It's the Director of the CIA.

20:54.911 --> 20:56.745
Can't confirm or deny.

20:56.746 --> 20:57.746
Uh, just so you know?

20:57.747 --> 20:58.981
There's a tradition of sharing

20:58.982 --> 21:00.416
information in the outer office.

21:00.417 --> 21:01.550
Oh.

21:01.551 --> 21:03.185
Well, (clears throat)
in that case,

21:03.186 --> 21:04.386
I heard you guys tongued

21:04.387 --> 21:06.189
in the supply closet
at the Christmas party,

21:06.190 --> 21:07.676
and it's been a little
awkward ever since

21:07.677 --> 21:09.127
because you're both with other people.

21:09.128 --> 21:11.293
MATT: Look, is she going to fire us?

21:11.294 --> 21:13.195
Because I need to get
my résumé in order.

21:13.196 --> 21:15.164
Blake? I'm Roxanne Majidi.

21:15.165 --> 21:16.765
I have an appointment with the secretary.

21:16.766 --> 21:18.167
BLAKE: The secretary is busy.

21:18.168 --> 21:21.503
Hey, why don't we all take a seat

21:21.504 --> 21:23.471
and think our private thoughts.

21:25.040 --> 21:27.276
MUNSEY: <i>The prison holding the two boys</i>

21:27.277 --> 21:29.144
is located 20 miles outside of Damascus

21:29.145 --> 21:30.245
in a rural area.

21:30.246 --> 21:32.614
Mostly abandoned warehouses and farms.

21:32.615 --> 21:34.616
But our team on the ground
made a positive I.D.

21:34.617 --> 21:36.385
They're working with people inside.

21:36.386 --> 21:37.419
How big is the team?

21:37.420 --> 21:39.354
Four guys, special ops.

21:39.355 --> 21:41.256
The prison is low security.

21:41.257 --> 21:42.491
One helo, in and out,

21:42.492 --> 21:44.326
under cover of darkness,
clean and simple.

21:44.327 --> 21:46.328
Barring unanticipated complications.

21:46.329 --> 21:48.997
Yeah, barring those.

21:48.998 --> 21:50.899
And there's no reason

21:50.900 --> 21:53.301
to think that these kids are somehow CIA?

21:53.302 --> 21:54.369
Absolutely not.

21:54.370 --> 21:55.720
We haven't flagged them anywhere.

21:55.721 --> 21:57.231
And the FBI says they haven't either.

21:57.232 --> 21:59.841
All right.

21:59.842 --> 22:02.677
The chief of staff has
told me I can sign off.

22:02.678 --> 22:05.313
So, this is the official go-ahead.

22:05.314 --> 22:06.615
(exhales loudly)

22:06.616 --> 22:08.183
Alert me two hours out.

22:08.184 --> 22:10.752
Yes, ma'am.

22:10.753 --> 22:13.255
How's George doing by the
way with the new desk job?

22:13.256 --> 22:14.923
He's a good analyst.

22:14.924 --> 22:16.891
A little high-strung, but
I think he'll settle in.

22:16.892 --> 22:18.526
Good.

22:18.527 --> 22:20.462
He's doing good work.

22:20.463 --> 22:22.197
He just needs to take a breath.

22:22.198 --> 22:24.265
He's not really a breather.

22:24.266 --> 22:26.167
That is an understatement.

22:26.168 --> 22:27.669
Hey, listen to me.

22:27.670 --> 22:29.471
If there is any reason at all

22:29.472 --> 22:32.240
to pull the plug on this op, do it.

22:32.241 --> 22:34.405
We can't afford a Black
Hawk Down moment.

22:34.406 --> 22:35.599
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

22:35.600 --> 22:36.546
- Madam Secretary?
- Yeah?

22:36.547 --> 22:38.881
This is Roxanne Majidi, the
newest addition to our staff.

22:38.882 --> 22:40.982
I see. In what capacity?

22:40.983 --> 22:42.350
I was sent by the chief of staff.

22:42.351 --> 22:43.451
Mr. Jackson says I'm to be

22:43.452 --> 22:44.886
your personal appearance specialist.

22:44.887 --> 22:47.755
Okay, I have no idea what that means.

22:47.756 --> 22:49.156
Your stylist.

22:49.991 --> 22:51.359
Oh. (laughs)

22:51.360 --> 22:53.094
Well, I-I'm sure that you're

22:53.095 --> 22:54.495
very good at what you do.

22:54.496 --> 22:56.964
But, um, I don't need a stylist.

22:56.965 --> 22:58.066
Madam Secretary,

22:58.067 --> 22:59.734
I just do as I'm told.

22:59.735 --> 23:01.903
But I was sent by the chief of staff.

23:01.904 --> 23:03.504
He was pretty insistent.

23:03.505 --> 23:05.072
The way he conveyed it to me,

23:05.073 --> 23:07.909
you don't have a choice in the matter.

23:07.910 --> 23:10.645
See, here's the problem.

23:10.646 --> 23:12.817
I've never met a situation

23:12.818 --> 23:14.482
where I don't have a
choice in the matter.

23:14.483 --> 23:15.983
- Well...
- You know, why don't we find

23:15.984 --> 23:17.385
another time for you to swing by?

23:17.386 --> 23:18.822
It's a very busy day here.
Uh, why don't

23:18.823 --> 23:20.688
you grab your stuff and, uh,
we'll be able to talk...

23:20.689 --> 23:21.889
Madam Secretary?

23:21.890 --> 23:23.491
We need to review your statement

23:23.492 --> 23:24.825
about the King of Swaziland visit.

23:24.826 --> 23:26.127
- Okay.
- Yeah.

23:26.128 --> 23:27.862
I have a rough first draft.

23:27.863 --> 23:29.630
I'm still working on the adjectives.

23:29.631 --> 23:31.325
Right now, you're "happy" and "excited."

23:31.326 --> 23:32.488
You need to work on the adjectives.

23:32.489 --> 23:33.934
Well, I have to get
something to the press

23:33.935 --> 23:35.302
- by tomorrow.
- Can I be "resigned"

23:35.303 --> 23:36.390
and "conflicted"?

23:36.391 --> 23:38.105
You can never be either of those things.

23:38.106 --> 23:39.473
You can be "eager" and "optimistic."

23:39.474 --> 23:41.442
No, she can't be eager.
That's too Jimmy Carter.

23:41.443 --> 23:42.943
Can I be "cautiously optimistic"?

23:42.944 --> 23:44.853
Well, that's for more
serious world events.

23:44.854 --> 23:46.583
- You can be "forward-thinking."
- You know what?

23:46.584 --> 23:48.341
- I'll do the writing, thanks.
- Can we maybe just

23:48.342 --> 23:50.985
throw in something of substance here?

23:50.986 --> 23:53.420
Maybe a reference to
global health issues

23:53.421 --> 23:55.656
- or developing economies?
- Yeah, I just don't

23:55.657 --> 23:58.425
think now is a good time for substance.

23:58.426 --> 23:59.560
Okay.

23:59.561 --> 24:01.628
What if I'm grateful

24:01.629 --> 24:03.731
for the opportunity to expose the world

24:03.732 --> 24:06.734
to a variety of cultural differences

24:06.735 --> 24:09.069
as we move toward a more

24:09.070 --> 24:12.238
global-thinking society?

24:14.007 --> 24:15.175
That's really good.

24:15.176 --> 24:16.577
Should I write it down for you?

24:16.578 --> 24:18.478
- No, I'm the writer. I...
- Just as long

24:18.479 --> 24:19.879
as our roles are clear.

24:21.481 --> 24:22.816
You got to stop doing that, okay?

24:22.817 --> 24:24.797
Because it's my job, it's not yours...

24:28.155 --> 24:30.956
- Thanks...
- Madam Secretary?

24:31.792 --> 24:34.661
We have a problem.

24:34.662 --> 24:37.164
It has to do with Operation Stupid Kids.

24:37.165 --> 24:38.898
Is that really what we're calling it?

24:38.899 --> 24:40.033
That's what we were calling it.

24:40.034 --> 24:41.301
Before it went bust.

24:41.302 --> 24:43.083
Now we're calling it
Operation Never Happened.

24:43.084 --> 24:45.038
The Intel on the prison
location was bad,

24:45.039 --> 24:47.338
and when the special forces made
their way inside the structure,

24:47.339 --> 24:48.441
they found goats.

24:48.442 --> 24:49.976
Is that code for something?

24:49.977 --> 24:51.912
No, ma'am. Actual goats.

24:51.913 --> 24:53.446
It was disinformation.

24:53.447 --> 24:55.081
The good news is that
there were no casualties

24:55.082 --> 24:56.917
and no goats were harmed.

24:56.918 --> 25:00.020
It's just not helpful.

25:00.021 --> 25:02.969
I was supposed to be
alerted two hours out.

25:02.970 --> 25:04.235
What the hell just happened?

25:04.236 --> 25:06.493
Apparently they saw a window.
They felt they had to move.

25:06.494 --> 25:09.496
That is not the CIA director's call.

25:09.497 --> 25:11.798
Blake? Where the hell is he anyway?

25:11.799 --> 25:14.200
Mr. Munsey is busy cleaning
up the mess on the ground.

25:14.201 --> 25:16.236
Yeah, well, that is nothing compared

25:16.237 --> 25:18.384
to the mess he's gonna
have to clean up with me.

25:18.385 --> 25:19.938
NADINE: And this just came in.

25:21.274 --> 25:23.610
We are American spies

25:23.611 --> 25:26.112
captured and rightfully

25:26.113 --> 25:28.815
imprisoned in Damascus.

25:28.816 --> 25:32.218
Our objective was to
overthrow the government.

25:32.219 --> 25:33.453
We intend to commit

25:33.454 --> 25:35.922
acts of terrorism against
the Syrian people.

25:35.923 --> 25:37.557
When did this come in?

25:37.558 --> 25:39.225
About an hour ago.

25:39.226 --> 25:42.795
It was sent as an encoded
e-mail directly to our office.

25:42.796 --> 25:44.630
Unfortunately, it comes on the heels

25:44.631 --> 25:47.400
of our unsuccessful attempt
to liberate the prisoners.

25:47.401 --> 25:48.668
JACKSON: How unsuccessful?

25:48.669 --> 25:50.937
Well, we were given
disinformation on the location.

25:50.938 --> 25:53.406
Nothing disastrous, but now
they have some leverage.

25:53.407 --> 25:54.861
And this is obviously their next move.

25:54.862 --> 25:56.576
What do they want?

25:56.577 --> 25:57.777
Engagement for now.

25:57.778 --> 26:00.513
Ultimately, they want us
to call off the peace talks.

26:00.514 --> 26:01.824
What if we don't respond?

26:01.825 --> 26:03.749
They'll release the video.
This thing goes viral,

26:03.750 --> 26:05.898
it's on the first hour of
every morning talk show

26:05.899 --> 26:08.821
with compare-and-contrast
profiles to the Boston bombers.

26:08.822 --> 26:10.723
Not the worst outcome I could imagine.

26:10.724 --> 26:13.326
No, I agree. That's the
best case scenario.

26:13.327 --> 26:15.382
Worst case, nobody buys
the phony confession

26:15.383 --> 26:16.593
and then the world has to stop

26:16.594 --> 26:18.200
while we negotiate their release.

26:18.201 --> 26:20.099
That's why we have to
act now under the radar

26:20.100 --> 26:21.234
while we still have some latitude.

26:21.235 --> 26:23.002
Your failed attempt
wasn't under the radar?

26:23.003 --> 26:24.837
Excuse me, that was your
failed attempt as well.

26:24.838 --> 26:26.972
Nobody's placing blame.

26:26.973 --> 26:29.575
Sir, this is not how I would've

26:29.576 --> 26:30.972
proceeded left to my own devices.

26:30.973 --> 26:32.700
An official op... it's
got too many moving parts.

26:32.701 --> 26:34.346
There's too many things
that can go wrong.

26:34.347 --> 26:36.148
We need to take direct action.

26:36.149 --> 26:37.950
How direct?

26:37.951 --> 26:39.551
Just me and the guy
that can get it done.

26:39.552 --> 26:40.853
A guy I can't really ask about.

26:40.854 --> 26:42.588
Yes, sir.

26:42.589 --> 26:43.789
That kind of guy.

26:43.790 --> 26:46.371
Sir, we can't afford
to get involved in this.

26:46.372 --> 26:47.826
Not on the eve of Shiraz's visit

26:47.827 --> 26:50.062
and the most important
peace talks in recent memory.

26:50.063 --> 26:51.196
We're already involved.

26:51.197 --> 26:53.432
Keep it at bay.

26:53.433 --> 26:55.734
Let the Syrians know we're
gonna disavow the kids,

26:55.735 --> 26:57.256
deny the validity of the video.

26:57.257 --> 26:58.955
By the time it gets out, if it does,

26:58.956 --> 27:00.695
Shiraz's visit is over,

27:00.696 --> 27:02.141
the world's focused on peace

27:02.142 --> 27:03.742
in the Middle East, the Syrians look like

27:03.743 --> 27:05.711
fringe lunatics, the kids are...

27:05.712 --> 27:09.414
troublemakers who shouldn't have
been there in the first place.

27:09.415 --> 27:11.149
And if the kids are executed?

27:11.150 --> 27:13.951
Same story, sadder outcome.

27:15.053 --> 27:16.555
Sir, let me get in front of this.

27:16.556 --> 27:18.022
I know how to handle it.

27:24.029 --> 27:25.297
Sorry, Bess.

27:25.298 --> 27:28.533
You gave it a shot.

27:28.534 --> 27:30.834
Now I have to go with Russell.

27:42.514 --> 27:44.849
ELIZABETH: <i>It's my job
to advise the president.</i>

27:44.850 --> 27:46.451
<i>How am I supposed to
do that when I can get</i>

27:46.452 --> 27:48.053
<i>any time alone with the president?</i>

27:48.054 --> 27:50.355
How many e-mails did you send him?

27:50.356 --> 27:51.823
Fifteen.

27:51.824 --> 27:53.591
And...

27:53.592 --> 27:57.062
every time I got a reply
from Russell Jackson's office.

27:57.063 --> 27:58.196
What about texts?

27:58.197 --> 27:59.798
He does do texts.

27:59.799 --> 28:02.467
He refers me to Russell Jackson.

28:02.468 --> 28:04.702
Well, babe, you're new at the job.

28:04.703 --> 28:06.237
You'll figure something out.

28:06.238 --> 28:08.373
I don't have time

28:08.374 --> 28:10.674
to figure something out.

28:12.844 --> 28:16.179
Why? What's going on?

28:16.848 --> 28:19.684
I can't tell you.

28:19.685 --> 28:21.486
Okay.

28:21.487 --> 28:23.755
Let me take the Socratic approach.

28:23.756 --> 28:26.758
- (laughs)
- Why did you take this job?

28:26.759 --> 28:28.426
Because who wouldn't take this job?

28:28.427 --> 28:29.827
Hey, wise guy, I'll be Socrates.

28:29.828 --> 28:32.330
Answer the question.

28:32.331 --> 28:33.598
(sighs)

28:33.599 --> 28:36.033
I think I left The Company too soon.

28:36.034 --> 28:39.403
I had some unfinished business.

28:39.404 --> 28:42.940
And I feel like I let Conrad down.

28:42.941 --> 28:44.663
I don't want to do that again.

28:44.664 --> 28:46.010
You feel like you're
letting him down now?

28:46.011 --> 28:47.111
- Yes.
- How?

28:47.112 --> 28:49.847
By not insisting that
he do the right thing.

28:49.848 --> 28:52.817
And what's the right thing?

28:52.818 --> 28:55.485
You know, there's a reason
why they killed Socrates.

29:02.193 --> 29:05.863
He told me that we could effect
real change in the world.

29:05.864 --> 29:07.398
That's what I signed up for.

29:07.399 --> 29:11.668
Then you have to figure
out a way to take action.

29:13.437 --> 29:15.472
Thomas Aquinas said,

29:15.473 --> 29:17.942
"If the highest aim of a captain
were to preserve his ship,

29:17.943 --> 29:20.610
he would leave it in port forever."

29:22.913 --> 29:24.014
Aquinas also said,

29:24.015 --> 29:26.050
"Sorrow can be alleviated by a good sleep,

29:26.051 --> 29:28.551
a bath and a glass of wine."

29:38.495 --> 29:40.963
Which one of those worked?

29:55.212 --> 29:57.546
(hinges squeaking)

30:00.917 --> 30:03.252
(footsteps echoing)

30:08.925 --> 30:10.994
Well.

30:10.995 --> 30:12.395
It has been a long time.

30:12.396 --> 30:14.664
Thanks for coming.

30:14.665 --> 30:16.266
What can I say?

30:16.267 --> 30:17.599
I've missed you.

30:18.702 --> 30:21.504
What's it been... eight years?

30:21.505 --> 30:23.006
Yes. Chechnya.

30:23.007 --> 30:24.474
(whistles)

30:24.475 --> 30:27.877
Such a paltry little rebellion
by today's standards.

30:27.878 --> 30:29.112
What's your title these days?

30:29.113 --> 30:32.415
Still cultural attaché.

30:32.416 --> 30:35.185
I need to broker a deal

30:35.186 --> 30:37.287
on the ground... in Syria.

30:37.288 --> 30:39.055
What kind of deal?

30:39.056 --> 30:42.124
Two American kids
imprisoned for espionage.

30:42.959 --> 30:46.663
I'm sorry. I really am
a cultural attaché now.

30:46.664 --> 30:48.064
For the last couple of years.

30:48.065 --> 30:50.200
No double-dipping in the spy pool.

30:50.201 --> 30:52.268
You must still know people.

30:52.269 --> 30:56.039
Bess, I'm telling you,
I'm fully legit now.

30:56.040 --> 30:58.141
State Department.

30:58.142 --> 31:02.144
I can get you caviar and vodka.

31:03.379 --> 31:05.915
I like it here, okay?

31:05.916 --> 31:07.950
I can't risk going back to Russia.

31:07.951 --> 31:09.085
It's a pigsty.

31:09.086 --> 31:12.754
My kids are on the fast
track for Ivy Leagues.

31:15.691 --> 31:17.460
Let me ask you something.

31:17.461 --> 31:18.761
Who got your cousin

31:18.762 --> 31:22.198
and his family out of Chechnya
during the revolution?

31:22.199 --> 31:24.000
You did, of course.

31:24.001 --> 31:25.701
Using field officers on the ground

31:25.702 --> 31:27.370
who risked their lives to do so.

31:27.371 --> 31:29.572
I took responsibility for that.

31:29.573 --> 31:31.806
No, I haven't forgotten.

31:33.576 --> 31:35.878
These kids are gonna die.

31:35.879 --> 31:37.313
Just as your cousin

31:37.314 --> 31:38.604
and his family were going to.

31:38.605 --> 31:40.216
So you're cashing in your chips?

31:40.217 --> 31:42.985
No.

31:42.986 --> 31:45.920
I am appealing to your humanity.

31:51.560 --> 31:54.396
And if that doesn't
work, I'm reminding you

31:54.397 --> 31:57.466
that the Secretary of State
can have any foreign diplomat

31:57.467 --> 32:00.701
removed off of U.S. soil for any reason.

32:05.274 --> 32:08.743
I am feeling very... humane.

32:25.189 --> 32:27.024
DALTON: Let's call it a nightcap.

32:27.025 --> 32:28.959
That way I don't have to yell
at you for breaking protocol

32:28.960 --> 32:30.094
and waking me up.

32:30.095 --> 32:31.962
Yes, sir.

32:31.963 --> 32:33.597
In fact, texting my wife?

32:33.598 --> 32:35.799
(laughs) I'd call that
obliterating protocol.

32:35.800 --> 32:37.034
We've remained friends.

32:37.035 --> 32:38.969
We talk sometimes.

32:38.970 --> 32:41.771
I know she stays up late.

32:42.940 --> 32:44.274
Fine.

32:44.275 --> 32:46.742
You have my attention.

32:48.979 --> 32:51.981
I made an unofficial move
on the situation in Syria.

32:52.616 --> 32:53.884
Why would you do that?

32:53.885 --> 32:56.386
To save the lives of two innocent kids

32:56.387 --> 32:58.989
who aren't that much older than mine.

32:58.990 --> 33:00.357
That's just the first reason.

33:00.358 --> 33:01.991
You tried before.

33:03.860 --> 33:06.463
Let me ask you something.

33:06.464 --> 33:07.764
Why did you give me this job?

33:07.765 --> 33:08.832
I told you why.

33:08.833 --> 33:09.800
You said you didn't want

33:09.801 --> 33:11.334
a politician in this post.

33:11.335 --> 33:12.836
Well...

33:12.837 --> 33:14.838
this is me not being a politician.

33:14.839 --> 33:17.574
I didn't uproot my life and my family

33:17.575 --> 33:19.843
to come here and sit in
endless staff meetings

33:19.844 --> 33:21.478
and plan parties for potentates.

33:21.479 --> 33:22.912
I came here to do the job

33:22.913 --> 33:24.748
that you said only I could do.

33:24.749 --> 33:27.917
So for God's sakes, Conrad, let me do it.

33:27.918 --> 33:30.118
I'm waiting.

33:31.388 --> 33:33.723
You said I think outside the box.

33:33.724 --> 33:34.991
Well, from where I sit,

33:34.992 --> 33:36.993
you are in a dangerous
box of appeasement

33:36.994 --> 33:39.429
and I'm showing you the way out.

33:39.430 --> 33:41.029
Step it out for me.

33:42.098 --> 33:43.299
We do nothing,

33:43.300 --> 33:44.567
the Syrians execute those kids

33:44.568 --> 33:46.069
just to make a point.

33:46.070 --> 33:47.237
When it hits the press

33:47.238 --> 33:49.082
that you knew about it and did nothing?

33:49.083 --> 33:51.107
That's a genie I can't
put back in the bottle.

33:51.108 --> 33:53.309
My job is to advise you

33:53.310 --> 33:55.111
on matters of foreign policy,

33:55.112 --> 33:56.980
and I'm advising you.

33:56.981 --> 33:59.682
This is a risk you can't
afford not to take.

33:59.683 --> 34:03.685
I know the right people,
we have to do it my way.

34:04.654 --> 34:06.421
Trust me.

34:10.927 --> 34:12.829
You'd better be right about this.

34:12.830 --> 34:14.597
Or yours could be the shortest term

34:14.598 --> 34:15.764
in State Department history.

34:15.766 --> 34:18.434
Elihu B. Washburne, under President Grant.

34:18.435 --> 34:19.702
11 days.

34:19.703 --> 34:21.437
I looked it up.

34:21.438 --> 34:23.367
But I take your point.

34:23.368 --> 34:25.719
ANTON: <i>It's going to be $2 million U.S.</i>

34:25.719 --> 34:27.688
It's going to be half that.

34:27.688 --> 34:29.690
(speaks Russian)

34:29.690 --> 34:31.592
One and a half. Close of business.

34:31.592 --> 34:32.693
I can make that work.

34:32.694 --> 34:34.460
First installment with confirmation

34:34.462 --> 34:35.629
that the kids are released.

34:35.630 --> 34:37.231
Second installment after they've landed.

34:37.232 --> 34:39.565
(speaking Russian)

34:43.235 --> 34:45.739
It needs to be U.S. dollars

34:45.739 --> 34:47.507
in a third-party account.

34:47.507 --> 34:49.810
No. It's going to be that amount

34:49.811 --> 34:51.078
in the form of medical supplies

34:51.079 --> 34:52.579
and food.

34:52.580 --> 34:53.780
Nussir gets the photo op,

34:53.781 --> 34:56.216
distributing relief among
the suffering masses.

34:56.217 --> 34:58.585
I don't think it's enough.

34:58.586 --> 34:59.786
Okay, then tell them this:

34:59.787 --> 35:01.688
We won't sanction them
into the Stone Age.

35:01.689 --> 35:02.886
The tide is turning,

35:02.887 --> 35:04.424
and they do not want to be isolated

35:04.425 --> 35:05.692
on the wrong side of it.

35:05.693 --> 35:09.361
No one misses Syria if it
completely self-destructs.

35:21.574 --> 35:23.208
I think they're taking it.

35:24.944 --> 35:26.679
Congratulations.

35:26.680 --> 35:28.748
You just bought yourself
two stupid American kids.

35:28.749 --> 35:30.717
I'll believe it when they're in the air.

35:30.718 --> 35:32.094
You stay on it, okay?

35:32.095 --> 35:34.354
ANTON: Yes, ma'am, Madam Secretary.

35:34.355 --> 35:35.455
NADINE: <i>It's all right</i>

35:35.456 --> 35:37.657
to address his wives by their first names.

35:37.658 --> 35:40.159
But be advised they probably
won't have much to say.

35:40.160 --> 35:42.262
Most of them don't speak English.

35:42.263 --> 35:43.563
Unless you to speak Swazi.

35:43.564 --> 35:45.298
French, German, Arabic, Farsi...

35:45.299 --> 35:46.733
year of Spanish, high school.

35:46.734 --> 35:48.234
So you'll just smile a lot.

35:48.235 --> 35:50.670
That was a <i> New York Times</i> reporter

35:50.671 --> 35:51.971
who just got off the phone with

35:51.972 --> 35:53.172
Tyler and Ethan Cole's parents.

35:53.173 --> 35:54.966
The <i> Times</i> got the Coles
to make a statement?

35:54.967 --> 35:55.808
JAY: No.

35:55.809 --> 35:56.855
The <i> Times</i> got them to give

35:56.856 --> 35:58.454
- a two-hour interview.
- (sighs)

35:58.455 --> 36:00.480
- ELIZABETH: What did you say?
- JAY: I said no comment.

36:00.481 --> 36:01.781
Now I'm going to call Robert Cole

36:01.782 --> 36:03.505
and say a lot of things
at an elevated level.

36:03.506 --> 36:04.684
But when are they going to run it?

36:04.685 --> 36:05.852
Tomorrow.

36:05.853 --> 36:07.086
Oh. Buried in the back?

36:07.087 --> 36:08.120
JAY: Depends on how big

36:08.121 --> 36:09.821
of a news day it is.

36:12.325 --> 36:14.126
Is that personal image consultant

36:14.127 --> 36:15.828
- still in the building?
- Yeah, she's got an office

36:15.829 --> 36:16.829
on the second floor.

36:16.830 --> 36:18.698
Tell her I want to see her right away.

36:18.699 --> 36:21.032
(people talking excitedly)

36:22.868 --> 36:23.936
Madam Secretary.

36:23.937 --> 36:25.673
Hi. Congratulations on your new position.

36:25.674 --> 36:26.639
Thank you.

36:26.640 --> 36:28.541
Where are you guys from?

36:28.542 --> 36:29.809
We're from Minnesota.

36:29.810 --> 36:32.278
Ah, the land of 10,000 lakes, right?

36:32.279 --> 36:34.313
But it's actually more like 15,000.

36:34.314 --> 36:35.748
Yes, ma'am. Can we get

36:35.749 --> 36:37.149
our picture taken together?

36:37.150 --> 36:38.317
Actually, that's fine.

36:38.318 --> 36:40.386
- That'd be great.
- Thank you.

36:40.387 --> 36:42.154
I need you to step back.

36:42.155 --> 36:43.222
- Good?
- Good?

36:43.223 --> 36:44.590
- Okay.
- Thank you!

36:44.591 --> 36:45.824
Enjoy your stay.

36:45.825 --> 36:47.760
Madam... Madam Secretary!

36:47.761 --> 36:49.684
REPORTER: The response to
Secretary McCord's look

36:49.685 --> 36:51.597
has been positive, most people saying...

36:51.598 --> 36:53.999
She's showing a little bit of leg.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.336
And it looked like she went

36:55.337 --> 36:56.742
and changed her hairstyle, too!

36:56.743 --> 36:58.273
I kind of like it.

36:58.274 --> 37:01.040
REPORTER 2: ...issued no statement as
to why the Secretary felt the need

37:01.041 --> 37:02.374
to modernize her look.

37:02.375 --> 37:03.489
REPORTER 3: Secretary of State...

37:03.490 --> 37:05.040
I can't believe that
with everything going on

37:05.041 --> 37:06.408
in the world, this is the news.

37:06.409 --> 37:07.422
I mean, no offense, Mom,

37:07.423 --> 37:09.377
but a new outfit isn't
really a global event.

37:09.378 --> 37:12.013
Well, I-I guess it is now.

37:12.014 --> 37:13.281
This is the most you've
been in the news

37:13.282 --> 37:14.349
since the confirmation hearing.

37:14.350 --> 37:16.818
Yep.

37:16.819 --> 37:19.119

37:22.570 --> 37:23.762

38:28.656 --> 38:30.525
Good morning.

38:30.926 --> 38:32.392
Good morning.

38:44.772 --> 38:45.906
I didn't realize

38:45.907 --> 38:48.209
we had an appointment.

38:48.210 --> 38:50.778
You want to tell me how
those kids got released?

38:50.779 --> 38:52.847
I guess the Syrians

38:52.848 --> 38:54.547
saw the error of their ways.

38:55.149 --> 38:57.250
So that would be a "no."

38:58.452 --> 39:00.988
I got the president to sign off.

39:00.989 --> 39:02.656
How could you do that
without my knowledge?

39:02.657 --> 39:04.123
I-I don't know.

39:04.124 --> 39:07.526
By blatantly
circumnavigating your authority?

39:09.196 --> 39:10.863
You'd better learn how to work with me

39:10.864 --> 39:12.699
instead of around me.

39:12.700 --> 39:14.368
My first choice, as well.

39:14.369 --> 39:17.103
I used your stylist, didn't I?

39:19.106 --> 39:20.541
I think you'll find

39:20.542 --> 39:24.009
I make a much better ally than opponent.

39:25.078 --> 39:27.646
Same here.

39:31.318 --> 39:32.286
I'm going to chalk

39:32.287 --> 39:35.355
this one up to rookie enthusiasm.

39:35.356 --> 39:37.623
But going forward?

39:38.692 --> 39:40.960
I won't be so forgiving.

39:46.867 --> 39:49.201
(exhales)

39:50.904 --> 39:52.672
NUNGUNDE: <i>It is an honor</i>

39:52.673 --> 39:54.608
to visit your beautiful country.

39:54.609 --> 39:56.309
And its most beautiful Secretary of State.

39:56.310 --> 39:58.979
ELIZABETH: We're very happy
to have Your Highness

39:58.980 --> 40:01.146
and his royal family.

40:02.215 --> 40:05.285
NUNGUNDE: And what about your
family, Madam Secretary?

40:05.286 --> 40:06.720
Do you have children?

40:06.721 --> 40:07.921
I do. I have a son

40:07.922 --> 40:09.889
- and two daughters.
- Ah.

40:09.890 --> 40:11.057
A nice, small family.

40:11.058 --> 40:14.059
Well, I-I just have the one husband.

40:18.331 --> 40:20.567
(laughing)

40:20.568 --> 40:22.901
(all laughing)

40:23.603 --> 40:24.704
NUNGUNDE: Yes.

40:24.705 --> 40:27.707
I am honored to have 23 children.

40:27.708 --> 40:29.642
Wow.

40:29.643 --> 40:32.679
That sounds like a lot of work.

40:32.680 --> 40:36.047
Well, I am blessed with
wonderful partners.

40:36.816 --> 40:37.984
ELIZABETH: Your Highness,

40:37.985 --> 40:39.619
if I could take a moment

40:39.620 --> 40:41.287
to discuss with you a matter

40:41.288 --> 40:42.555
of international importance?

40:42.556 --> 40:43.922
Of course.

40:44.657 --> 40:46.592
I know that you're aware

40:46.593 --> 40:47.794
that the AIDS epidemic

40:47.795 --> 40:49.811
has continued to grow in your country

40:49.812 --> 40:51.964
despite its decline in
other developing nations.

40:51.965 --> 40:53.699
Early on in your reign,

40:53.700 --> 40:55.301
you took great steps to address it,

40:55.302 --> 40:57.970
but lately it hasn't been at the forefront

40:57.971 --> 40:59.372
of your political agenda.

40:59.373 --> 41:01.140
Certainly, a man of your education

41:01.141 --> 41:04.076
and obvious love of family understands

41:04.077 --> 41:05.977
the importance of this issue.

41:07.413 --> 41:09.315
We would like to work with you

41:09.316 --> 41:11.916
to bring it back to the top of your list.

41:18.658 --> 41:22.460
It would be an honor to
do so, Madam Secretary.

41:23.729 --> 41:28.100
I'm sure that you can enlist
the help of your wives...

41:28.101 --> 41:29.634
Majaha...

41:30.936 --> 41:32.538
Sibhale...

41:32.539 --> 41:33.572
Lindelwa...

41:33.573 --> 41:34.874
Nomcebo,

41:34.875 --> 41:36.041
Nolwazi,

41:36.042 --> 41:37.276
Siviwe,

41:37.277 --> 41:39.111
Temily, Dzeltwe,

41:39.112 --> 41:41.413
Andiswa

41:41.414 --> 41:43.148
and Bongeka.

41:43.149 --> 41:44.650
(people whispering)

41:44.651 --> 41:47.453
A woman's perspective is
such an important thing...

41:47.454 --> 41:51.556
and you have no shortage of that.

41:57.296 --> 41:59.031
DAISY: That exchange with the King

41:59.032 --> 42:00.332
is already trending, Madam Secretary.

42:00.333 --> 42:02.234
Twitter is blowing up. People love it.

42:02.235 --> 42:03.469
Well, not everyone's going to love it.

42:03.470 --> 42:04.803
Matt, prepare a statement for tomorrow.

42:04.804 --> 42:06.438
We may have to call a press conference.

42:06.439 --> 42:07.639
I'm already on it.

42:07.640 --> 42:08.841
Do you want this to become an issue?

42:08.842 --> 42:10.042
Yes!

42:10.043 --> 42:12.044
I think we've spent
enough time on my look.

42:12.045 --> 42:14.012
World health, education, war on women...

42:14.013 --> 42:15.080
how do you want to frame it?

42:15.081 --> 42:16.582
All of the above.

42:16.583 --> 42:18.360
JAY: It's a strong message.
It'll play well in the polls.

42:18.361 --> 42:20.185
Not that I, you know, care about polls.

42:20.186 --> 42:22.621
Car is waiting for you
outside when you're ready.

42:22.622 --> 42:24.022
I'll tell security to stand by.

42:24.023 --> 42:25.557
Thanks, Blake.

42:25.558 --> 42:27.892
Nice work, Madam Secretary.

42:31.630 --> 42:33.964
Thank you.

42:37.936 --> 42:39.503
Ooh...

42:43.708 --> 42:44.743
Hey.

42:44.744 --> 42:46.645
How long have you been here?

42:46.646 --> 42:48.280
You know, if you wanted to come tonight,

42:48.281 --> 42:50.215
I could have gotten you an invitation,

42:50.216 --> 42:51.483
because I

42:51.484 --> 42:54.284
happen to know people in the...

42:55.453 --> 42:57.588
What's wrong?

42:59.057 --> 43:00.591
George is dead.

43:02.794 --> 43:04.828
(gasps)

43:07.097 --> 43:09.565
What happened?

43:10.901 --> 43:12.102
Single-car collision

43:12.103 --> 43:14.104
into a telephone pole.

43:14.105 --> 43:16.405
No witnesses.

43:19.710 --> 43:21.412
That wasn't an accident.

43:21.413 --> 43:23.413
I know.
