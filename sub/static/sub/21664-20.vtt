WEBVTT

00:00.801 --> 00:02.234
Me on, Frankie, pick up!

00:02.336 --> 00:03.769
I am
Frankie's telephonic device.

00:03.871 --> 00:05.804
After the 1,000 hertz
soundwave signal,

00:05.906 --> 00:07.139
please convey information.

00:07.241 --> 00:09.141
- Where are you?
- We've got trouble.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.845
Some bad people are
coming for you today.

00:12.947 --> 00:14.279
Call me!

00:14.382 --> 00:16.315
And you have to change
your voicemail greeting.

00:17.985 --> 00:19.151
Thanks, Robbie.
Gotta go.

00:24.859 --> 00:26.492
- Well, this is the place.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.328
- I... I think I'm gonna be...

00:30.865 --> 00:32.164
- What is Byron gonna be?

00:32.266 --> 00:35.434
- He's gonna be...
ready for states.

00:35.536 --> 00:40.005
Are you nervous?
Do... androids get nervous?

00:40.107 --> 00:41.673
- Androids aren't designed
to feel emotions

00:41.776 --> 00:43.075
such as nervousness.

00:43.177 --> 00:44.710
But...
- You do.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.178
- Yes.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.580
I don't know how or why, but
I'm capable of experiencing

00:48.682 --> 00:50.482
many different emotions.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.818
- Good thing this place has
those plants over there.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.287
That could've been ugly.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.923
- Were you over at those plants
getting ready for states?

00:58.025 --> 01:02.694
- Uh, yes, exactly.
I'm ready now.

01:02.797 --> 01:04.396
- I gotta go home and change.

01:04.498 --> 01:07.633
But I'll be back.
Nothing could keep me away.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:17.912 --> 01:18.944
- Calm down.

01:19.046 --> 01:20.012
You're gonna freak
everyone else out.

01:20.114 --> 01:21.780
- I'm... I'm calm, totally.

01:28.856 --> 01:29.922
- Where is Tammy?

01:30.024 --> 01:31.490
I wouldn't expect
her to be late,

01:31.592 --> 01:34.460
considering what's at stake.
- Good thing we have a sub.

01:34.562 --> 01:35.494
You ready, John?

01:36.363 --> 01:38.397
- Um, yeah, I'm ready.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.233
- We better try to find Tammy.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.313
- Guilford Kingston.

01:55.916 --> 01:58.750
Wait, wait, wait.
A rumor Eliza is in the area?

01:58.853 --> 02:01.320
Well, get back to me when
it's more than just rumor.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.555
Oh, I gotta go.
Don't call me here again.

02:04.992 --> 02:06.158
Just the two of you again?

02:06.260 --> 02:08.727
- Don't tell us how to
do our job, Kingston.

02:09.896 --> 02:11.363
- Oh, greetings, Kingston.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.465
Care to introduce
me to your friends?

02:13.567 --> 02:16.502
Dr. James Peters, PhD
in applied robotics.

02:17.905 --> 02:19.104
190 IQ.

02:19.206 --> 02:21.039
Likely higher,
but the test administrator

02:21.142 --> 02:22.608
totally had a grudge against me.

02:22.710 --> 02:25.177
- Peters is the one who
messed up the last rendezvous.

02:25.279 --> 02:27.279
I hope you don't screw up
again, for both our sakes.

02:27.381 --> 02:28.680
- It's all set.

02:28.782 --> 02:31.550
My, uh, son will take
Frankie wherever you want.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.252
Just say the word.
Right, Andrew?

02:33.354 --> 02:35.387
- We'll give the signal at
the end of the competition.

02:36.690 --> 02:37.856
- I gotta go.

02:37.958 --> 02:40.192
Communicate via text only, hm?

02:40.294 --> 02:42.060
- Nobody use emojis.

02:42.163 --> 02:44.129
I can never tell
what the smiles mean.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.099
What?
I didn't do anything.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.676
- Hello, Tammy Gilroy.
- You're here!

03:00.214 --> 03:02.614
- Finally.
We've been waiting for you.

03:02.716 --> 03:03.649
- Hi, Tammy.

03:05.686 --> 03:06.818
Sorry.

03:08.289 --> 03:10.722
- It's just a little sweat.
No biggie.

03:13.194 --> 03:15.260
- No biggie?
Are you okay?

03:15.362 --> 03:16.995
- Did you get invaded
by a parasite

03:17.097 --> 03:18.697
that alters your personality?

03:18.799 --> 03:20.365
- That's ridiculous.

03:20.467 --> 03:22.968
There's nothing wrong with me.
I'm completely normal.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.773
Now let's get out there.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.008
Sepulveda on three.

03:30.110 --> 03:32.311
One, two, three.

03:32.413 --> 03:35.314
- Sepulveda!
- Let's go!

03:36.517 --> 03:40.018
- Thank you for coming to
the Brain Squad state finals!

03:44.158 --> 03:46.558
- Now let's meet
our state finalists,

03:46.660 --> 03:49.361
Morlock High and Sepulveda High!

04:02.376 --> 04:03.542
- Let's begin.

04:03.644 --> 04:06.144
Our first question is a toss-up.

04:06.247 --> 04:07.980
And the category is...

04:09.116 --> 04:11.316
- Frankie!
I have to talk to you.

04:11.418 --> 04:12.851
- What in the world?

04:35.743 --> 04:37.109
- Security, get her out of here.

04:37.211 --> 04:38.410
- Wait, wait!
No, no, no.

04:38.512 --> 04:40.612
I have to talk to Frankie.
Get your hands off me!

04:40.714 --> 04:41.613
No! Hey!

04:41.715 --> 04:43.415
Frankie!
Frankie!

04:43.517 --> 04:45.651
No! Stop!

04:45.753 --> 04:46.852
Back to business.

04:46.954 --> 04:51.056
Question one.
Cateogry, molecular genetics.

04:51.158 --> 04:54.626
The allele responsible for
sickle cell anemia can be found

04:54.728 --> 04:56.828
on the short arm
of what chromosome?

04:56.930 --> 04:58.230
Sepulveda?

04:58.332 --> 05:00.966
- Chromosome 11p15.5.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.769
- They're my children...

05:03.871 --> 05:05.570
That is correct.

05:08.842 --> 05:11.076
- Come on!
- I gotta talk to my friend!

05:11.178 --> 05:13.445
It's a matter of life or death!

05:13.547 --> 05:14.780
- Life or death?

05:14.882 --> 05:16.815
These competitions are
getting crazier every year.

05:19.286 --> 05:21.253
- Frankie's in trouble!
I don't have time to explain,

05:21.355 --> 05:23.555
but we have to warn her.
I have to get in.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.090
- No way they let you back in.

05:25.192 --> 05:27.459
- Good point.
You have to warn her.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.394
No, wait!
You create a diversion.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.730
Run in and start acting crazy.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.632
While they're tackling
you and beating you up,

05:33.734 --> 05:36.234
I'll sneak in and warn Frankie.
- Tackling me and beating me up?

05:36.337 --> 05:37.736
- I thought you
cared about Frankie.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.805
- I do, but can't we
come up with a plan

05:39.907 --> 05:41.173
that doesn't involve me
getting broken ribs?

05:41.275 --> 05:42.107
- Fine!

05:42.209 --> 05:43.709
You have three seconds
to think of one.

05:43.811 --> 05:44.943
Time's up!
Let's go.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.082
Stay on your feet
as long as you can.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.817
- Well, goodbye, front teeth.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.318
We chomped some really
good food together.

05:54.488 --> 05:55.454
- Excuse me.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.560
- Saturn's largest
moon is Titan.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.362
Correct.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.997
- Next question, astronomy.

06:06.100 --> 06:08.734
If you weigh 100
pounds on Earth,

06:08.836 --> 06:10.902
how much would you
weigh on the sun?

06:11.004 --> 06:12.304
Trick question.

06:12.406 --> 06:14.740
Zero pounds.
You would burn to a crisp.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.842
- Good try, but incorrect.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.744
Morlock?

06:18.846 --> 06:21.513
- 2,790 pounds.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.281
Correct.

06:31.325 --> 06:32.357
Cole?

06:36.630 --> 06:37.629
Where are we?

06:38.866 --> 06:40.265
Who were those guys?

06:40.367 --> 06:44.035
- They must be from WARPA.
It's a secret government agency.

06:44.138 --> 06:47.305
They're trying to steal Frankie
and turn her into a weapon.

06:47.408 --> 06:49.207
Dad's working with them.

06:49.309 --> 06:51.209
- Dad?
Figures.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.179
We have to tell Frankie.
- Yeah.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.048
- What?
- What?

06:58.852 --> 07:01.753
Give me your phone.
- Yeah, here.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.221
Who are you calling?
- Frankie's mom.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.491
What?
No signal!

07:06.593 --> 07:08.693
We need to get out of here.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.695
Look for something that
I can use as a screwdriver.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.238
- Here.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.608
- Okay.
Here goes nothing.

07:27.448 --> 07:29.514
Islets of Langerhans.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.283
"Citizen Kane."

07:31.385 --> 07:32.918
"Thus Spoke Zarathustra."

07:33.020 --> 07:34.853
Plantar fasciitis.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.922
Salmon P. Chase.

07:43.764 --> 07:44.863
Magma.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.531
Toxoplasmosis.

07:46.633 --> 07:47.899
Reem Tower.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.734
The Neuschwanstein Castle.

08:05.319 --> 08:07.285
Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

08:10.324 --> 08:12.591
And that is
the final question

08:12.693 --> 08:13.859
of our competition.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.727
And the score is...

08:15.829 --> 08:17.629
...all tied up.

08:17.731 --> 08:21.199
For our tiebreaker, each school
will elect one team member

08:21.301 --> 08:24.569
to answer a single question
on the topic of...

08:28.308 --> 08:30.742
- Shouting out your subjects
will not make me choose it.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.143
Uh-uh-uh!

08:33.080 --> 08:34.712
The topic is...

08:34.815 --> 08:36.114
...robotics.

08:37.518 --> 08:40.952
- This is a no-brainer.
We have a robotics expert.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.020
- Come on, Byron.
We're all counting on you.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.123
This is the big one!
No pressure.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.959
- No, not Byron.
Frankie.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.594
- Oh, because you
think she's a...

08:49.696 --> 08:51.096
- Now is not the time, Tammy.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.164
- No, that's not
what this is about.

08:53.267 --> 08:56.001
Frankie's been playing great,
and Bryon is...

08:57.104 --> 08:58.470
Where did he go?

09:01.875 --> 09:03.475
What do you think, Frankie?

09:03.577 --> 09:05.010
Can you do it?

09:08.015 --> 09:09.581
- You bet your butt I can.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.450
- Morlock contestant,
are you ready?

09:12.553 --> 09:14.786
Sepulveda contestant,
are you ready?

09:14.888 --> 09:17.289
- Yes, I am.
- Here is your question.

09:17.391 --> 09:20.458
Over the past several decades,
amazing strides have been made

09:20.561 --> 09:23.428
in robot engineering and
artificial intelligence.

09:23.530 --> 09:27.699
But has a robot ever
displayed human emotions?

09:29.436 --> 09:30.569
Morlock?

09:30.671 --> 09:33.271
- No robot has ever been
able to experience emotions.

09:33.373 --> 09:34.973
It's a scientific impossibility.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.108
That is correct.

09:37.210 --> 09:40.512
And that means that Morlock
High is our new Brain...

09:40.614 --> 09:41.513
- That is incorrect.

09:42.649 --> 09:44.149
I'm sorry?

09:44.251 --> 09:47.085
- A robot can experience
human emotions.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.587
I know this for a fact.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.689
- I can assure you that
all of our questions

09:50.791 --> 09:51.990
have been thoroughly researched.

09:52.092 --> 09:56.728
But there is room for error.
What is your source?

09:56.830 --> 10:01.232
How do you know that robots are
capable of experiencing emotion?

10:03.403 --> 10:04.903
Ponse.

10:05.005 --> 10:07.305
Sepulveda, do you have proof?

10:08.642 --> 10:10.375
- Yes, I do.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.784
- Research by
Forenz and Merovingian

10:19.886 --> 10:22.153
at the Düsseldorf Institute of
Artificial Intelligence

10:22.255 --> 10:24.222
states that their android,
Hyperion 9,

10:24.324 --> 10:26.324
experienced happiness when
reunited with its creator

10:26.426 --> 10:28.259
after a lengthy absence.

10:28.362 --> 10:30.862
- Forenz and Merovingian.
I hate those hacks.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.231
- Their study was only
released publicly last week,

10:33.333 --> 10:35.233
so it's understandable
that you missed it.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.668
- We're looking into it.

10:36.770 --> 10:41.406
Ugh, frozen pinwheel of death.
Update your laptop, Gerard!

10:43.310 --> 10:44.676
Wait a minute.

10:44.778 --> 10:48.446
Challenge is upheld.
Sepulveda wins.

10:48.548 --> 10:51.082
Our new Brain Squad
state champion!

10:55.422 --> 10:57.088
Congratulations!

10:57.190 --> 10:58.256
Yes!

11:08.101 --> 11:09.901
- Now let's do it.

11:15.876 --> 11:18.943
- It's turning, but
it's not coming out.

11:21.314 --> 11:22.647
It's as far
as it's gonna go.

11:23.550 --> 11:24.783
- What are you doing?

11:24.885 --> 11:27.085
What, are you just giving up?
What about Frankie?

11:27.187 --> 11:28.253
- I think we...

11:32.292 --> 11:34.059
...loosened it up.
- Come on!

11:36.830 --> 11:39.064
It's over.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.231
- We have to find her.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.000
- Split up.
Look everywhere.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.604
We won!

11:46.707 --> 11:48.673
- Time to celebrate!
- Woo!

11:52.412 --> 11:54.713
Dude, what was that?

11:54.815 --> 11:56.614
- You know when the
football team wins

11:56.717 --> 11:58.516
and they dump the
cooler on the coach?

11:58.618 --> 12:00.085
This is all we have, so...

12:07.427 --> 12:09.527
- Andrew, where's Frankie?
She's in trouble.

12:09.629 --> 12:11.596
- I'll take care of it.
- Dude, I get it.

12:11.698 --> 12:13.698
You like her.
I like her.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.467
But we have to work
together to help her.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.368
Some bad dudes from
Warsaw or something

12:17.471 --> 12:18.503
are trying to kidnap her.

12:18.605 --> 12:20.138
- You can't stop them.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.140
Get out of here.
I don't want to hurt you.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.475
- Wait, what?

12:24.411 --> 12:25.610
You're part of this.

12:30.717 --> 12:32.350
- Stay out of this, Coleslaw.

12:42.829 --> 12:44.562
- Andrew LaPierre, come
join the victory celebration.

12:44.664 --> 12:46.431
- You have to come with me.
- Why?

12:46.533 --> 12:47.966
- It's for your
own good, trust me.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.910
- Copy that.
Target is on the move.

13:06.520 --> 13:10.088
- Cole? Cole!
Hey, hey, are you all right?

13:10.190 --> 13:13.925
- Man, me and this hotel carpet
are really getting close today.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.627
- What happened?

13:15.729 --> 13:17.996
- It was Andrew.
- Andrew?

13:18.098 --> 13:19.564
- He's in on it too.

13:19.666 --> 13:22.100
- Oh, I knew I was
right about him.

13:22.202 --> 13:23.535
- He's gonna get Frankie!

13:23.637 --> 13:25.703
We have to find her
before it's too late.

13:25.806 --> 13:26.905
- Come on.

13:28.108 --> 13:31.176
- Where are you taking me?
- There's some people here.

13:31.278 --> 13:33.011
- Yes, there are
many people here.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.312
My teammates are people.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.047
I would prefer to be
celebrating with them.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.817
Byron promised to show us
a dance called the Woo 10.

13:38.919 --> 13:41.586
- I'm afraid that's impossible.
- I disagree.

13:41.688 --> 13:43.655
Byron's not a skilled
dancer, but anyone can learn.

13:43.757 --> 13:46.224
Andrew LaPierre, are you okay?

13:46.326 --> 13:48.526
- Hurry.
- You have to go.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.562
- Go? Go where?
- Away from here, quick.

13:50.664 --> 13:51.930
- You're having a
serious hardware issue.

13:52.032 --> 13:54.232
You need to run
diagnostics and get help.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.867
- Don't worry about me.
Just go.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.202
- I'm not leaving you.

13:57.304 --> 13:58.670
You've got to tell
me what's going on.

13:58.772 --> 14:00.371
- People here, they're bad.
They're gonna kidnap you.

14:01.741 --> 14:02.941
- Dr. Peters, he's
working with them.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.710
He programmed me to
follow his commands.

14:06.780 --> 14:08.479
- I have to turn
you over to WARPA.

14:08.582 --> 14:09.781
- But you're letting me go.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.216
Is that why you're
malfunctioning?

14:11.318 --> 14:13.051
- It's hard to go
against programming.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.819
But I can't let them take you.

14:15.789 --> 14:18.122
I... like you too much.

14:18.225 --> 14:20.592
- Andrew? Andrew?

14:25.866 --> 14:27.999
The android should
be here by now.

14:28.101 --> 14:30.034
Something's going on.

14:30.136 --> 14:32.203
All agents, operation
may be compromised.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.839
Move in.
Find the android now.

14:50.457 --> 14:51.689
- Hello?
- Hello, Cole Reyes.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.358
It's...
- Frankie!

14:53.460 --> 14:56.361
I mean, Leo.
What's cracking, buddy?

14:56.463 --> 14:58.796
- I am not Leo.
I am Frankie.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.365
- Hang on, Leo.
I can't hear you.

15:00.467 --> 15:01.866
Let me go someplace quieter.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.071
Frankie, are you okay?
Andrew was coming after you.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.774
I tried to stop him, but...
I couldn't.

15:09.876 --> 15:11.809
- Andrew helped me.
Now he's...

15:13.313 --> 15:14.479
I need help.
- I'm with Dayton.

15:14.581 --> 15:15.813
We'll help you.
Where are you?

15:15.916 --> 15:17.715
- In the parking lot behind
the mobile waste bin.

15:17.817 --> 15:20.118
- All right, sit tight.
- How does one sit tight?

15:20.220 --> 15:22.220
I know how to sit up,
sit down, sit around,

15:22.322 --> 15:23.554
and sit for a portrait, but...

15:23.657 --> 15:25.356
- It just means
stay where you are!

15:25.458 --> 15:26.724
Sorry, I didn't mean to be rude.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.693
I'm just worried about you
and we're short on time.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.828
And I hope you're not mad...
- Cut it, lover boy!

15:30.931 --> 15:33.064
- We'll be right there.
We'll get you out of here.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.265
Let's go.
- Hang on.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.967
Those WARPA jerks
are everywhere.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.635
We need a plan.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.480
I thought you said

15:49.582 --> 15:51.416
you were going to keep
my daughter out of this.

15:51.518 --> 15:52.717
What are
you talking about?

15:52.819 --> 15:55.019
- She is in the lobby
disguised as a maid.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.821
The android is in
the laundry cart.

15:56.923 --> 15:58.990
I repeat, the android
is in the cart.

15:59.092 --> 15:59.924
- Freeze!

16:05.899 --> 16:07.932
- False alarm, Kingston.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.635
Continue the search.

16:20.447 --> 16:22.647
I think it worked.
- It appears so.

16:23.950 --> 16:26.084
This vehicle's destination
is the airport.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.652
What will we do
when we get there?

16:27.754 --> 16:29.120
- I have no idea.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.755
Let's just get away
from the hotel.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.590
We'll figure out our next
move when we get there.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.726
- Thank you for
saving me, Cole Reyes.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.329
I'm sorry.

16:38.431 --> 16:41.232
- I was not reacting to
the touch of your hand.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.166
I like it.

16:43.269 --> 16:45.503
I was just thinking
about Andrew LaPierre.

16:45.605 --> 16:50.842
- Oh, him.
Uh, is Andrew an android too?

16:50.944 --> 16:51.743
- Yes.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.678
Andrew LaPierre
saved me from WARPA.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.947
But when he defied James
Peters' programming,

16:56.049 --> 16:58.616
it caused a catastrophic
system malfunction.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.051
He needs tech support badly.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.988
- Don't worry.
We'll get him help.

17:08.294 --> 17:10.694
- I'm not getting a pulse.
Call for an ambulance.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.063
Andrew, where are you?

17:15.969 --> 17:17.702
Oh, great, now what?

17:17.804 --> 17:20.371
- Your son's badly hurt,
and that's how you react?

17:20.473 --> 17:23.207
- It's not my son.
It's an android.

17:23.309 --> 17:24.541
I call it Andrew.

17:24.644 --> 17:27.678
It's short for anthropomorphic
digital electronic robot device.

17:27.781 --> 17:28.780
- That spells Anderd.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.382
- Right, but Anderd
is a stupid name.

17:31.484 --> 17:34.318
- Well, it fooled us.
We thought it was your kid.

17:34.421 --> 17:38.056
- Its capacities far exceed
the android you are after.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.864
- It looks like it's
gonna need a tune-up.

17:46.966 --> 17:49.200
Probably an easy fix.
Help me get it to the car.

17:49.302 --> 17:50.835
- Sure thing.

17:50.937 --> 17:52.603
You say this one's as good
as that other android?

17:52.705 --> 17:53.871
- It's far better.

17:53.973 --> 17:55.873
It runs on the same operating
system developed by

17:55.975 --> 17:59.544
Dr. Gaines and me, but I've
made significant improvements.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.022
- Where are you going?
I'm parked down the street.

18:11.124 --> 18:12.423
- We're taking this android.

18:12.525 --> 18:13.791
- You can't do that.
It's mine.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.526
- We were promised an
android for Project Q

18:15.628 --> 18:16.861
and now we've got one.

18:16.963 --> 18:18.763
- But it's damaged.
Only I can fix it.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.401
Ow, ow!
What are you doing?

18:23.503 --> 18:24.902
Let go of me!

18:26.039 --> 18:28.206
- Seven hours, six
different towns,

18:28.308 --> 18:30.108
and we didn't see
one suitable home

18:30.210 --> 18:32.210
to accommodate the four of us.

18:32.312 --> 18:33.277
- Says you.

18:33.379 --> 18:35.546
What about the place
with the hot tub?

18:35.648 --> 18:37.915
- It was a one-bedroom camper.
- And?

18:38.017 --> 18:39.117
We always talk
about going camping.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.419
- On vacation, not permanently.

18:42.522 --> 18:43.788
- Frankie, we're home!

18:45.158 --> 18:46.090
- Frankie!

18:48.094 --> 18:50.128
She didn't!
- Now let's not panic just yet.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.597
She's probably just... resting.

19:03.076 --> 19:04.575
- Sig, take a breath.

19:04.677 --> 19:06.210
She probably went
to the Brain Squad.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.912
You know how important
it is to her.

19:08.014 --> 19:10.648
- And that's okay with you?
She could be in grave danger.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.283
- We don't know that.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.318
Besides, I admire her
commitment to the team.

19:16.055 --> 19:17.155
Reminds me how
dedicated I was

19:17.257 --> 19:18.956
to my high school
stamp collecting club.

19:19.058 --> 19:20.691
- Well, it would've
been over hours ago.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.460
She should be home by now.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.061
- Postage Aficionados Unite.

19:24.964 --> 19:26.564
Sorry.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.999
- Perfect!

19:41.748 --> 19:44.315
- Hey, hey!
You gotta pay your fare.

19:44.417 --> 19:48.553
- Try and make me, human.
No one tells Eliza what to do.

20:01.834 --> 20:04.001
That'll be $22...

20:11.110 --> 20:12.910
- Now what?
You can't go home.

20:13.012 --> 20:15.046
That's the first place
I'd look if I was WARPA.

20:16.449 --> 20:17.515
My house is out.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.951
My dad could come home,
and that's just as bad.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.055
Frankie, I don't
know what to do.

20:25.491 --> 20:27.325
Frankie?
Are you okay?

20:27.427 --> 20:29.393
Do you need to be
plugged in or something?

20:29.495 --> 20:32.163
- I am fine, Cole Reyes.
I am just scanning my files.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.131
- Your files?
- For what?

20:34.234 --> 20:37.335
- My system contains over
200 million pages of content.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.971
I am certain one of them will
provide helpful information.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.606
- Frankie, I don't
think the answer's

20:41.708 --> 20:43.107
gonna be in your system.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.410
Emergency file found.

20:48.715 --> 20:50.414
- Frankie, if you've
found this file,

20:50.516 --> 20:53.251
it means something
very bad has happened.

20:53.353 --> 20:56.754
Listen closely and
then delete this file.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.556
There is a safe
place for you to go.

21:01.060 --> 21:03.127
- You are mistaken, Cole Reyes.

21:14.641 --> 21:17.241
- There you are!
My god, we were worried sick.

21:17.343 --> 21:18.976
Don't you ever pull a
stunt like this again.

21:19.078 --> 21:20.511
Do you understand me?

21:20.613 --> 21:21.779
- Sorry, Mom.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.147
- Go upstairs to
your charging pod.

21:23.249 --> 21:24.782
I need you fully charged
and ready to go

21:24.884 --> 21:28.019
by first thing in the morning.
We're getting out of here.

21:28.121 --> 21:29.920
- Hang on.
How was it?

21:30.023 --> 21:32.923
- How was what?
- The Brain Squad.

21:35.828 --> 21:37.695
- Oh, great.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.797
We won.
Woo-hoo!
