The world's biggest dance competition
starts now.

00:40.867 --> 00:42.533
And introducing your host
and dance mentor

00:42.533 --> 00:46.467
Jenna Dewan Tatum,

00:46.467 --> 00:51.867
breakout star of "Step Up"
and professional dancer.

00:51.867 --> 00:53.467
I was a very competitive dancer

00:53.467 --> 00:55.600
so coming to this competition,

00:55.600 --> 00:57.367
I really know what
they're going through.

01:00.633 --> 01:04.632
Dancers will compete
within three divisions:

01:07.300 --> 01:10.633
I'm so inspired, and
I'm honored to be here.

01:14.733 --> 01:17.867
I am so excited to show
what we're made of.

01:22.233 --> 01:23.733
We have the passion.
We have the fire.

01:23.733 --> 01:26.633
We want this so bad.

01:26.633 --> 01:29.500
The acts will be
awarded points from zero to 20

01:29.500 --> 01:31.933
in each of five categories,

01:31.933 --> 01:35.633
performance, technique,
choreography,

01:35.633 --> 01:38.233
creativity, and presentation

01:38.233 --> 01:43.233
for a maximum possible score of 100.

01:46.769 --> 01:48.919
__

01:49.019 --> 01:50.695
__

01:51.007 --> 01:52.840
__

01:52.940 --> 01:55.224
__

01:56.067 --> 01:59.800
Then in the World Final,
the three division winners

01:59.800 --> 02:01.467
will go head-to-head

02:01.467 --> 02:05.967
for the life-changing $1 million prize.

02:05.967 --> 02:07.967
Get ready...

02:09.467 --> 02:11.167
As the best in the world...

02:11.167 --> 02:12.833
Ahh!

02:12.833 --> 02:16.467
Absolutely extraordinary.

02:16.467 --> 02:21.567
Push themselves to the limit.

02:21.567 --> 02:23.167
Whoa.

02:23.167 --> 02:25.533
Now we're cooking with some hot sauce.

02:28.633 --> 02:31.933
It's got to be the best
you've ever done.

02:38.700 --> 02:39.867
I want more.

02:39.867 --> 02:41.633
Can I have some more?

02:44.300 --> 02:47.467
They will have one shot
to seriously impress

02:47.467 --> 02:50.833
three of the world's biggest
dance legends.

02:50.833 --> 02:53.000
Please welcome your judges.

02:58.700 --> 03:02.467
Emmy Award-winning choreography
and record six-time champion

03:02.467 --> 03:06.133
of "Dancing with the Stars,"
Derek Hough,

03:06.133 --> 03:09.400
multiplatinum Grammy
Award-winning R&B singer

03:09.400 --> 03:14.133
and dancer, Ne-Yo,
and Jennifer Lopez,

03:14.133 --> 03:16.033
global pop phenomenon,

03:16.033 --> 03:18.967
who sold over 80 million albums
worldwide,

03:18.967 --> 03:21.333
movie icon and TV superstar,

03:21.333 --> 03:24.600
who got her break
as a professional dancer.

03:24.600 --> 03:28.867
I started as a dancer,
and I know it takes commitment,

03:28.867 --> 03:30.667
passion, heart.

03:30.667 --> 03:32.867
There's been dance shows,
but we wanted to create

03:32.867 --> 03:35.600
the Olympics of dance.

03:35.600 --> 03:39.467
This is a chance to say,
"I am the best in the world."

03:43.867 --> 03:46.200
That's what I'm talking about.

03:46.200 --> 03:51.700
This is "World of Dance."

03:51.700 --> 03:53.967
First day at school.
Where's the cool kids?

03:53.967 --> 03:55.533
- What we doing?
- This is the cool kids.

03:55.533 --> 03:57.100
I don't know if I've ever been
at the cool kids' table.

03:57.100 --> 03:58.035
This is the first time?

03:58.135 --> 03:58.910
This is my first time at
the cool kids' table.

03:59.100 --> 04:00.167
- Thank you.
- Well, welcome.

04:04.700 --> 04:07.767
When we're on that dance floor out there...

04:07.767 --> 04:09.133
- No mercy.
- No mercy.

04:09.133 --> 04:11.584
We are... Super Cr3w.

04:11.667 --> 04:15.133
From Las Vegas, and we are B-boys.

04:15.133 --> 04:16.800
A B-boy is basically a break-dancer.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.533
We do tricks like flips,
freezes, and flairs.

04:21.632 --> 04:24.333
We've been representing for 17 years.

04:24.333 --> 04:26.100
And we've had success in the past,

04:26.100 --> 04:28.400
these guys winning Red Bull BC One,

04:28.400 --> 04:31.900
he's a two-time champion,
and "Star Search" champion

04:31.900 --> 04:34.567
right here, my man Do-Knock.

04:34.567 --> 04:37.633
This is by far the biggest competition
we ever competed in,

04:37.633 --> 04:39.833
so for us to win would mean a lot.

04:39.833 --> 04:41.100
It's our time.

04:41.100 --> 04:44.800
And these three judges have
the best credentials as dancers.

04:44.800 --> 04:48.000
They've had so many experiences
in their careers.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.800
We're here to learn.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.433
And now we're in our mid-30s.

04:51.433 --> 04:53.133
Some of us are in our later 20s.

04:53.133 --> 04:54.733
We're B-men now.
We were B-boys.

04:54.733 --> 04:55.833
- Now we're B-men.
- We're B-men.

04:55.833 --> 04:56.867
Yeah.

04:56.867 --> 04:57.933
A lot of people probably think,
you know,

04:57.933 --> 04:59.233
"Oh, it's time to hang up the hat."

04:59.233 --> 05:02.667
But we want to show that,
"Yo, we're still chasing our dream."

05:02.667 --> 05:04.100
What does this mean for you?

05:04.100 --> 05:06.200
We want to compete with
the best of the best, you know,

05:06.200 --> 05:08.900
and to win it, I mean,
this is gonna change our lives.

05:08.900 --> 05:09.900
All right, guys.

05:09.900 --> 05:12.067
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

05:13.067 --> 05:14.400
Whoo!

05:14.400 --> 05:15.533
Come on!

05:15.533 --> 05:18.333
All right, here we go.

05:18.333 --> 05:22.433
First to take the stage,
Super Cr3w.

05:33.997 --> 05:36.137
__

07:12.633 --> 07:15.367
Whoo!

07:18.900 --> 07:20.633
I'll tell you what.

07:20.633 --> 07:22.900
I've worked with a lot of B-boys
over the years,

07:22.900 --> 07:25.533
and one of the challenging things
with choreographing

07:25.533 --> 07:28.000
B-boys is that it can get repetitive

07:28.000 --> 07:30.200
or people don't know what to do with them.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.833
What you guys did up there,
honestly,

07:31.833 --> 07:33.300
I was afraid to look away,

07:33.300 --> 07:35.367
'cause I was afraid
I was gonna miss something.

07:35.367 --> 07:37.567
That's how exciting you made it.

07:39.033 --> 07:41.500
I've got to say this for
everybody here that doesn't know

07:41.500 --> 07:44.500
what it is to be a B-boy,
they make it look so easy.

07:44.500 --> 07:47.633
The difficulty of some of the things
that you guys are doing,

07:47.633 --> 07:48.967
it's, like, God.

07:48.967 --> 07:51.400
What was that one move in the front
where you kind of--

07:51.400 --> 07:53.700
what do you call those where you guys...

07:53.700 --> 07:54.933
Wow.

07:54.933 --> 07:57.300
Yes.

08:00.933 --> 08:02.133
Hold on. Wait.
My turn. My turn.

08:02.133 --> 08:03.233
No, no.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.933
No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

08:06.300 --> 08:08.133
Super smooth, super together.

08:08.133 --> 08:10.567
You guys are water, man, water,
every move.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.667
Derek.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.500
Where--where are you guys all from?

08:15.500 --> 08:17.300
You guys are from different places,
am I right?

08:17.300 --> 08:18.600
Brazil?

08:18.600 --> 08:20.033
Japan.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.600
Venezuela.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.600
Venezuela, wow.

08:21.600 --> 08:22.600
Korea.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.267
You guys are "world of dance",
like, right?

08:25.267 --> 08:26.967
Like--like...

08:30.500 --> 08:32.100
The acrobatics, the physicality,

08:32.100 --> 08:34.600
the musicality and also
the synchronicity,

08:34.600 --> 08:37.033
those alpha kicks, you guys are
perfectly in sync together.

08:37.033 --> 08:38.033
I was like, "Dang."

08:39.299 --> 08:40.567
Great job, guys.
Great job.

08:42.400 --> 08:45.300
It is now time for us
to lock in our scores.

08:45.300 --> 08:48.100
We're judging on performance,
technique, choreography,

08:48.100 --> 08:50.333
creativity, and presentation.

08:50.333 --> 08:51.433
- Let's do it. Let's do it.
- All right, let's do it.

08:58.167 --> 08:59.933
All right, guys, if you get
less than 80 points,

08:59.933 --> 09:02.233
you won't be going through.

09:02.233 --> 09:03.533
Super Cr3w, let's see if
you made it through.

09:03.533 --> 09:04.533
Here we go.

09:22.100 --> 09:24.167
Whoo!

09:25.867 --> 09:27.967
Congratulations. You are going
through to the next round.

09:27.967 --> 09:28.967
We'll see you there.

09:32.633 --> 09:34.633
All right, way to set the bar.
Come on.

09:34.633 --> 09:37.367
You just performed so well.
I mean, so unbelievable.

09:37.367 --> 09:38.567
You couldn't have done that any better.

09:38.567 --> 09:41.100
We've done it for a long time,
and I think the time

09:41.100 --> 09:43.100
- is now, and this is our year.
- This is it.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.333
- Yeah.
- Vision board it together.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.433
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, visualize.
- Whoo.

09:46.433 --> 09:48.100
- Visualize.
- So happy.

09:48.100 --> 09:49.433
- Yeah.
- All right, we're good now.

09:49.433 --> 09:50.700
All right, it's happening.

09:50.700 --> 09:51.867
- Yeah, it's happening.
- All right, yeah, yeah.

09:51.867 --> 09:52.933
We got it.

09:52.933 --> 09:54.033
Yeah.

10:00.833 --> 10:02.833
Whoo!

10:02.833 --> 10:04.467
Wait, you can't be done.

10:04.467 --> 10:06.367
There has to be more.

10:06.367 --> 10:08.000
Use those hips a little bit more.

10:11.733 --> 10:14.000
That is the power of synchronicity.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.533
That is the power of movement.

10:18.200 --> 10:22.200
You inspire people,
and you inspire me as well.

10:32.733 --> 10:33.400
I love the way that this is set up.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.500
I might not have thought about
the transitions

10:35.500 --> 10:37.000
or the musicality; I might not
have thought about it.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.767
The cleanliness, the dynamics.

10:39.767 --> 10:42.933
Judging a tapper against
a contemporary dancer,

10:42.933 --> 10:44.000
it's so different.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.867
It helps us that we have these
five main categories.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.867
Performance, technique,
choreography,

10:52.867 --> 10:55.933
presentation, and creativity.

10:55.933 --> 10:58.233
Each criteria is worth 20 points.

10:58.233 --> 10:59.800
And between the five of them,

10:59.800 --> 11:01.600
the best score you can possibly
get is 100.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.367
And for the first round,
they have to

11:03.367 --> 11:05.700
at least get an 80 to go through.

11:05.700 --> 11:08.967
- Ready?
- Let's go!

11:11.467 --> 11:13.233
My name is D'Angelo,
and I'm 16 years old.

11:13.233 --> 11:15.367
My name is Amanda,
and I'm 17 years old.

11:15.367 --> 11:16.933
And we're ballroom dancers
from Miami, Florida.

11:16.933 --> 11:20.033
We've been dancing for ten years together

11:20.033 --> 11:21.867
since I was seven and he was six...

11:21.867 --> 11:23.233
Oh, you said forward before I step back.

11:23.233 --> 11:24.933
Amanda, after, after, after.

11:24.933 --> 11:26.933
Which is a very long time.

11:26.933 --> 11:28.667
- Yeah, I'm right again.
- Oh, wow, look at that.

11:28.667 --> 11:30.100
Well, I was--mm.

11:30.100 --> 11:32.900
We go to the same school,
so I'm, like,

11:32.900 --> 11:34.767
I'm with you 24-7.

11:34.767 --> 11:37.567
Tha, and hup, and one.

11:37.567 --> 11:42.633
Manny's our choreographer,
teacher, mentor, dictator...

11:42.633 --> 11:44.133
Hold it. Shape.

11:44.133 --> 11:45.467
Shape, shape, shape, shape.

11:45.467 --> 11:47.000
And he's also my dad.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Hup.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.600
If you know you have to spot, spot.

11:49.600 --> 11:52.400
When he's thinking, he'll be like this.

11:52.400 --> 11:53.867
And then he'll go...

11:57.633 --> 12:01.033
Manny pushes us very hard,
but at the end of the day,

12:01.033 --> 12:02.736
we do it because we love it.

12:03.374 --> 12:05.976
- __
- If we won?

12:06.002 --> 12:07.321
Ooh.

12:07.367 --> 12:08.933
I was just trying to think about
getting to the next round.

12:08.933 --> 12:10.900
I wasn't even trying to think
about winning.

12:10.900 --> 12:15.733
Please welcome D'Angelo and Amanda.

12:19.533 --> 12:22.267
Whoo.

12:24.233 --> 12:26.133
- Yes.
- That is my boy.

13:22.700 --> 13:24.567
Oh!

13:56.067 --> 13:58.600
Whoo!

13:58.600 --> 14:02.100
Wait a minute.

14:02.100 --> 14:03.867
- These are juniors.
- Yeah.

14:04.933 --> 14:07.500
All right, you know,

14:07.500 --> 14:09.100
me coming from a ballroom
and latin background,

14:09.100 --> 14:11.200
I just have to say, yeah, guys.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.667
What up?

14:14.433 --> 14:15.700
Way to represent.

14:15.700 --> 14:18.900
First of all, I saw paso doble.
I saw cha-cha in there.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.165
I even saw, like, a little jive action.

14:21.387 --> 14:22.467
Very, very cool, and also,

14:22.467 --> 14:25.467
for ballroom dancers, don't
normally have that extension

14:25.467 --> 14:27.233
- that you have.
- Yeah.

14:27.233 --> 14:30.633
Just make sure just to use
those hips a little bit more,

14:30.633 --> 14:33.633
'cause, like, I felt like he in
some of those moments

14:33.633 --> 14:35.900
overpowered you from a
rhythmical standpoint.

14:35.900 --> 14:38.133
I was about to demonstrate,
but I'm not going to; I got shy.

14:38.133 --> 14:39.200
- Please do.
- But...

14:39.200 --> 14:40.467
Come on.
Show 'em what you mean.

14:40.467 --> 14:41.700
Well, okay. Well, I mean,
I was like...

14:43.333 --> 14:44.300
It just needs, like....

14:46.300 --> 14:48.367
It just needs, like, a little,
like, boom there, you know.

14:50.967 --> 14:53.600
But overall, great job,
and what we just witnessed

14:53.600 --> 14:56.233
was a possible routine for
that million dollars.

14:56.233 --> 14:57.367
It was great.

14:57.367 --> 14:59.200
Amazing.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.367
How long did you guys rehearse for this?

15:01.367 --> 15:04.267
Because it was pretty flawless.

15:04.267 --> 15:06.067
Me and Amanda have been partnering
together for, like,

15:06.067 --> 15:09.633
over ten years, so
I've known her since, like,

15:09.633 --> 15:10.633
I came out the womb.

15:10.633 --> 15:13.100
Yeah.

15:13.100 --> 15:15.533
You guys obviously have a connection.

15:15.533 --> 15:17.133
There's a lot of trust there.

15:17.133 --> 15:21.367
It was a very tight, clean performance.

15:21.367 --> 15:22.767
Really, really amazing job.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.100
This was definitely
a standard-setting performance

15:26.100 --> 15:27.300
for me, definitely so.

15:27.300 --> 15:30.200
There's a certain criteria as to
what needs to happen

15:30.200 --> 15:31.533
in order to win this competition,

15:31.533 --> 15:34.700
and when I say every single
thing on this list

15:34.700 --> 15:36.967
y'all have in spades, and so
you definitely have

15:36.967 --> 15:39.467
what it takes to win.

15:39.467 --> 15:40.400
All right, should we lock it in?

15:40.400 --> 15:41.667
- Let's lock it in, guys.
- Let's do it.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.533
To make through the qualifier,

15:44.533 --> 15:48.467
you need to get an average score
of 80 or above.

15:48.467 --> 15:50.233
All right, let's see if you guys
are going through.

16:08.800 --> 16:10.700
Congratulations.

16:17.133 --> 16:20.167
From the second they came out
to the second they left, in.

16:20.167 --> 16:21.567
They was in the whole time.

16:31.167 --> 16:33.933
Amazing.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.567
Ohh, rough start.

16:43.567 --> 16:46.900
This crew is what this
competition is about.

16:46.900 --> 16:48.867
This is just a testament to
the fact that

16:48.867 --> 16:50.433
the best dancers in the world
are here tonight.

16:59.333 --> 17:01.233
And five, six, seven...

17:07.733 --> 17:08.967
Ohh.

17:19.367 --> 17:21.067
What is it like being twins?

17:32.333 --> 17:33.433
Ahh.

17:33.433 --> 17:36.500
Who's more fun?

17:37.700 --> 17:39.800
Yaah!

17:39.800 --> 17:41.067
Yaah!

18:12.533 --> 18:15.233
Les Twins, they are living legends.

18:15.233 --> 18:17.467
Being around them makes me
want to just step up my game.

18:30.733 --> 18:33.833
Next onstage, it's Les Twins!

18:38.233 --> 18:39.900
Yes.

18:39.900 --> 18:43.486
That's how you walk--that's
how you come out, man.

18:47.100 --> 18:48.133
Yes.

20:43.533 --> 20:45.267
So good.

20:47.700 --> 20:49.400
Super clean.

20:49.400 --> 20:52.133
Every hit super sharp.

20:52.133 --> 20:54.740
I'm familiar with you guys' work.

20:54.746 --> 20:57.343
This was a little more emotional
than I've seen you.

20:57.481 --> 21:01.398
- Like, is there a story behind...
- Yes, I have a girl named

21:01.475 --> 21:03.000
Jessica.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.767
And this girl left me.

21:05.900 --> 21:08.133
And it's actually this woman
being--supporting me

21:08.133 --> 21:11.067
when I had nothing,
and when I came to here.

21:12.800 --> 21:15.033
Hey, come on, man.

21:15.033 --> 21:17.533
Whatever. She left me,
and that day I was...

21:21.300 --> 21:23.000
Come on, bro.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.668
This is just a testament to
the fact that the best dancers

21:33.806 --> 21:35.003
in the world are here tonight.

21:37.994 --> 21:39.322
I'm a big fan of you guys.

21:39.904 --> 21:41.525
Your style is so unique.

21:41.913 --> 21:44.653
But the fact that you're twins--
I have twins; you know this.

21:44.820 --> 21:45.646
- Oh, of course, we do.
- Yes, but--

21:45.911 --> 21:47.428
I didn't know about it.

21:47.805 --> 21:49.586
You were too busy with Jessica, okay?

21:50.033 --> 21:51.433
Ohh.

21:51.433 --> 21:54.200
It's that connection that you
have as twins, I think,

21:54.200 --> 21:57.733
that there will be nobody ever
like you guys ever again.

21:57.733 --> 22:01.469
This is something that is such a
beautiful thing to watch

22:01.567 --> 22:04.766
- in the world of dance.
- Thank you.

22:04.933 --> 22:07.700
You guys are able to create a world

22:07.700 --> 22:12.101
that everybody gets sucked into.
You know, that's how special

22:12.101 --> 22:15.968
your style is, to be able
to transport an audience,

22:16.205 --> 22:17.557
and that is an amazing thing to do.

22:17.729 --> 22:19.883
Wish you the best of luck.
You guys are amazing.

22:20.148 --> 22:20.567
Peace.

22:20.567 --> 22:22.267
All right, we ready to lock in?

22:22.267 --> 22:23.633
Yes.

22:24.230 --> 22:25.703
Lock in your score.

22:41.633 --> 22:42.800
Wow.

22:42.800 --> 22:47.237
We cannot wait to see what
the next level of Les Twin is.

22:47.415 --> 22:48.748
- You ain't ready for that.
- Cannot wait.

22:48.833 --> 22:50.037
I don't think they're ready for this.

23:02.367 --> 23:04.356
Whoo, yeah, there we go.

23:04.654 --> 23:06.147
That's a man-size shoe right there boys.

23:07.200 --> 23:10.293
We are NXT LVL, a clogging group
from all over America.

23:13.300 --> 23:15.200
- I love me some clogging.
- Yeah.

23:15.200 --> 23:16.533
I can't wait.
I used to clog.

23:16.533 --> 23:17.733
Can I clog with you a little bit?

23:17.733 --> 23:18.767
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

23:20.367 --> 23:21.867
Whoo.

23:25.700 --> 23:29.067
This is nine of the truly most
talented male cloggers

23:29.067 --> 23:30.133
you could ever find.

23:30.133 --> 23:32.367
We actually have our own show,
"Thunder & Light,"

23:32.367 --> 23:35.167
at the Calvin Gilmore Theater
in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

23:35.167 --> 23:38.067
So when we hit the stage,
we take it to the next level.

23:38.067 --> 23:39.133
And that's what this is all about.

23:39.133 --> 23:42.133
Go, go, go, go, go.

23:42.133 --> 23:44.367
Whoo!

23:44.367 --> 23:48.333
Next onstage, it's NXT LVL.

24:24.133 --> 24:25.500
You guys seem like a group of guys that

24:25.500 --> 24:26.767
I'd want to go grab a beer with.

24:26.767 --> 24:27.767
Like, for real.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.733
Hey, I'm telling you.

24:29.733 --> 24:32.500
You guys' footwork was amazing;
it was fantastic.

24:32.500 --> 24:33.967
- Those over the tops...
- Yes, sir.

24:33.967 --> 24:36.267
Where you guys were holding
the feet and going over the top,

24:36.267 --> 24:37.267
Whoo, that was slick.

24:37.267 --> 24:40.100
I loved it.

24:40.100 --> 24:41.900
You guys are definitely not
what I pictured

24:41.900 --> 24:43.767
when I heard "clogging,"
which is a great thing.

24:44.967 --> 24:46.800
And you're definitely taking
clogging to the next level.

24:46.800 --> 24:49.300
But I'm thinking about
the criteria here,

24:49.300 --> 24:51.967
and I just--I personally, again,
just needed a little more.

24:51.967 --> 24:53.733
So you've got to bring it all out.

24:54.900 --> 24:59.067
That was very clean for the
intricacy of what you guys

24:59.067 --> 25:00.200
- are doing with the clogging...
- Thank you so much.

25:00.200 --> 25:01.267
- Thank you so much.
- And everything.

25:01.267 --> 25:02.933
- It was really, really great.
- Thank you.

25:04.233 --> 25:06.433
You're obviously all great at what you do.

25:06.433 --> 25:09.000
This is a type of dancing that
could get a little bit

25:09.000 --> 25:12.300
repetitive after a while,
but you actually did create

25:12.300 --> 25:14.767
a dynamic routine.

25:14.767 --> 25:18.033
Is it at that level where I feel
like you guys could take

25:18.033 --> 25:19.767
the whole competition?
I'm not sure.

25:19.767 --> 25:21.533
We'll see if you make through
the next round,

25:21.533 --> 25:25.467
and maybe you can up the routine
ideas a little bit, you know.

25:25.467 --> 25:27.000
- Time to lock in scores.
- Here we go.

25:44.567 --> 25:45.967
Hey, let's go grab that drink,
though, all right.

25:49.733 --> 25:51.367
- They're good but...
- They didn't have that thing.

25:51.367 --> 25:52.700
They won't be--
they won't be competitive.

25:52.700 --> 25:55.967
They needed just a little more oomph.

26:01.533 --> 26:03.400
- Ready?
- I'm ready.

26:03.400 --> 26:04.300
I'm Keone.

26:04.300 --> 26:06.067
And I'm Mari.

26:06.067 --> 26:08.700
And we've been married
for four years.

26:08.700 --> 26:12.067
We're both dancers,
choreographers.

26:12.067 --> 26:14.100
We're known for the videos
that we post.

26:14.100 --> 26:15.367
A lot of our videos have gone viral

26:15.367 --> 26:17.167
with one video having a billion views

26:17.167 --> 26:18.833
for Justin Bieber's "Love Yourself."

26:23.133 --> 26:25.567
I would say any couple that
can choreograph together

26:25.567 --> 26:28.467
and stay with each other, major props.

26:29.667 --> 26:32.667
We've gotten better at it over the years.

26:32.667 --> 26:34.967
We've gotten better,

26:34.967 --> 26:36.733
we like to think.

26:36.733 --> 26:39.400
Let's welcome Keone and Mari.

26:39.400 --> 26:42.400
"World of Dance" is a whole
different level completely.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.400
It's got the best of best,

26:44.400 --> 26:46.000
and we can't wait to be a part of it.

27:20.600 --> 27:21.733
Ahh.

28:06.033 --> 28:07.600
Ahh!

28:30.233 --> 28:31.633
Whoo!

28:31.633 --> 28:34.067
Keone and Mari.

28:34.067 --> 28:36.467
I didn't know that was planned
at the beginning.

28:36.467 --> 28:38.133
- Me either.
- I was like, "Ooh."

28:38.133 --> 28:40.133
- I was like, "Augh."
- But that's their genius.

28:40.133 --> 28:41.000
- You know what I mean?
- Rough start.

28:42.100 --> 28:43.933
You guys are so loveable, likeable.

28:43.933 --> 28:45.667
- And the musicality...
- Yeah.

28:45.667 --> 28:47.533
Those little, like,
"ba-da-da, da-da, da-da-da,"

28:47.533 --> 28:48.900
it's amazing;
it's incredible.

28:48.900 --> 28:50.333
- I love you guys.
- Thank you.

28:50.333 --> 28:52.633
And I can't wait to see more.

28:52.633 --> 28:53.900
- Thank you, Derek. Thank you.
- Thank you, Derek.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.600
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.200
You guys are married, right?

28:57.200 --> 28:59.733
- Yes.
- We are.

28:59.733 --> 29:02.623
In this particular number,
just the way you told the story

29:02.940 --> 29:03.367
of your life.

29:03.367 --> 29:05.767
You start out, you know.
It could be clumsy.

29:05.767 --> 29:07.233
It could be weird.

29:07.233 --> 29:10.233
But then once you start dancing,
the world is perfect.

29:10.233 --> 29:11.967
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, Jennifer.

29:11.967 --> 29:14.067
Thank you.

29:14.067 --> 29:16.500
From the technicality to just
the passion, like,

29:16.500 --> 29:18.633
you can tell that you guys
really enjoy

29:18.633 --> 29:20.933
dancing with each other.

29:20.933 --> 29:23.300
All passion, all energy.

29:23.300 --> 29:25.200
Beautiful performance.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.933
- Thank you, Ne-Yo.
- Thank you.

29:26.933 --> 29:28.800
I want to ask you guys a question.

29:28.800 --> 29:31.067
What would winning this competition
mean to you?

29:31.067 --> 29:33.900
The obviously opportunity to
showcase yourself

29:33.900 --> 29:39.067
amongst the best dancers in
the world, but for us personally,

29:39.067 --> 29:41.367
we are so close to that point
of our lives

29:41.367 --> 29:42.467
where we want to start a family.

29:46.867 --> 29:48.800
- Look, I got the goosies.
- All right.

29:48.800 --> 29:51.067
- I got the goosies. Did you?
- I was like...

29:51.067 --> 29:52.967
- You were about to...
- I felt it.

29:52.967 --> 29:55.133
So I mean, I mean, obviously,
a million dollars would help.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.333
It's time for us to lock in our scores.

30:05.833 --> 30:08.467
Okay, let's see if
you're going through.

30:26.267 --> 30:27.267
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you.

30:29.733 --> 30:31.033
You got me on the family thing.

30:31.033 --> 30:32.900
- I was like...
- That was so cute.

30:32.900 --> 30:33.900
So adorable.

30:33.900 --> 30:36.167
Congratulations.

30:36.167 --> 30:38.033
Round two.
Here we go.

30:38.033 --> 30:39.900
Thanks to "World of Dance."

30:45.333 --> 30:46.500
It was like a movie.

30:46.500 --> 30:48.367
Every eye was, like, locked in.

30:48.367 --> 30:49.733
You've got that live fire.

30:49.733 --> 30:53.300
I can see it in you.

31:03.767 --> 31:04.867
One, two, three.

31:04.867 --> 31:07.167
We're the Kinjaz.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.533
Let's turn up our barbecue.

31:11.067 --> 31:12.167
We're the Kinjaz.

31:12.167 --> 31:14.100
We're a Los Angeles-based crew.

31:14.100 --> 31:15.500
A kin is our family.

31:15.500 --> 31:18.067
So this is a brotherhood of ninjas.

31:18.067 --> 31:19.667
Raise your hand if you were ever, like,

31:19.667 --> 31:22.567
a ninja for Halloween or
the Ninja Turtles or something.

31:24.833 --> 31:26.633
A lot of us did martial arts
when we were younger.

31:26.633 --> 31:30.033
And we just genuinely loved it.

31:30.033 --> 31:32.748
We're a really, really unique
and specific type of brotherhood.

31:33.067 --> 31:34.833
We go eat together.
We go to the movies together.

31:34.833 --> 31:38.233
We do a lot of great and not so
great things together.

31:38.233 --> 31:40.867
Ahh!

31:40.867 --> 31:42.567
Most of us are actually
second generation,

31:42.567 --> 31:45.033
which meant that our parents
immigrated over here.

31:45.033 --> 31:47.133
They picked up jobs, like,
running gas stations,

31:47.133 --> 31:48.767
to dry cleaners, to farming

31:48.767 --> 31:50.100
just to kind of give us an opportunity

31:50.100 --> 31:52.200
to follow out dreams, so we really
want to make them

31:52.200 --> 31:53.267
proud through this competition.

31:57.600 --> 32:00.367
Our style of dance is influenced

32:00.367 --> 32:01.600
by the ninja culture.

32:01.600 --> 32:04.367
We're literally drawing
inspiration from movies,

32:04.367 --> 32:07.367
from fantasy stories,
from anime,

32:07.367 --> 32:10.733
and it allows us to transform
into anything.

32:10.733 --> 32:11.933
But we're here to win.

32:11.933 --> 32:14.200
And we know that everybody else
is here to do the same.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.333
And that's what fires us up.

32:16.333 --> 32:20.900
Next to take the stage,
it's Kinjaz.

32:34.500 --> 32:36.600
Kinjaz.

32:39.300 --> 32:43.100
respect all, fear none.

34:12.067 --> 34:13.699
That was dope.

34:15.699 --> 34:17.400
Oh, my God.

34:20.199 --> 34:21.600
I'm kind of at a loss for words.

34:21.600 --> 34:23.766
Like, I'm just, like, "Whoo."

34:23.766 --> 34:27.000
Like, I was just doing that
the whole way through.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.367
Man, like, the opening was...
it was like a movie.

34:30.367 --> 34:31.400
It was just, like....

34:32.400 --> 34:33.699
"And I am..."
You know, it was--it was...

34:33.699 --> 34:35.800
It was so cool.

34:35.800 --> 34:38.199
Every movement was intended.

34:38.199 --> 34:40.467
Everything that you guys did was
very carefully thought through.

34:40.467 --> 34:41.699
You could see that.

34:41.699 --> 34:43.067
You are incredible at what you do.

34:43.067 --> 34:45.367
You did it perfectly.
So good.

34:48.833 --> 34:50.632
All day we've been talking
about the wow factor.

34:50.632 --> 34:52.333
We've been talking about dynamics.

34:52.333 --> 34:54.067
We've been talking about the bigness of it.

34:54.067 --> 34:58.900
You guys came out here
and  made fingers dynamic.

35:00.400 --> 35:02.533
I mean, how do you coordinate
fingers like this?

35:02.533 --> 35:03.933
A few hours.

35:03.933 --> 35:06.267
Yeah, a few hours of just,
"No, like this," yeah.

35:06.267 --> 35:07.767
"No, guys, one more.
One more time.

35:07.767 --> 35:09.167
"Nope, nope, one more time, nope."

35:09.167 --> 35:11.433
Yeah.

35:11.433 --> 35:15.133
You didn't need big, crazy
tricks to keep it interesting,

35:15.133 --> 35:17.133
and every eye was, like, locked in.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.800
That is the power of synchronicity.

35:19.800 --> 35:21.533
That is the power of movement.

35:21.533 --> 35:24.300
Keep going.
Keep elevating.

35:27.600 --> 35:32.100
I don't know.
For me, it just--it just...

35:32.100 --> 35:34.467
it wasn't enough.

35:37.167 --> 35:38.233
I want more.

35:39.700 --> 35:41.567
I want more.

35:41.567 --> 35:43.500
Can I have some more?

35:43.500 --> 35:44.867
It was too short.

35:44.867 --> 35:46.500
And I was like, "Wait."

35:46.500 --> 35:49.033
You can't be done.
There has to be more."

35:49.033 --> 35:51.233
It was so damn good.

35:51.233 --> 35:52.567
Wow.

35:52.567 --> 35:54.233
Thank you.

35:54.233 --> 35:56.833
I know when I perform with
certain people,

35:56.833 --> 35:58.633
we become one on stage.

35:58.633 --> 36:00.367
There's a unity that happens, like,

36:00.367 --> 36:01.833
your hearts and your souls unite,

36:01.833 --> 36:04.533
and I just feel like that's what
I love about you guys.

36:04.533 --> 36:06.833
I'd love to see even more of that.

36:06.833 --> 36:08.500
Thank you.

36:10.167 --> 36:12.033
All right, guys, ready?
Let's lock in our scores.

36:12.033 --> 36:13.600
Yep.

36:20.433 --> 36:21.900
- Okay, good?
- Okay, yep.

36:23.433 --> 36:25.233
Let's see if you guys made it through.

36:40.867 --> 36:42.067
Congratulations.

36:42.067 --> 36:43.633
You are through to the next round.

36:55.100 --> 36:56.500
Man, that was--that was fun.

36:56.500 --> 36:57.700
Yeah, I love the groups.

36:57.700 --> 36:59.533
- The groups are so fun.
- So fun.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.000
Coming up...

37:03.000 --> 37:05.433
It wasn't just all
the flexibility you had.

37:05.433 --> 37:06.900
It was the passion.

37:13.067 --> 37:13.333
Are you ready?

37:14.833 --> 37:16.167
I'm gonna do my best.

37:16.167 --> 37:18.000
Okay, you know what?

37:18.000 --> 37:19.833
Just dance with your heart.

37:19.833 --> 37:22.400
I believe in you.

37:22.400 --> 37:24.767
Okay.

37:24.767 --> 37:26.433
My name is Diana Pombo.

37:26.433 --> 37:27.933
I'm 11 years old.

37:27.933 --> 37:30.867
I am from Miami, Florida,
and I am a contemporary dancer.

37:30.867 --> 37:34.200
I've been naturally hyper since
the day I was born.

37:34.200 --> 37:35.633
And it hasn't changed.

37:35.633 --> 37:37.567
Calm down; you can't go out
there like that.

37:37.567 --> 37:38.967
Are you crazy?

37:38.967 --> 37:42.700
She danced in my tummy when
I was pregnant with her.

37:42.700 --> 37:46.733
And my tummy would actually just
do this wave, you know.

37:46.733 --> 37:49.767
She was always extremely active.

37:49.767 --> 37:52.300
My sister Andrea started
dancing before me,

37:52.300 --> 37:55.033
and since I was, like, four
I would watch her in recitals

37:55.033 --> 37:58.133
with her tutus, and
I would put on her tutus

37:58.133 --> 38:00.433
and start running around the house.

38:00.433 --> 38:02.267
And I haven't stopped.

38:02.267 --> 38:06.000
I am so proud of Diana being here.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.667
She's so brave.

38:07.667 --> 38:08.733
Did you ever think you would be
at this level

38:08.733 --> 38:09.900
of competition?

38:09.900 --> 38:11.667
No, this is a dream come true.

38:11.667 --> 38:12.767
- This is it.
- Okay.

38:12.767 --> 38:14.400
Go do the best job ever.

38:14.400 --> 38:15.667
It's your turn to shine.

38:15.667 --> 38:17.500
Love.

38:17.500 --> 38:22.167
This competition could change
my life forever.

38:22.167 --> 38:24.133
And I'm just, like, whoa.

38:27.100 --> 38:29.933
Look at this little munchkin.

38:33.167 --> 38:34.200
Hi.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.800
♪ I sing for love,

39:28.700 --> 39:31.800
I sing for me *

39:41.000 --> 39:44.133
Ahh! Oh, my God.

39:58.100 --> 40:00.700
She's incredible.

40:02.033 --> 40:03.133
Man.

40:03.133 --> 40:04.833
- Diana...
- Whoo-hoo-hoo.

40:04.833 --> 40:06.167
Where are you from?

40:06.167 --> 40:07.333
Miami, Florida.

40:07.333 --> 40:09.167
Miami, Florida. What's your background?

40:09.167 --> 40:10.800
Well, my parents are from Colombia.

40:10.800 --> 40:12.800
Yes, you've got that live fire.

40:12.800 --> 40:14.733
- I can see it in you.
- Thank you.

40:14.733 --> 40:19.738
When you took your foot and
looked at me backwards

40:20.487 --> 40:22.828
and wiped your forehead
with your foot...

40:24.100 --> 40:28.800
And looked like your face
was going to cry, I...

40:29.633 --> 40:31.033
She--she's--she's pumped.

40:31.033 --> 40:34.733
I--no, it wasn't just all
the flexibility you had.

40:34.733 --> 40:35.933
It wasn't all the strength you had.

40:35.933 --> 40:39.700
It was the passion that you put
into every move.

40:40.867 --> 40:43.567
Thank you.

40:43.567 --> 40:45.000
It was incredible.
I mean, I'm looking at

40:45.000 --> 40:46.567
the scoreboard right here, and
it says "performance,

40:46.567 --> 40:49.233
technique, choreography,
creativity, presentation,"

40:49.233 --> 40:50.433
- I mean, you...
- Thank you.

40:50.433 --> 40:51.967
You check all those boxes.
Just fantastic.

40:51.967 --> 40:53.167
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

40:54.800 --> 40:57.067
For me, it's never so much
about the five and six

40:57.067 --> 40:58.100
and seven and eight of it.

40:58.100 --> 41:00.667
It's always about how it feels
and the passion.

41:00.667 --> 41:02.433
You are all passion,

41:02.433 --> 41:03.500
which is a very, very good thing.

41:05.633 --> 41:07.967
I almost--I--I almost got--
you almost got me.

41:07.967 --> 41:10.200
You almost got me.

41:10.200 --> 41:11.833
- Quality work.
- Thank you so much.

41:11.833 --> 41:13.967
Quality.

41:13.967 --> 41:18.333
Miss JLo, I just want to say
that you are my idol.

41:18.333 --> 41:19.567
Oh, don't make me cry.

41:19.567 --> 41:23.533
You inspire people, and
you inspire me as well.

41:23.533 --> 41:27.333
- Oh, my God, baby.
- Thank you so much.

41:37.033 --> 41:38.567
Thank you.

41:38.567 --> 41:41.200
You did such a beautiful job.
Honestly.

41:41.200 --> 41:42.533
You're a very special little girl.

41:42.533 --> 41:44.933
- Thank you.
- You hear me?

41:53.233 --> 41:54.633
Shall we lock in our scores?

41:54.633 --> 41:56.400
- Let's do it.
- Let's lock it in.

42:07.300 --> 42:08.600
Let's see if you're going through.

42:26.467 --> 42:29.200
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

42:29.200 --> 42:30.600
You're going through.
Congratulations. Amazing.

42:30.600 --> 42:32.067
- Congratulations, baby.
- Congrats.

42:32.067 --> 42:34.433
Thank you so much.

42:42.033 --> 42:43.800
Ohh.

42:46.233 --> 42:49.100
Now I'm all emotional over here too.

42:49.100 --> 42:51.733
Oh, and meeting your idol.

42:51.733 --> 42:53.033
- That was insane.
- And you got kissed.

42:53.033 --> 42:54.200
Look at this kiss.

42:54.200 --> 42:57.133
It's like a beautiful, perfect
Jennifer kiss.

42:57.133 --> 42:58.033
- Yes.
- Ohh.

42:58.033 --> 43:00.033
This is a dream come true.

43:00.033 --> 43:01.633
Ohh, you guys.

43:01.633 --> 43:02.404
Thank you.

43:02.867 --> 43:03.548
Yes.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.133
She did it.
