02:02.500 --> 02:04.961
Help!

02:15.640 --> 02:18.894
It's not what you think.

02:26.568 --> 02:30.365
Well, it's partly what you think,
but, er...

02:30.531 --> 02:33.368
Oh, it's so complicated.

03:35.147 --> 03:39.985
Oh, God, help me! Please!
You can't be the man I'm about to marry.

03:40.152 --> 03:44.282
Don't tell me that my fiancé is...
that my fiancé is a...

03:46.451 --> 03:51.499
Haunted Honeymoon, starring Larry Abbot,
will continue after this news update.

03:51.666 --> 03:58.589
Stay tuned for the chilling conclusion of this
week's tale from Manhattan Mystery Theatre.

03:58.756 --> 04:03.136
- Don't touch that dial. We'll be right back.
- You're off the air.

04:03.303 --> 04:06.391
OK, boys.
You've got two minutes. Go.

04:06.556 --> 04:12.814
Listen, pal, I'm not a boy and I don't want
to be referred to as one of the boys.

04:17.736 --> 04:22.033
Hey, hey, hey! Guys, guys! Gal...
One at a time, huh?

04:22.199 --> 04:25.412
- Are you two getting married Sunday?
- Only if it rains.

04:25.413 --> 04:27.603
I got tickets for the World Series.

04:27.664 --> 04:31.336
- When did he ask you?
- After strangling me in Curse of the Mummy.

04:31.503 --> 04:33.797
- Say yes right away?
- Bet your sweet patoot.

04:33.964 --> 04:36.966
- How do you spell "patoot"?
- Any way you like.

04:37.132 --> 04:42.015
You've been in lots of shows that went bust.
How's it feel to own a hit?

04:42.181 --> 04:44.768
I don't own her, I'm just marrying her.

04:44.933 --> 04:47.020
No, I mean the radio show.

04:47.186 --> 04:52.775
Sure, I'm on top of the world 'cause I got
the number one show. That's just luck.

04:52.944 --> 04:56.280
I'm head-over-heels in love
with the best girl in the world.

04:56.448 --> 04:58.867
That's not luck, that's God smiling on me.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.954
When Vickie said yes to me...

05:06.418 --> 05:09.420
From the minute Vickie said yes...

05:17.012 --> 05:21.642
He bought a double mattress and a new stove.

05:21.810 --> 05:27.565
- How's her cooking? Have you tasted it yet?
- Sure, but we're getting married anyway.

05:27.734 --> 05:30.986
- Vickie, how'd he ask you?
- Give us a break.

05:31.152 --> 05:35.533
Your fans love this stuff.
Come on, Vickie. Was he romantic?

05:35.700 --> 05:38.453
It was like in the movies.
Honest to God.

05:38.621 --> 05:40.872
We're walking along in the moonlight.

05:41.040 --> 05:44.334
He gets down on one knee,
looks at me and says...

05:46.045 --> 05:48.298
It's almost airtime, gentlemen.

05:48.465 --> 05:51.343
OK, boys, that's it.

05:51.509 --> 05:54.888
We're giving you
a page of coverage here.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.183
Give 'em a break, will ya?

05:59.852 --> 06:02.314
Can we have a level first violin, please?

06:02.480 --> 06:06.777
- Well, Larry's certainly in good form today.
- The show isn't over.

06:06.943 --> 06:11.491
- You can see he's fine today, Charlie.
- The show isn't over yet.

06:13.909 --> 06:16.747
Eddy, are you there? I don't see you.

06:18.457 --> 06:21.961
Could we hear
a little bit of the storm, please?

06:48.532 --> 06:50.618
That's fine, Eddy.

06:50.785 --> 06:54.039
Ten seconds, everyone.

06:54.204 --> 06:55.792
- Say, Eddy...
- Huh?

06:55.957 --> 06:58.586
- Is my tie straight?
- What?

06:58.751 --> 07:03.633
- My tie, is it straight?
- Your tie's fine.

07:03.800 --> 07:08.555
- No, but is it straight?
- Yeah, your tie is straight.

07:08.721 --> 07:13.228
- Say "I swear to God your tie is straight".
- I swear to God.

07:13.394 --> 07:14.980
- Thanks, Eddy.
- Sh!

07:18.315 --> 07:22.113
Ralston Purina Checkerboard Square,
makers of Purina Dog Chow, presents

07:22.279 --> 07:25.574
Manhattan Mystery Theatre.

07:25.741 --> 07:28.370
Hello again. Still there?

07:28.535 --> 07:31.247
This is your host speaking.

07:31.414 --> 07:36.295
And now, friends, brace yourselves
for the chilling conclusion...

07:36.462 --> 07:39.882
to tonight's tale of horror, entitled...

07:41.509 --> 07:45.097
Haunted Honeymoon.

07:49.350 --> 07:52.063
Lady Wolfington
is speaking on the telephone...

07:52.230 --> 07:55.400
to Inspector Carp of Scotland Yard.

07:55.567 --> 07:59.947
Inspector, I'm terrified.
I tell you, it's gone beyond all reason.

08:00.114 --> 08:05.119
Lady Wolfington, there's only one way to tell
if a man has werewolf in his blood.

08:05.286 --> 08:08.582
He'll give himself away
by stammering ever so slightly...

08:08.748 --> 08:10.584
on all words beginning with "w".

08:10.751 --> 08:12.252
"W"?

08:12.253 --> 08:18.384
If you suspect your fiancé, put him to the test.
I'll get there as soon as I can.

08:21.305 --> 08:23.849
Oh, Freddy, you startled me.

08:24.015 --> 08:25.579
Startled?

08:25.601 --> 08:27.895
- By me?
- Yes, I'm sorry, I...

08:28.061 --> 08:31.753
All words beginning with "w".

08:32.024 --> 08:35.696
All words beginning with "w".

08:36.780 --> 08:39.325
Darling, what a lovely sweater.

08:39.491 --> 08:41.578
Is that cotton or wool?

08:41.744 --> 08:44.373
This? Oh, it's woo... wool.

08:44.539 --> 08:47.042
- What?
- Um...

08:48.251 --> 08:52.131
I say, uh... I don't know.
Must be some sort of a cotton.

08:55.260 --> 08:58.431
Oh, I think another storm's brewing.

09:08.316 --> 09:11.654
Seems so. Doesn't it?

09:19.411 --> 09:22.833
- Listen to that wind.
- Ooh-hoo!

09:22.999 --> 09:26.671
Oh! It's frightening, isn't it?

09:27.796 --> 09:29.674
- Why's he laughing?
- I don't know.

09:29.840 --> 09:32.885
- Is that how you rehearsed it?
- No, but that's Larry.

09:36.932 --> 09:40.019
- Darling, I'm going to have a sherry.
- Oh!

09:40.184 --> 09:44.607
- Would you or wouldn't you like some?
- Oh, I wou... I wou...

09:44.774 --> 09:48.445
Um... yes, I'll have some.

09:53.284 --> 09:56.121
- Here's your drink, darling.
- Thanks. Cheers.

09:56.287 --> 09:59.750
- To Wolfington Castle.
- To Woo... Woo...

09:59.917 --> 10:02.043
To Woo-woo-woo...

10:03.753 --> 10:06.215
To Woo-woo-woo-woo...

10:06.381 --> 10:07.945
Woo-woo-woo...

10:09.176 --> 10:10.742
To Woo-woo-woo...

10:10.887 --> 10:13.807
Woo-woo... To Woo-woo-woo...

10:13.974 --> 10:18.938
To Woo-woo-woo-woo... Wolfington Castle.

10:30.866 --> 10:33.789
- He's out. He's fired.
- No!

10:35.581 --> 10:39.086
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Dr Paul Abbot.

10:39.252 --> 10:43.175
Oh, Doctor, thank God you're here.
Please come in.

10:43.341 --> 10:45.427
This is our sponsor, Mr Tarlow.

10:45.593 --> 10:49.056
Charlie, this is Larry's uncle,
the famous psychiatrist.

10:49.222 --> 10:52.602
- I asked him to come meet you.
- What's he laughing at?

10:52.767 --> 10:57.064
- This is a mystery, not a comedy.
- He's laughing because he's afraid.

10:57.231 --> 11:00.068
- Afraid?
- Tomorrow it might make him cry.

11:00.236 --> 11:03.614
That's what he did last week.
What's he afraid of?

11:03.615 --> 11:06.117
Thunder and lightning? A wind machine?

11:06.491 --> 11:10.706
We have that stuff every week.
Why now? We were number one!

11:10.871 --> 11:14.376
Because three weeks ago
he got engaged to be married.

11:14.542 --> 11:18.547
- The Curse of The Mummy.
- What's that got to do with it?

11:18.712 --> 11:21.759
The engagement has opened
a crack in his psyche,

11:21.927 --> 11:26.890
so hideous to Larry's mind
that he must lock it out.

11:27.055 --> 11:30.686
- But I do know that I can cure him.
- How?

11:32.187 --> 11:34.733
By scaring him...

11:34.899 --> 11:36.065
to death.

11:36.066 --> 11:40.948
- You want to scare him even more?
- How do you cure hiccups, Mr Tarlow?

11:41.114 --> 11:42.678
- Well, you...
- Listen...

11:42.783 --> 11:45.494
I've been working in Zurich
with a brilliant scientist...

11:45.661 --> 11:48.331
who has discovered
the cure for Larry's condition.

11:48.498 --> 11:55.005
Dr Strickland has proved the cure is to increase
the pressure of the fears, not lessen it.

11:55.173 --> 12:00.387
- Like going faster around a dangerous curve?
- Exactly.

12:00.552 --> 12:04.099
This weekend, starting tonight,
the entire Abbot family...

12:04.266 --> 12:07.978
is gathering for the wedding
at the estate of Larry's great-aunt.

12:08.145 --> 12:10.731
We have him in an ideal situation,

12:10.899 --> 12:14.486
a lonely estate, miles from anywhere.

12:16.320 --> 12:21.327
- Have you told Vickie?
- No, not Vickie, that'd be too risky.

12:21.493 --> 12:24.247
I'm afraid she couldn't be objective.

12:24.413 --> 12:26.667
Are you promising you can cure Larry?

12:26.833 --> 12:32.756
I, Paul Abbot, promise that
I can cure Larry within 36 hours.

12:32.924 --> 12:36.886
- Just by scaring him?
- By scaring him to death.

12:39.097 --> 12:45.187
I don't know. I can be feeling swell, then
something sets it off and I'm scared to death.

12:45.353 --> 12:48.733
So you acted nutty
for a few shows, so what?

12:48.899 --> 12:54.157
You're the best actor in New York,
with the hottest show, and you still got me.

12:54.323 --> 12:58.535
So, listen, cookie, if something scares you
before Sunday, just say,

12:58.702 --> 13:02.331
"Whoops, there goes my imagination again.
How do you like that?"

13:02.497 --> 13:04.062
You think that'll work?

13:04.166 --> 13:08.422
Always in all ways rely upon me...

13:13.720 --> 13:17.349
Whoops, there goes my imagination again.
How do you like that?

13:17.516 --> 13:21.854
That's my guy. Did you hear what the bug
said to the windshield?

13:22.020 --> 13:24.566
- What?
- That's me all over.

13:25.691 --> 13:29.362
Sweet.
Don't you get it? If a bug splattered...

13:29.529 --> 13:32.282
- Honey, is my tie straight?
- What?

13:32.447 --> 13:35.494
- Is my tie straight?
- Your tie's fine.

13:35.662 --> 13:39.082
- Yeah, but is it straight?
- Yeah, it's straight.

13:39.248 --> 13:40.811
Oh, good.

14:05.779 --> 14:10.326
Someone in this family is trying to kill me.

14:10.491 --> 14:14.205
What? You don't know what you're saying.

14:14.371 --> 14:20.170
Larry's the only one I trust.
Please give me the pen. I haven't much time.

14:20.336 --> 14:23.757
- They'll all be here any moment.
- I love you, Kate.

14:23.923 --> 14:27.636
I respect you as if you were my own mother.

14:27.804 --> 14:29.889
Oh...

14:30.765 --> 14:34.936
You're the dearest person I know.
I'd even die for you, Kate.

14:35.103 --> 14:39.942
But darling, never mind
that I'm a member of the family,

14:40.109 --> 14:43.446
before you sign,
there's one thing you haven't considered.

14:43.612 --> 14:47.826
- What's that?
- What if Larry dies before you do?

14:47.993 --> 14:54.208
If Larry should die, you can all share the money
equally, just as it was before.

14:54.375 --> 14:59.715
Francis, you're the only living person
that knows I've changed my will.

14:59.882 --> 15:05.096
If you ever tell anyone
may your soul rot in hell.

15:11.687 --> 15:15.942
What a cosy place for a wedding.
Who lived here before? Count Dracula?

15:16.107 --> 15:21.865
- Will you lay off that? I grew up here.
- No wonder you turned out so normal.

15:22.031 --> 15:26.537
- Hey, hey.
- Sorry. Must be delightful by daylight.

15:28.330 --> 15:33.128
- Run for it, sweetie. I'll get the bags.
- OK.

15:44.389 --> 15:48.896
Go on, honey, knock on the door.
I'll be right there.

16:17.929 --> 16:23.059
I'm... I'm engaged to Larry Abbot
and he... said he grew up here.

16:23.225 --> 16:26.771
Oh, you know... He...

16:26.939 --> 16:31.945
He was just... You know him, he says he...
Maybe I'm at the wrong house.

16:32.111 --> 16:34.239
I can come back, thank you.

16:34.405 --> 16:37.076
Sorry, honey.
Oh, I see you've already met.

16:37.242 --> 16:39.724
I am Pfister, the family butler.

16:39.725 --> 16:42.645
And I'm the little boy you used
to tuck into bed...

16:42.706 --> 16:46.920
and bring milk and cookies to
just before you kissed me good night.

16:47.086 --> 16:49.298
- Your name, please?
- My name?

16:49.464 --> 16:53.593
- Is he kidding?
- Come in, Mr Kidding. I'll take the bags.

16:53.762 --> 16:56.264
Won't you follow me, please?

16:56.429 --> 17:00.643
- Poor Pfister, his memory's going.
- I wish we were.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.275
This way, please.

17:08.736 --> 17:14.534
- Holy smokes. You grew up in this place?
- I learned to ride a bike in this room.

17:14.701 --> 17:19.873
- He gives me the willies.
- Be nice to him. He seems strange but he isn't.

17:20.039 --> 17:23.837
- What'll I talk about?
- Talk about a minute, that'll be enough.

17:24.002 --> 17:28.008
Be very careful
of that magnificent vase on the landing.

17:28.174 --> 17:31.929
There are only three like it
in the entire world.

17:32.095 --> 17:34.600
Oh, what kind is it?

17:34.765 --> 17:37.602
Twenty-five past seven.

17:38.771 --> 17:41.816
- A little hard of hearing...
- What?

17:41.982 --> 17:46.529
- A little hard of hearing. It comes and goes.
- What?

17:46.695 --> 17:49.116
My fiancée, she's a little hard of hearing.

17:49.282 --> 17:50.909
- Come and goes, eh?
- Yes.

17:51.075 --> 17:54.705
I'll remember that.
This way, miss!

17:54.872 --> 17:56.958
This is gonna be some weekend.

18:13.727 --> 18:15.896
Toby! Toby, shush!

18:19.358 --> 18:22.111
Who is it? Who's there?

18:22.278 --> 18:24.989
What? Pfister!

18:25.156 --> 18:30.787
Why are these windows still open?
Do I have to do everything? Drunken sot!

18:30.953 --> 18:33.415
Hold your horses! Where's Pfister?

18:33.581 --> 18:37.378
Where is he? Oh, I'm coming, I'm coming.

18:43.177 --> 18:48.891
Who are you? What do you want?
This is just for the family. I don't know you.

18:49.058 --> 18:53.730
Why are you looking at me?
What do you want? Are you selling something?

19:03.240 --> 19:07.078
Oh, please, forgive me.

19:07.245 --> 19:12.585
Is there any way I can help you, sir?

19:12.751 --> 19:18.175
I'm Montego. My wife is Susan Abbot.
She should be here any moment.

19:18.342 --> 19:23.139
I came from Philadelphia by train.
I believe the family's expecting me.

19:23.306 --> 19:25.309
Won't you come in?

19:38.197 --> 19:42.327
- Have you got any luggage, sir?
- Just this one case.

19:42.493 --> 19:45.206
Oh, it's a large one, isn't it?

19:45.372 --> 19:48.292
Would you like me to...?

19:49.418 --> 19:53.632
I prefer to handle it myself, thank you.

20:13.070 --> 20:16.824
Now if anything frightens you,
anything at all, you just holler.

20:16.992 --> 20:20.453
- I'll be right down the hall, OK?
- OK.

20:34.386 --> 20:37.014
Just practising.

20:41.018 --> 20:43.062
I love you, cookie.

20:43.228 --> 20:46.817
- See you in 20 minutes.
- OK.

20:46.983 --> 20:48.548
Da-da-da

20:49.361 --> 20:52.615
- Master Larry!
- Pfister, you do remember me.

20:52.781 --> 20:58.080
- Of course. When did you get here?
- About 15 minutes ago.

20:58.246 --> 21:00.541
If I'd known, I'd have greeted you.

21:00.707 --> 21:04.921
Yes, that would have been nice.
Well, we can't have everything.

21:05.086 --> 21:08.008
- Come along, you're in your old room.
- Oh, good.

21:09.093 --> 21:14.056
- So what do you think, honey?
- Wow, what a snazzy little nook.

21:14.221 --> 21:17.935
Rachel, Rachel,
you're a sight for sore eyes, baby.

21:18.101 --> 21:21.147
Oh, Rachel...

21:23.358 --> 21:28.155
- She usually plants a big, wet one on me.
- I do not!

21:28.322 --> 21:30.324
She must be shy.

21:30.492 --> 21:36.498
Rachel, I'd like you to meet a very old friend
of mine from school, Sylvia Beecham.

21:36.665 --> 21:38.376
Pleased to meet you, Rachel.

21:38.542 --> 21:42.046
Rachel, you look wonderful.
Not a day over seventy...

21:42.213 --> 21:46.135
- three? Four? Seventy-five... Six. Oh, Rachel.
- You need a haircut.

21:46.300 --> 21:49.764
Oh, same old Rachel.
Love you, baby, love you.

21:49.930 --> 21:52.600
- Where's Larry?
- He's upstairs.

21:52.766 --> 21:57.480
Come on, I'll take you
on the grand tour, huh?

22:04.614 --> 22:08.243
Rachel, did you get the note
about the connecting rooms?

22:08.409 --> 22:12.163
- What? What's that?
- I knew that would get to her.

22:17.878 --> 22:22.007
If you don't mind me saying,
your uncle Francis is a strange man.

22:22.176 --> 22:25.470
You're telling me.
He scared me to death as a kid.

22:25.636 --> 22:27.806
- Is he still married?
- Widower.

22:27.972 --> 22:30.267
- Widower than what?
- What do you mean?

22:30.434 --> 22:32.895
- You said he was widower.
- He is.

22:33.063 --> 22:35.399
Widower than what?

22:35.564 --> 22:37.860
What?
He isn't widower than anything.

22:38.026 --> 22:40.321
- He's just a "wittle" man?
- That's right.

22:40.486 --> 22:43.282
That's all I was asking.

22:45.785 --> 22:47.955
I see.

22:49.956 --> 22:53.084
Well, the old room
looks just about the same.

22:53.251 --> 22:55.170
Nothing's changed since you left, sir.

22:55.337 --> 22:58.966
- Rachel still cleaning up?
- Never stops, sir.

22:59.134 --> 23:03.221
- I'd like to see Aunt Kate before dinner.
- I beg your pardon, sir.

23:03.388 --> 23:05.891
Your Aunt Kate has just
concluded some business

23:06.057 --> 23:09.938
and asked to be excused
until the family assemble downstairs.

23:10.104 --> 23:12.273
Ah... OK.

23:12.440 --> 23:15.026
Well, it's lovely
to see you again, Pfister.

23:15.193 --> 23:18.322
It's lovelier to see you, sir.

23:25.120 --> 23:26.685
Ah.

24:45.337 --> 24:48.049
Holy baloney, here we go again.

24:48.215 --> 24:50.426
Coming, darling.

24:57.099 --> 24:59.229
Coming, Larry.

24:59.395 --> 25:02.106
- Did you hear it, too?
- It's my fiancé.

25:02.272 --> 25:04.234
Hello, I'm Larry's uncle.

25:04.399 --> 25:06.195
- Hello.
- Hello, how are you?

25:06.361 --> 25:08.154
- Fine.
- Can I help you?

25:08.322 --> 25:12.160
I'm sure it's nothing.
He's just been nervous about the wedding.

25:12.326 --> 25:15.664
Look, why don't I go in with you?

25:19.626 --> 25:21.629
Larry?

25:21.795 --> 25:25.425
Honey? Where are you?

25:27.342 --> 25:29.012
Larry?

25:29.554 --> 25:34.226
Don't be afraid. The lightning's all gone.

25:37.689 --> 25:40.358
He can't just have vanished.

25:40.525 --> 25:46.699
- Larry?
- Don't move. You're risking your lives.

25:46.865 --> 25:51.913
Don't even raise your voices.
There's a deadly snake in that closet.

25:52.079 --> 25:56.292
Call the zoo. Ask them
if they're missing a seven-foot cobra.

25:56.460 --> 25:58.796
- Larry, I don't think...
- Don't argue.

25:58.962 --> 26:00.526
- Hey, steady!
- Honey...

26:00.589 --> 26:03.593
Larry, I'll take a look in the closet.

26:03.760 --> 26:07.096
No, no, listen to me. Call the zoo.

26:07.263 --> 26:10.684
- Where'd you see the snake?
- In the top drawer.

26:10.851 --> 26:14.856
I know my cobras.
You'll be dead within seconds.

26:17.525 --> 26:20.487
Is this your snake?

26:20.654 --> 26:26.076
By the way, Uncle Francis, I'd like you
to meet my fiancée, Vickie Pearle.

26:26.242 --> 26:28.663
Vickie, this is my...

26:31.583 --> 26:33.293
Uncle Francis.

26:51.814 --> 26:57.528
- Your mommy and daddy are right next door.
- Makes it more exciting.

26:57.697 --> 27:02.159
But supposing they walk in and see us,
how would I look?

27:03.661 --> 27:05.330
Like a million bucks.

27:05.496 --> 27:08.208
Charlie, why do you reduce everything
to money?

27:08.374 --> 27:11.003
Because I don't have any.

27:11.168 --> 27:18.364
- But I'd be happy if you only had 100 dollars.
- So would I.

27:19.095 --> 27:25.769
Listen, I can't take much more of this.
Either marry me, or let's call it quits.

27:25.936 --> 27:30.484
I can't afford to marry you. Not yet.

27:31.902 --> 27:34.612
And don't threaten me, honey.

27:34.779 --> 27:39.577
- I need a little more time.
- I may not wait around, Charlie.

27:39.742 --> 27:45.000
Did you hear me, Charlie?
I said I may not wait around.

27:48.878 --> 27:52.341
We'll talk about it at the end of the week.

27:59.849 --> 28:04.605
What? Drinking! Don't think I didn't see you.

28:04.771 --> 28:09.777
You'd better be sober tonight
or you don't get into my bed.

28:09.945 --> 28:13.740
See who's at the door. Hurry!

28:13.906 --> 28:18.078
Do I have to do everything? Drunken sot!

28:28.132 --> 28:29.800
- Hello, Pfister.
- Ma'am.

28:29.967 --> 28:34.222
- Boy, it's cold out there. Everyone here?
- You're the last one, Miss Susan.

28:34.389 --> 28:37.977
Hello, Toby. What's the matter?

28:38.142 --> 28:40.270
Aren't you going to say hello?

28:40.438 --> 28:43.191
Come on, boy.
Say hello to Aunt Susan.

28:43.356 --> 28:47.111
You remember me, don't you? Good boy.

28:48.153 --> 28:52.577
I know you love me.

28:55.370 --> 28:57.665
- I'll have a whisky and soda.
- Certainly.

28:57.832 --> 29:01.252
- Is my husband upstairs?
- Yes, Miss Susan.

29:01.418 --> 29:03.797
There's a bag in the car.
You can get it later.

29:03.798 --> 29:05.675
Very well.

29:15.852 --> 29:17.979
- Larry, wow! Come to mama.
- Sylvia.

29:18.146 --> 29:20.608
Oh, darling!

29:22.443 --> 29:26.448
- What are you doing here?
- Can't speak now. See you later.

29:26.614 --> 29:31.788
- Honey, I was just coming to get you.
- Am I glad to see you.

29:31.953 --> 29:35.833
- Yikes. Who's been kissing you?
- Oh, Rachel.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.338
- Who's Rachel?
- Pfister's wife. She went crazy.

29:39.503 --> 29:42.090
She was so happy she started kissing me.

29:42.257 --> 29:45.928
Well, this is some colour.
She must be quite a hot tamale.

29:46.095 --> 29:50.433
She is, but you'd never think it.
She's just a little thing.

29:58.483 --> 30:01.529
Rachel! We were just talking about you.

30:01.696 --> 30:04.241
- This is Rachel.
- How do you do?

30:04.408 --> 30:08.995
"As ye sow, so shall ye reap".

30:13.417 --> 30:14.584
Oh!

30:14.585 --> 30:18.257
Stop that! You're gonna get me
in trouble with my fiancée.

30:18.423 --> 30:22.928
It's sad, really. She just can't
keep her hands off of men.

30:24.681 --> 30:28.018
- How do I look?
- "Boffo socko", according to Variety.

30:28.183 --> 30:30.104
"Montego Magic Spells Dollars".

30:30.269 --> 30:33.440
- Hmm. How much did we make?
- 12,000.

30:33.608 --> 30:38.738
- Did you gamble this week?
- 'Fraid so. You look beautiful in that gown.

30:38.904 --> 30:41.490
- How much did we lose?
- 14.

30:41.659 --> 30:46.205
- This can't go on, Monty.
- I know, darling. I know.

30:46.372 --> 30:49.083
- What's that?
- Diamond necklace.

30:49.251 --> 30:51.337
- Where did you get it?
- Magic.

30:51.503 --> 30:55.632
- It's lovely.
- Everything's gonna change, I promise.

30:55.797 --> 30:58.302
So long as you have faith in me.

30:58.468 --> 31:03.015
- You're a very persuasive man.
- It's all done with mirrors.

31:14.903 --> 31:16.781
Champagne?

31:16.947 --> 31:19.451
- Thank you, Pfister.
- Thank you, Pfister.

31:25.582 --> 31:27.146
Champagne?

31:32.466 --> 31:34.843
- Where's your son?
- I don't know.

31:35.010 --> 31:39.014
- He was supposed to be here.
- I hope this isn't a stupid prank.

31:39.181 --> 31:42.602
- I don't want anything to go wrong.
- Does Aunt Kate know?

31:42.768 --> 31:45.939
- What she needs to.
- You know what you're doing?

31:46.106 --> 31:49.485
Take care of your part,
I'll take care of mine.

31:49.652 --> 31:53.031
The Montego? You're kidding.
You're Montego the magician?

31:53.197 --> 31:55.617
- That's my husband.
- I don't believe it!

31:55.783 --> 31:59.663
You're kidding me!
Are you doing some magic tonight?

31:59.831 --> 32:04.543
- I always come prepared.
- You don't know what this means to me.

32:04.710 --> 32:11.803
- Since I was a little girl I used to dream...
- Sylvia, darling. Come here, please.

32:11.968 --> 32:16.808
- Larry, you remember your old girlfriend?
- Larry, wow! What a surprise.

32:16.974 --> 32:21.104
Sylvia, I didn't know you were going
with Charlie. What a surprise.

32:21.271 --> 32:23.524
- Wow.
- Sylvia, I'd like you to meet...

32:23.689 --> 32:26.193
- Champagne, miss?
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.

32:26.360 --> 32:29.530
- Sylvia...
- Champagne, miss?

32:29.696 --> 32:31.157
Thank you.

32:31.158 --> 32:33.348
Sylvia, I'd like you to meet my fiancée, Vickie.

32:33.409 --> 32:34.576
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:34.577 --> 32:38.123
- I love your lipstick. What's it called?
- Pink Passion.

32:38.290 --> 32:41.293
Oh, yeah.
Well, quit "passion" it around.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.023
What?

32:43.044 --> 32:45.257
- Has Larry been flirting with you?
- Charlie.

32:45.423 --> 32:47.842
- Charlie, I'm engaged.
- Larry, you want her back?

32:48.009 --> 32:50.472
- Charlie!
- I've got my own girl, Charlie.

32:50.638 --> 32:54.767
Just like the old days, cuz?
But we love each other, huh?

32:54.933 --> 32:57.563
Madam Katherine!

32:57.730 --> 33:01.234
This house is cursed!

33:10.243 --> 33:12.621
They were all godless here.

33:12.787 --> 33:16.541
They used to bring their women to this house,

33:16.709 --> 33:20.130
brazen, lolling creatures
with their silks and satins.

33:20.295 --> 33:24.218
Oh, they filled this house
with laughter and sin.

33:24.385 --> 33:27.513
Laughter and sin...

33:29.015 --> 33:33.227
Wicked, blasphemous men
with their painted women.

33:33.395 --> 33:36.982
They revelled in the joys of fleshly love.

33:37.148 --> 33:39.944
Oh, I can still,

33:40.110 --> 33:46.660
still hear the echoes of the past.
Oh, what memories!

33:50.788 --> 33:52.206
Hello, darling.

33:52.207 --> 33:54.960
Aunt Kate, this is my fiancée, Vickie.

33:55.127 --> 33:59.341
- How do you do, Aunt Kate?
- Oh, charming. Charming.

33:59.507 --> 34:02.469
I'm starved. Let's eat.

34:02.636 --> 34:05.806
I want you next to me during dinner.

34:11.187 --> 34:16.527
Oh, you remind me of me
when I was a little girl.

34:17.610 --> 34:20.991
You're a good girl.
I can see it in your eyes.

34:21.157 --> 34:24.495
Not like the others. He's chosen wisely.

34:24.659 --> 34:28.331
- Thank you, Aunt Kate.
- You're welcome.

34:33.922 --> 34:36.757
I know that one of you is a werewolf.

34:43.600 --> 34:47.146
I saw you in the garden this afternoon.

34:58.115 --> 35:02.537
Don't be frightened, dear.
She's a little bit eccentric.

35:02.703 --> 35:05.874
Of course, I'm only speaking
to the Abbot family.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.548
My brother John, from whom
you are all descended,

35:11.714 --> 35:16.970
was bitten on the back of his neck
by something half animal, half human.

35:17.137 --> 35:21.726
From that moment on he was hairy all over.

35:22.809 --> 35:24.060
Oh.

35:24.061 --> 35:28.817
I had hoped all these years
that his disease would not be passed on,

35:28.983 --> 35:32.780
but now I see that it was.

35:35.533 --> 35:39.455
One of you is preying upon the fears
of an old woman.

35:39.621 --> 35:44.209
Whoever you are, may God strike you dead.

35:44.377 --> 35:47.881
Now let's have coffee and dessert
in the music room.

36:08.279 --> 36:11.741
Sh, Toby!

36:15.286 --> 36:19.709
Stop it now. Quiet!

36:23.505 --> 36:26.299
What's the matter with you?

36:26.466 --> 36:28.719
There's no one there.

36:30.805 --> 36:33.307
What's got into you?

36:37.979 --> 36:40.815
Marriage is a wonderful thing.

36:42.441 --> 36:44.611
My mother never...

36:47.323 --> 36:50.576
What I'm about to tell you...

36:50.742 --> 36:52.307
First...

36:54.163 --> 36:58.252
First, you put your two knees
close up tight.

37:00.170 --> 37:04.300
- You mean, you swing them to the left?
- Yes.

37:04.468 --> 37:07.762
- And then you swing them to the right?
- Oh, my dear...

37:07.929 --> 37:10.267
You step around the floor,

37:10.433 --> 37:13.061
kind of nice and light.

37:17.650 --> 37:18.815
One, two...

37:18.816 --> 37:23.030
And then you twist around
And twist around with all of your might

37:23.196 --> 37:26.992
Spread your lovin' arms
Clear out a space

37:27.159 --> 37:30.539
You do the eagle rock
With style and grace

37:30.706 --> 37:32.749
You put your left foot out

37:32.915 --> 37:34.480
And bring it back

37:34.501 --> 37:38.298
And that's what we call
"Ballin' the Jack"

38:25.683 --> 38:29.773
Spread

38:29.939 --> 38:33.193
Your lovin' arms way out in space

38:33.359 --> 38:36.363
Do the eagle rock with style and grace

38:36.528 --> 38:40.284
You put your left foot out
And bring it back

38:40.451 --> 38:43.788
And that's what we call
"Ballin' the Jack"

38:43.954 --> 38:48.293
And that's what we call

38:48.461 --> 38:51.046
Ball...

38:51.212 --> 38:53.632
"Ballin' the Jack"

38:54.925 --> 38:57.011
"Ballin' the Jack"

38:58.930 --> 39:00.766
"Ballin' the Jack"

39:22.456 --> 39:25.627
Oh, yes, port. Thank you, darling.

39:28.881 --> 39:30.446
Where's Francis Junior?

39:30.591 --> 39:34.053
I don't know, Kate. He said
he was coming this aftemoon.

39:34.221 --> 39:40.645
- I thought he'd be here for dinner.
- One of my dresses is missing.

39:40.811 --> 39:47.194
- Has he been at it again?
- No. No... I...

39:48.278 --> 39:53.993
My son does a wonderful impression
of Aunt Kate. He's got her voice to a T.

39:54.160 --> 39:58.874
And, well... Sometimes he likes to put on
one of Aunt Kate's dresses...

39:59.040 --> 40:02.127
- to entertain at family gatherings.
- I see.

40:02.295 --> 40:05.298
You should have seen him last Christmas.
Such fun!

40:05.464 --> 40:10.303
Yes. And when the police dragged him
out of the ladies' room at Saks Fifth Avenue,

40:10.468 --> 40:13.349
that was fun.

40:23.860 --> 40:26.321
- Power failure.
- Larry?

40:26.488 --> 40:28.053
- Here, honey.
- How exciting!

40:28.072 --> 40:30.243
- Who's got a lighter?
- What's that?

40:30.410 --> 40:32.119
Don't touch me!

40:32.285 --> 40:37.835
The lights have gone out, madam.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.921
Good old Pfister,
soon figured that one out.

40:44.340 --> 40:47.095
Electricity is the work of the devil.

40:48.512 --> 40:50.599
I don't trust it at all.

40:50.766 --> 40:53.519
God's paying me back for putting it in.

40:53.684 --> 40:57.899
- Come on, Kate. You can't live in the past.
- Oh, shut up.

40:58.066 --> 41:01.862
Why am I always being talked into things
I'll regret later?

41:02.027 --> 41:06.950
We should go to bed. We're going to be busy,
what with the wedding.

41:07.118 --> 41:11.247
- You ready to call it a night, Monty?
- Yes, I'm ready.

41:11.413 --> 41:13.376
- Francis?
- I'm ready.

41:13.541 --> 41:15.794
- Susan?
- I'm ready.

41:15.961 --> 41:20.925
- Charles?
- Oh, sure, Dad. Count me in, yeah.

41:21.092 --> 41:24.846
Sylvia, honey, you ready to go to bed?

41:25.930 --> 41:28.225
I sure am.

41:31.186 --> 41:35.108
- How about you, honey?
- Sure, yeah.

41:35.274 --> 41:40.197
- How about you, Pfister?
- I'm ready.

41:40.364 --> 41:45.036
Pfister, have arrangements been made
in case a blackout should last all night?

41:45.203 --> 41:48.999
Miss Rachel is upstairs now
lighting the candles, sir.

41:49.165 --> 41:54.213
Thank you for a lovely evening, Kate.
Shall we see you in the morning?

41:55.088 --> 42:00.470
Who knows if any of us
shall ever see the morning.

42:20.826 --> 42:23.246
Don't let that werewolf business frighten you.

42:23.412 --> 42:26.457
She's had werewolves on the brain
since we were kids.

42:26.623 --> 42:28.585
Wha!

42:28.750 --> 42:33.966
If I get scared I'm getting right into your bed.
I don't care about the rules.

42:34.133 --> 42:37.679
So if you wake up with somebody,
don't worry, it's me.

42:37.845 --> 42:41.767
OK. And if I'm not there,
I'll be in Sylvia's room.

42:41.933 --> 42:43.686
Oh, you...

42:46.438 --> 42:48.817
And if you get scared, just remember,

42:48.982 --> 42:52.654
I'm down the hall
and nothing'll happen to you while I'm here.

42:52.820 --> 42:54.386
OK.

42:54.448 --> 42:56.533
Good night, sweetie.

42:56.698 --> 42:59.495
- Good night, cookie.
- Good night, my angel cakes.

43:03.916 --> 43:05.586
Larry! Oh, honey...

43:05.751 --> 43:09.840
Well, I can't sleep. How do you like that?

43:10.006 --> 43:15.680
I have been in there tossing and turning
for hours. How about you, Sylvia?

43:15.846 --> 43:19.434
Yeah, I was thanking Larry
for a wonderful evening...

43:19.601 --> 43:24.524
and just saying how happy I am for you both.

43:24.690 --> 43:27.693
- Anyway... good night, Larry.
- Good night.

43:27.861 --> 43:30.405
- Good night, Vickie.
- Good night, Sylvia.

43:30.571 --> 43:32.824
See you in the morning for breakfast?

43:32.991 --> 43:34.869
- Yeah.
- Bye.

43:35.035 --> 43:36.600
Bye.

43:38.496 --> 43:40.333
Good night, honey.

43:40.499 --> 43:42.063
Good night, sweetheart.

44:03.108 --> 44:05.612
Beat it, while you're still healthy.

44:53.458 --> 44:55.000
- Jesus!
- Sh!

44:55.001 --> 44:58.254
Where you been? You're late.
I came looking for you.

44:58.422 --> 45:01.341
I couldn't get away. Where's the body?

45:01.508 --> 45:03.885
- I didn't know where to put her.
- Him.

45:04.052 --> 45:07.057
Him. He's in an empty bed on the second floor.

45:07.222 --> 45:11.102
Are you crazy? I can't have the police
snooping around this place.

45:11.269 --> 45:14.981
That's your problem. This is too risky.
Just pay me, I'm going.

45:15.149 --> 45:18.903
- You goofed up once today.
- Don't blame me.

45:19.069 --> 45:22.741
He was in a dress and a wig.
How could I know?

45:22.907 --> 45:27.330
- You'll get your money when the job is done.
- I'll get my money tonight.

45:27.495 --> 45:31.459
Or I'll tell your whole family
what you're up to.

45:31.625 --> 45:36.006
You wouldn't know about the change
in the will if I hadn't told you.

45:36.173 --> 45:40.970
- I want Larry Abbot dead.
- Kill him yourself.

45:41.135 --> 45:47.352
You wouldn't have to hire people like me
if you had the guts to kill...

46:06.290 --> 46:10.461
I'm all by myself and I'm very, very scared.

46:11.838 --> 46:15.091
Gee, ain't you a swell little duck?

46:15.258 --> 46:17.971
Are you afraid of werewolves?

46:18.136 --> 46:21.683
Are you kidding?
The werewolf will eat me up.

46:21.850 --> 46:24.769
Would you like to give me
a little kiss?

46:24.935 --> 46:27.355
I'm a little shy, but OK.

46:28.982 --> 46:35.656
Aren't you scared to be
in this great big house?

46:35.823 --> 46:41.621
What? Scared?
Are you kidding? I'm not afraid of anything.

46:43.165 --> 46:46.210
- Uh-oh.
- Sh. Don't be frightened, Vickie.

46:46.377 --> 46:49.004
I need your help.

47:06.024 --> 47:07.588
Yuck.

47:12.532 --> 47:18.205
It's cold in here. Oh, what a day.

47:21.208 --> 47:25.464
Why, you little devil.
You did it, didn't you?

47:26.798 --> 47:31.553
I didn't think you'd have the nerve.
Oh, darling...

47:33.096 --> 47:36.017
What a great gift you're giving to me.

47:37.560 --> 47:40.772
I'll cherish this night for the rest of my life.

47:42.482 --> 47:47.739
Say, you're very quiet, aren't you?
What's the matter, honey?

47:47.905 --> 47:53.120
Are you shy?
You want me to make the first move?

47:54.412 --> 47:56.373
Come here, cookie.

47:57.623 --> 48:00.586
Oh, honey...

48:03.923 --> 48:07.970
Want to play Donald?

48:09.137 --> 48:11.015
Oh, baby, oh...

48:12.224 --> 48:15.103
Go slow. Go slow, honey.

48:15.268 --> 48:17.314
Oh, sweetheart.

48:21.277 --> 48:25.865
Honey, your little body is frozen.

48:26.949 --> 48:28.994
Your legs are like ice.

48:30.704 --> 48:34.667
Well, maybe this'll warm you up.

48:41.716 --> 48:44.887
Pfister, thank goodness.
Something terrible has happened.

48:45.053 --> 48:48.225
- I found cousin Francis in my bed.
- Wearing a dress?

48:48.391 --> 48:49.600
Yes, he was.

48:49.601 --> 48:52.687
Ask him to leave.
Say you have a headache.

48:52.853 --> 48:56.567
No, you don't understand.
Francis Junior is dead, do you hear?

48:56.734 --> 48:59.195
- He's dead.
- You must be mistaken, sir.

48:59.362 --> 49:01.906
No, come in here, please.
I'll show you.

49:14.586 --> 49:20.135
- Do you see him?
- I think you'd better take a look, sir.

49:25.306 --> 49:29.020
- This can't be.
- I'm afraid so, sir.

49:29.187 --> 49:34.944
I'm telling you I felt a cold dead body
lying beside me in bed. Do you understand?

49:35.110 --> 49:38.948
I feel that every night. Warm brandy helps.

49:47.207 --> 49:50.670
- Are you sure you'll be all right, sir?
- Mm-hm.

49:50.836 --> 49:52.922
Good night, sir.

49:53.088 --> 49:56.384
Whoops, there goes my imagination again.

49:56.550 --> 50:00.973
- Beg pardon, sir?
- Nothing, Pfister, thanks. Good night.

50:01.139 --> 50:03.643
Good night, sir.

50:06.979 --> 50:11.067
Pleasant dreams.

50:18.867 --> 50:22.331
All right, no more nonsense.

50:22.497 --> 50:25.793
You were right, honey.
It was just my imagination.

50:34.677 --> 50:38.848
Now, you'd think this would frighten me.

50:39.975 --> 50:47.171
Well, it doesn't. Because I know that this is
just a filthy figment of my diseased imagination.

50:50.071 --> 50:56.995
And all I have to do to prove it
is simply reach out my hand...

51:04.252 --> 51:06.380
and touch it.

51:16.475 --> 51:21.231
Don't be a scaredy-cat. There's nothing there.

51:21.397 --> 51:23.734
Just touch it.

52:21.089 --> 52:22.654
Larry...

52:42.198 --> 52:44.409
Larry...

53:37.302 --> 53:39.472
Larry...

53:46.104 --> 53:48.398
Larry...

54:48.258 --> 54:50.761
What the hell's going on over there?

54:50.927 --> 54:54.598
- That's the Abbot place, isn't it?
- We better take a look.

55:21.044 --> 55:23.214
Ah! Who's that?

55:23.379 --> 55:25.758
- Pfister!
- Master Larry.

55:25.925 --> 55:29.138
Oh, thank goodness.
Look, it's cousin Francis.

55:30.972 --> 55:32.388
He's dead!

55:32.389 --> 55:36.687
- That's what I was trying to tell you.
- You killed your own cousin.

55:36.854 --> 55:40.066
What? Remember I tried to show you a body?

55:40.232 --> 55:42.652
You're the werewolf.
I've gotta tell your aunt.

55:42.818 --> 55:45.531
Wait a minute. Will you listen to me?

55:45.697 --> 55:49.952
- Somebody killed him and dragged him here.
- You did, you fiend.

55:50.118 --> 55:53.539
Are you crazy? Will you let me explain to you?

55:53.705 --> 55:57.169
There's something fishy
going on here and I don't like it.

55:57.334 --> 56:01.131
Now please stop eating
and tell me if everything's all right.

56:01.298 --> 56:04.218
- Murderer!
- Yes, everything's fine.

56:04.385 --> 56:08.724
- What was that?
- My husband in the cellar, drunk as usual.

56:08.889 --> 56:13.353
Oh, yeah? Well, I think we'd better
take a look ourselves.

56:15.563 --> 56:18.693
Thank you for the cake, ma'am.

56:18.859 --> 56:22.197
You've got the disease,
the curse of the werewolf.

56:22.363 --> 56:24.991
The beast is in your blood.

56:25.159 --> 56:26.723
Ow!

56:34.253 --> 56:36.463
- Hold it right there.
- What?

56:36.631 --> 56:40.802
- Just keep sitting right where you are.
- Sitting?

56:40.968 --> 56:43.429
Oh... All right.

56:43.597 --> 56:45.724
We heard some hollering down here.

56:45.889 --> 56:47.726
Oh, you mean...

56:50.436 --> 56:56.402
You filthy beast! I'll kill you! Murderer!

56:58.154 --> 57:04.036
- You some kind of crackpot?
- No, I was just going over my lines.

57:04.203 --> 57:07.415
- Who are you?
- Larry Abbot. My aunt lives here.

57:07.582 --> 57:12.378
Larry Abbot? Holy smokes.
You mean the radio actor?

57:12.546 --> 57:16.134
Yeah, that's me. I was just going over my lines.

57:21.139 --> 57:23.225
Murderer!

57:24.308 --> 57:28.189
You have to get it right
or the audience won't believe you.

57:28.356 --> 57:31.233
- That was you we heard?
- That was me.

57:31.401 --> 57:37.866
I didn't want to disturb the folks upstairs
so I came down here to sit and relax and...

57:40.701 --> 57:44.291
...go over my lines.
- What brings you here, Mr Abbot?

57:44.457 --> 57:45.707
Getting married.

57:45.708 --> 57:48.086
- Really?
- Yeah, finally gonna do it.

57:48.253 --> 57:52.758
- You boys must know her. Vickie Pearle.
- Hey, that's exciting.

57:52.925 --> 57:58.890
Yes, sir. It's the biggest thrill of my life,
I can tell you that. What the...?

57:59.057 --> 58:02.853
- What are you doing, Mr Abbot?
- Rats. Something terrible.

58:03.019 --> 58:06.106
It's the only drawback really
to rehearsing down here.

58:06.272 --> 58:09.861
Have you seen the butler?
He's supposed to be down here.

58:10.027 --> 58:12.990
No, no... I haven't seen him.

58:13.156 --> 58:16.827
Ho ho ho ho ho
Forget your troubles, come on, get happy

58:17.034 --> 58:20.415
We're gonna chase all your blues away
Boo, boo, shout hallelujah

58:20.581 --> 58:23.167
Come on, get happy
Get...

58:24.210 --> 58:26.171
ready for the judgement day

58:28.841 --> 58:32.220
Oh. I have to sing in next week's programme.

58:32.386 --> 58:37.059
If you don't mind, I'll take a look around
before we go, for safety's sake.

58:37.225 --> 58:39.769
- Sure.
- Well, good night for now.

58:39.936 --> 58:41.185
Good night.

58:41.186 --> 58:45.193
- Night, Mr Abbot.
- Good night, nice of you boys to drop by.

58:45.358 --> 58:46.923
Murderer!

58:48.195 --> 58:51.450
That was phoney.
Murderer...

58:51.615 --> 58:53.326
Mmm... better.

58:53.493 --> 58:55.870
Why, you filthy beast.

58:56.039 --> 58:58.792
- Come on, Bill.
- I'll kill you. Murd...

59:06.091 --> 59:11.138
That was a close call. Poor old Pfister.

59:11.305 --> 59:15.936
Sorry I had to hit you, old fella.
How you doing?

59:16.101 --> 59:20.941
Pfister, do you know where Vickie is?
Pfister, can you hear me?

59:21.108 --> 59:24.905
- Pardon.
- Oh, dear.

01:00:11.457 --> 01:00:15.003
Who is it? Who's there?
Is someone there?

01:00:15.211 --> 01:00:17.380
Pfister, is that you?

01:00:28.852 --> 01:00:33.941
Madam Kate was right. I saw it.

01:00:34.108 --> 01:00:37.403
- You saw what, you drunken sot?
- The werewolf.

01:00:37.570 --> 01:00:39.656
- What?
- It wasn't Master Larry.

01:00:39.823 --> 01:00:43.952
What are you babbling about?
The police were here. Did you know that?

01:00:44.117 --> 01:00:46.330
- I've got to hide Master Francis.
- What?

01:00:46.496 --> 01:00:49.041
Master Larry's innocent. I must hide that body.

01:00:49.209 --> 01:00:51.211
- Give me that.
- It's mine.

01:00:51.376 --> 01:00:54.297
- Give it to me.
- It's my last one.

01:00:54.463 --> 01:00:56.258
Pull free.

01:00:57.885 --> 01:01:01.723
"When the wine runneth red,
it biteth like a serpent".

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:16.031
Vickie!

01:01:29.587 --> 01:01:32.425
Vickie!

01:01:32.590 --> 01:01:34.259
Larry...

01:01:34.426 --> 01:01:36.553
Ow, this thing's pinching my butt.

01:01:36.719 --> 01:01:40.475
Just hang on for a minute, Vickie.
Hang on. God!

01:01:40.641 --> 01:01:44.771
I should never have let your father
talk me into this.

01:01:44.938 --> 01:01:50.695
Vickie, would you hold still, please?
I can't control this if you move around.

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:55.367
If you want my opinion, I think
this Strickland thing is a lot of baloney.

01:01:55.533 --> 01:01:57.244
Ow!

01:01:57.410 --> 01:02:00.539
- Could you let me down for a minute?
- Why?

01:02:00.705 --> 01:02:03.668
- I gotta go to the powder room.
- Vickie!

01:02:03.834 --> 01:02:07.297
I gotta go to the can. What should I do?

01:02:07.463 --> 01:02:10.091
Hold still. Just hold still.

01:02:10.257 --> 01:02:12.761
All right. This is gonna be some wedding.

01:02:12.928 --> 01:02:16.807
A loony for a husband
and Peter Pan for his wife.

01:03:08.157 --> 01:03:14.164
- Isn't it nice Mr Abbot's getting married?
- Shut up and keep your eyes open.

01:03:14.329 --> 01:03:17.126
What are they looking for?
They could ruin things.

01:03:17.293 --> 01:03:21.048
- Dr Strickland didn't have the police, did he?
- I could kill them!

01:03:21.213 --> 01:03:25.595
- Don't worry, Dad. There's plenty of time.
- There is not.

01:04:02.094 --> 01:04:05.848
- That's my lightning machine.
- Where's Vickie?

01:04:06.013 --> 01:04:10.145
- She's in the powder room.
- What is that supposed to mean?

01:04:10.312 --> 01:04:12.355
I assume she's powdering her nose.

01:04:16.652 --> 01:04:19.698
- There's something fishy here.
- That came from the garden.

01:04:19.864 --> 01:04:21.824
Come on.

01:04:44.934 --> 01:04:48.187
- Pfister!
- Master Larry, you did frighten me.

01:04:48.354 --> 01:04:50.731
- What have you got there?
- The other body.

01:04:50.899 --> 01:04:53.444
- What other body?
- He was under your cousin.

01:04:53.611 --> 01:04:55.529
I was about to bury them.

01:04:55.697 --> 01:05:01.535
- Hey, what's going on over there?
- Get rid of the bodies! They'll think I did it.

01:05:02.495 --> 01:05:05.999
- They must be around here somewhere.
- There!

01:05:06.167 --> 01:05:09.545
Hey, who are you people?
What are you doing?

01:05:09.712 --> 01:05:13.716
- Stay right where you are.
- We got you covered, so no fast moves.

01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:17.388
What the...?

01:05:18.013 --> 01:05:22.059
- Mr Abbot.
- Hello there. What a beautiful night, isn't it?

01:05:22.227 --> 01:05:24.520
Isn't it romantic?

01:05:24.687 --> 01:05:29.317
Drifting shadows write the oldest magic word

01:05:29.483 --> 01:05:33.781
Oh, to be dancing with the woman you love,
just before the wedding.

01:05:34.866 --> 01:05:37.076
Darling...

01:05:42.249 --> 01:05:45.878
The woman you love? You mean, this is...

01:05:46.044 --> 01:05:48.965
Boys, meet Vickie Pearle.

01:05:49.131 --> 01:05:54.013
How do you do, Miss Pearle?
Holy mackerel, wait till I tell the kids.

01:05:54.179 --> 01:05:56.640
Gosh, could I trouble you for an autograph?

01:05:56.807 --> 01:05:59.184
Well...

01:05:59.351 --> 01:06:03.857
- Am I imposing too much, Mr Abbot?
- No, that's all right.

01:06:04.023 --> 01:06:06.526
- Do you have pencil and paper?
- Sure.

01:06:06.694 --> 01:06:09.739
- What's your name?
- Bill.

01:06:09.905 --> 01:06:12.116
All right.

01:06:12.283 --> 01:06:17.371
Could you hold the pad steady,
please? There you go, Bill.

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:21.294
Thanks, Mr Abbot. That's awfully nice of you.

01:06:21.459 --> 01:06:27.132
- Quite all right, Bill.
- We'll leave you two lovebirds alone now.

01:06:27.299 --> 01:06:34.392
Come on, Mickey. Weren't they nice?
I love show folks. They're so full of life.

01:06:37.395 --> 01:06:40.231
I'm ready, Charles.

01:06:45.027 --> 01:06:47.322
Charles?

01:06:48.448 --> 01:06:51.118
Charlie? Hey, where'd everybody go?

01:06:51.285 --> 01:06:55.332
I woke up in the woodbin
and saw you go to the kitchen.

01:06:55.498 --> 01:06:58.418
Then this fiend crossed straight in front of me.

01:06:58.584 --> 01:07:00.421
He couldn't have been more than...

01:07:01.506 --> 01:07:03.069
Oh my! Pfister!

01:07:05.384 --> 01:07:06.885
Help! Someone help!

01:07:06.886 --> 01:07:09.723
He couldn't have been more than what?

01:07:32.749 --> 01:07:35.669
Paul! Francis!

01:07:38.339 --> 01:07:40.842
Charles!

01:08:18.134 --> 01:08:21.054
Whoever your werewolf is, he's gone now.

01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:25.935
I saw him just a few moments ago.
He was standing right here.

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:29.898
Aunt Kate, don't start again
about one of us being a werewolf.

01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:33.276
This is the 20th century.
People don't become werewolves.

01:08:33.442 --> 01:08:36.113
Are you so sure?

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:40.242
- Excuse me. I want to see who they are.
- Don't!

01:08:40.408 --> 01:08:44.456
I'm sorry, Francis. Your son is dead.

01:08:44.622 --> 01:08:48.669
- He's been murdered.
- Oh, my God.

01:08:50.252 --> 01:08:54.466
- Oh, dear God in heaven!
- I'm so sorry, Francis.

01:08:54.634 --> 01:08:57.553
- Who was the other man?
- We don't know, Francis.

01:08:58.679 --> 01:09:01.684
Dr Abbot. Where's Larry?

01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:06.354
- Aunt Kate saw him here with a werewolf.
- Cut the bullshit.

01:09:06.523 --> 01:09:10.484
I just want to know where Larry is.

01:09:10.652 --> 01:09:16.325
I don't know where Larry is.
If I did I'd tell you, I swear to God.

01:09:26.210 --> 01:09:29.131
- There's a homicidal maniac loose.
- Where are the police?

01:09:29.296 --> 01:09:32.551
- They're gone. I saw them leave.
- Should I call them?

01:09:32.719 --> 01:09:35.345
Yes, you'd better. All right, let's spread out.

01:09:35.513 --> 01:09:40.852
- Men check the grounds, the women inside.
- Come with me while I call the police.

01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:43.272
- Kate.
- Go on, find Larry.

01:09:43.439 --> 01:09:45.984
I'll stay here with Pfister. Go on.

01:09:46.151 --> 01:09:48.694
- Are you sure?
- Go on, go on.

01:10:19.606 --> 01:10:23.735
Larry, stop whimpering.
Stand up straight like a big boy.

01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:27.447
You've got to help Mummy.
This is a very special day.

01:10:27.613 --> 01:10:30.285
Look at your tie.
It's all twisted again.

01:10:30.451 --> 01:10:33.745
Try to keep it straight, honey.
Just a little while longer.

01:10:33.913 --> 01:10:38.001
I don't want anything to go wrong today.

01:10:40.628 --> 01:10:44.633
What are you afraid of?
That old lightning?

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:49.598
Lightning can't hurt you, honey.
Everyone knows that.

01:11:38.236 --> 01:11:42.866
I know it's late, Officer,
but this is an emergency.

01:11:44.368 --> 01:11:47.955
No. No, I'm not imagining things.

01:11:49.708 --> 01:11:53.712
I don't care how many times
you've been out here already!

01:11:53.879 --> 01:11:55.839
Two people have been murdered.

01:11:56.006 --> 01:12:00.678
Is that important enough for a phone call
in the middle of the night?

01:12:00.845 --> 01:12:06.393
Get out here or I'm calling the mayor.
You'll be looking for a job by the morning.

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:10.439
OK. We'll see you in a few minutes, then.

01:12:13.777 --> 01:12:18.448
That guy got me angry.
Still, they'll be here in a couple of minutes.

01:12:18.616 --> 01:12:21.077
So why don't you just relax, huh?

01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:26.499
What's the matter? What are you staring at?

01:12:26.665 --> 01:12:32.881
- Nothing. You were so angry. Good for you.
- Oh, yeah. Here.

01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:51.820
Larry isn't the only actor in the family.

01:13:01.372 --> 01:13:06.544
- You filthy, murdering skunk.
- I was just trying to earn a buck.

01:14:30.348 --> 01:14:33.977
I'm the good boy, not cousin Larry.

01:14:35.728 --> 01:14:38.190
I'm smarter than cousin Larry.

01:14:39.734 --> 01:14:43.530
I'm better-looking than cousin Larry.

01:14:44.656 --> 01:14:48.243
And I'm gonna be a hell of a lot richer.

01:15:02.427 --> 01:15:08.475
That vase cost me 5,000 dollars.
There are only three like it in the world.

01:15:08.641 --> 01:15:12.479
- Two.
- You... Two.

01:15:12.645 --> 01:15:14.982
Hold this. Oh, well.

01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:18.673
Oh.

01:15:20.363 --> 01:15:24.451
- Darling...
- Let's get on with this wedding, my dears.

01:15:25.702 --> 01:15:29.916
And do you, Vickie Pearle,
take this man to love, honour and cherish...

01:15:30.082 --> 01:15:33.211
- until death do you part?
- I do.

01:15:33.376 --> 01:15:39.718
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

01:15:45.766 --> 01:15:48.145
Wait! Oh, wait.

01:15:48.311 --> 01:15:52.399
Before this moment is over
I want to say that this house...

01:15:52.566 --> 01:15:58.615
has been under a cloud of darkness
for so many years...

01:15:58.782 --> 01:16:03.621
and now, at last, the cloud has pissed...

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:07.666
passed.

01:16:08.708 --> 01:16:11.629
Passed.

01:16:11.795 --> 01:16:16.468
Yes, oh... I mean...
Ah, I mean...

01:16:16.635 --> 01:16:20.473
the cloud has passed away.

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:26.647
Oh, it's gone, it's finished.
The cloud has just really passed.

01:16:26.813 --> 01:16:29.358
- Run along, you two.
- Goodbye, Aunt Kate.

01:16:29.524 --> 01:16:34.196
- We love you.
- And have a happy, happy honeymoon.

01:16:34.364 --> 01:16:39.410
Tune in next week when Manhattan Mystery
Theatre presents Your Mummy's Calling,

01:16:39.578 --> 01:16:43.916
brought to you by Ralston Purina,
makers of Purina Dog Chow.

01:16:44.082 --> 01:16:46.502
We're a little late, so good night, folks.

01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:50.048
OK, you two lovebirds,
let's get this show on the road.

01:16:51.174 --> 01:16:55.721
I said "pissed". Did you hear?
I said "pissed" on the radio.

01:16:56.763 --> 01:17:01.520
- Here you are.
- Thank you. Bye.

01:17:01.686 --> 01:17:07.109
Oh, you... Goodbye, goodbye.
Oh, goodbye.

01:17:07.274 --> 01:17:13.575
I don't believe it. They got married on the radio
and now they're getting married in real life.

01:17:13.742 --> 01:17:17.371
- Call me tomorrow, honey!
- Get the hell outta here!

01:17:22.293 --> 01:17:24.213
Sometimes in small ways

01:17:24.379 --> 01:17:26.214
We may not agree

01:17:26.381 --> 01:17:29.510
But we will weather
Our chips together

01:17:29.676 --> 01:17:31.888
Wait and see

01:17:32.053 --> 01:17:37.685
Before you all settle back into
the cosy comfort of a happy ending,

01:17:37.853 --> 01:17:40.563
let me ask you one question.

01:17:40.729 --> 01:17:44.401
Are you so sure
that our story has ended?

01:17:44.567 --> 01:17:46.654
Mmm?

01:17:46.819 --> 01:17:50.033
Until next time, this is your host

01:17:50.199 --> 01:17:55.498
wishing you pleasant dreams.

01:20:36.595 --> 01:20:40.560
And then you twist around
And twist around with all of your might

01:20:40.725 --> 01:20:44.522
Spread your lovin' arms
Clear out a space

01:20:44.689 --> 01:20:48.068
You do the eagle rock.
With style and grace

01:20:48.234 --> 01:20:50.279
You put your left foot out

01:20:50.445 --> 01:20:52.009
And bring it back.

01:20:52.031 --> 01:20:55.826
And that's what we call
"Ballin' the Jack".

01:21:43.214 --> 01:21:47.302
Spread...

01:21:47.467 --> 01:21:50.723
Your lovin' arms way out in space

01:21:50.888 --> 01:21:53.893
Do the eagle rock. With style and grace

01:21:54.058 --> 01:21:57.814
You put your left foot out
And bring it back.

01:21:57.979 --> 01:22:01.318
And that's what we call
"Ballin' the Jack".

01:22:01.483 --> 01:22:05.823
And that's what we call

01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:08.576
Ball...

01:22:08.742 --> 01:22:11.162
"Ballin' the Jack".

01:22:12.455 --> 01:22:14.541
"Ballin' the Jack".

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.296
"Ballin' the Jack".
