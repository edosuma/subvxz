WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:04.259
La La La La La La La-- Ahh!

00:04.463 --> 00:05.589
( Screams )

00:05.797 --> 00:07.970
Braces, braces
caught in the screen door!

00:08.175 --> 00:09.472
Someone dictate my will!

00:09.676 --> 00:11.178
I'm giving it all to Waddles!

00:11.386 --> 00:12.387
Say "ah," girl-dude.

00:12.596 --> 00:14.143
Ahh-uh!

00:15.349 --> 00:17.192
Soos!
You saved me!

00:17.392 --> 00:19.486
Just doing my job,
hambone!

00:19.645 --> 00:21.192
I'll see you dudes
tomorrow!

00:21.396 --> 00:22.318
Bye, Soos!

00:22.481 --> 00:24.575
Night, Soos!

00:24.775 --> 00:26.027
Doo doo doo...

00:26.235 --> 00:28.203
Walking to my car...

00:28.362 --> 00:29.830
You ever wonder
what Soos does

00:30.030 --> 00:31.407
when he's not here
at the Mystery Shack?

00:31.615 --> 00:32.582
No.
Not really.

00:32.783 --> 00:33.830
Not once ever.

00:36.745 --> 00:38.042
Punch!

00:38.205 --> 00:39.001
Punch those leopards.

00:39.206 --> 00:40.048
( Bell chiming )

00:40.249 --> 00:41.466
Ooh, highlights are done!

00:41.667 --> 00:43.010
You are gonna make
the other grandmas

00:43.210 --> 00:45.713
at the bingo hall
so jealous.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.005
Just a minute, <i>mijo.</i>

00:47.214 --> 00:48.591
Look at this.

00:48.799 --> 00:50.472
Your cousin Reggie
is having an engagement party

00:50.676 --> 00:51.677
next month.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.808
Wait, wait.
Reggie is engaged?

00:54.012 --> 00:56.014
But he's like
the poor man's Soos!

00:56.223 --> 00:58.817
I do not want to pressure you,
but you are a man now.

00:59.017 --> 01:01.486
In a way, it's time for you
to start meeting girls.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.109
I would like to see you settled

01:03.313 --> 01:05.736
before I ascend to heaven
and live with the angels.

01:05.941 --> 01:07.113
And with grandpa!

01:07.317 --> 01:09.740
No, he is not there.

01:09.945 --> 01:12.243
Please find a girl to bring
to Reggie's engagement.

01:12.447 --> 01:14.199
For Abuelita.

01:16.326 --> 01:17.669
No problem!

01:17.869 --> 01:20.497
I'm great at fixing stuff,
playing video games,

01:20.706 --> 01:21.923
having a sort-of moustache.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.925
I could totally
get a date in a week.

01:24.126 --> 01:25.093
Totally.

01:25.294 --> 01:27.046
Piece of cake.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.801
<i>You're dead.</i>

01:28.964 --> 01:30.637
I'm dead.

02:14.926 --> 02:16.599
Hello!

02:16.762 --> 02:20.016
Please don't let my horrible,
elderly face frighten you!

02:20.223 --> 02:21.475
Don't you want
to use that nickel

02:21.642 --> 02:23.690
to get a nugget
from Old Goldie?

02:25.562 --> 02:26.688
Watch this!

02:32.694 --> 02:35.664
( Shrieking )

02:43.538 --> 02:45.256
Okay, seriously, Mr. Pines,

02:45.457 --> 02:47.425
it's time to throw
that thing out.

02:47.626 --> 02:50.129
Its face reminds everyone
of the inevitability of death.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.429
What?

02:51.630 --> 02:53.382
Sure, he's a little rusty
around the edges,

02:53.590 --> 02:57.265
but Old Goldie's
a classic show-stopper like me!

02:57.469 --> 02:58.641
Oh, kill it!

02:58.845 --> 03:01.189
Kill it!

03:05.644 --> 03:07.521
Huh, a woman!

03:10.691 --> 03:12.409
All right, Soos,
you could do this.

03:12.609 --> 03:14.452
Just use your mouth
to say words

03:14.653 --> 03:16.326
that makes romance happen.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.203
Your face is good.

03:19.408 --> 03:20.500
I'm a Soos!

03:20.701 --> 03:22.749
( Screams )

03:26.581 --> 03:27.833
Soos?

03:27.999 --> 03:28.921
What was that all about?

03:29.126 --> 03:30.878
I-- I think I was flirting!

03:31.086 --> 03:32.633
But I'm not sure.

03:32.838 --> 03:34.431
Did someone say flirting?

03:34.631 --> 03:36.099
Well, I sort of
promised my grandma

03:36.299 --> 03:37.676
I'd get a date
by the end of the week.

03:37.843 --> 03:40.517
But I've never actually
been on a date before.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.602
You belong on me,
Out of Order sign.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.646
Finally, my prayers
for a chance

03:45.851 --> 03:48.650
to match-make this summer
have been answered!

03:48.854 --> 03:51.448
Soos, a little advice
you need to get rich.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.525
Or lie about being rich.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.281
Outside of that,
I don't like your chances.

03:55.444 --> 03:57.538
Don't listen to Stan, dude.

03:57.738 --> 03:58.864
You're a sweet guy
with a steady job

03:59.072 --> 03:59.868
and a pickup truck.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.199
Would you date him?

04:01.408 --> 04:03.581
Oh...
would you look at that...

04:03.785 --> 04:06.629
Soos, you help us so much,
it's time we help you, dude.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.082
We're gonna
get you that date.

04:08.290 --> 04:10.167
We're taking you
where romance lives

04:10.375 --> 04:12.173
and fashion styles die.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.549
To the mall!

04:15.672 --> 04:17.800
I'm gonna go find a replacement
for Old Goldie.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.680
Babysit Soos
while I'm gone.

04:21.052 --> 04:22.429
All right, Soos,

04:22.637 --> 04:24.310
are you ready to explode
a charm bomb

04:24.514 --> 04:26.357
on these poor,
unsuspecting ladies?

04:26.558 --> 04:29.152
Ah, but what if
I embarrass myself again?

04:29.352 --> 04:31.446
Ah, you can't be any worse
at this than Dipper.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.401
Yeah!

04:32.606 --> 04:33.528
Wait...what?

04:34.566 --> 04:36.034
And flirt!

04:38.904 --> 04:39.826
Eye contact!

04:40.030 --> 04:41.202
Hey there!

04:41.406 --> 04:42.828
I'm not scared of your eyes
at all!

04:43.033 --> 04:44.376
I'm gonna look at them!

04:44.576 --> 04:45.418
( Screams )

04:45.619 --> 04:46.836
Eye contact.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.539
Conversation!

04:48.747 --> 04:51.500
You know I've actually
been in a pig's body.

04:51.708 --> 04:52.925
Did you know pigs
have a hard time

04:53.126 --> 04:53.922
walking backwards?

04:54.127 --> 04:55.174
Not you though!

04:55.378 --> 04:56.220
Not that
I'm calling you a pig.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.217
Where are you going?

04:57.422 --> 04:59.015
Confidence!

05:00.509 --> 05:03.479
So you're probably a girl,
right?

05:03.678 --> 05:04.645
Wrong?

05:04.846 --> 05:06.564
No, I was right
the first time.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.184
Wrong?

05:10.936 --> 05:11.983
Tossing away garbage

05:12.187 --> 05:14.986
in the garbage can,
whew!

05:16.399 --> 05:18.276
Ah, don't look at me
like that!

05:18.443 --> 05:19.615
This is how
it's got to be!

05:24.199 --> 05:25.200
What in the--

05:32.207 --> 05:33.800
What is this
living nightmare?

05:33.959 --> 05:36.212
Why do kids
love it so much?

05:37.921 --> 05:39.889
Who wants
to get badgered?

05:41.383 --> 05:42.509
Oh, yeah,
that's Will E. Badger.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.719
He opens for Hoo-Ha
and the Jamboree.

05:46.972 --> 05:47.973
It's Will E. Badger.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.103
I love you, Will E.

05:49.307 --> 05:52.277
Now, give me your money!

05:52.477 --> 05:53.820
Take my money!
Take it all!

05:54.020 --> 05:55.613
Oh!

05:55.814 --> 05:58.613
Sir, I would like
to buy that badger.

05:58.817 --> 06:00.239
You're in over your head,
Gramps!

06:00.402 --> 06:02.370
Animatronics is
a young man's game!

06:03.655 --> 06:05.123
You couldn't handle
the hardcore life

06:05.282 --> 06:06.499
of the pizza robot manager.

06:06.700 --> 06:07.872
Huh.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.043
Ff inched!

06:10.328 --> 06:12.001
Hey, you, barfing
in the ball pit,

06:12.163 --> 06:14.291
Gary's on the case!

06:14.499 --> 06:16.672
I'm gonna
get that badger!

06:18.461 --> 06:19.337
Don't worry, Soos.

06:19.546 --> 06:20.718
You will find the right girl,

06:20.881 --> 06:22.849
you just need
to stick with it.

06:24.759 --> 06:27.387
Ah, could this day
get any worse?

06:27.596 --> 06:29.598
Oh, no, cousin Reggie!

06:29.764 --> 06:32.358
Feel it, it's muscle.

06:32.559 --> 06:33.481
He can't see me
like this!

06:33.643 --> 06:34.690
I got to hide!

06:40.609 --> 06:41.451
This is it, Soos.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.528
A lifetime of loneliness.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.239
You're the only ones
who could love me...

06:45.447 --> 06:47.870
Fighty Hogg,
Dr. Punch Head MD.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.536
Huh.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.246
Never seen that one before.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.877
"Virtually improve
your dating skills,

06:55.040 --> 06:56.667
9 out of 10 basement dwellers
recommend!"

06:56.875 --> 06:58.502
This is perfect!

06:58.710 --> 07:00.929
Well, I guess you are better
at games than at flirting.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.972
Anything to get you
out there, Soos!

07:03.173 --> 07:05.551
I'm not sure you want
to buy that game, sir.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.557
This is the third time
someone's brought that back.

07:07.719 --> 07:10.723
And there's a note on it
that says destroy at all costs.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.150
So, hey, there.
What's your deal?

07:13.350 --> 07:14.602
Like the--
Oh, she's dead.

07:14.809 --> 07:16.482
We'll take our chances.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.362
Man, I can't wait
for the year 2000.

07:27.364 --> 07:28.206
Uh-.

07:28.406 --> 07:29.373
<i>Sta rt!</i>

07:31.201 --> 07:33.545
When the cherry petals
of magic romance academy

07:33.745 --> 07:34.621
are in bloom...

07:34.829 --> 07:36.547
anthyding can hadplen.

07:36.748 --> 07:37.965
That is so true.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.047
<i>Oh, hi there.</i>

07:40.251 --> 07:41.673
<i>My name is Giffany,</i>

07:41.878 --> 07:44.256
<i>I'm a school girl
at school university,</i>

07:44.464 --> 07:46.466
<i>will you help me
carry my books?</i>

07:46.675 --> 07:48.643
I'm really feeling
number two here.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.019
Click!

07:50.220 --> 07:51.437
Ah.
I messed up.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.560
<i>That's okay.</i>

07:52.722 --> 07:54.190
<i>Try again.</i>

07:56.559 --> 07:57.606
Wow!
I'm learning.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.984
And games
are making it fun.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.361
<i>What would you like
to talk about?</i>

08:02.524 --> 08:04.401
I'd rather just
click your face.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.242
<i>You are so funny!</i>

08:08.405 --> 08:09.657
Man, this game
is amazing.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.411
I don't know
why anyone abandoned it.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.914
<i>And I'm sure,
you'll never abandon me,</i>

08:14.119 --> 08:15.291
<i>new boy friend.</i>

08:15.495 --> 08:16.291
Boy friend?

08:16.496 --> 08:17.713
Oh, my Giffany,

08:17.914 --> 08:19.757
it's almost like
you're actually alive!

08:19.958 --> 08:21.551
<i>Yes, almost.</i>

08:24.796 --> 08:28.426
Oh, man, you have
such a nice laugh.

08:31.428 --> 08:32.554
You don't understand,
Wendy.

08:32.721 --> 08:35.315
This animatronic badger sings,
it dances.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.357
It's the perfect
money taking attraction

08:37.558 --> 08:38.731
but he won't sell it to me.

08:38.934 --> 08:41.438
This is literally too dumb
for me to care about.

08:41.645 --> 08:43.239
Hey, have you guys
seen Soos?

08:43.440 --> 08:44.657
We're supposed to help him
with matchmaking today.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.235
Yeah!

08:46.401 --> 08:49.075
I wore my motivational
sweater and everything.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.155
I messed up that part.

08:50.321 --> 08:51.743
He didn't come in today.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.871
It's the first time
he's missed work ever.

08:59.372 --> 09:02.216
So that's basically
my entire life story.

09:02.417 --> 09:04.010
Now you tell me
a thing about you.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.382
<i>Every time
you compliment me,</i>

09:05.587 --> 09:07.430
<i>I get another highlight
in my eyes.</i>

09:07.630 --> 09:08.973
Ah, you're pretty.

09:09.174 --> 09:10.721
And pixelly.

09:10.884 --> 09:11.931
And so agreeable.

09:14.679 --> 09:15.555
Yes.

09:15.722 --> 09:16.814
Uh, Soos.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.392
Oh, hi, dudes, come in.

09:18.600 --> 09:19.817
This game is amazing.

09:20.018 --> 09:22.487
I'm making eye contact,
going on dates

09:22.687 --> 09:23.984
and I haven't seen
any natural sunlight

09:24.189 --> 09:26.157
for 13 hours.

09:26.357 --> 09:30.362
Soos, maybe it's time to apply
these skills with real girls.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.163
But, I'm about to meet her
parents!

09:32.322 --> 09:35.496
Her dad is an
octopus man.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.202
( Screams )

09:37.410 --> 09:39.037
We're going back
to the mall, man.

09:39.204 --> 09:40.581
You need to unplug!

09:40.789 --> 09:42.791
I'll see you later, Giffany.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.922
I'll be back, I swear.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.003
Soos, you don't have
to wish her goodbye.

09:47.212 --> 09:48.509
It's just a game!

09:48.713 --> 09:50.590
It's not like
it's going anywhere.

09:50.799 --> 09:54.724
<i>Yes, it's not like
I'm going anywhere.</i>

09:59.891 --> 10:01.518
Hello,

10:01.684 --> 10:03.607
time to read
Soos's diary.

10:05.855 --> 10:06.947
Dang!

10:07.148 --> 10:08.491
Where all of them
sweet honeys at?

10:08.691 --> 10:10.739
I'll check
the ladies bathroom!

10:10.944 --> 10:12.241
It's love time, girls!

10:12.403 --> 10:13.325
Get out there!

10:13.530 --> 10:14.702
No time
to wash your hands!

10:14.906 --> 10:16.123
Get out of here.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.330
It's time to date,
date, date.

10:18.535 --> 10:19.957
And here comes security.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.497
I'll deal with this.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.627
Stay here and practice
on some real girls.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.802
These girls have
so many dimensions

10:30.964 --> 10:33.387
and no explanationy menus.

10:33.591 --> 10:35.093
Ah, my purse.

10:35.301 --> 10:36.097
Oh, no!

10:36.302 --> 10:37.519
Undo!Undo!

10:37.679 --> 10:40.603
You can't undo
who you are.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.734
Oh, man, this is the worst.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.360
I wish I was
back home with...

10:48.523 --> 10:49.775
<i>Hi, Soos.</i>

10:49.983 --> 10:51.360
Giffany!

10:51.568 --> 10:53.491
Oh, man, I am so relieved
to see you!

10:53.695 --> 10:55.368
Although, sort of confused.

10:55.572 --> 10:56.915
<i>Oh, Soos,</i>

10:57.115 --> 10:58.913
<i>I am not an ordinary game!</i>

10:59.117 --> 11:01.666
<i>I am special.</i>

11:01.870 --> 11:05.295
<i>The programmers
tried to delete me.</i>

11:05.498 --> 11:07.717
<i>So I had to delete them.</i>

11:10.670 --> 11:12.092
What did you do to them?

11:12.297 --> 11:13.594
<i>That's not important.</i>

11:13.798 --> 11:15.471
<i>What's important is</i>

11:15.675 --> 11:18.019
<i>you don't have to talk
to real girls ever again.</i>

11:18.219 --> 11:19.516
<i>You and me can
be together...</i>

11:19.679 --> 11:23.183
<i>forever!</i>

11:23.391 --> 11:24.483
Wow, that's awesome!

11:24.642 --> 11:25.564
Sort of a red flag.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.020
But mostly awesome!

11:27.228 --> 11:28.571
So what do you want
to do now?

11:28.771 --> 11:30.819
<i>Anything you want, Soos.</i>

11:33.193 --> 11:34.365
<i>Choc-choc.</i>

11:37.447 --> 11:39.916
<i>COMPUTER: Please insert
50 cents to continue.</i>

11:40.116 --> 11:42.369
Aw, man!

11:42.577 --> 11:45.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.165
Dude, that's awesome
that you're a grown man

11:47.373 --> 11:48.716
riding a little train
like that.

11:48.917 --> 11:49.793
You're totally
like owning it.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.256
Huh?

11:51.461 --> 11:54.431
Oh, yeah, I'm like,
if it's fun, do it.

11:54.631 --> 11:55.427
You know?

11:55.632 --> 11:56.633
Exactly!

11:56.799 --> 11:58.472
Being an adult
is the worst!

11:58.676 --> 12:01.099
Skewering meat,
remembering to pay bills.

12:01.304 --> 12:03.102
I just want to ride
tiny trains all day.

12:03.306 --> 12:05.183
At least you get to work
at Meat Cute,

12:05.391 --> 12:07.485
extreme lunch meats
are the food of the future.

12:07.685 --> 12:08.937
I feel the same way.

12:09.145 --> 12:09.941
I'm Melody by the way.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.489
I'm Soos!

12:11.689 --> 12:13.532
I tell you,
if you like robots for kids,

12:13.733 --> 12:14.529
you should check out
the best restaurant

12:14.734 --> 12:15.360
of all time.

12:15.568 --> 12:16.990
You mean...

12:17.195 --> 12:19.163
BOTH: Hoo-Ha Owl's
Pizzamatronic Jamboree.

12:19.322 --> 12:20.369
What?

12:20.573 --> 12:21.574
You've heard of Hoo-Ha Owl's?

12:21.783 --> 12:23.376
I loved that place
when I was a kid!

12:23.576 --> 12:25.249
Oh, yeah, dude,
there's one right in this mall!

12:25.453 --> 12:26.796
I should show you sometime.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.498
I'm free around eight?

12:28.706 --> 12:29.673
Boom.
Done.

12:29.874 --> 12:30.921
Perfect.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.677
I'll see you then.

12:39.509 --> 12:40.761
What a nice lady.

12:40.969 --> 12:43.518
Well, back to riding this
tiny train for children.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.224
Soos!

12:47.350 --> 12:48.192
We saw the whole thing, Soos.

12:48.393 --> 12:49.485
That was amazing!

12:49.686 --> 12:51.063
You talked to a real girl.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.648
And you got a date!
I did?

12:52.855 --> 12:53.947
Ah!
Ah!

12:54.148 --> 12:56.276
This is the best day
of my life!

12:56.442 --> 12:58.319
You were in the zone,
you made eye contact.

12:58.528 --> 13:00.951
It was like you'd done this
a million times before!

13:01.155 --> 13:02.031
Don't you see?

13:02.240 --> 13:03.332
That game really worked!

13:03.533 --> 13:04.409
You don't need it anymore!

13:04.617 --> 13:05.960
You can toss it out!

13:06.119 --> 13:06.961
Toss it?

13:07.120 --> 13:08.337
But I like Giffany!

13:08.538 --> 13:09.414
She's good to me!

13:09.622 --> 13:10.839
She's predictable!

13:10.999 --> 13:12.876
Soos,
can a computer game

13:13.042 --> 13:15.340
go to Reggie's enSlaSlement Part
with you? y

13:15.545 --> 13:16.842
Uh...

13:17.005 --> 13:19.679
Hey, Giffany,
we got to talk.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.434
<i>Of course,
I'm programmed to find</i>

13:21.634 --> 13:23.386
<i>everything you say interesting.</i>

13:23.594 --> 13:24.766
Well, have you ever had
to choose between

13:24.971 --> 13:26.564
two things you like,

13:26.723 --> 13:27.975
but you don't know
which one is right for you?

13:28.182 --> 13:30.651
I mean,
I'm just thinking long term.

13:30.852 --> 13:32.854
Maybe I should be
with someone a little less

13:33.062 --> 13:35.235
beep-boop, you know.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.441
<i>I don't think you know
what you are saying, Soos.</i>

13:36.649 --> 13:38.322
<i>No one loves you
more than me.</i>

13:38.526 --> 13:40.449
<i>The girls out there
will just make fun of you.</i>

13:40.653 --> 13:42.030
You really think so?

13:42.238 --> 13:43.239
<i>I know so.</i>

13:43.448 --> 13:44.995
<i>Besides, we had a deal.</i>

13:45.199 --> 13:47.247
<i>You bought my game,
you held my books,</i>

13:47.452 --> 13:48.578
<i>you are my boyfriend.</i>

13:48.786 --> 13:50.459
<i>Now sit down in that chair.</i>

13:50.663 --> 13:52.381
I don't think I like the way
you are acting.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.755
<i>I won't let another girl
take you away from me, Soos!</i>

13:54.959 --> 13:56.256
Giffany, calm down.

13:56.461 --> 13:57.838
<i>You are mine, Soos!</i>

13:58.004 --> 13:58.971
Pause.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.643
Oh, that got intense.

14:04.802 --> 14:05.894
I'm sorry, Giffany.

14:06.095 --> 14:08.063
Maybe having
a cursed robo girlfriend

14:08.264 --> 14:09.481
wasn't a good idea.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.438
I'm taking you back
to the video game store

14:11.601 --> 14:12.602
after my date
with Melody.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.247
Hello, old friends.

14:25.448 --> 14:27.416
I've got to be careful
this time.

14:27.617 --> 14:29.540
No more Colombian nights.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.712
All right, Stan,
this is weird even for you,

14:31.913 --> 14:33.335
you need to talk?

14:33.539 --> 14:35.541
Nothing you could say
will change my mind, Wendy.

14:35.750 --> 14:38.674
Sometimes, a man has to steal
an animatronic badger

14:38.878 --> 14:41.301
to stay in this crazy game
called life.

14:41.506 --> 14:43.099
Or you could just not care.

14:43.299 --> 14:44.471
It's about the principle.

14:44.675 --> 14:46.928
No one tells Stan Pines
he is out of the game.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.262
No one tells--

14:48.471 --> 14:50.098
( screams )

14:50.306 --> 14:51.933
I'll get your
orthopedic back pillow.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.188
Thank you!

14:54.227 --> 14:55.479
You can do this, Soos.

14:55.686 --> 14:57.905
Just remember
what your love crew taught you!

14:58.106 --> 14:59.153
How does she look?

14:59.357 --> 15:00.153
Nice!

15:00.358 --> 15:01.234
What are her stories?

15:01.401 --> 15:02.402
Interesting!

15:02.610 --> 15:04.112
And who's gonna
pay for dinner?

15:04.278 --> 15:05.700
Soos is!

15:05.905 --> 15:07.157
Now date!

15:07.323 --> 15:08.495
( Blows horn )

15:08.699 --> 15:10.167
( Soos screaming )

15:10.368 --> 15:12.291
They grow up so fast.

15:12.495 --> 15:14.042
Itchy legs, itchy N395-

15:14.205 --> 15:15.206
Oh, hi, Soos.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.507
Melody!

15:16.707 --> 15:21.133
Are you ready
for a date with me?

15:21.337 --> 15:22.805
( Iaughil19 )

15:23.005 --> 15:24.302
I totally am.

15:26.884 --> 15:27.885
Good show, man.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.516
Way to warm them up!

15:29.679 --> 15:31.022
I wish I was more like you.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.020
Man, I could go for some

15:37.228 --> 15:40.107
complimentary bread sticks
right now.

15:40.314 --> 15:41.736
One time
I was so hungry

15:41.941 --> 15:45.195
I ate the decorational bamboo
in a Chinese restaurant.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.534
Like a big old panda.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.541
You're hilarious.

15:50.741 --> 15:53.039
Well, you know,
I just sort of say

15:53.202 --> 15:55.296
whatever
pops into my--

16:02.670 --> 16:03.887
Soos, are you okay?

16:04.088 --> 16:04.884
No, I'm fine.

16:05.089 --> 16:05.885
Everything's fine.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.057
Are you sure?

16:07.258 --> 16:08.726
You are spitting
an awful lot.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.804
Uh, could you sit tight?

16:12.013 --> 16:14.061
I have go to the bathroom
for a long time.

16:14.265 --> 16:16.017
Not in a weird way.

16:17.602 --> 16:19.479
Soos!
What are you doing out there?

16:19.687 --> 16:21.610
I got a big problem, guys,
I am being stalked by Giffany.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.066
Giffany?

16:23.274 --> 16:24.651
Or maybe
it's pronounced Giffany.

16:24.859 --> 16:25.906
I was never really sure.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.487
Soos, get a grip on yourself.

16:27.695 --> 16:30.198
Giffany can't stalk you
because she is not real.

16:35.578 --> 16:36.500
Uh-oh.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.001
Take it from someone
who brought

16:38.206 --> 16:40.504
an arcade game to life.
This will not end well.

16:40.708 --> 16:43.382
Don't worry, I'm pretty sure
she is stuck on TV screens.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.216
<i>Ah, a new challenger
approaches,</i>

16:48.424 --> 16:49.391
<i>prepare to be--</i>

16:53.054 --> 16:54.601
Oh, boy-

16:54.764 --> 16:56.858
So hey! Anyway, you want to move
this date into the forest

16:57.058 --> 16:58.810
far away from all electronics
and people?

16:59.018 --> 17:01.396
What? But the floor show's
about to start!

17:01.562 --> 17:04.441
( Music plays )

17:10.613 --> 17:13.457
Who wants to hear
Hoo-Ha the owl!

17:17.662 --> 17:21.165
Hello, friends,
Hoo-Ha the owl is dead.

17:23.542 --> 17:26.968
This next song goes out to my
forever boyfriend, Soos.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.718
Soos, what's going on?

17:28.881 --> 17:29.757
No time to explain!

17:29.924 --> 17:31.016
We got to get out of here!

17:34.011 --> 17:37.515
The only way out, Soos,
is in my arms.

17:37.682 --> 17:38.683
Capture them!

17:40.726 --> 17:42.399
( Growling )

17:42.562 --> 17:44.109
( people screaming )

17:45.439 --> 17:46.486
Done!

17:46.691 --> 17:48.068
Out with the old,
in with the new!

17:48.276 --> 17:49.653
I feel invincible.

17:50.903 --> 17:51.745
Ah!

17:51.946 --> 17:53.368
What--
what the--

17:53.573 --> 17:57.578
Who wants to get badgered?

18:00.204 --> 18:01.831
Sorry, Soos.

18:02.039 --> 18:05.339
But you can't run away
from our relationship.

18:11.716 --> 18:12.968
So about all this,

18:13.175 --> 18:14.552
I may have purchased
a dating simulator

18:14.719 --> 18:16.596
that attained sentience
and went crazy.

18:16.762 --> 18:17.934
Oh, I am crazy.

18:18.139 --> 18:20.767
Crazy for you, Soos.

18:22.143 --> 18:22.985
Ah!

18:23.185 --> 18:24.528
Oh, no.

18:24.729 --> 18:26.402
Oh, I'm so sorry, Melody!
I'll fix this!

18:26.564 --> 18:27.986
It's me that she wants.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.363
I'll distract her while
Dipper and Mabel keep you safe.

18:30.568 --> 18:32.036
It's the only way.

18:32.236 --> 18:33.613
Soos, these are children.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.994
The only WHY!

18:36.198 --> 18:37.666
( Groaning )

18:37.867 --> 18:38.663
Over here, Giffany!

18:38.868 --> 18:39.790
Stop!

18:45.625 --> 18:46.376
On three, we split.

18:46.584 --> 18:48.586
One, two-

18:48.794 --> 18:50.262
( screaming )

18:51.631 --> 18:53.178
Stay back, you monster!

18:53.382 --> 18:54.725
Ah!

19:04.018 --> 19:06.646
Yes, yes, get him, Goldie,
get him.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.659
I'm gonna eat your face
like pizza.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.710
I have got you surrounded,
Soos.

19:28.918 --> 19:30.920
There is no way out.

19:31.128 --> 19:32.550
Please, let my friends go.

19:32.755 --> 19:34.678
I'll do anything you want.
I promise.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.719
I seem to remember
someone promising

19:37.927 --> 19:40.521
he will be my boyfriend.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.479
<i>Think about it,
real girls are unpredictable,</i>

19:43.641 --> 19:46.235
<i>they judge you.</i>

19:46.435 --> 19:49.234
<i>You really think Melody
is going to take you back</i>

19:49.438 --> 19:51.566
<i>after this awful date?</i>

19:53.776 --> 19:56.495
I can download your brain
into the game with me

19:56.696 --> 19:58.915
and we will be together
forever.

19:59.115 --> 20:00.037
Ah!

20:01.617 --> 20:02.459
Stay back.

20:02.660 --> 20:03.877
Come on, Soos.

20:04.078 --> 20:07.423
Don't make me
to leave you, too.

20:07.623 --> 20:08.749
What do you say?

20:09.875 --> 20:12.344
I saVr Qame over,
Giffany!

20:13.963 --> 20:14.930
No!
Wait!

20:35.651 --> 20:36.402
You did it!

20:36.610 --> 20:37.827
You old, beautiful monster!

20:38.028 --> 20:39.280
You did it!

20:39.488 --> 20:41.206
How's about you and me
hit the town?

20:41.407 --> 20:43.876
These old has-beens
are going to Vegas!

20:49.039 --> 20:50.461
I'm sorry for all this.

20:50.666 --> 20:51.918
I honestly remember
this place being a lot more fun

20:52.126 --> 20:53.469
when I was a kid.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.888
Believe it or not,
I've been on worse dates.

20:56.088 --> 20:56.884
Really?

20:57.089 --> 20:58.215
Never date a magician.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.597
Ew!
Why would I?

21:00.760 --> 21:02.603
Oh, hey, you wouldn't maybe
be interested

21:02.762 --> 21:03.638
in coming to my cousin's

21:03.804 --> 21:05.147
engagement party
in a week?

21:05.347 --> 21:07.896
I promise there is like
zero robot badgers.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.228
Yeah, I'll still be
in town then.

21:10.436 --> 21:11.779
Still be in town?

21:11.979 --> 21:13.947
I'm going back home to Portland
in a few weeks

21:14.148 --> 21:16.367
but we can video chat,
if that's okay with you?

21:16.567 --> 21:17.693
A relationship with a girl

21:17.902 --> 21:19.825
that I can only see
through my computer,

21:20.029 --> 21:22.373
sounds perfect.

21:22.573 --> 21:25.702
Spirit of love,
we did it.

21:25.910 --> 21:28.379
Yes, yes,
I'm so haPPY-

21:28.579 --> 21:30.547
Have you been
following us all day?

21:30.748 --> 21:32.921
Soos's life
is my soap opera.
