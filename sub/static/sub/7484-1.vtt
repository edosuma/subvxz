(CAR ENGINE RUNNING)

01:26.671 --> 01:30.550
ABE: <i>Kant said human reason is troubled by
questions that it cannot dismiss,</i>

01:30.675 --> 01:32.761
<i>but also cannot answer.</i>

01:33.011 --> 01:35.096
<i>Okay, so, what are we talking about here?</i>

01:35.221 --> 01:37.348
<i>Morality? Choice?</i>

01:37.807 --> 01:41.227
<i>The randomness of life?
Aesthetics? Murder?</i>

01:46.524 --> 01:49.194
JILL: <i>I think Abe was crazy
from the beginning.</i>

01:49.444 --> 01:52.322
<i>Was it from stress? Was it anger?</i>

01:52.489 --> 01:56.868
<i>Was he disgusted by what he saw
as life's never-ending suffering?</i>

01:57.327 --> 01:58.703
<i>Or was he simply bored</i>

01:58.870 --> 02:01.956
<i>by the meaninglessness
of day-to-day existence?</i>

02:02.207 --> 02:05.335
<i>He was so damn interesting.
And different.</i>

02:05.627 --> 02:06.878
<i>And a good talker.</i>

02:07.045 --> 02:09.881
<i>And he could always
cloud the issue with words.</i>

02:10.840 --> 02:12.634
ABE: <i>Where to begin?</i>

02:12.801 --> 02:14.886
<i>You know, the existentialists
feel nothing happens</i>

02:15.053 --> 02:17.555
<i>until you hit absolute rock bottom.</i>

02:17.722 --> 02:20.225
<i>Well, let's say that when I went
to teach at Braylin College,</i>

02:20.391 --> 02:22.894
<i>emotionally, I was at Zabriskie Point.</i>

02:23.061 --> 02:27.524
<i>Of course, my reputation,
or should I say a reputation, preceded me.</i>

02:28.399 --> 02:31.069
JOE: I hear Abe Lucas is gonna be
joinin' the faculty this summer.

02:31.236 --> 02:32.362
JUDY: Really?

02:32.529 --> 02:35.240
That should put some Viagra
into the philosophy department.

02:35.532 --> 02:37.742
He's this really interesting guy,
but he looks totally wasted.

02:37.909 --> 02:39.160
I kind of like the burned-out look, though.

02:39.285 --> 02:40.328
Oh, my God, me too.

02:40.453 --> 02:42.664
Well, yeah, and he has affairs
with some of his students, I heard.

02:42.914 --> 02:45.208
- Really?
- Yeah, like full... Yeah.

02:45.708 --> 02:47.669
Abe Lucas is teaching
my Ethical Strategies class

02:47.836 --> 02:48.878
for summer session.

02:49.045 --> 02:50.588
- Have you read any of his papers?
- Mmm-hmm.

02:50.755 --> 02:52.882
He's very radical.
Very original.

02:53.049 --> 02:54.425
You either love him or hate him, really.

02:54.592 --> 02:56.386
Faye Cohen knows someone who knows him,

02:56.553 --> 03:01.432
but she says, he had a serious depression
when his wife left him.

03:01.599 --> 03:03.726
The story is,
she ran off with his best friend.

03:03.893 --> 03:05.103
Really?

03:05.270 --> 03:06.729
'Cause, actually,
what I heard through the rumor mill

03:06.896 --> 03:08.439
was he had a breakdown
when his best friend was killed.

03:08.606 --> 03:11.067
He was a TV crew guy in Iraq
and he got beheaded.

03:11.234 --> 03:12.944
Isn't that gruesome if it's true?

03:13.111 --> 03:16.030
Jesus, I haven't even met the guy yet,
and I'm already jealous.

03:16.197 --> 03:19.033
(CHUCKLING) Jealous?
I love that you're jealous.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.618
That makes me feel desired.

03:20.785 --> 03:23.121
Oh, God, you don't have to worry.
Everybody on campus desires you.

03:23.288 --> 03:25.582
- Oh, come on.
- But I have you.

03:26.207 --> 03:27.847
I don't know, suddenly the thought of you

03:27.959 --> 03:30.712
coming under the spell
of some charismatic professor...

03:30.879 --> 03:34.549
Oh, God, you don't have to worry.
I'm under your spell.

03:35.550 --> 03:37.927
Good. Let's keep it that way.

03:38.094 --> 03:39.137
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

03:55.653 --> 03:57.071
Excuse me.

03:57.238 --> 03:59.908
Uh, do you know where Jessup Hall is?

04:00.074 --> 04:02.827
Yes, Jessup Hall is that building
over there, the red one.

04:02.994 --> 04:05.288
Uh-huh, all right.
Thank you.

04:07.624 --> 04:08.791
ASSISTANT: Doctor Reed?

04:08.958 --> 04:10.835
- Oh.
- ASSISTANT: Professor Lucas.

04:11.252 --> 04:14.505
- Professor Lucas, welcome to Braylin.
- Thank you.

04:15.673 --> 04:17.507
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

04:18.801 --> 04:22.597
- I'm sure you've had a long trip.
- Mmm-hmm. It was, yeah.

04:23.181 --> 04:25.183
- Well, um...
- Thank you.

04:25.767 --> 04:27.518
We've just concluded our spring semester,

04:27.685 --> 04:30.688
and summer's always very active at Braylin.

04:31.147 --> 04:32.815
(SIGHING) Uh-huh.

04:33.107 --> 04:36.945
We're all very happy to have you here
in the philosophy department.

04:37.195 --> 04:38.821
Mmm, thank you.

04:41.032 --> 04:42.367
This is it.

04:42.533 --> 04:44.953
Now, the faculty housing
is pretty much spread out,

04:45.119 --> 04:46.759
but, you know, everything you can get to.

04:46.829 --> 04:49.040
It's within walking distance of the campus.

04:49.207 --> 04:50.875
And you're really gonna like Newport.

04:51.042 --> 04:53.962
It's beautiful here, but it gets
a little crowded in the summer.

04:54.128 --> 04:55.380
That can be a drag.

04:56.047 --> 04:59.050
It's a small house,
but it's really comfortable.

04:59.217 --> 05:03.554
Um, right over here is the living room,
and there's a little kitchen that way.

05:03.888 --> 05:05.928
And there's a little dining room
right next to that.

05:06.057 --> 05:07.183
Upstairs...

05:08.017 --> 05:09.060
This way.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.479
Bathroom to the right.

05:12.397 --> 05:16.067
And this is the bedroom.
It's small, but really comfortable.

05:16.234 --> 05:18.403
And there's an office over there.

05:18.569 --> 05:21.364
I think you'll really love
the philosophy department, you know?

05:21.531 --> 05:24.242
It's in this old,
beautiful part of the campus.

05:24.409 --> 05:25.994
And there's a more modern wing,

05:26.160 --> 05:29.038
that's got state-of-the-art
stuff for science,

05:29.205 --> 05:31.040
and computer technology,
if you're into that.

05:31.207 --> 05:34.919
Oh, and if you want to go away,
we're just 45 minutes from Providence.

05:35.086 --> 05:36.286
Thank you.
Do you want a drink?

05:36.421 --> 05:38.589
(CHUCKLING) Oh, no! God, no.

05:39.173 --> 05:43.011
There's a little cocktail reception
to welcome you at 6:00.

05:43.344 --> 05:45.430
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

05:45.596 --> 05:49.851
You know, I have to tell you,
I loved your essay on situational ethics.

05:50.018 --> 05:52.437
Oh, I'm glad you liked it.

05:52.603 --> 05:56.941
It caused a little, uh, static
with the philosophy department at Adair.

05:58.026 --> 05:59.444
- This is my husband, Paul.
- Hey, how you doin'?

05:59.610 --> 06:02.330
- This is Abe Lucas, philosophy department.
- BOTH: Good to meet you.

06:02.405 --> 06:03.906
- Yeah.
- How you doin' on that?

06:04.073 --> 06:05.233
I'd like another one, please.

06:05.366 --> 06:07.452
- What is it?
- Vodka martini, extra olives.

06:07.618 --> 06:10.121
- Anything for you?
- Sure, I'll have another.

06:10.288 --> 06:11.748
- Uh, scotch?
- Mmm-hmm.

06:11.914 --> 06:13.082
- Okay.
- Thank you.

06:13.249 --> 06:16.794
I'm Rita Richards.
It's so good to have you here.

06:17.879 --> 06:19.922
Hey, if you're ever bored
and you want someone to give you

06:20.089 --> 06:23.092
the real lowdown of
who's fucking who at this college,

06:23.259 --> 06:24.969
just let me know.

06:26.262 --> 06:31.434
So, Kant would argue
that in a truly moral world,

06:31.976 --> 06:34.645
there is absolutely no room for lying.

06:35.980 --> 06:38.107
And even the smallest lie

06:38.483 --> 06:41.611
destroys his precious
categorical imperative.

06:42.737 --> 06:46.074
So, Kant would say,
if a killer came to your house,

06:46.407 --> 06:50.244
looking to kill the man hiding upstairs
and asked where he was,

06:50.411 --> 06:52.663
you'd be obliged to tell him.

06:53.956 --> 06:57.251
In his perfect world,
you know, you couldn't lie.

06:58.086 --> 06:59.837
Yeah, I can see the logic

07:00.004 --> 07:03.174
that if you open the door,
even just a crack,

07:03.341 --> 07:05.968
you accept a world where
lying is permitted.

07:06.177 --> 07:07.470
Uh-huh.

07:07.845 --> 07:11.182
Okay, then, then you'd say
if the Nazis came to your house,

07:11.349 --> 07:13.351
hiding Anne Frank and her family,

07:13.518 --> 07:15.686
and asked if anyone
was in the attic, you'd say,

07:15.853 --> 07:18.189
(IMITATING GERMAN ACCENT)
<i>"Ja,</i> the Franks are upstairs."

07:18.356 --> 07:19.816
I doubt it.

07:20.775 --> 07:23.277
Because there's a difference between

07:23.444 --> 07:26.531
a theoretical world of philosophy bullshit,

07:28.199 --> 07:30.535
and real life, you know?

07:31.035 --> 07:33.663
Real, nasty, ugly life

07:34.205 --> 07:37.792
that includes greed,
and hate, and genocide.

07:40.044 --> 07:42.547
Remember,
if you learn nothing else from me,

07:42.713 --> 07:46.884
you should learn that much of philosophy
is verbal masturbation.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.388
EDGAR: Have you talked to him at all?
MS. LEONARD: Mmm.

07:50.555 --> 07:53.641
You know, I asked him
if he wanted to eat with us.

07:53.808 --> 07:56.144
- I like the guy, but he's in a world...
- He likes to eat alone.

07:56.269 --> 07:57.687
Yeah, he's in a world all his own.

07:57.812 --> 07:59.063
I think he likes to keep to himself a bit.

07:59.230 --> 08:00.356
Uh, yeah, I guess so.

08:00.523 --> 08:02.066
Yeah, so, let him be. Right?

08:02.233 --> 08:04.360
- Could take some time.
- Right.

08:04.861 --> 08:06.863
ABE: Okay, Kierkegaard.

08:07.196 --> 08:08.239
Um...

08:08.406 --> 08:11.242
You know, when making everyday decisions,

08:11.742 --> 08:14.078
we have absolute freedom of choice.

08:14.245 --> 08:17.874
All right?
You can do nothing, or anything.

08:18.708 --> 08:23.087
And this feeling of freedom
creates a sense of dread.

08:23.838 --> 08:25.506
A dizzy feeling.

08:26.424 --> 08:29.093
Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.095
RITA: The students love you,

08:31.262 --> 08:35.265
but, of course, you've raised
some eyebrows with the faculty.

08:36.267 --> 08:39.187
- Do you ever get discouraged teaching?
- No.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.272
You don't ever ask yourself
what the hell is it all about?

08:41.438 --> 08:42.440
Mmm-mmm.

08:42.607 --> 08:46.027
Another school, another batch of kids.

08:46.777 --> 08:48.196
Sweet kids.

08:48.571 --> 08:50.448
Mmm. Average kids.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.034
Nice, but mostly mediocre.

08:53.159 --> 08:56.454
They'll grow up to be those people
who shape the world with their ignorance

08:56.621 --> 08:59.040
or misinformation, or passivity.

09:01.626 --> 09:03.794
- Are you okay?
- Hmm?

09:03.961 --> 09:05.755
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

09:05.922 --> 09:08.549
You want to come in?
This is where I live.

09:08.716 --> 09:12.220
Paul's in Aspen at a symposium.
I've got great grass.

09:13.262 --> 09:15.890
- (CLICKS TONGUE) Some other time.
- Are you sure?

09:17.141 --> 09:18.309
Yeah.

09:18.893 --> 09:21.062
Thanks. Thanks anyway.
I'll see you.

09:24.732 --> 09:28.152
Tomorrow we're gonna discuss
phenomenology and Husserl.

09:28.319 --> 09:30.279
So, be sure you do the reading, you know?

09:30.446 --> 09:32.281
It can get a little complicated.

09:32.490 --> 09:33.491
All right?

09:46.337 --> 09:48.422
Hi, you wanted to see me?

09:48.631 --> 09:51.008
Yes, your paper was quite good.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.178
- Really?
- Yes.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.514
I read so many papers and,

09:56.931 --> 09:59.016
usually the students are merely
paraphrasing what they've read,

09:59.183 --> 10:02.520
but I found your thinking
fresh and well-presented.

10:04.188 --> 10:06.440
Oh, thank you.
I'm flattered.

10:07.149 --> 10:12.530
I have to say, I was very influenced by
your ideas on randomness and chance.

10:13.197 --> 10:16.325
Well, the truth is,
what I found most exciting

10:16.492 --> 10:18.661
was when you took issue with my ideas.

10:18.869 --> 10:20.705
When you disagreed with me,

10:20.871 --> 10:24.542
your arguments were
well-reasoned and original.

10:25.876 --> 10:28.713
(LAUGHING) Am I blushing right now?

10:29.338 --> 10:32.216
That's a really big compliment.
Thank you.

10:33.843 --> 10:37.513
Um, I did actually find
some parts of your book

10:37.680 --> 10:39.724
a little hard to follow though,

10:39.890 --> 10:44.061
and I would love if you
could explain some things to me.

10:44.228 --> 10:48.524
Sure, can we get out of here,
though, before I die of suffocation?

10:49.692 --> 10:52.987
I found your view of existence
too bleak for me.

10:53.154 --> 10:57.199
It was like there were
no redeeming joys or pleasures.

10:57.366 --> 10:58.409
Okay.

10:58.576 --> 11:02.371
Why are you taking philosophy?
What do you want out of it?

11:02.580 --> 11:04.040
Because if your goal is
to try and figure out

11:04.206 --> 11:07.168
what all this bullshit's about, forget it.

11:07.335 --> 11:10.838
You write books, you write papers.
You've done so much.

11:11.005 --> 11:14.884
Well, let me tell you, when I look back
at all that verbal posturing,

11:15.051 --> 11:17.470
my group thought we were
going to be so special.

11:17.636 --> 11:20.931
I marched in every bullshit
political demonstration.

11:21.098 --> 11:23.601
I spent six months in Darfur
getting food to starving families,

11:23.768 --> 11:25.311
I wind up with meningitis.

11:25.478 --> 11:27.563
- Mmm.
- I was in Bangladesh.

11:27.730 --> 11:30.250
Yeah, you know, you want to see
a difference, to save the world.

11:30.316 --> 11:33.861
(SIGHING) But when you see
what you're up against...

11:34.362 --> 11:37.323
Do you like vintage single malt?
You drink?

11:38.532 --> 11:40.076
You mean here?

11:40.993 --> 11:43.287
- Yeah.
- (CHUCKLING) Right now?

11:43.454 --> 11:45.915
(CHUCKLING) No, no, I couldn't.

11:47.792 --> 11:50.753
JILL: <i>There was no way I could have
realized from that first conversation</i>

11:50.920 --> 11:53.506
<i>that a lot was very wrong with Abe.</i>

11:53.798 --> 11:58.094
<i>He was so damn fascinating and vulnerable,
and I must say, I found him attractive.</i>

11:58.260 --> 12:00.429
<i>I guess it helped that
he felt comfortable with me.</i>

12:00.596 --> 12:02.139
I drove a cab.

12:02.348 --> 12:05.101
- I was a handyman in a building.
- (CHUCKLES)

12:05.267 --> 12:07.895
I ran an elevator.
But I always read.

12:08.687 --> 12:11.357
Always, always loved the Russian writers.

12:11.524 --> 12:13.776
Especially Dostoyevsky.
Dostoyevsky got it.

12:15.111 --> 12:16.946
I've read all of it.

12:17.238 --> 12:18.948
- Really?
- Mmm.

12:20.032 --> 12:22.243
JILL: Oh, I had a great conversation
with Abe Lucas the other day.

12:22.410 --> 12:23.452
Uh-huh.

12:23.619 --> 12:25.746
He said my paper was
well-organized and original.

12:25.913 --> 12:26.956
- All right.
- Right?

12:27.123 --> 12:28.416
Yeah, I can see where this is goin'.

Oh, stop it, please.

He's just fascinating because he's brilliant,
but he's a sufferer.

12:33.879 --> 12:36.006
Perfect. Great, you always
became attracted to the sufferers.

12:36.173 --> 12:37.675
Right? That's how we first met.

12:37.842 --> 12:39.718
He's a real sufferer, Roy.
You had shingles.

12:41.137 --> 12:44.306
He was traumatized
when his best friend was killed in Iraq.

12:44.473 --> 12:48.102
- He was a journalist, just horrifying.
- Didn't he get his head cut off?

12:48.269 --> 12:50.729
His head cut off?
No, no, it was an explosion.

12:50.896 --> 12:51.939
ROY: Oh.

12:52.106 --> 12:55.693
God, it's amazing how people
embellish these stories.

12:55.860 --> 12:58.571
You know, Abe actually says
that people just manufacture drama

12:58.737 --> 13:01.449
so they can get through their lives
because they're so empty.

13:01.615 --> 13:04.410
Can we just change the subject
of Abe Lucas, please?

his praises for half an hour.

how about I sing yours?

I love you in that sweater.

13:13.419 --> 13:15.588
Of course, you love me in this sweater.
You bought it for me.

Well, you look great in that shade of blue.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.509
You really do.

He was 12.

13:27.349 --> 13:30.019
She drank bleach!
It's so sad.

13:30.769 --> 13:34.356
You know, Simone de Beauvoir pointed out,
and quite correctly,

13:34.523 --> 13:36.775
that in a society shaped by men,

13:36.942 --> 13:40.112
women are seen as relative beings
existing only in relationship to men.

13:40.279 --> 13:42.406
- Hmm.
- You agree with that?

13:43.032 --> 13:45.701
- I agree with that completely.
- Mmm-hmm.

13:45.868 --> 13:48.787
I'm sure you've heard the rumors about you.

13:48.954 --> 13:52.124
That you've had a lot of
experience with women.

13:52.291 --> 13:54.210
You mean slept with.

14:02.593 --> 14:05.095
It had a certain frantic quality.

14:06.305 --> 14:08.140
One day, it stopped being exciting.

14:09.099 --> 14:10.518
I couldn't find distraction anymore

the orgasm.

14:14.605 --> 14:16.023

14:16.690 --> 14:19.610
I couldn't remember the reason for living.

14:19.985 --> 14:23.155

it wasn't convincing.

14:23.531 --> 14:25.366
That sounds scary.

14:26.867 --> 14:29.662
It's very scary when
you run out of distractions.

14:30.996 --> 14:32.248
Well, what if it wasn't a distraction?

14:32.414 --> 14:36.252
What if you just decided
to commit yourself to one person?

14:36.752 --> 14:40.714

I'm too far gone to appreciate her.

just wallowing in your room.

15:41.692 --> 15:45.321
I'm sorry for dropping in so suddenly but,

15:46.322 --> 15:49.450
I was shopping today at
the liquor store, and,

15:49.867 --> 15:53.621
I came across these two very fine bottles
of single malt scotch,

15:53.787 --> 15:55.247
and I got one for Paul and myself.

15:55.414 --> 15:58.125
And I know how much
you love single malt scotch.

15:58.292 --> 16:02.212
Oh, that was very thoughtful of you.
How much do I owe you?

You could have waited to give it to me.
You didn't have to come in the rain.

16:12.473 --> 16:15.225
I couldn't wait.
I was excited over it.

16:16.935 --> 16:18.854
Will you have one with me?

16:19.021 --> 16:21.148
I thought you'd never ask.

Um... Hmm.

of stupidity and greed.

23:13.935 --> 23:16.605
Romantics think suicide is romantic.

23:21.693 --> 23:23.413
JILL: <i>The truth was I was attracted to Abe.</i>

23:23.570 --> 23:26.740
<i>Despite, or was it because,
he was a lost soul.</i>

23:27.866 --> 23:30.577
<i>There was something
about his pain and sensitivity</i>

23:30.744 --> 23:33.246
<i>that tapped into my romantic fantasies.</i>

23:33.413 --> 23:37.334
<i>It was exciting going to museums
and seeing movies with him.</i>

23:37.501 --> 23:39.753
<i>He was truly an original thinker.</i>

23:39.920 --> 23:43.090
<i>The problem was he had no zest for life,</i>

23:43.256 --> 23:47.552
<i>no joy, no clear reason for living,
he said, which alarmed me.</i>

23:48.845 --> 23:51.139
<i>I wanted so much to help him.</i>

23:51.306 --> 23:52.599
I've given up.

23:52.766 --> 23:53.809
It's all bullshit.

23:53.975 --> 23:56.603
You know, my bullshit book
on Martin Heidegger

23:56.770 --> 23:59.314
is not gonna make
a scintilla of difference to the world.

23:59.481 --> 24:01.608
Why do you say things like that?
How do you know that?

24:01.775 --> 24:03.527
I set out to be an active world changer

24:03.693 --> 24:07.114
and wound up a passive intellectual
who can't fuck.

24:09.032 --> 24:13.537
Well, Abe, maybe Rita Richards
couldn't get your creative juices flowing,

24:13.703 --> 24:16.289
but did you think that maybe I could?

24:16.456 --> 24:17.916
Uh-uh, Jill.

24:18.875 --> 24:20.085
Don't.

24:21.211 --> 24:22.629
Don't what?

24:23.088 --> 24:24.631
Don't do this.

24:26.633 --> 24:27.926
(SCOFFING)

24:29.010 --> 24:31.680
Well, we spend a lot of time together, Abe.

24:31.847 --> 24:33.348
- You know, and I...
- We're friends.

24:33.515 --> 24:35.058
I know it's...

24:35.475 --> 24:39.813
All right, well, I thought you could tell
that I cared about you.

24:39.980 --> 24:42.858
I mean, it's pretty obvious to everyone.

24:43.900 --> 24:45.986
Including your boyfriend?

24:46.736 --> 24:49.948
I don't... I'm not ready to make
an exclusive commitment to him.

24:50.115 --> 24:51.366
He's...

24:52.784 --> 24:55.162
- I just have a lot of questions and...
- All right, Jill.

24:55.328 --> 24:57.914
Maybe we're spending
too much time together.

24:58.081 --> 25:00.876
Maybe I shouldn't monopolize your time.

25:06.298 --> 25:07.924
- Okay.
- (SIGHING)

25:10.510 --> 25:12.053
ROY: Why are you in such a bad mood?

25:12.220 --> 25:14.264
Roy, I'm fine.
All right?

25:14.431 --> 25:16.631
Can't I just be a little bit edgy
every once in a while?

25:16.766 --> 25:19.519
Well, have you thought
any more about what I said?

25:19.686 --> 25:20.854
What?

25:21.479 --> 25:23.815
That after graduation, we go to London,
we move in together

25:23.982 --> 25:25.817
and we do our postgrad work at Oxford, no?

25:25.984 --> 25:28.945
(STUTTERING) It's a very
big idea and I don't know.

25:29.112 --> 25:30.947
I think it would be a great experience.

25:31.114 --> 25:32.657
Jill, stop, stop.

25:32.824 --> 25:35.827
Come on, you know I love you.
What's wrong?

25:36.578 --> 25:38.914
I just can't talk about
this right now, Roy.

25:39.080 --> 25:40.790
I feel very achy.

25:41.208 --> 25:43.376
Like maybe I'm coming down
with something, or...

25:43.543 --> 25:45.921
- Okay...
- I don't know, like a flu or...

25:46.087 --> 25:47.923
(SIGHING) All right.

25:50.508 --> 25:52.510
Isn't it a lovely spot?

25:53.261 --> 25:54.638
I love it.

25:55.805 --> 25:58.391
I come here when I want to be alone.

26:01.353 --> 26:03.313
You're looking a little glum.

26:04.397 --> 26:06.733
I'm sorry about this afternoon.

26:08.151 --> 26:11.321
I thought maybe some time had passed,
you know?

26:11.488 --> 26:13.698
And you took the Cialis?

26:13.907 --> 26:15.450
Against my better judgment.

26:16.326 --> 26:18.370
Can I confess something?

26:19.496 --> 26:24.000
When I heard you were coming here,
I'd walk along these rocks,

26:24.960 --> 26:29.297
and had fantasies that we'd meet
and something special would happen.

26:29.839 --> 26:32.717
If you're unhappy,
why can't you just up and leave?

26:33.260 --> 26:34.803
(SIGHING) I...

26:36.179 --> 26:38.014
I can't do it alone.

26:39.057 --> 26:40.850
You know, I just can't.

26:41.017 --> 26:43.353
I need somebody to leave with.

26:45.355 --> 26:47.440
ABE: <i>Jill had been right
in her appraisal of me.</i>

26:47.607 --> 26:49.818
<i>I was teetering on the brink
of some kind of breakdown,</i>

26:49.985 --> 26:54.114
<i>unable to deal with my feelings
of anger, frustration, futility.</i>

26:56.032 --> 26:59.202
<i>They say that drowning
is a painless way to go.</i>

27:00.662 --> 27:04.791
Despair is what Kierkegaard called
the sickness unto death, Abe.

27:05.959 --> 27:08.253
And you suffer from despair.

27:09.045 --> 27:12.007
I'm well aware of what Kierkegaard thought.

27:12.340 --> 27:16.594
But he was, in the end, a Christian.
How comforting that would be.

27:18.013 --> 27:21.016
So, are you looking forward
to your piano recital tonight?

27:21.182 --> 27:22.267
Did you settle on the Bach?

27:22.434 --> 27:23.727
- We'll figure this out.
- CAROL: I don't know.

27:23.893 --> 27:24.936
This is wrong.

27:25.103 --> 27:27.689
Are you aware of
what's going on at this table?

27:27.856 --> 27:28.898
ABE: What?

27:29.065 --> 27:32.610
- It is a messed-up situation.
- (MOUTHING)

27:32.777 --> 27:34.697
CAROL: And my kids
feel like I'm not comin' back.

27:34.821 --> 27:35.864
EVE: Aw, that's not true.

27:36.031 --> 27:38.908
CAROL: I know.
I don't know what to do.

27:39.075 --> 27:40.410
I'm at my wit's end.

27:40.577 --> 27:42.245
Who's the judge?

27:42.537 --> 27:44.247
CAROL: Uh, Spangler. Thomas Spangler.

27:44.414 --> 27:46.875
How'd this guy ever wind up
in family court? It's just...

27:47.042 --> 27:48.251
They're political appointees.

27:48.418 --> 27:51.218
Some are okay, but a lot of 'em are
just bums who are getting paid off.

27:51.296 --> 27:52.630
It's not right.

27:52.797 --> 27:55.925
He awards the kids to Frank.
Frank doesn't even look after them.

27:56.092 --> 27:57.719
- BIFF: It's true...
- Frank doesn't even want them.

27:57.886 --> 28:00.347
BIFF: He doesn't care about his own kids.

28:00.847 --> 28:02.682
CAROL: I deliver them to him,
they don't want to go.

28:02.849 --> 28:04.893
They're crying.
They're crying.

28:05.935 --> 28:07.354
What does Frank do?

28:07.520 --> 28:10.357
He sticks 'em in a corner
of the garage he works at.

28:10.523 --> 28:12.817
And they sit underground all day.

28:12.984 --> 28:15.528
I mean, they should be outside,
in the fresh air.

28:17.781 --> 28:19.991
(SOBBING) And now he's gonna
switch custody to Frank?

28:20.158 --> 28:22.577
- On what grounds?
- On no grounds.

28:23.203 --> 28:26.498
Because he's friendly in some way
with Frank's lawyer.

28:26.664 --> 28:28.625
(SIGHING) Switching custody
would be a disaster.

28:28.792 --> 28:30.126
HAL: It doesn't make sense.

28:30.293 --> 28:33.046
I brought in the kids' teachers,
I brought in the kids' doctors.

28:33.213 --> 28:34.464
It doesn't matter.

28:34.756 --> 28:37.217
And you're sure he can't be recused?

28:37.384 --> 28:40.387
CAROL: We tried.
My lawyer tried and failed.

28:42.263 --> 28:45.725
I can't keep payin' all these legal bills
and the judge knows it.

28:45.892 --> 28:48.173
So, every time I want something,
he says, "Make a motion."

28:48.228 --> 28:50.605
And we do, but he turns me down.

28:51.106 --> 28:53.566
And it's costin' me everything I got.

28:53.733 --> 28:55.860
- (SOBBING) And I'm gonna lose my kids.
- Aw.

28:56.027 --> 28:58.071
HAL: And you're sure he's cozy
with Frank's lawyer?

28:58.238 --> 29:01.699
CAROL: Oh, God,
they look at each other, they smile.

29:02.033 --> 29:05.161
(SCOFFING) I got a bad break,
drawin' this judge.

29:05.620 --> 29:07.455
It's just so unfair.

29:07.664 --> 29:10.125
(SNIFFING) I'm due in court in six weeks.

29:10.291 --> 29:11.876
If he doesn't postpone it again,

29:12.043 --> 29:15.213
which he does,
because he knows it helps Frank.

29:17.132 --> 29:19.717
I can't get a decent night's sleep.

29:21.010 --> 29:23.805
(SNIFFING) I wish I could take the kids
and move to Europe.

29:23.972 --> 29:26.372
I mean, I actually thought of
taking them out of the country.

29:26.683 --> 29:29.185
What, and hide for the rest of your life?

29:29.352 --> 29:31.062
You'd be a fugitive.

29:31.354 --> 29:35.233
I feel for you, Carol, I do.
And you're such a good mother.

29:37.193 --> 29:39.487
I hope the judge gets cancer.

29:41.364 --> 29:43.241
ABE: <i>He won't get cancer.</i>

29:43.408 --> 29:45.702
<i>Because wishing doesn't work.</i>

29:46.619 --> 29:49.914
<i>If you want him dead,
you have to make it happen.</i>

29:50.748 --> 29:51.916
<i>But you'd never be able to pull it off,</i>

29:52.083 --> 29:55.253
<i>and even if you did,
you'd be a prime suspect.</i>

29:56.796 --> 29:58.756
<i>On the other hand,
I could kill him for you, lady,</i>

29:58.882 --> 30:01.718
<i>and no one in the world
would dream I did it.</i>

30:01.885 --> 30:05.597
<i>I could rid you of this roach
and end all your suffering.</i>

30:06.806 --> 30:10.101
<i>It was at this moment
that my life came together.</i>

30:11.060 --> 30:13.062
<i>I could perform this blessing
for that poor woman</i>

30:13.229 --> 30:15.982
<i>and no one would ever connect me to it.</i>

30:16.816 --> 30:18.485
<i>I don't know any of the parties involved,</i>

30:18.651 --> 30:20.737
<i>I have no motive,
and when I walk out of here,</i>

30:20.904 --> 30:23.072
<i>I'll never lay eyes on
any of these people again.</i>

30:23.239 --> 30:25.575
<i>All I need to know is the name.</i>

30:26.284 --> 30:28.244
<i>Judge Thomas Spangler.</i>

30:36.419 --> 30:37.629
(PANTING)

30:37.795 --> 30:39.297
Are you okay?

30:39.589 --> 30:43.092
(BREATHING HEAVILY) Wow, God.
I got a little dizzy in there.

30:43.843 --> 30:45.428
What, you're shaking.

30:45.595 --> 30:47.138
- I guess, um...
- Are you all right?

30:47.305 --> 30:48.545
An anxiety attack or something.

30:48.598 --> 30:50.808
- I have medicine at home.
- Okay.

30:50.975 --> 30:54.145
(PANTING)
Yeah, I don't know why I feel so dizzy.

30:54.312 --> 30:55.772
(INAUDIBLE)

30:58.107 --> 30:59.776
(PIANO PLAYING)

31:04.322 --> 31:07.283
ABE: <i>Everything about killing
Judge Spangler turned me on.</i>

31:07.450 --> 31:10.495
<i>The idea of helping this woman,
of taking action,</i>

31:10.662 --> 31:12.342
<i>of ridding the world of the kind of vermin</i>

31:12.497 --> 31:15.124
<i>that makes the world
an extra hell for all of us.</i>

31:15.291 --> 31:18.795
<i>I was intrigued by the creative challenge
of bringing off a perfect murder.</i>

31:19.671 --> 31:23.508
<i>It was a high-stakes risk,
but the risk made me feel alive.</i>

31:27.720 --> 31:29.847
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

31:37.146 --> 31:40.149
- Sorry. Hey, you were great.
- Oh, thank you.

31:40.316 --> 31:42.402
- Thank you for coming.
- Yeah, of course.

31:42.569 --> 31:45.154
I've been thinking about that woman
that we overheard all day. Have you?

31:45.321 --> 31:48.366
- Yeah, me, too, yeah.
- It's amazing what happens to some people.

31:48.533 --> 31:50.660
God, I don't blame her
for wishing him dead.

31:50.827 --> 31:52.704
I'd be rooting for him
to have a heart attack,

31:52.870 --> 31:54.247
as awful as that sounds.

31:54.414 --> 31:57.584
No. I mean, don't you think
that there are some people that die

31:57.750 --> 31:58.835
and with their death,

31:59.002 --> 32:02.380
the world becomes
a slightly better place instantly?

32:02.547 --> 32:05.008
Mmm, I don't think it's
quite as simple as that.

32:05.174 --> 32:09.053
I mean, he could be a terrible judge,
but a decent loving father.

32:09.220 --> 32:11.723
- First off, he's not a father.
- How do you know?

32:11.889 --> 32:14.892
I was so fascinated, I couldn't help
but check him out on my computer.

32:15.059 --> 32:16.936
My God, you remembered his name?

32:17.103 --> 32:19.188
Even if he was a good family man,

32:19.355 --> 32:22.859
that's like those, you know,
Mafia bosses who do horrible things,

32:23.026 --> 32:24.746
and, what, we're supposed to cut them slack

32:24.861 --> 32:27.697
because they're wonderful
to their wives and children?

32:27.864 --> 32:31.909
You have to resist the temptation
to overthink a very clear-cut issue.

32:32.076 --> 32:35.955
You know, he's a rotten judge,
not impartial as he's vowed to be,

32:36.122 --> 32:39.083
crushing a woman and her kids
simply because he has the power to do it.

32:39.250 --> 32:41.044
No one can stop him.

32:41.210 --> 32:42.462
(SCOFFING) I mean...

32:42.629 --> 32:45.548
It's not that ambiguous,
even though it's ugly to say it.

32:45.715 --> 32:48.593
He's a roach who'd be better stamped out.

32:52.221 --> 32:54.265
ABE: <i>The dizziness and anxiety
had disappeared,</i>

32:54.432 --> 32:58.895
<i>and I accepted completely, in fact,
embraced my freedom to choose action.</i>

32:59.062 --> 33:00.813
<i>I was too excited to fall asleep.</i>

33:00.980 --> 33:04.734

<i>When I finally did fall asleep,
I slept the sleep of the just.</i>

33:29.926 --> 33:32.095
- Morning.
- WAITRESS: Morning.

33:32.261 --> 33:33.429
Oh, I know what I want.

33:33.596 --> 33:37.934
I want the orange juice, French toast,
hash browns and double bacon.

33:38.309 --> 33:40.520
Hey, what happened to
the usual black coffee?

33:40.687 --> 33:42.188
Can I help it if I'm famished?

33:42.355 --> 33:45.108
Well, bravo.
You want cinnamon on the French toast?

33:45.274 --> 33:47.276
- Yes, I want cinnamon.
- Okay.

33:47.443 --> 33:49.028
ABE: Hi.
RITA: Hi!

33:49.195 --> 33:50.488
Good morning.

33:50.655 --> 33:53.616
Whoa, you're full of energy this morning.

33:53.950 --> 33:55.118
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:55.284 --> 33:57.084
- I made a big decision last night.
- You did?

33:57.203 --> 33:59.288
Mmm-hmm.
To take control of my own life.

33:59.455 --> 34:01.165
Well, that's good.

34:01.541 --> 34:05.795
What prompted this reawakening?
Did you have a religious epiphany?

34:05.962 --> 34:08.214
I just decided it's time to stop whining

34:08.380 --> 34:11.384
and to take matters into my own hands
and make something happen.

34:11.551 --> 34:13.553
Well, that's good,
because, uh, to be honest,

34:13.719 --> 34:15.221
some of us here were
kind of worried about you.

34:15.388 --> 34:17.139
- Huh.
- You seemed at such a low point.

34:17.306 --> 34:19.183
The trick is not to
examine things too closely.

34:19.350 --> 34:22.228
Not to debate every issue,
but to go with your gut feeling.

34:22.395 --> 34:24.731
You know, and choosing action, to do,

34:24.897 --> 34:27.817
rather than to observe
and get lost in conventional clichés.

34:27.984 --> 34:31.654
I think I follow. Philosophy is
not a strong suit, you know, so...

34:31.821 --> 34:32.989
Yeah, I think I know
what your strong suit is...

34:33.156 --> 34:35.074
I'm a little slow.
Oh, really?

34:50.840 --> 34:51.841
I knew you'd love that lighthouse.

34:52.007 --> 34:53.768
It's one of my favorite
places in the world.

34:53.842 --> 34:55.511
Oh, it's so beautiful here.

34:55.678 --> 34:58.431
I can't help thinking of
that phrase by Emily Dickinson,

34:58.598 --> 35:00.016
"Inebriate of air."

35:00.183 --> 35:02.685
To be drunk on air. (INHALING)

35:02.852 --> 35:05.730
Not to have to rely on single malt scotch.

35:07.190 --> 35:10.860
You know, you once said that
you used to fool around with poetry.

35:11.027 --> 35:15.406
Mmm. Yeah, I destroyed
all my poems in a fit of rage,

35:15.573 --> 35:19.869
when my funny, sweet friend,
this guy I grew up with my whole life,

35:20.870 --> 35:23.706
stepped on a fucking land mine in Iraq.

35:23.873 --> 35:25.291
Oh, Jesus.

35:25.875 --> 35:29.295
But you know, maybe if you like,
I could try writing again for you.

35:29.462 --> 35:31.047
I mean, I'm not very good,

35:31.214 --> 35:34.550
but you know,
I might enjoy trying again for you.

35:38.930 --> 35:41.265
You know I'm in love with you.

35:42.767 --> 35:44.560
ABE: You think you are.

35:44.727 --> 35:46.729
What you are is in love
with the romantic concept

35:46.896 --> 35:49.899
of being in love with
your college professor.

35:50.066 --> 35:54.070
The correct road for you is
with that terrific guy you're going with.

35:54.779 --> 35:57.114
Is that really what you think?

35:58.324 --> 36:00.493
I'll always be your friend.

36:00.827 --> 36:03.120
And even your poet laureate.

36:14.423 --> 36:16.092
RITA: That was fantastic.

36:16.259 --> 36:17.760
My God, what have you
been eating for breakfast?

36:17.927 --> 36:21.931
ABE: Aw. I don't deserve all the credit.
You are hot stuff, lady.

36:22.098 --> 36:24.684
What happened to the philosophy professor?

36:24.851 --> 36:27.270
Christ, you were like a caveman.

36:27.436 --> 36:30.439
For the first time in so long, I felt free.

36:30.982 --> 36:33.776
You know?
Just a limitless freedom.

36:35.653 --> 36:37.280
Run away with me.

36:37.446 --> 36:39.282
Where? To Tahiti?

36:39.448 --> 36:42.285
Like Gauguin?
To make love in the tropics?

36:42.451 --> 36:44.829
I want to leave Paul and move to Spain.

36:44.996 --> 36:46.455
- Yes?
- Yeah.

36:46.622 --> 36:48.124
Why Spain?

36:48.291 --> 36:50.877
I always found Spain to be so romantic.

36:51.043 --> 36:52.169
Hmm.

36:54.297 --> 36:56.966
- Now, I have a bone to pick with you.
- Yes?

36:57.133 --> 37:00.469
Yeah, have you been sleeping
with that student Jill Pollard?

37:00.636 --> 37:04.307
I've been sleeping with no one
for a year, till tonight.

37:04.515 --> 37:07.351
Not that I haven't tried,
as you sadly know.

37:07.518 --> 37:10.146
- You tried with the student?
- No, never.

37:10.313 --> 37:11.814
We're only friends.

37:11.981 --> 37:13.482
Well, because there's
talk around the school.

37:13.649 --> 37:15.318
Mmm, it's just talk.

37:15.484 --> 37:18.487
People fill their lonely hours with gossip.

37:18.905 --> 37:21.157
Now put it out of your mind.

37:22.825 --> 37:24.827
ABE: <i>My zest for life had returned</i>

37:24.994 --> 37:28.497
<i>and the driving force of this rebirth
was my rock-solid determination</i>

37:28.664 --> 37:30.541
<i>to perform a service for a mother of two</i>

37:30.708 --> 37:34.253
<i>and rid the world of
Judge Thomas Augustus Spangler.</i>

37:34.420 --> 37:39.216
<i>He lived alone on a pretty street
within walking distance to the courthouse.</i>

37:41.218 --> 37:44.680
<i>One day a week, he played bridge
with his cronies at the Pavilion Club.</i>

37:44.847 --> 37:47.767
<i>He was a member and ate there pretty often.</i>

37:50.686 --> 37:53.356
<i>Saturday mornings,
he jogged at Lippitt Park.</i>

37:53.522 --> 37:56.275
<i>He was not well-thought of as a judge
and had been censured once or twice,</i>

37:56.442 --> 37:58.945
<i>but had never been reversed
on appeal because he was smart</i>

37:59.111 --> 38:01.197
<i>and also one of the boys.</i>

38:04.033 --> 38:05.785
Why continental philosophy?

38:06.202 --> 38:09.372
Because, you know,
continental philosophy deals with

38:09.538 --> 38:14.251
problems much more exciting and,
and personal than the analytic tradition.

38:14.543 --> 38:16.212
You know, the existentialists
were tryin' to find out

38:16.379 --> 38:20.549
not just what does something mean,
but what does it mean for me?

38:21.217 --> 38:23.219
(SCREAMING)

38:26.222 --> 38:30.059
I never thought I would get you
to go to an amusement park.

38:30.267 --> 38:32.103
Where's Roy tonight?

38:32.269 --> 38:33.604
Studying.

38:34.397 --> 38:36.941
ABE: Well, I'm mellowing in my old age.

38:37.108 --> 38:40.319
And now that we're here,
I'm determined to win you a prize.

38:42.822 --> 38:45.741

there was something lighter about Abe.</i>

38:45.908 --> 38:46.909
<i>His spirits seemed up,</i>

38:47.076 --> 38:50.746
<i>he seemed more focused,
more optimistic, more charming.</i>

38:50.913 --> 38:53.499
<i>He said he was determined
to win me a prize.</i>

38:53.666 --> 38:58.087
<i>And after one of his standard lectures
on the impact of luck and random chance,</i>

38:58.254 --> 39:01.257
<i>he managed to pick the winning number
on his first spin.</i>

39:01.424 --> 39:05.094
I want to go with my first instinct.
There's my first hunch, 17.

39:05.261 --> 39:07.763
Okey-dokey, here we go!

39:08.055 --> 39:10.558
Round, and round, and round it goes.

39:10.725 --> 39:14.645
And where will it stop?
Nobody knows.

39:22.111 --> 39:24.071
- I won.
- You're a lucky man.

39:24.238 --> 39:25.781
- How did you do that?
- Luck rules the universe.

39:25.948 --> 39:27.283
Oh, you think so?

39:27.450 --> 39:31.495
Correction, not luck, chance.
We're all at the mercy of chance.

39:31.662 --> 39:33.497
All right, what, what do you want?
What prize do you want?

39:33.664 --> 39:35.499
- Um, okay...
- Anything, anything you want!

39:35.666 --> 39:38.461
Oh, uh, the flashlight, please.

39:38.627 --> 39:40.296
- Flashlight?
- Yeah.

39:40.463 --> 39:42.465
- A nice practical choice.
- Thank you.

39:42.757 --> 39:45.176
- This isn't practical.
- That's not practical?

39:45.342 --> 39:47.136
- No, it's cool...
- I mean, look at your other options.

39:47.303 --> 39:48.471
You're saying that you picked a flashlight?

39:48.637 --> 39:49.972
- I like the color...
- Come on.

39:50.139 --> 39:52.600
I hate that you think I'm practical.

I'm some middle-class drone.

Hey.

No, it's a bad idea.
It's a bad idea.

40:33.557 --> 40:35.677

I think it's a little late for that.

40:41.565 --> 40:43.818
I know.
And I love Roy.

to commit to him and give up...

Listen to me, listen to me.

You don't want to get involved

40:52.201 --> 40:53.869
- Trust me.
- Why not?

40:54.036 --> 40:56.330
I can be just as risk-taking as you.

40:56.497 --> 40:58.874
All right.
We got carried away.

forget the kiss, okay?

41:01.418 --> 41:02.545
What if I can't?

<i>I tried telling myself the reason

55:59.941 --> 56:01.901
I don't understand.
Wasn't it a heart attack?

56:02.110 --> 56:05.405
Yeah, it was a heart attack,
but they did an autopsy,

56:05.572 --> 56:08.199
and it wasn't cardiac arrest,
it was poison.

- Yeah. It was poison.

- You've got to be kidding.
- I know.

56:12.871 --> 56:14.748
Well, what made them do an autopsy?

56:14.914 --> 56:16.458
Well, don't they always do an autopsy?

56:16.708 --> 56:19.544
I think that they suspected that
it wasn't a heart attack right away,

56:19.753 --> 56:22.464
and they just thought it was poison
and so they did the autopsy.

01:00:28.042 --> 01:00:30.461
Yeah, I understand.
That's not fair to you.

01:00:30.712 --> 01:00:34.382
Yeah, I'm just gonna move on.
Whatever happens, happens.

01:00:35.883 --> 01:00:37.677
- Are you seeing somebody else?
- No.

01:00:37.969 --> 01:00:42.056
But, obviously, you are, so,
I'm not gonna hold on from trying.

01:00:44.017 --> 01:00:45.893
That wouldn't be fair.

01:00:48.187 --> 01:00:50.481
It's too bad.
We had a good thing goin'.

01:00:52.984 --> 01:00:55.028
Hey, it's my fault, Roy.

01:00:56.988 --> 01:01:00.074
I'm just really not ready
to commit to one person.

01:01:00.325 --> 01:01:01.492
Yeah.

01:01:03.703 --> 01:01:05.705
Dinner was delicious.

01:01:05.913 --> 01:01:07.513
- And this pie...
- (JILL'S MOM GIGGLING)

01:01:07.582 --> 01:01:10.022
- It's so nice of you to have me over.
- Well, we're happy to.

01:01:10.251 --> 01:01:12.920
Particularly since Jill
always speaks so highly of you.

01:01:13.254 --> 01:01:16.257
Have you two been following
the Judge Spangler murder?

01:01:16.507 --> 01:01:19.093
Have we? We have a special
attachment to Judge Spangler.

01:01:19.427 --> 01:01:21.387
'Cause we overheard
some people talking about him,

01:01:21.679 --> 01:01:22.919
and what a rotten judge he was,

01:01:23.097 --> 01:01:25.892
and we kind of rooted for him
to have a coronary or get run over.

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:28.770
I've jogged in that park with Sally Kelly.

01:01:29.103 --> 01:01:31.823
You know, when I first heard about it,
I thought someone poisoned him

01:01:31.898 --> 01:01:34.567
at breakfast, and it kicked in
when he was in the park.

01:01:34.776 --> 01:01:36.444
But, you know, when I read
it was cyanide in his drink,

01:01:36.694 --> 01:01:38.279
my theory unraveled.

01:01:39.238 --> 01:01:42.367
You know, you were right, Abe.
It was cyanide.

01:01:42.742 --> 01:01:44.452
- Mmm-hmm.
- You said that very early on, didn't you?

01:01:44.744 --> 01:01:45.787
JILL'S DAD: That's what they said it was.

01:01:46.037 --> 01:01:47.957
Yeah, well, like I said,
I always think cyanide.

01:01:48.206 --> 01:01:50.416
Cyanide's the cliché
because it's so quick and fatal.

01:01:50.708 --> 01:01:53.461
Arsenic takes time and is very painful.

01:01:53.961 --> 01:01:55.963
None of the herbicides
are quick and dispositive.

01:01:56.255 --> 01:01:58.132
I don't know anything about poisons.

01:01:58.466 --> 01:02:00.134
I don't, either, just what I read.

01:02:00.551 --> 01:02:02.470
Who'd wanna kill a judge?

01:02:02.804 --> 01:02:04.931
Only everybody,
every person he ever ruled against.

01:02:05.723 --> 01:02:08.267
But I think they looked into
everybody that knew him.

01:02:08.476 --> 01:02:12.230
Including that woman that we heard,
and they were all ruled out.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:14.774
That's why they think
it might be a sick prank,

01:02:14.982 --> 01:02:16.818
or intended for someone else.

01:02:17.777 --> 01:02:18.820
But it was quick-acting poison,

01:02:18.986 --> 01:02:21.906
so they would have to drop it in the cup
right there in the park.

01:02:22.073 --> 01:02:24.075
- JILL'S DAD: Well, that makes sense.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:02:24.242 --> 01:02:25.660
But not an easy thing to do,

01:02:25.827 --> 01:02:28.830
with a total stranger,
in broad daylight, in a public place.

01:02:29.163 --> 01:02:31.833
Unless he was there with
someone he knew, and trusted.

01:02:31.999 --> 01:02:33.501
- A friend.
- A weekend. A weekend.

01:02:33.668 --> 01:02:36.003
A weekend early in the morning,
not a lot of people around.

01:02:37.088 --> 01:02:38.923
Had to be someone he knew.

01:02:39.090 --> 01:02:41.509
But I think they questioned
everyone that knew him.

01:02:41.676 --> 01:02:44.512
- They said it was a regular orange juice?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:02:44.679 --> 01:02:46.347
And he bought an orange juice
there every weekend

01:02:46.514 --> 01:02:49.183
and he'd read the paper after jogging.

01:02:49.851 --> 01:02:52.353
Well, then if it was routine,

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:56.524
somebody could've come around
and just dropped the poison in his cup.

01:02:56.691 --> 01:02:59.152
- Someone...
- You know, he wouldn't be on a park bench

01:02:59.318 --> 01:03:01.112
reading the newspaper, unless he was alone.

01:03:01.279 --> 01:03:02.321
That rules out a friend.

01:03:02.488 --> 01:03:04.866
How do we know it was a man?
Maybe it was a woman.

01:03:05.032 --> 01:03:06.492
ABE: Oh, that's a good point.

01:03:06.659 --> 01:03:08.035
Maybe he turned his back.

01:03:08.953 --> 01:03:12.540
Someone appears out of the blue,
and drops something in his drink?

01:03:13.124 --> 01:03:17.044
Well, aren't those take-out juices
covered with a straw?

01:03:18.212 --> 01:03:22.300
Or someone could have gone to Pascal's
and gotten a juice,

01:03:22.467 --> 01:03:25.553
and put the poison in it
and switched it with the judge's.

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:26.846
Hmm.

01:03:27.013 --> 01:03:28.973
I'm sure the police have
run through every theory.

01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:33.019
Okay, let's say the judge is
sitting in the park with his orange juice,

01:03:33.186 --> 01:03:39.650
and, and along comes someone with
an exact matching cup full of poison...

01:03:40.818 --> 01:03:42.403
- Who comes along?
- And...

01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:44.989
- Well...
- Someone who wants to kill the judge.

01:03:45.156 --> 01:03:46.199
Whoever it was,

01:03:46.365 --> 01:03:48.493
would have to get the judge
to look away long enough

01:03:48.659 --> 01:03:49.702
to make the switch.

01:03:49.869 --> 01:03:51.412
- I mean, they'd be taking a huge risk...
- But think...

01:03:51.579 --> 01:03:52.872
They would sit down next to the judge,

01:03:53.039 --> 01:03:55.333
and the guy doesn't even have to know him,
he just is sitting there,

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:57.502
and the judge is drinking his juice,
you know,

01:03:57.668 --> 01:04:01.672
and he sets it down next to him,
and this person is just...

01:04:01.839 --> 01:04:06.093
The judge opens up his paper, and he turns
and he's covered up for just long enough.

01:04:06.344 --> 01:04:08.179
Well, if he didn't know the judge,

01:04:08.346 --> 01:04:10.264
why would he wanna go
to all that trouble to kill him?

01:04:10.431 --> 01:04:13.184
Yeah, he'd have to be familiar with
the judge's routine, the details.

01:04:13.351 --> 01:04:14.602
But that would be easy.

01:04:14.769 --> 01:04:16.854
You could just stalk the judge
for a week and you would...

01:04:17.021 --> 01:04:19.190
I mean, it sounds like
this was his Saturday morning ritual.

01:04:19.357 --> 01:04:20.441
I like it.

01:04:20.608 --> 01:04:22.968
What Jill says makes sense.
It's a well-thought out concept.

01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:27.114
The judge reads the paper,
blocks his eye line, a quick switch.

01:04:27.448 --> 01:04:29.075
You know, if someone
sits next to you on a bench,

01:04:29.242 --> 01:04:31.244
you often turn away.

01:04:31.410 --> 01:04:33.496
JILL'S DAD: I'm sure the police
are way ahead of us on all this.

01:04:33.621 --> 01:04:34.789
Mmm.

01:04:43.923 --> 01:04:47.218
JILL: <i>The murder of Spangler
remained a hot tabloid issue.</i>

01:04:47.385 --> 01:04:48.469
<i>Abe often talked about it</i>

01:04:48.636 --> 01:04:52.223
<i>and what a blessing it was for that woman,
now that the judge was gone.</i>

01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:54.767
<i>I didn't give any special thought to it,
until one day,</i>

01:04:54.934 --> 01:04:56.561
<i>when I ran into Ellie Tanner, a friend,</i>

01:04:56.727 --> 01:04:58.896
<i>that I sometimes went
horseback riding with.</i>

01:04:59.063 --> 01:05:00.481
JILL: No, no, it's fine.

01:05:00.648 --> 01:05:02.483
- Okay.
- He just, um...

01:05:02.817 --> 01:05:04.277
- Basically, we had this long conversation.
- Right.

01:05:04.443 --> 01:05:08.072
And he said that he felt like
I wasn't being fair to him.

01:05:08.239 --> 01:05:11.826
And he was right. I wasn't.
But I didn't know what to do anymore.

01:05:12.410 --> 01:05:15.288
You would love Abe.
He is so interesting.

01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:17.164
You know Rita Richards?

01:05:17.331 --> 01:05:20.001
Oh, yes, are you gonna tell me
that she had an affair with him?

01:05:20.167 --> 01:05:22.628
Because who on the faculty
has not slept with Rita Richards?

01:05:22.795 --> 01:05:26.132
No, she has this hilarious theory
about Abe Lucas.

01:05:26.299 --> 01:05:27.842
Oh, God, here we go.

01:05:28.009 --> 01:05:31.137
She thinks he would be a good suspect
in that case of the murdered judge.

01:05:31.304 --> 01:05:32.513
You know, the guy who's
all over the papers?

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.432
(LAUGHING) Oh, please.

01:05:34.599 --> 01:05:37.518
- She's kidding.
- I mean, she's half-kidding.

01:05:37.685 --> 01:05:39.353
Oh, come on.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.355
How did she come to
that bizarre conclusion?

01:05:41.522 --> 01:05:43.524
I don't even remember.
We were at her husband's barbecue.

01:05:43.691 --> 01:05:44.811
And she starts yelling about

01:05:44.859 --> 01:05:47.194
how Abe had argued
that the judge deserved to die.

01:05:47.361 --> 01:05:48.613
And then something about...

01:05:48.779 --> 01:05:51.198
I don't know, the aesthetics
of committing a perfect crime.

01:05:51.490 --> 01:05:54.201
- Whatever, she's crazy.
- Oh, she's crazy!

01:05:54.368 --> 01:05:56.120
She's nuts.

01:05:56.287 --> 01:05:58.456
Hey, we should go
horseback riding again, soon.

01:05:58.623 --> 01:06:01.000
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- That was fun.

01:06:01.542 --> 01:06:03.502
JILL: <i>Naturally, I didn't believe
there was any substance</i>

01:06:03.669 --> 01:06:08.549
<i>to Rita Richards' so-called theory,
and yet, for some reason, it bothered me.</i>

01:06:09.675 --> 01:06:12.178
ABE: Here, two poems I wrote for you.

01:06:12.345 --> 01:06:14.138
- You didn't.
- I did.

01:06:14.847 --> 01:06:16.515
- Oh, my God.
- No, don't read them now.

01:06:16.682 --> 01:06:18.002
- I'm too embarrassed.
- (SIGHING)

01:06:18.059 --> 01:06:21.896
If you hate them, throw 'em away.
If they move you, they're yours.

01:06:24.982 --> 01:06:26.734
That's very sweet.

01:06:28.653 --> 01:06:30.696
Hey, is something wrong?

01:06:31.072 --> 01:06:32.406
- No.
- No?

01:06:33.199 --> 01:06:34.909
You seem a tiny bit off.

01:06:35.493 --> 01:06:37.161
No, I'm just moved.

01:06:37.495 --> 01:06:38.537
Without even reading them,

01:06:38.704 --> 01:06:41.415
I'm just moved by the gesture
of you writing these.

01:06:41.582 --> 01:06:43.417
Aw, clever student.

01:06:48.005 --> 01:06:49.507
Are you sure you're okay?

01:06:51.759 --> 01:06:53.761
I'm just looking at you.

01:06:56.389 --> 01:06:57.765
JILL: <i>It seemed absurd to me</i>

01:06:57.932 --> 01:07:01.560
<i>that I could entertain even
the slightest doubt about Abe.</i>

01:07:02.186 --> 01:07:03.270
<i>And then a week later,</i>

01:07:03.437 --> 01:07:06.607
<i>I got a chance to hear
Rita Richards' theory firsthand.</i>

01:07:06.774 --> 01:07:08.109
<i>I ran into her in a local bar</i>

01:07:08.275 --> 01:07:10.111
<i>where she had been
sitting alone and drinking,</i>

01:07:10.277 --> 01:07:12.363
<i>and was a little drunk and talkative.</i>

01:07:12.530 --> 01:07:14.090
- JILL: Hi.
- How are you, Miss Pollard?

01:07:14.281 --> 01:07:16.117
- Great.
- Hi, Kim. How's it goin'?

01:07:16.283 --> 01:07:18.035
JILL: Uh, can I catch up to you?

01:07:18.202 --> 01:07:20.121
- Hello.
- I was just thinking about you.

01:07:20.287 --> 01:07:21.288
I was just thinking about
you too, actually.

01:07:21.455 --> 01:07:22.707
- You were?
- Yes.

01:07:22.873 --> 01:07:24.208
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

01:07:24.375 --> 01:07:26.460
I'm good.
I ran into Ellie Tanner actually.

01:07:26.627 --> 01:07:29.380
And she said that
you had a theory about Abe.

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:33.259
Oh! Oh, yeah, well,
it's what's called a crackpot theory.

01:07:33.426 --> 01:07:36.470
But it's not totally off the wall.

01:07:37.805 --> 01:07:39.390
Well, I love a crackpot theory.

01:07:39.557 --> 01:07:41.809
- Yeah, you promise you won't tell?
- You have my word.

01:07:41.976 --> 01:07:44.145
You wanna hear it?
Sit down.

01:07:45.479 --> 01:07:48.149
You've been following that judge
who got poisoned in the papers?

01:07:48.649 --> 01:07:50.234
- Spangler? Judge Spangler.
- Spangler.

01:07:50.401 --> 01:07:51.652
- Spangler, right.
- Yes.

01:07:51.819 --> 01:07:54.280
Well, they don't know who did it.

01:07:54.447 --> 01:07:59.410
My theory is, uh...
Abe Lucas of our philosophy department.

01:07:59.577 --> 01:08:01.328
(GIGGLING) Our mutual crush.

01:08:01.495 --> 01:08:04.957
Well, you...
That's, that's very, very intriguing.

01:08:05.124 --> 01:08:07.668
Well, it's crazy, but it's not, you know?

01:08:07.835 --> 01:08:09.628
Well, why do you think Abe?

01:08:09.795 --> 01:08:12.673
- Well, once or twice, when I was alone...
- Could I have a white wine, please?

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:16.761
Let's just say in, like, a moment
of post-passionate intimacy...

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:18.261
- No, I understand...
- We'd talk, yeah.

01:08:18.429 --> 01:08:20.598
- You don't have to get too graphic...
- And we both said that

01:08:20.765 --> 01:08:23.434
we had experienced many things in life.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.312
But one thing that he
had never experienced,

01:08:26.479 --> 01:08:30.649
but wondered was
what it would be like to actually kill.

01:08:30.858 --> 01:08:32.193
(LAUGHING)

01:08:33.194 --> 01:08:34.694
- To kill?
- Yes.

01:08:34.862 --> 01:08:38.032
Well, that sounds like random,
silly, Abe talk.

01:08:38.282 --> 01:08:40.033
I mean, you know how he gets
when he's had a few.

01:08:40.201 --> 01:08:41.368
- Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.
- He's dramatic.

01:08:41.535 --> 01:08:43.287
Oh, that's exactly
what I thought, too, you know?

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:44.537
It's just Abe being Abe.

01:08:44.705 --> 01:08:47.457
But then my husband
saw him leaving the campus,

01:08:47.625 --> 01:08:49.710
very early the morning
that the judge was poisoned.

01:08:49.877 --> 01:08:51.712
Like very early, like 6:30.

01:08:51.879 --> 01:08:54.799
I mean, have you ever known Abe
to get up at 6:30?

01:08:55.006 --> 01:08:56.884
He barely makes it to class on time.

01:08:57.885 --> 01:09:01.721
Okay, then your theory is
that he gets up at 6:30,

01:09:02.055 --> 01:09:05.559
and he goes to Lippitt Park,
and he goes up to a total stranger,

01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:08.895
and he drops poison
in the juice of a total stranger.

01:09:09.063 --> 01:09:10.898
I mean, he didn't even know the judge.

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:13.734
He couldn't get that close, and then,
if he knew the judge, he wouldn't...

01:09:13.901 --> 01:09:16.569
I mean, he just wouldn't do it.
He's radical, but he's not nuts.

01:09:16.737 --> 01:09:18.697
Let me give you the final tidbit.

01:09:19.198 --> 01:09:20.741
A few weeks ago, I lost my lab key.

01:09:20.991 --> 01:09:24.245
Now I never lose anything,
but that key was missing from my bag,

01:09:24.578 --> 01:09:27.706
and it opens all the doors
to all the lab rooms

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:31.417
that have all those
dangerous chemicals and poisons.

01:09:32.086 --> 01:09:34.380
All right, well... (LAUGHING)

01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:38.259
You sure have really got
that theory down, don't you?

01:09:39.009 --> 01:09:40.426
- RITA: Like I said...
- I'll think about it.

01:09:40.594 --> 01:09:42.429
I'll weigh it out.

01:09:45.057 --> 01:09:49.520
JILL: <i>There was no question
I was rattled by Rita's outrageous theory.</i>

01:09:50.104 --> 01:09:52.564
<i>I knew Abe had had a very angry reaction</i>

01:09:52.731 --> 01:09:55.568
<i>to the judge's unfair treatment
of that poor woman.</i>

01:09:55.734 --> 01:09:59.405
<i>And what was he doing out at 6:30
on a Saturday morning?</i>

01:10:00.114 --> 01:10:03.242
<i>My thoughts were very
mixed-up and troubled.</i>

01:10:03.576 --> 01:10:06.704
<i>And more devastating revelations
were to come.</i>

01:10:06.912 --> 01:10:10.624
<i>But for the moment,
I lapsed into complete denial,</i>

01:10:11.292 --> 01:10:14.962
<i>and told myself this was too absurd
to even contemplate.</i>

01:10:15.796 --> 01:10:19.633
<i>I must not get carried away
with my overactive imagination.</i>

01:10:20.384 --> 01:10:22.386
<i>And yet, a dark cloud had crossed the Moon.</i>

01:10:22.553 --> 01:10:23.596
- Hey.
- Abe.

01:10:23.762 --> 01:10:25.442
What's on your mind?
What are you thinkin'?

01:10:26.974 --> 01:10:28.267
Nothing.

01:10:29.101 --> 01:10:31.979
I was actually, I was thinking
that I used to come here and jog.

01:10:32.479 --> 01:10:35.482
You know, I'll jog with you if you want.
I'd love to get back into shape.

01:10:35.774 --> 01:10:39.320
(CHUCKLING)
No, you'd have to get up very early.

01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:42.656
I run early and you're a night person.

01:10:42.990 --> 01:10:44.992
Yeah, well, that's why I quit last year.

01:10:45.242 --> 01:10:48.662
That and no will to extend my life,
but now...

01:10:51.957 --> 01:10:57.171
Rita Richards' husband actually
told me that he saw you leaving the campus

01:10:57.338 --> 01:11:00.507
really early, at like 6:30 or something,
on a Saturday morning.

01:11:01.926 --> 01:11:03.135
- 6:30?
- Yeah.

01:11:03.302 --> 01:11:04.929
Oh, yeah, that was the morning
Judge Spangler died.

01:11:05.095 --> 01:11:07.681
Yeah, I had to go to Providence for an MRI.

01:11:08.015 --> 01:11:09.350
- Oh, really?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:11:09.516 --> 01:11:11.852
- You didn't say anything.
- Well, I didn't want to alarm anyone.

01:11:12.019 --> 01:11:14.819
It was a little benign thing,
but the doctor wanted me to check it out.

01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:16.273
He didn't think it was anything horrible.

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:17.942
- I'm glad it was nothing.
- Yeah.

01:11:18.108 --> 01:11:19.944
- Mmm.
- Don't worry.

01:11:20.444 --> 01:11:22.279
- I'm relieved.
- Mmm.

01:11:23.364 --> 01:11:27.034
JILL: <i>It was hard for me
to keep my mind on school work.</i>

01:11:27.201 --> 01:11:29.870
<i>I had this growing sense of anxiety.</i>

01:11:30.537 --> 01:11:34.208
<i>And realizing I always had
a tendency to overdramatize,</i>

01:11:34.959 --> 01:11:37.544
<i>I tried to keep my fantasies in check.</i>

01:11:37.711 --> 01:11:41.340
<i>And still, walking home,
I passed Abe's house,</i>

01:11:41.715 --> 01:11:44.385
<i>and knowing he would be
busy teaching all afternoon,</i>

01:11:44.551 --> 01:11:47.304
<i>I couldn't resist doing a crazy thing.</i>

01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:46.947
<i>Once I was inside Abe's house,
I felt I was betraying him.</i>

01:12:47.114 --> 01:12:49.408
<i>And I felt guilty and stupid.</i>

01:12:50.451 --> 01:12:52.870
<i>I couldn't imagine what I expected to find.</i>

01:12:53.037 --> 01:12:56.957
<i>And yet on his desk</i>
<i>was a copy of</i> Crime and Punishment,

01:12:57.416 --> 01:13:00.210
<i>with margin notes
that had Judge Spangler's name</i>

01:13:00.627 --> 01:13:02.963
<i>and a quote of Hannah Arendt's.</i>

01:13:04.757 --> 01:13:05.966
(BALL TAPPING)

01:13:08.969 --> 01:13:10.429
Oh, are you kidding?

01:13:10.596 --> 01:13:12.264
(CHUCKLING) Jill!

01:13:13.265 --> 01:13:14.808
- APRIL: Hey!
- Oh, hi.

01:13:14.975 --> 01:13:17.644
Oh, you look so pretty.
I love your hair today.

01:13:17.811 --> 01:13:19.646
- Oh, God, thank you.
- (LAUGHING)

01:13:19.897 --> 01:13:21.315
- It's a mess.
- Nuh-uh.

01:13:21.607 --> 01:13:23.233
Um, how's your paper coming?

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:27.488
Good, actually, thanks to Abe Lucas.
I ran into him in the chem lab,

01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:29.740
and he gave me this
whole list of people to read

01:13:29.948 --> 01:13:32.910
to understand those confusing points
that I was talking about, so...

01:13:33.077 --> 01:13:34.495
- He was in the chem lab?
- Yeah.

01:13:34.661 --> 01:13:37.706
He was there after hours.
I really startled him. I felt so bad.

01:13:37.873 --> 01:13:41.001
- (LAUGHING)
- What was he doing in the lab after hours?

01:13:41.543 --> 01:13:43.463
I don't know.
I think he's researching on a book,

01:13:43.587 --> 01:13:45.089
or something that he's writing about,

01:13:45.255 --> 01:13:48.342
like, poison or chemistry,
or one of those things, so...

01:13:48.509 --> 01:13:54.264
But in the lab, all that poison
and toxic stuff is locked away.

01:13:54.848 --> 01:13:56.225
Yeah, but he had a key.

01:13:59.061 --> 01:14:02.815
Hey, why are you actin' so strangely? Huh?

01:14:02.981 --> 01:14:04.024
What's so important we gotta go over it...

01:14:04.191 --> 01:14:06.026
You killed Spangler.

01:14:07.528 --> 01:14:08.862
- What?
- Didn't you?

01:14:09.029 --> 01:14:10.072
- What are you talking about?
- Didn't you?

01:14:10.239 --> 01:14:14.201
You got cyanide from the chem lab,
and you slipped it into his juice in the park.

01:14:14.368 --> 01:14:16.703
You went to Lippitt Park,
you didn't get an MRI.

01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:19.206
- Listen to yourself. Jill, it's me.
- Is that true?

01:14:19.456 --> 01:14:21.375
- Don't...
- Are you nuts?

01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:24.920
Don't tap dance with me, Abe!
I saw in your book.

01:14:25.087 --> 01:14:27.256
I saw that you wrote,
"Spangler, the banality of evil."

01:14:27.422 --> 01:14:29.258
You must've decided that
he deserved to die.

01:14:29.424 --> 01:14:32.678
And so you stole Rita's keys,
and April saw you.

01:14:32.845 --> 01:14:34.388
- Hey, listen, come here.
- No.

01:14:34.596 --> 01:14:35.848
- Come here.
- (GRUNTING)

01:14:36.056 --> 01:14:38.142
I made the choice to help that woman.

01:14:38.475 --> 01:14:39.810
You had it right the other night.

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:42.312
I always said you had a
first-rate intelligence.

01:14:42.604 --> 01:14:45.149
In the park?
On the bench?

01:14:45.315 --> 01:14:49.486
The covering up, the...
Jesus, I felt that, Abe! I felt that!

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:51.580
I always taught you to
trust your instincts.

01:14:51.697 --> 01:14:53.240
Not everything can be
grasped by the intellect.

01:14:53.407 --> 01:14:55.826
If it feels right, it often is.

01:14:55.993 --> 01:14:58.787
This was the meaningful act
I was searching for.

01:14:59.454 --> 01:15:02.207
You can't just take it upon yourself
to take someone's life.

01:15:02.541 --> 01:15:04.626
Well, I thought it was a very
reasonable thing to do.

01:15:04.877 --> 01:15:06.295
She hoped he'd get cancer!

01:15:06.503 --> 01:15:08.422
But what the hell is hoping?
Hoping is bullshit.

01:15:08.589 --> 01:15:10.257
You see, you have to act.

01:15:10.966 --> 01:15:14.344
You can't believe it was moral,
what you did.

01:15:14.511 --> 01:15:16.638
- You don't think that it was moral?
- Of course I do.

01:15:16.805 --> 01:15:19.099
I consider myself a moral man
who's lived a moral life,

01:15:19.391 --> 01:15:22.895
who came to the aid of a woman
suffering a great injustice.

01:15:23.061 --> 01:15:25.939
- So, what, are you gonna go to prison?
- No, the police are not thinking of me.

01:15:26.106 --> 01:15:28.483
You gonna go to prison
for the rest of your life?

01:15:28.650 --> 01:15:32.237
And they never will, because I'm a total
stranger to everybody, with no motive.

01:15:32.404 --> 01:15:35.782
This will be just another unsolved crime.

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:38.160
Do you know that Rita Richards
has a theory that you did it?

01:15:38.327 --> 01:15:41.580
Yes, I know, she told me.
We had a big laugh over it.

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:44.750
How could you do it, Abe?

01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:47.370
Is the world a better place
without this rotten judge?

01:15:47.461 --> 01:15:49.922
- Oh, my God, Jesus, Abe!
- No, I ask you.

01:15:50.088 --> 01:15:52.090
- Is the world a better place...
- No, this is...

01:15:52.257 --> 01:15:54.676
- Without Judge Spangler?
- I am so crushed, Abe!

01:15:54.885 --> 01:15:56.511
I'm completely lost.

01:15:59.264 --> 01:16:00.766
What do I do?

01:16:01.058 --> 01:16:03.769
What do you mean?
Meaning what?

01:16:05.103 --> 01:16:08.273
Meaning that I care about you
so much and I can't...

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:10.525
I can't go on seeing you anymore.

01:16:11.485 --> 01:16:12.653
Oh...

01:16:15.322 --> 01:16:17.366
Are you thinking of turning me in?

01:16:17.783 --> 01:16:20.202
Yes, I'm thinking of turning you in.
Of course I am.

01:16:20.369 --> 01:16:22.079
- Jill...
- But I can't do that.

01:16:22.246 --> 01:16:23.446
I can't bring myself to do it.

01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:25.958
You, you... This is...

01:16:26.541 --> 01:16:27.834
This is crazy, Abe!

01:16:28.001 --> 01:16:30.837
I'm asking you to put
our everyday assumptions aside,

01:16:31.004 --> 01:16:33.548
and trust your experience of life.

01:16:33.966 --> 01:16:35.759
In order to really see the world,

01:16:35.926 --> 01:16:38.220
we must break with
our familiar acceptance of it.

01:16:38.387 --> 01:16:43.225
The second I decided to take this action,
my world changed.

01:16:43.392 --> 01:16:44.601
You saw it.

01:16:44.768 --> 01:16:47.854
I suddenly found a reason to live.

01:16:48.021 --> 01:16:51.692
I could make love,
I could experience feelings for you,

01:16:51.858 --> 01:16:55.070
because to do this deed for this woman
gave my life meaning.

01:16:56.363 --> 01:16:58.365
You have to leave, Abe.

01:17:00.534 --> 01:17:03.412
You gotta go.
I can't see you ever again.

01:17:04.913 --> 01:17:07.416
- I won't say anything.
- (SCOFFING)

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.251
I won't say anything.

01:17:09.418 --> 01:17:10.460
But I...

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:16.425
I believe that you think you did
something morally worthwhile.

01:17:16.633 --> 01:17:18.468
- I did!
- I do believe that. No, but I...

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:20.762
- But you can't, you can't justify it!
- Shh!

01:17:21.096 --> 01:17:23.348
(WHISPERING) You can't justify it
with all this bullshit.

01:17:23.515 --> 01:17:27.477
With all this bullshit,
French postwar rationalizing.

01:17:27.644 --> 01:17:29.813
This doesn't...
This is murder.

01:17:30.105 --> 01:17:31.273
This is murder.

01:17:31.606 --> 01:17:33.650
It opens the door to more murder, Abe.

01:17:34.026 --> 01:17:35.402
ABE: (WHISPERING)
Okay, okay, okay, okay...

01:17:35.610 --> 01:17:38.238
I don't have the intellect
to refute these arguments.

01:17:38.405 --> 01:17:39.781
I can't argue with you.

01:17:40.032 --> 01:17:42.909
But you taught me to go with my instinct,

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:47.039
and I don't have to think about this.
I feel that this is no good.

01:17:47.497 --> 01:17:49.082
This is murder.

01:17:49.791 --> 01:17:51.209
Good job today.

01:17:51.418 --> 01:17:54.254
JILL: <i>The next few weeks
were the hardest of my life.</i>

01:17:54.421 --> 01:17:56.298
<i>I loved Abe and truly believed</i>

01:17:56.465 --> 01:17:59.801
<i>his misguided intention
was to do a heroic thing.</i>

01:18:00.427 --> 01:18:03.388
<i>I argued his position
in my head over and over.</i>

01:18:03.555 --> 01:18:06.767
<i>And at times I weakened
and felt he was an original thinker,</i>

01:18:06.933 --> 01:18:08.977
<i>who couldn't be judged
by middle-class rules.</i>

01:18:11.146 --> 01:18:15.108
ELLIE: You seem so down lately.
Did something happen with Abe?

01:18:15.275 --> 01:18:17.319
JILL: He's leaving the school.

01:18:17.652 --> 01:18:19.154
I guess it's just as well.

01:18:19.446 --> 01:18:21.365
How are you taking it?

01:18:23.325 --> 01:18:24.701
Not great.

01:18:27.412 --> 01:18:30.374
I'm sure Roy will be thrilled to hear that.

01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:31.625
You know, it's so funny.

01:18:31.792 --> 01:18:34.836
I used to think of Roy as wonderful,

01:18:36.004 --> 01:18:38.924
but just very uninspired, compared to Abe.

01:18:40.425 --> 01:18:41.885
And now I'm starting to think that

01:18:42.052 --> 01:18:45.263
I've really been more
suited for Roy all along.

01:18:46.681 --> 01:18:49.935
I guess I'm not as cutting edge
as I imagined myself.

01:18:56.233 --> 01:18:57.818
Is it true?

01:18:58.276 --> 01:19:00.404
I heard that Abe is moving on.

01:19:00.821 --> 01:19:02.197
JILL: Yes.

01:19:02.364 --> 01:19:05.325
- Yeah, that's true.
- I'm going to miss him.

01:19:05.659 --> 01:19:09.996
I guess he found Braylin a little tame
for his restless temperament.

01:19:11.873 --> 01:19:14.418
He's thinking of moving to Europe.

01:19:15.001 --> 01:19:16.670
Can I tell you something?

01:19:17.212 --> 01:19:18.380
Sure.

01:19:19.047 --> 01:19:21.633
I wish he'd go to Spain
and take me with him.

01:19:22.426 --> 01:19:23.552
Hmm.

01:19:25.554 --> 01:19:28.306
You know, he said that
you two had a pretty big laugh

01:19:28.473 --> 01:19:30.642
over your theory that
he was the Lippitt Park killer.

01:19:30.809 --> 01:19:32.769
(CHUCKLING)
We did have a good laugh over it.

01:19:33.478 --> 01:19:35.856
And yet,
if it turned out to be that he did it,

01:19:36.022 --> 01:19:40.819
you know, I'd be surprised,
but not stunned.

01:19:41.361 --> 01:19:43.113
Not flabbergasted.

01:19:45.782 --> 01:19:48.368
I'd still let him take me to Spain.

01:19:50.328 --> 01:19:52.205
ABE: <i>I played out
my last few weeks at Braylin</i>

01:19:52.372 --> 01:19:54.875
<i>and made plans to go off
to Europe to teach.</i>

01:19:55.167 --> 01:19:57.794
<i>I still felt justified in what I'd done.</i>

01:19:57.961 --> 01:20:00.464
<i>I felt that I'd experienced
something unique and deeper,</i>

01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:03.383
<i>from all my social
protests or charity work.</i>

01:20:03.550 --> 01:20:06.636
<i>I'd helped a family and hurt no one,
but he who deserved it.</i>

01:20:06.803 --> 01:20:09.264
<i>A man who took advantage
of his power to hurt others.</i>

01:20:10.432 --> 01:20:12.976

01:20:16.271 --> 01:20:19.399
Well, there goes my theory.
I guess I'll never work for the FBI.

I've been up and back over this
since I heard the news.

"Up and back"?
What does that mean?

01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:12.869
It means that I tried to bring off
the perfect crime,

01:21:13.036 --> 01:21:14.676
and apparently, I succeeded all too well.

01:21:14.788 --> 01:21:17.624
Okay, well, what about all your talk
about moral high ground?

01:21:17.791 --> 01:21:19.876
Look, I need to think this out, all right?

What is there to think about?

01:21:22.128 --> 01:21:24.422
An innocent man
is about to have his life ruined.

01:21:24.589 --> 01:21:26.883
Okay, I'll give myself up.

01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:28.468
Is that what you want?

Okay, if they don't see
that they're making a mistake

01:21:41.106 --> 01:21:43.400
and let him go in a few days,
then I'll just...

01:21:43.567 --> 01:21:45.443
I'll fuckin', I'll turn myself in!

if my luck holds out,

they made a mistake, you know?

01:22:02.294 --> 01:22:05.255

01:22:05.422 --> 01:22:09.134
- I'm not gonna fuckin' make it!
- I know, I understand. I get...

01:22:10.135 --> 01:22:12.053

- First thing in the morning on Monday.
- Okay, okay.

I will do it.

ABE: <i>But I had no intention
of giving myself up.</i>

<i>A few months ago,

01:22:53.219 --> 01:22:56.765
<i>But since I planned and executed
the elimination of Judge Spangler,</i>

01:22:56.931 --> 01:22:59.142
<i>my life had taken a new turn.</i>

01:22:59.309 --> 01:23:00.894
<i>I understood why people loved life</i>

01:23:01.061 --> 01:23:03.521
<i>and saw it as something
joyous to experience.</i>

01:23:03.688 --> 01:23:05.565
<i>I did get pleasure out of living.</i>

01:23:05.732 --> 01:23:09.027
<i>I didn't want to commit suicide,
or spend my remaining days behind bars.</i>

01:23:09.194 --> 01:23:13.531
<i>I wanted to live, to teach, to write,
to travel, to make love.</i>

01:23:15.575 --> 01:23:17.160
<i>That night, I went to bed with Rita,</i>

01:23:17.327 --> 01:23:21.456
<i>and even entertained the thought
of takin' her with me to Europe.</i>

01:23:22.749 --> 01:23:25.335
I would leave Paul in a minute.

01:23:29.381 --> 01:23:32.258
Are you serious?
About Europe, really?

01:23:33.593 --> 01:23:35.136
What if I was?

01:23:39.683 --> 01:23:42.060
I couldn't believe it.
That's, um...

01:23:42.227 --> 01:23:44.062
It would be a dream.

01:23:44.354 --> 01:23:47.816
And start over in Rome or Spain or...

01:23:50.026 --> 01:23:51.277

01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:56.950
<i>Rita Richards, who was never really
serious about suspecting me,</i>

01:23:57.117 --> 01:24:01.329
<i>would see it was another man
and that her crackpot theory was crackpot.</i>

01:24:01.496 --> 01:24:04.416
<i>The morality of letting someone take
the rap troubled me greatly,</i>

01:24:04.582 --> 01:24:08.253
<i>but paled against the hardwiring
of my natural will to survive.</i>

01:24:09.295 --> 01:24:12.632
<i>Europe with Rita was beginning
to have an exciting ring to it.</i>

01:24:12.799 --> 01:24:15.885
<i>Her passion for love and lust
was contagious.</i>

<i>Only one thing stood in the way.</i>

01:24:19.305 --> 01:24:24.185
<i>I had a few days before Jill would insist
I clear the wrongfully accused man.</i>

01:24:24.477 --> 01:24:27.355
<i>Was there a way to keep her from talking?</i>

01:24:27.647 --> 01:24:32.402
<i>I guess she was right when she said
that one murder opens the door to more.</i>

01:24:35.447 --> 01:24:38.241
Jill, I never stopped caring about you.

01:24:38.742 --> 01:24:41.536
It was you who wasn't sure how you felt.

01:24:41.953 --> 01:24:43.830
I was so stupid, Roy.

01:24:44.914 --> 01:24:46.750
I was so stupid, I'm...

If you say you never want to see me again,
I'll honestly say, I deserve it.

01:24:50.879 --> 01:24:53.131
But what happened
to make you change your mind?

01:24:53.298 --> 01:24:55.675
I don't want to talk about Abe.

01:24:55.925 --> 01:24:57.469
I'll never understand him.

01:24:57.635 --> 01:25:01.431
That's fine. I never wanted to talk
about him the whole time, anyway.

God, you're too understanding.

01:25:05.477 --> 01:25:07.353

that you're keeping from me.
