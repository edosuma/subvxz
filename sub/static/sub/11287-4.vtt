WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:04.166
There we go. Uh‐huh.

00:08.933 --> 00:11.133
What are you doin'?

00:11.200 --> 00:14.200
I'm catching the dust
before it lands on anything.

00:15.866 --> 00:17.666
Why do you even bother
to fake it?

00:17.733 --> 00:20.433
Because it annoys you.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.733
Good morning!

00:22.800 --> 00:25.533
Don't even try tellin' me
those things followed you home.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.933
I went to buy Kyle
a plant for his birthday.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.700
I decided to adopt
these others as pets.

00:31.766 --> 00:33.400
Oh, sure,
they don't kick their leg

00:33.466 --> 00:34.400
when you scratch their belly

00:34.466 --> 00:36.266
but the unconditional love
is the same.

00:38.500 --> 00:41.133
Not to mention they don't lick
themselves in front of company.

00:42.700 --> 00:45.233
You know, people live longer
when they're around plants.

00:45.300 --> 00:48.200
‐ Really?
‐ I'm guessing.

00:48.266 --> 00:51.200
Alright.
So, anyway, on my way home..

00:51.266 --> 00:52.966
I got real acquainted
with these guys

00:53.033 --> 00:55.633
and I'd like you two to tell
them a little about yourselves.

00:55.700 --> 00:58.200
Come on! Come.

00:58.266 --> 00:59.200
Regine?

01:00.873 --> 01:02.806
It was dominating
the conversation.

01:06.573 --> 01:08.473
Hi, I'm Khadijah.

01:08.539 --> 01:10.673
And, uh,
I'll be taking care of you

01:10.740 --> 01:12.840
after they cart her
off to Bellevue.

01:14.273 --> 01:15.473
What's that?

01:15.540 --> 01:16.540
What you worried about?

01:16.606 --> 01:18.006
I'm the one
that's related to her.

Up at the crack of lunch.

02:19.746 --> 02:21.146
Do you see any gray hairs?

02:21.213 --> 02:23.680
Believe me, you don't have
to worry about going gray.

02:23.746 --> 02:24.780
‐ Really?
‐ No.

02:24.846 --> 02:27.046
It's one of the benefits
of premature balding.

02:28.346 --> 02:29.913
‐ Yeah. Oh..
‐ Uhh..

02:29.980 --> 02:32.013
[sarcastic laughter]

02:32.080 --> 02:33.246
Uh..

02:33.313 --> 02:34.580
Um, y‐y‐you don't feel

02:34.646 --> 02:35.913
any love handles
down there, do you?

02:35.980 --> 02:38.313
No, I can't feel anything
through that roll of fat.

02:40.380 --> 02:43.346
You should really think
about working for Hallmark.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.546
Is all this funk
about you turnin' 30 tomorrow?

02:45.613 --> 02:47.146
I have no problem with that.

02:47.213 --> 02:48.846
Well, then why do you keep
saying that you're turning

02:48.913 --> 02:51.213
twenty‐nine and three hundred
and sixty‐five days?

02:52.680 --> 02:54.413
I work with numbers. Eh.

02:54.480 --> 02:55.980
Well, then you've known
for some time that 30

02:56.046 --> 02:58.946
is the number right after 29.
What is the problem?

02:59.013 --> 03:00.920
I'm never going to be
a pro ballplayer, okay?

03:00.986 --> 03:02.520
There, now you know.

03:02.586 --> 03:05.186
Oh, Kyle.
Your nickname is Shorty.

03:06.686 --> 03:10.520
Maxine, I am older than almost
everybody on the Orlando Magic.

03:10.586 --> 03:12.853
I'm older than most cops.

03:12.920 --> 03:14.286
Hell,
I'm older than "Boyz II Men."

03:14.353 --> 03:16.420
Look, c‐can we
just change the subject?

03:16.486 --> 03:18.420
Uh, sure. Fine with me.

03:19.653 --> 03:22.386
So, um, what are you
doin' tomorrow?

03:22.453 --> 03:25.320
Continuing to enjoy my 20s.

03:31.220 --> 03:32.753
Well, do you have any idea

03:32.820 --> 03:36.186
what people that we may know

03:36.253 --> 03:39.353
are planning on doing tomorrow?

03:39.420 --> 03:41.953
Is there anything in particular

03:42.020 --> 03:45.220
you would like them
to be doing tomorrow?

03:46.853 --> 03:48.353
Well, I don't want a party.

03:48.420 --> 03:49.786
What kind of party
don't you want?

03:49.853 --> 03:51.853
Um, something opulent,
yet refined.

03:51.920 --> 03:54.853
Something dignified,
yet jubilant.

03:54.920 --> 03:56.720
Sort of like
the election of a Pope.

03:56.786 --> 03:57.720
Exactly.

03:57.786 --> 03:59.586
And whatever you do, make sure

03:59.653 --> 04:01.993
Overton doesn't throw
another bowlin' party.

04:02.060 --> 04:04.426
I don't think I can take
another 21‐lane salute.

04:09.593 --> 04:10.526
Does it ever
bother you that you

04:10.593 --> 04:11.926
goin' out with an older man?

04:11.993 --> 04:14.426
Not at all. I've always wanted
a father figure. Now..

04:16.860 --> 04:19.959
Let's celebrate the last days
of your 20s

04:20.026 --> 04:25.360
by taking advantage
of your waning sexual ability.

04:25.426 --> 04:26.960
Oh, you are going
to regret that.

04:27.026 --> 04:29.293
[Max squealing]

04:35.826 --> 04:38.759
This Dustbuster manual
is fascinatin'.

04:38.826 --> 04:40.260
Did you know that dust mites

04:40.326 --> 04:42.660
are distantly related
to sea monkeys?

04:45.260 --> 04:48.360
Eat, eat!
You're looking so droopy.

04:48.426 --> 04:50.760
What do you want, your leaves
should be eaten by ladybugs?

04:50.826 --> 04:53.193
Your mother's getting upset.

04:57.926 --> 04:59.026
[sighs]

05:00.766 --> 05:02.700
You have sex with a man.

05:03.966 --> 05:06.166
Decide to see him exclusively.

05:06.233 --> 05:08.466
Let him set up a Waterpik
at your apartment.

05:08.533 --> 05:11.566
And all of a sudden,
he thinks it's a relationship.

05:14.133 --> 05:16.000
‐ Is this about Kyle?
‐ Yes.

05:16.066 --> 05:17.733
I don't wanna hear it.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.100
Oh, Khadijah,
that's not very nice.

05:20.166 --> 05:22.033
Well, neither
is this relationship.

05:22.100 --> 05:24.566
Kyle is like a brother to me
and Max is like a sister.

05:26.366 --> 05:28.600
Oh, the whole thing
just turns my stomach.

05:30.700 --> 05:33.866
Well, just the thought of Max
as a sister makes me sick.

05:35.400 --> 05:39.033
The man keeps hinting around
about wanting a birthday party.

05:39.100 --> 05:41.266
And he wants me
to put it together for him.

05:41.333 --> 05:43.266
Well, you are his girl.

05:43.333 --> 05:45.833
He's poisoned your mind too.

05:45.900 --> 05:48.033
Look, this relationship
is just too much work.

05:48.100 --> 05:50.033
You've got to be caring.
You've got to communicate.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.433
You've got to throw a party.

05:51.500 --> 05:52.633
‐ You've got to‐‐
‐ Buy a gift.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.800
Damn, does he expect me
to buy him a gift too?

05:56.300 --> 05:58.466
I mean, I definitely got
to get rid of him by Christmas.

06:00.573 --> 06:03.706
Okay, now,
relax your little green muscles.

06:03.773 --> 06:05.940
Relax.

06:06.006 --> 06:07.906
You know, uh,
you could pretend that

06:07.973 --> 06:10.940
I'm a azalea
just starvin' for sunshine.

06:13.906 --> 06:16.940
Overton, what are you
gettin' Kyle for his birthday?

06:17.006 --> 06:19.106
Shorty and I have a system.

06:19.173 --> 06:22.140
This year, I'm getting him
a heavy‐duty Sawzall.

06:22.206 --> 06:24.940
And for my birthday, I can
look forward to a silk jacket

06:25.006 --> 06:27.373
two sizes too small.

06:27.440 --> 06:30.140
Well, can I get in
on that Sawzall with ya?

06:31.773 --> 06:33.206
Max, you have to buy something

06:33.273 --> 06:35.106
a little more romantic
than that.

06:36.273 --> 06:38.640
Romantic.. A stripper.

06:39.873 --> 06:41.473
Tell me something
that a man wants to see

06:41.540 --> 06:43.173
more than a naked woman.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.073
A naked woman
with Super Bowl tickets.

06:48.473 --> 06:49.773
Naw, what Kyle needs

06:49.840 --> 06:51.406
is something that'll
make him feel better

06:51.473 --> 06:53.540
about turning the big three‐oh.

06:53.606 --> 06:56.173
You know, studies show
that a man's grip

06:56.240 --> 06:59.840
is stronger in his thirties
than any time in his life.

06:59.906 --> 07:01.946
So, I say, we get him
one of those

07:02.013 --> 07:05.780
Lou Ferrigno Incredible Hulk
master grip sets.

07:05.846 --> 07:07.646
That way, he can feel
like a kid again

07:07.713 --> 07:10.780
you know, from the wrist down,
anyway.

07:10.846 --> 07:13.580
Well, I'm just gonna throw
him a party. That's gift enough.

07:13.646 --> 07:15.913
Hey, well, look here,
you just say the word

07:15.980 --> 07:18.380
and I'll whip up
one of my fantastic

07:18.446 --> 07:20.313
bowling birthday parties.

07:20.380 --> 07:22.146
He doesn't want one of those.

07:22.213 --> 07:23.146
How do you know?

07:23.213 --> 07:24.946
He told me.

07:28.413 --> 07:30.813
Okay, y'all,
so, what kind of party

07:30.880 --> 07:31.846
do you throw for somebody

07:31.913 --> 07:33.546
who is dreading their birthday?

07:33.613 --> 07:35.146
Don't ask me.

07:35.213 --> 07:37.280
I haven't enjoyed my birthday
since I was eight years old.

07:37.346 --> 07:38.846
Remember with
the Chuck E. Cheeses?

07:38.913 --> 07:40.246
‐ Yeah!
‐ We ate some pizza.

07:40.313 --> 07:42.446
And then we ripped
the costume off the mouse.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.546
And that's when we found out

07:45.613 --> 07:47.546
that Reverend Roberts
was moonlighting.

07:49.480 --> 07:50.480
Come on, there's
nothing exciting

07:50.546 --> 07:51.513
about birthdays anymore.

07:51.580 --> 07:53.213
When you're a kid,
you get to look forward

07:53.280 --> 07:55.446
to cake and musical chairs.
When you're 18, you get to vote.

07:55.513 --> 07:56.613
When you're 21,
you get to drink.

07:56.680 --> 07:58.046
After that, just pick yourself

07:58.113 --> 07:59.446
up a box of laxatives

07:59.513 --> 08:01.153
get your dentures at the door
and stop trippin'.

08:05.386 --> 08:07.486
Hey! I got a good idea.

08:07.553 --> 08:10.520
Why don't we throw a‐a party
for Kyle like when we were kids?

08:10.586 --> 08:13.720
You know, with balloons
and Pin the Tail on the Donkey

08:13.786 --> 08:16.286
and, and, and Chutes and Ladders
and Candy Land, and‐‐

08:16.353 --> 08:17.620
Candy Land?

08:19.820 --> 08:21.486
A party like that for Kyle?

08:21.553 --> 08:24.186
The man owns an ascot.

08:24.253 --> 08:26.253
Don't be so focused on Kyle.

08:26.320 --> 08:28.853
This could be a way for us
to relive our childhood.

08:29.886 --> 08:31.620
Yeah, alright, good point.

08:31.686 --> 08:33.885
And if this party
doesn't make him happy

08:33.953 --> 08:35.453
it'll at least
work his nerves.

08:35.520 --> 08:38.153
Either way, my job is done.

08:47.020 --> 08:47.986
Okay, check this out.

08:48.053 --> 08:50.686
This is William Shatner
in "Star Trek I."

08:50.753 --> 08:52.520
Two, three, four.

08:52.586 --> 08:58.020
"T.J. Hooker."
Five. "Rescue 911."

08:58.086 --> 08:59.553
You know, we
at least put the photo

08:59.620 --> 09:01.026
of little Kyle in a bowtie

09:01.093 --> 09:03.260
looking like he's about
to sell somebody a beanbag.

09:05.026 --> 09:07.793
Oh, what is it,
my beautiful botanist?

09:07.860 --> 09:09.793
My daisies.

09:09.860 --> 09:13.126
They've gone to the big macrame
plant holder in the sky.

09:14.793 --> 09:16.960
‐ Sorry to hear that.
‐ Yeah, me too.

09:17.026 --> 09:19.493
I was kinda hoping there'd be
no macrame in heaven.

09:21.126 --> 09:23.293
Attention, everyone.

09:23.360 --> 09:24.926
Thank you.

09:24.993 --> 09:28.893
As you all can see, we have
suffered a terrible loss.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.493
But it is Kyle's birthday.

09:30.560 --> 09:35.793
And, um, you know,
the party must go on.

09:35.860 --> 09:41.860
I believe the brothers Vladimir
would have wanted it that way.

09:41.926 --> 09:44.493
(all)
Surprise!

09:44.560 --> 09:46.893
(Max)
Surprise, surprise.

09:46.960 --> 09:51.160
Oh, alright. What do you think?

09:51.226 --> 09:52.726
Yeah, well,
when you called me down here

09:52.793 --> 09:55.460
for absolutely no reason..
Hi, good to see ya.

09:55.526 --> 09:57.960
um, I suspected
it would be a party.

09:58.026 --> 09:59.900
But, uh, what the hell is this?

10:00.700 --> 10:02.000
Smile!

10:05.733 --> 10:07.533
O‐or do that!

10:10.033 --> 10:12.866
Hey, Mr. 30‐year‐old,
how ya doin'?

10:12.933 --> 10:16.300
Woo‐ho‐oh‐oh. You could hurt
somebody with that grip, huh?

10:18.666 --> 10:20.100
Thanks for the Sawzall, man.

10:20.166 --> 10:21.466
And you know,
engraving your name on it

10:21.533 --> 10:23.633
that was a nice touch.

10:23.700 --> 10:26.533
Kyle! Hey, honey,
happy birthday.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.100
Well, tha..

10:35.300 --> 10:36.500
Happy birthday.

10:36.566 --> 10:38.600
It's a money clip
to hold all of that dough

10:38.666 --> 10:39.666
you're going to make
in your 30s.

10:39.733 --> 10:41.133
Ah. Sweet.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.866
And this is to get Regine back.

10:43.933 --> 10:45.300
No. No. No, no!

10:50.233 --> 10:53.300
Hey, Kyle, I mean, uh,
I pretended to enjoy puttin'

10:53.366 --> 10:55.433
this, all of this together.
So, the least you can do is

10:55.500 --> 10:56.933
pretend to enjoy being here.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.200
You know, I'm really
not up for this.

10:59.266 --> 11:01.040
I think Imma gonna go
back upstairs.

11:01.106 --> 11:02.606
Well, you can't leave now.

11:02.673 --> 11:06.073
Um, you haven't
played with the Slinky.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.440
I've slunk.

11:13.940 --> 11:16.106
Hey, hey, hey, birthday boy.
How 'bout a drink?

11:20.006 --> 11:22.840
I fear I'd never stop.

11:22.906 --> 11:25.740
Now, now, no birthday boy
can resist

11:25.806 --> 11:29.173
a game of Barnyard Twister!

11:29.240 --> 11:32.140
Hey, you know you were
the Lafayette Elementary School

11:32.206 --> 11:34.806
Twister champion.

11:34.873 --> 11:37.573
‐ Three years in a row.
‐ That's right!

11:37.640 --> 11:38.906
‐ Oh, alright, one game.
‐ Alright.

11:38.973 --> 11:40.440
Oh, good.
I'll just do the spinner

11:40.506 --> 11:41.973
'cause ever since
I saw that movie "Babe"

11:42.040 --> 11:44.040
I have a real problem
steppin' on barnyard animals

11:44.106 --> 11:45.740
you know.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.440
Go get the cake.

11:47.506 --> 11:49.340
I hate getting the cake!

11:49.406 --> 11:51.906
You've got to keep the candles
burning, lead the singing.

11:51.973 --> 11:55.106
And you get that cake line
across your chest.

11:55.173 --> 11:57.940
Then get your butt
down here on the mat.

11:58.006 --> 12:00.480
I gotta get the cake.

12:00.546 --> 12:03.013
Alright, players,
take your places.

12:03.080 --> 12:06.046
‐ Alright.
‐ You know I can handle it.

12:06.113 --> 12:07.780
‐ Yeah!
‐ Alright, ready?

12:07.846 --> 12:08.780
‐ Here we go!
‐ De‐bee‐dum‐dum.

12:08.846 --> 12:12.580
‐ Right hand.. Cow.
‐ Alright.

12:12.646 --> 12:16.246
Okay, okay. And, now,
left foot, rabbit.

12:16.313 --> 12:17.613
Alrighty.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.613
Not bad for an old fogey, huh?

12:29.313 --> 12:31.446
Yeah, I'd be a lot
more impressed

12:31.513 --> 12:34.280
if your butt wasn't
all up in my face.

12:34.346 --> 12:37.380
‐ Okay! Left hand, pig!
‐ Mm‐hmm.

12:37.446 --> 12:40.546
Oink, oink, oink, go get the one
right next to you.

12:40.613 --> 12:41.546
That's too easy.

12:41.613 --> 12:42.846
This will make me the once

12:42.913 --> 12:45.213
and future all‐time
Twister champion.

12:45.280 --> 12:47.546
‐ Ahh!
‐ Oh..

12:47.613 --> 12:49.413
Oh, my back.

12:49.480 --> 12:52.880
Happy birthday to,
uh, what happened?

12:54.713 --> 12:57.546
Oh, I'm old.

12:57.613 --> 12:59.080
You ain't gotta
tell me that.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.186
This cake can light up
New York City.

13:10.886 --> 13:12.720
Oh, it's a thing.

13:12.786 --> 13:17.486
Kyle Barker
felled by Barnyard Twister.

13:17.553 --> 13:19.686
Man, you shoulda known.

13:19.753 --> 13:22.686
It's one of the unwritten rules
of the game.

13:22.753 --> 13:25.220
Never pick the distant hog.

13:27.620 --> 13:28.753
‐ Oww!
‐ Ow.

13:28.820 --> 13:31.053
Oh! Yee, you really are in pain.

13:31.120 --> 13:33.286
You're just not doin' this
to make me feel guilty.

13:33.353 --> 13:35.286
Oh, that's a load off my mind.

13:36.786 --> 13:38.286
Oh, come on, Shorty,
give me your arm.

13:38.353 --> 13:39.886
Look, when‐when I need help,
I'll ask for it.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.386
I'm fine, I'm fine.

13:43.520 --> 13:44.453
Oh!

13:46.753 --> 13:47.820
See?

13:47.886 --> 13:49.286
[groans]

13:49.353 --> 13:51.820
Okay. Bye‐bye, everyone.

13:51.886 --> 13:53.586
Is there anything
that I can do for ya?

13:53.653 --> 13:55.586
Yeah, you do any more
I'll need an ambulance.

13:57.620 --> 13:59.960
See? We should've
thrown a 70s party.

14:00.026 --> 14:01.026
Oh, but, no, no, no.

14:01.093 --> 14:03.026
He would've fallen off
his platforms.

14:09.026 --> 14:10.460
It's been almost
30 minutes, now.

14:10.526 --> 14:11.993
I don't think
Kyle's comin' back.

14:12.060 --> 14:15.293
Twenty minutes is Shorty's
usual sulkin' time.

14:15.360 --> 14:16.760
After that, he starts to worry

14:16.826 --> 14:18.926
that people might've
stopped talking about him.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.360
Man, I should've
followed my heart

14:22.426 --> 14:24.360
and gotten him a stripper.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.593
Don't be so hard
on yourself, Max.

14:27.660 --> 14:30.493
If Twister crippled him,
a stripper woulda killed him.

14:32.393 --> 14:35.660
Well, you know, I think
somebody should go upstairs

14:35.726 --> 14:37.660
and check on him.

14:40.926 --> 14:42.893
[sighs]
It's one of 'em
girlfriend things, right?

14:44.793 --> 14:48.426
[moans]
I've definitely got
to get rid of him by Christmas.

14:50.460 --> 14:53.193
Kyle has always been so secure..

14:53.260 --> 14:56.026
Almost arrogant.

14:56.093 --> 14:58.326
Okay, arrogant.

14:58.393 --> 15:00.200
I don't know why
he's trippin' like this.

15:00.266 --> 15:03.100
Turning 30 can be
very difficult.

15:03.166 --> 15:05.066
That's why I simply refuse.

15:06.466 --> 15:09.566
Well, personally, I'm lookin'
forward to turning 30.

15:09.633 --> 15:10.933
Why is that, Obie?

15:11.000 --> 15:12.333
'Cause I'm a optimist.

15:12.400 --> 15:15.200
I look forward
to damn near anything.

15:15.266 --> 15:17.866
Well, I know why I'm lookin'
forward to turnin' 30.

15:19.066 --> 15:20.600
Twenty‐year‐old men..

15:20.666 --> 15:22.666
...looking for Mrs. Robinson.

15:26.333 --> 15:28.100
Gone.

15:28.166 --> 15:30.666
They're all gone.

15:30.733 --> 15:33.666
I managed to kill
15 plants in two days.

15:35.033 --> 15:37.033
Well, it's a good thing
you can't kill a ca..

15:40.466 --> 15:42.566
That's a nice pot, Synclaire.

15:44.633 --> 15:46.066
You know, I'm like
the Charles Manson

15:46.133 --> 15:47.800
of the plant world.

15:49.700 --> 15:52.900
Synclaire, don't‐don't think
of the plants as dead.

15:52.966 --> 15:57.666
Think of them as alive
in a brown, droopy..

15:57.733 --> 16:00.873
actually startin'
to smells kind of way.

16:02.606 --> 16:06.040
Well, why me? What'd I do?

16:06.106 --> 16:07.573
What didn't you do?

16:07.640 --> 16:10.773
Look, if you weren't stuffin'
plant food down their roots

16:10.840 --> 16:14.573
you were singin' to them
or trying to rap.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.873
The things committed
plant‐icide

16:15.940 --> 16:17.206
to get away from you.

16:18.373 --> 16:20.273
So cheer up, honey,
don't think of yourself

16:20.340 --> 16:22.873
as the Charles Manson
of the plant world.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.006
More like the Doctor Kevorkian.
Ha, ha.

16:27.606 --> 16:30.540
You ingrates!

16:30.606 --> 16:33.473
I gave you the best 48 hours
of my life.

16:33.540 --> 16:35.540
Well, how would you
like wakin' up

16:35.606 --> 16:36.873
in the dumpster tomorrow?

16:36.940 --> 16:39.540
[cackles]
To the dumpster with ya.

16:39.606 --> 16:42.773
She wonders why we won't
let her get a puppy.

16:42.840 --> 16:45.373
Well, no sign of Kyle upstairs.

16:45.440 --> 16:47.073
You think he could be
in my apartment?

16:47.140 --> 16:49.073
Only if he's torching it.

16:51.806 --> 16:54.240
Someone should go
and look for Kyle.

16:57.673 --> 16:59.806
Me again.

16:59.873 --> 17:02.846
Does my responsibility
for this man ever end?

17:16.246 --> 17:18.012
Do you have four quarters
for a dollar?

17:18.945 --> 17:20.480
What's the point, man?

17:20.546 --> 17:22.546
My life is just like
those clothes spinnin' away

17:22.613 --> 17:26.046
in that dryer,
goin' round and round..

17:26.113 --> 17:29.980
...until they're all dried out
and their time is up.

17:30.046 --> 17:31.646
Thirtieth birthday, huh?

17:33.346 --> 17:34.780
How'd you know?

17:34.846 --> 17:37.146
The "Kiss me, I'm 30" hat
kinda gave it away.

17:40.646 --> 17:43.180
Yeah, it was tough on me too.

17:44.546 --> 17:45.680
Yeah, but with a little time

17:45.746 --> 17:47.046
you were able to get
some perspective

17:47.113 --> 17:49.646
and realize that getting older
wasn't so bad, right?

17:49.713 --> 17:52.146
Not at all.

17:52.213 --> 17:54.280
'Thirty is the turning point.'

17:54.346 --> 17:57.646
After that, it's just
the loss of one bodily function

17:57.713 --> 17:58.780
after another..

18:00.186 --> 18:04.120
...as you make
your slow march toward death.

18:04.186 --> 18:06.153
Yup, agein' is a bitch.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.553
First, my eyesight went.

18:08.620 --> 18:10.520
Then, my hearing, and..

18:10.586 --> 18:13.620
...don't get me started
on my prostate.

18:13.686 --> 18:16.820
Hey, it's as big
as a grapefruit.

18:16.886 --> 18:17.953
I'll tell you.

18:18.020 --> 18:19.286
‐ Liquids'll go in‐‐
‐ Yea‐yea‐yea‐yeah.

18:19.353 --> 18:20.653
‐ But they don't come out right.
‐ Yea‐yea‐yea‐hey‐hey‐hey!

18:20.720 --> 18:21.920
Hey‐hey, hey!

18:21.986 --> 18:23.453
You know,
it's‐it's really nice of you

18:23.520 --> 18:26.053
to do your, your wife's
fine washables.

18:26.120 --> 18:30.953
Oh, actually..
Wife passed in '81, so..

18:31.020 --> 18:32.953
‐ Oh.
‐ These are mine.

18:34.420 --> 18:36.020
See, the one benefit
of getting old

18:36.086 --> 18:38.986
is that you get to do
whatever you wanna do.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.020
There you are!

18:44.086 --> 18:46.686
Hey, what gives..

18:46.753 --> 18:50.120
[grunting]
I didn't think I'd find you.

18:50.186 --> 18:52.553
Yeah, I was kinda hoping
you wouldn't.

18:55.353 --> 18:56.853
So, how's your back?

18:56.920 --> 18:59.393
It still hurts a little,
but I'm more embarrassed

18:59.460 --> 19:01.160
than anything else.

19:06.160 --> 19:09.093
Alright, um, listen, um..

19:09.160 --> 19:11.693
I have a feeling that
mocking you won't work

19:11.760 --> 19:15.360
so, I have absolutely no idea
what to say.

19:16.826 --> 19:18.026
But...

19:19.260 --> 19:21.426
I really want to be
with you on your birthday.

19:25.460 --> 19:27.626
Thanks, Max.

19:27.693 --> 19:29.626
Now, what the hell
is wrong with you?

19:31.360 --> 19:33.593
I don't‐I don't know, I..

19:33.660 --> 19:37.060
I guess I just thought I'd be
in a different place by now.

19:37.126 --> 19:39.060
So, you brought your ass
to a laundromat?

19:40.860 --> 19:42.760
No, my goal was
to be vice president

19:42.826 --> 19:45.326
of the brokerage firm
by the time I was 30.

19:45.393 --> 19:48.826
I was vice president
of my ad agency at 28.

19:48.893 --> 19:51.326
I was up for partner
at 26, alright?

19:51.393 --> 19:53.260
‐ What's that.
‐ Oh, sorry, I'm competitive.

19:53.326 --> 19:55.060
Competitive. Competitive.

19:55.126 --> 19:57.593
Okay. I'm listening.

19:57.660 --> 19:59.933
I mean, you know, I've been
a wonder kid my whole life.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.366
I mean, I was the youngest
in my class at business school.

20:02.433 --> 20:05.433
I was the youngest broker to get
a multimillion‐dollar account.

20:05.500 --> 20:09.000
Hell, I was doing my parent's
taxes by the time I was 14.

20:09.066 --> 20:11.266
Now, I'm just
a moderately successful..

20:12.533 --> 20:16.400
...impeccably dressed
middle‐aged man.

20:16.466 --> 20:17.933
Well, what's wrong with that?

20:18.000 --> 20:20.333
It's not Kyle Barker.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.633
At least not the Kyle Barker
I wanna be.

20:26.166 --> 20:27.933
I guess this'd be a good time
to give you your gift

20:28.000 --> 20:29.100
so, close your eyes.

20:29.166 --> 20:31.700
‐ C.. Wh..
‐ No, close them, close them.

20:31.766 --> 20:33.500
Oh, goodness.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.500
Okay, open 'em.

20:42.566 --> 20:44.166
[laughs]

20:46.933 --> 20:48.900
Alright, so, maybe you
haven't reached every goal

20:48.966 --> 20:51.233
that you set for yourself by 30.
I'm sorry about that.

20:53.100 --> 20:54.700
But, as for your personal life

20:54.766 --> 20:57.200
you know you couldn't
be doin' better. You know?

20:59.400 --> 21:01.706
I mean, if you were
the immature guy

21:01.773 --> 21:03.640
the Kyle Barker
that I first met

21:03.706 --> 21:06.240
who couldn't handle dating
a woman with her own mind

21:06.306 --> 21:08.040
you wouldn't be with me.

21:08.106 --> 21:10.073
So, ta‐da!

21:10.140 --> 21:11.773
Happy birthday.

21:11.840 --> 21:13.840
Cheer the hell up.

21:15.106 --> 21:16.873
Come here.

21:16.940 --> 21:19.106
That was so sweet.

21:24.773 --> 21:27.106
And so cheap. Woo!
That was cheap.

21:28.606 --> 21:32.206
‐ Sweet and cheap, huh?
‐ Yeah. Look at you.

21:32.273 --> 21:33.706
Well, I guess there is
something to be said

21:33.773 --> 21:35.006
about this
gettin' old thing, huh?

21:35.073 --> 21:37.473
‐ Yeah.
‐ Oh, that's right!

21:41.740 --> 21:43.673
Just promise me
that when you get to be his age

21:43.740 --> 21:45.873
that you won't go out
in that outfit.

21:45.940 --> 21:49.006
Without a good set
of pearls and some pumps.

21:49.073 --> 21:50.373
<i>(female narrator)</i>
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

21:53.473 --> 21:54.640
[grunting]

21:54.706 --> 21:56.273
[cackling]

21:56.340 --> 21:58.006
More jars!

21:58.073 --> 22:01.046
Someone bring me more jars.

22:04.080 --> 22:06.280
Kyle, there are no more jars
in this city.

22:06.346 --> 22:07.280
What?

22:07.346 --> 22:09.946
But my aunt Pandora
sent over this box.

22:10.013 --> 22:12.946
Can you open it
with your mighty grip?

22:13.013 --> 22:15.080
She says there's
hope at the bottom.

22:15.146 --> 22:17.080
Stand back, Overton.

22:20.246 --> 22:21.180
Ain't nothin'
in the bottom there

22:21.246 --> 22:23.413
but a little woman
on a windmill.

22:23.480 --> 22:25.080
<i>(female #1)</i>
<i>Woo‐hoo!</i>
