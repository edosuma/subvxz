WEBVTT

00:10.343 --> 00:13.388
Okay, ante up.
One to play. All bets are final.

00:13.972 --> 00:14.973
-Hit me.
-Ooh.

00:15.056 --> 00:16.099
Forward.

00:16.182 --> 00:18.309
-Oh no.
-Oh, you lost. You're bust.

00:18.393 --> 00:19.686
-Juan!

00:19.769 --> 00:22.355
-Okay, Tyricia, flip them over.
-She's confident.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.234
-And twenty-one.
-Uh-oh. I knew it.

00:26.317 --> 00:27.569
-Tyricia wins.
-Yeah!

00:27.652 --> 00:29.863
She's a winner, winner,
chicken dinner.

00:29.946 --> 00:33.158
I would've had a better chance at being
a winner, winner, chicken dinner

00:33.241 --> 00:34.868
if I hadn't gone bust with my egg.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.996
Coming off the ooze challenge,

00:38.079 --> 00:42.000
I decided to take a pretty big risk,
and it just didn't pay off.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.543
I was pretty frustrated.

00:43.626 --> 00:45.503
I know to let go of that stress

00:45.587 --> 00:47.881
'cause that's not gonna help me
get there for sure.

00:47.964 --> 00:51.676
Yeah, I wouldn't think about that.
I just think about literally having fun.

00:51.760 --> 00:52.969
Just do what I like to do.

00:53.053 --> 00:56.139
No, no, you're just vocal
with your having fun.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.684
-Yeah.
-I don't see the lie there.

01:02.395 --> 01:05.315
So here's a question.
If you guys could open up a business

01:05.398 --> 01:08.068
with any class member, who would it be?

01:08.651 --> 01:10.820
Everybody has something,
but I'll pick Tyricia.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.989
-That's a big surprise.

01:13.073 --> 01:17.160
I would pick Tyricia, Juan, and Thiago.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.204
Strong team.

01:19.287 --> 01:20.872
They would make beautiful things,

01:20.955 --> 01:23.666
and I could, you know,
manage everything, just go home.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.336
-Mm-hmm.

01:26.419 --> 01:27.796
With anybody in the classroom?

01:27.879 --> 01:29.047
-Anybody.
-Amaury.

01:29.130 --> 01:30.965
But what about your classmates?

01:31.049 --> 01:32.592
Oh, my classmates?

01:34.594 --> 01:35.428
Mm.

01:36.387 --> 01:38.932
I know what it takes to run a business,
and most of these people,

01:39.015 --> 01:40.850
other than Chef, they don't.

01:40.934 --> 01:44.062
It would maybe be an easy question
for somebody else to answer,

01:44.145 --> 01:48.399
but for someone who's run
every aspect of one for five years…

01:49.109 --> 01:53.071
The amount of love that we put
into that to walk away was hard.

01:53.154 --> 01:55.115
-Really hard.

01:55.198 --> 01:58.034
Financially, it was such a bust.

01:58.535 --> 02:01.121
It was our money.
There was no investor behind us.

02:01.204 --> 02:04.165
We had to give up our condo in Portland,

02:04.249 --> 02:06.126
and then we were…

02:07.627 --> 02:10.797
extremely lucky
to have family who let us move in,

02:10.880 --> 02:15.343
which was, like,
really humbling to be an adult doing that.

02:15.426 --> 02:16.302
Um…

02:17.137 --> 02:19.013
Yeah.

02:21.641 --> 02:22.475
Yeah.

02:24.352 --> 02:27.564
It's scary to think
about eventually saving enough

02:27.647 --> 02:29.607
to try to open something else.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.361
The 50,000 and everything like that,

02:33.444 --> 02:36.156
it's definitely an opportunity to reset.

02:36.865 --> 02:39.701
The timing couldn't be better,
like, from a personal level.

02:39.784 --> 02:41.369
I… I really need to win.

02:42.745 --> 02:44.372
Oh my God. God jam it.

02:47.542 --> 02:51.838
You know, you might win now,
but we'll see about tomorrow.

03:05.143 --> 03:05.977
Oh boy.

03:07.395 --> 03:10.648
-It's just hanging there. It's chocolate.
-Oh, hell no.

03:10.732 --> 03:12.942
-That's incredible.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.528
There's gotta be some metal there
supporting that thing, right?

03:15.612 --> 03:19.449
I don't know how it's hanging there.
There's no way that thing is chocolate.

03:19.532 --> 03:20.617
I… I can't…

03:21.993 --> 03:23.411
Oh my.

03:23.494 --> 03:27.749
-How is anything holding it up?
-I'm stressed about it already.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.793
He is the master of illusion.

03:32.003 --> 03:32.879
Hey, guys.

03:32.962 --> 03:34.797
-Hi, Chef.
-How are you today?

03:38.092 --> 03:40.178
-What do you think?
-Pretty amazing.

03:40.261 --> 03:43.181
If you believe there is metal inside,
you're out of your mind.

03:43.264 --> 03:46.392
-I told y'all. I told you.
-It's all chocolate? Everything?

03:46.476 --> 03:48.811
-That's the only metal part.
-Oh, okay, that's it.

03:48.895 --> 03:52.232
Nothing inside is metal.
A hundred percent chocolate.

03:52.315 --> 03:56.402
So we're gonna find today
how we can defy gravity…

03:56.486 --> 03:57.987
-Gravity? Uh-oh.
-Oh, ha!

03:58.071 --> 04:01.658
…using just the beauty
of what chocolate is, the strength.

04:02.283 --> 04:03.701
When you say defying gravity,

04:03.785 --> 04:05.912
do we have to hang it
from the ceiling?

04:05.995 --> 04:08.748
You're gonna have to hang it
from the ceiling. Hmm.

04:12.627 --> 04:15.546
I have never hung anything
from the ceiling,

04:16.130 --> 04:17.298
especially chocolate.

04:17.382 --> 04:20.760
The only things I hang
is just my plants at my house.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.263
This is one
of my favorite techniques.

04:23.930 --> 04:26.557
We're going to glue those two together.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.685
Because of the way
you're going to laminate,

04:28.768 --> 04:30.937
you're going to get multiple strength.

04:31.646 --> 04:32.981
One strength,

04:33.064 --> 04:35.692
two strength, and then another one here.

04:35.775 --> 04:38.444
So that it's set
from three different angles.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.613
Much, much stronger than any other piece.

04:41.698 --> 04:44.617
We're going to score them
quite heavily, actually.

04:45.618 --> 04:49.497
We're going to warm them evenly
with the heat gun,

04:50.873 --> 04:52.875
apply tempered chocolate,

04:54.043 --> 04:56.838
and then create our little sandwich.

04:56.921 --> 05:00.383
-And apply a lot of pressure on it.
-I love it.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.594
And you're gonna do that
every single step of the way.

05:04.178 --> 05:08.683
If I miscalculate or misapply
one technique to any of those elements,

05:08.766 --> 05:09.976
the whole thing collapses.

05:10.059 --> 05:11.227
Oh God.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.646
It's like having
a weak link in your chain, right?

05:15.148 --> 05:17.483
Laminating chocolate,
that's crazy, and I couldn't believe,

05:17.567 --> 05:22.488
like, that was creating something
that's strong and light at the same time.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.949
He definitely brought the…
the knowledge. Yeah.

05:27.910 --> 05:30.997
You're going to have 16 hours

05:31.080 --> 05:34.542
to design something
that hangs from the ceiling.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.377
-O-M-G.
-Oh yes.

05:36.461 --> 05:39.213
We will have four different groups of two.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.757
Four different showpieces.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.342
Oh my God.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.135
You did not expect that. Ah.

05:44.218 --> 05:47.930
It was a curveball for all of us.
Now we're wrapping our minds around like,

05:48.014 --> 05:50.391
"Oh my gosh, how are we gonna do this
with only two people?"

05:50.933 --> 05:52.018
Let's choose the teams.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.563
Juan, I'm gonna let you pick one person.

05:56.939 --> 05:59.150
-I'm gonna go with Daniel.
-Thank you.

05:59.859 --> 06:00.818
Tyricia?

06:01.444 --> 06:04.155
-Um, I'm gonna pick Stephanie.
-Oh my gosh!

06:04.238 --> 06:06.741
Stephanie's good.
I like her personality.

06:06.824 --> 06:10.703
Definitely do not let
the blond Cali girl fool you.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.538
Like, she… she's smart,

06:12.622 --> 06:14.749
she knows what she's doing,
and she's determined.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.209
Mellisa?

06:16.292 --> 06:18.711
I really don't like to see you
having the lowest grade.

06:18.795 --> 06:22.548
However, I know why you had that.
Because you took the highest risk.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.842
So because of that,
I'm gonna let you pick someone.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.260
-Thiago.
-Thiago.

06:26.844 --> 06:30.390
We're gonna have Amanda
and Cedrick forming a group as well.

06:30.473 --> 06:34.227
-We got this. We got this. We got this.
-No, we can't overthink. Gotta have fun.

06:34.310 --> 06:35.186
Are you ready?

06:35.269 --> 06:37.271
-Yes, Chef.
-Please, begin.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.732
-Go, go, go.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.110
That's what I was about to ask.
I was about to ask…

06:42.193 --> 06:43.861
So we gotta grab what we need.

06:43.945 --> 06:45.696
So, our thoughts is…

06:45.780 --> 06:47.532
Let's just
take some deep breaths.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.661
-My God. It felt so good. We're relaxed.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.788
-We're gonna be Zen and chill.
-Oh gosh. Okay.

06:53.871 --> 06:56.749
Okay, okay. What are we thinking?
What are we thinking?

06:56.833 --> 06:59.919
I was thinking, like,
a hummingbird feeder.

07:00.002 --> 07:02.380
I like that.
A lot of room for structure, support.

07:02.463 --> 07:04.924
You know, like,
I think that'd be cool. A lot of details.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.634
Yep. Could have a lot of details.

07:06.717 --> 07:09.762
I didn't get to work
with Mellisa yet. Super happy about it.

07:09.846 --> 07:12.974
I know how experienced she is,
how long she's been in the industry,

07:13.057 --> 07:16.269
so it felt like the two
older folks are together.

07:16.769 --> 07:18.896
Do you know
what you plan on doing already?

07:18.980 --> 07:22.733
-We're gonna do a bird feeder house.
-Nice.

07:22.817 --> 07:25.361
With an addition
of a little water bath.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.529
Oh, I like it.

07:26.612 --> 07:29.991
The beauty in this piece
will be the detail you add to it.

07:30.074 --> 07:32.660
-The texture of the wood, the fence.
-Yep. Yep.

07:32.743 --> 07:35.538
I'm gonna just concentrate a lot
on all the detail work.

07:35.621 --> 07:40.501
-He's gonna start on the structure.
-You know, I haven't won anything so far.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.212
Doesn't feel great.
You know, you gotta keep at it,

07:43.296 --> 07:45.381
gotta keep pushing,
gotta keep fighting, and…

07:45.465 --> 07:47.008
-Okay. Yep.
-Fridge?

07:47.091 --> 07:51.137
I just wanna keep it clean.
I wanna deliver a clean, recognizable,

07:51.220 --> 07:53.389
beautifully-constructed birdhouse.

07:54.098 --> 07:55.224
It's a lot of chocolate.

07:58.519 --> 08:00.563
This is one and three-quarters.

08:01.439 --> 08:03.774
-What are you… What are you doing?

08:03.858 --> 08:04.817
What's going on?

08:04.901 --> 08:07.278
-We're envisioning.
-I'm trying to get a visual.

08:07.361 --> 08:09.405
I like that you're visualizing it

08:09.489 --> 08:11.574
before you actually transfer it
in chocolate.

08:11.657 --> 08:14.869
We came up with the design
that was an upside-down Christmas tree,

08:14.952 --> 08:16.370
'cause it's more fun.

08:16.454 --> 08:18.414
She wanted it
to be a modern Christmas tree,

08:18.498 --> 08:20.917
so that's why
we kinda went with the ring shape

08:21.000 --> 08:22.793
and the cylinder look of everything.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.587
It's very simplistic.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.172
-And it's not a problem.
-Mm-hmm. Okay.

08:26.255 --> 08:28.132
But when you go simplistic, it has to be…

08:28.216 --> 08:29.300
-Precise.
-Perfect.

08:29.383 --> 08:31.219
After having a good pastry round,

08:31.302 --> 08:35.181
I definitely wanna just do good
and kinda get in the top.

08:35.264 --> 08:36.557
Hopefully it'll happen.

08:37.225 --> 08:40.937
All my zodiac readings say
I'm gonna have a victory, gonna do this,

08:41.020 --> 08:43.648
so I'm like, "Just keep the faith,
Tyricia. Don't give up."

08:43.731 --> 08:45.483
-Separate them?
-Mm-hmm.

08:47.276 --> 08:48.110
Let's see.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.781
First thing we need to do,
build a quick stencil.

08:51.864 --> 08:54.659
-So we get the… the curvature of it.
-Can say it's a circumference.

08:55.284 --> 08:56.452
Amanda and Cedrick.

08:57.203 --> 08:58.162
-"Cedrick."
-Hi, Chef.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.456
-I said "Cedrick." I say the French way.
-Yes.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.083
-Oh, you did.

09:02.166 --> 09:03.626
What are you planning on doing?

09:03.709 --> 09:06.462
A more modernized light fixture,
if you will.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.422
I like the aesthetic of it.

09:08.506 --> 09:09.966
I like that you're using,

09:10.049 --> 09:11.842
uh, what I demonstrated.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.804
I think you're taking a risk
but a wise risk

09:14.887 --> 09:16.305
by removing the center pole

09:16.389 --> 09:20.059
which is gonna be
a see-through final piece. I like that.

09:20.142 --> 09:24.480
I'm used to doing sculptures like this.
I'm not used to defying gravity.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.898
That makes me a little nervous.

09:26.566 --> 09:29.735
-So about… about here?
-Uh, maybe a little bit more?

09:30.236 --> 09:32.446
But I am growing
a little bit of confidence.

09:32.530 --> 09:36.033
Practice those skills over and over.
You just get back into that rhythm, right?

09:36.117 --> 09:38.452
-Failure is not an option.
-That's right.

09:38.536 --> 09:41.330
-I'm gonna make a bit of a mess.
-I see that.

09:44.166 --> 09:46.502
You can go ahead with molds.
I'll go grab the rings.

09:46.586 --> 09:50.381
I really wanna show Chef
that I'm not just good at pastry

09:50.464 --> 09:52.758
but I also have what it takes on…

09:52.842 --> 09:56.679
on showpieces. I'm just tired
of coming second on showpieces!

09:56.762 --> 09:59.140
-You have a sketch of what you're doing?
-Yes, Chef.

09:59.223 --> 10:02.977
We are gonna have the base
which is the trunk, like a bunch of vines,

10:03.060 --> 10:07.356
and then our main piece
is gonna be a chameleon eating a bug.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.611
I love this type of very organic,
blended with sculpting,

10:11.694 --> 10:13.988
that demonstrates a certain set of skills.

10:14.071 --> 10:16.198
I have very high expectations for you

10:16.282 --> 10:20.161
because I love this and I want
to see this in actual real life.

10:20.244 --> 10:21.912
-We do too.
-We won't let you down.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.706
-Okay. Don't disappoint me, guys.
-Yeah.

10:24.707 --> 10:28.044
Juan and I seem to be the, uh,
real chocolate showpiece people.

10:28.127 --> 10:31.172
Uh, there's a different caliber
when it comes to the skill there.

10:31.255 --> 10:33.090
-We got this, Daniel.
-Yeah. Absolutely.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.969
Daniel and Juan
are not the only people

10:37.053 --> 10:38.721
with showpiece experience.

10:38.804 --> 10:42.183
I won gold medals for that,
so I'm very confident.

10:42.266 --> 10:45.436
-Did you measure it perfectly?
-No, that's just to hold this.

10:45.519 --> 10:49.857
Yeah. So, it doesn't matter anyway
because you didn't measure it.

10:49.940 --> 10:52.151
No, but this is the base
where the water is gonna go into.

10:52.234 --> 10:53.194
Plenty of space here.

10:53.277 --> 10:57.281
Yes, but what I'm saying is
you're still not supporting anything.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.617
I… I have a way of doing it where…

10:59.700 --> 11:01.994
-Can you communicate your way, then?
-I'm trying.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.329
-Okay.
-I'm trying to.

11:03.412 --> 11:06.540
We are definitely
both used to being the boss.

11:06.624 --> 11:09.752
If I'm in control of the kitchen,
I like things to be very precise,

11:09.835 --> 11:12.546
but Thiago doesn't work like that.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.592
I hate the floor being supported
by this. You get what I mean?

11:16.676 --> 11:17.802
I do.

11:17.885 --> 11:21.138
-That doesn't make me happy to hear that.
-I know, but think about it.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.557
Everything has to go
in that house before the roof goes in,

11:23.641 --> 11:25.393
and there's gonna be no support
on that roof.

11:25.476 --> 11:28.604
But the braces need to be done,
and then you can trim them to fit.

11:28.688 --> 11:29.647
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:29.730 --> 11:31.816
-Okay. Are we on the same page?
-Yes, yes.

11:32.566 --> 11:34.652
She has
a very detail-oriented way of working,

11:34.735 --> 11:36.237
where I'm rough around the edges.

11:36.320 --> 11:39.657
So, if things aren't done
the way she envisioned them done,

11:39.740 --> 11:41.242
she'll get a little snappy.

11:41.909 --> 11:43.160
You sure that's level?

11:43.244 --> 11:46.706
-The bottom part is.
-No, the box… The box is not level.

11:49.458 --> 11:54.046
If he makes mistakes
in the structural part of it,

11:54.130 --> 11:56.132
we're both gonna go down for it.

11:56.215 --> 11:58.509
-I feel like this bent a little too.
-So…

11:58.592 --> 11:59.510
Damn it.

12:13.107 --> 12:16.110
I'm ready to win this.
I'm kinda sick of seeing Juan

12:16.193 --> 12:17.153
at the top all the time,

12:17.236 --> 12:19.780
and it's my turn
to be at the top right now.

12:19.864 --> 12:22.700
It's gonna be my turn
for sure. Like, yeah.

12:22.783 --> 12:25.077
-Think that's enough?
-Yeah. We're good.

12:25.161 --> 12:28.789
-All right, push.
-Uh, so you doubled the disk?

12:28.873 --> 12:29.957
-Yes, Chef.
-Yeah.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.250
Why?

12:32.543 --> 12:34.920
Well, I mean,
our original plan was to do three.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.006
-Three layers?
-Yeah, but we only did two.

12:37.089 --> 12:40.509
It's very heavy. I thought it would be
just single… single layers.

12:40.593 --> 12:41.802
We were too afraid.

12:41.886 --> 12:44.305
And then we had to show
the laminate technique.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.600
You only need to do
the gluing technique I showed you

12:47.683 --> 12:49.226
when it's structural important.

12:49.310 --> 12:52.646
Look… look how heavy this is,
and you have five layers of it.

12:52.730 --> 12:56.609
If you just do a very strong gluing point
with tempered chocolate, it should do it.

12:56.692 --> 12:58.611
That was both of us overthinking.

12:58.694 --> 13:00.821
Definitely a blond moment.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.448
He's like, "Why would you… Why are you…"

13:02.531 --> 13:04.617
-We're like, "Huh?"
-We're so many things.

13:04.700 --> 13:08.370
Technically, I'm not a blond.
I have dark hair and I dye my hair blond.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.791
-And then that's the mouth?
-Yeah, I need to open it up a bit more.

13:11.874 --> 13:14.960
-Yeah, and then add just a bit of the out.
-Yeah, exactly. The cheeks.

13:15.544 --> 13:17.922
This is gonna be beautiful. I'm excited.

13:18.005 --> 13:22.885
Daniel has this, um,
3D way of seeing things,

13:22.968 --> 13:26.055
which is extremely important
when you do chocolate showpieces.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.098
I see a chameleon.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.184
-I hope you do.

13:30.267 --> 13:32.603
-I'm not making no elephant today.
-That's past.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.814
I'm not making no dolphin either.

13:35.731 --> 13:37.525
-Ha, ha. Funny.

13:37.608 --> 13:38.984
Sound like somebody a little salty.

13:39.068 --> 13:42.112
-Yes. Try to make a dolphin in four hours.

13:44.365 --> 13:47.868
He's amazing, he's on my team,
but I cannot let him take all the credit

13:47.952 --> 13:50.621
and take all the… all the wow elements.

13:52.665 --> 13:56.126
This side is what you'll see.
And that's where I put most of the time.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.628
It's cute. Very cute.

13:57.711 --> 14:00.172
I was feeling left out,
but I can do it too!

14:00.256 --> 14:03.926
I want him to see me the same…
with the same eyes that he sees Daniel

14:04.009 --> 14:05.886
when it… when it comes to showpieces.

14:07.179 --> 14:09.265
-That's really cool, Juan.
-What?

14:09.348 --> 14:10.641
-Chameleon.
-Yeah.

14:14.728 --> 14:16.272
So, they're not super flat.

14:16.355 --> 14:20.150
You just gotta trust yourself and do it.
You can't second-guess it.

14:20.734 --> 14:23.571
-Okay.
-You're now at the halfway point, okay?

14:23.654 --> 14:25.489
-Thanks.
-Thank you, Chef.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.915
I think
we should only have one bird.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.709
Um, up to you.

14:37.418 --> 14:40.546
-Will the bird be happy?
-No. I really don't like it.

14:40.629 --> 14:44.091
It's not really in my wheelhouse,
so it looks terrible.

14:44.174 --> 14:47.386
After just coming off the high-risk-
didn't-pay-out egg challenge,

14:47.469 --> 14:51.390
I thought I, uh… This might be too heavy.
This might be too much of a risk.

14:53.517 --> 14:58.063
So, one thing I notice,
they are, uh, on a straight line.

14:58.772 --> 15:01.775
If you cut the head,
and you bring it here…

15:02.443 --> 15:04.737
-Okay.
-You see the difference already?

15:04.820 --> 15:06.155
Yeah. So don't give up.

15:06.238 --> 15:08.991
-No, I don't think you should give up.
-I was like…

15:09.575 --> 15:11.201
-Thank you, Chef.
-No problem.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.916
By the time you're done,
you're gonna have this mastered.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.084
We're gonna
either love chocolate or hate it.

15:19.168 --> 15:21.754
-Amanda, Cedrick, how are you at?

15:21.837 --> 15:24.757
-We're polishing our butts off.
-We're finessing this chocolate.

15:26.884 --> 15:31.555
I do think we're the dark horse
in this group of, uh, competitors.

15:31.639 --> 15:34.475
Cedrick and Amanda,
they both inherited each other.

15:34.558 --> 15:38.354
However, they're both doing their job
very professional.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.689
No tension. It's quite interesting.

15:40.773 --> 15:45.277
So like this?
We're setting them on top of each other?

15:45.361 --> 15:46.403
No.

15:46.487 --> 15:48.614
Like, the glossy side should go out.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.909
The ugly sides
are gonna meet in the middle.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.204
Okay, you can't keep lifting it.

15:55.287 --> 15:58.624
Just hold it there for a second
to let it, like, firm up. No?

15:59.291 --> 16:01.835
The way they're building that tree
is really brave.

16:01.919 --> 16:04.505
Wouldn't be my method of choice.

16:04.588 --> 16:07.466
Remember, we're gonna glue
the bottom first. Get the heat-- No!

16:07.549 --> 16:08.926
I know, I know.

16:09.009 --> 16:13.389
Telling Stephanie things,
and she not get it the first time…

16:13.472 --> 16:15.516
I mean, she hears you,
but doesn't really listen.

16:15.599 --> 16:18.143
-Here. Don't lift it.
-I'm not lifting it.

16:18.769 --> 16:20.521
You are.
See how you're moving it?

16:20.604 --> 16:23.148
This doesn't have anything
to hold it in place.

16:23.732 --> 16:25.192
This isn't gonna work.

16:25.275 --> 16:26.527
Okay, we gotta start over.

16:26.610 --> 16:29.113
She's telling me,
"You're not doing it right,"

16:29.196 --> 16:31.573
and so it just changed my mindset

16:31.657 --> 16:33.909
to where I was much more nervous
than I should've been.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.203
We didn't have a clear vision

16:36.286 --> 16:38.580
on how to execute the tree itself,

16:38.664 --> 16:40.833
and when we were under the stress,

16:40.916 --> 16:42.876
our… our visions kinda just clashed.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.420
Pick it up, pick it up.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.047
-I'm just like, ugh!

16:47.131 --> 16:48.340
You know, like, this is…

16:48.841 --> 16:52.302
And you look across,
and Juan and Daniel are over there like,

16:52.386 --> 16:55.222
a musical just making it happen,

16:55.305 --> 16:57.307
and it looks so beautiful,
and I'm just like…

16:57.391 --> 17:00.102
I felt like I was being exposed
as, like, as a fraud.

17:04.648 --> 17:08.527
Let's do one base like this thick,
and then the next ones we do thinner.

17:08.610 --> 17:10.863
-Yeah. So we have more movement.
-Okay.

17:12.489 --> 17:14.992
-And then the other way as well, right?
-Correct.

17:15.075 --> 17:15.951
Okay.

17:21.248 --> 17:22.332
Okay. Good?

17:23.375 --> 17:25.419
-Yeah.
-Let it coat.

17:34.011 --> 17:36.096
Just to do…
The little details take so long.

17:36.805 --> 17:37.639
Go.

17:38.515 --> 17:41.226
-Guide me.
-You're in. Yep. There you are.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.689
Tyricia, I like the shine
I see on the ornaments.

17:46.440 --> 17:47.608
Me too, Chef.

17:49.943 --> 17:51.695
-Good?
-Yep. All right.

17:53.113 --> 17:54.156
Now we need to hang it.

17:54.239 --> 17:55.657
You have to have nerves of steel,

17:55.741 --> 18:00.162
especially when we're hanging chocolate
from the ceiling.

18:01.538 --> 18:02.831
Little bit higher.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.375
Push that latch up,
where your thumb is.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.587
It's not a lot of space
to go in there.

18:08.670 --> 18:10.923
Okay. Got it.
All right. Watch that step.

18:12.466 --> 18:14.384
This is the fastest
my heart has been beating.

18:20.933 --> 18:24.394
-Oh! Beautiful!
-Oh yeah! All right.

18:24.478 --> 18:28.065
Yes! It's hanging.
Isn't it inspiring, guys?

18:28.148 --> 18:30.359
-Okay, we're good.
-All right. Let's keep going.

18:30.442 --> 18:32.319
Chefs, one hour to go.

18:32.402 --> 18:34.029
Time to push, guys.

18:34.613 --> 18:37.616
Lose the base.
Hold the top piece too, if you can.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.577
Don't throw me under the bus
when this thing falls.

18:40.661 --> 18:43.580
Setting up that thing,
my goal's like, "Don't want this to fall."

18:43.664 --> 18:44.957
Watch your hands.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.834
I mean,
I haven't been doing good,

18:46.917 --> 18:50.003
and I'm, like, worried,
because if it falls, it's on me.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.631
-Set?
-Yeah.

18:53.924 --> 18:54.758
I'm out.

18:56.343 --> 18:59.847
-We have another piece hanging!
-Yay!

19:02.933 --> 19:05.936
And then, after the water,
will you finish the attic?

19:06.436 --> 19:07.938
-Yes, yes, yes.
-Okay.

19:08.730 --> 19:09.565
Ready?

19:10.357 --> 19:11.358
Ready.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.611
-Bring it up.
<i>-Oui.</i>

19:14.695 --> 19:17.197
-There you go.
-Slow. Slow.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.657
I'm gonna start letting go.

19:19.408 --> 19:22.035
-I'm gonna let go of the bottom.
-That's it.

19:22.744 --> 19:23.579
Okay.

19:24.872 --> 19:28.125
-For Jesus Christmas!

19:28.876 --> 19:30.836
I wanna take that iguana home
for my kids.

19:30.919 --> 19:32.671
-It's a chameleon.
-It's a chameleon!

19:32.754 --> 19:35.048
-It's a chameleon.
-I knew that!

19:37.509 --> 19:40.262
-Are you doing the ornaments?
-I'm cleaning.

19:40.345 --> 19:42.347
We gotta attach these bulbs
to the tree.

19:42.931 --> 19:46.143
-I can't figure out everything.

19:46.226 --> 19:49.521
I was so frustrated
that Tyricia wasn't putting on the bulbs.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.523
I'm gonna start attaching things.

19:59.364 --> 20:02.451
You glued them all
to where the shiny part.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.828
-Can't even see it.
-At least they're on there.

20:04.912 --> 20:07.206
We have to think things through
before we do them.

20:07.289 --> 20:08.957
This is how I thought
about it.

20:09.958 --> 20:12.002
I don't know what to do,
honestly.

20:12.794 --> 20:13.962
Five minutes to go, chefs.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.923
-<i>Oui</i>. Five.
-Thank you, Chef.

20:16.506 --> 20:20.469
-All that glue, you can see it.
-I know. Well, how am I gonna…Yeah.

20:20.552 --> 20:23.430
We didn't think about that,
but had we thought about putting presents…

20:23.513 --> 20:24.431
I don't know.

20:24.514 --> 20:26.767
Don't give up.
Come on. Put stuff on. Help me.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.435
Going into the exercise,

20:28.518 --> 20:32.064
I was hoping to only keep rising
and finish at the top.

20:32.564 --> 20:35.734
So, to get to that point,
and this start to happen…

20:37.819 --> 20:40.739
…you know, it was just,
like, really, really tough.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.867
-Thirty seconds.
-Thirty seconds, Chef.

20:44.868 --> 20:47.329
-Tell me when to cold-spray.
-Let's go.

20:47.412 --> 20:48.497
Ready? And…

20:49.831 --> 20:51.250
Thank you, Chef.

20:52.584 --> 20:53.627
Three,

20:54.211 --> 20:55.420
two,

20:56.838 --> 20:57.673
one.

20:58.298 --> 20:59.466
Chefs, time is up.

20:59.549 --> 21:01.969
Please, present your piece.

21:11.687 --> 21:14.940
-Let me start by saying, congratulations.
-Thank you, Chef.

21:16.608 --> 21:17.943
Everything is standing.

21:18.026 --> 21:20.862
This was the hardest part
of this challenge,

21:20.946 --> 21:22.864
and you all succeeded in this.

21:22.948 --> 21:23.991
Cedrick and Amanda,

21:24.074 --> 21:25.617
can you please step forward?

21:27.494 --> 21:28.328
All right.

21:28.912 --> 21:31.081
-It's a light fixture?
-Light fixture.

21:31.164 --> 21:33.458
-There's no light in it?
-Oh!

21:33.542 --> 21:36.837
-Silly me.

21:40.090 --> 21:42.050
It comes on and off,
just like a light bulb.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.343
-Very cool.
-Nice.

21:43.427 --> 21:44.761
-Yay.
-All right.

21:45.804 --> 21:46.638
High five.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.099
Great little playful addition.

21:49.182 --> 21:50.434
-I like that.
-Thank you.

21:50.517 --> 21:54.396
You guys were the first team
to lead and hang this here.

21:54.479 --> 21:55.314
We just went for it.

21:55.397 --> 21:59.151
I saw you flipping it, and you did it
with a lot of confidence, actually.

21:59.234 --> 22:01.611
Yeah. Don't…
Don't think about it. Just do it.

22:01.695 --> 22:05.866
I don't think you thought this through.
You just went for it, and that was great.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.869
I like a lot of things about this piece.

22:10.203 --> 22:14.082
The fact that it's the only
hollowed-through piece with no rod

22:14.166 --> 22:16.626
brings for me
an extra special dimension to it.

22:16.710 --> 22:21.757
I like that even the little metal hook
is completely blended within the design.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.675
So, I see only chocolate.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.510
All of this, it's nice,

22:25.594 --> 22:28.430
but you could have done,
like, a perfect line.

22:29.473 --> 22:32.809
When you go simpler design,
everything have to be perfect.

22:34.061 --> 22:38.231
I loved your dynamic. You were both
so much into it. It was quite nice to see.

22:38.315 --> 22:39.816
-Good job.
-Thank you, Chef.

22:41.777 --> 22:44.446
-Great job.
-You too. We did it.

22:45.989 --> 22:47.324
Juan and Daniel.

22:50.744 --> 22:52.496
There's so much technique here.

22:54.206 --> 22:59.086
So much texture, color, skills, knowledge.

22:59.169 --> 23:03.048
I like the bark. I like the transparency
of the piece, the fragility.

23:03.131 --> 23:05.425
The color of the flower is really bright.

23:05.509 --> 23:08.011
The beetles,
I love the shine of the shell.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.639
And yet, from afar, I barely see them.

23:10.722 --> 23:13.892
-I think a brighter red would've…
-A brighter red? Oh, okay.

23:13.975 --> 23:15.811
-Then I see them.
-Caught more attention.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.854
Chameleon, spot on.

23:17.938 --> 23:21.024
It's hard to get right proportion
on the first shot like that.

23:21.108 --> 23:23.193
I love the fact
he's eating the little bug.

23:23.276 --> 23:27.656
Still, tongue is a bit messy, a bit thick.
You should've sprayed something smoother.

23:27.739 --> 23:31.827
Imagine it's coming out, it's all slimy,
you… you expect something shiny.

23:31.910 --> 23:34.955
But I love the little guy.
You… you really did a good job.

23:35.038 --> 23:36.748
-Thank you, Chef.
-Good job.

23:40.710 --> 23:42.587
Mellisa and Thiago,
can you please step forward?

23:44.339 --> 23:46.091
I really like the idea.

23:47.175 --> 23:51.012
I know architectural chocolate
requires so much detail, attention.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.889
I love the arched window.

23:52.973 --> 23:56.560
I love that you went
and did the little decoration.

23:56.643 --> 24:00.564
I like that you did some
chocolate technique to make the fence.

24:00.647 --> 24:02.858
The bird, I think it turned out okay.

24:02.941 --> 24:06.945
We know there is improvement to be made,
but I can see a bird, definitely.

24:07.028 --> 24:09.948
I love that the shingles shine,

24:10.031 --> 24:13.452
so it really sticks out
from the rest of the house.

24:13.535 --> 24:16.621
Just trimming them
would have really fully finished.

24:17.706 --> 24:22.252
It was also nice to see you work together
with very strong leadership and vision.

24:22.335 --> 24:24.254
Sometimes it can get messy,

24:24.337 --> 24:26.173
but you… you did not go there,

24:26.256 --> 24:27.883
so I was very pleased by that.

24:27.966 --> 24:29.676
-Thank you, guys.
-Thank you, Chef.

24:31.761 --> 24:33.722
-I told you.

24:33.805 --> 24:36.975
Last team. Tyricia,
Stephanie, please, come closer.

24:38.685 --> 24:41.146
Tell me, how did your collaboration
went together?

24:41.229 --> 24:44.149
Our most difficult thing
I think with this is,

24:44.232 --> 24:47.527
it was, like, internal,
us overthinking everything.

24:47.611 --> 24:50.113
That, and then once
we started actually to get there,

24:50.197 --> 24:54.534
we ran into some roadblocks.
Um, but, I mean, it's hanging, so…

24:55.118 --> 24:59.581
You went with a simple design,
yet very difficult to execute.

24:59.664 --> 25:00.624
For the most part, yeah.

25:00.707 --> 25:03.877
When you build it,
I was a little bit bothered by the sticks,

25:03.960 --> 25:06.338
because it's going
a little bit everywhere.

25:06.421 --> 25:09.799
I would've loved for them to either have
the same diagonal or be straight,

25:09.883 --> 25:11.635
or something that it's telling me

25:11.718 --> 25:15.722
that you… you were able to tame
the matter of chocolate.

25:15.805 --> 25:18.433
You… you bend it to your will.

25:18.517 --> 25:21.561
-I think the chocolate forced <i>you</i>.

25:21.645 --> 25:22.979
I like that you did the bow.

25:23.063 --> 25:26.608
I like that it's shiny.
It brings a little bit of craft to it.

25:26.691 --> 25:30.612
The ornament… Nothing bother you
when you look at the ornament?

25:30.695 --> 25:31.988
-Yeah. I mentioned it.
-Yeah.

25:32.072 --> 25:35.784
So, ornaments should've been tilted
to where the seam isn't sticking out.

25:35.867 --> 25:36.952
Yes.

25:37.035 --> 25:40.330
-I saw you, Stephanie, and I'm like, "No!"
-That was my fault. Yeah.

25:40.413 --> 25:41.414
They were so shiny.

25:41.498 --> 25:42.499
Tyricia, good job.

25:42.582 --> 25:44.626
There's three of them out here shiny.

25:44.709 --> 25:48.255
Also, why using white
to glue on brown bark?

25:48.338 --> 25:51.132
-That's a no-no.
-It was a last-minute decision.

25:51.216 --> 25:53.677
You have, like,
fountain of, like, tempered chocolate.

25:53.760 --> 25:56.096
It was my nerves.
They got… They clouded my brain.

25:56.179 --> 25:59.849
There's room for improvement, it's certain
and you're gonna get better next time.

26:00.934 --> 26:02.435
-We do.
-Thank you.

26:02.519 --> 26:03.436
Thank you, Chef.

26:04.521 --> 26:06.106
I was really disappointed.

26:08.191 --> 26:09.859
It's hard.

26:09.943 --> 26:12.070
Because, um, you wanna do so good,

26:13.321 --> 26:16.366
and to see Chef disappointed
was really hard.

26:17.867 --> 26:20.036
'Cause I just wanna
make him happy.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.663
I just wanna do it right.

26:21.746 --> 26:24.249
You don't wanna do it wrong.
Jesus.

26:27.210 --> 26:28.962
Doing those types of exercise

26:29.045 --> 26:31.715
gives you more knowledge
and trust on chocolate.

26:31.798 --> 26:35.010
You might never do this again,
but the next time you build a piece,

26:35.093 --> 26:38.305
you're gonna trust the strength
of your chocolate more and rely on it.

26:38.388 --> 26:39.973
It's…

26:40.473 --> 26:44.561
Today is very difficult for me
because you guys really raised the bar.

26:49.024 --> 26:50.317
We have a team winner.

26:52.819 --> 26:53.987
Juan and Daniel team.

26:54.070 --> 26:55.030
Thank you, Chef.

26:57.365 --> 26:59.868
This is the one
that gives me the best emotion,

26:59.951 --> 27:01.411
because it's in motion,

27:01.494 --> 27:02.662
because it's playful,

27:02.746 --> 27:03.955
it speaks to me.

27:04.956 --> 27:08.043
So, now let's talk about best in class.

27:09.419 --> 27:12.464
And you know best in class,
it's an overall between the work you did

27:12.547 --> 27:14.090
in your pastry challenge

27:14.174 --> 27:17.594
and the chocolate challenge
as an individual and as a team.

27:18.511 --> 27:21.097
There are three people
I would like to recognize

27:21.181 --> 27:22.599
that, in my opinion, today,

27:23.600 --> 27:28.313
really brought something on their craft,
personality, pushed their limits.

27:29.314 --> 27:31.107
I would like Juan,

27:32.233 --> 27:33.360
Daniel,

27:33.443 --> 27:34.944
and Thiago to come forward.

27:36.696 --> 27:40.116
Thiago did an excellent job,
but that whole piece…

27:42.661 --> 27:43.745
was the two of us.

27:44.329 --> 27:49.125
So, yeah, I was a little bit like,
"Okay, well, it's not really very fair."

27:50.919 --> 27:54.714
Thiago, you went
inside this challenge very focused,

27:54.798 --> 27:56.925
challenging yourself
just the right amount.

27:57.008 --> 27:58.760
I just wanna thank Mellisa too,

27:58.843 --> 28:01.721
because she was a big part
of me kinda focusing a bit more,

28:01.805 --> 28:04.599
taking my time,
getting out of my own head. So, thank you.

28:04.683 --> 28:07.435
And I did not forget about her.
That's for sure. Yeah.

28:08.937 --> 28:11.815
Daniel, you have that right mentality.

28:11.898 --> 28:15.902
Your… Your craft is extremely advanced.

28:16.403 --> 28:19.614
Juan, you really did, uh,
a good job on your pastry.

28:20.323 --> 28:22.784
You really did a good job on the piece,

28:22.867 --> 28:25.829
on your team spirit,
everything you brought today.

28:26.913 --> 28:28.206
The best in class today…

28:31.459 --> 28:32.502
will be Juan.

28:34.671 --> 28:35.588
Thank you, Chef.

28:36.089 --> 28:38.091
I'm just gonna keep pushing.
I'm gonna keep pushing,

28:38.174 --> 28:41.886
and I'm not planning
to let that roller coaster down.

28:41.970 --> 28:45.056
I'm just gonna keep like…

28:46.766 --> 28:48.685
Second time
you get best in class.

28:48.768 --> 28:50.562
So he's the target, guys.

28:52.605 --> 28:57.485
Daniel, if you would've done
something different on your pastry,

28:57.569 --> 29:00.613
for me, it was a no-brainer
that today you are the best in class.

29:01.573 --> 29:05.493
I think you'll definitely see a change.
If I can open this new chapter in pastry,

29:06.119 --> 29:09.414
and as long as I keep doing what I'm doing
with chocolate showpiece work,

29:09.497 --> 29:11.583
I think Juan should be very afraid.

29:16.379 --> 29:17.589
<i>Hey, Mommy.</i>

29:17.672 --> 29:20.175
-<i>How was your day?</i>
-It's just been tough.

29:20.258 --> 29:25.764
I mean, I've been on the bottom
several times, so it's just… it's tough.

29:26.347 --> 29:30.477
<i>It has to be tough, but you're learning.</i>
<i>It's okay to get out of your comfort zone.</i>

29:31.102 --> 29:32.520
And then just knowing…

29:34.689 --> 29:36.649
this could change my life, you know?

29:36.733 --> 29:38.359
<i> I think it's a learning process,</i>

29:38.443 --> 29:42.280
<i>so you're gonna gain something</i>
<i>from it regardless, right?</i>

29:43.114 --> 29:44.866
-Yeah.
-<i>It's okay.</i>

29:44.949 --> 29:47.410
I just want everybody
to be happy and proud of me.

29:48.161 --> 29:50.079
<i> Well, you are fine to me.</i>

29:50.163 --> 29:51.998
<i>You are great</i> <i>to me.</i>

29:52.081 --> 29:54.167
<i>So that… that's all that matters.</i>

29:54.250 --> 29:55.084
Oh…

29:55.794 --> 29:58.505
-<i>You better cut it out.</i>
-I'm sorry.

29:58.588 --> 30:00.089
-<i>No! You--</i>
-I'm sorry.

30:00.673 --> 30:03.426
<i> Look, we are really happy,</i>
<i>and we're proud of you.</i>

30:04.093 --> 30:06.262
<i>Just like you are, pumpkin buzzard.</i>

30:08.765 --> 30:09.724
I mean, this…

30:10.600 --> 30:11.434
<i>Okay?</i>

30:14.103 --> 30:15.480
Crybaby, crybaby.

30:16.356 --> 30:19.234
<i>Please, don't make no more tears!</i>

30:19.317 --> 30:23.154
Um, have you met me?
I'm Tyricia, and I'm a big crybaby.
