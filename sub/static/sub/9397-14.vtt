WEBVTT

00:01.160 --> 00:02.639
<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:02.719 --> 00:04.471
"Congratulations,
your designs have been selected

00:04.560 --> 00:06.790
"to appear at this year's
Rogue Vogue Showcase."

00:06.880 --> 00:10.077
It's like a competition for emerging
fashion designers in New York.

00:10.160 --> 00:12.151
It is my job to come up with
a routine for the tournament.

00:12.240 --> 00:13.912
But the tournament's the same
weekend as Rogue Vogue.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.274
You'll be in New York City.

00:15.360 --> 00:18.238
You made me realize I was ready for you.

00:19.480 --> 00:22.790
I love you, Brooke.
I want to be with you, not Peyton.

00:25.400 --> 00:28.392
I need you to talk to me
about your cancer.

00:28.480 --> 00:31.358
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.391
Ellie? Ellie?

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074

01:23.800 --> 01:27.793
<i>I read a poem once about a girl</i>
<i>who had a crush on a guy who died.</i>

01:28.720 --> 01:32.599
<i>She imagined him up in heaven</i>
<i>with all the beautiful angels,</i>

01:32.680 --> 01:34.511
<i>and she was jealous.</i>

01:35.160 --> 01:37.230
<i>Ellie is gone.</i>

01:37.320 --> 01:40.118
<i>I imagine her with the badass angels now,</i>

01:40.640 --> 01:44.189
<i>hanging out with them in their</i>
<i>black leather jackets, causing trouble.</i>

01:45.160 --> 01:47.116
<i>But I'm not jealous.</i>

01:47.200 --> 01:48.679
<i>I just miss her.</i>

01:51.240 --> 01:53.435
You ready to talk about her yet?

01:54.800 --> 01:57.268
I'm dealing with Ellie's death
the way she would've wanted me to,

01:57.360 --> 01:59.351
by really living life.

01:59.440 --> 02:01.431
And what better way
than road-tripping to New York

02:01.520 --> 02:03.556
in this sweet ride?

02:03.640 --> 02:05.995
And then hopping on a plane
nine hours later

02:06.080 --> 02:07.513
and flying to Charlotte.

02:07.600 --> 02:11.388
- Ellie would've loved it.
- And Rachel is gonna hate it. Win-win.

02:11.920 --> 02:14.354
Are we on schedule, Navigation Girl?

02:14.440 --> 02:16.192
Well, yeah.

02:16.280 --> 02:19.431
Except that we promised
to switch seats once we hit Pennsylvania.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.709
So, H. James-Scott,
what are you more excited about?

02:22.800 --> 02:25.553
Fashion show
or the cheerleading competition?

02:25.640 --> 02:26.959
Sharing a hotel room with Nathan.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.434
- You are so Brooke's roommate!
- Whatever!

02:31.280 --> 02:32.508
Slug bug!

02:40.840 --> 02:42.398
This year's Classic

02:42.480 --> 02:46.029
will not be a repeat
of last year's debauchery.

02:47.280 --> 02:49.430
There'll be an 11:00 curfew.

02:49.520 --> 02:53.399
That means there'll be
no late-night hot-tubbing,

02:53.960 --> 02:57.396
no spinning the bottle,
no truthing or daring.

02:57.880 --> 03:00.678
And that includes the chaperones.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.393
Your mom playing grab-ass on the bus

03:08.480 --> 03:11.040
isn't as humiliating as Dan assaulting me
in the locker room.

03:11.120 --> 03:14.032
- Where is Dan?
- Official mayor stuff in Tree Hill.

03:14.120 --> 03:16.509
He's probably planning
an invasion of Raleigh.

03:16.600 --> 03:19.751
- More pressure off you, then.
- Actually, I play better when Dan's there.

03:19.840 --> 03:21.796
What, some kind
of twisted good luck charm?

03:21.880 --> 03:23.791
No. More like a gun to the head.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.668
Okay, my turn. O, Wise Radio,

03:30.760 --> 03:33.593
what is gonna happen to me in New York
at the Rogue Vogue fashion show?

03:33.680 --> 03:34.829
That was the first question you asked,

03:34.920 --> 03:36.239
and you can't ask
the same question twice.

03:36.320 --> 03:37.435
Well, I didn't like my answer.

03:37.520 --> 03:39.715
And it's not like only one thing
can happen at a fashion show.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.870
Yeah, but it defeats the purpose
of the radio game.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.554
It's like Magic 8-Ball.
You have to take the first answer you get.

03:44.640 --> 03:46.756
Yeah. I didn't get a do-over
when the answer to my question,

03:46.840 --> 03:49.400
"What will happen with me and Nathan,"
was <i>Highway to Hell,</i> okay?

03:49.480 --> 03:52.153
Fine. I will accept that
at some point this weekend,

03:52.240 --> 03:55.118
someone will <i>Pour Some Sugar On Me.</i>

03:55.200 --> 03:58.192
But my next question is,
what is Lucas thinking about

03:59.040 --> 04:00.393
right now?

04:00.720 --> 04:03.917
<i>Torn between two lovers</i>

04:05.360 --> 04:07.954
- Okay, new game.
- How about movie quotes?

04:08.040 --> 04:09.712
- Great.
- I'll go first.

04:10.840 --> 04:13.673
"If I ever start talking about these
as the best days of my life,

04:13.760 --> 04:16.353
- "remind me to kill myself."
<i>- Dazed and Confused.</i>

04:16.720 --> 04:18.596
Oh, my God, you guys, look!

04:21.480 --> 04:22.833
That's just like the movies.

04:22.920 --> 04:24.638
Peyton, we need music. Plug in the iPod.

04:25.360 --> 04:26.634
Cue the soundtrack.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.236
All right, girls. One hour to check in.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.311
Everyone assembled for practice at 3:00,

04:40.400 --> 04:42.630
break at 6:00, final rehearsal, 8:30.

04:42.720 --> 04:45.154
- Lights out at 10:00.
- You know, Brooke was never this strict.

04:45.240 --> 04:47.800
She always let us do what we wanted
before the competition.

04:47.880 --> 04:50.792
Do I look like Brooke to you?
Thank God, no.

04:50.880 --> 04:52.632
Well, I don't feel good.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.236
I'm gonna go try to squeeze in a nap.

05:03.520 --> 05:07.035
How stinking great is this?

05:07.120 --> 05:09.509
- Thanks for coming with me, team.
- Yeah.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.156
Guys, guys, this is Rogue Vogue,
not prom.

05:14.240 --> 05:17.312
Would you please, please get rid of
those astoundingly repulsive streamers

05:17.400 --> 05:18.753
before I hang you by them?

05:18.840 --> 05:20.068
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:20.160 --> 05:22.515
Excuse me, I'm Brooke Davis
and I just wanted to check on my time.

05:22.600 --> 05:25.672
I have a little bit of a schedule crunch
'cause we're trying to hop a flight tonight

05:25.760 --> 05:27.716
back to North Carolina
for a cheerleading competition tomorrow.

05:27.800 --> 05:30.633
My two best friends drove down with me,
and I'm in love with them for it,

05:30.720 --> 05:34.315
- but we wanted to fly back together...
- You know, the schedule has changed.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.753
Okay, good change or bad change?

05:37.480 --> 05:38.913
Your clothes don't show until tomorrow.

05:40.280 --> 05:41.713
That's a bad change.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.358
Yeah. Looks like you have
a cheer-cision to make.

05:49.920 --> 05:52.150
I cannot believe that director lady.
I hate her.

05:52.240 --> 05:54.515
She was wearing white
and it's way after Veterans Day.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.955
- Labor Day.
- Whatever, Almanac Girl.

05:57.040 --> 05:58.189
You guys, what am I gonna do?

05:58.280 --> 05:59.838
Could we get me a radio
so I can make up my mind?

05:59.920 --> 06:01.831
Okay, Donatella, get yourself together.

06:02.480 --> 06:05.995
You've never worked so hard at anything
in your life, except your fake ID.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.271
It's your big chance.

06:09.040 --> 06:10.029
Yeah.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.473
- You guys should go without me.
- You sure?

06:14.560 --> 06:17.358
Yeah. Peyton's right, it's my big shot.

06:17.960 --> 06:18.949
So...

06:19.360 --> 06:20.952
Just go before I change my mind.

06:21.560 --> 06:23.835
- You have fun.
- Good luck.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.796
Oh, wow, Keith.

06:41.560 --> 06:42.549
Wow.

06:43.640 --> 06:45.551
Those are gorgeous.

06:45.960 --> 06:47.951
And you should see the view.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.993
Oh, and the bathroom, it comes with one...

06:53.200 --> 06:54.349
Crusty old man.

06:54.440 --> 06:57.637
That Jacuzzi's gonna do wonders
for my back.

06:58.160 --> 06:59.991
Whitey, what are you doing in our room?

07:00.080 --> 07:01.798
Don't you mean our room?

07:01.880 --> 07:05.475
The two of you shacked up together in sin,
that's a bad example to the children.

07:05.560 --> 07:08.154
- You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
- But...

07:08.240 --> 07:11.277
Well, don't worry, Karen.
I'll take good care of him.

07:11.360 --> 07:12.759
Well, what do we got here?

07:15.120 --> 07:16.394
Truffles.

07:16.720 --> 07:18.870
Isn't that romantic?

07:36.000 --> 07:38.639
- Paper covers rock.
- Two out of three?

07:43.640 --> 07:46.154
- Room service.
- Wrong room, sorry.

07:46.240 --> 07:49.312
Man, if you don't come open up
this door before I kick it down...

07:53.320 --> 07:54.594
Big Time!

07:54.680 --> 07:56.511
Tony Battle.
What are you doing here, man?

07:56.600 --> 07:58.113
I live in the town next over, man.

07:58.200 --> 08:00.794
So, now I get to beat your ass
in a tournament, not just one-on-one.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.949
- Well, hey, man, this is Lucas.
- What's up, man?

08:04.040 --> 08:08.272
Heard about you. Jump shooter right?
Went to see Nate's girl, lied about it.

08:08.360 --> 08:09.679
God.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.751
So, I know y'all down
to kick it tonight, right?

08:12.640 --> 08:15.108
I don't know if we can do
a wild night, man. We got a curfew.

08:15.200 --> 08:17.634
Okay, cool.
So then we'll make it an early wild night.

08:17.720 --> 08:18.914
Get your stuff. Let's roll.

08:26.560 --> 08:30.109
- Bevin, let me in!
- I can't. I have an enormous fever.

08:30.200 --> 08:32.350
You're gonna have to stay
with someone else.

08:36.159 --> 08:39.470
- Thanks for driving up for the weekend.
- Damn, baby, you look hot.

08:39.559 --> 08:42.232
No, I don't really have a fever.
That was a lie.

08:58.880 --> 09:02.190
Hi, excuse me.
It's just a little crazy in here.

09:02.680 --> 09:06.036
I'm looking for the model for my clothes.
I'm a designer. My name's Brooke Davis.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.509
- I have...
- I'm your model.

09:08.600 --> 09:09.828
Solaris.

09:09.920 --> 09:13.151
Solaris. Cool.
Sorry, I'm a little overwhelmed.

09:13.240 --> 09:15.515
I'm still in high school,
and this is all really new to me.

09:15.600 --> 09:19.388
I know. Everyone here is, like, 30.
I am literally half their age.

09:19.760 --> 09:23.309
So you're 15,
or just really bad at math like me?

09:23.400 --> 09:27.075
Both. I'm really bad at math and 15.

09:27.720 --> 09:30.792
- I thought you were, like, 25.
- Yeah, you and every bartender in the city.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.154
Nice.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.755
I am really excited that
there's another kid here, though.

09:35.840 --> 09:38.673
- I totally miss my friends already.
- Well, you should be psyched.

09:38.760 --> 09:42.036
Your line is so awesome.
I would actually wear it.

09:42.120 --> 09:45.157
Like, my friend Jessica has to model
a shirt made of tacks.

09:45.240 --> 09:46.434
Ouch.

09:47.760 --> 09:49.637
Do you have plans tonight?

09:50.680 --> 09:52.238
Well, you do now.

09:52.400 --> 09:55.073
Get ready for a wild night,
designer Brooke.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.715
You took me to some pretty wild
parties this summer, Battle,

09:58.800 --> 10:00.392
but I think you're outdoing yourself here.

10:00.480 --> 10:01.754
Hey, you'll see.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.558
He don't look like he got game.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.469
Bevin! Quit making an "L"
before you do that move.

10:17.560 --> 10:19.516
It's the only way I can remember
it's left, and not right.

10:19.600 --> 10:22.512
Well, stop. It looks like you're making
the "loser" sign.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.951
Hey, you guys, I'm sorry we're late.

10:29.640 --> 10:32.279
Thank God you guys are here.
Where's Brooke?

10:33.760 --> 10:36.991
Brooke got delayed at the fashion show.
She's not coming.

10:37.080 --> 10:39.230
Well, we'll just have to forge ahead
without her.

10:39.320 --> 10:41.959
All right, team, everyone to your rooms.
Let's get some rest for tomorrow.

10:42.040 --> 10:44.315
Gotta rest! So sleepy. Bye!

10:45.840 --> 10:48.912
Hey, give me a call if you need
anything at all, okay?

10:49.320 --> 10:52.278
Thanks, Haley. I know you're excited
about spending time with Nathan, though,

10:52.360 --> 10:53.475
so don't worry about me.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.469
Okay.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.953
Well, look, I'm not much of a listener,

11:00.040 --> 11:02.429
but I do have some tequila in my room.
You interested?

11:02.520 --> 11:03.748
Perfect.

11:22.720 --> 11:25.553
- Solaris! I love you.
- You look fantastic.

11:26.360 --> 11:28.954
This is Brooke Davis.
I'm modeling her line tomorrow.

11:29.040 --> 11:32.112
- Do you have a cigarette?
- No, I quit.

11:32.200 --> 11:33.952
You bitch. Love you.

11:37.160 --> 11:40.357
Sad. Ever since she got a rib
taken out a year ago,

11:40.440 --> 11:43.716
and those horrible collagen
lip injections, she's totally washed up.

11:43.800 --> 11:44.994
Cheers!

11:50.640 --> 11:52.995
Kind of weird, us hanging out.

11:53.480 --> 11:57.268
Nothing personal, I just never
imagined the two of us kicking it.

11:57.360 --> 12:00.033
Well, we probably have a lot more
in common than you think.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.998
Then again, we'll probably
never get the chance to find out.

12:03.080 --> 12:06.470
I mean, I'm not Brooke's favorite person
and you are.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.788
She just doesn't trust you.

12:08.920 --> 12:10.035
And you do?

12:10.720 --> 12:13.280
Not really, I just wanted a drink.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.115
<i>Hey, it's Bevin.</i>

12:20.200 --> 12:23.556
Peyton's not in her room right now,
unlike me, who's, like, totally asleep.

12:23.640 --> 12:26.438
Anyway, if you see her,
will you tell her she's bunking with you?

12:26.520 --> 12:27.589
What? Why?

12:27.680 --> 12:30.558
<i>Because Haley switched rooms with Lucas</i>
<i>so she could be with Nathan.</i>

12:30.640 --> 12:33.234
Now Lucas is in Peyton's room
because Brooke's not coming,

12:33.320 --> 12:36.471
but of course we can't put a girl in
with Lucas, especially Peyton.

12:36.560 --> 12:38.710
<i>So, Lucas goes there,</i>
<i>Peyton goes in with you.</i>

12:38.800 --> 12:41.951
Chelsea is staying with Ashley,
because I'm really sick.

12:43.280 --> 12:46.477
Long story short, Peyton's in with you.
Lucas is alone in her room.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.917
Okay, yeah, fine. I'll tell her.

12:49.080 --> 12:51.548
And tell Skills "hi" for me.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.429
What's up?

12:55.800 --> 12:59.634
Bevin wants me to remind you to bring
your flatiron to her in the morning.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.033
Rachel says "hey."

13:02.120 --> 13:03.439
Wait a minute.

13:04.640 --> 13:08.792
- Well, you ready for a swim?
- Yeah, the Jacuzzi looking real good.

13:08.880 --> 13:12.555
- Well, let's swim first.
- Nah, I'm good.

13:12.680 --> 13:14.352
Skills, come on.

13:15.440 --> 13:18.512
Oh, my God,
do you not know how to swim?

13:18.600 --> 13:22.388
What the hell kind of question is that?
Do I not know how to swim.

13:22.480 --> 13:26.075
'Cause I'm black, huh? So, you think
all black people just scared of water.

13:26.160 --> 13:28.913
I'm so sorry. Of course you can swim.

13:29.400 --> 13:33.029
- Actually, I can't. But, you know...
- Well, I'm getting in.

13:36.840 --> 13:38.398
Swimming, huh?

13:40.160 --> 13:42.071
Well, hell, how hard can it be?

13:46.400 --> 13:48.550
Damn, baby, you smell like
a candy shop or something.

13:48.640 --> 13:51.234
Vanilla Body Spray.
Sparkle Classic swag bag.

13:51.320 --> 13:53.675
Yeah, but you sure you wanna wash off
all that sweetness, baby?

13:53.760 --> 13:55.432
I mean, we could go somewhere
and just stay dry.

13:55.520 --> 13:58.592
Skills, come on. You have to trust me.

13:58.680 --> 14:00.910
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.390
Do you remember when we saw <i>Titanic?</i>
"I'll never let you go."

14:04.480 --> 14:08.712
That's easy for you to say.
'Cause the girl lived, but the dude...

14:09.840 --> 14:13.674
- His ass drowned.
- Come on. Come on.

14:15.160 --> 14:18.675
- This food looks amazing, Mrs. Battle.
- Well, I hope you boys are hungry.

14:18.760 --> 14:21.149
If you're anything like Tony,
that's not gonna be a problem.

14:21.240 --> 14:22.468
Mom!

14:23.160 --> 14:25.515
Nathan. We say grace in this house.

14:26.040 --> 14:28.190
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

14:28.280 --> 14:30.077
Aliyah, would you like to say grace?

14:30.760 --> 14:33.433
Thank you, dear God, for the lasagna.

14:34.480 --> 14:38.359
Thank you, also, for sending Lucas here
and having him sit next to me,

14:38.440 --> 14:40.590
'cause he is really, really fine.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.594
Nice. That was heartfelt. Let's eat.

14:46.040 --> 14:47.155
Best grace ever.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.756
So, Pops, I was just telling these guys

14:50.840 --> 14:53.354
I'm gonna have to light them up
in the Classic tomorrow night.

14:53.440 --> 14:56.477
Well, you know who holds the all-time
record for points at the Classic.

14:56.560 --> 14:59.028
- All right, here we go.
- You played ball, Mr. Battle?

14:59.120 --> 15:02.590
- Son, I lit them up in high school.
- That's cool. What happened?

15:02.680 --> 15:05.831
- Life happened. I had this knucklehead.
- Hey, man.

15:06.240 --> 15:09.710
Was it hard, letting go?
Wondering what might've been?

15:09.800 --> 15:12.837
Not really. At a certain point,
it's not about what might've been,

15:12.920 --> 15:14.273
but what might be.

15:14.560 --> 15:17.836
On the drive out, you see all those
guys hanging out on street corners?

15:17.920 --> 15:20.070
Just them and what might have been.

15:20.160 --> 15:22.628
Honey, do you need me to get you
your soapbox,

15:22.720 --> 15:24.278
or are you doing okay from your seat?

15:25.160 --> 15:27.196
Let's hear about you two.
What's your father do?

15:27.840 --> 15:30.274
Well, he hangs out with
what might have been.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.875
Well, it's a tough thing.

15:32.960 --> 15:35.599
But I bet deep down he wishes the best
for both of you,

15:35.680 --> 15:39.559
a good education and the hope
that you'll find your way.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.950
That's what every father
hopes for his child.

15:42.040 --> 15:44.634
- Not yours.
- Whoa, fall back, little man.

15:44.720 --> 15:47.473
My youngest son is referring
to the father I never knew.

15:47.560 --> 15:50.916
But I bet somewhere out there,
he is thinking the same thing.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.558
That's what fathers do.

15:59.080 --> 16:00.672
You ready to hit the lanes?

16:02.400 --> 16:04.038
I kind of had plans, Whitey.

16:06.560 --> 16:07.879
You disappear for four months,

16:07.960 --> 16:11.475
and then you can't find the time
to take an old man bowling.

16:11.560 --> 16:12.675
I...

16:17.440 --> 16:20.910
- Go ahead. You two have a great time.
- Thanks, Karen.

16:22.120 --> 16:23.838
Carry that, will you?

16:29.000 --> 16:30.672
So he says...

16:31.760 --> 16:33.990
Hey, Travis, have you seen Solaris?
I lost her.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.640
- She's in the VIP room.
- No, I was just in there.

16:36.720 --> 16:40.474
Not that one, the real VIP room. Upstairs.

16:47.560 --> 16:48.629
Solaris?

16:53.880 --> 16:56.235
- Solaris?
- Brooke?

17:00.400 --> 17:01.594
Are you okay?

17:03.600 --> 17:06.876
I just snorted too much H.
I'll be fine in a minute.

17:07.400 --> 17:08.992
As in heroin?

17:12.920 --> 17:16.595
Oh, look, the princess fell off her pony.

17:18.960 --> 17:22.669
- Is she okay?
- She's more than okay, sweetie, trust me.

17:22.760 --> 17:25.479
- You're so pretty.
- Isn't she?

17:27.560 --> 17:29.437
Hey, I'm only 17.

17:29.520 --> 17:31.158
Didn't know you were so old, sweetie.

17:31.880 --> 17:34.633
- I thought you were more Solaris' age.
- That's disgusting.

17:35.400 --> 17:39.029
Watch yourself, little girl.
You're swimming in the deep end now.

17:59.520 --> 18:02.318
I had one like it once that I got
from this vintage store,

18:00.720 --> 18:03.518
but I left it at this guy's house one night.

18:03.600 --> 18:07.434
Loved the jacket, hated the guy.
So I never went back for it.

18:07.280 --> 18:11.512
- It was my birth mother's.
- Yeah, I heard about that.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.349
Sucks.

18:15.880 --> 18:17.154
Yep.

18:17.480 --> 18:20.950
I'm sorry. I'm not so good at
the whole shoulder-to-lean-on thing.

18:23.840 --> 18:25.193
You're in luck. I'm not looking for one.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.834
I am, on the other hand,
looking for another drink.

18:30.160 --> 18:33.277
Works for me. Try this. I call it sympathy.

18:32.680 --> 18:35.240
Right, well, here's to sympathy.

18:35.880 --> 18:37.108
For the devil.

18:40.040 --> 18:43.749
Someone is in trouble.

18:46.760 --> 18:48.512
Why? It's not even past curfew.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.199
Haley.

18:52.640 --> 18:55.837
- You know you're always such trouble.
- Oh, my God, you thought I was Keith.

18:54.720 --> 18:57.712
Okay. Nathan's MIA.
I just thought I'd stop by

18:58.000 --> 19:00.912
for a girl's night in with pay-per-view,
but if you've got big plans...

19:01.080 --> 19:03.674
Of course, of course. Get in here.

19:04.080 --> 19:06.116
- You sure?
- I'd love the company.

19:08.400 --> 19:11.836
- All right, movie guide.
- Yeah.

19:11.720 --> 19:14.757
- Thank you.
- Romance. Adventure. Nothing too scary.

19:15.640 --> 19:18.473
Yeah, I can't really watch
scary movies anyway.

19:19.120 --> 19:21.714
I could totally be down
for John Cusack, <i>Must Love Dogs.</i>

19:22.040 --> 19:25.237
Oh, yeah.
That means you want to watch it, right?

19:24.720 --> 19:26.950
- Yeah.
- Good. I like Diane Lane.

19:28.520 --> 19:30.033
<i>- Press select to start your movie.</i>
- Me, too.

19:30.840 --> 19:32.831
Did you see her in <i>A Walk on the Moon?</i>

19:32.440 --> 19:36.399
<i>Yeah, baby. Love that ass...</i>

19:34.520 --> 19:37.432
<i>"Must Love..."I</i> missed an "N"!
I thought it said "Dogs."

19:38.560 --> 19:41.279
- I'm sorry...
- We can't watch that!

19:41.560 --> 19:43.232
What do you got, Big Time?
I got you, buddy.

19:44.360 --> 19:46.590
Good shot, Big Time.

19:46.120 --> 19:48.350
Wait, now, don't shame me out there, Son.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.516
- T's getting schooled!
- You know!

19:51.800 --> 19:54.553
Man, you see how I have the home court
disadvantage here, man?

19:54.360 --> 19:56.191
My own family, man.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.156
I'm not sure blue's my color, Aliyah.

20:04.560 --> 20:06.915
Trust me. It brings out your eyes.

20:06.600 --> 20:07.999
- Come on, A. J.
- Well, well, well.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.752
Let's school these two! Come on.

20:11.640 --> 20:14.677
- Now we got a game, now we got a game.
- Now we're talking, me and my man.

20:13.320 --> 20:16.835
- All right, me and my man...
- Let's go, boy. Let's go, let's go.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.750
And how is the most beautiful girl
in New York City doing?

20:21.880 --> 20:23.677
Oh, that hurts.

20:24.120 --> 20:25.269
I'm great.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.589
But I miss you so much.

20:28.120 --> 20:29.838
I miss you, too, baby girl.

20:32.280 --> 20:33.633
You must be having
the greatest time, huh?

20:34.280 --> 20:35.998
Yeah, it's crazy.

20:35.720 --> 20:38.280
Listen, I gotta go,
but I can't wait to see you.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.035
I love you, babe.

20:42.560 --> 20:43.709
I love you, too.

20:44.360 --> 20:46.351
Show them your move, baby.
Show them your move.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.233
- I got him.
- What's the matter?

20:50.800 --> 20:53.997
Too low for you to grab the ball?
Got a bad back, old man?

20:52.400 --> 20:54.072
A.J., that's my baby.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.752
When you finish your makeover,
you should take over for me.

21:03.520 --> 21:04.555
I'm headed out, kids.

21:06.600 --> 21:08.477
All right, Pop. Don't work too hard, man.

21:07.720 --> 21:09.153
- Love you, boy.
- Love you, Pop.

21:10.920 --> 21:15.038
- Thanks a lot, Mr. Battle. Appreciate it.
- You got a great family, sir.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.032
- You must be proud.
- I am.

21:18.560 --> 21:19.993
You boys go strong, now.

21:20.720 --> 21:21.994
Come on, sweet pea.

21:22.680 --> 21:25.513
- Battle, man, you have an awesome dad.
- Yeah.

21:26.040 --> 21:27.951
You know, he could have played D1 ball,
but you know,

21:29.320 --> 21:31.072
he just ended up being a dad instead.

21:31.320 --> 21:33.356
- He's not bitter about it at all.
- Nah.

21:33.160 --> 21:35.151
My dad's in love with life, man.

21:35.280 --> 21:37.840
I mean, we're doing good now,
but, hey, when we were little,

21:37.520 --> 21:39.476
man, we came up broke as hell.

21:40.160 --> 21:41.832
- What changed?
- Nothing.

21:42.960 --> 21:44.712
He just kept working the same two jobs.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.280
You know, he was happy then,
he's happy now.

21:46.560 --> 21:48.949
You know, he says regret makes you old

21:49.200 --> 21:51.760
and bitterness poisons
the people around you.

21:51.680 --> 21:53.398
Your father's a smart man.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.436
Excuse me, Mr. Cab Driver,
what's your name?

22:04.760 --> 22:06.318
You can call me Daoud.

22:09.480 --> 22:11.710
Okay, I don't think I can call you Dad.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.312
No. Daoud.

22:14.880 --> 22:16.552
Sorry. Daoud.

22:19.560 --> 22:21.630
Would you mind doing me a favor
and turning on the radio?

22:23.320 --> 22:26.357
I have some
really important decisions to make.

22:25.480 --> 22:26.549
Of course.

22:28.720 --> 22:31.188
Would you tell me
what he's saying, please?

22:37.720 --> 22:40.837
It is a story of a young girl who's very sad.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.391
She is torn between two men.

22:46.080 --> 22:48.355
One man is very rich

22:48.680 --> 22:51.069
and offers to take her away
from her home,

22:51.560 --> 22:53.949
to show her all the wonders of the world.

22:54.280 --> 22:56.077
So why is she torn?

22:57.280 --> 22:58.952
Because the other man,

23:00.240 --> 23:02.754
this man, she has known all her life.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.638
She loves him very much.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.558
Yeah.

23:12.040 --> 23:13.712
See? It's not so bad, is it?

23:20.840 --> 23:22.273
You wanna try it by yourself?

23:22.960 --> 23:25.428
Actually, I'm not ready
for you to let me go just yet.

23:24.480 --> 23:25.515
Okay.

23:27.040 --> 23:28.996
But we can go upstairs
whenever you want.

23:28.320 --> 23:31.232
You know what?
I am kind of tired from all this floating.

23:30.360 --> 23:32.635
Well, just so you know,
there's only one bed.

23:33.360 --> 23:36.591
- I hope you're cool with that.
- It's not a waterbed, is it?

23:35.720 --> 23:36.948
Oh, good.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.830
So A.J. And I roughed you guys up
tonight, huh?

23:43.520 --> 23:47.069
Yeah? Might wanna wipe the eye shadow
off before you start talking smack.

23:45.840 --> 23:47.512
Nah, it's working for me.

23:49.480 --> 23:52.040
I ate the food before saying grace.

23:53.400 --> 23:54.799
How was I supposed to know?

23:56.520 --> 23:57.748
You're kidding, right?

23:58.000 --> 23:59.877
You always say grace before dinner.

23:59.880 --> 24:02.235
I mean, granted, every time I did it
I was sitting at the counter

24:01.840 --> 24:04.070
at my mom's café, and every time it was

24:04.280 --> 24:05.872
"Thank you for the chicken fingers,"
but still.

24:06.960 --> 24:07.995
Yeah.

24:08.640 --> 24:11.279
Well, dinner for me was always a TV tray
and whatever game was on.

24:09.760 --> 24:12.558
Yeah, I guess we can both thank Dan
for those solo dinners, eh?

24:12.480 --> 24:15.438
Well, and then there's Chuck Battle.
Never had a father in his life.

24:15.360 --> 24:17.828
In one generation,
he just changed everything.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.038
You could do the same with Haley.

24:21.920 --> 24:23.273
Look, I'll catch up with you inside.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.438
All right, and do yourself a favor.

24:26.320 --> 24:28.117
Take a bath, dude. You stink.

24:28.080 --> 24:32.437
But I don't understand how you think
you can trust Lucas this time around.

24:31.240 --> 24:35.472
It's a long story that, frankly,
paints me in a really bad light.

24:35.760 --> 24:38.228
Hey, the meter's not still running, right?

24:41.720 --> 24:42.994
I shut it off when we parked.

24:44.320 --> 24:47.392
But feel free to tip generously
for my brilliant advice.

24:45.680 --> 24:48.717
I just don't understand why I'm so sad

24:52.040 --> 24:55.635
when I'm so young
and this great thing is happening for me.

24:55.640 --> 24:58.029
You have a lot of life ahead of you,
you know.

24:59.440 --> 25:02.079
So, what are you saying? Why rush it?

25:01.920 --> 25:03.717
And I can be a fashion designer
when I grow up.

25:06.040 --> 25:07.712
I don't have to be one tomorrow, but...

25:07.920 --> 25:09.797
No, I'm saying the opposite.

25:09.680 --> 25:11.591
Time passes you by, young lady.

25:11.920 --> 25:15.913
You have a long life, and you can start
by making it great right now.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.199
My life would be very different

25:19.200 --> 25:21.873
if I could have the chance
you've been given.

25:20.680 --> 25:23.399
Would you rather drive a cab,
or design clothes?

25:23.440 --> 25:24.793
I see your point.

25:26.560 --> 25:30.235
Thank you so much, Daoud.
And good luck with everything.

25:31.920 --> 25:33.592
Here's triple the fare.

25:38.520 --> 25:41.193
You have a very generous heart,
Brooke Davis.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.310
Hey, what happens with that song?

25:45.840 --> 25:48.479
The one about the girl
torn between two lovers?

25:48.680 --> 25:50.511
There's much happiness, I assure you.

25:52.200 --> 25:53.838
No cheerleading for you?

26:30.360 --> 26:31.588
No, I guess not.

26:35.480 --> 26:39.189
Well, if you do well in this show,
there won't be time for things like that.

26:36.800 --> 26:37.835
You'll be the talk of the town.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.397
It's just hard to let it go.

26:43.480 --> 26:46.631
There are designers here who have been
struggling in the fashion world for years.

26:45.360 --> 26:47.590
And yet, overnight,
this could be the start of your career.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.238
And the end of being a kid, right?

26:50.920 --> 26:53.275
Being a kid ends for all of us, Brooke,
trust me.

26:53.280 --> 26:55.874
Having an apprenticeship
with Donna Karan and your own label

26:55.720 --> 26:56.789
makes things easier.

26:58.400 --> 26:59.435
Good luck.

27:01.680 --> 27:03.272
Yeah, very funny, Lucas.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.751
Your ass is still sleeping on the floor.

27:15.600 --> 27:16.589
Surprise!

27:22.200 --> 27:25.988
I switched rooms with Lucas.
I don't have to sleep on the floor, do I?

27:24.560 --> 27:26.039
How'd you manage to switch rooms?

27:28.600 --> 27:29.828
Well, believe it or not,

27:30.160 --> 27:32.913
Bevin "Mastermind" Mirsky
arranged the whole thing.

27:31.480 --> 27:32.469
Oh, yeah?

27:34.320 --> 27:35.833
Any room in there for me?

27:38.360 --> 27:40.351
I thought you'd never ask.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.148
Nathan!

27:44.960 --> 27:46.188
Come here.

27:50.440 --> 27:52.556
<i>And the stars are</i>

28:00.720 --> 28:01.709
What are they doing?

28:02.920 --> 28:04.069
<i>They're crying...</i>

28:04.000 --> 28:04.989
Come on!

28:05.240 --> 28:08.596
<i>For what we could have had</i>

28:06.320 --> 28:08.595
- Okay, okay...
- No, I like that line.

28:09.760 --> 28:13.116
It reminds me of Luke...
I mean, Jake. Jake.

28:12.120 --> 28:14.156
Are you sure you don't mean Lucas?

28:15.560 --> 28:17.790
No, it's Jake.

28:17.680 --> 28:19.352
Well, whatever you say.

28:20.680 --> 28:22.636
Okay, well, look, I have to go to sleep now.

28:22.920 --> 28:26.356
Okay, but... Thank you.
Thank you for hanging out with me.

28:24.960 --> 28:26.871
You know, you're not
the manipulative psycho

28:28.680 --> 28:30.398
I thought you were.

28:30.680 --> 28:32.511
Well, enjoy.

28:32.680 --> 28:33.669
Good night.

28:35.080 --> 28:36.274
Are you drunk?

28:59.320 --> 29:01.151
Are you wearing eye shadow?

29:02.280 --> 29:03.679
Working through the pain?

29:07.160 --> 29:08.195
Kind of.

29:10.200 --> 29:12.509
Everything's gonna be all right, right?

29:14.120 --> 29:15.155
Yeah.

29:19.760 --> 29:21.079
Yeah, it is.

29:22.520 --> 29:24.192
Oh, God.

29:38.120 --> 29:39.951
How drunk was I last night?

29:41.320 --> 29:43.675
Drunk enough to puke six times.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.879
Let me guess. Rachel?

29:46.680 --> 29:47.954
Yeah.

29:49.680 --> 29:53.434
Rachel's probably not the best person
to use the buddy system with.

29:51.360 --> 29:53.999
I feel like you're always rescuing me.

29:55.800 --> 29:58.872
Also, like there's a giant elephant
standing on my head.

29:58.800 --> 30:02.952
Yeah, well, I can't rescue you from
the routine you have to do in three hours.

30:02.040 --> 30:04.031
I'll wake you up in a half hour.

30:08.280 --> 30:10.840
God, this bed is so comfortable.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.236
Wow, that was attractive.

30:18.120 --> 30:19.473
Room service?

30:21.040 --> 30:25.272
Actually, let's have a proper
sit-down breakfast somewhere,

30:22.720 --> 30:23.914
family-style.

30:27.440 --> 30:30.238
Family-style sounds perfect.

30:29.880 --> 30:32.474
If it's the maid service,
we're good, thanks.

30:39.040 --> 30:40.268
Brooke!

30:54.880 --> 30:57.110
I cannot believe I flew all the way back
from New York for this.

30:56.280 --> 30:58.032
I'm the dumbest girl alive.

30:58.600 --> 31:01.433
Brooke, don't freak out. Okay, look.

31:00.680 --> 31:03.672
Peyton was drunk,
she crashed in my room by accident.

31:03.880 --> 31:05.279
It wasn't her fault.

31:06.960 --> 31:10.430
The rooms got switched.
She didn't get the message, okay?

31:08.440 --> 31:09.953
I slept on the floor.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.072
By the way, thrilled to see you.

31:13.880 --> 31:17.111
Hey, come on, what did we say
about trusting each other?

31:18.320 --> 31:20.788
You know Peyton needs
both of us right now.

31:24.600 --> 31:26.033
I missed you.

31:34.040 --> 31:35.234
I missed you.

31:38.280 --> 31:41.397
Well, well.
Looks like somebody had a rough night.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.350
Says the girl who poured drinks
down my throat

31:48.320 --> 31:51.357
and then dropped me off
in my best friend's boyfriend's bed.

31:50.640 --> 31:52.631
Look, I just led you
to the door, sweetheart.

31:53.760 --> 31:55.876
We're not giant pandas, you know?

31:55.840 --> 31:58.513
You can't just put us together
and expect us to mate.

31:58.120 --> 32:02.432
And do me a favor, talk soft.
You've got a terrible voice.

32:00.880 --> 32:05.271
Look, I was trying to help you out.
I'm sorry if it's not what you wanted.

32:05.720 --> 32:07.278
You know what? You can't see it,

32:10.240 --> 32:13.357
but underneath my sunglasses,
I'm rolling my eyes.

32:11.880 --> 32:14.519
- Speak of the devil.
- Look, don't take that.

32:18.480 --> 32:21.358
We have to get ready.
Brooke is not a part of this.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.509
You are so happy you're not me right now.

32:24.840 --> 32:26.512
<i>You sound level 10 hung-over.</i>

32:27.240 --> 32:29.196
Yeah, well, you should see me.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.070
Yeah, you look like ass, too.

32:31.560 --> 32:33.198
Brooke, what the heck!

32:34.160 --> 32:37.470
- Hey!
- What about the fashion show?

32:35.880 --> 32:37.871
I have the rest of my life for that stuff.

32:40.440 --> 32:42.715
Not so much to be 17 with my friends.

32:42.520 --> 32:43.635
How sweet.

32:44.880 --> 32:48.714
Unfortunately, my routine
only needs nine girls, not 10.

32:46.640 --> 32:49.313
Which means you're gonna have
to sit this one out, Captain.

32:51.200 --> 32:53.760
- Well, I think we can manage, right, girls?
- Yes!

32:53.960 --> 32:54.995
Yeah.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.477
And watch me for the changes.

32:59.080 --> 33:00.991
Come on, girls, let's stretch.

33:01.360 --> 33:03.828
- You okay?
- You can't be out here with me.

33:39.840 --> 33:43.150
No, it's okay. I talked to Brooke.
She knows what happened.

33:42.400 --> 33:43.719
It's not okay.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.709
I mean, it is, but it's hard on Brooke.
So just...

33:47.760 --> 33:49.239
I'll be fine.

33:52.200 --> 33:53.758
You know...

33:56.400 --> 33:58.311
Peyton, you can learn a lot from Ellie.

33:59.240 --> 34:02.357
She struck me as tough.

34:01.240 --> 34:02.389
Yeah.

34:04.640 --> 34:06.870
And that's important. But...

34:05.880 --> 34:08.757
I also think you can learn a lot
from her mistakes.

34:10.080 --> 34:12.913
Don't live your life alone.

34:13.360 --> 34:14.554
Let us in.

34:18.080 --> 34:21.868
<i>And how about a warm welcome</i>
<i>for the Palmetto Panthers?</i>

34:38.520 --> 34:41.159
You know, I'm still trying to figure out
which was more fun last night,

34:46.280 --> 34:50.592
sleeping on the floor, or Whitey
snoring the theme song to <i>M.A.S.H.</i>

34:49.000 --> 34:50.034
Top that.

34:54.159 --> 34:56.514
Well, let's see, I took a bath,

34:55.920 --> 34:59.037
I hung out with Haley
and watched an adult movie.

34:59.480 --> 35:01.436
Haley is a bad influence.

35:06.160 --> 35:08.276
Most of all, I missed you.

35:09.240 --> 35:11.071
Okay, Peyton, focus.

35:21.600 --> 35:24.433
Brooke, try to keep up.
Bevin, don't be an idiot.

35:23.720 --> 35:25.995
We're winning that trophy.
All right, let's go.

35:26.720 --> 35:29.393
One last thing, girls, have fun.

35:29.080 --> 35:32.117
<i>And next up,</i>
<i>in this year's Secret Sparkle Classic,</i>

35:32.200 --> 35:34.316
<i>when you're strong, you sparkle,</i>

35:35.640 --> 35:38.279
<i>the Tree Hill Ravens cheerleaders!</i>

35:37.840 --> 35:39.478
What are you doing here?

36:05.760 --> 36:07.796
And what the hell do you
smell like dessert for?

36:08.040 --> 36:09.393
Vanilla Body Spray.

36:10.160 --> 36:12.276
Plus, Bevin teaching me how to swim.

36:12.040 --> 36:15.874
- Skills, you're the best swimmer I know.
- Right. I swim-lessoned her, dawg.

36:15.360 --> 36:17.555
Had to get her back for notebooking me.
You know?

36:19.280 --> 36:20.315
Pick it up, Peyton.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.753
I can't help it.
Someone got me drunk last night.

36:23.120 --> 36:24.519
Go, Bevin!

36:27.320 --> 36:28.753
I'm sorry.

36:40.680 --> 36:42.272
Go, Ravens!

37:20.080 --> 37:21.069
Come on.

37:21.920 --> 37:23.831
Solaris, you're wearing
two different shoes, you moron!

38:00.200 --> 38:01.553
You might want to lay off the drugs,

38:02.200 --> 38:04.191
considering you don't have that many
brain cells to begin with.

38:03.640 --> 38:04.675
It doesn't matter anyway.

38:05.720 --> 38:07.631
Brooke Davis checked out this morning.

38:06.840 --> 38:09.434
Can you believe she walked away
from all this?

38:08.840 --> 38:11.035
You know, if the rest of my days
are like this,

38:17.520 --> 38:19.590
I'm gonna die a happy man.

38:19.800 --> 38:21.119
Marry me.

38:25.040 --> 38:26.917
You can't propose to me.

38:27.160 --> 38:29.037
I was gonna propose to you...

38:29.120 --> 38:33.352
I'm telling you
I did not order any pornography.

38:38.160 --> 38:40.435
<i>Most of our life is a series of images.</i>

38:44.800 --> 38:47.394
<i>They pass us by</i>
<i>like towns on the highway.</i>

38:47.960 --> 38:50.793
<i>But sometimes a moment stuns us</i>
<i>as it happens,</i>

38:50.840 --> 38:54.037
<i>and we know that this instant</i>
<i>is more than a fleeting image.</i>

38:54.240 --> 38:56.196
<i>We know that this moment,</i>

38:57.520 --> 39:00.830
<i>every part of it, will live on forever.</i>
