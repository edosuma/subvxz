00:05.138 --> 00:09.141
<i>Do you teach people</i>
<i>how to kill?</i>

00:10.610 --> 00:12.611
<i>Is your father command?!</i>

00:14.214 --> 00:16.482
<i>Hi...</i>
<i>Oh! (gasps)</i>

00:16.484 --> 00:19.118
(cell phone rings)

00:20.253 --> 00:22.087
(beep)
(lowered voice) I can't talk.

00:22.089 --> 00:25.357
Liv, we need to talk about jake
and how he got there.

00:25.359 --> 00:26.658
I have to go.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.193
(cell phone beeps)

00:32.065 --> 00:35.167
(buttons click, line rings)

00:35.169 --> 00:37.770
Where are you?
What do you want?

00:37.772 --> 00:39.772
To talk. We need to talk.

00:39.774 --> 00:40.806
No, we don't.

00:40.808 --> 00:42.041
Huck...

00:42.043 --> 00:44.109
I'm fine.
I just need some time.

00:46.079 --> 00:47.046
Okay.

00:47.048 --> 00:48.147
Good-bye.

00:51.418 --> 00:53.252
(projector and camera shutter
click)

01:10.603 --> 01:13.839
(projector and camera shutter
click)

01:18.178 --> 01:19.545
Oh, here she is now.

01:19.547 --> 01:23.348
Thank you so much
for agreeing to help me.

01:23.350 --> 01:25.484
Help you with what,
exactly?

01:25.486 --> 01:27.086
Mary wants to retain
pope and associates

01:27.088 --> 01:28.520
To manage
a private family matter.

01:28.522 --> 01:30.189
I-I wish I had time
to go into it right now,

01:30.191 --> 01:33.859
But I'm actually running off
to a meeting on the hill.

01:33.861 --> 01:35.561
But we'll speak soon,
I promise.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.797
Okay--
new client.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.834
25k retainer.
Enough to pay the rent.
Yee-haw.

01:41.836 --> 01:44.803
Have you heard from huck?
I texted. I called.

01:44.805 --> 01:47.673
Huck is taking
a personal day.

01:47.675 --> 01:49.441
Personal day?
A personal day.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.810
We... Get personal days?

01:51.812 --> 01:53.679
What, do we get
vacation now, too?

01:55.348 --> 01:56.682
(projector and camera shutter
click)

01:56.684 --> 01:58.484
The poll numbers
are good.

01:58.486 --> 02:02.554
Okay, not good. Decent.
No, not decent. Bad.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.156
They're bad,
but not a disaster.

02:04.158 --> 02:06.225
Fitz having an affair
isn't new information

02:06.227 --> 02:09.228
For the american people.
Mellie, you made sure of that.

02:09.230 --> 02:11.230
Thank you, actually.
He can feed himself.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.599
He will get dirty.
What the american people
are interested in,

02:13.601 --> 02:15.367
What they're excited about
is the two of you together.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.703
(baby voice) babies get dirty,
don't they? So what?

02:17.705 --> 02:22.174
How you're weathering the storm.
You wanna change
his clothes?

02:22.176 --> 02:27.412
How much you love one another.
Marta knows he can feed himself.
Where is marta?

02:27.414 --> 02:29.681
Why are you even--
because cyrus scheduled
a thousand

02:29.683 --> 02:32.184
"isn't she a good mother?"
photo ops for me and teddy,

02:32.186 --> 02:33.785
And I would like it
if when he screamed "mama"

02:33.787 --> 02:35.787
When the cameras flashed,
he didn't mean marta.

02:35.789 --> 02:38.290
Yes, I have scheduled
some great photo ops.

02:38.292 --> 02:41.260
There's mellie and teddy,
fitz and mellie, teddy and fitz.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.694
I'm thinking of flying in
jerry and karen.

02:42.696 --> 02:43.896
You're stunting
his development.

02:43.898 --> 02:45.264
Don't tell me
what to do with the son

02:45.266 --> 02:46.932
You could barely get it up
to conceive.

02:46.934 --> 02:50.235
<i>O-o-or</i> jerry and karen
can meet you

02:50.237 --> 02:51.904
When you arrive
at camp david.

02:51.906 --> 02:54.273
Camp david?
Excuse me?

02:54.275 --> 02:56.942
Camp <i>david,</i> where...

02:56.944 --> 03:00.946
You are going to talk
and share and bond and heal

03:00.948 --> 03:02.514
To show the american people
how committed you are

03:02.516 --> 03:05.851
As a family...
(baby voice) to baby teddy.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.619
I am not going to be trapped
at camp david with that man.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.321
You think I wanna be there
with you?
You're going.

03:09.323 --> 03:12.858
She's right. I'm not getting
stuck out there with her.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.259
I'm not going.
You <i>are</i> going!

03:14.261 --> 03:15.794
Everybody is going,

03:15.796 --> 03:17.229
And it will be beautiful

03:17.231 --> 03:18.597
From the moment
the cameras film you

03:18.599 --> 03:20.832
Walking across
the white house lawn

03:20.834 --> 03:25.237
All through your weekend of love
at camp david.

03:25.239 --> 03:26.772
You'll hold hands.
You'll smile.

03:26.774 --> 03:28.907
You will be photographed
from every single angle,

03:28.909 --> 03:31.243
And the optics
will be spectacular.

03:31.245 --> 03:33.879
You will show
the american people

03:33.881 --> 03:37.216
That your love is <i>real</i>
<i>and</i> <i>special!</i>
<i>(pounds table)</i>

03:37.218 --> 03:41.286
You <i>will</i> make the magic
happen!
(teddy fusses)

03:43.323 --> 03:46.258
Are you happy now?
He's filthy.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.694
<i>Shut... Up.</i>

03:48.696 --> 03:50.362
<i>You</i> shut up.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.531
This is interesting.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.966
(closes door)
so I'm entering the check
into the books--

03:53.968 --> 03:56.001
The new client check?
Don't tell me it bounced.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.703
The check bounced?
No, no, no. Listen.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.538
Does the name chris lawrence
ring a bell?

03:59.540 --> 04:03.442
No. Why?
He's mary's son. He was killed
in a fbi raid 15 months ago.

04:03.444 --> 04:04.876
What'd they want him for?

04:04.878 --> 04:06.411
The apartment was home base
to an alleged terror cell.

04:06.413 --> 04:09.948
Also, the check
is for 27,870 bucks.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.718
That's specific.
I thought so, too, so I hacked
into her bank account--

04:12.720 --> 04:17.723
In her checking account
two days ago.
She cleaned out
her bank account?

04:17.725 --> 04:19.258
Where did she say
she was going?

04:19.260 --> 04:22.027
To a meeting.
On the hill.

04:28.635 --> 04:30.535
If you stood in this spot
40 years ago,

04:30.537 --> 04:33.605
Swimming in the deep end
of an indoor pool

04:33.607 --> 04:35.707
Built for f.D.R.
And used daily and nightly

04:35.709 --> 04:37.276
By president kennedy.

04:37.278 --> 04:38.677
If you'll follow me this way,

04:38.679 --> 04:40.579
We'll head
towards the north portico.

04:40.581 --> 04:42.781
(projector and camera shutter
click)

04:42.783 --> 04:43.915
(door closes)

04:45.852 --> 04:47.452
Sir?

04:47.454 --> 04:49.688
Intruder! Band box!

04:49.690 --> 04:52.391
Headed towards the oval!
All agents respond!

04:56.562 --> 04:59.398
(lowered voice) hurry! Hurry!
Go, go, go, go!

05:06.339 --> 05:07.839
(telephone rings)

05:07.841 --> 05:10.942
(projector and camera shutter
click)

05:10.944 --> 05:13.545
(ringing continues)

05:13.547 --> 05:15.080
(second telephone ringing)

05:15.082 --> 05:16.348
(woman screams)

05:16.350 --> 05:17.582
Sir!
Move out of the way!

05:17.584 --> 05:19.951
Aah! (grunts)

05:19.953 --> 05:22.954
I need to talk to the president
about operation remington!

05:22.956 --> 05:24.589
Intruder contained!
Evacuate the complex.

05:24.591 --> 05:25.924
I need to talk
to the president!

05:25.926 --> 05:28.360
(man) please, ma'am,
if you'd just calm down--

05:28.362 --> 05:30.595
So you could have
prevented this. You could have--

05:30.597 --> 05:31.697
Mary?

05:31.699 --> 05:34.766
Ms. Pope?

05:35.868 --> 05:38.937
(gasps)
what are you doing here?

05:38.939 --> 05:41.973
(projector and camera shutter
click)

05:48.515 --> 05:53.885
<i>The threat level</i>
<i>has been raised to elevated.</i>

05:53.887 --> 05:56.688
<i>Meanwhile, all air traffic</i>
<i>in and out of washington</i>

05:56.690 --> 05:58.757
<i>Has been halted,</i>
<i>as homeland security</i>

05:58.759 --> 06:00.926
<i>Continues to examine</i>
<i>the scope of the threat.</i>

06:00.928 --> 06:02.661
One intruder?
All this for one person?

06:02.663 --> 06:04.696
There's also a woman
with a bomb at the capitol.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.932
We have to make sure
it's not a coordinated attack.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.600
I need to get
to the sit room.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.535
I can't allow that, sir.
Good luck stopping me.

06:10.537 --> 06:11.837
I'm afraid that under these
current threat protocols,

06:11.839 --> 06:14.639
I'd be forced
to tackle you, sir.

06:14.641 --> 06:15.741
Tackle me?

06:15.743 --> 06:18.377
There goes our romantic getaway.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.849
(siren wailing)

06:32.125 --> 06:34.025
I didn't wanna have
to do this.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.727
I know. Just listen to my voice,
mary.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.896
Listen to me.
No!

06:37.898 --> 06:40.766
No! You--
no, you listen to me.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.467
Both of you
are gonna listen to me!

06:42.469 --> 06:44.636
(voice breaking)
do you know how hard it's been

06:44.638 --> 06:46.772
To get anyone to listen to me?!

06:46.774 --> 06:49.708
I wrote letters.
I-I-I made phone calls

06:49.710 --> 06:51.109
To everyone I could think of.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.545
I-I posted on message boards
and web sites,

06:53.547 --> 06:56.081
And I made fliers
and I tried to get on tv,

06:56.083 --> 06:59.484
And I asked and asked,
but no one would listen to me!

06:59.486 --> 07:04.790
And now there'll be tv cameras
and newspaper articles,

07:04.792 --> 07:07.192
And someone somehow is gonna
give me an answer,

07:07.194 --> 07:10.629
Because my son was killed,
and I wanna know why!

07:10.631 --> 07:13.765
I voted for you!

07:13.767 --> 07:15.634
Do you have any idea
how many times I begged you

07:15.636 --> 07:17.636
To look into chris' murder?

07:17.638 --> 07:19.438
(helicopter whirs in distance)
no. Everyone just cares too much

07:19.440 --> 07:21.640
About senators fooling around
with their interns

07:21.642 --> 07:23.442
And those two boys
who blew up boston,

07:23.444 --> 07:24.910
And no one cares about chris!

07:24.912 --> 07:28.613
But you care now, don't ya?

07:28.615 --> 07:30.182
Now that it's your life
on the line.

07:30.184 --> 07:32.684
I made an inquiry
on your behalf, ma'am.

07:32.686 --> 07:36.087
The fbi shot chris
because he was guilty.

07:36.089 --> 07:38.790
That is not true,
and no one is listening to me!

07:38.792 --> 07:39.958
I'm here.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.526
Okay?

07:41.528 --> 07:45.697
I'm here.
I'm listening.

07:45.699 --> 07:46.932
Tell me what happened
to your son.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.700
Chris lawrence, 25, gunned down

07:48.702 --> 07:50.035
In an fbi raid of an apartment

07:50.037 --> 07:51.970
In the south side of chicago
a year and a half ago.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.605
Big local news story.
Was he guilty?

07:53.607 --> 07:55.106
Investigation was sealed
under the patriot act.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.608
Fbi file is classified.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.043
Whatever happened,
they've kept a tight lid on it.

07:58.045 --> 08:00.412
Backing up, friends say
his dad died when he was 16.

08:00.414 --> 08:02.013
He turned to religion,
joined a local mosque,

08:02.015 --> 08:08.153
They killed him--the fbi,
and they say he was a terrorist,

08:08.155 --> 08:09.654
But they won't say why
they thought that.

08:09.656 --> 08:12.257
It's all classified.
They won't tell me anything!

08:12.259 --> 08:15.060
They won't tell me the truth,
and I... Okay.

08:15.062 --> 08:18.697
I-I-I read something
about you once, ms. Pope--

08:18.699 --> 08:22.567
A profile in a Sunday "post"
or... I don't know.

08:22.569 --> 08:25.170
It said the secret
to your success

08:25.172 --> 08:28.039
Was that you always
trust your gut.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.842
That's why I came
to see you today.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.245
Because my gut says
that chris was innocent.

08:33.247 --> 08:35.981
My gut says the government
murdered an innocent man.

08:35.983 --> 08:38.550
And I think if you
start looking into this,

08:38.552 --> 08:41.052
Yours will tell you
the same thing.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.622
(telephone rings)

08:43.624 --> 08:45.724
(ring)

08:45.726 --> 08:48.226
(continues ringing)

08:48.228 --> 08:49.594
You take one more step,

08:49.596 --> 08:51.162
And I blow us all
to kingdom come.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.064
(ring)

08:53.066 --> 08:55.567
(ring)

08:55.569 --> 08:56.968
(helicopter whirring,
men shouting indistinctly)

08:56.970 --> 08:58.603
This is
commander randolph boles, fbi.

08:58.605 --> 08:59.971
Who am I talking to?

08:59.973 --> 09:01.072
Olivia pope.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.841
Is anyone inside hurt, olivia?

09:02.843 --> 09:06.711
No. Everyone is safe.
There are nine of us here--

09:06.713 --> 09:08.713
Congressman struthers,
six of his staff,

09:08.715 --> 09:12.284
Mary is asking that I be
the one you talk with.

09:12.286 --> 09:13.852
What does mary want,
olivia?

09:13.854 --> 09:16.788
She wants her son's file
declassified.

09:16.790 --> 09:20.759
Tell me what'll happen
if I don't get it.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.995
Sir...

09:23.997 --> 09:26.131
Mary says she has
every intention

09:26.133 --> 09:28.800
Of using the bomb
if she doesn't get the file.

09:28.802 --> 09:29.801
Hang up now.

09:29.803 --> 09:32.837
That these things take time--
I said hang up!

09:32.839 --> 09:34.005
(hangs up telephone)

09:38.778 --> 09:42.681
Sir, we've determined that
the white house intruder

09:42.683 --> 09:44.182
Was a lone wolf,

09:44.184 --> 09:45.717
Unrelated to the woman
in the capitol.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.185
Here's our report.
Mm-hmm.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.621
We are transferring him
to fbi custody,

09:49.623 --> 09:50.822
And I will keep you apprised
as to--

09:50.824 --> 09:53.692
No. Let him go.

09:53.694 --> 09:57.162
Sir, the man tried
to enter the oval office.

09:57.164 --> 09:58.930
Let him go.
Yes, sir.

10:08.174 --> 10:10.809
(cell phone rings)

10:10.811 --> 10:13.144
(ring)

10:13.146 --> 10:14.646
What is it?

10:14.648 --> 10:16.114
We have a remington problem.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.755
Liv, are you--
(olivia) I'm fine.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.156
Harrison, go to
the fbi mobile command center.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.258
Be my eyes and ears. Abby,
work your contacts at justice.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.027
Find out why they've refused
to give mary any details

10:29.029 --> 10:31.296
On her son's death. Quinn,
see if you can save us all time

10:31.298 --> 10:34.966
By hacking into the fbi
to get the file.
(telephone ringing)

10:34.968 --> 10:37.235
Shouldn't huck be the one
to do that--
can you give it a shot, quinn?

10:37.237 --> 10:40.138
Absolutely.
(ring)

10:40.140 --> 10:41.272
(ring)

10:41.274 --> 10:42.674
This is olivia.

10:42.676 --> 10:43.842
How you doing up there?

10:43.844 --> 10:47.145
(exhales) we're fine.

10:47.147 --> 10:50.248
Headquarters is close
to declassifying it,

10:50.250 --> 10:53.151
That if she wants to read
what's inside,

10:53.153 --> 10:55.053
She's gonna have to
turn herself in.

10:56.689 --> 10:58.256
He said they'll give you
the file

10:58.258 --> 11:03.228
He'll be scraping nine bodies
out of the carpeting first.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.063
She says no deal.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.165
I'm afraid that's the best
we can offer.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.900
What is it?

11:11.737 --> 11:13.705
He wants you
to release everyone.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.206
No, that's not at all
what I said.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.841
Does he think I'm an idiot?

11:16.843 --> 11:18.143
(clicks button)
I'm sure he doesn't.

11:18.145 --> 11:20.445
But there's no file
unless you make some

11:20.447 --> 11:21.746
Sort of show
of good faith, mary.

11:21.748 --> 11:24.082
That's how this works.

11:24.084 --> 11:27.886
What do <i>you</i> think?

11:27.888 --> 11:30.822
I count six hostages.
They seem unharmed.

11:30.824 --> 11:34.292
Unclear at this time
how many more might be inside.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.860
All clear.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.395
(door opens)

11:38.898 --> 11:40.265
(man) mr. President.

11:40.267 --> 11:41.266
What's the latest?

11:41.268 --> 11:42.400
She just let
six hostages go.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.135
What does she want
for the rest?

11:44.137 --> 11:49.140
There's something you need
to know about chris lawrence.

11:51.977 --> 11:54.179
It was a mistake. We shouldn't
have released them.

11:54.181 --> 11:56.247
They were scared, mary,
and they weren't a part of this.

11:56.249 --> 11:57.749
It was the right thing
to do.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.184
Why aren't they
giving us the file?

11:59.186 --> 12:01.252
I'm a member of congress,
and it can take me days,

12:01.254 --> 12:02.921
If not weeks,
to get a file that I ask for.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.989
You're making way more progress
than I usually do,

12:04.991 --> 12:07.292
That's for sure.

12:12.098 --> 12:14.199
I had to buy an industrial
glue gun, you know?

12:14.201 --> 12:16.301
I'm sorry?
All I had

12:16.303 --> 12:18.770
Was a little one, you know,
for crafting.

12:18.772 --> 12:22.273
For a project like this,
I need a stronger glue.

12:22.275 --> 12:23.975
I just used my regular
sewing machine, though.

12:23.977 --> 12:27.145
And I added more pockets.
It was simple.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.447
I could've made it back when
I was a kid in home ec.

12:29.449 --> 12:33.184
The glue gun
I had to order special.

12:33.186 --> 12:36.454
How did you get
the explosives?

12:38.124 --> 12:42.360
That was a recipe
I got off the internet.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.229
Make sure they get back--

12:44.231 --> 12:48.266
Commander boles,
the president just joined us.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.235
(boles) we have a half a dozen
snipers in place, sir.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.203
If we get a clean shot,
we'd like to take it--

12:52.205 --> 12:54.272
On your order, sir.
Say we shoot her--

12:54.274 --> 12:57.242
What are the chances
that bomb goes off?

12:57.244 --> 12:59.177
This type of bomb,
if her hand's off the detonator,

12:59.179 --> 13:00.745
We like our odds, sir.

13:01.981 --> 13:03.848
Do it.

13:03.850 --> 13:06.251
That's a go, commander.
Prep your team to go in.

13:06.253 --> 13:07.819
(radio chatter)

13:07.821 --> 13:10.255
They're gearing up
for something, liv.

13:10.257 --> 13:11.923
Does it look like
they're bringing in the file?

13:11.925 --> 13:14.259
Unless the file looks like
a sniper rifle, no.

13:21.367 --> 13:23.168
(rapid footsteps approaching)

13:23.170 --> 13:25.203
I hear movement.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.205
I-I don't like this.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.873
Mary, stay calm.

13:28.875 --> 13:30.375
Sierra 3 here.
I've got eyes

13:30.377 --> 13:32.143
On a target
in the northeast window.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.978
Sierra 3's got a target.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.580
Permission to engage.
Who's the target?

13:35.582 --> 13:37.215
P.O.T.U.S. Wants
a visual I.D.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.317
They're trying something.
They're testing me.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.020
Harrison, talk to me.
What's going on?

13:42.022 --> 13:43.421
(man over walkie-talkie)
potus wants an id

13:43.423 --> 13:45.089
Before any shots are fired.
Hey!

13:45.091 --> 13:47.192
You! Get outta here.
It's the president.

13:47.194 --> 13:49.194
He's running point on this,
liv.
What?!

13:50.830 --> 13:52.263
(button clicks)

13:52.265 --> 13:54.566
Commander boles, what the hell
is going on out there?

13:54.568 --> 13:56.935
Then they get
what's coming to them.

13:56.937 --> 14:01.339
Commander, if you shoot,
make a move, we all die.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.607
Stay calm.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.242
Everything will be fine.
Good-bye, olivia.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.544
Mary! Move!
(cell phone clatters)

14:06.546 --> 14:08.179
What?
Get away from the window now!

14:08.181 --> 14:09.948
What the hell are you doing?!

14:09.950 --> 14:12.383
(blinds whir)
(breathing heavily)

14:14.286 --> 14:16.387
Stand down. Nobody shoot.

14:18.224 --> 14:19.858
(projector and camera shutter
click)

14:23.462 --> 14:26.631
Give me a line into that room,
now.

14:26.633 --> 14:29.534
(lowered voice) you are not
speaking with olivia.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.202
(door closes)
she could have been killed,
cyrus.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.605
Which was stupid and careless,
and we will all now do

14:33.607 --> 14:35.607
Our level best
to not blow her up,

14:35.609 --> 14:38.910
But you cannot call olivia,
because there is no way in hell

14:38.912 --> 14:41.045
I am allowing the two of you
to share a headline

14:41.047 --> 14:43.047
For the third week running.

14:45.484 --> 14:48.052
Not a move.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.254
And I mean no one lifts
so much as a finger

14:49.256 --> 14:50.922
Without a go ahead from me.

14:50.924 --> 14:52.590
Understood, mr. President.

14:52.592 --> 14:55.159
What--what was that?

14:55.161 --> 14:56.928
They had a shot--
a clean shot.

14:56.930 --> 14:59.097
What the heck was that?!
Why didn't you let them
take the shot?

14:59.099 --> 15:03.902
And hit her in the chest,
we end up dead, congressman.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.270
They were trying to rush
this thing.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.071
I was buying us some time.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.973
(telephone rings)

15:08.975 --> 15:11.342
(ring)

15:11.344 --> 15:13.511
Commander boles.
Ms. Pope.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.113
We're still waiting
on that classified file.

15:15.115 --> 15:16.447
The rules have changed.

15:16.449 --> 15:19.217
You're gonna have to let
the congressman go.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.286
I can't do that.
You can't, or you won't?

15:21.288 --> 15:22.954
Because from where
I'm sitting,

15:22.956 --> 15:26.524
No matter what the broad
in the suicide vest thinks.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.927
And if it wasn't for you,
this would've been over by now.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.361
And what the hell
was that stunt you pulled?

15:30.363 --> 15:32.563
Put me through
to the president, commander.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.065
The president?

15:34.067 --> 15:35.533
The president isn't gonna talk
to you, ms. Pope.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.435
You know why?
Because the president

15:37.437 --> 15:39.304
Doesn't negotiate
with terrorists,

15:39.306 --> 15:41.339
And that's what you are--
a terrorist.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.707
You better think about that

15:42.709 --> 15:45.176
When you start asking
the government for favors.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.478
(hangs up telephone)

15:50.015 --> 15:52.150
I need to make
one more call.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.085
(sighs)

15:54.087 --> 15:57.388
And she detonates as soon
as she starts to feel woozy,

15:57.390 --> 15:58.723
Or get woozy
and detonates accidentally.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.191
We could jam their phones.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.960
You have a call, sir.
Not now.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.995
Sir...
You have a call.

16:03.997 --> 16:06.397
Excuse me a moment.

16:16.608 --> 16:18.676
(lowered voice) olivia?
No, mr. President.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.511
Jake?
She wants to know what's in
the classified file

16:20.513 --> 16:22.013
On chris lawrence.

16:22.015 --> 16:23.348
I know she does.

16:23.350 --> 16:26.651
She's not gonna stop
until she gets the truth.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.419
Well, that's a problem, jake,

16:28.421 --> 16:31.022
Because whatever you or I might
feel for olivia personally,

16:31.024 --> 16:32.423
The United States
will not negotiate

16:32.425 --> 16:33.758
With someone who walks
into the capitol building

16:33.760 --> 16:35.159
Wearing a bomb,

16:35.161 --> 16:39.063
No matter
who's representing her.

16:39.065 --> 16:42.133
But you'll have to tell her
you couldn't save the day.

16:46.071 --> 16:49.140
(birds chirping)

16:56.148 --> 16:57.548
(click)

17:00.386 --> 17:02.186
I don't get many visitors
out this way.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.555
Shocking, I know. Drink?

17:04.557 --> 17:05.656
Business hours.

17:05.658 --> 17:09.527
Long commute to the city,
but the views are underrated.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.030
I wanted to deliver this
personally.

17:13.766 --> 17:16.200
(package rustles)

17:16.202 --> 17:18.102
I think you'll find it
a generous increase.

17:18.104 --> 17:19.804
Hmm. I got last month's
lying around here, too,

17:19.806 --> 17:22.073
If you wanna take that
with you.
(package thuds)

17:22.075 --> 17:24.742
Take it, leave it,
burn it,

17:24.744 --> 17:26.577
Should that be
your heart's desire,

17:26.579 --> 17:28.079
But we had a deal,

17:28.081 --> 17:29.247
And your antics at
the white house this morning--

17:29.249 --> 17:30.348
Not part of it.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.183
Hmm? The deal?

17:32.185 --> 17:34.819
Hmm.
I'll tell you what.
Screw the deal.

17:34.821 --> 17:37.055
I'm tired
of turning on the tv

17:37.057 --> 17:39.257
To hear about who
our president's bangin',

17:39.259 --> 17:41.759
Which girl's apartment
he's stumbling out of,

17:41.761 --> 17:43.127
'cause the way I see it,

17:43.129 --> 17:45.530
I'm the only honorable person
in this deal.

17:45.532 --> 17:47.532
And I deserve
to talk to the man.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.667
You wanna sit down
with the president?

17:49.669 --> 17:54.105
To keep remington under wraps,
believe me, it will happen.

17:54.107 --> 17:58.142
Until then, relax.
Enjoy the view.

18:01.146 --> 18:04.449
(birds chirping)

18:04.451 --> 18:05.583
You're rusty, soldier.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.085
Saw you tailing me
this morning.

18:07.087 --> 18:09.754
(click)
shut up.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.657
(jake) you need
to get out of there, liv.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.392
I'll be fine.
How are you feeling?

18:14.394 --> 18:16.260
Are you serious?
Oh, I'm a little sore.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.728
You're in a room
with a bomb.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.630
(jake exhales)

18:19.632 --> 18:20.865
Just get out of there,
okay?

18:20.867 --> 18:23.367
I'll do my best.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.269
(cell phone beeps)

18:25.271 --> 18:26.471
Who was that?

18:27.806 --> 18:31.509
A friend.
Someone who tried to help.

18:31.511 --> 18:32.710
(cell phone clatters)
tried but failed.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.779
Don't give up hope.
My team is out there.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.848
They're working on
getting us that file.

18:36.850 --> 18:38.516
Baby huck's choking.
It's the fbi,

18:38.518 --> 18:39.684
Not the dmv.

18:39.686 --> 18:42.820
She's in a room
with a crazy lady and a bomb.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.522
Did you try setting a...

18:44.524 --> 18:48.292
Virus worm to the firewall
or I.P. Thingy?
(typing)

18:48.294 --> 18:49.660
Do you even know
what you're saying?

18:49.662 --> 18:51.195
Huck's not answering.
I'll try him again.

18:51.197 --> 18:54.832
I'd be worried you weren't
answering your phone,

18:54.834 --> 18:57.869
Today is the day we need
to hack into the fbi,

18:57.871 --> 19:00.805
I have no idea how to hack
into the fbi,

19:00.807 --> 19:04.242
So call me back.
We need you.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.352
(sighs)

19:14.354 --> 19:15.853
(computer beeps)

19:15.855 --> 19:19.157
All right, huck,
what have you been up to?

19:19.159 --> 19:20.791
(typing)

19:20.793 --> 19:23.494
If you're here
to help your boss,

19:23.496 --> 19:25.830
Don't bother. She clearly
has a death wish.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.532
Can you get me access
to the fbi file on the raid?

19:27.534 --> 19:29.834
Nope.
Even if it saves
olivia's life?

19:29.836 --> 19:32.470
Olivia creates more problems
than she solves.

19:32.472 --> 19:33.604
She probably had huck
rig up that bomb vest

19:33.606 --> 19:35.173
And strap it
to that poor mom.

19:35.175 --> 19:37.408
She's an adrenaline junkie.
She needs help.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.843
Which is a backhanded
and guarded way

19:38.845 --> 19:40.211
Of saying
you care about her

19:40.213 --> 19:41.579
And you're worried.
I care, too,

19:41.581 --> 19:42.813
So pony up the file.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.482
I'm not endangering
this cushy gig,

19:44.484 --> 19:45.816
Sticking out my neck
for someone so reckless.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.485
It's called enabling.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.520
Oh, come on.
This isn't even about her.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.322
Let me know
the funeral arrangements.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.357
Should be
good people watching.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.593
Commander boles. I just need
a second to talk to you.

19:55.595 --> 19:58.563
What's going on
with the son's file? Boles!

19:58.565 --> 20:01.599
You told mary nesbitt
she could see it

20:01.601 --> 20:02.800
If she released
some of the hostages.

20:02.802 --> 20:07.238
Then you went back
on your word. Not cool.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.941
You're gonna get a very bad rep
in the hostage-taking community.

20:09.943 --> 20:11.409
(indistinct conversations)

20:11.411 --> 20:12.543
(slams palm)

20:12.545 --> 20:14.378
Harrison, right?
Agent laura kenney.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.913
Look, I'm sure your heart's
in the right place,

20:15.915 --> 20:17.448
But your team's on
the wrong side of this one.

20:17.450 --> 20:20.351
Another fed toeing
the company line.

20:20.353 --> 20:21.419
Look, I feel bad
for the lady. I do.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.554
(scoffs)
she's been through a lot,

20:23.556 --> 20:24.755
But if she were to get ahold
of that file,

20:24.757 --> 20:26.390
See the truth,
it's gonna hurt even worse.

20:26.392 --> 20:29.860
"we will take our pride
of place under the sun

20:29.862 --> 20:32.230
"while the infidels
wilt in darkness.

20:32.232 --> 20:33.931
"they will drown
in the blood of their poor

20:33.933 --> 20:35.566
"who they use as pawns
in their crusade

20:35.568 --> 20:37.235
To plunder and pillage
our blessed lands."

20:37.237 --> 20:39.837
It's a recruitment video--
one of many.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.707
I'm sorry, but chris lawrence
was a terrorist.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.875
And now so is his mother.

20:47.279 --> 20:49.914
They say they have three more
just like the one I saw.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.350
He was a recruiter, liv.

20:52.352 --> 20:53.985
No doubt about it.

21:00.393 --> 21:04.562
To get me this file, or I press
this trigger and we all die.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.030
We're gonna get you
that file.

21:06.032 --> 21:09.700
But you need to prepare yourself
for what might be inside it.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.836
Prepare myself?

21:11.838 --> 21:13.871
To learn that chris was
murdered in cold blood?

21:13.873 --> 21:16.674
I already know that.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.448
(speaking inaudibly)

21:24.450 --> 21:26.584
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

21:28.620 --> 21:30.955
(door closes, engine starts)

21:32.658 --> 21:34.959
Abby, you still at justice?
Ah, struck out.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.527
David won't give up
the file.

21:36.529 --> 21:40.364
I need you to go back.
Okay. What do you got?

21:40.366 --> 21:42.967
You can't look up
one fbi agent for me?

21:42.969 --> 21:44.769
What's in it for me?
Oh, you're pathetic.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.904
You really want dinner
that badly?
Well, now I don't.

21:46.906 --> 21:48.606
What's her name?

21:48.608 --> 21:50.074
Laura kenney.

21:50.076 --> 21:52.510
(typing)

21:52.512 --> 21:53.377
(computer beeps)
nope.

21:53.379 --> 21:54.679
"nope," what?

21:54.681 --> 21:57.348
Nope, laura kenney is not
the name of an fbi agent

21:57.350 --> 21:59.517
Now or ever.

21:59.519 --> 22:01.686
So if she's not fbi,
what is she?

22:01.688 --> 22:03.454
We don't know, but she's
the one who showed up suddenly

22:03.456 --> 22:04.989
With a terrorist
recruitment video.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.724
I see.
She drove off in a car

22:06.726 --> 22:08.592
With state department plates--
not fbi, state--

22:08.594 --> 22:10.394
So whatever this is,
it doesn't match up

22:10.396 --> 22:12.530
With the official story.

22:12.532 --> 22:14.365
She wants to talk to you.

22:14.367 --> 22:16.801
(clears throat) how's life
in the fast lane?

22:16.803 --> 22:19.637
I need a favor.
Call her old-fashioned,
but my boss,

22:19.639 --> 22:20.971
The attorney general,
like, totally hates it

22:20.973 --> 22:23.507
When I aid and abet
terrorists.

22:23.509 --> 22:25.776
The fbi raids a suspected
terrorist's apartment,

22:25.778 --> 22:27.812
Kills a man,
and the investigation is sealed,

22:27.814 --> 22:30.114
No questions asked.
When questions <i>are</i> asked,

22:30.116 --> 22:31.615
An fbi impersonator shows up

22:31.617 --> 22:33.551
Offering the supposedly
sealed evidence

22:33.553 --> 22:35.486
And then disappears
into thin air.

22:35.488 --> 22:38.556
In america right now,
in our nation's capital,

22:38.558 --> 22:40.458
Under your watchful eye.

22:40.460 --> 22:42.626
If that feels right to you,
if that feels like justice

22:42.628 --> 22:44.562
To you, go enjoy your
power lunch at the palm.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.397
If not--
I'll think about it.

22:46.399 --> 22:47.832
Think fast.

22:47.834 --> 22:50.568
(cell phone beeps)

22:50.570 --> 22:53.404
(door closes)
mr. Rosen, what a surprise.
Please, sit.

22:53.406 --> 22:56.974
How are things on 4th street?
Enjoying the new position?

22:56.976 --> 22:59.143
I need to see the file,
cyrus.

22:59.145 --> 23:03.381
The chris lawrence file.
The one his mother's demanding.

23:03.383 --> 23:05.549
The one that proves
that the fbi screwed up

23:05.551 --> 23:07.618
And slaughtered
an innocent man.

23:07.620 --> 23:10.121
I'm sorry if you were expecting
a little more small talk,

23:10.123 --> 23:11.856
But considering
there's a bomb ticking,

23:11.858 --> 23:13.557
I figured I'd cut
to the chase.

23:13.559 --> 23:16.026
(laughs) I think

23:16.028 --> 23:18.729
You misunderstand our deal,
mr. Rosen.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.431
Our deal?
Yes,

23:20.433 --> 23:22.400
The one where you gave me
a certain memory card,

23:22.402 --> 23:24.668
And in return
I gave you a job.

23:24.670 --> 23:26.404
You think that makes me
indebted to you?

23:26.406 --> 23:28.439
I think it means we have
an understanding.

23:29.674 --> 23:32.176
Now I appreciate
your enthusiasm, I do.

23:32.178 --> 23:34.412
You're a good attorney,
a good man,

23:34.414 --> 23:35.679
And, assuming you're here
on olivia's behalf,

23:35.681 --> 23:37.515
A good friend.

23:37.517 --> 23:39.150
But this thing...

23:39.152 --> 23:40.518
That's happening
on the hill today--

23:40.520 --> 23:43.554
That's above your pay grade--
way above.

23:43.556 --> 23:46.757
So... Unless there's
something else I can do for you,

23:46.759 --> 23:49.660
Like receive your thanks for
dragging you out of the gutter

23:49.662 --> 23:52.029
When the only public office
available to you

23:52.031 --> 23:54.865
Was substitute teacher,
then I'm gonna have to

23:54.867 --> 23:57.535
Cut this meeting short.

23:57.537 --> 24:00.037
You know, so the rest of us
who actually earned our jobs

24:00.039 --> 24:04.842
Can go back to the business
of running the country.

24:04.844 --> 24:07.678
Do I have to call security,
mr. Rosen?

24:08.980 --> 24:10.648
Gordon bates.

24:14.786 --> 24:16.220
Excuse me?

24:16.222 --> 24:18.055
The fbi agent
who led the raid.

24:18.057 --> 24:21.025
He was fired from his post
a week after the raid went down,

24:21.027 --> 24:22.693
No explanation.

24:22.695 --> 24:25.229
Then there's... Teresa gomez.

24:25.231 --> 24:27.598
"special agent gomez
served under bates.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.700
A week after the raid,
she got a promotion."

24:29.702 --> 24:32.903
Ditto, jeffrey mullins.
Ditto, kevin choi.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.839
In fact, everyone involved
in the raid

24:34.841 --> 24:37.141
Who wasn't bates
got a huge pay increase,

24:37.143 --> 24:40.010
Even the rookie who was
three weeks out of quantico.

24:40.012 --> 24:41.645
Where did you get that?

24:41.647 --> 24:44.014
Oh, it turns out that
personnel files--

24:44.016 --> 24:47.184
Way more easy to obtain
than classified ones.

24:47.186 --> 24:49.787
So what do you make
of this, eh?

24:49.789 --> 24:51.822
Team of agents rewarded
for killing a terrorist,

24:51.824 --> 24:54.592
Or a group of people paid
to keep their mouths shut

24:54.594 --> 24:57.094
After one of them
screwed the pooch?

24:57.096 --> 24:59.230
I'm guessing the latter.

24:59.232 --> 25:00.698
Just like I'm guessing
that the head of the d.N.C.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.666
Would be thrilled to have
a copy of this

25:02.668 --> 25:03.934
As we head
into the next election.

25:03.936 --> 25:07.538
What's that phrase again?
"October surprise."

25:07.540 --> 25:08.539
Now you listen to me--

25:08.541 --> 25:10.674
No, you listen to me.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.743
I may not have the cytron card
anymore,

25:12.745 --> 25:14.578
But I do have my conscience,

25:14.580 --> 25:16.580
And there's a hell of a lot
of noise I can make

25:16.582 --> 25:20.751
If I don't think you're worthy
of the moral sacrifice I made.

25:20.753 --> 25:23.687
It is not
what you think it is.

25:23.689 --> 25:25.222
No?

25:25.224 --> 25:27.758
Then prove it to me.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.994
Show me the file.

25:29.996 --> 25:31.695
<i>(woman) heading into hour ten,</i>

25:31.697 --> 25:34.865
<i>As the fbi continues</i>
<i>to negotiate</i>

25:34.867 --> 25:37.001
<i>With mary nesbitt,</i>
<i>hoping to convince her</i>

25:37.003 --> 25:39.603
<i>To free the two remaining</i>
<i>hostages being held</i>

25:39.605 --> 25:42.106
<i>On the fourth floor</i>
<i>of the u.S. Capitol building.</i>

25:42.108 --> 25:44.074
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

25:44.076 --> 25:45.910
Did you know they wouldn't
even bury him?

25:45.912 --> 25:47.211
'cause they said
he's a terrorist,

25:47.213 --> 25:49.246
No funeral home
would even take him.

25:49.248 --> 25:51.282
He's been lying
in the city morgue for months,

25:51.284 --> 25:54.585
Unburied, unclaimed.

25:54.587 --> 25:57.655
Mary--
(telephone rings)

25:57.657 --> 25:58.956
(ring)
here we go.

25:58.958 --> 26:01.625
(ring)

26:01.627 --> 26:03.561
(sighs)

26:03.563 --> 26:05.796
(clicks)
olivia.

26:05.798 --> 26:07.965
I'm standing here with cyrus

26:07.967 --> 26:09.266
And david rosen

26:09.268 --> 26:11.201
And the head
of counterintelligence.

26:11.203 --> 26:13.904
What I'm about to tell you
is classified information,

26:13.906 --> 26:17.608
I need you not to respond
to what I'm about to say.

26:17.610 --> 26:18.742
Can you do that for me?

26:18.744 --> 26:20.144
Yes.

26:20.146 --> 26:21.712
Good.

26:21.714 --> 26:23.581
She's right.

26:23.583 --> 26:25.616
I'm sorry?

26:25.618 --> 26:29.119
Chris lawrence
was not a terrorist.

26:29.121 --> 26:32.590
Chris lawrence was cia.

26:32.592 --> 26:34.625
He infiltrated
the al-qaeda network

26:34.627 --> 26:37.595
At the highest levels,
brought other c.I.A. Operatives

26:37.597 --> 26:40.598
Into the organization
as his fake recruits.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.099
Chris lawrence
was an american hero,

26:42.101 --> 26:44.301
Perhaps
one of the greatest heroes

26:44.303 --> 26:45.769
Our nation will ever have,

26:45.771 --> 26:47.905
But you can't tell
his mother that.

26:47.907 --> 26:49.206
You can't tell anybody that,

26:49.208 --> 26:51.141
Because if you did,

26:51.143 --> 26:54.178
The 57 men and women
that he recruited,

26:54.180 --> 26:56.380
Whose very lives depend
on maintaining their identities

26:56.382 --> 26:59.316
As enemies
of the United States--

26:59.318 --> 27:01.952
They'll be tortured
until they die.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.021
And a decade's worth
of intelligence gathering

27:04.023 --> 27:05.255
Will die with them.

27:07.359 --> 27:10.661
Chris lawrence was killed
by the fbi

27:10.663 --> 27:14.365
Because they did not know
his true loyalties.

27:14.367 --> 27:17.635
And that...
Was a terrible mistake.

27:17.637 --> 27:22.406
But it made him a martyr
to al-qaeda

27:22.408 --> 27:24.274
And a hero
to the United States.

27:24.276 --> 27:26.110
And I am very sorry--

27:26.112 --> 27:29.213
Everyone is very sorry--

27:29.215 --> 27:31.715
That chris lawrence's mother
will never know the truth,

27:31.717 --> 27:34.752
But 57 lives depend on that,

27:34.754 --> 27:36.220
That no one ever

27:36.222 --> 27:37.788
Knows the truth.

27:37.790 --> 27:39.990
There are
57 other american heroes

27:39.992 --> 27:41.925
Whose names their country
will never know,

27:41.927 --> 27:43.827
And it's our job,

27:43.829 --> 27:45.229
Our duty,

27:45.231 --> 27:49.333
To bring those 57 heroes
home alive.

27:51.703 --> 27:53.237
Do you understand?

27:54.172 --> 27:55.239
No.

27:55.241 --> 27:56.373
No?

27:56.375 --> 27:58.742
But thank you
for the true story.

27:58.744 --> 28:00.010
Olivia, you cannot tell her
the truth.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.378
(whispers) don't make me
do this to her.

28:01.380 --> 28:05.015
57 of our bravest assets.
Is the truth worth that?

28:14.426 --> 28:16.226
I have to go now.
Olivia--

28:16.228 --> 28:18.395
Thank you, mr. President.
Olivia pope,

28:18.397 --> 28:20.264
Do not hang up.
I need you to acknowledge.

28:20.266 --> 28:24.768
(line disconnects, dial tone)

28:24.770 --> 28:27.471
That was the president.

28:27.473 --> 28:29.440
What did he say?

28:30.742 --> 28:32.009
(gasps softly)

28:35.413 --> 28:37.281
I'm so sorry, mary.

28:38.950 --> 28:40.384
No.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.286
(sobs softly) no...

28:42.288 --> 28:43.454
No.

28:43.456 --> 28:45.189
Your son was a terrorist.

28:45.191 --> 28:47.391
No! No!
He was a high-level

28:47.393 --> 28:49.226
Al-qaeda operative...
(screaming)

28:49.228 --> 28:50.928
Higher than they wanted
to make public.
No!

28:50.930 --> 28:52.463
That's what was
in the file.
No!

28:52.465 --> 28:53.931
That's what was classified.
(sobbing) no!

28:53.933 --> 28:55.466
Oh, god. Oh, my god.

28:55.468 --> 28:57.267
(sobbing) oh, no...

28:57.269 --> 29:00.270
(continues sobbing)

29:00.272 --> 29:02.139
I am so, so sorry.

29:02.141 --> 29:05.409
(breath quavers) I'm going to
see you through this, mary,

29:05.411 --> 29:08.045
Make sure you have
the best defense possible.

29:08.047 --> 29:10.380
Our work isn't done.
You're still my client.

29:10.382 --> 29:13.751
(sobbing continues)

29:13.753 --> 29:16.754
This is congressman struthers!
I'm opening the door!

29:16.756 --> 29:18.455
We're coming out peacefully!

29:18.457 --> 29:21.859
Nice and slow,
one by one, hands raised.

29:32.370 --> 29:34.538
<i>Aah! No! Mary!</i>

29:34.540 --> 29:36.173
(man shouting indistinctly)
<i>mary, open the door!</i>

29:36.175 --> 29:37.441
Pull 'em out.
Get 'em out of there!

29:37.443 --> 29:38.842
Ma'am!
(all shouting at once)

29:38.844 --> 29:40.344
Move!
(shouting continues)

29:40.346 --> 29:41.812
Clear! Clear!
No!

29:41.814 --> 29:43.213
Code black, code black!

29:43.215 --> 29:45.449
(explosion, rapid beeping)

29:45.451 --> 29:48.085
(static hissing)
<i>(boles) victor four, come in.</i>
<i>Report status.</i>

29:48.087 --> 29:50.354
Someone talk to me!
<i>Come in, victor four!</i>

29:50.356 --> 29:53.423
(beeping)

30:02.201 --> 30:06.804
Was confined to the office suite
where the detonation took place.

30:06.806 --> 30:09.907
The fbi, in coordination
with the white house

30:09.909 --> 30:12.943
And homeland security,
performed professionally

30:12.945 --> 30:14.845
And heroically throughout.

30:14.847 --> 30:17.981
I have ordered a review
of our security measures

30:17.983 --> 30:20.350
On capitol hill and throughout
the federal complex

30:20.352 --> 30:24.121
In order to avoid
another such incident,

30:24.123 --> 30:25.589
And can assure
the american people

30:25.591 --> 30:27.591
That we will remain vigilant.

30:27.593 --> 30:29.393
(siren wails)

30:29.395 --> 30:31.862
(quinn panting)
olivia.

30:31.864 --> 30:34.064
Are you okay?
Do you need anything?

30:34.066 --> 30:38.569
I'm sorry. Okay? But there is
something you need to know.

30:38.571 --> 30:42.973
I was worried about huck,
so I-I did some digging, and...

30:42.975 --> 30:45.242
Look, huck's obsessed
with your dad.

30:45.244 --> 30:47.411
Liv, he was up all night
researching

30:47.413 --> 30:49.246
Everything
there is to know about him.

30:53.284 --> 30:54.618
(slurps)

30:54.620 --> 30:56.987
(footsteps approach)

30:56.989 --> 30:59.022
(exhales)

31:05.063 --> 31:06.330
(clicks switch)

31:24.115 --> 31:25.215
(gasps)
(laughs)

31:25.217 --> 31:28.118
It's hooch.

31:28.120 --> 31:29.920
My daddy sent us that case

31:29.922 --> 31:31.555
When you won the election,
remember?

31:31.557 --> 31:34.224
Made it himself, said we should
use it to celebrate.

31:34.226 --> 31:37.094
(inhales sharply)
you called him a hillbilly.

31:37.096 --> 31:39.296
(slurps)

31:39.298 --> 31:42.065
How many presidents have
had sex on this table,

31:42.067 --> 31:43.634
Do you think?

31:43.636 --> 31:45.135
(sighs)

31:45.137 --> 31:47.070
Do you want to have sex...

31:47.072 --> 31:48.272
Here?

31:49.274 --> 31:51.441
With me, I mean?

31:51.443 --> 31:53.110
(exhales sharply)

31:53.112 --> 31:55.312
I couldn't eat on this if you
had sex with somebody else.

31:55.314 --> 31:57.915
It'd have to be burned.
You're drunk.

31:57.917 --> 32:00.250
That's impossible.
A lady never gets drunk.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.653
(groans) you're drunk,
mellie.

32:02.655 --> 32:06.556
Yeah. (giggles)

32:06.558 --> 32:08.325
But like I said,
I am celebratin'.

32:10.161 --> 32:11.161
Celebrating?

32:11.163 --> 32:14.097
Today was a good day.

32:14.099 --> 32:17.601
I would think the last thing
you'd want to do is celebrate.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.569
I would think you'd be
miserable.

32:19.571 --> 32:22.439
You missed out on
your happy ending today.

32:22.441 --> 32:25.943
Olivia pope
being blown to bits?

32:25.945 --> 32:27.277
That's your dream,
isn't it?

32:27.279 --> 32:30.714
Oh, no.

32:30.716 --> 32:32.950
That's my nightmare.

32:32.952 --> 32:35.218
If your whore had died today,
brave and strong,

32:35.220 --> 32:38.989
Protecting a congressman
inside the capitol

32:38.991 --> 32:40.123
With a nation watching...

32:40.125 --> 32:41.625
(huffs)

32:41.627 --> 32:44.628
Honey, the nails, the wood,

32:44.630 --> 32:48.165
The... Cross you would build

32:48.167 --> 32:50.267
And hammer her on,

32:50.269 --> 32:52.202
The worship you would feel
for the rest of your days

32:52.204 --> 32:55.305
Down on your knees
praying to saint olivia pope,

32:55.307 --> 32:58.008
That would be...

32:58.010 --> 33:00.277
(sighs deeply)

33:02.647 --> 33:04.181
I'd lose.

33:06.184 --> 33:08.385
Our little war.

33:10.455 --> 33:13.156
I'd lose.

33:13.158 --> 33:16.293
(inhales sharply)
I am spectacular, but...

33:16.295 --> 33:19.396
(exhales) I can't compete
with religious fervor,

33:19.398 --> 33:21.999
So, no, I was not hoping

33:22.001 --> 33:23.734
That she would be
blown up today.

33:23.736 --> 33:28.238
I am not miserable
that she survived.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.140
I am celebratin'.

33:30.142 --> 33:33.777
Because olivia pope
still walks this earth.

33:33.779 --> 33:36.179
She's still alive.
(pounds table)

33:36.181 --> 33:38.448
And as long as she's
still alive,

33:38.450 --> 33:41.451
Well, she's your flaw.

33:41.453 --> 33:44.054
(snickers)

33:44.056 --> 33:46.123
Your achilles' heel.

33:47.258 --> 33:49.326
Which makes her my weapon.

33:50.795 --> 33:53.230
She's the strings that,
if need be,

33:53.232 --> 33:58.535
I will pull to make
my puppet husband dance.

34:02.607 --> 34:06.309
(inhales sharply)
so cheers, baby.

34:06.311 --> 34:07.544
(glasses clink)

34:07.546 --> 34:10.313
Drink up.
I live to fight another day!

34:10.315 --> 34:13.250
(giggles)

34:14.719 --> 34:16.219
(switch clicks)

34:19.290 --> 34:21.191
(sighs)

34:30.835 --> 34:32.702
(gasps)

34:32.704 --> 34:34.337
(breathing heavily)

34:34.339 --> 34:37.207
Huck...

34:37.209 --> 34:39.209
You scared me.

34:41.312 --> 34:43.313
You okay?

34:48.187 --> 34:52.289
Don't worry.
I'm not here to kill you.

34:52.291 --> 34:54.224
I'm all killed out today.

34:56.461 --> 34:58.328
Huck, you didn't.

34:59.797 --> 35:04.201
Huck, please tell me you
did not just kill my father.

35:06.671 --> 35:07.671
Huck!

35:07.673 --> 35:09.539
<i>What?!</i>

35:10.842 --> 35:14.478
All this time I've wondered
who command is.

35:14.480 --> 35:16.346
I've banged my head
against the wall

35:16.348 --> 35:18.815
Trying to get a name,
and then I got one...

35:18.817 --> 35:20.217
From you.

35:22.186 --> 35:24.354
A name is something
you can trace, liv.

35:24.356 --> 35:28.291
It's something you can
tie to a chair and question.

35:28.293 --> 35:32.195
After you've drilled
some answers out of it,

35:32.197 --> 35:35.398
Like whether or not
you have a family,

35:35.400 --> 35:37.167
It's something you can kill.

35:37.169 --> 35:40.604
You can wrap it in plastic
and put it in a dumpster

35:40.606 --> 35:42.672
So it never bothers you
again.

35:44.308 --> 35:45.208
(huffs)

35:46.677 --> 35:48.245
Huck, look at me.

35:48.247 --> 35:51.348
This should have been
my day, liv.

35:51.350 --> 35:53.316
I should have had
some peace.

35:53.318 --> 35:55.886
Look at me.

35:59.323 --> 36:01.525
<i>Look at me!</i>
<i>(pounds table)</i>

36:04.695 --> 36:07.264
Did...

36:07.266 --> 36:10.167
You...

36:10.169 --> 36:12.736
(voice breaks)
kill my father?

36:23.848 --> 36:25.415
No.

36:25.417 --> 36:28.785
(birds chirping)

36:28.787 --> 36:29.920
You're rusty, soldier.

36:29.922 --> 36:31.354
Saw you tailing me
this morning.

36:31.356 --> 36:33.356
(click)
shut up.

36:34.825 --> 36:38.762
Happy to see you finally worked
up the nerve to say hello.

36:38.764 --> 36:41.665
Got some unfinished business
for you inside--

36:41.667 --> 36:43.800
A gift, all wrapped up
and ready for you.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.268
Go ahead.

36:45.270 --> 36:46.503
Open it.

36:54.979 --> 36:58.682
(exhaling deeply)

37:01.285 --> 37:04.955
Command. Your father,
even after all that time...

37:04.957 --> 37:06.756
(voice breaking)
even after everything,

37:06.758 --> 37:10.460
He owns me. I can't...

37:10.462 --> 37:11.928
There's nothing.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.997
(grunts)
(rattling)

37:13.999 --> 37:16.800
Hey, man.
Get me out of these.

37:16.802 --> 37:19.903
(panting)

37:23.474 --> 37:24.941
No, whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:24.943 --> 37:29.312
No, no, no, no.
Don't do this.

37:29.314 --> 37:31.815
Wait.
I could give you things.

37:31.817 --> 37:35.452
No. I know things!
(ripping)

37:35.454 --> 37:37.554
I know things.

37:37.556 --> 37:40.257
I-I'm telling you...
(muffled grunt)

37:40.259 --> 37:42.993
I'm gonna write you
a beautiful suicide note.

37:42.995 --> 37:47.364
(muffled grunting)
(handcuffs clanking)

37:49.333 --> 37:53.403
There's nothing I can do.
I...

37:53.405 --> 37:56.573
I thought I was free,
but I'm not.

37:56.575 --> 37:58.842
He controls me.

37:58.844 --> 38:01.444
He still controls me.

38:01.446 --> 38:04.381
(breathing heavily)

38:04.383 --> 38:06.616
(projector and camera shutter
click)

38:11.289 --> 38:12.989
(handle clicks)

38:12.991 --> 38:15.058
(projector and camera shutter
click)

38:15.060 --> 38:17.794
He owns me, liv.

38:17.796 --> 38:20.530
He owns me.
(sobbing) he owns me!

38:20.532 --> 38:21.531
Shh.

38:21.533 --> 38:24.034
He owns me...
(pounds table)

38:24.036 --> 38:27.304
(continues sobbing)

38:30.775 --> 38:32.309
(projector and camera shutter
click)

38:42.987 --> 38:44.321
You must be starving.

38:44.323 --> 38:46.589
Did you know gettysburger
delivers?

38:46.591 --> 38:47.791
Right to the door.

38:47.793 --> 38:49.359
Been dreaming of burgers.

38:49.361 --> 38:51.394
(kisses) hey.

38:51.396 --> 38:53.963
Why are you here?

38:56.000 --> 38:58.935
Oh, I can go if--I'm sorry.
I thought, uh--
no.

38:58.937 --> 39:02.872
I mean, <i>how</i> are you here?

39:02.874 --> 39:04.074
How?

39:04.076 --> 39:06.643
(cell phone chimes)

39:08.045 --> 39:09.479
(chiming continues)

39:09.481 --> 39:10.947
Are you gonna get that?

39:10.949 --> 39:13.850
How are you here?

39:13.852 --> 39:16.119
(exhales) I don't--
I don't know what you mean.

39:16.121 --> 39:18.121
They didn't just...
Let you out.

39:18.123 --> 39:20.724
They don't just <i>let</i>
<i>people like you out,</i>

39:20.726 --> 39:22.792
So how are you here?
Olivia--

39:22.794 --> 39:25.362
<i>How</i> are you here?! <i>How?!</i>

39:25.364 --> 39:28.531
(second cell phone rings,
chiming continues)

39:28.533 --> 39:32.535
(phones continue ringing
and chiming)

39:32.537 --> 39:35.004
It's the president.

39:35.006 --> 39:36.639
I'm thinking about calling this
the fitz-phone.

39:36.641 --> 39:39.042
Are you spying on me?
Is that it?

39:39.044 --> 39:40.110
No, I'm not.

39:40.112 --> 39:41.845
(ring)

39:41.847 --> 39:43.446
Will you answer
one of these?

39:43.448 --> 39:45.682
(ringing and chiming continue)

39:45.684 --> 39:47.517
(cell phones clatter)
liv--liv!

39:47.519 --> 39:49.119
Did he send you
to watch me?

39:49.121 --> 39:51.554
To report my every move
back to him?!

39:51.556 --> 39:54.557
"he"?
You mean your father?

39:54.559 --> 39:57.827
<i>Nobody</i> gets out. <i>Nobody.</i>

39:57.829 --> 40:00.163
So I wanna know...

40:00.165 --> 40:01.865
Why did he release you?

40:01.867 --> 40:03.166
I don't know.
He didn't give me a reason.

40:03.168 --> 40:04.934
But there is one...
Liv--liv--

40:04.936 --> 40:06.970
With him,
there is always a reason!

40:06.972 --> 40:11.875
I don't know why he let me go.
I have no idea. None.

40:11.877 --> 40:15.011
Your guess is as good as mine.
I do not know.

40:15.013 --> 40:17.046
(exhales deeply)

40:32.763 --> 40:35.565
Nobody... Walks away
from him.

40:35.567 --> 40:39.769
He controls... Everything.

40:39.771 --> 40:44.774
I need to know...
How are you here?

40:55.219 --> 40:58.588
I never thought
I'd get out of that hole.

40:58.590 --> 41:02.192
And it's not just the...
Dirt floor and the darkness

41:02.194 --> 41:03.193
That gets you.

41:03.195 --> 41:08.465
It's... The isolation.
It's...

41:08.467 --> 41:11.601
Silence. It breaks
something in you, and...

41:11.603 --> 41:16.473
I just kept picturing
your face.

41:21.612 --> 41:23.213
Your face saved me.

41:24.915 --> 41:26.683
I'm here because
you saved me.

41:26.685 --> 41:29.052
(gasps)

41:30.988 --> 41:34.257
(voice breaking)
this is not a fairy tale.

41:34.259 --> 41:36.759
This is not
the happily ever after.

41:36.761 --> 41:40.930
If you're still alive,
it's because he still owns you.

41:40.932 --> 41:43.867
It's because you're still
useful to him,

41:43.869 --> 41:47.136
And he's... Going to find
a way to use you against me.

41:47.138 --> 41:48.204
Liv--

41:48.206 --> 41:50.807
Don't feel bad about it.

41:50.809 --> 41:53.243
He still owns me, too.

42:02.186 --> 42:07.624
(telephone rings)

42:07.626 --> 42:10.193
(ring)

42:12.162 --> 42:15.064
(ring)

42:17.134 --> 42:20.069
(ring)

42:23.807 --> 42:27.677
(projector and camera shutter
