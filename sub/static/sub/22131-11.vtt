ON ONE HAND, YOU'RE
THE BEST LIFEGUARD TO COME

39:03.689 --> 39:04.516
BY BAYWATCH
IN THE LAST TEN YEARS.

39:05.604 --> 39:08.781
ON THE OTHER, I HAVE BEEN
LOOKING FOR AN EXCUSE

39:08.911 --> 39:09.999
TO GO TO SYDNEY NEXT YEAR.

39:20.009 --> 39:22.316
BAYWATCH HEADQUARTERS

39:23.056 --> 39:23.839
HEY, MITCH.

39:23.970 --> 39:24.884
HEY!

39:25.145 --> 39:26.407
-YOU GOING TO WORK OUT?
-YUP.

39:26.538 --> 39:28.627
HEY, MIND IF I WALK ALONG
FOR A MINUTE?

39:28.757 --> 39:29.628
SURE.

39:30.629 --> 39:32.195
HEY, WHAT WAS GOING ON
WITH NEWMIE THIS MORNING?

39:32.326 --> 39:33.153
WHAT WAS HE SO UPSET ABOUT?

39:33.283 --> 39:34.241
WHAT WAS WITH ALL THOSE ROSES?

39:34.372 --> 39:36.156
UH, THAT'S A LONG STORY

39:36.286 --> 39:37.940
AND I THINK HE SHOULD TELL YOU
HIMSELF.

39:38.941 --> 39:40.465
OK.

39:40.595 --> 39:42.902
LISTEN, I WAS THINKING ABOUT
SOMETHING YOU SAID LAST NIGHT.

39:43.032 --> 39:44.425
WHAT'S THAT?

39:44.556 --> 39:46.427
WELL, YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT ME
BECOMING LIEUTENANT

39:46.558 --> 39:47.950
AND YOU SAID THAT I COULD.

39:48.081 --> 39:49.691
I SAID THE JOB IS YOURS.

39:50.300 --> 39:51.389
DOES THAT OFFER STILL STAND?

39:52.955 --> 39:54.000
ABSOLUTELY.

39:54.130 --> 39:55.044
GOOD, I ACCEPT.

39:55.958 --> 39:58.787
HAVE YOU WRITTEN THE APPRAISAL
OF PROMOTABILITY YET?

39:58.918 --> 39:59.701
STILL WORKING ON IT.

39:59.832 --> 40:01.399
-CAN I SEE IT?
-NOPE.

40:01.921 --> 40:03.575
COME ON, LOOK, IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M GOING TO REWRITE YOU.

40:03.705 --> 40:05.315
I WON'T CHANGE A SINGLE WORD,
I PROMISE.

40:05.446 --> 40:06.534
SPEAKING OF CHANGE,

40:06.665 --> 40:09.407
YOU OWE ME $47.13 FOR DINNER
LAST NIGHT.

40:09.537 --> 40:10.320
WHAT?

40:10.451 --> 40:11.931
PLUS $25 FOR THE DESSERT CART.

40:12.540 --> 40:13.672
OH COME ON,
THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

40:13.802 --> 40:14.847
THEY CAN'T CHARGE ME FOR THAT.

40:14.977 --> 40:16.239
THEY DIDN'T CHARGE YOU,
THEY CHARGED ME.

40:17.327 --> 40:18.677
YOU KNOW, THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

40:18.807 --> 40:19.808
I'M GOING TO CALL THE MANAGER.

40:19.939 --> 40:21.027
YOU STILL GOT THAT RECEIPT?

40:21.157 --> 40:22.289
YEAH, BUT I ALREADY TALKED
TO THE MANAGER

40:22.420 --> 40:23.812
AND THEY WANT 25 BUCKS
FOR THE CART.

40:23.943 --> 40:25.161
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA PAY IT.

40:25.292 --> 40:27.250
ALEX, YOU KNOCKED THE CART OVER.

40:27.381 --> 40:29.992
YOU KNOW WHAT, IT WAS
BECAUSE YOU MADE ME SO MAD.

40:30.123 --> 40:31.429
YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T START
THE WHOLE THING.

40:31.559 --> 40:32.430
YOU STARTED IT.

40:36.869 --> 40:38.697
I'LL BE BACK IN THREE WEEKS,
RIGHT AFTER THE NATIONALS.

40:38.827 --> 40:39.611
GOOD LUCK.

40:39.741 --> 40:40.612

40:40.742 --> 40:41.743
YOU CAN DO IT!

40:41.874 --> 40:43.832
EH, WHATEVER HAPPENS HAPPENS.

40:44.616 --> 40:45.921
HEY,
JUST DON'T GIVE AWAY MY LOCKER!

40:46.052 --> 40:47.575
NOT A CHANCE.

40:47.706 --> 40:48.663

[LAUGHING]

40:52.275 --> 40:53.799

AND WATCH HIM SWIM.

41:02.198 --> 41:03.069
YOU'RE ON, BUDDY.

41:03.765 --> 41:04.766
YOU KNOW, NEWMIE,
I'VE BEEN MEANING

41:04.897 --> 41:05.767
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

41:06.464 --> 41:07.900
I MAY HAVE JUMPED THE GUN
THE OTHER DAY

41:08.030 --> 41:09.815
WHEN I SAID I WASN'T INTERESTED
IN ALEX.

41:09.945 --> 41:11.643
OH,
SO YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ALEX?

41:11.773 --> 41:13.993
WELL, IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT I MIGHT BE INTERESTED

41:14.123 --> 41:15.821
AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THAT'S COOL WITH YOU.

41:16.604 --> 41:17.910
HAVE YOU DISCUSSED THIS
WITH ALEX?

41:18.040 --> 41:19.651
NO, BECAUSE I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT IT FIRST.

41:20.608 --> 41:23.089
WELL YOU KNOW SOMETHING MITCH,
I APPRECIATE THAT

41:23.219 --> 41:24.438
BUT I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.

41:24.569 --> 41:25.395
WHY NOT?

41:25.526 --> 41:26.614
HEY, NEWMIE!

41:27.136 --> 41:28.834
HANG ON, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

41:31.140 --> 41:32.664
ALEX AND I ARE GOING SURFING.

41:32.794 --> 41:33.839

41:33.969 --> 41:35.057
