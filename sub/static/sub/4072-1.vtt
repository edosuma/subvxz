<i>It's Mojo Radio back on the air.</i>

01:08.235 --> 01:11.696
<i>Slamming Sammy here.
Football time in Texas.</i>

01:11.780 --> 01:14.574
<i>Let's go to the phone. We
got Butch on the line with us.</i>

01:14.658 --> 01:17.118
<i>Butch, what about it? We'll
have a great year, or what?</i>

01:17.202 --> 01:18.202
<i>How you doing?</i>

01:18.287 --> 01:20.079
<i>Good.
Tell me about this season.</i>

01:20.164 --> 01:22.457
<i>We're gonna have a hell
of a season this year.</i>

01:22.541 --> 01:24.959
<i>Winchell's gonna
take us all the way.</i>

01:25.043 --> 01:26.794
Deep slant
trips stacked right?

01:26.879 --> 01:29.338
Primary receiver's inside flanker.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.506
"Z" burst.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.341
My linemen are
in 80 pass block.

01:32.426 --> 01:33.551
How deep is your drop?

01:33.635 --> 01:35.011
Five steps.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.847
Five steps.
Trips stacked left?

01:37.931 --> 01:39.640
Inside 8-yard curl.

01:39.725 --> 01:41.434
You gonna get
a scholarship?

01:42.728 --> 01:43.728
Yes, Mom.

01:43.812 --> 01:44.812
"Z" receiver.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.108
<i>It's Mojo Radio, Slamming Sammy,</i>

01:49.193 --> 01:50.651
<i>and I've got
Jerry on the line</i>

01:50.736 --> 01:53.780
<i>from the Sonic down there.
Jerry, there's a lot of talk</i>

01:53.864 --> 01:57.742
<i>that Coach Gaines, with
that $60,000 a year salary...</i>

01:57.826 --> 01:59.327
<i>I know where
we're going with this.</i>

01:59.411 --> 02:02.288
<i>He makes a little bit more than
the principal of the school...</i>

02:02.372 --> 02:04.332
<i>Just last week,</i>

02:04.416 --> 02:06.501
<i>I was reading this
book about Babe Ruth</i>

02:06.585 --> 02:08.919
<i>and they asked him if
he deserved his salary</i>

02:09.003 --> 02:12.548
<i>way back in 1910 or
1904, whatever it was</i>

02:12.633 --> 02:13.966
<i>and he said,
"Hey, you know..."</i>

02:14.051 --> 02:16.052
<i>They said, "You make
more than the President."</i>

02:16.136 --> 02:18.971
<i>He says, "Well, you know, can
the President hit a baseball?"</i>

02:19.056 --> 02:21.432
<i>I'm telling you,
Coach Gary Gaines,</i>

02:21.517 --> 02:23.810
<i>they could give
him $100,000/year</i>

02:23.894 --> 02:25.895
<i>and if these
boys go undefeated,</i>

02:25.979 --> 02:27.980
<i>it's worth
every single dollar.</i>

02:28.065 --> 02:31.776
<i>I tell you what, the principal of
Permian don't get 28,000 people...</i>

02:32.110 --> 02:34.111
I have two to three
seconds of protection

02:34.196 --> 02:36.197
if my linemen are
in 80 pass block.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.406
Wide receiver?

02:37.491 --> 02:39.242
He runs, burst route.

02:40.285 --> 02:44.831
If he sees cover two, he
bends outside 8 to 12 yards.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.917
20 yards, and runs
straight to the sideline.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.920
Are you ready for this,
Mike?

03:40.679 --> 03:42.096
- Yo.
- Ivory.

03:45.267 --> 03:46.934
Ready to work?
What's up, Boobie?

03:47.019 --> 03:48.728
State.
State.

03:48.812 --> 03:49.979
State?

04:05.329 --> 04:07.872
Where your girlfriend at, Water Bug?

04:08.457 --> 04:10.416
- Well...
- We ain't got a girlfriend yet?

04:10.500 --> 04:12.418
Come on, let's go.
Snap it up.

04:13.337 --> 04:16.839
You wanna know why you ain't
got a girl yet, Water Bug?

04:16.923 --> 04:18.089
Why?

04:18.175 --> 04:20.343
You got the wrong shoes on,
man.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.055
You got on white Adidas.

04:24.139 --> 04:26.432
Everybody know
the shoe is Nikes.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.601
Nothing holds a nickel next to Nike.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.937
Ask Ivory.
Ask Preacher Man.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.772
What kind of shoes on
your feet don't matter.

04:32.856 --> 04:34.774
Come on, Preacher. Bullshit.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.025
Don't matter at all.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.819
You know God
made black beautiful.

04:38.904 --> 04:42.281
God made Boobie beautiful,
black and strong.

04:42.366 --> 04:44.951
His mouth keeps getting
bigger and bigger.

04:45.035 --> 04:46.535
And when Boobie
knocks some fools out

04:46.620 --> 04:49.956
Boobie gonna knock them out
with black Nikes on his feet.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.874
I could knock you out
in a pair of flip-flops.

04:51.959 --> 04:55.628
Yeah, well, I'm gonna knock
them out with Nikes on my feet

04:55.712 --> 04:57.630
and I'm gonna
smile when I do.

05:20.070 --> 05:22.029
Let's go.
Five minutes.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.567
Get up. Let's go!

06:10.954 --> 06:13.789
How y'all doing up there?
You all doing all right?

06:13.874 --> 06:17.376
45, Boobie, that's
my nephew out there.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.463
The boy can play some
football, I'm telling you.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.506
I think he'll win
the Heisman Trophy someday.

06:22.591 --> 06:23.632
The Heisman,
really?

06:23.717 --> 06:25.009
Yes, sir.
You can bet on it.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.135
I got it.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.386
Who's you
guys' favorite player?

06:27.471 --> 06:28.596
Boobie Miles.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.557
He can spin left. He can spin right.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.059
Don't make no difference.

06:33.143 --> 06:37.021
He can block, tackle, score
the touchdown, snap the ball

06:37.105 --> 06:39.190
hold the snap and
kick the extra point.

06:39.274 --> 06:42.068
Hell, the boy will fill
up the Gatorade cooler

06:42.152 --> 06:44.820
walk the dog and
paint your back porch.

06:45.447 --> 06:49.825
I'm telling you, that boy
can flat out play football.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.039
And he can pass!

06:55.916 --> 06:57.374
Should
we believe the hype?

06:57.459 --> 06:58.417
What hype?

06:58.502 --> 06:59.502
The hype about Boobie Miles.

06:59.586 --> 07:03.506
No, hype is something
that's not for real. I'm all real.

07:05.801 --> 07:07.802
I'm Chris Comer.
I'm a running back.

07:07.886 --> 07:10.429
So that means you're Boobie's backup?

07:10.514 --> 07:14.100
I'm actually Boobie's backup
backup. I'm third string right now.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.559
You know which way
you're supposed to run?

07:15.644 --> 07:17.061
Yeah, with strong right...

07:17.145 --> 07:18.479
I ain't talking
about the play.

07:18.563 --> 07:22.108
I know what
the play was, okay?

07:22.192 --> 07:24.193
Odessa is a small town

07:24.694 --> 07:27.363
and when you screw up,
everybody knows about it.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.323
Your dad played at Permian.

07:29.407 --> 07:31.325
What's it like to be
the son of a local legend?

07:31.409 --> 07:33.828
Hold on to the damn ball,
Donny.

07:35.831 --> 07:37.206
Next question.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.791
There it goes!

07:39.251 --> 07:40.459
How are
your grades, Boobie?

07:40.544 --> 07:42.670
I get straight A's.
I'm an athlete.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.338
In what subject?

07:44.422 --> 07:46.298
There's only one subject.
It's football.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.509
Ain't no other subject,
you know?

07:48.593 --> 07:49.593
Hut!

07:54.975 --> 07:57.268
You sure he's part
of your gene pool, Charlie?

07:57.352 --> 07:58.435
Shit!

08:00.230 --> 08:02.481
Red alert, everybody.

08:02.566 --> 08:03.941
What
about the expectations

08:04.025 --> 08:06.610
of coaching a team like this
in a community like this?

08:06.695 --> 08:08.445
Well, I guess

08:08.530 --> 08:10.322
there's always a surprise
or two in every community.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.950
Just concentrate on hanging
on the ball. Both hands.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.285
Hey, Donny.

08:15.370 --> 08:18.497
Come here.
What's the problem?

08:18.582 --> 08:19.999
Get off the field, Dad.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.709
Why can't you hold
on to the football?

08:21.793 --> 08:23.794
What's so God damn hard
about holding on to it?

08:23.879 --> 08:24.837
I'm sorry.

08:24.921 --> 08:27.131
All you gotta do is hold
the ball, and you can't.

08:27.215 --> 08:28.966
Tell me why
you can't do it.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.759
That's all I wanna know.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.136
I'll try better next time.
Come on.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.221
Charlie!

08:34.306 --> 08:36.056
Don't you walk away from me.

08:36.140 --> 08:39.018
Don't you walk away from
me when I'm talking to you.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.477
Tell me why
you can't do it.

08:40.562 --> 08:41.562
Enough.

08:41.645 --> 08:42.770
Tell me.
Answer a question.

08:42.856 --> 08:43.981
Mr. Billingsley.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.733
It's the first
day of practice.

08:45.817 --> 08:47.860
This is practice. Seriously.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.528
Enough. Charlie!

08:49.779 --> 08:51.780
Embarrassing me out here.

08:51.907 --> 08:52.907
Jesus Christ.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.117
It's all right, Don.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.999
It's all right. Don't
worry about it. Here we go.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.209
Slot right. 38...

09:03.293 --> 09:06.212
Billingsley, you ain't gotta
worry about holding on to the ball.

09:06.338 --> 09:09.089
Why's that? 'Cause
you ain't gonna get it.

09:09.174 --> 09:11.133
Your job is to be
blocking for Boobie.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.469
I don't care if your
daddy is over there crying.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.262
You never shut up,
do you?

09:15.347 --> 09:18.599
Our team's been playing with
each other for a long time

09:18.683 --> 09:21.936
and we got the brotherhood
part of it down pretty much.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.731
People here at Permian
are already predicting

09:25.815 --> 09:27.358
a State Championship.

09:27.442 --> 09:29.401
Is there any pressure
to that for you guys?

09:29.486 --> 09:32.112
Any time they start predicting
the State Championships

09:32.197 --> 09:34.240
there's always pressure,
believe me.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.116
You guys don't
have a lot of size.

09:36.201 --> 09:37.743
How can you
make up for that?

09:37.827 --> 09:40.162
We're gonna
rely on our speed

09:41.206 --> 09:42.581
discipline.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.668
Come on, Ivory.
You're in the game now.

09:47.003 --> 09:50.089
Do football players get
special treatment here?

09:51.299 --> 09:55.261
What do you have to do to be a
better football player this year?

09:55.762 --> 09:57.638
Do you enjoy
playing football?

09:59.849 --> 10:02.851
You quit reading your
press clippings, all right?

10:02.936 --> 10:06.772
Because you're smaller, and
you're gonna be smaller everyweek.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.148
Yo, Boobie Miles!

10:08.233 --> 10:09.483
It is hard to be humble.

10:09.567 --> 10:12.695
Ain't gonna be no growth spurt
between now and the first game.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.655
Where does all that anger come from?

10:16.074 --> 10:18.826
They're gonna underestimate
you every single week.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.496
We teach you this
technique for a reason.

10:22.998 --> 10:25.374
We do not do this to
make our heads rattle.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.043
You're gonna
use your mind.

10:29.254 --> 10:32.089
You're gonna play with
your heart. Come on.

10:33.550 --> 10:36.719
That's what you're gonna use
to win the State Championship.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.182
Get up, Ivory.

10:50.442 --> 10:52.067
It's a good day, gentlemen.

10:52.152 --> 10:55.154
It's a good day to think
about responsibility.

10:55.405 --> 10:56.822
It's a good day
to ask yourself

10:56.906 --> 10:59.366
if on a personal level,
you're willing to accept that.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.618
If you're willing to
accept the responsibility

11:01.703 --> 11:03.329
that you have to
protect this team

11:03.413 --> 11:05.414
and this school
and this town.

11:06.124 --> 11:08.667
And make no mistake
about it, gentlemen

11:08.752 --> 11:11.837
we are in the business
of protecting this town.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.175
We're in
the business of winning.

11:16.259 --> 11:18.969
The expectations
couldn't be any higher.

11:19.179 --> 11:24.933
We will win State.

11:33.068 --> 11:34.777
Can you be perfect?

11:41.409 --> 11:42.701
Mojo!

11:46.498 --> 11:47.623
No, I'm all right.

11:47.707 --> 11:48.999
Come on, Mike.
Live a little.

11:49.084 --> 11:50.459
He's not going out,
either.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.128
Yeah, he is. Mike,
you're going out tonight.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.672
If I have anything to say about
it, you're gonna get laid, too.

11:55.757 --> 12:00.386
Billingsley! Billingsley,
party at Taylor's house, now!

12:00.470 --> 12:02.930
You better be there.
Gonna get wasted.

12:03.014 --> 12:04.431
Party at Taylor's.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.438
Isn't that guy, like, 35?

12:12.315 --> 12:15.609
Mike, here's your mom's food.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.403
How much?

12:17.487 --> 12:19.196
Don't worry about it.
It's on us.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.406
How's she doing?

12:20.490 --> 12:21.740
You never give me
free food, David.

12:21.825 --> 12:23.409
I just gave you free food.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.160
Yeah, I forgot about that.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.412
Say hi to your mom.

12:26.496 --> 12:27.621
Yes, sir.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.957
Stay out of jail,
Billingsley.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.417
You're not going home, Mike.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.085
I ain't going
out drunk fooling.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.379
How about I bring your mom
dinner so you can come out with us?

12:35.463 --> 12:37.631
Because we'll get laid,
get drunk

12:37.715 --> 12:41.135
and we'll win State, but
not tonight. All right?

12:44.514 --> 12:47.599
You been blessed, Mike,
because we got a runner.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.060
He's gonna make
us all look good.

12:50.186 --> 12:52.104
So I'm telling
you to lighten up.

12:52.188 --> 12:55.107
All you gotta do is exist in
those two seconds between snap

12:55.191 --> 12:57.109
and you giving
Boobie the ball.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.111
So lighten up, Mike.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.156
How you doing?
Hey, Brian.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.490
How's old
Gaines treating you?

13:03.575 --> 13:05.492
Got you boys in line?
Got y'all perfect?

13:05.577 --> 13:07.369
We getting there.
How's your mama?

13:07.454 --> 13:08.454
Fine, sir.

13:08.538 --> 13:11.623
You mind if we get a shot
real quick with the kid?

13:11.708 --> 13:13.709
Shot?
Yeah, little picture.

13:13.793 --> 13:14.918
Yeah, sure.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.587
All right.
Just take a picture.

13:16.671 --> 13:20.883
My baby girl and the next Texas
State Championship quarterback.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.136
Where's the damn camera?

13:24.554 --> 13:27.890
Winchell, remember every minute
of this. I'm telling you right now.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.766
You're 17,
but it goes fast.

13:29.851 --> 13:32.269
Don't sleep,
don't waste a second of it.

13:32.937 --> 13:35.314
'Cause before you
know it, it's done.

13:35.398 --> 13:36.899
Nothing but
babies and memories.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.901
You hear me?
Babies and memories.

13:38.985 --> 13:43.030
Smile, sweetheart. Give
us a smile. Say "Mojo."

13:45.074 --> 13:47.451
Why don't you hold on
to her for a little while?

13:47.535 --> 13:48.994
Baby-sit her for us
for a couple hours.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.704
We're gonna
go get a drink.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.539
We'll be back
in a little bit.

13:52.624 --> 13:53.749
I'm kidding with you.

13:53.833 --> 13:57.461
Come here, sweetie. Let's
go back over to Mama.

13:58.296 --> 13:59.630
Thank you.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.841
Bring it home.
Bring one of these home.

14:02.926 --> 14:04.801
Get you one of these.

14:04.886 --> 14:06.887
Christian,
get you one of these.

14:06.971 --> 14:09.056
Boys? Right here.

14:21.611 --> 14:25.405
Wanna go to that party?
Just for a little bit?

14:47.762 --> 14:51.306
What I saw was speed out there,
but where's the beef, Coach?

14:51.391 --> 14:52.975
I saw me
some small boys.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.059
They're small.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.310
I think we're gonna be okay.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.603
On defense?

14:56.688 --> 14:58.438
Yes, ma'am.
I firmly believe that.

14:58.523 --> 15:00.983
We got some backs.
We're about, what, 180?

15:10.827 --> 15:13.161
Hi, Mike.
I'm Melissa.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.580
I know who you are.

15:14.664 --> 15:15.747
You do?

15:15.832 --> 15:17.624
Everybody knows who you are.

15:17.709 --> 15:20.544
Everybody knows
who you are, Mike.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.254
Is that right?

15:22.338 --> 15:23.922
...lot of things:
Arab oil embargo...

15:24.007 --> 15:26.967
Oh, God.
Don't talk about that.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.760
Midland Lee likes to
bust it up the middle.

15:28.845 --> 15:29.886
You're right about that.

15:29.971 --> 15:31.138
You know what
you should do?

15:31.222 --> 15:33.265
You should play
Boobie Miles defense.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.725
Work him both ways.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.643
I don't want
to get him hurt.

15:36.728 --> 15:38.520
We need him to
score touchdowns.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.523
Bullshit. That big
nigger ain't gonna break.

15:41.733 --> 15:45.110
You wanna beat Midland Lee,
you play him middle linebacker.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.737
Break some
heads out there.

15:46.821 --> 15:49.406
Are you ready for
Midland Lee, Coach?

15:53.870 --> 15:55.370
This is not about Boobie.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.790
This is about the fact that we're
sitting here while they're up there.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.959
I wanna be
with a ball carrier.

16:01.044 --> 16:02.294
Baby, Boobie is...

16:02.378 --> 16:05.422
Don't you "Baby, Boobie" me. I
wanna see something. You gonna play?

16:05.506 --> 16:08.133
Can I get a touchdown?
How about that?

16:09.260 --> 16:10.802
Why don't you
have a girlfriend?

16:10.887 --> 16:12.387
I don't know.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.724
Why doesn't he
have a girlfriend?

16:18.561 --> 16:20.729
Is that a rule or something?

16:22.106 --> 16:23.857
No, not really.

16:24.192 --> 16:27.069
Well, then why don't
you have a girlfriend?

16:27.153 --> 16:28.570
Just don't.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.113
Are you gay?

16:30.198 --> 16:31.990
What?
Is he gay?

16:33.242 --> 16:34.701
I'm not gay.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.454
Can you prove it?

16:38.498 --> 16:42.501
Coach, here's to the start of your
second season as our head coach.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.836
We're here. We believe
in you and Sharon.

16:44.921 --> 16:46.129
Thank you.

16:46.214 --> 16:50.175
And to sitting here in December
as the state champions of Texas.

16:50.385 --> 16:51.677
Let's bring them hell.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.261
Go, Mojo!

16:54.013 --> 16:55.097
Go get them.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.223
Bring in
some glory, Coach.

17:06.401 --> 17:09.194
Why isn't anyone
allowed at your house?

17:10.863 --> 17:12.239
People come over.

17:13.616 --> 17:14.782
When?

17:16.536 --> 17:18.662
Is your mother really crazy?

17:20.205 --> 17:21.248
No.

17:22.250 --> 17:23.791
Are you crazy?

17:26.628 --> 17:27.878
Do I look crazy?

17:27.964 --> 17:31.049
You look like someone who'll
get out of Odessa, Texas one day

17:31.134 --> 17:32.634
and never look back.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.970
Seriously works for me.

17:45.314 --> 17:46.565
See you.

17:58.161 --> 17:59.828
Get in here, boy.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.456
Come on. Get this off.

18:21.017 --> 18:22.851
Don't be getting so prudish.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.770
Stop. We're on your couch.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.855
Something for everybody.

18:30.026 --> 18:31.943
Let's go to your room.

18:32.028 --> 18:34.029
Let's go to your bedroom.

18:34.655 --> 18:36.823
Dad, can you just go
back to bed, please?

18:36.908 --> 18:39.284
Who's this? This Melissa?

18:39.660 --> 18:41.536
Yes.
Maria.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.663
How you doing, Maria?

18:44.707 --> 18:46.541
Damn, girl.
You have grown up.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.419
Dad, please. Can you
just go back to bed?

18:52.298 --> 18:54.299
What happened to my lamp?

18:54.550 --> 18:56.802
Hey, y'all.
What's going on?

18:57.053 --> 18:58.887
Hey, Flippy.
Hi, Maria.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.889
What happened to my lamp?

19:00.973 --> 19:02.015
I dropped it.

19:02.642 --> 19:03.975
Yeah, you dropped it.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.977
That makes perfect sense. He dropped it.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.814
Can't hold on to the lamp,
can't hold on to the football.

19:08.898 --> 19:12.901
I can hold on to the football,
Dad. Now get the hell out of here!

19:16.280 --> 19:17.781
Little fumble.

19:18.241 --> 19:20.158
Can't hold on
to the football.

19:20.243 --> 19:22.828
Since when can
you hold on to it?

19:22.912 --> 19:25.705
I haven't seen it.
You hold on to it today?

19:25.790 --> 19:27.833
Yesterday? You hold on
to the football yesterday?

19:27.917 --> 19:30.502
You seen him hold on to the
football? How about tomorrow?

19:30.586 --> 19:31.753
You gonna hold
on to it tomorrow?

19:31.838 --> 19:34.422
How about now?
Hold on to the football.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.549
God damn it, Dad.

19:35.633 --> 19:37.592
- Dad.
- What are you doing?

19:38.219 --> 19:39.845
Maybe this will help.
Dad!

19:39.929 --> 19:41.263
What are you doing?

19:41.347 --> 19:43.723
Hold on to the football!

19:43.808 --> 19:46.893
Dad! God damn it,
Dad! Knock it off!

19:56.112 --> 19:58.864
I don't think we've felt this
kind of expectation in years.

19:58.948 --> 20:01.283
If Winchell shows up
like we know he can

20:01.367 --> 20:06.037
even a short passing game to give
Miles a few feet of cushion...

20:20.303 --> 20:22.053
You boys all right?

20:22.763 --> 20:24.014
Yes, sir.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.351
Gonna win State?

20:28.477 --> 20:30.061
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

20:30.146 --> 20:31.563
Undefeated?

20:32.690 --> 20:34.649
Yes, sir.
Get it done.

20:46.037 --> 20:49.247
"The Southern California
lifestyle

20:49.332 --> 20:52.167
"is but one of
the bonus features

20:53.544 --> 20:55.503
"of playing for..."

20:56.130 --> 20:57.339
What's that word?

20:57.423 --> 20:58.757
"Distinguished."

20:58.841 --> 21:00.425
Who's that one from, UCLA?

21:00.509 --> 21:02.260
No, this is USC.

21:02.345 --> 21:04.304
That's UCLA right there.

21:05.181 --> 21:06.431
Hey, Mike.

21:06.515 --> 21:09.643
You gonna come visit my
distinguished ass in California?

21:09.727 --> 21:12.604
See if I can put the
damn smile on your face.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.773
You know I'm fitting to be rich, right?

21:14.857 --> 21:17.359
I'm thinking about
hiring Eddie Murphy

21:17.443 --> 21:21.571
to lay some of his shit on you
till you crack a damn smile.

21:22.740 --> 21:25.241
No? Well, what about Richard Pryor?

21:25.952 --> 21:28.662
Bill Cosby?
I know you like Bill Cosby.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.580
Mike Winchell

21:30.665 --> 21:34.501
you got a natural ability
for throwing Boobie Miles the ball.

21:35.127 --> 21:38.630
And every once in a while,
you throw a pretty good pass

21:38.714 --> 21:41.841
so you're going to eat
your Jell-O Pudding Pops.

21:44.887 --> 21:46.680
Yo, Mike Winchell

21:46.889 --> 21:50.350
you gonna move out of
Odessa, Texas one day, baby

21:50.434 --> 21:53.561
and you gonna come visit
Boobie Miles in California

21:53.646 --> 21:55.522
and you gonna smile

21:56.065 --> 22:00.276
or I'm gonna stick four
pudding pops up your white ass.

22:00.903 --> 22:04.197
My God! I got
Mike Winchell smiling.

22:04.281 --> 22:05.365
Look at this.

22:06.617 --> 22:08.743
Did y'all see it?

22:09.578 --> 22:13.832
That's probably the only smile
y'all gonna see from Mike all season.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.125
Yeah.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.336
I'm distinguished now.

22:18.421 --> 22:20.380
- Hey, Boobie.
- What?

22:21.549 --> 22:23.174
You didn't lift.

22:23.592 --> 22:25.927
Come on, man.
This is God-given.

22:26.721 --> 22:29.014
Only thing I gotta
do is just show up.

22:31.434 --> 22:35.937
Now, people call this monument
out here, the Ratliff Stadium

22:36.022 --> 22:38.523
the monument to
football of Cdessa.

22:40.401 --> 22:43.695
They say some of that money
should have gone to the school.

22:43.779 --> 22:46.865
What's your feelings on
that, D.U.? You played ball.

22:46.949 --> 22:49.242
Ain't that stadium part of the school?

22:49.326 --> 22:51.619
So I say that money
did go to the school.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.329
What's everybody whining about?

22:53.414 --> 22:57.208
This is football country, folks.
Come on, get your heads out.

22:57.835 --> 23:00.003
Hi, Don.
Hey, Karen.

23:00.087 --> 23:01.713
It's you.
Do you like it?

23:01.797 --> 23:03.048
Think so. What is it?

23:03.132 --> 23:04.799
Rice Krispies.
You like it, right?

23:04.884 --> 23:06.301
Yeah, I love it.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.344
Thanks.
You're welcome.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.265
Hey, Gary.

23:12.349 --> 23:13.808
Hey, John.
How you doing?

23:13.893 --> 23:16.686
Good. You real busy?

23:16.771 --> 23:18.897
I got a minute or two. What you got up?

23:18.981 --> 23:21.357
I got some
characters out here.

23:21.442 --> 23:22.734
Who you got with you?

23:22.818 --> 23:24.778
Wilkins.
Hey, Gary.

23:25.488 --> 23:26.738
How you doing?

23:26.822 --> 23:28.823
How's that pretty wife
of yours? She's good.

23:28.908 --> 23:29.908
Ready for Friday night?

23:29.992 --> 23:31.743
Sure hope so.
Seems pretty good.

23:31.827 --> 23:34.079
I feel pretty good about it.
Really.

23:34.163 --> 23:36.247
We just wanted to
come by and visit

23:36.332 --> 23:39.125
maybe talk about defense a
little bit, if you got a second.

23:39.210 --> 23:40.919
You got a second?

23:41.003 --> 23:43.254
We got a dog named Mojo.

23:43.339 --> 23:44.881
We got a cat named Panther.

23:44.965 --> 23:46.424
You got season tickets?

23:46.509 --> 23:49.552
You kidding? We don't miss anything.
We go to all the scrimmages.

23:49.637 --> 23:51.012
Instead of
the cover two zone...

23:51.097 --> 23:54.766
Get the D line in as many
gaps and stack gaps as possible.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.893
Double dent,
type of technique.

23:56.977 --> 23:59.187
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, Boobie.

23:59.897 --> 24:01.064
How you doing?

24:01.148 --> 24:02.190
All right.

24:03.359 --> 24:05.985
Strong "B" slide force.
Hell, we can look at...

24:06.070 --> 24:07.779
Yeah. He'll still be a robber...

24:07.863 --> 24:09.531
Get Ivory out of the board.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.826
And go.
Go.

24:12.910 --> 24:16.287
Go by the speed and make
up for the size differential.

24:16.372 --> 24:18.248
What do you think, Coach?

24:23.170 --> 24:26.631
Now, obviously we're not Division I

24:27.675 --> 24:29.551
but we've got
a good program.

24:29.635 --> 24:33.555
You play well enough, we'll find
you a spot at Kansas Wesleyan.

24:34.223 --> 24:35.640
How far is the drive?

24:35.724 --> 24:37.058
What drive?

24:38.269 --> 24:41.855
To your school. How far is
it from Odessa to your school?

24:41.939 --> 24:43.148
I don't know.
10 or 12 hours.

24:43.232 --> 24:44.649
Are you offering?

24:44.900 --> 24:47.152
Ma'am?
Right now. Are you offering?

24:47.236 --> 24:48.653
If you are, we're in.
Mom.

24:48.737 --> 24:50.488
He'll sign his
intent right now.

24:50.573 --> 24:53.241
Well, obviously we're
interested, Miss Winchell.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.285
Otherwise we wouldn't be here,
Mike.

24:55.369 --> 24:58.079
But right now, that's all we are, is...

24:58.497 --> 24:59.581
Interested.

25:00.457 --> 25:02.834
Now, you go get at them,
you throw some touchdowns

25:02.918 --> 25:06.588
you win some football games,
maybe a State Championship

25:06.881 --> 25:10.258
we'll see if we can't find
you a home at Kansas Wesleyan.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.634
Yes, sir.

25:11.719 --> 25:13.845
Do you like playing football,
Mike?

25:13.929 --> 25:15.180
Yes, sir.

25:15.264 --> 25:16.931
Is it fun for you?

25:19.226 --> 25:20.518
Lots of fun, sir.

25:20.603 --> 25:22.020
He loves the game.

25:22.104 --> 25:23.771
That's good. It's important.

25:23.856 --> 25:25.231
It's legitimate
love of the game.

25:25.316 --> 25:29.944
Supposed to be fun, you know?
Greatest game in the world.

25:34.575 --> 25:38.203
I'm not that good at toasting,
but I'll give it a try.

25:38.287 --> 25:41.456
Fact is, I don't know if I've
ever done a toast myself before.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.833
Been involved
in a few, but...

25:44.793 --> 25:47.420
Here's to Boobie Miles,
who...

25:47.963 --> 25:51.382
Well, everything you get
this year, you deserve it

25:51.467 --> 25:55.637
because you work hard,
and I'm real proud of you.

25:56.805 --> 25:58.765
And L.V., to you.

25:58.849 --> 26:00.767
I can't even tell you
how proud of you I am

26:00.851 --> 26:03.853
the way you've raised this
kid and what you do for him.

26:03.938 --> 26:08.524
Here's to a great
season, and God bless us.

26:09.235 --> 26:10.235
God bless us.

26:10.319 --> 26:11.361
God bless.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.717
We been thinking about
this for four months now.

27:16.135 --> 27:19.512
You seniors have been
thinking about it for 17 years.

27:20.222 --> 27:23.057
Well, it's here now.
It's time.

27:24.310 --> 27:27.270
If any of you have
any doubt in your mind

27:28.063 --> 27:31.024
I don't want you to walk
through that door over there.

27:31.108 --> 27:33.443
You shouldn't have
any doubt in your mind

27:33.527 --> 27:35.903
about what you're
supposed to do tonight

27:37.573 --> 27:40.283
and about how
you're supposed to do it.

27:45.456 --> 27:46.789
So let's take care of it!

27:58.761 --> 28:00.094
Way to go.

28:02.306 --> 28:03.765
Boobie Miles.

28:04.308 --> 28:05.308
Did you see that?

28:08.270 --> 28:10.021
You can't turn it
back to Boobie Miles!

28:10.105 --> 28:12.398
All Boobie,
all the time here.

28:13.275 --> 28:15.193
A Mojo first down.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.697
Boobie around one more!

28:19.782 --> 28:20.948
Yeah! That's my boy!

28:21.033 --> 28:23.117
Boobie Miles
from 45 yards out

28:23.744 --> 28:25.870
scores a Mojo touchdown.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.538
Billingsley takes it right.

28:27.623 --> 28:28.915
Boobie. Here we go again.

28:28.999 --> 28:31.793
Into the end zone.
Touchdown, Mojo.

28:33.545 --> 28:36.047
Boobie Miles has it all,
all in one great package

28:36.131 --> 28:39.092
the speed, the size,
the athleticism.

28:39.176 --> 28:42.720
Let me tell you, folks, Boobie Miles
is worth the price of admission.

28:42.805 --> 28:44.180
Yeah!
Yeah, all right!

28:44.264 --> 28:46.682
Miles breaking
loose one more time.

28:46.767 --> 28:47.892
Yes, sir!

28:49.103 --> 28:50.561
Broke the line.

28:50.646 --> 28:51.854
Chavez!

28:53.649 --> 28:56.442
Chavez is playing
like a man possessed.

29:00.280 --> 29:01.906
God damn,
I'm so proud of you!

29:01.990 --> 29:03.741
Calm down, son.

29:03.826 --> 29:04.992
Chavez will eat you...

29:05.077 --> 29:06.244
Billingsley.

29:07.079 --> 29:10.081
Go sit on the bench.
Go get on the bench.

29:10.165 --> 29:11.374
Crazy.

29:12.668 --> 29:14.836
I like enthusiasm,
but my goodness.

29:18.757 --> 29:21.175
He's gonna throw it. What an arm!

29:21.260 --> 29:22.343
Did you see...

29:25.681 --> 29:30.351
Boobie Miles, from 35 yards
out, scores a Mojo touchdown.

29:31.353 --> 29:33.479
You're doing a great job.
Give me a smile.

29:33.564 --> 29:34.689
Thank you, Coach.

29:34.773 --> 29:37.483
Boobie Miles is about as
solid as you can ask for.

29:37.568 --> 29:38.609
He ain't gonna smile.

29:38.694 --> 29:40.194
Why not?
Why didn't he ever smile?

29:40.279 --> 29:41.737
He's more internal.

29:43.031 --> 29:44.699
Let me kick
that extra point.

29:44.783 --> 29:47.118
Not this time.
You did enough.

29:49.288 --> 29:50.621
Come on.

29:50.706 --> 29:52.498
Chris Comer,
you're going in.

29:52.583 --> 29:54.959
Comer, you're in the game.
Come on.

29:56.170 --> 29:59.130
Hey, son, come here. Where you going?

29:59.214 --> 30:00.506
You don't want
me to go in, Coach?

30:00.591 --> 30:01.883
You don't want a helmet?

30:01.967 --> 30:03.634
Where's your helmet?
Go get it.

30:03.719 --> 30:04.886
Yes, sir.

30:05.596 --> 30:06.762
You see my helmet, man?

30:06.847 --> 30:07.930
Find your helmet, son.

30:08.015 --> 30:09.390
What you looking for,
Water Bug?

30:09.433 --> 30:11.309
Hey, let me get this real quick. No way.

30:11.393 --> 30:12.602
Come on.

30:12.686 --> 30:14.187
My goodness gracious.

30:14.271 --> 30:15.313
Boobie.

30:15.397 --> 30:17.732
Water Bug, you can't come
out here with no helmet.

30:17.816 --> 30:21.360
You seen my helmet right
here? I can still go in.

30:21.445 --> 30:22.945
28 sweep.

30:23.030 --> 30:26.157
You don't know where your
helmet is! What are you thinking?

30:26.241 --> 30:27.325
Where did you
put your helmet?

30:27.409 --> 30:28.451
Right there.

30:28.535 --> 30:29.994
Well, it ain't there!

30:30.078 --> 30:33.039
Do you not know that you play
the game with a helmet on?

30:33.123 --> 30:34.832
Sit your tail
down right now!

30:36.210 --> 30:38.169
He throws back to Miles.

30:38.879 --> 30:40.838
Miles cuts to his right.

30:43.550 --> 30:45.426
Bailey takes him down.

30:55.270 --> 30:56.312
Was that a knee?

30:56.396 --> 30:57.563
Could have been.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.524
Hold on. Hang on.

31:11.078 --> 31:12.286
Winchell
was still in there.

31:12.371 --> 31:13.955
Billingsley
was still in there.

31:14.039 --> 31:15.581
Unfortunately

31:16.583 --> 31:19.001
the running back
has been taken down hard

31:19.086 --> 31:21.546
and it looks like
a knee could possibly...

31:21.630 --> 31:23.589
Just gonna touch
the kneecap here.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.927
Does it hurt over here on this side?

31:32.099 --> 31:33.641
Get up, Boobie.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.525
Let me
take a look at this.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.628
It's definitely his ACL.

32:02.713 --> 32:04.422
I mean,
it's a legitimate tear.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.592
Do you think
he tore any cartilage?

32:07.676 --> 32:10.344
Maybe. I could feel the knee catching.

32:13.181 --> 32:14.849
What do you think?

32:15.267 --> 32:18.477
This kid, it's all about
how he responds mentally.

32:18.979 --> 32:20.438
I don't know.

32:39.249 --> 32:41.584
All right, everybody.
Listen up.

32:43.045 --> 32:44.795
He's gonna be fine.

32:45.005 --> 32:47.381
It's not serious.
There's no tear.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.175
He'll be back in a week.

32:49.259 --> 32:51.093
That's the good news.

32:51.553 --> 32:54.513
Even better news, y'all played
a great football game tonight.

32:54.598 --> 32:56.682
A real good
football game.

32:57.684 --> 32:59.560
I'm real proud of you.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.229
And Mike...
Where's Mike Winchell?

33:02.314 --> 33:04.482
Mike, I'm proud of you, son.

33:04.858 --> 33:07.777
You showed discipline.
You showed leadership.

33:08.695 --> 33:09.945
You played your butt off,
son.

33:10.030 --> 33:11.447
I'm proud of you.

33:11.531 --> 33:13.407
All of you.
Proud of all of you.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.576
And, Wilson,
now that's body tackle.

33:15.661 --> 33:17.453
That's what I been
telling you about.

33:17.537 --> 33:19.580
Did y'all see him tonight?

33:20.749 --> 33:22.667
Anyway, I'm proud
of every one of you.

33:22.751 --> 33:26.003
I'm proud of the coaches, all
of y'all each and every player.

33:26.088 --> 33:27.713
I want you
to go celebrate.

33:27.798 --> 33:31.008
Feel good about yourselves
tonight, okay? Come on!

33:48.610 --> 33:50.778
We only got a minute and
a half left in the game.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.363
We're leading
by a good lead.

33:52.447 --> 33:55.533
He leaves the boy in there
like that. That makes no sense.

33:55.617 --> 33:57.535
You gotta protect
your best asset.

33:57.619 --> 33:59.120
What's the matter with this man?

33:59.204 --> 34:01.372
He could've ruined the whole
season for us right there.

34:01.456 --> 34:03.082
We were
up. We were winning big,

34:03.166 --> 34:04.375
and the boy
stays in the game.

34:04.459 --> 34:06.752
Yeah.
You don't need any more.

34:06.837 --> 34:08.462
You don't need to
accomplish any more.

34:08.547 --> 34:13.092
I think Coach
Gaines is a stupid idiot.

34:13.176 --> 34:15.719
Well, he shouldn't have put him in.

34:15.804 --> 34:17.929
I mean, we had a big
lead and everything.

34:18.014 --> 34:20.224
I don't understand
what that was all about.

34:20.308 --> 34:21.809
We can't do anything without Boobie.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.436
We had the game won.

34:23.520 --> 34:26.605
I'm feeling some damage
on the right side here.

34:26.982 --> 34:29.400
Well, can I play on Friday?

34:29.484 --> 34:30.735
I think
you got a slight tear.

34:30.819 --> 34:31.777
Can he play?

34:31.862 --> 34:33.487
Yeah, can I play?

34:33.989 --> 34:35.822
Can he play football?

34:36.449 --> 34:37.658
Can I?

34:39.453 --> 34:42.788
You need to get up
to Midland, get an MRI.

34:45.041 --> 34:47.333
Can a MRI fix your knee?

34:47.918 --> 34:50.420
Is he the one player
you can't do without?

34:50.630 --> 34:52.590
Well, I never looked at it that way.

34:52.674 --> 34:55.717
A football team is not about
one player or two players.

34:55.802 --> 34:57.762
A football team
is about the team.

34:57.846 --> 35:00.848
This is a unit, and that's
the way we have to play.

35:01.767 --> 35:04.351
It's gonna be a challenge.

35:14.696 --> 35:16.864
You are making
some bad decisions!

35:18.867 --> 35:20.785
You're playing like
the village idiot.

35:20.869 --> 35:23.954
You want people to think
you're the village idiot?

35:37.052 --> 35:40.179
As the Eagles
take down the Panthers, 49-6

35:40.263 --> 35:41.639
and for Coach Gary Gaines

35:41.723 --> 35:43.474
play's gotta be back
to the drawing board.

35:43.558 --> 35:45.559
That's gonna be the word
around town all week.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.603
Coach Gaines,
what are you gonna do?

35:47.687 --> 35:51.315
The loss of Boobie Miles can not
result in the loss of this season.

36:07.749 --> 36:09.542
Hell of a game.

36:09.626 --> 36:10.960
Give me the keys.

36:11.461 --> 36:13.087
Way to take care of business.

36:13.213 --> 36:14.880
Give me the keys, Dad.

37:24.326 --> 37:25.701
We...

37:26.328 --> 37:29.622
We just need a few more
days, Coach, and we be back.

37:31.499 --> 37:33.500
You go into Midland,
get that MRI?

37:33.585 --> 37:35.085
I don't need nothing in Midland.

37:35.170 --> 37:37.087
Those rich hillbillies
ain't never seen nothing

37:37.172 --> 37:38.797
as pretty as
Boobie Miles' knee.

37:38.882 --> 37:41.342
Them MRI machines wouldn't
know what to do with it.

37:41.426 --> 37:43.969
He gonna be just fine,
Coach Gaines.

37:44.346 --> 37:45.804
We gonna go
back to the clinic

37:45.889 --> 37:48.182
but they already said
there ain't no tears.

37:50.143 --> 37:52.645
No tears?
Ain't no tear.

37:54.564 --> 37:55.814
Is that what they said?

37:55.899 --> 37:59.526
Yes, sir. We gonna go back
for some double confirmation

38:00.570 --> 38:04.740
but when it come time to play
Midland Lee, we be good to go.

38:07.077 --> 38:08.744
That's good then.

38:24.719 --> 38:27.221
He designed his
offense around one player.

38:27.639 --> 38:28.681
We're dead.

38:28.765 --> 38:30.140
We're not dead.

38:30.225 --> 38:32.643
We just need to start
throwing the football.

38:32.727 --> 38:33.894
We're dead.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.479
Dead. Pull it.

38:38.858 --> 38:40.609
We gotta lighten up.

38:41.486 --> 38:42.778
We're 17.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.322
Do you feel 17?

38:46.241 --> 38:47.908
I don't feel 17.

38:48.952 --> 38:49.994
Pull it.

38:50.078 --> 38:51.745
We will win State.

38:52.330 --> 38:55.207
Chavo, you're like a human piñata.

38:55.291 --> 38:57.501
You get your ass all beat
on more than anybody I know

38:57.585 --> 38:59.503
and you just sit there
and spit out candy.

38:59.587 --> 39:02.297
That's 'cause he's out
of here. He's got the grades.

39:02.382 --> 39:05.300
No matter what, if we win or
lose, he knows he's getting out.

39:05.385 --> 39:08.220
He's like the one-foot-
out- the-door man.

39:08.763 --> 39:10.180
You're gonna
be drinking martinis...

39:10.265 --> 39:11.306
Give me the gun.

39:11.391 --> 39:13.976
Eating lamb chops.
Getting manicures.

39:14.060 --> 39:15.602
You're just jealous.

39:15.770 --> 39:17.604
Removing
your freaking shoes?

39:28.533 --> 39:30.451
What's it like being the quarterback?

39:30.535 --> 39:33.829
I mean, this is a big
responsibility for a 17-year-old kid.

39:34.539 --> 39:36.582
No! That is not acceptable!

39:38.126 --> 39:40.085
It's sort of, I mean...

39:41.504 --> 39:43.464
It's not too bad, I know.

39:45.216 --> 39:46.884
You are playing like a fool.

39:46.968 --> 39:48.135
Do you think you can handle it?

39:48.219 --> 39:50.220
If you got a receiver
getting jammed inside

39:50.305 --> 39:51.805
what will you do
with your brain?

39:51.890 --> 39:53.057
Yeah, hope so.

39:53.141 --> 39:54.725
What will your brain do?

39:54.809 --> 39:56.477
You'll throw outside!
Throw it outside.

39:56.561 --> 39:57.686
You'll throw outside!

39:57.812 --> 39:59.605
Now you think you can do that? Yes, sir.

39:59.689 --> 40:01.398
Well, show me.

40:09.491 --> 40:11.075
Hey.

40:12.452 --> 40:14.870
I thought maybe
if you came home,

40:14.954 --> 40:16.872
it would help
out a little bit.

40:18.041 --> 40:20.626
She's sick.
She's not doing so good.

40:22.462 --> 40:26.298
It's just kind of hard. Football's
starting and this is a lot.

40:27.175 --> 40:30.761
I thought if maybe you could
come home, it'd help out a little

40:30.845 --> 40:33.180
because she's
your mother, too.

40:39.354 --> 40:40.479
Okay.

40:54.327 --> 40:56.620
Can you get
the job done, Mike?

41:00.792 --> 41:02.543
We're pretty small.

41:03.211 --> 41:06.046
I didn't ask you if
you think we're small.

41:07.549 --> 41:10.759
I asked you if you think
we can get the job done.

41:12.178 --> 41:13.470
I think so.

41:13.555 --> 41:17.349
You're gonna have to do better than
"I think so." Is that clear?

41:18.059 --> 41:19.476
It's clear.

41:20.895 --> 41:23.063
Now I'm gonna
assume that by now

41:23.148 --> 41:25.107
you've learned that
the world's not fair

41:25.191 --> 41:28.735
and sometimes you get the
short end. That's all you get.

41:29.112 --> 41:32.531
And if you don't do something
personally to fix it

41:33.658 --> 41:36.285
then that's all
you're ever gonna get.

41:37.579 --> 41:38.912
Yes, sir.

41:46.504 --> 41:47.754
Mike.

41:55.388 --> 41:57.014
Do you want to
play college ball?

41:57.098 --> 41:59.183
Do you want to
get out of this town?

42:02.353 --> 42:03.645
I think so.

42:05.815 --> 42:08.567
Why aren't you doing
something about it?

42:10.403 --> 42:12.154
My ma's not right.

42:26.836 --> 42:29.755
One of these days, you're gonna
have to get out of this house.

42:29.839 --> 42:32.132
You're gonna
have to leave her.

42:35.094 --> 42:36.386
Yes, sir.

42:36.512 --> 42:39.932
You got to accept the fact that
people have to take care of themselves

42:40.016 --> 42:42.935
and that includes you.
You understand that?

42:43.478 --> 42:44.770
Yes, sir.

42:45.230 --> 42:46.355
Okay.

42:47.607 --> 42:49.149
The truth is

42:49.609 --> 42:52.319
against some
pretty overwhelming odds

42:53.196 --> 42:56.323
if you do decide
to accept that...

42:58.034 --> 42:59.701
Look at me, Mike.

43:02.163 --> 43:04.456
If you decide
to accept that

43:07.502 --> 43:09.836
you're gonna
seriously fly, son.

43:20.932 --> 43:22.266
Same song, different verse.

43:22.350 --> 43:25.269
Middle of the second quarter,
Cooper has a 14-0 lead.

43:25.353 --> 43:27.854
Things are really
going south in a hurry.

43:28.690 --> 43:30.065
But when you
got an offense play

43:30.149 --> 43:32.234
built around one
player, that's great

43:32.318 --> 43:33.944
as long as
the player's there.

43:34.028 --> 43:36.071
When he gets hurt, in
this case like Boobie did,

43:36.155 --> 43:37.281
what do you do?

43:37.365 --> 43:40.117
I don't know, but Gaines
better come up with a plan quick

43:40.201 --> 43:41.743
'cause
the unthinkable will happen.

43:41.828 --> 43:45.455
The Panthers are gonna lose
two consecutive district games.

43:45.540 --> 43:47.374
Wilson gets the handoff

43:47.458 --> 43:49.459
and he's got room to run
on the left-hand side.

43:49.544 --> 43:52.796
Across the line.
Clotheslined by Gary Grubb.

43:52.880 --> 43:53.922
And he's down.

43:54.007 --> 43:56.174
Give me a running back!
We got a running back?

43:56.259 --> 43:58.635
Permian has lost Boobie
Miles, now Wilson...

43:58.720 --> 43:59.845
Comer! Yeah, come on!

43:59.929 --> 44:02.806
...leaving him with third-string
running back Chris Comer.

44:04.517 --> 44:06.643
Comer around
the right side

44:06.728 --> 44:09.438
has some room to run,
and runs out of bounds.

44:10.773 --> 44:11.982
What is that?

44:12.066 --> 44:13.275
I didn't have a block.

44:13.359 --> 44:15.360
You are so soft!
Are you scared?

44:15.445 --> 44:17.988
I didn't have no block.
Football is a contact sport!

44:18.072 --> 44:19.406
I think
he's a sophomore.

44:19.490 --> 44:22.951
...looking for a badminton scholarship
but that's not gonna cut it.

44:24.871 --> 44:26.371
Blue 40!

44:26.831 --> 44:29.916
The snap. Looking to
throw. Here comes the rush.

44:30.001 --> 44:32.961
Winchell avoids the
rush, throws the ball.

44:33.046 --> 44:35.172
Comer turns from
blocker to receiver

44:35.256 --> 44:37.966
has the ball,
crosses the 20-yard line

44:38.051 --> 44:39.551
crosses the 30.

44:39.635 --> 44:42.637
Comer to the 40!
Comer to the 50!

44:42.722 --> 44:44.639
Where did this
speed come from?

44:44.724 --> 44:45.849
Go!

44:46.768 --> 44:48.518
Who was that?
It was Comer.

44:48.603 --> 44:50.020
Our Comer?

44:50.104 --> 44:51.563
It was Comer.

44:51.647 --> 44:55.484
Comer
has a Mojo touchdown!

44:55.943 --> 44:58.779
Chris Comer with
his first varsity TD.

44:58.863 --> 44:59.863
Not letting
go of that ball.

44:59.947 --> 45:00.947
Give me the ball.

45:01.032 --> 45:05.369
85 yards, the second-longest
power play in Permian history.

45:05.453 --> 45:07.954
Interception, Brian Chavez!

45:09.874 --> 45:12.959
Abilene Cooper back
to punt. It's blocked!

45:13.628 --> 45:17.631
Touchdown, Permian!
That's a Mojo touchdown.

45:18.674 --> 45:19.883
Jesus!

45:19.967 --> 45:23.428
Billingsley up the middle, picks
up a great block from Comer.

45:23.513 --> 45:26.348
Forearm shiver,
in for the Mojo touchdown.

45:26.432 --> 45:28.475
There's
your old school football.

45:38.111 --> 45:39.611
Where did this
guy come from?

45:39.695 --> 45:42.322
Chris Comer has poured
on some fantastic runs

45:42.407 --> 45:44.324
and one fantastic pass reception

45:44.409 --> 45:46.660
leading Mojo
from a 14-nothing...

45:50.540 --> 45:51.581
Hello?

45:51.666 --> 45:53.083
I'm feeling great.
How are you?

45:53.167 --> 45:55.252
I feel much better than
I did before the hit.

45:55.336 --> 45:56.420
This team has a swagger.

45:56.504 --> 45:58.380
They're walking tall and playing tough.

45:58.464 --> 45:59.714
I love these kids.

45:59.799 --> 46:01.174
I love the way
Winchell is playing.

46:01.259 --> 46:03.969
They came together
after Boobie went out...

46:04.053 --> 46:06.680
He's got him.
Touchdown in the corner!

46:07.515 --> 46:09.433
You know, we just have to dig deep...

46:09.517 --> 46:11.852
Comer's amazing.
He's stepping in just nicely.

46:11.936 --> 46:15.147
My concern is that he doesn't have
the experience in the long run.

46:15.231 --> 46:18.567
If they can just stay
strong, not get overconfident

46:18.651 --> 46:21.736
and take out Midland Lee,
I think we're going, man.

46:21.821 --> 46:24.698
I think we're gonna go all the
way, but I'm a little worried.

46:24.782 --> 46:27.367
Oh, no, sir.
It's just a small sprain.

46:28.411 --> 46:29.619
It was just a precaution.

46:29.704 --> 46:30.787
We're on a roll.

46:30.872 --> 46:33.206
Don't get started on the
celebration dance just yet.

46:33.291 --> 46:34.958
We got Midland coming up.

46:35.042 --> 46:37.627
Midland Lee is the real deal.

46:37.712 --> 46:39.629
You don't need to be swaggering now.

46:39.714 --> 46:41.131
You got to be
playing and practicing.

46:41.215 --> 46:44.551
Permian zips
past North Shore Galena, 17-3.

46:44.635 --> 46:47.012
Come on, we're five and
one. The team is winning now.

46:47.096 --> 46:49.014
They're winning, but who we playing?

46:49.098 --> 46:51.099
I mean, come on, mediocre teams.

46:53.561 --> 46:56.938
Two losses could shut the
door on the Permian Panthers.

46:57.023 --> 47:00.066
Let's not start tooting our
horns just yet, you know what I mean?

47:00.151 --> 47:03.320
You lose two division games
in this football climate

47:03.404 --> 47:05.322
and you're done, Sammy.

47:12.497 --> 47:13.997
Midland.

47:14.081 --> 47:15.165
Boobie.

47:15.666 --> 47:18.668
This the best damn
hospital in Texas.

47:19.795 --> 47:21.922
The very best.

47:50.743 --> 47:52.786
My son, Andrew, played for Midland,

47:52.870 --> 47:54.913
and ended up
back East at Penn.

47:55.164 --> 47:57.415
He's playing
with Joe Paterno?

47:57.792 --> 48:00.293
University of Pennsylvania.
Premed.

48:00.586 --> 48:03.129
Just let it relax.
You have any pain?

48:03.381 --> 48:04.548
Not at all.

48:04.632 --> 48:06.424
Does this hurt?
No.

48:06.509 --> 48:08.093
None of that hurts?
Nope.

48:08.177 --> 48:11.388
Okay. Go ahead and sit up, and
just let your legs hang over.

48:11.472 --> 48:15.225
Go ahead and get dressed
and let me look at the scan.

48:15.309 --> 48:18.019
I'm sorry.
You're James' dad?

48:18.104 --> 48:19.396
No, I'm his uncle.

48:19.480 --> 48:21.731
Come over, and let me
look at the scan with you.

48:21.816 --> 48:24.150
This is the scan we just
did today of his knee.

48:24.235 --> 48:26.653
This is looking right
through the middle of the knee.

48:26.737 --> 48:30.532
What we're looking at right
through here is the ACL

48:30.616 --> 48:34.244
and what this shows is that
he's had a fairly significant,

48:34.328 --> 48:35.745
fairly serious injury.

48:35.830 --> 48:38.373
Let me show you. Right through
here is where the injury is

48:38.457 --> 48:40.834
and it looks like you've
had a pretty serious injury

48:40.918 --> 48:42.335
to that part of your knee

48:42.420 --> 48:44.504
significant enough
that I have concerns

48:44.589 --> 48:46.673
about what you
can do from here on.

48:46.757 --> 48:48.675
So when can I suit up?

48:50.261 --> 48:53.430
Let me just say, with how your
knee felt when I examined it

48:53.514 --> 48:55.932
and what I
see on the scan

48:56.017 --> 48:59.728
with the things that you do
well the reason that you're great

48:59.812 --> 49:01.771
is you can run and
cut and hammer people

49:01.856 --> 49:04.608
and you don't hesitate because
you've got a solid knee.

49:04.692 --> 49:06.109
When you don't
have this ligament

49:06.193 --> 49:08.445
you can't do that, so
it's out of the question.

49:08.529 --> 49:11.656
No. That's not what Dr. Spencer said.

49:11.741 --> 49:14.993
He said three weeks. Three weeks
is up, and I'm ready to play.

49:15.077 --> 49:17.537
I understand.
But again, when I...

49:17.622 --> 49:20.457
Based on what I see when I
feel and examine your knee,

49:20.541 --> 49:23.418
what I see here you really
can't play with this kind of...

49:23.502 --> 49:26.254
What are you talking about,
"I can't play"? I'm gonna play.

49:26.339 --> 49:30.216
I'm ready to play. My team
needs me. I'm ready to play.

49:30.301 --> 49:32.093
Listen to me.
I am listening to you.

49:32.178 --> 49:33.762
I want what's best for you.

49:33.846 --> 49:35.555
You and I are
on the same page...

49:35.640 --> 49:37.265
We ain't on the same page.

49:37.350 --> 49:39.434
How you gonna want what's
best for me? Hold on.

49:39.518 --> 49:43.730
How you gonna want what's best
for me? You from Midland, right?

49:44.690 --> 49:46.191
This is bull, man.

49:46.275 --> 49:48.151
You just jealous
'cause you from Midland.

49:48.235 --> 49:49.903
What I recommend...

49:49.987 --> 49:51.613
Who paying you?

49:52.573 --> 49:54.491
Come on, Boobie. That's okay.

49:54.575 --> 49:57.160
You trying to take
my football career!

49:57.244 --> 50:00.163
Boobie,
let's get out of here.

50:00.247 --> 50:03.750
Whatever you're saying
to me, listen to me.

50:03.834 --> 50:05.251
Who's paying you?

50:05.878 --> 50:09.172
Here back on Mojo Radio,
it's Slamming Sammy Stands.

50:09.256 --> 50:10.882
I knew tonight's
game was gonna be

50:10.966 --> 50:12.550
a big game,
but it just got bigger.

50:12.635 --> 50:14.511
Earlier today,
Cooper beat Woodland.

50:14.595 --> 50:17.263
If Permian wins tonight,
they're in the play-offs.

50:17.348 --> 50:21.351
If they lose, though, they fall back
into a three-way tie for first place

50:21.435 --> 50:25.271
and that means the
tie-breaker is a coin toss.

50:26.232 --> 50:28.358
So what did the doctor say?

50:34.281 --> 50:36.116
If you go out there before
your knee's ready...

50:36.200 --> 50:37.909
Coach, my knee's fine.

50:42.623 --> 50:44.624
You okay with this, L.V.?

50:45.251 --> 50:48.002
Yeah, I'm good with it.
100%.

50:51.132 --> 50:52.465
Go get dressed.

51:01.767 --> 51:04.352
The most storied rivalry
in the state of Texas

51:04.437 --> 51:08.314
is Permian hosting the Midland
Lee Rebels at Ratliff Stadium.

51:08.399 --> 51:09.983
Tonight one
of these teams

51:10.067 --> 51:12.527
could take a step
toward the play-offs.

51:12.611 --> 51:14.446
Permian has one
district loss,

51:14.530 --> 51:16.865
both Cooper and
Midland have two.

51:16.949 --> 51:18.241
There's no doubt about that.

51:18.325 --> 51:20.326
A win tonight puts
Permian in the play-offs

51:20.411 --> 51:22.078
no coin flip needed

51:22.163 --> 51:25.165
plus it will send the Lee
Rebels home for the season.

51:25.249 --> 51:27.250
Well, what do you know, folks.
Look at this.

51:27.334 --> 51:29.210
Coming out of
the locker room

51:29.295 --> 51:32.255
number 45 has emerged
from the locker room.

51:32.339 --> 51:34.507
Boobie doesn't look
like he's limping at all.

51:34.592 --> 51:36.926
He looks good to me. He
looks like he's ready to go.

51:37.011 --> 51:41.139
Now the question
is, decoy or player?

51:41.223 --> 51:42.432
He ain't gonna play.

51:42.516 --> 51:44.017
I don't think so either.

51:44.101 --> 51:46.311
From what I know about Coach Gary Gaines

51:46.395 --> 51:48.855
nobody holds his
cards closer than Gary.

51:49.315 --> 51:52.025
Come on, guys. Let's go.

51:54.695 --> 51:56.362
Winchell pitches to Comer.

51:56.447 --> 51:57.947
Flipped on his head!

51:58.032 --> 51:59.866
Winchell,
pressured by Olivera

51:59.950 --> 52:01.201
swings a pass out
to Billingsley.

52:01.285 --> 52:03.036
Picked off by Dominguez.

52:03.120 --> 52:06.289
Dominguez will take it
in from 25 yards away.

52:06.373 --> 52:08.541
And Lee breaks on top.

52:10.753 --> 52:12.754
Hang on to the ball, son!

52:12.838 --> 52:15.381
Don't worry about it.
Shake it off.

52:15.549 --> 52:19.302
Don't worry about it, Coach.
Let me spin.

52:20.513 --> 52:22.639
Y'all want to win,
put Boobie in.

52:22.723 --> 52:24.015
Set. Hut!

52:24.850 --> 52:26.476
Winchell will swing
it out to Billingsley.

52:26.560 --> 52:27.685
Come on, Donny.

52:27.770 --> 52:29.979
And the ball is
stripped by Dominguez.

52:30.064 --> 52:33.191
Kevin Lane, and a blatant
facemask by Billingsley.

52:33.359 --> 52:34.359
Dang!

52:35.861 --> 52:37.237
What's up?

52:40.449 --> 52:44.536
My goodness. Son, is there something
wrong with you? Are you mentally okay?

52:47.081 --> 52:50.250
What are you putting your helmet
on for? Take your helmet off, son.

52:50.334 --> 52:53.086
You're on the bench for a while.
You don't need that helmet.

52:53.170 --> 52:55.880
Third down with less than two
minutes to play in the half.

52:55.965 --> 53:00.009
Strandler over the left side,
uncontested. 32 yards down to TD.

53:00.094 --> 53:02.220
Permian came
in with a four-game win streak

53:02.304 --> 53:04.347
but they haven't
been tested all year.

53:04.431 --> 53:07.767
Coach Gaines has to find a
way to get his offense on track

53:07.852 --> 53:10.478
or start feeling his season
slipping through his fingers.

53:10.563 --> 53:16.276
Do you think
you're playing football?

53:16.360 --> 53:18.570
You are showing me nothing!

53:18.946 --> 53:20.655
Do you understand me?

53:20.781 --> 53:24.659
Do you think you got it made?

53:25.995 --> 53:28.496
Because if
that's what you think

53:28.581 --> 53:32.333
you're gonna find out what it
feels like to sit on your asses

53:32.418 --> 53:35.587
and watch Midland Lee
take your season!

53:42.136 --> 53:46.681
No offense tonight for Mojo, and
still no sign of Boobie Miles.

53:47.600 --> 53:50.935
Y'all want to win? Put
Boobie in. I'm about to spin.

53:51.437 --> 53:55.148
Come on, Coach. Let me get this for you.

53:55.900 --> 53:59.819
Under five minutes to play,
and Lee still leads 14-7.

54:00.654 --> 54:02.530
Weak defense, weak
offense and no Boobie.

54:02.615 --> 54:04.532
If you're Coach Gaines,
what do you do?

54:04.617 --> 54:07.535
Right now, Mike Winchell
can't get this offense going

54:07.620 --> 54:10.413
and the Midland coach has
seen Boobie on the sidelines.

54:10.497 --> 54:12.790
If you don't put him in,
he knows you're bluffing.

54:12.875 --> 54:14.417
I'd put him in.

54:14.668 --> 54:16.419
All right, move out!

54:29.683 --> 54:30.934
Come on!

54:36.315 --> 54:38.441
Boobie, you're in. Let's go.

54:38.525 --> 54:40.860
What you want?

54:47.368 --> 54:50.119
Well, we apparently are all
gonna get what we wished for

54:50.204 --> 54:51.788
because here
comes Boobie Miles

54:51.872 --> 54:54.248
and this is certainly
what the fans came to see.

54:54.333 --> 54:56.876
That's number 45 back
in the Permian backfield.

54:56.961 --> 54:58.336
Back slam,
37 stretch, on one.

54:58.420 --> 54:59.754
Break!

54:59.838 --> 55:01.756
Now it's gonna be
the senior, Number 45

55:01.840 --> 55:03.758
lining up behind
quarterback Mike Winchell

55:03.842 --> 55:07.470
that offensive line is
raring to go with room to run.

55:07.554 --> 55:09.931
Three, 12. Hut!

55:10.557 --> 55:13.935
Miles going left.
Hesitates just a bit.

55:14.645 --> 55:16.229
Get off me!

55:25.572 --> 55:27.240
Let's go with 60.

55:28.742 --> 55:29.993
Let's go.

55:31.245 --> 55:33.329
They're gonna cheat up to the line again

55:33.414 --> 55:35.498
see if they're gonna
run Boobie once more.

55:35.582 --> 55:36.708
He will go to the right.

55:36.792 --> 55:38.543
There is a hole.
He gets a block.

55:38.627 --> 55:42.422
The Dominguez brothers take him
down. He spins and he's down.

55:50.931 --> 55:52.849
Don't touch it.

55:52.933 --> 55:54.392
Try to relax.

55:54.935 --> 55:56.978
Let me take a look at it.

55:59.231 --> 56:02.275
I'm gonna get up on my
own. I can get up on my own.

56:02.860 --> 56:04.527
Folks,
the utter joy of watching

56:04.611 --> 56:06.404
Miles trot back
on to the field

56:06.488 --> 56:08.614
has been replaced
by the sheer misery

56:08.699 --> 56:10.825
of watching him
being carried off of it.

56:10.909 --> 56:14.037
We, unfortunately, may have
seen the last of Boobie Miles

56:14.121 --> 56:15.747
in the black and
white of Permian.

56:15.831 --> 56:18.374
Let me see. He's done.

56:18.459 --> 56:19.584
We're gonna go
jet fire, Coach.

56:19.668 --> 56:21.502
Well, you better go something!

56:21.587 --> 56:24.380
One minute, 35 seconds
left to play in this one.

56:24.465 --> 56:27.050
Panthers move immediately
to the hurry-up offense.

56:27.134 --> 56:28.593
Boobie no longer
a factor.

56:28.677 --> 56:31.387
Comer, following the tackle,
will dig up near midfield.

56:31.472 --> 56:33.514
The clock now
inside of 1:20.

56:33.599 --> 56:35.475
It'll be second down,
Permian.

56:36.351 --> 56:40.146
Lee clings to that seven-point
lead, and time becomes a factor.

56:40.230 --> 56:41.564
60, Cheetah.

56:41.648 --> 56:43.608
60, Cheetah! Hut!

56:44.943 --> 56:47.987
Again, Winchell to
Payne, beating Preston.

56:48.072 --> 56:49.489
Only 40 seconds left.

56:49.573 --> 56:52.408
Mike Winchell trying to keep
Permian's play-off hopes alive

56:52.493 --> 56:53.659
completes the pass!

56:53.744 --> 56:55.286
He's got it!

56:55.370 --> 56:57.747
Winchell was drilled,
but he seems to be okay.

56:57.831 --> 56:59.165
Back it off!

56:59.249 --> 57:03.044
Winchell has time, he's looking.
Again, Winchell to Payne.

57:03.170 --> 57:05.088
The clock
continues to run.

57:05.172 --> 57:07.173
25 seconds left.
Go!

57:14.389 --> 57:15.556
Go to the left.

57:17.518 --> 57:20.686
Let's go! Throw it up!

57:21.396 --> 57:23.147
Hold it! Hut!

57:24.608 --> 57:28.611
Mike Winchell trying to keep the
play-off hopes alive. Complete!

57:34.535 --> 57:37.495
This is for the ball game.
The clock is still moving.

57:40.749 --> 57:42.542
Come on, front line!

57:44.753 --> 57:46.921
Mike Winchell will
throw from the shotgun

57:47.005 --> 57:49.173
steps back and
he drops the ball!

57:49.466 --> 57:51.175
Picks it up,
steps into the pocket,

57:51.260 --> 57:52.969
looking for Allen Wyles.
He's open.

57:53.053 --> 57:56.222
Here's the pass,
and it's too tall!

57:56.557 --> 57:59.392
Midland Lee
wins the ball game.

58:45.314 --> 58:47.190
It's all right.
No, man.

58:47.274 --> 58:48.608
I'm sorry.

58:54.615 --> 58:58.034
Thanks for nothing,
Coach. Go home, cowards.

58:58.118 --> 59:01.412
I don't understand what's gonna
happen at this point. How do we...

59:01.496 --> 59:05.917
Another loss, and that's
thrown us into a three-way tie.

59:06.001 --> 59:08.377
They're going to
have a coin toss.

59:08.462 --> 59:09.879
You're serious?

59:09.963 --> 59:11.923
We're gonna get the
three coaches together.

59:12.007 --> 59:14.175
They're gonna
all toss a coin.

59:14.259 --> 59:17.178
That's 5-A's football tie-breaker
right now. What can I say?

59:17.262 --> 59:19.639
What the hell kind of way
is that to make a decision?

59:19.723 --> 59:22.892
When you assemble the kind
of talent that we have here

59:22.976 --> 59:24.894
and then you just
throw it away like that.

59:24.978 --> 59:28.189
It started with him playing
Boobie when we had a big lead.

59:28.273 --> 59:30.024
This is a once in
a lifetime thing

59:30.108 --> 59:32.109
to be able to
see these people.

59:32.194 --> 59:34.946
I mean, we could have
been in the history books.

59:35.030 --> 59:38.950
And now? Ain't no
way. I mean, that's it.

59:39.034 --> 59:41.244
What about
Winchell's play tonight?

59:41.328 --> 59:42.912
Well, what do you think?

59:42.996 --> 59:44.664
And Billingsley
couldn't hold on...

59:44.748 --> 59:46.374
They all suck!

59:46.458 --> 59:48.251
I think it's 'cause of the coaching.

59:48.377 --> 59:50.211
You know what
else it is, too?

59:50.295 --> 59:53.089
They been doing too much
learning in the schools.

59:56.093 --> 01:00:00.221
My daddy used to take a
bull whip, and he'd cut it up

01:00:01.807 --> 01:00:03.933
and he'd tie
13 knots in it.

01:00:05.644 --> 01:00:09.063
Then he'd beat me in my gut

01:00:11.066 --> 01:00:13.859
till I got a sick
feeling in my stomach.

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:16.028
Well.

01:00:17.572 --> 01:00:19.573
That's how I feel

01:00:19.658 --> 01:00:23.661
when I watch
you play football.

01:00:24.413 --> 01:00:26.205
Sick at my stomach.

01:00:26.707 --> 01:00:28.582
I need some fresh air.

01:00:30.294 --> 01:00:32.420
What the hell
are you doing?

01:00:35.882 --> 01:00:38.426
Get this sickness
out of my stomach.

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:39.719
Yeah.

01:00:39.928 --> 01:00:41.345
God damn it, Dad.

01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:44.432
You were sent down here
to learn how to play football

01:00:44.516 --> 01:00:46.142
and you haven't.

01:00:46.685 --> 01:00:48.185
You have not.

01:00:48.854 --> 01:00:52.898
And I got to take that
as a personal failure.

01:00:54.735 --> 01:00:57.611
Nobody in Mojo football
wants to win in a coin toss.

01:00:57.696 --> 01:00:58.946
But that's the way it is.

01:00:59.031 --> 01:01:00.823
That's the way
the tiebreaker is.

01:01:00.907 --> 01:01:02.491
Well, they ought to change that.

01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:04.327
They ought to
change coaches.

01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:06.704
Make a lot of
changes next year.

01:01:11.126 --> 01:01:13.419
I was supposed to
make a man of you.

01:01:15.172 --> 01:01:16.172
Shit.

01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:18.758
Do you know what that is?

01:01:19.426 --> 01:01:21.594
That's a State Championship.

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:24.764
I won a State Championship.

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:26.474
Just calm down, Dad.

01:01:28.435 --> 01:01:40.279
Can you touch that?

01:01:42.783 --> 01:01:44.116
Hell with it.

01:01:44.451 --> 01:01:46.285
What the hell
are you doing?

01:01:53.752 --> 01:01:55.461
You drunk bastard.

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:08.432
You ever feel cursed,
Coach?

01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:10.726
Like, no matter what, inside your heart

01:02:10.811 --> 01:02:12.728
you feel that
you're gonna lose.

01:02:12.813 --> 01:02:14.563
Like something's
hanging over you

01:02:14.648 --> 01:02:18.984
following you like a witch,
or a demon that just...

01:02:20.278 --> 01:02:22.113
Why you got to
be so messed up?

01:02:22.197 --> 01:02:23.697
You can'twin.

01:02:24.908 --> 01:02:26.826
I feel like
that all the time.

01:02:27.828 --> 01:02:29.829
Even when things
are going good.

01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:32.623
When we're winning,
it's there.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:35.459
And when we're losing,
it's there.

01:02:36.128 --> 01:02:38.003
What is wrong with you?

01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:42.842
It took me a long time to realize

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:49.723
that there ain't much difference
between winning and losing

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:52.351
except for how the
outside world treats you.

01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:57.314
But inside you, it's about
all the same. It really is.

01:03:00.861 --> 01:03:03.904
Fact of the matter is,
I believe

01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:08.367
that our only curses are the
ones that are self-imposed.

01:03:08.452 --> 01:03:10.202
You know what I'm saying?

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:13.873
We, all of us,
dig our own holes.

01:03:16.543 --> 01:03:17.751
God, Dad.

01:03:34.895 --> 01:03:36.770
What is wrong with you?

01:03:37.355 --> 01:03:39.356
What's wrong with you?

01:03:44.404 --> 01:03:47.490
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is truly unbelievable.

01:03:47.574 --> 01:03:49.950
A three-way tie
for first place.

01:03:50.035 --> 01:03:52.703
So, in less than an hour,
this truck stop

01:03:52.787 --> 01:03:55.247
which we're not allowed
to reveal the identity of

01:03:55.332 --> 01:03:58.083
will serve as
host for a coin toss

01:03:58.168 --> 01:04:01.128
that will send two of these
teams to the state play-offs

01:04:01.213 --> 01:04:03.672
and one of them
home empty-handed.

01:04:03.757 --> 01:04:07.927
Okay, Skip. We're on in three, two, one.

01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:10.304
Folks, we're here with
the three winning coaches.

01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:11.847
We've all
agreed on the rules.

01:04:11.932 --> 01:04:13.516
Two out of three here,
odd man out.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.184
If you got one tails,
they're out.

01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:16.810
If you got one heads,
they're out.

01:04:16.895 --> 01:04:19.480
It's a tough way after a
great season for the coaches

01:04:19.564 --> 01:04:21.190
but this is
the way it's gonna be.

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:23.734
So when I give the word,
we're gonna toss our coins

01:04:23.818 --> 01:04:26.695
and then the district's gonna
have its two representatives.

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:28.822
Now let's see the coins,
guys.

01:04:28.907 --> 01:04:32.868
Coach Doug McCutcheon from
Abilene Cooper's got... What is it?

01:04:32.953 --> 01:04:34.537
1922 silver dollar.

01:04:34.621 --> 01:04:36.080
'22 silver dollar. All right.

01:04:36.164 --> 01:04:41.043
And Coach Gary Gaines from
Permian, you got a '69 nickel.

01:04:41.628 --> 01:04:43.212
And from Midland Lee

01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:46.090
Coach Earl Miller's
got a basic U.S. quarter.

01:04:47.342 --> 01:04:49.134
Okay. Coaches ready?

01:04:49.803 --> 01:04:50.886
One.

01:04:50.971 --> 01:04:52.012
Ain't no curses.

01:04:52.806 --> 01:04:53.931
Two.

01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:58.435
Three. Toss them.

01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:06.735
Coins are down.

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:08.737
This one looks
like it's heads.

01:05:08.822 --> 01:05:11.448
Okay, that's heads
for Abilene Cooper.

01:05:14.369 --> 01:05:15.828
That's mine.

01:05:19.124 --> 01:05:20.499
It's heads.

01:05:21.501 --> 01:05:23.836
Okay, Midland Lee is also heads.

01:05:26.339 --> 01:05:28.674
Hey, we got a third one over here, Skip.

01:05:29.384 --> 01:05:31.093
Coach, that's you.

01:05:34.514 --> 01:05:36.140
Come on, Gaines.

01:05:41.688 --> 01:05:44.315
Don't touch that.
Just leave it alone.

01:05:49.571 --> 01:05:50.654
That's heads.

01:05:50.739 --> 01:05:51.739
Yup, that's heads, too.

01:05:51.823 --> 01:05:54.199
Permian is also heads. Man!

01:05:54.868 --> 01:05:56.243
Well, that figures.

01:05:56.328 --> 01:06:00.122
The way your teams played each
other it'd take more than one toss.

01:06:00.206 --> 01:06:01.874
Hang on a second.

01:06:02.417 --> 01:06:04.209
You know, this coin's pretty worn.

01:06:04.336 --> 01:06:06.128
Does this look
like heads to you?

01:06:06.212 --> 01:06:08.297
I can't tell the difference.
It might be tails.

01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:12.051
There might be some controversy
here regarding Cooper's coin.

01:06:18.183 --> 01:06:19.558
It's tails.

01:06:31.905 --> 01:06:34.365
So the good news is
that life continues

01:06:34.449 --> 01:06:37.159
for both Midland Lee
and Permian high schools.

01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:39.328
At least for another couple of weeks.

01:06:39.412 --> 01:06:40.788
That's the good news.

01:06:40.872 --> 01:06:42.373
The not-so-good news is

01:06:42.457 --> 01:06:44.333
that it looks
like all roads are

01:06:44.417 --> 01:06:46.460
eventually leading
to Dallas Carter.

01:06:46.544 --> 01:06:49.546
And what a monster of
a team Dallas Carter is.

01:06:49.631 --> 01:06:53.425
This Dallas Carter team appears
to be completely unstoppable.

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:55.469
The rumor is
they've got nine players

01:06:55.553 --> 01:06:58.138
that have already signed
Division I letters of intent.

01:06:58.223 --> 01:06:59.348
Damn, them boys big.

01:06:59.432 --> 01:07:03.143
They are a very good
football team, people.

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:42.558
I'll get that
car fixed today.

01:07:44.644 --> 01:07:45.769
Yeah.

01:07:52.193 --> 01:07:55.362
I don't want this to sound
like an apology or anything

01:07:55.947 --> 01:07:57.865
but I didn't mean
half the things I said...

01:07:57.949 --> 01:07:58.949
I know.

01:08:05.165 --> 01:08:08.709
You just...
You ain't getting it.

01:08:09.627 --> 01:08:11.420
You don't understand.

01:08:12.213 --> 01:08:15.048
This is the only thing
you're ever gonna have.

01:08:17.135 --> 01:08:19.511
Forever.
It carries you forever.

01:08:27.854 --> 01:08:30.939
It's an ugly fact of life.
Donny, hell.

01:08:33.276 --> 01:08:35.736
It's the only fact of life.

01:08:38.363 --> 01:08:40.282
You got one year

01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:43.827
one stinking year to make
yourself some memories, son.

01:08:44.578 --> 01:08:47.038
That's all.
It's gone after that.

01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:56.631
And I'll be damned
if you're not gonna miss it.

01:09:17.946 --> 01:09:19.196
No guts.

01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:10.831
What's up, Water Bug?

01:10:10.915 --> 01:10:12.499
What's up, Boobie?

01:10:40.653 --> 01:10:44.072
Water Bug. Play-offs
belong to you, baby.

01:10:44.157 --> 01:10:45.949
I'll make you proud.

01:10:51.039 --> 01:10:52.915
What y'all looking at?

01:10:55.126 --> 01:10:56.460
Play your ass off.

01:10:56.544 --> 01:10:59.296
Win State. Be perfect. All that shit.

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:07.930
This is a gift for you.

01:11:08.014 --> 01:11:09.640
It's gonna be
worth a lot of money.

01:11:11.059 --> 01:11:12.601
I bet it will.

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:21.360
You be perfect,
Preacher Man.

01:11:24.906 --> 01:11:26.281
What's up?

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:07.155
Now what we gonna do? I can't do
nothing else but play football.

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:08.490
Don't worry about that.

01:12:08.574 --> 01:12:10.075
I can't be
doing nothing else.

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:11.493
You'll be all right, son.

01:12:11.577 --> 01:12:14.413
I can't do nothing
else but play football.

01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:19.209
Why? We practiced
and we practiced.

01:12:20.086 --> 01:12:22.504
You told me we were
gonna go to the pros.

01:12:22.588 --> 01:12:25.340
What the hell am I
gonna do without my knee?

01:12:26.384 --> 01:12:29.928
You'll find somebody else.
Don't worry about it, son.

01:12:30.596 --> 01:12:33.807
No. I wanted to buy you a house.

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:49.364
They won't let me play, though.

01:12:54.954 --> 01:12:56.997
It's play-off time in Texas.

01:12:57.081 --> 01:13:00.125
And who cares if Permian
snuck in on a coin toss?

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:01.960
There's
been a lot of expectations

01:13:02.045 --> 01:13:04.087
for this
Permian football team.

01:13:04.172 --> 01:13:06.423
And you got to love
this play-off atmosphere.

01:13:06.507 --> 01:13:09.760
They call this the thinning of the
herd the survival of the fittest.

01:13:09.844 --> 01:13:12.721
Win, you go on. Lose,
you play basketball.

01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:14.264
Quarterback Mike Winchell.

01:13:14.348 --> 01:13:16.850
Drops back, pulls right,
throws long.

01:13:16.934 --> 01:13:18.602
Caught! Touchdown!

01:13:20.271 --> 01:13:22.230
The Panthers defeated
Dallas Jesuit to advance

01:13:22.315 --> 01:13:24.191
to the next round 16.

01:13:24.275 --> 01:13:27.027
Down south, the killing
machine that is Dallas Carter

01:13:27.111 --> 01:13:29.988
rolls over Lufkin to 16-0.

01:13:30.073 --> 01:13:33.075
They're going to the
20, to the 10, to the 5!

01:13:33.159 --> 01:13:37.412
It's Comer, folks, into the
end zone for a Mojo touchdown!

01:13:37.538 --> 01:13:40.582
Chris Comer, with another
sensational performance.

01:13:40.666 --> 01:13:43.210
Permian cruises past San
Angelo and into the quarter.

01:13:43.294 --> 01:13:44.586
Permian looked great tonight

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:47.506
but Dallas Carter is playing
on a whole different level.

01:13:51.052 --> 01:13:52.928
Interception, Brian Chavez.

01:13:53.054 --> 01:13:54.888
Great read of the play. Touchdown!

01:13:54.972 --> 01:13:56.515
45 yards out.

01:13:56.599 --> 01:13:59.518
Permian defeats Nimitz, 48-7.

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:03.105
Moving into the semi-finals
of the Texas 5-A play-offs.

01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:07.943
Carter, monster play, advancing
them to the state finals.

01:14:10.488 --> 01:14:14.449
Mike Winchell drops back,
throws a 50-yard bomb!

01:14:14.534 --> 01:14:16.159
It's gonna be
caught by Parker!

01:14:16.244 --> 01:14:19.704
Hits the pylon in the corner
of the end zone. Touchdown.

01:14:19.789 --> 01:14:23.250
That's it. Permian's
gonna battle Dallas Carter

01:14:23.334 --> 01:14:27.045
for the Texas Class
5- A State Championship.

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:35.011
What would it take for you
to come up to Texas Stadium?

01:14:35.096 --> 01:14:36.138
How about if
y'all come out here?

01:14:36.222 --> 01:14:38.598
Where?
Over at Ratliff Stadium?

01:14:38.683 --> 01:14:39.724
Yeah.

01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:43.270
I still think there'd be a problem
with our fans sitting with your fans.

01:14:43.354 --> 01:14:44.980
I don't see any problems.

01:14:45.064 --> 01:14:48.733
We can bring in extra police to
handle the crowd-control issues.

01:14:48.818 --> 01:14:52.696
Mr. McClary, perhaps you're not aware
but we have an all-black community.

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:55.740
Frankly, between our communities,
there are some issues.

01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:58.118
Wait a minute. What issues
are we talking about?

01:14:58.202 --> 01:15:01.997
I'm not gonna get into it at
this table. It's just different.

01:15:06.836 --> 01:15:09.254
How about if we went
with a neutral site?

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:12.883
Say, College Station, or San
Anton, somewhere like that.

01:15:14.385 --> 01:15:16.553
Or you know
what we could do

01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:18.763
is the Astrodome.

01:15:21.475 --> 01:15:22.851
Astrodome.

01:15:23.811 --> 01:15:24.895
I got no problem
with that.

01:15:24.979 --> 01:15:26.062
Good.

01:15:26.147 --> 01:15:27.689
Let's discuss officials.

01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:30.609
I think the simplest thing to
do is get a zebra crew out of

01:15:30.693 --> 01:15:33.028
some neutral place like
San Antonio, or something.

01:15:33.112 --> 01:15:35.947
Now are these zebras
gonna be white or black?

01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:39.326
Well, as far as I know,
zebras are white and black.

01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:40.827
What are we
talking about here?

01:15:40.912 --> 01:15:43.079
How many black stripes these zebras got?

01:15:43.164 --> 01:15:46.875
A zebra's got about the same amount
of black as he does white ones.

01:15:46.959 --> 01:15:49.836
How many black stripes
you think a zebra's got?

01:15:49.921 --> 01:15:52.923
It makes sense to hire a crew
as is. That's how we always do it.

01:15:53.007 --> 01:15:55.175
Don't make sense to me.
It makes sense to me.

01:15:55.259 --> 01:15:56.218
Not me.

01:15:56.302 --> 01:15:57.928
Not a whole lot does make sense to you.

01:15:58.012 --> 01:16:00.055
Yeah, there's a lot
that makes sense to me.

01:16:00.139 --> 01:16:02.307
So you think having an
all-black officiating crew

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:04.226
is gonna help
you win the game?

01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:05.977
Watch your mouth.

01:16:15.321 --> 01:16:18.156
Hey, Coach.
How you doing?

01:16:18.241 --> 01:16:20.200
Ben, how you doing?
All right, Coach. You?

01:16:20.284 --> 01:16:21.910
Pretty good.
Hi, Sharon.

01:16:21.994 --> 01:16:22.994
How you doing?

01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:25.330
We're just out getting
flowers for the ladies.

01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:26.998
Secretaries week.

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:29.000
Is that right?
I'll be dogged.

01:16:29.085 --> 01:16:31.920
I don't have a secretary, so
I don't have to worry about it.

01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:35.298
You win State, Coach,
we'll get you two secretaries.

01:16:35.508 --> 01:16:36.549
Everything all right?

01:16:36.634 --> 01:16:39.511
Yeah, everybody's gonna be just
fine. Everything's all right

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:43.515
as long as we get out there
and get what we need to get done

01:16:44.642 --> 01:16:46.643
and, you know, win State.

01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:50.188
Boy, I sure hope so.
Yeah, me, too.

01:16:50.314 --> 01:16:52.315
Yeah, I want it bad as y'all do.

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:53.775
Yes, sir.

01:16:53.859 --> 01:16:56.611
You know, Dallas Carter,
that's a tough team.

01:16:56.696 --> 01:16:58.613
Real tough team.
Yeah?

01:16:58.698 --> 01:17:01.032
We're a pretty
tough team, too.

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:02.409
Yeah, that's true.

01:17:02.493 --> 01:17:05.161
So, beat them.

01:17:09.875 --> 01:17:11.126
Or what?

01:17:12.378 --> 01:17:13.753
"Or what"?

01:17:14.422 --> 01:17:15.630
Or...

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:21.720
You know, that would be a
real bad deal for you, Gary.

01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:27.392
All right? Let's just get
out there and get it done.

01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:29.936
Get that
State Championship.

01:17:31.355 --> 01:17:33.356
Well, I sure
appreciate your support.

01:17:33.441 --> 01:17:35.233
We believe in you.
I'm glad you do.

01:17:35.318 --> 01:17:38.069
We're behind you, Coach.
See you, Sharon.

01:17:39.238 --> 01:17:41.072
Well, that was subtle.
Yeah.

01:17:42.074 --> 01:17:44.034
Are we gonna move again?

01:17:44.118 --> 01:17:46.119
It's possible.
No, baby.

01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:15.273
What do you
think about Alaska?

01:18:15.358 --> 01:18:16.483
What about Alaska?

01:18:16.567 --> 01:18:17.650
Well...

01:18:18.986 --> 01:18:20.695
I bet that they are
not nearly as serious

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:22.530
about their
football in Alaska.

01:18:22.615 --> 01:18:24.199
I think that's
a real nice idea.

01:18:24.283 --> 01:18:28.787
We should go to Alaska, stay
there for a couple of years. 20.

01:18:29.413 --> 01:18:32.123
It's just something
to think about, baby.

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:34.376
I think it'd be really nice.

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:37.796
Build us a nice little igloo.

01:18:40.132 --> 01:18:42.175
Baby, these boys are big.

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:45.470
Yeah, they are. Sure are.

01:19:17.169 --> 01:19:18.420
Did you sleep last night?

01:19:18.504 --> 01:19:20.088
Yes, sir, I did.

01:19:20.172 --> 01:19:22.507
We got a six hour ride,
so we can get you some more.

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:24.259
All right, Coach.

01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:32.475
Coach.

01:19:46.449 --> 01:19:48.074
You got room for one more?

01:19:48.159 --> 01:19:50.452
Absolutely. Hop on.

01:20:40.085 --> 01:20:41.878
Mojo has come to Houston.

01:20:41.962 --> 01:20:44.506
This is the Astrodome, the
eighth wonder of the world

01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:48.259
and today, it's going to be Odessa
Permian versus Dallas Carter.

01:20:48.594 --> 01:20:51.012
This is a moment these kids have
been looking for their whole life.

01:20:51.096 --> 01:20:52.764
They started
playing as 8-year-olds

01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:55.308
in the Pop Warner fields
of Odessa, or in Dallas.

01:20:55.392 --> 01:20:57.143
They've dreamed of
the State Championship

01:20:57.228 --> 01:20:58.728
laying in bed
late at night

01:20:58.812 --> 01:21:01.105
dreaming of their chance
to bring home the title

01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:04.317
for their town, for their team,
for their school.

01:21:04.401 --> 01:21:06.361
Folks, lock the doors,
turn up the radios,

01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:07.529
strap yourself in.

01:21:07.613 --> 01:21:09.739
We've got East Texas versus West Texas.

01:21:09.823 --> 01:21:12.242
We've got Texas high school
football at its finest.

01:21:12.326 --> 01:21:14.536
No doubt.
This crowd is jacked.

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:16.746
This is going to
be an all-out war.

01:22:10.718 --> 01:22:12.760
Welcome,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:22:13.679 --> 01:22:15.263
Welcome,
Dallas Carter fans...

01:22:15.347 --> 01:22:17.098
Permian,
the home team, in white.

01:22:17.182 --> 01:22:18.600
Carter, the visiting team, in red.

01:22:18.684 --> 01:22:19.642
...to the 1988...

01:22:19.727 --> 01:22:21.519
Let's shake hands.
Have a good ball game.

01:22:21.604 --> 01:22:22.604
Texas 5-A...

01:22:22.688 --> 01:22:24.814
I'm gonna ring your bell
all day long, Mexican.

01:22:24.898 --> 01:22:25.982
...football championship.

01:22:26.066 --> 01:22:27.233
You, too, Goldilocks.

01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:29.152
Let's go!

01:22:30.279 --> 01:22:31.446
Let's play football!

01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:33.323
All right, Dallas
kicking off to Permian.

01:22:36.035 --> 01:22:37.952
We're underway in the
State Championship.

01:22:38.037 --> 01:22:39.746
Jones' kickoff
carries eight yards.

01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:41.456
Comer should
down it there.

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:44.000
Wait. He's going to bring it out.

01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:48.921
Howser makes the tackle
on the 3-yard line

01:22:49.006 --> 01:22:52.550
and Chavez is very slow to get up
as he was just blasted to the turf.

01:22:52.885 --> 01:22:54.844
Be patient in there.
Keep your cool.

01:22:54.928 --> 01:22:55.928
Yes, sir.

01:22:56.013 --> 01:22:57.513
Be a leader, okay?
Yes, sir.

01:22:57.598 --> 01:23:00.099
The run's 277, dolphin.
Let's go!

01:23:00.184 --> 01:23:02.894
Saturday is finally here.
The Texas Bowl is underway.

01:23:02.978 --> 01:23:07.565
Winchell, first and 10 for
Permian, inside their 5-yard line.

01:23:07.650 --> 01:23:09.651
Winchell,
under center will back up.

01:23:09.735 --> 01:23:11.402
Here comes Stuber!

01:23:13.614 --> 01:23:15.073
Dad gum it!

01:23:17.242 --> 01:23:21.371
And just like that, Stuber's
safety has given Carter a 2-0 lead.

01:23:21.455 --> 01:23:22.747
Which game are we in?

01:23:24.083 --> 01:23:25.750
And Whitaker
will find Grande

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:27.835
with a weak pass
as Chavez is leveled.

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:30.004
And Grande will take
this one to the house

01:23:30.089 --> 01:23:32.173
from more than 50
yards away in play.

01:23:32.257 --> 01:23:34.592
There's not a Panther
within 10 yards of him.

01:23:34.677 --> 01:23:37.095
That's a Carter
Cowboy touchdown.

01:23:38.806 --> 01:23:41.516
Carter will go for two.
They will not kick.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:43.685
No surprise. This team has not kicked

01:23:43.769 --> 01:23:45.895
an extra point or
a field goal all year.

01:23:45.979 --> 01:23:48.272
Whitaker now
will make a bootleg.

01:23:48.357 --> 01:23:50.692
Going left will get
the two-point conversion.

01:23:51.235 --> 01:23:53.528
Cowboys, 10. Permian, 0.

01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:56.406
What's it like
out there, Ivory?

01:23:56.490 --> 01:23:57.699
They're big.

01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:00.284
They're fast.

01:24:02.121 --> 01:24:03.705
Fun ride, huh, big boy?

01:24:03.789 --> 01:24:05.289
They're dirty.

01:24:05.374 --> 01:24:06.791
Ball's gone!

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.209
He's holding me, Ref!

01:24:08.293 --> 01:24:09.794
Plus, they fast.

01:24:09.962 --> 01:24:11.421
Yeah, you said that already.

01:24:11.505 --> 01:24:12.547
Hut!

01:24:15.801 --> 01:24:17.552
You can not fumble
against a team this good.

01:24:17.636 --> 01:24:18.845
Two runs to deep turn!

01:24:18.971 --> 01:24:20.221
Keep your head in the game!

01:24:20.305 --> 01:24:22.223
Help me out! 45-2 split!

01:24:22.975 --> 01:24:26.352
It's going to be Whitaker to
Cane from 26 yards away.

01:24:26.437 --> 01:24:28.062
He levels Chavez.

01:24:30.149 --> 01:24:32.692
And another Carter Cowboy touchdown.

01:24:41.535 --> 01:24:44.245
All day long, baby.

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:45.955
That's it.

01:24:45.998 --> 01:24:48.166
You have to wake up,
understand? Yes, sir.

01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:51.502
You gonna let the offense do
everything, or help us out?

01:24:51.587 --> 01:24:53.629
I'll help us.
You'll help us out? Okay.

01:24:53.714 --> 01:24:55.798
Keep them out
of the end zone.

01:24:55.883 --> 01:24:58.009
If they score more than
we do, we lose the game.

01:24:58.093 --> 01:25:00.011
All right? So wake up!

01:25:00.679 --> 01:25:02.805
It's been all Carter
here in the first quarter.

01:25:02.890 --> 01:25:07.143
Carter over 161 yards
already, and Panthers minus 21.

01:25:07.770 --> 01:25:10.521
Winchell is driven
hard to the turf.

01:25:11.857 --> 01:25:14.358
Comer, stopped at the line again.

01:25:17.029 --> 01:25:18.279
Great grandma's drawers!

01:25:18.363 --> 01:25:19.489
I can't believe that.

01:25:19.573 --> 01:25:21.032
Winchell's nailed again.

01:25:21.116 --> 01:25:24.118
Right now, I don't know if we
need to worry about the scores.

01:25:24.203 --> 01:25:27.246
Just whether or not we'll be able
to take all these boys home.

01:25:27.331 --> 01:25:30.249
Permian's
offensive line is being...

01:25:37.466 --> 01:25:40.092
What in the world are you
doing? Did you see that?

01:25:40.177 --> 01:25:41.552
Back up, Coach.

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:43.137
He almost killed him!

01:25:43.222 --> 01:25:45.723
Clay, this game is quickly
spiraling out of control.

01:25:45.808 --> 01:25:49.227
At some point, you gotta worry
about the safety of the kids.

01:25:50.687 --> 01:25:54.023
The Panthers came into this
ball game really fired up.

01:25:54.107 --> 01:25:56.776
Right now, they've got the
wind just knocked out of them.

01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:58.945
Get your head in the
game. Are you in the game?

01:25:59.029 --> 01:26:00.863
Yes, sir. You have to wake up out there!

01:26:00.948 --> 01:26:01.948
Yes, sir!

01:26:02.032 --> 01:26:04.700
Five minutes left to play in
a half that's been all Carter.

01:26:04.785 --> 01:26:08.037
They lead 18-0. Third
and 1 on the Permian 40.

01:26:08.121 --> 01:26:09.163
Come on, Preacher!

01:26:09.248 --> 01:26:12.792
Whitaker with a pro set in shotgun.
Looking once again to throw.

01:26:12.876 --> 01:26:14.126
Come on, D! Let's go!

01:26:14.211 --> 01:26:16.337
McCleery's coming
on the zone blitz.

01:26:16.421 --> 01:26:18.047
Robert Whitaker
will look to throw.

01:26:18.131 --> 01:26:19.674
Looking right.
Ball is in the air.

01:26:19.758 --> 01:26:21.968
And it's picked off by Ivory Christian.

01:26:22.594 --> 01:26:24.178
And I'm pretty
sure the Preacher Man

01:26:24.263 --> 01:26:25.847
is headed for
the promised land.

01:26:25.931 --> 01:26:29.642
He may take this
one all the way.

01:26:29.726 --> 01:26:33.688
Finally a spark of life in
the form of Ivory Christian!

01:26:33.772 --> 01:26:38.109
Whitaker has taken him
down inside the Mojo 5!

01:26:39.736 --> 01:26:41.863
We've got plenty of
time to get this game.

01:26:41.947 --> 01:26:45.199
Y'all need to wake up out there
and play football. You understand?

01:26:45.284 --> 01:26:46.742
You need to find each other.

01:26:46.827 --> 01:26:49.996
'Cause you need each other
right now, so find each other.

01:26:52.457 --> 01:26:54.208
Let's go.
Let's get on the board.

01:26:54.293 --> 01:26:56.210
Arrow 637.
Count it on one. Ready.

01:26:57.212 --> 01:26:58.212
Jump on the ball!

01:26:58.297 --> 01:27:01.674
Snap to Winchell,
drops back, rolls right.

01:27:01.758 --> 01:27:03.718
He's gonna run
it inside the 5!

01:27:03.802 --> 01:27:06.012
Winchell hurls his way
towards the end zone.

01:27:06.096 --> 01:27:07.889
Anthony has him

01:27:07.973 --> 01:27:10.892
but Mike Winchell will stretch
himself into the end zone

01:27:10.976 --> 01:27:12.894
for the Mojo touchdown!

01:27:13.353 --> 01:27:14.478
Winchell drives
to the goal line.

01:27:14.563 --> 01:27:15.563
Yes!

01:27:15.647 --> 01:27:17.064
Holds the ball
out over the plane.

01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:18.566
He didn't break the plane.

01:27:18.650 --> 01:27:20.484
Coach, we've got him.

01:27:22.446 --> 01:27:24.322
Ref, did you see that?

01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:27.366
What?
He got in.

01:27:27.451 --> 01:27:28.743
There's no way he got in.

01:27:28.827 --> 01:27:29.869
How you going to...

01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:33.122
Winchell's without a
helmet! Kicked in his face!

01:27:33.832 --> 01:27:35.958
There's not a flag
anywhere on the field!

01:27:36.043 --> 01:27:37.877
How can you miss that, Ref?

01:27:38.211 --> 01:27:40.087
Time has run out
in the first half.

01:27:40.172 --> 01:27:45.009
Coach Gary Gaines and his
Mojo Cats trail Carter by 26-7.

01:27:45.552 --> 01:27:46.886
What happened
on that play?

01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:48.262
That's right.
You understand that?

01:27:48.347 --> 01:27:50.264
40 yards? Hell no!

01:27:50.349 --> 01:27:52.767
You guys are not
doing any pass blocking.

01:27:52.851 --> 01:27:55.561
You're just stepping aside
and letting them walk in...

01:27:55.646 --> 01:27:58.689
Pop! That's what I want!
All of you around that ball!

01:27:58.774 --> 01:28:01.609
To go for two and get it
every time? That's ridiculous.

01:28:01.693 --> 01:28:02.818
They haven't
kicked a field goal.

01:28:02.903 --> 01:28:03.986
Relax.

01:28:04.071 --> 01:28:05.780
We not trying to
coach y'all now.

01:28:05.864 --> 01:28:08.574
Coach done gave you all
these adjustments, okay?

01:28:08.659 --> 01:28:10.701
If you do everything
the coach told you to do...

01:28:10.786 --> 01:28:13.704
Two-point conversions, I want
those gone. Here's what we'll do.

01:28:13.789 --> 01:28:16.332
We'll use our speed.
We'll run Texas power.

01:28:16.416 --> 01:28:17.625
What's wrong with y'all?

01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:19.418
Y'all are playing
like little girls!

01:28:19.503 --> 01:28:21.545
You act like you never
played football before!

01:28:21.630 --> 01:28:22.630
These guys are nothing!

01:28:22.714 --> 01:28:24.256
You hear me?
They bleed like we do.

01:28:24.341 --> 01:28:25.758
Yes, sir!
They sweat like we do.

01:28:25.842 --> 01:28:27.885
Do you hear me?
They went through two-a-days.

01:28:27.970 --> 01:28:29.637
We've had two-a-days
in 110 degree heat!

01:28:29.721 --> 01:28:30.680
Yes, sir!

01:28:30.764 --> 01:28:32.139
Hit everything that moves!

01:28:32.224 --> 01:28:33.975
If the ref gets in
your way, you hit him!

01:28:34.059 --> 01:28:35.142
Okay, then. Let's play.

01:28:35.227 --> 01:28:36.310
They're cheating us, too!

01:28:36.395 --> 01:28:37.520
They're against us, too.

01:28:37.604 --> 01:28:39.230
This is our team. This is us!

01:28:39.314 --> 01:28:40.481
Let's go right now!

01:28:40.565 --> 01:28:42.566
Let's get it off
now and let's go!

01:28:42.651 --> 01:28:44.777
Permian is going to
have to step up here

01:28:44.861 --> 01:28:47.029
and establish some
offensive confidence.

01:28:57.624 --> 01:28:58.916
Let's go.

01:29:17.102 --> 01:29:18.769
It's real simple.

01:29:19.771 --> 01:29:22.523
You got two more
quarters and that's it.

01:29:24.401 --> 01:29:28.029
Now most of you have been
playing this game for 10 years.

01:29:28.488 --> 01:29:30.072
You've two more quarters

01:29:30.157 --> 01:29:31.741
and after that most
of you will never play

01:29:31.825 --> 01:29:34.118
this game again
as long as you live.

01:29:34.786 --> 01:29:38.330
You all have known me for a while
and for a long time you've been

01:29:38.415 --> 01:29:40.291
hearing me talk
about being perfect.

01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:42.877
I want you to
understand something.

01:29:43.336 --> 01:29:46.547
To me, being perfect

01:29:47.507 --> 01:29:50.259
is not about that
scoreboard out there.

01:29:51.636 --> 01:29:53.512
It's not about winning.

01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:57.558
It's about you
and your relationship

01:29:57.642 --> 01:30:00.061
to yourself and your
family and your friends.

01:30:01.146 --> 01:30:02.730
Being perfect

01:30:04.274 --> 01:30:07.693
is about being able to
look your friends in the eye

01:30:08.528 --> 01:30:11.906
and know that you
didn't let them down.

01:30:13.033 --> 01:30:15.367
Because you told them
the truth.

01:30:16.036 --> 01:30:18.871
And that truth is, that you
did everything that you could.

01:30:18.955 --> 01:30:22.208
There wasn't one more
thing that you could've done.

01:30:22.918 --> 01:30:25.127
Can you live
in that moment

01:30:25.504 --> 01:30:28.005
as best you can,
with clear eyes

01:30:29.049 --> 01:30:31.008
and love in your heart?

01:30:33.345 --> 01:30:35.262
With joy in your heart.

01:30:37.307 --> 01:30:39.683
If you can do that, gentlemen

01:30:40.852 --> 01:30:42.645
then you're perfect.

01:30:46.358 --> 01:30:48.609
I want you to take a moment

01:30:49.444 --> 01:30:52.446
and I want you to look
each other in the eyes.

01:30:57.661 --> 01:31:00.955
I want you to put each other
in your hearts forever.

01:31:01.581 --> 01:31:05.417
Because forever's about to
happen in just a few minutes.

01:31:08.046 --> 01:31:10.381
I want you to
close your eyes

01:31:14.386 --> 01:31:17.346
and I want you to
think about Boobie Miles

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:20.432
who is your brother.

01:31:23.645 --> 01:31:27.606
And he would die to be out there
on that field with you tonight.

01:31:29.943 --> 01:31:32.778
And I want you to put
that in your hearts.

01:31:35.073 --> 01:31:36.949
Boys, my heart is full.

01:31:41.079 --> 01:31:42.746
My heart's full.

01:31:46.751 --> 01:31:47.960
Ivory.

01:31:50.172 --> 01:31:51.338
"Our Father...

01:31:51.423 --> 01:31:54.008
"Who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

01:31:54.092 --> 01:31:56.218
"Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done.

01:31:56.303 --> 01:31:58.387
"On earth as
it is in heaven.

01:31:58.471 --> 01:32:00.472
"Give us this day
our daily bread,

01:32:00.599 --> 01:32:02.641
"and forgive us
our trespasses.

01:32:02.726 --> 01:32:05.186
"As we forgive those
who trespass against us.

01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:08.480
"Lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.

01:32:08.565 --> 01:32:12.193
"For thine is the kingdom, the
power and the glory forever."

01:32:12.277 --> 01:32:13.402
Amen!

01:32:25.624 --> 01:32:26.957
That's it, baby!

01:32:29.294 --> 01:32:30.628
Keep left!

01:32:30.962 --> 01:32:32.004
Hut!

01:32:36.134 --> 01:32:37.259
Way to go, Ivory!

01:32:37.344 --> 01:32:38.385
Lead and roll.

01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:39.511
Spread right eagle.

01:32:43.225 --> 01:32:44.225
Are you hungry?

01:32:44.309 --> 01:32:45.309
Thank you.

01:32:46.144 --> 01:32:48.479
They're killing
us with their size.

01:32:49.147 --> 01:32:52.066
They're playing some
hard-hitting football.

01:32:57.447 --> 01:32:59.114
Get off the ball!

01:33:00.992 --> 01:33:02.243
Drive hard!

01:33:02.619 --> 01:33:03.619
Shit!

01:33:03.703 --> 01:33:05.746
You will not be here
again. Do you realize that?

01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:07.539
You don't understand.
Boy, we gotta play.

01:33:07.624 --> 01:33:08.707
Golly bum!

01:33:08.792 --> 01:33:11.085
"Z" up 543.
Get to the first down marker.

01:33:11.169 --> 01:33:13.087
I'll hit you as
soon as you get there.

01:33:13.171 --> 01:33:14.713
On one, ready.
Break!

01:33:17.509 --> 01:33:18.759
React to the snap!

01:33:18.843 --> 01:33:20.010
Show me something!

01:33:24.307 --> 01:33:25.432
Did you see that?

01:33:25.517 --> 01:33:26.600
That's the way to play ball.

01:33:26.685 --> 01:33:28.435
You know that
was a bad call!

01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:31.146
Now if he backs up on the
next series, it'll be over.

01:33:31.231 --> 01:33:32.606
He can't drop
back fast enough.

01:33:32.691 --> 01:33:34.191
Yeah, it's good.

01:33:34.859 --> 01:33:37.069
After
the blowout of the first half

01:33:37.153 --> 01:33:39.905
we've seen a showcase of defense
here in the third quarter.

01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:43.993
The score closing with
Carter on top, 26-14.

01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:48.122
10:25 remains in
the fourth quarter.

01:33:48.206 --> 01:33:50.124
It's third
and 10 for Carter

01:33:50.208 --> 01:33:53.002
as Whitaker spins
and hits Drake for 6.

01:33:53.336 --> 01:33:56.171
Tackled by Thomas. It's
going to be fourth down.

01:33:56.256 --> 01:33:58.882
You know Carter's
going for it on fourth.

01:33:59.009 --> 01:34:01.927
Unbelievable. James is not
even going to consider a punt.

01:34:02.012 --> 01:34:05.764
So now Whitaker on fourth
down as Carter will go for it.

01:34:05.849 --> 01:34:08.309
He's gonna look for Graf.
Graf's the main receiver

01:34:08.393 --> 01:34:09.560
and this one
bounces off the turf.

01:34:09.644 --> 01:34:10.811
Incomplete.

01:34:10.895 --> 01:34:12.938
No way.
Got that right here!

01:34:13.481 --> 01:34:15.149
Did you see it?
I'm gonna talk to him.

01:34:15.233 --> 01:34:19.653
I wanna talk to
whoever did see it!

01:34:19.738 --> 01:34:22.489
This is big, man. Anybody
get a better look? Gary?

01:34:22.574 --> 01:34:23.699
Did you turn?

01:34:23.783 --> 01:34:25.284
I turned and looked, but I was lost.

01:34:25.368 --> 01:34:26.452
That ain't no catch.

01:34:26.536 --> 01:34:27.536
I couldn't see it.

01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:29.163
Are you sure he caught it?

01:34:29.247 --> 01:34:30.873
It was a catch, Ref.

01:34:31.666 --> 01:34:34.001
Lee, Mack, set them
up. We got first down.

01:34:34.085 --> 01:34:36.211
What are you talking about?

01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:38.339
That was a bad call!

01:34:38.423 --> 01:34:41.759
This man has it. This man had the catch.

01:34:42.886 --> 01:34:45.179
There's no way. The
ball came off the turf.

01:34:45.263 --> 01:34:46.597
That is bullshit!

01:34:47.515 --> 01:34:49.850
Here's the pass.
Whitaker has found Graf.

01:34:49.934 --> 01:34:52.519
Graf makes a one-handed
phenomenal catch

01:34:52.604 --> 01:34:54.271
for another Carter TD.

01:34:54.814 --> 01:34:57.524
Chavez in frustration
levels him in the end zone.

01:34:57.609 --> 01:34:58.567
Personal foul
on the defense.

01:34:58.651 --> 01:35:01.320
That's gonna cost
Permian 15 on the kickoff.

01:35:02.113 --> 01:35:05.699
Following the Carter two-point
conversion they now lead 34-14.

01:35:05.784 --> 01:35:07.701
These Panthers are
getting beat physically.

01:35:07.786 --> 01:35:10.037
They're getting beat
mentally. They're really down.

01:35:10.121 --> 01:35:13.248
We've seen this before but Permian's
always been on the other end.

01:35:13.333 --> 01:35:14.792
We're looking
for the next play.

01:35:14.876 --> 01:35:16.960
Comer got across the 5.

01:35:18.171 --> 01:35:21.256
Comer, to the 30, to the 35.

01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:23.509
Comer could go
all the way, folks.

01:35:23.593 --> 01:35:28.555
Comer, 25,
20, 15, 10, 5!

01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:32.726
That's a Mojo touchdown!

01:35:32.811 --> 01:35:36.730
Chris Comer has brought
Permian back one more time.

01:35:36.815 --> 01:35:40.442
We're in this
ball game now.

01:35:40.527 --> 01:35:44.738
5:27 to play.
Carter still leads 34-21.

01:35:44.823 --> 01:35:45.948
Come on, Chavo!

01:35:46.032 --> 01:35:47.741
They will
pitch it to Grande.

01:35:47.826 --> 01:35:50.035
Ripped away by Chavez!

01:35:54.999 --> 01:35:56.208
Let's go!

01:35:57.502 --> 01:35:58.752
Come on!

01:35:58.837 --> 01:36:01.255
Now strong right,
81 Trojan horse.

01:36:05.176 --> 01:36:07.428
All right, here we go.
Let's shock these punks.

01:36:07.512 --> 01:36:09.596
Strong right,
81 Trojan horse.

01:36:09.681 --> 01:36:12.683
Me and you, baby. We got it.
Throw it deep. On one, ready.

01:36:14.686 --> 01:36:17.688
Mike Winchell to Don
Billingsley will go right.

01:36:17.772 --> 01:36:19.773
There's room to run,
but stop, wait.

01:36:19.858 --> 01:36:21.859
Instead he's looking for a receiver.

01:36:22.193 --> 01:36:23.819
Winchell's open!

01:36:25.864 --> 01:36:27.865
Winchell's open
in the end zone.

01:36:27.991 --> 01:36:29.950
Winchell makes
a tremendous catch!

01:36:30.034 --> 01:36:35.205
Winchell, with a touchdown
reception scores the Mojo touchdown!

01:36:41.004 --> 01:36:42.254
One more.

01:36:42.672 --> 01:36:45.340
But is it too little, too
late for Coach Gary Gaines?

01:36:45.592 --> 01:36:48.051
Mojo defense is really
gonna have to step it up

01:36:48.136 --> 01:36:50.679
if they have a prayer of winning
the State Championship.

01:36:50.763 --> 01:36:53.724
Grande, across midfield.
Tripped up at the 40.

01:36:53.808 --> 01:36:55.017
First down!
Let's go, baby!

01:36:55.101 --> 01:36:57.811
The clock now has to be a
concern for Coach Gary Gaines

01:36:57.896 --> 01:36:59.229
and the Permian staff.

01:36:59.314 --> 01:37:00.898
We need to stop.

01:37:01.399 --> 01:37:04.276
First and 10 now for
Carter from the Permian 30.

01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:06.069
Less than two
minutes to play.

01:37:06.154 --> 01:37:09.281
One more Carter first down,
folks, and that will be it.

01:37:10.909 --> 01:37:12.159
Grande hit!

01:37:12.243 --> 01:37:13.619
Yeah, baby!

01:37:14.078 --> 01:37:16.663
They do know how to tackle.
All right!

01:37:16.748 --> 01:37:18.999
It's my edge.

01:37:19.083 --> 01:37:20.876
Second down and long.

01:37:21.711 --> 01:37:23.629
Dropped for a loss.

01:37:25.089 --> 01:37:26.798
Just keep rolling it, baby.

01:37:26.883 --> 01:37:28.133
Come on!

01:37:28.218 --> 01:37:29.676
The clock
continues to roll.

01:37:29.761 --> 01:37:31.220
This will set up
third down.

01:37:31.304 --> 01:37:34.640
Permian desperately needs
a stop to get the ball back.

01:37:34.724 --> 01:37:37.768
Grande right up
the gut over Chavez!

01:37:37.852 --> 01:37:40.854
Maybe just short of what
he needs for a first down.

01:37:40.939 --> 01:37:43.565
First down here, and the game's over.

01:37:45.151 --> 01:37:46.693
It didn't make it.

01:37:46.778 --> 01:37:47.861
It's short.

01:37:47.946 --> 01:37:49.196
That's short, by inches!

01:37:51.574 --> 01:37:54.076
James immediately
signals he's going for it.

01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:56.828
James is going to gamble.
He can get these four inches

01:37:56.913 --> 01:37:59.623
and win the State Championship,
right here, right now.

01:37:59.707 --> 01:38:02.376
Here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna do a Texas stunt.

01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:04.962
Ivory, you and Steen,
I want you to twist.

01:38:05.046 --> 01:38:06.380
Steen, you go first.
Yo, Coach.

01:38:06.464 --> 01:38:08.840
Ivory, you come off his
butt into the "A" gap.

01:38:08.925 --> 01:38:10.634
Lucas,
crash the "A" gap, too.

01:38:10.718 --> 01:38:12.469
Let's shut these
cocky sons-of-guns down.

01:38:12.554 --> 01:38:14.721
Now let's go.
Let's shut them down.

01:38:15.473 --> 01:38:18.183
Let's go. Let's shut
them down right now.

01:38:18.893 --> 01:38:20.602
- Right here.
- Take them.

01:38:21.646 --> 01:38:23.397
West Texas football, baby.

01:38:23.481 --> 01:38:25.732
Whitaker comes to the line.

01:38:25.817 --> 01:38:26.775
Okay, let's go.

01:38:26.859 --> 01:38:27.818
Come on, D.

01:38:27.902 --> 01:38:30.571
Looks across.
Calls the cadence.

01:38:30.655 --> 01:38:31.697
Hut!

01:38:32.198 --> 01:38:34.658
Hands to his running back.
Grande!

01:38:43.835 --> 01:38:45.002
Damn it, boy!

01:38:47.714 --> 01:38:50.173
I want you to show them
who we are. Yes, sir.

01:38:50.258 --> 01:38:51.508
Okay? Show them who we are.

01:38:51.593 --> 01:38:52.801
Execute!

01:38:52.885 --> 01:38:55.512
As Winchell gathers his
teammates up into a huddle

01:38:55.597 --> 01:38:57.931
he can see on the big
clock down in the end zone

01:38:58.016 --> 01:39:00.475
one minute and
40 seconds to play.

01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:05.439
One time-out left, and he has
75 yards of Astrodome turf to go.

01:39:05.523 --> 01:39:06.523
Go!

01:39:06.608 --> 01:39:08.942
Green, 12. Hut!

01:39:09.027 --> 01:39:10.485
Winchell swings
it out to Comer.

01:39:10.570 --> 01:39:11.945
Comer has it,
picks up a block.

01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:13.488
Thataway, Comer! On three!

01:39:13.573 --> 01:39:15.407
Off to Billingsley.

01:39:15.491 --> 01:39:17.284
Billingsley great job of picking up

01:39:17.368 --> 01:39:21.204
the first down. Stops the
clock by going out of bounds.

01:39:22.498 --> 01:39:24.499
Okay, let's go.
Let's get wild.

01:39:27.629 --> 01:39:28.879
Come on, Michael!

01:39:28.963 --> 01:39:29.963
You or Raymond!

01:39:30.048 --> 01:39:31.006
Let's go!

01:39:31.090 --> 01:39:34.843
Winchell takes time as he drops
back. He's looking to the right.

01:39:34.927 --> 01:39:37.929
Payne is wide open
down the right sideline!

01:39:38.014 --> 01:39:39.931
The pass is in the air!

01:39:44.562 --> 01:39:47.064
The Tennessee-bound Trissell
comes across the field

01:39:47.148 --> 01:39:48.982
to knock the ball loose.

01:39:49.067 --> 01:39:51.151
Payne had it.

01:39:51.235 --> 01:39:54.112
I'll tell you. Mike Winchell,
folks showing how tough he is...

01:39:54.197 --> 01:39:55.238
Come on, baby, get up!

01:39:55.323 --> 01:39:57.366
...hanging there under
unsurmounting pressure.

01:39:57.450 --> 01:39:59.993
Winchell appears to be okay,
folks. He's one tough dude.

01:40:00.119 --> 01:40:02.537
He's back on his feet. Let's
go, baby! We need you, Mike!

01:40:04.248 --> 01:40:06.333
"I" right, 90.

01:40:06.417 --> 01:40:08.126
Mike, you all right?

01:40:08.252 --> 01:40:09.961
Yeah, I'm all right, man.

01:40:11.381 --> 01:40:13.548
Under a minute to play,
52 seconds.

01:40:13.633 --> 01:40:17.969
Winchell will scan, fake it
to Comer. It's a bootleg pass.

01:40:23.810 --> 01:40:28.313
He's latched onto it. It's
Wyles, down to the Carter 25!

01:40:28.648 --> 01:40:30.774
Look, I want you to feel it.

01:40:31.275 --> 01:40:32.567
Show me some heart.

01:40:32.652 --> 01:40:35.570
Permian's showing what
a tough out they are.

01:40:35.822 --> 01:40:37.614
- Come on, Donny.
Go!

01:40:43.496 --> 01:40:45.997
That's a first down!
Whose game, baby?

01:40:46.082 --> 01:40:48.709
Whose game is it?
Come on, there we go.

01:40:48.793 --> 01:40:51.545
Clay, he's hurt.
He grabs his shoulder.

01:40:54.549 --> 01:40:56.216
Trapper helps
him off the field.

01:40:56.300 --> 01:40:58.009
Feels like he dislocated his shoulder.

01:40:58.094 --> 01:40:59.636
See you, fella!

01:40:59.887 --> 01:41:01.847
Shake it off.
Get back out there.

01:41:01.931 --> 01:41:02.973
Strong left 90
"Z" five, ready?

01:41:03.057 --> 01:41:04.057
Break!

01:41:04.142 --> 01:41:07.728
Permian with 35 seconds
to play go to Comer!

01:41:07.854 --> 01:41:10.147
And Comer
over the red zone.

01:41:12.859 --> 01:41:14.526
Did you see that?
I'll back up when

01:41:14.610 --> 01:41:16.194
I'm through
talking to you.

01:41:16.279 --> 01:41:20.115
Comer is on Queer Street, walking
towards the Carter sideline.

01:41:22.326 --> 01:41:25.495
Winchell on third down
again, will drop the pass.

01:41:26.622 --> 01:41:28.999
Hard to the turf,
and Permian will

01:41:29.125 --> 01:41:31.501
have to burn
their final time-out.

01:41:31.586 --> 01:41:33.962
The third and final time-out.

01:41:34.046 --> 01:41:36.131
They have to pass. They've
no choice but to pass.

01:41:36.215 --> 01:41:37.215
All their backs are out.

01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:38.508
We gotta go to the air.

01:41:38.593 --> 01:41:39.760
You gotta throw the football.

01:41:39.844 --> 01:41:41.511
They ain't got
no running back.

01:41:41.679 --> 01:41:43.388
Trapper,
I need a running back.

01:41:43.473 --> 01:41:46.057
All right. Just relax.
We'll pop this back in.

01:41:46.142 --> 01:41:49.186
On the count of three.
One, two...

01:41:51.272 --> 01:41:52.939
We're good to go.

01:41:55.818 --> 01:41:57.444
You're going to
set a Bronco stunt

01:41:57.528 --> 01:42:00.030
then drop into the full
pass, prevent coverage.

01:42:00.114 --> 01:42:01.364
You got that?
Got it.

01:42:01.449 --> 01:42:04.159
So, Clay, if you're Gary
Gaines, what do you do?

01:42:04.243 --> 01:42:06.411
Coach Gaines is done
out of running backs.

01:42:06.496 --> 01:42:07.788
He's gotta go to the air.

01:42:07.872 --> 01:42:09.915
A vertical smash
and a double out.

01:42:09.999 --> 01:42:11.458
I agree.

01:42:11.542 --> 01:42:13.919
Coach, we gotta get number
one across the goal line.

01:42:14.003 --> 01:42:15.086
Squeeze it.
I agree.

01:42:15.171 --> 01:42:16.713
Hang on a second.

01:42:16.881 --> 01:42:18.423
Billingsley,
can you do it?

01:42:18.508 --> 01:42:19.633
Yes, sir.

01:42:19.759 --> 01:42:20.926
You sure?

01:42:21.010 --> 01:42:22.803
Can you hang onto the ball?
Yes, sir.

01:42:22.887 --> 01:42:23.929
Okay, then.

01:42:24.055 --> 01:42:25.138
Now here's what
we're going to do.

01:42:25.223 --> 01:42:26.807
We're going to do
"I" right wiggle,

01:42:26.891 --> 01:42:29.142
34 switchblade.
Now, let's go, Mike.

01:42:30.061 --> 01:42:32.896
Billingsley, they're gonna
try to strip the ball from you.

01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:34.439
Cover it. Cover the points.

01:42:34.524 --> 01:42:36.107
Roll with it.
Don't resist it.

01:42:36.192 --> 01:42:37.984
You got it, baby.
No more fumbles.

01:42:38.069 --> 01:42:39.986
That's right.

01:42:40.071 --> 01:42:41.655
Let's go, baby.
It's in your hands.

01:42:41.739 --> 01:42:44.616
Don't think about that shoulder.
Just keep driving your feet.

01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:47.494
"I" right wiggle,
34 switchblade.

01:42:47.578 --> 01:42:48.912
For the State Championship.

01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:50.372
I love all of you, baby.

01:42:50.456 --> 01:42:52.249
I love all of you.
Let's go on one, ready?

01:42:52.333 --> 01:42:53.333
Break!

01:42:53.417 --> 01:42:56.628
55,000 people in the
Houston Astrodome, folks

01:42:56.712 --> 01:43:00.340
and every seat is empty because
everyone is on their feet.

01:43:06.556 --> 01:43:08.557
His offensive line digs in.

01:43:08.641 --> 01:43:11.768
The Carter defense
digs in to face it.

01:43:15.273 --> 01:43:16.690
Down!
Switch.

01:43:16.941 --> 01:43:20.944
312!

01:43:21.153 --> 01:43:22.445
Run it right
down his throat.

01:43:22.530 --> 01:43:23.780
Hut!

01:43:23.865 --> 01:43:25.615
He hands it off
to Don Billingsley!

01:43:27.785 --> 01:43:31.121
Billingsley is
looking like Larry Csonka!

01:43:32.874 --> 01:43:33.915
Come on!

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:38.670
Billingsley pushes, runs over
another Dallas Carter Cowboy.

01:43:40.298 --> 01:43:43.008
Down to the 1-yard line.

01:43:48.681 --> 01:43:50.807
What guts to call
a run in that situation!

01:43:50.892 --> 01:43:52.684
Fooled everybody
on the field.

01:43:52.768 --> 01:43:55.478
Wait a minute. I'm seeing
a hold call by the official.

01:43:55.563 --> 01:43:57.105
Dad gum it!

01:43:57.189 --> 01:43:58.815
Ten-yard penalty. Still fourth down.

01:43:59.025 --> 01:44:00.650
That's bullshit!

01:44:02.612 --> 01:44:04.404
Strong right, 20 to Frasier!

01:44:04.488 --> 01:44:08.033
Winchell must hurry. The clock will
start as soon as the ball is reset.

01:44:08.117 --> 01:44:09.743
Come on, Frasier!

01:44:09.911 --> 01:44:11.202
Let's go! Hurry up!

01:44:11.287 --> 01:44:15.248
32, 330! Set! Hut!

01:44:40.149 --> 01:44:42.692
It's Mike Winchell
down to the 5!

01:44:48.824 --> 01:44:50.116
Is he in?

01:44:53.788 --> 01:44:56.539
You got him short.
That's the ball game!

01:49:11.337 --> 01:49:13.296
I'm gonna miss the heat.

01:49:14.506 --> 01:49:16.716
I'm going to miss the lights.

01:49:17.301 --> 01:49:19.719
Yeah. Me, too.

01:49:25.309 --> 01:49:28.228
Stay low, boys.
Keep those feet moving.

01:49:30.397 --> 01:49:32.815
Hey, Chavo. Be perfect.

01:49:33.234 --> 01:49:34.776
You be perfect.

01:49:38.614 --> 01:49:40.114
See you, Mike.

01:49:41.283 --> 01:49:42.742
See you, Don.

01:49:44.912 --> 01:49:46.496
See you, Chavo.
