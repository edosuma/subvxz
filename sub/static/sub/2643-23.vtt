WEBVTT

00:02.139 --> 00:05.082
Hey, do me a favor
and take table seven.

00:05.100 --> 00:07.375
You mean the one
with my 118-pound

00:07.376 --> 00:08.979
rock-hard stud of a fiancé

00:08.980 --> 00:12.292
who's prone to canker
sores and pinkeye?

00:12.575 --> 00:15.481
Nah, I prefer to look at it as
the one with my ex-boyfriend

00:15.482 --> 00:18.157
and his gorgeous, successful
and sophisticated girlfriend,

00:18.158 --> 00:20.130
who makes me feel like
a toothless Okie.

00:22.437 --> 00:24.778
Do you want me to spill
hot soup on her?

00:25.748 --> 00:27.887
Oh, please-- you're not
that kind of person.

00:27.888 --> 00:29.023
I know.

00:29.024 --> 00:31.263
But if she orders
something low-fat

00:31.264 --> 00:34.138
I'll totally give her
the full-fat version.

00:36.012 --> 00:37.481
Uh, that's my water.

00:37.482 --> 00:38.584
What?

00:38.585 --> 00:39.855
My water.
You're drinking it.

00:39.856 --> 00:42.362
D-Dear Lord!

00:42.363 --> 00:44.401
Have you been drinking it?

00:44.402 --> 00:46.173
Yes. It's my water.

00:46.174 --> 00:47.678
Well, that's it then.

00:47.679 --> 00:50.517
I'm dead.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.256
Here we go...

00:52.257 --> 00:54.964
I'm sorry, do I really need
to connect the dots for you?

00:54.965 --> 00:56.600
The backwash into this glass

00:56.601 --> 00:59.174
is every pathogen that calls
your mouth home, sweet home.

00:59.175 --> 01:02.649
Not to mention the visitors who
arrive on the dancing tongue

01:02.650 --> 01:04.555
of your subtropical girlfriend.

01:05.592 --> 01:07.295
Hey! That's my sister

01:07.296 --> 01:08.867
and my country
you're talking about.

01:08.868 --> 01:10.570
Leonard may have
defiled one,

01:10.571 --> 01:12.844
but I won't have you
talking smack about the other.

01:13.880 --> 01:15.583
You guys ready to order?

01:15.584 --> 01:17.823
Yes, I'd like a seven-day
course of penicillin,

01:17.824 --> 01:22.266
some, uh, syrup of ipecac--
to induce vomiting-- and a mint.

01:22.267 --> 01:24.338
I don't understand.

01:24.339 --> 01:25.809
He drank from
Leonard's glass.

01:25.810 --> 01:27.212
"He drank from
Leonard's glass"--

01:27.213 --> 01:29.650
the words they'll be
carving into my tombstone.

01:30.453 --> 01:32.725
That's actually my napkin.

01:32.726 --> 01:33.728
Oh, this is a nightmare!

01:33.729 --> 01:36.600
- Where are you going?
- To the bar,

01:36.601 --> 01:39.006
to sterilize my mouth
with alcohol.

01:39.007 --> 01:41.645

Original Air Date on May 12, 2011

02:05.431 --> 02:07.913
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==

02:08.073 --> 02:09.806
All right. Here you go.

02:09.806 --> 02:11.307
Two lemonades,

02:11.308 --> 02:13.108
one iced tea

02:13.109 --> 02:15.476
and a root beer for Priya.

02:15.477 --> 02:19.612
- Is it diet?
- That's what you ordered.

02:19.613 --> 02:22.448
Thank you.

02:22.449 --> 02:23.516
Hey, have you and Howard

02:23.517 --> 02:24.917
started planning
your wedding yet?

02:24.918 --> 02:27.185
Yeah. We're thinking
of having it on a cliff

02:27.186 --> 02:28.586
overlooking the ocean.

02:28.587 --> 02:31.155
Nothing soothes
those pre-wedding jitters

02:31.156 --> 02:34.491
like the thought
of falling and drowning.

02:34.492 --> 02:35.993
What did your mother say

02:35.994 --> 02:37.394
when you told her you were
getting married?

02:37.395 --> 02:38.762
He hasn't told her yet.

02:38.763 --> 02:40.063
He's waiting for
the right time.

02:40.064 --> 02:43.833
I was thinking of weaving
it into her eulogy.

02:43.834 --> 02:46.836
Howard, you've got
to tell your mother.

02:46.837 --> 02:48.036
Hey, have you told your parents
you're dating

02:48.037 --> 02:50.038
this short glass
of skim milk here?

02:51.774 --> 02:54.041
Uh... that's different.

02:54.042 --> 02:56.074
First of all,
we're not engaged;

02:56.075 --> 02:57.842
and second,
Indian parents

02:57.843 --> 02:59.609
are very protective
of their children.

02:59.610 --> 03:01.642
Right, right,
whereas Jewish mothers

03:01.643 --> 03:05.211
take a casual, la-di-da
approach to their sons.

03:07.615 --> 03:10.884
I gargled with tequila and may
have swallowed a teeny bit.

03:10.885 --> 03:12.051
- You all right?
- Fine.

03:12.052 --> 03:13.552
Thank you for asking.

03:13.553 --> 03:15.586
I love you so much.

03:18.555 --> 03:20.689
Fire demon.

03:20.690 --> 03:23.324
Ooh, fire demon.

03:23.325 --> 03:26.159
Sheldon's turning up the heat...

03:27.995 --> 03:29.261
Troll master.

03:29.262 --> 03:30.695
Check it! Howard pulls one out

03:30.696 --> 03:33.097
from under the bridge. Nice!

03:34.800 --> 03:36.002
Water nymph.

03:36.003 --> 03:37.403
Oh, yeah, she's got puddles

03:37.404 --> 03:39.405
in all the right places.

03:40.206 --> 03:41.406
Could you please
play the game

03:41.407 --> 03:42.941
without commenting
on every card?

03:42.942 --> 03:45.177
Sorry.

03:45.178 --> 03:47.511
Walking tree.

03:51.114 --> 03:52.781
Last one.

03:52.782 --> 03:55.517
I'm taking a stroll
and I'm sporting wood.

03:59.622 --> 04:03.123
Okay, the <i>Eagle</i> has landed.

04:03.124 --> 04:04.591
What's going on?

04:04.592 --> 04:05.791
Bernadette
and my mother are having

04:05.792 --> 04:07.993
a get-to-know-you lunch
at the Old Town Deli.

04:07.994 --> 04:09.328
Oh, that sounds lovely.

04:09.329 --> 04:10.362
Hope so.

04:10.363 --> 04:11.696
Of course, if history
is any indication,

04:11.697 --> 04:12.697
my mother will swallow her whole

04:12.698 --> 04:15.700
and spit out her bones
like an owl.

04:16.567 --> 04:18.668
Have you met
Bernadette's parents?

04:18.668 --> 04:20.702
You mean Adolf and Eva?

04:21.838 --> 04:23.372
Not yet.

04:23.373 --> 04:26.308
One goose step at a time.

04:26.309 --> 04:28.310
Sheldon,
that's my water.

04:28.311 --> 04:29.678
Oh, dear Lord!

04:33.315 --> 04:35.049
That's not your water.

04:36.051 --> 04:37.884
I know.

04:39.587 --> 04:41.488
Where's the mouthwash?!

04:42.423 --> 04:44.824
"Where" indeed.

04:46.960 --> 04:50.095
Ma, I'm home!

04:50.096 --> 04:51.496
Where are you?

04:51.497 --> 04:54.932
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
I'm in the toilet!

04:54.933 --> 04:57.034
So, how'd it go?!

04:57.035 --> 04:58.368
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Too soon to say!

04:58.369 --> 05:00.737
I'm not done yet!

05:02.673 --> 05:05.341
No, I mean lunch, today,
with Bernadette!

05:05.342 --> 05:07.209
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Oh!

05:07.210 --> 05:08.644
I had a pastrami
sandwich.

05:08.645 --> 05:10.845
She had eggplant lasagna.

05:10.846 --> 05:14.314
Like that's what a person
orders in a Jewish deli.

05:15.482 --> 05:18.883
Besides food, did you get along?
Did you talk?

05:18.884 --> 05:22.519
Oh, sure! Did you know
she's going to school

05:22.520 --> 05:24.988
to become a
microbiologist?!

05:25.990 --> 05:28.391
No, she never mentioned it.

05:29.694 --> 05:33.629
I bet she did and
you didn't listen!

05:34.697 --> 05:36.900
Yeah, that's probably it.
So, what do you think?

05:36.901 --> 05:39.168
Do you like her?
She's great, huh?

05:39.169 --> 05:40.570
She's a lovely girl!

05:40.571 --> 05:42.272
Cute as a button!

05:42.273 --> 05:46.576
That's good to hear,
'cause I've got some news.

05:46.577 --> 05:48.143
I hope it's
good news,

05:48.144 --> 05:51.445
because I've got nothing but
disappointment in here!

05:59.983 --> 06:02.817
Bernadette and I
are getting married.

06:07.823 --> 06:10.124
Ma?

06:10.125 --> 06:12.861
You too busy bearing down?

06:14.831 --> 06:16.998
Ma?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.901
Oh, my God, Ma? Ma? Ma?

06:20.902 --> 06:22.970
Stand back,
I'm gonna break the door down!

06:30.810 --> 06:33.145
Son of a bitch!
Ma, help!

06:36.649 --> 06:37.682
Hey.

06:37.683 --> 06:39.016
Hello.

06:39.017 --> 06:40.284
Haven't
seen you in a while.

06:40.285 --> 06:41.618
How's it going?

06:41.619 --> 06:45.087
Oh, other than waiting out
the exponential growth period

06:45.088 --> 06:46.956
of the virulent organisms

06:46.957 --> 06:48.624
trooping through
my microvilli

06:48.625 --> 06:52.894
into my circulatory system--
hunky-dory.

06:58.099 --> 06:59.432
Did I say something
amusing?

06:59.433 --> 07:03.135
I don't know, maybe,
I have no idea what you said.

07:03.136 --> 07:06.571
So your mirth is merely
a discharge of nervous energy

07:06.572 --> 07:09.006
with no semantic content at all?

07:09.007 --> 07:12.010
My mirth. Classic.

07:12.011 --> 07:14.545
Is there a station
coming up

07:14.546 --> 07:18.015
where I can board your
giggling train of thought?

07:18.016 --> 07:20.183
It's not a big deal, Sheldon.

07:20.184 --> 07:21.951
It's just,
ever since Leonard's been

07:21.952 --> 07:24.420
dating Raj's sister,
I've had to keep my distance.

07:24.421 --> 07:27.322
I don't get to hear
all your jibber-jabber.

07:27.323 --> 07:28.690
Jibber-jabber?!

07:28.691 --> 07:30.325
I don't jibber-jabber.

07:30.326 --> 07:32.293
What are you doing
at work these days?

07:32.294 --> 07:35.496
Oh, I'm working on
time-dependent backgrounds

07:35.497 --> 07:36.897
in string theory,

07:36.898 --> 07:38.431
specifically quantum
field theory

07:38.432 --> 07:40.733
in "d-dimensional"
de Sitter space.

07:42.135 --> 07:45.070
Okay, come on, even you have
to admit that's jibber-jabber.

07:46.907 --> 07:48.507
Interesting, do you know

07:48.508 --> 07:50.676
where the phrase
"jibber-jabber" comes from?

07:50.677 --> 07:53.145
Oh, my God,
you're about to jibber-jabber

07:53.146 --> 07:55.113
about jibber-jabber.

07:58.550 --> 08:00.418
Howard and his mother
are at the hospital.

08:00.419 --> 08:02.220
- Come on, we gotta go.
- Oh, my God! What happened?

08:02.221 --> 08:03.421
I don't know, I just got a text.
Come on, hurry.

08:03.422 --> 08:05.256
Okay.

08:08.260 --> 08:10.128
Sheldon, let's go!

08:10.129 --> 08:12.196
To a hospital?!

08:12.197 --> 08:13.731
Full of sick people?!

08:15.000 --> 08:17.002
Oh, I don't think so.

08:17.003 --> 08:20.005
Okay, well, your friend and his
mother are there, we're going.

08:20.006 --> 08:21.840
I can't.

08:21.841 --> 08:24.175
Oh, don't tell me you're
afraid of germs.

08:24.176 --> 08:27.478
Not all germs.

08:27.479 --> 08:29.880
Just the ones that will kill me.

08:29.881 --> 08:32.482
It's the same way I'm not
afraid of all steak knives--

08:32.484 --> 08:35.385
just the ones that might be
plunged in my thorax.

08:35.385 --> 08:38.020
Fine, I'll tell Howard
you didn't come

08:38.022 --> 08:39.054
because you're more concerned

08:39.056 --> 08:40.423
about your own well-being
than his.

08:40.424 --> 08:43.259
I would think
he would know that.

08:44.929 --> 08:46.729
Okay, you know what?
You are unbelievable.

08:46.730 --> 08:48.398
You buy all these
superhero T-shirts,

08:48.399 --> 08:49.732
but when it's time for you

08:49.733 --> 08:51.200
to step up
and do the right thing,

08:51.201 --> 08:53.102
you just hide
in the laundry room.

08:54.538 --> 08:55.939
Fine, I'll go.

08:57.108 --> 09:00.209
Just for the record,
my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital.

09:00.210 --> 09:02.478
She went in to
visit my Uncle Roger,

09:02.479 --> 09:04.981
caught something and bit
the dust a week later.

09:04.982 --> 09:07.283
The two of them
now share a coffee can

09:07.284 --> 09:08.783
on my mother's mantel.

09:14.620 --> 09:16.420
So I knocked down
the bathroom door,

09:16.474 --> 09:17.908
picked up my poor
unconscious mother,

09:17.909 --> 09:19.042
carried her to the car,

09:19.043 --> 09:22.045
and drove like a madman
to the emergency room.

09:22.046 --> 09:23.646
You're a real
hero, Howard.

09:23.647 --> 09:25.915
No, I did what
any son would do.

09:25.916 --> 09:29.552
Hang on a second--
you picked up your mother?

09:31.452 --> 09:35.086
Her own legs
are barely able to do that.

09:35.767 --> 09:37.767
I was filled
with adrenaline.

09:37.768 --> 09:40.537
It happens to be how women
lift cars off babies.

09:40.538 --> 09:43.472
Yeah, I'm saying,
it'd be easier to lift a car.

09:44.975 --> 09:47.676
What can I tell you?
After I found the courage

09:47.677 --> 09:50.412
to put her pants back on,
I was unstoppable.

09:51.948 --> 09:53.382
So, how is she?

09:53.383 --> 09:55.350
They're running tests--
I don't know.

09:55.351 --> 09:59.053
It may have been a heart attack
or heart-attack-like event.

09:59.054 --> 10:00.121
What's the difference?

10:00.122 --> 10:01.855
A heart-attack-like event

10:01.856 --> 10:04.791
is an event
that's like a heart attack.

10:04.792 --> 10:07.794
Thanks for clearing that up.

10:07.795 --> 10:10.663
Regardless, coronary problems
are eminently treatable.

10:10.664 --> 10:12.932
What's more likely going
to kill Howard's mother

10:12.933 --> 10:14.200
are the
antibiotic-resistant

10:14.201 --> 10:16.201
super-bugs festering
in every nook and cranny

10:16.202 --> 10:17.736
of this hospital.

10:18.971 --> 10:20.405
Okay, you're not helping.

10:20.406 --> 10:22.906
Disagree.

10:23.841 --> 10:26.276
Go sit over there.

10:26.277 --> 10:28.478
I'll sit over there--
it looks cleaner.

10:31.782 --> 10:34.083
Is there a history of
heart disease in your family?

10:34.084 --> 10:38.182
My family is the history
of heart disease.

10:38.183 --> 10:39.481
There's a cave painting
in France

10:39.482 --> 10:41.683
of one of my ancestors
doing this:

10:45.154 --> 10:47.655
So it's probably genetic.

10:47.656 --> 10:49.323
Well, maybe.

10:49.324 --> 10:52.358
Mom also had just gotten some
news that might have upset her.

10:52.359 --> 10:53.726
What?

10:53.727 --> 10:55.161
It's not important.

10:55.162 --> 10:57.096
Come on, Howard,
I'm going to be your wife.

10:57.097 --> 10:58.830
You can share
anything with me.

10:58.831 --> 11:01.866
You'd think that.
But no.

11:05.737 --> 11:08.038
You told her we were
going to get married

11:08.039 --> 11:09.639
and she had
a heart attack?

11:09.640 --> 11:13.342
You can't take
that personally.

11:13.343 --> 11:15.310
How else is she supposed
to take it?

11:15.311 --> 11:16.545
What you've got to

11:16.546 --> 11:20.181
keep in mind is that
ever since my dad left,

11:20.182 --> 11:22.983
I've been the whole world
to my mother.

11:22.984 --> 11:25.185
I mean, she'd be
threatened by any woman

11:25.186 --> 11:28.121
who can give me
what she can't.

11:28.122 --> 11:30.957
You mean sexual
intercourse?

11:33.850 --> 11:37.819
Well, when you say it like
that you make it sound creepy.

11:37.820 --> 11:39.020
What happened?

11:39.021 --> 11:40.255
Howard's mother had
a heart attack

11:40.342 --> 11:41.876
because I have
sex with him

11:41.911 --> 11:43.611
and she can't.

11:47.428 --> 11:50.129
Bernie, wait!

11:50.130 --> 11:54.732
I'll give you $1,000
if you'll drive me home.

11:55.901 --> 11:58.035
Nice of you to
come for Howard.

11:58.036 --> 12:00.904
Well, he's my friend.
It's what you do.

12:03.239 --> 12:05.874
I'm sorry, did
I miss something?

12:05.875 --> 12:07.808
It's just so weird.

12:07.809 --> 12:09.776
Howard Wolowitz
is my friend.

12:09.777 --> 12:12.378
You know, once he tried to
stick his tongue down my throat

12:12.379 --> 12:13.679
and I broke his nose.

12:13.680 --> 12:16.248
That's a little easier
to believe

12:16.249 --> 12:17.415
than he's your friend.

12:17.416 --> 12:19.417
Yeah, tell me about it.

12:19.418 --> 12:22.453
You know, my brother had a group
of friends like this in India.

12:22.454 --> 12:24.921
They dressed up in leotards and
goggles and called themselves

12:24.922 --> 12:26.856
the New Delhi
Power Rangers.

12:27.624 --> 12:29.959
You mean when
he was little.

12:29.960 --> 12:32.727
Not as little as
you'd want him to be.

12:35.097 --> 12:36.630
You know,
this stuff is horrible.

12:36.631 --> 12:38.531
You want to see if we
can find the cafeteria

12:38.532 --> 12:39.932
and get real coffee?
Sure.

12:39.933 --> 12:41.367
We're going to the cafeteria
to get some coffee.

12:41.368 --> 12:42.567
You want anything?

12:42.568 --> 12:44.435
I'm fine.

12:44.436 --> 12:46.904
That's nice that
they're getting along.

12:46.905 --> 12:49.405
Your girlfriend and your
ex-girlfriend are hanging out together?

12:49.406 --> 12:52.775
Oh, yeah, that can
only be good for you.

12:55.848 --> 12:57.180
What are you talking about?

12:57.181 --> 12:58.615
One of them
broke up with you.

12:58.616 --> 13:01.118
Do you really want her
telling the other one why?

13:01.119 --> 13:03.120
I don't care.

13:03.121 --> 13:05.122
I don't have
anything to hide.

13:05.123 --> 13:06.256
Good, good.

13:06.257 --> 13:09.225
Then you have nothing
to worry about.

13:09.226 --> 13:12.027
No, I do not.

13:14.897 --> 13:16.999
You are a mean little man.

13:18.534 --> 13:20.401
You'd think it'd be because
my parents didn't love me,

13:20.402 --> 13:22.570
but actually they
loved me a great deal.

13:24.105 --> 13:26.138
Bernie, it's not you.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.506
She's just set
in her ways.

13:28.507 --> 13:30.808
How can we be together
if the thought of us

13:30.809 --> 13:32.610
getting married
might kill your mother?

13:32.611 --> 13:36.615
It's the circle
of life, sweetie.

13:37.783 --> 13:42.419
One day our son will marry
someone and it will kill you.

13:44.389 --> 13:46.356
Howard, I have to go
to the bathroom

13:46.357 --> 13:47.790
and no one
will take me home.

13:47.791 --> 13:49.624
What's wrong with
the bathroom here?

13:49.625 --> 13:53.026
Pneumococcus, streptococcus,
staphylococcus

13:53.027 --> 13:55.328
and other assorted
coccuses.

13:55.329 --> 13:58.230
Sheldon, my mother is
on her deathbed

13:58.231 --> 14:00.299
and my fiancée is grief-stricken
over putting her there.

14:00.300 --> 14:01.934
I'm not taking you home.

14:01.935 --> 14:03.635
Will you at least

14:03.636 --> 14:05.002
go with me to the restroom here,

14:05.003 --> 14:07.138
so you can open the door
and flush the urinal?

14:07.139 --> 14:09.039
No!

14:09.040 --> 14:11.241
This might be a good time
to point out, Howard,

14:11.242 --> 14:13.710
that friendship requires
a certain give and take.

14:15.278 --> 14:16.545
Hold the door.

14:22.485 --> 14:24.452
Mr. Wolowitz?

14:24.453 --> 14:27.288
- Is she okay?
- It wasn't a heart attack.

14:27.289 --> 14:29.523
She's awake, she's
resting comfortably--

14:29.524 --> 14:30.723
we're still
running tests.

14:30.724 --> 14:31.724
Can I see her?

14:31.725 --> 14:34.094
Actually, she said,
and I quote,

14:34.095 --> 14:36.398
she'd "like to see the
little Catholic girl first."

14:38.571 --> 14:41.139
Me? Why me?

14:41.140 --> 14:42.607
Jews have been asking
that for centuries.

14:42.623 --> 14:44.891
There's no real good answer.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.813
Okay, well,
wish me luck.

14:49.814 --> 14:51.314
Don't worry,
you'll be fine.

14:51.315 --> 14:53.015
Let's just hide Mr. Cross.

14:53.016 --> 14:55.951
If it touches her, it burns.

14:59.255 --> 15:01.222
You brought a Catholic girl
home to your mother?

15:01.247 --> 15:02.447
Yeah.

15:02.715 --> 15:06.784
Why don't I write you a
prescription for Xanax.

15:10.698 --> 15:11.998
Finally.

15:25.844 --> 15:28.778
Oh, what fresh hell is this?

15:28.779 --> 15:31.514
Wait, you can't leave here,
you've been exposed.

15:33.550 --> 15:36.085
No, I haven't.

15:36.086 --> 15:38.954
It's all good.

15:40.556 --> 15:43.524
You want to talk
about crazy mothers,

15:43.525 --> 15:46.227
Leonard's mom wouldn't give him
any sort of approval growing up.

15:46.228 --> 15:47.661
Oh, the poor thing.

15:47.662 --> 15:49.930
It makes him desperate
to please women.

15:49.931 --> 15:52.133
That's why the foreplay
goes on and on.

15:52.134 --> 15:54.435
It does, doesn't it?

15:54.436 --> 15:56.971
It's like he's
trying to win a prize.

15:56.972 --> 15:58.572
A word of advice--
don't doze off.

15:58.573 --> 16:01.009
You will never hear
the end of it.

16:01.010 --> 16:02.844
Help me!

16:02.845 --> 16:04.578
Come back!

16:04.579 --> 16:05.944
Penny!

16:07.075 --> 16:10.209
There are a couple of
things I did with Penny

16:10.210 --> 16:11.576
that might be a
little silly, but...

16:11.577 --> 16:12.844
Like what?

16:12.845 --> 16:16.480
Every once in a while,
before we'd go to bed,

16:16.481 --> 16:19.416
I'd put on a little show
for her.

16:21.085 --> 16:23.186
What do you mean
"a show"?

16:23.187 --> 16:28.224
Well, you know,
the way I took my clothes off.

16:28.225 --> 16:30.525
Like, to music?

16:30.526 --> 16:35.396
I'd look pretty stupid
if there was no music.

16:35.397 --> 16:37.765
So you'd do
a striptease?

16:37.766 --> 16:41.568
I wasn't swinging
around a pole.

16:41.569 --> 16:43.870
Good, good.

16:45.339 --> 16:49.342
There was one time
I put body glitter on.

16:49.343 --> 16:52.011
Well, I don't think
you have to worry

16:52.012 --> 16:53.578
about Penny telling
my sister that.

16:53.579 --> 16:54.746
No, she wouldn't.

16:54.747 --> 16:58.115
Your big problem
is me telling her.

16:59.684 --> 17:02.252
You really are
a mean little man.

17:03.454 --> 17:06.088
Oh, God, that's so true.

17:06.089 --> 17:07.423
I know, right?

17:07.424 --> 17:09.825
Hey, what took
you guys so long?

17:09.826 --> 17:11.292
Oh, we were
just chatting.

17:11.294 --> 17:12.894
That's nice.
What about?

17:12.895 --> 17:14.295
We were just
comparing notes

17:14.296 --> 17:16.464
about how you are
in the sack.

17:18.767 --> 17:21.701
That's funny.
Yeah.

17:22.869 --> 17:24.771
What if she
wasn't kidding?

17:24.771 --> 17:26.571
It doesn't matter.

17:26.573 --> 17:28.407
I'm the king of foreplay.

17:32.012 --> 17:33.712
Hey, how'd it go?

17:33.713 --> 17:35.013
You're a putz.

17:35.882 --> 17:36.982
You know what that means?

17:36.983 --> 17:40.485
Yeah. Do you?

17:40.486 --> 17:42.653
Your mother just
taught it to me.

17:42.654 --> 17:44.921
She thinks she got food
poisoning from that deli

17:44.922 --> 17:47.391
and she just wanted
to make sure I was okay.

17:47.392 --> 17:49.025
And are you?

17:49.026 --> 17:52.462
No, because I'm
engaged to a putz.

17:54.398 --> 17:57.599
You let me believe I was the
reason she had a heart attack.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.934
Well, based on the
available evid--

17:58.935 --> 18:00.969
Shut up!

18:00.970 --> 18:02.336
She said I'm
a wonderful girl

18:02.337 --> 18:03.905
and that you're
lucky to have me.

18:03.906 --> 18:05.306
Where are you going?

18:05.307 --> 18:06.740
To the toilet!

18:06.741 --> 18:08.141
Is that okay with you?!

18:13.570 --> 18:19.174
Is it just me, or does she
sound sexy when she's angry?

18:26.679 --> 18:29.013
Mountain Elf.

18:32.591 --> 18:35.326
He takes the elf
from off the shelf.

18:36.361 --> 18:38.929
Hell Hounds.

18:38.930 --> 18:41.999
Hell Hounds-- who let
the Satanic dogs out?

18:42.000 --> 18:44.500
Who? Who-who?

18:46.003 --> 18:47.603
Colossal Serpent.

18:47.604 --> 18:50.939
I got a colossal
serpent right here.

18:53.109 --> 18:54.376
Must you?

18:54.377 --> 18:56.845
Sorry, I'm just trying
to cheer my buddy up.

18:58.113 --> 18:59.914
Rotting Zombie.

18:59.915 --> 19:02.916
Sheldon's new
Facebook photo.

19:06.920 --> 19:09.757
Zandor, Wizard of the North.

19:09.758 --> 19:11.492
Ha! I win.

19:11.493 --> 19:12.693
If you skip the part about being

19:12.694 --> 19:13.761
under a two-week quarantine
because you were exposed

19:13.762 --> 19:15.963
to a deadly disease--
absolutely.
