00:03.712 --> 00:07.674
<i>Previously on
American Rust...</i>

00:07.716 --> 00:09.676
<i>Thank you for taking me in.</i>

00:09.718 --> 00:10.677
<i>You can stay here</i>

00:10.719 --> 00:12.178
<i>as long as you need to.</i>

00:12.220 --> 00:13.972
<i>My son is gonna spend
the rest of his life</i>

00:14.014 --> 00:16.349
<i>in that prison,
and he's not gonna make it.</i>

00:16.391 --> 00:18.852
<i>Tomorrow, down that hallway.</i>

00:18.893 --> 00:20.687
<i>That's where
you're gonna take him out.</i>

00:20.729 --> 00:21.688
<i>He needs to cease</i>

00:21.730 --> 00:23.523
<i>existing.</i>

00:23.565 --> 00:26.359
<i>Nod twice to let me know
you understand your mission.</i>

00:28.278 --> 00:29.988
<i>Picked the wrong group
to fuck with, Poe.</i>

00:30.030 --> 00:31.656
<i>Good luck with the Aryans
when you get out of here.</i>

00:31.698 --> 00:34.200
<i>Wesley Ives? We'd like
to ask him a few questions.</i>

00:34.242 --> 00:36.870
<i>Well, he died. That Buick's
been sitting outside</i>

00:36.911 --> 00:38.580
<i>-since he passed.
-[Harris]</i> <i>Hi, Karl.</i>

00:38.621 --> 00:40.874
<i>-We thought we'd find you here.
- Oh. Right.</i>

00:40.915 --> 00:44.085
<i>Well, that's not mine, Harris.
I swear on my mother.</i>

00:44.127 --> 00:46.004
<i>I've been thinking a lot
about your brother.</i>

00:46.046 --> 00:47.672
<i>I made things tough for him.</i>

00:47.714 --> 00:49.382
<i>Maybe it's a good thing he left.</i>

00:49.424 --> 00:50.759
<i>And where's Billy now?</i>

00:50.800 --> 00:52.093
<i>He was charged with murder one,</i>

00:52.135 --> 00:53.428
<i>for the man I killed.</i>

00:53.470 --> 00:54.763
<i>I think he's giving up
his life for me.</i>

00:54.804 --> 00:55.889
<i>Seems like you have</i>

00:55.930 --> 00:57.849
<i>a big decision to make.</i>

01:00.018 --> 01:02.020
<i>I'll bet my flat, white ass</i>

01:02.062 --> 01:03.646
<i>that nimrod'll take</i>

01:03.688 --> 01:05.899
<i>a fucking deal from the D.A.
and rat us out.</i>

01:05.940 --> 01:07.817
<i>I know where he is.</i>

01:07.859 --> 01:09.569
<i>-That Bobby guy.
-[Grace]</i> <i>You found him?</i>

01:09.611 --> 01:10.570
<i>I know</i>

01:10.612 --> 01:11.905
<i>what has to be done.</i>

01:19.370 --> 01:22.540
<i>slow, eerie,
pulsating music</i>

01:28.421 --> 01:30.090
<i>You hanging in there?</i>

01:30.131 --> 01:32.258
A little lonely,
to tell you the truth.

01:33.676 --> 01:35.428
<i>I mean, she's a nice old lady,</i>

01:35.470 --> 01:37.097
<i>but she can't hear
a fucking thing</i>

01:37.138 --> 01:39.099
<i>so I'm yelling all the time.</i>

01:39.140 --> 01:41.601
<i>And I'm a gentle soul,
so it don't feel right.</i>

01:41.643 --> 01:43.686
<i>You'd shoot your sister
if you had to.</i>

01:44.854 --> 01:46.272
<i>I don't have a sister.</i>

01:46.314 --> 01:47.899
<i>No, I know. I'm just...</i>

01:47.941 --> 01:49.943
<i>-Look out, my friend.
- Oh, Jesus.</i>

01:49.984 --> 01:52.237
Set a few of those
out on the property

01:52.278 --> 01:54.739
<i>in case anyone comes
snooping around.</i>

01:54.781 --> 01:56.241
<i>I'll tell you the one person
who's been messing</i>

01:56.282 --> 01:57.784
<i>-with my equilibrium.
- Hmm?</i>

01:57.826 --> 02:00.286
<i>Jackson's such a pussy
the last few days.</i>

02:00.328 --> 02:02.205
<i>They'll never be able
to track it back</i>

02:02.247 --> 02:03.623
<i>to his piece-of-shit pharmacy.</i>

02:03.665 --> 02:05.959
<i>-That's right.
- I mean,</i>

02:06.000 --> 02:07.418
<i>you haven't been dealing lately?</i>

02:07.460 --> 02:08.795
<i>Nah, I'm keeping a low profile.</i>

02:08.837 --> 02:10.630
<i>Haven't sold anything in days,</i>

02:10.672 --> 02:12.715
<i>which sucks for my wallet,
but at least</i>

02:12.757 --> 02:14.425
<i>I don't have the cops knocking
on my door.</i>

02:14.467 --> 02:16.427
<i>Good. That's good.</i>

02:16.469 --> 02:18.805
<i>Man, I just pawned my watch.</i>

02:18.847 --> 02:20.557
<i>You know,
I'm sacrificing a whole hell</i>

02:20.598 --> 02:22.350
<i>of a lot,
just so that you could...</i>

02:30.358 --> 02:33.319
<i></i>

02:36.364 --> 02:38.533
<i></i>

02:52.881 --> 02:54.841
<i>soft, dramatic music</i>

03:24.746 --> 03:26.706
<i>Thanks.</i>

03:26.748 --> 03:28.708
<i>Don't get too comfortable.</i>

03:28.750 --> 03:30.376
<i>You go back out soon.</i>

03:30.418 --> 03:33.713
<i>-Back where?
- General population.</i>

03:35.840 --> 03:37.884
<i>Why?</i>

03:38.468 --> 03:40.762
<i>I thought I was supposed
to be here for at least a week.</i>

03:40.803 --> 03:42.513
<i>I'm just telling you
what I heard.</i>

03:42.555 --> 03:44.140
<i>You know it's not safe for me.</i>

03:48.269 --> 03:49.938
<i>Who makes the decision?</i>

03:49.979 --> 03:51.022
<i>In this place?</i>

03:51.064 --> 03:54.234
<i>Guards, inmates, the warden.</i>

03:54.275 --> 03:56.402
<i>It's hard to tell sometimes.</i>

03:56.444 --> 03:58.404
<i>Just know it's coming.</i>

03:58.446 --> 04:01.532
<i>slow, dramatic music</i>

05:09.684 --> 05:11.978
<i>Hey, Daddy?</i>

05:12.020 --> 05:14.522
<i>I have a bit of money
from selling the car.</i>

05:14.564 --> 05:18.651
<i>Not a huge amount, but enough
if we're careful with it.</i>

05:18.693 --> 05:22.780
<i>I'm ready to do what I should</i>

05:22.822 --> 05:25.116
<i>take care of my family.</i>

05:25.158 --> 05:27.827
<i>Maybe eventually
I'll enroll at Pitt Law,</i>

05:27.869 --> 05:30.330
<i>but for now, what I know is that</i>

05:30.371 --> 05:32.415
<i>this is the right place for me.</i>

05:33.791 --> 05:35.752
<i>This is home.</i>

05:35.793 --> 05:38.629
<i>Lee, this isn't what I meant
to happen.</i>

05:38.671 --> 05:40.340
<i>What does that mean?</i>

05:40.381 --> 05:43.634
<i>You made a whole life
for yourself on the East Coast.</i>

05:43.676 --> 05:46.179
<i>I didn't intend to drag you back
to Buell forever.</i>

05:46.220 --> 05:49.140
<i>You didn't drag me.
I came here because I wanted to.</i>

05:49.182 --> 05:51.142
<i>You came because I called you
in the middle of the night</i>

05:51.184 --> 05:53.227
<i>and told you to.</i>

05:54.520 --> 05:56.522
<i>Since you've been here,</i>

05:56.564 --> 06:00.193
<i>I'm seeing how hard
I push people</i>

06:00.234 --> 06:02.695
<i>to do what I want them to do.</i>

06:07.742 --> 06:10.703
<i>A month before your mother died,</i>

06:10.745 --> 06:13.414
<i>she told me she'd been dreaming</i>

06:13.456 --> 06:17.335
<i>about going back to Mexico</i>

06:17.377 --> 06:20.505
<i>after both you and Isaac left
for college.</i>

06:20.546 --> 06:24.717
<i>Just having these dreams,
over and over.</i>

06:24.759 --> 06:26.886
<i>You know what I did?</i>

06:26.928 --> 06:29.138
<i>I cut her out
of our bank account</i>

06:29.180 --> 06:32.058
<i>so she wouldn't take money
and run off.</i>

06:32.100 --> 06:36.062
<i>Started leaving her a few
dollars every day for groceries.</i>

06:36.104 --> 06:39.440
<i>Taking care of me
was killing your mother.</i>

06:41.776 --> 06:45.822
<i>I won't be responsible
for that happening to you.</i>

06:46.781 --> 06:48.741
<i>It isn't your decision.</i>

06:48.783 --> 06:50.743
<i>Maybe we've all had enough</i>

06:50.785 --> 06:53.913
<i>of you making decisions
for other people.</i>

06:59.419 --> 07:03.589
<i>I have spent so long
trying to figure out</i>

07:03.631 --> 07:05.716
<i>where I belong.</i>

07:07.468 --> 07:10.555
<i>I adapted, I contorted myself</i>

07:10.596 --> 07:13.516
<i>to fit in every place I went.</i>

07:13.558 --> 07:16.769
<i>In New York City,
in New Haven.</i>

07:19.772 --> 07:22.650
<i>Now I just want to be home</i>

07:22.692 --> 07:24.777
<i>and take care of my father.</i>

07:27.947 --> 07:30.074
<i>Why is that wrong?</i>

07:34.328 --> 07:36.289
<i>dramatic, pulsating music</i>

08:34.597 --> 08:36.682
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>

08:40.144 --> 08:42.355
<i>Got some, uh, new wheels?</i>

08:42.396 --> 08:44.482
<i>Yeah, I'm sick
of driving my truck everywhere.</i>

08:44.524 --> 08:46.484
<i>Found this old beauty,
couldn't resist.</i>

08:46.526 --> 08:48.569
<i>Let me buy you a drink.</i>

08:49.570 --> 08:51.614
<i>All right.</i>

09:05.378 --> 09:08.756
<i>It was basically a disaster
for me. Couldn't sit still.</i>

09:08.798 --> 09:11.092
<i>Joined the Army
as soon as I graduated.</i>

09:11.133 --> 09:13.219
<i>Bet it was a different story
for you.</i>

09:13.261 --> 09:15.888
<i>Even so, I remember a few things
from high school.</i>

09:15.930 --> 09:17.890
<i>Couple morsels of information</i>

09:17.932 --> 09:20.142
<i>lodged themselves one place
or another.</i>

09:20.184 --> 09:22.436
<i>Here's one--
tenth grade, all right?</i>

09:22.478 --> 09:25.231
<i>I remember one line
from one play.</i>

09:25.273 --> 09:26.691
<i>How about that? Huh?</i>

09:26.732 --> 09:28.276
<i>No idea which play,</i>

09:28.317 --> 09:29.902
<i>but I'll tell you something.
I like it,</i>

09:29.944 --> 09:31.445
<i>and I say it to myself
from time to time</i>

09:31.487 --> 09:33.197
<i>whenever something's screwed up.</i>

09:33.239 --> 09:35.533
<i>Actually, it was two lines.
One guy says to the other,</i>

09:35.575 --> 09:38.995
<i>he says,
"Something's rotten in..."</i>

09:39.036 --> 09:40.788
<i>Somewhere. I don't remember.</i>

09:40.830 --> 09:42.790
<i>Who the fuck knows?
But it was true.</i>

09:42.832 --> 09:44.709
<i>Something was rotten,
wherever they were.</i>

09:44.750 --> 09:48.087
<i>But you know what? What stuck
with me was the next line.</i>

09:48.129 --> 09:51.382
<i>The next guy says,
"Heaven will direct it."</i>

09:51.424 --> 09:55.011
<i>That line, that answer
has always comforted me.</i>

09:55.052 --> 09:57.513
<i>'Cause we're all going out of
our minds down here, you know?</i>

09:57.555 --> 09:59.724
<i>Trying to control things, you know?</i>

09:59.765 --> 10:02.101
<i>But at the end of the day,
God's got it taken care of.</i>

10:02.143 --> 10:04.937
<i>We can't help driving ourselves
crazy, you know?</i>

10:04.979 --> 10:08.024
<i>Trying to fix the rotten stuff,
trying to cut out the cancer.</i>

10:08.065 --> 10:11.944
<i>But Heaven's got a plan, and
we're all just carrying it out.</i>

10:11.986 --> 10:14.196
<i>I'm-I'm carrying it out.</i>

10:14.238 --> 10:16.866
<i>I'm carrying out God's plan.</i>

10:16.907 --> 10:18.284
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>

10:18.326 --> 10:20.286
<i>Denmark.</i>

10:20.328 --> 10:21.662
<i>What's that?</i>

10:21.704 --> 10:24.415
<i>Rotten in Denmark.</i>

10:24.457 --> 10:26.417
<i>You're right.
That's what it was.</i>

10:26.459 --> 10:28.669
<i>You clearly did better
in school than I did.</i>

10:28.711 --> 10:30.421
<i>Everybody did better
than you did, Chief.</i>

10:30.463 --> 10:33.341
<i>Ha! She's right.</i>

10:33.382 --> 10:35.009
<i>Mmm.</i>

10:35.051 --> 10:36.927
<i>-Del, are you feeling all right?
- Ah.</i>

10:36.969 --> 10:38.304
<i>I'm feeling great.
Why?</i>

10:38.346 --> 10:40.473
<i>Well, you seem
a little wound up.</i>

10:40.514 --> 10:42.266
<i>Seriously, going cold turkey,
dropping all your meds</i>

10:42.308 --> 10:43.851
<i>at once, that's-that's hard.</i>

10:43.893 --> 10:45.811
<i>I'm feeling great.
I'm doing God's work.</i>

10:45.853 --> 10:47.480
<i>That's what I'm saying.</i>

10:47.521 --> 10:49.190
<i>I shouldn't tell you this.</i>

10:50.191 --> 10:52.193
<i>Trent, the football player?</i>

10:52.234 --> 10:53.819
<i>Mm-hmm?</i>

10:53.861 --> 10:56.197
<i>His local dealer's starting
to spill.</i>

10:56.238 --> 10:59.200
<i>Which-- whoever gets the intel,</i>

10:59.241 --> 11:01.827
<i>me, the sheriff,
who fucking cares--</i>

11:01.869 --> 11:03.829
<i>but it's good for the community.</i>

11:03.871 --> 11:06.916
<i>Get to the bottom of this drug
dealing that's killing people.</i>

11:06.957 --> 11:11.045
<i>Make the arrests,
cut out the cancer. God's plan.</i>

11:13.005 --> 11:15.007
<i>You want another drink?</i>

11:15.049 --> 11:18.094
<i>Uh, no, no. I'm good. I--</i>

11:18.135 --> 11:20.346
<i>Come on!
Have another drink with me.</i>

11:20.388 --> 11:21.847
<i>Celebrate the downfall</i>

11:21.889 --> 11:24.016
<i>of illicit narcotics
in Fayette County.</i>

11:24.058 --> 11:25.685
<i>The brotherhood of man
pulling together</i>

11:25.726 --> 11:27.228
<i>-to cut out the rotten--</i>

11:27.269 --> 11:30.564
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

11:30.606 --> 11:33.651
<i>Excuse me a sec. Yeah?</i>

11:33.693 --> 11:36.028
<i>Steve, slow down.</i>

11:36.070 --> 11:37.530
<i>slow, dramatic music</i>

11:37.571 --> 11:41.075
<i>Are you sure?</i>

11:41.117 --> 11:44.870
<i>We got clearance
to cross state lines?</i>

11:44.912 --> 11:47.331
<i>All right,
I'm not in my truck. I...</i>

11:47.373 --> 11:49.083
<i>I'm coming anyways. Yeah.</i>

11:49.125 --> 11:50.835
<i>Sorry, bud.</i>

11:50.876 --> 11:53.045
<i>Could you cover the drinks
this time? I got to roll.</i>

11:53.087 --> 11:55.214
<i>-Mm-hmm.
- Rip out the cancer.</i>

11:55.256 --> 11:57.383
<i>Cut the whole thing out.</i>

12:10.229 --> 12:12.231
<i>slow, suspenseful music</i>

16:17.685 --> 16:19.311
<i>Glad to know you, Doctor.</i>

16:19.353 --> 16:21.230
<i>Well, what brings you here?</i>

16:21.271 --> 16:24.066
<i>[man]</i> <i>I'm curious about
Cannonball McKay and Clem Jones.</i>

16:24.108 --> 16:26.652
<i>[man 2]</i> <i>Reckon nobody
knows much about them, friend.</i>

16:26.694 --> 16:28.821
<i>Not even me,
and I'm Clem's doctor.</i>

16:28.862 --> 16:30.781
<i>Oh? Something wrong with him?</i>

16:30.823 --> 16:32.992
<i>Poor old fella has a bad arm.</i>

16:33.033 --> 16:35.327
<i>Hurt it years ago
in that stagecoach holdup</i>

16:35.369 --> 16:37.579
<i>-that sent him to jail.
-[man]</i> <i>I see.</i>

16:37.621 --> 16:40.165
<i>But if Cannonball's
as harmless as they say,</i>

16:40.207 --> 16:42.251
<i>why should he take
in an ex-convict as a partner?</i>

16:42.292 --> 16:44.503
<i>[man 2]</i> <i>That's something
we'd all like to know,</i>

16:44.545 --> 16:46.839
<i>but Cannonball won't talk.</i>

16:46.880 --> 16:48.799
<i>[man]</i> <i>Marshal, I'd like
a closer look at those two.</i>

16:50.551 --> 16:52.678
<i>[man 2]</i> <i>The stage is due in
any minute now.</i>

16:52.720 --> 16:54.847
<i>-[man 2]</i> <i>So long.
-[man]</i> <i>Fine.</i>

16:58.225 --> 16:59.893
<i>Hurry up, Collins.</i>

16:59.935 --> 17:01.687
<i>I got to shove on to Rustfield
in ten minutes.</i>

17:01.729 --> 17:03.731
<i>[man 3]</i> <i>You're not shoving on
to anywhere, Cannonball.</i>

17:03.772 --> 17:06.191
<i>What do you mean? My contract
with Wells Fargo's still good.</i>

17:06.233 --> 17:07.818
<i>Pulling out of here on schedule.</i>

17:07.860 --> 17:09.570
<i>No, you're not.
Wells Fargo's not gonna lose</i>

17:09.611 --> 17:11.530
<i>any shipments if I can help it.</i>

17:11.572 --> 17:13.365
<i>Well, I never lost them a
shipment of gold yet, have I?</i>

17:13.407 --> 17:14.742
<i>[man 3]</i> <i>No, but you never had
a crook working for you.</i>

17:14.783 --> 17:16.535
<i>Not until now.</i>

17:16.577 --> 17:18.037
<i>[man 4]</i> <i>Nobody's gonna call me
a crook again.</i>

17:18.078 --> 17:19.121
<i>Oh, no?</i>

17:20.789 --> 17:22.499
<i>...the last shot
you'll ever fire.</i>

17:22.541 --> 17:24.168
<i>Put up your gun.</i>

17:24.209 --> 17:26.336
<i></i>

17:41.769 --> 17:44.605
<i></i>

17:46.023 --> 17:48.984
<i></i>

17:50.736 --> 17:53.238
<i>dramatic, suspenseful music</i>

18:41.829 --> 18:44.998
<i>Okay, now. Let's not--</i>

19:00.097 --> 19:02.599
<i>somber, dramatic music</i>

19:58.739 --> 20:01.116
<i>Okay.</i>

20:01.158 --> 20:02.784
<i>Ow.</i>

20:50.624 --> 20:54.336
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

20:54.378 --> 20:57.005
<i>Hello? 911.
What's your emergency?</i>

20:57.047 --> 20:59.341
<i>Hello?</i>

21:03.470 --> 21:06.098
<i>quiet, eerie music</i>

21:15.315 --> 21:17.276
<i>pulsing, dramatic music</i>

21:52.728 --> 21:54.688
<i>intriguing, dramatic music</i>

22:37.898 --> 22:39.191
<i>Ow.</i>

22:53.622 --> 22:55.749
<i>Fuck.</i>

24:43.607 --> 24:45.817
<i>Is it done?</i>

24:50.155 --> 24:52.115
<i>I'm almost finished.</i>

24:53.533 --> 24:55.785
<i>Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.</i>

24:55.827 --> 24:58.997
<i>-Just a few more,</i>

24:59.039 --> 25:00.999
<i>and...</i>

25:01.041 --> 25:03.293
<i>what's done is done.</i>

25:09.341 --> 25:12.802
<i>Do you want to tell me
how you got shot?</i>

25:12.844 --> 25:15.514
<i>I can't talk about it.</i>

25:15.555 --> 25:17.891
<i>It's okay. You don't have to.</i>

25:17.933 --> 25:19.851
<i>So long as no one saw,</i>

25:19.893 --> 25:21.978
<i>-no one will know.</i>

25:22.020 --> 25:23.522
<i>No one saw.</i>

25:25.565 --> 25:27.234
<i>Good.</i>

25:28.318 --> 25:31.154
<i></i>

25:31.196 --> 25:34.991
<i>I picked up your phone
from the ash can.</i>

25:35.033 --> 25:36.535
<i>Brought it back here.
It's been on</i>

25:36.576 --> 25:38.245
<i>and charging all night.</i>

25:39.579 --> 25:41.540
<i></i>

25:41.581 --> 25:44.793
<i>It'll show the one call from me</i>

25:44.834 --> 25:47.212
<i>while you were at the bar</i>

25:47.254 --> 25:50.715
<i>and then you staying at the bar
for a bit</i>

25:50.757 --> 25:53.718
<i>and then the phone
traveling back here</i>

25:53.760 --> 25:55.887
<i>to the cabin.</i>

25:59.975 --> 26:02.769
<i>I think
I need to sew that one up.</i>

26:04.604 --> 26:06.356
<i>And soon enough,</i>

26:06.398 --> 26:08.358
<i>when they identify</i>

26:08.400 --> 26:10.485
<i>the dealer</i>

26:10.527 --> 26:12.571
<i>that named Billy,</i>

26:12.612 --> 26:14.489
<i>the case is gonna fall apart.</i>

26:14.531 --> 26:16.741
<i>Two dealers gone.</i>

26:16.783 --> 26:18.868
<i>And my son is free.</i>

26:18.910 --> 26:20.662
<i>All 'cause of you.</i>

26:20.704 --> 26:23.373
<i>Take a long drink, baby.</i>

26:28.587 --> 26:30.463
<i>That's good. Take another one.</i>

26:35.051 --> 26:37.721
<i>There is a balance</i>

26:37.762 --> 26:40.890
<i>between good and evil
in the world.</i>

26:40.932 --> 26:42.892
<i>gentle, dramatic music</i>

26:42.934 --> 26:45.437
<i>Tonight,</i>

26:45.478 --> 26:49.107
<i>that balance just shifted
a little more towards good.</i>

26:49.983 --> 26:52.444
<i>You bring good
into the world, Del.</i>

28:43.930 --> 28:45.974
<i></i>

28:47.767 --> 28:49.811
<i></i>

29:03.950 --> 29:05.910
<i>Watch your step.</i>

29:11.166 --> 29:13.418
<i>-Hey.
- Hey, buddy.</i>

29:26.264 --> 29:27.682
<i>Open nine.</i>

29:27.724 --> 29:30.602
<i>-Copy.</i>

29:33.146 --> 29:35.565
<i>Up. Let's go.</i>

29:35.607 --> 29:37.275
<i>Back with everybody else.</i>

29:39.611 --> 29:41.571
<i>Come on, it's time to go.</i>

29:44.616 --> 29:46.367
<i>I'm not gonna resist.</i>

29:46.409 --> 29:49.120
<i>No, you're not.</i>

29:49.162 --> 29:51.456
<i>All I ask
is you deliver one message</i>

29:51.498 --> 29:53.249
<i>-for me.
- I don't do that kind of thing.</i>

29:53.291 --> 29:56.127
<i>To a woman named LeeAnn English.</i>

29:56.169 --> 29:57.962
<i>Just do it.</i>

29:58.004 --> 29:59.923
<i>If something bad happens to me,</i>

29:59.964 --> 30:01.633
<i>deliver the message.</i>

30:01.674 --> 30:03.426
<i>She works
with the public defender</i>

30:03.468 --> 30:04.636
<i>I got assigned.</i>

30:04.677 --> 30:07.639
<i></i>

30:07.680 --> 30:10.308
<i>"I kept my promise."</i>

30:14.646 --> 30:16.606
<i>tense, dramatic music</i>

30:20.735 --> 30:22.487
<i>Close nine.</i>

30:29.077 --> 30:30.829
<i>He's all yours.</i>

30:30.870 --> 30:33.039
<i>General population.</i>

30:46.386 --> 30:49.222
<i>All right, Dad,
I have to get going.</i>

30:49.264 --> 30:51.850
<i>After work, I'll get something
to cook for dinner.</i>

30:51.891 --> 30:54.686
<i>-Pork chops okay?
- Sure.</i>

30:54.727 --> 30:58.439
<i>With string beans or broccoli?</i>

30:58.481 --> 31:00.191
<i>Or just a salad, maybe?</i>

31:00.233 --> 31:02.235
<i>Your choice.</i>

31:08.700 --> 31:11.202
<i>We got a whole routine
going here.</i>

31:11.244 --> 31:13.246
<i>Routine's the way
to get things done.</i>

31:16.207 --> 31:17.542
<i>Don't get into any trouble.</i>

31:17.584 --> 31:20.086
<i>-Not me.</i>

31:25.091 --> 31:27.218
<i>[newswoman]</i> <i>Officers
uncovered a triple homicide...</i>

31:27.260 --> 31:29.762
<i>-Morning.
Hey.</i>

31:29.804 --> 31:31.389
<i>-You seen this?
-...southeast of Morgantown.</i>

31:31.431 --> 31:33.057
<i>Local police</i>

31:33.099 --> 31:34.893
<i>aren't releasing names
as of yet, but...</i>

31:34.934 --> 31:36.436
<i>Hold on...</i>

31:36.477 --> 31:38.438
<i>Just getting this.</i>

31:40.940 --> 31:43.776
<i>Okay.
So, now police are saying</i>

31:43.818 --> 31:46.529
<i>another body has been found
on the property.</i>

31:52.952 --> 31:55.121
Ow.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.759
<i>It's gonna be a good day.</i>

32:08.760 --> 32:10.678
<i>Maybe it will be.</i>

32:10.720 --> 32:12.597
<i>It will be.</i>

32:12.639 --> 32:14.682
<i>Call me if you hear anything.</i>

32:18.561 --> 32:20.855
<i>[Frank]</i> <i>They're gonna
release names in an hour.</i>

32:20.897 --> 32:23.232
<i>What you need to know is
we finally got a positive ID</i>

32:23.274 --> 32:25.944
<i>for our anonymous witness.
Robert Lord.</i>

32:25.985 --> 32:28.112
<i>Turns out
there was a good reason</i>

32:28.154 --> 32:29.781
<i>people called him Jesus.</i>

32:29.822 --> 32:32.450
Aside from the beard
and the long hair.

32:32.492 --> 32:34.494
<i>Is that your punch line?</i>

32:34.535 --> 32:36.621
<i>The punch line is he's dead.</i>

32:38.998 --> 32:40.792
<i>Punch line number two...</i>

32:40.833 --> 32:43.795
<i>Jackson Berg,
the pharmacist in Buell?</i>

32:43.836 --> 32:45.463
<i>He's dead, too.</i>

32:45.505 --> 32:47.256
<i>Looks like they shot each other.</i>

32:47.298 --> 32:48.841
<i>Now,</i>

32:48.883 --> 32:51.636
<i>maybe it was a lovers' quarrel,
but more likely,</i>

32:51.678 --> 32:53.972
<i>Jackson was supplying
to Lord Jesus,</i>

32:54.013 --> 32:55.974
<i>and they had
somewhat of a disagreement.</i>

32:56.015 --> 32:59.185
<i>And get this.
Jackson's second cousin,</i>

32:59.227 --> 33:01.646
<i>87-year-old woman
who owned the cabin?</i>

33:01.688 --> 33:03.231
<i>She's also dead.</i>

33:03.272 --> 33:06.150
<i>She was clutching
a pump-action shotgun</i>

33:06.192 --> 33:08.486
<i>when one of them popped her
clean through the chest.</i>

33:08.528 --> 33:11.489
<i>Hope she got a shot off.</i>

33:11.531 --> 33:13.449
<i>I can find that out for you.</i>

33:13.491 --> 33:15.451
<i>Wouldn't be the worst way to go.</i>

33:15.493 --> 33:17.161
<i>In a shootout,
holding your rifle.</i>

33:17.203 --> 33:19.163
<i>Given all the other possibilities.</i>

33:19.205 --> 33:20.665
<i>That's one way of looking at it.</i>

33:20.707 --> 33:23.167
<i>Projecting ahead
to when I'm 87.</i>

33:23.209 --> 33:24.502
<i>That's what you want,
I hope you get your wish.</i>

33:24.544 --> 33:26.504
<i>But another way
of looking at it, Frank,</i>

33:26.546 --> 33:28.673
<i>is it would have been
extremely fucking swell</i>

33:28.715 --> 33:31.009
<i>for the county sheriff to have
tracked down our star witness</i>

33:31.050 --> 33:33.302
<i>-before
the local pharmacist did.
- All right, Sue.</i>

33:33.344 --> 33:34.595
<i>But let's you and me</i>

33:34.637 --> 33:36.347
<i>just concentrate on next steps.</i>

33:36.389 --> 33:37.682
<i>The next step is I probably need
to get on the judge's docket</i>

33:37.724 --> 33:39.809
<i>to discuss releasing Billy Poe.</i>

33:39.851 --> 33:41.477
<i>I've got no case
against him now.</i>

33:41.519 --> 33:43.479
<i>I don't like it
any more than you do.</i>

33:43.521 --> 33:45.231
<i>Is that right? Because
I've been under the impression</i>

33:45.273 --> 33:47.191
<i>that you haven't been fully
on board this one from the jump.</i>

33:47.233 --> 33:49.068
<i>You're right. I haven't been.</i>

33:49.110 --> 33:50.903
<i>I thought
you went after Poe too early.</i>

33:50.945 --> 33:52.989
<i>I told you that at the time,</i>

33:53.031 --> 33:56.034
<i>but you dragged me into this,
and I am deep in now.</i>

33:56.075 --> 33:58.411
<i>I booked him. You charged him.</i>

33:58.453 --> 34:00.038
<i>I find the notion
of just letting him go</i>

34:00.079 --> 34:01.664
<i>truly fucking embarrassing,</i>

34:01.706 --> 34:03.249
<i>so thank you for that.</i>

34:03.291 --> 34:05.251
<i>ominous, dramatic music</i>

34:23.728 --> 34:25.772
<i></i>

35:12.068 --> 35:13.361
<i>Yeah, hit him. Come on.</i>

35:22.495 --> 35:23.913
<i>You seen this?</i>

35:25.581 --> 35:27.625
<i>If you're talking
about the West Virginia thing,</i>

35:27.667 --> 35:30.461
<i>I heard it on the radio. Steve.</i>

35:31.420 --> 35:32.964
<i>Boss.</i>

35:38.136 --> 35:39.470
<i>-You okay there?
Ah,</i>

35:39.512 --> 35:40.638
<i>-slept the wrong way.</i>

35:40.680 --> 35:41.806
<i>You know you're getting old</i>

35:41.848 --> 35:43.641
<i>when you injure yourself
sleeping.</i>

35:43.683 --> 35:45.726
<i>Oh, Chief.</i>

35:45.768 --> 35:47.770
<i>You got a visitor
in your office.</i>

35:47.812 --> 35:49.480
<i>Who?</i>

35:49.522 --> 35:52.608
<i>Virgil Poe. Said he had
something important to tell you.</i>

35:52.650 --> 35:54.485
<i>Thought I'd let him wait
for you inside.</i>

35:54.527 --> 35:56.487
<i>Next time, don't do that.</i>

35:56.529 --> 35:58.781
<i>Sorry.</i>

36:01.033 --> 36:02.994
<i>[TV continues indistinctly</i>

36:10.251 --> 36:12.044
<i>Del Harris.</i>

36:13.004 --> 36:14.630
<i>Good of you to see me.</i>

36:14.672 --> 36:18.134
<i>Well, not sure
I had much of a choice, but...</i>

36:18.176 --> 36:20.219
<i>always a pleasure.</i>

36:20.261 --> 36:21.888
<i>-You all right there?</i>

36:21.929 --> 36:24.265
<i>I'm fine.</i>

36:24.307 --> 36:26.642
<i>Threw your back out
doing something acrobatic?</i>

36:26.684 --> 36:28.644
<i>-What can I do for you?</i>

36:28.686 --> 36:30.688
<i>Well, to tell you the truth,
Chief,</i>

36:30.730 --> 36:32.857
<i>I've been feeling pretty bad
about the last couple times</i>

36:32.899 --> 36:34.358
<i>we've seen each other.</i>

36:34.400 --> 36:36.360
<i>In particular, that time
that we hung out together</i>

36:36.402 --> 36:38.029
<i>at your cabin.</i>

36:38.070 --> 36:40.990
<i>You know, that I might not
have been at my best.</i>

36:41.032 --> 36:43.367
<i>And I think it's important
to name your faults, you know?</i>

36:43.409 --> 36:45.703
<i>Otherwise, you can't fix 'em.</i>

36:45.745 --> 36:48.456
<i>So, I lashed out.</i>

36:48.497 --> 36:50.291
<i>I spoke in anger.</i>

36:50.333 --> 36:52.001
<i>Took my beers back home with me.</i>

36:52.043 --> 36:53.961
<i>It wasn't a good look,
and I'm not too proud of that.</i>

36:54.003 --> 36:55.963
<i>Well, I appreciate that.</i>

36:56.005 --> 36:58.007
<i>It's kind of you to stop in
and tell me.</i>

36:58.049 --> 37:01.093
<i>Hey, you know what I've been
doing a lot of lately?</i>

37:01.135 --> 37:03.679
<i>Yogi meditation.</i>

37:03.721 --> 37:05.681
<i>Mm. The Indian kind.</i>

37:05.723 --> 37:06.766
<i>The real deal.</i>

37:06.807 --> 37:08.517
<i>You breathe deep,</i>

37:08.559 --> 37:10.019
<i>let your mind investigate.</i>

37:10.061 --> 37:11.979
<i>Surreal.
It's a beautiful process.</i>

37:12.021 --> 37:13.356
<i>You know what I'm talking about?</i>

37:13.397 --> 37:14.857
<i>-Not so much.
- Well, let me give you</i>

37:14.899 --> 37:17.526
<i>an example then, man.
Like, earlier today,</i>

37:17.568 --> 37:20.154
<i>I'm walking around
our-our property--</i>

37:20.196 --> 37:22.156
<i>mine and Grace's-- 'cause,
you know, I'm just trying</i>

37:22.198 --> 37:23.908
<i>to personally investigate
what I might've done</i>

37:23.950 --> 37:26.452
<i>to contribute
to our current situation, right?</i>

37:26.494 --> 37:28.955
<i>I mean, our son's in jail.</i>

37:28.996 --> 37:31.082
<i>Our home's burned down.</i>

37:31.123 --> 37:33.584
<i>I believe we all bear a certain
responsibility, you know?</i>

37:33.626 --> 37:35.044
<i>So I'm...</i>

37:35.086 --> 37:37.088
<i>I'm just walking
through the ashes, you know?</i>

37:37.129 --> 37:39.090
<i>I'm breathing and thinking,</i>

37:39.131 --> 37:43.094
<i>just, you know,
running things over in my mind.</i>

37:43.135 --> 37:45.930
<i>And, suddenly, out of nowhere,</i>

37:45.972 --> 37:49.600
<i>I get this flash of inspiration
that I ought to turn around.</i>

37:49.642 --> 37:51.352
<i>So I do.</i>

37:51.394 --> 37:52.812
<i>And what do I see?</i>

37:53.813 --> 37:55.564
<i>Our tool shed,</i>

37:55.606 --> 37:57.066
<i>still standing there.</i>

37:57.108 --> 37:59.110
<i>Untouched by the flames.</i>

37:59.151 --> 38:00.611
<i>That's a lucky thing, right?</i>

38:00.653 --> 38:02.530
<i>At least something remains.</i>

38:02.571 --> 38:04.490
<i>So I'm feeling good in that,
you know?</i>

38:04.532 --> 38:06.701
<i>I'm-- I-I go over to it.
I open it up.</i>

38:06.742 --> 38:09.036
<i>I look inside and...</i>

38:09.078 --> 38:11.789
<i>Looking at my tools and
some of 'em are in good shape</i>

38:11.831 --> 38:14.458
<i>and I'm j-- I'm happy that
they're still there, you know?</i>

38:14.500 --> 38:17.461
<i>And-and I look over on the shelf</i>

38:17.503 --> 38:20.381
<i>and I see my son's old gym bag.</i>

38:20.423 --> 38:21.924
<i>-This one,</i>

38:21.966 --> 38:23.342
<i>right here.</i>

38:23.384 --> 38:24.760
<i>That's another good thing.</i>

38:24.802 --> 38:26.262
<i>Billy's bag, you know?</i>

38:26.304 --> 38:30.474
<i>So I-I take it down
and-and I open it up.</i>

38:30.516 --> 38:32.601
<i>And, lo and behold,</i>

38:32.643 --> 38:34.603
<i>there's all these pictures
in there.</i>

38:34.645 --> 38:37.815
<i>Look at that. Snapshots of Billy
when he was younger.</i>

38:38.858 --> 38:40.484
<i>Yeah. Now, mind you,</i>

38:40.526 --> 38:42.737
<i>these were hung all over
the walls of our trailer</i>

38:42.778 --> 38:45.906
<i>before it so tragically burnt
to the ground. And...</i>

38:45.948 --> 38:47.825
<i>and these here...</i>

38:49.618 --> 38:52.330
<i>Yeah. Those were stuck
on the refrigerator</i>

38:52.371 --> 38:54.832
<i>for... years.</i>

38:54.874 --> 38:57.960
<i>You know? One of those
pretty little magnet things.</i>

38:58.002 --> 38:59.837
<i>I don't know.
I'm feeling blessed.</i>

38:59.879 --> 39:02.089
I do not know
who packed this shit up

39:02.131 --> 39:04.925
<i>before our place burned down,
but somebody did.</i>

39:04.967 --> 39:07.136
<i>And I am grateful.</i>

39:07.178 --> 39:09.138
<i>See where I'm going with this?</i>

39:09.180 --> 39:10.973
<i>Oh, fuck, I almost forgot.</i>

39:11.015 --> 39:13.976
<i>Yeah, we always have, like,
three, four cans of kerosene</i>

39:14.018 --> 39:14.977
<i>in that shed.</i>

39:15.019 --> 39:16.354
<i>You know, for emergencies.</i>

39:16.395 --> 39:18.022
<i>In case
we can't pay the power bill</i>

39:18.064 --> 39:20.191
<i>and the lights go out.</i>

39:20.232 --> 39:23.861
<i>Well, there was
only one empty can in there.</i>

39:25.071 --> 39:28.324
<i>And I don't know why or
what the hell it got used for,</i>

39:28.366 --> 39:30.576
<i>but, uh...</i>

39:30.618 --> 39:33.204
<i>it's an interesting question
to ponder, don't you think?</i>

39:34.205 --> 39:35.748
<i>Feel free to leave all this here</i>

39:35.790 --> 39:37.166
<i>if you'd like me
to look into it.</i>

39:37.208 --> 39:38.167
<i>Thank you.</i>

39:38.209 --> 39:40.086
<i>So nice of you.</i>

39:40.127 --> 39:41.670
<i>Yeah, thanks. But no.</i>

39:41.712 --> 39:43.089
<i>I'm, uh...</i>

39:44.757 --> 39:47.218
<i>I think
they're gonna give me comfort</i>

39:47.259 --> 39:49.678
<i>in any rough times ahead.</i>

39:52.431 --> 39:54.558
<i>I think us men ought to really</i>

39:54.600 --> 39:56.560
<i>look out for one another,
you know?</i>

39:56.602 --> 39:59.021
<i>Like, let them know
when maybe they got a wild one</i>

39:59.063 --> 40:00.523
<i>on their hands?</i>

40:00.564 --> 40:02.358
<i>'Cause gentlemen like us,</i>

40:02.400 --> 40:04.735
<i>we could tend to think
we done something special--</i>

40:04.777 --> 40:07.530
<i>or, worse, we</i> <i>are
something special--</i>

40:07.571 --> 40:10.908
<i>to deserve the attentions
of a particular female.</i>

40:10.950 --> 40:14.245
<i>When in reality, if we
just breathe deep and ponder,</i>

40:14.286 --> 40:16.789
<i>we'll see we're getting
all used up.</i>

40:17.957 --> 40:20.209
<i>You take care, Chief.</i>

40:21.127 --> 40:22.962

<i>She's not in right now.</i>

40:36.350 --> 40:37.977
<i>Can I take a message?</i>

40:41.313 --> 40:43.357
<i>This is LeeAnn English.</i>

40:49.029 --> 40:51.949
<i>I'm sorry,
who is the message from?</i>

40:51.991 --> 40:53.951
<i>gentle, somber music</i>

42:52.945 --> 42:54.905
<i>low, tense music</i>

<i>Sheriff.</i>

43:46.332 --> 43:47.625
<i>How you doing, sir?</i>

43:47.666 --> 43:49.001
<i>-All right.</i>

43:49.043 --> 43:50.753
<i>Can you open it for me?</i>

43:52.796 --> 43:55.966
<i>I need to take
one more look around.</i>

43:56.008 --> 43:57.968
<i>low, tense music</i>

44:15.611 --> 44:17.404
<i>Yeah.</i>

44:17.446 --> 44:19.239
<i>You have some visitors.</i>

44:19.281 --> 44:21.325
<i>Can I ask who?</i>

44:21.367 --> 44:23.661
<i>Detectives down from Pittsburgh.</i>

44:25.704 --> 44:26.997
<i>What do they want?</i>

44:27.039 --> 44:29.166
<i>They didn't say.</i>

44:29.208 --> 44:30.959
<i>All right.</i>

44:31.001 --> 44:32.670
<i>Show 'em in.</i>

44:40.886 --> 44:42.971
<i>Del Harris?</i>

44:43.013 --> 44:45.182
<i>-Yeah.
- You have some time to talk?</i>

44:45.224 --> 44:47.518
<i>I think I could spare
a couple minutes.</i>

44:47.559 --> 44:49.061
<i>Uh, this is Detective Munson.</i>

44:49.103 --> 44:50.396
<i>Hey.</i>

44:50.437 --> 44:51.855
<i>And I'm Detective Fisher.</i>

44:51.897 --> 44:53.399
<i>We'd like to ask you
some questions.</i>

44:53.440 --> 44:54.858
<i>You want to tell me what about?</i>

44:54.900 --> 44:57.569
<i>Your former partner,
Chuck Castellanos.</i>

44:58.779 --> 45:00.239
<i>Mind if I close this?</i>

45:00.280 --> 45:02.032
<i>If you like.</i>

45:04.952 --> 45:06.995
<i>Chief Harper still running
things into the ground</i>

45:07.037 --> 45:09.206
<i>-over there?
No. He was all right.</i>

45:09.248 --> 45:10.374
<i>Retired last year.</i>

45:10.416 --> 45:11.542
<i>Did he?</i>

45:11.583 --> 45:12.835
<i>May we sit?</i>

45:12.876 --> 45:14.128
<i>Sure. Yeah.</i>

45:14.169 --> 45:16.130
<i>I'm wondering if you know</i>

45:16.171 --> 45:19.049
<i>what Detective Castellanos
has been up to lately.</i>

45:19.091 --> 45:20.509
<i>What's he been up to?</i>

45:20.551 --> 45:22.469
<i>I think he's been up to dying.</i>

45:22.511 --> 45:23.887
<i>I read the newspaper,</i>

45:23.929 --> 45:26.014
<i>so I know what's been reported.</i>

45:26.056 --> 45:28.016
<i>Reported about Detective Castellanos.</i>

45:28.058 --> 45:30.018
<i>-Right.
- Got it.</i>

45:30.060 --> 45:31.520
<i>So that's
where you first learned</i>

45:31.562 --> 45:33.021
<i>about Detective Castellanos'
death?</i>

45:33.063 --> 45:34.231
<i>Correct.</i>

45:34.273 --> 45:35.649
<i>Can I ask which newspaper?</i>

45:35.691 --> 45:37.025
<i>Post-Gazette.</i>

45:37.067 --> 45:38.152
<i>You get that delivered?</i>

45:39.194 --> 45:41.071
<i>I live pretty far up
a dirt road,</i>

45:41.113 --> 45:43.198
<i>so I tend to pick it up
when I'm out and about.</i>

45:43.240 --> 45:44.366
<i>Here, in Buell?</i>

45:44.408 --> 45:45.701
<i>That's right.</i>

45:45.743 --> 45:48.829
<i>Or in Brownsville.</i>

46:00.966 --> 46:02.843
<i>low, mysterious music</i>

47:00.359 --> 47:01.860
<i>Internal organ damage,</i>

47:01.902 --> 47:03.487
<i>broken ribs, skull fracture,</i>

47:03.529 --> 47:05.155
<i>-cerebral edema.
- What is that?</i>

47:05.197 --> 47:06.573
<i>Brain swelling.</i>

47:06.615 --> 47:08.534
<i>Your son is in
a medically induced coma</i>

47:08.575 --> 47:10.285
<i>while we monitor him and try
to get the swelling down.</i>

47:10.327 --> 47:13.038
<i>But when it comes down,
he'll be okay?</i>

47:13.080 --> 47:15.040
<i>We hope.
It's still too early to tell</i>

47:15.082 --> 47:17.835
<i>whether he sustained
any long-term brain injuries.</i>

47:18.460 --> 47:21.171
<i>Officer, this is Grace Poe.
She'd like to see her son.</i>

47:22.214 --> 47:24.341
<i>Go ahead.</i>

47:28.929 --> 47:30.681
<i>Is that really necessary?</i>

47:30.722 --> 47:33.350
I'm sorry. It's standard
for prison inmates.

47:33.392 --> 47:34.935
<i>He's not a fucking inmate.</i>

47:36.979 --> 47:39.273
<i>He was awaiting trial.</i>

47:39.314 --> 47:41.733
<i>I'll give you a minute alone.</i>

47:48.198 --> 47:50.158
<i>gentle, somber music</i>

48:05.591 --> 48:07.759
<i>It's okay.</i>

48:13.891 --> 48:16.560
<i>Sweet boy, it's gonna be okay.</i>

48:20.063 --> 48:23.025
<i>You'll be home with me soon.</i>

48:26.194 --> 48:28.071
<i>Just hang on.</i>

48:42.753 --> 48:44.087
<i>Dad?</i>

48:44.129 --> 48:45.756
<i>I'm home.</i>

49:15.577 --> 49:17.329
<i>Are you in there?</i>

49:22.125 --> 49:23.794
<i>Dad?</i>

49:55.867 --> 49:57.786
<i>Oh, God.</i>

50:24.062 --> 50:25.689
<i>Can I bum one of those?</i>

50:26.606 --> 50:28.025
<i>Yeah.</i>

50:29.067 --> 50:30.610
<i>There you go.</i>

50:39.745 --> 50:41.747
<i>You live here?</i>

50:41.788 --> 50:43.415
<i>Yeah.</i>

50:43.457 --> 50:45.250
<i>Huh.</i>

50:45.292 --> 50:47.252
<i>soft, somber music</i>

50:56.803 --> 50:58.138
<i>You hadn't seen</i>

50:58.180 --> 50:59.306
<i>Detective Castellanos
in a while.</i>

50:59.347 --> 51:00.599
<i>That's right.</i>

51:00.640 --> 51:01.725
<i>How long, you think?</i>

51:01.767 --> 51:04.186
<i>Long time. Close to a decade.</i>

51:04.227 --> 51:05.729
<i>I remember having a beer
with him</i>

51:05.771 --> 51:08.398
<i>maybe six months
after I left Pittsburgh.</i>

51:08.440 --> 51:10.525
<i>-And that was ten years.
- Right.</i>

51:10.567 --> 51:13.361
<i>His recent cell records
show several calls to you.</i>

51:13.403 --> 51:14.571
<i>Do they?</i>

51:14.613 --> 51:17.407
<i>-That's right.
- Interesting.</i>

51:17.449 --> 51:20.410
<i>'Cause I got some calls
from a Pittsburgh number</i>

51:20.452 --> 51:22.162
<i>but never any message.</i>

51:22.204 --> 51:23.413
<i>What was the number?</i>

51:23.455 --> 51:25.582
<i>It just said "Pittsburgh, PA."</i>

51:25.624 --> 51:28.418
<i>If that was Chuck,
you'll see the calls were short.</i>

51:28.460 --> 51:32.964
<i>He must've hung up as soon
as he went to voice mail.</i>

51:34.925 --> 51:37.260
Any idea
what he was calling you about?

51:37.302 --> 51:39.888
<i>Like I said,
he never left a message.</i>

51:41.807 --> 51:43.141
<i>Any guesses?</i>

51:43.183 --> 51:45.602
<i>I don't like to guess.</i>

52:52.711 --> 52:54.462
<i>Why?</i>

52:56.047 --> 52:57.340
<i>Pick it up.</i>

52:57.382 --> 53:00.051
<i>Put it back in your pocket.</i>
