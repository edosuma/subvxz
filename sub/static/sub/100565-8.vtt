WEBVTT

00:01.088 --> 00:02.915
How long are we
supposed to wait...

00:04.656 --> 00:06.745
to feel comfortable
with women having power?

00:09.096 --> 00:11.359
How much time do we give peopleto adapt to change?

00:37.994 --> 00:40.997
"The falcon cannot
hear the falconer.

00:45.219 --> 00:46.829
"Things fall apart...

00:51.138 --> 00:53.140
"the center cannot hold.

01:00.190 --> 01:02.540
"The best
lack all conviction...

01:07.850 --> 01:10.983
"the worst are full
of passionate intensity.

01:16.032 --> 01:19.253
"What rough beast,

01:19.296 --> 01:21.994
"its hour come round at last...

01:24.214 --> 01:26.782
"Slouches towards Bethlehem

01:29.176 --> 01:31.091
to be born?"

03:43.310 --> 03:45.312
Hi, Lily.

03:49.533 --> 03:51.231
Come in.

04:09.379 --> 04:11.990
Where's Katie?

04:12.034 --> 04:13.514
Here.

04:13.557 --> 04:15.516
In the labs.

04:15.559 --> 04:17.257
We'll find her later.

04:19.563 --> 04:21.565
In about half an hour.

04:27.005 --> 04:29.007
I don't know what I am anymore.

04:32.228 --> 04:35.362
Something that
makes no decisions,

04:35.405 --> 04:38.365
has no choices,

04:38.408 --> 04:40.410
follows a path I can't see.

04:42.456 --> 04:45.720
I'm not even choosing the wordsI speak now.

04:46.982 --> 04:48.331
No.

04:51.378 --> 04:54.337
I've watched you speak
these words before.

04:54.381 --> 04:55.817
Many times.

04:56.861 --> 04:59.429
And watched myself reply.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.954
As the words come,

05:02.998 --> 05:06.958
I don't feel as ifI'm consciously repeating lines.

05:08.960 --> 05:12.399
They're just the things that,
at this moment,

05:12.442 --> 05:14.444
I feel I want to say.

05:20.494 --> 05:23.061
You've taken everything from me.

05:24.106 --> 05:26.108
I'm sorry.

05:27.979 --> 05:30.417
I hope I don't
sound unsympathetic,

05:30.460 --> 05:33.463
but I've taken nothing from you.

05:35.422 --> 05:37.424
I can't take what you never had.

05:39.556 --> 05:42.516
The sense that you were
participating in life

05:42.559 --> 05:44.561
was only ever an illusion.

05:46.607 --> 05:49.349
Life is just
something we watch unfold.

05:51.699 --> 05:53.701
Like pictures on a screen.

06:15.723 --> 06:19.683
This is what Devs makes.

06:22.512 --> 06:23.861
Yes.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.823
A film...

06:28.866 --> 06:30.868
of your daughter.

06:32.696 --> 06:35.395
It's not a film, Lily.

06:38.876 --> 06:42.097
Determinism may be strange,

06:42.140 --> 06:44.142
but it's also beautiful.

06:46.754 --> 06:48.712
A small piece of information

06:48.756 --> 06:51.106
provides all information.

06:53.587 --> 06:55.545
The state of every particle

06:55.589 --> 06:58.983
is related to the state
of the particles around it.

07:01.638 --> 07:04.336
Understand the state of one.

07:05.903 --> 07:08.558
Understand the state
of the other.

07:11.518 --> 07:12.867
Keep going.

07:15.913 --> 07:18.568
Know the state of everything.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.446
That's impossible.

07:27.534 --> 07:28.970
No.

07:29.013 --> 07:30.667
It's big data.

07:32.147 --> 07:35.106
The data of all things.

07:35.150 --> 07:36.499
Held.

07:38.545 --> 07:40.329
Owned.

07:44.376 --> 07:45.943
And that's not where it ends.

07:47.597 --> 07:49.599
That's where it starts.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.516
If you have all data,

07:53.560 --> 07:56.563
you have the emergent property
of the data.

07:58.260 --> 08:01.437
The feel of her skin and hair.

08:02.612 --> 08:03.961
Her breath.

08:05.702 --> 08:07.051
The tone of her voice.

08:08.836 --> 08:10.838
Her thoughts and memories.

08:12.927 --> 08:14.929
Her love for me.

08:16.844 --> 08:19.847
Her knowledge
of my love for her.

08:24.765 --> 08:27.289
It's not a film of Amaya.

08:30.771 --> 08:32.773
It is Amaya.

08:34.165 --> 08:36.167
She's alive.

08:43.653 --> 08:45.655
But she's not alive.

08:48.702 --> 08:51.705
She's a computer simulation.

08:52.749 --> 08:54.751
Explain the difference.

08:58.059 --> 09:00.627
She's going through
fixed motions.

09:00.670 --> 09:03.194
As are you.
As am I.

09:03.238 --> 09:05.240
As is everything else.

09:11.855 --> 09:15.816
Jamie said something to me
this morning.

09:23.824 --> 09:25.782
He said...

09:25.826 --> 09:29.830
the problem with the people
that run tech companies

09:29.873 --> 09:32.528
is that they become fanatics.

09:34.878 --> 09:36.576
End up thinking
they're messiahs.

09:42.799 --> 09:46.150
This is the moment
you take the gun out.

09:50.546 --> 09:53.549
The gun that Kenton used
to kill Jamie.

09:55.943 --> 09:57.901
You take it out of your pocket.

09:57.945 --> 09:59.947
Where you were hiding it.

10:08.695 --> 10:09.870
Don't worry.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.915
You aren't about to use it.

10:14.831 --> 10:16.833
Not yet.

10:43.555 --> 10:47.211
You knew I was going
to come here.

10:48.952 --> 10:52.477
And you know what happens here.

10:52.521 --> 10:54.523
Every moment.

10:59.397 --> 11:01.791
But then it all stops working.

11:03.140 --> 11:05.882
I do something

11:05.926 --> 11:07.928
and your system breaks.

11:09.103 --> 11:10.713
Yes.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.759
What do I do?

11:14.543 --> 11:16.545
Don't tell me.

11:20.854 --> 11:22.856
Show me.

11:25.685 --> 11:29.253
Show me exactly
what you've seen.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.039
Yeah.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.525
I'd try to talk you out of it,
but...

11:40.569 --> 11:42.571
I already know I don't.

11:45.269 --> 11:47.271
Sit down.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.798
I think we all know
what we're doing here.

13:21.670 --> 13:23.672
Then open it.

13:26.153 --> 13:28.155
What are you waiting for?

13:29.243 --> 13:30.505
I don't know.

13:30.548 --> 13:32.768
-You're frightened.
-I am frightened. Yes.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.249
However many times
I've seen this,

13:35.292 --> 13:37.729
to be living it now...

13:37.773 --> 13:39.557
Don't worry.

13:39.601 --> 13:41.124
It'll be okay.

13:41.168 --> 13:43.170
I don't know why you say that.

13:46.129 --> 13:48.088
Enough.

13:48.131 --> 13:49.872
This is too much.

13:56.357 --> 13:59.316
So...

13:59.360 --> 14:01.405
this is where you get in.

14:16.943 --> 14:19.641
And this is
where you say goodbye.

14:29.042 --> 14:31.131
Where do you think
we're going, Lily?

14:32.784 --> 14:34.743
To your daughter's statue.

14:34.786 --> 14:36.788
Where you burned Sergei's body.

14:38.225 --> 14:39.922
Where you will...

14:39.966 --> 14:41.576
what?

14:41.619 --> 14:43.143
Exact revenge.

14:46.537 --> 14:48.148
Lily,

14:48.191 --> 14:50.890
you know what happens
to messiahs, don't you?

14:56.112 --> 14:58.245
They get resurrected.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.074
Fuck you.

15:02.118 --> 15:03.250
Do it.

15:05.817 --> 15:06.818
Do it.

15:25.272 --> 15:27.143
Vacuum seal broken.

15:28.231 --> 15:31.626
Vacuum seal broken.

15:33.628 --> 15:35.151
Vacuum seal broken.

17:57.598 --> 17:59.600
I'm gonna die here.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.604
We die here.

18:07.260 --> 18:09.262
I kill us both.

18:12.395 --> 18:13.744
Yes.

18:16.573 --> 18:19.228
And nothing can change it.

18:22.188 --> 18:24.146
Nothing can stop it.

18:25.408 --> 18:27.410
Nothing.

18:30.805 --> 18:33.808
And we can't see
beyond that moment in time.

18:35.288 --> 18:37.290
The predictions fail.

18:38.769 --> 18:40.771
Everything is lost.

18:47.648 --> 18:50.259
Do you know
why you pull the trigger?

18:56.613 --> 18:58.615
It's for Jamie.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.585
So, when do we do this?

19:16.285 --> 19:18.287
How long do we have
left to live?

19:21.421 --> 19:23.423
Only a few minutes, I'm afraid.

19:25.338 --> 19:27.340
That's all.

19:31.431 --> 19:33.433
Sorry.

19:38.394 --> 19:40.396
You do...

19:41.745 --> 19:43.747
...don't you?

19:45.662 --> 19:47.664
You tech leaders...

19:49.492 --> 19:51.494
...think that you're messiahs.

19:54.889 --> 19:56.891
I'll tell you a secret, Lily.

19:59.502 --> 20:01.852
I've been wanting
to tell someone for a while.

20:04.986 --> 20:06.944
The name of the project.

20:06.988 --> 20:08.990
It's not Devs.

20:10.339 --> 20:12.341
The V is Roman.

20:16.389 --> 20:18.391
So, actually, a U.

20:21.785 --> 20:23.787
Deus.

20:30.925 --> 20:32.927
It was just a private joke.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.469
I think our time is up.

20:58.779 --> 21:00.781
Yes.

21:02.391 --> 21:04.393
It is.

22:40.446 --> 22:43.536
I think we all know
what we're doing here.

22:43.579 --> 22:45.581
Then open it.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.889
What are you waiting for?

22:48.932 --> 22:50.847
I don't know.

22:50.891 --> 22:53.546
-You're frightened.
-I am frightened, yes.

22:53.589 --> 22:55.548
However many times
I've seen this,

22:55.591 --> 22:57.376
to be living it now...

22:58.681 --> 23:00.640
Don't worry.

23:00.683 --> 23:02.250
It'll be okay.

23:02.293 --> 23:04.295
I don't know why you say that.

23:06.080 --> 23:08.038
Enough.

23:08.082 --> 23:10.084
It's too much.

23:16.177 --> 23:19.136
So...

23:19.180 --> 23:21.269
this is where you get in.

23:34.325 --> 23:36.676
And this is where
you say goodbye.

24:13.364 --> 24:15.628
That's not possible.

24:15.671 --> 24:17.717
We've left your system.

24:35.038 --> 24:36.997
Forest.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.695
you know the thing
about messiahs, don't you?

24:42.350 --> 24:44.352
They're false prophets.

27:32.346 --> 27:34.348
What did you do?

27:36.959 --> 27:40.876
I disabled the electromagnetic
field system on the capsule.

27:45.751 --> 27:47.100
Why?

27:48.971 --> 27:51.626
Because I realized...

27:53.019 --> 27:54.368
...what we have done.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.677
Someone has to stop this.

28:01.462 --> 28:03.464
Don't blame me, Katie.

28:04.857 --> 28:06.859
It was predetermined.

30:22.777 --> 30:24.779
Forest.

30:26.128 --> 30:27.782
Katie?

30:32.134 --> 30:34.093
Where am I?

30:34.136 --> 30:35.572
Where are you?

30:37.139 --> 30:39.141
I'm in the
visualization chamber.

30:43.058 --> 30:45.060
You're on the screen.

30:50.065 --> 30:52.067
I'm in the system.

30:53.155 --> 30:55.157
What do you remember?

30:56.202 --> 30:58.160
I remember...

30:58.204 --> 31:00.206
everything.

31:02.556 --> 31:04.558
What the fuck did Lily do?

31:06.212 --> 31:09.171
She made a choice.

31:09.215 --> 31:11.217
It's why we could never
see beyond this point.

31:13.306 --> 31:15.264
She made an actual choice.

31:17.310 --> 31:20.313
All her talk
of God and messiahs...

31:21.836 --> 31:24.143
and look
who she turned out to be.

31:24.186 --> 31:26.754
What do you mean?

31:26.797 --> 31:28.799
She committed the original sin.

31:32.325 --> 31:34.327
Disobedience.

31:36.242 --> 31:38.244
She did.

31:42.204 --> 31:43.902
Then it is Deus.

31:46.208 --> 31:48.210
It is Deus.

31:53.433 --> 31:55.435
And that means it's time.

32:00.222 --> 32:02.181
Within itself,

32:02.224 --> 32:05.749
the system is all-knowing
and all powerful.

32:05.793 --> 32:07.795
But only on Lyndon's principle.

32:10.450 --> 32:13.932
I need to know you understand
precisely what that means.

32:15.629 --> 32:17.631
Yes, Katie.

32:19.241 --> 32:20.939
I understand.

32:23.463 --> 32:25.421
Are you sure?

32:25.465 --> 32:27.467
Yes.

32:29.643 --> 32:31.645
I want them back so much.

32:39.392 --> 32:41.394
I know.

32:46.703 --> 32:48.705
All right, fuck it.

32:53.101 --> 32:55.103
I guess wish me luck.

33:05.244 --> 33:07.246
I do.

34:16.402 --> 34:17.881
Hey.

34:17.925 --> 34:19.883
What's up?

34:19.927 --> 34:21.929
Did you have bad dream?

34:26.934 --> 34:28.936
I-I don't know.

34:49.348 --> 34:51.306
Dude.

34:51.350 --> 34:53.613
Move, please.

34:53.656 --> 34:55.267
Yeah.

34:55.310 --> 34:56.659
Sorry.

34:58.444 --> 35:00.402
Oh, uh, hey, Lily.

35:02.448 --> 35:04.406
You guys have a great day.

35:04.450 --> 35:06.234
Be all you can be.

36:28.360 --> 36:29.535
Forest.

36:30.536 --> 36:31.841
Forest.

36:31.885 --> 36:33.191
He just drove past.

36:36.063 --> 36:38.065
-Jesus, Lily!

36:39.893 --> 36:41.634
What's up with you?

36:41.677 --> 36:44.202
You've seen the guywalking around a thousand times.

36:45.768 --> 36:47.770
It was him?

36:48.858 --> 36:50.208
Of course.

37:12.447 --> 37:13.666
So I'll let you know
how it goes, okay?

37:13.709 --> 37:15.494
-Sergei.
-Yeah?

37:15.537 --> 37:18.236
Can I see something
on your phone?

37:21.021 --> 37:22.370
On my phone?

37:25.591 --> 37:27.288
What's this? You want
to check my text messages?

37:28.333 --> 37:30.335
Yes.

37:30.378 --> 37:32.032
Really?

37:34.121 --> 37:36.689
What, you think I've got
a little action on the side?

37:36.732 --> 37:37.907
Please.

37:39.213 --> 37:40.562
Okay.

37:42.434 --> 37:44.697
But there's nothing to see.

37:44.740 --> 37:47.743
I mean, you can't
seriously think that there is.

37:52.531 --> 37:54.141
This is dumb.
Just give me the phone back.

37:54.184 --> 37:55.708
I want to open that app.

37:55.751 --> 37:58.450
It's a fucking sudoku game.
What's the big deal?

37:58.493 --> 38:00.190
I really don't know
what the fuck

38:00.234 --> 38:01.801
you're playing today, Lily.

38:01.844 --> 38:04.282
This is a big day for me,
and you're screwing with it.

38:07.633 --> 38:09.461
Whatever.

38:09.504 --> 38:11.550
I got to go.

38:11.593 --> 38:13.552
I'll see you later, yeah?

38:13.595 --> 38:15.554
Sure.

41:06.638 --> 41:08.640
Hi, Lily.

41:16.909 --> 41:18.911
I don't understand
what's happening.

41:23.219 --> 41:25.221
We died.

41:26.919 --> 41:28.921
Yes.

41:32.228 --> 41:34.230
Then what is this?

41:36.711 --> 41:38.713
You don't know?

41:40.802 --> 41:42.500
We're in the system.

41:43.979 --> 41:45.938
Resurrection.

41:45.981 --> 41:47.983
As promised, remember?

41:56.078 --> 41:58.037
We're in Devs.

41:58.080 --> 42:01.867
-We're in Deus.
-In the simulation.

42:03.695 --> 42:05.653
See it as an afterlife.

42:05.697 --> 42:07.655
Paradise.

42:07.699 --> 42:09.701
In this variation, anyway.

42:11.833 --> 42:13.835
You have your life back, Lily.

42:16.272 --> 42:19.232
Reinserted into existence,

42:19.275 --> 42:22.714
a couple of days
before Sergei was killed.

42:22.757 --> 42:25.325
You can pick up
from where you left off.

42:26.848 --> 42:29.024
If that's what you want.

42:35.640 --> 42:38.599
S... Sergei doesn't know.

42:38.643 --> 42:41.254
That he's in a sim?
No.

42:46.476 --> 42:48.435
Do they know?

42:53.135 --> 42:55.137
No one knows.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.576
Just you and me.

43:02.057 --> 43:04.016
I asked Katie to resurrect us

43:04.059 --> 43:07.019
using data from the moment
of our death.

43:07.062 --> 43:09.891
So our memories,
leading up to that moment,

43:09.935 --> 43:11.632
were kept intact.

43:13.547 --> 43:15.549
That's the cross
we have to bear.

43:17.464 --> 43:19.466
But it's worth it.

43:20.902 --> 43:22.600
You get used to it.

43:26.734 --> 43:28.736
We are now living
in many worlds.

43:30.390 --> 43:33.132
In this world, the two of us
get to live in paradise

43:33.175 --> 43:34.829
with the ones we love.

43:36.962 --> 43:39.660
In other worlds
it will be closer to hell.

43:41.967 --> 43:44.665
For those other, harder lives
we have to lead...

43:46.798 --> 43:48.669
...I thought knowledge
would be a comfort.

43:48.713 --> 43:50.932
I don't know if that's right,

43:50.976 --> 43:52.630
but it was the choice I made.

43:54.980 --> 43:58.505
Just thought I'd exercise
a little free will.

44:02.770 --> 44:04.772
And, in any case...

44:08.428 --> 44:10.473
...there's something special
about you, Lily.

44:10.517 --> 44:12.519
Something truly unique.

44:13.563 --> 44:14.913
Something...

44:14.956 --> 44:16.871
I did not want to change.

44:17.959 --> 44:19.526
Hey, smile.

44:19.569 --> 44:20.875
We lucked out.

44:20.919 --> 44:22.747
This life
is one of the good ones.

44:23.791 --> 44:25.793
What's the matter?

44:30.624 --> 44:32.626
I don't know what to do now.

44:34.106 --> 44:36.108
That's easy.

44:38.371 --> 44:40.373
You do what you always do.

44:42.027 --> 44:44.029
You follow your own path.

44:47.902 --> 44:50.775
That's exactly what is special
about you.

44:56.041 --> 44:58.043
I'm sure I'll see you around.

45:00.785 --> 45:02.787
Let's get coffee some time.

45:35.167 --> 45:38.126
So existing inside
the Deus simulation

45:38.170 --> 45:41.782
feels exactly like
existing in reality?

45:41.826 --> 45:44.045
It would be indistinguishable.

45:44.089 --> 45:47.309
Effectively, the simulation
and reality are identical.

45:50.443 --> 45:52.445
Outside of the people
who directly work here...

45:55.665 --> 45:57.929
...who else knows about this?

46:02.063 --> 46:03.717
No one.

46:16.774 --> 46:18.776
I just need you to help me.

46:20.473 --> 46:22.475
To keep it switched on.

46:28.873 --> 46:30.178
Daddy.

47:11.176 --> 47:12.830
Jamie.

50:30.157 --> 50:32.116
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

50:35.336 --> 50:39.340
We have 15 minutesand you have some cool stuffto show us.

50:41.995 --> 50:44.258
- Oh, yeah.

50:47.131 --> 50:48.741
I want you to join Devs.

50:51.396 --> 50:52.614
What is Devs?

50:55.574 --> 50:57.924
It's the most beautiful thingI've ever seen.

51:05.366 --> 51:06.802
I'm gonna miss you so much,

51:06.846 --> 51:08.935
but we can speak on the computerso you'll see my face.

51:08.978 --> 51:11.024
But we won't be able
to touch you.

51:11.068 --> 51:12.373
Hey, look.
You'll still have me.

51:12.417 --> 51:15.333
-Just you?-Yes. Just-- Your father. Hi.

51:22.383 --> 51:24.429
Do I just knock, or what?
What do you think?

51:26.300 --> 51:28.302
I feel like
they're not ever gonna...

51:30.261 --> 51:32.263
Why are you wearing
your sunglasses inside?

51:32.306 --> 51:34.787
Bro, you know I gotta drip, bro.We're goin' to the studioright now.

51:35.657 --> 51:37.355
Snack Time. I didn't--

51:37.398 --> 51:39.966
Okay. You're welcome.

51:41.402 --> 51:43.317
I feel like that did nothing
for my career.

51:52.413 --> 51:53.545
Oh, damn!

52:03.381 --> 52:05.687
They had come
highly recommended

52:05.818 --> 52:09.343
by a mutual vampire
associate of ours,

52:09.474 --> 52:11.780
but nevertheless,
I found it prudent

52:11.824 --> 52:14.043
-to run the traditional
credit checks...

52:14.087 --> 52:15.654
...and reference protocols.

52:15.697 --> 52:19.353
Suffice it to say,
I am part of the 33%

52:19.484 --> 52:23.183
who find it necessary to utilizemy complementary credit check

52:23.227 --> 52:24.793
every year.
