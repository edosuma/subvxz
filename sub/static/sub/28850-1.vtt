00:18.216 --> 00:20.019
<i>I didn't choose
to be this way,</i>

00:20.753 --> 00:23.722
<i>a loner, always seeking
the story unfold around me,</i>

00:24.457 --> 00:26.158
<i>fixating on the details,</i>

00:26.658 --> 00:29.228
<i>creating a "What happened?,"</i>

00:29.829 --> 00:32.131
<i>a "Who does what?" circumstance.</i>

00:33.164 --> 00:34.801
<i>It is who I am.</i>

00:36.101 --> 00:38.568
<i>Always been and always will be.</i>

00:38.570 --> 00:40.105
<i>A writer.</i>

02:05.790 --> 02:07.359
Take a look.

02:41.492 --> 02:43.263
They're not going to find him.

02:44.430 --> 02:45.731
I'm sure of it.

03:28.941 --> 03:30.409
Morning, honey.

03:31.676 --> 03:32.945
Good morning.

03:36.048 --> 03:37.650
Is this for me?

03:45.056 --> 03:47.593
It should be good.
It's certainly unconventional.

03:48.360 --> 03:50.393
Look, I'm almost there.

03:50.395 --> 03:52.397
I'm just working out
the final details.

03:53.331 --> 03:55.268
Just tell him I'll need a week.

04:39.911 --> 04:40.846
Hey.

04:44.615 --> 04:45.851
Is everything okay?

04:47.985 --> 04:49.055
Yeah.

04:49.922 --> 04:51.591
Everything's status quo.

04:52.824 --> 04:54.524
Well, it sounded
like you were having

04:54.526 --> 04:55.694
a bit of an issue...

04:56.595 --> 04:58.331
during that phone call.

05:04.036 --> 05:05.504
You look beautiful.

05:07.773 --> 05:09.375
You don't look bad yourself.

05:11.043 --> 05:12.444
I love you.

05:17.014 --> 05:18.985
Come on.
Let's get outta here.

05:32.697 --> 05:34.032
What a day.

05:55.954 --> 05:58.925
I hope you don't mind, honey.
I invited her.

06:05.029 --> 06:07.866
Happy fucking anniversary,
Isabelle.

06:38.797 --> 06:39.966
Blake.

06:42.634 --> 06:44.737
I don't think
we've formally met.

06:48.906 --> 06:50.509
You are exquisite.

06:54.146 --> 06:56.682
But we have met before.
At the café.

06:57.115 --> 06:58.884
I served you and your husband.

07:04.156 --> 07:06.858
Are you sure you want me here,
or is this some kind of joke?

07:08.860 --> 07:11.062
Cecile, why don't you join us
for our anniversary?

07:12.964 --> 07:15.734
Yes, Cecile. Please do.

07:38.656 --> 07:40.589
The sun is going to keep
getting hotter.

07:40.591 --> 07:42.762
So, when you put your suit on,
you should cover up.

07:45.029 --> 07:46.798
You know, it's true
what George says about you.

07:49.267 --> 07:52.704
You are the most beautiful girl
I've seen with him.

07:55.307 --> 07:56.943
Thank you.

07:57.942 --> 07:59.776
Ever since I saw you
at the café,

07:59.778 --> 08:02.014
I've been
absolutely mesmerized by you.

08:03.615 --> 08:05.617
It's an illusion, my dear.

08:07.886 --> 08:09.555
He tends to like them
in their prime.

08:10.822 --> 08:12.591
Usually not as sweet
as you, though.

08:14.293 --> 08:16.562
- "They?"
- Well, of course.

08:17.028 --> 08:18.898
You don't think that you were
his only, did you?

08:22.800 --> 08:24.267
George seems
like the kind of man

08:24.269 --> 08:25.872
that can handle
more than one woman.

08:26.737 --> 08:27.870
If that's what suits him,

08:27.872 --> 08:30.575
then who am I to judge
what he does in his spare time?

08:32.076 --> 08:34.547
He'd be perfect.
if not for his needs.

08:37.716 --> 08:39.217
Do you enjoy sleeping with him?

08:42.754 --> 08:44.155
I do prefer older men.

08:51.830 --> 08:53.733
After ten years of marriage,

08:54.765 --> 08:57.168
you tend to get a sense
of what your man likes.

09:00.339 --> 09:02.973
If this trip
goes according to my plan,

09:02.975 --> 09:04.810
maybe I'll like you, too.

09:08.145 --> 09:09.915
I think you already do.

09:13.351 --> 09:15.187
George, is it too soon?

09:16.822 --> 09:18.924
Too soon for what?

09:20.759 --> 09:22.228
My wife likes to drink.

09:25.297 --> 09:27.700
I know that phrase
like the back of my hand.

09:28.100 --> 09:31.001
Well, George,
in honor of our young guest

09:31.003 --> 09:32.738
let's grab the champagne.

09:35.072 --> 09:36.641
Oh, don't worry
about it, darling.

09:38.009 --> 09:39.345
<i>When you're out
here, time doesn't exist.</i>

09:40.177 --> 09:41.844
<i>You can do anything,</i>

09:41.846 --> 09:43.048
<i>be anyone you want.</i>

09:44.383 --> 09:47.119
<i>Because without time,
then it never really happened.</i>

09:51.889 --> 09:53.326
Are you gonna let 'em go?

09:53.892 --> 09:54.860
Nope.

09:56.126 --> 09:58.630
Clear as day, I gotta get more
information from each of 'em.

09:59.264 --> 10:01.233
And certainly not
'til we run some tests.

10:03.067 --> 10:04.870
Right. The shawl.

10:05.403 --> 10:06.871
Not only that. Look at him.

10:08.072 --> 10:10.775
Our young addict just got
his blood drawn this morning.

10:12.009 --> 10:13.879
Oh, but he already
admitted to that.

10:14.346 --> 10:15.780
Just being thorough.

10:18.817 --> 10:20.219
I wonder which one did it?

10:20.785 --> 10:22.187
<i>Which one?</i>

10:28.726 --> 10:30.129
I'm old school.

10:31.830 --> 10:35.799
This is Detective Kenny Park.
K-E-N-N-Y P-A-R-K.

10:35.801 --> 10:39.234
Badge number 817A334,

10:39.236 --> 10:41.271
on November 17th, 2015.

10:41.273 --> 10:43.209
I am interviewing
Isabelle Boulangé.

10:43.942 --> 10:45.745
Why don't you just tell me
what happened?

10:48.913 --> 10:52.183
<i>I'm just
his casual weekend friend.</i>

10:53.250 --> 10:54.917
The kind that usually
has consequences

10:54.919 --> 10:56.018
if you're not discreet.

10:56.020 --> 10:57.887
Weren't you concerned
about being out on the ocean

10:57.889 --> 10:59.125
with a jealous wife?

11:01.326 --> 11:03.229
I've been in worse situations.

11:07.298 --> 11:08.967
<i>Do you think
George and Isabelle...</i>

11:10.836 --> 11:11.901
<i>and maybe even Blake,</i>

11:11.903 --> 11:13.739
<i>have done
this sort of thing before?</i>

11:15.874 --> 11:17.677
<i>Like it's a game to them?</i>

11:20.177 --> 11:22.313
<i>I don't really think
about it, Detective Park.</i>

11:23.014 --> 11:24.383
People come and go.

11:25.484 --> 11:27.219
I'm not invested.

11:32.256 --> 11:33.725
<i>These two...</i>

11:34.860 --> 11:36.095
<i>they seem awfully in synch.</i>

11:37.028 --> 11:38.895
<i>And the mannerisms,</i>

11:38.897 --> 11:42.100
<i>their tone,
the creepishly similar looks.</i>

11:43.467 --> 11:45.768
Come on. Cecile and Isabelle?

11:45.770 --> 11:47.337
Isabelle's honest.

11:47.339 --> 11:49.108
Something trustworthy about her.

11:51.208 --> 11:54.109
<i>And this guy,
he has this gorgeous wife</i>

11:54.111 --> 11:56.411
<i>and what, this...
this sex toy on the side?</i>

11:56.413 --> 11:58.783
Or whatever the fuck
they've been saying?

11:59.518 --> 12:01.316
C'mon, let's call this
for what it is.

12:01.318 --> 12:03.286
Some kinky...

12:03.288 --> 12:05.220
Eyes Wide Shut <i>sort of thing,</i>

12:05.222 --> 12:07.489
<i>and... and a fight
between some jealous bitch,</i>

12:07.491 --> 12:09.825
<i>who may or may not be
a closeted lesbian.</i>

12:09.827 --> 12:12.230
<i>Now she,
or someone, or all of them,</i>

12:13.230 --> 12:15.964
they knock this fucker out. Hmm?

12:15.966 --> 12:17.267
<i>He falls
over the side of the boat</i>

12:17.269 --> 12:18.336
<i>and the rest is history.</i>

12:19.370 --> 12:21.039
<i>Now,
you want my personal opinion?</i>

12:22.072 --> 12:24.009
<i>They're all covering for this
as a trio.</i>

12:26.477 --> 12:28.913
Where did you go, George?

12:30.381 --> 12:32.250
<i>What happened?</i>

12:33.918 --> 12:35.819
<i>Talk to me.</i>

12:35.821 --> 12:37.389
<i>They killed him, Park.</i>

12:38.389 --> 12:41.824
And what we have here
is a story of betrayal,

12:41.826 --> 12:45.965
adultery, mind fucking games,
sex, and money.

12:52.537 --> 12:54.273
<i>Is it really, though?</i>

12:56.341 --> 12:57.909
<i>I mean, on the surface, yeah.</i>

12:58.409 --> 12:59.410
It is.

13:02.379 --> 13:03.849
But there's always more.

13:07.418 --> 13:09.420
<i>Why have Blake and Cecile there?
What's the point?</i>

13:24.501 --> 13:26.938
So, I guess
you're used to being alone.

13:28.405 --> 13:30.141
Are you lonely, Cecile?

13:31.442 --> 13:33.111
<i>I may be young, but...</i>

13:35.113 --> 13:37.983
I've already learnt
that life is lonely, Detective.

13:43.388 --> 13:44.990
Are you happy
now, George?

13:48.927 --> 13:51.497
When are you going
to sleep with her, George?

13:55.466 --> 13:57.001
Relax, Isabelle.

13:57.568 --> 13:59.102
It's not always about you,

13:59.104 --> 14:00.538
and what you think
people ought to do.

14:01.239 --> 14:02.608
I get it.

14:03.674 --> 14:05.977
Stop telling me
to relax, George.

14:06.443 --> 14:07.609
God.

14:07.611 --> 14:10.949
Show me a goddamn emotion,
you know, something. Anything!

14:12.049 --> 14:14.419
Sometimes you are
just so fucking detached.

14:16.354 --> 14:19.988
Honey, I have a book to write,
and you know what that entails.

14:19.990 --> 14:22.528
This wasn't supposed to be
a weekend for your writing.

14:23.193 --> 14:25.063
This is our ten year
anniversary! This is about us!

14:25.931 --> 14:27.466
And apparently Cecile.

14:29.366 --> 14:32.170
Okay, look, I get it. I'm sorry.

14:33.672 --> 14:36.542
Just remember these ideas
pay for our lifestyle.

14:39.076 --> 14:40.479
You just want control.

14:41.513 --> 14:44.149
And for us to be grateful
for the things that you give us.

14:44.649 --> 14:47.285
But everything comes attached
to an expectation.

14:48.552 --> 14:49.819
Honey...

14:49.821 --> 14:51.624
Do you like having
everyone need you? Is that it?

14:53.224 --> 14:55.326
Why don't you
take a seat upstairs,

14:55.994 --> 14:57.026
okay?

14:57.028 --> 14:59.197
I get it. I'll stop.

15:14.211 --> 15:15.380
What's that?

15:16.081 --> 15:17.548
It's a fishermen's buoy.

15:18.416 --> 15:20.451
Helps the fishermen mark
where their nets are.

15:21.352 --> 15:24.555
But, uh, it's also
so that I don't hit them.

15:28.426 --> 15:30.162
Are they always like this?

15:31.196 --> 15:32.598
Not usually.

15:33.298 --> 15:35.067
Think it might be, uh...

15:36.368 --> 15:37.469
Me?

15:38.602 --> 15:40.004
I get it.

15:43.041 --> 15:44.376
So, he's writing a book, then?

15:46.277 --> 15:48.080
He always has a book to write.

15:50.148 --> 15:52.117
I didn't know he was a writer.

15:53.083 --> 15:55.586
Have you read any of his books?
Are they any good?

15:56.520 --> 15:58.356
Well, I'm always in 'em.

15:59.591 --> 16:01.293
In one form or another.

16:04.395 --> 16:06.497
George likes
to put people in situations,

16:07.197 --> 16:09.134
and then see
how things play out.

16:11.702 --> 16:14.206
I guess four people
on the sailboat fits the bill.

16:21.111 --> 16:22.647
Speak of the devil.

16:27.251 --> 16:28.721
It's Hemingway.

16:29.721 --> 16:31.423
I'll read it
as soon as I get to the beach.

16:32.190 --> 16:33.258
Seagulls.

16:46.104 --> 16:47.706
<i>A Seagull in the Water.</i>

16:48.740 --> 16:51.239
Yes, it's going to be
his best one yet,

16:51.241 --> 16:52.377
isn't it, George?

16:53.711 --> 16:56.115
Now, who needs
a drink like I do?

16:57.548 --> 16:59.050
Here, have a glass.

17:12.230 --> 17:13.731
Scavengers.

17:14.632 --> 17:16.435
They take things.

17:18.303 --> 17:20.268
They wait,
and when the moment strikes,

17:20.270 --> 17:22.339
they fight for whatever's
available to them.

17:30.748 --> 17:34.219
If you would've told me
I'd be sipping champagne

17:34.719 --> 17:37.756
on a sailboat
across the Pacific Riviera

17:39.557 --> 17:41.426
with a beautiful woman,

17:41.792 --> 17:43.661
I would've thought
I'd died and gone to heaven.

17:45.529 --> 17:47.331
We have a lot to talk about.

17:52.369 --> 17:55.373
So, George is an author?

17:56.207 --> 17:57.543
When I met him,

17:58.308 --> 18:00.846
I was drawn
to his strength, his...

18:02.247 --> 18:03.649
unpredictability.

18:04.950 --> 18:06.751
<i>He's the kind of man
that can own you with a look.</i>

18:09.319 --> 18:10.621
Control...

18:12.156 --> 18:13.625
manipulation.

18:16.594 --> 18:18.630
And this is
attractive to you, yes?

18:20.565 --> 18:22.334
<i>The man
that plays with each of you</i>

18:23.835 --> 18:26.138
like you're a pawn
in his mental game of chess?

18:28.539 --> 18:29.841
I like games.

18:31.776 --> 18:34.145
I like playing them
and I like being in them.

18:40.919 --> 18:43.222
Do you like role-playing,
Detective?

18:49.294 --> 18:50.528
I'm married, ma'am.

18:52.196 --> 18:53.698
I like to avoid games.

18:58.336 --> 18:59.837
The spirit of choice.

19:00.605 --> 19:03.773
What people do,
and why they do it...

19:03.775 --> 19:07.412
If, in fact, they had to make
a decision in the moment,

19:07.945 --> 19:10.448
if motivated,
would they react...

19:12.616 --> 19:13.551
would they hesitate?

19:17.221 --> 19:18.456
<i>Is this yours?</i>

19:24.528 --> 19:25.730
I was wearing it.

19:26.463 --> 19:27.398
<i>Isabelle asked me to.</i>

19:29.467 --> 19:30.602
<i>To cover you up?</i>

19:33.837 --> 19:35.773
Or to dress me up. Like a doll.

19:38.576 --> 19:40.211
Is this George's blood?

20:13.845 --> 20:16.379
So you're the sober one
on this boat trip?

20:16.381 --> 20:17.716
Nineteen months.

20:20.585 --> 20:21.853
Just curious.

20:22.653 --> 20:24.522
How does one
get heroin on a boat?

20:27.858 --> 20:28.993
By bringing it.

20:32.997 --> 20:34.266
To each his own.

20:40.938 --> 20:42.274
I screwed up.

20:45.843 --> 20:47.479
Have some coffee.

20:53.050 --> 20:54.885
Do you honestly believe...

20:56.688 --> 20:58.590
after coming down from heroin,

21:00.490 --> 21:02.260
that I'd want a cup of coffee?

21:05.863 --> 21:07.766
Blake, what happened out there?

21:12.369 --> 21:13.702
<i>Now, as you get older,</i>

21:13.704 --> 21:15.671
you come to realize that meaning

21:15.673 --> 21:17.675
is what gets you
outta bed in the morning.

21:18.710 --> 21:19.911
To catch a fish.

21:20.678 --> 21:23.048
Not just a fish,
the biggest fish.

21:23.714 --> 21:25.483
And that was
the old man's purpose.

21:28.653 --> 21:30.756
What happens
when you catch that fish?

21:32.723 --> 21:34.292
I don't know.

21:34.692 --> 21:36.295
See, Blake, that's the point.

21:37.561 --> 21:40.595
Life's not black and white.
If it was, we'd have no purpose.

21:40.597 --> 21:42.597
We need uncertainty.

21:42.599 --> 21:46.070
We need something
to... to need, to possess,

21:46.971 --> 21:48.839
to give reason to all this...

21:49.840 --> 21:51.075
this beauty,

21:52.576 --> 21:54.779
this nothingness
that surrounds you and I.

21:56.580 --> 21:58.516
Context. Right.

22:00.718 --> 22:03.654
And once the fisherman gets it,
a shark comes along

22:04.388 --> 22:06.457
and devours the old man's catch,

22:07.023 --> 22:09.491
the universe correcting itself.

22:09.493 --> 22:10.928
The old man's purpose,

22:11.561 --> 22:16.067
spend your whole life learning
to accept the lack of control.

22:20.070 --> 22:21.539
Irony.

22:22.038 --> 22:24.608
The basis
by which all art exists.

22:29.646 --> 22:31.482
Some bullshit that was.

22:32.950 --> 22:34.119
Blake...

22:35.886 --> 22:37.521
I need to understand the day.

22:39.022 --> 22:40.922
Why George has disappeared.

22:40.924 --> 22:41.757
Not his philosophy,

22:41.759 --> 22:43.729
nor his little
parenting anecdotes.

22:46.163 --> 22:50.102
In order to give you
a goddamn understanding,

22:51.568 --> 22:54.038
you have to know the background
of how it all happened.

23:08.952 --> 23:09.820
Sorry.

23:11.189 --> 23:13.759
Please, proceed.

23:14.791 --> 23:18.028
Anything involving George
cannot be easily explained.

23:19.663 --> 23:22.032
He's unpredictable.
Unreasonable.

23:24.469 --> 23:28.440
Yet completely logical
and without any emotion.

23:30.007 --> 23:31.442
Like a genius.

23:34.878 --> 23:36.548
Or a sociopath.

23:41.618 --> 23:44.455
<i>Let me paint you a Rembrandt.</i>

23:45.856 --> 23:50.528
<i>Time spent with George is
like time spent with a master.</i>

23:51.596 --> 23:53.964
<i>On one side,
you feel for the guy.</i>

23:55.266 --> 23:56.699
<i>On the other hand,</i>

23:56.701 --> 24:02.106
<i>is it some brilliantly woven
manipulation of your emotions?</i>

24:07.711 --> 24:09.013
It's a compass?

24:10.047 --> 24:11.182
It is.

24:12.016 --> 24:13.585
It's quite nice.

24:14.885 --> 24:15.753
Is it?

24:17.020 --> 24:17.989
It's broken.

24:18.990 --> 24:20.525
I can see that.

24:24.528 --> 24:27.598
What about George
are you protecting?

24:30.101 --> 24:32.535
Why do you think
I'm protecting George?

24:32.537 --> 24:34.706
Because you just said
he was your master.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.142
You misinterpreted.

24:37.741 --> 24:40.644
He isn't my master. Nobody is.

24:41.612 --> 24:44.646
I needed a place to live,
and George took me in.

24:44.648 --> 24:49.183
He gives me what I need
and I give him what he needs.

24:49.185 --> 24:50.788
Simple as that.

24:52.757 --> 24:54.192
He's my friend.

24:55.593 --> 24:59.096
But I'm not protecting
anybody but myself, Detective.

25:00.298 --> 25:01.532
If he's gone...

25:03.334 --> 25:04.736
do you get his boat?

25:07.738 --> 25:09.604
<i>You think
that I would help Isabelle</i>

25:09.606 --> 25:12.644
<i>off her husband
and then get to keep his boat?</i>

25:13.743 --> 25:15.311
<i>What's my endgame?</i>

25:15.313 --> 25:18.283
<i>If I was stupid enough
to do something like that?</i>

25:19.349 --> 25:22.086
Only someone
who truly hated being controlled

25:23.086 --> 25:24.955
could find
that kind of motivation.

25:26.656 --> 25:27.826
Maybe it was you.

25:30.027 --> 25:31.563
<i>Maybe it was Isabelle.</i>

25:34.265 --> 25:36.101
Maybe it was you and Isabelle.

25:38.301 --> 25:39.867
I'm my own master.

25:39.869 --> 25:41.539
I had nothing to gain.

25:43.007 --> 25:45.677
Each day, I wake up
and I try to survive.

25:46.676 --> 25:48.677
<i>George gave me more than enough,</i>

25:48.679 --> 25:50.315
<i>and I would never take from him.</i>

25:50.914 --> 25:52.884
<i>At least not without his giving.</i>

25:54.018 --> 25:56.821
<i>I know you're an addict.
I know you relapsed.</i>

25:57.221 --> 25:58.957
And I'm sorry.

25:59.390 --> 26:01.757
But I have got
two women in the other room

26:01.759 --> 26:03.662
and a man who's disappeared.

26:06.730 --> 26:08.162
So you have got

26:08.164 --> 26:10.335
to give me something
to work with here.

26:13.037 --> 26:15.173
You want something to work with.

26:17.407 --> 26:20.778
I didn't do the heroin
that's in my system.

26:26.317 --> 26:28.883
<i>I don't know how it got there.</i>

26:28.885 --> 26:32.957
I went to bed sober
and I woke up like this.

26:33.423 --> 26:34.925
It was definitely mine...

26:36.227 --> 26:38.697
but it was around my neck
when I went to bed.

26:41.932 --> 26:43.602
How's that for something?

26:44.934 --> 26:47.105
<i>You know
what I love about this compass?</i>

26:48.338 --> 26:50.307
It's perfect to its design.

26:51.776 --> 26:52.909
There was a problem

26:52.911 --> 26:55.344
and a man came up with an idea
to solve that problem

26:55.346 --> 26:56.615
and this is it.

26:57.682 --> 27:02.086
Now, it can be a, uh,
paperweight or a doorstop,

27:03.386 --> 27:05.019
but that's not
what it's meant to be.

27:05.021 --> 27:06.854
It's not
what it's designed to be.

27:06.856 --> 27:09.226
But what it does best is

27:10.094 --> 27:12.330
show us the way.

27:13.897 --> 27:15.165
That's simple,

27:17.300 --> 27:18.903
but it has value.

27:33.183 --> 27:35.386
What were you boys doing
downstairs for so long?

27:36.487 --> 27:38.856
Organizing the cabin
and packing for the beach.

27:39.423 --> 27:42.391
I showed Blake what you got me
for our second anniversary.

27:42.393 --> 27:43.894
Mm.

27:48.766 --> 27:51.299
I bought this for George
when we went to Morocco.

27:51.301 --> 27:53.267
I sat in a flea market
for three hours

27:53.269 --> 27:54.873
while he
tried to talk the price down.

27:55.239 --> 27:57.506
He practically stole it
from that poor little man.

27:57.508 --> 27:59.941
He was
a third-generation fisherman.

27:59.943 --> 28:01.980
Got it off
his grandfather's boat.

28:03.346 --> 28:06.914
He hated boats, so I was
practically doing him a favor.

28:06.916 --> 28:08.019
Right.

28:13.089 --> 28:14.259
Don't worry.

28:14.959 --> 28:16.428
She likes to do this to me.

28:18.028 --> 28:19.961
She likes to see me beg.

28:19.963 --> 28:22.299
This time I'm really
gonna do it, George.

28:24.801 --> 28:26.737
It's not worth it, Isabelle.

28:31.174 --> 28:33.043
Oh, but it's
so much fun, though.

28:34.345 --> 28:37.546
Hey, guys, Three Arch Bay's
coming right past that cove.

28:37.548 --> 28:38.782
We should anchor soon.

28:49.492 --> 28:51.026
<i>This wasn't
the first time</i>

28:51.028 --> 28:52.430
<i>we'd gone to Three Arch Bay.</i>

28:54.798 --> 28:57.035
<i>We've become very familiar
with the area...</i>

29:00.136 --> 29:02.571
<i>and we knew which times
to enjoy the beach privately</i>

29:02.573 --> 29:04.042
<i>with no other boats.</i>

29:06.876 --> 29:08.746
<i>We took
the smaller boat to shore...</i>

29:10.580 --> 29:12.483
<i>and had a perfect day.</i>

29:24.929 --> 29:28.365
<i>The thing about Three Arch Bay
is it's secluded.</i>

29:31.067 --> 29:32.836
<i>You can climb the rocks,</i>

29:33.903 --> 29:35.306
<i>scale the hill,</i>

29:36.440 --> 29:38.977
<i>traverse the underwater coral.</i>

29:41.144 --> 29:42.844
<i>It's the type of place
you'd expect</i>

29:42.846 --> 29:45.383
<i>a couple like George
and Isabelle to go to.</i>

29:47.984 --> 29:49.520
<i>It's heaven on Earth.</i>

29:52.155 --> 29:54.291
<i>George and I
walked along the beach,</i>

29:55.558 --> 29:58.028
<i>talked about life, art,</i>

29:58.962 --> 30:00.964
<i>and the idea of finding peace,</i>

30:02.199 --> 30:04.803
<i>which was something
that we talked about often.</i>

30:06.569 --> 30:08.970
<i>Cecile and Isabelle
were laying on the beach,</i>

30:08.972 --> 30:13.010
<i>continuing to drink champagne
while bathing under the sun.</i>

30:19.383 --> 30:21.119
<i>Everybody was getting along.</i>

31:53.711 --> 31:57.682
This place,
how can you stand it?

31:58.648 --> 32:00.550
It's just so beautiful.

32:03.252 --> 32:05.088
I'm used
to living out of a suitcase.

32:06.190 --> 32:07.592
Ever since I was a kid,

32:08.491 --> 32:09.661
all alone.

32:12.162 --> 32:14.065
Along the way
I got comfortable...

32:16.032 --> 32:17.100
wandering,

32:18.434 --> 32:19.604
knowing that...

32:21.305 --> 32:22.440
it was just me.

32:23.240 --> 32:24.342
Just me,

32:25.576 --> 32:26.544
alone.

32:34.018 --> 32:35.687
When I was your age,
I left home.

32:37.488 --> 32:39.353
Abusive father,

32:39.355 --> 32:41.358
an emotionally unavailable
mother...

32:42.726 --> 32:46.130
And a wild nature
I just had to explore.

32:46.630 --> 32:48.499
That's how I met George.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.269
At first, he scared me.

32:53.537 --> 32:55.707
He was
the first man I couldn't resist.

32:57.173 --> 32:58.442
I knew I was going to marry him.

33:00.376 --> 33:02.746
I needed something to ground me.

33:03.547 --> 33:05.316
Someone who made me feel safe.

33:06.282 --> 33:08.352
Someone who made me feel
less alone.

33:09.452 --> 33:11.154
But now I've come to learn...

33:12.288 --> 33:14.592
sometimes it's better
not to feel safe.

33:20.263 --> 33:21.431
Leave him.

33:24.667 --> 33:25.635
Look.

33:28.305 --> 33:31.609
Something I took from my mother
before I left home.

33:39.615 --> 33:41.419
This isn't right. You...

33:42.452 --> 33:43.587
you don't know me.

33:44.221 --> 33:46.190
A day before I left home,

33:46.757 --> 33:48.359
I was on a train...

33:49.692 --> 33:51.362
and I looked out the window...

33:53.529 --> 33:57.300
there were sunflower fields
as far as the eye could see.

34:01.270 --> 34:02.572
Come on.

34:03.606 --> 34:05.209
Let's go play in the water.

34:15.385 --> 34:18.322
Aw, I swear
I can do it five times.

34:19.188 --> 34:20.489
Like this.

34:22.826 --> 34:25.096
It doesn't work for me
like that!

34:25.695 --> 34:27.561
- Can you hear that?
- What?

34:27.563 --> 34:28.762
No, seriously.

34:28.764 --> 34:30.599
- You can hear that?
- What is it?

34:30.601 --> 34:32.733
It's a whole orchestra
of violins

34:32.735 --> 34:34.735
playing just for you.
There you go.

34:34.737 --> 34:36.905
- That's real funny, George.
- No, I'm serious! Hey, guys,

34:36.907 --> 34:39.407
guys, come back!
He wants you to play for him.

34:39.409 --> 34:40.775
- Seriously. He does.
- George!

34:40.777 --> 34:41.507
- Come back!
- What?

34:41.510 --> 34:43.411
The joke
is already getting old.

34:43.413 --> 34:45.083
I don't need anybody's sympathy.

34:51.688 --> 34:53.523
The girls look
like they're having a good time.

35:05.835 --> 35:09.537
You ever, uh,
build a sand castle, Blake?

35:09.539 --> 35:10.804
Of course.

35:10.806 --> 35:12.442
I mean a sand castle,

35:13.309 --> 35:16.847
with a moat,
a labyrinth of tunnels, and...

35:19.282 --> 35:21.418
and a maze
to protect your queen.

35:22.286 --> 35:23.855
I'd have to find a queen first.

35:25.521 --> 35:28.391
Those two. They're dangerous.

35:30.927 --> 35:32.395
Why would you say that?

35:33.864 --> 35:36.367
You know,
when I was seven years old,

35:36.967 --> 35:39.537
I saw the most beautiful girl
I'd ever come across.

35:40.871 --> 35:44.338
And so, uh,
naturally, I ran to the store

35:44.340 --> 35:47.409
and I got her
a 12-dollar diamond necklace,

35:47.411 --> 35:49.347
and wrote
the most professing poem,

35:49.880 --> 35:53.416
and even pulled down two flowers
from my mother's garden.

35:54.985 --> 35:56.418
So, when I saw her next,

35:56.420 --> 35:58.623
I gave her
all those things, the gift,

35:59.655 --> 36:01.159
the poem, and the flower.

36:02.626 --> 36:03.694
What happened?

36:04.961 --> 36:06.931
They tore the poem to pieces.

36:08.231 --> 36:09.666
They ripped the necklace apart,

36:10.867 --> 36:13.838
and the flow...
and the flowers, well, they, uh,

36:14.570 --> 36:16.873
they were already dead
by the time I got them to her.

36:20.911 --> 36:22.579
Things don't get better, Blake.

36:23.746 --> 36:24.882
They just get bigger.

36:28.985 --> 36:31.489
I bet I could do it six times.
Hold on!

37:21.471 --> 37:23.940
- Enjoying the day?
- I am.

37:25.442 --> 37:26.543
I love it here.

37:27.943 --> 37:29.447
I can relate.

37:36.786 --> 37:38.489
Do you wanna talk about it?

37:40.923 --> 37:42.492
Do you still love him?

37:44.960 --> 37:47.297
I ask myself that every day.

37:48.664 --> 37:49.666
And?

37:50.768 --> 37:53.403
And I'll let you know
if I come up with an answer.

38:07.083 --> 38:08.752
He really believes in me.

38:10.619 --> 38:12.856
Maybe he has
to believe in something.

38:15.659 --> 38:16.794
One day...

38:18.394 --> 38:20.030
I wanna have a girl like you...

38:23.065 --> 38:24.968
and a boat like that.

38:26.969 --> 38:28.305
My own queen...

38:29.773 --> 38:31.608
to build a sand castle for.

38:43.652 --> 38:45.322
What do you think of Isabelle?

38:47.090 --> 38:48.693
I think she's exquisite.

38:49.425 --> 38:51.328
Do you feel self-conscious?

38:51.862 --> 38:53.497
I just want you to be happy.

38:54.697 --> 38:56.567
I don't know
why you'd choose me instead.

38:58.534 --> 39:00.937
Why do I have to choose?
Why can't I have both of you?

39:02.938 --> 39:04.738
And there's Blake, too.

39:04.740 --> 39:05.775
Well,

39:06.710 --> 39:08.412
everyone likes having a pet.

39:08.978 --> 39:11.146
Come on, George.
You don't always have to be so...

39:11.148 --> 39:13.715
I'm... I'm just
messing with you. Okay?

39:13.717 --> 39:16.420
I'm just playing. I like Blake.
He's a good kid. He's...

39:16.820 --> 39:19.987
You know, I'm teaching him
how to be a man.

39:19.989 --> 39:21.925
What makes a man, a man?

39:23.025 --> 39:24.394
A woman.

39:25.695 --> 39:26.564
Or two.

39:46.182 --> 39:47.585
Hey!

39:54.724 --> 39:56.059
Where's my journal?

39:56.960 --> 39:58.193
I didn't bring it.

39:58.195 --> 39:59.760
Why not?

39:59.762 --> 40:02.095
You asked me
to pack up stuff for a picnic.

40:02.097 --> 40:04.501
I didn't think
it included your journal.

40:06.769 --> 40:08.438
George, let it go.

40:10.673 --> 40:12.143
It's none of your business.

40:13.476 --> 40:14.577
I'll go get it.

40:18.681 --> 40:19.582
Forget it.

40:20.617 --> 40:23.019
I'm done with the beach.
I'm going for a swim.

40:32.695 --> 40:34.632
He's in a rare form today.

40:39.936 --> 40:41.802
<i>George got upset
about his journal,</i>

40:41.804 --> 40:44.942
leaves, swims back to the boat.

40:45.976 --> 40:47.744
<i>What time
would you say that was?</i>

40:49.512 --> 40:50.581
<i>Four o'clock.</i>

40:51.181 --> 40:52.449
You sure?

40:52.916 --> 40:53.984
I'm sure.

40:55.585 --> 40:57.150
Anyone who spends days at sea

40:57.152 --> 40:58.955
can look at the sun
and know the time.

41:01.958 --> 41:04.028
<i>So George
would often leave mid-afternoon?</i>

41:04.960 --> 41:06.894
<i>This wasn't
our first trip.</i>

41:06.896 --> 41:08.965
<i>One gets
quite familiar with patterns.</i>

41:10.634 --> 41:11.902
<i>What happened next?</i>

41:13.168 --> 41:15.672
<i>Cecile and I
went for a hike to sober up.</i>

41:17.039 --> 41:18.840
<i>Mm-hmm. And Blake?</i>

41:18.842 --> 41:20.110
<i>He stayed at the beach</i>

41:20.809 --> 41:22.246
<i>to read the book
George gave him.</i>

41:24.748 --> 41:26.613
<i>With George
leaving so often,</i>

41:26.615 --> 41:28.184
<i>were you ever
concerned about him</i>

41:29.619 --> 41:31.255
just one day disappearing?

41:35.057 --> 41:36.559
If we do find him...

41:38.929 --> 41:40.664
would you be disappointed
if he were dead?

41:46.202 --> 41:47.771
Do you still love your husband?

41:48.271 --> 41:49.606
Isabelle?

42:14.864 --> 42:16.699
<i>Let me tell you
a story, Detective.</i>

42:21.237 --> 42:23.139
<i>Every morning a man wakes up</i>

42:23.907 --> 42:26.577
<i>and he makes
a bowl of oatmeal for his wife.</i>

42:28.110 --> 42:30.880
<i>He cuts up a banana
and puts it on top</i>

42:31.847 --> 42:34.552
<i>and he puts it
on her bedside table.</i>

42:36.219 --> 42:37.755
<i>She wakes up.</i>

42:38.722 --> 42:41.025
<i>She finds the gesture
kind and loving.</i>

42:41.958 --> 42:43.760
But after a month,

42:44.193 --> 42:45.896
she starts to hate it.

42:46.630 --> 42:47.965
She feels obligated.

42:48.797 --> 42:51.968
The thing is, she hates bananas.

42:52.902 --> 42:55.873
<i>So, one evening,
she tells her husband,</i>

42:57.206 --> 42:59.007
<i>"When you make
my breakfast in the morning,</i>

42:59.009 --> 43:00.878
<i>could you add strawberries?"</i>

43:01.844 --> 43:04.180
<i>And he smiles and goes to bed.</i>

43:04.847 --> 43:08.018
She wakes up,
looks at her bedside table

43:08.952 --> 43:11.221
<i>and there's a bowl
of freshly made oatmeal.</i>

43:14.023 --> 43:16.092
And what do you think is on top?

43:18.360 --> 43:19.762
<i>Bananas.</i>

43:21.364 --> 43:24.065
So, you asked me
if I love my husband,

43:24.067 --> 43:27.034
and the answer is yes and no,

43:27.036 --> 43:29.202
because he thinks
he gives me what I need,

43:29.204 --> 43:31.674
but I asked
for fucking strawberries!

43:36.413 --> 43:38.115
<i>Now, women are complicated.</i>

43:39.682 --> 43:41.217
We like being loved.

43:41.951 --> 43:43.820
We need to be touched.

43:45.288 --> 43:47.858
But sometimes,
we need something more.

43:49.324 --> 43:51.060
We need to be heard,

43:52.695 --> 43:54.163
and we need to laugh.

43:58.333 --> 44:00.136
<i>George is a beautiful man,</i>

44:01.737 --> 44:04.407
<i>and he has great intentions,
for the most part.</i>

44:06.909 --> 44:08.177
<i>He's very broken.</i>

44:12.181 --> 44:13.783
Of course I would be devastated.

44:45.215 --> 44:46.684
You okay?

44:50.286 --> 44:51.922
She wants full custody.

44:54.289 --> 44:55.858
Well, that seems pretty harsh.

44:57.293 --> 44:58.929
Nah, I work too much.

45:01.463 --> 45:02.900
And the alcohol?

45:04.501 --> 45:06.403
Nah, I haven't had
a drop in four weeks.

45:10.405 --> 45:11.775
That's a good start.

45:14.210 --> 45:16.012
What do you think
about that kid?

45:16.512 --> 45:18.345
- What, the addict?
- Mm-hmm.

45:18.347 --> 45:19.449
I think he's broken.

45:23.018 --> 45:24.120
He's broken, agree,

45:25.387 --> 45:27.023
<i>but does that make
a young man guilty of murder?</i>

45:28.824 --> 45:30.159
<i>Maybe he snapped.</i>

45:31.960 --> 45:33.763
Question is, why?

45:35.431 --> 45:37.266
What about the English girl?

45:38.034 --> 45:39.066
<i>You know, something about her,</i>

45:39.068 --> 45:41.235
<i>in her eyes,
something mysterious.</i>

45:41.237 --> 45:43.436
You know, like she almost seemed
like she was too innocent.

45:43.438 --> 45:45.842
She's a young girl
trying to find her way.

45:46.275 --> 45:48.277
Wrong place, wrong time,
wrong company.

45:49.445 --> 45:51.381
On the flip side,
what about George?

45:52.081 --> 45:55.950
I mean what if he's
the one in charge, in control?

45:55.952 --> 45:58.021
It was his boat,
and he separated himself.

45:59.856 --> 46:01.759
Four people alone.

46:03.893 --> 46:05.394
<i>The jealous wife,</i>

46:07.297 --> 46:10.934
<i>a young man who presumably wants
what his mentor has,</i>

46:11.568 --> 46:14.138
<i>a young English courtesan
and George.</i>

46:19.074 --> 46:20.210
I love it.

46:21.143 --> 46:22.846
I love these people.

46:23.478 --> 46:25.148
Sir?

46:26.014 --> 46:28.081
There' a man here.
He's a fisherman.

46:28.083 --> 46:29.483
He needs to speak with you.

46:29.485 --> 46:30.617
They found
something in the ocean

46:30.619 --> 46:31.855
they think you should see.

46:57.079 --> 46:58.382
<i>Anyone hungry?</i>

46:59.215 --> 47:01.351
Yeah. I'll get everything ready.

47:06.322 --> 47:07.423
I'll help.

47:10.025 --> 47:12.929
You guys run along.
I'll help George set the table.

47:14.463 --> 47:17.201
You need some water.
You're drunk.

47:18.601 --> 47:20.070
Fuck you, George.

47:57.440 --> 47:58.575
Mm.

48:02.711 --> 48:04.614
This quinoa salad
is amazing, Blake.

48:06.014 --> 48:07.648
Yeah.
You've come a long way

48:07.650 --> 48:09.650
from burning those steaks,
that's for sure.

48:09.652 --> 48:11.320
That was one time.

48:16.659 --> 48:19.226
So, how often do you go sailing?

48:19.228 --> 48:21.498
Oh, well...

48:23.599 --> 48:24.902
what is it honey?

48:25.434 --> 48:27.267
Whenever you have
to get some writing done

48:27.269 --> 48:29.306
we spend the weekend
at sea? Hmm?

48:31.340 --> 48:33.106
Don't let her fool you.

48:33.108 --> 48:35.011
We got the boat
so we could get away.

48:36.079 --> 48:38.981
I promised Isabelle I'd buy her
a home in the middle of nowhere,

48:39.681 --> 48:41.550
but, for now,
this will have to do.

48:42.385 --> 48:45.322
So this just happens to be one of
the weekends when you're working?

48:48.291 --> 48:51.124
Honey, it's not the time,
nor the place, okay?

48:51.126 --> 48:52.525
Oh, when is it ever
the time or the place

48:52.527 --> 48:55.131
to call you out on your
megalomania bullshit, George!

48:55.530 --> 48:56.764
Enough, Isabelle.

48:56.766 --> 48:58.001
Fuck you!

48:58.701 --> 49:00.266
I hate this boat!

49:00.268 --> 49:02.135
And I'm sick of all
your unfulfilled promises!

49:02.137 --> 49:03.472
I said that's enough!

49:06.041 --> 49:07.244
Yes, master.

49:08.043 --> 49:09.177
May I remind you,

49:09.179 --> 49:11.949
I didn't force that fucking ring
on your finger, okay?

49:13.081 --> 49:14.115
You gladly accepted it

49:14.117 --> 49:16.420
because you had
no other choices.

49:17.387 --> 49:20.320
You know, in fact,
none of you would have shit

49:20.322 --> 49:21.525
without me!

49:22.791 --> 49:26.327
So if ever any of you express
anything other than gratitude,

49:26.329 --> 49:28.162
I'll fucking
throw you overboard!

49:28.164 --> 49:29.299
Do you understand me?

49:30.065 --> 49:31.398
All of you want freedom,

49:31.400 --> 49:34.135
yet here you are, resenting me,

49:34.137 --> 49:36.273
as if I'm taking it from you!

49:38.173 --> 49:41.545
Is this not freedom enough, huh?

49:42.677 --> 49:43.980
Huh?

49:49.619 --> 49:51.321
Sorry. Excuse me.

50:43.706 --> 50:45.474
You're the fisherman?

50:49.244 --> 50:50.646
I'm a captain.

50:51.380 --> 50:52.282
Captain.

50:53.349 --> 50:55.452
I'm Detective Park.
Uh, what do you have for me?

50:55.885 --> 50:58.184
Lost and Found wanted this,

50:58.186 --> 51:00.489
but I insisted
a detective look at it.

51:13.369 --> 51:15.204
Have a seat, Captain.

51:26.382 --> 51:27.784
So,
what brings you here?

51:28.451 --> 51:29.586
On the boat?

51:30.887 --> 51:32.222
No, silly.

51:33.489 --> 51:34.356
America.

51:35.324 --> 51:37.860
California. Laguna Beach.

51:39.195 --> 51:40.564
George and Isabelle, and...

51:42.297 --> 51:43.699
yes, the boat.

51:45.668 --> 51:47.771
What brings you here, Blake?

51:49.704 --> 51:51.740
I'm just
trying to find my way...

51:54.710 --> 51:57.447
pick up a thing or two
from the Boulangés.

51:58.547 --> 52:00.583
They have
the type of life that I...

52:01.384 --> 52:02.885
that I see in magazines.

52:03.920 --> 52:05.322
Do they?

52:08.958 --> 52:10.660
At least on the surface.

52:12.827 --> 52:14.597
That's why I like you.

52:16.231 --> 52:18.335
Underneath
all the layers of crap...

52:21.704 --> 52:22.839
you're pure.

52:24.907 --> 52:27.744
That's gotta be the nicest
insult I've ever gotten.

52:31.947 --> 52:33.916
You never answered my question.

52:41.590 --> 52:43.326
I love the black sky.

52:44.960 --> 52:46.395
The white little dots.

52:46.862 --> 52:47.864
It's massive.

52:49.297 --> 52:50.766
We're so insignificant.

52:51.701 --> 52:53.903
We have no idea
what's really out there.

52:58.474 --> 52:59.376
It's heroin.

53:05.614 --> 53:07.283
You wear heroin?

53:10.452 --> 53:11.487
Is...?

53:12.788 --> 53:14.324
You know,
it's like the guy

53:15.523 --> 53:17.893
who keeps a gun
in his safety deposit box.

53:20.028 --> 53:21.597
That's his way out.

53:25.034 --> 53:26.736
This is my way out.

53:30.005 --> 53:31.807
I don't expect to relapse...

53:34.409 --> 53:36.612
and I don't expect
to stay sober.

53:42.385 --> 53:44.821
I saw you watching
Isabelle and I on the beach.

53:50.592 --> 53:51.694
It's okay.

53:52.762 --> 53:54.231
I don't mind.

54:07.876 --> 54:11.045
<i>I... I got a routine.
I check my pots in order.</i>

54:11.047 --> 54:13.880
<i>The day before yesterday
was Tuesday.</i>

54:13.882 --> 54:15.182
<i>I was checking my first pot</i>

54:15.184 --> 54:19.755
<i>and I saw on my third buoy
that there was a boat anchored.</i>

54:20.322 --> 54:21.289
<i>And so I figure</i>

54:21.291 --> 54:23.023
I'll just go check that pot
on the way back.

54:23.025 --> 54:26.994
And when I came back,
the boat was still there.

54:26.996 --> 54:32.035
So, I figured I'll just check
that pot next time I'm out.

54:33.501 --> 54:36.503
Sometimes it's best
to just let a pot soak.

54:36.505 --> 54:38.608
So, you found this, then, today?

54:39.375 --> 54:40.409
Yeah.

54:41.543 --> 54:43.279
Its protocol

54:43.778 --> 54:46.516
<i>to regard the buoys
that we have at sea.</i>

54:46.981 --> 54:49.048
<i>That boat either didn't know
what it was doing,</i>

54:49.050 --> 54:51.820
or it had no regard
for my business dealings.

54:54.123 --> 54:55.625
I found that book

54:56.625 --> 54:59.596
<i>this morning in my lobster pot.</i>

55:00.463 --> 55:01.898
<i>In my lobster pot.</i>

55:06.668 --> 55:08.371
Well,
I appreciate you bringing it in.

55:09.038 --> 55:11.070
Oh, I brought it in, Detective,

55:11.072 --> 55:13.574
because it's
so perfectly preserved

55:13.576 --> 55:15.311
in a watertight bag.

55:16.378 --> 55:18.347
It... it wanted to be found.

55:21.150 --> 55:22.918
I've seen this before.

55:24.018 --> 55:26.722
This is one of the story plots
from his last book.

55:28.490 --> 55:29.659
I'm sure you could find

55:30.626 --> 55:33.028
three more of those if you ask
around the docks, Detective.

55:34.896 --> 55:36.365
If one is found,

55:36.965 --> 55:39.435
you can bet
it was George and his big plan.

55:42.704 --> 55:44.740
It has his signature
all over it.

55:47.876 --> 55:50.911
Did you help your husband
with his writing, Mrs. Boulangé?

55:50.913 --> 55:53.750
Every once in a while,
George would get stuck.

55:55.550 --> 55:56.853
Get writer's block,

55:57.719 --> 55:59.388
gets too close to it.

56:00.456 --> 56:02.925
He told me once
it was like walking through fog.

56:03.826 --> 56:05.128
Whichever direction you go,

56:05.894 --> 56:09.766
however fast you try,
it's just white.

56:10.965 --> 56:13.536
He would get to his last page

56:14.570 --> 56:16.472
and just start from scratch.

56:17.572 --> 56:18.942
Throw his book out.

56:20.208 --> 56:21.877
And I hated that about him.

56:23.012 --> 56:25.115
Do you have any idea
what that can do to a man?

56:27.949 --> 56:29.115
Actually,
I'm more curious

56:29.117 --> 56:31.086
about what that
might do to his wife.

56:33.922 --> 56:36.058
Do you think
I killed my husband?

56:44.132 --> 56:46.001
I think something's happened
to your husband

56:46.835 --> 56:49.104
and I'm trying to figure out
what that something is.

56:50.105 --> 56:51.771
So, how can you
sit here all day long

56:51.773 --> 56:54.076
and just stare daggers at me?

56:54.909 --> 56:56.445
I'm trying to help you,

56:57.646 --> 57:00.680
and you're telling me,
after he disappeared

57:00.682 --> 57:03.483
that this is all
some part of a master plan

57:03.485 --> 57:04.820
by George Boulangé.

57:06.121 --> 57:09.188
<i>What I am saying is
that if there was a fisherman,</i>

57:09.190 --> 57:11.191
and I mean "if,"

57:11.193 --> 57:14.561
then George would know
that it was on this man's route.

57:14.563 --> 57:17.264
He would study
the patterns, the protocols,

57:17.266 --> 57:19.969
and he wouldn't ever allow
our boat to be anchored there.

57:20.835 --> 57:22.704
George doesn't do anything,

57:23.204 --> 57:25.974
and I mean anything,
without forethought.

57:28.677 --> 57:30.644
<i>George
came back from his swim.</i>

57:30.646 --> 57:33.950
<i>He seemed very determined,
almost manic.</i>

57:35.050 --> 57:38.552
<i>For the first time
in having spent time with him,</i>

57:38.554 --> 57:40.657
<i>I was actually concerned.</i>

57:42.257 --> 57:44.793
<i>He was always so calm.</i>

57:46.061 --> 57:47.896
<i>But there was a change in him.</i>

58:02.677 --> 58:04.213
<i>George came back</i>

58:05.780 --> 58:07.083
like he had a plan.

58:08.851 --> 58:10.019
A mission.

58:11.653 --> 58:16.559
<i>There was something
very, very off about him.</i>

58:17.092 --> 58:18.994
<i>I thought
he might hurt Isabelle.</i>

58:19.862 --> 58:21.931
<i>Perhaps
he'd had enough of her drinking.</i>

58:24.599 --> 58:27.603
Or maybe he was gonna hurt
Cecile and me.

58:28.836 --> 58:30.670
<i>He'd had a rough childhood.</i>

58:30.672 --> 58:32.007
<i>From what I gathered,</i>

58:33.041 --> 58:34.777
<i>he had it in him.</i>

58:37.012 --> 58:38.744
"Feed on the dead or injured,

58:38.746 --> 58:40.516
they have a job to do.

58:41.317 --> 58:43.585
They purge the Earth of garbage.

58:45.186 --> 58:47.086
If you look at the abyss
long enough,

58:47.088 --> 58:49.057
the abyss looks back at you.

58:50.925 --> 58:52.027
Nietzsche.

58:54.063 --> 58:56.298
<i>If you look
at the abyss long enough,</i>

58:57.032 --> 59:01.204
the abyss looks back at you."

59:02.972 --> 59:05.174
<i>Every once in a
while, George would get stuck,</i>

59:06.275 --> 59:08.641
<i>and he would get
to his last page</i>

59:08.643 --> 59:11.313
<i>and start from scratch.</i>

59:11.947 --> 59:13.682
<i>I hated that about him.</i>

59:15.217 --> 59:17.653
<i>Anything involving George
cannot be easily explained.</i>

59:19.021 --> 59:22.759
<i>He's unpredictable,
yet completely logical.</i>

59:23.891 --> 59:25.127
<i>Control,</i>

59:25.728 --> 59:27.063
<i>manipulation.</i>

59:28.297 --> 59:29.599
<i>To be honest,</i>

59:31.233 --> 59:32.735
<i>I like games.</i>

59:35.771 --> 59:37.240
<i>Without any emotion.</i>

59:37.940 --> 59:40.076
Everyone likes having a pet.

59:40.675 --> 59:42.108
Seagulls scavenge.

59:42.110 --> 59:46.079
<i>Like a genius or a sociopath.</i>

59:46.081 --> 59:48.017
Seagulls scavenge.

59:48.684 --> 59:50.383
<i>There was a big bang</i>

59:50.385 --> 59:52.889
<i>downstairs in the cabin,
like someone fell.</i>

59:54.188 --> 59:56.692
It got really
uncomfortable really quickly.

59:57.326 --> 01:00:00.228
<i>There we were, on a boat
in the middle of the water.</i>

01:00:00.996 --> 01:00:02.862
<i>What was he gonna do?</i>

01:00:02.864 --> 01:00:06.868
"Most people live a lie,
I strive for truth."

01:00:14.443 --> 01:00:16.245
People live a lie.

01:00:17.846 --> 01:00:19.248
I am truth.

01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:22.619
What did they do to you?

01:00:25.119 --> 01:00:27.757
Lab results
for the blood on the shawl.

01:00:29.023 --> 01:00:30.226
Matches Blake's.

01:00:30.826 --> 01:00:31.657
Not George's.

01:00:31.659 --> 01:00:33.260
Nothing on the boat
matches George.

01:00:33.262 --> 01:00:34.195
It's clean as a whistle.

01:00:34.197 --> 01:00:37.066
Okay. What about
the, uh, spot on the boat?

01:00:39.168 --> 01:00:40.169
Blake.

01:00:50.244 --> 01:00:52.114
What the hell
happened to you, George?

01:01:04.793 --> 01:01:06.295
How did your blood
get on the shawl?

01:01:08.731 --> 01:01:10.433
I guess
Isabelle was really drunk.

01:01:11.766 --> 01:01:14.034
<i>After George
got back from his swim,</i>

01:01:14.036 --> 01:01:15.405
<i>he went down into the cabin.</i>

01:01:17.072 --> 01:01:18.441
Cecile and I stayed on the deck.

01:01:19.208 --> 01:01:21.007
<i>We heard some commotion.</i>

01:01:21.009 --> 01:01:22.344
<i>George raised his voice,</i>

01:01:23.277 --> 01:01:24.913
and there was a loud bang.

01:01:25.847 --> 01:01:27.315
<i>I got up to go check it out.</i>

01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:31.086
But by the time that I got
to the front end of the cabin,

01:01:32.788 --> 01:01:34.356
<i>I got hit square in the head.</i>

01:01:35.824 --> 01:01:37.126
<i>And I must've passed out,</i>

01:01:38.793 --> 01:01:40.459
<i>because the next thing I know</i>

01:01:40.461 --> 01:01:41.931
<i>I'm waking up bloody</i>

01:01:42.965 --> 01:01:44.865
<i>with that shawl around my head</i>

01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:46.202
<i>and Cecile over me.</i>

01:01:46.869 --> 01:01:48.304
<i>That's the last thing
I remember.</i>

01:01:50.139 --> 01:01:51.271
<i>I tried to intervene,</i>

01:01:51.273 --> 01:01:53.273
<i>but George told me
to mind my own business.</i>

01:01:53.275 --> 01:01:56.041
Blake was lying
on the floor, bleeding,

01:01:56.043 --> 01:02:00.048
and Isabelle was drunk
and she was visibly scared.

01:02:01.817 --> 01:02:03.219
<i>George
came back from his swim,</i>

01:02:03.851 --> 01:02:07.422
found a bottle
and accused me of being drunk./

01:02:08.556 --> 01:02:10.523
<i>And he told me
I should go to bed.</i>

01:02:10.525 --> 01:02:12.861
<i>I hate it when he babies me.</i>

01:02:13.461 --> 01:02:16.530
I stumbled, I hit my head,

01:02:16.532 --> 01:02:18.831
<i>and he started to scream.</i>

01:02:18.833 --> 01:02:22.936
At that point I, uh,
I reached for something,

01:02:22.938 --> 01:02:26.442
<i>the, um, compass, maybe.</i>

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:30.847
<i>And that's the last thing
that I remember.</i>

01:02:34.583 --> 01:02:36.516
George got back to the boat,

01:02:36.518 --> 01:02:38.418
<i>noticed Cecile
and Blake together</i>

01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:41.253
<i>at the front of the boat,
realized he was losing control.</i>

01:02:41.255 --> 01:02:43.255
Found a drunk Isabelle,

01:02:43.257 --> 01:02:46.228
<i>tried to put Isabelle to bed,
she resisted,</i>

01:02:47.862 --> 01:02:50.766
someone threw a compass, or not,

01:02:51.233 --> 01:02:53.402
and Blake got his
one way or another.

01:02:55.871 --> 01:02:57.472
So, the shawl
and the journal are useless.

01:02:58.407 --> 01:02:59.740
<i>The compass is just ridiculous.</i>

01:02:59.742 --> 01:03:02.541
<i>And all we've got are
three alibis that all add up.</i>

01:03:06.114 --> 01:03:07.550
Yeah, this is Bailey.

01:03:18.059 --> 01:03:19.427
Accounts have all been drained.

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:21.927
When?

01:03:21.929 --> 01:03:23.563
Midnight, all of the money

01:03:23.565 --> 01:03:26.266
was transferred
into Mrs. Boulangé's accounts.

01:03:26.268 --> 01:03:28.436
Offshore, untraceable.

01:03:37.278 --> 01:03:39.512
<i>Okay, we need to get creative,</i>

01:03:39.514 --> 01:03:41.414
<i>start thinking
like a writer would.</i>

01:03:41.416 --> 01:03:44.117
What grounds us?
What is our foundation?

01:03:44.119 --> 01:03:46.086
George is
obviously the foundation.

01:03:46.088 --> 01:03:48.054
Okay, let's start once again.

01:03:48.056 --> 01:03:51.057
Uh, they wake up, uh,
George says good morning.

01:03:51.059 --> 01:03:53.260
<i>He gives her some flowers,
yada-yada-yada.</i>

01:03:53.262 --> 01:03:54.661
What else? What did George do?

01:03:54.663 --> 01:03:56.362
He makes a call.

01:03:56.364 --> 01:03:58.264
- I'm almost there.
- <i>Get his call logs,</i>

01:03:58.266 --> 01:03:59.432
<i>check
his credit card statements.</i>

01:03:59.434 --> 01:04:01.437
Was she a cosigner
on his accounts?

01:04:02.103 --> 01:04:03.037
<i>Yeah, tell him I need a week.</i>

01:04:03.039 --> 01:04:05.842
I just need to work out
the final details.

01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:09.311
Should be good,
certainly unconventional.

01:04:09.677 --> 01:04:11.443
<i>George doesn't do anything,</i>

01:04:11.445 --> 01:04:15.083
<i>and I mean anything,
without forethought.</i>

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:20.119
We would find the money wired.

01:04:20.121 --> 01:04:22.090
Isabelle
wouldn't be that obvious.

01:04:25.059 --> 01:04:27.059
<i>It's so perfectly preserved</i>

01:04:27.061 --> 01:04:28.897
<i>in a watertight bag.</i>

01:04:29.563 --> 01:04:30.498
The fisherman.

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:33.402
<i>When was the wire made exactly?</i>

01:04:34.202 --> 01:04:36.973
Was it timed? Who sent it?

01:04:37.972 --> 01:04:39.371
<i>Why go on a trip
with your wife</i>

01:04:39.373 --> 01:04:40.542
<i>if you're planning
on taking off?</i>

01:04:41.777 --> 01:04:42.945
<i>Maybe he hadn't made
his decision yet.</i>

01:04:43.478 --> 01:04:44.978
<i>Really?</i>

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:46.248
<i>Can't rule it out, Bailey.</i>

01:04:48.016 --> 01:04:49.218
<i>Then, what are you thinking?</i>

01:04:50.284 --> 01:04:51.553
<i>Maybe this is much broader.</i>

01:04:52.788 --> 01:04:55.421
Okay, get to the boat,
Cecile, cast off and then?

01:04:55.423 --> 01:04:57.057
<i>Then it's
a beautiful day to sail,</i>

01:04:57.059 --> 01:04:58.992
<i>except there's a fight
below deck</i>

01:04:58.994 --> 01:05:00.159
<i>between George and Isabelle.</i>

01:05:00.161 --> 01:05:01.061
It's not always about you,

01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:02.528
and what you think
people ought to do.

01:05:02.530 --> 01:05:03.630
Relax, Isabelle.

01:05:03.632 --> 01:05:04.664
<i>What were they
really fighting about?</i>

01:05:04.666 --> 01:05:07.200
Was she mad at him
because he wanted to leave?

01:05:07.202 --> 01:05:09.202
Was this whole thing
a staged performance?

01:05:09.204 --> 01:05:12.072
I mean, but was their marriage
really on the rocks anyway?

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:13.206
<i>I mean, what if she kills him?</i>

01:05:13.208 --> 01:05:15.041
<i>Throws him over
because she's sick of it.</i>

01:05:15.043 --> 01:05:16.409
<i>The pressure,
the writer's block,</i>

01:05:16.411 --> 01:05:17.947
the bullshit,
the unfulfilled promises.

01:05:19.114 --> 01:05:21.014
Not sure I buy it. Next?

01:05:21.016 --> 01:05:22.315
The, uh, the compass toss.

01:05:22.317 --> 01:05:23.749
It's Blake.

01:05:23.751 --> 01:05:26.987
Blake would do anything
for George. Or Isabelle.

01:05:26.989 --> 01:05:28.255
And Cecile.

01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:31.590
<i>She was brought into this whole
thing to be the one final piece.</i>

01:05:31.592 --> 01:05:33.459
Is she their alibi?

01:05:33.461 --> 01:05:35.561
<i>Then, there's the beach.</i>

01:05:35.563 --> 01:05:37.329
All was fine,
then George decides to write?

01:05:37.331 --> 01:05:40.432
<i>He found inspiration,
or was all part of his plan?</i>

01:05:40.434 --> 01:05:42.202
So, he contacts
the fisherman

01:05:42.204 --> 01:05:43.339
to hand off the journal.

01:05:44.505 --> 01:05:45.371
<i>He knows that,
that way, if he disappears,</i>

01:05:45.373 --> 01:05:47.509
he's got the journal
as a good clue.

01:05:48.543 --> 01:05:50.146
If Isabelle's telling the truth,

01:05:50.778 --> 01:05:53.014
then he did do this on his own.

01:05:54.416 --> 01:05:56.715
Blake said he never does
anything without a plan, right?

01:05:56.717 --> 01:05:58.351
<i>He staged everything.</i>

01:05:58.353 --> 01:06:00.420
He is, or was,
a writer after all.

01:06:00.422 --> 01:06:02.190
But I don't buy it.

01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:04.393
<i>They killed him,
they throw him overboard.</i>

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:07.193
Then everything we've heard,
all of these stories,

01:06:07.195 --> 01:06:09.461
they're just that,
just a string of stories.

01:06:09.463 --> 01:06:11.498
Well conceived, mind you,

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:15.204
but conceived nevertheless
by our three witnesses.

01:06:15.637 --> 01:06:17.440
Fuck!

01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:21.374
Our case file should be called,
"The Disappearance of George

01:06:21.376 --> 01:06:23.446
at the hands of Cecile,
Blake and Isabelle."

01:06:25.047 --> 01:06:27.650
So if, and I mean if,
they did do it,

01:06:28.449 --> 01:06:30.685
<i>then we have to consider
that they're all lying to us.</i>

01:06:33.454 --> 01:06:34.523
<i>Okay?</i>

01:06:35.456 --> 01:06:37.058
Let's have one more chat
with them.

01:06:48.737 --> 01:06:50.239
That's a beautiful necklace.

01:06:51.806 --> 01:06:53.108
Thanks.

01:06:53.474 --> 01:06:55.110
It's been
in my family a long time.

01:06:56.077 --> 01:06:57.313
<i>My mother gave it to me
before she left.</i>

01:06:58.579 --> 01:07:01.416
<i>She said it reminded her
of being wild and free.</i>

01:07:03.251 --> 01:07:04.851
<i>Take me through
the last part of the night</i>

01:07:04.853 --> 01:07:05.721
<i>one more time...</i>

01:07:07.389 --> 01:07:08.324
<i>and the last thing you saw.</i>

01:07:09.590 --> 01:07:12.458
<i>Blake had a pretty nasty cut.</i>

01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:14.696
<i>I went back to check on Isabelle</i>

01:07:15.429 --> 01:07:17.165
<i>and she asked me
to lay in bed with her.</i>

01:07:18.132 --> 01:07:21.736
<i>I crawled into bed and held her.</i>

01:07:23.137 --> 01:07:24.806
The last thing I remember

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.706
<i>George standing at the cabin,</i>

01:07:27.708 --> 01:07:29.108
<i>watching us.</i>

01:07:29.110 --> 01:07:30.545
- He was watching you?
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:31.346 --> 01:07:32.579
<i>What about the morning?</i>

01:07:32.581 --> 01:07:33.880
<i>Isabelle woke me up.</i>

01:07:33.882 --> 01:07:35.017
<i>She told me
that George was gone.</i>

01:07:35.851 --> 01:07:37.650
<i>We were hoping
that he was out in the dinghy</i>

01:07:37.652 --> 01:07:39.418
<i>or that he had gone
to the beach for a swim.</i>

01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:41.123
- <i>That's it?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:07:42.456 --> 01:07:44.159
That's the last thing
I remember.

01:07:46.293 --> 01:07:47.629
<i>If George were to disappear,</i>

01:07:48.663 --> 01:07:50.132
would he do it like this?

01:07:52.333 --> 01:07:53.301
He's refined.

01:07:54.835 --> 01:07:56.237
There's too many mistakes.

01:07:57.338 --> 01:07:59.307
I don't know
what happened out there,

01:08:00.307 --> 01:08:02.277
but would he just leave us?

01:08:03.277 --> 01:08:05.580
No, not his style.

01:08:07.181 --> 01:08:08.783
You seem to know George
pretty well, Blake.

01:08:10.751 --> 01:08:12.721
More so than his wife
and his girlfriend.

01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:16.158
Have you ever heard

01:08:16.689 --> 01:08:19.661
of the trials and death
of Socrates?

01:08:23.296 --> 01:08:24.930
Socrates believed

01:08:24.932 --> 01:08:27.167
that he was
the smartest man in the world.

01:08:28.837 --> 01:08:31.340
The prosecutor asked,
"Why do you believe this?"

01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:34.706
Socrates said,

01:08:34.707 --> 01:08:37.444
"I know I am
the smartest man in the world,

01:08:38.479 --> 01:08:41.317
because I know
that I know nothing."

01:08:43.685 --> 01:08:45.321
What's the last thing
you saw, Blake?

01:08:46.688 --> 01:08:48.189
George standing over me.

01:08:48.721 --> 01:08:49.756
And?

01:08:50.492 --> 01:08:51.491
That's it.

01:08:51.493 --> 01:08:53.662
Tell me what you remember
from this morning?

01:08:55.662 --> 01:08:58.399
<i>I woke up with
a terrible headache, of course.</i>

01:09:00.533 --> 01:09:03.270
<i>And I went outside to get
some fresh air on my face.</i>

01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:08.609
<i>I notice Blake passed out.</i>

01:09:09.911 --> 01:09:12.778
<i>He had his heroin necklace
crushed open.</i>

01:09:12.779 --> 01:09:14.149
<i>There was a bandage on his head.</i>

01:09:15.515 --> 01:09:18.220
I looked around for George.
He was nowhere.

01:09:19.287 --> 01:09:21.386
<i>I waited up on the deck for him</i>

01:09:21.389 --> 01:09:23.323
<i>for about an hour or so.</i>

01:09:24.524 --> 01:09:27.630
I thought maybe
he would pop up out of the water

01:09:28.662 --> 01:09:30.231
<i>like he always did before.</i>

01:09:31.399 --> 01:09:32.635
<i>But he never did.</i>

01:09:34.502 --> 01:09:36.538
So, I woke up Cecile

01:09:37.270 --> 01:09:42.211
to help me look for him
on the beach, or in the water.

01:09:43.411 --> 01:09:44.380
<i>But he was gone.</i>

01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:51.683
<i>So, we called the harbor patrol.</i>

01:09:51.685 --> 01:09:52.919
He's just disappeared.

01:09:52.921 --> 01:09:54.722
We woke up and he was gone.

01:09:55.422 --> 01:09:57.225
<i>George has disappeared before.</i>

01:10:01.529 --> 01:10:02.831
This time's different?

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.801
<i>He's done this before, yes.</i>

01:10:09.371 --> 01:10:10.806
But never quite like this.

01:10:14.341 --> 01:10:15.743
Thank you, Isabelle.

01:10:17.511 --> 01:10:18.680
You're free to leave.

01:10:19.648 --> 01:10:21.613
<i>One more thing, Detective.</i>

01:10:21.615 --> 01:10:23.782
<i>If I know George the way I do,</i>

01:10:23.784 --> 01:10:24.853
<i>then he'll show up...</i>

01:10:26.354 --> 01:10:28.257
<i>in one form or another.</i>

01:10:28.989 --> 01:10:30.992
<i>George likes
to put people in situations</i>

01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:33.862
<i>and then see
how things play out.</i>

01:10:37.865 --> 01:10:40.569
<i>I guess four people
on the sailboat fits the bill.</i>

01:10:43.837 --> 01:10:46.638
<i>If you would've told me
I'd be sipping champagne</i>

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:47.973
<i>on a sailboat</i>

01:10:47.975 --> 01:10:49.209
<i>with a beautiful woman,</i>

01:10:49.211 --> 01:10:52.079
<i>I would've thought
I'd died and gone to Heaven.</i>

01:10:55.949 --> 01:10:57.619
<i>You just want control.</i>

01:11:05.092 --> 01:11:06.929
<i>We have a lot to talk about.</i>

01:11:13.335 --> 01:11:15.904
<i>One day I wanna
have a girl like you</i>

01:11:16.904 --> 01:11:18.105
<i>and a boat like that.</i>

01:11:20.108 --> 01:11:24.012
<i>Irony, the basis
by which all art exists.</i>

01:11:25.079 --> 01:11:26.879
<i>George doesn't do anything,</i>

01:11:26.881 --> 01:11:29.551
<i>and I mean anything,
without forethought.</i>

01:11:30.385 --> 01:11:31.787
<i>It's just not his nature.</i>

01:11:33.454 --> 01:11:35.524
<i>If this trip goes
according to my plan,</i>

01:11:36.056 --> 01:11:37.693
<i>maybe I'll like you too.</i>

01:11:39.927 --> 01:11:43.495
<i>I've already learned
that life is lonely, Detective.</i>

01:11:43.497 --> 01:11:44.897
<i>You misinterpreted.</i>

01:11:44.899 --> 01:11:46.699
<i>I'm just
his casual weekend friend.</i>

01:11:46.701 --> 01:11:48.500
<i>...just his casual
weekend friend.</i>

01:11:48.502 --> 01:11:50.635
<i>Isn't my master. Nobody is.</i>

01:11:50.637 --> 01:11:51.606
<i>Nobody is.</i>

01:11:54.109 --> 01:11:55.907
<i>We need uncertainty.</i>

01:11:55.909 --> 01:11:59.711
<i>We need something
to... to need, to possess.</i>

01:11:59.713 --> 01:12:03.018
<i>To give reason to all this
nothingness that surrounds you and I.</i>

01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:23.835
Yeah?

01:12:23.837 --> 01:12:25.840
<i>Still working?
Check your email.</i>

01:12:26.573 --> 01:12:28.676
- Why?
- <i>Just check.</i>

01:12:30.944 --> 01:12:33.012
Okay, I'm looking
at 'em right now.

01:12:33.014 --> 01:12:34.783
<i>There's two things worth noting.</i>

01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:36.616
What are they?

01:12:36.618 --> 01:12:39.184
<i>First, the attachment
in the email,</i>

01:12:39.186 --> 01:12:40.820
<i>I want you to listen to it.</i>

01:12:40.822 --> 01:12:42.921
<i>It's a voice memo recording
from his phone,</i>

01:12:42.923 --> 01:12:45.027
<i>and it's dated at 10:56 p.m.</i>

01:12:47.095 --> 01:12:47.996
You're kidding.

01:12:49.663 --> 01:12:51.065
What's the second thing?

01:12:51.765 --> 01:12:53.566
<i>The phone call
he made that morning</i>

01:12:53.568 --> 01:12:55.137
<i>was to J and E publishing.</i>

01:12:55.904 --> 01:12:57.503
<i>We're getting it
transcribed now.</i>

01:12:57.505 --> 01:12:59.108
<i>But I can tell you this.</i>

01:12:59.807 --> 01:13:01.609
<i>It was about the delivery
of his next novel.</i>

01:13:02.176 --> 01:13:03.844
<i>The publisher demanded it.</i>

01:13:09.751 --> 01:13:10.918
Thank you, Bailey.

01:13:12.186 --> 01:13:14.622
- Good work.
- <i>Night, Kenny.</i>

01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:25.000
Testing.
Testing. One, two, three.

01:13:27.668 --> 01:13:29.003
<i>Isabelle, are you okay?</i>

01:13:30.305 --> 01:13:32.170
<i>He thinks
he's gonna throw me overboard?</i>

01:13:32.172 --> 01:13:33.839
<i>He can hear us right now.</i>

01:13:33.841 --> 01:13:36.107
I will throw his ass overboard.

01:13:36.109 --> 01:13:39.781
<i>Blake,
what are you thinking? You can't...</i>

01:13:41.850 --> 01:13:43.452
<i>You know what? I have an idea.</i>

01:13:43.851 --> 01:13:45.554
<i>We should get rid of him.</i>

01:13:45.953 --> 01:13:47.986
- <i>No!</i>
- <i>We could...</i>

01:13:47.988 --> 01:13:51.022
<i>What if all three of us...?
What if we three...?</i>

01:13:51.024 --> 01:13:52.094
<i>No!</i>

01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:54.794
<i>I'd leave him if I could.</i>

01:13:54.796 --> 01:13:56.131
<i>I feel trapped.</i>

01:13:57.599 --> 01:13:59.034
<i>I could kill him.</i>

01:13:59.701 --> 01:14:00.735
<i>It's a possibility.</i>

01:14:01.769 --> 01:14:02.668
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:14:02.670 --> 01:14:03.736
<i>We're not gonna kill him.</i>

01:14:03.738 --> 01:14:05.271
<i>We shouldn't be talking
about this.</i>

01:14:05.273 --> 01:14:06.572
<i>I know you think about it, too.</i>

01:14:06.574 --> 01:14:09.942
<i>Yeah, I know,
but he's... He is... I just...</i>

01:14:09.944 --> 01:14:11.244
<i>Cecile, you can't...</i>

01:14:11.246 --> 01:14:12.948
<i>You don't agree with this,
do you?</i>

01:14:13.914 --> 01:14:14.946
<i>Do you?</i>

01:14:14.948 --> 01:14:16.048
<i>Look, he's...</i>

01:14:16.050 --> 01:14:18.084
<i>He's like a father
to me. He's...</i>

01:14:18.086 --> 01:14:20.218
<i>Blake, can you help?</i>

01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:21.222
<i>No!</i>

01:14:21.956 --> 01:14:22.854
<i>No!</i>

01:14:22.856 --> 01:14:24.525
<i>You could have the boat.</i>

01:14:25.158 --> 01:14:26.862
<i>I'm not doing this.</i>

01:14:32.867 --> 01:14:35.268
<i>Blake, Blake!</i>

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:36.572
<i>Fine.</i>

01:14:37.572 --> 01:14:38.803
<i>I'll do it.</i>

01:14:38.805 --> 01:14:40.839
<i>Look, I mean,</i>

01:14:40.841 --> 01:14:42.808
<i>if he's getting the boat,
and you're getting the money,</i>

01:14:42.810 --> 01:14:43.742
<i>what's left for me?</i>

01:14:43.744 --> 01:14:46.681
<i>Cecile, I'll give you the world.</i>

01:14:47.282 --> 01:14:50.252
<i>I just
don't even know what I want.</i>

01:14:51.719 --> 01:14:52.718
<i>How are we gonna do that?</i>

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:53.989
<i>We don't know
where he is.</i>

01:14:54.788 --> 01:14:56.692
<i>Do you hear him?</i>

01:14:58.059 --> 01:14:59.228
<i>Oh, here he comes!</i>

01:15:10.337 --> 01:15:13.004
Hey, when you get in
tomorrow morning,

01:15:13.006 --> 01:15:14.240
I'm gonna need
you to double check

01:15:14.242 --> 01:15:15.840
if there's
a Captain Cody on file

01:15:15.842 --> 01:15:17.546
at the Dana Point Harbor, okay?

01:15:22.984 --> 01:15:24.620
I think I figured it out.

01:15:46.908 --> 01:15:48.374
<i>When I begin a new story,</i>

01:15:48.376 --> 01:15:50.679
<i>I start
with choosing a location.</i>

01:15:51.279 --> 01:15:54.283
<i>It must have a compelling
and suggestive component to it.</i>

01:15:55.382 --> 01:15:57.183
<i>Time and space
need to be defined</i>

01:15:57.185 --> 01:15:59.087
<i>by its own
unique characteristics.</i>

01:16:01.722 --> 01:16:03.725
<i>I didn't choose to be this way.</i>

01:16:05.693 --> 01:16:07.329
<i>It is who I am.</i>

01:16:08.128 --> 01:16:10.765
<i>Always been. And always will be.</i>

01:16:17.971 --> 01:16:19.041
<i>I am...</i>

01:16:19.907 --> 01:16:20.943
<i>a writer.</i>

01:16:24.212 --> 01:16:26.281
<i>Moving from place to place.</i>

01:16:28.048 --> 01:16:30.252
<i>Shifting from idea to new idea.</i>

01:16:37.759 --> 01:16:39.860
<i>Looking for my next book.</i>
