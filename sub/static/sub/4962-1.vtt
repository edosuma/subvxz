Hey. Hey, wake up.

03:21.497 --> 03:23.510
Who the hell are you?

03:24.466 --> 03:26.836
Come on, you gotta get up.

03:27.702 --> 03:29.911
Who the hell are you?

03:32.941 --> 03:36.344
What do you mean who the hell am...
I'm sleeping here. Who the hell are you?

03:36.444 --> 03:39.582
Yeah, I see that, but you gotta get up.
Come on. Get up.

03:39.982 --> 03:43.323

- Monday.

03:43.952 --> 03:45.759
Monday?

03:47.756 --> 03:52.428
- Come on, get up. Let's go.
- Yeah, it's okay. It's alright.

03:52.528 --> 03:56.350
It's not alright. Get up.
You gotta get up. Come on. Let's go.

03:56.450 --> 03:59.688
Sheila's a friend of mine.
She lives here. I always stay here.

03:59.788 --> 04:01.575
- I don't know who Sheila is.
- It's okay. It's fine.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.939
- Whoever was here was evicted, alright?
- It's fine, it's fine.

04:04.039 --> 04:07.013
It's not fine.
Come on, get up. Let's go.

04:09.411 --> 04:11.218
Monday.

04:17.952 --> 04:20.961
- What're you doin'?
- She's comin' back.

04:22.089 --> 04:24.863
- There's nobody comin' back, buddy.
- She told me she's coming back.

04:24.963 --> 04:27.053
I'm just gonna wait here.

04:27.153 --> 04:32.203
There's nobody here. Didn't you notice
nobody lives here? How'd you get in here?

04:35.671 --> 04:37.540
Hey, listen to me, buddy,
you got two minutes, alright?

04:37.640 --> 04:42.211
- Do what you gotta do, then you gotta go.
- No, no, no, no, no, no. No.

04:42.311 --> 04:44.714
Can't do. There are laws.

04:44.814 --> 04:48.551
She's gonna take you to court case. No.

04:48.651 --> 04:50.553
Cannot do.

04:50.653 --> 04:53.957
She's comin' back here soon.
She'll be fine.

04:54.057 --> 04:57.960
- Alright, that's it. You gotta go.
- I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

04:58.060 --> 05:01.764
I wanna stay here. She wanted me
to wait here for her.

05:01.864 --> 05:03.566
- So I'll stay here.
- Nobody comin' back.

05:03.666 --> 05:06.420
- You wanna wait, wait outside.
- She's comin' back. She's not gonna lie to me.

05:06.520 --> 05:10.106
I'm here with her. This is my home.
This... this is my home.

05:10.206 --> 05:15.337
Wait outside. You don't live here,
alright? I'm serious.

05:21.549 --> 05:23.286
What're you doin'?

05:23.586 --> 05:27.223
Did... did she...
Did she leave a number?

05:27.323 --> 05:31.093
- I don't even know who you're talking about?
- An address or something? Anything?

05:31.193 --> 05:33.429
- No. Time to go.
- Sheila.

05:33.529 --> 05:35.365
Let's go.

05:40.568 --> 05:44.942
Well, where's my...
where's my stuff? Where's my stuff?

05:45.042 --> 05:47.943
I don't know where your stuff is.
Look around and then you gotta get out.

05:48.043 --> 05:49.850
Come on.

06:22.310 --> 06:24.447
- Hey.
- Is everything alright?

06:24.547 --> 06:27.854
- Yeah. It's a pigsty.
- You're kidding, right?

06:28.182 --> 06:30.329
No, I'm tellin' you.

06:31.085 --> 06:33.056
Well, I'm goin' upstairs now.

06:33.156 --> 06:37.562
The whole ceiling has collapsed...

06:38.027 --> 06:40.634
Hold on. I'll call you back.

06:42.297 --> 06:44.043
Hello?

06:45.868 --> 06:48.108
Anybody in there?

06:54.308 --> 06:56.083
Hello?

07:02.885 --> 07:04.925
Anybody home?

07:11.860 --> 07:13.667
Hello?

07:21.336 --> 07:23.110
Hello?

07:53.134 --> 07:55.705
What do you want me to say?
I mean, he's your dad too.

07:55.805 --> 08:00.006
He's gotta eat.
If he doesn't eat, then what?

08:04.512 --> 08:06.916
You have to stay there.

08:07.016 --> 08:11.254
It takes him, like, an hour and half
but that's what it takes.

08:11.604 --> 08:13.889
- 2500?
- I said 2500.

08:13.989 --> 08:16.525
- Oh, give me a fuckin' break.
- Give you a break?

08:16.625 --> 08:22.332
This guy. Not now, buddy. I told you,
I'm sorry. I can't help you, alright?

08:23.132 --> 08:25.941
I just wondered, could I borrow
some money? Someone took my wallet.

08:26.041 --> 08:28.237
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry whatever happened.

08:28.337 --> 08:31.475
I just wanna find my lady.
I wanna find her...

08:31.575 --> 08:35.017
You're not gonna find her here.
I told you she's gone. What are you doin'?

08:35.116 --> 08:40.119
- What are you doin'? Come on.
- Thank you, mister. Thank you.

08:41.783 --> 08:44.954
- What the fuck did you do that for?
- What do you care?

08:45.454 --> 08:49.425
Come on, work with me, alright?
I can't do it for less than 4500.

08:49.525 --> 08:51.894
- 2500.
- You want half a job?

08:51.994 --> 08:54.029
- Look, just do it for 25.
- You want me to do half the work?

08:54.129 --> 08:58.033
What... Look, just do it for 25.
You know, put me down for 25.

08:58.133 --> 09:00.807
You know? You think you can.

09:02.270 --> 09:04.039
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

09:04.139 --> 09:05.979
You're welcome.

09:35.470 --> 09:36.906
Yeah.

09:37.006 --> 09:41.510
You know there are options.
I've told you that so many times.

09:41.610 --> 09:45.246
You know what?
You and me, we need to go out.

09:45.346 --> 09:48.784
Tonight. We can go... I'm sorry?

09:48.884 --> 09:53.627
How about Saturday?
Me and you, we can hit that spot...

10:02.830 --> 10:05.095
How crazy is that?

10:27.321 --> 10:29.029
Hey.

10:41.603 --> 10:43.494
Hello.

10:45.140 --> 10:46.846
Yes.

10:49.610 --> 10:51.782
Who is it?

10:55.662 --> 10:57.749
Quién es?

11:00.523 --> 11:06.021
- Stop ringing that bell whoever you are.
- I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

11:09.597 --> 11:14.473
It's just some guy. Don't worry about it.
Relax. I'm gonna take care of it, alright?

11:14.573 --> 11:16.342
Thanks.

11:16.504 --> 11:18.712
Jesus Christ!

11:31.919 --> 11:33.922
Hey. Hey!

11:34.022 --> 11:36.425
- Come on. Wake up.
- Oh, good. I wanted to talk to you.

11:36.525 --> 11:39.061
I spoke to Sheila. I spoke to Sheila.

11:39.161 --> 11:42.898
She said, you know, that we should
stay here and wait with her. She's...

11:42.998 --> 11:45.367
- Wait outside, okay?
- She... she's...

11:45.467 --> 11:49.641
- Come on. You gotta get up.
- I spoke to her. She was on a payphone.

11:51.339 --> 11:55.110
Go outside and wait. You can't wait here.
You can't sleep here.

11:55.210 --> 11:58.952
You cannot come back here.
Alright? Let's go. Come on.

12:00.614 --> 12:03.162
Hey. You alright?

12:04.719 --> 12:06.748
What's the matter?

12:08.523 --> 12:10.325
- Hey, look.
- Cut me some slack, man.

12:10.425 --> 12:14.473
Come on. Come on. I'm not bothering
anybody. I'm not bothering anybody.

12:14.573 --> 12:17.405
You're scaring the neighbors.
Alright? Come on.

13:43.951 --> 13:46.026
Get some sleep.

14:27.728 --> 14:29.765
Okay, okay.

14:29.865 --> 14:32.697
Get some sleep. Get some sleep.

14:35.302 --> 14:37.366
Get some sleep.

14:54.556 --> 14:57.027
- Go!
- Jesus!

14:58.192 --> 15:00.834
- Hey!
- You nailed him!

15:26.629 --> 15:28.736
I don't think so.

15:28.836 --> 15:31.323
- Really?
- No.

15:32.893 --> 15:36.403
Do you think we could, please?

15:37.636 --> 15:39.468
Hey. Hey, guys.
Could I borrow some money?

15:39.568 --> 15:42.637
Hey, somebody stole my wallet.
I just I want to get a metro card.

15:42.737 --> 15:44.799
I just need it for a metro card,
that's all.

16:25.836 --> 16:30.201
Bird and the bees.
If you horny, you horny.

16:30.552 --> 16:33.489
Now, look. I get horny. Oh, now...

16:33.889 --> 16:38.360
Keep your belongings in sight
at all times. Protect yourself.

16:38.460 --> 16:43.002
If you see a suspicious package
or activity on the platform or train...

16:48.370 --> 16:51.435
Can I just have your attention
for a couple of minutes.

16:51.535 --> 16:54.042
I just need a little bit of help.

16:54.442 --> 16:57.846
I have a couple of small children
and I wanna go and visit my husband

16:57.946 --> 17:02.618
who hasn't seen the kids in a while.
He's not doing that well.

17:03.318 --> 17:05.791
Have it in your hearts
to just give me a little something.

18:02.810 --> 18:04.545
Shit.

18:14.655 --> 18:16.880
If you want to calm
your anxiety in your case,

18:16.980 --> 18:20.595
you try to lose a bit of weight,
it could be whatever you like.

18:20.695 --> 18:23.265
One thing you can do is...

18:23.365 --> 18:25.634
run it through water, running water

18:25.734 --> 18:28.759
or if you're going camping,
in a river...

18:30.541 --> 18:32.507
- Happy.
- Really?

18:32.607 --> 18:35.644
- Am I making you happy?
- Yeah.

18:35.744 --> 18:38.280
Are you sure? You were saying,
"No, no, no, no, no."

18:38.380 --> 18:40.883
I thought I was making you mad.

18:40.983 --> 18:43.381
I thought I was making you mad.

19:20.287 --> 19:22.366
Stop, stop.

19:22.875 --> 19:26.261
- Oh, well, that's a friendly hello.
- Yeah.

19:26.761 --> 19:30.809
- I needed a little bit of the old...
- You like that? Do that again.

19:30.909 --> 19:33.035
Do that again, do it again. Do it again.

19:33.135 --> 19:37.277
Kiss one of these? Kiss one of those.
It's pretty much a sweet spot, so...

19:40.641 --> 19:42.744
So bloody good.

19:42.844 --> 19:44.479
- They love music.
- The women are beautiful.

19:44.579 --> 19:48.838
They actually care.
Not like here. They...

19:49.138 --> 19:51.163
They don't care as much about...

19:52.854 --> 19:54.628
Robert?

19:55.222 --> 19:56.949
Robert.

20:01.562 --> 20:06.146
Robert? Vanilla half caff soy latte.

20:10.671 --> 20:13.308
You're gonna be around
next time I come back?

20:13.408 --> 20:15.343
Yeah.

20:15.443 --> 20:17.646
I'm kind of constantly around,
it's funny.

20:17.746 --> 20:20.482
Yeah? Well, it's good to know.

20:20.582 --> 20:22.383
Yo.

20:22.883 --> 20:24.814
Man.

20:25.220 --> 20:27.716
Look, I feel like you're gonna be late.

20:27.816 --> 20:31.164
- No, that's okay.
- I'm gonna be late, man.

20:31.264 --> 20:34.529
- You should come have a drink with me.
- Oh, no, I can't, babe. I got to go.

20:34.629 --> 20:38.472
I got responsibilities and such. But...

20:42.069 --> 20:44.422
- But I got...
- Just stay.

20:44.939 --> 20:47.447
Got to grab a taxi.

20:49.682 --> 20:50.627
Alright, call me up.

20:50.727 --> 20:54.116
Alright. But I promise I will call you
when I get back to the city, alright?

20:54.216 --> 20:57.057
- Yeah, it was fun.
- Alright.

21:04.759 --> 21:08.501
No, okay, well... put her on the phone.

21:10.131 --> 21:12.767
Yeah, yeah, yeah, please.

21:12.867 --> 21:15.374
- Hold on.
- Okay.

21:16.503 --> 21:18.713
No, come on.

21:19.574 --> 21:21.347
I'm serious.

21:22.175 --> 21:24.156
Hold on.

21:24.713 --> 21:26.717
- Hello?
- I'm back.

21:26.817 --> 21:30.686
I wanna go...
Hey, I can't really talk right now.

21:35.556 --> 21:37.392
Yeah.

21:37.492 --> 21:39.561
I've got a... I've got a...

21:39.661 --> 21:43.971
I've got a drink inside.
What? What is it?

21:52.673 --> 21:55.577
I agree. It's... it is very important.

21:55.677 --> 21:58.329
It's just now is not a good time.

21:58.847 --> 22:03.556
What? What is it? What do you...
what do you want to say?

22:05.620 --> 22:08.937
Hey! You alright?

22:10.358 --> 22:13.995
- You're waiting for somebody or what?
- No, no, no.

22:14.095 --> 22:16.064
- Can I help you?
- No. No, no, no. No.

22:16.164 --> 22:20.873
You can... have right now? I'm just...

22:22.703 --> 22:25.553
Out. I'm... out, out.

22:27.007 --> 22:29.511
Yes! Yes!

22:29.711 --> 22:32.348
Reinforcements have arrived.

22:32.514 --> 22:34.514
- How are you? You're good?
- I'm good.

22:34.614 --> 22:39.058
Misunderstanding 'cause I don't think
I was accusing you of anything.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.470
The way that I talk to you?

22:55.570 --> 22:59.140
I was just upset.
It's like 2 in the morning and...

22:59.240 --> 23:04.612
I want to go to bed with you
and not wanting to fight.

23:04.712 --> 23:08.049
- Let me talk to you a second.
- Sorry. You want to talk?

23:08.149 --> 23:11.092
- No, I'm talking to someone.
- Hold on a second.

23:13.921 --> 23:16.577
You see the barmaid, the blonde?

23:21.294 --> 23:25.400
Would you give these to her?
It'll make her very happy.

23:25.500 --> 23:28.603
- You want me to give these to this...
- Yeah. It's good. It's good.

23:28.703 --> 23:30.569
It's good.

23:31.239 --> 23:34.209
- What is this?
- It's good. You give them to her.

23:34.309 --> 23:36.130
Okay.

23:36.230 --> 23:41.004
- Okay?
- Yeah, I just... okay. Thank you.

23:41.316 --> 23:43.122
Shit.

23:43.517 --> 23:48.156
Someone just gave me pictures to give
to... look, I got to go. It's loud.

23:48.256 --> 23:51.393
There's fire trucks
and I'm just gonna go, okay?

23:51.493 --> 23:54.162
I'm... let me call you... let me
call you when I'm done, okay?

23:54.262 --> 23:57.331
I'll call you... I'll call you
when I'm leaving.

23:57.431 --> 24:00.719
Okay? Okay. Okay.

24:10.043 --> 24:11.613
- Maggie.
- Yep.

24:11.713 --> 24:14.768
This guy gave me
these pictures to give you.

24:16.683 --> 24:18.758
Is that you?

24:22.289 --> 24:25.511
This... this little girl,
looks like you.

24:27.528 --> 24:29.568
What?

24:30.931 --> 24:32.935
What are they?

24:33.535 --> 24:35.451
You alright?

24:35.737 --> 24:37.997
Yeah, I'm all good.

24:38.873 --> 24:41.280
We need pint glasses.

24:42.209 --> 24:45.585
Get it. Go. Make it happen.

25:04.431 --> 25:05.349
Hi. What's up?

25:05.449 --> 25:07.982
Just watch me, okay?
This homeless guy is in here.

25:08.082 --> 25:10.438
Oh, for cryin' out loud.
You want me to come in there?

25:10.538 --> 25:14.008
- No, I want you to watch.
- What am I watching?

25:14.108 --> 25:16.732
If my throat gets slit, you tell my mother
it was because you were too lazy

25:16.832 --> 25:18.823
to come in here.

25:19.414 --> 25:22.233
- I'm gonna... I'll come in there...
- No! Don't! Are you crazy?

25:22.333 --> 25:24.800
Don't leave Tucker in the car
by himself. Just watch me.

25:24.900 --> 25:29.433
I told you I could pick up the money in
the morning. How does that make me lazy?

25:31.224 --> 25:34.267
- What's happening?
- You want some help?

25:36.163 --> 25:38.371
What's happening?

27:05.118 --> 27:06.859
Sir?

27:07.521 --> 27:10.258
Sir, wake up. You alright?

27:10.358 --> 27:13.067
You're in the emergency room.

27:14.061 --> 27:15.763
- You okay?
- Yeah.

27:15.863 --> 27:18.151
You feeling alright?

27:22.435 --> 27:24.829
Yeah. I'm fine, I'm fine.

27:27.608 --> 27:30.372
Sir, do you remember how you got here?

27:34.415 --> 27:37.240
Are you waiting for anyone, love?

27:39.620 --> 27:42.066
Yeah, yeah, yes.

27:42.166 --> 27:45.760
I guess they left already.
I fell asleep.

27:45.860 --> 27:50.792
- Well, can I help you in any way?
- No, no, I'm fine. I'll be fine. Thank you.

28:29.602 --> 28:32.106
You know there's a food pantry
in the mornin'

28:32.206 --> 28:35.501
at St. Bart's on 51st Street
if you're hungry.

28:36.409 --> 28:40.695
When I call, they usually bring around
some food about half five at night.

28:42.182 --> 28:44.610
No, I don't, I...

28:46.219 --> 28:50.592
I think I better go home.
I'm just a little bit...

28:54.761 --> 28:59.164
Sheila is gonna be worried sick.
I better get back.

29:02.903 --> 29:07.234
You don't have to go. You can stay.
No one will bother you here.

29:07.334 --> 29:10.372
Don't tell anybody I told you
that though, okay?

29:16.650 --> 29:20.909
My grandmother
on my mother's side was Irish.

29:29.396 --> 29:31.604
Just enough.

29:32.699 --> 29:34.969
Do you like it here?

29:35.069 --> 29:37.772
- You mean the hospital or...
- No, no, no, America.

29:37.872 --> 29:41.299
You know, your accent. You haven't
been here very long, have you?

29:41.999 --> 29:43.211
- Long enough.
- Yeah.

29:43.311 --> 29:45.780
No, I like it here.
I like it when I can get some sleep

29:45.880 --> 29:48.249
which should be hopefully very soon.

29:48.349 --> 29:50.122
Yeah.

29:53.086 --> 29:54.793
Yeah.

29:59.059 --> 30:00.941
You know...

30:01.041 --> 30:04.513
I've always been really,
very good with women.

30:05.132 --> 30:07.471
Women have always...

30:07.571 --> 30:10.641
been incredibly kind to me.

30:13.440 --> 30:16.811
And... I really have no...

30:16.911 --> 30:19.852
place to go right now and...

30:21.281 --> 30:25.118
I'm not a bum. I'm clean.
I'm a very, very clean guy.

30:25.631 --> 30:27.889
I'm not a bad guest, really.

30:27.989 --> 30:30.596
I just... I'm in between.

30:32.525 --> 30:34.233
Sorry.

31:28.281 --> 31:30.184
See you next week.

31:30.284 --> 31:32.553
- Alright.
- Okay, later.

31:32.653 --> 31:34.860
Yeah, see you later.

32:03.767 --> 32:06.921
...and all those other terrorist
groups are watching all this.

32:07.021 --> 32:11.089
How the Hollywood media is doing...
it's getting into our homes and our...

32:19.199 --> 32:21.039
Okay.

33:04.712 --> 33:07.482
She said she's gonna look
over my resume.

33:07.582 --> 33:11.285
Well, they should get back to me,
I guess, in a day or so.

33:11.886 --> 33:14.259
I know. I hope I get in too.

33:23.396 --> 33:24.932
- No.
- No?

33:25.032 --> 33:27.068
It's a little bright.

33:27.168 --> 33:29.904
Are you here for English
as a second language?

33:30.004 --> 33:32.106
Meditation Mondays?

33:32.206 --> 33:34.998
Oh, I'm just looking for a coat.

34:08.975 --> 34:12.447
Hey! Hey, listen, you can't stay here.

34:12.547 --> 34:14.415
- It's not a Code Blue night.
- It's okay. It's alright.

34:14.514 --> 34:17.034
- No, it's not a Code Blue night.
- I'm just sitting here.

34:17.134 --> 34:22.389
No, no, no. No, you can sleep here
if it's 32 degrees below.

34:22.489 --> 34:26.551
- But it's not 32 degrees below. Come on.
- Do you need to see a doctor?

34:26.650 --> 34:28.760
- No, he does not...
- If you're not feeling well...

34:28.860 --> 34:31.237
- If you need some medical treatment.
- What temperature is it outside?

34:31.338 --> 34:33.900
It's more than 32.
You have to go. I'm sorry, sir.

34:34.001 --> 34:36.824
- There's wind chill. No.
- Please, sir.

34:36.925 --> 34:38.936
- There's a really bad wind.
- No. Listen...

34:39.036 --> 34:42.076
I can't do anything about it.
Please don't make my life miserable.

34:42.176 --> 34:45.213
- I'm not bothering anybody here.
- It does not mat...

34:45.313 --> 34:46.914
- Do you know where Bellevue is?
- You can stay here.

34:47.014 --> 34:48.949
The homeless intake center? Go there.

34:49.050 --> 34:52.686
- It's 30th and 1st Avenue.
- I can't believe this. There's nobody here.

34:52.786 --> 34:54.822
It doesn't matter.
I don't wanna get in trouble.

34:54.922 --> 34:58.459
I'm sorry, sir, about your situation.
Just please go.

34:58.559 --> 35:01.333
- I don't wanna have to call the cops.
- Sorry.

35:01.694 --> 35:03.564
Thank you.

35:03.964 --> 35:06.132
What? I can't. No.

35:08.268 --> 35:11.105
And I said... I told her, I told her.

35:11.205 --> 35:13.975
A couple of days ago my husband
found out where I live.

35:14.075 --> 35:16.944
And he tossed me around the kitchen
and I hurt my back too.

35:17.044 --> 35:18.847
Come on.

35:19.547 --> 35:22.488
And I told her and I was hurt.

35:41.868 --> 35:44.776
That's it. I made a mistake.

35:44.937 --> 35:48.180
I made a mistake. Stupid.

36:03.323 --> 36:06.828
As you enter the facility
please take all outerwear off.

36:06.928 --> 36:10.031
Belts off.
All items out of your pockets.

36:10.131 --> 36:12.466
Remove all hats, scarves.

36:12.566 --> 36:15.903
Any unauthorized items,
please get rid of them now.

36:16.003 --> 36:18.472
As soon as your stuff
goes through the machine

36:18.572 --> 36:21.075
an officer will instruct you
to walk through the metal detector.

36:21.175 --> 36:24.160
Once your stuff is cleared from the x-ray
machine please bring the bin back,

36:24.260 --> 36:28.120
get yourself set up and ready
for check in. Thank you.

36:29.550 --> 36:32.057
One at a time. One at a time.

36:41.662 --> 36:45.542
Sir, please remember to remove all items
and your belt please. Thank you.

36:48.434 --> 36:52.609
Look, all I... I'm just looking for a...
place for a couple of nights

36:52.709 --> 36:55.409
'cause it's over 32 degrees outside.

36:55.509 --> 36:59.379
- Look... that's...
- Just a little while.

36:59.920 --> 37:03.972
That's not what I'm asking.
Okay? I'm looking for your name.

37:04.072 --> 37:07.694
I wanna see if you've been already
assigned a shelter. Don't bust my balls.

37:07.794 --> 37:09.835
No, no, I'm sorry. I...

37:09.935 --> 37:12.960
Look, can I just get...
a bed for one night.

37:13.060 --> 37:16.854
- Do you have any form of ID?
- No. I don't.

37:17.397 --> 37:21.335
Do you have anybody you can call? Anybody
you could stay with? A friend's couch?

37:21.435 --> 37:24.610
- I don't have... I don't have anyone.
- Nothing?

37:26.674 --> 37:29.589
Look, are you filled up or something?
Bec... is that...

37:29.689 --> 37:32.146
I could come back later
if it's... if that's better.

37:32.246 --> 37:34.142
- There's no later.
- No.

37:34.242 --> 37:36.267
The law says we have to give you a bed.

37:36.367 --> 37:40.362
Yeah. Okay. Well, I could...

37:40.462 --> 37:43.257
Any place is fine. Anything you got.
I mean the floor is fine with me.

37:43.357 --> 37:47.695
I just need a blanket. A blanket
makes me sleep better. I like a blanket.

37:47.995 --> 37:50.923
- Okay, you'll stay here tonight in a bed.
- Okay. Good.

37:51.023 --> 37:55.574
We'll evaluate you. If you qualify,
you'll be assigned a permanent shelter.

37:56.436 --> 37:58.005
A what?

37:58.105 --> 38:01.675
- A place where you could stay.
- Permanent?

38:01.775 --> 38:04.583
It's up to you. We have all kinds.

38:08.915 --> 38:13.795
It's been a long time since I had a job.
It's been many years. I'm...

38:14.595 --> 38:18.336
I'm too old to be hired.
No one's gonna hire me like...

38:18.436 --> 38:23.730
not like I am. I'm just... I'm...
I'm really no good right now.

38:24.230 --> 38:25.837
Well...

38:27.233 --> 38:28.876
Look at me, man.

38:29.236 --> 38:32.139
9/11 blew my brains out.
I had to crawl out of a ditch.

38:32.239 --> 38:34.413
If you know what I mean.

38:37.910 --> 38:40.425
I don't know what you mean.

38:41.215 --> 38:43.822
I was on your side of the glass once.

38:44.250 --> 38:45.958
Yeah.

38:46.786 --> 38:48.889
So how much is it?

38:48.989 --> 38:51.325
- What?
- A bed, how much is a bed tonight?

38:51.425 --> 38:52.860
- For one night?
- No. Listen...

38:52.960 --> 38:55.626
'Cause I don't have much.
I don't have... I don't have...

38:55.726 --> 38:59.099
Matter of fact I don't have anything.
I'm kind of in between...

38:59.199 --> 39:01.081
Have a seat.

39:01.567 --> 39:02.519
Why?

39:02.619 --> 39:06.941
I'll kill you! I don't care! You can
give me the death penalty. I don't care!

39:07.041 --> 39:10.744
What up, man? Look,
back up off me, back up off me!

39:10.844 --> 39:12.746
- You don't care about me!
- Are you okay?

39:12.846 --> 39:16.796
They sent me here. He says I gotta go back!
That's not fair! That's not fair!

39:16.896 --> 39:20.221
You're not listening to me.
Listen to what I'm saying!

39:20.321 --> 39:23.791
Listen! He said that
I'm supposed to come here.

39:23.891 --> 39:26.545
They sent me here! They sent me...

39:26.645 --> 39:28.896
Back up! Back up off me, okay?

39:28.996 --> 39:31.858
- Listen to what I'm saying!
- I don't care! I'm out of here.

39:31.958 --> 39:34.668
He said if I go back,
I'm gonna kill you!

39:34.768 --> 39:37.462
Look, you're not listening to me.

39:37.562 --> 39:39.907
What are you doing?

39:40.007 --> 39:43.711
I can't do that. I'll kill him.
I swear I'll kill him.

39:43.811 --> 39:48.582
- I got diabetes. He don't care! He don't care!
- Can we get you somethin' to eat?

39:48.682 --> 39:52.119
He don't even got that.
He don't respect me.

39:52.219 --> 39:53.921
They sent me from...

39:54.021 --> 39:57.791
They said come here.
They said come here. He said go back.

39:57.891 --> 40:00.494
He said after one more night
I can come back here.

40:00.594 --> 40:02.930
- I got diabetes.
- Damn it. Fuck!

40:03.030 --> 40:05.099
He's trying to kill me!

40:05.199 --> 40:07.568
Where did you live last?

40:07.668 --> 40:10.771
I... I've been moving around
for a while.

40:10.871 --> 40:15.409
No, sweetie, where...
did you come from... before here?

40:15.509 --> 40:18.012
- Where was the last place you resided...
- Sheila's.

40:18.112 --> 40:21.025
Oh, Sheila. So where's Sheila?

40:22.915 --> 40:24.118
Queens? I don't know.

40:24.218 --> 40:27.588
- Could you go back there and stay...
- No, no, she was gone. She was evicted.

40:27.688 --> 40:31.024
She... she... she didn't say goodbye.

40:31.124 --> 40:33.594
She didn't take it to court.
She didn't do anything.

40:33.694 --> 40:35.729
Stupid cow. She knew
I had no place to go.

40:35.829 --> 40:39.800
Okay, so no staying with the cow.

40:39.900 --> 40:42.507
How about family? You got a family?

40:47.873 --> 40:52.549
If I say I have a family
does that mean I can still stay here?

40:52.649 --> 40:56.788
Yes, unless they'd be willing
to take you in.

40:57.784 --> 41:00.469
- I don't have a family.
- Okay, come on, darling...

41:00.569 --> 41:04.116
You would much rather stay
with your family than stay here,

41:04.216 --> 41:05.759
you understand what I'm sayin'?

41:05.859 --> 41:09.334
Mr. Hammer, please,
trust me on that one.

41:09.762 --> 41:12.733
Hammond, Hammond, George Hammond.

41:12.833 --> 41:16.837
- Sorry, darlin'. I'll change that one.
- I just want a bed to sleep on.

41:16.937 --> 41:21.242
I don't have enough money to stay
in a hotel. I don't have a family.

41:21.342 --> 41:25.283
You never married?
Handsome man like yourself.

41:28.382 --> 41:30.521
I'm not handsome.

41:31.284 --> 41:33.325
Maybe I was.

41:35.788 --> 41:38.025
I was married once.

41:38.325 --> 41:40.592
She's no longer with me.

41:41.761 --> 41:44.431
- Breasts.
- Excuse me?

41:44.531 --> 41:47.122
Breast. She had breast cancer.
One. Then the other one.

41:47.222 --> 41:49.703
She's... she died. She's gone.

41:49.803 --> 41:52.206
- Sorry about that.
- It's okay.

41:52.306 --> 41:55.561
It's alright. We had been
divorced for many years.

41:56.243 --> 41:59.765
How about children?
You got any children?

42:01.247 --> 42:03.015
One.

42:03.415 --> 42:04.471
One girl.

42:06.886 --> 42:10.357
Daughter. She know you're here?

42:11.382 --> 42:13.439
Give her a call?

42:13.861 --> 42:17.331
Yeah, daughters and daddy's
special relationship.

42:17.431 --> 42:20.584
I love my daddy, sure did.

42:20.684 --> 42:22.369
He was...

42:22.469 --> 42:26.673
I just worshiped the ground he walked on.
He could do no wrong in my eyes.

42:26.773 --> 42:28.575
He was a rock.

42:28.675 --> 42:33.285
I don't know where she is.
I... haven't seen her in a while.

42:34.681 --> 42:37.517
Anyway she doesn't want me.
She doesn't...

42:37.851 --> 42:41.535
She wouldn't want me. She's not one
of those daughters. She doesn't...

42:41.635 --> 42:47.499
adore me. She doesn't...
worship the ground I walk on. I...

42:50.029 --> 42:52.899
I didn't pay much attention to her.

42:52.999 --> 42:55.840
My mind was on somethin' else.

42:57.303 --> 43:00.337
On somethin' else? Like what?

43:06.812 --> 43:11.089
I'm just a fuck up. Probably always was.

43:12.718 --> 43:15.374
Alright. So...

43:15.474 --> 43:20.485
are you and have you been addicted
to any legal or illegal substances?

43:20.585 --> 43:22.867
And please don't lie.

43:24.397 --> 43:27.000
I just want a place to sleep, please.

43:27.100 --> 43:30.566
- We will have to do a psychiatric evaluation.
- I just want a place to sleep...

43:30.666 --> 43:32.306
I'm addicted to sleep.

43:32.406 --> 43:38.445
And you will be evaluated
with the social history within...

43:38.545 --> 43:42.280
I'm gettin' the idea, I don't feel like
you want me to be here. Is that true?

43:42.380 --> 43:44.751
'Cause I'm feelin' like
you want me to go away.

43:44.851 --> 43:48.389
- I want what's best for you.
- You want what's...

43:48.489 --> 43:53.126
You have no idea who I am. You don't
know me. How can you possibly...

43:53.226 --> 43:55.863
How are you gonna know
what's best for me?

43:55.963 --> 43:58.971
Why do you think I'm asking you
all these questions?

44:01.901 --> 44:04.137
Look, I am starving, I...

44:04.237 --> 44:07.875
I need to sleep. I have no answers.

44:07.975 --> 44:10.177
Put down anything you want,
I'm sure you know...

44:10.277 --> 44:12.212
- Do you see this?
- ...all the answers to everything.

44:12.312 --> 44:15.282
These are meal vouchers.

44:15.382 --> 44:18.151
Okay? Now, I can give you one of these.

44:18.251 --> 44:21.989
You get a meal,
let you back into the shelter.

44:22.089 --> 44:26.393
Missed dinner, but you're gonna have
breakfast tomorrow at 6 a.m.

44:26.493 --> 44:30.268
And if you're really good,
I might get you a sandwich.

44:31.697 --> 44:34.968
- Okay.
- But I need you to answer my questions.

44:35.068 --> 44:37.738
You willing to answer my questions?

44:37.838 --> 44:40.373
Come on, handsome.

44:40.473 --> 44:42.689
Answer my questions.

44:46.746 --> 44:52.052
- What room were you assigned?
- To W... room 72.

44:52.152 --> 44:53.792
Up the stairs, to the right.

45:21.413 --> 45:23.355
Excuse me.

46:54.506 --> 46:56.643
Alright, wake up.

46:56.743 --> 46:59.517
Let's go, time to wake up.

48:31.570 --> 48:34.612
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

49:00.532 --> 49:02.502
The world is not gonna help you!

49:02.602 --> 49:06.210
God will help you! God cares about you.

50:02.761 --> 50:04.697
No, no, no, they sent me from Bellevue.

50:04.797 --> 50:06.566
- You got any food on you, man?
- No, no, no.

50:06.666 --> 50:08.268
You bring any food in, you're out.

50:08.368 --> 50:11.107
No fighting, no spilling,
no stealing and no sex.

50:11.207 --> 50:14.174
Curfew's at 10:30.
Snooze, you lose your bed.

50:14.274 --> 50:16.408
Out by 8 a.m.

50:16.508 --> 50:18.278
Go upstairs.

50:18.378 --> 50:20.351
Hey, come here.

52:00.879 --> 52:04.425
- Hey, man, time's up.
- Sorry.

52:04.525 --> 52:07.854
White ass, there ain't
no time limit on showers.

52:07.954 --> 52:09.789
What are you?
You the water authority all of a sudden?

52:09.889 --> 52:13.230
Hey, I'm sick and tired
of waiting, okay?

52:13.492 --> 52:15.795
Yo, man, you ain't got to lie...

52:15.895 --> 52:20.238
I don't know him. I don't know.
Mind your own business.

52:32.244 --> 52:34.981
- What?
- It's my bed.

52:35.081 --> 52:38.018
- No, it's not...
- It's my bed, it's my bed.

52:38.118 --> 52:41.709
They gave it to me.
I just got here. Okay?

52:56.034 --> 52:58.042
I'm Jack.

53:04.610 --> 53:07.084
It's nice to meet you too.

53:08.113 --> 53:10.867
What's the matter?
You afraid of me, newbie?

53:11.483 --> 53:13.825
You afraid of me, newbie?

53:15.154 --> 53:17.662
Afraid I'll take your things?

53:19.058 --> 53:21.893
Afraid I'd fuck you up or something?

53:23.662 --> 53:26.133
Why would I fuck with you?

53:26.633 --> 53:30.348
No, you fuck up, you go
to next step shelter which is...

53:30.448 --> 53:34.400
you know, last step shelter really and then
you're up shit creek without a paddle.

53:34.500 --> 53:36.109
And they can kick you out for a year.

53:36.209 --> 53:38.611
They can't deny you a bed
if you don't fuck up.

53:38.711 --> 53:42.820
So you gotta learn to play their game.
That's why I play it cool.

53:44.616 --> 53:48.521
- I know you are not sleeping.
- What the hell is this?

53:48.621 --> 53:51.291
An Aryan nation brotherhood meeting?

53:51.391 --> 53:54.644
They don't give a shit
who they let in these days.

53:54.744 --> 53:57.030
Why don't you pull up your pants?

53:57.130 --> 53:59.550
Why don't you go to hell?

54:01.768 --> 54:04.019
- What'd he mean by that?
- I thought you were asleep.

54:04.119 --> 54:06.005
- I am asleep. I was...
- Oh, you're asleep?

54:06.105 --> 54:08.074
Why did he say that?

54:08.174 --> 54:12.083
Oh, he's a fucking racist. That's why.

54:12.778 --> 54:15.286
Stop payin' attention to him.

54:19.084 --> 54:21.887
We got white people in this system.

54:21.987 --> 54:23.990
More than you think.

54:24.090 --> 54:27.365
Yeah, not more than them, but...

54:27.826 --> 54:30.296
Yeah, there's more of us on the street.

54:30.396 --> 54:33.204
That's the pride of the white man.

54:36.935 --> 54:39.443
Shelters are like prisons.

54:39.971 --> 54:42.774
You know, just a fucking rat in a cage.

54:42.874 --> 54:45.183
This place is shit.

54:47.079 --> 54:49.687
It's designed to be shit.

54:50.115 --> 54:52.423
You read the Bible?

54:53.718 --> 54:58.557
I read the Bible. "That which is crooked
cannot be made straight."

54:58.657 --> 55:01.165
So now, here we are.

55:01.727 --> 55:04.076
Anyway, I don't care.

55:05.397 --> 55:09.643
I don't care. They don't have
any power over me. You know.

55:12.671 --> 55:15.485
I gotta go to bed.
I got work in the morning.

55:19.278 --> 55:22.119
You got a job? Work?

55:23.248 --> 55:25.554
Yeah, I got a job.

55:27.486 --> 55:28.857
Just because I sleep in this fucking bed

55:28.957 --> 55:32.458
doesn't mean I'm like some
fucking lowlife scumbag

55:32.558 --> 55:35.051
begging for change on the street.

56:15.534 --> 56:17.341
Damn.

56:54.606 --> 56:56.847
Just one moment.

57:04.983 --> 57:06.490
Okay.

57:07.319 --> 57:10.063
Now... let's see.

57:10.390 --> 57:14.093
Can you... can you tell me something?
Is there a way to get some money here?

57:14.193 --> 57:17.530
Oh, yeah. You get a job.

57:17.630 --> 57:21.168
Or get on welfare
or Social Security or disability

57:21.268 --> 57:25.306
or food stamps or...

57:26.206 --> 57:31.043
The purpose of this evaluation is to see
what kinda services you're eligible for.

57:31.143 --> 57:32.947
You know...

57:33.047 --> 57:36.297
psychiatric, substance abuse...

57:36.397 --> 57:38.733
whatever or what not.

57:39.619 --> 57:41.925
Do you understand what I'm saying?

57:46.958 --> 57:48.799
Are you alright?

57:48.899 --> 57:50.781
I'm lost.

57:50.881 --> 57:53.329
You're here because I'm gonna
evaluate you so I can help you out,

57:53.429 --> 57:56.414
so I can see what services I can get you.
How I can take care of you.

57:56.514 --> 58:00.206
I'm sorry, one second.
Let me just take care of this. Shit.

58:00.306 --> 58:01.974
Sorry.

58:02.074 --> 58:05.628
Shit. Boyfriend troubles.
You know what I'm saying?

58:05.728 --> 58:07.280
- Have a nice day...
- Have a nice day?

58:07.380 --> 58:11.489
You have a fucked up day! You ain't
got no right to talk to me this way.

58:12.017 --> 58:15.588
I live here! I live here
like everybody else does.

58:15.688 --> 58:19.092
You ain't got no right to say this thing
to me. Treat me the way you do.

58:19.192 --> 58:23.896
Act like I'm gonna rat on these boys here.
These men are my brothers.

58:23.996 --> 58:27.834
You don't know that shit?
You don't live here with us, that's why.

58:27.934 --> 58:29.769
If you know what to say,
you don't know shit.

58:29.869 --> 58:31.671
- Don't matter what you say to me.
- You don't know shit.

58:31.771 --> 58:33.993
- You gotta learn how to talk to me.
- I gotta learn how to talk...

58:34.093 --> 58:37.410
- You got to learn to act! You hear me?
- Take care, Mr. Turner.

58:37.510 --> 58:41.581
Take care? You got your nerve, man.
You got your goddamn nerve.

58:41.681 --> 58:44.384
You give me some cigarette,
you think I'm gonna rat on people.

58:44.484 --> 58:46.552
These are my people.
These are my brothers.

58:46.652 --> 58:50.556
You sit up there, try to be like
the grand master of this here place.

58:50.656 --> 58:52.908
You ain't shit, Mike.

59:06.605 --> 59:10.209
What do you want? Do you want something?

59:10.729 --> 59:12.741
You're the new guy. Dixon Turner.

59:12.841 --> 59:14.858
- Attorney at law. I want to represent you.
- I don't have anything.

59:14.958 --> 59:18.685
- I don't know what you want from me?
- I'm just kidding. I'm a jazz man.

59:18.785 --> 59:21.754
You know, I'm a musician.
I play... I play good too.

59:21.854 --> 59:25.412
- Yeah. Yeah. Where you going?
- I'm go... I'm going.

59:25.512 --> 59:28.561
Oh, I'll walk with you. Come on.
Come on, I'll walk with you.

59:28.961 --> 59:31.768
Done much walking
since you been reduced?

59:32.543 --> 59:35.359
- I'm not reduced.
- Yeah, you reduced. Refined.

59:35.459 --> 59:38.838
- Relocated. Remitted. Replaced.
- I don't know what that means. I'm not reduced.

59:38.938 --> 59:40.707
Whatever they call homeless,
that's what you are.

59:40.807 --> 59:43.847
- I'm not homeless either.
- Yeah, you're homeless.

01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:27.477
What... what number are we?

01:00:27.577 --> 01:00:29.908
What number we got?

01:00:30.008 --> 01:00:31.900
Yeah.

01:00:36.861 --> 01:00:39.632
Listen, listen, George,
you got any children?

01:00:39.864 --> 01:00:42.072
I got 2 sons...

01:00:42.433 --> 01:00:44.103
so they tell me.

01:00:44.203 --> 01:00:47.678
Army, marines. Good boys. Good boys.

01:00:47.806 --> 01:00:52.240
And I got a daughter...
though she didn't make it.

01:00:52.977 --> 01:00:56.019
Human Im... Immuno...

01:00:57.248 --> 01:00:59.284
Immuno...

01:00:59.384 --> 01:01:02.221
You know, HIV... took her.

01:01:02.321 --> 01:01:04.895
Baby didn't stand a chance.

01:01:05.089 --> 01:01:09.896
And I got another daughter.
They say between 1975 and 1976.

01:01:09.996 --> 01:01:14.033
But you know how it is being a musician
on the road makin' music.

01:01:14.133 --> 01:01:17.601
White powder. Cocaine, heroin.

01:01:17.701 --> 01:01:20.006
And a few other things too.

01:01:20.106 --> 01:01:23.793
Ended up right where you thought
you'd never be but here I am.

01:01:23.893 --> 01:01:27.146
Here I am. So, hey, hey, listen to this.

01:01:27.246 --> 01:01:32.118
Well, do you know that every...
human male...

01:01:32.218 --> 01:01:34.554
That's a man, like you and me.

01:01:34.654 --> 01:01:40.292
Makes enough sperm in 2 weeks to impregnate
every ovulating woman on this planet?

01:01:40.392 --> 01:01:44.196
That's a fact, man.
I heard it once from this doctor

01:01:44.296 --> 01:01:46.599
I was hanging out with...
on the streets.

01:01:46.699 --> 01:01:50.430
He was a meth head. You know, tweaker.

01:01:51.904 --> 01:01:54.807
He worked at Harlem
and did these tests...

01:01:54.907 --> 01:01:59.093
tuberculosis tests at the Harlem Hospital.
You know, he let them inject him...

01:02:00.779 --> 01:02:03.854
for McDonald coupons.
Can you believe that?

01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:08.591
But he... he dead now.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.723
So I don't see him anymore.

01:02:11.823 --> 01:02:15.959
He was killed by this transvestite
he was seein' on and off.

01:02:16.059 --> 01:02:19.236
More often on, if you know
what I'm talkin' about.

01:02:24.068 --> 01:02:29.130
A real doctor with a real MD
until he lost his license.

01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:32.115
He was a brain... brain man.

01:02:36.381 --> 01:02:38.618
Every 2 weeks.

01:02:38.718 --> 01:02:41.992
Every fertile female on the planet.

01:02:43.922 --> 01:02:47.159
You know, the only thing I do
for pleasure these days

01:02:47.259 --> 01:02:49.866
is have myself a Coca Cola.

01:02:50.395 --> 01:02:53.064
Coca Cola is my only...

01:02:53.164 --> 01:02:54.766
Yeah.

01:02:54.866 --> 01:02:57.073
Sometimes, Pepsi.

01:03:00.205 --> 01:03:03.175
Hey, you know what,
I played for Bill Evans once.

01:03:03.275 --> 01:03:05.978
You know who it is, don't you?
Bill Evans, jazz man.

01:03:06.078 --> 01:03:09.882
I played for him once
about 10 blocks from here.

01:03:09.982 --> 01:03:12.851
He said, I played okay.

01:03:12.951 --> 01:03:17.189
Can you believe that? That's like
Michelangelo sayin', he sayin'...

01:03:17.289 --> 01:03:20.764
he admires your paint job
on the ceilin'.

01:03:21.059 --> 01:03:24.630
I played okay. Bill Evans.

01:03:24.730 --> 01:03:26.603
Shit.

01:03:31.336 --> 01:03:33.776
Damn, we're gonna be here all day.

01:03:46.318 --> 01:03:50.026
Okay, do you have any I.D. that proves
that you're a citizen of the United States?

01:03:50.154 --> 01:03:54.726
What? No. Not on my person.
I don't have it, no. No, I'm sorry.

01:03:54.826 --> 01:03:57.801
It's okay. Look, can you get it
and come back?

01:03:58.563 --> 01:04:00.432
I don't know where it is.

01:04:00.532 --> 01:04:03.106
Alright, what's your
social security number?

01:04:04.468 --> 01:04:06.877
Okay, okay.

01:04:08.439 --> 01:04:09.642
- 930...
- No.

01:04:09.742 --> 01:04:11.777
- 05...
- Sir, that's not right.

01:04:11.877 --> 01:04:13.846
I think.

01:04:14.146 --> 01:04:16.282
- 930?
- 9... no.

01:04:16.382 --> 01:04:18.217
- 93005...
- It's not correct.

01:04:18.317 --> 01:04:20.452
The first digit can't be 9, sir.

01:04:20.552 --> 01:04:21.654
- 093?
- Oh, boy.

01:04:21.754 --> 01:04:25.491
093051120.

01:04:25.591 --> 01:04:29.566
I think. I... 093?

01:04:29.994 --> 01:04:32.765
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I can't.

01:04:32.865 --> 01:04:37.510
I can't remember. I have a hard time
with numbers. I... I have...

01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:41.173
- remembering problems
