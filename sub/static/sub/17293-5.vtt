00:02.150 --> 00:04.296
STEFAN: <i>I really hoped that
when we put Sybil down,</i>

00:04.321 --> 00:06.201
<i>it'd break whatever
control she had over him,</i>

00:06.226 --> 00:07.539
<i>but she still has ahold of him.</i>

00:07.564 --> 00:10.238
Turn off your humanity,
pledge your loyalty to me.

00:10.263 --> 00:12.530
If anyone can pull me back
from the precipice, it's you.

00:12.532 --> 00:13.543
I know you can.

00:13.568 --> 00:15.833
There are two of us and
you've met my sister,

00:15.835 --> 00:18.102
- Seline.
- Seline is the other siren?

00:18.104 --> 00:20.171
You're assuming that I'm
gonna let you remember this

00:20.173 --> 00:21.572
<i>when you wake up.</i>

00:21.574 --> 00:23.726
Your intern, Georgie,
she broke into the house.

00:23.751 --> 00:25.443
<i>I mean, she's just
a little weirdo, right?</i>

00:25.445 --> 00:26.410
- Georgie.
- I'm here.

00:26.412 --> 00:28.946
- Sorry.
- Wait!

00:28.948 --> 00:30.414
Why did you make me do that? (gasps)

00:30.416 --> 00:34.252
By the way, send Cade my regards.

00:34.254 --> 00:35.651
(tines humming)

00:35.676 --> 00:37.476
If this disrupts your psychic ability,

00:37.501 --> 00:39.350
<i>then why is Damon still your puppet?</i>

00:39.375 --> 00:41.408
I gave him a look at what awaits him,

00:41.433 --> 00:44.539
and even that was enough to make
him flip his humanity switch.

00:44.564 --> 00:46.430
Damon believes in hell.

00:46.432 --> 00:48.686
I ripped into Tyler's throat last night.

00:48.711 --> 00:50.944
Humanity or not, nobody
would forgive you for that.

(children laughing nearby)

02:52.759 --> 02:54.392
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:54.394 --> 02:56.768
What are you doing here on your day off?

02:56.793 --> 02:58.963
Caroline told me you and
your friends lost someone.

02:58.965 --> 03:00.831
- Yeah.
- I'm happy to take

03:00.833 --> 03:03.100
the girls for the day if you need me to.

03:03.102 --> 03:04.602
I mean, that...

03:04.604 --> 03:06.737
that would be a huge help, actually.

03:06.739 --> 03:07.738
Thank you.

03:07.740 --> 03:09.540
Were you close with him?

03:09.542 --> 03:11.942
(sighs) Yeah, he was one of us.

03:11.944 --> 03:14.245
He was family.

03:14.247 --> 03:15.713
I get it.

03:15.715 --> 03:17.281
I lost my family, too.

03:17.283 --> 03:18.816
Everyone?

03:18.818 --> 03:20.084
I have a sister,

03:20.086 --> 03:22.425
but we're sort of estranged.

03:22.450 --> 03:23.815
Hmm.

03:23.840 --> 03:26.324
Yeah. Tyler's parents
died a few years ago.

03:26.326 --> 03:28.626
He was the only Lockwood left.

03:28.628 --> 03:32.196
Now it's just a whole legacy...

03:32.198 --> 03:34.999
just gone.

03:35.001 --> 03:36.834
I'm sure wherever Tyler is,

03:36.836 --> 03:38.402
he's at peace.

03:38.404 --> 03:40.705
And he knows he was loved.

03:42.775 --> 03:45.109
Look, I, uh...

03:45.111 --> 03:46.377
I really need to head out.

03:46.379 --> 03:48.312
Are you sure you don't mind?

03:48.314 --> 03:50.047
Not at all. Go.

03:50.049 --> 03:51.515
I heard there's a carnival in town.

03:51.517 --> 03:52.983
Thought it might be
nice to take the twins.

03:52.985 --> 03:54.647
(chuckling): Yeah. They would love that.

03:54.672 --> 03:55.853
LIZZIE: Seline.

03:55.878 --> 03:57.560
Hey, you two.

03:57.585 --> 03:59.018
Come play with us.

04:00.526 --> 04:02.426
Hi.

04:02.428 --> 04:04.261
- Hi.
- (Seline laughing)

04:04.263 --> 04:05.296
Who can get their shoes on first?

04:05.298 --> 04:06.430
- Me.
- I can.

04:06.432 --> 04:08.733
- I can.
- (girls laughing)

04:16.385 --> 04:18.718
That's not gonna bring him back.

04:20.279 --> 04:21.781
Tyler deserved more

04:21.807 --> 04:24.048
than to be collateral
damage in whatever game

04:24.050 --> 04:26.851
Sybil's playing with Damon.

04:26.853 --> 04:29.387
Yeah. I can't even remember
our last conversation.

04:29.389 --> 04:31.889
We haven't talked in months.

04:31.891 --> 04:34.392
We've both been so busy.

04:34.394 --> 04:36.026
After everything we went through,

04:36.028 --> 04:39.864
I guess I just always assumed
that he would be there.

04:41.234 --> 04:43.667
I'm at a loss with Damon.

04:43.669 --> 04:46.937
I don't know what to do with him anymore.

04:46.939 --> 04:51.470
Maybe the best thing to
do is just to mourn Tyler

04:51.495 --> 04:52.710
with your friends.

04:52.712 --> 04:55.813
We all owe him that.

04:58.651 --> 05:00.818
(sighs)

05:07.960 --> 05:09.894
Oh, don't mind me, luv.

05:12.131 --> 05:14.799
Something wrong?

05:14.801 --> 05:16.901
I'm fine.

05:16.903 --> 05:18.135
Wow.

05:18.137 --> 05:20.771
So Damon murders Tyler Lockwood,

05:20.773 --> 05:23.040
in cold blood, and you're fine with it.

05:23.042 --> 05:25.176
I didn't mean to eavesdrop on your call,

05:25.178 --> 05:27.557
but that seems like a
decidedly not fine situation,

05:27.582 --> 05:28.712
at least to me.

05:28.714 --> 05:31.515
But that grief that you're
trying damn hard to hide

05:31.517 --> 05:35.052
is giving you this beautiful glow.

05:37.557 --> 05:39.690
Set me free, Bonnie.

05:39.692 --> 05:41.625
Set us both free.

05:41.627 --> 05:44.062
I'll take you on a proper date.

05:44.087 --> 05:45.396
Anywhere you'd like.

05:45.398 --> 05:47.031
Paris...

05:47.033 --> 05:50.134
You can fix everything
that's broken inside of me.

05:50.136 --> 05:52.736
You can fix us.

05:56.709 --> 05:59.777
Your wrists look a little raw.

06:03.082 --> 06:05.749
I'll help you out.

06:08.321 --> 06:11.255
Ah.

06:12.992 --> 06:15.759
(groans)

06:17.129 --> 06:18.629
(sighs)

06:18.631 --> 06:19.997
Bonnie Bennett,

06:19.999 --> 06:22.466
you are my saving grace.

06:28.808 --> 06:31.709
You spelled the cabin?

06:31.711 --> 06:33.410
You've been keeping a secret from me.

06:33.412 --> 06:34.845
Are you a witch again?

06:34.847 --> 06:36.447
I'm actually not.

06:36.449 --> 06:38.048
Still don't have my magic,

06:38.050 --> 06:40.084
but doesn't mean I can't
use a magical object.

06:40.086 --> 06:42.853
This is a dark object
on loan from the Armory.

06:42.855 --> 06:45.089
It's called a "flame of imprisonment."

06:45.091 --> 06:46.490
Well, aren't you fancy?

06:46.492 --> 06:48.431
It traps supernatural beings

06:48.456 --> 06:49.907
in the space where it burns.

06:49.932 --> 06:51.795
I can come and go because
I'm the one who lit it.

06:51.797 --> 06:54.331
And I'm the only one who can put it out.

06:54.333 --> 06:57.568
And I won't... unless you turn

06:57.570 --> 06:59.036
your humanity back on.

06:59.038 --> 07:01.372
Why are you suddenly taking this stand?

07:01.374 --> 07:03.574
Because Tyler Lockwood is dead.

07:03.576 --> 07:06.110
And I'm not gonna lose you, too.

07:10.216 --> 07:12.349
(footsteps approaching)

07:13.786 --> 07:15.819
What are you doing?

07:19.525 --> 07:21.158
(groans)

07:22.228 --> 07:23.661
Savasana.

07:23.663 --> 07:25.396
It's restorative.

07:25.398 --> 07:27.181
It promotes physical

07:27.206 --> 07:29.633
and emotional well-being.

07:29.635 --> 07:30.701
(fork tines humming)

07:30.703 --> 07:32.536
(groans)

07:34.640 --> 07:37.308
So not Zen.

07:37.310 --> 07:39.176
- That's for Tyler.
- To be fair,

07:39.178 --> 07:41.345
that was more Damon than it was me.

07:41.347 --> 07:43.547
I simply suggested that
he do whatever he could

07:43.549 --> 07:45.249
to sever his remaining ties.

07:45.251 --> 07:47.086
(tines humming)

07:47.111 --> 07:49.153
Georgie, where is she?

07:51.157 --> 07:53.524
I already have another cell ready.

07:53.526 --> 07:55.593
Labeled Siren Number Two.

07:57.296 --> 07:59.830
Oh, wait, that's right,
I can't see anything.

07:59.832 --> 08:02.255
My psychic abilities have
been neutralized.

08:02.280 --> 08:04.668
(tines humming)

08:04.670 --> 08:07.071
I set up an intercom system here.

08:07.073 --> 08:10.374
So this noise and pain will haunt you

08:10.376 --> 08:13.010
from now on, 24/7.

08:13.012 --> 08:16.413
Welcome to your psychic hell.

08:16.415 --> 08:19.583
(tines ringing)

08:19.585 --> 08:21.685
(switch clicks)

08:21.687 --> 08:23.053
(microphone feedback whines)

08:23.055 --> 08:24.655
- Intercom's up and running.
- Oh, good.

08:24.680 --> 08:26.457
Listen, I need you to test
the frequency levels

08:26.459 --> 08:27.758
every hour on the hour.

08:27.760 --> 08:28.750
It's incredibly important.

08:28.774 --> 08:30.101
Can I ask why?

08:30.126 --> 08:32.039
Well, because I believe
the vibrational motion

08:32.063 --> 08:34.431
had something to do with the
formation of the tunnels.

08:34.433 --> 08:35.933
That makes almost no sense.

08:35.934 --> 08:37.267
Okay, how about because I said so?

08:37.269 --> 08:40.494
Also, I got a really odd text
from Georgie last night,

08:40.519 --> 08:42.072
saying she had to leave town suddenly.

08:42.073 --> 08:43.573
She wouldn't ditch work.

08:43.576 --> 08:45.042
- Not while we're in the middle
of all this. - Agreed.

08:45.044 --> 08:46.744
Which is why I need you
to do some digging.

08:46.746 --> 08:48.579
Call her roommate, find out what's up.

08:48.604 --> 08:49.640
We need to find her right away.

08:49.642 --> 08:51.115
What about the frequency research?

08:51.117 --> 08:52.583
Multi-task.

08:52.585 --> 08:54.618
Test the frequency, look for Georgie.

08:54.620 --> 08:57.221
Call me if anything strange happens.

09:01.193 --> 09:04.428
♪ ♪

09:24.502 --> 09:26.368
DAMON: I was wondering when you guys

09:26.370 --> 09:28.470
were gonna show up.

09:28.472 --> 09:30.705
Body's probably starting
to smell a little bit.

09:30.730 --> 09:32.603
Tried to keep it as intact as I could.

09:32.628 --> 09:34.943

I got a little carried away

09:34.968 --> 09:38.145
about the whole ripping
the throat out thing.

My apologies to Donovan.

09:39.817 --> 09:42.351
I'm sure you cleaned him up real nice.

09:45.325 --> 09:46.989
What are you gonna do with that?

STEFAN: Is that why
you came home, Damon?

10:18.175 --> 10:19.474

10:19.476 --> 10:20.508
Not empty, brother.

10:20.510 --> 10:22.177
(grunts)

10:22.179 --> 10:24.078
Don't move or I'll snap his neck.

Give Matt here a
non-transferrable invitation

10:26.483 --> 10:28.383

Damon, enough.

10:32.923 --> 10:35.690
innocent people did you kill on
your no humanity bender, hmm?

10:35.692 --> 10:38.126
Doesn't matter what you say or don't.

10:38.128 --> 10:40.028
The devil knows what you did.

10:40.030 --> 10:41.830
What's happened to you?

10:42.999 --> 10:45.066
What's so surprising about this?

10:45.068 --> 10:46.601
I'm who I've always been.

I killed Tyler, you hate my guts,

11:11.161 --> 11:13.647
our ties are severed, huh? Great.

11:13.649 --> 11:15.779
If you thought there was
any remaining opportunity

11:15.804 --> 11:20.301
to rescue me, let this prove you wrong.

11:25.375 --> 11:27.141
CAROLINE: <i>It was awful.</i>

11:27.143 --> 11:29.344
Like Damon's desperate
for us all to hate him.

11:29.346 --> 11:30.845
Sorry I wasn't there.

Please tell me it's going
better than it did yesterday.

11:35.367 --> 11:37.719
It's worse, if that's even possible.

11:37.721 --> 11:40.321
Drying him out didn't work.
Starving him didn't work.

11:40.323 --> 11:43.273
I played the guitar.
I told him our history.

11:43.298 --> 11:44.993
It's like talking to a brick wall.

11:44.995 --> 11:47.328
What did it for you, when you
had your humanity off?

11:47.330 --> 11:49.097
What made you break free?

11:49.099 --> 11:53.134
(sighs) I had to face my biggest fear.

11:53.136 --> 11:55.470
That I wasn't worth loving anymore.

11:55.472 --> 11:59.474
And that my mom would be ashamed of me.

11:59.476 --> 12:02.477
I had to be reminded how
much she loved me,

12:02.479 --> 12:07.415
and then I had to
want to live up to that.

12:08.285 --> 12:09.918
Is that helpful?

12:09.920 --> 12:12.086
Yeah.

12:12.088 --> 12:13.555
It is.

12:13.557 --> 12:15.356
Keep me posted.

12:15.358 --> 12:16.865
And don't worry about not being here.

12:16.890 --> 12:19.294
We'll give Tyler a proper
good-bye when this is all over.

12:19.296 --> 12:21.896
- Yeah, when will that be?
- Soon.

12:21.898 --> 12:23.131
I hope.

12:23.133 --> 12:25.233
I hope so, too.

12:25.235 --> 12:26.701
(phone beeps)

12:26.703 --> 12:28.469
(sighs)

12:28.471 --> 12:30.371
ENZO: Dead friend problems?

12:30.373 --> 12:33.374
My heart bleeds for you.

12:33.376 --> 12:35.510
All this trauma.

12:35.512 --> 12:37.845
The burden of always
having to protect everyone.

12:37.847 --> 12:40.148
Why don't you just take me
off your plate, hmm?

12:40.150 --> 12:43.585
Why don't you just turn
your humanity back on?

12:43.587 --> 12:47.322
(sighs) Can't we both agree that
my humanity was a hindrance?

12:47.324 --> 12:49.624
I was angry, depressed.

12:49.626 --> 12:51.926
A-A tragic poet full of darkness.

12:51.928 --> 12:53.895
(sighs)

12:53.897 --> 12:55.797
Where's the fun in reverting back

12:55.799 --> 12:58.866
to an inferior version of myself?

13:00.136 --> 13:03.371
You were a lot of amazing things, too.

13:03.373 --> 13:05.974
You were loyal, creative,

13:05.976 --> 13:08.710
and wildly romantic.

13:08.712 --> 13:10.712
Mmm.

13:10.714 --> 13:13.514
Well, you know, even if I did turn it on,

13:13.516 --> 13:14.849
it's too late for you.

13:14.851 --> 13:17.185
You missed Tyler's funeral.

13:17.187 --> 13:18.987
Abandoning your friends
in their time of need.

13:18.989 --> 13:21.322
That, my dear, is cold.

13:23.693 --> 13:25.426
I'll be back.

13:28.331 --> 13:31.065
I'll still be here.

13:31.067 --> 13:33.601
Thanks to you.

13:36.606 --> 13:39.240
Remember, it's not Damon.

13:39.242 --> 13:41.576
This is Damon under the
control of a she-devil.

13:41.578 --> 13:43.945
And we have to find a way to
break her control. And we will.

13:43.947 --> 13:45.348
I've got my interns working on it.

13:45.373 --> 13:47.882
And, in the meantime,
what, let him run wild

13:47.884 --> 13:49.550
and kill another one of our friends?

13:49.552 --> 13:50.885
I am trying to prevent that, you know.

13:50.887 --> 13:53.154
Look, even if we break Sybil's hold,

13:53.156 --> 13:55.623
once Damon realizes what he's done,

13:55.625 --> 13:58.993
what Elena will think of him,
he may not recover.

13:58.995 --> 14:01.162
What are you suggesting?

14:01.164 --> 14:04.899
While we figure out how to
save Damon from the sirens,

14:04.901 --> 14:06.234
we have to figure out

14:06.236 --> 14:08.036
how to save him from himself.

14:08.038 --> 14:10.638
We have to put him down.

14:11.374 --> 14:13.041
For how long?

14:13.043 --> 14:14.842
As long as we need to.

14:14.844 --> 14:16.144
You sure?

14:17.414 --> 14:19.013
It's for his own good.

14:19.015 --> 14:22.350
And it's the only way that
we can protect ourselves.

14:29.125 --> 14:31.101
Well, this is a surprise.

14:31.126 --> 14:32.570
To be clear, we're not friends,

14:32.595 --> 14:34.362
and I'm not here to set you free.

14:34.364 --> 14:36.964
In fact, I never want to see you again.

14:36.966 --> 14:40.535
- Why are you here then?
- Because I want answers.

14:40.537 --> 14:43.337
I stole that hunk of junk
from Donovan's mystery dad.

14:43.339 --> 14:44.839
Burned all my bridges.

14:44.841 --> 14:46.974
Made everybody hate me. I'm guessing

14:46.976 --> 14:49.177
it's because you're still in my head.

14:49.179 --> 14:50.445
And what makes you think that?

14:50.447 --> 14:51.913
Because none of it's for me.

14:51.915 --> 14:54.282
I can't quite understand
why I have free will

14:54.284 --> 14:55.516
and yet I'm still

14:55.518 --> 14:57.552
your errand boy. I do things

14:57.554 --> 15:01.055
to make you happy, and I don't know why.

15:01.057 --> 15:03.458
Sounds like you have regrets.

15:03.460 --> 15:06.427
Regret implies that you're
not a loyal servant.

15:06.429 --> 15:08.996
What are you talking about?
I killed Tyler Lockwood.

15:08.998 --> 15:11.899
- Of course I'm loyal.
- No, you're upset

15:11.901 --> 15:13.412
because you upset your friends.

15:13.437 --> 15:15.536
My friends don't care about me anymore.

15:15.538 --> 15:17.405
But you killed someone
that they do care about.

15:17.407 --> 15:19.173
That must've made them feel something.

15:19.175 --> 15:21.642
Sure looks like it made
you feel something.

15:21.644 --> 15:23.845
Here you are, troubled, hostile.

15:23.847 --> 15:25.446
You know what that tells me?

15:25.448 --> 15:26.981
That you're not completely mine.

15:26.983 --> 15:28.683
That the cold, dark heart

15:28.685 --> 15:32.086
of Damon Salvatore felt a flash of pain

15:32.088 --> 15:34.622
when he took Tyler Lockwood's life away.

15:34.624 --> 15:36.290
It made you feel,

15:36.292 --> 15:38.126
and it felt bad.

15:38.151 --> 15:39.942
I don't feel anything anymore.

15:39.944 --> 15:40.995
Wrong.

15:40.997 --> 15:42.797
It's written all over your face.

15:42.799 --> 15:45.767
Your humanity is riding
that dimmer switch,

15:45.769 --> 15:47.902
and right now it is pushing itself up.

15:47.904 --> 15:49.670
And it feels terrible, doesn't it?

15:49.672 --> 15:51.038
- Shut up.
- Dimmer goes up,

15:51.040 --> 15:52.406
and you'll get your feelings back.

15:52.408 --> 15:54.509
Maybe your brother will love you again.

15:54.511 --> 15:57.044
But, boy, will it feel awful.

15:57.046 --> 15:59.781
And Elena's reaction to
everything you've done,

15:59.783 --> 16:01.382
let's not even think about that.

16:01.384 --> 16:03.651
Stop talking.

16:03.653 --> 16:06.463
Dimmer that switch back down,

16:06.488 --> 16:08.790
and all these bad feelings
and all this confusion,

16:08.792 --> 16:10.858
it'll all disappear.

16:10.860 --> 16:14.061
Me? I prefer Option B.

16:14.063 --> 16:17.465
- The dimmer down. Total abandonment.
- (groans)

16:18.268 --> 16:19.433
I said shut up.

16:19.435 --> 16:22.403
Shut up!

16:22.405 --> 16:25.573
What do you want from me?

16:25.575 --> 16:27.842
I want you, Damon.

16:27.844 --> 16:29.744
All of you.

16:29.746 --> 16:32.280
I can rewrite your subconscious,
but that will only get me

16:32.282 --> 16:33.781
so far.

16:33.783 --> 16:35.116
I'm not going to have you

16:35.118 --> 16:36.417
the way that I want you

16:36.419 --> 16:37.718
while you still have

16:37.720 --> 16:40.421
these emotional ties to your past.

16:47.463 --> 16:50.464
Go see your brother.

16:50.466 --> 16:54.435
Let him guide that dimmer switch
up until you feel everything.

16:54.437 --> 16:57.672
If that's how you want to live
your life, go ahead... live it.

16:57.674 --> 17:02.118
Maybe you'll find some
small pockets of happiness

17:02.143 --> 17:05.055
before death delivers you to Cade.

17:27.211 --> 17:30.379
Hey, uh, somebody just
dropped this off for you.

17:30.381 --> 17:32.147
Said he was from the Armory?

17:32.149 --> 17:34.269
Yeah. Just, uh, put it down.
I'll go through it later.

17:38.055 --> 17:41.890
Box everything up. Room by room.

17:43.153 --> 17:46.528
Uh, Matt, you know, we
can do this tomorrow.

17:46.530 --> 17:48.230
Or the day after, if you need time.

17:48.232 --> 17:49.731
No, it's fine.

17:49.733 --> 17:53.035
I'm an expert at dealing
with loss, you know?

17:53.037 --> 17:55.003
Started at a young age.

17:55.005 --> 17:56.438
(sighs)

17:56.440 --> 17:59.508
Yeah, I guess I deserve that.

18:00.878 --> 18:04.413
You do and you don't.

18:04.415 --> 18:06.982
I'm sorry. It's just...

18:06.984 --> 18:09.618
Tyler and this place

18:09.620 --> 18:13.922
and the fact that I have
vampire blood in my system.

18:13.924 --> 18:17.526
And if I die in the next 24 hours,
I'm gonna become one.

18:18.395 --> 18:20.596
How did it come to this?

18:20.598 --> 18:21.830
How did all this happen?

18:21.832 --> 18:23.532
"All this"?

18:24.869 --> 18:27.603
What do you mean? Like vampires

18:27.605 --> 18:29.738
and vervain and...

18:29.740 --> 18:30.739
(shuddering breath)

18:30.741 --> 18:33.175
...and death?

18:33.177 --> 18:35.177
This was my life.

18:35.179 --> 18:36.578
This is what I dealt with.

18:36.580 --> 18:39.615
Alone. For a long time.

18:39.617 --> 18:42.551
This is what I wanted to escape.

18:42.553 --> 18:45.287
So, forgive me

18:45.289 --> 18:48.357
if I'm not in the mood to
give you a history lesson.

18:58.636 --> 19:01.303
(sighs)

19:12.683 --> 19:14.616
TYLER: <i>Matt, if you got this,</i>

19:14.618 --> 19:17.853
<i>it means I'm dead, which sucks.</i>

19:17.855 --> 19:22.591
<i>It also means I need your
help finding someone.</i>

19:34.772 --> 19:36.939
Thought you were gone for the day.

19:36.941 --> 19:38.473
Hey, take a look at this, will you?

19:38.475 --> 19:40.542
Yeah.

19:40.544 --> 19:42.978
So, the distance between
Mystic Falls and the Armory

19:42.980 --> 19:44.938
is roughly 35 miles.

19:44.963 --> 19:46.415
Winding roads, hill country.

19:46.417 --> 19:47.749
But I was able to walk the distance

19:47.751 --> 19:49.284
of that tunnel in just a few hours.

19:49.286 --> 19:52.521
Which would make it, what, seven miles?

19:52.523 --> 19:54.456
The tunnel must cut directly
under the mountains.

19:54.458 --> 19:56.959
Right. But the walls are old.

19:56.961 --> 19:58.226
Centuries, at least.

19:58.228 --> 19:59.728
So who the hell built them?

19:59.730 --> 20:00.829
And why?

20:00.831 --> 20:01.997
Hmm.

20:01.999 --> 20:03.565
You want me to get into it?

20:03.567 --> 20:06.468
No. No, I'll figure it out.

20:06.470 --> 20:09.504
- So what's the latest on Georgie?
- I called her roommate.

20:09.506 --> 20:11.473
She said all of Georgie's
stuff is still in her room.

20:11.475 --> 20:13.075
If she left, she didn't
take anything with her.

20:13.077 --> 20:14.476
Okay, I need you to call the police

20:14.478 --> 20:15.777
and file a missing persons report.

20:15.779 --> 20:16.912
Seriously?

20:16.914 --> 20:18.146
It's just a precaution.

20:18.148 --> 20:19.815
How's the frequency research coming?

20:19.817 --> 20:21.850
You keep acting like I'm
doing something scientific.

20:21.852 --> 20:23.482
I'm literally banging a fork.

20:23.507 --> 20:25.320
It's ridiculous, and I've
learned nothing.

20:25.322 --> 20:27.856
You ever gonna tell me
what this is all about?

20:28.726 --> 20:31.259
One day.

20:33.230 --> 20:34.863
(carnival music playing)

20:34.865 --> 20:36.465
(indistinct chatter, laughter)

20:40.004 --> 20:41.470
(clinking)

20:41.472 --> 20:43.638
Good try.

20:43.640 --> 20:45.774
(chuckling): Almost.

20:45.776 --> 20:47.743
This is too hard.

20:47.745 --> 20:49.077
Oh.

20:49.079 --> 20:52.681
(humming softly)

20:54.785 --> 20:56.284
Why don't you give the girls

20:56.286 --> 20:58.954
- a goldfish for their efforts?
- (gasps, squeals)

20:58.956 --> 21:02.391
We'll take that one.

21:03.694 --> 21:06.695
Is he sick?

21:06.697 --> 21:08.597
Aw, I think he might be dead.

21:08.599 --> 21:10.399
But that's okay. Tell you what,

21:10.401 --> 21:12.834
we'll take him home and
give him a proper burial.

21:12.836 --> 21:14.736
- Okay.
- Okay?

21:17.975 --> 21:20.008
(footsteps approaching)

21:20.010 --> 21:21.910
CAROLINE: I swear,

21:21.912 --> 21:24.713
if Seline wasn't so good with
the girls, I would hate her.

21:24.715 --> 21:27.516
She's too perfect to be a real person.

21:27.518 --> 21:29.184
- Who's that for?
- Got a text from Damon

21:29.186 --> 21:30.144
a little while ago.

21:30.169 --> 21:31.887
He wants to meet up at the carnival.

21:31.889 --> 21:33.855
- Why the carnival?
- I don't know.

21:33.880 --> 21:35.816
But this is my only chance,
I don't know if I'll get another

21:35.840 --> 21:36.625
so I have to take it.

21:36.627 --> 21:38.191
- Are you gonna need some help?
- No.

21:38.216 --> 21:40.362
I'm not putting you in any
more danger, Caroline.

21:40.364 --> 21:43.365
Two vampires are better
than one, it's basic math.

21:43.367 --> 21:46.334
I have to do this on my own.

21:47.438 --> 21:49.604
It's the right thing.

21:49.606 --> 21:51.740
Okay? You know it is.

21:53.043 --> 21:56.878
He might not forgive me after this.

21:58.246 --> 22:01.950
And I might lose him forever.

22:01.952 --> 22:04.386
You already lost him.

22:11.462 --> 22:13.662
(jazz music plays)

22:19.071 --> 22:21.303
Happy New Year's, luv.

22:21.305 --> 22:22.938
Come on, dance with me.

22:22.940 --> 22:24.239
Hmm? Like we used to.

22:24.241 --> 22:26.341
Oh, I remember now, all the lights,

22:26.343 --> 22:28.076
the music, mmm.

22:28.078 --> 22:29.778
Screw you.

22:30.423 --> 22:32.557
You didn't buy it? Not just a little?

22:32.582 --> 22:34.449
I'm glad you found a new
way to amuse yourself.

22:35.586 --> 22:39.154

22:39.156 --> 22:40.451

22:40.476 --> 22:42.791
unbelievably saccharine.

22:42.793 --> 22:44.757
And for what? I kept you safe

22:44.782 --> 22:47.449
for three years and then
you tried to kill me.

22:48.398 --> 22:50.565
It looks like

22:50.567 --> 22:52.400
you might be trying that again?

22:52.402 --> 22:54.269
I'm gonna get through to you.

22:54.271 --> 22:56.004
I'm gonna use your darkest fears

22:56.006 --> 22:57.672
to pull you out of this.

22:57.674 --> 23:00.108
Okay, well, I'm a complicated person.

23:00.110 --> 23:02.177
In my 140 years on this Earth,

23:02.179 --> 23:04.012
- no one's figured me out.
- Oh, well.

23:04.014 --> 23:05.580

23:12.380 --> 23:15.223

23:15.225 --> 23:17.259

23:20.631 --> 23:22.898

23:24.168 --> 23:26.735

23:26.737 --> 23:29.771
The one thing that happens
to you again and again.

23:29.773 --> 23:33.708
- Everyone leaves, no one stays.
- Hmm.

23:33.710 --> 23:35.810
Well, that ends now.

23:35.812 --> 23:38.680

23:38.682 --> 23:40.015

23:42.586 --> 23:46.721
Well, desperate times call
for desperate measures.

23:46.723 --> 23:49.691

turn your humanity back on.

24:32.436 --> 24:34.569

24:34.571 --> 24:36.671
I need your help.

24:43.670 --> 24:45.903
I got to say, I'm surprised.

24:45.905 --> 24:46.873
Last time I saw you,

24:46.898 --> 24:48.906
you seemed pretty
hell-bent on severing ties.

24:48.931 --> 24:51.528
Yeah, in hindsight, that might
have been a bit dramatic.

24:51.530 --> 24:53.444
Well, it's a little late to take it back.

24:53.446 --> 24:54.779
Even if Sybil made you do it.

24:54.804 --> 24:57.381
Yeah, see, this is where it gets tricky.

24:57.383 --> 24:59.717
I want to serve her,
Stefan, I mean, I have to.

24:59.719 --> 25:01.112
And serving her keeps me away

25:01.137 --> 25:02.753
from the big bad devil himself.

25:02.755 --> 25:03.988
And I want to stay away from hell

25:03.990 --> 25:05.556
as long as humanly possible.

25:05.558 --> 25:07.899
- By turning off your humanity?
- There are worse fates.

25:07.924 --> 25:08.859
You know I can help you.

25:08.861 --> 25:11.128
If you let me.

25:12.465 --> 25:14.899
You're gonna make me turn it back on.

25:14.901 --> 25:16.088
No.

25:16.113 --> 25:18.414
No, I-I-I-I-I don't want
to do that, Stefan.

25:18.439 --> 25:19.437
You have to.

25:19.439 --> 25:21.105
You can't keep doing what you're doing.

25:21.107 --> 25:23.174
Why not? Isn't this easier?

25:23.176 --> 25:25.176
There are no amends to be made, Stefan.

25:25.178 --> 25:27.442
I can't munch on bunnies and save people,

25:27.467 --> 25:29.146
and work my way back to peace.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.962
I'm hell-bound.

25:31.964 --> 25:33.597
So, why? Tell me.

25:33.599 --> 25:36.467
Knowing what I know, why would
I ever want to feel again?

25:36.469 --> 25:38.235
Because if we can't feel,

25:38.237 --> 25:40.771
then what's the point
of being alive, huh?

25:43.423 --> 25:45.223
Exactly, brother.

25:48.514 --> 25:50.714
- What's the point?
- No.

25:50.716 --> 25:52.316
I'm not buying it.

25:52.318 --> 25:55.252
I can see your humanity trying
to break through, Damon.

25:55.254 --> 25:56.520
Come home with me.

25:56.522 --> 25:58.522
I can help you be happy again.

25:58.524 --> 25:59.756
How?

25:59.758 --> 26:02.025
It'll take time and work.

26:02.027 --> 26:04.294
But I'll be there for you.

26:05.865 --> 26:08.966
I-I... I can't, Stefan.

26:08.968 --> 26:11.001
- I ruined everything.
- Hey.

26:11.003 --> 26:13.270

26:13.272 --> 26:15.706

26:15.708 --> 26:18.709

27:03.556 --> 27:05.055
I really hope you leave at some point.

27:05.057 --> 27:06.690

28:46.725 --> 28:48.892
Yes, but in our own way.

28:48.894 --> 28:52.663
You see, we are made up of two parts.

28:52.665 --> 28:55.666
Our body and our soul.

28:55.668 --> 29:00.214
See, some people are very special.

29:00.239 --> 29:01.905
And when they die,

29:01.907 --> 29:04.474
a man named Cade

29:04.476 --> 29:06.476
comes to take their soul away.

29:06.478 --> 29:08.945
- Does he take the body, too?
- No.

29:08.947 --> 29:11.948
But that doesn't mean the
bodies aren't special, too.

29:11.950 --> 29:14.184
They need to be treated with dignity

29:14.186 --> 29:16.953

29:16.955 --> 29:19.222
And Cade respects that.

you're strong enough.
