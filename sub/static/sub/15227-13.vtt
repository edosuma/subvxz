01:15.808 --> 01:19.177
I don't even know why I
         bother opening my mail.

01:19.211 --> 01:21.679
It's always
                 the same thing.

01:21.713 --> 01:23.381
Yeah, I know.
          Bills, huh?

01:23.415 --> 01:25.516
Checks.
                         Yeah...

01:25.551 --> 01:29.287
Some days you just want to dump
       the whole thing...

01:29.321 --> 01:30.655
Checks?

01:31.757 --> 01:35.393
Ever since my dad died

01:35.428 --> 01:40.531
and my brother took charge
         of my estate,

01:40.566 --> 01:43.834
I've been getting checks,
        lots of checks.

01:43.869 --> 01:45.636
I suppose this is
               a silly question.

01:45.670 --> 01:48.239
In fact, uh, knowing you,
       I think it might turn out

01:48.273 --> 01:49.874
to be a silly question,
                     but anyway,

01:49.908 --> 01:51.476
uh, why don't you
                     cash those?

01:51.510 --> 01:53.377
Alex, Alex, Alex...

01:53.412 --> 01:54.979
Yeah, I knew it was
              absurd. I knew it.

01:56.682 --> 01:59.951
When you cash them,
what have you got?

02:01.454 --> 02:05.290
Money.

02:05.324 --> 02:10.026
Money can be lost,
stolen or wasted

02:10.062 --> 02:11.996
and you feel terrible.

02:12.030 --> 02:14.332
This way, if anything
happens to them,

02:14.366 --> 02:16.501
what have I lost?

02:16.535 --> 02:19.237
Checks.

02:20.773 --> 02:21.906
Iggy?
Yo.

02:21.941 --> 02:23.107
Iggy, come over here,

02:23.142 --> 02:24.475
come over here.

02:24.509 --> 02:26.178
You know what you need?

02:26.212 --> 02:29.347
You need somebody
     to handle your money.

02:29.381 --> 02:31.849
Now let me be
  your business manager, Iggy.

02:31.883 --> 02:34.585
Oh, uh...

02:36.054 --> 02:38.489
I don't know, boss.

02:38.524 --> 02:40.959
I've heard about
       business managers

02:40.993 --> 02:45.329
running off to Mexico
   with their clients' money.

02:45.364 --> 02:48.799
And if you did that,
    I'd miss you like crazy.

02:50.635 --> 02:52.837
Jim, Jim, Jim, come here.
                           Yeah.

02:52.871 --> 02:56.074
I think we better go open up a
bank account for you right now.

02:56.108 --> 02:57.241
Come on.

02:57.276 --> 02:58.409
Okeydoke.

02:58.443 --> 03:00.177
You got any
identification on you?

03:00.212 --> 03:02.780
Sure.

03:02.815 --> 03:04.382
"Jim Ignatowski."

03:04.416 --> 03:05.617
Yeah.

03:05.651 --> 03:08.453
You'll-you'll need
your driver's license.

03:08.487 --> 03:11.923
Oh, you need two IDs?

03:11.957 --> 03:13.257
Yeah.
                         Got it!

03:16.262 --> 03:18.096
Louie!

03:19.498 --> 03:20.631
What do you want?

03:20.665 --> 03:22.733
I want to say something to you,

03:22.768 --> 03:27.238
you miserable,
      selfish, nasty man!

03:27.273 --> 03:28.439
Maybe you noticed

03:28.473 --> 03:30.074
that we have not had you
over to dinner

03:30.108 --> 03:32.944
to our house
in over a month now.

03:32.979 --> 03:34.813
Last night
Tony had us to dinner.

03:34.847 --> 03:37.581
Now, everybody
we have had to dinner

03:37.616 --> 03:39.784
has paid us back
except you.

03:39.818 --> 03:43.154
In my country,
that is a terrible insult!

03:43.188 --> 03:44.789
And I am tired
of waiting!

03:44.823 --> 03:47.625
You are no longer welcome
in my home!

03:47.660 --> 03:51.196
And I just want to tell you
that to your face!

03:51.230 --> 03:55.933
You're never gonna taste
 my jellied weasel feet again!

03:58.971 --> 04:01.305
I'm going to be
       a little bit late.

04:01.339 --> 04:04.809
I love to touch her all over
     when she's like this.

04:11.049 --> 04:13.518
Louie, you seem upset.

04:13.552 --> 04:15.553
So?

04:15.588 --> 04:17.322
No, I mean
                genuinely upset.

04:17.356 --> 04:20.858
Yeah, Nardo, I'm upset.

04:20.892 --> 04:24.195
The wife of the guy I like most
         in this garage

04:24.229 --> 04:26.998
just said I'm not welcome
     in their home anymore.

04:27.032 --> 04:28.867
You see,

04:28.901 --> 04:31.302
I used to look forward
       to those evenings.

04:31.336 --> 04:33.204
So why don't you just invite
      them over for dinner

04:33.238 --> 04:34.372
at your apartment?

04:34.406 --> 04:35.373
No, no, no, no.

04:35.407 --> 04:37.208
You haven't seen
where I live now.

04:37.242 --> 04:39.811
I don't invite <i>any</i> guests
          over there.

04:40.912 --> 04:43.982
It's cheap, but
                   it's a sewer.

04:44.016 --> 04:46.150
I don't-I don't know
          why I stay.

04:46.184 --> 04:48.085
Because it's you?

04:50.055 --> 04:51.923
I'm sorry.

04:51.957 --> 04:54.125
So, Louie, you know,
you can afford a better place.

04:54.159 --> 04:56.594
Why don't you get yourself
a nice apartment?

04:56.629 --> 04:59.230
You know, it could be
     a first step for you.

04:59.264 --> 05:01.065
Eh...

05:01.099 --> 05:03.134
If you could improve your style
           of living,

05:03.168 --> 05:05.503
next thing you know, you could
    improve your whole life.

05:07.139 --> 05:09.741
I love the way you're talking
         to me, Nardo.

05:09.775 --> 05:12.443
Nobody ever talks to me nicely,

05:12.477 --> 05:15.280
and what you're saying
          makes sense.

05:15.314 --> 05:19.416
I've always wanted
   a really great apartment.

05:19.451 --> 05:22.220
And, you know, something plush

05:22.254 --> 05:25.723
with the-with the pipes
       inside the walls.

05:25.758 --> 05:27.725
You know,

05:27.759 --> 05:31.562
this could be the birth of a
       whole new Louie De Palma.

05:31.597 --> 05:32.963
Yeah.

05:32.998 --> 05:34.264
Thanks, Nardo.

05:34.299 --> 05:35.800
Sure.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.669
(gasps)

05:37.703 --> 05:38.770
(stammers)
                          Louie!

05:38.804 --> 05:40.071
Ignore it!
Ignore it!

05:40.105 --> 05:41.205
Ignore it!

05:41.240 --> 05:43.741
That was the old Louie
        saying good-bye.

06:02.694 --> 06:04.161
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho.

06:04.195 --> 06:07.198
Oh, ho-ho.

06:07.232 --> 06:10.368
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

06:10.402 --> 06:11.836
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho.

06:11.870 --> 06:14.973
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho.

06:15.007 --> 06:18.842
Mr. De Palma, is, uh, is this
     what you had in mind?

06:18.877 --> 06:20.345
How can I have this in mind?

06:20.379 --> 06:22.447
I've never seen anything
     like this in my life!

06:22.481 --> 06:25.283
This is-this is-this is great!

06:25.317 --> 06:27.385
Look at this fireplace.

06:27.419 --> 06:30.321
Look at that.

06:30.355 --> 06:32.389
And the rug.

06:32.424 --> 06:34.225
Ooh, ooh.

06:34.259 --> 06:36.260
Ooh...

06:42.535 --> 06:44.101
Ooh!
(laughs)

06:44.136 --> 06:45.870
This is...

06:45.904 --> 06:47.104
Whoo-hoo!

06:47.138 --> 06:49.474
And an ice maker!

06:49.508 --> 06:52.676
An ice... I always wanted
         an ice maker.

06:52.711 --> 06:55.413
Look, look, look, it makes
     those little ice cubes

06:55.447 --> 06:57.382
with the hole in it.

06:57.416 --> 06:59.050
Whoo!

06:59.084 --> 07:01.452
Microwave?

07:01.487 --> 07:02.787
You know,

07:02.821 --> 07:05.523
I read somewhere where this guy
           in Jersey

07:05.557 --> 07:09.259
claims that he got sterilized
        by one of these,

07:09.294 --> 07:11.495
but-but I figure
   he must have been cooking

07:11.530 --> 07:13.564
in some weird position.

07:23.442 --> 07:25.143
Oh, this is...

07:25.177 --> 07:27.245
A balcony!

07:27.279 --> 07:28.579
Oh...

07:28.614 --> 07:31.549
Whoo-whoo!

07:32.785 --> 07:34.352
(spits)

07:40.392 --> 07:43.327
This is...
                   This place...

07:43.362 --> 07:45.129
I mean, this is...

07:45.163 --> 07:48.098
(doorbell chiming)

07:52.971 --> 07:55.506
Was that the doorbell?

07:55.540 --> 07:57.008
Mr. De Palma, I'm awfully sorry.

07:57.042 --> 07:59.576
I normally wouldn't dream of
scheduling two clients at once,

07:59.611 --> 08:02.280
but, you see, this was the only
    time they could make it.

08:02.314 --> 08:03.514
Hello.
      MAN:
       Hi.

08:03.548 --> 08:04.682
Please,
won't you come in?

08:04.717 --> 08:07.051
Now, uh, Mr. De Palma,

08:07.085 --> 08:09.453
this is Mr.
and Mrs. Sheffield.

08:09.488 --> 08:12.156
They both just
           graduated law school.

08:12.191 --> 08:13.958
Now what do you
                  think of that?

08:13.993 --> 08:17.562
Well, give me a minute to rub
     down the goose bumps.

08:17.596 --> 08:22.199
We wanted a place like
             this all our lives.

08:22.234 --> 08:23.734
That long, huh?

08:23.768 --> 08:26.204
Oh, it's just perfect for now.

08:26.238 --> 08:28.606
Oh, Scott doesn't want to
       have children right away.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.842
Go stand by the microwave.

08:34.779 --> 08:37.414
Mrs. Bascome,

08:37.448 --> 08:39.183
I'm prepared
       to talk financing.

08:39.217 --> 08:42.553
Well, now this is what
we call a 50% building.

08:42.587 --> 08:43.888
Mm-hmm.

08:43.923 --> 08:45.956
Half the purchase price
must be paid

08:45.990 --> 08:48.292
in cash,
no financing.

08:48.327 --> 08:51.296
Now in this case,
that comes to $95,000.

08:51.330 --> 08:53.898
(raspy gasp)

08:53.932 --> 08:56.701
Geesh!

08:56.735 --> 08:59.436
I'm afraid that's just a little
    too rich for our blood.

08:59.471 --> 09:00.471
Whoo!

09:00.505 --> 09:03.240
(stammers):
          Oh, me, too!

09:03.275 --> 09:04.275
Ugh!

09:04.310 --> 09:05.343
Ooh!

09:05.377 --> 09:07.812
Aw!

09:07.846 --> 09:09.013
Ah-ha!

09:09.047 --> 09:10.347
Hah!

09:10.382 --> 09:12.349
Hah! Whoo!

09:12.384 --> 09:14.585
Ha!

09:14.619 --> 09:15.786
Oh-ho!

09:15.820 --> 09:18.623
$95,000...

09:18.657 --> 09:20.591
I'll take it!

09:22.928 --> 09:27.498
All right, Mrs. Bascome,
   you wait right over here.

09:27.532 --> 09:31.269
Okay, who wants
    a really good cab today?

09:31.303 --> 09:32.469
Oh, I do, boss.

09:32.504 --> 09:34.438
Oh, good.

09:34.472 --> 09:36.240
I'm glad you do, Iggy.

09:36.274 --> 09:37.709
You know the rules now.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.243
Oh, okeydoke.

09:39.278 --> 09:41.445
How much do you want?

09:41.479 --> 09:44.415
$48,000.

09:46.184 --> 09:49.653
Okay, but if I'm gonna pay
that kind of money,

09:49.688 --> 09:51.822
I want a cab
with a heater.

09:51.857 --> 09:53.190
Hey, wait a minute.

09:53.224 --> 09:54.658
Louie, what're you trying
          to do here?
                        Louie...

09:54.693 --> 09:56.194
Don't-don't
                 listen to them.

09:56.228 --> 09:57.428
Don't listen to them.

09:57.462 --> 10:01.933
Now, Iggy, I found
               a co-op apartment

10:01.967 --> 10:04.034
that I can buy into...
    Uh-huh.

10:04.068 --> 10:07.004
that is the apartment
                   of my dreams.

10:07.039 --> 10:08.973
Now, I got most
                   of the money,

10:09.008 --> 10:13.210
but I need $48,000 more
           for the down payment.

10:13.244 --> 10:14.212
Uh-huh.

10:14.246 --> 10:15.646
Hey, now wait
                a minute, Louie.

10:15.680 --> 10:17.181
I'm not gonna let you take
  advantage of him like that.

10:17.215 --> 10:19.216
Uh, let the man speak.

10:24.723 --> 10:27.358
Jim, you're the only
              one I can turn to.

10:27.392 --> 10:29.627
That's incredible.

10:29.661 --> 10:30.995
I know, I know.

10:31.029 --> 10:32.696
It's a lot of money,
                 I know, I know.

10:32.731 --> 10:34.565
You called me "Jim."

10:34.600 --> 10:38.169
This marks a turning point
in our relationship.

10:38.203 --> 10:40.204
I want to remember
this day.

10:40.239 --> 10:41.572
The red-letter day

10:41.606 --> 10:44.075
when my boss and buddy
finally called...

10:44.109 --> 10:47.278
I called you Jim.
                       Jim. Jim.

10:47.312 --> 10:50.181
I know they say...

10:50.215 --> 10:52.015
that money can't buy love.

10:52.050 --> 10:53.384
Uh-huh.

10:53.418 --> 10:56.353
But if you give me
          these for 48 big ones,

10:56.388 --> 10:59.690
it'll be Valentine's
                    Day forever.

11:02.294 --> 11:05.062
You got it--
48 thou.

11:05.096 --> 11:06.698
ALEX:
           Wait a minute, Louie.

11:06.732 --> 11:09.199
What are you trying to do here?
         Hey, Louie, what're you
            trying to pull here?

11:09.234 --> 11:11.301
I am gonna pay him back.

11:11.336 --> 11:13.337
And this is all
                 gonna be legal.

11:13.371 --> 11:15.773
I'm gonna sign a
                promissory note.

11:15.808 --> 11:18.843
And I am gonna pay him

11:18.877 --> 11:21.479
the prime interest rate.

11:21.513 --> 11:24.782
Three percent.

11:24.816 --> 11:28.686
12.75.

11:31.623 --> 11:32.990
Okeydoke.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.759
Okeydoke.

11:35.794 --> 11:37.127
I got it.

11:37.162 --> 11:38.695
I got the money!

11:38.730 --> 11:40.931
Okay, now let's-let's do
    the proper papers here.

11:40.966 --> 11:41.966
Okay, okay.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Let's start the paperwork
            rolling.

11:43.034 --> 11:46.203
But before you buy
                  the apartment,

11:46.237 --> 11:47.938
you still have
               to be interviewed

11:47.972 --> 11:51.809
and approved by
                the co-op board.

11:51.843 --> 11:56.147
And let me tell you, they
            are very straitlaced

11:56.181 --> 11:58.015
and they have this kind
          of preconceived notion

11:58.049 --> 12:00.685
of what their neighbors
                 should be like.

12:00.719 --> 12:02.286
Oh.

12:02.321 --> 12:04.188
JIM:
Don't despair, boss.

12:04.222 --> 12:08.592
When I applied to Harvard,
          they told me

12:08.626 --> 12:13.397
I'd never get past
 their stodgy admissions board.

12:13.432 --> 12:14.999
But I did.

12:15.033 --> 12:18.269
All you've got to do
is dress nicely,

12:18.303 --> 12:21.138
shake hands firmly,

12:21.173 --> 12:24.308
and have your dad
      finance a gymnasium.

12:32.451 --> 12:34.619
ALEX:
        <i>Yeah, wait, wait,</i>
         <i>wait, hold on.</i>

12:34.653 --> 12:36.487
(knocking on door)
          Yeah, yeah.

12:36.521 --> 12:37.721
Reiger.
What the hell
are you doing?

12:37.756 --> 12:39.089
You got to help me.

12:39.123 --> 12:40.491
I've got to face that
     interview board in an hour,

12:40.525 --> 12:42.692
and I am not ready.

12:42.727 --> 12:44.061
Well, I'm not
gonna help you.

12:44.096 --> 12:47.030
There's justice in this,
         you know that?

12:47.065 --> 12:49.567
You're finally gonna have
   to take the responsibility

12:49.601 --> 12:51.736
of being what you really are.

12:51.770 --> 12:53.638
You're as ready
    as you're ever gonna be.

12:53.672 --> 12:54.972
You're wrong.

12:58.844 --> 13:00.778
I can't even pick out
        a suit, Reiger.

13:00.812 --> 13:02.380
My appearance is crucial.

13:02.414 --> 13:04.549
Oh, would you get out of here?
       I can't. I can't.

13:04.583 --> 13:05.816
I told Iggy to meet me here
        with the money.

13:05.851 --> 13:07.585
What do you think, huh?

13:07.619 --> 13:09.052
What do you think?

13:09.087 --> 13:10.488
Well, if you're really, uh,

13:10.522 --> 13:12.189
so concerned
about your appearance,

13:12.224 --> 13:13.758
you might start
with a few personal items.

13:13.792 --> 13:14.925
Like what?

13:14.960 --> 13:16.260
Like your fingernails
for one.

13:16.294 --> 13:18.562
What? You think
    they should be trimmed?

13:18.596 --> 13:20.831
I think they should
be condemned.

13:20.865 --> 13:22.633
You can at least
soak them in something

13:22.667 --> 13:24.001
to get the crud off.

13:24.035 --> 13:26.604
Great. Soak the crud off.

13:26.638 --> 13:29.073
These are the little
     grooming tips I need.

13:29.107 --> 13:31.008
(knocking on door)
I don't mean here. Not here...

13:32.777 --> 13:34.511
Oh, your banker
is here.

13:34.545 --> 13:36.947
Hi, Alex.
Hi, Jim.

13:36.981 --> 13:40.017
Iggy. Hi, Iggy.

13:40.052 --> 13:41.685
What's the boss doing?

13:41.720 --> 13:43.921
Well, you see, he's, uh,

13:43.956 --> 13:46.523
he's very self-conscious
           about his appearance.

13:48.293 --> 13:53.497
Well, then it's our job
to put him at his ease.

13:53.531 --> 13:55.465
No, no, no, no,
             Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.067
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
        What?

13:57.101 --> 13:59.102
It's all right, it's all
          right, it's all right.

13:59.137 --> 14:00.871
He's-he's gonna put
           a suit on any minute.

14:00.905 --> 14:02.206
Don't worry about it.
All right.

14:02.241 --> 14:03.373
Come on, come on, Reiger,
       you got to help me

14:03.408 --> 14:04.608
pick a suit for the interview.

14:04.642 --> 14:05.743
No, I don't.

14:07.012 --> 14:09.113
All right then,
  if you're not gonna help me

14:09.147 --> 14:10.414
pick the clothes out,

14:10.448 --> 14:12.048
at least you can
come with me.

14:12.083 --> 14:13.250
I'm not gonna go with you.

14:13.285 --> 14:14.752
Then help me pick
out a suit.

14:14.786 --> 14:17.121
What are you going
     so nuts over this for?

14:17.155 --> 14:18.322
Because I don't
want to be beat

14:18.356 --> 14:19.790
by the system again,
all right?

14:19.824 --> 14:20.925
What system?

14:20.959 --> 14:22.459
The system.

14:22.494 --> 14:23.627
You know,

14:23.661 --> 14:26.563
like when some guy
thinks that,

14:26.597 --> 14:28.532
I don't know,
   that you don't look right,

14:28.567 --> 14:30.368
and-and you're not good enough

14:30.402 --> 14:32.703
to get something
     that you really want.

14:32.737 --> 14:34.071
I don't know, the system.

14:34.106 --> 14:35.606
I can't explain it.
    You wouldn't understand.

14:35.641 --> 14:36.941
I'll wear the blue one.

14:36.975 --> 14:38.742
No, I think I understand that.

14:38.777 --> 14:41.345
I think I know
   what you're talking about.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.047
You mean like when you're
     returning to your seat

14:43.081 --> 14:45.849
at a ball game and the, uh,
 usher wants to check your stub

14:45.883 --> 14:47.551
because, uh,
     you look like somebody

14:47.585 --> 14:49.586
who might have snuck in
     from the cheap seats.

14:49.621 --> 14:50.755
Like that?

14:50.789 --> 14:52.656
Yeah, yeah, like that.

14:52.690 --> 14:54.158
Yeah.

14:54.192 --> 14:57.594
When you go to a clothing store,
  you got one arm in the suit

14:57.629 --> 14:59.096
and the salesman runs off
to help another guy

14:59.130 --> 15:00.364
who looks like
a better prospect.

15:00.398 --> 15:01.699
Yeah, yeah, that's
               it, that's the...

15:01.733 --> 15:03.434
Or when you're
                 at a restaurant

15:03.468 --> 15:05.035
and they seat you
at a table...

15:05.070 --> 15:06.670
They seat you with the guy
            with the rented tie.

15:06.704 --> 15:08.372
Or the rented jacket.
                Yeah, like that.

15:08.406 --> 15:11.241
Yeah, or when you walk into
   a bank to open an account

15:11.275 --> 15:14.545
and a security guard undoes
    the flap on his holster.

15:14.579 --> 15:16.647
ALEX:
                        Exactly.

15:16.681 --> 15:18.115
Exactly.

15:18.150 --> 15:19.550
That's exactly
    what I'm talking about.

15:19.584 --> 15:21.084
You don't think I know
       about the system?

15:21.119 --> 15:22.552
I know about the system.

15:24.022 --> 15:25.122
Here, put on
the gray suit.
                  The gray suit.

15:25.156 --> 15:26.357
Wear the gray suit.
                      Gray suit.

15:26.391 --> 15:27.692
And I'm gonna give you
one of my ties.

15:27.726 --> 15:29.493
Reiger, Reiger,
            will you go with me?

15:29.528 --> 15:30.661
Yeah, I'll go with you.

15:30.695 --> 15:31.828
Oh, good.

15:33.765 --> 15:36.400
Here. Put this one on.

15:36.434 --> 15:38.001
Oh, ooh.

15:38.036 --> 15:40.571
All right. All right,
look, look, Reiger--

15:40.605 --> 15:43.006
that's very nice-- look, you
don't have to say anything.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.375
All you've got to do
is-is watch me, you know,

15:45.410 --> 15:49.046
and give me a look in case
I say something stupid.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.747
What do you mean,
              "give you a look"?

15:50.782 --> 15:53.384
LOUIE:
                   I don't know.
  Perhaps something like this?

15:54.452 --> 15:56.687
Iggy, will you cut it out.

15:56.721 --> 15:59.657
Do you...
  do you still love me, boss?

15:59.691 --> 16:01.525
You got 48 grand in your jeans?

16:01.559 --> 16:02.426
You bet.

16:02.460 --> 16:06.063
You're my heart's desire.

16:06.097 --> 16:08.532
(doorbell chimes)

16:08.567 --> 16:10.401
Very lovely.

16:19.945 --> 16:22.279
Welcome,
                  Miss Marshall.

16:22.313 --> 16:23.414
I'm Mrs. Gwinn.

16:23.448 --> 16:25.716
This is Mr. Blount
                 and Mr. Parker.

16:25.751 --> 16:28.919
Gentlemen, this is
                  Miss Marshall.

16:28.954 --> 16:31.655
She's interested
in buying 16-B.

16:34.325 --> 16:37.761
Well, I see you have quite
            a nice annual income

16:37.795 --> 16:39.663
for a single person.

16:39.698 --> 16:42.766
That's her weekly income.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.402
No.

16:46.938 --> 16:49.607
What exactly do you do
      for all that money?

16:49.641 --> 16:52.342
I star in a television
         comedy series.

16:52.377 --> 16:54.077
Uh, maybe you've seen it.

16:54.112 --> 16:55.412
It's been on for
                    eight years.

16:57.515 --> 17:01.017
It's on every day
    and at night, you know,

17:01.052 --> 17:04.121
¶ Schlemiel, Schlimazel,
  Hasenpfeffer Incorporated ¶

17:04.155 --> 17:06.123
One, two, three..."

17:06.157 --> 17:07.723
Do you have any kids?

17:07.759 --> 17:10.094
Can you describe it?

17:10.127 --> 17:13.262
Well, um,

17:13.298 --> 17:16.433
it's more like
    a physical comedy show.

17:16.467 --> 17:17.367
Physical?

17:17.402 --> 17:19.502
Yeah, like last week
     I was in a space suit

17:19.538 --> 17:21.238
flying across the room
     doing flips and stuff.

17:21.272 --> 17:22.506
And another week

17:22.540 --> 17:24.942
I was in a fish tank
      swimming around with fish.

17:24.976 --> 17:26.844
And then the other week
        I was a chicken.

17:26.877 --> 17:30.614
They pay you all that money
        to be a chicken?

17:30.649 --> 17:32.183
I just don't act like a chicken.

17:32.217 --> 17:34.151
It's based on reality.

17:34.185 --> 17:37.354
You know, see, I had to live
  in a store window for a week

17:37.389 --> 17:38.689
and I was claustrophobic,

17:38.723 --> 17:41.024
so they sent for a hypnotist,
        and so he hypnotized me,

17:41.059 --> 17:43.794
but every time a bell went off,
    I acted like a chicken.

17:43.829 --> 17:48.465
If I ding like a bell,
   would you do the chicken?

17:48.499 --> 17:51.168
Oh, please, lady.

17:51.203 --> 17:54.037
Oh, please, you do want to live
  in this building, don't you?

17:54.072 --> 17:55.639
Oh, go on,
please.

17:55.673 --> 17:56.507
Ding.

17:56.541 --> 17:58.875
(imitating chicken clucking)

18:03.748 --> 18:05.716
(laughing)

18:11.523 --> 18:13.223
Thank you, Miss Marshall.

18:15.360 --> 18:18.328
We, speaking truthfully,

18:18.363 --> 18:21.665
don't like the lifestyle

18:21.699 --> 18:26.303
or the type of people
associated with show business.

18:26.338 --> 18:28.638
Frankly...

18:28.673 --> 18:30.807
we wouldn't allow an
              actor to live here

18:30.842 --> 18:32.910
even if he were English.

18:35.780 --> 18:38.582
Good day, Miss Marshall.

18:38.616 --> 18:40.784
Good day?

18:40.819 --> 18:43.754
Because I'm an actress?

18:43.788 --> 18:45.088
I didn't even want
to do the chicken.

18:45.122 --> 18:48.759
She rang the bell.

18:48.793 --> 18:51.795
Look, I happen to work very hard
      at being an actress,

18:51.829 --> 18:54.565
and I'm very proud of being one.

18:54.599 --> 18:57.201
You know, acting happens to be

18:57.235 --> 19:00.503
a very noble and dignified
          profession.

19:00.538 --> 19:02.372
So on behalf of myself

19:02.407 --> 19:04.207
and all the other members
       of my profession,

19:04.242 --> 19:07.844
there's just one thing that
  I'd like to say to you all.

19:19.056 --> 19:20.991
I didn't know you lived
       in this building.

19:21.025 --> 19:24.028
Boy, I'm getting into
    some classy building.
                            Hey.

19:24.062 --> 19:26.095
No, no, no, I'm not living
       in this building.

19:26.130 --> 19:28.164
They rejected me
    because I'm an actress.

19:28.199 --> 19:30.433
Look, I don't know what you do
         for a living,

19:30.468 --> 19:31.568
but if they accept you,

19:31.602 --> 19:33.903
please don't let me know.

19:38.843 --> 19:42.713
Uh, that woman
     looked very familiar.

19:42.747 --> 19:44.781
She's an actress.

19:44.815 --> 19:46.250
She's not gonna live
       in this building?

19:46.284 --> 19:47.918
Oh, no.

19:52.456 --> 19:55.426
No, no, no,
        we rejected her.

19:55.460 --> 19:57.594
We can begin.

19:59.164 --> 20:01.464
Uh, this is Alex Reiger.

20:01.499 --> 20:03.100
Hi.

20:03.134 --> 20:04.802
See, he's
my accountant.

20:04.836 --> 20:08.572
What do you do
for a living, Mr. De Palma?

20:08.606 --> 20:10.307
Well, uh,

20:10.341 --> 20:14.978
I'm-I'm a supervisor
  in the transportation field.

20:15.012 --> 20:17.848
Mr. De Palma is
              a taxi dispatcher.

20:17.882 --> 20:20.517
It's an honest job providing
    a very valuable service

20:20.551 --> 20:22.252
to the people of this city.

20:22.286 --> 20:23.987
Anything wrong with that?

20:24.021 --> 20:26.690
Mr. De Palma,
you're Italian.

20:26.724 --> 20:28.225
Is that right?

20:28.259 --> 20:29.593
Yes, I'm...

20:29.627 --> 20:30.594
Why do you ask that?

20:30.628 --> 20:33.129
I'm sorry,
    I'm not talking to you.

20:33.164 --> 20:36.100
Oh, uh, I don't mean that.

20:36.134 --> 20:38.535
Reiger, Reiger, Reiger...
               I mean, what does
                    that matter.

20:38.570 --> 20:39.970
I mean, does
                  that determine

20:40.005 --> 20:41.204
whether he gets into
            the building or not?

20:41.239 --> 20:43.574
Do you object to
          certain ethnic groups,

20:43.608 --> 20:45.075
is that-is that
                     what it is?

20:45.109 --> 20:46.209
Reiger...

20:46.243 --> 20:47.411
No, no, Mr. Reiger,

20:47.445 --> 20:48.812
we have all kinds
       in this building,

20:48.846 --> 20:51.448
including three Jewish people.

20:51.483 --> 20:56.386
Oh, and what makes you
    assume that I'm Jewish?

20:56.421 --> 20:58.155
Point well made, sir.

20:58.189 --> 21:01.558
We-we shouldn't
      jump to conclusions.

21:01.592 --> 21:03.727
Perhaps someone in his family
         was a pelican.

21:03.761 --> 21:05.128
(laughing)

21:05.163 --> 21:06.629
Reiger, Reiger, Reiger.
               (angry muttering)

21:06.664 --> 21:09.266
Pelican... the pelican,
it's a regal bird,

21:09.300 --> 21:11.235
it's a noble bird,
it's a fine bird.

21:11.269 --> 21:12.469
A very good bird.

21:12.503 --> 21:13.837
It was a compliment.

21:13.871 --> 21:15.872
Please, please, please,
    please, please, please,

21:15.906 --> 21:17.907
please, please, Reiger...

21:24.916 --> 21:28.051
What kind of friends
   do you have, Mr. De Palma?

21:28.086 --> 21:30.887
What? What do you, what are you
asking something like that for?

21:30.921 --> 21:32.389
We have to know
      what sort of people

21:32.424 --> 21:33.857
will be coming and going
        in our building.

21:33.892 --> 21:35.926
Oh, you do, do you?

21:35.960 --> 21:38.595
I never entertain.

21:38.629 --> 21:40.330
Oh, now, now, now, Louie.

21:40.364 --> 21:41.998
Let's be honest.
      No, let's be honest.

21:42.033 --> 21:43.634
Once a year the British
     ambassador comes over

21:43.668 --> 21:45.502
(with British accent):
     for a spot of sherry.

21:45.536 --> 21:46.904
Is that all right with you?

21:46.938 --> 21:49.038
You're very hostile,
Mr. Reiger.

21:49.073 --> 21:50.440
Yes, you bet I am.

21:50.475 --> 21:52.576
And I'm getting so, more so,
         by the minute.

21:52.610 --> 21:54.278
I don't like anything
     that's been said here.

21:54.312 --> 21:55.311
You don't need this.

21:55.346 --> 21:56.447
You don't need
                   these people.

21:56.481 --> 21:58.415
You don't need
               this humiliation.

21:58.450 --> 22:00.750
No... no apartment
   in this city is worth it.

22:00.785 --> 22:02.185
Let them sell to one
              of their own kind,

22:02.219 --> 22:03.987
one of them as pompous and
  self-righteous as they are.

22:04.022 --> 22:05.522
Come on, Louie,
     let's get out of here.

22:11.229 --> 22:13.730
You're fired.

22:13.764 --> 22:16.032
You are no longer
my accountant.

22:16.067 --> 22:18.435
What could I say?

22:18.470 --> 22:20.237
I don't know what
got into the man.

22:20.271 --> 22:21.972
He came highly
recommended.

22:22.006 --> 22:24.241
Look, I never want
               to cause a scene,

22:24.275 --> 22:27.110
but, uh, I mean,
      his... his rudeness

22:27.145 --> 22:29.980
was just too much,
       just intolerable.

22:30.014 --> 22:33.617
Well, well, well,
Mr. De Palma.

22:33.651 --> 22:37.054
I think you've shown us
what we need to know.

22:37.088 --> 22:39.223
Welcome to the building.

22:40.925 --> 22:42.526
Call me Louis.

22:45.629 --> 22:48.231
Wait a minute, Louie.

22:48.266 --> 22:50.501
Are you gonna
     go through with this?

22:50.535 --> 22:52.402
So that you can have
  the privilege of living here

22:52.436 --> 22:55.005
with these-these posturing
         chowderheads?

22:59.810 --> 23:02.345
And you're gonna allow
 this-this canker sore of a man

23:02.380 --> 23:03.913
into your building?

23:03.948 --> 23:05.782
To live with
                  day after day,

23:05.816 --> 23:09.119
possibly for the rest
         of your lives?

23:09.154 --> 23:10.954
That's right,
Mr. Reiger.

23:10.988 --> 23:13.256
And what are you going
to do about it?

23:13.290 --> 23:16.093
(chuckles)

23:16.127 --> 23:18.594
Cartwheels, all the way home.

23:33.244 --> 23:36.646
(theme song playing)

23:57.935 --> 23:59.435
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

23:59.470 --> 24:00.804
(man grumbling)
