11:30.983 --> 11:33.598
So, shall we go and play happy families?

11:33.608 --> 11:36.056
TOM: Yes. Great.

11:36.066 --> 11:38.515
SHIV: Mm-hmm.

11:38.525 --> 11:39.932
Well done on Tom.

11:39.942 --> 11:42.431
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

11:42.441 --> 11:44.640
Tell me again why you're marrying him.

11:44.650 --> 11:47.181
- Mom. Come on.
- Joking. I like...

11:47.191 --> 11:49.473
- I like him!
- OK.

11:49.483 --> 11:52.973
And I want to say
I hope this can be nice.

11:52.983 --> 11:55.306
I really appreciate
your coming over here.

11:55.316 --> 11:57.431
OK. It's no worries.

11:57.441 --> 12:00.598
My travel agent
specializes in guilt trips.

12:00.608 --> 12:02.181
Hey! Hey!

12:02.191 --> 12:05.181
Apologies. Did I miss anything?

12:05.191 --> 12:08.181
- No.
- Happy day.

12:08.191 --> 12:11.807
Caroline Collingwood.
Pleased to meet you.

12:11.817 --> 12:14.348
Likewise, your excellency.

12:14.358 --> 12:16.348
Gregory Hirsch.

12:16.358 --> 12:17.848
Greg!

12:17.858 --> 12:20.932
- You're Greg Egg.
- Excuse me?

12:20.942 --> 12:22.682
You're Greg the Egg!

12:22.692 --> 12:25.264
When you were born you looked
like a little misshapen egg.

12:25.274 --> 12:28.848
I... did... Yeah, I did hear tell of...

12:28.858 --> 12:34.348
Oh, God. And your dad used to try and
sleep with all the men in Sausalito.

12:34.358 --> 12:35.566
(GRUNTS)

12:37.983 --> 12:39.473
How's your mother?

12:39.483 --> 12:41.014
Uh, good. OK, yeah.

12:41.024 --> 12:43.973
Solvent, currently. Debt free.

12:43.983 --> 12:46.390
Great. Come on in.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.348
Come and see our little church.

12:48.358 --> 12:50.348
(PHONE BUZZING)

12:50.358 --> 12:54.014
These are all my disreputable
slave-owning ancestors.

12:54.024 --> 12:55.692
Very nice.

12:59.108 --> 13:01.973
- Oh, my God. Tom, did you see?
- What, Greg?

13:01.983 --> 13:04.932
- Did I see what?
- That's the girl from Brooklyn.

13:04.942 --> 13:06.431
From your bachelor party.

13:06.441 --> 13:08.807
Who sucked your dick and
made you swallow your load.

13:08.817 --> 13:10.640
Greg, that's not very wedding-y.

13:10.650 --> 13:12.306
- But that's her.
- I know.

13:12.316 --> 13:15.390
Greg, her name is Tabitha,
and she and Roman are dating.

13:15.400 --> 13:19.108
Which is cool. So please, do not
act like an unsophisticated rube.

13:20.566 --> 13:22.181
- OK. Wow.
- Yeah.

13:22.191 --> 13:23.723
He really liked her, and it's fine.

13:23.733 --> 13:25.431
It's just one of
those weird urban things,

13:25.441 --> 13:27.264
like when you go to see standup

13:27.274 --> 13:29.139
and the comedian is your dentist.

13:29.149 --> 13:31.264
- OK? Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah... Oh!

13:31.274 --> 13:33.098
- Hey!
- Hey.

13:33.108 --> 13:34.682
- Hey!
- So,

13:34.692 --> 13:37.233
- we should, uh, get going.
- Yeah, let's do it.

13:39.525 --> 13:42.733
I'm Willa, by the way.
I'm Connor's partner.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.848
Fantastic. And what do you do, Willa?

13:46.858 --> 13:49.566
Oh, um, I'm a playwright.

13:50.775 --> 13:52.181
- Wow. Fantastic.
- Yeah.

13:52.191 --> 13:54.682
- Thank you.
- America.

13:54.692 --> 13:56.932
And what do you do, Connor?

13:56.942 --> 13:58.932
Well, um...

13:58.942 --> 14:02.765
Connor doesn't really do anything.

14:02.775 --> 14:04.274
Do you, Con?

14:06.358 --> 14:09.306
I think they're all
gathered now, Patrick.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.108
- Shall we?
- What?

14:13.608 --> 14:14.942
What?

14:17.108 --> 14:18.264
Shit.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.014
Just to get things straight,

14:20.024 --> 14:23.098
am I right that the father...
I understand the father...

14:23.108 --> 14:24.390
CAROLINE: Couldn't be bothered.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.932
(AWKWARD LAUGHTER)

14:25.942 --> 14:27.598
He's... He's not well. He's not well.

14:27.608 --> 14:29.306
CAROLINE: Yeah, that's the story.

14:29.316 --> 14:31.108
Everyone remember the story.

14:32.483 --> 14:37.306
So, uh, I will be performing
the father role.

14:37.316 --> 14:39.274
VICAR: Great.

14:47.692 --> 14:51.431
Listen, I didn't mean you
don't do anything. Just...

14:51.441 --> 14:54.390
Well, that's a shame,
because that's what you said.

14:54.400 --> 14:57.306
No, you know, I mean, nothing
like my writing. Nothing...

14:57.316 --> 15:00.890
Safeguarding 30,000 acres of
wilderness, that's nothing?

15:00.900 --> 15:04.348
Being on the verge of setting up
a podcast on Napoleonic history

15:04.358 --> 15:07.306
with a considerable level of
investment interest, that's nothing?

15:07.316 --> 15:09.289
- No, sure, it's...
- Crackin' the nut of happiness

15:09.300 --> 15:11.223
like a modern day Thoreau,
well, that's nothing.

15:11.233 --> 15:14.556
Con. You're great, OK?

15:14.566 --> 15:16.765
You are. I...

15:16.775 --> 15:19.149
It was a dumb thing to say.

15:20.983 --> 15:22.682
Well, here we are.

15:22.692 --> 15:25.139
The ancestral home
Caroline didn't inherit.

15:25.149 --> 15:27.848
The thorn in her side,
the fishbone in her throat.

15:27.858 --> 15:30.692
When we were kids, she wouldn't
even let us look at it.

15:32.108 --> 15:33.682
What do you think?

15:33.692 --> 15:36.807
I mean, it's massive!

15:36.817 --> 15:38.348
I hate it.

15:38.358 --> 15:41.473
- KENDALL: Hey, so, listen.
- FRANK: Mm-hmm?

15:41.483 --> 15:43.848
You know the Canadians, right?

15:43.858 --> 15:45.306
Yves, et cetera?

15:45.316 --> 15:47.292
The pension fund guys?

15:47.303 --> 15:48.400
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:49.692 --> 15:51.348
What do they think of me?

15:51.358 --> 15:54.348
How do you mean? What's the context?

15:54.358 --> 15:56.473
I can't give you context.

15:56.483 --> 15:59.274
OK. That's very interesting context.

16:00.566 --> 16:04.098
- Look, as a pal...
- Uh-huh?

16:04.108 --> 16:05.723
(SIGHS)

16:05.733 --> 16:09.723
Say there was a situation
where private equity

16:09.733 --> 16:12.431
was trying to buy out
a major media company

16:12.441 --> 16:14.306
and install a new CEO.

16:14.316 --> 16:16.139
- How would they view me?
- Are you serious?

16:16.149 --> 16:19.139
Fuck. So what, they're co-investors?

16:19.149 --> 16:20.556
Come on, you know those guys.

16:20.566 --> 16:22.556
Behind closed doors,
are they of the opinion

16:22.566 --> 16:24.765
I'm the real deal,

16:24.775 --> 16:26.765
or in training?

16:26.775 --> 16:30.848
And would there be room
to wet the beak of an old pal

16:30.858 --> 16:33.807
- in such a situation?
- Frank, too soon. Too soon.

16:33.817 --> 16:35.181
Get your hard-on out of my soup.

16:35.191 --> 16:36.207
OK.

16:37.650 --> 16:39.723
- So?
- Well...

16:39.733 --> 16:41.348
I think they have a lot of time for you,

16:41.358 --> 16:43.598
but there may be certain questions.

16:43.608 --> 16:46.098
- Oh, shit.
- Well, you know,

16:46.108 --> 16:47.765
they think they're hot shots.

16:47.775 --> 16:49.775
They make hard jokes.

16:51.650 --> 16:53.515
As in?

16:53.525 --> 16:57.348
Well, sometimes when you were absent

16:57.358 --> 17:00.775
they used to refer to you
as "the calamari cock ring."

17:02.525 --> 17:04.263
I don't even know what that means.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.890
I think it means they think
of me as a cock ring

17:06.900 --> 17:09.013
made from calamari, Frank,

17:09.023 --> 17:10.807
it's pretty self-explanatory.

17:10.817 --> 17:12.848
- So what do we say?
- Well, I thought

17:12.858 --> 17:14.682
we were gonna say "illness."

17:14.692 --> 17:16.138
No, I don't like illness. Plays weak.

17:16.148 --> 17:17.858
OK, we can say "busy."

17:17.983 --> 17:21.138
What prick's too busy to attend
his own daughter's wedding?

17:21.148 --> 17:23.056
OK, "family rift."

17:23.066 --> 17:26.973
But we background brief that
Gil's campaign is like a cult.

17:26.983 --> 17:31.640
"What is this grieving senator's
mysterious hold on Shiv Roy?"

17:31.650 --> 17:33.139
We sprinkle some of that.

17:33.149 --> 17:35.848
It makes her look weak.
And it makes me look like I'm...

17:35.858 --> 17:38.431
None of my kids have gone round
the bend, or offed themselves.

17:38.441 --> 17:40.640
We've always pushed
that you're a good dad.

17:40.650 --> 17:42.807
- Because?
- Because you are a good dad.

17:42.817 --> 17:44.973
Huh.

17:44.983 --> 17:48.056
So, if you don't want to say, I mean,

17:48.066 --> 17:50.723
work or illness or...

17:50.733 --> 17:53.014
rift, do we just...

17:53.024 --> 17:55.556
Fuck it. There's no way out.

17:55.566 --> 17:57.473
I mean, if you want to go...

17:57.483 --> 18:00.139
I don't want to go.

18:00.149 --> 18:03.264
But there's no other fucking way out.

18:03.274 --> 18:05.692
(PARTY CHATTER)

18:08.483 --> 18:10.723
We can do whatever you want us to do,

18:10.733 --> 18:13.348
and I'm so sorry if you think
we've done the wrong thing,

18:13.358 --> 18:15.848
but they literally just called
and told us he was coming.

18:15.858 --> 18:19.056
- KENDALL: Who's coming?
- SHIV: Dad. And Marcia.

18:19.066 --> 18:22.525
- Wait... Dad's coming... here?
- SHIV: Yeah.

18:24.191 --> 18:26.139
I thought you didn't want him to.

18:26.149 --> 18:27.181
I don't.

18:27.191 --> 18:28.890
I mean, it's your wedding, so...

18:28.900 --> 18:30.098
Yeah. I don't want him here.

18:30.108 --> 18:31.598
He's never apologized.

18:31.608 --> 18:33.682
But Marcia called Tom, and...

18:33.692 --> 18:35.765
And obviously I had to ask Shiv.

18:35.775 --> 18:38.264
Meanwhile, she's already
called Charlotte,

18:38.274 --> 18:40.640
- and they're on their way.
- Dad's coming?

18:40.650 --> 18:43.056
Is it about the launch? Is he concerned?

18:43.066 --> 18:45.223
Yeah, I'm sure he's
thinking about that 24/7.

18:45.233 --> 18:47.890
So, I mean, what are you gonna do?

18:47.900 --> 18:51.556
- You could just say no.
- Yeah. I could.

18:51.566 --> 18:54.390
But what, just get security
to fucking stop him?

18:54.400 --> 18:56.306
- TOM: Hold on.
- I could do that.

18:56.316 --> 18:58.890
Yeah you could, but it might
cause a funny atmosphere,

18:58.900 --> 19:01.056
because he did pay for all this.

19:01.066 --> 19:04.223
If he's got the stones to walk
in here, what are we gonna do?

19:04.233 --> 19:07.014
Put the dogs on him? Tell him
there's no seat, he's gotta stand?

19:07.024 --> 19:08.692
He's given us no choice.

19:10.358 --> 19:12.390
So now I hear he is coming.

19:12.400 --> 19:16.223
- Yeah.
- Well, that's wonderful.

19:16.233 --> 19:18.098
- Oh, come on, Mom.
- No, no. It's fine.

19:18.108 --> 19:20.640
I just hope you won't forget about me

19:20.650 --> 19:22.056
when your father arrives

19:22.066 --> 19:25.264
with the head of his
Middle Eastern operations.

19:25.274 --> 19:27.932
- Marcia?
- Yeah, Marcia.

19:27.942 --> 19:31.608
Do you still find her
a bit...? You know.

19:34.525 --> 19:37.807
Actually, we became quite
close during Dad's illness.

19:37.817 --> 19:39.181
Oh, well.

19:39.191 --> 19:41.723
What a sweet little scene
that must have been.

19:41.733 --> 19:43.598
Very touching, I'm sure.

19:43.608 --> 19:47.098
- Actually, it's quite good.
- Why?

19:47.108 --> 19:50.900
Just your being the second-most
important person at your wedding.

19:52.483 --> 19:54.056
Take the pressure off.

19:54.066 --> 19:57.149
(LIGHT JAZZ COMBO PLAYING)

20:01.024 --> 20:02.942
(CHATTER)

20:05.441 --> 20:08.306
Mm. Oh, this is delicious.

20:08.316 --> 20:10.181
Well, I'm very glad you like it.

20:10.191 --> 20:11.932
Because it cost a pretty penny.

20:11.942 --> 20:15.024
Well, it's delicious. It tastes like it.

20:17.149 --> 20:19.973
- Um, sorry. Just a second?
- Oh, no. Of course.

20:19.983 --> 20:21.264
- Hi. Excuse me.
- Hi there.

20:21.274 --> 20:24.390
Got any protein for us to use?

20:24.400 --> 20:27.431
Protein? I'm not a fuckin' hen
to lay you eggs.

20:27.441 --> 20:31.765
- I'm a strategist.
- I know. It's just... Gil.

20:31.775 --> 20:34.431
- What?
- He'd like a word.

20:34.441 --> 20:35.464
OK.

20:50.149 --> 20:53.014
- Hey. Hey!
- FATHER: Hey. How ya doin'?

20:53.024 --> 20:55.973
I gotta say, you knocked it
out of the park with the wine.

20:55.983 --> 20:57.556
- It's delicious.
- (GLASSES CLINK)

20:57.566 --> 20:59.598
Gil.

20:59.608 --> 21:02.098
Listen, I don't mean
to be overly dramatic,

21:02.108 --> 21:04.223
but I was assured when I accepted

21:04.233 --> 21:05.932
that your father wouldn't be here.

21:05.942 --> 21:08.640
I know. Plans changed, I was ambushed.

21:08.650 --> 21:11.181
This is not OK from my POV, Siobhan.

21:11.191 --> 21:12.682
This compromises me.

21:12.692 --> 21:15.014
And you were very eager
that Gil would come along.

21:15.024 --> 21:16.223
I mean, it's...

21:16.233 --> 21:17.848
Well, yeah, when I invited you

21:17.858 --> 21:19.723
I didn't realize
it was gonna be a chore.

21:19.733 --> 21:21.223
He's just weighty, Shiv.

21:21.233 --> 21:23.348
He carries his gravity.

21:23.358 --> 21:25.515
He's not a man, he's a fucking planet.

21:25.525 --> 21:27.556
Look, there's no press,
and there's no pictures.

21:27.566 --> 21:30.598
We got jammers and a fucking
hawk to take out drones.

21:30.608 --> 21:31.900
It'll be like it never happened.

21:33.400 --> 21:35.431
I hear you might have
something explosive

21:35.441 --> 21:36.723
I can use.

21:36.733 --> 21:38.848
Yeah, maybe. I'm working on it.

21:38.858 --> 21:40.191
But just not yet.

21:41.775 --> 21:43.765
Let's destroy ATN, Shiv.

21:43.775 --> 21:46.223
Wouldn't that be a nice wedding gift

21:47.441 --> 21:48.848
Oh, yeah, sure,

21:48.858 --> 21:50.723
I'm just concerned
about collateral damage.

21:50.733 --> 21:53.306
- Tom.
- NATE: Tom?

21:53.316 --> 21:55.306
- He'll be fine.
- Says the man

21:55.316 --> 21:57.617
who has literally no idea
what he's even talking about.

21:57.628 --> 21:58.973
GIL: Shiv, come on.

21:58.983 --> 22:02.598
I have all the arguments
on monopolies, and news,

22:02.608 --> 22:04.723
and the coarsening of the public sphere,

22:04.733 --> 22:07.098
but I kind of start falling asleep

22:07.108 --> 22:08.682
when I hear myself talk.

22:08.692 --> 22:11.390
Give me something salty, Shiv.
Get me a stick of dynamite

22:11.400 --> 22:13.556
I can shove up his fuckin' ass!

22:13.566 --> 22:15.098
OK, I get that.

22:15.108 --> 22:17.598
Come here. You know Gil.

22:17.608 --> 22:19.098
Yeah, sure.

22:19.108 --> 22:20.723
Pleased to meet you, Senator Eavis.

22:20.733 --> 22:22.515
Likewise.

22:22.525 --> 22:25.098
How are you finding it
outside the evil empire?

22:25.108 --> 22:27.431
Oh, fine. I'm fine, thank you.

22:27.441 --> 22:29.598
And how do you like it
here in the lion's den?

22:29.608 --> 22:31.181
Oh, I've been to zoos before.

22:31.191 --> 22:33.932
You like drinking our champagne?

22:33.942 --> 22:36.556
I'm a "champagne for all" guy,

22:36.566 --> 22:38.765
not a "gruel for all" guy.

22:38.775 --> 22:40.848
Hey, you know Senator Eavis.

22:40.858 --> 22:42.765
Sword of the dispossessed

22:42.775 --> 22:44.807
and lover of vintage champagne.

22:44.817 --> 22:47.223
I guess technically,
I should take a swing at you.

22:47.233 --> 22:49.515
Technically, I should
call you libelous scum.

22:49.525 --> 22:51.431
Are you gonna calm the shit-talk down,

22:51.441 --> 22:53.473
or are we gonna have to ramp things up?

22:53.483 --> 22:56.973
Is your dad gonna stop poisoning the
discourse of our great republic?

22:56.983 --> 22:58.598
Have you got a laptop?

22:58.608 --> 23:01.306
Do you see the shit out there?
We're the fucking good guys now.

23:01.316 --> 23:03.807
Join in, by the way. Feel free.

23:03.817 --> 23:05.473
- (GRUNTS)
- No?

23:05.483 --> 23:08.640
Shiv? I mean, your guy here
is shit-talkin' our company.

23:08.650 --> 23:10.973
Oh, yeah, we don't talk about that.

23:10.983 --> 23:13.306
That would be a conflict of interest.

23:13.316 --> 23:14.932
Oh, lies!

23:14.942 --> 23:17.264
Oh, 'cause you... Yeah, the lies.

23:17.274 --> 23:20.223
Can't wait for the big one
tomorrow. Right?

23:20.233 --> 23:23.223
Well, these hands
aren't gonna fuck themselves.

23:23.233 --> 23:26.024
ROMAN: Nice to meet you, Senator Beavis.

23:35.108 --> 23:37.431
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

23:37.441 --> 23:40.390
- Nice to finally meet you.
- Tom Wambsgans.

23:40.400 --> 23:42.223
Obviously. Nate.

23:42.233 --> 23:43.890
Uh-huh. Right.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.223
Right.

23:45.233 --> 23:47.932
I just wanted to say
thanks for having me.

23:47.942 --> 23:49.807
I'm Tabitha.

23:49.817 --> 23:52.348
Hi. Well, I've heard
very little about you.

23:52.358 --> 23:54.390
What can I say?

23:54.400 --> 23:55.431
Best man won.

23:55.441 --> 23:57.932
Ha ha. As in?

23:57.942 --> 23:59.682
You won the Shiv-off, pal.

23:59.692 --> 24:00.807
Good luck.

24:00.817 --> 24:03.692
Right. And who... who are you again?

24:05.024 --> 24:07.139
Nate? Sofrelli?

24:07.149 --> 24:10.181
Did she never... This is embarrassing.

24:10.191 --> 24:14.056
- Are you a pal of Kendall's?
- Yes.

24:14.066 --> 24:16.056
- OK. Ah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:16.066 --> 24:18.682
And Shiv and I, uh,
back in ancient history we...

24:18.692 --> 24:20.264
Oh, right. Oh! Oh, I see.

24:20.274 --> 24:21.848
Oh, OK, maybe she did.

24:21.858 --> 24:23.306
- Right.
- Maybe she did.

24:23.316 --> 24:25.765
- Ah. The best man won.
- (NATE LAUGHS)

24:25.775 --> 24:27.733
Maybe.

24:31.817 --> 24:34.848
There was an uncle who ended up
living in Gibraltar with a monkey,

24:34.858 --> 24:38.890
and he swindled my mom's grandpa.

24:38.900 --> 24:42.139
We used to come here as kids.
She lives nearby.

24:42.149 --> 24:44.566
Oh, very good. Keep the
wound fresh and all that.

24:46.692 --> 24:48.390
You know what, I'm gonna split.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.682
I can see my husband-to-be
talking to my ex,

24:50.692 --> 24:52.556
and it's making me feel
like I want to hurl.

24:52.566 --> 24:54.608
- So, great to meet you.
- Yeah, fair. You too.

24:56.650 --> 24:58.149
NATE: Have a good night.

25:00.274 --> 25:02.264
Just to say...

25:02.274 --> 25:05.640
so kind of your parents to have
paid for all this delicious wine.

25:05.650 --> 25:07.181
Oh, not at all, not at all.

25:07.191 --> 25:09.264
They wanted to make
a contribution, so...

25:09.274 --> 25:13.390
So clever the way they're letting
every single person know.

25:13.400 --> 25:15.108
Oh. Oh, good...

25:19.775 --> 25:21.139
You OK?

25:21.149 --> 25:23.264
Yeah, I think I just
got stabbed by your mom,

25:23.274 --> 25:24.973
but I'm not completely sure.

25:24.983 --> 25:26.264
Oh, yeah, that's how it works.

25:26.274 --> 25:28.306
You'll bleed out in about an hour.

25:28.316 --> 25:31.431
Can I... Can I talk to you
for... two seconds?

25:31.441 --> 25:33.108
Uh, yeah.

25:36.566 --> 25:38.765
So I just wanted to get you up here

25:38.775 --> 25:40.973
to talk about the table plans.

25:40.983 --> 25:43.556
Oh. And have you thought
any more about... Ow!

25:43.566 --> 25:46.431
whether you want to tell me
about the secret thing?

25:46.441 --> 25:48.807
And I just wanted to, uh, say...

25:48.817 --> 25:52.650
that I, uh, I did meet Nate.

25:55.316 --> 25:56.515
Oh, you...

25:56.525 --> 25:58.441
You've met Nate before. I think.

25:59.983 --> 26:02.139
No? Oh.

26:02.149 --> 26:04.348
Uh... Oh, well, he's a...

26:04.358 --> 26:06.181
you know, he's a good colleague,

26:06.191 --> 26:08.765
and, uh, he's a friend of Kendall's.

26:08.775 --> 26:10.932
They ran around in Shanghai together.

26:10.942 --> 26:12.306
And he's a dick.

26:12.316 --> 26:13.640
Well, he's OK, but he has

26:13.650 --> 26:15.598
a certain dickish quality about him.

26:15.608 --> 26:19.264
- Uh-huh.
- I think I've mentioned him...

26:19.274 --> 26:20.900
to you before.

26:27.733 --> 26:29.358
Look, Shiv, uh...

26:31.525 --> 26:33.181
Is this real?

26:33.191 --> 26:35.515
What do you... What do you mean?

26:35.525 --> 26:38.973
Am I... Am I a total jerk?

26:38.983 --> 26:41.640
- Uh...
- Do you really want to do this?

26:41.650 --> 26:43.640
'Cause we don't have to.

26:43.650 --> 26:45.348
Do this?

26:45.358 --> 26:49.139
- All the people are here.
- Yeah.

26:49.149 --> 26:51.682
And... besides, I want to.

26:51.692 --> 26:53.566
I do... I do want to.

26:54.692 --> 26:56.692
I mean, is this...

26:57.942 --> 26:59.848
W-What level are we on?

26:59.858 --> 27:01.348
Are you fucking around on me?

27:01.358 --> 27:03.682
- Tom.
- Honestly?

27:03.692 --> 27:05.973
This Nate...

27:05.983 --> 27:08.066
you know, I can...

27:09.733 --> 27:11.390
I can... There are vibes.

27:11.400 --> 27:15.723
Oh, Tom. What, as soon
as two colleagues are close...

27:15.733 --> 27:17.890
D.C. loves gossip.

27:17.900 --> 27:19.014
No, sure.

27:19.024 --> 27:20.556
Sometimes there are rumors,

27:20.566 --> 27:24.264
and people, you know,
they're not fucking.

27:24.274 --> 27:26.066
But sometimes they totally are.

27:29.233 --> 27:30.733
Honestly?

27:36.316 --> 27:37.900
This is real.

27:40.233 --> 27:42.566
I'm not fucking around on you.

27:52.024 --> 27:54.431
Well, I trust you.

27:54.441 --> 27:56.066
Good.

27:57.608 --> 27:59.932
Thank you.

27:59.942 --> 28:02.598
And that put... puts my mind at rest.

28:02.608 --> 28:04.817
So...

28:08.775 --> 28:11.932
You know, when...

28:11.942 --> 28:15.274
when we met, I was in such a mess.

28:17.858 --> 28:20.566
I need you. Hmm?

28:22.149 --> 28:23.483
I do.

28:27.983 --> 28:29.441
I...

28:31.400 --> 28:34.014
If you want to know
about the secret stuff,

28:34.024 --> 28:36.692
the cruise line stuff, I'll tell you.

28:39.108 --> 28:41.014
Because we have to be able to trust.

28:41.024 --> 28:42.139
Right?

28:42.149 --> 28:44.348
Yeah?

28:44.358 --> 28:46.149
Yeah, that'd be great.

28:49.400 --> 28:50.483
(SNORTING)

28:57.650 --> 29:00.139
- Hey. Hey. How ya doin'?
- Hi.

29:00.149 --> 29:03.556
- Where are the kids?
- They're upstairs.

29:03.566 --> 29:04.848
- Cool.
- They're sleeping.

29:04.858 --> 29:06.682
- Yeah. Right.
- I saw Shiv.

29:06.692 --> 29:08.807
How are the happy couple? OK?

29:08.817 --> 29:11.765
Good, you know, maintaining the veneer.

29:11.775 --> 29:14.014
Mm-hmm. You OK?

29:14.024 --> 29:17.098
I'm fantastic. I did, like,

29:17.108 --> 29:20.682
120 push-ups this morning,
so, yeah, I think I'm OK.

29:20.692 --> 29:23.014
Wow. Wow. You did 120 push-ups.

29:23.024 --> 29:24.754
Rava, I just have
a lot goin' on right now.

29:30.066 --> 29:31.682
It's not...

29:31.692 --> 29:34.525
not one of your
more relaxing interludes?

29:36.358 --> 29:38.181
Yeah. It's not.

29:38.191 --> 29:41.723
I'm, uh, I'm a big fuckin' stress knot.
What can I tell you?

29:41.733 --> 29:45.149
I probably have a tumor
eating me inside-out.

29:46.650 --> 29:48.358
You want another drink?

29:50.149 --> 29:52.473
Your lawyers have gotten
a little quiet on me,

29:52.483 --> 29:53.807
so I'm just wondering if that's...

29:53.817 --> 29:55.181
Oh, yeah, I don't know about that.

29:55.191 --> 29:57.390
Can you maybe give them a little nudge?

29:57.400 --> 29:58.400
Sure.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.056
I'll give them a nudge.

30:02.066 --> 30:04.598
Ken. Ken.

30:04.608 --> 30:05.709
Hmm?

30:07.566 --> 30:09.765
- I know you...
- Oh, yeah, you do?

30:09.775 --> 30:10.973
- Yeah, I know you.
- Really.

30:10.983 --> 30:13.640
And if you want to talk, I am here.

30:13.650 --> 30:14.807
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

30:14.817 --> 30:17.191
Well, I'm good.

30:19.108 --> 30:20.191
Hmm.

30:24.400 --> 30:25.932
Yeah, you know what,

30:25.942 --> 30:27.723
the truth is my lawyers are stonewalling

30:27.733 --> 30:30.431
because your lawyers
are trying to fuck me over.

30:30.441 --> 30:33.431
So shall we just leave it to them,

30:33.441 --> 30:36.306
and then you and me can just flirt

30:36.316 --> 30:39.723
and you can do your whole
la-dee-fuckin'-da smile

30:39.733 --> 30:43.056
and we can just be all chummy and
everything because I love all that shit?

30:43.066 --> 30:45.390
Have a fuckin' line
if you need one that badly.

30:45.400 --> 30:46.431
Yeah, I will, OK?

30:46.441 --> 30:47.807
- Fuck you.
- Thanks.

30:47.817 --> 30:49.848
Everything isn't what you think.
You know?

30:49.858 --> 30:52.811
You can't see inside me just 'cause
I've told you the occasional...

31:01.400 --> 31:02.483
MAN: Sorry.

31:06.191 --> 31:08.942
(JAZZ COMBO CONTINUES PLAYING)

31:23.650 --> 31:25.561
Well, well, well. What the
fuck's going on here?

31:25.572 --> 31:28.056
This looks mighty fucking cozy.

31:28.066 --> 31:30.723
Um... hi. Hi, Kendall.

31:30.733 --> 31:32.890
- Hi.
- We were just...

31:32.900 --> 31:35.848
well, we were just saying that I think
that the first time I came here

31:35.858 --> 31:38.139
was back when you guys
were kids, like...

31:38.149 --> 31:39.807
maybe 1986, I think?

31:39.817 --> 31:41.807
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right.
- Remember that?

31:41.817 --> 31:45.181
Right. Great. (CLEARS THROAT)

31:45.191 --> 31:48.973
Sorry. I'm sorry. I should, uh...

31:48.983 --> 31:50.640
circulate.

31:50.650 --> 31:52.264
- OK.
- All rightie.

31:52.274 --> 31:54.316
- We'll see ya later.
- Yep.

31:57.066 --> 32:01.473
Well, I'm happy to tell, but
do we have to do it tonight?

32:01.483 --> 32:04.807
You know, 'cause it's about the
corporate cover-up of crimes

32:04.817 --> 32:07.139
and institutionalized sexual abuse.

32:07.149 --> 32:08.598
Oh, fuck.

32:08.608 --> 32:12.515
Well... bad for Dad. Great for Gil.

32:12.525 --> 32:14.890
It's not very "wedding-y."

32:14.900 --> 32:16.858
Yeah, still...

32:19.692 --> 32:21.848
OK. So...

32:21.858 --> 32:23.515
(EXHALES)

32:23.525 --> 32:25.348
there were payoffs,

32:25.358 --> 32:27.264
there was...

32:27.274 --> 32:30.223
legal and semi-illegal intimidation...

32:30.233 --> 32:33.181
And do you personally
have plausible deniability?

32:33.191 --> 32:35.014
Yes, I think so. Yeah.

32:35.024 --> 32:36.556
Digital deep-clean,

32:36.566 --> 32:38.598
and I shredded the paper material.

32:38.608 --> 32:40.139
- Great.
- An outside team.

32:40.149 --> 32:42.473
And inside, signed
the paper out... Greg.

32:42.483 --> 32:43.807
- Greg.
- Yeah.

32:43.817 --> 32:45.515
Just thought family would be safest,

32:45.525 --> 32:47.056
and Greg's expendable. You know.

32:47.066 --> 32:49.848
What, you'd... kill Greg?

32:49.858 --> 32:51.973
No. But you know, he's family, right?

32:51.983 --> 32:54.358
- So we shut him up.
- Yeah, OK, right.

32:56.400 --> 32:58.765
What are you gonna do with this?

32:58.775 --> 33:01.056
'Cause if I give you the details,

33:01.066 --> 33:03.942
it could really hurt me, Shiv.

33:06.233 --> 33:09.191
You're not gonna let me get hurt?

33:11.233 --> 33:12.274
No.

33:14.900 --> 33:16.692
I'll need specifics.

33:18.608 --> 33:19.932
OK.

33:19.942 --> 33:21.400
So...

33:22.566 --> 33:23.566
So.

33:26.108 --> 33:28.775
(HELICOPTER APPROACHING)

34:03.733 --> 34:05.608
Keep him away from me.

34:09.858 --> 34:14.440
Your father's making a
subtle entrance... as I see.

34:18.817 --> 34:20.181
Hey.

34:20.190 --> 34:23.098
Come on. Forbidden fruit.

34:23.108 --> 34:24.306
Nate.

34:24.315 --> 34:26.931
Has the chicken laid the egg?

34:26.942 --> 34:29.358
Uh, no. Not yet. No joy.

34:34.525 --> 34:36.315
Look at you.

34:41.525 --> 34:43.473
I'm desperate to make you concentrate

34:43.483 --> 34:46.431
on nothing but me for just 15 minutes.

34:46.440 --> 34:48.858
You think I used to concentrate on you?

34:51.233 --> 34:52.358
Nate.

35:09.608 --> 35:12.348
So, Greg Egg.

35:12.358 --> 35:14.598
- Ah.
- How long do you give it?

35:14.608 --> 35:16.098
I'm sorry?

35:16.108 --> 35:18.807
The marriage. How long do you give it?

35:18.817 --> 35:20.556
Oh...

35:20.566 --> 35:23.431
Is there doubt afoot?

35:23.441 --> 35:27.056
I mean, I for one think
they look solid as a rock.

35:27.066 --> 35:29.900
But there you go,
I'm just an old romantic.

35:36.066 --> 35:37.191
Yeah, yeah!

35:41.608 --> 35:43.108
- Here we are.
- Thank you.

36:04.858 --> 36:06.900
- Hello.
- Hey.

36:08.692 --> 36:11.765
I'm feeling... much better.

36:11.775 --> 36:13.932
He's much improved.

36:13.942 --> 36:15.098
Great.

36:15.108 --> 36:17.181
Though you weren't actually invited.

36:17.191 --> 36:19.765
Maybe I can get them to make you
an omelet and find you a chair.

36:19.775 --> 36:23.807
I think usually the ones who
are paying get a chair, no?

36:23.817 --> 36:26.973
Oh. I didn't realize
you'd contributed, Marcia.

36:26.983 --> 36:28.942
So rude of me. Thank you.

36:31.650 --> 36:33.765
Let's get to the fuckin' room, shall we?

36:33.775 --> 36:36.181
How is the big man? Well, well, well.

36:36.191 --> 36:38.431
It's good to see you. You good?

36:38.441 --> 36:41.098
All good. Everything is
good, acquisition-wise.

36:41.108 --> 36:44.264
All we have to do is shut down the voice
of the fuckin' people over there.

36:44.274 --> 36:46.483
STEWY: Oh, there he is. (LAUGHS)

36:48.358 --> 36:49.608
(CHUCKLES)

36:54.775 --> 36:57.149
- Will you excuse me?
- Absolutely.

36:59.566 --> 37:01.483
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

37:09.483 --> 37:10.817
Kendall.

37:12.316 --> 37:13.775
KENDALL: Hey, Dad.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.348
So, what about it, son?

37:17.358 --> 37:20.348
You want to jump out of the
trenches and play a game of soccer?

37:20.358 --> 37:24.223
Can I bring you some corn
to get you through the winter?

37:24.233 --> 37:26.650
How ya doin'? What's the news?

37:28.191 --> 37:29.400
Oh, keepin' busy.

37:32.858 --> 37:36.640
You need a reference for your résumé?

37:36.650 --> 37:38.431
Relatively punctual.

37:38.441 --> 37:40.900
Prone to bouts of insubordination.

37:42.858 --> 37:44.358
Yeah, well, you know.

37:46.358 --> 37:49.098
So...

37:49.108 --> 37:52.723
how long are you gonna
fuck about on the outside?

37:52.733 --> 37:55.181
Uh-huh. You recruiting?

37:55.191 --> 37:59.400
What, new Head of Being
Continually Thwarted?

38:05.316 --> 38:08.139
How would a TV network suit you? Huh?

38:08.149 --> 38:11.640
One of the big guys when I land it.

38:11.650 --> 38:13.264
Could that work?

38:13.274 --> 38:16.306
You feelin' the heat on your own?

38:16.316 --> 38:17.598
Yeah? A little?

38:17.608 --> 38:20.056
You want me back? Like to...

38:20.066 --> 38:22.066
Like to put that in a press release?

38:25.066 --> 38:27.358
I'm just a lovely guy.

38:41.233 --> 38:42.973
Can you top me up, please?

38:42.983 --> 38:46.473
So? What was all that about, cocksucker?

38:46.483 --> 38:50.400
Oh, he was just telling me what
a sensational job you're doing.

38:52.400 --> 38:53.775
Fuck you.

38:55.024 --> 38:56.598
Did he mention the launch?

38:56.608 --> 38:59.056
Does he know that I've accelerated?

38:59.066 --> 39:00.348
(SHORT LAUGH)

39:00.358 --> 39:02.848
Say something fuckin' funny?

39:02.858 --> 39:05.014
- Hello.
- Oh.

39:05.024 --> 39:06.765
Caroline Collingwood.
Mother of the bride.

39:06.775 --> 39:08.181
Oh. Hi, I'm Stewy.

39:08.191 --> 39:10.306
So, how long do you give it?

39:10.316 --> 39:12.765
(LAUGHS) Uh, I'd say forever.

39:12.775 --> 39:16.556
Or until Shiv goes away for the
week, whichever comes first.

39:16.566 --> 39:17.723
Excuse me.

39:17.733 --> 39:19.973
You... beast.

39:19.983 --> 39:22.181
Hi. Mom. I hear you're asking

39:22.191 --> 39:23.431
"how long you give it."

39:23.441 --> 39:25.223
Just a cheeky icebreaker.

39:25.233 --> 39:27.098
OK, well, it's pretty fuckin' horrible.

39:27.108 --> 39:28.431
It's not all about you, Shiv.

39:28.441 --> 39:30.431
Other people need something to say.

39:30.441 --> 39:34.515
OK, well, can you ask them about
the price of fucking fish instead?

39:34.525 --> 39:36.556
I like your girlfriend, Ro.

39:36.566 --> 39:39.264
Oh, thank you. I met her at a sex party

39:39.274 --> 39:41.139
where she was giving the groom
a blowjob.

39:41.149 --> 39:42.598
(CAROLINE LAUGHS)

39:42.608 --> 39:45.765
- You should marry that one.
- Excuse me?

39:45.775 --> 39:47.973
And Shiv, stop taking
everything so seriously.

39:47.983 --> 39:49.807
I'm trying to sparkle.

39:49.817 --> 39:52.973
When people ask me how long
I give it, I say forever.

39:52.983 --> 39:55.098
- OK, well...
- It will be forever.

39:55.108 --> 39:57.316
- Well, thank you.
- Or it'll feel like forever.

39:59.441 --> 40:01.056
She says she's being impish.

40:01.066 --> 40:02.682
She's being a stone cold bitch.

40:02.692 --> 40:05.348
(CHUCKLES)

40:05.358 --> 40:08.264
Hey, you want to meet up
later tonight? All together?

40:08.274 --> 40:09.983
- At the place?
- Yeah.

40:12.108 --> 40:13.775
So, uh...

40:16.274 --> 40:17.723
you talked to the white whale?

40:17.733 --> 40:19.139
What'd he have to say?

40:19.149 --> 40:20.682
Nothing. I mean,

40:20.692 --> 40:22.431
he's just shoring up his position.

40:22.441 --> 40:24.515
It's not real. He's under pressure.

40:24.525 --> 40:27.181
Are you good? No wobbles, right? You OK?

40:27.191 --> 40:31.515
I'm not gonna get coldcocked here, am I?

40:31.525 --> 40:33.139
'Cause I heard from Frank

40:33.149 --> 40:35.405
the Canadians might
not be too keen on me.

40:35.416 --> 40:37.181
You talked to
the fucking grandfather clock?

40:37.191 --> 40:38.306
Has he signed anything?

40:38.316 --> 40:41.181
No, that would just be rude.

40:41.191 --> 40:43.264
I mean, he... he... he...

40:43.274 --> 40:44.848
he used to give me flying lessons

40:44.858 --> 40:46.223
in his fuckin' Cessna.

40:46.233 --> 40:47.515
Come on, man.

40:47.525 --> 40:49.431
You're not a little prince anymore.

40:49.441 --> 40:52.181
Don't rely on Sir Talky
of Fuckchester, please.

40:52.191 --> 40:53.598
He's good, Stewy.

40:53.608 --> 40:57.556
(CHATTER)

40:57.566 --> 41:00.390
GIL: Are we working upstate, or...

41:00.400 --> 41:03.848
Ah. Mr. Fuckhead, I presume.

41:03.858 --> 41:07.848
GIL: Logan Roy, Logan Roy, Logan Roy.

41:07.858 --> 41:09.682
Are we allowed to talk?

41:09.692 --> 41:13.723
I've nothing but admiration
for you personally, Mr. Roy.

41:13.733 --> 41:15.139
Oh, really?

41:15.149 --> 41:16.890
It's the sort of thing
you say, isn't it?

41:16.900 --> 41:19.390
Ooh. Classy.

41:19.400 --> 41:23.765
So, what is it you've got against me?

41:23.775 --> 41:25.515
You're the one making it personal.

41:25.525 --> 41:27.390
I'm just trying to do my job,

41:27.400 --> 41:29.223
think of everyone, not just myself.

41:29.233 --> 41:31.556
The interest of each is the good of all.

41:31.566 --> 41:32.855
That is the whole of the law.

41:32.866 --> 41:34.723
You don't need to remind me
of my Adam Smith.

41:34.733 --> 41:37.473
- I taught economics.
- Where? Kindergarten?

41:37.483 --> 41:40.390
What about "From each
according to his ability,

41:40.400 --> 41:41.890
to each according to his need"?

41:41.900 --> 41:44.139
What about, and this isn't me talking,

41:44.149 --> 41:46.682
but what about me, Mr. Fucking Ability,

41:46.692 --> 41:48.098
busting my chops

41:48.108 --> 41:49.348
in my auto shop

41:49.358 --> 41:52.765
so that some needy fuck
from the projects

41:52.775 --> 41:54.556
can jack off on my time?

41:54.566 --> 41:56.098
That's the issue, I'm afraid.

41:56.108 --> 41:58.807
Well, I find that a very
reductive view of human nature.

41:58.817 --> 42:00.431
I didn't make human nature,

42:00.441 --> 42:02.765
but I do know what they read
and what they watch.

42:02.775 --> 42:06.598
I make my nut off
what people really want.

42:06.608 --> 42:08.390
Don't tell me about people.

42:08.400 --> 42:11.400
I'd go flat broke in a week if I didn't.

42:15.191 --> 42:17.108
MARCIA: Nice to meet you, Senator.

42:19.650 --> 42:20.983
GIL: Yeah.

42:24.149 --> 42:26.348
SHIV: Sleep well, Dad.

42:26.358 --> 42:28.306
- MARCIA: Night.
- Thank you.

42:28.316 --> 42:31.473
Might be your last good one
for a decade or so.

42:31.483 --> 42:32.807
Hmm?

42:32.817 --> 42:35.807
The cruise situation.

42:35.817 --> 42:37.932
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

42:37.942 --> 42:39.139
Yeah, sure.

42:39.149 --> 42:40.973
Well, you might soon.

42:40.983 --> 42:42.274
Unless...

42:48.983 --> 42:52.848
You could afford to be
un peu plus agréable, Siobhan.

42:52.858 --> 42:54.723
You don't understand, Marcia.

42:54.733 --> 42:59.473
Well, I know when I see a spoiled slut.

42:59.483 --> 43:00.723
Excuse me?

43:00.733 --> 43:02.191
Tu m'entends.

43:03.566 --> 43:05.473
What the fuck? Who are you?

43:05.483 --> 43:07.848
Apart from a machine
for gathering power?

43:07.858 --> 43:11.181
You don't know how vulnerable
a human being can be.

43:11.191 --> 43:12.339
Oh, for fuck's sake.

43:12.350 --> 43:15.056
Have you ever had a fucking
grapefruit without an agenda?

43:15.066 --> 43:16.723
He made you a playground,

43:16.733 --> 43:18.682
and you think it's a whole world.

43:18.692 --> 43:20.932
Well, va te faire foutre.

43:20.942 --> 43:23.515
Go out and see how you like it.

43:23.525 --> 43:24.525
Fuck off.

43:32.358 --> 43:34.515
Well, you two seem to be
the best of friends.

43:34.525 --> 43:35.848
Don't.

43:35.858 --> 43:38.848
Aw, come on. It's OK.

43:38.858 --> 43:40.692
Hey. Pinky.

43:42.441 --> 43:44.233
Someone will be in touch.

43:47.066 --> 43:48.566
Great.

43:49.900 --> 43:51.765
Mmwahh.

43:51.775 --> 43:53.390
Hmm.

43:53.400 --> 43:56.431
You know, you're fuckin' great.

43:56.441 --> 43:58.264
Thank you!

43:58.274 --> 43:59.807
You're not a head fuck.

43:59.817 --> 44:02.035
Or a bitch or a leech.

44:02.046 --> 44:03.056
(SPITS)

44:03.066 --> 44:05.056
You say such pretty things.

44:05.066 --> 44:08.181
You never once asked to stay over...

44:08.191 --> 44:11.390
or how it works with my dad,
or the trust,

44:11.400 --> 44:15.056
or what my stake is, you know?

44:15.066 --> 44:18.108
I'm just pathologically incurious.

44:21.858 --> 44:24.024
What if I was prepared to marry you?

44:25.942 --> 44:27.515
Hello?

44:27.525 --> 44:30.098
- Hiya.
- (LAUGHS)

44:30.108 --> 44:31.598
- Right.
- What?

44:31.608 --> 44:33.640
Shiv's getting married,

44:33.650 --> 44:35.390
Kendall got married...

44:35.400 --> 44:38.181
I see. So, how about you
come down off of Mt. Olympus

44:38.191 --> 44:40.056
and propose to a mere mortal?

44:40.066 --> 44:41.598
Yeah, what if?

44:41.608 --> 44:43.932
- No.
- No?

44:43.942 --> 44:46.264
- Crazy.
- Why is this crazy?

44:46.274 --> 44:50.056
Because this isn't
a normal relationship.

44:50.066 --> 44:51.264
Why?

44:51.274 --> 44:54.765
Well, um, for one thing,

44:54.775 --> 44:56.765
we never fuck.

44:56.775 --> 44:58.515
Oh, yeah, we do.

44:58.525 --> 45:00.264
- No, we don't.
- Yeah, come on,

45:00.274 --> 45:02.306
yeah, we do,
we've been busy, that's all.

45:02.316 --> 45:06.598
No, you, like, kind of
jerked off near me, once.

45:06.608 --> 45:08.264
There's no need to be disgusting.

45:08.274 --> 45:10.973
To be honest, Roman,
I've had more sexual contact

45:10.983 --> 45:12.890
with the groom than I have with you.

45:12.900 --> 45:14.515
I asked you not to talk about that.

45:14.525 --> 45:16.209
I've slept with a lot of guys,
Roman Roy,

45:16.220 --> 45:18.223
and if that is gonna be a
problem, you better say.

45:18.233 --> 45:20.390
It's not gonna be a problem, it's Tom's.

45:20.400 --> 45:22.441
You want to get married or not?

45:25.858 --> 45:28.098
Babe.

45:28.108 --> 45:31.817
Do you think this is the way
to get someone to stay?

45:37.858 --> 45:40.765
SHIV: Hey-hey, Gerri.

45:40.775 --> 45:43.223
Thank you for meeting me here.

45:43.233 --> 45:44.390
Uh-huh. What is this?

45:44.400 --> 45:46.306
Uh, just a chat.

45:46.316 --> 45:48.181
Right. It's your wedding;

45:48.191 --> 45:50.223
why do I feel like
I'm about to get fucked?

45:50.233 --> 45:53.390
OK, it's late. Here's the situation.

45:53.400 --> 45:55.848
I know all about the cruise
division horror show.

45:55.858 --> 45:57.848
And the cover-up.

45:57.858 --> 45:59.348
And Gil wants to go to town on you,

45:59.358 --> 46:00.807
but maybe I can get him to hold off

46:00.817 --> 46:03.056
if ATN stops the personal stuff.

46:03.066 --> 46:04.098
Gil's wife.

46:04.108 --> 46:06.473
You want us to stop attacking him?

46:06.483 --> 46:08.598
Poor liddle fwagile
pwesidential candidate.

46:08.608 --> 46:11.682
No, keep attacking him
all through the primaries,

46:11.692 --> 46:13.682
fire up our base, and then just back off

46:13.692 --> 46:14.866
for the general.

46:14.877 --> 46:17.222
They're journalists, Shiv,
not remote-controlled little...

46:17.233 --> 46:19.682
Yeah, sure they are. I just
feel confident that, you know,

46:19.692 --> 46:23.181
a little public comment or two
from my dad, an email,

46:23.191 --> 46:25.306
and the minions realign pretty quick.

46:25.316 --> 46:27.014
(SHORT LAUGH)

46:27.024 --> 46:29.858
So you are, um...

46:29.983 --> 46:31.223
just to be clear...

46:31.233 --> 46:32.682
Oh, yeah. No, I'm bullying you.

46:32.692 --> 46:34.223
Yes. I'm blackmailing you.

46:34.233 --> 46:35.936
I'm threatening to destroy my father,

46:35.947 --> 46:38.308
- however you want to put it.
- And you're happy with that?

46:38.319 --> 46:40.890
Oh, come on, it is what it is.

46:40.900 --> 46:44.014
You used to be such a nice girl.

46:44.024 --> 46:46.139
- And Tom needs to be clean.
- Oh.

46:46.149 --> 46:49.473
Move him on, move him
up... maybe abroad.

46:49.483 --> 46:51.139
Clean hands.

46:51.149 --> 46:52.723
You're very pushy, missy.

46:52.733 --> 46:55.024
Thank you, fairy godmother.

46:56.692 --> 46:59.139
And if I was authorized to accept,

46:59.149 --> 47:01.932
can you get Mr. Smith
to fuck off back to Washington

47:01.942 --> 47:04.348
and not pull down his pants
to show off his amazing morals?

47:04.358 --> 47:07.056
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I can
persuade him that a dirty LBJ

47:07.066 --> 47:10.223
gets more done than a clean McGovern.

47:10.233 --> 47:12.807
(SIGHS)

47:12.817 --> 47:14.932
OK, well, good night.

47:14.942 --> 47:16.932
Hey.

47:16.942 --> 47:21.098
No marriage advice
from my dear old godmother?

47:21.108 --> 47:25.014
I don't know. I was never
very good at all that.

47:25.024 --> 47:26.890
My husband died.

47:26.900 --> 47:28.942
Don't let him die?

47:33.233 --> 47:35.973
OK, what is this? I was in the
middle of a conversation.

47:35.983 --> 47:38.848
Dude, I am super-sorry. Jess,
could you give us a second?

47:38.858 --> 47:40.223
No. Stew? Seriously.

47:40.233 --> 47:41.733
Ken, I got... I got Sandy on the line.

47:44.108 --> 47:45.566
Sandy?

47:47.566 --> 47:49.056
- Fuck.
- What is it?

47:49.067 --> 47:50.253
He can tell you.

47:50.264 --> 47:52.363
You can say, Stew.
What's with the theatrics?

47:52.374 --> 47:54.223
WOMAN (ON SPEAKERPHONE):
Can you hold for Mr. Furness?

47:54.233 --> 47:55.890
STEWY: He was just there. Where'd he go?

47:55.900 --> 47:58.139
You're not gonna say? Seriously?

47:58.149 --> 48:00.098
Is this the coldcock?

48:00.108 --> 48:02.014
I think it's just best that he tell you.
That's all.

48:02.024 --> 48:03.848
You're such a pussy.

48:03.858 --> 48:07.139
Is... Is it... Is this,
uh, Canadian shit?

48:07.149 --> 48:10.640
Um... it's about that bear hug letter.

48:10.650 --> 48:13.390
- Starting the takeover?
- OK.

48:13.400 --> 48:15.807
An acceleration.

48:15.817 --> 48:19.431
No, no, no. No, no, no. Fuck off.

48:19.441 --> 48:21.306
This weekend.

48:21.316 --> 48:23.473
- Hello, Sandy?
- At my sister's wedding?

48:23.483 --> 48:26.640
Are you insane?
What do you want this to be,

48:26.650 --> 48:28.515
One Wedding and Four Fuckin' Funerals?

48:28.525 --> 48:30.098
SANDY (ON SPEAKERPHONE): Hello?

48:30.108 --> 48:32.098
Hi. Yeah, he told me already.

48:32.108 --> 48:35.056
No, absolutely not,
no way, no. No! Fuck this!

48:35.066 --> 48:39.056
SANDY: Listen, but you
told Frank Vernon.

48:39.066 --> 48:41.264
I t... I...

48:41.274 --> 48:43.056
That has... I... I hinted.

48:43.066 --> 48:45.264
We've been contacted by a reporter,

48:45.274 --> 48:47.390
and they know something's cooking.

48:47.400 --> 48:50.640
We have to go tomorrow or risk a leak,

48:50.650 --> 48:52.525
which kills us.

48:53.692 --> 48:56.306
No. N... We're all together, OK?

48:56.316 --> 48:58.598
This is... This is not a good time.

48:58.608 --> 49:00.807
Well, it really is a good time.

49:00.817 --> 49:03.056
Your dad's out of the loop in the UK,

49:03.066 --> 49:04.483
we catch him off-guard.

49:07.233 --> 49:08.348
No.

49:08.358 --> 49:13.848
I... I need to, uh, you know, pr...

49:13.858 --> 49:15.431
p-p-p-prepare.

49:15.441 --> 49:17.056
Uh, I... I...

49:17.066 --> 49:19.056
Sandy, I need...

49:19.066 --> 49:20.264
prep time.

49:20.274 --> 49:22.056
OK? F-For the approach.

49:22.066 --> 49:25.723
You can't make an omelet
without breaking some dicks.

49:25.733 --> 49:27.890
Look, I'm sorry. OK?

49:27.900 --> 49:29.890
We'll be in touch with the letter,

49:29.900 --> 49:33.139
and let's close-coordinate
on the minute it's presented.

49:33.149 --> 49:36.306
OK? Thanks, kid.

49:36.316 --> 49:39.441
- (DISCONNECTS)
- Motherfucker.

49:50.483 --> 49:52.640
(ROMAN HUMMING)

49:52.650 --> 49:54.598
- Hey. How ya doin'?
- Hey.

49:54.608 --> 49:57.556
Where's Con?

49:57.566 --> 49:59.056
- KENDALL: Uh...
- Did...?

49:59.066 --> 50:02.264
- Con? Was he invited?
- Did you tell him?

50:02.274 --> 50:05.014
- Oh... Come on. What?
- Oh.

50:05.024 --> 50:06.973
You want me to get him? I told Willa.

50:06.983 --> 50:09.098
Uh... my...

50:09.108 --> 50:10.807
Fucking hell!

50:10.817 --> 50:12.608
Why did you get in the boat?

50:15.608 --> 50:17.390
No, I'm good. I got shit to do.

50:17.400 --> 50:19.431
What?! Why are we here?

50:19.441 --> 50:21.890
I thought this was for old times.

50:21.900 --> 50:23.973
- Uh...
- No?

50:23.983 --> 50:26.348
What about you, you wanna smoke my jay?

50:26.358 --> 50:29.515
KENDALL: No, I got shit to do too.
A lot cookin'.

50:29.525 --> 50:31.098
What the fuck! Really?

50:31.108 --> 50:33.014
All right, one hit.

50:33.024 --> 50:34.973
There we go, motherfucker.

50:34.983 --> 50:37.098
(ALL LAUGHING)

50:37.108 --> 50:38.264
Diss.

50:38.274 --> 50:40.608
- Intercepted.
- Old times.

50:43.650 --> 50:46.264
So listen, guys, um...

50:46.274 --> 50:48.890
I do have something I need to tell you.

50:48.900 --> 50:52.056
Um... I was at Mom's earlier,

50:52.066 --> 50:54.640
she had me going through
her papers and stuff,

50:54.650 --> 50:56.181
sortin' through some shit,

50:56.191 --> 50:59.932
and it turns out, uh, Shiv...

50:59.942 --> 51:02.264
you're adopted.

51:02.274 --> 51:05.682
And Ken? You're adopted.

51:05.692 --> 51:07.723
And Connor is obviously adopted.

51:07.733 --> 51:10.306
And so all that shit's comin' to me,

51:10.316 --> 51:11.765
so you can fuck off.

51:11.775 --> 51:14.515
I'm sorry, I don't know why
I asked you down here.

51:14.525 --> 51:15.848
ROMAN: No, it's good.

51:15.858 --> 51:18.149
Congratulations.

51:19.775 --> 51:20.983
I'm happy for you.

51:22.566 --> 51:24.515
I'm happy for you.

51:24.525 --> 51:25.733
Thanks.

51:29.650 --> 51:32.181
It's gotta not be so easy for you

51:32.191 --> 51:35.191
to be on the outside,
seeing me do big shit.

51:38.483 --> 51:39.598
Yeah.

51:39.608 --> 51:41.692
Big of you. Thank you.

51:43.274 --> 51:46.223
Yeah, well...

51:46.233 --> 51:49.692
uh... can I suggest a hug?

51:50.917 --> 51:52.890
- You serious? (LAUGHS)
- What is it... What?

51:52.900 --> 51:54.139
- Yeah. I'm serious.
- Why?

51:54.149 --> 51:56.056
Just... come on. Bring it in.

51:56.066 --> 51:58.765
- You know you want to.
- I'm goin' butt-first.

51:58.775 --> 52:01.473

- Here I come.

52:01.483 --> 52:03.723
- Here we all are!
- Ahh!

52:11.900 --> 52:13.723
I don't know, I mean, like,

52:13.733 --> 52:15.181
I think I owe it to him,

52:15.191 --> 52:17.515
but I don't want to be
the one to tell him.

52:17.525 --> 52:19.556
You know?

52:19.566 --> 52:22.900
I mean, like, what if he
finds out that I knew?

52:28.692 --> 52:31.390
Like... I either...

52:31.400 --> 52:35.056
I either owe it to tell him...
owe it to him to tell him,

52:35.066 --> 52:39.598
or I don't owe it to him
to totally t... not tell him.

52:39.608 --> 52:40.900
I think tell him.

52:42.358 --> 52:43.900
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

52:46.441 --> 52:48.181
Maybe don't?

52:48.191 --> 52:49.900
I don't fuckin' know.

53:10.108 --> 53:12.723
Well, no we can't do that
because that'll trigger

I... I, uh, didn't know...
(CLEARS THROAT)

54:18.149 --> 54:20.348
like, exactly how to tell you this,

54:20.358 --> 54:24.682
and I've been up all night trying
to think exactly how to...

54:24.692 --> 54:26.149
broach...

54:27.608 --> 54:29.848
So I want to just say that... that...

54:29.858 --> 54:32.348
I think that Shiv is, like...

54:32.358 --> 54:33.598
No. N...

54:33.608 --> 54:35.306
I think she's having an affair.

54:35.316 --> 54:37.723
No. You're wrong.

54:37.733 --> 54:39.682
No... No, I'm... I mean, not...

54:39.692 --> 54:41.431
Shut up, Greg. Shut up.

54:41.441 --> 54:43.348
Well, no, because I s... I...

54:43.358 --> 54:45.848
- You are. You're wrong.
- Maybe I'm wrong.

54:45.858 --> 54:47.807
You are wrong, so we're all good.

54:47.817 --> 54:49.890
- OK. G-Good.
- OK? So, good.

54:49.900 --> 54:51.264
Thank you for your time.

54:51.274 --> 54:53.306
Yeah. And you don't want to hear...

54:53.316 --> 54:55.556
I don't want to hear anything, Greg,
because it was a misunderstanding, OK?

54:55.566 --> 54:57.024
- I saw what I saw...
- Shut up.

54:57.035 --> 54:58.598
I just said shut up. Shut the fuck up.

54:58.608 --> 54:59.890
All right,
but I think you should know...

54:59.900 --> 55:02.056
No. Shut... Shut the fuck up, Greg.

55:02.066 --> 55:04.306
- I'm trying to help you.
- Shut up, will ya?

55:04.316 --> 55:06.139
- Fuckin' shut up.
- Dude! What the hell?!

55:06.149 --> 55:08.598

55:28.233 --> 55:31.348
I was quite outraged
when she suggested this.

55:31.358 --> 55:34.723
I don't like being outside the U.S.
for too long.

55:34.733 --> 55:36.098
Doesn't sit well.

55:36.108 --> 55:39.306
And there's a mercilessness I miss.

55:39.316 --> 55:41.348
I'm not used to
these squalid little deals.

55:41.358 --> 55:43.598
Yeah, living with the safety catch off,

55:43.608 --> 55:45.223
fuckin' without a rubber.

55:45.233 --> 55:47.431
Everywhere else feels so soft.

55:47.441 --> 55:49.942
I mean, look at this fuckin' place.

55:51.358 --> 55:54.306
Yeah, well, it...
it's all quite refined.

55:54.316 --> 55:56.598
LOGAN: Refined? Ahh.

55:56.608 --> 55:59.139
Slaves. Cotton and sugar.

55:59.149 --> 56:02.723
This country's nothing
but an off-shore laundry

56:02.733 --> 56:06.223
for turning evil into hard currency.

Is this where you tell me you're
working for the communists?

56:10.525 --> 56:12.181
And now it just lies here,

56:12.191 --> 56:14.431
living off its capital,
sucking in immigrants

56:14.441 --> 56:17.139
to turn it and stop it
getting bed sores.

56:17.149 --> 56:19.473
I was looking forward
to taking you down.

56:19.483 --> 56:21.483

want to get dirty, do we?

we don't want to get sued."

57:45.733 --> 57:48.223
(CHATTER)

57:48.233 --> 57:49.942
Thank you.

57:56.566 --> 57:58.223
(LAUGHS)

57:58.233 --> 58:00.348
Dad says, "Fuck the shareholders,"

58:00.358 --> 58:02.890
he calls analysts, calls hedge funds,

58:02.900 --> 58:04.515
tries to find a white knight,

58:04.525 --> 58:06.264
calls us, tells us to fuck off.

58:06.274 --> 58:09.473
He's a good man, Pinky.

58:09.483 --> 58:10.942
He's a good man.

58:20.900 --> 58:23.817
Price rockets, because everyone
knows we're gonna win.

58:31.775 --> 58:34.566
STEWY: You think there's a
chance he'll just do a deal?

58:36.733 --> 58:38.608
Have you met my dad?

58:40.775 --> 58:44.098
Nope. He'll never retreat.

58:44.108 --> 58:47.650
It'll be hostile, hostile, hostile.

58:48.669 --> 58:51.669
