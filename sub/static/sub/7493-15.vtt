WEBVTT

00:07.291 --> 00:09.291
You really think you can intimidate me?

00:09.667 --> 00:10.917
I'm not afraid of you.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.041
I'm about to be made sensei of this dojo.

00:15.208 --> 00:16.458
So, here's the deal.

00:17.583 --> 00:20.166
No more unicorn stickers
on the gym equipment.

00:22.041 --> 00:23.291
I like you, Jack.

00:23.375 --> 00:26.208
Don't even play your mind games, Lilly.

00:26.291 --> 00:27.792
I'm not gonna fall for it this time.

00:28.834 --> 00:30.709
You have pretty eyes.

00:34.750 --> 00:36.250
Take your stickers.

00:40.083 --> 00:42.667
All you, all you. Come on, push it, Jerry.

00:42.792 --> 00:44.458
- Whoo!
- Yeah! You did it.

00:44.917 --> 00:46.250
Whoo!

00:46.875 --> 00:48.291
Getting pumped, yo.

00:48.375 --> 00:49.959
Hey, you're the best spotter ever, Milton.

00:50.041 --> 00:51.792
Yeah, 'cause I'm a good motivator?

00:51.875 --> 00:53.667
Uh, no. It's because if I ever
needed your help

00:53.750 --> 00:55.625
you wouldn't be able to do a thing
and I would die.

00:56.959 --> 00:59.000
Which is really good motivation
if you think about it.

01:00.291 --> 01:02.750
Guys, guys, I have big, big news.

01:03.125 --> 01:04.166
You're gonna wanna sit.

01:05.959 --> 01:07.625
No, no, you're right,
it's too exciting to sit.

01:08.583 --> 01:12.208
A TV crew from black belt TV
is coming here next week.

01:12.291 --> 01:13.834
I love "Dojo Divas."

01:13.917 --> 01:16.375
A bunch of scene-stealing senseis
throwing hissy fits.

01:16.500 --> 01:17.875
You totally belong on that.

01:17.959 --> 01:20.959
I would never be on "Dojo Divas".

01:21.792 --> 01:23.333
After they rejected me.

01:24.375 --> 01:29.208
But black belt TV is coming here to shoot
"A Day in the Life of a Dojo."

01:29.291 --> 01:32.041
Camera's are going to capture
our every move, any questions?

01:32.291 --> 01:34.250
They're not going to follow us
into the bathroom, Jerry.

01:34.291 --> 01:35.250
Aww.

01:35.625 --> 01:38.291
But if they do, just remember
the restroom code of conduct.

01:38.959 --> 01:42.000
If you sprinkle when you tinkle
be a sweetie and wipe the seatie.

01:43.083 --> 01:45.208
Huh, I always forget that second part.

01:45.291 --> 01:46.458
We know!

01:47.417 --> 01:49.500
Look, the most important thing
with these documentaries

01:49.583 --> 01:50.875
is to just be yourself.

01:50.959 --> 01:52.750
One hundred percent natural.

01:52.834 --> 01:54.333
Hey, Rudy, what's under your jacket?

01:54.709 --> 01:56.834
Oh, these are my new fake abs.

01:59.458 --> 02:01.792
You think those plastic abs
are going to impress people?

02:01.875 --> 02:03.542
Uh, not by themselves.

02:04.166 --> 02:05.750
That's why I went butt shopping.

02:08.792 --> 02:10.667
What do you think? Should I go with...

02:11.000 --> 02:13.250
Gladiator or buff bullfighter?

02:15.458 --> 02:18.458
<i>♪ Don't you get all tough with me ♪</i>

02:18.542 --> 02:22.417
<i>♪ I'm saying won't you

02:22.500 --> 02:25.166

02:37.458 --> 02:40.583

02:40.667 --> 02:43.291

02:47.125 --> 02:50.083
<i>♪ It's not as cool

03:02.875 --> 03:05.417
If you join this academy,
I think you'll find that I am a...

03:05.834 --> 03:07.583
Truly gifted sensei.

03:08.917 --> 03:10.709
Now, normally I don't like
to toot my own horn

03:10.792 --> 03:13.709
but every once in a while
I do let a little toot slip out.

03:19.291 --> 03:21.625
Hey, Rudy, when did you
put up the suggestions box?

03:23.125 --> 03:24.750
Definitely not this morning.

03:26.208 --> 03:27.500
It's always been there.

03:27.583 --> 03:31.125
Because a truly gifted teacher learns
just as much from his students...

03:31.750 --> 03:33.000
as they do from him.

03:33.291 --> 03:34.834
I love hearing
what other people have to say.

03:35.291 --> 03:36.375
Let's take a look.

03:40.709 --> 03:41.625
Okay.

03:41.709 --> 03:42.959
Not gonna do that.

03:44.166 --> 03:45.583
This is a horrible idea.

03:46.917 --> 03:50.333
Okay, it is just physically impossible
for me to do that with my head.

03:56.834 --> 04:00.083
A great leader trusts his own instincts.

04:04.625 --> 04:06.291
Oh, look who's here.

04:06.875 --> 04:07.750
It's Jack.

04:07.834 --> 04:08.667
Hey, Rudy.

04:08.750 --> 04:11.333
You remember when you said I could take
my sensei test when I was ready?

04:12.375 --> 04:13.375
Mm-hmm.

04:13.458 --> 04:14.667
Well, I'm ready.

04:16.375 --> 04:17.834
What?

04:18.750 --> 04:20.625
That is so great.

04:22.625 --> 04:26.583
Oh, it is a proud day when your student
rises to the same level you are.

04:29.959 --> 04:32.542
Sensei Rudy with sensei Jack.

04:35.500 --> 04:38.000
Just two big, ol' senseis.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.500
Not one ahead of the other but, um...

04:44.333 --> 04:45.709
Equal.

04:46.542 --> 04:49.208
Sorry, we just don't have time
for your test right now, Jack.

04:49.333 --> 04:50.333
What?

04:50.417 --> 04:53.333
There is something much more important
that I need you to do.

04:53.792 --> 04:56.000
You want me to take over your
advanced black belt class?

04:56.083 --> 04:58.500
Nope, I need you to take this...

04:58.583 --> 05:01.041
and pick up the pizza that some
jerk dropped behind the radiator.

05:08.625 --> 05:11.417
I like to keep my pizza
on the radiator so it stays warm.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.542
It also works well with waffles.

05:25.834 --> 05:26.792
Gah!

05:27.250 --> 05:29.125
Jerry, you gelatined my locker.

05:29.709 --> 05:31.000
What makes you think it was me?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.583
Milton and I have
a very complicated relationship.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.542
You see, I prank him and he takes it.

05:39.792 --> 05:41.583
Actually, it's not that complicated.

05:43.375 --> 05:45.875
Oh, hey, it's 2:30. Watch this.

05:48.959 --> 05:52.166
Oh, no, that's mother's
2:30 check-in call.

05:54.291 --> 05:55.792
If he doesn't pick up after two rings,

05:55.875 --> 05:58.750
she activates his "Come Home Now"
tracker device.

06:03.834 --> 06:05.625
Hold on, mother, don't do it!

06:09.250 --> 06:10.417
Hello?

06:10.959 --> 06:11.875
Mother?

06:12.500 --> 06:13.542
Mother?

06:14.709 --> 06:16.750
Oh, good, she didn't do it.

06:19.083 --> 06:21.166
Mother, hold on, I'm coming!

06:34.250 --> 06:35.291
Hey, Rudy.

06:35.417 --> 06:36.417
Rudy, hey!

06:36.500 --> 06:38.542
Where you have you been?
I've been looking for you.

06:39.458 --> 06:40.458
And you found me.

06:41.959 --> 06:43.166
You are good.

06:44.542 --> 06:46.000
- Well, see you.
Wait, Rudy, uh...

06:46.709 --> 06:48.166
I'm ready to take my test now.

06:49.709 --> 06:50.709
Well...

06:51.834 --> 06:53.208
I...

06:53.792 --> 06:55.333
I...

06:59.041 --> 07:02.959
can't think of a single reason
not to give you your test.

07:03.458 --> 07:05.625
I literally couldn't think of one reason.

07:06.625 --> 07:08.083
So, the test is happening.

07:09.083 --> 07:10.041
I mean, don't get me wrong.

07:10.625 --> 07:12.250
I really want Jack to become a...

07:13.291 --> 07:15.041
sensei, just like me.

07:17.375 --> 07:18.709
It's gonna be great!

07:19.458 --> 07:22.083
All right, Jack,
let's start your sensei test...

07:23.375 --> 07:25.291
That I, your sensei,

07:26.041 --> 07:28.000
have personally designed for you,

07:28.500 --> 07:29.417
the student.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.041
Now, there's nothing to be nervous about.

07:31.125 --> 07:33.750
I've always trained you to believe
that anything is possible.

07:34.583 --> 07:36.750
- What's the first test called?
- "The Test of Impossibility".

07:38.458 --> 07:42.375
You must use a dragon spin kick to break
all three cinder blocks in one kick.

07:43.000 --> 07:43.792
Now,

07:43.875 --> 07:46.291
don't be intimidated by the fact
that no one has ever...

07:49.083 --> 07:51.041
Oh, well, I hope you're happy, Jack.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.291
Now, I have to rename the test!

08:00.291 --> 08:01.125
Hey, Milton,

08:01.208 --> 08:03.291
got you a leftover
piece of Lilly's birthday cake.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.375
Oh, thank you, that was really nice.

08:07.417 --> 08:08.709
Not falling for it.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.709
Whoa, Milton, relax.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.208
Look, I get it. You're my friend.

08:12.291 --> 08:13.792
It's not fair that I keep pranking you.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.500
Well, thank you, Jerry. I appreciate that.

08:19.083 --> 08:20.750
I'm gonna go take a shower and relax.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.875
- Oh, yeah, you got it, Milton.
-

08:22.959 --> 08:24.166
Enough is enough.

08:24.709 --> 08:26.750
Enough is never enough.

08:27.166 --> 08:29.166
I replaced Milton's shampoo with this.

08:29.875 --> 08:30.959
"Girly Curl."

08:32.083 --> 08:33.875
Instant curls for busy girls.

08:38.625 --> 08:39.750
Jerry!

08:41.750 --> 08:44.875
That's it. Your days of pranking me
are numbered, Martinez.

08:44.959 --> 08:48.875
Because I, Milton Krupnik,
am a man of pride and honor

08:48.959 --> 08:51.000
- and I will not be laughed at...
-

08:51.083 --> 08:52.166
Seriously?

08:52.667 --> 08:54.000
Are you laughing at me?

09:08.583 --> 09:11.250
Rudy, that's it.
I've done everything you've asked.

09:11.291 --> 09:12.709
I just did the salmon ladder,

09:12.792 --> 09:15.500
I sparred blindfolded
against every student in the dojo.

09:15.583 --> 09:18.709
I even went to your house and
deloused your mangy, bald bulldog.

09:19.166 --> 09:20.917
I don't have a dog. I live with my mother.

09:23.458 --> 09:25.458
Rudy, I deserve to be made sensei.

09:25.583 --> 09:27.000
I completed the final test.

09:27.083 --> 09:28.417
You're right, Jack.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.208
You did complete the final test...

09:30.291 --> 09:32.375
- Thank you.
- ...Of phase one.

09:33.208 --> 09:35.000
- What?
- The world's toughest sensei

09:35.083 --> 09:37.083
has to give
the-world's-toughest-sensei test.

09:37.583 --> 09:39.917
He has no intention of making me a sensei.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.583
This is classic Rudy.

09:41.667 --> 09:44.000
The cameras are on and he's
trying to show off his power,

09:44.041 --> 09:45.458
acting like a big man.

09:47.333 --> 09:49.375
I just wish there was a
way I could cut the big man

09:49.458 --> 09:51.792
down to... size.

09:59.458 --> 10:01.208
-
Oh!

10:02.542 --> 10:03.917
Grandmaster...

10:04.250 --> 10:07.083
the teacher who taught
me everything I know,

10:07.417 --> 10:09.208
who gave me all of my belts,

10:09.458 --> 10:12.542
and turned me into the amazing,
talented sensei that I am today.

10:12.667 --> 10:15.166
-
- What a most unexpected surprise.

10:15.250 --> 10:18.417
- Rudy, you called me and asked me to--
- Unexpected surprise!

10:19.709 --> 10:21.125
Why are there TV cameras here?

10:21.750 --> 10:23.667
Am I on "Dojo Divas"?

10:23.792 --> 10:25.709
- No. No, no, no. It's a...
-

10:25.750 --> 10:28.709
it's a TV show about life at our dojo

10:28.792 --> 10:31.583
and since you happened to
randomly show up,

10:31.667 --> 10:33.500
you can tell everyone about my greatness.

10:35.500 --> 10:39.208
Rudy, we should talk in private
about how you earned your black belt.

10:39.291 --> 10:41.083
Oh, no, no, I'm proud about that.

10:41.166 --> 10:42.750
We can talk about that right here.

10:43.542 --> 10:45.041
- Go ahead.
- All right.

10:45.709 --> 10:47.250
Rudy, I'm a fraud.

10:47.333 --> 10:48.709
You're not a black belt.

10:48.792 --> 10:50.667
Don't you think we should talk
about that in private?

10:50.750 --> 10:52.583
I won a black belt as a prize

10:52.667 --> 10:55.875
when I ate a four-pound wonton
at the Emperor's Feast.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.000
I started wearing the belt around.

10:59.583 --> 11:01.125
The chicks went wild.

11:01.917 --> 11:04.458
One thing led to another,
and I opened a dojo.

11:05.750 --> 11:07.625
Do you have any idea what this means?

11:07.709 --> 11:09.291
It means you're a white belt.

11:10.250 --> 11:12.625
And since Bobby wasabi gave me my belts...

11:13.250 --> 11:16.250
It means that I'm the highest
ranked member of this dojo.

11:17.792 --> 11:19.917
Looks like I'm in charge.

11:20.417 --> 11:21.709
But... I don't... Want you to be...

11:21.792 --> 11:24.166
Rudy, I'm gonna have
to take your black belt.

11:25.458 --> 11:26.417
No.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.083
No...

11:29.959 --> 11:32.834
When I found out Rudy invited
the grandmaster to make himself look good,

11:32.917 --> 11:35.750
it was the perfect opportunity
to bring down the big man.

11:36.792 --> 11:38.291
By going to the bigger man.

11:42.583 --> 11:44.709
You may have stripped me of my black belt,

11:45.250 --> 11:47.667
but you will never strip me of my dignity.

11:51.166 --> 11:52.792
Your stomach just fell off.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.000
I really am the grandmaster.

12:07.667 --> 12:09.166
But I wanted to get back at Rudy.

12:09.250 --> 12:10.417
Why?

12:10.500 --> 12:12.166
Because once, on April fool's day,

12:12.667 --> 12:14.291
Rudy brought me great shame.

12:14.834 --> 12:16.625
He tricked me with a whoopee cushion.

12:17.250 --> 12:19.792
When I sat down, it went like this...

12:23.041 --> 12:25.000
I didn't know you brought
the whoopee cushion with you.

12:25.417 --> 12:26.333
I didn't.

12:27.166 --> 12:28.041
Oh.

12:29.667 --> 12:32.166
- Oh! Oh!
-

12:33.375 --> 12:35.500
Hup! Hup! Hup!

12:36.041 --> 12:38.291
Hup! Hup! Hup!

12:38.709 --> 12:40.667
All right, good class.
Let's take a five.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.625
No, no, no. I can't do this.

12:42.709 --> 12:44.375
And I can't be a white belt.

12:44.458 --> 12:45.750
Do you know who wears white belts?

12:45.834 --> 12:46.750
Losers.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.208
Pathetic losers.

12:50.291 --> 12:51.792
No, no, not you guys. You guys are great.

12:53.333 --> 12:56.542
Look, Jack, as the highest-ranking
member of this dojo,

12:56.625 --> 12:58.333
you can give me back my black belt.

12:58.417 --> 13:01.125
Rudy, of course, I'm gonna help you
get your black belt.

13:02.375 --> 13:03.458
Eventually.

13:04.458 --> 13:06.417
Uh, Rudy, I gotta make a couple
quick phone calls.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.458
- Can you do me a favor?
- Sure, I can lead the class--

13:08.542 --> 13:10.208
Lilly, take over. Get back in line.

13:13.375 --> 13:15.875
Try to keep up, white belt.

13:24.750 --> 13:25.875
- Whoo-hoo!
-

13:26.834 --> 13:28.000
Did you see that?

13:28.500 --> 13:30.792
Thanks to those special amino shakes
you've been making me,

13:30.875 --> 13:34.125
I just lifted 315 pounds
like it was nothing.

13:35.625 --> 13:37.125
Because it was nothing.

13:37.208 --> 13:39.291
I've been replacing
some of his weights with these

13:39.375 --> 13:41.750
styrofoam ones to make him think
he's getting stronger.

13:41.834 --> 13:43.875
Only an idiot would fall for that.

13:43.959 --> 13:45.166
Oh, Milton.

13:45.250 --> 13:47.083
I had no idea you were so strong.

13:52.250 --> 13:53.542
Jerry, you just lifted more weight

13:53.625 --> 13:56.375
than last year's winner of the Mr. Seaford
Weight-lifting Contest.

13:57.166 --> 13:59.250
If you signed up,
you could totally win that thing.

14:02.291 --> 14:03.792
Then I'm gonna dominate.

14:04.709 --> 14:06.125
Gobble, gobble, Jerry.

14:06.208 --> 14:08.959
It's pranks-giving at the Krupnick house
and you're the...

14:12.291 --> 14:14.792
Oh, I'm known for my holiday bird calls.

14:14.875 --> 14:16.750
Hey, you wanna hear my Easter hen?

14:21.667 --> 14:26.125
We have a student who's shown exemplary
growth, and he's earned his rightful belt.

14:26.458 --> 14:27.458
Rudy Gillespie,

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
please step forward.

14:29.083 --> 14:31.375
Out of my way, losers!

14:36.208 --> 14:37.542
Thank you, sensei.

14:38.125 --> 14:40.500
I'm so happy to have my black belt back.

14:41.667 --> 14:42.625
Black belt?

14:43.041 --> 14:44.166
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

14:44.250 --> 14:45.125
That's just the cover.

14:48.500 --> 14:49.500
That's better.

14:50.291 --> 14:51.291
What?

14:51.417 --> 14:52.875
A yellow belt?

14:52.959 --> 14:54.375
You're giving me a yellow belt?

14:54.458 --> 14:56.333
You can't give him a yellow belt.

14:56.917 --> 14:59.417
- Thank you, Lilly.
- He's not as good as me.

15:02.875 --> 15:04.959
So, this is what it feels like
to be on top.

15:05.041 --> 15:07.333
-
- I'm looking for the man in charge.

15:07.542 --> 15:08.917
Uh, you're looking at him.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.083
What can I do for you?

15:10.166 --> 15:12.625
Name's David Basso,
I'm the assistant mall manager.

15:12.709 --> 15:15.417
Assistant <i>to</i> the mall manager.

15:16.250 --> 15:18.250
Well, yes, technically.

15:19.375 --> 15:22.083
Anyway, my boss needs you to sign
this new I-49

15:22.166 --> 15:23.542
Uh, your boss?

15:23.959 --> 15:27.000
Yes, the mall manager. Her name is Emily.
She's actually my wife.

15:27.083 --> 15:28.542
Ex-wife.

15:30.792 --> 15:34.000
Also, your license to operate
a business has expired.

15:34.083 --> 15:35.792
You'll need to talk
to Gary at city hall.

15:35.875 --> 15:37.166
Uh, I don't know Gary.

15:37.250 --> 15:38.959
Emily knows Gary.

15:41.667 --> 15:42.583
Okay.

15:44.875 --> 15:46.583
Uh, hello?

15:47.375 --> 15:48.917
Hi, Mrs. Krupnick.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.458
No, I don't know where Milton is.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.959
Yes, thank you. I already signed this one.

15:53.041 --> 15:56.250
I'm the plumber.
Whoever's in charge owes me $300.

15:56.333 --> 15:58.250
Wait, wait, wait, $300? For what?

15:58.333 --> 16:00.542
The little girl called me
after she flushed her Bobo,

16:00.625 --> 16:01.959
and the toilet started overflowing.

16:02.500 --> 16:03.625
Uh, what's a Bobo?

16:03.709 --> 16:05.750
- He's my panda.
- Oh...

16:06.417 --> 16:07.625
Ex-panda.

16:09.125 --> 16:11.125
- You know, I can shut off the water...
- Yes, hello?

16:11.208 --> 16:13.125
I told you, Mrs. Krupnick,
I don't know where he is.

16:14.709 --> 16:15.959
Please don't step on my desk.

16:17.875 --> 16:18.834
- Ow!
Be careful!

16:18.917 --> 16:20.709
Please stop calling!

16:22.250 --> 16:23.834
Hey, did you know our toilets
are overflowing?

16:24.709 --> 16:26.458
Do you know your mother's been
searching for you?

16:26.542 --> 16:28.166
Oh, no, she's looking for me? No, no!

16:29.709 --> 16:30.917
I want my Bobo!

16:31.041 --> 16:33.500
- Coming, I'm coming, mother!
I want to talk to your superior.

16:59.083 --> 17:01.125
All right, Jerry, you're up.

17:04.041 --> 17:05.709
Ah, starting you at 295?

17:06.166 --> 17:07.667
You won't even break a sweat.

17:20.166 --> 17:21.625
Oh!

17:22.291 --> 17:23.750
- Milton?

17:23.834 --> 17:25.291
- You have it!
- I don't have it.

17:25.375 --> 17:26.250
I don't have it!

17:34.458 --> 17:36.458
Nope, he didn't have it.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.542
I'm never pranking Milton again.

17:41.125 --> 17:42.458
He's a sick man!

17:46.417 --> 17:48.375
Sick, sick I tell you!

17:49.458 --> 17:51.333
It's amazing what you can do with glue.

17:51.834 --> 17:53.709
Yeah, do you know you can
even glue a person's hand

17:53.792 --> 17:55.375
to a camera without them noticing?

17:57.667 --> 17:59.917
Oh, yeah, you heard me.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.417
Who's laughing now?

18:07.333 --> 18:08.542
Goodbye, Lilly.

18:10.750 --> 18:11.875
Goodbye, Earl.

18:14.041 --> 18:15.125
And you...

18:15.792 --> 18:17.792
I think I'm gonna miss you
most of all, Ted.

18:18.083 --> 18:19.417
His name's Steven.

18:24.792 --> 18:26.000
Hey, wait, Rudy!

18:29.792 --> 18:30.959
I'm leaving, Jack.

18:31.375 --> 18:33.834
You can't go. I need your
help. I can't run this place.

18:34.542 --> 18:36.542
I'm just a yellow belt,
why would you need my help?

18:36.625 --> 18:39.000
- Technically, you're still a white belt.
- Not helping, Lilly.

18:41.583 --> 18:42.709
Look, Rudy.

18:42.792 --> 18:44.792
I was upset because you wouldn't
make me a sensei.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.750
So, I got the grandmaster to
come and pretend to be a fraud.

18:49.959 --> 18:50.834
But he's not.

18:51.250 --> 18:53.041
He's the real thing and so are you.

18:53.875 --> 18:55.083
I knew it.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.709
It's impossible to eat
a four-pound wonton.

18:59.500 --> 19:00.583
Rudy, what I did was wrong.

19:01.041 --> 19:03.041
I know you have your reasons
for not making me sensei.

19:05.291 --> 19:06.458
And whatever they are...

19:08.208 --> 19:09.208
I respect them.

19:15.250 --> 19:16.375
I do have my reasons.

19:18.083 --> 19:20.875
If I made Jack sensei, then he wouldn't
need me anymore.

19:21.291 --> 19:22.208
He'd, uh...

19:22.750 --> 19:24.250
He'd try to fly out of the nest.

19:25.375 --> 19:26.542
That's what baby birds do.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.166
They think they can dig up
their own worms.

19:29.625 --> 19:31.542
Well, I wanna be the
man to give Jack worms.

19:35.250 --> 19:36.583
Am I afraid I'll lose Jack?

19:37.625 --> 19:38.542
Sure.

19:39.291 --> 19:40.208
I mean...

19:42.083 --> 19:43.125
It's just that...

19:47.625 --> 19:48.625
You know what...

19:49.083 --> 19:50.709
I'm sorry, there's something I need to do.

20:14.458 --> 20:16.208
Sometimes you just have to be, uh...

20:17.583 --> 20:19.417
Strong enough to let the people
you care about...

20:20.667 --> 20:21.792
...grow.

20:28.625 --> 20:30.542
Oh, I feel like I'm about to cry but...

20:31.041 --> 20:32.291
then my makeup would run.

20:33.166 --> 20:35.792
I mean, if I was wearing makeup,
which I'm not.

20:39.750 --> 20:41.250
I'm sorry, we have to cut.

20:50.625 --> 20:51.917
Sorry about that.

20:52.041 --> 20:53.917
Had to take a quick phone call.

20:59.125 --> 21:00.834
Okay, where were we?

21:10.667 --> 21:12.542
All right, guys,
we had fun with the pranks

21:12.625 --> 21:14.000
but we're all done with them now.

21:16.083 --> 21:17.583
Except for one more.

21:21.083 --> 21:23.166
Rudy!

21:24.250 --> 21:25.667
Look at my hair!

21:26.792 --> 21:28.000
I love it.

21:57.000 --> 21:57.959
<i>Poor soul.</i>

22:02.000 --> 22:02.875
<i>Yes!</i>
