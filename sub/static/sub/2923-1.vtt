I equate films with sandcastles.

02:25.938 --> 02:28.691
You get a bunch of mates
and you go down and say,

02:28.983 --> 02:30.544
oh, let's build this great sandcastle.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.361
And you build it.

02:32.653 --> 02:37.783
And if the tide comes in in 20
minutes it's just smooth sand

02:38.075 --> 02:41.912
and that structure you made
is in everybody's memory

02:42.204 --> 02:43.204
and that's it.

03:23.746 --> 03:28.167
What does it mean?

03:28.459 --> 03:29.710
Fearless.

03:51.523 --> 03:52.775
I grew up in Kansas City.

03:53.651 --> 03:56.445
When I was 18 I became a ﬂier

03:56.737 --> 03:59.365
and I went overseas to the South Pacific.

04:03.327 --> 04:05.537
I started writing letters
and I wrote a letter

04:05.829 --> 04:11.210
to a cousin of mine who was a
woman who I didn't know really,

04:11.502 --> 04:15.756
but she was the secretary
to Myron Selznick.

04:16.048 --> 04:20.552
Who was one of the big agents,
David Selznick's brother.

04:20.844 --> 04:22.846
And I'd written her this kind of funny,

04:23.138 --> 04:26.392
cute letter and she wrote
me back and she said,

04:26.684 --> 04:29.520
oh, Bobby, you wrote such a nice letter

04:29.812 --> 04:31.981
you should be... you're a writer.

04:32.273 --> 04:35.317
And I thought, well, yeah,
that's what I'll do.

04:40.406 --> 04:44.618
When I got out of the air force
my dad was living in California.

04:44.910 --> 04:47.913
He rented a house in
Malibu, up in the hills.

04:48.205 --> 04:50.457
And so I move into my father's house.

04:53.002 --> 04:56.922
A guy named George W. George
had the downstairs apartment.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.091
I told him, I said, I'm a writer,

04:59.383 --> 05:01.427
and he said, oh I'm gonna be a director.

05:01.719 --> 05:02.999
We should do something together.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.975
So we wrote a story and we sold it to RKO.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.380
They wouldn't let me write the screenplay.

05:27.244 --> 05:30.456
I said well can I come and
watch the film being made?

05:30.748 --> 05:31.748
No.

05:31.749 --> 05:33.876
So I decided I'd be a playwright.

05:34.168 --> 05:35.419
I wrote a play.

05:35.711 --> 05:38.756
And I got in a car and I
was driving to New York

05:39.048 --> 05:43.177
and I stopped in Kansas
City, which is my hometown.

05:43.469 --> 05:49.808
And I ran in to a guy I had
known slightly in a bar

05:50.100 --> 05:51.560
and he said what are you doing?

05:51.852 --> 05:53.562
I said well I'm a film... film writer.

05:53.854 --> 05:57.399
I'm writing screenplays
and I lied quite a bit.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.735
I said I'm on my way to New York.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.403
I'm doing my [ﬂay-

06:01.695 --> 06:02.695
What are you doing?

06:02.738 --> 06:04.740
And he said I'm directing movies.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.283
I said where?

06:06.575 --> 06:09.095
He said well there's this place
here called the Calvin Company.

06:09.328 --> 06:11.121
It's an industrial film place.

06:11.830 --> 06:13.665
So I went over and I was introduced

06:13.957 --> 06:17.086
and lied about what I had done
some more and they hired me.

06:24.461 --> 06:25.461
Morning, Mr. Jones.

06:25.469 --> 06:25.928
Morning Charlie.

06:26.220 --> 06:27.721
You want me to fill 'er up today?

06:28.013 --> 06:30.516
Yeah, and one more thing,
I'm in kind of a hurry

06:30.808 --> 06:33.519
but I'd like to get an oil
change and a lube job.

06:37.314 --> 06:41.443
My film school was working
in this industrial films.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.446
I mean, I had to shoot, edit the films.

06:44.738 --> 06:45.823
I learned all the tools.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.077
When I was at the Calvin Company

06:50.369 --> 06:52.538
a guy who's father owned a bunch of...

06:52.830 --> 06:58.377
a chain of theatres in
the mid-west, in Roden,

06:58.669 --> 07:00.421
wanted to make a movie.

07:00.712 --> 07:05.300
And, uh, delinquents, a delinquents movie.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.512
And that's what it was
called "The Delinquents".

07:07.636 --> 07:10.597
So I wrote it in about three nights.

07:10.889 --> 07:14.143
I stayed up all night
and wrote this script.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.694
Golly, do we have to go in?

07:23.986 --> 07:25.946
Well let's just go in for a little while.

07:26.238 --> 07:28.449
If we don't like it we
can always leave, okay?

07:36.039 --> 07:41.211
We made it for $65,000 and
it was really terrible.

07:41.503 --> 07:42.546
Ah!

07:42.838 --> 07:43.838
Where you going?

07:44.006 --> 07:48.051
But Hitchcock saw that film,
he was impressed with it.

07:48.343 --> 07:52.222
So he called me in for a meeting

07:52.514 --> 07:54.975
and he offered me a "Hitchcock Presents".

07:56.185 --> 07:57.185
Hello.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.104
Mrs. Gould.

07:59.396 --> 08:00.063
This is...

08:00.355 --> 08:00.939
Hello.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.524
What do you think you're doing?

08:02.816 --> 08:05.277
I'm going to call her and
tell her we're in love

08:05.569 --> 08:07.070
and you're not going to stop me.

08:16.622 --> 08:17.622
Hello.

08:20.417 --> 08:21.417
Hello?

08:29.426 --> 08:31.178
Hello?

08:31.470 --> 08:32.971
What number are you calling?

08:33.263 --> 08:34.681
I did two of those.

08:34.972 --> 08:39.727
So then I got an agent and they
got me this job on Whirlybirds.

08:41.063 --> 08:43.357
Two boys robbed the store
and slit the owner.

08:43.649 --> 08:46.109
Could be the same ones
who killed the old man

08:46.401 --> 08:46.902
at the garage.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.194
Killed!

08:48.237 --> 08:49.279
Could you intercept? Over.

08:49.571 --> 08:50.739
We'll try, Greendale.

09:04.795 --> 09:06.880
We shot them in two and a half days.

09:07.172 --> 09:10.008
Every five days we would
shoot two episodes.

09:10.717 --> 09:14.388
Tommy Thomson, who was my AD,
would pick me up in the morning

09:14.680 --> 09:18.475
and I'd get in the car
and I'd drive out to...

09:18.767 --> 09:20.978
way out in the valley in California

09:21.270 --> 09:23.522
where we were shooting those things.

09:23.814 --> 09:26.984
I'd say what are we doing today?

09:27.276 --> 09:30.529
He'd say oh this is the thing,
and the two guys are doing this,

09:30.821 --> 09:34.533
and there's a woman who's
cheating on her husband

09:34.825 --> 09:38.453
and she's shot this guy, and
there's some baby chickens,

09:38.745 --> 09:40.956
and they have all these
eggs that are gonna die

09:41.248 --> 09:43.409
unless the helicopter gets
them and there's a dilemma.

09:43.542 --> 09:44.582
Do they take the chickens?

09:44.835 --> 09:45.835
Do they solve the murder?

09:46.086 --> 09:47.588
And I'd say okay, I got it.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.264
I was born and raised in California

09:57.556 --> 09:59.683
and spent a lot of time at the beach.

10:00.684 --> 10:04.354
One day a movie company put out a
call for girls who could swim.

10:04.855 --> 10:07.649
So I tried out and ended
up getting the part.

10:17.534 --> 10:18.535
I started getting work

10:18.827 --> 10:21.538
and one day I got a call to
play a nurse on Whirlybirds.

10:29.755 --> 10:31.590
The director was Robert Altman.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.259
He looked a little hung-over.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.095
When we were introduced
he didn't say hello,

10:37.387 --> 10:39.306
he just said how are your morals?

10:39.598 --> 10:42.976
And I said a little shaky, how are yours?

10:43.268 --> 10:44.311
That was the beginning.

10:47.689 --> 10:50.525
We went right into a fulltime relationship.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.195
I never worked again after Whirlybirds.

11:05.749 --> 11:07.110
He had already been married twice,

11:07.334 --> 11:09.795
but those marriages didn't last very long

11:10.087 --> 11:12.964
and he had three kids...
Christine, Michael, and Steven

11:13.256 --> 11:15.092
from those earlier marriages.

11:15.384 --> 11:16.718
And I had Konni from mine.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.930
When they got married we moved

11:20.222 --> 11:23.058
and my new school was having
this big father daughter dance

11:23.350 --> 11:26.478
and I was so new and completely terrified.

11:26.770 --> 11:29.231
Even though Bob and I didn't
know each other that well,

11:29.523 --> 11:31.692
he came with me as my father.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.194
He was so sweet about it.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.321
He just wanted me to be happy.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.661
Soon after we were married we had Bobby.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.543
We bought a house, it was a great house

11:49.835 --> 11:51.545
and we had lots and lots of parties.

11:52.796 --> 11:55.507
Bob loved to throw a party.

12:43.555 --> 12:46.975
I started in "Bonanza"
and "The Roaring 20's"

12:47.267 --> 12:49.436
and a lot of those series.

12:49.728 --> 12:52.689
And I became one of the
top television directors.

13:04.367 --> 13:05.660
The more television he did

13:05.952 --> 13:08.663
the more he realized all these
TV scripts he was given

13:08.955 --> 13:12.334
were just the same old
thing over, and over.

13:12.626 --> 13:15.921
<i>A'.</i>

13:16.213 --> 13:17.756
By the time he was doing "Combat"

13:18.048 --> 13:20.258
he tried to use his own
experience in the war

13:20.550 --> 13:22.260
to make the show more true to life.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.931
He did one episode where Vic
Morrow was shell-shocked,

13:26.223 --> 13:28.141
but that got him into trouble.

13:34.648 --> 13:35.899
Joey?

13:50.413 --> 13:52.833
Medic!

13:59.464 --> 14:03.385
That's my brother, my brother Joey.

14:03.677 --> 14:06.555
And he's, he's dead.

14:06.847 --> 14:08.682
It's all my fault.

14:08.974 --> 14:10.433
Geeze is this guy out of it.

14:10.725 --> 14:12.485
Walking down the road
carrying a dead German

14:12.727 --> 14:14.104
and thinking it's his brother.

14:14.813 --> 14:16.898
A man named Selig Seligman
produced that series

14:17.190 --> 14:18.650
and he forbade me to make that.

14:18.942 --> 14:20.902
He said I don't want you to do that.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.696
Then he went out of town and...

14:22.988 --> 14:24.614
and, uh,

14:24.906 --> 14:29.578
I didn't have a decent script
to go in with and so we did it.

14:29.870 --> 14:33.498
And when he saw it I was fired.

14:33.790 --> 14:37.127
And to edit the show the
editor would come...

14:37.419 --> 14:40.338
there was a bar there over there
on... on Washington Boulevard,

14:40.630 --> 14:41.840
over by MGM.

14:42.132 --> 14:43.633
I would go sit in the bar

14:43.925 --> 14:45.635
and Vic Morrow would go to the editor

14:45.927 --> 14:47.387
and then come and sit with me

14:47.679 --> 14:49.180
and he says here's what he's doing.

14:49.472 --> 14:52.475
I said well tell him do 'so
and so' and 'so and so'.

14:52.767 --> 14:55.604
Then Vic would go back and...

14:55.896 --> 14:58.148
And then that episode got
quite a bit of attention.

14:58.440 --> 14:59.649
I think it won an Emmy.

15:01.026 --> 15:02.506
He continued to push for more realism

15:02.611 --> 15:05.363
in all of his shows, but the
producers wouldn't go for it.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.784
In an episode of "Kraft Suspense Theater"

15:10.076 --> 15:13.580
he wanted to cast the black
actor as a convict on the run.

15:13.872 --> 15:16.958
And when the sponsor refused
the idea of a black character

15:17.250 --> 15:20.545
he quit television and
bad-mouthed the sponsor.

15:26.092 --> 15:29.429
I felt I had just done all
I could do in television,

15:30.430 --> 15:33.934
and I felt I'd better leave.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.062
What does Altmanesque mean?

15:39.064 --> 15:40.482
Playing the long shot.

15:51.660 --> 15:53.578
After burning his bridges in television,

15:53.870 --> 15:55.914
Bob wanted to write and
direct his own films.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.750
He thought that would give
him more creative freedom.

16:01.127 --> 16:04.339
Around that time we adopted
Matthew and our family grew.

16:07.050 --> 16:09.302
But we were running out of money.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.930
When you have six children
and can't pay the milkman,

16:12.222 --> 16:13.222
that's pretty bad.

16:21.982 --> 16:25.276
It was our fifth anniversary and
he told me for our anniversary

16:25.568 --> 16:27.612
we're flying to Las Vegas for the weekend,

16:27.904 --> 16:28.904
so get ready.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.782
I'm just going to run out to the racetrack

16:31.074 --> 16:33.201
and I'll meet you at the airport at six.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.788
Later, I found out he had
our last $200 in his pocket

16:37.080 --> 16:40.125
and he'd bet it all on a
twenty-to-one long shot

16:40.417 --> 16:41.417
and he won.

16:42.836 --> 16:45.839
When we landed in Las Vegas he
went directly to the craps table

16:46.131 --> 16:47.966
and won another $6000.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.680
But if it had gone the other way

16:53.972 --> 16:56.224
I might not be here to tell you this story.

17:03.356 --> 17:06.317
My first film I did after
years of television

17:06.608 --> 17:08.903
was a thing called "Countdown"
with Warner Brothers.

17:09.194 --> 17:12.365
They sent it to me and I liked the story.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.951
It was about going to the moon,

17:15.410 --> 17:17.537
but Jack Warner was very
reluctant to hire me.

17:17.829 --> 17:20.165
He thought I was a bit of a smartass.

17:20.457 --> 17:21.457
He told me so.

17:21.665 --> 17:24.419
I went up to his office and
sat there and he said listen,

17:24.711 --> 17:26.391
everybody wants to put you on this picture

17:26.671 --> 17:28.923
so I told them they can do what they want,

17:29.215 --> 17:30.967
but I gotta tell you, you're gonna fail.

17:31.259 --> 17:34.220
He says I don't like your work,
I don't think you get it

17:34.512 --> 17:37.557
and I don't think you'll
do a good job on this.

17:37.849 --> 17:41.019
But I'm going to let you do it and so.

17:41.311 --> 17:43.855
I said well I hope I can prove you wrong.

17:44.147 --> 17:50.570
Five, four, three, two, one, fire.

18:07.378 --> 18:10.256
Lee, this is Chiz, do you read?

18:11.591 --> 18:13.968
What's the story?

18:14.260 --> 18:16.429
You'll be awhile.

18:16.721 --> 18:21.226
Now listen, we believe that...
some arc... at the launch.

18:21.518 --> 18:22.977
Repeat.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.230
At the launch there was some arching

18:25.522 --> 18:27.107
and you're losing electrical power.

18:27.982 --> 18:31.319
There's no way to repair without
a risk of the retros firing

18:31.611 --> 18:33.613
and sending you out of trajectory.

18:33.905 --> 18:35.365
You'd never get back.

18:35.657 --> 18:36.657
What?

18:39.536 --> 18:41.246
Jack Warner was out of town

18:41.538 --> 18:44.249
and the last day of shooting he came back

18:44.541 --> 18:46.626
and the phone rang and it was Bill Conrad.

18:46.918 --> 18:52.882
It was the producer of this
little movie and he said listen,

18:53.174 --> 18:56.177
don't come in Monday because Jack...

18:56.469 --> 18:58.096
They won't let you in the studio.

18:58.388 --> 19:02.976
Jack Warner called for your
dailies and he ran them,

19:03.268 --> 19:04.268
uh...

19:04.435 --> 19:08.439
Sunday and he's barred you from the lot.

19:10.984 --> 19:14.070
And I said what do you mean
he's barred me from the lot?

19:14.362 --> 19:15.443
I have the Directors Guild.

19:15.697 --> 19:17.282
I get my first cut.

19:17.574 --> 19:20.285
He says you can do any of
that legal stuff you want

19:20.577 --> 19:23.830
and they'll let you do it, if
that's what you want to do.

19:24.122 --> 19:26.291
But nobody's going to look at what you do

19:26.583 --> 19:29.002
and it's all going to be changed.

19:30.170 --> 19:33.756
He said, if you want to hear
what he said that fool,

19:34.048 --> 19:36.384
meaning me, has actors
talking at the same time.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.179
Two days more and we could
of had an unbeatable edge.

19:39.470 --> 19:40.054
I know...

19:40.346 --> 19:41.431
Those men should of been brought in...

19:41.723 --> 19:43.975
I couldn't bring them all
in, they don't trust me.

19:48.271 --> 19:49.981
Mr. Nogritty's calling from Washington.

19:50.273 --> 19:53.067
I was just trying to get
the illusion of reality

19:53.359 --> 19:55.612
and so I got fired from that

19:55.904 --> 19:58.823
because of the overlapping dialogue.

20:05.205 --> 20:08.708
Making your own rules.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.548
Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau

20:15.840 --> 20:17.201
speaking with church leaders today

20:17.383 --> 20:20.011
said U.S. Conscientious
Objectors to the war in Vietnam

20:20.303 --> 20:21.804
have his complete sympathy

20:22.096 --> 20:24.096
and that Canada should be
a refuge for militarism.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.653
Somehow Bob found backing
for an independent film

20:36.945 --> 20:39.656
to be shot in Canada, "That
Cold Day in the Park".

20:39.948 --> 20:40.948
Action.

20:41.199 --> 20:43.326
He loved Canada and talked
about moving there.

20:43.618 --> 20:46.329
He was mad at America
because of the Vietnam War.

20:46.955 --> 20:47.955
Cut. Print that.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.540
So I get the documents together

20:49.832 --> 20:51.334
and was trying to sell the house,

20:51.626 --> 20:53.336
but then lngo came into the picture.

20:56.422 --> 20:57.743
Lngo Preminger was a talent agent

20:58.007 --> 20:59.884
that had a script he wanted to produce.

21:00.176 --> 21:01.970
Lngo thought Bob would be perfect for it

21:02.262 --> 21:05.807
after he saw a short film that
Bob had made about smoking pot.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.718
Everyone in town had turned it down,

21:42.010 --> 21:44.679
but Bob saw something in that
script that noone else saw.

21:47.515 --> 21:49.559
I talked to lngo Preminger for two hours

21:49.851 --> 21:53.062
and I said if you want to make
the picture I want to make,

21:53.354 --> 21:54.022
I'll do it.

21:54.314 --> 21:55.857
Here's what I want. Here's what I see.

21:56.149 --> 21:58.276
And he said okay, let's go.

22:25.595 --> 22:28.973
Fox did not want it to be a Vietnam thing.

22:29.265 --> 22:31.017
The war was still going on in Vietnam.

22:31.476 --> 22:34.145
So they did not want to,

22:34.437 --> 22:37.523
the studio did not want to come
out with that kind of picture.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.741
I don't think I would of
gotten away with this,

22:47.033 --> 22:51.579
except Fox at the time had two
other war films going on.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.582
So they were concerned about
those and I was aware of that

22:54.874 --> 22:59.587
and I said I've got to
go on the back lot there

22:59.879 --> 23:03.758
and keep a low profile
and not draw attention.

23:04.050 --> 23:06.094
Let nobody pay attention to me.

23:06.761 --> 23:08.471
Elliott Gould.

23:08.763 --> 23:09.763
How do you do?

23:09.806 --> 23:11.808
This is???? who is the cameraman.

23:12.100 --> 23:12.725
How are you?

23:13.017 --> 23:14.769
You'll be playing what, Hawkeye?

23:15.061 --> 23:16.646
We were a little minor film.

23:16.938 --> 23:18.481
We didn't have any stars in it.

23:19.857 --> 23:21.609
I went up to San Francisco.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.403
There was a theater company up there,

23:23.694 --> 23:25.822
one of those improvisational companies

23:26.114 --> 23:29.534
and I hired most of them
as incidental players.

23:32.863 --> 23:33.863
Radar!

23:33.871 --> 23:34.497
Yes sir.

23:34.789 --> 23:36.350
Why don't you get ahold of Major Burns?

23:36.457 --> 23:39.168
Tell him we're going to have
to hold a couple of surgeons

23:39.460 --> 23:41.212
from the day shift onto the night shift.

23:41.504 --> 23:44.424
To the surgeons,

23:44.715 --> 23:46.384
we're sure gonna need them.

23:48.511 --> 23:53.307
It was taking an ensemble cast
and doing it in a humorous way.

23:54.142 --> 23:55.822
I think you will find these accommodating,

23:56.060 --> 23:57.060
they're quite dry.

23:57.186 --> 23:58.186
Don't you use olives?

23:58.271 --> 24:00.481
Olives? Where the hell do
you think you are, man?

24:00.773 --> 24:02.893
Dear God, protect our Supreme
Commander on the field.

24:03.067 --> 24:05.069
Frank, were you on the
religious kick at home

24:05.361 --> 24:06.863
or did you crack up over here?

24:07.155 --> 24:08.865
I'm married, I'm happy, I love my wife.

24:09.157 --> 24:11.159
If she was here I would be with her,

24:11.451 --> 24:12.451
there is no question.

24:12.452 --> 24:14.203
I wonder how a degenerated person like that

24:14.495 --> 24:15.955
could have reached a
position of responsibility

24:16.247 --> 24:17.665
in the army medical core.

24:17.957 --> 24:18.957
He was drafted.

24:21.210 --> 24:24.380
We had a script which
we used as a blueprint,

24:24.672 --> 24:26.632
and as we would rehearse it would evolve.

24:27.467 --> 24:29.844
If something occurred to
us that seemed to work,

24:30.136 --> 24:31.136
we would do it.

24:31.345 --> 24:33.586
Now when German starts coming
over here like he's hurt...

24:33.806 --> 24:35.516
hey Scotty when he gets over to you,

24:35.808 --> 24:38.060
we'll give you a spot and
you're going to say,

24:38.352 --> 24:40.855
"For god sakes Gorman, this
is... get back in the game".

24:41.147 --> 24:42.523
He says, "I've got the ball".

24:42.815 --> 24:45.860
And then you say, "you've
got the ball, well run".

24:46.152 --> 24:48.905
And then you say, "you've got
the ball, he's got the ball"!

24:53.784 --> 24:54.784
<i>Go, gm.!</i>

24:54.827 --> 24:56.787
What's the matter with you?
Get back in the game!

24:56.954 --> 24:57.954
I've got the ball!

24:57.997 --> 24:59.290
You've got the ball, well run!

24:59.582 --> 25:01.167
Run! Run!

25:06.797 --> 25:08.591
We were working for the laughs

25:08.883 --> 25:10.676
and yet there was a reality to it.

25:11.511 --> 25:12.762
People died.

25:17.099 --> 25:18.684
Scorch, I need some more sponge clamps,

25:18.976 --> 25:20.520
if you have them.

25:20.811 --> 25:22.772
Give me some big hunks
of sponge or something.

25:23.064 --> 25:24.273
We're all out of big sponges.

25:24.565 --> 25:26.067
You'll have to use these for now.

25:26.359 --> 25:28.819
Oh that's bleeding nice, oh,
that can't come out of there.

25:29.111 --> 25:30.571
I can't stop that bleeding.

25:31.948 --> 25:32.948
I can't really see,

25:33.115 --> 25:34.835
It's like the Mississippi River down there.

25:37.954 --> 25:38.954
Ready?

25:39.121 --> 25:40.121
I'm ready.

25:41.082 --> 25:42.583
Nurse, you got a clamp, please?

25:42.875 --> 25:43.875
Yes, yes sir.

25:46.587 --> 25:48.089
Scratch my nose.

25:48.548 --> 25:49.799
Just on... there.

25:50.091 --> 25:51.676
There, a little harder please.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.446
Scorch, I need some more sponge clamps,

25:54.720 --> 25:55.720
if you have them.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.394
Darryl Zanuck, who was the head of Fox,

26:01.686 --> 26:04.063
was in Europe while this was being made.

26:04.647 --> 26:10.027
He came back and we had a screening for him

26:10.319 --> 26:12.613
and within this screening he
had come back from Europe

26:12.905 --> 26:18.953
and he had two young European
girls that were friends of his.

26:19.870 --> 26:24.000
And he... They came to the screening

26:24.292 --> 26:26.502
and at the end of the screening

26:26.794 --> 26:30.006
he said all that blood has to come out.

26:32.216 --> 26:34.468
And I thought, oh, Christ, we're sunk.

26:34.760 --> 26:38.848
And those girls said, oh Darryl,
that's the best part of it.

26:39.473 --> 26:43.519
And they just supported that in such a way

26:43.811 --> 26:48.232
that we were allowed to leave
them in for a preview.

26:48.524 --> 26:50.860
And that audience went nuts.

26:51.527 --> 26:53.904
And Zanuck said we're not
going to mess with this.

27:02.705 --> 27:05.958
The picture was such a
hit it was phenomenal.

27:07.043 --> 27:09.128
I mean, you know, with the war going on,

27:09.420 --> 27:10.463
the timing worked.

27:55.257 --> 28:02.014
Um, life, liberty, and
the pursuit of truth.

28:05.726 --> 28:08.229
Now, we welcome the fifteenth
man asked to direct MASH,

28:08.521 --> 28:09.855
Mr. Robert Altman.

28:22.410 --> 28:23.411
My son wrote that song.

28:23.703 --> 28:24.704
Your son wrote that song?

28:24.995 --> 28:27.540
When he was fourteen, Suicide is Painless.

28:27.832 --> 28:29.166
Now he's got too much money.

28:29.458 --> 28:33.337
He's sixteen, living with a 20
year old girl in Venice and...

28:33.629 --> 28:34.255
Shocking.

28:34.547 --> 28:36.465
Do you get any kick now out of the fact

28:36.757 --> 28:38.634
that you're a hot director

28:38.926 --> 28:41.303
and there's all those years
that people wouldn't...

28:41.595 --> 28:42.888
wouldn't expectorate on you?

28:43.180 --> 28:44.223
Oh yeah.

28:44.515 --> 28:44.932
Yeah.

28:45.224 --> 28:46.225
How does it come out?

28:46.517 --> 28:46.934
It's fun.

28:47.226 --> 28:47.727
Yeah.

28:48.018 --> 28:49.018
It's nice.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.254
Bob became the hottest
director in Hollywood

29:15.546 --> 29:19.800
and we built what I called our
movie star house in Malibu.

29:20.092 --> 29:24.221
It was a new life for our family.

29:24.513 --> 29:26.599
Everyone wanted Bob to do "MASH 2",

29:26.891 --> 29:28.976
but Bob refused to repeat himself.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.979
Instead he surprised everyone
by making a far out little film

29:32.271 --> 29:33.439
called "Brewster McCloud".

29:36.442 --> 29:38.944
It was an important time in the 70's

29:39.236 --> 29:43.199
because this studio turned
filmmaking back to the artist

29:43.491 --> 29:45.868
so I go to do a lot of stuff

29:46.160 --> 29:48.037
that was certainly not the formula

29:48.329 --> 29:49.538
that had existed before.

30:01.258 --> 30:05.304
The McCabe script was given to
me right after I made "MASH".

30:05.596 --> 30:09.391
The reason I like it was it was
the standard western genre.

30:10.100 --> 30:11.811
We just twisted it a little bit.

30:33.791 --> 30:34.792
McCabe and Mrs. Miller

30:35.084 --> 30:37.378
is a beautiful pipe dream of a movie.

30:37.670 --> 30:39.547
A ﬂeeting, almost diaphanous vision

30:39.839 --> 30:42.049
of what frontier life might of been like.

30:43.676 --> 30:45.302
It's not much like other westerns.

30:45.594 --> 30:47.721
It's not really much like other movies.

30:49.723 --> 30:52.601
The fact is that Altman is
dumping square conventions

30:52.893 --> 30:54.186
that don't work anymore.

30:54.979 --> 30:58.274
All those threadbare remnants
of the well-made play,

30:58.566 --> 31:00.442
which American movies have clung to.

31:02.653 --> 31:06.448
What this movie reveals is that
there's poetry in Robert Altman,

31:06.740 --> 31:08.826
and he's able to put it on the screen.

31:12.162 --> 31:13.581
The question is always asked...

31:13.873 --> 31:16.542
why aren't there American
Bergmans and Fellinis?

31:17.668 --> 31:20.713
Here is an American artist who
has made a beautiful film.

31:32.433 --> 31:33.475
We were in Canada.

31:33.767 --> 31:34.768
We went to Ireland.

31:35.060 --> 31:38.022
Bob liked to shoot as far away
from the studios as possible

31:38.314 --> 31:40.595
so he wouldn't have executives
looking over his shoulder.

31:42.067 --> 31:43.110
Yeah?

31:43.402 --> 31:46.196
I just stopped here because it's
a good wide place in the road

31:46.488 --> 31:48.032
and I figured we can rendezvous here.

31:48.324 --> 31:51.952
Also it looks like there's
bad weather over there.

31:52.244 --> 31:53.829
I think we gotta go some place.

31:54.121 --> 31:54.830
Well either direction here,

31:55.122 --> 31:57.291
I thought while they're mounting the car

31:57.583 --> 31:59.543
I'll drive up this way, drive up that way,

31:59.835 --> 32:01.086
see where the weather is worse.

32:01.378 --> 32:04.840
I got out of that damn car so
they could get it up the hill

32:05.132 --> 32:07.468
and I said I would walk.

32:07.760 --> 32:10.971
And they took it, so I ran
up that fucking hill.

32:15.351 --> 32:16.810
You remember last night?

32:19.438 --> 32:20.773
Now the kiss again.

32:21.065 --> 32:24.401
That's when... just as long as
you do and lean right into it,

32:24.693 --> 32:25.861
and that's when you respond,

32:26.153 --> 32:27.738
'cause now you're going to trick him.

32:28.822 --> 32:29.822
Yeah, that's it.

32:30.032 --> 32:31.033
Stand by.

32:31.325 --> 32:32.325
Slate.

32:33.243 --> 32:34.870
Hello, is your name Mrs. Altman?

32:35.788 --> 32:36.788
Yes it is.

32:37.039 --> 32:40.918
Oh, well I'd like to ask you a
few questions about filming.

32:41.627 --> 32:46.006
Um, how did you meet your husband?

32:46.715 --> 32:49.093
I met him in Hollywood
on a television series

32:49.385 --> 32:50.427
called Whirlybirds.

32:50.719 --> 32:51.719
Oh.

32:51.929 --> 32:53.430
He was directing it at the time.

32:53.722 --> 32:58.394
And, uh, oh...

32:59.687 --> 33:02.898
How do you like being
married to a film director?

33:03.190 --> 33:04.590
Oh, find it very, very interesting.

33:04.900 --> 33:08.112
Very unusual life and very
full of surprises day-by-day.

33:08.904 --> 33:12.574
Yeah, and also I hear that
your children are making...

33:12.866 --> 33:14.187
they're starting to like filming.

33:14.535 --> 33:15.619
Yeah, they're getting very involved.

33:15.911 --> 33:17.955
I may end up with four
little boy directors.

33:18.956 --> 33:19.956
Action.

34:08.047 --> 34:11.341
Bob was constantly innovating,
and in the 1970's

34:11.632 --> 34:14.261
he developed a casual style
that was radically different

34:14.553 --> 34:16.346
from Hollywood filmmaking at the time.

34:30.194 --> 34:32.154
Mr. Marlowe the lights on your car are on.

34:32.446 --> 34:34.907
Oh yeah, thanks a lot.

34:35.199 --> 34:37.409
Excuse me I don't see any
Coury Brant cat food.

34:37.701 --> 34:38.701
Some what?

34:38.702 --> 34:40.661
Coury Brant cat food, it
happens to be the only...

34:40.704 --> 34:42.206
Can you spell it for me please?

34:42.498 --> 34:44.917
Yeah, Coury Brant, c-0-u-r...
Oh, we're all out.

34:45.208 --> 34:48.212
Why don't you get this, Mr. All
this shit is the same anyway.

34:48.504 --> 34:51.215
You don't happen to have a
cat by any chance, do you?

34:51.507 --> 34:54.051
What do I need a cat for? I got a girl.

34:54.342 --> 34:54.967
Well...

34:55.260 --> 34:56.260
haha.

34:59.723 --> 35:02.017
On 'The Long Goodbye' the
camera never stopped moving.

35:02.684 --> 35:04.436
Dollying, zooming.

35:04.728 --> 35:07.231
He wanted the action to be
caught as if by accident.

35:07.898 --> 35:10.109
He hated things being mastered, two-shot,

35:10.400 --> 35:12.027
hit your mark, say your line.

35:12.903 --> 35:16.281
He wanted the feeling to be
natural and more relaxed,

35:16.573 --> 35:17.573
observational.

35:20.536 --> 35:21.536
Okay, Eileen,

35:21.703 --> 35:23.080
what was Marty Augustine
doing here the other night?

35:23.372 --> 35:24.372
How did you know?

35:24.373 --> 35:25.874
I followed him here from my place.

35:26.166 --> 35:28.627
He dropped by to have a word or two with me

35:28.919 --> 35:32.131
and I was just curious to see
who else he wanted to talk to.

35:32.422 --> 35:34.758
Oh, Roger owed him some money.
Maybe $10,000 or something.

35:35.050 --> 35:36.176
He owes Marty?

35:36.468 --> 35:38.595
You know what he told me Marty owed him.

35:38.887 --> 35:40.430
We all heard what Dr. Verringer said.

35:40.722 --> 35:42.057
He hates to part with money.

35:42.349 --> 35:43.549
Yeah, what Dr. Verringer said.

35:43.600 --> 35:45.853
I heard a lot of people
said that Terry Lennox

35:46.145 --> 35:47.521
was working for Marty Augustine.

35:47.813 --> 35:48.813
I don't believe it.

35:49.022 --> 35:50.691
Yeah, well, that's what I heard.

35:50.983 --> 35:52.663
Your husband ever talk about the Lennox's?

35:52.734 --> 35:53.193
No.

35:53.485 --> 35:54.806
He ever talk about Sylvia Lennox.

35:54.903 --> 35:55.903
No.

35:55.988 --> 35:58.448
Is your husband having an
affair with Sylvia Lennox?

35:58.740 --> 35:59.741
Mr. Marlowe,

36:00.033 --> 36:01.535
I don't wish to continue this
conversation about my husband.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.148
Was your husband having an affair

36:03.328 --> 36:04.449
with somebody you don't know

36:04.621 --> 36:06.415
who just might of been Sylvia Lennox?

36:06.707 --> 36:07.791
Definitely not.

36:08.083 --> 36:10.403
Where was your husband the night
Sylvia Lennox was killed?

36:15.674 --> 36:17.968
Bob's other big innovation was in sound.

36:18.844 --> 36:20.364
The traditional way of recording sound

36:20.470 --> 36:23.473
was to have a single boom mic
over the main actors heads.

36:23.765 --> 36:25.142
But that didn't work very well

36:25.434 --> 36:27.561
when you had a big ensemble cast.

36:27.853 --> 36:28.853
God dammit, Denis!

36:28.854 --> 36:30.856
That card went off the
table with the joker.

36:31.148 --> 36:32.608
That's why you wouldn't give it up!

36:32.900 --> 36:33.400
You are ridiculous.

36:33.692 --> 36:34.902
You said it wasn't even close.

36:35.194 --> 36:36.695
That's yesterday's news.

36:36.987 --> 36:37.988
You are working together.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.280
You're partners.

36:39.531 --> 36:47.531
You two mother-fucking creeps...
Stop with all the language.

36:48.624 --> 36:51.335
Anymore fighting you guys go out
of here for good, all right?

36:51.627 --> 36:53.707
They've been consistent
winners and I'm a big loser.

36:53.962 --> 36:55.672
You know I know how to play poker.

36:55.964 --> 36:57.883
Oh sour grapes, honey, sour grapes.

36:58.175 --> 37:00.385
All right, all right. Let's
get it back to normal.

37:00.677 --> 37:01.677
Lousy punk.

37:01.803 --> 37:02.803
You're not that good.

37:03.013 --> 37:04.014
Oh up yours.

37:05.933 --> 37:08.560
In "California Split" he
invented a way to use radio mics

37:08.852 --> 37:10.020
and 8 track recorders

37:10.312 --> 37:12.689
to simultaneously record each actor's lines

37:12.981 --> 37:15.859
on separate channels so that he
could patrol them in the mix.

37:17.110 --> 37:18.904
He wanted to give the audience the feeling

37:19.196 --> 37:20.405
they were in a real place

37:20.697 --> 37:22.978
and force them to choose which
conversation to listen to.

37:25.202 --> 37:28.163
A dollar says you don't
know who Glenn Riggs is.

37:30.082 --> 37:31.541
Uh, what's your name?

37:32.626 --> 37:33.752
Vince, the name's Vince.

37:34.044 --> 37:36.296
Vince, can you get me $30
from the cash register?

37:36.588 --> 37:37.798
What do you want $30 for?

37:38.090 --> 37:39.549
I need $30". In the bathroom.

37:39.841 --> 37:41.051
Renee, I'm only the bartender

37:41.343 --> 37:43.262
and I don't go in the cash register.

37:43.553 --> 37:44.553
Where's Jack?

37:44.721 --> 37:45.764
Jack went to a funeral.

37:46.056 --> 37:48.558
Look, I've been working
here for one year, right?

37:48.850 --> 37:51.061
Just give me a piece of
paper, chit $30 Renee.

37:51.353 --> 37:52.562
Okay, just give it to me.

37:52.854 --> 37:56.108
If I give you $30 and I come
up short, it'll be your ass.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.652
Baby you were born short
and it's always my ass.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.904
Captain midnight!!!

38:02.072 --> 38:04.741
Now everyone records that
way, but he was the first.

38:05.742 --> 38:08.787
His films just didn't look
or sound like anyone else's

38:09.079 --> 38:10.079
and they still don't.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.416
Doc. That's one.

38:12.708 --> 38:14.209
Dopey. That's two.

38:14.501 --> 38:16.503
Snoopy. There is no Snoopy.

38:16.795 --> 38:18.046
There ain't no Snoopy.

38:21.174 --> 38:22.676
Altmanesque.

38:26.972 --> 38:28.849
Showing Americans who we are.

38:59.921 --> 39:01.673
He was working on "Thieves Like Us"

39:01.965 --> 39:04.051
in Mississippi, a beautiful little film

39:04.343 --> 39:06.053
that Joan Tewkesbury wrote for him.

39:07.095 --> 39:09.723
Joan had worked as a script
supervisor on "McCabe".

39:10.474 --> 39:12.267
Bob, you know, would always discover talent

39:12.559 --> 39:13.977
and give people opportunities.

39:14.811 --> 39:16.563
Anyway, after she wrote "Thieves Like Us"

39:16.855 --> 39:18.398
Bob asked her to go to Nashville

39:18.690 --> 39:20.817
and keep a journal of what she saw.

39:31.203 --> 39:33.413
Well, she landed at the
airport, got into a car

39:33.705 --> 39:36.666
and the first thing she saw was
a car crash on the highway.

39:36.958 --> 39:38.752
It kept her stuck for two hours

39:39.044 --> 39:40.629
and that's how Bob opened the picture.

39:58.063 --> 39:59.823
It was a multi-layered
story with characters

39:59.940 --> 40:02.234
who crisscross each other
in the country music scene.

40:03.819 --> 40:05.404
But Bob thought it lacked something.

40:08.198 --> 40:12.702
Country music radiates
a love of this nation.

40:13.829 --> 40:14.913
Patriotism.

40:15.914 --> 40:20.335
Country music therefore
has those combinations,

40:20.627 --> 40:24.381
which are so essential
to America's character

40:24.673 --> 40:26.258
at a time that America needs character.

40:29.469 --> 40:31.763
At the time the whole water
Watergate thing was happening

40:32.055 --> 40:35.725
and he hated Nixon, so he
added a political angle.

40:37.018 --> 40:39.271
On the first Tuesday of November

40:39.563 --> 40:42.441
we have to make some vital
decisions about our management.

40:43.525 --> 40:45.193
Let me go directly to the point.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.863
I'm for doing some replacement.

40:55.370 --> 40:56.830
For mom and daddy.

40:57.122 --> 40:58.122
Thank you.

41:09.509 --> 41:10.802
Come on get up off your...

41:11.094 --> 41:12.804
Wait a minute Mayor, watch your head.

41:13.096 --> 41:14.473
Ya'll take it easy now.

41:14.764 --> 41:16.475
This isn't Dallas it's Nashville.

41:16.766 --> 41:17.225
This is Nashville.

41:17.517 --> 41:18.977
You show them what we're made of.

41:19.269 --> 41:21.271
They can't do this to us here in Nashville.

41:23.356 --> 41:24.356
Somebody sing, sing.

41:24.483 --> 41:25.650
Sing.

41:25.942 --> 41:28.737
Come on, I think you've been hurt.

41:29.029 --> 41:31.114
Oh, oh.

41:31.406 --> 41:32.616
Come on, easy, easy.

41:32.908 --> 41:35.952
Oh man, I can't stop that blood, man.

41:36.244 --> 41:37.244
Come on everybody sing.

41:37.329 --> 41:40.373
♪ It don't worry me ♪

41:41.291 --> 41:43.627
♪ It don't worry me ♪

41:45.420 --> 41:51.593

42:01.436 --> 42:07.817
♪ You may say, I agree, it don't worry me ♪

42:12.864 --> 42:14.824
It seems like so many of your films

42:15.116 --> 42:17.196
have a tendency to explode
American myths and genres

42:17.410 --> 42:20.539
and I just wondered, what's your
perception of American society?

42:21.289 --> 42:23.500
She thinks, she says am
I exploding the myths

42:23.792 --> 42:29.089
and are taking shots at
America and our culture.

42:29.589 --> 42:33.885
Uh, I, if that's the result
of it that's what I,

42:34.177 --> 42:35.470
that's the result of it.

42:35.762 --> 42:41.393
But what I'm doing is simply
reflecting what I see and feel.

42:42.519 --> 42:45.855
I live here, I was born
here, I love this country,

42:46.147 --> 42:49.234
I love, uh, this is all I
know, it's my culture.

42:50.485 --> 42:52.988
And, uh, I just try to show what I see.

42:53.280 --> 42:54.781
If it's ugly, that's what I see.

42:59.244 --> 43:01.413
Altmanesque what does it mean?

43:05.292 --> 43:07.919
Creating a family.

43:15.343 --> 43:18.179
By the mid 70's Bob was
riding his own wave.

43:18.471 --> 43:20.056
He had gathered so many talented people

43:20.348 --> 43:21.600
that he set up Lion's Gate,

43:21.891 --> 43:24.269
a studio that would
produce independent films

43:24.561 --> 43:26.479
to keep the people he cared about working

43:26.771 --> 43:28.356
in between his own movies.

43:31.401 --> 43:33.653
The first director he worked
with was Alan Rudolph.

43:34.195 --> 43:36.323
Alan started with Bob back as the second AD

43:36.615 --> 43:37.657
on "The Long Goodbye".

43:38.450 --> 43:41.077
He co-wrote Buffalo Bill
and became a close friend.

43:43.288 --> 43:46.958
And Lions Gate produced his
first film "Welcome to L.A.".

43:48.126 --> 43:50.337
Bob's only instructions to Alan were

43:50.629 --> 43:53.590
keep the budget low and
don't make a chase movie.

43:59.346 --> 44:02.057
The way Bob did it, making films
was always collaborative.

44:03.224 --> 44:05.226
His process was to bring
his friends together

44:05.518 --> 44:06.853
and let the film evolve.

44:08.730 --> 44:10.774
He encouraged everyone to contribute,

44:11.066 --> 44:13.318
but for him the most important
thing was the actors.

44:15.862 --> 44:20.200
I think the actors are the
main artistic element

44:20.492 --> 44:22.035
in any film.

44:22.327 --> 44:23.495
They're more important than the script.

44:23.787 --> 44:25.705
They're more important
than the photography.

44:25.997 --> 44:27.598
They're more important than the director

44:27.749 --> 44:29.292
because they're the ones that do it.

44:30.043 --> 44:33.630
So the more you can make
them your collaborator

44:33.922 --> 44:35.674
then you're getting the best of all worlds.

44:45.767 --> 44:47.769
I encourage actors to feel comfortable

44:48.061 --> 44:50.480
and to know they can go further.

44:51.231 --> 44:54.609
They can step over the edge
and I've got a safety net.

44:54.901 --> 44:57.237
I won't let them make a fool of themselves.

45:00.115 --> 45:04.994
I spent a lot of effort in
trying to make a family

45:05.286 --> 45:08.289
so that the actors become a part of it.

45:14.963 --> 45:18.800
Everybody comes to the
dailies, nobody's taking notes

45:19.092 --> 45:20.135
and there's booze

45:20.427 --> 45:23.430
and you find these actors
start rooting for each other.

45:25.557 --> 45:27.183
Okay, let's go.

45:30.854 --> 45:32.313
Your beautiful wife Antoinette

45:32.605 --> 45:36.443
tells me that you are an art collector.

45:41.322 --> 45:43.408
You certainly don't look
like an art collector.

45:44.701 --> 45:47.537
You know if you're walking down the street

45:47.829 --> 45:50.915
and somebody pointed you out and
asked me what I thought you did

45:51.207 --> 45:52.333
and I didn't know you

45:52.625 --> 45:55.253
I would never in a million
years guess art collector.

45:57.464 --> 46:00.091
You could go on what's my
line and stump the panel.

46:22.030 --> 46:24.491
I remembered we'd have these
big thanksgiving dinners

46:24.783 --> 46:27.535
and dad made it a lot of fun for all of us.

46:29.788 --> 46:30.872
But that and Christmas

46:31.164 --> 46:33.750
were the only times we'd be
alone with him as a family.

46:34.042 --> 46:35.376
Kathryn was always there for us,

46:35.668 --> 46:37.337
but dad was always working.

46:38.171 --> 46:40.465
For the most part, we
were not his priority.

46:40.757 --> 46:42.133
His movies were his priority.

46:43.510 --> 46:45.178
He loved us, but it was hard.

46:53.186 --> 46:54.813
I did five films at Fox.

46:55.772 --> 46:57.774
They were done almost
like independent films.

46:59.901 --> 47:04.656
Alan Ladd was running the studio
then and he was very supportive.

47:04.948 --> 47:09.661
He really stood up for
me and I owe him a lot.

47:12.997 --> 47:15.667
Grace Kelly was involved in the studio.

47:16.459 --> 47:18.169
And they had a board meeting

47:18.461 --> 47:23.216
and she said how could you
let this Altman person

47:23.508 --> 47:27.345
put my friend, Paul Newman,
in such a dreadful film.

47:28.555 --> 47:31.307
And Ladd-y just said oh shut up, I quit.

47:31.599 --> 47:33.142
And he got up and walked out

47:33.434 --> 47:35.436
and that was the end of him over there.

47:40.525 --> 47:43.111
"Quintet" came out, which
the critics hated.

47:43.486 --> 47:45.822
And a week later "A Perfect
Couple" was released,

47:46.114 --> 47:47.657
which the critics hated even more.

47:48.533 --> 47:52.662
So he was having a pretty
bad run at the box office

47:52.954 --> 47:54.122
and then came "health".

48:01.296 --> 48:03.006
I never stepped into one of these things;

48:03.298 --> 48:04.340
I hope there's a bottom.

48:04.632 --> 48:09.095
Mr. Altman, I thought I'd
ask you a couple things

48:09.387 --> 48:10.763
about the making of this film.

48:11.055 --> 48:12.140
Uh the title is health...

48:12.432 --> 48:13.975
What?

48:14.267 --> 48:17.353
I said the title is, the
title of the movie is health

48:17.645 --> 48:19.606
and I was gonna ask you

48:19.898 --> 48:22.567
if that's a particular
pre-occupation of yours

48:22.859 --> 48:26.029
or just what they call a
property you were interested in?

48:26.821 --> 48:29.157
No, I make lots of movies.

48:29.657 --> 48:33.661
Uh huh and the whole subject
of health, of course,

48:33.953 --> 48:35.204
involves a certain amount of controversy

48:35.496 --> 48:38.166
because there are stories, exposes,

48:38.458 --> 48:40.877
and so on about the food additives.

48:41.169 --> 48:43.010
The sort of thing that
where things advertised

48:43.171 --> 48:45.298
aren't what they claim to be and so on.

48:45.590 --> 48:46.674
Will that be a point

48:46.966 --> 48:49.886
that you'll be trying to take
satiric thrusts at in the movie?

48:50.178 --> 48:51.930
Think you could talk about that a bit?

48:52.221 --> 48:54.223
Uh, well, we don't have a script yet.

48:57.810 --> 48:59.020
All right, action.

48:59.771 --> 49:01.898
♪ I'm having a sugar fit ♪

49:02.190 --> 49:04.025
♪ Ooo ♪

49:04.317 --> 49:05.902
By the time we completed health

49:06.194 --> 49:08.404
there was a different management at Fox,

49:08.696 --> 49:10.176
they believed it wouldn't make money.

49:11.491 --> 49:14.577
We got in a little argument,
so the film was buried.

49:23.086 --> 49:24.545
Altmanesque?

49:28.800 --> 49:30.218
Expect the unexpected.

49:41.020 --> 49:43.231
Robert Evans saw Annie on Broadway

49:43.523 --> 49:45.233
and he wanted to do the movie version,

49:45.525 --> 49:47.402
but he couldn't get the rights.

49:47.694 --> 49:50.014
He found out that Paramount
owned "Popeye" the comic strip

49:50.238 --> 49:52.240
and he decided to make a big budget musical

49:52.532 --> 49:53.700
of "Popeye" instead.

49:57.745 --> 49:59.539
After a lot of directors turned it down,

49:59.831 --> 50:02.125
for some reason, Evans
sent the script to Bob.

50:02.417 --> 50:04.168
I remember seeing the script on his desk

50:04.460 --> 50:06.337
and saying to him Popeye?

50:16.097 --> 50:18.725
It was Robin Williams' first movie

50:19.017 --> 50:21.519
and Bob convinced the studio
to hire Shelley Duvall.

50:24.772 --> 50:28.985
And Paul Dooley, who was in
six or seven of Bob's films.

50:29.277 --> 50:30.778
He found the Pickle Family Circus,

50:31.070 --> 50:32.572
who were all clowns and jugglers.

50:33.823 --> 50:36.325
And Sweet Pea was played
by our grandson, Wesley.

50:36.617 --> 50:37.702
Christine's son.

50:41.289 --> 50:44.083
Wesley was born with
kind of a crooked smile.

50:44.375 --> 50:46.711
One day, Dad noticed when Wesley smiled

50:47.003 --> 50:48.463
he looked a lot like Popeye.

50:48.755 --> 50:51.382
He said "See, this is
where the pipe goes in."

50:51.674 --> 50:54.844
He was about 10 months old, he
hadn't even learned to walk yet,

50:55.136 --> 50:57.430
and Bob had him cast as Sweetpea.

50:57.722 --> 51:00.892
It was just one of those magical
moments in how he cast people.

51:02.685 --> 51:04.896
Okay, everybody, stand by.

51:05.438 --> 51:06.438
Action.

51:10.026 --> 51:11.986
The production spent
millions building a village

51:12.278 --> 51:13.946
into a barren hillside

51:14.238 --> 51:18.326
and about 3 minutes into the
film things started to go wrong.

51:29.712 --> 51:32.590
After losing 21 days of
shooting to bad weather,

51:32.882 --> 51:34.717
going several million dollars over budget,

51:35.009 --> 51:37.970
and the studio threatening
to pull the plug,

51:38.262 --> 51:41.015
Bob wasn't even sure he
could finish the film.

51:46.270 --> 51:48.064
Tonight in Hollywood, Paramount and Disney

51:48.356 --> 51:51.818
unveil their highly anticipated
Christmas Blockbuster "Popeye",

51:52.110 --> 51:53.694
and what a scene it was.

52:03.454 --> 52:05.414
Good morning and welcome
to the critic's corner.

52:05.706 --> 52:06.706
For years "Popeye"

52:06.791 --> 52:08.417
has been one of my favorite
comic strip characters.

52:08.709 --> 52:10.962
So, I and millions of others
have been looking forward

52:11.254 --> 52:14.173
to the big Hollywood "Popeye"
movie with joyous anticipation.

52:14.632 --> 52:16.467
The cast look perfect for the parts,

52:16.759 --> 52:18.594
the writer was the estimable Jules Feifier

52:18.886 --> 52:20.366
and the director was the imaginative,

52:20.638 --> 52:22.038
though inconsistent, Robert Altman.

52:22.098 --> 52:23.474
What could go wrong?

52:23.766 --> 52:25.101
Well just about everything.

52:25.393 --> 52:26.644
And the disappointing news this morning

52:26.936 --> 52:28.938
is that "Popeye" is a debacle

52:29.230 --> 52:30.940
with the characters left in ruins.

52:31.232 --> 52:34.026
First of all, Feifier fails.

52:34.318 --> 52:35.879
His script that shot is undistinguished

52:35.987 --> 52:37.697
and it is without humour, but above all,

52:37.989 --> 52:39.110
the culprit is Robert Altman

52:39.240 --> 52:41.200
whose direction and editing are ponderous,

52:41.492 --> 52:43.119
hesitant, and almost incoherent.

52:43.411 --> 52:44.411
The members of this cast,

52:44.662 --> 52:46.414
who almost seem born to play these rolls,

52:46.706 --> 52:48.958
have been subverted by their director.

52:49.250 --> 52:51.170
Paul Dooley who plays the
hamburger loving Wimpy

52:51.294 --> 52:54.005
with such relish is giving nothing to do.

52:54.297 --> 52:54.839
I mean nothing.

52:55.131 --> 52:57.967
Zilch, zero, gornish, nada, zip.

52:58.259 --> 53:00.178
Robin Williams has the
cartoon character down,

53:00.469 --> 53:02.305
but much of his dialogue is unintelligible

53:02.597 --> 53:05.516
and much of what is intelligible
is incomprehensible.

53:05.808 --> 53:08.060
The songs by Harry Neilson are calamity.

53:08.352 --> 53:11.355
His music is tuneless and
his lyrics are moronic.

53:11.647 --> 53:13.065
Shelley Duvall is just wonderful,

53:13.357 --> 53:14.942
thank goodness for Shelley Duvall.

53:15.234 --> 53:17.320
Just think of this, for
years and years "Popeye"

53:17.612 --> 53:18.946
has been chugalugging spinach

53:19.238 --> 53:21.741
and when he finally gets
something to go with the spinach

53:22.033 --> 53:23.743
it turns out to be a turkey.

53:25.703 --> 53:30.041
The critics trashed it and
Bob took most of the blame.

53:30.333 --> 53:31.733
It was nowhere near the blockbuster

53:32.001 --> 53:35.630
the studios were hoping for.

53:42.220 --> 53:44.055
The films that they want to make now,

53:44.347 --> 53:46.933
the major companies, um, are not,

53:47.225 --> 53:48.935
they're films that I don't want to make.

53:49.227 --> 53:50.227
Also, I can't make.

53:50.394 --> 53:53.272
I can't make "Superman", and
"Raiders of the Lost Arc"

53:53.564 --> 53:56.442
and, uh, and I don't want to.

53:57.151 --> 54:00.821
And the films I do want to
make and feel that I can make,

54:01.113 --> 54:02.114
they don't want to make.

54:02.406 --> 54:04.242
They want movies now that will...

54:04.533 --> 54:07.245
there's a magic number that they
use, a hundred million dollars.

54:08.704 --> 54:10.915
And, um, I just can't do that.

54:12.166 --> 54:14.126
It's just the time to split, that's all

54:14.418 --> 54:16.462
and by splitting I mean separate.

54:31.602 --> 54:35.690
It was pretty rough, the
phone stopped ringing.

54:35.982 --> 54:37.692
I said well where should I cut back,

54:37.984 --> 54:39.151
or what should I do?

54:39.443 --> 54:40.443
We can sell the house.

54:40.695 --> 54:41.695
Move to New York.

54:43.197 --> 54:44.240
He was pretty down.

54:45.700 --> 54:47.368
He worried his luck had run out.

54:48.369 --> 54:50.538
You ever bet $10,000 on a football game?

54:50.830 --> 54:51.163
Oh yeah.

54:51.455 --> 54:51.872
You have?

54:52.164 --> 54:53.249
Mmhmm.

54:53.541 --> 54:54.541
Do you win much?

54:54.667 --> 54:57.253
I'm behind.

54:57.545 --> 55:00.423
This has not been, the last
three years has not been good.

55:07.263 --> 55:09.098
What does Altmanesque mean?

55:09.390 --> 55:10.390
Uh...

55:10.433 --> 55:12.560
I would say it means never giving up.

55:20.151 --> 55:22.486
The fact that Bob couldn't
get any movie deals

55:22.778 --> 55:23.446
didn't stop him.

55:23.738 --> 55:24.739
Pretty quickly he found something

55:25.031 --> 55:27.658
he really wanted to do, live theater.

55:31.245 --> 55:34.165
You know I still don't like
being touched or held?

55:34.999 --> 55:37.418
When you extend your hand,
when you really give,

55:37.710 --> 55:39.170
you lay your heart on the table

55:39.462 --> 55:41.005
and hand someone else the hammer.

55:43.215 --> 55:44.759
Now there might be some people

55:45.051 --> 55:47.762
who feel this is somewhat of
a fall from grace for you

55:48.054 --> 55:50.181
after directing major
films for so many years,

55:50.473 --> 55:52.433
to direct a couple of small plays.

55:52.725 --> 55:54.086
Not saying they're not good plays,

55:54.226 --> 55:56.312
but small plays in a small theater,

55:56.604 --> 55:58.314
off Broadway so to speak.

55:58.606 --> 56:00.691
Well I think it's a step up.

56:08.407 --> 56:10.117
I did four or five theater pieces.

56:10.409 --> 56:13.120
And when I'd do one I'd say
oh, let's do another one.

56:13.412 --> 56:15.456
So, to me, that was a very important,

56:15.748 --> 56:18.125
big time, "I" time in my life.

56:18.417 --> 56:19.417
I was experimenting.

56:28.552 --> 56:31.430
I went to the University of Michigan.

56:31.722 --> 56:35.142
I had done an opera there
a couple years before

56:35.434 --> 56:37.895
and I didn't have the
money to produce a film,

56:38.187 --> 56:41.690
but I came up with a scheme
of making it a course.

56:43.901 --> 56:45.569
And so all of the crew,

56:45.861 --> 56:47.988
except for a couple of us, were students

56:48.280 --> 56:50.074
and they got a credit for doing this.

56:50.574 --> 56:53.702
Yeah, let's just take this, open
it up from where he gets up

56:53.994 --> 56:56.497
and walks out of the frame on the set.

56:57.498 --> 56:59.583
Start on the monitors.

57:00.084 --> 57:05.089
Now, when he gets up to leave
make your pan to the door.

57:06.757 --> 57:09.427
My little dog, Checkers, he... PFT.

57:23.267 --> 57:24.267
What?!

57:24.275 --> 57:25.568
No, mother.

57:26.277 --> 57:29.655
I did not elect myself,
they elected me not once,

57:29.947 --> 57:31.991
not twice, but all of my goddamn life,

57:32.283 --> 57:34.994
and they would do it again
to, if they had the chance.

57:35.286 --> 57:37.830
Oh, sure, they said they didn't trust me.

57:38.122 --> 57:41.292
They said let Dick Nixon
do it and I did it.

57:41.584 --> 57:43.836
They said they wouldn't
buy a used car from me,

57:44.128 --> 57:47.173
but they gave me the biggest
vote in American history.

57:48.340 --> 57:50.509
And they ﬂushed me down the toilet

57:50.801 --> 57:52.386
and they wanted me to stay down.

57:53.721 --> 57:55.723
They wanted me to kill myself.

57:57.141 --> 57:58.642
Well, I won't do it.

57:58.934 --> 58:01.604
If they want me dead,
they'll have to do it.

58:03.856 --> 58:06.650
Fuck them! Fuck them!

58:06.942 --> 58:09.069
Fuck them! Fuck them!

58:09.361 --> 58:11.280
Fuck them!

58:14.158 --> 58:16.994
I never met Richard Nixon in my life,

58:17.286 --> 58:19.872
but I did have a couple
of exchanges with him

58:20.164 --> 58:21.164
more than once.

58:21.165 --> 58:24.084
He wrote a book called "Leaders",

58:24.376 --> 58:26.170
which was a really big book.

58:27.838 --> 58:31.008
And I was living in California at the time

58:31.300 --> 58:36.013
and in the mail this
book, heavy book, comes.

58:36.305 --> 58:42.394
And it was from the Ex-President
and it was inscribed in there,

58:42.686 --> 58:43.896
it says to Robert Altman,

58:44.188 --> 58:46.190
thank you for your years of loyal support.

58:48.192 --> 58:49.693
What?

58:49.985 --> 58:52.321
And I thought, shit, I gotta burn a book.

58:54.448 --> 58:56.909
And I really had a dilemma.

58:59.828 --> 59:01.497
I could of torn out that page,

59:01.789 --> 59:02.998
which ultimately I did

59:03.290 --> 59:08.963
because I didn't want it
to be found in my archives

59:09.255 --> 59:13.509
by one of my great
grandchildren and they say oh,

59:13.801 --> 59:15.970
grand daddy was a big Nixon supporter.

59:35.114 --> 59:36.907
After "Secret Honour" we sold the house

59:37.199 --> 59:38.325
and moved to Paris.

59:38.867 --> 59:42.454
He felt appreciated there, as
so many American Artists do.

59:45.833 --> 59:47.835
Bob, remember that shower scene in MASH

59:48.127 --> 59:49.670
where you made me get naked?

59:49.962 --> 59:50.962
You get naked.

01:00:01.515 --> 01:00:03.767
For a while now, dad had been hiring me

01:00:04.059 --> 01:00:05.894
and my brother, Bobby, to work with him.

01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:08.397
I started out in props

01:00:08.689 --> 01:00:10.530
and eventually became his
production designer.

01:00:12.026 --> 01:00:14.028
This is our ace prop man, Steve Altman.

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.561
Steve, do you have anything
to say about the production?

01:00:16.822 --> 01:00:17.822
Hi mom.

01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:19.470
And Bobby became his camera operator.

01:00:20.409 --> 01:00:24.747
Working with him, it was good, I
got to see him and I got paid.

01:00:36.592 --> 01:00:38.344
Working out of Paris he shot anywhere

01:00:38.636 --> 01:00:40.095
he could get a deal.

01:00:40.763 --> 01:00:43.474
Mostly small films, financed
with European money

01:00:43.766 --> 01:00:46.101
or by the new U.S. cable channels

01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:47.686
who gave him total freedom.

01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:05.621
Come on right around here
and just fill in here,

01:01:05.913 --> 01:01:06.913
make this pretty.

01:01:06.914 --> 01:01:09.833
Give me as many people
on this side as I can.

01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:11.960
Michael, Cynthia.

01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:13.587
Tighten on in, everybody.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.340
You got enough ﬂoor ground;

01:01:16.632 --> 01:01:18.384
We will need some people now over here.

01:01:19.593 --> 01:01:21.762
Kathy, come on up in here everybody.

01:01:22.513 --> 01:01:24.723
We need people in here, around this area.

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:26.350
Okay stand by please.

01:01:26.642 --> 01:01:27.642
Okay, action Michael.

01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:31.188
Let there be no mistake about it,

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:34.358
as the people of conscience, we cannot,

01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:41.115
we must not settle for anything
less than a comprehensive,

01:01:41.407 --> 01:01:43.951
global boycott of South Africa.

01:01:44.243 --> 01:01:45.243
Yes.

01:01:45.285 --> 01:01:46.370
Ya!

01:01:46.662 --> 01:01:49.415
Michael, that was terrific, I
just want to do one more please.

01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:54.920
HBO wanted to do something
about the election.

01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:56.755
So Garry Trudeau and I said

01:01:57.047 --> 01:02:00.300
let's just run a guy for
President, so we did.

01:02:04.012 --> 01:02:06.682
We took Michael Murphy,
who played Jack Tanner,

01:02:06.974 --> 01:02:08.517
and we created a staff

01:02:08.809 --> 01:02:11.770
and we infiltrated them
in to actual situations.

01:02:15.482 --> 01:02:16.482
Pat, how are ya?

01:02:16.692 --> 01:02:17.025
<i>HEY-</i>

01:02:17.317 --> 01:02:17.985
Nice to see you.

01:02:18.277 --> 01:02:19.317
This is my daughter, Alex.

01:02:19.486 --> 01:02:19.695
Hi.

01:02:19.987 --> 01:02:20.320
How are you?

01:02:20.612 --> 01:02:21.612
Good, how are you?

01:02:21.613 --> 01:02:23.323
Sure stirring them up in my home state.

01:02:23.615 --> 01:02:25.325
Well Michigan is a strong one for me,

01:02:25.617 --> 01:02:26.617
you know that Jack.

01:02:26.618 --> 01:02:28.829
I'll say it made me glad to be a democrat;

01:02:29.121 --> 01:02:30.831
I wouldn't want to be up against you.

01:02:31.123 --> 01:02:33.333
Well the Republicans are
going to be tough this year

01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:34.835
but we wish you the best.

01:02:35.127 --> 01:02:36.287
Looking tougher all the time.

01:02:38.338 --> 01:02:40.215
Let's go over the ground rules now.

01:02:40.507 --> 01:02:42.009
The panel will give direct questions

01:02:42.301 --> 01:02:43.301
to specific candidates.

01:02:43.469 --> 01:02:45.804
What we're doing is, we
don't know what to call it

01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:50.601
because it's not a documentary,
it's not fictional,

01:02:50.893 --> 01:02:53.729
um, I call it experimental television.

01:02:54.897 --> 01:02:57.191
We must stop the flow of
drugs in this country.

01:02:57.483 --> 01:03:00.235
The number one threat on the
streets of our nation today.

01:03:00.527 --> 01:03:03.113
Our borders are militarily inferior

01:03:03.405 --> 01:03:06.033
in terms of being protected
from drugs trafficking...

01:03:06.325 --> 01:03:08.368
Jesse... Jesse... As you may recall,

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:11.121
it was former President Nixon
who started the war on drugs,

01:03:11.413 --> 01:03:12.748
the same former President Nixon

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.542
who couldn't seal off South
Vietnam from North Vietnam

01:03:15.834 --> 01:03:17.586
with 500,000 troops.

01:03:18.837 --> 01:03:21.548
America's tired of being
dragged into wars it can't win

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:23.801
and a war on drugs is a loser.

01:03:24.551 --> 01:03:28.472
And any law that makes 25
million Americans criminals

01:03:28.764 --> 01:03:29.764
is a loser.

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:31.141
It's time to get real.

01:03:31.683 --> 01:03:34.186
The only way to get drugs off our streets

01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:35.479
is through legalization.

01:03:35.771 --> 01:03:36.104
Ho-ho!

01:03:36.396 --> 01:03:36.772
What?

01:03:37.064 --> 01:03:39.107
He said it, he said it.

01:03:39.399 --> 01:03:41.193
Did he say legalization?

01:03:41.485 --> 01:03:43.237
There goes the street value of my stash.

01:03:43.529 --> 01:03:45.405
I think the people, with all do respect,

01:03:45.697 --> 01:03:48.075
are more than ready to
elect a black President,

01:03:48.367 --> 01:03:50.244
I just don't think they're ready for you.

01:03:50.536 --> 01:03:51.536
Whoa!

01:03:51.578 --> 01:03:53.419
What did they put in his
oatmeal this morning?

01:03:53.705 --> 01:03:54.957
This is going ballistic.

01:03:58.252 --> 01:04:00.587
Okay, what kind of spin do we put on that?

01:04:03.215 --> 01:04:06.718
"Tanner '88" I think is probably
the best work that I've done,

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:09.304
I think it's the most inventive.

01:04:09.596 --> 01:04:12.099
Because we really did change television.

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:24.278
This is WNBC New York, I'm Larry Stack

01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:26.446
and here's what's happening at 2 o'clock.

01:04:26.738 --> 01:04:27.938
President Bush proposed to add

01:04:28.073 --> 01:04:30.784
an additional 1.2 billion
dollars to the budget

01:04:31.076 --> 01:04:33.704
for the war on drugs
including a 50% increase

01:04:33.996 --> 01:04:35.372
in military spending.

01:04:37.457 --> 01:04:38.792
You've moved back to America

01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:40.210
after being based in Paris.

01:04:40.502 --> 01:04:41.623
Do you think you've changed?

01:04:42.588 --> 01:04:43.964
I don't think I've changed.

01:04:44.256 --> 01:04:46.508
I think I just keep doing the same thing

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:49.011
and occasionally what I do

01:04:49.303 --> 01:04:52.806
crosses with the general
attitude of the public

01:04:53.098 --> 01:04:56.810
and it becomes very successful
and then I'm a failure,

01:04:57.102 --> 01:04:59.396
and a has been, and then
I cross back again.

01:04:59.688 --> 01:05:02.524
But I'm going straight... to me
I'm going in a straight line.

01:05:02.816 --> 01:05:04.484
Everybody else is just going like this.

01:05:08.864 --> 01:05:09.864
Altmanesque.

01:05:12.367 --> 01:05:13.367
Kicking Hollywood's ass.

01:05:18.373 --> 01:05:21.668
Most of the scripts that they
send me are studio scripts.

01:05:22.294 --> 01:05:25.255
I mean, I'd be embarrassed
to be associated with them.

01:05:25.964 --> 01:05:27.758
I don't think there's anything I could do

01:05:28.050 --> 01:05:29.885
other than radically change them,

01:05:30.177 --> 01:05:31.887
which these people don't want.

01:05:33.013 --> 01:05:35.515
I make gloves and they sell shoes.

01:05:40.812 --> 01:05:42.397
David Brown, the producer, told Bob

01:05:42.689 --> 01:05:45.275
that he had a project that
Bob was born to direct

01:05:45.567 --> 01:05:47.027
because it struck at everything

01:05:47.319 --> 01:05:49.029
that was wrong with Hollywood.

01:05:54.785 --> 01:05:57.871
And it was true, nobody but Bob
could of pulled off "The Player"

01:05:58.163 --> 01:05:59.289
the way he did.

01:06:00.791 --> 01:06:02.209
It gave him the chance to

01:06:02.501 --> 01:06:05.253
crucify forever Hollywood's
entire way of making movies.

01:06:11.969 --> 01:06:13.845
Griffin, Griffin hi.

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:14.513
Griffin hi.

01:06:14.805 --> 01:06:15.805
A-A-Adam Simon.

01:06:15.931 --> 01:06:17.683
I know we're not supposed to
meet until next week but...

01:06:17.975 --> 01:06:19.695
I didn't realize we were meeting next week.

01:06:19.977 --> 01:06:22.688
Well, yeah, I just wanted to
plant a seed in your head...

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:23.980
Sorry, I'm booked up,

01:06:24.022 --> 01:06:25.143
Okay, but just picture this.

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:27.776
Okay, it's a planet in the
far future with two suns.

01:06:28.068 --> 01:06:29.068
Who plays the sons?

01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:30.070
No-no-no, suns, large solar disks.

01:06:30.362 --> 01:06:32.322
Listen, you gotta run this
idea by Bonnie Sherow.

01:06:32.614 --> 01:06:35.409
The pictures they make these
days are all MTV, cut cut cut.

01:06:35.701 --> 01:06:37.421
The opening shot of Welles' "Touch of Evil"

01:06:37.703 --> 01:06:39.162
was six and a half minutes long.

01:06:39.454 --> 01:06:40.706
Six and a half minutes, Walter?

01:06:40.998 --> 01:06:42.079
Well three or four anyways,

01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:44.543
he set up that whole picture
with one tracking shot.

01:06:47.796 --> 01:06:51.466
"The Graduate" Part ll.

01:06:51.758 --> 01:06:52.758
Oh good, good.

01:06:52.843 --> 01:06:54.923
Now listen, the three
principles are still with us...

01:06:55.095 --> 01:06:58.390
Dustin Hoffman, Anne
Bancroft, Katharine Ross.

01:06:58.682 --> 01:06:59.682
Mmhmm.

01:06:59.725 --> 01:07:01.268
Twenty-five years later and
so are the characters.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:05.897
Ben, Elaine and Mrs. Robinson.

01:07:06.189 --> 01:07:08.108
Ben and Elaine are married, still.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.277
They live in a big, old, spooky house

01:07:10.569 --> 01:07:12.612
up in northern California somewhere.

01:07:12.904 --> 01:07:15.949
And Mrs. Robinson lives with them.

01:07:16.241 --> 01:07:19.911
Her aging mother, who's had a stroke...

01:07:20.203 --> 01:07:21.284
Mrs. Robinson had a stroke?

01:07:21.455 --> 01:07:23.457
Mrs. Robinson had a stroke,
so she can't talk.

01:07:23.749 --> 01:07:25.000
Is this going to be funny?

01:07:25.292 --> 01:07:26.292
Yeah, it'll be funny.

01:07:26.334 --> 01:07:27.002
With a stroke?

01:07:27.294 --> 01:07:29.135
Dark, and weird, and
funny, and with a stroke.

01:07:37.888 --> 01:07:40.557
It's a T.V. star and she goes
to the safari, to Africa.

01:07:40.849 --> 01:07:43.310
Are you talking about a T.V.
star in a motion picture?

01:07:43.602 --> 01:07:44.811
No, not a real T.V. star.

01:07:45.103 --> 01:07:46.813
It would be played by a movie star.

01:07:47.105 --> 01:07:48.666
A movie star playing a television star.

01:07:48.899 --> 01:07:50.020
Julia Roberts would be good.

01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:51.231
Dolly Parton would be good.

01:07:51.443 --> 01:07:53.028
Dolly, Dolly, yeah.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:54.320
I like Goldie.

01:07:54.321 --> 01:07:55.655
Goldie, great, because
we have a relationship.

01:07:55.947 --> 01:07:58.700
Goldie goes to Africa.

01:07:58.992 --> 01:07:59.992
Goldie goes to Africa.

01:08:00.202 --> 01:08:01.283
And she becomes worshipped.

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:08.585
Political doesn't scare me.

01:08:08.877 --> 01:08:10.003
Radical political scares me.

01:08:10.295 --> 01:08:11.495
Political political scares me.

01:08:11.546 --> 01:08:13.026
This is politely politically radical.

01:08:13.298 --> 01:08:13.924
Is it funny?

01:08:14.216 --> 01:08:14.716
It's funny.

01:08:15.008 --> 01:08:16.167
It's a funny political thing.

01:08:16.259 --> 01:08:17.969
It's a funny, and it's a thriller too.

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:18.804
It's a thriller.

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:20.095
It's all at once.

01:08:20.096 --> 01:08:21.096
So, uh, what's the story?

01:08:21.305 --> 01:08:22.305
Well I want Bruce Willis.

01:08:22.557 --> 01:08:22.974
Mmhmm.

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:24.350
I think I can talk to him.

01:08:24.643 --> 01:08:27.145
It's a story about a senator,
a bad-guy senator at first.

01:08:27.437 --> 01:08:29.877
And he's travelling around the
country on the country's dime,

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:31.899
you know, uh, like that Sununu guy used to.

01:08:32.192 --> 01:08:34.232
It's sort of a cynical,
political, thriller comedy.

01:08:34.236 --> 01:08:36.696
Yeah, but it's got a heart,
uh, in the right spot

01:08:36.988 --> 01:08:38.240
and anyways he has an accident.

01:08:38.532 --> 01:08:39.533
An accident?

01:08:39.825 --> 01:08:42.577
Yeah, and he becomes
clairvoyant, like a psychic.

01:08:42.868 --> 01:08:43.995
Oh, I see.

01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:45.287
Yeah.

01:08:45.372 --> 01:08:46.832
So it's kind of a psychic,
political, thriller, comedy

01:08:47.124 --> 01:08:47.624
with a heart.

01:08:47.916 --> 01:08:50.001
With a heart,

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:51.795
and not unlike Ghost meets
Manchurian Candidate.

01:08:52.087 --> 01:08:53.296
Go on, go on, I'm listening.

01:08:53.587 --> 01:08:55.308
Anyway, he can start to read people's minds

01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:57.300
and when he gets to the president's mind

01:08:57.591 --> 01:08:58.591
it's completely blank.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:05.517
Mr. Altman, is "The Player"
your revenge against Hollywood?

01:09:06.017 --> 01:09:08.770
No, it's a very, very mild indictment.

01:09:09.187 --> 01:09:11.523
Things aren't really like
that, they're much worse.

01:09:22.951 --> 01:09:24.493
Mr. Altman, I have to ask you,

01:09:24.786 --> 01:09:27.330
do you think Hollywood has
lost its' objectivity?

01:09:28.206 --> 01:09:29.666
No, I think that Hollywood

01:09:29.957 --> 01:09:33.920
has always maintained its' objectivity,

01:09:34.212 --> 01:09:37.716
which is greed and making
as much money as it can

01:09:38.008 --> 01:09:40.385
and trying to get rid of all the artists.

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:42.220
Of course they can't succeed in that,

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:45.390
so since they can't really get rid of us

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:47.767
we just keep popping up and going along.

01:09:50.604 --> 01:09:52.606
And now we have the presentation

01:09:52.898 --> 01:09:55.609
of the Palme D'or for Best Director.

01:09:56.735 --> 01:10:01.281
The Palme D'or for Best
Director goes to Robert Altman

01:10:01.573 --> 01:10:02.199
for "The Player".

01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:03.992
"The Player" Robert Altman!

01:10:18.173 --> 01:10:19.299
Thank you.

01:10:24.304 --> 01:10:26.431
"The Player" was a huge hit in Cannes.

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:28.266
Everyone wanted to meet with him

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:30.268
and he finally found backers for a film

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.312
he had been wanting to do for years.

01:11:08.306 --> 01:11:09.786
In "Short Cuts" Bob took a collection

01:11:10.058 --> 01:11:11.935
of Raymond Carver's short stories

01:11:12.227 --> 01:11:14.980
and adapted them into one
multi-layered story.

01:11:22.279 --> 01:11:23.999
I think Bob connected with Carver's stories

01:11:24.155 --> 01:11:26.283
because they were about the
lives of ordinary people.

01:11:27.158 --> 01:11:28.868
The frailness of human behavior.

01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:31.663
The randomness of things
that happen in life.

01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:36.333
It's coming.

01:11:37.043 --> 01:11:38.795
I know, I know, come here.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:44.800
<i>Jerry“.</i>

01:11:46.553 --> 01:11:48.096
Okay, look, look it.

01:11:51.474 --> 01:11:52.474
What's happening Howard?

01:11:52.726 --> 01:11:53.852
Howard?

01:11:54.144 --> 01:11:55.645
We have to get under the table.

01:11:57.856 --> 01:11:59.107
Gene, earthquake!

01:11:59.399 --> 01:12:00.900
Get under the door, come on!

01:12:01.192 --> 01:12:02.192
Quick!

01:12:02.444 --> 01:12:03.945
Get underneath the door!

01:12:04.487 --> 01:12:05.613
This is Officer Gene Shepard

01:12:05.905 --> 01:12:07.699
of the Los Angeles Police Department.

01:12:07.991 --> 01:12:10.327
We are currently
experiencing an earthquake.

01:12:25.168 --> 01:12:26.168
Jesus.

01:12:26.176 --> 01:12:27.576
This is bigger than the one in '71.

01:12:27.761 --> 01:12:28.803
Don't worry. Don't worry.

01:12:29.095 --> 01:12:30.221
It's not the big one.

01:12:30.513 --> 01:12:30.889
Earthquake!

01:12:31.181 --> 01:12:32.302
Mommy, get over here, quick!

01:12:32.307 --> 01:12:33.516
Get down.

01:12:33.808 --> 01:12:35.226
Just lay down, Mommy.

01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:36.686
Just lay down.

01:12:38.605 --> 01:12:40.648
This is it, baby! We're going out together.

01:12:43.068 --> 01:12:44.569
This is the big one, baby.

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:50.866
Wasn't the big one.

01:12:55.163 --> 01:12:57.957
If we were able to explain
any of these characters

01:12:58.249 --> 01:13:01.544
it's the very fact that
things happen to them

01:13:01.836 --> 01:13:03.546
and they are inexplicable

01:13:03.838 --> 01:13:06.383
because I think that's more truthful

01:13:06.674 --> 01:13:07.967
to the way life really is.

01:13:10.428 --> 01:13:11.638
Jerry!

01:13:18.686 --> 01:13:21.439
Altmanesque, what does it mean?

01:13:24.484 --> 01:13:26.069
How vulnerable we are.

01:13:31.157 --> 01:13:32.826
Talking with Robert Altman.

01:13:33.118 --> 01:13:36.121
Well what's left of you from
the success of your diet?

01:13:36.413 --> 01:13:37.413
Thank you.

01:13:37.622 --> 01:13:41.084
I'm glad that you mentioned
that, people think I'm sick.

01:13:41.376 --> 01:13:42.544
He's ill, he's lost weight.

01:13:42.836 --> 01:13:44.754
I've lost about 35 pounds and I'm,

01:13:45.046 --> 01:13:47.507
I got about a few more to go.

01:13:48.133 --> 01:13:53.179
I just figured it'll add
some longevity to the...

01:13:53.471 --> 01:13:56.099
I see the light at the end of the tunnel.

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:03.731
The doctor said you have an enlarged heart.

01:14:04.023 --> 01:14:06.568
You shouldn't do this or that
and you shouldn't drink.

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.661
But it never stopped him
from doing anything.

01:14:15.994 --> 01:14:17.078
I heard him yelling,

01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:19.539
he's like, I think we have a problem here.

01:14:20.665 --> 01:14:23.460
So I ran downstairs and he
couldn't remember my name.

01:14:24.669 --> 01:14:28.339
I called the doctor and as I
was helping him get dressed,

01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:32.469
he looks up at me and
says Konni if this is it,

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:33.760
it's been great.

01:14:36.639 --> 01:14:37.932
It was a micro stroke.

01:14:44.272 --> 01:14:46.274
He gave up drinking, that was hard.

01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:49.736
He says the only thing I miss
about drinking is the alcohol.

01:14:50.778 --> 01:14:51.778
He was great.

01:14:51.863 --> 01:14:54.491
He was still fun and
funny, but he was thin.

01:15:51.464 --> 01:15:53.049
Pret-a-Porter was difficult.

01:15:53.758 --> 01:15:57.387
That he managed to make that
movie was an accomplishment,

01:15:57.679 --> 01:15:58.721
but he kept on working.

01:16:07.772 --> 01:16:10.608
Start the music and we're
bringing them through.

01:16:14.445 --> 01:16:21.327
As soon as... As soon as these
kids who are going through

01:16:21.619 --> 01:16:26.040
get right under here, as soon
as you lose sight of them

01:16:26.332 --> 01:16:27.584
you're going to move on over.

01:16:35.842 --> 01:16:39.012
"Kansas City" came out of his
memories of growing up there.

01:16:39.304 --> 01:16:41.806
Especially of jazz music, which he loved.

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:46.144
But he barely made it through that film.

01:16:47.353 --> 01:16:49.355
It was his heart, it was giving out.

01:16:54.235 --> 01:16:57.530
The doctor said I think
you need a transplant.

01:16:57.822 --> 01:16:59.490
And Bob said what are the odds?

01:17:24.349 --> 01:17:25.558
He rested for a whole year.

01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:27.935
Learning how to live with a new heart

01:17:28.227 --> 01:17:29.562
and handle possible rejection,

01:17:29.854 --> 01:17:32.357
and medication and a whole regimen.

01:17:38.821 --> 01:17:40.239
I kept it quiet

01:17:40.531 --> 01:17:43.743
because I was afraid nobody would hire me,

01:17:44.035 --> 01:17:45.995
because there's such a stigma to it.

01:17:51.876 --> 01:17:54.671
By his 71st birthday he looked terrific.

01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:58.216
He was really with it and
excited to get back to work.

01:18:06.349 --> 01:18:08.267
I love what I do.

01:18:09.227 --> 01:18:12.480
I love the actors and what they do.

01:18:12.772 --> 01:18:16.484
And it's just such a delight

01:18:16.776 --> 01:18:19.821
to sit there and watch
people create something

01:18:20.113 --> 01:18:22.699
and know that you're a part of it.

01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:26.536
It's just... I don't ever want to stop it.

01:18:34.419 --> 01:18:37.380
Storytelling.

01:18:39.382 --> 01:18:40.842
Masterful storytelling.

01:18:48.307 --> 01:18:50.309
All right, well, what do you want to do?

01:18:50.601 --> 01:18:53.104
Should we just shoot one
and see how bad it is?

01:18:53.396 --> 01:18:54.396
Let's shoot one.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:56.107
I mean, see how good it is.

01:18:56.399 --> 01:18:57.817
Let's waste film.

01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:00.737
I have a lot of stock in Eastman.

01:19:01.821 --> 01:19:02.905
All right, let's do it.

01:19:04.866 --> 01:19:06.451
Action servants.

01:19:10.413 --> 01:19:12.790
"Gosford Park" was one
of Bob's masterpieces,

01:19:13.082 --> 01:19:14.459
but it almost never got made.

01:19:17.545 --> 01:19:18.906
We couldn't line up the financing.

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:20.423
It just kept falling apart.

01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:22.340
What scared the investors

01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:24.802
were the exact things he loved about it.

01:19:25.094 --> 01:19:27.555
Big ensemble cast, unresolved ending.

01:19:28.848 --> 01:19:30.433
One guy said he'd finance the film

01:19:30.725 --> 01:19:32.101
if Bob would rewrite the ending

01:19:32.393 --> 01:19:35.438
to make it a traditional
murder-mystery, but Bob refused.

01:19:39.192 --> 01:19:41.319
With zero funding and no investors

01:19:41.611 --> 01:19:43.362
he called up every A-List actor in London

01:19:43.654 --> 01:19:45.865
and said we're making this movie.

01:19:46.157 --> 01:19:48.618
They were like absolutely
I'd love to work with you.

01:19:52.163 --> 01:19:55.500
We were close to shooting, the
producers are freaking out

01:19:55.792 --> 01:19:57.293
and Bob is totally cool,

01:19:57.585 --> 01:20:01.130
like he knows everything
is going to work out.

01:20:01.422 --> 01:20:03.299
And then we got the call.

01:20:03.591 --> 01:20:06.803
The British Lottery fund
agreed to back the film.

01:20:07.094 --> 01:20:08.094
He won the lottery.

01:20:13.226 --> 01:20:14.226
Mr. Weisman?

01:20:14.435 --> 01:20:15.435
Mmhmm, yes.

01:20:15.436 --> 01:20:17.196
Tell us about the film
you're going to make.

01:20:17.355 --> 01:20:18.355
Oh, sure.

01:20:18.606 --> 01:20:21.046
It's called "Charlie Chan in
London", it's a detective story.

01:20:21.234 --> 01:20:22.485
Set in London?

01:20:22.777 --> 01:20:25.863
Well, not really, most of it
takes place at a shooting party

01:20:26.155 --> 01:20:29.116
in a country house, sort of
like this one, actually.

01:20:29.408 --> 01:20:31.118
A murder in the middle of the night,

01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:33.663
a lot of guests for the
weekend, everyone's a suspect.

01:20:33.955 --> 01:20:36.332
You know? That sort of thing.

01:20:36.624 --> 01:20:37.667
How horrid.

01:20:39.001 --> 01:20:40.795
And who turns out to have done it?

01:20:41.087 --> 01:20:42.088
I couldn't tell you that.

01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:44.549
It would spoil it for you.

01:20:44.841 --> 01:20:46.801
Yeah, but none of us will see it.

01:20:47.093 --> 01:20:48.093
Aha!

01:20:52.723 --> 01:20:55.101
Isabelle? Isabelle?!

01:21:01.274 --> 01:21:02.358
Jennings?

01:21:14.954 --> 01:21:16.664
Robert Altman's film "Gosford Park"

01:21:16.956 --> 01:21:18.791
is a virtuoso ensemble piece

01:21:19.083 --> 01:21:21.377
to rival the director's
Nashville and Short Cuts,

01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:24.171
that's masterly interweaving
of multiple characters

01:21:24.463 --> 01:21:25.463
and subplots.

01:21:26.173 --> 01:21:27.413
It is a contemporary equivalent

01:21:27.633 --> 01:21:30.553
of Jean Renoir's classic
"Rules of the Game".

01:21:32.138 --> 01:21:33.898
What makes the achievement
of "Gosford Park"

01:21:34.056 --> 01:21:36.809
all the more remarkable is that Mr.
Altman is 76.

01:21:38.269 --> 01:21:40.479
But the movie's cool assessment
of the human condition

01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:43.024
implies the dispassionate overview of a man

01:21:43.316 --> 01:21:44.525
who has seen it all.

01:21:44.817 --> 01:21:46.418
The energy that crackles from the screen

01:21:46.611 --> 01:21:48.529
suggests the clear sighted joie DE vivre

01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:51.115
of an artist still deeply
engaged in the world.

01:22:00.499 --> 01:22:02.043
I had done six... seven films

01:22:02.335 --> 01:22:05.046
and I was so smug and proud of myself

01:22:05.338 --> 01:22:09.300
because I thought none of these
films are alike and then,

01:22:09.592 --> 01:22:11.969
ten... twelve films more.

01:22:12.261 --> 01:22:14.180
I look at these things and I think,

01:22:14.472 --> 01:22:19.852
hmmm, these really are all just
chapters of the same book.

01:22:20.144 --> 01:22:21.562
They're just different chapters.

01:22:27.818 --> 01:22:29.058
With "A Prairie Home Companion"

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:31.072
Bob was doing two things.

01:22:31.364 --> 01:22:34.533
Returning to his youth when
he absolutely loved radio

01:22:34.825 --> 01:22:36.661
and contemplating death.

01:22:37.244 --> 01:22:39.080
He was joining both ends of the circle.

01:22:39.372 --> 01:22:40.372
What are we doing?

01:22:40.373 --> 01:22:41.999
You're on in the power milk segment

01:22:42.291 --> 01:22:44.126
doing gold watch and chain with him.

01:22:44.418 --> 01:22:45.836

Fine, whatever you like.

01:23:09.902 --> 01:23:12.905
Well this really isn't going
to be your last show, is it?

01:23:13.197 --> 01:23:14.318
Every show's your last show.

01:23:14.573 --> 01:23:15.241
Oh my god.

01:23:15.533 --> 01:23:16.826
That's my philosophy.

01:23:17.118 --> 01:23:18.118
Thank you, Plato.

01:23:18.285 --> 01:23:25.668

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:33.426

01:23:33.718 --> 01:23:41.434

01:23:45.688 --> 01:23:47.690
A lot of people are
wondering what you meant

01:23:47.982 --> 01:23:50.943
with the end of the film when
the angel goes into the diner

01:23:51.235 --> 01:23:54.238
and a lot of people go back and
forth about what it means,

01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:55.530
what she was there for.

01:23:55.781 --> 01:24:00.286
Well I felt it was about leaving
it open who was gonna die next.

01:24:00.578 --> 01:24:05.791
Obviously, this film is
about death and, uh...

01:24:12.673 --> 01:24:17.595
She was the angel of death and
she showed up for one of them

01:24:17.887 --> 01:24:21.265
and um,

01:24:21.557 --> 01:24:25.686
we just closed the film
before we told you which one.

01:24:25.978 --> 01:24:27.063
Sort of like real life.

01:24:47.875 --> 01:24:52.088
Death is the only ending that I know about.

01:24:52.379 --> 01:24:55.382
People will come in and say oh,
does this have a happy ending?

01:24:55.674 --> 01:24:57.468
And I say well, no.

01:24:58.177 --> 01:25:00.137
But we can make a happy stopping place.

01:25:22.076 --> 01:25:23.786
Right now, I'd like to toast you all,

01:25:24.078 --> 01:25:24.495
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:25:24.787 --> 01:25:25.787
Yeah!

01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:26.830
Happy Thanksgiving!

01:25:42.638 --> 01:25:47.226
And it's a turkey that has never
been genetically encoded.

01:25:54.066 --> 01:25:56.402
Big Family gathering here tonight

01:25:56.694 --> 01:25:58.320
and makes me very weepy.

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.911
He became very enamored of his family

01:26:06.203 --> 01:26:08.706
in the last few years of his life.

01:26:08.998 --> 01:26:10.319
We would have these get togethers

01:26:10.499 --> 01:26:12.501
and I would catch him sitting in the corner

01:26:12.793 --> 01:26:15.212
just looking at everybody
with that grin on his face.

01:26:15.504 --> 01:26:17.089
It was like one of his movies.

01:26:17.381 --> 01:26:19.884
Like he became aware that
he was in his own movie.

01:26:20.176 --> 01:26:21.594
And he loved the cast.

01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:33.814
What does it mean to you?

01:26:35.232 --> 01:26:36.984
It's inspiration.

01:26:46.493 --> 01:26:51.665
Live from Hollywood it's the
78th Annual Academy Awards.

01:26:56.003 --> 01:26:57.546
Maverick filmmaker Robert Altman

01:26:57.838 --> 01:27:00.257
has been nominated five times for an Oscar

01:27:00.549 --> 01:27:01.967
without ever winning one.

01:27:02.676 --> 01:27:05.179
Today, the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences

01:27:05.471 --> 01:27:08.265
is giving Altman a
lifetime achievement award

01:27:08.557 --> 01:27:10.267
in recognition of a career

01:27:10.559 --> 01:27:12.279
that has repeatedly reinvented the art form

01:27:12.561 --> 01:27:15.022
and inspired filmmakers
and audiences alike.

01:27:45.761 --> 01:27:46.761
Thank you.

01:27:48.055 --> 01:27:52.142
No other filmmaker has gotten
a better shake than I have.

01:27:52.434 --> 01:27:54.520
I'm very fortunate in my career.

01:27:54.812 --> 01:27:58.023
I've never had to direct
a film I didn't choose.

01:27:58.315 --> 01:27:59.817
I love filmmaking.

01:28:00.109 --> 01:28:03.570
It has given me an entree to the
world and to the human condition

01:28:03.862 --> 01:28:05.823
and for that I'm forever grateful.

01:28:06.907 --> 01:28:09.743
Finally, I would like to thank my family,

01:28:10.035 --> 01:28:11.203
which are all right there.

01:28:11.495 --> 01:28:12.495
All of them.

01:28:12.496 --> 01:28:14.415
For their love and support
through the years

01:28:14.707 --> 01:28:16.125
and most importantly

01:28:16.417 --> 01:28:21.297
I want to thank and applaud
my wife Kathryn Reed Altman,

01:28:21.588 --> 01:28:24.300
without whom I wouldn't be here today.

01:28:26.427 --> 01:28:27.803
I love you.

01:28:29.631 --> 01:28:30.631
Thank you.

01:28:30.639 --> 01:28:33.183
Oh, one more thing.

01:28:34.018 --> 01:28:38.856
I'm here, I think, under false pretenses

01:28:39.148 --> 01:28:44.403
and I think I have to
become straight with you,

01:28:44.695 --> 01:28:52.328
uh, ten years ago... 11 years
ago I had a heart transplant.

01:28:52.619 --> 01:28:54.330
A total heart transplant.

01:28:54.621 --> 01:28:56.081
I got the heart of, I think,

01:28:56.373 --> 01:29:00.544
a young woman who was
about in her late 30's.

01:29:01.128 --> 01:29:04.757
And so by that kind of calculation,

01:29:05.049 --> 01:29:08.302
you may be giving me this award too early

01:29:08.594 --> 01:29:12.514
because I think I got about
40 years left on it.

01:29:13.682 --> 01:29:15.476
And I intend to use it.

01:29:15.768 --> 01:29:17.144
Thank you very much.

01:29:37.664 --> 01:29:39.666
He was in preproduction on a film called.

01:29:39.958 --> 01:29:42.086
"Hands on a Hard Body", scouting locations.

01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:45.881
He'd been diagnosed with cancer

01:29:46.173 --> 01:29:48.050
and he wanted to keep on working.

01:29:48.342 --> 01:29:49.635
Chemo or no chemo.

01:29:52.429 --> 01:29:54.014
It would have been his 40th movie.

01:30:01.897 --> 01:30:06.110
One day, years and years
ago, just after the war,

01:30:06.402 --> 01:30:08.862
Bob had nothing to do and
he went to a theater

01:30:09.154 --> 01:30:12.116
in the middle of the
afternoon to see a movie.

01:30:12.408 --> 01:30:14.785
Not a Hollywood movie, a British movie.

01:30:32.970 --> 01:30:35.431
He said the main character
was not glamorous.

01:30:35.722 --> 01:30:37.891
Not a babe, and at first he wondered

01:30:38.183 --> 01:30:39.685
why he was even watching it.

01:30:56.535 --> 01:30:59.913
But twenty minutes later he was in tears

01:31:00.205 --> 01:31:01.790
and had fallen in love with her.

01:31:09.131 --> 01:31:12.885
And it made him feel that
it wasn't just a movie.
