WEBVTT

00:15.849 --> 00:17.935
- So in addition, my client is offering

00:17.935 --> 00:20.437
the townhouse on East 63rd Street,

00:20.437 --> 00:22.689
the oceanfront estate in Farhampton,

00:22.689 --> 00:24.900
and this bottle...

00:24.900 --> 00:28.195
of 1831 single malt Glen McKenna,

00:29.071 --> 00:31.031
valued at $3 million.

00:32.241 --> 00:34.952
- I was saving this
for a special occasion.

00:34.952 --> 00:38.121
But without my Becky,
no occasion will ever be special again.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.790
- Captain...

00:39.790 --> 00:41.291
I don't want your houses.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.751
I don't want your car.

00:42.751 --> 00:43.836
I don't want your private jet.

00:43.836 --> 00:46.129
- You're having second thoughts.
Marvelous!

00:46.129 --> 00:47.631
Let's drink to celebrate.

00:48.632 --> 00:49.883
Maybe there's a bar nearby.

00:51.718 --> 00:52.845
- Captain...

00:53.929 --> 00:55.472
You broke my heart.

00:55.472 --> 00:56.974
You hit me where it hurts.

00:57.766 --> 01:00.978
So now,
I'm going to hit you where it hurts.

01:00.978 --> 01:03.856
- Oh no.
Rough seas ahead.

01:06.483 --> 01:07.985
- I only want

01:07.985 --> 01:10.112
three things.

01:10.946 --> 01:13.240
Boats, boats...

01:13.240 --> 01:15.325
- Please don't say boats.
- ...boats.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.035
- Oh god...

01:20.163 --> 01:21.582
BECKY:
That's right, Captain.

01:22.541 --> 01:24.918
I'm going to take

01:24.918 --> 01:26.962
all your boats,

01:26.962 --> 01:30.465
and I'm gonna sink 'em!

01:30.465 --> 01:33.343
Every. Last. One of them.

01:33.844 --> 01:35.971
- But, you love boats--
- I hate boats!

01:36.638 --> 01:38.223
SOPHIE'S SON :
Mom! You left the story off

01:38.223 --> 01:40.100
on you in a restaurant, being stood up.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.186
You've got to stop with this
random rich couple.

01:42.186 --> 01:44.062
- Would you trust me?

01:44.062 --> 01:46.106
They're going to come into play soon.

01:46.732 --> 01:49.484
So, I was waiting at the restaurant...

01:49.484 --> 01:51.111
- Dear god...

01:51.111 --> 01:52.738
I'm being stood up.

01:52.738 --> 01:54.364
- Sophie. Hi!

01:54.364 --> 01:56.533
- Hi.
- I am so sorry.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.660
I was on the train. I bumped
into that guy I got in a fight with.

01:58.660 --> 02:01.079
You remember the dad with
the two 5-year-old breakdancing twins?

02:01.079 --> 02:03.123
And I was like you shouldn't
make your kids perform like that,

02:03.123 --> 02:04.875
And he was like, "They love it!"
I was like, "They're 5.

02:04.875 --> 02:07.252
They'd probably also love a dad
who obeyed child labor laws."

02:07.252 --> 02:10.297
Anyway, I didn't want a repeat incident,
so I got off the train, and I ran here.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.801
Okay, listen.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.178
I wanna start this off right.

02:17.346 --> 02:18.847
I went to see Meredith earlier today.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.307
Uh, she released a single,

02:20.307 --> 02:22.434
and I kind of spun out about it,

02:22.434 --> 02:24.269
and I-I just needed some closure.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.313
I-I hope you can understand that.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.191
- Did you get the closure
you were looking for?

02:29.608 --> 02:31.109
- I did.

02:31.568 --> 02:34.112
- I'm glad.
- Me, too.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.280
- Good.

02:35.280 --> 02:38.033
We'd waited
a long time to get to this moment,

02:38.033 --> 02:39.952
so we decided to take things slow.

02:42.621 --> 02:44.206
- That was...

02:44.790 --> 02:46.917
Wow.

02:46.917 --> 02:48.418
- Yeah. Uh,

02:48.418 --> 02:51.088
I see your wow,
and I raise you a whoa.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.092
You think that Thai place delivers?

02:55.676 --> 02:56.677
- Maybe.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.721
Or we could just do that again.

03:00.472 --> 03:01.682
- Yeah. We'll eat when we're dead.

03:05.602 --> 03:08.438
- On one hand, it's the best
cardiothoracic fellowship

03:08.438 --> 03:09.982
in the country, and I got a spot.

03:09.982 --> 03:10.983
- Of course you did, Hannah.

03:10.983 --> 03:13.110
You're like the ideal
cardiothoracic fellow.

03:13.110 --> 03:15.696
Sometimes, I want to puncture
my own lung just so you can fix it.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.948
- But it means another year
of long distance.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.616
- Year-schmear!

03:19.616 --> 03:22.703
It's this ad I saw for the cream-cheese-of
- the-month club, but it applies here, too.

03:22.703 --> 03:23.704
Hannah...

03:24.955 --> 03:26.206
There's only one thing to do.

03:27.124 --> 03:29.459
We've got to become
a bicoastal power couple.

03:29.918 --> 03:33.714
We are going to scrimp and save, so we
can visit each other a lot more often,

03:33.714 --> 03:36.633
and we've got the best of both coasts.

03:36.633 --> 03:39.219
Bagels and burritos, baby.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.888
- I do like the sound of that.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.807
You always know just what to say.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.478
- You wanna go do it bicoastal style?

03:48.478 --> 03:50.189
- What's bicoastal style?

03:50.606 --> 03:53.525
- I'm not sure, but I've got an image
of you in a bikini top

03:53.525 --> 03:55.360
and me wearing mittens.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.945
- Ooh!

04:06.121 --> 04:07.873
- Ellen, where have you been?

04:07.873 --> 04:09.499
I can't sleep. I need you to do that thing

04:09.499 --> 04:11.084
where you scratch my back
and sing Enya to me.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.669
And why do you have a cat?

04:13.212 --> 04:15.923
- Well, first I had
my interview at Goliath Market,

04:15.923 --> 04:17.799
which did not go well.

04:17.799 --> 04:19.301
- Ellen, hi.
- Hi.

04:19.301 --> 04:21.720
- I'm Mark, the lead producer buyer.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.138
- Lead produce buyer?

04:23.138 --> 04:26.683
So, you're like the... head of lettuce.

04:28.977 --> 04:32.439
Y-you know, the head of lettuce?

04:33.148 --> 04:35.317
- I'm sorry, I don't follow.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.403
- Th-the head of--

04:39.321 --> 04:42.950
After my interview, I went on OkCupid
'cause I thought a date might cheer me up,

04:42.950 --> 04:44.952
but the woman showed up with her husband.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.079
And then I realized
that I had set my settings to

04:47.079 --> 04:49.206
"couples only" for months.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.376
When I finally got home,

04:52.376 --> 04:54.419
I found this little lady
outside the building.

04:54.878 --> 04:57.381
Think she's exactly what I need right now.

04:57.381 --> 04:58.841
An emotional support animal.

04:58.841 --> 05:01.301
Look at us.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.054
We're totally bonding.

05:06.348 --> 05:07.683
- Had something of a night myself.

05:07.683 --> 05:10.352
Valentina let slip
that she wants kids someday.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.354
And I absolutely do not.

05:12.354 --> 05:13.772
- Really?

05:13.772 --> 05:16.275
But, you're a bossy narcissist
with a sentimental streak.

05:16.275 --> 05:18.569
- I know. I mean, on paper,
I'm a born parent.

05:18.569 --> 05:20.821
It's just...

05:20.821 --> 05:24.116
Having children turned my mother
into a mean, spiteful woman,

05:24.116 --> 05:25.993
and I want to be kind and generous

05:25.993 --> 05:29.288
and not the sort of person who throws
jewelry at their children in a fit of rage

05:29.288 --> 05:32.207
whenever the Duchess of Cornwall
cancels tea time.

05:32.207 --> 05:35.586
- Charlie, you and Valentina are still
a very new relationship.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.505
Valentina's nowhere near
ready to have a baby.

05:38.505 --> 05:41.133
- Hi, Ellen. How'd the interview--

05:41.133 --> 05:43.719
Kitty!

05:43.719 --> 05:46.013
Oh hi, little baby!

05:47.556 --> 05:49.224
Aw...

05:49.224 --> 05:51.852
Mama loves you. Yeah.

05:54.229 --> 05:57.065
SOPHIE'S MOM:
We fell asleep after an amazing night,

05:57.065 --> 05:59.860
and all felt right with the world,

05:59.860 --> 06:02.112
until...
- I love you, Sophie.

06:19.588 --> 06:20.839
- Hey, you.
- Ah!

06:21.298 --> 06:22.591
I mean...

06:23.467 --> 06:25.135
hey!

06:25.135 --> 06:27.137
- Last night was pretty great, huh?

06:27.638 --> 06:30.265
I mean, two times?
What are we, porn stars?

06:31.767 --> 06:34.728
I think keeping the laptop off
my crotch has really paid off.

06:35.854 --> 06:37.272
FUTURE SOPHIE:
Son, I'm not proud of this,

06:37.272 --> 06:39.149
but I wasn't used to guys

06:39.149 --> 06:41.693
wearing their hearts on their sleeves,

06:41.693 --> 06:43.529
and it freaked me the F out.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.072
- You gotta go now.

06:45.781 --> 06:48.242
I mean, I've got to...

06:48.242 --> 06:49.910
start getting ready for my gallery show.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.787
- Really? Already?
- Mm-hmm.

06:51.787 --> 06:53.205
- It's not for, like, 10 hours.

06:53.205 --> 06:55.415
- Yeah. But then, I--
You know, I gotta shower.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.167
And then another shower,

06:57.167 --> 06:58.752
and maybe squeeze in one more shower.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.171
One thing you're going to learn
about me is I love showers.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.590
- Uh, okay.
- Tata for now!

07:05.717 --> 07:06.927
- Wow.

07:07.970 --> 07:10.138
All turned around
from two times with Jesse.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.768
- Wow. I have never planned two
weddings for one couple before.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.812
Love the Pinterest board
you sent over, by the way.

07:16.812 --> 07:19.731
- Yeah! Dope boards, huh? You like
the rustic chalkboard table signs?

07:19.731 --> 07:21.650
- Truly inspired.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.652
I've never seen anything like it before.

07:24.736 --> 07:27.364
Anyway, here's what I think
we're looking at price-wise

07:27.364 --> 07:29.199
for the New York wedding.
Okay.

07:31.618 --> 07:35.038
- Uh... I had to move my head
to get to the end of this number, Lisa.

07:35.038 --> 07:36.623
This is too long of a number.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.586
- And here's what I think we're looking
at for the Indian wedding.

07:41.879 --> 07:44.506
- Oh my god, you better
tell me that's in rupees!

07:44.506 --> 07:46.633
- What did you think
this was going to cost?

07:46.633 --> 07:48.385
You're supposed to enter on a white horse.

07:48.385 --> 07:51.513
- I can get you a great deal
on a white horse. Do not ask me how.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.433
Okay, you can ask me how.

07:54.433 --> 07:55.767
- How?
- How?

07:56.226 --> 07:57.227
You've heard of Tiger King?

07:57.227 --> 07:58.478
Yeah.
- Well,

07:58.478 --> 08:00.522
I am in an on-again,
off-again relationship

08:00.522 --> 08:01.899
with the White Horse King.

08:01.899 --> 08:04.318
And right now, we are on, baby.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.907
- She fits perfectly in my arms.

08:10.365 --> 08:12.618
It's like they were made for you...

08:12.618 --> 08:14.161
- Oh god.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.413
- I also just...

08:17.706 --> 08:20.918
adore her.

08:20.918 --> 08:21.919
Achoo! Achoo! Achoo!
- Whoa!

08:23.337 --> 08:25.339
- I can't take this anymore. Valentina...

08:26.089 --> 08:28.091
I don't want kids, okay?

08:28.759 --> 08:31.178
Not now. Not ever.

08:31.887 --> 08:34.181
- Uh... What?
- Yesterday, you said, "One day,

08:34.181 --> 08:36.225
we'd watch soccer
with our future children," and I...

08:37.142 --> 08:39.645
care about you too much
to not be honest with you.

08:40.771 --> 08:42.606
I'm never going to want children.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.108
- Oh.

08:46.276 --> 08:47.694
Got it.

08:50.948 --> 08:52.783
- Claw-kward.

08:54.535 --> 08:58.330
- I don't understand why you're
suddenly freaking out about costs!

08:58.330 --> 09:01.291
You're the one who wanted
a second international wedding.

09:01.291 --> 09:04.336
- Yeah, when I thought our lives were
about to get way less expensive.

09:04.336 --> 09:07.464
Like, Hannah, I thought, we were gonna
live in one city and share one apartment,

09:07.464 --> 09:09.716
not constantly be flying
across the country

09:09.716 --> 09:12.886
to maintain some semblance
of a relationship.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.306
- What happened to us being
a bicoastal power couple?

09:16.306 --> 09:17.933
- Hannah, what do you want me to say?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.185
Babe, I support you,

09:20.185 --> 09:23.146
but we both know doing this
for another year, it's--

09:23.146 --> 09:24.356
it sounds hard as hell.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.237
- Sounds like you're not
even sure we should be planning

09:30.237 --> 09:32.239
one wedding, let alone two.

09:36.368 --> 09:37.870
- Bad news.

09:37.870 --> 09:40.831
Me and the White Horse King are off again.

09:40.831 --> 09:42.833
We're off.

09:43.709 --> 09:46.587
I showed up at the guys'
apartment before my gallery show,

09:46.587 --> 09:49.464
determined to talk about
the sleep "I love you"

09:49.464 --> 09:51.175
and move past it.

09:51.633 --> 09:54.803
After all, he was pretty damn cute.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.889
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:03.187 --> 10:06.440
- I, uh, I took the liberty of...

10:06.440 --> 10:08.150
making you a peach margarita.

10:08.150 --> 10:10.485
I even hand-muddled the peaches myself.
- Hm.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.237
- That's right. I muddle.

10:17.034 --> 10:19.912
- Mm!
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.334
Jesse, last night, something...

10:26.293 --> 10:29.171
funny happened,
and it's no big deal.

10:29.171 --> 10:31.924
It-it kinda freaked me out,
and I just wanted to talk about it.

10:31.924 --> 10:34.384
- Okay, I'm not normally
completely hairless down there.

10:34.384 --> 10:37.012
It's just I was listening to
a podcast while I was manscaping,

10:37.012 --> 10:39.389
and I just completely lost track
of what I was doing.

10:39.389 --> 10:40.849
- No, not that.

10:40.849 --> 10:42.601
Although, I, uh, was wondering.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.231
Last night in your sleep, you...

10:48.190 --> 10:49.650
told me you loved me.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.777
- Oh god. I did?

10:53.237 --> 10:56.365
This is worse than when I sleep-sang
Tradition from Fiddler on the Roof

10:56.365 --> 10:58.242
at overnight camp.

10:58.242 --> 11:01.078
In case you're wondering,
I remained a virgin that summer.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.957
- God, I already feel
better that we're talking,

11:04.957 --> 11:07.668
and we could just laugh
about this together.

11:07.668 --> 11:10.128
Me first. Ha! That was so crazy!

11:12.965 --> 11:14.925
- I mean, it's not that crazy.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.095
Well, it's not like we're two
strangers who just met at a bar.

11:18.095 --> 11:19.888
We've been friends for a while now.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.640
We've built a solid foundation.

11:21.640 --> 11:24.059
I even said no to going on tour
with Meredith for you.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.020
- You did what?
- Oh yeah.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.565
Meredith wanted me
to play piano for her on tour.

11:29.565 --> 11:31.400
She also basically said
she wanted to get back together,

11:31.400 --> 11:34.778
and both of those things would have been
a dream come true a few weeks ago, but...

11:35.487 --> 11:37.406
Hey, I-I didn't even give it
a second thought because...

11:38.073 --> 11:39.616
I'm crazy about you.

11:42.244 --> 11:43.745
- Jesse, I...

11:45.080 --> 11:46.123
I like you, too.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.710
It...

11:49.710 --> 11:52.921
It's kind of a lot to hear
that you gave up going on tour for me

11:52.921 --> 11:54.840
because it's what
you always dreamed of doing.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.758
- So-so...

11:56.758 --> 11:58.552
what are you saying?
You think I should have gone?

11:59.970 --> 12:02.514
- I don't know. Maybe.

12:03.849 --> 12:06.435
If you only said no for me,

12:06.435 --> 12:08.520
and this is brand new. I mean,

12:08.520 --> 12:10.355
we don't even know
if this is going to work out.

12:10.939 --> 12:12.441
- Got it. Uh...

12:13.233 --> 12:16.028
So, you think I should
go on tour with my ex.

12:17.112 --> 12:19.156
I read you loud and clear, Sophie.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.204
- I-I don't know what to say.

12:25.204 --> 12:27.873
- Uh, I do. I-I'd like you to go.

12:29.750 --> 12:30.792
Please.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.879
FUTURE SOPHIE:
I had no idea what to do.

12:33.879 --> 12:36.256
I mean, part of me
wanted to run back in there

12:36.256 --> 12:39.051
and to tell him that
I had made a huge mistake.

12:39.051 --> 12:40.761
But the other part of me

12:40.761 --> 12:43.305
wanted to run as far as humanly possible.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.433
I decided to split the difference

12:46.433 --> 12:48.477
and go to the bar downstairs

12:48.477 --> 12:49.978
to clear my head.

12:52.898 --> 12:54.274
- Hm.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.527
This is what this place looks like.

12:57.069 --> 12:58.695
Weird we never come in here.

13:00.948 --> 13:03.742
Uh, one whiskey, please.

13:03.742 --> 13:05.661
Up, neat, and on the rocks.

13:06.912 --> 13:09.331
- That is not an order that makes sense.

13:09.331 --> 13:11.124
- Oh.

13:11.124 --> 13:14.419
Yeah, I-I don't actually know
how to order whiskey.

13:14.419 --> 13:17.256
It's just been a day, and...

13:17.256 --> 13:18.298
it seems like the kind of thing

13:18.298 --> 13:20.133
that people order
when they're feeling a little extra--

13:20.133 --> 13:21.677
WOMAN:
Good extra or bad extra?

13:27.224 --> 13:28.225
- Oh my god.

13:29.184 --> 13:30.519
Robin Scherbatsky?

13:31.353 --> 13:33.272
I know you from the news.

13:33.272 --> 13:35.524
- Hear that, Carl?
She's a fan.

13:35.524 --> 13:36.900
I have fans.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.111
- Yeah, most famous people
don't go around saying,

13:39.111 --> 13:40.779
"I have fans," but okay.

13:40.779 --> 13:43.282
- What was that, Carl? I didn't hear you.
I was focused on my fan.

13:44.992 --> 13:48.912
- I mean, seriously, my friend Valentina
and I are obsessed with you.

13:48.912 --> 13:51.164
I remember th-the story
you did on the bullfighters,

13:51.164 --> 13:53.333
where you actually
got in the ring and got...

13:53.333 --> 13:54.835
Gored by a bull.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.421
- I loved that so much.

13:58.088 --> 14:00.132
- You're kind of a mean fan, huh?

14:00.132 --> 14:03.927
- No! No, no.
Seriously, it was so bad-ass.

14:03.927 --> 14:05.846
- Well, it was bad for my ass.

14:05.846 --> 14:07.931
The ER doc in Seville spent six hours

14:07.931 --> 14:10.642
tweezing bullhorn fragments
from my left butt cheek.

14:10.642 --> 14:12.019
But, uh, back to you.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.854
Was today "good" extra

14:13.854 --> 14:16.940
or "bullhorn to the ass" extra?

14:16.940 --> 14:18.400
- Really?

14:18.400 --> 14:20.277
A big famous reporter

14:20.277 --> 14:22.696
wants to hear about my stupid love life?

14:22.696 --> 14:25.282
- Very, very much, actually.

14:26.200 --> 14:29.494
Back in the day, my friends
and I wasted years in this very bar,

14:29.494 --> 14:32.372
talking about our stupid love lives.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.458
I stop in here whenever
I'm in the neighborhood.

14:34.458 --> 14:36.376
- Hm.
- So,

14:36.376 --> 14:39.171
please tell me your stupid love story.

14:39.796 --> 14:41.798
Bring me back to the good old days.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.344
- Okay. Well...

14:46.220 --> 14:48.013
It all started in the back of an Uber.

14:48.013 --> 14:49.515
- Nice.

14:49.515 --> 14:50.766
- Not like that.

14:50.766 --> 14:52.142
- Boo.

14:53.727 --> 14:56.188
- I-I'm surprised that you're
so gung ho about this.

14:56.188 --> 14:58.398
I'd assumed that we were on the same page.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.777
- I know kids seem
very off brand for me, but...

15:02.986 --> 15:04.488
I want it all.

15:05.072 --> 15:06.365
A big career,

15:06.365 --> 15:07.699
a big love story,

15:07.699 --> 15:09.701
and a big family.

15:10.911 --> 15:12.412
You really...

15:12.412 --> 15:14.957
don't think you'll change your mind?

15:16.959 --> 15:18.460
- I don't think so.

15:20.504 --> 15:21.588
You?

15:24.007 --> 15:25.968
- I don't think so.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.598
- She just reached under my bra
and scratched my nipple.

15:31.598 --> 15:35.185
I think I'm in an abusive relationship
with my emotional support animal.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.729
- Maybe you guys just need
more time to bond.

15:37.729 --> 15:38.939
- No.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.232
Time won't help.

15:40.232 --> 15:42.150
Time hasn't helped my dating life.

15:42.150 --> 15:43.861
It hasn't helped my job search.

15:43.861 --> 15:47.155
It's not gonna help my relationship
with this feral cat.

15:47.155 --> 15:49.575
Nothing is coming up Ellen.

15:49.575 --> 15:51.910
Say goodbye to Kate Meow-Kinnon, everyone.

15:55.414 --> 15:58.125
Rachel?
- Oh, perfect.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.752
It's the girl who pretended to be
my dead grandma's best friend

16:00.752 --> 16:02.337
to try to get in my pants.

16:02.337 --> 16:03.839
- Oh...

16:03.839 --> 16:06.675
Just Ellen is fine.

16:08.177 --> 16:09.553
Is everything okay?

16:09.553 --> 16:11.221
- No.

16:11.221 --> 16:13.765
I was moving into
my grandma's apartment yesterday,

16:13.765 --> 16:16.310
and somehow, in all the craziness,

16:16.310 --> 16:17.811
my cat went missing.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.021
- I'm your cat!

16:20.189 --> 16:22.733
Sorry. I got too excited
and I tanked that.

16:22.733 --> 16:25.611
But, I think...

16:25.611 --> 16:27.738
I found your cat
wandering outside last night.

16:27.738 --> 16:29.448
- Oh my god,

16:29.448 --> 16:32.367
my sweet baby!

16:32.367 --> 16:34.369
Aw, you found Cal!

16:35.245 --> 16:38.040
So, you took care of her last night?

16:38.040 --> 16:39.416
- Yeah. I...

16:40.209 --> 16:42.503
Thought she could be
my emotional support cat, but...

16:43.212 --> 16:44.505
She hates me.

16:45.923 --> 16:48.634
So, you two have that in common.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.471
- I don't hate you, Ellen.

16:52.846 --> 16:56.725
You just made a really
insane first impression.

16:58.560 --> 17:01.313
But maybe we deserve a second chance.

17:02.564 --> 17:03.440
- Achoo!

17:04.566 --> 17:05.859
Oh...

17:08.237 --> 17:11.281
How about a third chance?

17:12.115 --> 17:14.243
- Okay, just so I'm clear,

17:14.243 --> 17:17.621
you were really excited
to try being with this guy Jesse.

17:18.163 --> 17:21.124
Right? But now that he's all in,
you're not excited.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.752
- Kind of. Uh...

17:24.294 --> 17:26.463
We just got together, and now,

17:26.463 --> 17:28.632
he's turning down tours for me

17:28.632 --> 17:31.009
and dropping sleep "I love you's"?

17:31.009 --> 17:33.011
Like, it's too much too soon.

17:33.846 --> 17:36.890
- I once had a guy say,
"I love you," on our first date.

17:37.432 --> 17:39.434
- Wow. You win.

17:40.018 --> 17:41.353
Dude sounds like a real piece of work.

17:41.353 --> 17:43.355
- You have no idea.

17:44.273 --> 17:46.191
But, a good piece of work.

17:46.817 --> 17:49.236
Which brings me to my advice.

17:51.029 --> 17:53.365
Do not waste your time
being scared, Sophie.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.326
Fear can make you run away from things

17:56.326 --> 17:58.620
that could be good, great even.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.622
Things that are supposed
to be a part of your story.

18:00.622 --> 18:03.083
So, really think about it.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.793
What did Jesse do wrong

18:04.793 --> 18:08.046
other than say everything
you ever wanted a guy to say

18:08.046 --> 18:10.966
just faster than you expected?

18:13.552 --> 18:14.595
- Nothing.

18:15.888 --> 18:17.389
He did nothing wrong.

18:18.557 --> 18:20.058
I'm just...

18:21.602 --> 18:23.395
scared.
- There it is.

18:25.731 --> 18:28.317
Sophie, I have been married,
I've been single,

18:28.317 --> 18:30.444
I have been everything in between.

18:31.486 --> 18:33.488
And the only decisions I regret making

18:33.488 --> 18:35.490
are the ones I made out of fear.

18:36.241 --> 18:37.993
So do me a favor, okay?

18:37.993 --> 18:40.746
Time travel 20 years into the future

18:40.746 --> 18:43.665
and ask future you, "Future me,

18:43.665 --> 18:45.584
"what do I wish I'd done 20 years ago,

18:45.584 --> 18:47.336
"the night I met smoking hot,

18:47.336 --> 18:49.421
"yet somehow still full of gravitas,

18:49.421 --> 18:52.090
news superstar Robin Scherbatsky?"

18:52.674 --> 18:55.260
And whatever future you says,

18:55.260 --> 18:56.595
do that.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.181
- Okay.

18:59.890 --> 19:01.767
I've got to go talk to Jesse!

19:02.809 --> 19:05.979
You know, the-the truth is
my feelings about love

19:05.979 --> 19:08.482
are complicated
because I never knew my dad,

19:08.482 --> 19:10.317
and my mom's relationships were a mess.

19:10.317 --> 19:13.070
- Yeah, maybe save unpacking
your whole childhood for Jesse.

19:13.070 --> 19:14.947
I have a limo picking me up in 10.

19:15.531 --> 19:17.407
- Yeah. Save it for Jesse. Okay.

19:17.407 --> 19:18.825
Robin, thank you.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.118
- Good luck.

19:50.899 --> 19:52.568
- I went to talk to Jesse...

19:52.568 --> 19:54.194
- No need to thank me. Just, you know,

19:54.194 --> 19:56.238
name your first born Robin.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.782
- And I-I walked in
on him with this ex.

19:59.867 --> 20:01.660
- Well, I was more helping
you get to the place

20:01.660 --> 20:03.829
where you made that decision, so...

20:05.038 --> 20:06.707
Y... Maybe,

20:06.707 --> 20:09.668
he's not such a bad guy, this Jesse.

20:09.668 --> 20:12.045
If I've learned
anything at all about love,

20:12.045 --> 20:14.047
it's that timing is everything.

20:14.840 --> 20:17.968
And sometimes, timing's a bitch.

20:19.761 --> 20:21.221
Speaking of, I'm sorry,

20:21.221 --> 20:24.224
but I have a dinner with, uh,
Savannah Guthrie and Katie Couric.

20:28.353 --> 20:30.731
You're gonna be okay.
- You promise?

20:30.731 --> 20:32.399
- I do.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.651
But, I'll meet future you
back here in 20 years

20:34.651 --> 20:36.403
for a drink just to make sure.

20:37.905 --> 20:39.406
- It's a date.
- Good.

20:39.948 --> 20:42.659
But that one's on you.
Mama's not made of money.

20:46.371 --> 20:48.957
FUTURE SOPHIE:
And so, I headed to the exhibition

20:48.957 --> 20:52.419
to see one of my photos hanging
in a real New York gallery

20:52.419 --> 20:53.962
for the very first time.

20:54.630 --> 20:56.423
I was determined to enjoy my moment

20:56.423 --> 20:59.510
and forget about
any boy drama for the night.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.597
Easier said than done.

21:08.519 --> 21:11.480
- Ms. Tompkins, is that you?

21:11.480 --> 21:13.565
- Oh my god. It is you.

21:13.565 --> 21:15.275
You are, like, my favorite photographer.

21:16.485 --> 21:18.904
I'm so proud of you!

21:18.904 --> 21:20.906
- Guys, thank you for coming.

21:26.245 --> 21:28.455
- What's... What's going on with you?

21:30.207 --> 21:32.000
- Okay, fine. I have a date

21:32.000 --> 21:35.587
with the most beautiful girl
in the whole world.

21:35.587 --> 21:36.630
And that's not all.

21:44.388 --> 21:46.098
Hello?
- Ellen.

21:46.098 --> 21:48.141
It's Marc from Goliath Market.

21:48.141 --> 21:49.810
I just got your joke.

21:50.394 --> 21:52.437
I'm the head of lettuce.

21:54.022 --> 21:55.566
You're hilarious.

21:55.566 --> 21:57.359
I'm offering you the job.

21:57.359 --> 21:59.278
- Oh my god! Congrats!

21:59.278 --> 22:01.905
- Thank you! Thank you.

22:03.073 --> 22:06.243
I bet I'm the most successful lesbian
named Ellen in the whole world.

22:07.494 --> 22:08.704
Oh.

22:09.413 --> 22:11.373
- There she is! Lady of the hour.

22:11.373 --> 22:13.250
- Oh, you guys. Thank you for coming.

22:13.250 --> 22:15.460
I know you're just slammed
with wedding planning.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.171
- Oh, uh, actually,

22:17.171 --> 22:19.214
we are not slammed anymore.

22:20.299 --> 22:22.050
Wide open, actually.

22:24.094 --> 22:26.305
- Because we're married!
- Oh!

22:32.311 --> 22:34.730
- Oh, thank you!
- Congrats!

22:34.730 --> 22:37.733
- Thanks. The weddings were just getting
so stressful and expensive.

22:37.733 --> 22:40.068
We were like, you know what?
Let's just go to City Hall, get it done.

22:40.068 --> 22:41.904
- Well, I think this calls
for a toast, hm?

22:46.950 --> 22:49.995
- Hey, where's your muse, by the way?

22:50.913 --> 22:52.831
- He's...

22:52.831 --> 22:55.250
he's not coming.

22:55.250 --> 22:57.961
- Soph, what happened?
- Um...

22:59.296 --> 23:00.714
Not tonight.

23:02.674 --> 23:05.177
Sid and Hannah look so happy.

23:06.803 --> 23:08.764
Who knows?
Maybe you and Charlie are next.

23:11.433 --> 23:12.935
- Um...

23:13.852 --> 23:15.479
I don't think so. Um...

23:18.398 --> 23:19.650
We broke up.

23:20.108 --> 23:22.361
- Oh, Val...
- Not tonight.

23:22.361 --> 23:25.364
Tonight, we celebrate my friend Sophie,

23:25.364 --> 23:28.659
the most talented
photographer in New York City.

23:37.292 --> 23:40.754
- So, let's get back to those rich
strangers going through a divorce.

23:40.754 --> 23:42.089
SOPHIE'S SON:
What? No!

23:42.089 --> 23:44.883
This is not a good time
to return to those boat freaks!

23:44.883 --> 23:46.301
- Oh, you're wrong.

23:46.301 --> 23:48.262
It's the perfect time.

23:48.262 --> 23:50.889
And as Robin Scherbatsky taught me,

23:50.889 --> 23:52.808
timing is everything.

23:52.808 --> 23:54.852
- I hate boats!

23:55.435 --> 23:57.938
- I haven't hurt this bad since
someone stole that pineapple

23:57.938 --> 24:00.607
off my front doorstep in aught five.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.067
Oh, fine.

24:02.568 --> 24:04.027
You can have all the boats,

24:04.027 --> 24:07.447
but not the one in Australia.

24:07.447 --> 24:10.659
What those marine biologists
are doing down there is important!

24:11.201 --> 24:13.579
They're trying to help
coral reef procreate.

24:13.579 --> 24:16.373
SOPHIE'S SON: Oh my god.
So, the Captain owned the boat that--

24:16.373 --> 24:18.584
- That's right.
- So, what happened?

24:18.584 --> 24:20.335
Did Becky let them continue the mission?

24:26.592 --> 24:29.344
- Weird. That guy...

24:29.344 --> 24:30.971
looks just like...

24:31.805 --> 24:33.807
FUTURE SOPHIE:
No, she did not.

24:33.807 --> 24:34.975
- Ian.

24:46.695 --> 24:48.322
Hi.
- Hi.

24:49.239 --> 24:51.241
Is this a good time?
