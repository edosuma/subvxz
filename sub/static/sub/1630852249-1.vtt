WEBVTT

00:04.080 --> 00:07.160
ANNOUNCER: Collect your luggage
on platform three.

00:11.400 --> 00:12.760
LAUGHTER

00:13.920 --> 00:16.600
Come on, slowcoach.
We won't get a seat with Sally.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.640
Hang on, hang on, just a mo!

00:18.640 --> 00:21.240
Darrell, I saved you a seat.

00:21.240 --> 00:24.080
Come on you, three!
The bus is waiting.

00:24.080 --> 00:25.560
Oh!

00:25.560 --> 00:27.880
I'm so sorry! Are you all right?

00:27.880 --> 00:29.760
Here, please, let me help.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.160
Oh, dear.

00:32.480 --> 00:35.400
Go. Just...go.

00:35.400 --> 00:38.320
I'm so sorry, really.
Is that his teddy bear?!

00:39.760 --> 00:41.600
THEY LAUGH

00:43.280 --> 00:45.920
There you are, Gwen.
Did you have a smashing hols?

00:45.920 --> 00:48.240
How kind of you to ask.
I did, thank you.

00:48.240 --> 00:51.080
Look who I was sat with
on the train - Ellen Wilson,

00:51.080 --> 00:53.160
meet Darrell Rivers,
our form hothead.

00:53.160 --> 00:55.920
Darrell, this is the new
scholarship girl.

00:55.920 --> 00:58.480
Um, just the new girl's fine.
A scholarship?

00:58.480 --> 01:00.920
That's great news. We need someone
clever to up our game.

01:00.920 --> 01:02.880
Welcome to the second form.

01:03.920 --> 01:06.680
This is Irene, our scatterbrain.

01:06.680 --> 01:08.400
Hello.

01:06.680 --> 01:08.400
THEY CHUCKLE

01:08.400 --> 01:11.400
This is Jean, our good egg. Charmed.

01:11.400 --> 01:14.000
And that's Sally.
She's our bossy boots.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.440
Lovely to meet you.

01:15.440 --> 01:17.920
And Mary-Lou, our scaredy cat.

01:17.920 --> 01:20.400
NERVOUSLY: Please don't
call me that, Gwen.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.600
Well, what would you call yourself?

01:22.600 --> 01:25.040
Mary-Lou is our courage mouse.

01:28.040 --> 01:30.120
Ah, Sally, there you are.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.960
I expect Gwen's told you
she's the form princess.

01:35.960 --> 01:38.080
Thank you, Jean.

01:38.080 --> 01:41.600
Don't let Gwen use you for your
brains. Especially not Latin.

01:41.600 --> 01:45.600
I haven't studied Latin.
I've a lot to catch up on.

01:45.600 --> 01:48.720
Oh, dear. Help me with my things,
won't you?

01:50.600 --> 01:52.680
Sorry, Gwen. Ow!

01:52.680 --> 01:55.800
I told you she's rough.
Be careful of her.

01:55.800 --> 01:57.720
Ow!

01:57.720 --> 01:59.840
ENGINE STARTS

01:57.720 --> 01:59.840
Hooray!

01:59.840 --> 02:01.080
THEY CHEER

02:04.920 --> 02:07.960
I can see the school!
Oh, it's magnificent!

02:33.400 --> 02:35.320
THEY SING

02:39.280 --> 02:41.040
THEY CHEER

02:43.160 --> 02:44.960
ALL: Hip-hip hooray!

02:49.560 --> 02:51.000
Here we are!

02:51.000 --> 02:54.240
Look, Ellen, it's Malory Towers.
Do you like it?

02:54.240 --> 02:57.240
I can't believe I'm really here!

02:57.240 --> 02:59.200
Darrell, sit next to me in class?

02:59.200 --> 03:01.400
Let's bagsy next-door beds, too.

03:01.400 --> 03:04.640
I simply loved the hols, but I'm
so glad to be back. Darrell!

03:04.640 --> 03:07.200
Hi! Alicia!

03:07.200 --> 03:09.920
It's super to see you! Betty's left,
can you believe it?

03:09.920 --> 03:11.920
Upside is we can spend much
more time together.

03:11.920 --> 03:14.440
Come on! Hang on. Sally and I... Oh.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.000
As your new best friend,
we really must do something

03:22.000 --> 03:24.360
about that dress, Ellen,
it swamps you.

03:24.360 --> 03:26.400
We bought it to last.

03:26.400 --> 03:29.160
Well, it does you no favours.

03:29.160 --> 03:32.080
Oh, thanks. You're welcome.

03:32.080 --> 03:35.400
Good friends speak the truth,
even if it's not nice.

03:43.400 --> 03:46.440
That's the head, Miss Grayling.
She's frightfully stern.

03:46.440 --> 03:48.920
Don't listen to her. Firm, but fair.

03:48.920 --> 03:51.240
Find a seat. Anywhere for now.

03:56.480 --> 04:00.720
Welcome back, girls, and a warm
welcome to our new girl,

04:00.720 --> 04:02.120
Ellen Wilson.

04:03.880 --> 04:05.880
And to your new form teacher.

04:05.880 --> 04:08.240
Here he is - Mr Parker.

04:08.240 --> 04:09.720
Good morning, girls.

04:09.720 --> 04:11.600
ALL: Good morning, Mr Parker.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.200
THEY LAUGH

04:13.200 --> 04:15.600
He's the one with the teddy bear!
LAUGHTER

04:19.440 --> 04:22.440
What has got into you, girls?

04:22.440 --> 04:23.880
Welcome aboard.

04:26.960 --> 04:29.440
As you know, we will start the term
with a vote

04:29.440 --> 04:31.520
for the new head of form.

04:31.520 --> 04:36.400
Mr Parker, can you remind us of
her duties and her privileges?

04:36.400 --> 04:37.760
Um...

04:37.760 --> 04:41.480
Collecting subs, an ability
to give out order marks,

04:41.480 --> 04:43.640
time off sports for
school council meetings.

04:43.640 --> 04:46.280
May people nominate themselves?

04:46.280 --> 04:49.120
They may, but each nominee
must also be seconded.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.600
There must be three candidates.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.720
They will give speeches,
then the whole form

04:52.720 --> 04:54.280
and teaching staff vote.

04:54.280 --> 04:56.640
Choose wisely, girls.

04:56.640 --> 05:00.840
The person you choose to lead you
will shape the group you become.

05:01.840 --> 05:03.240
Don't be nervous.

05:03.240 --> 05:06.440
I promise, their bark is worse
than their bite.

05:08.520 --> 05:10.000
LAUGHTER AND CHATTING

05:10.000 --> 05:11.680
Ahem!

05:13.120 --> 05:15.000
Order! Order!

05:19.320 --> 05:21.640
LOUD RINGING

05:24.680 --> 05:28.840
Thank you. Nominations, please.
Introduce yourself when you speak.

05:28.840 --> 05:32.240
Gwendoline Mary Lacey. I'd like
to nominate myself, please.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.680
WHISPERS: She just wants
to miss swimming.

05:34.680 --> 05:37.480
And, um, Ellen Wilson.
She's my seconder.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.360
Unbelievable.

05:42.360 --> 05:44.840
Er, you, in the pigtails.

05:44.840 --> 05:47.040
Irene Edwards, and I nominate
Alicia Johns.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.720
And does Alicia have a seconder?

05:49.720 --> 05:50.960
Go on.

05:52.440 --> 05:54.520
June Dunlop. I'll second her.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.680
And we have one more.

06:04.880 --> 06:07.640
Sally Hope. I'm nominating
Darrell Rivers.

06:07.640 --> 06:09.360
But I was going to nominate you.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.520
WHISPERS: I got there first.

06:11.520 --> 06:13.600
I'll second Darrell.

06:13.600 --> 06:16.400
Sorry. I'm Mary-Lou Linnett.

06:16.400 --> 06:19.680
So, we have Gwendoline Lacey...

06:19.680 --> 06:21.440
Gwendoline Mary Lacey.

06:21.440 --> 06:25.960
Alicia Johns and Darrell Rivers
in the running.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.560
I look forward to hearing
your speeches, girls.

06:29.560 --> 06:31.800
THEY CHAT

06:37.880 --> 06:41.600
Shame we're up against one another.
Don't hold it against me, will you?

06:41.600 --> 06:44.400
What? When I win. I probably will.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.480
I've been here the longest.

06:46.480 --> 06:48.440
That's just how it works.

06:51.080 --> 06:54.200
She's wrong, you know.
You're utterly in with a chance.

07:16.520 --> 07:19.760
Ellen, where is your trunk? Um...

07:21.320 --> 07:25.920
I couldn't order one in time
and Auntie needed hers.

07:25.920 --> 07:28.800
Come along, you two.
You'll miss your chance to swim.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.960
Swim?

07:30.960 --> 07:33.960
You must be the new girl.
Ellen, is it?

07:33.960 --> 07:37.520
You can call me Matron.
Yes...Matron.

07:37.520 --> 07:42.200
Well, now, we have a pool here,
Malory Towers,

07:42.200 --> 07:44.960
so early birds can have
a dip before breakfast

07:44.960 --> 07:48.320
and then you'll eat in the dining
hall and it's straight to class

07:48.320 --> 07:52.080
spick and span. Where is Gwendoline
Mary Lacey? Her bed is a mess.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.320
Hey, Matron.

07:54.560 --> 07:58.680
I got up early this morning,
and I thought you might like these.

07:59.840 --> 08:03.320
How very kind of you.
Yeah, I'm kind.

08:03.320 --> 08:05.880
I suppose that's why I'd make
a good head of form.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.840
SHE SNEEZES

08:05.880 --> 08:07.840
Ah...

08:07.840 --> 08:10.640
Well, save your efforts.
I've the hay fever.

08:10.640 --> 08:11.960
SHE SNIFFS LOUDLY

08:11.960 --> 08:13.880
You're shameless.

08:15.560 --> 08:20.160
Father says politics is a ruthless
game and every ballot counts.

08:20.160 --> 08:24.040
Well, butter me up all your like,
Gwendoline.

08:24.040 --> 08:26.520
I do not have a vote.

08:26.520 --> 08:29.600
Oh. And make your bed. Right.

08:44.200 --> 08:45.400
SEAGULLS CRY

08:46.520 --> 08:48.560
Come on in, Ellen. It's wonderful.

08:48.560 --> 08:50.840
It's not. It's ghastly.

08:50.840 --> 08:54.120
Freezing cold and seaweed.

08:54.120 --> 08:56.520
Ellen, stick with me on the side.

08:56.520 --> 08:59.320
Poor Ellen. Gwen's got her hooks
into her already.

08:59.320 --> 09:02.480
Whoever's head of form
needs to look out for that.

09:03.920 --> 09:06.840
Let go, Gwen. Ellen, come with me.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.680
Wait a sec. The thing is...

09:08.680 --> 09:11.400
Don't let Gwen talk you out of it.
You'll love it once you're in.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.040
But I can't...

09:13.040 --> 09:14.960
Yes, you can. Follow me.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.880
Wait! No...

09:20.160 --> 09:22.400
Help!

09:22.400 --> 09:24.120
Help!

09:24.120 --> 09:25.720
Argh! I can't swim!

09:25.720 --> 09:28.200
It's all right, we've got her.
We're fine.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.920
I've got you.

09:30.920 --> 09:32.680
ELLEN SPLUTTERS

09:32.680 --> 09:34.520
Are you all right?

09:37.240 --> 09:39.160
I-I'm so sorry!

09:39.160 --> 09:41.000
Why didn't you say?

09:41.000 --> 09:43.680
I did try!

09:43.680 --> 09:46.640
I'm desperate to learn,
but it's not my fault.

09:46.640 --> 09:48.480
I live nowhere near the sea.

09:48.480 --> 09:51.800
Not everyone does, you know!
Hot-headed, impetuous Darrell.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.960
Some head of form you'd make.
She pushed me in last year as well,

09:54.960 --> 09:59.000
you know. That was an accident
and this wasn't a push.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.200
She actually slapped me,
right here in this pool.

10:02.200 --> 10:05.080
What?! I have a hold
on my temper now.

10:05.080 --> 10:07.520
I don't lose it any more.

10:07.520 --> 10:11.320
Really?
You don't seem very calm right NOW.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.040
GIRLS LAUGH

10:21.320 --> 10:24.800
If you could all write your name
followed by my name and the form

10:24.800 --> 10:26.760
on the front cover, please.

10:28.400 --> 10:31.840
Gwendoline. Sorry. Nearly done.

10:35.400 --> 10:39.240
There. Don't they brighten
the classroom? Very nice.

10:39.240 --> 10:42.480
I'd make it a regular thing
if I were head of form.

10:44.120 --> 10:47.160
That's not how you spell my name.
Write it correctly on the board,

10:47.160 --> 10:50.120
please. "Park-er" - like a park.

11:03.800 --> 11:06.080
Darrell - no C.

11:07.880 --> 11:11.040
No. "Park-er". Again, correctly.

11:13.080 --> 11:16.520
I would expect better handwriting
from a possible head of form.

11:17.880 --> 11:19.560
Oh, I see.

11:19.560 --> 11:22.160
Class clown, are you? No...
Sorry, Mr Parker.

11:22.160 --> 11:24.560
It's just that I've got word
blindness. Word blindness?

11:24.560 --> 11:25.840
Is that so?

11:25.840 --> 11:28.680
ANGRILY: Write my name correctly,
young lady - now.

11:28.680 --> 11:31.120
Parker, like parking a car.

11:37.040 --> 11:41.000
Don't worry. Darrell's always
getting herself into trouble.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.640
Parked car... Darrell!

11:45.120 --> 11:48.520
How dare you? No... Sorry,
Mr Parker, it's just,

11:48.520 --> 11:50.600
my word blindness,
when I'm under pressure...

11:50.600 --> 11:53.000
Do you take me for a fool?
But it's true, Mr Parker.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.280
She has got something...
200 lines for interrupting.

11:55.280 --> 11:59.080
Education is a privilege.
I will not fool around in class.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.880
That's not fair! You can't punish
her for being honest, it's wrong!

12:01.880 --> 12:05.040
Get out. Stand outside for the rest
of the lesson and reflect

12:05.040 --> 12:08.600
on your behaviour.
You will write the lines too.

12:19.920 --> 12:23.320
Tut, tut. In trouble already?

12:23.320 --> 12:27.200
Are you sure you should be standing
for head of form, Darrell Rivers?

12:28.200 --> 12:29.640
MATRON CHUCKLES

12:38.400 --> 12:42.000
Mr Parker, I want to say I'm sorry,
truly, I am. Am I supposed

12:42.000 --> 12:45.640
to believe that after your behaviour
just now? I have a bad temper.

12:45.640 --> 12:48.200
It's a terrible fault of mine,
but I'm trying to conquer it.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.240
It's all well and good saying
you're sorry,

12:50.240 --> 12:51.640
but I need to see you mean it.

12:52.640 --> 12:55.080
Um... Very well, I'd...

12:55.080 --> 12:57.800
I'd like to withdraw my nomination
for head of form.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.320
Accepted.

13:01.320 --> 13:03.080
Um, the right response.

13:03.080 --> 13:05.560
But we do need three nominations.

13:05.560 --> 13:07.880
I have a suggestion for that.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.720
And he said yes, so, Sally,
you're in the running for

13:11.720 --> 13:13.520
head of form after all.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.560
Aren't you pleased?

13:16.560 --> 13:19.320
Yes, but sad for you, Darrell.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.400
Don't be. You'll be great.

13:24.040 --> 13:27.080
If you want to pull out, fine.
But putting Sally forwards -

13:27.080 --> 13:29.760
she could beat me.
The teachers love her. I'm sorry...

13:29.760 --> 13:32.880
At least say you'll vote for me.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.440
I put Sally forward, so...

13:35.440 --> 13:39.160
I miss Betty.
She was a proper, loyal friend.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.920
As your head of form...

13:57.920 --> 14:00.080
As the new head of form...

14:00.080 --> 14:01.360
Urgh.

14:04.280 --> 14:05.640
Sally!

14:07.680 --> 14:09.160
Sally?

14:11.400 --> 14:12.800
Sally?

14:17.080 --> 14:21.960
There you are. Poor Irene has piano,
so I said I'd write her lines.

14:23.800 --> 14:27.240
What's up?
My speech, I'm utterly stuck.

14:27.240 --> 14:29.880
But you've got great
leadership qualities.

14:29.880 --> 14:32.600
Even Alicia thinks so. Do I?

14:32.600 --> 14:34.160
I can't think of any.

14:34.160 --> 14:38.080
You're kind, generous,
thoughtful, considerate.

14:38.080 --> 14:41.760
Why not just say so? Because that
would be awfully conceited.

14:41.760 --> 14:45.000
Being head is about helping
others, not showing off.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.160
See, that's why you'd
be the best head.

14:47.160 --> 14:49.920
That's all you have to say.
Thanks, Darrell.

14:49.920 --> 14:53.080
Now, let's pick up these papers
and see what you've got so far.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.240
BELL RINGS

15:06.240 --> 15:08.480
Settle down, girls. Come along.

15:11.760 --> 15:14.000
Good afternoon, girls.
Now we're all assembled,

15:14.000 --> 15:16.240
let's hear from our nominees.

15:16.240 --> 15:18.160
Remember, keep it brief.

15:22.680 --> 15:27.360
Let's start with a question.
Why is a math book always unhappy?

15:27.360 --> 15:30.520
Because it has a lot of problems.
LAUGHTER

15:30.520 --> 15:33.680
I know that was a joke,
but I do think happiness

15:33.680 --> 15:35.360
is the key to success.

15:35.360 --> 15:38.720
So, problem solving and happiness
all around would be my aim

15:38.720 --> 15:43.760
as head of form. That would include
no detention, no order marks -

15:43.760 --> 15:46.080
and hot cocoa EVERY day.

15:50.720 --> 15:52.560
Good day, everyone.

15:52.560 --> 15:56.760
I know many of you may think
of me as just a pretty face,

15:56.760 --> 16:01.320
but Malory Towers and
our wonderful teachers

16:01.320 --> 16:04.160
have sharpened my
less visible qualities,

16:04.160 --> 16:06.760
and I now feel ready to lead.

16:06.760 --> 16:08.960
To borrow from Mr Churchill,

16:08.960 --> 16:14.480
all my previous life has been
but a preparation for this hour.

16:14.480 --> 16:18.720
Put your trust in me,
and I will not let you down.

16:20.040 --> 16:22.160
What was that? Thank you.

16:24.640 --> 16:26.280
Claptrap. Hot air.

16:34.520 --> 16:36.880
Hello, everyone.

16:36.880 --> 16:40.000
Being nominated is a huge privilege.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.520
Thank you.

16:45.760 --> 16:48.600
But I don't want to be head of form.

16:52.440 --> 16:56.440
If I were voted in, I'd change
the title to form representative.

16:56.440 --> 17:00.520
I'd see my job as representing each
girl's different needs

17:00.520 --> 17:03.440
and making things fair and
equal for us all.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.960
MISS GRAYLING: Thank you
very much, girls.

17:12.960 --> 17:16.280
Now, write one name on your paper

17:16.280 --> 17:20.160
and post it in the ballot box.
We'll announce results tomorrow.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.520
WATER DRIPS

17:49.960 --> 17:51.520
Urgh...

17:58.440 --> 18:01.040
Ellen. Hm?

18:01.040 --> 18:02.480
I've been thinking.

18:02.480 --> 18:05.280
As a new girl, you'd be much
better off in the middle bit,

18:05.280 --> 18:08.200
so you can get to know everyone.
I'll help you move.

18:08.200 --> 18:11.760
Er... That's very generous
of you, Gwen.

18:11.760 --> 18:12.920
Wait.

18:14.240 --> 18:15.720
Is that water?

18:15.720 --> 18:18.640
Are you swapping because
there's a drip? What drip?

18:18.640 --> 18:21.280
You can't palm that off on the new
girl, Gwen. You'll have to wait

18:21.280 --> 18:23.520
till Matron gets it fixed.
I don't mind.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.880
I'll switch if it means that much
to you. You are a sport.

18:25.880 --> 18:28.560
Stay where you are, Ellen.
What am I supposed to do?

18:28.560 --> 18:30.080
I can't please you all.

18:30.080 --> 18:33.480
Sally Hope, you're a bossy boots,
just like I said. But you're not

18:33.480 --> 18:36.200
head of form yet,
and you may never be.

18:36.200 --> 18:40.240
No, but it might be me,
and I agree with Sally.

18:40.240 --> 18:41.840
No switching.

18:41.840 --> 18:46.360
Don't worry. If I'm head, I'll make
sure to take all your minds off it.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.760
Tomorrow night -
celebratory midnight feast?

18:48.760 --> 18:50.560
Urgh.

18:50.560 --> 18:54.320
Where are you going, Gwen? To report
the leak, because I'm a natural

18:54.320 --> 18:57.520
leader, and it's the
responsible thing to do.

19:09.920 --> 19:11.440
VOICES INSIDE ROOM

19:12.560 --> 19:16.120
The moment of truth.
Who shall it be, I wonder?

19:16.120 --> 19:20.720
I have no doubt the girls will
choose their head of form wisely.

19:20.720 --> 19:23.360
And how many for Gwendoline?
Only two.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.520
And one will be her own.

19:25.520 --> 19:27.160
And Alicia?

19:27.160 --> 19:29.480
Um, she seems to be
the popular sort.

19:29.480 --> 19:31.880
She's done very well.
She certainly doesn't lack

19:31.880 --> 19:33.760
for charisma and enthusiasm.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.240
THEY LAUGH

19:35.240 --> 19:36.440
LOUD BANG

19:36.440 --> 19:37.920
What was that?

19:49.280 --> 19:51.240
Ah, yes. Darrell's lines.

19:51.240 --> 19:54.560
"Education is a privilege,
I will not fool around in class."

19:54.560 --> 19:57.800
And look at her spelling,
is she very lazy or very stupid?

19:57.800 --> 20:01.640
Darrell is neither of those things.
She has word blindness.

20:01.640 --> 20:04.960
I'm sorry?
Dyslexia is the newer term for it.

20:04.960 --> 20:06.800
Please, do read up.

20:08.960 --> 20:11.240
Now, shall we?

20:12.320 --> 20:13.760
BELL RINGS

20:15.120 --> 20:16.480
GIRLS LAUGH

20:22.320 --> 20:25.840
Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased
to announce we have now counted

20:25.840 --> 20:28.680
the votes for the new head of form.

20:28.680 --> 20:30.840
Mr Parker.

20:30.840 --> 20:35.040
Mr Parker, Alicia Johns is totally
unsuitable to be head of form.

20:35.040 --> 20:37.520
We should all vote again.
Wait until you hear

20:37.520 --> 20:40.160
what she's planning to do tonight.
Gwendoline, is telling tales

20:40.160 --> 20:42.600
a quality that's admired
at Malory Towers?

20:44.520 --> 20:45.880
Take a seat.

20:49.880 --> 20:54.120
I just want to say that you did
a wonderful, wonderful job.

20:55.360 --> 20:58.440
I'm SO proud of each
and every one of you.

21:00.040 --> 21:04.040
It was a close run race.
But in the end, by one vote,

21:04.040 --> 21:06.000
head of form went to...

21:08.080 --> 21:09.600
..Sally Hope.

21:20.160 --> 21:23.720
Whilst I applaud your desire
to change the role's name

21:23.720 --> 21:28.000
to form representative, I'm afraid
we can't have new badges made.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.800
Congratulations to Sally.

21:45.360 --> 21:46.600
Er, girls.

21:48.560 --> 21:51.800
I hadn't heard about this word
blindness business, Darrell.

21:52.960 --> 21:55.560
I will look into it.

21:55.560 --> 21:57.720
Oh, go on, then. Dismissed.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.920
It was a near thing.

22:24.640 --> 22:26.480
And only one vote in it.

22:27.400 --> 22:29.440
Who did you vote for?

22:29.440 --> 22:31.880
I stood by the person I nominated.

22:33.280 --> 22:35.760
Well, you got what you wanted,
didn't you?

22:35.760 --> 22:37.360
The head of form must be good,

22:37.360 --> 22:40.200
you're the most fun person in the
class, I don't want to lose that.

22:40.200 --> 22:41.960
No hard feelings?

22:43.320 --> 22:45.280
Actually, yeah.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.840
I'm devastated.

22:48.040 --> 22:49.960
Tonight's feast is cancelled.

22:51.920 --> 22:54.000
Gotcha!

22:54.000 --> 22:55.920
Not really.

22:55.920 --> 22:57.680
You're right, Darrell.

22:57.680 --> 23:01.040
To be head, you have to be
dull as ditch water.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.800
Sally's welcome to it.

23:02.800 --> 23:04.800
Come on, let's celebrate.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.920
Freedom and fun.

23:06.920 --> 23:08.240
SHE LAUGHS

23:11.120 --> 23:12.600
SLOW BIG BAND MUSIC

23:19.640 --> 23:22.280
SHE COUGHS AND SPLUTTERS
JEAN LAUGHS

23:22.280 --> 23:24.400
Don't laugh, Jean. It's not kind.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.560
Never had fizzy pop before.

23:26.560 --> 23:28.240
Top up?

23:28.240 --> 23:31.320
Thanks. She didn't want any more.

23:31.320 --> 23:35.240
I can speak for myself, Gwen.
I'd love another taste.

23:35.240 --> 23:37.800
It's like swimming. Just because
I've never tried it before

23:37.800 --> 23:39.320
doesn't mean I don't want to.

23:39.320 --> 23:42.400
I could help you learn
to swim, if you like.

23:42.400 --> 23:44.560
I'd like that very much.

23:42.400 --> 23:44.560
THEY LAUGH

23:44.560 --> 23:45.880
Cheers. Cheers.

23:45.880 --> 23:48.320
Darrell, I've asked my brothers to
send me a trick in the mail.

23:48.320 --> 23:50.960
You'll help, won't you? Of course.
So, what do you think it is?

23:50.960 --> 23:53.640
I've no idea... You two look like
you're plotting something.

23:53.640 --> 23:56.360
Alicia's going to...
Darrell, let's set a record on.

23:58.400 --> 24:01.400
You can't tell Sally. She's head of
form now, she'll spoil the fun.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.600
But I... Promise you won't say?

24:03.600 --> 24:05.720
Promise? I'll never trust you again.

24:05.720 --> 24:07.840
Um, what are you two
whispering about?

24:07.840 --> 24:10.920
Sally, let's dance. Darrell?
Nothing important at all.

24:10.920 --> 24:13.000
JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS

24:17.360 --> 24:20.400
Come on, Darrell. Cheer up.
Let's have some fun.

24:20.400 --> 24:21.440
THEY LAUGH

24:29.960 --> 24:31.560
ALL: Wooooo!

24:31.560 --> 24:33.320
Again, again! Woo!
