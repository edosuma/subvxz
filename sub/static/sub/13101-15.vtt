00:02.583 --> 00:07.625
(John)
Captain's personal log,
September 2, 2261.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.167
Enough is enough.

00:13.417 --> 00:15.292
[dramatic music]

00:34.500 --> 00:36.833
Londo, what do they want?

00:36.917 --> 00:39.000
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

00:44.875 --> 00:47.625
[indistinct chatter]

01:00.208 --> 01:01.958
They're waiting.

01:08.708 --> 01:10.958
I'm sorry to call you
together at this early hour

01:11.042 --> 01:12.625
but we don't
have a lot of time.

01:13.958 --> 01:16.208
[sighs]
Commander.

01:16.292 --> 01:18.500
For the last month or so,
ships from Babylon 5

01:18.583 --> 01:20.792
have been patrolling the borders
of your governments.

01:20.875 --> 01:22.000
Since we've been
protecting you

01:22.083 --> 01:23.625
from raiders
and border skirmishes

01:23.708 --> 01:27.167
the number of incidents
has decreased 70 percent.

01:27.250 --> 01:30.000
May we assume that you are
all happy with this arrangement?

01:31.250 --> 01:34.292
Good. Because now
there is a price tag.

01:35.583 --> 01:37.417
By now, most of you have heard
of the attacks

01:37.500 --> 01:39.542
against civilian targets
by ships from Earth.

01:39.625 --> 01:42.583
In the latest attack
authorized by President Clark

01:42.667 --> 01:46.500
ten thousand civilians were
killed as an example to others.

01:46.583 --> 01:49.500
We can no longer
tolerate this behavior.

01:49.583 --> 01:52.333
Alpha squadron,
status report.

01:52.417 --> 01:55.042
(male #1 on radio)
'Alpha squadron
ready for launch.'

01:55.125 --> 01:56.417
Launch!

02:01.208 --> 02:02.292
(John)
'Most of your governments have'

02:02.375 --> 02:04.250
'mutual defense treaties
with Earth.'

02:04.333 --> 02:06.792
As of right now in exchange

02:06.875 --> 02:09.542
for our continued patrol
along your borders

02:09.625 --> 02:12.250
I'm declaring those treaties
null and void.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.125
[indistinct chattering]

02:15.792 --> 02:18.583
I have no problem with this.

02:18.667 --> 02:21.292
You have been here for us
from the beginning.

02:22.583 --> 02:24.167
During their war
with the Minbari

02:24.250 --> 02:26.542
'I supervised
arms sales to Earth.'

02:26.625 --> 02:30.125
'They promised...to help us
when we needed them.'

02:30.208 --> 02:32.833
But where was Earth when our
borders were being attacked?

02:32.917 --> 02:34.542
Where was Earth
when the Shadows

02:34.625 --> 02:37.417
were rampaging
across our territories?

02:37.500 --> 02:39.125
They did nothing!

02:40.250 --> 02:42.458
We owe them
nothing in return.

02:43.167 --> 02:45.542
Thank you, G'Kar.

02:45.625 --> 02:48.917
It's not only our people
who are at risk here.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.583
Clark's propaganda machine

02:50.667 --> 02:54.917
is feeding the anti-alien
hysteria back home.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.083
In time all of you will be hurt
if they're not stopped.

02:58.167 --> 03:00.167
Well, we intend to stop them.

03:00.250 --> 03:02.750
Delta squadron, launch!

03:09.417 --> 03:10.917
We ask that each of you
contribute at least

03:11.000 --> 03:14.125
one destroyer-class ship
to the defense of Babylon 5.

03:14.208 --> 03:15.625
Your people here will
need to be protected

03:15.708 --> 03:17.792
in case Clark
tries to retaliate.

03:17.875 --> 03:20.917
Beyond that,
don't get involved.

03:22.042 --> 03:23.958
Anyone gets in between
us and them

03:24.042 --> 03:26.750
won't live long enough
to regret it.

03:26.833 --> 03:29.542
'You will not respond to any
request for military assistance'

03:29.625 --> 03:32.458
from President Clark
or the Earth alliance

03:32.542 --> 03:34.875
except in the form
of humanitarian aid.

03:36.417 --> 03:39.583
From now on,
Earth stands alone.

03:41.208 --> 03:42.625
'We're taking back Proxima 3'

03:42.708 --> 03:44.875
'we're taking back Mars.'

03:44.958 --> 03:46.875
Then..

03:46.958 --> 03:48.958
...we're gonna
take back our home..

03:51.042 --> 03:52.500
...or die trying.

03:58.958 --> 04:00.958
(Lennier)
It was the year of fire.

04:01.042 --> 04:02.917
(Zack)
The year of destruction.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.958
(G'Kar)
The year we took back
what was ours.

04:06.042 --> 04:07.625
(Lyta)
It was the year of rebirth.

04:07.708 --> 04:09.958
(Vir)
The year of great sadness.

04:10.042 --> 04:11.833
(Marcus)
The year of pain.

04:11.917 --> 04:13.333
(Delenn)
And the year of joy.

04:13.417 --> 04:15.042
(Londo)
It was a new age.

04:15.125 --> 04:16.875
(Franklin)
It was the end of history.

04:16.958 --> 04:19.958
(Susan)
It was the year
everything changed.

04:22.500 --> 04:25.042
(Michael)
The year is 2261.

04:25.125 --> 04:28.375
(Sheridan)
The place, "Babylon 5."

04:28.458 --> 04:30.292
[theme music]

05:00.875 --> 05:02.750
[music continues]

05:25.042 --> 05:30.042
[dramatic music]

05:30.125 --> 05:31.542
- Out of the way! Move!
- Excuse me.

05:31.625 --> 05:32.875
- Get back. Hey!
- Everyone, step back!

05:32.958 --> 05:34.542
- What's your hurry?
- Step back. Step back.

05:35.667 --> 05:36.750
Watch it!

05:38.792 --> 05:40.125
- Whoa.
- Hey.

05:45.167 --> 05:46.125
Where the hell is he?

05:46.208 --> 05:48.333
He said he's on his way.

05:50.333 --> 05:53.250
- I've got it!
- 'Let's see.'

05:53.333 --> 05:54.417
It would have got here faster

05:54.500 --> 05:55.917
if I could have just
sent it out.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.208
We couldn't risk
anyone intercepting it.

05:58.292 --> 06:01.625
- Is it current?
- As current as we can make it.

06:01.708 --> 06:03.458
Here.

06:03.542 --> 06:06.500
Clark's stationed half a dozen
omega-class destroyers

06:06.583 --> 06:09.583
between Proxima 3
and the local jump gate.

06:09.667 --> 06:11.667
'There is also a series
of planetary scanners'

06:11.750 --> 06:13.833
that can detect any ship
trying to leave.

06:13.917 --> 06:15.125
It's good positioning.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.750
Anybody trying to take off
gets shot down

06:16.833 --> 06:18.500
before escaping the blockade

06:18.583 --> 06:20.792
and no one comes through
the gate without being seen.

06:20.875 --> 06:22.833
The colony is very
close to surrendering.

06:22.917 --> 06:25.375
They're running out
of food, water, supplies.

06:25.458 --> 06:26.792
'They're down
to almost nothing.'

06:26.875 --> 06:28.958
That's why they
keep trying to escape.

06:29.042 --> 06:32.792
Better to be shot down
than to starve to death.

06:32.875 --> 06:34.292
Do you have an I.D.
on those ships?

06:34.375 --> 06:35.750
Yes.

06:38.708 --> 06:40.583
The Heracles under
captain Trevor Hall

06:40.667 --> 06:42.625
the Juno under
captain James Mandala

06:42.708 --> 06:45.042
the Pollux, Captain
Elizabeth Morgenstern

06:45.125 --> 06:47.667
'the Nemesis,
Captain Yoshi Kawagawa'

06:47.750 --> 06:49.667
'the Vesta, Captain
Edward MacDougan'

06:49.750 --> 06:53.292
and the Furies,
Captain Stephanie Eckland.

06:53.375 --> 06:55.750
Which one of them destroyed
the civilian transports?

06:55.833 --> 06:57.333
The Heracles and the Pollux.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.417
Do you know either
of the captains involved?

06:59.500 --> 07:01.125
No. So they're new.

07:01.208 --> 07:03.667
Which probably means
they're loyal to Clark.

07:03.750 --> 07:05.500
Have any of them
deliberately avoided

07:05.583 --> 07:07.625
shooting at civilian targets?

07:07.708 --> 07:10.125
(Marcus)
I don't know. It'll take
a little while to find out.

07:10.208 --> 07:11.417
Well, get moving.

07:11.500 --> 07:12.917
We need to know how many
destroyers are committed

07:13.000 --> 07:15.708
to the blockade
and how many are holding back.

07:17.667 --> 07:19.417
(John)
Stephen, how are you
doing with the telepaths

07:19.500 --> 07:21.958
we rescued
from the Shadows?

07:22.042 --> 07:24.167
Well, we wake them
for brief periods

07:24.250 --> 07:25.333
but they're still
under the influence

07:25.417 --> 07:27.000
of the mind control devices.

07:27.083 --> 07:29.625
Haven't found a way to remove
them without causing damage.

07:29.708 --> 07:32.917
I need them mobile, as many as
you can and as fast as you can.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.167
Not for this operation,
but soon.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.750
I'll do my best.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.042
They've got the place
buttoned up tight.

07:47.125 --> 07:48.125
We're gonna have
a hell of a time

07:48.208 --> 07:49.167
fighting our way in there.

07:49.250 --> 07:51.417
Mm-hmm. We'll hit them in waves.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.875
'Try to isolate the ships
we need to destroy'

07:53.958 --> 07:56.458
'from the ones who won't fight
unless they have to.'

07:56.542 --> 07:59.167
Then we'll give them a chance
to surrender or join up.

07:59.250 --> 08:01.167
And if they don't?

08:01.250 --> 08:03.375
We take them out.

08:03.458 --> 08:05.958
Hey, I don't like the idea
any more than you do.

08:06.042 --> 08:08.042
But either we commit ourselves
to this completely

08:08.125 --> 08:09.500
or we don't do it.

08:09.583 --> 08:11.458
Once we pull the first trigger,
we can't hesitate

08:11.542 --> 08:14.708
to pull the next one,
because they sure won't.

08:14.792 --> 08:16.875
Now, once we're in,
we're in.

08:16.958 --> 08:19.167
No surrender..

08:19.250 --> 08:20.917
...and no retreat.

08:23.125 --> 08:24.708
[dramatic music]

08:31.875 --> 08:33.667
[doorbell beeps]

08:36.500 --> 08:39.542
Oh. Oh!
I didn't do it!

08:39.625 --> 08:40.583
I didn't do it!

08:40.667 --> 08:41.958
[doorbell beeps]

08:42.042 --> 08:46.083
Oh! Thank the great maker.
It was just a dream.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.333
Oh!

08:51.417 --> 08:53.208
[instrumental music]

08:55.083 --> 08:56.833
Open.

08:59.083 --> 09:00.083
Hello, Vir.

09:00.167 --> 09:01.500
Mr. Garibaldi.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.083
Is, uh, Londo around?

09:03.167 --> 09:04.750
I've got some business
in Centauri space

09:04.833 --> 09:07.125
so I figured he could help me
cut through the red tape.

09:07.208 --> 09:08.333
He's not here.

09:08.417 --> 09:11.250
He had to go set up
a meeting with G'K..

09:11.333 --> 09:13.000
He, uh, had a meeting.

09:13.083 --> 09:15.417
Oh, I see.

09:15.500 --> 09:18.458
Well, it looks, uh, like
you had a late night.

09:18.542 --> 09:21.625
No, not actually, they just,
um, got us up very early

09:21.708 --> 09:23.667
to brief us
on their new campaign.

09:23.750 --> 09:24.917
What new campaign?

09:25.000 --> 09:27.667
To take back Earth
and your outer colonies.

09:28.458 --> 09:29.583
I-I'm sorry.

09:29.667 --> 09:31.500
I-I thought you knew.

09:31.583 --> 09:34.000
No. No.

09:34.083 --> 09:35.625
Well, now that you do

09:35.708 --> 09:38.917
I-I imagine you'll
wanna sign on again.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.250
Not with Sheridan.

09:40.333 --> 09:42.000
Doesn't your homeworld
matter to you?

09:42.083 --> 09:43.625
Of course, it matters.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.458
But I don't like
the way he's doing this.

09:45.542 --> 09:47.000
Well, that's the way it is.

09:47.083 --> 09:49.000
I don't always like
the way Londo does things

09:49.083 --> 09:51.542
and, well, me and
most civilized worlds

09:51.625 --> 09:54.792
but, you know,
sometimes he's right.

09:54.875 --> 09:57.750
So I force myself to give him
the benefit of the doubt.

09:58.750 --> 10:00.208
I can't do that anymore.

10:00.292 --> 10:02.625
So you're not gonna
fight for your world?

10:02.708 --> 10:05.333
Of course, I'm gonna fight.
I'm gonna fight in my own way.

10:05.417 --> 10:06.583
Just tell Londo I came by

10:06.667 --> 10:08.667
and I'll check in
with him later.

10:10.708 --> 10:12.708
[music continues]

10:15.125 --> 10:17.250
[whooshing]

10:24.542 --> 10:25.792
How much longer
do you want them to continue

10:25.875 --> 10:27.292
running the drills, commander?

10:27.375 --> 10:30.042
Another hour, then bring
half of them in for refueling.

10:30.125 --> 10:31.625
After that, we'll
alternate squadrons.

10:31.708 --> 10:34.417
I don't want anyone outside with
less than half a tank of fuel.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.167
We'll rotate pilots
in for rest periods

10:36.250 --> 10:38.542
but other than that, I want
every ship we have out there.

10:38.625 --> 10:39.958
Will they be going
on the missions?

10:40.042 --> 10:42.667
Some, yes.
The rest we'll keep for fly-by.

10:42.750 --> 10:44.208
I don't intend
to get caught flat-footed

10:44.292 --> 10:46.458
in case Clark comes after us.

10:46.542 --> 10:48.083
Ivanova to all
fighter squadrons.

10:48.167 --> 10:49.542
'Adjust friend-or-foe systems'

10:49.625 --> 10:51.083
'to new frequencies
every 24 hours.'

10:51.167 --> 10:53.208
'You'll check in with
Lieutenant Corwin or myself'

10:53.292 --> 10:54.708
'for the code of the day.'

10:54.792 --> 10:56.792
'Once we are in combat
situations, you will not accept'

10:56.875 --> 10:59.375
'any order that does not use
the proper codes'

10:59.458 --> 11:02.208
'even if it seems to come from
Captain Sheridan or myself.'

11:02.292 --> 11:04.042
Earthforce has our
voice records on file

11:04.125 --> 11:06.583
and could simulate false
or misleading orders.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.083
C and C out.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.250
So from now on I guess
the operational phrase

11:10.333 --> 11:11.500
is "Trust no one?"

11:11.583 --> 11:13.958
No. Trust Ivanova,
trust yourself.

11:14.042 --> 11:16.042
Anybody else, shoot 'em.

11:24.833 --> 11:26.167
[dramatic music]

11:34.458 --> 11:36.583
White Star squadrons
are standing by, ready to go.

11:36.667 --> 11:39.167
As per your request,
White Stars 7, 12 and 18

11:39.250 --> 11:40.583
are in hyperspace
en route to Earth space.

11:40.667 --> 11:43.750
They should be arriving
in about 10 to 12 hours.

11:43.833 --> 11:47.250
Have them jump into normal space
as soon as they arrive.

11:47.333 --> 11:50.042
Two by Mars, another as
close to Earth as possible

11:50.125 --> 11:51.583
without being shot down.

11:51.667 --> 11:53.208
But they'll set off
the early warning systems

11:53.292 --> 11:54.958
and Clark will scramble
everything he's got.

11:55.042 --> 11:57.458
I want them to think we're
flying reconnaissance flights

11:57.542 --> 12:00.250
preparing for a strike
to liberate Mars or Earth.

12:01.708 --> 12:04.125
That should be enough
to make them panic.

12:04.208 --> 12:05.917
Call in all the ships
that he can--

12:06.000 --> 12:08.667
- While we hit Proxima 3?
- 'Exactly.'

12:08.750 --> 12:09.958
By the time they
get turned around

12:10.042 --> 12:11.458
we'll have secured Proxima.

12:11.542 --> 12:12.833
Then all we have to do
is hold on to it

12:12.917 --> 12:15.458
while we move on
to the next target.

12:15.542 --> 12:17.208
Have you heard
from Marcus yet?

12:17.292 --> 12:19.125
He should be almost
to Proxima by now.

12:19.208 --> 12:20.417
He's standing by in hyperspace

12:20.500 --> 12:21.875
with the first
White Star squadron.

12:21.958 --> 12:23.333
The rest of them will be
arriving in groups

12:23.417 --> 12:25.125
of twos and threes,
staying just far enough

12:25.208 --> 12:26.708
off the beacon
to avoid detection.

12:26.792 --> 12:30.292
Good. Good. That should give us
a jump on those destroyers.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.167
'I just hope
some of them join us.'

12:32.250 --> 12:34.458
Otherwise, this is gonna get
really ugly.

12:43.750 --> 12:47.333
(female #1 on radio)
Scout 17 to Heracles,
beginning patrol.

12:47.417 --> 12:51.250
(male #1)
'Roger that. Take your time.
We're not going anywhere.'

12:51.333 --> 12:52.625
(female #1)
'Affirmative.'

13:03.792 --> 13:07.042
(male #1)
White Star 14 to White Star
Prime, we're in position.

13:07.125 --> 13:10.000
Good. Maintain radio silence
until notified.

13:10.083 --> 13:11.500
I'm on with the resistance.

13:11.583 --> 13:14.083
We don't want too many signals
attracting attention.

13:14.167 --> 13:15.500
(male #1)
'Confirmed.'

13:16.833 --> 13:18.625
- You still there?
- 'Still here.'

13:18.708 --> 13:20.750
'Don't know how much
longer we can hold out.'

13:20.833 --> 13:23.250
We're moving
as fast as we can.

13:23.333 --> 13:26.583
Do you have any information
about which destroyers

13:26.667 --> 13:29.458
have avoided firing
at civilian targets?

13:29.542 --> 13:31.667
(male #2)
'Yeah. Uploading now.'

13:31.750 --> 13:33.458
Good.

13:33.542 --> 13:35.042
We'll contact you again
in five hours

13:35.125 --> 13:37.167
on the alternate frequency.
Stand by to--

13:37.250 --> 13:39.625

13:39.708 --> 13:41.375

13:41.458 --> 13:43.000
Are you alright?

13:43.083 --> 13:44.333
(male #2)
'Laser cannons.'

13:44.417 --> 13:47.042
'They sent in more ground forces
a few days ago.'

13:47.125 --> 13:49.250
'We're gonna have to tear down
the transmitter'

13:49.333 --> 13:51.250
'fall back to our
secondary base.'

13:51.333 --> 13:54.042
'Whatever you people are gonna
do, you'd better do it soon.'

[doorbell beeps]

14:11.708 --> 14:13.417
[beeping continues]

14:13.500 --> 14:14.542
Enter.

14:20.875 --> 14:22.375
Hello, G'Kar.

14:25.708 --> 14:30.000
I don't believe I have ever been
in your quarters before.

14:30.083 --> 14:33.208
Unless you count a cell
on Centauri Prime.

14:33.292 --> 14:35.875
I apologize
for the lack of chains.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.792
The cleaning service
must have removed them.

14:38.875 --> 14:42.750
It has much the same
feeling as your world..

14:42.833 --> 14:44.500
...dry

14:44.583 --> 14:46.167
red..

14:46.250 --> 14:47.750
...and depressing.

14:49.792 --> 14:50.917
I..

14:53.625 --> 14:58.625
Isn't it amazing how quickly
we fall into familiar patterns

14:58.708 --> 15:03.083
as soon as we come
into one another's orbit?

15:03.167 --> 15:06.000
'Like comets that flare
when they get too near the sun.'

15:07.292 --> 15:10.333
I did not come here
to spar with you, G'Kar.

15:11.917 --> 15:13.500
I came..

15:19.042 --> 15:20.750
...to talk to you.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.625
How is the eye?

15:27.500 --> 15:29.333
It sees.

15:29.417 --> 15:30.625
Good.

15:31.958 --> 15:33.292
Good.

15:35.208 --> 15:38.583
[sighs]
These last few years

15:38.667 --> 15:41.500
have been very difficult
for both of us, G'Kar.

15:41.583 --> 15:43.417
[scoffs]

15:43.500 --> 15:45.625
Harder on you, perhaps.

15:46.667 --> 15:48.458
But as the humans say

15:48.542 --> 15:52.000
it has not exactly been
a picnic for me either.

15:54.208 --> 15:57.125
I have no illusions
that you did what you did..

15:57.208 --> 16:00.667
...endured what you endured

16:00.750 --> 16:03.167
for the good of my people.

16:03.250 --> 16:05.458
You sacrificed your dignity

16:05.542 --> 16:07.750
your pride..

16:07.833 --> 16:10.708
...your eye to help free Narn.

16:12.125 --> 16:14.042
But still, in the process

16:15.083 --> 16:17.542
'you did help my own world'

16:18.667 --> 16:21.958
and I never
thanked you for that.

16:22.042 --> 16:24.917
I have no interest
in your thanks.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
I did not think
that you would

16:28.125 --> 16:30.292
but it is there anyway.

16:33.375 --> 16:34.875
[sighs]

16:34.958 --> 16:37.125
As I said..

16:37.208 --> 16:38.625
...a hard year.

16:39.792 --> 16:41.917
Yes..

16:42.042 --> 16:43.542
...a hard year.

16:47.667 --> 16:49.375
What you said before

16:49.458 --> 16:51.667
about the chains..

16:51.750 --> 16:53.417
...that was unkind, G'Kar.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.083
'When I saw you
in that cell'

16:58.167 --> 17:00.667
'beaten, chained..'

17:01.875 --> 17:03.917
'As I said, we have
never been friends'

17:04.000 --> 17:05.542
'we will never be friends.'

17:05.625 --> 17:08.750
'There is too much blood
between us, too much history.'

17:09.667 --> 17:11.917
'But I did feel for you'

17:12.958 --> 17:14.583
'as much as I did not want to.'

17:16.125 --> 17:18.375
In the beginning, it was..

17:18.458 --> 17:20.542
...little more than the sympathy

17:21.667 --> 17:24.333
one might feel
for any trapped animal.

17:26.875 --> 17:28.542
But in time..

17:30.042 --> 17:32.625
...I came to respect you.

17:32.708 --> 17:35.083
Your respect matters to me

17:35.167 --> 17:37.042
even less than your thanks.

17:38.500 --> 17:42.708
You are not going to give me
even an inch, are you?

17:42.792 --> 17:45.250
I promised to free Narn
if you cooperated.

17:45.333 --> 17:47.125
I could have easily
changed my mind

17:47.208 --> 17:49.208
but I kept my promise.

17:49.292 --> 17:51.625
Surely that entitles me
to something.

17:51.708 --> 17:54.875
Was there something else
you wanted to say?

17:54.958 --> 17:56.917
You may not
believe this, G'Kar

17:58.125 --> 18:00.125
but all I ever wanted

18:00.208 --> 18:03.792
is what is right
for my world.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.542
I am a patriot!

18:06.792 --> 18:08.750
As you are.

18:11.083 --> 18:13.042
I have made some..

18:14.917 --> 18:17.333
...very poor choices

18:17.417 --> 18:19.500
'in the last two years.'

18:19.583 --> 18:21.000
'Because I did not think'

18:21.083 --> 18:24.250
those choices almost
destroyed my world

18:24.333 --> 18:26.000
and yours!

18:26.083 --> 18:28.667
That is a humbling
realization, G'Kar.

18:29.708 --> 18:32.833
If, with a single wrong word

18:32.917 --> 18:35.333
I can become the enemy

18:35.417 --> 18:39.833
do I any longer
really understand

18:39.917 --> 18:41.417
who the enemy is?

18:43.958 --> 18:45.917
'I have spoken
with my government.'

18:46.000 --> 18:48.625
We will not remain neutral

18:48.708 --> 18:51.375
in the matter of Sheridan's war
with Earth.

18:51.458 --> 18:52.708
I have convinced them to throw

18:52.792 --> 18:56.167
our official support
to Sheridan.

18:59.458 --> 19:00.833
If the Narn

19:02.458 --> 19:03.833
were to do the same

19:04.542 --> 19:06.250
in a joint statement

19:08.250 --> 19:09.917
it might help.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.042
If two forces recently
at war with one another

19:13.125 --> 19:15.375
can agree on this..

19:16.958 --> 19:19.292
...perhaps it might help
to convince the others.

19:20.917 --> 19:22.583
Why?

19:23.917 --> 19:26.958
Because, while I do not know

19:27.042 --> 19:30.042
who the enemy is any longer

19:30.125 --> 19:32.792
I do know
who my friends are.

19:34.833 --> 19:38.083
And that I have not done
as well by them as I should.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.875
I hope to change that.

19:44.292 --> 19:46.458
I hope to do better.

19:49.458 --> 19:52.333
Before war broke out
between our governments

19:52.417 --> 19:54.292
you bought me a drink.

19:55.667 --> 19:57.542
I wish to return the favor.

20:00.167 --> 20:02.792
For the first time
in a hundred years

20:04.042 --> 20:06.792
we have something
in common beyond hatred.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.000
I find that
most extraordinary.

20:12.583 --> 20:14.833
And so, a drink.

20:14.917 --> 20:16.417
To the humans..

20:18.417 --> 20:21.000
...and to the bridge
they created between us..

20:22.542 --> 20:24.500
...in the hope
for a better future

20:25.708 --> 20:27.583
for both our worlds.

21:06.583 --> 21:08.125
I see.

21:26.167 --> 21:28.083
Captain on deck!

21:31.375 --> 21:32.750
As you were.

21:34.792 --> 21:36.917
We've received the information
we've been waiting for

21:37.000 --> 21:38.208
and can proceed
with the attack

21:38.292 --> 21:41.458
against the forces
holding Proxima 3.

21:41.542 --> 21:43.708
We'll hit them in three waves

21:43.792 --> 21:45.833
pull their forces apart

21:45.917 --> 21:48.958
and surround them
with superior firepower.

21:49.042 --> 21:52.417
The details have been
linked to your ships.

21:52.500 --> 21:55.917
You will not discuss that
information amongst yourselves

21:56.000 --> 21:57.375
or with anyone else

21:57.458 --> 21:59.625
until the mission
is complete.

21:59.708 --> 22:01.167
We'll be fighting
in close quarters

22:01.250 --> 22:03.042
so keep an eye out
for each other.

22:03.125 --> 22:04.625
If the battle deteriorates
into a fur ball

22:04.708 --> 22:07.667
we could sustain losses
from friendly fire.

22:07.750 --> 22:09.208
The Heracles and the Pollux

22:09.292 --> 22:11.125
have fired on civilian targets.

22:12.292 --> 22:15.125
So we consider them
a hostile vessel.

22:15.208 --> 22:17.292
The Nemesis and the Vesta
have apparently gone

22:17.375 --> 22:20.042
to great lengths
to avoid firing on civilians.

22:21.083 --> 22:22.250
The others..

22:23.500 --> 22:25.417
...we don't know.

22:25.500 --> 22:28.917
We'll give them a chance
to surrender or stand down

22:29.000 --> 22:31.750
but we won't risk
our forces to do it.

22:31.833 --> 22:33.208
So if you're fired upon

22:33.292 --> 22:35.583
or target vessel
locks onto your ship

22:35.667 --> 22:38.583
you have full authority
to return fire and engage.

22:40.167 --> 22:41.917
Of all the missions
we've flown..

22:43.792 --> 22:46.250
...this will be
the most difficult.

22:46.333 --> 22:48.750
I mean, it's one thing
to defend ourselves

22:48.833 --> 22:50.917
as we did last year.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.708
But to initiate combat
against our own forces..

22:56.667 --> 22:59.292
...that's a hard one.

22:59.375 --> 23:01.625
I can only tell you
that we take this action

23:01.708 --> 23:03.792
with the utmost reluctance.

23:03.875 --> 23:06.875
'If there were any other way'

23:06.958 --> 23:08.583
we'd take it.

23:10.250 --> 23:12.792
There isn't one.

23:12.875 --> 23:14.917
Now, we'll do what we can
to minimize casualties

23:15.000 --> 23:17.917
on the other side

23:18.000 --> 23:19.208
but the job of a soldier

23:19.292 --> 23:23.875
is to destroy the enemy
and come home alive.

23:25.833 --> 23:27.667
'To that end..'

23:29.292 --> 23:31.458
...do what you have to do.

it's him?'

'I think that's the general
idea, lieutenant.'

24:23.625 --> 24:25.125
Oh, Marcus, good.

Probably hoping we haven't
noticed them yet.

25:18.625 --> 25:19.833
Good.

Send the Pollux and the Nemesis

No.
Curious that.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.417
You think they'd send
the ones we know

25:39.500 --> 25:41.167
are liable to shoot.

25:41.250 --> 25:42.417
The hostiles might
be splitting up

25:42.500 --> 25:43.750
so they can be
with both groups

25:43.833 --> 25:45.708
to keep them in line.

25:45.792 --> 25:47.042
Unless they're all hostile

25:47.125 --> 25:50.625

hostile than others.

25:50.708 --> 25:52.625
Well, thank you for that
ray of sunshine, Marcus.

25:52.708 --> 25:54.333
Next time I feel
the need to be depressed

25:54.417 --> 25:56.125
I'll remember
to give you a call.

25:56.208 --> 25:59.542
Second unit, take position.
Stand by to jump.

26:04.542 --> 26:06.167
[intense music]

26:08.708 --> 26:11.708
Nemesis and Pollux
on final approach to Proxima.

26:13.583 --> 26:15.083
Now it gets interesting.

26:16.500 --> 26:20.625
All units, remember, do not fire
unless fired upon first.

26:20.708 --> 26:23.667
They may not fight for Clark,
but they will defend themselves.

26:23.750 --> 26:26.708
So don't back them
into a corner.

26:26.792 --> 26:29.458
Second unit...launch.

26:34.458 --> 26:37.792
We've got multiple warships
on approach vector.

26:38.708 --> 26:40.000
Silhouette unknown.

26:42.375 --> 26:44.625
Those are Sheridan's forces.

26:46.042 --> 26:49.000
I've heard about them,
but never seen them before.

26:49.083 --> 26:52.333
Captain Sheridan?
What's he doing here?

26:52.417 --> 26:54.375
Making a terminal error.

26:56.208 --> 26:58.125
This is fleet command.

26:58.208 --> 27:00.625
We've got hostiles
on attack vector.

27:00.708 --> 27:04.292
Vesta and Juno, launch fighters
and assume point.

27:05.083 --> 27:07.500
[dramatic music]

27:10.792 --> 27:13.542
A second enemy wing
is advancing on our position.

27:13.625 --> 27:15.708
Nemesis and Pollux
are aware of our situation

27:15.792 --> 27:17.417
and asking for instructions.

27:17.500 --> 27:19.708
Do we issue the recall order?

27:19.792 --> 27:21.750
Negative.

27:21.833 --> 27:25.333
If they turn around, they'll
expose their flank to the enemy

27:25.417 --> 27:27.875
and we'll be caught
between two groups of hostiles.

27:27.958 --> 27:30.542
Ten thousand kilometers
to optimum firing range.

27:30.625 --> 27:32.958
Pulse cannons standing by,
ready to fire.

27:33.042 --> 27:35.000
Defense grid armed,
ready to fire.

27:35.083 --> 27:36.250
[signal beeps]

27:36.333 --> 27:38.375
- Signal coming in.
- Let me hear it.

27:38.458 --> 27:41.250
(John)
'Repeat.
This is Captain John Sheridan'

27:41.333 --> 27:42.833
'to Earth destroyer group.'

27:42.917 --> 27:45.208
Track the signal.
Find out which ship he's in.

27:45.292 --> 27:47.917
Getting signal lock,
sir, it's..

27:48.000 --> 27:49.917
Sir, it's coming
from behind us.

27:54.542 --> 27:55.917
(John)
'You are ordered to stand down'

27:56.000 --> 27:58.583
'or leave the Proxima
system at once.'

27:58.667 --> 28:01.792
'You're in violation
of the Proxima treaty'

28:01.875 --> 28:05.000
'and your attacks on civilian
transports are illegal'

28:05.083 --> 28:09.250
'under the rules of engagement
and the articles of war.'

28:09.333 --> 28:12.167
You can leave peacefully,
if that is your choice.

28:12.250 --> 28:15.417
But we are prepared to use
deadly force, if necessary.

28:15.500 --> 28:16.875
Son of a..

28:16.958 --> 28:19.042
Eight thousand kilometers
to optimum firing range.

28:19.125 --> 28:20.792
Enemy ships closing at the rear.

28:20.875 --> 28:22.792
'Do we turn and engage
or continue?'

28:22.875 --> 28:25.792
Continue toward primary target.

28:25.875 --> 28:27.875
Fleet command
to Vesta and Furies.

28:27.958 --> 28:30.250
Come about
and engage rear targets.

28:30.333 --> 28:31.792
(Edward)
'This is captain
Edward MacDougan'

28:31.875 --> 28:33.375
'of the Vesta
to hostile vessels.'

28:33.458 --> 28:35.458
Mac? What the hell
are you doing?

28:35.542 --> 28:37.417
Maintain radio silence.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.458
Mackie..

28:39.542 --> 28:41.083
Long time, no see.

28:41.167 --> 28:44.042
(Edward)
'John, get your tail out
of here. This isn't gonna work.'

28:45.667 --> 28:49.500
Like it or not, Proxima 3
is under Earth jurisdiction.

28:52.042 --> 28:54.333
We can't allow them to secede,
whoever's in office.

28:54.417 --> 28:56.333
They broke away
after Clark started bombing

28:56.417 --> 28:58.667
civilian targets.

28:58.750 --> 29:01.333
What's the rule about following
an illegal order?

29:01.417 --> 29:03.917
You don't.
We're not involved.

29:04.833 --> 29:06.333
We haven't attacked anyone.

29:06.417 --> 29:08.167
(John)
But you're about to.

29:08.250 --> 29:10.958
Any action you take
in support of an illegal order

29:11.042 --> 29:13.125
makes you an accomplice
of that order.

29:14.208 --> 29:16.167
Oh, come on, Mackie.

29:16.250 --> 29:18.625
President Clark
is-is out of control.

29:18.708 --> 29:21.667
He's got you out here
on an illegal mission.

29:21.750 --> 29:23.458
'Back at the academy'

29:23.542 --> 29:25.667
'you used to pose
moral conflicts for us'

29:25.750 --> 29:27.292
'as part of our training.'

29:27.375 --> 29:30.833
'You said that soldiers
aren't machines.'

29:30.917 --> 29:32.625
'They have to think,
they have to decide'

29:32.708 --> 29:35.375
'if-if an order
is moral or not.'

29:37.417 --> 29:39.583
Well, what does your
conscience tell you?

29:46.583 --> 29:48.500
We have reached
optimum firing range.

29:48.583 --> 29:49.958
That damned MacDougan!

29:50.042 --> 29:52.500
I told the others he didn't
have what it takes.

29:52.583 --> 29:54.875
Fine. We'll force the issue.

29:55.625 --> 29:56.583
Open fire.

29:56.667 --> 29:58.292
[pulse cannons firing]

30:05.083 --> 30:06.333
[explosion]

30:06.417 --> 30:08.250
[grunts]

30:10.958 --> 30:12.542
Heracles has opened fire.

30:12.625 --> 30:14.583
'Other ships moving to support.'

30:14.667 --> 30:16.458
'Fighters launching.'

30:16.542 --> 30:18.917
Damn.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.042
Alright.

30:23.250 --> 30:26.042
All forces,
engage any hostile target.

30:26.125 --> 30:29.375
Fire at will.
I repeat, fire at will.

30:29.458 --> 30:31.125
[ships firing]

30:31.208 --> 30:33.250
[explosions]

30:39.833 --> 30:42.875
- 'Move out, Alpha 7, move out!'
- 'Alpha 4, overdrive failed!'

30:47.333 --> 30:49.708
[rumbling]

30:51.708 --> 30:53.250
Where the hell
is our support?

30:53.333 --> 30:54.542
What's the position
of the Vesta?

30:54.625 --> 30:57.000
Hanging back,
not engaging enemy.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.625
MacDougan

31:00.708 --> 31:02.958
this is a direct order
from fleet command.

31:03.042 --> 31:06.417
You will engage enemy ships
at once. Do you copy?

31:06.500 --> 31:09.375
'Engage enemy forces
at once!'

31:12.167 --> 31:13.917
[beeping]

31:14.000 --> 31:15.042
Negative, fleet commander.

31:15.125 --> 31:16.167
Vesta will not engage in support

31:16.250 --> 31:18.000
of illegal orders.

31:18.083 --> 31:19.875
(Trevor)
'This is a court martial
offense, Mackie!'

31:19.958 --> 31:22.375
'Do you understand that?'

31:22.458 --> 31:24.583
'Commander Philby,
under the authority'

31:24.667 --> 31:26.750
'of Earthforce command,
I am hereby promoting you'

31:26.833 --> 31:29.667
'to captain and ordering you
to relieve Captain MacDougan.'

31:29.750 --> 31:31.792
'You will bring the Vesta
into the fight.'

31:31.875 --> 31:34.000
'Do you copy, commander?'

31:37.958 --> 31:40.625
I always knew you wanted
a promotion, Bob.

31:41.958 --> 31:44.375
'Never knew how badly
until now.'

31:51.333 --> 31:53.958
[intense music]

31:54.042 --> 31:56.000
Vesta is starting
to come about.

31:56.083 --> 31:59.083
Pollux and Heracles are hit,
but continuing to fight.

31:59.167 --> 32:01.458
Juno, Nemesis and the Furies
are advancing

32:01.542 --> 32:02.583
but have not yet engaged.

32:02.667 --> 32:03.958
We can't divide our forces.

32:04.042 --> 32:06.167
We need to know where to put
our fire power.

32:07.375 --> 32:08.667
Put us on a course
for the Furies.

32:08.750 --> 32:09.792
Tell the others to concentrate

32:09.875 --> 32:12.125
on the Pollux and Heracles.

32:12.208 --> 32:14.167
Let's find out
where she stands.

32:18.125 --> 32:20.458
(John)
'Sheridan to Captain Eckland.'

32:20.542 --> 32:22.333
We are advancing
on your position

32:22.417 --> 32:24.208
but we are not
preparing to fire.

32:24.292 --> 32:28.167
I say again, we are not
preparing to fire.

32:28.250 --> 32:29.500
If you and your fighters
do not lock

32:29.583 --> 32:31.917
your weapon systems
onto our ships

32:32.000 --> 32:33.667
we will assume
you are not hostile

32:33.750 --> 32:35.167
and will not engage.

32:42.125 --> 32:44.208
Are they locking?

32:44.292 --> 32:46.167
Negative.

32:46.250 --> 32:47.250
Might be waiting for us
to get close

32:47.333 --> 32:49.583
and get a clean shot that way.

32:49.667 --> 32:51.833
Well, we're about to find out.

32:58.542 --> 33:00.208
Sheridan to Attack Fleet.

33:00.292 --> 33:03.208
Do not target Furies.
She's non-combatant.

33:03.292 --> 33:05.792
Repeat,
Furies non-combatant.

33:05.875 --> 33:07.375
[rumbling]

33:07.458 --> 33:10.708
That was the Vesta.
Forward guns have us in range.

33:10.792 --> 33:12.250
We've got fighters coming in.

33:16.917 --> 33:19.375
No, I won't fire on her.
Mackie's on board.

33:19.458 --> 33:22.500
We have no choice. They've
locked on, ready to fire.

33:22.583 --> 33:24.375
Damn. Prepare to--

33:24.458 --> 33:26.125
(Edward)
'Vesta to Sheridan.'

33:26.208 --> 33:28.333
Stand by. Mackie, go.

33:28.417 --> 33:29.750
(Edward)
'Commander Philby's promotion'

33:29.833 --> 33:32.542
has just been postponed
by the crew.

33:32.625 --> 33:36.583
The Vesta is non-hostile.
We are standing down.

33:36.667 --> 33:38.083
(John)
Confirmed, Mackie.

33:38.167 --> 33:40.083
- Two down.
- Three.

33:40.167 --> 33:42.000
Juno is withdrawing
from battle.

33:42.083 --> 33:43.917
[instrumental music]

33:47.167 --> 33:49.542
[explosions]

34:07.833 --> 34:10.792
God, the crew.

34:10.875 --> 34:14.458
Get to the life pods.
Get to the life pods.

34:16.875 --> 34:18.167
[explosion]

34:20.125 --> 34:21.667
[rumbling]

34:21.750 --> 34:23.708
(Marcus)
Pollux is destroyed.

34:23.792 --> 34:27.708
Nemesis has taken severe damage
and is offering to surrender.

34:27.792 --> 34:30.167
Get me the Heracles.

34:32.792 --> 34:35.042
Attack Fleet to Heracles.

34:35.125 --> 34:38.292
'You are outnumbered
and outgunned.'

34:38.375 --> 34:42.208
'Your defenses are down
and your weapons disabled.'

34:43.417 --> 34:46.292
'You will return control
of Proxima 3'

34:46.375 --> 34:48.292
'to its lawful government'

34:48.375 --> 34:51.667
'issue the recall order
to all fighters'

34:51.750 --> 34:54.250
'and surrender your vessel.'

34:54.333 --> 34:56.833
'You will comply
with these orders..'

34:56.917 --> 34:59.083
'...or be destroyed.'

34:59.167 --> 35:00.625
- Captain?
- He won't do it.

35:00.708 --> 35:01.917
He knows we can't hurt him.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.083
- He won't fire on us.
- 'You don't know that.'

35:04.167 --> 35:06.333
I'm in charge
of this mission, commander.

35:06.417 --> 35:08.833
I will not surrender Proxima
or stand trial

35:08.917 --> 35:10.292
for following direct orders.

35:10.375 --> 35:12.875
I'm the one they'll hold
responsible, not you.

35:12.958 --> 35:14.625
I'm dead either way.

35:14.708 --> 35:15.875
(John)
'You have 30 seconds.'

35:15.958 --> 35:17.333
I won't let you endanger
this ship

35:17.417 --> 35:18.417
because you are afraid to face

35:18.500 --> 35:20.333
the consequences
of your actions.

35:20.417 --> 35:23.000
Are you questioning
my orders, commander?

35:23.083 --> 35:26.333
No, sir.
I am relieving you of command.

35:26.417 --> 35:28.875
Remove Captain Hall
from the bridge.

35:32.542 --> 35:33.583
Now.

35:38.792 --> 35:41.542
Heracles to Attack Fleet.
The Heracles surrenders.

35:41.625 --> 35:44.292
I say again,
the Heracles surrenders.

35:44.375 --> 35:45.917
We are returning control
of Proxima 3

35:46.000 --> 35:47.208
to its local government.

35:47.292 --> 35:49.208
All fighters, return to base.

35:51.250 --> 35:53.333
It looks as if we won.

35:53.417 --> 35:56.000
No, we've achieved
the mission objective.

35:56.083 --> 35:58.625
a victory.

35:58.708 --> 36:01.875
Too many on both sides
had to die for it.

36:01.958 --> 36:04.292
And this is just the start.

36:04.375 --> 36:06.375
We had surprise on our side
this time.

36:06.458 --> 36:08.208
From now on,
it gets a lot harder.

36:11.667 --> 36:13.000
Have the captains
of the remaining ships

36:13.083 --> 36:15.792
meet me here in one hour.

36:15.875 --> 36:19.333
Let's see if we have
survivors...or allies.

36:38.625 --> 36:39.917
Please be seated.

36:44.500 --> 36:47.875
What happened here today
was difficult for all of us.

36:47.958 --> 36:50.167
But it's over now.

36:50.250 --> 36:54.417
What we have to decide now
is what we do next.

36:54.500 --> 36:56.708
Option one..

36:56.792 --> 36:59.292
You and your crews
can return home.

36:59.375 --> 37:01.542
I won't stop you.

37:01.625 --> 37:03.583
Sooner or later,
the Heracles and her crew

37:03.667 --> 37:05.125
will have to answer
for their actions

37:05.208 --> 37:07.833
'before a military tribunal.'

37:07.917 --> 37:09.958
But that's not our problem
for now.

37:11.667 --> 37:14.000
Option two..

37:14.083 --> 37:16.250
...you can stay here
and help protect Proxima 3

37:16.333 --> 37:19.042
from further retaliation
by President Clark.

37:20.500 --> 37:21.750
And option three..

37:24.208 --> 37:26.292
...you can come with us..

37:26.375 --> 37:27.583
'...join the fight.'

37:27.667 --> 37:30.000
Captain, I wasn't about
to let Captain Hall

37:30.083 --> 37:33.958
get the rest of my crew killed
defending Clark's policies.

37:34.042 --> 37:36.750
I happen to disagree
with those policies.

37:36.833 --> 37:39.917
But that doesn't mean I agree
with your actions either.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.250
It's not the role of
the military to make policy.

37:43.333 --> 37:45.250
Our mandate

37:45.333 --> 37:48.208
is to defend Earth
against all enemies

37:48.292 --> 37:49.667
foreign and domestic.

37:50.833 --> 37:53.500
Now Clark has become
that enemy.

37:55.292 --> 37:58.042
Your oath is to the Alliance
and to the people back home

37:58.125 --> 37:59.917
not to any particular
government.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.625
You're splitting that hair
mighty thin, John.

38:02.708 --> 38:04.375
Am I?

38:04.458 --> 38:08.292
Night watch, Ministry of Peace,
Ministry of Truth?

38:08.375 --> 38:10.833
I mean, is this the same
Alliance you joined

38:10.917 --> 38:13.708
or-or has it become
something else?

38:13.792 --> 38:15.708
'The orders you've been getting
do they represent'

38:15.792 --> 38:18.833
the ideal of the Alliance?

38:18.917 --> 38:21.458
Or of a dictatorship?

38:21.542 --> 38:24.500
You've been ordered to open
fire on civilian targets.

38:24.583 --> 38:26.625
'Is this what you
signed on for?'

38:27.708 --> 38:29.542
Now, we've made contact
with other ships

38:29.625 --> 38:31.833
that have left Earthforce.

38:31.917 --> 38:34.583
They should be getting here
in the next few hours.

38:34.667 --> 38:37.125
Now, some will stay
and hold Proxima.

38:38.125 --> 38:39.292
The others will come with us.

38:39.375 --> 38:41.250
I thought you had all
League Worlds

38:41.333 --> 38:42.708
backing you up.

38:42.792 --> 38:44.750
Why do you need us?

38:44.833 --> 38:48.208
Because I want this
to be a clean fight.

38:48.292 --> 38:49.542
The other worlds
won't fight for us

38:49.625 --> 38:51.250
but they won't get
in our way either.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.917
Now, it's your call.

38:56.042 --> 38:57.542
I'd like you to join us.

38:59.042 --> 39:01.333
We'll kick out Clark
and the Nightwatch

39:01.417 --> 39:02.583
and the rest of that bunch

39:02.667 --> 39:04.125
and we'll turn it over
to the voters.

39:04.208 --> 39:08.083
Let them decide if what
we did was right or wrong.

39:08.167 --> 39:10.875
Because, in the final analysis..

39:11.542 --> 39:12.750
[sighs]

39:12.833 --> 39:15.292
...those are the people
we work for.

39:22.833 --> 39:24.125
We need to talk it over.

39:26.750 --> 39:28.792
Of course.

40:15.292 --> 40:17.917
Issue the joint statement.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.125
I will sign my name.

40:22.333 --> 40:24.708
But not on the same page.

40:25.917 --> 40:27.708
Do you understand that?

40:27.792 --> 40:31.042
Yes...yes, of course.

41:23.542 --> 41:26.125
The others have decided.

41:26.208 --> 41:28.958
Commander Levitt is gonna
retire from the field.

41:29.042 --> 41:32.542
She's gonna take the Heracles
to Beta 9 for repairs.

41:32.625 --> 41:34.208
She's gonna keep Captain Hall
under house arrest

41:34.292 --> 41:37.917
until this is over,
one way or the other.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.708
And the rest?

41:39.792 --> 41:41.000
Eckland is gonna stay behind

41:41.083 --> 41:43.917
and help with the defense
of Proxima.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.750
Kawagawa wants
to sign on with you.

41:48.667 --> 41:49.958
And so do I.

41:56.708 --> 41:58.125
This is Commander Susan Ivanova

41:58.208 --> 42:00.375
bringing you the voice
of the Resistance.

42:00.458 --> 42:03.083
Today, elite forces
dispatched from Babylon 5

42:03.167 --> 42:06.125
engaged a destroyer group
stationed at Proxima 3.

42:06.208 --> 42:08.292
Both sides endured heavy losses.

42:08.375 --> 42:10.417
But we can announce
that Proxima 3

42:10.500 --> 42:13.083
has been liberated from
the forces occupying it.

42:13.167 --> 42:16.417
I repeat, Proxima 3 is free.

42:16.500 --> 42:18.417
Many of the destroyers
enforcing the blockade

42:18.500 --> 42:20.708
have now joined forces
with our ships.

42:20.792 --> 42:23.625
The campaign
to retake Earth has begun.

42:23.708 --> 42:25.792
As a result, we send
this plea to all cruisers

42:25.875 --> 42:28.417
and carrier groups that
have chosen to stand down

42:28.500 --> 42:31.625
rather than execute the illegal
orders of President Clark.

42:31.708 --> 42:32.792
Join us.

42:32.875 --> 42:33.875
'We will keep this channel open'

42:33.958 --> 42:35.667
24 hours a day.

42:35.750 --> 42:39.708
'If you wanna make a stand
for Earth, now is the time.'

42:39.792 --> 42:41.750
[indistinct chatter]

42:42.708 --> 42:44.792
Destination?

42:44.875 --> 42:47.167
Mars.

42:47.250 --> 42:49.542
- It'll take a while.
- Nope.

42:49.625 --> 42:50.875
I've got some people
in high places

42:50.958 --> 42:52.958
taking care of things.

42:53.042 --> 42:56.000
If you say so.
When you coming back?

42:59.375 --> 43:00.875
I'm not.

43:06.750 --> 43:09.250
(Susan on TV)
'In a related move, the Centauri
and Narn governments'

43:09.333 --> 43:11.833
'issued a joint statement today
recognizing the legitimacy'

43:11.917 --> 43:13.375
'of the liberation of Proxima'

43:13.458 --> 43:16.375
'and throwing their support
behind the new campaign.'

43:16.458 --> 43:18.333
'It is our hope
that this unprecedented'

43:18.417 --> 43:21.833
act of cooperation between two
previously hostile governments

43:21.917 --> 43:23.833
will mark the beginning
of a new age

43:23.917 --> 43:26.458
of cooperation and trust.

43:33.417 --> 43:35.500
