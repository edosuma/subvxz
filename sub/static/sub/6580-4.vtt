16:10.613 --> 16:13.532
Yes, that's why I pulled my gun.

Oh.

18:20.994 --> 18:23.661
Really? Confucius?

18:23.686 --> 18:26.587
- You're Korean.
- All the same to her.

18:26.612 --> 18:28.506
Hey, call me after you do the biopsy

18:28.531 --> 18:31.081
and make a diagnosis, so
I can take the credit.

18:31.106 --> 18:32.760
Ha-ha.

18:32.823 --> 18:35.019
Hey. You hear?

18:35.044 --> 18:36.744
The kid at the theater,
the one who got shot,

18:36.769 --> 18:38.832
he didn't have a gun, he had a leaf blower.

18:38.857 --> 18:40.030
- What?
- Yeah.

18:40.055 --> 18:42.155
It was some kind of prank.

18:44.822 --> 18:47.857
[indistinct intercom voice]

18:49.804 --> 18:51.528
[heart monitor beeping steadily]

18:51.553 --> 18:56.244
We have clamped the entire
blood supply to his liver.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.855
It's keeping him alive for now,

18:57.880 --> 19:00.332
but it's a temporary solution.

19:00.357 --> 19:03.492
He needs a liver transplant to survive.

19:03.517 --> 19:05.532
Which he won't get.

19:05.557 --> 19:08.604
Peter'll stay at the bottom
of the list, won't he?

19:09.582 --> 19:12.453
How long does he have?

19:14.136 --> 19:17.439
A day, maybe two.

19:24.852 --> 19:27.653
He did a bad thing,

19:27.678 --> 19:30.598
but he's not a bad person.

19:31.441 --> 19:34.423
He's just a boy.

19:35.161 --> 19:37.661
Please...

19:37.687 --> 19:40.980

19:54.363 --> 19:57.398

19:58.201 --> 19:59.577
Rumor's floating around,

19:59.602 --> 20:01.656
you're gonna want to hear it.

20:01.874 --> 20:05.029
The kid, Peter Wallace, he
has a website for his pranks.

20:05.054 --> 20:06.362
Look. Look at this.

20:06.387 --> 20:07.235
Look.

20:07.260 --> 20:08.626

20:22.295 --> 20:23.995
Mr. Miller?

20:24.020 --> 20:25.843
Excuse me, can I help you?

20:25.868 --> 20:28.769
Um...  How's he doing?

20:28.794 --> 20:30.350
Peter, the kid.

20:30.581 --> 20:32.462
I'm sorry, Mr. Miller, we can't give out

20:32.487 --> 20:33.646
patient information.

20:33.671 --> 20:37.005
- Is he alive?
- Yes.

20:37.029 --> 20:38.762
[sighs]

20:39.003 --> 20:41.937
An hour ago, everybody was clapping for me,

20:41.962 --> 20:44.378
and now, um...  [laughs]

20:44.403 --> 20:45.986
It looked so real.

20:46.011 --> 20:48.002
There's one patient
ahead of you for the CT.

20:48.027 --> 20:49.170
It shouldn't be long.

20:49.195 --> 20:50.802
I'll come get you.

20:50.827 --> 20:52.560
Thanks.

20:54.550 --> 20:57.618
I could swear he had a gun.

21:10.580 --> 21:13.517
This is so good!

21:13.925 --> 21:16.091
Mmm.

21:16.783 --> 21:18.083
Honey, please.

21:18.108 --> 21:22.043
- Don't eat so fast.
- Mom, I'm fine, really.

21:27.715 --> 21:29.500
- [retches]
- She's gonna be sick.

21:29.525 --> 21:30.665
Here.

21:30.690 --> 21:33.433
[vomiting]

21:33.458 --> 21:35.825
I knew all that grease would make her sick.

21:35.850 --> 21:37.913
So much for your magic pill.

21:38.182 --> 21:40.896
You okay? Has it passed?

21:42.880 --> 21:45.948
I'm sorry Ashley's having
such a tough time, but uh...

21:45.973 --> 21:48.465
her response has actually
tell us a great deal.

21:48.490 --> 21:50.377
I should hope so.

21:50.402 --> 21:52.105
Dr. Charles.

21:52.130 --> 21:54.136
Dr. Manning will be right back.

21:55.802 --> 21:57.135
Okay, honey.

21:57.160 --> 21:58.226
You're gonna be okay.

21:58.251 --> 21:59.330
What did you give her?

21:59.355 --> 22:00.754
- A Tic Tac.
- A Tic Tac?

22:00.779 --> 22:03.613
- Yes.
- You gave my patient a placebo?

22:03.638 --> 22:04.733
Yup.

22:04.758 --> 22:06.643
That's not ethical.

22:06.668 --> 22:07.867
Oh, balls.

22:07.892 --> 22:10.476
Look...  Nausea, no nausea.

22:10.501 --> 22:12.315
I now have a much clearer
picture of what's going on.

22:12.340 --> 22:14.871
I needed to get around
mother and see that girl eat.

22:14.896 --> 22:17.655
I could report you. I should report you.

22:17.680 --> 22:20.253
Dr. Manning, have you ever
heard of "bias confirmation"?

22:20.278 --> 22:22.447
- What?
- Bias confirmation.

22:22.472 --> 22:24.272
Interpreting information so that it

22:24.297 --> 22:26.740
conforms to one's preconceptions.

22:26.765 --> 22:31.068
Look, you walked in and
saw a thin 16-year-old girl

22:31.093 --> 22:32.620
with an overbearing mother,

22:32.645 --> 22:34.395
who reminded you of your college roommate.

22:34.420 --> 22:37.348
Who, very tragically, died of anorexia,

22:37.374 --> 22:39.475
so voila, the patient has anorexia.

22:39.500 --> 22:41.348
She has the indicators.

22:41.373 --> 22:43.373
She also has the contra-indicators.

22:43.398 --> 22:45.345
If the mother were that overbearing,

22:45.370 --> 22:46.600
she never would have allowed Ashley

22:46.625 --> 22:47.971
to choose that particular meal,

22:47.996 --> 22:50.569
and if Ashley were anorexic,
she never would have eaten it,

22:50.595 --> 22:52.529
let alone with such gusto.

22:52.610 --> 22:53.942
The mother is right.

22:53.967 --> 22:55.573
It's Ashley's body that's in trouble,

22:55.598 --> 22:57.441
and that is your department.

22:57.466 --> 23:00.042
Thank you.

23:01.164 --> 23:02.818
Is it true?

23:02.843 --> 23:05.042
Lucy Simm's liver is on its
way back to the hospital?

23:05.067 --> 23:07.659
The intended recipient died in pre-op.

23:07.684 --> 23:09.520
Peter is an HLA match, it can go to him.

23:09.545 --> 23:12.179
Yeah, there are names
ahead of him on the list.

23:12.204 --> 23:15.005
None of them are in this hospital.

23:15.030 --> 23:16.789
It has already been three hours,

23:16.814 --> 23:18.898
livers are viable for less than 12.

23:18.923 --> 23:21.090
By the time the list gets sorted out,

23:21.115 --> 23:25.337
the patient prepped, organ
shipped, it may be too late.

23:25.362 --> 23:28.808
Lucy's husband can direct
donate to whomever he chooses.

23:28.833 --> 23:31.511
Ask him to give it to Peter.

23:31.536 --> 23:33.207
You're talking about the man

23:33.232 --> 23:35.679
responsible for his wife's death.

23:35.704 --> 23:38.104
And he has done a horribly
stupid thing, I know,

23:38.129 --> 23:39.103
but he's a kid.

23:39.129 --> 23:42.680
Peter deserves a chance
to turn his life around.

23:45.935 --> 23:47.335
Dr. Charles.

23:47.360 --> 23:48.726
We have a patient that I think you might

23:48.728 --> 23:50.128
want to have a chat with.

23:50.130 --> 23:53.304
Oh. Thank you.

23:54.067 --> 23:56.253
I got...  I got mugged a few years ago,

23:56.278 --> 23:58.780
so I started carrying a gun for protection,

23:59.012 --> 24:00.712
and I took the classes.

24:00.737 --> 24:02.603
I passed the background checks.

24:02.628 --> 24:04.338
I'm not a vigilante.

24:04.363 --> 24:06.130
I don't go out looking for trouble.

24:06.132 --> 24:07.998
It was dark in that theater, you know.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.834
People were running around yelling, "Gun."

24:10.859 --> 24:13.904
I completely understand why you
thought he would have had one.

24:13.929 --> 24:15.317
That's right.

24:15.566 --> 24:18.701
I did what anyone would have done.

24:18.726 --> 24:20.910
But tell them.

24:21.624 --> 24:24.725
"My buddy pranked me with a
whoopee cushion, so I shot him."

24:24.750 --> 24:26.259
"Another genius gun nut,

24:26.284 --> 24:28.452
shoots first, and asks questions later."

24:28.477 --> 24:31.990
"Save the rest of us,
shoot yourself, hero."

24:31.991 --> 24:33.457
Those are the nice ones.

24:33.459 --> 24:35.901
Oh, the Internet, right?

24:35.926 --> 24:39.124
I mean, people use it to vent anonymously.

24:39.149 --> 24:40.450
None of them were in that theater.

24:40.475 --> 24:41.404
Yeah, well, uh...

24:41.429 --> 24:42.842
People believe what they want to,

24:42.844 --> 24:45.820
and because I'm the only
one that had a real gun,

24:45.845 --> 24:48.626
I'm the bad guy? That...

24:48.651 --> 24:50.217

to stay in for a week,

25:03.360 --> 25:04.238

25:13.131 --> 25:14.452
You sure?

25:14.477 --> 25:16.929
Um, why don't you let me

25:16.954 --> 25:18.923

Well, here.

- Mr. Miller!

25:56.480 --> 25:58.265
Mr. Miller, do you have anything to say

25:58.290 --> 25:59.602
to Peter Wallace's parents? No, no.

and I'd do it again!

26:08.561 --> 26:10.025
Get out of my way!

26:10.049 --> 26:12.750
And there you have it, Mr. Miller...

26:25.667 --> 26:27.805
Are you kidding me?

26:27.830 --> 26:31.158
Mr. Simms, I am not condoning what he did,

26:31.183 --> 26:34.894
but Peter Wallace will
die without a transplant.

26:34.919 --> 26:37.406

nothing like a colonoscopy.
