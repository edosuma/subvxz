WEBVTT

00:34.141 --> 00:36.610
Water, please.

00:41.526 --> 00:43.563
(Pants)

00:43.598 --> 00:45.634
That's enough for that bastard, Newt.

00:47.305 --> 00:51.114
Newt, is it? These your brothers?

00:52.452 --> 00:58.289
Me, them two there,
and Bige here's a cousin.

00:58.324 --> 00:59.726
Shut your gob, boy.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.659
Cousin, of course.

01:02.693 --> 01:05.865
All these quaint towns.
So many families sharing the same name.

01:05.901 --> 01:08.038
Not surprising, really.

01:08.073 --> 01:10.446
(Spits)

01:11.515 --> 01:13.386
You can finish shining it later.

01:17.366 --> 01:21.272
You know, Ben, it's still
a ways to Fort Lee.

01:21.308 --> 01:23.407
I mean, a man could
fall off that wagon,

01:23.439 --> 01:25.475
hit his head on a rock.

01:27.514 --> 01:29.685
Scott should have us scouting ahead.

01:29.718 --> 01:31.786
Yeah?

01:31.819 --> 01:34.588
But I think he likes you too much
to let you out of his sight.

01:34.623 --> 01:37.293
- (Laughs)
- You're such an arsehole.

01:37.328 --> 01:39.930
Yeah, only to my friends.

01:39.964 --> 01:41.796
Hey, what if he trips
while taking a piss?

01:41.830 --> 01:43.195
Hold on, shh. Shut up.

01:43.231 --> 01:46.597
- Listen.
- (Faint rustling)

01:46.630 --> 01:48.962
- Something's coming.
- Infantry or patrol?

01:48.996 --> 01:51.230
Ah, I can't tell through this soup.

01:52.233 --> 01:54.471
Defensive positions.

01:55.375 --> 01:56.977
(Grunts)

02:13.665 --> 02:16.936
Hold your fire!

02:18.537 --> 02:20.871
Dear God.

02:23.607 --> 02:25.543
You.

02:25.577 --> 02:28.610
- What's your regiment?
- My bounty's up.

02:28.645 --> 02:31.848
You're 2nd Virginia. I thought
they were at Fort Lee.

02:31.883 --> 02:33.216
Yes, sir, we were.

02:33.251 --> 02:36.354
You were?

02:36.389 --> 02:41.191
The general ordered Fort Washington
abandoned, but Colonel Magaw held fast.

02:41.226 --> 02:44.096
We watched the redcoats take it
from across the river.

02:44.130 --> 02:48.535
- Then they came over in boats.
- They took Fort Lee as well?

02:48.568 --> 02:50.102
Well, where's the army now?

02:50.136 --> 02:51.939
Where?

02:51.972 --> 02:54.375
Gone. They're gone, captured.

02:54.408 --> 02:57.576
Washington, too, they say.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.582
Don't go that way.

03:01.616 --> 03:03.951
I beg you, don't go that way.

03:10.889 --> 03:13.357
By all means, let us continue!

03:13.392 --> 03:15.725
To New York!

03:17.260 --> 03:19.529
<i>â™ª Hush, hush â™ª</i>

03:19.563 --> 03:21.860
<i>â™ª There's snakes in the garden â™ª</i>

03:21.895 --> 03:25.029
<i>â™ª Soul for sale â™ª</i>

03:25.062 --> 03:27.897
<i>â™ª Blood on the rise â™ª</i>

03:29.566 --> 03:31.566
<i>â™ª Hush, hush â™ª</i>

03:31.600 --> 03:35.635
<i>- â™ª I can't wait anymore â™ª
- â™ª Soul for sale... â™ª</i>

03:37.269 --> 03:40.972
<i>â™ª I can't wait anymore â™ª</i>

03:43.306 --> 03:46.311
<i>â™ª Hush, hush â™ª</i>

03:49.569 --> 03:52.606
We should make Oyster Bay
by midday,

03:52.640 --> 03:54.509
Brooklyn Ferry by early evening,

03:54.543 --> 03:56.276
and then across to New York Island.

03:56.309 --> 03:58.076
Where we'll meet your contact.

03:58.110 --> 04:00.646
Yes, a senior man in the
commissary department.

04:00.680 --> 04:02.580
Well-connected, if tight
with his guineas.

04:02.616 --> 04:04.883
But together we will open his purse.

04:04.918 --> 04:07.600
Are you sure we shouldn't wait until
after Thomas' memorial service?

04:07.622 --> 04:09.824
- (Coos)
- No, not you, lad.

04:09.860 --> 04:14.134
He's talking about his elder
brother, your uncle and namesake.

04:16.007 --> 04:18.345
We'll be back in plenty of time.

04:20.512 --> 04:22.478
You.

04:22.513 --> 04:24.513
You have a job to do.

04:24.548 --> 04:26.045
Look after your mother, Sprout.

04:26.080 --> 04:28.446
Oh, we'll be fine.

04:28.480 --> 04:30.851
And in New York. I'm jealous.

04:30.885 --> 04:33.791
I expect I'll find it much changed.

04:33.827 --> 04:38.629
Oh, well, not all change
seems for the best at first.

04:38.663 --> 04:40.868
But sometimes you just have
to look at it with new eyes.

04:54.455 --> 04:57.562
We're all for the cause,
but we don't want trouble here.

04:57.596 --> 05:01.197
We'll only be here for a night
or two, then we'll move on.

05:01.231 --> 05:04.170
Your hospitality shall be rewarded,
I assure you.

05:04.205 --> 05:07.440
We don't require no reward.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.012
Just no trouble.

05:09.046 --> 05:12.246
You'll have none from us.

05:13.582 --> 05:15.849
Sir?

05:15.884 --> 05:17.851
I showed your men the way.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.618
If the flying camp is where
I think it will be,

05:19.653 --> 05:22.854
then they should return
with an escort by Monday.

05:22.889 --> 05:25.088
Let's hope we don't
wear out our welcome.

05:25.122 --> 05:27.525
Sir, I...

05:29.027 --> 05:32.865
with the loss of those forts,
I should think

05:32.900 --> 05:35.738
that we need friendly eyes in
New York now more than ever.

05:35.772 --> 05:38.107
If you would just give us another chance,
I'm sure that my source...

05:38.142 --> 05:41.246
Have you forgotten the sight of those
poor wretches coming out of the woods?

05:41.281 --> 05:44.484
That's the true threat we're facing.

05:44.519 --> 05:48.859
What happens when officers
disobey their orders.

05:48.892 --> 05:51.031
You should've been
scouting the enemy's lines,

05:51.065 --> 05:53.475
not conscripting men
for a rogue operation

05:53.509 --> 05:55.866
and torturing a captured officer...

05:58.139 --> 06:00.908
I told you that I could
have you court-martialed

06:00.943 --> 06:03.848
But right now I can't
afford to lose an officer,

06:03.883 --> 06:05.687
even a misguided one.

06:05.721 --> 06:08.656
You shall face discipline
when we reach camp,

06:08.691 --> 06:10.624
the severity of which
may be tempered

06:10.660 --> 06:12.961
by your ability to follow
orders from here on out.

06:12.995 --> 06:16.665
Yes, sir. I'll have my men scout
the area while we wait for word.

06:16.699 --> 06:18.770
Very well.

06:23.341 --> 06:26.180
"Scout the area"?

06:26.214 --> 06:28.716
A large area.

06:28.751 --> 06:32.885
Get to Abe. See if he's
found out anything new.

06:32.920 --> 06:35.389
The plan is that we wait
for him to post a signal,

06:35.423 --> 06:37.158
then I make contact.

06:37.192 --> 06:39.663
Yeah, well, change of plans.

06:39.696 --> 06:43.801
- My boat's laid up.
- Then use someone else's.

06:48.759 --> 06:51.008
- Grant to pass.
- (Bleating)

06:51.042 --> 06:53.779
Hold up right there.

06:53.815 --> 06:55.485
(Bleating continues)

06:57.825 --> 06:59.659
What's your business in New York?

06:59.695 --> 07:02.232
Our business is providing pork
to feed the king's soldiers.

07:02.268 --> 07:04.573
King's officers, maybe.

07:04.607 --> 07:07.443
Can't remember what a good
chop tastes like, myself.

07:07.478 --> 07:08.878
Where's your livestock?

07:08.913 --> 07:10.215
This is strictly a selling trip.

07:10.249 --> 07:12.953
Here is my buyer's bona fides.

07:12.986 --> 07:15.390
You will note the commissary seal.

07:26.439 --> 07:28.874
Wait here.

07:32.717 --> 07:36.090
- Some chicken?
- Uh, no, maybe later.

07:43.937 --> 07:48.175
I remember a certain barmaid
used to work at that tavern.

07:48.209 --> 07:50.578
She would pour you an ale
while sporting her "dairy"

07:50.613 --> 07:55.184
in a manner that made you wonder
which beverage was on offer.

07:55.220 --> 07:58.524
"Her virtues,
graced with external gifts,

07:58.557 --> 08:01.797
do breed love's
settled passions in my heart."

08:01.830 --> 08:03.966
We're still speaking
of her tits, right?

08:04.000 --> 08:05.535
(Both laugh)

08:05.569 --> 08:07.570
No, I'm glad to hear
that all your college learning

08:07.573 --> 08:09.806
isn't buried under
cabbage and manure.

08:09.842 --> 08:12.746
Perhaps we could drop by your
alma mater while we're here.

08:12.779 --> 08:14.851
Look, if this is about me
not pursuing the law...

08:14.885 --> 08:17.753
No, no, no, I was
merely thinking that,

08:17.786 --> 08:21.225
in the interests of carving
a path for your son,

08:21.259 --> 08:25.532
- you might endeavor to...
- Yes, my son.

08:25.567 --> 08:28.272
And thank you for noting
that Thomas is mine,

08:28.305 --> 08:30.505
that I'm responsible for his future.

08:33.009 --> 08:34.980
It's a task I don't take lightly.

08:35.015 --> 08:38.557
I see how you dote on him.

08:38.590 --> 08:41.860
I wonder if perhaps
I should've done the same.

08:41.894 --> 08:45.200
You want what's best for your son.

08:45.235 --> 08:47.036
So do I.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.113
You can go.

08:52.149 --> 08:53.415
Thank you.

08:53.449 --> 08:56.017
You, there! Move that mutton!

08:56.051 --> 08:57.889
- (Farmer whistles)
- (Sheep bleating)

08:57.923 --> 09:00.525
Ho.

09:02.560 --> 09:04.562
REDCOAT:
Whose sheep are these?

09:04.597 --> 09:07.099
FARMER: Not my sheep, sir.
Dog's mine, though.

09:14.745 --> 09:16.717
Where the hell are you going?

09:16.752 --> 09:19.657
I think you mean, "Where the hell
am I going, Lieutenant?"

09:19.690 --> 09:22.163
To ride ahead.

09:22.197 --> 09:23.665
Make sure we're not jumped by patrol.

09:23.700 --> 09:25.436
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:25.470 --> 09:27.404
- What about us?
- CALEB: Youse?

09:27.440 --> 09:30.272
Your orders are to stay here,

09:30.305 --> 09:31.573
keep your eyes peeled for skulkers.

09:31.609 --> 09:33.911
- Our "orders," huh?
- Yeah.

09:33.943 --> 09:37.484
And how do we know these ain't shams
like the ones Tallmadge gave us?

09:37.518 --> 09:38.951
Because I'm telling you.

09:38.987 --> 09:41.490
So shut your holes,
do your watches.

09:41.525 --> 09:43.661
(Clicks tongue)

09:48.099 --> 09:51.170
We'll never see him again.

09:51.203 --> 09:54.474
He's desertin'.

09:54.510 --> 09:56.278
Maybe he's got the right idea.

09:56.313 --> 10:00.318
That Virginia man
said they got Washington.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.619
What if he's dead?

10:02.651 --> 10:05.054
Then this fight is almost done.

10:05.089 --> 10:08.496
And we're on the wrong side
of the gallows.

10:08.530 --> 10:10.665
Unless we do something about that.

10:10.699 --> 10:13.372
- Like what?
- (Spits)

10:22.655 --> 10:24.188
Put one of these on.

10:24.223 --> 10:26.560
Loyalist refugees
are pouring into the city

10:26.595 --> 10:28.029
now that Howe has secured it.

10:28.064 --> 10:30.238
Rebel deserters, too.

10:30.271 --> 10:33.041
This will let the local authorities
know our leaning at a glance.

10:33.075 --> 10:35.948
Yeah, why not a little
Union Jack as well?

10:35.981 --> 10:38.616
Well, perhaps you can
suggest that to the general,

10:38.651 --> 10:40.954
should we happen to run across him.

10:40.989 --> 10:44.826
There she is, New York Island.

11:00.114 --> 11:02.548
(Chatter)

11:26.692 --> 11:29.878
Oh, my, what an 'andsome pair
of gentlemen.

11:29.953 --> 11:31.292
Is that your son?

11:31.326 --> 11:32.798
How's about I introduce him
to my daughter

11:32.832 --> 11:34.800
for a little family get-together?

11:34.835 --> 11:37.439
Maybe later.

11:37.473 --> 11:39.309
WOMAN:
We'll be here, darlin'.

11:39.344 --> 11:41.245
- "Maybe later"?
- (Chuckles)

11:41.279 --> 11:44.681
Woodhull! Judge Woodhull!

11:46.284 --> 11:48.053
I didn't know your
contract was military.

11:48.088 --> 11:49.623
They're the best kind
of contract to have.

11:49.659 --> 11:51.728
Magistrate.
(Chuckles)

11:51.763 --> 11:55.503
You're a sight for sore eyes
and a salivating palate.

11:55.538 --> 11:57.274
Brought the bacon, have we?

11:57.308 --> 12:00.677
Only my son, Abraham, my new
business representative.

12:00.711 --> 12:02.616
Does that mean we won't be
trading directly anymore?

12:02.652 --> 12:05.186
Matters at home increasingly
require my attention,

12:05.221 --> 12:07.923
but you can trust my son
in all of my affairs.

12:07.957 --> 12:12.231
Yes. But can I trust him in mine?

12:15.169 --> 12:18.545
(Laughs)
Call me Jonathan.

12:22.217 --> 12:24.488
Ugh! Yow!

12:41.488 --> 12:44.055
(Water sloshing)

12:45.825 --> 12:48.295
Setauket? See-tauket?

12:48.330 --> 12:49.730
What's that mean?
It's like in Indian, right?

12:49.764 --> 12:51.731
You need to stop talking
so damn loud, all right?

12:51.763 --> 12:54.168
Just stay with the boat
and wait for my signal.

12:54.204 --> 12:55.404
- Your signal?
- Yeah.

12:55.437 --> 12:57.874
Owl, right?
(Hooting)

12:58.808 --> 13:00.546
Whoo-hoo...

13:00.580 --> 13:04.280
I'll signal. You just listen.

13:04.315 --> 13:06.716
Try not to wet yourself.

13:16.565 --> 13:18.735
DRIVER:
Whoa.

13:21.441 --> 13:23.705
Hup.

14:11.853 --> 14:14.018
(Whispers)
Abraham?

14:17.559 --> 14:18.993
Abraham?

14:19.026 --> 14:23.504
(Laughing)
Howdy.

14:23.538 --> 14:26.203
Your cauliflower looks
like it's coming on nice.

14:26.239 --> 14:29.713
- You got any ready to eat?
- (Both laugh)

14:29.747 --> 14:30.807
Bollocks!

14:30.825 --> 14:32.661
Do you want the whole garrison
to hear you?

14:32.697 --> 14:34.315
Do you know for a fact
that he's in New York?

14:34.324 --> 14:36.929
By now he should be.

14:36.963 --> 14:39.067
One of Richard's hands told one of
mine they left early this morning.

14:39.103 --> 14:41.171
(Laughs)
Oh, God.

14:41.206 --> 14:42.974
There's a word for this, Annie.

14:43.009 --> 14:45.047
There is a damnable word.

14:45.081 --> 14:47.602
Mm, I'm guessing, then, that you
haven't exhausted your lexicon.

14:47.616 --> 14:50.522
Ironic. Yeah.

14:50.558 --> 14:52.826
Now, I may have not gone to Yale,

14:52.861 --> 14:55.264
but I did screw a well-read
woman in New Haven.

14:55.298 --> 14:58.002
And this is ironic that
that little skinny bastard

14:58.036 --> 15:00.874
is in New York
right where I want him,

15:00.910 --> 15:03.445
only instead of
procuring intelligence,

15:03.480 --> 15:05.617
that little shite is selling hogs.

15:05.652 --> 15:08.785
(Scoffs)

15:08.820 --> 15:11.455
- You need information.
- Yeah.

15:11.490 --> 15:13.490
Maybe we can still get it.

15:15.626 --> 15:16.804
"We"?

15:16.882 --> 15:19.372
You'd be surprised
what spills out of a soldier's mouth

15:19.408 --> 15:20.802
when I lower the price of ale.

15:20.835 --> 15:23.306
And their rooms can yield up
secrets of their own,

15:23.340 --> 15:25.242
- as I've already found.
- No, Annie, no.

15:25.278 --> 15:27.180
- I'm sorry.
- Stop calling me Annie.

15:27.214 --> 15:30.817
- And why not?
- Because it's not the thing, all right?

15:30.852 --> 15:32.221
Because I'm a woman.

15:32.255 --> 15:35.291
Well, yeah, because you're a woman.

15:35.325 --> 15:37.093
And this is men's work.

15:37.129 --> 15:39.966
Oh, so you don't mind me
pinning up a few petticoats

15:40.000 --> 15:42.036
and you're happy to hide
out here in my barn,

15:42.072 --> 15:44.039
but having me do anything more

15:44.074 --> 15:46.109
offends your delicate notions
of a woman's proper place,

15:46.143 --> 15:48.345
which appears to be
suffering under your bulk?

15:48.380 --> 15:50.549
Oh, that is when they're
not improving your English.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.884
So this must be marriage, then.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.559
Caleb Brewster, I can't think
of a man in these parts

15:55.593 --> 15:58.999
braver and more capable than
half of the women I know.

15:59.032 --> 16:01.735
- Annie, all I'm saying is...
- What happened to Captain Simcoe?

16:01.769 --> 16:04.978
- Simcoe?
- His body wasn't recovered.

16:05.011 --> 16:08.781
Annie... uh, Anna.

16:10.284 --> 16:12.519
I-I'm sorry about what
happened to your husband.

16:12.554 --> 16:14.388
Simcoe.

16:14.422 --> 16:17.694
You promised Abraham
you'd send him to his reward.

16:17.729 --> 16:20.162
We planned to...

16:20.196 --> 16:23.168
after we questioned him, but...

16:23.202 --> 16:26.339
the plan went wrong.
Now he's in custody of...

16:26.372 --> 16:27.907
- Get out.
- Come on.

16:27.942 --> 16:30.373
- Get out!
- All right.

16:30.407 --> 16:34.413
If you can't keep a promise,
then I can't trust you here.

16:36.582 --> 16:37.882
Out.

16:37.917 --> 16:39.454
You know, Annie,

16:39.489 --> 16:41.591
you're still pretty when you're angry.

16:41.626 --> 16:42.959
All right.

16:42.994 --> 16:44.629
(Quietly)
Get out.

16:55.983 --> 16:58.150
COOK:
To the four hinges of friendship...

16:58.184 --> 17:02.190
swearing, lying,
stealing, and drinking.

17:02.224 --> 17:04.361
- Hear, hear.
- (Chuckles)

17:08.101 --> 17:10.237
Now to business.

17:10.270 --> 17:12.875
The army has plenty of wine,

17:12.911 --> 17:15.078
but little meat to pair it with,

17:15.111 --> 17:16.445
thanks to the damn rebels.

17:16.482 --> 17:19.251
And you, sir, have hogs.

17:19.287 --> 17:22.759
25 fat hogs ready
for the butcher's knife.

17:22.791 --> 17:26.796
And since we both know that the army
is indeed desperate for fresh meat,

17:26.829 --> 17:29.397
my price is eight pounds per pound.

17:29.431 --> 17:31.868
Desperate they may be,
but at that price,

17:31.902 --> 17:34.937
I suspect they'd rather
eat shoe leather.

17:34.972 --> 17:37.407
I could go five, but no higher.

17:37.441 --> 17:40.409
Well, I could get that price at home.

17:40.445 --> 17:42.413
No. Seven.

17:43.779 --> 17:46.318
I'm sorry you came
all this way, Richard.

17:46.352 --> 17:49.720
Still, it's always good to get
out of town once in a while.

17:56.865 --> 17:59.167
Uh...

17:59.202 --> 18:01.436
my father's price is too low.

18:03.409 --> 18:05.779
His original price.

18:08.318 --> 18:12.324
I've seen army suppliers
at work in Long Island.

18:12.359 --> 18:14.428
They requisition horse and wagon,

18:14.462 --> 18:17.565
pay far less than the official
rate, then pocket the difference.

18:19.971 --> 18:21.606
Is that a fact?

18:22.841 --> 18:25.112
It's just an idea.

18:25.147 --> 18:28.249
Let's say that you buy
25 hogs from us today,

18:28.284 --> 18:32.389
and then tomorrow you sell
35 to the quartermaster.

18:32.424 --> 18:34.460
Sell 10 hogs I don't have?

18:34.494 --> 18:36.395
And then you split the extra
profit with your buyer,

18:36.429 --> 18:39.263
who makes sure the
count suits the bill.

18:39.298 --> 18:42.734
So, I'd say take his compromise

18:42.769 --> 18:47.639
or we can go find a quartermaster of
our own, do our business directly.

18:52.344 --> 18:55.748
Richard, do you wish to hazard
our relationship in this way?

18:55.781 --> 19:00.050
As I said, I trust my son
in all my affairs.

19:01.922 --> 19:05.593
I feel you have a gloomy view
of human nature, young man.

19:06.997 --> 19:10.034
- I'm the son of a judge.
- (Both laugh)

19:12.705 --> 19:15.709
(Laughing)

19:19.617 --> 19:22.889
Well said.

19:22.923 --> 19:24.355
Seven it is.

19:27.862 --> 19:32.334
Now I'd like to discuss those additional
resources we spoke of last month.

19:32.368 --> 19:34.706
Cauliflower, wasn't it?

19:34.741 --> 19:39.480
Fresh vegetables are almost as
valuable as fresh meat these days.

19:39.513 --> 19:41.918
When did you start
planting cauliflower?

19:41.952 --> 19:44.755
Oh, not his.
From some rebel's field.

19:44.788 --> 19:46.956
I think that's enough
business for one night.

19:46.991 --> 19:48.858
Why don't we take
what's left of your Picolit

19:48.893 --> 19:50.994
and adjourn
to your splendid balcony?

19:51.028 --> 19:54.098
A splendid suggestion.

20:02.807 --> 20:07.043
(Water sloshing)

20:07.079 --> 20:10.481
Where'd he go, hmm?

20:10.516 --> 20:12.252
Where'd he go?

20:15.560 --> 20:18.830
(Distant owl hooting)

20:18.865 --> 20:20.835
Want more potatoes, Captain?

20:20.868 --> 20:22.904
Yes, thank you.

20:22.938 --> 20:24.804
Won't your husband be joining us?

20:24.838 --> 20:27.073
If he can. He's tending a sick cow.

20:27.109 --> 20:31.415
This ale is rather good.
As is the mutton.

20:31.451 --> 20:34.455
My compliments on your
hospitality, General.

20:34.489 --> 20:36.627
You know, you would do better
to compliment our hosts,

20:36.661 --> 20:38.294
who are sharing
their table with a man

20:38.328 --> 20:40.332
who would surely kill them
without a second thought.

20:40.365 --> 20:42.101
Only if ordered to.

20:42.137 --> 20:44.773
We must all obey
our orders, mustn't we?

20:44.808 --> 20:47.311
Perhaps, Captain, you should avoid

20:47.345 --> 20:49.982
antagonizing both your
hosts and your captors.

20:50.017 --> 20:53.018
My apologies, of course.

20:53.051 --> 20:56.656
Sir, there's a company
coming in from the north.

20:56.692 --> 20:58.693
- Regulars?
- Tory militia, we think.

20:58.727 --> 21:02.431
- Oh, God.
- Madam, please.

21:06.668 --> 21:10.873
(Humming "March of the Grenadiers")

21:18.485 --> 21:21.485
(Guns click)

21:21.520 --> 21:23.421
- What's this?
- Change of plans.

21:23.455 --> 21:25.360
New order of battle.

21:25.395 --> 21:27.597
We're taking you two and
your prisoner to New York,

21:27.631 --> 21:32.004
where we'll exchange you for
full pardons and hard coin.

21:32.037 --> 21:35.309
This is mutiny.
This... this is madness.

21:35.343 --> 21:36.945
This is New Jersey.

21:36.979 --> 21:39.849
We serve the colony
of Pennsylvania, sir,

21:39.885 --> 21:43.023
and we've been lured here
under false orders.

21:43.057 --> 21:45.225
- Eben, you're making...
- Shut up.

21:47.096 --> 21:51.169
We can take you dead,
alive, or wounded.

21:51.203 --> 21:55.307
I'll give you to the count of
five to choose your preference.

21:56.344 --> 21:58.415
One, two...

21:58.448 --> 22:01.619
- (Fires)
- (Grunts)

22:01.653 --> 22:03.154
(Yells)

22:04.760 --> 22:06.429
Gideon!

22:10.569 --> 22:12.375
EBEN:
Newt!

22:12.408 --> 22:15.477
- (Groans)
- (Cocks gun)

22:19.215 --> 22:21.351
- Thanks for dinner.
- Oh, damn it!

22:23.719 --> 22:27.024
You men! Fall under my command!

22:27.059 --> 22:29.194
(Groans)

22:30.460 --> 22:31.661
You in there?

22:31.695 --> 22:33.864
It's still three guns to one.

22:33.900 --> 22:37.070
You can be prisoners
or you can be dead.

22:37.105 --> 22:39.442
Think it over.

22:51.249 --> 22:52.980
Oh.

22:53.014 --> 22:57.113
Mr. Baker, I brought your coat in
so it wouldn't get damp.

22:57.147 --> 22:59.449
BAKER:
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Woodhull.

23:01.284 --> 23:03.381
Wait, there's a stain on your shirt.

23:03.416 --> 23:06.450
Well, as long as the jacket stays on,
no one will be the wiser.

23:06.485 --> 23:08.353
Just hold still.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.284
Mrs. Woodhull,
you really don't have to...

23:10.319 --> 23:11.883
I'm a wife and a mother.

23:11.917 --> 23:14.981
Sometimes I think half my life
is spent doing laundry.

23:15.016 --> 23:18.313
Not that Abraham much cares
what he throws on each morning.

23:18.348 --> 23:19.815
Oh, he's a good man, your husband.

23:19.850 --> 23:21.882
Always says hello
when he goes by the tavern.

23:24.050 --> 23:26.084
- The Strong tavern?
- Aye.

23:26.119 --> 23:29.984
My sentry post is right there.

23:30.018 --> 23:33.455
Have you seen him there much
since Selah Strong's arrest?

23:33.490 --> 23:35.854
A few times, I suppose.

23:38.056 --> 23:42.657
- There, no stains.
- Thank you.

23:58.577 --> 24:00.378
You got any ale
to wash this down with?

24:00.413 --> 24:03.282
- This isn't my tavern.
- (Chuckles)

24:03.316 --> 24:04.784
Some cider, then. I'm not choosy.

24:04.819 --> 24:06.717
Have you chosen a means of escape?

24:06.751 --> 24:10.453
Actually, I could use
your help on that score.

24:10.488 --> 24:12.189
You mean a woman's help?

24:12.223 --> 24:14.524
Right.

24:16.193 --> 24:20.230
Ahem, Mrs. Strong, I would
be eternally grateful

24:20.264 --> 24:22.761
if a brave and capable woman
such as yourself

24:22.795 --> 24:25.361
could go down to the wharf
and see if there might be

24:25.396 --> 24:28.295
any unattended boats
that I could borrow.

24:28.329 --> 24:30.795
If only to get me out of your hair...

24:30.829 --> 24:32.530
and your barn.

24:32.564 --> 24:38.098
Well, Mr. Brewster,
since you asked so nicely,

24:38.132 --> 24:40.034
I'll see what I can do.

24:43.303 --> 24:46.670
I'm sorry about Simcoe.

24:46.704 --> 24:48.503
I suppose when Abe finds out,

24:48.539 --> 24:50.572
he won't be so keen
on spying for us anymore.

24:50.607 --> 24:53.574
I'm not sure he would be anyway.

24:53.609 --> 24:59.597
He told me he's done with this
"double life," as he called it.

25:01.250 --> 25:03.618
(Groans)

25:04.818 --> 25:06.149
Why don't we rush 'em?

25:06.185 --> 25:07.550
You anxious to get shot?

25:07.585 --> 25:09.117
We got time.

25:09.152 --> 25:11.453
(Groaning)

25:11.487 --> 25:14.757
The farmer's gonna die
unless he gets a doctor.

25:14.791 --> 25:18.092
- (Groaning continues)
- You want his blood on your hands?

25:20.261 --> 25:21.927
I need to be with my husband.

25:21.963 --> 25:25.928
Mrs. Standish, please just
stay calm and stay down.

25:33.435 --> 25:36.304
BEN:
Corporal Bascombe.

25:36.338 --> 25:38.738
Newt.

25:38.773 --> 25:42.939
You and your brothers, you're
from Donegal, aren't you?

25:42.974 --> 25:45.440
What of it?

25:45.475 --> 25:49.245
Well, sounds a lot like
the place that I'm from...

25:49.280 --> 25:53.882
small farm town, very peaceful.

25:53.916 --> 25:57.717
That is, until
the king's men marched in

25:57.751 --> 26:00.682
and turned the church
into his stables.

26:00.716 --> 26:03.679
Hung anyone with
the courage to object.

26:03.715 --> 26:06.615
You know, the same thing
will happen to your town

26:06.649 --> 26:10.618
unless we stand together
and resist them.

26:10.652 --> 26:14.017
The good captain is happy
to sell you this bilge,

26:14.050 --> 26:16.550
but mark me, the truth is,
you and your brothers

26:16.584 --> 26:18.685
will end up rotting
in unmarked graves

26:18.720 --> 26:23.154
while your meager fields are added
to some wealthy general's holdings.

26:23.187 --> 26:25.822
Some Continental general.

26:25.856 --> 26:30.123
No, that's what the enemy believes.

26:30.158 --> 26:33.494
But they're fighting for a king.

26:33.529 --> 26:36.462
You and I are fighting
for our homes,

26:36.497 --> 26:39.698
for our families, for our freedom.

26:39.731 --> 26:43.301
Just remember your oath, Newt.

26:43.335 --> 26:46.669
Stand aside when this matter
plays out and I promise you...

26:47.971 --> 26:50.272
That's enough talk!

26:50.307 --> 26:52.740
(Panting)

26:52.773 --> 26:56.275
This war will be a short one.

26:56.311 --> 27:00.177
Our host affects a raffish charm,
but he's a cunning trader.

27:00.210 --> 27:03.279
You may think that you called
him on his scheme tonight,

27:03.311 --> 27:07.180
but I think it was just a test
to see how well you play the game.

27:07.215 --> 27:11.380
He'll keep you on your toes, for sure.

27:11.414 --> 27:13.649
Did you arrange to sell
Selah Strong's crop

27:13.684 --> 27:17.221
before or after you
sought your attainder?

27:17.255 --> 27:19.522
Because the timing
argues for the former.

27:19.556 --> 27:22.140
What difference does it make?
His property will soon be forfeit.

27:22.176 --> 27:23.932
"What difference does it make"?

27:23.966 --> 27:26.496
The difference marks you
as a sharper trader than Cook,

27:26.530 --> 27:29.164
having already sold
Selah's crop as your own.

27:29.199 --> 27:32.568
His fields will be distributed
equitably among his loyal neighbors.

27:32.602 --> 27:34.169
"Equitably"?

27:34.205 --> 27:36.539
You mean conveniently,
per your buyer's needs.

27:36.572 --> 27:39.907
It's curious that when other so-called
patriots' property is seized,

27:39.941 --> 27:42.177
you raised no objections.

27:42.211 --> 27:44.511
But I'm guessing your interest
in this case is more personal.

27:44.547 --> 27:48.161
All these confiscations achieve
is to create more Selahs,

27:48.196 --> 27:49.780
more Ben Tallmadges,
prolonging the war.

27:49.815 --> 27:52.146
There is no war without an army,
and Washington's is finished.

27:52.181 --> 27:54.714
- You underestimate them.
- Perhaps I overestimated you.

27:54.749 --> 27:57.716
I thought I caught a glimpse tonight

27:57.750 --> 28:01.116
of a man I would be proud
to call my son.

28:01.150 --> 28:04.348
But it seems you can't put your
childhood attachments behind you.

28:04.382 --> 28:07.515
Anna Strong is not your family.

28:07.549 --> 28:10.249
Mary and Thomas are.
Now honor your responsibilities

28:10.284 --> 28:13.604
- as your brother would've done.
- (Loudly) Thomas is dead.

28:16.719 --> 28:18.988
And I wed her to honor
your responsibilities.

28:19.022 --> 28:21.157
Then accept your decision
and stand by them.

28:21.192 --> 28:24.362
Prove you're a worthy man
and a worthy husband

28:24.395 --> 28:26.831
instead of a petulant boy
who can't admit that he's here

28:26.866 --> 28:28.897
because he can't take care
of his own family.

28:34.802 --> 28:37.005
(Door slams)

28:45.847 --> 28:48.315
(Distant chatter)

28:53.620 --> 28:56.823
(Cheering)

28:56.858 --> 29:01.026
("March of the Grenadiers"
playing in background)

29:16.872 --> 29:22.226
__

29:38.577 --> 29:40.948
(Voices chanting)
Liberty, not tyranny!

29:40.982 --> 29:43.384
Liberty, not tyranny!

29:45.186 --> 29:46.448
MAN:
Stay back! Stay back!

29:46.482 --> 29:49.217
(Gunshot echoes, screaming)

29:56.085 --> 29:58.719
Hey, you. Are you groggy, or what?

29:58.753 --> 30:00.953
Get your rummy ass home.

30:02.154 --> 30:04.492
(Distant voice shouting in German)

30:12.633 --> 30:15.235
(Speaking German)

30:26.510 --> 30:28.110
German?

30:28.145 --> 30:30.779
(Drill sergeant yelling in German)

30:32.281 --> 30:34.317
Ja.

30:36.689 --> 30:39.456
I'm a cabbage farmer.

30:39.491 --> 30:41.558
I couldn't help wondering
what you're making there.

30:41.592 --> 30:44.529
Sauerkraut.

30:44.563 --> 30:46.930
Have a taste, Yank.

30:48.597 --> 30:50.998
- Mm.
- (Laughing)

30:51.033 --> 30:53.736
- Is good, ja?
- Yeah.

30:57.572 --> 31:00.039
(Drill sergeant yelling)

31:01.844 --> 31:04.646
(Soldiers speaking German)
Link, recht, link, recht...

31:08.880 --> 31:11.862
It's, uh... it's odd
to be drilling this hard

31:11.897 --> 31:13.375
so close to winter, isn't it?

31:13.410 --> 31:15.583
I would've thought the army would
be preparin' to stand down.

31:15.616 --> 31:17.686
English army, maybe.

31:17.719 --> 31:20.584
Our commander is a harder man.

31:20.617 --> 31:22.251
Is a hard man, ja.

31:22.285 --> 31:24.751
They're shipping us out next week.

31:24.785 --> 31:29.920
- The whole brigade.
- That's too bad, for both of us.

31:29.953 --> 31:33.589
I have a whole crop
of cabbage to sell.

31:33.622 --> 31:35.920
Any way I could get it to you?

31:35.954 --> 31:39.790
Well, how well
do you know New Jersey?

31:41.292 --> 31:43.855
It's a place called Tren... Tran...

31:43.890 --> 31:45.991
- Trenton?
- Ja.

31:46.024 --> 31:47.459
I know it.

31:47.495 --> 31:48.762
Can you deliver there?

31:48.797 --> 31:51.399
I'll see what I can do.

32:11.691 --> 32:14.957
(Distant chatter)

32:27.785 --> 32:30.017
MARY:
Anna?

32:32.521 --> 32:36.185
Mary, what are you doing
out here at this hour?

32:36.221 --> 32:37.952
Looking for you.

32:37.986 --> 32:40.416
Oh.

32:42.583 --> 32:46.382
I know what you've been doing.

32:46.417 --> 32:48.249
It's time we talked,
don't you think?

32:48.284 --> 32:50.989
Did you know that Abraham's
brother Thomas and I

32:51.024 --> 32:52.624
were originally
supposed to be married?

32:52.658 --> 32:54.292
Yes, I did.

32:54.327 --> 32:57.560
Abraham's father
and mine arranged it.

32:57.594 --> 32:59.730
I only met Thomas once,
but, by all accounts,

32:59.763 --> 33:03.332
he was a very admirable man.

33:03.367 --> 33:07.235
It was tragic how he died,

33:07.268 --> 33:10.738
but I respect Abraham honoring
his family's agreement.

33:10.774 --> 33:13.007
You respect him?

33:13.039 --> 33:15.536
Respect, trust, responsibility.

33:15.571 --> 33:18.638
I would say that's what's
important for a good marriage.

33:18.674 --> 33:22.141
And children, of course.

33:22.175 --> 33:25.607
I know Abraham is a passionate man,

33:25.641 --> 33:28.906
and if he chooses to exercise that
passion outside of his marriage,

33:28.942 --> 33:32.571
then I will consent as long as you
agree to limit your time together

33:32.606 --> 33:34.271
and ensure that it stays a secret.

33:34.305 --> 33:37.439
Abraham is a good provider and father

33:37.473 --> 33:40.607
and I don't want his name besmirched
any more than I do my own.

33:40.641 --> 33:45.710
I am not having an affair
with your husband.

33:45.744 --> 33:48.578
Nor have I entertained
romantic feelings for him

33:48.612 --> 33:51.043
since he broke off our engagement.

33:52.044 --> 33:54.211
Your engagement?

33:54.246 --> 33:58.811
We were engaged, secretly,

33:58.845 --> 34:02.573
before he decided that honoring
his father's agreement

34:02.608 --> 34:04.672
was more important
than his vow to me.

34:04.707 --> 34:06.641
I don't believe it.

34:08.174 --> 34:10.670
No?

34:10.706 --> 34:13.007
Why don't you ask Abraham?

34:13.041 --> 34:16.275
Or, better yet, ask his father.

34:27.818 --> 34:31.452
(Mrs. Standish sobbing)

34:36.018 --> 34:39.284
You in there! We're done waiting.

34:39.320 --> 34:42.887
Come out unarmed
or we come in shooting.

34:46.353 --> 34:47.987
(Clicks)

34:48.023 --> 34:50.152
He's bluffing.

34:51.388 --> 34:53.485
No, I don't think so.

34:53.518 --> 34:55.585
We either fight him in here
or out there.

34:55.619 --> 35:00.824
(Chuckles) And trust your entreaties
have improved our odds?

35:03.959 --> 35:06.294
(Clicks)

35:08.398 --> 35:10.529
BEN:
We're coming out!

35:10.563 --> 35:13.530
Don't shoot!

35:15.532 --> 35:17.633
Don't shoot.

35:38.070 --> 35:40.804
Newt, get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

35:41.937 --> 35:43.303
(Grunts)

35:48.935 --> 35:51.867
Well done, Captain.

35:51.901 --> 35:53.730
(Simcoe clapping)

36:15.199 --> 36:17.667
- CALEB: So, two sentries on the dock?
- Three.

36:17.702 --> 36:20.003
Three, good.
Three, I can deal with.

36:20.038 --> 36:21.336
You have a plan?

36:21.371 --> 36:22.971
Well, more of an interesting way

36:23.005 --> 36:25.439
of getting myself
killed, but, you know...

36:25.474 --> 36:27.873
I'm trying to think of how
I can improve the odds.

36:27.908 --> 36:29.440
Caleb, if this is too dangerous...

36:29.475 --> 36:32.409
No, don't worry.

36:32.444 --> 36:35.775
Well, unless the truth is
that you're sorry to see me go.

36:35.811 --> 36:38.610
I admit, it's been good to see you.

36:38.643 --> 36:40.508
So many things
have changed around here.

36:40.542 --> 36:43.010
Woody only thinks
he's changed, Annie.

36:43.045 --> 36:46.179
Mostly his problem is that
he married the wrong woman.

36:46.212 --> 36:49.942
- (Door creaks)
- (Gun cocks)

36:49.976 --> 36:51.874
(Whispers)
Anna?

36:51.909 --> 36:55.008
- Abraham!
- Hey, when did you get back into town?

36:55.042 --> 36:57.110
I might ask you the same thing,

36:57.144 --> 36:58.809
although I think I just
got the measure of it.

36:58.844 --> 37:04.078
- You were listening.
- No, I mean, I only caught a bit.

37:04.111 --> 37:06.378
Listen, I...

37:06.412 --> 37:09.509
came here intending to ask
you to hang a petticoat.

37:09.545 --> 37:12.811
I bear gifts from New York.

37:12.846 --> 37:14.278
(Laughs)

37:14.311 --> 37:16.210
What'd you find out?

37:16.243 --> 37:18.780
Well, that while the Royal Army

37:18.814 --> 37:21.046
prepares to stand down
for the winter,

37:21.081 --> 37:25.212
a brigade of Hessian mercenaries
1,500 strong

37:25.246 --> 37:28.315
readies to march to Trenton.

37:29.251 --> 37:32.454
Gold.
(Laughs)

37:32.487 --> 37:33.788
It's gold.

37:33.822 --> 37:36.355
I gotta get this
back to Ben right away.

37:36.390 --> 37:39.524
We'll help get you out.
You can trust me.

37:39.560 --> 37:42.960
I do. I do trust you.

37:42.994 --> 37:44.993
And I need you to trust me.

37:45.029 --> 37:48.862
I think... I think there's
something you should know first.

37:48.898 --> 37:50.762
Let him hear it from me.

37:54.664 --> 37:56.997
Captain Simcoe is dead.

37:58.630 --> 38:02.531
They hid his body to make
it look like he'd run off

38:02.566 --> 38:04.463
like the cowardly blackguard he was.

38:08.668 --> 38:10.434
All right.

38:12.268 --> 38:15.101
- Hey, it's good to see you.
- It's good to see you.

38:15.136 --> 38:17.200
- Let's get you the hell out of here.
- Right.

38:17.235 --> 38:18.802
All right.

39:22.755 --> 39:26.794
Sir... general says to report
as soon as you're able.

39:26.829 --> 39:29.233
SOLDIER:
Set him down.

39:30.537 --> 39:33.005
Washington has escaped
without a scratch.

39:33.039 --> 39:35.777
He is indeed camped
across the Delaware. Here.

39:35.812 --> 39:38.680
Sir, we should discuss this.

39:38.713 --> 39:42.018
Well, I'd love nothing better than
to see these men tried and hanged

39:42.053 --> 39:44.624
as a warning to others who might
consider turning traitor,

39:44.658 --> 39:46.931
but the army has
more pressing concerns.

39:46.965 --> 39:48.766
(Whispers)
Hope you're happy.

39:48.801 --> 39:51.038
(Cocks gun, fires)

39:52.542 --> 39:54.413
General...

39:54.448 --> 39:57.721
the boy was clearly
strong-armed by his brothers.

39:57.755 --> 40:01.231
A trial, yes,
but a summary execution?

40:01.264 --> 40:05.171
Well, I'm not going
to execute him, Captain.

40:05.205 --> 40:07.811
You are.

40:07.845 --> 40:09.847
Sir, I gave him my word.

40:09.882 --> 40:11.381
And I've given you an order.

40:11.416 --> 40:15.225
Obey it or face court-martial.

40:15.259 --> 40:17.595
You have just seen firsthand

40:17.629 --> 40:19.800
what happens when military
discipline breaks down.

40:19.833 --> 40:21.871
Are you telling me
you've learned nothing?

40:21.906 --> 40:24.374
I'll take the court-martial, sir.

40:53.235 --> 40:54.971
ANNA:
Thirsty, gentlemen?

40:55.005 --> 40:57.480
Got left out last night.

40:57.515 --> 40:59.453
Warm, but it's still good.

40:59.488 --> 41:01.123
Thank you, ma'am.

41:32.816 --> 41:34.486
Morning, gentlemen.

41:34.521 --> 41:36.191
Now, unless you'd each
like a third ball,

41:36.226 --> 41:38.661
I suggest you raise sail
and heel away from that sloop.

41:40.263 --> 41:41.865
(Men scream)

41:51.981 --> 41:54.386
Get after him!

41:56.128 --> 41:57.730
Stop him!

41:57.764 --> 42:02.133
<i>â™ª Farewell and adieu to you
fair Spanish ladies... â™ª</i>

42:02.167 --> 42:04.604
(Laughs)

42:04.639 --> 42:08.044
<i>â™ª Farewell and adieu

42:08.078 --> 42:10.613
("Spanish Ladies" continues)
