00:17.005 --> 00:19.673
Okay, I just wanted
to take you through

00:19.756 --> 00:21.964
the main points
of the sexual
harassment complaint

00:22.047 --> 00:24.172
-from your assistant.
-Right. Right. Right.

00:24.255 --> 00:26.631
The first contention is
you yanked at her clothes.

00:26.714 --> 00:29.297
(scoffs) I yanked at her--
I cleaned my glasses.

00:29.381 --> 00:31.172
-Cleaned your glasses.
-Her shirttail
was sticking out.

00:31.255 --> 00:32.839
I cleaned my glasses.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

00:32.923 --> 00:35.631
-Send me to the cooler.
-I don't want you
to worry about it.

00:35.714 --> 00:37.089
I can handle this.

00:37.172 --> 00:40.714
If she gets
anything at all here,
it would be a travesty.

00:40.798 --> 00:43.339
And I would,
I would leave the country.

00:43.422 --> 00:46.130
I don't know where I'd go,
but I would leave.

00:46.214 --> 00:48.839
I hear Canada is
a good place, maybe.

00:48.923 --> 00:51.047
-But it's cold.
-I don't recommend
moving to Canada.

00:51.130 --> 00:54.047
What about-- what about like
a Pacific island or something?

00:54.130 --> 00:57.047
I want to assure you that
as upsetting as this is,

00:57.130 --> 01:00.047
I think we'll either
be able to make it go away

01:00.130 --> 01:02.047
or come to a reasonable
settlement.

01:02.130 --> 01:04.381
-What? Come to a what?
-An amicable arrangement--

01:04.464 --> 01:07.089
A settlement?
A reasonable settlement?

01:07.172 --> 01:10.339
"Millions for defense.
Not one cent for tribute."

01:10.422 --> 01:13.214
That's what we said
when the British were
impressing our seamen.

01:13.297 --> 01:15.714
You, you know they tried
to impress our seamen, right?

01:15.798 --> 01:18.673
They'd be on the ship,
they'd yell across
at one of our ships.

01:18.756 --> 01:23.047
"Hey, there!
We have the best dental plan
in all of Europe.

01:23.130 --> 01:27.047
"Why, look at our bicorn hats
and fancy brass buttons.

01:27.130 --> 01:30.214
How's that, sailors?
Are you impressed by that?"

01:30.297 --> 01:32.130

Yeah. No. I already saw that,

it's...

02:15.589 --> 02:19.130
-an infinitely better bathroom
