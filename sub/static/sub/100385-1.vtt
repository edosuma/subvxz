00:12.089 --> 00:14.255
(theme music playing)

00:16.923 --> 00:19.506
Let me ask you something.
You happy with your color?

00:19.589 --> 00:22.005
Fuckin' love my color.
Fuckin' mahogany.

00:22.089 --> 00:23.673
-Yeah. You're mahogany.
-Yeah.

00:23.756 --> 00:24.798
Hell, yeah.

00:24.881 --> 00:26.714
-You happy
with your color?
-No.

00:26.798 --> 00:29.255
-Huh? No?
-Ah, well, what is it?
What is it?

00:29.339 --> 00:31.214
You're like
a... a porridge,

00:31.297 --> 00:33.839
a cream of wheat,
a farina, that kind of shit.

00:33.923 --> 00:35.839
-That's what white
people's skin tone is.
-Right.

00:35.923 --> 00:38.005
-It's just different
kinds of hot cereal.
-Right, right.

00:38.089 --> 00:40.297
Black people,
your skin tone's like,

00:40.381 --> 00:42.422
it depends on
the amount of milk
you put in the coffee.

00:42.506 --> 00:44.589
Fuckin' right.
I'm like
a fuckin' Yoo-hoo.

00:44.673 --> 00:47.464
-I shake that motherfucker up.
I'm shakin' it up.
-Yoo-hoo's a good color.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.506
-Fuckin' good color. Shit.
-Yeah, Yoo-hoo's
a really good color.

00:49.589 --> 00:51.547
-Yeah.
-(laughing)

00:51.631 --> 00:52.881
-(clanks)
-What?

00:52.964 --> 00:54.381
There you go.

00:54.464 --> 00:55.714
-(clatters)
-Somewhere between--

00:55.798 --> 00:57.297
-Wait, excuse me?
-What the-- what the fuck?

00:57.381 --> 00:59.255
â™ª

01:01.839 --> 01:03.798
Hey. Larry.

01:04.297 --> 01:05.923
-Randi. Yeah.
-You got it.

01:06.005 --> 01:08.964
-I'm a friend of Susie's.
-I know, I know, I know.
Yeah.

01:09.047 --> 01:10.255
Happy New Year.

01:10.339 --> 01:11.339
Eh.

01:11.422 --> 01:12.714
It's a little late, frankly,

01:12.798 --> 01:14.214
for the "Happy New Years,"
you know?

01:14.297 --> 01:16.506
Why? It just happened
a couple of weeks ago, right?

01:16.589 --> 01:17.422
Yeah, that's too long.

01:17.506 --> 01:19.214
The statute of limitations

01:19.297 --> 01:21.089
has kind of run out
on the "New Years."

01:21.172 --> 01:23.547
-Three days. Plenty.
-Three days?

01:23.631 --> 01:25.881
By the way,
everything doesn't
have to be happy.

01:25.964 --> 01:27.547
Why does everything
have to be happy?

01:27.631 --> 01:30.339
-I'm having a pretty good day.
-Yeah. Look at you.

01:30.422 --> 01:32.422
-That's, that's huge.
-Yeah, I'm about eight months.

01:32.506 --> 01:35.673
If you need some name tips,
I'm your guy.

01:35.756 --> 01:37.464
-Yeah.
-What would you suggest?

01:37.547 --> 01:39.631
Maybe something, uh,
Swedish, perhaps?

01:39.714 --> 01:41.798
Yeah, I'm... my husband
is African-American,

01:41.881 --> 01:44.506
so I'm not sure that would,
I don't know, gel.

01:45.089 --> 01:47.005
You like saying that,
don't you.

01:47.089 --> 01:49.923
-Do I like saying that
he's African-American?
-Yeah.

01:50.005 --> 01:51.506
I think you wanted me to know.

01:51.589 --> 01:53.255
Does it change your
opinion of me?

01:53.339 --> 01:56.089
In some ways, yes.
In some ways, no.

01:56.172 --> 01:57.464
-Okay.
-All right.

01:57.547 --> 01:59.714
Enjoy your workout.

02:01.130 --> 02:02.839
(beeping)

02:04.464 --> 02:07.631
(beeping continues)

02:12.547 --> 02:14.339
What are you doing?

02:15.339 --> 02:16.464
What?

02:16.547 --> 02:18.756
What's with the--
What's with the jogging?

02:18.839 --> 02:21.172
I'm... I'm working out.

02:21.255 --> 02:23.214
-Working out?
-Yeah.

02:23.464 --> 02:25.923
You, you're jostling
the fetus.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.798
You can't--
You can't run
in your condition.

02:28.881 --> 02:30.673
Uh, yes, I can.

02:30.756 --> 02:32.005
I was advised by my midwife

02:32.089 --> 02:33.631
that I should continue
to work out.

02:33.714 --> 02:35.464
Maybe you want to
consult your blacksmith.

02:35.547 --> 02:37.005
See what he has
to say about it.

02:37.089 --> 02:40.422
Oh, I don't, uh, want
to get into it with you,
but, um...

02:40.506 --> 02:42.964
my fetus, my problem, okay?

02:43.047 --> 02:46.089
-I pity that fetus.
-(machine beeping)

02:46.172 --> 02:48.255
Larry:
Oh, my God.
I can't watch this.

02:50.047 --> 02:53.214
-Happy New Year.
-Yeah, Happy New Year.

02:57.673 --> 02:59.714
(slapping)

03:04.589 --> 03:07.547
-(slapping)
-Hey, hey, hey. Come on.
Come on, man.

03:07.839 --> 03:10.798
-You gotta stay dry.
-You're over-talcing here.

03:10.881 --> 03:12.631
-Ugh!
-Happy New Year.

03:12.714 --> 03:13.839
Yeah, yeah.

03:13.923 --> 03:15.714
-I couldn't even
breathe in there.
-Right.

03:15.798 --> 03:18.714
He was putting talc
under his arm,

03:18.798 --> 03:21.506
-on his balls...
It was disgusting.
-(laughing)

03:21.589 --> 03:24.464
-I mean, who still uses that?
-I use that shit all the time.

03:24.547 --> 03:28.172
-Can't be good for you.
-Not if you're allergic to it.

03:28.255 --> 03:29.923
My Auntie Rey
put some of that shit on her,

03:30.005 --> 03:31.506
and went into
anaphylactic shock.

03:31.589 --> 03:33.923
-Really?
-Yeah. Started shakin' and shit.
Took her to the ER.

03:34.005 --> 03:36.839
-Man, they had to pump
her stomach for nothing.
-That's incredible.

03:36.923 --> 03:38.297
Yeah, man.

03:38.381 --> 03:40.798
-Look at this guy
in the MAGA hat.
-Boy. You don't see...

03:40.881 --> 03:44.047
-You don't see many of those
in LA, do you?
-You fuckin' don't.

03:44.130 --> 03:47.214
Know what I noticed?
No one ever wears
those hats on backwards.

03:47.297 --> 03:49.631
If mean, if you're gonna
get your ass kicked,
you want to see it coming.

03:49.714 --> 03:51.130
-(chuckles)
-I like that.

03:51.214 --> 03:54.130
-Yeah.
-Mocha-- Mocha Joe's

03:54.214 --> 03:55.798
Mocha Joe.
I know a Mocha Joe.

03:55.881 --> 03:57.756
-You want some coffee?
-Sure. Okay.

03:57.839 --> 03:59.422
-Let's go in here.
-Get a little latte.

03:59.506 --> 04:01.297
-Thank you so much.
I appreciate it.
-Thank you.

04:01.381 --> 04:02.547
Have a great day.

04:02.631 --> 04:05.881
-Whoa! Blast from the past.
-Oh, boy, oh, boy.

04:05.964 --> 04:07.631
-Larry David. Wow.
-Mocha Joe!

04:07.714 --> 04:10.005
-Long time, no see, man.
What are you doin' here?
-Hey!

04:10.089 --> 04:11.297
-What's your name?
-Leon.

04:11.381 --> 04:13.214
-Leon. Nice to meet you.
-This is unreal.

04:13.297 --> 04:15.089
Do you believe it? Huh?
What can I get you guys?

04:15.172 --> 04:16.673
I'll get a--
Do you have scones?

04:16.756 --> 04:18.130
Yeah. Right there.
They're beautiful.

04:18.214 --> 04:20.047
Great. I'll have a scone,
and a, uh, cup of coffee.

04:20.130 --> 04:22.673
-Cup of coffee and a scone.
What about you, Leon?
-Let me get a latte.

04:22.756 --> 04:24.964
All right. One scone,
a coffee, a latte.

04:25.047 --> 04:26.547
That's $11.50.

04:27.005 --> 04:28.547
There you go.
Keep the change.

04:28.631 --> 04:30.172
Oh, thanks for the tip.
Appreciate it.

04:31.381 --> 04:34.130
Mocha Joe: A latte
and a coffee, please.
Thank you.

04:34.214 --> 04:35.381
Mm.

04:36.130 --> 04:37.547
It's a little soft.

04:37.881 --> 04:39.464
What, the scone?

04:39.547 --> 04:42.631
Yeah. Scones are
supposed to be hard.
This is like a muffin.

04:42.714 --> 04:46.339
Well, not really.
It's supposed to be fresh.

04:46.422 --> 04:47.881
Yeah, fresh hard.

04:47.964 --> 04:49.756
Well, that's a fresh scone.

04:49.839 --> 04:52.381
I'm not quite sure
you know what a scone is,
Mocha Joe.

04:52.464 --> 04:54.255
-Oh, I know what a scone is.
-Larry: Do you?

04:54.339 --> 04:57.214
-Yeah.
-You may have a looser
definition of scone than I do.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.255
I don't think it's really
open to interpretation,
though.

05:00.339 --> 05:03.005
You want the scone, or not?

05:03.089 --> 05:04.881
Yeah, I'll keep
the scone-slash-muffin.

05:04.964 --> 05:08.005
-So you're gonna
keep the scone?
-Yeah. Muffin. Yeah.

05:08.089 --> 05:09.464
Enjoy the scone, Larry.

05:09.547 --> 05:12.339
-Hey, you got any Danishes?
-Uh, no.

05:12.923 --> 05:14.756
You're fuckin' up.

05:14.839 --> 05:16.839
Mocha Joe:
(sighs) Next.

05:17.506 --> 05:18.964
(sighs)

05:19.047 --> 05:21.255
-Oh, my God.
-(table squeaking)

05:21.339 --> 05:24.047
-Look at this table.
Do you believe it?
-Wow.

05:24.130 --> 05:27.047
-Wow.
-Hey, uh, hey, Mocha Joe.

05:27.130 --> 05:28.464
Mocha Joe:
Yeah?

05:28.547 --> 05:31.130
-Check out this table.
-Yeah?

05:31.214 --> 05:33.464
(chuckles) It's a wobb--
You got a wobbly table, here.

05:33.547 --> 05:34.881
Yeah, well,
stop moving it.

05:34.964 --> 05:38.005
Stop moving it? It's--
Every time I, I, I lean on it,

05:38.089 --> 05:39.798
-it's gonna move.
-Put your foot on it,
like everybody else does.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.714
I'm gonna sit with
my foot on the table?

05:41.798 --> 05:43.714
Yeah, that's how
you hold it down.
The floors are wobbly.

05:43.798 --> 05:46.422
-Mocha Joe, can I give
you a little advice?
-Yeah.

05:47.130 --> 05:48.631
Nobody likes a wobbly table.

05:48.714 --> 05:51.464
Fastest way to lose customers
is wobbly tables.

05:51.547 --> 05:53.339
I got an uncle
with a wobbly leg.

05:53.422 --> 05:55.297
I can't stand that motherfucker.

05:55.381 --> 05:57.297
Leaning on shit all the time.

05:58.089 --> 06:00.172
-Hmm.
-Barista:
Two medium cappuccinos.

06:00.255 --> 06:02.673
(gulps) Aah.
(scoffs)

06:03.047 --> 06:05.297
Larry:
Taste your coffee.

06:05.756 --> 06:07.047
-Cold.
-It's cold.

06:07.130 --> 06:08.089
Hey, man.

06:08.172 --> 06:09.506
-Yeah.
-Larry: Hey, Mocha Joe.

06:09.589 --> 06:11.589
-What?
-(laughs softly)

06:12.381 --> 06:13.839
This is cold coffee.

06:13.923 --> 06:15.547
Whoa, whoa.
Wait a second.

06:15.631 --> 06:17.673
That coffee is not cold.

06:17.756 --> 06:19.339
-Is your coffee cold?
-Your coffee's hot, right?

06:19.422 --> 06:21.172
Look, we don't wanna be
fuckin' haters right now,

06:21.255 --> 06:22.464
but this shit is cold.

06:22.547 --> 06:24.172
Can, can I get a n--

06:24.255 --> 06:26.005
-Can I get a new cup?
-No.

06:26.089 --> 06:27.297
-So you're not gonna
give me a new cup.
-No.

06:27.381 --> 06:29.005
'Cause that's a hot cup
of coffee.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.881
-It was hot when
I gave it to you--
-That's a hot cup of coffee?

06:30.964 --> 06:32.714
It's a hot cup of coffee.
It was hot when
I gave it to you.

06:32.798 --> 06:34.547
Would you stick your nose
in a hot cup of coffee?

06:34.631 --> 06:35.714
Why would you
stick your nose--

06:35.798 --> 06:37.047
Because I want to prove to you

06:37.130 --> 06:39.464
that it's cold coffee.
Watch this.

06:40.464 --> 06:41.881
That's cold coffee.

06:41.964 --> 06:43.381
-That doesn't
prove anything except...
-It does.

06:43.464 --> 06:46.297
...that you're an old,
bald nut!

06:46.631 --> 06:48.172
-What'd you say to me?
-You heard me.

06:48.255 --> 06:50.464
-Now get out,
you old, bald fuck!
-With pleasure!

06:50.547 --> 06:52.798
You think I want to sit here
with a wobbly table,

06:52.881 --> 06:54.506
-and drink cold
black coffee?
-Yeah.

06:54.589 --> 06:56.422
-No, thank you.
-Yeah, good. Get out.

06:56.506 --> 06:59.506
Hey. Larry might be
one or two of those things,
but not all three.

06:59.589 --> 07:01.089
Happy New Year, Larry.

07:01.172 --> 07:03.631
Happy New Year, Mocha Joe!

07:03.714 --> 07:06.214
â™ª â™ª

07:13.214 --> 07:15.547
(collar jingling)

07:23.130 --> 07:25.923
Alice:
Morning, Larry.
How are you?

07:26.005 --> 07:28.964
-Your dog?
-Bogey!

07:29.047 --> 07:30.422
He's eating out of my bowl.

07:30.506 --> 07:32.673
Oh, I just got that bowl
from the kitchen.

07:32.756 --> 07:34.381
I thought
it was an office bowl.

07:34.464 --> 07:36.005
It's an office bowl for humans.

07:36.089 --> 07:37.255
Not for dogs.

07:37.339 --> 07:39.464
I mean, I wash it
at the end of the day

07:39.547 --> 07:41.589
-with soap,
and then I dry it, and--
-No, that's not enough.

07:41.673 --> 07:44.089
It needs to be sterilized.
I can't, I can't...

07:44.172 --> 07:46.339
share a bowl with a dog.

07:46.422 --> 07:47.798
(chuckles uncomfortably)

07:47.881 --> 07:50.756
-Uh, I've got
some mail for you.
-Ah!

07:51.255 --> 07:55.089
-And there's some other stuff.
-Wait a second. Wait a second.

07:55.714 --> 07:56.964
-Look at this.
-Yeah.

07:57.047 --> 07:58.631
-Is that new?
-Relatively.

07:58.714 --> 08:01.714
All right, what--
What the hell is that?
Why is one eye closed?

08:01.798 --> 08:03.047
Huh? What is all that?

08:03.130 --> 08:05.130
Oh, well,
it's kind of personal.
I don't--

08:05.214 --> 08:06.631
I don't share it
with everybody.

08:06.714 --> 08:08.214
Yeah, it's very personal.

08:08.297 --> 08:10.172
The whole world can see it,
but it's personal.

08:10.255 --> 08:11.923
-Well, it's on my body.
-Okay, okay.

08:12.005 --> 08:13.547
Hey, let me ask
you something, okay?

08:13.631 --> 08:15.464
If I walked in here
with a horn on my head,

08:15.547 --> 08:17.172
would you say,
"What are you doing
with a horn on your head?"

08:17.255 --> 08:19.339
I'd say,
"Oh, I can't tell you.
It's personal."

08:19.422 --> 08:22.089
I got the tattoo because
of an event in my life,

08:22.172 --> 08:23.964
and it means something
special to me.

08:24.047 --> 08:25.297
It's a reminder of that to me.

08:25.381 --> 08:27.422
-It's just for me.
-Really?

08:27.506 --> 08:30.381
Then why didn't you
put it on your ass?

08:31.756 --> 08:34.839
I have something from
the business manager
that you need to sign.

08:34.923 --> 08:36.798
Ah. All right.

08:37.756 --> 08:39.923
-Okay.
-Uh, it's just...

08:40.005 --> 08:42.214
There's an initial,
and a date,

08:42.297 --> 08:44.798
and I think three signatures.

08:45.714 --> 08:47.005
May I?

08:47.089 --> 08:49.339
Oh, what are you doing?
That's my shirt.

08:49.422 --> 08:51.297
Well, I was...
cleaning my glasses.

08:51.381 --> 08:54.089
You can't clean your glasses
with a shirt that I'm wearing

08:54.172 --> 08:55.297
while I'm wearing it.

08:55.381 --> 08:57.839
It's inappropriate.
It's crossing a boundary.

08:57.923 --> 09:00.506
-No good?
-No good.

09:00.589 --> 09:02.339
Hmm. (pops lips)
Okay.

09:02.422 --> 09:03.923
â™ª

09:06.422 --> 09:09.464
(party chatter)

09:10.714 --> 09:13.297
I know. Susie loves this house
even more than her last one.

09:13.381 --> 09:15.214
Well, the last one stunk.

09:15.297 --> 09:17.214
Cheryl:
It was too big.

09:17.297 --> 09:21.214
And he called me, uh...
He called me old and bald.

09:21.297 --> 09:22.798
-What?
-I swear to God.

09:22.881 --> 09:24.255
You know,
I'll tell you something.
I love coffee,

09:24.339 --> 09:26.381
and I love his coffee,
but you're one of my old--

09:26.464 --> 09:27.964
You are my oldest friend.

09:28.047 --> 09:29.798
I'm gonna boycott that place.

09:29.881 --> 09:31.923
-You're gonna boycott
Mocha Joe's?
-I'm boycotting.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.673
-Hey!
-Jeff: How about that?

09:33.756 --> 09:36.255
-I'm boycotting Mocha Joe.
You can't do that to my friend.
-Larry: Hey.

09:36.339 --> 09:38.089
-Look at this guy.
Look at this guy.
-That's a friend.

09:38.172 --> 09:39.506
We were in the same
hospital together.

09:39.589 --> 09:41.506
-He can't fuck with my friend.
-All right!

09:41.589 --> 09:43.589
-I'm gonna get some coffee.
-Larry: Okay.

09:43.673 --> 09:45.381
Enjoy your coffee.

09:45.464 --> 09:47.714
-He's boycotting.
-He's boycotting.
That's a big move.

09:47.798 --> 09:50.089
-Jeff: That's a big move,
a boycott.
-Oh, my God.

09:50.172 --> 09:52.756
Who invited you?
You pig.

09:52.839 --> 09:55.339
No, uh, Nancy, that is not
Harvey Weinstein.

09:55.422 --> 09:58.464
-I'm so sorry, Jeff.
My sister's from out of town.
-Jeff: Oh!

09:58.547 --> 10:00.422
-I'm just, I'm really sorry.
-Oh, my God. Oh, I'm so--

10:00.506 --> 10:03.005
-Jeff:
I'm the host of the party.
-Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

10:03.089 --> 10:04.589
Yes, I'm not Harvey Weinstein.

10:04.673 --> 10:06.589
-I'm sorry. Thank you.
I'm sorry.
-Jeff: Okay.

10:06.673 --> 10:08.756
(whispers):
He looks like Harvey Weinstein.
He looks just like him.

10:08.839 --> 10:11.255
-What the hell?
-Okay.

10:11.339 --> 10:15.547
All the time,
women, men--
doesn't matter.

10:15.631 --> 10:17.714
-Larry: Geez.
-And suddenly, I'm this guy.

10:17.798 --> 10:20.047
-Unbelievable.
-Unbelievable.

10:20.130 --> 10:23.589
I'm starving.
Oh! Pigs in a blanket.

10:23.673 --> 10:25.255
-What's better?
-Oh...

10:25.339 --> 10:28.506
I've been following
her around all night,
but she never has any.

10:28.589 --> 10:29.923
Jeff:
They go fast.

10:30.005 --> 10:32.464
I don't care how foo-foo
the other items are,

10:32.547 --> 10:34.798
-and people love 'em,
pigs in a blanket.
-Yeah.

10:34.881 --> 10:38.381
Larry, I am
extremely displeased
with your behavior.

10:38.464 --> 10:40.130
Ladies and gentlemen,

10:40.214 --> 10:43.464
the 16th president
of these United States...

10:43.547 --> 10:45.464
-Yeah, yeah. You're funny.
-...Abraham Lincoln.

10:45.547 --> 10:47.130
Let's give him
a big round of applause.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.547
-Like you know anything
about fashion.
-It is such an honor

10:49.631 --> 10:52.089
to be standing near you,
Mr. President.

10:52.172 --> 10:55.464
This hat is very similar
to the one that
Kate Middleton wore.

10:55.547 --> 10:57.714
-Okay? You don't know shit.
-Oh, really?

10:57.798 --> 10:59.881
-I know you look ridiculous.
How about that?
-Yeah. Yeah, fine.

10:59.964 --> 11:03.756
You act ridiculous.
Why are you harassing
my friend Randi at the gym?

11:03.839 --> 11:06.589
Hey, you know what?
Somebody has to stand up
for that fetus.

11:06.673 --> 11:08.005
You don't know anything
about fetuses.

11:08.089 --> 11:09.756
I know you don't go
on a treadmill

11:09.839 --> 11:11.464
eight months pregnant.
You don't have to be a genius

11:11.547 --> 11:13.214
-to figure that out.
-Why not? Why not?

11:13.297 --> 11:15.047
Do you think
that's good for fetus?
All that jostling?

11:15.130 --> 11:18.506
It's not your job
to mansplain to Randi!

11:18.589 --> 11:20.297
-Jeff, there's people
I want you to meet.
-Okay.

11:20.381 --> 11:23.005
"Four score and seven years ago,

11:23.089 --> 11:26.381
"our fathers brought forth
to this continent

11:26.464 --> 11:27.881
"a new nation,

11:27.964 --> 11:29.756
"conceived in liberty,

11:29.839 --> 11:31.756
-dedicated..."
-Larry, Happy New Year.

11:31.839 --> 11:33.255
You're too late.

11:33.339 --> 11:35.089
"Happy New Year."
Come on. It's three weeks.

11:35.172 --> 11:37.464
-Isn't it almost
a month already?
-It's ridiculous.

11:37.547 --> 11:39.714
Ah, look, well, they have
nothing to say, these people.

11:40.339 --> 11:43.255
-Oh, man.
-How do you know it's
a happy new year, anyway?

11:43.547 --> 11:45.923
-I can't believe it.
-What?

11:46.714 --> 11:49.339
Aw, I missed 'em again.
It's unbelievable.

11:49.422 --> 11:51.381
Hey, Larry!
Hey!

11:51.464 --> 11:52.589
-Hey.
-How you been?

11:52.673 --> 11:54.172
-Good.
-Yeah, great to see you.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.673
Shit. That's Rosen--

11:55.756 --> 11:56.923
-Phil Rosenthal.
-Phil Rosenthal.

11:57.005 --> 11:58.881
He just talks about
his shows all the time.

11:58.964 --> 12:02.422
His own show, and how about--
Romano is on 500 times a day.

12:02.506 --> 12:03.881
Somebody Feed Phil.

12:03.964 --> 12:06.214
Oh, geez, with all the chaos
in the world,

12:06.297 --> 12:07.923
in third-world countries,
feed him?

12:08.005 --> 12:09.214
He should be feeding
other people.

12:09.297 --> 12:11.047
It should be called
Phil Feeds Everybody.

12:11.130 --> 12:13.547
-You know what I'm gonna
do with him tonight?
-What's that?

12:13.631 --> 12:15.506
The Big Goodbye.

12:15.589 --> 12:17.214
I'm employing
The Big Goodbye.

12:17.297 --> 12:19.547
-It's the greatest
move in history.
-How great is The Big Goodbye?

12:19.631 --> 12:21.464
I've been doing it for years,
since you taught me.

12:21.547 --> 12:23.047
-You avoid the person
all night...
-Of course.

12:23.130 --> 12:25.089
And then at the end,
when you're about to leave,

12:25.172 --> 12:27.047
you go, "Ah!"
You give 'em
a big goodbye.

12:27.130 --> 12:30.673
-Then they feel good...
-Bye! Goodbye and good luck
to you and your family.

12:30.756 --> 12:33.214
They're very happy that
you spent this time with them

12:33.297 --> 12:34.714
at the end of the night, and...

12:34.798 --> 12:36.714
-and you slip out.
-It's genius.

12:36.798 --> 12:39.798
Um, are you up for doing
our old ventriloquist act?

12:39.881 --> 12:41.923
-I don't know.
Susie wants to see it.
-Yeah, I'll do it.

12:42.005 --> 12:43.047
-You will?
-Yeah.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.381
Okay, good.
Can we do it pretty soon?

12:44.464 --> 12:45.839
Because I want Ted to see it
before he leaves.

12:45.923 --> 12:47.714
-Of course.
-Thank you.

12:48.506 --> 12:50.005
Ted.

12:50.089 --> 12:51.839
-(all laughing)
-I'd like to thank
Jeff and Susie

12:51.923 --> 12:54.923
-for inviting us into
their beautiful home.
-I like the other one.

12:55.005 --> 12:56.798
(crowd laughing)

12:56.881 --> 12:58.881
Well, I think the house
is very nice.

12:58.964 --> 13:01.464
-(laughs)
-(crowd laughing)

13:01.547 --> 13:04.714
Did they throw that
fish smell in for free?

13:04.798 --> 13:07.881
(laughing)

13:07.964 --> 13:11.631
And, and, and look at all
our other friends who are
kind enough to join us.

13:11.714 --> 13:15.631
-There's, there's Ted Danson.
-Wow, is he handsome!

13:15.714 --> 13:17.255
He sure thinks so.

13:17.339 --> 13:20.005
-Oh!
-(laughing)

13:20.714 --> 13:22.964
And how about Susie,
our inimitable hostess?

13:23.047 --> 13:25.798
-(clapping)
-Susie, I love the curtains,

13:25.881 --> 13:27.881
but why did you make
a jacket out of it?

13:27.964 --> 13:30.964
-Crowd: Oh!
-(raucous laughter)

13:31.047 --> 13:33.798
-Are you having a good time?
-A good time?
Are you kidding me?

13:33.881 --> 13:37.464
I'm with a bunch of stiffs,
the food sucks, the drinks
aren't strong enough,

13:37.547 --> 13:38.631
and your hand is up my ass.

13:38.714 --> 13:40.881
(laughing)

13:41.339 --> 13:44.464
(laughing):
Hey. Don't look so down.

13:44.547 --> 13:46.589
(laughing)

13:47.255 --> 13:48.923
Are you mad?

13:49.005 --> 13:51.506
-Let's kiss and make up.
-I'm...

13:51.589 --> 13:55.756
-I'm not gonna kiss a dummy.
-I wouldn't. She's got a cold.

13:56.714 --> 13:59.089
Aw. That's the end!

13:59.172 --> 14:01.005
-(applause, laughter)
-Jeff: Bravo!

14:01.089 --> 14:03.464
Bravo! Cheryl and Larry.

14:03.547 --> 14:06.464
-Cheryl and Larry.
-(cheers, whistles)

14:06.547 --> 14:08.756
What a great audience.
Thank you. Thank you.

14:08.839 --> 14:12.214
-Fantastic.
Thank you all for coming.
-Susie: I love that bit.

14:12.297 --> 14:14.547
-Thanks for coming.
-Susie: Always loved that bit.

14:14.631 --> 14:17.339
-You were very funny.
-Thank you.

14:17.422 --> 14:19.923
-I'm sorry, but I gotta
catch my plane.
-Okay.

14:20.005 --> 14:22.506
Actually, you know what,
I better not.
I don't wanna catch a cold.

14:22.589 --> 14:24.339
-Cheryl: Oh, I know.
You gotta stay...
-I'm sorry. Yeah.

14:24.422 --> 14:26.422
-I'll call you when I land.
-...healthy. Okay.

14:26.506 --> 14:27.923
You don't need to call her
when you land.

14:28.005 --> 14:30.089
If there's a plane crash,
we'll know about it.

14:30.172 --> 14:32.214
-Okay. I'll walk you, Ted.
-Thank you, guys.

14:32.297 --> 14:34.547
-Susie: Thank you for coming.
-Ted: That was a great evening.

14:34.631 --> 14:36.756
â™ª

14:44.339 --> 14:46.547
Ah! There you are.
Finally gotcha.

14:46.631 --> 14:48.464
Sir, I need you
to get out of here.

14:48.547 --> 14:50.214
Get out of here?
What are you talking about?

14:50.297 --> 14:53.047
I need you to leave this room
'cause you've been ogling me...

14:53.130 --> 14:55.172
-the entire night.
-Ogling you? Are you nuts?

14:55.255 --> 14:57.839
-I, I, I've been ogling
the pigs in a blanket.
-Am I--

14:57.923 --> 14:59.381
Oh, my God. Yeah.

14:59.464 --> 15:02.297
-Not the first time
this has happened.
-What? I want one.

15:13.172 --> 15:14.297
Wow.

15:15.464 --> 15:17.881
-Ah. Hey.
-Hey. Excuse me.

15:17.964 --> 15:19.881
-Huh? Were we a hit?
-We were a hit.

15:19.964 --> 15:22.839
-We were the highlight
of this party.
-Highlight of the party.

15:22.923 --> 15:25.839
Yeah, I mean,
it's a been a while,
but we've still got it.

15:25.923 --> 15:28.255
-What are--
What are you doing?
-I'm gonna go home.

15:28.339 --> 15:30.255
-I'm just getting an Uber.
-Uber?

15:30.339 --> 15:32.798
-I'll take you home.
-You don't have to do that.

15:32.881 --> 15:34.255
Ah, it's nothing.

15:34.339 --> 15:37.172
-Okay. Okay.
Thank you. That's--
-Um, just give me...

15:37.255 --> 15:38.631
Give me two minutes.

15:38.714 --> 15:40.964
Okay. All right. Thanks.

15:41.714 --> 15:43.297
Are you kidding?

15:43.381 --> 15:46.339
I can't believe
I didn't get a chance
to talk to you all night,

15:46.422 --> 15:47.964
and now I'm on my way out.

15:48.047 --> 15:50.673
-What a shame.
-You giving me
The Big Goodbye?

15:50.756 --> 15:52.964
-The Big Goodbye? What are you--
What are you talking about?
-Big Goodbye.

15:53.047 --> 15:55.506
Where you avoid me all night,
and then you think you can

15:55.589 --> 15:57.839
cure it by having a Big Goodbye.
I know. I've been around.

15:57.923 --> 16:00.714
-I wasn't giving you a Big-- I
never heard of the Big Goodbye.
-It seems like a Big Goodbye.

16:00.798 --> 16:02.798
No, it wasn't.
It was just a normal goodbye.

16:02.881 --> 16:04.464
-That's a normal goodbye.
-Yeah?

16:04.547 --> 16:05.714
-Yeah.
-Really?

16:05.798 --> 16:06.964
Yeah. I wasn't trying
to avoid you.

16:07.047 --> 16:08.547
Are you kidding?
Why would I avoid you?

16:08.631 --> 16:10.172
Have lunch with me
Wednesday?

16:10.589 --> 16:12.297
We have a lot to talk about.
Listen,

16:12.381 --> 16:14.339
we're doing Raymond
in Portugal.

16:14.422 --> 16:16.839
Yeah.
Everybody Loves Joam.

16:16.923 --> 16:18.964
It's fantastic.
I get to go.

16:19.047 --> 16:20.839
And then I have the whole
Somebody Feed Phil  show.

16:20.923 --> 16:23.673
I want you to do my show.
I want to go to Ethiopia
with you.

16:23.756 --> 16:25.798
-(chuckles) Ethiopia.
-Ethiopia's great.

16:25.881 --> 16:27.464
I don't think I'm
running off to Ethiopia--

16:27.547 --> 16:28.964
Sure, you eat with your hands.
It's fantastic.

16:29.047 --> 16:30.464
-Everybody shares,
and, and the thing--
-I... I...

16:30.547 --> 16:32.255
-I don't like to leave
the continent, you know.
-No?

16:32.339 --> 16:33.631
-Nah.
-All right.
You know what?

16:33.714 --> 16:35.464
We'll start lunch Wednesday.
We'll see where it goes.

16:35.547 --> 16:37.923
Say yes to me
and you can go.

16:38.506 --> 16:40.381
-Okay.
-Okay.

16:40.464 --> 16:41.881
Larry: You know,
did I ever tell you

16:41.964 --> 16:44.381
that I once did a, uh,
premature Big Goodbye?

16:44.464 --> 16:46.631
So what does that mean?
You said goodbye and then
you didn't leave?

16:46.714 --> 16:48.923
-I did a Big Goodbye
and then I didn't--
-Come on.

16:49.005 --> 16:51.839
-And I didn't leave.
-And what did they do?
They were mad?

16:51.923 --> 16:54.673
-I ran into her in the kitchen
about an hour later.
-Come on.

16:54.756 --> 16:57.464
And what do you say?
What do you even say?

16:57.547 --> 16:59.673
She said,
"I thought you left."
I said, "Well, you know.

16:59.756 --> 17:02.631
I got, uh...
something happened."
I don't know.

17:02.714 --> 17:04.297
I made up a story.

17:04.381 --> 17:06.964
I, but I,
I can't believe that...

17:07.047 --> 17:08.506
that he knew about
the Big Goodbye.

17:08.589 --> 17:10.255
-(laughing)
-That was unbelievable to me.

17:10.339 --> 17:13.130
Well, I can't believe
that you kissed me when
you knew I had a cold.

17:13.214 --> 17:14.839
That was pretty unbelievable.

17:14.923 --> 17:17.089
Yeah. You...

17:18.297 --> 17:20.255
I would do it again.

17:29.839 --> 17:31.339
(sighs)

17:40.255 --> 17:42.089
Cheryl:
Wow, Larry.

17:42.506 --> 17:44.130
What are we doing?

17:44.714 --> 17:47.047
By the way,
before we get into that,

17:47.130 --> 17:49.214
are you aware that you have
a wobbly table here?

17:49.297 --> 17:52.547
Look at this.
Look at this table.
It's unbelievable.

17:52.631 --> 17:55.798
-I, I don't know how you
can go to bed at night.
-Yeah, it doesn't bother me.

17:55.881 --> 17:57.756
If all tables in
your house wobbled,

17:57.839 --> 17:59.964
you could live like that?
You could in a wobble-house?

18:00.047 --> 18:04.130
We need to talk about Ted.
We need to talk about everything
that just happened here.

18:04.214 --> 18:06.047
-What?
-What?

18:06.130 --> 18:08.172
-What are you so...
-Oh...

18:08.255 --> 18:09.756
I'm, I'm your ex-husband.

18:09.839 --> 18:12.047
Ted is such a good person.

18:12.130 --> 18:14.506
No, he's not such
a good person, okay?

18:14.589 --> 18:17.214
You don't do that.
You don't date
a friend's ex-wife.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.089
I mean, it's crazy.

18:19.673 --> 18:22.130
-You know what it is?
-Now... what?

18:22.214 --> 18:25.923
I think when I'm with you,
it makes me feel...

18:26.506 --> 18:28.923
-...better about myself?
-Morally superior.

18:29.005 --> 18:30.339
-Yes.
-Yes.

18:30.422 --> 18:32.089
-I hear that a lot. Yeah.
-Yeah. So, I'm not perfect,

18:32.172 --> 18:34.756
-but at least
I'm better than you.
-You're better than me.

18:34.839 --> 18:36.172
I can relate to
what you're saying,

18:36.255 --> 18:38.339
'cause I don't, I don't
feel that way with people.

18:38.422 --> 18:41.673
-I feel morally
inferior to people.
-Yeah.

18:41.756 --> 18:44.923
But I feel that way
with animals 'cause
they're generally so stupid,

18:45.005 --> 18:47.839
and I can--
especially insects,
I can crush them.

18:47.923 --> 18:50.089
You know, and, and
they eat each other.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.673
I mean, they're crazy,
animals. So, yeah.

18:52.756 --> 18:55.130
I feel smarter
and morally superior to them.

18:55.214 --> 18:56.798
(both laugh)

18:56.881 --> 19:00.381
-Hey. Uh... Let me
ask you something.
-Yeah?

19:01.255 --> 19:03.547
Is there any chance that...

19:04.422 --> 19:07.089
we might meet up again?

19:07.756 --> 19:09.589
We'll see.

19:09.673 --> 19:10.923
We'll see.

19:11.172 --> 19:14.214
-You can't stay here.
-I'm gonna tell you something,
okay?

19:14.297 --> 19:16.297
-If we ever got
back together...
-Yeah.

19:16.381 --> 19:19.798
...and somehow this table
appeared on, on our bedside...

19:19.881 --> 19:22.798
-Yeah?
-...it would be fixed
immediately.

19:22.881 --> 19:24.756
-Immediately.
-Oh, my God.

19:24.839 --> 19:27.673
-Larry: I could not live
with a wobbly table.
-Cheryl: Larry, please.

19:27.756 --> 19:29.214
-Go.
-Larry: Okay.

19:33.464 --> 19:35.047
Ha-ha!

19:35.130 --> 19:36.673
-What?
-Where the fuck you been at?

19:36.756 --> 19:38.506
-What are you? My mother?
-Fuck yeah, I am.

19:38.589 --> 19:40.673
All right,
I was at a party, okay?
I was at Jeff's party.

19:40.756 --> 19:42.506
-That party was over
a long time ago.
-Huh?

19:42.589 --> 19:45.673
Yeah. This right here--
This right here?
It's called tappin' hours.

19:45.756 --> 19:47.714
This is the hours when
people are tappin' ass.

19:47.798 --> 19:49.589
I'm not tappin'.
I'm not tappin'.

19:49.673 --> 19:51.464
Older white men should not
be out this fuckin' late.

19:51.547 --> 19:54.589
There's no late-night
yacht club,
or late-night garage sales

19:54.673 --> 19:56.422
and shit like that.
You out here fuckin'.

19:56.506 --> 19:58.005
When I'm tappin',
I always tell you.

19:58.089 --> 19:59.714
I come home and spread
the fuckin' news.

19:59.798 --> 20:01.381
You wanna know who I'm tappin'?
You wanna know who I'm tappin'?

20:01.464 --> 20:03.547
-Who the fuck you tappin'?
-(slams)

20:03.631 --> 20:06.255
Larry: I can't get out of it.
It's Phil Rosenthal.
He's just--

20:06.339 --> 20:08.005
What do you do?
How many times
can you say no?

20:08.089 --> 20:10.005
You couldn't do
the Big Goodbye?

20:10.089 --> 20:12.214
I did the Big Goodbye.
He saw right through it.

20:12.297 --> 20:13.756
Ah! You know what I'll do?

20:13.839 --> 20:15.339
I'll call you
in the middle of lunch.

20:15.422 --> 20:17.464
Say it's an emergency
and you gotta go.

20:17.547 --> 20:19.381
I did that the last time
I had lunch with him.

20:19.464 --> 20:21.464
Oh, boy.
That guy's relentless.

20:21.547 --> 20:24.589
Hey, Lar, that was
some party last night, huh?

20:25.130 --> 20:27.089
-Yeah, it was a great party.
-You had a good time?

20:27.172 --> 20:28.756
-I did. I had a nice time.
-Yeah.

20:28.839 --> 20:31.297
So you drove Cheryl home?

20:32.172 --> 20:33.255
Yep.

20:33.339 --> 20:34.756
That was very nice of you.

20:34.839 --> 20:37.005
-Considering Ted's
out of town--
-Yeah. I'm a nice guy.

20:37.089 --> 20:38.547
-Yeah.
-Yeah. I'm a nice guy.

20:38.631 --> 20:40.631
So, what, did you just
drop her off, or--

20:40.714 --> 20:42.881
-Yeah. Pretty much.
-Hmm.

20:42.964 --> 20:46.714
Dropped her off.
Said good night.
Went on my merry way.

20:46.798 --> 20:48.339
Mm-hmm.

20:49.881 --> 20:52.964
-Is there something
you would like to know, or--
-No, no, no.

20:53.047 --> 20:54.964
Something you're
not saying? Um...

20:55.047 --> 20:56.798
You know, can I person
not just ask

20:56.881 --> 20:59.589
-a, a normal question?
-No, they're not
normal questions.

20:59.673 --> 21:02.381
-There's a lot of implications.
A lot of implications.
-Larry: You're fishing--

21:02.464 --> 21:04.130
You're on a little
fishing expedition.

21:04.214 --> 21:05.756
You know,
you two are something.

21:05.839 --> 21:07.089
-You two make crap up--
-We're something?

21:07.172 --> 21:08.589
You know what?
You're something.

21:08.673 --> 21:10.589
Don't eat all the leftovers.
We need them for dinner.

21:10.673 --> 21:12.839
-Jeff: Sure, I won't.
-You're something.

21:13.673 --> 21:16.255
-I'll eat whatever
the fuck I want.
-That's right.

21:16.339 --> 21:17.923
Hey. Did you sleep with Cheryl?

21:18.005 --> 21:19.547
-Yeah.
-You did?

21:19.631 --> 21:22.255
-Yeah. Listen.
(chuckles)
-Ah.

21:22.339 --> 21:24.756
You cannot say anything
to Susie. Cannot.

21:24.839 --> 21:26.756
Under any circumstances.
Cheryl swore me to secrecy.

21:26.839 --> 21:28.005
She didn't want me to tell you.

21:28.089 --> 21:29.923
But I had to.
I couldn't--
How could I not?

21:30.005 --> 21:31.923
I'm a human being,
for God's sake.

21:32.005 --> 21:33.464
-I think it's great.
-Right?

21:33.547 --> 21:35.923
Yes. Wha--
What are you hoping
to get out of it, though?

21:36.005 --> 21:38.547
I'm hoping to get
back together, but...

21:38.631 --> 21:41.506
-I'll be surprised
if I see her again.
-Hmm.

21:41.589 --> 21:43.673
We on for golf on Saturday?

21:43.756 --> 21:45.297
Yeah. Um...

21:45.381 --> 21:47.130
Arnie Norton asked
if he could play.

21:47.214 --> 21:50.255
(scoffs)
I'm not playing with him.
He's a Trump supporter.

21:50.339 --> 21:52.589
-Never play with
a Trump supporter.
-Really?

21:52.673 --> 21:54.381
See him around town
with that hat.

21:54.464 --> 21:56.047
"Make America Great Again."

21:56.130 --> 21:58.089
I don't need that crap.

21:59.214 --> 22:02.089
He just--
He makes me want to
not be anywhere near him.

22:02.964 --> 22:06.464
I don't know.
You can check with Carl.
See if he wants to play.

22:06.547 --> 22:07.756
I gotta go.

22:09.130 --> 22:11.964
(Phil whistling)

22:12.506 --> 22:13.964
-Phil: Oh, hello, there.
-Hostess: Hi.

22:14.047 --> 22:16.381
Hi. I'm Phil Rosenthal.
I have a twelve o'clock.

22:16.464 --> 22:18.339
Oh, yes.
Mr. David's already here.

22:18.422 --> 22:20.756
-He is? Wow.
-Yes. Right this way.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.381
-Very impressive.
-He was early.

22:26.923 --> 22:28.255
Enjoy.

22:28.339 --> 22:30.631
Larry:
Hey, Phil!

22:31.547 --> 22:34.756
Good to see you.
Sit. Sit down. Sit down.

22:35.964 --> 22:38.798
Boy, I'm so glad we did this.
It was such a good idea.

22:38.881 --> 22:40.172
You, you were definitely right.

22:40.255 --> 22:42.005
I'm, I'm starving.
I hope this place is good.

22:42.089 --> 22:43.839
Yeah, yeah, it's great.
It's big portions

22:43.923 --> 22:46.005
on the food and everything.
It's really...

22:46.089 --> 22:48.089
a fantastic place. Um...

22:48.172 --> 22:50.381
You know what else?
I've been thinking...

22:50.464 --> 22:52.964
Really thinking about
this Ethiopia thing.

22:53.047 --> 22:55.214
Yeah, actually,
I heard that
we have some budget cuts,

22:55.297 --> 22:59.005
and Ethiopia's a little...
ex-expensive to shoot in.

22:59.089 --> 23:00.714
Wasn't that one of
the shithole countries?

23:00.798 --> 23:02.964
I can't remember if
that was on the list or not.

23:03.047 --> 23:05.839
-Oh, look. I'm getting a thing.
-Larry: Oh!

23:06.214 --> 23:08.673
Oh, yeah.
Oh, look at that.
Um, uh...

23:08.756 --> 23:11.214
My son's flight, uh,
got in early.

23:11.297 --> 23:13.714
-And I gotta get him.
I gotta go get him.
-Oh! Really?

23:13.798 --> 23:17.005
-Yeah, no, really.
-Let's... Send, send
an Uber or something.

23:17.089 --> 23:19.631
He needs to see me
because he has a little anxiety.

23:19.714 --> 23:21.381
No, no! You know what?
Phil...

23:21.464 --> 23:24.255
No, no.
We'll, we'll, we'll...
We'll... something.

23:27.130 --> 23:28.673
Ah!

23:28.756 --> 23:30.589
Fill her up.

23:31.464 --> 23:33.381
-Ah! Arigato!
-Yes.

23:33.464 --> 23:36.923
-Arigato!
-All right. Two seats
at the sushi bar.

23:44.130 --> 23:46.964
You know what?
Actually, I think we'd prefer
to sit at a table, please.

23:47.047 --> 23:48.714
Larry:
Huh.

23:50.339 --> 23:51.839
Sad.

23:51.923 --> 23:53.964
Very sad. Sad.

23:54.047 --> 23:56.089
(motorcycle rumbling)

23:56.172 --> 23:58.214
(singing indistinctly)

23:58.297 --> 24:01.130
-Biker: Hey! What
the fuck are you doing?
-Whoa.

24:01.214 --> 24:03.756
-Oh, God. Oh, God.
-Motherfucker!
What the fuck?

24:03.839 --> 24:05.506
What are you
trying to do, man?

24:05.589 --> 24:08.714
-What the fuck are you doing?
You little fucker!
-Oh, God. Oh, God.

24:08.798 --> 24:11.089
-I'm sorry, I didn't see you.
-What the fuck?

24:11.172 --> 24:13.714
-I'm sorry, I didn't see you!
-I'm ought to rip you
outta that fuckin' car!

24:13.798 --> 24:16.756
-You little shit.
-I'm sorry.
I didn't see you.

24:16.839 --> 24:19.214
Oh. Just be more careful
next time, okay?

24:19.297 --> 24:22.422
Will do. Will do.
Okay. Thank you.

24:22.506 --> 24:24.464
â™ª

24:26.798 --> 24:28.798
Richard:
â™ª Now, now... â™ª

24:28.881 --> 24:32.297
â™ª I want my coffee
and my Danish
right now, now, now â™ª

24:32.381 --> 24:35.589
(continues singing indistinctly)

24:50.255 --> 24:52.130
-(knocking)
-What are you--
What are you doing here?

24:52.214 --> 24:54.047
What do you mean
what am I doin' here?

24:54.130 --> 24:56.172
-Come here. Come out.
I want to talk to you.
-You come here.

24:56.255 --> 24:58.339
-No, come on.
Come on out here.
-No, you come.

24:58.422 --> 25:00.547
-Come on. I want
to talk to you. Come on.
-I'm not leaving. You come.

25:00.631 --> 25:03.422
-You come. You come.
-(mutters): Aw, fuck it.

25:04.714 --> 25:07.255
What are you doing here?
You said you were gonna
boycott this place.

25:07.339 --> 25:08.964
I am boycotting this place.

25:09.047 --> 25:11.005
Oh, this is a boycott?
Sitting here drinking coffee?

25:11.089 --> 25:12.589
That's a boy--
That's quite a boycott.

25:12.673 --> 25:15.714
I told you,
for the rest of
my dying days,

25:15.798 --> 25:18.255
I will never come
to this place with you.

25:18.339 --> 25:20.047
-Ever.
-That's not what you said.

25:20.130 --> 25:22.339
-I said I was--
-You said you're
boycotting this place.

25:22.422 --> 25:24.464
And you're
never coming back here.
You didn't say with me.

25:24.547 --> 25:26.756
What are you?
My Jewish puppet master?

25:26.839 --> 25:28.756
I can do whatever
the fuck I want alone,

25:28.839 --> 25:30.839
-but with you,
I will never come in here.
-Look!

25:30.923 --> 25:32.172
I swear on my life.

25:32.255 --> 25:33.798
Who the fuck needs you
for a boycott

25:33.881 --> 25:36.130
if I'm boycotting already?
I don't need you

25:36.214 --> 25:37.714
to boycott.
You said you're boycotting,

25:37.798 --> 25:39.005
-but you didn't boycott.
-Are you done?

25:39.089 --> 25:40.714
I-- I don't understand.
I si-- (scoffs)

25:40.798 --> 25:42.798
-I don't understand you.
-(woman coughing)

25:43.506 --> 25:45.631
Oh, my God.
Now she's drinking coffee!

25:45.714 --> 25:47.506
-Richard: Who's that?
-Larry: It's unbelievable.

25:47.589 --> 25:49.714
-Richard: Who?
-Susie's friend. I saw her
in the gym the other day.

25:49.798 --> 25:52.130
She's eight months pregnant.
She was running on a treadmill.

25:52.839 --> 25:54.881
She has no regard
for this fetus.

25:54.964 --> 25:56.547
Now she's drinking coffee.

25:56.631 --> 26:00.089
This coffee, by the way,
is unbelievable.
It's fantastic.

26:00.172 --> 26:02.047
-Is it hot?
-It's very hot.

26:02.130 --> 26:05.214
-Let me see that for a second.
-Hey, don't touch my--
I don't like-- Don't touch it.

26:05.297 --> 26:07.255
What the-- Hey, stop it!

26:07.964 --> 26:09.756
What are you,
a fuckin' goose?

26:09.839 --> 26:12.130
Okay. That's not
hot coffee, okay?

26:12.214 --> 26:14.339
If that was hot coffee,
I, I would have burned my nose.

26:14.422 --> 26:17.255
Who asked for a nose test?
I didn't want a nose test!

26:17.339 --> 26:19.005
-What, are you
outta your mind?
-Not hot.

26:19.089 --> 26:20.506
What the hell
is going on here?

26:20.589 --> 26:22.589
-Is he bothering you,
Mr. Lewis?
-Yes, he's bothering me.

26:22.673 --> 26:24.923
-Oh, really?
-Richard: Yeah, really.

26:25.005 --> 26:27.214
You know what, Larry?
Get out.

26:27.297 --> 26:29.214
-Huh.
-This is what it's come to.

26:29.297 --> 26:32.547
You're banned. For life.
I never wanna see you
in here again.

26:32.631 --> 26:36.172
-Is that so?
-Yeah. You're banned.
Banned! Get out!

26:36.255 --> 26:38.381
With pleasure.

26:40.005 --> 26:41.422
â™ª

26:41.506 --> 26:43.506
Mark my words, Mocha Joe,

26:44.255 --> 26:45.881
and mark them well.

26:45.964 --> 26:49.047
I don't know how,
and I don't know when,

26:49.130 --> 26:51.339
but I will exact vengeance.

26:51.422 --> 26:53.005
As God is my witness,

26:53.089 --> 26:56.881
I will bring you to the brink
of extinction,

26:56.964 --> 26:59.130
or I will die trying.

26:59.798 --> 27:02.506
-Happy New Year, Mocha Joe!
-Happy New Year, Larry.

27:02.589 --> 27:03.756
Hey, Happy New Year, man.

27:03.839 --> 27:05.631
Happy New Year.

27:05.714 --> 27:07.506
â™ª â™ª

27:16.714 --> 27:19.381
(phone ringing)

27:20.172 --> 27:21.714
Hello, Larry David's office.

27:21.798 --> 27:23.381
Valerie (over phone):
Hi, my name is Valerie Ashburn.

27:23.464 --> 27:24.798
I'd like to speak
to Larry David.

27:24.881 --> 27:26.589
Yes, may I ask
what this is regarding?

27:26.673 --> 27:30.714
Sure. This is regarding him
sexually assaulting me
at a party.

27:31.089 --> 27:33.798
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.
What--

27:33.881 --> 27:35.464
What happened?

27:35.547 --> 27:36.798
I was catering at a party.

27:36.881 --> 27:39.464
Larry was molesting me
with his eyes

27:39.547 --> 27:42.339
the entire night.
And then when I went
into a pantry,

27:42.422 --> 27:44.631
he followed me in,
cornered me,

27:44.714 --> 27:46.756
and he grabbed my breast.
I was lucky to get out of there.

27:46.839 --> 27:50.255
-You know he did something
like that to me, too?
-Valerie: No.

27:50.339 --> 27:52.506
-Oh, my God.
-Alice: Yeah.

27:52.589 --> 27:54.422
Everything was fine.
And one day he...

27:54.506 --> 27:56.255
asked about a tattoo
I have on my arm,

27:56.339 --> 27:57.464
and I wouldn't tell him
what it meant,

27:57.547 --> 27:58.756
and then he got
obsessive about it.

27:58.839 --> 28:00.339
And why did I have it
on my arm,

28:00.422 --> 28:02.881
and why didn't I
have it on my butt,
somewhere private.

28:02.964 --> 28:04.547
Okay. So this is a pattern.

28:04.631 --> 28:06.923
Alice:
Oh, yeah. And that's
just the beginning.

28:20.839 --> 28:22.547
What the fuck!

28:23.673 --> 28:24.923
Fuck!

28:25.005 --> 28:26.923
(gags)

28:28.506 --> 28:30.089
(groans)

28:32.339 --> 28:33.798
Shit.

28:34.589 --> 28:37.339
Damn it. Frickin' dog.

28:38.130 --> 28:41.047
And he grabbed my shirt
to wipe his glasses.

28:41.130 --> 28:43.464
Hold on.
I have to shut the door.

28:48.339 --> 28:50.923
-Larry?
-Larry: I'll be out
in a second.

28:51.005 --> 28:52.631
Okay.

28:58.381 --> 28:59.881
-What's with the robe?
-Larry: Oh.

28:59.964 --> 29:02.756
'Cause I spit cereal up
all over my shirt,

29:02.839 --> 29:04.547
because there was
dog hair in it.

29:04.631 --> 29:06.464
-(groans) Disgusting.
-Larry: Right?

29:06.547 --> 29:09.756
So... what's going on?
What do you...

29:09.839 --> 29:12.464
What, what are you doing here?
You haven't been here in a year.

29:12.547 --> 29:14.381
What the fuck is
going on with you?

29:14.464 --> 29:16.422
-What are you talking about?
-You're wearing a MAGA hat

29:16.506 --> 29:17.881
at a sushi restaurant?

29:18.005 --> 29:20.673
-Is that true?
-Well, I did have
the hat on, yeah.

29:20.756 --> 29:22.923
-What, are you pro-Trump?
-No, no.

29:23.005 --> 29:24.631
Look, I got this idea
to wear that hat

29:24.714 --> 29:27.089
-so I wouldn't have to have
lunch with Phil Rosenthal.
-Mm.

29:27.172 --> 29:30.089
And it worked like a charm.
He saw me in the hat
and he left the restaurant.

29:30.172 --> 29:31.756
-It was amazing.
-I'm not surprised.

29:31.839 --> 29:33.881
You know what?
It's really comin' in handy.

29:33.964 --> 29:36.255
Yeah, 'cause no one's gonna
wanna be anywhere near you.

29:36.339 --> 29:38.964
Exactly!
It's, it's a great
people repellent.

29:39.839 --> 29:41.923
-(groans)
-You know, look.
When you're a celebrity,

29:42.005 --> 29:44.589
you can do anything you want.
You can grab 'em by the pussy--

29:44.673 --> 29:46.589
-What did you say?
-What?

29:46.673 --> 29:48.130
Why are you wearing
a bathrobe?

29:48.214 --> 29:51.798
-And that hat!
-Oh, no, no! No, I--
(stammering)

29:51.881 --> 29:54.547
Oh, my God!
You're friends
with that monster?

29:54.631 --> 29:55.798
-No, I'm--
-Alice: No!

29:55.881 --> 29:57.756
-No, no, no, no, no!
-No! No, no, I'm just--

29:57.839 --> 29:58.923
Alice:
I'm getting a lawyer!

29:59.005 --> 30:00.631
No! What? Hey! What?

30:00.714 --> 30:02.130
No! I'm in the bathrobe

30:02.214 --> 30:03.631
'cause your fuckin' dog
got hair

30:03.714 --> 30:04.839
all over my cereal bowl,

30:04.923 --> 30:06.506
and that's not Weinstein!

30:06.589 --> 30:09.214
â™ª â™ª

30:28.673 --> 30:31.297
-I'll take it.
-It's all yours.

30:31.381 --> 30:34.381
â™ª

30:43.214 --> 30:44.464
What are you doin' here, Larry?

30:44.547 --> 30:46.130
I thought I told
you to get out
and not come back.

30:46.214 --> 30:48.923
Yeah, so you did, Mocha Joe.
So you did.

30:49.005 --> 30:50.756
I've merely come to inform you

30:50.839 --> 30:53.464
that I have leased
the place next door,

30:53.547 --> 30:56.047
where I'll be opening up
a coffee shop

30:56.130 --> 30:58.172
exactly the same as yours.

30:58.255 --> 31:00.714
Only charging
much lower prices.

31:00.798 --> 31:02.839
All for the express purpose

31:02.923 --> 31:04.756
of taking you down.

31:04.839 --> 31:07.089
Knock yourself out.
I welcome the competition.

31:07.172 --> 31:09.714
-Yeah.
-I'm not afraid of you.
You don't have the beans.

31:09.798 --> 31:12.964
I'm the only guy
in Los Angeles
who has these beans.

31:13.047 --> 31:15.130
-Yeah. I'll get beans.
-Oh, you won't find
better beans

31:15.214 --> 31:16.589
-than my beans.
-I'll get better beans.

31:16.673 --> 31:18.381
-No such thing as better beans.
-There are better beans,

31:18.464 --> 31:19.923
-Mocha Joe.
-No better beans, Larry.

31:20.005 --> 31:22.339
-I will find better beans.
-Mm-hmm, good luck.

31:22.422 --> 31:24.005
See ya, Larry.

31:24.089 --> 31:26.297
-You know what
I'm gonna call it?
-What?

31:26.381 --> 31:29.172
Latte Larry's.

31:33.631 --> 31:36.130
(panting)

31:39.130 --> 31:41.047
(doorbell chimes)

31:41.130 --> 31:43.756
â™ª

31:54.964 --> 31:56.589
Can I come in?

31:57.881 --> 31:59.130
Y-yes.

31:59.214 --> 32:00.714
-Yes, yes.
-Are you sure?

32:00.798 --> 32:03.547
Yeah, I'm positive.
I'm a little surprised,
is all.

32:03.631 --> 32:05.339
-Come in.
-Okay.

32:05.422 --> 32:06.589
-Wow.
-Well...

32:06.673 --> 32:08.089
Holy cow. I can't--

32:08.172 --> 32:10.422
-I can't believe you're here.
-You told me, right? I mean--

32:10.506 --> 32:12.839
Um...

32:14.964 --> 32:16.381
Give me two minutes.

32:16.464 --> 32:18.547
Two minutes.
I'll be right back.
Stay right there.

32:22.673 --> 32:25.756
-Leon: Ha-ha! (yells)
-(TV playing indistinctly)

32:25.839 --> 32:27.839
(Leon laughing)

32:28.089 --> 32:30.005
(knocking continues)

32:30.839 --> 32:33.005
-Fuckin' my movie up.
What you want?
-I need that talcum powder.

32:33.089 --> 32:36.464
-What you got goin' on?
-It's an emergency.
Get me the talcum powder!

32:36.547 --> 32:37.673
Leon:
Fuck!

32:38.422 --> 32:40.005
Who you tappin'?

32:40.089 --> 32:41.631
Cheryl.

32:42.089 --> 32:46.297
What? My man Larry David
re-tappin' that ass!

32:51.547 --> 32:52.881
Ooh.

32:54.047 --> 32:55.381
Ooh.

32:55.464 --> 32:57.464
-(Cheryl coughing)
-(Larry coughing)

32:57.547 --> 32:59.714
(huffing, coughing)

32:59.798 --> 33:02.839
(Cheryl gasps)
Did you powder down there?

33:02.923 --> 33:05.631
-No good?
-(coughs) I'm allergic.

33:05.714 --> 33:08.381
Oh! Oh, my God.

33:08.464 --> 33:10.422
-Oh, my God.
-(coughing)

33:10.506 --> 33:12.005
-Oh, my God.
-(gasping)

33:12.089 --> 33:14.589
-Oh! Call 9-1-1!
-(coughing)

33:14.673 --> 33:17.422
-Easy.
-(coughing)

33:17.714 --> 33:19.506
Hey. Jesus, slow down.

33:19.589 --> 33:22.381
-What happened?
-Oh, she, uh, swallowed
some talcum powder,

33:22.464 --> 33:24.339
and is having
an allergic reaction to it.

33:24.422 --> 33:25.756
Did she ingest anything else?

33:26.089 --> 33:27.589
(gasps)

33:27.881 --> 33:30.214
Kind of a personal question,
don't you think?

33:33.923 --> 33:35.422
So sorry!

33:37.714 --> 33:39.589
Oh, my God.
You look so much better.

33:39.673 --> 33:42.214
-Do I?
-Oh. (stammering)
Are you kidding?

33:42.297 --> 33:44.130
I couldn't even
look at you before.
I mean, it was...

33:44.214 --> 33:47.339
really, like, hideous.
You looked... disgusting.

33:47.422 --> 33:49.047
I could barely glance at you.

33:49.130 --> 33:50.673
Yeah, because of you.

33:50.756 --> 33:52.130
-Yeah.
-You're the one that

33:52.214 --> 33:54.172
put the talcum powder--
Uh, I'm allergic, and you--

33:54.255 --> 33:56.839
-It's because of you.
-Yeah. Yeah,
I'm sorry about that.

33:56.923 --> 33:58.964
Yeah. But you know,
I was thinking,

33:59.047 --> 34:01.839
if that happened
when we were married
and your face...

34:01.923 --> 34:04.381
for some reason,
stayed that way,

34:04.923 --> 34:06.506
what would I have done?

34:06.964 --> 34:08.714
What do you mean
what would you have done?

34:08.798 --> 34:11.714
Well, I mean,
could I have lived with you
looking like that?

34:11.798 --> 34:14.047
-You're such an asshole.
-(both laughing)

34:14.130 --> 34:17.422
You are such... I mean, I'm,
I'm fighting for my life,

34:17.506 --> 34:19.547
and this is what you're...
Susie?

34:19.631 --> 34:20.798
What are you guys doing here?

34:21.297 --> 34:22.839
What are you--
What are you doing here?

34:22.923 --> 34:25.214
Susie:
Randi had contractions,
and...

34:25.297 --> 34:27.714
She's walking around the halls
trying to induce,

34:27.798 --> 34:30.547
'cause nothing's happening,
so I thought I'd come
and keep her company.

34:30.631 --> 34:33.339
-Randi's here?
-Yeah. Cheryl, what happened?

34:33.422 --> 34:36.464
-She got stung by a wasp.
-I had an allergic reaction
to shellfish.

34:37.547 --> 34:38.881
Okay.

34:38.964 --> 34:42.339
I knew it.
I knew something was
going on with you two.

34:42.422 --> 34:43.714
I could smell it.

34:43.798 --> 34:45.881
That night at our house.
The ventriloquist.

34:45.964 --> 34:49.047
He drove you home.
Something's been going on here.

34:49.130 --> 34:50.673
I knew it. I knew it!

34:50.756 --> 34:52.798
Bravo!

34:52.881 --> 34:54.422
-Bravo, Poirot.
-(phone chimes)

34:54.506 --> 34:56.255
Cheryl:
Oh, no. Hey.

34:56.339 --> 35:00.422
-Ted is in the garage.
-Larry: What?

35:00.506 --> 35:02.297
-He's on his way up.
-Larry: What?

35:02.381 --> 35:03.589
You-- You can't be here.

35:03.673 --> 35:05.506
You better leave.
You better leave, Larry.

35:05.589 --> 35:07.255
How does he--
How does he know
you're in the hospital?

35:07.339 --> 35:08.756
Because he just flew in
from San Francisco

35:08.839 --> 35:10.172
and he texted me
when he landed. I...

35:10.255 --> 35:12.005
Because he's her
significant other,

35:12.089 --> 35:13.756
and you're her
significant nothing!

35:13.839 --> 35:16.214
-Just keep your
fuckin' trap shut!
-Susie: Go!

35:17.756 --> 35:18.714
Oh.

35:19.506 --> 35:21.464
-(Larry grunts)
-Hey!

35:21.839 --> 35:23.631
-(Larry grunts)
-Doctor: Just slow down!

35:24.172 --> 35:25.964
-Excuse me, sir!
-(Larry grunts)

35:28.005 --> 35:30.005
(Larry and Randi shriek)

35:31.089 --> 35:33.381
-God!
-Larry: Oh! Oh, my God!

35:33.464 --> 35:35.255
-Larry!
-You?

35:35.339 --> 35:38.130
Are you fucking kidding me,
you piece of shit?

35:38.214 --> 35:40.255
Okay, if anything
happens to this baby,

35:40.339 --> 35:41.756
it's gonna be your fault.

35:41.839 --> 35:43.631
Oh, please.
After what that fetus
has been through,

35:43.714 --> 35:45.172
this'll be a day
at the beach.

35:46.047 --> 35:47.714
Happy New Year!

35:48.506 --> 35:50.673
(theme music playing)

36:52.589 --> 36:53.589
LARRY DAVID:
It's a coffee place.

36:53.923 --> 36:55.464
I'm opening up a spite store
to take him out of business.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.923
I don't know what a spite store
is and I don't really care.

36:59.130 --> 37:00.714
Can I give you a little tip?

37:00.798 --> 37:02.297
If you're gonna
confront somebody,

37:02.381 --> 37:04.089
better to do it with pants on.

37:04.172 --> 37:05.089
The shorts...

37:05.422 --> 37:07.756
It's hard to take a person
seriously wearing shorts.

37:07.839 --> 37:09.172
I wanna give you a heads up.

37:09.381 --> 37:10.714
Susie's birthday's
in about a week.

37:10.798 --> 37:12.756
I already got her something.
It's gonna be a nice surprise.

37:12.839 --> 37:13.798
What is it?

37:14.714 --> 37:15.881
JEFF GARLIN:
What were you thinking?

37:15.964 --> 37:17.089
I'm done with presents!

37:17.172 --> 37:18.339
My birthday's coming up
in a month.

37:18.422 --> 37:19.798
-What are you getting me?!
-Nothing!

37:19.881 --> 37:21.714
-Oh, thank you!
-You're welcome!
