supposed to be hard.
This is like a muffin.

It's supposed to be fresh.

04:46.422 --> 04:47.881

-Yeah.
-You may have a looser
definition of scone than I do.

I don't think it's really
open to interpretation,
though.

08:31.756 --> 08:34.839
I have something from
the business manager
that you need to sign.

08:34.923 --> 08:36.798
Ah. All right.

08:37.756 --> 08:39.923
-Okay.
-Uh, it's just...

08:40.005 --> 08:42.214
There's an initial,
and a date,

08:42.297 --> 08:44.798
and I think three signatures.

08:45.714 --> 08:47.005
May I?

08:47.089 --> 08:49.339
Oh, what are you doing?
That's my shirt.

08:49.422 --> 08:51.297
Well, I was...
cleaning my glasses.

08:51.381 --> 08:54.089
You can't clean your glasses
with a shirt that I'm wearing

08:54.172 --> 08:55.297
while I'm wearing it.

08:55.381 --> 08:57.839
It's inappropriate.
It's crossing a boundary.

08:57.923 --> 09:00.506
-No good?
-No good.

09:00.589 --> 09:02.339
Hmm. (pops lips)
Okay.

09:02.422 --> 09:03.923
♪

09:06.422 --> 09:09.464
(party chatter)

09:10.714 --> 09:13.297
I know. Susie loves this house
even more than her last one.

09:13.381 --> 09:15.214
Well, the last one stunk.

09:15.297 --> 09:17.214
Cheryl:
It was too big.

09:17.297 --> 09:21.214
And he called me, uh...
He called me old and bald.

09:21.297 --> 09:22.798
-What?
-I swear to God.

09:22.881 --> 09:24.255
You know,
I'll tell you something.
I love coffee,

09:24.339 --> 09:26.381
and I love his coffee,
but you're one of my old--

09:26.464 --> 09:27.964
You are my oldest friend.

09:28.047 --> 09:29.798
I'm gonna boycott that place.

09:29.881 --> 09:31.923
-You're gonna boycott
Mocha Joe's?
-I'm boycotting.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.673
-Hey!
-Jeff: How about that?

09:33.756 --> 09:36.255
-I'm boycotting Mocha Joe.
You can't do that to my friend.
-Larry: Hey.

09:36.339 --> 09:38.089
-Look at this guy.
Look at this guy.
-That's a friend.

09:38.172 --> 09:39.506
We were in the same
hospital together.

09:39.589 --> 09:41.506
-He can't fuck with my friend.
-All right!

09:41.589 --> 09:43.589
-I'm gonna get some coffee.
-Larry: Okay.

09:43.673 --> 09:45.381
Enjoy your coffee.

09:45.464 --> 09:47.714
-He's boycotting.
-He's boycotting.
That's a big move.

09:47.798 --> 09:50.089
-Jeff: That's a big move,
a boycott.
-Oh, my God.

09:50.172 --> 09:52.756
Who invited you?
You pig.

09:52.839 --> 09:55.339
No, uh, Nancy, that is not
Harvey Weinstein.

09:55.422 --> 09:58.464
-I'm so sorry, Jeff.
My sister's from out of town.
-Jeff: Oh!

09:58.547 --> 10:00.422
-I'm just, I'm really sorry.
-Oh, my God. Oh, I'm so--

10:00.506 --> 10:03.005
-Jeff:
I'm the host of the party.
-Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

10:03.089 --> 10:04.589
Yes, I'm not Harvey Weinstein.

10:04.673 --> 10:06.589
-I'm sorry. Thank you.
I'm sorry.
-Jeff: Okay.

10:06.673 --> 10:08.756
(whispers):
He looks like Harvey Weinstein.
He looks just like him.

10:08.839 --> 10:11.255
-What the hell?
-Okay.

10:11.339 --> 10:15.547
All the time,
women, men--
doesn't matter.

10:15.631 --> 10:17.714
-Larry: Geez.
-And suddenly, I'm this guy.

10:17.798 --> 10:20.047
-Unbelievable.
-Unbelievable.

10:20.130 --> 10:23.589
I'm starving.
Oh! Pigs in a blanket.

10:23.673 --> 10:25.255
-What's better?
-Oh...

10:25.339 --> 10:28.506
I've been following
her around all night,
but she never has any.

10:28.589 --> 10:29.923
Jeff:
They go fast.

10:30.005 --> 10:32.464
I don't care how foo-foo
the other items are,

10:32.547 --> 10:34.798
-and people love 'em,
pigs in a blanket.
-Yeah.

10:34.881 --> 10:38.381
Larry, I am
extremely displeased
with your behavior.

10:38.464 --> 10:40.130
Ladies and gentlemen,

10:40.214 --> 10:43.464
the 16th president
of these United States...

10:43.547 --> 10:45.464
-Yeah, yeah. You're funny.
-...Abraham Lincoln.

10:45.547 --> 10:47.130
Let's give him
a big round of applause.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.547
-Like you know anything
about fashion.
-It is such an honor

10:49.631 --> 10:52.089
to be standing near you,
Mr. President.

10:52.172 --> 10:55.464
This hat is very similar
to the one that
Kate Middleton wore.

10:55.547 --> 10:57.714
-Okay? You don't know shit.
-Oh, really?

10:57.798 --> 10:59.881
-I know you look ridiculous.
How about that?
-Yeah. Yeah, fine.

10:59.964 --> 11:03.756
You act ridiculous.
Why are you harassing
my friend Randi at the gym?

11:03.839 --> 11:06.589
Hey, you know what?
Somebody has to stand up
for that fetus.

11:06.673 --> 11:08.005
You don't know anything
about fetuses.

11:08.089 --> 11:09.756
I know you don't go
on a treadmill

11:09.839 --> 11:11.464
eight months pregnant.
You don't have to be a genius

11:11.547 --> 11:13.214
-to figure that out.
-Why not? Why not?

11:13.297 --> 11:15.047
Do you think
that's good for fetus?
All that jostling?

11:15.130 --> 11:18.506
It's not your job
to mansplain to Randi!

11:18.589 --> 11:20.297
-Jeff, there's people
I want you to meet.
-Okay.

11:20.381 --> 11:23.005
"Four score and seven years ago,

11:23.089 --> 11:26.381
"our fathers brought forth
to this continent

11:26.464 --> 11:27.881
"a new nation,

11:27.964 --> 11:29.756
"conceived in liberty,

11:29.839 --> 11:31.756
-dedicated..."
-Larry, Happy New Year.

11:31.839 --> 11:33.255
You're too late.

11:33.339 --> 11:35.089
"Happy New Year."
Come on. It's three weeks.

11:35.172 --> 11:37.464
-Isn't it almost
a month already?
-It's ridiculous.

11:37.547 --> 11:39.714
Ah, look, well, they have
nothing to say, these people.

11:40.339 --> 11:43.255
-Oh, man.
-How do you know it's
a happy new year, anyway?

11:43.547 --> 11:45.923
-I can't believe it.
-What?

11:46.714 --> 11:49.339
Aw, I missed 'em again.
It's unbelievable.

11:49.422 --> 11:51.381
Hey, Larry!
Hey!

11:51.464 --> 11:52.589
-Hey.
-How you been?

11:52.673 --> 11:54.172
-Good.
-Yeah, great to see you.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.673
Shit. That's Rosen--

11:55.756 --> 11:56.923
-Phil Rosenthal.
-Phil Rosenthal.

11:57.005 --> 11:58.881
He just talks about
his shows all the time.

11:58.964 --> 12:02.422
His own show, and how about--
Romano is on 500 times a day.

12:02.506 --> 12:03.881
Somebody Feed Phil.

12:03.964 --> 12:06.214
Oh, geez, with all the chaos
in the world,

12:06.297 --> 12:07.923
in third-world countries,
feed him?

12:08.005 --> 12:09.214
He should be feeding
other people.

12:09.297 --> 12:11.047
It should be called
Phil Feeds Everybody.

12:11.130 --> 12:13.547
-You know what I'm gonna
do with him tonight?
-What's that?

12:13.631 --> 12:15.506
The Big Goodbye.

12:15.589 --> 12:17.214
I'm employing
The Big Goodbye.

12:17.297 --> 12:19.547
-It's the greatest
move in history.
-How great is The Big Goodbye?

12:19.631 --> 12:21.464
I've been doing it for years,
since you taught me.

12:21.547 --> 12:23.047
-You avoid the person
all night...
-Of course.

12:23.130 --> 12:25.089
And then at the end,
when you're about to leave,

12:25.172 --> 12:27.047
you go, "Ah!"
You give 'em
a big goodbye.

12:27.130 --> 12:30.673
-Then they feel good...
-Bye! Goodbye and good luck
to you and your family.

12:30.756 --> 12:33.214
They're very happy that
you spent this time with them

12:33.297 --> 12:34.714
at the end of the night, and...

12:34.798 --> 12:36.714
-and you slip out.
-It's genius.

12:36.798 --> 12:39.798
Um, are you up for doing
our old ventriloquist act?

12:39.881 --> 12:41.923
-I don't know.
Susie wants to see it.
-Yeah, I'll do it.

12:42.005 --> 12:43.047
-You will?
-Yeah.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.381
Okay, good.
Can we do it pretty soon?

12:44.464 --> 12:45.839
Because I want Ted to see it
before he leaves.

12:45.923 --> 12:47.714
-Of course.
-Thank you.

12:48.506 --> 12:50.005
Ted.

12:50.089 --> 12:51.839
-(all laughing)
-I'd like to thank
Jeff and Susie

12:51.923 --> 12:54.923
-for inviting us into
their beautiful home.
-I like the other one.

12:55.005 --> 12:56.798
(crowd laughing)

12:56.881 --> 12:58.881
Well, I think the house
is very nice.

12:58.964 --> 13:01.464
-(laughs)
-(crowd laughing)

13:01.547 --> 13:04.714
Did they throw that
fish smell in for free?

13:04.798 --> 13:07.881
(laughing)

13:07.964 --> 13:11.631
And, and, and look at all
our other friends who are
kind enough to join us.

13:11.714 --> 13:15.631
-There's, there's Ted Danson.
-Wow, is he handsome!

13:15.714 --> 13:17.255
He sure thinks so.

13:17.339 --> 13:20.005
-Oh!
-(laughing)

13:20.714 --> 13:22.964
And how about Susie,
our inimitable hostess?

13:23.047 --> 13:25.798
-(clapping)
-Susie, I love the curtains,

13:25.881 --> 13:27.881
but why did you make
a jacket out of it?

13:27.964 --> 13:30.964
-Crowd: Oh!
-(raucous laughter)

13:31.047 --> 13:33.798
-Are you having a good time?
-A good time?
Are you kidding me?

13:33.881 --> 13:37.464
I'm with a bunch of stiffs,
the food sucks, the drinks
aren't strong enough,

13:37.547 --> 13:38.631
and your hand is up my ass.

13:38.714 --> 13:40.881
(laughing)

13:41.339 --> 13:44.464
(laughing):
Hey. Don't look so down.

13:44.547 --> 13:46.589
(laughing)

13:47.255 --> 13:48.923
Are you mad?

13:49.005 --> 13:51.506
-Let's kiss and make up.
-I'm...

13:51.589 --> 13:55.756
-I'm not gonna kiss a dummy.
-I wouldn't. She's got a cold.

13:56.714 --> 13:59.089
Aw. That's the end!

13:59.172 --> 14:01.005
-(applause, laughter)
-Jeff: Bravo!

14:01.089 --> 14:03.464
Bravo! Cheryl and Larry.

14:03.547 --> 14:06.464
-Cheryl and Larry.
-(cheers, whistles)

14:06.547 --> 14:08.756
What a great audience.
Thank you. Thank you.

14:08.839 --> 14:12.214
-Fantastic.
Thank you all for coming.
-Susie: I love that bit.

14:12.297 --> 14:14.547
-Thanks for coming.
-Susie: Always loved that bit.

14:14.631 --> 14:17.339
-You were very funny.
-Thank you.

14:17.422 --> 14:19.923
-I'm sorry, but I gotta
catch my plane.
-Okay.

14:20.005 --> 14:22.506
Actually, you know what,
I better not.
I don't wanna catch a cold.

14:22.589 --> 14:24.339
-Cheryl: Oh, I know.
You gotta stay...
-I'm sorry. Yeah.

14:24.422 --> 14:26.422
-I'll call you when I land.
-...healthy. Okay.

14:26.506 --> 14:27.923
You don't need to call her
when you land.

14:28.005 --> 14:30.089
If there's a plane crash,
we'll know about it.

14:30.172 --> 14:32.214
-Okay. I'll walk you, Ted.
-Thank you, guys.

14:32.297 --> 14:34.547
-Susie: Thank you for coming.
-Ted: That was a great evening.

14:34.631 --> 14:36.756
♪

14:44.339 --> 14:46.547
Ah! There you are.
Finally gotcha.

14:46.631 --> 14:48.464
Sir, I need you
to get out of here.

14:48.547 --> 14:50.214
Get out of here?
What are you talking about?

14:50.297 --> 14:53.047
I need you to leave this room
'cause you've been ogling me...

14:53.130 --> 14:55.172
-the entire night.
-Ogling you? Are you nuts?

14:55.255 --> 14:57.839
-I, I, I've been ogling
the pigs in a blanket.
-Am I--

14:57.923 --> 14:59.381
Oh, my God. Yeah.

14:59.464 --> 15:02.297
-Not the first time
this has happened.
-What? I want one.

15:13.172 --> 15:14.297
Wow.

15:15.464 --> 15:17.881
-Ah. Hey.
-Hey. Excuse me.

15:17.964 --> 15:19.881
-Huh? Were we a hit?
-We were a hit.

15:19.964 --> 15:22.839
-We were the highlight
of this party.
-Highlight of the party.

15:22.923 --> 15:25.839
Yeah, I mean,
it's a been a while,
but we've still got it.

15:25.923 --> 15:28.255
-What are--
What are you doing?
-I'm gonna go home.

15:28.339 --> 15:30.255
-I'm just getting an Uber.
-Uber?

15:30.339 --> 15:32.798
-I'll take you home.
-You don't have to do that.

15:32.881 --> 15:34.255
Ah, it's nothing.

15:34.339 --> 15:37.172
-Okay. Okay.
Thank you. That's--
-Um, just give me...

15:37.255 --> 15:38.631
Give me two minutes.

15:38.714 --> 15:40.964
Okay. All right. Thanks.

15:41.714 --> 15:43.297
Are you kidding?

15:43.381 --> 15:46.339
I can't believe
I didn't get a chance
to talk to you all night,

15:46.422 --> 15:47.964
and now I'm on my way out.

15:48.047 --> 15:50.673
-What a shame.
-You giving me
The Big Goodbye?

15:50.756 --> 15:52.964
-The Big Goodbye? What are you--
What are you talking about?
-Big Goodbye.

15:53.047 --> 15:55.506
Where you avoid me all night,
and then you think you can

15:55.589 --> 15:57.839
cure it by having a Big Goodbye.
I know. I've been around.

15:57.923 --> 16:00.714
-I wasn't giving you a Big-- I
never heard of the Big Goodbye.
-It seems like a Big Goodbye.

16:00.798 --> 16:02.798
No, it wasn't.
It was just a normal goodbye.

16:02.881 --> 16:04.464
-That's a normal goodbye.
-Yeah?

16:04.547 --> 16:05.714
-Yeah.
-Really?

16:05.798 --> 16:06.964
Yeah. I wasn't trying
to avoid you.

16:07.047 --> 16:08.547
Are you kidding?
Why would I avoid you?

16:08.631 --> 16:10.172
Have lunch with me
Wednesday?

16:10.589 --> 16:12.297
We have a lot to talk about.
Listen,

16:12.381 --> 16:14.339
we're doing Raymond
in Portugal.

16:14.422 --> 16:16.839
Yeah.
Everybody Loves Joam.

16:16.923 --> 16:18.964
It's fantastic.
I get to go.

16:19.047 --> 16:20.839
And then I have the whole
Somebody Feed Phil  show.

16:20.923 --> 16:23.673
I want you to do my show.
I want to go to Ethiopia
with you.

16:23.756 --> 16:25.798
-(chuckles) Ethiopia.
-Ethiopia's great.

16:25.881 --> 16:27.464
I don't think I'm
running off to Ethiopia--

16:27.547 --> 16:28.964
Sure, you eat with your hands.
It's fantastic.

16:29.047 --> 16:30.464
-Everybody shares,
and, and the thing--
-I... I...

16:30.547 --> 16:32.255
-I don't like to leave
the continent, you know.
-No?

16:32.339 --> 16:33.631
-Nah.
-All right.
You know what?

16:33.714 --> 16:35.464
We'll start lunch Wednesday.
We'll see where it goes.

16:35.547 --> 16:37.923
Say yes to me
and you can go.

16:38.506 --> 16:40.381
-Okay.
-Okay.

16:40.464 --> 16:41.881
Larry: You know,
did I ever tell you

16:41.964 --> 16:44.381
that I once did a, uh,
premature Big Goodbye?

16:44.464 --> 16:46.631
So what does that mean?
You said goodbye and then
you didn't leave?

16:46.714 --> 16:48.923
-I did a Big Goodbye
and then I didn't--
-Come on.

16:49.005 --> 16:51.839
-And I didn't leave.
-And what did they do?
They were mad?

16:51.923 --> 16:54.673
-I ran into her in the kitchen
about an hour later.
-Come on.

16:54.756 --> 16:57.464
And what do you say?
What do you even say?

16:57.547 --> 16:59.673
She said,
"I thought you left."
I said, "Well, you know.

16:59.756 --> 17:02.631
I got, uh...
something happened."
I don't know.

17:02.714 --> 17:04.297
I made up a story.

17:04.381 --> 17:06.964
I, but I,
I can't believe that...

17:07.047 --> 17:08.506
that he knew about
the Big Goodbye.

17:08.589 --> 17:10.255
-(laughing)
-That was unbelievable to me.

17:10.339 --> 17:13.130
Well, I can't believe
that you kissed me when
you knew I had a cold.

17:13.214 --> 17:14.839
That was pretty unbelievable.

17:14.923 --> 17:17.089
Yeah. You...

17:18.297 --> 17:20.255
I would do it again.

17:29.839 --> 17:31.339
(sighs)

17:40.255 --> 17:42.089
Cheryl:
Wow, Larry.

17:42.506 --> 17:44.130
What are we doing?

17:44.714 --> 17:47.047
By the way,
before we get into that,

17:47.130 --> 17:49.214
are you aware that you have
a wobbly table here?

17:49.297 --> 17:52.547
Look at this.
Look at this table.
It's unbelievable.

17:52.631 --> 17:55.798
-I, I don't know how you
can go to bed at night.
-Yeah, it doesn't bother me.

17:55.881 --> 17:57.756
If all tables in
your house wobbled,

17:57.839 --> 17:59.964
you could live like that?
You could in a wobble-house?

18:00.047 --> 18:04.130
We need to talk about Ted.
We need to talk about everything
that just happened here.

18:04.214 --> 18:06.047
-What?
-What?

18:06.130 --> 18:08.172
-What are you so...
-Oh...

18:08.255 --> 18:09.756
I'm, I'm your ex-husband.

18:09.839 --> 18:12.047
Ted is such a good person.

18:12.130 --> 18:14.506
No, he's not such
a good person, okay?

18:14.589 --> 18:17.214
You don't do that.
You don't date
a friend's ex-wife.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.089
I mean, it's crazy.

18:19.673 --> 18:22.130
-You know what it is?
-Now... what?

18:22.214 --> 18:25.923
I think when I'm with you,
it makes me feel...

18:26.506 --> 18:28.923
-...better about myself?
-Morally superior.

18:29.005 --> 18:30.339
-Yes.
-Yes.

18:30.422 --> 18:32.089
-I hear that a lot. Yeah.
-Yeah. So, I'm not perfect,

18:32.172 --> 18:34.756
-but at least
I'm better than you.
-You're better than me.

18:34.839 --> 18:36.172
I can relate to
what you're saying,

18:36.255 --> 18:38.339
'cause I don't, I don't
feel that way with people.

18:38.422 --> 18:41.673
-I feel morally
inferior to people.
-Yeah.

18:41.756 --> 18:44.923
But I feel that way
with animals 'cause
they're generally so stupid,

18:45.005 --> 18:47.839
and I can--
especially insects,
I can crush them.

18:47.923 --> 18:50.089
You know, and, and
they eat each other.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.673
I mean, they're crazy,
animals. So, yeah.

18:52.756 --> 18:55.130
I feel smarter
and morally superior to them.

18:55.214 --> 18:56.798
(both laugh)

18:56.881 --> 19:00.381
-Hey. Uh... Let me
ask you something.
-Yeah?

19:01.255 --> 19:03.547
Is there any chance that...

19:04.422 --> 19:07.089
we might meet up again?

19:07.756 --> 19:09.589
We'll see.

19:09.673 --> 19:10.923
We'll see.

19:11.172 --> 19:14.214
-You can't stay here.
-I'm gonna tell you something,
okay?

19:14.297 --> 19:16.297
-If we ever got
back together...
-Yeah.

19:16.381 --> 19:19.798
...and somehow this table
appeared on, on our bedside...

19:19.881 --> 19:22.798
-Yeah?
-...it would be fixed
immediately.

19:22.881 --> 19:24.756
-Immediately.
-Oh, my God.

19:24.839 --> 19:27.673
-Larry: I could not live
with a wobbly table.
-Cheryl: Larry, please.

19:27.756 --> 19:29.214
-Go.
-Larry: Okay.

19:33.464 --> 19:35.047
Ha-ha!

19:35.130 --> 19:36.673
-What?
-Where the fuck you been at?

19:36.756 --> 19:38.506
-What are you? My mother?
-Fuck yeah, I am.

19:38.589 --> 19:40.673
All right,
I was at a party, okay?
I was at Jeff's party.

19:40.756 --> 19:42.506
-That party was over
a long time ago.
-Huh?

19:42.589 --> 19:45.673
Yeah. This right here--
This right here?
It's called tappin' hours.

19:45.756 --> 19:47.714
This is the hours when
people are tappin' ass.

19:47.798 --> 19:49.589
I'm not tappin'.
I'm not tappin'.

19:49.673 --> 19:51.464
Older white men should not
be out this fuckin' late.

19:51.547 --> 19:54.589
There's no late-night
yacht club,
or late-night garage sales

19:54.673 --> 19:56.422
and shit like that.
You out here fuckin'.

19:56.506 --> 19:58.005
When I'm tappin',
I always tell you.

19:58.089 --> 19:59.714
I come home and spread
the fuckin' news.

19:59.798 --> 20:01.381
You wanna know who I'm tappin'?
You wanna know who I'm tappin'?

20:01.464 --> 20:03.547
-Who the fuck you tappin'?
-(slams)

20:03.631 --> 20:06.255
Larry: I can't get out of it.
It's Phil Rosenthal.
He's just--

20:06.339 --> 20:08.005
What do you do?
How many times
can you say no?

20:08.089 --> 20:10.005
You couldn't do
the Big Goodbye?

20:10.089 --> 20:12.214
I did the Big Goodbye.
He saw right through it.

20:12.297 --> 20:13.756
Ah! You know what I'll do?

20:13.839 --> 20:15.339
I'll call you
in the middle of lunch.

20:15.422 --> 20:17.464
Say it's an emergency
and you gotta go.

20:17.547 --> 20:19.381
I did that the last time
I had lunch with him.

20:19.464 --> 20:21.464
Oh, boy.
That guy's relentless.

20:21.547 --> 20:24.589
Hey, Lar, that was
some party last night, huh?

20:25.130 --> 20:27.089
-Yeah, it was a great party.
-You had a good time?

20:27.172 --> 20:28.756
-I did. I had a nice time.
-Yeah.

20:28.839 --> 20:31.297
So you drove Cheryl home?

20:32.172 --> 20:33.255
Yep.

20:33.339 --> 20:34.756
That was very nice of you.

20:34.839 --> 20:37.005
-Considering Ted's
out of town--
-Yeah. I'm a nice guy.

20:37.089 --> 20:38.547
-Yeah.
-Yeah. I'm a nice guy.

20:38.631 --> 20:40.631
So, what, did you just
drop her off, or--

20:40.714 --> 20:42.881
-Yeah. Pretty much.
-Hmm.

20:42.964 --> 20:46.714
Dropped her off.
Said good night.
Went on my merry way.

20:46.798 --> 20:48.339
Mm-hmm.

20:49.881 --> 20:52.964
-Is there something
you would like to know, or--
-No, no, no.

20:53.047 --> 20:54.964
Something you're
not saying? Um...

20:55.047 --> 20:56.798
You know, can I person
not just ask

20:56.881 --> 20:59.589
-a, a normal question?
-No, they're not
normal questions.

20:59.673 --> 21:02.381
-There's a lot of implications.
A lot of implications.
-Larry: You're fishing--

21:02.464 --> 21:04.130
You're on a little
fishing expedition.

21:04.214 --> 21:05.756
You know,
you two are something.

21:05.839 --> 21:07.089
-You two make crap up--
-We're something?

21:07.172 --> 21:08.589
You know what?
You're something.

21:08.673 --> 21:10.589
Don't eat all the leftovers.
We need them for dinner.

21:10.673 --> 21:12.839
-Jeff: Sure, I won't.
-You're something.

21:13.673 --> 21:16.255
-I'll eat whatever
the fuck I want.
-That's right.

21:16.339 --> 21:17.923
Hey. Did you sleep with Cheryl?

21:18.005 --> 21:19.547
-Yeah.
-You did?

21:19.631 --> 21:22.255
-Yeah. Listen.
(chuckles)
-Ah.

21:22.339 --> 21:24.756
You cannot say anything
to Susie. Cannot.

21:24.839 --> 21:26.756
Under any circumstances.
Cheryl swore me to secrecy.

21:26.839 --> 21:28.005
She didn't want me to tell you.

21:28.089 --> 21:29.923
But I had to.
I couldn't--
How could I not?

21:30.005 --> 21:31.923
I'm a human being,
for God's sake.

21:32.005 --> 21:33.464
-I think it's great.
-Right?

21:33.547 --> 21:35.923
Yes. Wha--
What are you hoping
to get out of it, though?

21:36.005 --> 21:38.547
I'm hoping to get
back together, but...

21:38.631 --> 21:41.506
-I'll be surprised
if I see her again.
-Hmm.

21:41.589 --> 21:43.673
We on for golf on Saturday?

21:43.756 --> 21:45.297
Yeah. Um...

21:45.381 --> 21:47.130
Arnie Norton asked
if he could play.

21:47.214 --> 21:50.255
(scoffs)
I'm not playing with him.
He's a Trump supporter.

21:50.339 --> 21:52.589
-Never play with
a Trump supporter.
-Really?

21:52.673 --> 21:54.381
See him around town
with that hat.

21:54.464 --> 21:56.047
"Make America Great Again."

21:56.130 --> 21:58.089
I don't need that crap.

21:59.214 --> 22:02.089
He just--
He makes me want to
not be anywhere near him.

22:02.964 --> 22:06.464
I don't know.
You can check with Carl.
See if he wants to play.

22:06.547 --> 22:07.756
I gotta go.

22:09.130 --> 22:11.964
(Phil whistling)

22:12.506 --> 22:13.964
-Phil: Oh, hello, there.
-Hostess: Hi.

22:14.047 --> 22:16.381
Hi. I'm Phil Rosenthal.
I have a twelve o'clock.

22:16.464 --> 22:18.339
Oh, yes.
Mr. David's already here.

22:18.422 --> 22:20.756
-He is? Wow.
-Yes. Right this way.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.381
-Very impressive.
-He was early.

22:26.923 --> 22:28.255
Enjoy.

22:28.339 --> 22:30.631
Larry:
Hey, Phil!

22:31.547 --> 22:34.756
Good to see you.
Sit. Sit down. Sit down.

22:35.964 --> 22:38.798
Boy, I'm so glad we did this.
It was such a good idea.

22:38.881 --> 22:40.172
You, you were definitely right.

22:40.255 --> 22:42.005
I'm, I'm starving.
I hope this place is good.

22:42.089 --> 22:43.839
Yeah, yeah, it's great.
It's big portions

22:43.923 --> 22:46.005
on the food and everything.
It's really...

22:46.089 --> 22:48.089
a fantastic place. Um...

22:48.172 --> 22:50.381
You know what else?
I've been thinking...

22:50.464 --> 22:52.964
Really thinking about
this Ethiopia thing.

22:53.047 --> 22:55.214
Yeah, actually,
I heard that
we have some budget cuts,

22:55.297 --> 22:59.005
and Ethiopia's a little...
ex-expensive to shoot in.

22:59.089 --> 23:00.714
Wasn't that one of
the shithole countries?

23:00.798 --> 23:02.964
I can't remember if
that was on the list or not.

23:03.047 --> 23:05.839
-Oh, look. I'm getting a thing.
-Larry: Oh!

23:06.214 --> 23:08.673
Oh, yeah.
Oh, look at that.
Um, uh...

23:08.756 --> 23:11.214
My son's flight, uh,
got in early.

23:11.297 --> 23:13.714
-And I gotta get him.
I gotta go get him.
-Oh! Really?

23:13.798 --> 23:17.005
-Yeah, no, really.
-Let's... Send, send
an Uber or something.

23:17.089 --> 23:19.631
He needs to see me
because he has a little anxiety.

23:19.714 --> 23:21.381
No, no! You know what?
Phil...

23:21.464 --> 23:24.255
No, no.
We'll, we'll, we'll...
We'll... something.

23:27.130 --> 23:28.673
Ah!

23:28.756 --> 23:30.589
Fill her up.

23:31.464 --> 23:33.381
-Ah! Arigato!
-Yes.

23:33.464 --> 23:36.923
-Arigato!
-All right. Two seats
at the sushi bar.

23:44.130 --> 23:46.964
You know what?
Actually, I think we'd prefer
to sit at a table, please.

23:47.047 --> 23:48.714
Larry:
Huh.

23:50.339 --> 23:51.839
Sad.

23:51.923 --> 23:53.964
Very sad. Sad.

23:54.047 --> 23:56.089
(motorcycle rumbling)

23:56.172 --> 23:58.214

23:58.297 --> 24:01.130
-Biker: Hey! What
the fuck are you doing?
-Whoa.

24:01.214 --> 24:03.756
-Oh, God. Oh, God.
-Motherfucker!
What the fuck?

24:03.839 --> 24:05.506
What are you
trying to do, man?

24:05.589 --> 24:08.714
-What the fuck are you doing?
You little fucker!
-Oh, God. Oh, God.

24:08.798 --> 24:11.089
-I'm sorry, I didn't see you.
-What the fuck?

24:11.172 --> 24:13.714
-I'm sorry, I didn't see you!
-I'm ought to rip you
outta that fuckin' car!

24:13.798 --> 24:16.756
-You little shit.
-I'm sorry.
I didn't see you.

24:16.839 --> 24:19.214
Oh. Just be more careful
next time, okay?

24:19.297 --> 24:22.422
Will do. Will do.
Okay. Thank you.

I am boycotting this place.

Oh, this is a boycott?
Sitting here drinking coffee?

25:11.089 --> 25:12.589
That's a boy--
That's quite a boycott.

25:12.673 --> 25:15.714
I told you,
for the rest of
my dying days,

25:15.798 --> 25:18.255
I will never come

25:18.339 --> 25:20.047

-That's not what you said.

25:20.130 --> 25:22.339
-I said I was--
-You said you're
boycotting this place.

25:22.422 --> 25:24.464
And you're
never coming back here.
You didn't say with me.

25:24.547 --> 25:26.756
What are you?
My Jewish puppet master?

25:26.839 --> 25:28.756
I can do whatever
the fuck I want alone,

25:28.839 --> 25:30.839
-but with you,
I will never come in here.
-Look!

25:30.923 --> 25:32.172
I swear on my life.

25:32.255 --> 25:33.798
Who the fuck needs you
for a boycott

25:33.881 --> 25:36.130
if I'm boycotting already?
I don't need you

25:36.214 --> 25:37.714
to boycott.
You said you're boycotting,

25:37.798 --> 25:39.005
-but you didn't boycott.
-Are you done?

25:39.089 --> 25:40.714
I-- I don't understand.
I si-- (scoffs)

25:40.798 --> 25:42.798
-I don't understand you.
-(woman coughing)

25:43.506 --> 25:45.631
Oh, my God.
Now she's drinking coffee!

25:45.714 --> 25:47.506
-Richard: Who's that?
-Larry: It's unbelievable.

25:47.589 --> 25:49.714
-Richard: Who?
-Susie's friend. I saw her
in the gym the other day.

25:49.798 --> 25:52.130

Can I give you a little tip?

37:00.798 --> 37:02.297
If you're gonna
confront somebody,

37:02.381 --> 37:04.089
better to do it with pants on.

The shorts...

37:05.422 --> 37:07.756
It's hard to take a person
seriously wearing shorts.
