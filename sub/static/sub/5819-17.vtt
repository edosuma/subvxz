WEBVTT

00:01.248 --> 00:02.834
Previously on The Originals...

00:02.864 --> 00:05.052
If this prophecy is fulfilled,

00:05.082 --> 00:06.403
you will all fall.

00:06.433 --> 00:07.632
One by friend,

00:07.634 --> 00:10.469
one by foe, and one by family.

00:10.571 --> 00:12.871
- But now my sire link is undone.
- You're going to run.

00:12.873 --> 00:14.278
Don't stop driving until

00:14.308 --> 00:15.679
you're absolutely
certain that you are safe.

00:15.709 --> 00:16.854
You don't have to remind me

00:16.884 --> 00:18.449
how precious my cargo is.

00:18.679 --> 00:20.083
The spell you used brought me back

00:20.113 --> 00:22.035
as I was when I died in this body.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.231
It's worse than I remember.

00:23.233 --> 00:24.699
The rage, the hunger...

00:24.701 --> 00:26.940
It's been growing
worse since I came back.

00:28.555 --> 00:30.944
There was never any
hope for you, brother.

00:31.127 --> 00:32.563
Finn.

00:32.593 --> 00:34.142
And the spell decreed

00:34.144 --> 00:36.478
that the white oak
tree that gave us life

00:36.480 --> 00:37.718
could also take it away.

00:37.748 --> 00:39.114
The Ancestors...

00:40.502 --> 00:43.493
They want me to help him.

00:45.292 --> 00:47.355
Hello, luv.

00:48.389 --> 00:50.141
A Mikaelson witch,

00:50.143 --> 00:51.776
a white oak bullet,

00:51.778 --> 00:55.134
and I'd say we have the
recipe for some real fun.

01:00.058 --> 01:02.821
After all that flirtation,

01:02.823 --> 01:04.839
this is your idea of a first date?

01:06.059 --> 01:08.331
Think of it as a date with destiny, luv.

01:08.361 --> 01:10.550
Though I admit, three is a crowd.

01:10.580 --> 01:12.702
Vincent is a necessary evil, I'm afraid,

01:12.732 --> 01:14.870
here to keep you in check
should you misbehave.

01:14.900 --> 01:15.923
Yeah, you're leaving out the part

01:15.953 --> 01:18.641
where I ain't exactly here
of my own volition, man.

01:18.671 --> 01:21.026
The Ancestors must have
lost their damn minds.

01:21.056 --> 01:22.463
Quite the opposite.

01:22.493 --> 01:24.376
I've never dealt with a saner bunch.

01:24.378 --> 01:25.994
See, when I arrived in New Orleans,

01:25.996 --> 01:27.318
I made them a deal.

01:27.598 --> 01:30.432
Upon my request, they would
grant me access to the Regent,

01:30.434 --> 01:31.922
and in exchange, I'd provide for them

01:31.952 --> 01:33.961
a world without the Originals.

01:33.991 --> 01:36.261
Ah... didn't take much convincing.

01:36.654 --> 01:39.329
They do despise your family.

01:45.248 --> 01:46.353
We're here.

01:46.383 --> 01:48.463
Yeah, but where the hell is "here," man?

01:48.493 --> 01:49.824
What...?

01:50.657 --> 01:52.285
How disappointing!

01:52.315 --> 01:54.111
Two powerful witches who cannot sense

01:54.141 --> 01:56.625
when you're treading on hallowed ground?

01:59.263 --> 02:02.397
Welcome... to Mystic Falls.

02:03.408 --> 02:06.318
The place where it all began.

02:07.158 --> 02:12.006
Where Esther Mikaelson
created the vampire species.

02:14.136 --> 02:16.445
Under the shade of the
infamous white oak tree,

02:16.447 --> 02:20.438
she crafted the spell that
turned each of her children,

02:20.468 --> 02:23.452
and I mean to replicate that spell.

02:24.117 --> 02:25.287
I have everything I need

02:25.289 --> 02:27.789
to become what I deserve to be.

02:28.897 --> 02:30.509
You want to become an Original.

02:30.511 --> 02:32.294
Do I look like the sort who'd settle

02:32.296 --> 02:34.552
for some shoddy Original model?

02:35.846 --> 02:38.433
I intend to be an upgrade.

02:38.463 --> 02:39.940
You're insane

02:39.970 --> 02:42.837
to think I'd ever help
you craft any spell.

02:42.839 --> 02:44.545
Oh, no, no, no, you misunderstand.

02:44.575 --> 02:46.541
Vincent will handle the spell.

02:46.978 --> 02:48.910
From you...

02:48.912 --> 02:52.383
I need something a bit more intimate.

02:54.863 --> 02:59.163
== sync & corrections by Wolfhound ==
== www.addic7ed.com ==

03:03.465 --> 03:05.831
Seems your friend stood us up.

03:06.263 --> 03:08.517
Vincent's not exactly my friend.

03:08.519 --> 03:11.853
Well, since we bothered to be
the only ones who turned up,

03:11.905 --> 03:15.040
it would be a shame
to leave empty-handed.

03:15.558 --> 03:17.968
Why not head back, get up to no good?

03:19.263 --> 03:20.929
Something's not right.

03:23.319 --> 03:25.934
Vincent said we were up
against a "common threat."

03:25.936 --> 03:27.892
Now he's missing.

03:28.239 --> 03:31.695
St. James is the one
place in New Orleans

03:31.725 --> 03:33.191
where magic doesn't work.

03:33.193 --> 03:34.741
Why would a Regent
want to meet somewhere

03:34.771 --> 03:36.934
where he can't do magic?

03:38.000 --> 03:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:52.713 --> 03:55.660
Davina, I'm trying to warn you.

04:09.312 --> 04:10.729
This is his.

04:14.735 --> 04:16.767
Davina, listen... I know we are not

04:16.769 --> 04:18.808
on the best of terms, but I
need you to listen to me, okay?

04:18.838 --> 04:21.606
Um, we're in serious trouble.

04:21.608 --> 04:24.693
Now, I'm recording this
here because it's...

04:24.931 --> 04:26.000
it's free from magic,

04:26.030 --> 04:31.309
and magic is our enemy.

04:32.035 --> 04:33.260
The Ancestors got me on the hook

04:33.290 --> 04:36.977
doing some pretty twisted
magic and I want no part of it,

04:37.007 --> 04:39.972
but they're forcing me
to help Lucien Castle.

04:40.561 --> 04:42.060
And if you don't help me,

04:42.062 --> 04:44.389
Freya Mikaelson's gonna die.

04:46.963 --> 04:48.305
Before they forced me to take her,

04:48.335 --> 04:49.647
then they had me put
up a cloaking spell,

04:49.677 --> 04:50.625
so we can't be tracked.

04:50.655 --> 04:52.326
Now, Lucien's taking us
out of town someplace,

04:52.356 --> 04:53.939
I don't know where...

04:54.514 --> 04:56.789
but there's a loophole.

04:57.674 --> 04:58.894
Just how am I the loophole?

04:58.924 --> 05:00.784
Last year, when Esther
first brought us back,

05:00.814 --> 05:03.270
I got put in the body
of a gormless twit,

05:03.300 --> 05:05.072
but you got housed in
one of the most powerful

05:05.102 --> 05:07.591
witch bodies in the city: Vincent's.

05:07.621 --> 05:09.843
And even after all this
time, there's still an echo

05:09.873 --> 05:13.004
of a body-soul connection
between you two.

05:14.168 --> 05:15.460
And Davina, that's
where you come into play.

05:15.490 --> 05:18.039
I need a powerful witch that's
off the Ancestors' radar.

05:20.007 --> 05:22.744
I want you to find

05:22.774 --> 05:24.503
the thread

05:24.533 --> 05:28.558
between me and Finn.

05:29.643 --> 05:31.526
Have you ever done anything like this?

05:31.556 --> 05:34.038
I don't even know if it's possible.

05:35.032 --> 05:36.731
But I do have Vincent's blood.

05:38.847 --> 05:40.240
If I can take Finn's blood

05:40.270 --> 05:41.020
and do the spell right,

05:41.050 --> 05:43.776
I should be able to track Vincent down.

05:43.806 --> 05:44.802
I should have sensed

05:44.832 --> 05:46.859
something was wrong
when Freya didn't call.

05:46.889 --> 05:49.027
Now Lucien has a head start.

05:49.029 --> 05:50.529
Go, witch.

05:50.781 --> 05:52.018
Tend to your spells.

05:52.048 --> 05:53.754
I won't rest until she's found.

05:53.784 --> 05:55.784
Behold, the selfless martyr.

05:55.786 --> 05:57.741
First, he wants to rip Davina's head off

05:57.771 --> 05:58.975
for trapping him in his body.

05:59.005 --> 06:00.443
Now he can't wait to be spelled.

06:00.473 --> 06:01.973
Finn...

06:02.168 --> 06:03.068
you and I shall go together.

06:03.098 --> 06:03.982
Kol, you stay here

06:04.012 --> 06:05.433
- with Davina, please.
- You're going with him?

06:05.463 --> 06:07.798
So the two people responsible

06:07.828 --> 06:10.303
for not destroying the white
oak when they had the chance,

06:10.333 --> 06:11.922
thus putting us in this bloody mess,

06:11.952 --> 06:13.251
are now off to try and fix it.

06:13.253 --> 06:14.625
That's just marvelous.

06:14.655 --> 06:16.321
I mean, what could possibly go wrong?

06:16.323 --> 06:18.445
Kol, look at me.

06:18.475 --> 06:20.143
I don't know this magic.

06:20.173 --> 06:22.315
I need your help.

06:22.829 --> 06:23.824
Come on.

06:23.854 --> 06:25.187
Let's go.

06:37.443 --> 06:38.560
Let us begin.

06:38.610 --> 06:40.699
Do not give me orders, brother.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.200
And make no mistake.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.531
I do not look to you as an ally,

06:44.561 --> 06:46.109
or even family.

06:46.139 --> 06:48.139
The only reason I tolerate your presence

06:48.141 --> 06:51.528
is the hope of finding Freya.

06:53.483 --> 06:55.386
If you find him, don't esitate.

06:55.416 --> 06:56.915
Hope's down for the count.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.751
She fell asleep as soon
as Mary started the car.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.847
I doubt she'll miss either
of us over the next few days.

07:03.274 --> 07:04.378
So...

07:04.408 --> 07:07.659
which of these Kingmaker
offices should we hit up first?

07:09.347 --> 07:10.876
There's ten of them.

07:13.095 --> 07:14.591
What?

07:15.029 --> 07:18.286
Lucien has revealed his true nature.

07:18.288 --> 07:19.804
He's taken Freya.

07:20.121 --> 07:21.795
And now it seems her rescue depends

07:21.825 --> 07:25.777
on Elijah working with my
ever-reliable brother Finn.

07:25.910 --> 07:27.001
Oh.

07:27.133 --> 07:30.279
And you want to go back to New
Orleans to head up the hunt?

07:32.051 --> 07:33.106
Fine.

07:33.136 --> 07:34.291
You should go.

07:34.321 --> 07:36.188
I'm sticking with Kingmaker, though.

07:36.190 --> 07:38.829
Lucien's working very hard to
cover up these wolf kidnappings

07:38.859 --> 07:39.963
and I want to know why.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.126
No.

07:41.156 --> 07:43.267
The wolves, Freya's abduction...

07:43.297 --> 07:44.763
it can't all be coincidence.

07:45.111 --> 07:47.904
We'll let my brothers
pursue the obvious path.

07:47.934 --> 07:50.551
You and I... will pursue this one.

07:50.581 --> 07:52.971
No doubt all roads...

07:53.001 --> 07:55.841
lead to the same treacherous bastard.

07:59.674 --> 08:00.970
Okay.

08:01.264 --> 08:02.947
Okay, man, that's enough!

08:02.977 --> 08:04.265
Hmm, right you are.

08:04.267 --> 08:06.968
That should just about do it.

08:11.377 --> 08:13.325
Here, let me see it.

08:14.076 --> 08:14.981
Enough!

08:15.011 --> 08:17.868
There is a spell that needs doing.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.140
Lest the Ancestors melt

08:19.170 --> 08:21.616
that precocious little brain of yours.

08:21.618 --> 08:22.901
What's that?

08:22.903 --> 08:24.569
That's not exactly need-to-know.

08:29.519 --> 08:33.628
This part's all you.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.086
This is it.

08:42.087 --> 08:44.389
This is the spell that
created the Originals.

08:44.391 --> 08:48.643
Took an entire coven ages
to reverse-engineer it.

08:49.698 --> 08:53.982
And then I had to get my hands on this.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.736
No.

08:58.738 --> 09:00.104
No way, man.

09:00.106 --> 09:01.439
I'm not doing this for you.

09:01.441 --> 09:02.733
Wh... Ah! Ah...

09:02.763 --> 09:05.610
Seems the Ancestors beg to differ.

09:07.163 --> 09:09.614
Now get to work

09:09.616 --> 09:10.999
like a good chap.

09:27.987 --> 09:30.051
They should keep heading northeast.

09:30.053 --> 09:31.686
What, northeast?

09:31.688 --> 09:33.137
They've been driving
northeast for an hour, luv.

09:33.139 --> 09:34.439
We need to get a tad more specific

09:34.441 --> 09:35.940
before they hit the Atlantic Ocean.

09:35.942 --> 09:37.642
The soul-blood connection

09:37.644 --> 09:39.027
is not as strong as a locator spell.

09:39.029 --> 09:40.728
The most I can narrow it down to

09:40.730 --> 09:42.697
is Virginia; northern Virginia.

09:42.699 --> 09:44.649
You're bloody joking.

09:45.652 --> 09:47.318
We were born in northern Virginia.

09:50.490 --> 09:54.208
There's a one-horse town
there now called Mystic Falls.

09:54.210 --> 09:56.044
We were turned into vampires there.

09:56.046 --> 09:57.879
That's too much of a coincidence.

09:57.881 --> 09:59.414
Can you please be a little more precise?

09:59.416 --> 10:00.665
No. I need to boost the signal somehow.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.000
Maybe some black cohosh...

10:02.002 --> 10:04.002
Black cohosh won't do it!

10:06.467 --> 10:07.467
Sorry.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.558
Look, I have a better idea.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.010
A Blood Rider.

10:13.179 --> 10:14.762
A Tibetan singing bowl

10:14.764 --> 10:16.981
I had cast into a dark
object in the 1800s.

10:16.983 --> 10:19.150
It's like an echo chamber.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.818
With Finn's blood, we can amplify

10:20.820 --> 10:23.354
the connection he has with Vincent.

10:23.356 --> 10:27.191
But, like everything of
mine, Klaus's ex has it now.

10:27.193 --> 10:29.193
I guess I'll just have to
pry it out of her hands.

10:29.195 --> 10:30.195
Hey!

10:31.865 --> 10:34.365
Cami is my friend.

10:34.367 --> 10:35.867
Now, if you can't play nice,

10:35.869 --> 10:38.036
you're gonna sit here
and I'll go get it.

10:40.707 --> 10:42.206
Okay.

10:43.676 --> 10:45.259
I'll behave.

10:45.749 --> 10:47.712
Let's go.

10:55.906 --> 10:57.388
All this effort

10:57.390 --> 11:01.025
to become a sad copy of an Original?

11:01.027 --> 11:03.728
You think you can just

11:03.730 --> 11:05.480
wake up one day

11:05.482 --> 11:07.231
and become top of the food chain?

11:09.652 --> 11:13.704
It did not happen
overnight, I assure you.

11:13.706 --> 11:15.073
The truth is,

11:15.075 --> 11:18.576
I used to think your siblings gods.

11:19.080 --> 11:22.713
Until my love was stolen

11:22.715 --> 11:25.299
and our lives taken by their compulsion.

11:25.301 --> 11:27.418
Once free, I realized

11:27.420 --> 11:30.588
they were not worthy of all
that had been gifted them.

11:30.590 --> 11:32.090
I decided, then,

11:32.092 --> 11:34.509
that I would become, in flesh,

11:34.511 --> 11:37.145
what I have always been:

11:37.147 --> 11:38.763
their better.

11:40.433 --> 11:43.651
I have engineered every second since

11:43.653 --> 11:45.436
into achieving this moment.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.738
You faked the prophecy.

11:47.740 --> 11:49.740
Oh, no.

11:49.742 --> 11:53.077
When I found the prophecy
foretelling your family's end,

11:53.079 --> 11:55.079
I knew it was true...

11:55.081 --> 11:57.448
and that I was its living embodiment.

11:59.786 --> 12:01.752
It is my rise

12:01.754 --> 12:04.288
that shall be their downfall.

12:27.360 --> 12:29.171
Of course.

12:29.656 --> 12:32.275
Mystic Falls.

12:32.791 --> 12:34.444
Birthplace of all our sorrows.

12:36.648 --> 12:39.349
So are we to drive around
this entire pathetic town,

12:39.351 --> 12:41.684
hoping to run into my sister
before Lucien murders her?

12:41.686 --> 12:42.986
Kol has a plan.

12:42.988 --> 12:44.687
Kol and his ridiculous gambits.

12:44.689 --> 12:46.356
900 years in a box...

12:46.358 --> 12:47.941
and zero patience.

12:47.943 --> 12:50.527
It's all a joke to you, isn't it?

12:53.198 --> 12:55.915
"900 years in a box"
just rolls off your tongue

12:55.917 --> 12:59.419
as if the time passed
without consequence.

12:59.421 --> 13:01.204
I assure you, it did not.

13:01.206 --> 13:02.705
What are you suggesting?

13:02.707 --> 13:04.007
We never experienced anything,

13:04.009 --> 13:05.341
least of all the passage of time.

13:05.343 --> 13:07.126
Being daggered for decades

13:07.128 --> 13:09.796
and being daggered for centuries
are very different things.

13:11.016 --> 13:15.185
It starts off as a
dim pinprick of light,

13:15.187 --> 13:17.220
growing brighter year after year,

13:17.479 --> 13:20.223
a slow consciousness

13:20.225 --> 13:22.442
that I was paralyzed.

13:22.444 --> 13:24.894
Entombed in my own mind.

13:27.449 --> 13:29.065
That despair...

13:31.620 --> 13:35.288
Utter loneliness...

13:35.290 --> 13:39.075
All amplified and made endless.

13:47.424 --> 13:49.325
I know it's here somewhere.

13:50.639 --> 13:52.589
Hard to keep track of
all your stolen goods?

13:52.591 --> 13:55.258
Kol, my family did not steal these.

13:55.260 --> 13:57.094
They just kept the very deadly toys

13:57.096 --> 13:58.512
you left strewn about this city

13:58.514 --> 13:59.980
from falling into even deadlier hands.

13:59.982 --> 14:02.516
You know what, luv? I'm here now.

14:02.518 --> 14:04.267
So maybe I should take back what's mine.

14:04.269 --> 14:06.103
Let's see what happens if you try.

14:06.105 --> 14:07.104
Oh, that sounds like fun to me.

14:07.106 --> 14:08.492
Kol!

14:11.994 --> 14:13.443
Get out.

14:17.666 --> 14:18.949
I am sorry.

14:18.951 --> 14:20.283
I think he's getting used

14:20.285 --> 14:22.285
to being a vampire again.

14:23.672 --> 14:24.955
I'm sure you can relate.

14:25.265 --> 14:26.339
Yeah.

14:27.031 --> 14:28.542
If that's his problem.

14:29.444 --> 14:31.360
What does that mean?

14:33.264 --> 14:36.182
I've seen that look before, Davina.

14:36.184 --> 14:37.984
My uncle...

14:37.986 --> 14:39.652
after he was cursed.

14:41.773 --> 14:43.489
Kol's not cursed.

14:43.491 --> 14:44.349
I'd be able to tell.

14:44.379 --> 14:45.379
Would you?

14:48.747 --> 14:50.413
Look, maybe I'm wrong.

14:50.415 --> 14:54.300
Just... be careful, okay?

14:56.989 --> 14:58.438
Thanks, Cami.

15:03.078 --> 15:04.611
How will we know when or if

15:04.613 --> 15:06.196
this magic trick of Kol's works?

15:06.198 --> 15:07.447
He's says you'll know.

15:12.921 --> 15:15.705
It's strange.

15:15.707 --> 15:18.091
The birthplace of our very misfortune,

15:18.093 --> 15:19.709
beyond that hill.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.845
Do you recall the first
time we fled together, Finn?

15:21.847 --> 15:24.214
We were but children.

15:24.216 --> 15:26.716
Nothing but the clothes on our back,

15:26.718 --> 15:29.052
desire we had no idea how to control

15:29.054 --> 15:31.104
and a father hell-bent on
erasing us from the earth.

15:31.106 --> 15:32.605
The first of many times we ran together

15:32.607 --> 15:34.274
over the next 100 years,

15:34.276 --> 15:35.475
till you all left me
entombed for nine centuries.

15:35.477 --> 15:37.060
- You were a danger. ‭
- Danger?

15:37.062 --> 15:38.297
- Yes. ‭
- Klaus and Kol killed

15:38.327 --> 15:39.201
everything that moved.

15:39.231 --> 15:41.314
Yet I was the one considered
too dangerous to undagger?

15:41.316 --> 15:43.400
Despite their blood-lust, you
were the poison that crippled...

15:43.402 --> 15:44.617
Poison?

15:44.619 --> 15:45.902
I anchored us.

15:45.904 --> 15:47.204
You despised us.

15:47.589 --> 15:50.207
You despised yourself.

15:50.714 --> 15:52.626
Terrified of everything that we became.

15:53.180 --> 15:55.251
You threatened our very survival, Finn,

15:55.281 --> 15:56.596
just as you have every time

15:56.598 --> 15:58.504
we made the mistake of
freeing you from that box.

15:58.534 --> 16:00.867
I was made that way because of that box!

16:03.346 --> 16:05.122
Every time I close my eyes,

16:05.124 --> 16:07.374
I go back to that black horizon,

16:08.300 --> 16:10.293
that place where I was
abandoned and forgotten

16:10.934 --> 16:12.462
by my own family.

16:15.347 --> 16:16.516
So, yeah,

16:16.518 --> 16:18.385
I came out mad.

16:18.387 --> 16:19.970
And I remain so.

16:33.535 --> 16:35.485
Does he just build these
from a kit or something?

16:35.487 --> 16:38.321
It's the exact same for
the last five offices.

16:38.323 --> 16:39.573
Same windows, same plants...

16:39.575 --> 16:40.824
And inside,

16:40.826 --> 16:42.659
same generic abstract art,

16:42.661 --> 16:44.995
same compellable receptionist.

16:45.340 --> 16:47.831
Are you sure you wouldn't be
better off with your brothers?

16:47.833 --> 16:49.049
I can do the leg work.

16:49.051 --> 16:50.834
And split up the team now?

16:50.836 --> 16:52.752
Just when I'm discovering
your carpool karaoke skills?

16:52.754 --> 16:55.197
I think not. ‭...

16:55.636 --> 16:57.641
No, Lucien is playing a game here.

16:57.643 --> 16:59.342
Each unassuming little
office building we search,

16:59.344 --> 17:01.305
the more sure I am of it.

17:01.335 --> 17:02.512
We keep going.

17:02.842 --> 17:04.013
Together.

17:04.016 --> 17:07.349
Even if we have to scour
100 of these poxy places.

17:08.709 --> 17:09.853
I hate it here.

17:09.855 --> 17:11.521
This place birthed all
our pain and sorrow.

17:11.522 --> 17:14.324
I refuse to let it be the
place where our sister dies.

17:14.326 --> 17:16.751
Let us not wait for Kol
and his witch's tricks...

17:16.781 --> 17:19.502
let us simply tear this
town apart and find her.

17:19.532 --> 17:21.531
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

17:24.269 --> 17:27.747
See, I just ran every single
vampire out of this town, so...

17:27.777 --> 17:31.908
visiting hours are, well... never.

18:34.455 --> 18:36.261
Ah, hello, luv.

18:36.291 --> 18:38.007
We're here for a spot of search

18:38.009 --> 18:39.709
and potentially destroy.

18:40.079 --> 18:45.445
Do tell, where are the areas
off-limits to general staff?

18:45.605 --> 18:47.455
You just wait right here...

18:48.610 --> 18:50.243
and I'll have someone out here

18:50.245 --> 18:52.245
to help you with your inquiry.

18:58.787 --> 18:59.869
Shall we?

18:59.871 --> 19:02.004
Ladies first.

19:10.298 --> 19:11.764
Ah!

19:53.146 --> 19:55.553
They're all wolves.

20:04.415 --> 20:06.966
Klaus, they're still alive.

20:16.728 --> 20:18.928
This one's a vampire.

20:22.584 --> 20:25.251
What the hell is Lucien up to here?

20:27.706 --> 20:29.956
Elijah Mikaelson.

20:29.958 --> 20:31.502
Matthew Donovan.

20:31.532 --> 20:33.593
How adorably inconvenient.

20:33.595 --> 20:36.879
Unfortunately, we don't
have time to play right now.

20:36.881 --> 20:39.882
I'll pass your regards along to Rebekah.

20:39.884 --> 20:41.384
Finn, isn't it?

20:41.913 --> 20:43.079
Sorry, I suck at names,

20:43.109 --> 20:45.972
but I never forget a face.

20:47.502 --> 20:50.264
Especially when it's
someone I've already killed.

20:50.294 --> 20:52.294
That was right over there, right?

20:54.048 --> 20:55.737
Did you come back for some more?

20:55.767 --> 20:56.972
Do you expect to scare me

20:57.002 --> 20:58.368
with that crude little toy?

20:58.370 --> 20:59.950
Why are you here?

20:59.980 --> 21:03.092
My sister Freya has been taken.

21:03.586 --> 21:06.042
Yes, we have another.

21:06.393 --> 21:07.544
Option one:

21:07.546 --> 21:10.547
You go about your business
like a good little boy.

21:11.223 --> 21:13.049
Option two:

21:13.051 --> 21:15.268
Violent disembowelment.

21:17.389 --> 21:18.841
What's it gonna be?

21:18.871 --> 21:20.557
I'm gonna go with option three:

21:20.559 --> 21:21.891
This is my town.

21:21.893 --> 21:22.886
My business.

21:22.916 --> 21:24.828
Especially when it comes
to anything with fangs.

21:25.439 --> 21:27.156
Now, you, me and these
ten wooden hollow points

21:27.158 --> 21:29.681
can stand here and
argue that fact, but...

21:29.711 --> 21:31.494
how much time does
your sister really have?

21:34.141 --> 21:35.481
With Finn's blood,

21:35.483 --> 21:38.618
we can amplify the connection
he has with Vincent.

21:38.620 --> 21:40.953
All right, let go of everything.

21:40.955 --> 21:42.905
Feel the vibration.

21:46.327 --> 21:49.245
Now, harmonize with the
cadence of the drone.

22:00.324 --> 22:02.324
And once they're both in harmony,

22:02.326 --> 22:06.162
it should continue by itself.

22:06.164 --> 22:09.498
And it's up to you to concentrate.

22:09.759 --> 22:11.667
To amplify it.

22:36.321 --> 22:38.027
Finn?

22:39.848 --> 22:42.364
I know where they are.

22:54.646 --> 22:56.378
Freya, I'm so sorry.

22:57.198 --> 22:59.315
Can't let you do that.

23:06.458 --> 23:08.074
Aah!

23:12.997 --> 23:14.997
You're making a mistake.

23:20.004 --> 23:21.838
No one has to die today.

23:22.407 --> 23:25.525
Oh, oh, sweet Freya.

23:30.080 --> 23:32.866
Today is the beginning
of an awful lot of death.

23:33.668 --> 23:35.968
Starting with yours, I'm afraid.

23:37.445 --> 23:38.445
Truly...

23:38.801 --> 23:41.056
you and I could've been quite the thing.

23:41.058 --> 23:42.424
Lucien?

23:42.426 --> 23:44.093
Oh.

23:45.714 --> 23:48.381
Just in time for the party, lads.

23:48.383 --> 23:50.500
Cheers.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.173
Let the fun begin.

23:58.175 --> 23:59.975
Can either of you get to me

23:59.977 --> 24:03.095
faster than I can rip your
darling sister's head off?

24:05.146 --> 24:07.849
Didn't think so.

24:16.160 --> 24:19.194
Oh, you clever bastard.

24:23.279 --> 24:26.034
Hold her. Hold her head.

24:46.093 --> 24:48.594
Help me with this one.

24:55.553 --> 24:56.886
No vampire blood.

24:56.888 --> 24:57.837
That's okay.

24:57.839 --> 24:58.838
The others drank.

24:58.840 --> 24:59.839
I'm a hybrid.

24:59.841 --> 25:01.056
Go on.

25:01.492 --> 25:03.359
Go on.

25:07.535 --> 25:09.782
He needed their venom.

25:13.171 --> 25:16.088
Lucien's cure for werewolf bites.

25:18.376 --> 25:19.959
He harvested the venom he needed,

25:19.961 --> 25:22.078
then reverse-engineered a vaccine.

25:22.480 --> 25:24.163
Clever stuff.

25:24.165 --> 25:25.614
And her?

25:25.616 --> 25:27.649
The dead vampire?

25:30.121 --> 25:32.004
It was the wolf venom that killed her.

25:33.257 --> 25:35.724
Just Lucien testing his cure.

25:36.126 --> 25:37.659
Why does he need to test out something

25:37.661 --> 25:40.379
he knows already works?

25:43.334 --> 25:44.472
- ‭
- It's okay.

25:44.502 --> 25:46.035
You're okay.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.109
Where is he?

25:49.139 --> 25:50.611
- That guy?
- No...

25:50.641 --> 25:51.640
Dead.

25:52.195 --> 25:53.195
No.

25:54.311 --> 25:55.333
Listen to me.

25:55.363 --> 25:56.779
It's done. It's over.

25:56.781 --> 25:58.580
You don't understand.

25:58.582 --> 26:00.699
He drank the serum.

26:02.119 --> 26:04.036
He wanted you to kill him.

26:04.038 --> 26:06.956
You helped him take the final step.

26:26.496 --> 26:28.533
Poor show, poor show. Come on, gents.

26:28.563 --> 26:31.113
You can do better, surely.

26:31.115 --> 26:32.481
What do you think, Elijah?

26:32.483 --> 26:34.783
This new power, it suits me, no?

26:34.785 --> 26:36.852
I've pondered this...

26:36.854 --> 26:38.821
whom to end first:

26:38.823 --> 26:40.322
You or Klaus?

26:40.527 --> 26:42.647
I had thought him.

26:42.677 --> 26:43.793
But now that I'm here,

26:43.795 --> 26:46.011
I think it should be you.

27:03.440 --> 27:05.815
A barrier spell.

27:05.817 --> 27:07.983
How delicious.

27:10.454 --> 27:13.322
I do appreciate a bit of spice
being thrown into the hunt.

27:13.324 --> 27:15.726
It's not very fun if the
quarry just rolls over

27:15.756 --> 27:17.409
and offers its neck, is it?

27:17.411 --> 27:20.212
I can keep this up as long as I need to.

27:23.417 --> 27:25.718
I don't doubt it, you little minx.

27:26.838 --> 27:28.170
Never mind.

27:28.172 --> 27:30.407
I have waited a thousand years.

27:30.437 --> 27:32.174
I can wait a tad longer.

27:32.176 --> 27:33.475
I'm gonna enjoy

27:33.477 --> 27:37.179
making this last a long time.

27:58.174 --> 27:59.924
Well, at least your sister's safe.

27:59.926 --> 28:02.276
And the man that pretended
to be a family friend,

28:02.278 --> 28:04.428
but actually hated us for an eternity,

28:04.430 --> 28:06.230
has turned himself into some creature.

28:06.232 --> 28:08.732
Here which, for all we know,
could be the bloody beast

28:08.734 --> 28:11.435
the prophecy said would end us!

28:14.421 --> 28:15.439
Hey...

28:15.441 --> 28:17.224
All of this?

28:17.226 --> 28:18.606
I don't think it has anything

28:18.636 --> 28:20.811
to do with you being a vampire.

28:21.420 --> 28:23.063
Cami said it might be magic-related.

28:23.065 --> 28:24.865
And I think she's right.

28:24.867 --> 28:26.400
Kol, you're not yourself.

28:26.402 --> 28:27.448
Not myself?

28:27.478 --> 28:29.453
And which self am I supposed to be?

28:29.855 --> 28:31.471
I have been a witch,

28:31.473 --> 28:32.912
a vampire,

28:32.942 --> 28:35.325
a ghost, a witch in
somebody else's body.

28:35.327 --> 28:36.526
And now,

28:36.528 --> 28:38.946
I am a bloody vampire again.

28:38.948 --> 28:40.686
Now, you think that I'm cursed.

28:40.716 --> 28:42.266
But I think it's everybody else

28:42.268 --> 28:43.884
getting into my bloody business

28:43.886 --> 28:46.053
and not knowing when to back off.

29:17.220 --> 29:18.419
Freya's safe.

29:18.421 --> 29:19.920
What about the others?

29:20.539 --> 29:21.639
Well, Finn's in a bad way.

29:21.641 --> 29:24.091
Some kind of werewolf bite.

29:24.093 --> 29:26.310
Elijah thinks I should
return home and heal him.

29:26.312 --> 29:27.595
Ease his pain.

29:27.597 --> 29:29.013
Klaus, you should go.

29:30.030 --> 29:31.400
As soon as these last few recover,

29:31.430 --> 29:33.767
I'll get them home,
gather what I can and

29:33.769 --> 29:35.936
torch this place.

29:36.435 --> 29:37.938
No.

29:37.940 --> 29:39.773
Finn can purge it himself.

29:39.775 --> 29:40.941
He's earned the agony.

29:40.943 --> 29:42.243
Besides, you know how much

29:42.245 --> 29:44.232
I love burning things to the ground.

29:44.262 --> 29:46.447
Klaus, when you said that you wanted

29:46.449 --> 29:47.865
to work together for Hope's sake,

29:47.867 --> 29:50.250
I wanted to see what that looked like.

29:50.280 --> 29:51.594
And now I do.

29:52.060 --> 29:53.003
I appreciate

29:53.005 --> 29:54.622
you helping me rescue the wolves,

29:54.624 --> 29:56.624
but if there is any chance
of making Finn an ally,

29:56.626 --> 29:58.292
you should take it.

30:00.680 --> 30:01.962
Go.

30:07.136 --> 30:09.320
Don't leave me in here!

30:09.471 --> 30:10.687
Don't leave me alone!

30:10.689 --> 30:12.021
- Put him down.
- Hey, hey, hey,

30:12.023 --> 30:13.812
you're not alone, Finn.

30:13.842 --> 30:15.709
I'm here.

30:15.711 --> 30:17.032
Don't leave...

30:17.062 --> 30:18.228
Why is he talking like this?

30:18.230 --> 30:20.151
It's hallucinations of our betrayal.

30:20.181 --> 30:21.899
It's his nightmare.

30:23.853 --> 30:25.554
Well, he looks

30:26.414 --> 30:27.771
awful.

30:27.773 --> 30:29.295
Werewolf bite.

30:29.325 --> 30:31.241
That's got to hurt, mate.

30:31.861 --> 30:33.661
So, Lucien's a bloody hybrid.

30:33.663 --> 30:35.045
We don't know what he is.

30:35.047 --> 30:37.047
His venom seems to work twice as fast.

30:37.412 --> 30:38.666
That's good.

30:38.668 --> 30:40.884
Maybe it'll work through
his system twice as fast.

30:40.886 --> 30:43.220
Or it's twice as lethal.

30:43.222 --> 30:45.117
Now, if Niklaus doesn't
get here in time,

30:45.147 --> 30:46.173
he might die.

30:46.175 --> 30:48.150
With a bit of luck.

30:48.611 --> 30:49.577
What is wrong with you?

30:49.579 --> 30:50.828
Behave yourselves!

30:51.230 --> 30:52.285
Both of you.

30:52.315 --> 30:53.531
Sibling squabbling.

30:53.533 --> 30:55.347
How familiar.

30:55.377 --> 30:57.151
Although the teams seem to have changed.

30:57.908 --> 30:59.520
Someone care to tell me why?

30:59.522 --> 31:00.904
Our brother needs us.

31:23.360 --> 31:24.661
Go outside and tell the others

31:24.663 --> 31:26.780
to keep their eyes peeled for trouble.

31:26.782 --> 31:28.448
As soon as this place burns,

31:28.450 --> 31:29.807
I'll take you back to the Crescents.

31:29.837 --> 31:31.501
I'm not from there.

31:31.503 --> 31:32.858
One was.

31:32.888 --> 31:34.722
He died last week.

31:35.753 --> 31:38.108
We're from the seven packs:

31:38.560 --> 31:41.445
Deep Water, Malraux, BasRoq,

31:41.447 --> 31:43.113
Barry, Poldark...

31:44.650 --> 31:46.784
I'm a Paxon.

31:48.116 --> 31:49.403
Wow.

31:49.969 --> 31:52.239
He had to look long and
hard to find one of you.

31:52.241 --> 31:54.825
They wanted our venom.

31:58.998 --> 32:00.414
They kept...

32:00.416 --> 32:03.250
pumping it into her over
and over and over again.

32:03.252 --> 32:05.419
Then they'd heal her with some drug.

32:08.289 --> 32:10.307
Except the last time.

32:14.397 --> 32:17.097
They shot her up with
something so powerful...

32:18.934 --> 32:21.151
there was no saving her.

32:26.442 --> 32:27.882
Go.

32:28.611 --> 32:30.994
I'm gonna burn this hell hole.

32:53.085 --> 32:54.468
Thank you, brother.

32:55.087 --> 32:56.303
How are you feeling?

32:56.838 --> 32:58.639
I feel...

32:58.921 --> 33:00.441
strangely euphoric.

33:00.443 --> 33:03.026
I've been known to have that effect.

33:08.176 --> 33:09.650
What a precious family moment.

33:10.162 --> 33:13.487
Pardon me, while I go and gouge
out my eyes with a hot poker.

33:15.875 --> 33:17.630
I thank even you, Kol.

33:18.380 --> 33:20.544
Your little witch actually came through.

33:22.397 --> 33:23.780
Today...

33:25.300 --> 33:26.335
I saw a glimpse

33:26.365 --> 33:30.303
of your coveted Always and Forever.

33:32.940 --> 33:35.808
And... I...

33:36.318 --> 33:38.444
Finn! Finn!

33:38.446 --> 33:40.163
- Oh, what's happening?!
- What's happening?

33:47.348 --> 33:48.464
What's wrong with him?

33:48.466 --> 33:50.382
His body, it's dying.

33:51.184 --> 33:53.268
No, no, it's not possible!

33:53.270 --> 33:54.986
I cured him!

33:54.988 --> 33:56.158
Freya...!

33:56.188 --> 33:58.312
Hey, it's going to
be all right, brother.

33:59.593 --> 34:00.843
We'll fix this, you'll see.

34:00.845 --> 34:02.845
Okay? Get my pendant.

34:03.514 --> 34:04.813
It won't work!

34:04.815 --> 34:06.877
Davina fused his soul to his body.

34:06.907 --> 34:08.400
We've got to try.

34:08.402 --> 34:10.985
There's no Other Side, no
Ancestral well if he dies.

34:10.987 --> 34:12.987
No, get your bloody girlfriend back here

34:12.989 --> 34:14.989
to undo what she's done. Finn, you will

34:14.992 --> 34:17.275
drink from the source
until Freya can move you.

34:17.277 --> 34:18.610
No.

34:24.770 --> 34:27.418
Don't leave me alone.

34:27.867 --> 34:29.340
Brother?

34:30.174 --> 34:31.422
Finn?

34:31.425 --> 34:33.375
Hey, brother, we're here.

34:33.377 --> 34:34.793
We are here.

34:39.473 --> 34:40.855
I'm here, brother.

34:41.377 --> 34:43.051
Please...

34:44.271 --> 34:46.221
You are not alone.

34:46.223 --> 34:47.773
I am here.

34:48.443 --> 34:50.641
I am here.

34:51.661 --> 34:53.277
I am with you.

34:53.280 --> 34:54.612
Okay?

34:54.614 --> 34:55.947
I'm with you.

35:23.928 --> 35:24.928
Oh, no...

35:29.433 --> 35:31.683
Oh, damn...

36:05.813 --> 36:09.054
You fought against what time
and circumstance made you.

36:14.194 --> 36:15.944
You're free now, Finn.

36:26.356 --> 36:28.156
I loathed you for centuries.

36:29.184 --> 36:31.043
Even now, it remains unabated.

36:36.983 --> 36:39.517
But I know torment, brother.

36:39.519 --> 36:44.405
So I hope you somehow
find peace in the abyss.

36:52.010 --> 36:54.755
When you were born,

36:54.785 --> 36:56.819
you gave me a gift.

36:58.205 --> 37:01.073
You were my first friend.

37:03.994 --> 37:05.544
Today you gifted me

37:06.070 --> 37:07.542
my life...

37:09.205 --> 37:10.415
and my brothers

37:10.894 --> 37:11.894
united.

37:13.721 --> 37:16.505
Even if for a moment.

37:19.375 --> 37:20.741
I love you.

37:24.364 --> 37:27.815
Always and forever, brother.

37:27.817 --> 37:30.652
Till forever ends.

37:42.165 --> 37:43.539
Just know...

37:44.968 --> 37:47.885
that you will be avenged.

38:05.250 --> 38:06.600
Got your message.

38:08.191 --> 38:10.191
I don't know what's more surprising...

38:10.193 --> 38:13.077
you saving my ass today or
wanting to see me afterwards.

38:14.864 --> 38:16.948
I need your help.

38:18.785 --> 38:20.651
Davina, I don't know if I'm your guy.

38:20.653 --> 38:21.708
Outside these walls,

38:21.738 --> 38:24.189
the Ancestors have a,
uh, a pretty strong say

38:24.191 --> 38:26.274
in what I can and cannot do.

38:26.919 --> 38:28.860
They're manipulating Kol, too.

38:28.862 --> 38:30.390
Yeah.

38:30.420 --> 38:32.330
I tested his blood.

38:32.332 --> 38:34.032
It's infused with their magic,

38:34.034 --> 38:35.450
which means they corrupted the spell

38:35.452 --> 38:36.952
I used to bring him back.

38:39.289 --> 38:40.622
They couldn't get to me,

38:40.624 --> 38:43.708
so they're making him lose control.

38:44.798 --> 38:47.212
I don't know what to do.

38:48.599 --> 38:50.298
Oh.

38:50.300 --> 38:52.467
Davina Claire.

38:55.639 --> 38:58.056
You know, I used to respect them.

38:58.058 --> 39:00.775
The Ancestors, I mean...

39:00.777 --> 39:02.277
The more and more I watched them,

39:02.279 --> 39:05.480
the more I saw them just using people

39:05.482 --> 39:07.149
for their own needs.

39:07.151 --> 39:09.568
Then when they're done, they just...

39:09.570 --> 39:11.319
toss them aside.

39:11.321 --> 39:13.572
Like they're trash.

39:13.574 --> 39:15.991
And if you disobey 'em... whoa, right?

39:15.993 --> 39:18.210
If we disobey 'em, then
they're gonna shun us.

39:18.212 --> 39:20.412
If we disobey them,

39:20.414 --> 39:22.164
then they're gonna cripple us!

39:22.166 --> 39:23.832
They're gonna kill us!

39:23.834 --> 39:26.974
They've got to be stopped, Davina.

39:27.776 --> 39:30.839
They've got to be stopped.

39:32.676 --> 39:36.011
And it looks like it's just
gonna be on us to do it.

39:55.749 --> 39:58.200
Lucien did all of this
to become like his maker,

39:58.202 --> 40:01.870
and yet my bite cannot kill an Original.

40:02.677 --> 40:04.839
What are we up against here, brother?

40:05.688 --> 40:07.542
I truly don't know.

40:08.779 --> 40:10.378
I might.

40:10.380 --> 40:14.382
Klaus and I found Lucien's
R&D lab full of werewolves.

40:15.769 --> 40:18.553
He is harvesting venom,
but not to find a cure.

40:18.555 --> 40:21.473
He's trying to create
a more lethal strain.

40:21.475 --> 40:23.058
Well, that must be what
he added to the spell

40:23.060 --> 40:24.859
to make him whatever the hell he is now.

40:24.861 --> 40:27.145
He kept boasting about having something

40:27.147 --> 40:28.703
that would make him
better than an Original.

40:28.733 --> 40:30.015
Klaus is descended from one of

40:30.017 --> 40:31.689
the seven original wolf bloodlines.

40:31.719 --> 40:33.582
I am descended from another.

40:33.612 --> 40:35.306
Lucien's venom...

40:35.336 --> 40:37.472
is derived from all seven packs.

40:38.739 --> 40:42.048
Giving him a bite that
not even I can cure.

40:42.078 --> 40:44.612
There were two vials of
serum and he only drank one.

40:44.614 --> 40:47.315
Maybe it's because the spell
will wear off eventually

40:47.317 --> 40:49.133
and he'll need another dose.

40:49.163 --> 40:51.152
Or he made enough for two.

40:57.410 --> 40:59.327
Aurora.

41:15.178 --> 41:16.678
She's gone.
