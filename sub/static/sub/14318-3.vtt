00:01.708 --> 00:03.000
[narrator]
Previously on X-Men...

00:03.000 --> 00:04.625
Why are you
doing this to me?

00:04.625 --> 00:05.708
I haven't done anything.

00:05.708 --> 00:07.250
You can help us identify

00:07.250 --> 00:09.166
the most dangerous mutants
of all.

00:09.166 --> 00:10.500
[Morph] That's the last
of the mutant files.

00:11.291 --> 00:13.625
[Gyrich] Who are these
so-called X-Men?

00:14.833 --> 00:16.583
Wolverine! Pull back!

00:17.250 --> 00:18.375
What's wrong, Jean?

00:18.375 --> 00:19.375
[Jean] It's Morph.

00:20.375 --> 00:22.333
Cyclops, we are
being overwhelmed.

00:24.250 --> 00:25.583
[guard] Hold it right there!

00:25.583 --> 00:27.833
This attack was foiled

00:27.833 --> 00:31.708
with the help
of experimental robot policemen
called Sentinels.

00:31.708 --> 00:33.458
Sentinels.

00:33.458 --> 00:36.708
How would you like to locate
the Sentinels' home base?

00:36.708 --> 00:38.208
Surrender, mutant.

00:38.625 --> 00:39.708
Not!

00:41.000 --> 00:43.208
Returning to base for repairs.

00:45.125 --> 00:46.125
You miss me, petite?

00:49.000 --> 00:50.708
[Cyclops] Is that all of them?

00:50.708 --> 00:52.208
Ain't that enough?

00:52.708 --> 00:56.833
I'll avenge you, my friend.
I swear it!

00:58.625 --> 00:59.708
[theme music playing]

02:17.708 --> 02:20.291
Well, get a load of that!

02:20.291 --> 02:22.625
A mutant trying to read!

02:23.583 --> 02:25.458
No, Look at the title.

02:25.458 --> 02:29.208
Animal Farm.
He's just looking
at the pictures.

02:29.208 --> 02:32.583
See any of your relatives
in there, hairball?

02:32.583 --> 02:35.208
[both laugh]

02:35.375 --> 02:37.416
Hey! What the heck is that?

02:43.583 --> 02:44.583
Don't try anything!

02:49.416 --> 02:51.375
Stay put!
Don't take your eyes off him!

02:51.583 --> 02:54.208
Hey! Oh, why me?

03:05.291 --> 03:07.083
Make them stop!

03:07.083 --> 03:08.416
You go to the window

03:08.416 --> 03:10.583
and call off
your freak friends!

03:11.083 --> 03:13.166
Do it, or so help me...

03:14.083 --> 03:15.458
[sighs]

03:15.458 --> 03:18.833
Wolverine. So impulsive.

03:25.750 --> 03:29.458
Sergeant! Wait! Sergeant!

03:36.166 --> 03:37.583
[coughing]

03:50.416 --> 03:51.875
I don't believe we've met.

03:57.291 --> 03:59.000
Magneto, I presume.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.750
Come! We must hurry!

04:01.958 --> 04:03.708
Your solicitude is appreciated,

04:03.708 --> 04:04.958
I assure you.

04:04.958 --> 04:06.416
I regret, however, that--

04:06.416 --> 04:08.125
What are you waiting for?

04:08.125 --> 04:10.291
My day in court, actually.

04:11.458 --> 04:12.833
Professor Xavier and I feel--

04:12.833 --> 04:14.875
Xavier?

04:14.875 --> 04:18.458
Charles Xavier
had you break into
the Mutant Control Agency?

04:18.458 --> 04:20.875
Reluctantly, I assure you.

04:20.875 --> 04:23.458
And he would leave you
to rot in prison?

04:23.458 --> 04:25.291
Not at all.

04:25.291 --> 04:27.875
My trial serves a purpose.

04:27.875 --> 04:31.750
It shall prove my innocence
and the righteousness
of our cause.

04:31.750 --> 04:34.000
[Magneto] What chance
does a mutant have,

04:34.000 --> 04:36.750
tried by normal humans?

04:36.750 --> 04:38.833
[guard 1] Cover that hole
with fire. Don't let them out!

04:43.500 --> 04:46.208
Are these the people
whose laws you trust?

04:46.708 --> 04:49.750
They don't seem to share
your sense of brotherhood.

04:50.333 --> 04:53.208
They only fight
because they fear us.

04:53.208 --> 04:55.166
Because they
don't yet understand.

04:55.166 --> 04:57.375
They do understand.

04:57.375 --> 04:59.958
Our mutant powers
make us superior.

05:00.083 --> 05:01.958
That is why they fear us.

05:01.958 --> 05:04.000
[Beast]
That is why I must stand trial.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.291
They must see that we are not
a threat to mankind,

05:07.291 --> 05:08.458
but are a part of it.

05:08.458 --> 05:09.708
[guard 2] Let's go! Come on!

05:13.291 --> 05:15.500
The humans must be crushed,

05:15.500 --> 05:18.583
and I have the power to do it.

05:57.583 --> 05:59.458
Huh? Ah!

06:04.875 --> 06:06.583
[Jubilee] Hey! Hot graphics!

06:06.583 --> 06:08.458
[Xavier]
It's a tape of tonight's news

06:08.458 --> 06:10.500
about
the detention center attack.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.750
Oh. Who's the guy?

06:13.333 --> 06:15.375
[Xavier] He was once a friend.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.083
-[Jubilee] Was?
-We met after a war.

06:18.583 --> 06:20.416
I worked in a hospital,

06:20.416 --> 06:23.625
secretly using my mental powers
to heal the survivors.

06:23.625 --> 06:26.583
A dedicated young aide
named Magnus assisted me.

06:26.583 --> 06:30.083
Together, we helped patients
rediscover the joy of life.

06:30.083 --> 06:31.583
We became friends.

06:31.583 --> 06:34.875
But for some,
a war is never over.

06:34.875 --> 06:37.000
Remnants of the army

06:37.000 --> 06:40.166
that had so brutally occupied
his small country returned,

06:40.166 --> 06:41.750
attempting to retake it.

06:44.208 --> 06:47.000
We saved
what patients we could,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.125
revealing for the first time

06:49.125 --> 06:51.625
to each other, to anyone,

06:51.625 --> 06:54.708
our long-hidden mutant powers.

06:54.708 --> 06:57.083
But Magnus wasn't through.

06:57.083 --> 07:00.208
He'd lost his family
when those people
overran his country.

07:00.208 --> 07:03.333
Consumed by rage,
he tried to destroy them.

07:03.333 --> 07:07.708
I stopped him.
But I'd never seen
such a change in a man.

07:08.333 --> 07:10.833
I tried to help him
deal with his pain.

07:11.125 --> 07:13.875
Magnus, your violence
will solve nothing.

07:13.875 --> 07:18.083
We must use our special gifts
to bring peace to mankind!

07:18.083 --> 07:21.708
You're a fool, Charles.
Look at them!

07:22.291 --> 07:25.125
They can't even make peace
with each other.

07:26.083 --> 07:28.875
[Xavier] Heaven help us
if he was right.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Possessing the power
of magnetism,

07:32.000 --> 07:34.750
he began calling himself
Magneto.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.250
He and his growing legion
of followers

07:37.250 --> 07:40.583
attacked power plants,
factories,
government buildings,

07:40.583 --> 07:43.333
determined to disrupt
human society,

07:43.333 --> 07:46.083
paving the way
for mutant takeover.

07:48.375 --> 07:49.458
[Jubilee] But you stopped him.

07:53.166 --> 07:54.750
[Xavier] I did what I could.

07:56.083 --> 08:00.291
But now, after all these years,
it seems he's begun again.

08:00.291 --> 08:02.458
But the X-Men
are here now, Professor.

08:04.833 --> 08:06.333
He can't fight all of us.

08:10.583 --> 08:11.625
[crowd clamoring]

08:11.625 --> 08:12.708
[woman] Get out of here!

08:12.708 --> 08:14.083
We don't want you here!

08:14.083 --> 08:15.625
[man] Down with mutants!

08:15.625 --> 08:18.291
Order! Order, I say!

08:20.708 --> 08:22.125
-[clamoring stops]
-[clears throat]

08:22.125 --> 08:23.250
That's better.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.291
[all grumbling]

08:27.000 --> 08:29.333
It doesn't look like
it's gonna be Beast's day.

08:29.333 --> 08:32.958
Your Honor,
because of the severity
of this defendant's crime

08:32.958 --> 08:36.125
and his demonstrated
danger to the community,

08:36.125 --> 08:38.333
the people move to deny bail.

08:38.333 --> 08:41.250
Your Honor,
my client is charged
with a simple felony.

08:41.250 --> 08:43.750
You're denying him bail
just because he's a mutant.

08:43.750 --> 08:48.333
Now, Mr. Hodge,
you know this court
harbors no prejudice.

08:48.333 --> 08:52.208
Any insinuation to the contrary
will not be tolerated.

08:52.208 --> 08:53.208
Your Honor?

08:53.208 --> 08:55.375
Yes, Mr. McCoy?

08:55.375 --> 08:59.416
May I address the court
on the subject of
mitigating circumstances?

08:59.875 --> 09:02.000
Certainly, Mr. McCoy.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.875
I wouldn't want anyone to think
we weren't being fair.

09:06.458 --> 09:07.750
Thank you, Your Honor.

09:08.166 --> 09:12.000
Your Honor, we mutants yearn
only to live in peace

09:12.000 --> 09:13.625
with our human brothers.

09:14.083 --> 09:17.291
To paraphrase the Bard,
"I am a mutant.

09:17.708 --> 09:20.500
Hath not a mutant
senses, affections,

09:20.500 --> 09:22.833
fed with the same food,

09:22.833 --> 09:26.416
warmed and cooled
by the same winter and summer
as a human is?

09:27.208 --> 09:30.208
If you prick us,
do we not bleed?"

09:30.208 --> 09:33.208
Don't tempt these
people, Mr. McCoy.

09:33.208 --> 09:35.125
Please get to the point.

09:35.125 --> 09:36.291
Certainly.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.708
Two days before the...

09:39.250 --> 09:41.875
incident in the Mutant
Registration Office,

09:41.875 --> 09:45.083
eleven mutants disappeared,
taken...

09:45.083 --> 09:48.000
Your Honor, what possible
relevance could this have

09:48.000 --> 09:50.416
to Mr. McCoy's
criminal activities?

09:50.875 --> 09:54.875
All were recent registrants
with the Mutant Control Agency.

09:54.875 --> 09:59.583
Your Honor, the defendant is
attempting to justify his crime

09:59.583 --> 10:02.875
by attacking a program
set up to help mutants.

10:03.458 --> 10:05.416
[crowd shouting]

10:07.583 --> 10:09.000
What about the mutant attack

10:09.000 --> 10:10.458
on the detention center
last night?

10:10.458 --> 10:12.291
My brother was
one of those guards!

10:12.291 --> 10:15.000
Bailiffs, remove that man!

10:15.000 --> 10:17.083
[handcuffs click]

10:18.333 --> 10:19.708
[man] A lot of good men
were hurt!

10:19.708 --> 10:22.291
Is that your idea
of helping mankind?

10:22.291 --> 10:25.458
Quiet, quiet, I say!

10:26.875 --> 10:28.291
-[silence]
-Now...

10:28.625 --> 10:32.375
in view of the violence
of both the original offense

10:32.375 --> 10:34.750
and last night's
attempted escape,

10:35.291 --> 10:38.583
the court feels
this defendant would pose

10:38.583 --> 10:41.583
a danger to the community,
if released.

10:41.583 --> 10:42.708
But, Your Honor...

10:43.333 --> 10:45.125
Bail denied.

10:48.333 --> 10:49.625
[sighs]

10:50.208 --> 10:53.750
Looks like I'll have time
to catch up on my Dostoyevsky.

10:53.750 --> 10:55.375
[cheering]

10:56.250 --> 10:58.583
I'll show him a danger
to the community!

10:59.166 --> 11:00.875
No!

11:02.458 --> 11:03.875
No! That's an order!

11:04.375 --> 11:05.708
Out of my way!

11:06.333 --> 11:07.500
[crashing]

11:07.500 --> 11:08.875
[people screaming]

11:09.708 --> 11:11.250
[Wolverine] Sabretooth!

11:13.458 --> 11:15.083
You know that lunatic?

11:15.083 --> 11:16.125
[yelling]

11:18.708 --> 11:20.416
[Sabretooth] Let him go!

11:25.000 --> 11:26.583
Come on!
They're gonna kill him!

11:27.250 --> 11:28.250
Good.

11:29.166 --> 11:30.166
What?

11:33.625 --> 11:34.750
Fine!

11:41.708 --> 11:46.291
[Xavier, telepathically]
Where are you?
I know you're close.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.583
-Professor?
-Professor Xavier?

11:51.708 --> 11:53.708
Charles? Are you all right?

11:53.708 --> 11:56.500
I'm fine, Storm. Really.

11:57.125 --> 11:59.250
You're looking
for that Magneto guy.

11:59.250 --> 12:01.000
You've been here all night.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.583
Who is this Magneto, Professor?

12:04.375 --> 12:05.708
[alarm blaring]

12:05.708 --> 12:07.000
[Cyclops on PA] Emergency!

12:07.000 --> 12:08.291
Prepare infirmary to receive

12:08.291 --> 12:09.500
critically injured mutant!

12:09.500 --> 12:10.500
[gasps]

12:13.083 --> 12:14.625
[Cyclops] Everything happened
so fast.

12:14.625 --> 12:16.166
One minute, the judge
denied Beast's bail.

12:16.166 --> 12:18.833
Then this strange mutant
just went berserk.

12:19.416 --> 12:21.000
Is he gonna be OK, Professor?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
He seems to have stabilized.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.500
I'm glad.

12:26.583 --> 12:29.333
Something about him
reminds me of Wolverine.

12:29.333 --> 12:32.000
His name's Sabretooth.
Wolverine knows him

12:32.708 --> 12:33.833
and hates him.

12:33.833 --> 12:35.083
Did he give a reason?

12:35.083 --> 12:36.583
Does he ever?

12:36.583 --> 12:39.083
There he is.
Why don't you ask him?

12:41.958 --> 12:43.208
[sniffs]

12:44.125 --> 12:45.500
Here we are.

12:58.583 --> 13:01.083
If it weren't for Xavier...

13:01.083 --> 13:02.333
[Cyclops] Wolverine!

13:02.333 --> 13:05.625
Back off. Slow and easy.

13:05.625 --> 13:08.291
I'm taking this
maggot out of here,

13:08.291 --> 13:10.625
one way or the other.

13:10.625 --> 13:14.000
Uh, maybe we should move him
somewhere else.

13:14.625 --> 13:18.583
Wolverine! Personal vendettas
have no place here.

13:18.583 --> 13:21.291
You know we must help a mutant
if he's in trouble.

13:21.291 --> 13:24.625
It's not personal.
He's a threat.

13:24.625 --> 13:25.875
He was near death.

13:26.500 --> 13:27.875
[Wolverine] Not near enough.

13:27.875 --> 13:28.958
[Xavier] Wolverine!

13:28.958 --> 13:30.458
Now, get out of my way.

13:30.458 --> 13:33.291
If you take Sabretooth
from this infirmary,

13:33.291 --> 13:35.458
don't bother coming back.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.750
But you don't know him.

13:39.750 --> 13:41.958
He can't stay here.

13:41.958 --> 13:45.291
That is the way some of us
felt about you
when you first came.

13:45.750 --> 13:49.000
This man's rages
seem much like your own.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.125
Get out of my way.

13:50.416 --> 13:52.000
[computer] Sector 37!

13:52.000 --> 13:52.958
-Magneto!
-[computer] Missile base alert!

13:52.958 --> 13:54.291
How can you be sure?

13:54.458 --> 13:57.375
I know him. Hurry!
All else must wait.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.250
-[Jubilee] Hey! Wait up!
-No, Jubilee! Not yet.

14:00.250 --> 14:01.583
Magneto is too dangerous.

14:01.583 --> 14:03.708
But, Professor Xavier...

14:03.708 --> 14:05.583
Besides, Sabretooth
needs our help.

14:14.250 --> 14:17.291
How come we're supposed
to trash your old enemy,

14:18.125 --> 14:21.000
but we got to go easy on mine?

14:27.625 --> 14:30.291
[Magneto] You dare oppose me?

14:31.000 --> 14:34.833
Your most powerful weapons
shall destroy you,

14:34.833 --> 14:38.375
and mutants will hide in fear
no more.

14:41.583 --> 14:43.000
[guard] Stop that thing!

14:43.000 --> 14:44.583
He's heading
for Launch Control!

14:47.291 --> 14:50.958
[Magneto]
Mutant liberation begins.

14:54.250 --> 14:57.125
[computer]
Initiation of launch sequence
acknowledged.

14:57.125 --> 14:58.708
Hey, what the--

14:58.708 --> 15:01.000
[computer] Launch
at T minus three minutes.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.083
These things
have armed themselves!

15:07.958 --> 15:10.208
Computer override!
Abort launch procedure!

15:12.375 --> 15:14.458
-How much longer?
-A few seconds!

15:14.458 --> 15:15.458
[beeps]

15:15.458 --> 15:17.208
It can't be!

15:17.208 --> 15:19.208
Those missiles
are targeted at us!

15:35.125 --> 15:36.625
[technician] That's got it.

15:36.625 --> 15:38.750
[computer] Launch
at T minus two minutes,

15:38.750 --> 15:39.875
thirty seconds.

15:39.875 --> 15:41.416
[technician] It didn't work!

15:41.416 --> 15:42.708
Something's maintaining
the circuits!

15:42.708 --> 15:44.333
[Lieutenant] Everybody out!
Move it!

15:46.708 --> 15:50.125
[PA system] This is a code red
emergency! Abandon base!

15:50.458 --> 15:53.250
Repeat!
Code red emergency!

15:53.250 --> 15:54.625
Abandon base!

15:57.583 --> 15:59.416
I see no one.

15:59.416 --> 16:00.458
[sniffs]

16:01.000 --> 16:02.250
He was here.

16:02.250 --> 16:04.458
I can still smell him.

16:04.458 --> 16:09.458
[Magneto]
"O what a brave new world
that has such people in it!"

16:09.458 --> 16:10.708
[Cyclops] Magneto!

16:10.708 --> 16:12.833
I'm glad
you decided to join me

16:12.833 --> 16:14.958
in the liberation
of mutantkind.

16:14.958 --> 16:17.500
Today begins a new world
for all of us!

16:17.500 --> 16:22.208
A world where we needn't hide
in corners and crawl in fear.

16:22.208 --> 16:25.291
I don't know what corner
you crawled out of, bub,

16:25.291 --> 16:29.166
but we don't find nuclear
missiles all that liberating.

16:30.125 --> 16:32.750
Come quietly or be taken.

16:32.750 --> 16:35.416
And I hope
you want to be taken.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.291
This is your last warning.

16:43.708 --> 16:46.458
I had hoped
that Xavier would have realized

16:46.458 --> 16:48.000
that his childish quest

16:48.000 --> 16:51.958
for peaceful coexistence
with humans is hopeless.

16:51.958 --> 16:55.416
I suppose that a civil war
is your answer?

16:55.416 --> 16:59.125
Better that we die on our feet
than live on our knees.

17:01.083 --> 17:02.708
[Storm] I cannot move!

17:02.708 --> 17:05.708
[Magneto] Tell Xavier
I am stronger now.

17:05.708 --> 17:07.958
As I healed
from our last encounter,

17:07.958 --> 17:10.000
I had time to prepare.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.208
Tell him those who oppose me
are traitors to mutantkind.

17:14.208 --> 17:16.708
I will show him no mercy.

17:17.458 --> 17:19.083
[Storm grunts]

17:19.083 --> 17:21.416
[Magneto] If Charles Xavier
dreams of peace

17:21.416 --> 17:23.333
between human and mutant,

17:23.333 --> 17:26.458
his vision will soon
become a nightmare.

17:32.583 --> 17:36.708
Wolverine. Storm.
Are you all right?

17:37.458 --> 17:39.583
Like new.

17:39.583 --> 17:42.708
Nothing is broken.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.583
-The silos!
-They are starting to launch!

17:47.583 --> 17:49.000
Not if I can help it.

17:54.375 --> 17:55.416
[beeping]

18:01.250 --> 18:03.708
Where's the blasted switch?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Cyclops!

18:09.375 --> 18:10.375
No!

18:12.416 --> 18:14.875
Professor! What is it?

18:14.875 --> 18:19.375
I was wrong!
I should have stopped him
when I had the chance!

18:26.708 --> 18:30.708
No, Cyclops,
using your optic-blast
would detonate the warheads.

18:31.250 --> 18:32.625
Better here than over a city.

18:33.083 --> 18:35.208
Got any other ideas?

18:37.291 --> 18:40.208
Yes. I know what I must do.

18:41.833 --> 18:44.750
[Cyclops]
Storm! Wait! Don't do it!

18:44.750 --> 18:47.083
Is Storm doing
what I think she's doing?

18:47.083 --> 18:49.208
She's going to blow up
those missiles herself!

18:50.166 --> 18:53.083
Storm, Storm! Answer me!

18:53.083 --> 18:55.208
Not now.

18:55.208 --> 18:58.500
[Xavier, telepathically]
Storm, I sense
your plan of action,

18:58.500 --> 19:01.625
but there is no need
for self-sacrifice.

19:01.625 --> 19:03.958
Professor, I must.

19:03.958 --> 19:05.750
Open your mind.

19:06.166 --> 19:10.208
Absorb what Cerebro knows
about the missiles' computers.

19:10.750 --> 19:14.125
Yes. I understand now.

19:31.208 --> 19:33.958
I sure hope
she's got this worked out.

19:34.375 --> 19:36.500
[Storm grunts]

19:40.708 --> 19:42.833
Now, the warheads.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.583
Control systems.

19:47.250 --> 19:50.750
[weakly] Short-circuited.
Warheads disarmed.

19:52.958 --> 19:56.333
[Cyclops, on radio]
Good work, Storm. Storm?

19:56.333 --> 19:57.583
Wolverine!

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
[Wolverine] I'm on it!

20:03.708 --> 20:05.291
[Wolverine sighs]

20:08.500 --> 20:12.083
Wolverine! [panting] Is she...

20:12.416 --> 20:14.458
Must be our company, Cyclops.

20:14.833 --> 20:17.833
She's asleep. She's exhausted.

20:18.125 --> 20:19.458
Mission accomplished, buddy.

20:19.458 --> 20:22.583
OK. Let's go home.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.208
[Magneto] You've trained
your X-Men well, Xavier.

20:32.208 --> 20:34.875
They defied me
and delayed my war.

20:34.875 --> 20:37.833
You and your mutants
protect the humans

20:37.833 --> 20:39.458
who seek to destroy us.

20:39.875 --> 20:44.750
Why? Why have you turned
against your own kind?

20:48.208 --> 20:49.250
[theme music playing]
