WEBVTT

00:01.416 --> 00:03.212
Why are you wearing an
Omega Chi pledge pin?

00:03.213 --> 00:04.514
Because I'm pledging Omega Chi.

00:04.515 --> 00:06.301
If it's OK with you, I
might just skip tonight.

00:06.302 --> 00:07.485
- Do you mind? 
- I totally get it.

00:07.486 --> 00:08.918
Will you be my date for Pledge Presents?

00:08.919 --> 00:09.899
What about your boyfriend?

00:09.900 --> 00:11.761
He can't be bothered with a sorority party.

00:11.762 --> 00:13.568
Not when there's a law
school study group to go to.

00:13.570 --> 00:15.696
Please teach me about
fairy tales and reality.

00:15.697 --> 00:17.729
- What is that supposed to mean?
- One word: Cappie.

00:17.730 --> 00:20.614
How much time are you gonna waste
on that stupid fairy tale?

00:20.615 --> 00:21.477
For someone who wants me gone,

00:21.478 --> 00:22.795
you could at least get out of my way.

00:22.796 --> 00:23.654
Where are you headed?

00:23.655 --> 00:25.669
I'm staying at Rusty's
until I find my own place.

00:27.229 --> 00:29.030
- What is this? 
- It's a fairy tale.

00:30.793 --> 00:33.572
You're also Casey's professor
and you're way older than me.

00:33.573 --> 00:36.208
Casey's an adult, I think she
can handle you and me dating.

00:36.209 --> 00:38.580
- What is wrong with me?
- Nothing's wrong with you.

00:38.581 --> 00:41.485
In fact, you're gonna do
amazing things with your life.

00:43.772 --> 00:46.169
I know something good
happened to me last night.

00:46.170 --> 00:48.194
Maybe some mysteries are
never meant to be solved.

00:50.571 --> 00:53.811
OK, Dale's getting your cake,
Heath's getting your beer,

00:54.392 --> 00:59.066
and I gave our neighbors the
you're-not-really-invited invite

00:59.067 --> 01:00.834
so they won't complain about the noise.

01:00.835 --> 01:03.535
I can't believe I'm finally gonna be 21.

01:03.536 --> 01:04.808
And I can't believe Casey

01:04.809 --> 01:06.926
took the "Which of the
Friends Are You" Test

01:06.927 --> 01:10.030
and she's a Rachel. She wishes.

01:10.510 --> 01:12.819
More like a Ross. Or a Gunther.

01:13.068 --> 01:14.907
- They're still fighting?
- Haven't talked in weeks.

01:14.908 --> 01:18.109
Oh, God, she friended Tegan? Puke.

01:18.110 --> 01:20.965
Hey, Ash? Remember when we
talked about you staying here,

01:20.996 --> 01:22.490
we weren't gonna talk about Casey.

01:22.491 --> 01:24.287
Besides, we're focusing on Calvin's party.

01:24.288 --> 01:25.789
You're right. I'm sorry.

01:26.011 --> 01:28.021
I'm all about Calvin's party.

01:28.199 --> 01:30.830
Oh, and I can take care
of all the decorations.

01:30.831 --> 01:31.861
- No, you don't have to. 
- Please,

01:31.862 --> 01:33.520
I have a crappy minimum-wage job now.

01:33.555 --> 01:36.552
Think I can afford some
streamers and balloons.

01:36.805 --> 01:40.184
- All right. 
- So... is Casey coming?

01:40.696 --> 01:42.189
All right, Ash, if she is,

01:42.190 --> 01:43.819
there's to be no drama between you two,

01:43.820 --> 01:45.156
and no drama between my Omega

01:45.157 --> 01:46.958
Chi brothers and KT friends and boyfriend.

01:46.959 --> 01:48.485
That's why we're having the party here.

01:48.486 --> 01:51.464
Neutral territory.
Tomorrow, there's no haters.

01:51.470 --> 01:53.434
Only lovers of Calvin.

01:53.789 --> 01:55.596
Might need to get a bigger apartment.

01:56.207 --> 01:57.912
All right, I'm outta here.

01:57.913 --> 02:00.251
I will see you guys tomorrow
when I'm legally able to drink.

02:01.774 --> 02:02.790
Go get 'em.

02:09.295 --> 02:10.458
Well, I guess just you and me.

02:10.751 --> 02:12.259
I was thinking about watching some TV.

02:12.260 --> 02:14.459
There any top chefs, top models,

02:14.460 --> 02:16.182
big losers you need to check in on?

02:16.183 --> 02:17.757
Yeah, I could watch some TV.

02:21.863 --> 02:23.613
With a lot more snow in the forecast...

02:23.614 --> 02:27.416
...with the bulk of the snow
arriving late tomorrow,

02:27.417 --> 02:29.289
expecting ten to 12 inches

02:29.290 --> 02:30.608
in the Cypress Rose area,

02:30.628 --> 02:32.416
so you're gonna want to
stay in and bundle up,

02:32.417 --> 02:34.430
because those roads are
going to be slippery.

02:34.431 --> 02:36.203
You know, there's nothing on TV.

02:36.909 --> 02:37.898
We should just go to bed.

02:38.484 --> 02:41.017
I mean you should go to bed. Me, too.

02:42.102 --> 02:44.436
'Cause there's a big party tomorrow,
we should get some sleep.

02:46.476 --> 02:47.422
Good night.

02:49.262 --> 02:51.929
OK. Good night.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:08.756 --> 03:09.972
Can you believe it?

03:10.382 --> 03:12.867
They're predicting the
first snowstorm in Cyprus

03:12.868 --> 03:14.261
- in 50 years. 
- Mm-hm.

03:14.674 --> 03:16.691
They said ten to 12
inches by tomorrow night.

03:16.971 --> 03:18.219
Oh, my God, Ash ate a

03:18.220 --> 03:20.210
caramel pecan cheesecake
brownie 37 minutes ago

03:20.211 --> 03:21.635
posted a picture of it on Facebook!
What the hell?

03:23.088 --> 03:25.450
Ashleigh always hated nuts in her dessert.

03:25.451 --> 03:27.149
Well, Casey always liked snuggling.

03:27.150 --> 03:29.402
As well as more advanced
forms of snuggling.

03:29.403 --> 03:31.431
So why don't you move
within range of my arms,

03:31.432 --> 03:33.249
and other body parts?

03:34.322 --> 03:37.991
I'm just used to knowing what
Ashleigh's doing every minute.

03:37.992 --> 03:40.815
Even when she lived in New York.
Not that I even care that much.

03:40.816 --> 03:43.961
I'm doing fine without her.
But it's just weird,

03:43.962 --> 03:45.550
not talking to her. She doesn't

03:45.551 --> 03:47.320
even know that you and I got back together.

03:47.321 --> 03:48.409
Why do you care if she knows?

03:48.410 --> 03:49.823
I don't. It's none of her business.

03:49.824 --> 03:51.677
And she owes me an apology for our fight.

03:52.008 --> 03:53.437
I said some true things

03:53.438 --> 03:55.238
about her life that she
didn't want to hear,

03:55.239 --> 03:58.643
and she said some terrible,
untrue things about mine.

03:59.049 --> 04:00.858
- Terrible things? Like what?
- Oh, you know...

04:05.007 --> 04:08.347
Just stuff. Just... stuff.

04:09.415 --> 04:10.629
Like, stuff about me?

04:11.214 --> 04:13.207
It doesn't matter. You know,

04:13.208 --> 04:15.348
I don't think I'm gonna
go to Calvin's party.

04:15.349 --> 04:18.427
What? How can you not go?
It's at your own brother's apartment.

04:18.584 --> 04:19.510
I know, but things are

04:19.511 --> 04:21.503
- too raw between Ashleigh and I.
- As you wish.

04:21.990 --> 04:23.327
Thank you.

04:25.125 --> 04:27.393
Ashleigh became a fan of Color Me Badd!

04:27.394 --> 04:30.487
She hates '90s novelty bands.
What is going on with her?

04:30.703 --> 04:33.462
- Call her and find out. 
- Please.

04:34.093 --> 04:35.602
On a cold day in hell.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.126
Hey, what's that?

04:56.450 --> 04:57.885
Most prenuptial agreements

04:57.886 --> 05:00.550
stipulate mediation in case of divorce.

05:00.551 --> 05:05.189
But emotions can get out of hand
and a lawsuit can indeed result.

05:05.190 --> 05:08.069
Can anyone give me an applicable
tort, please? Ms. Parker?

05:08.070 --> 05:10.420
Alienation of affection.
In Shackleford v. Lundquist,

05:10.421 --> 05:13.111
a wife sued her husband's mistress
and was awarded millions.

05:13.112 --> 05:15.337
Good. Hope that doesn't scare
any of you away from marriage.

05:15.927 --> 05:17.907
On the other hand, the divorce rate

05:17.934 --> 05:21.413
in the legal profession is higher
than the national average.

05:21.414 --> 05:22.956
We used to call that the law school curse.

05:23.221 --> 05:26.591
Too much studying, and no time for...
anything else.

05:28.182 --> 05:30.594
Well, it's snowing already,
so why don't we finish early?

05:31.205 --> 05:32.265
Have a great weekend, everybody.

05:35.197 --> 05:38.066
- He's chipper today.
- Someone's getting laid.

05:38.100 --> 05:40.601
Well, if that's the case, I'd like
to thank whoever's responsible

05:40.636 --> 05:41.958
for getting us out early.

05:43.772 --> 05:46.774
Hey, what do you think about this
"Law school curse" Business?

05:46.809 --> 05:47.516
You and Rebecca have been

05:47.517 --> 05:48.843
together the whole time
we've been in law school.

05:48.877 --> 05:49.947
Has it caused any problems?

05:49.962 --> 05:52.580
Well, there was an adjustment period.

05:52.614 --> 05:55.183
But I don't know. You know how Rebecca is.

05:55.217 --> 05:58.480
She freaked out a few times.
But, uh, she seems fine now.

05:58.481 --> 06:00.755
Do you think I should be
worried about Cappie and me?

06:00.789 --> 06:02.061
Why do you come to me with this stuff?

06:02.062 --> 06:03.608
You know how I feel about Cappie.

06:03.609 --> 06:04.775
Because I'm still not talking

06:04.776 --> 06:06.524
to Ashleigh and I need to talk to someone

06:06.525 --> 06:10.034
about us getting back together,
and curses and things.

06:10.035 --> 06:12.864
Right. Try a girl. And as for the curse?

06:13.130 --> 06:16.235
- It's just a myth.
- Jim, stop smothering me!

06:16.236 --> 06:17.285
If you want someone to hold your

06:17.286 --> 06:20.235
hand and tell you how smart
you are, call your mother.

06:20.236 --> 06:22.514
Just like you do every day. I'm your wife!

06:22.515 --> 06:24.622
Well, maybe not for long! How about that?

06:25.063 --> 06:26.364
- Fine! 
- Jan?

06:27.813 --> 06:28.787
Jan?

06:29.335 --> 06:31.167
Was that the curse?
Should we be freaked out?

06:31.168 --> 06:32.894
Again, try a girl. Please.

06:36.768 --> 06:40.205
- Hot cocoa, ladies?
- Ooh! Yeah. I'm frozen.

06:40.412 --> 06:41.950
I can see how, being a KT,

06:41.951 --> 06:43.470
you might think "Ladies" Applies to you.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.292
- But does not.
- Fine. I just want to make sure

06:45.293 --> 06:46.450
you're good for the party tonight.

06:46.451 --> 06:47.938
And I wanted to ask you something.

06:47.939 --> 06:51.403
Have you noticed Ashleigh...
acting weird at all?

06:52.608 --> 06:54.232
- It's pretty obvious what that is. 
- What?

06:54.233 --> 06:55.187
She's fighting with Casey.

06:55.188 --> 06:56.608
And she figures since you're her brother,

06:56.609 --> 06:59.034
you'll always take Casey's side.
Come on. Let's face it.

06:59.035 --> 07:01.259
With that dimpled chin, those
buttery blonde highlights,

07:01.260 --> 07:04.131
it's pretty clear who's in the right here.
It's Casey.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.910
Yeah. Maybe that's it.

07:06.258 --> 07:08.027
Sounds like we could get
snowed in tonight, Dale.

07:08.028 --> 07:08.886
So some of the girls were

07:08.887 --> 07:11.258
wondering if we're stocked
up on graham crackers,

07:11.259 --> 07:13.084
chocolate bars, marshmallows?
We're making...

07:13.085 --> 07:14.978
S'mores. Yes, I figured it out.

07:14.979 --> 07:16.797
You'd think people around
here never seen snow before.

07:16.798 --> 07:17.506
I just wanna make sure

07:17.534 --> 07:19.403
you got the cake for
Calvin's party tonight.

07:19.404 --> 07:20.452
Yeah. It's in the fridge.

07:20.453 --> 07:22.737
So where is this party
at, and can anyone come?

07:23.325 --> 07:26.186
Sure, it's at our apartment.
I didn't know you knew Calvin.

07:26.187 --> 07:27.782
I don't. But I know you.

07:27.929 --> 07:30.655
You're Casey's brother and the
guy who stole the A&M goat.

07:30.860 --> 07:34.150
And I frickin' hate s'mores.
So I'll see you there, goat guy.

07:36.343 --> 07:37.818
That goat should've been ours.

07:37.819 --> 07:39.880
You mark my words, you KTs
are gonna pay for that.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.114
You seriously ended your
class early for me?

07:46.115 --> 07:48.171
I thought we could go out
before things gets worse,

07:48.172 --> 07:50.518
maybe get trapped somewhere together.

07:52.261 --> 07:54.105
Well, I can't.

07:54.624 --> 07:57.295
It's my friend's birthday.
I'm kinda dreading it anyway.

07:57.296 --> 07:58.849
I think Casey might be there.

07:59.159 --> 08:00.889
She still doesn't know we're dating, right?

08:00.921 --> 08:03.008
Maybe you two should bury the hatchet.

08:03.009 --> 08:06.447
I could come with you, if you
want, for moral support.

08:07.857 --> 08:09.423
I don't think seeing us

08:09.424 --> 08:11.166
together would be the best way to make up.

08:11.167 --> 08:13.940
Well, um...
call me if you change your mind.

08:14.375 --> 08:17.733
- OK. Bye. 
- Bye.

08:26.044 --> 08:28.864
Was that guy bothering you?
I'll kick him out if you want.

08:29.852 --> 08:32.711
Oh, he's gone. See? It worked.

08:32.712 --> 08:35.150
- What do you want, Cap?
- Look, I want us to be friends.

08:35.152 --> 08:36.253
I know you and Casey aren't

08:36.256 --> 08:38.926
talking and I hope I
wasn't the cause of that

08:38.927 --> 08:41.192
by suggesting you take
that job here at Dobler's.

08:41.193 --> 08:42.341
It was a stupid thing to say,

08:42.342 --> 08:44.125
because I think that you're way too good

08:44.126 --> 08:45.361
for a crappy job like that.

08:46.335 --> 08:48.282
I meant, what do you want to drink?

08:52.142 --> 08:54.125
Did I...? Did I say "Crappy?"

08:54.160 --> 08:55.842
I meant "Great!"

08:56.244 --> 08:57.973
Why do you even care if we're fighting?

08:57.974 --> 08:59.588
It's not like you and
Casey are back together.

09:00.631 --> 09:01.791
Why do you care that I care?

09:01.792 --> 09:04.293
Why is there no Real World Cleveland?

09:04.389 --> 09:06.889
Will the Bonus Jonas prove
to be the best Jonas?

09:06.890 --> 09:09.202
There's just so many questions,
and so few answers.

09:09.203 --> 09:10.816
Well, stay warm.

09:13.242 --> 09:14.623
Hey, girlfriend!

09:15.539 --> 09:19.233
Hey! I feel like I haven't
seen you in forever.

09:19.234 --> 09:22.866
- Uh, I saw you this morning.
- But we haven't really talked.

09:23.356 --> 09:24.966
I asked you to replace the

09:24.967 --> 09:26.827
sponge that smells like hot
dogs, and you said fine.

09:26.828 --> 09:30.488
I know, but really talked.
Like, about life, friends, guys...

09:30.489 --> 09:32.587
Are you trying to have girl talk with me?

09:33.564 --> 09:36.391
- I don't do girl talk.
- Wait, wait! It's just that,

09:36.392 --> 09:39.604
I'm not talking to Ashleigh right now.
Not that I need to.

09:39.605 --> 09:41.442
I have other gal pals, like you!

09:42.410 --> 09:46.277
See, I just found out about this
so-called law school curse...

09:48.105 --> 09:49.250
What law school curse?

09:49.251 --> 09:51.505
That law school ruins relationships.

09:51.783 --> 09:53.340
But it's probably a myth, right?

09:53.341 --> 09:55.293
Because Evan said everything
is fine with you guys.

09:55.294 --> 09:58.697
Of course he did.
Everything's fine, and I'm crazy.

09:58.698 --> 09:59.695
Never mind the fact that he's

09:59.696 --> 10:03.220
obviously pulling away from me...
in every area.

10:03.500 --> 10:04.647
Were there any signs that things

10:04.648 --> 10:06.632
were going badly before
you and Evan broke up?

10:06.641 --> 10:10.637
Um... he slept with you.

10:13.449 --> 10:14.294
Right.

10:15.334 --> 10:17.590
It's probably weird for us to
even be talking about this.

10:17.591 --> 10:19.523
- See you later, Case. 
- Wait, wait, wait!

10:19.524 --> 10:20.584
I... i...

10:26.898 --> 10:28.689
Hey. I hope people like pretzels.

10:29.207 --> 10:30.473
They were having this amazing sale.

10:30.474 --> 10:32.408
Oh, my God, do I look that stupid?

10:32.743 --> 10:34.408
OK, it wasn't that good of a sale.

10:36.001 --> 10:39.918
So I ran into Cappie today and he
acted strange... er than usual.

10:40.219 --> 10:44.851
So I did a little digging.
Two days ago, at 12:17am,

10:45.128 --> 10:46.251
Casey posted a status

10:46.252 --> 10:48.928
update saying Sandra
Bullock was "Inspiring."

10:48.929 --> 10:52.485
So then I cross-referenced that
with Cappie's page and at 12:37,

10:52.486 --> 10:54.561
he joined the "Betty White
for President" Fan club.

10:55.512 --> 10:58.269
They were watching The Proposal. Together!

10:59.122 --> 11:00.786
They're back together, aren't they?

11:01.166 --> 11:03.468
God! I can't believe I was
thinking about making up with her.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.401
And I can't believe you didn't tell me.

11:07.703 --> 11:08.948
Ash, wait...

11:11.391 --> 11:12.931
Look, I love Calvin, but I really

11:12.932 --> 11:15.240
don't think I can be around
Casey and Cappie tonight.

11:15.241 --> 11:18.749
So I'm just gonna go meet up with a...
with a friend.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.302
Come on, Ash, you have to stay.

11:20.478 --> 11:21.715
I'm sorry I didn't tell you,

11:21.716 --> 11:24.076
but we made a deal that we
wouldn't talk about Casey

11:24.077 --> 11:25.835
and, frankly, I didn't want

11:25.836 --> 11:27.718
her in our friendship
more than she is already.

11:27.991 --> 11:29.835
Casey isn't in our friendship.

11:31.201 --> 11:33.194
Then why have you been
acting weird around me?

11:35.035 --> 11:38.144
Because...
Because Casey's in our friendship!

11:38.312 --> 11:39.661
And because she's your sister.

11:40.463 --> 11:42.808
But you're my friend who
means a lot to me, too.

11:44.199 --> 11:45.752
You've been dealing with so much,

11:45.753 --> 11:47.029
I just want to be there for you.

11:48.237 --> 11:49.858
Don't worry about Casey, OK?

11:52.028 --> 11:54.478
- OK. 
- So you'll come?

11:59.707 --> 12:04.595
Um, I'll have to think about it.
Um... I'll...

12:05.100 --> 12:05.758
...see you later.

12:18.021 --> 12:20.304
Hey, Rus? Heath picked up the... Oh.

12:21.863 --> 12:24.313
OK. If that's supposed to

12:24.314 --> 12:25.862
be my birthday present,
that's not my thing.

12:25.863 --> 12:27.670
He's definitely not into that.

12:34.792 --> 12:36.681
Rus, this is Ashleigh we're talking about.

12:36.682 --> 12:38.839
It's not like she's the only
girl who has that shade.

12:38.840 --> 12:39.624
But it looks like the color

12:39.625 --> 12:41.155
I had on when I woke up after Homecoming.

12:42.466 --> 12:45.242
You bought pretzels, too?
Heath, you were supposed to get beer.

12:45.243 --> 12:47.073
- No, you were supposed to get beer.
- I'm underage!

12:48.310 --> 12:50.067
- Oh, that's right.
- Look,

12:50.068 --> 12:52.082
I know Ashleigh really
likes you as a friend.

12:52.083 --> 12:53.799
A friend who was best
friends with your sister,

12:53.886 --> 12:55.346
and who's now living with you.

12:55.347 --> 12:58.574
So if you're cross this line,
it could change everything.

12:58.575 --> 13:00.866
I know. There's no reason in the world

13:00.867 --> 13:03.332
a girl like Ashleigh would
ever be into a guy like me.

13:03.333 --> 13:05.249
But I think there's something
happening between us.

13:05.250 --> 13:07.358
I've felt it, and I think she has, too.

13:07.359 --> 13:09.986
Has she given you any of the
usual signs that she's into you?

13:09.987 --> 13:11.446
Has she ever touched your arm when

13:11.447 --> 13:14.129
you're talking or does she get
jealous around other girls?

13:14.130 --> 13:16.336
Has she... Oh, has she ever held

13:16.337 --> 13:18.864
your gaze and smiled at
you from across a room?

13:19.083 --> 13:21.191
I haven't really been
looking for anz*** of that.

13:21.192 --> 13:22.960
Well, you're gonna be around her all night.

13:22.961 --> 13:23.933
Good time to find out.

13:27.793 --> 13:29.921
A mensa et thoro.

13:29.922 --> 13:32.625
A dissolution of marriage from
causes of cruelty or desertion.

13:34.644 --> 13:37.191
- Casey? Keep up. 
- Oh... Sorry.

13:37.192 --> 13:39.366
Wait. You're in law school
and in a relationship.

13:39.612 --> 13:42.584
You mean Walter? Um, I wouldn't
really call it a relationship.

13:42.585 --> 13:45.895
It's more like two consenting
adults fulfilling mutual needs,

13:45.896 --> 13:48.145
quite frequently, with a
consistent level of satisfaction.

13:49.084 --> 13:52.054
Right. Well, um, if you
were in a relationship,

13:52.055 --> 13:54.309
would you be worried about
the law school curse?

13:54.848 --> 13:57.348
Are we talking Cappie?
Why don't you give me the facts.

13:57.349 --> 13:58.274
OK. Well, um...

14:00.381 --> 14:03.165
Cappie and I dated freshman
year, then we broke up,

14:03.467 --> 14:05.997
then we hooked up, then we
almost got back together,

14:06.309 --> 14:08.276
then I threw myself at him and he said no,

14:08.593 --> 14:11.002
then we got back together again,
then we broke up again,

14:11.003 --> 14:12.346
then we hooked up again.

14:12.347 --> 14:14.443
And now we're back together... again.

14:15.715 --> 14:17.501
That doesn't sound promising, does it?

14:17.953 --> 14:20.084
I don't think that it's
my opinion that you want.

14:20.189 --> 14:22.164
I think there's someone
else you need to talk to.

14:23.105 --> 14:25.100
- Oprah?
- Ashleigh.

14:25.101 --> 14:27.287
I think she knows you and
your relationship with Cappie

14:27.288 --> 14:29.641
a little bit better than I do.
That might be more relevant

14:29.642 --> 14:33.594
- than my IQ of 168.
- Yeah, I do, I need to talk to Ashleigh.

14:34.337 --> 14:38.328
I'm going to do it tonight,
at Calvin's party.

14:39.457 --> 14:42.350
- Attagirl. 
- Yeah.

14:55.820 --> 14:58.866
- Well, hello to you, too.
- What do you say

14:58.867 --> 15:00.586
we show up to the party fashionably late?

15:00.865 --> 15:01.978
Casey's already left, so

15:01.979 --> 15:03.981
no house mommy scolding
us for being naughty.

15:03.982 --> 15:06.472
And, uh, I will be naughty.

15:08.194 --> 15:09.666
It's really coming down out there.

15:09.667 --> 15:11.585
- We could get stuck here. 
- Even better.

15:14.175 --> 15:15.348
Rebecca...

15:16.736 --> 15:18.651
Come on, it's Calvin's birthday.

15:22.584 --> 15:23.542
This is the law school

15:23.543 --> 15:25.252
curse that Casey was
talking about, isn't it?

15:25.583 --> 15:27.055
- Casey told you about that?
- Yes.

15:28.271 --> 15:29.015
And you can't tell me

15:29.016 --> 15:31.261
that nothing's wrong
again, because there is.

15:31.262 --> 15:32.500
We need to talk about this.

15:36.917 --> 15:38.638
This is not the place to discuss it.

15:40.367 --> 15:42.981
OK? We'll figure it out.

15:43.585 --> 15:46.211
But for now, let's just try to

15:46.212 --> 15:48.361
have a good time at our
friend's birthday party.

15:53.298 --> 15:54.114
Fine.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.409
Hey. Glad you're here.

16:04.712 --> 16:07.316
Oh, yeah. You were right.
Couldn't miss Calvin's b-day.

16:07.398 --> 16:08.675
And if Casey isn't worried about me

16:08.676 --> 16:10.393
seeing her with Cappie, then
I'm not worried about...

16:11.637 --> 16:15.087
...about anything either.
Um, I invited my friend from earlier.

16:15.088 --> 16:17.052
- Hope that's OK.
- Yeah, the more the merrier.

16:17.053 --> 16:18.171
A couple people texted me,

16:18.172 --> 16:19.674
said they couldn't make
it because of the snow.

16:21.101 --> 16:25.298
Well, Heath's gonna be late.
Apparently, they closed Route 9.

16:25.299 --> 16:26.602
He better get here quick with the beer.

16:26.603 --> 16:28.767
Twenty bags of pretzels
can only do so much.

16:28.768 --> 16:30.018
Relax. It'll be fine.

16:34.151 --> 16:36.286
Shoulder. Is that the same as the arm?

16:36.287 --> 16:37.666
Yeah, I mean, it's the top of the arm.

16:38.031 --> 16:40.905
- Or the bottom of the neck.
- It's around there.

16:41.739 --> 16:43.638
- Oh, here they are. 
- Hey, Rusty.

16:43.639 --> 16:46.025
Dale? I didn't know you
were going to be here.

16:46.235 --> 16:48.093
At his apartment? Where he lives?

16:48.311 --> 16:51.065
Thanks for letting us come.
It's really cold out there.

16:51.066 --> 16:52.793
I wasn't sure if we'd be able to make it.

16:52.794 --> 16:55.680
Hope it lets up so the rest
of his friends can make it.

16:55.681 --> 16:56.991
Great place, Rusty. I don't

16:57.018 --> 16:58.467
know a lot of people
that live in apartments.

16:58.468 --> 17:00.857
It's so... adult.

17:01.153 --> 17:05.683
- We got a futon and everything.
- Abby! What are you doing here?

17:05.721 --> 17:06.583
Oh, Rusty invited me.

17:06.708 --> 17:08.694
I didn't know that you
two knew each other.

17:08.718 --> 17:10.752
- We don't, really. 
- Not yet.

17:11.790 --> 17:14.627
So I see.
Are you in the habit of showing up

17:14.632 --> 17:18.031
at a strange man's apartment not...
uninvited?

17:18.032 --> 17:19.776
- Um... what? 
- Take your coat?

17:20.099 --> 17:20.842
- Yeah. 
- OK.

17:28.667 --> 17:31.592
All right. Are you ready, champ?

17:32.345 --> 17:33.887
She's Ashleigh, not Chuck Liddell.

17:35.912 --> 17:36.977
He's a boxer, right?

17:45.338 --> 17:47.475
Ashleigh. Um, can we talk?

17:48.360 --> 17:50.471
- Rebecca, hi! 
- Hi!

17:56.626 --> 17:58.512
- Hey. Thanks for coming. 
- Hi.

17:59.408 --> 18:01.814
- It's getting cold. 
- Hi.

18:03.549 --> 18:05.325
- Hey, man. How you doing?
- Happy birthday.

18:05.689 --> 18:07.884
- Good to see you.
- Thanks for coming.

18:07.910 --> 18:11.443
- Ouch. - Listen, you're down,
you're not out, champ. OK?

18:11.790 --> 18:13.496
We'll just let her cool off and try again.

18:17.100 --> 18:19.864
I'd love a personal tour
of your apartment, Dale.

18:19.865 --> 18:21.459
I'd love some more pretzels.

18:23.288 --> 18:24.896
Hey, Dale! What's the deal?

18:25.206 --> 18:26.300
We can't do book club anymore

18:26.301 --> 18:28.642
since you've joined the
sub-literates at Omega Chi?

18:28.643 --> 18:30.594
According to Trip, you're just
jealous 'cause you're a KT.

18:30.595 --> 18:33.621
And according to Trip, you'll
find out who has the best house

18:33.622 --> 18:36.288
once Trip-n-Dale kick your butts
at the Beer Pong World Series.

18:36.289 --> 18:38.223
- I thought it was Cap-n-Dale. 
- It was.

18:38.286 --> 18:40.758
- Since when do you play Beer Pong?
- Since I pledged the best

18:40.759 --> 18:43.426
fraternity on campus.
According to Trip, I'm a natural.

18:43.427 --> 18:44.747
Oh, you are, are you? Well,

18:44.748 --> 18:46.535
what do you say to a little
game of Beer Pong right now?

18:46.566 --> 18:49.829
- Sans beer, apparently.
- Hey, Cap, no House stuff.

18:49.830 --> 18:52.172
- It's Calvin's birthday, remember?
- Right.

18:52.369 --> 18:55.331
There's nothing wrong with
a couple of civilians

18:55.332 --> 18:57.895
playing a friendly game of... Jenga!

18:58.811 --> 19:02.016
- You in? 
- Jenga? It's my middle name.

19:02.017 --> 19:02.802
Let's play.

19:16.404 --> 19:17.795
It was really weird. She

19:17.796 --> 19:20.345
seemed jealous when I was
talking to Abby, right?

19:20.346 --> 19:23.199
- Isn't that a sign?
- OK, maybe there is something there.

19:32.190 --> 19:33.535
I'm gonna go talk to her.

19:38.837 --> 19:40.059
Hey, Ash. Look, I'm sorry I

19:40.074 --> 19:42.366
didn't tell you about
Cappie before tonight.

19:42.561 --> 19:45.557
Oh, please! I already knew.
I read all about The Proposal online.

19:45.817 --> 19:47.494
- Cappie didn't propose. 
- No,

19:47.495 --> 19:49.190
but Sandra Bullock did to Ryan Reynolds

19:49.194 --> 19:50.429
in the movie that you two watched together.

19:50.615 --> 19:51.876
I figured it out on Facebook.

19:51.877 --> 19:54.528
You Facebook stalked me? Who does that?

19:54.529 --> 19:56.769
Look, I don't care about
you and Cappie anymore,

19:56.770 --> 19:58.737
anyway. I have my own
love life to think about.

19:59.325 --> 20:01.190
- Hi, Simon. 
- Hey.

20:03.757 --> 20:05.622
Why is she kissing my law professor?

20:05.723 --> 20:07.502
Why is she making out
with my law professor?

20:07.503 --> 20:08.805
Why is she kissing that old guy?

20:20.241 --> 20:22.736
Well, Heath just called.

20:22.737 --> 20:24.452
And apparently the roads are closed.

20:24.453 --> 20:26.241
So he's not coming back with any beer.

20:26.791 --> 20:28.867
- Want a drink? 
- What is it?

20:29.070 --> 20:30.913
Vanilla extract and tonic.

20:31.935 --> 20:33.985
I can't believe I thought
Ashleigh was into me.

20:34.460 --> 20:35.791
Look, now you have your answer.

20:35.792 --> 20:37.345
So maybe you should stop
focusing on someone

20:37.346 --> 20:39.297
who's not into you and try
focusing on someone who is.

20:42.647 --> 20:45.637
- Not me. That girl Abby. 
- Oh, OK.

20:45.638 --> 20:47.694
You're right. I'm going for it.

20:52.641 --> 20:56.367
So you two are dating. How did that happen?

20:57.565 --> 21:00.139
I guess we, uh...
I guess we owe it all to you, Casey.

21:02.323 --> 21:04.136
Fascinating story.

21:04.501 --> 21:06.398
Ashleigh, I need to go the bathroom.

21:06.710 --> 21:08.270
Oh. It's right over there.

21:08.333 --> 21:11.175
Well, you know, you couldn't
have found a better girl.

21:11.408 --> 21:14.286
We've been friends for years, right, Ash?

21:14.799 --> 21:15.772
I guess?

21:16.849 --> 21:19.839
Yeah. Oh, speaking of
great girls, Professor,

21:19.840 --> 21:21.802
I'd like to officially

21:21.803 --> 21:24.197
introduce you to my
girlfriend, Rebecca Logan.

21:25.315 --> 21:29.002
A very impressive young lady.
Her father is Senator Ken Logan.

21:29.003 --> 21:29.839
You remember the senator's

21:29.860 --> 21:31.706
tort reform ideas from a few years back?

21:31.888 --> 21:33.564
Yes, that was before he had sex

21:33.576 --> 21:35.396
with all those hookers and
resigned in disgrace.

21:35.484 --> 21:36.716
Impressive, right? Excuse me.

21:40.798 --> 21:41.801
Sorry about that.

21:43.883 --> 21:45.971
Um... Rebecca's just a little bit dramatic.

21:45.972 --> 21:46.674
Listen, I was gonna go

21:46.675 --> 21:48.673
track down the drinks.
Do you want anything?

21:48.674 --> 21:49.654
I'm not much of a drinker.

21:50.793 --> 21:54.286
The recovery time's a bit longer at my age.

21:56.774 --> 21:59.797
And what is that age, exactly?

21:59.798 --> 22:02.669
Does it start with a three? Or a four?

22:02.670 --> 22:03.932
Casey, Simon hasn't had the

22:03.933 --> 22:08.025
pleasure of meeting your
brand-new old boyfriend.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.735
Oh, yeah, he's right over there.

22:12.755 --> 22:14.269
Oh! Jenga!

22:14.734 --> 22:17.121
- Suck it, Kettle-smell!
- Two out of three?

22:18.578 --> 22:23.507
Cappie's youthful exuberance
is part of why I love him.

22:23.508 --> 22:24.455
It's good. I'm glad there are

22:24.456 --> 22:27.140
some couples who are surviving
the law school curse.

22:28.580 --> 22:30.719
I had to call security
on Jim and Jan today.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.379
Ashleigh, I really need to

22:32.380 --> 22:34.442
go to the bathroom. Are you coming or what?

22:34.443 --> 22:35.796
Just give it up and go pee already.

22:41.242 --> 22:43.213
It's so cool that you got the A&M goat.

22:43.598 --> 22:45.283
Weren't you scared you
were gonna get caught?

22:45.571 --> 22:46.212
How'd you do it?

22:46.764 --> 22:48.638
We went in, and we got him.

22:50.525 --> 22:52.518
Do you think it's weird when a

22:52.519 --> 22:54.973
person dates someone who's
a lot older than them?

22:54.974 --> 22:56.709
Oh, yeah, other than Edward and Bella,

22:56.710 --> 22:58.540
obviously. I just don't get it.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.479
I really like guys more my own age.

23:03.742 --> 23:05.660
Yeah. Maybe you'll meet one someday.

23:12.674 --> 23:13.952
I'm starting to doubt that.

23:14.736 --> 23:15.861
I'm out of pretzels.

23:28.982 --> 23:31.618
A-ha! I saw that clump on
your left lower lashes

23:31.623 --> 23:33.686
and I knew you'd have to come in
here to fix it sooner or later!

23:33.687 --> 23:36.150
Oh, my God! Are you insane?
I could have blinded myself!

23:36.151 --> 23:37.501
Oh, are you sure you're not blind already?

23:37.502 --> 23:38.412
Do you not realize you're dating

23:38.413 --> 23:41.795
a guy who's old enough to be...
Color Me Badd!

23:41.796 --> 23:43.244
That's why you fanned them on Facebook!

23:43.749 --> 23:45.332
You Facebook stalked me, too!

23:45.333 --> 23:47.428
Admit it, you two have nothing in common!

23:47.429 --> 23:49.247
You're just dating him to get back at me!

23:49.248 --> 23:50.137
I am not!

23:51.439 --> 23:52.997
Look, Case, you already
got what you wanted.

23:52.998 --> 23:56.073
You and Cappie will defy the law
school curse and get married

23:56.074 --> 24:00.236
and have your minivan and 2.3 kids.
So have a nice life.

24:00.237 --> 24:03.141
Who said anything about marriage and kids?!

24:05.154 --> 24:06.929
I know we agreed not to
talk about Casey, but...

24:06.930 --> 24:10.602
...she actually thinks I'm only
dating Simon to get back at her.

24:11.443 --> 24:12.108
Are you?

24:16.353 --> 24:17.586
There's nothing to drink, it's

24:17.587 --> 24:19.944
cold as hell and you're
obviously into someone else.

24:19.945 --> 24:21.359
So I'm gonna go home, because I am

24:21.360 --> 24:23.987
not one of these needy girls
desperate for attention!

24:26.004 --> 24:28.143
You have such a gentle touch.

24:30.477 --> 24:32.714
Yes! I win again!

24:32.715 --> 24:35.701
Suck it, you... civilian

24:35.702 --> 24:39.322
who will return to being an
Omega Chi douche tomorrow.

24:39.618 --> 24:41.944
This is your fault!
Why are you even still here?!

24:41.945 --> 24:46.044
Fine! I'm leaving.
This party totally sucks anyway.

24:46.045 --> 24:47.783
And I can tell when I'm not wanted.

24:48.314 --> 24:50.077
I don't think that's entirely true!

24:52.271 --> 24:55.826
Desperate, bitchy girl is right.
This party does suck.

24:55.827 --> 24:57.460
I'm boyfriend-less, the thermostat

24:57.461 --> 25:00.013
is clearly broken and we're
all stone-cold sober...

25:00.308 --> 25:03.301
- Literally.
- I have an idea. Let's all go to Dobler.

25:03.302 --> 25:07.030
That's a place where
there's heat, and alcohol.

25:07.069 --> 25:10.333
Dobler's is closed.
The whole town is shut down because of snow.

25:10.334 --> 25:12.373
Not if you're the new
waitress and you have a key!

25:12.639 --> 25:14.244
Come on, we can all walk. Who's in?

25:15.588 --> 25:17.188
I'm gonna pass. I don't

25:17.189 --> 25:18.628
think your friends are gonna want me there.

25:19.469 --> 25:21.898
That's not true.
You guys want him there, right?

25:23.842 --> 25:25.926
- Is that spreading?
- We'd love for you to come, sir.

25:25.927 --> 25:28.089
Another time, Mr. Chambers. Thank you.

25:28.195 --> 25:30.364
- Uh, you have fun. 
- OK.

25:35.980 --> 25:38.125
So, anyone else want to crap out,

25:38.654 --> 25:40.589
or are you guys ready to
celebrate Calvin's birthday?

25:40.899 --> 25:42.538
Trudge all the way in the snow to Dobler's?

25:42.826 --> 25:43.735
Yeah, I don't think so.

25:44.034 --> 25:47.080
- Come on. 
- Don't be a party pooper.

25:47.273 --> 25:49.045
Everyone else wants to go.

25:49.046 --> 25:51.385
Are we really gonna do this?
The eight of us?

25:53.366 --> 25:55.448
Fine, consider this your
birthday present, Calvin.

25:55.752 --> 25:58.518
Yay. Just what I always wanted.

26:02.644 --> 26:05.058
- This sucks.
- I think it feels like Christmas.

26:05.059 --> 26:06.582
Or that scene from Gremlins

26:06.583 --> 26:08.619
where they beat the crap
out of the whole town.

26:08.768 --> 26:11.346
- No. 
- Like Omega Chi does to KT

26:11.347 --> 26:14.203
- at pretty much everything. Up top.
- Yeah, bro.

26:14.204 --> 26:16.672
- Everything but stealing goats.
- And Jenga.

26:16.673 --> 26:18.395
Would you guys just give it a rest?

26:19.146 --> 26:21.163
Even the Germans and the British

26:21.164 --> 26:23.238
put aside their differences
during World War I

26:23.239 --> 26:26.028
and came out of the trenches and
celebrated Christmas together.

26:26.029 --> 26:30.691
Yeah. Instead of Jesus, we're
celebrating the birth of Calvin.

26:30.892 --> 26:34.258
- It's Calvinmas! 
- I just wanted one night

26:34.724 --> 26:37.250
for everybody to stop fighting.
Is that even possible?

26:45.658 --> 26:49.083
It is. So let's sing Calvinmas carols.

27:13.135 --> 27:14.722
Are you sure it's OK we're here?

27:14.723 --> 27:16.538
Who cares? Thank God for heat.

27:16.539 --> 27:19.193
- Thank God for beer!
- Let's not go too crazy.

27:19.194 --> 27:23.427
If my manager finds out, I could lose my job.
My crappy job.

27:23.943 --> 27:26.456
Screw it, knock yourselves out.

27:27.491 --> 27:28.655
Hey! Beer Pong!

27:28.656 --> 27:29.580
What do you say, Cap?

27:29.581 --> 27:30.842
Want to give me a chance
to make up for Jenga?

27:30.843 --> 27:32.236
- See what I got? 
- You're the Germans,

27:32.237 --> 27:33.364
we're the British, remember?

27:33.365 --> 27:34.931
Besides, I've always wanted to do this.

27:40.413 --> 27:41.332
I'm OK!

27:42.943 --> 27:44.052
Hand me that soda thing.

27:44.053 --> 27:45.215
- I've always wanted to play with it.
- Boom.

27:45.216 --> 27:46.608
I'll go put on some music.

27:46.845 --> 27:49.008
I would like a drink. And since I'm legal,

27:49.009 --> 27:51.266
bartender, a whiskey sour, please.

27:51.267 --> 27:53.272
- I'll have to see some ID, sir.
- With pleasure.

27:55.070 --> 27:57.074
I don't know. Calvin Owens?

27:57.075 --> 27:58.525
- This looks fake. 
- Come on, Cap.

27:58.530 --> 28:00.336
I don't know.
I could lose my imaginary license.

28:00.463 --> 28:01.631
I'll serve you. What do you want?

28:02.102 --> 28:04.241
- You? What can you make? 
- Yeah.

28:04.313 --> 28:05.638
I can make pretty much anything.

28:05.943 --> 28:07.430
Once you quit Party Down Catering,

28:07.431 --> 28:09.062
they bumped me up to full bartender.

28:10.735 --> 28:12.442
- Whiskey sour? 
- No, I got it.

28:12.443 --> 28:13.345
- No, I got it. 
- No, I got it.

28:13.346 --> 28:14.072
I got it.

28:20.444 --> 28:21.788
Shouldn't you be over there groveling?

28:22.772 --> 28:23.954
I would've thought Calvin's speech

28:23.955 --> 28:25.738
would've inspired you and
Ash to kiss and make up.

28:26.990 --> 28:30.076
How can I make up with someone
who's gone completely insane?

28:30.342 --> 28:33.020
The older man thing can be a turn-on.
Always worked for my dad.

28:33.157 --> 28:35.456
Senator Ken Logan, in case
you wanted to name drop.

28:35.457 --> 28:37.068
Yeah, what Evan did was messed up.

28:37.851 --> 28:41.460
But law school has a way of
bringing out the desperate in us.

28:41.461 --> 28:43.276
Or maybe you were right
about the law school curse.

28:43.277 --> 28:44.931
Oh, come on, there is no curse.

28:44.932 --> 28:47.015
There are plenty of
thriving couples out there

28:47.016 --> 28:48.406
- with lawyers in them.
- Name one.

28:50.100 --> 28:52.399
Miranda and Steve. Sex and the City.

28:52.681 --> 28:54.469
Yes, he cheated on her, but they made

28:54.470 --> 28:56.532
it to the Brooklyn Bridge and
reunited in the first movie.

28:57.734 --> 28:59.259
If the only example you can come up

28:59.260 --> 29:01.975
with is a fictitious couple
from a worn-out franchise,

29:02.770 --> 29:04.810
then I think both of our
relationships are screwed.

29:11.484 --> 29:14.127
No. I'm just saying that
if I had to choose,

29:14.310 --> 29:16.910
- I would choose ninja.
- Yeah, no, no, I concur.

29:16.911 --> 29:20.582
Nunchucks are way cooler
than, what, a peg leg.

29:20.583 --> 29:22.559
But wenches and rum! Pirates win.

29:22.560 --> 29:24.019
I arrrrrgg-gree!

29:26.275 --> 29:28.195
You guys ever noticed
that old bottle up there?

29:28.455 --> 29:30.061
I've never seen anybody order from it

29:30.085 --> 29:31.783
and I've always wondered what it was.

29:31.784 --> 29:34.418
What if it's a magical
elixir that causes visions?

29:34.784 --> 29:37.012
- Or blindness.
- Guess there's only one way to find out.

29:39.398 --> 29:41.350
- Who's in? 
- No.

29:41.351 --> 29:43.175
- Yes! 
- The snow's getting worse.

29:43.176 --> 29:45.441
We're not going anywhere. All right. Yes.

29:45.442 --> 29:46.321
All right. Sign me up.

29:49.160 --> 29:51.441
- All right.
- Vile smelling.

29:51.442 --> 29:53.098
- Oh, my God. It's thick. 
- Oh, no...

29:55.252 --> 29:56.159
I'm rethinking this.

29:56.160 --> 29:56.887
All right.

29:57.583 --> 29:58.377
Birthday boy.

30:00.009 --> 30:01.868
- OK. 
- Here we go. All right.

30:02.305 --> 30:05.754
Here's lookin' at ya'.
Maybe for the last time.

30:06.159 --> 30:07.170
- Down the hatch. 
- All right.

30:09.995 --> 30:11.425
- Oh, God! 
- Oh, my God!

30:14.402 --> 30:18.098
Uh, um, it tastes like... feet.

30:19.320 --> 30:21.130
It couldn't be worse than the sludge Trip

30:21.131 --> 30:23.531
- and the guys make us drink.
- I still cannot get used to you

30:23.532 --> 30:26.029
being an Omega Chi pledge.
That's weird, right?

30:26.030 --> 30:27.401
The funny thing is, if you

30:27.404 --> 30:28.911
and Rusty never roomed
together freshman year,

30:29.053 --> 30:30.742
you wouldn't even care
about the Greek system.

30:30.743 --> 30:32.374
And if you had never met Rusty,

30:32.375 --> 30:33.535
then you wouldn't be with Heath now.

30:33.536 --> 30:35.531
No, I'd like to think Heath
and I would have found

30:35.532 --> 30:37.752
- each other eventually.
- What if Casey and Evan

30:37.753 --> 30:38.678
had never broken up? We

30:38.679 --> 30:40.886
wouldn't be so blissfully
happy together now.

30:40.887 --> 30:42.317
Yeah, and what if Rusty had

30:42.318 --> 30:44.611
never told Casey about
seeing you two do the nasty?

30:44.671 --> 30:47.011
- We might both be Omega Chi now.
- Doubt that.

30:47.012 --> 30:49.844
Know what? Maybe in some
parallel universe you are.

30:49.845 --> 30:51.767
William James, this American philosopher,

30:51.781 --> 30:52.859
he called it a "Multiverse."

30:52.860 --> 30:54.192
It's basically parallel realities

30:54.193 --> 30:56.529
that make up all conceivable possibilities.

30:56.530 --> 30:58.936
So somewhere, I am Iron Man.

30:59.682 --> 31:01.196
All right, all right.

31:01.197 --> 31:03.443
When did you become such
an expert on philosophy?

31:03.444 --> 31:05.775
- Uh, since I declared it my major.
- Your major?

31:05.950 --> 31:09.523
- Well, sell really has frozen over.
- Hey, Evan.

31:09.583 --> 31:11.024
Do you think you would you have given

31:11.025 --> 31:12.825
Rusty a bid if he hadn't told
me about you and Rebecca?

31:13.353 --> 31:15.610
- Sure, absolutely. 
- Yeah, right.

31:15.611 --> 31:17.759
There is one way to find out
if he's telling the truth.

31:17.987 --> 31:19.375
Waterboarding. I'll get the bucket.

31:19.838 --> 31:23.993
No! Kiss or Tell. It's a game we
used to play at boarding school.

31:24.720 --> 31:25.775
You ask someone a question,

31:26.370 --> 31:28.439
and they have to totally answer truthfully,

31:28.789 --> 31:30.087
or they have to totally kiss you.

31:30.088 --> 31:31.222
Didn't you go to an all-girls

31:31.223 --> 31:32.997
- boarding school? 
- What's your point?

31:34.509 --> 31:36.177
That sounds totally dumb.

31:36.178 --> 31:38.297
- Yep. 
- Let's play something else.

31:38.542 --> 31:40.698
Well, it's Calvin's birthday.
What do you want to do?

31:42.532 --> 31:43.494
I say let's do it.

31:44.577 --> 31:48.472
Great. All right.
I will get more glasses and the feet juice.

31:48.473 --> 31:50.032
You know, actually, it's
starting to grow on me.

31:52.984 --> 31:55.949
OK, just to be clear, you
have to tell the truth

31:56.093 --> 31:58.030
or you have to kiss someone. And Calvin,

31:58.031 --> 31:59.896
since it's your birthday,
you get to go first.

32:00.344 --> 32:02.119
Let's see, what should I ask...?

32:06.639 --> 32:07.868
I guess it's a start.

32:08.625 --> 32:12.412
- Calvin, is this your best birthday ever?
- Boring.

32:12.741 --> 32:15.527
That's easy. Kiss.

32:16.539 --> 32:18.236
Goody. I've always wanted to do this.

32:23.684 --> 32:25.630
No, still gay.

32:27.146 --> 32:29.893
OK, my turn.
Uh, Casey, I have a question for you.

32:30.728 --> 32:33.268
What is the square root of pi times ten

32:33.269 --> 32:34.718
divided by the speed of light squared.

32:34.719 --> 32:37.184
- What? I can't answer that! 
- Too bad.

32:38.299 --> 32:40.871
Hey, hey. Nice try, sweetheart.

32:42.146 --> 32:44.007
- It's Evan's turn. 
- Evanilla?

32:44.008 --> 32:45.320
Is there anything you want to ask me?

32:45.321 --> 32:49.253
- Now's your chance.
- Yeah, uh, why are you such a jackass?

32:52.078 --> 32:54.947
I can't answer that.
Looks like we're gonna have to kiss.

32:54.948 --> 32:57.488
Kiss, kiss, kiss! Kiss, kiss, kiss!

32:57.489 --> 32:59.624
I imagined this for so many
years, now I can't even look.

32:59.976 --> 33:01.110
Kiss, kiss, kiss!

33:01.111 --> 33:03.109
All right. Just remember, no tongue!

33:07.524 --> 33:08.961
I said no tongues!

33:09.705 --> 33:10.542
OK, my turn.

33:10.793 --> 33:14.241
Casey, who would you say is better
in the sack, Cappie or Evan?

33:15.923 --> 33:18.248
I'm not going to answer that.

33:18.249 --> 33:20.705
It's Cappie. Just kidding.

33:26.141 --> 33:27.531
Gotta answer the question, Case.

33:29.335 --> 33:33.674
Fine, fine. Um... Cappie.

33:37.781 --> 33:40.947
Um... I want to ask my question to...
Ashleigh.

33:42.251 --> 33:44.172
Are we going to be able to be friends

33:44.173 --> 33:45.370
now that Cappie and I are back together?

33:48.022 --> 33:48.737
The truth?

33:50.401 --> 33:51.830
No, I don't think so.

33:54.867 --> 33:57.768
- Why? 
- Because...

33:57.769 --> 34:00.687
You and Cappie are gonna ride
off into the sunset together

34:00.990 --> 34:01.797
and now you have that

34:01.798 --> 34:03.801
special someone to turn
to and it won't be me.

34:05.236 --> 34:07.350
And yeah, we'll swear
we're gonna stay close,

34:07.351 --> 34:09.741
but we're not that close now
and we both still live here.

34:10.231 --> 34:11.965
We're the real college relationship.

34:12.862 --> 34:14.621
And we all know what happens to those.

34:14.935 --> 34:19.090
- Ash, that is not...
- Your turn is up. Who's next?

34:22.181 --> 34:25.217
Maybe there's someone out
there like that for you.

34:25.464 --> 34:27.154
- Is that a question? 
- Yeah.

34:27.911 --> 34:29.775
Are you really into that professor guy,

34:29.801 --> 34:32.558
or is there someone else
that you have feelings for?

34:32.993 --> 34:35.322
Please. It's obvious the way
they were all over each other...

34:35.322 --> 34:35.992
Kiss.

34:40.674 --> 34:43.543
- Wait, what? 
- What's going on?

34:43.869 --> 34:45.081
Uh, I have no idea.

34:54.559 --> 34:55.833
It was you!

34:58.207 --> 35:00.678
OK. Who's next?

35:01.472 --> 35:03.734
If you need to hurl, I think I
saw a bucket behind the bar.

35:04.065 --> 35:06.857
Shut up, Dale. It's your turn, Rebecca.

35:06.858 --> 35:09.895
- I have a question for Evan. 
- What?

35:10.618 --> 35:14.405
Do you love the law and
law school more than me?

35:15.035 --> 35:18.983
That's a ridiculous question.
No, of course not.

35:19.256 --> 35:20.620
Then why won't you have sex with me?

35:27.407 --> 35:28.996
All right, I'm tired of this stupid game.

35:31.481 --> 35:32.884
You got me to trust you.

35:33.579 --> 35:35.627
You told me that I deserved to be happy,

35:35.628 --> 35:36.908
and that we could be happy together.

35:36.977 --> 35:38.255
But you keep leaving me alone

35:38.256 --> 35:39.448
and making me feel crazy when

35:39.449 --> 35:41.297
I just want to know that
you're there for me.

35:41.298 --> 35:44.983
Maybe, right now, I love law
school a little better than you.

35:44.984 --> 35:47.468
At least law school isn't throwing
itself at me like you did

35:47.469 --> 35:48.739
when I came to pick you up tonight,

35:48.740 --> 35:51.347
and acting all desperate and needy.

35:51.546 --> 35:54.908
Look, I have enough pressure
in my life as it is.

35:54.909 --> 35:57.824
And if you can't deal, that's your problem.

35:59.999 --> 36:03.746
Well, I guess I got my answer.

36:12.100 --> 36:12.852
Nice.

36:20.376 --> 36:23.220
Worst birthday ever.

36:28.750 --> 36:30.933
I can't believe I wasted
so much time on that jerk.

36:31.759 --> 36:33.798
You sure you don't want some toilet paper?

36:35.965 --> 36:37.378
He doesn't deserve my tears.

36:40.489 --> 36:42.718
- Rebecca, I really think...
- If you're gonna defend him

36:42.719 --> 36:44.666
and tell me to take a
backseat to law school,

36:45.220 --> 36:46.292
you can leave this bathroom.

36:48.145 --> 36:49.925
I was going to say you're right.

36:49.926 --> 36:52.133
Your instincts are telling
you that you deserve better.

36:52.507 --> 36:53.566
And you do.

36:56.615 --> 36:57.350
She's right.

37:02.890 --> 37:05.022
Thanks for...

37:07.075 --> 37:07.933
the girl talk.

37:18.086 --> 37:18.924
Wait.

37:22.027 --> 37:25.142
I'm sorry about all that stuff
I said during our fight.

37:25.613 --> 37:26.597
But how could you think we're a

37:26.598 --> 37:28.598
college relationship?
We're like Sex and the City.

37:28.692 --> 37:30.693
Yeah, I know it's a worn-out franchise,

37:30.694 --> 37:31.718
and they're not real people.

37:31.983 --> 37:34.185
But Carrie and Miranda and
Charlotte and Samantha

37:34.186 --> 37:36.340
are each other's soul mates.

37:38.904 --> 37:40.272
And you'll always be mine.

37:41.039 --> 37:42.465
With or without Cappie.

37:45.038 --> 37:46.825
And you'll always be my soul mate.

37:48.798 --> 37:51.281
And it's not a worn-out franchise.
I even liked the second movie.

37:51.282 --> 37:52.843
- Me, too! 
- OK, good.

37:54.824 --> 37:57.249
Oh, my God, I missed you so much!

37:57.250 --> 37:59.369
There were so many crazy things
I wanted to tell you about!

37:59.370 --> 38:01.333
Me, too! I got drunk after our

38:01.334 --> 38:02.903
fight and then I had
unprotected sex with Cappie!

38:02.904 --> 38:04.765
- And I had to take the morning-after pill.
- Oh, my God!

38:04.766 --> 38:07.238
- I know!
- Then I started dating your professor!

38:07.239 --> 38:09.731
- And then I kissed Rusty!
- I know, just now, in Kiss or Tell!

38:09.732 --> 38:12.623
No, I mean I kissed him for real
the night before Homecoming!

38:13.377 --> 38:17.049
- What?
- No, no, let's keep talking like this.

38:17.050 --> 38:18.418
It makes it sound so much better.

38:18.419 --> 38:20.368
Wait. You kissed Rusty for real?

38:21.436 --> 38:25.390
Yeah. It was, um...
It was right after our fight.

38:25.804 --> 38:30.052
And he was so sweet. And really drunk.

38:30.671 --> 38:33.542
And it just kind of happened.

38:34.961 --> 38:36.843
What about Segal? I was just

38:36.844 --> 38:38.531
starting to get less weirded-out about him.

38:38.532 --> 38:40.685
I like him. But with Rusty, it's just...

38:41.273 --> 38:44.263
- Do you like him? 
- I...

38:45.237 --> 38:48.318
I don't know! I mean, he's Rusty.
He's your brother.

38:48.319 --> 38:49.627
Yeah, he's my little brother.

38:50.246 --> 38:52.801
And even though he frequently
annoys the crap out of me,

38:52.802 --> 38:53.835
I have to protect him.

38:54.246 --> 38:55.986
You can't go messing with
him unless you're sure.

39:09.779 --> 39:13.421
Rebecca, look, I'm sorry
tonight got so screwed up.

39:14.683 --> 39:15.799
OK? But can't we just admit

39:15.800 --> 39:18.632
we've both made some mistakes and move on?

39:22.308 --> 39:23.830
I haven't made any mistakes.

39:26.590 --> 39:28.928
- Except trusting you.
- You can still trust me.

39:31.443 --> 39:34.491
It's too late. I deserve better.

39:35.830 --> 39:37.157
Even Casey thinks so.

39:40.572 --> 39:42.212
What does Casey have to do with this?

39:44.456 --> 39:46.228
Blow on it again. Here we go.

39:48.923 --> 39:52.952
Yes! I win again! Correction, KT wins!

39:54.142 --> 39:54.940
Dang it!

39:55.716 --> 39:58.207
I mean, it must have been the
alcohol throwing my game off.

39:58.208 --> 40:01.442
- It is called Beer Pong, Dale. 
- Man...

40:04.498 --> 40:05.300
Hey, Ash.

40:06.407 --> 40:08.218
Can we talk for a second?

40:10.695 --> 40:14.128
So... it was you I kissed at Homecoming.

40:14.129 --> 40:15.387
And I've been having this

40:15.388 --> 40:18.320
feeling there's something
happening between us...

40:18.321 --> 40:19.673
So I'm ready to answer your question.

40:24.233 --> 40:25.776
Yes, I'm really into Simon.

40:26.813 --> 40:30.492
So... there's nothing happening between us.

40:31.453 --> 40:32.907
- But the kiss... 
- That was

40:32.908 --> 40:34.736
just one of those things
you do when you're drunk.

40:36.994 --> 40:39.292
So if I said or did anything

40:39.620 --> 40:42.394
to make you think otherwise,
then I'm really, really sorry.

40:44.638 --> 40:46.934
So... I must've misread it.

40:48.429 --> 40:49.462
Yeah, I guess so.

40:51.010 --> 40:52.222
OK, so...

40:55.455 --> 40:58.480
Well, I just want you to be happy.

41:01.503 --> 41:04.599
- OK. So, friends? 
- Absolutely.

41:05.556 --> 41:06.303
Friends.

41:22.640 --> 41:25.252
- What was that for?
- I'm happy we're together.

41:25.742 --> 41:29.197
And you know what? So is Ash. We made up.

41:29.579 --> 41:32.435
Well, go make up again so we
can kick this up a notch.

41:35.492 --> 41:37.586
Where do you get off telling
Rebecca to break up with me?

41:37.587 --> 41:38.966
I didn't tell her to break up with you.

41:38.984 --> 41:40.638
I told her that she deserves better

41:40.639 --> 41:42.504
than the way you've been treating her.
And I stand by that.

41:42.505 --> 41:43.769
Well, your little empowerment

41:43.770 --> 41:45.839
seminar cost me my relationship, Case.

41:45.840 --> 41:48.966
Uh, actually, you cost yourself
that relationship, Chambers.

41:49.736 --> 41:51.113
Just watch your back in law school.

41:51.114 --> 41:52.179
'Cause now the gloves are off.

41:58.269 --> 41:59.630
Anybody want some cake?

42:00.600 --> 42:01.833
Actually, um...

42:03.430 --> 42:04.916
You left it at the apartment, didn't you?

42:04.917 --> 42:05.459
Yes.

42:10.127 --> 42:11.238
Blow out the candles!

42:11.613 --> 42:13.381
And wish this night never happened.

42:14.539 --> 42:16.086
Well, thanks, guys.

42:16.087 --> 42:19.049
Uh... some of you have been
good friends for a while.

42:20.005 --> 42:22.583
Uh, some of you, I've just
gotten closer to recently.

42:23.226 --> 42:25.976
And some of you, I don't really know.

42:27.584 --> 42:28.668
We'll fix that.

42:29.913 --> 42:33.334
You know, most people barely
remember their 21st birthday.

42:33.910 --> 42:37.458
This will be one I will never forget.

42:41.792 --> 42:43.308
Don't forget to make a wish!

42:47.266 --> 42:48.599
Happy birthday.

43:11.544 --> 43:12.716
Good morning.

43:14.436 --> 43:15.809
And you're fired.
