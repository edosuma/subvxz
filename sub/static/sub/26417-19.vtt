00:01.327 --> 00:03.394
As you all know, I
have recently enrolled

00:03.395 --> 00:05.324
in Orlando State University's

00:05.325 --> 00:08.817
prestigious school
administration program.

00:10.425 --> 00:11.892
I was holding for applause.

00:14.055 --> 00:16.673
Thank you, thank you. You're too kind.

00:16.674 --> 00:19.126
It's time this bird flew back to school

00:19.127 --> 00:21.962
to become the teacher-boss
she was always meant to be.

00:21.963 --> 00:23.827
I won't be around as
much, but don't worry.

00:23.828 --> 00:26.485
I will be leaving you
in very capable hands.

00:26.486 --> 00:30.954
Everybody, please give your full
attention and respect to...

00:30.955 --> 00:32.204
Evan.

00:34.809 --> 00:36.977
Thank you. It's an honor.

00:36.978 --> 00:38.578
Evan's in charge? But what about Dad?

00:38.579 --> 00:39.746
Oh, well, I can't be in charge

00:39.747 --> 00:41.314
'cause I'm too busy
running the restaurant.

00:41.315 --> 00:42.549
Yes, that's exactly it.

00:43.351 --> 00:46.953
I have appointed Evan to the
position of Vice Mommy.

00:46.954 --> 00:49.289
Vice Mommy? Sounds like a made-up job.

00:49.290 --> 00:51.791
Well, "Emery" sounds like
a made-up name, so...

00:53.327 --> 00:56.029
Vice Mommy, the floor is yours.

01:00.414 --> 01:02.552
I want to work with you, not at you,

01:02.553 --> 01:04.304
so, please, for the love of God,

01:04.305 --> 01:05.738
work with me.

01:06.875 --> 01:08.775
I don't hear applause.

but promise me you'll
eat your carrots first.

01:35.119 --> 01:36.286
Yes, Vice Mommy.

01:37.488 --> 01:39.289
Wait, did you...

01:39.290 --> 01:41.524
Hide Dad's purple tie so he
doesn't waste 15 minutes

01:41.525 --> 01:43.193
debating if he can pull it off? Yes.

01:43.194 --> 01:44.394
Good. Did you...

01:44.395 --> 01:45.628
Clean the hair out of the drain

01:45.629 --> 01:47.530
so Emery doesn't think
it's a shower rat?

01:47.531 --> 01:49.065
No. He needs to learn.

01:49.066 --> 01:50.133
Yes.

01:50.134 --> 01:51.634
He must be braver.

01:51.635 --> 01:54.137
I guess I'm just nervous.

01:54.138 --> 01:57.106
As the roaring engine of
the Huang family machine,

01:57.107 --> 01:59.976
I'm afraid things will
fall apart without me.

01:59.977 --> 02:01.978
Maybe I should just stay home,

02:01.979 --> 02:03.513
put school off for another year...

02:03.514 --> 02:04.514
or 10.

02:04.515 --> 02:06.349
Woman! That's crazy talk!

02:06.350 --> 02:07.550
This is your dream!

02:07.551 --> 02:10.152
I know, but what if Eddie
forgets to pack for Taiwan

02:10.154 --> 02:11.854
or Grandma succeeds in
throwing that party

02:11.855 --> 02:13.690
she's been threatening
to throw for two years?

02:13.691 --> 02:15.558
Relax. I've got you covered.

02:15.559 --> 02:17.760
I've even scheduled Vice Mommy Reports,

02:17.761 --> 02:19.495
or "VMRs."

02:19.496 --> 02:22.198
Each night, we'll decompress
over a game of Scrabble,

02:22.199 --> 02:24.434
and I'll fill you in on
news from the home front.

02:24.435 --> 02:25.868
Sounds good.

02:25.869 --> 02:27.804
Sprinkle in some current events, too.

02:27.805 --> 02:28.905
I like to be informed.

02:28.906 --> 02:30.340
Come on. You'll miss the bus.

02:30.341 --> 02:31.841
I'm driving.

02:31.842 --> 02:33.810
They grow up so fast.

02:33.811 --> 02:35.545
Thank you, Evan.

02:35.546 --> 02:37.547
I don't know what I'd do without you.

02:38.549 --> 02:39.866
Don't even think about it.

02:41.403 --> 02:44.187
Why are you such a bummer?

02:44.188 --> 02:46.022
Because things are changing around here.

02:46.023 --> 02:47.457
A lesser boy may be worried

02:47.458 --> 02:50.093
about losing his mommy
to school, but not me.

02:50.094 --> 02:52.328
I'm gonna make sure
everything runs perfectly

02:52.329 --> 02:54.981
so that Mommy will have more
than enough time for me.

02:54.983 --> 02:58.073
_

02:58.075 --> 02:59.305
I'll take that as a compliment.

02:59.306 --> 03:00.364
Now, please,

03:00.365 --> 03:02.772
turn around and count to 30
so I can hide the phone.

03:08.196 --> 03:09.379
Hey, delivery boy,

03:09.380 --> 03:11.178
these guys may look like regular cans,

03:11.179 --> 03:12.782
but they're all secretly wallets.

03:12.783 --> 03:14.284
You can borrow 'em for your trip.

03:14.285 --> 03:16.119
Oh, thanks!

03:16.120 --> 03:18.354
But I'll respectfully pass
on "Sensitive Skin" here.

03:18.355 --> 03:20.823
Don't want thieves thinking I
can't handle a normal shave.

03:20.824 --> 03:22.091
Oh, man.

03:22.092 --> 03:24.780
I can't believe you're traveling
abroad, all by yourself.

03:24.781 --> 03:27.196
Yeah, I'm pretty stoked for
this cultural exchange program.

03:27.197 --> 03:28.631
I feel worldly and mature,

03:28.632 --> 03:30.566
like I just tried sushi
for the first time.

03:30.567 --> 03:31.934
And you're not freaked out at all?

03:31.935 --> 03:33.503
Taiwan's pretty far away.

03:33.504 --> 03:34.971
Like, farther than England.

03:34.972 --> 03:36.423
The only thing I'm nervous about

03:36.424 --> 03:39.225
is asking Tina to be my
girlfriend before I go.

03:39.226 --> 03:41.778
She challenged me to improve
myself, and I think I have.

03:41.779 --> 03:43.496
I noticed you've been
carrying around a hanky.

03:43.497 --> 03:45.081
Oh, my gentleman's napkin?

03:45.082 --> 03:46.099
Yeah.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.393
I think I'm ready to ask her out.

03:47.394 --> 03:48.438
I'd say so.

03:48.439 --> 03:50.837
You and my sister going
steady... how thrilling.

03:50.838 --> 03:52.639
Have you picked out the pin? Can I see?

03:52.640 --> 03:53.456
The pin?

03:53.457 --> 03:55.892
To make it official, my dad says
you have to offer up a pin.

03:55.893 --> 03:57.377
I keep one on me at all times.

03:58.246 --> 03:59.546
Oh, crap.

03:59.547 --> 04:01.848
Is this another one of the old
man's antiquated customs?

04:01.849 --> 04:03.083
Until last year, I thought

04:03.084 --> 04:04.851
every family practiced
hiding underground

04:04.852 --> 04:06.803
in case the Ruskis get any ideas.

04:08.089 --> 04:11.607
Gather 'round, Cattlemen and women!

04:11.608 --> 04:14.043
It is that time of the month.

04:14.044 --> 04:17.096
Uh, I mean, it's Employee
of the Month time.

04:17.098 --> 04:19.358
Now, the winner of this month's award

04:19.358 --> 04:21.334
is clearly driven.

04:22.070 --> 04:24.454
He's had this in the bag.

04:24.455 --> 04:26.251
He never phones it in,

04:26.252 --> 04:29.459
but you can always count
on him to deliver.

04:29.460 --> 04:31.378
I wonder who it is!

04:31.379 --> 04:32.579
The winner is...

04:32.580 --> 04:34.381
my baby boy...

04:34.382 --> 04:35.348
Who is it?

04:35.349 --> 04:36.716
You still don't get it?

04:37.491 --> 04:39.857
...Eddie!

04:40.755 --> 04:42.677
Huh. Must be nice to be the boss' son.

04:44.449 --> 04:45.942
Uh, Dad, thanks, but I don't want you

04:45.943 --> 04:48.111
to give me special treatment
just because I'm your son.

04:48.112 --> 04:49.396
No, there's no special treatment.

04:49.397 --> 04:51.064
You earned this fair and square.

04:51.065 --> 04:52.766
I can't help it if my little boy

04:52.767 --> 04:55.225
is killing it at his big, grown-up job!

04:57.087 --> 04:59.939
Wow, our first Asian
Employee of the Month.

04:59.940 --> 05:01.324
What took so long, Louis?

05:01.325 --> 05:03.276
Sat on my pin!

05:03.277 --> 05:05.545
Don't you dare tell anyone
I'm dating my butt.

05:07.916 --> 05:12.652
I'm adding an "I-V-E."

05:12.653 --> 05:13.920
"Productive"!

05:13.921 --> 05:15.855
Which is what I've been
while you were at school.

05:17.125 --> 05:18.625
Is this really your best work?

05:18.626 --> 05:20.777
- Yeah.
- Okay.

05:20.778 --> 05:23.179
If you think it's your best
work, then I believe you.

05:28.736 --> 05:31.571
Mm. These definitely
aren't worker hands.

05:31.572 --> 05:32.832
Smooth as the city.

05:33.675 --> 05:35.341
Sorry. It's what Mommy would say.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.978
So, uh, a li'l birdie told me

05:38.979 --> 05:40.596
you were making it official with Tina.

05:40.597 --> 05:42.982
Let me guess. Is this li'l
birdie dating his own butt?

05:43.818 --> 05:44.818
Ah, ah, ah!

05:44.819 --> 05:47.366
Personal conversations after chores.

05:50.859 --> 05:52.625
Pretty good job, right?

05:53.828 --> 05:55.128
Mommy?

05:55.129 --> 05:56.362
This is our time.

05:56.363 --> 05:59.733
- I'm totally listening. What's up?
- Something wrong?

05:59.734 --> 06:02.051
You played "sad" and didn't
make anything plural.

06:02.052 --> 06:03.920
I'm thinking about school.

06:03.921 --> 06:06.005
Oh. I see.

06:06.006 --> 06:08.508
I got a B on my first assignment.

06:08.509 --> 06:10.495
Not you! You're an A-plus Mommy!

06:10.496 --> 06:12.781
- How did this happen?!
- I don't know!

06:12.782 --> 06:15.038
I'm doing my best, and
the professor loves me.

06:15.039 --> 06:16.566
I mean, can you blame her?

06:16.567 --> 06:18.634
Well, what can I do to help?

06:18.635 --> 06:20.234
I am your Vice Mommy, after all.

06:20.235 --> 06:21.927
And you're doing a great job.

06:22.690 --> 06:24.593
I'm sure I'll figure it out.

06:24.595 --> 06:26.514
I think I'm gonna turn in.

06:26.516 --> 06:28.033
We'll just call this a tie.

06:30.164 --> 06:31.564
A tie?

06:33.567 --> 06:36.369
So, I don't need a big party.

06:36.370 --> 06:39.322
What if I invite, like,
oh, four friends over?

06:39.323 --> 06:40.556
We stay in my room.

06:40.557 --> 06:42.124
My friends are cool.

06:42.125 --> 06:43.409
We'll keep it chill.

06:43.410 --> 06:44.377
Not now.

06:44.378 --> 06:45.478
I'm losing Mommy time

06:45.479 --> 06:47.180
because she's not doing well in school.

06:47.181 --> 06:48.667
I wish she would just let me help.

06:48.668 --> 06:50.550
You? Help?

06:50.551 --> 06:52.368
What you going to do, huh?

06:52.369 --> 06:54.621
Stow away in her backpack?

06:57.024 --> 06:59.642
Ah. Toasted.

07:03.831 --> 07:06.632
Big tips tonight. Look close.
You might even see a Lincoln.

07:07.635 --> 07:08.868
What the hell?

07:10.138 --> 07:11.596
Whew! Quite a load.

07:11.597 --> 07:13.789
You got your nickel's
worth out of that diaper.

07:13.790 --> 07:15.611
The whole staff signed it
to wish you a good trip!

07:15.612 --> 07:17.510
- Do you like it?
- No! I hate it!

07:17.511 --> 07:19.145
I-I'm not wearing pants
in some of these.

07:19.146 --> 07:20.928
Oh, come on. You're adorable!

07:20.929 --> 07:22.965
Look at those tender baby-boy thighs.

07:22.966 --> 07:24.700
Don't call me "baby boy"!

07:24.701 --> 07:26.019
Chad can totally hear us.

07:26.020 --> 07:30.423
Just look busy, like
you can't even hear.

07:30.424 --> 07:32.441
Listen, you're doing so great at work,

07:32.442 --> 07:34.460
and you're about to
travel abroad all alone.

07:34.461 --> 07:35.795
I can't help but be proud.

07:35.796 --> 07:36.963
Fine, but that doesn't mean

07:36.964 --> 07:39.198
you need to broadcast
your feelings at work.

07:39.199 --> 07:41.968
Just... act like my boss, please.

07:41.969 --> 07:43.970
I'm nothing if not boss-like.

07:43.971 --> 07:45.405
Well, most bosses don't have access

07:45.406 --> 07:46.874
to their employees' baby pictures.

07:46.875 --> 07:49.976
Please, just leave your dad hat at home.

07:50.912 --> 07:53.012
No more special treatment.

07:53.013 --> 07:55.615
I'm your employee here. That's it.

07:56.551 --> 07:59.235
But you bought me Springsteen
tickets for Father's Day!

07:59.236 --> 08:00.836
The Boss on Father's Day?

08:00.837 --> 08:02.288
You started this confusion!

08:02.289 --> 08:04.273
If we're changing our
Employee of the Month photos,

08:04.274 --> 08:06.325
I'd love to use one where
my eyes aren't so open.

08:08.096 --> 08:10.582
I'd also love a few weeks
so I can get a tan.

08:14.551 --> 08:17.236
Just so you know, none
of these are plastic.

08:17.237 --> 08:18.454
Thank you, Jessica.

08:18.455 --> 08:20.356
With this harvest, I won't
have to visit the doctor

08:20.357 --> 08:21.524
for at least a month.

08:23.360 --> 08:26.555
Oh, that's a very good joke, Professor.

08:26.556 --> 08:30.066
Let's remember this
happy feeling always.

08:30.067 --> 08:31.717
You know, especially come grading time.

08:36.758 --> 08:38.159
'Scuse me.

08:38.159 --> 08:39.318
Is this seat taken?

08:39.320 --> 08:41.198
- Evan?
- That's right.

08:41.198 --> 08:42.977
There's a new big man on campus,

08:42.977 --> 08:44.637
and he's little.

08:48.438 --> 08:50.583
Evan, this is grown-up school.

08:50.584 --> 08:51.889
Kids aren't allowed here.

08:51.890 --> 08:53.474
It's okay. I'm only here to help.

08:53.475 --> 08:54.642
I'm an excellent student.

08:54.643 --> 08:56.311
Is this a friend of yours?

08:56.312 --> 08:59.230
Each joke funnier than the last.

08:59.231 --> 09:01.115
- Mm.
- Evan Huang.

09:01.116 --> 09:02.951
Believe it or not, this
young lady right here

09:02.952 --> 09:03.918
is my mother.

09:03.919 --> 09:05.586
Good genes. What can I say?

09:06.322 --> 09:09.824
Sorry to impose, but we had
some childcare issues.

09:09.825 --> 09:11.676
It's so hard to find
good help these days.

09:11.677 --> 09:12.727
Isn't it, though?

09:12.728 --> 09:14.395
Is it all right if I stay?

09:14.396 --> 09:16.064
I have some... coloring to catch up on.

09:16.065 --> 09:17.248
You won't even know I'm here.

09:17.249 --> 09:19.016
I don't see why not.

09:26.676 --> 09:29.026
I'm afraid my class
load is far too great

09:29.027 --> 09:30.742
for me to hold office hours.

09:30.743 --> 09:34.549
Instead, uh, you all know
my T.A., Burt Palouska.

09:34.550 --> 09:36.951
"Professor too busy.

09:36.952 --> 09:39.487
Needs help from Burt Papusa."

09:39.488 --> 09:41.639
Burt is more than willing to help.

09:41.640 --> 09:44.375
He is going to pass out a
sign-up sheet right now.

09:44.376 --> 09:47.178
A little bit about me...
My full name is Ferburt.

09:47.179 --> 09:48.713
I am not a family man.

09:48.714 --> 09:49.697
I do have s...

09:49.698 --> 09:51.182
Burt, the sign-up sheet.

09:51.183 --> 09:52.300
Oh. Right.

09:54.537 --> 09:56.537
Oh, no, thanks. You're
not the real teacher.

09:57.540 --> 09:59.006
Oh.

10:01.911 --> 10:03.444
Bingo.

10:07.784 --> 10:10.385
I didn't realize this trip
required so much shaving.

10:10.386 --> 10:12.503
Oh, my travel cans? They're
all secretly wallets.

10:12.504 --> 10:13.754
I stored all my money in them.

10:15.792 --> 10:17.909
Emery, you're supposedly
good with ladies, right?

10:17.910 --> 10:19.210
This is supposedly true.

10:19.211 --> 10:20.247
Well, let me ask you.

10:20.248 --> 10:21.763
If I wanted to impress Tina,

10:21.764 --> 10:23.547
would cooking her a romantic
dinner be a good idea?

10:23.548 --> 10:24.673
That's a great idea.

10:24.674 --> 10:26.817
She'll melt just like
butter on top of...

10:26.818 --> 10:27.952
some hot food.

10:28.804 --> 10:29.954
You know, the person

10:29.955 --> 10:31.606
you should be thinking
about is your boss.

10:31.607 --> 10:33.391
Have you told him about your trip?

10:33.392 --> 10:34.509
Dad, you know about my trip.

10:34.510 --> 10:36.483
Oh, yes, I know about your trip,

10:36.484 --> 10:38.012
but your boss doesn't.

10:38.013 --> 10:39.013
I'm lost.

10:39.014 --> 10:41.365
Did a famous musician take
over Cattleman's again?

10:41.366 --> 10:44.719
Well, since we're at home,
I have my dad hat on.

10:44.720 --> 10:47.121
Allow me to give you
some fatherly advice.

10:47.122 --> 10:48.536
Whenever you take a trip,

10:48.537 --> 10:50.496
you always need to check in at work,

10:50.497 --> 10:53.027
fill out the proper
time-off forms, et cetera.

10:53.028 --> 10:54.128
For real?

10:54.129 --> 10:55.263
For real.

10:55.264 --> 10:57.815
You said you didn't want
any special treatment.

10:59.168 --> 11:01.335
Ew. All your money's wet.

11:02.638 --> 11:05.067
Wow. College is like
the Wild, Wild West.

11:05.068 --> 11:07.442
People coming and going
without bathroom passes.

11:07.443 --> 11:08.843
Somebody had a computer.

11:08.844 --> 11:10.828
There was a girl who could
sit on her own hair.

11:10.829 --> 11:12.246
Ugh. Denise.

11:12.247 --> 11:14.449
When she buns it up, I
can't see the board.

11:14.450 --> 11:16.701
Well, it was so great
spending the day together.

11:16.702 --> 11:18.925
And also, I figured out your problem.

11:18.926 --> 11:20.955
- It's Burt.
- What's Burt?

11:20.956 --> 11:23.191
The T.A. He holds the key to your A.

11:23.192 --> 11:25.041
Guy who turns on the projector?

11:25.042 --> 11:27.979
Yeah. He's also the one
who grades the papers

11:27.980 --> 11:29.297
and does all the grunt work

11:29.298 --> 11:31.032
while the professor
soaks in all the glory.

11:31.033 --> 11:32.840
He's the wind beneath her wings.

11:32.841 --> 11:34.994
Exactly. So you need to win him over.

11:34.995 --> 11:37.507
Go to his office hours. Invite
him over here to dinner.

11:37.508 --> 11:40.545
And together, we'll charm him
all the way to A-Plus Town.

11:40.546 --> 11:41.792
Or, better yet...

11:41.793 --> 11:43.751
- A-Plus City.
- Mm.

11:43.752 --> 11:46.113
It's like a town, but with
more people and more crime.

11:48.564 --> 11:50.701
There comes a time in
every young man's life

11:50.702 --> 11:52.420
when he's faced with the question...

11:52.421 --> 11:54.922
Are you gonna beat this
duck à l'orange recipe,

11:54.923 --> 11:57.842
or are you gonna let this duck
à l'orange recipe beat you?

11:57.843 --> 11:58.861
Scoot over, li'l bro.

11:58.862 --> 12:00.713
I gotta cook for my would-be
lady before I leave.

12:00.714 --> 12:02.924
- Work my culinary magic.
- Sorry, can't.

12:02.925 --> 12:05.182
I need the kitchen so I
can dazzle Burt Papusa.

12:05.183 --> 12:06.701
Who the hell is Burt Papusa?

12:06.702 --> 12:09.238
I don't have time to explain
who everyone is to you!

12:09.820 --> 12:11.394
If you look at the family schedule,

12:11.395 --> 12:13.674
you'll see that I have
reserved the kitchen.

12:13.675 --> 12:16.844
As Vice Mommy, I'm gonna have
to insist that you leave.

12:16.845 --> 12:18.532
You're gonna have to
find another kitchen

12:18.533 --> 12:20.331
for your little flirt fest.

12:20.332 --> 12:21.805
What is going on in this house?

12:21.806 --> 12:23.911
You're the mom, Dad's the boss,

12:23.912 --> 12:25.840
and Grandma asked me to
drive her to get a keg.

12:25.841 --> 12:27.371
Please tell me you didn't.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.607
Relax. She refused to put a
deposit down on the tap,

12:29.608 --> 12:30.908
so we just turned around.

12:34.097 --> 12:35.906
Damn, girl! You finished
that whole steak!

12:36.966 --> 12:38.833
What was that? Come on, Huang!

12:38.834 --> 12:40.219
You're trying to ask this girl out!

12:40.220 --> 12:42.498
I'm just messing with you.

12:42.499 --> 12:44.463
You're damn right I
ate that whole steak!

12:44.464 --> 12:46.389
I always finish what I start.

12:46.390 --> 12:47.825
I'm not afraid of commitment.

12:47.826 --> 12:49.586
Oh, man, she's giving you nothing.

12:49.587 --> 12:51.095
You're just gonna have to go for it.

12:51.096 --> 12:52.897
Um, look, Tina.

12:52.898 --> 12:54.701
I have something I want to ask.

12:54.702 --> 12:55.942
What's all this?

12:56.535 --> 12:57.886
Hey, Mr. Huang.

12:58.603 --> 13:00.171
Tina. Always a pleasure.

13:00.172 --> 13:02.139
Ooh, clean plate club. Nice.

13:02.140 --> 13:03.661
Eddie, a word, please?

13:04.622 --> 13:07.128
Dad, you just interrupted
my romantic moment.

13:07.129 --> 13:09.346
Look, no one wants you and
Tina together more than me,

13:09.347 --> 13:11.582
but you used the work
kitchen without permission.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.935
If you were any other
employee, you'd be fired.

13:13.936 --> 13:16.237
See, Evan kicked me out, so
I had to find another...

13:16.238 --> 13:17.259
Stop right there.

13:17.260 --> 13:18.973
We're at work. I have my boss hat on.

13:18.974 --> 13:21.142
I can't get in the middle
of your family drama.

13:21.143 --> 13:22.531
Come on, Dad. You're
taking this too far.

13:22.532 --> 13:24.218
You're the one who wanted
to draw these lines,

13:24.219 --> 13:26.230
but only when it was convenient for you.

13:26.231 --> 13:27.882
Clean the kitchen... now!

13:27.883 --> 13:29.783
I should let you get back to work.

13:30.541 --> 13:31.919
Um, I'll walk you out.

13:31.920 --> 13:33.821
It's fine. Do your thing.

13:33.822 --> 13:35.148
I'll see you later, okay?

13:39.144 --> 13:41.112
Thanks a lot, boss.

13:48.424 --> 13:49.687
It was worth the battle

13:49.688 --> 13:52.123
to get Mommy to buy these butter knives.

13:54.126 --> 13:55.826
Evan, your plan worked.

13:55.827 --> 13:56.994
Oh, it did?

13:56.995 --> 13:58.262
What a surprise!

13:58.263 --> 14:00.998
Burt was thrilled that I
attended his office hours.

14:00.999 --> 14:02.700
Yes. I love it.

14:02.701 --> 14:05.269
Where is that son of a gun?
My duck's getting cold.

14:05.270 --> 14:07.004
Oh, change of plans.

14:07.005 --> 14:09.143
Burt invited me to join his study group

14:09.145 --> 14:10.307
that meets tonight!

14:10.308 --> 14:12.076
So, he's not coming for dinner?

14:12.077 --> 14:13.277
No.

14:13.278 --> 14:15.112
But the duck looks great, though.

14:15.113 --> 14:17.181
You keep cooking like
this for the family,

14:17.182 --> 14:18.749
you're gonna make me look bad.

14:18.750 --> 14:20.484
Wait!

14:20.485 --> 14:22.419
We still need to do our VMR.

14:23.044 --> 14:25.222
Oh, you don't have to do
those for me anymore.

14:25.223 --> 14:27.107
I know you have
everything under control.

14:29.094 --> 14:30.694
Hey, Julia Child.

14:30.695 --> 14:33.236
I'm taking this guy back to my room.

14:36.675 --> 14:38.642
Maybe a fun party

14:38.643 --> 14:40.711
will turn your frown upside-down?

14:40.713 --> 14:43.047
I can't believe my plan backfired.

14:43.048 --> 14:45.183
Instead of securing
more time with Mommy,

14:45.184 --> 14:48.319
I've pushed her into the
waiting arms of Burt Papusa.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.840
Aren't you going to ask
who Burt Papusa is?

14:52.841 --> 14:54.843
I assume he's a wrestler.

14:54.845 --> 14:57.463
Well, he's wrestled Mommy away
from me. That's for sure.

14:57.464 --> 15:00.266
As long as you're taking
care of everything here,

15:00.267 --> 15:04.570
she will be free to focus on
wrestling her new friends.

15:07.914 --> 15:09.047
You're right!

15:09.049 --> 15:11.384
Maybe I've been going
about this the wrong way.

15:11.386 --> 15:14.647
Maybe you and I can
both get what we want.

15:15.683 --> 15:17.971
Listen, I'm not gonna tell
you where the phone is,

15:17.972 --> 15:19.210
but I will tell you

15:19.211 --> 15:21.854
it's somewhere that rhymes with "coven."

15:23.324 --> 15:24.740
Hmm.

15:24.741 --> 15:25.958
"Coven."

15:26.961 --> 15:28.060
Oh!

15:30.765 --> 15:32.978
Oven. It's in the oven. I
hid the phone in the oven.

15:36.753 --> 15:38.854
Here's my leave-of-absence
paperwork for Cattleman's.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.042
Dad said I should give it to you.

15:40.043 --> 15:41.323
Do we have to do this here?

15:41.324 --> 15:43.042
I like to keep work and school separate.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.778
- Not you, too!
- Whoa! Easy, cowboy.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.313
Tell your old pal Trent what's wrong.

15:47.314 --> 15:49.076
I asked my dad to respect my boundaries,

15:49.077 --> 15:50.442
and now he's being a tyrant.

15:50.443 --> 15:53.235
A tyrant? That doesn't sound
like the Louis I know and love.

15:53.236 --> 15:54.287
Don't take his side!

15:54.288 --> 15:56.489
Oh, sorry. This is awkward for me.

15:56.490 --> 15:58.190
I'm really good friends with you both.

15:58.191 --> 16:00.126
You have to admit we
wouldn't be in this fight

16:00.127 --> 16:02.295
if he didn't lay on the
special treatment so thick.

16:02.296 --> 16:04.897
Eddie, you're not the only one
who gets special treatment.

16:04.898 --> 16:06.799
Remember when I made the honor roll

16:06.800 --> 16:08.167
and he named that dessert after me?

16:08.168 --> 16:09.569
Trent-a-misu? Yeah.

16:09.570 --> 16:10.970
And when Hector adopted that cat?

16:11.584 --> 16:14.523
♪ Happy Meow Day to you ♪

16:14.524 --> 16:16.809

employees like family.

16:21.431 --> 16:22.765
I feel terrible.

16:22.766 --> 16:24.688
I just got so self-conscious
when Hector said,

16:24.689 --> 16:26.586
"Must be nice to be the boss' son."

16:26.587 --> 16:28.882
Oh. He meant that literally.
Don't feel bad.

16:28.883 --> 16:31.140
Hector's a puzzle I've been
trying to solve for months.

16:31.141 --> 16:33.159
Wow. And you're really
good at puzzles, too.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.405

You guys know you can
smoke in here, huh?

16:53.964 --> 16:56.799
I don't care. I live in the garage!

Jenny, I have told you a
thousand times... No parties!

17:03.861 --> 17:05.961

17:06.292 --> 17:08.260
I'll deal with you later. Where's Evan?

17:08.261 --> 17:09.363
I'm over here.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.525
Evan!

17:14.526 --> 17:17.069
You were supposed to be
in charge. What happened?

17:17.069 --> 17:20.373
I tried to stop her, but I
only have so much power.

17:20.374 --> 17:21.807
I'm just Vice Mommy.

17:21.808 --> 17:24.742
Don't you take that
matronizing tone with me.

17:26.445 --> 17:28.097
Okay, party's over!

17:28.098 --> 17:29.507
Everybody out!

17:40.176 --> 17:42.962

Eddie, I don't remember giving
you permission to ring Gertie.

17:45.474 --> 17:46.598
It'll be worth it. Trust me.

17:47.453 --> 17:48.901
I'd like to start by saying

17:48.902 --> 17:51.037
I had the Huang attitude
about Employee of the Month.

17:51.038 --> 17:54.006
"Huang" is a substitute for
"wrong." Nice wordplay.

17:54.007 --> 17:55.307
I would like to take this opportunity

17:55.308 --> 17:56.909
to formally apologize
to a special someone.

17:56.910 --> 17:59.595
If he was a city, he'd be St. Louis.

17:59.596 --> 18:00.663
Is it me?

18:00.664 --> 18:02.014
Where are you going with this, Eddie?

18:02.015 --> 18:03.896
I'm sorry I was such a jerk before.

18:03.897 --> 18:05.768
You're not only the
best dad in the world,

18:05.769 --> 18:07.102
you're also the best boss.

18:08.138 --> 18:09.521
So, with your blessing,

18:09.522 --> 18:11.840
I would like to re-accept
Employee of the Month,

18:11.841 --> 18:13.158
but under one condition.

18:13.690 --> 18:15.327
That you share it with me.

18:18.666 --> 18:20.099
I'd be honored.

18:24.602 --> 18:27.039
Sorry I went overboard
with the baby pictures.

18:27.040 --> 18:29.341
I've just really enjoyed
you working here,

18:29.342 --> 18:31.360
and I wanted to make
sure you knew how I felt

18:31.361 --> 18:32.728
before you left for Taiwan.

18:32.729 --> 18:34.013
I always know how you feel,

18:34.014 --> 18:35.681
embarrassing special treatment or not.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.733
Well, shall we get back to it?

18:37.734 --> 18:39.334
Sure, but I have one more favor.

18:39.335 --> 18:41.187
I know we're at work, but
can you put your dad hat

18:41.188 --> 18:42.838
back on long enough to
give me advice about Tina?

18:44.574 --> 18:46.558
Find me on your break.

18:48.171 --> 18:49.912
This is what happens when I'm away?

18:49.913 --> 18:52.765
Yes. I guess you should just
quit now and come back home.

18:52.766 --> 18:54.717
You going back to school
was a big mistake.

18:54.718 --> 18:57.912
No, my big mistake was giving
you too much responsibility!

18:57.913 --> 18:59.412
Maybe I should put Emery in charge.

18:59.413 --> 19:01.307
- He can't handle it!
- I can't handle it.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.342
Hey, w-why not me?

19:05.222 --> 19:06.862
It wasn't too much for me.

19:06.863 --> 19:08.664
I let Grandma have the party on purpose.

19:08.665 --> 19:09.898
What?!

19:09.899 --> 19:12.334
What is going on with you?
Why would you do that?

19:12.335 --> 19:13.244
Because!

19:13.245 --> 19:15.838
You were obsessed with
school, not to mention Burt.

19:15.839 --> 19:17.689
- Who's Burt?
- Not now!

19:17.691 --> 19:19.458
A hot wrestler.

19:20.628 --> 19:23.212
I thought I could handle
you going back to school,

19:23.213 --> 19:25.164
but I'm afraid I'm losing you.

19:26.070 --> 19:29.518
Evan, you're not losing me.

19:29.519 --> 19:31.641
I know this is a big adjustment.

19:31.642 --> 19:33.489
You know, when you first started school,

19:33.490 --> 19:35.224
I was scared of losing you, too.

19:35.225 --> 19:37.076
- Really?
- Yes.

19:37.077 --> 19:38.695
And it was hard.

19:38.696 --> 19:41.063
But then I saw how great
school was for you.

19:41.064 --> 19:42.197
You were so happy.

19:42.198 --> 19:43.832
The classroom was my playground.

19:43.833 --> 19:46.169
You came home every day with
something new to tell me,

19:46.170 --> 19:48.837
and I need to make sure
I can do the same.

19:48.838 --> 19:52.474
So Vice Mommy Reports are back on.

19:52.475 --> 19:53.475
No exceptions.

19:53.476 --> 19:54.309
Deal?

19:55.069 --> 19:56.044
Deal.

19:56.045 --> 19:57.980
You hear that, you two?

19:57.981 --> 19:59.364
Clean up this mess.

19:59.366 --> 20:00.986
_

20:00.988 --> 20:02.518
You wanted this party so badly.

20:02.519 --> 20:05.788
I'll clean whatever. I'm just
happy not to be in charge.

20:05.789 --> 20:07.095
You'll be happy to know

20:07.096 --> 20:09.191
that I helped Eddie avoid
a packing disaster.

20:09.192 --> 20:11.281
He had all these cans in his suitcase.

20:11.282 --> 20:12.828
I threw them all in the recycling

20:12.829 --> 20:14.963
so he knew he had to pack for real.

20:14.964 --> 20:17.125
- I've taught you well.
- Mm.

20:19.966 --> 20:22.817
Tina, I'll cut right to
it. I'm shipping out.

20:22.819 --> 20:24.152
Okay...?

20:24.153 --> 20:25.761
I know we've been figuring
out our relationship,

20:25.762 --> 20:28.557
but I'm here to tell you,
I'm a one-woman man...

20:28.558 --> 20:29.808
And that woman is you.

20:30.589 --> 20:33.028
I'm not gonna force your hand,
but I want you to know,

20:33.029 --> 20:34.629
while I'm away, I'll be thinking of you.

20:34.630 --> 20:37.833
And when I return, I want to
take you out on a romantic date.

20:37.834 --> 20:39.911
I'm thinking... hot wings?

20:40.457 --> 20:41.578
What do you say?

20:43.000 --> 20:49.074
