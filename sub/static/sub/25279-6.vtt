WEBVTT

00:07.924 --> 00:09.634
[Colt] Is she in there?

00:09.718 --> 00:10.760
[Chuck] No.

00:13.471 --> 00:15.015
Abby!

00:15.098 --> 00:16.641
Abby!

00:18.101 --> 00:19.644
Abby!

00:23.189 --> 00:25.191
[theme song playing]

01:25.919 --> 01:28.254
There's still no word on Colt and Abby.

01:28.963 --> 01:33.593
I know the firefighters are overwhelmed,
but why can't the police go look for them?

01:33.676 --> 01:34.969
Last week, the sheriff's daughter

01:35.053 --> 01:38.848
locked herself in Marie Callender's
bathroom with a cheesecake.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.600
And they sent in a SWAT team.

01:41.893 --> 01:43.853
I know they'd need a SWAT team

01:43.937 --> 01:46.773
to get one of their key lime pies
out of my hands.

01:49.275 --> 01:52.070
Now, y'all don't worry. They'll find 'em.

01:52.153 --> 01:53.947
Oh, thank you, Dale.

01:55.156 --> 01:59.369
Well, I got to go check on a rabbit
with smoke inhalation.

02:00.328 --> 02:02.705
You ever seen a bunny cough?

02:03.498 --> 02:06.584
The only thing cuter is a possum sneezing.
[chuckles]

02:11.506 --> 02:13.174
Can I give you a hand with that?

02:15.635 --> 02:16.886
Maggie?

02:16.970 --> 02:18.388
I got it.

02:19.639 --> 02:20.640
Look...

02:21.141 --> 02:23.268
I'm sorry for getting upset earlier.

02:24.769 --> 02:27.438
I'm worried about Colt and Abby.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.357
I don't know what's going on
out at the ranch,

02:29.440 --> 02:31.860
and I'm surrounded by fucking people.

02:33.361 --> 02:38.158
I don't understand why prisoners get upset
at the idea of solitary confinement.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.870
You know, my son is missing, too.

02:42.453 --> 02:45.498
Look around you.
Everyone's having a shitty day.

02:45.582 --> 02:48.710
But you know what?
You're the only one being an asshole.

02:51.462 --> 02:53.965
Gene Stockwell
watched his truck burn down,

02:54.048 --> 02:56.217
and he's over there making sangria.

02:57.719 --> 02:58.928
You're right.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.682
-I shouldn't have done it, but--
-Stop.

03:02.765 --> 03:05.184
I don't wanna hear excuses.
I don't wanna hear why.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.604
It's just the same thing
over and over, Beau.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.608
You only care about yourself
and your precious ranch.

03:11.691 --> 03:15.111
If somebody tries to help you,
you just lash out and hurt them.

03:15.194 --> 03:17.363
So, I've had enough. I'm done.

03:17.447 --> 03:18.323
Maggie--

03:18.406 --> 03:21.409
You know, the reason
you're so afraid of this fire

03:21.492 --> 03:25.580
is because if the ranch burns...
you really will have nothing.

03:31.377 --> 03:34.714
[engine sputtering]

03:34.797 --> 03:35.924
Fuck!

03:36.007 --> 03:37.175
What the hell, Colt?

03:37.258 --> 03:39.719
I felt the engine lugging
on the way up here.

03:39.802 --> 03:41.596
Probably ash in the air-box.

03:44.015 --> 03:46.768
Well, hurry up. We gotta find Abby.

03:46.851 --> 03:50.146
We ain't that far from the house.
She probably just walked from here.

03:50.230 --> 03:54.651
Oh. Well, you get the truck running,
and I'll start walking.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.987
Oh, hey, cut through the woods.
It's faster.

03:58.071 --> 04:01.908
It leads right to Abby's bedroom...
window, I think.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.915
-Was that Ab?
-I don't know. Abby!

04:09.874 --> 04:12.961
That had to be her.
Who else would be out here right now?

04:13.044 --> 04:14.587
Is that thing fixed yet?

04:18.633 --> 04:19.842
-Colt! Dad!
-Holy shit.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.511
-Thank God you're safe.
-Oh, my God.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.137
Where the hell were you?

04:23.221 --> 04:25.431
When my truck broke down,
I walked to the house.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.517
By the time I got there,
you and Mom were gone.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.519
I'm just so happy you're safe.

04:29.602 --> 04:31.312
You're about to be happier.

04:32.522 --> 04:33.356
Hi!

04:33.439 --> 04:35.024
-[Colt] Are you kidding me?
-[Abby] I know.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.359
[Chuck] What the hell?

04:36.442 --> 04:39.904
Whoa! Come on.
They've still got that new puppy smell.

04:40.488 --> 04:43.408
Hold on. How did you get an ATV
and a basket of puppies?

04:43.491 --> 04:44.659
When I was stuck at the house,

04:44.742 --> 04:46.869
I remembered the Hendersons
had an ATV in their garage,

04:46.953 --> 04:48.788
so I smashed the window and stole it.

04:49.747 --> 04:52.041
Good call.
There's no rules in the apocalypse.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.460
Hold up. Finish the story in the truck.

04:54.544 --> 04:55.878
-We gotta get out of here.
-[Colt] Yeah, yeah.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.964
We'll take the puppies and leave the ATV.

04:58.047 --> 04:59.299
Fuck the Hendersons.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.470
-'Sup, Beer Pong?
-I have good news.

05:04.554 --> 05:05.680
Well, finally.

05:06.264 --> 05:08.558
They got the fires contained
up in Montrose,

05:08.641 --> 05:10.476
so they're sending resources here.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.646
So, hopefully, they can look
for Colt and Abby in a few hours.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.398
A few hours?

05:15.481 --> 05:16.649
That's your good news?

05:16.733 --> 05:19.110
Thanks for getting our hopes up, dipshit.

05:19.610 --> 05:22.697
You know what? I'm done waiting.
I'm gonna go look for 'em.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.574
Rooster, don't be stupid.
It's too dangerous.

05:24.657 --> 05:27.493
Yeah, and Chuck and Colt
are already out looking for Abby.

05:27.577 --> 05:28.661
If you go look for them,

05:28.745 --> 05:30.413
we'll have to send
someone to look for you.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.915
And pretty soon,
it's like watching a horror film

05:32.999 --> 05:36.252
where you're yelling, "Stop going
in the fucking basement already."

05:37.170 --> 05:38.379
I'm going.

05:38.463 --> 05:39.547
Rooster, stop.

05:40.214 --> 05:41.799
-What's going on?
-I'm gonna look for Colt.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.926
-Give me the keys to the pickup.
-Don't you dare.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.721
-I'll go with you.
-Let's go.

05:48.264 --> 05:49.974
Billy, shoot them both in the leg.

05:50.975 --> 05:52.643
-I thought you were done with me.
-[Maggie] Right.

05:52.727 --> 05:56.272
Billy, shoot Rooster in the leg.
Shoot him wherever the hell you want.

05:58.691 --> 06:00.735
Oh, my God. Abby.

06:00.818 --> 06:03.279
-Where were you? What happened?
-[Rooster] Jesus, man.

06:03.362 --> 06:04.197
You scared the shit out of us.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.199
-I am so mad at you.
-We were gonna look for you.

06:06.282 --> 06:07.116
What happened?

06:07.200 --> 06:08.534
All right, all right.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.286
I'll set the scene.

06:10.369 --> 06:12.580
So me and Chuck's driving
through the woods, right?

06:12.663 --> 06:14.165
Like, just two brave heroes.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.250
A couple times, he's like,
"We gotta turn around."

06:16.334 --> 06:17.710
I'm like, "No."

06:17.794 --> 06:19.378
And he's like, "Cool."

06:19.462 --> 06:22.882
So we keep truckin', and there's
fire everywhere and flashing lights.

06:22.965 --> 06:24.967
The only thing missing
was Carrie Underwood singing about

06:25.051 --> 06:26.636
everybody ought to get ready
for a Sunday night.

06:27.804 --> 06:30.681
Colt, nobody cares, okay?
'Cause I rescued puppies.

06:31.182 --> 06:32.100
Hi!

06:32.183 --> 06:33.893
Oh, sweetie.

06:33.976 --> 06:34.894
You know what?

06:35.978 --> 06:37.105
We gotta name these guys.

06:37.688 --> 06:39.398
Florida, Georgia, Line.

06:40.566 --> 06:41.984
We should get you settled.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.653
-You must be tired.
-Yeah.

06:43.736 --> 06:46.197
Yeah, you look terrible.

06:46.280 --> 06:47.824
Thanks, Mom.

06:51.202 --> 06:52.203
Colt.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.957
You're probably pissed I went out there...

06:56.040 --> 06:57.500
[stammers]

07:03.172 --> 07:04.257
Thanks, Dad.

07:16.060 --> 07:16.894
[sniffs]

07:29.323 --> 07:30.366
Hey, Rooster.

07:30.867 --> 07:31.826
Hey.

07:34.412 --> 07:35.580
Oh. Shit.

07:36.664 --> 07:37.623
We doin' this?

07:38.916 --> 07:39.917
Ew.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.919
Not if this fire spread across
the whole world

07:42.003 --> 07:43.963
and killed everyone except us.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.674
Okay. When that happens, we'll see.

07:47.258 --> 07:51.471
[scoffs] Look, so... I saw you met Nick.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.307
I did, yeah.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.267
Let me ask you a question.

07:56.851 --> 07:58.644
-Who's better looking?
-Nick.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.146
Take your time.

08:01.105 --> 08:01.939
Nick.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.900
Okay, think about it and get back to me.

08:04.484 --> 08:08.237
[scoffs] God, I can't believe
my mom's dating him again.

08:09.030 --> 08:12.366
He always comes around with flowers,
making promises,

08:12.450 --> 08:16.204
and it always ends with him drunk,
cheating on her, stealing her stuff.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.039
I mean, how many times does a guy

08:18.122 --> 08:20.374
have to buy back his own car
from a police auction?

08:21.751 --> 08:23.669
I like buying cars from police auctions.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.588
It's like <i>Storage Wars.</i>

08:25.671 --> 08:27.173
You never know what's in the trunk.

08:28.591 --> 08:33.095
Look, as hard as this is to believe,
I was happier when she was with you.

08:33.679 --> 08:37.642
[clicks tongue] Well, you know.
They got history together.

08:37.725 --> 08:39.727
I mean, he is Darlene's dad.

08:39.810 --> 08:41.062
Allegedly.

08:42.813 --> 08:46.359
I don't know what your relationship
with my mom is anymore, and don't tell me.

08:46.442 --> 08:48.194
We're still fucking.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.363
God. Okay.

08:50.446 --> 08:53.449
Let me get to the point
before you tell me anything else.

08:54.825 --> 08:56.118
You think you can talk to her for me?

08:58.329 --> 09:01.415
Honestly, Heather,
you know, your mom's a big girl.

09:01.999 --> 09:03.042
It's not really my business.

09:03.709 --> 09:06.212
I'm just saying
I think she might listen to you.

09:06.796 --> 09:09.590
If she listened to me,
I'd be in the janitor's closet right now.

09:10.466 --> 09:12.009
You know... fuckin'.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.099
Oh.

09:18.766 --> 09:22.770
Remember when we'd sneak out of geometry
and make out here in the hallway?

09:22.853 --> 09:23.854
Wait...

09:23.938 --> 09:25.147
I never took geometry.

09:25.898 --> 09:28.276
-Hey, look at your championship trophy.
-No.

09:28.359 --> 09:30.069
No, you ain't gonna distract me...

09:30.695 --> 09:32.154
Look at how shiny it is.

09:33.614 --> 09:37.493
Baby Bennett,
your dad was an awesome quarterback.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.287
And in his football pants,

09:39.370 --> 09:41.664
his butt looked
like the cutest little blue peach.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.541
What are you talkin' 'bout? It still does.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.919
-A few extra squats wouldn't kill you.
-Hey!

09:47.003 --> 09:49.297
It's called sympathy weight.
That's a real thing.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.381
[chuckles]

09:51.799 --> 09:53.301
-Look at that picture...
-Hmm.

09:53.384 --> 09:54.844
...when we won state.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.222
The star quarterback
and the head cheerleader.

09:58.306 --> 10:00.182
Back then, your mom was a smoke show.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.934
-Yeah, she still is. [kisses]
-[chuckles]

10:02.560 --> 10:04.812
-I'd hit it right now.
-[chuckles]

10:07.023 --> 10:08.816
I can't believe
they're tearing this place down.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.612
-Hmm
-A lot of memories on that field.

10:13.946 --> 10:17.074
Throwing five touchdowns.
Breaking all the school passing records.

10:17.158 --> 10:17.992
[chuckles]

10:18.075 --> 10:20.119
Won the Colorado State Player of the Year.

10:20.202 --> 10:21.454
Our first kiss.

10:21.537 --> 10:22.747
Yeah, I ain't done.

10:23.539 --> 10:25.291
Getting carried off the field on the--

10:25.374 --> 10:27.627
-[chuckles]
-[chuckles] Get out...

10:28.794 --> 10:30.379
Our first kiss.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.758
You tasted like Skoal and Gatorade.

10:33.841 --> 10:36.344
-[chuckles] You mean like America?
-[chuckles]

10:38.554 --> 10:40.306
Gosh. I don't know.

10:40.389 --> 10:45.394
Between losing this place
and maybe our homes,

10:45.478 --> 10:47.271
all we'll have left is memories.

10:47.355 --> 10:50.066
It's like Garrison is slowly being erased.

10:51.192 --> 10:54.779
Yup. But as long as we got each other,
we'll make new memories, right?

10:55.529 --> 10:56.489
Yeah.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.414
[both groan]

11:08.084 --> 11:09.251
[Abby clicks tongue]

11:09.919 --> 11:12.088
Last night, I was so scared.

11:12.171 --> 11:15.132
I mean, I thought...
I thought I was never gonna see you again.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.052
[both sighs]

11:18.135 --> 11:19.804
I kept thinking
about all the little things

11:19.887 --> 11:22.139
we worry about and fight about.

11:22.223 --> 11:26.310
I mean, so what if you watched
the finale of <i>Riverdale </i>without me?

11:26.811 --> 11:29.313
-That does not make you a little bitch.
-[chuckles]

11:30.231 --> 11:32.233
So what if you finished my hair gel?

11:32.316 --> 11:34.693
Or you said you'd replace it
and you still haven't?

11:34.777 --> 11:37.029
-I replaced it.
-Yeah, with store brand.

11:38.739 --> 11:39.740
But, hey.

11:40.658 --> 11:41.492
[chuckles]

11:42.368 --> 11:44.703
And all our stupid fights
about the wedding.

11:46.330 --> 11:49.375
So what if I look like a double-wide
in my wedding dress?

11:50.918 --> 11:53.712
Okay, when I pause, that's when you say,
"You look so beautiful."

11:53.796 --> 11:56.882
I'm sorry. I caught a reflection
of myself in the trophy case.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.592
[both chuckle]

11:59.510 --> 12:02.930
I was just worried
about the stupidest stuff.

12:03.013 --> 12:04.014
Yeah.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.724
What people thought about me.

12:06.308 --> 12:08.060
That I couldn't drink at the wedding.

12:08.144 --> 12:10.312
How I was gonna look in the pictures.

12:12.314 --> 12:15.609
I lost sight of the most important part
of our wedding...

12:16.569 --> 12:17.486
us.

12:22.324 --> 12:23.826
Do you know what sucks?

12:25.870 --> 12:27.246
We're supposed to be married right now.

12:27.329 --> 12:31.250
[sighs] I know.
I know. I wish we were.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.171
You think it's ever gonna happen?

12:35.254 --> 12:36.630
Come on. Of course it is.

12:37.923 --> 12:41.802
I don't know. I think the universe
is just conspiring against us.

12:41.886 --> 12:44.054
No. You've said stuff like that before.

12:45.681 --> 12:47.349
Things are awesome.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.060
We're together. We're in love.

12:51.395 --> 12:53.814
-There's a baby on the way.
-[chuckles]

12:53.898 --> 12:56.775
Somehow, as I get older,
my hair keeps getting thicker.

12:56.859 --> 13:01.113
-Yeah, thanks to my store brand.
-[chuckles]

13:03.991 --> 13:06.994
I mean, if we were meant to be,
would it really be this hard?

13:07.077 --> 13:09.121
We were about to get married
at the courthouse,

13:09.205 --> 13:11.290
-and there was a fucking wildfire, Colt.
-[grunts]

13:11.373 --> 13:12.750
A wildfire!

13:12.833 --> 13:15.336
You know what?
I don't care how hard it is.

13:16.962 --> 13:23.802
There is nothing in this whole wide world
that will ever stop me from loving you.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.601
Soon as this is over, we'll go
to the courthouse and get married.

13:30.684 --> 13:33.062
Yeah, that's if the courthouse
isn't burnt down.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.606
Come on. The courthouse is gonna be there.

13:35.689 --> 13:37.274
We're getting married.

13:37.775 --> 13:38.609
Are we?

13:39.693 --> 13:40.861
I promise.

13:47.785 --> 13:50.579
If the courthouse burns down,

13:50.663 --> 13:52.748
does that mean
all the criminal records disappear?

13:52.831 --> 13:53.666
[laughs]

13:53.749 --> 13:56.585
Should we be burning down
the courthouse right now?

13:56.669 --> 13:57.878
Probably. [chuckles]

14:02.591 --> 14:05.094
Hey, Rooster, what's going on?

14:05.177 --> 14:07.930
I don't know. Just had a dip. [groans]

14:08.013 --> 14:09.223
Ate some lunch.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.810
-Sold some kids some fake weed.
-[Mary laughs]

14:12.893 --> 14:14.853
Man, it's like I'm
really back in high school.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.272
[laughs]

14:17.731 --> 14:20.442
So, where's that dude, Nick?

14:20.526 --> 14:22.403
He went to check out the weight room.

14:22.486 --> 14:25.197
He's used to working out
between 1:00 and 1:30.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.159
So, what's up with that guy?

14:29.910 --> 14:30.786
What do you mean?

14:31.912 --> 14:35.082
Well, you know how when we
used to watch <i>The Bachelorette, </i>

14:35.165 --> 14:38.836
we'd go nuts every time that Ashley
would give that tool Josh K a rose?

14:40.004 --> 14:44.216
Well, Nick kind of seems like Josh K,
you know?

14:44.300 --> 14:47.344
Except, like, not even a party planner.

14:47.928 --> 14:51.223
No, I... I told you, he's changed.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.559
We've been back together
for almost five months.

14:53.642 --> 14:57.479
Not once has he said,
"Oh, quick, there's a cop. Swallow this."

14:59.857 --> 15:03.903
Sometimes people pretend to be things
they're not to get a girl, you know?

15:03.986 --> 15:07.448
Like, I joined a cult once
for two weeks for this blonde.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.868
Then I found out all the girls
are married to the leader.

15:11.952 --> 15:13.787
Then I spent two weeks
trying to form a cult.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.748
[laughs]

15:16.874 --> 15:20.002
Just sayin', you know,
I feel like you could do better.

15:21.003 --> 15:23.714
Now I see. And better is you.

15:24.298 --> 15:26.342
-Your words.
-[chuckles]

15:27.176 --> 15:29.887
I'm just looking out for you.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.348
Oh, yeah.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.892
Yeah, if I had to describe you
in two words,

15:34.975 --> 15:37.394
I would definitely say "good Samaritan."

15:38.395 --> 15:40.898
I mean, I'd say, "redneck Wolverine."

15:40.981 --> 15:44.360
But, you know, it's not about me.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.948
I just don't know
that Nick's a good guy, and I...

15:49.531 --> 15:50.991
I think you deserve to be treated right.

15:52.076 --> 15:53.619
I can take care of myself.

15:54.495 --> 15:55.329
Are you sure?

15:56.413 --> 15:57.915
Yeah, I'm sure.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.418
All right.

16:01.502 --> 16:04.463
Well, don't bring him
by the Wendy's drive-through.

16:04.546 --> 16:05.923
That's our spot.

16:08.050 --> 16:10.052
-See ya.
-All right.

16:12.262 --> 16:15.349
Wait. I got a crazy idea.
I need your help with something.

16:16.266 --> 16:18.686
-Ski mask or no ski mask?
-No ski mask.

16:19.269 --> 16:20.688
Bummer. All right, I'm in.

16:25.442 --> 16:29.905
Okay, if you're gonna blindfold me,
you've gotta call out the stairs.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.658
Well, I caught you. The second time.
[chuckles]

16:32.741 --> 16:33.784
What is goin' on?

16:33.867 --> 16:36.704
You made me get dressed up,
put a blindfold on me.

16:36.787 --> 16:39.581
If I take this thing off
and we are at Medieval Times again,

16:39.665 --> 16:41.166
I am going to be pissed.

16:41.250 --> 16:44.044
-Don't worry, my lady.
-Oh, no.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.088
-All right.
-[sighs]

16:46.171 --> 16:50.509
Tonight, I'm gonna prove to you
that the universe is on our side.

16:50.592 --> 16:51.427
[chuckles]

16:56.807 --> 16:58.642
[Abby stammers and chuckles]

17:02.062 --> 17:03.689
What...

17:03.772 --> 17:05.774
Wait, what is going on? [chuckles]

17:07.359 --> 17:08.360
We're getting married.

17:10.571 --> 17:11.530
What?

17:13.490 --> 17:17.870
I don't wanna live another day in my life
without you being my wife.

17:20.497 --> 17:23.042
I love you, Abby.

17:24.501 --> 17:27.379
I know sometimes it seems
this whole world's up against us.

17:27.463 --> 17:28.756
[chuckles]

17:28.839 --> 17:32.384
But as long as we're together,
we'll make it through anything.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.013
We're a team.

17:36.513 --> 17:39.892
And our team is greater
than some of the parts.

17:39.975 --> 17:42.186
What? "Some of the parts"?

17:42.269 --> 17:43.187
Yeah.

17:43.270 --> 17:44.104
It's a phrase.

17:45.105 --> 17:45.939
The point is...

17:48.358 --> 17:51.528
the only thing that's stopping us
from getting married right now

17:51.612 --> 17:52.946
is you saying no.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.241
You know what I say?

17:57.034 --> 18:00.370
Tonight, the universe is not against us.

18:00.454 --> 18:02.539
Tonight, the universe is our bitch!

18:02.623 --> 18:04.083
-We're getting married?
-[laughs] Yeah!

18:04.166 --> 18:05.626
-We're getting married!
-Fuck yeah!

18:05.709 --> 18:06.794
Oh, good.

18:06.877 --> 18:10.214
A little hint of what
our grandkid's first word will be.

18:10.297 --> 18:11.715
[chuckles] You guys were in on this, too?

18:11.799 --> 18:14.134
Well, it's not what we planned,

18:14.218 --> 18:18.097
but we did want some place outdoors
where we could seat a lot of people.

18:19.640 --> 18:24.812
Sweetheart, I've dreamed about this moment
since the day you were born.

18:25.521 --> 18:30.901
And I'm so proud to see you and Colt start
the next great chapter of your lives.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.029
I love you so much,

18:34.113 --> 18:35.405
and I'm...

18:35.489 --> 18:37.866
What the fuck is Maggie doing up there?

18:39.368 --> 18:43.455
Uh, Father McGinty is
on his annual mission in Nevada.

18:44.039 --> 18:45.165
He gives one sermon

18:45.249 --> 18:48.252
and spends the rest of the week
playing pai gow.

18:48.752 --> 18:49.920
But don't worry.

18:50.003 --> 18:55.676
My mom got ordained online
so she could marry her two male friends.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.971
We should give her number to Uncle Gary.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.974
Okay, well, I better get up there, so...

19:02.057 --> 19:04.935
Mrs. Phillips, would you care for a ride?

19:05.018 --> 19:09.398
-Oh, I didn't realize it was a muscle car.
-[chuckles]

19:09.481 --> 19:10.482
[chuckles]

19:11.525 --> 19:14.570
[exhales] My baby girl.

19:15.070 --> 19:16.113
You look so beautiful.

19:16.196 --> 19:19.741
Thank you, Dad. You look very handsome.

19:20.534 --> 19:23.287
And your mom didn't want me
to save this tie from the fire.

19:23.370 --> 19:24.204
Oh.

19:25.622 --> 19:28.667
Seeing your child look this happy...

19:29.668 --> 19:32.129
There's no greater feeling in the world.

19:33.213 --> 19:34.715
I love you, toots.

19:35.591 --> 19:36.800
I love you.

19:38.218 --> 19:39.344
Shall we?

19:40.929 --> 19:44.391
-You know, it's not too late to run.
-[laughs]

19:44.474 --> 19:49.021
[wedding march playing]

20:08.123 --> 20:10.459
Well, welcome, everyone.

20:10.542 --> 20:14.087
Thanks for joining us
on this football field, where...

20:14.171 --> 20:16.548
The home of so many great triumphs.

20:17.507 --> 20:21.678
None as good as the one
we're celebrating tonight, though.

20:21.762 --> 20:24.890
Except maybe the '98 championship.

20:24.973 --> 20:26.558
MVP in the house!

20:26.642 --> 20:28.393
[men cheering]

20:29.394 --> 20:32.564
Colt, you have the world's biggest heart.

20:34.107 --> 20:37.152
And so I'm thrilled you've found
someone to give it to.

20:38.237 --> 20:41.156
Abby, I've always thought of you
as a daughter.

20:41.240 --> 20:46.203
So I'm not just marrying Colt to Abby.
I'm marrying my son to my daughter.

20:46.286 --> 20:47.496
-Mom.
-Oh, that's bad.

20:47.579 --> 20:49.122
I'm... That's...

20:49.206 --> 20:52.709
Uh, but before the ceremony,
Rooster wants to say something, right?

20:52.793 --> 20:54.962
Mind if I say a few words first?

20:55.045 --> 20:58.840
Well, I'd be surprised if you said
more than a few, but go ahead.

20:59.549 --> 21:03.887
First of all, thanks to anyone
for helping to make this thing happen.

21:04.471 --> 21:06.723
And a special thanks
to all the firefighters

21:06.807 --> 21:09.017
who are risking it all for the rest of us.

21:11.478 --> 21:16.191
I said this to my wife
on the day I proposed.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.320
"I love you so very much.

21:22.406 --> 21:27.828
I don't even mind that life
made me wait so long to find you.

21:29.871 --> 21:33.000
The waiting only made
the finding sweeter."

21:34.418 --> 21:37.671
That was one of the great poets
of our time...

21:37.754 --> 21:39.381
Ronald Reagan.

21:40.382 --> 21:43.135
-Beau's one true love.
-[chuckles]

21:44.386 --> 21:47.097
That woman right there
is the best friend you'll ever have.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.350
Make sure she always knows

21:50.434 --> 21:54.271
how grateful you are
to have her in your life.

21:57.441 --> 22:00.193
Well, Abby...

22:00.277 --> 22:05.157
I've seen Colt without you
and I've seen Colt with you.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.616
And it ain't even close.

22:07.576 --> 22:10.120
And if my baby brother is about to make

22:10.203 --> 22:12.706
the biggest mistake
a man can make in life,

22:13.415 --> 22:14.249
I'm glad it's with you.

22:15.834 --> 22:18.462
Now I'm gonna read from the holy book...

22:18.545 --> 22:20.964
of Sam Hunt. [clears throat]

22:22.382 --> 22:26.219
"Got hips like honey,
so thick and so sweet.

22:27.554 --> 22:29.890
It ain't no curves like hers

22:30.474 --> 22:32.225
on them downtown streets."

22:32.934 --> 22:37.522
All right, all right, okay.
Now we'll let the bride and groom speak.

22:38.106 --> 22:38.940
Abby?

22:40.567 --> 22:45.739
Wow. Okay. Where do I start? [sighs]

22:47.574 --> 22:48.575
Colt...

22:50.327 --> 22:53.747
[sighs] with you,
nothing ever goes as planned...

22:53.830 --> 22:55.707
[both laugh]

22:56.458 --> 23:00.170
as evidence to the fact
that I'm standing here pregnant,

23:00.253 --> 23:02.756
getting married on a football field.

23:02.839 --> 23:03.757
Mustangs!

23:03.840 --> 23:05.092
[guests clamoring]

23:05.175 --> 23:07.344
-Damn straight.
-[indistinct chatter]

23:08.845 --> 23:10.889
I can't believe how lucky...

23:12.390 --> 23:14.559
I was to be able to grow up with you.

23:17.062 --> 23:17.938
[sniffles]

23:19.523 --> 23:22.859
And how lucky I am
to get to grow old with you.

23:24.319 --> 23:26.988
And no matter what life throws at us...

23:28.573 --> 23:30.867
[sighs] we're gonna get
through it together...

23:33.370 --> 23:35.413
'cause we're a team, Bennett.

23:36.665 --> 23:38.416
And we're better than...

23:38.500 --> 23:40.377
[chuckles] some of the parts.

23:41.378 --> 23:42.337
That's true.

23:44.297 --> 23:46.049
I love you.

23:49.302 --> 23:52.055
[chuckles] I should have gone first. Uh...

23:53.807 --> 23:55.767
Since the moment I met you,

23:58.353 --> 23:59.187
I knew...

24:00.689 --> 24:01.731
someday...

24:03.525 --> 24:04.526
you'd be my wife.

24:06.194 --> 24:08.738
And even when we weren't together...

24:10.657 --> 24:15.954
I spent every day trying to find a way
to get back home to you.

24:20.417 --> 24:21.585
I love you.

24:22.544 --> 24:23.795
[mouths] I love you.

24:25.463 --> 24:29.092
And I think everyone here would agree
that you make me a better person.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.887
-Oh, way better.
-Kind of an asshole.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.930
[chuckling] All right. Okay.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.144
You're not just my better half.

24:41.730 --> 24:44.399
You're the better 75% to my...

24:45.859 --> 24:46.860
the rest of it.

24:46.943 --> 24:48.153
[laughs]

24:52.157 --> 24:53.450
I love you, Abby.

24:53.533 --> 24:55.076
[softly] I love you.

24:55.911 --> 24:57.746
All right. Colt Bennett,

24:58.705 --> 25:02.375
do you take Abby Phillips to be your wife?

25:03.376 --> 25:04.836
I sure do.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.463
And, Abby Phillips,

25:06.963 --> 25:09.257
do you take Colt Bennett
to be your husband?

25:09.341 --> 25:11.051
I sure do.

25:11.676 --> 25:14.429
-[both chuckle]
-Got it.

25:14.512 --> 25:17.182
Well, what are you waiting for?
Kiss already.

25:17.265 --> 25:19.351
[cheering]

25:21.895 --> 25:23.980
Still taste like Skoal and Gatorade.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.899
-'Cause it's country strong.
-[laughs]

25:25.982 --> 25:29.736
By the power vested in me
by the e-church of the US Virgin Islands,

25:29.819 --> 25:32.155
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

25:32.989 --> 25:35.075
[cheering]

25:46.002 --> 25:47.379
[gun firing]

25:47.462 --> 25:49.381
[cheering]

25:49.464 --> 25:52.300
Dude, I told you.
Stop firing your gun in the air.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.469
Dude, I keep telling you.
It's not my gun.

25:55.136 --> 25:56.054
Damn it!

25:58.223 --> 26:00.767
-[chuckles] Oh, yeah. Hi.
-Hey, guys.

26:00.850 --> 26:02.102
Thanks for being here.

26:02.185 --> 26:05.188
I mean, your other option
was dying in a fire, so...

26:05.272 --> 26:07.774
-[both chuckle]
-No, it was fun.

26:07.857 --> 26:10.902
We played a drinking game.
We drank every time you teared up.

26:10.986 --> 26:13.530
Yeah, I'm kind of surprised
we're still standing.

26:13.613 --> 26:15.991
I mean, who cries during the kiss?

26:16.074 --> 26:17.742
Later, we're doing
a version of the bouquet toss

26:17.826 --> 26:20.870
where whoever catches it
doesn't have to date Rooster.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.665
Where were you last year?

26:23.748 --> 26:25.333
[all laugh]

26:25.417 --> 26:26.835
-Congratulations.
-[Abby] Thank you.

26:26.918 --> 26:27.961
[Colt] Thanks for coming.

26:28.044 --> 26:30.797
You said you had a shit-ton of music.
Where's the rest of it?

26:30.880 --> 26:35.385
Just put on "Dale's Club Jams Volume Six."

26:35.468 --> 26:36.970
You'll thank me later.

26:42.642 --> 26:43.643
Hey, man.

26:43.727 --> 26:44.894
Hey. 'Sup, dude?

26:45.520 --> 26:48.315
-That was a nice wedding.
-Yeah, it was pretty good.

26:48.898 --> 26:53.445
Although, you know, no bachelor party,
no drunken bridesmaids to hit on.

26:53.528 --> 26:56.239
Whatever. I'll hit on whatever chick
catches the bouquet later.

26:58.116 --> 26:59.075
So, listen.

26:59.159 --> 27:02.704
-I know you and Mary had a thing.
-[chuckles] So what happened?

27:02.787 --> 27:05.665
She yell out "Oh, Rooster!" by accident?

27:06.249 --> 27:07.459
Good one.

27:07.542 --> 27:09.711
It's cool you guys
still have a good relationship,

27:09.794 --> 27:11.004
but just a heads-up,

27:11.087 --> 27:13.965
you ever go near her again
and I'll fucking kill you.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.888
[chuckles] But, hey. Congrats again, man.

27:24.142 --> 27:25.727
Yeah, that's right. Walk away.

27:26.811 --> 27:29.647
-Thank you. Thanks.
-[both laughing]

27:30.690 --> 27:32.859
Mom, where did you get the bottle of wine?

27:32.942 --> 27:35.820
It turns out I told your mom
to pack up all her valuables.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.530
She packed a box full of wine.

27:38.323 --> 27:42.077
I only saved the things
I have an emotional connection with.

27:42.577 --> 27:46.456
[chuckles] Thank you guys
so much for all your help.

27:49.334 --> 27:50.627
Watching you...

27:51.544 --> 27:54.881
-walk your daughter down the aisle was...
-[chuckles]

27:54.964 --> 27:57.133
Where's Mary?
She's gonna be drinking again.

27:57.217 --> 27:58.218
[all laugh]

27:58.927 --> 28:01.888
Listen, Colt, when all of this is over,

28:01.971 --> 28:07.268
maybe it'd be a good time to revisit
the idea of me investing in your ranch.

28:09.896 --> 28:13.316
Oh, my God! That's so generous.
Thank you, Dad.

28:14.859 --> 28:17.779
Uh, yeah, well, I appreciate that, sir.

28:18.738 --> 28:22.659
Actually, it's a little too generous.
I think we're doing okay.

28:22.742 --> 28:25.954
Oh, come on. It's probably something
I should have done already.

28:26.037 --> 28:29.374
Oh, hey, Hank, now's a good time
for you to meet Abby's parents.

28:29.457 --> 28:30.875
Not now. I'm busy.

28:36.047 --> 28:38.091
That was pretty nice,
what you said at the wedding.

28:39.050 --> 28:43.138
I'm not sure one speech makes up
for 30 years of being an asshole.

28:44.139 --> 28:47.183
Beau, you're 72 years old.

28:47.267 --> 28:49.310
I'll give you the first two years.

28:54.733 --> 28:58.903
It was a messed-up road getting here,
but there it is,

28:58.987 --> 29:02.282
-next generation of Bennetts.
-Yep.

29:03.742 --> 29:08.371
I heard on the scanner, the helicopters
are making water drops out by the ranch.

29:08.955 --> 29:12.083
-Jesus. Do the boys know?
-No.

29:12.959 --> 29:14.878
And I don't want 'em to.

29:16.337 --> 29:18.548
Nothing we can do about it now.

29:18.631 --> 29:20.592
Why ruin this?

29:20.675 --> 29:23.553
Yeah, you're right. Give everyone tonight.

29:29.476 --> 29:31.686
Everything will be all right, Mags.

29:33.563 --> 29:36.065
-How do you know?
-I don't.

29:36.858 --> 29:40.153
But you know me.
I always look on the bright side.
