01:09.027 --> 01:10.571
[Shiro]
Coran...

01:10.654 --> 01:13.865
How soon will we get
to the Blade of Marmora's base?

01:13.949 --> 01:15.659
Based on the coordinates
that Ulaz gave us,

01:15.742 --> 01:17.995
we should be there
within a few <i>doboshes.</i>

01:18.078 --> 01:19.329
I can't wait to see it!

01:19.413 --> 01:23.917
I mean, they were able to fold space-time,
and that was just at an outpost!

01:24.001 --> 01:27.587
-Mm, the space taco. It left us too soon.
-[stomach grumbles]

01:27.671 --> 01:31.550
Well, sure, but my point is, imagine
how amazing their home base will be!

01:31.633 --> 01:33.635
Exactly. It could take on any shape.

01:33.719 --> 01:36.555
<i>Like a space jelly donut.</i>
<i>Or long, like a space Ã©clair.</i>

01:36.638 --> 01:38.890
<i>Or a space cheese blintz</i>
<i>with a cherry sauce on top.</i>

01:38.974 --> 01:41.643
<i>Maybe a little dusting of powdered sugar.</i>
<i>That's the stars.</i>

01:41.727 --> 01:44.104
Aw! Now, I'm hungry for breakfast.

01:44.187 --> 01:47.733
Guys, this is a serious mission.
We need to focus.

01:47.816 --> 01:50.235
[mockingly]
"We need to focus."

01:50.319 --> 01:53.905
-[Coran] The base is in range.
-Take us in slowly.

01:54.865 --> 01:57.618
[Coran] <i>That might prove</i>
<i>the tiniest bit of a challenge.</i>

02:01.371 --> 02:04.291
[Hunk] <i>Is that a black hole?</i>
[Coran] <i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

02:05.000 --> 02:09.045
<i>It's two black holes</i>
<i>and a giant blue star.</i>

02:09.128 --> 02:10.631
[Hunk]
<i>That's not better.</i>

02:10.714 --> 02:13.342
No kidding. Just inside a black hole,

02:13.425 --> 02:17.137
the temperature is one millionth
of a degree above absolute zero.

02:17.220 --> 02:20.599
But, just outside of that, it's hundreds
of millions of degrees Celsius.

02:22.059 --> 02:24.728
Okay, it's like when you try to nuke
a frozen burrito in the microwave,

02:24.811 --> 02:26.480
and it comes out
all scorching hot on the outside,

02:26.563 --> 02:28.231
but it's still frozen
in the middle, right?

02:28.315 --> 02:29.524
Now, I'm hungry for lunch!

02:29.608 --> 02:33.612
Guys, quiet!
Coran, where's the base located?

02:34.196 --> 02:37.532
In between those three
deadly celestial objects.

02:37.616 --> 02:41.286
-The perfect defensive position.
-Or the perfect trap.

02:41.370 --> 02:43.955
Yeah, I'm with Allura. Maybe
we shouldn't, like, go in there at all?

02:44.039 --> 02:46.625
What are you talking about?
We have to go in!

02:46.708 --> 02:50.754
This is the whole reason we came out here!
There is no other option!

02:50.837 --> 02:54.341
Okay. Jeez. Calm down.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.011
[electronic beeping]

02:58.095 --> 03:00.305
[female computer voice]
<i>Identify yourself.</i>

03:02.307 --> 03:04.768
Open a hailing frequency, Coran.

03:04.851 --> 03:09.147
We are the Paladins of Voltron,
sent here by Ulaz.

03:19.991 --> 03:22.953
<i>Two may enter. Come unarmed.</i>

03:23.995 --> 03:28.250
Why would they insist we come unarmed?
Shiro, this doesn't feel right.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.335
We've come too far to turn back now.

03:30.419 --> 03:33.547
They just sent us a route to the base,
but we'll have to move quickly.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.299
Because of the solar flares,
it's only open for another <i>varga.</i>

03:36.383 --> 03:38.385
Then, it will be closed for two <i>quintants.</i>

03:38.468 --> 03:42.431
-They're gonna close it for two years?
-Two days.

03:42.514 --> 03:43.348
Oh.

03:43.432 --> 03:46.393
So, any thoughts on who's gonna join you
on this little mission?

03:46.476 --> 03:48.103
I'm thinking things
might get a little hot,

03:48.186 --> 03:50.605
so you're gonna want someone
who can stay cool.

03:50.689 --> 03:52.858
You're right.
Keith, you're coming with me.

03:53.525 --> 03:57.237
Keith's a hothead! He's probably going
to shoot first and ask questions later!

03:57.320 --> 04:00.449
And they're not gonna be able to answer
his questions because they'll be dead!

04:02.784 --> 04:05.537
We haven't yet severed
Zarkon's link with the Black Lion,

04:05.620 --> 04:07.122
so it has to stay here.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.499
And the Red Lion can withstand
the heat from that sun.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.460
So, yes, it'll be Keith.

04:11.543 --> 04:14.838
[Coran] The course to the base will be
quite treacherous, to say the least.

04:14.921 --> 04:18.132
You're walking a razor's edge between
the gravitational pull of the black holes

04:18.216 --> 04:19.468
and the sun.

04:19.551 --> 04:24.097
One false move, and you'll either be
crushed into infinity or burnt to a crisp.

04:34.608 --> 04:38.445
-Keith, is everything okay?
-I'm fine.

04:38.528 --> 04:41.156
You kind of blew up
at everybody back there.

04:41.239 --> 04:44.201
You'll have to control your emotions if
you're going to lead this group someday.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.120
[chuckles]
Lead the group?

04:47.704 --> 04:51.208
When we were stranded, I told you,
if anything ever happens to me,

04:51.291 --> 04:52.709
I want you to lead Voltron.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.295
I thought you were just
delirious with pain.

04:55.378 --> 04:56.963
Why would you make me the leader?

04:57.047 --> 05:01.718
Because I know what you're capable of,
if you can learn some self-discipline.

05:01.802 --> 05:05.138
Why are we even talking about this?
Nothing is gonna happen to you.

05:05.222 --> 05:08.725
It's just in case.
I need you to get focused.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.645
When you and Allura ran off,
it put us all in jeopardy.

05:11.728 --> 05:14.523
If you're going to be a leader,
you've got to get your head on straight.

05:15.273 --> 05:18.443
I'm sorry. I've just had a lot on my mind.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.446
I know. We all have.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.824
-[grunts]
-[alarm blaring]

05:23.907 --> 05:26.576
[Keith] We're getting drawn in
by one of the black holes!

05:26.660 --> 05:27.661
Get us out of here!

05:42.217 --> 05:45.095
Great job! That was close.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.829
There's nothing here. This place
just looks like a plain asteroid.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.455
[loud rumbling]

06:53.413 --> 06:58.752
I am going to ask you some questions.
I will know if you lie.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.867
I am Kolivan,
leader of the Blade of Marmora.

07:30.951 --> 07:35.789
My name is Shiro and this is Keith.
We are Paladins of Voltron.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.458
[Kolivan] I know who you are.

07:38.541 --> 07:41.252
[Shiro] Then you know we were sent
by one of your own.

07:41.336 --> 07:44.297
[Kolivan] Ulaz was a fool to divulge
this location to you.

07:44.381 --> 07:48.259
He had a penchant for ignoring orders
and following his impulses.

07:48.343 --> 07:50.178
That's what got him killed.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.515
He gave his life to save us!

07:53.598 --> 07:57.185
What he did brought us here today,
and Voltron is ready to assist you.

07:57.268 --> 07:59.020
Are we welcome here or not?

08:00.230 --> 08:02.691
You were told to come unarmed.

08:02.774 --> 08:05.568
You also told us to identify ourselves.

08:05.652 --> 08:08.321
The lions are about as close
as we come to an ID.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.115
If anything happens, believe me,

08:10.198 --> 08:12.450
you'll be happy you have
the Red Lion on your side.

08:12.534 --> 08:17.622
I imagine we would.
However, I wasn't referring to your beast.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.793
[grunting]

08:21.876 --> 08:23.003
Keith!

08:23.837 --> 08:29.092
He has one of our blades!
Who did you steal this from?

08:29.718 --> 08:32.011
I didn't! I've had it all my life!

08:32.095 --> 08:34.014
[guard] Lies!

08:34.097 --> 08:35.765
[Kolivan] Can you corroborate
your friend's statement?

08:35.849 --> 08:38.351
Does this blade truly belong to him?

08:39.686 --> 08:41.520
[Shiro] I... I don't know.

08:42.647 --> 08:46.693
Shiro, you know me.
I promise you I didn't steal it.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.320
I've had this knife
as long as I can remember.

08:49.404 --> 08:53.283
-We can't trust them.
-I'm telling the truth.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.453
I saw Ulaz had a knife like this.
Tell me what it means.

08:56.536 --> 09:00.874
Our organization is built
on secrecy and trust.

09:00.957 --> 09:04.210
You two should leave. Now.

09:08.548 --> 09:13.303
We came here to form an alliance,
but obviously, we're not welcome.

09:13.386 --> 09:17.265
-Come on, Keith, we're leaving.
-Not without some answers.

09:17.348 --> 09:21.770
Somehow, one of your knives ended up
with me on planet Earth. Tell me how.

09:22.604 --> 09:25.523
[Kolivan] Your friend is right.
It is time for you to go.

09:25.607 --> 09:29.027
Where did it come from?
I have to know.

09:30.820 --> 09:35.116
You seek knowledge? There is only
one way to attain knowledge here.

09:35.200 --> 09:39.829
-How? I'll do it!
-The trials of Marmora.

09:39.913 --> 09:45.210
Should you survive, you may keep the blade
and its secrets will be revealed.

09:45.293 --> 09:46.294
Survive?

09:46.377 --> 09:49.631
Keith, this is crazy. If they're not going
to help us, let's get of here.

09:49.714 --> 09:53.927
I'm not going anywhere. I have to do this.

09:54.010 --> 09:57.764
Antok, give the boy the blade.

10:01.684 --> 10:04.187
We will meet again.

10:04.771 --> 10:05.814
Can't wait.

10:07.190 --> 10:10.860
These trials result in one of two things.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.655
Knowledge or death.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.877
Surrender the blade.

10:29.254 --> 10:30.630
You cannot win.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.342
[growls]

10:34.425 --> 10:36.761
[grunting]

10:43.560 --> 10:46.396
[Keith grunting]

10:49.274 --> 10:51.526
[screams, groans]

10:53.778 --> 10:55.697
Come on, Keith.

10:58.700 --> 11:03.037
[grunts, groans]

11:03.121 --> 11:06.708
Surrender the blade
and the pain will cease.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.961
I won't quit.

11:10.044 --> 11:12.005
Then the pain continues.

11:18.761 --> 11:21.598
You are not meant
to go through that door.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.500
This is not a fair fight!

11:49.584 --> 11:53.880
Nor is taking on the Galra,
yet that is the fight we face.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.548
[screams]

11:58.134 --> 12:01.387
Surrender the blade
and the pain will cease.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.056
Never!

12:03.765 --> 12:06.351
You are not meant
to go through that door.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.403
[breathing heavily]

12:25.828 --> 12:27.372
[Shiro]
How long does this go on?

12:27.455 --> 12:30.833
Sometimes, the greatest challenge
is knowing when to stop.

12:30.917 --> 12:35.129
-He'll never quit.
-One way or another, this will end.

12:35.213 --> 12:37.590
Knowledge or death.

12:37.674 --> 12:38.925
[yells]

12:41.135 --> 12:44.472
-[Allura] How long has it been?
-Roughly ten <i>vargas.</i>

12:44.555 --> 12:45.974
We cannot just wait here.

12:46.057 --> 12:49.769
The path is closed for, like,
I don't know, 30 more <i>vargas</i> or something?

12:51.771 --> 12:54.357
-That's actually correct.
-Really?

12:54.440 --> 12:56.776
Yeah, I wasn't born yester-<i>quintant.</i>

12:57.819 --> 12:59.487
I-I have to know
what's going on down there.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.447
There's no way to get
a read on their base.

13:01.531 --> 13:04.534
Too much interference
from the solar flares and the black holes.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.536
If we account
for the gravitational lensing,

13:06.619 --> 13:08.413
maybe we can reduce
the noise and interference

13:08.496 --> 13:10.915
and connect with
the Red Lion's sensors, right?

13:10.999 --> 13:12.625
Th-That's right, right?

13:15.253 --> 13:18.840
-Are you looking at me?
-We can give it a try.

13:19.424 --> 13:20.425
Get on it.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.602
-[electronic beeping]
-[metal clanging]

13:34.230 --> 13:36.107
Haggar wishes to speak with you.

13:45.283 --> 13:47.577
[breathing heavily]

13:59.630 --> 14:00.506
[grunts]

14:14.020 --> 14:15.688
Keith!

14:23.488 --> 14:27.200
Guess I really wasn't supposed
to go through that door. [groans]

14:49.222 --> 14:51.599
Hey, man. You did it.

14:53.017 --> 14:54.102
Shiro?

14:56.938 --> 14:58.272
[grunting]

14:58.856 --> 15:02.902
Kolivan told me you lasted longer
than anyone ever has in those battles.

15:02.985 --> 15:06.781
-You don't have to keep this up.
-What are you talking about?

15:06.864 --> 15:09.200
Just give them the knife
and let's get out of here.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.286
I can't give it to them, Shiro.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.333
Is that a hologram?

15:17.417 --> 15:20.962
His suit has the ability to create
a virtual mindscape,

15:21.045 --> 15:23.923
reflecting its wearer's greatest
hopes and fears.

15:24.006 --> 15:28.553
And, at this moment, your friend
desperately wants to see you.

15:28.636 --> 15:30.638
What is it with you and that thing?

15:31.264 --> 15:34.475
It's the only connection
I have to my past.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.811
It's my chance to learn who I really am.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.857
You know exactly who you are,
a Paladin of Voltron.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.400
We're all the family you need.

15:43.151 --> 15:47.071
Shiro, you're like a brother to me...

15:47.155 --> 15:49.323
but I have to do this.

15:49.407 --> 15:52.577
No, you don't.
So, just give them the knife.

15:52.660 --> 15:56.080
-I can't do that.
-Just give up the knife, Keith!

15:56.164 --> 15:58.499
You're only thinking of yourself,
as usual!

16:01.794 --> 16:03.463
I've made my choice.

16:04.839 --> 16:07.300
Then you've chosen to be alone.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.142
Shiro! Wait!

16:24.317 --> 16:26.152
-[loud rumbling]
-Huh? Huh...

16:26.235 --> 16:27.236
[man]
Keith...

16:28.154 --> 16:30.072
[gasps]
Dad?

16:32.450 --> 16:33.993
You're home, son.

16:35.745 --> 16:38.247
-[loud rumbling]
-What's going on outside?

16:38.331 --> 16:40.041
Don't worry about that.

16:40.124 --> 16:44.128
We'll be fine as long as we stay in here.
Don't you want to catch up?

16:45.505 --> 16:47.548
Of course I do.

16:47.632 --> 16:50.801
[sighs]
Son, so many years have passed.

16:50.885 --> 16:53.554
- I have so much to tell you.
-[loud rumbling]

16:53.638 --> 16:55.056
What is that?

16:56.015 --> 16:57.808
Everything's fine.

17:00.311 --> 17:01.312
[gasps]

17:06.483 --> 17:09.737
[people screaming]

17:09.819 --> 17:13.699
Dad, I-I'm sorry. I gotta go.
There's people that need me out there.

17:13.782 --> 17:18.663
Don't you want to know about where
you came from? Your mother gave it to me.

17:18.746 --> 17:19.914
Mom?

17:19.997 --> 17:21.874
-[loud rumbling]
-[people screaming]

17:29.006 --> 17:30.716
She'll be here soon.

17:30.800 --> 17:34.720
[grunting]

17:39.642 --> 17:43.062
-You need to get him out of there.
-He can decide when to leave.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.731
You're messing with his mind.
You're going to kill him!

17:47.191 --> 17:48.651
Knowledge or death, Shiro.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.572
I'm calling this off.

17:54.282 --> 17:55.908
[groaning]

17:57.910 --> 18:00.871
You gotta tell me, Dad.
I have to know.

18:00.955 --> 18:04.584
Where did the knife come from?
What does it mean?

18:04.667 --> 18:08.337
Your mother is almost here.
She'll tell you everything.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.929
I can't wait around anymore. I have to go.

18:17.722 --> 18:21.350
If you go out that door,
you'll never find out who you are.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.111
Goodbye, Dad.

18:38.159 --> 18:40.161
[roars]

18:41.454 --> 18:44.290
-The Red Lion is moving!
-We gotta get down there!

18:44.915 --> 18:46.542
[Hunk]
It won't be ready for five more minutes.

18:52.298 --> 18:57.970
I am going to ask you some questions.
I will know if you lie.

18:58.054 --> 19:02.391
I have reason to believe that a spy
has infiltrated Galra command.

19:02.475 --> 19:05.227
That is very alarming.

19:05.311 --> 19:09.315
Indeed. Are you aware
of any spies within our ranks?

19:10.024 --> 19:11.025
No.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.988
Commander Thace,

19:16.072 --> 19:19.033
are you the one
who lowered the solar barrier

19:19.116 --> 19:20.701
during the Voltron attack,

19:20.785 --> 19:22.745
allowing it to escape?

19:24.038 --> 19:28.626
No. I fight in the name of Galra.
I am loyal to Zarkon.

19:32.546 --> 19:35.383
You will help me root out this traitor.

19:36.133 --> 19:40.262
We will destroy him
and all who threaten our reign.

19:49.522 --> 19:52.858
The Red Lion is attacking the base!
It's trying to break through!

19:56.362 --> 20:00.825
It has a link with Keith. It knows
when he's in danger. It's coming for him.

20:00.908 --> 20:01.951
[all grunt]

20:06.455 --> 20:08.249
[electronic beeping]

20:08.332 --> 20:10.501
The Red Lion has started attacking!

20:10.584 --> 20:14.797
Wait, what does that mean?
Why would the lion attack? Unless...

20:14.880 --> 20:18.718
-Allura?
-Everyone, stay focused.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.429
[faint rumbling]

20:21.512 --> 20:25.266
-[running footsteps approaching]
-[faint rumbling]

20:27.351 --> 20:30.771
-Keith, are you okay?
-Stop what you're doing!

20:30.855 --> 20:33.983
What are you talking about?
What's going on?

20:36.861 --> 20:40.364
-Call off your beast!
-Move out of the way! We're leaving!

20:40.448 --> 20:42.575
You're not leaving with that blade.

20:42.658 --> 20:45.453
It does not belong to you.
You failed to awaken it!

20:45.536 --> 20:49.290
-What does that mean?
-Give up the blade!

20:49.373 --> 20:50.624
[grunts]

20:50.708 --> 20:53.377
Coran, how much longer
until we can get in?

20:53.461 --> 20:55.713
Just a few more ticks, Princess.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.506
Get ready.

20:58.424 --> 21:01.594
Wait! Just take the knife!

21:04.847 --> 21:08.684
It doesn't matter where I come from.
I know who I am.

21:09.852 --> 21:12.438
We all need to work together
to defeat Zarkon.

21:12.521 --> 21:16.525
If that means I give up
this knife, fine. Take it.

21:18.736 --> 21:19.737
Mm?

21:21.906 --> 21:23.741
You've awoken the blade!

21:35.169 --> 21:40.633
The only way this is possible
is if Galra blood runs through your veins.

21:42.343 --> 21:43.177
[Coran]
<i>Five...</i>

21:44.887 --> 21:45.763
four...

21:46.972 --> 21:47.807
three...

21:48.891 --> 21:49.892
two...

21:50.893 --> 21:51.727
one!

21:52.686 --> 21:54.605
[Shiro]
<i>Princess, we're coming back,</i>

21:54.688 --> 21:56.899
<i>and we're bringing someone</i>
<i>you should meet.</i>

21:56.982 --> 22:00.319
-They're all right!
-Yes, they did it!

22:21.674 --> 22:25.386
Princess Allura, it's good to see
that the rumors are true.

22:25.469 --> 22:28.097
You're still alive after all these years.

22:28.180 --> 22:33.435
So is Zarkon. Can we consider you
our ally in the fight against him?

22:33.519 --> 22:36.188
Yes, but we have little time
to discuss this.

22:36.272 --> 22:40.317
I just received word from our spy
inside the Galran hierarchy.

22:40.401 --> 22:41.986
They have become aware of our presence,

22:42.069 --> 22:44.822
so the timetable for our plan
has been moved up.

22:44.905 --> 22:46.448
How soon do we need to begin?

22:47.074 --> 22:48.158
Now.
