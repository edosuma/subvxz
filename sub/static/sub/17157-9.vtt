[rock music]

00:09.000 --> 00:11.933
- Today I want your
full attention on Pythagoras,

00:11.933 --> 00:14.467
who discovered A squared
plus B squared equals--

00:14.467 --> 00:16.467
- I just got a text
from Battle of the Bands.

00:16.467 --> 00:18.167
- Equals let's talk
about Battle of the Bands.

00:18.167 --> 00:19.600
What's it say?

00:19.600 --> 00:21.133
- The entrance fee
is due in two days.

00:21.133 --> 00:23.733
- Hmm.
- No problem. How much is it?

00:23.733 --> 00:26.233
- $200.
- Problem.

00:26.233 --> 00:28.333
- And we can't even ask
our parents for money.

00:28.333 --> 00:31.067
- That's one of the downsides
of having a secret band.

00:31.067 --> 00:34.967
- Wait, this is a secret band?

00:34.967 --> 00:37.100
Kidding.

00:37.100 --> 00:39.000
- Don't worry, guys,
I've got it covered.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.700
I stashed money in a book
for emergencies like this.

00:43.767 --> 00:45.033
This one?

00:45.033 --> 00:47.267
No. This one?

00:47.267 --> 00:49.367
No.
This one?

00:49.367 --> 00:51.400
Aha!
- Found it?

00:51.400 --> 00:55.567
- No, I'm just a sucker
for Jane Austen.

00:55.567 --> 00:57.300
- Guys,
if we don't raise that money,

00:57.300 --> 00:59.700
we're not gonna get to play
in Battle of the Bands.

00:59.700 --> 01:02.267
- We've all gotta figure out
how to get money ourselves.

01:02.267 --> 01:04.133
And fast.

01:04.133 --> 01:05.367
- What are we going to do?

01:05.367 --> 01:06.867
- We're a band.

01:06.867 --> 01:09.533
We can play on the street
for tips. I've done it.

01:09.533 --> 01:10.767
- Did you make any money?

01:10.767 --> 01:12.700
- I did it for the love
of music.

01:12.700 --> 01:14.467
- So no.

01:16.233 --> 01:17.900
- I've got a better idea.

01:17.900 --> 01:20.600
I'll charge people to watch
my extreme skateboarding tricks.

01:20.600 --> 01:22.733
- Who's gonna pay
to watch you just--

01:28.433 --> 01:30.267
- Too bad I spent
all my birthday money

01:30.267 --> 01:33.700
on these new Dunk Masters.

01:33.700 --> 01:36.833
- Lawrence, you've got
to think like a businessman.

01:36.833 --> 01:39.233
Those sweet kicks
are limited edition.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.900
- I know. They're sold out now.

01:40.900 --> 01:44.433
- Exactly! That's why we can
sell them for double the price.

01:44.433 --> 01:46.767
All you have to do is agree
you're selling them.

01:46.767 --> 01:49.067
- I'm selling them?
- If you insist.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.267
You heard him, everybody.
* For he's a jolly good fellow *

01:51.267 --> 01:52.667
- Wait, what's going on?

01:52.667 --> 01:54.300
- * For he's
a jolly good fellow *

01:54.300 --> 01:56.233
- Why are you singing?
I'm not on board with this!

01:56.233 --> 01:59.667
But come on--
- Sorry, already sang the song.

01:59.667 --> 02:01.533
- That's fair.

02:03.367 --> 02:05.067
- I'll start
a "Text a Cupcake" business.

02:05.067 --> 02:08.233
You text me who you want to send
a cupcake to, and I deliver it.

02:08.233 --> 02:10.267
[cell phone rings]

02:10.267 --> 02:13.767
Sorry, Mr. Finn,
I don't have the cupcakes yet.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.300
- That's cool.

02:15.300 --> 02:16.667
I can wait.

02:16.667 --> 02:18.633
- Guys, the money problem's
solved.

02:18.633 --> 02:20.467
Who wouldn't pay to see this?

02:23.267 --> 02:26.400
[all cheer and applaud]

02:29.300 --> 02:32.667
That's a lovely ensemble.

02:32.667 --> 02:34.767
- Nice try.

02:39.067 --> 02:40.533
- I lost my board.

02:40.533 --> 02:42.867
Do you think anyone would pay
just to see me be me?

02:42.867 --> 02:44.333
- [gasps]

02:50.733 --> 02:53.433
- * Stop tellin' me
to read between the lines *

02:53.433 --> 02:56.067
* It all adds up
to one thing *

02:56.067 --> 02:57.600
- Five, four, three,
two, one.

02:57.600 --> 03:00.067
- * If you think you're gonna
lose your cool *

03:00.067 --> 03:02.833
* Well, sometimes you gotta
break the rules *

03:02.833 --> 03:05.600
* Hey, show me what you know,
give it up to rock 'n' roll *

03:05.600 --> 03:07.967
* 'Cause we ain't
gonna stop *

03:07.967 --> 03:10.767
* If you're feeling like
you're gettin' schooled *

03:10.767 --> 03:13.233
* There's an answer
right in front of you *

03:13.233 --> 03:16.267
* Hey, show me what you know,
give it up to rock 'n' roll *

03:16.267 --> 03:17.767
* 'Cause we ain't
gonna stop *

03:17.767 --> 03:19.533
- * Hey!
- * Are you ready to rock?

03:22.467 --> 03:25.433
[rock music]

03:26.533 --> 03:29.200
- Whoa, this looks like
a real business.

03:29.200 --> 03:32.233
- Yeah, my phone's blowing up
with cupcake orders.

03:32.233 --> 03:33.400
[cell phone rings]

03:33.400 --> 03:34.933
Ooh, another order.

03:34.933 --> 03:36.300
[cell phone rings]

03:36.300 --> 03:37.867
Ooh, another order.
[cell phone rings]

03:37.867 --> 03:39.833
My friend Jennifer's
getting braces--

03:39.833 --> 03:42.767
[cell phone rings]
And she wants a cupcake.

03:42.767 --> 03:45.733
- Well, without my skateboard, I
don't have a way to make money.

03:45.733 --> 03:48.267
Maybe I could work for you?
- Seriously?

03:48.267 --> 03:52.433
I mean, we'll have to work side
by side, 24/7, holding hands--

03:52.433 --> 03:54.067
- What?
- You're hired.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.767
- Great.

03:55.767 --> 03:58.500
- Your first assignment is
to deliver this cupcake

03:58.500 --> 04:01.333
to Laura in room 112
from her best friend, Regina.

04:01.333 --> 04:02.733
- To Laura from Regina.
Got it.

04:02.733 --> 04:04.433
- Oh, my gosh,
this is so exciting.

04:04.433 --> 04:06.100
- I know, our first
cupcake delivery.

04:06.100 --> 04:09.567
- Yeah, that's totally
what I was talking about.

04:09.567 --> 04:12.233
[rock music]

04:12.233 --> 04:13.633
- I don't know, Zack.

04:13.633 --> 04:16.200
I'm still not sure
about selling my Dunk Masters.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.467
- Are you kidding?

04:17.467 --> 04:19.567
What do you need
these dumb sneakers for?

04:19.567 --> 04:22.067
Get the world's most
amazing sneakers here!

04:22.067 --> 04:23.867
Trust me, you need these.

04:23.867 --> 04:25.833
- I've waited so long
to get them,

04:25.833 --> 04:27.733
and now I'm giving them away.

04:27.733 --> 04:29.533
- You're overreacting.

04:29.533 --> 04:31.233
Life-changing sneakers!

04:31.233 --> 04:33.900
If you don't get these,
you'll hate yourself forever!

04:33.900 --> 04:35.533
- I'll give you 10 bucks
more than you paid.

04:35.533 --> 04:38.500
- This is all happening
too fast.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.433
- Believe me,
these shoes are worthless.

04:40.433 --> 04:43.600
Seriously,
the best shoes ever!

04:43.600 --> 04:45.333
- So you won't sell them?

04:45.333 --> 04:47.367
- Oops, got 'em mixed up.

04:47.367 --> 04:50.933
Come back when you're ready
to make a serious offer.

04:50.933 --> 04:52.433
Just wait.

04:52.433 --> 04:54.433
He'll be begging
to pay double for them.

04:54.433 --> 04:57.433
- Oh, man, they are awesome.

04:57.433 --> 04:59.567
I'll pay triple.
Final offer.

04:59.567 --> 05:02.567
- Lawrence,
you can't afford these.

05:02.567 --> 05:05.367
- But they're my shoes.

05:05.367 --> 05:08.267
- It's a bad system,
but it's the best we got.

05:08.267 --> 05:11.767
[rock music]

05:11.767 --> 05:13.867
- Oh.
- Oops.

05:13.867 --> 05:15.433
Five-second rule
says I pick it up

05:15.433 --> 05:17.400
and I can still deliver it.

05:17.400 --> 05:20.200
- That cupcake fell in gum.

05:20.200 --> 05:23.267
- [laughs]
Good save.

05:23.267 --> 05:25.067
[grunts]

05:25.067 --> 05:28.100
Luckily, the person who
ordered this will never know.

05:28.100 --> 05:31.067
Oh...this is awkward.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.433
[rock music]

05:35.433 --> 05:36.800
- Tomika, I'm so glad

05:36.800 --> 05:38.567
you decided to give
street performing a try.

05:38.567 --> 05:39.833
- Mm.
[mumbling]

05:39.833 --> 05:42.767
- Now, the trick is
to find a busy spot.

05:42.767 --> 05:46.067
- [grunts] This seems busy.
- Mm.

05:48.667 --> 05:50.367
- I have the perfect song
I wanna sing.

05:50.367 --> 05:51.600
- That's important,

05:51.600 --> 05:53.233
because if you
believe in yourself

05:53.233 --> 05:54.733
and sing from the heart,

05:54.733 --> 05:58.733
nobody could possibly
walk away from you.

05:58.733 --> 06:02.367
- * I used to wanna be--
- Gotta go.

06:02.367 --> 06:03.367
- Where are you going?

06:03.367 --> 06:04.600
- To get you a bigger tip jar.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.067
I used to use a jelly jar

06:06.067 --> 06:08.133
but stopped
because of the sticky money.

06:08.133 --> 06:10.067
Also, the bees.

06:11.833 --> 06:14.433
- * I used to wanna be

06:14.433 --> 06:16.100
* Living like there's only me *

06:16.100 --> 06:17.633
Hi, you two look like
a happy couple.

06:17.633 --> 06:19.533
Bigger tip jar coming.

06:19.533 --> 06:21.100
* But now I spend my time

06:21.100 --> 06:24.167
* Thinking about a way
to get you off my mind *

06:24.167 --> 06:25.300
Hey!

06:25.300 --> 06:28.067
Uh, hey, folks,
how about a sing-along?

06:28.067 --> 06:30.500
When I say "hey," you say "ho."

06:30.500 --> 06:31.800
Hey!

06:33.867 --> 06:34.967
Hey!

06:37.300 --> 06:38.933
Ho!

06:40.600 --> 06:43.800
[rock music]

06:43.800 --> 06:45.933
- Ooh. Thanks
for coming in early, Freddy.

06:45.933 --> 06:48.300
- No problem.
- I believe in lots of meetings.

06:48.300 --> 06:52.433
Before school, after school,
every Saturday night.

06:52.433 --> 06:55.067
- Sometimes I go to the movies
on Saturday nights.

06:55.067 --> 06:57.933
- That works for me.
Pick me up at 8:00.

06:57.933 --> 07:00.533
- Summer, the cupcake I ordered
for Laura

07:00.533 --> 07:02.733
was delivered to me.

07:02.733 --> 07:05.800
And it looks like
somebody sat on it.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.900
- Freddy, what happened
to Regina's cupcake order?

07:07.900 --> 07:11.933
- I think Regina here
explained it pretty clearly.

07:11.933 --> 07:13.733
- I will happily
refund your money

07:13.733 --> 07:17.633
and deliver a proper cupcake
to Laura free of charge.

07:17.633 --> 07:19.100
- But then we're losing money.

07:19.100 --> 07:21.567
- Freddy, the customer
is always right.

07:21.567 --> 07:23.200
- You should fire him.
- Wrong!

07:23.200 --> 07:25.967
What do you know?
You're just a customer.

07:25.967 --> 07:28.667
- Thanks, Summer. I'm glad
my hard work is appreciated.

07:28.667 --> 07:29.967
- [sighs]

07:34.667 --> 07:37.700
[rock music]

07:37.700 --> 07:40.100
- Zack,
I need those Dunk Masters.

07:40.100 --> 07:42.433
- I knew you'd come
crawling back,

07:42.433 --> 07:43.900
but the price has gone up.

07:43.900 --> 07:46.167
- Whatever, just hook me up.

07:47.933 --> 07:51.567
- Where are the Dunk Masters?

07:51.567 --> 07:53.967
- Make way for the Dunk Master!

07:53.967 --> 07:57.067
- No! You can't wear those.
We're selling them!

07:57.067 --> 07:58.933
What about Battle of the Bands?

07:58.933 --> 08:00.867
- I feel bad about that,

08:00.867 --> 08:03.500
but I feel great
about my ability to Slama Jama.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.733
- Hand 'em over.
- You'll never catch me!

08:05.733 --> 08:06.867
I run like the wind in these!

08:06.867 --> 08:09.067
- Wh--
- [grunts]

08:10.767 --> 08:12.233
[bell rings]

08:16.633 --> 08:19.900
- No!

08:19.900 --> 08:21.567
- Take off those shoes,
Lawrence.

08:21.567 --> 08:23.133
- Fine, you can have them,

08:23.133 --> 08:26.667
but you should know,
my heart will be broken.

08:26.667 --> 08:28.133
[both scoff]

08:29.533 --> 08:30.933
[rock music]

08:30.933 --> 08:32.367
- How did street performing go,
Tomeeks?

08:32.367 --> 08:34.800
- We did okay.
- I didn't make a single penny.

08:34.800 --> 08:36.933
- I've done worse.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.100
- How'd you do, Sum?
- I made $70.

08:39.100 --> 08:40.600
- Yeah.
- Ooh, sweet.

08:40.600 --> 08:43.100
- After all the refunds,
20.

08:43.100 --> 08:44.767
both: Oh.

08:44.767 --> 08:47.267
- Wait, you give refunds?

08:47.267 --> 08:50.833
The cupcake I ordered for myself
had a bite taken out of it.

08:50.833 --> 08:53.400
- Really?
Let me see it.

08:53.400 --> 08:56.900
- Yeah, I'd show you,
but I ate it anyway.

08:56.900 --> 08:59.133
- No evidence, no refunds.
- [groans]

08:59.133 --> 09:00.867
- Freddy,
what were you thinking?

09:00.867 --> 09:03.367
- Uh...
you're an excellent boss.

09:03.367 --> 09:05.500
- Aww.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.200
- Our contribution.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.233
- Wow, this is a lot of money.

09:09.233 --> 09:11.900
- You can thank
my man Lawrence.

09:15.667 --> 09:16.867
- Am I a hero?

09:16.867 --> 09:18.700
That's for others to say,

09:18.700 --> 09:20.533
but the answer is yes.

09:20.533 --> 09:21.967
- Is that my lunch box?

09:21.967 --> 09:25.967
- Like you said,
we all have to make sacrifices.

09:25.967 --> 09:29.867
By the way, if your tuna fish
didn't already taste like feet,

09:29.867 --> 09:32.467
it will now.

09:32.467 --> 09:34.567
- Guys, this puts us
way over the top.

09:34.567 --> 09:36.833
We made the entry fee
a day ahead of deadline.

09:36.833 --> 09:38.500
- We're going to Battle
of the Bands!

09:38.500 --> 09:40.833
all: Yeah!
- Whoo!

09:40.833 --> 09:42.967
- We even have tons
of extra money.

09:42.967 --> 09:45.467
- Oh, do you think we could buy
some new guitar strings?

09:45.467 --> 09:47.467
- Well, if it's for the band,
I guess you can take

09:47.467 --> 09:48.700
a few bucks
out of the band bank.

09:48.700 --> 09:50.067
- [laughs]

09:50.067 --> 09:51.867
- If I take a dollar
to buy another cupcake,

09:51.867 --> 09:54.267
that dollar goes right back
in the bank.

09:54.267 --> 09:56.233
- Fine, here is your cupcake.

09:56.233 --> 09:57.567
- Yes.

09:57.567 --> 09:59.700
Mm.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.767
- Seriously?

10:01.767 --> 10:03.433
[rock music]

10:03.433 --> 10:06.867
Tomika, I took a few bucks
from the band bank last night,

10:06.867 --> 10:08.100
and look what I bought.

10:08.100 --> 10:10.467
Matching vests
for me and Freddy.

10:10.467 --> 10:12.700
- Why do you still
have the cupcake business?

10:12.700 --> 10:14.033
We don't need the money anymore.

10:14.033 --> 10:16.933
- Yeah, but if I close
the business,

10:16.933 --> 10:18.800
I can't take Freddy
to the company picnic.

10:18.800 --> 10:21.133
- [scoffs]

10:21.133 --> 10:23.000
- You said we're only supposed
to take money

10:23.000 --> 10:25.367
out of the band bank
for band-related purposes.

10:25.367 --> 10:28.033
- Mm. Like those new
skateboard pads?

10:29.467 --> 10:33.467
- These are...bass player pads.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.367
[mimics bass]

10:35.367 --> 10:37.933
- Hey, you know what else
those could be good for?

10:37.933 --> 10:40.300
Skateboarding.

10:40.300 --> 10:41.933
- Well, the band bank
will be fine,

10:41.933 --> 10:44.567
as long as nobody else
buys anything stupid.

10:44.567 --> 10:45.800
- Yeah.

10:47.967 --> 10:49.733
- What's that, Mr. Finn?

10:49.733 --> 10:51.267
- I got this for the band.

10:51.267 --> 10:54.200
- Can I try it?
- Go away. It's mine.

10:54.200 --> 10:57.033
- You didn't use
the band money, did you?

10:57.033 --> 10:58.700
- Summer said we had extra,
so I figured

10:58.700 --> 11:00.833
if I'm the only one who dips in,
it couldn't hurt.

11:00.833 --> 11:03.067
- [sighs]
You're not the only one.

11:03.067 --> 11:05.333
Summer bought ridiculous vests.

11:05.333 --> 11:08.833
- Look who's talking, kneepads.

11:13.633 --> 11:15.100
- What's that?

11:15.100 --> 11:17.100
- I happened to come
into some money recently,

11:17.100 --> 11:20.500
so I ordered a turducken,
which I thought was a pet

11:20.500 --> 11:23.267
until it got here.

11:23.267 --> 11:24.867
- A turducken is a turkey

11:24.867 --> 11:27.333
stuffed with a duck
stuffed with a chicken.

11:27.333 --> 11:28.700
You eat it.

11:28.700 --> 11:32.067
- Well, I know that now,
but I already bought the cage.

11:32.067 --> 11:33.833
I named him Daryl.

11:33.833 --> 11:36.400
He's quiet but loyal.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.400
- You used the band money,
didn't you?

11:38.400 --> 11:41.700
- I'll never tell,
and neither will Daryl.

11:41.700 --> 11:44.633
- [voice shaking]
Can you guys keep it down?

11:44.633 --> 11:47.100
I'm trying to relax.

11:48.967 --> 11:50.467
- You bought a massage chair?

11:50.467 --> 11:53.967
- [voice shaking]
Chairs. Check it out.

11:53.967 --> 11:57.067
It massages and moves!

11:57.067 --> 11:59.267
- Oh, my gosh.
How much did we spend?

11:59.267 --> 12:02.067
Do we have anything left
for the entry fee?

12:06.800 --> 12:09.667
[both scream]

12:09.667 --> 12:11.267
both: Best friend scream!

12:11.267 --> 12:13.333
- We're in trouble here!

12:13.333 --> 12:15.267
- What are we going to do
about Battle of the Bands?

12:15.267 --> 12:18.900
The fee is due by 5:00 today,
and we only have $1 left.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.800
- I need a refund.
My cupcake has hair in it.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.100
- One little hair?

12:24.100 --> 12:26.933
We don't give refunds for--

12:29.067 --> 12:31.200
Here's your dollar back.

12:32.933 --> 12:35.933
- Great, now we're
completely broke.

12:38.067 --> 12:41.167
- So...is the hair cupcake
up for grabs?

12:46.067 --> 12:47.733
[rock music]

12:47.733 --> 12:50.133
- I can't believe we made all of
these irresponsible purchases.

12:50.133 --> 12:52.467
- Yeah, it's really
stressing me out.

12:54.533 --> 12:55.833
Ah.

12:55.833 --> 12:57.533
- Summer said we could get stuff
for the band.

12:57.533 --> 12:59.733
- You said you needed
guitar strings.

12:59.733 --> 13:02.133
You bought massage chairs.

13:02.133 --> 13:04.133
- Okay, I'm going
to be straight with you.

13:04.133 --> 13:06.167
I'm not to be trusted.

13:06.167 --> 13:08.733
- We didn't think anybody else
was gonna dip into the bank.

13:08.733 --> 13:11.567
- Guys, we have to come up
with 200 bucks by 5:00,

13:11.567 --> 13:14.233
or we have to say good-bye
to Battle of the Bands.

13:14.233 --> 13:17.267
I really think we should get
on the streets and sing.

13:17.267 --> 13:19.867
- I tried that,
but the Golden Statue Guy

13:19.867 --> 13:21.200
took all the business.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.867
- Tomika, don't give up.

13:22.867 --> 13:24.433
Trust the music.

13:24.433 --> 13:26.933
You just need a way
to get the crowd's attention.

13:26.933 --> 13:29.700
- There's got to be a way
we can use the stuff we bought

13:29.700 --> 13:31.433
to make some money.

13:31.433 --> 13:32.867
- There is.

13:32.867 --> 13:35.200
There's only one thing
kids love more than ice cream.

13:35.200 --> 13:37.833
It's turducken.

13:37.833 --> 13:40.967
- Or what about massage chair
races after school?

13:40.967 --> 13:43.100
We can sell tickets.

13:43.100 --> 13:45.533
- And I can make money
with "Text a Cupcake,"

13:45.533 --> 13:50.067
but only if I resolve our...
delivery issues.

13:50.067 --> 13:53.500
- Yeah, we've gotta figure out
the flaw in the system.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.500
- Listen, Freddy, I didn't
want it to come to this,

13:56.500 --> 13:58.233
but I have to make
some tough decisions.

13:58.233 --> 14:03.600
You're fi...

14:03.600 --> 14:05.800
nally getting the promotion
you deserve!

14:05.800 --> 14:08.600
- Yeah.
You know what I just realized?

14:08.600 --> 14:11.733
Everything always
works out for me.

14:13.267 --> 14:16.233
[rock music]

14:16.233 --> 14:17.733
- Thanks for coming, Mr. Finn,

14:17.733 --> 14:19.467
but I don't know
if it's gonna work.

14:19.467 --> 14:23.567
- Tomika, I'm telling you,
music is the answer,

14:23.567 --> 14:26.800
and we're not afraid
of some two-bit talentless sta--

14:28.833 --> 14:31.400
How does he not move?

14:31.400 --> 14:34.067
- Mr. Finn!
- Sorry.

14:34.067 --> 14:36.933
He's just so good.

14:36.933 --> 14:38.433
But we're good too,

14:38.433 --> 14:40.667
and we don't need to resort
to cheap gimmicks

14:40.667 --> 14:43.933
to make our money.

14:43.933 --> 14:45.700
- Yeah. Not us.

14:45.700 --> 14:48.633
- Power up.
[electricity whirs]

14:48.633 --> 14:50.433
Hat me.

14:54.533 --> 14:56.200
Guitars.

15:00.133 --> 15:04.267
- Okay, Mr. Finn, let's jam.

15:04.267 --> 15:06.633
* I used to wanna be

15:06.633 --> 15:09.500
* Living like there's only me *

15:09.500 --> 15:10.767
[electricity surges]
* But now I spend my time--

15:10.767 --> 15:14.633
- Uh-oh, my pants
are shorting out.

15:14.633 --> 15:18.267
Now I look like an idiot.

15:18.267 --> 15:20.467
I'll be right back.

15:20.467 --> 15:22.067
- Where are you going?

15:22.067 --> 15:24.433
- To get my pogo stick!

15:26.100 --> 15:28.500
- * I used to wanna be

15:28.500 --> 15:31.267
* Living like there's on-- *
Thank you.

15:31.267 --> 15:32.900
* But now I spend my time

15:32.900 --> 15:36.067
* Thinking about a way
to get you off my mind *

15:36.067 --> 15:39.167
Hey, you stole my tip jar.

15:39.167 --> 15:40.667
- How could I steal
your tip jar?

15:40.667 --> 15:44.300
I don't move.
I'm a sta--

15:44.300 --> 15:45.700
- I get it.

15:45.700 --> 15:47.633
You don't move
when someone's watching.

15:47.633 --> 15:51.500
I'll take that.
- Give me that ba--

15:51.500 --> 15:53.800
- Haha, you're never
gonna catch me.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.267
- Oh, no?

15:55.267 --> 15:56.733
- Uh-oh.

15:58.867 --> 16:01.667
- Tomika, we got this!

16:01.667 --> 16:02.633
Tomika?

16:02.633 --> 16:06.733
Oh, no, open manhole!

16:06.733 --> 16:09.967
[rock music]

16:09.967 --> 16:11.500
[indistinct chatter]

16:11.500 --> 16:14.267
- I can't believe
people are paying $5

16:14.267 --> 16:16.467
to watch us race
our massage chairs.

16:16.467 --> 16:18.333
How fast do you think
these things go?

16:18.333 --> 16:20.067
- [laughs]
I don't know, but I'm ready.

16:20.067 --> 16:22.167
I put in extra gel.

16:22.167 --> 16:24.300
- Ticket prices are good,
but we're gonna have to

16:24.300 --> 16:26.933
jack up the cupcake prices.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.233
- They're done.

16:34.233 --> 16:36.167
- Oh. You cooked your turducken?
- Yep.

16:36.167 --> 16:39.533
I seasoned it with rosemary,
basted it in olive oil,

16:39.533 --> 16:42.500
and gave it
a sad handshake good-bye.

16:42.500 --> 16:43.833
- I'm really sorry.

16:43.833 --> 16:46.767
Maybe we should have
a moment of silence.

16:46.767 --> 16:49.233
Turducken tacos, $2!

16:51.367 --> 16:53.367
Let the race begin.

16:53.367 --> 16:55.900
Gentlemen,
start your massagers.

16:55.900 --> 16:58.400
[buttons beep]
[massagers humming]

16:58.400 --> 17:00.400
- [voice shaking]
It is on.

17:00.400 --> 17:02.833
- [voice shaking]
So on.

17:02.833 --> 17:07.867
- On your marks,
get set, relax!

17:07.867 --> 17:09.400
- Whoo!

17:09.400 --> 17:11.267
- This is awesome!
- Yeah!

17:11.267 --> 17:13.667
- I tell you, Summer,
Zack looks like he's got

17:13.667 --> 17:15.067
the heart of a champion today.

17:15.067 --> 17:16.433
- [gasps]
Look at Freddy go!

17:16.433 --> 17:18.067
- And his hair
isn't even moving.

17:18.067 --> 17:21.633
How does he do it?
How does he do it?

17:23.067 --> 17:25.633
- I can't steer this thing.
I'm gonna crash.

17:25.633 --> 17:27.800
- Me too.
- There's only one way out.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.600
Set it to tingle!
- I can't.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.667
I'm so relaxed,
my arm fell asleep.

17:31.667 --> 17:37.067
- The overpriced snacks--
I'll save them!

17:37.067 --> 17:38.400
[power shorts]

17:38.400 --> 17:39.933
- Oh.
- [gasps]

17:39.933 --> 17:41.167
- I guess I overreacted.

17:41.167 --> 17:42.633
No harm done.
- Hmm.

17:46.700 --> 17:49.500
- For the love
of William B. Travis,

17:49.500 --> 17:51.833
what is going on here?

17:51.833 --> 17:55.833
- You've got
a little something...here.

17:57.567 --> 18:00.433
- You are all in big trouble.

18:00.433 --> 18:02.367
- Principal Mullins,
have a seat.

18:02.367 --> 18:03.900
You'll feel better.
- No, no.

18:03.900 --> 18:06.400
I do not think that anything
is gonna make me feel--

18:06.400 --> 18:08.267
[gasps]
Ooh.

18:08.267 --> 18:11.167
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, that's it.

18:11.167 --> 18:13.133
Oh. You're still in trouble.

18:13.133 --> 18:16.500
I'm going to have to--ah,
have to confiscate these chairs.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.067
Boys, take them away.

18:18.067 --> 18:20.667
- To the confiscation closet?
- No, no.

18:20.667 --> 18:25.067
To my office 'cause I need to
keep an eye on 'em.

18:25.067 --> 18:27.467
- Well, at least we still
made some pretty good money.

18:27.467 --> 18:30.767
- And everybody
gets their money back!

18:32.133 --> 18:34.167
[rock music]

18:34.167 --> 18:36.700
- [sighs]

18:36.700 --> 18:39.567
If anybody asks,
I fell off my motorcycle

18:39.567 --> 18:43.500
saving a puppy from a bear.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.800
- Ooh. What happened to you?

18:45.800 --> 18:48.833
- He pogo sticked
into an open manhole.

18:48.833 --> 18:51.067
- Saving a puppy from a bear.

18:52.533 --> 18:55.200
- Please tell me you guys
made more money than us.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.833
- How much did you make?

18:56.833 --> 18:58.100
- $0.

18:58.100 --> 18:59.767
- We made less.

18:59.767 --> 19:03.100
- A sewer rat ran off
with my wallet.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.667
- I can't believe we won't get
to play in Battle of the Bands.

19:05.667 --> 19:09.433
- We worked so hard
for nothing.

19:09.433 --> 19:13.067
- I don't get it.
How did music fail us?

19:13.067 --> 19:15.800
- I didn't even get
to play my song.

[applause]
- Yeah! All right, guys!

20:48.667 --> 20:50.800
That was awesome.

20:53.500 --> 20:57.667
[rock music]

20:57.667 --> 21:00.333
Dude, that's gotta be close
to 200 bucks.

21:00.333 --> 21:01.900
- Mr. Finn, you were right.

21:01.900 --> 21:03.433
Music was the answer.

21:03.433 --> 21:05.333
- We were doing it wrong
all along.

21:05.333 --> 21:07.600
We were all trying to do
our own thing to make money,

21:07.600 --> 21:10.167
when all we had to do
is do what we do best.

21:10.167 --> 21:11.700
Play music together.

21:11.700 --> 21:12.800
- That's right.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.733
That is the lesson here.

21:14.733 --> 21:17.433
And that I was right.

21:17.433 --> 21:18.867
- Guys, bad news.

21:18.867 --> 21:20.267
We're still $15 short.

21:20.267 --> 21:23.567
- What? No!
The deadline's in ten minutes.

21:23.567 --> 21:26.833
- I can't take
this emotional roller coaster.

21:26.833 --> 21:28.267
- Wait.

21:28.267 --> 21:30.200
A bunch of girls tipped me
when I delivered their cupcakes.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.500
- Ooh!

21:33.300 --> 21:34.967
- We did it!
all: Yes!

21:34.967 --> 21:36.700
- Wait, you made
that much in tips?

21:36.700 --> 21:38.900
How did you do that?
- I don't know.

21:38.900 --> 21:41.067
How you doing, ma'am?

21:42.967 --> 21:45.967
- Oh, right.

21:45.967 --> 21:47.800
- We've got to get the money
down to the club.

21:47.800 --> 21:50.267
It's four blocks from here.

21:50.267 --> 21:51.700
- Don't worry.

21:51.700 --> 21:53.700
I'm on it.

21:53.700 --> 21:55.567
- Yeah, that's a bad idea.

21:55.567 --> 21:57.700
We should just run.
