00:55.972 --> 00:58.873
Come on, Ray.
Where are you?

01:15.224 --> 01:17.191
I'm coming, Jonathan.

01:22.264 --> 01:24.065
Hold the door.
Hold the door.

01:25.467 --> 01:27.334
Hey hey hey!

01:27.368 --> 01:29.536
Oh, hi.

01:37.044 --> 01:39.312
I've always had this thing
where I kind of want to just

01:39.346 --> 01:42.214
grab a policeman's gun.

01:42.249 --> 01:45.184
Kind of like a mental
Tourette's that I don't act on.

01:45.218 --> 01:48.253
I think it's the way
it kind of just protrudes.

01:48.287 --> 01:50.755
It's like, "touch me.
Touch me."

01:50.790 --> 01:53.157
- And you can't, you know?
- Have you been drinking?

01:53.192 --> 01:55.560
No sir.
No.

01:56.728 --> 01:59.229
This is my floor.
Thank you.

02:09.573 --> 02:10.973
Building inspector.

02:14.577 --> 02:16.111
Yes?

02:16.146 --> 02:19.014
It's been reported that you have a
safety violation by your window.

02:19.048 --> 02:21.016
The co-op board
is going to fine you.

02:21.050 --> 02:23.018
Wait, what?
Reported?

02:23.052 --> 02:26.821
I have to violate your inspection.
It's a matter of codes.

02:26.856 --> 02:28.857
- Wait.
- Yeah.

02:30.559 --> 02:33.195
- Todd, what's going on?
- There's some kind of window problem.

02:33.229 --> 02:36.131
- He's from the co-op board.
- But it's after midnight.

02:36.165 --> 02:38.800
That's the most dangerous
time of night for windows.

02:38.834 --> 02:41.135
I'll only be a second, okay?

02:47.241 --> 02:50.343
- Jonathan!
- Ray! Thank God.

02:50.377 --> 02:52.575
Okay, just drop
down to the ledge.

02:52.609 --> 02:55.110
- I'll catch you.
- No, I'll die.

02:55.144 --> 02:57.645
Yeah, maybe.

02:57.680 --> 02:59.447
- Maybe?
- But I won't let you.

02:59.481 --> 03:01.583
I've been carrying
Spencer all day.

03:01.617 --> 03:04.519
I'll catch you.
I am a father now.

03:04.553 --> 03:05.819
Okay.

03:05.854 --> 03:08.188
Whoa!
Oh, Ray!

03:08.222 --> 03:10.190
I got you! I got you!
I got you! I got you!

03:11.626 --> 03:15.495
Oh God, thank you.
Thank you, Ray.

03:15.530 --> 03:17.831
Ray, thank you.
Thank you so much, Ray.

03:17.866 --> 03:20.334
What the hell is going on?
I'm calling the cops.

03:20.368 --> 03:23.136
No no no no, that's not necessary.
Thank you.

03:23.170 --> 03:26.673
Your window's fine.
I'll tell the co-op board, okay?

03:29.410 --> 03:31.810
Here's $11 for your trouble.
Sorry.

03:41.518 --> 03:44.051
Ray, I'm not complaining,
but what took so long?

03:44.086 --> 03:46.555
- I almost died up there.
- Sorry, I was getting some action from Leah.

03:46.589 --> 03:49.258
You know what I'm up against.
She has the sex drive of a cicada.

03:49.293 --> 03:50.794
I couldn't turn it down.

03:50.828 --> 03:53.362
I was hanging on that clock for
an hour and you just had sex?

03:53.397 --> 03:56.899
Yeah, it was great. I got her to soak
her nipples in whiskey and nurse me.

03:56.933 --> 04:00.168
Come on, two of my most favorite things in the world.
Hope I don't get a DUI.

04:00.202 --> 04:03.603
Well, drunk driving is the least
of our problems right now.

04:03.637 --> 04:05.371
Okay, you're right.
Start from the beginning.

04:05.406 --> 04:07.073
How did you get framed
for murder?

04:07.108 --> 04:09.209
And then when I came to,
my pants were at my ankles

04:09.243 --> 04:11.510
and the gun was in my hand.
Next thing I know

04:11.545 --> 04:13.412
the cops are banging
on the door but I got away.

04:13.446 --> 04:16.047
Lord.
Are you making this up?

04:16.081 --> 04:19.048
No. I don't know why my pants
were at my ankles.

04:19.084 --> 04:21.952
Have you tried to go to the bathroom?
Are you sore?

04:21.986 --> 04:25.122
Ray, don't be mean.
This is the worst night of my life.

04:25.156 --> 04:26.689
Mean?
It's a legitimate question.

04:26.723 --> 04:28.991
If you were sexually
assaulted while unconscious,

04:29.025 --> 04:31.527
- I would like to know.
- Sorry.

04:31.561 --> 04:34.330
Listen, I just think you
should go to the police

04:34.364 --> 04:36.464
- and tell them everything you know.
- I can't do that.

04:36.499 --> 04:39.167
I could be in Rikers for months
before my name is cleared.

04:39.201 --> 04:41.435
And I've got a lot of blog
interviews to do for my book.

04:41.470 --> 04:44.371
Yeah, but if you were at
Rikers it could help sales.

04:44.406 --> 04:46.840
That's true.

04:46.874 --> 04:49.609
But I'm supposed to be on "The
New Dick Cavett Show" next week.

04:49.643 --> 04:52.344
- I don't want to miss that.
- No no, forget cavett.

04:52.378 --> 04:54.946
Turn yourself in.
It's the most sane course of action.

04:54.980 --> 04:57.781
I can't. I have a natural
tendency towards guilt.

04:57.815 --> 05:00.383
I might freak out and make
a false confession.

05:00.418 --> 05:01.918
Also you fled
the scene of a crime.

05:01.952 --> 05:03.386
Innocent men do not run.

05:03.421 --> 05:06.656
My God, you're right.
I might go to prison.

05:06.690 --> 05:09.590
- Oh God.
- All right, all right, listen, you two.

05:09.623 --> 05:11.657
Look, let's just go to bed.

05:11.691 --> 05:13.658
I read in a spy novel once

05:13.693 --> 05:16.728
the fugitive's most
effective weapon is sleep.

05:16.762 --> 05:18.696
We'll figure this
all out in the morning.

05:18.730 --> 05:21.732
Sleep? I'm too upset to sleep.
I've just shattered my life.

05:21.766 --> 05:24.934
All right, Jonathan.
I'll put on the vaporizer.

05:24.969 --> 05:26.936
I also have some valium.

05:26.970 --> 05:29.505
It's a mixture I've been
playing around with lately.

05:29.539 --> 05:31.974
- Could be comforting.
- <i>Also it's not too bad</i>

05:32.008 --> 05:34.409
if you top it off with
just a sip of Prosecco.

05:34.444 --> 05:37.012
Sounds like a pot-head's BLT.
I like it.

05:37.046 --> 05:39.982
Come here. Let me take care of you.
Come on.

05:42.252 --> 05:44.452
My thoughts feel buttery.

05:44.486 --> 05:47.220
Hey, can we do high-lows?

05:47.254 --> 05:50.055
Leah and I do that
when we tuck her girls in.

05:50.089 --> 05:52.423
Sure, Ray.
You go first.

05:52.457 --> 05:55.992
Well, my high was
breastfeeding Spencer

05:56.027 --> 05:58.495
and being nursed by Leah.

05:58.529 --> 06:01.864
And I didn't have a low.
Your turn, George.

06:01.898 --> 06:04.466
My high was seeing Emily.

06:04.501 --> 06:07.135
My low was her boyfriend

06:07.169 --> 06:09.604
who was wearing
a bicycle leotard

06:09.638 --> 06:12.339
and asking permission
to marry her.

06:12.374 --> 06:14.808
But that's wonderful
news, George.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.309
It isn't.

06:16.344 --> 06:19.278
He's nearly 60.
He's way too old for her.

06:19.313 --> 06:21.980
I might sleep with
a woman half my age,

06:22.015 --> 06:24.049
but I'd never marry her.

06:24.083 --> 06:26.517
Well, from one father
to another,

06:26.552 --> 06:29.919
I think that's a reasonable
position to take.

06:29.987 --> 06:31.754
Mmm.

06:31.788 --> 06:33.288
Your turn, Jonathan.

06:33.323 --> 06:36.624
Well, in the last 24 hours

06:36.659 --> 06:39.527
I found out that I came from a sperm
bank in fair lawn, New Jersey,

06:39.561 --> 06:40.996
and I've been framed
for murder.

06:41.030 --> 06:42.831
You're supposed
to say, "my high was."

06:42.865 --> 06:44.632
I don't feel like playing
a game right now, Ray.

06:44.666 --> 06:46.900
I'm in real trouble.

06:46.935 --> 06:49.870
The universe is punishing me
for having my book out.

06:49.905 --> 06:52.775
No, you shouldn't
think like that.

06:52.809 --> 06:55.111
The universe
doesn't care about books.

06:55.145 --> 06:59.181
Okay, let's go to sleep.

06:59.215 --> 07:01.650
Everything will be all right
in the morning.

07:08.123 --> 07:10.857
No spooning, Ray.

07:21.066 --> 07:23.000
No spooning, Ray.

07:23.035 --> 07:26.002
I can't fall asleep
unless I hold someone.

07:28.371 --> 07:30.673
All right, Ray.

07:32.476 --> 07:34.076
Good night, boys.

07:34.111 --> 07:36.445
Good night, George.

07:47.656 --> 07:50.557
Oh, thank you.
Good morning.

07:50.592 --> 07:52.359
<i>Mr. Christopher,</i>
<i>there are police here.</i>

07:52.394 --> 07:54.161
<i>They want to come up</i>
<i>and see you.</i>

07:54.195 --> 07:57.163
What?
Well, stall them.

07:57.198 --> 08:00.332
Offer them scones.
The police are downstairs at the restaurant.

08:00.367 --> 08:01.901
They're coming up
to talk to me.

08:01.935 --> 08:05.004
These guys are
really good detectives..

08:05.038 --> 08:07.006
I had a beautiful dream
about a gumball machine.

08:07.040 --> 08:09.308
- Can I tell you about it?
- Not now, Ray.

08:09.342 --> 08:10.975
Oh, jeez.

08:18.315 --> 08:20.948
Ray, get out of bed!
We've got to hide!

08:22.517 --> 08:24.684
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

08:24.719 --> 08:27.754
Hide. No no.
They'll see you there.

08:27.788 --> 08:29.788
Here here.
Get in the dumbwaiter.

08:29.823 --> 08:31.656
It goes down to the restaurant's kitchen.
Go on, get in.

08:31.691 --> 08:34.359
The scones didn't work.

08:34.393 --> 08:37.195
Okay okay, it's best to
act totally innocently.

08:37.229 --> 08:39.462
I got that from
the same spy novel.

08:39.498 --> 08:41.065
Hey, fellas.

08:41.099 --> 08:42.698
Come on up.
Fifth floor.

08:42.732 --> 08:44.601
I'll leave the door open.

08:44.635 --> 08:47.003
- Why am I fleeing?
- 'Cause you're a good friend.

08:47.071 --> 08:48.338
It's too early
to be a good friend.

08:48.372 --> 08:50.240
I'll try to keep
the police busy

08:50.274 --> 08:52.242
and then I'll catch up
with you two later.

08:52.276 --> 08:55.578
George, George. We need shoes for
running and phones for communicating.

08:55.613 --> 08:57.613
Why didn't you--

08:58.548 --> 08:59.915
Hurry.

08:59.949 --> 09:01.516
All right.

09:01.551 --> 09:03.551
Here's some spending money too.

09:03.585 --> 09:05.619
We'll meet up later.
Make sure you're not followed.

09:05.654 --> 09:07.154
They might tail you
to get to me.

09:07.188 --> 09:09.458
- Really?
- Come on.

09:12.363 --> 09:14.730
Oh hey, fellas.

09:14.765 --> 09:16.666
Sorry. I hope I wasn't
hanging out there.

09:16.700 --> 09:18.734
Come on in.
Come on in.

09:20.203 --> 09:22.971
George's shoes are really
hard to make a getaway in.

09:23.006 --> 09:25.607
I think they're the Italian
ones OJ Simpson wore.

09:25.641 --> 09:28.109
Did you notice last night
how hairless George's legs are?

09:28.144 --> 09:29.544
I did notice.

09:29.579 --> 09:32.113
Do you think it's because his
pants have rubbed everything off

09:32.147 --> 09:35.148
over the last 60 years or did his
legs go bald because he's so old?

09:35.183 --> 09:37.750
I don't know.
It is mystifying.

09:37.784 --> 09:39.918
I think--
Oh my God, Ray, look.

09:41.686 --> 09:44.721
That arab terrorist
has your mole.

09:44.755 --> 09:47.623
That's me, Ray.
Here.

09:47.658 --> 09:49.525
Buy a copy.
We've got to get off the streets.

09:49.559 --> 09:52.595
- I'm a wanted man.
- I would have never drawn you like that.

09:53.930 --> 09:55.864
What is our city coming to?

09:55.898 --> 09:58.900
- Thank you, sir.
- There's killers everywhere.

10:04.238 --> 10:06.206
They made my nose way too big.

10:06.240 --> 10:08.575
This thing is a real
shylockian fish hook.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.376
Do you think it's
anti-semitic on purpose?

10:10.410 --> 10:12.711
I don't think so.
I think the cops will probably spin it

10:12.745 --> 10:15.047
as a Jew-on-Jew murder
to avoid a race riot.

10:15.081 --> 10:17.615
- Remember Crown Heights?
- Yeah, you're right.

10:17.650 --> 10:20.084
I wonder what Spencer's
nose will look like.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.119
Right now
it's just a little nub

10:22.154 --> 10:24.921
with these two little breathing holes.
Little guy.

10:24.956 --> 10:27.290
Yeah, my nose
was nice and small.

10:27.324 --> 10:30.359
Then it exploded.
Puberty hit me there at least two years

10:30.394 --> 10:32.394
before it hit my penis.
I was all out of proportion.

10:32.429 --> 10:36.332
Can we have one conversation
that doesn't involve your peen.

10:36.366 --> 10:39.068
It won't be easy,
but I can try.

10:39.103 --> 10:40.903
<i>I've got to get</i>
<i>the bastards who did this.</i>

10:40.938 --> 10:43.773
It has to be my client.
I never should have taken a case over the phone.

10:43.807 --> 10:47.010
- Do you know where he lives?
- No, but I do have his cell phone number.

10:47.044 --> 10:49.212
We need someone who can get
us an address off of that.

10:49.246 --> 10:51.715
Now I thi--
Shit, we've been made.

10:52.850 --> 10:54.884
How's staring camp going?

10:54.952 --> 10:57.354
<i>What's the matter,</i>
<i>you don't like my pajamas?</i>

10:57.388 --> 11:00.557
I don't like your
corporate slave outfit.

11:00.591 --> 11:02.992
<i>It's so good</i>
<i>to see you, Howard.</i>

11:03.026 --> 11:05.828
Yeah, I've been expecting you.
Get away from the window.

11:05.862 --> 11:08.197
I've been reading the papers.

11:08.231 --> 11:10.932
- Got everything prepared.
- What?

11:10.967 --> 11:14.769
I only had two hours, but I
think I've got you covered.

11:14.803 --> 11:18.237
All right, stolen Amex.
This is good for 48 hours.

11:18.272 --> 11:22.207
Passport.
And pilot disguise.

11:22.241 --> 11:25.108
Oh, and I'm throwing in
a free lock pick.

11:25.142 --> 11:26.774
I've always wanted
to wear one of these.

11:26.808 --> 11:29.808
I like the shiny brim.
I think my eyes are drawn to it.

11:29.843 --> 11:33.144
That's for Jonathan.
Where's George?

11:33.179 --> 11:35.279
He never fools around
on an operation.

11:35.314 --> 11:36.847
He's diverting
the police at the moment.

11:36.882 --> 11:39.850
Jaime Montero?
Why am I Mexican?

11:39.884 --> 11:42.018
You have Mexican pigmentation.

11:42.053 --> 11:45.421
You made him Mexican in this country?
They'll be all over him.

11:45.456 --> 11:48.290
I made him a Mexican
airline pilot.

11:48.325 --> 11:50.925
The two things
cancel each other out.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.427
You know, I don't think
I like your attitude.

11:53.462 --> 11:54.828
I don't think
I like your attitude.

11:54.863 --> 11:57.564
- Oh well, tell it to your beard.
- Whoa, guys.

11:57.599 --> 12:02.035
Howard, I appreciate all this
but I'm not leaving the U.S.

12:02.069 --> 12:04.303
I want to find the murderer
and prove my innocence.

12:04.337 --> 12:06.238
All I have
is his cell phone number.

12:06.272 --> 12:08.473
I need a name and an address.

12:08.507 --> 12:11.343
I'm gonna have to hack
into the Telecom.

12:11.377 --> 12:13.378
It's not gonna be easy.

12:13.413 --> 12:15.347
Not easy means not cheap.

12:15.382 --> 12:18.784
I assume George is paying
for all of this?

12:20.954 --> 12:23.990
- Yeah.
- All right, I'll run the number.

12:24.024 --> 12:26.225
Throw in another one
of these pilot outfits.

12:26.259 --> 12:28.494
I could have a fat pilot
outfit in 20 minutes.

12:28.528 --> 12:30.563
No, I need one.
This isn't for you.

12:30.597 --> 12:32.998
I'm glad you're not
running, Jonathan.

12:33.033 --> 12:37.069
I was convicted of exposing
myself on the d train.

12:37.103 --> 12:39.404
I've never been able
to clear my name.

12:39.439 --> 12:42.441
These people
with cell phone cameras.

12:43.643 --> 12:46.411
You have the chance
I never got.

13:03.096 --> 13:05.463
George, perfect timing.
I was just coming to see you.

13:05.498 --> 13:08.732
All right.
Just try to keep a low profile.

13:08.767 --> 13:10.800
What?
Why?

13:10.835 --> 13:12.569
There might be
people following me.

13:12.603 --> 13:15.471
No no, don't be so obvious.

13:15.505 --> 13:17.372
You know, I'm not one
to judge, George,

13:17.406 --> 13:19.774
but you reek of cannabis.

13:19.808 --> 13:22.443
I just had one medicinal hit.

13:22.478 --> 13:24.312
My nerves are shot.

13:24.346 --> 13:27.014
Try to be a little judicious about
this kind of thing with Emily.

13:27.048 --> 13:30.616
She's still new to sobriety.
She's not entirely stable.

13:30.651 --> 13:32.885
I know, I know.
I--

13:32.919 --> 13:36.388
Trust me, I have every intention
of hiding my smoking from her.

13:36.423 --> 13:38.491
And I don't usually indulge
in the morning.

13:38.525 --> 13:40.660
It's just that I've been
dealing with the police.

13:40.694 --> 13:42.262
Why?
What's happening?

13:42.296 --> 13:44.866
Are you selling marijuana?

13:44.901 --> 13:46.634
No no.

13:46.668 --> 13:48.369
A friend of mine is in trouble.

13:48.403 --> 13:50.704
He-- It's a bit
complicated.

13:50.739 --> 13:52.706
- It's best you stay out of it.
- Okay.

13:52.741 --> 13:55.542
But listen, I came to see
if you had an answer.

13:55.577 --> 13:58.946
<i>Do I have your permission</i>
<i>to marry Emily?</i>

14:02.918 --> 14:04.652
Bernard.

14:04.686 --> 14:06.554
I'm gonna borrow your bicycle.

14:06.588 --> 14:08.789
Wait.
George.

14:08.824 --> 14:11.959
- Yes or no?
- Can I get an extension?

14:11.993 --> 14:15.027
Not even wearing a helmet.

14:16.194 --> 14:17.659
The house over there.

14:17.693 --> 14:20.161
Was the bag really necessary?

14:20.196 --> 14:22.897
What? It makes my
outfit more authentic.

14:22.931 --> 14:24.799
Plus I need a good
overnight bag.

14:27.336 --> 14:30.004
- Shit, it's my parents.
- <i>Jonathan?</i>

14:30.038 --> 14:31.738
Mom, now is not a good time.

14:31.773 --> 14:34.507
- I got a--
- <i>Two homicide detectives are here.</i>

14:34.541 --> 14:37.508
They said you're wanted
for murder of a nice jockey.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.577
A Jewish jockey.
What were you thinking?

14:39.611 --> 14:41.811
<i>Did you murder him</i>
<i>because I'm sterile?</i>

14:41.846 --> 14:44.113
- Tell your parents I said hi.
- Listen, I'm innocent.

14:44.147 --> 14:47.015
I swear. Tell the detectives
I'm gonna clear my name.

14:47.049 --> 14:50.350
He says he's innocent.
He went to Princeton. He wouldn't lie.

14:50.385 --> 14:53.552
Yeah, the tuition there
was very expensive.

14:54.954 --> 14:57.288
I can't believe my parents
got dragged into this.

14:57.322 --> 15:00.457
They're hysterical.
I'm gonna make this guy pay.

15:07.629 --> 15:09.831
Shh shh shh.

15:18.540 --> 15:20.174
Check out that babe.

15:20.208 --> 15:21.776
Would you look at
the stems on her?

15:21.810 --> 15:24.547
That's the woman I was hired to tail.
She must be involved.

15:24.582 --> 15:27.351
- We're going in.
- Good.

15:37.162 --> 15:39.229
Who are you?
Why did you frame me?

15:39.264 --> 15:42.565
What? Who are you?
What are you pilots doing in my house?

15:42.599 --> 15:44.367
You know damn well who I am.

15:44.401 --> 15:47.936
- Don't play me for a fool or an idiot.
- Yeah, that's my job.

15:47.971 --> 15:50.238
Get out. I've never seen
you before in my life.

15:50.273 --> 15:53.174
Then call the cops. They're looking for me.
Might even get you a reward.

15:53.208 --> 15:55.342
Phone.

16:00.047 --> 16:02.615
You don't want the cops anywhere
near this place, do you?

16:02.649 --> 16:04.984
So quit the charade
and tell me,

16:05.018 --> 16:07.819
why did you do it?

16:11.557 --> 16:14.291
I didn't do it.
I swear.

16:15.393 --> 16:17.861
It-- It was
my boyfriend Sid.

16:17.895 --> 16:20.964
He found out Schwartz and I
were having an affair.

16:20.998 --> 16:23.399
That's why you were meeting
Schwartz at the hotel?

16:23.433 --> 16:25.468
Yes. Sid shot him
in cold blood.

16:25.502 --> 16:29.004
Told me he'd do the same to me
if I didn't keep my mouth shut.

16:29.038 --> 16:31.639
I'm a prisoner in my own home.

16:31.674 --> 16:34.442
Well, Sid's mother's house.

16:34.476 --> 16:36.410
Where is Sid now?
Tell me

16:36.444 --> 16:38.512
and you won't be
a prisoner anymore.

16:38.546 --> 16:40.213
He's at the prospect park
carousel.

16:40.247 --> 16:41.848
He works there.

16:41.882 --> 16:44.450
It's where all
the ex-jockeys end up.

16:47.253 --> 16:49.354
An ex-jockey-
on-jockey murder.

16:49.388 --> 16:52.023
You won't regret this.

16:52.057 --> 16:54.759
I'm gonna clear my name
and set you free.

16:58.363 --> 17:00.297
You're a little tall
for my taste,

17:00.331 --> 17:02.265
but when this is all over,

17:02.299 --> 17:05.800
you can leave your slippers
under my bed anytime.

17:05.836 --> 17:09.605
How about two
pairs of slippers?

17:18.079 --> 17:20.681
- Hola.
- George, it's Jonathan.

17:20.715 --> 17:23.384
Oh, Jonathan wait a second.

17:23.417 --> 17:26.252
- How do I know it's really you?
- Can't you tell from my voice?

17:26.287 --> 17:29.122
<i>Maybe.</i> <i>I mean, you do
sound</i> <i>kind of nasal.</i>

17:29.156 --> 17:30.923
I know, I know.

17:30.958 --> 17:33.526
Tell me something
that only you and I know.

17:33.560 --> 17:36.294
Last night you and Ray snuggled

17:36.328 --> 17:38.362
and didn't include me.

17:38.397 --> 17:39.863
What does that have
to do with anything?

17:39.897 --> 17:42.232
<i>I believe it's you.</i>
<i>So what's your 10-20?</i>

17:42.266 --> 17:45.301
Our location? We're heading to
the prospect park carousel.

17:45.336 --> 17:48.238
All right, I will tango
and foxtrot with you there.

17:48.272 --> 17:51.240
But you should probably know

17:51.274 --> 17:53.442
I think I'm being followed.

17:53.476 --> 17:56.143
- <i>Really?</i>
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

17:56.177 --> 17:59.479
By several agents.

17:59.547 --> 18:01.846
Possibly from...

18:01.881 --> 18:04.115
<i>Multiple branches</i>
<i>of the government.</i>

18:04.149 --> 18:06.850
<i>George, are you stoned?</i>

18:06.885 --> 18:09.752
Uh, no, not so much anymore.

18:09.787 --> 18:11.687
It's kind of wearing off.

18:11.722 --> 18:14.091
Wait a second.
We shouldn't be--

18:14.125 --> 18:16.930
<i>We should stay off the phone.</i>
<i>Hang up, hang up.</i>

18:16.964 --> 18:19.965
Uh, bye-bye, mamacita.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.267
Talk to you manana.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.436
What am I--

18:29.974 --> 18:32.375
Man down.
George is stoned.

18:33.678 --> 18:36.512
It's always the weak
who fall first in battle.

18:40.383 --> 18:43.352
Last ride of the day.
Last ride.

18:43.386 --> 18:46.288
That guy came to my reading.
Signed his book and everything.

18:46.322 --> 18:48.490
Did you personalize it?
A lot of times that's what the fans want.

18:48.525 --> 18:49.891
If you don't do that,
they get upset.

18:49.925 --> 18:52.359
I don't think that's why
he framed me for murder.

18:52.394 --> 18:55.162
Hey, Ray, Jonathan.

18:55.196 --> 18:57.364
Hey hi, guys.

18:57.398 --> 18:59.766
- Shh.
- No, it's okay.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.233
I think I lost them.

19:01.268 --> 19:03.569
- Where'd you get that great bike?
- From Bernard.

19:03.603 --> 19:05.471
Why are you guys in the Navy?

19:05.505 --> 19:07.072
We're pilots for Aero Mexico.

19:07.106 --> 19:08.706
We picked up disguises
from Howard.

19:08.741 --> 19:10.508
You went there without me?
Oh, come on.

19:10.542 --> 19:12.276
You know how much
I love going to Howard's.

19:12.310 --> 19:14.679
I'm sorry, George.
You can come with us next time.

19:14.713 --> 19:17.281
- You want me to fill you in?
- No no, I'll catch on.

19:17.316 --> 19:19.483
I'm very intuitive.

19:19.518 --> 19:21.986
God, it's a beautiful
Ferris wheel.

19:22.020 --> 19:24.188
It's a carousel, George.

19:24.222 --> 19:26.490
Well, it's...

19:27.558 --> 19:29.258
Oh yeah.

19:47.742 --> 19:50.477
- That was for Schwartz.
- Who's Schwartz?

19:50.511 --> 19:52.778
- Hey, come on.
- I'll pick it up as we go.

19:52.812 --> 19:54.513
You're coming downtown with us.

19:54.547 --> 19:57.882
Well, uptown actually, and
to the west-- To the cops.

19:57.916 --> 19:59.850
You can take me in, Dick,
but you got nothing on me.

19:59.885 --> 20:01.952
Oh, I got plenty.
The blonde gave us the goods.

20:01.987 --> 20:03.353
- What blonde?
- George, please.

20:03.388 --> 20:05.456
- Okay.
- Kitty ratted me out?

20:05.490 --> 20:08.726
Yeah, she told us everything.
I only have one question:

20:08.760 --> 20:10.194
Why me?

20:10.228 --> 20:13.096
It was that article about you
and your book in "the post."

20:13.131 --> 20:15.332
It was clear you were
somebody who could be duped.

20:15.366 --> 20:18.267
Why were his pants around his
ankles in the hotel room, hmm?

20:18.301 --> 20:19.968
Yeah, Ray's very curious
about that.

20:20.002 --> 20:22.971
We were painting the picture that
you and Schwartz were lovers,

20:23.005 --> 20:25.506
had a quarrel.
Figured that would stick.

20:25.541 --> 20:27.974
You got $3 bill
written all over you.

20:28.009 --> 20:29.809
- Hey.
- Wait a second.

20:29.843 --> 20:32.311
- What do you mean we?
- It was kitty's idea--

20:32.346 --> 20:35.447
The pants at the ankles, everything.
She wanted Schwartz dead.

20:35.482 --> 20:37.716
But I thought that you killed
Schwartz out of green-eyed jealousy.

20:37.750 --> 20:40.985
What are you talking about?
Schwartz made her the beneficiary

20:41.019 --> 20:42.986
of his will
and his life insurance.

20:43.021 --> 20:45.722
She played him.
That's why we knocked him off.

20:45.756 --> 20:47.657
And she was gonna split
the money with you?

20:47.691 --> 20:50.426
Yeah. We were gonna
leave town together,

20:50.460 --> 20:54.228
start a new life
away from the ponies.

20:54.263 --> 20:57.197
Oh, this is a terrible story.

20:58.733 --> 21:01.468
Gumball, you came for me.

21:01.502 --> 21:03.603
I had a dream about a
gumball machine last night.

21:03.637 --> 21:06.305
Hello, Sid.

21:06.339 --> 21:08.807
Oh my God!
Gumball shot him!

21:08.841 --> 21:11.376
Whoa whoa whoa!
What are you doing?

21:11.411 --> 21:13.345
You shouldn't throw a gun.
They're like scissors.

21:13.379 --> 21:16.581
Why not? I'm getting your prints on
the gun you just killed Sid with.

21:18.916 --> 21:21.084
Sorry, no bullets left.

21:22.486 --> 21:24.754
But this one is loaded.

21:24.788 --> 21:28.323
And this is the gun
Sid used to kill you

21:28.358 --> 21:30.090
and your friends during
your little shootout.

21:30.125 --> 21:32.692
Please don't.
Look, I just became a new dad

21:32.726 --> 21:35.161
to a beautiful boy named Spencer.
His mothers are divorced lesbians

21:35.195 --> 21:37.362
and I love him very much.
Please don't do this.

21:37.397 --> 21:40.298
Stop crying.
This isn't a book club.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.100
You plugged me.

21:43.602 --> 21:46.303
Go!

21:49.106 --> 21:50.707
I loved you.

21:52.376 --> 21:54.076
Go!

21:56.012 --> 21:58.947
- <i>Down! Get down!</i>
- <i>I'm too young</i> <i>to be shot.</i>

21:58.982 --> 22:01.916
Other way! Other way! Other way! No no no!

22:01.951 --> 22:03.851
I'm never going on
a Ferris wheel again.

22:03.886 --> 22:05.920
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

22:05.954 --> 22:07.421
Drop your weapon!

22:10.424 --> 22:12.592
Ow.

22:12.626 --> 22:16.096
Look look look.
See, I knew I was being followed.

22:16.130 --> 22:18.832
Hi, remember me?

22:18.866 --> 22:21.300
I'm not paranoid.

22:25.138 --> 22:27.539
You did a great job, Jonathan.

22:27.573 --> 22:29.941
- Excellent detective work.
- Thank you, officer Drake.

22:29.975 --> 22:31.742
Coming from you,
that means a lot.

22:31.777 --> 22:34.711
That's why the boys
and I got you these

22:34.746 --> 22:37.547
as a token of our
appreciation. Look.

22:37.582 --> 22:39.816
Is this like making us
honorary deputies?

22:39.850 --> 22:41.951
- No, they're just baseball caps.
- I see.

22:41.985 --> 22:43.919
- Yeah, so...
- Well, thank you.

22:43.953 --> 22:46.855
And how are you doing,
officer Drake?

22:46.889 --> 22:48.490
- You know, with your issue?
- Yeah.

22:48.524 --> 22:50.726
Well, I did start to...

22:50.760 --> 22:53.528
Take my wife's
birth control pills.

22:53.563 --> 22:56.097
But then, you know, I stopped

22:56.132 --> 22:58.834
and I got some therapy
and now I'm doing much better.

22:58.868 --> 23:00.769
So thank you for asking.

23:00.803 --> 23:02.437
Anytime.

23:02.472 --> 23:04.406
Okay.

23:10.247 --> 23:13.916
- All cleared up?
- Guys, I'm really sorry I put your lives in danger.

23:13.951 --> 23:16.184
You know, I like these
little brushes with death.

23:16.218 --> 23:18.418
- Makes everything new again.
- I don't.

23:18.452 --> 23:21.020
I can't afford to die, Jonathan.
I don't have health insurance.

23:21.054 --> 23:24.022
- I'm so sorry, Ray.
- Look, I don't like to be the voice of reason,

23:24.057 --> 23:25.724
but now that I'm a dad
I guess it suits me.

23:25.758 --> 23:28.126
You've got to stop being a detective.
It's too dangerous.

23:28.160 --> 23:30.494
- I keep getting hurt.
- I don't know.

23:30.529 --> 23:32.429
The police gave us these hats.

23:32.464 --> 23:34.364
Must be doing something right.

23:34.399 --> 23:36.533
Oh, Jonathan.

23:36.567 --> 23:38.534
I like this hat.

23:38.569 --> 23:40.670
Yeah, now I don't feel
so left out.

23:40.704 --> 23:43.538
Besides, Ray,
can't retire just yet.

23:43.572 --> 23:46.740
Still have to find out
who my real dad is.

23:46.775 --> 23:49.710
And you will, Jonathan.
You will.

23:49.745 --> 23:51.279
Shall we?

23:52.447 --> 23:54.182
You know, I really do
like that bag.

23:54.216 --> 23:57.318
Howard sells them, right?
Does it have a false bottom?

23:57.352 --> 23:59.520
I have a false bottom.

23:59.554 --> 24:03.122
Well, you know, sometimes.
I'm not wearing one now.

24:03.156 --> 24:05.156
George, what are you
talking about?

24:05.190 --> 24:07.291
Well, have you ever seen
these little undies

24:07.325 --> 24:09.059
that have pads on each cheek?

24:09.093 --> 24:10.360
Yeah, they make those for men?

24:10.394 --> 24:12.662
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
