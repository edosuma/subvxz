00:04.172 --> 00:06.975
Quill, the Helmet told me
what I have to do.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.089
You must never let
the Cocoon be opened, ever!

00:10.114 --> 00:11.617
I'm trusting you on this.

00:11.642 --> 00:13.629
Wait. What are you gonna do?

00:13.654 --> 00:15.109
What's necessary.

00:18.161 --> 00:19.712
Gamora!

00:21.000 --> 00:27.074

00:50.172 --> 00:53.321
I... am Groot.

00:53.692 --> 00:58.114
Gamora made the ultimate sacrifice
to protect the galaxy from the Believers.

00:58.139 --> 01:02.417
She was a fine warrior,
and I swear she shall be avenged.

01:05.102 --> 01:07.487
And I swear to tear down
the wall between our bunks

01:07.512 --> 01:11.830
so mine can get bigger,
just like Gammy made me promise.

01:11.983 --> 01:13.781
I do not recall such an oath.

01:13.896 --> 01:15.670
Hey! I'm grieving here!

01:18.871 --> 01:21.052
So much more room to sleep.

01:23.631 --> 01:25.759
As far as I'm concerned,
Gamora's still out there,

01:25.794 --> 01:27.626
and you're all wasting
a whole lot of time.

01:27.651 --> 01:29.528
Or did you forget about these?

01:31.409 --> 01:34.226
The Quantum Bands glowed when Gamora
and I were both touching them.

01:34.262 --> 01:36.996
They're glowing now because
she's trying to contact me.

01:37.032 --> 01:40.322
Yeah, and that krutackin' thing
glowed when it vaporized her.

01:40.347 --> 01:42.182
Glowin' don't mean flarg, Quill.

01:42.207 --> 01:43.326
Gamora's...

01:44.254 --> 01:46.633
She's gone, okay?

01:50.592 --> 01:53.298
I am Groot.

01:54.032 --> 01:55.484
Ah, Groot.

01:55.594 --> 01:58.353
You always got just
the right thing to say.

01:58.609 --> 02:01.268
Fine. We disagree
on what happened to Gamora,

02:01.293 --> 02:03.492
but I promised her I'd make sure
that Cocoon would never open,

02:03.517 --> 02:05.225
and I'm gonna keep that promise

02:05.250 --> 02:07.403
right now.

02:16.270 --> 02:18.111
I am Groot.

02:18.136 --> 02:20.589
Don't be dense.
Or, you know, denser.

02:20.614 --> 02:23.002
This cryo-volcano's been
dormant for centuries.

02:23.027 --> 02:25.999
Now let's get back to the ship
before my tail freezes off.

02:26.024 --> 02:27.244
Hold up, Rocket.

02:27.269 --> 02:29.257
There's one more thing we gotta do:

02:29.282 --> 02:32.039
Play Gamora's favorite song
one last time.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.533
But you said she was still alive.

02:34.558 --> 02:36.323
That's not the point, Drax.
Hit it!

02:37.052 --> 02:40.219
♪<i> 'Cause it took so long</i>
<i>to bake it</i> ♪

02:40.678 --> 02:47.173
♪<i> And I'll never have</i>
<i>that recipe again</i> ♪

02:47.466 --> 02:49.612
<i>♪ Again ♪</i>

02:49.637 --> 02:52.656
You idiot! Gamora hated
all your krutackin' songs!

02:52.681 --> 02:55.548
And she loved hating this one the most.

02:58.887 --> 03:01.556
Oh, man! Not during
my air drum solo!

03:04.450 --> 03:07.804
The terrible music Quill enjoys
has reactivated the volcano.

03:07.829 --> 03:09.580
Everyone, return to the ship!

03:11.775 --> 03:14.761
Guys, it's no big deal. I'll just
use the tractor beam to...

03:18.824 --> 03:20.577
Okay, the controls are frozen up.

03:21.831 --> 03:24.582
Ugh! Can't we even
get a memorial right?

03:26.471 --> 03:29.064
Let's focus on escaping
before the next memorial

03:29.089 --> 03:30.493
is ours!

03:45.435 --> 03:49.471
Let's jet to the ship before
that cryo-volcano freezes us solid.

03:53.377 --> 03:54.320
Huh?

03:56.396 --> 03:57.397
Rocket!

03:58.396 --> 03:59.631
Hang on!

04:00.056 --> 04:00.771
Oh!

04:03.260 --> 04:04.669
I am Groot!

04:04.694 --> 04:07.325
Thanks, bud.
Now, get us up to the ship.

04:11.477 --> 04:15.435
I am Groot!

04:23.765 --> 04:25.285
Any bright ideas, Quill?

04:25.310 --> 04:28.335
- And don't say another krutackin' song!
- Oh, really?

04:28.360 --> 04:31.523
'Cause "Stairway to Heaven" is
about to save your furry butt.

04:51.285 --> 04:52.678
Ugh! Finally.

04:52.703 --> 04:54.691
One more bar of this
so-called music,

04:54.716 --> 04:56.975
and I'd fly straight
into that volcano myself.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.555
Ah, it's kind of fitting, I guess.

04:58.586 --> 05:01.988
- Gamora loves narrow escapes.
- She hated narrow escapes.

05:02.013 --> 05:04.940
- She...
- Not "hated," Rocket. "Hates."

05:04.965 --> 05:06.684
She's still out there.

05:20.339 --> 05:21.337
Okay.

05:21.362 --> 05:24.871
I may not be able to hold a memorial
right, or escape an ice volcano right,

05:24.896 --> 05:28.011
but no one is ever gonna
touch that Cocoon, Gamora.

05:35.127 --> 05:37.343
And this drum solo's for you.

05:39.749 --> 05:40.929
Oh!

05:42.321 --> 05:44.778
Quill! What are you doing here?

05:44.803 --> 05:46.345
What happened to Gamora?

05:46.370 --> 05:50.029
Nebula, I...
Wait. Gamora's alive?

05:50.170 --> 05:52.464
Gamora's alive! Whoo!

05:52.489 --> 05:54.730
In your pointy little muzzle, Rocket!

05:57.264 --> 06:00.383
Oh, I guess that means the
High Evolutionary's alive too.

06:02.071 --> 06:04.477
His minions have been
hunting us since we arrived.

06:04.502 --> 06:06.800
I suggest you run.

06:17.358 --> 06:19.744
Ah, Gammy, I'm gonna miss ya,

06:19.769 --> 06:23.133
but this extra elbow room
will sure help soften the blow.

06:32.881 --> 06:35.261
- Rocket, how am I back here?
- Hmm?

06:35.286 --> 06:37.550
And why is there a hole in my wall?

06:39.589 --> 06:41.334
Your species has ghosts?

06:42.276 --> 06:44.953
It was Quill's idea! Haunt him!

06:51.514 --> 06:55.096
Okay, you got any bright ideas on
how to get away from these things?

06:55.121 --> 06:57.447
As my father Thanos used to say:

06:57.472 --> 06:59.986
"You don't have to be faster
than the Morag Raptor,

07:00.011 --> 07:03.447
just faster than the slowest
person it's chasing."

07:06.810 --> 07:09.636
Oh, that's low, Nebula, even for you!

07:11.014 --> 07:13.672
Uhh... Not the face!

07:14.167 --> 07:15.496
Not the face!

07:17.764 --> 07:20.937
- Trim your nails! Aah!
- I am Groot!

07:22.378 --> 07:24.577
Rocket, why are you attacking Quill?

07:24.602 --> 07:28.049
That ain't Quill.
It's Gamora's ghost!

07:28.074 --> 07:31.760
Okay, first of all, Gamora's alive.
Nebula just told me.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.269
It is as I feared, Groot.

07:33.294 --> 07:35.343
They have both gone insane with grief.

07:35.368 --> 07:37.259
I am Groot.

07:37.273 --> 07:38.919
Who you calling insane?

07:38.944 --> 07:41.699
And why are you agreeing with him?

07:41.724 --> 07:44.358
I believe you, Rocket.
I was there.

07:44.383 --> 07:46.872
- Where?
- Somewhere else.

07:46.897 --> 07:49.946
Me and Nebula were running from the
High Evolutionary's hench-freaks when,

07:49.971 --> 07:52.237
pe-zah, I was back here again.

07:52.262 --> 07:57.055
Uh-huh. So how did you "pe-zah"
there in the first place, huh?

07:57.080 --> 07:59.888
Well, let's see. I mean, I was
finishing my drum solo, so...

08:02.248 --> 08:03.218
Bah!

08:04.730 --> 08:05.853
Huh?

08:05.878 --> 08:08.188
Gamora, you were not vaporized.

08:08.213 --> 08:13.494
I... I am Groot!

08:13.710 --> 08:15.590
It's good to see you all.

08:15.615 --> 08:18.516
I never thought I'd ask this,
but where's Quill?

08:18.717 --> 08:21.157
Oh-ho-ho! Ah, this is funny.

08:21.182 --> 08:23.723
Whenever Quill hits those
Quantum Bands together,

08:23.748 --> 08:25.755
you and him switch places!

08:29.274 --> 08:30.327
Too soon?

08:30.358 --> 08:33.263
Which means Quill
is inside the Cocoon now?

08:33.438 --> 08:34.855
- I am Groot?
- Say what now?

08:34.880 --> 08:36.909
We thought its energy vaporized people.

08:36.934 --> 08:40.855
It didn't. It teleported us
to a realm within the cocoon.

08:40.880 --> 08:43.046
Oh. Hmm.

08:43.073 --> 08:45.151
That realm, uh...

08:45.183 --> 08:48.938
It wouldn't be getting colder
by any chance, would it? Huh?

08:48.963 --> 08:50.323
Yes. Why?

08:50.348 --> 08:53.935
We, uh, threw the Cocoon
into a cryo-volcano.

08:53.960 --> 08:56.261
You what?

09:03.242 --> 09:06.360
What could this infernal place
possibly throw at us next?

09:06.396 --> 09:08.762
Not "infernal," "glacial."

09:08.787 --> 09:11.810
We threw the Cocoon into an ice volcano.
It's freezing solid!

09:15.553 --> 09:18.603
Didn't you hear me? This whole
place is freezing over!

09:18.628 --> 09:20.820
We gotta get out of here ASAP!

09:20.845 --> 09:23.841
Don't tell me you're afraid
of a little ice, human?

09:23.947 --> 09:27.394
Nah. It's the big ice
I'm scared of.

09:33.555 --> 09:36.285
Never thought I'd miss
getting punched in the face!

09:46.882 --> 09:49.454
Whoa! Who knew these bands
could do that?

09:49.479 --> 09:52.025
Give me those Quantum Bands!
Now!

09:52.050 --> 09:55.188
Well, when you put it...
Oh, look over there!

10:00.708 --> 10:03.387
You must be famished. Eat. Oh!

10:03.569 --> 10:05.657
Not the face!

10:15.003 --> 10:16.469
What is wrong with you?

10:16.494 --> 10:18.754
The phrase you're looking for
is "thank you."

10:18.779 --> 10:22.412
- I didn't ask you to save me.
- But I did.

10:22.437 --> 10:25.493
We may be enemies,
but you'll always be my sister.

10:26.517 --> 10:30.877
Maybe our feud is less
than useful right now.

10:31.027 --> 10:34.535
We'll have a better chance of surviving
this place if we work together.

10:36.620 --> 10:39.320
It started to rain
giant icicles, like...

10:39.356 --> 10:42.084
Like as big as Groot. Mmm!

10:42.109 --> 10:43.933
I am Groot.

10:43.968 --> 10:46.414
That's when I realized
we must have accidentally

10:46.439 --> 10:49.508
frozen the whole realm when we
tossed that Cocoon in the volcano.

10:49.532 --> 10:51.557
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What do you mean "we"?

10:51.855 --> 10:55.232
Fine. I tossed it
into the volcano.

10:55.257 --> 10:58.373
We've still gotta get it out
before Gamora freezes in there.

10:59.931 --> 11:03.497
Still not feeling the "we" here.

11:14.262 --> 11:17.324
I think this storm
is actually getting worse.

11:19.689 --> 11:22.085
At least the Hybrids can't spot us.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.330
Let's hope it stays that way.

11:29.918 --> 11:33.808
I want the High Evolutionary's ship
as far away as possible from...

11:35.092 --> 11:37.223
Nebula, the ship...

11:37.248 --> 11:39.174
It doesn't have any ice on it.

11:40.164 --> 11:42.750
- It's warm.
- And here I didn't think

11:42.786 --> 11:45.679
I could hate that
miserable monster more.

11:45.780 --> 11:48.056
We have to get to whatever's
heating that ship.

11:48.091 --> 11:50.375
We might be able to modify it
to reheat the realm,

11:50.410 --> 11:52.451
buy the Guardians time to save us.

11:52.487 --> 11:55.630
You save the realm, I'll thaw my hands.

11:55.665 --> 11:58.483
Assuming you have any idea
how to get up there.

12:04.516 --> 12:07.461
Never doubt a
daughter of Thanos.

12:12.316 --> 12:13.827
Race you inside.

12:13.852 --> 12:15.651
Oh-ho, it's on, sister!

12:15.676 --> 12:18.884
Having trouble keeping up?
Need me to slow down for you?

12:18.909 --> 12:20.988
Ha! Never did, never will.

12:21.814 --> 12:23.829
Looks like I win, sister.

12:23.854 --> 12:25.489
That was just the first round.

12:25.514 --> 12:27.363
The real challenge lies ahead.

12:27.396 --> 12:31.229
Silence!
Genetically questionable blue oaf!

12:31.417 --> 12:33.783
If you continue to distract me, Yondu,

12:33.808 --> 12:37.670
I will have you reduced to a
pleasantly variegated smear.

12:37.765 --> 12:40.113
Now let me finish
recharging the heating core,

12:40.138 --> 12:44.303
and then we can see what your paltry
genetic makeup has to offer me.

12:47.946 --> 12:51.083
If we can take the power core
and turn it on full blast,

12:51.115 --> 12:55.276
the energy differential should be enough
to drain that pompous psychopath.

12:55.301 --> 12:58.675
Then we funnel the heat out all at
once and hopefully thaw the realm.

12:58.700 --> 13:01.120
That's a temporary solution
at best, if your Guardians

13:01.145 --> 13:03.618
can't retrieve the Cocoon
from the cryo-volcano.

13:03.643 --> 13:07.396
Relax. Even Quill can handle
picking up an unmoving object.

13:09.732 --> 13:12.171
Easy. Easy!

13:12.905 --> 13:13.837
Okay. Wait. I see it.

13:13.862 --> 13:17.286
Just give me a little more slack.
Whoa! Aah! Whoa!

13:17.505 --> 13:19.171
Whoa! Okay, too much slack!

13:19.678 --> 13:20.635
Whoa!

13:22.189 --> 13:24.835
Rocket, don't lower the winch yet!

13:30.570 --> 13:31.787
Quill!

13:33.363 --> 13:36.806
Rocket! Groot! I'm down here!

13:36.841 --> 13:39.362
- I am Groot! I am Groot! 
- What?

13:39.888 --> 13:41.583
Oh, krutack.

13:42.401 --> 13:44.030
Sorry, Gammy.

13:45.774 --> 13:46.999
Ohh...

13:47.354 --> 13:47.981
Oh!

13:48.990 --> 13:50.940
Quill, get us outta here!

13:50.965 --> 13:54.453
If you intruders wish
to share in my ship's heat,

13:54.478 --> 13:57.327
I have a specimen cage ready for you.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.780
I meant teleport us, you idiot!

14:03.905 --> 14:05.843
Hybrids, detain them!

14:07.886 --> 14:09.439
I am Groot.

14:09.464 --> 14:11.479
I said I was sorry.

14:11.504 --> 14:14.309
Saying it again ain't gonna
thaw her out any faster.

14:14.337 --> 14:15.977
My comfort's not important.

14:16.002 --> 14:19.624
I have to retrieve the Cocoon
before everyone inside it freezes.

14:19.649 --> 14:23.115
Yeah, but you don't gotta be stupid.
Insulated force field.

14:23.140 --> 14:25.693
Two separate energy fields
with a vacuum between them.

14:25.724 --> 14:27.865
Keeps heat in and ice out.

14:27.890 --> 14:30.623
What do we do if Quill makes 
another surprise visit.

14:30.648 --> 14:32.881
You mean when he messes 
this whole thing up?

14:32.906 --> 14:36.258
Don't worry. Me and Groot
got it all worked out.

14:39.695 --> 14:43.947
Oh, man! I mean, would it kill the High
Evolutionary to mark his exits clearly?

14:43.972 --> 14:45.409
Huh?

14:46.505 --> 14:49.753
If you can't figure out
how to save us, I will!

14:51.583 --> 14:53.635
- Nebula? 
- Aw, krutack.

14:53.660 --> 14:56.328
Groot, we're gonna need
to modify the plan.

14:59.077 --> 15:00.248
Huh?

15:01.764 --> 15:02.829
Oh!

15:06.926 --> 15:11.534
Another stowaway. And this
one without a weapon.

15:11.559 --> 15:14.097
How very tragic.

15:24.907 --> 15:28.410
Insulated force field.
Thank you, Rocket.

15:31.214 --> 15:32.362
Stop her!

15:34.919 --> 15:37.527
Get off! You already escaped!

15:38.921 --> 15:41.555
You're too stupid to use the
bands to save your own skin,

15:41.580 --> 15:43.734
you don't deserve to wield their power!

15:48.060 --> 15:49.446
She's got a point, Quill.

15:49.471 --> 15:52.633
Yeah. She's also got a really
strong grip, so get her off me!

15:56.149 --> 15:57.144
Come on!

15:57.169 --> 15:58.698
Not the Quantum Bands!

16:05.304 --> 16:08.397
Whoa! Groot! Backup
Plan 9, and double it!

16:08.422 --> 16:10.402
- Go!
- I am Groot!

16:41.075 --> 16:43.107
What did my sister do now?

16:43.259 --> 16:44.510
I am Groot!

16:44.546 --> 16:45.728
Ugh! Let go!

16:45.753 --> 16:48.885
You can't want to stay here,
you miserable shrub!

16:51.749 --> 16:53.179
We don't got much time.

16:53.204 --> 16:56.362
Get down there, grab the Cocoon,
and don't ask questions!

16:56.387 --> 16:58.932
- And I will pilot the ship.
- What did I just say?

16:58.957 --> 17:02.112
I said "don't ask questions," not
"say the dumbest thing possible."

17:02.137 --> 17:04.411
You are the galaxy's worst pilot!

17:04.435 --> 17:06.306
I have been practicing.

17:06.330 --> 17:09.991
We're on autopilot.
You don't gotta do nothing.

17:10.016 --> 17:11.530
I do not have to do nothing,

17:11.555 --> 17:14.560
therefore I do have to do
something... I understand.

17:14.585 --> 17:15.848
Huh?

17:18.109 --> 17:20.045
Just a little lower.

17:30.645 --> 17:32.861
<i>I have the Cocoon. Pull me up.</i>

17:33.005 --> 17:35.091
I do not know what that flashing means.

17:35.116 --> 17:39.001
But Drax the Destroyer
will not be defeated by buttons.

17:43.695 --> 17:46.001
The forecast calls for a heat wave.

17:50.730 --> 17:52.500
Drax, the ship's icing up!

17:52.525 --> 17:54.377
You wanted to do something.
Do it!

17:54.402 --> 17:57.549
Fear not. Drax the
Destroyer will not do nothing.

17:57.574 --> 17:59.729
Yeah, th... Wait. What?

18:01.977 --> 18:06.185
Let me go! If we fall back into
that water, we'll both freeze.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.788
I am Groot. I am Groot.

18:09.505 --> 18:11.387
28, 27...

18:11.412 --> 18:14.415
I better get up to the cockpit.
Drax needs help.

18:14.440 --> 18:17.180
- No, he don't. 
- Yes, he does!

18:17.205 --> 18:19.886
Well, too bad! I need her more.

18:19.911 --> 18:21.886
See, I was almost too late
to do this...

18:21.911 --> 18:22.917
Rocket!

18:24.196 --> 18:27.206
And that could've thrown
the whole plan off.

18:33.771 --> 18:36.841
Rocket, what am I supposed to do now?

18:36.866 --> 18:39.016
You might wanna tie that
around your waist.

18:39.041 --> 18:41.413
Just sit tight until I say so.

18:41.535 --> 18:44.621
This isn't the type
of place I wanna sit at all!

18:44.646 --> 18:46.982
Yeah, we all gotta make sacrifices.

18:47.007 --> 18:49.395
Three, two, one...

18:49.420 --> 18:50.386
No! Wait!

18:50.421 --> 18:51.501
I am Groot!

18:52.221 --> 18:53.212
Huh?

18:59.005 --> 19:01.115
Whoo! Nice timing, Groot!

19:01.157 --> 19:02.930
Yeah, perfect plan, Rocket!

19:02.955 --> 19:07.357
It's just but one quick thing: Gamora and
Groot are trapped on the other side!

19:07.382 --> 19:10.747
Don't get your hairless hide in a whirl.
I ain't done yet.

19:10.772 --> 19:13.401
Now help out
and fire-blast her arms.

19:21.382 --> 19:24.321
Gently. These things are
super brittle right now.

19:30.417 --> 19:32.776
Groot, if you have a plan,
now's the time.

19:32.808 --> 19:35.049
I am Groot. I am Groot.

19:35.074 --> 19:36.319
I am Groot!

19:37.528 --> 19:38.459
No!

19:45.442 --> 19:47.374
No! No!

19:51.640 --> 19:52.978
All right, Groot!

19:53.003 --> 19:56.091
Can we time an escape,
or what? Ha!

20:01.450 --> 20:03.425
You didn't give up on me, Quill.

20:08.617 --> 20:12.767
The button defeated me! I could
not resist its enticing flash!

20:12.792 --> 20:16.733
It's all right, Drax. Set a course
for the nearest Nova Corps outpost.

20:16.758 --> 20:20.258
I promised I'd make sure that Cocoon never
opened, and I'm gonna do just that.

20:20.465 --> 20:24.347
Even if it means...
telling the truth.

20:29.140 --> 20:34.144
Now, we asked if you found anything else
in the Sarcophagus, and you said...

20:34.169 --> 20:36.866
No. I know.
But now I'm saying yes.

20:36.891 --> 20:40.751
See? This is why I have trouble
trusting you, Quill.

20:40.776 --> 20:42.423
We've gone over this before.

20:42.448 --> 20:44.803
You can keep this safe, correct?

20:44.828 --> 20:49.852
Nova Corps headquarters has the best
temporal stasis fields in the galaxy.

20:49.877 --> 20:53.636
Once we get it to Xandar,
this thing's never gonna open.

20:53.661 --> 20:57.665
You have my word, which is
actually worth something.

21:04.092 --> 21:07.442
Really? We're just handing
over the priceless artifact,

21:07.732 --> 21:09.945
not to mention giving up any bounty

21:09.970 --> 21:12.703
on the intergalactic criminals
still trapped inside that thing?

21:12.728 --> 21:15.381
If I were you, Rocket,
I'd worry less about units

21:15.406 --> 21:17.585
and more about sleeping arrangements.

21:18.827 --> 21:20.574
G-Gammy...

21:27.370 --> 21:30.204
Next time I'm leaving her
in the Cocoon.
