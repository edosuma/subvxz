<i>Hillside Police.</i>

00:53.619 --> 00:54.987
<i>Detective Malloy, please?</i>

00:56.587 --> 00:57.989
<i>I'd like to report a crime.</i>

01:03.495 --> 01:04.896
Mm-hmm.

01:06.432 --> 01:07.467
Can we talk?

01:10.803 --> 01:11.837
Sure.

01:12.438 --> 01:13.473
Come on in.

01:14.940 --> 01:15.842
Alone?

01:27.218 --> 01:28.420
Long night?

01:29.521 --> 01:30.587
Yeah.

01:30.589 --> 01:31.623
How 'bout some coffee?

01:34.059 --> 01:37.063
Do you have trouble remembering
things sometimes, Detective?

02:16.000 --> 02:17.602
I'll finish up
if you want to go.

02:17.903 --> 02:19.836
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, totally.

02:19.838 --> 02:20.873
I'll clock you out.

02:28.880 --> 02:31.080
Hey, so, Eric's mom's
out of town,

02:31.082 --> 02:32.949
and he's having people over.

02:32.951 --> 02:34.751
Who's all going?

02:34.753 --> 02:35.688
Everyone.

02:36.922 --> 02:37.990
You wanna ride together?

02:38.656 --> 02:39.892
I don't know.

02:40.191 --> 02:42.227
I'm not feeling
the whole kegger thing.

02:43.928 --> 02:45.797
- Are you okay, Joyce?
- Yeah.

02:46.064 --> 02:47.764
Well, text me later.
Maybe I'll go.

02:47.766 --> 02:48.667
Okay.

04:30.201 --> 04:31.836
Uh, why did I come in here?

04:32.336 --> 04:33.338
I can't help you.

04:33.972 --> 04:35.007
Oh, more soap.

04:36.107 --> 04:37.841
Hmm. Dare I ask?

04:37.843 --> 04:39.011
I'm washing the car.

04:39.377 --> 04:41.247
Why? What's the occasion?

04:41.713 --> 04:42.881
It's Saturday,

04:43.148 --> 04:44.951
and Saturday is the day
we get things done.

04:47.151 --> 04:49.653
Zelda, honey, will you go
help your dad wash the car?

04:49.655 --> 04:50.853
Do I have to?

04:50.855 --> 04:52.190
Well, it'd be nice if you did.

04:52.824 --> 04:54.093
Come on. You can play
with Marvin later.

04:59.263 --> 05:00.997
Mom said I should help you.

05:00.999 --> 05:03.602
Oh, great. Well,
grab a rag, and dig in.

05:11.742 --> 05:14.613
Yuck, Dad. When was the
last time you washed this?

05:22.453 --> 05:23.689
Oh, no!

05:24.222 --> 05:25.625
Got me! Oh!

05:25.924 --> 05:27.293
Gotcha! Gotcha! Gotcha!

05:27.925 --> 05:29.225
Get away from my sister!

05:29.227 --> 05:31.097
Oh, no! It's Super Dude!

05:31.463 --> 05:33.062
It's Super Dude!

05:33.064 --> 05:34.666
Can we get
a momentary cease-fire?

05:35.300 --> 05:36.636
Why? Do you want to get past?

05:37.436 --> 05:38.935
I don't know. What do you think?

05:38.937 --> 05:40.704
- Should we let Mommy pass?
- Yeah.

05:40.706 --> 05:41.937
- Okay.
- Yeah?

05:41.939 --> 05:43.273
Okay, well,
put the thing down.

05:43.275 --> 05:44.708
- You don't trust us?
- I trust them.

05:44.710 --> 05:45.845
Oh, ouch.

05:50.081 --> 05:52.117
- As for safe passage on the way back...
- Hey! Hey!

05:52.783 --> 05:53.685
Don't you dare.

05:54.086 --> 05:55.021
What do you think, Z?

05:55.720 --> 05:57.286
She never asked to get back.

05:57.288 --> 05:58.822
- She never asked to get back.
- I'm your mother!

05:58.824 --> 06:00.189
She never asked to get back.

06:00.191 --> 06:01.391
She never asked.

06:01.393 --> 06:02.928
That's right. She never asked.

06:03.227 --> 06:04.763
Did she? Whoa!

06:04.963 --> 06:06.730
She never asked to get back.

06:06.732 --> 06:08.333
Oh, get her! Get her!

06:09.934 --> 06:11.771
Well, that was a great lesson
to teach our kids,

06:12.002 --> 06:13.271
how to back out
of their word.

06:13.739 --> 06:15.471
I was just demonstrating
the importance

06:15.473 --> 06:17.208
of choosing your words
precisely.

06:18.442 --> 06:21.746
Besides, all's fair
in love and water fights.

06:22.146 --> 06:23.048
Mm.

06:23.982 --> 06:25.451
Did you forget why
you came in here, too?

06:25.850 --> 06:27.786
No. I know exactly
why I came in here.

06:28.319 --> 06:29.821
- I'm still mad at you.
- Really?

06:32.124 --> 06:34.223
Oh, Evan,
I swear to God, this house.

06:34.225 --> 06:36.461
If it's not one thing...
We have a mouse.

06:37.062 --> 06:37.963
Oh.

06:38.864 --> 06:39.932
I'll call Parsons.

06:40.232 --> 06:41.531
I thought we didn't like them.

06:41.533 --> 06:43.169
I'll get some traps.

06:43.367 --> 06:45.100
No, we're not killing
a little mouse like that.

06:45.102 --> 06:47.470
You'd rather pay Lloyd Parsons
a million dollars?

06:47.472 --> 06:48.941
I will sort it out.

06:50.307 --> 06:51.376
I've gotta clean that up.

06:56.782 --> 06:57.483
Thanks, buddy.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.336
This was in Florida,

07:19.004 --> 07:20.039
in the park.

07:24.074 --> 07:26.244
Oh, this is a good one.

07:27.078 --> 07:28.114
Damn it, Irene.

07:28.446 --> 07:30.015
They want a recent picture.

07:30.982 --> 07:32.051
Christ.

07:33.350 --> 07:34.853
You have a school picture,

07:35.987 --> 07:36.922
something like that?

07:44.862 --> 07:46.499
She made
varsity this year.

07:49.867 --> 07:51.870
Oh, beautiful.

07:54.071 --> 07:55.173
May I borrow this?

07:57.008 --> 07:58.077
It's my only copy.

07:58.475 --> 08:00.112
I'll get it back to you,
Mrs. Bonner,

08:00.312 --> 08:02.280
I promise, untouched.

08:07.451 --> 08:08.553
Are you serious?

08:18.463 --> 08:21.499
Over there, pink top,
talking to Pavel.

08:24.235 --> 08:25.870
God damn it.

08:26.937 --> 08:29.040
Why do all the good ones
go into sociology?

08:29.975 --> 08:32.244
Maybe you'll get lucky and
she'll audit your Ethics class.

08:34.279 --> 08:35.181
Hypothetical:

08:36.280 --> 08:38.249
a student approaches
you for one night of passion.

08:38.616 --> 08:40.419
She's beautiful, just your type.

08:41.217 --> 08:42.188
She's an adult.

08:43.121 --> 08:44.921
She has no interest
in ruining your career

08:44.923 --> 08:46.292
or your marriage
by telling anyone.

08:47.157 --> 08:48.593
All she wants is one night.

08:49.593 --> 08:50.496
Do you comply?

08:51.128 --> 08:52.130
Would she want extra credit?

08:53.265 --> 08:54.232
Answer the question.

08:55.266 --> 08:57.069
No, I do not comply.

08:58.002 --> 09:00.168
Aside from the blatant breach
of professional ethics,

09:00.170 --> 09:01.607
I have my marriage to consider.

09:03.040 --> 09:03.943
Fascinating.

09:04.809 --> 09:07.309
I recall reading
a certain book recently.

09:07.311 --> 09:08.947
The name of the author
escapes me,

09:09.948 --> 09:13.352
who said whether one experiences
guilt is a rational decision.

09:13.651 --> 09:15.384
You're misquoting.

09:15.386 --> 09:16.653
What I said was,
"One's experience of guilt

09:16.655 --> 09:18.156
is a conditioned response,

09:18.356 --> 09:20.492
which objective reasoning
can overcome."

09:20.925 --> 09:23.261
I'm saying,
objectively, she's hot,

09:23.560 --> 09:24.596
and she wants you.

09:26.097 --> 09:27.632
Whether you feel guilty
about it is up to you.

09:28.565 --> 09:29.901
Are you saying you would do it?

09:30.468 --> 09:31.402
Of course not.

09:31.602 --> 09:32.503
I'm married.

09:41.979 --> 09:43.346
Oh, hey. Sorry I'm late.

09:43.348 --> 09:45.150
I lost track of time.

09:46.016 --> 09:47.317
How was your first day back?

09:47.319 --> 09:48.319
You missed nothing.

09:49.420 --> 09:51.421
What are you guys
still doing up?

09:51.423 --> 09:52.989
Daddy! Daddy, there's a
crazy person in the woods.

09:52.991 --> 09:54.193
A crazy person in the woods?

09:54.391 --> 09:56.192
What do you mean?

09:56.194 --> 09:57.496
There's not a crazy person
in the woods, Adam.

09:57.963 --> 09:59.696
The only crazy person's you.

09:59.698 --> 10:00.598
Z.

10:07.237 --> 10:08.604
What's he talking about?

10:08.606 --> 10:10.976
Oh, a girl went missing
up at the lake,

10:11.175 --> 10:12.977
a cheerleader from Eastfield.

10:13.978 --> 10:15.378
Z told him
there's a crazy person

10:15.380 --> 10:17.312
in the woods who eats kids.

10:17.314 --> 10:19.117
Very Brothers Grimm.

10:20.017 --> 10:21.519
She's definitely
gonna be an English major.

10:22.120 --> 10:23.653
You know, I'm worried, actually,

10:23.655 --> 10:25.124
'cause the kids ride
their bikes up there.

10:25.457 --> 10:26.655
Was she lost or abducted?

10:26.657 --> 10:27.558
They don't know.

10:28.359 --> 10:29.692
You know, she's 17.

10:29.694 --> 10:31.063
She could have run away.

10:31.328 --> 10:34.230
Well, maybe we just say
no bikes after dark

10:34.232 --> 10:35.701
up at the lake
until they know more.

10:37.669 --> 10:39.004
What are you looking for?

10:40.304 --> 10:41.473
I thought you were saving that.

10:44.409 --> 10:45.444
What happened, Ev?

10:46.111 --> 10:47.146
Nothing.

10:47.511 --> 10:49.113
Well, nothing new, anyway.

10:50.647 --> 10:53.718
Santos read my book, though,
called it extraordinary.

10:55.020 --> 10:56.288
Well, isn't that good?

10:56.654 --> 10:58.657
Then right on cue, he brings
up my enrollment numbers

10:59.156 --> 11:00.655
and proceeds
to give me his thoughts

11:00.657 --> 11:02.627
for 20 of the longest minutes
of my life.

11:06.330 --> 11:07.298
Why the Chateau?

11:07.732 --> 11:09.201
Well, at this point, why not?

11:13.203 --> 11:15.741
I wonder sometimes if we made the
right choice coming down here.

11:16.641 --> 11:19.477
Well, we don't really have
much of a choice.

11:22.313 --> 11:23.549
To another school year.

11:28.352 --> 11:29.655
Okay, here's the drill.

11:31.423 --> 11:33.425
Right diagonal, left diagonal.

11:51.843 --> 11:53.176
Wow.

11:53.178 --> 11:54.509
Come on, ladies. Let's focus.

11:54.511 --> 11:55.513
We have to get this
down by tomorrow.

12:02.587 --> 12:04.086
Have fun storming the castle.

12:04.088 --> 12:05.620
- Bye!
- Bye.

12:05.622 --> 12:07.222
Have you ever thought
about going back to teaching

12:07.224 --> 12:08.124
when the kids
get a little older?

12:08.126 --> 12:09.127
No, thanks.

12:10.128 --> 12:11.793
Universities are elitist,
cutthroat places.

12:11.795 --> 12:13.296
364 days of the year,

12:13.298 --> 12:15.465
I don't even think about it.

12:15.467 --> 12:18.069
Well, I always tell people Ellen is
the smartest woman I know.

12:19.203 --> 12:20.570
Hey, how about high schools?

12:20.572 --> 12:22.074
Aren't they always
looking for, uh, subs?

12:22.640 --> 12:27.179
Oh, can you imagine what that
mother is going through?

12:28.313 --> 12:29.681
She is so young.

12:30.615 --> 12:32.447
I hope they catch whoever did it

12:32.449 --> 12:35.753
and fry his sicko A-S-S.

12:47.431 --> 12:48.699
Hi. Come on in.

12:58.642 --> 12:59.677
Anna.

13:00.277 --> 13:01.412
Thought I saw
your name on the roll.

13:01.646 --> 13:02.677
How was your summer?

13:02.679 --> 13:04.312
It was great, actually.

13:04.314 --> 13:06.682
Um, I went to Greece after all.

13:06.684 --> 13:07.884
- You did go? Fantastic.
- Mm-hmm.

13:07.886 --> 13:09.552
The cradle of philosophy.

13:09.554 --> 13:11.419
- How was it?
- It was amazing.

13:11.421 --> 13:13.422
I got a chance to read your book
while I was there,

13:13.424 --> 13:15.490
and, um, I was wondering...

13:15.492 --> 13:18.561
Like, I know you're probably
so over talking about it,

13:18.563 --> 13:22.565
but I would love to sit down with you
and... over coffee or something,

13:22.567 --> 13:24.366
you know,
and just pick your brain.

13:24.368 --> 13:26.701
Well, I am certainly
not over talking about it,

13:26.703 --> 13:28.437
but I don't
actually drink coffee.

13:28.439 --> 13:30.608
My, uh, office hours
are on the top there.

13:30.842 --> 13:31.742
Okay.

13:32.843 --> 13:34.146
Hi, everybody.

13:35.179 --> 13:37.415
I, uh, see some familiar faces,
which is good.

13:37.781 --> 13:41.420
We philosophers are a dying
breed, so safety in numbers.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.686
For those of you
who don't know me,

13:43.688 --> 13:46.389
I am Dr. Birch,
and this is Humanities 325,

13:46.391 --> 13:48.193
the Philosophy of Language.

13:51.728 --> 13:52.763
Uh...

13:53.765 --> 13:54.800
thought it seemed
a little crowded in here.

14:00.804 --> 14:03.206
- Ellen Birch?
- Yes.

14:03.208 --> 14:04.275
Is your husband home?

14:19.958 --> 14:21.193
Need help?

14:21.492 --> 14:23.661
Uh, no. It's all right. I...

14:23.995 --> 14:26.962
Well, I'm looking
for mousetraps.

14:26.964 --> 14:28.864
Just didn't expect
to see so many.

14:28.866 --> 14:30.869
I thought I'd just find
the old <i>Tom and Jerry</i> kind.

14:31.435 --> 14:32.470
Is this any good?

14:32.770 --> 14:34.673
Yeah, but they're kinda cruel.

14:35.439 --> 14:37.809
The little mouse gets stuck in
there and starves to death.

14:38.476 --> 14:39.674
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

14:39.676 --> 14:41.009
Hmm.

14:41.011 --> 14:42.677
But these ones
let you trap the mouse,

14:42.679 --> 14:43.714
then release it
in a field somewhere.

14:48.685 --> 14:51.320
Well, it's more
than I wanted to pay,

14:51.322 --> 14:53.625
but I guess it's the least I
could do for the little guy.

15:04.269 --> 15:05.337
Do you have a gun?

15:06.003 --> 15:07.436
Yes, I do.

15:07.438 --> 15:08.604
Can I see it?

15:08.606 --> 15:10.405
No, you may not.

15:10.407 --> 15:11.542
Why?

15:11.775 --> 15:14.246
Well, because guns
are dangerous.

15:14.511 --> 15:15.945
- Why?
- Well, because they are.

15:15.947 --> 15:17.980
Honey, let's just go
upstairs and play, okay?

15:17.982 --> 15:19.615
- But I wanna see it.
- I know you do,

15:19.617 --> 15:20.982
but you gotta go
upstairs and see...

15:20.984 --> 15:23.421
Play. Go. Go. Play.

15:25.455 --> 15:27.391
Yeah, they're curious
at that age.

15:31.328 --> 15:33.397
- Maybe you should give your husband another call.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

15:49.314 --> 15:50.515
Press okay.

15:52.349 --> 15:53.951
- What?
- Press okay.

15:54.919 --> 15:55.953
Yeah.

16:02.660 --> 16:03.629
Thank you.

17:01.953 --> 17:02.920
Ellen?

17:04.155 --> 17:05.455
Hey, what's wrong?

17:05.790 --> 17:07.056
Are the kids okay?

17:07.058 --> 17:07.923
Yeah, they're fine.
They're fine.

17:07.925 --> 17:09.525
Dr. Birch?

17:09.527 --> 17:11.394
Detective Robert Malloy.
Detective Killian.

17:11.396 --> 17:12.798
Officer Antonelli.

17:13.030 --> 17:14.800
Oh, hi. What can we do for you?
Is something wrong?

17:15.665 --> 17:19.369
Do you own
a gray 2015 Volvo S60?

17:26.911 --> 17:28.544
Where were you?
I've been calling you.

17:28.546 --> 17:30.349
I... I stopped
at the hardware store.

17:31.182 --> 17:32.550
What's this about, Detective?

17:33.617 --> 17:34.519
Well...

17:35.520 --> 17:38.656
girl from Eastfield
went missing a few days ago.

17:39.624 --> 17:40.492
We're looking into it.

17:41.158 --> 17:42.393
Joyce Bonner.

17:42.960 --> 17:43.862
Have you heard of her?

17:44.595 --> 17:45.497
No.

17:46.431 --> 17:48.663
Oh, so she was the girl
on the news, right?

17:48.665 --> 17:50.165
The... The, um, cheerleader.

17:50.167 --> 17:51.967
- Yeah.
- What does that have to do with us?

17:51.969 --> 17:55.069
Well, we got a report
a man in a gray Volvo

17:55.071 --> 17:57.074
was watching her
the day she disappeared.

17:57.908 --> 17:59.508
I'm sure it's nothing,

17:59.510 --> 18:01.379
but we're obliged
to look it up, you know.

18:02.146 --> 18:06.984
Can you tell me where you were
Thursday the 28th, about 3 p.m.?

18:07.819 --> 18:09.451
I doubt it, and...

18:09.453 --> 18:10.986
and my appointment book's
at school, so...

18:10.988 --> 18:13.721
At school?
Oh, you aren't a doctor?

18:13.723 --> 18:15.657
No, I'm a professor
at Addison University.

18:15.659 --> 18:17.726
I can look tomorrow,
give you a call.

18:17.728 --> 18:19.761
Your appointment book will tell you
where you were supposed to be,

18:19.763 --> 18:21.465
not necessarily
where you were.

18:22.500 --> 18:23.702
Yeah, suppose you're right.

18:24.100 --> 18:26.134
Whoa, what's going on?

18:26.136 --> 18:28.072
Hey, Z, go in the house, honey.

18:33.944 --> 18:37.749
Um, on the 28th, that was Z's
last day of camp,

18:38.115 --> 18:40.482
and you went to pick her up,
remember?

18:40.484 --> 18:42.183
- Mm-hmm. What camp is that?
- Yeah.

18:42.185 --> 18:44.220
Wildwood, Route 15.

18:44.222 --> 18:45.557
She got out at 3:30.

18:46.491 --> 18:47.692
- Yeah.
- Okay, that's fine.

18:49.092 --> 18:51.862
We'll just take a look inside
your car and be on our way.

18:52.062 --> 18:54.732
- Of course.
- Don't you need a warrant to do that? I mean...

18:55.198 --> 18:56.634
Not if we have your permission.

18:57.134 --> 18:58.767
Well, I'd give it,
but you still haven't said

18:58.769 --> 19:00.201
what this has to do with me.

19:00.203 --> 19:02.203
Well, according
to our witness, uh,

19:02.205 --> 19:06.077
the vehicle had a Addison sticker
on the front windshield.

19:06.944 --> 19:08.943
Uh, well, it could be a mistake.

19:08.945 --> 19:10.512
I mean, as my wife said,

19:10.514 --> 19:11.946
I was picking up
our daughter from camp,

19:11.948 --> 19:14.149
and Wildwood's 30 miles
from the lake, so...

19:14.151 --> 19:15.787
How'd you know she
disappeared from the lake?

19:16.654 --> 19:17.689
It was on the news.

19:18.021 --> 19:20.524
Z, your mom said
to wait inside, please.

19:21.192 --> 19:23.962
Dr. Birch, uh,
this is pretty routine.

19:24.662 --> 19:27.262
Really? It's routine to make insinuations
in front of my daughter? Wow.

19:27.264 --> 19:29.064
Why don't you just calm down,
sir?

19:29.066 --> 19:30.833
I'm perfectly calm, sir.

19:30.835 --> 19:31.636
- Honey, they're just doing their job.
- I...

19:33.271 --> 19:35.037
Do you mind if we look
inside your vehicle?

19:35.039 --> 19:36.105
No, of course not.

19:36.107 --> 19:37.809
Yes, actually, I do mind.

19:43.047 --> 19:44.082
Who's back there?

19:45.782 --> 19:47.218
What makes you think anyone is?

19:48.219 --> 19:52.023
A presumption based on scenes
from television and movies.

19:53.156 --> 19:55.493
Well, in the real world,
we got things called budgets.

19:56.594 --> 19:59.662
We can't afford to have anyone standing
around, watching us do our jobs.

20:00.964 --> 20:02.032
Now...

20:04.868 --> 20:07.505
what time did you
have to pick up your daughter?

20:07.771 --> 20:09.674
3:30, give or take.

20:09.973 --> 20:10.876
Give or take what?

20:11.709 --> 20:12.878
Five, ten minutes.

20:14.011 --> 20:16.811
I mean, these things rarely
end at even times, you know.

20:16.813 --> 20:19.914
It's always 32
or 17 minutes past and...

20:19.916 --> 20:21.215
Did you get there on time?

20:21.217 --> 20:22.987
- Yeah.
- Exactly on time?

20:23.687 --> 20:24.989
Little early?

20:25.822 --> 20:27.626
I told you.
I don't remember.

20:28.725 --> 20:31.026
As my daughter is only nine,

20:31.028 --> 20:32.861
she's unable to obtain
a driver's license,

20:32.863 --> 20:34.930
and consequently,
I give her many rides.

20:34.932 --> 20:36.365
This particular instance

20:36.367 --> 20:38.168
did not leave
a significant impression.

20:40.236 --> 20:41.772
Did you ever meet Joyce Bonner?

20:42.205 --> 20:43.107
Uh...

20:43.907 --> 20:45.309
- I don't think so.
- You could have?

20:46.309 --> 20:48.777
I don't remember meeting
somebody with that name,

20:48.779 --> 20:50.712
but I meet a lot of young
people at the college.

20:50.714 --> 20:52.149
It's conceivable that I met her.

20:52.782 --> 20:54.785
What I'm sure of is that
I don't know if I have.

20:55.219 --> 20:57.152
When we asked if you'd heard
of her disappearance,

20:57.154 --> 20:59.821
you said, "She was
a cheerleader, right?"

20:59.823 --> 21:00.858
Do you remember saying that?

21:01.291 --> 21:02.260
Yeah.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.796
"She <i>was</i> a cheerleader"?

21:05.896 --> 21:07.195
Well, I was speaking offhand.

21:07.197 --> 21:09.131
I'm sure she still
is a cheerleader,

21:09.133 --> 21:10.865
except that she's missing,
and I'm...

21:10.867 --> 21:12.636
I'm guessing she's not off
cheerleading somewhere.

21:13.671 --> 21:17.405
Philosophy.
"I think, therefore I am,"

21:17.407 --> 21:19.008
that kind of thing?

21:19.010 --> 21:20.409
Well, I teach Descartes
in my intro class,

21:20.411 --> 21:22.280
but I specialize in linguistics,

21:23.347 --> 21:24.883
the philosophy of language.

21:25.649 --> 21:27.785
Oh. Um...

21:28.085 --> 21:31.189
pardon my ignorance,
but what does a philosopher do?

21:31.422 --> 21:33.058
What's so funny?

21:33.790 --> 21:36.261
Uh, well, it's one of the
great questions, isn't it?

21:37.293 --> 21:38.826
You might consider philosophy

21:38.828 --> 21:40.598
the logical
clarification of thoughts.

21:41.698 --> 21:42.897
But I'm more of a teacher

21:42.899 --> 21:44.034
than a practicing philosopher.

21:45.301 --> 21:47.137
This is relevant somehow, is it?

21:47.437 --> 21:49.674
We never know what's relevant
until we hear it.

21:51.308 --> 21:54.977
You might consider
crime investigation

21:54.979 --> 21:57.315
the logical clarification
of evidence.

21:58.816 --> 22:00.348
You live close by the lake,
don't you?

22:00.350 --> 22:01.719
You ever go up there?

22:02.252 --> 22:03.419
Yeah, sometimes.

22:03.421 --> 22:04.723
Did you ever rent a kayak?

22:04.989 --> 22:06.091
No.

22:06.322 --> 22:08.022
You ever remember
seeing a young girl,

22:08.024 --> 22:12.196
17, brunette, worked
around the kayak stand?

22:12.863 --> 22:14.328
Uh, can't say that I do.

22:14.330 --> 22:16.065
You mean you don't remember?

22:16.067 --> 22:17.965
That's right. I don't remember
seeing a young girl,

22:17.967 --> 22:22.139
uh, let alone a brunette one,
working at the kayak rental.

22:23.073 --> 22:24.807
I've never been
to the kayak rental.

22:24.809 --> 22:27.108
I've... I've never sent anybody
to the kayak rental.

22:27.110 --> 22:28.911
In fact, I've never even thought
about the kayak rental

22:28.913 --> 22:31.216
until now, till you bring it up.

22:31.448 --> 22:32.916
You enjoying yourself?

22:33.283 --> 22:37.388
Hmm. Well,
too bad about your memory.

22:54.805 --> 22:55.774
Right.

22:56.072 --> 22:58.142
Thank you for your time,
Professor.

22:59.777 --> 23:01.175
I'm not under arrest anymore?

23:01.177 --> 23:02.079
You never were.

23:03.380 --> 23:06.448
We have your numbers, so we'll
contact you again if we need you.

23:06.450 --> 23:07.816
At my office, please.

23:07.818 --> 23:09.087
Of course. Thanks for your help.

23:10.154 --> 23:11.189
You're welcome.

23:19.930 --> 23:20.999
Everything's fine.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.301
I just answered some questions,
and then I left.

23:25.469 --> 23:26.771
What did they want to know?

23:27.771 --> 23:30.974
Uh, well, where I'd been,
how long I was there,

23:31.841 --> 23:34.713
whether I'd met, um...
what's her name?

23:35.980 --> 23:37.781
- Joyce Bonner.
- Bonner, yeah.

23:39.783 --> 23:40.484
Had you...

23:41.318 --> 23:42.287
met her?

23:42.787 --> 23:43.922
Why would I have?

23:44.954 --> 23:46.256
I just told them
everything I knew,

23:46.490 --> 23:48.026
they thanked me,
and that was that.

23:48.459 --> 23:50.459
You didn't save a plate,
did you? I'm really starved.

23:50.461 --> 23:52.230
- A plate?
- Yeah.

23:53.463 --> 23:55.396
Adam cried for an hour,

23:55.398 --> 23:56.934
because he thought
you went to jail.

23:58.868 --> 24:00.271
You're acting
like this is my fault.

24:00.503 --> 24:02.005
They just wanted
to look in the car.

24:02.438 --> 24:04.038
There's a thing called
the Fourth Amendment.

24:04.040 --> 24:06.240
Oh, my God.
A girl is missing, Evan.

24:06.242 --> 24:07.442
I know. I know.

24:07.444 --> 24:08.747
Has it even crossed your mind?

24:09.312 --> 24:11.346
What... What if it was Zelda?

24:11.348 --> 24:13.217
What if someone pulled the same
macho bullshit you pulled today?

24:16.020 --> 24:18.356
Yeah, well, maybe I overreacted.

24:20.191 --> 24:21.455
What were you thinking?

24:21.457 --> 24:22.958
Well, they were
pushing me around.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.129
I got defensive.

24:26.363 --> 24:28.299
I was stupid, I... I know. I...

24:29.300 --> 24:31.802
I just should have
let 'em do what they wanted.

24:34.838 --> 24:35.807
How is Adam?

24:37.073 --> 24:38.275
You should talk to him.

24:40.578 --> 24:42.544
- And Z?
- She's fine.

24:42.546 --> 24:43.848
You should talk to her, too.

24:47.151 --> 24:48.186
What about you?

24:49.520 --> 24:50.555
Did I scare you, too?

24:52.289 --> 24:53.324
I'm sorry.

25:47.677 --> 25:50.345
Zeno's Progressive
Dichotomy Paradox

25:50.347 --> 25:53.151
proposes that before
a person can walk across a room,

25:53.349 --> 25:54.551
he must go halfway.

25:55.219 --> 25:56.550
But before he gets halfway,

25:56.552 --> 25:58.619
he must cover
a quarter that distance,

25:58.621 --> 26:02.359
and so on and so on to an infinite
number of decreasing distances.

26:02.960 --> 26:06.965
Based on this logic, the man was
never able to take the first step.

26:07.630 --> 26:10.033
Zeno demonstrated, in a way,

26:11.100 --> 26:12.169
that motion was impossible.

26:15.138 --> 26:16.241
Mr. Barnes.

26:16.973 --> 26:17.641
Here.

26:18.509 --> 26:20.211
Do you agree with Zeno?

26:21.145 --> 26:23.213
Um, yes.

26:23.713 --> 26:25.980
So you will be unable
to leave this room

26:25.982 --> 26:27.652
after my thrilling
lecture is over?

26:28.251 --> 26:29.354
Looks like we're all stuck here.

26:31.088 --> 26:33.124
Well, I mean,
it's a play on words.

26:33.357 --> 26:35.026
It makes sense, but it doesn't.

26:35.224 --> 26:36.526
Yeah, you're on the right track.

26:37.027 --> 26:39.931
A paradox exposes
the limits of language.

26:40.263 --> 26:41.596
We all know from experience

26:41.598 --> 26:43.166
that we are able
to walk across a room.

26:43.533 --> 26:46.370
It's only in our language
that uncertainty arises.

26:47.503 --> 26:51.341
Do you have a dollar in the same
way that you have a headache?

26:53.010 --> 26:55.210
As long as there
are verbs like "to be"

26:55.212 --> 26:59.080
or adjectives like "true" or
"false," we will continue...

26:59.082 --> 27:01.184
and this is a quote from
our friend Wittgenstein...

27:02.051 --> 27:04.318
we will continue
to "Stare at something

27:04.320 --> 27:06.624
which no explanation
seems able to remove."

27:08.358 --> 27:10.994
- Yes.
- So there's no such thing as truth?

27:12.296 --> 27:13.398
Well, let me ask you this.

27:14.030 --> 27:15.465
Can I tell you the truth,

27:16.800 --> 27:19.601
or can I tell you what I perceive
or interpret as the truth,

27:19.603 --> 27:21.039
as best my memory will allow?

27:23.507 --> 27:24.772
Anyway, we're getting
ahead of ourselves,

27:24.774 --> 27:27.477
so let's stick with the paradox.

27:28.412 --> 27:29.514
One crumb at a time.

27:37.453 --> 27:38.990
Hi. Am I early?

27:39.322 --> 27:41.224
No. No. I'm just getting a jump
on these. Come in.

27:42.425 --> 27:43.427
Oh, you can leave that open.

27:44.094 --> 27:44.996
Okay.

27:46.562 --> 27:48.130
How's your semester so far?

27:48.132 --> 27:50.134
Hectic.

27:50.367 --> 27:52.069
I'm taking 18 units.

27:52.336 --> 27:53.738
Eighteen?

27:55.806 --> 27:57.071
That's pretty.

27:57.073 --> 27:57.975
That new?

27:59.675 --> 28:01.343
Oh. Oh, yeah.

28:01.345 --> 28:03.280
I got that in, um,
Boston over summer.

28:04.481 --> 28:05.516
You've got a good memory.

28:06.383 --> 28:07.684
I can barely remember last week.

28:09.586 --> 28:11.189
Do you remember...

28:12.556 --> 28:13.558
last semester?

28:17.461 --> 28:18.695
I'll take that as a yes.

28:19.530 --> 28:20.729
We don't have to bring that up.

28:20.731 --> 28:22.367
No, I... I'd rather we did.

28:25.069 --> 28:26.236
Should I get the door now?

28:28.137 --> 28:29.040
Yeah.

28:38.816 --> 28:41.386
I wanted to apologize.

28:42.618 --> 28:45.619
Um, I was in a pretty bad place
last year,

28:45.621 --> 28:46.523
and...

28:47.691 --> 28:48.593
you were...

28:49.292 --> 28:50.494
You tried to help me,

28:50.828 --> 28:55.366
and I took advantage of that
in a really big way.

28:55.632 --> 28:58.703
And, um, I want to say
that it was a...

28:59.168 --> 29:02.239
a moment of weakness,
but it wasn't that.

29:02.505 --> 29:05.242
It was just a moment
where I didn't think,

29:06.210 --> 29:10.715
and... I want you to know
how stupid I felt

29:11.682 --> 29:13.550
and how truly sorry I am.

29:15.184 --> 29:17.422
Well, Anna,
I appreciate your candor

29:17.788 --> 29:19.057
and your honesty,

29:19.423 --> 29:21.224
and I accept your apology.
Thank you.

29:22.126 --> 29:25.062
I just want us to forget
about it and be normal.

29:25.863 --> 29:28.130
Well, if you're willing to
rebuild the trust between us,

29:28.132 --> 29:29.167
then so am I.

29:31.434 --> 29:33.434
You're such
an incredible person.

29:33.436 --> 29:34.702
- Ah.
- And I mean that

29:34.704 --> 29:36.540
in a strictly platonic way.
I do.

29:37.875 --> 29:40.208
And I actually
did come to talk to you

29:40.210 --> 29:41.710
about your book if that's okay.

29:41.712 --> 29:43.448
Great.

29:44.780 --> 29:46.615
Wow, I wish some of my critics

29:46.617 --> 29:48.415
read it as thoroughly
as it looks like you have.

29:48.417 --> 29:50.184
Or even some of my colleagues,
for that matter.

29:51.387 --> 29:52.290
Come in.

29:53.857 --> 29:55.760
Hmm. Good afternoon, Professor.

29:56.460 --> 29:57.395
You got a second?

29:57.927 --> 29:59.326
W... Well, as you can see,

29:59.328 --> 30:00.394
I'm with a student right now.

30:00.396 --> 30:01.299
It'll just take a second.

30:02.598 --> 30:03.800
Hmm, look at that.

30:04.600 --> 30:05.469
You write that?

30:05.702 --> 30:06.570
Yeah.

30:07.203 --> 30:07.871
Thick.

30:08.705 --> 30:09.403
Actually, do you mind
waiting outside,

30:09.405 --> 30:11.272
and I'll see you in a moment?

30:11.274 --> 30:12.709
Sure. Take your time.

30:41.504 --> 30:43.140
How long have you known
the good doctor?

30:45.908 --> 30:46.810
Few years.

30:48.845 --> 30:49.944
Nice guy?

30:51.581 --> 30:53.316
Everybody here is nuts.

31:03.961 --> 31:05.492
I actually have
a meeting off campus,

31:05.494 --> 31:06.795
so I don't really have
time to talk.

31:06.797 --> 31:08.566
No problem. I'll walk with you.

31:09.765 --> 31:12.402
I wanted to talk
to you about the 28th some more.

31:12.970 --> 31:14.635
You wanted to, past tense?

31:14.637 --> 31:16.471
Have circumstances changed?

31:16.473 --> 31:17.675
Ah, figure of speech.

31:18.242 --> 31:19.443
I want to talk to you now.

31:19.842 --> 31:20.911
Well, you're talking to me.

31:21.611 --> 31:22.978
You said you picked up
your daughter

31:22.980 --> 31:24.815
from camp that day.
Is that correct?

31:25.249 --> 31:26.480
Yes, that's what I said.

31:26.482 --> 31:27.885
Mm-hmm. Is that what you did?

31:29.219 --> 31:30.785
Well, considering my daughter is
not still at camp waiting for me,

31:30.787 --> 31:32.787
I'd say, uh, yes,
that's what I did.

31:32.789 --> 31:34.525
- No stops?
- No stops.

31:35.024 --> 31:37.491
Camp counselor said she waited
with your daughter

31:37.493 --> 31:39.329
for 40 minutes
before you showed up.

31:40.830 --> 31:42.934
Well, is tardiness
a crime these days?

31:43.532 --> 31:45.936
No, but obstruction is.

31:49.505 --> 31:50.607
And how am I doing that?

31:56.980 --> 31:58.348
Where did you get my notes?

31:59.316 --> 32:01.452
Found it in a garbage can
up by the lake.

32:02.886 --> 32:05.522
You sure you didn't stop there,
maybe on the way?

32:06.990 --> 32:08.455
I... It's possible.

32:08.457 --> 32:10.560
I... I-- I go
to the lake sometimes.

32:10.894 --> 32:12.863
I sit in my car. I do work,

32:13.463 --> 32:16.334
look out at the water, and
just clear my head, you know?

32:17.033 --> 32:18.735
And is that what you did
on the 28th?

32:18.934 --> 32:20.801
I don't remember. I might have.

32:20.803 --> 32:23.605
I might have gone there
that morning or the day before.

32:23.607 --> 32:24.908
I... I-- I can't be certain.

32:26.542 --> 32:29.746
What I'm sure of is that I... I had nothing
to do with this girl's disappearance, so...

32:30.981 --> 32:32.946
Look, do... do you have
any more questions?

32:32.948 --> 32:34.316
'Cause I really need to go.

32:34.318 --> 32:36.453
No. No more questions.

32:37.386 --> 32:38.553
Thank you.

32:55.472 --> 32:57.571
Dr. Birch, your car
has been impounded

32:57.573 --> 32:59.406
by the Hillside
Police Department.

32:59.408 --> 33:01.409
The car will be returned
when the department...

33:01.411 --> 33:02.280
You're kidding?

33:03.379 --> 33:05.547
I've been nothing
but cooperative.

33:05.549 --> 33:08.016
Well, since your statement

33:08.018 --> 33:10.384
contradicted
the physical evidence...

33:10.386 --> 33:12.354
- Contradicted?
- ...we thought a thorough search of your car...

33:12.356 --> 33:13.454
And this is how you do it?
You leave me stranded at work?

33:13.456 --> 33:14.888
Ah, listen.

33:14.890 --> 33:16.724
I tried to tell you
the tow truck was here,

33:16.726 --> 33:18.461
- but you had me wait.
- You didn't tr...

33:19.829 --> 33:21.096
This is unbelievable.

33:21.098 --> 33:22.730
- This is theft.
- Believe me,

33:22.732 --> 33:24.501
I want to clear this up
faster than anybody.

33:24.800 --> 33:26.901
Now, let's just go back
to those 40 minutes.

33:26.903 --> 33:28.903
Look, you can arrest me,
if that's your intention.

33:28.905 --> 33:31.375
I'm not answering another question
until I speak to my lawyer.

33:35.611 --> 33:38.581
Honestly, I wish
you called me earlier.

33:39.049 --> 33:40.781
I just thought if I answered
their questions,

33:40.783 --> 33:41.819
it would go away.

33:42.386 --> 33:43.518
That's what everybody thinks,

33:43.520 --> 33:45.388
but cops don't ask questions.

33:45.888 --> 33:47.689
They plant land mines.
It's okay, though.

33:47.691 --> 33:49.391
We're... We're in good shape.

33:49.393 --> 33:50.928
Paul, I know
you mostly handle divorces.

33:51.461 --> 33:53.862
- Divorces, malpractice, fraud.
- Uh...

33:53.864 --> 33:55.930
This town's too small
to specialize.

33:55.932 --> 33:58.967
I'm just wondering if... you know,
are you used to a case like this?

33:58.969 --> 34:00.471
Well, do you mean a kidnapping,

34:00.837 --> 34:01.838
or do you mean a murder?

34:02.772 --> 34:05.509
Maybe a rape, runaway kid,
hostage situation?

34:05.709 --> 34:08.646
I don't know what kind of case this
is, and frankly, neither do they.

34:09.078 --> 34:11.978
They don't have a body,
a cause of death, a motive.

34:11.981 --> 34:13.449
They don't even have
a crime yet.

34:13.748 --> 34:15.984
All they do have is
an uncorroborated statement

34:15.985 --> 34:18.455
and a warrant I wouldn't pick up
my dog's poop with.

34:18.888 --> 34:20.654
You gonna try those ribs?
'Cause I'm telling you,

34:20.656 --> 34:21.623
they're gonna change your life.

34:22.626 --> 34:23.960
So what should we do now?

34:24.659 --> 34:26.460
Stay on defense.
You did the right thing

34:26.463 --> 34:28.429
not letting them
search your car,

34:28.431 --> 34:29.899
- because now if they find anything...
- They won't.

34:30.199 --> 34:32.435
But if they do,
we can get it thrown out.

34:33.437 --> 34:35.168
Look, this...
this isn't some metropolis.

34:35.170 --> 34:38.071
When a kid goes missing here,
everybody knows about it.

34:38.072 --> 34:40.143
The cops need a suspect, fast.

34:40.543 --> 34:41.875
They get sloppy.

34:41.877 --> 34:43.511
Coincidence put you
in the crosshairs.

34:43.513 --> 34:44.614
That's the plain shit of it.

34:46.081 --> 34:48.551
Good news is all we have to do
is nudge 'em to one side.

34:56.592 --> 34:57.495
Hey.

35:00.564 --> 35:02.095
Oh, by the way, Deb wants

35:02.097 --> 35:02.999
to have you guys over
for dinner sometime.

35:03.566 --> 35:04.799
Oh, great.

35:04.801 --> 35:05.770
I'm sure Ellen would like that.

35:07.470 --> 35:08.505
Check the stalls.

35:09.039 --> 35:11.475
- Huh?
- The stalls. Check.

35:20.015 --> 35:21.915
You understand
that I'm your attorney

35:21.917 --> 35:25.088
and any communication
between us is privileged, right?

35:26.823 --> 35:27.725
Yeah.

35:28.859 --> 35:30.027
Then I want to get this clear.

35:31.227 --> 35:34.162
You did not have a relationship
with Joyce Bonner, correct?

35:34.164 --> 35:35.064
Correct.

35:36.098 --> 35:38.600
Are you currently involved
in or have you ever had

35:38.602 --> 35:40.004
a sexual relationship
with a minor?

35:40.269 --> 35:41.171
No.

35:42.004 --> 35:43.604
How 'bout college age?

35:43.606 --> 35:46.274
- Paul, please.
- Look, this cop, Malloy,

35:46.276 --> 35:48.712
he's gonna try to establish
a pattern of behavior.

35:49.778 --> 35:51.514
- Is he gonna find one?
- No, he's not.

35:51.914 --> 35:53.983
Look, I... I don't know
this girl. I never have.

35:54.917 --> 35:56.750
Is that good enough?

35:56.752 --> 35:58.689
For me, yeah, but I'm not
the one you have to convince.

35:59.656 --> 36:00.888
Look, I'll call you soon.

36:00.890 --> 36:03.560
In the meantime, try and relax.

36:11.801 --> 36:13.136
Son of a bitch.

36:25.649 --> 36:26.717
Carrie's not working today?

36:27.216 --> 36:28.117
No.

36:30.921 --> 36:32.022
Just, uh, press okay.

36:44.568 --> 36:46.234
<i>...closed
two lanes of northbound traffi.</i>

36:46.236 --> 36:48.638
<i>Highway Patrol

36:57.080 --> 36:58.111
<i>Authorities are...</i>

37:01.151 --> 37:02.185
Don't you think
we should listen?

37:02.986 --> 37:04.352
Unless it's a headline
that says,

37:04.354 --> 37:06.756
"Police return professor's car,"
then no.

37:13.129 --> 37:14.031
What?

37:33.350 --> 37:35.149
<i>Classmates of Joyce Bonner
held a vigil</i>

37:35.151 --> 37:36.950
<i>last night

37:36.952 --> 37:39.386

<i>Traffic is back to normal after

38:03.379 --> 38:05.113
Sorry, ma'am.
The beach is closed.

38:19.095 --> 38:21.131
And if you could just sign
right there, please.

38:23.232 --> 38:25.667
- The printer working?
- Thank you.

38:25.669 --> 38:28.739
Uh, the stuff you printed
is... is right here.

38:30.173 --> 38:32.874
Ah. Catching up on this story.

38:32.876 --> 38:33.910
I haven't been following it.

38:34.144 --> 38:35.178
What story?

38:37.080 --> 38:38.215
Oh, that.

38:39.281 --> 38:42.118
My cousin has a friend
who is a cop.

38:42.452 --> 38:44.988
He said they...
they know who did it.

38:45.220 --> 38:46.255
You don't say.

38:46.722 --> 38:47.724
Well, I hope they catch him.

38:47.957 --> 38:49.223
Oh, they will.

38:49.225 --> 38:51.362
They're watching him 24/7.

38:57.267 --> 38:58.402
Birch, you ready?

38:58.901 --> 38:59.802
Yeah.

39:07.810 --> 39:08.879
So what's the prognosis?

39:09.879 --> 39:10.781
Huh?

39:11.281 --> 39:12.316
Your car.

39:13.482 --> 39:14.385
Oh, uh,

39:15.285 --> 39:17.321
uh, the transmission.

39:18.888 --> 39:19.790
You okay?

39:21.156 --> 39:21.925
Yeah, just...

39:24.794 --> 39:26.259
endured a new form
of shame today.

39:26.261 --> 39:29.265
I had two students
in my 103 lecture.

39:31.267 --> 39:32.169
Two.

39:33.336 --> 39:34.370
That's nothing.

39:34.937 --> 39:36.006
I got that beat.

39:37.006 --> 39:39.443
I remember a few years back,
I went a whole week,

39:40.109 --> 39:44.511
a whole week,
and not one person showed up.

40:09.339 --> 40:12.272
...whole week,
I'm out there, and I have to...

40:30.260 --> 40:31.462
I need this, buddy. Come on.

40:32.327 --> 40:33.895
Anyway,

40:33.897 --> 40:36.330
You know,
I just kept teaching,

40:36.332 --> 40:37.564
wrote quotes on the board,

40:37.566 --> 40:39.769
you know, whole nine yards.

40:40.135 --> 40:41.938
Did you catch
the mouse yet, Daddy?

40:43.039 --> 40:45.441
No. No, but I put some more food
in the traps.

40:46.910 --> 40:47.810
Plural?

40:48.577 --> 40:49.812
Yeah. I bought some more.

40:50.780 --> 40:53.080
Can I go with you to set it free
in the field?

40:53.082 --> 40:54.451
Sure. We can all go.

40:54.950 --> 40:57.086
It'll be a Birch family
field trip.

40:57.586 --> 40:59.155
You know,
speaking of field trips,

41:00.289 --> 41:01.955
it's meant to be nice
this weekend.

41:01.957 --> 41:03.894
I was thinking maybe
we could go to the beach.

41:04.294 --> 41:05.194
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

41:05.595 --> 41:06.530
Does that sound fun?

41:07.497 --> 41:08.397
Sure.

41:09.298 --> 41:11.100
It bothers me when you do that,
you know.

41:11.533 --> 41:13.369
What? Brush my teeth?

41:14.403 --> 41:15.772
No, the trip to the beach,

41:17.439 --> 41:19.342
just popping it
on the kids like that.

41:20.410 --> 41:21.609
What if I had something to do?

41:21.611 --> 41:22.980
Then I'd be the bad guy.

41:24.446 --> 41:26.883
Well, Evan, I mean,

41:27.984 --> 41:29.316
just came into my head.

41:29.318 --> 41:31.017
I wasn't trying
to pop it or anything.

41:31.019 --> 41:32.488
I mean, do you
have something to do?

41:32.955 --> 41:35.089
No. But I don't know.

41:35.091 --> 41:38.060
I just think I should stay around
here in case Paul calls or something.

41:39.863 --> 41:43.399
Well, maybe it'd do you good
to... get away from it all.

41:44.499 --> 41:46.000
Doesn't really matter
where I go, does it?

41:46.002 --> 41:46.904
I'm still...

41:55.377 --> 41:56.446
We'll go. We'll get away.

41:57.213 --> 41:58.115
It'll be good.

42:08.191 --> 42:10.057
Okay.

42:10.059 --> 42:11.294
I'm all set out here.

42:11.593 --> 42:13.496
Adam, Z, come on! We're going!

42:14.530 --> 42:15.432
Super Dude?

42:16.164 --> 42:17.497
Is Adam coming to the beach?

42:17.499 --> 42:19.232
No, he's got chores.

42:19.234 --> 42:20.368
- He's got chores?
- Z!

42:20.370 --> 42:21.505
Hey, can you feed Marvin?

42:21.970 --> 42:23.173
Z, come on. We're going.

42:24.006 --> 42:26.207
Hey, what have I told you

42:26.209 --> 42:28.178
about going into my makeup
without permission?

42:28.443 --> 42:29.345
I didn't.

42:29.611 --> 42:30.513
Well, where'd you get that?

42:31.046 --> 42:31.948
I found it.

42:32.381 --> 42:33.613
You found it?

42:33.615 --> 42:36.052
Ew. That's not sanitary, honey.

42:36.519 --> 42:39.289
I didn't find it
on the street. Gosh.

42:39.955 --> 42:41.290
I found it in Dad's car.

42:43.693 --> 42:44.595
When?

42:45.193 --> 42:46.359
When we washed it.

42:46.361 --> 42:47.928
It was in the back seat,

42:47.930 --> 42:49.198
so I didn't think
you wanted it anymore.

42:51.434 --> 42:52.569
Yeah, well, I want it.

42:55.405 --> 42:57.138
Uh, will you go wash your face?

42:57.140 --> 42:58.506
You don't need to wear
makeup to the beach.

42:58.508 --> 43:00.477
- But...
- Just wash your face, okay?

43:16.191 --> 43:17.159
Okay.

43:20.463 --> 43:22.031
Where do you want to be?

43:23.231 --> 43:24.333
Right here?

43:24.566 --> 43:25.568
Right here?

43:31.106 --> 43:32.208
Maybe, yeah.

43:32.607 --> 43:33.510
Why's that?

43:48.357 --> 43:49.493
We should take a trip.

43:50.526 --> 43:51.995
- Hmm?
- A trip.

43:53.595 --> 43:55.631
We didn't have
a summer vacation this year.

43:57.133 --> 43:58.268
We should go back to Spain.

43:59.702 --> 44:00.703
Wouldn't that be fun?

44:02.205 --> 44:03.340
Go back to our cafe.

44:05.107 --> 44:06.410
You know, we should
actually move there.

44:07.176 --> 44:09.980
We should buy that cafe.
You could run it.

44:10.646 --> 44:12.245
I could teach English somewhere,

44:12.247 --> 44:13.383
and the kids could be bilingual.

44:14.450 --> 44:16.153
Okay.

44:24.327 --> 44:25.593
You said something
to me that day.

44:25.595 --> 44:27.127
You promised me something.

44:27.129 --> 44:28.365
You remember what you said?

44:29.499 --> 44:30.399
Uh...

44:31.667 --> 44:33.437
You promised you'd always
tell me the truth.

44:36.305 --> 44:37.207
What?

44:38.040 --> 44:39.640
That was before
I went back to school.

44:39.642 --> 44:41.441
It sounds like something
I would have said.

44:41.443 --> 44:42.712
Oh, you mean you wouldn't
promise me that now?

44:43.111 --> 44:44.280
No. I...

44:44.479 --> 44:46.212
Well, I can't actually
promise you that.

44:46.214 --> 44:47.383
Nobody can. I mean,

44:48.818 --> 44:51.151
what I should have said
was that I...

44:51.153 --> 44:54.256
I promise to always tell you what I
interpret and remember as the truth.

44:55.457 --> 44:57.293
I like
your original promise better.

44:58.560 --> 45:00.196
That's the one
I'm gonna hold you to.

45:05.167 --> 45:06.169
Pizza?

45:06.368 --> 45:07.401
Yeah. I'll just put him down.

45:27.823 --> 45:29.156
What is it, honey?

45:29.158 --> 45:31.091
Marvin's gone! Marvin's gone!

45:31.093 --> 45:32.493
He's gone?

45:32.495 --> 45:33.560
Oh, honey,
we'll find him.

45:33.562 --> 45:34.430
How'd he get out?

45:35.164 --> 45:36.796
Well, I don't know.

45:36.798 --> 45:39.135
Did I leave his door open
when I fed him this morning?

45:39.602 --> 45:41.167
I'm sorry, honey.
We'll find him.

45:41.169 --> 45:42.669
He'll be here somewhere.
We'll find him.

45:42.671 --> 45:43.673
Marvin!

45:45.307 --> 45:47.143
- Marvin!
- Marvin!

45:47.776 --> 45:49.612
Marvin!

45:49.879 --> 45:52.182
- Did you look under the tree?
- Marvin!

45:53.749 --> 45:55.051
Marvin!

45:58.321 --> 45:59.356
Marvin!

46:13.135 --> 46:14.435
We'll get her another one.

46:14.437 --> 46:15.505
She doesn't want another one.

46:16.839 --> 46:18.439
I'm sorry.

46:18.441 --> 46:20.341
I know you are.
She knows you are.

46:20.343 --> 46:22.212
It's just gonna take her a
little while to forgive you.

46:23.278 --> 46:24.712
We were just
so rushed this morning.

46:24.714 --> 46:26.379
Okay, Evan, please don't do

46:26.381 --> 46:29.183
the whole absent-minded
professor thing.

46:29.185 --> 46:33.453
It used to be cute, and I just...
I need you here from now on.

46:33.455 --> 46:34.522
We all do.

46:34.524 --> 46:35.525
It was an honest mistake.

46:36.158 --> 46:37.461
I'm not just talking
about the rabbit.

46:39.896 --> 46:41.131
I can't move again.

46:48.537 --> 46:50.306
Leave that on.
I'm gonna stay up.

46:50.740 --> 46:51.607
Fine.

47:32.481 --> 47:33.617
I'm gonna staple this one.

47:42.457 --> 47:43.459
Good.

47:56.939 --> 47:59.176
Uh, what was I saying?

47:59.874 --> 48:04.446
Oh, well, whatever it was,
it can wait.

48:04.714 --> 48:05.946
That's the beauty of time.

48:05.948 --> 48:07.317
There's always more of it.

48:07.950 --> 48:09.015
I will see you next week.

48:37.812 --> 48:38.714
...great.

48:39.948 --> 48:41.217
That's great, Barbara.

48:47.555 --> 48:49.425
Okay. Thank you.

49:07.376 --> 49:08.444
Long day, Professor?

49:09.678 --> 49:10.977
Need a ride?

49:10.979 --> 49:12.881
No, I'll be fine
on the bus. Thanks.

49:13.381 --> 49:15.515
Well, I've still got
some time right now

49:15.517 --> 49:17.484
if, uh, you wanna grab
some coffee.

49:17.486 --> 49:18.722
I don't drink coffee, remember?

49:19.021 --> 49:21.758
Well, they have tea
and juice and water.

49:22.357 --> 49:23.392
You do drink water?

49:29.097 --> 49:30.399
Mrs. Birch.

49:30.598 --> 49:31.832
My husband's not here.
He's at work.

49:31.834 --> 49:32.969
I know.

49:33.502 --> 49:35.038
I'd like to talk to you
if you have a moment.

49:39.008 --> 49:41.278
I get it,
but I don't agree.

49:41.843 --> 49:43.679
Wittgenstein
would spend his nights

49:44.379 --> 49:48.415
having sex with strange men
in parks, right?

49:48.417 --> 49:49.917
And then he would go home

49:49.919 --> 49:51.785
and write about
language's inability

49:51.787 --> 49:54.854
to define things like...
like truth and morality.

49:54.856 --> 49:58.058
And does his behavior make his
arguments any less valid?

49:58.060 --> 50:00.627
Well, no, but couldn't you say

50:00.629 --> 50:05.368
that his theories stem from fear
rather than rational thought?

50:05.700 --> 50:07.002
I don't see how.

50:07.403 --> 50:08.669
I mean, the duty
of the philosophic mind

50:08.671 --> 50:10.136
is to rise above the personal

50:10.138 --> 50:12.439
and contemplate
the universal, right?

50:12.441 --> 50:13.343
Uh...

50:14.910 --> 50:15.812
What?

50:16.678 --> 50:18.714
Forget it.
It's personal, and we agreed.

50:19.515 --> 50:22.085
Well, if it's apropos
of the material, please.

50:22.785 --> 50:23.920
It's about last semester.

50:27.055 --> 50:27.956
Well, make your point.

50:31.060 --> 50:32.459
Oh, thank you.

50:32.461 --> 50:33.863
You're spoiling me.

50:34.796 --> 50:36.065
How do you like it here?

50:36.531 --> 50:39.702
You've been here,
what, four, five years?

50:40.568 --> 50:41.870
Yeah. We... We like it fine.

50:42.705 --> 50:44.107
Uh, it's been five years.

50:46.441 --> 50:47.476
Where'd you move from?

50:47.676 --> 50:50.042
Evanston, outside Chicago.

50:50.044 --> 50:50.946
Mm-hmm.

50:52.647 --> 50:54.781
Hey, there! Look who's here.

50:54.783 --> 50:56.986
It's my junior deputy.

50:59.053 --> 51:00.754
Do you need more help
from Daddy?

51:00.756 --> 51:02.656
H... Honey, we just...

51:02.658 --> 51:03.790
We need some grown-up time.

51:03.792 --> 51:04.794
Can you go play?

51:04.993 --> 51:05.894
Yeah.

51:07.196 --> 51:08.832
Hmm, cute kid.

51:09.164 --> 51:10.065
Adam, right?

51:10.499 --> 51:11.600
No, that's Super Dude.

51:11.966 --> 51:13.135
Big difference.

51:13.702 --> 51:14.935
Puts on a cape,
he's a whole other person.

51:14.937 --> 51:17.607
I need a cape like that.

51:19.475 --> 51:21.444
Gets tiring
being myself all the time.

51:21.776 --> 51:23.479
Well, if I get a chance,
I'll sew you one.

51:25.046 --> 51:26.879
Well,
now you're humoring me.

51:26.881 --> 51:29.649
No. I'm politely waiting for
you to get to the point.

51:29.651 --> 51:33.886
My wife tells me
I'm terrible at small talk.

51:33.888 --> 51:34.890
I think she's right.

51:38.026 --> 51:42.529
I remember the second before,
I thought, "This is wrong.

51:42.531 --> 51:45.735
You're making a mistake.
You're crossing a line."

51:46.769 --> 51:48.071
And so why do it?

51:50.104 --> 51:51.705
I don't know. It's not like

51:51.707 --> 51:54.073
I was satisfying
some curiosity, you know?

51:54.075 --> 51:55.644
I know what it's like to...

52:04.919 --> 52:08.090
Then I read your book,
and it hit me.

52:08.823 --> 52:11.927
People make the most destructive
choices consciously,

52:12.260 --> 52:13.826
and then they try
and rationalize it

52:13.828 --> 52:16.129
with things like,
"I didn't mean it,"

52:16.131 --> 52:18.866
or, "I wasn't thinking,"
or whatever, but it's a lie.

52:18.868 --> 52:20.804
I saw you at the lake
the other day.

52:23.738 --> 52:24.773
Girl's missing.

52:25.240 --> 52:26.809
It's every parent's
worst nightmare.

52:27.276 --> 52:28.511
Yeah.

52:29.778 --> 52:31.013
I've come by
to ask for your help.

52:32.580 --> 52:35.115
Well, how can I help you,
Detective, all things considered?

52:35.117 --> 52:37.854
Because I assume you think
your husband is innocent.

52:38.921 --> 52:40.654
Joyce Bonner is out there,

52:40.656 --> 52:42.592
and if she's still alive,
she's on borrowed time.

52:43.191 --> 52:45.125
If your husband
had nothing to do with that,

52:45.127 --> 52:46.830
I need to know so I can move on.

52:47.129 --> 52:49.263
I've tried to rule him out,
but he won't let me.

52:49.265 --> 52:50.834
I'm sure he's told you
everything he knows.

52:51.165 --> 52:55.071
Mm, I think you're a lot more
convinced of that than I am.

52:55.970 --> 52:58.305
I think that there's
this unknown part of us,

52:58.307 --> 53:00.477
like the id, that...

53:01.943 --> 53:03.245
prefers destruction,

53:04.747 --> 53:05.848
even craves it.

53:06.814 --> 53:08.615
What we call guilt

53:08.617 --> 53:11.553
is just a fear of this
unknown part of our minds.

53:17.626 --> 53:18.528
Evan?

53:19.894 --> 53:21.930
Well, what do you think?
Am I crazy?

53:22.263 --> 53:25.732
Um, sorry. I realized
I just missed my bus.

53:25.734 --> 53:29.038
Um, does your offer still stand?

53:30.238 --> 53:32.171
We found strands of brown hair

53:32.173 --> 53:34.009
in the back seat
of your husband's car.

53:35.678 --> 53:39.048
We matched them with a sample
of Joyce's hairbrush.

53:39.881 --> 53:40.950
It came back positive.

53:43.785 --> 53:45.554
You're the first person
I've told that to.

53:46.321 --> 53:48.156
Not even my partner knows.

53:48.656 --> 53:51.727
And if you can tell me what
that girl was doing in the car,

53:53.328 --> 53:54.796
it doesn't have
to leave this room.

53:59.200 --> 54:01.069
I know why you left Evanston,

54:02.638 --> 54:04.173
the official version, anyway.

54:06.140 --> 54:08.744
College was a little reluctant
to give the details, but...

54:11.046 --> 54:12.080
must have been tough.

54:15.350 --> 54:16.752
How many years you been married?

54:17.086 --> 54:19.187
Oh, 15 years.

54:20.155 --> 54:21.124
Yeah.

54:21.689 --> 54:22.724
All of them smooth?

54:22.992 --> 54:24.026
Oh, hardly.

54:26.694 --> 54:28.932
We both had our reasons
for leaving Evanston,

54:29.397 --> 54:30.332
both of them very different.

54:31.867 --> 54:33.702
Don't think for a second
you know what they were.

54:36.138 --> 54:37.373
Think it's time for you to go.

54:41.243 --> 54:42.578
Well, thank you for your help.

54:43.245 --> 54:44.247
You have a lovely home.

54:45.414 --> 54:47.015
Yeah, I work hard
to keep it that way.

54:50.051 --> 54:51.019
Thank you very much.

54:52.021 --> 54:52.921
Goodbye now.

55:42.705 --> 55:44.270
Oh, she's home.

55:44.272 --> 55:45.772
Oh, I'm sorry. If I'd known,
I would have called her.

55:45.774 --> 55:46.809
I didn't mind.

55:50.245 --> 55:51.347
Thank you for the ride.

55:52.448 --> 55:55.652
Philosophers
are a dying breed, Professor.

55:56.051 --> 55:57.283
There's safety in numbers.

56:09.964 --> 56:10.999
Hello?

56:12.334 --> 56:13.299
Ellen?

56:13.301 --> 56:14.870
Daddy's home!

56:18.006 --> 56:20.143
The policeman
came back today, Daddy.

56:20.374 --> 56:21.943
They came back again, huh?

56:23.144 --> 56:24.046
Hmm.

56:24.379 --> 56:25.281
Hon?

56:26.314 --> 56:27.379
I've been calling you.

56:27.381 --> 56:28.417
Where were you?

56:48.903 --> 56:51.037
Why don't you walk Zelda in?
I'll carry Adam.

56:51.039 --> 56:53.008
I've got it. It's only a finger.

57:03.452 --> 57:04.352
Evan Birch.

57:08.256 --> 57:11.124
- Hair?
- Strands of brown hair in the back seat.

57:11.126 --> 57:12.292
<i>It's a match.</i>

57:12.294 --> 57:13.560
Well, they must have planted it.

57:13.562 --> 57:15.361
Evan, I need you to think.

57:15.363 --> 57:17.229
Is there any way this girl
could have been in your car?

57:17.231 --> 57:18.867
No, not that I know of.

57:21.370 --> 57:22.438
What if you didn't know it?

57:23.104 --> 57:24.470
<i>Did you ever
leave your car open,</i>

57:24.472 --> 57:26.138
- maybe at the lake that day?
- <i>No.</i>

57:26.140 --> 57:27.908
- Pick up any hitchhikers?
- No.

57:27.910 --> 57:30.243
<i>How 'bout at school?
Do you ever give students ride?</i>

57:30.245 --> 57:31.981
I don't socialize
with the students.

57:32.914 --> 57:34.149
<i>That's not what I asked.</i>

57:35.383 --> 57:38.317
Um, I did give a ride to some
high school students one day.

57:38.319 --> 57:40.323
They were doing prep classes
here on campus.

57:41.022 --> 57:42.892
Three girls and a boy.
It was raining.

57:44.193 --> 57:45.528
Was Joyce Bonner one of them?

57:46.194 --> 57:48.363
Maybe. I suppose it's possible.

57:49.531 --> 57:50.800
Do you have attendance records?

57:51.566 --> 57:53.299
Uh, yeah.

57:53.301 --> 57:54.903
I... Look, I'm late for class.

57:55.403 --> 57:58.037
I'll... I'll have a look
and see if she's on there.

57:58.039 --> 57:59.573
It'll be good if she's
on there, right?

57:59.575 --> 58:02.174
Well, on the one hand,
it would explain the hairs.

58:02.176 --> 58:04.276
On the other hand, it would
connect you to a missing girl.

58:04.278 --> 58:06.281
- <i>Look, I'll call you later.</i>
- Yeah, okay.

58:18.459 --> 58:19.528
Where I grew up,

58:20.062 --> 58:22.261
if someone wants to prove
a chair exists,

58:22.263 --> 58:24.867
they hit you over the head
with it.

58:25.633 --> 58:26.899
Yeah.

58:26.901 --> 58:28.069
We're done with your car.

58:30.972 --> 58:32.541
Sign this, it's all yours.

58:36.879 --> 58:38.410
So you can take
my car without asking,

58:38.412 --> 58:40.282
but you need my permission
to give it back?

58:40.915 --> 58:44.250
I don't make the paperwork.
I just fill it out.

58:44.252 --> 58:46.185
I don't suppose you towed it
back to my spot?

58:46.187 --> 58:47.088
No.

58:47.955 --> 58:49.858
You have to pick it up
from the impound,

58:50.292 --> 58:52.127
half an hour up 35.

58:52.660 --> 58:55.261
- I'll give you a lift if you like.
- That's okay.

58:55.263 --> 58:56.899
I'll get it myself, thanks.

59:01.102 --> 59:02.137
Anything else?

59:04.406 --> 59:06.609
You don't think much
about what I do, but...

59:07.975 --> 59:10.879
when you consider it,
we're in the same racket.

59:11.479 --> 59:12.914
What racket is that?

59:13.147 --> 59:15.885
Proof, searching for the truth.

59:17.419 --> 59:22.391
Truth hides behind arguments,
analysis, reasoning.

59:23.225 --> 59:27.359
Well, reason leads us to the truth.
It doesn't conceal it.

59:27.361 --> 59:29.564
I've always argued that
the truth is instinctive.

59:31.365 --> 59:34.035
You take this little problem
here on your board.

59:36.138 --> 59:38.441
The answer seems
pretty plain to me.

59:38.973 --> 59:39.975
Does it?

59:40.876 --> 59:42.345
Well, be my guest.
Prove this chair exists.

59:46.314 --> 59:47.349
What chair?

59:55.490 --> 59:56.622
Where did you go to school?

59:56.624 --> 59:59.361
Oh, bachelor's at Seton Hall.

01:00:00.461 --> 01:00:01.597
JD at Fordham.

01:00:02.464 --> 01:00:03.366
A lawyer?

01:00:04.066 --> 01:00:05.100
Did you practice?

01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:07.969
I did my time
in the DA's office.

01:00:08.236 --> 01:00:09.405
Wasn't my kind of thing.

01:00:10.972 --> 01:00:12.407
They wouldn't let you
carry a gun.

01:00:17.745 --> 01:00:19.381
That's my youngest, Katie.

01:00:20.582 --> 01:00:22.415
She goes to school with Joyce.

01:00:22.417 --> 01:00:23.920
They don't know
each other, though.

01:00:24.752 --> 01:00:27.022
Different circles.

01:00:28.222 --> 01:00:30.189
Well, you know,
we almost put her

01:00:30.191 --> 01:00:32.460
through that summer program
of yours at Addison,

01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:34.296
you know,
the one Joyce went through.

01:00:35.097 --> 01:00:38.298
Who knows?
They may have become friends.

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:39.535
Well, it's a large program.

01:00:40.234 --> 01:00:41.937
Not everybody
knows everybody else.

01:00:42.437 --> 01:00:44.607
Including the teachers
and the... the students?

01:00:45.539 --> 01:00:47.540
Are you questioning me
outside counsel, Detective?

01:00:47.542 --> 01:00:49.109
Oh, no, I wouldn't dream of it.

01:00:49.111 --> 01:00:51.310
No, I just want to know
that, you know,

01:00:51.312 --> 01:00:54.247
if Katie had gone there, would she have
gotten to know all her professors?

01:00:54.249 --> 01:00:56.082
Uh, not necessarily.

01:00:56.084 --> 01:00:57.986
The students are limited
to three classes,

01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:00.489
and there are 15 instructors.

01:01:01.323 --> 01:01:03.256
That's not to say
contact's unimaginable.

01:01:03.258 --> 01:01:05.361
Really? In what way?

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:10.029
Well, one could imagine
Katie, for example,

01:01:10.031 --> 01:01:14.437
being caught in a rainstorm,
uh, with a few friends,

01:01:15.269 --> 01:01:16.636
two other girls and a boy,

01:01:16.638 --> 01:01:20.173
and perhaps a, uh,
professor offers them

01:01:20.175 --> 01:01:23.078
a ride from the library
to the student union,

01:01:23.412 --> 01:01:26.649
and, uh, perhaps while Katie's
in the back of the car, she...

01:01:27.115 --> 01:01:31.383
she fixes up her makeup and... and maybe
brushes back some of her wet hair...

01:01:31.385 --> 01:01:33.819
- Mm-hmm.
- inadvertently leaving a strand or two

01:01:33.821 --> 01:01:37.459
in the professor's
notoriously unkempt car.

01:01:38.225 --> 01:01:40.727
Would that qualify
as getting to know somebody?

01:01:40.729 --> 01:01:41.761
No, I don't think it would,

01:01:41.763 --> 01:01:43.830
but if I read her diary

01:01:43.832 --> 01:01:46.366
and it mentioned an older man
she'd met that summer,

01:01:46.368 --> 01:01:49.672
I'd want to have words with every
guy she so much as bumped into.

01:01:50.571 --> 01:01:52.705
You read
your daughter's diary?

01:01:52.707 --> 01:01:54.010
Every page.

01:01:56.812 --> 01:02:00.683
Before I forget,
I found these in your glove box.

01:02:01.182 --> 01:02:02.784
I wanted to make sure
you got them back.

01:02:04.553 --> 01:02:05.484
What is it?

01:02:05.486 --> 01:02:06.488
You tell me.

01:02:09.758 --> 01:02:12.325
I suppose you think
I met Joyce Bonner

01:02:12.327 --> 01:02:14.526
at the Sanders Hotel
fountain at 7:00?

01:02:14.528 --> 01:02:16.731
No. The Sanders is in Chicago.

01:02:17.332 --> 01:02:20.102
Was, anyway. Closed down
about four years ago.

01:02:21.202 --> 01:02:23.104
That would have made Joyce 13,

01:02:25.106 --> 01:02:26.508
and I don't think
you're that kind of guy.

01:02:27.475 --> 01:02:29.475
I mean, at first,
I thought it was garbage,

01:02:29.477 --> 01:02:30.676
but then you bought this car

01:02:30.678 --> 01:02:32.544
here about three years ago,

01:02:32.546 --> 01:02:34.346
and I know you don't smoke,

01:02:34.348 --> 01:02:36.216
so I just figured
you were holding on to them

01:02:36.218 --> 01:02:37.783
for sentimental reasons.

01:02:37.785 --> 01:02:40.488
Shouldn't this be in one
of your fancy evidence bags?

01:02:41.356 --> 01:02:42.258
Should it?

01:02:43.658 --> 01:02:44.727
Whose writing is it?

01:02:45.127 --> 01:02:45.892
I have no idea.

01:02:45.894 --> 01:02:46.892
Is it your wife's?

01:02:46.894 --> 01:02:48.129
No, it's not.

01:02:48.497 --> 01:02:49.632
It doesn't appear to be.

01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:51.700
- Would you slow down?
- It looks feminine,

01:02:53.568 --> 01:02:58.506
the way the letters
are all round, almost touching.

01:02:59.874 --> 01:03:03.411
You know, when a guy
goes through AA,

01:03:03.678 --> 01:03:05.448
he carries a coin
around with him,

01:03:05.914 --> 01:03:07.415
reminds him not to drink.

01:03:08.716 --> 01:03:10.183
Seems pretty natural,

01:03:10.185 --> 01:03:11.320
the way you're
fiddling with those.

01:03:11.586 --> 01:03:13.321
Could you stop
the goddamn car?

01:03:24.533 --> 01:03:26.368
You have to know
where this is headed.

01:03:30.138 --> 01:03:31.674
Would you take me
to my car, please?

01:03:36.912 --> 01:03:38.147
Hey, Frank!

01:03:42.283 --> 01:03:43.184
Here you go.

01:03:43.919 --> 01:03:45.354
Three-five-six-seven.

01:03:47.222 --> 01:03:48.256
He'll take care of you.

01:04:25.727 --> 01:04:28.962
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

01:04:28.964 --> 01:04:32.401
The impound may as well have
been across the state line.

01:04:36.338 --> 01:04:37.839
Can we not talk about that now?

01:04:44.278 --> 01:04:45.313
Mmm.

01:04:48.883 --> 01:04:50.419
Mm, peaches.

01:04:51.285 --> 01:04:52.421
Perfect Peaches.

01:04:55.522 --> 01:04:56.425
What?

01:04:57.725 --> 01:04:59.227
Just looking at your face.

01:05:01.328 --> 01:05:02.231
Why?

01:05:04.332 --> 01:05:06.969
Can't one look at another's face
without having an agenda?

01:05:09.004 --> 01:05:11.640
One can, but I have the feeling
that one isn't.

01:05:18.379 --> 01:05:19.881
I want you
to tell me the truth.

01:05:20.981 --> 01:05:21.983
The truth about what?

01:05:22.716 --> 01:05:24.220
What was she doing
in your car?

01:05:26.321 --> 01:05:27.687
Who?

01:05:27.689 --> 01:05:29.225
What? Did you think
I wouldn't find out

01:05:29.490 --> 01:05:30.992
that they have evidence
of a missing girl in your car?

01:05:32.394 --> 01:05:34.660
I didn't want to worry you
any more than you already were.

01:05:34.662 --> 01:05:36.696
So you kept a secret, <i>secret</i> ?

01:05:36.698 --> 01:05:38.400
- No.
- From your wife?

01:05:38.932 --> 01:05:41.436
This is her lip gloss, Evan.
Zelda found it.

01:05:42.437 --> 01:05:43.906
What was she doing in your car?

01:05:44.638 --> 01:05:46.673
I could explain this to you,

01:05:46.675 --> 01:05:48.707
but I have a feeling it may be too
pat for your taste right now.

01:05:48.709 --> 01:05:50.075
Oh, don't make this about me.

01:05:50.077 --> 01:05:51.546
I think this is about you,
Ellen.

01:05:52.546 --> 01:05:54.013
You used to be
so rational, you know?

01:05:54.015 --> 01:05:55.915
Things were either
proven or unproven,

01:05:55.917 --> 01:05:59.888
and now you're all intuition
and conjecture and paranoia.

01:06:03.857 --> 01:06:04.959
Did that cop tell you?

01:06:06.593 --> 01:06:08.263
Is that what you were
talking about the other day?

01:06:09.631 --> 01:06:11.867
Oh, this is just great. Did he
ask you to wear a wire as well?

01:06:12.667 --> 01:06:15.971
I'm trying my hardest
to trust you again.

01:06:19.707 --> 01:06:20.742
You don't trust me now?

01:06:21.575 --> 01:06:23.044
I haven't trusted you
for five years.

01:06:23.845 --> 01:06:26.578
Okay. I'm gonna
save you the anxiety

01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:28.383
of having to sleep
next to me tonight.

01:06:47.368 --> 01:06:48.437
- Hello?
- <i>They found her.</i>

01:06:48.736 --> 01:06:50.803
- <i>What?</i>
- Jesus, Evan,

01:06:50.805 --> 01:06:53.372
I've been trying you all morning.
Fisherman found her.

01:06:53.374 --> 01:06:55.510
<i>Source inside the police told
me she was floating by the dam.</i>

01:06:55.877 --> 01:06:57.743
What does that mean?

01:06:57.745 --> 01:06:59.479
It means you don't
say shit to anybody,

01:06:59.481 --> 01:07:00.948
not without talking to me first.

01:07:01.482 --> 01:07:04.319
Autopsy's coming. Then they'll
decide whether to file charges.

01:07:04.885 --> 01:07:06.586
<i>I'll be in touch
when I hear more.</i>

01:07:06.588 --> 01:07:08.421
<i>Until then, act normal.</i>

01:07:08.423 --> 01:07:09.325
Act normal?

01:07:09.923 --> 01:07:10.892
Guilty men hide.

01:07:11.526 --> 01:07:12.528
Gotta run.

01:07:18.533 --> 01:07:19.765
Professor Birch.

01:07:19.767 --> 01:07:21.667
Professor Birch.
Professor Birch,

01:07:21.669 --> 01:07:23.669
if we could have a moment
of your time, sir.

01:07:23.671 --> 01:07:25.571
Professor Birch, if we could just
have one moment of your time.

01:07:25.573 --> 01:07:26.973
Do you have a statement, sir?

01:07:26.975 --> 01:07:28.573
- Dr. Birch.
- I have a few questions.

01:07:28.575 --> 01:07:29.875
- Professor. Professor.
- Professor Birch.

01:07:46.827 --> 01:07:49.564
Well, nothing like the hint of a
scandal to bring out an audience.

01:07:53.801 --> 01:07:55.136
So many budding philosophers.

01:07:56.838 --> 01:07:58.106
We haven't a moment to waste.

01:08:03.577 --> 01:08:04.979
Why the hell didn't you tell me
about this?

01:08:05.446 --> 01:08:06.948
There was nothing to tell.
I mean,

01:08:07.548 --> 01:08:09.682
it seems I was at the lake the
day the girl disappeared,

01:08:09.684 --> 01:08:11.486
and the police
have questioned me about it.

01:08:11.785 --> 01:08:13.421
Because you might have
seen something?

01:08:14.022 --> 01:08:15.591
There may be
other connections, too.

01:08:16.723 --> 01:08:18.060
Such as?

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:20.126
Well, she was enrolled
in a summer program here,

01:08:20.127 --> 01:08:21.928
and I may or may not have
given her a ride one day

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:23.929
with some other students.

01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:25.531
- It was raining.
- Evan, how worried should I be about this?

01:08:25.533 --> 01:08:26.568
Why? Did you give her
a ride, too?

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:30.469
You're a member
of this faculty.

01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:32.505
Anything that threatens
your reputation

01:08:32.506 --> 01:08:34.040
threatens
the university's reputation.

01:08:34.042 --> 01:08:35.774
- I know.
- Which means I get to hear about it

01:08:35.776 --> 01:08:37.510
- before the goddamn press.
- Okay.

01:08:37.511 --> 01:08:39.978
<i>The Chronicle</i> called
asking for a quote.

01:08:39.979 --> 01:08:41.714
I sounded like an imbecile.

01:08:41.716 --> 01:08:43.017
Why? What did you say?

01:08:43.952 --> 01:08:46.818
That I had the utmost confidence
in my faculty

01:08:46.819 --> 01:08:49.689
and I am certain the police
will rule out Dr. Birch

01:08:49.923 --> 01:08:51.624
as a suspect in this case.

01:08:51.626 --> 01:08:52.727
- Okay, great.
- Evan,

01:08:53.928 --> 01:08:55.897
- is that gonna come back and haunt me?
- No, it's not, Bob.

01:08:57.131 --> 01:08:58.898
Look, I'm behind you,

01:08:58.899 --> 01:09:00.868
but I'm pulling you
from classes immediately.

01:09:02.502 --> 01:09:05.737
You... I just gave a lecture
to a standing-room-only crowd.

01:09:05.738 --> 01:09:08.241
Listen to yourself. They weren't
there for your lecture.

01:09:08.243 --> 01:09:10.542
- You can work out of your office,
- My work, my commitment...

01:09:10.544 --> 01:09:12.277
...but no more classes
until further notice.

01:09:12.279 --> 01:09:13.781
- ...to this university is second to none.
- Evan!

01:09:14.982 --> 01:09:16.051
It's already done.

01:09:27.995 --> 01:09:30.062
Adam, can you be
a big ghost, honey,

01:09:30.064 --> 01:09:31.566
and buckle yourself in?

01:09:34.801 --> 01:09:36.604
Hey, honey, um...

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.139
you remember that day

01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:41.542
Daddy was late to pick you up
from camp?

01:09:42.743 --> 01:09:44.613
Do you remember, like,

01:09:45.145 --> 01:09:49.250
anything that he said
or why he was late?

01:09:52.854 --> 01:09:54.756
Oh, hey, buddy.
You get a costume?

01:09:55.056 --> 01:09:56.988
- Yes, it's perfect.
- Ah, look at that.

01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:58.189
What about you?

01:09:58.191 --> 01:09:59.627
- I didn't want one.
- Oh.

01:10:00.762 --> 01:10:02.264
Why didn't you call me?
I would have joined you.

01:10:03.730 --> 01:10:04.732
They found her.

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.202
Yeah. Paul told me.

01:10:07.936 --> 01:10:09.538
Wait. That's all
you have to say?

01:10:10.571 --> 01:10:11.707
What do you want me to say?

01:10:12.774 --> 01:10:14.139
They're gonna let me know
if they want to charge me

01:10:14.141 --> 01:10:15.510
after the autopsy comes in.

01:10:48.208 --> 01:10:49.110
Yes.

01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:55.150
And you said
that was a gray Volkswagen.

01:10:56.150 --> 01:10:57.653
And what time was
that?

01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:04.693
Okay.

01:11:08.629 --> 01:11:09.330
All right.

01:11:10.897 --> 01:11:11.800
Thank you.

01:11:20.141 --> 01:11:21.777
Oh, look
at the skeletons.

01:11:23.244 --> 01:11:25.310
Why does that invisible man
wear a Band-Aid?

01:11:25.312 --> 01:11:26.347
Did he get hurt?

01:11:26.847 --> 01:11:28.714
Well, it's a bandage,
not a Band-Aid,

01:11:28.716 --> 01:11:30.919
and he wears them
so that he can be seen.

01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:49.738
Candy apples!

01:11:52.039 --> 01:11:53.304
Could I have this one, Daddy?

01:11:53.306 --> 01:11:54.342
- Hey, John.
- Hi.

01:11:54.775 --> 01:11:55.840
Me under here.

01:11:55.842 --> 01:11:56.908
Which one do you want?

01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:57.945
One with sprinkles?

01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:00.045
Okay. Let's have one
with sprinkles,

01:12:00.047 --> 01:12:01.346
- and we'll have two with nuts.
- Okay.

01:12:01.348 --> 01:12:02.751
Uh, do you want nuts
on yours, Zelda?

01:12:03.051 --> 01:12:03.952
Zelda?

01:12:04.918 --> 01:12:06.087
Where'd she go? Zelda?

01:12:09.089 --> 01:12:09.992
Zelda?

01:12:10.691 --> 01:12:11.693
Zelda!

01:12:11.993 --> 01:12:13.358
Adam, will you
stay here with John?

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:14.460
- Will you keep an eye on Adam?
- Sure.

01:12:14.462 --> 01:12:17.866
Zelda! Zelda!

01:12:19.199 --> 01:12:21.102
Zelda, what are you doing?

01:12:25.205 --> 01:12:27.273
Will you stop that girl?

01:12:27.275 --> 01:12:29.411
- Hey, whoa, whoa! Where's the fire?
- Watch where you're going!

01:12:30.011 --> 01:12:31.710
What the hell are you thinking?

01:12:31.712 --> 01:12:32.813
- Just a second, sir.
- This is my daughter.

01:12:35.248 --> 01:12:37.051
Is that true?
Is this your father?

01:12:37.385 --> 01:12:38.349
No.

01:12:38.351 --> 01:12:39.785
Zelda Frances Birch!

01:12:39.787 --> 01:12:40.819
Settle down, sir.

01:12:40.821 --> 01:12:42.287
I will not settle down.

01:12:42.289 --> 01:12:43.889
I... This is my daughter.
I am taking her home.

01:12:43.891 --> 01:12:45.090
She's in a lot of trouble.

01:12:45.092 --> 01:12:46.927
Sir, I need you to step back.

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:48.262
Is that clear?

01:12:51.466 --> 01:12:52.430
Zelda?

01:12:52.432 --> 01:12:53.668
That's your name?

01:12:54.368 --> 01:12:55.404
Okay, Zelda,

01:12:56.037 --> 01:12:57.338
I want you to tell me the truth.

01:12:58.306 --> 01:12:59.374
Is that your father?

01:13:04.111 --> 01:13:05.247
I need to see your ID, sir.

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.715
This is unbelievable.

01:13:13.887 --> 01:13:15.056
I... I don't have my ID.

01:13:31.873 --> 01:13:33.475
Okay, in you go.

01:13:34.242 --> 01:13:35.243
Up you go.

01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:37.044
Help him put his belt on.

01:13:40.213 --> 01:13:41.346
There you go, sir.

01:13:41.348 --> 01:13:42.818
Sorry for the confusion.

01:13:43.083 --> 01:13:44.884
You can't be
too careful these days.

01:13:44.886 --> 01:13:46.388
- Is that what you call this?
- Oh, come on, Evan.

01:13:53.293 --> 01:13:54.796
I've got all night,
young lady.

01:13:57.198 --> 01:13:59.066
A shrug's not gonna cut it,
I'm afraid.

01:14:00.034 --> 01:14:01.069
I'm sorry.

01:14:06.973 --> 01:14:09.010
You've hardly said two words
to me all week, Zelda.

01:14:11.279 --> 01:14:13.045
I know everything's
a little crazy at the moment.

01:14:13.047 --> 01:14:14.149
Is that what's bothering you?

01:14:15.115 --> 01:14:16.048
No.

01:14:16.050 --> 01:14:16.985
Well, what is it?

01:14:18.019 --> 01:14:19.053
Promise you won't tell Mommy?

01:14:20.221 --> 01:14:22.223
Your mommy and I don't keep
secrets from each other,

01:14:22.923 --> 01:14:24.355
okay? But if you tell me
what it is,

01:14:24.357 --> 01:14:25.494
I'll decide
if she needs to know.

01:14:27.895 --> 01:14:29.263
She asked me about that day

01:14:30.198 --> 01:14:33.068
you picked me up from camp,
when you were late.

01:14:36.570 --> 01:14:39.304
Z, I need you to be
honest with me,

01:14:39.306 --> 01:14:40.508
okay? Completely honest.

01:14:41.609 --> 01:14:43.341
Do you think
I had something to do

01:14:43.343 --> 01:14:44.879
with what happened to that girl?

01:14:48.082 --> 01:14:48.984
No.

01:14:49.217 --> 01:14:51.186
Oh, good, because I didn't.

01:14:52.153 --> 01:14:52.988
You know me.

01:14:57.057 --> 01:14:58.159
I wouldn't hurt a fly.

01:15:34.028 --> 01:15:35.262
Autopsy just came in.

01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:54.679
Yeah.

01:15:57.517 --> 01:15:58.419
Okay.

01:16:02.489 --> 01:16:03.390
Thank you.

01:16:15.269 --> 01:16:16.635
Is Evan Birch home?

01:16:16.637 --> 01:16:18.039
It's Detective Malloy.

01:16:18.338 --> 01:16:20.975
They had an event tonight
at the university.

01:16:29.182 --> 01:16:30.683
All right, let's do it.

01:16:30.685 --> 01:16:33.120
It's only a faculty party.
It'll be fine.

01:16:34.989 --> 01:16:36.458
We should figure out
what we're gonna say.

01:16:37.992 --> 01:16:38.927
Well, just the truth.

01:16:39.827 --> 01:16:41.593
It's outrageous
we're being strung along,

01:16:41.595 --> 01:16:44.132
and hopefully everything
will be cleared up soon.

01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:51.105
We're hanging in there.

01:16:52.739 --> 01:16:55.107
It's outrageous how
we've been strung along,

01:16:55.109 --> 01:16:58.245
but everything
will be cleared up soon.

01:16:59.346 --> 01:17:00.381
Let's hope so.

01:17:01.248 --> 01:17:02.747
Situations like this

01:17:02.749 --> 01:17:04.919
tend to show our real selves,
you know?

01:17:05.418 --> 01:17:07.486
I'll have a Chardonnay
and a scotch and soda.

01:17:07.488 --> 01:17:10.057
And actually, I'll have one for the road.
Double, neat.

01:17:11.092 --> 01:17:12.694
It's criminal, what they're
putting you through.

01:17:13.127 --> 01:17:14.162
You can sue, you know.

01:17:14.427 --> 01:17:15.693
One battle at a time.

01:17:15.695 --> 01:17:17.295
I think the most important thing

01:17:17.297 --> 01:17:19.066
is we gotta get Evan
back in the classroom.

01:17:20.133 --> 01:17:21.168
What do you mean?

01:17:22.168 --> 01:17:23.070
Here you are.

01:17:24.171 --> 01:17:25.440
They pulled you from classes?

01:17:27.307 --> 01:17:29.144
I think I spoke
out of turn, buddy.

01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:30.675
Sorry.

01:17:30.677 --> 01:17:32.713
- Until when?
- Uh, spring.

01:17:33.114 --> 01:17:35.380
The... The second coming.
Who knows?

01:17:35.382 --> 01:17:37.184
Hey, Barbara.
You look fantastic.

01:17:38.119 --> 01:17:39.417
Can I talk to you for a second?

01:17:39.419 --> 01:17:41.088
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

01:17:48.428 --> 01:17:49.463
You having fun yet?

01:17:49.763 --> 01:17:51.231
When were you
planning on telling me?

01:17:51.664 --> 01:17:53.631
Oh, wipe that stupid smirk
off your face.

01:17:53.633 --> 01:17:55.235
What? What?

01:17:55.436 --> 01:17:57.236
When did this happen?
Why didn't you tell me?

01:17:57.238 --> 01:17:59.470
Frankly, I think it's
the least of our problems.

01:17:59.472 --> 01:18:00.671
You think our livelihood

01:18:00.673 --> 01:18:02.374
is the least of our problems?

01:18:02.376 --> 01:18:04.175
Listen, listen, let's just
finish our time here,

01:18:04.177 --> 01:18:06.411
and I promise we can fight
about this when we get home.

01:18:06.413 --> 01:18:07.648
No. I'm going home now.

01:18:08.582 --> 01:18:11.519
Why? So you can finish
interrogating Zelda?

01:18:12.586 --> 01:18:14.719
- Interrogating?
- Well, what else would you call it?

01:18:14.721 --> 01:18:16.457
Has that cop deputized you yet?

01:18:17.091 --> 01:18:18.590
- Ellen.
- Let go!

01:18:18.592 --> 01:18:20.658
Ellen, listen. Just relax.

01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:22.294
Have a drink.

01:18:22.296 --> 01:18:24.129
- Sit down, please.
- Why? To give everyone

01:18:24.131 --> 01:18:26.098
- a better chance to gawk at us?
- No.

01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:28.099
It's outrageous how they're
stringing us along...

01:18:28.101 --> 01:18:30.469
- Ellen.
- but everything's gonna be cleared up soon!

01:18:30.471 --> 01:18:32.737
Do you hear
how ridiculous that sounds?

01:18:32.739 --> 01:18:34.273
I hear how ridiculous you sound.

01:18:34.275 --> 01:18:35.674
Will you please calm down?

01:18:35.676 --> 01:18:37.544
I'm sick of being calm!

01:18:42.516 --> 01:18:43.785
Under a bit of pressure lately.

01:18:47.754 --> 01:18:48.655
Ellen!

01:18:50.391 --> 01:18:51.689
What's gotten into you?

01:18:51.691 --> 01:18:53.060
- What's gotten into me?
- Yeah.

01:18:53.561 --> 01:18:55.294
Just go back in there,

01:18:55.296 --> 01:18:56.828
and peddle whatever
jolly bullshit you want, Evan.

01:18:56.830 --> 01:18:58.429
I'm going home.

01:18:58.431 --> 01:18:59.531
All right, so that's it?
Things get tough,

01:18:59.533 --> 01:19:00.568
and you just leave?

01:19:01.534 --> 01:19:03.268
Whatever happened
to for better or worse?

01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:04.836
Oh,

01:19:04.838 --> 01:19:07.775
you're gonna lecture me
on keeping promises?

01:19:08.542 --> 01:19:09.577
What's that?

01:19:09.776 --> 01:19:11.712
I found it, in your desk.

01:19:12.178 --> 01:19:13.080
Who wrote it?

01:19:14.748 --> 01:19:17.782
You found it,
as in it magically appeared,

01:19:17.784 --> 01:19:19.617
or you went looking
through my desk?

01:19:19.619 --> 01:19:21.353
Oh, no, no, no.
I searched your desk.

01:19:21.355 --> 01:19:24.122
I searched the whole,
entire house. Who wrote it?

01:19:24.124 --> 01:19:25.890
What have I ever done
that's made you so distrustful?

01:19:25.892 --> 01:19:27.492
- What have you done?
- Yeah.

01:19:27.494 --> 01:19:28.729
You know exactly
what you've done!

01:19:29.896 --> 01:19:31.565
Evanston? Really?

01:19:32.365 --> 01:19:34.800
God, for the millionth time,
nothing happened.

01:19:34.802 --> 01:19:37.236
Well, I saw you! I saw you
fucking in your office!

01:19:37.238 --> 01:19:39.106
I never fucked her
in my office!

01:19:46.212 --> 01:19:47.614
You know what
you don't understand?

01:19:49.816 --> 01:19:53.285
I don't even care
that you did it anymore.

01:19:53.287 --> 01:19:54.189
I don't,

01:19:55.890 --> 01:19:57.158
but it's the lie.

01:19:58.626 --> 01:19:59.793
You've been telling me,

01:20:01.061 --> 01:20:03.728
you've been telling yourself nothing
happened for so many years,

01:20:03.730 --> 01:20:05.300
I think you actually believe it.

01:20:07.767 --> 01:20:11.738
And I'm terrified about what else
you could convince yourself of.

01:21:21.242 --> 01:21:22.177
Press okay.

01:21:38.324 --> 01:21:41.762
<i>...not like
I was satisfying some curiosit.</i>

01:22:13.427 --> 01:22:14.996
- Can I have a scotch?
- You got it.

01:22:44.557 --> 01:22:45.859
Have you got
a telephone I can use?

01:23:00.007 --> 01:23:01.776
Detective Malloy, please.

01:23:02.109 --> 01:23:03.845
I'd like to report a crime.

01:23:06.446 --> 01:23:07.914
Mm-hmm.

01:23:09.449 --> 01:23:10.350
Can we talk?

01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:14.721
Sure.

01:23:15.489 --> 01:23:16.391
Come on in.

01:23:17.925 --> 01:23:18.860
Alone?

01:23:30.503 --> 01:23:31.439
Long night?

01:23:32.573 --> 01:23:33.638
Yeah.

01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:34.709
How 'bout some coffee?

01:23:38.544 --> 01:23:39.446
What did you do there?

01:23:40.381 --> 01:23:41.082
Uh...

01:23:47.687 --> 01:23:49.423
You're a tough man
to track down.

01:23:53.494 --> 01:23:54.395
Where have you been?

01:24:08.775 --> 01:24:11.111
Do you have trouble remembering
things sometimes, Detective?

01:24:11.512 --> 01:24:13.648
People and places, sequences?

01:24:14.515 --> 01:24:15.813
I've read
a lot of studies on it.

01:24:15.815 --> 01:24:18.952
It's, uh, it's fascinating.

01:24:20.587 --> 01:24:25.892
You know, m... memory is really the
least reliable function of our brain.

01:24:26.493 --> 01:24:30.530
I mean, it's reliable in that it
reinforces one's concept of self,

01:24:31.964 --> 01:24:33.532
as opposed to providing

01:24:33.534 --> 01:24:38.906
an... an accurate account
of past events.

01:24:39.873 --> 01:24:41.173
Is this gonna be on the test?

01:24:51.985 --> 01:24:56.591
I had a student once
when I was at Evanston,

01:24:57.190 --> 01:25:00.461
Carol. We, um...

01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:02.661
- we had an affair.
- Mm-hmm.

01:25:02.663 --> 01:25:06.667
Her parents threatened
to sue the university, I think.

01:25:07.801 --> 01:25:11.806
Ellen was pregnant, and, uh, I
resigned, and we moved here.

01:25:15.609 --> 01:25:19.847
But I also remember
that nothing happened.

01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:22.182
She tried to kiss me.

01:25:23.217 --> 01:25:25.617
I said no, and she got angry,

01:25:25.619 --> 01:25:27.551
and she told her parents
that we slept together anyway,

01:25:27.553 --> 01:25:29.589
and that's... that's why
we had to leave.

01:25:29.922 --> 01:25:32.059
But I don't remember
which one actually happened.

01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:34.061
I can't prove either,

01:25:34.861 --> 01:25:37.696
and, uh,
and without proof I'm...

01:25:52.145 --> 01:25:53.080
I migh...

01:25:55.114 --> 01:25:56.684
I might have killed that girl.

01:25:59.686 --> 01:26:02.490
I saw her that day at the lake.

01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:07.627
<i>I... I went over to... to see he.</i>

01:26:12.132 --> 01:26:14.769
<i>She... She remembered
me from, uh,</i>

01:26:15.636 --> 01:26:17.868
<i>from a... a ride
I'd given her once,</i>

01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:19.737
and, uh, she knew
a lot about me.

01:26:19.739 --> 01:26:21.141
She'd read my book.

01:26:23.610 --> 01:26:24.645
<i>She had a crush on me.</i>

01:26:25.311 --> 01:26:27.545
She asked if I wanted
to take a walk.

01:26:27.547 --> 01:26:29.684
She knew an old trail
around the dam.

01:26:30.284 --> 01:26:32.053
<i>I said, "Yeah, that'd be nice."</i>

01:26:38.992 --> 01:26:40.494
<i>We were alone.</i>

01:26:40.793 --> 01:26:42.497
<i>It was quiet.
The view was beautiful.</i>

01:26:44.730 --> 01:26:46.730
<i>No one had looked at me
like that in a long time.</i>

01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:08.719
<i>Things
got a little heated.</i>

01:27:08.721 --> 01:27:09.756
And...

01:27:12.926 --> 01:27:14.695
I tried to hold her arms...

01:27:15.695 --> 01:27:18.265
so she couldn't move,
j... just to keep control.

01:27:18.966 --> 01:27:21.800
I mean, she...
she tried to push me,

01:27:21.802 --> 01:27:22.934
<i>and she ran.</i>

01:27:22.936 --> 01:27:24.539
<i>I chased after her. I...</i>

01:27:24.937 --> 01:27:26.673
<i>I didn't want her
to get the wrong idea.</i>

01:27:28.874 --> 01:27:30.241
<i>She lost her footing.</i>

01:27:30.243 --> 01:27:31.876
She... She fell

01:27:31.878 --> 01:27:33.812
and hit her head.
I panicked. I...

01:27:33.814 --> 01:27:37.151
I didn't know what to do,
and I pushed her in.

01:27:39.986 --> 01:27:41.254
I mean, it wasn't on purpose.

01:27:42.055 --> 01:27:44.025
- None of this was... was on purpose.
- Evan!

01:27:46.059 --> 01:27:49.029
The washrooms are around the corner
if you want to splash your face.

01:27:51.698 --> 01:27:52.767
Am I under arrest?

01:27:53.667 --> 01:27:54.569
No.

01:27:58.904 --> 01:27:59.940
Read that.

01:28:03.776 --> 01:28:05.279
It's the final autopsy report.

01:28:05.945 --> 01:28:07.347
You didn't kill Joyce Bonner.

01:28:08.214 --> 01:28:10.584
She fell off a cliff on the
opposite side of the lake.

01:28:11.851 --> 01:28:12.919
It was an accident.

01:28:13.186 --> 01:28:14.919
And she wasn't found
by the dam.

01:28:14.921 --> 01:28:16.958
That was misinformation
we leaked.

01:28:17.391 --> 01:28:19.860
The autopsy shows
she broke both her wrists,

01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:23.064
probably from trying
to slow her fall.

01:28:23.864 --> 01:28:24.899
Her neck was broken.

01:28:25.164 --> 01:28:26.367
The fall killed her instantly.

01:28:28.001 --> 01:28:29.869
That's why we were trying
to get you in here.

01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:32.370
I d... I don't understand.

01:28:32.372 --> 01:28:34.675
- I just confessed to you...
- The case is closed.

01:28:34.908 --> 01:28:36.276
She never hit her head
on a rock.

01:28:37.110 --> 01:28:40.178
There's no evidence of any
intercourse or a struggle,

01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:41.912
no skin under her fingernails,

01:28:41.914 --> 01:28:43.782
no bruises
where you grabbed her.

01:28:43.784 --> 01:28:44.919
I could go on.

01:28:45.252 --> 01:28:47.120
I'm sitting here telling you
that I killed her.

01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:49.123
Can you prove it?

01:28:50.123 --> 01:28:52.026
Because I sure as hell
haven't been able to.

01:28:53.392 --> 01:28:55.096
<i>I know you were there that day.</i>

01:28:57.698 --> 01:28:58.999
<i>I know she was in your car,</i>

01:29:00.033 --> 01:29:02.102
and I know about your history
with students...

01:29:03.936 --> 01:29:05.372
but humans leave traces,

01:29:06.707 --> 01:29:08.005
fibers from clothing,

01:29:08.007 --> 01:29:09.709
skin fragments, footprints,

01:29:09.976 --> 01:29:11.943
and there's no trace of you

01:29:11.945 --> 01:29:14.315
<i>beyond the scribblings
I found in the trash can.</i>

01:29:15.147 --> 01:29:17.182
<i>There's no proof
you did anything more</i>

01:29:17.184 --> 01:29:18.819
<i>than you told me from the star,</i>

01:29:20.287 --> 01:29:21.920
<i>lose track of time</i>

01:29:21.922 --> 01:29:23.223
<i>on your way to pick up
your daughter.</i>

01:29:24.324 --> 01:29:27.028
<i>There's no proof you
even saw Joyce Bonner,</i>

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:29.696
and without proof...

01:29:37.104 --> 01:29:39.269
The department thanks you
for your cooperation

01:29:39.271 --> 01:29:42.741
and, uh, apologizes
for any inconveniences.

01:29:42.743 --> 01:29:44.879
I'll have a patrolman
drive you home.

01:29:45.846 --> 01:29:46.877
You're letting me go?

01:29:46.879 --> 01:29:47.981
Look, I'm not a priest.

01:29:49.016 --> 01:29:50.915
You want to screw college girls
in the woods,

01:29:50.917 --> 01:29:52.951
go ahead. You're not the first,
and you won't be the last,

01:29:52.953 --> 01:29:55.356
but don't look to me
for absolution or forgiveness.

01:29:55.821 --> 01:29:56.757
I'm no shrink.

01:29:57.390 --> 01:29:58.292
I'm like you,

01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:01.162
someone who looks for proof.

01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:07.901
And when I find it,

01:30:08.936 --> 01:30:11.338
I sure as hell
hold on to it tighter than you.

01:30:20.212 --> 01:30:23.283
Let him sleep it off,
and then drive Mr. Birch home.

01:30:24.918 --> 01:30:26.087
His family is waiting.

01:30:52.244 --> 01:30:53.314
I could use a drink.

01:31:20.472 --> 01:31:22.105
Daddy's home!

01:31:22.107 --> 01:31:24.311
Ah, hey, babies. Oh.

01:31:24.878 --> 01:31:25.980
We caught him, Daddy!

01:31:26.279 --> 01:31:27.314
You caught who?

01:31:29.548 --> 01:31:30.915
His name is Herbie.

01:31:30.917 --> 01:31:32.386
Can we keep him, Daddy? Please?

01:31:32.918 --> 01:31:34.352
We'll keep him
in Jinx's old cage,

01:31:34.354 --> 01:31:36.390
and I'll take care
of him. I promise.

01:31:37.190 --> 01:31:38.325
What does Mommy say?

01:31:38.859 --> 01:31:40.561
I said we needed to make
the decision together.

01:31:41.328 --> 01:31:42.960
Why don't you take him upstairs,

01:31:42.962 --> 01:31:44.264
and we'll talk about it.

01:31:59.212 --> 01:32:02.145
They, uh...
They've closed the case.

01:32:02.147 --> 01:32:05.218
It was a... It was an accident.

01:32:06.186 --> 01:32:07.251
She fell.

01:32:07.253 --> 01:32:08.354
It's... It's all over.

01:32:09.388 --> 01:32:10.290
What?

01:32:12.958 --> 01:32:13.961
Why aren't you happy?

01:32:14.962 --> 01:32:17.298
Well, what Malloy thought
never worried me.

01:32:22.936 --> 01:32:23.971
What happened to your hand?

01:32:25.337 --> 01:32:27.471
Ah, it was stupid.

01:32:27.473 --> 01:32:29.510
I... I got drunk, and...

01:32:34.346 --> 01:32:36.950
I would understand
if you wanna leave.

01:32:38.217 --> 01:32:40.287
Well, that's no great feat
of understanding.

01:32:40.552 --> 01:32:43.223
Ah, Ellen, please, I'm...
I'm trying to apologize.

01:32:43.422 --> 01:32:45.325
I don't want an apology.

01:32:47.494 --> 01:32:49.597
What... What do you want?

01:32:50.529 --> 01:32:51.431
I want our life back.

01:32:52.632 --> 01:32:54.034
I want our marriage back.

01:32:55.668 --> 01:32:57.301
I want all the secrets
we've ignored

01:32:57.303 --> 01:32:59.440
for the past five years
out in the open.

01:33:11.618 --> 01:33:12.887
Open it.

01:33:13.921 --> 01:33:15.289
Whatever it says,
whoever it's from, just open it.

01:33:17.289 --> 01:33:18.658
There's no starting over.

01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:22.930
We tried that moving here.

01:33:25.998 --> 01:33:30.637
We can only go forward,
either together or apart.

01:33:32.204 --> 01:33:33.439
You can't change
what you've done,

01:33:34.641 --> 01:33:36.139
can't change that I stood by

01:33:36.141 --> 01:33:37.308
and I watched you make choices,

01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:38.479
even though you knew

01:33:39.512 --> 01:33:41.482
they could destroy
everything that we've built.

01:33:45.185 --> 01:33:46.620
Ellen, whatever you decide,

01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:51.091
I promise you
I will never lie to you again.

01:33:52.391 --> 01:33:53.693
I will always
tell you the truth.

01:33:56.628 --> 01:33:57.530
Yeah.
