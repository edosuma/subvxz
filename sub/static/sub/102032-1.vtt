WEBVTT

00:28.161 --> 00:31.131
Okay, let's
go, that's so loud

00:37.939 --> 00:41.910
Now this is how you make
a home-style jailhouse meal.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.612
Look at this.

01:04.799 --> 01:07.535
♪ Come meet me in
the main room ♪

06:04.632 --> 06:06.667
Is this the Neue Museum?

06:06.701 --> 06:09.136
This is the Alte Museum.

06:16.110 --> 06:21.115
I don't speak really good
German like behind human.

06:22.516 --> 06:25.753
There's a hallway of
columns adjacent to that.

06:25.786 --> 06:26.854
Okay, thank you.

06:26.888 --> 06:27.855
Yeah, okay.

06:27.889 --> 06:29.056
Where are you from?

06:29.090 --> 06:31.125
I'm from Barcelona.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.693
- Nice.
- Yeah, okay.

06:32.727 --> 06:34.095
I went to Barcelona once.

06:34.128 --> 06:35.596
Did you like it?

06:35.630 --> 06:36.731
A lot.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.833
You have a great
legacy of architecture.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.768
Yeah, we have Gaudi,
it's really great,

06:40.801 --> 06:42.469
it's nice.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.005
Are you from Berlin?

06:44.038 --> 06:45.907
Yes, I am from Berlin.

06:45.940 --> 06:47.775
What are you doing here?

06:47.808 --> 06:50.378
I am studying
History in Eureka,

06:50.410 --> 06:51.379
do you know it?

06:51.411 --> 06:52.380
Yeah.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.446
I'm like really new here,

06:53.480 --> 06:56.050
like I was a little bit lost.

06:56.083 --> 06:59.320
Just my phone died
then I'm like,

06:59.353 --> 07:01.055
like yeah, I don't
know so many people

07:01.088 --> 07:04.392
and it's a little
bit complicated.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.927
It's a big city.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.395
Yeah.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.096
My name is Paula.

07:09.130 --> 07:11.198
Joanna, nice to meet you.

07:11.232 --> 07:12.266
Thanks to you,
nice to meet you.

07:14.669 --> 07:19.540
Maybe you wanna have
a drink or something?

07:19.573 --> 07:21.309
I would love to.

07:22.276 --> 07:23.945
Your phone, it's broken now?

07:23.978 --> 07:25.579
- Yes.
- But you can call?

07:25.613 --> 07:27.748
Like, you can give me your
number and I can call you?

07:27.782 --> 07:29.116
Yeah.

07:30.051 --> 07:33.220
You have to just put like
zero, zero in the beginning.

07:33.254 --> 07:34.221
Zero, zero.

07:34.255 --> 07:35.222
- Three, four
- Three.

07:35.256 --> 07:36.691
Yeah, like a code.

07:36.724 --> 07:37.692
Okay.

07:37.725 --> 07:39.093
Six, five.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.796
Two, one, zero, four

07:41.829 --> 07:42.930
Zero, four.

07:42.964 --> 07:44.398
Nine, zero, four.

07:44.432 --> 07:45.498
Nine, zero, four.

07:45.533 --> 07:48.602
Okay. I hope to see you Paula.

07:48.636 --> 07:49.971
Enjoy.

09:44.318 --> 09:46.587
If I fall off I'll
fucking swim back,

09:46.620 --> 09:48.422
well, I don't give a fuck.

09:48.456 --> 09:50.525
I'm not trying to kill myself.

09:50.559 --> 09:52.793
I thought this was
a pirate ship man,

09:52.827 --> 09:55.129
I thought this was a
fucking pirate ship.

16:15.510 --> 16:16.811
Six.

16:16.845 --> 16:17.846
Six.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.149
- Seven.
- Seven.

16:58.786 --> 17:03.725
Your feeling fallen so fast,
it's like, if it's all right.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.093
Yeah.

17:07.060 --> 17:09.061
It's like this
instant connection.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.015
When I was like
five or six years old

17:27.047 --> 17:28.616
he pulled me out of the bathtub

17:28.650 --> 17:31.953
while I was taking a bath and
just slammed me on the ground.

17:33.387 --> 17:35.723
That's the first
beating I remember

17:35.757 --> 17:39.259
and you know stuff went
on like that for awhile.

17:39.293 --> 17:41.495
I don't remember much
else from those years.

17:44.966 --> 17:47.167
That was my first big
of heartbreak in life,

17:48.503 --> 17:50.370
I was really confused and hurt.

17:51.940 --> 17:54.107
After like two or
three fights like that,

17:54.141 --> 17:57.612
I had stashed a knife, a kitchen
knife in my room somewhere,

17:59.446 --> 18:00.982
I stashed it really good.

18:01.015 --> 18:03.483
And I was like,
thinking in my head,

18:03.518 --> 18:06.521
I have thoughts of actually
killing him in his sleep

18:06.554 --> 18:08.890
because I was so tired
of getting beat up on.

18:10.090 --> 18:11.059
I just lost it one day,

18:11.091 --> 18:12.492
he came in my room,

18:12.527 --> 18:15.663
he comes in with his fists
clenched, face turning red,

18:15.697 --> 18:17.397
vein popping out in his head

18:17.431 --> 18:20.467
and I know from that, that
he's about to beat me up.

18:20.501 --> 18:23.504
But I said, this time
I'm gonna fight back.

18:23.538 --> 18:26.841
I said, I don't care if I win
or lose, just check it out.

18:26.874 --> 18:28.241
If I win, then that's great,

18:28.275 --> 18:30.444
I would love to beat
the shit out of you.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.013
I said, but you
know you're bigger,

18:32.046 --> 18:33.447
you're stronger than me.

18:33.480 --> 18:36.216
If you win, which you
probably will, I don't care.

18:36.249 --> 18:39.053
I'll take an ass beating,
but I guarantee old man

18:39.087 --> 18:40.555
when it's all said and done,

18:40.588 --> 18:42.155
I don't know where,
I don't know when,

18:42.189 --> 18:43.625
but I will fucking kill you,

18:43.658 --> 18:46.561
'cause I'm sick of the
shit, I'll kill you.

18:46.594 --> 18:47.862
I told him that
and he backed away

18:47.895 --> 18:49.998
he never touched me again.

18:50.031 --> 18:52.667
And I was dead serious,
I wasn't fucking around.

18:55.069 --> 18:56.571
And that's that?

22:21.776 --> 22:22.743
Stop.

22:22.777 --> 22:24.111
Come on it's fun.

22:25.412 --> 22:26.413
Come on.

22:29.183 --> 22:30.483
Stop that.

22:58.246 --> 22:59.580
What?

23:01.682 --> 23:03.751
Why you didn't text me.

23:05.953 --> 23:06.921
Text you?

23:06.954 --> 23:08.556
Oh, I'm sorry I was super busy,

23:08.589 --> 23:13.160
like, I had this idea
I was thinking on,

23:13.194 --> 23:16.396
since had the last days, I
had a plan for this project.

23:16.429 --> 23:19.867
it would be super nice
to make it like in a...

23:21.401 --> 23:23.971
So you know, it's
like, it's quite a...

23:24.005 --> 23:25.306
It's like, I don't really know

23:25.339 --> 23:28.009
what exactly it's going
to be about but...

23:29.442 --> 23:33.581
The other day, I was reading
about a work of Shepard Howard

23:33.614 --> 23:35.049
and I was thinking of-

23:35.082 --> 23:38.185
- Like, you're gonna do this
thing of this houseboat,

23:38.219 --> 23:39.954
it's like a shared community.

23:39.987 --> 23:42.290
Like my idea was kind
of like this but bigger

23:42.323 --> 23:47.328
and has a high sense
of architecture.

23:48.763 --> 23:50.631
I think it's super, it's
like, it's not a houseboat

23:50.665 --> 23:52.133
but it's like a shared community

23:52.166 --> 23:56.938
where generations can like

23:58.372 --> 23:59.340
English, its like you're
speaking all the fucking time

23:59.373 --> 24:00.875
and you don't let me speak.

24:02.777 --> 24:04.812
Now what's wrong with you?

24:04.845 --> 24:06.180
- No, nothing.
- What did you take?

24:06.213 --> 24:07.949
- Paula what did you take?
- I'm just excited.

24:07.982 --> 24:10.685
I didn't take any drugs,
I'm just excited, okay?

24:10.718 --> 24:13.688
Like I want to make this project

24:13.721 --> 24:15.957
and if you want to join,
it would be amazing,

24:15.990 --> 24:17.959
we can think it
together, better.

24:17.992 --> 24:20.995
And I know that there's this
kind of this houseboat...

24:21.028 --> 24:22.396
Stop touching me.

24:23.397 --> 24:24.732
Paula.

24:24.765 --> 24:26.267
- I'm concentrating.
- Stop and listen.

24:26.300 --> 24:27.835
No, listen to me.

24:27.868 --> 24:28.836
I listen to you all the time.

24:28.869 --> 24:30.004
I'm concentrating.

24:30.037 --> 24:31.005
Really?

24:31.038 --> 24:32.106
Fuck Paula, what?

25:25.593 --> 25:28.095
Two nights ago,
Emily called me,

25:28.129 --> 25:31.332
I took a cab all the way
to her house at midnight.

25:32.767 --> 25:36.637
She smoked 20 cigarettes then
we talked for five minutes.

25:36.670 --> 25:40.307
And then I got into another cab
and went straight back home.

25:40.341 --> 25:42.109
Just to see her
for five minutes,

25:42.143 --> 25:44.412
just to bring her,
her fucking

25:44.445 --> 25:45.980
so she can feel better.

25:46.013 --> 25:49.083
Coz I love her and I don't
want to see her in pain.

27:07.495 --> 27:11.932
I know I should be looking
for 'em, my mom, my dad.

27:17.738 --> 27:21.075
I don't know what I even saw
in her in the first place man.

27:21.108 --> 27:22.343
I saw something different,

27:22.376 --> 27:24.845
and she didn't act like
this when we first met,

27:24.879 --> 27:28.449
no one acts like a piece of
shit when you first meet.

27:29.850 --> 27:32.554
If you acted like this yourself
as soon as you met somebody,

27:32.587 --> 27:34.288
you'd just scare them off.

29:18.259 --> 29:19.594
Fuck.

32:33.454 --> 32:34.589
She doesn't want
to talk to me,

32:34.622 --> 32:36.123
she doesn't want to see me.

32:37.257 --> 32:39.026
She doesn't talk
to me on the phone,

32:40.227 --> 32:42.196
I haven't seen her
in almost a month.

32:43.430 --> 32:45.098
We text each other a little bit,

32:46.033 --> 32:47.669
that's about it.

32:47.702 --> 32:49.036
Yeah, you're gonna text.

32:49.069 --> 32:51.305
I haven't even texted
her in a few days.

32:52.740 --> 32:53.808
I don't know I'm done,

32:55.275 --> 32:56.811
I'm done trying, if she
doesn't wanna be with me,

32:56.845 --> 32:58.780
she doesn't wanna be
with me, that's it.

32:58.813 --> 33:00.949
I wish she would just have the
guts to come out and say so

33:00.981 --> 33:03.116
instead of beating
around the bush.

33:04.619 --> 33:06.588
Look man, I don't wanna
sound like I know everything

33:06.621 --> 33:11.458
but I told you she's
not right for you.

33:12.459 --> 33:14.061
You gotta find somebody sober.

33:14.094 --> 33:15.429
It is what it is.
What am I gonna do?

33:15.462 --> 33:16.898
I can't force someone
to be in love with me,

33:16.931 --> 33:19.399
if she doesn't love me no more,
she doesn't want me no more.

33:19.433 --> 33:21.468
I'm not gonna fucking
cry about it either.

33:22.904 --> 33:24.238
You sure about that?

33:24.271 --> 33:25.239
I don't know.

33:25.272 --> 33:26.406
I'm like stuck in limbo,

33:26.440 --> 33:28.342
I don't know what
the fuck's going on.

33:29.644 --> 33:32.145
I mean, I have to
guess that though,

33:32.179 --> 33:34.682
I mean, I'm pretty cynical,
so I always guess the worst,

33:34.716 --> 33:37.284
but pretty much have to assume

33:37.317 --> 33:39.152
that she doesn't
love me anymore.

33:39.186 --> 33:41.689
Why would someone not want
to see me for a month?

33:41.723 --> 33:43.758
If I love someone,
I want to see them.

33:43.791 --> 33:45.259
I understand like
she needs space,

33:45.292 --> 33:47.361
if she needs space,
she needs space.

33:47.394 --> 33:49.597
But Jesus Christ like
a whole month goes by

33:49.631 --> 33:50.999
and she doesn't even
wanna see me once?

33:51.031 --> 33:52.600
Not even for a few hours?

33:52.634 --> 33:53.601
That sucks, man.

33:53.635 --> 33:55.904
It really does.

33:56.470 --> 33:57.839
Maybe you should
concentrate on the people

33:57.872 --> 33:59.373
that give a shit about you

33:59.406 --> 34:01.275
instead of the ones who
would rather see you die.

34:02.710 --> 34:04.012
I'm like, look at you man,

34:04.846 --> 34:05.847
you look like shit.

34:07.414 --> 34:09.583
You just sit here and
talk about yourself.

34:10.752 --> 34:14.487
Can you blame her not
wanting to be with you?

34:14.522 --> 34:16.456
I mean, you don't think
she was right a little bit.

34:16.489 --> 34:17.824
She is.

34:18.292 --> 34:19.493
But at the same time though,

34:19.527 --> 34:21.328
I wouldn't leave her
if she was doing that.

34:22.496 --> 34:23.463
I don't know, maybe,
I don't know man,

34:23.496 --> 34:25.600
her standards are high.

34:25.632 --> 34:27.234
I can tell you right now that,

34:28.503 --> 34:29.469
whatever you wanna
do with this girl

34:29.504 --> 34:31.103
it's not gonna go nowhere.

34:33.708 --> 34:36.109
I'ma leave you to make
that decision on your own.

34:36.143 --> 34:38.344
I guess my standards
aren't as high.

34:38.378 --> 34:41.014
If I love someone, I love
them through thick and thin,

34:41.049 --> 34:43.216
whether they're
drinking, whatever.

34:44.251 --> 34:46.119
That's that
unconditional fixation.

34:47.219 --> 34:48.956
You like something,

34:48.989 --> 34:52.192
so you perceive whatever
you like on to somebody else

34:52.225 --> 34:54.795
and then you mistake it
for unconditional love

34:54.829 --> 34:56.898
but it's not, man.

34:56.931 --> 34:58.800
You gotta love yourself first,

34:58.833 --> 35:00.635
I can tell that you don't.

35:00.668 --> 35:01.869
I know.

35:01.903 --> 35:03.370
Look at you,

35:03.403 --> 35:04.872
you had so much potential
when we was growing up,

35:07.174 --> 35:08.610
now you're just rotting away.

35:10.344 --> 35:12.647
You need to get
back into boxing.

35:12.680 --> 35:14.515
You act like you're the only
one that's ever felt bad,

35:14.549 --> 35:17.685
I mean, I went through my
struggles with my writing,

35:17.719 --> 35:20.588
but I'm back on my feet.

35:20.622 --> 35:25.627
And to watch you just
destroy yourself sucks dude,

35:27.762 --> 35:31.799
I can't sit here and watch
you kill yourself, I can't.

35:38.706 --> 35:39.874
I'll talk to you later.

36:07.535 --> 36:11.639
Twice, I got fucking
jumped with baseball bats

36:11.673 --> 36:14.008
and I'm the one
who gets arrested

36:14.042 --> 36:15.475
and my attackers
don't get arrested,

36:15.510 --> 36:16.577
how the fuck is that?

36:18.178 --> 36:20.648
Now, let me tell you
about the NYPD, right?

36:20.682 --> 36:23.751
So they're supposed to
protect and serve us,

36:23.785 --> 36:25.119
they don't fucking do that.

36:26.486 --> 36:27.855
In the park, motherfuckers,

36:27.889 --> 36:30.858
there's the girl who
said I stole her tablet.

36:32.060 --> 36:33.761
And then the cops get
there, I get arrested.

36:33.795 --> 36:35.563
And I'm telling the
cops all the time,

36:35.596 --> 36:36.564
I don't have a tablet on me,

36:36.597 --> 36:38.132
what are you arresting me for?

36:38.166 --> 36:39.834
No, she said you stole
her tablet last night.

36:39.867 --> 36:41.035
Last night?

36:41.069 --> 36:42.670
Then why didn't she call
you guys last night?

36:42.704 --> 36:44.271
What are you worrying
about me for anyway

36:44.304 --> 36:46.574
when this fucking kid
stabbed my friend.

36:46.607 --> 36:48.109
There's someone laying
right across the street,

36:48.142 --> 36:49.844
is what it feels like right now.

36:49.877 --> 36:51.879
I'm like, but why don't
you go look at my friend?

36:51.913 --> 36:52.880
Oh, we'll look into it,

36:52.914 --> 36:54.481
they never looked into it.

36:54.515 --> 36:59.120
And then, like a few months
ago I get jumped again

36:59.153 --> 37:00.588
by people with bats

37:00.621 --> 37:04.058
and I get arrested again
because the window got broken.

37:04.092 --> 37:06.460
Like come on y'all, twice.

37:06.493 --> 37:09.197
And the motherfucker was
hitting me with baseball bat.

37:10.665 --> 37:12.967
In this city, you can jump
someone with baseball bats

37:13.000 --> 37:14.869
and if you call the cops first

37:14.902 --> 37:16.971
and say, oh, they
fucked with me first.

37:17.004 --> 37:19.207
They aren't gonna get arrested.

37:19.239 --> 37:21.209
And see, that's the
NYPD for you, man.

40:12.747 --> 40:13.748
Hey.

40:14.481 --> 40:15.816
Are you okay?

40:16.751 --> 40:17.885
Yes.

40:17.919 --> 40:19.720
I can walk you
down the subway.

40:21.756 --> 40:23.624
Are you sure?

40:55.957 --> 40:59.026
Listen, if I told you
what I was doing right now,

41:00.227 --> 41:01.762
you say you wouldn't
look at me differently

41:01.796 --> 41:04.098
but I'm pretty sure you would.

41:05.366 --> 41:06.767
I'm so misunderstood,

41:06.801 --> 41:11.672
no one will ever understand
what I go through.

41:11.706 --> 41:12.873
Those problems?

41:17.445 --> 41:18.779
What is hell?

41:19.347 --> 41:21.449
I have no bank account,
it's in the red.

41:23.517 --> 41:24.952
In New York City right now,

41:24.986 --> 41:26.821
this girl is the only
thing that makes me happy.

41:28.289 --> 41:30.324
Just spending time with her
and she's never coming back.

41:30.358 --> 41:32.492
- You taste like alcohol.
- You finally smelled me,

41:32.526 --> 41:33.995
I knew you would do that

41:34.028 --> 41:36.764
You taste like fucking
alcohol, so you're lying.

41:36.797 --> 41:38.966
I'm losing weight,
you know why?

41:39.000 --> 41:40.468
Not because I'm on drugs

41:40.501 --> 41:42.970
because I actually just
don't have enough food

41:43.004 --> 41:44.405
to eat in the house.

41:44.438 --> 41:45.740
Oh my God, why do I have to?

41:45.773 --> 41:47.274
What are you so mad at me for?

41:47.308 --> 41:51.112
Because it's like I only
have to deal with your needs.

41:51.145 --> 41:52.913
Are you fucking serious?

41:52.947 --> 41:54.148
When we're at my house,

41:54.181 --> 41:56.083
do you know how many
things you asked me for?

41:56.117 --> 41:57.151
I asked you for one thing,

41:57.184 --> 41:58.953
what else have I asked you for.

41:58.986 --> 42:00.488
Oh, shut up.

42:01.255 --> 42:03.858
And then besides this, I'm
stuck in this lifestyle now

42:03.891 --> 42:06.427
just doing things I
don't wanna be doing.

42:09.530 --> 42:11.165
Aww, what the fuck?

42:12.501 --> 42:15.169
You fucked up my makeup asshole.

42:30.284 --> 42:32.920
I know deep down
I have a good heart

42:32.953 --> 42:35.456
but you know I do
fucked up things.

42:35.489 --> 42:36.690
And you told me 90 days

42:36.724 --> 42:38.459
well 90 days are like
what, three months?

42:38.492 --> 42:39.894
Then you'll know like
I've really changed

42:39.927 --> 42:41.495
for almost three months.

42:41.530 --> 42:43.364
But you've drank, of course.

42:43.397 --> 42:45.032
I've drank a few times.

42:45.066 --> 42:47.635
I feel like you can't go
90 days without drinking

42:47.668 --> 42:49.303
if you tried.

42:49.336 --> 42:50.638
I could.

42:50.671 --> 42:51.906
So then why don't
you just do it?

42:51.939 --> 42:53.808
Because
I can and I will.

42:53.841 --> 42:55.843
I'm not drinking today,
I didn't drink yesterday.

42:55.876 --> 42:58.513
You said it's all
about today, right?

42:58.547 --> 43:00.047
I don't know.

43:00.081 --> 43:01.248
If you don't have faith in me,
you don't have faith in me.

43:01.282 --> 43:03.084
I do have faith in you Mike.

43:03.117 --> 43:04.952
Well, then you know
you're still bringing it up

43:04.985 --> 43:07.488
and I feel like once
you go to this rehab

43:07.522 --> 43:09.723
that you're going to think
about that even more.

43:09.757 --> 43:10.825
And then you're
gonna start thinking,

43:10.858 --> 43:12.359
oh, I'm gone for a month,

43:12.393 --> 43:14.395
he's probably drinking
all the time now.

43:15.596 --> 43:16.864
I am going to hell,

43:18.165 --> 43:21.068
you don't even get to
suffer with any company,

43:22.103 --> 43:24.271
there's no solidarity in hell.

43:26.307 --> 43:29.643
You don't even get
to see the devil,

43:29.677 --> 43:31.312
probably.

49:29.203 --> 49:31.371
Oh, welcome, hi.

51:27.689 --> 51:29.023
Fucker.

51:31.759 --> 51:32.827
Motherfucker.

51:38.198 --> 51:39.534
My God.

51:41.101 --> 51:42.336
I have a chair.

51:42.369 --> 51:43.337
I have a chair.

51:43.370 --> 51:45.707
I'll get on the chair and do it.

51:45.740 --> 51:46.708
Just give me.

51:46.741 --> 51:47.709
No, I wanna do it.

51:47.742 --> 51:49.142
Let me do it.

51:49.176 --> 51:51.378
I don't want you to step on
the chair with your shoes.

51:52.880 --> 51:53.948
What?

51:53.982 --> 51:55.817
What's wrong with my shoes ever?

51:55.850 --> 51:58.151
I've never worn
these shoes outside.

51:58.185 --> 51:59.654
This is it?

51:59.687 --> 52:01.522
I can't see you again tonight?

52:01.556 --> 52:03.758
I told you I'm going to
my grandmother's house,

52:03.791 --> 52:04.959
I'm having dinner with her.

52:04.993 --> 52:06.594
So this is the last
time I'll see you?

52:06.628 --> 52:09.764
Before I go, I guess.

52:09.797 --> 52:11.131
Wow.

52:11.799 --> 52:13.400
We should've left
at a good note.

52:16.504 --> 52:19.707
I know this is like a
difficult moment for you.

52:19.741 --> 52:21.308
A lot of things.

52:21.341 --> 52:22.644
Because every time man.

52:22.677 --> 52:26.179
Every single time
that we've been apart

52:26.213 --> 52:27.815
for more than a few days,

52:27.849 --> 52:29.884
you've thought about leaving me

52:29.917 --> 52:31.418
and now it's gonna be a month,

52:32.386 --> 52:33.888
what's gonna happen this time?

52:35.322 --> 52:38.860
I'm going to a rehab,
so it's a different...

52:38.893 --> 52:40.061
I'm going okay.

58:39.053 --> 58:40.721
This is really
important to me.

58:40.755 --> 58:42.790
I don't know what's gonna
happen in the next month,

58:42.823 --> 58:44.592
I don't know what's
happen with my life.

58:44.625 --> 58:47.094
So I feel like this is
the only thing I got left.

58:48.696 --> 58:50.297
- Stop.
- It's really important.

58:50.331 --> 58:51.866
- It is defeatist.
- It's really important.

58:51.899 --> 58:54.535
I'm not defeatist, I'm realist.

58:54.568 --> 58:56.203
So it's really important to me,

58:56.237 --> 58:58.039
I'm definitely not
not a defeatist.

58:58.072 --> 59:01.008
Well saying that this is
all you have is sort of...

59:01.042 --> 59:02.243
I'm not in a defeatist,

59:02.276 --> 59:03.244
I said, I don't know
what's going to happen

59:03.277 --> 59:04.678
in the next month.

59:04.712 --> 59:06.914
A lot of things are
looking very bleak for me.

59:06.947 --> 59:08.149
I might be in jail,

59:08.182 --> 59:10.051
I might have no career anymore,

59:10.084 --> 59:12.453
I might not have Emily anymore.

59:12.486 --> 59:13.687
It's all in my hands

59:13.721 --> 59:15.156
and I'm trying to
do the right thing,

59:15.189 --> 59:19.994
but if people don't have faith
in me, I can't blame them.

59:22.196 --> 59:24.065
I made my bed and
I'm gonna lie in it

59:29.570 --> 59:30.571
I'm Sorry.

59:36.110 --> 59:37.478
I hope you're okay.

59:41.348 --> 59:44.452
And I hope it's not my
fault if you're not okay.

59:44.485 --> 59:46.187
Yo, watch where
you're going man

59:50.057 --> 59:51.560
And I'm
sorry for everything.

59:51.592 --> 59:53.627
I wish I could take it back,

59:56.397 --> 59:57.631
but I can't do this.

01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:21.242
I'm a grown up
now am an adult.

01:12:23.277 --> 01:12:25.746
I can't be thinking like
a young kid anymore,

01:12:26.647 --> 01:12:27.748
I'm not in my twenties anymore,

01:12:27.782 --> 01:12:29.717
am not a teenager anymore.

01:12:46.667 --> 01:12:48.736
I got bigger and better
things to look forward to

01:12:48.769 --> 01:12:52.173
and I'm a street brat,

01:12:52.206 --> 01:12:55.209
those days are over,
I've started to grow up.

01:12:55.243 --> 01:12:57.011
I am a man who fuck up.

01:14:15.523 --> 01:14:20.460
I have anger issues, I'm
trying to work on them.

01:14:21.461 --> 01:14:24.899
It's not easy.

01:14:24.932 --> 01:14:28.536
Maybe I get it
from my father.

01:14:38.879 --> 01:14:40.715
I have a real rage issue,

01:14:42.016 --> 01:14:43.985
its probably used to
be brain game

01:14:44.018 --> 01:14:47.655
I mean, the abuse
is not just physical.

01:14:47.688 --> 01:14:51.225
its like watching my
father scream at my mother

01:14:51.258 --> 01:14:53.260
and treat her like shit.

01:15:08.542 --> 01:15:11.212
This is what happens when you
are abused as a fucking child

01:15:11.245 --> 01:15:14.915
and violently
abused like I was,

01:15:14.949 --> 01:15:18.552
go on to have anger
problem and stuff.

01:15:18.586 --> 01:15:20.221
There are other people

01:15:20.254 --> 01:15:22.456
and it seems life that's
what I suffer from.

01:15:42.209 --> 01:15:45.479
I've been through a lot of shit,
a lot of suffering.

01:15:45.514 --> 01:15:48.916
Suffering builds character,
it definitely fucking does.

01:19:09.116 --> 01:19:10.117
Hey.

01:19:14.355 --> 01:19:15.690
I'm sorry.

01:19:24.733 --> 01:19:25.833
It's a flower for you.

01:19:32.406 --> 01:19:33.708
What?

01:19:33.742 --> 01:19:34.709
What?

01:19:34.743 --> 01:19:36.243
What going on?

01:19:37.646 --> 01:19:40.147
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:42.349
You're gonna just
disappearing like that?

01:19:43.984 --> 01:19:45.720
And give me flowers?

01:19:47.756 --> 01:19:49.056
It doesn't work like that.

01:19:53.827 --> 01:19:54.763
- I'm sorry...
- No really,

01:19:54.795 --> 01:19:56.030
its not okay.

01:19:58.966 --> 01:20:00.669
Your brother told
me what you did.

01:20:04.171 --> 01:20:05.372
So what?

01:20:05.406 --> 01:20:06.907
What's going on?

01:20:09.476 --> 01:20:11.579
I'm sorry I didn't
wanna tell you.

01:20:11.613 --> 01:20:12.846
Tell me what?

01:20:16.751 --> 01:20:18.085
I'm sick.

01:20:19.788 --> 01:20:20.988
Sick?

01:20:21.021 --> 01:20:22.724
I have bipolar disorder.

01:20:26.193 --> 01:20:27.529
Okay.

01:20:29.863 --> 01:20:31.465
You're crazy my love.

01:20:32.933 --> 01:20:37.539
Like not crazy, like
this is not sick, okay.

01:20:38.839 --> 01:20:41.208
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:20:41.241 --> 01:20:46.748
I don't care, I'm here you
have to tell me these things.

01:20:48.148 --> 01:20:51.385
I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry.

01:20:54.622 --> 01:20:56.290
I'm here, okay?

01:20:56.323 --> 01:20:57.491
Okay.

01:22:25.412 --> 01:22:26.380
Nice jacket.

01:22:26.413 --> 01:22:32.386
Thanks.

01:22:32.419 --> 01:22:33.922
I like the blueberry.

01:22:35.523 --> 01:22:36.490
The jacket?

01:22:36.524 --> 01:22:37.491
Muffin.

01:22:53.608 --> 01:22:55.309
Where are you from?

01:22:55.342 --> 01:22:56.477
From Russia.

01:22:56.511 --> 01:22:57.545
Wow, its cool so far.

01:22:58.580 --> 01:22:59.547
What brings you here?

01:22:59.581 --> 01:23:00.548
Study.

01:23:00.582 --> 01:23:02.550
Study what?

01:23:02.584 --> 01:23:03.885
Cultural studies.
