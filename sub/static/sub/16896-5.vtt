25:28.027 --> 25:29.485
Yeah. Yeah.

25:34.325 --> 25:36.743
So how was dinner?

25:36.911 --> 25:38.828
Fine. She was nice.

25:38.996 --> 25:40.079
Good.

25:41.290 --> 25:43.791
Hey, thanks for filling in.

25:44.627 --> 25:48.379
So there's not anything
I should know about, or?

25:48.547 --> 25:50.381
Not really. Except...

25:50.758 --> 25:52.217
I...

[MIKE GROANS]

25:53.552 --> 25:59.098
- She wants to see me again, Ray.
- She said that?

25:59.600 --> 26:00.725
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

26:00.893 --> 26:02.185
I hope that's okay.

[RAY STAMMERS]

26:03.812 --> 26:05.772
That's fine. I... That's fine.

26:05.940 --> 26:08.775
Because I know you were supposed
to be there instead of me...

26:08.943 --> 26:11.402
...but, honestly...

26:11.570 --> 26:14.656
...Ray, I don't know why
a woman like that...

26:14.823 --> 26:17.575
...would need to pay to have someone
take her to dinner.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.078
Yeah.

26:21.455 --> 26:23.289
I like her, Ray.

26:24.375 --> 26:27.961
- I like her a lot.
- Well, that's...

26:28.128 --> 26:32.423
Hey, that's super.
That's super news, Mike.

26:32.591 --> 26:35.176
- Yeah? Thanks. Thanks.
- Yeah.

26:35.344 --> 26:39.681
I gotta get going.
I gotta make photocopies for my next class.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.516
Sure, buddy.

26:42.351 --> 26:44.727
Hey, Ray. Ray.

26:45.562 --> 26:49.774
Today is a great day,
and I feel wonderful.
