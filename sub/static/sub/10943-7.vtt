<i>Amy:
Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:03.789 --> 00:05.724
<i>Jack: Sorry to
hear about the split.</i>

00:05.791 --> 00:07.559
Well, news sure does
travel fast around here.

00:07.627 --> 00:10.295
But uh...
It's just a break.

00:10.363 --> 00:11.896
Almost makes me wanna work
at Maggie's again.

00:11.964 --> 00:13.064
No way.
I need you here

00:13.133 --> 00:14.766
to help me
with the baby.

00:14.834 --> 00:17.034
Nice to feel appreciated.
Who knew?

00:17.102 --> 00:18.136
I was kinda hoping
that you might give me

00:18.203 --> 00:19.770
another chance, too,
son.

00:19.838 --> 00:21.172
Son?

00:21.240 --> 00:22.507
Wait. Wait a second,
we're still talking.

00:22.574 --> 00:23.941
Don't walk away from me!

00:24.009 --> 00:25.709
Shane: Yeah, well, you
walked away from me.

00:25.777 --> 00:26.844
Shane.

00:28.447 --> 00:29.747
You can call me anytime.

00:29.814 --> 00:31.948
<i>And think about the summer--</i>

00:32.016 --> 00:33.816
<i>it's wide open.</i>

00:36.987 --> 00:38.021
He hates me.

00:45.129 --> 00:47.796
Tim: Well, bet you're happy
to be finished school.

00:49.666 --> 00:52.434
Leave any girlfriends
behind?

00:52.502 --> 00:53.769
Nope.

00:53.836 --> 00:56.172
Well, I am really,

00:56.239 --> 00:57.673
really glad
you changed your mind

00:57.740 --> 00:59.107
and decided to spend
the summer,

00:59.176 --> 01:01.577
because we are gonna
have some fun.

01:03.212 --> 01:05.046
<i>They closed that road.</i>

01:05.113 --> 01:07.182
<i>There was a rock slide.</i>

01:08.116 --> 01:10.051
Wiped it right out
a few weeks ago.

01:10.118 --> 01:11.286
<i>Shane:
Oh yeah?</i>

01:11.353 --> 01:12.520
Hey, you know what?

01:12.588 --> 01:14.222
There's an old movie set
up there.

01:14.290 --> 01:16.457
It's like
an old Western town.

01:16.525 --> 01:18.259
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

01:18.327 --> 01:20.026
Some of those old westerns
are pretty cool.

01:20.094 --> 01:23.063
Oh, yeah.
Oh yeah, I love 'em.

01:23.130 --> 01:26.667
I think "Stagecoach,"
remember "Stagecoach"?

01:26.734 --> 01:28.669
"My Darling Clementine,"

01:28.736 --> 01:29.869
and "Shane."

01:29.937 --> 01:31.705
You might've been named
after "Shane."

01:31.772 --> 01:33.106
I don't think so.

01:33.174 --> 01:35.274
I've never heard
of those ones.

01:35.342 --> 01:37.310
I like, you know,
"Young Guns,"

01:37.377 --> 01:38.844
"Desperado,"

01:38.912 --> 01:40.413
"Shanghai Noon."

01:40.480 --> 01:43.015
Yeah, well, those movies
were made in the nineties.

01:43.083 --> 01:45.384
Yeah. Like I said,
you know, they're old.

01:49.989 --> 01:51.056
Yeah.

01:52.858 --> 01:54.226
(Truck rumbles)

01:57.330 --> 01:58.563
(Hoof strikes the ground loudly)

02:00.533 --> 02:01.600
(Bull grunts)

02:03.902 --> 02:05.470
(Snorted breath)

02:05.538 --> 02:07.171
Chad:
When I nod...

02:08.139 --> 02:09.906
Gimme a fast gate.

02:09.973 --> 02:12.075
(Bull grunts and snorts)

02:15.280 --> 02:16.413
(Gate rattles)

02:16.481 --> 02:18.014
(Bull grunts wildly)

02:18.983 --> 02:20.083
Waylon:
Hey!

02:20.151 --> 02:21.084
Hey!

02:21.152 --> 02:23.086
(Bull grunts and snorts)

02:29.693 --> 02:31.294
Waylon:
Hey! Whoa!

02:38.535 --> 02:39.701
Hey, bull! Bull!

02:39.769 --> 02:40.869
Chad:
Wooo!

02:42.472 --> 02:43.739
Waylon:
Got 'em!

02:43.806 --> 02:45.173
Chad: (Triumphant laugh) Woo!

02:45.241 --> 02:48.744
Men: Hey! All right!
You looked great, kid!

02:48.811 --> 02:50.479
Chad:
Not bad, hey buddy?

02:50.546 --> 02:52.213
Chad's riding great!

02:52.282 --> 02:54.316
Yeah,
he's got Dad's talent.

02:54.384 --> 02:57.351
All I got are his flat feet
and lady hands.

02:57.419 --> 02:59.154
You should get Chad
to give me some pointers.

02:59.221 --> 03:00.655
I wanna try bulls.

03:00.722 --> 03:02.290
Well, now, I guess light
really does travel

03:02.357 --> 03:03.491
faster than sound.

03:03.558 --> 03:04.492
You always seem
so bright,

03:04.559 --> 03:05.593
until you speak.

03:05.661 --> 03:06.661
I'm serious.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.096
Come on now, Caleb.

03:08.164 --> 03:09.864
A bull'd shake you faster
than Ms. Ponaka did

03:09.932 --> 03:13.600
- a few years back.
- What's your problem today?

03:13.668 --> 03:15.435
I'm in a bad mood,
all right?

03:15.503 --> 03:16.670
It's my ride.

03:16.737 --> 03:18.605
I'm having serious
engine trouble.

03:18.673 --> 03:19.807
Tell you what.

03:19.874 --> 03:20.874
Get your brother
to give me lessons,

03:20.942 --> 03:22.943
and I got a guy
who can fix your ride.

03:23.011 --> 03:24.778
Think about it.

03:26.580 --> 03:27.914
(Truck rumbles)

03:32.219 --> 03:36.088
Shane: Hey, Pal! Hey, Amy!
Amy: Welcome home, Shane.

03:36.156 --> 03:37.389
Shane:
Can we go for a ride?

03:37.457 --> 03:38.991
Amy: What, already?
Shane: Yeah, yeah.

03:39.059 --> 03:40.893
Shane: Come on, let's get
Pal and Spartan tacked up.

03:40.961 --> 03:42.862
<i>Amy: Well, don't you wanna get
settled at Big River first?</i>

03:42.930 --> 03:44.095
You know, I kinda wish

03:44.163 --> 03:47.032
I was staying here
with you guys.

03:47.099 --> 03:48.867
<i>Tim:
Shane!</i>

03:48.935 --> 03:50.535
Tim:
Hey!

03:50.602 --> 03:52.337
Got you a welcome home gift.
(Laughs)

03:54.140 --> 03:55.307
Uh... thanks.

03:56.209 --> 03:58.043
Yeah, you can practice
roping him.

03:58.110 --> 04:00.244
Cowboys rope steers.

04:00.312 --> 04:02.612
Well, you gotta start
somewhere.

04:03.514 --> 04:05.015
My dad got me
one of these little guys

04:05.083 --> 04:06.650
when I was seven.

04:06.718 --> 04:08.585
Dad, he's not seven.

04:11.156 --> 04:13.657
Could we just go
for a ride?

04:13.725 --> 04:16.459
Yeah.
Let's go grab the saddles.

Lou:
Katie's leaked through again.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.246
Why're you looking at me?

05:13.314 --> 05:14.514
Because you never
pull out the back properly

05:14.581 --> 05:15.648
and you give her
a diaper wedgie.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.450
She just squirms
when I change her.

05:17.518 --> 05:18.751
I don't need excuses,

05:18.819 --> 05:20.485
I need you to give her
a bath now.

05:20.553 --> 05:21.987
- Fine.
- Thank you.

05:22.055 --> 05:24.990
And please remember to wash
under her neck this time.

05:25.058 --> 05:27.126

I know it's tough

but she's helping
the best she can.

05:31.564 --> 05:32.831
<i>Lou:
Well, she better be;</i>

05:32.899 --> 05:34.099
We're paying her double
her usual fee.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.234
(Chuckles)

05:37.369 --> 05:39.904
Hey, Tim,
where's Shane?

05:39.972 --> 05:41.739
Went for a ride with Amy.

05:41.807 --> 05:43.674
Couldn't wait
to get away from me.

05:43.742 --> 05:46.177
Can't do anything right
for the kid.

05:46.245 --> 05:48.179
He hates me.

05:48.247 --> 05:50.148
Seriously,
he hates me.

05:50.215 --> 05:51.849
<i>Jack:
You gotta stop saying that.</i>

05:51.917 --> 05:53.483
He just needs
a little time.

05:53.551 --> 05:55.852
Yeah, well, time's up,
he's here,

05:55.920 --> 05:57.854
and it's gonna be a long summer
if this keeps up.

05:57.922 --> 05:59.456
Well,
what does he like to do?

05:59.523 --> 06:01.325
Well, he likes to...

06:01.392 --> 06:04.394
Get as far way from me
as possible,

06:04.462 --> 06:05.963
and old westerns,
apparently.

06:06.030 --> 06:07.864
Jack:
Oh, another John Wayne fan?

06:07.932 --> 06:09.598
No, more like Jackie Chan.

06:09.666 --> 06:10.799
Hmm.

06:10.867 --> 06:13.135
I got his attention
for five seconds

06:13.203 --> 06:15.671
when I told him
about that old movie set

06:15.738 --> 06:17.606
up at Cook's Pass.

06:17.674 --> 06:18.941
<i>Lou: Well, that's something.
You could take him up there.</i>

06:19.009 --> 06:20.376
Can't;
That road's still closed.

06:20.444 --> 06:22.411
You can't get up there.

06:24.913 --> 06:25.981
Not by car.

06:27.649 --> 06:28.749
Okay.

06:29.952 --> 06:32.720
Hey, Ty.
Uh, this is...

06:32.788 --> 06:33.721
I gotta go.

06:33.789 --> 06:34.922
This is Waylon Rogers.

06:34.991 --> 06:36.924
He's been on the circuit
since I started.

06:36.993 --> 06:38.593
Good to meet you.

06:38.660 --> 06:40.461
Caleb and I got to talking
over at the bull pens.

06:40.528 --> 06:43.730
He says you can, uh,
super-charge my ride.

06:43.798 --> 06:44.664
Well, I can take a look
at it.

06:44.732 --> 06:46.533
What kind of bike
you got?

06:46.601 --> 06:47.667
Not a bike.

06:49.404 --> 06:50.804
(Engine rumbles)

06:56.377 --> 06:57.576
Caleb:
(Laughs)

06:58.512 --> 06:59.745
What is that?

06:59.813 --> 07:00.946
It's a bathtub on wheels.

07:01.015 --> 07:02.248
What, are you blind
or something?

07:02.316 --> 07:04.517
Caleb:
He's a rodeo clown.

07:05.952 --> 07:08.221
I need to jump this sucker
off a three-foot ramp,

07:08.288 --> 07:10.356
over a tank
full of piranhas.

07:10.424 --> 07:11.524
Piranhas?

07:11.591 --> 07:12.891
Well, actually,
it's gold fish,

07:12.958 --> 07:16.261
but the crowd's
too far away to notice.

07:16.329 --> 07:20.365
You mounted a bathtub
on an ATV chassis.

07:20.433 --> 07:22.634
And how fast
do you want this to go?

07:22.701 --> 07:24.903
Fast enough
to jump six feet.

07:24.970 --> 07:26.271
You want this to jump six feet?
(Cell phone rings)

07:26.339 --> 07:28.006
Yeah.
Are you crazy?

07:28.073 --> 07:29.473
That's what
my psychiatrist said,

07:29.541 --> 07:31.342
so I told him
I wanted a second opinion.

07:31.410 --> 07:34.011
He says, "Okay,
you're ugly too." Heh.

07:36.114 --> 07:37.781
Tough crowd.

07:37.849 --> 07:38.982
Think you can do it?

07:39.051 --> 07:41.452
Uh, yeah,
I'll give it a shot.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.554
Awesome!
Hey, Dougie,

07:43.621 --> 07:45.855
the boxers were s'posed to have
the polka dots, not my cape.

07:45.923 --> 07:46.989
Thanks for the referral,
man,

07:47.058 --> 07:48.425
but I thought
you were talking bikes,

07:48.492 --> 07:49.592
not bathtubs.

07:49.660 --> 07:52.429
Figured you'd just like
the challenge.

07:52.496 --> 07:55.097
So what were you doing
at the bull pens anyway?

07:55.165 --> 07:56.098
You're not thinking
of uh...

07:56.166 --> 07:57.799
Agh! Why not, man?

07:57.867 --> 07:59.134
Talk to any bull rider,

07:59.202 --> 08:01.002
they'll tell ya
it's the best rush there is.

08:01.071 --> 08:03.004
What about broncs?

08:03.073 --> 08:04.940
Mm. I've been doing it
for a long time.

08:05.007 --> 08:06.741
Time for a new challenge,
you know?

08:06.809 --> 08:08.544
Take it
to the next level.

08:08.611 --> 08:10.044
<i>Waylon: What part of
"Carrie Underwood look-alike"</i>

08:10.111 --> 08:11.946
<i>do you not understand?</i>

08:12.013 --> 08:13.281
Dinner was amazing.

08:13.348 --> 08:15.951
Surprised you can taste it
you ate it so fast.

08:17.219 --> 08:19.787
I have to ask...
Uh, what's up with the goat?

08:22.558 --> 08:23.824
What?

08:23.892 --> 08:24.959
He got me a goat.

08:26.427 --> 08:27.794
To practice his roping.

08:27.861 --> 08:29.596
A goat for roping?

08:29.663 --> 08:31.298
Yeah, that's what
I started on-- a goat.

08:31.365 --> 08:33.032
(Laughs)

08:33.101 --> 08:34.634
Tim: And I got buckles for
roping at every major rodeo,

08:34.702 --> 08:36.869
so... try beating that,
buddy.

08:36.937 --> 08:38.572
Well, maybe I could,

08:38.639 --> 08:40.207
but I'm gonna stick
with just one event.

08:40.274 --> 08:42.475
Well, I've got a pretty good
track record in broncs too.

08:42.542 --> 08:44.843
<i>Caleb: Ah. Well, I'm
actually switching to bulls.</i>

08:44.911 --> 08:46.445
Whoa.

08:46.513 --> 08:48.347
You know, bull riders are like
the toughest guys out there.

08:48.415 --> 08:52.351
<i>Mallory: Yeah. Nothing says
tough like a full body cast.</i>

08:52.419 --> 08:53.986
<i>Shane:
Hey, did you ever ride bulls?</i>

08:54.053 --> 08:56.522
<i>Tim: Yup.
Once, and one time was enough.</i>

08:56.590 --> 08:59.390
Always thought it was
a little more stupid than tough.

08:59.458 --> 09:01.426
Caleb, have you actually
ridden a bull yet?

09:01.494 --> 09:03.894
No. But, uh, maybe tomorrow.

09:03.962 --> 09:05.796
Really?
Can I come watch?

09:05.864 --> 09:08.399
Tim: Actually, I have
a surprise for you.

09:08.467 --> 09:09.534
Not a goat.

09:10.802 --> 09:12.437
It's a trip,
on horseback.

09:12.505 --> 09:14.070
Really.

09:14.139 --> 09:16.473
Like...
Just the two of us?

09:18.109 --> 09:20.910
And also,
I have a good idea.

09:20.978 --> 09:23.113
Amy and Lou should come.

09:23.181 --> 09:24.214
Um...

09:26.251 --> 09:29.252
A family trip--
all three of my kids,

09:29.319 --> 09:30.653
first time.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.821
<i>Really, really fun.</i>

09:36.059 --> 09:37.926
Lou.

09:37.994 --> 09:40.129
Lou, now it was your idea
to visit the movie set

09:40.197 --> 09:41.497
- in the first place.
- Yeah, Dad,

09:41.565 --> 09:43.132
I said you should
take Shane.

09:44.067 --> 09:45.933
You know, this trip
should be the two of you

09:46.001 --> 09:47.669
so you can get to know
each other better.

09:47.736 --> 09:48.903
What's so wrong with me

09:48.971 --> 09:50.505
wanting to take
my daughters too?

09:50.573 --> 09:51.973
You just want us there
as a buffer

09:52.041 --> 09:54.576
because you're uncomfortable
with him.

09:54.644 --> 09:55.743
I don't wanna go,
with him, alone.

09:55.811 --> 09:58.380
You have to come.
Please?

09:58.447 --> 09:59.614
I can't.

09:59.682 --> 10:00.748
You know, Peter's away
at a job interview

10:00.816 --> 10:02.783
and I have to watch Katie.

10:02.850 --> 10:04.652
Lou, that's what you
pay me for.

10:04.719 --> 10:06.520
Seriously,
go have some fun.

10:06.588 --> 10:07.655
<i>Please.</i>

10:09.157 --> 10:10.524
Covered.

10:10.592 --> 10:11.958
Amy's coming!

10:12.026 --> 10:13.427
<i>Tim:
Really? Great.</i>

10:13.495 --> 10:15.996
<i>Okay, so, everybody in?</i>

10:20.568 --> 10:22.169
Okay. I'm in.

10:22.236 --> 10:23.970
(Laughs happily)
Okay, this...

10:24.038 --> 10:26.239
This is gonna be
so much fun.

10:26.307 --> 10:28.575
It'll be like
our old family vacations.

10:28.642 --> 10:30.911
Great...
Just like one of those.

10:31.879 --> 10:32.913
(Rooster crows)

10:35.648 --> 10:36.882
(Horses snort and nicker)

10:38.651 --> 10:40.019
Shane:
Oh, oh, Amy.

10:40.087 --> 10:41.987
Um, can you show me
where to tie off my rope?

10:42.055 --> 10:44.757
Oh, why don't you ask Dad?
He's the roping expert.

10:44.825 --> 10:48.828
Tim: Oh, yeah.
Let your dad help ya.

10:49.729 --> 10:51.495
Okay, what were you
gonna do there?

10:51.563 --> 10:52.931
Here, I'll show ya.

10:52.998 --> 10:54.498
You never wanna put this
at the back

10:54.566 --> 10:56.467
'cause you might get
your foot caught in it.

10:56.535 --> 10:57.836
Here, move out of the way.
I'm gonna show you.

10:57.903 --> 10:59.704
You just wanna keep it
up in front, like this.

10:59.772 --> 11:01.806
Wrap it a couple times
over the horn,

11:01.874 --> 11:03.007
then it's outta your way.

11:03.075 --> 11:04.542
Now, if you're in
roping competition,

11:04.610 --> 11:05.909
you'll probably wanna
dally it

11:05.977 --> 11:07.778
around the horn
a couple times.

11:07.846 --> 11:09.947
Okay, I've lined up
all the pre-pumped milk

11:10.014 --> 11:10.948
on the second shelf.

11:11.015 --> 11:12.449
And do not, I repeat,

11:12.516 --> 11:14.284
do not warm them up
in the microwave.

11:14.352 --> 11:15.786
Okay, I did that
like one time.

11:15.854 --> 11:17.221
And remember to check
the temperature on the...

11:17.288 --> 11:19.823
Inside of my wrist.
I've done this before.

11:19.891 --> 11:21.924
Okay, what else?

11:21.992 --> 11:23.092
Lotion.

11:24.461 --> 11:25.828
Katie:
(Cooing)

11:26.997 --> 11:28.464
Hello!

11:28.531 --> 11:29.832
Hi! Look who's awake.

11:30.801 --> 11:32.902
Look who's awake.
Muah!

11:32.970 --> 11:34.570
Okay.

11:34.638 --> 11:36.005
I just bought this.

11:36.073 --> 11:37.773
You need to use it
every time you change her.

11:37.840 --> 11:38.840
- Okay?
- Got it.

11:38.908 --> 11:40.876
- Really?
- What?

11:40.943 --> 11:42.110
Okay, I forget
sometimes.

11:42.178 --> 11:44.545
Well, don't.
She could get a rash.

11:44.613 --> 11:46.815
Uh, what else?
Oh! Here.

11:47.884 --> 11:49.517
Keep this stuffy
right here,

11:49.585 --> 11:51.820
where she can see it
all the time.

11:51.888 --> 11:52.821
Okay?

11:52.889 --> 11:55.156
<i>She just loves it.</i>

11:55.223 --> 11:56.556
They're ready to go.

11:56.624 --> 11:58.625
Oh my God, I can't believe
I'm leaving her.

11:58.693 --> 12:00.594
<i>Mallory: Come on, Lou, you've
left her a whole night before.</i>

12:00.662 --> 12:02.396
Yeah, but that was just
at the dude ranch.

12:02.463 --> 12:03.764
This time
I'm gonna be away.

12:03.832 --> 12:05.933
Like hours away.

12:06.001 --> 12:08.568
<i>Jack: She'll be in great
hands with Mallory,</i>

12:08.636 --> 12:10.136
<i>and I'll be here
to help her out.</i>

12:10.204 --> 12:11.938
So go have some fun.

12:13.740 --> 12:15.041
It's just a ride.

12:16.677 --> 12:17.743
Okay.

12:19.213 --> 12:20.780
Here you go.

12:22.183 --> 12:23.249
(Moans, reluctant)

12:24.819 --> 12:25.951
(Sighs)

12:31.057 --> 12:34.526
Tim: All right!
Let's hit the happy trail!

12:34.593 --> 12:36.461
Amy: (Laughs) See ya, guys.

12:36.529 --> 12:37.562
Mallory:
Bye.

12:39.833 --> 12:42.166
Lou: Mallory, remember,
before you give her a nap-

12:42.234 --> 12:43.367
read two books.

12:43.435 --> 12:44.969
Right.
And then you have to sing--

12:45.037 --> 12:46.871
"Twinkle, twinkle"
and "Bah bah black sheep."

12:46.939 --> 12:48.472
I know.

12:48.540 --> 12:49.506
Lou: Exactly.
But remember to put her in the crib

12:49.574 --> 12:51.042
before you start singing,

12:51.109 --> 12:53.244
because otherwise
she's just gonna wake up--

12:53.312 --> 12:54.946
You're too far away,
I can't hear you.

12:55.013 --> 12:56.914
Just nod your head,
Mallory.

12:56.982 --> 12:58.648
Just keep nodding.

12:59.550 --> 13:01.384
Lou: Oh-oh-oh!
And give her the pink soother,

13:01.452 --> 13:02.853
<i>and her blue kitty blanket.</i>

13:02.920 --> 13:06.323
<i>It's in the basket...
(Voice trails off)</i>

13:06.390 --> 13:08.191
Soraya: So what is this,
like the fifth day in a row?

13:08.259 --> 13:09.759
Amy told me you can cook.

13:09.827 --> 13:11.794
Yeah, but I like being
cooked for even better.

13:13.097 --> 13:15.564
Soraya, I need a coffee, quick,
and strong.

13:15.631 --> 13:17.199
Like rocketfuel strong.

13:17.267 --> 13:18.467
Special occasion?

13:18.534 --> 13:20.903
Yeah, I might be riding
my first bull today.

13:20.971 --> 13:22.071
Are you serious?

13:22.138 --> 13:23.438
Yes, I am.

13:23.506 --> 13:24.673
You know, you should
come out and watch.

13:26.142 --> 13:28.443
Shouldn't you be working
on the bathtub?

13:28.511 --> 13:29.711
I'm on it, man.
I got it.

13:29.779 --> 13:31.246
Thanks a lot.

13:32.181 --> 13:33.547
(Diner doors open)

13:33.615 --> 13:37.151
Long story.
Don't ask.

13:37.219 --> 13:39.287
So bulls...
that's pretty crazy.

13:39.355 --> 13:40.989
Yeah, that's 'cause
Caleb is crazy.

13:41.056 --> 13:43.157
Yeah, and reckless,
even for a cowboy.

13:43.225 --> 13:46.060
I mean, everything is
full throttle with that guy.

13:46.128 --> 13:47.461
He could really get hurt
out there.

13:47.529 --> 13:50.731
So, maybe you should,
you know, talk to him.

13:50.799 --> 13:52.199
Well, why don't you talk
to him?

13:52.267 --> 13:55.135
Because I don't want him
to get the wrong idea.

13:56.438 --> 13:57.471
I care about Caleb.

13:57.539 --> 14:00.107
I just don't...
"care" about Caleb,

14:00.174 --> 14:02.675
and... anyway,
I thought he'd listen

14:02.743 --> 14:04.010
to an ex-bull rider.

14:04.777 --> 14:05.745
More like a one time,

14:05.813 --> 14:08.347
three second
ex-bull-riding fool.

14:08.416 --> 14:10.316
<i>Austin: (Yelling loudly) Soraya!</i>

14:10.384 --> 14:11.684
Toilet's overflowing again

14:11.752 --> 14:12.719
and the floor's like
totally covered in--

14:12.787 --> 14:14.487
Thank you, Austin.
Come here!

14:16.323 --> 14:17.724
Come here faster.

14:17.792 --> 14:21.493
Next time that happens,
use your indoor voice.

14:21.561 --> 14:22.628
10-4.

14:25.698 --> 14:26.765
Sorry.

14:28.167 --> 14:29.234
(Clears throat)

14:32.906 --> 14:34.906
(Stream babbles loudly,
birds chirp)

14:34.973 --> 14:36.707
(Horses whinny)

14:36.775 --> 14:38.175

and whinnies)

14:53.858 --> 14:55.258
<i>Amy:
Hey, Shane, you okay?</i>

14:55.326 --> 14:56.392
<i>Shane:
Yeah.</i>

14:57.628 --> 14:59.028
Lou:
Whoa! Easy, boy.

15:05.402 --> 15:07.202
Tim:
Great view, huh?

15:15.479 --> 15:16.645
<i>Waylon:
You're up, Caleb.</i>

15:16.713 --> 15:18.347
<i>Chad:
Let's see what you got.</i>

15:18.414 --> 15:20.248
<i>Waylon:
Come on.</i>

15:21.184 --> 15:22.384
Come on,
stay over top of the rope!

15:22.452 --> 15:23.885
Waylon:
Let's see what you got!

15:23.953 --> 15:25.386
Chad: You got to hang
on with your feet!

15:25.454 --> 15:26.521
(Grunts)

15:27.723 --> 15:29.323
Wow. Impressive.

15:29.391 --> 15:30.959
Almost four seconds
that time.

15:31.026 --> 15:33.895
Caleb: Yeah, well, I've never
been much for barrels.

15:33.963 --> 15:35.897
I'd rather just try
the real thing.

15:35.965 --> 15:37.799
Sorry, man, not yet.

15:37.867 --> 15:39.299
All right.

15:39.367 --> 15:41.001
You need to quit spurring
like you're on a bronc.

15:41.068 --> 15:42.736
Okay, no spurring.

15:43.671 --> 15:44.938
So has Ty figured it out yet?

15:45.006 --> 15:46.607
You just brought it
to him yesterday.

15:46.674 --> 15:49.109
Yeah, well, I leave
for the rodeo tomorrow.

15:49.176 --> 15:50.777
We better do a drop-by.

15:51.713 --> 15:53.614
Sure. But you gotta
buck me off first.

15:57.150 --> 15:58.283
Waylon:
Deal.

15:59.853 --> 16:02.421
(Barrel clanks loudly)
Cowboys: Whoa!

16:02.489 --> 16:04.957
(Caleb grunts,
cowboys laugh)

16:09.195 --> 16:10.762
Yeah, pretty funny.

16:11.463 --> 16:14.533
<i>Lou: Thank God we made
it over that Ridge.</i>

16:14.600 --> 16:15.800
Tim:
Oh, come on,

16:15.868 --> 16:16.868
we used to come up here
all the time.

16:16.936 --> 16:18.369
Family rides,
remember?

16:18.437 --> 16:20.872
Lou: That's why I was
having serious deja vu.

16:20.940 --> 16:23.174
That's where you told me
that crazy story

16:23.242 --> 16:24.409
about a guy getting mauled
by a bear.

16:24.476 --> 16:25.710
That's a true story.

16:25.778 --> 16:27.578
Yeah, it scared me
out of my wits.

16:27.646 --> 16:29.079
You remember that,
Amy?

16:29.147 --> 16:31.815
Amy: What? No. I...
I don't think so.

16:31.883 --> 16:35.285
(Stammers)
Do you remember that view?

16:35.353 --> 16:37.254
Well, that would've been
a pretty dangerous Ridge

16:37.321 --> 16:39.289
for a five-year-old, Dad.

16:39.357 --> 16:40.925
Yeah.

16:40.992 --> 16:43.125
<i>Yeah, I guess it probably was
before your time.</i>

16:43.193 --> 16:44.961
<i>Lou: Okay, we're way
behind schedule.</i>

16:45.029 --> 16:46.228
Maybe we should
just start heading back

16:46.296 --> 16:47.664
before we start
losing light.

16:47.731 --> 16:48.798
No, we're almost there.

16:48.866 --> 16:50.433
It's just up
over the rise.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.001
That's what you said the last
10 times we came over a Ridge,

16:52.069 --> 16:53.402
<i>or around a bend,
or--</i>

16:53.470 --> 16:55.137
Admit it, we're lost.
I knew this would happen.

16:55.205 --> 16:57.874
You know, just like all
of those family trips.

16:57.942 --> 16:59.174
<i>We would spend the whole day</i>

16:59.241 --> 17:00.776
<i>looking for some stupid
army fort,</i>

17:00.843 --> 17:02.110
<i>or a gopher museum,</i>

17:02.178 --> 17:04.046
or that town statue
of two giant potatoes

17:04.113 --> 17:06.181
dressed up like farmers.

17:06.248 --> 17:07.950
Hey! Look at this!

17:08.851 --> 17:10.685
Oh, just over the rise?

17:13.021 --> 17:15.890
Now this is cool.
(Clucks tongue)

17:15.958 --> 17:17.058
Tim:
"Cool." Ha!

17:20.996 --> 17:23.064
(Galloping hoof beats)

17:43.862 --> 17:45.030
<i>Tim:
(Chuckles)</i>

17:45.097 --> 17:46.097
Shane:
Come on, Amy! Let's go.

17:46.165 --> 17:47.732
Amy:
(Laughs)

17:47.800 --> 17:49.167
Tim:
Yeah, you guys go ahead.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.968
I'll get the horses.

17:55.506 --> 17:58.075
Hey, there's a jail in there.

17:58.977 --> 18:00.077
(Half laughs)

18:05.083 --> 18:08.184
Dammit.
There's no reception, Dad.

18:08.252 --> 18:09.852
If anything happens
to Katie...

18:09.920 --> 18:12.721
Okay, calm down.
You can use my phone.

18:12.789 --> 18:15.691
That archaic flip phone
you refuse to upgrade.

18:15.759 --> 18:16.892
I'm sure it works
just great out here

18:16.961 --> 18:18.127
in the middle of nowhere.

18:18.195 --> 18:21.030
It may not look pretty,
but I have bars...

18:21.098 --> 18:22.798
I have... a bar.

18:24.067 --> 18:25.067
(Phone beeps)

18:25.134 --> 18:26.668
Okay, come on,
be quick.

18:26.735 --> 18:28.236
Okay, this is like
a family trip...

18:28.304 --> 18:30.038
Yes. One second.

18:30.106 --> 18:31.173
Okay.

18:32.741 --> 18:33.808
Mallory.

18:35.144 --> 18:36.778
Are you there?

18:36.846 --> 18:38.313
I can't hear you.

18:39.614 --> 18:40.814
Okay,
now I can hear you.

18:40.882 --> 18:41.983
How's Katie?

18:43.251 --> 18:44.585
Mallory?
Hello?

18:45.787 --> 18:47.054
Dammit.

18:47.122 --> 18:48.189
(Moans)

19:03.604 --> 19:04.670
(Door creaks open)

19:10.811 --> 19:11.843
Yes! Bars.

19:13.380 --> 19:14.446
(Sighs)

19:15.615 --> 19:17.182
Mallory!
Oh! Thank God.

19:18.084 --> 19:20.685
Okay, how's Katie?
(Lost call tone beeps)

19:20.753 --> 19:22.187
Mallory?

19:22.255 --> 19:23.688
Mallory?

19:23.756 --> 19:25.024
(Exasperated sigh)

19:25.091 --> 19:26.825
(Wrench cranks)

19:26.893 --> 19:28.726
Ty: Just putting on
some new spark plugs.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.561
I found a way to get ram air
through the carb.

19:30.629 --> 19:33.031
Waylon:
Will she make the jump?

19:33.098 --> 19:34.499
Ty: (Sighs, reluctant)
I don't know, man.

19:34.566 --> 19:35.799
I don't think
it's gonna happen.

19:35.867 --> 19:37.168
It's not really built
for that kind of thing,

19:37.236 --> 19:38.936
- you know? - Yeah, well
people say pigs can't fly,

19:39.004 --> 19:40.671
but I used to do this bit
with a cannon

19:40.739 --> 19:42.106
and a vietnamese pot belly

19:42.174 --> 19:43.973
that proves,
with sufficient thrust,

19:44.042 --> 19:46.043
pig'll fly just fine.

19:46.110 --> 19:47.744
(Laughs) You know, I could
put a straight pipe

19:47.811 --> 19:49.279
on the exhaust,

19:49.347 --> 19:51.248
but then your engine's gonna
sound like a chainsaw.

19:51.315 --> 19:52.482
Hang on.
Are you telling me

19:52.550 --> 19:54.351
that you can make this
faster and louder?

19:54.419 --> 19:56.119
Slap on the damn pipe.

19:56.187 --> 19:57.254
(Waylon's phone rings)

19:57.321 --> 19:58.388
I gotta take this.

19:59.322 --> 20:00.489
Hey, Dougie.

20:00.557 --> 20:01.623
Yeah, I'm working
on a new gag.

20:01.691 --> 20:02.658
Here's what I need:

20:02.725 --> 20:04.527
A speedo, tar,
feathers,

20:04.594 --> 20:06.362
<i>an exploding cigar
and a trained chimp,</i>

20:06.430 --> 20:08.830
<i>one that don't scare easy.</i>

20:08.898 --> 20:11.167
(Half laughs)
Is this guy for real?

20:11.234 --> 20:13.135
He's a rodeo clown,
man.

20:13.203 --> 20:14.437
They're a...
they're a special breed,

20:14.504 --> 20:17.004
but they're a bull rider's
best friend, so...

20:17.073 --> 20:18.239
Hey, I gotta ask, man,

20:18.307 --> 20:20.475
this sudden interest
in bulls...

20:20.543 --> 20:22.177
Has it got anything
to do with Ashley?

20:22.244 --> 20:24.579
Yeah, 'cause I'm the first idiot
to jump on a bull

20:24.646 --> 20:26.481
to impress a girl.

20:26.549 --> 20:28.383
Yeah.

20:28.451 --> 20:30.785
But, yes,
Ashley would hate the idea.

20:30.852 --> 20:33.153
It'd make her crazy.
Hell, if she found out,

20:33.221 --> 20:34.354
she'd probably drive
all the way back

20:34.422 --> 20:36.490
just to wring my neck.
So trust me,

20:36.558 --> 20:38.792
this has nothing
to do with Ashley.

20:38.859 --> 20:39.926
Okay.

20:47.901 --> 20:50.369
Oh my gosh,
she's driving me nuts.

20:50.437 --> 20:51.337
The baby?

20:51.405 --> 20:52.338
No. Lou.

20:52.406 --> 20:53.473
She can't even get reception

20:53.540 --> 20:54.807
and she's still trying
to call me.

20:54.874 --> 20:56.275
I mean,
where's the trust?

20:56.343 --> 20:59.378
She wouldn't have gone
if she didn't trust you.

20:59.446 --> 21:03.415
And that's why she's on me
for every little mistake?

21:03.483 --> 21:05.250
Not that I'm making any.

21:05.318 --> 21:07.486
Even if I was,
which I'm totally not,

21:07.553 --> 21:10.088
how would she even know
that I'm messing up?

21:10.156 --> 21:11.223
(Phone rings)

21:13.593 --> 21:17.295
Well, why don't you
ask her yourself.

21:18.431 --> 21:19.763
Hey, Lou.

21:20.932 --> 21:23.066
Still no reception.

21:24.068 --> 21:25.736
Okay. Lou?

21:25.803 --> 21:28.272
If you can hear me,
everything's good here.

21:28.340 --> 21:29.640
Katie's just waking up.

21:29.707 --> 21:31.008
What did you say?

21:31.075 --> 21:32.943
She's throwing up?

21:33.011 --> 21:34.378
Katie's sick?

21:34.446 --> 21:36.179
Mallory?

21:36.247 --> 21:37.180
Mallory!

21:37.248 --> 21:39.382
I'm losing you again.

21:39.450 --> 21:41.050
Really, really bad
connection.

21:41.118 --> 21:42.519
What's really bad?

21:42.586 --> 21:44.086
Does she have a fever?

21:44.155 --> 21:46.322
Oh my God,
she has a fever doesn't she?

21:46.390 --> 21:47.524
Okay, Mallory,

21:47.591 --> 21:49.725
you need to run
a lukewarm bath.

21:49.793 --> 21:51.793
Okay? Mallory!

21:51.861 --> 21:54.329
(Lost call tone beeps)
Ugh! Mallory?

21:54.397 --> 21:55.063
(Sighs)

21:57.534 --> 22:00.169
What, is that old back injury
acting up, Dad?

22:00.236 --> 22:02.137
<i>Tim: No.
No, no, I'm just a little stiff.</i>

22:02.205 --> 22:05.006
Well, no wonder,
after that ride today.

22:05.074 --> 22:06.441
Shane:
Whoa!

22:06.509 --> 22:10.411
The bars on this window's
really made of iron.

22:11.480 --> 22:13.113
They sure are.

22:13.182 --> 22:15.115
<i>I bet you wish you hadn't
robbed that stagecoach now,</i>

22:15.184 --> 22:16.617
<i>huh, fella?</i>

22:16.685 --> 22:19.420
<i>Not my jurisdiction.
So, cool your heels.</i>

22:19.488 --> 22:21.989
Uh... that sounded like
it actually locked.

22:22.057 --> 22:24.457
Sure did.
He's been incarcerated.

22:24.525 --> 22:25.892
(Door rattles)

22:25.959 --> 22:27.860
No, no,
I think it is.

22:27.928 --> 22:29.629
Trust me, it's not locked,
you guys.

22:29.697 --> 22:30.797
Amy:
Dad.

22:32.400 --> 22:33.766
(Door rattles)

22:33.834 --> 22:35.235
Dad.

22:35.303 --> 22:36.769
It's actually locked.

22:36.837 --> 22:38.738
It's probably just stuck.
Get outta the way.

22:38.806 --> 22:40.606
(Amy sighs, annoyed)

22:41.541 --> 22:43.141
(Grunts of effort)

22:43.210 --> 22:44.142
Ungh!

22:44.211 --> 22:45.143
Agh!

22:45.212 --> 22:46.878
(Grunts and groans in pain)

22:47.847 --> 22:48.847
Dad,
what did you do?

22:48.915 --> 22:50.482
Dad:
Oh! My bad shoulder.

22:50.550 --> 22:51.750
He locked me
in here.

22:51.818 --> 22:52.884
You did what?

22:52.952 --> 22:55.353
I didn't do it on purpose.

22:55.421 --> 22:56.954
Okay, keys.
Let's look for the keys.

22:57.022 --> 22:58.690
They must be around here
somewhere

22:58.757 --> 23:00.558
hanging from a hook.

23:00.626 --> 23:01.459
<i>Tim: Oh yeah, I'm sure
there's an extra set of keys</i>

23:01.527 --> 23:02.627
lying around here somewhere.

23:02.695 --> 23:03.961
Well, great.

23:04.029 --> 23:04.929
How're we supposed
to get him out then?

23:04.996 --> 23:05.930
My God, Dad,
what did you do?

23:05.997 --> 23:07.498
I was trying to have
a little fun.

23:09.602 --> 23:11.401
Just calm down.

23:13.070 --> 23:15.839
I'm really stuck
in here?

23:20.144 --> 23:21.845
Not for long.

23:22.780 --> 23:24.848
<i>Lou: Dad, come on.
This is crazy.</i>

23:24.915 --> 23:27.183
Yeah. So crazy
it just might work.

23:27.251 --> 23:28.718
Amy:
Or it just might not.

23:28.785 --> 23:30.253
Oh, it's been done
in dozens of westerns.

23:30.320 --> 23:32.288
Lou: Yeah, with stunt
guys and fake bars,

23:32.356 --> 23:35.057
<i>and, Dad,
we have to get home.</i>

23:35.125 --> 23:36.825
<i>Tim:
It's gonna work.</i>

23:36.893 --> 23:38.994
Tim: Here we go.
Shane: Wait! Don't do it.

23:39.062 --> 23:40.095
Don't worry, I'm gonna get you
outta there, little buddy.

23:40.163 --> 23:41.997
No. Seriously, stop!

23:42.065 --> 23:43.798
Shane, stand back
from the window.

23:43.866 --> 23:44.966
H'yah! Ha!

23:46.669 --> 23:48.303
(Horse whinnes,
Tim groans in pain)

23:48.371 --> 23:51.005
Amy: Dad!
Lou: Are you okay?

23:51.073 --> 23:53.007
Lou: Are you all right?
Tim: Yes, I'm fine.

23:53.075 --> 23:55.644
Tweaked the knee a bit
there.

23:55.711 --> 23:57.445
Shane,
how did you get out?

23:57.513 --> 23:58.846
The keys.

23:58.914 --> 24:00.281
They were under the mattress
in the cell.

24:00.348 --> 24:01.548
Why didn't you tell me?

24:01.616 --> 24:04.385
I did.
I said stop, twice.

24:07.755 --> 24:09.021
Oh...

24:09.923 --> 24:12.258
So it sounds like Caleb's
going through with it,

24:12.326 --> 24:13.626
and he made a special point
of telling me

24:13.694 --> 24:15.060
it has nothing to do
with Ashley.

24:15.128 --> 24:16.396
So in other words...

24:16.463 --> 24:18.164
It has everything
to do with Ashley.

24:18.231 --> 24:19.265
<i>Austin:
Excuse us.</i>

24:21.001 --> 24:22.535
(Toilet thuds onto floor)

24:22.603 --> 24:23.602
Your toilet's installed.

24:23.670 --> 24:24.569
Where do you want
the old one?

24:24.637 --> 24:26.171
Uh, not here.

24:26.238 --> 24:28.640
Take it out back,
now!

24:39.785 --> 24:41.519
(Cooing)

24:41.586 --> 24:43.020
<i>Mallory: Here you go, Katie.
A nice clean diaper.</i>

24:43.087 --> 24:45.389
No wedgie,
lots of lotion.

24:45.457 --> 24:48.091
Your auntie Mallory
learns quick, doesn't she?

24:48.159 --> 24:49.660
Can you say "auntie"?

24:49.728 --> 24:51.662
(Cooing)

24:51.730 --> 24:53.263
You're a ticklish little one,
aren't you?

24:53.332 --> 24:54.432
You got ticklish feet?

24:54.499 --> 24:56.566
(Katie giggles)

24:57.768 --> 24:59.068
Do you want your doggy?

24:59.136 --> 25:01.037
Are you sure want him?

25:03.341 --> 25:05.908
He might wanna
tickle you too.

25:20.590 --> 25:21.824
What's the matter?
Is it Katie?

25:21.891 --> 25:24.493
No, she's fine.
It's this.

25:24.561 --> 25:26.362
You still think
Lou trusts me?

25:26.429 --> 25:28.596
I don't get
what a mutt in coveralls

25:28.664 --> 25:32.166
- has to do with trust?
- This a lens.

25:32.234 --> 25:34.101
This is a camera.

25:34.169 --> 25:37.137
This is a video card.
It's a nanny-cam.

25:37.205 --> 25:38.673
A nanny-what?

25:38.741 --> 25:40.775
It's for spying, Jack,
on me!

25:44.979 --> 25:46.246
Okay,
that should hold.

25:46.313 --> 25:48.214
All right,
let's go.

25:48.282 --> 25:51.050
Come on. Lou, where's Shane?

25:51.118 --> 25:52.619
Dammit!
Someone's gotta find him.

25:52.687 --> 25:54.921
I gotta get home.
Katie's sick, I think.

25:54.989 --> 25:56.390
Well, we are losing
the light.

25:56.457 --> 25:57.557
Come on, Dad.

25:57.625 --> 25:58.992
But you can't even
get up.

25:59.059 --> 26:00.292
Dad, how are you
gonna ride?

26:00.360 --> 26:02.261
I'll suck it up.
Yeah, he'll suck it up.

26:02.328 --> 26:03.829
Even if you manage
to get on the horse,

26:03.897 --> 26:05.531
<i>it's gonna take us
twice as long to ride back.</i>

26:05.599 --> 26:07.767
<i>And on that trail?
Come on.</i>

26:07.834 --> 26:09.268
Amy, please don't
tell me...

26:09.836 --> 26:13.171
Lou, we're not gonna make it
home before sunset.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.507
We're stuck here
for the night.

26:15.441 --> 26:16.674
Ugh! Damn!

26:23.404 --> 26:27.274
<i>Lou: I said we're staying
the night, Grampa.</i>

26:27.342 --> 26:28.742
Yeah.

26:29.677 --> 26:33.380
Would you just put Mallory
on the phone please?

26:33.448 --> 26:35.248
She won't come to the phone?
Why?

26:35.316 --> 26:38.084
(Lost call tone beeps)
Grampa?

26:38.152 --> 26:39.585
Hello?

26:39.653 --> 26:41.154
(Lou sighs, frustrated)

26:41.856 --> 26:43.289
Shane: Wouldn't it just
be easier to text them?

26:43.357 --> 26:44.523
Lou:
Yeah, you'd think,

26:44.591 --> 26:47.460
except my dad's too cheap
to pay for text.

26:48.428 --> 26:52.297
Shane: So were all your
family trips this lame?

26:52.365 --> 26:54.566
You really don't get it,
do you?

26:54.633 --> 26:55.834
What do you mean?

26:55.902 --> 26:57.569
Why do you think
we came out here?

26:57.636 --> 26:59.571
I don't know.

26:59.638 --> 27:01.373
Hey, I didn't ask
for any of this.

27:01.440 --> 27:03.876
My dad just wants
to impress you, okay?

27:03.943 --> 27:05.143
So maybe you could lose
the whole

27:05.211 --> 27:06.778
too-cool-for-school
attitude

27:06.846 --> 27:08.746
and give him a chance.

27:08.813 --> 27:10.114
I mean, if you didn't wanna
be around him,

27:10.182 --> 27:12.016
why did you come out here
for the summer?

27:12.084 --> 27:14.418
Because my mom works
all the time,

27:14.486 --> 27:17.288
and we move around a lot,
so...

27:17.356 --> 27:18.289
I guess I thought
it'd be better

27:18.357 --> 27:20.992
than spending it
by myself.

27:25.596 --> 27:26.997
(Groans in pain)

27:29.100 --> 27:30.566
Oh, good,
you found some.

27:31.835 --> 27:33.169
(Wood clatters)

27:35.006 --> 27:37.607
So what's your secret?

27:37.674 --> 27:39.541
What secret?

27:39.609 --> 27:40.542
Why do you get along
with Shane

27:40.610 --> 27:41.843
so much better than I do?

27:43.213 --> 27:45.447
Well, there is no secret,
Dad.

27:45.515 --> 27:48.583
It's not as complicated
for us.

27:48.651 --> 27:49.618
He was surprised
to find out

27:49.685 --> 27:50.652
that he had a sister,

27:50.720 --> 27:52.254
but he's known
his whole life

27:52.322 --> 27:55.957
that his dad was out there
somewhere.

27:56.025 --> 27:58.559
Well, you'd think he'd be happy
when he finally found him.

27:58.627 --> 27:59.860
He's had a long time
to dream up

27:59.929 --> 28:02.630
what his dad was really
gonna be like.

28:02.697 --> 28:04.933
He probably had
a lot of expectations.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.500
(Wounded) Oh.

28:06.568 --> 28:09.237
So the reality doesn't
stack up to the fantasy.

28:10.406 --> 28:12.205
No.

28:12.273 --> 28:14.841
Dad, it's not like that.

28:16.877 --> 28:18.011
It's just...

28:19.414 --> 28:22.582
It's gonna take some time
to adjust,

28:22.650 --> 28:25.352
and I guess I can relate

28:26.754 --> 28:28.287
'cause I don't have
Lou's memories of you

28:28.355 --> 28:30.756
when I was growing up,

28:30.824 --> 28:33.092
and...

28:33.160 --> 28:35.027
When I was Shane's age,
I was still dreaming

28:35.095 --> 28:37.229
about what my dad
was really like.

28:54.780 --> 28:56.147
Hey, Caleb,
you wanna give me a hand?

28:57.083 --> 28:58.450
Caleb:
(Sighs) Okay.

28:58.517 --> 29:00.384
I got a tub
in my truck.

29:00.452 --> 29:01.952
Is Waylon gonna be
happy?

29:02.020 --> 29:03.387
How fast does it go?

29:03.455 --> 29:04.955
Fast enough.

29:05.023 --> 29:06.323
All right.

29:07.158 --> 29:10.594
Caleb and Ty:
(Excited) Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!

29:14.032 --> 29:17.000
(Tub rumbles,
Caleb and Ty laugh)

29:17.067 --> 29:18.468
Caleb:
Woo-hoo!

29:18.535 --> 29:19.635
Yeah!

29:21.972 --> 29:23.906
Ty:
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

29:23.974 --> 29:25.808
(Laughing)

29:27.411 --> 29:28.744
So, what'd you think?

29:28.812 --> 29:30.546
I think it's awesome.
I know, eh?

29:30.614 --> 29:32.347
And I think it's my turn.

29:32.415 --> 29:33.681
Oh, I don't know,
man.

29:33.749 --> 29:34.883
The steering's pretty tough
on this guy, so...

29:34.950 --> 29:37.085
Oh yeah,
'cause you're some kinda

29:37.153 --> 29:39.854
bathtub driving professional.

29:39.922 --> 29:40.989
Come on...

29:41.057 --> 29:42.424
Ty:
I don't know.

29:42.492 --> 29:45.894
Caleb and Ty:
(Excited whoops and laughter)

29:47.062 --> 29:48.262
Woooo-hoo-hoo!

29:49.197 --> 29:50.664
Here we go!

29:50.732 --> 29:52.500
Woo-hoo-woo!
Yeah!

29:52.567 --> 29:53.700
(Laughter)

29:53.768 --> 29:54.968
Easy, easy! The brake!
The brake!

29:55.037 --> 29:56.404
Caleb: What?
Ty: The brake! Pull the brake!

29:56.471 --> 29:57.638
Caleb:
I know! I'm doing great!

29:57.705 --> 29:58.805
Ty:
No! Agggghhhhh!

30:00.942 --> 30:02.209
(Loud crash)

30:06.180 --> 30:08.014
Caleb and Ty:
(Grunting and groaning)

30:11.652 --> 30:14.987
Caleb:
(Grunts and moans)

30:16.156 --> 30:18.223
(Tub hisses)

30:20.594 --> 30:23.195
Waylon's gonna
kill you.

30:28.568 --> 30:29.634
(Fire crackles)

30:30.903 --> 30:32.070
You gonna be okay

30:32.137 --> 30:33.605
looking after the baby
all night?

30:33.673 --> 30:35.173
<i>Mallory: Yeah.
But this is the last time.</i>

30:35.240 --> 30:38.276
I'm not babysitting for Lou
anymore.

30:39.946 --> 30:42.313
Katie's sure gonna
miss you.

30:42.381 --> 30:46.650
I'll come visit her,
but not when Lou's around.

30:46.718 --> 30:48.385
Maybe you oughta
just talk to Lou

30:48.453 --> 30:50.854
before you make
any rash decisions.

30:50.922 --> 30:52.322
You two have had
your moments,

30:52.390 --> 30:54.625
but you've always been
very close.

30:54.693 --> 30:57.595
Yeah,
that's what I thought.

31:02.499 --> 31:06.235
(Coyote howls, owl hoots,
crickets chirp)

31:07.170 --> 31:09.205
Lou: I had reception
like two minutes ago.

31:09.272 --> 31:10.406
This is maddening!

31:10.474 --> 31:12.174
Yeah, tell me about it.
Can I try?

31:12.242 --> 31:13.943
Lou:
Yeah. Good luck.

31:15.244 --> 31:16.645
Lou:
Amy, what're you doing?

31:16.713 --> 31:19.280
Amy: Oh, just consider
this an intervention.

31:19.348 --> 31:20.782
Lou:
Give it back.

31:20.850 --> 31:22.217
Amy: No, Lou.
You know you can't get through.

31:22.284 --> 31:23.351
Lou:
Amy, give it back.

31:23.419 --> 31:24.419
<i>Amy:
Katie is fine.</i>

31:24.487 --> 31:27.055
She is with Mallory
and grampa.

31:27.123 --> 31:28.423
Lou:
Give it back.

31:28.491 --> 31:29.190
Amy: Lou, I will put
it in the fire.

31:29.258 --> 31:31.325
You two, please stop!

31:31.392 --> 31:33.661
It's supposed to be
a fun family outing!

31:33.729 --> 31:35.029
Lou: Oh yeah, Dad?
What part was that?

31:35.097 --> 31:36.363
Oh, oh, pardon me

31:36.431 --> 31:37.564
for wanting to go on a trip
with my three kids

31:37.633 --> 31:39.867
for the first time ever.

31:39.935 --> 31:41.035
<i>You know, I thought
it would be a big deal,</i>

31:41.103 --> 31:42.837
<i>but I guess...</i>

31:42.904 --> 31:44.471
Guess I'm the only one
who thought that.

31:47.508 --> 31:50.610
<i>(Coyote cries
in the distance)</i>

31:50.678 --> 31:51.945
What was that?

31:52.013 --> 31:54.380
Coyote.
They rarely eat people.

31:56.350 --> 31:58.451
No, I think just saw
something outside.

31:58.519 --> 31:59.719
<i>Tim: It's the
light from the fire,</i>

31:59.787 --> 32:00.687
it's playing tricks
with your eyes.

32:00.755 --> 32:01.721
I heard something.

32:01.789 --> 32:03.355
<i>(Horses whinny outside)</i>

32:03.422 --> 32:04.422
I think the horses...

32:04.490 --> 32:06.158
<i>(Horses whinny)</i>

32:06.225 --> 32:08.527
Oh yes, of course,

32:09.462 --> 32:12.397
because horses detect
a presence...

32:14.934 --> 32:17.202
Like the ghost
of Digger Mckee.

32:17.270 --> 32:19.537
Who's Digger Mckee?

32:19.604 --> 32:22.740
The guy who got mauled
by a bear.

32:22.808 --> 32:24.142
Here we go.

32:25.010 --> 32:26.510
You know, they say
that just before he died,

32:26.578 --> 32:28.012
he shot the bear,

32:28.080 --> 32:31.215
and they both bit the dust
at exactly the same moment.

32:31.283 --> 32:32.917
(Footsteps thump
on the verandah)

32:33.952 --> 32:35.052
Amy:
Dad...

32:36.054 --> 32:39.589
And their souls
became intertwined.

32:40.524 --> 32:42.025
Lou:
Dad...

32:42.093 --> 32:46.063
Tim: So amongst us walks a
spirit who is half man,

32:46.130 --> 32:47.263
half beast...

32:47.331 --> 32:49.066
- Dad!
- Aw, you just called me--

32:49.133 --> 32:50.300
Agghhhh!

32:50.367 --> 32:52.201
(Groans in pain)

32:54.771 --> 32:56.706
What the hell are you
doing here?

32:56.773 --> 32:59.308
This is private property.

33:00.243 --> 33:01.177
Are you okay, buddy?

33:01.244 --> 33:02.344
No.

33:03.914 --> 33:05.214
What's the matter
with you guys?

33:05.281 --> 33:06.281
You look like you've seen
a ghost or something.

33:07.216 --> 33:08.382
<i>Tim:
That would be you.</i>

33:08.450 --> 33:11.186
What? I'm the caretaker
of this set.

33:12.988 --> 33:15.690
I saw the saloon lit up
from my place up on the hill.

33:15.758 --> 33:16.758
I thought you were
a bunch of teenagers

33:16.826 --> 33:18.126
having another party
down here.

33:18.194 --> 33:19.627
I'm sorry,
we're trespassing.

33:19.695 --> 33:21.329
We're gonna be outta here
first thing in the morning.

33:21.396 --> 33:23.396
Bearded man:
This ain't a campground.

33:23.464 --> 33:24.732
Well, I'm a little
racked up here.

33:24.799 --> 33:26.366
Yeah, and we only had
a couple of hours

33:26.434 --> 33:27.467
until sunset.

33:27.535 --> 33:29.502
And we live all the way
in Hudson.

33:29.570 --> 33:31.538
Hudson? It's only an hour
and a half from here.

33:32.974 --> 33:34.374
Trust me, it's not.

33:34.442 --> 33:37.377
Well, it is
if you take the Flats.

33:37.445 --> 33:38.845
You didn't come by...

33:39.847 --> 33:41.047
<i>(Laughs)</i>

33:42.116 --> 33:44.250
You came by Cook's Pass?
(Laughing hard)

33:45.418 --> 33:47.720
<i>It's lucky you got here
in one piece.</i>

33:47.788 --> 33:48.855
(Laughing)

33:50.590 --> 33:51.390
Thanks for checking in.

33:51.458 --> 33:52.524
(Laughing)

33:55.162 --> 33:58.063
(Forced chuckle,
sighs, defeated)

34:03.701 --> 34:04.834
<i>Lou:
'Morning!</i>

34:05.769 --> 34:08.603
Okay, sleepyheads, sun's up!
Come on!

34:08.670 --> 34:10.405
(Clanks can)

34:10.473 --> 34:11.706
Let's hit the road.

34:11.774 --> 34:12.940
(Groans)

34:13.842 --> 34:14.743
How's your knee?

34:14.810 --> 34:15.877
(Groans)

34:17.112 --> 34:18.447
It's pretty swollen.

34:18.514 --> 34:19.648
Can you ride?

34:19.716 --> 34:21.014
I don't know.

34:21.083 --> 34:22.751
So what, we have to get you
airlifted out of here?

34:22.818 --> 34:25.652
No, I'm not calling in
some rescue team

34:25.721 --> 34:26.853
for a bum knee.

34:26.920 --> 34:29.188
So what, you gonna hop home
on one leg?

34:29.257 --> 34:30.324
(Groaning)

34:31.793 --> 34:33.193
Hey, I've got an idea.

34:33.262 --> 34:34.228
There's this whole pile
of wood

34:34.295 --> 34:35.529
over by the blacksmith's.

34:35.597 --> 34:36.664
I'm gonna need some help.

34:42.136 --> 34:43.202
(Groans)

34:49.777 --> 34:52.110
Will you sit down?
You're making me nervous.

34:52.179 --> 34:56.681
I'm going over everything
I have to say to Lou.

34:56.750 --> 34:59.017
I'm afraid I'm gonna clam up
when we're face-to-face.

34:59.085 --> 35:02.053
Since when do you have trouble
expressing yourself?

35:02.121 --> 35:03.955
When I'm this upset.

35:04.891 --> 35:06.325
Maybe I should
just send an email.

35:06.393 --> 35:08.527
No.
No, that's not the way

35:08.595 --> 35:11.363
to deal with
something like this.

35:11.431 --> 35:12.730
Whatever words you choose,

35:12.798 --> 35:14.499
Lou needs to hear 'em
come outta your mouth.

35:16.335 --> 35:17.802
Ty:
Hey, guys.

35:17.869 --> 35:19.970
Um, sorry, to break up
your breakfast there, Jack,

35:20.038 --> 35:21.639
but I could really use
your help.

35:21.707 --> 35:23.207
Everything okay?

35:23.275 --> 35:25.075
Yeah, I just need to rebuild
something really quickly,

35:25.143 --> 35:26.611
and I could use
an extra pair of hands.

35:26.679 --> 35:28.112
Oh, sure. I can give you
a couple of hours.

35:28.180 --> 35:29.245
What're we rebuilding?

35:31.882 --> 35:33.216
(Gate crashes open)

35:36.721 --> 35:37.754
(Bull snorts)

35:50.066 --> 35:52.501
<i>Chad:
All right, Caleb, you ready?</i>

35:52.569 --> 35:53.636
<i>You got that?</i>

35:54.671 --> 35:56.071
<i>All right?</i>

36:03.579 --> 36:04.713
<i>Guy:
Hey, Caleb, easy...</i>

36:04.780 --> 36:07.081
(Rope rasps loudly)

36:07.149 --> 36:09.283
(Bull snorts heavily)

36:09.352 --> 36:10.652
(Rope whips through the air)

36:13.021 --> 36:14.556
<i>Chad: It's tied down.
Okay, we're all set.</i>

36:24.331 --> 36:26.031
(Gate bursts open,
bull grunts loudly)

36:26.099 --> 36:27.500
Waylon: (Unclear) In your feet!
(Unclear) In your feet!

36:28.469 --> 36:30.570
Cowboys:
(Encouraging shouts)

36:30.637 --> 36:32.405
Waylon: Stay over your rope!
Stay over your rope!

36:33.340 --> 36:34.273
Hey, bull!

36:34.341 --> 36:35.975
(Bull grunts wildly)

36:36.543 --> 36:39.411
Waylon: Hey, bull! Hey, bull!
Hey, bull! Hey, bull!

36:39.479 --> 36:41.713
<i>H'yah! I got him!</i>

36:41.781 --> 36:44.015
See you, bull!
Get outta here.

36:44.950 --> 36:46.852
(Laughs)
That was awesome!

36:46.919 --> 36:48.052
Are you okay?

36:48.120 --> 36:49.320
Yeah!

36:49.389 --> 36:50.856
You know how people
say your crazy?

36:50.923 --> 36:51.923
Well, you're not.
You're--

36:51.991 --> 36:53.692
- Fearless?
- No, that's not it.

36:53.760 --> 36:55.426
- Super talented.
- I was gonna say--

36:55.494 --> 36:57.060
- Amazing.
- Pathetic.

36:57.128 --> 36:59.496
Caleb, you are doing this
for the attention of someone

36:59.563 --> 37:00.998
who's so wrapped up
in herself,

37:01.065 --> 37:03.000
she's not even gonna notice.

37:03.067 --> 37:05.669
This has nothing
to do with Ashley.

37:05.737 --> 37:09.139
Okay. Just...
Just don't hurt yourself.

37:09.207 --> 37:10.641
Don't go breaking
anything,

37:10.709 --> 37:13.543
especially that big heart
of yours.

37:15.679 --> 37:17.414
Not bad
for a bronc rider.

37:17.481 --> 37:18.415
Thanks.

37:18.482 --> 37:19.449
Okay, so, uh,

37:19.517 --> 37:20.483
I held up my end
of the bargain.

37:20.551 --> 37:22.184
What's going on
with my ride?

37:22.252 --> 37:24.554
Yeah, well, uh...

37:25.456 --> 37:26.556
Thing is...

37:30.159 --> 37:31.660
<i>Caleb:
It was an accident.</i>

37:31.728 --> 37:33.529
I'll kill him.
Yeah, well, it's not all his fault.

37:33.596 --> 37:34.897
He was the one
driving it, right?

37:34.964 --> 37:37.299
You know, that's not exactly
important right now.

37:37.366 --> 37:38.600
Waylon:
You smashed up my ride?

37:38.668 --> 37:40.101
Easy, now.

37:40.169 --> 37:41.102
You think that tub
is a joke?

37:41.170 --> 37:42.103
That's my livelihood.

37:42.171 --> 37:43.271
Look, I'm really sorry,
okay?

37:43.339 --> 37:44.605
But I think I fixed it.

37:44.673 --> 37:46.441
So, just wait right here
for a second, okay?

37:47.643 --> 37:48.810
Ty find a new tub?

37:48.877 --> 37:50.044
Not exactly...

37:50.111 --> 37:51.245
Oh boy.

37:51.313 --> 37:52.747
(Vehicle rumbles loudly)

37:57.352 --> 37:58.886
A toilet.

37:58.954 --> 38:02.355
You replaced my tub
with a toilet?

38:03.290 --> 38:04.558
You brilliant
son of a gun!

38:04.625 --> 38:05.692
That is awesome!

38:07.728 --> 38:08.762
Ty:
Yeah!

38:12.299 --> 38:13.399
Caleb:
Impressive.

38:14.802 --> 38:15.868
<i>Waylon:
Yeah!</i>

38:18.605 --> 38:20.005
(Record button clicks)

38:23.009 --> 38:24.042
(Sighs)

38:25.679 --> 38:27.346
Hey, Lou.

38:27.413 --> 38:30.015
I guess this is like
my resignation.

38:30.083 --> 38:33.818
I just wanted to say thank you
for the opportunity

38:33.886 --> 38:37.455
to work for such
an obsessive-compulsive,

38:37.523 --> 38:40.291
micro-managing,
anal-retentive boss

38:40.359 --> 38:42.660
with the most insane
expectations

38:42.728 --> 38:44.228
and standards.

38:44.296 --> 38:47.164
Now I know, no matter
what life throws at me,

38:47.232 --> 38:48.699
I can handle it,

38:48.766 --> 38:51.568
because I survived working
for Lou Fleming-Morris.

38:56.040 --> 38:58.475
(On the verge of tears)
Actually,

38:59.410 --> 39:01.879
I should also say,

39:01.946 --> 39:05.648
no matter how crazy
it's been working for you,

39:05.716 --> 39:07.850
I've always respected you.

39:08.785 --> 39:11.153
Always felt like
you were a friend,

39:11.221 --> 39:13.856
like we were family.

39:13.924 --> 39:16.659
But I guess
I was just kidding myself.

39:17.561 --> 39:20.294
How could you spy on me,
Lou?

39:20.362 --> 39:22.330
That's so not fair.

39:30.318 --> 39:33.753
<i>(Engine buzzes,
Waylon whoops happily)</i>

39:33.821 --> 39:35.389
So I went back
to Maggie's

39:35.456 --> 39:37.790
and luckily the toilet
was still sitting out back.

39:37.857 --> 39:39.358
- Did you clean it?
- No.

39:39.426 --> 39:40.993
Lou:
Grampa!

39:41.061 --> 39:42.828
Dad hurt his knee
really bad.

39:42.896 --> 39:44.197
We need to get him
to a hospital.

39:46.800 --> 39:48.668
Seriously?
A travois?

39:49.570 --> 39:52.270
Could this day
get any crazier?

39:55.174 --> 39:57.609
<i>Waylon:
This is awesome!</i>

39:58.578 --> 40:00.278
Whoa! Sweet!

40:00.346 --> 40:01.413
Waylon:
Woo!

40:03.816 --> 40:04.916
(Laughs excitedly)

40:06.319 --> 40:08.219
Get me off this thing!

40:12.824 --> 40:13.824
Where is she?

40:13.891 --> 40:16.026
Uh, in the nursery.

40:20.565 --> 40:22.766
(Nursery door creaks open)

40:24.301 --> 40:25.401
(Door shuts)

40:28.439 --> 40:29.905
She looks fine.

40:29.973 --> 40:31.708
What're you
talking about?

40:31.775 --> 40:32.775
(Sighs)

40:32.843 --> 40:35.445
Stupid phone connection.

40:37.448 --> 40:39.515
Hey, she's gonna
wanna see him

40:39.583 --> 40:41.683
when she wakes up.

40:43.486 --> 40:46.988
I know he looks creepy,
but she loves this guy.

40:47.056 --> 40:49.190
Yeah, well, you didn't buy it
for its looks now, did you?

40:49.259 --> 40:51.326
No. It was a gift.

40:51.394 --> 40:54.028
It's one of those
stupid nanny-cams.

40:54.096 --> 40:56.330
God,
people are so paranoid.

40:56.398 --> 40:57.665
I would never use
one of these,

40:57.733 --> 40:59.032
but Katie just loves him.

41:01.270 --> 41:03.070
A nanny-cam, huh?

41:03.138 --> 41:04.472
Gee,
I wonder how it works?

41:04.539 --> 41:08.309
There's a record button
on the back here.

41:08.377 --> 41:10.278
You know, this would be
really easy to press.

41:10.345 --> 41:12.612
(Gasps) Katie is always
cuddling with this.

41:12.680 --> 41:15.782
I wonder if she ever
accidentally recorded herself.

41:15.849 --> 41:16.783
We should see
if there's anything

41:16.850 --> 41:18.084
on this video recorder.

41:18.152 --> 41:20.553
No! I mean...
Let me.

41:20.621 --> 41:22.188
I can just download it
on your laptop.

41:22.256 --> 41:23.823
Why don't we just watch it
now?

41:23.891 --> 41:26.192
You've had a long trip.

41:26.260 --> 41:29.161
Seriously, I can just edit
all the good bits together,

41:29.228 --> 41:31.697
if there's even anything
on here.

41:31.765 --> 41:34.633
You're right.
I should just chill,

41:34.701 --> 41:37.303
have a shower
while Katie's still napping.

41:37.370 --> 41:38.404
(Sighs)

41:38.471 --> 41:39.838
Oh.

41:39.906 --> 41:43.309
And, uh, thank you,
you know, for everything.

41:43.376 --> 41:45.976
I don't know what I would do
without you.

41:53.985 --> 41:56.788
Amy: And then this
like giant man-bear

41:56.855 --> 41:58.222
comes outta the darkness.

41:58.290 --> 42:00.924
A man-bear.
What is a man-bear?

42:00.991 --> 42:03.126
Okay, he was more like...

42:03.194 --> 42:04.494
A really hairy fat guy.

42:04.562 --> 42:05.629
Ty:
(Laughs)

42:07.998 --> 42:09.599
You Fleming's are crazy.

42:09.667 --> 42:11.368
I firmly believe that.

42:11.436 --> 42:12.869
I should probably get going.
(Laughs)

42:14.238 --> 42:16.206
Ty: I'll see you later.
Amy: Yeah.

42:21.378 --> 42:24.380
Hey, Dad.
What'd the doc say?

42:24.448 --> 42:26.281
Agh...

42:26.350 --> 42:27.850
Strained a few ligaments.

42:27.917 --> 42:29.552
No tears this time.

42:29.619 --> 42:31.454
So I'm guessing
this is another surprise?

42:31.521 --> 42:33.187
Yeah, well...

42:34.357 --> 42:35.923
Let's hope Shane
likes this one.

42:35.991 --> 42:37.124
(Steer moos)

42:38.327 --> 42:39.728
(Tim chuckles
and grunts in pain)

42:43.432 --> 42:44.499
Honey,

42:46.435 --> 42:48.069
I'm real sorry about
missing all those years

42:48.136 --> 42:50.070
when you were a kid.

42:50.137 --> 42:52.773
Dad, that's water
way under the bridge.

42:52.841 --> 42:55.843
We're in a good spot now,
right?

42:55.910 --> 42:59.346
Well, you have to remind me
how we got here again?

42:59.413 --> 43:02.782
How did I manage to make up
for all those years?

43:02.850 --> 43:04.918
You never gave up.

43:04.986 --> 43:06.019
I love you.

43:06.087 --> 43:07.453
Love you, too.

43:08.489 --> 43:11.024
<i>Shane:
Whoa! You got a steer!</i>

43:11.092 --> 43:12.491
Hey.

43:12.558 --> 43:14.159
Thought you might wanna
practice your roping

43:14.227 --> 43:15.794
on that guy.

43:16.796 --> 43:17.863
Wait. Really?

43:17.931 --> 43:18.998
(Chuckles)

43:20.133 --> 43:21.267
What about the goat?

43:21.334 --> 43:22.902
Ah, you can keep him
as a pet.

43:22.969 --> 43:24.736
You're old enough
for the real deal.

43:27.307 --> 43:28.973
So I'll bet your knee's
really sore.

43:29.041 --> 43:30.574
Nah.

43:30.642 --> 43:33.912
Not as bad as the first time
I wrecked it back in '83.

43:33.979 --> 43:35.313
It was '84.

43:35.381 --> 43:36.680
What?

43:36.748 --> 43:39.951
You hurt it bulldogging
at Grande Prairie in '84.

43:40.019 --> 43:42.220
I read about it online.

43:42.288 --> 43:43.721
And your back injury

43:43.789 --> 43:45.422
was from a nasty bronc
named Night Train

43:45.489 --> 43:46.957
at the Stampede in '88.

43:47.025 --> 43:48.325
(Chuckles)

43:48.393 --> 43:50.160
I'm impressed.

43:50.228 --> 43:53.263
But I never read anything
about a shoulder injury.

43:53.331 --> 43:57.334
Yeah, well, that's 'cause
it didn't happen at a rodeo.

43:57.402 --> 43:59.202
Gunshot.

43:59.270 --> 44:00.303
Wait. Really?

44:00.370 --> 44:02.405
Yeah.
Yeah, real standoff.

44:02.472 --> 44:04.206
Some of the meanest,
orneriest cattle rustlers

44:04.274 --> 44:06.508
you ever met
in the West.

44:06.576 --> 44:09.011
I don't talk about it
much...

44:09.079 --> 44:11.314
There were a lot of rifles.
Amy was surrounded by them;

44:11.381 --> 44:13.416
They were all aimed at her.

44:13.483 --> 44:16.451
I had to.
And then I dove.

44:16.518 --> 44:18.253
Dove in front of a bullet.

44:18.321 --> 44:22.324
I had to run 100 to 150 yards -
a sprint.

44:22.391 --> 44:24.426
Yeah, I won't forget it...
