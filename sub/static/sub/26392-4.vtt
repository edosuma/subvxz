WEBVTT

00:02.089 --> 00:03.742
Hey, Jake,
I'm back from the framers.

00:03.786 --> 00:07.224
I can't wait to get
this thing hung up on the wall.

00:07.268 --> 00:11.098
Well, you won't have
to wait long, little lady.

00:11.141 --> 00:16.016
There's a new sheriff in town,
and that frame is about to hang.

00:17.017 --> 00:20.063
Mm. Ah, ah, ah.[whirring]

00:20.107 --> 00:21.543
[exhales sharply]

00:21.586 --> 00:23.197
[Southern accent]: Are you sure
that you're the sheriff?

00:23.240 --> 00:25.808
Can I see your badge?

00:25.851 --> 00:27.592
Well, you're gonna have
to wait about five minutes.

00:27.636 --> 00:29.420
I was just upstairs
polishing it.

00:29.464 --> 00:32.771
Okay, guys, hi. Hi, guys. Um...

00:32.815 --> 00:34.773
Before you get too deep
into your cowboy role-play,

00:34.817 --> 00:37.037
I just wanted to let you know
I'm in the room.JAKE: Oh, no, it's...

00:37.080 --> 00:38.864
You can stay, Cooper.

00:38.908 --> 00:42.172
Well, I guess I do
live here rent-free.

00:42.216 --> 00:44.435
Give me one second, I'll go
upstairs, get my cowboy hat.

00:44.479 --> 00:46.785
No, no, no, no. No.What? What? No. No. No.

00:46.829 --> 00:49.701
Ha-ha. He means we're actually
hanging a photo. See?What? Oh.

00:49.745 --> 00:50.789
It's from our wedding.

00:50.833 --> 00:51.790
Aw.
Yeah.

00:51.834 --> 00:53.357
You were so emotional.

00:53.401 --> 00:54.837
And, Claire, you look gorgeous.

00:56.665 --> 00:58.667
Step aside, Jake.

00:58.710 --> 01:00.756
Your mother-in-law is here
to teach you how to screw.

01:02.105 --> 01:04.455
Say something, Gerald.
I made it weird.

01:04.499 --> 01:05.717
GERALD:
Uh...

01:05.761 --> 01:09.156
Make way. Daddy's big drill
is coming through.

01:10.809 --> 01:13.247
I made it worse.

01:15.597 --> 01:16.772
Uh, Claire,
what are your parents

01:16.815 --> 01:18.426
doing in our house again?

01:18.469 --> 01:21.168
Oh. I-I just mentioned to them
that we were hanging a picture,

01:21.211 --> 01:22.560
and they came over to help.

01:22.604 --> 01:24.780
But I spent my whole morning
learning how to do this.

01:24.823 --> 01:27.522
I started off googling
"well hung pictures," and...

01:29.132 --> 01:31.917
...let's just say my confidence
could use a boost.

01:31.961 --> 01:33.702
It's all good,
Jake. We got it.

01:33.745 --> 01:35.878
Already got my
stud finder out.

01:35.921 --> 01:37.619
Beep. Beep, beep,
beep. Uh-oh.

01:37.662 --> 01:39.055
It looks like he found one.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.622
Beep, beep, beep,
beep, beep, beep.

01:40.665 --> 01:42.493
Beep, beep, beep-- wow!

01:42.537 --> 01:44.278
[laughs]

01:44.321 --> 01:45.453
Ha, ha.

01:45.496 --> 01:47.281
Picture hung.
[whoops]

01:47.324 --> 01:49.152
Construction work is hard.
Feels like we earned ourselves

01:49.196 --> 01:50.284
a couple cold ones.

01:50.327 --> 01:52.764
Already got 'em chilling
in my purse, baby.

01:52.808 --> 01:54.984
[laughs]:
Yeah.[laughs]

01:55.027 --> 01:56.855
Bye.Bye. Thank you.

01:56.899 --> 01:58.944
Bye.
Mm.
Bye.

01:58.988 --> 02:00.511
Man, I love
living with you guys.

02:00.555 --> 02:02.600
It's so nice to be
with a family of young adults

02:02.644 --> 02:04.472
who aren't too proud
to let the older generation

02:04.515 --> 02:07.039
do everything for 'em.

02:09.738 --> 02:11.392
Claire, did you hear that?

02:11.435 --> 02:13.698
Yeah. He called us young.

02:13.742 --> 02:18.050
No, I'm talking about your
parents doing everything for us.

02:18.094 --> 02:20.183
Cooper's right. I mean,
look at our wedding photo.

02:20.227 --> 02:23.708
They chose the venue,
the flowers, your mom deejayed.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.190
The only thing
I got to choose was you.

02:27.234 --> 02:29.714
Aw.
Mm-mm, Claire,

02:29.758 --> 02:32.891
don't get lost in my buttery
sweetness. I'm upset.

02:32.935 --> 02:34.893
Come on, you know
how my parents are.

02:34.937 --> 02:37.853
They love to do stuff for me
'cause I'm their pride and joy.

02:37.896 --> 02:40.899
Also, they're afraid that
I'm gonna put them in a home.

02:44.338 --> 02:45.774
Well, now that they're
retired, it's like

02:45.817 --> 02:47.558
they took all their energy
from being doctors

02:47.602 --> 02:49.517
and focused it entirely on us.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.301
Well, us and drinking.

02:52.955 --> 02:55.566
Well, us and drinking
and denying climate change.

02:57.742 --> 03:01.137
♪ Imagine me and you, I do

03:01.181 --> 03:04.053
♪ I think about you
day and night ♪

03:04.096 --> 03:05.663
♪ It's only right

03:05.707 --> 03:08.449
♪ So happy together.

03:08.492 --> 03:10.755
[vocalizing]

03:20.287 --> 03:21.244
[coughing]

03:21.288 --> 03:22.245
[sniffles]

03:22.289 --> 03:24.639
Hey.

03:24.682 --> 03:27.381
As soon as I got your text
about being sick,

03:27.424 --> 03:30.558
I went straight to CVS to pick
up a little Claire-package.

03:30.601 --> 03:34.823
Uh, we've got DayQuil,
uh, VapoRub,

03:34.866 --> 03:36.607
and both Imodium and Ex-Lax,

03:36.651 --> 03:39.480
depending on the direction
of traffic.

03:39.523 --> 03:42.004
Thanks. Uh, but what about work?

03:42.047 --> 03:43.832
Ah, they're having a diversity
seminar, and I want them all

03:43.875 --> 03:45.877
to sweat when they see
I'm not there.

03:48.315 --> 03:49.794
I'm just so happy
you called me first,

03:49.838 --> 03:52.841
and not your parents...That'll be all, Nurse Davis.

03:52.884 --> 03:54.625
Mom and Dad are scrubbing in.

03:54.669 --> 03:57.846
What are they doing here?

03:57.889 --> 03:59.717
I swear, I didn't call them.

03:59.761 --> 04:03.286
They came by to fix the garden
hose so they could wash my car,

04:03.330 --> 04:04.679
and then, I don't know,

04:04.722 --> 04:08.509
they just, they just
heard me sneezing.

04:08.552 --> 04:10.859
This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

04:10.902 --> 04:12.513
No, this is different,
because I am sick,

04:12.556 --> 04:14.341
and they're doctors.

04:14.384 --> 04:19.302
And plus, I don't like you
seeing me when I'm all gross.

04:19.346 --> 04:22.566
Claire-bear, two months
into dating, you got so wasted

04:22.610 --> 04:25.961
at a frat party,
you threw up a whole hot dog.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.573
Sure, I had questions,

04:29.617 --> 04:32.533
but I still thought you were
the hottest girl in the world.

04:32.576 --> 04:37.277
Man, if I had kept it down,
I would've won that contest.

04:39.714 --> 04:43.805
My point is, eventually,
we're gonna have kids, right?

04:43.848 --> 04:46.938
And when we do, I want
to be the one you rely on.

04:46.982 --> 04:48.766
Please let me prove
I can take care of you.

04:48.810 --> 04:51.247
Aw. Well, that's really sweet.
[chuckles]

04:51.291 --> 04:55.556
Okay. Uh, hey, uh, Mom, Dad?
You guys can go.

04:55.599 --> 04:56.948
Uh, Jake's gonna
take care of me.

04:56.992 --> 04:59.255
[both laughing]

05:08.873 --> 05:12.312
Oh, my gosh. She's serious.

05:12.355 --> 05:14.662
Jake, I-I don't want
to question your manhood

05:14.705 --> 05:16.707
in front of your wife, so...Thank you.

05:16.751 --> 05:18.666
...can we do this
in the kitchen instead?

05:20.189 --> 05:22.147
[sighs]

05:22.191 --> 05:23.714
All right, look,
I know you guys are nervous,

05:23.758 --> 05:26.151
but I've taken care of Claire
when she's sick. All right?

05:26.195 --> 05:28.458
Okay. Just so you know,
when Claire is sick,

05:28.502 --> 05:30.112
she needs a ton of blankets...

05:30.155 --> 05:32.375
Blankets. Yeah, yeah.
I got her covered.On-- okay. Oh.

05:32.419 --> 05:35.030
Oh, okay. Well, she also needs
a steady rotation of herYeah.

05:35.073 --> 05:36.771
favorite movies. Mm-hmm.Favorite movies. Yes, I got it.

05:36.814 --> 05:39.382
Now, do you guys have
any actual medical advice?

05:39.426 --> 05:42.385
Hold it. What about my famous
Kung Pao lettuce wraps?

05:42.429 --> 05:44.387
You don't know about
those, do you? Yeah.

05:44.431 --> 05:45.867
Little Eastern medicine secret
I picked up

05:45.910 --> 05:47.216
while I was living in Beijing.

05:47.259 --> 05:49.044
Yeah, as a wise
village elder

05:49.087 --> 05:51.351
once said to me...
[clears throat]

05:51.394 --> 05:55.398
Ni hao.

05:59.576 --> 06:02.492
Well, as a wise village elder
once said to me...

06:02.536 --> 06:04.364
[clears throat]

06:04.407 --> 06:06.061
...get the hell out of my house.

06:13.938 --> 06:17.551
All right,
my little petri dish.

06:17.594 --> 06:20.249
I got a hot towel to help
open up your sinuses.

06:20.292 --> 06:24.601
Here you go, my little
baby boo-- ew!

06:24.645 --> 06:26.081
Oh, man.

06:26.124 --> 06:27.604
Ugh.

06:27.648 --> 06:30.172
Why are you just
staring at the ceiling?

06:30.215 --> 06:33.262
'Cause you look like E.T.
when he started getting ashy.

06:37.527 --> 06:40.617
But I love you, and I'm gonna
help you get through this.

06:40.661 --> 06:44.229
So here's a towel for your face.
Wear it as long as you'd like.

06:47.711 --> 06:49.234
Ooh. Thanks, baby.

06:49.278 --> 06:50.540
You're welcome.

06:50.584 --> 06:52.934
[sneezes]
Aw...

06:52.977 --> 06:54.979
That was kind of cute.

06:55.023 --> 06:56.285
A little dab for you.
[chuckles]

06:56.328 --> 06:57.982
[sneezes][shouts]

06:58.026 --> 07:00.855
Come on!

07:00.898 --> 07:02.422
Ugh.

07:03.727 --> 07:04.946
Oh, my God, Jake.

07:04.989 --> 07:07.427
These lettuce wraps
are incredible.

07:07.470 --> 07:09.603
I might write a
song about them.
Really?

07:09.646 --> 07:12.693
Nah. I mostly write songs
about butts.

07:14.172 --> 07:15.347
Claire, can I make you a plate?

07:15.391 --> 07:16.610
Oh, not right now.

07:16.653 --> 07:18.394
This cough medicine's
giving me a nice buzz,

07:18.438 --> 07:20.657
and I don't want
to mess that up.

07:20.701 --> 07:22.354
Well, how about another movie?

07:22.398 --> 07:24.313
Hey, uh, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

07:24.356 --> 07:25.488
What are you guys doing here?

07:25.532 --> 07:27.142
I said I have everything
under control.

07:27.185 --> 07:30.319
You have snot in your eyebrow.

07:32.843 --> 07:35.585
We respected your wishes
as long as we could,

07:35.629 --> 07:37.935
but now we are here to
relieve you of your duties.

07:37.979 --> 07:39.459
That's right.
We appreciate all your efforts

07:39.502 --> 07:40.895
and so on and so forth,

07:40.938 --> 07:43.506
blah, blah, blah.Okay. Dad, stop.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.116
No, Jake is doing a great job.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.510
I see all the blankets
and the movies.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.251
What about
the lettuce wraps?

07:49.294 --> 07:50.513
They're amazing. Try them.

07:54.038 --> 07:54.996
JAKE:
Mm-hmm.

07:55.039 --> 07:56.650
Yeah.Mmm. Wow.

07:56.693 --> 07:58.826
Kid's got moves.

07:58.869 --> 08:00.828
These are actually good.Mm-hmm.

08:00.871 --> 08:04.701
As a wise Jake once said,
you're damn right they're good.

08:06.790 --> 08:10.620
Honey, I-I can't believe
I'm saying this,

08:10.664 --> 08:12.840
but I think Jake has everything
under control.

08:12.883 --> 08:16.496
I know. Gerald, I don't, I don't
think they need us anymore.

08:16.539 --> 08:17.801
JAKE:
Eh, well, guys,

08:17.845 --> 08:19.368
I know it's hard
to let go of your baby, but...

08:19.411 --> 08:21.936
We're free![both laugh]

08:23.067 --> 08:24.025
Wait, what?

08:24.068 --> 08:25.548
Ugh, we have been
living our lives

08:25.592 --> 08:28.420
at half buzz
just in case, but Gerald...

08:30.422 --> 08:32.555
...now that we're off the hook,
we can finally go crazy,

08:32.599 --> 08:34.731
like, North Florida crazy.

08:34.775 --> 08:36.733
[laughs]

08:37.778 --> 08:40.302
Come on, baby, let's go.

08:40.345 --> 08:43.348
Hey, dude. Take this.

08:47.222 --> 08:48.702
Now that we've got them
out of our hair,

08:48.745 --> 08:54.011
it's just me and my beautiful--
why do you look like that?

08:54.055 --> 08:55.752
Goodness.

08:58.799 --> 09:02.367
Hey, guys.
Man, I don't feel good.

09:02.411 --> 09:04.587
Oh, no, I hope you didn't
catch what I have.

09:04.631 --> 09:06.067
No. I think it's food poisoning.

09:06.110 --> 09:08.112
Oh. That's what
those noises were?

09:08.156 --> 09:11.246
I thought you were slowly
deflating a balloon.

09:15.729 --> 09:18.209
Man, I'm sorry, Cooper.

09:18.253 --> 09:20.472
Wait, aren't you performing
at the VMAs tonight?

09:20.516 --> 09:22.910
Yeah. Yeah, I'll just, uh,
I'll just have to power through.

09:22.953 --> 09:24.868
Uh, are you sure
that's a good idea?

09:24.912 --> 09:27.610
Ah, it's just, it's just
an upset stomach. I'll be fine.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.525
I mean, all I'm doing
is flying over the audience

09:29.569 --> 09:31.483
in a white angel costume,
while performing a cover

09:31.527 --> 09:34.095
of "Drop It Like It's Hot."

09:34.138 --> 09:35.966
Okay, uh...

09:36.010 --> 09:39.883
I think, uh,
you got to stay home, buddy.

09:39.927 --> 09:40.884
Is that even an option?
I don't think

09:40.928 --> 09:42.407
I've ever taken a day off work.

09:42.451 --> 09:44.409
Oh, yeah, I guess
for rock stars,

09:44.453 --> 09:46.237
a sick day usually
just means rehab.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.245
Ugh, so what did
you eat today, anyway?

09:54.289 --> 09:56.247
The only thing I've had
are Jake's lettuce wraps.

09:56.291 --> 09:57.597
JAKE:
Okay.

09:57.640 --> 09:58.859
Before we start throwing
accusations around

09:58.902 --> 10:01.731
that we can't take back,
let me just say,

10:01.775 --> 10:04.429
it wasn't the wraps
and you're a filthy liar.

10:04.473 --> 10:06.562
Yeah-- Jake.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.085
[high-pitched]: It wasn't
my wraps. It's not my wraps.

10:10.174 --> 10:12.612
Your parents had them,
and they're fine.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.701
You...

10:16.485 --> 10:20.576
You did this to us
with your lettuce wraps.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.579
They poisoned us in the middle
of our tennis match while...

10:23.623 --> 10:26.974
[moans]
Oh, I'm so sorry, Gerald. No.

10:27.017 --> 10:28.497
No. No.
No.

10:28.540 --> 10:29.846
I'm sorry,
it's happening.

10:31.674 --> 10:33.633
[sniffling, panting]

10:35.678 --> 10:41.292
We tried to make it back
to our house, but we couldn't.

10:41.336 --> 10:44.252
Jake, I need you
to move my car.

10:44.295 --> 10:46.297
It's the one
with the doors open,

10:46.341 --> 10:49.257
still running,
parked in your bushes.

10:58.396 --> 10:59.833
That one's out of order.

10:59.876 --> 11:01.878
[moans]

11:10.365 --> 11:11.540
So, we were just about to beat

11:11.583 --> 11:13.498
our old tennis rivals,
The Richardsons...

11:13.542 --> 11:16.110
Oh, we had those cocky S.O.B.s
right where we wanted them.

11:16.153 --> 11:19.069
Set point.

11:19.113 --> 11:20.723
Okay, Mom, you're not
on the court anymore.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.072
Come sit down.Oh, no.

11:22.116 --> 11:23.857
I am in a match
with my stomach right now.

11:25.293 --> 11:29.253
Oh, backhand down the line.

11:29.297 --> 11:31.560
No, it hit the net.

11:33.127 --> 11:34.868
Your mom went to serve,
then we got hit

11:34.911 --> 11:36.913
by the same wave
of food poisoning,

11:36.957 --> 11:39.742
all because we let this guy
take care of you.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.265
Okay, hold on, Dad.

11:41.309 --> 11:43.006
We can't blame all this on Jake.

11:43.050 --> 11:45.269
Oh, it had to be
those damn wraps.

11:45.313 --> 11:47.358
The only other food we had today

11:47.402 --> 11:51.145
were olives, two celery sticks
and an orange peel.

11:53.147 --> 11:55.105
So just cocktail
garnishes.

11:56.498 --> 11:58.674
You guys probably have
alcohol poisoning.

12:02.286 --> 12:03.766
I mean, how can germs
even survive

12:03.810 --> 12:06.464
in that duty-free store
you call a stomach?

12:06.508 --> 12:09.729
Then why is Cooper also sick?

12:09.772 --> 12:11.774
Sorry to miss the VMAs, guys,

12:11.818 --> 12:13.994
but, uh, I promise
I'll make it up to you all

12:14.037 --> 12:15.212
when I'm feeling better.

12:15.256 --> 12:17.432
Especially you, Lauren.

12:17.475 --> 12:18.781
Oh, who's Lauren?

12:18.825 --> 12:21.001
Don't know, but, uh,
12,000 girls named Lauren

12:21.044 --> 12:22.742
just swallowed their retainers.

12:24.787 --> 12:26.310
Great job, Jake.

12:26.354 --> 12:27.964
We leave you in charge
for one day

12:28.008 --> 12:29.792
and you poison
the whole family. You...

12:29.836 --> 12:32.534
You're like a villain
from Game of Thrones.

12:37.278 --> 12:40.368
Look, I am telling you,
this is all one big coincidence.

12:40.411 --> 12:42.196
Okay, so, you're telling me
you washed your hands

12:42.239 --> 12:43.327
before you started cooking?

12:43.371 --> 12:44.851
Yes, Gerald.

12:44.894 --> 12:46.983
And you cooked the chicken
all the way?

12:47.027 --> 12:49.551
Yes, Bonnie.

12:49.594 --> 12:51.422
And did you wash the lettuce?

12:51.466 --> 12:52.554
Y...

12:54.730 --> 12:58.821
Did I wash the lettuce?

12:58.865 --> 13:01.824
Did Iwash
the lettuce?

13:01.868 --> 13:05.088
Did I washthe lettuce?

13:06.655 --> 13:08.526
Of course, Gerald. Of course.

13:08.570 --> 13:10.311
What, do you think I thought the
grocery store washed it already

13:10.354 --> 13:11.355
with the little mist thing?

13:11.399 --> 13:12.792
Is that what you think
I thought?

13:25.282 --> 13:27.371
Is that what you thought?

13:27.415 --> 13:30.853
No, that is not what I thought.

13:30.897 --> 13:33.551
Only an idiot would think
misting is washing.

13:33.595 --> 13:36.337
Misting is not washing,
which I know

13:36.380 --> 13:39.035
because I am
not an idiot.

13:39.079 --> 13:40.907
Okay, fine.

13:40.950 --> 13:42.038
Eat one.

13:49.916 --> 13:52.701
A good chef never
eats his own food.

13:52.744 --> 13:54.703
Eat the wrap, Jake.

13:54.746 --> 13:56.574
If you washed the lettuce, you
have nothing to be afraid of.

13:56.618 --> 13:59.099
Do I look afraid,
Uncle Phil?

14:03.930 --> 14:05.409
I'm not. Watch.

14:05.453 --> 14:08.282
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

14:12.503 --> 14:16.812
Do you not think we know
how eating works?

14:17.857 --> 14:19.597
Gerald, I guess
we might as well

14:19.641 --> 14:21.425
move our burial plots
to the backyard

14:21.469 --> 14:22.905
because we are
gonna be taking care

14:22.949 --> 14:25.386
of these dummies
for eternity.

14:27.431 --> 14:29.259
[sighs]
You know what? Fine, fine.

14:29.303 --> 14:31.261
Here, look. I'll
eat one. All right?

14:31.305 --> 14:32.610
You want me to eat one,
I'll eat one.

14:32.654 --> 14:33.916
No, Jake, you don't
have to do this.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.048
It's okay if you messed up.

14:35.091 --> 14:37.964
[laughing]:
Claire, I didn't mess up.

14:38.007 --> 14:40.314
[high-pitched]: It's not,
it's not the wraps. It's not.

14:41.619 --> 14:42.620
It's not the wraps, okay?

14:42.664 --> 14:44.100
I can take care
of our family

14:44.144 --> 14:47.538
by myself and I'll prove it.

14:50.498 --> 14:52.500
Mmm.

14:55.329 --> 14:58.245
You got about 20 minutes
to get your affairs in order.

15:02.118 --> 15:05.730
Hey. How's my little
Febreze commercial?

15:05.774 --> 15:07.732
[groaning]

15:07.776 --> 15:11.649
So, my lettuce wraps have had
three hours of tummy time,

15:11.693 --> 15:12.824
and guess what?

15:12.868 --> 15:16.611
[singsongy]:
I feel incredible.

15:16.654 --> 15:19.135
[all groaning]I'm sorry, I, uh,

15:19.179 --> 15:20.441
don't speak groan,

15:20.484 --> 15:22.095
but what I assume
you said was,

15:22.138 --> 15:24.749
"Thank you so much for taking
good care of our daughter."

15:24.793 --> 15:26.751
"Sorry we ever doubted you."

15:26.795 --> 15:31.234
"P.S. That's a
great haircut."

15:31.278 --> 15:32.627
Thank you, Gerald.

15:32.670 --> 15:34.672
Yours, too.

15:37.023 --> 15:39.155
We are sorry, Jake.

15:39.199 --> 15:41.853
You didn't poison us and
you're doing an amazing job.

15:41.897 --> 15:43.594
And...?

15:43.638 --> 15:45.901
It is a nice haircut.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.556
All right. Well, thank you two.

15:48.599 --> 15:49.905
Who wants OJ?

15:51.254 --> 15:52.516
There you go.

15:52.560 --> 15:56.477
[affected]:
We've got some water for Cooper.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.783
[groans]Bonnie, would you...?

15:58.827 --> 16:00.742
Oh, no, no, no.
I-I made my own.

16:00.785 --> 16:04.702
It's a special elixir
from Dr. Smirnoff.

16:04.746 --> 16:09.011
Well, I'm gonna go to the
kitchen where I will continue

16:09.055 --> 16:12.928
to be the most badass
caretaker on the planet.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.147
I love you, babe.

16:14.190 --> 16:15.322
I love you, too, boo.

16:21.458 --> 16:22.894
[panting]:
I'm gonna d...

16:22.938 --> 16:24.940
I'm gonna d...
I'm gonna die.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.159
I'm gonna die.

16:26.202 --> 16:31.033
I'm g... I'm gonna die.

16:31.077 --> 16:32.861
[laughs, coughs]

16:32.904 --> 16:34.341
GERALD: Jake?CLAIRE: Jake?

16:34.384 --> 16:36.560
Jake...Jake, we're really
cold in here.

16:36.604 --> 16:38.649
Come back, Jake.JAKE: Coming!

16:42.436 --> 16:44.568
You can do this, Jake.
Jake, you can do th...

16:44.612 --> 16:47.093
[gags, coughs]

16:47.136 --> 16:49.182
Jake, you can do... [gags]

16:49.225 --> 16:51.445
You can do this, man.

16:54.448 --> 16:56.624
Okay.

16:56.667 --> 17:00.106
Dug up a space heater
from the garage.

17:00.149 --> 17:02.064
And since Claire's
using all the blankets,

17:02.108 --> 17:04.675
I brought in floor mats
from the car to keep you warm.

17:04.719 --> 17:06.460
I'll take the passenger side.

17:06.503 --> 17:10.029
Thanks for everything, Jake.

17:10.072 --> 17:11.943
And remember,
I will be your rock

17:11.987 --> 17:15.556
until you all feel
as good as I do. [groans]

17:15.599 --> 17:18.559
[doorbell rings]

17:18.602 --> 17:20.778
Plugged in the
space heater.

17:20.822 --> 17:21.823
[sighs]

17:22.824 --> 17:25.348
Wayne, hey.
Hello, hi.

17:25.392 --> 17:26.828
Cooper, your manager's here.WAYNE: I came to see

17:26.871 --> 17:29.265
how you all are feeling,
and by "you all," I mean Cooper.

17:29.309 --> 17:30.832
What are all
those things, Wayne?

17:30.875 --> 17:33.008
Well, ever since you
posted that video,

17:33.052 --> 17:35.358
our office has been overrun
with "get well" presents

17:35.402 --> 17:36.707
from your fans.

17:36.751 --> 17:38.492
They even sent a
cantaloupe Cooper.

17:39.884 --> 17:41.060
There was a torso, too,

17:41.103 --> 17:43.801
but I got a little hungry
on the way over.

17:43.845 --> 17:45.847
Wayne, could you close the door?
We're all really cold.

17:45.890 --> 17:49.068
Yeah. Turn up the ole
space heater for you guys.

17:49.111 --> 17:51.461
There.

17:51.505 --> 17:54.116
Hey, uh, Wayne, can I talk
to you in the kitchen?

17:54.160 --> 17:55.552
Oh, sure. Nothing more fun

17:55.596 --> 17:57.685
than a little bro time,
or so I've heard.

18:00.688 --> 18:03.386
Oh.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.562
Wayne, can I
ask you something?

18:05.606 --> 18:08.478
If this is about us having
a boys' night, I am in.

18:08.522 --> 18:11.394
No, I'm the one who gave
everyone food poisoning,

18:11.438 --> 18:13.004
including myself.

18:13.048 --> 18:14.136
I need you to help me make sure

18:14.180 --> 18:15.268
that no one finds out
that I am sick

18:15.311 --> 18:16.617
because I am killing it.

18:16.660 --> 18:19.098
Congratulations.
Your couch is on fire.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.142
Hell yeah, it is.

18:20.186 --> 18:21.404
I know I use
a lot of slang,

18:21.448 --> 18:23.232
but your couch is
literally on fire.

18:23.276 --> 18:24.668
Oh, my God!

18:26.017 --> 18:27.454
I put the space heater
too close.

18:27.497 --> 18:29.499
You accidentally put the
space heater too close, Jake.

18:29.543 --> 18:31.197
That's what the jury
needs to hear. [coughs]

18:31.240 --> 18:33.677
[coughs]Ooh, this'll put it out.

18:33.721 --> 18:34.722
No, that's not water.

18:38.682 --> 18:40.293
[screaming]

18:42.686 --> 18:44.253
Look at that coward
running away.

18:44.297 --> 18:48.649
Aah!

18:49.911 --> 18:51.695
COOPER:
Nice one, Jake.

18:51.739 --> 18:54.307
Good thing I fixed
that hose earlier.

18:54.350 --> 18:57.440
Has anybody tried these
lettuce wraps? They're amazing.

18:58.615 --> 19:00.095
Well, better go.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.141
Got my first date
since the big divorce.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.577
Real special lady, too.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.492
I'm taking her up
in a hot air balloon.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.670
Yeah, for the next four hours,
it'll just be me, her

19:09.713 --> 19:12.629
and the sweet silence
of life in the clouds.

19:12.673 --> 19:14.675
Mmm.

19:24.424 --> 19:25.947
Oh, God.

19:25.990 --> 19:29.385
Oh, babe, you are sick.

19:29.429 --> 19:31.605
Why don't you come
lay down on the couch?

19:31.648 --> 19:33.781
All the embers are out.

19:33.824 --> 19:37.437
No, no, no, I-I-I said
I was gonna take care of you

19:37.480 --> 19:39.874
and that is exactly what
I'm gonna d... [gags]

19:39.917 --> 19:42.616
Claire, hold my hair back.
Claire. [gags]

19:42.659 --> 19:44.531
Babe, come on.

19:44.574 --> 19:46.010
So you made one little mistake.

19:46.054 --> 19:47.229
It's okay to admit it.

19:47.273 --> 19:49.057
No, it isn't.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.842
If I can't even take care
of my wife when she's sick,

19:51.886 --> 19:54.541
how am I ever gonna be able
to take care of a kid?

19:54.584 --> 19:56.456
[laughing]:
Don't worry.

19:56.499 --> 19:58.632
After what you did today,

19:58.675 --> 20:01.112
no one's gonna trust you
with their kid.

20:02.331 --> 20:04.464
[laughs]
No, seriously.

20:04.507 --> 20:06.161
Honey, you put
your own needs aside

20:06.205 --> 20:08.119
to take care
of everyone else.

20:08.163 --> 20:09.991
And if that's not proof
you're gonna be a great parent,

20:10.034 --> 20:11.601
I don't know what is.

20:11.645 --> 20:15.083
I guess that's true.
It is.

20:15.126 --> 20:18.434
And even if you did
poison everyone else,

20:18.478 --> 20:20.654
I'm actually starting
to feel better,

20:20.697 --> 20:23.961
so technically,
you did take care of me.

20:24.005 --> 20:26.312
Yeah, you're right.[chuckles]

20:26.355 --> 20:27.530
I'm the best husband ever.

20:27.574 --> 20:29.924
All right, so now that
you've proven that,

20:29.967 --> 20:32.274
can we still rely
on my parents to do some stuff?

20:32.318 --> 20:35.843
Oh, it'll probably be kind of
helpful when we have kids, huh?

20:35.886 --> 20:37.627
Yeah, yeah. We can get them
to do all the stuff

20:37.671 --> 20:39.238
that we don't want to do.

20:39.281 --> 20:42.284
You know, like-like assembling
strollers and changing diapers.

20:42.328 --> 20:43.329
Paying for college.

20:43.372 --> 20:45.200
They would be
so good at that.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.942
So good.
[laughs]

20:47.985 --> 20:50.031
Okay. Thank you again
for taking care of me.

20:50.074 --> 20:52.163
I love you.
I love you, too.

20:52.207 --> 20:53.774
Oh.
Mmm.
