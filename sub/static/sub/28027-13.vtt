John: Welcome,

00:20.246 --> 00:25.251
welcome, welcome to
"last week tonight!"

00:25.253 --> 00:29.857
I'm John Oliver.

00:29.859 --> 00:34.864
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:34.866 --> 00:39.871
Just time for a quick recap
of the week in which a lot

00:39.873 --> 00:42.174
happened, from narendra modi
beginning his second term as

00:42.175 --> 00:44.810
India's prime ministero the
national spelling bee ending in

00:44.811 --> 00:48.514
an 8-way tie -- which is equally
important -- to Robert Mueller

00:48.515 --> 00:51.083
holding a press conference to
scream the word "impeachment"

00:51.084 --> 00:52.017
with his eyes.

00:52.018 --> 00:55.454
And en -and then there
was Jared kushner,

00:55.455 --> 00:58.123
a man who constantly looks like
he was just reset to factory

00:58.124 --> 00:58.824
settings.

00:58.825 --> 01:01.794
Jared has been hard at work
on his middle east peace plan,

01:01.795 --> 01:04.396
an undertaking that requires
precision diplomacy and not

01:04.397 --> 01:06.732
doing anything
needlessly inflammatory,

01:06.733 --> 01:10.269
a skill very much not on display
this week when he visited Israel

01:10.270 --> 01:12.838
and met prime minister
Benjamin netanyahu.

01:12.839 --> 01:15.174
Kushner psented the prime
minister with a gift,

01:15.175 --> 01:16.842
a gift signed by
President Trump.

01:16.843 --> 01:20.512
It was a map of Israel that
includes the Israeli-occupied

01:20.513 --> 01:21.346
golan heights.

01:21.347 --> 01:22.881
John: Wow.

01:22.882 --> 01:26.318
All else aside, a
map is a shitty gift,

01:26.319 --> 01:29.955
and getting it from Jared
kushner is the shittiest way to

01:29.956 --> 01:30.622
receive it.

01:30.623 --> 01:32.958
It'd be like if you got a
bouquet of dead fish for your

01:32.959 --> 01:35.327
birthday delivered
by Matt lauer.

01:35.328 --> 01:37.896
No, and also, no.

01:37.897 --> 01:38.564
Both no.

01:38.565 --> 01:43.135
But much more importantly, that
map is a huge symbolic gesture.

01:43.136 --> 01:45.971
The golan heights is an area
that virtually the entire

01:45.972 --> 01:49.508
international community
considers occupied Syrian rrity,

01:49.509 --> 01:52.644
so it's a willfully provocative
move with a finishing touch that

01:52.645 --> 01:53.979
is pure Trump.

01:53.980 --> 01:58.183
The word there, top
right, just circled there,

01:58.184 --> 02:02.921
"nice." John: Holy shit.

02:02.922 --> 02:05.390
I guess the only really
surprising thing there is that

02:05.391 --> 02:10.362
Trump clearly spelled "noice"
wrong, because it's n-o-i-c-e.

02:10.363 --> 02:12.664
Any of this year's eight
spelling bee co-champions could

02:12.665 --> 02:13.332
ha tolyou that.

02:13.333 --> 02:14.900
Well, three of them
could -- you know,

02:14.901 --> 02:16.401
the three who actually
deserved to win.

02:16.402 --> 02:18.003
They know who they are.

02:18.004 --> 02:20.906
But for now, let's
move on to Tennessee,

02:20.907 --> 02:24.042
rated one of the 49 best states
in the country by "obvious

02:24.043 --> 02:26.612
references to Florida" magazine.

02:26.613 --> 02:29.014
Tennessee's state legislature
has been embroiled in a major

02:29.015 --> 02:31.049
scandal for the past month, and
while it may not be the most

02:31.050 --> 02:34.386
important thing in the world,
every details spectacular.

02:34.387 --> 02:37.322
It involves republican speaker
of the house Glen casada,

02:37.323 --> 02:39.992
a family values conservative,
and his chief of staff,

02:39.993 --> 02:43.495
Cade cothren, who, it's emerged,
has a history of sending some

02:43.496 --> 02:45.797
pretty racist text messages.

02:45.798 --> 02:48.967
In an exchange with casada,
cothren appears to refer to a

02:48.968 --> 02:52.371
west Tennessee district
with this black people meme.

02:52.372 --> 02:54.940
In a text with other
friends, cothren says,

02:54.941 --> 02:58.911
"black people are idiots,"
and insists that tampa bay

02:58.912 --> 03:03.682
quarterback jameis Winston be
called a "thug n-word." You

03:03.683 --> 03:05.617
referred to jameis
Winston as a thug [bleep].

03:05.618 --> 03:08.153
How can you justify that?

03:08.154 --> 03:11.323
John: Okay, so it's not super
surprising that a Tennessee

03:11.324 --> 03:13.992
republican and his top aide
are being flagrantly racist,

03:13.993 --> 03:16.461
especially when one of them
is called Cade -- y'know,

03:16.462 --> 03:19.965
the name you get when the
name "cha fucks a gatorade.

03:19.966 --> 03:24.503
But also, for the record, that
reporter doesn't get to say the

03:24.504 --> 03:25.437
n-word either.

03:25.438 --> 03:29.474
Inact, there's only one old
white man who is allowed to say

03:29.475 --> 03:30.809
the n-word, and it's this guy.

03:30.810 --> 03:32.311
His name is Cole Swanson.

03:32.312 --> 03:33.912
He lives in a sleepy
little Maine town.

03:33.913 --> 03:36.315
He's a former Navy man and a
retired schoolteacher who never

03:36.316 --> 03:38.216
remarried after his
beloved wife, Celia,

03:38.217 --> 03:40.819
passed away after 55
blissful years of marriage.

03:40.820 --> 03:43.388
These days, around evening time,
you can find Cole down by the

03:43.389 --> 03:44.056
docks.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.124
He likes watching the fishing
boats come in at sunset,

03:46.125 --> 03:49.161
says there's a quiet
and noble poetry to it.

03:49.162 --> 03:52.297
Anyway, in 2007, it was
unanimously decided that Cole is

03:52.298 --> 03:54.666
the only ite y who's allowed
to say the full n-word.

03:54.667 --> 03:57.336
But, friends, he never does.

03:57.337 --> 03:59.004
And that's why he was chosen.

03:59.005 --> 04:04.977
Anyway -- anyway, speaker of the
house casada initially defended

04:04.978 --> 04:07.779
his chief of staff, suggesting
he'd been framed by liberals.

04:07.780 --> 04:11.283
And yet, if you can believe
it, which you definitely can,

04:11.284 --> 04:13.652
that defense quickly fell apart.

04:13.653 --> 04:17.055
The text messages also included
this selfie that cothren had

04:17.055 --> 04:18.690
taken at 2:15 A.M.

04:18.690 --> 04:20.492
During a trip to Colorado.

04:20.493 --> 04:23.762
He texted "tripping balls
out of my mind" at 2:15.

04:23.763 --> 04:27.232
"Craziest experience
of my entire life.

04:27.233 --> 04:31.570
Acid, cocaine, weed." After
a 2015 trip to the Dominican

04:31.571 --> 04:35.807
Republic, cothren also texted,
"just did a gram of cocaine in

04:35.808 --> 04:38.977
my office." It was
sent at 10:38 A.M.

04:38.978 --> 04:40.278
on a workday.

04:40.279 --> 04:42.581
John: Okay, okay, okay.

04:42.582 --> 04:45.984
The emphasis on what time of day
these events occurred is a bit

04:45.985 --> 04:49.121
weird there in that it seems to
suggest the main issue here was

04:49.122 --> 04:50.055
scheduling.

04:50.056 --> 04:53.625
Would noon have been a more
appropriate time to blow a g of

04:53.626 --> 04:56.294
yayo off taxpayer-funded
office furniture?

04:56.295 --> 04:58.363
If chrenad waited until
the dead of night,

04:58.364 --> 05:00.098
snuck back into his
empty office building,

05:00.099 --> 05:02.601
and then took a ski trip
to mount booger sugar,

05:02.602 --> 05:04.136
that would have been
better, would it?

05:04.137 --> 05:05.971
I don't think so.

05:05.972 --> 05:09.341
But cothren's behavior clearly
reflects badly on his boss, who,

05:09.342 --> 05:12.344
incidentally, lobbied to have
welfare benefits stried fm

05:12.345 --> 05:14.112
people who test
positive for drugs.

05:14.113 --> 05:17.315
As for cothren himself, he has
since issued what amounts to an

05:17.316 --> 05:20.452
excuse-planation for those
text messages, saying,

05:20.453 --> 05:22.320
"while I'm not proud of
who I was in the past,

05:22.321 --> 05:25.190
I am proud that I've been able
to achieve so much in the years

05:25.191 --> 05:27.693
since." And that may seem
implausible to you -- these

05:27.694 --> 05:31.029
texts were sent just three
years ago -- but in fairness,

05:31.030 --> 05:34.066
you n gea lot of personal growth
done when you're taking cocaine

05:34.067 --> 05:35.634
at 10:30 in the morning.

05:35.635 --> 05:38.970
And while cothren
wound up resigning,

05:38.971 --> 05:42.474
it was clear that speaker casada
was absolutely culpable here

05:42.475 --> 05:45.744
too, because they seemed on
the same page to a legitimately

05:45.745 --> 05:47.779
disturbing extent.

05:47.780 --> 05:51.249
The latest revelation comes amid
the ongoing text message scandal

05:51.250 --> 05:54.853
involving casada and cothren,
part of which involved an August

05:54.854 --> 05:57.189
2016 incident here
at party fowl,

05:57.190 --> 06:00.792
a restaurant and bar right
on the edge of downtown.

06:00.793 --> 06:04.563
In one exchange, cothren texted
casada boasting about having sex

06:04.564 --> 06:07.132
with a woman in the
bathroom at party fowl.

06:07.133 --> 06:08.133
"I knew it!"

06:08.134 --> 06:11.837
Casada responded, asking,
"r u a minute man?"

06:11.838 --> 06:14.473
"Like father, like
son," said the aide.

06:14.474 --> 06:17.809
The response, "if I'm
happy, then all is good!"

06:17.810 --> 06:20.979
Four days later, cas-pac
reported campaign funds paid out

06:20.980 --> 06:24.716
to party fowl for $180.59.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.384
John: Oh, my god!

06:26.385 --> 06:30.689
I mean, setting aside the
questionable use of campaign

06:30.690 --> 06:33.525
funds, there is no way that
cothran had sex in that

06:33.526 --> 06:34.192
bathroom.

06:34.193 --> 06:36.027
But if anything, that
actually makes it worse,

06:36.028 --> 06:39.364
because the only thing on earth
more shatteringly distasteful

06:39.365 --> 06:42.434
than attempting to impress a
state rep by bragging about

06:42.435 --> 06:45.270
being a sexl disappointment
in the bathroom at a Tennessee

06:45.271 --> 06:49.374
chicken restaurant that serves a
55-ounce bloody Mary topped with

06:49.375 --> 06:52.844
two whole fried cornish
game eight fried okra,

06:52.845 --> 06:58.183
and a whole avocado is
attempting to impress a state

06:58.184 --> 07:01.586
rep by lying in a toilet text
about all the lightning-fast

07:01.587 --> 07:04.222
orgasming you're doin in the
bathroom at said Tennessee

07:04.223 --> 07:05.791
chicken restaurant.

07:05.792 --> 07:08.627
Unfortunately, there's no way
to know what Cade cothren was

07:08.628 --> 07:10.328
really doing in the
bathroom at party fowl.

07:10.329 --> 07:12.030
The only thing we know
for absolute sure is,

07:12.031 --> 07:15.133
whatever he was doing, he didn't
wash his hands after doing it,

07:15.134 --> 07:17.269
because according
to one yelp review,

07:17.270 --> 07:22.174
"the bhroolacked toilet paper
and soap." And look, look, look,

07:22.175 --> 07:24.476
that review was from 2015.

07:24.477 --> 07:27.045
But if you are tempted to give
them the benefit of the doubt --

07:27.046 --> 07:30.048
tempted to say, "maybe party
fowl isn't proud of who it was

07:30.049 --> 07:30.882
in the past.

07:30.883 --> 07:33.885
Maybe it's been able to achieve
so much in the years since,

07:33.886 --> 07:34.553
" don't be.

07:34.554 --> 07:37.989
Because three years later,
"there was no soap and no toilet

07:37.990 --> 07:43.028
paper in the restrooms." Also,
it seems crucial that you know

07:43.029 --> 07:46.998
the floor of that restroom was
"so slippery it was like walking

07:46.999 --> 07:49.334
on ice." Which does make sense.

07:49.335 --> 07:51.770
That floor is probably
filthy with chicken grease,

07:51.771 --> 07:54.406
Cade cothren's rapidly
expelled ejaculate,

07:54.407 --> 07:57.175
and/or the flop sweat he
developed from trying to seem

07:57.176 --> 08:00.478
like Mr. Cool x inront of
Tennessee state rep Glen casada.

08:00.479 --> 08:03.982
Now, clearly, this
story is incredible,

08:03.983 --> 08:07.152
but you should know casada's
announced that he'll meet with

08:07.153 --> 08:09.855
republican leadership tomorrow
to determine a date on which

08:09.856 --> 08:10.522
he'll resign.

08:10.523 --> 08:13.425
Not that he has ch cice there,
having been abandoned by his

08:13.426 --> 08:16.494
party, which overwhelmingly
passed a no-confidence vote in

08:16.495 --> 08:17.162
him.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.231
And while that should
not be surprising,

08:19.232 --> 08:23.435
it's worth noting just how
unusual that now actually is.

08:23.436 --> 08:26.404
In fact, given the heinous
conduct that the republican

08:26.405 --> 08:28.907
party has now
completely normalized,

08:28.908 --> 08:31.209
the sight of them actually
holding one of their own to

08:31.210 --> 08:37.015
account is -- to rrow misused
phrase -- "nice." And now this.

08:37.015 --> 08:40.485
Announcer: And now,
animal planet's "Dr.

08:40.486 --> 08:44.623
Dee: Alaska vet"
is on a mission.

08:44.624 --> 08:45.590
I don't want to be pushy.

08:45.591 --> 08:48.727
It's my first time in town, and
I don't want them to tnk that's

08:48.728 --> 08:51.296
all I'm here for is to
castrate everything in sight.

08:51.297 --> 08:52.697
Are you my first patient?

08:52.698 --> 08:53.899
Can you sit?

08:53.900 --> 08:55.667
Do you want to have
your balls cut off?

08:55.668 --> 08:56.968
We don't want to hurt him.

08:56.969 --> 08:57.936
We just want to castrate him.

08:57.937 --> 08:58.603
One.

08:58.604 --> 08:59.271
Two.

08:59.272 --> 09:03.775
Tiffany, we are going to
go cut some nuts off today.

09:03.776 --> 09:04.442
Is that okay?

09:04.443 --> 09:08.513
The's a lot of dogs and
testicles in this village.

09:08.514 --> 09:09.814
Typical blonde Belgian.

09:09.815 --> 09:12.784
I'm a typical blonde
veterinarian who cuts blonde

09:12.785 --> 09:14.152
Belgian balls off.

09:14.153 --> 09:16.855
Tip the little calf over.

09:16.856 --> 09:18.523
Find the testicles,
take them off,

09:18.524 --> 09:19.891
and you go home and
you have dinner.

09:19.892 --> 09:22.127
He can be as testy as he
wants, because pretty soon,

09:22.128 --> 09:24.663
I'm because pretty soon, I'm
going to have his testes in my

09:24.664 --> 09:25.330
hands.

09:25.331 --> 09:26.665
It seems like every
time I go to Tony's,

09:26.666 --> 09:27.332
something loses its testicles.

09:27.333 --> 09:30.001
I don't know what to say
except she enjoys her work.

09:30.002 --> 09:31.136
John: Moving on.

09:31.137 --> 09:38.109
For oumain story tonight, we're
going to talk about medicine,

09:38.110 --> 09:40.045
the thing that doogie howser
pretended to be able to

09:40.046 --> 09:42.747
practice, leading to 92
deaths and life in prison.

09:42.748 --> 09:44.616
Yeah, that's how the show ended.

09:44.617 --> 09:46.651
You didn't watch long enough.

09:46.652 --> 09:49.054
Specifically, we're going to
talk about medical devices,

09:49.055 --> 09:52.457
the modern-day miracles that
range from contact lenses to

09:52.458 --> 09:55.093
pacemakers that keep hearts
beating to hip replacements that

09:55.094 --> 09:58.596
can transform lives, as this
woman will tell you in a solemn

09:58.597 --> 09:59.264
testimonial.

09:59.265 --> 10:02.300
I wasery frhtened to
do a hip replacement.

10:02.301 --> 10:05.303
I really didn't want to
do a hip replacement.

10:05.304 --> 10:07.939
And she got the hip replacement,
and she's better than new.

10:07.940 --> 10:10.942
It's just fascinating
to see her.

10:10.943 --> 10:14.579
She's dancing as if she never
got a hip replacement, you know?

10:14.580 --> 10:17.182
John: Admit it, you didn't
see that story ending with a

10:17.183 --> 10:19.417
breakdancing group of
50-year-olds called -- and this

10:19.418 --> 10:23.888
is true -- "momz in da hood."
And you're going to be even more

10:23.889 --> 10:26.157
surprised when I tell you
they're actually here tonight.

10:26.158 --> 10:29.260
♪ ♪ Please welcome
momz in da hood!

10:29.261 --> 10:31.196
♪ ♪ They're not here.

10:31.197 --> 10:32.364
They're not here.

10:32.365 --> 10:33.531
They're not here.

10:33.532 --> 10:35.467
Of course they're not here!

10:35.468 --> 10:39.738
You think they're coming to a
post- "game of thrones" hbo?

10:39.739 --> 10:41.673
They're momz in da hood!

10:41.674 --> 10:44.009
They have better places to be!

10:44.010 --> 10:47.512
It would be a waste of
their valuable time.

10:47.513 --> 10:50.582
The medical device
industry is huge.

10:50.583 --> 10:55.053
They constitute a $156-billion
market in the U.S., and more

10:55.054 --> 10:56.554
people have one
than you'd think.

10:56.555 --> 11:00.859
About 32 million Americans --
that's 1 in 10-have at least one

11:00.860 --> 11:03.228
medical device implanted
in their bodies.

11:03.229 --> 11:06.097
That's right, all these years
we've been waiting anxiously for

11:06.098 --> 11:09.401
the robot apocalypse, and it
turns out the robot apocalypse

11:09.402 --> 11:10.902
was insi us the whole time.

11:10.903 --> 11:15.874
And while medical devices can
undeniably do tremendous good

11:15.875 --> 11:18.743
and save lives, they can
also cause real problems.

11:18.744 --> 11:20.645
And you're probably
aware of some of them,

11:20.646 --> 11:22.981
thanks to personal injury
lawyer ads like these.

11:22.982 --> 11:26.184
Have you or loved one had
complications after a knee

11:26.185 --> 11:28.253
replacement or revision surgery?

11:28.254 --> 11:30.522
Have you or a loved one
had hernia mesh implanted

11:30.523 --> 11:32.090
specifically for hernia repair?

11:32.091 --> 11:35.160
Have you or a loved one had an
ivc filter implanted to prevent

11:35.161 --> 11:36.528
blood clots from
reaching the lungs?

11:36.529 --> 11:38.797
Have you or a loved one
developed a drug-resistant

11:38.798 --> 11:41.332
bacterial infection or a
superbug after undergoing an

11:41.333 --> 11:44.002
ercp procedure using
a duodenoscope?

11:44.003 --> 11:48.073
John: Yes, actually, yes, I do
have a loved one who's developed

11:48.074 --> 11:50.408
a drug-resistant bacterial
infection or superbug after

11:50.409 --> 11:53.745
undergoing an ercp procedure
using a duodenoscope.

11:53.746 --> 11:58.049
And may I say, I thank god the
card categories at hallmark have

11:58.050 --> 11:59.651
gotten so specific.

11:59.652 --> 12:00.885
I had options on that one.

12:00.886 --> 12:05.023
Now, while it's easy to roll
your eyes at ads like those,

12:05.024 --> 12:07.692
the problems that they
are citing are very real.

12:07.693 --> 12:11.329
Medical devices can malfunction,
sometimes in horrifying fashion.

12:11.330 --> 12:14.499
Just imagine a defective
defibrillator painfully shocking

12:14.500 --> 12:17.735
you multiple times or a
malfunctioning Insulin pump

12:17.736 --> 12:18.803
giving you the wrong dose.

12:18.804 --> 12:21.106
Well, both of those
things have happened.

12:21.107 --> 12:23.775
In fact, a massive recent
investigation found more than

12:23.776 --> 12:29.180
80,000 deaths and 1.7 million
injuries possibly linked to

12:29.181 --> 12:32.383
medical devices were reported
to e fdin the past decade.

12:32.384 --> 12:34.686
And while you'd naturally
assume that medical devices are

12:34.687 --> 12:37.155
extensively tested before
they're put on the market,

12:37.156 --> 12:39.257
that is not
necessarily the case.

12:39.258 --> 12:43.761
Even devices that go inside you
may never have been subjected to

12:43.762 --> 12:44.496
a clinical trial.

12:44.497 --> 12:48.233
And don't feel bad if you're
suddenly surprised by that.

12:48.234 --> 12:50.935
One researcher found many
doctors aren't aware of this

12:50.936 --> 12:52.170
either.

12:52.171 --> 12:55.640
We were surprised to see how
little surgeons knew in our

12:55.641 --> 12:59.410
study about the approval
process for devices,

12:59.411 --> 13:02.113
that some of the surgeons
seemed to think that, well,

13:02.114 --> 13:03.648
the fda had taken care of this.

13:03.649 --> 13:06.151
That of course these devices
had been tested in humans.

13:06.152 --> 13:09.988
John: That's terrifying that
even your doctor may not know

13:09.989 --> 13:12.190
that you're essentially being
treated like a Guinea pig.

13:12.191 --> 13:15.326
And nobody wants to be treated
like a Guinea pig unless it

13:15.327 --> 13:18.029
means you get your o hanng water
bottle that you can suck on from

13:18.030 --> 13:21.065
your bed, which actually sounds
completely delightful to me.

13:21.066 --> 13:25.470
So tonight, let's talk about how
medical devices get approved.

13:25.471 --> 13:28.072
And before we start, the nature
of this story means there are

13:28.073 --> 13:30.441
two clips you'll see
that are a little gross.

13:30.442 --> 13:33.444
So before each one, I'm going
to say a safe word, "opossum,

13:33.445 --> 13:36.814
" and flash it on screen with a
sound effect like this: [Siren

13:36.815 --> 13:39.751
wails] Basically, when you
see that, if you're squeamish,

13:39.752 --> 13:41.419
you'll know to look away.

13:41.420 --> 13:44.756
And now that you have been
fairly warned, let's begin.

13:44.757 --> 13:48.026
For many years, medical devices
were hardly regulated at all.

13:48.027 --> 13:50.695
Instead, the fda produced
sternly worded public

13:50.696 --> 13:54.199
information messages like
this: Today's doctors, drugs,

13:54.200 --> 13:57.969
and medical devices truly work
medical miracles for young and

13:57.970 --> 14:01.472
old alike, but there are
some as phony as a $3 bill.

14:01.473 --> 14:05.276
Like this zeta
applicator, for example,

14:05.277 --> 14:08.780
which has claimed to cure
arthritis with "z-rays." There

14:08.781 --> 14:10.248
are no z-rays.

14:10.249 --> 14:12.650
John: He was right, of course.

14:12.651 --> 14:15.053
Z-rays wouldn't be
discovered until 2011,

14:15.054 --> 14:17.789
when they were identified as
the powerful sexual radiation

14:17.790 --> 14:19.290
emanating from zayn Malik.

14:19.291 --> 14:20.158
Feel the zs.

14:20.159 --> 14:23.595
Feel the zs right now
burrow into your soul.

14:23.596 --> 14:28.032
But in the 1970s, congress
passed a law giving the fda the

14:28.033 --> 14:30.068
authority to approve
medical devices,

14:30.069 --> 14:32.570
and you might assume that,
on the basis of that,

14:32.571 --> 14:35.740
every single device
is fda approved.

14:35.741 --> 14:38.643
But in fact, far more of them
are instead something called

14:38.644 --> 14:42.447
"fda cleared," and that is
a distinction with a big

14:42.448 --> 14:46.784
difference, because fda cleared
is a much lor bar to clear.

14:46.785 --> 14:49.587
You've probably seen the phrase
"fda cleared" on products like

14:49.588 --> 14:53.324
this anti-aging laser treatment,
but it can mean very little.

14:53.325 --> 14:55.760
Even the sharks on
"shark tank" know this.

14:55.761 --> 14:57.495
Watch their response when
someone pitched them an

14:57.496 --> 15:01.432
acupressure band and tried to
pull the whole fda-cleared card.

15:01.433 --> 15:05.069
Hey, romy, is there any proof
that this actually works?

15:05.070 --> 15:07.505
It's an fda-cleared
medic device.

15:07.506 --> 15:08.840
That's not an answer
to the question.

15:08.841 --> 15:09.507
No, that's not what I'm asking.

15:09.508 --> 15:10.608
John: Yeah, cubes is right.

15:10.609 --> 15:12.043
When is he not?

15:12.044 --> 15:13.878
My man cubes nailed it there.

15:13.879 --> 15:18.716
Because saying something's fda
clead is in no way proof that a

15:18.717 --> 15:20.184
device actually works.

15:20.185 --> 15:22.954
It's a phrase that can promise
way more than it delivers.

15:22.955 --> 15:25.823
Like when a cereal describes
itself as "part of a complete

15:25.824 --> 15:28.293
breakfast." That doesn't
really mean anything.

15:28.294 --> 15:31.029
Anything can technically be
part of a complete breakfast.

15:31.030 --> 15:33.665
If you ingest it alongside
oatmeal, yogurt, granola,

15:33.666 --> 15:35.566
fruit salad, and a
glass of orange juice,

15:35.567 --> 15:41.005
eakfast.s part of a complete
and the way most products get

15:41.006 --> 15:44.542
cleared is through a loophole
in the system called the 510(K)

15:44.543 --> 15:45.209
Pathway.

15:45.210 --> 15:47.679
It wasn't actually a bad idea
when they initially came up with

15:47.680 --> 15:48.346
it.

15:48.347 --> 15:51.182
Basically, the fda wouldn't make
companies go through a strenuous

15:51.183 --> 15:55.553
testing process if their device
was substantially similar to one

15:55.554 --> 15:56.521
that hadome fore.

15:56.522 --> 15:58.323
That way, they wouldn't
stifle innovation.

15:58.324 --> 16:00.958
But it was only supposed
to apply narrowly.

16:00.959 --> 16:05.330
The problem is, nowadays more
than 80% of medical devices are

16:05.331 --> 16:10.335
clearethroh the 510(K) Loophole,
including around 400 implanted

16:10.336 --> 16:12.770
medical devices every year
-- those are the ones that go

16:12.771 --> 16:14.639
inside your body.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.442
And that whole idea of being
"substantially equivalent" to

16:17.443 --> 16:20.011
devices that came before has
some real problems with it

16:20.012 --> 16:22.580
because it can essentially
become a high-stakes game of

16:22.581 --> 16:25.016
"telephone." Let me
show you: In 2008,

16:25.017 --> 16:27.952
a company called depuy received
fda clearance for a hip

16:27.953 --> 16:31.589
replacement based on its
substantial equivalence to six

16:31.590 --> 16:34.392
previous devices, all of which
were cleared because of their

16:34.393 --> 16:37.995
similarity to devices before
that and devices before that and

16:37.996 --> 16:40.431
before that, all the way back to
hips that were on the market in

16:40.432 --> 16:42.066
1975.

16:42.067 --> 16:45.803
Now, incredibly, some of those
devices had since been taken off

16:45.804 --> 16:48.506
the market by their
manufacturers because of their

16:48.507 --> 16:49.474
high failure rates.

16:49.475 --> 16:53.745
But under fda rules, depuy could
still use them as a basis for

16:53.746 --> 16:55.179
getting their hips cleared.

16:55.180 --> 16:58.683
And the thing is, depuy's hip
really would have benefited from

16:58.684 --> 17:00.084
clinical testing
in human beings,

17:00.085 --> 17:01.486
because therwas big problem.

17:01.487 --> 17:03.888
While it may've looked
similar to its predecessors,

17:03.889 --> 17:07.058
it was crucially different in
that both its ball and socket

17:07.059 --> 17:10.060
were made out of metal, and it
turns out that when metal rubs

17:10.061 --> 17:12.696
against metal, bad
things can happen,

17:12.698 --> 17:15.299
which sounds like the tagline
for a movie about a masturbating

17:15.300 --> 17:16.300
robot.

17:16.300 --> 17:20.505
You'll -- you'll notice that we
didn't actually come up with a

17:20.506 --> 17:23.741
funny fake name for that movie
because the perfect name for a

17:23.742 --> 17:26.109
movie about a masturbating
robot already exists,

17:26.111 --> 17:32.450
and it's "chappie." But those
metal-on-metal hips began to

17:32.451 --> 17:36.187
degrade with wear-and-tear,
and the consequences wergrim

17:36.188 --> 17:40.258
orthopedic surgeon Dr. Herbert
huddleston of tarzana testified

17:40.259 --> 17:45.062
at trial he's taken out dozens
of metal-on-metal hips th fled.

17:45.063 --> 17:46.230
In the worst cases...

17:46.231 --> 17:48.766
The bone and the soft tissues
around the hip started to look

17:48.767 --> 17:52.069
like pieces of cheese, except
pitch-black pieces of cheese.

17:52.070 --> 17:55.673
Sometimes we get in there and it
looks like it's filled with old

17:55.674 --> 17:57.108
oil that you've
drained from your car.

17:57.109 --> 17:57.775
John: Opossum!

17:57.776 --> 17:58.643
Opossum!

17:58.644 --> 17:59.410
[Siren wails] Shit!

17:59.411 --> 18:00.077
Shit!

18:00.078 --> 18:01.679
I meant to say it
before the clip.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.247
Soy, tt was an opossum.

18:03.248 --> 18:03.981
That was one of them.

18:03.982 --> 18:05.516
I won't miss the next one.

18:05.517 --> 18:06.184
That's on me.

18:06.185 --> 18:11.422
Anyway, depuy's parent company
has since spent more than $3

18:11.423 --> 18:14.992
billion to settle thousands of
lawsuits over their metal hip

18:14.993 --> 18:15.693
implants.

18:15.694 --> 18:18.763
And you feel that this could've
been avoided if an outside agcy

18:18.764 --> 18:21.365
had just had a closer eye
on what depuy was doing,

18:21.366 --> 18:23.568
because the company
-- being, you know,

18:23.569 --> 18:27.238
a company -- was excitedly
trying to put as many of its

18:27.239 --> 18:28.739
hips in people as possible.

18:28.740 --> 18:32.210
Just watch depuy's sales force
celebrate the early success of

18:32.211 --> 18:33.678
its metal hips.

18:33.679 --> 18:36.948
"Taking shares of business"
was the theme of a depuy sales

18:36.949 --> 18:39.350
conference in 2008.

18:39.351 --> 18:44.622
This video, shown to the jury,
stars depuy's then-top marketing

18:44.623 --> 18:47.959
guru alongside
costumed alligators,

18:47.960 --> 18:52.129
a bloody man with a hatchet,
and a giant metal hip implant.

18:52.130 --> 18:55.233
John: Now, you probably have
a lot of questions there,

18:55.234 --> 18:56.601
and if you're like
me, the first one is,

18:56.602 --> 19:00.605
"why include an axe murderer
in your parade about medical

19:00.606 --> 19:01.806
implants?"

19:01.807 --> 19:04.509
I can only assume it's a rdi
as-themed reference to the

19:04.510 --> 19:07.912
axeman of New Orleans, a mostly
forgotten serial killer who

19:07.913 --> 19:10.181
stalked the streets of
the big easy in 1918,

19:10.182 --> 19:12.984
apparently threatening anyone --
and this is true -- who wasn't

19:12.985 --> 19:14.085
joyi jazz enough.

19:14.086 --> 19:17.889
And that is an admirably deep
cut, although if I'm honest,

19:17.890 --> 19:22.059
I would have preferred them
to have put at least as much

19:22.060 --> 19:25.897
research into metal poisoning as
they did into early 20th century

19:25.898 --> 19:26.931
jazz-loving serial killers.

19:26.932 --> 19:30.902
And 's n just the sales force
who were amped about the success

19:30.903 --> 19:31.869
of depuy's hips.

19:31.870 --> 19:33.538
One of the people
who helped design it,

19:33.539 --> 19:36.807
Dr. Thomas schmalzried, was
excited too -- although not

19:36.808 --> 19:39.677
entirely for the reasons you'd
hope a doctor would be excited

19:39.678 --> 19:42.413
about a new medical device,
because he even made an

19:42.414 --> 19:46.417
appearance to pump up depuy's
sales force at that meeting with

19:46.418 --> 19:49.420
his special schmalzreid charm.

19:49.421 --> 19:52.991
Did you know that the first
billion is the hardest?

19:55.127 --> 19:59.397
Billion here, billion there,
pretty soon it adds up to some

19:59.398 --> 20:01.400
real money.

20:03.268 --> 20:06.771
Anyone here wanna go for two?

20:06.772 --> 20:08.105
[Audience cheers] I'm
gonna say that again.

20:08.106 --> 20:11.609
Does anyone here
wanna go for two?

20:11.610 --> 20:13.611
[Audience cheers] John:
Now, I know that sounds bad,

20:13.612 --> 20:16.013
but I'm sure if some of the
patients who had used his

20:16.014 --> 20:18.349
product were there, they too
would have stood and cheered.

20:18.350 --> 20:20.885
And then, you know, collapsed
in a heap because their hips are

20:20.886 --> 20:22.453
now pitch-black cheese.

20:22.454 --> 20:25.723
And if you're wondering why
a doctor should be so excited

20:25.724 --> 20:29.961
about sales, depuy paid him $20
million in royalties for his

20:29.962 --> 20:31.662
role in helping to
design their sale.

20:31.663 --> 20:36.100
Including a cut of every and if
I may paraphrase a deeply smarmy

20:36.101 --> 20:41.272
man, 20 billion here, 20 billion
ther pretty soon it adds up to

20:41.273 --> 20:42.173
some real money.

20:42.174 --> 20:44.176
Mmm.

20:45.711 --> 20:48.646
But I'll say this for
metal-on-metal hips,

20:48.647 --> 20:50.681
at least they can be removed.

20:50.682 --> 20:52.483
It's not easy, and it's
sometimes dangerous,

20:52.484 --> 20:53.884
but it can be done.

20:53.885 --> 20:57.588
It's much harder to do that with
certain types of surgical mesh,

20:57.589 --> 21:00.224
another fda-cleared device.

21:00.225 --> 21:03.327
Very basically, mesh is
implanted in the tissue,

21:03.328 --> 21:06.130
which then heals around
it, sealing it in,

21:06.131 --> 21:09.200
which can make it risky to take
out without damaging surrounding

21:09.201 --> 21:10.034
tissue and organs.

21:10.035 --> 21:13.804
Meshes were initially cleared
by the fda for hernias,

21:13.805 --> 21:16.507
but a few years backthey were
also cleared for use on vaginal

21:16.508 --> 21:20.344
tissue, in many cases without
having had to undergo any

21:20.345 --> 21:21.746
clinical trials.

21:21.747 --> 21:23.414
And things did not go well.

21:23.415 --> 21:28.052
And ahead of the next clip,
I am going to say opossum.

21:28.053 --> 21:30.221
[Sir wails] Not because you're
about to see anything gross,

21:30.222 --> 21:32.623
but because of what
you're about to hear.

21:32.624 --> 21:35.926
It felt like a cheese
grater inside of me.

21:35.927 --> 21:40.531
It felt like the material
was pulling on the muscles,

21:40.532 --> 21:43.067
and I'd get shooting pains.

21:43.068 --> 21:47.405
You almost felt like there was
something inside of you that was

21:47.406 --> 21:50.941
like sandpaper, back and
forth, every time you'd walk.

21:50.942 --> 21:51.609
John: That is viouy horrifying.

21:51.610 --> 21:52.943
There is absolutely no
circumstance in which you should

21:52.944 --> 21:54.278
feel like there is sandpaper in
your groin, apart, of course,

21:54.279 --> 21:55.613
from when a cat is
going down on you.

21:55.614 --> 21:56.313
That's the only time.

21:56.314 --> 21:59.350
That's the only time.

21:59.351 --> 22:04.356
And even then, even then there
are real problems involved.

22:07.325 --> 22:07.992
Even then.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.026
Take it down.

22:09.027 --> 22:10.361
Take it down.

22:10.362 --> 22:15.499
The good news -- the good news
is that the fda recently ordered

22:15.500 --> 22:18.569
vaginal mesh manufacturers to
stop selling their product.

22:18.570 --> 22:21.305
And as for metal-on-metal
hips, going forward,

22:21.306 --> 22:22.973
they won't be fda cleared.

22:22.974 --> 22:25.376
Instead, they'll have to go
through the much more rigorous

22:25.377 --> 22:28.112
process that gets
you fda approved.

22:28.113 --> 22:31.315
It requires that a high-risk
device be tested on humans,

22:31.316 --> 22:35.252
which is great, but even
the approval system has its

22:35.253 --> 22:35.920
problems.

22:35.921 --> 22:38.589
For one thing, the fda relies
on manufacturers to do their own

22:38.590 --> 22:41.525
clinical testing, and those
tests can be very limited.

22:41.526 --> 22:44.829
And for just one example of the
approval system's shortcomings,

22:44.830 --> 22:48.399
look at essure, metal coils that
were marketed as permanently

22:48.400 --> 22:50.534
implanted birth control
devices for women.

22:50.535 --> 22:53.170
Essure's manufacturer, in its
application for fda approval,

22:53.171 --> 22:57.708
claimed that "99% of women
clical studies rated their

22:57.709 --> 23:00.845
comfort with the device
as 'good to excellent,

23:00.846 --> 23:02.146
'" and the fda approved it.

23:02.147 --> 23:05.950
And yet, 15 years later, the
fda had received over 32,

23:05.951 --> 23:09.253
000 reports of problems
with essure, including pain,

23:09.254 --> 23:11.555
dislocation of the device,
genital hemorrhage,

23:11.556 --> 23:14.992
and perforated organs, none of
which really sound particularly

23:14.993 --> 23:16.961
"good" or "excellent" to me.

23:16.962 --> 23:20.865
And if you're having trouble
squaring that with the sky-high

23:20.866 --> 23:23.367
satisfaction rate in
essure's clinical studies,

23:23.368 --> 23:25.970
some of the participants in it
say there may be a reason for

23:25.971 --> 23:27.071
that.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.774
The first time I saw the
question "rate your comfort of

23:29.775 --> 23:33.577
wearing the device," I
said, "what does this mean?"

23:33.578 --> 23:35.045
I'm not wearing anything.

23:35.046 --> 23:37.448
This is something that's
implanted inside of my body.

23:37.449 --> 23:40.651
The nurse said,
"can you feel it?"

23:40.652 --> 23:43.287
And I said, "I can feel
pain in my abdomen.

23:43.288 --> 23:48.192
Where that pain is coming from,
I don't know." And she said,

23:48.193 --> 23:51.262
"then you need to rate it as
excellent." They would say,

23:51.263 --> 23:53.430
"are you happy
with the product?"

23:53.431 --> 23:55.800
I would say, "no."
And they would say,

23:55.801 --> 23:57.001
"but you're not pregnant?"

23:57.002 --> 24:01.639
I would say, "correct." "Well,
then it's doing its job.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.908
So you have to be happy
with that." John: Okay,

24:03.909 --> 24:07.511
but just because something is
technically fulfilling its job

24:07.512 --> 24:11.549
does not mean you have
to be happy with it.

24:11.550 --> 24:14.518
Pennywise technically fulfills
all the requirements of a

24:14.519 --> 24:17.054
birthday clown, but when you
book him for your kid's fifth

24:17.055 --> 24:19.190
birthday party a
it esn't go well,

24:19.191 --> 24:22.459
you should not be obliged
to rate him as excellent.

24:22.460 --> 24:24.695
So I guess the big
question here is,

24:24.696 --> 24:27.865
how can you know if a device
is potentially harmful?

24:27.866 --> 24:30.534
And unfortunately, good
information is actually very

24:30.535 --> 24:31.435
difficult to find.

24:31.436 --> 24:36.040
For a start, one estimate
suggested less than half of 1%

24:36.041 --> 24:40.077
of medical device failures are
even reported to the fda, which,

24:40.078 --> 24:42.112
when you think about it,
is genuinely remarkable.

24:42.113 --> 24:45.716
100% of rude waiters
are reported to yelp,

24:45.717 --> 24:47.985
and those aren't
killing anybody.

24:47.986 --> 24:51.055
In fact, public reporting of
issues with devices is so bad,

24:51.056 --> 24:53.757
many patients have been forced
to learn about problems in

24:53.758 --> 24:57.494
less-than-ideal ways, like from
that alarmingly alert woman in a

24:57.495 --> 25:00.631
law firm commercial or
often even Facebook.

25:00.632 --> 25:03.868
A couple of months ago, the fda
heldearings to alert women to

25:03.869 --> 25:06.003
potential issues
with breast implants.

25:06.004 --> 25:09.473
But for years and years
and year before that,

25:09.474 --> 25:13.744
women were finding out simply
by warningne another online.

25:13.745 --> 25:16.046
The private group is called
"breast implant illness and

25:16.047 --> 25:20.651
healing by Nicole," and today
it has more than 79,000 members.

25:20.652 --> 25:23.120
I was like, "this is
unbelievable that this can

25:23.121 --> 25:26.624
happen to so many people." Page
after page, that's my story,

25:26.625 --> 25:27.491
that's my story.

25:27.492 --> 25:28.759
Everyone has the same symptoms.

25:28.760 --> 25:32.329
John: Yeah, they found out
through Facebook groups,

25:32.330 --> 25:35.232
traditionally the least
reliable source of information,

25:35.233 --> 25:38.502
right below
horoscopes, "infowars,

25:38.503 --> 25:41.338
" and a mole person screaming
in the subway tunnels.

25:41.339 --> 25:44.074
Look, this system
clearly needs reform.

25:44.075 --> 25:45.409
And don't just
take that from me.

25:45.410 --> 25:48.545
Eight years ago, t instute of
medicine actually called for an

25:48.546 --> 25:50.514
end to the 510(K)
Loophole -- you know,

25:50.515 --> 25:53.183
the one that hips and mesh went
through -- saying it should be

25:53.184 --> 25:56.186
replaced by a regulatory
framework based on sound

25:56.187 --> 25:56.921
science.

25:56.922 --> 25:59.723
And that framework does not need
to be so strict that innovation

25:59.724 --> 26:03.193
is stifled, just not so lax
that people are getng needlessly

26:03.194 --> 26:03.861
hurt.

26:03.862 --> 26:07.264
At the very least, you would
hope that implanted devices

26:07.265 --> 26:10.868
would undergo clinical testing
before being put inside you.

26:10.869 --> 26:13.804
But any time that meaningful
reforms have been suggested,

26:13.805 --> 26:16.840
device manufacturers have
lobbied hard and helped defeat

26:16.841 --> 26:17.508
them.

26:17.509 --> 26:19.109
Because of course they have.

26:19.110 --> 26:21.345
Any changes would mean
they'd have to work hard,

26:21.346 --> 26:23.580
and nobody wants to work harder.

26:23.581 --> 26:26.984
You think we like doing these
heavily researched stories?

26:26.985 --> 26:29.553
You think this was fun for us?

26:29.554 --> 26:31.155
Hbo makes us do this!

26:31.156 --> 26:34.325
If it was up to us, we'd work
one day a week and every segment

26:34.326 --> 26:36.894
would be two minutes long and
have a title like "pillows and

26:36.895 --> 26:42.132
how they are soft, bye-bye."
But, look -- that would be fun.

26:42.133 --> 26:46.870
But until our current system
is improved, unfortunately,

26:46.871 --> 26:49.239
patients have to be
their own advocates,

26:49.240 --> 26:52.776
and experts advise researching
any implanted device and asking

26:52.777 --> 26:55.212
questions like, "is
there an alternative?"

26:55.213 --> 26:57.214
"Can the device be removed
if something goes wro?"

26:57.215 --> 26:59.683
And "how long has the
device been on the market?"

26:59.684 --> 27:03.120
Because just because something
is new doesn't necessarily mean

27:03.121 --> 27:05.823
it's better or even
that it's been tested.

27:05.824 --> 27:09.026
The point here is, our medical
device system needs serious

27:09.027 --> 27:09.693
attention.

27:09.694 --> 27:12.296
And until it is fixed, it would
be nice if people were alerted

27:12.297 --> 27:15.466
to the flaws with our process
with the same urgency with which

27:15.467 --> 27:18.402
they're alerted to the
flaws with our devices.

27:18.403 --> 27:19.470
Attention.

27:19.471 --> 27:21.739
If you or a loved one are
thinking about getting an

27:21.740 --> 27:25.576
implanted medical device, you
may want to listen the fuck up,

27:25.577 --> 27:28.345
because it turns out the fda
is so far up medical device

27:28.346 --> 27:31.081
manufacturers' asses you can
only locate them with this

27:31.082 --> 27:32.483
duodenoscope.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.752
And thanks to that,
manufacturers are getting rich,

27:34.753 --> 27:37.388
doctors are getting rich, and
patients are getting their

27:37.389 --> 27:39.390
insides turned into
oil and cheese.

27:39.391 --> 27:40.057
Sorry.

27:40.058 --> 27:40.724
Opossum.

27:40.725 --> 27:44.595
[S wails] You and your loved
ones need to know it can take

27:44.596 --> 27:46.997
years before the public finds
out about problems with a new

27:46.998 --> 27:49.967
device, and in the meantime,
your best source of information

27:49.968 --> 27:53.203
may be fucking Facebook, and the
only thing you should ever learn

27:53.204 --> 27:56.607
from Facebook is which of your
friends has the ugliest baby.

27:56.608 --> 27:57.374
It's Greg's.

27:57.375 --> 28:02.746
So act now to protect
yourself fore it's too late.

28:02.747 --> 28:05.182
Basically treat medical devices
like guys who have played

28:05.183 --> 28:05.849
Batman.

28:05.850 --> 28:09.053
Some are great, but new ones
aren't necessarily better,

28:09.054 --> 28:11.722
and there are a few you
definitely don't want to let

28:11.723 --> 28:12.956
inside your body.

28:12.957 --> 28:15.592
And if hearing about
duodenoscopes and sandpaper

28:15.593 --> 28:17.428
vaginas have made
you uncomfortable,

28:17.429 --> 28:19.296
as long as it hasn't
made you pregnant,

28:19.297 --> 28:22.000
I'm afraid you have to rate
your experience as excellent.

28:27.072 --> 28:29.673
[Bell dings] John:
That's our show.

28:29.674 --> 28:32.910
Thanks so much for watching.

28:32.911 --> 28:35.512
See you next week.

28:35.513 --> 28:36.814
Good night!
