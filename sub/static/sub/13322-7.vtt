00:00.122 --> 00:01.530
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.531 --> 00:03.122
You wrote the code in LabVIEW?

00:03.123 --> 00:05.752
- Do it again in Java.
- Why are you being such a bitch?

00:05.763 --> 00:07.424
Because bitches get things done.

00:07.458 --> 00:09.959
We both know that I'm
not smart enough for you,

00:09.994 --> 00:11.294
and that's why you won't date me.

00:11.328 --> 00:12.762
You broke my heart.

00:12.797 --> 00:14.697
Is that Mariana?

00:14.732 --> 00:16.499
What the hell is she doing?

00:16.534 --> 00:18.234
I don't think I'm really
ready to smoke pot.

00:18.269 --> 00:20.203
The thing is we're not smoking it.

00:20.237 --> 00:21.888
We're eating it.

00:21.923 --> 00:25.284
So I looked into Kyle's
alibi witness, Patrick Molloy,

00:25.305 --> 00:27.870
and it turns out that he was arrested

00:27.878 --> 00:29.918
for lewd and lascivious acts with a minor.

00:29.952 --> 00:32.075
I think I might know why
the prosecutor didn't want

00:32.083 --> 00:33.708
Kyle's lawyer to see the forensics report.

00:33.751 --> 00:35.769
It says that the killer was right-handed,

00:35.810 --> 00:37.228
but Kyle's left-handed.

00:37.276 --> 00:40.589
I have some tax issues with the IRS.

00:40.623 --> 00:42.235
Are we going to lose our home?

00:57.716 --> 01:01.031
- So?
- So?

01:01.353 --> 01:05.239
- That was...
- Pretty terrible.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.270
Oh! Yeah.

01:07.294 --> 01:09.080
- The worst.
- Ever.

01:12.975 --> 01:15.522
- You know what I was thinking?
- Hm?

01:15.642 --> 01:17.872
I was thinking maybe we could try again.

01:17.903 --> 01:19.855
- You know, see if...
- You can could do better?

01:19.855 --> 01:21.227
- Me?
- Hey.

01:21.995 --> 01:23.674
You started it, woman.

01:25.630 --> 01:28.013
I'm gonna have to show you my "A" game.

01:28.271 --> 01:31.234
It sure was good for your "B" game.

01:35.687 --> 01:38.121
Let's see, I think I have
some left-over Chinese.

01:38.850 --> 01:41.546
- Did you hear something?
- No.

01:42.165 --> 01:43.716
How about pizza?

01:43.724 --> 01:45.691
- What are you in the mood for?
- Oh, whatever's easiest.

01:45.707 --> 01:47.705
I got a lot of homework tonight anyway.

01:58.465 --> 02:01.395
I'll, uh, let AJ know we're home.

02:08.026 --> 02:09.907
Uh, yeah?

02:10.026 --> 02:11.529
Hey, it's me.

02:11.649 --> 02:16.074
Uh, I didn't end up working that
extra shift after all, so, uh...

02:16.419 --> 02:18.535
yeah, I invited Brandon to dinner

02:18.575 --> 02:21.451
and, uh, he's here. We're both here.

02:21.490 --> 02:23.567
So, uh, if you, uh...

02:23.687 --> 02:27.462
- how's pizza sound?
- Uh, yeah, pizza sounds good.

02:27.494 --> 02:30.539
- I can't find my bra.
- Uh...

02:32.960 --> 02:34.864
Ow!

02:41.023 --> 02:43.523
Uh, pepperoni, mushroom?

02:43.947 --> 02:46.729
Uh, yeah.

02:48.704 --> 02:51.502
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:51.917 --> 02:53.194
Oh, hey.

02:53.218 --> 02:56.007
Hey.
- Hey.

02:56.127 --> 02:57.967
Uh, we were just...

02:58.049 --> 02:59.950
- studying for Calculus.
- Chemistry.

03:02.543 --> 03:04.695
Uh, Callie, do you want
to join us for dinner?

03:04.698 --> 03:07.715
Uh, no, actually, I, um, have to...

03:08.279 --> 03:10.426
I have to be home...

03:10.724 --> 03:13.185
but thanks.

03:14.423 --> 03:15.919
- Bye.
- Bye.

03:15.927 --> 03:17.455
Bye.

04:19.659 --> 04:22.578
The only way that we'll be
ready in time for competition

04:22.578 --> 04:25.261
is if the whole robotics
team is working 24/7:

04:25.291 --> 04:27.473
before school, during lunch,

04:27.478 --> 04:29.890
after school, free periods, even nights.

04:30.242 --> 04:32.865
Well, is it okay if I
schedule in some time to sleep?

04:32.985 --> 04:34.915
You can sleep when it's over.

04:36.931 --> 04:38.486
Well, look who decided to join us.

04:38.506 --> 04:40.156
Sorry, I was doing homework at AJ's,

04:40.196 --> 04:41.360
and we lost track of time.

04:41.380 --> 04:43.071
Okay, family dinner is not an option.

04:43.076 --> 04:45.328
It's the only time I get to
see all of your beautiful faces.

04:45.343 --> 04:47.400
Oh yeah? Then why don't
you make Brandon come?

04:47.520 --> 04:50.294
Um, Brandon was actually
at Mike's for dinner.

04:50.341 --> 04:51.353
How nice.

04:51.373 --> 04:52.657
Maybe if we're lucky, one of these days

04:52.667 --> 04:54.487
we'll be graced with his presence too.

04:57.913 --> 04:59.673
Mariana, please put your cell phone away

04:59.673 --> 05:00.798
at the dinner table.

05:00.918 --> 05:02.531
Well, can I be excused then?

05:02.541 --> 05:03.394
- Yes.
- No!

05:03.404 --> 05:04.683
What? We just sat down.

05:04.693 --> 05:06.348
But she's the first female team leader,

05:06.363 --> 05:07.611
it's a big deal.

05:10.159 --> 05:11.742
Are there any more potatoes?

05:11.774 --> 05:13.660
- He speaks!
- What?

05:14.417 --> 05:15.180
Who?

05:15.832 --> 05:17.121
You and your brother are gonna

05:17.146 --> 05:18.615
eat us out of house and home.

05:18.640 --> 05:19.865
Uh, speaking of house,

05:19.890 --> 05:21.751
has anyone heard from Gabe lately?

05:22.568 --> 05:24.052
Uh, no, why?

05:24.097 --> 05:26.550
Because he hasn't been by to
work on the garage in days,

05:26.577 --> 05:27.939
and I'm starting to
think he's blowing us off.

05:27.959 --> 05:29.589
Well, he was... he was here yesterday

05:29.619 --> 05:31.666
- when I got home from school.
- He was?

05:31.786 --> 05:33.416
Doesn't look like he did much.

05:33.450 --> 05:35.462
Well, he's gonna get it done!
What's the hurry, anyway?

05:35.502 --> 05:36.887
Hey, watch your tone.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.622
It's the principle of the matter, Jesus.

05:38.627 --> 05:40.071
All right? We did something for Gabe,

05:40.097 --> 05:42.373
and in exchange he promised
to do something for us.

05:42.399 --> 05:44.661
- He needs to keep his word.
- Well, he is.

05:45.007 --> 05:46.095
Jeez.

06:09.549 --> 06:13.205
- Hello?
- Hey, sorry, did I... did I wake you?

06:13.265 --> 06:15.592
No, no, what's... What's up?

06:15.657 --> 06:18.772
Um, yeah, is everything okay?

06:18.818 --> 06:21.064
I mean, you've been kind
of MIA, and my moms are

06:21.184 --> 06:22.920
starting to wonder what's going on.

06:22.965 --> 06:24.595
Yeah, sorry.

06:24.620 --> 06:28.377
I, uh, haven't been
feeling that good, so...

06:28.412 --> 06:29.606
Uh, okay.

06:30.074 --> 06:31.873
Okay, well, um, look, you...

06:31.883 --> 06:33.588
you got to get back here,

06:33.618 --> 06:37.265
because they really want to
get this remodel finished.

06:37.290 --> 06:38.223
Got it.

06:38.294 --> 06:39.919
I'll be there tomorrow...

06:40.144 --> 06:42.271
- for sure.
- Okay.

06:47.167 --> 06:49.704
The rent on the houses
big enough for all of us

06:49.714 --> 06:51.811
is higher than our mortgage.

06:52.574 --> 06:53.953
What about apartments?

06:54.605 --> 06:56.572
Really? We're all gonna
move into an apartment

06:56.582 --> 06:58.633
with no yard? You think
the kids bicker now?

06:58.658 --> 07:00.864
When they're all on top of
each other with nowhere to go...

07:00.894 --> 07:04.310
how are you okay with losing our home,

07:04.325 --> 07:06.025
all the memories that we have here?

07:06.065 --> 07:07.845
I am not okay. I'm not okay at all,

07:08.156 --> 07:09.249
but what am I supposed to do?

07:09.254 --> 07:12.615
- Let the IRS throw my dad in jail?
- That's a stretch, Lena.

07:12.661 --> 07:13.804
That's not what you told him,

07:13.819 --> 07:16.518
and what if he does drive
himself off a cliff like he said?

07:16.583 --> 07:19.236
He was being melodramatic.
He's not gonna kill himself.

07:19.261 --> 07:20.957
All the stress might kill him.

07:21.313 --> 07:23.318
I still say that we should

07:23.338 --> 07:27.491
talk to the IRS, you know?
See what other options we have.

07:27.506 --> 07:28.965
And what if they do
offer us a payment plan?

07:28.965 --> 07:30.058
Where is that money gonna come from?

07:30.083 --> 07:31.363
We barely make enough money right now

07:31.383 --> 07:32.512
as it is to pay our bills.

07:32.522 --> 07:35.626
We'll take on other jobs if we have to.

07:39.534 --> 07:40.797
What about...

07:41.314 --> 07:42.899
asking your mom?

07:43.215 --> 07:45.051
No, no, absolutely not.

07:45.061 --> 07:47.910
I'm not asking my mother
to bail out your father.

07:47.945 --> 07:50.021
That's not what I...

07:50.503 --> 07:52.599
You'd be asking her to save our home.

07:52.609 --> 07:54.174
I'm not asking my mother for money, Lena.

07:54.189 --> 07:55.548
It's just not gonna happen.

07:59.139 --> 08:01.126
- I know that this is heart-breaking...
- Oh.

08:01.196 --> 08:02.485
... for all of us.

08:05.580 --> 08:07.154
But my dad, he needs the money

08:07.169 --> 08:09.196
that we're gonna get from
the sale, the money that he...

08:09.206 --> 08:11.524
he gave us in the first
place to buy this place.

08:13.679 --> 08:15.665
How can you expect me to

08:15.846 --> 08:19.727
save our asses and then let
my parents hang out to dry?

08:49.440 --> 08:52.204
_

09:22.653 --> 09:24.970
Careful, Mason.

09:27.738 --> 09:30.692
Okay, Mason, no coloring
on my sheet music!

09:30.733 --> 09:33.105
Okay, you can draw in your coloring books.

09:33.150 --> 09:35.372
- That's it, okay?
- Did he? I'm sorry.

09:35.432 --> 09:37.233
It's okay, it's not a big deal.

09:37.834 --> 09:39.720
No, no, Mason! That's not a toy!

09:40.046 --> 09:42.127
Cort, can you please?

09:42.318 --> 09:44.199
Mason, do what Brandon says.

09:44.204 --> 09:46.161
Okay? That's not yours.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.308
Sorry, I'm just going
over my work schedule.

09:48.965 --> 09:51.107
I mean, he's not really hurting it, right?

09:54.703 --> 09:57.988
No, I guess not. Okay, um, I got to go.

09:58.008 --> 09:59.387
Oh, don't forget you're picking up Mason

09:59.402 --> 10:00.756
from preschool this afternoon.

10:01.238 --> 10:03.099
Oh, damn. Well, I was...

10:03.129 --> 10:04.884
I was hoping I would get
some time to practice.

10:04.889 --> 10:06.459
There's not a lot of
time before the audition.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.622
I get it, but I mean if we're
gonna make rent this month,

10:08.657 --> 10:09.856
I can't miss work again.

10:09.891 --> 10:12.178
Well, maybe Eddie can take him?

10:12.203 --> 10:13.773
Well, until this custody thing is settled

10:13.803 --> 10:15.985
I can't ask Eddie to take
him when it's not his turn.

10:16.006 --> 10:19.076
I have to prove that I
can handle Mason by myself.

10:26.151 --> 10:27.425
Detective, really?

10:27.591 --> 10:30.445
Yeah, I've been thinking
about it for a while.

10:31.002 --> 10:33.731
You ready to leave the beat
for the good old boys club?

10:34.634 --> 10:38.371
It pays more. I've got five
kids going off to college

10:38.401 --> 10:40.186
sometime soon, hopefully.

10:40.427 --> 10:42.023
Those good old boys are
just gonna have to get ready

10:42.043 --> 10:43.723
for this good old girl.

10:44.576 --> 10:45.629
So, um,

10:46.221 --> 10:47.821
I came home early yesterday.

10:47.867 --> 10:49.216
Uh-huh.

10:50.385 --> 10:52.206
AJ and Callie were in his room,

10:52.677 --> 10:55.355
and, uh, I'm pretty sure they were, uh...

10:55.400 --> 10:57.462
- Having sex?
- Yeah.

10:58.726 --> 11:00.813
I mean, It's Callie. I
thought you should know.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.015
Yeah, I appreciate it.

11:03.060 --> 11:04.399
So what? I should...

11:04.670 --> 11:07.304
tell AJ they can't be doing
that in my place any more, right?

11:07.424 --> 11:10.127
I'm not really sure we can make 'em stop.

11:10.132 --> 11:11.761
You know, remember what
you were like at that age.

11:12.028 --> 11:14.205
No.

11:14.370 --> 11:15.820
Well, if they're gonna be having sex,

11:15.845 --> 11:18.222
I'd rather them do it some place safe.

11:18.235 --> 11:20.694
You know, not a car or God knows where.

11:20.725 --> 11:23.587
You will have a conversation
with him about wearing a condom?

11:23.618 --> 11:24.621
Yeah, of course.

11:24.741 --> 11:26.793
But... I mean, what?
You're okay with this?

11:28.057 --> 11:30.238
Uh, I guess.

11:30.765 --> 11:31.948
Are you?

11:32.826 --> 11:34.080
Yeah, I guess,

11:34.552 --> 11:36.994
but, um, Brandon was with me.

11:38.870 --> 11:40.265
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

11:40.295 --> 11:41.705
I wonder if it was weird for him?

11:41.730 --> 11:43.109
Oh, please, it was a long time ago.

11:43.134 --> 11:45.862
They're siblings now. Plus,
Brandon's living with his girlfriend.

11:45.982 --> 11:46.966
I guess so.

11:47.011 --> 11:49.483
Have anything to say
about how that's going?

11:50.718 --> 11:52.202
Well, he seems pretty
determined to live with her

11:52.212 --> 11:54.841
- until he goes off to Juilliard.
- If he gets in.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.526
If not, I don't know how he can afford

11:56.546 --> 11:58.312
to pay rent on an apartment.

11:58.482 --> 12:00.639
Wait a minute? He's paying the rent?

12:01.647 --> 12:02.956
And a lot more.

12:03.388 --> 12:05.674
He has no more money left.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.332
What do you mean? What about the
money for the hand settlement?

12:08.753 --> 12:10.303
He gave it all to her.

12:10.906 --> 12:12.635
- What?
- Hmm.

12:30.374 --> 12:31.938
The mailbox is full and cannot accept

12:31.979 --> 12:34.028
any messages at this time. Good-bye.

12:35.329 --> 12:37.982
_

12:42.045 --> 12:44.142
_

12:44.162 --> 12:45.355
_

12:48.750 --> 12:51.830
_

13:14.101 --> 13:17.612
Can I help you or do I need to
invest in a "no loitering" sign?

13:17.788 --> 13:20.305
Sorry, um, I, um...

13:20.732 --> 13:23.520
I heard that you could, um, hook me up.

13:24.649 --> 13:26.289
You know, with some, uh...

13:27.659 --> 13:30.468
- green.
- You mean pot?

13:30.964 --> 13:32.344
Sure, what kind?

13:32.519 --> 13:34.460
Uh, do you have gummy worms?

13:34.500 --> 13:37.052
I don't carry edibles.
I meant, "What strain?"

13:37.243 --> 13:38.767
Indica or sativa?

13:38.842 --> 13:41.179
I, uh, usually go with Indigo.

13:41.209 --> 13:43.221
- Indica?
- Right, yeah.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.825
Do you want it loose or rolled?

13:44.990 --> 13:47.242
- Um...
- Never mind, rolled.

13:47.262 --> 13:48.601
Got it.

13:51.305 --> 13:54.179
Every time I finish picking
up, Hurricane Mason's

13:54.204 --> 13:56.079
already made another
lap around the apartment.

13:56.114 --> 13:57.925
Oh, no need to apologize.

14:01.652 --> 14:03.598
Uh, hey, I'm sorry for stopping by.

14:03.613 --> 14:05.920
- I didn't have your number.
- Oh, that's fine.

14:06.266 --> 14:08.151
Can I get you something to drink?

14:08.211 --> 14:09.396
No thanks.

14:10.143 --> 14:11.978
I was hoping to talk to you about Brandon.

14:12.545 --> 14:13.654
Okay.

14:14.130 --> 14:15.695
Look, first of all, I just want to say

14:15.735 --> 14:17.660
that I'm supportive of your relationship.

14:17.692 --> 14:20.253
I think you're a very nice girl

14:20.261 --> 14:22.229
and you clearly care for Brandon.

14:22.877 --> 14:24.396
It's just that, uh...

14:24.699 --> 14:26.700
all this is a lot of responsibility

14:27.135 --> 14:29.803
at any age, but especially at 18.

14:29.804 --> 14:31.423
I mean, he hasn't even
graduated high school.

14:31.428 --> 14:34.021
Look, I didn't ask for
Brandon to move in with me.

14:34.036 --> 14:36.925
I have no doubt that this was his idea.

14:37.301 --> 14:39.503
Just like I'm sure you didn't
ask him for the money he gave you.

14:39.518 --> 14:41.093
I didn't ask for the money.

14:41.133 --> 14:42.547
Look, that's the thing about Brandon.

14:42.557 --> 14:43.921
He doesn't have to be asked.

14:43.962 --> 14:45.592
He sees a pretty girl in need,

14:45.602 --> 14:47.462
and he feels like he has to save her.

14:47.512 --> 14:48.892
Well, I don't need any saving.

14:48.897 --> 14:51.043
I can take care of myself and my son.

14:51.095 --> 14:53.884
Well, I'm sure you can, which is why I...

14:54.302 --> 14:55.670
I was hoping you could,

14:55.686 --> 14:57.884
uh, encourage him to move back home.

14:58.693 --> 15:01.396
I'm not sure what I could say.

15:01.467 --> 15:02.711
Well, I mean,

15:03.047 --> 15:04.537
you could, uh...

15:05.189 --> 15:07.255
tell him that it's

15:07.501 --> 15:11.343
confusing for your son to live
with a man that isn't his father.

15:12.877 --> 15:14.919
You think I'm confusing my son?

15:15.280 --> 15:17.246
You know, your son's pretty confused too.

15:17.276 --> 15:19.232
- Yeah, I agree.
- But not about me.

15:19.543 --> 15:22.237
I mean, do you have any
idea why he's living here?

15:22.398 --> 15:24.088
I mean, I think I do, yeah.

15:24.118 --> 15:26.330
It's because he's not
comfortable living at home.

15:26.586 --> 15:29.094
- Why is that?
- Because his moms are blaming him

15:29.124 --> 15:30.970
for everything that happened with Callie.

15:31.216 --> 15:33.197
They think it's all his responsibility,

15:33.223 --> 15:35.334
and he doesn't want to live with them

15:35.344 --> 15:36.804
looking over his shoulder every day

15:36.827 --> 15:38.464
like he's some kind of creep.

15:39.396 --> 15:40.615
What do you mean? What do you mean,

15:40.631 --> 15:42.899
- "Everything that happened with Callie"?
- They had sex!

15:44.483 --> 15:45.983
And the only reason I'm telling you this

15:46.007 --> 15:47.667
is 'cause I'm tired of everyone acting

15:47.682 --> 15:49.452
like Brandon's the one being selfish,

15:49.492 --> 15:51.313
when really he's just
trying to make things easier

15:51.348 --> 15:52.742
for everybody else.

15:52.963 --> 15:54.428
And his moms know?

15:54.548 --> 15:55.712
Yes.

15:57.021 --> 15:58.897
And that's why there's nothing I can say

15:58.912 --> 16:00.331
to get him to move home.

16:18.945 --> 16:21.874
_

16:35.559 --> 16:36.988
All right!

16:37.320 --> 16:38.789
All right.

16:52.693 --> 16:54.919
So... so did you find Molloy?

16:54.950 --> 16:57.272
We did, um...

16:57.673 --> 17:01.141
Unfortunately, he
doesn't remember that day,

17:01.648 --> 17:04.694
but he's not saying that you
weren't at the rec center, he just...

17:04.815 --> 17:06.679
you know, it was four years ago.

17:06.713 --> 17:08.945
But the good news is
we found something else.

17:08.955 --> 17:10.681
We've been going through
your lawyers files,

17:10.681 --> 17:13.133
and there was a missing
page in the forensics report,

17:13.167 --> 17:16.377
and it said that the killer
most likely was right-handed.

17:16.423 --> 17:18.103
Well, I'm left-handed.

17:18.123 --> 17:21.288
I know, so Aaron's gonna
talk to the lawyers at JJC,

17:21.292 --> 17:23.806
hopefully it'll be enough
for them to take on your case.

17:23.820 --> 17:26.207
You know, if they can prove that this page

17:26.327 --> 17:28.199
was deliberately withheld
from your attorney,

17:28.199 --> 17:29.894
this could be huge.

17:30.772 --> 17:32.597
What's wrong?

17:35.501 --> 17:38.460
I spent a lot of time trying
to get used to the idea

17:38.490 --> 17:40.386
that I was probably gonna die in prison.

17:42.171 --> 17:44.297
It's been a while since I've had any hope.

17:52.110 --> 17:53.123
No.

17:53.660 --> 17:56.178
No, no, okay, what were you thinking

17:56.193 --> 17:58.093
- running wire on the exterior?
- Well...

17:58.665 --> 18:01.123
You're just asking for it
to get cut on the field.

18:01.183 --> 18:02.974
- But I...
- These kinds of mistakes

18:02.984 --> 18:04.132
- are gonna get us slaughtered.
- Okay.

18:04.167 --> 18:06.835
- All right, um...
- Here, I'll do it myself.

18:10.908 --> 18:12.457
Someone's a little tense today.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.720
Okay, we don't have time to keep building

18:14.740 --> 18:15.959
and rebuilding this robot

18:15.994 --> 18:18.106
if we want to be ready for
competition in three days.

18:18.111 --> 18:20.514
But you do have time to go visit Nick?

18:22.299 --> 18:24.506
Can we not talk about that right now?

18:25.253 --> 18:27.335
So you're not stressed about it?

18:27.411 --> 18:28.427
He's locked up.

18:28.461 --> 18:30.992
Not that locked up if
he has access to a phone

18:31.012 --> 18:33.179
and is texting you constantly.

18:34.965 --> 18:36.568
Oh, and where have you been?

18:36.602 --> 18:39.392
- I... I hit my head and...
- Whatever!

18:39.422 --> 18:41.454
Just help Emma mount the shooter.

18:42.075 --> 18:43.876
Where is my soldering iron?

18:44.728 --> 18:46.559
Yeah, don't worry. I'm sure I'm fine.

18:46.584 --> 18:48.149
It's probably just a concussion.

18:51.369 --> 18:53.775
She's been like this all day.

18:53.776 --> 18:56.822
Yeah, welcome to the
last 16 years of my life.

18:59.630 --> 19:01.405
- What did you do?
- Um...

19:01.525 --> 19:04.239
I just got into it with a nail gun.

19:04.645 --> 19:07.865
You should see the other guy... gun.

19:08.477 --> 19:10.167
Never mind.

19:10.784 --> 19:12.510
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah,

19:12.705 --> 19:14.973
I mean, a little. You
don't have any aspirin,

19:15.003 --> 19:16.348
- do you?
- Yeah.

19:19.668 --> 19:21.645
So what are you doing with a nail gun?

19:21.685 --> 19:24.799
Um, I was helping Gabe out
with the garage remodel.

19:25.236 --> 19:26.690
He hasn't been showing up,

19:26.700 --> 19:28.676
so my moms are kind of freaking out,

19:28.796 --> 19:31.625
but can we not tell Mariana?

19:31.795 --> 19:33.145
Okay.

19:34.805 --> 19:36.706
Do you think he's blowing the job off?

19:36.751 --> 19:39.003
No, no, no, he's... he's sick.

19:39.123 --> 19:41.410
No, he wouldn't do that. He's a good guy.

19:41.530 --> 19:44.053
Well, I think you're a
good guy for helping him.

19:45.834 --> 19:50.248
Uh, a good enough guy to, uh...

19:50.931 --> 19:52.431
have another chance...

19:53.549 --> 19:54.808
with you?

19:55.997 --> 19:57.056
I...

19:57.376 --> 20:00.351
I haven't had time to think about that.

20:00.471 --> 20:03.772
- Okay.
- Hey! Less talky, more worky.

20:03.806 --> 20:05.267
Ooh, can I have some of those?

20:05.277 --> 20:06.892
My head is killing me!

20:08.912 --> 20:10.959
Yeah, if her head doesn't kill her,

20:10.959 --> 20:12.393
I might have to.

20:19.485 --> 20:21.435
Hey, what are you doing here?

20:22.724 --> 20:24.875
Well, don't sound so happy to see me.

20:24.941 --> 20:26.895
Sorry, I just, um...

20:27.717 --> 20:29.969
What's going on? Is everything okay?

20:30.731 --> 20:32.231
Uh, well,

20:32.276 --> 20:34.036
I've just been thinking
a lot about the house.

20:34.061 --> 20:35.937
You know? Um...

20:37.281 --> 20:39.694
So I asked my mom if
she would help us out.

20:40.020 --> 20:42.598
- And?
- Well, she doesn't have the cash...

20:43.090 --> 20:45.161
but she offered to sell her condo,

20:45.407 --> 20:46.671
move in with Will.

20:47.147 --> 20:49.505
- Move into his motor home?
- Which...

20:49.625 --> 20:51.115
You know, we can't let her do.

20:51.135 --> 20:52.705
For his sake as much as hers.

20:54.043 --> 20:55.266
Well, I, uh...

20:55.597 --> 20:58.165
I made a call today as well

20:58.220 --> 21:00.211
to the IRS, and, um...

21:00.437 --> 21:03.627
They said that they would
stay the lien on the home

21:03.632 --> 21:06.186
if we could come up with $2,000 a month.

21:07.831 --> 21:10.680
Okay, so we could work
nights and weekends.

21:10.700 --> 21:12.149
Seven days a week.

21:12.179 --> 21:15.081
Just to never see the
kids or each other...

21:16.119 --> 21:18.055
just to pay for a house that...

21:18.933 --> 21:20.537
wouldn't feel like a home

21:20.783 --> 21:22.353
'cause we're never there.

21:31.425 --> 21:33.622
So I guess we'll call
the real estate agent?

21:36.335 --> 21:38.809
First we need to talk to the kids.

21:41.106 --> 21:42.124
Yeah.

21:45.128 --> 21:46.783
Okay, Mason, so,

21:47.184 --> 21:49.473
the blanket is an island,

21:49.498 --> 21:52.595
and the rest of the floor is the ocean.

21:52.613 --> 21:55.454
So you don't want to fall off the blanket,

21:55.488 --> 21:57.635
or else you'll fall in
the water and drown. Right?

21:57.755 --> 21:59.772
Wow, drowning?

21:59.792 --> 22:01.905
Is that like a new parenting technique?

22:03.301 --> 22:05.694
Uh. I just... I really have to practice,

22:05.700 --> 22:07.922
so unless you want to watch him?

22:08.301 --> 22:10.522
No, no, looks like you got it covered.

22:10.960 --> 22:14.425
Oh, um, thank you for putting my, uh...

22:14.545 --> 22:16.592
you know, in my backpack yesterday.

22:17.151 --> 22:18.344
Yeah.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.400
Oh, no, no, no, no. Hey, buddy,

22:25.428 --> 22:26.917
no, no, this isn't a toy.

22:27.289 --> 22:29.210
All right, go back on the island

22:29.232 --> 22:31.674
or else you'll get eaten by the sharks.

22:31.696 --> 22:32.697
All right?

22:33.370 --> 22:34.574
Stay there.

22:42.638 --> 22:43.705
Hey.

22:44.417 --> 22:45.725
What's up?

22:48.779 --> 22:50.208
Are you stoned?

22:51.818 --> 22:53.833
Uh, a skunk...

22:53.871 --> 22:55.300
sprayed me.

22:55.349 --> 22:57.730
A stoned skunk.

22:57.949 --> 22:59.492
You're high.

22:59.689 --> 23:01.124
Are you freaking kidding me?

23:01.129 --> 23:02.459
What is wrong with you, Jude?

23:02.503 --> 23:03.461
Upstairs, now!

23:03.581 --> 23:06.652
Oh, you need a shower before
moms get home and bust your ass.

23:06.713 --> 23:08.081
Hurry up!

23:28.986 --> 23:30.321
Mason?

23:33.989 --> 23:35.352
Mason!

23:38.702 --> 23:40.098
Mason!

23:46.815 --> 23:50.231
No, no, no, no, no. Mason!

24:06.608 --> 24:08.628
Mason, where are you!

24:09.313 --> 24:10.654
In here!

24:20.550 --> 24:21.892
I don't think I've ever seen that

24:21.913 --> 24:23.873
blue eye shadow on you before.

24:29.084 --> 24:30.458
Mariana, could you put that away please?

24:30.502 --> 24:32.963
Sorry, one sec. I have so
much to do on this robot,

24:32.990 --> 24:34.320
I should really be in the lab right now.

24:34.342 --> 24:36.077
Okay, well, this is not gonna take long.

24:36.094 --> 24:38.809
We just want you guys to know first...

24:39.536 --> 24:41.655
that everything is okay.

24:41.682 --> 24:42.733
We're gonna be fine.

24:42.771 --> 24:45.634
Mason, I would like you
to sit down now, please.

24:46.581 --> 24:47.654
Good job, buddy.

24:47.698 --> 24:50.156
Um, so what's up then?

24:52.147 --> 24:53.616
We, uh...

24:53.922 --> 24:55.531
we're selling the house.

24:55.986 --> 24:58.203
- You're kidding me, right?
- Are you serious?

24:58.219 --> 25:01.061
- We... What? Why?
- For financial reasons.

25:01.094 --> 25:03.141
What's going on with you? Are you okay?

25:04.969 --> 25:07.175
- He bumped his head.
- How'd you do that?

25:07.219 --> 25:09.272
I'm fine, it's nothing. I
just... I have a headache.

25:09.294 --> 25:11.056
Ugh, tell me about it!

25:11.176 --> 25:13.410
So we're losing the only home

25:13.443 --> 25:15.200
that we've ever known? Great.

25:15.244 --> 25:16.968
- Where are we moving to?
- Why do you care?

25:16.974 --> 25:18.742
- You don't even live here any more.
- Hey, Jesus.

25:18.753 --> 25:20.450
Hey, I've lived here longer than you have!

25:20.477 --> 25:22.307
Oh, yeah, and now you're
shacking up with your MILF.

25:22.311 --> 25:23.696
- Jesus, hey!
- What?

25:23.723 --> 25:26.257
- "Mother I'd Like to Facebook."
- Cut it out now.

25:26.301 --> 25:28.168
Wait, are we like broke?

25:28.288 --> 25:29.592
Oh, God,

25:29.619 --> 25:31.064
I'm not gonna get into a decent school.

25:31.103 --> 25:33.533
- Are we gonna be homeless?
- Mariana, listen.

25:35.295 --> 25:37.995
Grandma and Grandpa are
going through a rough patch,

25:38.006 --> 25:40.129
and since they have money
invested in this house,

25:40.146 --> 25:42.505
we... we need to sell it to pay them back.

25:42.548 --> 25:44.300
We're gonna be fine, you guys.

25:44.344 --> 25:46.856
Okay? We're gonna rent
until we can buy a new house.

25:46.873 --> 25:48.592
We're gonna have to live in an apartment?

25:48.641 --> 25:50.874
Mariana, a lot of people
live in apartments.

25:50.924 --> 25:54.459
- Uh-oh.
- Okay, you have got to tell Courtney

25:54.470 --> 25:56.183
that she needs to get
her son under control.

25:56.227 --> 25:58.884
- I can't tell her how to parent her kid.
- Someone should.

25:58.919 --> 26:00.272
- You okay, bud?
- Yes.

26:00.305 --> 26:01.931
- Okay.
- We're gonna go, all right?

26:01.942 --> 26:02.960
- What?
- Come on, Mason.

26:03.321 --> 26:05.057
- Where are you going?
- We're gonna go.

26:05.089 --> 26:07.109
- Say bye, Mason.
- Bye.

26:07.229 --> 26:09.326
- Bye, buddy.
- Mason, bye, buddy.

26:11.750 --> 26:13.529
I can't believe this is happening.

26:13.803 --> 26:15.774
Are we still gonna be
able to go to Anchor Beach?

26:15.894 --> 26:17.679
Of course you will go
to Anchor Beach, honey.

26:17.711 --> 26:19.862
- Now where are you going?
- I don't...

26:19.873 --> 26:21.143
I don't feel so good.

26:22.294 --> 26:23.295
- Jesus!
- Oh my God!

26:23.328 --> 26:25.731
Honey, are you okay? What's going on?

26:30.078 --> 26:31.797
Hi, sweetie!

26:31.835 --> 26:33.515
Oh, were you a good boy for Brandon?

26:33.537 --> 26:35.163
- Yeah.
- Was he?

26:35.185 --> 26:37.074
- Yeah.
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.088
He was pretty good, except
he got into my mom's makeup.

26:39.088 --> 26:40.452
What? How did that happen?

26:40.468 --> 26:41.962
Weren't you watching him?

26:42.023 --> 26:43.714
Well, I was, but it turns out

26:43.736 --> 26:45.701
playing Chopin's Etude Number 10

26:45.740 --> 26:47.803
while watching a toddler
is harder than you think.

26:47.825 --> 26:50.524
Great, like your moms need
another reason to hate me.

26:50.573 --> 26:51.865
They don't hate you.

26:51.898 --> 26:53.874
Mason, dammit!

26:53.994 --> 26:55.636
No, no, no, no! How many times

26:55.664 --> 26:57.065
do I have to have to tell
you? Hands off the keyboard!

26:57.115 --> 26:59.359
- This is not a toy!
- Okay, Brandon, it was an accident.

26:59.392 --> 27:02.074
- No, he needs a time out, Cort!
- Hey, don't yell at my son!

27:02.074 --> 27:05.085
- It's not your place to discipline him!
- Well, somebody needs to.

27:05.205 --> 27:07.482
- I discipline him.
- No, you don't!

27:07.488 --> 27:10.109
You let him run wild! You
don't set any boundaries!

27:10.148 --> 27:11.757
Okay, that's why he's
in our bed every night,

27:11.774 --> 27:13.597
and that's why he ruins our stuff.

27:14.073 --> 27:16.421
- He's out of control!
- Great.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.967
It's good to know what you
think of me as a mother.

27:19.241 --> 27:22.021
- Cort.
- It's time for bed.

27:34.342 --> 27:35.584
What's taking so long?

27:35.628 --> 27:37.588
I don't know.

27:42.914 --> 27:44.710
Do you think he's gonna be okay?

27:45.345 --> 27:47.206
I mean, he's gonna be okay, right?

27:47.423 --> 27:49.264
I'm sure it's nothing serious.

27:49.565 --> 27:52.499
He probably just forgot
to eat lunch or something.

27:57.433 --> 27:58.839
Are you all right?

28:00.251 --> 28:02.752
Just, I still have this freaking headache.

28:04.640 --> 28:06.267
Maybe it's empathy pain.

28:07.717 --> 28:09.748
You know, like twin-tuition.

28:10.870 --> 28:12.654
What? It's a thing.

28:13.946 --> 28:16.317
No, it's not that.

28:18.681 --> 28:21.289
I took some of Jesus's ADHD pills.

28:21.982 --> 28:23.208
Why?

28:23.958 --> 28:25.994
To stay up, to stay focused.

28:27.177 --> 28:29.925
That's like taking speed. Are you crazy?

28:29.941 --> 28:33.006
I'm just so stressed out
about the competition.

28:36.099 --> 28:37.954
You don't need to take pills.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.389
You're brilliant, okay?

28:41.353 --> 28:42.693
And we've got this.

28:42.704 --> 28:44.210
And the whole point of the competition

28:44.221 --> 28:47.296
is to have fun and to
learn something, not...

28:47.620 --> 28:49.202
to be an idiot.

28:50.181 --> 28:51.380
I know.

28:52.705 --> 28:54.703
Promise me you won't take any more.

28:55.808 --> 28:57.198
I won't. I promise.

28:57.740 --> 28:59.306
It was stupid.

29:04.078 --> 29:06.295
Hey, is he okay? What happened?

29:06.415 --> 29:08.392
We're not sure. Apparently he hit his head

29:08.397 --> 29:10.687
earlier in the afternoon, and
then just collapsed after you left.

29:10.698 --> 29:11.952
They just took him for a CAT-scan.

29:11.952 --> 29:13.977
We're just waiting to hear.

29:14.420 --> 29:15.833
Mrs. Foster?

29:16.660 --> 29:19.002
- Did you find anything?
- We did.

29:19.013 --> 29:20.863
Something pretty surprising.

29:22.555 --> 29:23.497
What is that?

29:23.508 --> 29:24.811
- That's a...
- Nail.

29:24.931 --> 29:27.892
As you can see, it's embedded
several inches into his frontal lobe.

29:28.012 --> 29:29.568
Oh my God.

29:29.617 --> 29:32.140
- What?
- First of all, it's not life-threatening,

29:32.173 --> 29:34.450
and we're lucky it didn't
reach his motor cortex.

29:34.510 --> 29:36.054
So he's gonna be okay?

29:36.070 --> 29:38.632
There is a slight chance this
could affect his speech center.

29:38.665 --> 29:40.658
- We won't know until we remove it.
- How...

29:40.696 --> 29:42.180
how did this happen?

29:42.300 --> 29:44.161
Well, has he been using a nail gun?

29:44.281 --> 29:46.093
N... Has he?

29:46.213 --> 29:48.326
No, not on the robot.

29:49.307 --> 29:52.657
Um, he told me that he
was working on your garage,

29:52.684 --> 29:56.303
and that the gun recoiled
and hit him in the head.

29:56.352 --> 29:58.071
What was he doing working on the garage?

29:58.087 --> 30:00.977
I think he was, um,

30:01.004 --> 30:03.095
covering for his birth father.

30:04.431 --> 30:06.281
Why... why wouldn't he say something?

30:06.297 --> 30:07.830
The skull has pain-sensitive nerves,

30:07.857 --> 30:09.407
but there aren't any
within the brain itself,

30:09.412 --> 30:11.980
so he probably didn't realize he
did anything more than nick himself.

30:11.990 --> 30:13.233
Okay, is he awake?

30:13.277 --> 30:15.242
- Is he aware of what's happening?
- We have him sedated

30:15.275 --> 30:16.944
and we're prepping him
for surgery, and Dr. Wong,

30:16.994 --> 30:18.772
our top neurosurgeon, is on her way,

30:18.794 --> 30:20.612
so your son will be in
the best hands possible.

30:20.661 --> 30:23.819
- Can we see him?
- Uh, yes, but just the moms for now.

30:23.846 --> 30:25.138
It's going to be okay.

30:25.324 --> 30:26.710
Okay, don't worry.

30:27.224 --> 30:29.047
Jesus'll be okay.

30:30.935 --> 30:32.506
It's gonna be all right.

30:33.842 --> 30:36.896
Hey, Ana called me about Jesus.

30:36.907 --> 30:38.450
What happened? Is he all right?

30:38.855 --> 30:40.536
No, he's not.

30:40.886 --> 30:42.692
He shot himself in the
head with your nail gun.

30:42.735 --> 30:44.586
- What?
- He's got a nail in his head

30:44.602 --> 30:46.245
because you didn't show up to do your job.

30:46.896 --> 30:49.617
Look, I'm sorry, I've
been sick. I didn't...

30:49.650 --> 30:50.980
Just go...

30:51.166 --> 30:52.770
before my moms see you.

30:52.890 --> 30:55.080
I'm... I'm really sorry.

30:55.118 --> 30:57.319
Yeah, well, if he's not okay, it's on you.

31:24.896 --> 31:26.413
So is this something you do now?

31:26.451 --> 31:27.683
You get high?

31:29.309 --> 31:30.568
I don't want to talk about it.

31:30.573 --> 31:33.141
Fine, you can talk to moms.

31:33.869 --> 31:35.445
All right, fine.

31:37.712 --> 31:39.354
It's the first time I've smoked it,

31:39.688 --> 31:40.602
but...

31:41.220 --> 31:43.175
I ate some gummy worms before...

31:43.229 --> 31:44.992
well, like, edibles.

31:45.112 --> 31:46.646
Where'd you get them?

31:47.674 --> 31:50.423
- I'm not kidding. I'll tell them.
- All right! God!

31:52.441 --> 31:54.528
Noah has a medical marijuana card.

31:54.549 --> 31:56.143
- Don't lie to me, Jude.
- I swear.

31:56.164 --> 31:58.112
His mom got it for him for anxiety.

31:58.232 --> 32:00.882
What kind of mom gives
their 15-year-old kid pot?

32:00.898 --> 32:03.022
I don't think it's any worse
than giving him a bunch of pills.

32:03.033 --> 32:03.871
Oh my God.

32:03.914 --> 32:06.750
Look, people use it
for attention problems,

32:06.778 --> 32:08.278
like Jesus.

32:08.305 --> 32:10.320
You don't judge him for
taking his meds, do you?

32:10.347 --> 32:13.632
- No, that is...
- At least weed is natural.

32:15.158 --> 32:16.905
Okay, well, let's be real.

32:16.927 --> 32:19.861
People use it sometimes
as an excuse to get high.

32:19.981 --> 32:21.339
Well, it helped me.

32:21.717 --> 32:23.933
I was a little anxious
before my test the other day,

32:23.977 --> 32:25.925
so I took some. And guess what?

32:25.960 --> 32:27.190
I got an "A."

32:27.426 --> 32:29.807
Seriously, you're getting high at school?

32:30.185 --> 32:32.178
Don't be an idiot, Jude!

32:32.961 --> 32:35.167
Look, if I find out that
you've done it again,

32:35.194 --> 32:37.060
I will go straight to
moms, and I'm not kidding.

32:39.249 --> 32:42.473
- Hey, any word yet?
- No, he's still in surgery.

32:43.760 --> 32:46.201
- Thanks for coming, Mike.
- Yeah, of course.

32:47.559 --> 32:49.726
You get a chance to talk to Courtney?

32:50.290 --> 32:53.696
- Uh, yeah.
- Well, what'd she have to say?

32:54.150 --> 32:56.153
Uh, let's talk about it later.

32:59.005 --> 33:00.092
Who's that?

33:00.806 --> 33:01.988
It's Aaron.

33:03.089 --> 33:04.550
Should I be worried about this guy?

33:04.780 --> 33:07.693
No, we're texting about Kyle.

33:08.076 --> 33:10.383
The JJC's not taking his case.

33:10.503 --> 33:12.671
What about the report that said
the killer was right-handed?

33:12.705 --> 33:14.387
They said it's not enough.

33:14.507 --> 33:15.874
He just can't catch a break.

33:15.909 --> 33:19.139
You know, and what's so unfair
is that he has an alibi witness

33:19.188 --> 33:21.389
who would get him out if
he just told the truth.

33:23.750 --> 33:26.184
I love how much you care
about people, Callie, but

33:26.496 --> 33:29.130
- maybe this time, you ought to just...
- What? Give up?

33:29.137 --> 33:31.886
No, and let Kyle go to a
maximum-security prison,

33:31.925 --> 33:33.610
where he'll be beaten and raped

33:33.643 --> 33:35.961
and treated like a piece of
garbage for the rest of his life?

33:36.625 --> 33:38.363
I didn't mean it like that.

33:38.968 --> 33:40.079
No, I know.

33:40.106 --> 33:42.963
Um, I'm gonna use the restroom, okay?

33:54.791 --> 33:56.921
Hey, so, uh, I've been thinking.

33:58.946 --> 34:01.294
I'm not really comfortable
with you and Callie

34:01.557 --> 34:04.037
being intimate under my roof.

34:05.307 --> 34:07.574
Oh, well, okay.

34:08.569 --> 34:09.938
'Kay.

34:13.156 --> 34:14.293
Callie!

34:14.873 --> 34:15.842
Hey.

34:15.914 --> 34:17.463
Noah, hey.

34:17.643 --> 34:20.199
- How's Jesus?
- Still in surgery.

34:21.010 --> 34:22.927
- Oh, and this is my mom.
- Nicole.

34:22.993 --> 34:25.330
I'm one of the volunteer
chaplains at the hospital,

34:25.369 --> 34:26.507
so we just wanted to come by and see

34:26.562 --> 34:28.610
if there's anything we can
do for you and your family.

34:29.201 --> 34:31.472
Yeah, there is. Um,

34:31.592 --> 34:34.567
look, it's your business if you
want to buy pot for your son,

34:34.599 --> 34:37.106
but I don't want him giving
any more of it to my brother.

34:37.275 --> 34:39.755
- Did you?
- Just once.

34:42.038 --> 34:44.513
I'm sorry.

34:45.623 --> 34:47.704
Maybe it is better if we just go.

34:47.732 --> 34:49.106
Maybe it is, yeah.

35:05.585 --> 35:07.134
Hey.

35:07.325 --> 35:09.400
My love, how you doing?

35:12.065 --> 35:15.508
Jueves cheeseburger, para hermana y...

35:15.847 --> 35:17.605
private taco.

35:19.855 --> 35:21.448
What, baby?

35:22.263 --> 35:25.613
- Psych!
- Ugh!

35:25.646 --> 35:27.912
- What? Come on.
- Jesus, stop.

35:28.602 --> 35:30.841
- Jesus.
- Well, that's too bad,

35:30.885 --> 35:32.357
you know, because it would've
been nice to live in a world

35:32.373 --> 35:34.076
- without your awful jokes.
- Uh-huh.

35:34.196 --> 35:35.839
- Ha.
- Hey, it's a good look for you.

35:35.872 --> 35:38.505
So they went up your
nose and into your brain?

35:38.625 --> 35:41.121
Meh, it probably wasn't too hard.

35:41.241 --> 35:42.922
There's a lot of extra space up there.

35:44.991 --> 35:46.289
Are you in pain?

35:46.579 --> 35:48.276
No, no, it's not bad.

35:48.325 --> 35:49.951
Mm-hmm, well, by the way,

35:49.984 --> 35:51.287
you are banned from using power tools

35:51.314 --> 35:53.033
for the rest of your natural life.

35:53.892 --> 35:56.443
Oh, and you totally don't
deserve to here this, but

35:56.563 --> 35:59.196
Emma told me to tell you quote,

35:59.230 --> 36:00.625
"She's done thinking about it,

36:00.652 --> 36:02.787
and the answer is 'yes.'"

36:05.929 --> 36:07.220
Oh.

36:07.270 --> 36:09.454
I don't think I want to know.

36:09.963 --> 36:13.455
So the realtor wants to
talk about the listing price.

36:16.067 --> 36:18.004
Are you seriously on your phone right now?

36:18.004 --> 36:19.581
You told Noah's mom what we did?

36:19.871 --> 36:23.440
No, I told Noah not to give
you any more gummy worms

36:23.560 --> 36:25.175
and his mother happened to be there.

36:25.739 --> 36:27.480
After all the stupid
stuff that you've done

36:27.513 --> 36:29.188
and I've never told anybody,

36:29.626 --> 36:32.172
you go and tattle on me?

36:32.544 --> 36:33.578
You know what?

36:34.411 --> 36:36.239
I'm never gonna tell you anything again.

36:36.720 --> 36:39.544
So just stay out of my life... for good.

36:41.351 --> 36:44.017
Hey, everybody, come here, come here.

36:46.196 --> 36:48.309
I know that we're all
upset about the house...

36:48.802 --> 36:51.221
but it doesn't matter where we live.

36:51.839 --> 36:53.197
Home is...

36:53.230 --> 36:55.140
it's just where we're all together.

36:58.095 --> 36:59.272
Yes?

37:01.582 --> 37:03.558
You kind of sound like a greeting card.

37:17.976 --> 37:19.399
What are you doing?

37:20.149 --> 37:21.529
My job.

37:22.002 --> 37:24.985
Your job is going to someone
who can keep his commitments,

37:25.105 --> 37:27.106
not put my son in harms way.

37:27.989 --> 37:29.182
Look,

37:29.379 --> 37:31.940
I feel terrible Jesus got hurt.

37:31.984 --> 37:33.424
Okay, but you have to know

37:33.435 --> 37:35.104
that I did not ask him to come in here

37:35.115 --> 37:37.590
- and work for me. I would never do that.
- It doesn't change the fact that he did

37:37.614 --> 37:39.151
because you weren't here, Gabe.

37:40.286 --> 37:43.749
I don't mean to keep
letting him down, and...

37:43.764 --> 37:47.224
I am appreciative of
everything you've done for me.

37:47.235 --> 37:49.270
It certainly doesn't seem that
way, the way you've been acting.

37:49.283 --> 37:51.210
What do you want? I'm struggling here.

37:51.250 --> 37:53.312
With what? What is wrong with you?

37:53.347 --> 37:54.639
What's going on?

37:54.759 --> 37:58.345
I... I don't know what the problem is.

37:58.874 --> 38:01.055
I don't know what's wrong with me.

38:02.185 --> 38:04.081
Have you really been sick, Gabe?

38:04.550 --> 38:05.605
Really?

38:07.674 --> 38:09.206
I just...

38:11.514 --> 38:13.957
I'm really having a hard time, you know...

38:14.299 --> 38:16.839
even getting out of bed in the morning.

38:19.694 --> 38:21.994
Sounds like depression
to me, don't you think?

38:23.868 --> 38:26.128
Yeah, I guess, but

38:26.248 --> 38:28.782
it's not your problem.

38:30.840 --> 38:33.944
Look, peace, okay? Can we just...

38:34.185 --> 38:35.898
just talk to me.

38:36.018 --> 38:39.078
It's stupid for men to feel this way.

38:39.325 --> 38:41.251
If you don't do anything about
it because you think it's stupid,

38:41.273 --> 38:42.609
it's never gonna get better, is it?

38:44.569 --> 38:45.976
I thought...

38:47.798 --> 38:50.316
that when I got off that list that

38:50.858 --> 38:52.976
everything would be normal.

38:53.956 --> 38:56.830
But all I can think about is

38:57.323 --> 39:02.123
how much of my life was wasted...

39:02.819 --> 39:06.979
and how I'm never gonna
get any of that time back.

39:07.833 --> 39:09.853
Yeah, you won't, that sucks.

39:11.429 --> 39:13.170
Now the only thing you can do is get help,

39:13.290 --> 39:15.036
make sure that you don't lose any more.

39:18.917 --> 39:20.685
I really...

39:21.867 --> 39:23.788
need to finish this.

39:27.313 --> 39:28.927
Okay.

39:38.803 --> 39:40.637
Thank you.

39:42.701 --> 39:44.020
- How are you?
- Good.

39:44.798 --> 39:46.933
Excuse me, Mr. Molloy.

39:47.316 --> 39:48.586
Sorry to bother you again.

39:48.602 --> 39:50.584
I already told you,
okay? I don't remember.

39:51.191 --> 39:52.756
Look, I know that's not true.

39:52.789 --> 39:54.951
I know that you remember that
Kyle was at the rec center

39:54.989 --> 39:56.331
the day that Mrs. Johnson was killed

39:56.369 --> 39:58.258
because you talked to his lawyer.

39:59.100 --> 40:01.127
Look, uh, it was four years ago.

40:01.162 --> 40:02.987
Right, I don't remember what
I had for breakfast today,

40:03.025 --> 40:05.221
- so... what can I get you?
- Look, an innocent 17-year-old kid

40:05.221 --> 40:06.857
is gonna spend the rest
of his life in prison

40:06.857 --> 40:10.064
- if you don't tell the truth.
- You need to leave me alone.

40:10.104 --> 40:11.969
Okay? I've got work to do?

40:13.950 --> 40:15.592
My mom's a cop.

40:15.926 --> 40:18.679
We know that you were arrested
right before Kyle's trial...

40:20.404 --> 40:23.179
for lewd and lascivious acts with a minor!

40:23.519 --> 40:26.281
- You need to get the hell out of here.
- And we know you made a deal.

40:26.333 --> 40:28.444
- I said get the hell away from me, bitch!
- Hey!

40:28.456 --> 40:30.340
- Do not touch me!
- What is going on?

40:31.075 --> 40:32.433
- Are you the manager?
- Yes!

40:32.481 --> 40:35.336
Okay, you should know that
you're employing a child molester!

40:36.737 --> 40:38.182
I don't know who this crazy bitch is.

40:38.230 --> 40:40.035
She just came up to me, started screaming.

40:40.096 --> 40:42.566
- Right, you need to leave.
- How can you live with yourself?

40:43.022 --> 40:45.807
- No, seriously, how?
- Do I need to call the cops?

40:46.612 --> 40:48.114
No, I'm going.

40:48.193 --> 40:49.927
You should know this isn't over.

40:51.119 --> 40:52.993
Why don't you take your break?

41:01.287 --> 41:02.360
Hey, it's Molloy again.

41:02.701 --> 41:05.570
That girl I told you about, she came back,

41:05.614 --> 41:07.274
and she knows about the deal we made.

41:07.344 --> 41:09.915
- How?
- I don't know.

41:10.510 --> 41:12.047
She says her mom's a cop.

41:12.494 --> 41:14.302
What the hell is going on?

41:14.350 --> 41:15.725
Beats me.

41:16.364 --> 41:17.620
What's her name again?

41:18.133 --> 41:21.058
Callie Adams-Foster.

41:21.706 --> 41:24.719
All right, I'll handle it.
