Cap'n.

02:01.433 --> 02:03.869
Captain!
Captain, we got Yanks!

02:04.469 --> 02:06.404
Cap'n, we got Yanks!

02:06.904 --> 02:10.273
Cap'n. Cap'n sir,
we got about 20 Federals

02:10.275 --> 02:13.212
comin' up that hillside
and they're mighty pissed, sir.

02:13.579 --> 02:15.213
- Thank you, Sergeant Major.
- Sir.

02:18.450 --> 02:19.552
Look sharp, men!

02:20.385 --> 02:22.054
Eyes forward now.

02:22.887 --> 02:26.425
We did not come
here today to lose.

02:26.958 --> 02:30.295
We came here to run
these Johnny-red sap

02:30.862 --> 02:34.400
all the way back
to the muddy waters of the Gulf.

02:34.867 --> 02:38.905
Let it not be fear
that compels you today.

02:40.438 --> 02:44.109
No, let it be the calm thoughts

02:44.909 --> 02:46.945
of returnin' home to your wives.

02:47.879 --> 02:50.849
Holdin' your sons
and your daughters.

02:51.082 --> 02:55.317
All right boys, we got us
a bunch of feeble-minded Yanks

02:55.319 --> 02:57.323
just lyin' across from us.

02:57.588 --> 03:00.826
They're outnumbered,
cold and scared.

03:01.559 --> 03:04.330
Let it not be the thought
of sleepin' in the cold mud,

03:06.230 --> 03:09.501
but in a warm bed,
clean sheets instead.

03:10.301 --> 03:13.471
It is your job to take
their lives from them this day.

03:14.272 --> 03:18.375
This forest becomes a graveyard
for those northern heathens

03:18.377 --> 03:20.612
that would take your
God-given right from you.

03:21.512 --> 03:22.849
But most importantly,

03:24.982 --> 03:28.521
remember the fresh feelin'
of victory!

03:32.424 --> 03:33.926
Take to mind all that

03:34.225 --> 03:38.027
and we will crush
our enemies on this day.

03:38.029 --> 03:38.563
Now,

03:41.199 --> 03:42.368
dyin' time is here.

03:46.470 --> 03:47.569
Let's go!

03:47.571 --> 03:49.438
Come on!

03:57.115 --> 03:57.916
Charge!

04:08.225 --> 04:09.527
Yeah!

06:13.085 --> 06:18.089
<i>One in Virginia, one in South Carolina</i>

06:18.522 --> 06:21.224
<i>One in the Dakotas,
I just don't remember which one.</i>

06:21.226 --> 06:23.159
<i>I must... There must've been,
I don't even know,</i>

06:23.161 --> 06:24.626
<i>six bottles
of whiskey that night.</i>

06:24.628 --> 06:26.599
Oh, yes.

06:27.265 --> 06:29.364
Kentucky, there was
one in Kentucky.

06:29.366 --> 06:31.700
I tell you what, you wanna
find yourself some trouble,

06:31.702 --> 06:33.535
trouble will find
you in Kentucky.

06:33.537 --> 06:35.340
That is just how it is.

06:35.640 --> 06:38.077
I swear, you don't even
got to go lookin' for it.

06:40.277 --> 06:42.748
Hmm, you're awful quiet Karl.

06:43.614 --> 06:45.215
Somethin' botherin' you?

06:45.217 --> 06:46.318
You wanna know what
I heard all mornin'?

06:47.649 --> 06:48.720
Well, what did ya hear, Karl?

06:50.589 --> 06:52.190
Your goddamn jaw floppin'.

06:55.226 --> 06:57.296
Sound like somebody forgot
to grease the wheel.

06:59.830 --> 07:02.265
Just when I thought you couldn't
possibly be more useless,

07:02.267 --> 07:04.370
turns out you can't
aim for shit either.

07:04.702 --> 07:07.539
You couldn't hit a bear's ass
with a bag of banjos.

07:08.173 --> 07:11.306
You can't hunt for shit,
you can't talk for shit,

07:11.308 --> 07:13.779
and you ain't got the looks
to pucker a pig's butt, boy.

07:14.246 --> 07:17.616
Yet here you are,
jackass-eatin' cactus.

07:19.917 --> 07:23.188
An imbecile of immoral repute.

07:28.392 --> 07:30.328
I'm sorry, Karl.

07:30.529 --> 07:31.796
Yeah, I know you are.

07:32.630 --> 07:34.696
Just like you sorry
'bout all them whores

07:34.698 --> 07:36.301
in this town or the other.

07:41.238 --> 07:43.676
Jesus, it's Foggy.

07:46.777 --> 07:48.544
- Foggy!
- Dale's over here.

07:48.546 --> 07:50.616
Hell, we ain't been
gone but half a day.

07:55.419 --> 07:56.354
Karl.

07:58.924 --> 08:00.756
They must've just left here.

08:00.758 --> 08:02.327
Got two eyes and a brain,
ain't I?

08:02.894 --> 08:04.893
What's that brain tellin' you?

08:04.895 --> 08:06.464
We got Blackfoot
to thank for this.

08:07.666 --> 08:10.265
And to the victor go the spoils.

08:12.503 --> 08:13.936
Goddamn heathens.

08:13.938 --> 08:15.138
That's why us scallywags
gotta stick together, Lonnie.

08:15.140 --> 08:18.575
See, you've got a penchant
for havin' your way with whores.

08:18.577 --> 08:21.747
And me, I like takin' things
that don't rightly belong to me.

08:22.214 --> 08:23.749
Isn't it odd they
didn't take no gold?

08:24.515 --> 08:26.652
What kinda Injuns
don't take no gold, Karl?

08:30.688 --> 08:31.756
- Karl?
- What is it?

08:33.592 --> 08:35.657
They left a bag of scalps.

08:39.462 --> 08:41.633
Blackfoot don't leave
no scalps in bags.

08:45.536 --> 08:46.571
What is it, Lonnie?

08:47.771 --> 08:49.207
You look like you seen a ghost.

08:50.775 --> 08:51.677
Jesus!

09:09.827 --> 09:12.463
Please, please don't kill me.

09:15.266 --> 09:17.734
"Associate yourself
with men of good quality

09:17.736 --> 09:19.737
if you esteem your reputation.

09:20.572 --> 09:25.411
For it is far better to be alone
than in bad company."

09:26.377 --> 09:29.311
And I do believe
George Washington said that

09:29.313 --> 09:31.346
and I do not think
he would've approved

09:31.348 --> 09:33.615
of what you done to that
whore back at 14 Mile.

09:33.617 --> 09:34.652
Have mercy.

09:35.853 --> 09:38.556
Mercy is somethin' you beg for
at the Pearly Gates, son.

09:40.659 --> 09:42.457
No!

09:42.459 --> 09:44.594
Just my job
to make sure you there on time.

09:44.596 --> 09:45.496
No!

11:16.520 --> 11:17.856
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

11:43.081 --> 11:44.946
By the time I read
these damn things,

11:44.948 --> 11:46.615
they're over a month old.

11:46.617 --> 11:48.753
I'm readin' about the past,
not the present.

11:49.754 --> 11:50.723
I still send for 'em.

11:53.491 --> 11:56.528
You know what they called me
in, uh, St Louis

11:56.895 --> 11:59.128
when I told 'em I
was gonna come out here

11:59.130 --> 12:01.531
and start a minin' operation

12:01.533 --> 12:04.403
in the midst all this
hostile Indian territory, and...

12:05.202 --> 12:08.503
bandits and road agents
roamin' around like elk

12:08.505 --> 12:11.740
and bears,
more monsters than animals.

12:11.742 --> 12:14.412
They said I...
I had a death wish.

12:17.481 --> 12:19.748
Suicidal was the exact term,
I believe.

12:19.750 --> 12:20.919
And now look at me.

12:22.086 --> 12:23.856
I got one of the largest
gold operations in the world.

12:25.155 --> 12:27.659
Risk, Mr. Ransom,
always take it.

12:28.025 --> 12:29.959
No matter what the cost may be.

12:29.961 --> 12:33.763
Never have been much of
a risk taker, Mr. Carrington.

12:33.765 --> 12:35.096
Oh, sure you have.

12:35.098 --> 12:36.666
Who else would come
in here drippin'

12:36.668 --> 12:39.701
man's biology all over
my saloon's floor?

12:39.703 --> 12:42.537
Anyone else I'd have 'em
cut with a straight razor

12:42.539 --> 12:45.077
till they was
unrecognizable to God himself.

12:45.643 --> 12:47.012
Men, sir.

12:47.946 --> 12:49.615
- Pardon?
- Men's biology.

12:50.114 --> 12:54.216
Plural, as in more than one.

12:54.218 --> 12:56.185
Yes, I know the meaning
of plural.

12:56.187 --> 12:57.619
What is your meaning with it?

12:57.621 --> 12:59.824
Four men's biology, to be exact.

13:00.124 --> 13:01.760
Don't drip on my desk, please.

13:03.895 --> 13:07.198
I found 'em out on a trail
runnin' away from town,

13:07.765 --> 13:11.068
like most thieves will do in
these kinds of situations.

13:11.702 --> 13:15.207
Well, I thought
you'd bring back one,

13:16.140 --> 13:18.476
maybe two,
but not without wound.

13:19.244 --> 13:20.678
Not wounded, are you?

13:22.246 --> 13:24.482
I reckon I gave
enough blood durin' the war.

13:26.717 --> 13:29.621
I do try to avoid lead
when and where I can, sir.

13:32.424 --> 13:33.455
More particularly, I'd rather
just snatch a man's life from him

13:33.457 --> 13:36.627
before his trigger finger
can get to itchin'.

13:37.629 --> 13:40.132
Makes things go
a whole lot easier.

13:40.564 --> 13:42.534
Bag looks a bit light for
there bein' heads in it.

13:43.233 --> 13:45.700
What's a head weigh,
eight pounds?

13:45.702 --> 13:47.573
I brung you their scalps, sir.

13:48.640 --> 13:50.808
And I reckon the correct weight
on a human head,

13:51.042 --> 13:54.813
brain included,
is roughly about ten pounds.

13:55.847 --> 13:59.114
And I do parlay that figure
on good authority.

13:59.116 --> 14:00.582
You're a head hunter, Hollis.

14:00.584 --> 14:03.187
You're supposed to
bring back the heads.

14:03.821 --> 14:06.755
See, that's how I'm supposed
to know you're an honest man

14:06.757 --> 14:10.926
and not killin' some poor
soul for a bit of silver.

14:10.928 --> 14:13.763
How else am I supposed to know
who it is you brought back?

14:13.765 --> 14:15.864
Them there scalps
belong to the three boys

14:15.866 --> 14:18.901
that done wrote your
gold haul, few days back.

14:18.903 --> 14:20.869
Fourth belongs to
a kid named Lonnie Bixby.

14:20.871 --> 14:23.205
He was ridin' with them
and he's the one responsible

14:23.207 --> 14:24.639
for the cuttin'
of Ma Whitman's girl

14:24.641 --> 14:26.911
'bout the same time
the gold haul got took.

14:27.978 --> 14:31.582
Now, in total that
is 500 dollars a piece

14:32.583 --> 14:36.154
for the three and 1,000
for the Bixby kid.

14:36.888 --> 14:38.753
Now he's worth
twice that back east

14:38.755 --> 14:40.858
but I will just settle out
on 1,000 for him.

14:42.293 --> 14:43.762
Now listen here.

14:45.329 --> 14:49.166
As far as me being
trustworthy and all...

14:56.808 --> 15:00.212
I do believe that
that should satisfy

15:01.044 --> 15:02.046
your questionability.

15:11.121 --> 15:15.123
Well, you never do disappoint
do you, Hollis?

15:15.125 --> 15:19.831
All right... all right I will
pay you for the three,

15:20.264 --> 15:23.132
but you better take up the kid
with Ma,

15:23.134 --> 15:26.936
seeing it was her...
property that was damaged.

15:26.938 --> 15:27.905
Here you go.

15:30.174 --> 15:31.773
Whoa! Hey,
what's this interruption here?

15:31.775 --> 15:33.375
I'm tryin' to conduct
some business.

15:33.377 --> 15:36.811
- Goddamn it.
- Pardon me, sir, Gentry here,

15:36.813 --> 15:38.279
thought he could
pocket from you.

15:38.281 --> 15:39.882
Oh no,

15:39.884 --> 15:41.219
shut the door.

15:46.691 --> 15:48.994
Everybody thinks they can
steal from me nowadays.

15:52.096 --> 15:53.796
Explain yourself.

15:53.798 --> 15:55.764
Gots no excuse, sir,
but please Mr. Carrington.

15:55.766 --> 15:56.931
I have a wife and child

15:56.933 --> 15:58.636
- and I have to care for them.
- Yeah.

15:58.903 --> 16:01.106
- Mr. Gentry, is it?
- Yes, sir.

16:02.240 --> 16:05.277
How do you think stealing
from me is a service to them?

16:06.678 --> 16:07.913
I suppose it isn't, sir.

16:09.746 --> 16:10.748
Mm-hmm.

16:13.150 --> 16:15.884
You think I'm a forgiving man?

16:15.886 --> 16:16.918
Yes, sir.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.454
Yes, sir,
generous and forgivin'.

16:18.456 --> 16:20.792
No man like you,
none in the whole gulch.

16:21.225 --> 16:22.728
Well, you're lucky.

16:23.193 --> 16:26.030
You see this tall drink of
water standin' over here?

16:26.396 --> 16:29.230
If my men hadn't
caught you in the act,

16:29.232 --> 16:31.700
I would be obliged to send
him out to collect you

16:31.702 --> 16:33.938
and I might have to pay him

16:34.237 --> 16:36.772
to make an example outta you

16:36.774 --> 16:38.909
and bring your head back
in a bag.

16:39.744 --> 16:42.147
Now how would that be
for your wife and child?

16:42.746 --> 16:44.814
They would be broke and homeless

16:44.816 --> 16:48.320
and your wife would probably
have to take up whorin'.

16:48.819 --> 16:50.789
You wouldn't want that,
would you, Mr. Gentry?

16:51.422 --> 16:52.424
Hm?

16:53.792 --> 16:56.962
Man after man runnin' themselves
through your poor innocent wife.

16:58.795 --> 17:00.398
Some of them even
like children, I hear.

17:03.167 --> 17:04.435
Which is your writin' hand?

17:05.303 --> 17:07.204
My right, sir.

17:07.938 --> 17:10.872
- Hold his left.
- No, no, no, no!

17:10.874 --> 17:12.810
Oh, Jesus!
Oh, Jesus, no!

17:13.143 --> 17:16.213
Jesus no!

17:18.782 --> 17:21.183
- Jesus!
- All right, all right.

17:21.185 --> 17:22.483
Put him back on the line.

17:22.486 --> 17:25.487
Man can still pan for gold
with one hand.

17:25.489 --> 17:28.156
Oh, and by the way, good man,

17:28.159 --> 17:30.294
you ever try stealin'
from me again,

17:30.495 --> 17:32.863
the consequences
will be unbearable.

17:35.365 --> 17:36.400
Ugh.

17:39.070 --> 17:40.172
Close the door!

17:42.172 --> 17:44.108
God damn, born in a barn.

17:46.043 --> 17:47.145
Yeah.

17:47.778 --> 17:49.844
Well, I do not know
whether the nature

17:49.846 --> 17:52.514
of these barbaric affairs
has distracted me,

17:52.516 --> 17:54.149
but I certainly
forgot my manners.

17:54.151 --> 17:56.388
Have a seat, Mr. Ransom.

17:59.823 --> 18:01.826
My curiosity runs rampant.

18:03.995 --> 18:08.366
Color me intrigued
as to why you would stray

18:08.565 --> 18:10.499
from your occupational title?

18:13.137 --> 18:16.338
My hands were cold
and my knife was dull.

18:16.340 --> 18:17.775
All right.

18:18.275 --> 18:19.177
Mm.

18:21.012 --> 18:24.015
Brutality calls for creativity
in times of duress.

18:24.448 --> 18:26.485
That is one way
you can put it, sir.

18:26.950 --> 18:30.387
Like I said, I was just
vulnerable to the elements.

18:30.987 --> 18:33.758
- Yeah, there it is.
- Job is a job, Mr. Carrington.

18:35.025 --> 18:37.195
I will keep sending
men to meet their maker

18:37.829 --> 18:39.231
if you keep the silver flowing.

18:40.031 --> 18:42.464
Although a golden eagle or two

18:42.466 --> 18:44.136
would not go
unnoticed by myself.

18:44.467 --> 18:46.237
You see,
therein lies the problem.

18:46.469 --> 18:48.937
You do the same job

18:48.939 --> 18:52.608
for my wonderfully
annoying competitors

18:52.610 --> 18:55.179
who rest just a stone's throw
out that door.

18:57.047 --> 19:01.318
See, I've... I've heard a lot
about you, Mr. Ransom.

19:02.053 --> 19:03.053
Many a tale.

19:07.158 --> 19:08.293
More than a man should

19:09.393 --> 19:11.496
for havin' known you for
such a short period of time.

19:16.132 --> 19:19.103
Stories about men in my trade
are abundant, Mr. Carrington.

19:20.871 --> 19:22.404
Don't go puttin' too
much stock in tales

19:22.406 --> 19:23.507
that get told around a fire.

19:26.142 --> 19:29.878
Well normally I wouldn't,
but, um, something tells me

19:29.880 --> 19:32.016
that most of what is told
about you is truth.

19:33.918 --> 19:37.389
Such as the story during the war

19:38.089 --> 19:42.390
when one brother fought
to defend freedom

19:42.392 --> 19:46.028
and the other, slavery,
and one brother felt

19:46.030 --> 19:49.631
so betrayed in absolute form

19:49.633 --> 19:52.269
that he killed
his brother's negro wife.

20:19.563 --> 20:20.899
We gotta get you outta here,
sir.

20:21.098 --> 20:24.101
Come on, sir. Come on.

20:28.605 --> 20:30.207
And then after the war,

20:30.675 --> 20:34.646
that widowed brother
hunted his sibling west,

20:35.446 --> 20:40.351
devoted to ferrying
his kin's soul to hell himself.

20:43.353 --> 20:44.355
How's that for a story?

20:46.457 --> 20:47.926
Story's a story, sir.

20:48.726 --> 20:51.362
And most of the time
the details get muddied.

20:51.696 --> 20:52.898
Like I said,

20:53.965 --> 20:55.967
don't go puttin' too much stock
on what you hear.

20:57.668 --> 21:01.005
How much would it cost me to have you and
your services all to myself, Mr. Ransom?

21:02.038 --> 21:03.407
You said it yourself, sir.

21:04.041 --> 21:05.974
Now this here town is
stretched out

21:05.976 --> 21:09.214
across 14 miles on the richest
river the West has ever seen.

21:10.380 --> 21:13.282
Now it just so happens that
you two greedy sons of bitches

21:13.284 --> 21:15.486
planted stakes at
the very same time.

21:15.719 --> 21:18.320
Now, with all this wealth

21:18.322 --> 21:20.091
comes men
that don't wanna earn it.

21:20.557 --> 21:23.425
No, they'd rather just take it.

21:23.427 --> 21:25.964
Now please,
tell me something I do not know.

21:27.531 --> 21:30.135
Well then, sir, like you,

21:31.502 --> 21:33.471
I am a businessman.

21:35.573 --> 21:39.009
My business is tracking down
the folks that do you wrong.

21:40.643 --> 21:42.413
The only difference
between me and you

21:43.113 --> 21:45.216
is that I deal in pound
for pound in flesh and blood.

21:45.548 --> 21:46.450
You?

21:47.752 --> 21:48.986
Silver and gold.

21:50.420 --> 21:54.025
Now I give them across that there
thoroughfare the very same service.

21:54.557 --> 21:58.496
For if I did not,
it would be bad business.

21:59.095 --> 22:00.664
Yes, well, I can respect that.

22:02.265 --> 22:03.034
Much obliged, sir.

22:04.034 --> 22:07.505
Do you wanna take one
of these singulars over

22:08.171 --> 22:09.975
so you can settle up with Ma?

22:11.508 --> 22:12.710
I reckon I do not.

22:15.345 --> 22:17.015
She trusts my word.

22:17.214 --> 22:20.081
- Eventually you will too.
- Yes, now, off you go.

22:20.083 --> 22:21.282
Sure we'll see each
other soon enough

22:21.284 --> 22:22.285
at my own expense.

22:23.120 --> 22:26.358
Give my regards to thy
lowly competitors will you?

22:34.198 --> 22:35.132
Hey!

22:36.434 --> 22:38.203
You got bad eyes, mister.

22:38.569 --> 22:40.005
Damn near almost
ran a lady over.

22:40.236 --> 22:41.406
Not sure I'd call you a lady

22:42.506 --> 22:43.440
with the way you're flappin'
your mouth like that.

22:44.441 --> 22:47.277
Sure looks to me like
you could use a bath.

22:48.446 --> 22:49.680
How's that for man eyes?

22:51.381 --> 22:53.551
Well my eyes tell me
you could use a doctor.

22:57.420 --> 22:58.590
Lady, my ass.

23:11.601 --> 23:17.342
Well, look what the cat
just drug in.

23:18.141 --> 23:22.176
Oh, no new holes in you
this time I see.

23:22.178 --> 23:24.812
Out of the fire,
into the frying pan, eh?

23:24.814 --> 23:26.551
It's the opposite
way as you said.

23:26.816 --> 23:29.553
It's frying pan into the fire.

23:29.753 --> 23:34.292
Jesus, Walter, where does
that brain of yours come from?

23:34.792 --> 23:36.327
China?

23:36.794 --> 23:37.892
Devil woman.

23:37.894 --> 23:39.129
Now listen here.

23:40.130 --> 23:42.100
Carrington's got a bag
of scalps over there.

23:42.432 --> 23:44.468
I got me that Bixby kid
while I was out.

23:45.803 --> 23:47.572
I do believe a thousand
was on him here.

23:47.771 --> 23:48.840
Whatcha say to that?

23:52.243 --> 23:54.446
That kid cost me a good penny.

23:56.412 --> 23:58.714
He cut up Betty so bad
they had to send her

23:58.716 --> 24:01.151
back to Kansas City.

24:02.319 --> 24:04.586
Poor girl'll be pushin'
a broom for the rest of her life

24:04.588 --> 24:08.126
and catchin' stink eye from
every swingin' dick in the room.

24:10.561 --> 24:13.531
Pay the man his money,
Walter, 1,000 even.

24:14.265 --> 24:17.666
And you take a free room
and a fuck for the night

24:17.668 --> 24:19.504
along with that payment, Hollis.

24:24.574 --> 24:25.709
Yup, you lay yourself down,

24:26.643 --> 24:31.849
put that head on a nice pillow
and rest those damn eyes.

24:32.682 --> 24:36.553
You're the only reliable man
in my life at the moment.

24:37.188 --> 24:38.553
What am I, chopped liver?

24:38.555 --> 24:39.890
No.

24:40.524 --> 24:42.760
You're a gold sniffin'
son of a bitch, Walter,

24:43.294 --> 24:44.428
and I love you for it.

24:46.362 --> 24:47.364
Here you are.

24:48.732 --> 24:49.701
How long you in town for?

24:51.534 --> 24:52.836
A few days I reckon.

24:54.205 --> 24:57.205
You ought to try out some of our
new sheets from San Francisco.

24:57.207 --> 24:58.442
Goddammit!

24:58.942 --> 25:00.577
Looks like ol' Bill
is at it again.

25:05.416 --> 25:06.948
Gimme a bottle
of the good stuff, Ma.

25:06.950 --> 25:09.417
You're takin' money
off of fools, Bill?

25:09.419 --> 25:12.422
Ain't my fault. None...
That them are no good cards.

25:21.765 --> 25:23.301
Can I help you with something?

25:25.602 --> 25:27.205
He's good people, Bill.

25:27.638 --> 25:28.736
Don't you worry none.

25:28.738 --> 25:30.240
I know exactly what he is,

25:31.542 --> 25:33.444
and I'm none too fond
of his kind.

25:39.550 --> 25:42.553
We want our money back,
you dirty old cheat.

25:43.687 --> 25:44.889
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah.

25:46.390 --> 25:48.258
They all callin' me cheats too?

25:50.361 --> 25:52.496
No, no, they're my words.

25:53.630 --> 25:56.398
Everyone here knows no one can
win much as you do in here.

25:56.400 --> 25:59.303
Boys, I don't want no troubles
in here tonight.

26:01.604 --> 26:05.509
Listen son,
I'm sorry for your loss.

26:06.476 --> 26:09.846
But if you can't hack the game,
don't play.

26:14.051 --> 26:17.554
Well, I'm obliged.

26:21.859 --> 26:24.662
I'll be havin' my money back...
now!

26:25.862 --> 26:26.930
No you won't.

26:28.698 --> 26:30.334
Listen here, you ol' cuss.

26:47.383 --> 26:49.653
Don't be expectin'
no thank you from me.

26:50.787 --> 26:52.522
Ma, Walter.

26:52.755 --> 26:53.925
See ya tomorrow, Bill.

27:45.976 --> 27:47.011
Excuse me, sir.

27:51.547 --> 27:53.517
Ma said you might be wantin'
some company tonight.

27:58.822 --> 28:00.425
You maybe wantin' a tussle?

28:00.990 --> 28:02.025
It's been slow,
I ain't sore yet.

28:04.961 --> 28:06.963
I'm clean, mister, I promise.

28:25.716 --> 28:26.851
You know any songs?

28:27.985 --> 28:29.053
Sure, I know a few.

28:33.791 --> 28:34.792
Sing me somethin'.

28:36.659 --> 28:39.964
Something that rivals
your prettiness.

28:52.642 --> 28:53.577
Go on now.

29:03.187 --> 29:06.154
♪ He's gone away ♪

29:06.156 --> 29:10.995
♪ For to stay a little while ♪

29:11.961 --> 29:15.165
♪ But he's comin' back ♪

29:15.565 --> 29:20.438
♪ If he goes 10,000 miles ♪

29:21.170 --> 29:25.874
♪ Oh, who will tie my shoes? ♪

29:27.143 --> 29:32.516

29:33.583 --> 29:39.189

my ruby lips? ♪

29:39.857 --> 29:42.760

29:43.226 --> 29:45.796
♪ Gone away ♪

29:45.996 --> 29:49.167

30:08.685 --> 30:11.889
"To where do you rats scurry?"
asks the cat.

30:15.292 --> 30:16.994
Now we don't want any trouble.

30:17.660 --> 30:19.727
Best you be movin' on, mister.

30:23.633 --> 30:25.766
Trouble was thrust upon you

30:25.768 --> 30:27.737
the moment you
were born, nigger.

31:12.682 --> 31:14.684
That sumbitch done shot me,
Cap'n.

31:21.792 --> 31:23.727
I'd expect the same
outta any of you

31:24.127 --> 31:26.130
if that was me layin' there
with lead in my belly.

31:32.268 --> 31:33.770
We got gold here, Cap'n.

31:35.005 --> 31:38.609
I told you if you came west
with me, you'd all be rich men.

31:39.976 --> 31:43.246
And since your God-given right
to hold slaves was taken away,

31:43.780 --> 31:46.584
I promised you'd get to kill
all that you could weather.

31:47.249 --> 31:49.152
And I have not faltered
on that promise.

31:51.021 --> 31:52.290
We headin' south, Cap'n?

31:52.922 --> 31:55.756
East over the Bear Tooth
and into Big Sky.

31:55.758 --> 31:57.260
We'll hole up there
for a breath.

32:30.226 --> 32:32.996
Looks like one of Carrington's
outfits been attacked by bandits.

32:45.007 --> 32:45.875
Where you goin', mister?

32:46.442 --> 32:48.211
Got work to attend to now.

32:48.711 --> 32:50.046
If you ever wanna come
back again, please do.

32:51.014 --> 32:53.851
There ain't many men like ya,
nice an' all.

33:28.985 --> 33:31.285
Whole shift of panners
slaughtered in the night

33:31.287 --> 33:32.689
and a day's load of gold stolen.

33:33.189 --> 33:36.190
- I told 'em who you was, sir.
- What'd they say?

33:36.192 --> 33:38.294
They didn't care none;
they just shot us up.

33:38.794 --> 33:40.728
Just like they did
back in Kansas City.

33:40.730 --> 33:41.798
What'd he look like?

33:43.332 --> 33:45.800
Tell me, what did he look like?

33:45.802 --> 33:47.068
He was Confederate, mister.

33:47.070 --> 33:49.471
- How many?
- About a baker's dozen.

33:49.473 --> 33:51.108
They said they were
headin' up to Big Sky.

33:53.110 --> 33:54.475
Get this man a doctor.

33:54.477 --> 33:56.380
No wait, wait, wait.
I'm still talkin' to him here.

33:57.147 --> 33:59.246
I can tell ya everythin'
you need to know

33:59.248 --> 34:02.149
about the man and his posse
that done killed your boys.

34:02.151 --> 34:03.254
So the stories are true.

34:04.521 --> 34:06.286
The man outside's got a mark,

34:06.288 --> 34:09.224
a mark that one Everett Ransom
would brand on his boys

34:09.226 --> 34:10.995
that served under his
regiment during the war.

34:12.293 --> 34:15.931
If I'm not mistaken, you rode
a desk during that time.

34:16.166 --> 34:18.902
So I'm goin' to assume you
have heard of my dear brother.

34:19.135 --> 34:20.371
Yes I have.

34:21.572 --> 34:23.905
The acts that he has been
accused of or have committed,

34:23.907 --> 34:26.476
I thought only a monster
was capable of such things.

34:27.811 --> 34:29.213
That feeling is mutual, sir.

34:33.181 --> 34:37.021
Five thousand. I'll give you
5,000 dollars to kill 'em all.

34:40.054 --> 34:42.425
I reckon that they gained
some distance on me by now.

34:44.226 --> 34:47.031
If I'm gon' catch 'em
and bring you their heads,

34:48.532 --> 34:50.367
I'mma need someone
that knows that terrain.

34:52.001 --> 34:54.467
All right, you go to the end of the
thoroughfare, make a left, end of the street.

34:54.469 --> 34:56.072
It's the best tracker in town.

35:03.512 --> 35:06.483
And the ground will be stained
with the blood of heathens.

35:08.450 --> 35:10.787
Lord have mercy on their souls.

35:27.970 --> 35:28.838
Well then.

35:31.340 --> 35:33.977
Come to apologize for
the rudeness, have you?

35:34.211 --> 35:36.514
No, I'm here
lookin' for a tracker

35:37.280 --> 35:39.917
and you surely cannot be him.

35:41.383 --> 35:42.786
And what if I am?

35:43.485 --> 35:44.420
Rose.

35:48.858 --> 35:50.293
Get back to making that stew.

35:57.334 --> 36:00.437
There is only one reason headhunter
comes knockin' on my door.

36:02.372 --> 36:03.374
May I come in?

36:04.608 --> 36:06.811
Only 'cause
you're quick with a knife.

36:07.142 --> 36:10.814
And these bones are old and cold
with this here door open.

36:29.131 --> 36:31.267
Next time you decide
to help a stranger,

36:32.903 --> 36:35.305
stab the guy in his
drawin' hand, will you?

36:36.139 --> 36:38.372
That little bastard is gonna
be lookin' to pull on me

36:38.374 --> 36:40.276
every time I turn my back
on him in town.

36:45.215 --> 36:46.082
Get your business done.

36:46.916 --> 36:48.682
I need to hire
someone to take me up

36:48.684 --> 36:50.453
and over the Bear Tooth
up into Big Sky.

36:51.553 --> 36:54.390
It could be day, week...

36:55.392 --> 36:57.328
I cannot promise
a day of return.

36:58.561 --> 37:00.264
I can see it in your eyes.

37:02.231 --> 37:03.534
What might that be?

37:04.367 --> 37:07.238
Huntin' a man is not the same
as huntin' an animal

37:08.271 --> 37:12.109
and you have no intention
of returnin' from said hunt.

37:13.376 --> 37:16.311
If you were goin' after
a mountain lion or a buffalo,

37:16.313 --> 37:18.515
or shit, even a grizzly,
I would take you.

37:20.617 --> 37:24.255
But as I said last night,
I'm just not fond of your kind.

37:26.021 --> 37:29.125
It just don't seem... honorable.

37:31.561 --> 37:32.896
But you see, I...

37:33.128 --> 37:35.164
I have a daughter here
to care for

37:36.499 --> 37:41.169
and, uh, it's one thing for me
to get mauled by a buffalo

37:41.171 --> 37:44.108
up there in the snow.

37:47.142 --> 37:51.379
But to get shot helpin'
a headhunter earn a few coins

37:51.381 --> 37:54.018
up in them there mountains,
leaving her on her lonesome.

37:55.684 --> 37:57.621
Well that I just
could not abide.

38:00.657 --> 38:03.327
My good wife would
drag me to Hades

38:04.526 --> 38:06.262
if I was to do
a thing like that.

38:10.166 --> 38:14.271
So, I will not be
the man to take you, sir.

38:15.238 --> 38:17.137
I haven't even told you
what the pay is yet.

38:17.139 --> 38:18.439
Doesn't make any difference.

38:18.441 --> 38:20.377
No amount of money
is gonna get me to take you.

38:21.443 --> 38:22.612
Not even 1,000 dollars?

38:24.113 --> 38:26.382
I will not be the man
to take you, mister.

38:31.387 --> 38:33.222
Understood.

38:35.090 --> 38:36.426
I thank you for your time.

39:01.450 --> 39:03.553
You could have tried to
be a bit more convincin'.

39:04.253 --> 39:06.089
Your pa had his mind made up.

39:07.157 --> 39:07.758
Still...

39:08.825 --> 39:10.294
you coulda tried harder.

39:11.327 --> 39:12.662
It would've been
a waste of breath.

39:14.597 --> 39:15.762
So you're still goin' then?

39:15.764 --> 39:17.433
As I said, I got a job to do.

39:18.468 --> 39:20.068
Just gotta make do is all.

39:20.070 --> 39:22.072
You ain't gonna last
but three days out there.

39:22.405 --> 39:25.275
You're either gonna get shot
to hell or turn up wolf bait.

39:28.778 --> 39:30.247
A thousand dollars, right?

39:32.548 --> 39:34.017
That is what I told him.

39:37.352 --> 39:38.555
I'll take you then.

39:41.624 --> 39:44.361
Now what in Sam Hell makes you
think that I would hire you?

39:47.597 --> 39:48.262
I've been goin' up that pass
and into them there mountains

39:48.264 --> 39:50.200
since I was six years young.

39:51.166 --> 39:53.233
Tracked and shot my first
grizzly when I was 10

39:53.235 --> 39:55.204
and packed it outta there
all by my lonesome.

39:55.872 --> 39:58.238
Ain't got anyone else
crazy enough to take you

39:58.240 --> 40:00.209
seein' as how you got
a death wish an' all.

40:01.343 --> 40:02.412
No sir,

40:03.546 --> 40:05.115
I'm the only bet you got

40:06.682 --> 40:09.552
and you'd be dumb as a turkey
not to take me up on it.

40:14.657 --> 40:15.856
Can you shoot?

40:15.858 --> 40:18.761
Does a dog bark?

40:19.829 --> 40:21.798
Can hit a rabbit
runnin' at 50 yards.

40:26.668 --> 40:27.670
Okay,

40:28.905 --> 40:31.408
I'll give ya 500 dollars.

40:34.644 --> 40:35.846
On account that I'm a woman?

40:39.550 --> 40:41.584
My worth
ain't the same as a man?

40:42.485 --> 40:43.586
No sir!

40:44.486 --> 40:46.153
A thousand as you say

40:46.155 --> 40:48.291
or off you go to be ripped apart
by the wolves.

40:57.733 --> 40:58.601
Hey!

41:04.206 --> 41:05.409
Well all right then.

41:06.910 --> 41:09.809
But where we're goin'
we can't take no horses,

41:09.811 --> 41:12.715
so you might wanna
unpack all that.

42:27.389 --> 42:29.759
They were on foot
through here, but...

42:30.459 --> 42:32.628
maybe they had horses
waitin' down there somewhere?

42:32.996 --> 42:34.294
Wouldn't have gone
on foot too long

42:34.296 --> 42:35.532
bein' so many men and all.

42:36.331 --> 42:37.233
Hmm.

42:37.599 --> 42:38.534
I reckon not.

42:39.369 --> 42:41.204
Ain't like my brother
to use horses.

42:41.903 --> 42:43.637
They was infantry in the war.

42:43.639 --> 42:44.740
Move fast as lightnin'.

42:45.642 --> 42:48.278
Besides, horses are loud.

42:48.910 --> 42:49.880
Your brother.

42:51.414 --> 42:54.251
That makes things
interesting then don't it?

42:54.617 --> 42:58.522
God, y'all must have glorious
Thanksgivings and Christmases.

42:59.021 --> 43:01.324
What the hell did y'all give
each other for presents anyway?

43:02.592 --> 43:03.693
A new scar each year?

43:04.927 --> 43:08.998
Anyhow, horses or not, I bet
they ain't got no snow shoes.

43:09.532 --> 43:10.997
They ain't got no snow shoes,

43:10.999 --> 43:12.566
they're gonna be
slow as molasses

43:12.568 --> 43:13.803
in some of the areas
we'll be crossin'.

43:14.736 --> 43:16.472
- That so?
- Yes, sir.

43:16.972 --> 43:18.439
In fact, in might be faster

43:18.441 --> 43:19.943
for us to go up
and over this way.

43:21.977 --> 43:24.981
Right and we are only two.

43:25.548 --> 43:26.717
They're a dozen.

43:27.450 --> 43:30.621
They gon' need to stop,
hunt, cook.

43:31.653 --> 43:35.258
I'm guessin' we're gainin'
half a day on 'em.

43:36.459 --> 43:39.263
Especially with them, uh,
what did you call 'em?

43:40.028 --> 43:41.264
Snow shoes.

43:41.631 --> 43:42.599
Right,

43:43.566 --> 43:44.668
them things.

44:38.019 --> 44:39.088
Hey, you see that?

44:40.622 --> 44:42.693
That's gonna be
falling down on us soon.

44:43.793 --> 44:45.559
Lucky we caught their trail
in the woods,

44:45.561 --> 44:46.829
worked our way through it.

44:47.497 --> 44:49.497
If the snow had fell
while we're in the pines,

44:49.499 --> 44:51.068
we'd be havin' a tough
time trackin' 'em.

44:52.769 --> 44:55.169
I got a good idea about which
route they'll be taking though.

44:55.171 --> 44:56.673
I suppose we'll fill
up while we're here.

44:56.872 --> 44:57.840
Yes, sir.

44:59.108 --> 45:00.843
We might as well just make camp.

45:02.611 --> 45:03.380
Here?

45:04.046 --> 45:05.082
In the open?

45:06.115 --> 45:07.818
Well, yeah.

45:08.818 --> 45:10.921
Sun's going down. You wanna be
wandering around in the dark?

45:13.722 --> 45:15.092
You afraid of something?

45:16.492 --> 45:17.994
Ain't me who's afraid.

45:18.927 --> 45:20.996
Well I'll let you in
on a little something.

45:21.664 --> 45:23.164
No bandits be
operating around here

45:23.166 --> 45:24.834
for another 20 miles or so.

45:25.501 --> 45:27.003
Unless they ain't right
in the head.

45:27.537 --> 45:29.840
Really, and why would that be?

45:30.572 --> 45:31.874
'Cause any one with half a brain

45:33.343 --> 45:34.911
knows not to go and disrupt Jonathan
Carrington's business endeavors,

45:37.512 --> 45:39.512
which means one of two things.

45:39.514 --> 45:41.751
Either your brother
is dumber than an ox

45:42.751 --> 45:44.954
or he's got balls bigger
than an eagle's eggs.

46:15.485 --> 46:16.553
G'night, sir.

46:17.253 --> 46:18.421
Goodnight.

46:24.494 --> 46:26.463
Why were you so
eager to be my guide?

46:28.564 --> 46:32.202
I mean, usually a
woman meets a man

46:33.001 --> 46:36.105
and she cooks him dinner,
washes his clothes.

46:37.006 --> 46:39.142
Shoot, bares his children.

46:39.675 --> 46:40.744
You?

46:41.142 --> 46:42.742
You couldn't get
wait to get out here

46:42.744 --> 46:44.747
and be anythin' but ladylike.

46:46.948 --> 46:49.852
Am I required to dignify
that question with a reply?

46:51.220 --> 46:53.657
Is that what a lady
is supposed to do?

46:53.956 --> 46:57.693
Will that finally qualify me
to be "ladylike"?

46:58.293 --> 47:01.130
A regular
firecracker you are.

47:01.597 --> 47:03.967
Attitude from here
to San Francisco.

47:04.733 --> 47:07.837
You got a funny habit of
reiteratin' everything you say.

47:09.137 --> 47:11.040
- Pardon?
- Reiteratin'.

47:12.173 --> 47:13.142
Repeatin'.

47:14.910 --> 47:18.745
As a man thing, y'all are born
with limited brain capacity,

47:18.747 --> 47:20.981
so I don't actually
expect you to understand

47:20.983 --> 47:22.552
all that much of what I say.

47:23.818 --> 47:25.852
Well, you know what?

47:25.854 --> 47:28.090
You... you women are born
with nothin' but...

47:28.323 --> 47:31.791
breasts and attitude.

47:31.793 --> 47:34.797
There ya go,
statin' the obvious once again.

47:36.566 --> 47:38.834
Where does all that sass
manifest from anyhow?

47:39.869 --> 47:40.769
"Manifest"?

47:41.736 --> 47:42.706
Big word.

47:44.206 --> 47:45.876
Where ya hidin' the dictionary?

47:47.276 --> 47:49.579
Now you really do take me for a
dimly lit lantern, now don't ya?

47:52.715 --> 47:54.250
I'm not even sure I'd say
the lantern's lit.

47:57.052 --> 47:59.522
Now back to
my original question.

48:00.990 --> 48:01.957
Why are you out here?

48:05.193 --> 48:07.264
I woulda thought that be obvious
even to you.

48:12.068 --> 48:14.571
I'm set on leavin' 14 Mile, sir.

48:15.905 --> 48:17.941
That ain't the place
for me no more.

48:22.043 --> 48:24.013
So, just where you dreamin'
of headin'?

48:25.046 --> 48:26.282
It ain't no dream.

48:27.517 --> 48:31.788
I got 919 dollars to go before I
can finally leave for good.

48:33.356 --> 48:35.725
This here job
gives me what I need...

48:38.927 --> 48:41.063
and Chicago's where
that money'll take me.

48:41.963 --> 48:43.967
- Chicago.
- Mm-hmm.

48:45.066 --> 48:47.970
Huh. I never woulda figured.

48:52.240 --> 48:55.744
I wanna walk underneath the tall
buildin's I hear they be erectin'.

48:57.813 --> 48:58.615
I wanna...

49:01.182 --> 49:06.289
stare across the great lake
and see a sunset just beyond it.

49:09.892 --> 49:13.292
I wanna shop on that street
they call Michigan Avenue

49:13.294 --> 49:14.664
for a fine dress.

49:14.863 --> 49:17.131
Then that same night,
wear that dress

49:17.133 --> 49:20.704
to one of the fine eateries
that serves Italian food.

49:25.206 --> 49:27.710
Hell, I even heard they've got
a beautiful bronze war memorial.

49:28.778 --> 49:31.113
That'd be somethin'
fancy to look at.

49:37.086 --> 49:38.053
You fought in the war?

49:41.823 --> 49:42.457
I did.

49:46.327 --> 49:48.230
Did you do bad things, sir?

49:53.836 --> 49:55.772
That's a real pretty
vision you got there, Rose.

49:56.706 --> 49:58.240
I hope you get to see
every bit of it.

50:00.709 --> 50:02.278
Well that's some more
of that deflection.

50:03.979 --> 50:05.715
What are you hidin'?

50:07.082 --> 50:08.351
I ain't hidin' nothin'.

50:11.153 --> 50:12.355
I can see it, you know?

50:13.021 --> 50:14.724
Just what do you think
you can see?

50:18.994 --> 50:20.095
All that hate.

50:35.043 --> 50:36.679
Well, well...

50:37.512 --> 50:39.715
if it ain't my little brother.

50:41.383 --> 50:42.952
What a pity he's got the scent.

50:44.186 --> 50:46.189
He'll be comin' for us
with a vengeance, Tommy.

50:49.425 --> 50:50.760
Ain't nothin'
we can't handle.

50:51.093 --> 50:52.526
Dirty union cocksucker.

50:52.528 --> 50:54.030
Don't you underestimate him.

50:54.896 --> 50:57.467
He will up and steal your shadow
if given the chance.

50:59.001 --> 51:01.037
We'll deal with him
when the time is right.

51:01.803 --> 51:03.006
Let's keep movin'
through the night.

51:04.139 --> 51:05.441
Snow will cover our tracks
and buy us some distance.

51:06.443 --> 51:08.311
Ain't no worries,
Cap'n, I'll tell the boys.

51:37.840 --> 51:39.309
This was
the Garner family's wagon.

51:41.177 --> 51:42.445
This happened last night.

51:45.447 --> 51:46.849
This wasn't Everett.

51:48.217 --> 51:49.184
No.

51:51.986 --> 51:54.189
Looks like it was
a Blackfoot war party.

51:56.258 --> 51:58.895
Tellin' me we gotta worry
about Indians out here now?

52:02.965 --> 52:05.267
Whites on horseback
draw the Blackfoot's attention.

52:05.934 --> 52:07.267
See, they want the horses.

52:07.269 --> 52:08.271
No horses, less attention.

52:10.939 --> 52:13.142
Could be a Blackfoot party
passes you right on by,

52:14.443 --> 52:16.012
got nothin' of value.

52:47.977 --> 52:48.511
Damn.

52:53.249 --> 52:54.350
What'd you find?

52:56.952 --> 52:58.321
You stay on over there now.

52:59.988 --> 53:01.622
Do not tell me
where I can stand.

53:01.624 --> 53:02.959
If I want to...

53:09.264 --> 53:10.499
That's Median Garner.

53:11.099 --> 53:12.901
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

53:32.387 --> 53:33.389
Dear Lord,

53:36.525 --> 53:38.091
please watch over
this little one

53:38.093 --> 53:41.865
as she makes her way
home now up to you.

53:44.999 --> 53:47.066
Let her be with her mother
and her father.

53:48.137 --> 53:49.535
Make them find the happiness

53:49.537 --> 53:51.240
they could not find
here on Earth.

53:52.240 --> 53:53.309
Thank you...

53:54.809 --> 53:57.947
for stealin' them away from the
violence that plagues our surroundings.

54:03.418 --> 54:05.320
In your name, Lord, we pray.

54:07.689 --> 54:08.992
You finished now?

54:14.195 --> 54:16.431
You're a mighty insensitive ass,
you know that?

54:50.631 --> 54:52.068
We got company.

54:58.606 --> 55:00.509
I know you got
that smarts and sass,

55:01.410 --> 55:03.479
but you are entering
my territory now.

55:04.412 --> 55:05.648
Stay behind me.

55:06.581 --> 55:08.016
Keep your trap shut. Understood?

55:13.354 --> 55:14.557
What y'all want?

55:16.657 --> 55:19.127
We was, uh,
just settin' up camp

55:19.762 --> 55:21.130
down past this creek.

55:23.365 --> 55:24.400
Seen the fire,

55:25.633 --> 55:27.369
just tryna be friendly is all.

55:29.271 --> 55:33.343
Well shit, we always love
company out here on the trail.

55:35.244 --> 55:37.280
Come on, get you by the fire.

55:37.579 --> 55:38.648
Get you warm.

55:39.782 --> 55:41.617
Leave whatever troubles
you've been carryin' behind ya.

55:42.284 --> 55:43.285
Come on now.

55:58.499 --> 55:59.635
Come on in now.

56:00.535 --> 56:01.570
Have a seat.

56:02.336 --> 56:03.539
Set you down.

56:04.706 --> 56:06.273
Get warm.

56:26.461 --> 56:28.264
How y'all like this
weather we're havin'?

56:29.131 --> 56:31.034
What'd y'all say
you were doin' out here?

56:32.401 --> 56:34.103
I'm just escortin'
the little lady here

56:34.302 --> 56:37.305
up over the Bear Tooth,
visit her father.

56:38.807 --> 56:40.309
Couldn't wait 'til Spring?

56:41.575 --> 56:44.046
Mighty nasty this time of year
with the Injuns all up in arms.

56:46.849 --> 56:48.651
Girl wanted to be
there for Christmas.

56:50.586 --> 56:52.455
She is a stubborn one, she is.

56:55.557 --> 56:56.659
'Bout you fellas?

56:57.660 --> 56:59.595
What business ya have
out here in the cold?

57:00.162 --> 57:01.564
We're just lookin'
for some folks is all.

57:02.430 --> 57:04.199
Figured they might
be around here.

57:05.666 --> 57:07.469
- Got lost, did they?
- Yeah.

57:09.171 --> 57:10.273
You could say that.

57:12.307 --> 57:13.676
You serve?

57:16.477 --> 57:20.347
Oh Jesus, boys, now... let's
not bring politics into this.

57:20.349 --> 57:23.182
Don't make for
civil conversation now, does it?

57:23.184 --> 57:25.854
Always ends in a goddamn
shootout in my experience.

57:26.287 --> 57:30.827
It's okay, I do believe
we are of the civil sort here.

57:31.760 --> 57:32.794
Right?

57:36.932 --> 57:41.838
Flown the color blue;
Union. And proud to be.

57:42.671 --> 57:45.441
Hmm. Fought for all them goddamn
niggers' rights then, huh?

57:46.675 --> 57:48.510
Nasty sort of business that was.

57:49.544 --> 57:51.747
What brought ya out here
to buffalo country?

57:52.213 --> 57:53.815
Same as everyone
else, I suppose.

57:54.883 --> 57:56.552
Went from flyin' the color blue,

57:57.718 --> 57:59.255
seekin' out the color gold.

58:00.488 --> 58:02.791
Wish I had the sack to jump
out here when it first hit.

58:03.224 --> 58:05.327
I got stuck
back in Yorktown, I did.

58:05.626 --> 58:07.496
Met these two out there, though.

58:08.564 --> 58:09.665
What 'bout y'all?

58:11.432 --> 58:12.300
War boys?

58:13.501 --> 58:16.371
Confederates tried to get
their hooks in Yoke over there.

58:16.572 --> 58:19.441
Run a Lieutenant through though,
so that didn't last long.

58:19.941 --> 58:22.344
Managed to avoid
the noose, he did.

58:22.811 --> 58:24.713
Still tryna figure that one out.

58:25.347 --> 58:28.215
We all started runnin' around
together durin' the war.

58:28.217 --> 58:29.852
Makin' kind of a business
out of it.

58:31.220 --> 58:32.355
What do you mean?

58:34.289 --> 58:35.525
Well...

58:36.825 --> 58:39.594
Union and Confederate upper
management needed things done.

58:39.961 --> 58:42.497
Things of a... a violent nature,

58:43.331 --> 58:45.200
so we helped out when we could.

58:46.300 --> 58:49.336
Union officer needed
a town ransacked,

58:49.338 --> 58:51.240
but couldn't have his soldiers
be the ones did it.

58:51.472 --> 58:52.608
We did it for him.

58:52.907 --> 58:54.409
Same with the Confederates.

58:54.809 --> 58:57.746
Business is business in wartime,
you know what I mean?

58:58.546 --> 59:00.914
I remember this one time,
we just got down

59:00.916 --> 59:03.218
in this small town
in South Carolina.

59:03.818 --> 59:06.755
Residents were holin' up
supplies for the graybacks.

59:07.488 --> 59:09.722
Union officer
wanted us to go in,

59:09.724 --> 59:10.525
shake 'em up a bit,

59:10.925 --> 59:13.395
make 'em know
not to do it no more.

59:14.496 --> 59:16.432
They were hidin'
guns in hay bales,

59:16.664 --> 59:20.235
buryin' ammo,
storin' food in barns.

59:20.635 --> 59:22.669
No one of consequence
in the whole town.

59:22.671 --> 59:24.807
Women, children, old folks.

59:26.608 --> 59:29.879
This woman come up to me,
pretty little thing.

59:30.746 --> 59:32.914
She had a baby in her arms.

59:34.015 --> 59:35.851
Baby just wouldn't stop cryin'.

59:36.785 --> 59:38.721
Kept yellin' and hollerin'.

59:39.954 --> 59:42.724
Maybe it wanted food,
hell if I know.

59:43.624 --> 59:47.295
Anyways,
woman just kept starin' at me

59:48.396 --> 59:49.831
lookin' deep like she was...

59:50.599 --> 59:52.901
starin' into my soul
or somethin'.

59:54.769 --> 59:56.605
Made me awful uncomfortable.

59:57.673 --> 01:00:00.807
I couldn't tell if she wanted us
to take her and the baby away,

01:00:00.809 --> 01:00:02.445
or if she wanted us to leave.

01:00:03.744 --> 01:00:06.348
My mind just couldn't
make no sense of it.

01:00:06.881 --> 01:00:07.983
Couldn't wrap my head around it.

01:00:10.485 --> 01:00:14.724
Well, a few days earlier,
I found this real neat pike

01:00:14.923 --> 01:00:16.691
lyin' among a pile of bodies.

01:00:17.626 --> 01:00:20.863
I pulled it out
and it got me real curious.

01:00:22.331 --> 01:00:24.367
See,
someone had made it all special.

01:00:25.099 --> 01:00:27.902
Instead of one blade
like a normal bayonet,

01:00:28.803 --> 01:00:30.405
this one had two.

01:00:32.073 --> 01:00:33.842
Just seemed like
the right thing to do.

01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:39.682
Pulled it outta my belt,
ran it forward,

01:00:40.115 --> 01:00:42.418
pushed it through the little one

01:00:42.784 --> 01:00:44.352
and right on into its mama.

01:00:47.055 --> 01:00:50.626
Damn pike was the best thing
I ever found during the war.

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:54.896
Does funny things to a man,
war and such.

01:00:57.432 --> 01:00:58.700
How 'bout you, Yankee?

01:00:59.601 --> 01:01:01.736
Got any good memories
from your service?

01:01:04.005 --> 01:01:05.740
I reckon I got a few memories.

01:01:06.907 --> 01:01:08.476
Wouldn't call 'em good though.

01:01:13.782 --> 01:01:14.883
What do ya think?

01:01:16.852 --> 01:01:19.088
Ain't this the finest thing
you ever did see?

01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:24.526
It's still got the blood stains
on it and all.

01:01:27.863 --> 01:01:31.701
Hey Yankee, I'm talkin' to you.

01:01:33.635 --> 01:01:34.503
What's the matter?

01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:38.607
Cold shiver
runnin' down your spine, sir?

01:01:39.173 --> 01:01:40.573
Fig will you look at this?

01:01:40.575 --> 01:01:44.546
I got that old Yankee soldier pissin' his britches.

01:01:49.985 --> 01:01:52.387
Son of a bitch!

01:01:53.188 --> 01:01:55.988
What you did back there
to that little girl

01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:57.126
and her family,

01:01:57.793 --> 01:02:00.095
ain't no room
on God's green earth

01:02:00.796 --> 01:02:01.894
for the likes of you.

01:02:01.896 --> 01:02:03.398
No, no, please...
Please, mister.

01:02:03.597 --> 01:02:06.434
You done already taken
my manhood, let me keep my life.

01:02:06.834 --> 01:02:09.438
Please mister, we was just
tryin' to make a livin'...

01:02:22.550 --> 01:02:24.052
You ever kill anyone before?

01:02:25.986 --> 01:02:27.088
No.

01:02:29.523 --> 01:02:32.861
Well, first time for everything
I suppose.

01:03:29.818 --> 01:03:31.787
This is the way they come.
I just...

01:03:32.521 --> 01:03:33.923
I can't find the trail.

01:03:34.289 --> 01:03:35.991
How do you know
they come that way then?

01:03:36.590 --> 01:03:38.092
'Cause it's what I do.

01:03:41.061 --> 01:03:42.130
Well there's the problem.

01:03:43.697 --> 01:03:44.696
What problem?

01:03:44.698 --> 01:03:46.769
My brother don't think like you
is the problem.

01:03:55.744 --> 01:03:56.544
Shit.

01:04:07.988 --> 01:04:12.695
You wanna talk about it?

01:04:13.861 --> 01:04:14.729
Talk about what?

01:04:15.863 --> 01:04:16.764
Killin' a man.

01:04:18.967 --> 01:04:20.102
It ain't no easy thing.

01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:24.005
I'm fine.

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.642
Sure you are.

01:04:29.244 --> 01:04:31.311
You just ain't no killer is all.

01:04:31.313 --> 01:04:32.745
I killed a man last night,
didn't I?

01:04:32.747 --> 01:04:34.650
Now that... That is a fact.

01:04:36.251 --> 01:04:37.186
But that...

01:04:38.186 --> 01:04:40.722
was a seat-of-your-pants moment.

01:04:41.622 --> 01:04:44.856
Now, you let your emotions
take over

01:04:44.858 --> 01:04:47.195
when you heard the story about
that woman and her child.

01:04:50.331 --> 01:04:54.269
Another situation arises
where you can kill

01:04:55.604 --> 01:04:59.308
with no emotions involved,
I bet every time...

01:05:01.142 --> 01:05:02.778
you do not pull that trigger.

01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:06.916
You see...

01:05:12.052 --> 01:05:14.689
you, you got a conscience.

01:05:19.693 --> 01:05:21.130
Ain't no killer in you, girl.

01:05:28.836 --> 01:05:30.672
And that ain't such a bad thing.

01:05:43.117 --> 01:05:44.786
Trail. Trail!

01:05:45.986 --> 01:05:49.157
I told ya
they woulda come this way.

01:05:51.825 --> 01:05:53.329
Well,
what the hell ya waitin' for?

01:05:53.794 --> 01:05:56.028
Your brother and that money
ain't gettin' any closer

01:05:56.030 --> 01:05:58.099
to either one of us
just standin' around here.

01:06:07.943 --> 01:06:10.646
Lord, I don't shoot her
by the end of all this,

01:06:12.146 --> 01:06:14.015
it'll be a goddamn miracle.

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:19.655
Sorry.

01:06:41.142 --> 01:06:42.111
Beautiful, ain't it?

01:06:42.977 --> 01:06:44.947
I used to play back here
behind the town.

01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:46.881
Love the first snow.

01:06:48.082 --> 01:06:49.885
Watch out for that rock
right there, mister.

01:06:55.289 --> 01:06:57.860
Here we are, town of Big Sky.

01:07:00.294 --> 01:07:03.698
- Wait up.
- Well hurry on up then.

01:07:04.798 --> 01:07:07.135
Stables are empty,
houses are empty.

01:07:08.936 --> 01:07:10.038
I love it.

01:07:11.173 --> 01:07:14.043
This is my favorite street
I think.

01:07:16.311 --> 01:07:18.780
I do think this weather's
gonna lighten up soon.

01:07:19.414 --> 01:07:20.916
Looks to be that way.

01:07:22.182 --> 01:07:23.184
It'll be nice.

01:07:23.383 --> 01:07:24.852
We can go home and start a fire.

01:07:25.787 --> 01:07:27.423
Warm ourselves by the fire.

01:07:28.256 --> 01:07:29.792
Maybe wash off a bit.

01:07:31.025 --> 01:07:31.894
Get some dinner.

01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:35.029
Lighten our packs

01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:37.799
I don't know,
maybe we can get some sleep.

01:07:41.001 --> 01:07:43.204
Oh hey, there's still
firewood out front.

01:07:43.872 --> 01:07:46.842
That's lucky, we don't even
have to go chop it yet.

01:07:48.142 --> 01:07:50.144
Home sweet home.

01:07:53.381 --> 01:07:54.917
Well, come on, mister.

01:07:55.450 --> 01:07:56.852
Didn't you wanna get warm?

01:08:05.093 --> 01:08:06.261
Tomorrow mornin',

01:08:06.494 --> 01:08:08.097
I'll head yonder
to the elk flats.

01:08:08.296 --> 01:08:09.498
Get us a fat bull for dinner.

01:08:10.197 --> 01:08:12.166
Flank steak sounds mighty nice,
don't it?

01:08:12.934 --> 01:08:14.870
Sounds about
damn near perfect.

01:08:17.773 --> 01:08:19.274
Same time, you can go about a
mile and a quarter down the road,

01:08:19.474 --> 01:08:21.175
there's a creek
you can wash up at.

01:08:21.475 --> 01:08:22.777
Get the stink off ya.

01:08:23.478 --> 01:08:25.848
Travel don't do you good,
mister.

01:08:27.115 --> 01:08:28.951
Are ya gonna stand there,
or ya gonna close the door?

01:08:31.185 --> 01:08:32.220
Thank you.

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.087
Thank you.

01:09:44.091 --> 01:09:46.359
Oh, please move Lincoln lover,
I do so implore you.

01:09:46.361 --> 01:09:47.595
I will gut you like a trout.

01:09:49.062 --> 01:09:49.863
Get up.

01:09:50.497 --> 01:09:51.532
C'mon.

01:09:52.299 --> 01:09:53.267
Easy now.

01:09:54.369 --> 01:09:56.470
Now you be civil and drop
them hog's legs you hear?

01:09:57.170 --> 01:09:58.240
Come on, now.

01:10:13.054 --> 01:10:16.291
Some of yer kin wants
to pay his respects.

01:10:28.001 --> 01:10:29.972
Don't look so surprised
to see me.

01:10:31.104 --> 01:10:32.473
You know I've always been good

01:10:32.706 --> 01:10:35.209
at seein' you comin'
from a mile off.

01:10:38.245 --> 01:10:41.047
Let's cut through the small talk
and get right to business.

01:10:41.049 --> 01:10:43.252
That is what we're here
to accomplish, am I right?

01:10:46.387 --> 01:10:50.092
I spent the mornin' ponderin' our little...
predicament here.

01:10:51.224 --> 01:10:53.492
You see, I could just
keep lettin' you chase me

01:10:53.494 --> 01:10:55.461
all across these mountains here

01:10:55.463 --> 01:10:56.497
until you grow tired and...

01:10:57.432 --> 01:10:59.434
settle down
into some sorta normal life.

01:11:00.634 --> 01:11:02.937
But then I remember, Hollis.

01:11:03.504 --> 01:11:04.606
Hollis Ransom.

01:11:05.406 --> 01:11:07.009
Naw, you don't tire.

01:11:08.543 --> 01:11:11.246
It was that last... thought

01:11:11.713 --> 01:11:13.678
that led me
to the conclusion that, uh,

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:15.250
perhaps I oughta just...

01:11:16.517 --> 01:11:17.486
chase you down,

01:11:18.286 --> 01:11:19.621
put a bullet in ya,

01:11:20.588 --> 01:11:22.256
end all this nonsense.

01:11:24.224 --> 01:11:27.129
But, at the end of the day,
you are still family

01:11:27.661 --> 01:11:31.365
and shootin' you just...
It don't seem nice now, does it?

01:11:33.067 --> 01:11:35.103
You see the pickle
you got me in here?

01:11:36.571 --> 01:11:39.073
I thought you was gonna
cut through the small talk.

01:11:42.710 --> 01:11:45.714
All right then,
my mind's made up.

01:11:56.223 --> 01:11:58.559
World don't need
your sadness no more.

01:12:00.027 --> 01:12:01.629
Just lay there and die,
little brother.

01:12:39.299 --> 01:12:40.498
Oh Jesus, get up.

01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:41.436
Come on.

01:12:42.536 --> 01:12:44.837
Oh, God.

01:12:44.839 --> 01:12:49.111
Okay. Oh, I gotta get you...
I gotta get you back to town.

01:12:49.309 --> 01:12:50.211
Oh, God.

01:12:51.146 --> 01:12:54.180
Oh Christ,
it's getting infected.

01:12:54.182 --> 01:12:56.018
I gotta get you outta
this valley, Hollis.

01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:59.787
That's... that's the
first time you've said my name.

01:13:00.554 --> 01:13:02.620
Come on, you gotta help me.

01:13:04.192 --> 01:13:05.227
Come on.

01:13:05.625 --> 01:13:06.561
Come on.

01:13:07.695 --> 01:13:10.232
Come on. I got you.

01:13:11.799 --> 01:13:13.735
Come on, come on.

01:13:14.634 --> 01:13:16.237
Don't die on me, ya hear?

01:13:18.171 --> 01:13:18.740
Come on.

01:13:22.477 --> 01:13:26.311
Okay, come on.

01:13:26.313 --> 01:13:28.082
Okay, come on.

01:13:29.150 --> 01:13:30.716
All right. Right here, Hollis.
Ready?

01:13:30.718 --> 01:13:32.586
One, two, three.

01:13:35.122 --> 01:13:37.722
Okay, just hold on one minute,
Hollis.

01:13:44.564 --> 01:13:45.800
- Okay.
- Hey.

01:13:47.869 --> 01:13:49.804
You're gonna wanna
bite down on this.

01:13:52.906 --> 01:13:55.576
Okay, okay.

01:14:04.451 --> 01:14:05.419
Here we go.

01:14:23.670 --> 01:14:24.606
Okay.

01:14:35.415 --> 01:14:37.284
I gotta hurt you
one more time, Hollis.

01:14:38.286 --> 01:14:39.754
And I'm real sorry about it.

01:14:43.657 --> 01:14:45.759
Okay.

01:15:09.482 --> 01:15:12.219
Dirty sumbitch doesn't have
a scratch on his head

01:15:21.995 --> 01:15:24.829
Boss, I'm afraid I got some news

01:15:24.831 --> 01:15:26.535
you ain't gon'
appreciate very much.

01:15:27.535 --> 01:15:28.603
What is it?

01:15:29.670 --> 01:15:32.607
I just come on down
from where's we was earlier.

01:15:33.241 --> 01:15:35.210
Two sets of tracks
and a blood trail.

01:15:36.477 --> 01:15:39.281
It would appear your
dear-old family tie

01:15:39.613 --> 01:15:40.615
done cheated the reaper.

01:15:41.549 --> 01:15:43.785
Perambulated himself on down
into Big Sky.

01:15:46.519 --> 01:15:47.955
Where do you reckon
they be hidin'?

01:15:48.455 --> 01:15:50.321
I've got a dollar
says that he's holed up

01:15:50.323 --> 01:15:52.294
in the trapper's
cabin by the livery.

01:15:53.294 --> 01:15:55.897
Well,
you boys go finish the job then.

01:16:19.653 --> 01:16:20.789
Hey, there.

01:16:25.026 --> 01:16:26.928
How you feelin', gunslinger?

01:16:27.894 --> 01:16:30.764
Like I've been shot.

01:16:31.299 --> 01:16:34.302
Well that's mighty aware of ya.

01:16:36.437 --> 01:16:37.305
My brother.

01:16:39.874 --> 01:16:40.809
What?

01:16:43.643 --> 01:16:44.646
All my hate...

01:16:49.784 --> 01:16:51.385
It's for my brother.

01:16:52.385 --> 01:16:52.920
Why?

01:16:54.054 --> 01:16:55.557
Check your pocket.

01:17:11.671 --> 01:17:15.843
One of my slaves, Rufus,

01:17:16.677 --> 01:17:17.978
he had a daughter.

01:17:19.379 --> 01:17:21.048
She was just
a few years younger than me.

01:17:25.553 --> 01:17:26.554
Adeline.

01:17:28.455 --> 01:17:30.592
I never looked at 'em
any different.

01:17:31.025 --> 01:17:32.557
Probably on account
of my mother,

01:17:32.559 --> 01:17:34.428
she was always treatin'
him like they were just...

01:17:34.661 --> 01:17:35.763
regular white folk.

01:17:38.064 --> 01:17:40.701
Used to make Dad so angry.

01:17:45.638 --> 01:17:47.739
One day Adeline and I
went out to the orchard

01:17:47.741 --> 01:17:48.842
to pick some apples.

01:17:51.579 --> 01:17:52.447
<i>They was...</i>

01:17:54.013 --> 01:17:55.949
damn sweet apples.

01:18:00.821 --> 01:18:02.323
Adeline leaned in and kissed me.

01:18:09.729 --> 01:18:12.400
We started makin'
frequent visits to the orchard.

01:18:13.401 --> 01:18:14.969
<i>Kept it secret
for quite some time.</i>

01:18:19.706 --> 01:18:20.642
Till one day...

01:18:23.943 --> 01:18:25.612
that war come callin'.

01:18:28.648 --> 01:18:31.585
Oh, Daddy was so proud
of Everett when he decided

01:18:32.585 --> 01:18:34.688
he was gonna sign
up with the Confederates.

01:18:37.657 --> 01:18:39.727
Adeline and I
went up to that orchard.

01:18:42.629 --> 01:18:44.631
<i>I asked what she
think we should do.</i>

01:18:49.003 --> 01:18:49.903
She said...

01:18:52.071 --> 01:18:55.509
<i>"Just run away, head West,</i>

01:18:56.544 --> 01:18:58.646
<i>and get clear away
from that war and all.</i>

01:18:59.146 --> 01:19:00.514
All the hate."

01:19:03.483 --> 01:19:04.785
I told her she was right.

01:19:07.888 --> 01:19:09.057
We'd leave that night.

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:21.936
<i>So I kissed her.</i>

01:19:26.807 --> 01:19:28.809
I went to go
put our things together.

01:19:36.616 --> 01:19:38.786
I left her in that orchard.

01:19:40.854 --> 01:19:44.058
But I did not know my brother
Everett was up in that tree.

01:19:45.558 --> 01:19:47.561
<i>I come back just before sunset.</i>

01:19:49.863 --> 01:19:51.433
I found her hung.

01:20:00.206 --> 01:20:02.177
<i>Buried her right there
under that tree.</i>

01:20:06.981 --> 01:20:08.582
I mounted my horse.

01:20:09.582 --> 01:20:11.152
I rode straight
through the night...

01:20:13.187 --> 01:20:15.490
to the first Union camp
I could find.

01:20:18.025 --> 01:20:20.862
I signed my papers, I had a
gun in my hand ever since.

01:20:25.799 --> 01:20:29.237
After the war,
I followed Everett out West.

01:20:31.205 --> 01:20:32.640
Right here to Montana.

01:20:37.745 --> 01:20:39.581
Had to do somethin'
to make a livin',

01:20:40.313 --> 01:20:41.715
support my efforts in...

01:20:43.717 --> 01:20:44.751
tryna find him.

01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:50.824
I think I just settled
in the occupation,

01:20:52.326 --> 01:20:54.529
forgot what it was
I was doin' out here.

01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:01.969
That is so sad.

01:21:06.874 --> 01:21:08.943
I hope you make it to Chicago,
Rose.

01:21:12.245 --> 01:21:14.047
I hope you get
everything you want.

01:21:15.883 --> 01:21:18.786
I would not have made it
this far if it wasn't for you.

01:21:21.287 --> 01:21:22.756
Just so's you know that.

01:21:34.934 --> 01:21:36.303
You've taken a fever.

01:21:41.008 --> 01:21:42.274
It's gonna be a long night,

01:21:42.276 --> 01:21:44.178
but hopefully by morning
it'll be broke.

01:21:44.812 --> 01:21:45.847
Hmm...

01:21:53.687 --> 01:21:55.557
I'm gonna get
some more wood for the fire.

01:21:58.325 --> 01:21:59.861
You try and get some rest.

01:22:03.229 --> 01:22:04.631
Go back to sleep now.

01:22:32.692 --> 01:22:36.296
Here kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty.

01:22:47.174 --> 01:22:48.376
Well hello there, Miss.

01:22:48.875 --> 01:22:50.976
What might you be doin'
out here all alone

01:22:50.978 --> 01:22:52.880
on a cold dark
night such as this?

01:22:53.347 --> 01:22:55.049
What's it look like I'm doin'?

01:22:55.415 --> 01:22:58.318
Hoo! She got a mouth on her,
this one does.

01:22:59.452 --> 01:23:02.389
Where's that crusty headhunter
you've been leadin' around?

01:23:04.191 --> 01:23:05.326
He ain't here.

01:23:06.893 --> 01:23:08.362
He got injured
and headed back to town.

01:23:08.995 --> 01:23:10.895
I stayed to see if I could
bag me an elk.

01:23:10.897 --> 01:23:13.034
Didn't want the trip
to go to waste and all.

01:23:14.268 --> 01:23:16.270
- Is that so?
- Mm-hmm.

01:23:16.937 --> 01:23:18.339
Well, now...

01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:22.043
guess that means
you wouldn't mind if we...

01:23:22.476 --> 01:23:24.778
come in and take
a little look around then.

01:23:25.312 --> 01:23:26.848
Go on now.

01:23:27.214 --> 01:23:28.750
Give us a look see then,
will ya?

01:23:37.424 --> 01:23:39.861
You boys want me
to put some coffee on?

01:23:43.330 --> 01:23:44.365
Goddammit!

01:23:47.735 --> 01:23:48.934
Where the hell's he at?

01:23:48.936 --> 01:23:51.139
Sumbitch has to
be in the environ somewhere.

01:23:51.839 --> 01:23:54.976
I told you he got injured
and headed back to town.

01:23:55.476 --> 01:23:57.476
I also told you
I went a-huntin'.

01:23:57.478 --> 01:23:59.113
That's elk's blood
outside is all.

01:24:00.347 --> 01:24:01.249
Coffee?

01:24:16.362 --> 01:24:19.196
Hellfire! Looks like
you done killed yourself a door!

01:24:19.198 --> 01:24:21.201
Shut your damn mouth,
ya ignorant wretch!

01:24:29.076 --> 01:24:31.412
Now I hate to inform you,
girly girl...

01:24:35.549 --> 01:24:37.414
but I did in fact
see the gentleman

01:24:37.416 --> 01:24:40.088
with whom you've been
gallivantin' get shot today.

01:24:41.522 --> 01:24:43.024
What I did not see

01:24:43.924 --> 01:24:46.794
was a second blood trail
comin' down out them hills

01:24:47.027 --> 01:24:49.363
leadin' me to believe that
you killed yourself an elk.

01:24:51.130 --> 01:24:55.335
So, I'm only gonna pose
this question one more time

01:24:57.271 --> 01:25:01.108
and I killed girls plenty...
plenty prettier than you.

01:25:03.177 --> 01:25:04.211
Where's he at?

01:25:17.089 --> 01:25:18.159
Cocksucker!

01:25:44.518 --> 01:25:46.020
Well that was unexpected.

01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:48.022
Who the hell were they?

01:25:48.621 --> 01:25:51.021
- Everett's boys.
- Goddamn.

01:25:51.023 --> 01:25:52.526
First light comes
and they ain't back,

01:25:53.059 --> 01:25:56.062
Everett's gonna send everything
he can muster at this place.

01:26:03.303 --> 01:26:04.205
Then we'll be ready.

01:26:05.973 --> 01:26:08.242
We won't be doin' anything.

01:26:08.575 --> 01:26:11.443
You need to get yourself home, Rose.
It's too dangerous.

01:26:11.445 --> 01:26:14.511
I will not have another woman's life hangin' over my head.

01:26:14.513 --> 01:26:15.881
That is not an option.

01:26:15.883 --> 01:26:17.082
Now you listen here, Rose.

01:26:17.084 --> 01:26:19.053
No you listen here,
Hollis Ransom!

01:26:19.887 --> 01:26:21.923
Two will always be
better than one.

01:26:22.656 --> 01:26:24.355
And when the shooting
does start,

01:26:24.357 --> 01:26:27.128
I reckon you're gonna
need another set of hands.

01:26:28.027 --> 01:26:32.329
And lest we not forget,
you still owe me 1,000 dollars

01:26:32.331 --> 01:26:34.632
and there ain't no way I'm lettin'
ya outta my sight unpaid.

01:26:34.634 --> 01:26:36.102
Are we clear on all that?

01:26:36.335 --> 01:26:37.537
- Fine!
- Fine!

01:26:40.374 --> 01:26:44.178
The shootin' starts,
you best make yourself small.

01:26:44.378 --> 01:26:46.112
Are we clear on that?

01:26:49.215 --> 01:26:49.983
Yes, mister.

01:26:56.188 --> 01:26:57.991
Go on, take the bed.

01:26:59.393 --> 01:27:00.394
I'll keep watch.

01:27:06.165 --> 01:27:07.300
Ya need rest.

01:27:10.637 --> 01:27:13.241
I need my vengeance.

01:27:16.108 --> 01:27:17.044
Now go on.

01:27:41.201 --> 01:27:44.338
Cap'n, Pickett and Tommy
never come back last night.

01:27:45.205 --> 01:27:47.004
What do you mean
they didn't come back?

01:27:47.006 --> 01:27:49.210
I reckon we may've lost two more men.

01:27:52.446 --> 01:27:54.081
Wake up the rest of the boys,

01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:56.182
tell 'em to shake
the lead outta their bones.

01:27:57.049 --> 01:27:58.585
We got murderin' to do.

01:27:59.152 --> 01:27:59.686
Yes, sir.

01:29:08.554 --> 01:29:09.622
Mornin' old timer.

01:29:11.791 --> 01:29:13.624
Lookin' for a grizzly bear
of a man

01:29:13.626 --> 01:29:16.664
with a pretty little Philly
taggin' along behind him.

01:29:23.269 --> 01:29:24.338
Much obliged.

01:30:06.345 --> 01:30:07.415
All right, boys.

01:30:08.115 --> 01:30:10.050
Knowin' my brother,
he ain't gone far.

01:30:11.151 --> 01:30:13.220
Let's turn this shithole
inside out and find him.

01:30:13.652 --> 01:30:14.588
Come with me.

01:31:02.469 --> 01:31:03.404
Shit!

01:32:17.710 --> 01:32:19.713
Get your eyes on that eye patch.

01:33:01.588 --> 01:33:02.889
Wait. Wait.

01:33:14.867 --> 01:33:16.303
How ya doin', old timer?

01:33:51.838 --> 01:33:53.040
Where's your Hollis Ransom now?

01:33:53.505 --> 01:33:56.043
My brother never could
keep a woman alive.

01:34:07.454 --> 01:34:09.356
Go on die now, go to sleep.

01:34:15.762 --> 01:34:17.497
Everett!

01:34:40.519 --> 01:34:41.522
Come on!

01:34:49.027 --> 01:34:50.897
This is where we
say goodbye, Rose.

01:34:53.098 --> 01:34:54.901
Every man here is
worth somethin'.

01:34:55.535 --> 01:34:57.537
Far more than I was plannin'
on paying you.

01:34:59.406 --> 01:35:01.538
More than enough
to get you to Chicago

01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:02.909
and live out
that dream of yours.

01:35:06.146 --> 01:35:07.947
I can't leave you, you're hurt.

01:35:11.617 --> 01:35:13.519
Ain't no negotiatin'
on this, Rose.

01:35:14.754 --> 01:35:15.823
Now you head back now.

01:35:17.055 --> 01:35:19.526
You leave me to do
what I gotta do.

01:35:23.028 --> 01:35:23.929
Just promise me.

01:35:25.432 --> 01:35:27.568
You promise me
that you'll go live your life

01:35:27.933 --> 01:35:29.369
and you live it how you wanna.

01:35:31.704 --> 01:35:32.438
Promise me.

01:35:37.009 --> 01:35:40.079
I promise.

01:35:44.817 --> 01:35:45.651
I got him real good.

01:35:47.152 --> 01:35:49.455
All ya have to do
is follow his trail.

01:35:59.165 --> 01:36:00.167
Thank you, Rose,

01:36:02.634 --> 01:36:03.637
for everything.

01:37:21.246 --> 01:37:23.616
Fittin' a place as any I suppose

01:37:24.317 --> 01:37:27.254
for God
and all his angels to witness.

01:37:31.023 --> 01:37:32.593
She never did fight, you know.

01:37:35.295 --> 01:37:36.897
She knew it was comin'.

01:37:37.563 --> 01:37:38.965
Nothin' she could do about it.

01:37:41.334 --> 01:37:43.604
When that noose
slipped around her neck

01:37:44.771 --> 01:37:49.942
and those tears,
those tears just kept fallin'.

01:37:52.612 --> 01:37:55.549
And you,
you were nowhere to be found.

01:37:55.848 --> 01:37:59.950
Her eyes were searchin',
hopin' you would come out

01:37:59.952 --> 01:38:03.756
from among those apple trees,
waitin' for you to save her.

01:38:09.228 --> 01:38:11.532
I still remember
your face that day.

01:38:13.066 --> 01:38:15.669
You were so goddamn happy.

01:38:17.704 --> 01:38:20.807
I just couldn't shake
the feelin' that some nigger

01:38:21.139 --> 01:38:23.943
was gonna steal
my little brother away from me.

01:39:50.429 --> 01:39:52.231
It didn't have to be like this,
brother.

01:39:54.834 --> 01:39:56.336
We're supposed to
stick together.

01:39:57.269 --> 01:39:58.205
We're kin.

01:40:11.349 --> 01:40:13.653
Went around her neck
just as easily.

01:40:16.856 --> 01:40:19.726
Lay with a nigger,
die like a nigger.

01:41:12.778 --> 01:41:13.879
Goodbye, brother.

01:42:36.862 --> 01:42:38.097
Who the hell are you?

01:42:38.296 --> 01:42:39.098
My name is Rose Gage

01:42:40.131 --> 01:42:42.102
and I'm here
to collect my money, sir.

01:42:43.369 --> 01:42:44.905
And who is this gentleman?

01:42:45.204 --> 01:42:47.307
You know who he is,
Mr. Carrington.

01:42:48.273 --> 01:42:50.811
There's supposed to be
a few more, aren't there?

01:42:53.478 --> 01:42:55.145
Well pardon me
for not bein' able

01:42:55.147 --> 01:42:57.050
to carry 'em all
back here for ya.

01:42:57.450 --> 01:43:00.083
But if you'd like to take
a gander out there in the snow,

01:43:00.085 --> 01:43:02.319
I can show you
where I hid the others.

01:43:02.321 --> 01:43:04.457
Well...

01:43:09.161 --> 01:43:11.628
I've learned that
at this particular occupation

01:43:11.630 --> 01:43:13.098
trust goes a long way.

01:43:15.902 --> 01:43:19.102
I will pay you 1,000 dollars
for a job well done,

01:43:19.104 --> 01:43:21.905
even though it was supposed
to be Hollis Ransom

01:43:21.907 --> 01:43:23.576
- walkin' through that door.
- Five.

01:43:25.344 --> 01:43:26.379
Five?

01:43:27.013 --> 01:43:30.116
You will give me 5,000 dollars,
sir.

01:43:37.423 --> 01:43:39.960
<i>I learned everything
I could from Hollis Ransom.</i>

01:43:41.093 --> 01:43:44.360
<i>Most importantly
that hate will devour a man</i>

01:43:44.362 --> 01:43:45.865
<i>faster than a grizzly can.</i>

01:43:47.099 --> 01:43:51.001
<i>Hollis knew that,
but chose to hold it close,</i>

01:43:51.003 --> 01:43:52.938
<i>never regrettin'
the choices he made.</i>

01:43:54.607 --> 01:43:56.243
<i>He gave me a new life</i>

01:43:57.375 --> 01:44:00.546
<i>and for that,
I wish I could thank him.</i>

01:44:09.455 --> 01:44:12.325
<i>Maybe someday I will get to.</i>
