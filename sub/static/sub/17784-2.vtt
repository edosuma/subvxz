WEBVTT

00:20.754 --> 00:23.091
Ever consider law?

00:23.157 --> 00:24.825
- Not really.
- He should.

00:24.892 --> 00:27.395
He's got the mind for it.
He's very argumentative.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.963
- I am not.
- I rest my case.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.565
Sorry I'm late.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.501
- Hey, Mom.
- I had an early call
with a client.

00:33.567 --> 00:37.471
Hi, sweetie.
So how's the new job, Sam?

00:37.538 --> 00:39.907
Great, great,
deeply fulfilling,
like a prostate exam.

00:39.973 --> 00:43.111
- So poetic.
- Well, what do you
want me to say?

00:43.177 --> 00:44.912
It's the IRS, not Greenpeace.

00:44.978 --> 00:46.647
Should we get started?

00:46.714 --> 00:49.483
Okay, folks,
we're in the home stretch.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.685
I filed the dissolution
of marriage petition.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.587
I'm just waiting to hear back
about a court date.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.623
And since you're both waving
rights to spousal support,

00:55.689 --> 00:58.092
and aren't contesting
the division of assets,

00:58.159 --> 01:00.561
I expect things
to proceed smoothly.

01:00.628 --> 01:02.696
What about the money
from the sale of the house?

01:02.763 --> 01:06.134
Oh, it's all held in escrow
until the divorce is finalized.

01:06.200 --> 01:09.036
- Any other questions?
- Yeah, should we talk about
child custody?

01:09.137 --> 01:12.039
- What?
- Well, because Sam
and I were thinking

01:12.140 --> 01:14.908
we would do every other week,
and alternate holidays would
work best.

01:14.975 --> 01:18.779
- Mom, I'm 21 years old.
- Honey, the grownups
are talking.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.517
Okay, I gotta go.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.853
Honey?
Just a second.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.456
Your mom and I wanna talk
to you about something.

01:30.358 --> 01:32.193
Well, sweetie, you know,

01:32.260 --> 01:34.528
now that your dad and I
both have good jobs--

01:34.595 --> 01:35.763
Well, jobs.

01:35.829 --> 01:38.699
...and we actually came out
ahead on the house sale,

01:38.766 --> 01:42.570
Thanks to your mom's great
work as listing agent.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.805
So we were thinking
we can afford

01:44.872 --> 01:46.440
to help you out with school,

01:46.507 --> 01:49.343
if you'd like to re-enroll
at NYU in the fall.

01:49.410 --> 01:52.012
And maybe you, uh--

01:52.079 --> 01:54.615
you give dorm living
a try, huh?

01:54.682 --> 01:56.517
Seriously?

01:56.584 --> 01:59.453
That's amazing.

01:59.520 --> 02:00.754
Oh!

02:00.821 --> 02:02.856
Come here, come here.
Go on, get out of here.

02:02.923 --> 02:06.093
You don't wanna be late
your first day back.

02:06.194 --> 02:08.696
Bye.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.965
Okay, it is so nice
to see him smile.

02:12.032 --> 02:13.734
He has been in
such a funk lately.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.437
I don't know why he hates
that community college.

02:16.504 --> 02:17.871
It's a lovely campus.

02:17.938 --> 02:20.608
That's not why
he's been so down.

02:20.674 --> 02:21.942
No?

02:22.009 --> 02:23.711
No. No.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.379
He misses his girlfriend.

02:34.087 --> 02:35.856
So how are you doing?

02:35.923 --> 02:38.559
Oh, I'm-- I'm good.

02:38.626 --> 02:40.694
Busy. You?

02:42.062 --> 02:44.265
- Better.
- Hmm.

02:44.332 --> 02:47.901
Not still eating
frozen dinners, I hope?

02:47.968 --> 02:51.239
You'll be happy to know
that I prepared myself
a salad the other night.

02:51.272 --> 02:54.575
Oh, look at you.

02:54.642 --> 02:57.811
Although the apartment gets
a little lonely sometimes.

02:57.878 --> 03:01.148
- Yeah.
- I've made some friends.

03:01.249 --> 03:02.850
- Hmm.
- One guy, you'd love.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.352
He's my supervisor at work.

03:04.418 --> 03:07.655
Terry. He's a black fella.
He's terrific.

03:09.357 --> 03:11.158
You know, you don't have
to mention he's black.

03:11.259 --> 03:12.960
But he is.

03:13.026 --> 03:17.064
Yeah, but it's not really
relevant is my point,

03:17.130 --> 03:20.701
and it could be misconstrued
as a little bit, you know--

03:20.768 --> 03:21.869
What?

03:21.935 --> 03:23.271
Racist.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.307
Terry's not racist.

03:29.677 --> 03:32.513
Well, I'll be glad
when this is all over.

03:32.580 --> 03:36.016
It'll be nice to get
out of our caves

03:36.083 --> 03:38.619
and just get on
with our lives.

03:41.622 --> 03:42.623
Yeah.

03:55.303 --> 03:57.671
**

04:00.408 --> 04:03.411
* Oh, Caroline *

04:03.477 --> 04:06.447
* You got to get away *

04:06.514 --> 04:08.749
* Oh, Caroline *

04:08.816 --> 04:11.519
Huh?

04:11.585 --> 04:13.421
It's good morning
in Japanese.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.188
Since when do you know
Japanese?

04:15.323 --> 04:16.690
Since I started
teaching myself.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.359
I figure they're gonna
buy Red Oaks one day.

04:18.426 --> 04:19.893
I mean, they already own
half of Manhattan,

04:19.960 --> 04:22.363
and they're crazy about golf,
also mayonnaise.

04:22.430 --> 04:25.899
Shouldn't you be spending
your time learning how
to mix cocktails?

04:25.966 --> 04:27.801
Working on that, too.

04:27.868 --> 04:31.004
- Another letter from Paris?
- Yeah.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.242
Any word yet on when
she's getting back?

04:35.343 --> 04:36.777
Next week sometime.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.879
She says she has some stuff
she needs to wrap up

04:38.946 --> 04:40.047
before she comes home.

04:46.253 --> 04:49.156
Wow. If it was me,

04:49.222 --> 04:50.991
I'd have chosen Paris
over here.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.960
No offense, you know,
I'd miss you and all,

04:53.026 --> 04:55.363
but c'est la vie, David.

04:58.899 --> 05:01.469
**

05:03.404 --> 05:05.406
* Ooh, yeah *

05:20.421 --> 05:24.124
* Sha-la-la-la-la-la my lady *

05:24.191 --> 05:28.028
* In the sun
with your hair undone *

05:28.095 --> 05:30.831
* Can you hear me now
calling your name *

05:30.898 --> 05:33.767
* From across the bay? *

05:33.834 --> 05:35.268
**

05:35.403 --> 05:37.705
Dude, you ever had sex
on a beach?

05:37.771 --> 05:40.073
Technically, no.
But one time back
in high school,

05:40.140 --> 05:41.709
me and Karen snuck into
the athletic field at night

05:41.775 --> 05:44.144
and did it
in the long jump pit.

05:44.211 --> 05:46.914
Didn't she get sand
in her, you know, uh, hoo-ha?

05:46.980 --> 05:48.048
She was on top.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.651
What?

05:55.889 --> 05:57.658
You never told me how it went
with Misty last night.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.259
- You guys have the talk?
- Nah.

05:59.326 --> 06:02.496
- Well, what happened?
- Same thing that always does.

06:02.563 --> 06:03.897
We hung out.
It was awesome.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.799
Felt like we were
boyfriend and girlfriend,

06:05.866 --> 06:07.701
except for the
not having sex part.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.837
And the second I try
to steer the conversation

06:09.903 --> 06:11.572
to "what the fuck
is going on with us,"

06:11.639 --> 06:13.173
she got all evasive

06:13.240 --> 06:15.876
and suddenly realized she had
to study, and then split.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.445
Dude, you can't let it
go on like this.

06:17.478 --> 06:19.747
I know.
What's so frustrating is

06:19.813 --> 06:21.449
I really felt like
I was making progress.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.016
Like that time
we were both baked

06:23.083 --> 06:25.819
and she let me feel her boobs
before we passed out?

06:25.886 --> 06:27.354
So confusing.

06:27.455 --> 06:28.456
I know you're sick
of me saying this,

06:28.456 --> 06:29.857
but you need to confront her.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.025
You can't keep letting her
dodge the subject.

06:35.128 --> 06:36.464
You're right.

06:36.464 --> 06:37.731
I'm gonna do it.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.099
Tonight.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.568
Okay.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.073
Yo, Wheeler!

06:46.139 --> 06:49.577
What's this I hear about you
not working valet anymore?

06:49.643 --> 06:51.211
Yeah! You too good
for us or something?

06:51.278 --> 06:52.613
Gentlemen,
you are looking at

06:52.680 --> 06:54.582
the new Red Oaks Grille's
bartender.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.617
You better hook us up
with some free booze.

06:56.684 --> 07:00.521
Yeah, like I'd risk my job
stealing alcohol for you
two joysticks.

07:00.588 --> 07:04.057
Hey, we're not joysticks.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.499
As I live and breathe.

07:11.532 --> 07:15.536
Boychick, look at you.
Come here and give me
a man hug, will you?

07:15.603 --> 07:17.705
Come on, put some pelvis
into it, huh?

07:17.771 --> 07:20.173
- Okay.
- You've been working out.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.042
How was Boca?

07:22.109 --> 07:24.978
I didn't end up making it
out to Boca, actually.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.179
- No?
- Nah.

07:26.246 --> 07:29.016
There was just too much
going on around here--

07:29.082 --> 07:31.519
...between Father's prostate

07:31.519 --> 07:34.555
and, um, my divorce.

07:34.622 --> 07:36.757
What? Holy shit.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.561
Nash, what happened?

07:41.629 --> 07:44.532
Who's to say?

07:44.598 --> 07:46.099
Perhaps we got married
too young.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.969
We'd been drifting apart
for a while.

07:49.036 --> 07:52.906
Also she gave me gonorrhea.
So there's that.

07:52.973 --> 07:56.744
But I'm okay.
I'm over it...

07:56.810 --> 08:00.548
after months of therapy
and an aggressive regimen
of antibiotics.

08:02.916 --> 08:06.920
- I'm really sorry, man.
- Oh, don't be. It's fine.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.221
I'm fine.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.723
No, I'm better than fine.

08:09.790 --> 08:12.125
Besides, what better balm
for a broken heart

08:12.192 --> 08:14.895
than to get back out there
and start sewing your wild oats,

08:14.962 --> 08:17.631
and planting some rows
of corn and potatoes besides?

08:17.698 --> 08:19.166
If you catch my drift.

08:21.468 --> 08:24.437
Ah! I just had the most
marvelous idea.

08:24.572 --> 08:25.673
What?

08:25.739 --> 08:27.841
You, me, tonight,
kickoff kegger.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.043
I wasn't really planning
on going this year.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.012
You don't have to plan a thing.
I'll take care of it all.

08:32.079 --> 08:34.848
I'll pick you up and provide
the snacks and the blue curacao.

08:34.915 --> 08:37.250
All you have to do
is wear a clean shirt.

08:37.317 --> 08:38.752
This is going to be fantastic.

08:38.819 --> 08:41.121
We'll be each other's wingmen.

08:42.590 --> 08:45.058
- I can't, Nash.
- Why not?

08:45.125 --> 08:46.459
'Cause I'm not really
in the mood,

08:46.594 --> 08:48.161
and I'm seeing someone.

08:48.228 --> 08:50.798
- Who?
- Skye.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.601
Getty's daughter?
But I thought she was in France.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.603
She is,
but she's coming back.

08:55.603 --> 08:58.205
That settles it.
You're coming with me tonight.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.741
I won't have you moping about
like some fish wife

09:00.808 --> 09:02.910
pining for her sailor
to return from the seas.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.612
We're going to have
fun tonight, god damn it.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.213
And you are going
to get me laid.

09:06.279 --> 09:09.983
Okay, yeah.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.152
**

09:12.219 --> 09:15.222
Hey, kid,
don't give yourself a hernia.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.624
All right.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.358
Let's try this again, Herb.

09:18.425 --> 09:20.527
Here we go.

09:20.628 --> 09:22.630
All right?
One Manhattan coming up.

09:22.630 --> 09:23.631
Looks good.

09:23.631 --> 09:25.799
The, uh...

09:25.866 --> 09:28.669
Shit!

09:28.736 --> 09:31.038
Oh, here you go.

09:34.507 --> 09:36.076
We'll give it a taste.

09:37.645 --> 09:40.380
How is it?

09:40.447 --> 09:42.816
- Too sweet.
- Still?

09:42.883 --> 09:44.818
It's a Manhattan,
not a Shirley Temple.

09:44.885 --> 09:47.354
It should taste like
getting mugged at gunpoint.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.457
Just-- I'll try again.
Just let me run these
out to the pool.

09:50.523 --> 09:52.392
Okay.

09:52.459 --> 09:55.228
Oh, boy.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.130
Okay.

10:00.801 --> 10:03.837
- Hey.
- Hi.

10:03.904 --> 10:07.074
- How you doing?
- Good.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.876
How about you?
How you been?

10:08.942 --> 10:10.944
I heard something
about you going to school

10:11.011 --> 10:12.713
- like, uh, to clean teeth.
- Yeah.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.782
Yeah, it's been going good.

10:14.848 --> 10:17.284
Yeah, no shit. That's wild,

10:17.350 --> 10:19.319
Yeah. How's the band?

10:19.386 --> 10:20.754
We broke up.

10:20.821 --> 10:23.123
Oh, I'm sorry. Wow.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.558
No, those guys were ass-wipes.
They were holding me back.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.928
No, no, no, I've been focusing
more on my solo stuff.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.330
- Okay.
- I'll bring you a demo tape.

10:30.397 --> 10:31.699
I think you'd really dig it.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.734
Like, it's more acoustic.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.803
Like, ballads and shit.

10:35.869 --> 10:37.671
Exploring your sensitive side.

10:37.738 --> 10:40.407
- Exactly.
- Hey, Misty.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.742
- Hi.
- Steve.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.276
What do you want, lug nuts?

10:43.343 --> 10:45.746
Uh, to talk to Misty?

10:48.115 --> 10:49.416
I gotta get back to work.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.484
- Bye.
- Fuck you.

10:51.551 --> 10:53.586
Listen,

10:53.653 --> 10:55.355
there's something
I really need to talk
to you about.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.457
- Okay.
- So...

10:57.524 --> 10:59.893
- I feel like we've been
avoiding--

10:59.960 --> 11:02.930
Walk! Sorry. Go ahead.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.232
Um, like I was saying,

11:05.298 --> 11:07.634
I'm just a little confused
because--

11:09.002 --> 11:11.404
No diving!
Wheeler, can we talk later?

11:11.471 --> 11:13.273
How about tonight?

11:13.340 --> 11:15.375
I got class.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.610
Fuck.

11:17.745 --> 11:18.746
Can you skip?

11:18.812 --> 11:20.247
I have a test.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.116
Okay.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.285
You better deliver those
before they melt.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.755
Yeah, okay.

11:43.470 --> 11:46.373
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:46.439 --> 11:47.607
How are you?

11:47.674 --> 11:49.810
Good.

11:49.877 --> 11:52.045
It's been a long time.

11:52.112 --> 11:53.781
I know.

11:53.847 --> 11:56.383
How's community college?

11:56.449 --> 11:57.450
Shitty.

11:57.517 --> 11:58.919
But, uh, good news is

11:58.986 --> 12:00.620
I'm going back to NYU
starting the fall.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.355
That's great.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.024
How's modeling?

12:04.091 --> 12:06.794
Good. Yeah.
Barry got me a Sears circular.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.295
Oh, cool.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.030
How is Barry?

12:10.097 --> 12:12.365
Hilarious, as always.

12:12.432 --> 12:16.169
Um, yeah, that's actually
the reason I stopped by.

12:16.236 --> 12:21.408
I wanted to tell you before
you heard it from anyone else.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.811
Tell me what?

12:23.811 --> 12:25.813
Um...

12:25.879 --> 12:28.315
Barry and I are, well...

12:29.817 --> 12:31.451
Wow.

12:31.518 --> 12:32.820
That's fast.

12:32.886 --> 12:35.088
Yeah, I mean,
it's crazy, I know,

12:35.155 --> 12:36.656
but I can't really
believe it, either.

12:36.723 --> 12:38.291
It's not like we're kids,
though.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.828
Barry's 30, and I'm almost
done with my RN, so...

12:40.894 --> 12:42.362
Yeah.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.998
Well, congratulations.

12:46.299 --> 12:47.534
Thanks.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.302
Do you guys have
a date and stuff?

12:49.369 --> 12:51.071
August 23rd.

12:51.138 --> 12:53.140
That'll be here
before you know it.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.475
Yeah, still like a zillion
things I have to do.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.945
You have no idea how many
decisions are involved
in planning a wedding,

12:58.011 --> 13:00.280
even a small one
in my parents' backyard.

13:00.347 --> 13:01.381
Yeah.

13:03.183 --> 13:06.854
I'm happy for you.
It's what you always wanted.

13:09.056 --> 13:11.324
I have a class,
so I'm gonna get going.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.368
- Another Coke.
- Thanks.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.569
No problem.

13:24.671 --> 13:27.274
- SATs?
- I'm re-taking them
next Saturday.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.109
My dad says if I don't
bring my scores up,

13:29.176 --> 13:30.878
he's sending me
to military school.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.880
That sucks.
What did you get the last time?

13:32.946 --> 13:34.781
940. I'm pretty stupid.

13:34.882 --> 13:38.485
Nah, man. Standardized
tests have nothing
to do with intelligence.

13:38.551 --> 13:39.519
They're a racket.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.021
They exist for
the sole purpose

13:41.088 --> 13:43.023
of selling No. 2 pencils.

13:43.090 --> 13:46.526
Beating the SATs
is like beating the house
in Blackjack.

13:46.593 --> 13:49.196
You play the percentages,
count cards.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.331
Beat 'em at their own game.

13:51.398 --> 13:52.432
How?

13:54.667 --> 13:57.237
Okay, for instance...

13:57.304 --> 14:00.407
Everyone works their way
through the sections
of the test in sequence

14:00.473 --> 14:01.608
like good like lemmings.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.443
But why?
Nothing in the rules say

14:03.510 --> 14:04.978
you have to do
reading comprehension

14:05.045 --> 14:06.513
before similes.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.348
In fact, you shouldn't,

14:08.415 --> 14:10.683
'cause it takes three times
as long, yet it's worth
the same points.

14:10.750 --> 14:13.553
So it makes more sense to skip
over reading comprehension

14:13.620 --> 14:15.655
and only come back to it
later if you have time left.

14:15.722 --> 14:19.026
You're pretty smart.
What did you get on your SATs?

14:20.660 --> 14:22.229
1580.

14:22.295 --> 14:25.732
That's, like,
almost a perfect score.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.067
Why didn't you go to college?

14:27.134 --> 14:28.468
I did for a year.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.703
Dropped out.
It wasn't my scene.

14:30.770 --> 14:33.941
That whole Ivory Tower thing
is kind of bogus, you know?

14:36.843 --> 14:38.211
What?

14:38.278 --> 14:40.113
You know,
we kind of look alike.

14:40.180 --> 14:43.583
- Do we?
- It's close enough.

14:43.650 --> 14:46.386
For what?

14:46.453 --> 14:48.989
For you to pretend to be me
and take the SATs in my place.

14:49.056 --> 14:52.159
Okay, why would I do that?

14:52.225 --> 14:54.194
Because I'll pay you
a hundred bucks.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.596
Two hundred.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.631
Cash.

14:58.698 --> 15:01.368
Please, Wheeler,
I can't go to military school.

15:01.434 --> 15:04.104
Did you see "Taps"?
Those guys are psycho.

15:09.809 --> 15:14.181
Okay. I'll do it. Fuck.

15:15.782 --> 15:18.251
Okay, over here, Rambo.
Say fromage.

15:18.318 --> 15:21.221
Yeah, no expression whatsoever.
Good choice.

15:21.288 --> 15:24.124
Okay, little sis, step on up.

15:24.191 --> 15:26.726
Hey! Out of my shot,
special ed.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.461
Hey, you need to be nice.
They're just kids.

15:28.528 --> 15:31.498
They drew first blood,
not me.

15:34.401 --> 15:36.869
Guess now's not a good time
to tell you I'm pregnant.

15:37.004 --> 15:38.605
You're preggers?

15:38.671 --> 15:41.174
I'm kidding.

15:41.241 --> 15:44.844
It's not really a bad time
to talk about how many
rug rats we're gonna have.

15:44.911 --> 15:47.814
I used to think six,
but after today,
I'm not so sure.

15:47.880 --> 15:52.019
Hey, how about we just
enjoy being the two of us
for a little while?

15:52.085 --> 15:53.653
Yeah, right.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.122
Oh, that reminds me.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.689
Did you ask your sister
about taking Gracie?

15:56.756 --> 15:58.158
Yeah, no dice.

15:58.225 --> 15:59.926
- Kid's afraid of cats.
- Shoot.

16:00.027 --> 16:03.196
Do you think maybe we can
just keep her in the garage?

16:03.263 --> 16:06.099
Sorry, babe. Can't have her
anywhere in the vicinity.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.068
Tongue swells up.
I have trouble breathing.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.470
Look, once we get married,

16:10.537 --> 16:13.040
pussy's gotta go.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.942
- Little pepper?
- Little bit. Thank you.

16:16.043 --> 16:18.578
Hi, Mr. Getty, Mrs. Getty.

16:18.645 --> 16:21.048
- Hi.
- David.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.216
By the way,
if you need me to pick up Skye

16:23.283 --> 16:26.953
from the airport next week,
I'm happy to do it.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.488
We got it covered.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.057
Okay, cool.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.758
Well, I'll see you later.

16:34.761 --> 16:37.164
So much for
her little fling with him

16:37.230 --> 16:39.666
being over by the summer.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.201
Don't worry.
Eat your lunch.

16:41.268 --> 16:44.337
**

17:02.355 --> 17:05.658
Now, this is what I call
a target-rich environment.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.760
- Now's your chance.
- For what?

17:07.827 --> 17:11.131
- To be my wingman.
- What is this thing "wingman"
you keep talking about?

17:11.198 --> 17:13.333
- You've seen "Top Gun," right?
- No, not yet.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.935
You must. Siskel and Ebert
were divided on it, of course,

17:16.002 --> 17:19.106
but I found it to be quite
a profound meditation

17:19.106 --> 17:20.273
on the subject
of male friendship.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.409
Tom Skerritt is electric
as always.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.144
You gonna tell me
what a wingman does?

17:24.211 --> 17:26.113
All you have to do
is fly over there.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.447
I'll watch your tail.

17:27.514 --> 17:29.749
And trap me up
to those young bogeys.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.123
Wait here.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.226
Godspeed.

17:41.027 --> 17:43.130
- This party blows.
- Hey.

17:43.196 --> 17:46.499
My friend over there was
wondering if you wanted
to party with him.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.501
- Which one?
- The one with the beard.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.437
He's been going through
a kind of a tough time lately,

17:50.503 --> 17:52.239
but he's a great guy
and a lot of fun.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.341
- Does he have any weed?
- Probably.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.843
- Okay, whatever.
- Awesome.

18:00.947 --> 18:03.283
Do you--
Do you have any weed?

18:03.350 --> 18:05.552
Marijuana? Yes, I could
definitely procure

18:05.618 --> 18:07.787
something of that sort
for you if you'd like.

18:12.259 --> 18:26.973
Hand me one of those?

18:27.039 --> 18:30.177
Surprise.

18:34.046 --> 18:35.915
- When did you--
- Two hours ago.

18:35.982 --> 18:38.050
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming home early?

18:38.185 --> 18:40.620
I wanted to see the look
on your face.

18:40.687 --> 18:43.390
It was totally worth it.
You should have seen yourself.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.196
- Do you wanna get out of here?
- Yeah.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.901
Tonight, instead of
practicing on each other,

18:54.967 --> 18:59.406
you're gonna get the chance
to clean the teeth of real
life volunteers.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.474
recruited from the community.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.843
So let's be
professional, courteous,

19:03.910 --> 19:06.779
and above all, gentle,

19:06.846 --> 19:09.649
so our volunteers can have
a pleasant experience.

19:11.017 --> 19:12.018
All right.

19:12.084 --> 19:14.621
Right this way.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.724
- What are you doing here?
- There you go.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.826
- We need to talk.
- Can't it wait?

19:19.892 --> 19:21.494
No.

19:21.561 --> 19:23.396
Tonight's worth
like 40% of my grade.

19:23.463 --> 19:25.064
Is there a problem here?

19:25.131 --> 19:27.367
No, I-- No problem, Doctor,
just--

19:27.434 --> 19:29.769
Okay. Let's not leave
our patients waiting.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.275
Wheeler, I swear to God.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.710
Sometimes I just don't know
about you.

19:37.777 --> 19:39.279
That's why I'm here.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.914
- I need to know how you feel.
- Rinse.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.418
Spit.

19:49.055 --> 19:50.323
How I feel about what?

19:50.390 --> 19:53.426
- Me.
- What? Are you high?

19:53.493 --> 19:55.928
No. But I'd take some nitrous
if you got any.

19:58.064 --> 19:59.999
Open.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.604
Ahh.

20:04.671 --> 20:07.274
Cripes, Wheeler,
how much coffee do you drink?

20:07.340 --> 20:09.776
- Ooh! Ooh! Sorry!
- I can't take it anymore.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.478
- Did I hurt you?
- Not that.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.146
- Us.
- What do you mean?

20:14.213 --> 20:17.584
I can't take not knowing
what's going on between
us, Misty.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.319
I mean,
we hang out all the time.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.454
You're over so my house
so much, my nana thinks
you're her niece.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.222
- Huh?
- We've slept
in the same bed together.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.992
- I've seen you pee.
- You-- Shh!

20:26.058 --> 20:27.627
You let me feel you up.

20:27.694 --> 20:28.928
One time.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.930
And it was awesome.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.265
You were high.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.470
Don't you feel
anything for me?

20:37.537 --> 20:39.439
Wheeler, you know I love you.

20:39.506 --> 20:40.873
You're my best friend.

20:40.940 --> 20:46.546
But I gotta look out
for myself, you know?

20:46.613 --> 20:48.615
I can't build a future
with a guy who's happy just

20:48.681 --> 20:50.383
tending bar and selling weed.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.656
I'm sorry.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.730
**

21:06.933 --> 21:08.568
You should have brought
your dad's Mercedes.

21:08.635 --> 21:10.337
Does this seat go back
any farther?

21:10.337 --> 21:11.638
No.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.906
After this, your dorm
is gonna seem palatial.

21:13.973 --> 21:16.242
- God, your hard.
- That's the gearshift.

21:16.343 --> 21:17.444
Oh.

21:17.510 --> 21:18.978
- You wanna-- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:21.781 --> 21:25.685
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What is that?

21:25.752 --> 21:27.687
French women don't shave
their armpits.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.422
Wow. You really
have gone native.

21:29.489 --> 21:32.224
- Don't make fun.
- Just to warn you,
I'm a little out of practice.

21:32.359 --> 21:35.194
- Not me.
- What? Who have you
been practicing with?

21:35.261 --> 21:36.729
Myself.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.998
Oh, well, in that case,
I'm an expert.

21:46.038 --> 21:49.876
Your cardiologist know
you're eating like that, Herb?

21:49.942 --> 21:52.211
He died... jogging.

21:52.278 --> 21:53.880
Putz.

21:53.946 --> 21:55.915
All right. Well, listen,
I wanna welcome everybody back

21:55.982 --> 21:59.018
to the beginning
of our summer season,

21:59.085 --> 22:00.653
our first board meeting,

22:00.720 --> 22:03.690
and I want to extend a special
welcome to Rebecca Horowitz,

22:03.756 --> 22:06.526
who will be serving out
her late husband Dan's
term on the board.

22:06.593 --> 22:09.261
Dan was one in a million.
He had a great sense of humor

22:09.396 --> 22:11.564
and a lousy serve,
which I'll miss 'em both.

22:11.631 --> 22:12.932
All right, why don't we
get down to business?

22:12.999 --> 22:14.801
I'm sure you all notice
the improvements

22:14.867 --> 22:16.803
we had done over the winter
at the main entrance.

22:16.869 --> 22:18.471
And next up,
we should be looking ahead

22:18.538 --> 22:20.039
to the shuffleboard courts.

22:20.106 --> 22:21.674
We have repairs needed there.

22:21.741 --> 22:23.843
The estimates are coming in
a little high.

22:23.910 --> 22:26.045
- Excuse me, Doug?
- Yeah.

22:26.112 --> 22:27.980
Before we go any further,
I believe there is

22:28.047 --> 22:30.249
a pressing matter
we need to discuss.

22:30.316 --> 22:32.452
Okay.

22:32.519 --> 22:35.788
The board feels that,
due to your legal troubles,

22:35.855 --> 22:38.891
and the negative publicity
surrounding your upcoming
criminal trial,

22:38.958 --> 22:41.428
it would be best
if you stepped down
as president.

22:41.428 --> 22:44.831
Are you kidding?

22:46.499 --> 22:50.069
Is this some kind of joke? No!

22:50.136 --> 22:52.171
Pardon me?

22:52.238 --> 22:53.640
I'm not stepping down.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.775
I helped build this place.

22:55.842 --> 22:59.712
I have been here since day one.

22:59.779 --> 23:01.781
My daughter was bat mitzvahed
here, for God's sake.

23:01.848 --> 23:03.716
Well, then I'm afraid
you leave us no choice

23:03.783 --> 23:05.117
but to hold a recall election,

23:05.184 --> 23:08.455
open to vote
by the general membership.

23:11.524 --> 23:15.061
Okay, okay.

23:15.127 --> 23:17.797
Good luck finding somebody
to run against me.

23:41.488 --> 23:43.856
I'm sorry, Mr. Myers.

23:43.923 --> 23:47.126
I'm afraid we don't have space
for you in our film program.

23:51.898 --> 23:55.735
But I applied and was accepted
to the program last year.

23:55.802 --> 23:59.806
And when you dropped out,
I'm afraid we offered your
slot to another student.

23:59.872 --> 24:03.810
I wasn't dropping out.
I was taking a break,
you know, a leave of absence.

24:03.876 --> 24:07.146
As you know, the film program
is very competitive.

24:09.682 --> 24:12.051
Well, isn't there
anything you could do?

24:12.118 --> 24:13.720
I'm sorry.

24:20.927 --> 24:22.995
**

24:25.264 --> 24:26.766
Hey--

24:41.113 --> 24:42.782
What's wrong?

24:50.456 --> 24:52.458
* I don't like the film *

24:52.559 --> 24:55.294
* I don't like the film *

24:55.361 --> 24:57.564
* Play it all back *

24:57.564 --> 24:59.966
* Play it all back *

25:00.032 --> 25:02.334
* And I don't like
the scenery *

25:02.401 --> 25:04.436
* And I don't like the set *

25:04.571 --> 25:07.574
* So put it all down *

25:07.640 --> 25:09.809
* Put it all down *

25:09.876 --> 25:12.411
* But I like the actors *

25:12.478 --> 25:14.614
* And I like the *

26:00.627 --> 26:02.795
* We're so exposed *

26:02.862 --> 26:05.632
* We're so exposed *

26:05.632 --> 26:07.634
* Anything can happen *

26:07.634 --> 26:09.769
* Anything can happen *
