WEBVTT

00:04.939 --> 00:06.455
Previously on E. R.

00:06.456 --> 00:07.646
What are you doing?

00:07.647 --> 00:11.321
I think the grease from the meat dripped
on the coals and caught on fire.

00:11.356 --> 00:14.229
- Yeah, that's what the water's bottle's for.
- You didn't tell me that.

00:14.230 --> 00:19.981
And I'm not going to be doing my dying in your
cramped, thin-walled second floor walkup.

00:21.788 --> 00:24.739
If anybody starts asking questions,
don't expect me to lie for you.

00:24.740 --> 00:26.540
Is there anything else you wanna tell me, Carter?

00:26.575 --> 00:27.952
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.

00:27.953 --> 00:30.915
Then you're suspended.
Sign out the patients and go home.

00:31.369 --> 00:33.928
- Robert, let's not-
- Right now, Kerry. Right now.

00:36.310 --> 00:39.014
E. R. 6x18 "MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN"

00:42.607 --> 00:44.730
Luka! What is that,
Croatian for "lucky"?

00:44.942 --> 00:46.271
No, Luke.

00:46.444 --> 00:48.021
- You sure?
- Yeah.

00:48.195 --> 00:52.275
- What's the matter? You're dragging.
- I worked four shifts in three days.

00:52.491 --> 00:56.903
We are 200 charts behind in coding.
I haven't done one QA.

00:57.078 --> 01:01.206
Pull yourself together. Prove your mettle
and I'll anoint you temporary chief.

01:01.415 --> 01:05.827
Or not. There's a hole in the schedule.
I gave you the midnight shift.

01:06.044 --> 01:08.286
- Tonight?
- Or tomorrow morning.

01:08.505 --> 01:11.209
- I'm not doing this.
- Luka, listen to me.

01:11.382 --> 01:14.087
This is important.
No truer words have ever been spoken.

01:14.260 --> 01:17.545
The last four letters in "American"
are "I can."

01:18.138 --> 01:19.549
Put it another way.

01:19.764 --> 01:22.967
Cover this and I'll owe you.
Don't, and you're fired.

01:23.184 --> 01:26.138
- When is Kerry coming back?
- Who says she is?

01:27.813 --> 01:31.098
- I'm running across the street-
- Get me a doughnut?

01:31.275 --> 01:34.857
Sixteen-year-old driver, MVA,
crashed into a guardrail.

01:35.070 --> 01:36.612
- Need help?
- I've got it.

01:36.779 --> 01:38.653
- And the car?
- It's still there.

01:38.865 --> 01:40.773
- They'll take it away, right?
- We'll see.

01:40.950 --> 01:45.029
BP is 130/85. Pulse 110.
Complains of abdominal pain.

01:46.204 --> 01:47.912
- Do you have neck pain?
- No.

01:48.123 --> 01:50.448
I'll take this off. Don't move.

01:50.667 --> 01:53.620
I've had my license two weeks.
This is the first time he let me drive it.

01:53.794 --> 01:55.122
- Any pain here?
- No.

01:55.296 --> 01:57.418
- Look at me. Look at the nurse.
- I'm okay.

01:57.589 --> 01:59.997
- Can I use the phone?
- Soon as the doctor's done.

02:00.175 --> 02:04.006
Neck is clear. Roll away from me.
We'll get you off this board.

02:04.220 --> 02:07.304
- Pulse ox 99.
- Did the airbag deploy?

02:07.473 --> 02:10.142
It's a '65 Mustang,
no airbag, just has a seat belt.

02:10.309 --> 02:12.597
- No shoulder strap?
- No. He'll kill me.

02:12.811 --> 02:15.847
I'm sure your father
is more concerned about you.

02:16.064 --> 02:20.974
- You don't know my father.
- Chest is clear. Does this hurt?

02:21.152 --> 02:24.187
- Here?
- I think the belt caught me there.

02:24.404 --> 02:28.781
It's a good thing you were wearing it.
CBC, chest x-ray...

02:28.992 --> 02:31.862
...abdominal CT
and a surgical consult.

02:32.078 --> 02:34.948
- Hit the brakes. I can't believe this.
- Insurance will pay.

02:35.164 --> 02:37.999
- They can't fix a classic.
- They can.

02:38.834 --> 02:42.997
Eli, look at me.
We call them accidents for a reason.

02:43.171 --> 02:45.922
You might think this is a big deal,
but it'll be okay.

02:46.132 --> 02:47.507
Really.

02:49.259 --> 02:52.509
Can I get some extra napkins
and more water, please?

02:53.221 --> 02:57.053
- Morning, ladies.
- No offense, but you look like hell.

02:57.266 --> 03:00.053
If you haven't noticed, we're short.

03:00.269 --> 03:03.186
- Yeah, it's been pretty quiet.
- For you maybe.

03:03.355 --> 03:07.020
- Come on, Kate. You gotta finish.
- So you got them into daycare?

03:07.567 --> 03:10.521
Yeah. They usually
don't take them this early.

03:10.695 --> 03:12.853
They're just advanced
for their age.

03:13.030 --> 03:17.158
I couldn't afford a nanny anymore.
Sweetie? A couple bites.

03:17.367 --> 03:19.407
- I don't blame her.
- What?

03:19.578 --> 03:21.985
- What is that?
- Rice cereal. She likes it.

03:22.205 --> 03:25.905
- Yeah, I can see.
- She's mad because I fed Tess first.

03:26.167 --> 03:29.582
- Come on, Kate, we're gonna be late.
- Here, let me try.

03:29.795 --> 03:32.416
Good luck.
This one's gonna give me gray hair.

03:32.631 --> 03:35.121
- Just wait till she's 14.
- Oh, yeah.

03:35.341 --> 03:38.377
- Oh, how gorgeous!
- Oh, thank you.

03:38.594 --> 03:40.053
- Girls?
- Yeah.

03:40.262 --> 03:43.049
Oh, they look like angels.

03:43.265 --> 03:45.388
Yeah, looks can be deceiving.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.262
I don't believe that. No, I don't.

03:49.479 --> 03:55.433
You don't give your mommy and daddy
any trouble, do you? Beautiful family.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:51.450 --> 04:53.775
- Yes, it is. Aidan, please.
- Quit it.

04:53.952 --> 04:56.739
- He pushed me.
- Wyatt, stop. Wyatt!

04:56.954 --> 04:59.706
Wait. Are these all your children?

04:59.915 --> 05:01.374
- Yes.
- No wonder you collapsed.

05:01.542 --> 05:04.542
BP's a little low at 95/70,
tachy at 120.

05:04.753 --> 05:08.584
- Wyatt, come here!
- A candy bar's stuck. I can get it.

05:08.756 --> 05:10.583
- Come here.
- Babysitting?

05:10.758 --> 05:13.379
LOC at a grocery store.
Couldn't leave them.

05:13.928 --> 05:15.303
Here, try this.

05:15.512 --> 05:17.339
- Say thank you, Wyatt.
- Thanks.

05:17.514 --> 05:21.463
- You're welcome. Where we going?
- Exam 2. Abrasion to the temple.

05:21.684 --> 05:24.092
- I think I hit my head on a shelf.
- Mommy, mommy.

05:24.312 --> 05:26.185
- Have you fainted before?
- No.

05:26.397 --> 05:31.023
- I was feeling dizzy. I'm just tired.
- She vomited and has double vision.

05:31.234 --> 05:32.776
Mouth and lips are dry.

05:32.986 --> 05:36.022
- Is that bad?
- Probably just dehydration.

05:37.281 --> 05:41.610
- I think his diaper's leaking.
- I'm sorry. He pulls at it sometimes.

05:41.785 --> 05:44.241
- I got two.
- You have to share.

05:44.454 --> 05:46.826
- These are mine.
- Share it with him.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.412
Your dad's nurse is on the phone.

05:49.625 --> 05:52.081
- Okay. You got this?
- I think so.

05:52.294 --> 05:54.038
- Here. You wanna get down?
- Yeah.

05:54.213 --> 05:58.376
- Tech support was gonna fix this.
- I paged them twice.

05:58.592 --> 06:00.501
- Which line?
- Two.

06:00.718 --> 06:04.585
- I can't get labs.
- Usually Dr. Weaver yells at them.

06:04.805 --> 06:06.714
Don't worry about what he says.

06:06.932 --> 06:09.174
Mark, do you know where
the extra T-sheets are?

06:09.351 --> 06:11.723
There's no abdominal pain
or shortness of breath.

06:11.895 --> 06:13.223
It's Kerry's system.

06:13.396 --> 06:19.019
- How long's the suspension gonna last?
- Grab a general adult form.

06:19.193 --> 06:21.766
Listen, I understand that, of course.

06:21.987 --> 06:25.153
No one is questioning
your qualifications.

06:25.323 --> 06:27.648
He is? Let me speak to him.

06:27.826 --> 06:30.696
- Call for surgical consult?
- Trauma Two.

06:30.912 --> 06:35.952
Tell him I wanna speak to him.
Tell him that I said to knock it off.

06:36.416 --> 06:39.785
I'm sorry, Mrs. Fredriksson.
Just bear with me, okay?

06:40.003 --> 06:44.498
I'll be home tonight and we'll
straighten this out. Thank you.

06:44.674 --> 06:46.333
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, fine.

06:46.509 --> 06:51.384
- We're out of the general forms.
- Go back to the old charts.

06:51.596 --> 06:55.012
Do we have a forwarding
address for Lucy?

06:55.183 --> 06:58.100
- She got something?
- The Matching Program.

06:58.311 --> 07:00.350
They forgot to pull her application.

07:00.562 --> 07:03.598
Yeah, so some hospital thinks
she'll work for them next year.

07:03.815 --> 07:06.686
- Call them.
- Should we send it to her mom?

07:06.860 --> 07:09.646
- I don't know.
- What should I do with it?

07:09.821 --> 07:12.146
- I'll take care of it.
- Carter, are you sure-?

07:12.364 --> 07:14.855
- No, I got it.
- All right.

07:21.331 --> 07:22.659
He's so cute.

07:22.832 --> 07:25.667
- I can do that. You don't have to.
- It's not a problem.

07:25.876 --> 07:29.327
I feel a lot better already.
Ian, put that down.

07:29.546 --> 07:34.706
- Come here, please. I said, come here.
- Four kids under 8. That's ambitious.

07:34.926 --> 07:36.965
Five, the baby's home.

07:37.136 --> 07:40.256
I asked you to please stop, didn't I?
Stop that.

07:40.472 --> 07:44.683
You're just exhausted.
But we're still gonna do a head CT.

07:44.851 --> 07:48.302
- That's enough.
- And I'm giving you some saline.

07:48.521 --> 07:51.605
- What's a CT?
- It's a picture of your brain.

07:51.816 --> 07:55.184
A volunteer down in Pedes
agreed to watch the kids.

07:55.402 --> 07:57.691
- I don't wanna be any trouble.
- It's no trouble.

07:57.863 --> 07:59.191
You kids wanna go play?

07:59.406 --> 08:01.813
- No.
- We've got Nintendo.

08:02.033 --> 08:03.361
"Super Smash Bros. "?

08:03.576 --> 08:06.742
I don't know.
They got something with a gorilla.

08:06.954 --> 08:09.705
- Wyatt, hold Emily's hand.
- Okay.

08:09.915 --> 08:11.706
- Follow your brother.
- Bye.

08:11.917 --> 08:14.288
Okay, guitar. I need the guitar.

08:14.502 --> 08:18.630
- Thank you.
- We're gonna have a lot of fun.

08:20.257 --> 08:22.546
Okay, here you go.

08:23.343 --> 08:24.921
Let's go.

08:26.513 --> 08:30.012
- How do you do it?
- One day at a time.

08:30.183 --> 08:32.969
- Good bowel sounds. Any nausea?
- No.

08:33.686 --> 08:37.268
- There's no guarding or rebound.
- There was before.

08:37.438 --> 08:38.933
Eli, what happened?

08:39.482 --> 08:41.190
- I had an accident.
- With the car?

08:41.400 --> 08:43.393
- I lost control-
- How fast were you going?

08:43.568 --> 08:45.941
- I don't know!
- It's okay. Don't worry about it.

08:46.155 --> 08:47.697
- The car is bad.
- No big deal.

08:48.365 --> 08:51.200
- I'm Dr. Finch.
- What's wrong with him?

08:51.409 --> 08:55.027
We may need to perform exploratory
surgery to rule out internal injury.

08:55.246 --> 08:57.369
- Oh, God...
- That's not necessary.

08:57.581 --> 09:00.072
- You don't know?
- We'll observe him.

09:00.292 --> 09:03.044
Let's keep him NPO
and check his CBC every six hours.

09:03.253 --> 09:06.419
- Sure. You have a minute?
- Yep.

09:08.174 --> 09:10.925
I'll do whatever it takes to replace it.
I promise.

09:11.135 --> 09:14.420
I don't care about the car.
I can get another.

09:15.681 --> 09:19.927
- He has a lap belt injury.
- Let's wait on the CT.

09:20.143 --> 09:24.389
CT is only 20 percent sensitive.
You should explore him.

09:24.605 --> 09:26.644
- No peritoneal signs.
- He did.

09:26.815 --> 09:30.860
You asked for a surgical opinion.
I've given you one.

09:31.069 --> 09:32.978
Let me know what the CT shows.

09:33.196 --> 09:36.031
- ICON is positive. She's pregnant.
- The woman with the kids?

09:36.240 --> 09:40.534
Yeah, eight weeks.
There's ketones in her urine.

09:40.744 --> 09:43.828
No time to eat.
I guess this wasn't planned.

09:44.039 --> 09:45.830
Maybe she wants a softball team.

09:46.041 --> 09:48.710
- She already go to CT?
- Five minutes ago.

09:48.876 --> 09:52.576
Call Radiology and talk to her
about her diet.

09:52.796 --> 09:55.334
Carol, do we have
any Materna vitamins?

09:55.549 --> 09:59.416
Try drug lockup.
Can you sign for central-line kits?

09:59.636 --> 10:01.545
- Sure. Where?
- Right there.

10:01.721 --> 10:04.675
Now sign out three cases
and put two and initial.

10:04.890 --> 10:07.381
It's a game I play.
I need two, so I ask for three.

10:07.559 --> 10:11.224
- So every time-
- Don't ask, Mark. I get what I need.

10:11.438 --> 10:12.896
Okay, whatever it takes.

10:13.106 --> 10:15.893
Thanks. Maybe I'll have you sign off
on crash carts too.

10:16.067 --> 10:17.940
Bring it on. I'm easy.

10:19.695 --> 10:23.443
Hey, Carol.
Can you give a dose of Levaquin?

10:23.657 --> 10:26.942
- Sure.
- Did the girls settle in?

10:27.118 --> 10:29.739
- They seem to like it?
- I don't know. They're babies.

10:29.954 --> 10:34.081
I'd worry about the staff.
"The Hathaway twins hit daycare. "

10:34.249 --> 10:38.199
- Ross. Their last name is Ross.
- Right.

10:39.462 --> 10:42.997
- Sorry.
- No, don't worry. They're fine.

10:43.174 --> 10:46.589
Good. Good.
And run in a liter of saline.

10:46.802 --> 10:48.510
Okay.

10:51.890 --> 10:53.763
- Mr. Simpson?
- Yes.

10:53.933 --> 10:56.887
Dr. Kovac.
You experience some chest pain?

10:57.103 --> 10:59.428
It's not really pain. It feels tight.

10:59.605 --> 11:02.226
- How long does it last?
- Few seconds.

11:02.441 --> 11:04.896
I think I'm having anxiety attacks.

11:05.110 --> 11:07.683
I can't breathe,
my heart starts pounding.

11:07.904 --> 11:10.359
- History of heart disease?
- No.

11:10.573 --> 11:14.985
- What brings it on?
- I'm going through a bad divorce.

11:15.827 --> 11:18.863
I see. Does the pain move
anywhere else?

11:19.080 --> 11:21.119
I got aches and pains all over.

11:21.290 --> 11:25.453
She gets up every morning thinking
how she can screw with me.

11:25.628 --> 11:29.956
Okay, let's get a 12-lead EKG
and draw cardiac labs.

11:30.132 --> 11:32.966
- You married, doc?
- No.

11:33.134 --> 11:37.001
Stay that way.
It's not enough she bankrupts me...

11:37.221 --> 11:40.305
- ... she's putting me in the grave.
- We'll see what we can do.

11:40.516 --> 11:42.259
Yeah.

11:42.476 --> 11:44.018
Yeah.

11:45.520 --> 11:46.848
There.

11:49.023 --> 11:50.850
Looks like a good heartbeat.

11:52.484 --> 11:57.774
By the time one gets to sleep,
another one's hungry or needs changing.

11:57.989 --> 12:01.239
Or somebody's into something
he shouldn't be.

12:01.743 --> 12:03.071
Do you have any help?

12:03.286 --> 12:07.413
My husband works a lot.
You should see our grocery bill.

12:09.291 --> 12:12.375
Well, you have to take
better care of yourself.

12:12.585 --> 12:17.496
You're malnourished.
You have to eat more and take vitamins.

12:19.550 --> 12:21.922
Did you know you were pregnant?

12:27.098 --> 12:29.304
How long have you known?

12:29.809 --> 12:31.267
I don't know.

12:35.689 --> 12:37.977
Have you told your husband?

12:38.733 --> 12:40.061
No.

12:44.530 --> 12:49.690
- And you were fasting?
- No! I don't have time to eat.

12:49.868 --> 12:54.446
You weren't starving yourself
to induce a miscarriage, were you?

12:57.041 --> 13:01.667
We both wanted a big family.
I just thought I'd get a break.

13:02.462 --> 13:04.502
Your body protects the fetus first.

13:04.714 --> 13:08.628
But you're putting your
own heart and kidneys at risk.

13:14.223 --> 13:16.215
Were you trying to terminate?

13:23.230 --> 13:25.187
There are safer ways to do that.

13:29.486 --> 13:31.727
Have you considered an abortion?

13:32.906 --> 13:36.155
I can't have another baby right now.
I just can't.

13:42.914 --> 13:46.698
- Another Webril.
- Poor guy slips, breaks his neck.

13:46.918 --> 13:50.286
This woman falls down concrete steps
and cracks her wrist.

13:50.504 --> 13:53.209
The benefits of alcohol consumption.

13:53.424 --> 13:55.332
I could do with a margarita.

13:55.550 --> 13:58.670
I don't remember the last time
I had a drink.

13:58.887 --> 14:02.754
It's the "no caffeine"
I couldn't deal with.

14:02.974 --> 14:06.805
- Thanks, Mark.
- Three-inch roll.

14:07.477 --> 14:09.351
I'm thinking of weaning them.

14:09.521 --> 14:13.055
It's been six months. I don't know
how much longer I can deal.

14:13.274 --> 14:17.437
- I can't believe you've lasted this long.
- So I'm not a terrible mother?

14:18.279 --> 14:22.442
If you planned on being
the perfect parent, fail now...

14:22.657 --> 14:24.531
...while they can't remember.

14:25.452 --> 14:27.408
Another three-inch.

14:30.122 --> 14:32.079
You okay?

14:34.001 --> 14:38.329
- They deserve a father, Mark.
- Doug's been seeing them.

14:39.964 --> 14:45.836
He asked me to move to Seattle again.
And I think he's serious this time.

14:46.762 --> 14:48.920
What did you tell him?

14:50.974 --> 14:53.974
- Do you have a second?
- Go ahead. I got this.

14:54.185 --> 14:55.893
Okay.

14:59.314 --> 15:02.730
- What's up?
- She was starving herself to miscarry.

15:02.943 --> 15:05.979
- "Supermom"?
- I may have talked her into an abortion.

15:06.195 --> 15:09.231
- She didn't ask for one?
- She's scared.

15:09.448 --> 15:11.156
Come here.

15:12.117 --> 15:16.992
- She doesn't want her husband to know.
- Refer her to the GYN clinic.

15:17.205 --> 15:21.665
I offered to arrange things
for her upstairs. Today.

15:21.834 --> 15:25.831
- What's the rush?
- This might be her only opportunity.

15:26.004 --> 15:30.215
- She can't get out of the house?
- She needed me to make it happen.

15:30.425 --> 15:33.461
She's not in a state
to make her own decision?

15:33.845 --> 15:38.008
- No, she just needed a push.
- And you pushed her?

15:39.683 --> 15:42.553
- I don't know.
- Did you give her options?

15:42.727 --> 15:47.768
Yes. The husband won't let her adopt
out. It's gonna push her over the edge.

15:47.982 --> 15:50.733
If she's gone to this much trouble
to avoid an abortion...

15:50.901 --> 15:53.937
...there's a part of her
that has a problem with it.

15:54.863 --> 15:56.274
Or her husband does.

15:57.282 --> 16:00.366
- Can GYN even do it?
- I haven't asked them.

16:00.535 --> 16:03.452
All right. Talk to them.
It might not even be possible.

16:05.039 --> 16:10.459
- Thank you.
- Be careful, Abby. Make sure.

16:14.505 --> 16:19.167
- Your surgical consult is here.
- And who might that be?

16:19.384 --> 16:23.880
- How about a clue?
- Dr. Romano?

16:24.097 --> 16:26.504
Okay. See?

16:27.100 --> 16:29.175
Need a doctor to take a look?

16:38.067 --> 16:41.187
Don't worry about me.
I'm getting some Lasix.

16:43.155 --> 16:46.275
- Belt injury?
- CT is clear. But he's guarding.

16:46.492 --> 16:50.571
You know, just discussing a patient.

16:50.787 --> 16:52.578
I could use a discussion.

16:52.789 --> 16:56.240
- Maybe I should see the patient.
- Good idea.

16:58.961 --> 17:03.918
Eli, Mr. Emerson, this is Dr. Benton.
He's a surgeon.

17:04.089 --> 17:06.415
- How's your belly?
- A little sore.

17:06.634 --> 17:09.385
- Does this hurt?
- Only when you press hard.

17:09.595 --> 17:11.006
- Any back pain?
- No.

17:11.221 --> 17:14.507
- His white count is up.
- Was the other surgeon wrong?

17:15.224 --> 17:17.632
- What other surgeon?
- Dr. Corday.

17:17.810 --> 17:20.051
Could you give us a second?

17:23.816 --> 17:27.598
- Elizabeth saw him?
- I didn't get a chance to tell you.

17:27.819 --> 17:31.484
I disagreed with her.
I wanted a second opinion.

17:31.656 --> 17:35.025
His belly is fairly benign.
No back or flank pain.

17:35.242 --> 17:38.693
- He could have a bowel leak.
- There's no fever.

17:39.830 --> 17:43.827
Delay can raise mortality
from five to 65 percent.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.242
Okay. I'll do an ex-lap, okay?

17:47.336 --> 17:49.080
Thank you, Peter.

17:49.755 --> 17:54.167
- One, two, three.
- Oh, God! Watch my back, would you?

17:54.342 --> 17:56.134
How far did you fall?

17:56.344 --> 17:59.013
- Six, eight feet.
- Coworkers said four.

17:59.222 --> 18:03.219
Four, my ass! I felt a pop.
I think I blew out a disk.

18:03.434 --> 18:05.675
Complains of leg weakness, LOC.

18:05.894 --> 18:08.599
I passed out. Everything went black.

18:08.813 --> 18:11.269
BP's 110/70. Pulse 81.

18:11.482 --> 18:13.142
- Is that bad?
- That's normal.

18:13.359 --> 18:15.648
Press on my hands with your feet.

18:17.655 --> 18:19.197
Jeez!

18:19.406 --> 18:21.648
- That hurt?
- Yeah! What do you think?

18:23.368 --> 18:26.534
Does your employer cover
on-the-job injury?

18:26.704 --> 18:29.574
- He better.
- I'm gonna press down.

18:29.790 --> 18:33.040
Tell me if it increases
the pain in your back.

18:33.210 --> 18:36.246
- Oh, stop, stop!
- Pain is MU.

18:36.463 --> 18:39.878
- What's that?
- We're gonna check it all out.

18:41.050 --> 18:44.004
Better get a CBC
and a lumbar-spine series.

18:44.219 --> 18:46.757
- What exactly is MU?
- Made-up.

18:46.972 --> 18:49.297
- You think he's faking?
- Oh, yeah.

18:50.683 --> 18:54.017
Hey. So is it anxiety attacks?

18:54.228 --> 18:57.561
I'm not sure.
But your cardiac enzymes are normal.

18:57.773 --> 19:00.311
And I'm not seeing
irregularities on the EKG.

19:01.526 --> 19:05.476
- I didn't think it was my heart.
- You might be stressed.

19:05.655 --> 19:07.398
I could've told you that.

19:07.573 --> 19:10.360
I still need to monitor you
for six hours to eight hours.

19:10.826 --> 19:12.450
You said everything was okay.

19:12.619 --> 19:15.573
Heart damage may not
show up right away.

19:15.747 --> 19:18.783
The way you came in,
I wanna make sure.

19:19.584 --> 19:22.750
I just got myself all worked up.

19:23.170 --> 19:25.661
You see, she's...

19:25.881 --> 19:28.253
She's driving me crazy.

19:28.425 --> 19:31.959
I never wanted a divorce.

19:34.096 --> 19:38.176
- Hell...
- Mr. Simpson. Mr. Simpson.

19:38.350 --> 19:42.430
Every time. I'm sorry.
It just hits me.

19:42.604 --> 19:46.222
I don't know what I'm doing.
I'm sorry.

19:46.441 --> 19:50.105
- No, don't worry. It's okay.
- Every day...

19:50.277 --> 19:54.820
Every day another damn letter
or phone call from her lawyer.

19:56.074 --> 19:58.315
More threats, more demands.

20:02.955 --> 20:07.616
I don't know what I did wrong.
I love my son.

20:08.585 --> 20:10.743
I loved her, I still do.

20:12.296 --> 20:13.874
I understand.

20:16.967 --> 20:18.592
I'm sorry.

20:19.469 --> 20:21.675
It's not your problem.

20:22.639 --> 20:27.051
Maybe I can get a clinical
psychologist to talk to you.

20:27.268 --> 20:29.593
Clinical psychologist?

20:30.604 --> 20:33.558
That worse than the ordinary kind?

20:36.317 --> 20:37.646
Hi.

20:38.111 --> 20:41.230
I checked on your kids.
They're having a great time.

20:41.447 --> 20:42.645
They need to eat.

20:42.865 --> 20:47.692
They're eating now.
Kids don't complain about hospital food.

20:52.582 --> 20:54.539
You sure this is what you want?

20:55.167 --> 20:59.034
No, it's not what I want.
It's what I need.

21:00.297 --> 21:02.834
Okay. I worked it out with GYN.

21:03.007 --> 21:06.376
There's a doctor who can
squeeze you in now.

21:07.970 --> 21:10.342
Take me up before I change my mind.

21:11.181 --> 21:14.052
Yeah. Well, the thing is...

21:14.351 --> 21:17.684
...I'd hate for you to change
your mind later on.

21:18.229 --> 21:19.688
No, I know.

21:20.022 --> 21:23.023
I meant... Forget it.

21:23.192 --> 21:24.437
No, tell me.

21:27.863 --> 21:32.524
I feel like such a hypocrite.
I know that this is so wrong.

21:32.742 --> 21:36.276
I keep telling myself I'm doing
this for my family.

21:37.871 --> 21:39.994
Maybe you better take more time.

21:41.041 --> 21:44.623
My husband is a good man
but he'd never understand.

21:46.796 --> 21:51.623
It's better if he doesn't know.
Let's just get it over with.

21:54.052 --> 21:55.380
Okay.

21:55.929 --> 21:57.672
Thank you.

21:59.807 --> 22:01.515
This isn't easy to do alone.

22:02.560 --> 22:06.058
An hour of continuous nebs
should do it.

22:06.271 --> 22:08.596
- It's that nurse.
- Now what?

22:08.815 --> 22:11.769
- Your dad made racial slurs.
- She's Swedish.

22:11.984 --> 22:16.278
- Maybe he called her a meatball.
- Say I'm on my way.

22:16.488 --> 22:20.023
I put the shoulder back in.
Check the films.

22:20.242 --> 22:22.448
- Does he have an orthopedist?
- Give it to Ortho.

22:22.660 --> 22:24.902
- You leaving?
- I've been on since 5:30.

22:25.079 --> 22:27.404
Can you take Exam 6?

22:27.623 --> 22:29.283
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

22:29.500 --> 22:32.417
- Pull these.
- You have a critical value.

22:32.628 --> 22:35.083
White count's 150,000: leukemia.

22:35.255 --> 22:36.417
- Who?
- Fazio.

22:36.631 --> 22:38.873
- Workers' comp guy?
- What?

22:39.091 --> 22:42.258
He fell off a ladder.
Look, 95% blasts.

22:42.469 --> 22:44.676
- Get a Hema-Onc consult.
- Where's Carol?

22:44.888 --> 22:45.967
- Upstairs.
- Again?

22:46.181 --> 22:47.924
- She's on break.
- Again?

22:48.099 --> 22:51.302
- Are you a hall monitor?
- I need an NG tube.

22:51.519 --> 22:53.677
- So do it.
- You let this go on?

22:53.896 --> 22:56.138
- Let her be.
- The chief wouldn't.

22:56.357 --> 22:58.894
You try raising two children.

22:59.109 --> 23:00.603
Why should I suffer?

23:00.777 --> 23:03.564
- Quit whining. I'll do it.
- Thanks.

23:04.739 --> 23:06.815
- Where's my MVA?
- Cleo's?

23:07.033 --> 23:08.740
- Yes.
- Benton took him.

23:08.951 --> 23:10.659
- Benton?
- Yeah.

23:14.831 --> 23:16.954
Hey. How are you feeling?

23:17.125 --> 23:20.624
Something's wrong.
I'm having back spasms.

23:20.795 --> 23:23.083
The x-ray shows no fractures.

23:23.255 --> 23:27.299
- But I still have pain.
- I'm sure you do.

23:27.509 --> 23:31.838
- I can't work like this.
- You're not going to work.

23:32.054 --> 23:33.762
Yeah? For how long?

23:35.057 --> 23:37.808
You have acute
myelogenous leukemia.

23:38.727 --> 23:41.728
Leukemia? You mean like the cancer?

23:42.063 --> 23:47.401
- Yes. And it can cause bone pain.
- Come on. Get out of here!

23:47.568 --> 23:50.106
- I fell down!
- It's in your blood.

23:50.320 --> 23:53.107
Hematology will admit you...

23:53.281 --> 23:55.772
- ... and start chemo.
- Wait a second.

23:56.284 --> 23:58.442
- I'm sorry.
- We need you now.

23:58.661 --> 24:00.072
- I'll be back.
- Doc!

24:00.246 --> 24:01.704
I'll be right back.

24:03.999 --> 24:06.406
- Push. 2 epi.
- What is it?

24:06.626 --> 24:10.540
- Ten-year-old in shock.
- No response to albuterol.

24:10.755 --> 24:14.206
- Allergies?
- Peanuts. Pressure's dropping.

24:14.425 --> 24:16.631
Draw 75 ketamine, 75 sux.

24:16.802 --> 24:19.838
- Pulse ox 82.
- Start rapid induction.

24:20.055 --> 24:21.383
No, I've got it.

24:21.556 --> 24:22.884
BP is 60 palp.

24:26.852 --> 24:29.141
- Come on. Let's go.
- Hold on.

24:29.772 --> 24:33.520
- You want cricoid pressure?
- I can't pass it.

24:33.733 --> 24:38.027
Set up for fiber-optic intubation.
50 mg of Solu-Medrol.

24:38.237 --> 24:39.945
- Okay, out of the way.
- I've got it.

24:40.156 --> 24:41.863
- You've done one?
- Two.

24:46.328 --> 24:50.325
- Keep gentle tension.
- I know. I'm feeding it in.

24:50.540 --> 24:53.908
- There's the epiglottis.
- What are you doing?

24:54.085 --> 24:56.291
- Keep going.
- I can't see.

24:56.462 --> 24:58.371
- Pulse ox 78.
- Bag her.

24:58.547 --> 25:01.084
- I just need to-
- I said, get out.

25:01.299 --> 25:04.834
- What? I almost had it.
- I'm taking over.

25:05.011 --> 25:06.339
John!

25:06.512 --> 25:09.596
- Up to 82.
- All right. Let's go again.

25:13.393 --> 25:17.889
- Thank you. He'll be better tomorrow.
- He couldn't be worse.

25:18.064 --> 25:20.056
Is she gone?

25:22.651 --> 25:24.809
Yeah, okay? She's gone.

25:24.987 --> 25:27.738
- We'll be lucky if she returns.
- Says you.

25:27.906 --> 25:30.823
We need her.
Someone has to be here.

25:31.034 --> 25:33.405
Not if I went to the hospice.

25:33.577 --> 25:36.282
You'd be surrounded by strangers.

25:36.497 --> 25:38.904
No stranger than Nurse Von Bülow.

25:39.082 --> 25:43.494
And look at this room.
It's like a damn hospital!

25:43.711 --> 25:46.831
- How much is this costing?
- Don't worry.

25:47.048 --> 25:50.796
- What the hell is that?
- A portable toilet.

25:50.968 --> 25:56.044
- You got me a Johnny-on-the-spot?
- It's just for convenience.

25:56.264 --> 26:00.890
I am not taking a dump
in your living room, Mark!

26:01.101 --> 26:06.059
I am not an invalid!
I can still make it to the bathroom!

26:06.231 --> 26:09.148
Dad. Sit down. Come on, sit down.

26:09.317 --> 26:13.895
- Sit and relax.
- This is what I didn't want happening.

26:14.071 --> 26:16.313
- Relax.
- I won't use it.

26:16.532 --> 26:21.442
I'll get your albuterol, okay?
I'll take it back, all right?

26:21.661 --> 26:23.950
Here. Just take a few puffs.

26:25.164 --> 26:27.737
Nice and easy. Calm down.

26:33.088 --> 26:35.164
- Where is he?
- The suit.

26:36.090 --> 26:41.001
- Mr. Parker? I'm Abby.
- Hi. You're taking care of my wife?

26:41.220 --> 26:44.968
Yes. She was a little dehydrated
and tired.

26:45.182 --> 26:46.889
She came by ambulance.

26:47.100 --> 26:50.718
It's standard when patients
lose consciousness.

26:51.145 --> 26:52.473
- God.
- It's okay.

26:52.688 --> 26:55.357
Mostly, she just needs to rest.

26:56.191 --> 26:58.943
She overdoes it.
She does too much.

26:59.444 --> 27:04.236
- You should get her some help at home.
- Yeah. Can I see her?

27:05.032 --> 27:09.077
- She went upstairs for tests.
- What kind of tests?

27:09.536 --> 27:13.284
She was anemic.
We checked her heart and blood.

27:13.456 --> 27:16.825
- Let's find your kids.
- Okay.

27:17.043 --> 27:22.285
- But she only needs rest.
- She does. We're being thorough.

27:22.464 --> 27:25.334
- I should be there.
- That'd be difficult.

27:26.343 --> 27:29.343
- What's all this?
- I've got an ex-lap.

27:29.554 --> 27:34.464
- Were you going to call me?
- I didn't know I needed permission.

27:34.683 --> 27:38.016
Did your friend tell you
I'd examined the patient?

27:38.770 --> 27:43.977
- Dr. Finch advised me of your opinion.
- I bet she did.

27:44.192 --> 27:48.023
- I made my assessment.
- That boy is asymptomatic...

27:48.237 --> 27:51.985
- ... except for a bruise.
- His white count rose.

27:52.449 --> 27:56.695
- She should've called me.
- You'd made up your mind.

27:56.911 --> 27:59.117
I was observing him.

27:59.330 --> 28:03.161
She may not be as comfortable
with me as you...

28:03.333 --> 28:06.619
...but I might have changed my mind.

28:06.836 --> 28:08.461
Maybe.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.252
Stop scrubbing.

28:12.758 --> 28:15.047
- What?
- You heard me, I said stop.

28:16.220 --> 28:19.719
- I'm operating on him.
- No, you're not. I am.

28:20.640 --> 28:24.222
- I'm ready.
- Sorry to have wasted your time.

28:24.435 --> 28:27.685
It's my prerogative
to schedule cases...

28:27.896 --> 28:30.932
...especially ones I've seen first.

28:31.149 --> 28:35.894
- You mean you're pulling rank on me?
- Absolutely.

28:36.696 --> 28:38.024
- Carter?
- Yeah.

28:38.197 --> 28:41.648
Dan Shine.
You sent me a patient for a biopsy.

28:41.867 --> 28:44.109
- How'd it go?
- His bone marrow is normal.

28:45.579 --> 28:49.991
- No. He had 95% blasts.
- Someone else did. He's normal.

28:50.208 --> 28:51.239
What?

28:51.417 --> 28:56.328
They mixed up records.
Do you have a patient named Simpson?

28:58.173 --> 29:01.542
- Can you find Dr. Kovac?
- Just a second.

29:01.759 --> 29:03.799
No, now!

29:06.013 --> 29:09.595
- Did you talk to him?
- You might want to go up.

29:09.808 --> 29:12.928
I stuck him,
then told him we were wrong.

29:13.144 --> 29:16.098
That he wouldn't die.
He wants to sue.

29:16.314 --> 29:17.891
I'm sure he did.

29:18.107 --> 29:20.514
Excuse me? They took my wife up.

29:20.734 --> 29:24.814
I wanted to see if she was back.
The name's Parker.

29:26.489 --> 29:27.983
Gynecology Clinic.

29:28.199 --> 29:32.066
Wait. Gynecology Clinic?
I thought she was anemic.

29:32.286 --> 29:36.746
I didn't take care of her.
You can wait right over there.

29:36.915 --> 29:39.584
- Call me if you find Simpson.
- Yeah.

29:42.712 --> 29:45.547
- Excuse me, what's your name?
- Abby.

29:45.756 --> 29:50.583
Abby, yeah. It says "GYN"
by my wife's name. Is that right?

29:50.761 --> 29:54.094
Why don't you have a seat?
I'll check.

29:54.264 --> 29:57.549
- Is there something wrong?
- No, she's fine.

29:57.725 --> 30:01.224
Why is she in Gynecology?
Is she pregnant?

30:01.437 --> 30:02.979
You should wait.

30:03.188 --> 30:07.896
I don't want to wait anymore!
Tell me what's wrong with her.

30:08.109 --> 30:10.434
- I can't.
- Why?

30:10.611 --> 30:13.280
Medical information is private.

30:13.489 --> 30:16.110
It's my wife. What can't I know?

30:16.325 --> 30:18.862
- Mr. Parker-
- Is she having an abortion?

30:24.248 --> 30:26.656
- Is she?
- I can't say.

30:28.335 --> 30:30.126
What floor is Gynecology on?

30:31.463 --> 30:34.380
- What floor is Gynecology on?!
- Ninth.

30:39.386 --> 30:42.008
- You needed me, Carter?
- Yeah.

30:46.810 --> 30:51.471
- You're sure it's not another mistake?
- We double-checked.

30:55.317 --> 30:57.309
How long?

30:58.111 --> 31:02.607
- It's hard for me to say.
- Ballpark, best guess.

31:03.824 --> 31:05.900
With a bone-marrow transplant...

31:06.076 --> 31:09.777
...there's a 60 percent survival rate
at five years.

31:11.581 --> 31:13.621
Without one?

31:13.833 --> 31:18.293
Chemotherapy alone?
About half of that.

31:19.922 --> 31:22.839
We'll do what we can
to find a match.

31:23.008 --> 31:25.925
Type your family: brothers, sisters-

31:26.136 --> 31:27.962
I don't have any brothers or sisters.

31:29.514 --> 31:33.511
- Are your parents living?
- I have an uncle.

31:33.726 --> 31:35.350
That's good.

31:35.519 --> 31:36.847
And your son.

31:38.021 --> 31:39.764
He's only 8.

31:40.315 --> 31:42.224
Probably the best chance.

31:47.196 --> 31:49.568
I should call my wife.

31:53.618 --> 31:55.112
Yeah.

31:58.456 --> 32:02.535
- You called for a consult?
- Yeah. Abdominal pain.

32:02.751 --> 32:06.285
- A hot appy.
- Didn't bring them to the O.R. yourself?

32:06.504 --> 32:10.502
- Temp's 101.
- I just closed Eli Emerson's belly.

32:10.716 --> 32:14.251
- I thought Peter was-
- No, he was my consult.

32:14.428 --> 32:17.512
- There's no perforation.
- What a relief.

32:18.473 --> 32:22.387
- Pity I had to cut him open.
- Better to know than regret it later.

32:22.560 --> 32:23.935
Yes.

32:25.521 --> 32:28.094
You may have special access
to Peter...

32:28.315 --> 32:32.443
...but from now on,
come to me if you have a problem.

32:32.652 --> 32:35.225
Obviously you agreed with him.

32:35.446 --> 32:38.233
- "Yes, Elizabeth," will do.
- Do you want this?

32:38.908 --> 32:41.030
- Which room?
- Four.

32:43.620 --> 32:47.487
- Hey, what's going on?
- They took all my stuff.

32:47.707 --> 32:49.995
The city swept his street.

32:50.209 --> 32:55.630
- When was your last drink?
- I tried to get up on a dumpster.

32:55.797 --> 32:59.083
- They pushed me down.
- How much have you had?

32:59.300 --> 33:03.167
They took my pillows.
I had a tarp for rain.

33:03.387 --> 33:05.546
- Have you eaten?
- No money.

33:05.764 --> 33:09.133
Let's get a banana bag.
CBC and blood alcohol.

33:09.351 --> 33:11.178
- Did you hit your head?
- What?

33:11.394 --> 33:14.597
- Did you hit your head?
- Hold still, Pablo.

33:14.814 --> 33:16.273
- Let me go.
- Hold still.

33:16.482 --> 33:18.391
No.

33:18.776 --> 33:21.776
- Soft restraints.
- It's okay.

33:22.487 --> 33:26.235
- Call Security.
- It was an accident. Pablo, be still.

33:26.449 --> 33:27.777
- What's that?
- Haldol.

33:27.951 --> 33:29.943
- What? No!
- Let me go.

33:30.161 --> 33:32.367
- Carter, what are you doing?
- No. Carter.

33:33.622 --> 33:35.496
- What's wrong?
- He's violent.

33:35.707 --> 33:39.325
It was an accident.
They don't come any gentler.

33:39.544 --> 33:41.869
- Are you going to help?
- No!

33:42.088 --> 33:44.246
All right, fine.
Call me when he calms down.

33:55.850 --> 33:59.930
- You got any four-by-fours in here?
- Let me check.

34:00.145 --> 34:03.728
- Xeroform, Adaptic...
- If not, in the suture room.

34:03.940 --> 34:07.475
Hold on, I'm still looking.
Here we go.

34:10.029 --> 34:12.815
- What's going on?
- What, with Pablo?

34:13.032 --> 34:17.159
Your overreaction to Pablo.
Or am I now overreacting?

34:17.327 --> 34:21.159
I was being careful.
Maybe it was a bad call.

34:21.371 --> 34:24.041
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

34:24.500 --> 34:27.951
I know what it's like
to have life change.

34:28.170 --> 34:31.289
A year ago I was living with Doug.

34:31.505 --> 34:35.254
Now I'm living alone with two babies.
Go figure.

34:35.467 --> 34:39.216
- Yeah.
- It takes a while to deal with it...

34:39.429 --> 34:41.469
...to get used to it.

34:42.266 --> 34:45.100
You still need to get used to it.

34:47.186 --> 34:50.768
- Lucy matched.
- Oh, God. Where?

34:50.940 --> 34:54.308
Here. Got a spot in Psych.

34:55.277 --> 34:56.853
Go figure.

34:59.197 --> 35:02.151
There's always gonna be something.

35:04.952 --> 35:07.869
Well, what are you gonna do?

35:09.081 --> 35:10.954
Go back to work.

35:15.711 --> 35:18.629
- She's not really Swedish.
- What?

35:18.839 --> 35:22.919
Fredriksson. She's married to a Swede.
She's Dutch.

35:23.135 --> 35:26.883
- So you did talk to her.
- No, I didn't talk.

35:27.096 --> 35:29.421
She yapped and yapped.

35:29.640 --> 35:34.385
Finally, about halfway through
watching Rosie O 'Donnell...

35:34.603 --> 35:38.268
...I said to stick her thumb
in her dike and shut up.

35:38.481 --> 35:41.268
- You didn't.
- Sure, I did.

35:41.734 --> 35:44.307
To stick her thumb in her dike?

35:44.528 --> 35:49.237
She got what I meant.
And it worked. Not another word.

35:49.408 --> 35:52.077
- What is this?
- Meatloaf.

35:53.036 --> 35:55.906
The only recipe of Mom's
I remember.

35:56.080 --> 35:58.701
- Where's the egg?
- What egg?

35:59.583 --> 36:02.121
Your mom cooked it with an egg.

36:02.336 --> 36:04.375
You'd get a sliver per slice.

36:05.922 --> 36:07.297
I forgot.

36:12.094 --> 36:16.091
I never much liked the egg,
always ate around it.

36:19.100 --> 36:20.927
Okay.

36:27.024 --> 36:32.444
- Work was pretty decent today.
- That's good.

36:36.157 --> 36:37.781
So anything happen here?

36:39.952 --> 36:41.861
Like what?

36:42.037 --> 36:44.991
I don't know.
Maybe you and she did something.

36:45.206 --> 36:47.662
What the hell would we do?
Play Parcheesi?

36:48.709 --> 36:51.200
Dad, forget it. Okay?

36:51.420 --> 36:53.993
I was just making conversation.

36:56.424 --> 36:59.544
Yeah, okay. Whatever.

37:03.973 --> 37:06.261
Your mom served it with peas.

37:06.475 --> 37:09.048
Not with string beans.

37:10.812 --> 37:12.970
Yeah. I guess so.

37:17.860 --> 37:19.484
- Hey, Abby.
- Hey.

37:21.488 --> 37:23.112
How's she doing?

37:23.406 --> 37:27.653
- Pretty well. She's gonna be okay.
- That's good.

37:27.827 --> 37:32.619
I want to apologize.
I let my emotions get the best of me.

37:32.831 --> 37:34.409
Of course.

37:34.583 --> 37:37.156
Lynn let herself get rundown.

37:37.335 --> 37:39.375
She just got depressed.

37:40.338 --> 37:42.081
I guess I didn't see.

37:42.298 --> 37:44.670
It's easy for that to happen.

37:45.676 --> 37:49.839
She's resting now.
I'm gonna check on my kids.

37:50.055 --> 37:51.679
Sure.

38:00.189 --> 38:02.940
- Hi, how are you doing?
- I'm okay.

38:03.149 --> 38:07.692
- I saw your husband.
- He was upset, but he's better now.

38:07.904 --> 38:10.145
He forgave me.

38:11.865 --> 38:16.028
- He forgave you?
- We all make mistakes sometimes.

38:17.662 --> 38:20.497
What you did today
was a mistake?

38:21.332 --> 38:23.704
He didn't call it that.
Just a moment of weakness.

38:25.336 --> 38:30.246
- Well, what do you think?
- He talked to a doctor. I'll be fine.

38:30.465 --> 38:34.961
- We'll be able to try again soon.
- For another baby?

38:35.178 --> 38:37.882
Ken's a wonderful father.

38:38.055 --> 38:42.348
We both love kids.
We've always wanted a big family.

38:44.686 --> 38:46.678
Kids are great.

38:49.023 --> 38:52.771
- Why don't you rest, okay?
- Thanks.

39:05.662 --> 39:09.790
- Look at Kate's hat. She's so cute.
- Isn't that Tess?

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
Nope. Tess is the one eating the hat.

39:13.211 --> 39:15.618
- Hey, Luka. You off?
- No.

39:15.838 --> 39:18.543
Heading out to meet a trauma. You?

39:18.757 --> 39:22.422
- After I pick up the girls.
- Isn't that adorable?

39:22.636 --> 39:24.295
Yeah. Very beautiful.

39:25.471 --> 39:27.464
- See you.
- Bye.

39:28.266 --> 39:31.681
- Has anyone seen Benton?
- I think he crashed.

39:31.894 --> 39:34.384
- Oh, God! Dr. Kovac...
- What?

39:34.604 --> 39:38.269
- He had two children. Two, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

39:44.738 --> 39:48.818
- Hey.
- Hey. Where are the girls?

39:49.034 --> 39:53.612
I'm on my way up to get them.
How much longer are you on?

39:53.830 --> 39:57.079
If Romano has his way,
probably forever.

39:58.334 --> 40:02.117
Luka, I just realized,
looking at those pictures...

40:02.337 --> 40:05.788
I've never seen
any pictures of your children.

40:05.965 --> 40:09.416
- You want to see one?
- That'd be great.

40:19.185 --> 40:22.601
Jasna. That was her birthday party.

40:22.813 --> 40:24.142
She was 4.

40:24.815 --> 40:29.607
- She's beautiful. So is your wife.
- Yeah, she was.

40:32.280 --> 40:35.115
- Can I see your son?
- I don't have any.

40:35.741 --> 40:38.528
You don't have any now, or at all?

40:38.744 --> 40:40.452
I'm lucky to have this.

40:41.872 --> 40:43.947
No, to see Marco...

40:44.124 --> 40:48.037
...I just have to close my eyes
and he's there.

40:49.211 --> 40:53.624
Usually with chocolate ice cream
on his face and hands.

40:57.719 --> 41:02.297
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no. Thank you for asking.

41:06.018 --> 41:08.888
Oh, here I go. Back to work.

41:09.646 --> 41:11.934
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

41:21.740 --> 41:23.898
- What is it?
- It's me.

41:24.826 --> 41:26.569
Cleo.

41:27.186 --> 41:30.073
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Lie down.

41:30.247 --> 41:35.372
- I thought you were going home.
- Maybe later.

41:37.378 --> 41:39.834
This is okay for now.

42:05.445 --> 42:08.647
Dr. John. I thought the dog got in.

42:08.864 --> 42:11.022
No, it's just me, Corrine.

42:12.075 --> 42:14.151
- Couldn't sleep?
- No.

42:15.912 --> 42:19.530
- You want me to make something?
- I'm fine. Thanks.

42:20.291 --> 42:21.951
Okay.

42:22.543 --> 42:24.416
- Good night.
- Good night.

42:37.556 --> 42:38.884
Mark!

42:40.225 --> 42:41.849
Mark!

42:42.185 --> 42:44.474
- Dad?
- Mark!

42:44.729 --> 42:46.223
Just a second.

42:47.773 --> 42:52.316
- What's wrong?
- I told you this would get in the way.

42:52.486 --> 42:53.814
What happened?

42:53.987 --> 42:58.649
I was trying to go to the bathroom.
I got tangled up in these.

42:58.866 --> 43:01.737
- Damn!
- I should've moved this stuff.

43:03.204 --> 43:07.070
I should be able to go to
the bathroom by myself.

43:07.290 --> 43:10.493
It's my fault.
I didn't leave a lamp on.

43:10.710 --> 43:13.580
I tried. But I got tangled up...

43:16.757 --> 43:18.749
It's no big deal, Dad.

43:19.926 --> 43:22.002
My pajamas are soaked!

43:22.220 --> 43:23.963
Well, don't worry.

43:24.180 --> 43:27.465
I haven't wet the bed
since I was 5!

43:30.894 --> 43:35.805
All right. Just sit down here, okay?
I'll put the shower on.

43:37.275 --> 43:40.229
You shouldn't have to do this, Mark.

43:42.446 --> 43:45.945
Think how many times
you did this for me when I was little.

43:46.158 --> 43:48.399
Well, I'm a grown man.

43:49.452 --> 43:51.409
Whoa, wait, wait.

43:56.250 --> 43:58.538
This isn't right, Mark.

44:01.171 --> 44:04.456
- It just isn't right.
- I know, Dad.

44:04.716 --> 44:06.340
I know.

44:09.303 --> 44:11.628
Let's just rest for a minute.
