Oh, good morning there,

00:44.212 --> 00:46.614
I'm just posting
"no trespassing" signs

00:46.647 --> 00:50.284
on my land, to make sure you
don't set foot on my land,

00:50.318 --> 00:52.220
which you thought
was your land,

00:52.253 --> 00:54.422
which is all the land
around your house

00:54.455 --> 00:56.890
except for the land
under your house.

00:56.924 --> 00:58.426
I know it's your land,

it was my land
all this time.

00:59.993 --> 01:02.396
But it's my land, ain't it?
Yep, it is.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.765
'Cause the courts agree,
and so does the county,

01:04.798 --> 01:06.234
and I got the deed
to prove it.

-J'ain't gotta rub it in!

a law of some sort, ain't it?

04:08.982 --> 04:11.084
Yeah, Early.
It's called trespassing.

04:11.118 --> 04:12.320

have sex with his daddy

09:47.487 --> 09:48.822
behind your daddy's back?

09:48.856 --> 09:51.759
And now she's
marryin' his son.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.460
What a crazy world.

09:53.493 --> 09:58.431
We are here to join Dewberry
Devereaux Duvall Jr, Sr, Sr...

09:58.465 --> 10:01.568
Jr, Sr, Sr was
my daddy's name.

10:01.601 --> 10:08.008
Please call me
Jr, Sr, Sr, Jr, Sr, Jr.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.077
Sorry. Uh...

10:10.110 --> 10:15.649
...and Ruby Jean Cuyler
in unconventional matrimony.

10:15.683 --> 10:19.419
If anyone objects
to this...creepy union,

10:19.452 --> 10:21.989
speak now...or later.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.757
Speak whenever.

10:23.791 --> 10:26.593
I feel weird doin' this.
Early?

10:26.626 --> 10:30.297
I noticed you didn't bring your
shotgun or your compound bow.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.700
I can't believe I'm sayin' this,
Early, but...

10:32.733 --> 10:35.102
you need to run out to the truck
or anything?

10:35.135 --> 10:38.806
This is your mama
and your most-hated rival.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.608
Any objections, Early?

10:41.641 --> 10:44.144
You usually like to speak
in these situations.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.379
You're damn right!
I do wish to speak!

10:46.413 --> 10:48.949
Daddy, don't.
It's over. He won.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.418
Fine! Fine! We lose!
Fuck it!

10:51.451 --> 10:52.452
God damn it!

10:52.485 --> 10:55.055
Made in Georgia, okay?!
Made in Georgia!
