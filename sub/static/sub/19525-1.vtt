03:56.869 --> 03:57.736
Hey, airport?

03:57.738 --> 03:59.238
Yeah. All right.

04:01.175 --> 04:02.608
Sorry, I'm in a...
In a hurry

04:02.610 --> 04:03.342
cool, no problem.

04:03.344 --> 04:03.942
What...

04:03.944 --> 04:04.610
What air-... airline?

04:04.612 --> 04:05.377
China air.

04:05.379 --> 04:06.379
Okay.

04:15.655 --> 04:17.555
I'm visiting here, my
first time in the city.

04:17.690 --> 04:18.457
Oh, yeah?

04:18.459 --> 04:19.257
This is...

04:19.260 --> 04:20.091
What do you think?

04:20.094 --> 04:21.260
It's a nice city, nice town.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.528
I'll probably be
back in a month...

04:23.530 --> 04:23.528
Okay.

04:23.530 --> 04:25.631
Because I have, uh,
another meeting next month.

04:25.633 --> 04:26.565
I'm in real estate.

04:26.567 --> 04:27.966
You're in real estate?

04:27.968 --> 04:27.966
Yeah.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.002
But, you know,
residential market's pretty dry.

04:30.004 --> 04:30.869
So...

04:30.871 --> 04:31.336
Okay.

04:31.338 --> 04:32.604
How about you?

04:32.606 --> 04:34.539
Are you, uh, you
married, your family live here?

04:34.541 --> 04:34.539
Yeah.

04:34.541 --> 04:34.539
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

04:34.541 --> 04:36.408
My wife and I.

04:36.410 --> 04:36.408
She's in real estate, too.

04:36.410 --> 04:40.279
She does commercial real estate,
so a lot of this stuff that she

04:40.281 --> 04:42.414
sells is those
buildings and lots for.

04:42.416 --> 04:42.414
So...

04:42.416 --> 04:43.548
Okay...

04:43.550 --> 04:44.283
It keeps her busy.

04:44.285 --> 04:44.916
She's killing it.

04:44.918 --> 04:44.916
Nice.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.386
She doesn't need to
drive cars, you know?

05:03.804 --> 05:05.003
Yeah, it's gonna be great.

05:07.573 --> 05:09.308
Yeah, Christine's
gonna meet us there.

05:13.047 --> 05:14.313
Oh, my god.

05:15.415 --> 05:16.481
I know.

05:27.093 --> 05:28.660
Sounds like you got
a fun night ahead.

05:29.996 --> 05:30.996
Nothing too crazy.

05:33.099 --> 05:35.000
Just a night out with the girls?

05:36.336 --> 05:37.669
A couple of friends, yeah.

05:39.038 --> 05:42.107
Just keep the guys
away, looking like that.

05:45.545 --> 05:46.712
My boyfriend won't be there.

05:47.580 --> 05:48.580
I'm not too worried.

05:51.617 --> 05:52.884
I'm sure he's a lucky man.

06:01.627 --> 06:04.463
If you guys, you know, get
too crazy and need a drive or

06:04.465 --> 06:05.931
anything, you just
let me know, okay?

06:07.100 --> 06:10.535
You can reserve a chauffeur
service on the app if you just,

06:10.537 --> 06:12.104
uh, open the home screen...

06:12.405 --> 06:13.105
Thanks.

06:13.107 --> 06:14.139
Um, we'll be all set.

06:16.609 --> 06:17.609
All right.

06:37.131 --> 06:39.364
I'm just gonna get a, uh...

06:42.769 --> 06:43.935
A number 8 combo.

06:44.604 --> 06:45.604
Crunchy or soft?

06:46.038 --> 06:47.038
Crunchy.

08:13.526 --> 08:14.646
So, how much longer you got?

08:17.797 --> 08:18.897
Uh, not too long.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.565
Looks like eight minutes.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.535
No, I mean you, your shift.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.005
Oh, geez.

08:27.707 --> 08:28.206
Long time.

08:28.208 --> 08:28.206
All night.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.941
I don't know, 5 A.M.

08:30.743 --> 08:32.222
Oh, your night's
just beginning, then.

08:32.511 --> 08:33.211
Mmm.

08:33.212 --> 08:34.679
Tell me about it.

08:35.715 --> 08:36.715
Enjoy it?

08:38.417 --> 08:39.217
Yeah, it's fine.
Yeah.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.052
Extra cash, flexible.

08:41.554 --> 08:42.953
So, what's your day job, then?

08:42.956 --> 08:43.956
Real estate.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.824
Residential, mostly.

08:47.026 --> 08:50.195
But market's dry, right now, so
this keeps me out of the house.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.564
You need to get out
of the house, do you?

08:54.166 --> 08:55.233
Sure, sometimes.

08:55.635 --> 08:56.668
Like tonight?

08:58.804 --> 08:59.804
Most nights, lately.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.041
Oh, there it is.

09:03.676 --> 09:05.076
The missus kicking you out, eh?

09:06.646 --> 09:09.180
Yeah, it's a little more
complicated than that.

09:11.617 --> 09:12.684
So, is she a mother?

09:15.388 --> 09:16.354
No, we don't have kids.

09:16.356 --> 09:17.489
She's in real estate, too.

09:17.491 --> 09:19.190
So, you met her
on the job, then?

09:20.293 --> 09:21.626
No, we met in school.

09:22.795 --> 09:25.797
She pursued commercial real
estate, which is a pretty hot

09:25.799 --> 09:27.232
market right now.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.867
So, keeps her busy.

09:29.735 --> 09:30.902
So, you don't need the cash?

09:32.605 --> 09:34.205
Well, that's her
market, that ain't mine.

09:34.307 --> 09:35.373
But she is your wife.

09:35.375 --> 09:36.641
Don't you share your income?

09:38.311 --> 09:39.177
The bills get paid.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.746
Yet you're out here driving
strangers around all night?

09:44.116 --> 09:45.784
Yeah, like I said,
out of the house.

09:47.321 --> 09:48.720
Away from her is more like it.

09:52.191 --> 09:53.692
Sorry, just making conversation.

09:58.998 --> 10:00.098
She's not missing me.

10:01.767 --> 10:02.767
And how do you know?

10:08.708 --> 10:09.074
Sorry, man.

10:09.076 --> 10:09.841
I, ah...

10:09.843 --> 10:11.309
I don't want to get into it.

10:16.248 --> 10:17.248
Love.

10:18.651 --> 10:19.951
Love, love, love.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.186
Don't that just fuck all, yeah?

10:21.188 --> 10:22.120
Doesn't make any sense.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.655
Who could possibly love?

10:25.892 --> 10:26.892
You got me.

10:27.893 --> 10:28.893
So, what comes first?

10:28.895 --> 10:29.394
Desire?

10:29.396 --> 10:30.195
Love?

10:30.197 --> 10:31.197
Marriage?

10:33.733 --> 10:36.101
Uh, I don't know.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.268
It seems like the right order.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.190
But that's the parody, ain't it?

10:39.772 --> 10:42.407
The only righteous grounds for
marriage is first to be in love.

10:42.409 --> 10:43.409
Do you believe that?

10:46.646 --> 10:48.213
Uh, am I not supposed to?

10:49.281 --> 10:52.050
Well, if so, then a marriage
which no longer renders such

10:52.052 --> 10:53.652
excitement is no longer binding.

10:57.312 --> 10:58.391
You're a romantic.

10:58.392 --> 11:02.394
You're convinced that love is
irresistible and yet, somehow

11:02.396 --> 11:03.995
inherently praiseworthy.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.364
A steady diet of shite
poets will see to that.

11:07.266 --> 11:09.401
And it's not just you,
it's the whole lot of you.

11:09.403 --> 11:12.937
Now, wormwood once said it
was an incomparable recipe for

11:12.939 --> 11:17.342
prolonged tragic adulteries
ending, if all went well, in

11:17.344 --> 11:18.710
murders and suicides.

11:20.212 --> 11:21.980
Failing that, it's
a useful marriage.

11:23.215 --> 11:24.215
"Useful"?

11:25.184 --> 11:26.184
Useful for whom?

11:27.420 --> 11:29.154
Well, certainly not
for you, my friend.

11:29.455 --> 11:30.755
I can guarantee you that.

11:31.724 --> 11:32.724
I don't know wormwood.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.125
I don't suppose you would.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.961
I don't think I'd
like to, either.

11:37.797 --> 11:39.297
No, you wouldn't, I
can guarantee it.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.800
He was quoting his uncle,
and they're a couple of tricky

11:41.802 --> 11:42.233
bastards.

11:42.235 --> 11:45.870
I guess everyone's got to get in
their commentary on love, how?

11:47.440 --> 11:49.374
Just pick the one
that suits you, eh?

11:49.376 --> 11:50.442
Right.

11:51.243 --> 11:52.444
The thing is, they all suck.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.046
Some are better than others.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.047
Yeah, like what?

11:56.049 --> 11:58.083
Love is love, feelings aside.

12:00.453 --> 12:01.453
What?

12:02.354 --> 12:04.255
Love is love, feelings aside?

12:04.257 --> 12:06.124
Are you a teacher or something?

12:06.493 --> 12:09.027
Never even
finished secondary school.

12:11.263 --> 12:12.363
Well, you're a smart guy.

12:12.365 --> 12:16.201
Fellas like me, we say smart
things, it doesn't make a smart.

12:16.203 --> 12:17.769
Or honest, for that matter.

12:18.306 --> 12:19.205
Great.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.772
You're full of shit, then.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.775
Now, that's the
god's honest truth.

12:25.811 --> 12:29.380
So is this: The state of love as
you define it has fuck-all to do

12:29.382 --> 12:31.015
with your marriage
or your happiness.

12:32.351 --> 12:33.351
As I define it?

12:33.686 --> 12:35.019
How do I define it?

12:36.856 --> 12:37.856
Like a romantic.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.226
Well, I think...

12:42.061 --> 12:43.795
I think I'm
actually done with it.

12:44.030 --> 12:47.098
As a romantic would
be, no fight left.

12:48.834 --> 12:50.354
There's nothing left
to fight, anymore.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.037
Oh, you just don't
know what to fight.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.173
So to fight for is
to fight against.

12:55.374 --> 12:57.308
The other or the
self is the question.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.979
Is our nature
competition or cooperation?

13:03.382 --> 13:04.349
Are you ask-...?

13:04.351 --> 13:04.349
Is...?

13:04.351 --> 13:06.417
I don't think I understand.

13:07.086 --> 13:07.719
Is that worm-...?

13:07.721 --> 13:08.820
Is this wormwood again?

13:08.822 --> 13:11.990
I know what he would say,
"one thing is not another thing."

13:11.992 --> 13:15.460
Your good is your good and my
good is mine and what one gains,

13:15.462 --> 13:15.460
another loses.

13:15.462 --> 13:19.531
Even an inanimate object is
what it is by denying all other

13:19.533 --> 13:21.466
objects into the
space which it occupies.

13:21.901 --> 13:24.569
And if it chooses to expand, it
does so either thrusting other

13:24.571 --> 13:27.105
objects out of the way
or by absorbing them.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.807
"The same is true of the self."

13:29.141 --> 13:32.177
So to wormwood, "to be"
means to be in competition.

13:34.013 --> 13:36.414
Now, his opponents on the
other hand, they strive for a

13:36.416 --> 13:42.086
contradiction: That a thing is
one, but yet also many, that the

13:42.088 --> 13:44.455
good of oneself can be
the good of another.

13:45.157 --> 13:47.892
And this
impossibility, they call love.

13:50.131 --> 13:51.030
Great.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.497
Love is impossible.

13:55.034 --> 13:56.568
Like I said, it
doesn't make sense.

13:59.338 --> 14:02.240
Why are you wasting your
time then, reading wormwood?

14:03.242 --> 14:04.242
Never said I read him.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.148
Are you married?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.983
Certainly not.

14:11.985 --> 14:12.985
Jesus.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.953
What the fuck am I
listening to you for?

14:14.955 --> 14:17.989
Because I'm paying
you to drive me around.

14:20.226 --> 14:24.195
I gotta tell you, man, I
don't even know what marriage is

14:24.197 --> 14:25.964
supposed to mean, anymore.

14:29.335 --> 14:31.970
I mean, what if it's
literally just a sheet of paper?

14:35.808 --> 14:37.909
Well, you still have
plenty of paper in this world.

14:37.977 --> 14:39.878
There's always a fresh
sheet when you need it.

14:40.446 --> 14:41.312
Yeah.

14:41.314 --> 14:43.281
Well, anyway, we're here.

14:43.582 --> 14:44.582
That's you.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.587
Hey, I really
appreciate the conversation.

14:50.289 --> 14:51.289
Me too, Eric.

14:52.992 --> 14:54.259
How did you know my name?

14:55.527 --> 14:56.527
It's on the app.

14:58.999 --> 14:59.999
Take it easy.

15:01.267 --> 15:03.001
To fight for is
to fight against.

15:03.369 --> 15:04.469
The other or the self?

15:07.172 --> 15:09.440
There's still a long night
ahead for you, I'm afraid.

15:09.442 --> 15:10.608
What?

15:10.610 --> 15:11.610
Sorry?

16:16.008 --> 16:20.311
Dude, that girl was
begging for it, man.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.480
Like, the least you
can do is, you gotta...

16:22.482 --> 16:24.282
You gotta humor her
a girl like that.

16:24.284 --> 16:24.282
I'm not...

16:24.284 --> 16:27.552
I'll have a conversation, you
know, maybe a couple of drinks.

16:27.554 --> 16:30.655
But I'm not doing
anything crazy tonight.

16:30.657 --> 16:31.657
It's way too soon.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.658
Fuck Madison, okay?

16:34.393 --> 16:35.293
Fuck her.

16:35.295 --> 16:38.563
I told you she was gonna go
running back to Jordan as soon

16:38.565 --> 16:40.531
as Miranda canned his ass.

16:40.533 --> 16:45.103
The least you could do is hook
up with a beauty like that, man.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.738
She was begging for it, man.

16:46.740 --> 16:48.373
She didn't leave me for Jordan.

16:49.575 --> 16:52.410
And even if she did, hooking up
with a random stranger is not

16:52.412 --> 16:54.212
gonna help salvage my dignity.

16:56.716 --> 16:59.183
You're so much better
off without her, man.

16:59.185 --> 17:03.287
Look, I didn't want to say
this, but, uh, she's a fucking

17:03.289 --> 17:03.287
buzzkill, okay?

17:03.289 --> 17:06.324
I mean, anytime you bring
her over to the house, I...

17:06.760 --> 17:09.493
Shut the fuck up, okay?

17:09.627 --> 17:12.563
Kate upton could show up
completely topless and if she

17:12.565 --> 17:15.465
took two seconds to engage your
intellect, you'd fucking call

17:15.468 --> 17:16.567
her a buzzkill.

17:17.069 --> 17:17.068
No shit.

17:17.069 --> 17:18.803
Just fuck a hooker, okay?

17:18.805 --> 17:20.972
Fuck a hooker if
that's all you care about.

17:20.973 --> 17:23.040
It's gotta be better than
this club charade we keep doing.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.108
You know, man.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.311
Madison really did a
mind job on you, man.

17:28.314 --> 17:29.814
It definitely wasn't
another kind of job.

17:29.816 --> 17:30.816
Ha, ha.

17:31.918 --> 17:32.550
All right, guys.

17:32.552 --> 17:33.552
This is you.

17:52.839 --> 17:53.839
Hey, you see me?

17:55.074 --> 17:56.074
Hey there.

17:56.475 --> 17:57.475
Across the street.

17:57.609 --> 17:58.376
I'm in the silver...

17:58.378 --> 17:58.376
Silver...

17:58.378 --> 17:59.378
Silver SUV.

18:01.413 --> 18:01.813
Got it?

18:01.815 --> 18:02.815
All right.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.106
You got to be
fucking kidding me.

18:30.878 --> 18:31.777
Hey.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.578
Hey, come on in.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.283
Hey.

18:40.185 --> 18:41.252
Is that where we're going?

18:41.620 --> 18:43.454
Yeah, 4311 wood green.

18:43.456 --> 18:43.454
Yeah.

18:43.456 --> 18:46.224
You can just drop me off
at the corner of abbeydale.

18:46.660 --> 18:47.559
All right.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.894
Looks like about,
uh, 30 minutes.

18:49.896 --> 18:50.896
Sounds about right.

18:51.730 --> 18:52.797
All right.

19:06.345 --> 19:07.345
Hey.

19:12.251 --> 19:13.251
Yeah, you too.

19:17.756 --> 19:19.290
Uh, yeah, me too.

19:19.292 --> 19:19.290
I would...

19:19.292 --> 19:20.892
I would if I could.

19:23.295 --> 19:24.395
Uh, what about Thursday?

19:26.765 --> 19:27.832
Mmm, no.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.200
No, I got to head home.

19:29.801 --> 19:31.836
Early flight in the
morning, you know?

19:35.507 --> 19:36.574
Send me a picture?

19:39.811 --> 19:40.578
Yeah, okay.

19:40.779 --> 19:41.779
Bye.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.600
Lucky man.

20:04.403 --> 20:05.970
You still got the
honeymoon bliss, huh?

20:07.839 --> 20:10.441
Uh, yeah, that's not my...

20:10.776 --> 20:11.776
I'm not married, man.

20:12.511 --> 20:13.511
Oh.

20:14.346 --> 20:15.346
Just your girl, then?

20:19.519 --> 20:20.618
Just your girl, then?

20:21.353 --> 20:22.486
Sorry?

20:22.488 --> 20:24.355
I said, was that your girl?

20:24.923 --> 20:25.923
On the phone?

20:27.759 --> 20:29.860
It's a lady I've
been seeing, yeah.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.395
Huh.

20:32.731 --> 20:33.731
But not your girlfriend?

20:34.299 --> 20:34.999
No.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.001
Too early.

20:36.635 --> 20:37.635
Early?

20:40.405 --> 20:41.606
Yeah, it takes time.

20:42.541 --> 20:43.541
Time to what?

20:45.811 --> 20:46.877
You know.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.346
Are you married?

20:51.416 --> 20:52.416
Yes, I am.

20:52.884 --> 20:53.884
So, you know.

20:54.486 --> 20:55.486
What do I know?

20:55.488 --> 20:59.423
It takes time to find out,
you know, if she's the one.

21:02.027 --> 21:03.027
The one?

21:04.496 --> 21:05.496
One to what?

21:07.833 --> 21:08.833
One to date?

21:10.168 --> 21:11.168
One to marry?

21:12.371 --> 21:13.371
One to just fuck?

21:14.673 --> 21:15.673
Damn, man.

21:18.511 --> 21:19.511
Sorry, man.

21:19.645 --> 21:20.645
You're good.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.313
Busting my balls.

21:22.315 --> 21:23.347
Hey.

21:23.349 --> 21:24.349
I'm Eric.

21:24.549 --> 21:25.549
Patrick. Hey.

21:26.251 --> 21:27.785
Uh, man, sorry for
giving you shit.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.253
But you look like
you can take it.

21:29.255 --> 21:31.322
Nah, I get enough of
that all day at work.

21:31.324 --> 21:32.323
I hear you.

21:32.325 --> 21:32.323
What do you do?

21:32.325 --> 21:36.027
I do, uh, land development,
commercial construction, you

21:36.029 --> 21:37.029
know, that sort of thing.

21:37.496 --> 21:37.495
Mmm.

21:37.497 --> 21:38.696
Good market now?

21:38.930 --> 21:40.364
Yeah.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.967
I mean, it takes, you know,
traveling to the right place,

21:42.969 --> 21:44.569
but yeah, this market
here's pretty good.

21:45.637 --> 21:46.570
So, uh...

21:46.572 --> 21:47.938
So, you live here?

21:48.674 --> 21:49.674
Yeah, for the most part.

21:50.375 --> 21:51.855
Uh, the market's good here,
now. So...

21:52.311 --> 21:53.344
Go where it's hot.

21:53.545 --> 21:54.412
That's right.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.047
Yeah, yeah.

21:57.082 --> 21:58.082
I do real estate.

21:58.717 --> 21:59.583
Oh, yeah?

21:59.585 --> 22:00.585
Yeah.

22:00.886 --> 22:02.053
Residential, mostly.

22:02.055 --> 22:03.387
But you know, that's dry.

22:04.523 --> 22:06.857
So, you know, this pays the
bills, brings in some extra

22:06.859 --> 22:09.827
income, while the, uh,
houses aren't selling.

22:10.462 --> 22:11.902
Market's heating up
though, isn't it?

22:12.364 --> 22:12.930
Slowly.

22:12.932 --> 22:12.930
But you know, you...

22:12.932 --> 22:16.267
You could shoot a bullet in
the air, in this town and you're

22:16.269 --> 22:18.629
gonna hit a real estate agent,
so it's just hard to compete.

22:19.071 --> 22:19.070
Hmm.

22:19.072 --> 22:20.538
Hang in there.

22:21.473 --> 22:23.353
Market heats up,
there'll be room for everybody.

22:24.509 --> 22:25.409
Yeah.

22:25.411 --> 22:28.112
I should've pursued
commercial, you know?

22:28.380 --> 22:29.613
Work with guys like you.

22:29.781 --> 22:29.780
Yeah, man.

22:29.782 --> 22:32.850
It's still feast or famine, but
you know, if you're willing to

22:32.852 --> 22:34.492
travel, you can make
a pretty good living.

22:36.054 --> 22:37.494
So, where are you
traveling tomorrow?

22:39.991 --> 22:40.991
Tomorrow?

22:41.161 --> 22:42.060
Yeah.

22:42.061 --> 22:45.896
On the phone, you said, uh,
you had an early morning flight.

22:47.699 --> 22:48.699
Oh.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.040
Well, it's not till, uh...

22:51.470 --> 22:52.603
It's Houston.

22:55.774 --> 22:57.408
Ah, I hear you.

22:57.943 --> 23:00.478
You just need, uh, some
time away from her, huh?

23:00.712 --> 23:02.880
She's not your
girlfriend, so time away's good.

23:03.515 --> 23:05.716
Well, even if she was my
girlfriend, you know, time away

23:05.718 --> 23:06.984
is always cool, right?

23:06.986 --> 23:06.984
Hmm.

23:06.986 --> 23:09.453
I mean, some me
time is always good.

23:11.457 --> 23:13.524
Why do you think I
drive a car all night?

23:18.964 --> 23:23.401
But, uh, you're
sleeping with her, right?

23:24.903 --> 23:25.903
Excuse me.

23:26.805 --> 23:28.038
The woman you're seeing.

23:29.074 --> 23:31.709
This isn't an
undercover cab, is it?

23:33.713 --> 23:34.578
No, man.

23:34.580 --> 23:35.780
It's just guys talking.

23:35.981 --> 23:35.980
Look, I'm sorry, man.

23:35.982 --> 23:39.517
I just don't know what
it's like anymore, you know?

23:39.519 --> 23:40.718
Out in the field.

23:40.720 --> 23:41.720
I got married young.

23:41.753 --> 23:42.853
I gotcha.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.755
I mean, not crazy young, but...

23:45.357 --> 23:45.356
You know.

23:45.358 --> 23:48.192
It's been a while, if
you know what I mean.

23:48.593 --> 23:50.461
Well, man, take a
trip to Vegas, you know.

23:50.463 --> 23:51.529
Get back out there.

23:51.830 --> 23:51.829
Shit, Patrick.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.831
I'm a married man.
Come on.

23:54.232 --> 23:55.699
It all stays in Vegas, right?

23:56.435 --> 23:57.435
It stays somewhere.

23:57.636 --> 23:57.635
Well, we could, uh...

23:57.637 --> 24:00.604
We could stop off at church
street, you know, hit up the

24:00.606 --> 24:01.606
nightlight.

24:02.107 --> 24:03.187
That'd be a story.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.744
What, you've never
had a lap dance, Eric?

24:07.713 --> 24:08.813
I wish.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.014
I wouldn't know what to do.

24:11.016 --> 24:12.917
Yeah, that's the beauty of it.

24:12.919 --> 24:14.084
You don't do nothing.

24:17.189 --> 24:18.189
That ain't nothing.

24:19.958 --> 24:21.225
To each his own, I guess.

24:24.830 --> 24:30.668
See, the thing is, my wife and
I, we were each other's firsts.

24:31.703 --> 24:32.236
Damn, man.

24:32.504 --> 24:33.504
Congrats.

24:35.774 --> 24:37.054
That's something
to congratulate?

24:38.243 --> 24:39.243
Sure, I think.

24:40.111 --> 24:41.145
Monogamy?

24:41.713 --> 24:42.980
Yeah.
I mean, it...

24:42.982 --> 24:44.482
It's rare, at least.

24:44.950 --> 24:44.949
Yeah, it's true.

24:44.951 --> 24:48.752
I guess we
congratulate what's rare, huh?

24:48.754 --> 24:53.924
I don't know, man, all
those years, one woman.

24:55.660 --> 24:56.820
What happened, the fire gone?

24:57.662 --> 24:59.763
Yeah, gone somewhere.

25:00.699 --> 25:02.199
Out of my bed, that's for sure.

25:02.936 --> 25:03.835
Damn, man.

25:03.836 --> 25:06.036
Let's get to that lap dance.

25:06.038 --> 25:08.739
I'd be like a teenager in there.

25:10.842 --> 25:13.511
So, uh, how long
have you been married?

25:15.780 --> 25:16.881
Almost 10 years.

25:18.650 --> 25:21.085
Well, I guess it takes, uh, take
some work, you know, keeping the

25:21.087 --> 25:22.520
fire going for 10 years.

25:23.221 --> 25:24.655
You speaking from experience?

25:25.257 --> 25:26.790
No, I'm just guessing.

25:27.134 --> 25:28.093
Yeah, you would.

25:28.094 --> 25:31.829
But you're really, uh, making
marriage look very tempting,

25:31.831 --> 25:32.831
brother.

25:35.567 --> 25:36.567
Got me there.

25:36.768 --> 25:37.768
Sorry.

25:38.803 --> 25:39.904
You got kids?

25:43.642 --> 25:45.075
Never managed to have a kid.

25:46.878 --> 25:48.679
I guess 10 years is
still something, right?

25:50.649 --> 25:51.949
Is it?

25:54.220 --> 25:57.321
If you don't mind me asking, I
mean, how's the, uh...

25:57.323 --> 25:58.722
the sex life?

26:01.593 --> 26:02.960
We haven't had sex
since Christmas.

26:03.562 --> 26:04.562
What?

26:04.798 --> 26:05.697
Damn, that's...

26:05.698 --> 26:07.565
That's no good, Eric.

26:08.733 --> 26:09.733
Yeah, what's the point?

26:11.803 --> 26:13.163
If she doesn't
love you anymore...?

26:14.639 --> 26:16.019
I wish I knew, brother.

26:16.107 --> 26:18.642
I'm the one who's trying
to avoid marriage, right?

26:19.344 --> 26:20.244
Smart man.

26:20.246 --> 26:24.582
Just try to find some
beautiful women to hook up with.

26:24.816 --> 26:24.815
Hey, man.

26:24.817 --> 26:26.684
I'm... I'm... I'm not
that guy.

26:30.789 --> 26:32.890
So, then, you really
like this girl, huh?

26:36.161 --> 26:37.661
Yeah, actually.

26:38.763 --> 26:39.863
I do.

26:39.865 --> 26:41.832
She's, uh, pretty amazing.

26:45.937 --> 26:47.371
So, you are
sleeping with her, then?

26:49.040 --> 26:50.360
Like I said,
she's pretty amazing.

26:55.947 --> 26:56.947
I bet she is.

26:57.983 --> 26:59.717
Guy like you, you get your pick.

26:59.851 --> 27:00.891
Yeah, I've done all right.

27:02.988 --> 27:03.988
Don't settle, man.

27:05.290 --> 27:06.357
You're young, you know?

27:06.359 --> 27:07.691
Take your time, play the field.

27:07.693 --> 27:07.691
Don't...

27:07.693 --> 27:09.026
Don't do what I did.

27:09.294 --> 27:10.728
I got no plans, man.

27:11.296 --> 27:13.130
Don't even tie yourself
down to one, you know.

27:13.132 --> 27:15.833
Just, uh, keep it
loose, play the field.

27:16.301 --> 27:17.901
Hey, where do you
think I'm heading, now?

27:18.637 --> 27:19.637
Huh?

27:21.707 --> 27:22.707
Shit, Patrick.

27:23.241 --> 27:25.242
Man, I bet you got a
girl in every city.

27:25.411 --> 27:27.044
It's nothing serious.

27:27.046 --> 27:29.713
Houston can't get
here soon enough, right?

27:30.148 --> 27:31.148
Houston is nice.

27:31.283 --> 27:33.717
But none of them tied
you down, though, right?

27:33.719 --> 27:34.719
Right?

27:34.886 --> 27:36.186
No, I told you,
man, nothing serious.

27:36.188 --> 27:36.186
And...

27:36.188 --> 27:38.822
And it's all mutual and
I can assure you that.

27:38.824 --> 27:39.323
Good man.

27:39.325 --> 27:40.325
Keep it loose.

27:41.059 --> 27:42.059
I'm trying.

27:43.995 --> 27:46.230
You know, one of them starts
falling in love with you, forget

27:46.232 --> 27:46.230
about it.

27:46.232 --> 27:49.066
They're just gonna start talking
about marriage, there's gonna be

27:49.068 --> 27:50.868
nothing you can do to escape.

27:51.069 --> 27:51.068
Hey, man.

27:51.070 --> 27:51.068
Nobody's talking marriage.

27:51.070 --> 27:55.172
You know what I
heard earlier tonight?

27:55.740 --> 27:55.739
What's that?

27:55.741 --> 27:57.307
Another guy I was driving.?

27:57.309 --> 28:01.979
He said, like, a marriage which
no longer has the excitement of,

28:01.981 --> 28:06.350
like, being in love,
is no longer binding.

28:08.620 --> 28:09.787
Is that what he said?

28:10.822 --> 28:13.123
Maybe he said the opposite,
like that was the joke.

28:13.291 --> 28:13.290
Parody.

28:13.292 --> 28:15.025
That's what he
called it, parody.

28:15.327 --> 28:18.128
I couldn't really tell
what the hell he was saying.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.863
I don't know, some
writer I'd never heard of.

28:19.865 --> 28:21.865
And that guy was full
of shit, too, so...

28:23.035 --> 28:24.101
What Sage wisdom.

28:24.304 --> 28:25.203
Yeah.

28:25.204 --> 28:28.572
No, I didn't really know what he
meant at the time, but I haven't

28:28.574 --> 28:30.340
been able to get
it out of my head.

28:33.211 --> 28:38.215
"Love has nothing to do with
marriage or its happiness."

28:41.986 --> 28:44.088
So, uh, love doesn't matter?

28:45.123 --> 28:46.123
Does it to animals?

28:46.825 --> 28:48.125
Animals aren't monogamous.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.060
Are humans?

28:50.328 --> 28:51.395
You are.

28:53.331 --> 28:54.331
That's true.

28:55.166 --> 28:56.900
Believe me, if only.

28:57.402 --> 28:59.436
Hey, how far is the
nightlight anyway, huh?

29:00.271 --> 29:01.271
No, man.

29:01.439 --> 29:02.806
Stay out of the strip clubs.

29:02.808 --> 29:04.448
You got yourself a
good thing going, Eric.

29:06.211 --> 29:10.481
Should have done what you did,
taken my time, played the field.

29:10.483 --> 29:12.083
But then you might
have missed your lady.

29:15.220 --> 29:16.220
Yeah.

29:24.996 --> 29:26.196
Shit, I'm sorry.

29:27.198 --> 29:30.467
Um, would you mind, Eric,
not texting and driving?

29:32.170 --> 29:33.170
Yeah, man.

29:33.238 --> 29:33.871
Sorry. I'm sorry.

29:33.873 --> 29:36.373
I'm just trying to get there
in one piece, you know, bro?

29:37.009 --> 29:38.208
Bad habit, sorry.

29:38.810 --> 29:39.476
One second.

29:39.778 --> 29:40.811
That's not it's all good.

29:52.357 --> 29:54.124
Just don't settle
too early, my man.

29:54.826 --> 29:56.093
Don't settle too early.

29:57.395 --> 29:58.562
You know what you should do?

29:58.564 --> 30:03.534
Like, maybe just try to find,
like, a married woman, you know,

30:04.068 --> 30:05.936
who's looking for excitement.

30:07.472 --> 30:09.406
They won't tie you down,
you know, married women.

30:09.408 --> 30:11.241
I hear married women
are where it's at.

30:11.243 --> 30:13.177
Yeah?
And who told you that?

30:14.078 --> 30:14.812
I don't know.

30:14.946 --> 30:16.113
Read it online, somewhere.

30:16.514 --> 30:16.513
Yeah.

30:16.515 --> 30:20.851
Well, don't believe
everything you read, bro.

30:27.492 --> 30:29.372
Yeah, I think my wife
could use some excitement.

30:29.996 --> 30:30.895
So...

30:30.896 --> 30:32.563
So, give it to her, man.

30:33.064 --> 30:34.932
Don't make her wait
till next Christmas, Eric.

30:35.433 --> 30:37.034
Hey, be the man, you know?

30:37.036 --> 30:39.069
Women want a guy who
can take the lead.

30:41.940 --> 30:43.073
She's over me.

30:43.575 --> 30:45.175
See, now, you're
sounding like a pussy.

30:47.879 --> 30:51.048
A guy can only take so much
rejection before he stops

30:51.050 --> 30:52.050
trying.

30:52.483 --> 30:53.483
And I've tried.

30:54.285 --> 30:55.485
So, just leave her.

30:55.954 --> 30:57.187
You know, find somebody else.

31:00.225 --> 31:01.225
Maybe I will.

31:03.261 --> 31:04.261
I think she has.

31:05.463 --> 31:06.463
What's that?

31:07.332 --> 31:10.100
I said I think she
has found someone else.

31:11.402 --> 31:12.436
Well, there you go, man.

31:12.871 --> 31:13.871
Problem solved.

31:16.241 --> 31:17.975
Yeah, I've seen him.

31:18.376 --> 31:19.877
I've seen him coming and going.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.547
I don't know him, never
seen him before that.

31:24.148 --> 31:26.583
I figured she met him
on the job or something.

31:27.685 --> 31:28.986
I mean, did you...

31:28.988 --> 31:30.254
Did you ever confront her?

31:30.822 --> 31:32.155
What, if she's cheating on me?

31:32.557 --> 31:33.423
No.

31:33.425 --> 31:35.259
Maybe I should have.

31:37.295 --> 31:39.963
Honestly, my first thought
was killing the bastard.

31:41.566 --> 31:44.101
And who wouldn't, you know,
fucking another man's wife?

31:44.936 --> 31:46.036
Right, right, right.

31:47.406 --> 31:48.305
You understand.

31:48.307 --> 31:52.242
I mean, if there's anything
worth killing a man over, right?

31:53.478 --> 31:54.945
That's as old as infidelity.

31:56.047 --> 31:58.415
Yeah, except one will
get you put in prison.

31:58.465 --> 31:59.484
Isn't that funny?

31:59.485 --> 32:02.920
We can fuck who we want, but
we can't kill who we want.

32:03.023 --> 32:03.922
Okay.

32:03.923 --> 32:03.921
Well, you can't really
fuck who you want, either.

32:03.923 --> 32:08.458
I mean, that will get you
put in prison too, in certain

32:08.460 --> 32:09.460
situations.

32:09.861 --> 32:11.361
Yeah, I guess you got me there.

32:12.397 --> 32:14.064
The law makes sense, huh?

32:17.168 --> 32:19.403
You can't take another man's
wife, Patrick,

32:23.174 --> 32:25.375
even if she's, uh...

32:26.678 --> 32:28.378
Even if he's a
pathetic piece of shit.

32:34.052 --> 32:35.519
They're married, you know?

32:38.156 --> 32:39.676
They've given
themselves to each other.

32:40.625 --> 32:43.093
Should I give her to him,
if that's what she wants?

32:45.997 --> 32:46.997
Or should I fight?

32:52.036 --> 32:53.036
That's what he meant.

32:53.372 --> 32:57.240
He said, "humans think
affection is what makes a"

32:57.242 --> 32:58.242
marriage."

32:59.177 --> 33:00.177
It's not.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.132
It's not that
love doesn't matter.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.749
It's that love isn't
what we thought it was.

33:09.420 --> 33:10.420
It's not.

33:12.357 --> 33:13.757
Love isn't...

33:16.696 --> 33:17.595
You...

33:17.596 --> 33:19.162
You...
You okay, man?

33:19.998 --> 33:20.664
You, uh...

33:20.666 --> 33:23.700
You want to let me out so that
you can, you know, work on your

33:23.702 --> 33:24.702
shit?

33:26.738 --> 33:28.038
No, Patrick.

33:29.507 --> 33:30.874
No, our night's just beginning.

33:33.546 --> 33:34.445
What...

33:34.446 --> 33:35.879
What does that mean?

33:37.448 --> 33:39.082
Hey, you know what, man?

33:39.084 --> 33:39.082
Just...

33:39.084 --> 33:40.917
You can let me out
right here and...

33:40.919 --> 33:42.352
And I'll pay for the full ride.

33:42.354 --> 33:42.352
I mean, I...

33:42.354 --> 33:44.254
I can walk it from here.

33:44.622 --> 33:45.622
We're almost there.

33:48.128 --> 33:49.027
You sure?

33:49.028 --> 33:52.129
Because you're kind of acting
like you need to go to sleep or

33:52.131 --> 33:52.729
something, man.

33:52.731 --> 33:52.729
How... how...

33:52.731 --> 33:54.865
How long have you
been driving, bro?

33:54.867 --> 33:55.867
I'm not tired.

33:59.170 --> 34:01.610
What did you mean when you said,
"our night's just beginning"?

34:06.277 --> 34:08.378
I guess she never
showed you a picture of me.

34:13.484 --> 34:15.619
Maybe she told
you she was, uh...

34:16.219 --> 34:17.219
Wasn't married.

34:17.755 --> 34:19.688
That it?

34:19.891 --> 34:21.731
You thought you'd been
with an available woman?

34:23.694 --> 34:26.463
Or did you know that it was me
you've been fucking when you've

34:26.465 --> 34:27.563
been fucking her?

34:29.000 --> 34:31.101
Hey, Eric, I think you've got
me confused with somebody else,

34:31.103 --> 34:32.803
okay?
Audrey Hollister.

34:35.206 --> 34:37.641
Audrey Angela Hollister.

34:38.176 --> 34:41.311
431 broad street, apartment 16b.

34:42.413 --> 34:43.146
Fuck.

34:43.148 --> 34:43.713
My wife.

34:43.715 --> 34:45.215
Fuck. Look...

34:45.217 --> 34:46.283
Ten years in January.

34:46.284 --> 34:48.085
Look, man, just let
me out of the car.

34:48.087 --> 34:48.418
No.

34:48.420 --> 34:48.418
Oh, no.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.554
You and me are gonna talk.

34:51.856 --> 34:54.091
Of all the fucking
cars in the city.

34:55.092 --> 34:57.094
Of all the fucking
fares in this city.

34:59.297 --> 35:03.700
Hey, Eric, I never knew
she was your wife, okay?

35:04.469 --> 35:06.169
Lies are only
gonna bury you deeper.

35:06.471 --> 35:08.872
Hey, you keep threatening me,
I'm gonna knock your ass out.

35:08.874 --> 35:10.173
Oh, that's
sounding like a threat.

35:10.175 --> 35:11.255
Now, who's threatening who?

35:11.709 --> 35:13.310
I don't know you, man.
I do-... I...

35:13.312 --> 35:15.545
I don't know what you have in
this car, talking about killing

35:15.547 --> 35:16.847
the man who's fucking your wife.

35:16.849 --> 35:16.847
I mean, that's a threat.

35:16.849 --> 35:19.749
I would not take that
angle, if I were you.

35:19.751 --> 35:22.285
You're driving me and I don't
feel very safe with you behind

35:22.287 --> 35:23.587
the wheel, so you know what?

35:24.522 --> 35:26.623
You want to talk man-to-man,
pull over and we can talk.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.525
What, you think I'm
gonna hurt you, Patrick?

35:28.527 --> 35:28.525
No.

35:28.527 --> 35:28.525
You know why?

35:28.527 --> 35:32.129
'Cause I'm not the guy who preys
on every beautiful woman that he

35:32.131 --> 35:32.662
sees.

35:32.664 --> 35:33.630
Neither am I.

35:33.632 --> 35:33.630
You know something?

35:33.632 --> 35:35.866
You need to talk
with your wife, man.

35:35.868 --> 35:35.866
She pursued me.

35:35.868 --> 35:38.368
She's the one who's unhappy.

35:39.470 --> 35:40.637
I have boundaries.
I... I...

35:40.639 --> 35:42.973
I never wanted to come
between a man and his wife.

35:42.975 --> 35:44.508
So, you did know
she was married?

35:44.510 --> 35:46.276
Hey, you said it
yourself, the love is gone.

35:46.278 --> 35:48.145
You haven't had
sex since Christmas.

35:48.147 --> 35:48.145
What...

35:48.147 --> 35:48.145
What did you expect?

35:48.147 --> 35:51.248
Audrey, Audrey, Audrey.

35:52.183 --> 35:54.284
Look, you need to
talk this out with her.

35:54.286 --> 35:55.919
Don't shift your shit on me.

35:56.721 --> 35:58.688
End this charade before your
meaningless 10-year milestone

35:58.690 --> 35:58.688
and...

35:58.690 --> 36:00.824
And just let her
live her life, man.

36:00.826 --> 36:01.625
Let her be happy.

36:01.627 --> 36:01.625
What, with you?

36:01.627 --> 36:05.662
You, who's going to another
random girl here on fucking wood

36:05.664 --> 36:06.897
green street?
Hey... hey...

36:06.964 --> 36:08.431
Hey, I never said
that, all right?

36:09.600 --> 36:14.938
And you may not want to hear
this or anything, but Audrey's

36:14.940 --> 36:17.240
not just some
fling for me, okay?

36:17.242 --> 36:18.475
We actually took it slow.

36:18.477 --> 36:20.143
Oh, fuck you.

36:20.145 --> 36:21.745
Hey, you want to
hear this, don't you?

36:21.747 --> 36:22.512
You wanted to talk.

36:22.514 --> 36:22.512
So, man up, Eric.

36:22.514 --> 36:25.282
Let's talk or let me
out of the goddamn car.

36:25.284 --> 36:26.650
We're almost there.

36:26.918 --> 36:28.485
Yeah, we took it slow.

36:29.287 --> 36:31.621
We actually had a
few dates, you know.

36:31.623 --> 36:34.758
Coffee, movies.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.459
It was like being
back in college.

36:36.461 --> 36:38.795
And then, the coffee and
movies moved into her apartment.

36:38.797 --> 36:40.363
You're just gonna make
this worse, Patrick.

36:40.365 --> 36:41.965
And then, things
started to get physical.

36:42.400 --> 36:44.834
Oh, man, that first kiss...

36:46.638 --> 36:49.706
Audrey said that she hadn't
felt that kind of connection in

36:49.708 --> 36:50.708
years.

36:50.775 --> 36:52.475
She's a married woman, Patrick.

36:52.477 --> 36:52.475
Years.

36:52.477 --> 36:55.612
Fuck you, connections
don't mean shit, okay?

36:55.614 --> 36:57.647
We have something that you
and her will never have.

36:57.649 --> 36:59.316
Yeah, and you let it die.

36:59.318 --> 37:00.350
No, you killed it.

37:00.352 --> 37:00.350
You know, people exaggerate
about their exes, but now, I

37:00.352 --> 37:05.789
kind of see exactly
what fucking happened.

37:05.791 --> 37:07.691
She's not my ex, asshole.

37:07.858 --> 37:09.526
We're still
fucking married, okay?

37:09.727 --> 37:09.726
And you seduced her.

37:09.728 --> 37:13.396
She was faithful to me
until you fucking seduced her.

37:13.398 --> 37:15.332
Wake the fuck up,
Eric, all right?

37:15.334 --> 37:16.900
She begged me to do it.
What... what...

37:16.902 --> 37:19.302
What do you think, I go around
this city looking for married

37:19.304 --> 37:20.437
women to hook up with?

37:20.638 --> 37:20.637
No.

37:20.639 --> 37:20.637
What... what...

37:20.639 --> 37:24.341
What do you think, that I didn't
say, "hey, no, you're married."

37:24.343 --> 37:25.742
We shouldn't...

37:25.744 --> 37:26.744
We shouldn't do this"?

37:26.844 --> 37:27.777
But you did.

37:27.779 --> 37:29.312
It's Audrey, okay?

37:29.480 --> 37:29.479
You...

37:29.481 --> 37:30.747
You should know, man.

37:30.749 --> 37:31.615
She's beautiful.

37:31.617 --> 37:32.549
She's amazing.

37:32.551 --> 37:34.411
You don't say her fucking name.

37:35.019 --> 37:37.587
If she's looking elsewhere, it's
because you let her look, okay?

37:37.589 --> 37:39.656
You never fought
for your marriage.

37:39.658 --> 37:42.025
How could you neglect
somebody like Audrey?

37:42.393 --> 37:42.392
Neglect?

37:42.394 --> 37:44.861
Is that what she told you?

37:45.263 --> 37:46.563
She's been trying, Eric.

37:46.565 --> 37:48.298
She said she'd been
trying for years, but...

37:48.300 --> 37:49.799
But you, you keep
pushing her away.

37:49.801 --> 37:49.799
Thank you.

37:49.801 --> 37:52.869
Thank you for being the
impartial therapist in this

37:52.871 --> 37:54.271
relationship, okay?

37:54.405 --> 37:56.573
I'm the one who's trying.

37:56.575 --> 37:59.009
I'm the one who's
being pushed away.

37:59.011 --> 38:03.213
Look, man, this has nothing
to do with me, all right?

38:03.215 --> 38:04.814
You need to handle
this and talk...

38:04.949 --> 38:06.383
Talk this out with your wife.

38:06.851 --> 38:07.851
Yes, we will.

38:07.952 --> 38:08.952
Right now.

38:09.755 --> 38:10.487
Jesus.

38:10.489 --> 38:11.888
Hi. Yes, I did.

38:12.056 --> 38:12.055
Yes.

38:12.057 --> 38:12.055
Can you please, come out?

38:12.057 --> 38:15.492
I'm pulling up, can you just
please come out right now?

38:15.494 --> 38:15.492
What... what...

38:15.494 --> 38:18.028
What are you doing, Eric?
Just get in the car, okay?

38:18.030 --> 38:18.028
Thank you.

38:18.030 --> 38:19.396
What are you doing?

38:19.398 --> 38:19.396
Hey.

38:19.398 --> 38:20.530
Hey, look.

38:21.098 --> 38:21.998
I will... I will...

38:22.000 --> 38:24.067
I will leave Audrey alone, okay?

38:24.235 --> 38:25.101
I'll leave her alone.

38:25.103 --> 38:25.969
I... I... I'm sorry.

38:25.971 --> 38:27.804
I'm sorry for sleeping
with your wife, okay?

38:27.806 --> 38:27.804
But just...

38:27.806 --> 38:29.773
Just let me out, all right?

38:29.775 --> 38:29.773
I'm leaving.

38:29.775 --> 38:32.442
Open the fucking door, Eric.

38:33.244 --> 38:33.243
Hi.

38:33.245 --> 38:35.011
Can you please get in the car?

38:35.613 --> 38:36.546
What?

38:36.548 --> 38:37.548
What is it?

38:38.115 --> 38:39.549
Can you please get in the car?

38:46.390 --> 38:47.390
What is this?

38:48.592 --> 38:49.793
Just get in the car.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.328
Eric...

38:58.002 --> 38:59.235
Please get in the car.

39:14.652 --> 39:15.652
Where are we going?

39:16.620 --> 39:17.721
We're just gonna go talk.

39:19.390 --> 39:20.657
Can we talk at home, please?

39:21.525 --> 39:22.525
It's not far.

39:49.320 --> 39:50.487
What are you doing here?

39:51.722 --> 39:53.723
I just called a car
and he's who I got.

39:54.625 --> 39:55.792
Are you serious?

39:55.794 --> 39:56.826
Did you stalk him?

39:57.128 --> 39:57.127
No.

39:57.129 --> 40:01.097
And you don't have any room for
anger in this situation, okay?

40:01.832 --> 40:02.899
None.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.801
He's not gonna do
anything stupid, is he?

40:05.035 --> 40:05.769
Of course not.

40:05.771 --> 40:06.903
This isn't what that is.

40:07.071 --> 40:07.070
Yeah?

40:07.072 --> 40:08.705
Then what is it, Eric?

40:09.640 --> 40:11.541
Because you don't seem
very stable, right now.

40:11.744 --> 40:12.643
Do you...

40:12.644 --> 40:14.944
Do you have a gun in the car?

40:15.212 --> 40:16.913
Does he have a gun in the car?

40:16.915 --> 40:17.747
In the glove box.

40:17.749 --> 40:17.747
It's locked.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.416
But he's not gonna do anything.

40:19.517 --> 40:20.583
Well, h-how do you know?

40:20.785 --> 40:21.951
Because I know my husband.

40:22.953 --> 40:25.722
And he's got no room to
talk to me about cheating.

40:27.458 --> 40:28.458
What?

40:28.460 --> 40:30.794
You think this is like that?

40:31.695 --> 40:32.695
I never slept with her.

40:32.697 --> 40:34.197
You would have if
you had the chance.

40:34.199 --> 40:34.931
That's not true.

40:34.933 --> 40:38.067
If I hadn't gotten sick and
kept you from going on that

40:38.069 --> 40:40.470
trip, that's exactly
where it would've gone.

40:40.838 --> 40:40.837
That is...

40:40.839 --> 40:42.172
You don't know that.

40:42.440 --> 40:42.439
That's unfair.

40:42.441 --> 40:46.176
Just because you didn't fuck
her doesn't mean that you didn't

40:46.178 --> 40:47.043
cheat on me.

40:47.045 --> 40:50.146
I felt sick for
crossing those lines, okay?

40:50.748 --> 40:53.116
I loved you, I chose you, us.

40:53.617 --> 40:54.717
I chose us.

40:55.719 --> 40:57.954
How do you think I felt
being with you after that?

40:57.956 --> 41:00.190
That was five years ago.

41:00.658 --> 41:02.058
And you forgave me.

41:02.060 --> 41:03.526
Well, it's
clearly still an issue.

41:03.727 --> 41:05.695
I loved you and I
still love you.

41:05.930 --> 41:06.996
It's too late, Eric.

41:07.531 --> 41:08.231
No.

41:08.233 --> 41:09.233
No, it's not.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.901
Fuck this guy,
he's a piece of shit.

41:11.903 --> 41:11.901
Oh, thanks, Eric.

41:11.903 --> 41:15.138
You are just one of a whole list
of women that he sleeps with,

41:15.140 --> 41:16.072
whenever he wants.

41:16.074 --> 41:17.507
No... no, she's
not. Don't do this.

41:17.775 --> 41:20.510
You want to know where I
was taking him tonight?

41:20.512 --> 41:23.613
It wasn't home to rest
before his flight to Houston.

41:23.848 --> 41:25.215
It was to another woman's house.

41:25.749 --> 41:26.583
Is that true?

41:26.585 --> 41:26.583
No.

41:26.585 --> 41:29.953
And fuck you, Eric, lecturing
me about another man's wife when

41:29.955 --> 41:32.655
y-you had an affair
what, five years ago?

41:32.857 --> 41:34.757
Maybe it was your wife
I was taking you to.

41:34.759 --> 41:36.559
You know, that would
make a lot of sense.

41:36.561 --> 41:36.559
Are you married?

41:36.561 --> 41:38.862
No, I'm not seeing
any other women.

41:39.630 --> 41:41.164
You've married every
woman you've ever fucked.

41:41.166 --> 41:42.166
You just never knew it.

41:42.566 --> 41:43.500
Audrey.

41:43.502 --> 41:44.200
Audrey, I...

41:44.202 --> 41:45.268
I really...
Hey...

41:45.270 --> 41:46.703
Really care about you.

41:46.705 --> 41:47.837
Hey.

41:47.839 --> 41:48.705
Hey!

41:48.707 --> 41:48.705
Hey, what the fuck, man?

41:48.707 --> 41:51.274
Whatever you two do
have is ending tonight.

41:51.276 --> 41:52.842
Don't you fucking
touch me, Eric!

41:53.277 --> 41:55.245
Audrey's my wife and
you're fucking done with her.

41:55.247 --> 41:56.679
It's not up to you, Eric.

41:56.681 --> 41:57.780
This is my choice.

41:57.782 --> 42:00.917
You can't just decide that the
last five years didn't happen.

42:01.519 --> 42:04.888
God, where was this man
when Jesse whitehall

42:04.890 --> 42:06.256
wouldn't leave me alone?

42:07.391 --> 42:10.560
Where was this man when I
was pleading with you to go to

42:10.562 --> 42:11.562
counseling?

42:14.865 --> 42:15.865
It's too late.

42:18.536 --> 42:24.807
I'm sorry that this happened,
Eric, but I don't love you

42:24.809 --> 42:25.809
anymore.

42:54.173 --> 42:55.072
Why...

42:55.073 --> 42:56.073
Why...

42:56.774 --> 42:58.608
Why did you just
cancel my route?

42:59.143 --> 42:59.142
I'm...

42:59.144 --> 43:00.977
I'm not paying for shit.

43:00.979 --> 43:01.844
This ride's free.

43:01.846 --> 43:05.248
You need to turn this car around
and take us back to the city,

43:05.250 --> 43:06.015
right now, or I'm...

43:06.017 --> 43:06.015
I'm...

43:06.017 --> 43:06.015
I'm gonna report
you, you'll nev-...

43:06.017 --> 43:08.885
Youll never work
in this town again.

43:08.887 --> 43:10.954
And then, I'm gonna call
the police and report you for

43:10.956 --> 43:11.788
fucking kidnapping.

43:11.922 --> 43:11.921
Go ahead.

43:11.923 --> 43:16.025
You got in the car voluntarily,
you can get out voluntarily.

43:16.827 --> 43:18.227
Stop the fucking car, Eric.

43:22.533 --> 43:23.766
Oh, what are you gonna do?

43:24.034 --> 43:24.033
Jesus Christ.

43:24.035 --> 43:24.033
You gonna shoot somebody?

43:24.035 --> 43:27.036
No, I'm trying to make
sure that you won't.

43:27.038 --> 43:28.038
Jesus.

43:32.076 --> 43:33.743
Maybe we should
talk about separating.

43:34.678 --> 43:37.313
Audrey, we can go to counseling.

43:38.182 --> 43:39.182
We're past that.

43:40.618 --> 43:43.186
You're not happy and I
can't make you happy.

43:44.254 --> 43:45.121
I...

43:45.123 --> 43:48.124
I think you should just
take that job in Atlanta.

43:48.126 --> 43:48.124
Please...

43:48.126 --> 43:49.559
Let's just take a break...

43:49.561 --> 43:49.559
No.

43:49.561 --> 43:51.060
Hello? Yes... don't
do th-...

43:51.062 --> 43:51.060
I'm in a cab.

43:51.062 --> 43:54.030
Uh, the driver's
name is Eric Hollister.

43:54.032 --> 43:54.764
You see this?

43:54.766 --> 43:55.531
And he's not...

43:55.533 --> 43:56.466
He's refusing to let me...

43:56.468 --> 43:57.934
Is that you want to be with?

43:57.936 --> 43:57.934
Out and...

43:57.936 --> 43:57.934
Or take me to my destination.

43:57.936 --> 44:01.304
Gotta call the cops to handle
his shit, when he can't even

44:01.306 --> 44:02.605
deal with me like a real man.

44:02.607 --> 44:04.007
I... I... I...
Hey, tell them you're...

44:04.009 --> 44:05.875
You're with the woman you're
sleeping with and her husband,

44:05.877 --> 44:06.976
see what they say about that.

44:06.978 --> 44:08.511
I believe he has a
gun in the car...

44:08.513 --> 44:09.245
Get off the phone...

44:09.247 --> 44:10.546
And my life may be in danger.

44:10.548 --> 44:12.548
Yeah, tell them which one of
us is actually threatening the

44:12.550 --> 44:13.116
other physical harm.

44:13.118 --> 44:13.783
No, I...

44:13.785 --> 44:13.783
I...

44:13.785 --> 44:15.785
I don't have...
Give them to me...

44:15.787 --> 44:17.253
That information...
I'll talk to 'em.

44:17.255 --> 44:18.488
Get off the phone!
No, listen...

44:18.490 --> 44:19.288
I'll talk to them.

44:19.290 --> 44:20.323
What, you can't do anything?

44:20.325 --> 44:21.024
Nope, they're not.

44:21.026 --> 44:21.491
Oh, that...

44:21.493 --> 44:21.491
That...

44:21.493 --> 44:22.993
That's great, detectives.

44:23.194 --> 44:24.327
God dammit.

44:26.363 --> 44:28.364
So, what are we
gonna do, huh, Eric?

44:28.766 --> 44:31.267
We're gonna drive around all
night and talk, talk about your

44:31.269 --> 44:33.770
feelings and then may be what,
sing saying "kumbayah" at the

44:33.772 --> 44:34.772
end or some-...?

44:35.040 --> 44:41.110
Look, I will leave
Audrey alone, all right?

44:41.112 --> 44:42.078
All right? I... I...

44:42.080 --> 44:43.946
I'm sorry I met you, okay?

44:43.948 --> 44:45.081
I said I was sorry.

44:45.215 --> 44:45.214
I'm...

44:45.216 --> 44:48.317
I'm sorry that I like
your wife, all right?

44:49.853 --> 44:51.120
I never meant to hurt anybody.

44:53.357 --> 44:54.357
Patrick.

44:56.794 --> 44:57.827
Are there other women?

44:57.829 --> 44:58.261
Stop.

44:58.263 --> 44:59.263
Stop.

44:59.830 --> 45:01.831
Audrey, forget
about him, please.

45:01.833 --> 45:03.733
I think you should
go to Atlanta, Eric.

45:03.735 --> 45:04.735
No.

45:05.169 --> 45:06.169
You're my wife.

45:06.336 --> 45:08.838
Let me try again.

45:09.073 --> 45:11.174
I want to be with Patrick.

45:11.176 --> 45:12.108
No!

45:12.110 --> 45:13.710
He's not good enough for you.

45:15.045 --> 45:16.846
I can start over.

45:16.980 --> 45:18.448
I don't love you anymore.

45:18.450 --> 45:20.783
You don't know what love is.

45:20.951 --> 45:23.486
It's not the affection
that you used to feel for me.

45:23.488 --> 45:24.987
That's a parody, okay?

45:24.989 --> 45:26.089
What are you talking about?

45:26.256 --> 45:27.990
My good is my good,
your good is yours.

45:27.992 --> 45:27.990
What...

45:27.992 --> 45:27.990
You're not making any sense...

45:27.992 --> 45:30.359
One gains, another loses.

45:30.361 --> 45:32.462
Audrey, maybe we shouldn't
see each other anymore.

45:32.830 --> 45:33.529
What?

45:33.531 --> 45:34.263
There it is.

45:34.265 --> 45:35.832
There's the
coward I met earlier.

45:35.834 --> 45:35.832
You know?

45:35.834 --> 45:38.234
Just at least till you
guys work this shit out.

45:38.402 --> 45:38.401
We're...

45:38.403 --> 45:40.269
We're done working this out.

45:40.271 --> 45:40.269
We're separating.

45:40.271 --> 45:43.206
You know he tried to take
me to a strip club earlier?

45:43.208 --> 45:44.707
What-what do you
want from me, Eric?

45:44.709 --> 45:44.707
Huh?

45:44.709 --> 45:45.942
You won, okay?

45:45.944 --> 45:46.909
I'll leave your wife alone.

45:46.911 --> 45:47.343
No.

45:47.345 --> 45:47.977
Patrick.

45:47.979 --> 45:49.112
Fuck you, I'm a coward.

45:49.114 --> 45:52.949
You just can't bring yourself
to tell her the truth, Patrick,

45:53.083 --> 45:54.450
that you are done with her.

45:55.385 --> 45:56.486
You don't love her.

45:56.854 --> 45:59.288
You never have
and you never will.

45:59.523 --> 46:02.425
'Cause guys like you, you get
married when it's hot, but then

46:02.427 --> 46:04.026
you leave your
wives when it's cold.

46:04.294 --> 46:09.499
Guys like you don't
fight, you fucking roll over.

46:09.501 --> 46:10.967
Look, I'm done discussing this.

46:12.803 --> 46:14.483
I got to thank you, Patrick.

46:16.273 --> 46:23.479
It took me meeting you to remind
myself that I'm a good man and

46:23.481 --> 46:25.014
I'm worthy of Audrey.

46:25.016 --> 46:26.016
Go fuck yourself.

46:28.285 --> 46:29.285
That's fitting.

46:29.820 --> 46:31.854
Your only retort
is a sexual one.

46:33.490 --> 46:37.960
Maybe this whole night was just
a set-up from the beginning.

46:41.932 --> 46:44.292
Maybe this whole night was just
a set-up from the beginning.

46:48.872 --> 46:49.872
So, is that it?

46:50.207 --> 46:51.207
Are we done?

46:59.016 --> 47:00.016
I hate you.

47:24.107 --> 47:25.274
Where the hell are we?

47:26.443 --> 47:27.443
Huh?

47:31.949 --> 47:32.989
Where are you going, Eric?

47:33.817 --> 47:36.485
My good is my good
and your good is yours.

47:37.054 --> 47:38.221
Where are you taking us?

47:38.989 --> 47:40.456
What one gains, another loses.

47:41.325 --> 47:42.558
Where are you taking us?

47:43.393 --> 47:45.628
Stop the fucking car before
I break your goddamn neck.

47:46.029 --> 47:46.028
Go ahead, tough guy.

47:46.030 --> 47:49.165
We can crash the car
and all go together.

47:49.433 --> 47:50.266
Eric.

47:50.268 --> 47:51.400
You're... you're
nuts.

47:51.402 --> 47:52.602
Wormwood's a fucking liar.

47:54.137 --> 47:56.072
Eric, let's just go home.

47:58.242 --> 47:59.342
Come on, stop the car, Eric.

47:59.344 --> 47:59.342
Let's just...

47:59.344 --> 48:00.877
Let's just go home.

48:01.111 --> 48:02.278
We can go to counseling.

48:02.479 --> 48:03.980
I won't see Patrick anymore.
Look, I...

48:03.982 --> 48:05.448
I won't see her anymore, Eric.
Eric.

48:05.450 --> 48:06.782
You're going a little fast, man.

48:07.351 --> 48:07.350
Eric?

48:07.352 --> 48:09.151
Eric, you're scaring me.
Stop the car!

48:09.153 --> 48:09.986
Hey, slow down, man.

48:09.988 --> 48:11.087
You're going too fast.

48:11.089 --> 48:11.654
Honey. Sweetie.

48:11.656 --> 48:12.321
Slow down!

48:12.323 --> 48:14.123
You're scaring me!
Watch out!

48:33.144 --> 48:34.144
What the fuck?

48:40.217 --> 48:41.217
What is it?

48:45.989 --> 48:46.989
Eric?

48:48.325 --> 48:49.325
What is that?

48:59.636 --> 49:02.171
Should we m-...

49:02.539 --> 49:03.973
Shouldn't we make
sure he's okay?

49:08.278 --> 49:09.612
Eric, make sure he's okay.

49:12.382 --> 49:13.649
I don't think he's okay.

49:14.217 --> 49:15.284
Do something.

49:17.487 --> 49:18.487
I'll go.

49:19.323 --> 49:21.290
Open up the fucking door, Eric.

49:34.137 --> 49:35.671
Why is there a body in the road?

49:38.175 --> 49:39.909
Maybe he just, like, passed out.

49:39.911 --> 49:42.311
I don't know, maybe
he got hit by a car.

49:43.146 --> 49:44.146
I'm sure it's fine.

49:45.549 --> 49:46.682
Where are we?

49:46.684 --> 49:47.684
What were you thinking?

49:48.352 --> 49:49.385
We're not far, okay?

49:49.387 --> 49:50.753
We're just outside of Chester.

49:53.390 --> 49:54.991
I don't know, I just...

49:56.393 --> 49:57.360
What?

49:57.362 --> 49:58.362
You just what?

49:58.795 --> 50:00.029
You're acting like a maniac.

50:29.993 --> 50:30.993
Oh, my god.

50:31.661 --> 50:31.660
Calm down.

50:31.662 --> 50:34.130
Wait, he probably
knows this person.

50:35.165 --> 50:36.298
Turn around, Patrick.

50:36.433 --> 50:37.566
Calm down.

50:37.568 --> 50:38.568
It's fine.

50:43.306 --> 50:44.306
See?

50:49.882 --> 50:50.781
Oh!

50:50.782 --> 50:52.314
Holy fuck!

50:52.516 --> 50:53.516
Oh, my god!

50:53.617 --> 50:54.617
What happened?

50:57.621 --> 50:58.220
Eric?

50:58.222 --> 50:59.222
Stay here.

50:59.356 --> 50:59.355
What-...?

50:59.357 --> 51:01.257
Should I call the police?

51:01.425 --> 51:02.324
No!

51:02.326 --> 51:03.326
Why not?

52:20.905 --> 52:21.905
Eric!

52:24.474 --> 52:25.741
Eric!

52:29.514 --> 52:30.880
Oh, Jesus. Oh,
Jesus.

52:31.248 --> 52:31.814
Oh, god.

52:32.015 --> 52:33.015
Oh, my god.

53:17.794 --> 53:18.794
Shit.

54:22.692 --> 54:24.293
Hello?

54:24.295 --> 54:25.828
Yeah, I'm, uh...

54:25.830 --> 54:26.729
I'm in my...

54:26.731 --> 54:28.864
I'm in my car
somewhere outside of Chester.

54:29.000 --> 54:29.899
I don't...

54:29.900 --> 54:31.367
I don't know where.

54:31.968 --> 54:31.967
I...

54:31.969 --> 54:34.470
I heard gunshots.

54:34.473 --> 54:35.372
I'm...

54:35.373 --> 54:37.306
I'm afraid
somebody has been shot.

54:38.875 --> 54:39.875
I don't know.

54:40.343 --> 54:40.342
I'm...

54:40.344 --> 54:41.944
I'm looking for my husband.

54:42.579 --> 54:42.578
I don't...

54:42.580 --> 54:44.446
I don't know where he is.

54:46.651 --> 54:47.383
No.
No, no, no.

54:47.385 --> 54:48.550
I ca-...
I can't stay here.

54:48.552 --> 54:49.752
I g-...
I need to leave.

54:53.690 --> 54:54.690
There he is.

55:00.430 --> 55:01.430
Eric.

55:02.866 --> 55:03.932
Eric, get in the car.

55:07.504 --> 55:08.504
Eric, get in.

55:09.572 --> 55:10.572
I saw their faces.

55:10.807 --> 55:11.974
Please, get in the car.

55:13.510 --> 55:14.510
I saw his face.

55:15.814 --> 55:16.713
Please.

55:16.714 --> 55:18.480
I've got the
police on the phone.

55:18.482 --> 55:20.249
Just get in and
we'll go to them.

55:32.662 --> 55:33.662
Here, take it.

55:33.930 --> 55:34.930
Tell them what happened.

55:36.499 --> 55:37.599
Hello?

55:37.601 --> 55:38.601
Hello...?

55:39.002 --> 55:39.768
They hung up.

55:39.969 --> 55:40.969
What?

55:41.071 --> 55:42.071
Call them back.

55:48.078 --> 55:49.078
Where's Patrick?

55:49.479 --> 55:50.479
Hello?

55:53.049 --> 55:54.049
They're not answering.

55:56.419 --> 55:57.419
Hello?

55:58.588 --> 55:59.588
They're not answering.

56:00.958 --> 56:02.725
Um, go.

56:02.727 --> 56:03.726
Just go.

56:03.728 --> 56:03.726
Just... we'll...

56:03.728 --> 56:05.561
We'll keep...
We can drive there.

56:05.563 --> 56:05.561
Well...

56:05.563 --> 56:06.595
Just stay straight.

56:06.597 --> 56:07.597
Where do I go?

56:07.731 --> 56:08.731
This will, uh...

56:08.965 --> 56:10.366
Just turn on 183.

56:11.301 --> 56:11.300
What about Patrick?

56:11.302 --> 56:14.069
We need to go back and
make sure he's okay.

56:14.604 --> 56:15.637
I saw...

56:15.639 --> 56:16.639
I their faces.

56:18.141 --> 56:19.141
Who were they?

56:20.610 --> 56:21.610
I saw his face.

56:23.646 --> 56:24.413
Oh.

56:24.415 --> 56:26.115
What about Patrick?
We need to...

56:26.584 --> 56:29.218
I saw his face.
We need to make sure he's okay.

56:29.220 --> 56:31.420
I saw his face.
We need to go back for Patrick.

56:31.422 --> 56:33.088
I saw his face.
I saw his face.

56:33.090 --> 56:34.090
Eric, where's Patrick?

56:42.432 --> 56:43.432
Patrick's dead.

56:43.867 --> 56:44.633
What?

56:44.801 --> 56:45.801
What?

56:46.102 --> 56:46.902
Are you sure?

56:46.904 --> 56:46.902
Did...

56:46.904 --> 56:48.137
Did you see him?

56:48.139 --> 56:49.139
He's dead.

56:50.807 --> 56:51.540
Did you see him?

56:51.542 --> 56:52.608
Patrick's dead.

56:54.978 --> 57:01.784
Patrick's fucking dead. Your
fucking boyfriend is dead.

57:07.023 --> 57:08.957
Did you want it to be me?

57:13.096 --> 57:14.630
Do you wish it was me?

57:31.781 --> 57:32.781
I'm sorry.

57:34.017 --> 57:35.017
I'm sorry.

57:38.221 --> 57:39.221
I'm sorry.

57:43.526 --> 57:44.526
I'm sorry he's dead.

57:44.661 --> 57:45.661
I'm sorry he's dead.

57:46.095 --> 57:47.629
He's dead and it's my fault.

58:01.010 --> 58:03.879
I'm sorry... I'm
sorry he's dead.

58:04.180 --> 58:05.848
It's my fault.

58:25.869 --> 58:28.237
Just go straight
until we hit 183.

58:28.438 --> 58:29.805
We'll go to the police station.

58:35.211 --> 58:36.211
I'm sorry.

58:39.816 --> 58:40.816
I'm sorry.

58:41.184 --> 58:41.850
I'm sorry.

58:42.085 --> 58:43.085
I'm sorry.

58:44.554 --> 58:45.487
I'm sorry I said that.

58:45.489 --> 58:46.522
I'm sorry I said that.

58:51.861 --> 58:53.128
I'm sorry he's dead.

58:53.130 --> 58:54.130
I'm sorry he's...

59:09.045 --> 59:10.045
When did...

59:12.849 --> 59:14.116
How long is...

59:17.153 --> 59:18.654
How long have you been together?

59:25.762 --> 59:26.762
We met in march.

59:27.697 --> 59:29.031
That's not what I asked you.

59:29.033 --> 59:30.699
How long have you been together?

59:31.935 --> 59:32.935
Eric...

59:35.805 --> 59:37.239
Can you just please tell me?

59:41.811 --> 59:42.811
Since may.

59:44.581 --> 59:45.581
May?

59:51.220 --> 59:55.757
What, did you meet
him at a showing?

59:57.894 --> 59:58.894
Yeah.

01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:05.200
Do you love him?

01:00:12.342 --> 01:00:13.342
No.

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:18.780
Not like you,
when we got married.

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:28.090
We were young.

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:38.834
I'm sorry.

01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:41.236
Eric, it's o-...

01:00:41.671 --> 01:00:43.238
It's okay to say that we tried.

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:51.380
I didn't try.

01:00:55.153 --> 01:00:56.052
I didn't...

01:00:56.053 --> 01:00:57.486
I didn't even know.

01:01:09.165 --> 01:01:10.932
Did you mean
what you said to me?

01:01:15.138 --> 01:01:16.872
Do you remember
what you said to me?

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:25.047
Do you not love me?

01:01:35.024 --> 01:01:38.960
Do you know what it was like
to hear you say that to me?

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:48.470
Do you hate me?

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:50.706
No.

01:01:52.809 --> 01:01:53.809
I don't hate you.

01:01:56.045 --> 01:01:57.045
That wasn't to you.

01:02:01.853 --> 01:02:02.752
Do you...

01:02:02.753 --> 01:02:04.152
Do you love me?

01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:10.292
Do you want a divorce?

01:02:15.098 --> 01:02:16.765
Tell me if you want a divorce.

01:02:17.333 --> 01:02:18.967
Tell me if that's what you want.

01:02:22.972 --> 01:02:26.742
I will take the job in Atlanta
if that is what you want,

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:32.147
if you want a divorce.

01:02:35.918 --> 01:02:39.454
But you have to tell me
that's what you want.

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:45.427
I loved you.

01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:53.101
We just...

01:02:55.138 --> 01:02:56.238
We're not who we were.

01:03:09.152 --> 01:03:10.218
Are you ready to quit?

01:03:20.863 --> 01:03:21.863
You're done?

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:24.933
No.

01:03:24.935 --> 01:03:29.905
Do you remember the beach
trip we took with mark and Kim?

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:34.943
That was when I knew.

01:03:39.015 --> 01:03:41.316
And I thought I would do
anything to make you happy,

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:49.291
to love her well.

01:03:51.394 --> 01:03:52.394
You.

01:03:52.929 --> 01:03:53.929
To love you well.

01:03:57.466 --> 01:03:59.501
And this is part of that fight.

01:04:02.004 --> 01:04:03.004
Don't give up.

01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:06.208
Don't give up.

01:04:08.444 --> 01:04:10.145
Love doesn't die.

01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:13.448
It just waits.

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:17.853
Hey.

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:18.954
It's not dead.

01:04:20.056 --> 01:04:21.056
It's not dead.

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:24.059
Don't let it die.

01:04:25.595 --> 01:04:27.596
I'm ready to love you better.

01:04:31.267 --> 01:04:32.427
I'm ready to love you better.

01:04:35.471 --> 01:04:37.873
Can we try again?

01:04:42.046 --> 01:04:42.945
Audrey.

01:04:42.946 --> 01:04:47.582
Audrey, can we try again?

01:04:49.218 --> 01:04:50.218
Please.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:54.256
Eric, that car is close.

01:04:58.294 --> 01:04:59.294
Oh, Jesus.

01:05:00.129 --> 01:05:01.129
Are they following us?

01:05:03.499 --> 01:05:04.499
I didn't see a car.

01:05:04.501 --> 01:05:05.501
I don't know.
Jesus.

01:05:07.169 --> 01:05:07.769
Eric, is that them?

01:05:07.771 --> 01:05:08.771
Where are we?

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:10.739
Did you turn?

01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:12.641
No.

01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:14.576
You said to stay straight.

01:05:14.944 --> 01:05:17.045
If you don't turn
you'll hit 183.

01:05:17.047 --> 01:05:17.946
You said stay straight.

01:05:17.948 --> 01:05:19.080
Just keep going straight.

01:05:20.082 --> 01:05:21.116
Shit.

01:05:22.018 --> 01:05:23.051
Fuck.

01:05:23.053 --> 01:05:23.051
Call...

01:05:23.053 --> 01:05:24.452
Call the police again.

01:05:29.659 --> 01:05:30.659
Hello.

01:05:30.693 --> 01:05:31.393
Hi.

01:05:31.395 --> 01:05:32.327
Um, yes.

01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:34.262
Uh, we called you
once before, okay?

01:05:34.363 --> 01:05:35.964
We're off 183...

01:05:36.132 --> 01:05:36.131
Fuck!

01:05:36.133 --> 01:05:37.265
Shit!

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:39.534
Um, yes.
Okay, I'm holding on.

01:05:39.536 --> 01:05:41.069
Please, we're being attacked.

01:05:41.337 --> 01:05:42.504
We're being attacked, yes.

01:05:43.072 --> 01:05:44.105
Okay.

01:05:44.107 --> 01:05:46.107
Just go, okay.

01:05:46.344 --> 01:05:47.243
Fuck!

01:05:47.244 --> 01:05:48.443
Look out!

01:05:48.544 --> 01:05:49.544
Look out!

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:51.446
Fuck!

01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.582
Oh, god.

01:05:54.584 --> 01:05:55.150
Go.

01:05:55.152 --> 01:05:55.550
Go.

01:05:55.552 --> 01:05:56.284
Go!

01:05:56.419 --> 01:05:57.419
Go!

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.120
Go.

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:00.122
We're stuck.

01:06:01.124 --> 01:06:02.124
Go!

01:06:02.659 --> 01:06:03.959
I'm trying.

01:06:04.293 --> 01:06:05.493
We're stuck.

01:06:15.905 --> 01:06:16.905
It's okay.

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.440
It's okay.

01:06:19.375 --> 01:06:20.141
Oh, god.

01:06:20.343 --> 01:06:21.343
Don't open the door.

01:06:25.581 --> 01:06:26.581
What the fuck?

01:06:29.585 --> 01:06:30.118
It's okay.

01:06:30.419 --> 01:06:31.453
It's okay.

01:06:31.455 --> 01:06:31.453
Oh, no.

01:06:31.455 --> 01:06:32.721
It's okay.

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:36.491
Oh, my god.
Oh, fuck.

01:06:37.426 --> 01:06:38.426
Oh, shit.

01:06:38.694 --> 01:06:39.694
Oh, god.

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:49.771
You take one fucking step
toward me and I'm gonna blow

01:06:49.773 --> 01:06:51.773
that hood the hell right
out off your fucking face.

01:07:04.453 --> 01:07:05.620
Wha-... what?

01:07:05.622 --> 01:07:07.255
Don't look at him.
Don't look at him.

01:07:07.257 --> 01:07:08.923
Don't look at him.

01:07:08.925 --> 01:07:08.923
What is happening?

01:07:08.925 --> 01:07:10.625
Don't look.
Don't look.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:11.960
Don't look.

01:07:14.797 --> 01:07:15.463
No!

01:07:15.765 --> 01:07:16.498
No!

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:17.332
No!

01:07:17.334 --> 01:07:18.334
No!

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:19.567
No!

01:07:23.072 --> 01:07:23.605

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:25.240
No!

01:07:25.374 --> 01:07:26.374
No!

01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:28.109
Audrey!

01:07:28.244 --> 01:07:30.745
No! No! Eric! No!

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:32.080
Audrey!

01:07:32.748 --> 01:07:34.049
Fuck you cowards!

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:35.550
Fight me!

01:07:35.584 --> 01:07:36.584
Fight me!

01:07:36.685 --> 01:07:37.685
Ah!

01:07:41.757 --> 01:07:42.757
No!

01:07:43.093 --> 01:07:43.625
No!

01:07:43.627 --> 01:07:44.492
Get off of me!

01:07:44.627 --> 01:07:45.427
Eric, help!

01:07:45.429 --> 01:07:46.194
No!

01:07:46.328 --> 01:07:46.795
No!

01:07:47.096 --> 01:07:48.096
No!

01:07:48.164 --> 01:07:48.630
Get off!

01:07:49.098 --> 01:07:50.098
No!

01:07:50.232 --> 01:07:51.232
Audrey!

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:53.535
Fuck you cowards!

01:07:55.771 --> 01:07:56.538
No!

01:07:56.772 --> 01:07:58.473
Audrey, fight them!

01:07:59.141 --> 01:08:00.141
Fight them, Audrey!

01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:02.110
Get your fucking
hands off of me.

01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:09.084
Shoot him!

01:08:09.118 --> 01:08:09.117
I can't!

01:08:09.119 --> 01:08:10.351
You're in the way!

01:08:10.519 --> 01:08:11.686
Get out of the way!

01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:14.190
No!

01:08:15.424 --> 01:08:16.424
Eric! Do it!

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:19.493
Go!

01:08:19.496 --> 01:08:19.828
Go!

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:21.095
Go!

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:24.832
Go.

01:08:24.835 --> 01:08:25.835
Go.

01:08:29.604 --> 01:08:30.604
They're not moving.

01:08:31.573 --> 01:08:32.573
They're not moving.

01:08:34.042 --> 01:08:34.776
They're not moving.

01:08:34.778 --> 01:08:36.377
Oh, my god.

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:37.645
Oh, my...

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:38.880
They're...

01:08:39.348 --> 01:08:40.482
They're not...

01:08:42.252 --> 01:08:43.184
What?

01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:45.587
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

01:08:45.589 --> 01:08:46.386
Are you okay?

01:08:46.389 --> 01:08:47.455
I'm okay.

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:48.656
I'm okay.

01:08:48.658 --> 01:08:50.291
Oh, god.
Oh, my god.

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:51.693
I'm okay. Oh,
my god.

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:51.693
Eric. Just... just
go straight.

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:55.130
Just go straight,
just till we hit 183.

01:08:55.564 --> 01:08:56.564
Take a right.

01:08:57.301 --> 01:08:58.200
Eric...

01:08:58.201 --> 01:08:59.200
Just keep going.

01:08:59.202 --> 01:08:59.868
Stay with me.

01:09:00.102 --> 01:09:00.100
Audrey.

01:09:00.103 --> 01:09:01.336
Stay with me.

01:09:01.337 --> 01:09:02.170
Audrey.

01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:05.240
Hey, I'm not dying.

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:07.810
Don't leave me.

01:09:07.843 --> 01:09:10.145
Audrey, I'm not gonna die.

01:09:11.647 --> 01:09:12.647
Just let me rest.

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:15.216
Please stay with me.

01:09:15.584 --> 01:09:17.385
I'm not gonna die, Audrey.

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:18.819
Please stay with me.

01:09:19.287 --> 01:09:20.287
Don't leave me.

01:09:20.656 --> 01:09:21.656
I love you.

01:09:22.024 --> 01:09:23.024
I love you.

01:09:24.026 --> 01:09:25.193
I just need a moment.

01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:50.919
Stay with me.

01:10:28.991 --> 01:10:29.991
