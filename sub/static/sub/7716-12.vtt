WEBVTT

00:10.261 --> 00:12.180
Oh... Oh...

00:13.598 --> 00:14.599
What is this?

00:15.684 --> 00:19.145
A meatball? Really?

00:20.146 --> 00:22.357
It's always more fun to mess
with Dwight with an audience.

00:22.440 --> 00:23.817
That was usually Pam.

00:23.900 --> 00:26.111
So now that she's out,
I had to find someone else.

00:27.320 --> 00:30.365
Turns out that Stanley
is quite the comedy fan.

00:32.117 --> 00:34.244
But not everything
makes him laugh.

00:35.704 --> 00:37.706
He has very specific tastes.

00:40.792 --> 00:44.754
Through a painstaking process of trial
and error, I found out what he likes.

00:46.589 --> 00:47.799
And it's really weird.

00:48.425 --> 00:50.885
Jim, come on. So juvenile.

00:52.137 --> 00:53.346
What the...

00:53.471 --> 00:55.473
You've been meatballed.

00:56.307 --> 00:58.685
Are you ready
for some meatballs?

00:58.768 --> 00:59.978
Oh, man!

01:00.937 --> 01:02.313
This is not very clever, Jim.

01:02.689 --> 01:04.607
I know.
Look for your stapler.

01:09.362 --> 01:11.072
Really, Jim? Really?

01:13.658 --> 01:14.826
Very funny.

01:16.619 --> 01:17.954
Okay, good night.

01:30.341 --> 01:31.509
What's the haul?

01:32.010 --> 01:33.303
Thirty-two meatballs.

01:33.470 --> 01:35.555
Good day.

01:35.638 --> 01:37.599
That idiot's been
feeding us for a week.

01:37.682 --> 01:39.768
We'll never have to
buy meatballs again.

02:05.210 --> 02:06.211
Dunder Mifflin.

02:07.545 --> 02:09.047
Jessica, hi, how are you?

02:09.714 --> 02:11.299
Yay, that's so great to hear.

02:11.382 --> 02:13.593
I'm not going to be one of
those exes who can't move on.

02:14.010 --> 02:15.804
They have their
life and I have mine.

02:16.221 --> 02:17.764
I'm taking an Italian class.

02:17.847 --> 02:22.685
So far, I have learned tortellini,
spaghettini, linguine.

02:23.311 --> 02:25.313
Well, it's not so much
a class as a restaurant.

02:25.396 --> 02:28.066
But I do Monday, Wednesday,
Friday from 7:00 to 9:00.

02:28.775 --> 02:30.109
I will patch you
through right now.

02:30.902 --> 02:33.071
You sound really
pretty today. Okay.

02:37.242 --> 02:39.285
Jessica, I love you.

02:40.245 --> 02:41.496
That's a message from my mom.

02:42.038 --> 02:45.250
My parents met Jessica, and they
completely flipped for her so,

02:46.084 --> 02:48.044
they gave me this old
family ring to use on her.

02:48.127 --> 02:50.088
I know. Whoa.
Pump the brakes, Bernard.

02:50.171 --> 02:52.590
Too early, I get it.
I just... You know,

02:53.132 --> 02:55.009
I'm just carrying it around,
seeing how it feels.

02:55.093 --> 02:57.345
I haven't proposed
to anyone in years.

02:58.555 --> 03:00.807
Mom took the main diamond out.
She thought that had more of a

03:00.890 --> 03:03.101
"my little brother"
kind of vibe to it. But...

03:04.894 --> 03:06.312
Whoa. It's pretty nice.

03:06.396 --> 03:08.231
Got a little bit of
The Shining vibe, though.

03:08.314 --> 03:09.732
Who needs a house that size?

03:09.899 --> 03:12.026
Big, stupid, pure chump bait.

03:12.110 --> 03:13.778
I'm selling the house,
actually.

03:14.279 --> 03:16.030
No, there's
a glare from over here.

03:16.573 --> 03:18.116
Oh, wow, that's magnificent.

03:18.783 --> 03:22.161
It's mid-recession in a depressed
area of a faltering state,

03:22.245 --> 03:24.497
and I've got the most expensive
house on the market.

03:24.581 --> 03:26.583
The 1% are
suffering too, people.

03:27.458 --> 03:29.961
I bought it to be
my Playboy Mansion.

03:30.420 --> 03:34.465
A temple to wine,
revelry, sex, intrigue.

03:34.549 --> 03:37.719
This was hot on the heels of
Eyes Wide Shut, mind you.

03:38.261 --> 03:41.556
Then I met my wife,
she moved in, made it her own.

03:41.806 --> 03:44.309
Now she's left me and forced
me to sell the place.

03:44.767 --> 03:46.352
The ultimate insult,
they're calling

03:46.477 --> 03:48.146
my speakeasy
lounge a rumpus room.

03:50.607 --> 03:53.067
Does my turmoil
amuse you, Jim?

03:53.985 --> 03:55.528
I'm sorry. I thought
you were making a joke.

03:55.612 --> 03:59.115
What could you possibly have
found funny in what I said?

03:59.198 --> 04:01.326
What was the joke
you thought you heard?

04:03.620 --> 04:05.872
I guess I thought
you were approaching it

04:05.997 --> 04:08.333
with more of
a sarcasm than misery.

04:09.167 --> 04:11.878
Kind of laughing
at your own pain.

04:12.253 --> 04:13.588
Sad clown thing.

04:13.671 --> 04:16.799
Oh, yes. How hilarious it is,

04:17.175 --> 04:21.512
to laugh at clowns, the painted
jesters of a dying circus industry.

04:21.763 --> 04:23.097
Very funny, Jim. I get it.

04:23.765 --> 04:28.561
Um, I'm getting reports of a serious
outbreak of the "grumpies" in here.

04:29.103 --> 04:34.150
A beautiful monster cost me
my 40s and my dream home.

04:34.233 --> 04:37.946
I think I'm entitled to
the occasional bad day.

04:38.404 --> 04:40.615
Well, please tell
Susan we all say hi.

04:41.074 --> 04:44.202
Dude, what if,
since you're feeling grumpy,

04:44.327 --> 04:47.413
we all swing by
tonight and check out

04:47.497 --> 04:48.915
your indoor pool?
Kevin, no.

04:49.624 --> 04:51.209
Like some sort
of last hurrah?

04:51.584 --> 04:54.921
Yeah. All of us in the pool,
saying hurrah.

04:55.046 --> 04:57.840
Maybe the last one
that says hurrah is "it."

04:58.549 --> 05:01.803
Well, I suppose someone
should enjoy the place

05:01.886 --> 05:05.515
before I hand it over to the staging
experts at RE/MAX tomorrow.

05:05.598 --> 05:06.683
Let's try this.

05:06.766 --> 05:09.686
Everyone, tonight, my house,
wear a swimsuit.

05:09.811 --> 05:11.521
Let's just call
it a get-together.

05:11.604 --> 05:13.147
And let's say no food.

05:14.065 --> 05:17.443
Hey, Oscar, was
that you who just

05:17.568 --> 05:20.989
created a party out of
thin air or was it me?

05:21.072 --> 05:22.240
That was you, Kevin.

05:22.407 --> 05:23.574
It was me.

05:24.033 --> 05:26.285
You going tonight, kiddo?
Because I can give you a lift.

05:26.369 --> 05:27.829
Oh, I don't know,
Meredith, it seems like

05:27.954 --> 05:29.414
you shouldn't drive,
maybe ever.

05:29.789 --> 05:31.708
It's no problem.
You live right near me.

05:31.791 --> 05:32.792
How do you know
where I live?

05:33.126 --> 05:35.086
Andy followed you home
after the Christmas party.

05:36.004 --> 05:37.005
Why?

05:37.088 --> 05:38.965
He wanted to make sure
California didn't put it in you.

05:39.257 --> 05:40.258
Oh. Come on.

05:45.263 --> 05:47.682
Wow. Andy's such
a weird stalker.

05:47.765 --> 05:51.102
Following me home like that
when he has a girlfriend,

05:51.436 --> 05:53.604
I should get a restraining order.

05:55.565 --> 05:57.108
It is warm.

05:57.900 --> 05:58.943
It's almost too warm.

05:59.027 --> 06:02.071
I'm feeling 82, 82.5.

06:02.155 --> 06:04.198
Oh. So close. Eighty-one.

06:04.449 --> 06:07.618
Well, we'll say it's 82,
and it'll be our secret.

06:09.871 --> 06:11.372
Hey, late guy-
Hey.

06:12.206 --> 06:15.793
Wow. Just stopping by.
Got another party to go to.

06:16.961 --> 06:18.880
A wife and two kids at home party.
Oh.

06:18.963 --> 06:22.759
DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some
serious Radio Disney tonight.

06:23.760 --> 06:26.179
You're looking at the master
of leaving parties early.

06:26.471 --> 06:27.972
The key is you have to
make a strong impression,

06:28.056 --> 06:30.808
so you want to have a picture taken,
you want to say some peculiar

06:30.892 --> 06:32.852
non sequitur that
people remember,

06:32.935 --> 06:36.522
you want to note something unique,
a talking point for later.

06:37.273 --> 06:40.610
I don't mean to brag, but New
Year's Eve, I was home by 9:00.

06:41.652 --> 06:43.654
Robert, I just wanted to
grab you for one second.

06:43.738 --> 06:45.239
This place is amazing,
by the way.

06:45.323 --> 06:46.407
You should see
the whole thing.

06:46.491 --> 06:48.034
I bet I should.

06:50.286 --> 06:51.704
That's beautiful. I'm going
to e-mail that to you.

06:51.788 --> 06:53.039
I'm just about
to give the tour.

06:53.122 --> 06:54.415
All right. Well.
Join us.

06:54.499 --> 06:56.084
You must see what you
were laughing about.

06:56.834 --> 06:57.835
I must.

06:59.045 --> 07:00.254
Wow.

07:04.175 --> 07:06.677
Yeah, that's some
pretty serious poolage.

07:07.595 --> 07:08.971
What are you doing?
Hmm?

07:09.514 --> 07:11.349
Flicking a bug
off my weiner.

07:12.183 --> 07:13.184
Gross.

07:13.726 --> 07:14.977
I'm getting a drink.
Do you want anything?

07:15.061 --> 07:16.062
No, I'm good.

07:19.982 --> 07:24.028
Funny how you can be surrounded by
people and still feel so lonely.

07:24.946 --> 07:26.531
Hi.
Hi.

07:27.156 --> 07:29.659
How is everything?
How's your car?

07:30.535 --> 07:34.997
It's great, you know,
reliable, great mileage.

07:35.289 --> 07:36.290
Is that so?

07:36.582 --> 07:40.586
How about this weekend we take that
sucker to a duck pond or something?

07:41.045 --> 07:42.964
Maybe get caught in the rain.

07:44.674 --> 07:47.343
Well, I can't. I'm
going skiing with Jessica.

07:48.177 --> 07:49.846
Couple of dopes
on the slopes.

07:50.012 --> 07:51.347
Oh. Like a goodbye trip.

07:51.848 --> 07:53.766
No. What?

07:55.768 --> 07:56.811
Hey.
Hi.

07:56.894 --> 08:00.231
I guess Andy isn't totally
over his current girlfriend.

08:00.314 --> 08:01.983
But if he was
jealous once before,

08:02.108 --> 08:03.818
then maybe I can
make him jealous again.

08:03.901 --> 08:05.319
Just not with Robert.

08:05.403 --> 08:09.198
He told me he was a ride I wouldn't
survive, and I believe him.

08:10.116 --> 08:12.618
Wow. You made it.
Yeah. Yeah.

08:12.952 --> 08:17.832
Uh-oh. Look at this. Red
plastic cup, red plastic cup.

08:18.166 --> 08:19.333
How about that?

08:19.584 --> 08:21.752
You know, you are
just as dumb at night.

08:22.003 --> 08:23.004
Mmm.

08:24.172 --> 08:26.257
There is...
This would be no problem.

08:26.340 --> 08:27.967
I could swim under one breath!

08:28.050 --> 08:29.051
No! Show me.
All right.

08:29.135 --> 08:31.971
Dive in from here
right now. Okay.

08:34.432 --> 08:38.436
Hey, Dwight Snoot. What you doing?
Wait, relaxing. Scram.

08:38.603 --> 08:39.979
God.

08:40.104 --> 08:44.609
Hey, Stanley,
what happened to my pants?

08:44.692 --> 08:48.321
I moved them. Pants only need a
chair if there's a person in them.

08:55.536 --> 08:57.038
Come on,
don't you want to play?

08:57.496 --> 08:58.539
Oh, really?
Yeah.

08:58.623 --> 08:59.832
You want to play,
you little hick?

09:02.460 --> 09:03.544
Dwight!

09:03.628 --> 09:05.129
- Awesome!
- Dwight!

09:07.006 --> 09:08.299
Here we have
the parlor.

09:09.634 --> 09:12.136
I imagined people
would set down their coats

09:12.261 --> 09:14.805
and symbolically,
their inhibitions.

09:15.473 --> 09:17.475
This was the gateway.

09:17.934 --> 09:21.646
You enter this room a lawyer,
a doctor, a teacher, a judge,

09:22.188 --> 09:27.026
but beyond it, you are simply a
penis, a vagina, a hunger, an ache.

09:28.527 --> 09:30.529
Susan used it as
a Pilates studio.

09:30.613 --> 09:31.864
Holy cow.

09:32.823 --> 09:33.824
My wine collection.

09:34.408 --> 09:35.576
How many bottles?
Three hundred?

09:35.660 --> 09:36.911
About 1,200.

09:37.370 --> 09:38.829
What the hell,
grab a bottle.

09:39.163 --> 09:40.998
Less inventory
for the lawyers.

09:41.165 --> 09:43.251
Toby, ChÃ©teau Margaux, '95.

09:43.459 --> 09:44.543
You know your wine.

09:44.627 --> 09:50.675
Well. And you have a...
Yes, another chÃ¢teau.

09:51.342 --> 09:52.969
Robert, you are too kind.

09:53.177 --> 09:54.971
Oh... Too kind doesn't
begin to cover it.

09:55.221 --> 09:58.557
With ammunition like this, we are
in for quite a night, you and me.

09:58.849 --> 10:00.351
And Gabey makes three.

10:01.018 --> 10:03.938
Robert, thank you. Thank you for
this, thank you for all this.

10:04.021 --> 10:05.147
This night's been magical.

10:05.273 --> 10:06.399
Jim, come see
this next room.

10:06.482 --> 10:08.317
I think you
especially would like it.

10:08.693 --> 10:10.236
Really? Why?
I don't know.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.196
Maybe not. Just come.

10:20.579 --> 10:22.206
Do you regret
attacking me now, hick?

10:22.415 --> 10:25.793
Huh? Dwight. Stop it. I
was flirting with you.

10:25.876 --> 10:28.004
I was trying to use
you to make Andy jealous.

10:28.379 --> 10:29.505
I'm not going to help you.

10:29.588 --> 10:31.299
Why would you choose me?
Because I'm mighty?

10:31.382 --> 10:34.260
Because I'm the manliest man
in the office? I'll do it!

10:40.308 --> 10:41.851
Stop.
You stop.

10:41.934 --> 10:43.769
No, you stop.
No, you stop.

10:44.687 --> 10:47.356
Is he looking? You can stop.

10:47.481 --> 10:48.983
Okay, you can stop.
No,no,no, he's not looking.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.151
You can actually stop.

10:50.443 --> 10:51.694
Whoa, you guys,

10:51.777 --> 10:54.697
I just found this
insane engagement ring.

10:54.822 --> 10:55.865
Is anyone missing this?

10:55.990 --> 10:57.074
The main stone's missing.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.368
I don't know.
It looks pretty great to me.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.914
I pictured myself
here every night,

11:04.081 --> 11:06.375
eating a leg of
mutton, the juices

11:06.459 --> 11:09.920
dripping down my bare chest,
wiping my fingers on the walls.

11:11.005 --> 11:12.256
Then I met the vegan.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.009
Good night.
To the kitchen.

11:15.092 --> 11:16.886
To the kitchen.
To the kitchen.

11:18.554 --> 11:19.680
To the kitchen.

11:21.974 --> 11:23.267
- Onward.
- Toby,

11:23.392 --> 11:26.187
what's compelling about this
is the note of persimmon.

11:26.479 --> 11:27.938
Right?
Note?

11:28.105 --> 11:29.857
It's a symphony-
Okay.

11:30.274 --> 11:31.901
You have to join my
wine tasting club.

11:31.984 --> 11:33.152
I would love that.

11:34.236 --> 11:37.448
Toby, you are
playing a dangerous game.

11:38.616 --> 11:41.786
I guess I'm through
the gateway now though, right?

11:45.790 --> 11:46.957
You know,

11:47.291 --> 11:50.628
I don't think I've ever been
in this exact angle before.

11:50.878 --> 11:53.089
I'm scared of firsts,
but I like it.

11:53.672 --> 11:55.132
You guys got to
try this pool.

11:55.758 --> 11:59.136
No top scum, no Band-Aids,
this thing is choice.

11:59.637 --> 12:00.638
You in?

12:01.305 --> 12:03.307
Yeah. Sure, sure,
I'll be right in.

12:03.557 --> 12:04.558
I've been working out,

12:05.059 --> 12:08.813
but the problem is, I've been
building muscle underneath

12:09.230 --> 12:13.150
and that top layer
hasn't burned off yet.

12:13.984 --> 12:15.152
Awkward stage.

12:16.404 --> 12:17.405
Mmm.

12:17.655 --> 12:21.242
So good. Now take a chip,
and crush it into my face

12:21.325 --> 12:24.495
and rub the grease around.
Do it. Yeah, rub it in.

12:24.620 --> 12:26.330
Yeah.
That's so good.

12:26.997 --> 12:28.582
Andy's not even looking.

12:28.666 --> 12:31.335
I think sexy eating is a dead end.
Damn it.

12:32.211 --> 12:35.381
What is the most
romantic possible thing?

12:37.341 --> 12:39.260
We can get some chicken fights
going in the pool.

12:39.385 --> 12:42.513
Dwight, that's just...
That's really perfect.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.723
Thank you. Yes.
Yes!

12:47.852 --> 12:49.520
You're in my lane!

12:50.813 --> 12:51.814
Andy,

12:52.148 --> 12:54.150
Dwight and I challenge you
and Jess to a chicken fight.

12:54.233 --> 12:55.234
Winner take all.

12:55.317 --> 12:56.360
Chicken fight!

12:56.444 --> 12:57.862
No,thanks.
Dang it!

12:57.987 --> 12:59.113
What the heck already!

12:59.196 --> 13:01.198
Cathy, chicken fight!

13:01.282 --> 13:04.368
Okay, yeah, who's going to be my partner?
Where's Jim?

13:04.618 --> 13:06.370
I'm right here.

13:12.877 --> 13:14.211
Come on, Cath.

13:15.963 --> 13:16.964
Yes!

13:17.047 --> 13:18.048
Whoo!

13:18.716 --> 13:21.844
Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking.
We work so well together.

13:21.927 --> 13:24.346
I know. I could just
bang you right now.

13:26.891 --> 13:28.601
He's not looking. Hey!

13:29.393 --> 13:32.855
I had two bears sewn together
to make this king size.

13:33.564 --> 13:35.399
Total waste of two bears.

13:37.568 --> 13:38.611
To both these bears.

13:38.694 --> 13:41.197
- To both these bears.
- Bears.

13:41.614 --> 13:43.407
To both these bears.

13:45.242 --> 13:48.621
When I put in the screening
room, I bought three movies.

13:48.704 --> 13:53.375
Caligula, Last Tango in
Paris and Emmanuelle 2.

13:54.043 --> 13:55.044
Mwa!

13:56.420 --> 13:59.673
The last two movies I
actually watched in here were

14:00.549 --> 14:03.594
Marley & Me and
On Golden  Pond.

14:04.053 --> 14:06.597
I mean, it's clearly meant
for watching erotic cinema.

14:06.764 --> 14:08.766
Yeah. We could watch some
right now, if you want.

14:09.975 --> 14:12.436
I've got a Korean
film on my iPod.

14:12.978 --> 14:15.272
If you want to just...
If you have the cables.

14:17.066 --> 14:18.817
Kelly, that's
a crazy ring you found.

14:19.276 --> 14:21.153
Yeah. Thanks, I'm
really glad that I found it.

14:21.403 --> 14:22.780
I can't believe
you're wearing it.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.240
Are you not
superstitious at all?

14:24.323 --> 14:26.951
Of course I'm superstitious,
what are you talking about?

14:27.201 --> 14:30.996
Ring of a failed marriage might
have some sinister energy, right?

14:31.288 --> 14:32.248
Am I just being silly?

14:32.331 --> 14:33.958
I don't think
you're being silly.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.042
Oh, God.

14:35.125 --> 14:36.293
You know what?
I can just sell it

14:36.460 --> 14:37.670
and put the money
in the party fund.

14:38.379 --> 14:39.380
Oh...

14:39.588 --> 14:41.257
Then another woman will get
it, we can't allow that.

14:41.340 --> 14:42.800
We have to destroy it.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.635
Come on. Let's
chicken fight those two.

14:50.432 --> 14:52.351
How was that?
Okay, watch my toes.

14:54.562 --> 14:56.939
Hey, Val, want a beer?

14:57.231 --> 14:59.358
It might taste better than that
pool water you've been drinking.

14:59.441 --> 15:00.818
No, I'm good. Thank you.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.403
Cool.
Cool.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.198
Does Darryl not swim?

15:06.615 --> 15:09.076
That's racist. I don't know,

15:09.243 --> 15:13.330
but I would say by looking at
him, no, Darryl does not swim.

15:14.790 --> 15:17.543
That's all right! That's all right!
We got this!

15:17.793 --> 15:19.169
Yeah!
Yeah!

15:21.005 --> 15:24.341
Maybe we should take a little break.
Dwight, we've got this.

15:24.425 --> 15:27.177
I promise. I will not leave
your shoulders no matter what.

15:27.845 --> 15:28.846
Okay.

15:29.263 --> 15:30.973
- One more?
- Yeah. Great.

15:35.144 --> 15:36.729
Mush! Mush! Mush!

15:38.105 --> 15:39.690
Come on!
Go!

15:42.526 --> 15:44.194
Here we go.

15:45.195 --> 15:46.196
Yay!

15:46.864 --> 15:48.198
Whoa!
Wow.

15:48.657 --> 15:51.118
I cannot believe you're still on.
I can't believe it either.

15:51.201 --> 15:53.162
I've got this!

16:08.886 --> 16:11.889
Erin, did we win?

16:12.973 --> 16:14.683
Sure. Sure, we did.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.394
You're lying.
We didn't win.

16:17.478 --> 16:20.356
Hey, hey, hey, Dwight! It's okay!
Just rest. Just rest.

16:20.481 --> 16:22.733
You've broken up your last
couple, you evil ring.

16:23.567 --> 16:24.568
Do it.

16:26.236 --> 16:29.239
We're in the pool.
Shove it, Angela.

16:30.074 --> 16:33.243
Same old party,
same old people, am I right?

16:33.994 --> 16:35.287
Reminds me of
Phyllis' birthday.

16:35.412 --> 16:38.290
Ooh. Do not remind me of
Phyllis' birthday. I know.

16:38.957 --> 16:42.419
But boy, that Erin, she sure is
a ripe little tiger, isn't she?

16:42.836 --> 16:44.380
Meow!

16:45.005 --> 16:47.591
And to think I always thought
of her as a second Meredith.

16:49.802 --> 16:51.637
Respectfully, I don't
want us walking into

16:51.762 --> 16:54.264
a similar Angela kind of situation.
Mmm.

16:54.348 --> 16:56.684
So I just want to make sure
that you are completely

16:56.767 --> 16:59.436
100% done with Erin.

17:00.521 --> 17:05.859
Last I checked, I'm with Jessica
and I like to get my monog on.

17:07.277 --> 17:08.946
It's monogamy
for my hog and me.

17:09.029 --> 17:10.406
Not what I asked.
We're done.

17:10.489 --> 17:12.116
Erin and I are over.
Okay.

17:12.199 --> 17:16.537
So then you won't mind if
tonight I just go crazy on her?

17:16.620 --> 17:18.872
Just go nuts...

17:19.540 --> 17:20.958
With sex.

17:21.750 --> 17:22.751
Have at it.

17:22.835 --> 17:25.963
Or take it slow,
whatever you guys work out.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.093
You're an idiot.

17:45.190 --> 17:46.942
Cannonball!

17:52.322 --> 17:53.574
Let's do this.

18:00.122 --> 18:01.123
Oh...

18:01.540 --> 18:04.334
So I kind of stepped on this.
I think it's yours.

18:04.835 --> 18:05.836
Yeah.

18:06.378 --> 18:07.463
Oh. Wow.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.631
How did you know
it was mine?

18:10.132 --> 18:12.092
The Bernard family seal, duh.

18:13.886 --> 18:14.887
Duh.

18:18.182 --> 18:20.309
Sorry if your
special night was ruined.

18:21.059 --> 18:25.189
Oh, whoa, whoa, no,
it's not a special night.

18:26.648 --> 18:27.941
Oh, you weren't
going to do it?

18:29.193 --> 18:31.904
Honestly, Erin,
I don't know what I'm doing.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.366
I just...

18:37.159 --> 18:38.285
I don't know.

18:40.746 --> 18:41.747
Thank you.

18:46.293 --> 18:47.961
Andy's confused.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.506
That's not what I was hoping for.
But it's not so bad either.

18:50.589 --> 18:53.300
I can live with confused.
I get confused.

18:53.383 --> 18:55.302
I totally get confused.

18:56.220 --> 18:57.721
And, of course,
the pool.

19:00.057 --> 19:04.102
Ultimate lubricant
for any wild evening.

19:04.937 --> 19:10.234
It was here that my parties would
have crescendoed into true madness.

19:11.652 --> 19:12.653
To madness.

19:12.736 --> 19:14.655
Madness.
To madness.

19:14.738 --> 19:16.073
To madness!

19:19.284 --> 19:21.620
Hey, I think you
parked my car in.

19:21.703 --> 19:22.955
Is there any way
you can move your van?

19:23.038 --> 19:25.666
Hey, I'm sorry. When I got
here, I put my keys in a bowl.

19:25.749 --> 19:26.792
Are you serious?

19:26.875 --> 19:29.753
Robert, I want you to know, I'm here
to rock with you as late as you want.

19:30.504 --> 19:32.214
And that goes
double for me.

19:32.297 --> 19:34.091
I'll stay even
later than you'd like.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.646
Toby, I am Bacchus,
god of wine.

19:47.771 --> 19:49.356
And I am Bacchus' friend!

19:54.653 --> 19:57.364
Gentlemen, bear witness,
while I've been

19:57.447 --> 19:59.283
mourning the nights
that never were,

19:59.366 --> 20:02.035
one of them has been
unfolding here before me.

20:08.792 --> 20:10.127
This is no get-together.

20:11.795 --> 20:12.796
This is a party.

20:26.059 --> 20:27.060
Yes!

20:34.109 --> 20:35.986
And there's
my talking point.

20:59.343 --> 21:01.261
Yes, that's it.
Push yourselves, boys.

21:02.095 --> 21:05.015
It's not a party if you don't
do something that scares you.

21:07.935 --> 21:09.186
I need a breather.

21:14.483 --> 21:15.859
You two keep going.

21:17.027 --> 21:19.279
Hey, he's asleep.
We can just leave.

21:20.030 --> 21:21.198
So leave.
