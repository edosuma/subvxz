offered me the job

00:09.052 --> 00:11.054
my P.I. business,
I jumped at it.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.186
Meet my best friends.

00:12.229 --> 00:13.709
We make a hell of a team.

00:13.752 --> 00:16.016
That's Rick. If you want
something on the island,

00:16.059 --> 00:17.147
Rick is the man to see.

00:17.191 --> 00:19.367
Hey, what about me? That's TC.

00:19.410 --> 00:22.283
He runs the best helicopter
tour business in Hawaii.

00:22.326 --> 00:23.980
That's Sebastian Nuzo.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.026
The four of us spent
some time in a POW camp

00:26.069 --> 00:27.201
in Afghanistan.

00:27.244 --> 00:29.029
Nuzo saved my life.

00:32.075 --> 00:33.990
I couldn't save his.

This is Juliet Higgins.

Easy, lads.

00:41.693 --> 00:43.956
Friends like those come around
once in a lifetime.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.307

Rick's at work.

TC has clients.

01:09.939 --> 01:11.593
Find some more friends.

Or, you know, get yourself
an Uber account.

01:13.638 --> 01:15.901
Because Mr. Masters
is not paying me

01:15.945 --> 01:16.989
to be your chauffeur.

01:17.033 --> 01:18.556
Noted.

01:18.600 --> 01:19.905
So you won't be
calling on me again?

01:19.949 --> 01:22.038
I won't have to.
Ferrari's ready tomorrow.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.518
And how do you intend

01:23.561 --> 01:24.910
to pay for the

01:24.954 --> 01:27.913
Don't worry. I got it covered.

Stop right here.

01:50.501 --> 01:52.677
Why am I pulling over?

01:52.721 --> 01:55.811
I just got to see a friend.
It'll take two minutes.

01:55.854 --> 01:58.814
At two minutes and one second,
I won't be here.

01:58.857 --> 02:00.120
Oh, and one more thing.

02:01.730 --> 02:03.688
Yes?

02:11.218 --> 02:12.958
Oh, well, it's only fair
I should get 50%.

Because it seems
that someone

You said on the phone you,
uh, you're a friend of Nuzo's.

06:30.912 --> 06:32.435
Yeah, yeah. Couple years back,

06:32.479 --> 06:34.437
my trawler broke down
off Waimanalo.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.439
I'm a commercial fisherman.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.659
Uh, anyway, I was dead
in the water.

06:38.702 --> 06:42.271
Thanks.
And, uh, Nuzo was close by,

06:42.314 --> 06:43.620
and he gave me a tow.

06:43.664 --> 06:46.101
We kept in touch.

06:46.144 --> 06:49.278
Really, he's a good guy.
I miss him already.

06:49.321 --> 06:52.063

So, um, how can I help you,
Mr. Sawyer?

06:58.113 --> 07:01.943
Well, every other Friday,
I sell my best catch to Lina's,

07:01.986 --> 07:04.685
upscale joint off Ala Moana.

07:04.728 --> 07:06.687
They like to bypass
the fish auction

07:06.730 --> 07:10.038
and secure fresh, high-quality
tuna for the weekend, you know?

07:10.081 --> 07:11.648
Well,

07:11.692 --> 07:13.302
this morning...

07:13.345 --> 07:14.999
[chuckles]
I hauled this in.

07:15.043 --> 07:16.392
[chuckling]: Wow.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.437
That is a big fish.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.569
Almost 300 pounds.

07:19.613 --> 07:21.571
Anyway, this morning,

07:21.615 --> 07:24.269
I go by Lina's to drop it off,
same as always.

07:24.313 --> 07:26.837
I go inside to find
someone to take delivery.

07:26.881 --> 07:28.448
When I return to my van,

07:28.491 --> 07:30.450
the back door's open,
the fish is gone.

07:32.626 --> 07:35.846
So you want me
to track down a... a fish?

07:38.196 --> 07:41.373
A bluefin that size
is worth 350 thou,

07:41.417 --> 07:43.724
based on this
morning's prices.

07:43.767 --> 07:47.336
Besides, I...
I need the money, bad.

07:47.379 --> 07:48.380
Why is that?

07:48.424 --> 07:51.471
I've had a rough season.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.211
[sighs]

07:53.255 --> 07:55.387
Competition from
imports is up,

07:55.431 --> 07:57.433
fuel prices are up,
labor costs are up.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.175
We have a saying:
fishing's like the ocean.

08:00.218 --> 08:01.393
There are waves.

08:01.437 --> 08:03.091
And this has been
a really bad one.

08:03.134 --> 08:04.962
I mean, worst ever.

08:05.006 --> 08:07.530
And it's put me in a deep hole.

08:07.574 --> 08:09.532
I've had to lay off
half my crew.

08:09.576 --> 08:12.492
That fish was going to
get me back on my feet.

08:12.535 --> 08:15.103
And if I don't get it back
and get paid,

08:15.146 --> 08:16.713
I'm gonna lose my boat.

08:16.757 --> 08:18.541
And she's all I got.

08:18.585 --> 08:21.718
Did you contact HPD about this?

08:21.762 --> 08:24.025
I'm coming to you
because I can't wait around

08:24.068 --> 08:25.940
for them to investigate.

08:25.983 --> 08:29.726
That tuna's gonna go bad
if I don't get it back soon.

08:29.770 --> 08:33.425
Now, I can't afford to pay you.

08:33.469 --> 08:36.341
But-but if you
find that fish,

08:36.385 --> 08:37.952
I can give you
a cut of the sale.

08:37.995 --> 08:40.737
Mr. Magnum, when I
came back from 'Nam,

08:40.781 --> 08:45.002
I didn't ask for nothing
from nobody.

08:45.046 --> 08:49.311
But now I need some help.

08:49.354 --> 08:51.226
And I got no one else
to turn to.

08:51.269 --> 08:54.229
MAGNUM:
"No one else to turn to."

08:54.272 --> 08:55.970
You hear that a lot
in this job,

08:56.013 --> 08:58.538
especially from the clients
who can't afford you.

08:58.581 --> 09:03.151
And here's the annoying thing:
it works every time.

09:12.073 --> 09:14.815
MAGNUM: My meeting with Dan
had me thinking about Nuzo,

09:14.858 --> 09:16.817
and how if he were still alive,

09:16.860 --> 09:20.037
he'd be the first one
to step up and help this guy.

09:20.081 --> 09:21.473
That's just who Nuzo was.

09:21.517 --> 09:22.997
He looked out for his friends.

09:44.627 --> 09:46.063
Nah.

What's that?

10:03.603 --> 10:04.691
Everybody's waiting.

10:04.734 --> 10:07.476
Yeah. Just...

10:07.519 --> 10:09.086
I'll get dressed.

10:14.091 --> 10:15.658
You okay?

10:15.702 --> 10:18.182
Yeah. I'm good.

10:24.145 --> 10:26.451
Do we really
gotta do this, man?

Hey. One of
the public affairs guys

10:36.157 --> 10:38.507

is gonna fly

10:38.550 --> 10:42.163

after the press conference.

10:42.206 --> 10:43.599

First class, huh?

10:46.689 --> 10:48.778
All right, come on. What is it?

10:49.823 --> 10:51.651
I don't know.

10:55.089 --> 10:57.657
You know,
it's gonna sound weird.

10:59.746 --> 11:03.619
I don't think
I'm ready to go home.

11:06.056 --> 11:07.841
Actually, it's not weird at all.

11:10.887 --> 11:13.716
To tell you the truth,

11:13.760 --> 11:17.024
I got no burning desire
to go back to Brooklyn.

11:23.639 --> 11:25.641
You know what?

11:27.687 --> 11:30.037
What if we didn't go back home?

11:36.391 --> 11:39.133

a tuna bounty hunter now?

but instead of scumbags,
you go after seafood.

11:42.745 --> 11:45.356
You joke now, but this case
could actually turn out

11:45.400 --> 11:46.749
to be a pretty good payday.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.620
If I find that fish,
I get a recovery fee.

11:48.664 --> 11:50.579
Five percent of the sale.

11:50.622 --> 11:52.755
What's that, a buck 50? Kammy!

11:52.799 --> 11:53.887
What's up, big man?

11:53.930 --> 11:55.236
Casablanca, my brother.

11:55.279 --> 11:56.585
Come here, open your mouth.Ah...

11:56.628 --> 11:57.804
Open your mouth.All right, all right.

11:57.847 --> 11:59.588
What do you got?
Come on, what do you got?

11:59.631 --> 12:01.764
Oh, my God.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.070
Oh, my God, that's some

12:03.113 --> 12:04.767
damn fine gravy,
my friend.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.116
Mm!That's what I like to hear.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.727
This the private eye
you was telling me about?

12:07.770 --> 12:10.991
Thomas Magnum, and I prefer
"private investigator."

12:11.034 --> 12:14.037
Whatever, Rockford.
Here, try this.

12:16.039 --> 12:18.433
That's not bad.

12:18.476 --> 12:22.176
And by "not bad,"
that is some amazing sauce.

12:22.219 --> 12:23.786
I like this guy.

12:23.830 --> 12:26.615
So what you guys think
about my new venture?

12:26.658 --> 12:28.269
This place has got charm, huh?

12:28.312 --> 12:29.879
RICK: Yeah, except I'm a little
confused at you opening

12:29.923 --> 12:31.794
a brick and mortar.
I thought you said

12:31.838 --> 12:33.796
when it comes to grinds,
you got to go mobile?

12:33.840 --> 12:35.624
Yeah, well,
these two amateurs got in

12:35.667 --> 12:37.060
over their heads
with this joint.

12:37.104 --> 12:39.715
They're 'ohana,
so I had to bail them out.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.283
So Casablanca over here said
you looking for a stolen tunie.

12:42.326 --> 12:43.719
Yeah, and I'm thinking

12:43.763 --> 12:45.503
whoever has it's
gonna try to unload it fast.

12:45.547 --> 12:46.809
I was hoping you might
have some idea

12:46.853 --> 12:48.028
of how they're gonna move it.

12:48.071 --> 12:50.334
Rick said you're the
man that would know.

12:50.378 --> 12:53.076
They could chop it up
like a stolen rock,

12:53.120 --> 12:54.686
sell it on the black market.

12:54.730 --> 12:57.733
But like all fish,
fresh tuna got a shelf life.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.301
One that big, you risk
a good chunk of it going bad

13:00.344 --> 13:01.911
before you get
a chance to move it.

13:01.955 --> 13:03.826
So you'd want to sell it whole.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.175
Yeah, but
who's buying?

13:05.219 --> 13:07.177
Some all-you-can-eat sushi shack

13:07.221 --> 13:09.658
doesn't have the bankroll
for a big-ticket tuna like that.

13:09.701 --> 13:12.704
Yeah, and I'm guessing high-end
joints like Maile's or Nobu

13:12.748 --> 13:14.750
aren't sourcing their fish
on the black market.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.578
As a general rule, no.

13:16.621 --> 13:18.493
But there's exceptions.

13:18.536 --> 13:21.278
MAGNUM: After I agreed
to have at least one meal

13:21.322 --> 13:23.411
at his shrimp truck every week
for the next month,

13:23.454 --> 13:25.805
Rick's friend gave me a list
of places to look into.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.676
It only took me two hours
and eight lunches

13:27.719 --> 13:28.764
to get the information
I needed.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.506
Like I said, can't help you.

13:36.163 --> 13:39.470
You know, I-I got a buddy
who runs a club. Okay?

13:39.514 --> 13:41.864
So I know a little something
about the food service business.

13:41.908 --> 13:43.431
I know how sketchy it can get.

13:43.474 --> 13:45.650
Okay? I-I know how,
from time to time,

13:45.694 --> 13:47.739
something may arise where
knowing someone like me

13:47.783 --> 13:49.132
could be very helpful.

13:49.176 --> 13:52.440
You help me out,
and I will owe you a favor.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.878
Okay.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.314
Someone called me
this morning.

13:57.358 --> 13:58.925
He said he had
some primo bluefin.

13:58.968 --> 14:00.448
But he never showed.

14:00.491 --> 14:02.058
How come?Don't know.

14:02.102 --> 14:03.494
Maybe he got a better offer.

14:03.538 --> 14:05.888
Okay, I'm gonna need a name.

14:32.088 --> 14:34.047
MAGNUM:
Okay, there's only one reason

14:34.090 --> 14:37.746
someone would let frozen food
go to waste like that.

14:37.789 --> 14:39.356
'Cause they need
the freezer space.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.465
This is what we in the business call the payoff.

15:01.509 --> 15:04.164
It's where we wrap up the case
and high-five ourselves.

15:04.207 --> 15:07.994
The only thing left now is to bring the client back his fish.

15:08.037 --> 15:09.430
[gun clicks]

15:09.473 --> 15:12.172
Turn around, slowly.

15:12.215 --> 15:14.174
The water meter's
outside.

15:14.217 --> 15:15.740
But you know that, don't you?

15:15.784 --> 15:18.134
Easy. Okay?
Private investigator.

15:18.178 --> 15:19.570
The man who caught this fish

15:19.614 --> 15:21.833
hired me to find it.You mean Dan?

15:23.009 --> 15:25.315
Yeah. I'm guessing you guys
know each other.

15:25.359 --> 15:27.709
I worked for him.

15:27.752 --> 15:29.450
But he had to let me go
last month.

15:29.493 --> 15:32.322
I just needed that fish
so I wouldn't lose my house.

15:32.366 --> 15:34.759
Hey, look, it looks like you got
a wife and a daughter.

15:34.803 --> 15:36.413
Don't do anything
stupid, okay?

15:36.457 --> 15:39.112
Just let me walk out of here
with my client's fish.

15:39.155 --> 15:40.678
I won't even tell him
who stole it.

15:40.722 --> 15:42.550
I-I can't let you do that.

15:42.593 --> 15:44.291
Why not?

15:44.334 --> 15:47.729
Because someone took my family,

15:47.772 --> 15:49.861
and that's the only thing
that can save them.

15:57.304 --> 15:59.262
Tua was on his way
to sell the fish when he got

15:59.306 --> 16:00.655
the call on his cell.
We're not sure how,

16:00.698 --> 16:02.396
but the voice on the other end
knew Tua had it.

16:02.439 --> 16:04.398
Said he had his family
and would trade them for it.

16:04.441 --> 16:06.095
That's the craziest ransom
I ever heard of.

16:06.139 --> 16:07.270
It's a fish.

16:07.314 --> 16:11.622
Yeah, it's also worth 350,000.

16:11.666 --> 16:13.189
After Tua
got the call,

16:13.233 --> 16:14.756
he came back here to wait
for instructions.

16:14.799 --> 16:17.715
Same guy just called back
a few minutes ago with details

16:17.759 --> 16:19.674
on the ransom drop.I-I don't get it.
I don't get it.

16:19.717 --> 16:21.676
Why grab the family?
Why not just come straight here?

16:21.719 --> 16:23.504
Because this is a rental.

16:23.547 --> 16:25.723
My wife and I are
living apart right now.

16:25.767 --> 16:28.726
Things haven't been so
good since I lost my job.

16:30.859 --> 16:31.773
Hey, Tua.

16:31.816 --> 16:33.557
Let me talk
to TC and Rick.

16:33.601 --> 16:34.994
Give us a minute.

16:35.037 --> 16:37.648
Okay.Thanks.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.783
And let me guess, you want to
be the hero and make the drop.

16:41.826 --> 16:43.350
Tua can't handle it.
He's too emotional.

16:43.393 --> 16:44.742
The drop could go sideways.

16:44.786 --> 16:46.657
What about HPD?They said they'd
kill Tua's family

16:46.701 --> 16:47.832
if he called Five-O.

16:47.876 --> 16:49.138
That's why we need
to handle the trade.

16:49.182 --> 16:51.662
And once we get Tua's family
back home safe,

16:51.706 --> 16:53.099
then we'll call Tanaka.

16:53.142 --> 16:56.798
Sounds good, but who's
this "we" you're talking about?

16:56.841 --> 16:58.060
You, me and Rick.

16:58.104 --> 16:59.975
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no...

17:00.019 --> 17:02.717
Whoa. I came here because you
said you had to move something.

17:02.760 --> 17:05.024
You didn't say nothing
about no hostages.

17:05.067 --> 17:06.503
Don't worry. I got a plan.

17:06.547 --> 17:08.679
Do you care to share that plan,
just for the halibut?

17:08.723 --> 17:10.551
Uh, not if you're gonna be
dropping bad puns, no.

17:10.594 --> 17:14.207
Well, Thomas, no offense,
but if there's gonna be trouble,

17:14.250 --> 17:15.730
I'd like to know the plan, too.

17:15.773 --> 17:17.688
I'll tell you on the way.

17:18.733 --> 17:20.474
This was supposed to be easy.

17:20.517 --> 17:22.345
Find a hot fish,
help out a fellow vet.

17:22.389 --> 17:26.697
I think it's fair to say it's
gotten a bit more complicated.

17:26.741 --> 17:29.700
Hey. Go inside, don't call
anyone, don't talk to anyone.

17:29.744 --> 17:32.225
Okay.

17:32.268 --> 17:34.357
Hey, I'm gonna get 'em back.

17:37.404 --> 17:38.666
You have my word.

Relax, okay?

18:02.559 --> 18:03.865
I got what you want.

18:03.908 --> 18:05.693
What I want
is for you to shut up.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.740
Put it down.

18:09.784 --> 18:11.829
As long as you're holding
that gun, I'm holding this.

18:11.873 --> 18:13.788
Should I be scared?Very.

but I'm-a keep coming

that gun.

22:54.938 --> 22:57.463
Some years back,
a Chinese spy was using

22:57.506 --> 23:00.291
sides of beef to smuggle
microfiche out of his country.

23:00.335 --> 23:03.469
It's possible that this fish
was being used

23:03.512 --> 23:05.949
to smuggle intel,
most likely on flash drive.

23:05.993 --> 23:07.473
If that is the case here,

23:07.516 --> 23:10.127
the restaurant your client
delivers fish to regularly,

23:10.171 --> 23:11.781
that could be the dead drop.

23:11.825 --> 23:14.044
It sounds complicated.TC: And messy.

23:14.088 --> 23:16.003
I mean, why not just
pass the flash drive off

23:16.046 --> 23:17.265
in a movie theater?

23:17.308 --> 23:19.441
Because spies don't usually
meet in person.

23:19.485 --> 23:21.704
The less you know,
the longer you live.

23:21.748 --> 23:23.184
And the dead drop
guarantees anonymity.

23:23.227 --> 23:26.100
RICK: You know,
now that the whole

23:26.143 --> 23:28.189
"Higgins was a spy" thing
is out of the bag,

23:28.232 --> 23:29.669
I've been dying to
ask one question.

23:29.712 --> 23:31.061
Is there some nerdy guy

23:31.105 --> 23:33.890
in a basement lab somewhere
making you gadgets?

23:33.934 --> 23:36.371
Like, is that necklace
really a spy camera?

23:36.415 --> 23:38.373
Touch it, I break your fingers.

23:38.417 --> 23:42.290
Go ahead, man, try it.
I dare you.

23:42.333 --> 23:44.684
[laughs][phone chimes]

23:47.513 --> 23:48.818
Dan's here.

23:50.385 --> 23:53.040
You gotta believe me, if there
was contraband in my fish,

23:53.083 --> 23:54.084
I know nothing about it.

23:54.128 --> 23:56.739
What can you tell me
about your crew?

23:56.783 --> 23:58.132
The guys that weren't laid off.

23:58.175 --> 24:01.222
I can tell you one of them's
gone AWOL: Victor Garza.

24:01.265 --> 24:02.484
He worked as a deckhand.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.094
I tried reaching out
to him earlier.

24:04.138 --> 24:06.314
Wasn't answering his calls,
so I got concerned.

24:06.357 --> 24:08.490
I went by his apartment,
except when I got there,

24:08.534 --> 24:10.797
the door was open,
and he was gone.

24:10.840 --> 24:11.841
Got me wondering.

24:11.885 --> 24:13.495
Maybe it was him
who stole my fish.

24:13.539 --> 24:16.150
It wasn't him,
but if he's gone missing,

24:16.193 --> 24:17.586
whatever was in that fish,

24:17.630 --> 24:19.806
Victor's probably the one
who put it there.

24:19.849 --> 24:21.547
Right.

24:21.590 --> 24:24.288
Mahalo.

24:29.293 --> 24:30.686
You tell him about Tua?

24:30.730 --> 24:32.122
Nah, I left that part out.

24:32.166 --> 24:33.602
But I did make him promise

24:33.646 --> 24:35.430
to sell to a different
restaurant, no questions asked.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.127
Great. Case closed.
Let's go to the beach.

24:37.171 --> 24:38.520
Not exactly.

24:38.564 --> 24:39.826
If Higgins is right,

24:39.869 --> 24:41.218
and that place really is
a dead drop,

24:41.262 --> 24:42.785
I'm gonna need to check it out.

24:42.829 --> 24:44.047
Hold up a sec.

24:44.091 --> 24:45.875
Your boy Dan got
his fish back.

24:45.919 --> 24:47.181
It's HPD's turn.

24:47.224 --> 24:48.791
The guys who stole the fish
are gonna be looking

24:48.835 --> 24:51.098
to tie up some loose ends,
so that means Tua, his family,

24:51.141 --> 24:52.926
Dan, the three of us...

24:52.969 --> 24:55.537
Until those guys are caught,
we're all in danger.

24:55.581 --> 24:57.974
And I'm not waiting
for the cops to play catch-up.

24:58.018 --> 24:59.323
TC: Okay.

24:59.367 --> 25:01.717
Do what you got to do.

25:01.761 --> 25:03.632
Rick and I will
babysit Dan and Tua.

25:03.676 --> 25:05.373
Whoa, hang on. Thanks for
volunteering me, pal,

25:05.416 --> 25:07.897
but I got plans.TC: You heard Magnum.

25:07.941 --> 25:08.985
Tua's got a family.

25:09.029 --> 25:10.987
All we gotta do is
keep 'em alive

25:11.031 --> 25:13.120
until our boy figures out
what this is about.

25:13.163 --> 25:14.469
Yeah, but who's gonna
keep us alive?

25:14.513 --> 25:15.557
TC: Aw.

25:15.601 --> 25:17.646
I'll protect you, Orville.

25:17.690 --> 25:20.257
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

25:20.301 --> 25:21.520
But, Thomas, these guys
are serious players,

25:21.563 --> 25:23.086
and there are likely
to be more of them.

25:23.130 --> 25:24.697
You sure you want
to do this alone?

25:24.740 --> 25:26.916
Oh, I don't plan
on doing this alone.

25:31.399 --> 25:32.835
Higgins.

25:32.879 --> 25:34.054
[growling]

25:34.097 --> 25:36.839
I need a favor.

25:36.883 --> 25:39.276
Didn't you ask me
for a favor last week?

25:39.320 --> 25:40.626
I didn't know
you only grant one a lifetime.

25:40.669 --> 25:42.628
Do I look like a genie, Magnum?

25:42.671 --> 25:45.108
At your disposal,
every time you fancy a wish?

25:45.152 --> 25:47.371
Forget I asked.

25:47.415 --> 25:49.460
Already done.

25:49.504 --> 25:50.461
Although,

25:50.505 --> 25:52.333
now I am curious

25:52.376 --> 25:54.770
as to the nature of the favor
you were gonna ask for.

25:55.945 --> 25:58.208
I was hoping you'd go
to dinner with me.

25:59.645 --> 26:02.386
Magnum, are you asking me out
on a date?

26:02.430 --> 26:05.346
No. Not a date. A favor.

26:05.389 --> 26:07.217
Okay, I want to go check
out that restaurant

26:07.261 --> 26:09.611
tonight, and I need somebody
who's good with computers.

26:09.655 --> 26:11.439
You mean someone
who's good at hacking?

26:11.482 --> 26:13.615
Yeah.What's in it for me,

26:13.659 --> 26:15.748
besides sustenance?

26:15.791 --> 26:18.272
Aren't you just a little curious

26:18.315 --> 26:20.622
what was being smuggled
inside that fish?

26:20.666 --> 26:22.276
Magnum, I'm no longer MI6.

26:22.319 --> 26:24.104
I left that world behind
in London.

26:24.147 --> 26:26.236
What's it gonna take?

26:27.455 --> 26:29.370
Hmm. I don't know.

26:29.413 --> 26:31.241
What do you have to offer?

26:31.285 --> 26:35.419
I will stay out of
the wine cellar for a month.

26:35.463 --> 26:38.248
Magnum, you're not even supposed
to be in the wine cellar,

26:38.292 --> 26:40.642
so that's hardly a mutually
beneficial transaction.

26:40.686 --> 26:43.253
Okay, every time
I drive the Ferrari,

26:43.297 --> 26:45.429
I will return it
with a full tank of gas.

26:45.473 --> 26:47.649
Washed?By hand.

26:47.693 --> 26:50.434
Your hands
or Mr. Masters' staff?

26:50.478 --> 26:51.914
These mitts.

26:52.959 --> 26:54.482
Tempting.

26:54.525 --> 26:57.006
But sadly, I'm going

26:57.050 --> 26:59.008
to have to, uh, refuse
your invitation.

26:59.052 --> 27:02.272
I'm sorry, Magnum, but you have
absolutely nothing to offer.

27:02.316 --> 27:04.884
Might I suggest you call
the FBI for assistance?

27:04.927 --> 27:06.407
After all, national security

27:06.450 --> 27:07.713
is their purview.

27:07.756 --> 27:09.584
Uh, look, by the time the Feds
get up to speed,

27:09.628 --> 27:11.368
the trail
could be cold.

27:11.412 --> 27:13.196
Besides, I want
to see this through.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.504
That's very adult of you.

27:16.547 --> 27:19.376
Okay, I'm done.

27:19.420 --> 27:21.117
You know, there's one thing
I don't understand.

27:22.162 --> 27:23.685
What?

27:24.730 --> 27:27.297
You practically work pro bono.

27:27.341 --> 27:30.649
I mean, you barely make any
money as a private investigator.

27:30.692 --> 27:33.173
You live off the good graces
and largesse

27:33.216 --> 27:35.654
of others, constantly having
to ask people for favors.

27:35.697 --> 27:37.307
Is there a point here?

27:38.526 --> 27:40.528
Why do you do it?

27:42.008 --> 27:43.966
I'm genuinely curious.

27:47.013 --> 27:50.407
When I was a sailor,
I didn't make much.

27:50.451 --> 27:53.280
I did it because I thought
I was helping people.

27:55.282 --> 27:58.154
I-I guess that's all I know.

28:00.374 --> 28:03.072
Magnum.

28:07.381 --> 28:08.730
I'll go.

28:08.774 --> 28:10.732
You will?

28:10.776 --> 28:12.342
Yes.

28:12.386 --> 28:13.953
I will be your date.

28:13.996 --> 28:16.303
Undercover associate.

28:16.346 --> 28:18.131
Of course, you may call it
whatever you wish.

28:18.174 --> 28:19.349
What's your plan?

28:19.393 --> 28:21.482
I don't know.

28:21.525 --> 28:24.354
Break up a spy ring,
try not to get killed.

28:24.398 --> 28:28.837
I was kind of hoping you'd be
a little more prepared.

28:38.064 --> 28:40.240
MAGNUM: You know, I was thinking, uh...

28:40.283 --> 28:41.807
That explains
the beads of sweat.

28:43.199 --> 28:44.679
Chances are,

28:44.723 --> 28:46.812
the same person went to
the restaurant each time

28:46.855 --> 28:49.902
to pick up the intel, most
likely posing as a regular

28:49.945 --> 28:51.817
to avoid arousing suspicion.

28:51.860 --> 28:53.253
In theory, all we'd have to do

28:53.296 --> 28:54.733
is access
the reservation system,

28:54.776 --> 28:56.735
cross-reference that
with anyone who ate at Lina's

28:56.778 --> 28:58.867
on the days Dan Sawyer
delivered a fish.

28:58.911 --> 29:00.347
You do realize
it's highly unlikely

29:00.390 --> 29:02.001
they used their real name?

29:02.044 --> 29:04.699
Yeah, but even knowing an alias
could still lead us somewhere.

29:07.180 --> 29:08.877
[sniffing]

29:08.921 --> 29:10.923
Magnum, what is that smell?

29:10.966 --> 29:12.751
I don't smell anything.

29:22.761 --> 29:23.892
[quietly]:
Be right back.

29:23.936 --> 29:25.894
Mm-hmm.

29:33.989 --> 29:35.774
Thanks.

29:40.430 --> 29:41.736
Enjoy your dinner.I definitely will.

29:41.780 --> 29:42.955
[chuckles]

29:44.304 --> 29:46.262
You in?

29:46.306 --> 29:48.264
I'm working on it. The system
is password-protected,

29:48.308 --> 29:50.745
so it may take a little time.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.573
I thought you were supposed
to be good at this stuff.

29:52.616 --> 29:55.184
Good evening. May I offer you
some wine or a cocktail?

29:55.228 --> 29:56.925
Actually, I think we can order.

29:56.969 --> 29:58.274
Right, honey?

30:00.102 --> 30:03.323
Yes, yes. I will have
the green papaya salad,

30:03.366 --> 30:05.281
the mahi-mahi with
lemon beurre blanc

30:05.325 --> 30:07.327
and a glass of the 2014 Aubert.

30:07.370 --> 30:09.633
Excellent choices. For you, sir?

30:09.677 --> 30:12.375
Uh, I'll do the steak,
well-done.

30:12.419 --> 30:14.856
Uh, oh, and a bottle
of your best Château Margaux.

30:14.900 --> 30:17.816
It's my birthday, and, uh,
my bae here is treating.

30:17.859 --> 30:19.687
Absolutely, sir. Happy birthday.

30:19.730 --> 30:20.819
Thank you very much.

30:20.862 --> 30:22.211
[chuckling]

30:22.255 --> 30:24.213
You do realize that
Mr. Masters' business manager

30:24.257 --> 30:25.780
will deny the expenditure.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.216
Eh, that'll take weeks.

30:27.260 --> 30:29.566
I'll have my tuna money by then.
I'll pay him back.

30:29.610 --> 30:31.003
Tuna money?Yeah.

30:31.046 --> 30:32.743
I sincerely wish I could replay
what you just said.

30:32.787 --> 30:35.790
And that is the wrong
knife, by the way.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.715
Would you like a straw?

30:47.758 --> 30:50.805
Yes, please. Oh, and, uh,
d-do you have a coloring book?

30:51.719 --> 30:52.981
He's just kidding.

30:53.939 --> 30:55.679
We're fine. Thank you.

30:55.723 --> 30:57.116
[laughs]

30:57.159 --> 31:00.467
This is a lot more fun
than I thought it would be.

31:03.949 --> 31:06.081
[quiet laughter]

31:06.125 --> 31:09.258
[indistinct chatter]

31:09.302 --> 31:10.869
[phone chimes]

31:10.912 --> 31:14.133
Okay. I've got our guy.

31:14.176 --> 31:15.699
Maurice Fahrad.

31:15.743 --> 31:18.137
He's the only punter
that consistently dines here

31:18.180 --> 31:19.790
on the days your
client sells his fish.

31:19.834 --> 31:21.444
Can you contact one
of your old MI6 buddies,

31:21.488 --> 31:22.663
run a background check?

31:22.706 --> 31:24.230
Shall I feed you, as well?

31:24.273 --> 31:26.058
[silverware clinks]

31:27.407 --> 31:28.712
I'll be right back, my love.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.244
Okay, let's get out of here.

31:38.287 --> 31:40.507
You want to leave now?Well, yeah.

31:40.550 --> 31:42.857
Are you mad?
I'm not leaving this mahi-mahi.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.380
It's simply divine.

31:44.424 --> 31:47.383
Sit your ass down
and finish your gristle.

31:47.427 --> 31:48.819
Okay.

31:51.997 --> 31:54.695
So, your client seems
like a decent chap.

31:54.738 --> 31:56.044
Served in the Vietnam War.

31:56.088 --> 31:57.959
How'd you know that?

31:58.003 --> 32:00.266
I can read, Magnum.

32:00.309 --> 32:02.572
He was wearing an appropriately
aged Da Nang cap

32:02.616 --> 32:04.705
when he engaged
your services.

32:04.748 --> 32:06.402
Your father was
in that war, too, wasn't he?

32:07.838 --> 32:10.058
Yes. Yes, he was.

32:10.102 --> 32:11.930
Now it's my turn.

32:11.973 --> 32:13.888
Why did I agree to come tonight?

32:13.932 --> 32:15.890
Yes.It's simple.

32:15.934 --> 32:19.894
Getting closure on this
seems important to you.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.984
And as a former woman
of service myself,

32:23.028 --> 32:25.639
I thought your commitment
to a fellow veteran

32:25.682 --> 32:27.206
was quite admirable.

32:28.685 --> 32:30.600
Hold that thought.

Thank you.

32:50.316 --> 32:51.752
