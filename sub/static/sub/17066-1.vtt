00:01.535 --> 00:01.935
[thunder rumbles]

00:03.837 --> 00:05.806
[TV channel-change static,
upbeat theme music]

00:05.839 --> 00:07.408
- Mike Painter is here with me.

00:07.441 --> 00:10.144
He's called
"America's child psychologist,"

00:10.178 --> 00:13.214
and his new book is
"Shaping the Past."

00:13.247 --> 00:15.249
I'm happy to have
Mike Painter back on the show.

00:15.283 --> 00:16.384
- Thank you.
Thanks for having me.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.219
- So did becoming a father

00:18.252 --> 00:21.122
change how you
look at childhood?

00:21.155 --> 00:22.390
- Yeah, I think so.

00:22.423 --> 00:23.524
You know, at the same time,

00:23.557 --> 00:26.427
adulthood is just a mask,

00:26.460 --> 00:29.430
a sophisticated mask,
for sure.

00:29.463 --> 00:32.133
But behind it, we're all
still the kids we were.

00:32.166 --> 00:35.236
- Now, in the book,
you talk about your childhood.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.638
Uh, you lost a twin brother
when you were 12?

00:41.409 --> 00:44.412
[fly buzzing]

00:46.880 --> 00:50.551
- In 1988,
in Iron Hill, Ohio,

00:50.584 --> 00:53.221
where I was born, um,

00:53.254 --> 00:54.488
five kids went missing.

00:54.522 --> 00:55.656
- The Iron Hill murders.

00:55.689 --> 00:57.591
Never solved.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.160
- Yeah.

00:59.193 --> 01:01.229
The last victim,
the one they never found

01:01.262 --> 01:02.496
was my brother, Eddie.

01:02.530 --> 01:05.266
- You were identical twins.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.301
- Losing a twin is like
having a--

01:07.335 --> 01:09.370
a phantom limb.

01:09.403 --> 01:12.873
- How does a family
deal with something like that?

01:12.906 --> 01:14.442
- My father was
out of the picture.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.377
My mother couldn't cope.

01:16.410 --> 01:19.413
Um, I was sent
to live with relatives.

01:19.447 --> 01:22.616
I've never been back
to Iron Hill.

01:22.650 --> 01:25.453
- I want to do
something unusual.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.422
[static hissing]

01:28.456 --> 01:30.324
I have someone on the phone.

01:30.358 --> 01:32.626
12 years old.

01:32.660 --> 01:36.564
His family's gone through
a tragedy as well.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.167
I'd like you to talk to him.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.735
Show us what you do.

01:41.769 --> 01:45.105
[ominous tone]

01:47.641 --> 01:48.609
- I don't know
if that's appro--

01:48.642 --> 01:49.610
- Are you there?

01:49.643 --> 01:51.345
[static hissing]

01:51.379 --> 01:53.714
- Hello?

01:53.747 --> 01:56.617
- My name's Dr. Painter.

01:56.650 --> 01:59.187
I'm a--

01:59.220 --> 02:01.189
I'm a doctor who
kids like you talk to

02:01.222 --> 02:02.456
about stuff
that's on their mind.

02:02.490 --> 02:05.493
[clears throat]

02:05.526 --> 02:08.462
Is there anything
you want to talk to me about?

02:08.496 --> 02:12.233
[static hissing]

02:12.266 --> 02:15.369
[light chuckle]

02:15.403 --> 02:16.604
Can you tell me your name?

02:16.637 --> 02:19.640
[static hissing]

02:22.310 --> 02:23.444
What is this?

02:23.477 --> 02:27.248
- [laughing]

02:27.281 --> 02:30.218
[calliope music playing
over the phone]

02:30.251 --> 02:31.419
- Is that your TV?

02:31.452 --> 02:33.621
- [laughing]

02:33.654 --> 02:34.788
- Turn it off.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.657
- [laughing]

02:36.690 --> 02:38.259
- Turn it off.

02:38.292 --> 02:41.195
[calliope music
continues playing]

02:41.229 --> 02:43.464
- Mike.

02:43.497 --> 02:46.534
Why are you scared
to come home?

02:49.270 --> 02:52.273
[ominous tone]

03:07.621 --> 03:10.624
[telephone ringing]

03:17.665 --> 03:18.766
- Mike?

03:18.799 --> 03:21.535
[telephone ringing]

03:21.569 --> 03:23.271
Why are you scared
to come home?

03:23.304 --> 03:24.638
[flames whooshing]

03:24.672 --> 03:27.608

*

05:41.742 --> 05:48.749
*

06:18.512 --> 06:21.849
- American goldfinch.

06:21.882 --> 06:25.419
Now he's just part
of the yard.

06:25.453 --> 06:26.720
- Hey.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.962
I wanted to surprise you.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.565
- You sure know how.

06:37.598 --> 06:40.033
[gentle piano music]

06:40.067 --> 06:42.703
- Miss Marla,
who is that?

06:46.073 --> 06:48.809
- Hi, I'm Mike.
What's your name?

06:48.842 --> 06:51.912
- This is Katie.

06:51.945 --> 06:54.548
- Miss Marla?

06:54.582 --> 06:56.850
- It's my son.

06:58.986 --> 07:01.889
He is a lurker, this cat.

07:03.591 --> 07:07.828
I swear,
he kills for sport.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.931
- So you're
a vegetarian, then?

07:10.964 --> 07:13.634
- Well, I-I don't
eat songbirds.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.545
What?

07:24.578 --> 07:26.079
- No pictures
of me or Eddie...

07:26.113 --> 07:27.681
or Dad.

07:27.715 --> 07:30.984
- Well, don't
take it personally.

07:32.986 --> 07:36.023
It's just a matter
of managing

07:36.056 --> 07:38.926
intrusive thoughts.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.064
- Yeah.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.675
Thanks a lot, Mom.
It really is, um--

07:54.708 --> 07:57.611
- Why have you come?
Just tell me.

08:00.047 --> 08:03.050
No, I--
I'm so happy to see you.

08:05.553 --> 08:08.488
You are welcome here.

08:12.693 --> 08:15.963
It's just...

08:15.996 --> 08:19.600
I hope you haven't come
to rip open a wound.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.740
Once every two years,
someone turns up in Iron Hill

08:26.774 --> 08:29.943
to solve those murders.

08:34.114 --> 08:37.618
I've always been
afraid that...

08:37.651 --> 08:40.888
one day it would be you.

08:40.921 --> 08:43.891
[ambient music]

08:43.924 --> 08:50.931
*

08:58.972 --> 09:00.974
- Yeah, but nothing
was stolen?

09:01.008 --> 09:03.811
Okay, uh, Bob will take
your statement, Mr. Crumm.

09:03.844 --> 09:04.812
Okay.

09:04.845 --> 09:07.748
Hey, Bob!
Line one.

09:07.781 --> 09:08.916
Yes?
Can I help you?

09:08.949 --> 09:11.585
- Hi, there, uh,
my name is Mike Painter.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.120
- Oh! Hi.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.055
Uh--my mom saw you
on Dr. Phil

09:15.088 --> 09:16.624
and got very excited.

09:16.657 --> 09:17.758
I-I mean,
I saw you, too.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.027
So, uh,
what brings you here?

09:20.060 --> 09:21.795
- I was actually wondering
if I could--

09:21.829 --> 09:23.363
- Holy shit.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.065
- [chuckles]
Yeah.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.934
- Wow.
Mike Painter.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.702
- Gary.
- It's good to see you.

09:28.736 --> 09:31.204
- Actually, uh, I was hoping
we could have a quick word.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.205
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.374
- We'll go to my office.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.709
- Nice to meet you.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.077
- It was a pleasure
to meet you, too.

09:37.110 --> 09:40.113
[phone ringing,
keys clacking]

09:41.915 --> 09:43.784
- Right?
- Yeah, it's--

09:43.817 --> 09:45.686
[both chuckle]

09:45.719 --> 09:47.721
- Okay, so Billy Reese
was on first.

09:47.755 --> 09:50.724
And then, uh, there was
someone--some kid on second,

09:50.758 --> 09:52.893
and you were on third.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.662
Yeah, and you don't remember.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.997
- No, no, no, no,
I-I remember.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.100
So they went and
elected you sheriff.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.669
This is--
- Yeah.

10:01.702 --> 10:02.936
- Congratulations.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.972
- Look, it's not exactly
the wild west.

10:05.005 --> 10:08.008
I mean, we got drunk people
doing drunk things, and--

10:08.041 --> 10:09.810
Right now there's
some mystery man--

10:09.843 --> 10:12.713
he's, uh--he's going around
breaking into houses

10:12.746 --> 10:14.114
without stealing anything.
I don't know. it's just...

10:14.147 --> 10:16.083
- Didn't the Manson Family
do that?

10:16.116 --> 10:17.851
- Uh, past troubles aside,

10:17.885 --> 10:19.186
we're a little bit
more "Partridge Family"

10:19.219 --> 10:20.854
than Manson Family
around here,

10:20.888 --> 10:23.123
but enough on all that.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.025
What about you?

10:25.058 --> 10:27.260
We've--w-w-we've kept on you.
I-I even read your book.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.996
- Oh, man, that's, um--

10:29.029 --> 10:32.666
that's kind of you.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.035
Well, speaking
of past troubles, you know,

10:35.068 --> 10:38.872
Gary, I was hoping I could take
a look at those files.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.746
- Do you mind if I ask why?

10:45.779 --> 10:48.682
I mean, it's been, uh...

10:48.716 --> 10:51.985
28 years since they dragged
those kids out of the woods.

10:56.289 --> 10:59.760
- Yeah, minus their teeth.

10:59.793 --> 11:03.764
- Look, Mike, all--
all I'm saying is that, uh,

11:03.797 --> 11:05.265
a lot of folks,

11:05.298 --> 11:08.702
just like you and your mom,
lost people back then.

11:08.736 --> 11:11.772
So...

11:11.805 --> 11:14.474
I'm not saying no.

11:14.507 --> 11:17.711
I guess I'm just saying,
why now?

11:17.745 --> 11:19.112
- I'm writing a book.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.714
- Really?

11:23.216 --> 11:25.886
Is it gonna be a good book?

11:25.919 --> 11:28.221
- I hope so.

11:28.255 --> 11:32.225
- What I mean is, is it
gonna be a respectful book?

11:32.259 --> 11:34.227
- Above all else.

11:34.261 --> 11:36.163
Absolutely.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.099
- Mike, you know that I-I didn't
get stuck here, right?

11:39.132 --> 11:41.835
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, that's...

11:41.869 --> 11:44.872
- But did you know
that I married Jessica Hale?

11:44.905 --> 11:45.906
- I did hear that.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.240
- She would be right annoyed

11:47.274 --> 11:49.877
if I didn't invite you
for dinner tonight.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.178
- No.
- No, no, no. No, no, no.

11:51.211 --> 11:55.949
There's a lot of
people coming, and, uh...

11:55.983 --> 11:58.351
and I think I can help you
with those files.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.220
But...

12:00.253 --> 12:03.290
I need your expert opinion
on my kid.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.093
Yeah, I-I-I think
he's growing up

12:06.126 --> 12:07.995
a little bit strange.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.797
[polite laughter]
- Do we have a casino?

12:09.830 --> 12:11.331
Weren't we supposed to get one,
a casino, in this town?

12:11.364 --> 12:13.000
- We don't build anything here.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.267
- Well, whose fault is that?
- I'll tell you.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.036
- Oh, here we go.
- Steam to diesel.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.338
When the railroad switched
from steam to diesel,

12:18.371 --> 12:20.974
that is what killed us.
- No. Community.

12:21.008 --> 12:22.843
How kids are raised.

12:22.876 --> 12:25.913
Now everything's
all disconnected.

12:25.946 --> 12:28.148
- What?
Now everything's all connected.

12:28.181 --> 12:31.284
- Now any perv
can reach through the Wi-Fi

12:31.318 --> 12:33.186
and grope my daughter.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.855
We don't even keep
a TV in the house.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.156
- I'll tell you
something else.

12:36.189 --> 12:39.026
This is not even a town.
It's a museum.

12:39.059 --> 12:41.895
- But you got to modernize.
Take the station.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.931
[chuckling]
If the county gave us funds,

12:43.964 --> 12:45.232
what we could do with that.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.867
- Well--yeah,
and when you're sheriff,

12:46.900 --> 12:48.235
I think you should do that.
- Oh.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.003
When I'm sheriff,
the first thing I do is

12:50.037 --> 12:52.239
take down that stupid painting
in your office.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.374
- She's got you there.
- I know.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.343
- Dad?
- I love this town.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.345
I absolutely love it.
I love it just the way it is.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.180
And you know that--
Hey, buddy.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.015
- Katie's been watching TV
forever.

13:02.049 --> 13:04.818
I want to watch "Labyrinth."

13:04.852 --> 13:06.253
- It's a tough life, bud.
- Dane, honey,

13:06.286 --> 13:08.055
you tell your sister
it's time for bed.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.990
And you too--
no more TV.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.159
- [groans]

13:12.192 --> 13:13.793
- Good night.

13:16.063 --> 13:17.064
Don't.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.298
- Mike.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.000
I mentioned this earlier.

13:20.033 --> 13:22.202
That kid is obsessed
with David Bowie.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.071
- [snickers]
- [scoffs]

13:24.104 --> 13:25.372
- That's strange, right?

13:25.405 --> 13:27.875
- You're lucky it's not ABBA.
[laughs]

13:27.908 --> 13:29.877
- I wouldn't worry about it.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.312
- See?

13:32.345 --> 13:35.448
- I mean,
we were pretty strange,

13:35.482 --> 13:39.186
remember?

13:39.219 --> 13:42.322
- We had our own
imaginary kingdom.

13:42.355 --> 13:45.926
You and Eddie made it up.

13:45.959 --> 13:48.862
And you were the kings,
both of you.

13:50.097 --> 13:52.933
And the card game
that never ended.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.868
- What's that?

13:54.902 --> 13:57.104
- Well, me and Eddie
started playing cards one day--

13:57.137 --> 14:00.007
uh, War,
and this one game just...

14:00.040 --> 14:02.209
went on and on.

14:02.242 --> 14:03.877
There was no winner.

14:03.911 --> 14:05.412
So, um,

14:05.445 --> 14:08.448
we picked it up the next day
and the next.

14:08.481 --> 14:11.318

I think we just wanted to see

14:11.351 --> 14:13.186
how long it would go on.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.488
- How long did it?

14:15.522 --> 14:18.058
- Well, I guess technically
it still is.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.261

every Saturday,

14:22.930 --> 14:24.364
me, you, and Eddie

14:24.397 --> 14:27.267

Why don't we ask him?

14:37.010 --> 14:38.311
What do you think?

14:38.345 --> 14:40.981
Too much TV bad for kids?

14:41.014 --> 14:43.050
- Of course it is.
Where's the bathroom?

I don't know, it's one of these
fancy labels, right?

16:00.593 --> 16:01.761

talking about?

I walked around. I...

parent to parent,

30:26.592 --> 30:29.161
what are you not telling me?

30:32.631 --> 30:35.467

30:35.501 --> 30:37.536
- Say it.

30:37.569 --> 30:40.472
- That show may have
something to do with this.

30:44.110 --> 30:45.344
"Candle Cove"?

to tell me where you went

30:59.225 --> 31:00.459
last night after you left.

a television show, okay?

31:05.531 --> 31:06.899
It did something
to my brother,

31:06.933 --> 31:09.135

do odd things.

one that's putting this--

after the hospital.

the first night.

I had what's called

31:39.565 --> 31:42.601

stress reaction.

a psychotic episode, Mike.

one last time.

32:00.719 --> 32:03.189
What did you do,
and where did you go last night?

32:03.222 --> 32:05.357

It's connected to that show.

something.

don't understand now.
