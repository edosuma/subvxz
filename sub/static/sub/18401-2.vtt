08:09.663 --> 08:10.881
There are no fucking rounds.

08:10.925 --> 08:11.926
This is a fight to the death!

08:11.969 --> 08:13.580
[quietly]: Fuck.

08:14.929 --> 08:16.583
[sighs] Okay, fine.

08:16.626 --> 08:18.367
I'’m sorry. [sighs]
This is my first fight.

08:20.195 --> 08:22.676
Are you fucking

08:22.719 --> 08:24.460
kidding me?I'’m sorry.
I'’m sorry, okay?

08:24.504 --> 08:26.506
Fucking shit.
Do you understand

08:26.549 --> 08:29.030
what'’s at stake here,
you little bitch?

08:29.073 --> 08:31.293
I...Do you have any idea
what the cartel would do

08:31.336 --> 08:33.991
if they found out how fucking
inept you are at your job?

08:34.035 --> 08:35.079
I'’ll tell you what they'd do.

08:35.123 --> 08:37.865
Bang. Bang.

08:37.908 --> 08:39.170
Bang.

08:39.214 --> 08:40.694
Okay, so...

08:40.737 --> 08:43.174
That'’s a fucking gunshot.Yeah, I get it.

08:43.218 --> 08:44.828
You'’re dead.No, I'’m... Yes, I'm dead.
You know what?

08:44.872 --> 08:46.656
By way of gunshot.I-I'’m dead...

08:46.700 --> 08:48.876
You bled out from the head
and from the dick.

08:48.919 --> 08:50.312
And joke'’s on them, okay?

08:50.355 --> 08:52.227
I'’m gonna die at
the head shot.

08:52.270 --> 08:53.663
I'’m not gonna feel either
of the two dick shots.

08:53.707 --> 08:55.535
[sighs]
I'’m gonna go outside

08:55.578 --> 08:57.014
and I'’m gonna
find this bird.

08:57.058 --> 08:59.103
If I don'’t find it,
I'’m gonna come back

08:59.147 --> 09:01.323
and we'’re gonna think of a
solution to fix this problem.

09:01.366 --> 09:03.064
If you don'’t find
the fucking bird,

09:03.107 --> 09:04.805
don'’t bother coming back.

09:04.848 --> 09:06.981
Okay. You know, honestly,

09:07.024 --> 09:09.810
your leadership
skills are lacking.Oh.

09:09.853 --> 09:12.943
You'’re not incentivizing
me to fix this problem.

09:12.987 --> 09:14.641
Fuck you. Pussy.

09:16.817 --> 09:19.515
Wow. [whistles]

09:19.559 --> 09:22.300
Señor Feathers.
Hola, Señor.

09:22.344 --> 09:24.041
Maybe she'’s a singer.

09:24.085 --> 09:26.304
Why would a singer be doing
a police ride-along?

09:26.348 --> 09:29.003
If she was doing
a album of cop songs,

09:29.046 --> 09:32.223
like The Police?

09:32.267 --> 09:34.356
They don'’t sing about
cops, they'’re just...

09:34.399 --> 09:35.705
Here she comes,
we should...Oh.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.925
D-D-D-Doughnuts.

09:37.968 --> 09:39.361
Uh-oh.Okay.

09:39.404 --> 09:41.798
I got all the things.Here we go.

09:41.842 --> 09:44.192
Look at... this.

09:44.235 --> 09:45.715
Wow.Oh, my goodness.

09:45.759 --> 09:47.195
Blueberry,
old-fashioned.Yo.

09:47.238 --> 09:49.153
And you--
what is your specialty?

09:49.197 --> 09:50.633
I actually won'’t.
I'’m-I'm trying

09:50.677 --> 09:52.809
to dodge the
old gluten.Oh, come on.

09:52.853 --> 09:55.159
Come on.No, I'’m sorry.
No, I really...

09:55.203 --> 09:57.205
One little tiny bite.I got to stay the
course. I mean...

09:57.248 --> 09:59.076
Just, like, a tiny,
tiny one, just a little...

09:59.120 --> 10:00.687
No, I really shouldn'’t.
I shouldn'’t. I...

10:00.730 --> 10:01.992
Oh, really?Really, yeah,
but thank you.

10:02.036 --> 10:03.472
I respect your restraint.

10:03.515 --> 10:05.605
Thank you.Fine.

10:05.648 --> 10:07.084
I mean, you look like
you'’re in pretty good shape

10:07.128 --> 10:09.521
anyway.Well, thank you.
You know, you got to...

10:09.565 --> 10:12.089
You got to keep it, uh...
you got to keep it tight-ish.

10:12.133 --> 10:14.352
You know, things can
get real at any moment.

10:14.396 --> 10:15.963
Listen to him.You know. So...

10:16.006 --> 10:17.660
Oh, look at those biceps.I'’m... It's, uh...

10:17.704 --> 10:20.663
Just, like, giving us
raw cop vibes.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.491
I wish my co-star
was more like you.

10:22.534 --> 10:24.928
Wait. I just got,
like, the craziest idea.

10:24.972 --> 10:27.409
Here we go.

10:27.452 --> 10:28.976
I think you should
be in the show.

10:29.019 --> 10:31.935
What show?Like, you should play
a cop in the show.

10:31.979 --> 10:33.676
Ooh.You should be, like, one of
the main characters in my show.

10:33.720 --> 10:34.677
In your show?In my show, yeah.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.026
No, I can'’t do that.

10:36.070 --> 10:38.986
Yeah, 100%.
The director would love you.

10:39.029 --> 10:40.683
Mm.She'’s so
into, like,

10:40.727 --> 10:44.469
realness and, like,
not acting like an actor.

10:44.513 --> 10:45.775
Well...You'’re like a real cop.

10:45.819 --> 10:47.385
I ama real cop.I... yeah.

10:47.429 --> 10:49.126
Yeah.It'’s perfect.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.127
Really?Mm-hmm.

10:50.171 --> 10:50.954
What about that chin?

10:50.998 --> 10:52.434
Oh, especially

10:52.477 --> 10:53.696
because of the chin.

10:53.740 --> 10:56.917
I mean, strong jawlines are out.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.049
Mm.
Hmm.Everyone wants, like...

10:59.093 --> 11:01.486
you know, like a chin
that'’s just, like, soft

11:01.530 --> 11:03.271
and-and unassuming,
and that, like,

11:03.314 --> 11:05.621
it just sort of, like,
melts into the neck. Yeah.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.014
Everyone wants that?

11:07.057 --> 11:09.190
Oh, yeah.
That'’s the thing now.Hmm.

11:09.233 --> 11:10.713
You know what?
[chuckles]

11:10.757 --> 11:12.715
We should take a headshot.No. I mean, no.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.238
Yeah, we should do,
like, a quick headshot.

11:14.282 --> 11:15.500
Yes, we should.That'’s crazy.

11:15.544 --> 11:17.111
Don'’t you think?For him.

11:17.154 --> 11:18.721
Okay. What should I do?So, like...

11:18.765 --> 11:20.549
Okay.That, like, it'’s, like,
you want to bone

11:20.592 --> 11:23.204
and you, like, have a secret.

11:23.247 --> 11:25.206
I want abone, or I...?You want to bone.
You want to, like...

11:25.249 --> 11:26.424
I want tobone.You want to bone me.

11:26.468 --> 11:27.948
And you have a secret.Okay, okay.

11:27.991 --> 11:29.340
Like, that'’s how
you look at me.Okay.

11:32.604 --> 11:33.954
[shutter clicks]

11:33.997 --> 11:36.478
Oh, nailed it.

11:36.521 --> 11:38.001
Yeah?Nail...
Yeah, one take.

11:38.045 --> 11:39.916
Look at you.Oh, I could do
more. I mean...

11:39.960 --> 11:42.745
[laughs] Listen to you.
You'’re, like, giving me options.

11:42.789 --> 11:45.008
I mean...You are a
director'’s dream.

11:45.052 --> 11:46.662
This headshot
is perfection.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.403
Okay. Hmm.

11:48.446 --> 11:50.448
Except you have,
like, a little...

11:50.492 --> 11:52.886
I can-I can
touch that up,

11:52.929 --> 11:55.497
but you have, like,
a little eyelash right here.Oh.

11:58.108 --> 12:00.284
Oh, you smell great.
Do you wear cologne?

12:00.328 --> 12:02.591
Yeah.Yeah, it'’s...
Keep doing that.

12:02.634 --> 12:03.897
Okay.
All right, make a wish.

12:03.940 --> 12:06.769
Okay.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.510
Oh, you'’re so cute.
He'’s so cute.

12:08.553 --> 12:10.381
He just closed his eyes.No, I mean...

12:10.425 --> 12:12.079
That was like a real wish?Yeah.

12:12.122 --> 12:13.645
Oh, my God.

12:13.689 --> 12:15.299
My heart just broke in half.

12:15.343 --> 12:17.171
I can'’t, with you.

12:17.214 --> 12:18.912
No.I literally
can'’t.

12:18.955 --> 12:21.436
Shouldn'’t have to.Oh. I think
you'’d be a really good dad.

12:21.479 --> 12:22.654
Really?Yeah, '’cause you kind of

12:22.698 --> 12:25.005
are giving me DILF vibes.Oh.

12:25.048 --> 12:27.311
MARCO [on radio]:
Agent Code Name Goldilocks,
I need a rooster,

12:27.355 --> 12:30.488
browny-black, stat. HELEN: Where am I gonna
get a rooster now?

12:30.532 --> 12:32.534
MARCO:
I don'’t know, Helen,
but you'’re my support,

12:32.577 --> 12:33.796
so how about supporting me
and trying

12:33.840 --> 12:35.406
to find me a fucking rooster?

12:35.450 --> 12:37.321
HELEN:
All right, fine. I'’m on it.

12:37.365 --> 12:38.801
MARCO:
Jesus, everything'’s
a fucking drama with you.

12:38.845 --> 12:39.541
[hangs up]MARCO: Hello?

12:42.979 --> 12:44.546
I'’m so sorry. I forgot.

12:44.589 --> 12:45.939
We have to record
this session. [laughs]

12:45.982 --> 12:47.592
Oh, really?Mm-hmm.

12:47.636 --> 12:49.725
Mm. Buh-buh-puh-puh.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.379
Two. Two. Yeah.

12:51.422 --> 12:53.947
Two. Okay. Okay.

12:53.990 --> 12:55.600
So, uh, just to recap--

12:55.644 --> 12:59.082
the camera on your laptop
recorded you...

12:59.126 --> 13:00.954
I was masturbating.

13:00.997 --> 13:02.956
Louder.

13:02.999 --> 13:05.436
I... There'’s
a mic right...Yeah, it'’s old.

13:05.480 --> 13:08.135
It'’s just such an old machine.
[laughs]

13:08.178 --> 13:12.487
I... I was mastur...

13:12.530 --> 13:14.358
I was mas...Just a couple more times.
I think we got it.

13:14.402 --> 13:17.492
I was... masturbat... Okay.

13:17.535 --> 13:18.623
You know what?
I don'’t think we got it.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.277
That...
Well, keep going.

13:20.321 --> 13:22.236
Ugh. So, do you think
that masturbating

13:22.279 --> 13:24.194
for your co-workers was
A: Appropriate,

13:24.238 --> 13:25.935
B: Not appropriate,

13:25.979 --> 13:27.850
or C: Not sure?

13:27.894 --> 13:31.027
I wasn'’t masturbating
for my co-workers.

13:31.071 --> 13:33.508
That'’s... I was hacked.

13:33.551 --> 13:35.423
Would you say
C: Not sure, then?

13:35.466 --> 13:37.947
No. I would... I am not
answering the question.

13:37.991 --> 13:39.688
I don'’t believe in the
premise of the question.

13:39.731 --> 13:42.734
Was M-bating
for your colleagues on camera

13:42.778 --> 13:44.824
A: To impress them,
B: To degrade them,

13:44.867 --> 13:46.869
C: To get promoted,
D: Not sure?

13:46.913 --> 13:49.002
[whispering]:
Don'’t say "D."

13:52.744 --> 13:55.008
Okay, I'’m just gonna put "A,"

13:55.051 --> 13:58.446
because, uh, the guys in my
office were really impressed.

13:58.489 --> 14:00.665
A.[recorder stops]

14:05.235 --> 14:06.802
All right.

14:06.846 --> 14:10.066
Ugh!Did I tell you
I'’d find the bird, or what?

14:10.110 --> 14:13.461
Say welcome back
to Señor Feathers.

14:13.504 --> 14:15.463
[laughs]

14:15.506 --> 14:16.681
[sniffles, clears throat]

14:17.291 --> 14:19.075
That'’s not Señor Feathers.

14:19.119 --> 14:20.947
What? Of course it is.It'’s 100% not.

14:20.990 --> 14:23.166
I don'’t know who that bird is,
but it'’s not Señor Feathers.

14:23.210 --> 14:25.603
How do you know?How do I know?

14:25.647 --> 14:28.215
Yeah.I run cockfights. I know
a fucking fighting bird

14:28.258 --> 14:30.478
when I see one. I'’m the
Jay Gatsby of cockfighting.

14:30.521 --> 14:32.349
This bird may as well
have a fucking iron spike

14:32.393 --> 14:34.090
shoved up its ass and
be on the top of a barn.

14:34.134 --> 14:35.787
Okay. Wow.[bird coos]

14:35.831 --> 14:39.748
Wait. Did you just
fucking coo at me?Nah.

14:39.791 --> 14:41.228
You little bitch.I don'’t think so.

14:41.271 --> 14:43.230
What, are you fucking
trying to imprint on me?No.

14:43.273 --> 14:45.275
I'’m not your new mom, you
piece of garbage shit bird.

14:45.319 --> 14:47.408
[sniffs]

14:47.451 --> 14:49.801
Where did you get
this fucking bird?

14:49.845 --> 14:52.021
What?It smells shampooed.

14:52.065 --> 14:53.588
Nah.Is this someone'’s
fucking pet?

14:53.631 --> 14:55.329
I don'’t think so.You don'’t think so?

14:55.372 --> 14:58.375
I-I know it'’s not.It smells like
ocean breeze.

14:58.419 --> 14:59.855
Uh, maybe Señor Feathers
was just on vacation.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.378
Where the fuck did
you get this bird?

15:01.422 --> 15:03.467
Okay, okay, fine, all right?

15:03.511 --> 15:06.906
It'’s not Señor Feathers. Busted.
You got me, all right?

15:06.949 --> 15:09.691
I got it from the zoo, okay? The
San Diego Zoo. I'’ve got a guy

15:09.734 --> 15:11.258
who hooks me up
with animals.

15:11.301 --> 15:13.260
Listen to me, you
fucking turd person.

15:13.303 --> 15:15.610
While you were skipping around
the San Diego Zoo, I got word

15:15.653 --> 15:18.004
that Big Boy is feeling better,
and the fight is back on

15:18.047 --> 15:20.267
for tomorrow night.
Meanwhile, we'’re sitting here

15:20.310 --> 15:21.877
with our fucking
dicks in our hands

15:21.921 --> 15:24.445
with a bird from the
fucking petting zoo.

15:24.488 --> 15:26.751
It'’s the premier zoo
in the western hemisphere.

15:26.795 --> 15:29.232
Shut the fuck up.
We have 24 hours[sighs]

15:29.276 --> 15:31.321
to turn this soft cock
into a fighting bird,

15:31.365 --> 15:33.845
or he is dead and
we are fucking dead.

15:33.889 --> 15:36.631
Do you understand that part--
that we will cease to live?

15:36.674 --> 15:38.285
Okay.Our lives will be
taken from us.

15:38.328 --> 15:39.721
Okay, you'’re being
really negative,

15:39.764 --> 15:41.592
and I don'’t want to
say anything, but it might be

15:41.636 --> 15:43.899
affecting the bird'’s
performance in the ring.

15:43.943 --> 15:47.903
Oh, suck my dick.I am literally doing
the best that I can,

15:47.947 --> 15:49.557
and I would appreciate
your support.

15:49.600 --> 15:52.995
If this was my best,
I would kill myself.

15:53.039 --> 15:55.693
So, yes, one time we had to
sleep in the same bed. We had...Oh.

15:55.737 --> 15:57.304
Really?Yeah, it was...

15:57.347 --> 15:59.088
On a fishing trip, or...?Yeah, it was
fishing, yeah.

15:59.132 --> 16:00.220
Yeah. Oh, okay.Oh, yeah.

16:00.263 --> 16:02.004
Wow.Hey.

16:02.048 --> 16:04.180
Hey.Where'’d you go?

16:04.224 --> 16:06.835
Huh? Oh, nothing.
Just cop stuff. [laughs]

16:06.878 --> 16:08.141
He had to empty
his pee bottle.

16:08.184 --> 16:09.838
Oh, my God. Really?Yeah.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.100
You-you guys
pee in bottles?

16:11.144 --> 16:12.667
Mm-hmm.For real?

16:12.710 --> 16:14.364
Mm-hmm.
Wow.
Yeah, yeah,
we have to.

16:14.408 --> 16:15.844
You know, we stay here
for such long hours,

16:15.887 --> 16:17.454
you know, we got to...
got to go, and then we...

16:17.498 --> 16:18.760
We empty it when we
get the chance. Yeah.

16:18.803 --> 16:20.675
Wow. That'’s
so intense.Yeah.

16:20.718 --> 16:22.807
So, I don'’t...
[sighs]

16:22.851 --> 16:25.201
I want to... I want
to ask you guys something,

16:25.245 --> 16:26.594
but I just...
I think it'’s...

16:26.637 --> 16:28.074
It'’s, like,
kind of awkward.

16:28.117 --> 16:29.684
No.Come on, we'’ve been talking.

16:29.727 --> 16:31.120
Nothing is weird.
What is...?Oh, it'’s silly.

16:31.164 --> 16:33.731
Um... can-can I hold your gun?

16:33.775 --> 16:35.690
Oh.

16:35.733 --> 16:37.257
No. I'’m sorry. It's...Oh.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.041
it'’s, like, weird.[laughing]

16:39.085 --> 16:41.435
No, no, no. No, it'’s
okay. It'’s okay.It'’s like...

16:41.478 --> 16:43.045
It'’s just, the
department, uh, you know--

16:43.089 --> 16:44.612
it'’s pretty strict about
that kind of thing.Yeah.

16:44.655 --> 16:46.048
Yeah.Oh, yeah.
I mean, as they should.

16:46.092 --> 16:47.354
Right.It'’s, like, a gun.

16:47.397 --> 16:48.659
You know, I don'’t really
believe in them,

16:48.703 --> 16:50.313
and I would never own a gun

16:50.357 --> 16:51.706
in my-in my real,
actual life...

16:51.749 --> 16:53.621
Right....but I'’m playing a cop,

16:53.664 --> 16:56.885
and I have to, you know,
be authentic and-and...Yeah.

16:56.928 --> 16:58.800
Maybe I'’m-I'm just, like,
being too actressy,

16:58.843 --> 17:00.062
and I'’m just, like, you know...No, no, no, no, no.
And I would love

17:00.106 --> 17:02.238
to help you. I mean,
I'’d really... I mean,

17:02.282 --> 17:04.327
really, but, you know,
rules are rules, so...Yeah, yeah.

17:04.371 --> 17:06.547
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.Totally. Totally get it.

17:06.590 --> 17:09.506
I get it.
It'’s fine.

17:09.550 --> 17:11.508
Well, maybe just
for a second...Oh, my gosh,

17:11.552 --> 17:14.381
that would be awesome.No, no. I mean...

17:14.424 --> 17:16.426
No. I mean, we... we...

17:16.470 --> 17:17.732
Yeah.
I'’ll just...No. Look, how about this,

17:17.775 --> 17:19.690
how about this,
how about this.

17:19.734 --> 17:22.389
Here we go. I will
take out the bullets,

17:22.432 --> 17:24.347
and then, you can...
you can have a quick hold.

17:24.391 --> 17:26.045
No.No?

17:26.088 --> 17:27.524
No, it'’s not, like...
I'’m just...

17:27.568 --> 17:29.048
I'’m really just searching

17:29.091 --> 17:31.702
for that, like,
authentic police experience.

17:31.746 --> 17:33.182
Mm.And I just want

17:33.226 --> 17:34.705
the real thing, you know?

17:34.749 --> 17:36.925
Like, I want to hold
a real firearm...

17:36.968 --> 17:39.493
like yours... you know?

17:39.536 --> 17:41.016
Yeah.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.626
I just want to know
what that feels like.

17:42.670 --> 17:43.888
Yeah.Yeah.

17:43.932 --> 17:45.847
I get it.

17:45.890 --> 17:47.936
Well...

17:47.979 --> 17:50.982
just for a second.

17:51.026 --> 17:52.201
Okay, Dad.Okay?

17:52.245 --> 17:54.421
Okay.Okay.

17:54.464 --> 17:57.859
Here we go. Safety'’s on.

17:57.902 --> 17:59.730
Feels so good.Yeah. I'’ll just...

17:59.774 --> 18:01.341
Oh, my God.Oh. Let me take it back.

18:01.384 --> 18:04.344
Wow. It'’s just...

18:04.387 --> 18:05.649
So, there'’s this one scene.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.129
It'’s, like, my opening scene.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.696
You know, it'’s, like,
my big scene.

18:08.739 --> 18:12.134
And I have to, like,
go in with two guns

18:12.178 --> 18:14.267
and, like, shoot
the bad guys.Mm.

18:14.310 --> 18:15.311
You know, with a gun
in each hand.

18:15.355 --> 18:16.704
Can I...? Do you mind?

18:16.747 --> 18:17.922
Yeah, sure.I don'’t think...
No, no.

18:17.966 --> 18:20.273
Oh, my God, thank you.You'’re welcome.

18:20.316 --> 18:21.535
This is fucking
intoxicating.

18:21.578 --> 18:23.319
Yeah, it can be.
It can be.Yeah.

18:23.363 --> 18:25.060
Whoa.Okay, we'’ll grab
'’em back, huh?

18:25.104 --> 18:28.150
Oh, my God.
Just, like, give me a minute.

18:28.194 --> 18:31.153
[Jessica inhales
and exhales loudly]

18:31.197 --> 18:32.676
You know
what'’s crazy?

18:32.720 --> 18:35.418
I could just,
like, snap,

18:35.462 --> 18:37.072
and, like, kill you both
right now.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.595
[laughing]:
Isn'’t that insane?

18:38.639 --> 18:40.467
So...
Okay, uh, lady,
you'’re scaring me.

18:40.510 --> 18:42.208
Can I please have
my gun back?

18:42.251 --> 18:44.253
Thank you.[yelling]

18:44.297 --> 18:45.602
Bang!

18:45.646 --> 18:47.126
Okay.

18:47.169 --> 18:48.257
You'’re dead!

18:50.955 --> 18:52.914
Okay, now that your partner'’s
dead, what do you do?

18:52.957 --> 18:57.484
Uh, in this situation here,
uh, uh, you shot my partner.

18:57.527 --> 18:59.355
Mm-hmm, yeah.I would check his vitals.

18:59.399 --> 19:01.183
His vitals? His vitals?And, uh...

19:01.227 --> 19:03.751
Mm.His brains are everywhere.

19:03.794 --> 19:05.361
Well, maybe
you just grazed me.

19:05.405 --> 19:07.058
Shut the fuck up!

19:07.102 --> 19:09.583
You'’re dead!

19:09.626 --> 19:11.672
Not a peep.

19:11.715 --> 19:13.761
Close your eyes.

19:13.804 --> 19:15.502
Be dead.

19:17.721 --> 19:19.680
So, now what?

19:19.723 --> 19:21.072
Well, I would
negotiate with you

19:21.116 --> 19:23.292
i-in a calm and
reasonable manner.

19:23.336 --> 19:25.381
I don'’t even know what you mean.
There'’s no negotiating.Hmm.

19:25.425 --> 19:28.297
Okay, I see.
Hypothetically, I get it.No, this is...

19:28.341 --> 19:30.908
There'’s no hypothetical. This is
the reality of the situation.

19:30.952 --> 19:33.911
You gave me
your loaded gun,

19:33.955 --> 19:37.828
and now it'’s pointed
at your skull.Hmm.

19:37.872 --> 19:39.221
That'’s what's happening
right now.

19:39.265 --> 19:40.831
So you do what I say.

19:40.875 --> 19:43.834
Mm. Mm-hmm.And I say...

19:43.878 --> 19:45.227
What do I say?

19:45.271 --> 19:46.576
Doughnuts.

19:46.620 --> 19:48.230
Sure.The doughnuts.

19:48.274 --> 19:50.145
Do you remember those?Yeah. Yeah.

19:50.189 --> 19:54.323
Yeah. See, earlier, I wanted
you to eat the doughnuts.Yeah.

19:54.367 --> 19:56.760
You were like,
"Mm, no, thank you."

19:56.804 --> 19:58.588
Huh.[chuckling mockingly]:
"No, I'’m gluten-free."

19:58.632 --> 20:00.503
Like a little pussy.Right.

20:00.547 --> 20:02.418
But now you'’re gonna eat
the fucking doughnuts.

20:02.462 --> 20:04.377
Okay.So pick up the doughnut,

20:04.420 --> 20:06.248
stick it in your fucking mouth,

20:06.292 --> 20:07.684
and chew.

20:07.728 --> 20:10.078
Go.

20:10.121 --> 20:13.429
Faster. Eat it faster.

20:13.473 --> 20:15.083
Come on. Eat up, boy.Okay.

20:15.126 --> 20:18.521
Eat '’er up.
Come on, come on. Eat up.[grunts]

20:18.565 --> 20:20.741
Eat it faster.

20:20.784 --> 20:23.352
All right, now you need
something to wash it down.

20:25.702 --> 20:27.487
Hmm.

20:27.530 --> 20:29.663
How about... how about that...

20:29.706 --> 20:31.839
the bottle of piss
that'’s under your seat.

20:31.882 --> 20:33.754
Oh, I emptied mine
out earlier, so...

20:33.797 --> 20:35.364
Oh, right, you did.
But your partner didn'’t.Yeah.

20:36.496 --> 20:38.672
Get the piss bottle.

20:38.715 --> 20:41.805
Don'’t talk. Get
the piss bottle.

20:41.849 --> 20:44.243
You took it out, didn'’t
you? Emptied it out.No. No. He didn'’t.

20:51.162 --> 20:52.773
I don'’t need to drink the piss.

20:52.816 --> 20:54.122
Drink his piss.I don'’t... There's...

20:54.165 --> 20:55.776
Drink his fucking piss!

20:55.819 --> 20:57.778
Now!Okay.

21:01.129 --> 21:04.175
Drink it up.
Drink it up.

21:05.873 --> 21:08.441
Why didn'’t you fucking
empty your bottle?

21:08.484 --> 21:10.181
Don'’t talk to him. He's dead.

21:10.225 --> 21:11.966
Drink it up.

21:12.009 --> 21:14.142
[retches]

21:21.018 --> 21:23.238
Okay, Hazel?Yeah.

21:23.282 --> 21:26.372
Um, my computer was hacked.
That'’s the offense here.

21:26.415 --> 21:29.375
The fact that I was masturbating
with whatever pillowsUgh.

21:29.418 --> 21:32.856
doesn'’t even matter. It-it
shouldn'’t be on trial.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.423
I-I shouldn'’t be on
trial here for that.

21:34.467 --> 21:36.599
Totally. No one wants this
to go to trial.

21:36.643 --> 21:38.819
That'’s why we're here.
Next question.

21:38.862 --> 21:40.690
Do you have cultural reasons

21:40.734 --> 21:43.127
for masturbating?
Yes or no?

21:43.171 --> 21:45.608
Okay, Hazel, um...

21:45.652 --> 21:48.263
you, like, showed up
really unexpectedly

21:48.307 --> 21:50.309
in the middle of me working,

21:50.352 --> 21:52.659
and-and then
you make me say the word

21:52.702 --> 21:54.225
"masturbation,"
like, ten times,

21:54.269 --> 21:56.576
which is so
embarrassing for me.

21:56.619 --> 21:59.579
I feel like you, who is in HR,

21:59.622 --> 22:01.711
in sensitivity training,
is, like...

22:01.755 --> 22:03.713
like, one of the most
insensitive people.

22:03.757 --> 22:06.107
This is, like, really upsetting.

22:06.150 --> 22:08.457
Do you get that I'’m, like,
really upset by this?

22:08.501 --> 22:10.981
Are you upset?Yes!

22:11.025 --> 22:12.722
What are you,
freaking autistic or something?

22:16.987 --> 22:19.599
You shouldn'’t have called me
freaking autistic.

22:19.642 --> 22:21.775
I'’m sorry.
I-I shouldn'’t have said that.

22:21.818 --> 22:23.385
So, we have to get
another form...

22:23.429 --> 22:26.083
because you did that... to me.

22:26.127 --> 22:28.259
Hate speech.

22:28.303 --> 22:31.219
The autistic one'’s an A-24.
That'’s a big form.

22:31.262 --> 22:32.916
Do you have dinner plans
tonight?

22:32.960 --> 22:34.831
No.Well, cancel them.

22:45.581 --> 22:47.104
All done? Yeah?

22:47.148 --> 22:52.109
Yeah, all done.
All done. No more.

22:52.153 --> 22:53.676
Which one was your favorite?

22:53.720 --> 22:55.939
Huh?Which one
was your favorite?

22:55.983 --> 22:58.551
Um, the-the third
one to the last.

22:58.594 --> 23:00.553
Antepenultimate.

23:00.596 --> 23:03.077
Yeah. Yeah.Yeah, that'’s what that means.

23:03.120 --> 23:05.558
Third one to last.
Antepenultimate.Uh-huh.

23:05.601 --> 23:09.126
And fourth to last
is preantepenultimate.Okay.

23:09.170 --> 23:11.302
I love words.
It'’s kind of pretentious, but...

23:11.346 --> 23:13.261
you know us actors.

23:13.304 --> 23:15.959
Words are our weapons.

23:16.003 --> 23:18.353
So, how are we
gonna get out of this?

23:18.397 --> 23:21.922
We'’ve established
that I'’m the one in power

23:21.965 --> 23:23.489
and you'’re weak as fuck.

23:23.532 --> 23:24.925
Right.Right?

23:24.968 --> 23:26.709
Yeah.Can you say that?

23:26.753 --> 23:29.669
Say, "I'’m weak as fuck,
like a widdle baby."I'’m...

23:29.712 --> 23:31.192
I'’m weak as fuck.

23:31.235 --> 23:33.499
Like a widdle baby.Like a little baby.

23:33.542 --> 23:35.370
Like a widdle baby.

23:35.414 --> 23:36.893
Like a widdle baby.

23:36.937 --> 23:38.460
[laughing]:
That'’s right.

23:38.504 --> 23:39.940
So, I guess the only way

23:39.983 --> 23:42.421
to really get out of this
is to beg.

23:42.464 --> 23:44.118
You want me to beg? Okay.Beg for your fucking life.

23:44.161 --> 23:45.554
Okay. I'’m s...

23:45.598 --> 23:47.469
I'’m sor... Could you
please not shoot me?

23:47.513 --> 23:49.471
[coughs]Don'’t fucking cough.

23:49.515 --> 23:51.908
Or swallow.

23:51.952 --> 23:53.693
Or blink...

23:53.736 --> 23:55.738
you corpse.

23:55.782 --> 23:58.785
You'’re not taking
me seriously.

23:58.828 --> 24:00.569
No, I am.This is crazy.

24:00.613 --> 24:03.398
No, I am.After all this time,
you'’re treating me like this?

24:03.442 --> 24:06.445
I-I... No, you'’re not a joke.Like I'’m a fucking joke?

24:06.488 --> 24:07.794
Is that what'’s happening
right now?No, no, no, you'’re not a joke.

24:07.837 --> 24:09.273
Beg for your fucking life!

24:09.317 --> 24:11.275
Three, two, one!Wait, no, no, no!

24:11.319 --> 24:12.712
Please don'’t shoot me!
Please don'’t shoot me!

24:12.755 --> 24:14.801
I'’m so sorry. Please,
I beg you. I beg you.

24:14.844 --> 24:16.803
Please. Please,
let me live.

24:16.846 --> 24:18.457
Please let me live.

24:18.500 --> 24:21.155
I-I have done nothing
worthwhile in my life.

24:21.198 --> 24:23.766
I know that. I haven'’t
done anything good.

24:23.810 --> 24:26.639
And I'’m 42, and that's just
shameful, and I am ashamed.

24:26.682 --> 24:28.684
I am ashamed that I haven'’t done
anything good in my life, okay?

24:28.728 --> 24:30.120
And I was... I meant to.

24:30.164 --> 24:31.644
I always meant to
do something good,

24:31.687 --> 24:34.037
and I just never got...
I just never did it.

24:34.081 --> 24:36.083
'’Cause I... When I was a
kid, I just, I thought...

24:36.126 --> 24:38.520
I thought I would never
grow old, and now I'’m old.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.261
I mean, I'’m half-old,
and I'’m just...

24:40.304 --> 24:41.610
I feel like I'’ve
never done anything.

24:41.654 --> 24:42.916
And I wanted to be in the FBI.

24:42.959 --> 24:44.265
I wanted to be the
head of the FBI,

24:44.308 --> 24:45.919
and I wanted them to name
an airport after me,

24:45.962 --> 24:47.529
but the FBI, they
wouldn'’t take me.

24:47.573 --> 24:49.270
They wouldn'’t take me
when I was younger,

24:49.313 --> 24:50.967
so I'’m hoping I get in
this time, '’cause...

24:51.011 --> 24:52.708
you know, life got in the way.

24:52.752 --> 24:55.450
You know, my dad got sick. You
know, life got really hard,

24:55.494 --> 24:57.496
and I got lazy.

24:57.539 --> 24:58.932
And I know that,
and I'’m... I've been...

24:58.975 --> 25:01.325
I'’m so sorry. I'm...

25:01.369 --> 25:03.284
Feeling this gun
against my head,

25:03.327 --> 25:05.504
I just feel like I-I know...
I know I haven'’t done anything,

25:05.547 --> 25:06.983
and I know I will do something,
please,

25:07.027 --> 25:08.332
if you just don'’t kill me.
I will, I will not...

25:08.376 --> 25:09.595
I will do something good.

25:09.638 --> 25:11.031
I promise you, I promise you,

25:11.074 --> 25:12.946
I will do something good.

25:12.989 --> 25:16.863
Please, please, please, please,

25:16.906 --> 25:19.779
please, please,
please, please,

25:19.822 --> 25:22.738
please, please, please, please,

25:22.782 --> 25:25.132
please, don'’t kill me.

25:25.175 --> 25:27.090
Please.

25:31.878 --> 25:32.922
Okay.

25:34.271 --> 25:35.969
That was really good.

25:36.012 --> 25:38.928
That was totally believable.

25:38.972 --> 25:40.626
[panting]

25:40.669 --> 25:42.410
Thank you.

25:42.453 --> 25:45.587
Um, and thank you for these.

25:45.631 --> 25:48.242
That was awesome.

25:48.285 --> 25:50.070
This was, like, the best.

25:50.113 --> 25:52.638
A once-in-a-lifetime experience.

25:52.681 --> 25:55.075
I will never forget this.
This was so cool.

25:55.118 --> 25:56.772
Okay, thank you.

25:56.816 --> 25:59.862
Thank you. I mean,
I just feel like we had,

25:59.906 --> 26:01.429
I don'’t know, like...

26:01.472 --> 26:03.257
I just feel connected to you
in some way.

26:03.300 --> 26:05.607
I-I don'’t...
Do you feel it, too?

26:05.651 --> 26:08.088
Yeah.Like, maybe we had,
like, a past life...

26:08.131 --> 26:09.872
thing.Yeah.

26:09.916 --> 26:11.918
Yeah. We should hang out.I think so.

26:11.961 --> 26:13.789
I'’d love that.Like, we-we should all hang out.

26:13.833 --> 26:16.400
Like, game night at my house
or something.That'’d be great.

26:16.444 --> 26:18.054
And you can come, too.
Like, it can be so fun.Oh.

26:18.098 --> 26:19.578
Oh, thank you so much.Yeah.

26:19.621 --> 26:21.188
Okay, cool.Okay.

26:21.231 --> 26:23.190
All right.
So, I'’m gonna go,

26:23.233 --> 26:26.236
and, um...
I'’m gonna miss you guys.

26:26.280 --> 26:27.673
So...Well, I-I'’m sorry.
I forgot something.

26:27.716 --> 26:29.370
Um, it'’s time for my cigar.

26:29.413 --> 26:30.893
So...No, no, no, no, it'’s okay.

26:30.937 --> 26:32.112
No. Just...All right.

26:32.155 --> 26:33.417
Okay, bye.Cool.

26:33.461 --> 26:35.550
Okay.Pound it.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.683
[imitates explosions]All right.

26:45.865 --> 26:47.562
Well, I don'’t know about you,

26:47.606 --> 26:49.520
but I'’m not going
to game night.

26:49.564 --> 26:51.218
I'’ll go if you go

26:51.261 --> 26:54.395
and you want me to come
to keep you company, but...

26:54.438 --> 26:56.092
No, I'’m not going
to game night.

26:57.833 --> 26:59.705
You know,
the more I think about it,

26:59.748 --> 27:01.707
I really don'’t like her for you.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.883
I think you can do better.

27:03.926 --> 27:06.842
Well, you know, different.

27:08.931 --> 27:12.587
A little bit
on the wild side.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.894
A little bit.

27:14.937 --> 27:18.027
Well, we learned
that, uh...

27:18.071 --> 27:19.681
Never give your gun
to anyone,

27:19.725 --> 27:22.423
regardless of how nice
they are to you.

27:22.466 --> 27:24.817

Cullen. Cullen.

27:32.085 --> 27:35.392
Cullen.Stop it, Tolbeck.

27:35.436 --> 27:37.438
Oh, my God, I just
realized who that was.

27:37.481 --> 27:40.397
That was Jessica Alba,
the actress.

27:40.441 --> 27:42.356
Oh, my God.
That'’s a great story.

27:42.399 --> 27:45.402
No, it'’s not.
I drank your piss.

27:45.446 --> 27:47.361
Okay, that part of it
is not great, but...

27:47.404 --> 27:49.363
Jessica Alba-- she made
you drink my piss.

27:49.406 --> 27:51.321
That'’s one for
the grandkids.
