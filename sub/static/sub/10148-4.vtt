01:07.610 --> 01:09.779
<i>Tragedy in the world of technology today</i>

01:09.862 --> 01:11.489
<i>with the passing of Robert Vance.</i>

01:11.572 --> 01:13.658
<i>A pioneer in digital technology,</i>

01:13.741 --> 01:15.576
<i>Vance had recently been suffering</i>

01:15.660 --> 01:17.536
<i>from a debilitating brain disorder.</i>

01:17.954 --> 01:19.664
<i>Realizing there was no cure,</i>

01:19.747 --> 01:23.626
<i>Vance spent his final days
creating a bold new computer program.</i>

01:24.168 --> 01:25.878
<i>By digitizing his brain impulses,</i>

01:25.962 --> 01:28.005
<i>it was Vance's dream
to guide his company</i>

01:28.089 --> 01:29.632
<i>from beyond the grave.</i>

01:31.133 --> 01:33.678
Work hard, save your money,
and remember,

01:33.761 --> 01:35.846
the customer is always right.

01:37.181 --> 01:41.352
There are many obstacles to quality,
but don't let them...

02:06.711 --> 02:07.545
Who are you?

02:07.712 --> 02:09.380
I don't have your cornea scan.

02:10.256 --> 02:12.591
I wasn't born when your file was set up.

02:12.675 --> 02:14.343
I'm your grandson, Bobby.

02:16.053 --> 02:17.471
How long have I been in here?

02:17.555 --> 02:19.181
Almost 35 years.

02:19.515 --> 02:21.142
35 years.

02:21.434 --> 02:23.352
I imagine the world's
changed quite a bit.

02:23.811 --> 02:24.811
Oh, yes.

02:24.854 --> 02:28.274
My father, your son, he...

02:29.442 --> 02:30.443
He's gone.

02:30.526 --> 02:31.569
A heart attack.

02:31.652 --> 02:32.862
Itjust happened.

02:34.238 --> 02:35.364
Ah!

02:35.448 --> 02:36.699
So you're alone now.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.201
I'm the last of the family.

02:39.285 --> 02:40.995
I've gotta run the company now,

02:41.078 --> 02:42.538
but I'm not sure I can.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.248
Not sure?

02:44.540 --> 02:48.044
I was no older than you are now
when I started the company.

02:48.878 --> 02:50.921
I know, but you and I
are two different people...

02:51.005 --> 02:52.089
That's enough.

02:52.465 --> 02:53.466
Put me online.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.719
But aren't you gonna help me?

02:56.802 --> 02:57.803
That's what you're for.

02:58.596 --> 03:00.097
That was just a pose, Bobby.

03:00.181 --> 03:01.807
So people would leave me alone.

03:02.058 --> 03:03.434
I needed to buy some time.

03:04.435 --> 03:05.435
For what?

03:06.604 --> 03:07.897
Put me online, and you'll see.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.941
- I don't know if...
- Do it!

03:12.360 --> 03:13.360
Please, Bobby.

03:13.778 --> 03:15.696
I've been cooped up in here a long time.

03:16.447 --> 03:19.575
I wanna find out what's been going on
in the world, that's all.

03:27.625 --> 03:29.251
Doesn't look so bad from up here.

03:29.377 --> 03:30.377
What?

03:31.045 --> 03:32.045
The city.

03:32.088 --> 03:33.964
Kinda reminds me of the Milky Way.

03:35.132 --> 03:38.386
Yeah, the Milky Way,
but with psychopaths.

03:47.520 --> 03:48.813
Elevator, ground floor.

03:49.355 --> 03:51.023
<i>Ground floor.</i>

03:55.069 --> 03:56.069
Alone, at last.

04:04.328 --> 04:05.913
Elevator, emergency stop!

04:06.455 --> 04:07.455
Stop!

04:12.211 --> 04:14.255
Hey, we're still alive.

04:24.098 --> 04:26.138
Gotta be something wrong
with its operating program.

04:28.519 --> 04:29.979
Terry, look.

04:35.693 --> 04:37.069
It's happening everywhere.

04:57.882 --> 04:58.883
What happened?

04:59.425 --> 05:01.093
I must've kicked it over to manual.

05:02.094 --> 05:03.846
Manual? On an elevator?

05:04.263 --> 05:06.515
Yeah, they used to have
these buttons you pressed

05:06.599 --> 05:07.433
for the floor you wanted.

05:07.516 --> 05:08.934
This one must've been retrofitted.

05:09.018 --> 05:10.895
- I bet I can reprogram it-
- Don't!

05:11.937 --> 05:13.022
I gotta get to Mr. Wayne.

05:13.105 --> 05:14.745
This whole place is
operated by computers.

05:14.815 --> 05:15.815
I'm worried.

05:16.484 --> 05:17.485
Then go.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.070
But I'm taking the stairs.

05:32.958 --> 05:35.252
Vance's program
didn't cover its tracks.

05:35.419 --> 05:37.505
Its IP code's all over the grid.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.382
- Sloppy.
- Or maybe it just didn't care.

05:40.591 --> 05:42.343
It's been hoarding information...

05:42.551 --> 05:44.803
Biology, physiology, neurology.

05:45.387 --> 05:46.263
Based on what you told me,

05:46.347 --> 05:48.474
that program's been offline
over 30 years.

05:48.807 --> 05:50.447
Guess it wants to take
a refresher course.

05:50.768 --> 05:52.520
I'm sure it has a hidden agenda.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.856
I suggest you stop wasting time
and go pull the plug.

06:00.945 --> 06:02.404
The door's not working.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.406
I had to shut down the computer

06:04.490 --> 06:06.367
when Vance's program tried to get in.

06:06.575 --> 06:07.677
If you want out of the cave,

06:07.701 --> 06:09.741
you're going to have to do it
the old-fashioned way.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.250
You're kidding.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.293
None of the Robins ever complained.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.231
That rogue program's
taken over the laser defenses.

06:37.356 --> 06:38.941
We can't get near the main switch.

06:39.233 --> 06:40.568
What's our option? Air strike?

06:41.026 --> 06:42.170
Sir, if this place is bombed,

06:42.194 --> 06:44.613
it'll take weeks to restore
full power to the city.

06:44.947 --> 06:47.199
But how else can we stop the thing?

07:34.038 --> 07:35.497
Shoo. Shoo!

08:34.306 --> 08:35.306
Is it <i>gone?</i>

08:42.106 --> 08:43.190
Seems to be.

08:43.649 --> 08:44.650
<i>And What about you?</i>

08:45.109 --> 08:46.110
Still here.

08:46.568 --> 08:47.568
<i>Mostly.</i>

08:47.945 --> 08:49.321
Then you better get going.

08:49.822 --> 08:52.866
The power's off in some parts of town
and you know what that's gonna lead to.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.747
How about giving
these stars in front of my eyes

08:55.828 --> 08:56.870
a chance to go away?

08:56.995 --> 08:58.247
<i>McGinnis.</i>

09:00.416 --> 09:01.416
Right away, boss.

09:23.564 --> 09:24.564
Ha!

09:35.701 --> 09:37.077
You gonna put that back?

09:38.162 --> 09:39.538
Hey, you can't tell us to...

09:41.248 --> 09:42.248
Wrong answer.

09:49.631 --> 09:50.966
As long as the lights are out,

09:51.049 --> 09:52.969
I suggest you go home
and catch up on your sleep.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.356
Hey.

10:07.232 --> 10:08.776
Something wrong with the suit.

10:09.485 --> 10:11.320
<i>I can barely move my leg.</i>

10:11.987 --> 10:13.071
McGinnis?

10:15.407 --> 10:17.701
Now it's the arm.

10:18.327 --> 10:19.327
Did you get that?

10:19.912 --> 10:20.912
Hello?

10:24.958 --> 10:26.001
Can you hear me?

10:26.877 --> 10:29.588
<i>Stop shouting.
I can hear you perfectly well.</i>

10:29.671 --> 10:30.881
Who... Who's that?

10:31.256 --> 10:33.258
<i>Robert Vance is my name.</i>

10:33.801 --> 10:36.094
The computer guy? But you're...

10:36.220 --> 10:38.472
<i>Dead? Rebooted is more like it.</i>

10:39.973 --> 10:42.726
The laser had downloaded you
into my suit's computers.

10:43.852 --> 10:46.563
It's a loose fit,
but I'm sure I'll grow into it.

10:52.444 --> 10:54.363
<i>Don't even try to resist.</i>

10:54.488 --> 10:56.240
<i>The suit's much stronger than you are.</i>

10:56.615 --> 10:57.658
Terry!

10:59.201 --> 11:00.244
Terry!

11:03.622 --> 11:05.707
<i>You're more trouble
than you're worth.</i>

11:06.250 --> 11:08.919
You haven't even seen trouble yet.

11:15.717 --> 11:18.095
<i>You know, I have a feeling
this suit's waterproof.</i>

11:18.554 --> 11:19.972
<i>But I'll bet you're not.</i>

11:24.101 --> 11:27.729
Whatever happens to me,
you can't stay in this suit forever.

11:28.230 --> 11:29.231
He'll stop you.

11:29.773 --> 11:31.900
<i>Whoever he is
won 't have the chance.</i>

11:32.359 --> 11:33.527
<i>I'm only going to be in here</i>

11:33.652 --> 11:36.113
<i>until I can download myself
into a new body.</i>

11:36.655 --> 11:37.656
A new body?

11:38.198 --> 11:39.198
There's no way.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.034
<i>There is a way.</i>

11:41.410 --> 11:43.412
<i>I figured it out
while I was on the grid.</i>

11:43.829 --> 11:46.206
<i>All I need are a subject and my lab.</i>

11:47.082 --> 11:49.918
You really think
you're Robert Vance, don't you?

11:50.002 --> 11:52.129
But he was flesh,
and you're just binary.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.213
They don't go together.

11:53.297 --> 11:54.298
<i>You'll</i> see.

11:55.257 --> 11:56.675
<i>Then again, maybe you won't.</i>

12:11.690 --> 12:12.983
Hey!

12:56.193 --> 12:59.196
It's going to take a while
to reprogram this thing.

12:59.529 --> 13:00.948
Need any help?

13:01.323 --> 13:02.783
You look a little tired.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.243
You try fighting that suit sometime.

13:05.619 --> 13:07.162
We'll wait till tonight then.

13:07.245 --> 13:08.705
I was hoping you'd say that.

13:08.997 --> 13:10.582
It'll be better for me, too.

13:10.666 --> 13:12.501
I've always been
a bit of a night person.

13:13.794 --> 13:15.671
- Oh, one thing.
- What's that?

13:16.338 --> 13:17.798
Can I borrow a pair of pants?

13:43.865 --> 13:45.117
Any luck With the kill switch?

13:45.367 --> 13:46.368
No.

13:46.785 --> 13:48.203
It's dead.

13:50.706 --> 13:51.790
It's my fault.

13:52.249 --> 13:53.559
I should've stayed here and made sure

13:53.583 --> 13:55.377
there was nothing
left of him in that suit.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.212
Can't do anything about it now.

13:58.046 --> 13:59.046
Yes, I can.

13:59.381 --> 14:01.299
He said he needed to use his old lab.

14:03.552 --> 14:05.012
Where do you think you're going?

14:05.804 --> 14:07.806
To Vance's lab, to stop him.

14:08.390 --> 14:09.808
How?

14:10.100 --> 14:11.100
Uh...

14:11.810 --> 14:12.850
I'II figure something out.

14:13.061 --> 14:15.188
Look what the suit did to that wall.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.107
You think you can go up against that?

14:18.608 --> 14:20.318
Sometimes I ask myself

14:20.402 --> 14:23.196
is Batman just a suit
or is it the man inside?

14:24.239 --> 14:25.907
Time to find out.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.202
Terry.

14:37.919 --> 14:39.212
Better take this.

14:39.755 --> 14:41.631
It's got some things
you might be able to use.

14:42.174 --> 14:43.174
Thanks.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.344
I'd give you one of my old costumes,

14:46.428 --> 14:48.305
but most of them are pretty torn up.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.891
You know, bullet holes, burns, gashes.

14:50.974 --> 14:53.518
I know what you're trying to do,
but it won't work.

14:59.107 --> 15:00.233
I'm still going.

15:12.370 --> 15:13.370
- Bobby.
{933931

15:16.416 --> 15:17.584
Who's there?

15:18.335 --> 15:19.335
Batman?

15:19.711 --> 15:20.711
Not exactly.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.466
Don't you recognize your old Granddad?

15:53.662 --> 15:54.662
Yes!

15:59.042 --> 16:00.335
Oh, what happened?

16:00.919 --> 16:03.755
I didn't give you enough sedative,
that's what happened.

16:06.383 --> 16:08.176
What are you doing to me?

16:11.805 --> 16:13.306
It's what I'm doing for you.

16:14.057 --> 16:17.519
See, you're not going to have to worry
about running the company anymore.

16:26.194 --> 16:27.362
Magnet.

16:29.781 --> 16:32.701
That's because
I'm going to be in charge again.

16:32.951 --> 16:34.077
In that suit?

16:36.246 --> 16:37.247
No, Bobby.

16:37.706 --> 16:38.790
In you.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.376
But where will I be?

16:42.711 --> 16:44.629
Wherever deleted programs go.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.395
Nice shot.

19:32.297 --> 19:33.423
500 <i>megs.</i>

19:33.798 --> 19:34.798
<i>1000 kilobytes.</i>

19:35.091 --> 19:36.259
<i>Pi R squared.</i>

19:36.384 --> 19:37.761
<i>Two plus two equals four.</i>

19:38.178 --> 19:39.012
Me first!

19:39.179 --> 19:40.180
I wanna play!

19:41.014 --> 19:43.850
One potato, two potato.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.394
<i>Mama...</i>

19:47.145 --> 19:49.356
<i>Mama...</i>

20:01.409 --> 20:03.578
And in local news,
it's the end of a dynasty

20:03.661 --> 20:06.664
as young Bobby Vance
sells his family's computer company

20:06.748 --> 20:08.458
to a group of outside investors.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.378
<i>Asked how his grandfather
would've reacted to the sale,</i>

20:11.461 --> 20:13.338
<i>the younger Vance
summed it up succinctly.</i>

20:13.421 --> 20:16.174
Look, I've gotta do what I need to do.

20:16.257 --> 20:18.551
Let's let my grandfather
rest in peace, shall we?

20:18.885 --> 20:20.804
Delighted to do that, Bobby. Delighted.

20:21.012 --> 20:22.305
In <i>sports...</i>

20:22.472 --> 20:25.975
The first time I programmed this thing,
it didn't seem to take nearly this long.

20:26.309 --> 20:27.352
It's okay with me.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.187
I can use a rest.

20:31.856 --> 20:34.776
Terry, it's only the suit
that's out of commission,

20:35.235 --> 20:36.653
not Batman.
