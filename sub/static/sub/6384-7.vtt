00:05.630 --> 00:07.390
All right, repeat after me.

00:07.390 --> 00:08.870
I will never...

00:08.870 --> 00:09.720
"I will never...

00:09.720 --> 00:10.720
ever...

00:10.720 --> 00:11.450
ever...

00:11.450 --> 00:14.250
fuck Mia again.

00:14.250 --> 00:16.210
Fuck Mia again.

00:16.210 --> 00:17.370
"Thank you.

00:17.370 --> 00:19.890
Jesus. Just saying it gets me wet.

00:20.920 --> 00:21.870
Fuck you.

00:21.870 --> 00:24.150
Find somebody else to pen your sordid, little fucking tale.

00:24.150 --> 00:25.930
Come on,man. Don't leave. We got a good thing going here.

00:25.930 --> 00:28.720
It's been a long time since I had me a...

00:28.720 --> 00:29.430
friend.

00:29.430 --> 00:30.610
Aw, shucks. I'm almost touched.

00:30.610 --> 00:34.460
But you can't expect me to indulge your every fucking depraved whim !

00:35.360 --> 00:36.390
Jesus Christ.

00:36.390 --> 00:38.610
I just realized what it must be like to live with me.

00:38.610 --> 00:39.780
You know, I-I really didn't think

00:39.780 --> 00:42.570
you were gonna be such a fucking ninny about the whole thing.

00:42.570 --> 00:43.890
Oh,a "ninny" ?

00:43.890 --> 00:46.180
B-because I've had my share of the tang ?

00:46.180 --> 00:49.130
Because I have my own sordid past to contend with ?

00:49.130 --> 00:52.010
No. Because she told me that you guys fucked.

00:54.700 --> 00:56.090
Be that as it may...

00:56.090 --> 00:57.890
repeat after me...

Californication
Season 02 Episode 07

01:46.190 --> 01:48.050
you got to get me out of this shit, Charlie.

01:48.050 --> 01:49.920
I can't get you out of anything, Hank.

01:49.920 --> 01:51.370
You signed a fucking contract.

01:51.370 --> 01:53.280
Since when has that ever mattered?

01:53.280 --> 01:56.960
Look, it's either this or you do the 
adaptation of "fucking & punching.

01:56.960 --> 01:57.780
"Or, wait, no.

01:57.780 --> 01:59.220
I'm sorry. I take that back.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.430
I don't think I can get you that job.

02:00.430 --> 02:01.610
I can't take it anymore.

02:01.610 --> 02:02.630
The guy's gone Kurtz.

02:02.630 --> 02:04.150
He needs a doctor, not a biographer.

02:04.150 --> 02:06.290
No one said you had to move in with the guy.

02:06.290 --> 02:08.570
You never do anything halfway, do you ?

02:08.570 --> 02:11.050
Says the man holding the plastic ass-gina.

02:11.050 --> 02:13.290
What the fuck are we doing here, anyway ?

02:13.290 --> 02:14.440
Hello!

02:14.440 --> 02:20.590
I'm edumacating myself as to the various marketing
opportunities available to the young porn starlet.

02:20.590 --> 02:21.460
Holy shit.

02:21.460 --> 02:23.570
You really like this girl, huh ?

02:23.570 --> 02:25.770
Yeah. Of course I like her.

02:25.770 --> 02:29.320
I like her in the kind, paternal way any agent likes someone

02:29.320 --> 02:30.470
whose career is in his hands.

02:30.470 --> 02:32.930
How about in the kind, paternal way in which a boy some times

02:32.930 --> 02:34.780
likes to stick his pee-pee inside a girl ?

02:34.780 --> 02:36.740
You like her that way,too ?

02:38.030 --> 02:40.300
I kind of did that already.

02:40.300 --> 02:42.060
What ?

02:42.060 --> 02:43.670
Nigga,please !

02:43.670 --> 02:45.890
I had to step in and stunt-cock.

02:45.890 --> 02:47.450
-That's all. -"Stunt-cock" ?

02:47.450 --> 02:48.050
Long story.

02:48.050 --> 02:48.880
You had to be there.

02:48.880 --> 02:50.880
Stunt-cock.

02:51.100 --> 02:52.730
Holy shit,johnny wad.

02:52.730 --> 02:54.150
How we gonna keep you down on the farmnow

02:54.150 --> 02:55.920
that you've penetrated a porn star ?

02:55.920 --> 02:57.110
It was just the tip.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.510
Just the tip, then I popped.

02:58.510 --> 02:59.580
Naturally.

02:59.580 --> 03:00.280
Here's the deal.

03:00.280 --> 03:01.060
This is what we've got to do.

03:01.060 --> 03:04.490
You got to go home and grabcokey smurf, meet me at L.A.X.

03:04.490 --> 03:06.860
We got to getthe hell out of town, palomino.

03:06.860 --> 03:08.340
I mean, we are downthe rabbit hole,

03:08.340 --> 03:11.500
and I'm afraid we ain't never coming back.

03:30.370 --> 03:31.290
Oh, my God !

03:31.290 --> 03:32.810
Are you okay ?

03:32.810 --> 03:33.930
Jesus Christ, lady !

03:33.930 --> 03:34.910
You just came out of nowhere.

03:34.910 --> 03:35.870
You could have killed me.

03:35.870 --> 03:40.120
Looks like I'm gonna have to get your name 
for insurance purposes and what not.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.330
Oh, my God.

03:42.330 --> 03:42.970
You're that asshole.

03:42.970 --> 03:44.090
Why am I not surprised ?

03:44.090 --> 03:47.510
You know, it saddens me to think that when 
you have an internal dialogue about me,

03:47.510 --> 03:50.630
I'm "that asshole" and not "that handsome stranger" or "that guy

03:50.630 --> 03:53.430
who made a mess of my bush -- Hank Moody.

03:53.760 --> 03:56.200
"It's nice to see you again, mrs...

03:56.200 --> 03:57.480
Jones.

03:57.480 --> 03:58.820
Jones ?

03:58.820 --> 03:59.820
Really ?

03:59.820 --> 04:02.820
After all this intrigue, that's kind of a letdown.

04:03.210 --> 04:04.780
Janie Jones.

04:04.780 --> 04:05.960
Oh, like the clash song.

04:05.960 --> 04:07.240
That's fantastic.

04:07.240 --> 04:08.650
I'm half-chubbed.

04:08.650 --> 04:10.780
What do you say we forget about this whole "vehicular manslaughter" thing

04:10.780 --> 04:12.650
and I buy you a drink ?

04:12.650 --> 04:13.890
Yeah, I don't think so.

04:14.610 --> 04:17.250
You know,I really thought that the threat of
 legal action was gonna do it,

04:17.250 --> 04:21.290
but it looks like I'm gonna have to employ
 my considerable powers of seduction.

04:22.050 --> 04:23.080
You ready ?

04:23.080 --> 04:24.620
Oh, yeah.

04:27.790 --> 04:28.500
I got nothing.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.230
That's it. I'm out.

04:30.230 --> 04:33.480
No, tomorrow night, in Venice, Marat.

04:33.480 --> 04:35.770
I'll be the one staring into the bottomless pit of despair.

04:35.770 --> 04:38.150
Get there early before I wet myself.

04:38.150 --> 04:39.750
Oh, yeah !

04:39.750 --> 04:41.810
Nailed it!

04:41.810 --> 04:44.540
Oh, that's right --I still got it.

04:44.540 --> 04:45.400
Okay.

04:45.400 --> 04:48.740
I shouldn't be telling you guys this, but Becca is my absolute favorite.

04:48.740 --> 04:49.660
Oh, thank God !

04:49.660 --> 04:53.260
I-I thought you were gonna come down on her 
for being a satanistor something,so.

04:53.260 --> 04:54.110
Oh, please.

04:54.110 --> 04:57.480
I think it's safe to say that whole thing's just a phase,and, you know,

04:57.480 --> 05:01.380
it probably has something to do with whatever 
might be going on between you two.

05:03.060 --> 05:07.230
I'm sorry. She made referenceto some changes at home.

05:07.230 --> 05:13.270
Well, um, long story short, um, we were 
together, and now we're apart.

05:13.270 --> 05:14.230
Again.

05:14.230 --> 05:15.460
So, you're divorced ?

05:15.460 --> 05:16.450
Not exactly.

05:16.450 --> 05:17.360
It's okay.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.040
I'm not judging.

05:18.040 --> 05:20.110
You know, I'm divorced.

05:20.110 --> 05:21.350
Pretty recently, actually.

05:21.350 --> 05:22.660
-Oh, I'm sorry. - Right on !

05:22.660 --> 05:23.810
Hank.

05:23.810 --> 05:26.480
Um, we were never married, so the divorce thing is...

05:26.480 --> 05:27.630
No, but I did ask.

05:27.630 --> 05:29.370
-A number of times. - Okay, not the time or the place, Hank.

05:29.370 --> 05:30.730
I gave her a ring. She gave it back.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.580
I gave it to a homeless woman.

05:32.580 --> 05:34.540
I'm sorry. That's so sad.

05:34.540 --> 05:36.220
It worked out for the homeless woman.

05:36.220 --> 05:38.490
So, um, none of that really matters right now.

05:38.490 --> 05:43.060
What matters is that, um, we're together when it comes to raising Becca.

05:43.060 --> 05:44.370
Well, yes, but not always.

05:44.370 --> 05:46.530
For instance, I want Becca to be a lesbian when she grows up,

05:46.530 --> 05:48.830
and Karen just wants her to be happy.

05:48.830 --> 05:51.590
That's ridiculous. Like, you can't be both ?

05:52.640 --> 05:54.470
A happy lesbian ?

05:55.210 --> 05:56.670
Karen: Classy.

05:56.670 --> 05:58.720
Yeah, I know. You think, with all the money that we spend,

05:58.720 --> 06:02.020
they could afford some proper glassware.

06:03.740 --> 06:06.760
Hey, have you seen Mia lately ?

06:06.760 --> 06:07.540
No. Why?

06:07.540 --> 06:08.870
No more than usual.

06:08.870 --> 06:10.050
Well, what does that mean ?

06:10.050 --> 06:10.910
What does it mean?

06:10.910 --> 06:13.840
W-- I-I don't know . W-what do you mean ?

06:13.840 --> 06:16.470
Well, no , it's just I keep stopping by Bill's to check on her,

06:16.470 --> 06:17.760
and she's never home.

06:17.760 --> 06:21.190
So, I know she likes to hang out
 at Ashby's den of iniquity,

06:21.190 --> 06:22.330
- and so do you. -I have.

06:22.330 --> 06:23.430
I have seen her there.

06:23.430 --> 06:24.100
-Right. -Yeah.

06:24.100 --> 06:26.140
You know, once in a while, not often.

06:26.140 --> 06:28.250
Does she have a boyfriend ?

06:28.250 --> 06:30.490
I don't know. What is this, "sex and the city," girlfriend ?

06:30.490 --> 06:32.390
What's with all the questions ?

06:32.390 --> 06:34.470
Well, it's just, last time she came for dinner,

06:34.470 --> 06:37.610
she was asking me all these questions about dating an older man,

06:37.610 --> 06:41.240
and it was like she was kind of asking my approval.

06:41.240 --> 06:43.470
Well, I hope you shut that shit down immediately.

06:43.470 --> 06:44.360
No.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.390
I mean, why would I ?

06:45.390 --> 06:48.970
You know, it's a perfectly valid life experience if it's the right guy.

06:48.970 --> 06:50.840
Why the fuck would you say something like that?

06:50.840 --> 06:52.630
Why not?

06:52.650 --> 06:55.480
I date done of my professors once.

06:55.480 --> 06:56.480
That's foul.

06:56.480 --> 06:58.730
He was younger than you are now, actually.

06:58.730 --> 07:00.250
I'm nauseous, actually.

07:00.250 --> 07:03.370
The sex was fantastic, actually.

07:03.370 --> 07:05.110
Now you're just trying to get my goat.

07:05.110 --> 07:06.580
Am I getting it ?

07:06.580 --> 07:09.710
Now, you're only gonna have yourself to blame
 if this thing gets out of hand.

07:09.710 --> 07:10.410
What thing ?

07:10.410 --> 07:12.010
This gross "older man" thing.

07:12.010 --> 07:14.240
No. Well ,I want you to keep an eye out.

07:14.240 --> 07:18.180
I mean, make sure that she doesn't go anywhere near Ashby.

07:18.180 --> 07:20.550
That guy is such a fucking scumbag.

07:20.550 --> 07:22.350
Well, he means well, you know?

07:22.350 --> 07:24.610
That sounds familiar.

07:25.250 --> 07:26.740
I got to go..."Phyllis".

07:26.740 --> 07:28.690
-"Goodbye. -You're a dick, you know.

07:28.690 --> 07:30.800
-Okay ,okay, okay, okay, okay. 
-Your hair smells good.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.120
Good.

07:33.190 --> 07:35.320
It smells like lady hair.

07:45.420 --> 07:48.010
Hey yourself, mrs.P.

07:48.010 --> 07:50.660
I just wanted you to know I love your writing.

07:51.300 --> 07:54.460
Quite possibly my four favorite words in the english language.

07:54.460 --> 07:56.610
Hits all the pleasure centers.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.730
Positively rhapsodic.

07:58.730 --> 08:01.480
I didn't think it was appropriate to say it in front of your, um...

08:01.480 --> 08:03.250
your ex-wife, lover, or whatever.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.130
Oh, God. I wish you had.

08:04.130 --> 08:05.430
That would've pissed her off.

08:05.430 --> 08:07.040
You like pissing her off, don't you ?

08:07.040 --> 08:08.410
I do.

08:08.410 --> 08:10.240
I like pissing off my ex, too.

08:10.240 --> 08:10.870
Cool.

08:10.870 --> 08:12.300
Is he watching ?

08:12.970 --> 08:14.340
Yeah, from the window.

08:14.340 --> 08:17.140
Oh, well, I'll make sure to use my good cock.

08:17.140 --> 08:20.300
Just so you know, I'm on my period.

08:20.300 --> 08:23.660
Not sure I needed a verbal on that, for I care very little about such things.

08:23.660 --> 08:25.230
I was in Nam.

08:25.230 --> 08:27.230
God. My ex always cared.

08:27.230 --> 08:28.400
He thought it was dirty.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.520
Oh, it is dirty...

08:29.520 --> 08:31.010
in a good way.

08:31.010 --> 08:34.260
Also, I haven't had much time to trim the hedges lately,

08:34.260 --> 08:35.210
if you know what I'm saying.

08:35.210 --> 08:37.080
I do know what you're saying, and, again, no worries.

08:37.080 --> 08:39.679
I enjoy a generous thicket.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.140
I got to tell you, your feelings about periods

08:44.140 --> 08:47.450
and pubic hair have just made me a bigger fan.

08:47.450 --> 08:48.600
It's what I do.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.680
Anything else you care to disclose ?

08:50.680 --> 08:52.520
I'm very excited about fucking you right now.

08:52.520 --> 08:55.630
Oh, you are a chatty one, mrs. Patterson.

08:57.630 --> 08:59.240
Baby.

08:59.240 --> 09:00.560
Baby!

09:00.560 --> 09:02.700
Look who I found.

09:04.460 --> 09:05.130
Daisy ?

09:05.130 --> 09:06.560
Wh-what happened ?

09:06.560 --> 09:07.310
What's wrong ?

09:07.310 --> 09:10.740
She was sleeping outside in her fucking car !

09:10.740 --> 09:12.020
I didn't want to bother you guys.

09:12.020 --> 09:13.550
I just didn't know where to go.

09:13.550 --> 09:16.420
My fucking manager showed up at my apartment and --

09:16.420 --> 09:17.960
you have a manager?

09:17.960 --> 09:21.070
You remember the guy who was shooting the "Slam Van" stuff ?

09:21.070 --> 09:23.320
That smelly, sleazy fuck ?

09:23.320 --> 09:24.460
That's your manager ?

09:24.460 --> 09:30.010
No, You're my manager. 
He's just a fuckin' scumbag.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.670
And you didn't think this was worth mentioning ?

09:32.670 --> 09:35.410
I was just scared you wouldn't want to work with me.

09:35.410 --> 09:38.190
And then everything just happened so fast.

09:38.190 --> 09:39.510
I'm really sorry, Charlie.

09:39.510 --> 09:40.480
What does he want?

09:40.480 --> 09:41.370
Money.

09:41.370 --> 09:43.110
He wants to be bought out of his contract.

09:43.110 --> 09:44.120
Oh, that's ridiculous.

09:44.120 --> 09:45.650
Clients get poached all the time.

09:45.650 --> 09:48.080
I put you in "vaginatown," I get the commission.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.150
Well, that's exactly what I told him.

09:50.150 --> 09:51.110
And what did he say ?

09:51.110 --> 09:54.230
He trashed my apartment and ate all my food.

09:54.230 --> 09:55.890
I'm just gonna crash in my car.

09:55.890 --> 09:57.640
-I just really don't want to put you guys out.
- No, no, no.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.180
Don't be silly. Don't be silly.

09:59.180 --> 10:01.740
We'll -- we'll make up the guest room.

10:01.740 --> 10:03.530
Just get into bed, baby.

10:03.530 --> 10:05.460
Mommy and daddy will keep you safe.

10:05.460 --> 10:06.450
Marcy!

10:06.450 --> 10:07.640
What ?

10:07.640 --> 10:09.550
She's scared shitless.

10:09.550 --> 10:10.550
Come on, Dais.

10:10.550 --> 10:13.680
I'm too tired to freshen up the fucking guest room.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.140
Mama needs her sleep.

10:31.860 --> 10:33.880
Oh, God.

10:34.320 --> 10:36.440
Oh, that was exactly what I needed.

10:36.440 --> 10:37.520
Well, good for you, lady.

10:37.520 --> 10:39.630
Happy to protect and serve.

10:39.630 --> 10:40.900
What ?

10:40.900 --> 10:43.270
I think I'm gonna cry.

10:43.270 --> 10:44.270
Oh, dear.

10:44.270 --> 10:45.730
Don't do that.

10:47.490 --> 10:48.970
No.It's, uh -- it's not a bad thing.

10:48.970 --> 10:50.420
It's, um...

10:50.420 --> 10:51.970
coming makes me cry.

10:51.970 --> 10:53.140
I mean, on occasion.

10:53.140 --> 10:54.030
I-I-I get that.

10:54.030 --> 10:56.710
I mean, sometimes, after I come, I want to...

10:56.710 --> 10:58.850
weep, you know ?

10:58.850 --> 11:01.320
But, usually, I just nap.

11:01.320 --> 11:02.390
You know ?

11:03.930 --> 11:07.350
You want me to hug you or, uh...

11:07.350 --> 11:09.560
comfort you in some...

11:09.560 --> 11:11.240
fashion ?

11:11.240 --> 11:15.250
No, that's nice of you to offer, but it's --it's not necessary.

11:15.250 --> 11:17.130
Okay.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.560
Hey, where's the shitter in this joint ?

11:22.560 --> 11:25.020
Down the stairs, to the right.

11:37.250 --> 11:39.600
Damien?

11:39.600 --> 11:41.960
Mr. Moody ?

11:44.990 --> 11:47.450
You fucked my mom.

11:47.450 --> 11:50.770
I fucked your mom ?

11:50.770 --> 11:53.880
I fucked your mom.

11:56.730 --> 11:59.030
Did you hurt her ?

12:16.170 --> 12:17.390
Oh,no!

12:17.390 --> 12:19.200
You didn't !

12:20.260 --> 12:21.440
I can explain.

12:21.440 --> 12:22.590
Oh, no, you can't.

12:22.590 --> 12:23.910
It's not what it looks like.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.350
She wouldn't listen to reason.

12:25.350 --> 12:27.490
I didn't see you put up much of a fight there, lover.

12:27.490 --> 12:28.930
You guys have got to stop this !

12:28.930 --> 12:30.990
This is sick and wrong !

12:31.350 --> 12:32.110
Sure.

12:32.110 --> 12:35.280
It's sick and wrong when he does it, but
 it's perfectly fine for you to fuck me.

12:35.280 --> 12:36.280
Stop saying that out loud.

12:36.280 --> 12:37.240
It's not okay.

12:37.240 --> 12:39.050
That's why we never did it again, Mia.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.770
Never say "Never," Hankie.

12:40.770 --> 12:42.350
Okay. I promise I'll never do it again.

12:42.350 --> 12:45.370
You've already done it again like three times!

12:45.370 --> 12:47.280
Far more than that.

12:47.740 --> 12:49.890
Do you want Karen to find out 
about this, young lady ?

12:49.890 --> 12:51.520
I don't know, Hank.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.210
Do you want Karen to find out about this ?

12:53.210 --> 12:56.070
Because finding out about this could 
mean finding out about us,

12:56.070 --> 12:59.920
which could very well mean the death of hope, Hank.

13:22.620 --> 13:24.350
What the fuck is this? 

13:24.590 --> 13:27.610
Kurt fucking Cobain...

13:28.210 --> 13:29.420
played that.

13:29.420 --> 13:30.420
Courtney gave it to me.

13:30.420 --> 13:33.910
I helped her produce a demo, write some songs.

13:33.910 --> 13:35.150
It's yours.

13:35.150 --> 13:37.870
You're giving me Kurt Cobain's 
guitar because you fucked Mia ?

13:37.870 --> 13:42.040
No. I'm giving you Kurt Cobain's guitar because...

13:42.990 --> 13:45.650
you're my only friend, and I, uh...

13:45.650 --> 13:47.290
Wait, no.

13:47.290 --> 13:48.480
Take...

13:48.480 --> 13:49.400
care of it. I mean, you --

13:49.400 --> 13:54.250
you can put Becca through college
 with that fucking thing.

13:55.910 --> 13:57.310
Okay.

13:58.510 --> 14:00.320
You hungry ?

14:00.940 --> 14:02.410
You like crepes ?

14:02.410 --> 14:03.840
I got a new pan I want to try out.

14:03.840 --> 14:07.400
That's what I'm gonna do --I'm gonna make us some crepes.

14:11.190 --> 14:13.870
Becca, it's not half as crazy as it sounds.

14:13.870 --> 14:15.170
Becca: Fuck you !

14:15.170 --> 14:16.390
Okay.

14:16.390 --> 14:19.540
But I think that your language is 
perhaps a tad inappropriate.

14:19.540 --> 14:22.110
Oh, it's fucking appropriate, all right.

14:22.110 --> 14:24.100
Karen, will you -- will you cut me some slack here ?

14:24.100 --> 14:25.530
Do you see me fronting in any way ?

14:25.530 --> 14:27.260
I've admitted that I'm wrong, you know.

14:27.260 --> 14:31.060
Still, I don't think that that 
you don't talk to your old man that way.

14:31.060 --> 14:34.440
Oh, well, you do if he fucked 
your boyfriend's mother.

14:34.440 --> 14:35.760
I didn't know, okay ?

14:35.760 --> 14:37.610
And I don't like all this "boyfriend" talk.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.310
Well, of course you didn't know.

14:39.310 --> 14:42.170
How could you ever be expected to know such a thing ?

14:42.170 --> 14:43.250
Yes. Yeah, you know what ?

14:43.250 --> 14:46.810
You know ,if you look at this thing in a certain light,

14:46.810 --> 14:51.940
the whole mess can be viewed 
as almost entirely your fault.

14:53.780 --> 14:54.580
Come on.

14:54.580 --> 14:56.780
Well, you didn't tell me about the boy
 until the dinner party.

14:56.780 --> 14:58.920
How was I supposed to know who his mother was ?

14:58.920 --> 15:06.000
Oh, well if you were not so preoccupied with sticking
 your dick in any hole that will have you,

15:06.000 --> 15:07.360
you might notice these things.

15:07.360 --> 15:09.650
Yes, but you kicked my dick out of the house.

15:09.650 --> 15:10.970
You made my dick homeless.

15:10.970 --> 15:14.790
And out of doors is a place where penises 
don't generally fare well

15:14.790 --> 15:16.580
in the rain and the wind and all that.

15:16.580 --> 15:18.880
Hank, shut up, okay?

15:18.880 --> 15:23.270
My homeless dick now must seek shelter
 from the storm where and whence it can.

15:23.270 --> 15:26.850
Did she say to you, "Oh, Hank, I love your writing" ?

15:26.850 --> 15:28.920
You see that ? This is why we should be together.

15:28.920 --> 15:30.260
You just know my shit.

15:30.260 --> 15:31.820
- It's perfect. - It's why we shouldn't be together.

15:31.820 --> 15:33.240
She needed a good cry.

15:33.240 --> 15:35.430
She was lonely. What's the harm ?

15:35.430 --> 15:36.770
The harm?

15:36.770 --> 15:39.600
Oh, well,the harm is right there, okay ?

15:39.600 --> 15:41.830
That is the harm -- big harm.

15:41.830 --> 15:45.620
And the worst part is she was defending you.

15:45.620 --> 15:46.620
What do you mean ?

15:46.620 --> 15:48.770
Well, he didn't break it off with her.

15:48.770 --> 15:51.770
He -- he just said that you were a dick 
for sleeping with his mother.

15:51.770 --> 15:52.770
That's legitimate.

15:52.770 --> 15:54.770
But that did not sit well with her

15:54.770 --> 15:58.940
because no one talks shit about her beloved father.

15:58.940 --> 16:01.880
So she broke it off with him.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.760
Fuck.

16:13.590 --> 16:17.020
Don't you dare touch me.

16:19.850 --> 16:22.540
Kurt Cobain played this guitar.

16:22.540 --> 16:26.420
If you treat it right, you'll never have 
to work another day in your life.

16:26.420 --> 16:29.750
You can't buy your way out of this one.

16:29.750 --> 16:34.400
Damien was right -- you are a dick.

16:42.880 --> 16:43.990
Hey, mrs. Patterson.

16:43.990 --> 16:45.330
Is, uh, Damien home ?

16:45.330 --> 16:46.880
He's, um -- he's not here.

16:46.880 --> 16:47.980
He's at band practice.

16:47.980 --> 16:49.000
Do you want to come in?

16:49.000 --> 16:52.110
I-I don't think that would be such a great idea.

16:52.110 --> 16:53.210
Don't let him scare you.

16:53.210 --> 16:54.070
He's a good kid.

16:54.070 --> 16:55.870
He's just very protective of his mother.

16:55.870 --> 16:57.730
That's a good thing.

16:58.210 --> 17:04.599
Well, I mean, we can't let our kids ruin a 
perfectly excellent sexual chemistry, can we ?

17:04.599 --> 17:05.220
Jesus.

17:05.220 --> 17:07.910
You know, when you put it that way, 
it sounds pretty fucking reasonable.

17:07.910 --> 17:10.839
Can you -- can you write that down for me 
for later in case I need to use it ?

17:10.839 --> 17:14.410
Old man, I will go fucking medieval on your ass !

17:14.410 --> 17:15.579
Hey, settle down, Townshend.

17:15.579 --> 17:18.040
I came here to talk to you, mano a mano.

17:18.420 --> 17:19.890
Hey, Damien !

17:19.890 --> 17:21.869
-Come on. - Settle down, buddy.

17:21.869 --> 17:23.099
What is it ?

17:23.099 --> 17:24.390
What can I do for you ?

17:24.390 --> 17:26.349
Let's figure this out. Come on.

17:28.210 --> 17:30.080
Okay. Here we go.

17:30.080 --> 17:31.570
Come on, man.

17:31.570 --> 17:32.540
What can I do for you ?

17:32.540 --> 17:33.150
N-nothing.

17:33.150 --> 17:34.810
There's nothing you can do.

17:35.330 --> 17:37.330
You're dead to me, and Becca's totally dead to me.

17:37.330 --> 17:38.310
Well, that's a shame.

17:38.310 --> 17:43.240
That's a crying shame because she appears
 to be very fond of you.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.150
Really ?

17:46.150 --> 17:47.870
What'd she say ?

17:48.520 --> 17:51.830
Nothing that I could ever repeat without vomiting.

17:52.230 --> 17:54.180
Now, come on. What can we do ?

17:54.180 --> 17:56.100
Let's figure this out.

17:56.100 --> 17:59.000
Okay. First of all, repeat after me.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.530
Okay.

18:01.460 --> 18:03.250
I will never...

18:03.250 --> 18:04.670
"I will never...

18:04.670 --> 18:05.560
ever...

18:05.560 --> 18:07.030
ever...

18:07.030 --> 18:08.720
ever...

18:08.720 --> 18:10.950
ever...

18:11.420 --> 18:13.350
Fuck my mom again.

18:13.350 --> 18:15.300
Fuck my mom again.

18:15.300 --> 18:16.650
Fuck your mom again.

18:16.650 --> 18:19.510
Boys, we don't have to be so quick to...

18:19.510 --> 18:20.730
fine.

18:20.730 --> 18:22.840
Whatever you want.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.520
Okay?

18:24.520 --> 18:26.990
We good ? Anything else ?

18:28.360 --> 18:30.860
What's up with the guitar ?

18:32.620 --> 18:35.260
Ladies, I am home!

18:35.260 --> 18:37.320
Well, if it isn't mr. Big fucking Hollywood agent.

18:37.320 --> 18:40.430
Steal any fucking clients on the way here,
 you bald motherfucker ?

18:40.430 --> 18:42.190
Is everybody okay here ?

18:42.190 --> 18:42.850
Yeah.

18:42.850 --> 18:45.400
I think it's called a "pimp go get.

18:45.660 --> 18:50.060
"Charlie: You come to my house, 
you push around a couple of girls.

18:50.060 --> 18:53.240
You could have called, texted, we work this out ourselves.

18:53.240 --> 18:54.760
You poached my girl.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.990
That skank -- she belongs to me.

18:58.340 --> 18:59.630
Sweetheart, put those fingers away.

18:59.630 --> 19:01.150
Who knows where they've been ?

19:01.150 --> 19:02.560
Oh, wait a second. I fucking do.

19:02.560 --> 19:03.510
They've been in my ass.

19:03.510 --> 19:04.840
Oh, that was one time.

19:04.840 --> 19:05.540
One good time.

19:05.540 --> 19:08.940
Hey, jerk- off, you know what a fucking contract is ?

19:14.600 --> 19:16.560
This is not a very good deal, Daisy.

19:16.560 --> 19:17.820
You think?

19:17.820 --> 19:21.340
Bad news -- you're connected to Gilbert Gottfried here for life.

19:21.340 --> 19:24.670
Good news -- this will never hold up in court, asshole.

19:24.670 --> 19:26.290
Maybe not, Perry mason, but guess what ?

19:26.290 --> 19:28.850
A lot of not- nice shit can happen during that time.

19:28.850 --> 19:31.150
You want to fucking take that chance ?

19:31.580 --> 19:33.900
Motherless cunt bastard !

19:33.900 --> 19:35.720
-Fuck you.
 -Fuck you !

19:36.630 --> 19:37.460
Okay.

19:37.460 --> 19:38.960
You know what ? That wasn't very nice at all.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.350
That's my soy milk, and I have serious dairy issues.

19:41.350 --> 19:42.110
Yes, you do.

19:42.110 --> 19:44.330
I want you out of my house now.

19:44.330 --> 19:47.400
And, you, please put my wife down.

19:47.400 --> 19:48.360
I got no problem with that.

19:48.360 --> 19:50.360
But Daisy -- she's coming with me.

19:50.360 --> 19:51.580
Sweetheart, come on, honey.

19:51.580 --> 19:53.100
We've got a past.

19:53.100 --> 19:55.190
You know that whole speculum 
series we wanted to do ?

19:55.190 --> 19:56.290
I think the time is right.

19:56.290 --> 19:58.910
Come on, honey. Let's make some porn !

19:59.350 --> 20:00.450
How much you want for her ?

20:00.450 --> 20:02.790
She's not a fucking slave, Charlie !

20:02.790 --> 20:04.000
You know what, pal ?

20:04.000 --> 20:05.980
I believe in this girl ! Yeah.

20:05.980 --> 20:08.450
She is gonna bea huge star one day.

20:08.450 --> 20:10.400
"Vaginatown" is just the beginning.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.550
There will be much ruing of this day.

20:12.550 --> 20:13.200
Ruing, right.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.280
Big fucking star.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.640
Jenna fucking Jameson.

20:15.640 --> 20:16.530
Wait a second.

20:16.530 --> 20:17.520
There's fucking chinese !

20:17.520 --> 20:18.940
Big!

20:18.940 --> 20:20.610
Okay, look. It's all gonna be okay.

20:20.610 --> 20:21.960
Everything's cool.

20:21.960 --> 20:23.750
I'm gonna give him some money 
from the emergency fund.

20:23.750 --> 20:24.640
Oh, no, no, no.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.000
No, no, no, no, no. Baby.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.030
Charlie: Baby, you said it yourself --
she's family, okay ?

20:29.030 --> 20:32.040
And that's what the money's for -- emergencies.

20:32.040 --> 20:33.130
I can't let you do this.

20:33.130 --> 20:34.810
What's the alternative, huh ?

20:34.810 --> 20:36.540
You go back with this guy, the next thing you know,

20:36.540 --> 20:39.110
you're starring in your own line of gynecological training films.

20:39.110 --> 20:40.350
Not on my watch.

20:40.350 --> 20:41.790
Okay. Baby. Baby !

20:41.790 --> 20:44.990
-Maybe you could just write him a check. -I will give him wh--

20:49.970 --> 20:52.030
all of it ?

20:52.030 --> 20:54.940
You spent all of it ?

20:54.940 --> 20:58.290
That was my mad money, baby.

21:00.110 --> 21:03.460
Pleasure doing business with you, captain jackass !

21:11.270 --> 21:13.940
I love that car.

21:17.770 --> 21:20.050
I'm sorry, daddy.

21:20.430 --> 21:22.520
I don't know what happened to me.

21:22.520 --> 21:25.110
You're going to your mother's.

21:25.110 --> 21:29.020
But going to my mother's 
makes me want to do drugs !

21:29.020 --> 21:30.000
A lot of 'em !

21:30.000 --> 21:31.900
I don't want to hear it.

21:31.900 --> 21:34.990
It's a good place for you to chill out.

21:39.030 --> 21:40.620
Whatever you say, daddy.

21:40.620 --> 21:44.350
I'll help you knock this monkey off your back, baby.

21:45.180 --> 21:47.410
If you let me.

21:58.980 --> 22:00.560
Where are we going ?

22:00.560 --> 22:01.720
Nowhere.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.470
Just going for a walk.

22:03.470 --> 22:05.250
No one walks in L.A.

22:05.250 --> 22:06.280
We do.

22:06.280 --> 22:08.450
Always have, always will.

22:08.450 --> 22:10.220
We're New Yorkers.

22:10.220 --> 22:11.990
There is no "always.

22:11.990 --> 22:13.940
"There's just right now.

22:14.580 --> 22:17.070
You don't like me very much right now, do you ?

22:17.070 --> 22:18.360
No.

22:18.360 --> 22:20.000
I don't.

22:20.390 --> 22:23.230
You know ,I know I say this too much
 --all the time, probably,

22:23.230 --> 22:31.860
but I was wrong to do what I did, and I was
 wrong to be so glib about trying to fix it.

22:31.860 --> 22:37.460
There is no right or wrong, dad, just the consequences of your actions.

22:37.460 --> 22:39.640
You taught me that.

22:39.640 --> 22:43.870
I guess I don't like the consequences 
of my actions very much right now.

22:43.870 --> 22:45.180
Yeah.

22:45.180 --> 22:47.140
Me neither.

22:49.440 --> 22:51.440
So, uh...

22:51.440 --> 22:54.530
what is it that you like so much about this boy ?

22:54.530 --> 22:55.670
I don't know.

22:55.670 --> 22:57.000
Come on.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.270
It's got to be something.

22:58.270 --> 23:00.200
Use your words.

23:00.650 --> 23:02.340
He's really smart.

23:03.090 --> 23:05.230
Let's not go crazy.

23:05.510 --> 23:07.670
And he makes me feel pretty.

23:07.670 --> 23:08.450
Well, that you are.

23:08.450 --> 23:10.500
You're very pretty. You're beautiful.

23:10.500 --> 23:12.180
Shut up. I'm not beautiful.

23:12.180 --> 23:13.620
Don't say that.

23:13.620 --> 23:14.620
Look.

23:14.620 --> 23:15.450
Don't ever say that.

23:15.450 --> 23:16.770
You are beautiful.

23:16.770 --> 23:18.870
You're the most beautiful thing
 in the world to me.

23:18.870 --> 23:21.150
Then treat me that way.

23:21.150 --> 23:23.510
I'm always on your side, dad, always.

23:23.510 --> 23:25.170
Even when I shouldn't be.

23:25.170 --> 23:26.320
But I'm sick of it.

23:26.320 --> 23:29.210
Get your shit together before it's too late !

23:29.210 --> 23:32.560
I don't care if you and mom never say 
another kind word to each other,

23:32.560 --> 23:35.110
but I'm sick and tired of parenting you both.

23:35.110 --> 23:36.590
I'm a fucking kid !

23:36.590 --> 23:39.290
I don't know what I'm doing half the time.

23:39.290 --> 23:43.790
But I do know this --if you keep cracking
 jokes and taking another drink

23:43.790 --> 23:47.060
and pretending that life is one big, stupid party,

23:47.060 --> 23:50.820
you will miss everything.

23:55.440 --> 23:57.740
Damien: Becca!

24:06.100 --> 24:08.680
You have fun, okay ?

24:10.560 --> 24:12.690
Not too much fun.

24:23.360 --> 24:25.020
Hey, Damien.

24:25.900 --> 24:29.340
You think I might take you down to the guitar 
center and get you something cooler than that one ?

24:29.340 --> 24:31.240
-That's... - no, man.

24:31.240 --> 24:32.180
This guitar is awesome.

24:32.180 --> 24:33.650
It's like...

24:33.650 --> 24:35.990
it's like something Cobain would have played.

24:36.830 --> 24:38.560
Awesome.

24:41.410 --> 24:43.700
Have fun, honey.

24:45.680 --> 24:48.600
May I have another, please ?

24:48.600 --> 24:50.290
I don't think so.

24:50.290 --> 24:51.840
Really ? Am I that sloshed ?

24:51.840 --> 24:54.570
No. But if I'm gonna take you home with me,

24:54.570 --> 24:56.500
I don't want you to beat...

24:56.500 --> 24:58.420
half-mast.

24:59.850 --> 25:01.390
I'm so flattered.

25:01.390 --> 25:04.850
I just don't think I'd be very good
 company for anybody tonight.

25:04.850 --> 25:05.790
Why not?

25:05.790 --> 25:06.790
I've heard good things.

25:06.790 --> 25:08.850
No, I am very agreeable.

25:08.850 --> 25:11.570
And you are nothing if not a beautiful barmaid.

25:11.570 --> 25:15.990
I've just got a little too much of my daughter's
 voice running around in my head right now

25:15.990 --> 25:17.910
to be good company for anybody.

25:17.910 --> 25:21.170
That's not as creepy as it sounds, either.

25:21.170 --> 25:23.060
Honestly.

25:23.060 --> 25:28.200
So, uh, tonight, I think you're just
 gonna have to settle for...

25:29.060 --> 25:30.270
the tip!

25:30.270 --> 25:31.820
Just the tip !

25:31.820 --> 25:32.890
Get it ?

25:32.890 --> 25:34.930
Got it ? Good.

25:34.930 --> 25:36.640
Good night, Hank.

25:36.640 --> 25:38.960
Good night, Beautiful barmaid.

25:43.560 --> 25:45.160
Am I too late ?

25:45.160 --> 25:47.080
Did you already wet yourself ?

25:47.760 --> 25:50.030
So, what are we drinking ?
