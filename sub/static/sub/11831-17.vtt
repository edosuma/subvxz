Previously on The Practice.

00:03.332 --> 00:05.299
Basically, our lawyer
just dropped us.

00:05.366 --> 00:07.366
Five weeks
before the trial?

00:07.432 --> 00:09.599
One week before
the summary judgment
hearing.

00:09.666 --> 00:11.832
- I think we should take it.
- Sorry, Jimmy.

00:11.899 --> 00:14.332
- I think we should
take it too.
- What? Why?

00:14.399 --> 00:16.899
Because 11 people
in a two-mile radius
got cancer.

00:16.966 --> 00:19.499
There are simply no facts
to support the claim.

00:19.566 --> 00:21.799
This is an attorney
who demeans our profession.

00:21.866 --> 00:24.566
Those four people
live within 100 yards...

00:24.632 --> 00:26.766

power lines.

00:26.832 --> 00:30.332
They didn't get sick
because I demeaned
the legal profession.

00:30.399 --> 00:33.866
This complaint does allege
disputable questions of fact.

00:33.932 --> 00:36.799
- <i>Defendants' motion for</i>
summary judgment is denied.
- <i>[ Gavel Raps ]</i>

00:36.866 --> 00:41.266
They've offered us a package
of $995,000.

00:41.332 --> 00:44.399
- They don't admit liability.
- They don't admit
they were wrong?

00:44.466 --> 00:46.766
- No.
- I think this deal stinks.

00:46.832 --> 00:48.532
We're all with Maureen
on this, Jimmy.

00:48.599 --> 00:50.599
Will you continue
to be our lawyer?

00:50.666 --> 00:52.966
If you choose to go forward,
I'll be your lawyer.

00:53.032 --> 00:55.999
I thought I made it
clear on the phone.
I can't help you.

00:56.066 --> 00:58.832
You made it clear
you <i>wouldn't</i> help me.
I'm a drunk.

00:58.899 --> 01:02.866
So you can see
I wouldn't make a very great
expert witness, would I?

01:02.932 --> 01:06.199
- He's sauced.
- But I'll be sober
in the morning.

01:06.266 --> 01:08.366
Thank you.

01:13.166 --> 01:16.766
<i>The defense strategy</i>
<i>is gonna be to attack</i>
<i>our strategy,</i>

01:16.832 --> 01:19.899
which they think
is gonna be all
emotion and sympathy.

01:19.966 --> 01:23.299
It ain't gonna be that.
We're gonna be above that.

01:23.366 --> 01:25.432
I thought our case
basically <i>is</i>
all emotion...

01:25.499 --> 01:27.632
since we're weak
on liability.

01:27.699 --> 01:31.066
Our case is credibility--
who to believe.

01:31.132 --> 01:34.399
When I get up at the end
and say those power lines
gave you all cancer,

01:34.466 --> 01:36.966
the jury
has to believe me.

01:37.032 --> 01:40.899
Are there any other
witnesses besides us?
Are we calling our doctors?

01:40.966 --> 01:44.599
Some.
Most of the medical conditions
have already been stipulated to.

01:44.666 --> 01:46.832
It'll all come down
to causation.

01:46.899 --> 01:50.332
And for that, we have
this Helms guy--
the alcoholic.

01:52.232 --> 01:56.399
- <i>It makes me look fat.</i>
- That was your stomach
making you look fat.

01:56.466 --> 01:58.532
It's a good testifying suit.

01:58.599 --> 02:01.699

but not, like, rich.

02:19.732 --> 02:22.632

I figure we'll get

02:22.699 --> 02:25.099

Pretty much.

02:25.166 --> 02:27.266

Jimmy, if they do offer
anything bigger--

02:30.099 --> 02:34.232
This isn't about getting
a big public apology.
This is about money.

If I could get it to two,

02:36.499 --> 02:38.899

- He will.

- How many experts do they have?
- More than one.

02:46.999 --> 02:52.099

within a half a mile.

05:29.782 --> 05:32.148
They expect me to live.

05:32.215 --> 05:35.182
But have any of the doctors
told you it was caused
by power lines?

05:35.248 --> 05:39.282
They tell me they don't know
what causes cancer.

05:39.348 --> 05:41.582
It could be
something in the air,
something we eat.

05:41.648 --> 05:44.982
Did they rule out
the power lines as a cause?
No, they did not.

05:45.048 --> 05:47.248
Why do you think
it's the power lines?

05:47.315 --> 05:52.015
First, 11 people
in one neighborhood
get cancer.

05:52.082 --> 05:54.215

a coincidence.
<i>Perhaps.</i>

05:59.882 --> 06:03.015

06:03.082 --> 06:06.282
- Objection.
- Testimony goes only to
that he read the study.

06:06.348 --> 06:09.382
He's not testifying
as to the accuracy
of its findings.

06:09.448 --> 06:11.448

as to why this witness
believes--

I heard the question, counsel.
I'm not allowing it.

06:16.748 --> 06:18.915
Any study done in Sweden
has no relevance here.

06:20.915 --> 06:23.682
Mr. Beal, what,
if anything else,

06:23.748 --> 06:27.215
caused you to suspect
the power lines as a cause
for this cancer cluster?

06:27.282 --> 06:32.115
There was a 1990 report
done by the Environmental

06:32.182 --> 06:35.082

<i>Sustained.</i>

that the fact that a study
is said to exist somewhere...

There's some farming
done, too, in Fairfield.
Isn't that right?

07:48.782 --> 07:51.148
Yes.
And they likely use

07:51.215 --> 07:53.248

<i>Pretty much, yes.</i>

Don't you worry about me.

12:05.839 --> 12:07.939
<i>[ Jimmy ]</i>
<i>You can't testify</i>

12:08.006 --> 12:09.973
[ Joel ]
Thank you.
That's helpful.

12:10.039 --> 12:12.039
Just puke
and get it over with.

12:12.106 --> 12:16.339
[ Toilet Flushes ]
I don't know how I'd make it
without your bedside manner.

12:16.406 --> 12:20.606
Never mind.
You're on in two minutes.
Come on then.

12:20.673 --> 12:23.339
Hey. Wash your hands.

12:23.406 --> 12:25.573
[ Sighs ]

12:25.639 --> 12:29.573
<i>[ Water Running ]</i>

12:29.639 --> 12:32.273
<i>[ Joel ] I was a professor</i>
<i>at Boston University</i>
<i>for nine years...</i>

12:32.339 --> 12:35.806
<i>as an epidemiologist</i>
<i>specializing in</i>
<i>radiation research.</i>

12:35.873 --> 12:40.739
Dr. Helms, did you ever have
occasion to study power lines?
Yes, I did.

12:40.806 --> 12:45.239
Did you have occasion to study
the effect of exposure to
power lines on the human body?

12:45.306 --> 12:47.106
I did.

12:47.173 --> 12:50.873
Before we get into
the nature of your study--
'cause it'll take some time--

12:50.939 --> 12:52.806
could you give us
an overall conclusion?

12:52.873 --> 12:57.073
Simply put,
exposure to power lines
is a cancer risk.

12:57.139 --> 12:59.839
You're sure?
<i>There's no question,</i>
<i>Mr. Berluti.</i>

12:59.906 --> 13:02.439
Does it mean living
next to power lines,
you'll get cancer?

13:02.506 --> 13:04.339
Probably not.

13:04.406 --> 13:06.839
But are you
at a greater risk?
Definitely.

13:06.906 --> 13:08.973
<i>And every epidemiologist</i>
<i>knows it.</i>

13:09.039 --> 13:11.606
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Sustained.

13:11.673 --> 13:16.306
Okay, Doctor, this stuff
gets pretty technical.

13:16.373 --> 13:20.206
Let's start
with what exactly is
an electromagnetic field.

13:20.273 --> 13:22.773
A power line,
electrical wiring,

13:22.839 --> 13:24.906
electrical equipment,
a cell phone--

13:24.973 --> 13:29.039
They all give off
what is known as
radio-frequency radiation.

13:29.106 --> 13:31.106
And this is harmful?
It can be.

13:31.173 --> 13:34.106
<i>What this radiation does</i>
<i>is heat body tissue.</i>

13:34.173 --> 13:36.939
If you get too much
and the body can't
dissipate it,

13:37.006 --> 13:40.239
it can cause injury--
sometimes cancer.

13:40.306 --> 13:44.039
Now, to say something
causes cancer--
That's really not fair.

13:44.106 --> 13:46.306
What I should say is,
statistically,

13:46.373 --> 13:48.673
you become at higher risk
for cancer.

13:48.739 --> 13:50.739
Why or how,
we haven't figured out.

13:50.806 --> 13:54.239
And yet, if you haven't
figured it out,
you seem pretty certain.

13:54.306 --> 13:58.506
<i>Four times as many people</i>
<i>living near power lines</i>
<i>get cancer, Mr. Berluti.</i>

13:58.573 --> 14:00.706
Just because we haven't
figured out why...

14:00.773 --> 14:02.606
doesn't mean
we haven't got a problem.

14:05.739 --> 14:07.639
Hey, how's it goin'?

14:07.706 --> 14:11.306
Well, he's been strong,
but looks like he
could use a drink.

14:11.373 --> 14:13.873
Seven hours now.
[ Ellenor ]
Jury's awake?

14:13.939 --> 14:16.006
Oh, yeah. Oh,
let me say this.

14:16.073 --> 14:18.206
Without having heard
what the other side
has to say,

14:18.273 --> 14:21.373
I am not living
near power lines.

14:21.439 --> 14:24.039
Did you report this
to anybody?

14:24.106 --> 14:27.306
<i>Did I report it?</i>
<i>[ Scoffs ]</i>

14:27.373 --> 14:30.306
That's why
I'm in telemarketing today--
because I reported it.

14:30.373 --> 14:33.973
- Who'd you tell?
- I first reported it
to Boston Power.

14:34.039 --> 14:36.006
Then the Environmental
Protection Agency.

14:36.073 --> 14:38.139
Did the agency respond?

14:38.206 --> 14:40.806
<i>Yes. They found my data</i>
<i>to be inconclusive.</i>

14:40.873 --> 14:43.239
They also let me know--
should I compile
any more data--

14:43.306 --> 14:45.306
I should keep it to myself.

14:45.373 --> 14:48.573
- Objection-- hearsay.
- Overruled.

14:48.639 --> 14:51.239
[ Jimmy ]
Who said that, Dr. Helms?
His name was Oliver Rock.

14:51.306 --> 14:54.539
He was a director
of the agency's division
here in Boston.

14:54.606 --> 14:57.106
- Did he say anything else?
- Objection, Your Honor.

14:57.173 --> 14:59.973
Goes only to his response
to the witness's report.

15:00.039 --> 15:03.539
- I'll allow it.
- <i>What else did he say?</i>

15:03.606 --> 15:06.839
<i>He said,</i>
<i>"There are power lines</i>
<i>all across the country.</i>

15:06.906 --> 15:09.206
We don't need to start
a national panic."

15:12.273 --> 15:15.906
Did you see him squirm?
That West guy--

15:15.973 --> 15:19.839
He laid a big, soft Baby Ruth
when I said, "We don't
want to make a panic."

15:19.906 --> 15:23.173
I don't think
he'll be coming at you
with candy bars tomorrow.

15:23.239 --> 15:25.573
Let's go through it again.
And go even harder.

15:25.639 --> 15:29.439
You were fired
for being a drunk,
weren't you, Dr. Helms?

15:29.506 --> 15:31.439
<i>Yes or no.</i>
No.

15:31.506 --> 15:34.306
My battle with alcoholism
began after I was discharged.

15:34.373 --> 15:37.006
My termination had to do
with my unwillingness--

15:37.073 --> 15:39.139
Don't let him go on.
West would be cutting him off.

15:39.206 --> 15:40.639
[ Door Opens ]
Sorry.

15:40.706 --> 15:43.639
Jimmy. Talk to you
for a sec?

15:45.573 --> 15:47.406
Keep goin'.
Grill him.

15:50.973 --> 15:53.073
Hey. Come on in.
Sit down.

15:55.106 --> 15:57.106
I hear it's goin' well.

15:57.173 --> 15:59.473
Tomorrow's the big one.

15:59.539 --> 16:02.906
If Joel can survive cross--
I've gone over
their witness list.

16:02.973 --> 16:06.239
They have some top researchers--
two from California
who've just done a study.

16:06.306 --> 16:08.339
I had Rebecca
run some numbers.

16:08.406 --> 16:10.473
You've put in roughly
400 hours on this case.

16:10.539 --> 16:13.006
<i>That's--</i>
<i>That's conservative.</i>

16:13.073 --> 16:16.739
I bill you
at 125 an hour,
so we can figure 50,000.

16:16.806 --> 16:19.273
Lindsay and Ellenor,
between them, takes it
over a hundred thousand.

16:19.339 --> 16:22.039
<i>And you're up</i>
<i>to 63,000 in costs.</i>

16:22.106 --> 16:25.706
If this trial
goes the distance,

16:25.773 --> 16:28.939
we could be in
for 250,000.

16:29.006 --> 16:30.906
If we could absorb that,
that would be one thing.

16:30.973 --> 16:33.973
But, Jimmy, this case is--
It's running us
into the red again.

16:34.039 --> 16:37.673
Business has been good here.
Criminal business--
nothing high rent.

16:37.739 --> 16:40.673
The big tickets
are the drug dealers.
Our biggest was shot dead.

16:40.739 --> 16:43.273
Since Lindsay's
out of it, nothing new's
coming through the door.

16:43.339 --> 16:45.939
If I could squeeze
a decent offer--
Jimmy.

16:46.006 --> 16:48.139
This list.
Any chance you have,

16:48.206 --> 16:51.939
it depends
on your ability to cross.

16:52.006 --> 16:54.106
Now, I don't mean
to put you down, but--

16:55.706 --> 16:58.373
This isn't your strength.

16:58.439 --> 17:00.806
What do you think I've been
doing for the past month,

17:00.873 --> 17:03.106
staying up till
3:00 or 4:00 in the morning?

17:03.173 --> 17:06.306
I'm ready for these guys.
I understand that, but--

17:06.373 --> 17:10.272
I was thinking, maybe if Lindsay
handled their experts, then that
would give you more time--

17:10.339 --> 17:13.138
That's <i>her</i> idea?
No. She says
you're doing great.

17:13.205 --> 17:15.272
You don't think I'm up
to a case like this.

17:15.339 --> 17:18.373
I got it.
This isn't a reflection
of you, Jimmy.

17:18.439 --> 17:21.039
Oh, that's a lie.

17:24.705 --> 17:26.606
Your case isn't good.

17:27.772 --> 17:31.106
You've made
the most of it so far.

17:31.173 --> 17:33.306
The time could be right
to settle.

17:35.939 --> 17:40.806
<i>He could be right.</i>
<i>We may be at</i>
<i>our strongest now.</i>

17:40.873 --> 17:43.973
We gotta make
a decision here.

17:44.039 --> 17:48.306
Get a number, Jimmy.
Then we'll see.

17:50.706 --> 17:53.306
Morning.
Good morning.

17:53.373 --> 17:56.206
Says Parcells
may be coming back.

17:56.273 --> 17:58.639
I'd sooner welcome back
Don Cherry.

18:01.473 --> 18:04.306
They want two.
You can get out for two.

18:05.739 --> 18:08.973
I'm afraid that would not
be an acceptable number
from our side.

18:09.039 --> 18:13.539
What is?
Nothing.

18:13.606 --> 18:15.839
Is "nothing" good for you?

18:15.906 --> 18:17.673
Come on.
Last week, it was a million.

18:17.739 --> 18:20.339
Things are going
better for us
than you expected.

18:20.406 --> 18:23.673
Two gets you off cheap.
You really don't
get it, do you?

18:23.739 --> 18:27.939
The money
we offered last week
was a premium for silence--

18:28.006 --> 18:30.073
to preempt your people
going to court,

18:30.139 --> 18:32.306
getting their stories
printed in the newspaper.

18:32.373 --> 18:36.573
We're beyond that now.
The only interest we have now
is in winning.

18:36.639 --> 18:39.506
And frankly,
I'm not impressed
with your presentation so far.

18:39.573 --> 18:42.539
So I think you should
recommend "nothing"
to your clients.

18:42.606 --> 18:44.639
Because when I get finished
with Mr. Helms today,

18:44.706 --> 18:48.039
not only
will your case be over,
I'll be moving for costs.

18:48.106 --> 18:52.173
And I very well might get them.
That could cost you
a half a million dollars.

18:52.239 --> 18:56.773
Now, did that thought
ever tiptoe across your mind,

18:56.839 --> 18:58.973
or has it all
been sugarplums?

19:02.506 --> 19:05.506
People like you think
people like me can't beat them.

19:05.573 --> 19:07.473
You're wrong.

19:07.539 --> 19:10.806
I don't doubt
people like you
can win, Mr. Berluti.

19:10.873 --> 19:13.106
Only it won't be this case.

19:24.022 --> 19:26.856
<i>Now, Mr. Helms--</i>
<i>Oh, excuse me.</i>
Dr. <i>Helms,</i>

19:26.922 --> 19:29.622
Are you still a doctor?
Yes.

19:29.689 --> 19:34.422
- You work as a doctor?
- <i>No. As I said yesterday,</i>
<i>I'm in telemarketing now.</i>

19:34.489 --> 19:37.156
You're no longer hireable
as an epidemiologist,
are you, Doctor?

19:37.222 --> 19:39.556
No.

19:39.622 --> 19:42.456
In fact, as a result
of your claims that
power lines cause cancer,

19:42.522 --> 19:44.622
you lost respect within
the medical community.

19:44.689 --> 19:47.289
I became
a political liability.

19:47.356 --> 19:50.089
No other university,
academic or medical
institution would hire you.

19:50.156 --> 19:51.989
It would seem so.

19:52.056 --> 19:54.856
So now you spend your days
making cold calls,

19:54.922 --> 19:59.089
trying to convince people that
maybe they should change their
long-distance telephone company.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.422
[ Jimmy ] Objection.
[ Judge ]
Overruled.

20:00.489 --> 20:04.856
- Are you an alcoholic, Doctor?
- Objection.
- Overruled.

20:04.922 --> 20:07.356
- Are you an alcoholic,
Doctor?
- Yes.

20:07.422 --> 20:09.322
Recovered?
No.

20:09.389 --> 20:11.889
- You still drink.
- Yes.

20:11.956 --> 20:15.656
- <i>Did you drink last night?</i>
- Yes.

20:15.722 --> 20:19.122
- Were you drunk?
- <i>[ Jimmy ] Objection!</i>
- <i>[ Judge ] Sustained.</i>

20:19.189 --> 20:23.056
Well, tell me, Doctor, are there
any other scientists,
to your knowledge,

20:23.122 --> 20:25.156
who would be willing
to come forward...

20:25.222 --> 20:28.589
and affirm your theories
concerning power lines
and cancer?

20:28.656 --> 20:31.422
They won't come forward
because the government
will go after them.

20:31.489 --> 20:34.689
Like they went after you.
Yes, Mr. West.

20:34.756 --> 20:37.389
The government
and the scientific
advisory council...

20:37.456 --> 20:41.856
considered that
it was more expedient
to discredit me...

20:41.922 --> 20:45.689
than to admit that power lines
are a cancer risk.

20:45.756 --> 20:48.822
I must say I'm surprised
the government allows you
to work in telemarketing.

20:48.889 --> 20:51.556
I mean, all those phone lines--
calling people every day,

20:51.622 --> 20:54.122
<i>talking to them,</i>
<i>sharing the real truth.</i>

20:54.189 --> 20:55.456

<i>Sustained.</i>

20:55.522 --> 20:58.556
<i>Do you tell people</i>
<i>that power lines</i>
<i>killed J.F.K.?</i>

20:58.622 --> 21:00.522
Objection!
Sustained.

21:00.589 --> 21:03.089
<i>Doctor,</i>

21:03.156 --> 21:06.189
have you ever
been hospitalized
in a mental institution?

21:06.256 --> 21:08.056
Objection, Your Honor.

21:11.156 --> 21:13.189
I told you.
How the hell
could it not happen?

21:13.256 --> 21:15.789
Guy's a drunk
who did time
in a mental ward.

21:15.856 --> 21:17.889
Lower your voice.
This is stupid!

21:17.956 --> 21:20.356
We're tilting
a windmill here.
And you've never done that?

21:20.422 --> 21:22.922
Does Helms have
any credibility left?

21:22.989 --> 21:25.322
I didn't like the way
the jury was looking at him.

21:25.389 --> 21:27.889
Let's just try to get out--
anything.

21:27.956 --> 21:32.456
We have to cut our losses.
If the clients resist,
I'll talk to 'em.

21:32.522 --> 21:35.956
Well--
What?

21:36.022 --> 21:39.156
They won't be offering
anything, Bobby.

21:39.222 --> 21:41.122
Even before Helms
was crossed.

21:41.189 --> 21:44.189
The defense, they're--
They're offering zero.

21:44.256 --> 21:47.956
Nothing?
They're determined
to go to verdict,

21:48.022 --> 21:50.389
and that was before
they chewed up
our expert witness.

21:50.456 --> 21:53.789
<i>Their only offer is we</i>
<i>give them an agreement</i>
<i>for judgment right now,</i>

21:53.856 --> 21:56.256
they'll drop
any claim they have
for abuse of process.

[ Groans ]
<i>[ Door Opens, Closes ]</i>

22:00.356 --> 22:02.456
Hey.

22:04.389 --> 22:06.456
Hey.

22:10.056 --> 22:13.989
Jimmy, maybe Lindsay
should take their experts--

22:14.056 --> 22:16.556
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>that's a good idea.</i>

22:16.622 --> 22:18.856
<i>The best part of our case</i>
<i>is his relationship</i>
<i>with the jury.</i>

22:18.922 --> 22:20.989
I think
they still like him.

22:25.356 --> 22:28.522
Okay. Don't go
toe-to-toe on science.

22:28.589 --> 22:30.489
All you do
is preserve some doubt.

22:30.556 --> 22:32.756
Keep doubt alive.

22:32.822 --> 22:35.622
Can you do that?
Yeah.

22:35.689 --> 22:39.722
- Are you up on the science if--
- I can do it.

22:42.789 --> 22:45.556
You've studied
the effects of power lines?
For 11 years.

22:45.622 --> 22:47.522
And what conclusions
did you draw...

22:47.589 --> 22:50.856
with respect to cancer
and exposure to power lines
and electromagnetic fields?

22:50.922 --> 22:53.889
- There is no link.
- None?

22:53.956 --> 22:55.822
None.

22:55.889 --> 22:58.456
Are you sure that power lines
cannot cause cancer,
