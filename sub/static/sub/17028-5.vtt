00:02.578 --> 00:04.939
Ladies and waitresses,

00:04.941 --> 00:07.657
I am the great Han-dini!

00:08.214 --> 00:09.948
Somewhere there's
a top of a wedding cake

00:09.949 --> 00:11.454
missing its groom.

00:12.722 --> 00:14.678
I went to traffic school this weekend

00:14.679 --> 00:16.479
and was taught by a magician.

00:16.480 --> 00:18.815
My traffic school was
taught by a comedian.

00:18.816 --> 00:20.450
It wasn't funny, but at least I saw

00:20.451 --> 00:22.885
what Jon Lovitz was up to.

00:22.886 --> 00:25.021
Did you get a DWI?

00:25.022 --> 00:26.289
Driving while itty-bitty?

00:26.290 --> 00:27.356
(laughs)

00:27.357 --> 00:29.859
I ran a series of red lights.

00:29.860 --> 00:33.429
I received word there had
been a Squirtle sighting.

00:33.430 --> 00:35.832
And now, I'm about to pull a rabbit

00:35.833 --> 00:38.000
- out of a hat.
- Big deal.

00:38.001 --> 00:39.968
I just pulled half a
raccoon out of the toilet.

00:42.138 --> 00:43.738
Presto!

00:45.174 --> 00:47.209
This is making me depressed-o.

00:48.211 --> 00:49.979
Where are you?

00:49.980 --> 00:50.979
(bell dings)

00:51.981 --> 00:53.516
Pick up.

00:53.517 --> 00:55.483
Salad with a rabbit on it.

00:59.722 --> 01:03.426
He just can't serve a salad
without a hare in it.

I found a penny.

01:22.962 --> 01:26.265
And our dessert bar is

01:26.266 --> 01:27.866
(gasps) Whoa! "Where are they now?

Pizza Rat!"

01:30.370 --> 01:31.937
Not that. Our piece is right here

01:31.938 --> 01:33.805
next to this <i>Walking Dead</i> ad.

01:33.806 --> 01:35.539
Oh, wait, that's Michael Douglas.

01:45.507 --> 01:47.753
"Caroline Channing's dessert bar"?

01:47.754 --> 01:49.588
This place isn't like
your sex life, Caroline.

01:49.589 --> 01:51.222
You're not doing it all by yourself.

01:52.491 --> 01:54.026
I don't even do it by myself anymore.

01:54.027 --> 01:56.461
I was talking too much,

01:56.462 --> 01:58.697
and, look, I mentioned you right here.

01:58.698 --> 02:00.465
"Partner."

02:00.466 --> 02:02.067
I'm more than just the partner,

02:02.068 --> 02:04.069
I'm the creative inspiration.

02:04.070 --> 02:05.804
I'm Steve Jobs and you're the fat guy

02:05.805 --> 02:06.904
that drives a Segway.

02:08.407 --> 02:09.841
I tried to include you.

02:09.842 --> 02:11.576
I told you the interview was on Monday,

02:11.577 --> 02:13.312
and you said that's your whippit night.

02:13.313 --> 02:15.045
Oh, I whipped it.

02:16.148 --> 02:17.281
Whipped it good.

02:19.985 --> 02:22.987
Caroline, back that ass up.

02:24.690 --> 02:26.992
I don't want anyone
too close to my baby.

02:26.993 --> 02:29.494
Is that why you dipped her in perfume?

02:29.495 --> 02:32.464
I want everyone to treat little Barbara

02:32.465 --> 02:33.965
like Mariah Carey

02:33.966 --> 02:36.268
and never look directly in her eyes.

02:36.269 --> 02:38.836
Is that why she's wearing sunglasses?

02:40.672 --> 02:42.174
I just got off.

02:42.175 --> 02:44.009
And also, I'm done with work.

02:44.010 --> 02:45.510
Okay.

02:45.511 --> 02:47.245
There's my girls.

02:47.246 --> 02:48.880
We're not your girls, Oleg.

02:48.881 --> 02:51.183
I have it in writing from a judge.

02:51.184 --> 02:53.852
Oleg, give her some space.

02:53.853 --> 02:57.055
Her spray tan hasn't even dried yet.

02:57.056 --> 03:00.192
Sophie, I've been reading
a parenting blog called

03:00.193 --> 03:02.961
"So, You've Ruined Your Life,"

03:02.962 --> 03:06.898
and they say it's very important
for a dad to bond with his baby.

03:06.899 --> 03:09.901
I think that's only
true for human dads.

03:09.902 --> 03:12.738
Maybe you can bond with the baby later.

03:12.739 --> 03:14.638
You know, like, when she has a baby.

03:15.640 --> 03:17.675
I can't wait 12 years.

03:19.411 --> 03:20.946
Sophie, I'm her father.

03:20.947 --> 03:22.414
I helped make her.

03:22.415 --> 03:25.183
This wasn't a Virgin Marski situation.

03:25.184 --> 03:27.785
There was nothing immaculate
about this conception.

03:29.287 --> 03:31.123
Well, the fun part's over now.

03:31.124 --> 03:32.957
Yeah, she's mine.

03:36.862 --> 03:38.996
Excuse you.

03:43.502 --> 03:46.537
(thumping and clattering)

03:51.009 --> 03:54.112
She's getting really good
with that thing.

03:54.113 --> 03:56.448
I'm gonna do what I do
when all women tell me

03:56.449 --> 03:57.849
not to be near them.

03:57.850 --> 03:59.717
I'm gonna follow her.

04:01.620 --> 04:04.055
Uh, Caroline Channing?

04:04.056 --> 04:06.124
Hi, I'm Doug Reynolds,
I'm a professor at Wharton.

04:06.125 --> 04:08.059
Hey, I went to Wharton.

04:08.060 --> 04:09.261
Yeah, I know.

04:09.262 --> 04:10.605
I saw your interview in <i>Time Out.</i>

04:10.606 --> 04:12.030
You mentioned it several times.

04:12.031 --> 04:13.165
Once when you were asked

04:13.166 --> 04:14.549
where the dessert bar was located.

04:14.550 --> 04:17.502
Well, it is east of Wharton.

04:17.503 --> 04:19.070
You haven't heard her Wharton song.

04:19.071 --> 04:20.738
♪ Wharton, Wharton, Wharton, Wharton ♪

04:20.740 --> 04:22.563
♪ Wharton, Wharton, Wharton
Wharton, Wharton ♪

04:22.564 --> 04:24.543
Yeah, it's not a great song,

04:24.544 --> 04:27.846
but the story about
how you built your business

04:27.847 --> 04:29.581
from the ashes of your father's infamy,

04:29.582 --> 04:31.216
that's inspiring.

04:31.217 --> 04:32.918
You're the business world's Rudy.

04:32.919 --> 04:34.885
Well, now you're just quoting me.

04:36.321 --> 04:39.324
Hi, I'm "Partner."

04:39.325 --> 04:41.159
Howdy, Partner. (chuckles)

04:41.160 --> 04:42.994
Hey, I teach a business class
over at Penn

04:42.995 --> 04:46.698
because the stock market crashed
in 2008.

04:46.699 --> 04:48.500
I would love it if
both of you would come

04:48.501 --> 04:50.035
and talk to the students.

04:50.036 --> 04:51.902
Like a scared-straight thing?

04:53.071 --> 04:54.539
Not the pen.

04:54.540 --> 04:55.874
Penn, the University of Pennsylvania.

04:55.875 --> 04:57.175
- That's where Wharton is.
- Hmm.

04:57.176 --> 04:58.519
If you'd listen to my whole song,

04:58.520 --> 04:59.940
you'd hear it in the third verse.

05:01.339 --> 05:02.922
We'd pay for your train to Philadelphia

05:02.923 --> 05:04.082
and campus housing.

05:04.083 --> 05:05.884
- Ooh.
- We'd love to come.

05:05.885 --> 05:07.118
Right, partner?

05:07.119 --> 05:08.920
And my parole officer,

05:08.921 --> 05:10.188
mother, guidance counselor,

05:10.189 --> 05:11.372
and the state of Rhode Island

05:11.373 --> 05:13.391
said I'd never go to college.

05:13.392 --> 05:15.126
I can get your email from the website.

05:15.127 --> 05:17.095
I'll send you the info.

05:17.096 --> 05:18.597
We have a site?

05:18.598 --> 05:20.265
I hope there are no nudies of me on it

05:20.266 --> 05:22.129
'cause Larry Flynt owns
the rights to my image.

05:22.130 --> 05:25.804
- You know what this means?
- Uh...

05:25.805 --> 05:27.948
(both) ♪ Wharton, Wharton,
Wharton, Wharton, Wharton ♪

05:27.949 --> 05:30.369

One bong or two?

05:34.280 --> 05:36.648
Max, this is a business trip.

05:36.649 --> 05:39.117
We're not going to Comic-Con
with Woody Harrelson.

05:39.118 --> 05:40.918
Wait, is that on the table?

05:41.987 --> 05:43.588
Anyway, this is your trip

05:43.589 --> 05:44.589
for the dessert bar.

05:44.590 --> 05:46.291
So again, one bong or two?

05:46.292 --> 05:49.427
I am never gonna live down
the "partner" thing, am I?

05:49.428 --> 05:52.764
Like when I threw away those
bath salts to save your life.

05:52.765 --> 05:55.633
(scoffs) I wasn't gonna eat your face.

05:57.002 --> 05:58.904
I am not having this
argument with you again.

05:58.905 --> 06:01.506
I'm not mad about the partner thing.

06:01.507 --> 06:04.309
I'm excited to go to college.
I already told Randy,

06:04.310 --> 06:06.811
and he's gonna send me a care package.

06:06.812 --> 06:09.113
Emphasis on the package.

06:10.615 --> 06:12.651
I broke up
with my high school boyfriend

06:12.652 --> 06:15.587
when I went to college
just to keep my options open.

06:15.588 --> 06:17.589
Pfft, you're in <i>Time Out</i>
<i>New York</i> with Pizza Rat.

06:17.590 --> 06:19.090
What's that loser doing now?

06:19.091 --> 06:22.093
It was Mark Zuckerberg.

06:22.094 --> 06:24.529
Just tell me about
the parties at college

06:24.530 --> 06:26.131
'cause that's the only
reason I'm going.

06:26.132 --> 06:27.832
Oh,

06:27.833 --> 06:30.035
they were epic.

06:30.036 --> 06:31.603
You know what they say,

06:31.604 --> 06:34.039
if you remember the parties at Wharton,

06:34.040 --> 06:35.473
you weren't there.

06:35.474 --> 06:36.874
You weren't here, were you?

06:38.610 --> 06:40.145
- No.
- Okay.

06:40.146 --> 06:42.614
But some of those
all-night study sessions

06:42.615 --> 06:44.182
got pretty punchy.

06:44.183 --> 06:46.017
Like whackadoo.

06:46.018 --> 06:48.687
You're making me punchy right now.

06:48.688 --> 06:51.690
(knocks on door)

06:51.691 --> 06:53.525
Hey, girls,

06:53.526 --> 06:55.193
Oleg isn't here, is he?

06:55.194 --> 06:57.995
Do you hear us screaming
"get out" or "put that away"?

06:59.564 --> 07:02.367
He keeps wanting to bond with the baby.

07:02.368 --> 07:04.869
Why can't he be more
like the men in Poland?

07:04.870 --> 07:07.572
Why can't he be in
Poland is my question.

07:07.573 --> 07:11.042
I mean, they wouldn't even be in
the same room as their baby girl

07:11.043 --> 07:13.878
until it was time to sell her off.

07:13.879 --> 07:16.815
You know, my father's
first words to me were,

07:16.816 --> 07:18.716
"Next item up for bid."

07:19.851 --> 07:21.419
I can't believe I'm saying this,

07:21.420 --> 07:23.555
but Oleg's not wrong here.

07:23.556 --> 07:25.557
He's wrong, literally, everywhere else.

07:25.558 --> 07:26.891
(knocks on door)

07:26.892 --> 07:29.561
Oh, it must be Oleg.

07:29.562 --> 07:33.231
- Hide us.
- Hide you?

07:33.232 --> 07:36.434
That carriage can be seen from space.

07:36.435 --> 07:40.237
All right, tell Oleg I'm
definitely not in the barn.

07:42.240 --> 07:43.375
Yeah, now,

07:43.376 --> 07:44.808
I'm gonna be in the barn.

07:48.580 --> 07:50.382
This is where we put up grad students

07:50.383 --> 07:51.750
and occasional guest lecturers

07:51.751 --> 07:53.585
who are too poor to stay in a hotel.

07:53.586 --> 07:55.353
Losers.

07:55.354 --> 07:56.553
You guys got any towels?

07:57.589 --> 07:58.757
You'll have to forgive Max.

07:58.758 --> 08:00.291
She's just excited to be here.

08:00.292 --> 08:02.360
We know, obviously,
there'll be a bath sheet

08:02.361 --> 08:03.895
and a hand towel for each of us.

08:03.896 --> 08:05.397
Right?

08:05.398 --> 08:07.899
And here's your bedroom.

08:07.900 --> 08:10.035
I'm the RA, but don't worry,

08:10.036 --> 08:11.636
I'm not super uptight.

08:11.637 --> 08:14.372
Just no noise after 10:00
or I'll come at you hard.

08:14.373 --> 08:16.708
You'll have no problems from us.

08:16.709 --> 08:18.810
I was an RA when I went to school here.

08:18.811 --> 08:20.278
I'm Caroline Channing.

08:20.279 --> 08:21.446
The.

08:21.447 --> 08:24.082
Caroline Channing?

08:24.083 --> 08:25.415
You're Buzzkill Channing?

08:26.918 --> 08:29.254
I knew Caroline wasn't your real name.

08:29.255 --> 08:32.289
You're the most legendary
RA we've ever had.

08:32.291 --> 08:34.826
I heard you once threw a kid
out of a second-story window.

08:34.827 --> 08:36.094
That's just a myth,

08:36.095 --> 08:37.962
but a hookah pipe did take flight.

08:37.962 --> 08:39.097
(laughs)

08:39.097 --> 08:40.832
And I was a hookah

08:40.832 --> 08:42.567
by the airport.

08:42.568 --> 08:45.202
Well, it's an honor to
have your here, Buzzkill.

08:47.172 --> 08:49.607
I'm gonna have to search
your trash bag before you leave.

08:49.608 --> 08:52.509
Everything good's gonna be in my butt.

08:53.511 --> 08:55.914
She's fun.

08:55.915 --> 08:57.682
Okay, let's unpack,

08:57.683 --> 08:59.517
get our shower buckets organized.

08:59.518 --> 09:02.587
I'm unpacked. Let's go par-tois.

09:02.588 --> 09:04.656
How many flasks do you have?

09:04.657 --> 09:06.191
I already took two away from you.

09:06.192 --> 09:07.659
Now, you be the audience.

09:07.660 --> 09:09.494
I need to practice my
speech for tomorrow.

09:09.495 --> 09:11.162
We need to party.

09:11.163 --> 09:13.164
Tonight needs to end
with us driving a police car

09:13.165 --> 09:15.667
into a fountain on the
quad or it is a fail.

09:15.668 --> 09:18.002
I am not here to party.

09:18.003 --> 09:20.839
I am here to... to show people

09:20.840 --> 09:23.274
with determination and perspiration,

09:23.275 --> 09:25.844
you can become an inspiration.

09:25.845 --> 09:27.979
Max, what do you think of that?

09:27.980 --> 09:29.347
Max?

09:29.348 --> 09:30.882
Max?

09:30.883 --> 09:33.550
I'm not organizing your shower bucket.

09:40.024 --> 09:41.493
(door opens)

09:41.494 --> 09:43.895
Caroline, are you awake?

09:43.896 --> 09:45.396
No.

09:45.397 --> 09:46.865
It's cool, she's up. Come on in.

09:46.866 --> 09:49.367
(indistinct chatter)

09:49.368 --> 09:52.504
(gasps) Who are these people?

09:52.505 --> 09:54.239
I'm sorry, but we had to leave the bar.

09:54.240 --> 09:55.874
The roof was on fire.

09:55.875 --> 09:57.342
At first we thought the DJ was just

09:57.343 --> 10:00.044
getting the party started,
but it actually was.

10:00.045 --> 10:02.546
Anyway, we'll try not to keep it down.

10:11.499 --> 10:14.502
(indistinct chatter)

10:14.503 --> 10:17.171
Okay, who's next? I washed it out.

10:17.172 --> 10:18.806
Nobody else throw up in this thing.

10:18.807 --> 10:19.874
I mean it.

10:19.875 --> 10:21.409
After I crush this,

10:21.410 --> 10:23.578
you wanna come back to my dorm room?

10:23.579 --> 10:25.179
I have a junior suite.

10:25.180 --> 10:26.814
You're sweet, Junior

10:26.815 --> 10:29.183
but I have a boyfriend
who could be your father.

10:29.184 --> 10:31.686
He also could be my father,
I've never met the man.

10:31.687 --> 10:33.754
Uh, Buzzkill, 3:00.

10:33.755 --> 10:35.089
Just a minute, young man.

10:35.090 --> 10:37.391
There is no underage drinking here.

10:37.392 --> 10:39.393
This is college.

10:39.394 --> 10:41.195
(cell phone ringing)

10:41.196 --> 10:42.597
Hello?

10:42.598 --> 10:44.098
Oh, hi, Oleg.

10:44.099 --> 10:45.867
I lost Sophie again.

10:45.868 --> 10:48.436
She's like a sexy set of car keys.

10:48.437 --> 10:50.404
(gasps) Hey!

10:50.405 --> 10:52.673
No random, uncommitted sex here.

10:52.674 --> 10:54.607
This is college.

10:57.211 --> 11:00.915
I have a computer full of
videos that says you're wrong.

11:00.916 --> 11:02.850
CAROLINE (over phone):
Oleg, I can't talk now.

11:02.851 --> 11:05.186
I have my own problems.
I don't know where the RA is,

11:05.187 --> 11:06.787
so I've had to step up.

11:06.788 --> 11:09.656
We're like the Marines
of no funny business.

11:10.791 --> 11:13.895
(gasps) That better not be a joint.

11:13.896 --> 11:16.963
(sniffs) Yeah, that's
a doobie, brother.

11:18.399 --> 11:21.235
Sophie won't even let me feed Barbara.

11:21.236 --> 11:23.804
She says fathers aren't equipped
for the job.

11:23.805 --> 11:26.607
Well, she does have a point.
You don't have boobs.

11:26.608 --> 11:29.944
Anyone ever tell you
you're a real buzzkill?

11:29.945 --> 11:31.746
(gasps) I have to go.

11:31.747 --> 11:33.646
I hear zippers unzipping.

11:36.450 --> 11:38.313
Were you just on the phone
with Poison Control?

11:38.314 --> 11:40.181
Because I told you,
Steve's gonna be fine.

11:42.423 --> 11:45.092
See? Breathing, I think.

11:45.093 --> 11:47.595
Now take off your top and
shotgun a beer with me.

11:47.596 --> 11:49.931
Max, my speech is tomorrow,

11:49.932 --> 11:52.600
and this top gets a lot of compliments.

11:52.601 --> 11:55.136
I just want you to have
fun at college for once.

11:55.137 --> 11:56.437
Can you do that for me?

11:56.438 --> 11:58.005
I do things for you all the time.

11:58.006 --> 11:59.389
You remember when I told your date

11:59.390 --> 12:00.695
it was Chestnut that farted.

12:00.696 --> 12:01.943
Fine.

12:01.944 --> 12:04.312
If I have one drink,
will you roll Steve out of here

12:04.313 --> 12:05.678
and get everyone to leave?

12:09.517 --> 12:11.819
All: (chanting) Buzzkill!

12:11.820 --> 12:14.689
(electronic music playing)

12:14.690 --> 12:17.024
- Whoo!
- All: (cheering)

12:17.025 --> 12:19.994
Who's the buzzkill now, bitches?

12:19.995 --> 12:22.196
(cheering)

12:22.197 --> 12:23.664
Ah...

12:23.665 --> 12:26.701
corrupting dorks is meaningful work.

12:26.702 --> 12:30.705
Who wants to see me
pretend bang Steve again?

12:30.706 --> 12:32.974
(cheering)

12:32.975 --> 12:34.675
Do it for real!

12:34.676 --> 12:37.178
(laughs)

12:37.179 --> 12:38.713
Caroline, what are you doing?

12:38.714 --> 12:40.181
You of all people should know,

12:40.182 --> 12:41.682
you can't have a party here.

12:41.683 --> 12:42.850
This is college.

12:42.851 --> 12:45.519
Pfft, get off my back, narc.

12:45.520 --> 12:47.353
Ooh, who's this?

12:51.859 --> 12:53.726
My fiancé.

12:55.529 --> 12:58.466
Guess we gotta make it even.

12:58.467 --> 13:02.570
♪

13:02.571 --> 13:03.870
Oh, my God.

13:05.673 --> 13:08.376
Oh, my God, I love College Caroline

13:08.377 --> 13:10.745
so much more than all other Carolines.

13:10.746 --> 13:15.949
♪

13:24.630 --> 13:27.366
(exhales) Damn, college is fun.

13:27.367 --> 13:29.434
I'm glad I went.

13:31.771 --> 13:33.639
Oh, no, I'm late!

13:33.640 --> 13:36.409
That's impossible.
You haven't had sex in years.

13:36.410 --> 13:39.311
Also, you look like
an Italian grandmother.

13:44.584 --> 13:46.586
(gasps and screams) Oh, my God!

13:46.587 --> 13:48.221
Who did this to me?

13:48.222 --> 13:49.589
This was the compromise.

13:49.590 --> 13:50.957
They wanted to shave your head.

13:50.958 --> 13:52.191
(gasps)

13:52.192 --> 13:54.026
I am still a little drunk,

13:54.027 --> 13:55.728
and I forget what was in my speech,

13:55.729 --> 13:58.231
and I look like a very
pretty Burt Reynolds

13:58.232 --> 14:00.233
and this is all your fault!

14:00.234 --> 14:02.767
Is the implication here
that Burt Reynolds isn't pretty?

14:04.270 --> 14:05.771
Yes, it is my fault for forcing you

14:05.772 --> 14:07.206
to have the time of your life

14:07.207 --> 14:08.507
and make out with those dudes.

14:08.508 --> 14:09.675
Max, you don't even...

14:09.676 --> 14:10.676
dudes?

14:10.677 --> 14:11.811
Plural?

14:11.812 --> 14:13.145
How many dudes?

14:13.146 --> 14:15.381
I lost count after the third Chet.

14:15.382 --> 14:17.917
I can't believe you did this to me.

14:17.918 --> 14:20.286
It was more like you doing it to them.

14:20.287 --> 14:23.289
Max, I am serious right now.
(exhales sharply)

14:23.290 --> 14:25.191
Calm down, Luigi.

14:25.192 --> 14:27.793
(exhales) Max, I know you were mad

14:27.794 --> 14:30.696
about the <i>Time Out</i> interview
and the "partner" thing,

14:30.697 --> 14:33.065
but I can't believe you
sabotaged me on purpose.

14:33.066 --> 14:35.268
Okay, first of all,

14:35.269 --> 14:36.802
I don't think about you that much.

14:36.803 --> 14:38.804
I am sorry I didn't give you credit,

14:38.805 --> 14:41.540
but ruining this for
me is so much worse.

14:41.541 --> 14:43.075
This was gonna be my comeback.

14:43.076 --> 14:44.510
I wasn't mad.

14:44.511 --> 14:46.014
You were the only one upset about it.

14:46.015 --> 14:47.580
I don't care about that stuff.

14:47.581 --> 14:49.615
Honestly, I just wanted
you to have a good time.

14:49.616 --> 14:51.884
I didn't need to have a good time.

14:51.885 --> 14:53.753
I needed to make people jealous.

14:53.754 --> 14:55.354
Who's gonna be jealous of me now?

14:55.355 --> 14:57.723
Guys that can't grow facial hair?

14:57.724 --> 15:00.493
Look, you were great at school

15:00.494 --> 15:03.229
and last night you were great
at having fun at school.

15:03.230 --> 15:04.597
You're lucky. I have last night,

15:04.598 --> 15:06.098
but I'll never get to have both.

15:06.099 --> 15:08.467
What're you talking about?

15:08.468 --> 15:09.969
You're the smart one.

15:09.970 --> 15:11.537
You deserve your moment of triumph,

15:11.538 --> 15:13.639
but you also deserve
not to be Buzzkill Channing

15:13.640 --> 15:15.074
for the rest of your life.

15:15.075 --> 15:17.944
You really weren't mad
about the interview?

15:17.945 --> 15:19.278
A little,

15:19.279 --> 15:20.979
but I'm always a little mad at you.

15:22.548 --> 15:23.916
I'm sorry if I screwed things up.

15:23.917 --> 15:25.885
You don't have to be.

15:25.886 --> 15:28.721
I really did have fun, Max.

15:28.722 --> 15:31.356
See if you like the googly-eyes
I drew around your nipples.

15:33.159 --> 15:35.226
Fun how they go in
different directions.

15:39.999 --> 15:41.334
Sorry we're late.

15:41.335 --> 15:42.935
I had to scrub the
googly-eyes off my...

15:42.936 --> 15:45.171
bicycle traffic.

15:45.172 --> 15:46.672
Well, let's get started.

15:46.673 --> 15:48.674
I'm supposed to have lunch
with my son, Steve.

15:48.675 --> 15:51.058
We had a little fight last night
before he left for a party.

15:51.059 --> 15:53.199
If anything ever happened
to him, I'd be devastated.

15:54.513 --> 15:56.247
Praying for a different Steve.

15:58.217 --> 16:00.753
Wow, you made out with half
the people in this room.

16:00.754 --> 16:02.854
I'm pretty sure you got
one of the Chets pregnant.

16:04.490 --> 16:07.660
Caroline Channing is
an alumni of Wharton,

16:07.661 --> 16:09.662
and also the brains behind

16:09.663 --> 16:11.731
a thriving new dessert bar in Brooklyn,

16:11.732 --> 16:14.867
and she is here to tell
us how she did it.

16:14.868 --> 16:16.651
Oh, also, um, whoever
keeps writing "wash me"

16:16.652 --> 16:19.872
in the back of my car,
there's no R in wash.

16:19.873 --> 16:22.074
Caroline.

16:22.075 --> 16:25.044
It is a great honor to be here today.

16:25.045 --> 16:27.713
I learned a lot
at this fine institution.

16:27.714 --> 16:30.049
Hard work, integrity,

16:30.050 --> 16:33.219
a lot of math I'll never use.

16:33.220 --> 16:35.154
There are a lot of smart people here,

16:35.155 --> 16:37.056
but the smartest person I know,

16:37.057 --> 16:38.991
I met waiting tables in a diner.

16:38.992 --> 16:40.091
Max, turn around.

16:42.728 --> 16:44.162
The other way.

16:47.233 --> 16:50.069
And I am proud to call her my partner.

16:50.070 --> 16:52.238
(coughs) Gay.

16:52.239 --> 16:54.507
This woman is the
reason I'm here today.

16:54.508 --> 16:57.243
She should be giving the speech
because she's how I did it.

16:57.244 --> 16:59.845
Her name is Max Black.

16:59.846 --> 17:01.680
(light applause)

17:01.681 --> 17:03.883
Um, what're you doing? You're leaving?

17:03.884 --> 17:05.951
They're jealous enough,

17:05.952 --> 17:07.653
and I want you to have your moment.

17:07.654 --> 17:10.021
You should get to have both too.

17:10.022 --> 17:11.603
And also, chug-chug has to puke-puke.

17:13.425 --> 17:15.993
And, uh, all right...

17:17.930 --> 17:19.732
I didn't go to college,

17:19.733 --> 17:21.867
but after spending some time here,

17:21.867 --> 17:24.769
I think I could teach you a few things.

17:26.372 --> 17:28.207
Beer...

17:28.208 --> 17:30.476
before liquor,

17:30.477 --> 17:31.476
never sicker.

17:33.079 --> 17:35.748
Liquor before beer,

17:35.749 --> 17:37.348
never fear.

17:38.784 --> 17:41.486
And weed before and after everything.

17:42.655 --> 17:45.791
Also, pimps up, hos down.

17:45.792 --> 17:47.393
Never...

17:47.394 --> 17:49.795
get high on your own supply,

17:49.796 --> 17:51.564
and, most importantly,

17:51.565 --> 17:52.798
shake ya ass,

17:52.799 --> 17:55.134
but watch yourself.

17:55.135 --> 17:57.355
You should be taking notes.
This'll be on the midterm.

18:01.640 --> 18:03.809
Well, like most people
straight out of college,

18:03.810 --> 18:05.845
I'm at a job I don't wanna be at.

18:05.846 --> 18:07.480
That's right.

18:07.481 --> 18:11.250
She went back and got her
degree in "Make-out Slut."

18:11.251 --> 18:13.119
And we may have killed a guy.

18:13.120 --> 18:14.887
I may have too.

18:14.888 --> 18:16.521
I drove here without my glasses.

18:18.557 --> 18:21.794
You know, in Poland,
girls don't go to college.

18:21.795 --> 18:23.662
They drop them in a lake,

18:23.663 --> 18:27.299
and whoever doesn't drown is a witch.

18:27.300 --> 18:30.536
Doesn't that make you a witch, Sophie?

18:30.537 --> 18:32.670
No comment.

18:34.940 --> 18:37.175
If it isn't Magic No-Johnson.

18:38.644 --> 18:41.113
Pick a card,
and don't show me what it is.

18:41.114 --> 18:44.450
Don't worry, I'll hold it
well above four feet.

18:44.451 --> 18:46.718
Whatever puts the card
in your hands, toots.

18:48.521 --> 18:51.190
Was this your card?

18:51.191 --> 18:53.325
Nope, it was the Queen of Hearts.

18:53.326 --> 18:55.661
Oh, my God,

18:55.662 --> 18:58.296
Han's a witch too!

18:59.698 --> 19:00.698
Drown him!

19:03.202 --> 19:04.436
I did it.

19:04.437 --> 19:07.273
What hell have I unleashed?

19:07.274 --> 19:09.907
Whatever it is,
keep it in your training pants.

19:11.377 --> 19:13.200
I should have just
done traffic school online,

19:13.201 --> 19:14.834
but, no, Han wanted to meet people.

19:16.315 --> 19:18.050
Sophie,

19:18.051 --> 19:21.187
I think I found the solution
to all our problems.

19:21.188 --> 19:22.488
(gasps)

19:22.489 --> 19:24.455
Microwave in the headboard?

19:25.624 --> 19:27.426
I've told you repeatedly,

19:27.427 --> 19:29.427
the science just isn't there yet.

19:30.529 --> 19:32.031
Make sure I get an email

19:32.032 --> 19:34.567
when it is there.

19:34.568 --> 19:36.302
This is about us

19:36.303 --> 19:37.903
and Barbara.

19:37.904 --> 19:40.039
I want to be more involved.

19:40.040 --> 19:42.607
That's why I got these.

19:47.546 --> 19:48.746
Moobs...

19:50.349 --> 19:53.352
To feed Barbara with.

19:53.353 --> 19:55.687
Great, now I'm jealous of Oleg's rack.

19:57.189 --> 20:00.426
If he puts Dr. Pepper in there,
so am I.

20:00.427 --> 20:01.860
Oleg,

20:01.861 --> 20:04.262
tell me you kept your ding-dong.

20:05.664 --> 20:07.199
Oh, yeah.

20:07.200 --> 20:10.236
I'm just Mrs. Doubtfiring
it for the time being.

20:10.237 --> 20:13.271
We've gotta get that
kid out of that house.

20:14.873 --> 20:16.709
Well, you know what, Barbara?

20:16.710 --> 20:20.446
You're really lucky to
have such a good father.

20:20.447 --> 20:24.049
I guess I have been
bogarting baby Barbara.

20:24.050 --> 20:27.286
Yeah, it really is sweet
that you did that, Oleg.

20:27.287 --> 20:28.686
My eyes are up here, Caroline.

20:32.458 --> 20:34.992
We're out of milk in the kitchen.

20:45.938 --> 20:49.008
I really hope Earl milking Oleg

20:49.009 --> 20:50.109
is our rock bottom.

20:50.110 --> 20:52.176
It won't be.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.013
(cash register bell dings)
