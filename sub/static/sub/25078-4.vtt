00:44.400 --> 00:48.778
This is our planet's final frontier,

00:51.030 --> 00:57.076
an inner world where only
the most adventurous dare to go.

01:50.076 --> 01:51.535
Beneath our feet

01:51.660 --> 01:56.789
are countless miles
of cave shafts and passages.

02:13.177 --> 02:15.679
The Cave of Swallows in Mexico,

02:15.804 --> 02:17.931
400 meters to the bottom,

02:18.056 --> 02:22.101
deep enough to engulf
the Empire State Building.

02:29.273 --> 02:32.776
This is the biggest
cave shaft in the world.

02:32.859 --> 02:35.653
Yet these depths were
first explored

02:35.736 --> 02:39.531
only two years before
man landed on the moon.

02:42.950 --> 02:48.413
Today caves remain
the least explored places on Earth.

02:48.621 --> 02:52.124
However, human beings
are seldom the first

02:52.249 --> 02:55.919
to reach these black, damp places.

03:00.380 --> 03:07.052
Here, live some of the strangest
and least-known animals on the planet.

03:40.370 --> 03:47.333
This galaxy of little lights is created
by thousands of living creatures.

03:51.754 --> 03:56.883
Any animal that lives in a cave
has to cope with complete blackness,

03:56.966 --> 04:02.512
but in New Zealand some have turned
this darkness to their advantage.

04:15.355 --> 04:19.317
A silicon strand is lowered
from the ceiling,

04:19.442 --> 04:22.236
alongside hundreds of others.

04:29.783 --> 04:32.077
Beautiful though these threads are,

04:32.243 --> 04:35.329
they have a sinister purpose.

04:36.830 --> 04:40.333
This is a cave glow worm.

04:40.583 --> 04:45.587
To trap its prey
it goes fishing with a line of silk.

04:52.467 --> 04:56.721
The silk comes from glands
in the glow worm's mouth

04:56.846 --> 05:00.140
and is loaded
with droplets of mucus.

05:14.568 --> 05:19.238
Each glow worm produces
dozens of these threads.

05:21.782 --> 05:23.700
Once its lines are set,

05:23.825 --> 05:26.952
the glow worm hangs
from a mucus hammock

05:27.077 --> 05:30.664
and waits, like a patient angler.

05:35.084 --> 05:38.253
But the glow worm doesn't leave
everything to chance.

05:38.461 --> 05:42.631
That ghostly blue light
is the result of a chemical reaction

05:42.756 --> 05:47.302
taking place inside
a special capsule in its tail.

05:48.135 --> 05:51.305
The light literally shines
out of its backside.

05:51.430 --> 05:54.766
It's a lure for attracting prey.

06:22.579 --> 06:27.082
Insects seem irresistibly drawn
towards the source

06:27.207 --> 06:31.127
and then get trapped
by the sticky lines.

06:40.384 --> 06:41.844
Once stuck,

06:41.969 --> 06:43.762
there is no escape.

06:49.266 --> 06:53.311
Now it's just a matter
of reeling in the line

06:53.603 --> 06:57.564
and slowly consuming
the catch - alive.

07:13.410 --> 07:16.496
By ensnaring the insects
that hatch in this cave,

07:16.621 --> 07:19.706
these glow worms have solved
the biggest challenge

07:19.832 --> 07:22.125
that permanent cave dwellers face -

07:22.250 --> 07:25.836
finding a regular
and reliable source of food.

07:33.300 --> 07:38.012
One kind of rock makes
this whole underground world possible -

07:38.137 --> 07:39.639
limestone.

07:40.014 --> 07:42.933
Most of the world's caves
are found within it

07:43.058 --> 07:46.769
and it covers nearly 10 percent
of the earth's surface.

07:53.024 --> 07:58.778
Limestone is composed of minerals
derived from marine shells and corals,

07:58.862 --> 08:02.323
so although this rocky escarpment
in the United States

08:02.406 --> 08:05.367
is now hundreds of meters
above sea level

08:05.492 --> 08:08.578
it was actually formed under water.

08:15.875 --> 08:19.586
The limestone towers
of Vietnam's Ha Long Bay

08:19.711 --> 08:22.672
are a reminder
of this link with the sea.

08:22.797 --> 08:27.384
Originally, this whole area would have
been one solid block of limestone,

08:27.467 --> 08:29.802
the base of a coral reef.

08:40.602 --> 08:47.942
In Borneo, rain has sculptured the limestone
into extremely sharp-sided pinnacles.

09:01.452 --> 09:04.746
But the dissolving power
of rainwater

09:04.830 --> 09:09.333
has other, much more dramatic
effects underground.

09:20.383 --> 09:25.679
Rivers that flow over limestone
often seem to completely disappear.

09:40.107 --> 09:43.526
When the water reaches
the more resistant bed of limestone

09:43.651 --> 09:45.945
its course is altered.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.783
Once underground,

09:51.908 --> 09:56.119
the water takes on
a new, more erosive power.

10:01.874 --> 10:04.209
During its journey
from the surface

10:04.334 --> 10:07.670
the water absorbed carbon dioxide
from the soil

10:07.753 --> 10:09.880
making it mildly acidic.

10:10.130 --> 10:14.509
And over millions of years
this acid eats away the limestone

10:14.634 --> 10:18.178
creating a maze
of caverns and passages

10:18.303 --> 10:20.972
that sometimes go on for miles.

11:01.212 --> 11:06.507
This is the biggest underground
river passage in the world,

11:06.591 --> 11:10.802
so big a jumbo jet
could fly through it.

11:10.927 --> 11:14.013
It's Deer Cave, in Borneo.

11:26.523 --> 11:28.649
The sheer size of Deer Cave

11:28.733 --> 11:33.028
allows some animals
to gather there in huge numbers.

11:40.575 --> 11:45.871
A staggering 3 million
wrinkle-lipped bats live here.

11:49.457 --> 11:52.376
The bats roost high
on the walls and ceilings

11:52.460 --> 11:54.962
where they're well protected
from the outside elements

11:55.045 --> 11:57.130
and safe from predators.

12:05.470 --> 12:07.179
And while they're up here

12:07.304 --> 12:10.891
the bats produce
something very important.

12:15.519 --> 12:21.023
This hundred meter high mound
is made entirely of bat droppings -

12:21.149 --> 12:22.274
guano.

12:45.125 --> 12:50.880
Its surface is covered
by a thick carpet of cockroaches,

12:51.172 --> 12:53.549
hundreds of thousands of them.

12:59.095 --> 13:05.349
Caves are one of the few habitats
on Earth not directly powered by sunlight.

13:05.475 --> 13:14.106
In the absence of plants this food chain
is based on a continuous supply of bat droppings.

13:26.366 --> 13:29.201
The cockroaches feed
on the guano

13:29.702 --> 13:32.370
and anything that falls into it.

13:59.975 --> 14:03.770
The droppings also support
other types of cockroaches

14:03.895 --> 14:07.773
which spend part of their day
resting on cave walls.

14:12.068 --> 14:16.822
These in turn become food
for giant cave centipedes,

14:16.905 --> 14:19.866
some more than 20 centimeters long.

14:23.618 --> 14:26.204
Bizarrely, there are crabs here, too,

14:26.287 --> 14:29.415
sifting through the droppings
for nutrients.

14:36.670 --> 14:40.882
All these animals spend their entire lives
within the cave.

14:40.965 --> 14:45.010
They're totally dependant
on the digested remains of food

14:45.093 --> 14:47.387
that's brought here from outside.

15:14.825 --> 15:17.494
Each evening in just two hours

15:17.619 --> 15:21.288
three million bats leave
the safety of the cave

15:21.413 --> 15:24.791
to hunt for insects
in the forest outside.

15:27.418 --> 15:30.003
But not all will return.

15:51.979 --> 15:53.563
As they leave the cave

15:53.688 --> 15:57.900
the stream of bats form
a doughnut-shaped ring.

16:01.111 --> 16:05.656
The wheeling bats seem
to confuse a rufus-bellied eagle,

16:05.781 --> 16:11.535
but they must still survive the attacks
of other, more specialized, birds of prey.

16:22.627 --> 16:28.549
Peregrine falcons and bat hawks
are the jetfighters of the bird world.

17:00.490 --> 17:03.326
Good hunting will end
as the light fades

17:03.451 --> 17:07.329
so the bat hawks bolt
their catches on the wing

17:08.621 --> 17:10.998
and fly straight back for more.

17:13.458 --> 17:15.710
Any bat separated from the group

17:15.835 --> 17:20.422
becomes a clear and obvious target
and is asking for trouble.

17:31.848 --> 17:36.059
Yet the nightly onslaught has
little impact on bat numbers -

17:36.184 --> 17:41.689
by the morning the vast majority
will be back in the safety of the cave.

17:51.696 --> 17:56.283
Bats are not the only commuters
in these Bornean caves.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.577
There's a day shift as well.

18:04.832 --> 18:07.167
Returning from hunting
in the sunlight

18:07.250 --> 18:09.794
these commuters rely
on their loud clicks

18:09.877 --> 18:14.381
to find their way through the cave
passages in total darkness.

18:20.719 --> 18:22.929
They're cave swiftlets.

18:23.304 --> 18:27.224
Like bats they use
echolocation to navigate.

18:27.349 --> 18:29.934
We need lights
to see what's going on,

18:30.018 --> 18:36.022
but in the pitch black the swiftlets manage
unerringly to locate their individual nesting sites,

18:36.148 --> 18:39.025
which are only
a few centimeters across.

18:43.945 --> 18:49.783
It's a remarkable skill
and one we still do not fully understand.

18:53.578 --> 18:56.580
These birds are unusual
for another reason.

18:56.705 --> 19:02.418
Their little cup-like nests
are made entirely from threads of saliva.

19:07.589 --> 19:11.175
It takes more than 30 days
to complete one.

19:12.426 --> 19:15.386
The nests are very precious objects,

19:15.423 --> 19:18.138
and not only for the birds.

19:36.111 --> 19:42.282
For 500 years people have been
harvesting the nests of cave swiftlets.

19:55.251 --> 19:57.836
It's a very risky business.

19:57.919 --> 20:00.213
With virtually no safety equipment

20:00.296 --> 20:03.340
and using ladders
made from forest vines

20:03.424 --> 20:06.926
the gatherers climb
into the highest reaches of the cave

20:07.010 --> 20:10.137
often more than 60 meters
from the floor.

20:19.269 --> 20:21.980
The work may be hazardous
in the extreme,

20:22.105 --> 20:24.565
but the rewards are great.

20:34.489 --> 20:37.241
The pure white nests
of cave swiftlets

20:37.367 --> 20:40.828
are the main ingredient
of birds' nest soup

20:40.953 --> 20:44.914
and gram for gram
are worth as much as silver.

20:47.041 --> 20:52.003
As soon as its nest is removed
a bird will immediately build another.

20:52.128 --> 20:56.340
So, as long as this valuable
harvest is properly controlled,

20:56.423 --> 20:59.342
the colonies will continue
to flourish.

21:11.977 --> 21:15.396
These Bornean caves are
among the biggest in the world

21:15.479 --> 21:16.939
and they're still getting bigger

21:17.022 --> 21:22.401
as each year rainwater
eats away a little more limestone.

21:33.118 --> 21:36.788
But water in caves
doesn't only erode.

21:36.913 --> 21:39.081
It also builds.

21:46.087 --> 21:49.881
This water is loaded
with dissolved limestone

21:50.006 --> 21:52.258
and when it meets
the air in the cave

21:52.383 --> 21:55.552
some of that is deposited
as a mineral -

21:55.761 --> 21:57.095
calcite.

21:59.472 --> 22:00.681
As it builds up

22:00.765 --> 22:05.018
so the calcite forms decorations
that hang from the ceiling -

22:05.101 --> 22:06.769
stalactites.

22:14.609 --> 22:18.987
Each drop leaves behind
only a miniscule amount of calcite,

22:19.112 --> 22:24.199
but over time the process
can produce some spectacular results.

22:55.182 --> 22:58.017
If the water seeps
though the ceiling quickly,

22:58.101 --> 23:01.562
then the calcite is deposited
on the floor of the cave

23:01.687 --> 23:04.689
and that creates stalagmites.

23:14.280 --> 23:17.574
Variations in water flow
and the air currents

23:17.657 --> 23:23.704
produce an infinite variety of forms,
but all are created by the same process -

23:24.037 --> 23:28.082
the slow deposition
of dissolved limestone.

23:31.543 --> 23:34.546
And when stalactite meets stalagmite

23:34.671 --> 23:36.964
a column is born.

24:01.108 --> 24:05.111
Structures like these
in North America's Carlsbad Cavern

24:05.194 --> 24:08.530
can take many thousands
of years to develop.

24:08.655 --> 24:13.909
But sometimes the formations
in a cave stop growing altogether.

24:42.390 --> 24:49.562
These flooded caves in Mexico have remained
virtually unchanged for thousands of years.

24:49.645 --> 24:54.399
Since the last Ice Age they've become
cut off from the outside world.

24:54.524 --> 24:59.361
Yet their impact on life
on the surface has been huge.

25:04.824 --> 25:10.745
500 years ago they supported
one of the world's great civilizations

25:10.870 --> 25:12.038
the Maya.

25:17.417 --> 25:22.963
Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula
has no rivers, lakes or streams

25:23.046 --> 25:29.968
so the Maya relied on the cenotes -
the flooded entrances to the water-filled caves.

25:33.054 --> 25:39.184
These flooded shafts are the region's
only source of open fresh water.

25:41.394 --> 25:47.107
The cenotes are, in effect,
gigantic fresh water wells.

26:12.293 --> 26:15.379
Away from the life-giving rays
of sunshine

26:15.629 --> 26:19.090
one might not expect
to find plants.

26:27.805 --> 26:30.390
But in the darkness
of the cave tunnels

26:30.474 --> 26:35.978
roots of giant tropical trees have pushed
their way through cracks in the limestone

26:36.061 --> 26:38.355
to reach the flooded caverns.

26:40.106 --> 26:41.440
Without this water

26:41.566 --> 26:45.902
the Yucatan's forest
could not grow so luxuriantly.

27:06.085 --> 27:10.046
The Maya knew that their lives
depended on this water,

27:10.129 --> 27:13.090
but it's only with the help
of today's technology

27:13.173 --> 27:20.179
that we've come to appreciate the full significance
and scale of these flooded passageways.

27:23.723 --> 27:31.104
So far, more than 350 miles of underwater galleries
in the Yucatan have been mapped,

27:31.229 --> 27:38.026
but still nobody yet knows the true extend
of this subterranean waterworld.

27:38.235 --> 27:40.486
And with good reason.

27:42.905 --> 27:47.242
Underwater caving
is notoriously dangerous.

27:47.325 --> 27:51.036
When the nearest exit may be
hundreds of meters or more away,

27:51.120 --> 27:54.872
running out of air
down here would be fatal.

27:58.459 --> 28:00.043
To avoid getting lost

28:00.126 --> 28:02.962
divers carry with them
a spool of string.

28:03.045 --> 28:04.964
It becomes their lifeline -

28:05.047 --> 28:06.089
literally.

28:20.184 --> 28:23.436
The string also doubles
as a measuring tape -

28:23.520 --> 28:26.439
a technique that has been
used here, in Mexico,

28:26.522 --> 28:30.066
to chart the largest
underwater cave in the world -

28:30.150 --> 28:32.860
all 100 miles of it.

28:41.117 --> 28:47.246
Cave exploration often requires you
to push yourself through narrow gaps in the rock.

28:47.497 --> 28:51.291
Cavers call such places 'squeezes. '

29:00.465 --> 29:02.008
The tighter the squeeze,

29:02.133 --> 29:07.345
the greater the chance of damaging
some vital life-support system.

29:33.741 --> 29:38.870
In these conditions a diver
could easily become disorientated

29:38.995 --> 29:41.080
and that could be fatal.

29:55.299 --> 30:00.386
The flooded caverns can play
tricks on you in other ways.

30:08.518 --> 30:10.144
What seems like air,

30:10.269 --> 30:11.478
isn't.

30:12.271 --> 30:15.315
It's just another kind of water.

30:22.987 --> 30:25.072
This is a halocline -

30:25.156 --> 30:28.575
a meeting of fresh and salt water.

30:31.244 --> 30:37.332
Fresh water from the jungle flows
over the heavier salt water from the sea.

30:38.374 --> 30:41.960
The saltwater layer
is extremely low in oxygen

30:42.044 --> 30:46.130
making it a particularly
difficult place for animals to live.

30:46.422 --> 30:48.465
Yet some have managed it,

30:48.632 --> 30:53.845
like the remiped,
one of the most ancient of all living crustaceans.

31:02.434 --> 31:06.354
The Maya understood
the importance of the cenotes,

31:06.479 --> 31:09.940
but they could never have known
that these flooded passageways

31:10.065 --> 31:13.818
were actually the beginning
of subterranean rivers,

31:14.152 --> 31:17.655
all of which eventually
flow out to the sea.

31:27.537 --> 31:32.041
Salt water, unlike fresh water,
does not erode limestone,

31:32.166 --> 31:38.129
so most sea caves are created
by the mechanical pounding of the waves.

31:44.676 --> 31:50.889
The rocky outcrops of New Zealand's
Poor Knight Islands are riddled with sea caves

31:50.972 --> 31:52.849
and just like those in Borneo

31:52.932 --> 31:56.601
they have become important shelters
for many species.

32:01.272 --> 32:03.982
After a day feeding
in the open water

32:04.066 --> 32:08.277
vast shoals of demoiselle fish
return to the caves,

32:08.361 --> 32:11.655
which they use
as a refuge from predators.

32:14.240 --> 32:18.118
For these fish the caves
are a night time retreat,

32:18.243 --> 32:21.204
but they're not
the only commuters in here.

32:21.287 --> 32:25.040
There are other fish
working to a different schedule.

32:32.463 --> 32:35.882
The big eyes are
the equivalent of bats.

32:36.007 --> 32:39.260
Night feeders leave
the cave each evening.

32:43.638 --> 32:46.223
And like all cave commuters

32:46.307 --> 32:50.643
they are most vulnerable
at the scheduled time of departure.

33:01.902 --> 33:08.032
A bottleneck funnels these exiting bats
into dense concentrations

33:08.115 --> 33:10.617
attracting the attention of others.

33:38.472 --> 33:42.767
The bats can detect the snakes
using echolocation,

33:43.017 --> 33:45.686
but the snakes are literally
in the dark -

33:45.769 --> 33:47.646
they can see nothing.

34:01.365 --> 34:05.118
The strikes seem
to be largely hit-and-miss,

34:07.036 --> 34:10.246
but the snakes have
a secret weapon.

34:10.621 --> 34:14.250
They can actually sense
each bat flying past.

34:14.375 --> 34:19.963
Receptors in the snake's head pick up
the heat given off by the flying bats,

34:20.213 --> 34:22.715
as this thermal image shows.

34:29.387 --> 34:33.181
To the snakes
the bats are apparently glowing

34:33.264 --> 34:36.225
and this gives them
something to aim at.

34:58.659 --> 35:02.746
This is the price
that these cave commuters must pay

35:02.871 --> 35:06.082
for their daytime sanctuary
on the ground.

35:06.290 --> 35:11.669
Small wonder then that there are
other cave dwellers that stay put.

35:19.259 --> 35:21.719
Many caves are like islands -

35:21.802 --> 35:26.264
cut off from the outside world
and from other caves.

35:34.229 --> 35:41.234
This isolation has resulted in the evolution
of some various strange creatures.

35:43.069 --> 35:45.863
They are the cave specialists -

35:45.946 --> 35:51.951
troglodytes, animals that never emerge
from the caves or see daylight.

36:04.877 --> 36:07.588
These troglodytes from Thailand

36:07.671 --> 36:11.466
are possibly the most specialized
creatures on Earth

36:11.591 --> 36:15.219
for they live only
in cave waterfalls.

36:16.053 --> 36:19.472
The entire population
of these cave angel fish

36:19.597 --> 36:23.975
seems to be restricted
to just two small caves.

36:27.937 --> 36:30.606
It's the same story
with other troglodytes.

36:30.689 --> 36:36.193
There may well be less than a hundred
Texas cave salamanders in the wild.

36:52.873 --> 36:56.876
And the Belizean white crab
is another creature

36:57.001 --> 37:00.629
that is unique
to just one cave system.

37:05.508 --> 37:07.634
Living in perpetual darkness

37:07.759 --> 37:10.887
they have all not only lost
the pigment in their skin,

37:11.054 --> 37:13.013
but also their eyes.

37:15.098 --> 37:18.935
It takes thousands of generations
for eyes to be lost,

37:19.018 --> 37:24.147
so these species must have been
isolated for a very long time.

37:29.026 --> 37:34.614
But the blind salamander has
other highly developed sensory organs.

37:37.199 --> 37:43.412
Receptors in their skin detect minute
movements in the water made by its prey.

37:49.875 --> 37:55.838
External gills help it to breathe
in water that is particularly low in oxygen.

38:07.597 --> 38:12.726
The cave angel fish feed on bacteria
in the fast flowing water

38:12.810 --> 38:17.313
keeping their grip
with microscopic hooks on their fins.

38:27.947 --> 38:30.490
Food is often in short supply

38:30.657 --> 38:32.992
and troglodytes like the crab

38:33.117 --> 38:37.204
have to survive on whatever washes
into the cave from outside.

38:41.666 --> 38:45.502
The salamander might not encounter
food for several months,

38:45.627 --> 38:47.587
so when something does come along

38:47.754 --> 38:49.755
it can't afford to miss it.

38:56.802 --> 39:03.224
It's astonishing that these extraordinary
cave dwellers manage to survive at all.

39:03.683 --> 39:06.226
But one cave is so inhospitable

39:06.351 --> 39:10.271
that one would not expect it
to contain any life whatsoever.

39:16.276 --> 39:20.404
The water flowing out
of the Villa Luz cave in Mexico

39:20.529 --> 39:24.615
is actually colored white
with sulphuric acid.

39:39.585 --> 39:42.504
Explorers entering this dangerous cave

39:42.629 --> 39:46.424
must wear respirators
and carry monitors.

39:46.507 --> 39:49.968
Poisonous gases rise
to fatal levels so quickly

39:50.094 --> 39:53.138
that an early warning system
is essential.

39:57.975 --> 40:01.769
Bats survive by staying
close to the skylights,

40:01.894 --> 40:06.731
but venturing deep into the cave
is very dangerous indeed.

40:16.239 --> 40:21.952
The source of these toxic fumes
lies several miles below.

40:22.160 --> 40:27.498
Hydrogen sulphide gas bubbles up
from oil deposits in the earth's crust.

40:27.623 --> 40:30.041
It mixes with oxygen and the water,

40:30.166 --> 40:32.835
and forms sulphuric acid.

40:44.177 --> 40:48.597
These are not the sort of conditions
in which you would expect to find fish,

40:48.722 --> 40:51.766
yet these cave mollies
seem to thrive

40:51.891 --> 40:55.353
despite the acid
and the low levels of oxygen.

40:57.980 --> 41:02.066
There is, in fact, more life here
than anyone would think possible,

41:02.191 --> 41:07.362
but the biggest surprise
is something altogether more bizarre.

41:17.620 --> 41:26.293
These strange stalactite-like formations
are known, rather appropriately, as snotites,

41:26.418 --> 41:30.838
the drops dripping
from the ends are sulphuric acid,

41:30.963 --> 41:33.465
strong enough to burn skin.

41:37.052 --> 41:41.305
The snotites are, in fact,
vast colonies of bacteria,

41:41.430 --> 41:44.891
capable of going a centimeter a day.

41:49.311 --> 41:51.354
In this world without sunlight

41:51.479 --> 41:56.733
these bacteria extract energy
from the hydrogen sulphide gas.

42:01.320 --> 42:05.365
Bacteria like these
are known as extremofile

42:05.490 --> 42:10.202
because of their ability to survive
in such extreme conditions.

42:12.662 --> 42:17.666
And these extremofiles play
another important role in this cave.

42:17.791 --> 42:21.419
Surprisingly, they are
the basis of a food chain

42:21.503 --> 42:26.298
which supports, amongst other creatures,
the larvae of these midges.

42:36.097 --> 42:39.808
Villa Luz's ecosystem
was certainly very remarkable,

42:39.975 --> 42:45.521
but cave explorers were soon to make
an even more astonishing discovery.

42:58.239 --> 43:03.660
Beneath this arid landscape
lies a subterranean wonderland.

43:09.665 --> 43:13.376
Without water one might not
expect to find any caves,

43:13.501 --> 43:17.880
but beneath these rolling
desert slopes in the United States

43:18.005 --> 43:24.969
lies one of the longest, deepest
and most surprising caves in the world.

43:28.930 --> 43:33.183
Its secrets remained unknown
until 1986,

43:33.308 --> 43:36.853
when cavers dug through
several meters of loose rock

43:36.936 --> 43:39.021
to the bottom of this pit.

43:42.482 --> 43:45.401
They named the cave 'Lechuguilla'

43:45.568 --> 43:52.865
and since this discovery more than
120 miles of passageways have been mapped.

43:58.036 --> 44:00.204
When the first explorers descended,

44:00.329 --> 44:03.790
no-one guessed
at the sheer size of this cave.

44:03.915 --> 44:08.002
But even that was not going
to be the biggest surprise.

44:08.169 --> 44:10.546
Little did they realize that Lechuguilla

44:10.671 --> 44:13.673
would soon be regarded
by cavers the world over

44:13.798 --> 44:17.426
as the most beautiful
of all caves.

44:17.718 --> 44:19.094
They were about to discover

44:19.219 --> 44:24.515
some of the most exquisite formations
ever seen underground.

44:38.817 --> 44:44.363
The walls were covered
with the most delicate and fragile crystals.

44:59.584 --> 45:02.919
Many of these crystals
were made of gypsum,

45:03.045 --> 45:05.672
a mineral that comes
from limestone.

45:05.963 --> 45:09.258
And there was mile after mile of them.

45:26.688 --> 45:30.107
Water is the creator
of most caves,

45:30.191 --> 45:32.984
but, unlike all other limestone caves,

45:33.110 --> 45:38.405
Lechuguilla's rock had not been
eaten away by running rainwater.

45:39.823 --> 45:42.283
Something else was responsible.

45:50.706 --> 45:57.629
The only water Lechuguilla has
are these wonderfully still clear pools.

46:02.466 --> 46:05.176
As the explorers went deeper
into the cave,

46:05.301 --> 46:10.222
they came across whole galleries
filled with the most unusual formations,

46:10.347 --> 46:15.893
like these 5-meter cones,
frosted with the most delicate crystals.

46:45.749 --> 46:48.585
It was Lechuguilla's gypsum crystals

46:48.710 --> 46:53.005
that made scientists question
how these caverns were formed.

46:55.340 --> 47:02.554
They discovered that Lechuguilla's limestone
had actually been eaten away by sulphuric acid,

47:02.679 --> 47:06.432
cutting through literally miles
of limestone.

47:24.029 --> 47:27.198
And when sulphuric acid dissolves limestone

47:27.323 --> 47:29.575
it leaves behind gypsum,

47:29.700 --> 47:33.495
the basis of Lechuguilla's
remarkable formations.

47:33.620 --> 47:35.121
And there was one set,

47:35.246 --> 47:37.664
more than a mile from the surface,

47:37.748 --> 47:40.375
that almost defied belief.

47:57.346 --> 48:01.808
The Chandelier Ballroom
was the ultimate discovery.

48:01.933 --> 48:04.393
With its six-meter long crystals

48:04.519 --> 48:10.273
it's surely the most bizarre
cave chamber in the world.

48:51.680 --> 48:56.642
And the walls had
one further surprise.

48:58.227 --> 49:04.482
Extremofile bacteria were found
to be feeding on the rock itself.

49:10.403 --> 49:15.991
The discovery of life that exists
without drawing any of its energy from the sun

49:16.116 --> 49:22.913
shows us once again how complex
and surprising the underground world can be.

49:26.624 --> 49:32.712
Each year explorers chart over
a hundred miles of new cave passages.

49:34.588 --> 49:38.675
But with half the world's
limestone still to be explored,

49:38.800 --> 49:44.805
who knows how many Lechuguillas
are still waiting to be discovered?
