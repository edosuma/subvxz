WEBVTT

00:00.959 --> 00:02.418
How are you feeling?
Scared.

00:03.253 --> 00:06.422
Donna has a high risk of
a life-threatening hemorrhage
in her third trimester.

00:06.965 --> 00:08.383
Our baby is gonna be okay.

00:09.843 --> 00:10.843
Come on, Jason.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.180
I tried everything
to save your boy.

00:14.264 --> 00:15.723
And I wish that
I could have saved him.

00:15.808 --> 00:16.849
You're dead.

00:16.934 --> 00:18.893
Lullo is the real deal.
You gotta stay
on your toes for a while.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.770
It's a lot of pressure,
working together.

00:21.438 --> 00:24.357
It's not the work part
that's tough.
It's the home part.

00:41.417 --> 00:42.542
Peter Mills?

00:42.960 --> 00:43.960
Yeah.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.963
Look, I just wanted to
come down here to say that

00:48.048 --> 00:49.632
I regret my behavior
the other day.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.887
And I've got nothing
but respect for you
and what everyone does here.

00:56.640 --> 00:57.724
I was upset.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.644
I know you tried to
save my son.

01:04.815 --> 01:06.190
Look, Mr. Lullo,
you should know that

01:07.943 --> 01:10.027
in the back of that ambulance,
your son was talking
about you.

01:11.572 --> 01:12.739
How important family was.

01:14.116 --> 01:15.199
He said that you were the best

01:16.410 --> 01:17.535
and he loved you.

01:18.829 --> 01:19.829
It struck a chord with me.

01:21.415 --> 01:24.917
My father died when
I was young and I know that
I felt the same way about him.

01:29.965 --> 01:31.132
Thank you.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.604
Hey, Lieutenant?

01:45.355 --> 01:46.731
Look, I just wanted you
to know

01:47.065 --> 01:48.941
I'm not trying to
insert myself in yours
and Gabby's business.

01:51.403 --> 01:52.487
Noted, Mills.

02:13.342 --> 02:15.009
Matt, listen, um,

02:16.303 --> 02:17.470
I need to apologize,

02:18.096 --> 02:19.931
so, I apologize.

02:21.225 --> 02:22.558
And, you know I got
this bad habit

02:22.684 --> 02:25.895
of letting words fall out
willy-nilly and I don't,

02:25.979 --> 02:27.814
I don't really remember
what I even said.

02:29.441 --> 02:32.443
Hey! Uh, sorry.
Chief wants a word with us.

02:40.410 --> 02:41.410
Just static.

02:41.870 --> 02:42.995
Hey, come on in.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.998
Hey, I just wanted to let
both of you know that, uh,

02:46.083 --> 02:48.751
Donna is in the red zone
as far as the baby's arrival.

02:49.503 --> 02:52.129
Hey, that's great, Chief.
Congrats!

02:52.798 --> 02:53.881
You guys have a name
for him yet?

02:54.591 --> 02:55.675
We are keeping that
under wraps.

02:56.134 --> 02:57.134
Of course.

02:57.928 --> 03:00.263
Just in case I gotta
get outta here in a hurry,

03:00.347 --> 03:01.597
I may not be able to bring

03:01.682 --> 03:03.099
a relief Fire Chief over here
fast enough.

03:03.642 --> 03:04.934
No problem,
we got you covered.

03:05.352 --> 03:06.853
Thank you.
You ready to be a dad?

03:08.272 --> 03:09.438
Nope. Not at all.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.942
Did you tell your father yet?
Yeah.

03:13.485 --> 03:16.404
He cried so hard I nearly sent
the Orlando Fire Department
over to check on him.

03:16.947 --> 03:18.489
He's happy.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.200
Truck 81, Squad three,
Ambulance 61.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.743
See you, Dad!
You, you get outta here!

03:22.953 --> 03:24.370
Come on!
What's wrong with you?

03:46.059 --> 03:47.810
That's the Carlisle home
and they haven't come out!

03:48.228 --> 03:49.270
Any children?

03:50.314 --> 03:52.106
We'll take the bottom floor.
Otis...

03:52.941 --> 03:54.317
Watch out!

03:55.819 --> 03:56.944
Help!

03:57.487 --> 03:58.487
Mouch, swing the ladder!

03:58.822 --> 03:59.780
Copy that!

03:59.865 --> 04:01.032
Get me down from here!

04:04.286 --> 04:05.286
There you go.

04:40.489 --> 04:41.656
Damn it!

04:43.408 --> 04:44.408
Who else is inside?

04:44.910 --> 04:47.244
My wife.
She was in the bathroom!

04:48.038 --> 04:49.538
Severide.
Yeah!

04:50.290 --> 04:51.540
Look, the wife is still
in the bathroom.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.625
Got it.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.133
We have to find the bathroom.
Copy that!

05:06.056 --> 05:07.765
Fire Department!
Call out!

05:13.897 --> 05:15.648
Call out! Fire Department.

05:16.775 --> 05:17.775
I don't see her!

05:18.110 --> 05:19.986
Severide! This is too much!

05:20.070 --> 05:21.237
We gotta pull out!

05:21.738 --> 05:23.614
Yeah! Okay.

05:26.243 --> 05:27.243
All right.

05:49.975 --> 05:51.100
Help!

05:55.105 --> 05:58.566
Capp, I got her! I see her.
Let's go!

06:07.868 --> 06:09.160
Ready? Go!

06:20.630 --> 06:21.881
You believe this clown?

06:22.591 --> 06:26.552
Last winter, we have a guy
literally lay across
his entire family to save 'em

06:26.636 --> 06:28.637
and he can't get out
that window fast enough.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.529
Oh, God. Is she breathing?

06:47.532 --> 06:48.532
I'll get a line in.

06:48.825 --> 06:49.909
I'll get the airway.

06:51.328 --> 06:52.328
All right.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.413
Hey, you can meet us
at Chicago Med.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.002
Hey! Nice save.

07:02.047 --> 07:04.048
I'd like to throw the husband
back through the window.

07:25.362 --> 07:27.113
Hey, Chaplain Orlovsky!

07:27.656 --> 07:28.989
Great to see you, Padre.

07:30.033 --> 07:31.784
Yeah. Give me
your boot there, Christopher.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.619
Why?
Give me your boot.

07:35.539 --> 07:36.705
All right.

07:37.582 --> 07:40.543
I want this boot filled
by the end of the week.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.088
It's always something,
come on.
Listen up, listen up.

07:44.548 --> 07:46.215
The Good Shepherd Soup Kitchen
that I run

07:46.883 --> 07:48.843
has an oven that doesn't
get above 100 degrees,

07:49.719 --> 07:51.804
has a kitchen that
the city's gonna condemn.

07:52.597 --> 07:55.891
Now, that means a lot of
cold, homeless Chicagoans

07:55.976 --> 07:57.268
are gonna get turned away
during the holidays.

07:57.853 --> 07:59.520
I can't have that!

07:59.604 --> 08:00.771
We'll fill it up, Chaplain.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.732
I'll come collect
after next shift.

08:04.276 --> 08:05.401
Don't let me down!

08:06.194 --> 08:10.823
You, you, you. Yeah.
You and you.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.408
Don't let him down.

08:16.872 --> 08:18.372
Hey, there she is.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.792
Chaplain, hey.
Good to see you.
Mmm.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.672
Hey, can I tell you
the hardest thing
about my job?

08:26.756 --> 08:27.756
What's that?

08:28.508 --> 08:29.675
People come to my office

08:29.759 --> 08:31.093
when they're in
a deepest valley,

08:31.887 --> 08:34.263
but they stop comin' once
they've climbed out of it.

08:35.223 --> 08:37.516
Yeah, I'm sorry, I've been
meaning to come by and say hi.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.311
Well, don't give it
a second thought.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.106
Hey, I'm hearing great things
about you as a firefighter.

08:44.274 --> 08:46.442
Oh. That's nice.

08:47.277 --> 08:48.277
Everything else good?

08:49.988 --> 08:51.906
One day at a time.

08:53.867 --> 08:57.369
Well, keep it up.
You make me so proud.

08:58.455 --> 08:59.455
Thanks, Chaplain.

09:07.464 --> 09:08.964
Don't be crying
poor on me, Capp.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.008
I know what your side job
pulls in. Come on.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.468
You don't even know what
my side job is.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.553
Sure I do. You're a, you...

09:15.347 --> 09:16.347
Just throw a 20 in.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.392
Cheap.

09:20.518 --> 09:21.727
Come on, Cruz. Pony up.

09:21.853 --> 09:23.646
Every extra dollar I've got
is in Molly's truck.

09:23.730 --> 09:24.939
Me too. Don't even ask.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.023
Hey, Mouch,
turn it up.

09:27.192 --> 09:28.359
Severide, check it out.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.486
I saw she was down
and something inside me
was screaming out,

09:30.612 --> 09:32.446
"Do something, do something,"
you know?

09:33.073 --> 09:34.490
So I picked up
the heaviest thing
I could find

09:34.574 --> 09:38.160
and I threw it through
the window and I yelled out,
"Over here, over here!"

09:38.787 --> 09:41.121
The fire was out of control
at that point
and all I could think of was,

09:41.206 --> 09:42.498
"I have to help my wife."

09:43.166 --> 09:44.708
The smoke was so thick
I was choking on it

09:44.834 --> 09:47.795
Oh, God.
and anyway I was thrilled I could help alert those guys

09:47.879 --> 09:49.046
to save my wife in time.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.507
And this was
the scene earlier,

09:51.633 --> 09:53.217
where the Chicago
Fire Department
arrived just in time

09:53.343 --> 09:55.970
to save Veronica Carlisle,
but not quickly enough
to save the house.

09:56.513 --> 09:57.596
Compelling story, Glenn.

09:57.847 --> 10:00.099
Glad there're still
some local heroes
this time of year.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.101
In other news,
a new study shows...

10:02.310 --> 10:03.644
Compelling story, Glenn.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.021
Sir, could you, uh,
tell us exactly what happened?

10:06.648 --> 10:07.731
Oh, uh, of course, Dwight.

10:07.857 --> 10:10.317
Uh, well, um, my house was on
fire and I nearly wet myself.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.695
So I barreled out of a window
nearly killing a fireman

10:13.238 --> 10:14.697
while leaving
my poor wife to die.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.198
Oh.

10:16.992 --> 10:19.159
We should call the station and
tell our side of the story.

10:19.703 --> 10:21.203
Who cares?
Let the guy say
what he wants.

10:24.708 --> 10:25.916
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Whoo.

10:26.543 --> 10:27.835
Oh, no, no, no,
everything's fine.

10:29.004 --> 10:30.546
Just stopping by
on my way to the Grogans.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.048
Okay, can I get you something?

10:33.258 --> 10:34.800
Uh, a wheelbarrow.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.137
I got one of those. Come on.

10:38.763 --> 10:41.307
Would you like some lunch?
I've no idea what
those guys are making.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.017
Hmm. No, come here.

10:45.520 --> 10:48.731
Melissa's got 10 ladies
coming over to look at
jewelry or something.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.859
Don't worry, I'm only looking.

10:54.738 --> 10:57.156
Hey, you remember meeting her?
Melissa?

10:58.116 --> 11:00.200
They had a daughter,
Samantha, last year.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.120
And when it came time
to name her,

11:04.247 --> 11:05.664
they hyphenated her surname

11:06.166 --> 11:08.375
so it's Samantha Nash-McGuire.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.253
I was thinking that
maybe we could do that.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.966
Terrance Robbins-Boden.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.304
Uh, no.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.267
No? Just like that?
Yeah, just like that.

11:26.561 --> 11:30.064
Well, maybe you should take
longer than one second
to think about it.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.607
Donna,

11:32.108 --> 11:34.193
there is no way that
our child's going to have
two last names.

11:35.612 --> 11:36.904
End of story. Come on.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.239
Look, I love you,

11:41.117 --> 11:42.618
but Bodens have
just been Bodens.

11:44.329 --> 11:45.621
Tradition still
means something.

11:49.584 --> 11:50.584
Okay, well.

11:51.169 --> 11:52.961
What?
I'm gonna be on my way.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.589
No, Donna. Donna.
Hmm. No, no.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.634
I'll see you after shift.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.064
Great news, Herrmann.

12:12.148 --> 12:16.068
Hear ye, hear ye.
I present to you the debut
of Molly's Two.

12:17.570 --> 12:18.821
I don't understand.

12:19.322 --> 12:22.241
It was jammed last year
and there's gonna be
news coverage to boot.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.868
Newhouse got the permits
cleared and all we have to do

12:24.953 --> 12:27.079
is sell Chief Hale's
energy water out of the van.

12:28.832 --> 12:29.915
You guys are messing with me.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.917
No, no, no, Hermie-Herm.
Not at all.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.211
Molly's Two is finally
in business.

12:34.546 --> 12:35.796
It's everything
we dreamed about.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.507
Serving great food while
being a giant billboard
for your bar.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.386
Did Hale say anything about
my lieutenant-ship?

12:46.141 --> 12:47.724
Right, right, right.
Forget about it.

12:47.809 --> 12:50.894
No, this is great.
This is, I'm really proud
of you boys.

12:51.521 --> 12:53.021
I am. Yeah.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.113
Come on in, you two.

13:01.197 --> 13:04.491
Chief, I wanted to tell you
that Anthony Lullo was waiting
for me outside this morning.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.369
He apologized for his actions
the other day.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.746
He says he knows that
we did all that we could.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.416
And you believe him?

13:13.042 --> 13:16.336
I do. And looking back,
I'm glad that I didn't file
a police report on him.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.549
He's in deep grief and
he deserves a pass on this.

13:25.013 --> 13:27.389
Great. Glad you trusted
your gut.

13:28.933 --> 13:29.933
Me too, Chief.

13:35.732 --> 13:36.732
Matt, can we talk?

13:40.987 --> 13:44.156
Hey, you know I didn't mean
what I said last night.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.533
So now you remember?

13:47.619 --> 13:49.453
It was just stupid bar talk,
that's all.

13:50.288 --> 13:52.623
"The tough part isn't
the work part,
it's the home part."

13:53.082 --> 13:54.583
That's what you said, right?

13:56.336 --> 13:57.920
Doesn't sound like
stupid bar talk to me.

13:58.379 --> 14:00.172
I mean, sounds like
you knew exactly
what you were saying.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.882
Okay, I was frustrated,
I admit.

14:01.966 --> 14:03.759
You bust my chops at work,
we both bring it home

14:03.843 --> 14:05.594
and it affects us in ways
that aren't exactly healthy.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.222
You're the one who signed up
for this.

14:08.556 --> 14:09.556
Working for your fiance.

14:09.933 --> 14:11.099
We both did!

14:11.226 --> 14:12.809
Yeah, because I thought
you could handle it.
Me?

14:13.019 --> 14:15.979
I'm not the one crawling back
to my old flame to complain
about my future spouse!

14:16.397 --> 14:17.898
I didn't crawl back
to anything!

14:18.066 --> 14:20.108
I watched it happen.
I heard what I heard!

14:20.944 --> 14:24.613
You two! Maybe you should take
this conversation elsewhere.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.741
Yeah, I'm done talking.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.251
What is this, $50?

14:37.710 --> 14:38.710
This is pathetic.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.421
Okay. Out of the way,
out of the way.

14:43.007 --> 14:44.007
What's this?

14:44.300 --> 14:46.426
Sylvie and I have been
trying something
for the Holiday Fest.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.011
We call it "Santa Bites."

14:48.763 --> 14:49.972
Wait, we do?
Mmm-hmm.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.390
Santa Bites!

14:56.688 --> 14:59.147
Oh, okay. Wow!

14:59.983 --> 15:02.442
It's turkey, potatoes
and cranberries, all baked
into a bun.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.611
Mmm.

15:05.822 --> 15:06.822
Oh, oh, oh!

15:08.074 --> 15:09.658
Is it a double overhead shaka?

15:10.159 --> 15:11.910
Twice in one year?
Yeah!

15:12.996 --> 15:16.331
Damn, I hate to say it
but this food truck thing is
just what Molly's needs.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.334
Holy smokes! Mmm.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.258
For the last time,
edges first.

15:26.342 --> 15:27.342
Too easy.

15:28.595 --> 15:29.595
Well, will you look at this.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.140
Is that the husband?
Yeah.

15:33.933 --> 15:34.933
Can I help you?

15:35.226 --> 15:36.226
Uh, I think so.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.062
I was told
you're the firefighters
who rescued me and my wife?

15:40.690 --> 15:41.815
Yeah, we were there.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.108
Yeah.

15:43.234 --> 15:44.234
Well, I just wanted to
say thank you.

15:45.486 --> 15:46.570
I don't know
if you saw the news,

15:46.738 --> 15:48.113
but they're telling people
I was some sort of hero.

15:48.197 --> 15:51.158
Which I know is
the exact opposite of
what I am.

15:52.577 --> 15:55.203
Uh, okay.

15:55.747 --> 15:58.165
I'm Fred Carlisle.
My wife's Veronica.

15:59.167 --> 16:01.126
She's still in ICU,
but the doctors tell me
there's hope.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.173
Well, again, thank you.

16:11.429 --> 16:12.721
I see the way you guys
are looking at me.

16:13.723 --> 16:14.806
I know what
you must be thinking.

16:15.892 --> 16:16.892
So I want you guys to know.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.233
When I was 16,
I was in the garage
with my old man

16:25.401 --> 16:27.152
and this kiln we had
in there exploded.

16:28.863 --> 16:30.280
All I remember is
waking up in the burn unit.

16:31.199 --> 16:32.574
I spent the next eight months
in the ICU.

16:34.202 --> 16:35.702
So when that fire
broke out this morning,

16:38.039 --> 16:39.081
I panicked.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.416
I just, I panicked.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.418
Hey, man, you don't have
to explain yourself to us.

16:43.503 --> 16:44.503
I know. But I felt...

16:46.756 --> 16:48.548
I felt,
I don't know what I felt.

16:51.386 --> 16:52.594
Thanks for hearing me out.

16:53.388 --> 16:54.554
Yeah, no worries.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.015
And we're all pulling
for your wife.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.190
Walk a mile, men.
Walk a mile.

17:14.450 --> 17:15.492
Are you done with the washer?

17:16.786 --> 17:17.786
What? Oh, yeah.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.623
Is there some kind of
sign-in sheet for
when we can use these?

17:22.542 --> 17:25.544
Uh, no. It's more of
a first come, first serve.

17:27.839 --> 17:28.839
You okay?

17:31.634 --> 17:33.260
There's not a lot of estrogen
in this house,

17:33.428 --> 17:35.887
so if you ever wanna download,
I'm here.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.473
Thanks.

17:41.519 --> 17:44.563
I found this shirt
at the bottom of my locker.
It's, um,

17:44.814 --> 17:46.440
it's from this barbeque
a couple of years ago.

17:47.275 --> 17:50.777
When I was a paramedic,
and Casey was engaged to
this doctor and...

17:52.321 --> 17:55.824
I remember him playing
with a couple of these kids
in the park, and...

17:59.162 --> 18:04.833
I don't know. I don't know.
I, I guess it's just
things seemed simpler.

18:06.127 --> 18:07.169
Simpler?

18:08.504 --> 18:11.256
The man you loved was engaged
to another woman.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.302
Yeah.

18:17.680 --> 18:20.390
You're gonna look back
a year from now

18:20.516 --> 18:22.642
and be on the other side of
whatever's going on,
I know that.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.108
Here.

18:30.818 --> 18:31.818
What's this?

18:32.445 --> 18:34.112
Put it in the bottom
of your locker and then,

18:34.697 --> 18:37.157
a year from now,
when you find it,
you can remember this day.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.000
Sev.

18:48.586 --> 18:49.586
Plans after shift?

18:50.046 --> 18:51.171
Uh, home, rest.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.881
Nope. You and me,

18:53.424 --> 18:55.091
good old fashioned
Chicago bar crawl.

18:55.635 --> 18:58.887
I can't do that man.
I'm, I'm barely dried out
from the last month or so.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.599
Fine. One drink.
And we'll head home.
Come on.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.434
I'm serious.
One drink?

19:05.311 --> 19:06.394
It's all I'm asking.

19:07.104 --> 19:08.355
Go Hawks!

19:09.023 --> 19:12.776
Bartender, hey, uh, shots
for any girls above a nine,
all right?

19:14.612 --> 19:15.821
That's so wrong.

19:16.197 --> 19:17.197
Sexist.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.990
What are you talking...
All right, hey, uh, Tim.

19:19.951 --> 19:22.035
Equality for all, all right?
Six and up.

19:22.745 --> 19:23.787
Six and up.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.205
That's better.
All right.

19:25.289 --> 19:26.373
Yeah.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.084
So, what's up, dude?
Talk to me.

19:29.418 --> 19:32.587
Ah, change of pace is all.

19:32.922 --> 19:35.340
Couldn't do another night
at home talking about
my feelings.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.425
Well, how's everything
on that front?

19:38.719 --> 19:42.222
If I wanted to talk
about my feelings,
I wouldn't be at a bar.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.431
I get it, I get it.

19:43.558 --> 19:45.141
I don't, I don't blame you,
all right.

19:46.269 --> 19:47.811
Hey, whoa, hey,
not so fast.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.230
Where are you going so fast?
What are your names?

19:50.773 --> 19:52.107
Chloe.
Huh?

19:52.191 --> 19:53.441
Chloe.
Oh.

19:53.609 --> 19:54.609
This is Yuma.
Hi.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.778
Yuma! Like the movie.
I love that movie.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.905
Like the city.
Like the city.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.074
Okay, well...
Thank you.

20:01.450 --> 20:02.909
You two, we're doing shots.

20:03.494 --> 20:05.787
Okay, you're staying,
we're doing shots. On me.

20:06.289 --> 20:07.622
Apparently you made the cut.

20:15.172 --> 20:16.631
Yes!

20:17.508 --> 20:18.633
Cheers.

20:20.636 --> 20:21.636
Yeah!

20:39.155 --> 20:40.739
Well, good morning.

21:04.013 --> 21:08.350
I was proud when all
five of these kids
were born, but today...

21:09.602 --> 21:10.602
Today what, Christopher?

21:11.062 --> 21:14.356
Uh, today is somewhere
after all those days, honey.

21:14.607 --> 21:17.192
Hey, buddy.
Ten minutes till serving.
All right!

21:20.863 --> 21:21.988
Sorry!

21:29.997 --> 21:30.997
Hey.

21:33.834 --> 21:34.834
Only one drink, huh?

21:35.378 --> 21:38.880
One thing led to another,
and ended up being
an all-night thing.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.424
I tried texting you,
like, 50 times.

21:41.842 --> 21:43.551
I lost my phone along
the way somewhere.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.387
Listen, I'm, I'm sorry.

21:46.597 --> 21:47.597
I was a jerk.

21:48.224 --> 21:50.475
It only took eight shots
for me to figure that out.

21:53.646 --> 21:56.189
We can do this.
You and me.

21:57.400 --> 22:00.652
You and me.
We'll work it out.

22:04.031 --> 22:06.408
My God! You smell so horrible.
I'm sorry.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.536
Hey, so this is it, huh?

22:09.704 --> 22:11.371
Oh, yeah, this is it,
Lieutenant.

22:12.581 --> 22:13.581
Oh, hey!

22:14.166 --> 22:15.625
It's Melissa Brosh-McKenna.

22:16.252 --> 22:18.211
Oh, News Four.
Yeah.

22:18.629 --> 22:23.258
I'm a big fan of yours.
I love your news, uh,
it's the only news we watch.

22:24.051 --> 22:25.510
He is a big fan of yours.

22:25.594 --> 22:27.762
Oh, thanks. So sweet.

22:27.930 --> 22:28.972
Hey!

22:29.056 --> 22:32.058
This is the debut
of Molly's Two,
our new food truck.

22:32.143 --> 22:34.436
Maybe you guys could
put it in, uh, you know,
in a shot.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.147
Um, why not? Come on.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.859
Let's go. All right,
come on, Charles, let's go.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.277
Guys!

22:42.445 --> 22:43.820
Come on! This will be fun,
all right? Here we go.

22:43.946 --> 22:45.697
We're gonna go in,
three, two, one.

22:46.449 --> 22:49.242
We're down at
the 42nd annual
Chicago Holiday Festival,

22:49.493 --> 22:51.911
where families have gathered
for good cheer
and good eating.

22:52.455 --> 22:53.621
Sir, can you tell me
your name?

22:53.956 --> 22:55.498
Uh, Herrmann.
Christopher Herrmann.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.667
And you're saying this is
the debut of your food truck?

22:58.002 --> 23:01.504
Uh, yeah.
That's right.

23:01.630 --> 23:05.133
That's something we've been
working on, and working on,
like, three months, uh,

23:05.217 --> 23:06.676
because, you know, we wanted
to get it perfect.

23:07.136 --> 23:10.638
Our, our bar, Molly's,
has gone mobile.

23:11.015 --> 23:13.725
And that's Molly's with,
with two L's and a Y.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.771
It's at a 1925 West Wolcott...
Oh, my, oh, my God!

23:17.980 --> 23:19.147
Your truck!

23:20.149 --> 23:21.357
No!

23:21.942 --> 23:23.318
No, no, no, no!

23:24.153 --> 23:25.320
Look out!

23:25.529 --> 23:26.529
Save the baby!

23:35.831 --> 23:37.332
Hey, that's
the Molly's truck!

23:47.968 --> 23:48.968
Morning, fellas.

23:51.972 --> 23:52.972
What?

23:53.057 --> 23:55.517
I've seen a lot of
firefighters make
the morning paper,

23:56.143 --> 23:57.143
but never like this.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.907
Connie?
Chief, you need something?

24:11.951 --> 24:14.160
You have been invited to
a friend's place
for Thanksgiving,

24:14.286 --> 24:16.162
sat down for a big, beautiful,
once-a-year meal.

24:16.539 --> 24:19.290
Got excited about, uh,
perfectly cooked turkey,

24:20.709 --> 24:21.960
and then they served up a ham.

24:22.837 --> 24:24.254
A ham?
Instead of turkey.

24:24.797 --> 24:27.340
Uh, no, I got that part,
but what I'm not sure about
is that...

24:27.466 --> 24:31.177
See? Tradition is important,
is it not?

24:32.012 --> 24:33.888
I suppose it is.
Thank you, Connie.

24:34.390 --> 24:35.598
A woman that understands.

24:35.766 --> 24:39.269
I mean, who knows if
the pilgrims ate turkey
at the first Thanksgiving.

24:39.645 --> 24:41.813
I mean, maybe they had nothing
but hams lined up for miles.

24:42.314 --> 24:46.734
But me? As long as I can
remember, turkey is the
traditional Thanksgiving food.

24:47.570 --> 24:50.405
And gravy, brown.
Made from the giblets
of the turkey.

24:50.906 --> 24:53.408
Not some fancy,
foo-foo stuff

24:53.492 --> 24:57.412
made with pears,
and sun dried tomatoes.

24:58.539 --> 25:00.206
I do like a good gravy.

25:00.958 --> 25:02.333
Gotta stand up for tradition,
Connie.

25:03.794 --> 25:05.086
Otherwise what do we have?

25:05.796 --> 25:07.005
Ham and pear gravy.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.176
Thank you, Connie.

25:20.269 --> 25:22.145
Here's what I remember
from the other night.

25:24.273 --> 25:25.273
Okay, I don't remember
anything.

25:26.275 --> 25:27.317
Hmm.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.279
You had to plug
your phone in.

25:31.447 --> 25:33.281
We went to Chloe's
apartment near the bar.

25:33.699 --> 25:34.699
You passed out
on the couch.

25:36.660 --> 25:37.744
And I didn't.

25:39.288 --> 25:40.955
So you and Chloe.

25:42.166 --> 25:43.166
Uh, yeah.

25:44.919 --> 25:46.586
What did,
what'd you think?

25:47.129 --> 25:48.504
I didn't know what to think.

25:48.839 --> 25:51.674
When I woke up, you were still
sawing logs on the couch,
so I just took off.

25:52.176 --> 25:54.135
Oh, thank God.

25:54.678 --> 25:55.803
Wait. Did...

25:56.889 --> 25:58.097
You thought you...
I...

26:01.227 --> 26:03.978
So much for me
drying out.
Yeah.

26:07.107 --> 26:09.234
In my defense,
the emergency brake
should not be right there.

26:09.318 --> 26:10.652
You were supposed
to chock the tires!

26:10.778 --> 26:11.861
Mouch was supposed
to do that!

26:12.029 --> 26:13.488
Do we even have tire chocks?

26:13.739 --> 26:16.282
Never in all my life
have I been that humiliated.

26:18.869 --> 26:20.161
I beg to differ.
Yeah, me too.

26:21.538 --> 26:23.206
Look, look. Any press is
good press, right?

26:28.504 --> 26:29.796
Yeah, except that.

26:30.256 --> 26:34.842
Yeah. That reads like,
"Molly's is responsible for
the death of Jesus, again!"

26:35.177 --> 26:36.302
That truck is cursed.

26:36.387 --> 26:37.762
It is not the truck's fault,
all right.

26:37.888 --> 26:40.807
I gave you guys eight weeks
to make money out of
the name Molly's Two.

26:40.891 --> 26:42.183
That was a challenge.

26:42.309 --> 26:45.812
But you, you never said...
But, but, but how much
money have you made?

26:46.105 --> 26:47.355
We're just getting started.

26:50.317 --> 26:51.317
You're fired!

27:06.917 --> 27:08.042
Hey.

27:08.210 --> 27:09.919
Did you know Kim Kardashian
went to an all-girls school?

27:11.213 --> 27:13.589
That explains a lot.
Um, I got you something.

27:14.383 --> 27:15.425
What's this?

27:15.718 --> 27:18.386
It's nothing really.
I know I jumped your case
a while back,

27:19.013 --> 27:20.638
and you stepped up.
I want to say thank you.

27:20.723 --> 27:21.931
Aw.

27:22.808 --> 27:26.019
Ambulance 61, injuries from
a fall. 815. South Nebraska.

27:27.229 --> 27:28.271
That's around the corner.

27:28.355 --> 27:29.564
I'll open this after the call.
Yeah.

27:55.257 --> 27:57.216
Where'd he fall from?
You fell, sir?

27:58.552 --> 28:00.928
My legs, my legs, my legs.
Okay, deep breaths.

28:01.096 --> 28:02.764
- What's your name?
- Walter.

28:03.057 --> 28:04.974
Could you help me,
help me, help me, help me?

28:07.102 --> 28:08.936
He didn't fall.
He was run over.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.445
He's passed out
from blood loss.
Let's get him to Chicago Med.

28:20.491 --> 28:21.657
Who's that?

28:33.629 --> 28:35.505
Hyphenated last name.
Can you believe that?

28:36.131 --> 28:37.340
So the kid,
he has three names.

28:37.966 --> 28:39.801
You put in the middle name,
that's four.
That's ridiculous!

28:40.636 --> 28:42.220
No, yeah, yeah, I agree.

28:42.805 --> 28:44.180
What was your mother's
maiden name?

28:44.598 --> 28:45.765
Yeah, um, Pancholiza.

28:45.849 --> 28:48.643
Can you even imagine saying,
"Hi, I'm Brian. What was it?"

28:48.811 --> 28:50.436
Pancholiza.
"Pancholiza Zvonecek."

28:51.021 --> 28:53.189
Imagine kindergarten,
writing that at the top
of the damn page.

28:53.440 --> 28:54.649
Whoa! No.
That would have been...

28:54.691 --> 28:55.900
Where would you be
sitting right now?
Huh?

28:56.235 --> 28:59.987
You, you would be
an accountant,
or working in a bakery

29:00.489 --> 29:01.489
or something like that.

29:01.615 --> 29:03.783
Yeah. Huh! I don't,
I don't know that,
that would...

29:05.953 --> 29:07.328
I mean, yeah. Totally.

29:07.663 --> 29:09.205
Utterly asinine, right?
Mmm.

29:12.543 --> 29:13.584
Chief?
What?

29:15.379 --> 29:16.921
You and Donna,

29:18.507 --> 29:19.841
you're gonna make
great parents.

29:23.554 --> 29:24.554
Yeah?

29:24.680 --> 29:27.723
Uh, Chief a Mac McCoy
from the city building
department is on the phone.

29:28.225 --> 29:29.725
Yeah, yeah, Connie,
I'll take it.

29:30.436 --> 29:31.436
I...

29:33.272 --> 29:34.772
Thank you.
Yeah.

29:38.902 --> 29:39.986
Chief Boden.

29:42.739 --> 29:43.865
Was it good?
Did you watch last night?

29:43.949 --> 29:44.949
Hey, Kelly.

29:45.868 --> 29:46.868
Fire from last shift.

29:47.578 --> 29:49.537
City's looking to
condemn the structure,
want us to take a look.

29:50.372 --> 29:52.331
Yeah, we'll head over there.
Thanks.

29:54.835 --> 29:56.627
I'd slap the red X on it
if it were up to me.

29:57.087 --> 29:58.588
You guys hear
anything more from the wife?

29:59.423 --> 30:00.423
Uh, she's still in
the burn unit.

30:01.925 --> 30:03.217
You guys know Doctor Kendra
over there?

30:05.304 --> 30:06.804
She sometimes keeps me
posted on things.

30:07.890 --> 30:09.223
Yeah, I know her.
She's a lesbian.

30:09.850 --> 30:11.058
Interesting.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.441
All right, yeah,
this place is done.
Let's get...

30:25.699 --> 30:26.741
What?

30:27.993 --> 30:29.994
The fire started here and here

30:31.914 --> 30:32.914
and there.

30:34.249 --> 30:35.750
Three different places
at the same time.

30:39.046 --> 30:40.046
That son of a bitch.

30:40.964 --> 30:42.590
Call OFI and the CPD,
will you?

30:43.133 --> 30:44.133
On it.

30:56.313 --> 30:57.522
That's him, right there.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.190
Mr. Carlisle?

31:00.234 --> 31:01.776
You need to come with us.
We've got some questions.

31:05.572 --> 31:06.614
Yeah, sure.

31:12.329 --> 31:13.621
You were burned yourself,
buddy.

31:13.997 --> 31:17.041
How the hell could you
do that to another person?
Your own wife?

31:30.639 --> 31:34.141
Maybe we could, uh, mmm,
no, never mind.

31:36.687 --> 31:37.728
What about...

31:39.856 --> 31:40.856
Forget it.

32:01.086 --> 32:02.336
Hey, Chaplain.

32:02.629 --> 32:03.629
Ah!

32:04.590 --> 32:06.173
You raised some money
for us, Christopher?

32:07.884 --> 32:09.010
Yeah.

32:11.763 --> 32:13.598
Is this the best
you could do for us, 51?

32:14.766 --> 32:17.435
No, Chaplain. Not exactly.

32:26.653 --> 32:29.280
Your new soup kitchen now
has its own set of wheels.

32:30.657 --> 32:32.533
Just know the parking brake
can be a little tricky.

32:37.998 --> 32:41.125
This is the best Christmas
gift this old Chaplain's
ever gotten.

32:41.335 --> 32:42.543
Merry Christmas, Father!

32:43.879 --> 32:45.546
There you go, brother.
All right.

32:46.506 --> 32:48.049
Hey!

32:49.551 --> 32:50.885
Let us show you the inside.

33:00.479 --> 33:01.562
It's all yours, Padre.

33:02.898 --> 33:04.231
Careful with
the parking brake!

33:14.618 --> 33:15.951
Anyone heard from
Mills and Brett?

33:16.912 --> 33:18.037
Nope.
No.

33:20.582 --> 33:21.582
Hey.

33:22.584 --> 33:24.752
Does a fireman named Matt
work here?

33:26.254 --> 33:29.006
Um, yeah. Yeah, he does.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.384
He left his cellphone
in my apartment.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.427
Can you give it
to him for me?

33:34.179 --> 33:35.179
Excuse me?

33:42.270 --> 33:43.312
Found your phone!

33:43.605 --> 33:45.564
Because you left it
in some blonde
bimbo's apartment!

33:45.857 --> 33:46.941
Wait, I can explain that.

33:47.109 --> 33:49.276
Great. Explain it.
I'd really love to hear it.

33:50.153 --> 33:52.738
Me and Severide.
We, we went back to that
girl's apartment

33:52.823 --> 33:54.949
to plug in my phone.
I fell asleep on the couch.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.034
Severide is the one
who slept with her.

33:57.202 --> 33:58.327
And this is how
you wanna tell me?

33:58.787 --> 34:00.579
Tell you what?
Nothing happened.

34:00.664 --> 34:02.581
You know, Kelly really brings
out the worst in you.

34:02.833 --> 34:04.750
What brings out the worst
in me is you telling Mills

34:04.876 --> 34:06.252
you don't know if
you want to be with me.

34:06.712 --> 34:08.129
You think an apology was
gonna fix that?

34:08.213 --> 34:09.964
I thought we agreed that
we were past that!

34:10.173 --> 34:11.382
Well, apparently not.

34:15.846 --> 34:17.680
Maybe this whole thing is
too big for us.

34:18.974 --> 34:22.977
I'm trying to be a lieutenant,
and your fiance, and you can't
respect either one.

34:30.819 --> 34:32.528
Request permission
to leave shift, Lieutenant.

34:35.115 --> 34:36.323
Granted, Candidate.

34:46.877 --> 34:50.379
You know,
I was gonna drop it
and not say anything else.

34:50.630 --> 34:52.923
In fact, I've kept
my mouth shut all week.

34:53.884 --> 34:55.843
But then I thought
to myself,

34:56.136 --> 34:59.430
"Why shouldn't I have some say
in the naming of my child?"

34:59.514 --> 35:02.725
Donna. My family name
is important to me,
there are traditions involved.

35:02.976 --> 35:04.894
Oh, well, some traditions
need to be put to bed.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.103
Not this one.

35:07.397 --> 35:12.693
You sound like some old
dinosaur that can't even...
What? What?

35:12.944 --> 35:14.612
Hey, what is it?

35:15.238 --> 35:16.697
I think it's coming.
Well, what's coming?

35:17.032 --> 35:18.616
Oh, uh, oh, God.

35:18.992 --> 35:20.451
Could I have some help
up in here?

35:20.535 --> 35:21.535
Breathe, breathe.

35:23.914 --> 35:25.498
Breathe. She's going
into labor.

35:25.582 --> 35:27.541
Where are our paramedics?
Uh, out.

35:27.918 --> 35:29.376
Uh, where's Dawson?
Went home sick.

35:29.544 --> 35:31.754
Look here. I'm here.
I'm right here, baby.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.215
Ah... ah... Squad. Everyone,
let's help, help her.

35:34.299 --> 35:36.175
Let's go, let's go.
Help carry her.

35:37.052 --> 35:38.636
She'll be fine. Come on,
come on, come on.

35:44.059 --> 35:45.518
Okay, okay, okay.

35:46.895 --> 35:47.895
Go.

36:18.093 --> 36:19.343
Oh, my God!
Tony, get us moving!

36:19.427 --> 36:20.678
There's nowhere to go, Chief!
Oh, my God!

36:20.762 --> 36:21.929
What is it?
Oh, the baby's coming!

36:22.514 --> 36:24.265
What?
The baby is coming!

36:24.891 --> 36:26.058
The baby is coming!

36:29.646 --> 36:32.106
Look at me. Okay?
Lay down.

36:32.774 --> 36:33.983
Okay, okay, okay.
Come here, baby.

36:36.611 --> 36:37.611
Lay back down.

36:37.696 --> 36:38.696
You ever done this before,
Chief?

36:38.780 --> 36:40.739
More times than I can count.
Just never with my own son.

36:40.991 --> 36:43.158
Hey, do you want me to...
Not a chance in hell.

36:43.577 --> 36:45.744
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Wallace.
I'm right here.

36:45.829 --> 36:47.079
Wallace, don't.
I'm right here.

36:47.247 --> 36:48.956
This old dinosaur knows what
he's doing, I promise you.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.042
Anyway, what's better than
to bring little Terrance
in the world

36:52.127 --> 36:53.377
than from a CFD Squad Truck?

36:54.379 --> 36:55.588
Okay?
Okay.

36:55.797 --> 36:57.298
Lie back down,
and just breathe.

36:58.174 --> 37:00.134
Okay, baby,
I can see the crown.

37:00.302 --> 37:01.260
Okay.

37:01.344 --> 37:03.095
He's coming.
He's crowning.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.097
Okay?

37:05.599 --> 37:06.765
Honey,
I'm gonna need you to push.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.435
No, I can't do this.

37:09.728 --> 37:10.811
Yes, you can.

37:11.021 --> 37:12.646
Yes, you can. Look at me,
look at me.

37:13.273 --> 37:15.065
It's just you and me.
Okay?

37:15.901 --> 37:18.068
It's just you and me.
You can do this.

37:18.528 --> 37:19.778
Come on.
Okay.

37:20.113 --> 37:21.196
Now.

37:21.990 --> 37:23.991
And push!

37:27.954 --> 37:29.997
Yes, you're doing great,
you're doing great.
Doing so good.

37:30.457 --> 37:31.749
Oh, God.
Okay.

37:31.833 --> 37:34.168
I'm just gonna need
one more little push.
One more little push. Okay?

37:35.295 --> 37:36.337
Okay.

37:41.343 --> 37:44.011
Oh, my God. He's out, baby.
He's out.

37:49.059 --> 37:51.352
We got our little boy.
I got our little boy.

38:01.988 --> 38:02.988
Oh, gosh.
Oh.

38:11.039 --> 38:12.164
Here he is.

38:13.833 --> 38:14.875
You did good, baby.

38:16.544 --> 38:17.544
So good.

38:18.213 --> 38:19.338
You did good.

39:32.954 --> 39:36.081
Hey, Lieutenant.
We still haven't heard
hide nor hair of Ambo

39:36.166 --> 39:37.374
since they left this morning.

39:42.672 --> 39:45.299
Yeah,
this is Lieutenant Casey
at 51.

39:45.467 --> 39:47.801
Do you guys have
a location on Ambulance 61,
please?

39:51.931 --> 39:53.682
Okay. You know what?

39:54.142 --> 39:56.143
We're gonna run by there
and have a look. Thanks.

39:57.645 --> 40:00.314
Sixty-one is still on scene
at 815 South Nebraska.

40:00.815 --> 40:03.192
The alarm office said
their computers have been
up and down all day

40:03.276 --> 40:04.359
and they haven't
been able to check status.

40:04.986 --> 40:06.653
Let's go.
Yeah, load up.

40:29.594 --> 40:30.636
Terrance Boden.

40:34.140 --> 40:35.641
Some traditions are
worth keeping.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.898
Thank you.

40:50.198 --> 40:51.198
Okay.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.701
I don't wanna let him go.
It's okay.

40:56.204 --> 40:57.204
Hi!

40:59.707 --> 41:01.416
Doctor,
the baby's turning blue.

41:03.711 --> 41:04.711
What's going on?

41:05.296 --> 41:06.380
Wallace!

41:06.923 --> 41:08.382
Respiratory distress.
Meconium aspiration.

41:08.466 --> 41:09.883
Lungs aren't
absorbing oxygen.

41:10.260 --> 41:11.426
Wallace, what's going on?

41:11.761 --> 41:13.637
Call respiratory
and let peds know that
we're on our way, now!

41:13.721 --> 41:15.013
Come talk to me now!

41:15.098 --> 41:17.057
No. What's happening?

41:54.596 --> 41:55.637
Mills?

41:56.931 --> 41:57.931
Brett?
