It's designed that way
as a fail safe.

16:50.186 --> 16:53.055
The same for auxiliary
breather for life support.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.013
It's why we're still alive

16:54.056 --> 16:55.600
after the main system failure.

16:55.631 --> 16:59.148
Wow, well, maybe whoever
designed the food dispenser

16:59.192 --> 17:02.282

17:13.287 --> 17:14.771
Sir, I'm Eve Miller.

17:14.803 --> 17:16.388
I don't care who you are.

17:16.420 --> 17:18.291
I'm only concerned with
what you did on the Sagan

17:18.321 --> 17:20.053
and how it will help us survive.

17:20.865 --> 17:23.098
You mean how she and these
other roaches broke protocol

17:23.128 --> 17:25.087
and have endangered us both?

17:25.388 --> 17:28.699
Sir, I am a Lieutenant
with the UGS,

17:28.743 --> 17:30.440
a lead navigation systems manager.

17:30.484 --> 17:33.662
Lieutenant means
nothing on a non-citizen.

17:36.181 --> 17:37.182
Where are we?

17:38.579 --> 17:40.154
I'm not quite.

17:40.405 --> 17:41.998
What do you know?

17:44.168 --> 17:45.168
Sir,

17:45.847 --> 17:47.936
we traveled at high velocity
for 33 hours

17:47.979 --> 17:50.025
before we were able to
stabilize.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.766
How far we went
is impossible to tell

17:51.809 --> 17:53.855
because the positioner's
non-responsive

17:53.898 --> 17:56.483
as are all other nav com
systems.

17:58.404 --> 17:59.623
Continue.

17:59.858 --> 18:01.602
I believe I can create
a patch override

18:01.645 --> 18:03.139
that will allow me to get a
fixed position

18:03.169 --> 18:06.433
so we can head back towards
the main UGS caravan route.

18:06.733 --> 18:08.648
We can restore
significant thrust.

18:08.747 --> 18:10.319
It's our only chance...

18:11.864 --> 18:13.029
Is she correct?

18:14.275 --> 18:15.608
I agree with her.

18:16.486 --> 18:20.272
Most of the circuitry appears
damaged beyond repair.

18:21.322 --> 18:23.194
If we use it to
restore thrust

18:24.087 --> 18:26.537
we'd also be depleting
our life support system.

18:27.410 --> 18:28.759
Our current calculations show

18:28.803 --> 18:31.587
that we have no more than
22 days of oxygen left.

18:31.618 --> 18:34.889
The sustained thrust will
deplete us by five to seven
days.

18:36.202 --> 18:37.507
The risk is too great.

18:37.551 --> 18:40.380
I thought all pods had
at least 60 days

18:40.423 --> 18:41.511
to ensure enough time

18:41.555 --> 18:44.037
for at least three ships'
travel time.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.603
We should have had 40 days

18:47.498 --> 18:49.350
but with the damage done and...

18:50.043 --> 18:51.043
And what?

18:51.866 --> 18:54.725
These pods were designed to
optimally sustain four lives.

18:56.396 --> 18:57.788
We have a fifth passenger.

18:57.832 --> 18:59.108
Which is why we have
to get back

18:59.138 --> 19:01.009
to the main UGS caravan route.

19:01.052 --> 19:02.198

19:02.228 --> 19:04.055
We can't afford to stay here.

19:04.099 --> 19:06.580
Yeah, I mean,
we gotta figure out.

19:06.623 --> 19:09.359

to have an opinion?

19:10.149 --> 19:11.898
What is your specialty?

19:15.005 --> 19:16.354
I tended livestock.

19:17.063 --> 19:18.635

19:26.047 --> 19:28.123

19:28.369 --> 19:30.022

19:31.538 --> 19:33.625
This is not a democracy.

19:34.825 --> 19:36.175

What information did you
get from her?

01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:06.427
What have you done?

01:20:06.458 --> 01:20:07.759
I followed your
recommendation.

01:20:07.803 --> 01:20:09.326
I administered another stimulant

01:20:09.369 --> 01:20:11.284
and have been waiting
for your return.

01:20:11.328 --> 01:20:13.379
What did we get?

01:20:13.557 --> 01:20:15.700
I scrubbed through everything.

Now there will be plenty

You would have been
a good father.
