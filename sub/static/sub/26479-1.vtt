01:44.804 --> 01:46.739
- It's
the worst winter storm

01:46.739 --> 01:48.575
to hit parts of the northwest.

01:48.575 --> 01:52.178
If the model holds true the
Interstate 84 corridor area

01:52.178 --> 01:53.580
will be in the bull's eye.

01:53.580 --> 01:57.016
Spokane, Helena,
Boise and even Seattle

01:57.016 --> 01:59.953
could also get buried
in a 24 hour period

01:59.953 --> 02:03.289
and could top the so
called Knickerbocker Storm,

02:03.289 --> 02:04.724
the region's worst on record.

02:04.724 --> 02:05.892
Was after a theater

02:05.892 --> 02:06.960
where the roof--

02:06.960 --> 02:08.561
killing 100 people.

02:08.561 --> 02:10.229
- In more recent
memory, there was Snowpocalypse

02:10.229 --> 02:13.366
and Snowmageddon in 20--

02:13.366 --> 02:16.369
Storms just days apart
crippled the northeast.

02:16.369 --> 02:17.971
These are all--

02:17.971 --> 02:21.040
Tracking what's to come--

02:21.040 --> 02:22.275
- Tom,
how confident are you

02:22.275 --> 02:24.043
this is going to be one
for the history books?

02:24.043 --> 02:26.479
- Steve, Steve,
here's a word of advice.

02:26.479 --> 02:28.148
I know you gotta show
the rest of the week,

02:28.148 --> 02:29.749
and you're showing Saturday.

02:29.749 --> 02:32.185
Well, pack more than a
weekend in a weekend bag.

02:32.185 --> 02:34.687
The Knickerbocker
Storm dropped 28 inches

02:35.455 --> 02:36.689
and this could be more.

02:36.689 --> 02:38.591
We are going to be hammered by--

02:39.959 --> 02:42.162
Gale force winds and
possible white out conditions

02:42.162 --> 02:43.496
as the storm bails through the--

02:44.731 --> 02:45.965
And it could come
more than once.

02:45.965 --> 02:50.537
We could have wave--

03:05.018 --> 03:06.819
- Can't even get
a signal out here.

03:08.121 --> 03:09.822
- Did you mix the Ambien
and the Xanax bottle?

03:09.822 --> 03:12.025
I'm going to need something
to sleep on the plane.

03:15.428 --> 03:17.931
- I think you turn
on the next one.

03:19.399 --> 03:21.601
Guys, it's this one coming up.

03:21.601 --> 03:22.502
- He's right.

03:25.738 --> 03:26.639
Turn Paul.

03:32.278 --> 03:35.148
And he's been here twice
and he can remember.

03:44.290 --> 03:45.525
What?

03:50.930 --> 03:52.665
You're the one that
wanted time alone.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.235
- I thought we both did.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.670
- Yeah.

04:48.488 --> 04:49.555
Not helpful.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.595
- Ain't that something?

04:57.130 --> 05:00.600
Her cousin dies and I turn it
into alone time with your mom.

05:01.934 --> 05:04.003
I hope you grow up
to be smoother than me.

05:05.571 --> 05:06.839
- That's okay.

05:08.308 --> 05:11.144
- If we had more time we
could've planned differently.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.378
Try to enjoy yourself.

05:13.846 --> 05:14.747
- Yeah.

05:16.282 --> 05:18.551
- It'll be like that
scout camp last summer.

05:20.553 --> 05:21.587
- I hated that too.

05:23.089 --> 05:24.557
- You aced everything there.

05:25.558 --> 05:26.926
- Doesn't mean I liked it.

05:33.032 --> 05:34.801
Dad.
- Hmm?

05:36.936 --> 05:38.237
- What's Mom doing?

05:49.215 --> 05:50.850
- Wait here.

06:03.329 --> 06:07.233
I can't wait to hear
what I've done wrong now.

06:09.635 --> 06:11.404
- You remember how I
told you my mom died

06:11.404 --> 06:12.905
of cancer when I was little?

06:14.006 --> 06:15.441
Maybe Henry's age
and then I went

06:15.441 --> 06:17.310
to boarding schools after that.

06:17.310 --> 06:18.211
- Yeah.

06:19.812 --> 06:22.415
- Well, she didn't die of
cancer, she killed herself.

06:24.484 --> 06:25.385
- Jesus.

06:26.753 --> 06:32.825
- My dad had an affair or
something, he did something

06:35.027 --> 06:36.796
and I don't like
coming back here.

06:39.432 --> 06:41.100
- Why would you lie about that?

06:43.970 --> 06:45.405
- You're missing the point.

06:54.046 --> 06:54.947
Hey Dad.

07:13.633 --> 07:14.534
- Jacob.

07:15.368 --> 07:16.602
You had us worried for a minute.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.671
Thought you might've forgotten.

07:18.671 --> 07:20.606
- I don't forget things.

07:24.210 --> 07:25.344
- All right.

07:25.344 --> 07:28.014
Well, I'll get Henry.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.204
All right, let's go.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.179
- You said you were
dropping off a boy.

08:00.179 --> 08:02.949
I see a full grown
working man here.

08:02.949 --> 08:05.117
- So how's the
cellphone reception out here?

08:05.117 --> 08:06.486
- I wouldn't know.

08:07.286 --> 08:08.187
- Right.

08:09.255 --> 08:11.591
But you're neighbors
got a landline in case--

08:11.591 --> 08:13.259
- That's how I got your message.

08:14.961 --> 08:16.929
- And you've got
your cellphone Henry.

08:18.297 --> 08:20.066
- Right here.

08:20.066 --> 08:21.033
- Thanks for doing this Dad.

08:21.033 --> 08:23.135
We appreciate it.

08:23.135 --> 08:24.971
- Yes, thanks.

08:29.375 --> 08:32.078
Well, we better get going.

08:32.078 --> 08:34.013
- Yeah well don't
let me keep you.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.082
- We're barely
gonna make it as it is.

08:37.549 --> 08:39.919
- Listen to your
grandpa, call anytime.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.187
- Don't baby the boy.

08:42.121 --> 08:42.989
We'll be fine.

08:42.989 --> 08:43.856
Get over here.
- Hey.

08:44.891 --> 08:45.992
You be good.
- Yeah.

08:52.465 --> 08:55.434
- We'll be back
before you know it.

09:02.174 --> 09:04.644
- Come on, let's
get the work done.

09:04.644 --> 09:05.545
This way.

09:11.984 --> 09:15.154
A fool dropped this stuff

09:15.154 --> 09:18.391
two months late and
in the wrong place.

09:18.391 --> 09:23.462
Now, I need you to take it
from here and put it in here.

09:23.996 --> 09:24.864
- It stinks.

09:26.165 --> 09:28.134
- It's manure, it's
supposed to stink.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.639
It's work, work ain't fun.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.279
- What's this?

09:41.681 --> 09:42.648
- That's my dog.

09:45.618 --> 09:46.586
Loved that dog.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.356
A while back I found it
over by that stand of trees

09:50.356 --> 09:53.759
and it had been...

09:54.894 --> 09:55.795
It was dead.

09:58.030 --> 09:59.231
Waiting for the
ground to thaw out

09:59.231 --> 10:00.433
so I can give it
a proper burial.

10:00.433 --> 10:04.403
Now you get to work.

10:09.041 --> 10:09.942
Yeah.

10:11.911 --> 10:12.812
Come on.

10:17.783 --> 10:18.684
Oh.

10:19.919 --> 10:20.820
Damn it.

10:42.441 --> 10:44.010
- I finished all the shoveling.

11:01.894 --> 11:02.795
- All right.

11:23.916 --> 11:24.817
Here.

11:27.219 --> 11:28.187
- These all yours?

11:29.288 --> 11:30.189
- Just throw it.

11:39.765 --> 11:40.700
Grab another one.

11:43.135 --> 11:44.770
Now wind up, but don't throw it.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.507
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:48.507 --> 11:50.676
I want that kick up here,
as high as you can go.

11:50.676 --> 11:52.044
There you go.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.546
Now, with this hand I want you

11:53.546 --> 11:54.947
to come right over
the top with this.

11:54.947 --> 11:56.549
Look at me, look at me.

11:56.549 --> 12:00.219
Come right over the top and
finish as that leg goes down.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.020
Okay?
- Okay.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.088
- All in one motion.

12:06.859 --> 12:07.760
Do it again.

12:13.833 --> 12:15.367
Finish all the way through now.

12:30.349 --> 12:31.550
All right.

12:31.550 --> 12:32.952
Enough play.

12:32.952 --> 12:34.253
Get back to work.

12:38.290 --> 12:39.191
Come on now.

12:59.378 --> 13:00.312
What are you doing?

13:03.616 --> 13:04.483
- Nothing.

13:06.352 --> 13:08.387
- Go over to the shed
and get us some wood.

13:09.255 --> 13:10.523
- How much?

13:10.523 --> 13:13.459
- For you, two arm
loads, all right?

13:41.353 --> 13:43.823
Get up you old softy.

13:59.772 --> 14:04.743
Time to call it a
day.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.128
- Want wood?

15:00.599 --> 15:01.967
I heard him tell you that.

15:06.171 --> 15:08.007
- Who are you?

15:08.007 --> 15:09.909
- A friend of the old man's.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.377
I help him out all the time.

15:14.213 --> 15:15.814
I'm the one your mom talked to.

15:17.716 --> 15:18.918
I'm the one she called.

15:23.656 --> 15:26.725
I just live over there
through the trees.

15:32.731 --> 15:34.600
I should give you a
tour of the place.

15:37.703 --> 15:39.071
Come on.

15:39.071 --> 15:39.972
It'll be fun.

15:48.347 --> 15:49.581
- Hey!

15:58.657 --> 16:01.260
- I was just gonna show the
kid around a little bit.

16:03.162 --> 16:05.130
- Wood pile's over that way.

16:38.797 --> 16:39.698
- Okay.

17:36.388 --> 17:39.024
Smells good.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.094
How much longer?

17:45.130 --> 17:49.301
Why don't you amuse
yourself till then?

20:43.108 --> 20:46.511
What part of a locked
door means welcome to you?

20:46.511 --> 20:47.379
Hmm?

20:53.619 --> 20:54.920
- Was this my mom's room?

20:58.390 --> 20:59.258
- Yeah.

21:01.994 --> 21:04.296
- I've never seen a picture
of her as a kid before.

21:07.666 --> 21:10.035
- She likes to pretend like
it didn't exist.

21:12.237 --> 21:13.338
Come on, get your
butt downstairs.

21:13.338 --> 21:14.806
Dinner's about to be served.

21:31.456 --> 21:33.592
- Who was that guy today?

21:36.828 --> 21:40.365
- He's almost like family.

21:40.365 --> 21:41.433
Not like you though.

21:49.107 --> 21:50.942
He's been around here
since he was a kid.

21:50.942 --> 21:52.044
I helped him out.

21:52.944 --> 21:53.979
Now he helps me out.

21:56.915 --> 21:57.983
Most of the time.

22:01.053 --> 22:02.421
- He do something wrong today?

22:05.624 --> 22:06.525
- No.

22:08.226 --> 22:11.563
He just needs some
reminding.

22:21.039 --> 22:23.709
Come on now, don't wear
the pattern off that.

22:23.709 --> 22:28.780
- Okay.

22:38.557 --> 22:39.458
- Hey.

22:41.259 --> 22:43.328
Show me the split finger.

22:46.998 --> 22:48.266
Now the change up.

22:50.769 --> 22:53.505
Get that thumb over a little
closer to the forefinger.

22:58.944 --> 22:59.911
Yeah.

22:59.911 --> 23:00.912
Now the curve.

23:06.251 --> 23:07.219
Not bad.

23:13.525 --> 23:15.327
- Is this right
for a knuckle ball?

23:16.828 --> 23:18.430
- An arm like yours
you don't need

23:18.430 --> 23:20.132
to worry about junk like that.

23:21.833 --> 23:22.834
Too unpredictable.

23:23.802 --> 23:25.404
Stay with some regular pitches.

23:30.075 --> 23:32.811
- Mom says you don't
want to visit us.

23:32.811 --> 23:33.879
- She says that?

23:35.847 --> 23:36.748
- Yeah.

23:40.519 --> 23:42.187
- Everybody's got a story son.

23:43.922 --> 23:45.257
I guess that's hers.

23:48.627 --> 23:49.961
Life's funny that way.

23:51.596 --> 23:55.167
You're born, if you're
lucky you get some stuff.

23:55.167 --> 23:56.835
Most of it's going
to break down.

23:58.370 --> 24:02.774
You do your best to fix
what you can, then you die.

24:17.889 --> 24:21.693
Henry, have you
seen my toothbrush?

24:25.530 --> 24:26.431
Oh.

24:31.503 --> 24:33.038
You keep working that arm.

24:33.038 --> 24:34.339
You did good today son.

24:35.774 --> 24:36.908
- Thanks Grandpa.

24:38.343 --> 24:39.344
- Into bed.

24:39.344 --> 24:41.313
Tomorrow's another long day.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.216
Night night.
- Night.

27:42.560 --> 27:43.561
Tracking what's to come

27:43.561 --> 27:45.230
in the severe weather center.

27:45.230 --> 27:46.931
Tom, how confident
are you this is

27:46.931 --> 27:48.366
going to be one for
the history books?

27:58.510 --> 28:03.515

28:04.349 --> 28:08.687

29:05.844 --> 29:06.745
Grandpa!

29:12.383 --> 29:13.284
Grandpa?

29:22.127 --> 29:23.461
Wake up.

29:23.461 --> 29:24.362
Come on.

29:59.097 --> 30:00.031
Leave a message.

30:00.031 --> 30:02.634
I'll probably call you back.

30:02.634 --> 30:05.737
- Dad, Grandpa's dead.

30:05.737 --> 30:07.005
I went and checked
on him this morning.

30:07.005 --> 30:08.840
He wasn't breathing and
I didn't know what to do

30:08.840 --> 30:10.809
so I called you guys first.

30:12.343 --> 30:13.845
Dad, please.

30:13.845 --> 30:15.446
I think I need your help.

32:27.045 --> 32:28.346
Please, please.

32:41.125 --> 32:42.760
- You didn't tell
me Henry called.

32:44.929 --> 32:46.130
What'd his message say?

32:47.065 --> 32:48.266
- I haven't checked it.

32:49.934 --> 32:52.070
It's only a couple of days.

32:52.070 --> 32:54.339
It'll be good for him to
have some time away too.

32:54.339 --> 32:55.206
- Check it.

32:57.208 --> 32:58.242
- Okay, okay.

33:08.386 --> 33:11.289
First saved voice message.

33:11.289 --> 33:13.324
Dad, Grandpa's--

33:17.095 --> 33:18.162
Please help.

33:25.603 --> 33:30.675
Dad, Grandpa's--

33:31.376 --> 33:32.443
Please help.

33:39.751 --> 33:41.919
- Call him.
- I'm sure it's fine, just...

33:47.492 --> 33:52.363
- Hey,
this is Henry, leave a message.

33:52.363 --> 33:53.431
- Voicemail.

33:54.465 --> 33:55.333
Let me try his neighbor.

33:55.333 --> 33:56.300
What's his name?

33:57.368 --> 33:58.903
- Dixon.

34:15.520 --> 34:18.723
- Okay, they're out
working on farm stuff.

34:20.591 --> 34:23.327
What's the closest town
to your dad's place?

34:23.327 --> 34:24.896
- Percy.

34:30.234 --> 34:31.636
- Yeah, hi.

34:31.636 --> 34:33.538
My name's Paul Wilkes.

34:34.739 --> 34:37.375
I'm trying to get in
touch with our son.

34:37.375 --> 34:38.842
He's staying with
his grandfather--

35:01.099 --> 35:01.999
Mary.

35:04.235 --> 35:05.136
Mary.

35:07.638 --> 35:08.539
Mary.

35:10.441 --> 35:12.110
They're gonna dispatch someone.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.845
They said the storm came in.

35:13.845 --> 35:15.847
Apparently there's
another one on the way,

35:15.847 --> 35:18.216
but they're gonna call us.

35:19.484 --> 35:20.384
Happy?

35:22.887 --> 35:24.188
- We need to go back.

36:05.196 --> 36:06.831
- You shouldn't be seeing this.

36:08.866 --> 36:09.867
Go get your stuff.

36:11.302 --> 36:13.137
We're going back
to my place, okay?

37:11.395 --> 37:13.397
- Drink up boys.

37:13.397 --> 37:14.932
No hard feelings,
no assault charges,

37:14.932 --> 37:16.167
just the unknown pleasures of

37:16.167 --> 37:17.768
working through
insurance companies.

37:17.768 --> 37:19.403
All right.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.140
Munroe.

37:24.041 --> 37:24.942
Yeah.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.113
Hold on.

37:29.113 --> 37:30.147
You guys good here?

37:31.415 --> 37:32.316
- Yeah.

37:34.018 --> 37:35.219
- Okay, yeah say again.

37:38.623 --> 37:40.791
Oh gee, city people.

37:41.726 --> 37:43.527
Yep, they're the worst.

37:43.527 --> 37:44.428
Okay.

38:01.078 --> 38:02.313
- Hey.

38:02.313 --> 38:04.415
I'll make up some soup
and sandwiches huh?

38:08.919 --> 38:09.820
Want a drink?

38:11.355 --> 38:12.556
Coffee or something.

38:12.556 --> 38:14.025
- I need to call my parents.

38:16.093 --> 38:18.596
- Sorry dude, storm.

38:19.897 --> 38:23.801
Once it starts the
phones go down.

38:23.801 --> 38:24.735
- Can I try it?

38:25.536 --> 38:27.505
- I just said it doesn't work.

38:31.409 --> 38:33.644
Your parents will
be back soon right?

38:33.644 --> 38:35.713
Jacob said they were
going to a funeral.

38:45.389 --> 38:47.625
I can't believe he's gone.

38:51.529 --> 38:53.197
We'll just have to have some fun

38:54.765 --> 38:56.100
so we don't get all sad.

39:08.913 --> 39:09.814
Want some?

39:11.148 --> 39:13.317
- My parents don't really
like me drinking pop.

39:15.686 --> 39:16.554
- Our secret.

39:21.225 --> 39:23.094
Not like the old
man's around right?

39:39.276 --> 39:41.846
Oh it's getting bad out there.

39:47.651 --> 39:48.552
- Can I help?

39:52.056 --> 39:52.957
- No.

39:53.724 --> 39:54.625
You stay put.

39:57.828 --> 39:58.796
You're my guest.

40:04.335 --> 40:05.236
Okay?

40:10.841 --> 40:12.443
- Okay.

40:41.939 --> 40:43.140
- Here you go.

40:47.978 --> 40:49.914
- Looks like you
played some ball too?

40:52.082 --> 40:55.986
- Oh that, that's
my security system.

40:58.956 --> 41:00.724
I saw Jacob showing
you a few moves.

41:01.859 --> 41:03.360
Yeah, you know he used to be

41:03.360 --> 41:05.796
a terrific player
back in the day.

41:06.831 --> 41:11.669
Could've gone pro, but he
hurt his arm or something.

41:15.139 --> 41:16.240
That's life though.

41:17.575 --> 41:18.709
Stuff breaks.

41:20.344 --> 41:22.947
If you try to fix
it, doesn't work.

41:24.114 --> 41:26.050
Just gotta put it away.

41:27.151 --> 41:32.223
You know save the stuff
you have or whatever.

41:36.694 --> 41:38.329
Man he was tough, though.

41:40.397 --> 41:42.433
Thought the old prick
might outlive me.

41:45.402 --> 41:46.237
- Yeah.

41:49.106 --> 41:49.974
- Yeah.

41:53.244 --> 41:54.111
Hey.

41:55.045 --> 41:55.913
Soup.

41:57.414 --> 41:58.883
Tomato or cream of mushroom?

42:00.017 --> 42:01.418
- Tomato.

42:01.418 --> 42:02.453
- Nice.

42:03.721 --> 42:04.989
Hoping you'd say tomato.

42:16.967 --> 42:18.168
- Hey.

42:21.005 --> 42:22.306
- You got any games
on this computer?

42:22.306 --> 42:23.574
- No.

42:23.574 --> 42:28.045
That's just for work so
don't mess with it okay?

42:29.947 --> 42:34.418
The old man's friend
got me a part time job.

42:35.786 --> 42:40.758
Yeah, just some book keeping,
stuff around the farm.

42:45.796 --> 42:48.299
It's boring stuff for a
little guy though right?

42:49.433 --> 42:51.635
But a man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

42:52.870 --> 42:53.737
- Yep.

42:55.205 --> 42:58.309
Sounds like you have
some important jobs.

42:58.309 --> 42:59.777
- That's not all of them.

43:04.281 --> 43:05.616
What're you doing?

43:10.988 --> 43:13.490
- Just looking around.

43:15.059 --> 43:15.960
- Take a seat.

43:17.294 --> 43:21.098
You're making me nervous
wandering around like that.

43:25.669 --> 43:27.104
Relax dude.

43:35.980 --> 43:37.247
- Flight's been delayed.

43:43.120 --> 43:45.489
Hey, he's gonna be okay.

43:51.662 --> 43:52.596
- All right.

43:54.865 --> 43:56.467
Old man was a really good cook.

43:57.434 --> 43:58.569
I'm not in his league.

44:04.942 --> 44:08.646
You, me, drink race.

44:09.480 --> 44:11.348
Let's see who wins.

44:40.744 --> 44:42.246
- You're bigger than me.

44:42.246 --> 44:43.414
- Yeah.

44:44.748 --> 44:45.616
Come on.

44:46.817 --> 44:48.118
You still gotta finish.

44:50.287 --> 44:51.522
Don't be a sore loser.

44:59.463 --> 45:00.698
What kind of games do you like?

45:00.698 --> 45:04.902
- Assassin's Creed,
Call of Duty.

45:04.902 --> 45:06.303
Chess.

45:06.303 --> 45:07.404
- Chess?

45:07.404 --> 45:08.639
That's boring.

45:09.740 --> 45:12.876
Oh man, I'd smoke
you in Call of Duty.

45:12.876 --> 45:15.079
- I'm awesome at Call of Duty.

45:15.079 --> 45:17.347
- Doesn't fucking matter man.

45:17.347 --> 45:18.816
I'm like a god at that game.

45:24.221 --> 45:27.357
- I thought your computer
was just for work?

45:31.095 --> 45:33.597
- Well, I didn't say I
played it here did I?

45:38.635 --> 45:41.438
- You're a little
smart guy, huh?

45:42.606 --> 45:44.208
Smart ass.

45:44.208 --> 45:47.211
Old man would've never stood
for that kind of talk from me,

45:48.312 --> 45:51.115
but he's not here
right now is he?

45:52.416 --> 45:53.350
I'm in charge.

45:57.321 --> 45:58.589
He barely knew you.

45:59.623 --> 46:00.858
And you had him wrapped around

46:00.858 --> 46:02.826
your stupid little
fucking finger.

46:05.295 --> 46:09.833
He told me kid's off limits.

46:11.068 --> 46:12.870
That's Trisha's bloodline.

46:16.640 --> 46:19.510
He's always saying one thing
and meaning something else,

46:22.279 --> 46:24.047
but I read between
the lines Hank.

46:28.218 --> 46:32.422
Can I call you Hank,
like Hank Aaron?

46:34.625 --> 46:35.526
Hanky panky.

46:41.498 --> 46:42.833
He always made me prove myself

46:42.833 --> 46:45.102
because he knew I
could handle it.

46:46.436 --> 46:48.972
Just wanted to see if I
really wanted it bad enough.

46:54.178 --> 46:56.513
You're a lot like him you know?

46:56.513 --> 46:59.983
Doing one thing,
meaning another.

47:01.718 --> 47:02.619
Pretending.

47:04.021 --> 47:04.922
He was nice.

47:06.924 --> 47:08.158
And he wasn't.

47:09.226 --> 47:10.127
I see you.

47:11.829 --> 47:12.930
I fucking see--

47:21.605 --> 47:22.673
Oh fuck.

47:50.267 --> 47:52.169
Henry, we're not done!

47:54.872 --> 47:56.473
Henry!

51:04.394 --> 51:05.896
You doing this?

51:37.794 --> 51:41.364
- He'll be waiting
for you at the house.

52:06.990 --> 52:08.325
Nowhere else to go.

52:09.493 --> 52:10.527
Has to be there.

52:17.534 --> 52:19.035
- I have to do it don't I?

52:27.777 --> 52:30.847
- You have to make
this one special.

52:30.847 --> 52:31.748
He's Mary's boy.

52:42.359 --> 52:44.995
Opportunities like
this, not to be wasted.

53:09.352 --> 53:10.253
- Yeah.

53:11.154 --> 53:12.055
- Yeah.

53:18.628 --> 53:19.529
- Yeah.

53:22.866 --> 53:23.767
- Special.

54:07.677 --> 54:08.578
Hey kid.

54:10.914 --> 54:12.082
You in there?

54:20.190 --> 54:23.827
That would be tricky.

55:02.432 --> 55:04.100
- Jane, you gotta
make a pit stop.

55:06.136 --> 55:07.337
Signal's pretty busted,

55:07.337 --> 55:08.338
but if you can
hear me looks like

55:08.338 --> 55:10.273
Wilma went into the ditch again.

55:11.107 --> 55:12.676
Gonna wait and see if Billy

55:12.676 --> 55:15.078
or somebody's coming
to get her out.

55:55.552 --> 55:56.419
- Henry.

55:59.155 --> 56:00.256
I got you something.

56:10.767 --> 56:12.769
The old man loved that dog.

56:14.170 --> 56:17.240
Me I didn't like it much.

56:24.814 --> 56:26.416
The old man loved you too.

56:41.097 --> 56:41.998
Henry.

56:50.340 --> 56:54.477
You know I wasn't allowed
in here over the years.

56:55.512 --> 57:00.049
Old man liked
everything just so.

57:02.185 --> 57:05.555
He didn't like people
touching his stuff.

57:47.864 --> 57:48.765
Henry.

57:51.634 --> 57:52.702
I hope you're okay.

58:08.518 --> 58:10.420
You nasty little fuck.

58:33.576 --> 58:34.978
You little fuck!

58:57.600 --> 58:58.501
Fuck.

59:10.980 --> 59:12.482
You stupid prick.

59:21.090 --> 59:21.991
Hey!

01:00:49.112 --> 01:00:50.580
- No.

01:01:51.474 --> 01:01:52.975
- The boy is smart.

01:01:54.811 --> 01:01:55.878
Real smart.

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:01.984
Smart like me.

01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:10.727
- Footprints.

01:02:11.627 --> 01:02:13.496
- Ah, yes.

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:16.733
Now you're getting it.

01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:28.745
- No footprints.

01:02:55.438 --> 01:03:02.445
The old man never
shut the pantry door.

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:07.116
The door stuck.

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:14.183
Looks like you went
out into the cold.

01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:22.325
Smart kid.

01:04:30.933 --> 01:04:33.135
You sure showed me.

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.481
Hi Henry.

01:05:22.818 --> 01:05:24.887
Getting predictable kid.

01:06:03.159 --> 01:06:04.060
- What?

01:06:07.997 --> 01:06:09.198
- He must be safe.

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:13.202
He's safe right Paul?

01:06:19.108 --> 01:06:24.180
I was the one who found my
mom in the barn.

01:06:25.481 --> 01:06:26.849
She was safe.

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:32.154
Paul you can be
totally safe and happy

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:37.226
and then
something happens.

01:06:39.695 --> 01:06:41.597
- Hey, hey.

01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:01.017
- Hi Dad.

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:06.555
He never let me call him that.

01:07:11.293 --> 01:07:12.962
Mary didn't know either,

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:17.566
but I bet she could
sense something.

01:07:20.903 --> 01:07:23.205
Now stay right there.

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:43.592
- Mom didn't leave
a note, nothing.

01:07:46.162 --> 01:07:48.697
I knew that Dad knew
why and he wouldn't say.

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:56.672
And this one time a few
years later he sat me down

01:07:57.807 --> 01:07:59.675
in the kitchen he goes,
I'll never forget this,

01:07:59.675 --> 01:08:04.513
he goes I let her in and
she couldn't handle it.

01:08:08.684 --> 01:08:11.220
- What the hell does that mean?

01:08:12.054 --> 01:08:14.590
- I always win.

01:08:17.725 --> 01:08:19.028
Always.

01:08:19.862 --> 01:08:20.763
Okay?

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:25.701
You have her eyes.

01:08:28.837 --> 01:08:32.508
- He said I told her what
she'd been wanting to know,

01:08:34.009 --> 01:08:37.880
showed her, and it ate her up.

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:46.322
- Now we can play
a different game.

01:08:50.693 --> 01:08:56.765
- And the next thing I know he's
taking in that neighbor guy

01:09:00.435 --> 01:09:02.837
like some kind of stray dog.

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:08.711
- But first I owe
you some hurts.

01:09:15.384 --> 01:09:16.919
- One out one in I guess,

01:09:16.919 --> 01:09:20.488
you know something breaks
down and you fix what you can.

01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:29.999
- Henry, don't be
afraid, it's just

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:32.301
a game and you did so good.

01:09:41.443 --> 01:09:43.578
- So I miss another time.

01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:48.216
Okay.

01:09:55.891 --> 01:10:00.963
- No.

01:10:01.363 --> 01:10:03.799
No!

01:10:56.485 --> 01:10:57.353
- Up here!

01:10:58.387 --> 01:10:59.255
Help!

01:11:00.589 --> 01:11:02.791
- Hey Janie listen,
Drew still on duty?

01:11:02.791 --> 01:11:03.926
Yeah, he's dealing

01:11:03.926 --> 01:11:07.529
with all the catastrophe
down on Main.

01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:10.266
- Okay yeah, maybe send him
down to the Yale's place.

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:11.800
- What's up?

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:14.203
- I don't know yet, but front
door's wide open in the storm.

01:11:15.304 --> 01:11:17.573
Could be nothing,
but it feels weird.

01:11:17.573 --> 01:11:19.575
I'm gonna go in
and check it out.

01:11:34.256 --> 01:11:35.391
- I'm up here!

01:11:35.391 --> 01:11:36.458
Help!

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:38.761
- Kid, you okay?

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:56.999
- Henry.

01:13:58.567 --> 01:14:00.202
Henry, come out.

01:16:26.515 --> 01:16:27.349
- Hey boy.

01:16:40.996 --> 01:16:43.632
You're not supposed to be here.

01:16:47.936 --> 01:16:50.238
- You get out of there boy!

01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:53.108
Right fucking now!

01:16:55.544 --> 01:16:56.445
- You in trouble?

01:17:01.683 --> 01:17:03.218
Know how to use that thing?

01:17:09.658 --> 01:17:12.060
The shells are on the shelf.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.302
Just load them in the barrel.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:25.574
It's too big.

01:17:25.574 --> 01:17:26.675
Bring it to me.

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:32.514
- You should not be in there.

01:17:32.514 --> 01:17:34.249
- Come on
boy, hurry now.

01:18:13.288 --> 01:18:14.756
- All out of tricks?

01:18:19.728 --> 01:18:20.629
Oh man.

01:18:22.264 --> 01:18:26.368
You are way way off limits here.

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:35.544
I mean you were always
gonna end up down here.

01:18:38.046 --> 01:18:42.417
Maybe deep down inside you knew

01:18:42.417 --> 01:18:44.786
this is where you
were supposed to be.

01:18:48.323 --> 01:18:49.224
Bat?

01:18:52.828 --> 01:18:53.729
Or gun?

01:18:58.166 --> 01:18:59.067
Oh.

01:19:00.869 --> 01:19:03.036
Maybe a little bit of both.

01:19:08.477 --> 01:19:10.278
You're stupid face.

01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:15.584
God you do look a lot like her.

01:19:20.222 --> 01:19:23.992
Now if your mom
is my half sister

01:19:27.863 --> 01:19:29.531
what does that make you?

01:19:35.637 --> 01:19:37.706
Mama?

01:19:41.042 --> 01:19:44.746
Mama you put that down.

01:19:47.082 --> 01:19:49.417
Right now.

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:34.796
- You were never ever
going to be good enough.

01:20:38.567 --> 01:20:40.168
That's why you were the secret.

01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:33.682
- Are you hurt?

01:22:43.291 --> 01:22:45.060
Is there anyone
else in the house?

01:22:49.698 --> 01:22:50.598
No?

01:23:01.076 --> 01:23:02.143
You're okay.

01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:10.885
I'd hate to see what
happened to the other guy.

01:23:56.064 --> 01:23:56.965
- Henry!

01:23:57.866 --> 01:23:59.167
- Henry!

01:24:06.441 --> 01:24:07.876
- Mom.

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:08.777
Dad.

01:24:11.012 --> 01:24:12.147
- Henry?
- Are you okay?

01:24:12.147 --> 01:24:13.481
- I'm fine.
- You're okay?

01:24:13.481 --> 01:24:14.449
Okay, okay.

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:25.360
I'm so sorry.

01:24:28.863 --> 01:24:29.764
You're okay.

01:24:34.002 --> 01:24:36.738
- Come on, let's go home.

01:24:46.414 --> 01:24:48.049
- What is it Henry?

01:25:02.197 --> 01:25:03.364
Come on baby.
