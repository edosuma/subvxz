00:22.857 --> 00:25.026
<i>Order up!</i>

00:45.171 --> 00:47.006
<i>I know what
you're thinking.</i>

00:48.841 --> 00:51.093
"What the heck do I
need a five spindle for,

00:51.218 --> 00:52.762
when I barely sell enough
milkshakes

00:52.887 --> 00:55.014
to justify my single spindle?"
Right?

00:55.139 --> 00:57.224
Wrong.

00:57.349 --> 00:59.119
Are you familiar with the notion
of the chicken or the egg,

00:59.143 --> 01:01.562
Mr. Griffith?
I mention it because,

01:01.687 --> 01:04.732
well, I think it applies here.

01:04.857 --> 01:06.817
Do you not need
the multi-mixer because,

01:06.942 --> 01:08.670
well heck, you're not
selling enough milkshakes?

01:08.694 --> 01:10.254
Or are you not selling
enough milkshakes

01:10.279 --> 01:11.989
because you don't
have a multi-mixer?

01:12.114 --> 01:14.366
I firmly believe
it's the latter.

01:14.492 --> 01:16.892
You see your customer comes in
here and he knows if he orders

01:16.994 --> 01:20.081
a shake from your establishment,
he's in for a terrific wait.

01:20.206 --> 01:21.892
He's done it before
and he thinks to himself,

01:21.916 --> 01:24.186
"Well by-golly, I'm not going to
make that mistake again."

01:24.210 --> 01:28.798
But if you had the Prince Castle
five spindle multi-mixer

01:28.923 --> 01:31.592
with patented
direct-drive electric motor,

01:31.717 --> 01:35.221
we greatly increase your
ability to produce delicious,

01:35.346 --> 01:37.056
frosty milkshakes fast.

01:37.181 --> 01:42.311
Mark my words,
dollars to donuts,

01:42.436 --> 01:45.773
you'll be selling more of those
sons-a-bitches

01:45.898 --> 01:49.318
than you can shake a stick at.

01:49.443 --> 01:54.031
You increase the supply,
and the demand will follow.

01:54.156 --> 01:55.574
Increase supply, demand follows.

01:55.699 --> 01:58.160
Chicken-egg.
Do you follow my logic?

01:58.285 --> 02:01.122
I know you do, because you're
a bright forward-thinking guy

02:01.247 --> 02:04.208
who knows a good idea
when he hears one.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.547
So, whaddaya say?

02:12.007 --> 02:15.010
- Nah, but thanks anyways.

02:15.136 --> 02:17.138
Order's up.

03:20.492 --> 03:23.120
- Miss? How much longer?

03:23.245 --> 03:25.725
- Should be a few more minutes.
- You said that 20 minutes ago.

03:25.831 --> 03:27.583
- I'm so sorry,
we're really busy today.

03:35.424 --> 03:37.184
<i>See, it only stands
to reason here, Bud,</i>

03:37.301 --> 03:39.970
if you increase supply,
demand will follow.

03:40.095 --> 03:42.389
Chicken and the egg.
Do you follow my logic?

03:42.514 --> 03:44.634
Of course you do, you're
a bright forward-thinking guy

03:44.725 --> 03:47.269
who knows a good idea
when he hears one.

03:48.771 --> 03:50.564
So?

03:50.689 --> 03:52.483
What do you say?

04:08.499 --> 04:10.459
Here we go.

04:10.584 --> 04:11.835
- What is...?
- Enjoy.

04:11.961 --> 04:14.296
- I ordered the barbeque beef!

04:22.346 --> 04:25.557
<i>There's a lot of good
leads, real-real strong leads.</i>

04:25.683 --> 04:27.601
Yeah. What?

04:27.726 --> 04:29.687
<i>Nothing. That's wonderful.</i>

04:29.812 --> 04:33.065
- Well, I mean, there's
just tremendous interest.

04:33.190 --> 04:34.525
- I'm sure there is.

04:34.650 --> 04:36.151
- You sound like you
don't believe me.

04:36.277 --> 04:37.820
- Of course, Ray.
Why wouldn't I?

04:37.945 --> 04:40.072
- All right. I've got a
lot of paperwork to do here.

04:40.197 --> 04:43.826
So ahh... I'll... I'll call you
from the road tomorrow.

04:43.951 --> 04:44.951
- Okay.

04:44.994 --> 04:46.662
- All right. Goodnight.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.909
<i>Persistence.</i>

05:26.035 --> 05:30.748
<i>Nothing in the world can
take the place of persistence.</i>

05:30.873 --> 05:33.500
<i>Talent won't;
nothing is more common</i>

05:33.625 --> 05:36.962
<i>than unsuccessful men
with talent.</i>

05:37.087 --> 05:38.922
<i>Genius won't;</i>

05:39.048 --> 05:43.344
<i>unrewarded genius
is practically a clich√©.</i>

05:43.469 --> 05:49.183
<i>Education won't; the world
is full of educated fools.</i>

05:49.308 --> 05:54.063
<i>Persistence and determination
alone are all powerful.</i>

05:54.188 --> 05:57.483
<i>Show that you don't have
to be defeated by anything.</i>

05:57.608 --> 06:01.070
<i>That you can have peace of
mind, improved health</i>

06:01.195 --> 06:03.739
<i>and a never ceasing
flow of energy.</i>

06:03.864 --> 06:07.534
<i>If you attempt each and every
day to achieve these things,</i>

06:07.659 --> 06:12.122
<i>the results will make
themselves obvious to you.</i>

06:12.247 --> 06:15.292
<i>While it may sound
like a magical notion,</i>

06:15.417 --> 06:19.171
<i>it is in you
to create your own future.</i>

06:19.296 --> 06:21.590
<i>The greatest discovery
of my generation</i>

06:21.715 --> 06:25.177
<i>is that human beings
can alter their lives</i>

06:25.302 --> 06:28.347
<i>by altering their attitudes
of mind.</i>

06:28.472 --> 06:31.850
<i>Or as Ralph Waldo Emerson
declared,</i>

06:31.975 --> 06:36.105
<i>"A man is what he
thinks about all day long."</i>

07:20.232 --> 07:21.960
Prince Castle Sales,
how can I help you?

07:21.984 --> 07:23.277
- Hi, June.

07:23.402 --> 07:24.421
<i>- Ray, how's it
going down there?</i>

07:24.445 --> 07:26.113
- Good, swell, lot of interest.

07:26.238 --> 07:28.115
- Hold on, let me
fetch your messages.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.741
<i>Let's see, Gene Rafferty</i>

07:29.867 --> 07:31.118
from United Aluminum

07:31.243 --> 07:32.661
<i>needs to reschedule Friday.</i>

07:32.786 --> 07:34.830
<i>Ed Nance calling
about the refund.</i>

07:34.955 --> 07:36.665
<i>Sloan and Sons,
they called again,</i>

07:36.790 --> 07:38.167
<i>we're sixty days past due.</i>

07:38.292 --> 07:39.960
<i>A lady from the
March of Dimes, oh...</i>

07:40.085 --> 07:43.130
We got an order, six mixers.

07:43.255 --> 07:44.631
- Six?
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

07:44.756 --> 07:46.341
<i>Some drive-in out in
California.</i>

07:46.467 --> 07:48.719
- Same place, one place.
No that's... that's impossible.

07:48.844 --> 07:50.071
- I've got the slip right here.

07:50.095 --> 07:52.556
- No, I'm sure you
misunderstood.

07:52.681 --> 07:53.741
You know what?
Give me the number.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.726
- You got a pen?
- Okay.

07:55.851 --> 07:57.478
All right.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.212
<i>- Hello, McDonald's.
- Hello, good afternoon.</i>

08:06.236 --> 08:07.464
May I please
speak with the owner.

08:07.488 --> 08:09.406
<i>- Which one?</i>
- I'm sorry?

08:09.531 --> 08:11.074
<i>- Dick or Mac?</i>

08:11.200 --> 08:12.840
- Ahh, whichever one's
available, I guess.

08:12.868 --> 08:14.036
<i>- Order up!
I need six fries!</i>

08:14.161 --> 08:15.996
<i>- Patties up!
- This is Dick.</i>

08:16.121 --> 08:20.083
- Hello, Dick, this is Ray Kroc
from Prince Castle Sales.

08:20.209 --> 08:22.187
The reason I'm calling is
someone placed an order...

08:22.211 --> 08:23.629
<i>- Yes. Yes, that was me.</i>

08:23.754 --> 08:25.464
<i>How soon can you
get them out here?</i>

08:25.589 --> 08:27.442
- Well, that's actually
why I'm phoning now, Dick.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.068
I think there might have been
some kind of miscommunication...

08:29.092 --> 08:31.386
<i>- Freezer! Top shelf!
Left side! Sorry.</i>

08:31.512 --> 08:33.054
- No problem.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.599
My secretary's under the
impression that you wanted six?

08:35.724 --> 08:38.227
<i>- Yeah, you know,
I think that was a mistake.</i>

08:38.352 --> 08:41.104
- Well, that's what I figured.
I mean, what kind of drive-in

08:41.230 --> 08:43.065
can make
30 milkshakes at a time.

08:43.190 --> 08:46.068
<i>- Better make it eight.
- What's that, Al?</i>

08:46.193 --> 08:47.402
<i>- There's a brand new box...</i>

08:47.528 --> 08:49.112
<i>- Look, now isn't
the best time.</i>

08:49.238 --> 08:52.074
- Yeah, I'm sorry. I understand.
I'm still a little bit...

08:52.199 --> 08:54.219
<i>- You know where to send them?
San Bernardino, California.</i>

08:54.243 --> 08:55.536
- Yeah.
<i>- Corner of 14th and E.</i>

08:55.661 --> 08:57.412
- Hold on a minute.
To anyone in particular?

08:57.538 --> 09:00.666
<i>- Just the store is fine.
McDonald's. Okay. Thanks a lot.</i>

09:00.791 --> 09:02.709
- Yeah.

10:55.697 --> 10:56.948
- Don't worry, it moves fast.

10:57.074 --> 10:58.283
- Really?

10:58.408 --> 10:59.648
Welcome to McDonald's.

10:59.743 --> 11:01.012
May I take your order?
- Here you go.

11:01.036 --> 11:02.954
French Fries?

11:03.080 --> 11:05.582
You guys have a great day.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.252
Hi, welcome to McDonald's.
May I take your order?

11:09.378 --> 11:13.090
- Yeah, give me a hamburger,
French fries and a Coca-Cola.

11:13.215 --> 11:15.717
- That'll be.35 cents, please.
- All right.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.932
Fifteen cents is your change.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.645
Here you are.

11:26.770 --> 11:29.481
- What's this?
- Your food.

11:29.606 --> 11:30.941
- No, no, no.
I just ordered.

11:31.066 --> 11:33.276
- And now it's here.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.029
- You sure?

11:36.154 --> 11:37.322
All right.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.865
Where are the umm...

11:38.990 --> 11:40.510
you know, the silverware
and plates and everything?

11:40.534 --> 11:42.369
- You just eat it
straight out of the wrapper,

11:42.494 --> 11:44.871
then you throw it all out.

11:44.996 --> 11:46.415
- All right.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.710
Really?

11:49.835 --> 11:51.294
Okay.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.631
Where do I eat it?

11:54.756 --> 11:56.717
- In your car.

11:56.842 --> 11:58.760
At the park.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.846
At home. Wherever you'd like.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.931
- Okay. Okay. Okay, thanks.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.422
- May we join you?
- Huh? Yeah. Sure.

12:35.547 --> 12:38.258
Thank you.
Have a seat.

12:55.192 --> 12:58.487
Just throw it right there
and I'll sweep it up.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.032
How is everything?

13:02.157 --> 13:03.700
- This might be
the best hamburger

13:03.825 --> 13:05.952
I've ever had in my life.
- Well, we aim to please.

13:06.077 --> 13:07.746
Mac McDonald.

13:11.666 --> 13:15.796
- Oh! Well, look at this...
Ray Kroc.

13:15.921 --> 13:18.149
- The Multi-Mixer fella.
You spoke with my brother, Dick.

13:18.173 --> 13:19.341
- I did yeah, yeah.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.801
- What are you doing
way out here?

13:20.926 --> 13:23.094
I'm in Los Angeles,
business meetings.

13:23.220 --> 13:24.540
I thought I'm in
the neighborhood,

13:24.638 --> 13:26.073
I should just swing by
and say hello.

13:26.097 --> 13:27.766
- Well, I'm sure glad you did.

13:27.891 --> 13:30.227
- This whole thing.
This is some operation.

13:30.352 --> 13:32.521
- Care for a little tour?

13:32.646 --> 13:33.730
- Of the...?
- Yeah.

13:33.855 --> 13:35.273
- Yeah, I would.

13:35.398 --> 13:36.667
- Well, then finish up,
I'll come back for you.

13:36.691 --> 13:38.318
- Alrighty. Thanks.

14:06.429 --> 14:09.224
<i>May I take your order?</i>

14:09.349 --> 14:12.143
<i>Two soft drinks and two fries.</i>

14:12.269 --> 14:14.104
<i>Anything else for you, sir?</i>

14:19.651 --> 14:21.611
- Speed, that's the
name of the game.

14:21.736 --> 14:23.947
The first stop for every
McDonald's hamburger

14:24.072 --> 14:25.907
is the grill.
Manned by two cooks

14:26.032 --> 14:29.327
whose sole job is to grill those
all-beef beauties to perfection.

14:29.452 --> 14:33.582
Meanwhile, as the patty cooks,
our dressers get the buns ready.

14:33.707 --> 14:36.001
Watch out. Burger crossing.

14:36.126 --> 14:38.128
- Burger crossing!
- Burger crossing!

14:38.253 --> 14:41.756
- Every McDonald's burger
has two pickles.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.596
A pinch of onions and a precise
shot of ketchup and mustard.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.282
- Now where'd you get those?
- We made them.

14:49.306 --> 14:50.932
- Made them!
- Yeah, custom built.

14:51.057 --> 14:54.311
The whole kitchen is.
Next is the finishing station

14:54.436 --> 14:56.813
where we put
the whole thing together.

14:59.316 --> 15:00.942
And...

15:03.445 --> 15:05.739
Voila, a fresh delicious burger
from grill to counter

15:05.864 --> 15:07.699
in 30 seconds.

15:09.159 --> 15:10.869
- How the heck did you
come up with this?

15:10.994 --> 15:14.247
- Oh I didn't. We did.
Dick McDonald, my brother.

15:14.372 --> 15:16.833
- Hi. I gotta tell you,
this is the most...

15:16.958 --> 15:18.376
Well, it's nice to meet you.

15:21.171 --> 15:23.131
- The fries.
- What about them?

15:23.256 --> 15:24.633
- They're five percent
too crisp.

15:26.468 --> 15:28.219
- No, they're perfect.

15:28.345 --> 15:30.639
- I think we should drop to
two minutes, fifty seconds.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.204
- Wasn't that what
we were at before?

15:32.265 --> 15:35.143
- 400, not 375.
Higher temp, shorter cook.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.103
- I think they're spot on.
- Excuse me, may I?

15:37.228 --> 15:39.397
None of my beeswax,
but I'm with the big fella here.

15:39.522 --> 15:41.232
I loved them.
Golden brown on the outside.

15:41.358 --> 15:43.026
Fluffy white inside.

15:43.151 --> 15:45.737
And they're not too
oily, salty, crunchy.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.530
Who are you?

15:47.656 --> 15:49.800
- Oh, this is Ray Kroc. The
multi-mixer fella you spoke to.

15:49.824 --> 15:51.534
- When do you figure
we can expect them?

15:51.660 --> 15:53.328
- Umm, sent them
blue-label air...

15:53.453 --> 15:55.956
- Good-good.
- Hey, wait, wait.

15:56.081 --> 15:57.582
Wait.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.918
Wait a minute. I'm going to
take you out to dinner.

16:00.043 --> 16:01.586
- You're really not my type.

16:01.711 --> 16:03.171
You and your brother.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.090
- What for?

16:05.215 --> 16:07.360
- This is the most remarkable
restaurant I've seen in all my

16:07.384 --> 16:08.760
years in the food
service industry.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.553
And I've seen it all.

16:10.679 --> 16:12.347
I wanna hear your story.

16:15.558 --> 16:17.435
<i>Well, we were young
and hungry.</i>

16:17.560 --> 16:19.640
<i>There wasn't a job to be
had in all of New Hampshire.</i>

16:19.688 --> 16:21.982
<i>So we decided to pack
our bags and head west.</i>

16:22.107 --> 16:24.526
To Hollywood. I wanted to be in
the movie business.

16:24.651 --> 16:25.971
And Dick,
well, he wanted to be...

16:26.069 --> 16:27.654
- Employed.

16:27.779 --> 16:30.216
- So we landed jobs at Columbia Pictures driving trucks.
- Huh.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.992
And after a few years,
we had enough saved

16:32.117 --> 16:33.743
to buy our own
little piece of showbiz.

16:33.868 --> 16:36.079
A beautiful little
movie theater in Glendora.

16:36.204 --> 16:38.331
Which would have been swell.
Except for the timing.

16:38.456 --> 16:40.583
It was September of '29.

16:40.709 --> 16:42.895
One minute we're screening
the <i>Gold Diggers of Broadway,</i>

16:42.919 --> 16:44.963
and next it's,
"Brother can you spare a dime?"

16:45.088 --> 16:46.381
- I couldn't.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.858
- Nobody in town was
making any money,

16:47.882 --> 16:49.467
except for one fella,
Wylie Reid.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.428
<i>Had a hot dog
and root beer stand.</i>

16:51.553 --> 16:53.138
Hey people still
gotta eat, right?

16:53.263 --> 16:55.265
So we decide to open up
our own little stand,

16:55.390 --> 16:57.851
hot dogs and orange juice,
in Arcadia.

16:57.976 --> 17:00.687
<i>And it went okay. I mean we
weren't going gang-busters.</i>

17:00.812 --> 17:02.373
<i>There just weren't
enough people in Arcadia.</i>

17:02.397 --> 17:04.607
Meanwhile, one town over
is San Bernardino

17:04.733 --> 17:07.527
<i>and we want to relocate, but we
got no money for a new stand.</i>

17:07.652 --> 17:09.863
And that's when
my brother here

17:09.988 --> 17:12.741
comes up with one of his
brilliant ideas. Tell him, Dick.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.409
- Well...

17:14.534 --> 17:16.137
- He says, why don't we
move the stand we've got.

17:16.161 --> 17:17.387
Put it on a truck.
Genius, right.

17:17.412 --> 17:19.372
Only there's
one little problem.

17:19.497 --> 17:21.915
<i>On the road between the two</i>
towns, there's an overpass.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.460
And the building won't clear.

17:23.585 --> 17:25.295
Now I figure that's it,
we're done for.

17:25.420 --> 17:29.340
But then Dick says, "Why don't
we saw the building in half?"

17:29.466 --> 17:30.550
- Saw it in half...

17:40.769 --> 17:42.187
- Come on.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.275
<i>- So we've moved the restaurant
we're setting up shop.</i>

17:47.400 --> 17:48.777
But now we want to
do a few tweaks,

17:48.902 --> 17:50.528
because now it's 1940.

17:50.653 --> 17:51.893
And drive-ins are all the rage.

17:51.988 --> 17:53.549
I mean, they are
the hottest thing going,

17:53.573 --> 17:55.213
and I say, "Dick we
gotta get in on this."

17:55.283 --> 17:56.659
And Dick says...
- "Okay".

17:56.785 --> 17:58.953
And two months later
we open for business...

17:59.079 --> 18:00.580
McDonald's Famous Barbecue.

18:00.705 --> 18:02.290
<i>27 item menu.</i>

18:02.415 --> 18:04.535
Uniformed waitresses bring
your food right to the car.

18:04.584 --> 18:07.712
<i>And it goes gang-busters.
We're going great guns.</i>

18:07.837 --> 18:10.632
But then sales
start to level off.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.550
- The drive-in
model as we learned,

18:12.675 --> 18:14.677
- has a few built-in problems.
- Tell me about it.

18:14.803 --> 18:16.679
For starters,
there's the customer issue.

18:16.805 --> 18:18.973
Drive-in's tend to attract,
shall we say,

18:19.099 --> 18:20.892
a less than
desirable clientele.

18:21.017 --> 18:22.727
- Teenagers.
- Hot rodders and hooligans.

18:22.852 --> 18:25.271
Juvenile delinquents
in blue jeans.

18:25.396 --> 18:26.898
And then there's the service.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.751
It takes forever and a day
for your food to arrive.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.711
- And when it finally does...
- It's usually wrong.

18:30.735 --> 18:33.655
- Yeah. The Carhops are too busy
dodging gropes to remember

18:33.780 --> 18:36.032
that you wanted strawberry
phosphate, not cherry.

18:36.157 --> 18:37.677
- Well, that's if
they remember at all.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.160
- And then,
there's the expenses.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.285
The huge payroll.

18:40.370 --> 18:41.871
Due to the large staff required.

18:41.996 --> 18:43.915
Dishes constantly
getting broken or stolen.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.208
- Tremendous overhead.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.835
- So one day,
Dick has a realization.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.378
He sees that
the bulk of our sales

18:48.503 --> 18:49.921
are only in three items.

18:50.046 --> 18:52.215
<i>Hamburgers.
French fries. Soft drinks.</i>

18:52.340 --> 18:54.008
Eighty-seven percent.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.261
- So we say to ourselves
let's focus on what sells.

18:56.386 --> 18:58.388
And that's exactly what we do.

18:58.513 --> 19:00.348
Brisket gone. Tamales gone.

19:00.473 --> 19:03.351
But we don't stop there.
We look at everything.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.454
- What else don't we need?
- Turns out quite a lot.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.105
- Carhops.

19:07.230 --> 19:09.232
<i>Walk up to a window,
get the food yourself.</i>

19:09.357 --> 19:10.775
- Dishes...
- All paper packaging.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.153
- Disposable.
- Cigarette machines, jukeboxes.

19:13.278 --> 19:14.821
<i>- Drive out the riff-raff.</i>

19:14.946 --> 19:16.823
- Creating a family
friendly environment here.

19:16.948 --> 19:19.200
- But that's not enough.
- All right.

19:19.325 --> 19:20.678
See, our whole lives
we'd piggybacked

19:20.702 --> 19:22.036
off other people's ideas.

19:22.162 --> 19:24.330
We wanted something that
wasn't just different.

19:24.455 --> 19:28.459
It had to be better.
It needed to be ours.

19:28.585 --> 19:30.962
And that's what brings us
to the biggest cut of all.

19:31.087 --> 19:32.797
- Which was?

19:32.922 --> 19:35.884
- The wait.
- Orders ready in 30 seconds.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.844
- Not 30 minutes.
Mecca.

19:37.969 --> 19:40.138
- We looked at each other
one night.

19:40.263 --> 19:41.806
- You thinking
what I'm thinking?

19:41.931 --> 19:43.576
- We're going to have to
tear down, rebuild.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.768
Reconfigure.
Rethink the whole dang thing.

19:45.894 --> 19:47.204
- We're talking about
shutting down

19:47.228 --> 19:49.022
a thriving business for months.

19:49.147 --> 19:51.191
- People are going to
think we're crazy.

19:51.316 --> 19:53.651
- We were crazy.

19:53.776 --> 19:55.254
- And you are going to
love how we did it.

19:55.278 --> 19:56.529
Dick, you gotta tell him.

19:56.654 --> 19:57.989
- The tennis court?

19:58.114 --> 19:59.508
- He brings me out to
this tennis court.

19:59.532 --> 20:00.783
And he's drawn this line,

20:00.909 --> 20:02.309
the exact dimensions
of our kitchen.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.579
Sink on the right.
Extruder on the left.

20:04.704 --> 20:05.890
- Extruder.
- Bagging and hood.

20:05.914 --> 20:08.583
- Hood.
- Garnish-garnish.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.752
- This is burger finish.
- Got it.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.504
- And this is burger slide.

20:13.630 --> 20:15.006
We could just move those.

20:15.131 --> 20:17.550
- Okay.
- Multi-mixer, soft drinks.

20:17.675 --> 20:20.136
- We bring out our whole staff
and we have them go through

20:20.261 --> 20:23.097
the motions, making
pretend burgers and fries.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.183
All right, Steve,
anticipate that.

20:25.308 --> 20:27.185
You gotta keep the tray level.

20:28.686 --> 20:30.331
- And Dick is running around
with this stick

20:30.355 --> 20:31.995
<i>marking where all the
equipment should be.</i>

20:32.065 --> 20:34.692
- Tuck in. Tony are you going
to skip the pickles

20:34.817 --> 20:36.110
when we're really doing it?

20:36.236 --> 20:37.987
- They do it over and over,
hashing it out.

20:38.112 --> 20:40.365
Choreographing it like
some crazy burger ballet.

20:40.490 --> 20:41.866
What's going on over there?

20:41.991 --> 20:43.493
- Yes!

20:43.618 --> 20:45.245
No!

20:45.370 --> 20:46.663
No!

20:48.414 --> 20:49.999
Everybody stop! Stop!

20:50.124 --> 20:52.252
Garnish one. Garnish two.

20:52.377 --> 20:55.797
You've got pickles,
you've got onions.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.257
It's a goddamn hamburger.

20:57.382 --> 21:00.385
- Come on, clear off.
- Let's clear off.

21:00.510 --> 21:02.929
It's time for the pink chalk.

21:03.054 --> 21:05.348
And then root beer, orange.

21:07.016 --> 21:08.977
See all this open
space here now?

21:09.102 --> 21:11.771
We've rearranged
the fry situation.

21:11.896 --> 21:15.733
So now it's stage left.
The deep fryer stage right.

21:15.858 --> 21:18.194
Begin! That's great.

21:18.319 --> 21:20.488
- Come on, guys.
- We're pretty tied up here.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.700
- Watch out, it's the
timing of the Lazy-Susan.

21:23.825 --> 21:26.160
Those are finished burgers.
You can't...

21:26.286 --> 21:28.871
Hold it.

21:28.997 --> 21:31.374
I-I still think
there's a third version.

21:31.499 --> 21:33.269
- What do you want to move?
- I want to move everything.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.128
Back to stage left, please.

21:42.051 --> 21:43.761
We got it all drawn.

21:43.886 --> 21:46.180
This is better.

21:46.306 --> 21:47.598
- Is that all right?

21:47.724 --> 21:49.350
I think so.

21:49.475 --> 21:51.769
I guess... I guess... Let's
assume our battle stations.

21:51.894 --> 21:54.522
Okay. Okay.

21:54.647 --> 21:57.859
Finally, after about
six hours of this,

21:57.984 --> 21:59.569
we get it just right.

21:59.694 --> 22:02.447
It's a symphony of efficiency.
Not a wasted motion.

22:14.292 --> 22:15.918
Good form, Jasper.

22:18.421 --> 22:20.173
You feel good
about those pickles!

22:20.298 --> 22:21.549
Ketchup!

22:21.674 --> 22:23.509
Use your Lazy-Susan.

22:25.803 --> 22:27.805
Put your back into it, Seth!

22:27.930 --> 22:32.185
And pickles and
pickle and mustard!

22:32.310 --> 22:33.895
<i>We take the layout to a
builder,</i>

22:34.020 --> 22:36.314
custom build the kitchen
to our exact specs.

22:36.439 --> 22:38.983
- Tada!
The Speedee System is born.

22:39.108 --> 22:41.694
The world's first-ever
system to deliver food fast.

22:41.819 --> 22:43.571
It's totally revolutionary.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.740
- And a complete disaster.
- Why?

22:45.865 --> 22:47.617
<i>Opening day,
cars pull up onto the lot</i>

22:47.742 --> 22:49.053
<i>and they start honking
immediately</i>

22:49.077 --> 22:50.411
<i>because no carhop comes up.</i>

22:50.536 --> 22:52.080
You place your order!

22:52.205 --> 22:53.807
- We try to explain to them
the walk-up window.

22:53.831 --> 22:56.417
And they are bewildered.
Now they're furious.

22:56.542 --> 22:58.145
<i>What do you mean
I gotta get out of my car?</i>

22:58.169 --> 22:59.921
<i>Most of them just cuss
us out and drive off.</i>

23:00.046 --> 23:01.589
<i>And the few that stay
are mad as heck</i>

23:01.714 --> 23:03.174
<i>because they're
eating off paper</i>

23:03.299 --> 23:04.443
<i>and they gotta
discard their own trash.</i>

23:04.467 --> 23:05.885
- Why?
- You're doing great.

23:06.010 --> 23:07.321
Yeah, we won't be
coming out to the car,

23:07.345 --> 23:08.513
but you can come on up.

23:08.638 --> 23:10.348
Welcome to McDonald's!

23:10.473 --> 23:12.368
<i>We may have underestimated
the learning curve.</i>

23:12.392 --> 23:14.752
- So by five o'clock Dick is
calculating how much it's going

23:14.811 --> 23:16.229
to cost to go back to drive-in.

23:16.354 --> 23:17.790
But I am not ready to
throw in the towel.

23:17.814 --> 23:19.732
I go back to our
old Hollywood days,

23:19.857 --> 23:21.943
I think to myself,
we gotta go big with this.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.569
We gotta put on a show.

23:23.694 --> 23:25.631
So I say, "Dick, I wanna
throw a grand re-opening.

23:25.655 --> 23:27.633
A gala premiere that would put
Louis B. Mayer to shame."

23:27.657 --> 23:29.409
So we rent a bunch
of spotlights.

23:29.534 --> 23:31.953
<i>Same ones we used to haul
around in the Columbia days.</i>

23:32.078 --> 23:33.798
<i>We get sparklers,
a juggler for the kiddies.</i>

23:33.871 --> 23:36.791
<i>It is an event,
people show up in droves.</i>

23:36.916 --> 23:38.918
- And then...
- The flies.

23:39.043 --> 23:40.920
<i>They must've been
drawn by all the lights.</i>

23:41.045 --> 23:43.631
Millions of them. It was
like a scene outta <i>Exodus.</i>

23:43.756 --> 23:46.968
The Pharaoh would've
released the Israelites.

23:48.136 --> 23:49.804
<i>Total disaster.</i>

23:49.929 --> 23:51.472
<i>Now it is towel time.</i>

23:51.597 --> 23:53.015
The next day,
Dick and I meet up

23:53.141 --> 23:55.101
to discuss going back to
the old format.

23:55.226 --> 23:58.271
And as we're talking there's a
knock at the service window.

24:02.525 --> 24:03.776
- I tell him we're closed.

24:03.901 --> 24:05.778
- We're closed.
- But he looks so cute.

24:05.903 --> 24:07.822
Hang on. Hang on.
What would you like, Son?

24:07.947 --> 24:09.490
- Can I buy a bag of
burgers from you?

24:09.615 --> 24:11.159
- Three?
- Yes, please.

24:11.284 --> 24:12.964
<i>And I feel bad,
so I fire up the grill</i>

24:13.077 --> 24:15.913
<i>and I make him a batch.</i>

24:16.038 --> 24:17.331
There you are.

24:21.252 --> 24:23.921
<i>As he's walking away from the
service window a car pulls up.</i>

24:28.634 --> 24:30.261
And then another.

24:33.639 --> 24:35.141
Dick?

24:36.267 --> 24:38.060
And then another.

24:45.776 --> 24:48.738
- Hello, welcome to McDonald's.
- Hello there.

24:48.863 --> 24:50.466
<i>Pretty soon there's
a line around the block.</i>

24:50.490 --> 24:52.867
- The word has spread.
- And it's off to the races.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.702
<i>And we are
an overnight sensation</i>

24:54.827 --> 24:56.704
<i>30 years in the making.</i>

25:03.753 --> 25:05.379
So that's our story.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.299
- Franchise!

25:50.424 --> 25:51.759
- Beg your pardon?
- Franchise!

25:51.884 --> 25:53.177
Franchise the damn thing!

25:53.302 --> 25:55.096
It's too damn good
for just one location.

25:55.221 --> 25:56.615
There should be
McDonald's everywhere.

25:56.639 --> 25:58.766
Coast to coast.
Sea to shining sea.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.851
- Mr. Kroc...
- Hey, you know I...

26:00.977 --> 26:04.689
I got a confession I
want to make to you boys.

26:04.814 --> 26:06.107
I'm not out here in California

26:06.232 --> 26:07.376
for any kind of
business meetings.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.776
I came out here for you.

26:08.901 --> 26:11.696
A few days ago,
I got into St. Louis, Missouri.

26:11.821 --> 26:14.699
And I was doing some business,
and I broke out my map.

26:14.824 --> 26:19.161
And I followed my finger
on one single highway west.

26:19.287 --> 26:20.496
Route 66.

26:20.621 --> 26:22.415
- Mr. Kroc...
- And something told me.

26:22.540 --> 26:24.518
Something told me to get into
my car and drive that highway.

26:24.542 --> 26:26.377
And you know where it led me?
Right here.

26:26.502 --> 26:28.004
Right smack dab here.

26:28.129 --> 26:30.298
Right to this
unbelievable establishment.

26:30.423 --> 26:32.925
And when I saw these lines
and your whole operation,

26:33.050 --> 26:36.095
and tasted your product,
I knew what needed to happen.

26:36.220 --> 26:38.180
Franchise. Franchise!

26:38.306 --> 26:42.101
Franchise! Franchise! Franchise!

26:44.437 --> 26:45.855
- We already tried.

26:50.901 --> 26:53.738
Five. Three in Southern
California. One in Sacramento.

26:53.863 --> 26:55.823
And one in Phoenix.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.783
And that's all
there will ever be.

26:57.908 --> 27:00.202
- Why?
- Two-words.

27:00.328 --> 27:01.996
Quality control.

27:02.121 --> 27:05.041
It's almost impossible to
enforce standards from afar.

27:05.166 --> 27:07.126
Places were a mess,
filthy kitchens,

27:07.251 --> 27:08.502
inconsistent menus.

27:08.628 --> 27:10.504
- Sacramento was
selling burritos.

27:10.630 --> 27:12.465
- To watch your
precious creation

27:12.590 --> 27:15.551
be mismanaged like that...

27:15.676 --> 27:18.721
Your name...
- Put Mac in the hospital.

27:20.514 --> 27:22.058
- Well...

27:22.183 --> 27:23.410
So you put somebody in
charge to supervise them.

27:23.434 --> 27:25.811
- We did.
- So what happened?

27:25.936 --> 27:27.813
- He obviously
didn't do a great job.

27:27.938 --> 27:30.650
- So you hire somebody else,
get somebody better.

27:30.775 --> 27:33.194
- Our energies are better spent
making this place

27:33.319 --> 27:34.862
the best it can possibly be.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.548
- It's better to have
one great restaurant

27:36.572 --> 27:38.658
- than fifty mediocre ones.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:38.783 --> 27:40.260
I still think if you
hire the right guy...

27:40.284 --> 27:42.036
- Ray, we're not interested.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.664
- Look, I think you boys are missing
something here that is...

27:44.789 --> 27:47.124
I tell ya,
you got something here.

27:49.502 --> 27:50.753
What is that?

27:50.878 --> 27:53.089
- A concept.
- Huh.

27:53.214 --> 27:54.757
What are those?

27:54.882 --> 27:56.509
It's a way to make
the place stand out

27:56.634 --> 27:58.177
when you're driving by.

27:58.302 --> 28:01.514
- The "Golden Arches",
I call them.

28:01.639 --> 28:04.392
- The Golden Arches.

28:04.517 --> 28:05.893
Who thought of that?

28:06.018 --> 28:09.271
- Oh, that's some pure
Dick magic right there.

28:09.397 --> 28:11.232
- Did you ever
build one like that?

28:11.357 --> 28:13.359
- Just one.

28:13.484 --> 28:15.653
Phoenix.

29:51.415 --> 29:52.583
<i>Ethel!</i>

29:52.708 --> 29:54.126
<i>In here.</i>

29:54.251 --> 29:56.086
- Oh boy, I saw a restaurant,

29:56.212 --> 29:58.506
I've never seen a restaurant
like this in my life.

29:58.631 --> 30:01.759
They've got this
fully automated system.

30:01.884 --> 30:04.220
It's called the Speedee System.
- Mm-hmm.

30:04.345 --> 30:07.765
- Which is a good name for it,
'cause man it is speedy.

30:07.890 --> 30:11.101
I'm telling you it's like
something sprung from the mind

30:11.227 --> 30:13.646
of Henry Ford or something.

30:13.771 --> 30:16.065
- It's revolutionary?
- It's revolutionary.

30:16.190 --> 30:18.442
Exactly what it is,
it's revolutionary.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.967
- And you want to invest in it?
- I don't know. I don't know.

30:21.070 --> 30:23.489
I'm not sure yet. But I just
know I want to be part of it.

30:25.574 --> 30:28.327
- Boy...
- So here we go.

30:28.452 --> 30:30.120
What do you mean by that?

30:30.246 --> 30:32.998
- Wax cups,
Fold-a-Nooks, multi-mixers.

30:33.123 --> 30:34.458
A new idea to chase.

30:34.583 --> 30:36.919
- Those things put a
roof over our heads.

30:37.044 --> 30:38.128
- At least over mine.

30:38.254 --> 30:39.672
- What do you mean over yours?

30:39.797 --> 30:41.507
Over "our" heads.

30:41.632 --> 30:44.885
- It's a good roof, Ray.
It's a good house.

30:45.010 --> 30:48.597
It's a good life, if you
weren't too busy to live it.

30:48.722 --> 30:50.891
We could go to the club,
more than twice a year.

30:51.016 --> 30:53.227
Christ, just take a walk
around the block together.

30:53.352 --> 30:58.023
Isn't it time to enjoy a little
and stop chasing your tail?

30:58.148 --> 31:02.111
When's enough going
to be enough for you?

31:02.236 --> 31:04.321
- Honestly?

31:04.446 --> 31:06.532
Probably never.

31:09.743 --> 31:11.912
Why should I settle
when other men won't?

31:12.037 --> 31:13.414
- I don't know, Ray.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.791
- Maybe if I had a wife
with an ounce of vision.

31:15.916 --> 31:19.044
Showed me an ounce of support.

31:19.169 --> 31:20.880
Sorry. Wrong word.

31:21.005 --> 31:22.464
- I've done nothing
but support you!

31:22.590 --> 31:24.341
- Look, I'm sorry.

31:24.466 --> 31:26.135
- No. Ups, downs.

31:26.260 --> 31:29.555
Dwindling savings, your schemes.
- You're right.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.163
Are you familiar with
the concept of the chicken

33:00.187 --> 33:02.106
and the egg, Mr. Johnson?

33:02.231 --> 33:04.775
Because I think
that's applicable here.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.952
- Hey, Dick.

34:00.330 --> 34:02.416
- What is it with this guy?

34:02.541 --> 34:04.418
- Do it for your country!
- What?

34:07.629 --> 34:09.482
- If you boys don't want to
franchise for yourselves,

34:09.505 --> 34:12.259
that's fine.
Do it for your country.

34:14.261 --> 34:16.513
Do it for America.

34:21.185 --> 34:22.864
You know I've drove
through a lot of towns.

34:22.978 --> 34:24.772
A lot of small towns.

34:24.897 --> 34:27.565
And they all had
two things in common.

34:27.690 --> 34:29.735
They had a courthouse
and they had a church.

34:29.860 --> 34:32.654
On top of the church
you got a cross,

34:32.780 --> 34:35.949
and on top of the courthouse,
they'd have a flag.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.826
Flags, crosses.

34:37.951 --> 34:40.954
Crosses, flags.

34:41.080 --> 34:43.183
Driving around, I just
cannot stop thinking about this

34:43.206 --> 34:45.125
tremendous restaurant.

34:45.250 --> 34:48.462
Now at the risk of
sounding blasphemous,

34:48.587 --> 34:51.715
forgive me, those arches
have a lot in common

34:51.840 --> 34:53.382
with those buildings.

34:53.509 --> 34:55.469
A building with a
cross on top of it.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.055
What is that? It's a gathering
place where decent wholesome

34:58.180 --> 35:01.558
people come together
and they share values

35:01.683 --> 35:04.436
protected by
that American flag.

35:04.561 --> 35:09.775
It could be said that beautiful
building flanked by those arches

35:09.900 --> 35:12.319
signifies more or less
the same thing.

35:12.444 --> 35:16.740
It doesn't just say
delicious hamburgers inside.

35:16.865 --> 35:19.326
They signify family.
It signifies community.

35:19.451 --> 35:22.246
It's a place where American's
come together to break bread.

35:22.371 --> 35:26.166
I am telling you,

35:26.291 --> 35:30.879
McDonald's can be
the new American church.

35:32.714 --> 35:34.466
Feeding bodies and feeding souls

35:34.591 --> 35:38.303
and it ain't just open
on Sundays, boys.

35:38.428 --> 35:40.931
It's open seven-days a week.

35:47.980 --> 35:49.731
Crosses.

35:49.857 --> 35:52.151
Flags.

35:52.276 --> 35:53.819
Arches.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.829
- Give us a minute, Ray.

36:03.954 --> 36:05.706
- Sure.

36:09.251 --> 36:11.211
- I don't know.

36:11.336 --> 36:14.882
- This is your dream,
it's bigger than your dream.

36:15.007 --> 36:19.011
Arches. Your arches.
Coast to coast.

36:19.136 --> 36:21.555
- I can't put you
through that again.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.600
- I know how bad you want this.
And you should have it.

36:24.725 --> 36:26.560
- Your diabetes. Last time...

36:26.685 --> 36:28.746
- We'll do things differently.
Learn from our mistakes.

36:28.770 --> 36:30.355
- How so?

36:30.480 --> 36:32.720
- Keep a tighter leash on
everything. Complete oversight.

36:32.816 --> 36:34.193
Every change goes through us.

36:34.318 --> 36:36.153
- Who says
he's going to listen?

36:36.278 --> 36:38.155
- We'll make him listen.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.781
We'll draw up a contact.

36:39.907 --> 36:42.075
Clear as day,
black and white.

37:03.597 --> 37:04.848
- Fine.

37:08.268 --> 37:09.895
Fine.

37:13.774 --> 37:15.651
Fine.

37:20.072 --> 37:21.740
Fine.

37:40.050 --> 37:42.261
- Let's get to work, boys.
- What's the first step?

37:42.386 --> 37:44.137
- Just leave that to me.

37:44.263 --> 37:46.223
We are a
dynamic-fast growing company.

37:46.348 --> 37:48.725
And we're poised to make
major inroads nationally.

37:48.850 --> 37:51.770
So in addition to giving us a
real strong foothold right here

37:51.895 --> 37:54.898
in the Midwest, the Des Plaines
location would serve as kind of

37:55.023 --> 37:58.527
a lure for other
franchises if you will.

37:58.652 --> 38:00.904
- What are those?

38:01.029 --> 38:03.740
- What are...
- Those?

38:06.952 --> 38:08.912
- Let me see. Oh, those. Yeah.

38:09.037 --> 38:10.998
That's just my little way
of separating us

38:11.123 --> 38:12.916
from the rest of the pack.

38:13.041 --> 38:14.835
You like 'em?

38:14.960 --> 38:16.962
I call them the Golden Arches.

38:17.087 --> 38:20.090
- You look familiar.
Have we met before?

38:20.215 --> 38:21.591
- I don't think so.

38:21.717 --> 38:23.157
I think I would
have remembered that.

38:23.218 --> 38:25.220
Peruse the inside here
if you don't mind.

38:25.345 --> 38:27.806
- Take a look at the, read that.
- Yeah.

38:27.931 --> 38:29.933
- The Fold-a-Nook.

38:30.058 --> 38:32.227
It's like a Murphy Bed,
for your kitchen.

38:32.352 --> 38:33.937
Huh?

38:37.232 --> 38:40.694
- Take a look at the
blueprints we got.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.279
We had those done locally.

38:42.404 --> 38:43.947
- I never forget a face.

38:49.703 --> 38:52.247
- Unique. Original.
Totally innovative.

38:52.372 --> 38:53.790
There's nothing like this.

38:53.915 --> 38:56.585
Nothing in the entire
food service sector.

38:56.710 --> 38:59.838
- Nice brochure,
professionally done.

39:02.174 --> 39:03.550
Have we met?

39:05.093 --> 39:06.845
The paper cup guy.

39:06.970 --> 39:09.973
- Yeah. That was
a long time ago.

39:10.098 --> 39:11.892
That was a long time ago.

39:13.518 --> 39:14.936
What do you think?

39:15.062 --> 39:17.105
- I don't know.

39:19.232 --> 39:20.400
- There's...

39:22.652 --> 39:23.904
Look...

39:25.906 --> 39:27.699
I'm gonna level with ya.

39:30.952 --> 39:33.413
I need this one.

39:33.538 --> 39:34.915
You think, uh...

39:35.040 --> 39:36.309
Is there anything you
can do to help me out?

39:36.333 --> 39:37.876
- I'll tell you what,
let me refer you

39:38.001 --> 39:39.628
to one of my colleagues.

39:39.753 --> 39:43.382
Somebody who may be better
suited to meet your needs.

39:43.507 --> 39:45.133
- Thank you.

39:49.137 --> 39:50.764
- Ray Kroc.

39:51.890 --> 39:52.891
Address...

39:53.016 --> 39:56.520
- 143 Juniper Road,

39:56.645 --> 39:59.272
Arlington Heights, Illinois.

40:00.565 --> 40:01.817
- Home telephone number?

40:03.402 --> 40:05.654
- Ahh, use my office
telephone number,

40:05.779 --> 40:08.323
that's the best
place to reach me.

40:08.448 --> 40:09.908
- All right.

40:10.033 --> 40:11.952
Of course we'll need
an appraisal on your home

40:12.077 --> 40:14.162
before we can issue funds.

40:38.437 --> 40:39.938
- Be right.

40:41.398 --> 40:43.024
Just be right one time.

40:58.248 --> 40:59.916
One time.

41:01.835 --> 41:03.020
<i>June, did you schedule the
stakeout with the engineer?</i>

41:03.044 --> 41:04.212
All set.

41:04.337 --> 41:05.630
- What about the fire
department?

41:05.755 --> 41:06.983
Did you get the approval
for the driveway design?

41:07.007 --> 41:08.508
- Left a message
with them yesterday.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.010
- Excavation permits?

41:10.135 --> 41:11.636
<i>- I'm meeting with them today.</i>

41:11.761 --> 41:13.430
- All right.

41:13.555 --> 41:15.974
Hey, what's going on with
San Bernardino, by the way?

41:16.099 --> 41:20.812
- I just spoke to Dick,
he says they're working on it.

41:20.937 --> 41:22.314
- They're working on it?

41:22.439 --> 41:23.648
- That's what he said.

41:25.567 --> 41:27.903
- Ray Kroc on the line.

41:30.906 --> 41:33.366
- Hiya, Ray.
- Boy, you boys are killing me.

41:33.492 --> 41:34.576
<i>What's the hold up?</i>

41:34.701 --> 41:36.119
I break ground in two weeks.

41:36.244 --> 41:38.246
- These things take time.

41:38.371 --> 41:39.998
You're proposing
substantial alterations.

41:40.123 --> 41:42.667
- I'm adding a basement
and a furnace, that's all.

41:42.792 --> 41:45.462
- We need our architect to
thoroughly review it

41:45.587 --> 41:47.467
and make sure everything
is safe and up to code.

41:47.589 --> 41:50.675
- Fine. Has he seen it yet,
has he taken a look at it?

41:50.800 --> 41:52.344
- I'm not sure to be honest.

41:52.469 --> 41:54.930
- I've got bulldozers
rolling up on the 23rd.

41:55.055 --> 41:57.224
<i>- I'm not the one
who scheduled that, Ray.</i>

41:57.349 --> 41:59.476
- I need you to take a breath.
<i>- Take a breath?</i>

41:59.601 --> 42:02.729
Do you realize what it's going
to cost me if I have to push?

42:02.854 --> 42:04.689
- Hopefully,
it won't come to that.

42:04.814 --> 42:06.525
- Every restaurant
in the Midwest

42:06.650 --> 42:07.984
has a basement and a furnace.

42:08.109 --> 42:09.861
- This is standard stuff.
<i>- I understand.</i>

42:09.986 --> 42:12.030
But it's our name
on that building.

42:12.155 --> 42:15.408
God forbid the floor caves in
and people get hurt or worse

42:15.534 --> 42:17.369
because of some
design flaw we missed.

42:17.494 --> 42:20.497
Let's just slow down a minute
and make sure it's done right.

42:20.622 --> 42:22.582
- So much for the
Speedee System, huh?

42:28.421 --> 42:30.757
- Did he just hang up on you?
- Yes.

42:30.882 --> 42:33.093
Unless we got
violently disconnected.

42:33.218 --> 42:34.844
- Okay.

42:36.638 --> 42:38.056
It'll be fine.

42:40.809 --> 42:43.270
- Where's the...
Where's the front of the apron?

42:43.395 --> 42:45.522
- Show me.
- All right.

42:45.647 --> 42:47.917
Just make sure the windows
are big enough so the customers

42:47.941 --> 42:49.794
can look into the restaurant.
All the way to the kitchen.

42:49.818 --> 42:51.361
Doesn't look right.
Let me see this.

42:51.486 --> 42:52.737
- Ray.
- What?

42:52.862 --> 42:54.406
- We got a letter
from San Bernardino.

42:54.531 --> 42:56.533
- Read it to me.

42:56.658 --> 42:59.411
- Dear Ray. Thank you for your
letter sharing your idea

42:59.536 --> 43:03.039
to strike a deal with Coca-Cola
to sponsor menu boards

43:03.164 --> 43:05.208
at the new
Des Plaines location.

43:05.333 --> 43:07.794
An intriguing notion, indeed.

43:07.919 --> 43:10.589
As you rightly point out, such
an arrangement would provide

43:10.714 --> 43:12.340
a steady source of
revenue to the store

43:12.465 --> 43:14.759
at no additional labor cost.

43:14.884 --> 43:18.471
- However...
- However? However, what?

43:18.597 --> 43:19.931
- However, this is a concept

43:20.056 --> 43:22.017
<i>that goes beyond
our core beliefs.</i>

43:22.142 --> 43:25.895
McDonald's was founded
with the idea of families

43:26.021 --> 43:27.647
and not strict commerce.

43:27.772 --> 43:29.458
- Sons of bitches, they don't
know what the hell...

43:29.482 --> 43:31.359
- And so on and so on...

43:33.737 --> 43:35.363
Here you go, gentlemen.
Back to work.

43:35.488 --> 43:37.032
- Let me explain.

43:37.157 --> 43:39.868
It'll be real small, along
the bottom. Very discreet.

43:39.993 --> 43:41.637
- We're just not
comfortable with the notion

43:41.661 --> 43:44.122
of turning our menu
into an advertisement.

43:44.247 --> 43:46.916
- See it's not an ad,
it's sponsorship.

43:47.042 --> 43:49.085
- It's distasteful.
- It's free money!

43:49.210 --> 43:51.272
- There are plenty of things we
could do to make a quick buck,

43:51.296 --> 43:53.656
- that doesn't mean we should.
<i>- Loads of restaurants do it!</i>

43:53.757 --> 43:55.300
- Well, we don't.
- Why not?

43:55.425 --> 43:57.385
<i>- Cause I have no interest
in indulging</i>

43:57.510 --> 43:58.910
in that sort of
crass commercialism.

43:59.012 --> 44:00.555
It's not McDonald's.

44:00.680 --> 44:02.408
- I didn't realize I was
partnering with a beatnik.

44:02.432 --> 44:04.976
- I'll have you know I'm a
card-carrying Republican.

44:05.101 --> 44:07.979
- Yeah, well you coulda
fooled me.

44:08.104 --> 44:09.814
- He hung up again.

44:09.939 --> 44:13.193
- He's just... He's just a
little excitable, that's all.

44:16.571 --> 44:19.115
- A hot head like that, you
don't know what he's capable of.

44:19.240 --> 44:23.328
- It's all bluster, Dick.
His bark is worse than his bite.

44:23.453 --> 44:24.847
- That's what
Neville Chamberlain said.

44:24.871 --> 44:26.331
- He'll relax.

44:26.456 --> 44:28.583
Give him some time.

44:34.673 --> 44:36.257
- What are you doing? Come on.

44:36.383 --> 44:38.503
There's time to lean,
there's time to clean. Let's go.

44:40.470 --> 44:42.722
Put the hat on straight.

44:45.600 --> 44:46.810
400 degrees, right?

44:46.935 --> 44:48.228
That'a boy, way to work.

44:48.353 --> 44:50.021
Nice.

44:50.146 --> 44:51.856
Hey, hey, hey.
There's one pickle on there.

44:51.981 --> 44:54.043
Two pickles on all the buns.
Two pickles on all of them.

44:54.067 --> 44:57.278
Don't... don't... Look, watch.
Flip 'em like that.

44:57.404 --> 44:58.839
You already turned them over
and press them one time.

44:58.863 --> 45:00.782
And that one's too pink.
All right.

45:02.200 --> 45:03.743
And you...

45:06.162 --> 45:08.331
Get... these...

45:09.958 --> 45:11.334
That's pretty damn good.

45:11.459 --> 45:14.504
- What's your name?
- Fred Turner, sir.

45:14.629 --> 45:17.090
- Nice work. Fred Turner.

45:17.215 --> 45:18.925
Fred Turner.

45:46.619 --> 45:48.788
<i>It's such a
delicate subject</i>

45:48.913 --> 45:50.832
<i>that I... I just don't
know how to say it.</i>

45:50.957 --> 45:54.919
<i>Kind of a...
I don't know how to say it.</i>

45:55.044 --> 45:56.296
<i>Now, look, Mary.</i>

45:56.421 --> 45:58.339
<i>You called me,
you rushed over to gab.</i>

45:58.465 --> 46:00.592
<i>Now, what is it
you want to say?</i>

46:00.717 --> 46:02.010
<i>Well, Jack...</i>

46:04.137 --> 46:05.513
- I'm sorry.

46:06.890 --> 46:08.641
I know I've been
neglecting you.

46:17.233 --> 46:21.196
What do you say tomorrow
we go to supper at the club?

46:27.952 --> 46:29.621
- Really?

46:29.746 --> 46:31.372
- Really.

46:34.250 --> 46:35.850
Well, look what
the cat dragged in.

46:35.919 --> 46:37.128
Hello, everyone.

46:37.253 --> 46:38.838
Hi there. Hi. Hey...
How are ya?

46:38.963 --> 46:40.441
- Evening, stranger.
- Good to see you.

46:40.465 --> 46:43.051
- Linda Ballen was just
there, she adored it.

46:43.176 --> 46:45.887
- This is on the left side
of the 14th fairway.

46:46.012 --> 46:47.472
- No, use your three-wood.

46:47.597 --> 46:49.200
- Hmm, three-wood.
- Hit it clean.

46:49.224 --> 46:50.975
- I hear Acapulco is divine.

46:51.100 --> 46:52.310
- Where do you like, Ethel?

46:52.435 --> 46:54.604
- Umm, Spain.

46:54.729 --> 46:56.648
- Spain?
- Wonderful.

46:56.773 --> 46:58.358
- Wow. How was it?

46:58.483 --> 47:01.069
- Oh no, I mean,
I'm thinking about it.

47:01.194 --> 47:02.529
- Oh, you haven't been.

47:02.654 --> 47:06.199
- Well, we're
dreaming of a trip, right?

47:06.324 --> 47:08.201
- Great, yeah.

47:11.621 --> 47:13.873
- How's your game, Ray?
- Lately?

47:13.998 --> 47:16.125
- Non-existent.
- I'm no Ben Hogan myself.

47:16.251 --> 47:17.669
- No kidding?

47:17.794 --> 47:20.964
- Haha, yeah. I did hit
a hole-in-one of a sort,

47:21.089 --> 47:23.716
recently though.

47:23.842 --> 47:27.720
I came across an really, really
interesting business opportunity.

47:27.846 --> 47:29.222
Really interesting.

47:29.347 --> 47:30.907
You boys are gonna
want a piece of this.

47:30.932 --> 47:32.743
- Here we go again.
- What is it this time, Ray?

47:32.767 --> 47:35.228
- Restaurant.

47:35.353 --> 47:36.980
- New kind of restaurant.
- New how?

47:37.105 --> 47:39.482
Restaurant filled with
milkshakes and Fold-a-Nooks?

47:43.528 --> 47:45.655
- Fold-a-Nooks.

47:47.574 --> 47:50.034
- Ha-ha.
- I'm just joking with you, Ray.

47:50.159 --> 47:52.829
- Hold on, Jack.
You should hear him out.

47:54.497 --> 47:55.707
This one's different.

48:00.086 --> 48:03.923
- Well, do tell us more.

48:04.048 --> 48:05.842
- I will.

48:05.967 --> 48:08.678
This is a thing of beauty.

48:08.803 --> 48:10.346
Fully automated kitchen.

48:10.471 --> 48:12.471
Likes of which I've never seen.
It's revolutionary.

48:12.515 --> 48:14.017
It's called
the Speedee System.

48:14.142 --> 48:15.828
The thing I like about this,
it's franchisable.

48:15.852 --> 48:17.288
The first one is
already up and running.

48:17.312 --> 48:18.563
Come on over and take a look.

48:18.688 --> 48:20.899
Might make you boys
a few dollars.

48:24.110 --> 48:26.112
You don't have to
worry about a thing.

48:26.237 --> 48:27.739
We're in charge of
everything after.

48:27.864 --> 48:29.991
And all these franchises
look exactly the same.

48:30.116 --> 48:32.785
I would have never thought
but younger workers are better.

48:32.911 --> 48:34.621
They're hustling,
they're ambitious.

48:34.746 --> 48:36.456
Easy as pie.

48:36.581 --> 48:38.684
You just pay the franchise fee,
we take care of everything else.

48:38.708 --> 48:40.293
I'll tell you the whole thing.

48:43.296 --> 48:44.714
Close enough, pick it up, Drew.

48:44.839 --> 48:46.466
All right, let's do this.

48:49.427 --> 48:50.678
Got her?

48:50.803 --> 48:52.388
Okay.
You'll be real happy there.

48:56.142 --> 48:57.810
- Congratulations.
- All right.

49:05.777 --> 49:08.029
- Three new franchises
in the last month.

49:08.154 --> 49:10.281
- Well, that's great.

49:10.406 --> 49:11.616
What?

49:11.741 --> 49:14.077
- I don't know.

49:14.202 --> 49:15.536
- What?

49:15.662 --> 49:17.222
- Don't you think maybe,
given our experience,

49:17.246 --> 49:20.416
that this is all happening
a little too quickly?

49:20.541 --> 49:22.085
If they all pop up at once,

49:22.210 --> 49:24.337
how is he going to
maintain standards?

50:18.391 --> 50:20.393
- Son of a bitch.

50:23.146 --> 50:24.397
- Give it a whack, Jack.

50:27.775 --> 50:30.570
- Hey! Look at this.
What is this?

50:30.695 --> 50:32.030
Huh? What is that?

50:32.155 --> 50:33.489
- It appears to be
a hamburger.

50:33.614 --> 50:34.974
- Not a McDonald's
burger it's not.

50:35.033 --> 50:36.409
Look at all that ketchup.

50:36.534 --> 50:37.928
You've got three pickles
on there instead of two.

50:37.952 --> 50:40.038
Look at that.
Look at that, lettuce.

50:40.163 --> 50:41.456
Really, Jack? Lettuce?

50:41.581 --> 50:43.291
- Can we talk about
this another time?

50:43.416 --> 50:45.144
- Look at the patty itself,
that is tragically overcooked.

50:45.168 --> 50:46.502
Tragically!

50:46.627 --> 50:48.105
- I don't know, Ray,
it looks good to me.

50:48.129 --> 50:49.523
- What the hell do you
know about quality?

50:49.547 --> 50:50.899
I was by your
restaurant today too.

50:50.923 --> 50:52.443
- Yeah, what about it?
- What about it?

50:52.467 --> 50:53.944
You got corn on the cob,
you got fried chicken!

50:53.968 --> 50:55.636
- People love fried chicken.
- Do they?

50:55.762 --> 50:57.823
Let them go somewhere where
they serve fried chicken.

50:57.847 --> 50:59.307
And your kitchen is filthy!

50:59.432 --> 51:01.142
What the hell is the
matter with you guys?

51:01.267 --> 51:03.107
- I don't know about you,
Ray, but I'm retired.

51:03.144 --> 51:04.621
- You said this would be a good
place for us to park our money.

51:04.645 --> 51:05.938
- No, no.
- It's an investment!

51:06.064 --> 51:07.291
- If I wanted a job,
I would have applied

51:07.315 --> 51:09.025
for a cook position.

51:09.150 --> 51:11.510
- You couldn't get a job as a
cook in one of my restaurants.

51:11.569 --> 51:12.569
- Hey!

51:12.612 --> 51:13.863
- What's his problem?

51:13.988 --> 51:16.407
- He's a pain in the
ass is what he is.

51:16.532 --> 51:17.992
Right back at ya, Ray.

51:18.117 --> 51:19.786
<i>- Ethel?
- In here.</i>

51:19.911 --> 51:21.746
- Hi.

51:21.871 --> 51:24.165
- Ray, hurry and get changed.
Dinner is called for seven.

51:24.290 --> 51:28.127
- Yeah, we're not going
to the club tonight.

51:28.252 --> 51:30.046
- You canceled our dinner?

51:30.171 --> 51:32.965
- I canceled our membership.

51:33.091 --> 51:34.759
- What?

51:34.884 --> 51:37.553
- Those Roland Green people,
they're not really our kind.

51:37.678 --> 51:39.180
- What are you talking about?

51:39.305 --> 51:43.226
- I've lost interest
hobnobbing with the idle rich.

51:43.351 --> 51:44.811
- The idle rich?

51:44.936 --> 51:47.355
- Yeah, you know their golf,
their Rob Roys.

51:47.480 --> 51:51.025
They're so
complacent and content.

51:51.150 --> 51:53.653
- Ray.
Please tell me you're joking.

51:53.778 --> 51:55.363
These are our friends.

51:55.488 --> 51:58.407
- No, I know. I know.
You know what?

51:58.533 --> 52:01.536
You and I can make
a lot of new friends.

52:01.661 --> 52:03.055
It's all right,
we'll make new friends.

52:03.079 --> 52:06.958
Friends that are
more suitable, for us.

52:07.083 --> 52:08.626
You know?

52:08.751 --> 52:11.087
Don't you think?

52:11.212 --> 52:12.839
You know what?
Give me one second.

52:12.964 --> 52:14.549
The garage is driving me crazy.

52:14.674 --> 52:16.634
Can I just go sweep
it up and clean it up?

52:16.759 --> 52:18.177
And then put a nice dress on,

52:18.302 --> 52:20.096
I'll take you out
for something to eat.

52:30.648 --> 52:34.569
Yeah! Yeah!
This is ridiculous!

52:36.195 --> 52:39.323
Might as well go, you're
not going to get anything!

52:39.448 --> 52:41.492
- Good job, guys!
- Good job!

52:43.327 --> 52:45.037
You look real busy!

52:45.163 --> 52:47.248
Fine, yeah dance, that's
a good dance there, buddy.

52:47.373 --> 52:49.834
Good job, do anything
but make a hamburger.

52:49.959 --> 52:52.086
Cancel! Cancel my order!

52:54.422 --> 52:58.176
- Just take a gander at
this handsome gold inlay.

52:58.301 --> 53:00.028
You're telling me such
spectacular craftsmanship

53:00.052 --> 53:01.637
isn't worth $8.95?

53:01.762 --> 53:03.306
- But I'm not interested.

53:03.431 --> 53:04.932
- You're not interested
in a Bible

53:05.057 --> 53:08.436
sure to be the pride of your
family's home library?

53:08.561 --> 53:12.899
As you no doubt know, June, envy
is one of the seven deadly sins.

53:13.024 --> 53:15.335
And that is what your friends
and neighbors will be guilty of

53:15.359 --> 53:17.653
when they see this leather-bound
beauty on your bookshelf.

53:17.778 --> 53:20.281
- Sir, this is a
private place of business.

53:20.406 --> 53:23.868
I'm afraid I'm going to
have to ask you to leave.

53:23.993 --> 53:25.369
Thank you for your time.

53:27.038 --> 53:29.916
Prince Castle Sales.
Oh, hold on.

53:30.041 --> 53:34.045
Ray. It's Mac.
Do you want to take this?

53:34.170 --> 53:38.132
Ahh yeah, tell him
I'll call him back.

53:38.257 --> 53:40.509
- Hey, hey. Wait a minute.

53:40.635 --> 53:41.969
What's your name?

53:42.094 --> 53:45.139
- Leonard. Leonard Rosenblatt.

53:45.264 --> 53:47.266
- Rosenblatt? Really?

53:48.684 --> 53:51.103
What's a Jew doing
selling Catholic Bibles?

53:51.229 --> 53:52.688
- Making a living.

53:59.820 --> 54:01.781
- I believe in you.

54:29.225 --> 54:32.019
- Tuck that pickle in. These
are ready to spin. Smooth...

54:33.813 --> 54:35.481
275...

54:35.606 --> 54:38.776
No salt for 30 seconds, okay?
Looking good, fellas!

54:38.901 --> 54:40.569
Looking good! Big smiles!

54:40.695 --> 54:42.780
If you've got time to lean,
you've got time to clean!

54:47.702 --> 54:49.328
- It's normally ten and under,

54:49.453 --> 54:51.664
but for you
I'll make an exception.

54:51.789 --> 54:53.958
Haha!

54:54.083 --> 54:56.127
Love it. Nice.

54:59.922 --> 55:01.632
<i>My new franchisees
are great.</i>

55:01.757 --> 55:03.467
<i>He's in the back
working in the kitchen.</i>

55:03.592 --> 55:06.762
<i>She's out front, handing
suckers out to the little kids.</i>

55:06.887 --> 55:09.390
<i>Husband and wife,
side by side.</i>

55:11.017 --> 55:12.518
Like a real team.

55:15.604 --> 55:18.566
It is really something to see.

55:18.691 --> 55:20.568
Wonderful, don't
you think, Ethel?

55:20.693 --> 55:22.778
- I suppose it is, yeah.
- Yeah.

55:23.863 --> 55:25.948
Like teammates.

55:33.164 --> 55:35.249
I made supper
plans for us, Friday.

55:37.793 --> 55:40.171
- I'm guessing you
didn't rejoin Roland Green?

55:40.296 --> 55:43.716
- Well no... no.
Someplace far better.

55:56.270 --> 55:57.772
- B-5!

55:58.939 --> 56:00.274
- So salty.

56:01.442 --> 56:02.943
I love the salt.

56:07.490 --> 56:09.241
- So what do you do, Art?

56:09.367 --> 56:11.053
- Had a little plumbing business
going for a while after getting

56:11.077 --> 56:12.828
out of the service.

56:12.953 --> 56:15.390
Now I sell vacuum cleaners and
give piano lessons on the side.

56:15.414 --> 56:16.791
- Wow.

56:16.916 --> 56:18.751
- Wow.
Busy guy. Good for you.

56:18.876 --> 56:20.920
Vacuums,
plumping, piano lessons.

56:21.045 --> 56:23.005
You're a jack of all trades.

56:23.130 --> 56:25.216
- Yeah, whatever puts
food on the table, right?

56:25.341 --> 56:28.302
- You must be so proud?

56:28.427 --> 56:29.887
- How would you like to do
more than

56:30.012 --> 56:31.347
"put a little food
on the table"?

56:31.472 --> 56:33.307
Bingo!

56:33.432 --> 56:35.726
- She's excited.

56:35.851 --> 56:37.520
- What'd you have in mind?

56:50.157 --> 56:51.325
- Burger up.

56:57.456 --> 57:00.876
- I'm going to give
you three words.

57:01.001 --> 57:03.963
I want you to take those three
words home with you tonight.

57:04.088 --> 57:07.842
McDonald's is family.

57:10.636 --> 57:12.930
Isn't that great?

57:13.055 --> 57:15.766
You know what I
say when I see that?

57:15.891 --> 57:19.770
Family. We're one big family.

57:19.895 --> 57:21.439
Aren't we?

57:21.564 --> 57:23.441
We've got mouths to feed.

57:23.566 --> 57:24.984
That's a family.

57:27.820 --> 57:30.656
I'm looking for a few good men.

57:30.781 --> 57:33.033
And women!
Who aren't afraid of hard work.

57:33.159 --> 57:34.702
Aren't afraid to
roll up their sleeves.

57:34.827 --> 57:37.663
Clich√©, I know, but I'm looking
for scrappers, hustlers.

57:37.788 --> 57:39.141
Guys who are willing to
roll up their sleeves.

57:39.165 --> 57:40.416
People with drive.

57:40.541 --> 57:41.560
They got a little
fire in the belly.

57:41.584 --> 57:43.335
Got a little <i>chutzpah!</i>

57:43.461 --> 57:45.439
I stand right here before you
today and I'm going to offer you

57:45.463 --> 57:46.839
something as precious as gold.

57:46.964 --> 57:48.591
You know what that is?
Anybody?

57:48.716 --> 57:50.593
Anybody? Opportunity!

57:50.718 --> 57:52.845
It's opportunity! Opportunity.

57:52.970 --> 57:54.388
Opportunity to advance.

57:54.513 --> 57:56.807
To move forward.
To move up, to advance.

57:56.932 --> 57:58.476
To succeed.

57:58.601 --> 58:00.728
To win. To step up.
The sky's the limit.

58:00.853 --> 58:02.897
The sky's the limit.
To grab the brass ring!

58:03.022 --> 58:04.624
To give yourself a shot
at the American dream!

58:04.648 --> 58:06.275
Put your arms around
the American dream!

58:06.400 --> 58:08.628
Opportunity... 'Cause I'll tell
you something, at McDonald's...

58:08.652 --> 58:10.404
Just like this
great nation of ours,

58:10.529 --> 58:11.697
some of that elbow grease...

58:11.822 --> 58:13.199
I guarantee if
you've got the guts,

58:13.324 --> 58:14.426
got the gumption,
you've got the desire.

58:14.450 --> 58:16.202
I guarantee ya, you can succeed.

58:16.327 --> 58:18.954
There's gold to be had at the
end of those Golden Arches.

58:19.079 --> 58:21.957
Golden Arches.
Golden Arches.

58:22.082 --> 58:24.877
Now who's with me? Who wants to
jump on that ladder to success?

58:25.002 --> 58:27.046
Become part of the
McDonald's <i>mishpucha.</i>

58:27.171 --> 58:28.422
Now who's with me?

58:28.547 --> 58:29.787
Come on, let me see some hands!

58:29.840 --> 58:31.300
- I'll join!
- Here!

58:31.425 --> 58:34.011
- There you go. Who else?

58:50.611 --> 58:52.071
McDonald's!

58:55.533 --> 58:57.535
Good, Art, good job!

58:57.660 --> 58:59.328
- Thank you, sir.

59:07.127 --> 59:08.921
- The nerve of this guy!

59:09.046 --> 59:10.506
- What?

59:10.631 --> 59:13.133
- Guess what he's calling
his Des Plaines store.

59:13.259 --> 59:15.302
- McDonald's Number one.

59:19.723 --> 59:22.142
- Then... What are we, then?

59:23.894 --> 59:25.896
- Could his head get any bigger?

59:30.401 --> 59:32.361
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we are about to begin</i>

59:32.486 --> 59:35.239
<i>our initial descent into
Minneapolis-St. Paul.</i>

59:51.338 --> 59:52.881
- Mr. Kroc,
welcome to Minneapolis,

59:53.007 --> 59:55.050
wonderful to see ya!
Gimme an M!

59:55.175 --> 59:56.260
- M!

59:56.385 --> 59:57.261
- Give me a C!

59:57.386 --> 59:58.804
- C!

59:58.929 --> 59:59.929
- Gimme a D!

01:00:00.014 --> 01:00:01.307
- D!

01:00:01.432 --> 01:00:03.309
O!

01:00:03.434 --> 01:00:05.185
N!

01:00:08.772 --> 01:00:10.816
McDonald's!

01:00:35.424 --> 01:00:36.592
- Ray, how is it?

01:00:36.717 --> 01:00:38.218
- You can't even top
that in Chicago.

01:00:38.344 --> 01:00:40.054
- Well, we don't
mess around up here.

01:00:40.179 --> 01:00:41.489
- Boy, my compliments
to the chef.

01:00:41.513 --> 01:00:42.513
That's wonderful.

01:00:42.556 --> 01:00:44.266
- I can do you one better.

01:00:44.391 --> 01:00:46.810
- How about the owner?
- Sure, why the hell not.

01:00:46.935 --> 01:00:48.312
- Rollie?

01:00:48.437 --> 01:00:50.272
Rollie.

01:00:51.774 --> 01:00:52.983
- Jimmy, great to see ya.

01:00:53.108 --> 01:00:55.569
- Rollie, how are ya.
- Oh, wonderful.

01:00:55.694 --> 01:00:56.694
- Rollie Smith, Ray Kroc.

01:00:56.779 --> 01:00:58.364
- Hey.
- Real pleasure.

01:00:58.489 --> 01:01:00.133
- Boy, I tell ya, you got
one helluva restaurant here.

01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:01.968
- Well, coming from you
that's quite a compliment.

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:04.703
- My reputation precedes me.

01:01:04.828 --> 01:01:07.289
- I'm a great admirer.
- Well umm... sit down.

01:01:07.414 --> 01:01:10.084
- I don't want to interrupt.
- Have a seat.

01:01:10.209 --> 01:01:12.044
- Well, maybe just a minute.

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:13.480
- This is Fred Turner
my associate.

01:01:13.504 --> 01:01:14.963
- Welcome.

01:01:15.089 --> 01:01:17.132
- Steaks cooked, okay?
- Excellent. Perfect.

01:01:17.257 --> 01:01:18.759
- Our intention is to ahh...

01:01:18.884 --> 01:01:20.636
expand pretty far
beyond the Midwest.

01:01:20.761 --> 01:01:23.597
We're not going to settle here.
We're not gonna...

01:01:23.722 --> 01:01:26.767
We're going to expand
far beyond the Midwest.

01:01:26.892 --> 01:01:29.812
- You've clearly got a warm and
loving home here in Minneapolis.

01:01:29.937 --> 01:01:31.855
- Yeah, so it seems.

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:34.233
- Yeah, this town just can't
get enough of McDonald's.

01:01:34.358 --> 01:01:35.651
- Here you go, sir.

01:01:35.776 --> 01:01:36.961
- Another Canadian Club
for my friend.

01:01:36.985 --> 01:01:37.861
- Yes, sir. Coming right up.

01:01:37.986 --> 01:01:39.405
Thank you.

01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:40.840
In fact, I'd say there's
sufficient enthusiasm

01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:43.158
to support another.

01:01:43.283 --> 01:01:44.410
A second location?

01:01:44.535 --> 01:01:46.036
- You know,
come to think of it,

01:01:46.161 --> 01:01:47.180
I know the perfect person
to own and operate.

01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:48.372
- You don't say?

01:01:48.497 --> 01:01:49.373
- Somebody who knows
what it takes

01:01:49.498 --> 01:01:50.833
to build a great restaurant.

01:01:50.958 --> 01:01:52.598
Someone with more than
20 years experience

01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:54.545
in the food service industry.

01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:56.296
- Who?

01:01:56.422 --> 01:01:58.757
- Me.
- You!

01:01:58.882 --> 01:02:00.759
Oh! That's a shock.

01:02:00.884 --> 01:02:02.511
- He's funny.

01:02:02.636 --> 01:02:04.430
I've got the know-how,
I've got the backers

01:02:04.555 --> 01:02:06.640
and I've got
the perfect location.

01:02:06.765 --> 01:02:09.017
Are you familiar
with Hennepin Avenue?

01:02:09.143 --> 01:02:11.603
That's one of the busiest
commercial arteries

01:02:11.729 --> 01:02:13.397
in the whole Twin-Cities.

01:02:13.522 --> 01:02:15.250
There's a prime site that's
recently become available.

01:02:15.274 --> 01:02:18.068
Full acre on the
corner of Hennepin and...

01:02:18.193 --> 01:02:20.654
- Mr. Kroc?
- Yeah?

01:02:26.577 --> 01:02:28.412
- Would you like to meet her?

01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:32.458
- Yeah. Sure.

01:02:35.002 --> 01:02:37.171
- So Ray, how long are
you here with us for,

01:02:37.296 --> 01:02:38.547
- in the Twin-Cities.
- Huh?

01:02:38.672 --> 01:02:40.007
- How long are you in town?

01:02:40.132 --> 01:02:42.009
- I... Not sure yet.

01:02:42.134 --> 01:02:43.761
- If you gentlemen
could steal a second,

01:02:43.886 --> 01:02:46.597
I would love to personally
give you a tour of this site on

01:02:46.722 --> 01:02:48.202
Hennepin that
Rollie is talking about.

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:49.850
He knows how to pick 'em.

01:02:49.975 --> 01:02:51.870
I mean this place has
enough room for the restaurant,

01:02:51.894 --> 01:02:55.439
the parking, possibly a
playground for the little ones.

01:02:55.564 --> 01:02:57.941
- Ray Kroc meet Joan Smith.

01:02:58.066 --> 01:03:01.195
My wife.

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.363
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

01:03:03.489 --> 01:03:05.741
- Well, join us.
Have a drink with us.

01:03:05.866 --> 01:03:07.117
- I'd love that.

01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:10.871
- How are you guys?
- Good.

01:03:10.996 --> 01:03:12.623
This is Fred Turner...

01:03:12.748 --> 01:03:18.128
Madison, Milwaukee,
Kenosha, Grand Rapids.

01:03:18.253 --> 01:03:20.756
Ahh, we've got the
three in the Chicago area.

01:03:20.881 --> 01:03:22.674
Oh, Jim's here in Minneapolis.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.009
St. Paul.

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:25.719
- Got one in Dayton, Ohio.

01:03:25.844 --> 01:03:27.221
- That's right.

01:03:27.346 --> 01:03:30.849
- You must be
positively dizzy, Mr. Kroc.

01:03:30.974 --> 01:03:32.893
- Please, call me Ray.

01:03:33.018 --> 01:03:34.853
- Ray...

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:36.480
- That's some growth.

01:03:36.605 --> 01:03:38.816
- Yeah.
We're doing good, right Fred?

01:03:38.941 --> 01:03:39.942
- Yes, sir.

01:03:40.067 --> 01:03:41.568
- Yeah, we're doing good.

01:03:41.693 --> 01:03:43.153
- When did you start it?

01:03:45.781 --> 01:03:47.074
- Hmm? Sorry?

01:03:47.199 --> 01:03:48.639
- What year did you
start McDonald's?

01:03:50.244 --> 01:03:52.412
- Year?

01:03:52.538 --> 01:03:54.414
I started it in 1954.

01:03:57.668 --> 01:03:58.794
- Remarkable.

01:03:58.919 --> 01:04:00.379
- Yeah.

01:04:03.048 --> 01:04:05.467
- Well, I should get back.
- Back?

01:04:05.592 --> 01:04:07.761
- To my piano.
- Oh, of course.

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:11.765
- What's your favorite song?

01:04:11.890 --> 01:04:13.600
All-time favorite.

01:04:13.725 --> 01:04:16.687
<i>- Pennies from Heaven.
- Pennies from Heaven.</i>

01:04:19.648 --> 01:04:21.650
- Great gal.
- I know.

01:04:36.456 --> 01:04:38.166
- I sold pianos for a while.

01:04:41.044 --> 01:04:43.547
- ‚ô™ Every time it rains ‚ô™

01:04:43.672 --> 01:04:47.843
‚ô™ It rains
Pennies from heaven ‚ô™

01:04:51.597 --> 01:04:53.473
‚ô™ Don't you know? ‚ô™

01:04:53.599 --> 01:04:58.353
‚ô™ Each cloud contains
Pennies from heaven ‚ô™

01:05:02.274 --> 01:05:05.193
- ‚ô™ You'll find your fortune ‚ô™

01:05:05.319 --> 01:05:09.489
‚ô™ Fallin' all over town ‚ô™

01:05:09.615 --> 01:05:12.492
- Sounds pretty good.

01:05:12.618 --> 01:05:17.289
- ‚ô™ Be sure that
your umbrella ‚ô™

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:20.042
‚ô™ is upside down ‚ô™

01:05:21.376 --> 01:05:26.173
‚ô™ Trade them for a package of ‚ô™

01:05:26.298 --> 01:05:29.426
- ‚ô™ Sunshine and flowers ‚ô™

01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:36.141
‚ô™ If you want the things
You love ‚ô™

01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:40.520
‚ô™ You must have showers ‚ô™

01:05:40.646 --> 01:05:45.484
‚ô™ So when you
Hear it thunder... ‚ô™

01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:48.445
‚ô™ Don't run under a tree ‚ô™

01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:51.365
‚ô™ There'll be
Pennies from heaven ‚ô™

01:05:51.490 --> 01:05:53.742
‚ô™ For you and me ‚ô™

01:05:53.867 --> 01:05:55.369
- Sorry.

01:06:10.425 --> 01:06:11.969
- Oh yes, yes.

01:06:12.094 --> 01:06:14.221
- Will you be expanding
beyond this or is this...?

01:06:14.346 --> 01:06:16.431
- Oh, no doubt.
We'll be everywhere.

01:06:16.556 --> 01:06:18.558
- Very exciting.

01:06:18.684 --> 01:06:20.978
What is on the menu
beyond hamburgers?

01:06:21.103 --> 01:06:23.647
- Well, we've got French fries,
milkshakes and soft drinks.

01:06:25.023 --> 01:06:27.442
<i>- Ray?</i>
- Down here!

01:06:29.945 --> 01:06:32.364
- I think I've got
some people for you.

01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:35.575
I met this young couple.
Very committed.

01:06:35.701 --> 01:06:37.202
They're from Glenview.

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:39.327
High School sweethearts,
married for five years and

01:06:39.413 --> 01:06:41.557
they're looking for a business
they can operate together.

01:06:41.581 --> 01:06:43.000
And they seem very excited.

01:06:43.125 --> 01:06:45.752
- Yeah, forget that.
Everything's changed.

01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:49.423
- You want a drink?
- No... Changed, how?

01:06:49.548 --> 01:06:52.592
Forget the Chicago suburbs.
Think bigger.

01:06:52.718 --> 01:06:55.012
- Bigger?
- I'm not chasing them anymore.

01:06:55.137 --> 01:06:57.848
They're chasing me now.

01:06:57.973 --> 01:06:59.182
- What is...?

01:06:59.307 --> 01:07:00.642
- The trip!
The trip I just took.

01:07:00.767 --> 01:07:03.854
- The trip. How was it?
- Triumphant.

01:07:03.979 --> 01:07:05.856
They rolled out the red carpet.

01:07:05.981 --> 01:07:07.607
They're kissing this ring.

01:07:07.733 --> 01:07:09.693
They're begging for McDonald's.

01:07:09.818 --> 01:07:12.029
Here, have a drink.

01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:17.534
- That's nice.
- Yeah, sure is.

01:07:18.744 --> 01:07:20.412
- I'm sure.

01:07:22.914 --> 01:07:27.502
Well, then all hail
Pope Raymond the First.

01:07:30.422 --> 01:07:31.882
- Damn right.

01:07:34.092 --> 01:07:35.677
God damn right.

01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:42.267
- Ray?
- Yeah?

01:07:42.392 --> 01:07:44.853
- We have a small problem.
- Wait a minute.

01:07:44.978 --> 01:07:46.772
How can we be
almost out of capital?

01:07:46.897 --> 01:07:49.983
Well, your revenue,
the monthly cut of the stores.

01:07:50.108 --> 01:07:51.735
1.4% of net.

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:53.195
- 1.4?
- Yeah.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.989
1.9 minus Dick and Mac's
half-percent.

01:07:59.534 --> 01:08:01.453
- Mr. McDonald,
Ray Kroc's on the line.

01:08:04.456 --> 01:08:05.916
Good to see you.

01:08:08.877 --> 01:08:10.962
- Hiya, Ray.
- I want to renegotiate.

01:08:11.088 --> 01:08:12.172
- Renegotiate what?

01:08:12.297 --> 01:08:13.632
- My deal. My lousy deal.

01:08:13.757 --> 01:08:15.884
1.4 doesn't even
cover my monthly nut,

01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:17.511
let alone drive expansion.

01:08:17.636 --> 01:08:19.220
- Ray, those are the terms.

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:21.115
- It's not good enough.
- It's almost triple our cut.

01:08:21.139 --> 01:08:23.201
- You should be getting more
too then, shouldn't you?

01:08:23.225 --> 01:08:24.600
- We are not greedy men.

01:08:24.725 --> 01:08:26.060
<i>- Greed has nothing to
do with it.</i>

01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:27.562
<i>If I had more
money to work with,</i>

01:08:27.687 --> 01:08:29.332
I could be growing this
thing at twice the pace.

01:08:29.356 --> 01:08:31.084
- We have no beef with the
current rate of expansion.

01:08:31.108 --> 01:08:33.002
- I've got nothing, not one
location in Pennsylvania.

01:08:33.026 --> 01:08:34.861
- Nothing in New York.
- All in good time.

01:08:34.986 --> 01:08:36.988
- Nothing in Texas.
- I have no doubt it will come.

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:39.157
- I'm out here breaking
my neck for you guys.

01:08:39.282 --> 01:08:40.742
- And you're doing
a bang-up job.

01:08:40.867 --> 01:08:42.553
- Well, then I should be doing a
heck of a lot better

01:08:42.577 --> 01:08:44.305
- than just breaking even.
- I don't know what to say.

01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:45.729
- Say you'll renegotiate.
- I can't.

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:47.415
- Can't or won't?

01:08:47.541 --> 01:08:49.792
- Upping your cut it would be
unfair to the franchisees.

01:08:49.917 --> 01:08:52.045
- The franchisees
are doing just fine!

01:08:52.170 --> 01:08:53.880
I'm the one
that's drowning here.

01:08:54.005 --> 01:08:55.590
- You freely and
willingly agreed

01:08:55.715 --> 01:08:57.384
to the terms of
your deal, Ray.

01:08:57.509 --> 01:08:59.719
Nobody put a gun to your head.

01:08:59.845 --> 01:09:01.971
- Four percent?
- No.

01:09:02.096 --> 01:09:03.448
- Three and a half percent?
- Ray...

01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:04.515
- What?
- No!

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.393
- Goddamn it!

01:09:13.066 --> 01:09:14.609
- Dick.

01:09:14.734 --> 01:09:16.444
Is he a pain in the rear?
Yes.

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:18.196
Does he have a few screws loose?
You bet.

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:20.049
But that doesn't mean he's
going to do us any harm.

01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:21.425
- How long are you
going to keep this up, Mac?

01:09:21.448 --> 01:09:22.742
- Keep up what?

01:09:22.868 --> 01:09:24.095
- The whole
"everything is fine" act.

01:09:24.118 --> 01:09:25.319
There's a wolf
in the henhouse.

01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:27.288
We let him in!

01:09:27.413 --> 01:09:29.040
I never should have listened.

01:09:29.166 --> 01:09:31.102
- We have a contract for
just this sort of thing, Dick!

01:09:31.126 --> 01:09:33.837
- I should have trusted my gut.

01:09:33.962 --> 01:09:36.464
- So it's my fault, huh?

01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:38.133
Just like the movie theater?

01:09:38.258 --> 01:09:41.678
Well, I'm sorry I wanted you
to have your dream.

01:10:01.323 --> 01:10:02.908
- Ninety-four dollars.

01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:09.331
- It's unbelievable what
these suckers cost to run.

01:10:11.166 --> 01:10:13.376
My Pop used to own
an ice cream parlor.

01:10:13.501 --> 01:10:16.379
He went belly-up from
the refrigeration costs.

01:10:16.504 --> 01:10:17.923
- Really?

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:34.522
- A man called today.

01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:41.988
Illinois First Federal.

01:10:47.327 --> 01:10:48.453
- Did he say what he wanted?

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:49.621
- Why don't you tell me?

01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:51.289
- What did he want?

01:10:52.874 --> 01:10:54.125
- Ray...

01:10:54.251 --> 01:10:56.253
- What?

01:10:58.213 --> 01:11:01.216
- Did you mortgage our home?

01:11:02.717 --> 01:11:04.970
We could lose everything.

01:11:31.955 --> 01:11:35.959
- I specifically said the office
is the best place to reach me!

01:11:36.084 --> 01:11:37.961
- I tried there, Mr. Kroc.
Numerous times.

01:11:38.086 --> 01:11:40.755
- You have no right to
call me at my home.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:43.300
It is a blatant
invasion of my privacy!

01:11:43.425 --> 01:11:45.319
- With all due respect, sir,
when you're three months behind

01:11:45.343 --> 01:11:47.470
on your payments you don't
get to pick and choose

01:11:47.595 --> 01:11:49.014
where we contact you.

01:12:56.748 --> 01:12:57.916
- Ray?

01:12:58.041 --> 01:12:59.959
- Surprise inspection.

01:13:00.085 --> 01:13:02.420
- What are you doing here?

01:13:04.547 --> 01:13:06.800
- I just came up to see
how things are going?

01:13:11.304 --> 01:13:12.847
- $12,400.

01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:14.408
- That's pretty good
haul for month one.

01:13:14.432 --> 01:13:16.017
- Could be bigger.

01:13:16.142 --> 01:13:17.811
I hate to mix
business with pleasure.

01:13:17.936 --> 01:13:19.896
- I don't.

01:13:20.021 --> 01:13:21.898
- But my expenses.

01:13:22.023 --> 01:13:23.400
- What about them?

01:13:23.525 --> 01:13:24.919
- Well, they're a bit
higher than anticipated.

01:13:24.943 --> 01:13:27.153
One thing in particular,
that dang walk-in.

01:13:27.278 --> 01:13:29.239
That bill is a real whopper.

01:13:29.364 --> 01:13:33.368
- I know, it's a problem,
all that ice cream.

01:13:33.493 --> 01:13:35.370
- I don't want to
overstep my bounds here.

01:13:35.495 --> 01:13:37.330
But, we may have
found a solution.

01:13:37.455 --> 01:13:38.706
Or Joan did, actually.

01:13:41.835 --> 01:13:44.045
- You don't say?

01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:46.756
- What if I told you there was a
way all of your owner-operators

01:13:46.881 --> 01:13:49.300
can save literally hundreds
of dollars a year

01:13:49.426 --> 01:13:51.094
in electrical costs?

01:13:51.219 --> 01:13:53.346
And reduce the time that it
takes to make a milkshake,

01:13:53.471 --> 01:13:55.515
by half.

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:57.350
- I'll bite.

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:09.487
- It's a powdered milkshake.

01:14:11.072 --> 01:14:12.407
Costs a fraction of ice cream

01:14:12.532 --> 01:14:14.367
and there's no refrigeration
necessary.

01:14:14.492 --> 01:14:15.827
- It contains powdered milk.

01:14:15.952 --> 01:14:17.537
Thickening agents
and emulsifiers

01:14:17.662 --> 01:14:19.622
simulate the texture
of ice cream.

01:14:19.747 --> 01:14:21.027
Tastes just like the real thing.

01:14:21.124 --> 01:14:22.750
- It's easy as pie to make.

01:14:22.876 --> 01:14:25.086
You put a packet into
a glass of water and stir it.

01:14:25.211 --> 01:14:26.963
- I know maybe a
tad blasphemous,

01:14:27.088 --> 01:14:28.607
what with your dairy background
and all.

01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:31.759
- Personally, I think
it's a marvelous idea.

01:14:34.846 --> 01:14:37.891
Chocolate or vanilla?

01:14:38.016 --> 01:14:39.559
- Vanilla.

01:15:01.414 --> 01:15:03.249
Good things come
to those who wait.

01:15:27.607 --> 01:15:29.192
What do you think?

01:15:29.317 --> 01:15:31.778
- I think I'm drinking a
delicious vanilla milkshake.

01:15:34.656 --> 01:15:36.157
- May I?

01:15:40.995 --> 01:15:42.539
Mmm...

01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:46.668
I can't resist.

01:15:46.793 --> 01:15:48.461
- So what do you say?

01:15:48.586 --> 01:15:50.397
We try it out at our place
and then if it goes well...

01:15:50.421 --> 01:15:52.924
- You roll it out nationally.

01:15:53.049 --> 01:15:55.718
- I could. Yeah.
Let me think about it.

01:15:58.763 --> 01:16:01.057
- You're the boss.

01:16:09.023 --> 01:16:10.358
- McDonald's.

01:16:10.483 --> 01:16:12.318
<i>I just found a way
to save you, me,</i>

01:16:12.443 --> 01:16:14.505
<i>and all the owner-operators
literally hundreds of dollars</i>

01:16:14.529 --> 01:16:16.823
<i>a year in electrical costs.</i>
- And what would that be?

01:16:16.948 --> 01:16:18.283
<i>- Two words,
powdered milkshake.</i>

01:16:18.408 --> 01:16:19.784
<i>I'm telling you I came across</i>

01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:22.036
a remarkable product called
Inst-A-Mix.

01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:24.247
Like I say, it's a
powdered milkshake.

01:16:24.372 --> 01:16:26.332
It's a fraction of the cost
of ice cream

01:16:26.457 --> 01:16:28.251
and requires no refrigeration.

01:16:28.376 --> 01:16:29.895
- Ray...
<i>- I tell ya, I tried it myself,</i>

01:16:29.919 --> 01:16:31.671
<i>it tastes just like
the real thing.</i>

01:16:31.796 --> 01:16:33.440
It's delicious. Comes in
chocolate, comes in vanilla.

01:16:33.464 --> 01:16:35.091
Me, I'm a vanilla man.

01:16:35.216 --> 01:16:38.595
- Ray, we have no interest in a
milkshake that contains no milk.

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:41.031
Why don't we add sawdust to the
hamburgers while we're at it?

01:16:41.055 --> 01:16:42.307
Frozen French fries!

01:16:42.432 --> 01:16:43.808
<i>- You don't want to
save a bundle?</i>

01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:45.310
- Not like that.

01:16:45.435 --> 01:16:47.079
- We're talking about
the same great taste.

01:16:47.103 --> 01:16:49.022
Same great taste while
boosting the bottom line.

01:16:49.147 --> 01:16:51.190
- It's called a milkshake, Ray!

01:16:51.316 --> 01:16:54.152
Real milk, now and forever!

01:16:54.277 --> 01:16:56.195
- I understand.

01:17:17.759 --> 01:17:20.011
<i>I'm just asking you
to extend my line.</i>

01:17:20.136 --> 01:17:23.097
- Until you build more equity in
your home or pay down the loan,

01:17:23.222 --> 01:17:24.222
there's nothing I can do.

01:17:24.307 --> 01:17:25.516
- My business is booming.

01:17:25.642 --> 01:17:27.143
- Unfortunately,
that's immaterial.

01:17:27.268 --> 01:17:29.354
- Well, I've got 13
locations in nine states.

01:17:29.479 --> 01:17:31.981
- It's a home-equity loan.
- Then give me a business loan.

01:17:32.106 --> 01:17:33.584
- These thirteen locations,
you own them?

01:17:33.608 --> 01:17:35.448
- Me personally?
- It's your business, correct?

01:17:35.526 --> 01:17:38.404
- You own it?
- I'm the head of franchising.

01:17:38.529 --> 01:17:40.698
I'm the one behind this growth.

01:17:40.823 --> 01:17:43.076
Well, that's all well and good,
but you need assets.

01:17:44.827 --> 01:17:46.537
- Have you been to
a McDonald's?

01:17:46.663 --> 01:17:48.724
Because we've got three right
here in the Chicago land area.

01:17:48.748 --> 01:17:50.500
You should come by
and take a look.

01:17:50.625 --> 01:17:52.394
No, I would love to give you a
tour to give you a better sense

01:17:52.418 --> 01:17:54.018
- of what I'm talking about.
- Thank you.

01:17:56.589 --> 01:17:58.508
- Mr. Kroc?

01:17:58.633 --> 01:17:59.967
- Can I help you?

01:18:00.093 --> 01:18:03.763
- No, but perhaps
I can help you.

01:18:03.888 --> 01:18:06.349
Harry Sonneborn,
nice to meet you.

01:18:06.474 --> 01:18:09.435
- No, thanks, we're very happy
with our current supplier.

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:11.938
- I'm not here to
sell you ice cream.

01:18:12.063 --> 01:18:13.481
- What the hell do you want?

01:18:13.606 --> 01:18:15.167
- I caught a bit of your
conversation back there,

01:18:15.191 --> 01:18:16.752
sounds like you're
having financial troubles.

01:18:16.776 --> 01:18:18.295
- Why don't you
mind your own business?

01:18:18.319 --> 01:18:20.039
- I'm a great admirer
of your establishment.

01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:23.157
- Thank you.

01:18:23.282 --> 01:18:24.635
- I eat lunch at your Waukegan
location at least twice a week.

01:18:24.659 --> 01:18:25.993
Always a fantastic crowd.

01:18:26.119 --> 01:18:27.745
- Your point being...

01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:31.165
- Mr. Kroc, if you're not
making money hand over fist,

01:18:31.290 --> 01:18:32.959
something is terribly wrong.

01:18:37.088 --> 01:18:39.549
- June, grab the ledger,
would you?

01:18:39.674 --> 01:18:41.592
Come on in the office, Harry.

01:18:53.187 --> 01:18:54.939
- So to summarize...

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:57.233
you have a
minuscule revenue stream.

01:18:57.358 --> 01:18:59.110
No cash reserves.

01:18:59.235 --> 01:19:01.463
And an albatross of a contract
that requires you to go through

01:19:01.487 --> 01:19:03.072
a slow approval process
to enact changes

01:19:03.197 --> 01:19:04.949
if they're approved at all.

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:07.493
Which they never are.

01:19:07.618 --> 01:19:09.954
- Am I missing anything?
- That about sums it up.

01:19:11.706 --> 01:19:12.707
- Tell me about the land.

01:19:12.832 --> 01:19:14.584
- The... land?

01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:17.587
- The land, the buildings, how
that whole aspect of it works.

01:19:17.712 --> 01:19:19.547
- Oh, pretty simple really.

01:19:19.672 --> 01:19:21.924
Franchisee finds a
piece of land he likes.

01:19:22.049 --> 01:19:24.010
Gets a lease, usually 20 years.

01:19:24.135 --> 01:19:26.596
Takes out a construction loan,

01:19:26.721 --> 01:19:29.390
throws up a building
and off he goes.

01:19:30.767 --> 01:19:32.894
- So the operator
selects the site.

01:19:33.019 --> 01:19:34.812
- Yeah.
- He picks the property?

01:19:34.937 --> 01:19:36.230
- Right.

01:19:36.355 --> 01:19:38.065
- You provide the
training, the system,

01:19:38.191 --> 01:19:42.403
the operational know-how, and
he's responsible for the rest?

01:19:42.528 --> 01:19:44.197
- Is there a problem?
- A big one.

01:19:44.322 --> 01:19:46.908
You don't seem to realize
what business you're in.

01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:51.454
You're not in the
burger business.

01:19:51.579 --> 01:19:55.208
You're in the real
estate business.

01:19:55.333 --> 01:19:59.253
You don't build an empire
off a 1.4 percent cut

01:19:59.378 --> 01:20:02.215
of a 15-cent hamburger.

01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:04.801
You build it by
owning the land

01:20:04.926 --> 01:20:08.137
upon which that burger
is cooked.

01:20:08.262 --> 01:20:11.974
What you ought to be doing is
buying up plots of land then

01:20:12.099 --> 01:20:15.019
turning around and leasing
said plots to franchisees

01:20:15.144 --> 01:20:17.146
who as a condition
of their deal,

01:20:17.271 --> 01:20:21.484
should be permitted to
lease from you and you alone.

01:20:21.609 --> 01:20:23.194
This will provide you
with two things.

01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:25.947
One, a steady,
up-front revenue stream.

01:20:26.072 --> 01:20:28.866
Money flows in before the
first stake is in the ground.

01:20:28.991 --> 01:20:31.828
Two, greater capital
for expansion.

01:20:31.953 --> 01:20:34.664
Which in turn fuels
further land acquisition,

01:20:34.789 --> 01:20:38.709
which in turn fuels further
expansion and so on and so on.

01:20:43.297 --> 01:20:44.340
Land.

01:20:47.218 --> 01:20:51.806
That's where the money is.
And more than that, control.

01:20:51.931 --> 01:20:54.642
Control over the franchisee.

01:20:54.767 --> 01:20:57.144
Fail to uphold
quality standards,

01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:59.772
you cancel their lease.

01:20:59.897 --> 01:21:03.150
Control over Dick and Mac.

01:21:03.276 --> 01:21:06.696
End result, you'll have the
banks and the franchisees

01:21:06.821 --> 01:21:09.198
in the palm of your hand.

01:21:09.323 --> 01:21:12.201
- If I were to do this,
the brothers,

01:21:12.326 --> 01:21:17.832
they'd effectively would be...

01:21:17.957 --> 01:21:19.876
- Yes.

01:21:23.546 --> 01:21:27.717
So, whaddaya say, Ray?

01:21:43.608 --> 01:21:45.568
<i>We'll need backing.
I've arranged meetings</i>

01:21:45.693 --> 01:21:47.945
<i>with investors
and financial institutions.</i>

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:49.447
We're in the center of the town

01:21:49.572 --> 01:21:51.132
which is the only
over-saturated aspect.

01:21:51.157 --> 01:21:53.951
<i>We should do well in
this area because...</i>

01:21:54.076 --> 01:21:55.912
<i>Has anyone here ever
eaten at a McDonald's?</i>

01:21:56.037 --> 01:21:58.289
<i>...Operation growth is
going to enable us to expand.</i>

01:21:58.414 --> 01:22:01.000
<i>Franchise Realty
Corporation how may I...?</i>

01:22:01.125 --> 01:22:02.978
<i>They seem exaggerated
but they're fully supported</i>

01:22:03.002 --> 01:22:04.378
<i>by the numericals.</i>

01:22:04.503 --> 01:22:06.339
In fact, we erred on
the side of caution.

01:22:06.464 --> 01:22:08.716
- He's being conservative.
Mine, based on gut,

01:22:08.841 --> 01:22:10.593
and my gut tells me
those numbers are low.

01:22:10.718 --> 01:22:12.803
<i>McDonald's is
growing quick as a hiccup.</i>

01:22:12.929 --> 01:22:14.263
<i>- I'm Harry Sonneborn
this is...</i>

01:22:14.388 --> 01:22:16.057
<i>Hurry on over
to McDonald's,</i>

01:22:16.182 --> 01:22:19.268
<i>now serving family communities
from coast to coast.</i>

01:22:19.393 --> 01:22:21.103
<i>You're probably
only minutes away</i>

01:22:21.228 --> 01:22:23.856
<i>from America's
favorite restaurant.</i>

01:22:23.981 --> 01:22:27.693
<i>McDonald's fast service is
the perfect answer for parties.</i>

01:22:27.818 --> 01:22:29.362
<i>Birthday lunches!</i>

01:22:29.487 --> 01:22:31.572
<i>And family meals anytime.</i>

01:22:31.697 --> 01:22:34.533
<i>With no fuss or dishes to do.</i>

01:22:34.659 --> 01:22:37.453
<i>It's America's
greatest food value.</i>

01:22:37.578 --> 01:22:39.997
<i>No wonder you see so many
of your neighbors there.</i>

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:43.417
<i>If you want home quality
cooking without the home work,</i>

01:22:43.542 --> 01:22:44.919
<i>try McDonald's.</i>

01:22:45.044 --> 01:22:47.588
<i>Look for the Golden Arches
at McDonald's.</i>

01:22:47.713 --> 01:22:49.882
<i>The closest thing to home.</i>

01:23:00.226 --> 01:23:03.145
- Have you heard of the
Franchise Realty Corporation?

01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:04.981
- What is it?

01:23:05.106 --> 01:23:09.485
- I have no clue, apparently
Ray Kroc is President and CEO.

01:23:13.072 --> 01:23:14.615
- Hiya, Dick, how ya doing?

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:16.551
- Well, if you really want
to know I'm a tad miffed.

01:23:16.575 --> 01:23:17.970
- Why? What seems
to be the problem?

01:23:17.994 --> 01:23:19.829
<i>- Franchise Realty Corporation.</i>

01:23:19.954 --> 01:23:21.539
<i>- What about it?</i>

01:23:21.664 --> 01:23:24.041
- For starters, would you
mind telling me what it is?

01:23:24.166 --> 01:23:25.835
<i>- Oh, nothing really.</i>

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:28.146
Just a little something I
created to help provide leasing

01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:31.465
services, you know, lend
support to our new franchisees.

01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:33.926
- You know full well you can't
do something like that

01:23:34.051 --> 01:23:35.720
without first clearing it.

01:23:38.723 --> 01:23:40.516
- Now, why would I
need to do that?

01:23:40.641 --> 01:23:42.393
- Because as your
deal plainly states,

01:23:42.518 --> 01:23:45.187
any and all changes must
be agreed to in writing.

01:23:45.312 --> 01:23:46.731
<i>- Except it's not a change.</i>

01:23:46.856 --> 01:23:48.691
- Excuse me?

01:23:48.816 --> 01:23:51.318
- It's not a change.
It's a company.

01:23:53.612 --> 01:23:55.197
It's its own separate company.

01:23:55.322 --> 01:23:57.283
Which puts it
outside your purview.

01:23:57.408 --> 01:23:58.868
- Anything relating
to McDonald's

01:23:58.993 --> 01:24:00.870
is within our purview.

01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:05.416
- Let me explain
something to you, Dick.

01:24:05.541 --> 01:24:10.421
You boys have full say over what
goes on inside the restaurants.

01:24:10.546 --> 01:24:14.383
But outside? Above? Below?

01:24:14.508 --> 01:24:17.219
Your authority
stops at the door.

01:24:17.344 --> 01:24:19.055
And at the floor.

01:24:20.431 --> 01:24:22.058
All right?

01:24:30.441 --> 01:24:32.234
- What's he saying?

01:24:32.359 --> 01:24:34.528
- He's buying the land...

01:24:34.653 --> 01:24:36.572
- Our land?

01:24:37.615 --> 01:24:39.158
- ...on the map.

01:24:39.283 --> 01:24:41.911
Make sure to get this,
you wanna get all pins in.

01:24:44.914 --> 01:24:46.999
Make sure you see the pins.

01:24:47.124 --> 01:24:48.417
- Oh that's great. Beautiful.

01:24:48.542 --> 01:24:49.603
- How about one at the desk?

01:24:49.627 --> 01:24:51.337
- Yeah. Do one at the desk.

01:24:54.256 --> 01:24:55.466
...on your throne.

01:24:59.970 --> 01:25:02.890
- Make sure you get
that in focus.

01:25:03.015 --> 01:25:04.725
- Big smile. Good.
Good, good, good.

01:25:09.522 --> 01:25:11.190
- Delivery!

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:15.236
- Where do you want these?

01:25:15.361 --> 01:25:16.654
- Ray!

01:25:18.197 --> 01:25:20.282
- I thought it over.

01:25:20.407 --> 01:25:21.867
Approved.

01:25:24.328 --> 01:25:25.579
- Really?

01:25:25.704 --> 01:25:27.957
- Thank you!
- No, thank you.

01:25:28.082 --> 01:25:31.252
It's a wiz-bang idea and you're
the one who thought of it.

01:25:31.377 --> 01:25:33.796
- Well we're deeply honored to
serve as your test market.

01:25:33.921 --> 01:25:36.507
- The hell with that. I'm going
to roll this out nationally.

01:25:36.632 --> 01:25:40.136
Hey, have you seen
the latest copy of RBM?

01:25:40.261 --> 01:25:41.679
Hot off the press.

01:25:44.473 --> 01:25:46.475
- Oh, Ray, good for you.

01:25:56.110 --> 01:25:57.987
<i>It's about ten miles
south of downtown.</i>

01:25:58.112 --> 01:26:00.006
<i>They're building a
brand-new sports stadium there.</i>

01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:01.740
- Yeah, Bloomington,
I read about it.

01:26:01.866 --> 01:26:03.552
- We're getting a professional
baseball and football team.

01:26:03.576 --> 01:26:05.161
They'll both be playing there.

01:26:05.286 --> 01:26:07.538
- I think I know where
you're headed with this.

01:26:07.663 --> 01:26:10.541
- A 40,000 seat stadium,
just a stone's throw away.

01:26:10.666 --> 01:26:12.418
Imagine the foot traffic.

01:26:12.543 --> 01:26:14.771
- Hungry families looking for
a bite to eat after the game.

01:26:14.795 --> 01:26:16.255
<i>- Or before, whenever.</i>

01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:18.090
- Exactly.

01:26:18.215 --> 01:26:19.466
Yeah.

01:26:21.343 --> 01:26:23.554
You think big,
don't you Joan?

01:26:26.265 --> 01:26:28.434
- Is there any other way to?

01:26:31.145 --> 01:26:33.063
- Well, you'd be surprised.

01:26:35.816 --> 01:26:38.068
A lot of people are
afraid of taking a chance to,

01:26:38.194 --> 01:26:41.155
you know, reach for greatness.

01:26:43.032 --> 01:26:44.950
<i>- That's so sad.</i>

01:26:45.075 --> 01:26:46.785
- Yeah, I agree.

01:26:46.911 --> 01:26:51.165
Ambition,
that's the stuff of life.

01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:53.083
- What is that saying?

01:26:55.419 --> 01:26:57.004
Fortune favors the bold.

01:26:57.129 --> 01:26:58.672
- Absolutely.

01:27:04.094 --> 01:27:05.721
- Just look at you.

01:27:10.142 --> 01:27:12.561
- You calling me bold, Joan?

01:27:12.686 --> 01:27:14.563
- You don't build
a restaurant empire

01:27:14.688 --> 01:27:16.732
acting like a timid
little mouse.

01:27:42.549 --> 01:27:44.301
That's a fast growing area.

01:27:44.426 --> 01:27:47.096
And cheaper, you're talking
fifteen percent less per acre.

01:27:47.221 --> 01:27:49.115
- Yeah, I still think
Houston's a better location.

01:27:49.139 --> 01:27:50.140
- Ray.
- Yeah?

01:27:50.266 --> 01:27:52.226
- Dick's on line one.
- Now...

01:28:01.318 --> 01:28:02.653
- Hiya, Dick.

01:28:02.778 --> 01:28:04.822
- I just received a
very disconcerting call.

01:28:04.947 --> 01:28:06.615
- Oh?

01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:10.160
<i>- From Buddy Jepsen.
Our operator in Sacramento.</i>

01:28:10.286 --> 01:28:11.870
- I'm very aware of
who Buddy Jepsen is.

01:28:11.996 --> 01:28:14.331
- He told me he received
a shipment this morning.

01:28:14.456 --> 01:28:15.541
- Oh, it arrived.

01:28:15.666 --> 01:28:17.459
- You are way out of line, Ray.

01:28:17.584 --> 01:28:18.836
- Gee, I didn't expect that

01:28:18.961 --> 01:28:21.005
to get there until Friday
at the earliest.

01:28:21.130 --> 01:28:22.148
<i>- Do you mind telling me
what you're doing</i>

01:28:22.172 --> 01:28:23.507
<i>shipping four cases</i>

01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:27.845
of Inst-A-Mix to
one of our operators?

01:28:27.970 --> 01:28:31.515
- Look, if you don't want to
make a profit, that's fine.

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:32.850
But don't stop the rest of us.

01:28:32.975 --> 01:28:34.852
- Us?
- Us.

01:28:34.977 --> 01:28:36.729
As in everyone but you.

01:28:36.854 --> 01:28:38.230
- Who did you send them to?

01:28:38.355 --> 01:28:40.607
- Everyone but you.

01:28:40.733 --> 01:28:43.360
- You have no right,
you are to stop this instant.

01:28:43.485 --> 01:28:45.738
<i>Is that clear?</i>

01:28:45.863 --> 01:28:47.031
- Nah.

01:28:47.156 --> 01:28:48.866
- What the hell does that mean!
Nah!

01:28:48.991 --> 01:28:52.077
<i>- You will abide by the
terms of your deal!</i>

01:28:54.163 --> 01:28:56.915
- I am through taking
marching orders from you.

01:28:57.041 --> 01:28:59.460
You and your
endless parade of nos.

01:28:59.585 --> 01:29:01.837
Constantly cowering
in the face of progress.

01:29:01.962 --> 01:29:05.758
- If phony powdered milkshakes
is your idea of progress,

01:29:05.883 --> 01:29:07.634
you have a profound
misunderstanding of what

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:09.678
McDonald's is about!

01:29:09.803 --> 01:29:11.614
- I have a far greater
understanding of McDonald's

01:29:11.638 --> 01:29:12.890
than you two yokels.

01:29:13.015 --> 01:29:16.894
- What? You will do as we say.

01:29:17.019 --> 01:29:18.771
- Nope.

01:29:18.896 --> 01:29:20.731
- You have a contract!

01:29:27.488 --> 01:29:31.283
- You know,
contracts are like hearts.

01:29:31.408 --> 01:29:32.785
They're made to be broken.

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:49.385
- Could you please
pass the salt?

01:29:52.262 --> 01:29:53.597
Thank you.

01:30:06.985 --> 01:30:08.612
- I want a divorce.

01:30:34.888 --> 01:30:37.307
<i>When quietly trying
to settle a divorce,</i>

01:30:37.433 --> 01:30:39.810
<i>the first thing to ask is,
what will she want?</i>

01:30:39.935 --> 01:30:42.187
<i>And is her request
reasonable and equitable,</i>

01:30:42.312 --> 01:30:44.148
in terms of marital property.

01:30:44.273 --> 01:30:45.691
There's a house, a car,

01:30:45.816 --> 01:30:47.776
savings and checking accounts,
insurance.

01:30:47.901 --> 01:30:50.362
- Just give it to her.
House, car, insurance.

01:30:53.115 --> 01:30:54.783
<i>- What about the business?</i>

01:30:57.828 --> 01:30:58.954
- Nope.

01:31:00.539 --> 01:31:03.417
<i>- Ray, you have to
understand, she's...</i>

01:31:06.211 --> 01:31:07.963
- Let me explain
something to you.

01:31:09.923 --> 01:31:11.675
That's never going to happen.

01:31:14.386 --> 01:31:16.680
I would sooner die,

01:31:16.805 --> 01:31:19.933
than give her one share
of stock in McDonald's.

01:31:25.522 --> 01:31:27.065
- It's not so simple.

01:31:27.191 --> 01:31:28.626
The brothers are
your business partners.

01:31:28.650 --> 01:31:30.194
You signed this contract.

01:31:30.319 --> 01:31:32.196
- Make it go away.

01:31:32.321 --> 01:31:34.698
And I don't care
what it takes.

01:31:36.074 --> 01:31:38.494
- It's going to cost you.

01:32:13.195 --> 01:32:14.488
<i>I'm looking at a letterhead</i>

01:32:14.613 --> 01:32:16.240
<i>with the name
McDonald's on it.</i>

01:32:16.365 --> 01:32:18.075
<i>You care to explain?</i>

01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:19.552
- It was confusing,
people didn't even know

01:32:19.576 --> 01:32:21.203
it had anything to do
with McDonald's.

01:32:21.328 --> 01:32:23.872
- What's confusing is you
calling yourself

01:32:23.997 --> 01:32:25.624
the McDonald's Corporation.

01:32:25.749 --> 01:32:27.417
<i>People will think it's the
whole company,</i>

01:32:27.543 --> 01:32:28.961
not just the real estate arm

01:32:29.086 --> 01:32:31.964
which we strongly
suspect is what you hope.

01:32:32.089 --> 01:32:34.716
- You put Dick's Arches
on your letterhead?

01:32:34.841 --> 01:32:37.302
This is not your company, Ray!

01:32:37.427 --> 01:32:39.179
- Mac...
- Do you understand that!

01:32:39.304 --> 01:32:41.139
- Mac, don't get upset.

01:32:41.265 --> 01:32:44.101
- We came up with
the Speedee System, not you!

01:32:44.226 --> 01:32:45.769
<i>Us! What have you
ever come up with!</i>

01:32:45.894 --> 01:32:47.604
Can you name one thing?
You can't!

01:32:47.729 --> 01:32:49.523
And you never have
and you never will.

01:32:49.648 --> 01:32:51.876
Because you are a leech, Ray.
You are a professional leech!

01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:54.695
- You know what I came up
with, Mac? A concept.

01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:57.072
I came up with the
concept of winning.

01:32:57.197 --> 01:32:58.490
- Let me talk to him.

01:32:58.615 --> 01:32:59.992
<i>- While you two boys
were content</i>

01:33:00.117 --> 01:33:01.553
<i>to sit back and be
a couple of also-rans.</i>

01:33:01.577 --> 01:33:03.245
I'm going to take the future.
I wanna win.

01:33:03.370 --> 01:33:06.582
And you don't get there by being
some aw-shucks, nice-guy sap.

01:33:06.707 --> 01:33:08.268
<i>There's no place in
business for people like that.</i>

01:33:08.292 --> 01:33:10.127
Business is war.

01:33:10.252 --> 01:33:12.796
It's dog eat dog,
rat eat rat.

01:33:12.921 --> 01:33:14.506
If my competitor were drowning,

01:33:14.631 --> 01:33:17.926
I'd walk over and I'd put a hose
right in his mouth.

01:33:21.722 --> 01:33:23.223
Can you say the same?

01:33:33.609 --> 01:33:37.821
- I can't, nor would I want to.

01:33:37.946 --> 01:33:40.782
- Hence your single location.

01:33:40.907 --> 01:33:42.427
- We want you out of
this company, Ray!

01:33:42.492 --> 01:33:44.161
<i>- Mac, how do you
propose you do that.</i>

01:33:44.286 --> 01:33:46.079
- We will sue you,
whatever it takes!

01:33:46.204 --> 01:33:48.957
<i>- And you'd probably win.
But you can't afford to sue me.</i>

01:33:49.082 --> 01:33:51.043
I'd bury you in
court costs alone.

01:33:51.168 --> 01:33:53.003
<i>Mac, I'm the President and CEO</i>

01:33:53.128 --> 01:33:56.840
of a major corporation
with land holdings in 17 states.

01:33:56.965 --> 01:33:59.718
<i>You run a burger stand
in the desert.</i>

01:33:59.843 --> 01:34:02.429
I'm national.

01:34:02.554 --> 01:34:04.139
You're fucking local.

01:34:11.104 --> 01:34:14.733
- He's national...

01:34:14.858 --> 01:34:16.985
- Mac!

01:34:21.490 --> 01:34:22.930
- Are you following
your eating plan?

01:34:22.991 --> 01:34:24.368
- Yes.

01:34:24.493 --> 01:34:26.133
- And you're checking
your glucose levels?

01:34:26.203 --> 01:34:28.056
Are you taking your medication
on a consistent basis?

01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:29.414
- Yes.

01:34:29.539 --> 01:34:31.041
- Regular walks,
20 minutes a day.

01:34:31.166 --> 01:34:32.292
- I'm on my feet all day.

01:34:32.417 --> 01:34:34.127
- Any stress?

01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:39.883
- Okay.

01:34:40.008 --> 01:34:43.220
You need to watch that,
it's a big contributing factor.

01:34:43.345 --> 01:34:44.846
So as I said,
your kidney function

01:34:44.971 --> 01:34:46.890
is currently at 50 percent.

01:34:47.015 --> 01:34:50.102
18 months ago, it was 65.

01:34:50.227 --> 01:34:54.648
Any lower, and you're at
serious risk for kidney failure.

01:34:54.773 --> 01:34:56.483
Okay, I'm going to
check on you later.

01:34:59.653 --> 01:35:01.488
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

01:35:10.372 --> 01:35:13.250
William who rode
with Revere?

01:35:13.375 --> 01:35:14.376
- How many letters?

01:35:14.501 --> 01:35:17.087
- Five. Fourth letter, E.

01:35:18.296 --> 01:35:19.673
- Dawes.

01:35:21.299 --> 01:35:22.634
Come in.

01:35:26.388 --> 01:35:28.223
- How ya feelin'?

01:35:30.183 --> 01:35:32.477
That must've been some spill.
I felt it through the phone.

01:35:33.729 --> 01:35:35.522
Here, I brought ya...

01:35:35.647 --> 01:35:37.190
I brought ya some...

01:35:39.359 --> 01:35:40.986
I'll set it right here.

01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:46.533
Dick. There's a card in there.

01:35:50.245 --> 01:35:51.580
Go ahead.

01:35:51.705 --> 01:35:54.541
- That's okay.
- Here. Just...

01:35:54.666 --> 01:35:56.251
I think you'll be happy.

01:36:07.095 --> 01:36:08.555
- What's this?

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:10.557
- What's it look like?

01:36:10.682 --> 01:36:11.975
- A blank check.

01:36:15.604 --> 01:36:17.439
- Then that's ahh...

01:36:17.564 --> 01:36:19.691
that's probably what it is.

01:36:19.816 --> 01:36:21.860
- What are you buying?

01:36:29.326 --> 01:36:31.244
- Okay.

01:36:31.369 --> 01:36:33.872
You get better, you'll be
up on your feet in no time.

01:36:33.997 --> 01:36:37.709
And we'll talk.

01:36:37.834 --> 01:36:39.628
All right. Dick.

01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:13.495
- We will never beat him.

01:37:15.705 --> 01:37:18.208
We will never be rid of him.

01:37:28.301 --> 01:37:30.178
- Dick McDonald on the line.

01:37:41.398 --> 01:37:43.066
- Hello, Dick.

01:37:43.191 --> 01:37:45.068
<i>2. 7 Million.</i>

01:37:45.193 --> 01:37:48.780
<i>It's a million for
each of us after taxes.</i>

01:37:50.532 --> 01:37:54.661
And one percent of the
company's profits in perpetuity.

01:37:56.705 --> 01:37:58.625
- That's outrageous!
That's borderline extortion!

01:37:58.707 --> 01:38:00.208
That's a bunch of bullshit!
Bullshit!

01:38:00.333 --> 01:38:01.751
- I know it seems
like a lot now...

01:38:01.877 --> 01:38:03.312
- Yeah, that seems like
a lot of money anytime.

01:38:03.336 --> 01:38:05.589
- And they want one other thing.
- What?

01:38:05.714 --> 01:38:08.383
- San Bernardino.
- Uh-uh. No way.

01:38:08.508 --> 01:38:11.094
- To give to their longtime
employees as a gift.

01:38:11.219 --> 01:38:13.138
- I need the profits
from San Bernardino

01:38:13.263 --> 01:38:15.348
in order to pay off
the purchase loan.

01:38:15.473 --> 01:38:17.201
- I've spoken at length
about it with their lawyers.

01:38:17.225 --> 01:38:21.354
It's unfortunately,
non-negotiable.

01:38:21.479 --> 01:38:23.875
Our client agrees fully
with your conditions of sale,

01:38:23.899 --> 01:38:25.650
with one exception.

01:38:25.775 --> 01:38:27.962
Your one percent cut of future
corporate earnings will have to

01:38:27.986 --> 01:38:30.155
be carried out on
a handshake basis.

01:38:32.824 --> 01:38:34.576
- It's my investor group.

01:38:34.701 --> 01:38:37.329
The financing is contingent
on leaving that out of the

01:38:37.454 --> 01:38:39.915
contract, and unfortunately,
this deal just doesn't happen,

01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:41.684
it doesn't get financed
unless you leave that

01:38:41.708 --> 01:38:44.085
out of the contract.
Because unfortunately, that's...

01:38:44.210 --> 01:38:46.796
that's a deal breaker for them.

01:38:51.176 --> 01:38:55.805
Look fellas, you'll get
your full royalties. All right?

01:38:59.809 --> 01:39:02.312
You've got my word on that.
Dick, Mac.

01:39:05.315 --> 01:39:07.192
Let's make a deal.

01:39:15.617 --> 01:39:17.369
All right.

01:39:17.494 --> 01:39:19.037
- All right, gentlemen,

01:39:19.162 --> 01:39:20.640
if you would turn to page
four of your contract.

01:39:20.664 --> 01:39:23.333
That's the first set of
signatures to go over.

01:40:09.421 --> 01:40:11.339
- I just have to ask you
one thing.

01:40:11.464 --> 01:40:13.216
Something I've never understood.

01:40:13.341 --> 01:40:14.718
- All right.

01:40:16.177 --> 01:40:18.930
- That day we met,
we gave you the tour.

01:40:19.055 --> 01:40:20.890
- Uh-huh. What about it?

01:40:21.016 --> 01:40:23.393
- We showed you everything.

01:40:23.518 --> 01:40:24.936
The whole system,
all our secrets.

01:40:25.061 --> 01:40:27.230
We were an open book.

01:40:27.355 --> 01:40:28.773
So why didn't you just...

01:40:28.898 --> 01:40:31.234
- Steal it?

01:40:31.359 --> 01:40:33.403
Just grab your ideas, run off,
start my own business

01:40:33.528 --> 01:40:36.031
using all those ideas of yours.
Would have failed.

01:40:36.156 --> 01:40:37.615
- How do you know?

01:40:37.741 --> 01:40:39.385
- Am I the only one who
got the kitchen tour?

01:40:39.409 --> 01:40:42.203
You must've invited
lots of people back there.

01:40:42.328 --> 01:40:43.788
- And?

01:40:43.913 --> 01:40:45.832
- How many of them succeed?

01:40:45.957 --> 01:40:47.500
- Lots of people
started restaurants.

01:40:47.625 --> 01:40:49.085
- As big as McDonald's?

01:40:49.210 --> 01:40:50.587
Of course not.

01:40:50.712 --> 01:40:52.589
No one ever has
and no one ever will.

01:40:52.714 --> 01:40:56.134
Because they all lack
that one thing

01:40:56.259 --> 01:40:57.844
that makes McDonald's special.

01:40:57.969 --> 01:40:59.512
- Which is...?

01:41:01.931 --> 01:41:03.433
- Even you don't know
what it is.

01:41:03.558 --> 01:41:05.226
- Enlighten me.

01:41:06.686 --> 01:41:09.189
- It's not just
the system, Dick.

01:41:09.314 --> 01:41:10.940
It's the name.

01:41:11.066 --> 01:41:14.152
That glorious name, McDonald's.

01:41:14.277 --> 01:41:17.655
It can be anything
you want it to be.

01:41:17.781 --> 01:41:19.574
It's limitless,
it's wide open.

01:41:19.699 --> 01:41:22.202
It sounds...

01:41:22.327 --> 01:41:24.329
...it sounds like...

01:41:24.454 --> 01:41:27.207
it sounds like America.

01:41:27.332 --> 01:41:30.085
As compared to "Kroc". What
a crock. What a load of crock.

01:41:30.210 --> 01:41:32.087
Would you eat a
place named Kroc's?

01:41:32.212 --> 01:41:35.715
Kroc's has that
blunt Slavic sound.

01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:38.635
Kroc's.
But McDonald's, oh boy.

01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:41.096
That's a beauty.

01:41:41.221 --> 01:41:46.601
Yeah, a guy named McDonald.

01:41:46.726 --> 01:41:50.355
He's never going to get
pushed around in life.

01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:52.607
- That's clearly not the case.

01:41:52.732 --> 01:41:54.692
- So, you don't have
a check for

01:41:54.818 --> 01:41:58.071
$1.35 million dollars
in your pocket?

01:42:03.952 --> 01:42:05.954
Bye, Dick.

01:42:06.079 --> 01:42:08.706
- So if you can't
beat 'em, buy 'em.

01:42:11.334 --> 01:42:13.753
- I remember the first time
I saw that name

01:42:13.878 --> 01:42:17.382
stretched across your
stand out there.

01:42:17.507 --> 01:42:19.008
It was love at first sight.

01:42:19.134 --> 01:42:23.847
I knew right then and there,
I had to have it.

01:42:26.641 --> 01:42:29.936
- And now I do.
- You don't "have" it.

01:42:33.314 --> 01:42:34.983
- You sure about that?

01:42:37.652 --> 01:42:39.112
Bye, Dick.

01:42:46.953 --> 01:42:48.633
<i>As per the terms
of your agreement,</i>

01:42:48.705 --> 01:42:50.832
while you are entitled to
maintain ownership of this

01:42:50.957 --> 01:42:53.793
location, you no longer have
the right to call it McDonald's,

01:42:53.918 --> 01:42:57.338
McDonald or any such variation
so as to confuse or infringe

01:42:57.463 --> 01:43:00.550
upon the McDonald's trademark
which is now the exclusive

01:43:00.675 --> 01:43:02.802
intellectual property of
Mr. Raymond A. Kroc.

01:43:02.927 --> 01:43:04.470
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:43:25.408 --> 01:43:26.910
It'll be alright.

01:43:36.628 --> 01:43:39.714
- Now, I know what
you're thinking.

01:43:39.839 --> 01:43:43.092
How the heck does a
52-year-old, over the hill,

01:43:43.218 --> 01:43:46.846
milkshake machine salesman,
build a fast food empire

01:43:46.971 --> 01:43:51.351
with 1600 restaurants, in 50
states, five foreign countries,

01:43:51.476 --> 01:43:54.354
with an annual revenue
of in the neighborhood

01:43:54.479 --> 01:43:56.648
of 700 million dollars?

01:43:58.358 --> 01:44:01.527
One word, persistence.

01:44:06.824 --> 01:44:09.369
<i>Nothing in this world
can take the place</i>

01:44:09.494 --> 01:44:11.537
<i>of good ol' persistence.</i>

01:44:11.663 --> 01:44:13.456
<i>Talent won't...</i>

01:44:13.581 --> 01:44:17.752
<i>Nothing's more common than
unsuccessful men with talent.</i>

01:44:17.877 --> 01:44:19.879
<i>Genius won't.</i>

01:44:20.004 --> 01:44:22.799
Unrecognized genius is
practically a clich√©.

01:44:22.924 --> 01:44:24.342
Education won't...

01:44:24.467 --> 01:44:27.053
Why the world is
full of educated fools.

01:44:27.178 --> 01:44:32.100
<i>Persistence and determination
alone are all powerful.</i>

01:44:49.742 --> 01:44:51.828
- Mr. Kroc? Will Davis.

01:44:51.953 --> 01:44:54.122
- I'd like to do a profile of
you pegged to the opening

01:44:54.247 --> 01:44:55.832
of your hundredth location.

01:44:55.957 --> 01:44:58.209
- Sure. Call my office.

01:44:58.334 --> 01:45:00.003
- Sure thing.

01:45:00.128 --> 01:45:01.587
All right.

01:45:11.848 --> 01:45:14.559
<i>It's these core principles
that enabled me to</i>

01:45:14.684 --> 01:45:17.145
<i>rise to the top of the heap
at a point in life</i>

01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:21.190
<i>when most men would be thinking
about retirement.</i>

01:45:21.316 --> 01:45:23.943
<i>Why, we appear to have that
in common, Governor Reagan.</i>

01:45:24.068 --> 01:45:27.739
Why, you were what, 55
when you started in politics?

01:45:27.864 --> 01:45:30.950
It's why you make me
look like a spring chicken.

01:45:31.075 --> 01:45:33.286
Laugh, laugh, laugh.

01:45:33.411 --> 01:45:37.332
Why look at us, a couple
of Illinois boys made good.

01:45:37.457 --> 01:45:39.375
Only in America.

01:45:41.669 --> 01:45:43.171
Only in America.

01:45:43.296 --> 01:45:45.631
Only in America!

01:45:45.757 --> 01:45:48.384
Now where wa...
now where was I?

01:45:48.509 --> 01:45:52.597
Ah, yes. The beginning.

01:45:52.722 --> 01:45:56.225
The year was 1954,

01:45:56.351 --> 01:45:58.311
the place,

01:45:58.436 --> 01:46:00.813
Des Plaines, Illinois.

01:46:00.938 --> 01:46:02.482
- Car is out front hon.

01:46:02.607 --> 01:46:04.192
- Be right down.

01:46:29.008 --> 01:46:31.511
That's where it all started.

01:46:34.138 --> 01:46:36.557
Right there on Lee Street.

01:46:38.768 --> 01:46:40.603
McDonald's number one.

01:47:11.008 --> 01:47:13.845
<i>It was a typical
English-American word,</i>

01:47:13.970 --> 01:47:15.888
<i>it flowed. McDonald's.</i>

01:47:16.013 --> 01:47:17.432
I liked the sound of it.

01:47:17.557 --> 01:47:21.102
It sounded wholesome
and it sounded genuine.

01:47:21.227 --> 01:47:25.815
You know?
Ahh, I don't like these umm...

01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:28.067
gimmick type names, you know?

01:47:28.192 --> 01:47:29.861
Ahh...

01:47:29.986 --> 01:47:34.031
burger this and burger that
and all that kind of stuff.

01:47:34.157 --> 01:47:37.034
McDonald's, it's got a
nice sounding name.

01:49:19.845 --> 01:49:23.558
<i>Nobody had eight
multi-mixers in one business.</i>

01:49:23.683 --> 01:49:25.601
<i>So I went out there.</i>

01:49:25.726 --> 01:49:27.436
<i>And I was amazed!</i>

01:49:27.562 --> 01:49:29.981
<i>They were serving
hamburgers for fifteen cents.</i>

01:49:30.106 --> 01:49:33.609
<i>French fries for ten cents and
milkshakes for twenty cents.</i>

01:49:33.734 --> 01:49:36.487
<i>And basically that was
the menu, and I said,</i>

01:49:36.612 --> 01:49:37.822
<i>that's for me.</i>

01:49:37.947 --> 01:49:39.657
<i>Now I have ultimatums,
you know.</i>

01:49:39.782 --> 01:49:43.619
<i>...except that I'd like
to be able to say that.</i>

01:49:43.744 --> 01:49:46.956
<i>I bought the agreement back
from them for two million,</i>

01:49:47.081 --> 01:49:49.417
<i>seven hundred thousand dollars.</i>

01:49:49.542 --> 01:49:52.545
<i>I got the name,
the Golden Arches,</i>

01:49:52.670 --> 01:49:57.883
<i>basically it was a matter of me
working longer and harder</i>

01:49:58.009 --> 01:49:59.927
<i>than anybody else.</i>

01:50:00.052 --> 01:50:03.723
<i>I'll take every resource that
I have and I'll put it in</i>

01:50:03.848 --> 01:50:06.267
<i>and I'll go for broke
if I believe in it.</i>

01:50:06.392 --> 01:50:08.811
<i>The only thing I could do
besides play the piano,</i>

01:50:08.936 --> 01:50:11.272
<i>was to talk.
What happened to my talk?</i>

01:50:11.397 --> 01:50:15.985
<i>It's not dog eat dog out there
in that competitive world,</i>

01:50:16.110 --> 01:50:18.529
<i>it gets more like rat eat rat.</i>
