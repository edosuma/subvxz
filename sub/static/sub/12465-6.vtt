WEBVTT

00:04.538 --> 00:07.172
Is it just me

00:07.174 --> 00:10.476
Or is the new kid
in robotics class
driving you crazy?

00:11.579 --> 00:13.779
New kid
coming through!

00:13.781 --> 00:17.716
I recently got moved from
regular science at my school

00:17.718 --> 00:20.185
Up to advanced
high school robotics.

00:20.187 --> 00:21.787
I don't mean to brag,

00:21.789 --> 00:23.522
But if you don't
toot your own horn,

00:23.524 --> 00:24.823
No one else will,

00:24.825 --> 00:28.227
Unless you build
a horn-tooting robot.

00:29.263 --> 00:30.696
- ( gears shift )
- ( horn toots )

00:31.766 --> 00:32.831
Oh, wait,

00:32.833 --> 00:35.334
- I already did.
- ( toots )

00:35.336 --> 00:37.903
Way to crash and burn

00:37.905 --> 00:40.272
On that hydraulics question,
munch.

00:40.274 --> 00:42.541
Which one of us
is in fifth grade?

00:42.543 --> 00:43.942
( scoffs )

00:43.944 --> 00:45.978
I knew the answer.
I was just...

00:45.980 --> 00:47.880
Distracted.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.314
By alex,

00:49.316 --> 00:51.383
( high pitched )
♪ your girlfriend! ♪

00:52.319 --> 00:54.853
I wish she was
my girlfriend.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.955
And by the way,
in high school,

00:56.957 --> 00:59.324
Liking a girl--
not an insult,

00:59.326 --> 01:01.693
Even if you sing-song it.

01:01.695 --> 01:03.629
It is if she doesn't
know you're...

01:03.631 --> 01:05.264
( high pitched )
♪ alive. ♪

01:05.266 --> 01:06.932
Zip it.
Here comes alex.

01:06.934 --> 01:08.767
I could sit around

01:08.769 --> 01:11.086
And calculate vectors
all day.

01:11.087 --> 01:13.404
Of course if i did,
there'd be no time
for algorithms.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.574
And what fun is that?

01:18.646 --> 01:21.280
Hey, do me a favor.

01:21.282 --> 01:22.948
Go up to alex and ask
if she has a partner

01:22.950 --> 01:25.250
For the remote controlled
drone project.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.252
- Why?
- Because

01:27.254 --> 01:28.854
If she's my partner,
she'll be forced

01:28.856 --> 01:30.456
To spend a ton
of time with me

01:30.458 --> 01:33.559
And i can trick her into
accidentally liking me.

01:34.829 --> 01:37.763
No, i meant
why would i help you?

01:37.765 --> 01:39.898
Because i have access

01:39.900 --> 01:41.633
To your bare bottom
baby pictures

01:41.635 --> 01:43.769
And i am not
afraid to use them.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.904
Okay, fine, i'll help.

01:45.906 --> 01:47.339
But for the record,

01:47.341 --> 01:49.308
I have an adorable
little tush.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.945
Ha, well, maybe having
parker around

01:52.947 --> 01:54.713
Wasn't such a bad thing.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.548
He could be
my bomb sniffing puppy

01:56.550 --> 01:59.952
For the minefield
that is high school girls.

01:59.954 --> 02:03.288
Aw, bad news, dude.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.323
She's got a partner.

02:04.325 --> 02:06.859
- Oh, who?
- I'll give you a hint.

02:06.861 --> 02:09.394
He's got two thumbs
and an adorable tush.

02:10.331 --> 02:11.997

Liv has finally found
the movie she wants to do

03:10.391 --> 03:12.624
To follow up
"space werewolves."

03:17.965 --> 03:19.464
( southern accent )
fiddle-dee-dee,

03:19.466 --> 03:22.034
I'm fixin' to play
a southern belle, y'all.

03:24.104 --> 03:27.105
She is a refined,
civilized lady.

03:28.042 --> 03:29.074
Ooh.

03:29.076 --> 03:30.943
Oh, oh, oh.

03:34.915 --> 03:39.885
And that is how
a lady takes a tumble.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.889
- Oh.
- Oh...

03:43.891 --> 03:45.557
What's with
the grandma dress?

03:45.559 --> 03:48.827
Or we could ask her
if she's okay.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.965
Whoo! I am as sturdy
as a peach pit, daddy.

03:52.967 --> 03:54.633
See, she's fine.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.668
Now, what's with
the old lady getup?

03:56.670 --> 03:59.738
She is just getting
into character, joey.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.074
Her manager,
becky bicklehoff,

04:02.076 --> 04:05.444
Is dropping off the script
of "southern hoops."

04:06.747 --> 04:08.113
"southern hoops"
is shooting in chicago.

04:08.115 --> 04:09.481
I mean, that's only
a few hours away.

04:09.483 --> 04:10.482
I wouldn't even
have to move.

04:10.484 --> 04:11.650
I could be here
on the weekends.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.652
- <i> ( doorbell rings )</i>
- oh!

04:13.654 --> 04:15.954
( southern accent )
why, that must be becky now.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.990
Kindly
hush your vocalities
in the parlor.

04:17.992 --> 04:20.125
Oh, um...

04:20.127 --> 04:21.794
- Yeah, if you could just--
- yeah...

04:21.795 --> 04:23.462
- I got it, i got it.
- Just slide to the side.

04:23.464 --> 04:24.730
You're making
me uncomfortable.

04:24.732 --> 04:25.931
- ...Diagonal.
- I got it.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.432
Maybe-- you know what?
I think get-- wait.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.101
- Yeah, whoo.
- Okay.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.836
Careful now.

04:33.474 --> 04:34.539
( both squeal )

04:34.541 --> 04:36.441
There's my little liv-sicle.

04:36.443 --> 04:37.809
( squeals )

04:37.811 --> 04:39.211
( southern accent )
why, miss becky,

04:39.213 --> 04:40.946
It is our privilege

04:40.948 --> 04:42.981
To welcome you
to our humble home.

04:42.983 --> 04:46.051
Look at you in your
folksy wisconsin garb.

04:48.022 --> 04:50.656
Um, wisconsin garb?

04:51.992 --> 04:53.458
No, becky,
i'm wearing a hoop skirt,

04:53.460 --> 04:56.094
Like the southern belles
in "southern hoops."

04:56.096 --> 04:58.964
Liv, there are no
southern belles

04:58.966 --> 05:00.565
In "southern hoops."

05:00.567 --> 05:02.167
( nervous laughter )

05:02.169 --> 05:06.672
Well, butter my behind
and call me a biscuit.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.707
It's about
a basketball team.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.175
Basketball?!

05:10.177 --> 05:11.877
Becky:
<i>Liv, the script</i>

05:11.879 --> 05:13.045
Is great!

05:13.047 --> 05:14.913
It's the true story
of holly bell

05:14.915 --> 05:16.548
The scrappy underdog

05:16.550 --> 05:18.150
Who single-handedly
led her school

05:18.152 --> 05:20.052
To the state championships!

05:20.054 --> 05:21.920
( nervous laughter )

05:21.922 --> 05:24.790
Ha, any chance
that scrappy underdog

05:24.792 --> 05:26.058
Is an actual dog?

05:26.060 --> 05:27.759
'cause liv's gonna have
a better chance

05:27.761 --> 05:29.695
Of pulling that off
than playing basketball.

05:29.697 --> 05:32.164
Now, ain't that
the truth, suga'?

05:40.207 --> 05:42.541
Alex, i'm glad
we're partners.

05:42.543 --> 05:45.043
You make me want
to be a better robot maker.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.945
I'm glad too.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.263
Hm, well,
at least i would be

05:48.264 --> 05:49.580
If i chose to tap
into human emotions,

05:49.583 --> 05:50.582
Which i do not.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.250
Got it.

05:52.252 --> 05:54.252
Full disclosure,
i'm sometimes fueled

05:54.254 --> 05:57.022
By a inner seething
cauldron of rage!

05:58.158 --> 05:59.858
But, you know,
the good kind.

06:00.861 --> 06:03.762
Hello, fellow roboticists.

06:03.764 --> 06:04.996
I thought
you might enjoy

06:04.998 --> 06:06.832
Some pics of your
partner as a baby

06:06.834 --> 06:08.033
During tubby time.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.771
That is an
aesthetically sound tush.

06:14.141 --> 06:17.776
Told you.
I got nothing to hide.

06:17.778 --> 06:20.779
Shall we proceed
with the aerodynamics test?

06:20.781 --> 06:22.214
Oh, and you need to leave.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.648
You lack the appropriate
security clearance.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.018
What a woman!
( chuckles )

06:27.020 --> 06:29.087
I've always wanted
to date a robot.

06:29.089 --> 06:32.991
And alex is the closest thing
i can get in this decade.

06:32.993 --> 06:35.160
Oh, joey.

06:35.162 --> 06:38.063
I found you the perfect suit
at the thrift shop.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.564
Thrift shop?!

06:39.566 --> 06:41.967
Were they all out
of suits at the dump?

06:43.570 --> 06:45.337
Trust me.
It's really nice.

06:45.339 --> 06:48.240
And you'll need it for my
"vice principal swearing in"
ceremony.

06:48.242 --> 06:50.709
They don't do a swearing in
for the vice principal.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.911
They do now...

06:52.913 --> 06:54.613
By order of
the new vice principal.

06:55.716 --> 06:58.016
Yeah, mom,
i don't want to wear

06:58.018 --> 06:59.351
Some dead guy's suit.

06:59.353 --> 07:00.685
Well, i'm sure
he's not too happy

07:00.687 --> 07:01.887
About the arrangement either.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.955
Who knows?

07:03.957 --> 07:06.341
Maybe a sharp new suit

07:06.342 --> 07:08.726
Will give
some extra confidence
to my little stinker.

07:08.729 --> 07:11.029
Well, maybe retiring
"little stinker"

07:11.031 --> 07:12.230
Might boost my confidence.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.667
It's a little damp.

07:15.669 --> 07:18.036
Did they bury him
in this thing?

07:18.038 --> 07:20.105
Remember to do
the calculations in kelvin.

07:21.708 --> 07:22.808
Whoa.

07:22.810 --> 07:25.277
Pulse quickening,
eyes dilated,

07:25.279 --> 07:26.978
( rapid inhale )
shortness of breath.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.881
Either i just
got the flu or...

07:31.151 --> 07:32.350
( nervous giggling )

07:34.021 --> 07:35.387
You look good, joey.

07:35.389 --> 07:38.723
The pleasure's all mine,
alejandra.

07:38.725 --> 07:39.991
( giggles )

07:39.993 --> 07:41.760
Oh, my.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.094
Okay, bye.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.729
I'll see you later.
You know, tomorrow--

07:47.067 --> 07:48.099
( giggling )

07:50.037 --> 07:51.770
Whoa.
( chuckles )

07:51.772 --> 07:53.872
It's got to be the suit.
Give me the dead-guy pants.

07:53.874 --> 07:54.973
Okay.

07:58.345 --> 08:01.246
Ugh! Becky,
"southern hoops"

08:01.248 --> 08:02.747
Is such a great script!

08:02.749 --> 08:05.183
I want to play
this character so badly.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.418
But every actress
in hollywood

08:06.420 --> 08:08.086
Must be like lining up
for this part, right?

08:08.088 --> 08:09.154
They are,

08:09.156 --> 08:10.722
But "southern hoops"
wants you.

08:10.724 --> 08:11.890
All we have to do
is show

08:11.892 --> 08:13.892
The producers you can play!

08:13.894 --> 08:15.660
So awesome basketball stuff...
( clicks tongue )

08:15.662 --> 08:16.695
Go.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.997
Yeah, okay.

08:18.999 --> 08:23.668
There's gonna be some
awesome basketball-y stuff
coming to you.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.403
( mouths )

08:25.405 --> 08:27.372
( breathes deeply )

08:34.147 --> 08:36.248
Oh! Not the face!

08:39.419 --> 08:40.752
What was that?

08:40.754 --> 08:42.954
I told the studio
you could play,

08:42.956 --> 08:44.122
That i'd seen
the trophies.

08:44.124 --> 08:46.191
You led your team
to the state fin...

08:46.193 --> 08:48.860
( trails off, sobs )

08:48.862 --> 08:50.061
It was the other twin,
wasn't it?

08:52.132 --> 08:54.266
Lucky for you,
you have a highly decorated

08:54.268 --> 08:57.002
Basketball coach
at your disposal.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.203
You really think
you can teach her

08:58.205 --> 08:59.871
To play basketball
by tomorrow?

08:59.873 --> 09:01.273
The producers are waiting.

09:01.275 --> 09:04.342
If i can't do it,
no one can do it.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.319
No one can do it.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.257
There's that snowboard movie
shooting in milwaukee.

09:19.259 --> 09:22.294
Anybody can fake that.
I'm calling them.

09:22.296 --> 09:23.995
No, no, no, no, no.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.164
Wait, i really want
to do "southern hoops."

09:26.166 --> 09:28.300
Maddie:
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

09:28.302 --> 09:30.135
Have the injured girl
who literally

09:30.137 --> 09:31.836
Just got back
from physical therapy

09:31.838 --> 09:34.072
Take out the garbage, cool.

09:38.779 --> 09:41.179
Bam! What?
( snickers )

09:43.150 --> 09:45.116
Hey, sis.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.284
( giggles )

09:46.286 --> 09:48.920
Um, so remember

09:48.922 --> 09:51.756
All those times
that you asked me

09:51.758 --> 09:53.258
If you could teach me
to how to play basketball,

09:53.260 --> 09:56.161
Like all those times
that you said that to me?

09:56.163 --> 09:59.331
Yeah, i'm pretty sure
i never said that.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.867
Well, let's pretend
you did, yay.

10:02.869 --> 10:05.270
( laughs )
liv, why do you want
to learn how

10:05.272 --> 10:06.938
To play basketball
all of a sudden?

10:06.940 --> 10:09.007
Because, maddie,
they're making

10:09.009 --> 10:10.475
This really incredible film.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.077
It's the real-life story
about a girl

10:12.079 --> 10:13.044
Named holly bell.

10:13.046 --> 10:15.080
( gasping )

10:16.083 --> 10:18.350
They're making
the holly bell story
into a movie?

10:18.352 --> 10:20.051
<i>The </i> holly bell?!

10:20.053 --> 10:22.153
Like the one
who won mvp

10:22.155 --> 10:24.322
While also teaching
her mother how to read--
holly bell?

10:24.324 --> 10:27.025
( gasps )
i love holly bell.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.226
I want to be holly bell.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.362
If you play holly bell,
that would be like---

10:30.364 --> 10:32.063
Like i'm holly bell.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.834
Yeah, well,
i can't be holly bell

10:35.836 --> 10:37.302
Unless i can play
basketball, so..

10:37.304 --> 10:38.436
Well, then you
have to let me

10:38.438 --> 10:39.304
Teach you how
to play basketball.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.472
Ugh, fine,

10:40.474 --> 10:42.307
I guess we'll do
whatever you want.

10:47.214 --> 10:51.182
I can't wait to show everyone
our awesome drone.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.118
I wrote a program
that allows it

10:53.120 --> 10:55.053
To drop a cherry on
a hot fudge sundae

10:55.055 --> 10:57.122
From 10,000 feet.

10:57.124 --> 11:00.191
A cherry dropped
from 10,000 feet
would reach a velocity

11:00.193 --> 11:02.560
Powerful enough
to shatter a human skull.

11:02.562 --> 11:04.262
Awesome!

11:06.133 --> 11:09.200
<i>( funky music plays )</i>

11:49.376 --> 11:51.109
- Joey, i--
- shh, shh, shh.

11:51.111 --> 11:53.511
Let the electricity crackle.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.615
Take a picture, kid,
it'll last longer.

11:59.119 --> 12:02.220
I am not saying
that this suit is magic,

12:02.222 --> 12:04.456
But i am saying
that it makes me feel

12:04.458 --> 12:07.959
Like a more funk-tacular
version of myself.

12:07.961 --> 12:10.428
It is definitely magic!

12:10.430 --> 12:13.898
( nervous laughs )
hey, joey.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.633
Um, wow is my mouth dry.

12:15.635 --> 12:16.935
( sighs )

12:16.937 --> 12:19.104
Hydrate your bad self.

12:19.106 --> 12:22.173
Seriously!
Who is this guy?

12:22.175 --> 12:25.176
Seriously!
Who am i?

12:25.178 --> 12:27.212
So, um, do you want to,

12:27.214 --> 12:30.115
Like, team up for
the r.C. Drone project?

12:30.117 --> 12:32.584
What?  I thought
we were partners!

12:32.586 --> 12:36.020
Sounds like the lady's
done babysitting, pal.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.957
Here's the cab fare
back to grade school.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.159
Beat it.

12:42.162 --> 12:43.094
See you in class,

12:43.096 --> 12:44.929
Foxy genius!

12:44.931 --> 12:47.132
<i>( funky music resumes )</i>

12:48.068 --> 12:49.968
That "cab fare"

12:49.970 --> 12:51.469
Wasn't even cash.

12:51.471 --> 12:54.272
It was
a frozen yoghurt coupon!

12:54.274 --> 12:57.008
Joey and that suit
are going down.

12:57.010 --> 12:59.377
Right after i finish this.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.615
I never thought that
i would utter these words,

13:03.617 --> 13:06.050
But why exactly are
we in a shoe store

13:06.052 --> 13:08.486
And not on
a basketball court?

13:08.488 --> 13:12.223
Liv, you are not gonna
master basketball in a day.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.292
So we need
to turn basketball

13:14.294 --> 13:17.061
Into something that you
have already mastered.

13:17.063 --> 13:19.197
Liv doesn't get this,

13:19.199 --> 13:21.399
But she speaks fluent...

13:21.401 --> 13:23.334
This.

13:23.336 --> 13:24.402
( whistles )

13:25.372 --> 13:28.173
Oh, no!

13:28.175 --> 13:30.108
I love these shoes,

13:30.110 --> 13:32.110
But... ( snaps )
i forgot my wallet.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.678
- ( gasps )
- i don't want anyone
to get these.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.313
What to do?

13:39.419 --> 13:41.452
Ha, now no one
will see them

13:41.454 --> 13:43.121
Until you get back
with your wallet.

13:43.123 --> 13:44.656
I call it
the stash and dash.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.391
<i>( liv laughs )</i>

13:46.393 --> 13:48.526
Why are we high-fiving?

13:48.528 --> 13:51.062
That was
a perfect jumper.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.664
Oh, no.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.265
Willow,
a jumper is a dress.

13:55.535 --> 13:58.336
Those were sandals
and they were far
from perfect.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.737
( laughs, snorts )

13:59.739 --> 14:01.739
No, she means a jump shot.

14:01.741 --> 14:04.142
And, seriously,
your form...

14:04.144 --> 14:05.143
Perfect.

14:06.313 --> 14:08.379
- Oh, i did basketball!
- Yes!

14:08.381 --> 14:10.481
You sure did, hollywood.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.150
You guys are
miracle workers.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.659
- ( laughs )
- oh, i'm feeling this!

14:21.661 --> 14:24.062
Okay, hand me another ball,
size 7 1/2 with a low heel.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.330
<i>Come on.</i>

14:25.332 --> 14:26.497

- Yeah.

- What?

14:28.568 --> 14:30.101
- Let's go, rooney! Come on!
- What?!

14:30.103 --> 14:31.102
Show me what you got,
rooney!

14:31.104 --> 14:32.770
I got you, huh? What?

14:32.772 --> 14:33.805
Yes! Yes.

14:33.807 --> 14:35.206
Whoo! Ha!

14:37.477 --> 14:38.810
That was a steal.

14:38.812 --> 14:40.211
Oh, no, honey.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.080
Last season's style
at full retail price

14:42.082 --> 14:43.147
Is hardly a steal.

14:43.149 --> 14:45.516
( sighs )

14:45.518 --> 14:47.151
Oh, you mean
a basketball steal!

14:47.153 --> 14:48.720
- Yes.
- ( gasps )

14:48.721 --> 14:50.288
- ( laughs )
- oh, i'm getting this.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.523
Oh, quick, willow
is stealing the last pair

14:52.525 --> 14:54.158
Of tolentinos from
the door-buster rack.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.260
- What are you gonna do?
- ( gasps )

14:55.262 --> 14:56.661
( both mock gasps )

14:56.663 --> 14:58.062
- Where're you gonna go?
- I'm gonna take it.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.197
- Huh? Huh? Huh?
- It's gonna be mine.

Not in my house!

- Bam!
- Uh, uh, uh.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.570
That is still mine.

Probably.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.762
But that was amazing.

your face on my face.

For the confetti for
my swearing in ceremony,

16:18.411 --> 16:19.577
Instead of school colors

16:19.579 --> 16:21.446
Should we go with
red, white, and blue?

16:21.448 --> 16:24.215
I don't know.
Are you vice principal

16:24.217 --> 16:25.683

to move away from home.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.198
Well, about that.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.667
They aren't filming
in chicago anymore.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.570
They're filming
in r-r-r-omania.

have to move away
from home again,

of a lifetime.

Hug it out?

17:31.484 --> 17:33.651
Not too hard.

Don't want to
wrinkle the suit.

17:35.989 --> 17:37.755
Joey's forgetting two things.

One, i'm smart enough
to be in high school robotics.

17:41.227 --> 17:44.262
And two, he's dumb enough
to hang his suit

17:44.264 --> 17:45.797
Where i can get it.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.302
I'm glad you learned
your lesson.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.638
Now, i'm gonna
go find my lady.

Drink it in.

You wear cat underwear?

It's like you see
right into my soul.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.968
No, i just see
your underwear.

18:56.970 --> 18:58.703
What?

And so does the rest
of the school!

something today.

doesn't come from a suit.

Hi.
So, um...

20:12.011 --> 20:14.512
So going away
to romania

20:14.514 --> 20:17.715
Is a much bigger deal
than going to chicago

you should stay.

opportunity for liv.

Honey, you got
to follow your dreams.

20:34.968 --> 20:36.734
We're gonna be okay.

20:36.736 --> 20:37.969
We'll be okay.

20:37.971 --> 20:39.437
Yeah.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.839
Liv, i think that if...

20:41.841 --> 20:43.941
This is something
that you want,

20:43.943 --> 20:46.577
You need to do this.

20:47.981 --> 20:50.047
And, yeah,
i'm gonna miss you,

20:50.049 --> 20:51.849
A lot.
( emotional laugh )

20:51.851 --> 20:54.485
But we've dealt with being
away from each other before.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.721

20:56.723 --> 20:59.023
This is a chance
of a lifetime for you.

20:59.025 --> 21:02.126
I don't think
you can pass this up.

21:02.128 --> 21:04.762
Yeah,
you're right, maddie.

21:04.764 --> 21:08.132
This is the chance
of a lifetime.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.670
This is my chance

21:12.672 --> 21:14.739

with my twin sister

21:14.741 --> 21:15.206

21:18.978 --> 21:20.978
I came home to
wisconsin for a reason

21:20.980 --> 21:22.747
