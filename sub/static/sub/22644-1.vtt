03:41.773 --> 03:45.641
Mr. Hart, everyone's still waiting
for you in the conference room...

03:45.721 --> 03:47.950
...when you get around to it.

03:48.030 --> 03:49.555
Coming.

04:35.077 --> 04:37.137
You smell like perfume.

04:39.081 --> 04:40.870
Go back to sleep.

04:40.950 --> 04:43.575
I wasn't asleep. Can we talk?

04:44.753 --> 04:47.246
Sure. What do you want to talk about?

04:48.990 --> 04:50.849
Is that my belt?

04:51.827 --> 04:54.286
I wanted to go to that painting retreat.

04:56.055 --> 04:57.822
God.

04:57.963 --> 05:01.591
- This is not a good time.
- It's never a good time.

05:05.640 --> 05:10.800
I told you there is no way
that you can go to a retreat right now.

05:10.880 --> 05:14.423
Who would take care of the kids?
It's two weeks.

05:14.883 --> 05:18.608
Painting is what I've always wanted to do...

05:18.688 --> 05:22.362
- ...and I'm scared that if I don't do it...
- Jill, come on.

05:22.844 --> 05:24.649
We need you here.

05:35.203 --> 05:38.660
Is everything okay at work?
I saw something on the news.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.500
Yeah, it's fine. We just...

05:42.811 --> 05:45.104
...don't believe everything that you hear.

06:59.988 --> 07:01.580
Mom.

07:03.058 --> 07:04.616
Mom!

07:05.393 --> 07:06.862
Mom!

07:08.396 --> 07:09.955
Mom.

07:11.867 --> 07:15.294
I had an accident in Tiffany's bed.

07:28.516 --> 07:32.177
- What are you looking at?
- I thought I saw that dog again.

07:44.599 --> 07:47.723
Max, you're done with soccer at 3:00.
I have to pick up Cindy from ballet at 3:30...

07:47.803 --> 07:50.498
...so please make sure you're on the
corner right on time. Not at your locker...

07:50.578 --> 07:52.228
Dad's here for breakfast.

07:52.308 --> 07:53.930
- Time to go.
- It's only 7:40.

07:54.010 --> 07:55.832
Let's go now.

07:56.112 --> 07:58.170
Good mornin'!

08:02.884 --> 08:05.907
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, Tiff. Love you.

08:05.987 --> 08:07.743
- Love you, Cind. Have a good day.
- Love you too, Daddy.

08:07.823 --> 08:09.053
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

08:09.133 --> 08:10.747
- I love you.
- Alright.

08:10.827 --> 08:13.718
- Have a good day at work.
- You know it!

08:17.983 --> 08:20.276
Are you gonna be home for dinner?

08:21.503 --> 08:23.626
- I will do my best.
- I'm so tired, Bill.

08:23.706 --> 08:27.429
You don't understand how
difficult it is to keep it together.

08:27.509 --> 08:29.999
- Okay, okay, stop.
- I don't know if I can keep it together.

08:30.079 --> 08:33.302
Hey, good night's sleep. Okay?
Will you let me get you some pills.

08:33.381 --> 08:36.005
You just need some sleep. You haven't
had a good night's sleep in a while.

08:36.085 --> 08:38.741
Let you let me get you some pills
that will help you sleep at night finally?

08:38.821 --> 08:42.866
- I'm terrified I'm gonna do something.
- Mom, can we go in this century, please?

08:51.299 --> 08:54.846
Guys, guys, come on.
Don't worry about my mom.

08:55.971 --> 08:57.829
I love you.

09:10.185 --> 09:13.609
- Hello.
- I need to talk to you.

09:14.189 --> 09:16.457
- Stop, I'm serious.
- What?

09:16.537 --> 09:19.681
They fired me. My whole floor.

09:19.761 --> 09:22.205
- What? When?
- Are you just getting here?

09:22.285 --> 09:24.353
- Did you not hear?
- I was running late.

09:24.433 --> 09:27.123
It's a massacre.
You have to go and do something.

09:27.203 --> 09:29.191
This is unacceptable.

09:29.271 --> 09:31.396
I'll take care of it. Don't worry.

09:34.042 --> 09:35.596
Exactly.

09:36.770 --> 09:38.327
Yes.

09:40.048 --> 09:42.531
Steven. Sorry. I...

09:42.980 --> 09:45.627
I can't. This is important.

09:59.567 --> 10:01.110
Hey.

10:03.638 --> 10:05.530
I like your tie.

10:06.641 --> 10:09.866
- Did you fire Annabelle?
- Who the fuck is Annabelle?

10:09.946 --> 10:11.829
Oh, she's...

10:13.296 --> 10:15.071
...she's on the second floor.

10:16.651 --> 10:19.509
She's a really good kid
and she's not that expensive.

10:19.589 --> 10:23.106
I really don't think that you understand
the grave circumstances...

10:23.186 --> 10:25.615
...that we're in right here, right now.

10:26.495 --> 10:29.018
Alright? Yes, I fired Annabelle...

10:29.098 --> 10:33.358
...and I fired 179
other employees this morning.

10:34.902 --> 10:38.551
Okay, I'm not talking a 179 other people.
I'm just talking about Annabelle.

10:38.631 --> 10:42.275
Well, if you'd like to tender
your resignation, Bill...

10:42.611 --> 10:44.400
...then you know what?

10:44.480 --> 10:47.770
I could restore the employment...

10:47.850 --> 10:49.852
...of the entire second floor.

10:50.052 --> 10:52.274
All you have to do is sign...

10:52.354 --> 10:54.846
...right here on the dotted line.

10:55.223 --> 10:57.081
Go ahead.

10:58.259 --> 11:00.118
Sign it.

11:00.595 --> 11:02.751
Is it really that bad?

11:02.831 --> 11:05.724
It's really that bad.

11:09.568 --> 11:12.412
- Sign it.
- No, that's like...

11:12.492 --> 11:15.631
- ...that's okay.
- Sign it. Sign it.

11:15.711 --> 11:17.947
It's probably... you probably
made the right decision.

11:18.027 --> 11:19.904
Just sign it.

11:48.176 --> 11:49.702
Honey?

11:51.680 --> 11:53.736
We thought you'd be home.

11:53.816 --> 11:56.241
I postponed dinner as long as I could.

11:59.420 --> 12:01.511
You never give me a choice.

12:02.491 --> 12:04.714
There's a dog watching me.

12:05.244 --> 12:07.669
Dog's always in the same spot.

12:09.664 --> 12:11.523
Been here a while.

12:21.476 --> 12:23.702
I feel like I can't breathe.

12:48.663 --> 12:50.960
We've been finished forever.

12:51.040 --> 12:53.498
May I please be excused?

12:54.442 --> 12:57.869
If you're not gonna answer,
I'm just gonna go.

13:00.448 --> 13:04.607
Wha... Mom! What about chores?
Am I supposed to load the dishwasher?

13:04.687 --> 13:06.508
It's Max's turn.

13:06.588 --> 13:10.082
Mama, may I be excused?

13:15.563 --> 13:17.855
She's not gonna answer. Just go.

13:25.907 --> 13:27.465
Mom?

13:43.091 --> 13:44.649
Mom?

13:53.935 --> 13:55.527
Mom?

13:56.738 --> 14:01.351
Are... are you upset because Dad
didn't come home for dinner again?

14:07.582 --> 14:09.174
Mom?

14:11.253 --> 14:12.844
Mom?

15:15.616 --> 15:18.476
It's called toast. You have two legs.

15:19.921 --> 15:21.814
Is there any more cereal?

15:23.858 --> 15:26.441
- What happened?
- We don't know.

15:29.530 --> 15:31.186
- Who is that dog?
- I told you.

15:31.266 --> 15:34.323
Not that dog again. There's no dog.

15:34.403 --> 15:36.260
Where's Mom?

15:36.871 --> 15:39.603
Dad, wake up! Dad!

15:39.683 --> 15:42.298
- What?
- Daddy, get up. Mom's gone.

15:42.378 --> 15:44.666
What? What do you mean, "Mom's gone?"

15:44.746 --> 15:47.836
I think she left you, and us, it's over.

15:47.916 --> 15:51.093
- What? Why would you say that?
- You have to drive us to school.

15:51.173 --> 15:54.640
No, I gotta go to work.
What do you mean Mom left? Where is she?

15:54.720 --> 15:56.512
She's not here. Now get up!

15:56.592 --> 15:59.015
- Jill?
- She's not here.

15:59.995 --> 16:02.564
- We're late. We're late.
- No.

16:02.644 --> 16:04.155
Dad!

16:04.365 --> 16:07.423
Jill, honey, where are you?

16:07.503 --> 16:09.357
Call me.

16:09.437 --> 16:12.493
We're all very worried about you.
Please call me.

16:12.573 --> 16:15.497
Dad, you got our jackets wrong.
Leave them alone.

16:15.577 --> 16:18.967
I don't have any underwear or socks on.

16:19.047 --> 16:21.370
Please, guys,
I just need a minute of silence!

16:21.450 --> 16:23.873
I don't know how to use this car, okay?

16:24.253 --> 16:27.111
How do you turn it on? Is there a...

16:31.742 --> 16:34.902
That's the key and you turn it.
Okay. Right, let's do this.

16:36.732 --> 16:39.154
- Dad, we need money for lunch.
- Great. Money.

16:40.534 --> 16:41.976
Is this enough?

16:45.640 --> 16:47.863
Wait, wait, hold on, hold on!
What about these two?

16:47.943 --> 16:50.866
- They don't go to middle school, Dad.
- I'm in kindergarten.

16:50.946 --> 16:54.806
- Middle school. Of course not. Right.
- Did you get Cindy her lunch?

16:55.483 --> 16:57.673
Well, I've got more cash.

16:57.753 --> 17:00.645
No, no, you can't buy lunch in kindergarten.

17:02.723 --> 17:05.650
Got it. Okay. Dad's on the case.

17:07.627 --> 17:11.223
"B" is for "Be nice."

17:11.303 --> 17:13.222
- C is...
- Did you see Mom last night?

17:13.301 --> 17:17.593
I don't know. I didn't see her last night.
No, because I got in late. Okay?

17:17.673 --> 17:21.213
- It's okay. No, no. You're gonna be fine.
- Cindy, hi!

17:21.943 --> 17:25.834
Look at this outfit. This is so cute!

17:25.914 --> 17:29.938
- You must be Cindy's dad.
- Yeah, listen, got a little situation.

17:30.018 --> 17:34.009
- She has no lunch.
- Oh, that's okay, honey.

17:34.589 --> 17:36.812
- And that's it. Okay?
- There's actually a grocery store...

17:36.892 --> 17:40.782
- ...right down the street, if you want to...
- Yeah, I can't. I can't do that.

17:40.862 --> 17:44.883
Can't you just bring her
to the lunchroom or somethin'?

17:46.902 --> 17:49.044
I'm sorry but all the kids here brown bag it.

17:49.124 --> 17:51.427
Jesus Christ, $25,000 a year,
you can't give her an apple?

17:51.507 --> 17:55.464
Okay. I can hear that you're frustrated.
Is everything okay? Where's Jill?

17:55.544 --> 17:59.301
Listen, this is very simple. Can't you
just whip her up somethin' real fast?

17:59.381 --> 18:01.937
- Excuse me?
- Or order a pizza?

18:02.117 --> 18:05.807
Or make all the other kids share
their lunches? I have to go to work.

18:05.887 --> 18:09.611
This is very simple. You can do
whatever you want. She has no lunch.

18:09.691 --> 18:13.021
- She has no lunch.
- Dad?

18:13.101 --> 18:14.705
Hug?

18:19.200 --> 18:21.723
Alright, I'm sure Mom's gonna
be home when you get back.

18:21.803 --> 18:25.227
Hey, listen, Cindy, I have to go.
I have to go now.

18:25.307 --> 18:27.062
- Cindy, I have to go.
- No!

18:27.142 --> 18:28.290
- No!
- Okay. It's okay.

18:28.370 --> 18:31.967
Yeah, no, I know that I'm late.
I'm having a family crisis...

18:32.047 --> 18:34.436
...and I had to drop my kids off at school.

18:34.516 --> 18:36.429
I know. I know.

18:36.509 --> 18:39.777
I think Jill may have left me. No, I'm fine.

18:44.825 --> 18:47.982
What? Sorry.
No, you just cut up for a second.

18:48.069 --> 18:51.186
Just buy me some time.
I will be there in 20 minutes.

18:51.266 --> 18:53.755
30, Max. Maybe 40.

18:53.835 --> 18:55.890
I don't know where I am.

18:55.970 --> 18:59.328
Can you figure out a way
to pick my kids up from school?

18:59.408 --> 19:01.632
Alright. I have to go.

19:04.710 --> 19:06.735
You fuckin' bitch!

19:07.315 --> 19:11.039
You goddamn selfish
fuckin' crazy bitch! I knew it!

19:11.119 --> 19:13.942
I fuckin' knew you would do
something like this to me.

19:14.022 --> 19:16.678
I gave you fuckin' everything
and this is how you say thank you?

19:16.758 --> 19:19.481
You fuckin' bitch, you bitch!

19:19.561 --> 19:21.786
You bitch!

19:30.555 --> 19:33.562
Jed, hey! Hey!

19:33.642 --> 19:37.873
Hey, bud. I didn't... I didn't see you
there. I forgot you were there.

19:37.953 --> 19:41.269
- Are you okay?
- Who, me? Yeah, of course.

19:41.349 --> 19:43.205
I'm fabulous.

19:43.685 --> 19:46.575
Say, bud, can you...
can you just remind me...

19:47.325 --> 19:49.912
- ...where your school is again?
- This is it.

19:49.992 --> 19:52.614
- This is it?
- Yeah.

19:52.694 --> 19:55.186
Well, hell, let's go, bud.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.956
- You forgot about me.
- I did not forget about you.

20:01.036 --> 20:03.525
You actually just said you forgot I was here.

20:03.605 --> 20:06.106
- Yeah, well, it is a figure of speech.
- Meaning what?

20:06.186 --> 20:08.997
Meaning... sorry, bud.
Can you just help me unblock this thing here?

20:09.077 --> 20:12.968
- Why did Mom leave you?
- I don't know, Jed, but we'll figure it out.

20:13.048 --> 20:15.736
She'll probably be in home
in time for dinner.

20:15.816 --> 20:18.509
Alright. Okay, let's go.

20:19.220 --> 20:21.679
Wait! My backpack!

20:24.225 --> 20:25.783
Okay.

20:34.335 --> 20:36.361
Go play. Go play!

20:49.382 --> 20:51.106
I have your wife's sister
returning your call.

20:51.186 --> 20:54.610
And everyone's still waiting
for you in the conference room.

20:54.690 --> 20:56.284
Yeah, I'll take it.

21:02.263 --> 21:05.086
- Beth.
- Bill.

21:05.166 --> 21:07.024
How are you?

21:08.002 --> 21:09.524
Fine.

21:10.304 --> 21:13.328
Is everything okay? 'Cause you never call me.

21:13.408 --> 21:15.230
Should I be worried?

21:16.110 --> 21:18.703
- Is Jill with you?
- No. Why?

21:21.982 --> 21:23.007
Yeah.

21:23.087 --> 21:25.506
You're weirding me out. What's goin' on?

21:26.169 --> 21:29.444
Well, I don't know. She's... she's gone.

21:29.524 --> 21:32.550
What do you mean she's gone?
When did you see her last?

21:32.630 --> 21:35.784
- I don't know...
- You don't know?

21:35.864 --> 21:40.909
Maybe yesterday at breakfast but I've
called her phone 15 times, Beth, and...

21:40.989 --> 21:43.892
Okay, just calm down. Alright.

21:43.972 --> 21:46.728
I'm sure that there is an easy explanation.

21:46.808 --> 21:50.299
If she was going to leave you
she would've told me by now, so...

21:50.679 --> 21:55.403
Well, she's not gonna leave me.
That she... we're... we're very happy.

21:55.483 --> 21:57.341
Very happy.

22:01.155 --> 22:02.713
Okay.

22:08.362 --> 22:10.221
I just...

22:12.533 --> 22:15.891
...I might need your help, Beth.
Can you help me?

22:15.971 --> 22:19.263
- Yes, of course.
- Okay.

22:21.609 --> 22:26.134
It's okay, Beth. I mean, she's okay, right?

22:26.214 --> 22:28.270
I don't know, Bill.

22:28.350 --> 22:30.772
Okay, we'll find her together.
Just meet me at the house, alright?

22:30.852 --> 22:34.674
Okay. Okay, thank you.
Thank you, Beth, so much. Bye.

22:40.027 --> 22:42.016
I'm comin'.

22:42.096 --> 22:46.521
Okay. What are the names of your kids'
schools? I don't have it on file.

22:48.101 --> 22:50.194
I don't know. Can you Google it?

22:53.974 --> 22:58.433
There are a lot of schools in town.
So, I could Google it, but...

23:01.849 --> 23:03.705
I'll check billing.

23:03.785 --> 23:06.074
Can I let everyone know that you're
on your way to the conference room?

23:06.154 --> 23:08.212
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

23:09.457 --> 23:11.346
Are you?

23:11.426 --> 23:13.415
Yeah, yeah.

23:13.495 --> 23:15.018
Yeah.

23:17.865 --> 23:20.924
Yeah, it'll... just right
across the hall there.

23:29.544 --> 23:31.402
Thanks, sir.

23:34.482 --> 23:37.285
- Do you think Mom's back?
- Who knows?

23:39.553 --> 23:43.545
There's... guys... there's...
You guys! Come see this.

23:43.625 --> 23:45.480
- How'd you guys get home?
- Taxi, man.

23:45.560 --> 23:47.749
- Tiff!
- Jed, one sec.

23:47.829 --> 23:49.885
- What did you eat for lunch?
- I ate Ms. Cole's lunch.

23:49.965 --> 23:53.191
You guys! Come see this! Come on.

23:56.003 --> 23:58.894
- What's that smell?
- Mom's clothes.

23:58.974 --> 24:01.199
Cindy, Jed, leave the kitchen.

24:01.942 --> 24:05.165
That's poop, Max. That's poop.

24:05.245 --> 24:08.584
- What happened to Mom?
- I'm not kidding, guys. Out of here, now!

24:08.664 --> 24:11.879
What is it like, like a serial killer
or something? Are we in danger?

24:11.959 --> 24:13.942
I don't know. I don't know.

24:14.022 --> 24:15.844
We need to call Dad.

24:15.924 --> 24:17.782
I'm calling the cops.

24:39.381 --> 24:40.802
- Kids!
- Hello!

24:40.882 --> 24:43.271
- Aunt Beth!
- Honey, sweetie.

24:43.351 --> 24:46.373
- Okay, did your mom call?
- No.

24:47.923 --> 24:50.512
- Max, can you do that...
- Oh, God! What's that smell?

24:50.592 --> 24:52.781
...find my iPhone thing on your mom's phone.

24:52.861 --> 24:54.715
Phone's in the kitchen.

24:55.295 --> 24:59.187
- Why would her phone be here?
- Cind, Cind, stop.

24:59.267 --> 25:01.423
- We need to call the cops.
- Okay, not for 24 hours.

25:01.503 --> 25:04.792
- We need to call now.
- Guys!

25:05.306 --> 25:07.998
- Guys!
- What? What Tiff, what?

25:09.243 --> 25:11.102
We found Mom.

25:11.912 --> 25:13.634
- Where is she?
- Oh, thank God.

25:13.714 --> 25:15.273
We...

25:17.652 --> 25:19.510
Mom is...

25:20.354 --> 25:22.212
Mom's what?

25:25.459 --> 25:28.617
What's funny? Guys? Guys!

25:28.997 --> 25:32.520
- You wouldn't believe it.
- Well, we found her but...

25:34.134 --> 25:36.825
Someone tell me what is going on right now?

25:36.905 --> 25:39.396
Mom is being a...

25:40.098 --> 25:42.332
She's not being herself.

25:45.079 --> 25:46.534
What?

25:46.614 --> 25:49.387
- We have to show you.
- Totally.

25:52.619 --> 25:54.442
Mom is in the basement?

25:54.522 --> 25:57.014
She's been down there this whole time.

25:58.959 --> 26:00.517
Jill?

26:01.028 --> 26:02.586
Jillie?

26:03.230 --> 26:04.919
Jill!

26:04.999 --> 26:08.893
- Why isn't she answering?
- It's kind of hard to explain.

26:10.637 --> 26:13.897
Oh, God, what is that smell?

26:16.978 --> 26:18.803
What the hell was that?

26:19.513 --> 26:22.103
- Did you guys get a dog?
- No.

26:22.183 --> 26:26.279
Mom doesn't want us here.
She barks louder when we're here.

26:30.858 --> 26:34.005
- Kids, stay up there.
- It's Mom, Dad.

26:49.343 --> 26:51.484
That's not Jill.

27:15.670 --> 27:18.280
- Make the goddamn call!
- What's he gonna do? Take her pulse?

27:18.360 --> 27:20.662
He's a family doctor.
He treats runny noses not...

27:20.742 --> 27:24.299
Okay. Dr. Linnenwell is better. He will
refer her out. He will call a specialist.

27:24.379 --> 27:28.472
He will have an explanation.
Just make the goddamn call!

27:29.116 --> 27:30.771
Alright.

27:35.957 --> 27:39.314
- See. Straight to voice mail.
- That's because it's the middle of the night.

27:39.394 --> 27:43.821
Call his cellphone
and stop acting like a child.

27:49.804 --> 27:51.903
I don't know what I'm gonna say to him.

27:56.843 --> 27:59.034
Dr. Linnenwell.

27:59.214 --> 28:02.370
Bill Hart, Jill's husband.

28:02.450 --> 28:04.872
Yes. Right.

28:06.332 --> 28:09.705
I... Jill tells me that you're coachin'
a pretty mean little league.

28:09.785 --> 28:11.780
What the fuck?

28:11.860 --> 28:15.297
Right. Sorry. No, I know.
I'm sorry. I know it's late.

28:15.377 --> 28:18.588
Well, I... we're having a bit of a...

28:20.068 --> 28:23.191
...I guess you could call it
a situation over here.

28:23.271 --> 28:26.500
It's... it's not a big deal but...

28:27.075 --> 28:30.300
...could you possibly come
over here and look at my wife?

28:31.578 --> 28:34.405
Yeah, like, like right now would be great.

28:36.950 --> 28:39.143
It's not... not an emergency.

28:45.291 --> 28:47.334
Well, all I could do is...

28:48.996 --> 28:52.554
- ...I sedated her.
- Okay. Yeah.

28:52.634 --> 28:55.190
She needs some really serious help, Bill.

28:55.270 --> 28:56.774
Yes.

28:57.154 --> 29:01.362
What... what can we do to help?
Who can help us?

29:01.442 --> 29:04.699
Actually, I do know a specialist
that's right for this sort of thing.

29:04.779 --> 29:07.569
- Zya Price.
- This is confidential.

29:07.649 --> 29:09.738
Right, Dr. Linnenwell?
It's the doctor-patient thing.

29:09.818 --> 29:12.073
- This is all... it's private.
- What?

29:12.153 --> 29:15.212
Of course, it is. It always is, Bill.

29:16.390 --> 29:21.152
Listen, she knows you. Can you stay?

29:22.129 --> 29:24.920
Yeah, I have human feces on my face, Bill.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.422
I kinda like to wash up.

29:27.802 --> 29:32.193
Yes. There is a bathroom
right down the hall to your left.

29:32.273 --> 29:33.864
Okay.

29:35.341 --> 29:38.835
- Call Price.
- Okay. Price. Zya Price.

29:39.012 --> 29:40.537
Yep.

29:45.185 --> 29:47.244
He better not tell anyone.

29:48.021 --> 29:49.214
What?

29:49.294 --> 29:52.780
He better not tell anyone,
did you see... shit?

29:52.860 --> 29:56.718
- Like on his face.
- Jesus Christ, Bill.

29:57.398 --> 30:00.648
My sister is down there covered in shit!

30:00.728 --> 30:03.625
Beth, listen to me,
this is a very bad time for me.

30:03.705 --> 30:08.639
I have to be at work 18 hours a day
right now not dealing with her shit, okay?

30:08.719 --> 30:11.266
Jill can't do this.
She cannot do this to me right now.

30:11.346 --> 30:13.248
I'm not the one who's bailing
on my kids, okay?

30:13.328 --> 30:15.120
I'm still doin' what I'm supposed
to be doin'.

30:15.200 --> 30:17.639
She's the one who's down there...

30:17.719 --> 30:18.706
...takin' a break.

30:36.737 --> 30:39.194
She's not talking, like you said...

30:39.874 --> 30:41.906
...and behaving like a domestic dog.

30:43.645 --> 30:45.234
Right.

30:46.414 --> 30:49.838
She's urinating, excreting on herself.

30:50.418 --> 30:55.424
She seems unresponsive as if unable
to hear what's happening around her.

30:56.124 --> 31:01.048
You know, it seems unclear if she's
self-aware at this point or if she's not.

31:01.128 --> 31:03.353
I sure hope she's not self-aware.

31:06.166 --> 31:08.474
Why is that, Mr. Hart?

31:09.304 --> 31:13.182
If she knows what she's doing right now
I will never fuckin' forgive her.

31:14.891 --> 31:17.565
I understand your frustration, Mr. Hart.

31:17.645 --> 31:20.869
This is a tremendously challenging situation.

31:21.249 --> 31:24.172
Is there a name...

31:24.252 --> 31:27.942
...a medical term for this condition...

31:28.022 --> 31:30.481
...for how she's behaving?

31:31.308 --> 31:33.214
Behaving like a dog.

31:37.130 --> 31:40.469
Do... do you think so? Really?

31:40.549 --> 31:43.758
Wow, that's... I mean,
it's a very astute observation.

31:44.438 --> 31:45.513
Is it the barking?

31:45.593 --> 31:50.001
I think that I'm just a little overwhelmed
by your insight here, doctor.

31:51.611 --> 31:55.803
The police department
would case this as a 51-50.

31:55.883 --> 31:58.206
Unspecified psychiatric condition.

31:58.286 --> 32:00.114
Okay, what the fuck is that?

32:00.194 --> 32:02.610
There have been similar cases.

32:02.690 --> 32:08.249
There was a Scottish doctor, Dr. R.D. Lang
who had a case like this...

32:08.329 --> 32:10.187
...another housewife.

32:13.834 --> 32:15.857
- I've read about that...
- Okay, this is enough.

32:15.937 --> 32:19.594
I want a refund. This is some WebMD shit.
I can Google all of this.

32:19.674 --> 32:24.699
Okay. Bill, please. I'm sorry.
My brother-in-law, he hasn't slept.

32:24.779 --> 32:27.348
- She hasn't slept, either.
- Well, taking care of your kids, okay?

32:27.428 --> 32:30.012
I didn't ask you to take care of my kids.
I asked you to help me figure out...

32:30.092 --> 32:32.943
...what's going on
with your selfish fuckin' sister.

32:34.287 --> 32:39.647
Let's keep the focus on Jill
and what she needs. Okay?

32:39.727 --> 32:44.386
And what she needs is care
that I can't provide for her here.

32:45.166 --> 32:48.993
I think you should consider
a more conducive medical environment.

32:53.206 --> 32:55.663
You mean, a crazy house.

32:55.743 --> 32:59.334
She needs comprehensive psychiatric care.

32:59.414 --> 33:03.638
This will be a process and it may
take some time, but rest assured...

33:03.718 --> 33:07.178
She's not going to a mental facility, okay?
She's my wife. I will not allow that.

33:07.258 --> 33:10.477
I fuckin' hate talkin' to people like you
because you're not making anything better...

33:10.557 --> 33:13.181
- ...you're just stirring fear around.
- But she's trying to help.

33:13.261 --> 33:16.384
She's not going
to a mental institution, okay?

33:16.464 --> 33:18.386
And what I would like from you...

33:18.466 --> 33:22.490
...is a prescription for my wife
right here, right now.

33:22.570 --> 33:24.955
Please, that is what I'm paying you for.

33:31.595 --> 33:34.152
She needs full-time psychiatric...

33:34.232 --> 33:35.689
Yep!

34:17.524 --> 34:19.049
Yeah.

34:34.541 --> 34:38.132
It's okay, it's okay.

34:38.212 --> 34:41.335
You're gonna be okay. I'm right here.

34:41.415 --> 34:43.438
Sissy, I can see you.

34:43.918 --> 34:45.742
I can see you.

34:47.588 --> 34:49.811
We're gonna get through this, okay?

34:49.891 --> 34:51.679
I'm here.

34:51.759 --> 34:53.880
I'm gonna take care of you now.

34:53.960 --> 34:57.652
No more Bill, no more kids, just us.

34:57.732 --> 35:01.122
It's okay. We'll get you out of here soon.

35:01.202 --> 35:03.291
I'm gonna find some help.

35:03.371 --> 35:06.894
I see you, Sissy. I see you.

35:06.974 --> 35:08.965
I see you...

35:10.912 --> 35:14.404
Don't hurt me, don't even hurt me. Sorry.

35:15.616 --> 35:17.188
Stop!

35:56.624 --> 35:58.946
- Hello, Hart residence.
- Tiffany, dear?

35:59.026 --> 36:01.015
It's Cindy. May I ask who's speaking?

36:01.095 --> 36:04.919
Hi, Cindy, that's very polite.
It's Nana. I wanna speak to Mommy.

36:04.999 --> 36:07.088
Mom just can't talk right now.

36:07.268 --> 36:10.324
Well, could you ask her
to call me when she can?

36:10.404 --> 36:12.259
She'll be a while.

36:12.839 --> 36:16.900
- You're not supposed to be on the phone.
- Hey, that was Nana!

36:20.313 --> 36:24.705
Okay, Jill. You wanna act like a dog,
we'll treat you like a dog.

36:24.785 --> 36:26.656
There you go.

37:02.355 --> 37:04.761
Tiff, it's not Christmas.

37:07.228 --> 37:09.119
I know that, right?

37:43.328 --> 37:46.189
Merry Christmas, everybody!

37:49.235 --> 37:53.461
Merry Christmas, you guys. Who did this?

37:53.541 --> 37:56.704
It's so pretty. What else do we have?

37:57.565 --> 38:01.438
Cindy. Let's put the star
on the top of the tree and finish it.

38:02.349 --> 38:03.968
- Cindy, hey.
- No!

38:04.048 --> 38:05.338
Come on.

38:05.418 --> 38:08.902
Come on. Come on, come on, come on,
come on! Hey, hey, hey, come on!

38:08.982 --> 38:13.447
Go put it on the tree. Go put the star on
the tree and finish it so Santa can come.

38:13.527 --> 38:15.383
Cindy, come on.
Come on, let's do this, alright?

38:15.463 --> 38:17.852
- Bill, listen.
- Put the star on the tree.

38:17.932 --> 38:21.122
- Cindy, come on! Let's put the star on...
- Bill?

38:21.202 --> 38:22.923
- No!
- It'll be fun!

38:23.003 --> 38:25.459
Let's put this star on the top of the tree!

38:25.539 --> 38:28.696
- Bill!
- Cindy, just... what? What?

38:28.776 --> 38:31.699
Beth, come on,
where is your Christmas spirit?

38:31.779 --> 38:34.001
- Daddy!
- Dad, you're scaring her.

38:34.081 --> 38:37.071
What do you mean? We're having a great time!

38:37.151 --> 38:40.576
Right? We're havin'
a solidly fuckin' great time!

38:44.190 --> 38:46.282
Is that Christmas carolers?

38:51.765 --> 38:55.756
Hey, good evening, sir. I'm officer Frill.
We got a call on the 51-50.

38:55.836 --> 38:57.393
Okay.

38:58.204 --> 38:59.794
Christmas?

39:00.274 --> 39:04.198
There's no reason for you to be here.
Everything is fine.

39:04.278 --> 39:07.689
Sir, I'm gonna need to take a look
at your wife to make the determination.

39:08.481 --> 39:12.413
Not if I don't ask you in.
You're not and I'm not askin' you in.

39:12.493 --> 39:13.841
- Sir.
- I know my rights.

39:13.921 --> 39:16.811
And I know her rights.
You're not allowed to take her away...

39:16.891 --> 39:20.347
...unless she's a danger to herself
or others, and she isn't.

39:20.427 --> 39:23.484
I do not consent to her being hospitalized.

39:23.864 --> 39:27.307
And you need to leave or I'm calling
my lawyer. Is that clear?

39:29.502 --> 39:32.145
Sir, I'm still gonna need to see your wife.

39:34.140 --> 39:35.695
Fine.

39:36.075 --> 39:39.166
Right this way. She is in the basement.

39:39.246 --> 39:41.836
Down. It's the little door on your right.

39:41.916 --> 39:43.573
Bring a chew toy?

39:55.395 --> 39:57.712
Send immediate backup.

39:57.792 --> 39:59.653
- I can't, I can't.
- What?

39:59.733 --> 40:01.291
Daddy!

40:03.903 --> 40:05.542
Cindy, he's not coming back.

40:56.756 --> 41:01.115
Then I thought, why not, let's just
run away and leave the kids, you and I.

41:01.195 --> 41:03.651
They'll be fine. They don't need us.

41:03.731 --> 41:05.720
- Yeah.
- Right?

41:05.800 --> 41:07.657
We could do whatever we want.

41:10.404 --> 41:13.263
- You look so different.
- I do?

41:20.780 --> 41:23.987
- You look so different.
- I do?

42:37.123 --> 42:39.046
And you're relaxing watching TV.

42:39.126 --> 42:41.882
- What else?
- Story, story. You promised to...

42:41.962 --> 42:44.387
Tiffany!

42:45.899 --> 42:48.789
- You...
- Get out!

42:48.869 --> 42:51.748
- Max.
- You left. Get out!

42:52.906 --> 42:55.373
I went for a walk. I'm sorry.

42:55.453 --> 42:58.701
- You're not sorry.
- I understand that you're ups...

42:58.781 --> 43:01.268
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Get out! Get out!

43:01.348 --> 43:03.871
- Get out! Get out!
- Okay.

43:03.951 --> 43:07.041
- Stop that! Stop that!
- It's okay. Okay, it's okay.

43:07.121 --> 43:08.742
- Stop hitting daddy!
- Don't do that!

43:08.822 --> 43:10.679
It's okay. Hey.

43:36.984 --> 43:39.239
- Yello?
- Mr. Hart?

43:39.319 --> 43:42.076
This is Stella White
from UCLA Medical Center.

43:42.156 --> 43:44.111
We received a police report
from your sister-in-law...

43:44.191 --> 43:48.482
No. No. That's... she was wrong.
There was a mistake.

43:48.562 --> 43:51.220
We don't need you. Thank you, bye.

44:03.777 --> 44:06.236
I'm done! A little more milk.

44:55.545 --> 44:58.187
You have 27 new messages.

44:59.632 --> 45:02.990
Bill? Bill, where are you?

45:03.070 --> 45:06.093
Everyone's still waiting
for you in the conference room...

45:06.173 --> 45:08.231
...when you get around to it.

45:10.744 --> 45:14.501
Hart, it's your father-in-law.
Call me back. We need to talk about Jill.

45:14.581 --> 45:17.673
It's imperative that we come by and see...

45:27.527 --> 45:29.352
Stay, stay.

45:43.142 --> 45:45.499
It still smells like shit in here.

45:45.579 --> 45:47.668
It smells worse in the basement.

45:47.748 --> 45:49.603
It's making me suicidal.

45:50.183 --> 45:55.011
- I said I wanna die.
- Me, too. What's suicidal?

46:15.474 --> 46:17.905
You know what? We're gonna eat.

46:18.445 --> 46:20.901
And then we're gonna get ready
for school tomorrow. Let's go.

46:20.981 --> 46:22.569
Hey, Bill, it's Stephen.

46:22.649 --> 46:26.440
Comin' up on a week now since you've
graced us with your magical presence.

46:26.520 --> 46:30.414
I'd love to see you tomorrow morning
if you can fit it into your schedule.

46:38.598 --> 46:42.122
I can't tell if... if she's in there...

46:42.202 --> 46:45.227
...or if she's gone. I...

46:47.273 --> 46:49.709
Well, what if she's gonna be gone forever?

46:53.111 --> 46:55.004
Brian, I gotta go.

46:55.815 --> 46:58.205
Okay, I love you. Yes.

46:58.285 --> 47:00.574
I love you so much. I love you. I love you.

47:00.654 --> 47:03.345
Okay, yeah. Alright, bye.

47:04.489 --> 47:06.315
Oh, God!

47:07.761 --> 47:09.619
Oh, my God!

47:11.931 --> 47:14.454
Oh, God! That's bad.

47:14.534 --> 47:16.425
That was bad.

47:17.336 --> 47:19.195
Oh, God!

47:25.545 --> 47:27.370
Who's Brian?

47:29.982 --> 47:33.095
- What?
- Who's Brian?

47:34.687 --> 47:36.821
Brian's my husband. Bill.

47:36.901 --> 47:40.950
Right, right, right. I... I was just kidding.

47:44.931 --> 47:46.789
Are they all asleep?

47:49.201 --> 47:51.093
The kids? Yeah.

47:56.609 --> 47:58.201
I...

48:01.380 --> 48:02.905
I...

48:04.717 --> 48:07.077
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get fired tomorrow.

48:08.321 --> 48:09.910
And...

48:10.290 --> 48:14.314
...I don't know what I am without my job.

48:14.394 --> 48:16.219
I don't know...

48:17.730 --> 48:22.091
...who we are without this life.
I mean, I may have to...

48:23.702 --> 48:26.426
...sell the house and the cars...

48:26.506 --> 48:29.396
...and we'll have to change schools...

48:29.476 --> 48:31.968
...to public schools. I mean, what...

48:33.813 --> 48:36.672
...what kind of a man am I?

48:43.256 --> 48:45.147
Listen, we...

48:46.624 --> 48:49.149
I understand that you don't
want Jill to go to a hospital...

48:49.229 --> 48:52.086
...but there's something
really wrong with her.

48:52.466 --> 48:54.724
You get that, right?

49:06.879 --> 49:10.638
Do you know how Jill and I met?
Did she ever tell you that story?

49:11.218 --> 49:12.808
Yeah.

49:13.619 --> 49:16.078
Jill told me like, a million times.

49:18.025 --> 49:19.883
You know...

49:23.294 --> 49:25.955
Can't... I just...

49:28.812 --> 49:30.624
It's just...

49:31.204 --> 49:34.463
- I just can't...
- Hey, hey.

49:35.442 --> 49:37.864
Hey, hey, it's okay.

49:37.944 --> 49:41.201
- It's okay.
- Sometimes I just wish that...

49:42.181 --> 49:43.437
...my dick was smaller.

49:43.517 --> 49:46.967
Like, if my dick was smaller,
none of this would have happened.

49:52.423 --> 49:54.917
Did she ever talk to you about it?

49:56.595 --> 49:59.455
Wait, what? About your dick?

50:02.001 --> 50:03.609
Yeah.

50:06.772 --> 50:09.031
No, Bill.

50:16.182 --> 50:17.740
Sorry.

50:18.851 --> 50:21.948
Listen, my parents
are going to come to see her.

50:22.028 --> 50:26.780
No. No. Why? That will be so shameful.

50:26.860 --> 50:29.349
I already feel like I failed her.

50:29.429 --> 50:32.919
Well, you have, Bill, you have.
I'm sorry, but they need to see her.

50:32.999 --> 50:35.355
They need to see their daughter.

50:35.435 --> 50:37.724
Beth, please, please. Please don't do this.

50:37.804 --> 50:42.269
Your parents already hated me
before this and I'm... I'm lost.

50:42.609 --> 50:46.005
And this is not about saving face.
I promise, this is... I just...

50:46.580 --> 50:48.335
...I don't want my wife to be cuckoo.

50:48.415 --> 50:52.025
I don't want Jill to be sent
to some kind of mental institution.

50:52.105 --> 50:56.962
I can't subject Jill and the kids to that
kind of life. There has to be some other...

50:57.042 --> 50:58.714
...alternative.

51:01.193 --> 51:02.752
Okay.

51:06.732 --> 51:08.255
There...

51:08.835 --> 51:12.059
...there are some things
that I need to take care of.

51:12.539 --> 51:15.195
- Okay.
- Outside of here.

51:15.275 --> 51:17.131
For my life.

51:17.811 --> 51:21.637
But I will be back. I promise, okay?

51:24.617 --> 51:27.276
Do you think that you are ready?

51:30.256 --> 51:34.784
Yo, yeah. I mean, are you kidding me?
I'm... I was born ready.

51:58.585 --> 51:59.606
Tiffany, sorry.

51:59.686 --> 52:03.410
Dad, you almost made me spill
the last of the cold kokum water.

52:03.490 --> 52:06.646
We don't have any food left. We're so hungry.

52:06.726 --> 52:09.249
Jed's been trying to eat dog food
for the past three days.

52:09.329 --> 52:12.352
And if he can figure out
how to open the can, then he will.

52:12.432 --> 52:14.871
So what are you going to do about it?

52:21.541 --> 52:24.087
You just looked like your mom for a second.

52:27.813 --> 52:29.539
Oh, my God!

52:30.449 --> 52:33.540
You're... you're not even listening to me.

52:33.620 --> 52:37.233
You don't even care about what I'm saying.
Yes. No. Yes, I do. Tiff, I heard.

52:37.313 --> 52:39.807
I heard everything. I heard everything.
Come here, come here.

52:39.887 --> 52:41.932
- Why won't you listen to me?
- No, no, no.

52:42.012 --> 52:45.220
- What's happening?
- It's okay. It's alright.

52:45.565 --> 52:47.423
Just breathe.

52:47.533 --> 52:49.323
- What's going on?
- It's alright...

52:49.403 --> 52:52.892
We're gonna be homeless
and we're gonna get diseases and die.

52:52.972 --> 52:55.929
- We're going to live under a bridge.
- When we're dead?

52:56.009 --> 52:58.921
No, no, no, no. No, Jed.
It's okay, it's alright.

52:59.001 --> 53:03.005
Here, come here, everybody.
Let's... let's sit down. Here.

53:04.750 --> 53:06.306
Okay.

53:06.686 --> 53:09.142
I know that this is confusing...

53:09.222 --> 53:12.446
...and I know that you're all
scared, and I am, too.

53:12.526 --> 53:16.251
I really am, but we're a still family.

53:16.729 --> 53:20.790
- Okay?
- But Mom's a dog.

53:22.835 --> 53:26.660
Yeah, bud, yeah, she is a dog
but she's still your mom.

53:27.240 --> 53:31.066
And we are going to stand by her
no matter what.

53:31.744 --> 53:33.269
Okay?

53:34.480 --> 53:36.303
Because Mom needs us.

53:37.083 --> 53:39.306
So we gotta be tough...

53:39.386 --> 53:41.478
...and we're gonna get through this.

53:42.821 --> 53:44.845
Okay, we're gonna get through this together.

53:45.725 --> 53:47.249
Yeah.

53:50.095 --> 53:53.922
But what if Mom never ever changes back?

54:56.562 --> 54:58.418
How are you, Bill?

54:58.698 --> 55:01.054
Well, fantastic.

55:01.134 --> 55:06.879
You know, it would really be unethical
for me to mention anything about...

55:06.959 --> 55:11.564
...your wife in any conversation
regarding job performance.

55:11.644 --> 55:13.567
- Right.
- So, tell me this.

55:13.647 --> 55:16.705
What the fuck is going on with your wife?

55:18.150 --> 55:19.708
Well...

55:21.786 --> 55:24.921
- ...it's a bit... it's a bit complex.
- You can't be out of pocket like this.

55:25.001 --> 55:29.249
No, I understand, I understand that.
And we are on a good path now.

55:29.329 --> 55:32.385
And if you just bear with us
for a little bit longer...

55:32.465 --> 55:35.555
- Bill, you should stop talking.
- Okay, okay.

55:35.635 --> 55:40.093
Now, you know, this part of my job
isn't very easy, is it?

55:40.173 --> 55:43.145
- Lately, things have just...
- Hang on.

55:43.225 --> 55:45.655
- Wait a minute.
- This is not a negotiation, Bill.

55:45.735 --> 55:48.935
Don't. Please, please, Stephen.
Just wait... just wait a second.

55:49.015 --> 55:52.172
- Bill, listen, let's just not...
- Wait! Wait. Could you just wait?

55:52.252 --> 55:55.310
- Just for one second, please!
- Okay!

55:55.988 --> 55:58.047
Okay, Bill, I'm waiting.

55:59.691 --> 56:02.117
Just... thank you.

56:15.541 --> 56:17.065
Okay.

56:18.411 --> 56:22.491
Okay, Stephen, listen to this.
This is gonna be great.

56:23.448 --> 56:25.007
Okay.

56:26.552 --> 56:28.410
The home program.

56:31.390 --> 56:32.846
The home program.

56:32.926 --> 56:36.616
Well, the home program is a program...

56:36.696 --> 56:40.356
...where executives can...

56:41.767 --> 56:43.256
...essentially work...

56:43.336 --> 56:46.228
- Work from home.
- Exactly.

56:48.608 --> 56:53.132
Now, think about this, think about the
goodwill that the firm will get from this.

56:53.212 --> 56:55.441
- The home program for the home.
- Bill.

56:55.521 --> 56:58.538
It's a company that doesn't
only care about the bottom line.

56:58.618 --> 57:02.308
It's a company that cares about people.
This is a company that cares about families.

57:02.388 --> 57:05.889
I mean, this is good. This is good PR stuff.
This is fortune 500 stuff.

57:06.109 --> 57:10.918
- This is Oprah calling you. You know?
- Bill, I don't think so.

57:12.098 --> 57:15.054
- I'm going to have to...
- Okay, don't, don't, don't say it.

57:15.134 --> 57:19.228
Okay, okay, okay, let's forget that,
forget the home program.

57:27.112 --> 57:29.936
- Jesus Christ.
- What if you give me my bonus...

57:30.016 --> 57:33.339
...a little bit early and then I can
hire a nurse and a live-in nanny?

57:33.419 --> 57:37.604
And I'll be back at my desk
24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

57:37.684 --> 57:43.116
- It'll be exactly like it was before.
- Bill, I can't. Please.

57:43.196 --> 57:45.852
Please, please, please, Stephen. Please.

57:45.932 --> 57:49.856
I don't have anything else.
Don't take this from me, okay?

57:49.936 --> 57:53.995
I will do anything, I'll do anything.
Anything, anything, anything, anything.

57:55.007 --> 57:57.032
Three months' severance.

58:03.081 --> 58:04.974
Go home to your kids.

59:09.114 --> 59:10.528
Kids!

59:10.608 --> 59:14.609
Follow the skunk. Follow the skunk.
It's walkin' away. It's walkin' away.

59:19.124 --> 59:22.315
Yeah, look at the alligator. Look at
the alligator. But my skunk's better.

59:22.395 --> 59:25.019
- Look at the skunk.
- Mom!

01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:09.228
Hey, hey, guys, I don't think Mom is
feeling like playing with us right now.

01:00:09.308 --> 01:00:13.333
So why don't we leave her alone and...

01:00:14.213 --> 01:00:17.272
- ...let's go get ice cream?
- Yes!

01:00:18.283 --> 01:00:20.041
Okay.

01:00:31.864 --> 01:00:33.886
Who wants to give their dad
a bite of ice cream?

01:00:33.966 --> 01:00:35.188
- Not me.
- Totally not me.

01:00:35.268 --> 01:00:37.927
- Me.
- Thank you, Cin.

01:00:39.871 --> 01:00:42.762
What is that, mint?
Is that your favorite flavor?

01:00:42.842 --> 01:00:46.699
Mint is my favorite flavor.
Chocolate. Yes, chocolate.

01:00:46.779 --> 01:00:48.670
Jed, we have the same flavor.

01:00:58.156 --> 01:00:59.512
- Kids, go in the house.
- Who is that?

01:00:59.592 --> 01:01:01.147
- Just go inside now.
- Come on, guys.

01:01:01.227 --> 01:01:03.117
Come on.

01:01:05.330 --> 01:01:07.139
Where are you parked?

01:01:17.243 --> 01:01:18.965
- This is you?
- Yeah.

01:01:19.045 --> 01:01:20.167
Fantastic.

01:01:22.147 --> 01:01:24.370
- What are you doing here?
- I am worried about you.

01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:27.180
I've called you, like, ten times.
Is everything okay?

01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:29.999
Yes, yeah. Everything's fine.
Annabelle, listen, I can't see you anymore.

01:01:30.079 --> 01:01:32.345
I know you'll find someone
who is right for you...

01:01:32.425 --> 01:01:35.995
...and who has room in his life for you,
but listen, bye. Bye. Thank you.

01:01:36.075 --> 01:01:38.751
Hold on... wait a second, Bill.
What's going on?

01:01:38.831 --> 01:01:40.756
People are saying weird stuff.

01:01:44.429 --> 01:01:46.759
- Private family matter.
- Really?

01:01:46.839 --> 01:01:48.061
- Yeah.
- Wow.

01:01:48.141 --> 01:01:51.030
- So...
- Your dog sounds pissed.

01:01:51.110 --> 01:01:52.541
Yeah.

01:02:05.056 --> 01:02:07.282
Beth, can you give us a minute?

01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:10.318
Is this her?

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:15.223
Beth, please, just let me handle it.

01:02:16.935 --> 01:02:19.027
I can't fuckin' believe you.

01:02:24.243 --> 01:02:26.469
- Who was that?
- Okay, Annabelle, listen.

01:02:26.549 --> 01:02:28.701
I know we shared something,
but it wasn't real.

01:02:28.781 --> 01:02:32.752
Don't ever contact me or ever
come near my family again. Okay?

01:02:33.368 --> 01:02:34.524
Beth?

01:02:35.254 --> 01:02:38.678
Beth! Hey. Please wait, wait. Okay.

01:02:38.758 --> 01:02:40.900
That was Annabelle.
That was the girl I had an affair with.

01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:43.182
She showed up completely unannounced
and I told her to go home.

01:02:43.262 --> 01:02:46.792
- I can't believe I fucking trusted you.
- You still can.

01:02:48.401 --> 01:02:51.290
No! I know how Jill feels.
Now, I know how she feels.

01:02:51.370 --> 01:02:53.684
You still can trust me. You still can
trust me. I never should've done it.

01:02:53.764 --> 01:02:57.029
It was a terrible mistake. It's over.
We need to stay on the same team here.

01:02:57.109 --> 01:03:00.444
Don't lie. I'm on Jill's fucking team.
I know why she did this.

01:03:00.524 --> 01:03:04.606
I know why this happened to her.
I understand, Bill. I fucking know why!

01:03:05.383 --> 01:03:08.808
I understand, I understand why you
don't want anyone to fucking see her...

01:03:08.888 --> 01:03:11.891
...because you fucking did this to her!
You fucking cornered my sister!

01:03:11.971 --> 01:03:14.441
You fucking crushed her!
You fucking stifled...

01:03:14.521 --> 01:03:18.231
...then you muzzled my fucking sister
until she had no other alternative...

01:03:18.311 --> 01:03:21.323
...than to turn herself into a fucking dog!

01:03:22.268 --> 01:03:26.325
Beth, please don't do this.
We need you. Okay? We need you.

01:03:26.405 --> 01:03:29.996
I know you fucking do. I know you
fucking do because you are worthless!

01:03:30.076 --> 01:03:33.122
I do everything around here.
I dress the kids.

01:03:33.202 --> 01:03:36.750
I take them to school, I clean the house,
I do the laundry. I do the dishes.

01:03:36.830 --> 01:03:38.906
I even pick up the groceries...

01:03:39.752 --> 01:03:43.409
You know what, I know,
I know what she is feeling, I know...

01:03:43.489 --> 01:03:48.200
...because she's your fucking wife
which is a full-time, thankless fucking job!

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:50.944
- Mom, Dad!
- Dad!

01:03:51.024 --> 01:03:52.854
- Dad!
- Oh, no!

01:03:53.631 --> 01:03:55.523
- Jill!
- Jill!

01:04:42.881 --> 01:04:44.413
Jill!

01:04:45.108 --> 01:04:46.694
Sissy!

01:04:48.762 --> 01:04:50.645
It's okay.

01:04:51.856 --> 01:04:53.511
Jill!

01:04:53.591 --> 01:04:55.124
Jill!

01:04:56.028 --> 01:04:57.553
Jill!

01:04:58.730 --> 01:05:00.255
Jill!

01:05:05.170 --> 01:05:06.695
Hello!

01:05:15.046 --> 01:05:16.936
Is that Jill?

01:05:17.116 --> 01:05:19.784
- No. Is that...
- Jill. Jill.

01:05:20.319 --> 01:05:23.342
- Jill. Thank God. Okay.
- Oh, God.

01:05:23.422 --> 01:05:27.115
- Thank God. Thank God.
- Come on. Come on, come on.

01:05:27.724 --> 01:05:29.596
You okay?

01:05:30.862 --> 01:05:33.118
- Get her up. Let's go.
- Come on.

01:05:34.626 --> 01:05:37.433
- Oh, my God. No.
- Jill?

01:05:37.813 --> 01:05:38.958
Cover her.

01:05:39.038 --> 01:05:40.660
- Okay. Sure. Yeah.
- Okay.

01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:42.461
You don't have to show him.

01:05:42.541 --> 01:05:45.526
- Okay. Okay.
- It's the game of trust.

01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:52.006
It's okay. Mom's back.

01:06:27.619 --> 01:06:32.001
"Big house in the sun-kissed
Santa Clara Valley.

01:06:32.081 --> 01:06:35.581
"Judge Miller's place, it was called.

01:06:35.661 --> 01:06:38.017
"It stood back from the road...

01:06:38.097 --> 01:06:40.319
"...half-hidden among the trees...

01:06:40.399 --> 01:06:42.875
...through which glimpses could be caught..."

01:06:47.839 --> 01:06:49.699
What a night!

01:06:50.242 --> 01:06:52.326
You want a beer, Brian?

01:06:52.853 --> 01:06:54.827
I don't... I don't drink, Bill.

01:06:54.907 --> 01:06:57.940
I'm in AA. You know that.
I've talked to you about me...

01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:01.076
- ...being sober, a lot.
- I know now. I know.

01:07:08.326 --> 01:07:10.487
My parents filed...

01:07:10.567 --> 01:07:13.388
...a petition for legal guardianship of Jill.

01:07:16.835 --> 01:07:19.094
We're taking you to court, Bill.

01:07:23.508 --> 01:07:25.400
Did you hear me?

01:07:26.010 --> 01:07:28.069
You're taking me to court?

01:07:28.947 --> 01:07:30.504
Yeah.

01:07:31.584 --> 01:07:34.641
We all talked it over and we think that...

01:07:35.921 --> 01:07:39.949
...Jill should come live with us
for a while and...

01:07:41.726 --> 01:07:44.851
...it'll be good for you because of
everything that's going on with the kids...

01:07:44.931 --> 01:07:50.410
...and with your finances
it'll give you an opportunity to...

01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:54.296
- ...get back on your feet.
- Jill's not going anywhere.

01:07:55.473 --> 01:07:58.846
Well, this'll be good for you, brother.
It's gonna give you some space...

01:07:58.926 --> 01:08:01.136
...to find your power again.

01:08:05.383 --> 01:08:07.640
Actually, you know what would
be even better for me, Brian...

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:09.575
...is if you let me take you
to my hairdresser's tomorrow...

01:08:09.655 --> 01:08:11.983
...and we cut all that shit off your head.

01:08:15.894 --> 01:08:17.783
Body hair is healthy.

01:08:18.464 --> 01:08:22.919
And you've never loved anything
in its organic state. I know.

01:08:23.635 --> 01:08:26.661
Maybe by doin' all this, Jill's...

01:08:28.171 --> 01:08:29.970
...doin' you a favor.

01:08:30.057 --> 01:08:31.933
Oh, really?

01:08:33.176 --> 01:08:34.934
How so?

01:08:35.014 --> 01:08:40.042
Well, she's showing you that contrary
to your entire fucking life...

01:08:41.051 --> 01:08:43.676
...you're actually a wild person, too.

01:08:44.256 --> 01:08:46.731
Dogs are like that. They're free.

01:08:49.127 --> 01:08:52.621
- What're you talkin' about?
- I'm talkin' about letting go.

01:08:54.532 --> 01:08:58.042
You can't control everything. This...

01:08:59.270 --> 01:09:01.193
...this is the life you're living...

01:09:01.273 --> 01:09:04.365
...and maybe it's the life
you're supposed to be living.

01:09:11.015 --> 01:09:12.904
This is the life that I'm supposed to live?

01:09:12.984 --> 01:09:15.808
With my wife in the fucking basement...

01:09:15.888 --> 01:09:18.379
...acting like a dog with shit everywhere?

01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:24.321
This is what it was all supposed to be.
This is part of the big plan!

01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:30.759
There will be mediation.

01:09:34.072 --> 01:09:36.131
You should have a lawyer present.

01:09:37.774 --> 01:09:40.988
- We're gonna have one, so...
- Just get out of my house.

01:09:45.533 --> 01:09:47.475
Get the fuck out!

01:09:51.988 --> 01:09:53.814
This isn't right.

01:09:55.627 --> 01:09:57.418
I'm sorry.

01:10:43.074 --> 01:10:46.085
We are here to ascertain
who can best take care of Jill...

01:10:46.265 --> 01:10:48.736
...in the condition she's currently in.

01:10:50.782 --> 01:10:53.066
This is about what's best for her, Bill.

01:10:53.586 --> 01:10:56.411
We love you all very much.

01:10:57.789 --> 01:11:00.112
The kids throw food down at her.

01:11:00.192 --> 01:11:03.899
They are confused they're disoriented,
they're terrified.

01:11:03.979 --> 01:11:06.944
The kids are adjusting and...

01:11:07.024 --> 01:11:09.254
...and they love her. And you know that.

01:11:09.334 --> 01:11:11.857
Of course. I know that, Bill.

01:11:11.937 --> 01:11:15.894
- Okay.
- Look, it's apparent...

01:11:15.974 --> 01:11:18.398
...that you cannot do this alone.

01:11:19.378 --> 01:11:23.462
Let us share in this burden together, okay?

01:11:23.749 --> 01:11:27.887
I have been taking the kids to school.
We've been having dinner together.

01:11:27.967 --> 01:11:29.507
It's...

01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:34.349
...it's been an understandable
learning curve but I'm getting it.

01:11:39.697 --> 01:11:42.521
I'm sorry, Bill. We have to do what's best...

01:11:42.601 --> 01:11:44.957
Okay. I know what you all think of me.

01:11:45.037 --> 01:11:50.001
And I admit, it's true.
I did not do right by Jill before, okay?

01:11:50.743 --> 01:11:52.564
But... but they're right.

01:11:52.644 --> 01:11:55.501
After the first kid I didn't change
one diaper. I didn't...

01:11:55.581 --> 01:11:58.737
I don't know any of their teachers' names.

01:11:58.817 --> 01:12:01.907
Jill knew all that stuff.
She knew everything.

01:12:01.987 --> 01:12:03.809
She thought it all out for me.

01:12:03.889 --> 01:12:06.145
She would leave little crumbs
for me, she, she...

01:12:06.225 --> 01:12:08.581
She would whisper in my ear
at a cocktail party.

01:12:08.661 --> 01:12:11.150
If someone was coming up to me,
she would say, "Malcolm..."

01:12:11.230 --> 01:12:15.089
...or whatever so I could say,
"Hey, Malcolm."

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:19.638
She... she fed me, she bought my clothes.

01:12:20.639 --> 01:12:26.665
When my dad was still alive she would
be the one to get him gifts from me.

01:12:26.745 --> 01:12:28.994
She'd write the tag, "Love, Bill."

01:12:29.074 --> 01:12:31.070
She'd get all the kids gifts, you know?

01:12:31.150 --> 01:12:34.038
All of a sudden it would be another
one of their birthdays and...

01:12:35.618 --> 01:12:39.111
...she'd have it taken care of
and she got all your guys' gifts.

01:12:39.491 --> 01:12:41.349
She even...

01:12:43.927 --> 01:12:46.371
...this is the worst part. She...

01:12:48.032 --> 01:12:50.789
On her birthday or on Christmas...

01:12:50.869 --> 01:12:53.926
...she would pick out her own gift...

01:12:54.006 --> 01:12:58.664
...from me, wrap it, right the tag,
put it under the tree...

01:12:58.744 --> 01:13:02.568
...and on Christmas morning
I would be sittin' there...

01:13:02.648 --> 01:13:06.405
...eggnog, robe on, watchin'
everybody open their gifts...

01:13:06.485 --> 01:13:10.965
...and she would come up and kiss me and...

01:13:12.023 --> 01:13:13.848
...thank me.

01:13:16.527 --> 01:13:18.618
Just kiss me on the cheek and...

01:13:19.498 --> 01:13:22.587
...thank me for her gift.

01:13:22.667 --> 01:13:24.489
"From Bill."

01:13:25.329 --> 01:13:27.161
And you know what I would do?

01:13:30.474 --> 01:13:32.297
I would fucking...

01:13:32.377 --> 01:13:34.233
...I would say, "You're welcome."

01:13:34.513 --> 01:13:37.371
And that was the deal.
It was a pretty good deal.

01:13:40.785 --> 01:13:42.336
Bill...

01:13:42.759 --> 01:13:44.567
...you could fix something here.

01:13:48.743 --> 01:13:51.350
Now, we can do this through the courts...

01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:54.088
...or we can do it right now...

01:13:55.099 --> 01:13:57.958
...as a family, together.

01:13:59.203 --> 01:14:03.228
If Jill can come
and be with you and the kids...

01:14:03.308 --> 01:14:07.669
...once every two weeks
and later on it could be more.

01:14:07.749 --> 01:14:10.171
- Yes.
- Right?

01:14:13.818 --> 01:14:17.044
Well, I'm without my wife
anyway now, you know?

01:14:19.056 --> 01:14:21.713
I mean, I'm basically alone, you know?

01:14:21.793 --> 01:14:25.653
We know that, darling, we know,
but we do care about you.

01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:30.758
Bill, you're not alone.

01:14:41.112 --> 01:14:44.172
We are leaving with Jill today.

01:14:46.083 --> 01:14:49.710
Now, you, focus on the kids.

01:14:54.492 --> 01:14:56.985
Get away! Come back!

01:15:38.403 --> 01:15:40.425
One for you.

01:15:40.505 --> 01:15:42.628
And then one for you.

01:15:42.708 --> 01:15:44.166
Do you want one?

01:15:44.576 --> 01:15:47.366
I want to see if I can give you
a piggyback ride. Hold on.

01:15:47.446 --> 01:15:50.742
- Alright.
- Hold on. Okay.

01:15:50.822 --> 01:15:53.171
- Alright, Cindy, teach me.
- What do you think?

01:15:53.251 --> 01:15:54.775
Good.

01:15:57.022 --> 01:16:00.246
Hang on tight. Okay, let's not...

01:16:00.692 --> 01:16:04.552
Oh, yeah. Do the head shake now.
I don't want you falling off. Don't do...

01:16:08.132 --> 01:16:09.454
- Alright.
- Alright.

01:16:09.534 --> 01:16:11.924
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you.

01:16:12.004 --> 01:16:14.863
- Thank you. Okay, here, teach me.
- Go.

01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:17.362
Faster. Faster.

01:16:17.442 --> 01:16:20.432
Well, it stopped up
all of the bathroom pipes.

01:16:20.512 --> 01:16:22.724
This little piece of metal.

01:16:37.929 --> 01:16:41.753
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it. Wait, you... Oh, geez!

01:16:41.833 --> 01:16:44.756
That was a close one.
Did you put my DS in here, Dad?

01:16:44.836 --> 01:16:47.659
Not in this box,
but it's in the one with your stuff.

01:16:47.739 --> 01:16:49.297
Yeah.

01:18:07.184 --> 01:18:10.277
- Okay, what are you guys going to do?
- I don't know what...

01:18:11.289 --> 01:18:13.514
It's like music to my ears.

01:18:14.692 --> 01:18:17.215
If you leave it down, it gets in my face...

01:18:17.295 --> 01:18:20.986
...and I can't play or eat, so...

01:18:21.066 --> 01:18:23.021
'Cause it gets in your mouth. Alright.

01:18:23.101 --> 01:18:26.224
Mom always puts it in a...
puts it in a puff for me.

01:18:26.304 --> 01:18:27.993
Okay.

01:18:28.073 --> 01:18:32.330
Alright, then you go take me to the mall
and I'll go pick up Tiff's sheet music...

01:18:32.410 --> 01:18:34.933
...and then you'll pick Cindy up
from soccer and then you'll come get me.

01:18:35.013 --> 01:18:37.402
Go to the mall, then soccer
then the mall. Okay, I got it.

01:18:37.482 --> 01:18:40.639
- Dad, do you have a four?
- No. Go fish.

01:18:40.719 --> 01:18:42.507
- Oh, no!
- Oh, man!

01:18:42.587 --> 01:18:45.243
- Go fish! Did you get a four?
- No.

01:18:45.323 --> 01:18:48.180
- I think I'm winning. Yeah.
- Okay, you're winning?

01:18:48.260 --> 01:18:52.550
- I, for sure, am losing.
- Dad, do you have a ten?

01:18:55.399 --> 01:18:57.656
Yes. Another match.

01:18:57.936 --> 01:18:59.057
- Alright.
- My turn?

01:18:59.137 --> 01:19:01.994
- Yeah, your turn.
- Does anyone have...

01:19:02.074 --> 01:19:05.130
No, you have to ask a specific person.

01:19:08.063 --> 01:19:10.358
Who do you want? Tiffany, Max, Dad?

01:19:10.438 --> 01:19:12.005
Tiffany.

01:19:19.857 --> 01:19:23.315
Tiff, are you okay? Is it time for school?

01:19:23.395 --> 01:19:25.650
No. It's, it's like, 11:00.

01:19:25.730 --> 01:19:29.198
- Oh, my gosh! My alarm didn't go off.
- Dad, it's Saturday.

01:19:34.672 --> 01:19:36.529
Max said that...

01:19:37.509 --> 01:19:39.767
...that I should show you my...

01:19:48.652 --> 01:19:51.879
Hey, hey, hey,
it's okay, it's okay. Here, sit.

01:19:53.524 --> 01:19:55.326
What is this?

01:19:55.637 --> 01:19:57.704
Is this your report card?

01:19:58.847 --> 01:20:00.919
- Yeah.
- For my Tiffany.

01:20:00.999 --> 01:20:03.856
Am I lucky a dad to get to see this or what?

01:20:04.736 --> 01:20:07.192
- Okay, what is this?
- I...

01:20:07.272 --> 01:20:09.497
...I got all As in everything.

01:20:11.243 --> 01:20:13.934
- Even in Spanish?
- Yeah.

01:20:14.662 --> 01:20:18.761
Tiff, I am so proud of you.

01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:21.376
Thank you.

01:20:22.386 --> 01:20:25.443
We have to show this to Aunt Beth
when she comes tomorrow.

01:20:25.523 --> 01:20:28.983
No, I... well, I just wanted you to see it.

01:20:32.196 --> 01:20:33.787
Okay.

01:20:34.698 --> 01:20:36.223
Cool.

01:20:57.186 --> 01:20:59.010
Welcome to the new apartment.

01:20:59.090 --> 01:21:02.378
It's... it's not much, but... but we love it.

01:21:02.727 --> 01:21:05.717
Oh, yeah, that's for you
if you feel like painting.

01:21:05.797 --> 01:21:08.455
I wasn't sure if you wanted oil-based or...

01:21:09.466 --> 01:21:11.556
- Go ahead, kids, say hi. It's your mom.
- Hi, Mom.

01:21:11.636 --> 01:21:13.894
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey, Mom.

01:21:15.839 --> 01:21:18.263
Okay, so, honey...

01:21:18.343 --> 01:21:23.237
...the kids are gonna stay at Beth's tonight.
So, it'll just be the two of us, okay?

01:21:24.415 --> 01:21:26.104
- Okay.
- Ready?

01:21:26.184 --> 01:21:28.473
- It's gonna be so much fun.
- What are we doing tonight?

01:21:28.553 --> 01:21:30.712
- Have fun, guys.
- Let's play some dice.

01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:39.120
See you guys. Thank you.

01:22:25.008 --> 01:22:28.269
Okay, Jill, here we are.

01:22:30.347 --> 01:22:33.432
You wanna come out and meet some friends?

01:22:36.653 --> 01:22:38.478
You okay?

01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:44.985
Okay.

01:23:15.693 --> 01:23:17.251
Okay?

01:23:18.529 --> 01:23:20.452
Here we are.

01:23:20.532 --> 01:23:22.456
You can go ahead.

01:23:32.943 --> 01:23:35.639
Look... look at all the little...

01:23:35.719 --> 01:23:37.390
...friends.

01:23:44.721 --> 01:23:46.613
It's okay.

01:23:47.124 --> 01:23:49.182
It's okay. You could just...

01:23:49.393 --> 01:23:51.251
Here, like this.

01:23:53.630 --> 01:23:55.489
Like this.

01:23:59.670 --> 01:24:01.195
Woof.

01:24:02.473 --> 01:24:04.064
Woof.

01:26:56.747 --> 01:26:58.305
Jill?

01:27:02.486 --> 01:27:03.994
Where you goin'?

01:27:06.657 --> 01:27:08.548
Where are you goin'?

01:27:10.594 --> 01:27:12.119
Jill?

01:27:15.065 --> 01:27:16.656
Hi.

01:27:17.701 --> 01:27:19.527
What are you doin'?

01:27:20.537 --> 01:27:22.827
You wanna get washed? Here.

01:27:23.407 --> 01:27:25.466
I can clean you up a little bit.

01:27:28.111 --> 01:27:29.670
Okay?

01:27:31.916 --> 01:27:33.807
Here you go.

01:27:34.652 --> 01:27:37.677
Jesus. Jill, relax, okay?

01:27:38.256 --> 01:27:40.754
Hey, it's just water.

01:27:41.449 --> 01:27:43.035
Okay?

01:27:53.784 --> 01:27:55.572
It's okay.

01:28:26.203 --> 01:28:27.794
Jill.

01:28:29.339 --> 01:28:32.163
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:28:32.243 --> 01:28:36.701
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
No, no. It's okay. It's okay.

01:28:36.781 --> 01:28:38.871
Jill. Jill, Jill.

01:28:39.250 --> 01:28:43.241
It's okay. It's okay. Listen, you're okay.
I love you. I love you.

01:28:43.321 --> 01:28:46.726
You can be whatever you need to be, okay?

01:28:46.806 --> 01:28:48.613
Just please don't leave me.

01:28:48.693 --> 01:28:52.483
Okay? It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

01:28:52.563 --> 01:28:57.023
It's okay. Just stay.
Just stay here. Just stay.

01:28:57.869 --> 01:28:59.692
It's okay.

01:28:59.971 --> 01:29:02.462
Stay. Stay.

01:29:06.369 --> 01:29:08.802
Okay. It's okay.

01:29:10.415 --> 01:29:12.305
It's okay.

01:29:12.784 --> 01:29:14.608
It's okay.

01:29:25.262 --> 01:29:28.788
I love you no matter what.
You can be whatever you need to be.

01:29:30.601 --> 01:29:32.626
And I'm not going anywhere.

01:29:38.408 --> 01:29:40.867
Jill. Jill.

01:29:57.728 --> 01:30:00.353
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

01:30:00.932 --> 01:30:04.122
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

01:30:04.202 --> 01:30:06.224
It's okay. It's all okay.

01:30:06.304 --> 01:30:09.594
It's all okay. It's okay.

01:30:09.674 --> 01:30:12.332
It's alright, honey, you're here now.

01:30:13.177 --> 01:30:15.001
It's okay.

01:30:15.812 --> 01:30:18.271
It's okay. It's okay.

01:30:22.919 --> 01:30:24.811
You stay here with me.

01:32:05.423 --> 01:32:08.246
- Don't do it so fast!
- Alright, you ready?

01:32:08.326 --> 01:32:10.848
- So, it's one, two...
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:32:10.928 --> 01:32:13.420
- We're so good at this.
- Okay.

01:32:14.164 --> 01:32:16.056
How do you do it?

01:32:24.274 --> 01:32:28.168
You did it again. Alright.
Come on, let's not do it fast. Alright.

01:32:28.812 --> 01:32:30.703
Wait, wait.

01:32:36.987 --> 01:32:39.210
- Oh, do you clap in between?
- Yeah.

01:32:39.290 --> 01:32:42.350
- I've been telling you that the entire time.
- Move, I'm...

01:32:46.296 --> 01:32:49.589
- Why are your knuckles so hard?
- Okay, I know what's in it.

01:32:58.260 --> 01:33:00.131
This is so intense!

01:33:00.611 --> 01:33:02.733
That's 'cause we're really,
we're really, like...

01:33:02.813 --> 01:33:05.238
...punching each other or, the, slapping...
