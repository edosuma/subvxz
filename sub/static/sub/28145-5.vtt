JENNY HOLDS SHAKY LAST NOTE

00:40.240 --> 00:41.240
Lovely.

00:42.560 --> 00:44.560
And I believe you wrote the lyrics
yourselves.

00:44.600 --> 00:45.960
Is that correct?

00:46.000 --> 00:47.120
It is indeed, Sister.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.960
Do you ever think you might have too
much time on your hands, girls?

00:51.760 --> 00:52.880
Lose the jackets.

00:55.280 --> 00:57.640
OK, just a couple of things.

00:57.680 --> 01:01.600
Firstly, I'd like to introduce Mae
Cheung.

01:01.640 --> 01:03.360
Can you make yourself known, please,
Mae?

01:03.400 --> 01:06.720
Miss Cheung's family have recently
moved here to Derry

01:06.760 --> 01:09.320
so I hope you'll all make her feel
very welcome.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.280
It's bound to be a bit of a culture
shock, Mae.

01:11.320 --> 01:13.960
Things are done...differently in
this part of the world.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.480
But I'm sure you'll soon feel as at
home here as you did

01:17.520 --> 01:19.960
back in your beloved Donegal.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.360
Announcement from Jenny Joyce and
the dance committee.

01:24.400 --> 01:27.120
"The school social event of the year
is fast approaching,

01:27.160 --> 01:30.720
"but before you don your glad

01:34.360 --> 01:36.240
I'm sorry, I simply cannot read
this.

But before you don your glad rags

01:40.920 --> 01:43.080
and boogie on down,

we'd like to let you in on our
little secret.

We're not actually going to have a
school formal this year.

Wise up!

02:02.880 --> 02:05.240
I know, I know.
But I do love a theme.

02:05.280 --> 02:08.120
Sure, isn't that why people call me
the Theme Queen?

02:08.160 --> 02:09.600
Do they fuck.

02:09.639 --> 02:12.840
We want it to have a real
old-school, retro, vintage vibe.

02:12.880 --> 02:15.440
So, feel free to just go for it!

02:15.480 --> 02:17.000

02:25.160 --> 02:26.520
There she is.

02:26.560 --> 02:28.920
OK, so I say we just go over there
and be ourselves, girls.

02:28.960 --> 02:30.680
Well, not totally ourselves.

02:30.720 --> 02:32.640
We should definitely be a bit
ourselves.

02:32.680 --> 02:35.040
We could also pretend we're sort of
better than we actually are.

02:35.080 --> 02:36.920
So, I suppose what I'm saying is,
we could present

02:36.960 --> 02:39.200
a version of ourselves that's
less... Precisely.

02:39.240 --> 02:41.480
Why do we even have to talk to her?
Because she's new, Michelle!

02:41.520 --> 02:42.880
Urgh! I hate people I don't know.

02:42.920 --> 02:45.280
And, in case you hadn't noticed, she
also happens to be Chinese.

02:45.320 --> 02:47.320
I mean, how class would it be to
have a Chinese friend?!

02:47.360 --> 02:48.640
We could keep her in my toy box.

02:48.680 --> 02:49.760
No, we couldn't, Orla.

02:49.800 --> 02:50.920
Oh, she'd definitely fit.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.200
That is not the point.

02:52.240 --> 02:55.800
Fine, but can we agree it's
on a strict one-in, one-out basis?

02:55.840 --> 02:57.800
If she joins the group, James has to
leave.

02:57.840 --> 02:59.720
Absolutely.

02:59.760 --> 03:00.880
Excuse me?

03:00.920 --> 03:03.880
SHE SPEAKS CANTONESE

03:07.880 --> 03:09.080
Is she all right?

03:09.120 --> 03:10.240
Burning for you, Clare.

03:10.280 --> 03:11.320
I-It's Cantonese.

03:11.360 --> 03:14.360
Right, well, I'm from Donegal and
we speak English there.

03:14.400 --> 03:17.160
If you say so, Mae, but I spent the
summer in Killybegs

03:17.200 --> 03:19.080
and, seriously? Not a fucking word.

03:19.120 --> 03:21.120
We just wanted to introduce
ourselves and...

03:21.160 --> 03:23.920
OK, I think I see where this is
going. I get this a lot.

03:23.960 --> 03:27.680
Dull white girls wanting me to join
their gang because...well...

03:27.720 --> 03:29.400
Sure.

03:29.440 --> 03:30.760
And I'm actually a boy.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.080
Whoa, she has a really fucked-up
accent.

03:33.120 --> 03:34.120
We know.

03:35.240 --> 03:37.640
What's in this for me? What are you
bringing to the table?

03:37.680 --> 03:39.120
Cream crackers?

03:39.160 --> 03:41.800
I'm good for cream crackers,
thank you.

03:41.840 --> 03:43.840
I'll see you around, girls.

03:43.880 --> 03:46.640
Maybe we don't need a Chinese
person, we've already got a lesbian.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.760
Me.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.280
Really? You don't look like a
lesbian. What do you mean?

03:51.320 --> 03:53.120
Just that you're a bit...short.

03:53.160 --> 03:55.160
Well, there's no height
restrictions.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.320
As far as I'm aware.

03:56.360 --> 03:57.640
Interesting.

03:57.680 --> 03:59.120
I've always wanted a gay friend.

03:59.160 --> 04:00.960
I mean, ideally a fella, but...

04:01.000 --> 04:02.480
Howdy, folks!

04:02.520 --> 04:03.680
Christ.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.320
I'm Jenny, this is Aisling,

04:05.360 --> 04:07.640
we just thought we'd introduce
ourselves and see if...

04:07.680 --> 04:10.000
I see.

04:10.040 --> 04:13.120
Look, these girls are great
but I do have a pen pal

04:13.160 --> 04:18.120
from the Caribbean, so perhaps my
circle is a little bit more diverse?

04:18.160 --> 04:20.000
Back. Off.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.240
Think it over. Give me a call.

04:22.280 --> 04:25.520
Oh, and FYI, the prom queen vote
closes today.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.160
FY nobody gives a shit.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.560
Here's the wee ballot.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.760
I see you've thrown your hat into
the ring, Jenny.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.320
I had my arm twisted.

04:32.360 --> 04:34.680
But feel free to tick my box.

04:34.720 --> 04:36.040
Dirty bitch.

04:37.080 --> 04:39.520
Well, this prom's going to be
a full-blown dick fest.

04:39.560 --> 04:41.440
You know there isn't even going to
be a DJ?

04:41.480 --> 04:42.760
Apparently Jenny's hired

04:42.800 --> 04:44.320
this fucking pensioner band.

04:44.360 --> 04:45.520
Christ. Really?

04:45.560 --> 04:47.480
I heard the drummer is at least 30!

04:47.520 --> 04:49.480
I don't feel so bad
about missing it now.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.240
It clashes with my thing.

04:51.280 --> 04:52.800
The creep convention? Seriously?

04:52.840 --> 04:54.440
It's not a creep convention.

04:54.480 --> 04:56.960
Well, I think a load of perverts
getting together to wank over some

04:57.000 --> 05:00.240
fella, who fights with hoovers and
rides aliens in a telephone box,

05:00.280 --> 05:03.000
is the very fucking definition of a
creep convention.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.400
It's a Doctor Who night.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.480
Me and my stepdad used to watch it
when I was little.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.480
Well, someone should have called
social services!

05:08.520 --> 05:10.760
You're not going to the prom, then,
James?

05:10.800 --> 05:13.200
Well, I was going to ask you
to be my date.

05:13.240 --> 05:14.840
I'm sorry, Clare.

05:14.880 --> 05:17.000
You were going to ask James to be
your date?

05:17.040 --> 05:18.280
What the fuck's wrong with you?

05:18.320 --> 05:20.080
Well, it's a bit more complicated
for me.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.920
You're a lesbian, Clare,
not desperate.

05:21.960 --> 05:23.440
Now, I don't know who to ask.

05:23.480 --> 05:24.520
Tell me about it.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.760
There's at least five fellas that
fancy the arse off me

05:26.800 --> 05:27.800
but I just can't choose.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.160
Yeah, that's definitely the same.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.400
I'll be your date, Clare.

05:30.440 --> 05:33.120
But, Erin, people might talk, they
might get the wrong idea.

05:33.160 --> 05:35.440
Let them! We need to break down
these ridiculous conventions.

05:35.480 --> 05:36.840
Are you sure?

05:36.880 --> 05:38.560
I'd be proud to have you on my arm.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.160
Oh, God.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.840
John Paul's over there.

05:41.880 --> 05:44.040
Christ, but it's been so awkward
since we broke up.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.120
For fuck sake, Erin.

05:45.160 --> 05:47.560
He kissed you on the cheek at
Kerry Coyle's 16th birthday party

05:47.600 --> 05:49.760
and then passed out in a puddle
of his own boke.

05:49.800 --> 05:52.160
Yeah. He missed the boat, all right.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.400
I'm sure the fact that he's poking a
model

05:54.440 --> 05:55.880
is some consolation.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.440
OK. Cara is not a model.

05:57.480 --> 05:58.720
She's done SOME modelling.

05:58.760 --> 05:59.840
There's a difference.

05:59.880 --> 06:01.360
I heard she's gonna be on Baywatch.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.520
She's not going to be on Baywatch,
Orla. I heard that, too.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.120
So did I.

06:05.160 --> 06:07.080
They don't have people from Derry
on Baywatch, OK?

06:07.120 --> 06:08.320
We're just too pasty.

06:08.360 --> 06:10.840
Look, it was never going to work
out between me and John Paul.

06:10.880 --> 06:12.240
I realise that now.

06:12.280 --> 06:14.320
Because I'm looking for an
intellectual connection

06:14.360 --> 06:15.920
To ride a model?

06:15.960 --> 06:18.000
Oh, my God!
What?

06:18.040 --> 06:19.400
It looks like they're breaking up!

06:19.440 --> 06:21.280
Why?!

06:21.320 --> 06:22.480
Jesus, are they really?

06:22.520 --> 06:24.000
Are they breaking up?

06:25.320 --> 06:27.080
They are! They're breaking up.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.360
This is class.

06:28.400 --> 06:29.800
Later!

06:29.840 --> 06:31.160
Erin? What are you doing?!

06:31.200 --> 06:32.880
She has no respect for herself.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.000
And coming from me...

06:34.040 --> 06:35.520
Exactly.

06:36.640 --> 06:38.160
Hey.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.440
Hey.

06:39.480 --> 06:40.680
Jesus Christ!

06:40.720 --> 06:41.880
Sorry.

06:41.920 --> 06:43.200
What happened there was...

06:43.240 --> 06:44.760
..well, I slightly misjudged

06:44.800 --> 06:46.400
the level of my own voice, I think.

06:46.440 --> 06:49.000
You're grand, I was in a world
of my own.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.440
Yeah, yeah.

06:51.480 --> 06:52.720
Oh, yeah.

06:52.760 --> 06:55.480
Really? It's just, well, I couldn't
help but notice that you

06:55.520 --> 06:58.080
and Cara were, sort of,
breaking up a bit, there.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.120
Yeah.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.640
Really?

07:02.680 --> 07:04.440
It was mutual.

07:04.480 --> 07:05.960
It was definitely a mutual thing.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.320
Although, maybe she wanted to
mutually split up a bit more

07:09.360 --> 07:10.480
I see.

07:10.520 --> 07:12.960
Now I'm just not sure it was the
right decision.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.280
It definitely was.

07:14.320 --> 07:16.440
We just got each other, you know?

07:16.480 --> 07:19.120
I mean, she's so cool and smart.

07:19.160 --> 07:20.520
Smart? Really?

07:20.560 --> 07:22.200
And she's a model, for Christ's
sake.

07:22.240 --> 07:23.440
She's done SOME modelling.

07:23.480 --> 07:25.440
I'm just wondering whether I should
go after her

07:25.480 --> 07:27.640
You
definitely shouldn't do that.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.200
Yeah, it's needy.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.320
What you should do is take your mind
off it.

07:31.360 --> 07:33.000
OK. Cool.

07:33.040 --> 07:34.320
Sweet.

07:34.360 --> 07:35.480
How?

07:35.520 --> 07:36.720
Go out with me.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.080
I mean, go out with us.

07:38.120 --> 07:41.400
Me my friends, we're going to this
prom thing on Saturday night.

07:41.440 --> 07:43.040
A prom? Sounds sort of...

07:43.080 --> 07:44.280
..formal.

07:44.320 --> 07:47.080
Oh, no, it's not. It's actually not
at all.

07:47.120 --> 07:48.920
It's actually very informal.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.480
It's actually really, like,
laid-back, chilled,

07:51.520 --> 07:53.120
"who gives an F" kind of thing.

07:53.160 --> 07:55.400
It's not a big deal. It's not a big
deal at all.

07:58.320 --> 07:59.880
This is a huge deal.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.000
This is a massive, massive deal.

08:02.040 --> 08:04.560
I'm going to the prom with John Paul
O'Reily, for God's sake.

08:04.600 --> 08:05.880
Oh, come on, Mammy.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.720
I don't care if you're going to the
prom

08:07.760 --> 08:09.000
with John Paul II, Erin.

08:09.040 --> 08:11.080
I'm not buying you another frock.
End of story.

08:11.120 --> 08:12.560
But, Mammy, you don't understand.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.480
There's nothing wrong with your
Easter dress.

08:14.520 --> 08:16.440
There is lots of things wrong with
my Easter dress.

08:16.480 --> 08:17.480
I mean, it matches Orla's.

08:17.520 --> 08:18.760
That being the main one.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.880
Honestly, Erin, I think we'll look
so cracker

08:20.920 --> 08:22.320
if we both rock in wearing these.

08:22.360 --> 08:23.520
Right.

08:23.560 --> 08:24.560
Well, I don't.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.800
Och, Mary, you'd think the wean's
been dropped into it.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.480
You wouldn't nip it in a bit for
her?

08:28.520 --> 08:31.160
I'd do it myself but sewing plays
havoc with my acrylics.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.320
Fine.

08:32.360 --> 08:33.880
I really like this fella, Mammy.

08:33.919 --> 08:36.200
Well, if he really likes you, it
won't matter what you wear.

08:36.240 --> 08:37.440
Och, come off it!

08:37.480 --> 08:38.720
Have you a date lined up, Orla?

08:38.760 --> 08:39.960
I do, aye.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.080
What?

08:41.120 --> 08:42.200
With, like, a human?

08:42.240 --> 08:43.760
Yeah.

08:43.799 --> 08:47.360
This document is an insult to the
majority of people

08:47.400 --> 08:48.680
of Northern Ireland!

08:48.720 --> 08:50.800
All right, Ian, we get the idea,
like.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.040
What are you footering at?

08:57.080 --> 08:59.160
The picture's just gone a bit, sort
of...

08:59.200 --> 09:00.440
Dear Jesus!

09:00.480 --> 09:02.480
You have to give it a bit of a shock
now and again.

09:02.520 --> 09:03.920
You have to keep it on its toes.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.000
I'm not sure you do have to keep
it on its toes, Joe.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.240
It's a television.

09:08.400 --> 09:09.720
OK, OK, OK!

09:10.840 --> 09:12.560
I'm just going to turn it off
and turn it on again.

09:12.600 --> 09:14.480
That usually does the trick.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.880
There we go. Hm?

09:17.920 --> 09:20.040
It doesn't seem to be doing
anything, now.

09:20.080 --> 09:22.840
This stupid prick's broken the TV,
Mary!

09:22.880 --> 09:24.440
For God's sake, Gerry.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.600
He's been footering.

09:25.640 --> 09:26.840
Excuse me.

09:26.880 --> 09:29.120
You're the one that was thumping it
repeatedly, Joe.

09:29.160 --> 09:30.560
I'll thump YOU repeatedly.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.240
Well, the pair of you better sort
it out.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.880
London's Burning's on in 20 minutes.

09:33.920 --> 09:37.200
God, Mary, but them poor fellas are
flat out with fires, so they are.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.760
Jesus, but they never get a minute.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.920
Aye, it's a good job they keep
themselves in such great shape.

09:42.960 --> 09:44.280
Aw, don't, Mary.

09:44.320 --> 09:45.360
That Greek fella...

09:45.400 --> 09:47.520
He could throw me over his shoulder
any day of the week.

09:47.560 --> 09:48.760
Boke-o-rama.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.480
I hate to do this, Clare.

09:52.520 --> 09:53.640
I've said it's fine.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.040
I'm happy for you.

09:56.080 --> 09:58.600
OK. It's just, you don't sound happy
for me. Well, I am.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.880
I'm over the moon.

09:59.920 --> 10:01.240
Great, because me and John Paul

10:01.280 --> 10:03.480
are just at a really crucial point
in our relationship.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.640
You've strong-armed him into taking
you to the prom, Erin.

10:05.680 --> 10:07.440
Doesn't mean you're in a
relationship.

10:07.480 --> 10:09.040
Hiya!

10:09.080 --> 10:11.000
So, this is where the gays hang out,
is it?

10:11.040 --> 10:12.520
What's happening?

10:12.560 --> 10:14.560
Erin's just sacked Clare as her prom
date so she can take

10:14.600 --> 10:15.640
a fella she fancies.

10:15.680 --> 10:17.200
Bad craic, Erin. Very bad craic.

10:17.240 --> 10:19.040
Isn't it?

10:19.080 --> 10:21.600
Well, I mean, there is some truth in
it. Come with me.

10:21.640 --> 10:23.280
Really.

10:23.320 --> 10:24.480
It'll be a laugh.

10:24.520 --> 10:26.280
And I'm definitely an upgrade.

10:26.320 --> 10:27.440
Just a wee joke, there.

10:27.480 --> 10:29.080
Yeah, it was. It was dead funny.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.840
Sounds good to me.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.720
Great! All sorted.

10:32.760 --> 10:35.360
OK, now that Mae has officially
joined the group,

10:35.400 --> 10:37.080
we need to give James his notice.

10:37.120 --> 10:38.200
What?

10:38.240 --> 10:41.400
I personally think a week's more
than generous. Me, too.

10:41.440 --> 10:42.520
Orla!

10:42.560 --> 10:43.880
Oh, I'm sorry, James,

Definitely the pink.

There's big Johnny Kells who
works in Dunnes.

11:46.320 --> 11:48.680
Thick as fuck,
but a massive, massive ride.

11:48.720 --> 11:51.000
Then there's this other fella,
he's not as thick, but he's also

11:51.040 --> 11:53.200
not as hot, although I have heard

11:53.240 --> 11:54.960
he is really good with his hands.

16:53.650 --> 16:55.530
Why isn't anyone dancing?

16:55.570 --> 16:57.810
How're you supposed to dance
to this old shite?

16:57.850 --> 16:59.570
Come on, Orla. We'll show them.

17:01.810 --> 17:03.650

17:21.369 --> 17:22.730
Jesus Christ!

17:22.770 --> 17:24.970
They're talking to
each other now.

17:25.010 --> 17:27.210
They're actually fucking talking
to each other!

17:27.250 --> 17:28.850
That's right.

17:28.890 --> 17:30.410
Hi, I'm Kris.

17:30.450 --> 17:31.850
I'm here with Tara Martin.

17:31.890 --> 17:33.130
She's...

17:33.170 --> 17:35.690
Oh, God, where's she gone?

17:35.730 --> 17:37.450
Tall, blonde, wears glasses?

17:37.490 --> 17:39.650
Ah, Trampy Tara?

17:39.690 --> 17:41.770
We've just started seeing
each other, actually.

17:41.810 --> 17:44.770
Oh, no, not that kind of trampy.

17:44.810 --> 17:48.530
No, we just call her that because
she's got quite a heavy...gait.

17:48.570 --> 17:50.130
You should listen out for it.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.290
Anyway, what can I do for you?

17:52.330 --> 17:54.570
Well, I see you're hanging out
with Mae?

17:54.610 --> 17:57.850
So, I know Mae
from back home. From China?!

17:57.890 --> 17:59.570
No, Donegal.

17:59.610 --> 18:00.930
Yes. Right. Sorry.

18:00.970 --> 18:03.250
No worries.
Yeah, Mae went to my school.

18:03.290 --> 18:06.410
Did she ever tell you why she had to
leave? HAD to leave?

18:10.330 --> 18:15.690
# You could say this was

18:15.730 --> 18:18.410

I'm gonna go and change.

18:32.130 --> 18:34.250
Maybe leave it another few minutes?

18:34.290 --> 18:36.010
I want to get out of this thing.

The lads, they worked it out.
They've gone to the pub.

19:46.610 --> 19:48.930
Look, there's a guy here,
he knows Mae and...

19:48.970 --> 19:51.650
Aw, don't tell me.
Wank Features stood you up?

19:51.690 --> 19:54.330
I'm sorry, Erin.
No, I'm sorry.

19:54.370 --> 19:56.130
You were right. I was jealous.

19:56.170 --> 19:59.250
Mae's just so cool and exotic and
you liked her so much and...

19:59.290 --> 20:00.650
What?

20:00.690 --> 20:03.370
I met this guy that went to her
school, he said she had to

20:03.410 --> 20:06.210
leave for, like, being a bully. He
said she's seriously unhinged!

20:06.250 --> 20:08.410
I think he's a bit pissed off
with her, to be honest,

20:08.450 --> 20:11.090
and I can't blame him cos she's
giving the Chinese population

20:11.130 --> 20:14.050
in Donegal a really bad rap.
Typical Donegal man. Always moaning.

20:15.210 --> 20:17.450
What's she doing?

20:17.490 --> 20:20.330
She was talking about how she wasn't
gonna let Jenny get away with

20:20.370 --> 20:22.530
the whole prom Queen thing.
Jesus Christ, look!

20:22.570 --> 20:25.890
Above the stage, look! She's not
gonna do a Carrie! Fuck-a-doodle-do!

20:25.930 --> 20:28.490
What's a Carrie? What does
that mean? You've never seen Carrie?

20:28.530 --> 20:30.330
Aw, it's some film, Clare.
Amazing.

20:30.370 --> 20:32.090
Aye, you should check it out.

20:32.130 --> 20:35.450
Expand and explain!
EXPAND AND EXPLAIN!

20:35.490 --> 20:37.370
So, Carrie is voted Prom Queen

20:37.410 --> 20:40.890
and this bully pours a bucket of
pig's blood on her. Jesus Christ!

20:40.930 --> 20:42.850
I mean, lots of other stuff
happens, too,

20:42.890 --> 20:44.970
but that's the, sort of,
relevant bit.

20:45.010 --> 20:47.210
Can I have your attention, please?

20:47.250 --> 20:50.210
And, now, the moment we've all
been waiting for...

20:50.250 --> 20:53.210
..it's time to crown our Prom Queen.

20:53.250 --> 20:54.570
Holy shit!

20:54.610 --> 20:56.770
How long are we supposed
to go on like this, Gerry?

20:56.810 --> 21:00.090
We've already
missed Coronation Street.

21:00.130 --> 21:02.650
Well, every cloud, as they say.
I've warned you before, Gerry.

21:02.690 --> 21:04.650
You say another bad word about
Coronation Street

21:04.690 --> 21:06.530
and you may leave this house
and never return.

21:06.570 --> 21:08.490
And you'd have my full backing
on that, Mary.

21:08.530 --> 21:10.090
God only knows what else we've
missed.

21:10.130 --> 21:11.930
We won't have missed anything.

TV TURNS ON

21:13.530 --> 21:14.530
Yes!

21:14.570 --> 21:16.770
And tonight's main story again.

21:16.810 --> 21:19.530
A historic evening
for Northern Ireland.

21:19.570 --> 21:22.410
As of midnight tonight,
after 25 years,

21:22.450 --> 21:25.490
the IRA have called a ceasefire.

21:25.530 --> 21:28.170
In a statement released earlier
this evening, they said

21:28.210 --> 21:31.570
there would be a "complete cessation
of all military operations".

21:31.610 --> 21:33.410
What did I tell you?

21:33.450 --> 21:34.970
Aye, well done, Gerry.

21:36.450 --> 21:38.970
And our Prom Queen is...

21:42.170 --> 21:43.770
..Jenny Joyce!

21:56.490 --> 21:58.570
I would just like to
say a few words.

21:58.610 --> 22:00.650
Firstly, this is such an honour!

22:00.690 --> 22:03.050
Piss off, Clare!

22:05.330 --> 22:07.650
Lovely words, Jenny, well done!

22:08.730 --> 22:10.690
Come on, Jenny. Don't milk it, now.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.130
Get off her! What is this?

22:12.170 --> 22:13.930
Bite my eye! Traitor!

22:13.970 --> 22:15.290
Have you ever seen Carrie?

22:29.450 --> 22:31.650
It's pig's blood. It's pig's blood!

22:31.690 --> 22:33.330
No, I think it's Tomato juice.

22:33.370 --> 22:35.010
What the fuck am I supposed to do?

22:35.050 --> 22:36.730
They'll never take this back, now!

22:36.770 --> 22:38.770
