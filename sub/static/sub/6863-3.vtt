WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:03.671
I sublet the carriage house
to my cousin Lynly.

00:03.771 --> 00:06.274
Now, if you so much
as flirt with her,
I will remove your arms.

00:06.374 --> 00:08.609
Just call me
"Chick from last night."

00:08.709 --> 00:10.010
Uh, Chick, I made you some eggs.

00:10.111 --> 00:10.711
What's wrong, Lynly?

00:10.811 --> 00:12.413
I met a guy.
He made me eggs.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.048
But he said he doesn't want
to see me again.

00:14.148 --> 00:16.050
We need a favor.
A favor?

00:16.149 --> 00:18.119
I was hoping
you would tutor her.
Of course.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.753
All right, each of you
are here because

00:19.853 --> 00:21.289
your contempt for
our neighbors to the north.

00:21.389 --> 00:24.058
I hate you, but I hate
Fillmore more.
Exactly.

00:24.158 --> 00:27.128
You are supposed to be gone.
This practice is mine now.

00:27.228 --> 00:28.229
I have the e-mail to prove it.

00:28.329 --> 00:29.730
Of course it is.
I am just here

00:29.830 --> 00:31.031
to see how you are.

00:31.132 --> 00:32.165
Stay away from my patients,

00:32.266 --> 00:33.501
or I'll get a restraining order.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.569
I am the only doctor in town.

00:35.669 --> 00:37.271
I thought I banned you.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.039
I'm here as a girlfriend,
not doctor.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.412
You really don't see
a pattern here?

00:44.512 --> 00:47.047
All I said was that
you might have sleep apnea.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.082
I heard snoring.

00:49.049 --> 00:49.717
Yesterday you wanted
to check me for scoliosis,

00:50.484 --> 00:52.186
the day before that,
dengue fever.

00:53.421 --> 00:54.188
Look, you don't have to be
overweight to have sleep apnea.

00:55.055 --> 00:55.489
You could have
a deformed epiglottis.

00:56.590 --> 00:57.525
(chuckles)
Come on. If you
love me, you'll let me

00:58.459 --> 00:59.360
just take one little
peek down your throat.

01:00.494 --> 01:01.695
All right, all right,
this is a family establishment.

01:01.795 --> 01:02.796
You can take the flashlight

01:03.797 --> 01:04.565
and the dirty talk
back to the Whippoorwill.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.467
Two Alabama Omelettes.

01:06.567 --> 01:07.701
Are these egg whites?

01:07.801 --> 01:08.802
'Cause, you know, I...

01:09.803 --> 01:10.604
Yeah, yeah, egg whites
from free-range chickens

01:11.605 --> 01:13.274
raised up on the Upper West Side
of Manhattan.

01:13.374 --> 01:16.076
Went to all the best schools.
Enjoy.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.411
Well, that never gets old.

01:17.511 --> 01:20.080
Okay, come on, just
one look? Say "Ah."

01:20.181 --> 01:22.816
Zoe, sweetie,

01:22.916 --> 01:24.485
you need to go back to work.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.220
I know.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.821
It's just that we've
been here a while,

01:27.921 --> 01:30.391
and you don't seem
any closer to finding
gainful employment.

01:30.491 --> 01:32.660
No, but I am. I've spent
the last couple weeks enacting

01:32.760 --> 01:35.463
a genius two-pronged plan
to get Brick to hire me back.

01:35.563 --> 01:36.564
I'm intrigued.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.132
Prong one: butter him up!

01:38.232 --> 01:39.767
Every day I stop by his office,

01:39.867 --> 01:41.669
bring him a pastry,
say, "Hey."

01:41.769 --> 01:42.836
Prong two:

01:43.837 --> 01:44.838
Every lunch hour,
I schmooze the good people

01:45.806 --> 01:47.375
of BlueBell right in
Brick's line of vision.

01:48.442 --> 01:49.377
Why? So Brick knows you're
not missing any meals?

01:50.311 --> 01:53.113
So he can remember
the good rapport I have

01:53.214 --> 01:54.582
with my former patients.

01:54.682 --> 01:56.116
Slowly, an idea will form,

01:56.217 --> 01:57.251
take root.

01:58.252 --> 01:59.119
Then one night, he will
have a realization:

01:59.953 --> 02:01.622
"Zoe Hart could open
her own practice

02:01.722 --> 02:02.756
and steal my patients!"

02:02.856 --> 02:04.525
Soon after that,
he's gonna ask me back.

02:04.625 --> 02:05.659
So what do you think?

02:05.759 --> 02:07.195
Well, I think I can reduce

02:07.295 --> 02:09.229
your two-pronged approach
to a single prong.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.299
Why don't you open
your own practice?

02:11.399 --> 02:11.832
What?

02:11.932 --> 02:13.167
No, no.

02:13.267 --> 02:14.735
I don't want my own...

02:14.835 --> 02:16.170
The whole point of this

02:17.305 --> 02:18.172
is for me to get back
into that practice.

02:19.139 --> 02:19.873
Yeah, but Brick doesn't have
to know that.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.175
If he's so scared,

02:22.142 --> 02:22.510
threaten to go into business
for yourself.

02:23.411 --> 02:24.278
We have to do things
the Southern way.

02:25.078 --> 02:25.679
Trust me.
It's already working.

02:26.947 --> 02:28.682
Even if it seems like it's not,
that's what makes it Southern.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.286
Huh?

02:33.654 --> 02:35.689
And I'd like to see a mockup
for the bouquets

02:35.789 --> 02:37.191
by the end of the day today.

02:37.291 --> 02:38.792
That is a hard
deadline, people.

02:38.892 --> 02:39.760
Better get comfortable.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.895
We could be here
for days.
What'd I miss?

02:41.995 --> 02:44.164
Oh, well, Her highness
has set a new record

02:44.265 --> 02:46.166
for opening remarks:
20 minutes.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.803
Now for new business.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.405
First up, the annual plantathon.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.507
It's time to decorate
the gazebo.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.909
So, in the interest of
speeding things along...

02:56.009 --> 02:57.311
Lemon,

02:57.411 --> 02:58.812
I didn't call on you yet.

02:58.912 --> 03:01.349
Yes, I know, but have to get
back to the Rammer Jammer.

03:01.449 --> 03:02.883
I'm prepping for a very special
show tomorrow night.

03:02.983 --> 03:04.184
Lemon booked

03:05.118 --> 03:06.186
The Head and the Heart.
Y'all should come.

03:06.287 --> 03:07.455
I didn't realize
we allowed

03:07.555 --> 03:09.457
personal solicitations
at our meetings.

03:11.325 --> 03:14.728
Well, the point is that I just
want to let everyone know

03:14.828 --> 03:16.364
what type of flowers I ordered.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.232
Three colors of roses...

03:18.332 --> 03:19.900
Oh, let me just stop you
right there.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.735
See, I am choosing
the flowers this year.

03:21.835 --> 03:24.805
Crickett, I always choose...

03:24.905 --> 03:26.340
Begonias and oleander.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.675
It'll be beautiful.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.243
Now moving on...

03:29.343 --> 03:31.245
Let it go, Lemon,
there's always next year.

03:31.345 --> 03:32.613
Crickett, you're
making a mistake.

03:33.947 --> 03:37.217
Lemon, I-I'm not sure
I heard you.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.687
Well, first of all,
begonias and oleander

03:39.787 --> 03:41.422
are an appalling combination,

03:41.522 --> 03:43.524
creatively,
aesthetically,

03:43.624 --> 03:44.625
and botanically.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.561
And second of all, oleanders
are poisonous, and I'm

03:47.661 --> 03:49.463
pretty sure that it's
in our best interest

03:49.563 --> 03:52.500
not to be killing
the good people of BlueBell.

03:55.403 --> 03:57.505
It is a good point.
(both chuckle)

04:01.642 --> 04:03.711
Well, this is
a democratic institution.

04:03.811 --> 04:05.913
Lets put it to a vote, shall we?

04:06.013 --> 04:08.916
Everyone who thinks the leader
of the Belles should choose

04:09.016 --> 04:10.318
the flowers this year,

04:10.418 --> 04:12.720
raise your hands
so I can see them.

04:12.820 --> 04:15.956
And everyone who thinks we
should trust the judgment

04:16.055 --> 04:18.526
of Lemon Breeland,
who, I remind you,

04:18.625 --> 04:21.661
recently had relations with
Meatball, raise your hands.

04:24.698 --> 04:28.569
And there you have it.
Yay, democracy!

04:33.974 --> 04:34.842
Hey, Frank.

04:34.942 --> 04:39.647
Where do I find
earplugs and antihistamines?

04:39.747 --> 04:42.015
You're gonna have to
wait for Tom to get in.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.384
I'm off duty.

04:44.352 --> 04:46.820
From 12:00 to 2:00,
I man my other business,

04:46.920 --> 04:48.822
Dixie Stop
Investigations.

04:52.560 --> 04:57.030
BlueBell's only full-service
security and investigative firm.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.866
Um...

04:58.966 --> 05:01.935
could you investigate the
mystery of where I could find

05:02.035 --> 05:03.303
earplugs
and antihistamines?

05:04.304 --> 05:04.872
Is this guy giving you
some trouble there, Frank?

05:06.139 --> 05:08.041
I was just under the impression
that I could actually buy drugs

05:08.141 --> 05:10.043
from the Dixie Stop Drugstore.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.579
Well, I could prescribe
you some ointment

05:11.679 --> 05:13.581
to get rid of that
New York attitude.

05:13.681 --> 05:16.450
(chuckles)

05:16.550 --> 05:17.585
Okay, I'm not sure

05:18.519 --> 05:19.753
what I did to offend you,
but I'm sorry.

05:20.854 --> 05:21.655
Well, maybe you should
just check with your girlfriend.

05:21.755 --> 05:24.758
You think I don't know
what she's up to?

05:24.858 --> 05:29.430
Uh, Zoe's up to nothing, except
diagnosing me and learning

05:29.530 --> 05:32.065
to juggle because you won't let
her back in her practice.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.434
"Her" practice?

05:34.468 --> 05:35.836
Her practice!
No, I didn't mean that.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.037
Oh, so that's
what she thinks?

05:37.137 --> 05:38.606
That's not what I meant.
I didn't...

05:38.706 --> 05:39.607
I spent 25 years building
this practice,

05:39.707 --> 05:41.375
and she's gonna steal it out
from under me?

05:41.475 --> 05:43.043
She's not trying
to steal it...

05:43.143 --> 05:45.379
I have seen her
schmoozing my patients.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.481
Brick, believe me, if she wanted
to steal your patients,

05:47.581 --> 05:48.716
she would have stolen them
by now.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.017
It's obvious
this town loves her.

05:50.117 --> 05:52.986
Oh, really?!

05:53.086 --> 05:54.888
Oh, so that's what
she thinks?

05:54.988 --> 05:59.026
Well, if Zoe Hart wants
to open her own practice,

05:59.126 --> 06:02.896
you tell her
to be my guest.

06:02.996 --> 06:03.997
That wasn't my point.

06:04.097 --> 06:08.068
I did not mean that.
Brick, come on!

06:08.168 --> 06:10.738
(sighs)

06:10.838 --> 06:13.674
I think he may have taken that
the wrong way.

06:15.543 --> 06:18.446
Oh, no, this can't
be happening!

06:18.546 --> 06:20.013
This is the worst news possible.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.515
What is it?

06:22.783 --> 06:24.652
Fillmore's about to get their
own minor league baseball team.

06:24.752 --> 06:27.988
Okay, so not
the wor news possible.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.122
There've been rumblings

06:30.157 --> 06:30.658
that the Daphne Mackerals
are leaving Daphne.

06:31.525 --> 06:32.426
So I called the owner,
Cameron Lynch,

06:33.360 --> 06:34.528
to pitch 'em BlueBell,
six, seven times.

06:34.628 --> 06:35.696
Lavon...
Never got a callback.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.531
Now they in negotiations
with Fillmore!

06:37.631 --> 06:38.398
Lavon!

06:39.099 --> 06:39.933
Why don't you ask Brick to help?

06:40.033 --> 06:42.503
Brick? Why?

06:42.603 --> 06:44.438
Because Brick and Cameron Lynch
are old college buddies.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.940
Which I know since,
lucky me,

06:47.040 --> 06:48.141
managing Brick's
Facebook page

06:48.241 --> 06:49.710
falls under my job description.

06:49.810 --> 06:54.081
AnnaBeth, sweetheart,
I could kiss you right now!

06:54.181 --> 06:58.051
Ooh, not a bad opening offer,
but I think you can do better.

06:58.151 --> 07:01.455
(both chuckle)

07:02.890 --> 07:05.859
It's kind of a dull pain,
you know, but sharp,

07:05.959 --> 07:07.461
if you know what I mean.

07:07.561 --> 07:09.697
It hurts when
you're slinging fish?
Yeah.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.965
It's a rotator cuff.
Get an MRI.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.100
Okay.
Okay.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.434
Thanks, Doc.
Sure.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.103
(coughing)

07:16.203 --> 07:18.572
Delma! Delma, Delma,
I do not like

07:18.672 --> 07:19.907
the sound of that cough.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.776
Maybe my biscuit went down
the wrong tube?

07:22.876 --> 07:25.513
Maybe you need to get
an X ray.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.214
Hey! There she is,

07:27.314 --> 07:30.117
the hardest-working
unemployed doctor in the South.

07:30.217 --> 07:31.819
I can't turn it off.

07:31.919 --> 07:33.086
Exactly!
Which is why

07:33.186 --> 07:35.623
I've been thinking
that you really should

07:35.723 --> 07:36.524
start your own practice.

07:36.624 --> 07:39.527
I'm sorry. Did one of us
have an aneurysm

07:39.627 --> 07:41.128
or did we not have that

07:41.228 --> 07:42.195
very conversation
this morning?

07:42.295 --> 07:44.698
No, we did, we did.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.568
So what has changed
between then and now?

07:49.236 --> 07:50.203
Joel?

07:50.303 --> 07:52.005
(laughs)

07:52.105 --> 07:53.507
Promise me that you'll see this

07:54.608 --> 07:56.009
for the funny story
that it will eventually become.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.745
Oh, no.

07:59.947 --> 08:03.150
Oh, like what you've done
with my office.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.052
Well, if it isn't
the competition.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.521
Joel has something
he wants to say.

08:07.621 --> 08:08.622
Yes, Dr. Breeland.

08:08.722 --> 08:10.223
We had a miscommunication
earlier.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.627
I in no way meant
to threaten or imply

08:13.727 --> 08:15.729
that Zoe wants
to open her own practice.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.531
That-That is the last thing
she wants to do.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.232
Very last thing. So true.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.168
Then why have I been
getting calls

08:21.268 --> 08:23.704
from old Sal Nutter asking
about an MRI

08:23.804 --> 08:26.506
and Delma Warner
requesting X rays?

08:26.607 --> 08:28.508
What do these patients have
in common?

08:28.609 --> 08:32.645
I was just making
conversation with
my friends.

08:32.746 --> 08:35.549
Or as we down here in the South,
trying to hijack my livelihood!

08:35.649 --> 08:38.619
Oh... Show him the pecan
strudel. It's amazing.

08:38.719 --> 08:39.886
Brick, I don't get it.

08:40.988 --> 08:42.522
We were doing so great
before I left for New York.

08:42.623 --> 08:43.657
We enjoyed working together!

08:44.625 --> 08:45.826
Oh, you can rewrite
history all you want.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.662
All I can say is I'm
a million times happier

08:48.762 --> 08:51.064
and this town is a trillion
times healthier since you left.

08:51.164 --> 08:51.999
Everything okay in here?

08:52.966 --> 08:53.767
Yeah. They're just in
the middle of making up.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.203
Well, don't believe me.
Ask anyone!

08:56.303 --> 08:57.805
Fine. Consider
my apology retracted.

08:57.905 --> 09:00.207
Whatever Joel said
the first time? He was right.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.242
I am gonna open my own practice!

09:02.342 --> 09:03.944
Actually, you can't.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.646
Excuse me?

09:05.746 --> 09:07.915
I was just dropping off some
files, but legally,

09:08.015 --> 09:10.150
you are not allowed
to open your own practice.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.752
Ha! That's my lawyer!

09:11.852 --> 09:14.087
Okay, we say two words to each
other in five months

09:14.187 --> 09:16.556
and this is how you want
to restart communication?

09:16.657 --> 09:19.793
Okay, look, this isn't personal,

09:19.893 --> 09:22.129
but you have a non-compete
clause in your contract, okay?

09:22.229 --> 09:24.898
If either partner leaves,
he or she is barred from opening

09:24.998 --> 09:27.567
their own practice within
20 miles of BlueBell
for at least year.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.803
He's right.
You're right.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.138
I am so happy
we're speaking again.

09:32.439 --> 09:34.708
And if you so much
as hand a sneezing
Shula Whitaker a tissue,

09:34.808 --> 09:37.210
I will sue you for
everything you're worth.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.947
Actually there's a cap
of $350,000.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.616
Oh.
Oh, well, hey,
that-that-that's better.

09:43.851 --> 09:45.653
Zoe, I'm sorry,
I had no idea.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.621
It was a beautiful
two-pronged plan, Joel.

09:47.721 --> 09:48.856
Now I got no prongs.

09:48.956 --> 09:51.692
You left me
with zero prongs!

10:08.876 --> 10:11.745
Well, you were already
gone for a while,

10:11.845 --> 10:13.280
so what's another
six months to lay low?

10:13.380 --> 10:14.748
You can do that.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.284
Do what? Not be a doctor
for that long? I'll go crazy.

10:17.384 --> 10:21.021
Just think of it
as a sabbatical.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.356
Hell, I'd love a
six-month sabbatical.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.758
Your whole life is a sabbatical.

10:24.858 --> 10:27.160
You know, there's a certain
kind of guy

10:27.260 --> 10:28.361
who might be insulted by that.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.763
Not me.
Mm.

10:29.863 --> 10:32.733
See, I am a glass half full
kind of guy.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.267
Maybe I can do that;

10:34.367 --> 10:37.404
turn off the diagnostic part
of my brain for six months.

10:37.504 --> 10:40.173
Maybe I can see Teddy Babbitz

10:40.273 --> 10:43.310
and not notice
his conjunctivitis.

10:43.410 --> 10:44.912
Or see Shula, but not see

10:45.012 --> 10:48.048
what appears to be
a pre-cancerous mole

10:48.148 --> 10:49.082
on her neck.

10:49.917 --> 10:50.751
I'm pretty sure
that's guacamole.

10:51.584 --> 10:53.754
Still, I really want
to biopsy it.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.388
Yeah, well, you're gonna
have to try harder.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.124
Looks like you got
a new best friend.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.827
Hmm?

11:00.994 --> 11:01.929
(groans)

11:02.863 --> 11:03.697
I do believe somebody
hired the nation's

11:04.564 --> 11:06.233
only pharmacist P.I.
to keep tabs on you.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.300
Ugh, Brick.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.668
This is a disaster.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.071
Six months?
I am not gonna last six days.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.073
Good luck with that.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.809
(sighs)

11:21.481 --> 11:23.683
And more pastry? Weird.

11:23.784 --> 11:26.686
Ah, this one is
a banana cream pie.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.688
All right, what
do you need?

11:28.789 --> 11:30.090
I got an opportunity
for you.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.324
Well, for us.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.160
Now, remember
how you told me how much

11:33.260 --> 11:35.228
you loved going
to baseball games as a kid?

11:35.328 --> 11:37.030
Oh...
Yeah. (chuckles)

11:37.130 --> 11:38.298
What if BlueBell had

11:38.398 --> 11:41.368
our very own minor league team?

11:41.468 --> 11:43.103
Well, that be heaven on earth.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.172
But that's a bit of a
pipe dream, isn't it?

11:45.272 --> 11:46.974
Well, actually, it turns out

11:47.074 --> 11:49.376
the Daphne Mackerals are
looking for a new town

11:49.476 --> 11:50.778
to call home.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.445
And I just learned
that their owner

11:52.545 --> 11:54.414
(groans)
is an old friend of yours.

11:54.514 --> 11:55.749
Oh, no, Cameron Lynch.

11:55.849 --> 11:56.649
You went to college with him.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.285
No, I went to
college with her.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.486
And I wouldn't call Cam Lynch

11:59.586 --> 12:00.988
a friend so much as I would

12:01.088 --> 12:02.990
the most annoying
person I ever met.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.457
Br-Brick, BlueBell needs this.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.393
You could be the savior.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.028
Just one phone call.
Get her to visit.

12:08.128 --> 12:08.996
I'll do the rest.

12:09.997 --> 12:10.864
I have been trying to
unfriend Cameron Lynch

12:11.799 --> 12:12.732
since before Facebook
was even invented.

12:13.433 --> 12:13.834
Okay, okay, okay,
look, look.

12:14.367 --> 12:15.936
Just close your eyes.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.004
Hmm?

12:17.104 --> 12:19.206
Picture this.

12:19.306 --> 12:23.076
It's opening day
for the BlueBell Mackeral,

12:23.176 --> 12:25.913
Mackeral, Mackeral,
Mackeral, Mackeral.

12:26.013 --> 12:27.014
Smell it.

12:27.114 --> 12:30.117
The-the peanuts,
the Cracker Jacks.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.451
(chuckles)

12:31.551 --> 12:34.087
The freshly cut grass.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.356
Who's that
on the pitcher's mound?

12:36.456 --> 12:38.025
It's you, Brick Breeland,

12:38.125 --> 12:39.793
throwing out
the ceremonial first pitch

12:39.893 --> 12:40.894
of the season.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.295
(crowd cheering,
bat hitting ball)

12:42.395 --> 12:43.396
All right.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.332
I'll make the call.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.936
Leave the pie.

12:51.304 --> 12:53.340
Oh.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.010
So, the test will try
to trick you into thinking

12:57.110 --> 12:59.379
that a correlation between two
things is actually a causation.

12:59.479 --> 13:00.981
And...

13:01.081 --> 13:02.816
You don't have to do that.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.384
Why can't we do this outside?

13:04.484 --> 13:05.418
It's sunny.

13:05.518 --> 13:06.786
I brought a bathing suit.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.221
Yup, after I asked you
not to.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.290
Lynly, I'm trying
to help you study here

13:10.390 --> 13:12.125
and you seem intent
on flirting.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.061
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.795
Really? You remember yesterday
when you said

13:15.896 --> 13:17.130
that you could process
information better

13:17.230 --> 13:18.065
if I held your hand?

13:19.066 --> 13:20.901
Physical contact helps a
certain kind of student.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.135
That's a fact.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.937
We're called
"tactile learners."

13:24.037 --> 13:25.839
Okay... (clears throat)

13:25.939 --> 13:28.541
Lynly, whatever it is

13:28.641 --> 13:30.410
that you think is
going to happen here

13:30.510 --> 13:32.145
is not going to happen.

13:32.245 --> 13:34.214
Okay? We are not going
to get together.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.382
And not just because

13:35.482 --> 13:37.817
Lavon would break my kneecaps.

13:37.918 --> 13:38.952
But... (chuckles)

13:39.052 --> 13:41.088
I'm not the guy for you.

13:43.891 --> 13:45.859
I'm going to wear you
down, George Tucker.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.427
And sooner or later,

13:47.527 --> 13:48.561
you will ask me out.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.230
I don't...
Can I just say

13:50.330 --> 13:52.065
one more thing?

13:53.100 --> 13:55.568
(laughs)
Is it, uh, is it LSAT related?

13:55.668 --> 13:57.437
Indirectly.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.072
I think there is
a correlation

13:59.172 --> 14:01.141
between how remarkable
your eyes are

14:01.241 --> 14:04.211
and how much I want to brush
the hair away just...

14:04.311 --> 14:04.912
Hey, guys.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.113
Uh, hey!
Sorry to interrupt.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.481
Lavon, not interrupting
at all, man.

14:08.581 --> 14:09.883
We were just studying.

14:09.983 --> 14:10.884
Lots and lots of studying.

14:10.984 --> 14:13.353
Yup, I have learned so much.

14:13.453 --> 14:14.387
Oh, good, well...

14:14.487 --> 14:15.322
you know, I hate to do this,

14:16.356 --> 14:17.891
but I-I really need George
on urgent town business.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.559
Oh, no, that's perfectly fine.
100% fine.

14:19.659 --> 14:22.129
Um, Lynly, you and I
will reschedule

14:22.229 --> 14:24.431
for sometime
in the distant future, okay?

14:24.531 --> 14:25.899
Not too distant, I hope.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.001
See you soon, George Tucker.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.306
What you need?
Step into my office.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.076
All right.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.645
Uh, now, BlueBell has
a chance to win

14:38.745 --> 14:40.981
a minor league baseball team.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.382
What? Really?
Yeah.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.017
That's-that's huge, Lavon.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.618
You know, I always thought
that I could play

14:45.718 --> 14:46.886
in the minor leagues, man.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.121
Yeah, I was a second baseman.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.656
Also was a cleanup hitter.

14:49.756 --> 14:50.490
(laughs)

14:50.590 --> 14:52.592
Do we have a name yet?
Because...

14:52.692 --> 14:54.894
the BlueBell Bombardiers

14:54.995 --> 14:56.930
suggests a really cool logo.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.265
Retro, yet intimidating.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.300
Okay, whoa, let's not get
ahead of ourselves, all right?

15:01.201 --> 15:02.569
Now, first we need options
on the-the land

15:02.669 --> 15:03.503
behind Barnard's farm.

15:03.603 --> 15:06.273
Okay.
And a cost benefit
presentation.

15:06.373 --> 15:07.941
Now, how long to put
all that together?

15:08.041 --> 15:08.976
(splutters)

15:09.076 --> 15:10.277
Three weeks if I rush it.

15:10.377 --> 15:11.344
You've got 24 hours.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.381
That's...

15:14.481 --> 15:16.049
that's not...
(laughs)

15:23.690 --> 15:25.292
Hi.

15:25.392 --> 15:26.960
Go ahead, dig in.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.595
Please, help yourselves,
so glad to see y'all.

15:28.695 --> 15:29.596
Okay.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.431
We're ready.
Okay.

15:31.531 --> 15:32.632
Okay.

15:32.732 --> 15:33.666
Ladies.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.268
Thank you for coming.

15:35.368 --> 15:36.503
I would like to tell you all
why we're here.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.239
We're not planning
a surprise party for Crickett?

15:39.339 --> 15:40.073
Oh, no.

15:40.173 --> 15:42.075
That was my cover story.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.978
Welcome to
the first meeting of...

15:45.078 --> 15:47.314
the resistance.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.350
I even got special cheese.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.951
Port Salut--

15:52.052 --> 15:53.520
eaten by the students
during the French Revolution.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.588
What exactly are we resisting?

15:55.688 --> 15:58.691
The current and very inadequate
leadership of the Belles.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.593
Crickett
and her silent partners,

16:00.693 --> 16:02.095
Elodie and Tara Jane.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.097
I thought we could all start
with our grievances.

16:04.197 --> 16:05.365
Who would like to go first?

16:06.633 --> 16:08.968
Oh, come on, Julianne.

16:09.069 --> 16:10.103
Aren't bake sales down 50%?

16:11.071 --> 16:12.539
Carol, do you think we'll
ever see the designs

16:12.639 --> 16:13.606
for the new winter scarves?

16:13.706 --> 16:15.108
Listen, I understand

16:15.208 --> 16:17.144
that you are scared
to speak out

16:17.244 --> 16:19.712
and that is how
an oppressive regime works.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.214
But this...

16:21.314 --> 16:23.250
is a safe space.
It's very safe.

16:23.350 --> 16:24.384
And I have a plan

16:24.484 --> 16:25.618
to depose Crickett.

16:25.718 --> 16:26.619
Do you now?

16:26.719 --> 16:28.021
I'd love

16:28.121 --> 16:28.921
to hear it.

16:29.022 --> 16:31.724
Oops, someone forgot
to lock the door.

16:31.824 --> 16:32.525
Oh, my God.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.661
Crickett, what a...
surprise!

16:34.761 --> 16:35.762
Ah!
We were just...

16:35.862 --> 16:37.130
Planning my party?

16:38.331 --> 16:39.466
(sniffs)

16:39.566 --> 16:41.368
Port Salut.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.236
The cheese of rebels.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.738
I presume you recognize this.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.740
I do.
Lemon Breeland,

16:47.840 --> 16:49.676
I hereby accuse you
of first-degree behavior

16:49.776 --> 16:51.744
unbecoming a Belle.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.646
Treason.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.448
(clears throat)

16:55.548 --> 16:57.016
Per bylaw six...

16:57.117 --> 16:59.018
"If you wish to remain a member,

16:59.119 --> 17:02.755
you must face
the Sanctions of ReBellement."

17:02.855 --> 17:04.391
(huffs)
That is all.

17:09.561 --> 17:11.098
Lord have mercy.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.565
(door closes)

17:19.106 --> 17:21.174
LAVON:
 Cameron, Brick, must be great

17:21.273 --> 17:22.309
to be together again.

17:23.242 --> 17:24.243
So, what's the nightlife
like around here?

17:24.344 --> 17:25.612
Oh, I'm glad you asked.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.314
Now, being a former pro athlete,

17:27.414 --> 17:28.715
I've seen your major cities.

17:28.815 --> 17:29.682
But-but the appeal here...

17:29.782 --> 17:32.352
Actually, I'd love
Brick's take on this.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.653
Brick?

17:33.753 --> 17:36.189
Oh, well, we have great
restaurants.

17:36.289 --> 17:37.557
You know, there's Fancies,

17:37.657 --> 17:39.092
and-and the Rammer Jammer!

17:39.192 --> 17:40.760
Oh, you remember
the little place

17:40.860 --> 17:42.495
we used to go to in Tuscaloosa?

17:42.595 --> 17:45.432
Remember they had those
big scorpion bowls?

17:45.532 --> 17:46.366
No, no, not really...

17:47.234 --> 17:48.668
And I did that funny
accent you loved.

17:48.768 --> 17:52.339
The rain in "Shpain"
drives me "inshane."

17:52.439 --> 17:53.540
Remember?

17:54.574 --> 17:55.074
You'd pretend to muzzle me,
and you'd be like,

17:55.942 --> 17:57.577
"No more accent.
Enough with the accent."

17:57.677 --> 17:58.478
It was hilarious.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.113
Know that I could expedite
a liquor license

18:00.747 --> 18:01.114
for any stadium we build.

18:01.614 --> 18:02.415
I'm sorry to hear

18:03.450 --> 18:04.217
about your marriage ending
a little while back.

18:04.951 --> 18:05.485
Must be tough
to meet women

18:06.052 --> 18:07.120
in such a small town.

18:08.054 --> 18:09.122
Um...
I don't see any.
Where are they?

18:09.222 --> 18:10.123
It's Frank.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.391
Uh, excuse me.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.697
She's buying a scone...

18:17.797 --> 18:18.765
No!

18:18.865 --> 18:19.832
It's a cruller.

18:20.700 --> 18:21.234
Wait, wh-what's
the difference again?

18:22.034 --> 18:22.535
BRICK:
Yeah, Frank, I don't care

18:23.069 --> 18:23.770
what Zoe is eating.

18:24.571 --> 18:26.139
Is she treating anyone
medically?

18:26.239 --> 18:28.441
Not yet, but here comes Sal.

18:28.541 --> 18:31.711
Hey, Doc, my elbow hurts
when I go like this.

18:31.811 --> 18:34.714
He's saying his elbow hurts
when he goes like that...

18:34.814 --> 18:35.815
Ow!

18:35.915 --> 18:37.284
Zoe's looking and...

18:37.384 --> 18:39.652
Sorry, Sal.
I can't help you.

18:39.752 --> 18:40.720
Damn it.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.389
So close.

18:42.489 --> 18:43.256
Hold on.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.325
There's another trout
sniffing the bait.

18:45.425 --> 18:46.859
(sneezes)
Gesundheit.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.127
I got it.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.896
Zoe gave Shula
a gesundheit.

18:49.996 --> 18:51.831
I got one gesundheit

18:51.931 --> 18:53.766
on tape--
the cat is in the box.

18:53.866 --> 18:55.568
Frank, she's allowed
a gesundheit.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.204
Just stay on her,

18:57.304 --> 18:58.638
and report back.
Ten-four.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.173
Mad Dog out.

19:02.675 --> 19:05.878
H-Hi, that was
a long phone call.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.280
(laughs)

19:07.380 --> 19:07.914
Hey!

19:08.581 --> 19:09.516
You looked
like you were

19:10.317 --> 19:10.883
getting hungry
following me around.

19:11.584 --> 19:12.785
I'm going to
the laundromat,

19:12.885 --> 19:13.786
then I'm heading home.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.722
Tell Brick I said, "What up."

19:23.696 --> 19:27.200
Listen, I just wanted to say
that I am gravely sorry

19:27.300 --> 19:28.501
for my behavior.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.304
It was an uncharacteristic
reaction to a perceived slight,

19:31.404 --> 19:33.373
and it won't happen again.

19:33.473 --> 19:36.209
Well, I'm so happy
to hear that, Lemon.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.477
Also, I was hoping
that you could lift

19:37.577 --> 19:38.878
the Sanctions
of ReBellement.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.813
Oh, no, I can't do that.

19:40.913 --> 19:43.182
Well, of course you can.

19:43.283 --> 19:44.851
As our leader, it is
both your right

19:44.951 --> 19:46.586
and your prerogative
to lift them.

19:46.686 --> 19:47.920
Then I guess what I mean is

19:48.020 --> 19:49.522
I don't want to.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.658
Crickett?

19:51.758 --> 19:53.793
What is going on with you?

19:53.893 --> 19:55.228
We have history.

19:55.328 --> 19:56.229
I was bridesmaid

19:56.329 --> 19:57.330
at your wedding.

19:58.265 --> 19:59.566
You were bridesmaid
at my near-wedding.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.902
You wrote the sweetest toast
that no one ever got to hear.

20:03.002 --> 20:05.338
Listen, you are not
the dictator type.

20:05.438 --> 20:06.973
This is all those
Baker sisters, isn't it?

20:07.073 --> 20:08.441
Elodie and Tara Jane.

20:08.541 --> 20:09.642
I don't know
what you're insinuating...

20:09.742 --> 20:10.777
Oh, come on.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.613
They are whispering in your
ear every step of the way.

20:13.713 --> 20:14.714
Using you like

20:14.814 --> 20:16.983
some puppet that kids love,

20:17.083 --> 20:18.818
but adults are very scared of.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.253
You are wrong, Lemon.

20:20.353 --> 20:21.554
You want to know the truth?

20:21.654 --> 20:24.357
Everything I learned
about leading the Belles,

20:24.457 --> 20:25.792
I learned from you.

20:27.394 --> 20:30.763
Now, if you wish
to perform the sanctions,

20:30.863 --> 20:34.567
your first act will be cleaning
the graffiti off this wall.

20:34.667 --> 20:35.902
And if not,

20:36.002 --> 20:37.770
you can leave the Belles.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.238
It's your choice.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.709
Oh, I'll perform
the sanctions.

20:42.809 --> 20:44.944
I'll perform them so well,
they'll name them after me.

20:45.044 --> 20:46.446
They'll call them the "Lemons."

20:46.546 --> 20:47.547
You hear me?

20:47.647 --> 20:49.716
The Lemons!

20:52.652 --> 20:53.953
(stomps foot)

20:54.053 --> 20:55.922
(door opens)

20:56.022 --> 20:57.990
(grunts)

20:58.090 --> 20:59.959
Holy mother of pearl!

21:00.059 --> 21:01.494
Lynly, what the hell
are you doing?!

21:01.594 --> 21:02.529
Oh, my God,
I don't know!

21:02.629 --> 21:03.596
What do you mean
you don't know?!

21:03.696 --> 21:04.631
This always seems
like a good idea

21:05.498 --> 21:06.299
when you see it in
the movies, but...

21:07.133 --> 21:07.834
What kind of movies
are you watching?

21:08.901 --> 21:09.769
I wanted to surprise you,
but I-I couldn't decide

21:10.870 --> 21:11.938
between my sexy zippered dress
or my sexy lingerie

21:12.038 --> 21:13.706
and now I know I chose wrong!

21:13.806 --> 21:15.608
Okay, no, it wasn't
just the wardrobe choice

21:15.708 --> 21:16.443
that was wrong.

21:16.543 --> 21:17.444
It was the whole thing.

21:17.544 --> 21:18.345
You need to get dressed.

21:18.445 --> 21:19.812
I'm trying.

21:19.912 --> 21:21.548
Could you turn around?

21:21.648 --> 21:23.416
Oh, now we're being modest.

21:23.516 --> 21:25.652
Yeah, sure.
But, Lynly, listen.

21:25.752 --> 21:27.554
even if I unintentionally gave
you the signals

21:27.654 --> 21:29.489
that you should come over to
my houseboat and lay down naked

21:29.589 --> 21:30.557
on my bed, which I didn't,

21:31.558 --> 21:32.425
you could not have picked
a worse day to do this

21:33.292 --> 21:33.660
because Lavon is
currently counting on me

21:34.561 --> 21:35.294
to get BlueBell...
What is taking so long?

21:35.828 --> 21:37.296
The zipper's stuck.

21:37.397 --> 21:38.498
It won't move.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.032
Could you help me, please?

21:40.132 --> 21:42.369
For the love of Pete.

21:43.603 --> 21:45.905
Okay, it's just jammed
a little bit.

21:46.005 --> 21:46.973
I just got to get
some leverage here.

21:47.073 --> 21:48.441
Be careful.
Don't rip it.

21:48.541 --> 21:49.776
All right, here we go.

21:49.876 --> 21:52.612
(grunts)
One more time, okay.

21:52.712 --> 21:53.413
(zips)
Ow!

21:54.113 --> 21:54.847
What? What happened?!
Ow!

21:54.947 --> 21:56.015
Ow, my hand is stuck!

21:56.115 --> 21:57.484
Please stop moving,
please stop moving.

21:57.584 --> 21:58.351
Oh!

21:59.051 --> 21:59.952
Oh, my God,
is that blood?

22:00.052 --> 22:01.354
(pained whimpering)

22:01.454 --> 22:02.355
That looks
like blood.

22:02.455 --> 22:03.956
You need a doctor.

22:04.056 --> 22:05.925
Yeah.
(breathing hard)

22:06.025 --> 22:06.926
We'll call Brick.

22:07.026 --> 22:07.960
No! No way!

22:08.060 --> 22:09.462
Dr. Breeland's with Lavon today.

22:09.562 --> 22:11.631
Okay, so we won't call Brick.

22:11.731 --> 22:12.865
Come on.

22:14.401 --> 22:16.636
Lynly, you need
to come...
Oh.

22:16.736 --> 22:18.671
Slowly.

22:21.107 --> 22:23.075
(birds twittering)

22:23.175 --> 22:24.811
(sighs)

22:28.848 --> 22:30.583
(door opens)

22:31.684 --> 22:33.085
How we doing?

22:33.185 --> 22:34.754
Not good, Joel.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.989
Not good at all.

22:37.089 --> 22:38.991
Would you feel
better if I told you

22:39.091 --> 22:40.627
I brought take-out
from Fancies?

22:40.727 --> 22:42.094
No, I would not.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.397
Would you feel better
if I told you

22:44.497 --> 22:46.566
I bought us airline tickets
to France?

22:46.666 --> 22:48.000
Did you?

22:48.100 --> 22:50.002
No. But I could.

22:50.102 --> 22:53.506
I feel like my brain is
on house arrest.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.775
This is why
the caged bird sings.

22:55.875 --> 22:56.743
Can I say one thing

22:57.744 --> 22:58.745
without you wanting to
throw a fork in my face?

22:58.845 --> 22:59.679
Probably not.

23:00.513 --> 23:03.516
Look, 20 miles
isn't all that far.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.117
There are other small
towns around here

23:05.217 --> 23:06.786
that need doctors...

23:06.886 --> 23:09.021
What?! No!

23:09.121 --> 23:10.857
I'm not actually
a small-town doctor.

23:10.957 --> 23:12.925
I moved back here
to be BlueBell's doctor.

23:13.025 --> 23:14.126
This town,
these patients.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.528
And now,

23:16.529 --> 23:17.597
I'm back in BlueBell,
and I can't practice.

23:17.697 --> 23:20.032
I'm like a ship without a port.

23:20.132 --> 23:21.801
A man without
a country.

23:21.901 --> 23:22.835
I was just trying to help.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.805
I know, but unless
you can find a time machine,

23:25.905 --> 23:28.675
and go back to yesterday
and not run into Brick...

23:28.775 --> 23:29.776
(phone rings)

23:29.876 --> 23:32.712
(sighs)

23:32.812 --> 23:34.514
George?

23:34.614 --> 23:36.716
You are the last person
I thought I would be calling,

23:36.816 --> 23:38.785
but I need a doctor,
and it can't be Brick.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.887
Oh, uh, yeah,
I'll be right there.

23:41.954 --> 23:43.556
I have to go.

23:43.656 --> 23:45.525
Do you want me
to come with you?

23:45.625 --> 23:47.426
Are you a trained
physician?

23:47.527 --> 23:48.828
All right.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.497
If anyone asks,

23:50.597 --> 23:51.864
you have no idea
where I am.

23:51.964 --> 23:54.166
Emotionally?
'Cause that's true.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.835
Shut up.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.470
Yeah.

24:05.912 --> 24:07.847
(clattering)

24:09.115 --> 24:11.017
Ow.

24:14.153 --> 24:16.723
(phone rings)

24:16.823 --> 24:19.592
Yo, Healer
Previously Known As Doc.

24:19.692 --> 24:20.693
Wade, I'm only calling you

24:21.594 --> 24:21.928
'cause this falls
into your skill set.

24:23.129 --> 24:23.996
I need to treat George. Can you
help get Frank off my ass?

24:24.096 --> 24:25.064
Done.

24:27.634 --> 24:29.736
(ringtone song playing)

24:31.538 --> 24:32.839
Dixie Stop Investigations.

24:32.939 --> 24:34.641
Hey, Frank. A mob
of hooligans said

24:34.741 --> 24:36.509
they were gonna
loot the Dixie Stop

24:36.609 --> 24:38.010
'cause no one's
minding the store.

24:38.110 --> 24:39.211
What? I locked up.

24:39.311 --> 24:41.113
Mm, you still keep
that spare key

24:41.213 --> 24:42.615
under the fake rock out front?

24:42.715 --> 24:44.517
You think they know?

24:44.617 --> 24:46.819
Frank, everyone knows.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.258
Zoe? Zoe?

24:52.358 --> 24:53.626
Uh, listen.

24:53.726 --> 24:55.194
Uh, I'm not following
you or anything,

24:55.294 --> 24:57.029
but could you
maybe do me a favor

24:57.129 --> 25:00.032
and-and stay put for the
next 20 minutes or so?

25:00.132 --> 25:01.500
No problem, Frank.

25:01.601 --> 25:02.869
(laughs)
Thanks.

25:14.180 --> 25:15.982
Lemon?

25:16.082 --> 25:19.051
Oh, no, Zoe Hart,
you have seen nothing here.

25:19.151 --> 25:20.152
Just move along.
Too late.

25:20.252 --> 25:21.788
Can't wipe the image
from my brain.

25:21.888 --> 25:23.656
What are you, reenacting
a scene from Annie?

25:23.756 --> 25:25.157
Oh, you'd be a better
Ms. Hannigan.
Okay.

25:25.257 --> 25:27.594
Well, I wouldn't expect you
to understand little things

25:27.694 --> 25:30.963
like history, or legacy
or tradition.

25:31.063 --> 25:33.866
Tradition? Wrong show.
That's Fiddler on the Roof.

25:33.966 --> 25:36.202
Don't you have
somewhere else to be?
Lemon, just remember.

25:36.302 --> 25:38.971
The sun will come out tomorrow.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.278
GEORGE:
How about the...?
Aah! No, no, no! Ooh! Oh!

25:46.378 --> 25:47.747
Whoa.

25:47.847 --> 25:49.215
Uh...

25:49.315 --> 25:51.250
We were studying
for the LSATs.

25:51.350 --> 25:52.619
Of course you were.
Hold on.

25:52.719 --> 25:53.820
That's exactly
what this looks like.

25:53.920 --> 25:56.122
Now, I take it
now's not a good time to talk

25:56.222 --> 25:57.089
about that whole
non-compete clause?

25:57.189 --> 25:58.925
Doesn't it preclude
this sort of thing?

25:59.025 --> 26:00.593
Okay, if you could do me
a favor and get all

26:00.693 --> 26:01.694
your wise-ass remarks
out of the way quickly,

26:01.794 --> 26:03.963
because this
really hurts.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.131
Okay.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.899
Don't worry.

26:06.999 --> 26:08.567
I've seen this
sort of thing before.

26:08.668 --> 26:10.036
(George sighs)
Usually it's not a hand,

26:10.136 --> 26:11.137
so, silver lining.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.238
(laughs)

26:12.338 --> 26:13.239
Let me...

26:13.339 --> 26:15.141
Ow! What are
you doing?

26:15.241 --> 26:16.876
Well, I have to get
the zipper teeth

26:16.976 --> 26:17.844
out of your skin.

26:17.944 --> 26:18.845
I can take you to the hospital.

26:19.646 --> 26:20.579
No! Absolutely not.
No one can know!

26:21.347 --> 26:23.082
(phone ringing)

26:24.917 --> 26:26.152
Okay, that is Lavon.

26:26.252 --> 26:27.720
I have to get that.

26:27.820 --> 26:30.156
Nobody say anything.

26:30.256 --> 26:31.691
(grunts softly)

26:31.791 --> 26:33.793
Lynly... come on.

26:35.762 --> 26:38.631
Want to know what
I did for my 50th?

26:38.731 --> 26:40.132
I got a tattoo.

26:40.232 --> 26:41.868
Want to guess what kind?

26:41.968 --> 26:44.170
Uh, uh, no, no,
I do not, actually.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.605
Do you want to guess
where I put it?

26:47.339 --> 26:49.208
Still no.

26:49.308 --> 26:50.977
You want to be
surprised. I get it.

26:51.077 --> 26:52.011
Ah.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.313
Uh, what does that mean,
you're not going to make it?

26:54.413 --> 26:55.214
You have to.

26:55.314 --> 26:57.750
I'm very sorry, Lavon,
but I have a bit

26:57.850 --> 26:59.251
of a personal emergency
right now.

26:59.351 --> 27:00.953
I am... stuck.

27:01.053 --> 27:01.921
Well, for how long?

27:02.021 --> 27:03.155
I don't know. A couple hours.

27:03.255 --> 27:05.024
I...
(quiet, high-pitched shriek)

27:05.124 --> 27:07.727
...will call you back
as soon as I possibly can.

27:07.827 --> 27:08.795
Thank you, Lavon.

27:08.895 --> 27:09.762
Bye-bye.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.163
Holy mother of mothers!

27:11.263 --> 27:12.765
What are you doing?!

27:12.865 --> 27:14.967
I am trying
to unzip you, George.

27:15.067 --> 27:15.935
Hold still.

27:16.736 --> 27:18.738
Does blood come
out of spandex?

27:21.307 --> 27:24.210
Want to know what I'm doing
for my next birthday?
(coughs)

27:24.310 --> 27:26.946
Excuse me. Now, Brick,
can I talk to you a minute?

27:27.046 --> 27:28.881
Uh, yes.

27:28.981 --> 27:31.183
I'll order your
dessert, Brick.

27:31.283 --> 27:33.352
You still
like sherbet?

27:33.452 --> 27:35.688
I have had about enough
of that wackadoo.

27:35.788 --> 27:37.223
And that is
a doctor's term.
No.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.792
You can't leave until George
gets here with the presentation.

27:39.892 --> 27:40.927
We have to stall her.

27:41.027 --> 27:42.394
Now, in case
you haven't noticed,

27:42.494 --> 27:44.130
she is into the town
of BlueBell...

27:44.230 --> 27:46.365
or at least certain individuals
that reside here.

27:46.465 --> 27:49.335
Mayor Hayes, I am
profoundly uncomfortable

27:49.435 --> 27:50.369
being used this way.

27:50.469 --> 27:52.939
I've seen you pitch.

27:53.039 --> 27:54.941
And I don't think
it's unrealistic

27:55.041 --> 27:58.310
to imagine a future
where you, Brick Breeland,

27:58.410 --> 28:03.415
take the mound as that older
relief pitcher for the BlueBell

28:03.515 --> 28:04.951
Mackeral, Mackeral,
Mackeral, Mackerals.

28:05.051 --> 28:06.385
(crowd cheering,
organ music playing)

28:06.485 --> 28:08.387
Now, y-you never
had your shot.

28:08.487 --> 28:11.924
But you'll win the big game
with your slider.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.425
(bat hits ball, crowd cheering)
Oh.

28:13.525 --> 28:16.695
Disney would make
a movie out of that.

28:16.796 --> 28:18.831
Yeah, fine,
fine, I'll...

28:18.931 --> 28:20.366
I'll stay
through dessert.

28:20.466 --> 28:23.836
Okay, good, and could you maybe
laugh at a couple of her jokes?

28:25.237 --> 28:26.839
Or not.

28:26.939 --> 28:30.076
Are you sure you know
what you're doing right now?

28:30.176 --> 28:31.043
Well, I can call Brick.

28:31.844 --> 28:32.444
I'm sure he's got
actual anesthetic.

28:32.945 --> 28:33.345
No, please don't.

28:33.679 --> 28:34.480
All right,

28:35.314 --> 28:36.983
I have removed everything
that I can.

28:37.083 --> 28:39.451
It is time to unzip
the zipper. You ready?

28:39.551 --> 28:41.320
(exhales)

28:41.420 --> 28:43.089
Yes.
Oh, God, is
it gonna hurt?

28:43.189 --> 28:44.857
Did you really just ask
that question?

28:44.957 --> 28:46.292
You think
this is gonna hurt you?

28:46.392 --> 28:47.059
You're not gonna feel a thing.

28:47.860 --> 28:48.995
I'm sorry. I was
asking about you.

28:50.096 --> 28:51.097
Well, in that case, yes!
It's going to hurt me a lot!

28:51.197 --> 28:52.131
George, knock it off.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.099
You're making her upset,

28:54.033 --> 28:55.001
which is going to make this
impossible to do

28:55.868 --> 28:56.368
without slicing off
one of your fingers.

28:57.036 --> 28:57.369
You know, there is something

28:58.070 --> 28:58.370
seriously wrong with this girl.

28:59.005 --> 28:59.738
I have told you I'm sorry

29:00.406 --> 29:01.107
I don't know how many times.

29:01.207 --> 29:02.274
I have a history

29:02.374 --> 29:04.143
of choosing terrible men, and

29:04.243 --> 29:05.978
I think when I finally
found a good one,

29:06.078 --> 29:09.148
I overcompensated
and went a little nuts.

29:09.248 --> 29:10.282
I am sorry.

29:11.483 --> 29:13.285
I don't know. Sounds like
a pretty good explanation to me.

29:13.385 --> 29:15.154
Oh!

29:15.254 --> 29:16.288
Ow!

29:16.388 --> 29:17.423
I have to go.

29:17.523 --> 29:18.958
(George groans)

29:19.058 --> 29:19.859
Oh.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.032
Oh. Ugh.

29:26.132 --> 29:27.766
(whispers):
You're welcome.

29:27.867 --> 29:29.001
You know, if, uh,

29:30.102 --> 29:31.403
our team were to settle
in BlueBell, we could eat

29:31.503 --> 29:33.505
sherbet like
this every night.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.007
Wouldn't that be nice?

29:35.107 --> 29:37.109
Uh-huh!
I hear coconut tastes

29:37.209 --> 29:40.046
especially good
off the skin.

29:40.146 --> 29:42.448
Dr. Breeland, it's an emergency.

29:42.548 --> 29:43.916
Zoe Hart's gone missing.

29:44.016 --> 29:45.784
Well, Frank, you were
supposed to follow her.

29:45.885 --> 29:46.485
Not now, Frank.

29:46.585 --> 29:47.920
She ditched me.

29:48.020 --> 29:49.355
I think maybe she's been trained

29:49.455 --> 29:51.157
in counterespionage techniques.

29:51.257 --> 29:52.358
Is there a problem?

29:52.458 --> 29:53.826
FRANK:
Last I saw,

29:53.926 --> 29:55.895
she was walking
through town square,

29:55.995 --> 29:58.931
carrying a bag that may
or may not have contained

29:59.031 --> 30:00.933
hidden doctoring equipment.

30:01.033 --> 30:02.134
Damn it.
Whoa, Brick.

30:02.234 --> 30:05.271
We are right in the middle of
entertaining our guest here.

30:05.371 --> 30:07.073
Um, you'll have to excuse me.

30:14.213 --> 30:15.047
Yeah, don't
mind me.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.548
Just a thirsty
patron here

30:16.648 --> 30:18.484
slowly dying
of dehydration.

30:18.584 --> 30:20.252
Shakespeare.

30:20.352 --> 30:21.320
What can I
get for you?

30:21.420 --> 30:22.454
Just a beer.

30:22.554 --> 30:24.857
Do you have
something imported?

30:24.957 --> 30:26.092
Whoa, imported.

30:26.192 --> 30:27.559
Well, I'd have
to check.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.195
Might have a six-pack
of something or other

30:29.295 --> 30:30.496
that Wally brought
down to Mexico,

30:30.596 --> 30:31.830
didn't drink,
and brought back.

30:31.931 --> 30:33.866
That work for you?

30:33.966 --> 30:35.334
Come on, nothing?

30:35.434 --> 30:38.437
You... all right?

30:38.537 --> 30:42.174
I'm, uh... I'm not sure.

30:42.274 --> 30:45.211
The, uh... the rules
of this place are...

30:45.311 --> 30:47.113
proving to be a little hard
to grasp.

30:47.213 --> 30:49.315
The rules of this place, or
the rules of your girlfriend?

30:49.415 --> 30:52.418
I recognize that look
you got on your face.

30:52.518 --> 30:53.986
Hell, I've worn it
myself, amigo.

30:54.086 --> 30:56.188
That is a Zoe Hart original.

30:56.288 --> 30:57.223
Tell me I'm wrong.

30:57.323 --> 30:58.991
LAVON:
Hey.

30:59.091 --> 31:00.526
Heads up. If either
of y'all know where Zoe is,

31:00.626 --> 31:02.995
you might want to tell her
that Brick's looking for her,

31:03.095 --> 31:05.064
and he's pissed.

31:05.164 --> 31:06.999
All right.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.969
Hey, Imported Beer,

31:10.069 --> 31:12.238
I know what to do. You're
coming with me. Let's go.

31:26.986 --> 31:28.988
WADE:
All right.

31:29.088 --> 31:30.556
He's going in there,
he's going to call

31:30.656 --> 31:32.091
everyone in town
till he finds her.

31:32.191 --> 31:33.525
We just need to keep him busy

31:33.625 --> 31:35.294
long enough for Zoe
to fix George.

31:35.394 --> 31:36.462
How good an actor are you?

31:36.562 --> 31:38.297
Why?

31:38.397 --> 31:39.565
Well, we need to fake
a medical emergency.

31:40.799 --> 31:43.902
So, your appendix just exploded,
you're in incredible pain. Go.

31:44.003 --> 31:45.637
Uh... uh...

31:45.737 --> 31:48.274
Oh! Oh! Oh, my...
uh, my stomach!

31:48.374 --> 31:50.909
Uh, it's like someone,
uh, took a red hot fork

31:51.010 --> 31:53.345
and just dug it into the
right side of my abdomen.

31:53.445 --> 31:55.914
Oh, God... oh, please,
God make it stop!

31:56.715 --> 31:59.551
Huh. "Please, God,
make it stop" is right.

31:59.651 --> 32:01.553
Yeah, okay, fine,
I'm a lousy actor.

32:01.653 --> 32:03.255
That's why I write.

32:03.355 --> 32:04.623
Plan B, we, uh...

32:04.723 --> 32:07.326
we try and wait him out,
hope we can get lucky.

32:07.426 --> 32:08.961
No.

32:09.061 --> 32:11.463
No, if-if this is what
it takes to save Zoe,

32:11.563 --> 32:12.965
then I'll-I'll sell it.

32:13.065 --> 32:14.066
I'll, uh...

32:14.166 --> 32:15.567
I'll-I'll go method.

32:15.667 --> 32:17.236
Here. Hit me in the gut.

32:17.336 --> 32:19.171
What?

32:19.271 --> 32:22.308
No, I'm not...
I'm not gonna punch you, fool.

32:22.408 --> 32:24.143
What, are you, uh...
what are you scared?

32:24.243 --> 32:25.944
I mean, what are you...
are you sensitive?

32:26.045 --> 32:27.113
You afraid
I'll see you...

32:28.080 --> 32:29.081
(high-pitched voice):
...hit like a girl?

32:29.181 --> 32:30.449
(laughs)

32:30.549 --> 32:31.683
(grunts)
Oh!

32:31.783 --> 32:33.252
Oh.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.621
(strains):
Yeah, that's good.

32:35.721 --> 32:38.457
Uh, Doctor?

32:38.557 --> 32:39.992
Stomach...

32:40.092 --> 32:42.028
feels like...
I swallowed a log,

32:42.128 --> 32:43.395
and someone set it on fire.

32:43.495 --> 32:45.998
You-you're not faking this
in order to distract me

32:46.098 --> 32:48.500
so I don't go looking for
your girlfriend, are you?

32:48.600 --> 32:49.668
I think I'm gonna vomit.

32:49.768 --> 32:51.237
Uh...

32:51.337 --> 32:53.339
get you in here
in the exam room.

32:53.439 --> 32:54.373
(Joel groans)

32:57.676 --> 33:00.512
Thank you.

33:02.214 --> 33:04.350
He's not coming back, is he?

33:04.450 --> 33:08.620
Brick? I'm sure he, uh, came
across a doctor emergency.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.189
You know, knowing him,

33:10.289 --> 33:12.458
he can't wait
to get right back here to you.

33:12.558 --> 33:14.293
(chuckles)
Yeah.

33:16.262 --> 33:18.464
Well, I got places I need to go.

33:18.564 --> 33:21.067
Well, would you at least like
to see the site

33:21.167 --> 33:22.568
where we'd like
to put the stadium?

33:22.668 --> 33:25.137
You know, this is just like
summer after freshman year.

33:25.237 --> 33:28.006
I thought Brick and
I were gonna drive
cross-country,

33:28.107 --> 33:29.541
but I never heard
from him.

33:29.641 --> 33:32.144
My bags were all packed.

33:32.244 --> 33:35.147
Why don't you tell
Dr. Breeland

33:35.247 --> 33:37.483
I will be unfriending him
on Facebook?

33:37.583 --> 33:40.119
Good day, Mayor.

33:50.362 --> 33:51.230
Interesting.

33:52.030 --> 33:52.664
No, I don't want
to hear it, okay?

33:53.232 --> 33:53.665
I didn't say anything.

33:54.466 --> 33:54.766
I already know
what you're gonna say.

33:55.701 --> 33:56.802
"Lemon, why are you
humiliating yourself

33:57.603 --> 33:58.237
"for such
an archaic organization?

33:59.171 --> 33:59.805
"Why do you even care
what the Belles think?

34:01.107 --> 34:02.174
Friends who treat friends
like that aren't even
friends at all."

34:03.275 --> 34:04.476
Maybe. Or maybe I was
just gonna say it's a shame

34:05.411 --> 34:07.045
I never see you sweep
the Rammer Jammer.

34:07.779 --> 34:10.181
Also, you missed a spot.

34:14.453 --> 34:15.420
(groans softly)

34:15.521 --> 34:16.722
Before I finish,

34:16.822 --> 34:20.326
let's talk about that
non-compete clause.

34:20.426 --> 34:22.094
You wrote it,

34:22.194 --> 34:23.695
so you must know
a way around it.

34:23.795 --> 34:26.063
What if I only practice
on weekends?

34:26.165 --> 34:27.533
Or get paid in euros?

34:29.034 --> 34:31.203
(chuckles)
Zoe, are you saying that you're
not gonna finish stitching me up

34:31.303 --> 34:33.505
unless I tell you how
to break the non-compete?
Hmm.

34:33.605 --> 34:37.476
You can't pull off that
kind of hardball.

34:37.576 --> 34:40.545
Stupid Hippocratic oath.

34:40.646 --> 34:42.547
(chuckles)

34:42.648 --> 34:44.116
Look, the truth is,

34:44.216 --> 34:46.518
there is no way around
the non-compete.

34:46.618 --> 34:49.355
And I don't think Brick
is 100% wrong

34:49.455 --> 34:50.621
for wanting
to enforce it.

34:51.723 --> 34:53.525
You know I'm holding a needle
above your pasty flesh.

34:53.625 --> 34:56.428
Look, you-you skipped
town for five months

34:56.527 --> 34:59.365
without giving him so much as
a word of warning, all right?

34:59.465 --> 35:01.733
When his last partner
left, it put him

35:01.833 --> 35:03.602
in a pretty
deep funk, too.

35:03.702 --> 35:05.103
His last partner?

35:05.204 --> 35:06.638
You mean Harley Wilkes,
my father?

35:06.738 --> 35:08.140
He didn't leave. He died.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.242
Exactly. And I don't
think that Brick

35:10.342 --> 35:12.110
ever really forgave
him for that.

35:24.923 --> 35:26.625
(knocking)

35:26.725 --> 35:28.160
Yeah?

35:28.794 --> 35:30.396
(clears throat)

35:30.496 --> 35:32.364
You win.

35:32.464 --> 35:35.167
You caught me.
I am guilty of

35:35.267 --> 35:38.537
practicing medicine in
BlueBell, so here you go.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.841
A check for $350,000?

35:42.941 --> 35:44.876
Yeah, you might want
to wait to cash that

35:44.976 --> 35:46.678
for about, uh, ten, 15 years,

35:46.778 --> 35:48.614
but I am done

35:48.714 --> 35:50.249
fighting with you.

35:50.349 --> 35:52.651
I'm done trying to get you
to take me back.

35:54.920 --> 35:58.324
Well, okay.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.528
Good luck to you then.

36:02.628 --> 36:04.830
Okay.

36:04.930 --> 36:07.699
(clears throat)
Before I go,

36:07.799 --> 36:09.167
you should know that

36:10.236 --> 36:11.903
when I went to New York,
I didn't realize how much

36:12.003 --> 36:14.606
I was gonna miss
being a doctor here.

36:14.706 --> 36:17.809
And that working in this office
that was my father's

36:17.909 --> 36:19.845
with a guy who became

36:19.945 --> 36:21.413
sort of a partner,

36:21.513 --> 36:25.451
sort of a mentor,
someone who was...

36:25.551 --> 36:26.818
family-adjacent.

36:26.918 --> 36:27.853
Oh, Zoe...

36:27.953 --> 36:29.187
Look, I'm just,

36:29.288 --> 36:31.223
I'm sorry, you know,

36:31.323 --> 36:33.659
for abandoning you
for my own stupid reasons.

36:33.759 --> 36:37.396
I'm sorry that you
are this perpetually
crabby jerk now.

36:37.496 --> 36:39.197
Which you kind of were
a little bit before,

36:39.298 --> 36:40.566
but only around me.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.869
So if it's my fault that you've
kind of taken that full-on now,

36:43.969 --> 36:45.604
I apologize.

36:48.006 --> 36:50.576
It is not your fault, Zoe.

36:50.676 --> 36:53.211
It's everything.

36:53.312 --> 36:55.914
I went off to marry Shelby,

36:56.014 --> 36:57.349
I came back alone.

36:57.449 --> 36:59.351
And then you weren't here.

36:59.451 --> 37:01.687
And then Magnolia, she left.

37:01.787 --> 37:06.725
My world, it's just sort of
getting smaller and smaller,

37:06.825 --> 37:08.927
and then, yeah,
I guess I did

37:09.027 --> 37:10.896
start feeling sorry for myself,

37:10.996 --> 37:13.365
and pretty soon
that's all I did.

37:13.465 --> 37:15.501
And yeah, being overworked
didn't help.

37:15.601 --> 37:17.603
That part, that was my fault.

37:17.703 --> 37:22.240
But look, I do have a plan
to turn this around, though.

37:22.341 --> 37:24.009
Uh, I am gonna hire
somebody.

37:24.109 --> 37:26.512
Not a partner,
but an associate.

37:26.612 --> 37:28.480
Somebody who is
working for me,

37:28.580 --> 37:30.882
and could maybe work
their way up.

37:30.982 --> 37:33.519
Earn their place here.

37:33.619 --> 37:34.720
You wouldn't know anybody

37:35.787 --> 37:36.655
who'd be interested
in that position, would you?

37:36.755 --> 37:39.525
(both chuckle)

37:41.527 --> 37:44.296
Wow, you even got all the gum
off the pavement.

37:44.396 --> 37:45.931
That gum's been there
for ten years.

37:46.031 --> 37:47.299
How'd you do it?

37:47.399 --> 37:48.534
Turpentine and a toothbrush.

37:48.634 --> 37:49.968
TARA JANE:
And you painted the gazebo,

37:51.236 --> 37:53.572
and pressure-washed the church
steps, and nobody helped you?

37:53.672 --> 37:54.406
That's right.

37:55.040 --> 37:55.641
And I can't wait for y'all

37:56.608 --> 37:57.843
to see how I got the graffiti
off the wall

37:57.943 --> 37:59.378
behind the Dixie Stop.

38:04.816 --> 38:06.818
I don't understand.

38:06.918 --> 38:07.953
Oh, well, which part?

38:08.053 --> 38:10.656
I made sure to use
very small words.

38:11.557 --> 38:13.659
As I was removing
my 23rd piece of gum

38:13.759 --> 38:16.562
from the sidewalk,
I realized, you know,

38:16.662 --> 38:17.763
I don't have any interest

38:17.863 --> 38:19.665
in being part of an organization
that would

38:19.765 --> 38:21.833
ask me to remove gum
from the sidewalk.

38:21.933 --> 38:24.570
Lemon, it's in the bylaws.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.905
Yeah, well, you know what you
can do with those bylaws?

38:27.005 --> 38:30.409
Or do I have to spell that out
on the wall for you, too?

38:32.844 --> 38:35.947
Crickett, Elodie,
Tara Jane,

38:36.047 --> 38:37.883
I quit, too. Hold up, Lemon.

38:39.385 --> 38:40.819
A.B., you didn't have
to do that.

38:40.919 --> 38:43.088
I know I didn't,
but I loved it.
(laughs)

38:43.188 --> 38:45.090
I was going over
the numbers in my head.

38:45.190 --> 38:47.058
We just bought ourselves
ten extra hours a week.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.060
What are we gonna do
with all that time?

38:49.160 --> 38:50.929
I say we start
by getting a drink.

38:51.029 --> 38:53.765
To the resistance!
To the resistance!

38:56.735 --> 38:58.837
(playing rock music)

38:58.937 --> 39:00.872
* I put in the pictures

39:00.972 --> 39:02.073
* You put in the time

39:02.173 --> 39:06.612
* You put all those memories
so deep inside my mind *

39:06.712 --> 39:11.717
* Now the wind, yes, the wind
keeps pushing you and me *

39:15.821 --> 39:21.960
* Time in time, I know
when it's time to leave *

39:22.060 --> 39:23.028
Yeah!

39:23.128 --> 39:27.365
* And the memories we made...

39:27.466 --> 39:32.003
Oh, hey there,
doc... umentary watcher.

39:32.103 --> 39:33.772
You can go back
to calling me Doc.

39:33.872 --> 39:35.974
Good news, Brick and I reached
an agreement.

39:36.074 --> 39:36.975
Well, congratulations.

39:37.075 --> 39:38.009
Bad news, I lost

39:38.109 --> 39:39.377
my boyfriend.

39:40.345 --> 39:40.946
I suspect he's on his way back
to New York

39:41.780 --> 39:42.414
out of fear
that I might murder him.

39:43.314 --> 39:44.049
Oh, knock it off.
You know he hasn't.

39:44.916 --> 39:45.551
Even though he'd be right
to do so.

39:46.217 --> 39:46.752
Why are you taking his side?

39:47.786 --> 39:48.754
Do you know that he picked
a fight with Brick?

39:50.021 --> 39:51.523
Yean, and you did far stupider
things when you first got here.

39:52.624 --> 39:53.625
Got George Tucker
run over, you ruined
a town parade,

39:54.392 --> 39:55.527
shorted out half
the fuses in town.

39:55.627 --> 39:56.795
And that was in
your first week.

39:58.029 --> 39:58.964
How is it that you drink so
much, yet you forget nothing?

40:00.031 --> 40:02.701
(chuckles)
Maybe just take it easy
on the guy.

40:02.801 --> 40:06.071
After all, he did take a
punch in the gut for you today.

40:06.171 --> 40:07.939
What? Who punched him?!

40:08.039 --> 40:09.941
You can ask him yourself.

40:12.210 --> 40:14.179
And he'll probably say
it was me,

40:14.279 --> 40:15.981
but just know
it's complicated.

40:18.183 --> 40:20.018
(groans)

40:20.118 --> 40:21.587
How are we feeling?

40:21.687 --> 40:23.555
Are you allowed to ask me that?

40:23.655 --> 40:25.557
Oh, I am now.
I got my job back.

40:25.657 --> 40:26.825
Oh, good, 'cause I'm gonna need
a bunch of house calls.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.494
I feel like I got run
over by a truck.

40:28.594 --> 40:29.561
Please don't tell
Wade that.

40:29.661 --> 40:30.829
It'll just go
to his head.

40:30.929 --> 40:31.830
Oh, you heard.

40:32.698 --> 40:33.699
Did you really take
a punch for me?

40:34.399 --> 40:35.601
Not just a punch. I had, like,

40:35.701 --> 40:38.036
a gallon of blood drawn,
a CT scan,

40:38.136 --> 40:39.971
endoscopy.

40:40.071 --> 40:41.139
Brick was ready

40:42.107 --> 40:43.174
to stick a tube in me
to drain an abscess

40:43.942 --> 40:44.976
before I feigned
complete recovery.

40:45.944 --> 40:48.113
I don't think I've ever felt
this way before.

40:48.213 --> 40:50.982
Uh, everything hurts.

40:51.082 --> 40:52.584
Why would you do that?

40:52.684 --> 40:55.153
Well, I guess
I figured it was the, um...

40:55.253 --> 40:56.955
Southern way.

40:57.055 --> 40:59.057
Or the BlueBell
way, or...

40:59.157 --> 41:00.458
something.

41:00.559 --> 41:01.793
Was I close?

41:01.893 --> 41:04.796
Would it hurt
if I kissed you right now?

41:04.896 --> 41:06.498
Undoubtedly,
but you should go ahead

41:06.598 --> 41:08.867
and do it--
I can take it.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.836
*

41:18.944 --> 41:22.213
* She picked me up

41:22.313 --> 41:24.783
* My friend

41:24.883 --> 41:26.518
* My friend.
