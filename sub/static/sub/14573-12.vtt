WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:04.905
(door opening)

00:20.020 --> 00:23.091
(rumbling sound)

00:25.393 --> 00:29.097
(rumbling sound continuing)

00:34.768 --> 00:36.570
(rumbling sounds stopping)

00:36.604 --> 00:38.406
(students chuckling)

00:38.439 --> 00:41.509
And so we learn
that sudden absence of sound

00:41.542 --> 00:44.178
can wake the sleeping mind
same as an alarm,

00:44.212 --> 00:46.747
out of silence.

00:46.780 --> 00:47.915
Good morning.

00:47.948 --> 00:48.949
Morning.

00:48.982 --> 00:50.050
You okay?

00:50.084 --> 00:51.419
Yeah.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.287
You want to go down and see
the nurse?

00:53.321 --> 00:55.123
I don't
need the nurse.

00:55.156 --> 00:57.225
Well, go anyway.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.259
Go on.

00:58.292 --> 01:00.261
Go ahead,
get out of here.

01:02.930 --> 01:06.033
Okay, back to neuroscience.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.436
What are dreams?

01:08.469 --> 01:09.803
Who has a thought
on dreams-- Anybody?

01:09.837 --> 01:11.805
Albert.

01:11.839 --> 01:15.443
(Albert)
If you fart in your dream,
do you fart in real life?

01:23.617 --> 01:29.257
**

01:53.147 --> 01:55.082
Who are you?

01:55.115 --> 01:56.917
Who is it?

01:56.950 --> 01:58.085
What are-- What are you?

01:58.118 --> 01:59.587
What are--

01:59.620 --> 02:01.088
Oh, the kid.
Mm-hmm.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.291
How you doing, kid--
Come on, come on in.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.029
How you doing--
What-- What was your--

02:09.062 --> 02:10.698
Lonnie--
What was your name?

02:10.731 --> 02:11.699
Louie.
Lonnie.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.167
Louie.

02:13.201 --> 02:15.102
Louie-- Come on,
what are you-- Come on...

02:15.135 --> 02:17.305
Sit down--
Have a seat.

02:17.338 --> 02:18.672
(coughing)

02:18.706 --> 02:20.274
All right,
how you doing?

02:20.308 --> 02:21.642
All right.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.277
So what
can I do you for?

02:23.311 --> 02:25.846
Wait, this is Alison, Alison,
this is, uh, Louie.

02:25.879 --> 02:28.015
Louie, Louie,
this is Alison.

02:28.048 --> 02:30.284
Hi.
Hi.

02:30.318 --> 02:32.119
You want
some product or-

02:32.152 --> 02:34.855
What do you got?

02:34.888 --> 02:38.158
I've, uh, actually
got something for you.

02:38.192 --> 02:39.860
You, what do
you got?

02:39.893 --> 02:41.495
What do you
got there-- Presents?

02:44.665 --> 02:46.967
Holy shit.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.136
Holy shit.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.538
Well, what's that about?

02:50.571 --> 02:51.872
You did this.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.674
Louie, look at this.

02:53.707 --> 02:54.842
You did this.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.510
You stole
these from school?

02:56.544 --> 02:58.178
That's badass.

02:58.212 --> 02:59.380
That is badass.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.582
Yeah, it is badass.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.150
See, look at that-- What
do you think of that, Louie?

03:03.183 --> 03:04.852
She likes badasses.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.987
Huh-- What do
you think of that?

03:07.020 --> 03:09.022
(Jeff and Alison laughing)

03:09.056 --> 03:10.591
So-so- So what'd
I say?

03:10.624 --> 03:12.893
An ounce per scale,
is that what it was?

03:12.926 --> 03:16.096
Actually,
you said two ounces.

03:16.129 --> 03:18.031
Oh, I did, did I?

03:23.271 --> 03:24.272
Now, that's fair.

03:24.305 --> 03:25.706
(laughing)

03:25.739 --> 03:27.375
All right--
Let's do some business.

03:27.408 --> 03:30.043
What do you think-- Wanna do
some business, Louie?

03:30.077 --> 03:32.446
* Louie, Louie, Louie

03:32.480 --> 03:36.183
* Louie, Louie, Louie,
Louie *

03:36.216 --> 03:38.386
Nine to five.

03:38.419 --> 03:41.689
Two-- Here we go.

03:41.722 --> 03:45.092
All right.

03:45.125 --> 03:46.560
Six ounces,
give or take.

03:46.594 --> 03:47.895
There you are.

03:47.928 --> 03:50.264
That's a good score,
kid-- Good score

03:50.298 --> 03:51.865
How'd you meet
this kid?

03:51.899 --> 03:53.066
I don't know,
I don't know him.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.134
I never heard
of him.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.569
He just
came to my door

03:55.603 --> 03:58.439
and asked for some product
the other day.

03:58.472 --> 03:59.807
Didn't you, Louie?

03:59.840 --> 04:01.409
Ask for
some product?

04:01.442 --> 04:02.810
Now he shows up with some
scientific equipment,

04:02.843 --> 04:04.612
he gets
six ounces for it.

04:04.645 --> 04:05.946
Only cash exchange between
him and I

04:05.979 --> 04:07.481
was like
a ten spot, wasn't it?

04:07.515 --> 04:08.482
(woman) Wow.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.150
Yeah, wow is right.

04:10.183 --> 04:14.054
He's got balls on both sides
of his head, look at him.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.490
What are you gonna do with
all that weed?

04:16.524 --> 04:22.162
(music playing)

04:22.195 --> 04:24.998
* Come on

04:25.032 --> 04:26.233
Mush.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.069
That is
so much weed you got.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.471
You should sell it.

04:30.504 --> 04:31.572
Make a profit.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.840
Buy some shit.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.575
Buy what shit?

04:34.608 --> 04:36.744
I'm not gonna sell it.
I'm gonna smoke it.

04:36.777 --> 04:40.514
And I'm
gonna share it.

04:40.548 --> 04:41.515
That's a waste.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.351
No, it's not,
dumbass.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.853
Gonna get laid
and make friends.

04:45.886 --> 04:48.822
Gonna be the king of this town
with a big old bag of weed.

04:48.856 --> 04:51.492
Yeah...
like a pimp.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.994
Aw, this shit,
it's so beautiful

04:54.027 --> 04:55.663
(knocking)

04:55.696 --> 04:57.164
Who's there?

04:57.197 --> 04:58.666
(man)
Keep it down, assholes.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.033
Go away.

05:00.067 --> 05:02.102
Keep it down, I gotta work
in the morning.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.671
Screw you!

05:03.704 --> 05:05.172
It's my brother.

05:05.205 --> 05:06.206
Suck my dick!

05:06.239 --> 05:07.608
Holy shit, Kenny--

05:07.641 --> 05:09.309
Kenny, get out of my room,
what are you doing?

05:09.343 --> 05:11.144
Kenny, get off me!

05:11.178 --> 05:12.646
I -- told you!

05:12.680 --> 05:15.315
Get off me, Kenny!
I told you to keep
it down!

05:15.349 --> 05:17.217
Stop--
I won't do it again!

05:17.250 --> 05:19.553
You're a loser.

05:19.587 --> 05:21.355
Look at you.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.056
You're all losers.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.057
Up here getting high?

05:24.091 --> 05:26.460
Mom is sick!

05:26.494 --> 05:28.328
What's wrong with you?

05:28.362 --> 05:30.130
What kind of way is this
to live?

05:30.163 --> 05:34.167
You aren't even in
high school and you're wasted.

05:34.201 --> 05:37.237
You're losers.

05:37.270 --> 05:39.640
You little shit.

05:39.673 --> 05:40.874
You little shit!

05:42.376 --> 05:47.080
(sobbing)

06:25.786 --> 06:27.120
What are
you looking at?

06:27.154 --> 06:28.522
You wanna look
like this?

06:28.556 --> 06:30.057
Stop looking.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.158
Douche.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.367
What's up?

06:40.400 --> 06:43.236
What's up?
What's up?

06:43.270 --> 06:46.640
Did you two just get high,
just now?

06:46.674 --> 06:51.712
(laughing)

06:51.745 --> 06:53.947
You two
are both wasted.

06:56.183 --> 07:02.756
(roaring)

07:02.790 --> 07:05.158
I'm a rabbit's
asshole!
Shut up.

07:05.192 --> 07:07.260
Please, stop.

07:07.294 --> 07:09.997
Listen, Louie, we're gonna have
this party, right?

07:10.030 --> 07:12.165
Yeah, but, where?

07:12.199 --> 07:13.166
The woods.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.267
The woods?

07:14.301 --> 07:15.636
Yeah, the woods,
all right?

07:15.669 --> 07:16.937
Nobody comes
near the school at night.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.171
All right, we get some
cute girls,

07:18.205 --> 07:19.840
we get some
cushy chicks, all right?

07:19.873 --> 07:23.176
Huh-- We get this show poppin'
what do you say?

07:23.210 --> 07:24.845
Yeah, yeah.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.179
Good idea, right?

07:26.213 --> 07:29.683
Why are we having a party
in the woods?

07:29.717 --> 07:33.687
(laughing)

07:33.721 --> 07:38.125
**

08:10.090 --> 08:13.460
Hello, Louie.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.697
Dad.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.566
What are you-
I talked
to your mother.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.801
She's fed up.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.703
She says she thinks you're
having drugs.

08:22.736 --> 08:25.973
I told her
of course you are.

08:26.006 --> 08:29.142
She doesn't know what
to do anymore.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.979
I do.

08:32.012 --> 08:36.049
From now on,
it's you and me.

08:36.083 --> 08:39.987
That's right,
no more free ride.

08:40.020 --> 08:43.490
No more vagrant,
loose behavior.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.526
No more smoking your joints,
popping your reds

08:46.560 --> 08:48.161
and your greenies,
what have you.

08:48.195 --> 08:52.065
No more disgracing your
family, no more.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.267
I'm gonna
be your policeman,

08:54.301 --> 08:56.570
because you need one.

08:56.604 --> 09:00.040
How dare you?

09:00.073 --> 09:02.910
You think you can act
like this?

09:02.943 --> 09:04.444
Not anymore.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.888
Hey.

09:14.922 --> 09:19.092
-- you.

09:19.126 --> 09:21.895
Did you hear me?

09:21.929 --> 09:28.435
I said, -- you!

09:28.468 --> 09:31.071
I mean, I haven't seen
you in, what?

09:31.104 --> 09:32.472
A month?

09:32.505 --> 09:34.742
I don't even know.

09:34.775 --> 09:37.577
I don't
have to listen to you.

09:40.781 --> 09:45.619
I mean,
who the -- are you?

09:45.653 --> 09:48.622
You want
it to be you and me?

09:48.656 --> 09:50.624
Fine.

09:50.658 --> 09:53.627
Then here's from me
to you.

09:53.661 --> 09:55.663
-- you!

09:55.696 --> 09:57.197
Get out of my room!

10:34.835 --> 10:39.606
(slow rock music playing)

10:39.639 --> 10:41.775
You know, my brother's in
a band.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.777
He always bugs me
about playing the guitar.

10:43.811 --> 10:45.879
I totally could, it's just,
you know,

10:45.913 --> 10:47.981
it's total bullshit.

10:48.015 --> 10:52.152
(laughing, chattering)

10:54.021 --> 10:55.455
Where's Brad?

10:55.488 --> 10:58.191
How am I
supposed to know?

10:58.225 --> 10:59.559
It's stupid that he's
not here.

10:59.592 --> 11:02.362
Let's go get him.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.597
Come on.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.971
Jesus Christ-- Brad lives
in a pretty big house, huh?

11:11.004 --> 11:12.706
Yeah, man.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.041
That's his
room right there.

11:14.074 --> 11:15.308
Hey, Brad!

11:15.342 --> 11:16.810
Shh, you're gonna wake
his parents.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.511
Who gives a shit?

11:18.545 --> 11:20.313
(giggling)

11:20.347 --> 11:22.582
Hey, Brad's
mother, come out!

11:22.615 --> 11:24.484
I'm waiting here!

11:24.517 --> 11:25.485
Brad!

11:25.518 --> 11:27.554
(giggling)

11:27.587 --> 11:28.688
What are you doing?

11:28.722 --> 11:31.324
You missed the party,
you asshole.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.525
Hold on.

11:32.559 --> 11:33.994
Get off the yard.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.395
I'll meet you in
the garage.

11:41.434 --> 11:42.936
(laughing)

11:42.970 --> 11:44.537
Bush--
You wear pajamas.

11:44.571 --> 11:48.241
No wonder I used to kick
your ass.

11:48.275 --> 11:49.409
Hey.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.211
What's wrong with you?

11:51.244 --> 11:53.180
I can't
see you guys anymore.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.714
What?

11:54.748 --> 11:57.684
I- My mom, she found
my pot.

11:57.717 --> 12:01.354
Taking me out of school,
sending me to Phillips Academy.

12:01.388 --> 12:05.425
I don't have the grades,
but my dad's alumni, so...

12:05.458 --> 12:07.027
And I can't
see you guys anymore.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.695
They know everything.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.430
They know what?

12:10.463 --> 12:11.865
They know what?

12:11.899 --> 12:13.566
Hey, hey.
What did you
tell, you pussy?

12:13.600 --> 12:14.734
What did you tell?

12:14.768 --> 12:18.071
I had to tell,
okay-- It was really--

12:18.105 --> 12:20.040
You could send
Louie to jail, you pussy!

12:20.073 --> 12:22.209
Stop, stop it--
Stop it.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.611
I hate you and I always
hated you.

12:24.644 --> 12:26.046
Who are you
talking to, yourself?

12:26.079 --> 12:27.247
You piece of shit!

12:32.185 --> 12:33.787
Stop it!

12:33.821 --> 12:35.288
What the hell is your
problem-- He sold you out!

12:35.322 --> 12:36.623
So?

12:36.656 --> 12:37.958
You don't
have to hit people!

12:37.991 --> 12:39.893
Why do you always have
to hit people?

12:39.927 --> 12:41.394
It's 'cause
you're a stupid moron!

12:41.428 --> 12:44.832
You're a dumbed-up stupid
idiot-- Stop it!

12:44.865 --> 12:46.133
I'm getting out
of here.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.467
You two are both
-- pussies.

12:52.806 --> 12:57.277
Theresa asks a really
fundamental question this week.

12:57.310 --> 13:01.148
What holds everything
together, right?

13:01.181 --> 13:05.252
What makes the
universe be all separate things

13:05.285 --> 13:09.289
that don't just fly apart,
away from each other?

13:09.322 --> 13:12.492
Why do atoms
bind to make water?

13:12.525 --> 13:15.495
Why does hydrogen stick
to oxygen?

13:15.528 --> 13:19.332
Why don't they
just go their separate ways?

13:19.366 --> 13:21.935
The answer is love.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.003
(students giggling)

13:23.036 --> 13:24.004
That's right.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.006
In the-
Mr. Hoffman?

13:26.039 --> 13:30.177
Yes, Doris?
Principal wants to see
Louie in his office right now.

13:30.210 --> 13:33.680
(students)
Ooh...
Okay, okay, okay.

13:33.713 --> 13:35.115
Louie,
you'd better go.

13:35.148 --> 13:38.351
Mr. Hoffman,
he wants to see you, too.

13:38.385 --> 13:40.487
Ooh!
(students giggling)

13:47.861 --> 13:51.298
What do you think this
is all about?

13:51.331 --> 13:54.401
I don't know.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.303
This is Mr. Putney
and this is Mrs. Wilson,

13:56.336 --> 13:57.537
she passed away.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.506
All right, well, you
deal with that.

13:59.539 --> 14:03.143
Hey, can I ask you
something?

14:03.176 --> 14:04.744
What?

14:04.777 --> 14:07.014
(door opening)
Come on in.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.255
Louie, take a seat.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.761
So, Doug.

14:21.794 --> 14:24.864
What can we do for you?

14:24.898 --> 14:26.433
Mr. Hoffman,
I think we have the answers

14:26.466 --> 14:28.936
to what's happened
to your scales.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.570
You are aware,
aren't you,

14:30.603 --> 14:34.374
that there are ten scales
missing from your supply closet?

14:34.407 --> 14:36.743
Yeah, I noticed we were
light on scales.

14:39.312 --> 14:42.215
Well, it has come to my
attention that the culprit

14:42.249 --> 14:45.085
is sitting here right
next to you.

14:45.118 --> 14:47.587
Louie has been
stealing scales from your room,

14:47.620 --> 14:51.558
systematically,
trading them for drugs.

14:51.591 --> 14:52.960
He's been
distributing those drugs

14:52.993 --> 14:54.061
throughout the school
and beyond

14:54.094 --> 14:56.863
at an alarming rate.

14:56.896 --> 15:00.033
Now, the scales being worth
about $300 each

15:00.067 --> 15:02.535
constitute grand theft.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.903
So...

15:06.339 --> 15:08.908
Jesus.

15:08.942 --> 15:10.877
Jesus Christ.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.745
Oh, my God.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.247
Doug.

15:14.281 --> 15:15.882
Doug!

15:15.915 --> 15:17.084
Yes?

15:17.117 --> 15:19.219
How stupid are you?

15:19.252 --> 15:20.653
Excuse me?

15:20.687 --> 15:23.890
I said, Doug, how stupid
are you?

15:23.923 --> 15:28.795
I mean, the school is
filled with worthless kids.

15:28.828 --> 15:30.430
Danny McDowell?

15:30.463 --> 15:31.831
Mike Ontario?

15:31.864 --> 15:34.501
Any of those kids from
down the lake.

15:34.534 --> 15:38.005
Look, you could pin this on any
one of them and you'd be right.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.606
But Louie?

15:39.639 --> 15:42.009
This is
a sensitive, intelligent kid.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.677
I mean, he's going through his
shit 'cause he's a teen,

15:44.711 --> 15:46.779
but this is a gentle kid.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.681
He's one
of my best students.

15:48.715 --> 15:53.120
Are you gonna sit there and tell
me that he did this by himself?

15:53.153 --> 15:56.523
This is obviously the work of
a gang of criminals.

15:56.556 --> 15:57.824
And he's
not one of them.

15:57.857 --> 15:58.925
George.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.760
And, Doug...

16:00.793 --> 16:02.695
You can't bring a -- minor

16:02.729 --> 16:04.531
into your office
and accuse them.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.299
There are laws.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.934
Do you
have proof against Louie?

16:07.967 --> 16:09.536
What's your proof?
Well, I've-

16:09.569 --> 16:12.305
We heard it was him.

16:12.339 --> 16:13.540
You heard?

16:13.573 --> 16:16.143
Yeah.

16:16.176 --> 16:17.877
You know what makes me
mad here?

16:17.910 --> 16:21.048
I have been begging you people
in this office for years

16:21.081 --> 16:23.050
to do something
about the drugs and the crime

16:23.083 --> 16:25.185
that goes on here.

16:25.218 --> 16:28.288
My own car has been
broken into three times
in this parking lot.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.822
You have done nothing.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.524
You let these kids rot

16:31.558 --> 16:33.960
and now you're gonna try to
hornswoggle this kid,

16:33.993 --> 16:36.663
never done
anything to anyone?

16:36.696 --> 16:38.765
Jesus goddamn Christ--
Come on, Louie.

16:44.371 --> 16:45.605
Shame on you.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.513
(sighing)

16:57.517 --> 16:59.119
Doris!

17:01.721 --> 17:03.323
Come here.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.325
You're such a good girl.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.026
You're such
a good girl, come here.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.361
Okay, you ready?

17:08.395 --> 17:10.263
Come on,
I need you to-

17:10.297 --> 17:11.831
I need you to cooperate
with me here.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.366
Come on.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.602
Got it--
Come on, come on--

17:15.635 --> 17:17.370
Come on, damn it.

17:17.404 --> 17:20.840
Pepper, come on, look, hey,
you gotta have your drops.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.842
You understand me?

17:22.875 --> 17:24.544
You wanna go blind?

17:24.577 --> 17:25.712
Huh?

17:25.745 --> 17:26.746
No?

17:26.779 --> 17:28.415
You wanna go blind?

17:28.448 --> 17:30.049
No, you don't wanna
go blind.
(knocking)

17:30.083 --> 17:32.719
Ah, sh--
Okay, we'll do this later.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.454
I love you.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.389
A reprieve
from the governor.
(spitting out fur)

17:36.423 --> 17:38.891
Filthy animal.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.264
Oh, hey, Louie,
come on in.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.236
Don't touch the cat,
he's got a...

17:49.269 --> 17:50.603
a yeast
infection in his eye.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.139
I don't know,
don't ask me.

17:54.341 --> 17:56.576
Disgusting.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.044
What do you got?

17:58.077 --> 18:01.047
What can
I do you for?

18:01.080 --> 18:05.385
I need to get
the scales back.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.953
What?

18:10.757 --> 18:12.825
Can I get them back?

18:12.859 --> 18:14.994
You want-
(laughing)

18:15.027 --> 18:17.597
You want me
to get the ten scales

18:17.630 --> 18:19.966
from the drug dealers
I sold them to?

18:19.999 --> 18:21.168
I'll find
a way to pay you back.

18:21.201 --> 18:24.904
I just-- I just need
to return them.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.839
How are you
gonna pay me back?

18:26.873 --> 18:30.143
You still got that weed
I gave you?

18:30.177 --> 18:33.413
I smoked it.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.081
You smoked it?

18:35.114 --> 18:36.849
All of it?

18:36.883 --> 18:39.018
Well, I shared it,
but I--

18:39.051 --> 18:40.320
You shared it?

18:40.353 --> 18:43.990
Well, that's
nice of you.

18:44.023 --> 18:46.659
(chuckling)
But...

18:46.693 --> 18:48.528
now you got nothing.

18:51.631 --> 18:55.435
Mmm-- Not so
smart after all, are you?

18:55.468 --> 18:57.003
Louie, Louie.

18:57.036 --> 18:59.606
Louie, Louie.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.308
I gotta
help you, now, right?

19:01.341 --> 19:02.475
I'll help you out--
I gotta help you out

19:02.509 --> 19:03.610
Come here.

19:03.643 --> 19:07.113
Come here.
(gasping for breath)

19:07.146 --> 19:09.616
Just breathe, you okay--
You're all right.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.951
You're all right,
aren't you-- You're all right.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.286
You listening to me?

19:13.320 --> 19:15.322
You listening?

19:15.355 --> 19:17.290
You scared?

19:17.324 --> 19:19.792
Okay, 'cause a second ago,
you weren't scared.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.794
You're scared now.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.630
Yeah.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.632
What do you think?

19:25.665 --> 19:27.500
Huh?

19:27.534 --> 19:30.670
'Cause you're a kid,
I ain't gonna hurt you?

19:30.703 --> 19:32.138
You think this is
games-- No, no.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.541
This is man
shit right here.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.175
You understand that?

19:36.209 --> 19:38.678
You're not a kid,
you're a man now.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.313
You stole
property, Louie.

19:40.347 --> 19:41.881
A lot of property.

19:41.914 --> 19:44.717
What is that, ten scales--
That's like...

19:44.751 --> 19:46.819
Two grand, isn't it?

19:46.853 --> 19:48.888
That's larceny.

19:48.921 --> 19:51.558
That is
some sick shit.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.326
I never did nothing like
that, nothing like that.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.027
From your own school--
That's some sick shit.

19:55.061 --> 20:00.500
That's some real
man shit right there.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.034
Jesus, sit down,
sit down.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.072
(coughing)

20:07.874 --> 20:10.076
You're a criminal now.

20:10.109 --> 20:12.512
You understand that,
right?

20:12.545 --> 20:15.548
You think you're innocent
'cause you're a kid, right?

20:15.582 --> 20:17.384
No.
No.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.386
You're not.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.354
You did this, Louie,
you did this.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.356
Right?
I did it.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.692
What'd you do?

20:25.725 --> 20:26.859
You got stupid,
didn't you?

20:26.893 --> 20:27.860
You got greedy.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.028
You got caught.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.897
Dumb, dumb dummy.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.732
This is yours--
You did it.

20:32.765 --> 20:37.203
Now it's consequences.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.771
You came
to me, remember?

20:38.805 --> 20:40.973
I don't sell to kids, never,
not ever.

20:41.007 --> 20:42.375
You came to me, you brought
these scales to me,

20:42.409 --> 20:43.710
now you
want 'em back?

20:43.743 --> 20:45.044
Well, there is no back,
you understand that?

20:45.077 --> 20:47.947
Not for you, not ever.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.982
I don't know
what to do.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.955
Ahh.

20:55.988 --> 20:59.492
Well, you gotta
figure that out, don't you?

20:59.526 --> 21:02.962
You know,
more importantly.

21:02.995 --> 21:05.332
I need you
to convince me...

21:05.365 --> 21:07.166
that your shitty shit
man shit

21:07.199 --> 21:09.402
is not
gonna get all over me

21:09.436 --> 21:13.740
and I'm not gonna get a knock
on my door I don't want.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.408
You understand?

21:15.442 --> 21:16.843
'Cause I
don't like surprises.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.177
I don't like surprises.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.046
You remember I told
you that.

21:25.217 --> 21:27.153
Louie, what--

21:27.186 --> 21:29.322
What do I gotta do--
What do I gotta do now?

21:29.356 --> 21:30.523
Huh?

21:30.557 --> 21:32.425
Do I gotta hurt you?
No.

21:32.459 --> 21:35.362
Huh-- Huh--

21:35.395 --> 21:36.963
Do I gotta cut
off your goddamn finger,

21:36.996 --> 21:39.065
shove it up your ass,
is that where we are?
No.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.702
Look, I gotta--
I got things I gotta do.

21:42.735 --> 21:46.773
Now I gotta do this
now-- Huh?

21:46.806 --> 21:48.975
This is your mess.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.510
This is your man
shit mess-- You clean it up.

21:50.543 --> 21:52.144
Get the out of here.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.456
Come here, Pepper.

22:03.490 --> 22:09.429
**

22:58.277 --> 23:00.813
Get on the radio, call Mackie,
tell him ten minutes.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.699
Louie.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.468
In here now.

23:32.479 --> 23:33.646
(Faria)
Ha, ha, loser.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.347
That's enough,
Mr. Faria.

23:42.689 --> 23:44.591
Go on in,
get your druthers.

23:54.467 --> 23:56.636
What happened
to Danny?

23:56.669 --> 23:59.305
He was arrested
for beating up Brad Diver.

23:59.338 --> 24:00.740
Vandalism.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.108
A whole
bunch of other stuff.

24:08.047 --> 24:10.449
You know, you guys are
like the worst class

24:10.483 --> 24:13.285
we ever had in
this school.

24:13.319 --> 24:15.822
So, good riddance.

24:15.855 --> 24:17.557
I'm done with you.

24:22.995 --> 24:24.864
Listen.

24:24.897 --> 24:27.500
I know you
took the scales.

24:27.534 --> 24:30.670
We both know
you're guilty.

24:30.703 --> 24:32.772
But here's the thing.

24:32.805 --> 24:36.275
There's nothing
I gotta do about it.

24:36.308 --> 24:39.812
I gotta drop it...
I gotta let it go.

24:39.846 --> 24:42.481
I mean,
I'm not a policeman,

24:42.515 --> 24:44.551
I'm not equipped to handle
a crime like this,

24:44.584 --> 24:46.786
I'm an educator.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.220
And I think you got yourself
into something

24:48.254 --> 24:53.726
you can't handle
the repercussions.

24:53.760 --> 24:57.997
It's not easy for a kid like
you to take on what you did,

24:58.030 --> 25:00.499
so I'm gonna
take it on for you.

25:00.533 --> 25:02.735
Yeah, it's gonna hurt
my budget,

25:02.769 --> 25:05.404
it'll impact
my record, but I'm a man.

25:05.437 --> 25:07.039
I can take it.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.579
But you know what?

25:12.612 --> 25:15.014
I feel sorry
for you.

25:15.047 --> 25:16.415
'Cause when this comes
back to visit

25:16.448 --> 25:19.285
and you someday have
to face what you did here?

25:21.520 --> 25:23.255
Go on.

25:23.289 --> 25:25.424
Go finish out your year.

25:25.457 --> 25:28.527
You don't
have much longer anyway.

25:28.561 --> 25:30.062
Go.

25:43.475 --> 25:44.977
Hi.

25:46.913 --> 25:49.348
Do you have something
to tell me?

25:49.381 --> 25:54.854
No-- Why?
Do you have something
to say to me?

25:54.887 --> 25:56.188
I am your mother.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.324
Do you have anything
to say to your mother?

26:01.393 --> 26:05.364
You haven't said
a word to me in months.

26:05.397 --> 26:06.966
You're not even here.

26:06.999 --> 26:08.868
I mean,
who are you?

26:08.901 --> 26:11.370
We used to be friends,
do you remember that?

26:11.403 --> 26:13.539
Back when
you were a person?

26:13.572 --> 26:15.441
'Cause you're not now.

26:15.474 --> 26:17.043
You know what you are?

26:17.076 --> 26:19.545
And I don't care if it's
the drugs or what,

26:19.578 --> 26:21.648
but do you want to
know what you are to me,

26:21.681 --> 26:23.983
in this house?

26:24.016 --> 26:26.118
You're boring.

26:26.152 --> 26:28.955
You're sullen,
you're vacant.

26:28.988 --> 26:31.824
You show me no love.

26:31.858 --> 26:34.460
What are you?

26:34.493 --> 26:35.895
I mean, who cares?

26:35.928 --> 26:38.497
Do you care-- I don't--
I do not care.

26:38.530 --> 26:40.432
I don't care anymore, okay?

26:40.466 --> 26:41.768
I can't.

26:41.801 --> 26:44.170
I can't do this.

26:44.203 --> 26:47.439
I am sorry that I have
to work all day

26:47.473 --> 26:49.075
and that
I am not here, okay?

26:49.108 --> 26:51.077
But I don't know
what to do.

26:51.110 --> 26:54.080
I'm sorry,
but it's just me here.

26:54.113 --> 26:58.317
And I thought
that we had a deal.

26:58.350 --> 27:00.586
Where are you?

27:00.619 --> 27:03.589
This is not fair.

27:03.622 --> 27:07.827
You know what, Louie--
I don't like you.

27:07.860 --> 27:09.461
I don't.

27:09.495 --> 27:12.031
And if this
shit doesn't change,

27:12.064 --> 27:14.867
I mean, you're gonna be
in high school in the fall,

27:14.901 --> 27:18.805
and if this stays like this,
you're not staying here.

27:18.838 --> 27:21.540
And I don't care where
you're going, okay?

27:21.573 --> 27:23.209
I don't care!

27:26.012 --> 27:27.346
Go!

27:47.066 --> 27:49.035
(sobbing)

28:16.062 --> 28:17.864
What time is it?

28:17.897 --> 28:20.566
It's 6:00--
You took a long nap.

28:20.599 --> 28:21.901
Have a seat there.

28:30.877 --> 28:32.344
Your sister gets home
from her playdate

28:32.378 --> 28:33.512
in about an hour.

28:33.545 --> 28:35.414
Here you go.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.521
(man)
President Ronald Reagan
held his first

28:42.554 --> 28:44.623
press conference today
since the attempt on his life

28:44.656 --> 28:46.192
in March of this year.

28:46.225 --> 28:47.927
The president said that his
health is good

28:47.960 --> 28:51.363
and he is performing
his job at his normal pace.

28:51.397 --> 28:54.233
James Earl Ray, convicted
assassin of Martin Luther King

28:54.266 --> 28:56.068
was stabbed 22-and-a-half
times

28:56.102 --> 28:58.037
by four
of his fellow inmates...
Jesus.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.571
...at the Brushy Mountain
State Penitentiary

28:59.605 --> 29:01.540
near Petros, Tennessee.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.042
Ray is
in critical condition

29:03.075 --> 29:04.944
but expected to survive
the attack.

29:04.977 --> 29:07.579
US Secretary of State
Alexander Haig today announced

29:07.613 --> 29:10.416
that the United States
will for the first time
sell weapons

29:10.449 --> 29:12.184
to the
People's Republic of China.

29:15.021 --> 29:17.423
Hi.

29:23.195 --> 29:25.564
Hi, I have
an appointment.

29:25.597 --> 29:29.001
Louie.

29:29.035 --> 29:30.803
Thanks.

29:56.628 --> 29:57.930
Hey.

29:57.964 --> 30:00.099
What are you-
Is your dad here?

30:00.132 --> 30:02.368
Uh, yeah, come in.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.873
We're going to Martha's
Vineyard for the summer.

30:06.906 --> 30:10.009
He's doing one last
big dinner.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.180
Dad.

30:14.213 --> 30:16.148
Hey.

30:16.182 --> 30:17.783
What are
you doing here?

30:17.816 --> 30:19.385
Do you want to stay for dinner--
We got plenty of food.

30:19.418 --> 30:23.289
I stole the scales.

30:23.322 --> 30:26.325
I stole all ten
of them.

30:26.358 --> 30:29.195
I sold
them to a dealer, I--

30:29.228 --> 30:32.664
He gave me pot,
and I smoked it.

30:32.698 --> 30:34.000
I got a bunch of
kids high

30:34.033 --> 30:37.403
and I tried to
get them back, I did,

30:37.436 --> 30:42.741
but I can't.

30:42.774 --> 30:44.643
But...

30:44.676 --> 30:51.918
I stole them
and I'm sorry.

30:51.951 --> 30:53.752
I'm sorry.

31:28.087 --> 31:30.356
Wow.

31:30.389 --> 31:34.526
Sounds like you
had a pretty dramatic year.

31:34.560 --> 31:38.364
But the truth is...

31:38.397 --> 31:40.366
I mean, look,
you're a teenager.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.701
You did a bunch of drugs.

31:42.734 --> 31:46.038
You were medicating.

31:46.072 --> 31:48.107
Your parents got divorced
a couple of years ago.

31:48.140 --> 31:53.112
I think-- I think that was
just too hard for you.

31:53.145 --> 31:55.047
It was just too much.

31:55.081 --> 32:01.153
So you turned
to drugs to cope.

32:01.187 --> 32:03.389
I don't think so.

32:03.422 --> 32:04.590
No?

32:04.623 --> 32:06.792
Why?

32:06.825 --> 32:12.064
Well, I don't really care
about my parents divorcing.

32:12.098 --> 32:14.600
It's no big deal.

32:14.633 --> 32:18.104
I don't have any
feelings about it, really.

32:18.137 --> 32:21.007
Yeah, so the drugs
are working.

32:21.040 --> 32:23.509
Look, you gotta
give yourself a break, man.

32:23.542 --> 32:27.980
You're not a bad guy.

32:28.014 --> 32:29.815
I suggest you try
to stop the drugs

32:29.848 --> 32:33.352
and make better choices,
from here on out.

32:33.385 --> 32:35.921
That's all you
can do.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.156
Your parents
can't help you.

32:37.189 --> 32:38.324
They don't know what
to do because

32:38.357 --> 32:40.826
they're part
of your problem

32:40.859 --> 32:44.096
and they're not
perfect.

32:44.130 --> 32:47.933
So it's up to you.

32:47.966 --> 32:51.370
If you need help, I'm here.

32:51.403 --> 32:53.005
And so is your mom.

32:57.676 --> 32:59.845
Are you gonna say a big
thing now.

32:59.878 --> 33:03.682
About the pot
and everything?

33:05.817 --> 33:08.620
No.

33:08.654 --> 33:12.391
Just...

33:12.424 --> 33:15.861
Goodbye to your childhood,
I guess.

33:15.894 --> 33:17.563
Maybe.

33:17.596 --> 33:20.799
No.

33:20.832 --> 33:23.402
Just, I love you.

33:23.435 --> 33:26.405
And I'm here.

33:26.438 --> 33:30.376
That's all I got.

33:30.409 --> 33:32.844
Well, do you wanna...
