00:06.500 --> 00:08.133
**

00:08.133 --> 00:09.867
(George sighs)

00:09.867 --> 00:11.200
Good morning, George.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.033
Good morning?
Tt's not a good morning.

00:13.033 --> 00:14.867
It's a great morning.

00:14.867 --> 00:17.400
Last night, Lori and I--
Look it...

00:17.400 --> 00:19.867
I don't even chew gum,
that's hers.

00:19.867 --> 00:22.667
And sexually,
I almost went twice.

00:22.667 --> 00:23.967
I tried to go.

00:23.967 --> 00:25.400
Airplane looked like
it was gonna get up.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.067
And then she wanted
to go brush her teeth

00:27.067 --> 00:29.133
and it went-- shhk!
Let's just say the airplane

00:29.133 --> 00:31.333
had a little
mechanical difficulties.

00:31.333 --> 00:33.867
But listen, Lori
and I are back...

00:33.867 --> 00:35.833
(muffled whistle)
On track.

00:35.833 --> 00:37.800
Look how in love he is.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.133
Yes, and in
the same clothes

00:39.133 --> 00:40.667
he wore last night
when he left.

00:40.667 --> 00:42.367
George, it's
the walk of shame.

00:42.367 --> 00:44.133
You're a whore.
That's right,
I am a whore.

00:44.133 --> 00:46.033
(sniffs)
And you know what?
I smell like one too.

00:46.033 --> 00:48.000
Phew, man, let me
tell you something.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.400
We went to dinner,
and then she

00:49.400 --> 00:50.500
took me shopping
on Rodeo Drive.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.033
I didn't have
to pay for nothing.

00:52.033 --> 00:53.800
So you-- you got yourself
a little sugar mama, huh?

00:53.800 --> 00:55.033
I hope so.

00:55.033 --> 00:56.167
(Hector)
Baby, I'll see what I can do.

00:56.167 --> 00:58.200
Your Uber's out front.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.833
Hector had a little
play date, huh?

01:00.833 --> 01:02.200
No breakfast?

01:02.200 --> 01:03.900
No "I'll call you
tomorrow", nothing.

01:03.900 --> 01:05.633
You just got it all
figured out, don't you?

01:05.633 --> 01:07.767
Gotta take control
with your ladies, right?

01:07.767 --> 01:09.167
Can't be a cuck.

01:09.167 --> 01:12.167
Yeah, that's a good attitude
for summer of 1951.

01:12.167 --> 01:14.233
Look, what goes
around comes around.

01:14.233 --> 01:15.900
Men are back
to being men.

01:15.900 --> 01:17.433
They are, really?
Since when?

01:17.433 --> 01:19.300
I don't know
what that means.

01:19.300 --> 01:21.367
Oh, jefe, Wendy asked me
to give you this.

01:21.367 --> 01:24.767
I was hoping it was
a love note.

01:24.767 --> 01:27.067
This a note for
a parent-teacher
conference.

01:27.067 --> 01:28.233
I'm not doing
very well in school.

01:28.233 --> 01:29.500
Yeah, but why would I go?

01:29.500 --> 01:31.067
Why wouldn't you give
this to your mom?

01:31.067 --> 01:32.400
I didn't wanna
get in trouble,

01:32.400 --> 01:33.733
so I put you down as
my responsible adult.

01:33.733 --> 01:35.200
Right above
my parole officer.

01:35.200 --> 01:36.867
All right, I'll tell
you what, I'm a do it.

01:36.867 --> 01:38.667
Like I don't have
enough things to do
with your mom suing me

01:38.667 --> 01:41.233
over that stupid ass grill
with her Latino lawyer.

01:41.233 --> 01:42.867
I'll handle this.

01:42.867 --> 01:44.067
Don't worry, Manolo,
I got it.

01:44.067 --> 01:45.433
Thanks, jefe.

01:45.433 --> 01:48.600
And tell her I might
be late for dinner.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.533
**

01:53.600 --> 01:55.233
So, new?

01:55.233 --> 01:57.467
Well, my magency's
really picking up.

01:57.467 --> 01:59.633
And the network's about to
greenlight my show "Valleys."

01:59.633 --> 02:00.733
So, fingers crossed.

02:00.733 --> 02:01.967
We're smoking it.

02:01.967 --> 02:04.333
Oh, and I'm seeing Jason.
And Rachel.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.467
Having much fun.

02:05.467 --> 02:06.967
Still so popular.

02:06.967 --> 02:08.200
Mom, Jason and Rachel

02:08.200 --> 02:10.300
are the execs
on my show "Valleys."

02:10.300 --> 02:12.333
And Jason's married.
So?

02:12.333 --> 02:14.967
So... I don't want your "love
life" to screw up my show.

02:14.967 --> 02:16.567
Negative much?

02:16.567 --> 02:18.867
I'm very proud of you for
getting your life together.

02:18.867 --> 02:20.067
I got her life together.

02:20.067 --> 02:21.700
Be happy for your sister.

02:21.700 --> 02:25.067
She's dating many people
and you're not dating anyone.

02:25.067 --> 02:27.933
(withering chuckle)

02:27.933 --> 02:30.933
So, you don't deny
that you saw my client

02:30.933 --> 02:34.400
wheel her sausages grill
inside the comedy club?

02:34.400 --> 02:36.133
Yes-- I mean, no.

02:36.133 --> 02:38.500
I was already working
on, uh, projects

02:38.500 --> 02:40.200
because I had a meeting
with my friend, Jake.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.667
Mm-hmm.

02:41.667 --> 02:43.100
And he had asked me to,
you know,

02:43.100 --> 02:46.800
prepare some things
for GVN, uh, and...

02:46.800 --> 02:49.100
You know, like,
what George Foreman did

02:49.100 --> 02:50.900
with the George
Foreman Grill.

02:50.900 --> 02:52.433
Uh-huh.

02:52.433 --> 02:54.300
Your friend told you to,
to come up with something

02:54.300 --> 02:55.700
like the George
Foreman Grill.

02:55.700 --> 02:57.700
So, you rack
your brain for days,

02:57.700 --> 03:00.067
then came up with
the George Lopez Grill?

03:00.067 --> 03:02.067
Wait, um...
Wait a minute, my--

03:02.067 --> 03:05.067
My, mine's different,
you know, it's Mexican style.

03:05.067 --> 03:06.633
And you can grill indoors.

03:06.633 --> 03:09.500
Indoors, where my client was
trying to move her grill.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.467
(clears throat)
It's hot in here.

03:16.133 --> 03:18.267
Okay, I'd like to have that
stricken from the record.

03:18.267 --> 03:20.300
What do we gotta pay to
make this thing go away?

03:20.300 --> 03:22.100
Why don't we all relax,

03:22.100 --> 03:24.267
and perhaps the counselor and
I could go and discuss this.

03:24.267 --> 03:26.233
Vamos, seÃ±orita.

03:29.333 --> 03:31.467
(speaking Spanish)

03:36.567 --> 03:38.733
I'm concerned for Manolo.

03:38.733 --> 03:41.567
His grades have been taking
a real nosedive lately.

03:41.567 --> 03:44.200
Has anything changed at home
that I should know about?

03:44.200 --> 03:47.133
Uh, let me think, well...

03:47.133 --> 03:51.400
His girlfriend
dumped him, you.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.333
The main reason
I called this meeting

03:53.333 --> 03:55.700
is that Manolo has stopped
wearing his glasses!

03:55.700 --> 03:57.400
I know, I think
that's great, don't you?

03:57.400 --> 03:58.767
He looks pompous
in those things.

03:58.767 --> 04:00.400
Like, you just wanna
punch him in the face.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.367
No, I think
he looks handsome.

04:02.367 --> 04:03.933
Very distinguished.

04:03.933 --> 04:05.867
You don't see him like I do
rubbing his chin all day

04:05.867 --> 04:07.633
like he's deep in thought,
like he's gonna become

04:07.633 --> 04:09.300
some professor
of Chicano studies.

04:09.300 --> 04:11.067
Well, you know, he is
one of my best students.

04:11.067 --> 04:15.367
And he works really hard.
And he will move on.

04:15.367 --> 04:17.933
Probably leave me one day
for an exciting career

04:17.933 --> 04:21.400
in data entry
or refrigerator repair
or something like that.

04:21.400 --> 04:24.067
No, come on,
he's crazy about you,
head over heels.

04:24.067 --> 04:25.767
Matter of fact,
I'm a little concerned

04:25.767 --> 04:27.233
that he might hurt
himself, actually

04:27.233 --> 04:29.400
Really?
Mm-hmm.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.633
(chuckling)

04:30.633 --> 04:33.500
Well, as nice
as that is to hear,

04:33.500 --> 04:35.967
the point is...
he can't see.

04:35.967 --> 04:37.600
And if he can't see,

04:37.600 --> 04:40.067
he won't pass his final
exam and graduate.

04:40.067 --> 04:41.467
He must wear his glasses.

04:41.467 --> 04:42.800
How about this?

04:42.800 --> 04:44.367
How about laser
surgery on his eyes?

04:44.367 --> 04:45.500
That's a remedy
right there.

04:45.500 --> 04:46.600
He won't even
need glasses.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.067
Oh, yeah, I mentioned
that to him,

04:48.067 --> 04:49.300
and he just
burst out crying.

04:49.300 --> 04:50.867
He is petrified
of that procedure.

04:50.867 --> 04:52.800
Laser surgery.
Your know what I'll do?

04:52.800 --> 04:54.367
I'll make
an appointment for him.

04:54.367 --> 04:55.867
I'll go with him,
hold his hand through

04:55.867 --> 04:57.200
the whole procedure,
make sure he's all right.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.900
Well, if you go
with him...

04:59.900 --> 05:01.067
Yes.

05:01.067 --> 05:02.200
Gonna hold his hand?

05:02.200 --> 05:03.933
Yeah, I'll do--
Mm-hmm.

05:03.933 --> 05:07.067
Yeah, be very gentle
with him 'cause...

05:07.067 --> 05:08.100
Mm-hmm.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.733
(whispers)
He likes that.

05:10.733 --> 05:13.067
Is this still
a parent-teacher
conference?

05:13.067 --> 05:14.700
To frivolous lawsuits.

05:14.700 --> 05:18.533
May they all be disposed
of for five grand.

05:18.533 --> 05:20.633
Wait a minute, I gotta
pay Manolo's mom $5,000?

05:20.633 --> 05:23.433
Apparently, she wants
a taco truck, so, yes.

05:23.433 --> 05:24.667
Oh, and an apology.

05:24.667 --> 05:26.800
But it's not
exactly an apology.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.967
More like
an endorsement
for her truck.

05:28.967 --> 05:30.367
And then
everything goes away.

05:30.367 --> 05:32.233
All right.
Mm-hmm.

05:32.233 --> 05:34.833
Mmm, oh, I got
you something.

05:34.833 --> 05:36.333
You did?
Yup.

05:36.333 --> 05:38.333
Hm, what's this?

05:38.333 --> 05:40.200
Some new chic,
casual clothes

05:40.200 --> 05:43.633
for our trip
to Costa Rica.

05:43.633 --> 05:46.500
I didn't know we were
going to Costa Rica?

05:46.500 --> 05:49.167
Yup, this weekend.
We're taking my plane.

05:49.167 --> 05:51.500
Oh, well,
I didn't know, I...

05:51.500 --> 05:53.500
Well, now you do know.

05:53.500 --> 05:55.800
Oh, Costa Rica.
Hmm.

05:55.800 --> 05:58.367
All right, yeah,
sure, why not?
Great.

05:58.367 --> 06:00.600
Why not?
(chuckling)

06:00.600 --> 06:01.967
Well, aren't you
gonna try them on?

06:01.967 --> 06:03.733
Unh-unh, I'll
try 'em on later.

06:03.733 --> 06:05.467
Why don't you help me
get out of these clothes?

06:05.467 --> 06:08.433
Oh, okay, you can
try them on later.

06:08.433 --> 06:11.567
**

06:16.233 --> 06:17.867
How'd it go with Wendy?
Great.

06:17.867 --> 06:19.567
You know, I think she's
still sweet on you.

06:19.567 --> 06:21.533
The thing is, she's
worried about her job,

06:21.533 --> 06:22.967
you know, being
a professional and stuff.

06:22.967 --> 06:24.533
So, if I could give
you some advice.

06:24.533 --> 06:26.333
I would say wait till
you pass the test,

06:26.333 --> 06:27.667
and then go for it.

06:27.667 --> 06:29.667
Oh, and she wants you
to have laser eye surgery.

06:29.667 --> 06:31.300
Well, wait, I'm scared
of that shit.

06:31.300 --> 06:33.233
I'd rather to go back
to wearing my glasses.

06:33.233 --> 06:34.667
Well, you can't.

06:34.667 --> 06:35.933
Okay, I probably
shouldn't tell you this

06:35.933 --> 06:37.600
but Wendy hates
you in glasses.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.067
She does?
Yup, she said that
you look pompous

06:40.067 --> 06:42.333
and that she wanted
to punch right in
the middle of your face.

06:42.333 --> 06:44.067
She said it like that?
Like that.

06:44.067 --> 06:45.700
But you know,
I can't probably
say more because

06:45.700 --> 06:48.800
of the sanctity of the
parent-teacher conference.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.333
But remember,
it's for Wendy.

06:51.333 --> 06:53.700
So that's the apartment
I was thinking about getting.
Oh, that's nice.

06:53.700 --> 06:55.667
(George clears throat)
Yo, what the--

06:55.667 --> 06:57.067
What the hell
are you wearing?!

06:57.067 --> 06:58.400
Lori bought this for me.

06:58.400 --> 06:59.867
We're going to
Costa Rica this weekend.

06:59.867 --> 07:01.867
You look like something
from "Caddyshack II."

07:01.867 --> 07:04.467
Yo, hold up, this weekend?
It's Laker-Cavs.

07:04.467 --> 07:05.600
You have
courtside tickets.

07:05.600 --> 07:06.700
I can watch it
over there,

07:06.700 --> 07:08.100
somewhere in a bar,
somewhere.

07:08.100 --> 07:09.667
But you've been looking
forward to that game.

07:09.667 --> 07:11.200
Yeah, well,
you know, slightly.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.067
But this is the weekend
she wanted to go
and, you know,

07:13.067 --> 07:14.400
she got the plane
and everything.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.733
Without telling you?

07:15.733 --> 07:18.867
No, come on,
she told me last night.

07:18.867 --> 07:21.100
What?
She told you last night.

07:21.100 --> 07:23.700
After she saved your ass
at the deposition.

07:23.700 --> 07:25.167
(Hector)
And bought you
another outfit.

07:25.167 --> 07:27.200
I mean, Lori got it
all covered, doesn't she?

07:27.200 --> 07:31.133
Business and pleasure.
Damn, George, you a cuck.

07:31.133 --> 07:34.300
(both)
Cuck, cuck-cuck,
cuck, cuck.

07:34.300 --> 07:38.333
(clucking)

07:38.333 --> 07:39.767
(both clucking)

07:39.767 --> 07:42.300
Okay, okay, first of all,
you guys are clucking

07:42.300 --> 07:44.133
like, roosters,
"cluck"!

07:44.133 --> 07:46.767
It's cuck.
Okay, cuck.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.700
And I'm a man,
I'm an individual.

07:48.700 --> 07:49.900
And I'm not one of those.

07:49.900 --> 07:51.233
Um, yeah,
I think you are.

07:51.233 --> 07:52.900
Uh, you sleep at
her house all the time.

07:52.900 --> 07:54.467
And she's always
picking the restaurant.

07:54.467 --> 07:55.767
And she's always
picking up the tab.

07:55.767 --> 07:56.900
And she got you
dressed like some type

07:56.900 --> 07:58.700
of boy toy
Mexican Ken doll.

07:58.700 --> 08:01.167
Wow, that... that hurts.

08:01.167 --> 08:03.667
Listen, she's 200
times richer than I am.

08:03.667 --> 08:04.867
So, when I'm the wealthy
one in the relationship,

08:04.867 --> 08:06.100
then I'll pay
for everything.

08:06.100 --> 08:07.333
Jefe's right.

08:07.333 --> 08:09.067
Wendy's a powerful
woman of authority, too.

08:09.067 --> 08:10.800
So, when she would tell me
to do something, I did it.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.300
Cuck.
Cuck.

08:12.300 --> 08:15.133
So, okay, you know what?
I handle my business.

08:15.133 --> 08:17.200
I'ma tell her I had
already made other plans.

08:17.200 --> 08:18.867
And that we'll have
to go another time.

08:18.867 --> 08:20.267
She gonna have to
be fine with that.

08:20.267 --> 08:21.367
She'll have to be

08:21.367 --> 08:23.333
because you're the man.

08:23.333 --> 08:25.900
Now, I'm gonna go find
me an apartment
for me and Chandra

08:25.900 --> 08:28.700
because I'm picking it out
and I'm paying for it

08:28.700 --> 08:30.633
because that's
what men do.

08:30.633 --> 08:32.900
Men do, do.
Okay, leave me
hanging.

08:32.900 --> 08:34.400
Shit, Triumph Seekers!

08:34.400 --> 08:36.567
I told those fools
to come back another time.

08:36.567 --> 08:38.367
Shit, Manolo, damn!

08:38.367 --> 08:40.567
Listen, I'm not
living in fear
of these guys anymore.

08:40.567 --> 08:42.067
I'ma go talk to them.

08:42.067 --> 08:45.733
Dressed like a guy that
sells paletas in the park.

08:47.533 --> 08:50.233
We need to speak
with Manolo.

08:50.233 --> 08:51.967
Manolo's not here.

08:51.967 --> 08:54.667
That's funny because we just
saw him go into this house.

08:54.667 --> 08:57.533
Which means the Lord saw him
go into this house.

08:57.533 --> 08:58.667
But, you know,
he's not here, okay.

08:58.667 --> 09:00.200
I'm telling you
he's not here.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.600
So, I'd appreciate it
if both of you would just,

09:01.600 --> 09:03.400
you know, move it along.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.400
Yeah, we'll move it along
to salvation and peace.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.200
Wouldn't that feel good?

09:08.200 --> 09:12.700
Joy instead of pain?
Love instead of doubt?

09:12.700 --> 09:15.667
All your burdens lifted?

09:15.667 --> 09:17.367
Yeah, I mean,
come on, of course.

09:17.367 --> 09:19.633
George Lopez,
let Jesus Christ
into your heart.

09:19.633 --> 09:21.400
How'd he know my name?

09:21.400 --> 09:22.967
Because you're famous.

09:22.967 --> 09:24.500
But that doesn't
lift the burden.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.333
It only
makes it heavier.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.567
That's true, it does.

09:28.567 --> 09:32.233
On a daily basis, bro,
it is so--

09:32.233 --> 09:33.800
You guys don't blink.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.567
Oh! I always heard that
you guys didn't blink.

09:35.567 --> 09:37.400
And you don't,
that's-- damn.

09:37.400 --> 09:40.800
How would you like to
not have to worry
about anything again?

09:40.800 --> 09:42.467
The Lord can take
care of everything.

09:42.467 --> 09:45.567
Take care of everything?

09:45.567 --> 09:47.333
Everything, wow...

09:47.333 --> 09:48.900
Ev...

09:48.900 --> 09:52.167
(laughing)
You guys almost got me!

09:52.167 --> 09:53.633
Wow! Man!

09:53.633 --> 09:54.700
Come back at Halloween.

09:54.700 --> 09:57.833
I give out
full-size candies.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.067
Thank you, Olly, so much
for coming with me.

10:02.067 --> 10:03.833
Like, I really need
a woman's point of view.

10:03.833 --> 10:05.400
Chandra will be here
in a couple of days,

10:05.400 --> 10:07.567
and I want to have a place
locked down by then, okay?

10:07.567 --> 10:09.167
(phone ringing)

10:09.167 --> 10:10.433
What is this?

10:10.433 --> 10:12.133
Oh, Pfeiffer!

10:12.133 --> 10:14.200
I really need to
find my own place, too.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.333
But that's not why
I brought you to--

10:16.333 --> 10:17.767
You'll love
this apartment.

10:17.767 --> 10:19.100
The floors actually
have radiant heat.

10:19.100 --> 10:20.667
I don't know what that means

10:20.667 --> 10:22.700
but it sounds like
something I must have.

10:22.700 --> 10:24.167
Dammit, Pfeiffer,
I told you

10:24.167 --> 10:25.700
Rachel and Jason
would find out about
each other.

10:25.700 --> 10:28.333
It's cool, sis, I already
have a prob solve.

10:28.333 --> 10:30.433
A "prob solve".
What does that even mean?

10:30.433 --> 10:32.867
It means that Rachel,
Jason and I

10:32.867 --> 10:34.900
are going to Palm Springs
for the weekend.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.400
(Olly)
Wait, the three of you are
going away for the weekend?

10:37.400 --> 10:39.633
Mm-hmm.
Well, what about
Jason's wife?

10:39.633 --> 10:41.500
She'd never go for it.

10:41.500 --> 10:42.767
Apparently, that's
part of the problem.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.700
What? No!

10:44.700 --> 10:48.000
No three-ways,
no two-ways, no anal.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.967
I swear, Pfeiffer,
if you screw up my show--

10:49.967 --> 10:52.100
Oh! It's all good, bye!

10:52.100 --> 10:54.433
Ugh!

10:54.433 --> 10:56.133
Oh, you heard that?

10:56.133 --> 10:58.800
Living with my sister,
you know, at home.

10:58.800 --> 11:01.067
You have no idea.
I live with my sister.

11:01.067 --> 11:03.333
Yeah, but I'm sure
she's lovely.

11:03.333 --> 11:06.367
You know, not off
having sex weekends
in the desert.

11:06.367 --> 11:08.100
She has
cerebral palsy.

11:08.100 --> 11:11.100
Mmm.
Of course she does.

11:11.100 --> 11:13.200
**

11:13.200 --> 11:14.633
Good morning.

11:14.633 --> 11:16.367
Good morning.

11:16.367 --> 11:18.267
It's a great morning.

11:18.267 --> 11:19.533
Yeah.

11:19.533 --> 11:23.067
Oh, I got you... this.

11:23.067 --> 11:24.733
Ah, because you have been

11:24.733 --> 11:28.533
spending so much
time here.

11:28.533 --> 11:29.967
You're dressing me
up again.

11:29.967 --> 11:30.967
Yeah.

11:30.967 --> 11:32.700
Wow, that's...
beautiful.

11:32.700 --> 11:34.067
Uh, Lori, listen.

11:34.067 --> 11:35.300
I-- I know that
we talked about

11:35.300 --> 11:37.200
going to Costa Rica
this weekend.

11:37.200 --> 11:38.900
Mm-hmm, oh, you are gonna
love it down there.

11:38.900 --> 11:42.067
And I booked you
a mani-pedi on the beach.

11:42.067 --> 11:43.800
It sounds amazing
but, you know,
this Saturday,

11:43.800 --> 11:47.100
the Lakers and Cavs
are playing
at Staples Center.

11:47.100 --> 11:48.367
You like LeBron James,
don't you?

11:48.367 --> 11:49.833
Oh, I love LeBron.

11:49.833 --> 11:51.567
He bought 200 of our
cordless facial toners

11:51.567 --> 11:54.500
as Christmas gifts
for the whole
Cavaliers organization.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.067
Oh, that's nice.

11:56.067 --> 11:57.800
Well, you can caress
his cheeks Saturday

11:57.800 --> 12:00.633
because I got
courtside seats.

12:00.633 --> 12:04.367
And, I thought
maybe we could
have dinner afterwards.

12:04.367 --> 12:06.867
And I booked us a suite
at the Ritz-Carlton.

12:06.867 --> 12:10.067
George, you are
so thoughtful.

12:10.067 --> 12:11.533
But we can watch the game
on the beach

12:11.533 --> 12:14.800
at my villa in Papagayo.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.067
Yeah, okay,
but don't you wanna

12:17.067 --> 12:20.533
feel the joy of seeing
LeBron in person?

12:20.533 --> 12:23.600
Uh, I get that you do.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.100
Mmm.

12:25.100 --> 12:27.333
Let go of your burden.

12:27.333 --> 12:31.200
Open your heart
and open your soul

12:31.200 --> 12:33.100
to steaks
after the game

12:33.100 --> 12:37.533
and a suite
at the Ritz-Carlton.

12:37.533 --> 12:38.833
Say this
with me, Lori.

12:38.833 --> 12:41.067
Okay.
I wanna go

12:41.067 --> 12:45.567
to the Lakers
and the Cavs
game on Saturday.

12:45.567 --> 12:47.900
Uh, um...
I wanna go

12:47.900 --> 12:51.400
see the Lakers
and the Cavs game
on Saturday.

12:54.467 --> 12:56.400
Yeah.

12:59.467 --> 13:02.900
So, Lori is coming
to the game with me,
no problem.

13:02.900 --> 13:04.767
I knew you weren't
a cuck, jefe.

13:04.767 --> 13:06.067
So where to?

13:06.067 --> 13:07.900
Uh, where to?
Let's see, oh...

13:07.900 --> 13:09.400
You know, I was
thinking about trying
that new ice cream place.

13:09.400 --> 13:10.933
You like ice cream, right?
Yeah.

13:10.933 --> 13:12.900
Yeah, uh, you know what,
let me drive.

13:12.900 --> 13:14.633
Huh? Try something new.

13:14.633 --> 13:18.733
You can't see, blind bat.

13:18.733 --> 13:19.967
Yeah, they got a lot of

13:19.967 --> 13:22.567
assorted, uh,
colors and flavors.

13:22.567 --> 13:24.300
Where is it?

13:24.300 --> 13:26.933
Uh, right there
on Southern,
like, 1161...

13:26.933 --> 13:30.200
Laser surgery!
(screeches)

13:30.200 --> 13:31.700
Why can't
I just wear glasses?

13:31.700 --> 13:33.200
Okay, first of all,
lower your voice.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.200
Your in a professional
medical building.

13:35.200 --> 13:38.900
And secondly,
I told you, every time
Wendy sees you in glasses,

13:38.900 --> 13:41.933
she wants to
strangle you, okay?

13:41.933 --> 13:45.300
Now just relax.
Lean back.

13:45.300 --> 13:48.600
There you go,
one down.

13:48.600 --> 13:50.367
Piece of cake,
right?

13:50.367 --> 13:53.200
Yeah, that wasn't too bad.
The Valium helps.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.100
Before you know it,
we'll have you
with 20/20 vision.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.433
Onto to eye
numero dos.

13:57.433 --> 14:00.067
You hear that, Manolo?
No more glasses.

14:00.067 --> 14:03.933
Okay, this'll take
just a few seconds.

14:03.933 --> 14:07.500
Uh-oh, abort.
Abort!

14:07.500 --> 14:10.600
Ow!
Manolo... ow!

14:14.467 --> 14:16.767
But he said in a week
or ten days,
he'll be 20/20.

14:16.767 --> 14:19.167
Poor guy, hmm.
Who said that?

14:19.167 --> 14:20.433
All right,
take it easy.

14:20.433 --> 14:21.900
That's-- that's
Maronzio, all right?

14:21.900 --> 14:24.067
Here, drink your--
drink your juice

14:24.067 --> 14:25.267
right there
in front of you, good.

14:25.267 --> 14:27.333
Why does he have
bandages on both eyes?

14:27.333 --> 14:29.400
The doctor decided
to cover both eyes

14:29.400 --> 14:31.867
or it could cause too much
strain or imbalance.

14:31.867 --> 14:34.233
(whispers)
George...

14:34.233 --> 14:35.867
What about
his final exam?

14:35.867 --> 14:37.733
He won't be able
to graduate.

14:37.733 --> 14:39.833
Yeah, I-- I know,
we gotta figure
something out.

14:39.833 --> 14:41.067
Who said that?

14:41.067 --> 14:42.400
Oh, that's--
that's us.

14:42.400 --> 14:43.933
All right, here,
give me that juice.

14:43.933 --> 14:45.533
You're good, don't
worry about it, relax.

14:45.533 --> 14:47.167
Hey, but on the Lori front,
check this out, good news.

14:47.167 --> 14:49.800
We're going to the Laker
game so no more cucky.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.200
There you go,
George, huh?

14:51.200 --> 14:52.400
You the man.
That's right.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.333
You take charge.
That's right.

14:54.333 --> 14:56.067
Yeah, dude.

14:56.067 --> 14:58.567
Hell, yeah!

14:58.567 --> 15:00.367
Oh.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.167
Welcome,
those are for you.

15:02.167 --> 15:05.167
Thank you.
Oh.
Hug.

15:05.167 --> 15:07.300
Can't believe you
sent a limo for me.

15:07.300 --> 15:08.733
Very different
from the two times

15:08.733 --> 15:10.100
you forgot to
even pick me up.

15:10.100 --> 15:11.967
Times are changing,
my dear.

15:11.967 --> 15:14.067
Check this out.

15:14.067 --> 15:17.100
Oh, what-- stepping
up your game a little.

15:17.100 --> 15:20.067
Hey!
Nice, open entrance.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.200
What do you think?

15:24.200 --> 15:25.733
Amazing, right?
Hmm.

15:25.733 --> 15:27.367
Right?
It's beautiful.

15:27.367 --> 15:30.067
I'm so happy you're
doing well, Maronzio.

15:30.067 --> 15:33.100
No, we are doing well.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.067
I got this apartment
for the two of us.

15:35.067 --> 15:37.467
What?
Yeah!

15:37.467 --> 15:39.867
I've thought about it.
This is what I want.

15:39.867 --> 15:41.400
For you and me to
be together again.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.700
To start fresh!

15:42.700 --> 15:44.200
Maronzio,
I can't remember

15:44.200 --> 15:46.500
when we were last
in the same time zone.

15:46.500 --> 15:47.900
But we are now.

15:47.900 --> 15:50.667
Really? Now you're
doing all this?

15:50.667 --> 15:52.867
All these years
you won't there for me.

15:52.867 --> 15:55.500
You weren't there
for the kids'
birthdays, graduations...

15:55.500 --> 15:56.433
But I'm here now!

15:56.433 --> 15:58.867
Like, look
at this apartment!

15:58.867 --> 16:00.933
The floors have radiant heat.

16:00.933 --> 16:03.267
It's radiant heat!

16:03.267 --> 16:05.533
You got an apartment
without talking to me!

16:05.533 --> 16:06.833
And?
Selfish.

16:06.833 --> 16:09.667
I have a job and a life
3,000 miles away.

16:09.667 --> 16:11.500
Maronzio, when we
first got together,

16:11.500 --> 16:13.800
you managed
a rental car agency.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.333
I could wrap my mind
around that.

16:15.333 --> 16:17.600
Then you had your dream
and I supported you.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.333
But what became clear
was that you cared more

16:20.333 --> 16:22.267
about your dream
than you did about me.

16:22.267 --> 16:25.067
I've done some
things I regret.

16:25.067 --> 16:27.100
You just said some
things you regret.

16:27.100 --> 16:29.933
But now we can move on.

16:29.933 --> 16:31.900
We can find a new
apartment together.

16:31.900 --> 16:36.100
Maronzio, I came out here
to tell you in person.

16:36.100 --> 16:37.500
I'm getting married.

16:37.500 --> 16:40.733
Yeah, to me!

16:40.733 --> 16:42.367
Mm-mmh.

16:45.733 --> 16:47.300
(Lori)
Hey, honey.

16:47.300 --> 16:49.067
I was gonna
pick you up.

16:49.067 --> 16:52.600
Look, I got you your
own Lakers jersey.

16:52.600 --> 16:55.200
Change of plans.
We're going to Costa Rica.

16:58.700 --> 17:00.133
Wait a minute,
we talked about this.

17:00.133 --> 17:01.467
George, I have
a private beach.

17:01.467 --> 17:03.300
I flew down our
favorite chef.

17:03.300 --> 17:05.100
And my plane is
waiting in Van Nuys.

17:05.100 --> 17:06.400
So, we should get going.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.500
No, I don't
wanna do that.

17:08.500 --> 17:11.400
Because, look,
we're always doing
things your way.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.933
That German concert,
Disney Hall,

17:13.933 --> 17:15.333
the restaurants
you pick.

17:15.333 --> 17:17.067
Hell, you own 'em.

17:17.067 --> 17:21.467
Tonight, I wanna
do something my way.

17:21.467 --> 17:23.933
This is Richard Branson
all over again.

17:23.933 --> 17:25.567
Everything is
going great.

17:25.567 --> 17:27.233
I feel like
I'm connecting.

17:27.233 --> 17:29.133
And then he can't handle
the fact that I'm who I am.

17:29.133 --> 17:30.767
Richard Branson, the guy
with the airplanes

17:30.767 --> 17:32.067
and rockets and stuff?

17:32.067 --> 17:34.867
And the inability to
let a woman be in charge.

17:34.867 --> 17:38.100
You know, I work
harder and make more
than anyone I date.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.500
But at the end
of the day,

17:39.500 --> 17:41.233
a guy can't feel
like a real man

17:41.233 --> 17:42.667
if a woman is
calling the shots?

17:42.667 --> 17:44.600
I don't think it's
about being a real man.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.267
I think it's just
he doesn't
wanna be a cuck.

17:46.267 --> 17:47.867
A-- a-- a--
a what?

17:47.867 --> 17:50.067
I don't know,
it's nothing.
Don't, it's--

17:50.067 --> 17:51.900
I really care
about you, George.

17:51.900 --> 17:55.067
Yes, Lori, and I
care about you.

17:55.067 --> 17:57.067
I can't do this anymore.

17:57.067 --> 17:59.300
I'm-- I'm sorry this
isn't working out.

17:59.300 --> 18:01.767
What do you mean,
that's it?

18:01.767 --> 18:04.767
You're just...
you just quit?

18:04.767 --> 18:08.933
Enjoy the game, George.

18:08.933 --> 18:10.767
(car door closes)

18:10.767 --> 18:12.367
(car starts)

18:12.367 --> 18:13.800
(driving away)

18:13.800 --> 18:16.533
Wow. Ahem.

18:16.533 --> 18:19.333
Sorry about your
girlfriend, jefe.

18:19.333 --> 18:21.467
Yeah, thanks, Manolo.

18:21.467 --> 18:23.333
I'm so depressed, I don't
even feel like drinking.

18:23.333 --> 18:24.600
That's a first.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.533
I shoulda took you
to the game.

18:26.533 --> 18:28.900
No, you know what,
it would've been like
rubbing salt in the wound.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.967
I thought you were supposed
to pour salt in the wound.

18:30.967 --> 18:32.367
That's lucky, right?

18:32.367 --> 18:36.433
Yeah, sure.

18:36.433 --> 18:39.267
Hmm, you couldn't
go to the game

18:39.267 --> 18:40.933
because you have to
prepare for your final.

18:40.933 --> 18:42.333
But I can't even see.

18:42.333 --> 18:43.900
Mm-hmm, I know.

18:43.900 --> 18:46.567
That's why I got
a surprise for you.

18:46.567 --> 18:48.333
I got you a tutor.
Hello, Manolo.

18:48.333 --> 18:50.633
Miss Wendy!
(chuckling)

18:50.633 --> 18:52.200
Let's get to work.
(doorbell chimes)

18:52.200 --> 18:54.267
Let's get to work, baby.
(knocking on door)

18:54.267 --> 18:55.433
I'll get that.

18:55.433 --> 18:57.100
It's good to see you.

18:57.100 --> 18:58.533
I'm coming.

18:58.533 --> 19:02.167
Hey, if these are Triumph
Seekers, I'm in no mood!

19:02.167 --> 19:04.500
What's going on?
What are you doing here?

19:04.500 --> 19:06.067
(clears throat)

19:06.067 --> 19:07.767
Trouble, George.

19:07.767 --> 19:10.433
You know Jason Turner,
our network exec
on "Valleys"?

19:10.433 --> 19:11.667
Yeah, the skinny dude.

19:11.667 --> 19:13.133
Well, his wife
discovered

19:13.133 --> 19:14.833
that he was
cheating on her

19:14.833 --> 19:17.567
with my sister and our
creative exec, Rachel.

19:17.567 --> 19:18.733
Wait a minute,
all three of them?

19:18.733 --> 19:20.067
Well, technically,
he was only

19:20.067 --> 19:21.433
cheating
with Pfeiffer.

19:21.433 --> 19:23.367
But because Pfeiffer
was having sex
with Rachel

19:23.367 --> 19:25.367
at the exact same time,
the distinction was
lost on Jason's wife.

19:25.367 --> 19:26.933
I don't care about that.

19:26.933 --> 19:29.267
What does that have to
do with "Valleys"?
Everything.

19:29.267 --> 19:30.767
The network
shit-canned him.

19:30.767 --> 19:32.367
They fired him
for having an affair?

19:32.367 --> 19:34.267
For having an affair
that went very bad,

19:34.267 --> 19:36.367
very publicly,
and involved employees.

19:36.367 --> 19:39.400
ABC has very clear
codes of conduct
about this kind of thing.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.133
Well...
what does that mean?

19:41.133 --> 19:42.833
Like, that it
could be over?

19:42.833 --> 19:44.367
Who knows?

19:44.367 --> 19:46.333
I don't even know
if there still is
a "Valleys".

19:46.333 --> 19:49.267
Okay, wait...
Now you're talking crazy.

19:49.267 --> 19:51.133
I need a drink.

19:51.133 --> 19:53.433
Well, yeah.

19:53.433 --> 19:54.967
The whole world's
crumbling.

19:54.967 --> 19:56.133
Hey, Manolo,
make her a drink!

19:56.133 --> 19:57.333
(Manolo)
Can't see!

19:57.333 --> 19:58.733
Feel around for the ice.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.467
* Unh, yeah, yeah *

20:02.467 --> 20:04.467
* That's right, come on,
come on, come on *

20:04.467 --> 20:06.767
* Unh, yeah, yeah *

20:06.767 --> 20:09.600
* Come on, oh
Come on, oh *

20:09.600 --> 20:12.533
**

20:17.533 --> 20:19.767
* Get your hands up,
get your hands up *

20:19.767 --> 20:21.900
* Get your hands up,
get your hands up *

20:21.900 --> 20:24.400
* Get your hands up,
get your hands up *

20:24.400 --> 20:27.233
* Go, go, go, go **

20:27.233 --> 20:29.367
**
