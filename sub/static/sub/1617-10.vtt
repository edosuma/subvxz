Same with my guy at Interpol.
They both say the same thing.

- I do, from experience.
- I told you to get out of there.

34:24.679 --> 34:28.764
And I told you
that we could save the building.

34:28.960 --> 34:30.405
But you got scared.

34:31.239 --> 34:36.485
You lost your nerve.
You left me in there to die.

34:36.639 --> 34:40.360
- How did you get out?
- I was pulled from the wreckage.

34:40.520 --> 34:44.730
Listed as a John Doe in the burn unit.
In a coma for months.

34:44.880 --> 34:50.489
When I woke up
and saw what was left of who I was...

34:51.719 --> 34:53.848
...I only had one thought:

34:54.000 --> 34:58.528
To leave you as alone as you left me.

35:08.160 --> 35:09.605
Now it's your turn.

35:26.640 --> 35:27.766
ARROW:
Go.

35:27.920 --> 35:29.001
It's over.

35:32.800 --> 35:35.406
I'm not afraid to die.

35:35.560 --> 35:37.050
I know.

35:39.800 --> 35:41.245
You're afraid to live.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.004
Let me get you out of here.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.729
Lynns“.

35:46.880 --> 35:48.245
...let me get you help.

35:53.480 --> 35:55.084
Thanks.

35:59.400 --> 36:01.767
- But I'm already burned.
- Lynns, don't do it.

36:18.120 --> 36:21.249
WOMAN [ON TV]: Eyewitnesses contend
that numerous lives would have been lost...

36:21.400 --> 36:24.006
...if not for the timely intervention
of the vigilante.

36:24.200 --> 36:26.362
But these were not the actions
of a vigilante.

36:26.960 --> 36:30.885
What's been described
are the actions of a hero.

36:32.640 --> 36:36.201
What's got you all smiley?
Your new club's a briquette.

36:36.360 --> 36:40.081
It was under construction before.
Now it's just more under construction.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.208
MOIRA:
Good morning.

36:42.360 --> 36:44.283
Sharp suit, Mom.

36:44.440 --> 36:47.523
Not used to seeing you without
your bedroom wrapped around you.

36:47.720 --> 36:50.963
Well, I could hardly go
to the office in my pajamas.

36:51.560 --> 36:53.608
I'm taking Walter's position at the office.

36:55.000 --> 37:00.040
- What changed your mind?
- Not what. Who.

37:00.960 --> 37:02.007
My daughter.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.769
My family.

37:07.480 --> 37:11.724
And I promise you,
Walter will get back to us.

37:11.880 --> 37:14.850
I will keep looking for him
and I will find him.

37:15.040 --> 37:17.691
- And I'll see you for dinner.
OLIVER: Mm-hm.

37:23.120 --> 37:26.761
- What?
- Just feeling the whiplash.

37:26.920 --> 37:30.447
She went from shut-in
to chairman pretty fast.

37:31.320 --> 37:35.166
- Sounds like you got through to her.
- Yeah, I guess.

37:36.640 --> 37:42.363
It'll just be for a few months.
My mom, she's taking it so hard.

37:42.520 --> 37:45.046
Whatever you have to do
to take care of your family.

37:47.480 --> 37:49.721
Before I forget.

37:56.160 --> 37:57.286
My brother's badge.

38:01.840 --> 38:08.485
My mom was hoping maybe you could
find a way to get it to, you know, him.

38:09.200 --> 38:14.001
As a thank-you.
I don't care what anyone has to say.

38:16.880 --> 38:18.689
He really is a guardian angel.

38:21.720 --> 38:24.200
I'll find a way to get it to him.

38:28.760 --> 38:31.286
I'm gonna miss you.

38:33.200 --> 38:34.850
Yeah.

38:41.200 --> 38:42.531
- Hi.
- Hey.

38:42.680 --> 38:45.206
- You look after yourself, all right?
- I will.

38:45.360 --> 38:46.930
Good.

38:49.840 --> 38:53.003
So Joanna's taking
a leave of absence, huh?

38:53.720 --> 38:57.167
- She has to go be with her family.
- Yeah, well, family's important.

38:57.800 --> 39:00.929
- I already apologized.
-It's my turn.

39:01.520 --> 39:03.409
After what happened last night...

39:03.560 --> 39:06.484
...maybe it's a good thing
you got the hood involved.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.681
He didn't take
the phone off you, did he?

39:36.000 --> 39:38.571
Maybe you should hold onto this.

39:40.120 --> 39:44.569
I mean, I may not like the guy's methods,
but whoever this guy is...

39:44.720 --> 39:48.850
...he's got a habit of putting himself
between danger and you.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.241
And that's not something
I can argue with.

39:52.840 --> 39:57.004
Besides,
I shouldn't have this thing anyway.

40:02.080 --> 40:04.731
Kelton, are we good?

40:04.920 --> 40:08.641
I got a strong signal from the crystal
VHF transmitter you hid in the speaker.

40:08.840 --> 40:11.730
- It can't be back-traced.
- Talk to me like a third grader.

40:11.880 --> 40:14.042
Next time your daughter calls
the vigilante...

40:14.200 --> 40:16.248
...we'll be able to listen to every word.

40:18.120 --> 40:20.646
I know you swore
to bring this guy down, detective...

40:20.800 --> 40:24.691
...but using your own daughter as bait,
that's stone cold.

40:29.440 --> 40:30.487
[GRUNTING]

41:22.240 --> 41:25.210
Good thing the fire didn't spread
to down here.

41:31.800 --> 41:35.168
It's one of the benefits of concrete
and steel construction.

41:39.720 --> 41:40.767
Thank you.

41:42.960 --> 41:45.531
- What for?
- You know what for.

41:47.520 --> 41:50.922
- So, what's next? More training?
- No.

41:53.280 --> 41:55.282
We go hunting.
