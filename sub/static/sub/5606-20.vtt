00:29.697 --> 00:32.398
He's keeping his head down,
doing his time.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.333
Why would Gabriel
cut a deal with Shioma

00:34.335 --> 00:35.768
just to turn around
and kill him?

00:35.770 --> 00:37.770

a power play.

I did.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.569
Okay.

04:30.571 --> 04:33.038
Everything all right?

04:34.742 --> 04:36.441
Did you know
Gabriel Waincroft

04:36.443 --> 04:38.343
went to visit Adam
three months ago?

04:40.281 --> 04:42.381
Who told you that?

04:42.383 --> 04:44.549
Warden Grier.

04:44.551 --> 04:46.652
He was investigating
a cyber breach and found

04:46.654 --> 04:49.721
there was a visitor that had
been deleted from their logs.

04:49.723 --> 04:52.457
And when they looked at the
video, they saw it was Gabriel.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.493
He used an alias
to get inside.

04:54.495 --> 04:57.429
Why wouldn't Adam tell you
if Gabriel came to visit him?

04:57.431 --> 04:59.498
I asked him the same thing.

05:01.302 --> 05:03.769
He said he didn't
want me to worry.

05:03.771 --> 05:06.371
That if Gabriel could have
a sit-down with him in prison,

05:06.373 --> 05:07.906
he could easily have him killed.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.411
Well, what did
Gabriel want?

05:12.413 --> 05:14.880
He told Adam that he had
taken care of Shioma.

05:14.882 --> 05:16.982
That it was only
a matter of time

05:16.984 --> 05:19.951
before all the other families
would be out of his way.

05:19.953 --> 05:23.322
But what he really needed
to grow his business

05:23.324 --> 05:25.390
was someone who understood
how things operated.

05:25.392 --> 05:27.025
He was offering
him a job.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.497
Adam turned it down, though.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.335
Do you believe him?

05:36.337 --> 05:39.371
Of course.

05:41.342 --> 05:44.509
Kono, if you believe him,
then why are we here?

05:56.490 --> 05:59.024
ERIC:
<i> Hey! H-Hold the elevator!</i>

05:59.026 --> 06:01.927
Pregnant lady! Pregnant lady!
Hold the elevator!

06:02.896 --> 06:05.764
Congratulations.
When are you due?

06:05.766 --> 06:07.666
(chuckles): Yeah
I know. Uncool.

06:07.668 --> 06:10.402
Uh, but I've already been late
to work three times this week.

06:10.404 --> 06:13.572
Oh, impressive,
considering it's only Tuesday.

06:13.574 --> 06:14.940
Ah.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.441
Look at that.

06:16.443 --> 06:18.910
Must be fate.
Mm.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.980
You know, some people might
call it coincidence, but not me.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.649
I'm a big believer in
the laws of probability.

06:24.651 --> 06:27.052
You know, game theory.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.420
Steve Nash.

06:28.422 --> 06:30.922
I think you mean John Nash.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.658
And game theory is more about
mathematical strategy

06:33.660 --> 06:35.527
than probability.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.662
You sure?

06:37.664 --> 06:39.498
Yup.

06:41.468 --> 06:43.935
Totally just crashed and
burned there, didn't I?

06:43.937 --> 06:47.506
Passing yourself off
as a pregnant woman

06:47.508 --> 06:49.541
wasn't the strongest
opening move.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.543
Yeah, yeah.
Strategically speaking.

06:51.545 --> 06:52.978
Ah, I see what
you did there.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.579
If it's any consolation,

06:54.581 --> 06:56.114
we'll probably never
see each other again.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.449
Yeah. Whew.

06:57.450 --> 06:58.783
(elevator bell dings)
What a relief.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.485
Right.

07:00.487 --> 07:01.887
After you.

07:01.889 --> 07:04.756
(quietly): Steve Nash is
a basketball player, you idiot.

07:04.758 --> 07:05.824
Are you following me?

07:05.826 --> 07:07.426
What? No way.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.661
I work here, so it's sort of
like you're following me,

07:09.663 --> 07:11.630
if you think about it.

07:11.631 --> 07:13.598
So much for never
seeing each other again.

07:15.669 --> 07:16.768
Um, excuse me.
I'm sorry.

07:16.770 --> 07:17.969
Wh-What are you
doing here exactly?

07:17.971 --> 07:19.738
Chunk!

07:19.740 --> 07:21.740
Jer-bear. So good
to finally see you!

07:22.776 --> 07:23.909
Oh, guys.

07:23.910 --> 07:25.043
I want you to meet
my baby sister Isabel.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.528
Isabel, these are my colleagues:

07:26.529 --> 07:28.012
Steve McGarrett,
Danny Williams and Lou Grover.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.448
Hi.
Hi.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.116
Uh, it's so good
to finally meet you.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.535
Jerry's told me all about you.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.953
Yeah, you, too. He's talked
a lot about you, too... Chunk.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.522
(chuckles) GROVER: Chunk, huh?

07:37.524 --> 07:39.191
Uh, I was kind of
a chunky baby.

07:39.193 --> 07:41.360
(scoffs) Kind of?

07:41.361 --> 07:43.528
12 pounds is still a record
in the Ortega family.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.730
12 pounds? Should've seen
the size of her diapers.

07:45.732 --> 07:47.833
Okay, Jer, I think
they get the point.

07:47.835 --> 07:50.235
Uh, Jerry tells us
you're at UCLA Law.

07:50.237 --> 07:51.236
That's-that's impressive.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.138
Congratulations.
Thanks.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.173
One more year,
and she'll be Counselor Ortega.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.008
How long you, uh,
you gonna be in town?

07:57.010 --> 07:58.143
Oh, just a few days.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.744
I had some time
over spring break

07:59.746 --> 08:02.247
and thought I'd come home
and see my big bro.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.682
I'm sorry,
can we hold on a second,

08:03.684 --> 08:05.084
back it up a few beats?

08:05.085 --> 08:06.485
I need a little
clarity on something.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.053
(clears throat)

08:08.055 --> 08:09.621
Um, you two are related?

08:09.623 --> 08:11.122
Like, biologically?

08:11.124 --> 08:12.757
Oh, yeah, that's Eric.

08:12.759 --> 08:14.059
We've met.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.627
Yeah, this is
my nephew.

08:15.629 --> 08:16.795
Maybe not biologically;

08:16.797 --> 08:18.763
we're gonna do some
tests and find out.

08:18.765 --> 08:20.165
(chuckles)
Cold, Uncle D.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.167
Uncle Danny.
Okay? Okay? Okay?

08:22.169 --> 08:24.102
Look, I just said
what we're all thinking, right?

08:25.772 --> 08:27.739
You got somewhere
to be or something?

08:27.741 --> 08:29.207
Uh, isn't there
some very important security...

08:29.209 --> 08:30.609
There you go.
Thanks.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.077
JERRY: Oh. You're not
gonna believe it.

08:32.079 --> 08:33.979
Someone released an elephant
from the circus last night,

08:33.981 --> 08:35.780
and HPD still
hasn't found it.

08:35.782 --> 08:37.516
I heard about that on the news.

08:37.518 --> 08:38.817
Anyone hurt?

08:38.819 --> 08:40.285
Thankfully, no.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.053
Normally, we don't work
the Ace Ventura beat,

08:42.055 --> 08:43.188
but HPD asked us

08:43.190 --> 08:44.623
to help out,

08:44.625 --> 08:46.892
since the elephant's
a danger to the public.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.560
I'm gonna make
a bold prediction:

08:48.562 --> 08:50.061
somebody grabbed
this elephant, okay?

08:50.063 --> 08:51.796
Nothing that big

08:51.798 --> 08:54.065
ever disappears
into thin air.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.667
Maybe we should call TSA.

08:55.669 --> 08:58.069
You know, see if
David Copperfield is on island.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.304
You know,

08:59.306 --> 09:01.773
'cause he's an illusionist.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.975
No, we get it.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.010
(clears throat)

09:05.012 --> 09:06.311
Damn, I'm having
a rough morning.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.313
Hey, Eric, why don't you,
uh, why don't you

09:08.315 --> 09:09.915
go to your office
and scrub that footage,

09:09.917 --> 09:11.783
see if you can help us
I.D. a suspect?

09:11.785 --> 09:12.851
Absolutely.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.386
Okay. All right.
I'm on it.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.920
All right, well,
we're off to the Batcave.

09:15.923 --> 09:17.822
Gonna show Isabel where
the real magic happens.

09:17.824 --> 09:18.957
Nice to meet you.

09:18.959 --> 09:19.991
GROVER:
And off they go

09:19.993 --> 09:22.160
down to the basement.

09:22.162 --> 09:25.230
You got to admire
his enthusiasm.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.065
Oh, come on, McGarrett.

09:27.067 --> 09:30.101
You know you need to go on
and give homeboy his badge.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.020
You nuts?
This guy believes in aliens.

09:32.021 --> 09:33.938
(phone ringing) You want to give
him authority over sane people?

09:33.941 --> 09:35.874
I didn't say give him a gun.

09:35.876 --> 09:38.043
McGarrett. (clears throat)

09:38.045 --> 09:39.945
Yup, we're on the way. Danny.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.853
Wait up, guys!

09:48.855 --> 09:50.589
(small motor running)

09:51.858 --> 09:53.058
(motor stops)

09:53.060 --> 09:54.843
Jerry, what are
you doing here?

09:54.844 --> 09:56.627
Thought you were giving
Isabel a tour of the Batcave.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.296
Well, I was, until I heard

09:58.298 --> 10:00.265
we had a murder victim
at Universal Exports.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.633
Wasn't gonna miss this.

10:01.635 --> 10:02.601
Why?

10:02.603 --> 10:05.203
Come on.
You've heard of Area 51?

10:05.205 --> 10:07.005
The Bermuda Triangle?

10:07.007 --> 10:08.123
The mob cemetery
under Giants Stadium?

10:08.124 --> 10:09.240
What do these all
have in common?

10:09.242 --> 10:11.610
The whack jobs
that believe in them.

10:11.612 --> 10:12.978
Okay, let me put it this way.

10:12.979 --> 10:14.345
If you're gonna make a list
of totally awesome places

10:14.348 --> 10:15.880
to visit
before you die,

10:15.882 --> 10:18.750
Universal Exports would be
at the top of that list.

10:18.752 --> 10:19.985
Why is that?

10:19.987 --> 10:21.319
You're kidding, right?

10:21.321 --> 10:22.654
I'm not.

10:22.656 --> 10:23.722
Jerry, just tell us,

10:23.724 --> 10:24.923
tell us
what you're talking about.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.858
Why is this place
so awesome?

10:26.860 --> 10:29.094
No spoilers.
You'll thank me later.

10:29.096 --> 10:31.262
Hey, guys,
we're in here.

10:32.366 --> 10:34.666
It looks pretty amazing so far.

10:35.702 --> 10:37.068
(camera clicking)

10:39.006 --> 10:40.739
Who is he?

10:40.741 --> 10:42.907
David Makana. He's the overnight
security guard.

10:42.909 --> 10:44.275
His body was discovered
this morning

10:44.277 --> 10:46.277
when the daytime guard
came in for his shift.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.912
C.O.D. is a close-range GSW

10:47.914 --> 10:49.681
to the back of the head--
no witnesses.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.783
All right, this guy's gun
is still in his holster.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.852
Whoever did this must have
got the jump on him.

10:53.854 --> 10:56.321
Or maybe he knew his attacker.
What else do we know?

10:56.323 --> 10:58.023
Well, Makana's retinal scan

10:58.025 --> 11:00.959
was used to access the
facility at 11:32 p.m.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.260
We're thinking our perp
used him to get inside,

11:02.262 --> 11:04.012
then executed him.

11:04.013 --> 11:05.763
We got any idea what
these guys were after?

11:05.766 --> 11:08.400
No, CEO is on his way down
to talk to us now.

11:08.402 --> 11:11.236
So far, everyone we've talked to
hasn't really given us much.

11:11.238 --> 11:12.804
JERRY:
Makes sense.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.906
They don't want us to know
what they're working on here.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.207
You've been here before, Jer?

11:16.209 --> 11:18.677
No, he wishes he had though.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.078
Come on, guys,
this is simple math.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.047
Who employs round-the-clock
armed security

11:22.049 --> 11:24.949
and biometric entry
for an export business?

11:24.951 --> 11:27.152
This place is a front

11:27.154 --> 11:28.386
for a top-secret
defense contractor.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.121
We're talking
next-gen tech,

11:30.123 --> 11:32.757
highly-classified
Q Branch stuff.

11:32.759 --> 11:34.359
You know, he's got a point.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.161
Mahalo, Chin.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.228
Sorry to keep you waiting.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.830
I'm Clark Brighton,
the CEO here.

11:38.831 --> 11:40.431
I was hoping to provide you
with security footage

11:40.434 --> 11:43.435
from last night,
but our system was hacked.

11:43.437 --> 11:45.170
The cameras were deactivated.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.105
Whoever hit us
knew what they were doing.

11:47.107 --> 11:49.374
Okay, Chin, why don't you get
that data over to CSU.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.376
Have them scrub it,
see if they can find

11:51.378 --> 11:52.911
the source of the breach.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.980
That won't be necessary.

11:54.981 --> 11:57.048
My cyber team already attempted
to track down the source.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.384
Unfortunately, it originated
on the Tor network.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.753
It's impossible to trace.

12:01.754 --> 12:04.121
I'm sorry, Mr. Brighton, what
did you say you do here again?

12:04.124 --> 12:07.125
Look, I want
to be helpful, but...

12:07.127 --> 12:08.893
I'm not at liberty
to discuss that.

12:08.895 --> 12:11.329
What I can tell you

12:11.330 --> 12:13.764
is that something very valuable
was stolen from us last night.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.100
Look, we know you're not
an export company,

12:15.102 --> 12:16.768
so why don't you just
save us the double-talk

12:16.770 --> 12:18.136
and tell us what was taken.

12:18.138 --> 12:21.940
I'm afraid I can't tell you that
unless you sign this.

12:24.478 --> 12:26.745
Confidentiality agreement.

12:33.153 --> 12:35.153
Nice signature.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.522
Without a signature,
they can't forge it.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.224
I'm sorry, but can I
see your badge?

12:39.226 --> 12:41.159
Uh, Mr. Ortega is actually
a special consultant

12:41.161 --> 12:43.094
with our task force.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.028
Unfortunately, I can't allow him
through without credentials.

12:45.031 --> 12:47.432
You see?

12:47.434 --> 12:49.100
This is why I need a badge.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.769
Jerry, it's not the time.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.804
It's certainly
not the venue, okay?

12:56.243 --> 12:59.144
Well, at least
tell me one thing.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.282
What does this really do?

13:04.284 --> 13:05.383
(sighs)

13:07.354 --> 13:08.920
It writes.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.188
Follow me please.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.394
Oh, you're good.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.263
Over the past two years,

13:18.265 --> 13:21.466
we've been designing
a prototype tactical suit

13:21.468 --> 13:23.535
for the U.S. military.

13:30.844 --> 13:33.211
This is a scale representation
of what was stolen.

13:38.852 --> 13:41.152
When is this thing
gonna be combat ready?

13:41.154 --> 13:43.087
The suit's fully functional,
Commander.

13:43.089 --> 13:45.023
Our plan is
to have it in theater

13:45.025 --> 13:46.291
within the next three years.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.426
What does something
like this cost?

13:48.428 --> 13:50.495
We've spent $80 million
developing it.

13:50.497 --> 13:53.364
And not to sound
too hyperbolic,

13:53.366 --> 13:56.434
but it is the Holy Grail
of next-gen weapon defense.

13:56.436 --> 13:59.404
Okay, well, then why only
one guard to protect it?

13:59.406 --> 14:01.606
An export company with
too large a security presence

14:01.608 --> 14:03.908
would draw unwanted attention.

14:03.910 --> 14:05.844
Anonymity is our best defense.

14:08.248 --> 14:11.149
STEVE: What are the
suit's capabilities?

14:13.119 --> 14:15.119
The suit's made
of a liquid armor,

14:15.121 --> 14:16.387
which hardens when hit.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.558
This protects the soldier
from lethal impact.

14:20.560 --> 14:23.528
It also monitors vitals,
provides sensor cues,

14:23.530 --> 14:24.996
and enhances the soldier's

14:24.998 --> 14:26.531
overall metabolics.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.866
Something that
sophisticated has also

14:27.868 --> 14:29.100
got to have a
tracking device.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.536
It does, but it was disabled.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.271
Okay, well, only someone
with knowledge of that suit

14:33.273 --> 14:34.405
would know
how to do that.

14:34.407 --> 14:36.007
That's correct.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.575
How many people
know about this thing?

14:37.577 --> 14:41.880
Between investors, developers
and technicians, maybe 20.

14:41.882 --> 14:44.015
All right. We'll need
a list of those names.

14:44.017 --> 14:46.017
Whatever I can do to help.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.518
This suit's worth $80 million.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.554
Whoever stole it
is looking to get paid.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.556
Or they're looking to use it.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.492
I think we should assume
they're gonna use it.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.029
How do we stop it?

14:58.031 --> 14:59.497
You can't.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.199
You saw the test.

15:01.201 --> 15:04.102
The suit's made with
zero vulnerabilities.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.605
It's indestructible.

15:11.278 --> 15:12.977
Great.

15:12.979 --> 15:15.380
So we're chasing
Iron Man.

15:20.654 --> 15:23.054
GROVER:<i> So, I go through</i>
<i> this list of names</i>

15:23.056 --> 15:25.156
that Brighton gave me,

15:25.158 --> 15:28.326
and this guy goes right
to the top of the list. Here.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.629
That is Hugh Foster.

15:31.631 --> 15:34.399
Foster was on
the R&D team

15:34.401 --> 15:36.301
for the suit.

15:36.303 --> 15:40.204
Eight months ago, they catch
this genius shopping around

15:40.206 --> 15:42.573
specs of the suit
to rival companies.

15:42.575 --> 15:45.276
He avoids jail time
by taking a plea deal,

15:45.278 --> 15:50.415
but according to his financials,
he got wiped out with legal fees

15:50.417 --> 15:52.684
and he hasn't had
a job ever since.

15:52.686 --> 15:55.320
Okay, so we got an
ex-employee who's pissed off.

15:55.322 --> 15:56.621
Not only does he have

15:56.623 --> 15:58.489
insider knowledge of the suit,

15:58.491 --> 16:00.358
but he's also
financially motivated.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.060
I will bring him in.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.127
Yeah.

16:05.098 --> 16:06.364
Here it is.

16:06.366 --> 16:07.966
Pretty rad, right?

16:07.968 --> 16:09.968
Very rad, Jer.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.970
I'm really happy for you.

16:11.972 --> 16:13.638
Well, I figured
it was about time

16:13.640 --> 16:15.239
I got out of
Mom's basement.

16:15.241 --> 16:17.575
That and she moved to Maui.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.410
Yeah, that did kind
of force my hand.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.245
Oh, yeah.

16:21.247 --> 16:22.447
(gasps softly)

16:22.449 --> 16:24.382
Makaha Beach.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.284
Yeah, you remember that place?

16:26.286 --> 16:28.169
Of course.

16:28.170 --> 16:30.053
Dad used to take us there
on the weekends.

16:30.056 --> 16:31.306
Remember he bought you

16:31.307 --> 16:32.557
that metal detector
for your birthday,

16:32.559 --> 16:35.593
and you thought you found
an alien time capsule.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.729
Okay, to be fair,
I was only eight years old,

16:37.731 --> 16:40.198
and I'd never seen
a beer keg before.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.599
(chuckles)

16:41.601 --> 16:43.201
Dad loved that spot.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.736
Yeah, a couple times,
he wrote me a doctor's note

16:44.738 --> 16:46.304
and we went there
on a school day.

16:46.306 --> 16:47.739
I didn't know that.

16:47.741 --> 16:49.741
Neither did Mom.

16:49.743 --> 16:51.476
(chuckles)

16:51.478 --> 16:53.478
I miss him a lot.

16:53.480 --> 16:57.015
Yeah, me, too.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.452
He'd be so proud of you.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.223
Oh, look, Jerry, there's
something really important

17:05.225 --> 17:06.691
I need to talk to you about.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.259
Sure, what is it?

17:08.261 --> 17:09.427
Uh...
(phone ringing)

17:09.429 --> 17:11.095
Hold on one second.
Okay.

17:12.298 --> 17:14.365
Special Consultant Jerry Ortega.
How can I help you?

17:14.367 --> 17:16.134
Hi, Eric.

17:17.103 --> 17:19.570
Okay, I'll be right there.

17:19.572 --> 17:21.105
Sorry, sis, duty calls.

17:21.107 --> 17:23.307
Don't worry about it.
We can talk about it later.

17:23.309 --> 17:24.642
You sure?
Absolutely.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.244
I'll be right back.
Okay.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.179
Again.

17:32.719 --> 17:36.788
I told you, I had nothing to do
with the suit going missing.

17:36.790 --> 17:38.790
How stupid do you think I am?

17:38.792 --> 17:41.259
You are definitely stupid
enough to get caught,

17:41.261 --> 17:43.461
uh, trying to sell plans
to a rival company.

17:43.463 --> 17:46.464
Which is exactly why
I would never steal it.

17:46.466 --> 17:49.133
Since I'd be the
obvious suspect.

17:49.135 --> 17:51.469
I mean, it took you
all of, what,

17:51.471 --> 17:53.671
an hour to get to me?

17:53.673 --> 17:56.574
Where were you last night
at around 11:30 p.m.?

17:56.576 --> 17:58.176
Movies.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.578
I caught a late showing at
the Cinezone in Mililani.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.346
You got anybody
to back that up?

18:02.348 --> 18:03.848
No, I went alone.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.716
I don't have many
friends these days

18:05.718 --> 18:07.585
since Brighton
ruined my life.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.754
Okay, so what you're saying is
that you have no real alibi,

18:09.756 --> 18:10.788
but plenty of motive.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.424
Look, I made a mistake.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.493
I almost went to jail for it.

18:15.495 --> 18:18.096
You really think I'd risk
everything a second time?

18:18.098 --> 18:20.364
For $80 million, yes, I do.

18:20.366 --> 18:22.366
If I was sitting on
that kind of payout,

18:22.368 --> 18:24.435
you think you would've
found me on my couch

18:24.437 --> 18:26.437
watching<i> The Price is Right?</i>

18:26.439 --> 18:27.538
If it wasn't you,
it was somebody

18:27.540 --> 18:28.639
you tried to sell
those specs to.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.842
All right? So what
you're gonna do is

18:30.844 --> 18:32.443
you're gonna give us
a list of the names

18:32.445 --> 18:34.178
of all the people
you tried to sell them to,

18:34.180 --> 18:35.580
anybody you mentioned it to;
I don't care

18:35.582 --> 18:37.515
if it was a date
you were trying to impress.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.820
I've been going
through the footage.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.188
Turns out, the
elephant escape

18:44.190 --> 18:45.857
was actually a
botched kidnapping.

18:45.859 --> 18:48.693
Somebody was trying to rescue
the animal from the circus.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.362
(whispering): I did get a
pretty good screen-grab

18:51.364 --> 18:52.897
of one of the
people involved.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.699
(whispering):
That's great.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.300
But why are we whispering?

18:56.302 --> 18:58.202
Because.

18:58.204 --> 18:59.270
Look at this.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.474
It's the only image we have
of the perpetrator.

19:03.476 --> 19:06.210
They're very aware of
the cameras, very prepared.

19:06.212 --> 19:08.713
Until the part where
the elephant got away.

19:08.715 --> 19:11.716
Great, but I thought you said
you got a clear picture of him.

19:11.718 --> 19:13.584
I did.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.453
Right around the time
Dumbo was rampaging

19:15.455 --> 19:17.755
down Kalakaua,
I found this.

19:17.757 --> 19:21.325
Same exact cargo truck
pulls up on Kuhio.

19:21.327 --> 19:24.529
And look who's
driving the truck.

19:26.332 --> 19:27.698
Your sister.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.634
Who else knows about this?

19:29.636 --> 19:30.768
Nobody.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.270
Yet.

19:32.271 --> 19:33.771
But, Jerry, I have a
responsibility to Five-O.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.506
You know this.
I got to tell them.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.175
Eric, I'm just begging you
to hold off.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.609
I know my sister;
this isn't like her.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.311
Just give me a chance
to talk to her

19:40.313 --> 19:41.579
and find out what's going on.

19:44.918 --> 19:47.318
Maybe I can buy you some time.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.519
How?

19:48.521 --> 19:49.654
Oops.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.789
My computer crashed.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.294
Thanks.

19:56.295 --> 19:57.795
GROVER:
Well, Foster's alibi checks out.

19:57.797 --> 20:01.232
He was at the movies at
the time of the break-in.

20:01.234 --> 20:02.500
All right, so this
exonerates Foster.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.268
What about the
companies he gave us?

20:04.270 --> 20:05.636
Still in the process
of clearing them,

20:05.638 --> 20:07.338
but I got to tell
you the truth,

20:07.340 --> 20:09.240
I don't think any of them
are involved either.

20:09.242 --> 20:10.541
Why?

20:10.543 --> 20:13.544
I talked to
the Department of Justice, okay?

20:13.546 --> 20:15.213
They handled
Foster's plea deal.

20:15.215 --> 20:16.948
When Foster started
naming names,

20:16.950 --> 20:19.650
the DOJ started
making pen registers

20:19.652 --> 20:21.886
and wiretaps on
any and everybody

20:21.888 --> 20:23.621
that was attempting
to buy that suit.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.623
If it had been one of
these other companies,

20:25.625 --> 20:27.759
Justice would have known.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.894
So, what? We've just exhausted
our entire list of suspects?

20:29.896 --> 20:32.563
I'm afraid so, partner.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.432
No.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.968
No, w-we got to be
missing something.

20:36.970 --> 20:38.569
That suit didn't just get up

20:38.571 --> 20:41.505
and walk out of
Universal Exports on its own.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.411
(metallic clanking and whirring)

20:53.286 --> 20:54.785
(officers shouting)

21:01.728 --> 21:03.728
♪ ♪

21:08.368 --> 21:10.735

21:24.917 --> 21:26.617
(tires screech)

21:30.290 --> 21:31.922
He's still inside.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.291
Make any demands yet?

21:33.293 --> 21:35.026
Radio silence.

21:39.565 --> 21:40.831
You got anybody in lockup?

21:40.833 --> 21:42.199
Not since last night.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.566
Then what the hell
does he want?

21:43.569 --> 21:45.703
STEVE:
Duke, who's he got with him?

21:45.705 --> 21:47.705
LUKELA:
That's David Atowa.

21:47.707 --> 21:50.041
He's our property clerk,
works in the evidence room.

21:52.011 --> 21:54.512
STEVE: Tell your
men to stand down.

21:54.514 --> 21:56.847
There's no way
they're gonna stop this guy.

21:56.849 --> 21:57.848
Stand down.

21:57.850 --> 21:58.916
I repeat,

21:58.918 --> 22:00.384
hold fire.

22:21.341 --> 22:24.342
My name is
Commander Steve McGarrett.

22:24.344 --> 22:25.609
I'm with Five-O.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.884
Cease fire! Cease fire!

22:33.886 --> 22:36.053
Do not engage! Do not engage!

22:38.558 --> 22:39.957
We're just gonna
let him go?

22:39.959 --> 22:40.991
We got to let him go.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.093
You try to stop that guy,

22:42.095 --> 22:44.028
you're gonna lose
that officer.

22:47.433 --> 22:48.733
All teams, stand down.

22:48.735 --> 22:49.900
Target is free to go.

22:49.902 --> 22:51.702
SWAT LEADER:
Standing down.

22:51.704 --> 22:52.770
OFFICER:
Roger that.

22:55.908 --> 22:57.441
(horn honks)

23:03.649 --> 23:05.483
Yes, this is Commander
Steve McGarrett.

23:05.485 --> 23:07.485
I need an immediate
satellite realignment

23:07.487 --> 23:09.653
and grid coverage
on my position.

23:09.655 --> 23:11.622
Target is a black SUV

23:11.624 --> 23:13.090
leaving my location
now. Grover?

23:13.092 --> 23:14.492
Yeah.

23:16.429 --> 23:18.429
Copy that. Thank you.

23:18.431 --> 23:20.164
Get Chin and Kono down here,
process the scene.

23:20.166 --> 23:22.166
I want to know exactly
why this guy came here,

23:22.168 --> 23:23.968
exactly what he wants.
All right.

23:25.905 --> 23:28.973
Duke, we're gonna get
Officer Atowa back, okay?

23:38.684 --> 23:41.018
ISABEL:
<i> Look, I tried to tell you,</i>

23:41.020 --> 23:42.920
but you kept
getting called away.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.555
Well, obviously you didn't
try hard enough!

23:44.557 --> 23:46.624
And what the hell
were you thinking?

23:46.625 --> 23:48.692
I was thinking about saving
that poor elephant's life.

23:48.694 --> 23:50.661
Oh, so you decided
to kidnap her?

23:50.663 --> 23:53.864
Look, a few years ago, I got
involved with an activist group,

23:53.866 --> 23:55.533
Animals Without Chains.

23:55.534 --> 23:57.201
We help relocate animals
that are being abused.

23:57.203 --> 23:59.136
Oh.

23:59.138 --> 24:01.472
So this is what
the whole trip was about.

24:01.474 --> 24:02.973
Had nothing to do
with seeing me.

24:02.975 --> 24:05.209
Jerry, of course
I wanted to see you,

24:05.211 --> 24:06.710
but Mazie needed my help.

24:06.712 --> 24:08.145
Mazie?
Yes.

24:08.147 --> 24:11.048
The plan was to relocate her
to a sanctuary in Thailand.

24:11.050 --> 24:13.551
She's supposed to be halfway
around the world right now,

24:13.553 --> 24:15.820
and everything was
going fine until...

24:15.822 --> 24:19.457
Till you forgot you were dealing
with a 6,000-pound wild animal!

24:19.459 --> 24:22.726
A car alarm went off as I was
leading her into the truck.

24:22.728 --> 24:23.861
It spooked her.

24:23.863 --> 24:25.629
This has never happened
to me before.

24:25.631 --> 24:27.231
Before?

24:27.232 --> 24:28.832
How many times have you done
something like this?

24:28.835 --> 24:31.235
Enough to know
that it's worth the risk.

24:31.237 --> 24:34.238
These animals are
emotional, sensitive creatures.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.574
You know, they don't deserve
to be kept in captivity

24:36.576 --> 24:37.708
and exploited for profit.

24:37.710 --> 24:39.043
Okay.

24:39.045 --> 24:41.812
On principle, I agree with you.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.781
But you broke the law, Isabel,

24:43.783 --> 24:47.151
and now that elephant is
loose somewhere on the island.

24:48.120 --> 24:51.255
Actually, no.

24:51.257 --> 24:52.823
It isn't.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.836
Jerry, I'd like you
to meet Mazie.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.671
(elephant trumpets)

25:07.673 --> 25:11.709
Mazie, this is
my brother Jerry.

25:12.645 --> 25:14.712
Hello.

25:20.753 --> 25:22.152
(elephant trumpets)
(laughs)

25:23.122 --> 25:26.056
(chuckles)

25:26.058 --> 25:27.658
How'd you get her here?

25:27.660 --> 25:29.793
It wasn't easy.

25:29.795 --> 25:31.996
Okay, look, I was able
to buy you a few hours

25:31.998 --> 25:33.797
before Five-O finds out
you're behind all this,

25:33.799 --> 25:35.733
but they're gonna find out.

25:35.734 --> 25:37.668
Which is why you need to
return Mazie to the circus,

25:37.670 --> 25:39.837
and then we can figure out
some legal way to get her out.

25:39.839 --> 25:41.572
It's not that easy, Jer.

25:41.574 --> 25:43.641
It's almost impossible to get
these animals out of the hands

25:43.643 --> 25:45.276
of the circus.

25:45.278 --> 25:47.778
And when it does happen,
it takes years of litigation.

25:47.780 --> 25:50.080
Meanwhile, she's living in
terrible conditions

25:50.082 --> 25:51.715
and being abused
by her handlers.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.317
Yeah, but what
about law school?

25:53.319 --> 25:54.685
Everything you've
been working for?

25:54.687 --> 25:56.287
You could go to jail
for this, Izzy.

25:56.289 --> 25:59.290
I know that, but look at
what these people did to her.

26:00.927 --> 26:03.561
And that's just
the visible abuse.

26:03.563 --> 26:06.297
Imagine all of
the emotional scars she has.

26:08.234 --> 26:11.101
Look, remember
when we were kids

26:11.103 --> 26:13.571
and Mom and Dad got us tickets
to go to the circus,

26:13.573 --> 26:14.572
but we never went?

26:14.574 --> 26:16.941
Of course. We were crushed.

26:16.943 --> 26:19.276
There was
no tsunami warning that day.

26:19.278 --> 26:21.345
The real reason
we didn't go was because,

26:21.347 --> 26:23.981
after years of abuse,
Tyke the elephant

26:23.983 --> 26:26.817
<i> broke out of her cage</i>
<i> the day before the show.</i>

26:26.819 --> 26:28.085
(elephant trumpeting)

26:28.087 --> 26:29.954
<i> HPD had no choice. </i>
(officers shouting)

26:29.956 --> 26:31.121
(gunfire)

26:31.123 --> 26:32.590
<i> They shot and killed her.</i>

26:34.860 --> 26:38.128
They were trying to protect us
from the truth.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.130
Later on,
I found out what happened,

26:40.132 --> 26:42.266
and it always stuck with me.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.268
That's why I'm here.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.270
And that's why I need your help.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.038
What can I do?

26:48.040 --> 26:49.740
Mazie was supposed to be

26:49.742 --> 26:50.975
on a ship last night.

26:50.977 --> 26:52.776
I was able to
convince the captain

26:52.778 --> 26:54.778
to give me until
midnight tonight.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.280
But if she's not
on the boat by then,

26:56.282 --> 26:57.615
they're gonna leave without her.

26:57.617 --> 26:59.283
Problem is

26:59.285 --> 27:00.851
I had to ditch
the transport truck

27:00.853 --> 27:03.220
because I knew that HPD
would be out looking for it.

27:03.222 --> 27:05.990
So you need a new truck.

27:05.992 --> 27:09.627
I know I'm asking for a lot.

27:09.629 --> 27:12.796
But I can't let her go back
to that life, Jerry.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.398
I just can't.

27:21.407 --> 27:24.008
It's a miracle
no one got hit.

27:24.010 --> 27:25.409
It's not a miracle.

27:25.411 --> 27:28.412
If he was here to kill police,
he would've.

27:28.414 --> 27:31.115
This is where he entered,
took the hostage.

27:40.393 --> 27:42.793
He was looking
for something.

27:42.795 --> 27:45.996
And he made sure we wouldn't
be able to see what it was.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.582
GROVER: Yeah, well,
whatever it was,

27:48.583 --> 27:51.167
he was willing to take on
a whole army of cops to get it.

28:09.455 --> 28:11.422
Let me just get this straight
so I'm clear.

28:11.424 --> 28:13.457
You tell SWAT to stand down,

28:13.459 --> 28:16.060
but you think that us,
with a couple of pistols

28:16.062 --> 28:18.328
and a righteous disposition,
we're gonna take this guy down?

28:18.330 --> 28:19.463
Yeah, that's right.

28:19.465 --> 28:20.764
That's right?

28:20.766 --> 28:23.000
What are you,
what are you, nuts?

28:23.002 --> 28:25.069
This-this man that we are
chasing is wearing

28:25.071 --> 28:26.737
an indestructible suit

28:26.738 --> 28:28.404
that not even your
big, dumb head could penetrate.

28:28.407 --> 28:30.357
Right.

28:30.358 --> 28:32.308
You got a plan? You want
to tell me what your plan is?

28:32.311 --> 28:33.777
Sure. Soon as I figure it out,

28:33.778 --> 28:35.244
you'll be the first to know.
How about that?

28:41.220 --> 28:43.754
Faster.
Stay close to the shoulder.

28:53.165 --> 28:55.299
(tires screeching)

29:01.440 --> 29:03.507
Somebody jumped
out of the car.

29:03.509 --> 29:05.175
(engine revving)

29:07.747 --> 29:09.446
(tires screech)

29:09.448 --> 29:11.515
STEVE:
Where is he?

29:11.517 --> 29:12.950
He went that way.

29:22.361 --> 29:24.928
STEVE:
He could be anywhere.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.997
I'll call HPD.

29:28.467 --> 29:31.034
KONO:<i> Just confirmed.</i>
<i>We're deploying more air units.</i>

29:31.036 --> 29:32.336
(over laptop):
How's Officer Atowa?

29:32.338 --> 29:34.772
He's okay.
He's lucky to be alive.

29:34.774 --> 29:36.974
You have any idea
what our suspect was after?

29:36.976 --> 29:39.409
No, he was taken after
the evidence room break-in,

29:39.411 --> 29:40.844
so he has no idea.

29:40.846 --> 29:42.246
What about you?

29:42.248 --> 29:44.014
I ran the plate on the SUV

29:44.016 --> 29:45.438
that the suspect was driving.

29:45.439 --> 29:46.861
It was reported stolen
this morning.

29:46.862 --> 29:48.284
So I just got off
the phone with Duke.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.987
After a thorough
inventory check,

29:49.989 --> 29:52.790
HPD discovered
what our suspect was after:

29:52.792 --> 29:54.458
a Beretta M9.

29:54.459 --> 29:56.125
It's a key piece of
evidence in the murder case

29:56.128 --> 29:58.095
against Luke Waiola;
he's on trial right now.

29:58.097 --> 30:00.998
HPD's been trying to put
that guy away for a long time.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.433
Right, and that Beretta is
the first piece of hard evidence

30:03.435 --> 30:04.935
ever linking him to a crime.

30:04.937 --> 30:06.103
Chin, when was that Beretta

30:06.105 --> 30:08.105
supposed to be
presented in court?

Tomorrow.

30:09.909 --> 30:12.376
Without that gun, Waiola walks.

30:20.252 --> 30:22.920
Well, I can assure you
my client had nothing to do

30:22.922 --> 30:25.422
with the theft of the prototype
suit or that Beretta.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.057
Okay, uh,
that's-that's fine.

30:27.059 --> 30:28.559
We think, uh, maybe
he wasn't behind it,

30:28.561 --> 30:31.295
but he had something to do
with it and knows who it was.

30:31.297 --> 30:33.330
As a matter of fact,
we're pretty sure your client

30:33.332 --> 30:35.833
was the first person contacted
after that gun was stolen.

30:35.835 --> 30:37.434
You have any evidence
to support these claims?

30:37.436 --> 30:39.169
Yeah, we do. We do.

30:39.170 --> 30:40.903
We have a wire
in the amount of $10 million.

30:40.906 --> 30:44.074
The money was transferred
an hour after the gun was stolen

30:44.076 --> 30:45.943
from one of Wailoa's
offshore accounts

30:45.945 --> 30:50.080
to one of his shell corporations
that you, of all people,

30:50.082 --> 30:52.016
have access to.

30:52.017 --> 30:53.951
So, uh, I'm thinking either
he was trying to get you

30:53.953 --> 30:55.419
to give out early
Christmas bonuses,

30:55.421 --> 30:57.487
or, um, he was
actually interested

30:57.489 --> 30:59.223
in purchasing
that Beretta.

30:59.225 --> 31:00.591
Right. Whoever did this
gave your client

31:00.593 --> 31:02.492
the opportunity to buy
a mistrial, okay?

31:02.494 --> 31:04.494
There's no gun, there's no case.

31:26.518 --> 31:28.552
he could make
that gun disappear.

31:28.554 --> 31:31.655
