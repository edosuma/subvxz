01:08.388 --> 01:12.189
I'M GOING CRAZY
DOWN HERE.

01:12.190 --> 01:14.157
BUT SINCE WE BROUGHT
THE TECHNO-DROME

01:14.158 --> 01:17.059
BACK FROM DIMENSION X,
WE'VE BEEN STUCK HERE.

01:17.060 --> 01:19.725
AND ALL OUR SCHEMES
TO RETURN

01:19.726 --> 01:21.660
TO THE SURFACE
OF THE PLANET

01:21.661 --> 01:23.395
HAVE FAILED.

01:23.396 --> 01:24.829
BECAUSE
OF THOSE ACCURSED

01:24.830 --> 01:26.863
TEENAGE MUTANT
NINJA TURTLES.

01:26.864 --> 01:29.064
I AM CONSTANTLY DEFEATED

01:29.065 --> 01:31.132
BY THEIR PROWESS
AT THE MARTIAL ARTS.

01:31.133 --> 01:32.266
BUT NO MORE.

01:32.267 --> 01:35.234
I'LL SHALL TURN 2
OF MY OWN MINIONS

01:35.235 --> 01:37.636
INTO UNBEATABLE
SUPER NINJAS.

01:37.637 --> 01:38.635
WHAT?

01:38.636 --> 01:39.936
WHO?

01:39.937 --> 01:41.870
BEBOP! ROCK STEADY!

01:41.871 --> 01:43.172
COME UP HERE AT ONCE.

01:43.173 --> 01:45.406
NOT THOSE TWO.

01:45.407 --> 01:48.307
IT WOULD TAKE A MIRACLE.

01:48.308 --> 01:51.409
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I HAD IN MIND.

01:51.410 --> 01:54.143
WHAT'S UP, BOSS?

01:54.144 --> 01:55.978
GET IN THE TRANSPORT
MODULE.

01:55.979 --> 01:57.312
WE'RE
HEADING EARTHWARD

01:57.313 --> 01:59.914
TO
THE ASIAN/AMERICAN
CULTURAL CENTER.

01:59.915 --> 02:03.149
THERE'S SOMEONE
THERE I WANT YOU
TO MEET.

02:03.150 --> 02:05.383
COME BACK HERE!

02:05.384 --> 02:10.318
OH, I SHOULD NEVER HAVE
JOINED FORCES WITH A NINJA.

02:10.318 --> 02:13.420
NEXT TIME
I CONQUER A PLANET,

02:13.421 --> 02:16.355
I'M USING AN ACCOUNTANT.

02:17.990 --> 02:21.424
I'VE STUDIED WELL
THE WAYS OF OUR ANCIENT
FOOT CLAN.

02:21.425 --> 02:25.059
HA, THOSE TWO AREN'T
THE ONLY ONES WHO
CAN PRACTICE.

02:25.060 --> 02:26.560
HIT IT,
MICHELANGELO.

02:26.561 --> 02:29.395
WHOA! CHECK OUT
THESE MOVES.

02:32.031 --> 02:34.198
WITH OUR NINJA
FIGHTING SKILLS

02:34.199 --> 02:36.465
AND SUPERIOR
PIZZA-MAKING ABILITIES,

02:36.466 --> 02:38.565
IT'S NO WONDER
SHREDDER STAYS

02:38.566 --> 02:40.301
HOLD UP IN THE CENTER
OF THE EARTH.

02:41.969 --> 02:46.070
APRIL O'NEILL HERE
AT THE ASIAN/AMERICAN
CULTURAL CENTER,

02:46.071 --> 02:48.338
WHERE, AMONG OTHER
ANCIENT ARTIFACTS,

02:48.339 --> 02:50.638
A BURIAL URN
IS ON DISPLAY.

02:50.639 --> 02:52.573
IT'S REPORTED
TO CONTAIN THE ASHES

02:52.574 --> 02:55.975
OF A NOBLE WARRIOR
WHO LIVED HUNDREDS
OF YEARS AGO.

02:55.976 --> 02:58.842
HIS NAME
WAS SHIBANO SAMA.

02:58.843 --> 03:01.845
SHIBANO SAMA.
WE MUST GET THERE

03:01.846 --> 03:03.245
BEFORE SHREDDER DOES.

03:03.246 --> 03:04.246
SHREDDER?

03:04.247 --> 03:05.713
I'LL EXPLAIN
ON THE WAY.

03:07.114 --> 03:08.281
WHEN
SHREDDER STOLE

03:08.282 --> 03:10.415
THE LEADERSHIP
OF THE FOOT CLAN
FROM ME,

03:10.416 --> 03:13.650
HE ALSO STOLE
THE CLAN'S
SACRED SCROLLS.

03:13.651 --> 03:16.519
NOW I FEAR HE PLANS
TO USE THOSE SCROLLS

03:16.520 --> 03:19.953
TO GAIN POWERS
NO MORTAL WAS
MEANT TO HAVE.

03:19.954 --> 03:23.755
WHAT HAS THIS TO DO
WITH THE REMAINS
OF SHIBANO SAMA?

03:23.756 --> 03:26.390
HE WAS THE FOUNDER
OF THE FOOT CLAN.

03:30.593 --> 03:33.093
HEAVY DUTY HAPPENING.

03:33.094 --> 03:35.661
YEAH, JUST LIKE
A KUNG FU MOVIE.

03:35.662 --> 03:39.163
OUR ONLY HOPE IS
TO BEAT SHREDDER
TO THE REMAINS.

03:39.164 --> 03:41.932
AND YOU HAVE FAILED
AS USUAL.

03:41.933 --> 03:43.265
SHREDDER.

03:43.266 --> 03:44.933
A LITTLE
NINJA POTION

03:44.934 --> 03:46.467
OF MY OWN
DEVISING.

03:46.468 --> 03:48.735
KNOCK-OUT...GAS.

03:50.370 --> 03:52.203
HURRY, YOU TWO.
THE EFFECTS
OF THE GAS

03:52.204 --> 03:53.904
WILL ONLY LAST
A FEW MOMENTS.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.344
AS LEADER
OF THE FOOT CLAN,

04:06.345 --> 04:09.678
I CALL FORTH
THE SPIRIT
OF ITS CREATOR,

04:09.679 --> 04:12.247
SHIBANO SAMA.

04:12.248 --> 04:15.482
SHIBANO SAMA,
COME FORTH.

04:15.483 --> 04:16.916
I BESEECH YOU.

04:20.918 --> 04:23.919
WHY HAVE YOU
SUMMONED ME?

04:23.920 --> 04:27.588
THAT YOU MAY TEACH
MY TWO MINIONS

04:27.589 --> 04:28.755
THE WAYS OF THE FOOT.

04:28.756 --> 04:32.190
AND MAKE THEM INVINCIBLE
SUPER NINJAS.

04:32.191 --> 04:35.626
OH, BOY.
ON-THE-JOB TRAINING.

04:35.627 --> 04:38.827
ONLY THE TRUE LEADER
OF THE FOOT CLAN

04:38.828 --> 04:41.195
MAY MAKE
SUCH A REQUEST.

04:41.196 --> 04:43.895
I AM THE TRUE LEADER.

04:43.896 --> 04:45.997
I HAVE THE SACRED SCROLLS.

04:45.998 --> 04:47.765
NO WAY, HOSEBAG.

04:47.766 --> 04:49.932
MASTER SPLINTER IS
THE LEADER.

04:49.933 --> 04:51.166
TELL HIM, MASTER.

04:52.567 --> 04:54.434
WHO AM I?

04:54.435 --> 04:55.836
WHO ARE YOU?

04:55.837 --> 04:59.771
ALL FALSE CLAIMANTS
TO THE CLAN THRONE

04:59.772 --> 05:02.338
MUST SUFFER
THE CONSEQUENCES.

05:02.339 --> 05:05.440
DUE TO TECHNICAL PROBLEMS
WITH MASTER SPLINTER,

05:05.441 --> 05:07.775
WE'RE IN DEEP TROUBLE.

05:07.776 --> 05:09.643
THE GAS GAVE
HIM AMNESIA.

05:09.644 --> 05:12.343
I'LL HOLD THEM OFF
WHILE YOU GET HIM
BACK TO THE LAIR

05:12.344 --> 05:13.611
AND WORK ON
AN ANTIDOTE.

05:13.612 --> 05:16.211
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO KNOWS
ALL ABOUT POTIONS

05:16.212 --> 05:18.479
AN--AND ANTIDOTES
AND STUFF.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.248
I'LL STAY HERE
AND HOLD THEM OFF.

05:20.249 --> 05:23.016
BOY, AM I A GLUTTON
FOR PUNISHMENT OR WHAT?

05:26.351 --> 05:29.152
ARE YOU SURE THAT POTION
WILL RESTORE HIS MEMORY?

05:29.153 --> 05:31.153
YES, BUT IT WILL
TAKE TIME.

05:31.154 --> 05:34.088
CAN YOU, LIKE, REMEMBER
ANYTHING, MASTER?

05:34.089 --> 05:38.090
MY MIND
IS A COMPLETE BLANK.

05:38.091 --> 05:40.757
WE'VE GOT TO JOG
HIS MEMORY.

05:40.758 --> 05:43.826
YOUR NAME IS SPLINTER,

05:43.827 --> 05:46.660
BUT YOUR REAL NAME
IS HAMATO YOSHI.

05:46.661 --> 05:48.529
YOU LIVED IN JAPAN,

05:48.530 --> 05:50.229
AND YOU WEREN'T A RAT.

05:50.230 --> 05:53.031
THERE WAS A NINJA CLAN
KNOWN AS THE FOOT.

05:53.032 --> 05:54.764
YOU WERE THEIR SHIDOSHI,

05:54.765 --> 05:57.366
TEACHER OF THE WARRIOR
WAYS OF ENLIGHTENMENT.

05:57.367 --> 05:59.000
YOU WERE A QUIET MAN

05:59.001 --> 06:01.035
WHO LOVED RENAISSANCE ART.

06:01.036 --> 06:03.402
BUT ONE STUDENT
PLOTTED TO OVERTHROW

06:03.403 --> 06:05.236
YOUR LEADERSHIP
OF THE FOOT CLAN,

06:05.237 --> 06:07.104
OROKU SAKI.

06:07.105 --> 06:08.439
THEN ONE DAY,

06:08.440 --> 06:10.873
<i>A SENSEI,
A MASTER TEACHER,</i>

06:10.874 --> 06:12.407
VISITED THE FOOT SCHOOL.

06:12.408 --> 06:14.742
AND OROKU SAKI
MADE HIS MOVE.

06:20.246 --> 06:22.146
IMPUDENT DOG.

06:22.147 --> 06:24.881
BOW BEFORE
OUR BELOVED MASTER.

06:26.482 --> 06:31.851
<i>SO YOU PLOT TO KILL
OUR HONORABLE SENSEI.</i>

06:31.852 --> 06:34.919
IN DISGRACE,
YOU FLED TO AMERICA.

06:34.920 --> 06:38.454
PENNILESS, YOU WERE FORCED
TO LIVE IN THE SEWERS.

06:38.455 --> 06:40.856
YOUR ONLY FRIENDS
WERE THE RATS.

06:40.857 --> 06:43.389
AND THEN ONE DAY,
A YOUNG BOY DROPPED

06:43.390 --> 06:45.290
HIS PET TURTLES
DOWN THE DRAIN.

06:45.291 --> 06:47.059
MEANWHILE BACK IN JAPAN,

06:47.060 --> 06:49.792
UNDER OROKU SAKI'S
EVIL LEADERSHIP,

06:49.793 --> 06:53.195
THE FOOT CLAN TURNED
INTO AN ARMY OF CRIME.

06:53.196 --> 06:54.696
BACK IN NEW YORK,

06:54.697 --> 06:57.197
YOU LIVED HAPPILY
WITH YOUR TURTLES
AND RATS.

06:57.198 --> 06:58.865
BUT THEN ONE DAY,

06:58.866 --> 07:01.233
SOMETHING ELSE
CAME DOWN THE DRAIN,

07:01.234 --> 07:03.700
IT WAS A POWERFUL MUTAGEN,

07:03.701 --> 07:06.001
IT CAUSED WHOEVER TOUCHED IT

07:06.002 --> 07:08.503
TO TAKE ON THE FORM
OF WHATEVER ANIMAL

07:08.504 --> 07:11.238
IT HAD MOST RECENTLY
BEEN IN CONTACT WITH.

07:11.239 --> 07:13.539
WE TURTLES STARTED
BECOMING HUMAN,

07:13.540 --> 07:15.839
BECAUSE WE'D MOST
RECENTLY BEEN WITH YOU.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.840
BUT YOU'D MOST RECENTLY
BEEN IN CONTACT

07:17.841 --> 07:19.342
WITH THE RATS.

07:19.343 --> 07:21.641
YOU NAMED
YOURSELF SPLINTER,

07:21.642 --> 07:23.244
FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.

07:23.245 --> 07:24.443
AND YOU NAMED US

07:24.444 --> 07:26.779
AFTER YOUR FAVORITE
RENAISSANCE PAINTERS

07:26.780 --> 07:29.880
AND TRAINED US IN
THE ART OF NINJITSU.

07:29.881 --> 07:31.715
I BECAME LEONARDO.

07:31.716 --> 07:33.682
AND THERE'S DONATELLO,

07:33.683 --> 07:37.150
WHOSE SIMPLE WOODEN BO
CAN DISARM ANY ADVERSARY.

07:37.151 --> 07:38.518
AND MICHELANGELO,

07:38.519 --> 07:41.319
<i>WHO IS MASTER OF
THE WHIRLING NUNCHAKUS.</i>

07:41.320 --> 07:42.353
AND RAPHAEL,

07:42.354 --> 07:45.021
WHO'S REALLY THRASHED
RIGHT NOW.

07:45.022 --> 07:47.122
THAT RIGHT. WE'VE GOT
TO SNAP THIS THING UP.

07:47.123 --> 07:49.857
<i>DOES ANY OF THIS
SOUND FAMILIAR, SENSEI?</i>

07:49.858 --> 07:51.958
I DO NOT KNOW.

07:51.959 --> 07:54.792
I'M SO UNSURE
OF EVERYTHING.

07:54.793 --> 07:57.227
WHAT HAPPENED
TO OROKU SAKI?

07:57.228 --> 07:59.529
AND WHO POURED
THAT MUTAGEN
ON YOU?

07:59.530 --> 08:01.462
IT TIES TOGETHER.

08:01.463 --> 08:04.230
HERE, LET ME TRY.
SEE, IT STARTED

08:04.231 --> 08:06.398
WHEN WE MET A WOMAN
NAMED APRIL O'NEILL,

08:06.399 --> 08:09.100
APRIL WAS A REPORTER
COVERING A SERIES

08:09.101 --> 08:11.768
OF MYSTERIOUS THEFTS
AT SCIENTIFIC COMPANIES

08:11.769 --> 08:14.936
BY A GUY WHO CALLED
HIMSELF SHREDDER,

08:14.937 --> 08:18.005
AND SHREDDER DIDN'T
LIKE THAT ONE BIT.

08:18.006 --> 08:21.173
SIGN-OFF TIME,
APRIL O'NEILL.

08:22.641 --> 08:24.641
CHILL OUT, HOMEBOY.

08:25.809 --> 08:27.676
HEY, WATCH IT
WITH THAT THING,
PAL.

08:27.677 --> 08:30.110
OH, WHOEVER YOU ARE,
YOU ARE DEAD.

08:51.421 --> 08:53.588
WHOA! WEIRD-LOOKING
DUDES.

08:53.589 --> 08:55.023
YEAH, AND THEY DRESS
FUNNY, TOO.

08:55.024 --> 08:56.524
I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU ARE,

08:56.525 --> 08:57.858
BUT THANKS.

08:57.859 --> 09:01.360
YOU'RE...NOT HUMAN!

09:01.361 --> 09:04.328
BINGO! NOW WE'RE DEALING
WITH A REAL MIND HERE.

09:04.329 --> 09:06.429
YOU'RE--YOU'RE TURTLES.

09:06.430 --> 09:08.196
YEP. SO WE ARE.

09:08.197 --> 09:10.698
I CAN'T HANDLE THIS.

09:14.701 --> 09:17.234
LEONARDO, ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS REALLY THE TIME

09:17.235 --> 09:19.035
FOR US TO BE TELLING
OUR LIFE STORY?

09:19.036 --> 09:22.204
WE'VE GOT TO HELP
MASTER SPLINTER GET
HIS MEMORY BACK.

09:22.205 --> 09:24.038
WELL, YEAH, BUT
WHAT ABOUT RAPHAEL?

09:24.039 --> 09:27.339
THOSE GOONS ARE
PROBABLY TURNING HIM
INTO SUSHI RIGHT NOW.

09:29.541 --> 09:32.875
YOUR MINIONS
HAVE GREAT STRENGTH.

09:32.876 --> 09:36.544
THEY'LL MAKE
THE ULTIMATE
NINJA WARRIORS.

09:36.545 --> 09:38.178
AND FOR PRACTICE,

09:38.179 --> 09:40.646
THEY WILL NEED
A TARGET.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.514
HOW COME I GET
THE FEELING

09:43.515 --> 09:45.448
IT'S GOING TO BE ME?

09:59.623 --> 10:02.323
HEY! WHO TURNED
OUT THE LIGHTS?

10:03.959 --> 10:07.360
HA, YOU COULDN'T TEACH
THOSE BONEHEADS ANYTHING

10:07.361 --> 10:08.760
IN A MILLION YEARS.

10:08.761 --> 10:13.096
AH, BUT I AM NO
ORDINARY TEACHER.

10:13.097 --> 10:16.464
IN THE NAME
OF THE EMPEROR KONEJI,

10:16.465 --> 10:18.165
SON OF HEAVEN,

10:18.166 --> 10:20.499
I GIVE YOU THE POWERS

10:20.500 --> 10:22.834
OF THE MASTER NINJAS.

10:25.170 --> 10:30.171
<i>WE LIVE ONLY
TO SERVE OUR SENSEI.</i>

10:34.541 --> 10:36.674
WHAT'S KEEPING THE GUYS?

10:36.675 --> 10:38.641
WHY SHOULD I
HAVE ALL THE FUN?

10:40.177 --> 10:42.910
OH, CAN YOU REMEMBER
ANYTHING, MASTER?

10:42.911 --> 10:45.812
PERHAPS IF YOU
TOLD ME MORE.

10:45.813 --> 10:48.447
WHO EXPOSED US
TO THAT MUTAGEN?

10:48.448 --> 10:51.215
IT WAS
SHREDDER HIMSELF.

10:51.216 --> 10:54.483
SEE, HE WAS ROLLING
AROUND UNDER THE CITY

10:54.484 --> 10:57.451
IN THIS HUGE FORTRESS
CALLED THE TECHNO-DROME.

10:57.452 --> 10:58.885
IN ADDITION TO HIS ROBOTS,

10:58.886 --> 11:01.220
HE ALSO EMPLOYED
A BUNCH OF PUNKS,

11:01.221 --> 11:04.988
INCLUDING A PAIR NAMED,
BEBOP AND ROCK STEADY.

11:04.989 --> 11:06.589
JUST SIT.

11:10.626 --> 11:13.560
I WISH I'D BROUGHT
SOME COMICS.

11:24.299 --> 11:27.433
WHAT YOU DOING
TO US, MAN?

11:27.434 --> 11:29.301
JUST RELAX.

11:32.803 --> 11:36.604
UH, WHAT DO YOU NEED
THEM ANIMALS FOR?

11:36.605 --> 11:39.005
AND HE TURNED THEM
INTO MUTANTS,

11:39.006 --> 11:40.872
JUST LIKE HE DID TO US.

11:40.873 --> 11:43.107
IS ANY OF THIS
HELPING, MASTER?

11:43.108 --> 11:45.242
A LITTLE.

11:45.243 --> 11:47.776
I SEEM TO REMEMBER,

11:47.777 --> 11:51.378
DIDN'T OROKU SAKI
HAVE SOME CONNECTION

11:51.379 --> 11:53.279
WITH SHREDDER?

11:53.280 --> 11:55.547
EXACTOMUNDO!

11:55.548 --> 11:57.649
HE WAS SHREDDER.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.415
BUT WE DIDN'T
FIND THAT OUT

11:59.416 --> 12:01.283
UNTIL HE CAPTURED YOU.

12:03.719 --> 12:06.419
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY, JUST
COME ALONG PEACEFULLY.

12:08.288 --> 12:11.088
DON'T MAKE THIS ANY
TOUGHER ON YOURSELF.

12:13.224 --> 12:15.824
NATURALLY, WE CAME
TO YOUR RESCUE.

12:16.926 --> 12:19.159
MASTER SPLINTER'S
WALKING STICK!

12:19.160 --> 12:20.794
HE'S NEVER WITHOUT IT.

12:20.795 --> 12:22.261
HE MUST BE IN TROUBLE!

12:22.262 --> 12:25.762
INDEED, HE IS.
HA HA HA.

12:25.763 --> 12:27.497
IF YOU WANT
TO SEE HIM AGAIN,

12:27.498 --> 12:29.031
YOU'LL HAVE TO
COME IN.

12:29.032 --> 12:30.732
IT'S GOT TO BE
A TRAP!

12:30.733 --> 12:32.667
I HATE IT
WHEN HE SAYS THAT.

12:36.436 --> 12:38.035
SPLINTER!

12:38.036 --> 12:39.869
I'LL CUT YOU
DOWN, MASTER.

12:39.870 --> 12:42.037
I MUST
CONGRATULATE YOU.

12:42.038 --> 12:45.206
IT'S THE GUYS
WE FOUGHT LAST NIGHT.

12:45.207 --> 12:48.874
YOU PASSED YOUR TEST
WITH FLYING COLORS.

12:48.875 --> 12:50.942
TEST? WHAT TEST?

12:50.943 --> 12:53.677
YOUR HAIRY LITTLE
FRIEND KNOWS ME AS

12:53.678 --> 12:56.311
OROKU SAKI.

12:56.312 --> 12:58.780
BUT YOU MAY CALL ME...

12:58.781 --> 13:00.614
THE SHREDDER.

13:00.615 --> 13:02.114
A KITCHEN UTENSIL?

13:02.115 --> 13:04.048
YOU WOULD BE WISE
TO LOSE

13:04.049 --> 13:06.383
YOUR FLIPPANT WAYS
IF YOU WISH TO JOIN

13:06.384 --> 13:07.784
THE HONORABLE FOOT CLAN.

13:07.785 --> 13:10.218
WHY SHOULD WE WANT
TO DO THAT?

13:10.219 --> 13:12.085
BECAUSE IT WAS I

13:12.086 --> 13:14.254
WHO MADE YOU
WHAT YOU ARE TODAY.

13:14.255 --> 13:17.389
DON'T DENY YOUR DESTINY.

13:17.390 --> 13:18.489
JOIN ME.

13:19.724 --> 13:20.724
DOES THE PHRASE,

13:20.725 --> 13:21.790
"GO SUCK A LEMON"

13:21.791 --> 13:23.325
HOLD ANY MEANING
FOR YOU?

13:23.326 --> 13:25.059
LET'S CUT HIM DOWN!

13:25.060 --> 13:26.460
VERY WELL.

13:26.461 --> 13:28.728
I HAVE MY OWN MUTANTS.

13:28.729 --> 13:30.195
BEBOP!

13:30.196 --> 13:32.029
ROCK STEADY!

13:32.030 --> 13:33.830
DESTROY THEM!

13:33.831 --> 13:38.065
OH, WITH GREAT PLEASURE,
MASTER SHREDDER.

13:41.235 --> 13:42.468
JUMP FOR IT!

13:43.904 --> 13:46.236
YOU IDIOTS!

13:46.237 --> 13:48.504
THE MUTATION DIDN'T
UP THEIR IQs ANY.

14:09.549 --> 14:10.548
COME ON, SPLINTER.

14:10.549 --> 14:12.416
WE'RE CHECKING OUT
OF THIS DUMP.

14:12.417 --> 14:14.484
COME ON, YOU FOOLS!

14:17.253 --> 14:20.321
I JUST HOPE I HAVEN'T
MISSED OUT ON THE ACTION!

14:30.526 --> 14:32.260
REST HERE
A MOMENT, MASTER.

14:32.261 --> 14:34.462
YOU KNOW, THAT WAS
ALMOST TOO EASY.

14:34.463 --> 14:36.996
I REALLY WISH
YOU'D STOP SAYING
THINGS LIKE THAT.

14:36.997 --> 14:39.297
BEBOP AND ROCK STEADY
WERE READY TO MAKE

14:39.298 --> 14:40.630
MINCE MEAT OUT OF US.

14:44.434 --> 14:46.934
SAY YOUR PRAYERS,
TURTLES.

14:52.438 --> 14:55.605
SO BEBOP AND ROCK STEADY
CAME AFTER YOU.

14:57.006 --> 14:58.939
AND WERE THEY MAD.

15:04.144 --> 15:06.144
LOOKIE WHAT WE FOUND.

15:07.212 --> 15:08.779
WE'VE GOT A SCORE
TO SETTLE

15:08.780 --> 15:10.947
WITH YOU LITTLE TWERPS.

15:16.317 --> 15:18.783
AW, DID I HURT YOUSE?

15:18.784 --> 15:20.418
THIS'LL MAKE IT BETTER.

15:23.720 --> 15:26.654
WE DON'T LIKE RATS
IN OUR FAIR CITY.

15:27.822 --> 15:31.489
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST
WRING YOUR STINKIN' NECK.

15:31.490 --> 15:33.857
NOT SO FAST, HOMEBOY.

15:38.461 --> 15:42.028
DRINK BLAZIN'
ELECTRIC DEATH,
TURTLES!

15:42.029 --> 15:44.096
AH, THE BOY
LIKES HIS WORK.

15:59.938 --> 16:02.171
'SCUSE ME, BUT IS
ANY OF THIS STUFF

16:02.172 --> 16:04.006
JOGGING YOUR MEMORY,
MASTER?

16:04.007 --> 16:06.440
AHH, I'M NOT SURE.

16:06.441 --> 16:08.475
I'M SO CONFUSED.

16:08.476 --> 16:11.210
LEONARDO, EVEN IF WE DO
GET HIS MEMORY BACK,

16:11.211 --> 16:12.978
HOW CAN
HE STOP SHREDDER?

16:12.979 --> 16:16.513
IF SPLINTER CAN PROVE
HE IS THE TRUE LEADER
OF THE FOOT CLAN,

16:16.514 --> 16:19.914
SHIBANO SAMA WILL TURN
AGAINST SHREDDER.

16:19.915 --> 16:21.915
YEAH, BUT HOW?

16:21.916 --> 16:24.150
THE KUR LI MANEUVER.

16:24.151 --> 16:26.751
OH, I'VE HEARD SPLINTER
TALK ABOUT IT,

16:26.752 --> 16:28.752
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN
HIM USE IT.

16:28.753 --> 16:33.155
IT'S A FIGHTING MOVE
KNOWN ONLY BY THE TRUE
LEADER OF THE FOOT CLAN.

16:33.156 --> 16:35.389
IF SPLINTER'S MEMORY
COMES BACK,

16:35.390 --> 16:37.557
HE CAN DO
THE KUR LI MANEUVER

16:37.558 --> 16:38.924
FOR SHIBANO SAMA.

16:38.925 --> 16:40.925
AND PROVE THAT
SHREDDER'S LYING.

16:40.926 --> 16:45.761
STRANGE THAT
OROKU SAKI NOW HAD
ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY.

16:45.762 --> 16:47.395
I SEEM TO RECALL...

16:47.396 --> 16:48.929
HE WAS NOT ALONE.

16:48.930 --> 16:50.629
NO, DUH!

16:50.630 --> 16:52.397
THERE WAS
THIS ALIEN DUDE

16:52.398 --> 16:54.932
FROM DIMENSION X
NAMED KRANG.

16:54.933 --> 16:57.267
WELL, HE WAS THIS
WAR CRIMINAL

16:57.268 --> 17:00.435
WHO'D BEEN BANISHED
TO EARTH AND HAD
HIS BODY TAKE AWAY.

17:00.436 --> 17:04.270
SO HE WAS USING SHREDDER
TO BUILT HIM A NEW BOD.

17:04.271 --> 17:05.371
EXCELLENT.

17:05.372 --> 17:07.304
I WANT YOU
TO ADD TO IT

17:07.305 --> 17:10.373
THIS MOLECULAR
AMPLIFICATION UNIT.

17:10.374 --> 17:11.707
BUT WHY?

17:11.708 --> 17:14.075
SAKI, YOU FOOL,

17:14.076 --> 17:15.876
DON'T WASTE TIME.

17:15.877 --> 17:18.510
YOUR FORCES
ARE DEPLETED.

17:18.511 --> 17:20.978
THE TURTLES ARE
ON THEIR WAY.

17:20.979 --> 17:23.446
INSTALL THE CHIP NOW!

17:27.616 --> 17:29.183
ALL RIGHT. I'LL DO IT.

17:40.223 --> 17:42.889
YOU MAY FEEL
SOME DISORIENTATION

17:42.890 --> 17:44.691
WHEN YOU REVIVE
IN YOUR NEW BODY.

18:00.733 --> 18:02.699
IT'S ALIVE!

18:05.701 --> 18:08.403
IT'S ALIVE!

18:08.404 --> 18:10.637
KRANG'S BODY
HAD A CIRCUIT

18:10.638 --> 18:13.839
THAT TURNED HIM
INTO THIS GIANT
ECONOMY SIZE.

18:16.141 --> 18:18.475
HOLY GUACAMOLE!

18:18.476 --> 18:22.443
NOTHING CAN STOP
THE ALMIGHTY KRANG.

18:27.780 --> 18:31.047
WELL, NATURALLY WE THOUGHT
IT'D BE A MONDO NOTION

18:31.048 --> 18:34.182
TO BRING ALL OF THIS
TO A SCREECHING HALT.

18:35.751 --> 18:38.284
OH, WHERE'S GODZILLA
WHEN YOU REALLY NEED IT?

18:38.285 --> 18:41.320
WELL, GUYS,
IT'S BEEN GREAT
KNOWING YOU.

18:43.921 --> 18:45.155
WHAT THE HECK?

18:45.156 --> 18:46.555
COME ON, GUYS!

18:48.957 --> 18:51.291
WELCOME ABOARD
THE TURTLE BLIMP.

18:51.292 --> 18:53.625
DOES THIS THING
ACTUALLY WORK?

18:53.626 --> 18:55.494
JUST WATCH.

18:55.495 --> 18:58.361
COWABUNGA!

18:58.362 --> 19:00.295
WE'VE GOT TO SHRINK
HIM DOWN!

19:10.067 --> 19:13.502
I AM KRANG,
THE ALL-POWERFUL!

19:13.503 --> 19:16.537
I HAVE NEVER
BEEN DEFEATED!

19:16.538 --> 19:19.972
WELL, YOU NEVER TANGLED
WITH A TURTLE BEFORE, PAL.

19:19.973 --> 19:22.139
LET'S KICK SOME SHELL.

19:24.975 --> 19:27.376
SHREDDER, COME QUICKLY.

19:28.510 --> 19:31.912
IT'S THAT
RETRO-MUTO
THINGAMABOB.

19:31.913 --> 19:36.046
HE'S GONNA USE IT
TO TURN US BACK
INTO ORDINARY TURTLES.

19:36.047 --> 19:39.916
WELL, GANG, LOOKS LIKE
IT'S BACK TO THE OLD
PET SHOP FOR US.

19:39.917 --> 19:41.516
FAR FROM IT.

19:41.517 --> 19:44.718
TONIGHT I DINE
ON TURTLE SOUP.

19:48.154 --> 19:50.921
NO!

19:50.922 --> 19:52.522
MASTER SPLINTER!

19:52.523 --> 19:54.956
CLIMB ON MY BACK.

20:00.027 --> 20:01.894
OF COURSE!

20:01.895 --> 20:04.461
I REMEMBER IT ALL.

20:04.462 --> 20:06.162
WHERE IS RAPHAEL?

20:07.297 --> 20:09.464
HE'S TRAPPED
IN THE CULTURAL CENTER.

20:09.465 --> 20:11.865
WE HAVEN'T
A MOMENT TO LOSE.

20:13.066 --> 20:14.733
EXCELLENT.

20:14.734 --> 20:17.434
YOU HAVE MASTERED
EVERY FIGHTING MANEUVER

20:17.435 --> 20:19.536
KNOWN TO THE FOOT CLAN.

20:19.537 --> 20:22.237
ALL BUT ONE, I BELIEVE.

20:22.238 --> 20:24.904
DOES ANY OF THESE
IMPOSTORS KNOW...

20:24.905 --> 20:27.239
THE KUR LI MANEUVER?

20:27.240 --> 20:30.640
AH, WELL,
ONLY THE TRUE LEADER

20:30.641 --> 20:32.609
OF THE FOOT CLAN
MAY KNOW IT.

20:32.610 --> 20:34.009
DO YOU?

20:37.678 --> 20:39.845
THE KUR LI
MANEUVER!

20:39.846 --> 20:43.247
AH, I CAN'T MOVE.

20:51.252 --> 20:54.219
YOU IMPOSTORS!

20:55.854 --> 20:58.589
MAMA!

21:09.695 --> 21:11.328
THEY GOT AWAY.

21:11.329 --> 21:13.195
HEY, DON'T WORRY.
THEY ALWAYS DO THAT.

21:13.196 --> 21:16.197
AND SURELY, IT'S TIME
YOU RETURNED

21:16.198 --> 21:18.131

21:18.132 --> 21:19.499
SHIBANO SAMA.

21:19.500 --> 21:21.833
PERHAPS YOU'RE CORRECT.

21:21.834 --> 21:25.102

A WISE TEACHER,
HAMATO YOSHI.

21:25.103 --> 21:28.137
