00:02.330 --> 00:04.297
Tonight on a very special

00:04.297 --> 00:05.863
Kitchen Nightmares,
Chef Ramsay

00:05.863 --> 00:08.830
is in Eagle Rock, California,
where twins Jim and Jeff

00:08.830 --> 00:11.463
are fighting to keep
their restaurant alive.

00:13.497 --> 00:15.397
Right from the very beginning,

00:15.397 --> 00:18.063
Gordon finds out he has
double trouble on his hands.

00:18.063 --> 00:20.463
Oh, my God.

00:20.463 --> 00:22.863
They're messy...
Make sure
they say a prayer

00:22.863 --> 00:25.097
before they start
eating that.
they're lazy...

00:25.097 --> 00:27.397
When's the last time this place
was cleaned? What a mess.

00:27.397 --> 00:29.963
I hate cleaning. To me,
that's a 4-letter word.

00:29.963 --> 00:30.000
They're loud...
You sure you don't
like raw chicken?

00:30.000 --> 00:32.897
They're loud...
You sure you don't
like raw chicken?

00:32.897 --> 00:34.797
And they're emotional.
I didn't think it was that bad.

00:34.797 --> 00:38.230
And this all adds up
to a recipe for disaster.

00:38.230 --> 00:40.630
Will you stop acting
like a baby?

00:40.630 --> 00:43.230
- Oh, blow it out your.
-  Excuse me?

00:43.230 --> 00:45.897
You heard it.
Hey, need
diaper changing?

00:45.897 --> 00:47.030
Shut up!

00:47.030 --> 00:48.597
Will Chef Ramsay

00:48.597 --> 00:50.530
be able to get through
to Jim and Jeff?

00:50.530 --> 00:53.030
Right now you're making
yourself look stupid.

00:53.030 --> 00:55.297
Or is this set of twins
the beyond saving?

00:55.297 --> 00:57.730
It's a mistake.
It's a lethal
mistake.

00:57.730 --> 01:00.000
- We can't serve them.
- You'll  kill somebody.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.063
- We can't serve them.
- You'll  kill somebody.

01:00.063 --> 01:01.630
I screwed up.

01:01.630 --> 01:03.597
What do you want me
to say now?

01:22.097 --> 01:23.730
Nestled in the middle of

01:23.730 --> 01:26.830
the up-and-coming neighborhood
of Eagle Rock, California,

01:26.830 --> 01:28.264
is Capri,

01:28.264 --> 01:30.000
an Italian restaurant which
is owned by the thiel twins.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.597
an Italian restaurant which
is owned by the thiel twins.

01:31.597 --> 01:33.331
Hi, I'm Jeff.
Hi--Jeff.

01:33.331 --> 01:36.197
I'm Jeff.
No, I'm Jeff.
You're Jim.

01:36.197 --> 01:37.797
I'm Jim.
And...

01:37.797 --> 01:40.497
We're the owners
of the Capri Italian restaurant.

01:40.497 --> 01:42.797
Good evening, Capri,
Jim speaking.

01:42.797 --> 01:44.697
How we got into
the restaurant business is

01:44.697 --> 01:46.631
We used to come here
all the time,

01:46.631 --> 01:49.397
and we loved the place,
so we said, "We'll buy it."

01:49.397 --> 01:51.497
the feeling was,
it's like, dude, free pizza?

01:51.497 --> 01:53.297
All right.
Yeah, yeah.

01:53.297 --> 01:55.831
Word, word,
uh-huh. Team Capri.

01:55.831 --> 01:59.897
The twins are like two
overgrown boys.

01:59.897 --> 02:00.000
Jeffy's getting larger.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.497
Jeffy's getting larger.

02:03.497 --> 02:05.597
Let's play cymbals.

02:05.597 --> 02:08.031
They're just kind of
immature.

02:08.031 --> 02:10.997
Oh, I shouldn't have you
do the chicken fillets.

02:10.997 --> 02:12.631
Excuse me.

02:12.631 --> 02:14.597
They're just doing
what they know,

02:14.597 --> 02:16.631
and it's not working.

02:16.631 --> 02:20.231
Ta-da! Sorry.
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

02:20.231 --> 02:21.597
It's okay.

02:21.597 --> 02:24.497
Yes, everybody is entertained
by their childishness...

02:26.331 --> 02:29.064
But it is a restaurant,
and we're here to serve food.

02:29.064 --> 02:30.000
That looks good.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.331
That looks good.

02:32.897 --> 02:34.464
Oops.

02:34.464 --> 02:37.231
You know what?
These guys can't cook!

02:37.231 --> 02:38.931
Hmm.

02:38.931 --> 02:40.864
We gotta figure a better way
to do the lasagna.

02:40.864 --> 02:43.397
We got too many people
saying it's overcooked.

02:43.397 --> 02:45.597
You think we should
cook it less?

02:45.597 --> 02:48.531
The food that comes out from
the kitchen looks terrible.

02:48.531 --> 02:50.531
What'd he say?
It wasn't cooked.
It's raw.

02:50.531 --> 02:52.264
Can't win 'em all.

02:52.264 --> 02:54.831
It's embarrassing.
It looks like nobody cares.

02:54.831 --> 02:57.031
You sure you don't
like raw chicken?

02:57.031 --> 03:00.000
Here is their issue--
Jim and Jeff are lazy.

03:00.000 --> 03:00.531
Here is their issue--
Jim and Jeff are lazy.

03:00.531 --> 03:04.131
All right, I'm going to the car.
Wake me up when it's over.

03:04.131 --> 03:07.631
Lazy is an understatement.
The twins' highest priority

03:07.631 --> 03:09.664
is doing as little work
as possible.

03:09.664 --> 03:12.597
There's something
that we're doing wrong,

03:12.597 --> 03:14.764
And I'm not sure
what it is,

03:14.764 --> 03:16.697
but the financial situation
hit the pooper--

03:16.697 --> 03:18.931
we're broke.

03:18.931 --> 03:21.631
Oops. Uh, pink
is never a good color.

03:21.631 --> 03:23.731
I haven't paid them
for a few months.

03:23.731 --> 03:26.797
We need help.
If things don't change,

03:26.797 --> 03:29.564
I would say the doors
will close quickly.

03:29.564 --> 03:30.000
Hello?

03:30.000 --> 03:31.431
Hello?

03:31.431 --> 03:34.564
No, the phone's
not working again.

03:34.564 --> 03:37.131
Fingers crossed that
Chef Ramsay's gonna help us.

03:46.097 --> 03:48.897
"Capri, Italian dining
since 1963."

03:48.897 --> 03:51.897
Closed since 1963?

03:51.897 --> 03:54.531
My God.

03:54.531 --> 03:57.397
Hideous.

03:57.397 --> 03:59.364
What am I doing?

03:59.364 --> 04:00.000
Hello?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.864
Hello?

04:01.864 --> 04:03.831
Hi there.

04:03.831 --> 04:06.464
How are you?
Pretty good. I'm Jeff.

04:06.464 --> 04:08.597
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

04:08.597 --> 04:10.864
Likewise. Uh, it looks shut
from outside.

04:10.864 --> 04:12.931
Uh, yeah,
we're not open yet.

04:12.931 --> 04:14.164
Oh, you're not open yet?
No.

04:14.164 --> 04:15.864
When do you open?
Uh, 4:00.

04:15.864 --> 04:17.931
Dinner only?
Yeah.

04:17.931 --> 04:20.631
And you're the owner?
Yeah, my brother
and I are.

04:20.631 --> 04:23.297
Okay, great.
Would you like
to meet my brother?

04:23.297 --> 04:25.297
Uh, yes, please.
What's his name?
Jim.

04:25.297 --> 04:27.564
Jim. And you're Jeff.
Yep.

04:27.564 --> 04:29.864
My God, look at this place.

04:32.264 --> 04:35.197
Okay...

04:35.197 --> 04:36.864
Okay.

04:36.864 --> 04:38.297
It's fun to play
jokes on people.

04:38.297 --> 04:40.331
In the twin union book,
you gotta mess with people.

04:40.331 --> 04:43.764
Hey, how's it going?
Jeff, is your brother
not available?

04:43.764 --> 04:45.864
No, I'm Jim.
No, come on.

04:45.864 --> 04:48.597
No, I'm his brother.
You're kidding me.

04:48.597 --> 04:50.097
No, I am.
Seriously.

04:50.097 --> 04:51.731
I am serious.
Jeff, go get Jim.

04:51.731 --> 04:54.697
Come on, don't--listen,
I've got work to do. Please.
Hold on.

04:54.697 --> 04:56.631
Hold on. Hold on,
I'll get him.

04:56.631 --> 04:58.697
What is this,
the comedy store?

04:58.697 --> 05:00.000
Bloody hell,
look at them.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.664
Bloody hell,
look at them.

05:01.664 --> 05:04.131
Are you kidding me?
Come on, guys.

05:04.131 --> 05:06.431
Jeff and Jim.
Yes.

05:06.431 --> 05:09.864
Correct.
Jeez.
Look at you two.

05:09.864 --> 05:11.831
You are identical.

05:11.831 --> 05:14.797
And you're not dressing
like this especially today--
No, no, we--

05:14.797 --> 05:16.797
we wear this as--
For the restaurant.
This is--

05:16.797 --> 05:19.931
you've even got the same
sneakers on.

05:19.931 --> 05:22.364
Pen there, pen there.
I didn't even
notice that.

05:22.364 --> 05:24.431
T-shirt there,
T-shirt there.
I didn't notice that.

05:24.431 --> 05:26.664
Bit of flour there,
bit of flour there.
Yep.

05:26.664 --> 05:28.897
It's quite scary.

05:28.897 --> 05:30.000
Jim...
Yep.

05:30.000 --> 05:30.031
Jim...
Yep.

05:30.031 --> 05:31.264
And Jeff.
Yep.

05:31.264 --> 05:34.664
So who's in charge?
He is.

05:34.664 --> 05:37.297
No, uh,
basically, I am.

05:37.297 --> 05:39.864
I've worked here
longer than he has.
Okay.

05:39.864 --> 05:41.631
Uh, but since 1963,
come on.

05:41.631 --> 05:44.297
Oh, no, no, we bought it
about 14 years ago.

05:44.297 --> 05:48.031
Okay. So why aren't you
open for lunch?

05:48.031 --> 05:50.864
The Capri's never open
for lunch, which is good.

05:50.864 --> 05:52.997
I'd rather go on the computer,

05:52.997 --> 05:55.431
watch TV, play poker...

05:55.431 --> 05:58.297
Problem is, for lunch, we'd have
to get another whole staff.

05:58.297 --> 06:00.000
Goof off, sit in the sun.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.631
Goof off, sit in the sun.

06:02.631 --> 06:05.397
You haven't
even tried it?
No, I haven't.

06:05.397 --> 06:07.331
No, I'm not ready
to jump into the lunch yet.

06:07.331 --> 06:10.097
Okay, but you're open
every day for dinner?

06:10.097 --> 06:12.397
Wednesday through Sunday.
Say that again?

06:12.397 --> 06:15.597
Wednesday through Sunday.
What's wrong with Monday, Tuesday?

06:18.397 --> 06:20.831
So help me
understand this.
Okay, right.

06:20.831 --> 06:22.731
So you're actually closed
longer than you're open.
Yeah.

06:22.731 --> 06:25.197
Really?
Mm-hmm.

06:27.397 --> 06:29.064
Okay, well,
thanks for updating me.

06:29.064 --> 06:30.000
I'm gonna sit down
and, uh, eat.
Please,
right over here.

06:30.000 --> 06:30.897
I'm gonna sit down
and, uh, eat.
Please,
right over here.

06:30.897 --> 06:32.931
Thank you.
Let me get you
some water.

06:32.931 --> 06:34.931
I'll get the water.

06:34.931 --> 06:36.631
No, I'll get the water.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.897
Jeez. Seriously?

06:40.897 --> 06:42.831
Are these menus
from 1963 as well?

06:42.831 --> 06:45.464
No, they're
getting old.

06:45.464 --> 06:48.397
I know, we have to get--
you're kidding me.
But look at that.

06:48.397 --> 06:50.564
Is this a joke?
That's not.

06:50.564 --> 06:52.664
You're kidding me.
I can't believe they're--
they're falling apart.

06:52.664 --> 06:56.231
You can't even read that,
it's so dirty.

06:56.231 --> 06:58.097
First impressions.
Wow.

06:58.097 --> 07:00.000
Okay, give me five minutes
to have a read of the menu...

07:00.000 --> 07:00.631
Okay, give me five minutes
to have a read of the menu...

07:00.631 --> 07:02.464
Okay.
Go ahead.

07:02.464 --> 07:05.031
And I'll--I'll catch up
with you guys later, yeah?
Okay.

07:05.031 --> 07:06.897
Holy crap.

07:06.897 --> 07:08.664
I don't know what
Chef Ramsay expected,

07:08.664 --> 07:11.097
But it's not a chichi place.
I'm not a chichi kind of guy.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.997
I'm more down to Earth.

07:13.997 --> 07:15.697
Hello.
Oh, hello.

07:15.697 --> 07:19.064
I'm Colleen.
I'm your server today.
Okay. Nice to see you.

07:19.064 --> 07:21.731
Colleen, how long
have you been here?
Nine and a half years.

07:21.731 --> 07:24.364
a decade?
Yeah.

07:24.364 --> 07:27.531
Seriously, what was the last
thing that got changed in here?
Oh...

07:27.531 --> 07:30.000
This is still the same way
the original owners had it.

07:30.000 --> 07:30.497
This is still the same way
the original owners had it.

07:30.497 --> 07:33.131
Really?
Wallpaper's been up there
for 35 years.

07:33.131 --> 07:34.797
Oh, God.

07:34.797 --> 07:36.964
Let's, uh, let's get
through the menu, yeah?

07:36.964 --> 07:40.097
Let's start off with, uh,
meatball sandwich.

07:40.097 --> 07:41.731
I love meatballs.
Who makes them?

07:41.731 --> 07:44.231
They come from a company
that we order from.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.931
You're kidding me.
No.

07:46.931 --> 07:49.264
You can't even make
a meatball?

07:49.264 --> 07:51.064
I can.

07:51.064 --> 07:53.631
Okay, let's go for
the meatball sandwich,

07:53.631 --> 07:55.064
and let's go with
the chicken scarpello.

07:55.064 --> 07:56.931
Okay, pizza.

07:56.931 --> 07:59.564
Ooh.
Let's go for
the Capri colossal.

07:59.564 --> 08:00.000
You want the big one?
Yeah, why not?

08:00.000 --> 08:02.164
You want the big one?
Yeah, why not?

08:02.164 --> 08:04.364
Okay.
Okay, I'll let you
put that order in.

08:04.364 --> 08:06.264
Okay.
Thank you.

08:06.264 --> 08:07.964
You're welcome.

08:07.964 --> 08:09.697
Okay, what do we
have to make?

08:09.697 --> 08:11.697
Chicken scarpello,
meatball sandwich,

08:11.697 --> 08:13.864
extra large colossal.
he wants an extra large?

08:13.864 --> 08:16.197
Jim, get me
an extra large dough.

08:16.197 --> 08:18.131
What does he want?
The colossal.

08:18.131 --> 08:20.531
All righty.

08:22.297 --> 08:24.664
So it's not just the menus.

08:24.664 --> 08:26.464
Oh, dear.

08:26.464 --> 08:28.931
Bits of sauce
down there. Crap.

08:28.931 --> 08:30.000
Ugh.
Just disgusting.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.264
Ugh.
Just disgusting.

08:31.264 --> 08:34.664
Bits of  everywhere.
There's tape on the carpet.

08:34.664 --> 08:37.464
Look at this place.

08:37.464 --> 08:39.831
When was the last time
the place was cleaned?
Not lately.

08:41.931 --> 08:44.597
How long has this stuff
been here?

08:44.597 --> 08:48.264
20 years.
20 years.
Bloody hell.

08:48.264 --> 08:49.597
Oh.

08:49.597 --> 08:52.031
It's like it's snowing.

08:52.031 --> 08:54.064
Oh, oh, my God.

08:54.064 --> 08:55.997
That's gross, no?

08:55.997 --> 08:57.697
Yes.
That's above people's--

08:57.697 --> 08:59.331
That's very--yes.
Jim,

08:59.331 --> 09:00.000
two seconds, please?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.997
two seconds, please?

09:01.997 --> 09:04.931
When was the last time
this place was cleaned?
Uh...

09:04.931 --> 09:07.731
Have you seen this?
No, I did not.

09:07.731 --> 09:09.764
My goodness, me.

09:09.764 --> 09:11.764
Who's responsible
for cleaning here?

09:11.764 --> 09:13.997
I'm responsible.
I didn't do it.

09:13.997 --> 09:16.197
Have you seen the fans?

09:16.197 --> 09:18.297
I do not like to clean.
I hate cleaning.

09:18.297 --> 09:20.531
To me, that's a 4-letter word.

09:20.531 --> 09:22.964
So I'm about to start eating,
I give that a little shake,

09:22.964 --> 09:26.064
and all of a sudden,
the dust just runs down.

09:26.064 --> 09:28.964
Let me wash my hands
before I start eating.

09:28.964 --> 09:30.000
What a mess.

09:30.000 --> 09:30.997
What a mess.

09:30.997 --> 09:33.897
You want to microwave
these meatballs, please?
Okay.

09:37.264 --> 09:39.264
Oh, come on.

09:39.264 --> 09:41.531
Work with me.

09:41.531 --> 09:43.631
Cheese.

09:46.264 --> 09:49.164
Sandwich is ready.

09:49.164 --> 09:51.197
okay, a meatball sandwich.

09:51.197 --> 09:53.197
Meatball sandwich.
Um...

09:55.231 --> 09:58.397
Okay, and so they buy the
meatballs, they defrost them,

09:58.397 --> 10:00.000
and then, has that been
microwaved, or...
Yes.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.097
and then, has that been
microwaved, or...
Yes.

10:01.097 --> 10:03.331
Thank you.

10:03.331 --> 10:05.497
Oh.

10:07.764 --> 10:10.431
Okay, what else
do we have to make?
A scarpello.

10:12.131 --> 10:15.164
That's nasty.

10:15.164 --> 10:17.164
When a restaurant can't even
bother to make a meatball,

10:17.164 --> 10:20.997
that's not a good sign,
let me tell you that.

10:27.431 --> 10:30.000
Someone should tell him
the chicken's definitely dead.

10:30.000 --> 10:30.397
Someone should tell him
the chicken's definitely dead.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.664
Not again.

10:36.997 --> 10:38.597
What's the matter
with these guys?

10:47.664 --> 10:49.664
Okay.

10:49.664 --> 10:53.097
Oh, my God.

10:53.097 --> 10:55.731
What in the hell is that?
The colossal pizza.

10:55.731 --> 10:57.264
Wow.

10:57.264 --> 10:58.964
I mean, it's someone's
cleared out the fridge.

10:58.964 --> 11:00.000
Look at it.
It's endless.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.297
Look at it.
It's endless.

11:01.297 --> 11:04.131
It has a little bit
of everything,

11:04.131 --> 11:07.297
except for anchovies.

11:07.297 --> 11:09.531
Ugh, that's dreadful.

11:09.531 --> 11:12.864
Okay, thank you.
Okay.

11:12.864 --> 11:15.931
The crap and the gunk
on top of it is just hideous.

11:15.931 --> 11:17.964
He didn't like
the pizza?

11:17.964 --> 11:20.564
He's not liking
anything.

11:20.564 --> 11:22.364
Oops.

11:25.931 --> 11:29.131
Okay, now we have
the chicken scarpello.

11:29.131 --> 11:30.000
Oh, wow.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.131
Oh, wow.

11:31.131 --> 11:32.831
It looks dull.

11:39.731 --> 11:42.331
That's not right.
Ooh.

11:42.331 --> 11:44.364
It smells.
Is that fresh?

11:44.364 --> 11:46.597
Um...

11:46.597 --> 11:50.264
Can you ask him how old
the chicken is, please?

11:50.264 --> 11:52.931
Oh, that was nasty.

11:52.931 --> 11:54.831
How old is the chicken?
I don't know.

11:54.831 --> 11:56.897
When did we get it?

11:56.897 --> 11:58.964
Uh, I don't know.

11:58.964 --> 12:00.000
We took it out
of the freezer yesterday.
Tell him
it's 14 years old.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.397
We took it out
of the freezer yesterday.
Tell him
it's 14 years old.

12:01.397 --> 12:04.431
We took it out
of the freezer yesterday.

12:04.431 --> 12:06.097
It's frozen,
it is not fresh,

12:06.097 --> 12:09.164
'cause we can't afford to keep
fresh meat here all the time,

12:09.164 --> 12:11.064
because we don't serve
that much.

12:11.064 --> 12:14.164
If he wants to donate money
so I can make it fresh,

12:14.164 --> 12:16.764
no problem, but otherwise,
tough.

12:16.764 --> 12:18.631
They're not open for lunch,
but so far,

12:18.631 --> 12:20.464
what I've just experienced,

12:20.464 --> 12:22.431
they shouldn't be open
for dinner either,

12:22.431 --> 12:24.431
he took it out of
the freezer yesterday,

12:24.431 --> 12:27.797
and doesn't remember
when the delivery was.

12:27.797 --> 12:30.000
Excuse me.

12:30.000 --> 12:30.497
Excuse me.

12:30.497 --> 12:32.531
Oh, dear. Excuse me.

12:40.564 --> 12:42.564
Ugh.

12:42.564 --> 12:45.931
Under the tables,
it's littered with gum.

12:45.931 --> 12:48.297
Colleen?
Yes?

12:48.297 --> 12:49.997
Look at that.

12:49.997 --> 12:52.264
It's everywhere. Ugh.

12:53.831 --> 12:55.697
Absolutely disgusting

12:55.697 --> 12:58.864
how lazy some people can be.

12:58.864 --> 13:00.000
Let's go on a gum ball rally.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.131
Let's go on a gum ball rally.

13:01.131 --> 13:03.364
Ugh.

13:03.364 --> 13:04.897
Oh, God,
under there.

13:04.897 --> 13:06.797
Look at the size of the gum
under that one.

13:06.797 --> 13:08.364
Oh, look at one
at the end.
And the corner.

13:08.364 --> 13:10.364
Oh, my God,
look at that one there.

13:10.364 --> 13:13.264
When was the last time
the tables were cleaned?

13:13.264 --> 13:14.931
Not ever, that I've known of,
underneath.

13:14.931 --> 13:17.697
They've never been
cleaned underneath?
No.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.297
Oh, my God. One, two,
three, four, five.

13:19.297 --> 13:22.064
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

13:22.064 --> 13:24.164
Six, seven, eight,
nine, ten.

13:24.164 --> 13:28.097
18, 19, 20 bits of gum.

13:28.097 --> 13:30.000
Every frickin' table...
Has gum underneath of it.

13:30.000 --> 13:30.997
Every frickin' table...
Has gum underneath of it.

13:30.997 --> 13:33.597
Has gum underneath.
Mm.

13:37.031 --> 13:40.064
No. Don't say that.

13:40.064 --> 13:43.097
Come on, stop crying.

13:43.097 --> 13:45.597
grow up,
you.

13:45.597 --> 13:48.931
you.

13:48.931 --> 13:51.631
Uh, Jim, Jeff.
Comin'.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.997
I'm really nervous.
Oh, dear.

13:53.997 --> 13:55.431
Dear, oh, dear,
oh, dear.

13:55.431 --> 13:57.597
I'm afraid of what
Chef Ramsay has to say.

13:57.597 --> 13:59.431
Honestly,

13:59.431 --> 14:00.000
You seem like nice guys,
but that was painful.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.364
You seem like nice guys,
but that was painful.

14:02.364 --> 14:05.264
The general feel of the place
is disgusting.

14:05.264 --> 14:07.597
I can tell how much
you don't care,

14:07.597 --> 14:10.331
you just stand there
with your foot on the booth.

14:10.331 --> 14:14.264
Can you get your dirty feet
off your own booths?

14:14.264 --> 14:16.731
Have a look at this.

14:16.731 --> 14:19.697
Every table is littered

14:19.697 --> 14:22.264
with stale disgusting gum.

14:22.264 --> 14:25.231
We just--we never looked
underneath the table.

14:25.231 --> 14:28.031
Didn't have the time?
Busy for lunch?

14:28.031 --> 14:30.000
No.
Open seven days a week?
Not.

14:30.000 --> 14:30.431
No.
Open seven days a week?
Not.

14:30.431 --> 14:33.197
The meatball sandwich--
disgusting.

14:33.197 --> 14:35.664
The chicken
was turning,

14:35.664 --> 14:37.697
and then the colossal,

14:37.697 --> 14:40.597
caked with crap. were they
canned mushrooms on top?
Yeah.

14:40.597 --> 14:42.897
Canned olives?
Mm-hmm.

14:42.897 --> 14:44.597
Soggy and tasteless.

14:44.597 --> 14:46.131
Where's the pride?

14:46.131 --> 14:49.131
I don't know.
Come on, guys.

14:49.131 --> 14:50.764
It's like a joke.

14:50.764 --> 14:53.631
Find a pulse,
and get real.

14:53.631 --> 14:55.564
Before we open
for dinner tonight,

14:55.564 --> 14:56.897
would you mind wiping
the lampshades,

14:56.897 --> 14:59.331
and can somebody
get under the tables

14:59.331 --> 15:00.000
- and get rid of that  gum?
-  yeah.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.731
- and get rid of that  gum?
-  yeah.

15:01.731 --> 15:03.297
I'm going for lunch.
I'll see you later.

15:03.297 --> 15:05.696
I'm  starving.

15:05.696 --> 15:08.330
Capri classic Italian.
What a joke.

15:11.196 --> 15:14.096
He said our food sucked.

15:14.096 --> 15:16.163
And, uh, that, uh,

15:16.163 --> 15:18.496
our restaurant's
really filthy.

15:21.763 --> 15:24.863
I didn't think it was that bad.

15:36.171 --> 15:37.904
After sampling
the horrendous food...

15:37.904 --> 15:39.371
That's not right.

15:39.371 --> 15:41.637
And discovering a dining room
that hasn't been cleaned

15:41.637 --> 15:43.337
in quite some time...

15:43.337 --> 15:44.871
Oh, God, under there.
Look.

15:44.871 --> 15:47.437
Chef Ramsay
has instructed the twins

15:47.437 --> 15:49.937
to clean up their restaurant
before dinner service.

15:49.937 --> 15:51.871
You do the fans. I don't
want to get on a ladder.

15:51.871 --> 15:53.404
Let's get Darian
in here.

15:53.404 --> 15:55.204
I have a staff
to do the cleaning.

15:55.204 --> 15:57.904
That's why I'm considered
the boss,

15:57.904 --> 16:00.671
and they are someone
that works with me--for me.

16:00.671 --> 16:01.531
Get in here, now.

16:01.531 --> 16:03.771
Get in here, now.

16:03.771 --> 16:06.737
We don't have a lot of time.
We have to turn everything over.

16:06.737 --> 16:10.104
We got an hour before
we're supposed to open.

16:13.937 --> 16:16.871
After the staff
takes over the cleaning

16:16.871 --> 16:19.204
of the dining room,
Capri opens for dinner...

16:19.204 --> 16:22.337
Hello.

16:22.337 --> 16:24.571
And Chef Ramsay arrives...
The door shakes.

16:24.571 --> 16:26.737
To see the twins
in action.

16:26.737 --> 16:29.804
I've never seen a kitchen
like this before.

16:29.804 --> 16:31.531
I mean, this place
is littered with crap.

16:31.531 --> 16:32.204
I mean, this place
is littered with crap.

16:32.204 --> 16:34.404
What's that there?
CO2 for the beer.

16:34.404 --> 16:36.371
Look at those shelves.

16:36.371 --> 16:39.404
I mean, that's grime.
That's like

16:39.404 --> 16:41.171
14 years of grime there.

16:43.137 --> 16:44.571
Chef Ramsay was, uh,

16:44.571 --> 16:46.671
"Oh, there's dust here,
there's this."

16:46.671 --> 16:49.671
It's just like,
it's not that bad.

16:49.671 --> 16:51.871
What's in here?
Dare I?

16:51.871 --> 16:54.571
Vegetables.
That's the vegetables?

16:54.571 --> 16:57.037
What's this
at the bottom?

16:57.037 --> 16:59.037
Uh, that's supposed
to be eggplant.
It's what?

16:59.037 --> 17:01.531
Eggplant Parmesan.
When were they cooked?

17:01.531 --> 17:02.037
Eggplant Parmesan.
When were they cooked?

17:02.037 --> 17:04.871
Last Thursday.
Last Thursday?
God almighty.

17:04.871 --> 17:06.637
Look at that.

17:06.637 --> 17:08.670
Oh, feel that.

17:08.670 --> 17:10.437
That's tomato sauce.
Yeah, but feel it.

17:10.437 --> 17:12.437
I know it's--
we just made it today.

17:12.437 --> 17:16.104
- Just made it today.
-  So what's it doing in the  fridge?

17:16.104 --> 17:18.470
Hold that.
I know it's hot.

17:18.470 --> 17:20.770
Hold it. What does
hot things do,

17:20.770 --> 17:23.537
that are sealed,

17:23.537 --> 17:25.804
that goes inside
a cold fridge?

17:25.804 --> 17:27.404
The sauce goes sour.

17:27.404 --> 17:29.304
I didn't know that.

17:29.304 --> 17:31.531
You didn't know that.

17:31.531 --> 17:31.937
You didn't know that.

17:31.937 --> 17:33.870
I suggest you spend
five minutes

17:33.870 --> 17:37.337
sorting out your  first before you start cooking, yeah?
Okay.

17:40.004 --> 17:41.470
I should've known better.

17:41.470 --> 17:44.537
He's right, but he's just
a pain in the ass about it.

17:44.537 --> 17:47.704
Darian.
Want to go through it
real quick?

17:47.704 --> 17:50.337
Yeah.
Trash.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.637
With the rotten vegetables
thrown away...

17:52.637 --> 17:54.304
I need an order
of wings, please.

17:54.304 --> 17:57.670
And the orders pouring in, Jim
and Jeff get back to cooking...

17:57.670 --> 18:00.504
Darian, order
of green beans, please.
Got it.

18:00.504 --> 18:01.531
And begin to send food
out of the kitchen.

18:01.531 --> 18:02.170
And begin to send food
out of the kitchen.

18:02.170 --> 18:04.704
Make sure they say a prayer
before they start eating that.

18:04.704 --> 18:06.304
Okay, the chicken.

18:06.304 --> 18:09.870
But the diners
are less than impressed.

18:12.804 --> 18:14.837
Okay. They sent this back.

18:14.837 --> 18:16.404
They didn't like it?

18:16.404 --> 18:18.670
They said that
he can't eat it.

18:18.670 --> 18:21.704
What was this?

18:21.704 --> 18:23.870
Okay.

18:25.370 --> 18:28.104
And a pile of mush.

18:28.104 --> 18:30.770
Big pile of mush.

18:30.770 --> 18:31.531
Is anyone tasting anything,
seasoning, tasting?

18:31.531 --> 18:33.604
Is anyone tasting anything,
seasoning, tasting?

18:33.604 --> 18:36.737
Every time a dish came back,
it was like losing a customer,

18:36.737 --> 18:39.370
and, uh, it hurts.
what was wrong with it?

18:39.370 --> 18:42.504
It's too floury
and not enough sauce.

18:42.504 --> 18:45.270
It makes me feel
like a loser.

18:45.270 --> 18:48.870
I do really feel
like a loser right now.

18:48.870 --> 18:51.537
Jeff,

18:51.537 --> 18:53.437
You okay?
What's wrong?

18:53.437 --> 18:55.770
I'm just frustrated.

19:00.604 --> 19:01.531
I'm--I'm working on it.
Just...

19:01.531 --> 19:03.037
I'm--I'm working on it.
Just...

19:03.037 --> 19:06.037
Get outside,
get some fresh air.

19:08.537 --> 19:10.570
What's the matter?

19:10.570 --> 19:13.437
Just...
It was a failure.

19:15.637 --> 19:18.537
Just...
You can't give up
like that.

19:18.537 --> 19:21.137
I'm not trying to,
just...

19:21.137 --> 19:23.504
It's not going right.

19:23.504 --> 19:26.504
I need to see what
I've got to work with

19:26.504 --> 19:29.737
before I can start looking
at any form of change.

19:29.737 --> 19:31.531
You have to
bounce back, huh?

19:31.531 --> 19:31.704
You have to
bounce back, huh?

19:31.704 --> 19:33.670
I'm working on it,
I really am.

19:33.670 --> 19:35.570
Jeff, you've got to.
Okay.

19:35.570 --> 19:38.237
Come on.
Okay.

19:38.237 --> 19:40.937
Let's go, come on.
Let's go.
Okay, okay.

19:40.937 --> 19:43.404
Chef Ramsay's, like, "You gotta
pull yourself together,

19:43.404 --> 19:45.770
get back in there
and get through the night."

19:45.770 --> 19:47.837
- How we doing?
- We're doing well, sir.

19:47.837 --> 19:49.970
Thanks to Chef Ramsay's
encouragement,

19:49.970 --> 19:52.204
Jeff jumps back
into dinner service...
Okay, here we go.

19:52.204 --> 19:54.804
And tries to help his brother
Jim get the kitchen

19:54.804 --> 19:56.770
back on track...
keep it up, Jim.
you're doing a good job.

19:56.770 --> 19:59.437
But unfortunately,
he only makes matters worse.

19:59.437 --> 20:01.531
Jim, what have you
done to those?

20:01.531 --> 20:01.870
Jim, what have you
done to those?

20:01.870 --> 20:03.337
I don't know
what happened to those.

20:03.337 --> 20:06.170
I-I really don't.
You defrosted them
in the bag?

20:06.170 --> 20:08.437
I think they were defrosted
in the bag, and I--
Jeff?

20:08.437 --> 20:11.537
Yeah.
The chicken tenders,

20:11.537 --> 20:13.504
what did you do to them
to defrost them?

20:13.504 --> 20:15.570
I put it, uh,
on the steam table.

20:15.570 --> 20:18.570
You defrosted them
in the steam table from frozen?

20:18.570 --> 20:20.770
Yeah.
Oh, my God.

20:20.770 --> 20:22.770
Not what you're
supposed to do?

20:22.770 --> 20:24.437
No.

20:24.437 --> 20:27.870
Frozen food needs to be
defrosted naturally.
Right.

20:27.870 --> 20:30.004
Give me the bag.
Where's the bag?

20:30.004 --> 20:31.531
Pass the--

20:31.531 --> 20:33.470
Pass the--

20:33.470 --> 20:36.337
Oh, God almighty.

20:36.337 --> 20:37.937
We can't serve them.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.937
You'll
kill somebody.

20:39.937 --> 20:42.237
Jim, talk to me.

20:42.237 --> 20:44.437
What am I supposed to say?
It's a mistake.

20:44.437 --> 20:46.970
It's a lethal mistake.

20:49.737 --> 20:51.204
It's really bad.

20:51.204 --> 20:53.704
It that what I ate
at lunchtime?

20:53.704 --> 20:56.170
- Yeah.
- Oh,.

20:56.170 --> 20:59.837
This is gross.
That's horrible.
It's disgusting.

20:59.837 --> 21:01.531
I've been feeling a little bit
crap all afternoon.

21:01.531 --> 21:02.337
I've been feeling a little bit
crap all afternoon.

21:02.337 --> 21:04.837
- What are you two doing?
- I  up.

21:04.837 --> 21:08.104
"I  up.
" Well, what do you want me to say?

21:08.104 --> 21:10.437
I want you to step up
to the plate and be a man.

21:10.437 --> 21:12.637
I screwed up.

21:12.637 --> 21:14.404
You haven't told
anyone yet.

21:14.404 --> 21:16.570
He was just being a jerk.
He was an ass.

21:16.570 --> 21:20.770
I am so tired of him
just pushing and pushing.

21:20.770 --> 21:22.670
Grow some balls
and take it off the menu.

21:22.670 --> 21:24.970
I've had enough.

21:24.970 --> 21:26.704
I'm so pissed!

21:26.704 --> 21:29.470
I can only take so much
before I fight back.

21:29.470 --> 21:31.531
Jim, Jim, Jim!
Out of the way.

21:31.531 --> 21:32.004
Jim, Jim, Jim!
Out of the way.

21:40.239 --> 21:42.239
It's an hour
into dinner service...

21:42.239 --> 21:44.872
Oh, God almighty.

21:44.872 --> 21:47.872
And Chef Ramsay has just
discovered a lethal mistake--

21:47.872 --> 21:49.839
spoiled chicken at Capri.

21:49.839 --> 21:51.739
You'll
kill somebody.

21:51.739 --> 21:55.039
- What am I supposed to say?
-  Take it off the  menu.

21:55.039 --> 21:56.639
Jim, Jim.

21:56.639 --> 21:57.905
Out of the way.

21:57.905 --> 22:00.872
Ladies and gentlemen,

22:00.872 --> 22:04.672
due to certain circumstance,
we have no chicken tonight.

22:06.772 --> 22:09.005
Oh...
My apology
to everyone here.

22:09.005 --> 22:11.439
If you just want to have

22:11.439 --> 22:13.805
what you're eating now
and leave,

22:13.805 --> 22:16.439
I understand fully,
and I apologize.

22:20.105 --> 22:24.272
Hey, there may have been a more
subtle way of doing that.

22:24.272 --> 22:26.505
- Get out of my way.
-  Is the matter with you?

22:26.505 --> 22:30.672
When we canceled all our chicken
orders, we got screwed.

22:30.672 --> 22:33.539
Will you stop
acting like a baby?
Oh, blow it
out your.

22:33.539 --> 22:35.505
Excuse me?
You heard it.

22:35.505 --> 22:35.928
Hey, need diaper
changing?

22:35.928 --> 22:38.239
Hey, need diaper
changing?

22:38.239 --> 22:39.839
I'll give you something--
is it that time
of night?

22:39.839 --> 22:42.439
Is there a little
poo-poo in your pants?

22:42.439 --> 22:45.472
He's the baby. He's the one
that's whining over everything.

22:45.472 --> 22:47.139
I don't need
to hear this crap.

22:47.139 --> 22:49.439
Jim, why do you have
to behave like this?

22:49.439 --> 22:51.972
I'm not gonna get
yelled at.
You're walking around
like a big baby,

22:51.972 --> 22:54.439
and I'm just asking you
to grow up a little bit,

22:54.439 --> 22:56.972
- show a little bit of respect for what you're trying to cook.
-  off.

22:56.972 --> 23:00.772
Oh, my God.
You big, wet noodle.

23:00.772 --> 23:02.272
Do you want a blanket
and a bottle?

23:02.272 --> 23:05.205
Do you need one?
Upside the head?

23:05.205 --> 23:05.928
- Jim, stop it, please.
- Oh, my God.

23:05.928 --> 23:06.939
- Jim, stop it, please.
- Oh, my God.

23:06.939 --> 23:10.405
- What a spoiled brat.
- You.

23:10.405 --> 23:12.505
Jim, shut up, please.

23:12.505 --> 23:15.639
You're not helping
the cause.
Oh, my God.

23:15.639 --> 23:19.105
Now you're setting
yourself on fire.
I hope so.

23:23.672 --> 23:26.172
Oh, yeah. They don't
get their way, they cry,

23:26.172 --> 23:28.039
- or throw a temper tantrum.
-  Oh, my God.

23:28.039 --> 23:30.538
To walk into the dining room
like that and scream...

23:30.538 --> 23:32.838
That's what I said--
temper tantrum.

23:32.838 --> 23:35.405
There's a part of me
that is very satisfied

23:35.405 --> 23:35.928
to see the boys finally get
what they deserve--

23:35.928 --> 23:39.172
to see the boys finally get
what they deserve--

23:39.172 --> 23:43.138
a lesson in humility.

23:43.138 --> 23:45.938
Okay, where are you
at now?
I don't know!

23:48.105 --> 23:51.272
Let me go check
on that for you.

23:51.272 --> 23:53.572
Can I pass you this? They've
been here since we opened,

23:53.572 --> 23:56.405
and they haven't
got their food yet.

23:56.405 --> 23:59.372
Jim, some of the tables
have been waiting

23:59.372 --> 24:01.705
two hours out there.
I know.

24:01.705 --> 24:04.905
Well, you don't even
seem to be bothered.
I am bothered.

24:04.905 --> 24:05.928
You know, there's only three
tables you served entrees.

24:05.928 --> 24:06.738
You know, there's only three
tables you served entrees.

24:06.738 --> 24:08.372
Come on, guys,

24:08.372 --> 24:10.805
just show a little bit
more enthusiasm, surely.

24:10.805 --> 24:13.738
No, it doesn't look good.
Damn it.

24:13.738 --> 24:16.638
This can't be happening.
It's just like a bad nightmare.

24:16.638 --> 24:19.338
Let's drink our wine
and go.

24:19.338 --> 24:21.672
Window wants to walk.
Cancel window.

24:21.672 --> 24:23.605
Customers were not happy.

24:23.605 --> 24:26.272
Some got tired of waiting and
left. It was very disappointing.

24:29.372 --> 24:31.405
It was a bad night.

24:31.405 --> 24:34.172
Our dishes took longer
than usual.

24:34.172 --> 24:35.928
It was just
an embarrassing night.

24:35.928 --> 24:37.072
It was just
an embarrassing night.

24:40.705 --> 24:44.371
Okay, today could be
summed up in one

24:44.371 --> 24:46.271
4-letter word.

24:46.271 --> 24:47.738
Lazy.

24:47.738 --> 24:50.205
I can't even start

24:50.205 --> 24:53.205
to help both of you when
you're not helping yourselves.

24:53.205 --> 24:55.505
I really need you
to do something.

24:55.505 --> 24:58.471
Both of you go through
your kitchen,

24:58.471 --> 25:01.538
and clean it.
not your staff.

25:01.538 --> 25:03.738
You. Both of you.

25:03.738 --> 25:05.538
- Got it?
- Yep.

25:05.538 --> 25:05.928
Good night.
Night.

25:05.928 --> 25:07.538
Good night.
Night.

25:07.538 --> 25:09.438
Get to work.

25:09.438 --> 25:11.138
We were lazy.
Now we're paying for it.

25:11.138 --> 25:12.971
We're failures.

25:15.071 --> 25:16.471
Yay.

25:21.671 --> 25:23.738
What's wrong, Jim?

25:27.971 --> 25:30.504
I feel bad.

25:30.504 --> 25:33.571
We are in trouble. I really
don't know if we can fix it.

25:33.571 --> 25:35.371
That's the problem.

25:38.738 --> 25:41.038
Go take a break, Jim.

25:51.238 --> 25:53.638
I gotta clean this.

26:00.276 --> 26:02.343
After the twins spend

26:02.343 --> 26:04.576
most of the night cleaning,

26:04.576 --> 26:06.809
Chef Ramsay arrives early,

26:06.809 --> 26:09.842
and with the help
of longtime waitress Colleen

26:09.842 --> 26:11.842
and pizza maker Darian,
he does something

26:11.842 --> 26:15.176
the twins have never done--
open for lunch.
Okay, Darian...

26:15.176 --> 26:16.476
Yes, sir?

26:16.476 --> 26:18.076
It's gonna be fast,
and it's gonna be furious,

26:18.076 --> 26:20.542
but you can do it, okay?
I'm game for this.

26:20.542 --> 26:22.342
How you doin'?

26:22.342 --> 26:24.242
Come in and have
some lunch.
Thank you.

26:27.442 --> 26:30.542
I would like
the lasagna, please.

26:30.542 --> 26:32.776
Pizza, up.

26:32.776 --> 26:34.242
Lasagna up.

26:34.242 --> 26:36.076
Lasagna. enjoy.

26:36.076 --> 26:37.342
This is delicious.

26:37.342 --> 26:39.942
Mmm, this is really good.
Yeah?

26:42.842 --> 26:45.576
Look at that.
We got a sign twirler.

26:45.576 --> 26:48.109
"Now open for lunch."

26:48.109 --> 26:51.509
Oh, cool.

26:51.509 --> 26:54.376
What's going on here?

26:54.376 --> 26:55.320
Oh, cool. Oh, wow.

26:55.320 --> 26:56.909
Oh, cool. Oh, wow.

26:56.909 --> 26:58.876
I can't believe
this is happening.

26:58.876 --> 27:01.109
Wow. This is our place?

27:01.109 --> 27:03.209
- All right, welcome.
-  Hi.

27:03.209 --> 27:05.542
Thanks for making it today.
Thank you.

27:05.542 --> 27:07.576
All right, take a seat.
Feeling a bit peckish?

27:07.576 --> 27:11.076
Yeah.
Yeah? Let me get you a nice
little chopped salad.

27:11.076 --> 27:13.776
This is different.

27:13.776 --> 27:15.876
Let's start off with
a little chopped salad.

27:15.876 --> 27:18.509
Thank you.
And make sure you save
some room

27:18.509 --> 27:20.576
for an Italian sausage
lasagna

27:20.576 --> 27:22.442
and a very simple,
um, margherita pizza.

27:22.442 --> 27:24.442
Thank you.

27:24.442 --> 27:25.320
It's a good pizza.
I like it.

27:25.320 --> 27:27.942
It's a good pizza.
I like it.

27:27.942 --> 27:30.676
Thank you.

27:30.676 --> 27:32.809
Okay,

27:32.809 --> 27:35.542
Whilst you two were at home
nice and cozy,

27:35.542 --> 27:38.642
I got here early this morning
with Darian and Colleen.

27:38.642 --> 27:42.376
I think today we put over $300
in the cash register.

27:42.376 --> 27:44.609
Wow.
Yeah.

27:44.609 --> 27:47.276
$300--if you do that
5 times a week,

27:47.276 --> 27:49.842
that's $1,500.
that's almost our rent,

27:49.842 --> 27:52.042
so it's a lot of money.
talk to me.

27:52.042 --> 27:55.042
I'm just...

27:55.042 --> 27:55.320
Very happy.

27:55.320 --> 27:56.776
Very happy.

27:56.776 --> 28:00.342
Jeff, I had my eyes shut,
and that was wrong.

28:00.342 --> 28:03.076
I sat on my butt,
being lazy.

28:03.076 --> 28:06.276
You can't have your butt stuck
to your bed every morning.

28:06.276 --> 28:09.042
You've gotta get out
and--and break the mold.

28:09.042 --> 28:10.942
Message understood,
loud and clear?

28:10.942 --> 28:13.042
Yep.
Loud and clear.

28:15.709 --> 28:18.276
After finally getting through

28:18.276 --> 28:20.476
to the twins
about their laziness,

28:20.476 --> 28:22.376
Chef Ramsay wants to dig
a little deeper.

28:22.376 --> 28:24.409
He has an unorthodox plan

28:24.409 --> 28:25.320
that will allow the brothers
to work out their issues

28:25.320 --> 28:26.442
that will allow the brothers
to work out their issues

28:26.442 --> 28:28.242
and their frustrations.

28:28.242 --> 28:30.376
Time to let go
of the past,

28:30.376 --> 28:33.109
and to embrace
the future.

28:33.109 --> 28:34.976
Gloves on.

28:34.976 --> 28:38.076
I'm not gonna be fighting
Chef Ramsay, am I?

28:38.076 --> 28:40.409
I want to know

28:40.409 --> 28:41.909
what's holding you back.

28:41.909 --> 28:44.709
One, two.

28:44.709 --> 28:47.842
Oh, for God's sake.
What is that?

28:47.842 --> 28:50.676
Two--what is that?
I don't work out.

28:50.676 --> 28:53.309
This is like starting
an old car

28:53.309 --> 28:55.276
after a year sitting there,
it's gonna go...

28:55.276 --> 28:55.320
Fart out a little bit.

28:55.320 --> 28:57.309
Fart out a little bit.

28:57.309 --> 28:59.642
Come on.

28:59.642 --> 29:01.842
What pisses you off the most?
What is it?

29:01.842 --> 29:04.442
Myself.

29:04.442 --> 29:06.876
Why?

29:06.876 --> 29:10.209
Huh?
'cause I'm lazy.

29:10.209 --> 29:12.809
When was the last time
you did something

29:12.809 --> 29:15.009
100%?

29:15.009 --> 29:17.376
I can't remember.

29:17.376 --> 29:20.242
What are you afraid of?
Tell me.

29:20.242 --> 29:22.409
Screwing up.

29:22.409 --> 29:25.320
Damn it.
It's just screwing up.

29:25.320 --> 29:25.342
Damn it.
It's just screwing up.

29:25.342 --> 29:27.876
I've done it
all my life.

29:27.876 --> 29:30.442
I'm a failure.
You're not a failure.

29:30.442 --> 29:32.442
Yes, I am.
You are not.

29:32.442 --> 29:35.042
We all make mistakes
in life.

29:35.042 --> 29:37.976
Embrace change.

29:40.309 --> 29:43.009
Are you keen
to make this business work?
Yeah.

29:43.009 --> 29:44.976
It's time.
I'm ready to move on,

29:44.976 --> 29:47.142
to make a success
out of this.

29:47.142 --> 29:48.909
Okay, last ten.
Let's go.

29:53.476 --> 29:55.320
And again. And again.
Come on, come on.

29:55.320 --> 29:56.109
And again. And again.
Come on, come on.

29:56.109 --> 29:59.409
Hit it.
Stop kissing it, come on.

29:59.409 --> 30:02.043
Come on.
And again.

30:02.043 --> 30:03.476
Ready to change?
Yes.

30:03.476 --> 30:04.776
Good man.
Yeah.

30:04.776 --> 30:07.008
Get the
out of here.

30:07.008 --> 30:09.742
I know I'm gonna put behind me
all the laziness,

30:09.742 --> 30:12.075
and look towards the future and
the successes that are coming.

30:12.075 --> 30:14.675
Jeff, let's go.

30:16.642 --> 30:19.242
Good, good, nice.

30:19.242 --> 30:21.609
It feels good
to just let out

30:21.609 --> 30:23.809
A whole bunch of
that I've been hanging on to.

30:23.809 --> 30:25.320
Nice, nice, nice.
Take a breather.

30:25.320 --> 30:25.609
Nice, nice, nice.
Take a breather.

30:25.609 --> 30:28.576
Good, wow. What does this
restaurant mean for you?

30:28.576 --> 30:31.176
A life, a career.

30:31.176 --> 30:33.542
And you think that by sitting
on your lazy ass all day long

30:33.542 --> 30:35.509
and turning up halfway through
the day is gonna make it work?

30:35.509 --> 30:38.076
You need to commit.

30:38.076 --> 30:40.442
Good. You, in here.

30:40.442 --> 30:42.142
Let's go.

30:42.142 --> 30:45.709
I don't want any head shots,
just one round,

30:45.709 --> 30:49.276
and tell each other
it's time to work.

30:49.276 --> 30:51.742
Let's go.

30:53.476 --> 30:55.320
We can work together.
we can work together.

30:55.320 --> 30:55.576
We can work together.
we can work together.

30:55.576 --> 30:58.609
And we can be successful. We
just gotta talk to each other,

30:58.609 --> 31:00.809
not keep anything inside.
yeah.

31:07.042 --> 31:09.842
Five, four, three,

31:09.842 --> 31:12.276
two, one.

31:12.276 --> 31:16.276
And stop. well done.
give him a hug.

31:16.276 --> 31:19.242
Boxing each other,
uh, was a good exercise,

31:19.242 --> 31:21.076
'cause it--
it cleared the air,

31:21.076 --> 31:23.242
and it showed me that
it's time for me

31:23.242 --> 31:25.320
to work hard for the business
for both of us.

31:25.320 --> 31:25.509
to work hard for the business
for both of us.

31:25.509 --> 31:28.009
Okay, good.

31:28.009 --> 31:31.009
It's time for change.
Got it?
Got it.

31:31.009 --> 31:33.042
Are you ready?
Ready.

31:33.042 --> 31:35.509
Good.
Get cleaned up,

31:35.509 --> 31:38.942
and meet me back
at the restaurant.

31:38.942 --> 31:41.376
Satisfied that the twins

31:41.376 --> 31:44.076
are ready to make some changes
within themselves...

31:44.076 --> 31:46.476
- Okay, how are you feeling?
-  Good.

31:46.476 --> 31:48.642
Chef Ramsay now wants
to focus on something else

31:48.642 --> 31:51.976
that needs a major change--
the food.

31:51.976 --> 31:54.309
When was the last time
you made a meatball?
Probably five years ago.

31:54.309 --> 31:55.320
Okay, and why did you stop?
It was easier.

31:55.320 --> 31:57.176
Okay, and why did you stop?
It was easier.

31:57.176 --> 31:59.776
Lazy!

31:59.776 --> 32:01.109
Oops.

32:01.109 --> 32:03.276
Let's make a meatball
together.
Okay.

32:03.276 --> 32:06.509
It's been a long time
since we've made meatballs,

32:06.509 --> 32:08.876
but I'm ready to do this.
I am a professional.

32:08.876 --> 32:10.876
Right.
Ground beef,

32:10.876 --> 32:13.042
season, yeah,
salt and pepper, garlic,

32:13.042 --> 32:15.676
handful of chili flakes.

32:15.676 --> 32:17.276
Chef Ramsay is a magician
in the kitchen.

32:17.276 --> 32:21.342
Oh, you just add this and this
and this, and it's just like...

32:21.342 --> 32:22.909
- Jeff...
- Yes?

32:22.909 --> 32:25.320
How big do you like your balls?
Uh,

32:25.320 --> 32:25.776
How big do you like your balls?
Uh,

32:25.776 --> 32:29.176
pretty good size,
I mean, you know...

32:29.176 --> 32:30.176
Golf ball size?

32:30.176 --> 32:33.242
What?

32:33.242 --> 32:36.842
All right,
have a little taste.

32:36.842 --> 32:40.042
What did you think?
It's good.
I like it a lot.

32:40.042 --> 32:41.809
Can you do that?
Yes.

32:41.809 --> 32:43.709
Can you do that
if he needs help?
Yes.

32:43.709 --> 32:45.476
Homemade meatballs.
Homemade meatballs.

32:45.476 --> 32:47.376
Yes.
The difference
is night and day.

32:47.376 --> 32:48.976
Homemade!
Homemade.

32:48.976 --> 32:50.209
Can't hear you.
Homemade!

32:50.209 --> 32:52.476
Can't hear you.
It's homemade meatballs!

32:52.476 --> 32:55.042
Get outside and shout it
in the  street.

32:55.042 --> 32:55.320
Homemade meatballs!
Tell them in the neighborhood.

32:55.320 --> 32:58.642
Homemade meatballs!
Tell them in the neighborhood.

32:58.642 --> 33:01.642
We have
homemade meatballs!
I can't hear you.

33:01.642 --> 33:04.109
We have
homemade meatballs!

33:04.109 --> 33:05.576
Finally.

33:05.576 --> 33:08.342
Stop, we have
homemade meatballs!

33:08.342 --> 33:10.909
We have homemade
meatballs!

33:10.909 --> 33:15.276
Everybody, we have
homemade meatballs!

33:23.798 --> 33:25.331
Faced with a restaurant

33:25.331 --> 33:27.964
that hasn't been touched
since 1963,

33:27.964 --> 33:30.064
Chef Ramsay and his team
work overnight

33:30.064 --> 33:32.498
to give this restaurant
one of the biggest makeovers

33:32.498 --> 33:35.698
in Kitchen Nightmare's
history.

33:35.698 --> 33:38.764
- Right, good morning.
- Good morning.

33:38.764 --> 33:41.364
You are in for a big shock.
Are you ready

33:41.364 --> 33:43.798
- to see the new Capri?
- Yes.

33:43.798 --> 33:46.264
Good. On the count
of three--

33:46.264 --> 33:49.131
one,

33:49.131 --> 33:50.432
two--don't peek...

33:50.432 --> 33:51.464
two--don't peek...

33:55.664 --> 33:58.698
Three.

33:58.698 --> 34:00.631
Oh, wow.

34:00.631 --> 34:02.364
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

34:02.364 --> 34:04.964
This is nice.

34:04.964 --> 34:07.031
Just have a look.

34:07.031 --> 34:10.098
We have brought the Capri
from 1963,

34:10.098 --> 34:13.331
fast forward it,
transformed it to 2011.

34:13.331 --> 34:15.531
That's beautiful.
Look at it.

34:15.531 --> 34:17.064
- Cool, hip.
- Oh, man.

34:17.064 --> 34:19.264
This place
is gonna be hoppin'.
This is nice.

34:19.264 --> 34:20.432
Oh, wow.
Gone is the carpet

34:20.432 --> 34:21.564
Oh, wow.
Gone is the carpet

34:21.564 --> 34:23.531
that was stuck
together with tape.

34:23.531 --> 34:25.064
You have the most amazing

34:25.064 --> 34:27.331
reclaimed woods
lining the walls.

34:27.331 --> 34:29.498
Look it.
Yeah, that's right.

34:29.498 --> 34:31.531
We had to put you
on the wall as well.

34:31.531 --> 34:33.164
Colleen, what do you think?
It's...

34:33.164 --> 34:34.864
Isn't it amazing?
It's amazing.

34:34.864 --> 34:37.431
We got rid of those
hideous green booths.

34:37.431 --> 34:40.031
You have the most amazing
tailor-made,

34:40.031 --> 34:41.831
cut pews as benches

34:41.831 --> 34:45.031
from your local church.
oh, wow.

34:45.031 --> 34:47.931
Sit down in the pew.
Are you happy?

34:47.931 --> 34:50.264
- Yeah.
- Like a pig in.

34:50.264 --> 34:50.432
Yeah! Whoo-hoo.
It's great.

34:50.432 --> 34:53.431
Yeah! Whoo-hoo.
It's great.

34:53.431 --> 34:55.564
Colleen.
Yes, sir?

34:55.564 --> 34:57.498
Come forward, darling,
and bring those menus

34:57.498 --> 34:59.864
from the pocket there.
oh, my goodness.

34:59.864 --> 35:02.631
Gone are the dirty
plastic menus.
Look it.

35:02.631 --> 35:04.698
Designed on what your kitchen
is capable of producing.

35:04.698 --> 35:06.731
So now it's time to stop
ignoring the business,

35:06.731 --> 35:09.098
and run the business.
okay.

35:09.098 --> 35:12.064
Yeah? I get nervous
when you don't talk.

35:12.064 --> 35:14.064
Huh?
He's--
he's totally stunned.

35:14.064 --> 35:17.098
Come on.
Just amazing.

35:17.098 --> 35:19.564
It really is.
I've never heard you
this quiet.

35:19.564 --> 35:20.432
I don't have
anything--
what's the matter?

35:20.432 --> 35:21.531
I don't have
anything--
what's the matter?

35:21.531 --> 35:24.431
Just amazing.
I'm in shock.

35:24.431 --> 35:26.464
I never thought it could
look so different.

35:26.464 --> 35:29.864
This is beyond what I could
ever think could happen.

35:29.864 --> 35:32.164
It's amazing.

35:32.164 --> 35:35.464
Wow. We're moving up,
and it's exciting.

35:35.464 --> 35:38.864
It's a second chance
on life.

35:38.864 --> 35:41.964
This is gonna be the coolest
place in Eagle Rock now.
Exactly that.

35:46.664 --> 35:48.898
Right. Come through, please.

35:48.898 --> 35:50.098
Look at this stuff.
Oh, my God.

35:50.098 --> 35:50.432
Let's start off with
meatballs al forno, yes?

35:50.432 --> 35:53.731
Let's start off with
meatballs al forno, yes?

35:53.731 --> 35:55.664
- What are they?
-  Homemade meatballs!

35:55.664 --> 35:58.264
Homemade meatballs.
Okay, sellers for the table,

35:58.264 --> 35:59.831
- welcome an Italian chopped salad.
-  yay.

35:59.831 --> 36:03.231
For me, the hallmark--
the pizza. The margherita.

36:03.231 --> 36:05.831
Classic eggplant parm pie.
Delicious,

36:05.831 --> 36:08.131
and just gives
a completely different twist.

36:08.131 --> 36:09.931
Now entrees--

36:09.931 --> 36:12.798
baked meat lasagna.
one of my favorites, yeah.
mmm.

36:12.798 --> 36:15.164
Baked herb chicken
with fingerling potatoes

36:15.164 --> 36:17.031
and a white wine sauce.
Jim?

36:17.031 --> 36:19.231
I like it, a lot.
That's Jeff.

36:19.231 --> 36:20.432
- It's cool. I'm Jeff.
- That's Jim.

36:20.432 --> 36:22.198
- It's cool. I'm Jeff.
- That's Jim.

36:22.198 --> 36:24.564
Right, a little taste?
Yes.

36:24.564 --> 36:27.198
Jump in.
All right.

36:27.198 --> 36:30.464
Oh, the broccoli
is so good.

36:30.464 --> 36:33.698
The food looks unbelievable,
and it even tastes better.

36:33.698 --> 36:37.264
It's excellent.
The eggplant
is amazing.

36:37.264 --> 36:38.598
I'm starting
to get full already,

36:38.598 --> 36:41.198
And I haven't tasted
half the stuff.

36:41.198 --> 36:44.164
Excuse me.

36:44.164 --> 36:46.231
Welcome!

36:46.231 --> 36:47.731
Put you right
over here, please.

36:47.731 --> 36:49.298
Word of Capri's relaunch

36:49.298 --> 36:50.432
has spread through
Eagle Rock...

36:50.432 --> 36:50.731
has spread through
Eagle Rock...

36:50.731 --> 36:51.998
We have a new menu.

36:51.998 --> 36:54.264
We have great salads
and appetizers to start with.

36:54.264 --> 36:55.898
And the dining room
fills up quickly

36:55.898 --> 36:57.998
with customers eager to try
the new menu.

36:57.998 --> 36:59.764
You wanna do
the Mac and cheese?

36:59.764 --> 37:01.631
Boneless chicken wings.

37:01.631 --> 37:03.198
- I'll go grab that and come back.
-  Thank you.

37:03.198 --> 37:05.498
All right, let's go.
Here you go, Jim.

37:05.498 --> 37:07.531
Medium margherita pizza
and a baked chicken.

37:07.531 --> 37:10.898
Okay.
And I want you to call it out
like a chef/owner.

37:10.898 --> 37:12.964
Okay, I got two--

37:12.964 --> 37:15.798
What is that?
Pot-potato skins,

37:15.798 --> 37:18.098
two wings.
Yes, sir.

37:18.098 --> 37:20.331
How you doin', Jim?

37:20.331 --> 37:20.432
I'm nervous, but I have
to believe that I am in charge,

37:20.432 --> 37:23.764
I'm nervous, but I have
to believe that I am in charge,

37:23.764 --> 37:25.498
and I know what I'm doing.

37:28.898 --> 37:31.398
Own it, own it,
own it, own it, yeah?
Yeah.

37:31.398 --> 37:32.798
Gonna leak from the top,
buddy.

37:32.798 --> 37:35.131
In spite of Jim's nerves...

37:35.131 --> 37:37.031
Table five is ready.
Pick it up, please!

37:37.031 --> 37:40.031
Food is quickly making its way
out to the diners.
Not hot enough.

37:40.031 --> 37:43.564
- Perhaps a little too quickly.
-  Me.

37:43.564 --> 37:46.264
Listen, guys. Guys,
the chicken's not hot enough,

37:46.264 --> 37:48.331
especially inside there.

37:48.331 --> 37:50.064
Get it in the oven,
get the pan hot first.

37:50.064 --> 37:50.432
Jim I think was starting
to really get a little panicky.

37:50.432 --> 37:53.931
Jim I think was starting
to really get a little panicky.

37:53.931 --> 37:55.664
Jim, give me a time
on the chicken, please.

37:55.664 --> 37:57.997
I-I-I got the chicken
in--in the--

37:57.997 --> 38:00.431
what's in the pan and stuff,
it's heating up.

38:00.431 --> 38:02.131
Jim, bounce back.
Yep.

38:02.131 --> 38:04.397
It's not a race. Customers
will wait for good food.

38:04.397 --> 38:06.664
Hot food in the window.
I'm dragging
the meatballs.

38:06.664 --> 38:08.464
Here's spaghetti
meatball.

38:08.464 --> 38:11.964
Yeah. Is that how
I showed you

38:11.964 --> 38:14.431
to plate a spaghetti meatball?
no.

38:14.431 --> 38:16.631
It looks like someone
on my plate.

38:16.631 --> 38:19.064
Damn it, Jim.
It's like, come on.

38:19.064 --> 38:20.432
It's so easy.
Just on.

38:20.432 --> 38:21.497
It's so easy.
Just on.

38:21.497 --> 38:23.731
And you're more than capable
of doing that, I'm telling you.

38:23.731 --> 38:25.964
It's not rocket science.

38:25.964 --> 38:28.097
You can't even
grate  cheese.

38:28.097 --> 38:30.964
No, no. Stop panicking,
and focus!

38:30.964 --> 38:33.864
I'm panicking right now, 'cause
we want to get food out quick.

38:35.464 --> 38:38.331
But it's like,
hey, don't screw this up.

38:38.331 --> 38:41.264
Uh...

38:41.264 --> 38:45.264
It's an hour into service...

38:45.264 --> 38:47.497
And Jim is struggling
to keep up with the orders.

38:47.497 --> 38:50.097
Jim, how much longer
on my table four?
It's coming up
right now.

38:50.097 --> 38:50.432
Unfortunately, a relaunch
that had such promise...

38:50.432 --> 38:53.497
Unfortunately, a relaunch
that had such promise...

38:53.497 --> 38:56.764
They--did you really?
I did not see them.
Yes.

38:56.764 --> 39:00.031
Looks like it's slipping away.
Your chicken's coming also.

39:00.031 --> 39:01.831
Jim, look at me. What table
number is that for?

39:01.831 --> 39:04.364
16 is--darian,
you cutting it right now?

39:04.364 --> 39:05.831
I got a mushroom
and a meat lover.

39:05.831 --> 39:07.831
Put it right up.
Okay.

39:07.831 --> 39:09.697
This is going to 16.

39:09.697 --> 39:12.197
They haven't even
got their appetizers.

39:12.197 --> 39:15.064
Oh, for  sake.
God darn it.

39:15.064 --> 39:18.431
Oh, come on. Come in, you.
Come here, both of you.

39:18.431 --> 39:20.432
I need you for 30 seconds,
out of all this.

39:20.432 --> 39:20.997
I need you for 30 seconds,
out of all this.

39:20.997 --> 39:23.331
Oh, . Oh, man,
we're doing this again.

39:23.331 --> 39:25.197
I thought we got through this.

39:25.197 --> 39:27.064
Please don't let this
be the end.

39:27.064 --> 39:30.064
No, no, no,
no, no, no.  that.

39:38.755 --> 39:41.221
It's relaunch night at Capri,

39:41.221 --> 39:43.621
and with the kitchen
backed up...

39:43.621 --> 39:46.454
Jim, give me a time
on the chicken, please.
The chicken
in--in the--

39:46.454 --> 39:49.521
what's in the pan and stuff,
it's heating up.
and diners waiting
over an hour for food...

39:49.521 --> 39:52.488
Come here, both of you.
Chef Ramsay
has seen enough.

39:52.488 --> 39:54.554
No, no, no, no.  that.
Look at me. Look at me.

39:54.554 --> 39:57.354
Right now you're making
yourselves look stupid.
Right.

39:57.354 --> 39:59.221
It's a big night tonight.
Yes.

39:59.221 --> 40:00.988
And you're
pissing it up.
Yes.

40:00.988 --> 40:02.754
So please listen to me,

40:02.754 --> 40:04.539
you have to command
your kitchen.
yes.

40:04.539 --> 40:04.721
you have to command
your kitchen.
yes.

40:04.721 --> 40:06.654
You have to work together.
But it's not a race.

40:06.654 --> 40:08.488
The customers are gonna
wait for good food.

40:08.488 --> 40:11.254
Stop panicking,
and focus, okay?
Yes.

40:11.254 --> 40:13.921
Come on!

40:13.921 --> 40:16.788
Chef Ramsay is like,
"What the  is this?

40:16.788 --> 40:18.488
How could"...

40:18.488 --> 40:21.354
And I go, ugh.

40:21.354 --> 40:23.354
We slip back into our old ways
of doing it,

40:23.354 --> 40:24.988
and it's like,
you gotta change.

40:24.988 --> 40:26.521
This is a new Capri.

40:26.521 --> 40:30.221
I need an order of garlic knots
and pepperoni and cheese.

40:30.221 --> 40:32.188
Yes, sir!
Go help him.
I'll take care of this.

40:32.188 --> 40:34.539
- Got it.
- It's time that I grew up.

40:34.539 --> 40:35.054
- Got it.
- It's time that I grew up.

40:35.054 --> 40:37.921
It's time that I start working
as a man and not as a butthead.

40:37.921 --> 40:40.488
Sausage and bean.
Put some cheese on it.
I put beans
on this, right?

40:40.488 --> 40:42.821
Yeah--oregano.
Oregano.

40:42.821 --> 40:45.421
Okay, Jim, now we're
getting a system.

40:45.421 --> 40:46.654
Conviction, yes?
Yep.

40:46.654 --> 40:48.488
What's next?
16.

40:48.488 --> 40:50.054
Good.
I got hot food up here.
Please serve it.

40:50.054 --> 40:52.421
Once we started hitting
our rhythm, it was great.

40:52.421 --> 40:54.388
'Cause things
were going out.
Excuse me.

40:54.388 --> 40:56.521
We settled down,
and we got it zooming along.

40:56.521 --> 40:58.288
How we doing?
So good.

40:58.288 --> 41:00.654
The meatballs
are our favorite thing.

41:00.654 --> 41:03.421
This is really good, though.
It's delicious.

41:03.421 --> 41:04.539
This is made from scratch,
you can tell.

41:04.539 --> 41:05.388
This is made from scratch,
you can tell.

41:05.388 --> 41:07.254
This is so amazing.

41:07.254 --> 41:09.354
It's been one hell
of a roller coaster ride,

41:09.354 --> 41:11.754
but we've learned a lot
from Chef Ramsay,

41:11.754 --> 41:14.621
and he's left us with a lot
of inspiration and hope.

41:14.621 --> 41:16.888
I can see that we will make it

41:16.888 --> 41:20.754
if we keep doing
what we're doing.

41:20.754 --> 41:23.054
Jim,

41:23.054 --> 41:24.454
Jeff,

41:24.454 --> 41:26.888
you've come a long way.
it's been a tough journey.

41:26.888 --> 41:30.588
Yes.
And in order for this place
to continue functioning,

41:30.588 --> 41:33.454
you both must
work at it.

41:33.454 --> 41:34.539
Yes.
Don't clutter.

41:34.539 --> 41:34.921
Yes.
Don't clutter.

41:34.921 --> 41:36.788
Yes.
Show up early.

41:36.788 --> 41:39.288
Yes.
Lazy is a 4-letter word.

41:39.288 --> 41:42.054
Yes.
Good.

41:42.054 --> 41:45.021
God bless you both.

41:45.021 --> 41:46.821
Thank you so much.
Okay?

41:46.821 --> 41:50.088
Yeah, thank you
very much.
Good luck.

41:50.088 --> 41:52.654
We've went through a lot
to get--

41:52.654 --> 41:55.721
you know, to get the nightmare
into a-a dream.

41:55.721 --> 41:57.688
It's still
a learning process,

41:57.688 --> 41:59.254
but the future
looks really good.

41:59.254 --> 42:01.454
The Capri is gonna work.

42:01.454 --> 42:03.688
Good luck.

42:03.688 --> 42:04.539
God, honestly,
I'm never gonna forget

42:04.539 --> 42:06.054
God, honestly,
I'm never gonna forget

42:06.054 --> 42:08.188
the twins in Eagle Rock,
let me tell you that.

42:08.188 --> 42:10.621
Thank you.
Good night.

42:10.621 --> 42:12.354
Thank you very much.
Jeez.

42:12.354 --> 42:15.021
Yes.

42:15.021 --> 42:17.054
Wow. That was hard.

42:17.054 --> 42:19.088
I mean, really hard,

42:19.088 --> 42:21.588
but I now really believe
that both Jim and Jeff

42:21.588 --> 42:24.588
and their little restaurant can
become a huge tourist attraction

42:24.588 --> 42:26.588
here in Eagle Rock.

42:26.588 --> 42:28.654
Now come on--

42:28.654 --> 42:31.588
who doesn't love a pizza
and a show?

42:31.588 --> 42:33.554
Oh...

42:33.554 --> 42:34.539
That was hard.

42:34.539 --> 42:35.588
That was hard.

42:35.588 --> 42:38.588
Man.

42:38.588 --> 42:41.921
Just one month after
Chef Ramsay's departure...

42:41.921 --> 42:45.588
Can I take a picture
of you two with Jen?
You sure can.

42:45.588 --> 42:48.721
The twins kept their promise,
and opened for lunch.

42:48.721 --> 42:50.688
It's excellent.
It's really good.

42:50.688 --> 42:52.688
The new food and décor
have made Capri

42:52.688 --> 42:54.588
a hot spot
in Eagle Rock.

42:54.588 --> 42:56.588
Come back again, we're gonna
keep this going now.

42:56.588 --> 42:59.154
This has been
a life-changing experience.

42:59.154 --> 43:00.454
Thank you very much,
Chef Ramsay,

43:00.454 --> 43:02.587
for what you did for us.

43:02.587 --> 43:04.520
I think
it's gonna work.
It's gonna work.

43:04.520 --> 43:04.539
By the way, we have
homemade meatballs! Yeah!

43:04.539 --> 43:07.520
By the way, we have
homemade meatballs! Yeah!
