00:06.530 --> 00:09.490
Previously on
"Berlin Station"...
Listen to this...

00:09.533 --> 00:12.075
<i>He was the CIA's
go-to wetworks man in Berlin.</i>

00:12.119 --> 00:13.410
<i>Diver was the best.</i>

00:13.454 --> 00:15.454
Hey, what's the BB stand for
by the way?

00:15.498 --> 00:17.184
For me to know
and you not to find out.

00:17.208 --> 00:19.124
You new to the building?

00:19.168 --> 00:20.459
Yes, I'm new.

00:20.503 --> 00:21.688
Welcome. I'm Robert.

00:21.712 --> 00:23.253
Nice to meet you.
I'm Nina.

00:23.297 --> 00:25.775
You get Sofia out? Valerie wants
her as a countermeasure.

00:25.799 --> 00:27.986
She's about to board. You get
my sitrep on the shooting?

00:28.010 --> 00:29.988
- Why'd your sniper miss?
- He meant to.

00:30.012 --> 00:32.115
Those rounds hit
exactly where he intended.

00:32.139 --> 00:34.056
Something's wrong.
10:00 a.m. No Daniel.

00:34.099 --> 00:35.766
I have the last known
coordinates.

00:35.809 --> 00:37.976
Well, he is officially
out of contact

00:38.020 --> 00:39.311
and he is officially missing.

00:39.355 --> 00:40.938
Have you been following Estonia?

00:40.981 --> 00:42.606
We are aware
of the situation, yes.

00:42.650 --> 00:44.483
And do you agree that
it's serious?

00:44.527 --> 00:47.611
The level of seriousness depends
on the level of proof.

00:47.655 --> 00:50.989
The unrest is growing, and of
course Russia is involved.

00:51.033 --> 00:53.575
From what I've seen,
it's Article 5 serious.

00:53.619 --> 00:56.286
An attack on Estonia
is an attack on America.

01:02.545 --> 01:04.336
That's the witness
who poisoned Henrik.

01:04.379 --> 01:05.857
Well, got to give them credit.

01:05.881 --> 01:07.484
They're willing to tear down
their monuments

01:07.508 --> 01:09.402
and kill their own people
in order to sell the story.

01:09.426 --> 01:11.134
Leave him alone!

01:11.178 --> 01:12.239
You don't want to get
involved in this.

01:12.263 --> 01:14.221
Try me.

01:14.265 --> 01:16.076
It's okay, April. You go.
I will take care of him.

01:16.100 --> 01:19.142
I found something. You might
want to brace yourself.

01:19.186 --> 01:22.020
Ground zero of Miller's
last known coordinates.

01:22.064 --> 01:26.066
Torres, do not... I repeat,
do not move the body.

01:26.110 --> 01:27.526
Copy that.

06:23.574 --> 06:25.657
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

06:25.701 --> 06:27.659
Stop right there.

06:27.703 --> 06:30.328
On your knees!
Get away from the bag!

06:30.372 --> 06:34.541
Hands behind your head now!

06:34.585 --> 06:37.294
Fingers interlocked
behind your head!

06:37.337 --> 06:41.506
I need to speak
to Major Dominic Kingsbury.

06:41.550 --> 06:43.633
Tell him it's Torres.

06:43.677 --> 06:45.218
Phone it in.

07:04.072 --> 07:06.114
Hey, Romy.

07:06.158 --> 07:07.949
Valerie, watch.

07:07.993 --> 07:09.910
Look at you.

07:09.953 --> 07:13.413
According to the expert here,

07:13.457 --> 07:14.976
ballet never becomes easy.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.394
It becomes...
What is it?

07:16.418 --> 07:18.479
Possible.
Poss...
It becomes possible.

07:18.503 --> 07:21.296
What are those?
Oh, honey...

07:21.340 --> 07:22.631
Hey, goose.

07:22.674 --> 07:25.425
Why don't you go to the fridge

07:25.469 --> 07:28.136
and get out some fixins,
and I will make you a scramble?

07:28.180 --> 07:29.240
Okay.
Yeah?

07:29.264 --> 07:31.024
Yeah.
Okay.

07:33.977 --> 07:38.104
Are you okay?

07:38.148 --> 07:40.023
I'm really sorry.
I'm sorry.

07:40.067 --> 07:41.920
You need some sleep.
You need some actual.

07:41.944 --> 07:45.445
Like, in a bed. A bed.

07:45.489 --> 07:47.759
Whatever's going on at work,
you got to...

07:47.783 --> 07:49.052
you got to be able to let it go.

07:49.076 --> 07:51.242
You know?
Mm-hmm.

07:51.286 --> 07:53.348
I may not be mother of the year,

07:53.372 --> 07:56.957
but if Romy
saw those pictures...

07:57.000 --> 07:59.417
I know, I know, I know.

07:59.461 --> 08:00.919
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

08:00.963 --> 08:02.462
I promise it won't happen again.

08:02.506 --> 08:04.359
We're out of eggs, Auntie Val.

08:04.383 --> 08:06.653
We are out of eggs, Auntie Val.

08:06.677 --> 08:08.843
That is not surprising
in the slightest.

08:08.887 --> 08:11.199
No, it's not.
I know.
Bachelor fridge.

08:11.223 --> 08:13.473
Any word on when
the body will be back in Berlin?

08:13.517 --> 08:15.662
No, it looks like we'll be
in limbo for at least a week.

08:15.686 --> 08:17.143
Bureaucracy...

08:17.187 --> 08:19.479
You know, I've heard
fucking zilch from Torres.

08:19.523 --> 08:21.022
What about you?

08:21.066 --> 08:24.526
No. But it's only been a day.
Give him a minute.

08:24.569 --> 08:26.297
Robert,
you haven't been sleeping.

08:26.321 --> 08:27.840
I can hear it in your voice.

08:27.864 --> 08:30.510
Are you taking anything
for it?
Nada.

08:30.534 --> 08:33.368
If I take Ambien,
I make mystery sandwiches.

08:33.412 --> 08:35.056
So what have you been doing
all night?

08:35.080 --> 08:38.123
Oh, combing through maritime
reports on the Baltics,

08:38.166 --> 08:40.625
sat surveillance, naval drills,

08:40.669 --> 08:42.669
anything that might point
to Russia.

08:42.712 --> 08:45.463
If they cut off access to
the Baltic Sea,

08:45.507 --> 08:47.318
NATO would be seriously fucked.

08:47.342 --> 08:49.134
- And?
- Nothing.

08:49.177 --> 08:52.595
You know, Valerie, it's never
good when the drums go quiet.

08:52.639 --> 08:54.367
Let's just not broach anything

08:54.391 --> 08:56.327
that we can't prove in our phone
call to Langley this morning.

08:56.351 --> 08:59.185
Oh...

08:59.229 --> 09:00.937
you know what?

09:00.981 --> 09:02.063
About that call...

09:02.107 --> 09:03.960
Maybe we should hold off on it.

09:03.984 --> 09:07.318
Jesus, Robert. You have been
all over me to bring Langley in.

09:07.362 --> 09:09.590
You know what? Yesterday I was
in a guilt trip about Daniel.

09:09.614 --> 09:11.551
I wasn't thinking straight.
You're right, though.

09:11.575 --> 09:14.367
We don't have enough evidence
to convince Jason Wolfe.

09:14.411 --> 09:17.704
And you don't like him.
No. No the fuck I don't,
Valerie.

09:17.748 --> 09:19.164
And neither do you.

09:19.207 --> 09:21.227
Yeah, but I don't let it
get in my way.

09:21.251 --> 09:22.625
SCIF in an hour.

09:28.341 --> 09:30.842
- Robert... hi.
- Hey.

09:30.886 --> 09:33.094
Just coming off a late shift?

09:33.138 --> 09:35.430
Friend's party.

09:35.474 --> 09:40.143
It was better than I expected.
I was having fun, so I stayed.

09:40.187 --> 09:41.686
Bit of a mess...

09:41.730 --> 09:42.979
No, you look great.

09:43.023 --> 09:46.191
No, I-I mean you.

09:46.234 --> 09:48.151
Oh.

09:52.616 --> 09:54.552
I got too much breakfast.

09:54.576 --> 09:55.928
Want to join me?
No.

09:55.952 --> 09:58.411
I mean, yes. I do actually.
Very much.

09:58.455 --> 10:01.289
But I'm late
and I have to get to work. So...

10:01.333 --> 10:03.958
Rain check, then.

10:04.002 --> 10:07.796
You're an odd duck, aren't you?

10:07.839 --> 10:10.590
I like odd ducks.

10:18.225 --> 10:19.891
Hey, almost there.

10:19.935 --> 10:22.288
How was she when you
picked her up at the airport?

10:22.312 --> 10:23.853
A little shaken,
but she's tough.

10:23.897 --> 10:26.189
Everything's set up in
the safe house for her to work.

10:26.233 --> 10:28.461
If we can trace
who targeted her,

10:28.485 --> 10:30.171
we have a big piece
of this puzzle.

10:30.195 --> 10:31.464
I'm just wondering why the CIA

10:31.488 --> 10:33.154
is so interested
in protecting Sofia.

10:33.198 --> 10:35.593
We're going to need to stitch
Estonia back together.

10:35.617 --> 10:38.243
Sofia could be an important
agent of influence.

10:38.286 --> 10:40.036
She strikes me
as the kind of person

10:40.080 --> 10:42.288
that does things
on her own terms.

10:42.332 --> 10:46.042
Her terms and ours don't have to
be mutually exclusive.

10:46.086 --> 10:48.503
She needs a friend right now,
April.

10:48.547 --> 10:51.756
Someone she can trust. Someone
who understands her work.

10:51.800 --> 10:55.260
And that person is you.
How's Dove?

10:55.303 --> 10:58.304
Any facial-recognition hits
on his attacker?
Still searching.

10:58.348 --> 11:00.974
Concentrating on Nigeria since
Dove seemed to know him.

11:01.017 --> 11:02.787
All we know now
is that it's not Boka Haram

11:02.811 --> 11:03.977
or any other known cell.

11:04.020 --> 11:05.832
If I haven't said it lately,
April...

11:05.856 --> 11:07.750
you're making
all the right calls.

11:07.774 --> 11:08.940
Be careful.

11:08.984 --> 11:10.483
So don't fuck it up, right?

11:10.527 --> 11:11.901
Precisely.

11:11.945 --> 11:14.988
- Morning.
- Hey.

11:15.031 --> 11:16.281
Sleep all right?

11:16.324 --> 11:18.678
My mind wouldn't
stop spinning, so...

11:18.702 --> 11:21.077
Thank you.
What do we have going on?

11:21.121 --> 11:22.829
Okay...

11:22.873 --> 11:26.291
So this was sent over 2,000
times, just seconds apart,

11:26.334 --> 11:27.917
all from fake accounts.

11:27.961 --> 11:30.545
And there are hundreds more
feeds just like it.

11:30.589 --> 11:33.715
Massive. I mean,
I flagged a few bots, but...

11:33.758 --> 11:35.820
The spread was definitely
coordinated

11:35.844 --> 11:37.302
across multiple platforms,

11:37.345 --> 11:40.054
meaning these engineers
were skilled.

11:40.098 --> 11:41.556
Russians.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.828
The trolls have been busy, yes.

11:43.852 --> 11:45.393
I just need to prove it.

11:45.437 --> 11:47.103
You know,
I followed your career.

11:47.147 --> 11:51.274
I know you made it cool
for girls to code, so...

11:51.318 --> 11:53.943
I can imagine this hurts.

11:53.987 --> 11:56.779
It's fine.

11:56.823 --> 11:58.323
You're not a good liar.

12:01.286 --> 12:03.514
I really appreciate the support.

12:03.538 --> 12:05.933
Not what I was expecting
from the CIA,

12:05.957 --> 12:08.416
but then neither are you.

12:12.380 --> 12:14.797
What the...?

12:14.841 --> 12:16.799
This is not who we are.

12:16.843 --> 12:19.469
If I could go back to Tallinn,

12:19.512 --> 12:21.532
maybe I could change some minds,
calm people down...

12:21.556 --> 12:22.972
No, you can't. Not now.

12:23.016 --> 12:24.327
The same people
that killed Henrik

12:24.351 --> 12:26.809
are primed and ready
to take you out, too.

12:26.853 --> 12:29.479
Or worse, let an angry mob
do it for them.

12:29.522 --> 12:30.855
I need to do something.

12:30.899 --> 12:32.315
You can.

12:32.359 --> 12:35.985
Prove it.

12:36.029 --> 12:37.654
Shit.

12:37.697 --> 12:40.740
But why is the CIA
calling the Finnish EPA

12:40.784 --> 12:44.827
about the Russian Navy
and not Finnish intelligence?

12:44.871 --> 12:47.431
Because you guys have your
finger on the pulse

12:47.457 --> 12:49.977
of what's really happening
in the Baltic Sea.

12:50.001 --> 12:53.211
You're a shit liar, Robert.

12:53.255 --> 12:56.005
You can't get them
to return a call, hmm?

12:56.049 --> 12:58.841
Are you gonna help me, Cedric,
or not?

13:01.263 --> 13:03.763
I don't envy you, my man.

13:03.807 --> 13:05.306
Tough time to be an American.

13:05.350 --> 13:07.767
Yeah. Can we get on with it,
please?

13:07.811 --> 13:11.604
We have detected
no recent Russian naval activity

13:11.648 --> 13:13.231
in the Baltic Sea.

13:13.275 --> 13:16.150
That's it? T-That's it?
That's all you got for me?

13:16.194 --> 13:17.652
Nothing unusual

13:17.696 --> 13:21.739
outside of trawler falling off
the radar this morning

13:21.783 --> 13:23.283
in the Gulf of Finland.

13:23.326 --> 13:25.702
Probably just fishing illegally.

13:25.745 --> 13:27.829
Turned off their GPS
to avoid detection.

13:27.872 --> 13:28.872
Happens all the time.

13:28.915 --> 13:30.115
Where was this?

13:32.752 --> 13:34.877
Right here...

13:34.921 --> 13:36.504
Appreciate it.

13:40.343 --> 13:42.093
Have you seen the footage?

13:42.137 --> 13:44.053
The riots in Estonia?
Yeah.

13:44.097 --> 13:46.556
Russia doesn't
need to push anymore.

13:46.599 --> 13:48.433
It's happening on its own now.

13:48.476 --> 13:50.101
What are you looking for?

13:50.145 --> 13:53.813
This...
World seismic activity chart.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.712
There. Fishing trawler
disappeared there,

13:57.736 --> 13:59.880
same time a small-scale
seismic event occurred.

13:59.904 --> 14:01.465
Not big enough
to be an earthquake,

14:01.489 --> 14:04.157
but still consistent
with the size, scope,

14:04.200 --> 14:06.178
and concussion of an explosion.

14:06.202 --> 14:08.369
You think somebody saw something
they shouldn't have?

14:08.413 --> 14:09.974
Yeah.
And paid the price for it.

14:09.998 --> 14:11.600
Task a satellite,
get me a visual.

14:11.624 --> 14:13.769
Otherwise, it's just one more
thing we can't prove.

14:13.793 --> 14:15.460
Russia has us
in a straightjacket.

14:15.503 --> 14:18.296
Let's just hope Jason Wolfe
has an open mind.

14:18.340 --> 14:19.964
Trust me, it's a distraction...

14:20.008 --> 14:22.925
No, it is an invasion.

14:22.969 --> 14:24.677
Straight
out of the Crimean playbook,

14:24.721 --> 14:27.138
step by step,
to take back Estonia.

14:27.182 --> 14:29.368
Everything you've got is
circumstantial, and you know it.

14:29.392 --> 14:31.829
It wasn't a fucking distraction
that beat the shit out of Daniel

14:31.853 --> 14:33.539
and tried to hunt us down
in Tallinn.

14:33.563 --> 14:36.022
Where the hell is Miller?
I'd like his take on this.

14:36.066 --> 14:37.815
He's out of contact
at the moment.

14:37.859 --> 14:39.525
But we expect
to hear from him soon.

14:39.569 --> 14:41.797
Listen, Jason,
I know how this sounds,

14:41.821 --> 14:43.632
but I also know that I'm right.

14:43.656 --> 14:45.718
The Kremlin wants nothing more
than to take back the Baltics.

14:45.742 --> 14:47.158
It's a point of pride.

14:47.202 --> 14:49.452
Well, Russia's broke
and war's expensive.

14:49.496 --> 14:52.663
Sure they gambled on the Crimea
and won, but now they have NATO.

14:52.707 --> 14:54.643
It's a different beast,
much bigger risk.

14:54.667 --> 14:57.293
Exactly.
And he's a risk taker.

14:57.337 --> 14:59.440
He's gambling that,
under this administration,

14:59.464 --> 15:01.047
America will back down

15:01.091 --> 15:03.841
and prove to the world that NATO
is just a paper tiger...

15:03.885 --> 15:06.219
All roar, no bite.

15:06.262 --> 15:09.514
You know what I'm gonna hear
if I take this up the chain?

15:09.557 --> 15:12.392
Why the hell are we defending
some Baltic shithole

15:12.435 --> 15:15.895
when America's facing threats
from Iran, ISIS, North Korea...

15:15.939 --> 15:17.980
The threat is just as real,
Jason.

15:18.024 --> 15:20.942
One Baltic state falls,
they all do.

15:20.985 --> 15:22.443
And then what?

15:22.487 --> 15:25.196
We got ourselves another
Iron Curtain? World War III?

15:25.240 --> 15:26.406
Come on now.

15:26.449 --> 15:27.635
I hear what you're saying,
Valerie,

15:27.659 --> 15:29.325
but not with this evidence.

15:29.369 --> 15:32.203
This is not a Russian invasion.
It's just a civil war.

15:32.247 --> 15:34.288
All right.

15:34.332 --> 15:35.581
All right, Jason.

15:35.625 --> 15:37.375
But when this happens,

15:37.419 --> 15:39.919
don't you dare call this
an intelligence failure.

15:39.963 --> 15:43.172
I filed my reports
and you have been warned.

15:43.216 --> 15:44.715
We'll speak very soon.

15:48.596 --> 15:53.015
Um, why didn't you call in
the cavalry for Daniel?

15:53.059 --> 15:55.101
And say what?

15:55.145 --> 15:57.164
That we don't know
whether he's missing or dead?

15:57.188 --> 15:58.521
Where are you going?

15:58.565 --> 16:01.232
Straight to
the fucking horse's mouth.

16:01.276 --> 16:03.317
Kolya?

16:03.361 --> 16:07.572
Seriously?
Well, we used to have
a good relationship

16:07.615 --> 16:11.075
back when we were in D.C.
Yeah, that was before
we accused him of being a spy

16:11.119 --> 16:12.805
and kicked him
out of the fucking country.

16:12.829 --> 16:16.080
Well, now he's the new head of
Russian intelligence.

16:16.124 --> 16:18.644
He always lands
on his feet.
Valerie, I'm telling you,

16:18.668 --> 16:21.961
you will not get a straight
answer out of that guy.

16:22.005 --> 16:24.213
I may not.

16:24.257 --> 16:25.756
We'll see.

17:50.176 --> 17:52.176
Goddamn Rafa Torres.

17:52.220 --> 17:53.886
How you doin'?

17:53.930 --> 17:55.741
When I heard
you were stationed in Tallinn,

17:55.765 --> 17:57.368
I thought it may be
a bit sleepy for you.

17:57.392 --> 17:59.495
Now here you come,
chased by armed Russians,

17:59.519 --> 18:01.394
jumping a corpse.

18:01.437 --> 18:03.707
You do know how to make
your own adventure, mate.

18:03.731 --> 18:06.315
What've you seen?
The usual.

18:06.359 --> 18:08.295
I spotted some lurkers in
our perimeter with night vision.

18:08.319 --> 18:10.444
The odd recon probe.

18:10.488 --> 18:12.007
We passed it all up the chain,

18:12.031 --> 18:13.384
but nothing really seemed
out of the ordinary

18:13.408 --> 18:15.344
until all hell broke loose
in Tallinn.

18:15.368 --> 18:19.078
Do you remember Sergei Basarov
from Syria?

18:19.122 --> 18:20.474
Doubtful I'll forget a sniper

18:20.498 --> 18:22.643
who picked off two of my men
from a mile out.

18:22.667 --> 18:26.085
He's here.
And 100 other Spetsnaz like him.

18:26.129 --> 18:28.254
Massing,
training ethnic Russians.

18:28.298 --> 18:30.464
You see them close up?
Too damn close.

18:30.508 --> 18:32.800
Jesus Christ.

18:32.844 --> 18:35.511
If this was a full on invasion,
how fast can you mobilize?

18:35.555 --> 18:37.575
Well, we'd hold them off
until reinforcements arrived.

18:37.599 --> 18:39.932
And if cavalry can't
or won't arrive?

18:39.976 --> 18:42.246
Bloody hell,
we're just a tripwire force.

18:42.270 --> 18:45.688
We'd take our pound of flesh...
but we'd last 48 hours, max.

18:58.953 --> 19:00.786
Voilà.

19:00.830 --> 19:02.330
Ah.

19:07.170 --> 19:11.756
You know, I'm told these boots
belonged to Will Rogers.

19:11.799 --> 19:14.592
I don't know who that is.

19:14.636 --> 19:18.763
Will Rogers was a great man.

19:18.806 --> 19:23.851
Movie star, political wit,
philosopher, cowboy.

19:23.895 --> 19:26.979
You know, there's a park named
after him in California.

19:27.023 --> 19:29.940
And are those really his boots?

19:29.984 --> 19:32.943
Who knows?
Russian black market.

19:32.987 --> 19:35.655
But, as a wise man said,

19:35.698 --> 19:39.033
"When the legend becomes fact,
print the legend."

19:40.912 --> 19:45.665
You know, "The Man Who Shot
Liberty Valance."

19:45.708 --> 19:49.794
I'm sorry.
I don't watch the news.

19:49.837 --> 19:54.423
So, is it just boots today?

19:54.467 --> 19:57.134
It's never just boots.

19:57.178 --> 19:59.261
Where are we with surveillance?

19:59.305 --> 20:01.972
The flat is
bugged, wired, all set.

20:02.016 --> 20:03.808
Good.

20:03.851 --> 20:07.144
Good.

20:07.188 --> 20:10.523
Does it ever bother you,
working both sides?

20:10.566 --> 20:14.151
As far as I'm concerned,
you're all full of shit.

20:14.195 --> 20:16.340
The only thing real
is the money.

20:16.364 --> 20:20.825
Ah. The last honest man
in Berlin, huh?

20:20.868 --> 20:25.955
So, how do I look?

20:25.998 --> 20:27.998
<i>Shchegolevatyy.</i>

20:28.042 --> 20:30.418
Mm. Dapper.

20:30.461 --> 20:34.964
Yes, this was the look
I was going for.

20:35.007 --> 20:38.759
And where are you going
dressed so well?

20:38.803 --> 20:41.512
I have a date
with a beautiful American.

20:41.556 --> 20:43.973
Uh-huh.

20:58.406 --> 21:00.865
Valerie Edwards.

21:00.908 --> 21:02.616
How long has it been?

21:02.660 --> 21:03.993
Too long, Kolya.

21:04.036 --> 21:06.620
You look well.

21:06.664 --> 21:09.206
Seems you've landed on your feet
since leaving the U.S.

21:09.250 --> 21:14.336
How nice of you not to say
"forcibly expelled."

21:14.380 --> 21:16.130
I'm sure it was all

21:16.174 --> 21:18.152
a big diplomatic
misunderstanding.

21:18.176 --> 21:21.427
I remember
the first time I saw you

21:21.471 --> 21:24.013
at the State Department party.

21:24.056 --> 21:27.475
I thought, this
is a real American woman.

21:27.518 --> 21:31.437
Amelia Earhart's spirit
with Audrey Hepburn's class.

21:31.481 --> 21:34.732
Clearly you've lost
none of your charm, Kolya.

21:34.776 --> 21:38.611
Wouldn't it be nice to be
on the same side for once?

21:38.654 --> 21:40.905
Perhaps we can be.

21:40.948 --> 21:42.948
How can I help?

21:42.992 --> 21:46.118
Well, you could tell me why your
government is invading Estonia.

21:49.248 --> 21:52.666
Valerie, my dear,

21:52.710 --> 21:57.379
what is happening in Estonia
is tragic.

21:57.423 --> 22:01.634
But it's a civil war,
not a Russian invasion.

22:01.677 --> 22:05.763
Kolya, I have heaps of evidence
that point towards Russia.

22:05.807 --> 22:08.285
You're a moderate.
This can't sit well with you.

22:08.309 --> 22:11.143
Why don't you help me stop it
before it goes any further?

22:11.187 --> 22:15.105
I am assuming
you are coming to me

22:15.149 --> 22:18.442
because you can't get your own
administration to believe you.

22:18.486 --> 22:22.238
I'm coming to you because
I have always admired
your intelligence.

22:22.281 --> 22:24.907
Considering your own government

22:24.951 --> 22:27.827
made it very clear
I'm not to be trusted,

22:27.870 --> 22:30.287
why would I tell you anything?

22:30.331 --> 22:33.415
Because if Russia is drawn
into a long and costly war

22:33.459 --> 22:36.126
in the Baltics, it could very
well destroy your country.

22:36.170 --> 22:38.045
Mm. Yes...

22:38.089 --> 22:42.091
Or bring her greater glory.

22:42.134 --> 22:45.302
History is so annoyingly
unpredictable

22:45.346 --> 22:48.097
until you live it.

22:48.140 --> 22:51.578
You know, Robert Kirsch
said I wouldn't get a
straight answer out of you.

22:51.602 --> 22:54.562
But I said
you're an honorable man.

22:54.605 --> 22:56.480
Which is it?

22:56.524 --> 22:59.441
Valerie,

22:59.485 --> 23:01.986
I'm telling you, honestly,

23:02.029 --> 23:03.821
the Russian government

23:03.865 --> 23:07.408
is not behind
what's happening in Estonia.

23:10.496 --> 23:11.787
Then who is?

23:11.831 --> 23:14.123
Let me look into it,

23:14.166 --> 23:15.666
see what I can find.

23:15.710 --> 23:18.669
Thank you.

23:20.172 --> 23:23.215
And next time it's dinner, huh?

23:23.259 --> 23:25.320
Well, if you don't help me
stop this thing,

23:25.344 --> 23:27.744
there's not gonna be
a next time.

23:38.065 --> 23:39.523
Hello?

23:39.567 --> 23:41.692
Hi. This is Esther.

23:41.736 --> 23:43.881
I need to know
if you've heard from Daniel.

23:43.905 --> 23:47.072
Shit.

23:47.116 --> 23:48.699
Are you still there?

23:48.743 --> 23:50.326
Yes, Esther, I'm here.

23:50.369 --> 23:51.847
I'm just running into a meeting.

23:51.871 --> 23:53.390
We expect to hear back from him.

23:53.414 --> 23:55.539
I'll let you know
as soon as we do.

23:55.583 --> 23:57.041
Okay.

24:14.685 --> 24:16.914
Much appreciated.
I'll be in touch.

24:16.938 --> 24:18.562
We'll be here.

24:18.606 --> 24:20.356
You're not alone in this.

24:20.399 --> 24:24.068
My tribe, we don't stop.

24:26.072 --> 24:28.656
Thank you.

24:30.409 --> 24:32.554
You're on a secure channel
with me and Robert.

24:32.578 --> 24:34.870
Why the fuck didn't you check in
before now?

24:34.914 --> 24:38.040
I was busy getting chased
through fucking Estonia

24:38.084 --> 24:39.667
by Little Green Men.

24:39.710 --> 24:42.920
Miller was right,
they're armed to the teeth.

24:42.964 --> 24:44.046
Where are you?

24:44.090 --> 24:46.298
I'm leaving the NATO base
in Tapa.

24:46.342 --> 24:49.134
I'm going to the U.S. Army
hospital in Frankfurt.

24:49.178 --> 24:51.448
Wait, what?
Why are you flying to Frankfurt?

24:51.472 --> 24:53.097
Are you... Are you hurt?

24:53.140 --> 24:56.558
Well, no exactly.

24:56.602 --> 24:58.288
You took the body, didn't you?

24:58.312 --> 25:01.230
I did. I'll take whatever flack
comes my way.

25:03.859 --> 25:04.984
Thank you.

25:05.027 --> 25:06.610
I got to go.

25:06.654 --> 25:08.112
I'll check in when I land.

25:12.201 --> 25:15.119
Before you say anything,

25:15.162 --> 25:18.455
I couldn't bear to
think of Daniel in that field

25:18.499 --> 25:20.124
any more than you could.

25:20.167 --> 25:22.501
No argument here.

25:22.545 --> 25:24.856
I just don't want Torres
going rogue.

25:24.880 --> 25:26.797
Absolutely.

25:26.841 --> 25:28.652
Which is why I think
you should go to Frankfurt

25:28.676 --> 25:31.927
and meet with him.
Done.

25:31.971 --> 25:35.139
Uh...

25:35.182 --> 25:37.474
How'd it go with Kolya?

25:37.518 --> 25:39.518
He says it's not Russia.

25:39.562 --> 25:42.604
Yeah, I knew
he wouldn't come clean.

25:42.648 --> 25:45.048
No, I think
he's telling the truth.

26:04.962 --> 26:08.547
Oh, lucky me. Herr Dorn.

26:08.591 --> 26:12.176
Ah, Mila, always a delight
to see you as well.

26:13.929 --> 26:17.222
I have been listening
to your podcast.

26:17.266 --> 26:22.061
Maybe you are not
as entertaining as you think...

26:22.104 --> 26:23.999
And yet you keep on listening.

26:24.023 --> 26:26.565
But my shows are in reruns.

26:26.609 --> 26:29.318
You want the liver
or the sweetbread?

26:29.361 --> 26:32.362
Today feels like
knuckle of pork.

26:32.406 --> 26:35.157
Okay.
The knuckle of pork.

26:39.705 --> 26:44.416
Please, join me
if you're so inclined.

26:44.460 --> 26:46.855
Never sit facing away
from the door

26:46.879 --> 26:50.756
unless you have eyes
in the back of your head.

26:50.800 --> 26:52.674
Heh.

26:52.718 --> 26:56.595
Yes, yes, old mobster wisdom.

26:58.849 --> 27:01.975
I'll have
what Mr. Dorn is having.

27:07.775 --> 27:09.566
Forgive my boldness.

27:09.610 --> 27:13.070
I heard your voice
and, um, I'm an admirer.

27:15.449 --> 27:16.990
Of course,

27:17.034 --> 27:20.452
a fan.

27:20.496 --> 27:23.914
Let's be really bold
and tell each other the truth,

27:23.958 --> 27:26.208
shall we, Fraulein Krug?

27:28.170 --> 27:31.380
Why don't we start again,
Mr. Dorn?

27:31.423 --> 27:33.757
Oh, please.
Do call me Gil.

27:33.801 --> 27:36.760
Well, Gil, I'm a history buff.

27:36.804 --> 27:38.887
How fortunate.

27:38.931 --> 27:40.472
I am history.

27:40.516 --> 27:41.807
Indeed you are.

27:41.851 --> 27:44.268
Your podcast about
Henrik Viiding's

27:44.311 --> 27:46.979
escape from East Berlin
really sparked something.

27:47.022 --> 27:49.982
The imagery of all those files
going up in flames,

27:50.025 --> 27:52.609
secrets destroyed,
lost to prying eyes...

27:52.653 --> 27:54.653
that was really something.

27:54.697 --> 27:57.781
I'm chuffed that I could be
an inspiration to you.

27:57.825 --> 28:00.534
I think Viiding
wasn't the only one

28:00.578 --> 28:02.870
who escaped the Stasi
that night.

28:02.913 --> 28:04.288
I think you did too.

28:04.331 --> 28:07.624
Me?

28:07.668 --> 28:10.063
No, I'm just an old spook
telling stories.

28:10.087 --> 28:13.797
Well...
I'm a captive audience.

28:35.446 --> 28:38.655
Another Baltic Strong account.

28:44.246 --> 28:48.957
See, no personal information,
just attacks against me.

28:49.001 --> 28:50.792
The Baltic Strong page

28:50.836 --> 28:55.214
only went live a few days before
my Sama Kaart was announced.

28:55.257 --> 28:58.300
It's all fake.

28:58.344 --> 29:00.719
Internet's down.

29:00.763 --> 29:02.179
Shit.

29:02.223 --> 29:05.349
Uh, looks like
we might've been hacked.

29:05.392 --> 29:08.644
Mm-hmm. You have.

29:08.687 --> 29:10.646
By me.

29:14.193 --> 29:16.109
Valerie, what's going on?

29:16.153 --> 29:19.154
Why don't you ask Sofia?

29:25.079 --> 29:28.247
When were you gonna tell us that
you hacked for the Russians?

29:28.290 --> 29:31.917
What?
That's crazy...

29:31.961 --> 29:34.169
No. It's not.

29:34.213 --> 29:37.130
What do you mean?

29:37.174 --> 29:40.133
She's telling the truth.

29:40.177 --> 29:41.593
It's a long story.

29:41.637 --> 29:44.346
I'd start now.

29:46.809 --> 29:51.436
I was a kid, 17.

29:51.480 --> 29:53.105
My mother had just died.

29:53.148 --> 29:54.898
She was Estonian,
my father was Russian.

29:54.942 --> 29:59.695
So I was a mutt,
unwanted on both sides.

29:59.738 --> 30:03.615
I hated pretty much everything
about me that was Estonian.

30:03.659 --> 30:06.076
I was angry.

30:06.120 --> 30:09.454
Anyway, um, I found friends,

30:09.498 --> 30:13.583
a community of hackers,
Russians, who welcomed me.

30:13.627 --> 30:16.336
The Soviet propaganda machine
is 100 years old

30:16.380 --> 30:18.046
and I was an easy prey, yes.

30:18.090 --> 30:20.132
I'm not proud of it,
but it happened.

30:20.175 --> 30:24.678
My time hacking actually led me
to create my Sama Kaart program.

30:24.722 --> 30:27.264
Unity instead of division.

30:30.936 --> 30:34.646
You don't need to believe me,
but it is the truth.

30:36.400 --> 30:38.840
Can I speak with you
for a moment?

30:45.159 --> 30:46.469
I think we should trust her.

30:46.493 --> 30:48.535
She lied to us, April.

30:48.579 --> 30:50.162
Now, this was my mistake.

30:50.205 --> 30:53.123
Because of the urgency of
the situation and her skill set,

30:53.167 --> 30:54.541
I fast-tracked her exfil.

30:54.585 --> 30:56.084
I thought she could help us.

30:56.128 --> 30:57.968
She <i> is</i> helping us.
At what risk?

30:58.005 --> 30:59.838
Had I known,
I never would've given her

30:59.882 --> 31:01.631
this kind of access
in a safe house.

31:01.675 --> 31:03.820
We're just getting
so close to proving it's Russia.

31:03.844 --> 31:06.004
What if she's just leading us
where she wants us to go?

31:08.015 --> 31:10.640
With all due respect,
I don't believe that.

31:10.684 --> 31:12.768
I understand that you like her.

31:12.811 --> 31:14.164
Could you give me
a little bit more credit?

31:14.188 --> 31:15.832
I'm just looking at the facts.

31:15.856 --> 31:18.648
Her best friend was killed,
her name was destroyed,

31:18.692 --> 31:21.004
she's not even safe
in her own country.

31:21.028 --> 31:23.173
It doesn't make sense
that she's in on it.

31:23.197 --> 31:25.030
Well, I hope you're right.

31:25.074 --> 31:26.198
But I'm still vetting her.

31:26.241 --> 31:27.552
And I'm doing it right
this time.

31:27.576 --> 31:29.493
We'll continue to protect her,

31:29.536 --> 31:32.120
but as of now,
Sofia is off the grid.

31:32.164 --> 31:33.246
What?

31:33.290 --> 31:34.623
Dove wants to meet.

31:34.666 --> 31:36.958
Go. You're not needed here
any longer.

31:37.002 --> 31:39.795
Dove's your priority.

31:39.838 --> 31:41.630
Oh...

31:41.673 --> 31:43.840
Oh, what could you say?

31:43.884 --> 31:46.802
They just don't make spooks
the way they used to.

31:46.845 --> 31:47.969
Yeah.

31:48.013 --> 31:50.764
Spies like Diver?

31:50.808 --> 31:55.185
Changing the course of history
in a single night...

31:55.229 --> 31:57.646
Exactly.

31:57.689 --> 31:59.314
If not for Diver,

31:59.358 --> 32:02.567
the Stasi would've killed
Henrik Viiding 30 years ago

32:02.611 --> 32:05.612
and Estonia might never
have gained its independence.

32:05.656 --> 32:09.741
I think
that hint of hero worship

32:09.785 --> 32:11.827
hides a darker truth.

32:11.870 --> 32:14.621
Please do, yes, let's...

32:14.665 --> 32:20.585
Tell me about your dark truths,
Fraulein Krug...

32:20.629 --> 32:22.379
I think you're Diver.

32:30.180 --> 32:34.391
Oh, my dear woman...

32:34.435 --> 32:36.788
Let's talk about something else,
shall we?

32:36.812 --> 32:39.479
Of course.

32:39.523 --> 32:43.692
I've always wondered, in the
years before the Wall fell,

32:43.735 --> 32:46.653
a number of Stasi agents
were exposed.

32:46.697 --> 32:50.365
Some, like Lucas Beker,
were executed.

32:50.409 --> 32:52.554
They thought they found the
double-agent who betrayed them,

32:52.578 --> 32:56.288
but looking back,
the timelines don't match.

32:56.331 --> 33:01.293
I've always wondered if, uh,
if there was someone else...

33:01.336 --> 33:02.919
perhaps Diver.

33:02.963 --> 33:06.089
Diver only ever did his job.

33:06.133 --> 33:08.133
So, you do know him.

33:09.970 --> 33:12.053
There's nothing to know.

33:12.097 --> 33:14.639
He was a spook.

33:14.683 --> 33:16.308
Haven't you heard?

33:16.351 --> 33:17.934
We never existed.

33:17.978 --> 33:19.019
I know...

33:21.023 --> 33:26.651
A spy is a spy is a spy.

33:26.695 --> 33:28.904
Even the beautiful ones.

33:28.947 --> 33:32.741
Forgive my boldness, Fraulein,

33:32.784 --> 33:35.243
but...

33:35.287 --> 33:37.412
fuck off.

33:51.428 --> 33:54.638
Okay, there's not enough
ketchup in the world

33:54.681 --> 33:56.493
to save these fries.
I told you
they were wretched.

33:56.517 --> 33:58.808
No, I thought that
you were exaggerating.

33:58.852 --> 34:00.852
You kinda underplayed it.

34:00.896 --> 34:03.730
So, you want to tell me
about last night?

34:03.774 --> 34:07.817
Big guy who walked up
and started whaling on you?

34:07.861 --> 34:09.047
A misunderstanding.

34:09.071 --> 34:10.507
And this is not as bad
as it looks.

34:10.531 --> 34:12.072
I was there.

34:12.114 --> 34:14.991
I had to drag your skinny ass
up three flights of stairs.

34:18.413 --> 34:22.123
Well, the upside is, I at least
got to see your dad's lab.

34:22.167 --> 34:25.835
What was that Star Trek-looking
thing in the case?

34:30.050 --> 34:32.717
It's probably easier to show you
than explain.

34:36.014 --> 34:39.306
Remote-focused ultrasound.

34:39.351 --> 34:41.518
It concentrates
high-intensity sound waves

34:41.562 --> 34:44.145
and focuses them
on specific areas of the body.

34:44.188 --> 34:46.481
Like a laser?

34:46.525 --> 34:49.192
Same idea, but sound, not light.

34:52.030 --> 34:55.657
It can target anything from
cancerous tumors to Parkinson's.

34:55.701 --> 34:58.618
My dad's a genius, but he never
thinks about marketing.

34:58.662 --> 35:01.079
I made a presentation
to sell it a while back.

35:01.123 --> 35:03.582
Want to see?
I'd love to.

35:14.886 --> 35:18.972
<i>Imagine a world where</i>
tradition <i> surgery is obsolete.</i>

35:19.016 --> 35:23.435
<i>No incisions, no sutures,
lower risk, quicker recovery...</i>

35:23.478 --> 35:25.770
<i>With a base-line success rate
in clinical trials</i>

35:25.814 --> 35:27.856
<i>higher than 90%.</i>

35:27.899 --> 35:30.358
<i>Soon you won't have
to imagine this world,</i>

35:30.402 --> 35:31.776
<i>you'll be living in it.</i>

35:31.820 --> 35:33.862
<i>Dr. Kyoti Adeyemi's
remote-focus</i>

35:33.905 --> 35:36.698
<i>ultrasound pen represents...</i>
What am I looking at?

35:36.742 --> 35:38.845
Keeping watching
and imagine the possibilities.

35:38.869 --> 35:41.411
<i>...a game changing moment
in history.</i>

35:41.455 --> 35:44.205
<i>Wait lists for life-saving
operations often stretch</i>

35:44.249 --> 35:45.415
<i>from months to years.</i>

35:45.459 --> 35:46.791
<i>That delay is...</i>

35:46.835 --> 35:50.378
So, it's some sort
of supersonic medtech?

35:50.422 --> 35:53.298
Adeyemi can focus sound waves
on a problem area

35:53.342 --> 35:54.986
without destroying
the surrounding tissue.

35:55.010 --> 35:56.426
He's fine-tuning it now.

35:56.470 --> 35:58.637
Completely non-invasive
surgery...

35:58.680 --> 36:00.658
I know you can't read me in
all the way

36:00.682 --> 36:02.619
on why the CIA
wants this tech...

36:02.643 --> 36:04.768
Off the record,
with do want this technology

36:04.811 --> 36:06.436
for its medical applications.

36:06.480 --> 36:08.521
The U.S. has been losing out
on far too much

36:08.565 --> 36:10.357
intellectual property
to the Chinese.

36:10.400 --> 36:13.193
Sound waves leave no trace.

36:13.236 --> 36:15.173
In the wrong hands,
this could be a weapon.

36:15.197 --> 36:16.529
Our job is to secure it.

36:16.573 --> 36:18.217
We need to make sure
that we are the first ones

36:18.241 --> 36:20.075
through that door.

36:22.496 --> 36:26.122
Any word on the autopsy?

36:26.166 --> 36:28.917
Uh, we should know soon.
Yeah.

36:34.341 --> 36:36.966
Major Jacobs, Control Room 5.

36:37.010 --> 36:44.307
<i>Major Jacobs,
Control Room 5 please.</i>

36:47.187 --> 36:51.481
Look, she sent a minder.

36:51.525 --> 36:53.002
Yeah.
Yeah, she did.

36:53.026 --> 36:55.694
In what fucking world
would she not?

36:55.737 --> 36:56.839
So, what's the deal here?
Where's...

36:56.863 --> 36:58.822
Pathologist has the body.

36:58.865 --> 37:01.282
It might take some time.

37:01.326 --> 37:03.868
Look.

37:03.912 --> 37:06.162
I got some vacation photos
for ya.

37:12.254 --> 37:14.546
Fuck me.
Mm-hmm.

37:14.589 --> 37:16.317
This might be the last thing
that Daniel saw

37:16.341 --> 37:18.007
before they got him.

37:21.930 --> 37:26.141
Hey, listen to me,
this in no way diminishes

37:26.184 --> 37:28.079
my opinion of you as a nutjob,

37:28.103 --> 37:29.997
but thank you
for bringing him back.

37:30.021 --> 37:33.857
It, uh, means a lot.

37:33.900 --> 37:36.151
You're welcome.

37:36.194 --> 37:38.903
Be careful,
you might start liking me.

37:38.947 --> 37:42.282
Fuck off.

37:42.325 --> 37:46.286
Weird thing,
the weapons are a hodgpodge,

37:46.329 --> 37:50.415
Israeli, Belgian, Chinese.

37:50.459 --> 37:52.333
You name it, they got it.

37:52.377 --> 37:55.336
But the Russian army only uses
standard-issue weaponry, right?

37:55.380 --> 37:57.172
Last time I checked.

37:57.215 --> 37:59.674
But look at this.

37:59.718 --> 38:01.968
A hundred Spetsnaz.
Jesus Christ.

38:02.012 --> 38:04.429
And my shadow.
In the flesh.

38:04.473 --> 38:07.807
Sergei Basarov.

38:07.851 --> 38:11.102
This is proof of Russian boots
on the ground.

38:11.146 --> 38:13.313
The Kremlin can say
that it was ex-Spetsnaz,

38:13.356 --> 38:15.148
hired mercenaries...

38:15.192 --> 38:20.153
Yeah, but working for who?

38:20.197 --> 38:22.322
There's a tail
they want us to chase.

38:28.288 --> 38:31.623
<i>Was that Sofia Vesik
file a mind fuck?</i>

38:31.666 --> 38:35.627
I wanted you
to be fully informed.

38:35.670 --> 38:39.297
<i>Well, then you need to be
completely honest with me.</i>

38:39.341 --> 38:40.590
Scout's honor.

38:40.634 --> 38:42.801
So you're sticking
to your story?

38:42.844 --> 38:44.803
The Russian government
has absolutely nothing

38:44.846 --> 38:46.805
to do with what's happening
in Estonia?

38:46.848 --> 38:49.891
I assure you they do not.

38:49.935 --> 38:53.311
But it's not to say
that they wouldn't be pleased

38:53.355 --> 38:57.982
<i>if these dominos
continues to fall.</i>

38:58.026 --> 38:59.484
<i>Good night, my dear.</i>

39:15.502 --> 39:17.502
Romy's at the movies
with a new friend.

39:17.546 --> 39:20.672
Some Pixar flick, dubbed in
German with French subtitles.

39:20.715 --> 39:22.841
I figure maybe she'll come out
of it trilingual.

39:22.884 --> 39:26.803
Cheaper than lessons.

39:26.847 --> 39:29.889
Her new friend
is Elvis reincarnated

39:29.933 --> 39:32.253
as a purple unicorn on acid.

39:34.521 --> 39:36.896
Piss off.
I'm listening...

39:36.940 --> 39:39.649
Honestly, I'm surprised you were
able to pull yourself away.

39:39.693 --> 39:42.253
It's actually quite nice to
speak to somebody who's not...

39:43.864 --> 39:45.655
Well, I'm not.

39:45.699 --> 39:46.990
I'm your friend.

39:47.033 --> 39:50.285
You know, I remember when you

39:50.328 --> 39:53.788
were thrashing around
in a Mudhoney mosh pit

39:53.832 --> 39:56.124
in a torn "Fuck Bush" t-shirt.

39:58.378 --> 40:02.463
I remember that show.

40:02.507 --> 40:05.008
Yeah...

40:07.053 --> 40:09.679
You know, I never understood
why you went into the CIA.

40:09.723 --> 40:13.349
It's the last thing I thought
someone like you would ever do.

40:13.393 --> 40:17.395
When 9/11 happened I understood
a little better. But...

40:17.439 --> 40:20.982
Over the years I've seen
this job start to eat you up.

40:21.026 --> 40:24.861
Look, this case is just hitting
a little close to home.

40:24.905 --> 40:28.364
Those photos that you saw this
morning of that burnt corpse

40:28.408 --> 40:29.510
may be a friend of mine.

40:29.534 --> 40:31.451
Oh, God.

40:31.494 --> 40:34.162
And if it is him,
then that means

40:34.205 --> 40:37.123
that I may be burying
a very good man

40:37.167 --> 40:39.020
that died under my directive.

40:39.044 --> 40:40.627
And if it's not?

40:40.670 --> 40:42.148
Well, then I have
to make a decision.

40:42.172 --> 40:45.798
Whether I use my limited
resources to save him,

40:45.842 --> 40:47.967
or to prevent a war.

40:48.011 --> 40:51.971
Jesus, how is that fair?

40:52.015 --> 40:53.723
It's not.

41:09.324 --> 41:11.010
Man, can you just stop that?

41:11.034 --> 41:13.868
It's... it's like watching
a deranged wind-up toy, man.

41:13.912 --> 41:16.537
No, actually I can't.

41:16.581 --> 41:19.101
Well, it's just wearing, like,
a Kirsch-shaped hole

41:19.125 --> 41:21.793
into the ground.

41:24.589 --> 41:26.798
Hey. Hey.

41:29.970 --> 41:33.638
Did you get the photos I sent?
Weapons, the Russian irregulars?

41:33.682 --> 41:38.226
I did.
Well, there's your proof, right?
Boots on the ground?

41:38.269 --> 41:42.313
It's still not definitive enough
to take to the Oval.

41:42.357 --> 41:46.401
Well, Jason, it won't be... until
it's too late.

41:46.444 --> 41:49.487
Henrik was poisoned,
Sofia Vesik was a victim

41:49.531 --> 41:53.574
of a coordinated cyber-attack,
the civil war is a fucking sham.

41:53.618 --> 41:55.888
This is happening.
We need to stop it.

41:55.912 --> 42:01.457
You know, they say 9/11
was a failure of imagination.

42:01.501 --> 42:03.312
You don't want to be the man
who could've stopped

42:03.336 --> 42:07.588
<i>a world war and didn't, do you?</i>

42:07.632 --> 42:10.133
All right, Valerie,
you made your point.

42:10.176 --> 42:12.427
I'll send somebody.

42:18.059 --> 42:21.144
If she's right,
there's no good outcome.

42:21.187 --> 42:23.271
We back our promise to NATO,
we'll be stuck in some

42:23.314 --> 42:24.981
bloody intractable land war.

42:25.025 --> 42:27.108
Maybe even nuclear.

42:27.152 --> 42:30.611
So... who the fuck do we send
to that shit show?

42:30.655 --> 42:34.115
It might be a good idea
to go outside the Company.

42:34.159 --> 42:36.784
Well, we'll need somebody
who's familiar with the CIA,

42:36.828 --> 42:38.453
who has
the administration's ear,

42:38.496 --> 42:39.620
who knows diplomacy...

42:39.664 --> 42:41.017
And someone who will wear it

42:41.041 --> 42:43.019
if it all goes to hell
with the Russians?

42:43.043 --> 42:44.417
Yeah.

42:55.972 --> 42:58.139
Get me BB Yates.

42:58.183 --> 43:00.725
Look, I know it's hard
being cut off.

43:00.769 --> 43:01.976
It's not about me.

43:02.020 --> 43:04.645
I have 200 employees
and a have a country

43:04.689 --> 43:07.023
soaking up fake news,
and I can't fight it

43:07.067 --> 43:08.775
locked inside a cage.

43:08.818 --> 43:11.130
If Valerie says we need
to vet you, we need to vet you.

43:11.154 --> 43:12.945
And how long will that take?

43:12.989 --> 43:15.281
I don't know.

43:15.325 --> 43:18.242
Do you believe me about hacking?

43:18.286 --> 43:22.288
Yes.
I was an angry teen myself.

43:22.332 --> 43:24.685
My dad was killed in Iraq
when I was in high school.

43:24.709 --> 43:27.251
I'm sorry.
I was like you.

43:27.295 --> 43:31.339
I don't think anybody expected
much of me, including myself.

43:31.382 --> 43:33.486
One day I saw the toll
it was taking on my mother,

43:33.510 --> 43:35.780
and I knew I needed
to do better.

43:35.804 --> 43:38.387
So I got my grades up
and I chose a career

43:38.431 --> 43:41.516
that challenged me,
where I could do good.

43:41.559 --> 43:43.017
It's naive, but...

43:43.061 --> 43:46.354
No, it sounds like you grew up.

43:46.397 --> 43:48.439
Yeah.

43:48.483 --> 43:50.191
I'm starving.

43:50.235 --> 43:52.235
Food looks nice.
Want something?

43:52.278 --> 43:54.638
No, I'm good.
But I'll get it.

43:58.493 --> 44:00.893
There's nowhere for you to run.

44:04.624 --> 44:06.833
I'll take a salad.
Good.

44:26.855 --> 44:28.771
I got to call you back.

45:43.181 --> 45:45.681
<i>Valerie, we got confirmation.</i>

45:48.186 --> 45:49.852
It's not Daniel.

45:56.569 --> 45:58.069
Thank God.

45:58.112 --> 46:00.029
<i>So, who is it?</i>

46:00.073 --> 46:01.530
No idea.

46:01.574 --> 46:04.094
Guy had shrapnel wounds
and a reconstructed knee

46:04.118 --> 46:06.013
with a ceramic made
only in Russia.

46:06.037 --> 46:07.662
These prosthetics are not cheap.

46:07.705 --> 46:09.789
This guy was taken care of.

46:09.832 --> 46:10.998
Spetsnaz.

46:11.042 --> 46:12.541
<i>Most likely.</i>

46:12.585 --> 46:14.961
So, where the fuck is Daniel?

46:15.004 --> 46:17.483
Well, if they really killed him,
they would've left him there.

46:17.507 --> 46:18.943
It makes sense
they'd take him alive.

46:18.967 --> 46:21.237
100%.
It's bargaining power.

46:21.261 --> 46:23.219
There's something else.

46:23.263 --> 46:25.554
It might not
be the Russian government.

46:25.598 --> 46:27.723
Weapons don't follow
the tradition army

46:27.767 --> 46:29.100
or state sponsors.

46:29.143 --> 46:30.829
<i>It could be one
of the oligarchs.</i>

46:30.853 --> 46:32.331
They're certainly
in a position to finance

46:32.355 --> 46:33.813
an operation like that.

46:33.856 --> 46:35.584
Well, if that's the case,
then I'm assuming

46:35.608 --> 46:38.359
that this oligarch has the tacit
approval of the Kremlin.

46:38.403 --> 46:40.236
Kolya hinted as much.

46:40.280 --> 46:41.882
Independent players
can be just as deadly.

46:41.906 --> 46:43.175
Look at bin Laden.
<i>Right.</i>

46:43.199 --> 46:45.741
<i>So it's a contest...</i>

46:45.785 --> 46:48.097
<i>Who can bring the biggest
head on a stick.</i>

46:48.121 --> 46:51.580
Well, the Baltics would be
a very, very big head.

46:51.624 --> 46:53.727
If they succeed,
they win the Kremlin's favor.

46:53.751 --> 46:56.460
And if they fail,
Moscow gets to pretend

46:56.504 --> 46:57.815
that they never even knew
anything was happening.

46:57.839 --> 46:59.297
It's a win-win for him.

46:59.340 --> 47:01.151
Yeah, but there must be dozens
of billionaire

47:01.175 --> 47:02.508
oligarchs out there.

47:02.552 --> 47:04.697
Wha... Where do we start?
How do we narrow?

47:04.721 --> 47:08.264
Follow the weapons.
These guys had everything.

47:08.308 --> 47:11.851
They had Belgian FN SCAR,
Israeli Galil ACE,

47:11.894 --> 47:14.645
CNPMIEC HN-6 from China.

47:14.689 --> 47:16.981
<i>There's only one guy
who sells all these models,</i>

47:17.025 --> 47:18.691
<i>one-stop shopping.</i>

47:18.735 --> 47:20.359
Birdman.

47:20.403 --> 47:22.778
If anyone anyone knows
who the players are in Estonia,

47:22.822 --> 47:23.988
it's this guy.

47:24.032 --> 47:25.156
He lives in Vienna.

47:25.199 --> 47:26.782
Former weapons inspector.

47:26.826 --> 47:29.327
Turned around
and started selling.

47:29.370 --> 47:31.746
He's a fucking
piece of work, man.

47:31.789 --> 47:34.790
I shutter to think what
that means coming from you.

47:34.834 --> 47:37.460
<i>It means you're both on
the next flight to Vienna.</i>

47:37.503 --> 47:39.962
Find Birdman.
Get him to talk.

47:40.006 --> 47:41.525
We're gonna stop this invasion,
but we're gonna

47:41.549 --> 47:44.133
find Daniel, first.
That is our number-one priority.

47:44.177 --> 47:46.030
<i>Planting Daniel's ID
on the body,</i>

47:46.054 --> 47:48.614
that kept us running around
and asking questions,

47:48.639 --> 47:50.326
but did it really buy
them that much time?

47:50.350 --> 47:52.119
No, they bought all the time
they needed.

47:52.143 --> 47:55.311
The attack is already on,
isn't it?
