00:01.929 --> 00:03.089
Previously on Angel:

00:03.729 --> 00:05.830
How about gracing us
with a number?

00:06.129 --> 00:07.849
The Host.
He helps demons.

00:08.529 --> 00:09.970
Reads their souls.

00:10.330 --> 00:12.289
Only when they sing karaoke.

00:13.330 --> 00:14.560
Darla. That's her.

00:14.529 --> 00:16.850
You're what Wolfram & Hart
brought back.

00:17.530 --> 00:20.089
- I remember everything.
- You have a soul now.

00:20.530 --> 00:23.719
Soon those memories are gonna
start eating away at you.

00:24.730 --> 00:26.760
What did you do? What am I?

00:27.129 --> 00:29.760
You allowed her to escape,
you facilitated it.

00:30.129 --> 00:32.299
- She needed help.
- You know what she was.

00:33.130 --> 00:33.759
What we were.

00:33.729 --> 00:36.820
Turn me back. I can't bear
this pounding in my chest!

00:37.929 --> 00:39.009
I can't.

00:39.729 --> 00:41.130
- Darla, wait.
- No.

00:41.530 --> 00:43.390
Don't look for me again.

00:50.530 --> 00:52.850
Don't you think we should
check on him?

00:54.130 --> 00:56.549
He's been in that cellar a long time.

00:57.130 --> 01:00.250
I keep hearing a "chucka-chucka" sound.

01:01.329 --> 01:03.579
- What's he doing?
- How should I know?

01:03.729 --> 01:07.099
He barely says "Good morning,
and get me a glass of blood."

01:07.930 --> 01:09.719
He's so distraught about--

01:10.329 --> 01:13.769
Don't say Darla. I'm sick and
tired of hearing about her.

01:14.530 --> 01:16.920
If I hear the name
Darla one more time--

01:17.530 --> 01:20.370
He's not distraught,
he's obsessed. I thought...

01:21.129 --> 01:23.060
...you'd be a man and talk to him.

01:23.530 --> 01:26.579
I was a man. I said...things.

01:27.129 --> 01:29.129
- Like what?
- Like...

01:29.530 --> 01:32.269
...did he prefer milk
or sugar in his tea?

01:33.129 --> 01:34.879
- It's how men talk in England.
- Shh!

01:35.530 --> 01:37.000
Listen. It stopped.

01:37.329 --> 01:38.909
He's coming.

01:45.129 --> 01:47.159
- Hi, guys. What's up?
- Nothing.

01:47.530 --> 01:49.700
So you were doing your laundry?

01:49.930 --> 01:52.489
There's a washer and dryer
in the cellar.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.950
Don't you love when
they're still warm?

01:56.530 --> 02:00.640
"Wrinkle-free." Right, after you
iron it for about 15 minutes.

02:01.930 --> 02:04.030
Good to see you being domestic.

02:04.329 --> 02:07.280
Yeah. You seem all calm and homey.

02:07.930 --> 02:09.300
Are you on drugs?

02:09.729 --> 02:14.259
I know I've caused you a lot of grief
over Darla, and I apologize.

02:15.729 --> 02:17.479
Darla may never need my help.

02:18.729 --> 02:23.009
I can only be there for her if
and when she decides to come around.

02:23.530 --> 02:26.509
But I can't do it for her,
and I know that now.

02:27.729 --> 02:28.780
We had tea.

02:28.930 --> 02:33.039
In the meantime, there's nothing
I can do but let go.

02:33.729 --> 02:35.060
I found Darla.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.990
Wasn't easy, but my knowledge...

02:38.530 --> 02:40.280
...of L.A.'s motels paid off.

02:40.930 --> 02:43.180
- You lied to us.
- I did, I know.

02:43.930 --> 02:44.800
Why?

02:45.129 --> 02:46.740
Figured you'd nag.

02:48.129 --> 02:50.379
- Royal Viking Motel.
- Near skid row.

02:50.530 --> 02:52.849
She's not living
off Wolfram & Hart now.

02:53.530 --> 02:54.969
They'll look for her.

02:55.330 --> 02:58.419
- What do you think they'll do?
- Let's get there first.

02:59.530 --> 03:04.030
If you expect us to go with you on a
wild goose chase, guess again.

03:04.930 --> 03:07.840
We're not going to enable you
in your addiction!

03:08.530 --> 03:10.879
Didn't we learn anything from the tea?

03:12.000 --> 03:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:53.370 --> 03:55.159
You're a hard one to find.

05:02.769 --> 05:04.209
Thanks for coming in.

05:05.170 --> 05:06.850
Did I ever have a choice?

05:08.769 --> 05:09.709
Of course.

05:14.769 --> 05:17.509
We would never force you
against your will.

05:17.769 --> 05:20.259
It wasn't my will to even be here.

05:20.769 --> 05:22.980
I never asked for this life.

05:24.370 --> 05:27.180
Well, no one ever does.

05:27.970 --> 05:29.899
God doesn't give us a say.

05:30.970 --> 05:33.180
God wasn't the one
who brought me back.

05:33.370 --> 05:34.420
True.

05:35.170 --> 05:38.889
What do you want me to do?
Go back to him?

05:39.370 --> 05:42.250
There's nothing between us anymore.

05:44.170 --> 05:45.470
You misunderstand.

05:45.970 --> 05:48.709
We didn't invite you here
to discuss Angel.

05:50.769 --> 05:52.000
This is about you.

05:52.569 --> 05:54.600
You're not our prisoner, Darla.

05:56.170 --> 05:59.120
You are, however,
our moral responsibility.

06:05.170 --> 06:08.860
You probably don't remember
your first few weeks with us.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.639
No one remembers their
first days of life...

06:12.970 --> 06:15.180
...but that's when
these were initiated.

06:16.569 --> 06:18.569
Did you know anything about this?

06:21.370 --> 06:23.860
We'll deal with this
any way you see fit.

06:24.970 --> 06:26.300
It's up to you.

06:27.370 --> 06:29.439
We just thought you should know.

06:38.170 --> 06:39.959
- She ain't here, bro.
- No.

06:40.569 --> 06:43.269
But she was, not long ago.

06:43.569 --> 06:46.100
- I smell the fear.
- Don't envy that talent.

06:47.170 --> 06:50.259
Not based on what I'm getting
with my human smeller.

06:50.769 --> 06:53.230
Not even for free cable, you know?

06:53.769 --> 06:55.699
She chose this place
for a reason.

06:57.970 --> 07:00.529
- How'd you--
- Motel. She didn't live here.

07:00.970 --> 07:02.720
I wouldn't call it living.

07:03.970 --> 07:06.569
Looks like maybe she was
expecting company.

07:06.970 --> 07:08.410
In the form of you.

07:11.170 --> 07:12.149
No blood.

07:12.370 --> 07:14.829
- Nothing new, anyway.
- You smell that too?

07:15.370 --> 07:18.699
- Room's seen a lot of it.
- Step down from her last digs.

07:21.970 --> 07:24.990
When you're desperate, you do
what you have to do.

07:35.170 --> 07:37.339
Don't these people know who we are?

07:37.569 --> 07:40.100
I think they do.
Explains the lynch mob.

07:41.170 --> 07:42.889
Look, we should all rest.

07:42.970 --> 07:46.970
It'll be dawn in a few hours,
and she won't last carrying us both.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.910
I hate the French.
We should go to Romania.

07:53.170 --> 07:55.269
In Italy you wanted France.

07:55.569 --> 07:58.829
In Romania they know how
to treat a vampire.

07:59.769 --> 08:02.959
You said you were craving
rich food. Something French.

08:05.769 --> 08:07.209
The valley seems quiet.

08:07.569 --> 08:10.379
I told you, we lost them back in Arles.

08:11.170 --> 08:13.769
This man Holtz. How does
he keep finding us?

08:16.569 --> 08:18.430
We stay in the best hotels...

08:18.970 --> 08:22.449
...order room service,
eat the waiters. People talk.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.029
Holtz is no mere mortal.

08:25.569 --> 08:28.660
Of course he is. He's just a man.
A vampire hunter.

08:29.170 --> 08:31.870
Drove us into a barn, like animals.

08:32.769 --> 08:35.019
All right, then, let's be animals.

08:35.769 --> 08:37.700
At least for tonight. Unless...

08:38.169 --> 08:39.710
...you're too tired.

08:39.970 --> 08:42.950
- Shouldn't we keep watch?
- I can see the window.

08:43.570 --> 08:46.480
And we'll hear hoofbeats,
should anyone approach.

08:50.769 --> 08:52.909
You always make the best of it.

08:53.169 --> 08:56.720
You have to admit, the chase
can be exhilarating.

08:58.570 --> 09:01.269
Especially with the proper companion.

09:04.570 --> 09:05.480
Bastards!

09:06.450 --> 09:07.889
That's great.

09:08.250 --> 09:10.639
Really, very threatening.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.990
Getting to you, isn't it?
When I was a human...

09:14.250 --> 09:16.529
...I didn't have much luck with women.

09:17.250 --> 09:19.809
- Hard to believe.
- Had a skin condition.

09:20.250 --> 09:24.009
But now, something about the teeth.
Chicks go crazy for it.

09:25.049 --> 09:28.070
You've got girlfriends everywhere,
I imagine.

09:28.649 --> 09:31.490
Mostly I just kill them.
Dump the bodies.

09:32.250 --> 09:34.350
That must be very lonely for you.

09:34.649 --> 09:37.070
We're lonely, we creatures
of the night.

09:37.649 --> 09:39.750
Doomed to walk the earth.

09:41.250 --> 09:43.110
How long have you been...?

09:43.649 --> 09:46.909
An eternal child of darkness?
Since '92.

09:47.850 --> 09:49.639
1992?

09:50.250 --> 09:52.740
It's already the last century.

09:54.450 --> 09:57.889
And in all this time,
you've never considered...

09:58.649 --> 10:00.190
...making yourself a mate?

10:01.049 --> 10:01.990
How do you mean?

10:02.850 --> 10:06.820
Well, isn't it true that
some vampires choose a mortal7.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.539
Someone they can sire.

10:10.049 --> 10:12.889
Someone who too can walk
those lonely nights...

10:13.649 --> 10:16.669
...hunting with them,
feeding with them.

10:17.850 --> 10:19.080
Joining with them.

10:23.250 --> 10:24.509
That'd be weird.

10:24.450 --> 10:26.840
Weird? It's mythic.

10:28.649 --> 10:31.769
You read too much Anne Rice.
You've got no idea....

10:32.250 --> 10:33.120
Teach me.

10:34.049 --> 10:35.629
You want me to make you?

10:35.850 --> 10:38.340
You think I came in here
for the snacks?

10:38.850 --> 10:41.340
Sweetheart, in this bar
you are the snacks.

10:43.049 --> 10:46.809
I live nearby. We can go to my place,
you can do it there.

10:47.850 --> 10:49.600
You're serious about this.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.850
So what? I make you and then...

10:53.250 --> 10:55.070
...you'd be my immortal babe?

10:55.649 --> 10:57.190
Yes.

10:58.049 --> 11:00.259
That sounds like commitment to me.

11:01.049 --> 11:02.870
Then use me as long
as you like...

11:03.450 --> 11:06.639
...any way you like, then discard me.
No strings.

11:10.649 --> 11:12.539
There's an alley out back.

11:14.250 --> 11:17.940
What if I just kill you?
Drain you and leave your body.

11:22.649 --> 11:24.090
I'll take my chances.

11:25.049 --> 11:27.080
I should probably mention...

11:28.049 --> 11:30.820
- ...I'm not clear on how this works.
- What?

11:31.649 --> 11:35.830
I never did it to anybody. And I
was out when it happened to me.

11:37.649 --> 11:39.259
I'll walk you through it.

11:40.049 --> 11:43.879
Drink. When you feel my heart
start to slow, stop.

11:50.850 --> 11:53.059
- What are you doing?
- Saving you.

11:53.850 --> 11:56.340
I wasn't in danger,
Angelus, believe me.

11:56.850 --> 12:00.009
I always pick the stupid ones,
didn't you know?

12:01.049 --> 12:04.769
- I can take care of myself.
- I was saving you from yourself.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.269
- Who asked you?
- This isn't the answer.

12:08.850 --> 12:11.100
You don't even know the question.

12:11.250 --> 12:13.639
You do this, I won't leave you alone.

12:14.250 --> 12:17.299
Next time, it'll be you
on the end of this stake.

12:19.649 --> 12:22.250
I'm sorry, but I don't
want that. Not again.

12:23.250 --> 12:25.350
I won't let it happen twice.

12:25.649 --> 12:28.950
- Where are you going?
- I'll try the west side.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.269
- Another dive?
- What do you care?

12:32.850 --> 12:33.720
This isn't you.

12:34.049 --> 12:36.860
We had 150 years together,
but you don't know me.

12:37.049 --> 12:39.720
You really want to be made
in an alley?

12:41.850 --> 12:43.389
I wanted you to do it.

12:44.850 --> 12:46.460
That'll never happen.

12:47.250 --> 12:50.409
I do what I have to do.
Anyway, you were made in an alley.

12:50.850 --> 12:52.570
- That's not the point.
- What is?

12:53.250 --> 12:56.200
The point is, you were
undead for 400 years.

12:56.850 --> 12:59.940
You've been human for a few months.
Give it a chance.

13:01.049 --> 13:03.539
- I don't have time.
- Yes, you do.

13:04.049 --> 13:05.419
Don't throw this away--

13:05.850 --> 13:07.179
I'm dying.

13:08.850 --> 13:09.549
What?

13:10.049 --> 13:10.750
Yeah.

13:11.250 --> 13:13.879
And not sometime, not later. Now.

13:14.850 --> 13:16.429
Right now.

13:17.250 --> 13:19.919
They showed me my medical files.
The tests say...

13:20.250 --> 13:22.000
...I've got two months left.

13:22.649 --> 13:24.899
So excuse me,
I'm in sort of a hurry.

13:35.850 --> 13:38.620
- How many men are there?
- I can't die like this.

13:38.850 --> 13:40.570
We could flee to the hills.

13:41.250 --> 13:43.850
We can't make it on foot
before sunrise.

13:46.649 --> 13:48.679
We'll not make it easy for them.

13:49.049 --> 13:52.669
Between the two of us,
we can go out with a reputation.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.460
Even death, with the right companion--

13:58.049 --> 13:59.450
I hope you survive.

14:00.450 --> 14:03.220
If you do, maybe we'll
meet again in Vienna.

14:15.009 --> 14:16.409
Angel's back!

14:17.409 --> 14:19.019
He has Darla with him!

14:22.809 --> 14:23.970
Hi.

14:26.409 --> 14:28.940
You're planning on sleeping over?

14:30.009 --> 14:31.059
I'm dying.

14:31.210 --> 14:33.070
- So just one night?
- Dying?

14:33.450 --> 14:35.269
- He doesn't believe it.
- What?

14:35.850 --> 14:40.100
Wolfram & Hart showed her some files
that say she only has a few months.

14:40.649 --> 14:43.559
- So more than one night?
- You think it's a trick?

14:44.250 --> 14:47.370
Of course it's a trick.
They're playing mind games.

14:48.450 --> 14:50.200
- To what end?
- I don't know.

14:50.850 --> 14:53.870
- You just won't believe it.
- I can't believe them.

14:54.450 --> 14:56.129
They can't be trusted.

14:56.250 --> 14:59.019
I don't trust them.
But I know mind games.

14:59.850 --> 15:02.730
So do you. We've played them together.

15:03.450 --> 15:06.399
You were just soulless demons.
They're lawyers.

15:07.049 --> 15:09.220
She's right. We were amateurs.

15:10.649 --> 15:12.049
And if you're wrong?

15:13.049 --> 15:13.750
I'm not.

15:14.850 --> 15:16.389
And I'll prove it to you.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.000
Can you watch her for a while?

15:20.250 --> 15:21.620
I'll be back soon.

15:22.049 --> 15:23.700
- Sure.
- Don't worry about it.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.580
- You can't keep me.
- You're not a prisoner.

15:28.649 --> 15:30.610
I've heard that a lot lately.

15:31.049 --> 15:33.259
Just give me a chance, okay?

15:37.049 --> 15:40.240
So. First up, you're a prisoner.

15:41.250 --> 15:42.929
I have to concur with that.

15:43.049 --> 15:47.620
- You've got our friend all in knots.
- Can't say we like you much.

15:49.049 --> 15:52.279
So, sorry about the dying,
but if you try to escape...

15:53.250 --> 15:55.139
- ...we will hit you.
- On the head.

15:55.649 --> 15:59.299
With very large and
heavy objects. Okay?

16:07.210 --> 16:09.950
- Maybe I can't come in but--
- Wipe your feet.

16:12.009 --> 16:12.919
What?

16:15.009 --> 16:16.759
Wipe your feet. Come in.

16:19.210 --> 16:21.279
Jeez, I invited you in already.

16:27.610 --> 16:29.779
Do you really need to throttle me?

16:30.610 --> 16:31.309
Need to?

16:37.210 --> 16:38.330
Yes, she's dying.

16:39.610 --> 16:41.500
Those medical reports are real.

16:42.009 --> 16:43.899
Want a second opinion? Here.

16:45.610 --> 16:48.279
How about a third? How about a tenth?

16:48.610 --> 16:51.070
I used every connection we had.

16:53.409 --> 16:54.850
That's my own doctor.

16:55.210 --> 16:58.759
They're all the same:
Syphilitic heart condition. Terminal.

17:00.009 --> 17:02.539
Darla was a working girl
in the New World.

17:04.210 --> 17:06.309
Had syphilis when she was human.

17:08.410 --> 17:09.670
She's human again.

17:09.608 --> 17:11.470
Picking up where she left off.

17:12.009 --> 17:15.799
Today that can be cleared up with
antibiotics, if you catch it.

17:16.809 --> 17:20.180
We're about a month and, what--
400 years too late?

17:25.809 --> 17:27.700
You didn't believe it either.

17:33.609 --> 17:35.079
So it's true.

17:37.210 --> 17:38.650
I had to be sure.

17:39.609 --> 17:40.309
Why?

17:40.809 --> 17:44.460
Why? I don't want her to die
any more than you do.

17:54.009 --> 17:55.619
Do you love her, Lindsey?

17:57.609 --> 17:59.119
Is that what this is?

18:01.210 --> 18:04.440
Look at you. A few months
with her, you're a schoolboy.

18:04.809 --> 18:07.160
I was with her for 150 years.

18:09.009 --> 18:10.589
But you never loved her.

18:12.009 --> 18:15.700
- I wasn't capable, neither are you.
- Maybe not.

18:16.809 --> 18:20.599
But I'd save her if I could.
You can, and you won't.

18:21.609 --> 18:22.839
You've got a choice.

18:24.009 --> 18:26.990
Waste her life searching
for a cure that doesn't exist.

18:27.609 --> 18:28.839
Watch her die.

18:29.410 --> 18:31.269
Or use your only real power.

18:31.809 --> 18:34.230
You can make this disease go away.

18:34.809 --> 18:37.759
- By killing her.
- Giving her life. Eternal life.

18:38.410 --> 18:40.660
Then what, Lindsey?
You can be together?

18:41.410 --> 18:42.849
If I were to do it...

18:43.210 --> 18:47.630
...how long do you think it would be
before she hunted you down?

18:49.210 --> 18:52.230
Gotta say, that thought
almost makes it worth it.

18:52.809 --> 18:55.269
But there's another way. I'll find it.

18:58.890 --> 19:01.700
Not only is she putting
his life at stake...

19:02.490 --> 19:06.069
...but ours. After 400 years
of death and destruction...

19:06.690 --> 19:10.450
...it seems to me you get voted
off the island. Am I right?

19:13.890 --> 19:15.009
You're back.

19:16.890 --> 19:18.960
Was it good news?

19:25.890 --> 19:28.029
Give me a minute, will you, guys?

19:38.490 --> 19:43.059
Jasmine. It blooms at night.
I remember what that was like.

19:53.490 --> 19:55.210
I told you it was the truth.

19:55.890 --> 19:57.190
- Darla.
- I have to go.

19:57.089 --> 19:58.630
We'll find a cure.

19:59.490 --> 20:03.319
I've been around long enough
to recognize a lost cause.

20:03.690 --> 20:05.160
Unless....

20:06.690 --> 20:10.170
That's exactly what they
want us to do, Darla.

20:10.289 --> 20:12.819
I don't care. I don't want to die.

20:13.890 --> 20:15.470
- I can't do it.
- I need it.

20:15.690 --> 20:19.019
No, you don't. I don't know
what you need. I wish I did.

20:22.890 --> 20:24.259
I don't know either.

20:27.089 --> 20:27.859
No...

20:28.289 --> 20:32.680
...you do. You're the only one that
could. You just can't see it.

20:33.690 --> 20:34.880
You need help.

20:47.490 --> 20:51.420
Ill wind blow away

20:53.490 --> 20:57.630
let me rest today

20:59.490 --> 21:04.269
You're blowing me no good

21:08.490 --> 21:09.859
What does that mean?

21:10.289 --> 21:14.400
It means, Ground Control to Major Tom,
may not be able to save her.

21:15.690 --> 21:17.859
I'm gonna do it.
You're gonna help me.

21:18.089 --> 21:20.970
I sense pain and anger. Still testy?

21:21.690 --> 21:25.799
Because you sent me to a swami
whose impostor tried to kill me?

21:26.490 --> 21:28.880
It was painful. I'm still reeling.

21:29.490 --> 21:31.980
I feel your pain,
trying to kill me and all.

21:32.490 --> 21:35.440
People try to kill you every day.
I mean Ramone.

21:36.089 --> 21:37.980
Overheard us and betrayed me.

21:38.490 --> 21:40.029
A world-class bartender.

21:40.289 --> 21:43.059
He made a Sea Breeze
that took you to Tahiti.

21:43.890 --> 21:45.289
He's off the menu now.

21:45.690 --> 21:49.410
- Can we get back to Darla?
- If you'll shush up and listen.

21:53.490 --> 21:58.970
You're only misleading
the sunshine I'm needing

22:00.089 --> 22:03.319
Ain't that a shame

22:04.890 --> 22:08.009
It's so hard to keep up

22:08.490 --> 22:11.089
With troubles that creep up

22:16.289 --> 22:17.730
Aren't you reading her?

22:18.089 --> 22:19.559
I'm a channel surfer.

22:19.890 --> 22:23.720
You're a big hunk of hero sandwich.
You want to save the girl.

22:24.690 --> 22:28.269
I can see why. But you're missing
the crucial point here.

22:28.890 --> 22:32.259
Not everything
can be put back together.

22:33.089 --> 22:35.759
- She can't die.
- Why do you care so much?

22:36.089 --> 22:38.859
She had more than most of us.
400-plus years.

22:39.690 --> 22:42.039
As a vampire. Before that, she was--

22:43.890 --> 22:45.539
She never had a chance.

22:48.690 --> 22:53.259
No good

22:58.890 --> 23:02.680
Someone get my heart.
That girl's ripped it right out.

23:03.690 --> 23:06.359
I know I'm probably
going to regret this.

23:07.289 --> 23:10.059
In fact, being prescient,
I'm sure of it.

23:10.289 --> 23:11.519
There is one way.

23:12.089 --> 23:16.480
- It's a bit of a quest. May kill you.
- I'll take it.

23:17.490 --> 23:20.440
All right, big fella,
you asked for it.

23:21.089 --> 23:23.789
You're about to face hell
and high water.

23:24.690 --> 23:25.740
Go to this address.

23:28.890 --> 23:29.829
What is it?

23:30.690 --> 23:33.809
Where we find out if you're
ready to take the plunge.

23:38.289 --> 23:41.480
- Well, here we are.
- I don't think this is right.

23:41.890 --> 23:43.920
He said I had to take the plunge.

23:44.289 --> 23:46.569
- Into an empty pool?
- Sure.

23:47.289 --> 23:50.480
With water you'd miss out
on all that skull crushing.

23:51.490 --> 23:53.450
Maybe he meant another pool.

23:53.890 --> 23:56.099
Something in the koi pond. Very Zen.

23:56.890 --> 23:59.240
It's a test.
A leap-of-faith thing.

24:00.490 --> 24:01.890
Then don't do it.

24:02.289 --> 24:06.150
A green-faced lounge singer asks
you to do this, and you do it?

24:08.890 --> 24:10.190
Why?

24:14.289 --> 24:16.359
I'll either be back with a cure...

24:17.289 --> 24:19.500
...or you're about to see
something funny.

24:25.089 --> 24:28.599
You certainly have faith.
Now we'll test your valor.

24:29.890 --> 24:32.660
I shall be assisting you
with the trials, sir.

24:33.490 --> 24:37.039
- Darla. Why is she here?
- You wish to save her life?

24:38.289 --> 24:40.609
- Yes.
- She's your collateral then.

24:41.289 --> 24:44.980
Should you complete all three trials,
she will be made whole.

24:45.490 --> 24:48.900
- What happens if I don't?
- She dies instantly.

24:50.890 --> 24:55.460
In the meantime, Darla, relax with
a beverage in our antechamber.

24:56.890 --> 24:57.660
No.

24:58.089 --> 25:01.740
It's better this way. Soon,
no living thing will be safe in here.

25:02.890 --> 25:03.759
Nobody said--

25:04.089 --> 25:07.740
Sorry for the misunderstanding,
but life is the bargain here.

25:08.289 --> 25:11.769
By entering, you have placed hers
in the balance.

25:13.089 --> 25:17.369
Along with your own, of course.
You'd best get ready now, sir.

25:18.490 --> 25:21.299
This is no time to be dwelling
on the negative.

25:28.049 --> 25:30.750
Your trials will consist
of three challenges.

25:31.650 --> 25:33.789
I'll need your shirt and shoes.

25:37.650 --> 25:38.769
Unarmed combat?

25:40.650 --> 25:42.400
Well, you'll be unarmed, yes.

25:44.250 --> 25:46.950
Okay, three challenges. What are they?

25:49.049 --> 25:50.380
That's for you to discover.

25:52.049 --> 25:53.700
Shoes and socks, please.

25:56.849 --> 25:59.730
You've seen this before.
Give me something.

26:00.450 --> 26:04.029
- I've never given information before.
- How many asked?

26:07.049 --> 26:09.720
In theory,
the first test is child's play.

26:10.650 --> 26:14.269
- That gate opens, you walk through it.
- That's it?

26:16.650 --> 26:20.130
- What's the catch?
- That would be telling, wouldn't it?

26:20.849 --> 26:22.500
What's two and three?

26:22.650 --> 26:25.390
I wouldn't know about
the last two tests.

26:26.250 --> 26:28.000
Nobody survives the first one.

26:30.450 --> 26:31.680
Best of luck.

26:43.650 --> 26:44.880
You must be the catch.

26:56.849 --> 27:00.079
Seventeen seconds.
Twice the time others have lasted.

27:00.450 --> 27:02.940
- Call this off.
- Impossible.

27:03.450 --> 27:05.099
The tests can't be stopped.

27:06.450 --> 27:10.029
- I need to see what's happening. Now.
- If you insist.

27:11.250 --> 27:14.410
But please remember, you did ask.

27:57.450 --> 28:00.400
Hey, I defeated him! Open up!

28:55.049 --> 28:57.789
This how a guy like you gets
his rocks off?

28:59.250 --> 29:02.509
I have no feelings
about this contest, miss.

29:04.049 --> 29:04.849
Do you?

29:35.009 --> 29:37.009
Why don't you just kill him?

29:37.410 --> 29:40.819
We don't want anything, miss.
The journey is all.

29:42.210 --> 29:44.210
Where it leads is not our concern.

30:12.809 --> 30:13.680
Holy water.

30:28.410 --> 30:29.849
He's quite remarkable.

30:32.009 --> 30:33.589
Yes, he is.

30:49.569 --> 30:53.049
Well played. You've fielded
our strokes from end to end.

30:53.769 --> 30:57.880
My hat's off to you, sir. Of course,
there is one final challenge.

31:06.369 --> 31:08.859
- What is this?
- I think you know, sir.

31:14.170 --> 31:16.799
Stakes. You call this...

31:18.970 --> 31:20.200
...a test?

31:22.569 --> 31:25.240
- Only way it works is you kill me?
- Exactly.

31:26.170 --> 31:30.140
You do understand this third test
has no catch, as you put it.

31:30.970 --> 31:32.930
Death is the final challenge.

31:33.970 --> 31:37.089
We can't restore one life
without taking another.

31:37.569 --> 31:40.059
In order for Darla to live,
you must die.

31:45.690 --> 31:48.460
My apologies for any discomfort
this causes.

31:48.690 --> 31:50.549
I really can't imagine the pain.

31:51.089 --> 31:53.049
How about we switch places?

31:54.089 --> 31:56.859
My death wouldn't balance
a thing. Yours--

31:57.690 --> 31:58.849
I die, Darla lives.

31:59.490 --> 32:03.420
Yes. I'm unaware of any deities
the vampire worships.

32:04.289 --> 32:05.970
But if you'd like to pray...

32:09.690 --> 32:11.269
...now would be the time.

32:13.890 --> 32:14.970
Don't do this.

32:15.690 --> 32:17.720
- What are you waiting for?
- For you.

32:18.089 --> 32:21.210
I need your permission.
You've earned a choice.

32:22.289 --> 32:24.890
Accept your death
so that she may live or....

32:25.289 --> 32:26.369
Or what?!

32:28.890 --> 32:31.519
Leave. Refuse the challenge
and walk away.

32:31.890 --> 32:33.890
No one will stop you.

32:34.890 --> 32:37.099
- Our doors are open.
- What about Darla?

32:37.890 --> 32:40.029
- Oh, she dies.
- No deal.

32:40.890 --> 32:43.869
I expected as much.
A pity. I like you.

32:45.089 --> 32:45.960
Spare me.

32:46.890 --> 32:48.329
I'd very much like to.

32:50.490 --> 32:52.519
Do you mind if I ask you a question?

32:54.089 --> 32:57.109
Isn't the world a better place
with you in it?

32:57.690 --> 32:59.650
You can save so many people.

33:00.089 --> 33:02.230
It seems she can barely save herself.

33:10.890 --> 33:13.519
The world can be a very bad place.

33:14.490 --> 33:18.910
Take yourself out, and how long
will it be before she stumbles?

33:19.289 --> 33:20.759
I don't know.

33:21.690 --> 33:24.430
No, you don't.

33:25.289 --> 33:29.640
Are you still ready to give your life
when she can promise you nothing?

33:33.089 --> 33:34.349
Yes.

33:36.690 --> 33:38.089
As you wish.

33:44.490 --> 33:45.650
No.

33:51.690 --> 33:53.269
Do it.

33:58.890 --> 34:00.220
No!

34:08.489 --> 34:09.500
Angel!

34:10.289 --> 34:14.789
Congratulations. You've passed
the third test by accepting death.

34:16.289 --> 34:20.079
No one's ever gone that far before,
in terms of sacrifice.

34:21.090 --> 34:23.300
- Kudos.
- Pay up.

34:24.090 --> 34:27.070
Of course. You're a lucky woman.

34:27.690 --> 34:30.880
Soon you'll have your whole life
ahead. Use it wisely.

34:31.289 --> 34:35.219
Hey, unless this fortune cookie
crap is some new torture...

34:36.090 --> 34:38.159
...let's get on with it.

34:39.690 --> 34:41.059
This way, miss.

34:54.090 --> 34:55.099
- What?
- What is it?

34:55.289 --> 34:58.340
- This is very embarrassing.
- What is?

34:59.489 --> 35:01.239
Not to mention unprecedented.

35:03.690 --> 35:07.340
She's been given new life once before.
By supernatural means?

35:08.489 --> 35:12.349
- They brought me back.
- What are you saying?

35:14.489 --> 35:17.610
- I can't help you.
- We had a bargain.

35:18.090 --> 35:20.300
She's earned a second chance.

35:21.690 --> 35:23.650
She's living her second chance.

35:27.090 --> 35:29.190
But you played magnificently.

35:30.690 --> 35:33.989
You should've told us
she was brought to life before this.

35:36.090 --> 35:37.630
I truly am sorry, sir.

35:38.489 --> 35:41.539
The fact of the matter is,
there's nothing I can do.

35:50.489 --> 35:51.570
Angel.

36:47.889 --> 36:49.050
It may be different.

36:50.889 --> 36:51.900
We don't know.

36:53.889 --> 36:57.539
Maybe, because, you know,
I have a soul...

36:58.090 --> 37:00.480
- ...if I did bite you--
- No.

37:01.090 --> 37:02.630
We don't know what it'll do.

37:05.289 --> 37:08.980
Angel, I've seen it now.
Everything you're going through...

37:09.489 --> 37:12.159
...everything you've gone through.
I felt it.

37:14.889 --> 37:19.460
I felt how you care the way
no one's ever cared before.

37:20.289 --> 37:21.659
Not for me.

37:26.889 --> 37:29.380
- That's all I need.
- It's not enough.

37:30.489 --> 37:31.429
It is.

37:32.889 --> 37:35.309
How could The Powers bring you back...

37:35.289 --> 37:37.920
...and take a second chance
away like this?

37:39.489 --> 37:41.880
Maybe this is my second chance.

37:43.690 --> 37:44.880
To die?

37:45.489 --> 37:47.909
Yes, to die.

37:49.090 --> 37:51.550
The way I was supposed to
in the first place.

38:08.289 --> 38:09.800
I'm not gonna leave you.

38:13.690 --> 38:17.550
Every moment you have left,
I'm gonna be by your side.

38:20.889 --> 38:23.059
You never have to be alone again.

38:49.250 --> 38:51.389
How'd you think this would end?

40:50.489 --> 40:52.489
Thank you, thank you very much,

40:53.305 --> 40:59.531
