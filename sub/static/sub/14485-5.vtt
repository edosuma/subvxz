00:33.933 --> 00:37.721
People, we got a problem.
Nibbler's been coughing up hairballs.

00:37.933 --> 00:40.766
So has Fry. What's the big deal?

00:42.533 --> 00:43.761
He's got me beat.

00:43.973 --> 00:48.330
We all love Nibbler, so it's only fair
that we all clean up together.

00:48.533 --> 00:52.242
Still, I propose we make Zoidberg
do it. All in favor?

00:52.773 --> 00:54.684
All opposed?

00:55.333 --> 00:57.164
All abstaining?

00:57.533 --> 01:00.411
Dr. Zoidberg, are you okay?

01:01.093 --> 01:02.765
He's dead.

01:03.173 --> 01:05.242
He always seemed so full of life.

01:05.453 --> 01:10.527
Laughing, singing, begging for scraps.
And now this!

01:12.973 --> 01:15.009
Why with all the crying?

01:15.173 --> 01:18.131
So, that's where I left my shell.

01:19.173 --> 01:20.925
I didn't know it came off.

01:21.093 --> 01:24.688
It was getting a little cramped,
so I molted, why not?

01:25.573 --> 01:29.202
- The fresh air feels good.
- Stop doing that!

01:29.893 --> 01:33.329
So long. I'm off to toss
this old shell in the dumpster...

01:33.493 --> 01:36.929
...and maybe pick up the potato chips
Amy didn't finish.

01:37.133 --> 01:40.967
- Those were toenail clippings.
- A feast is a feast.

01:44.013 --> 01:46.607
Hey, that's my cell phone!

01:48.933 --> 01:50.969
Hello?

01:52.533 --> 01:56.082
Hello? Who is this?

01:56.253 --> 01:58.448
Hello?

01:59.773 --> 02:01.968
Did you swallow your phone again?

02:02.133 --> 02:05.967
Some guy's been calling and hanging
up 1 0 times a day for a year.

02:06.173 --> 02:08.607
Men who call too much
are the worst, I bet.

02:08.812 --> 02:10.963
I wish a decent guy would call me.

02:11.133 --> 02:16.161
Not this spleeze-ball who has me
too terrified to answer the phone.

02:16.333 --> 02:18.005
Hello?

02:21.493 --> 02:23.961
<i>Hello? Is anyone there?</i>

02:24.133 --> 02:25.964
I love you!

02:35.093 --> 02:40.087
Why must I be such a coward?

02:40.253 --> 02:43.370
I'm off to the men's room,
and I need an attendant...

02:43.533 --> 02:46.650
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're crying like a woman.

02:46.813 --> 02:51.762
I see myself as a father figure
to some of my more pathetic men.

02:51.933 --> 02:54.891
Kif, old friend, let's rap.

02:55.093 --> 02:58.768
Well, I'm in love with this girl.

03:00.693 --> 03:04.163
Oh, that's rich! Go on.

03:04.373 --> 03:05.726
I met her a year ago...

03:05.893 --> 03:10.364
...escaping from that cruise ship
you piloted into a black hole.

03:11.693 --> 03:14.048
<i>Yes, it was in all the papers.</i>

03:17.933 --> 03:19.491
Call me.

03:25.773 --> 03:28.651
- I've finished talking.
- Belay that remark!

03:29.013 --> 03:33.291
Your Amy knows my Leela?
I have formed an idea.

03:35.533 --> 03:39.003
I want to negotiate a double date.
You and me, Kif and Amy.

03:39.173 --> 03:40.162
<i>Forget it!</i>

03:40.373 --> 03:44.412
<i>Then let the negotiations begin.</i>
<i>I propose we go out on 1 0 dates.</i>

03:44.613 --> 03:46.126
- How about zero?
- Nine.

03:46.333 --> 03:48.289
- Zero.
- Seven? Eight?

03:48.493 --> 03:52.088
Please? Kif's the sweetest guy
who ever liked me.

03:52.293 --> 03:55.251
Five, and that's my final offer.
Four!

03:55.973 --> 03:57.008
- One.
- Two.

03:57.213 --> 03:58.532
- Half.
- I'll take it.

03:58.733 --> 04:02.442
<i>We'll meet you for part of dinner</i>
<i>and half of a movie.</i>

04:14.813 --> 04:20.968
Sir? I don't go out on many dates.
What if I don't know what to say?

04:21.173 --> 04:23.084
Here's my book of pickup lines.

04:23.253 --> 04:27.166
Say as many as you can,
as fast as you can. Don't stop.

04:27.333 --> 04:31.485
- I'll just give her these flowers.
- Wrong, wrong, wrong.

04:31.653 --> 04:36.249
And what's that? Candy?
Candy's for dorks. Give me that.

04:49.173 --> 04:52.927
- Hello, beautiful. I got these for you.
- Thanks.

04:56.173 --> 05:01.167
Well, well. This looks to be
one disturbingly erotic date.

05:01.373 --> 05:02.522
Half-date.

05:02.733 --> 05:04.610
- A bottle of wine.
- Half-bottle.

05:04.773 --> 05:07.810
- And oysters on the half-shell.
- Quarter-shell.

05:07.973 --> 05:11.090
- And I'd like...
- He's not hungry. It's expensive.

05:11.293 --> 05:15.252
I'd like two steaks, and the ladies
will have sensual salads...

05:15.413 --> 05:17.688
...with low-cal sensual dressing.

05:31.493 --> 05:33.165
Thank you.

05:34.853 --> 05:37.731
Kif, you haven't said a word
all night.

05:37.933 --> 05:39.810
Well...

05:40.573 --> 05:42.529
Hello.

05:42.693 --> 05:46.732
Because I was really hoping
we could talk and stuff.

05:52.013 --> 05:54.686
"If I said you had a beautiful body...

05:54.853 --> 05:57.413
...would you take your pants off
and dance?"

05:57.573 --> 06:00.610
- What?
- Lieutenant Kroker!

06:02.213 --> 06:05.888
"I find the most erotic part
of a woman is the boobies."

06:07.613 --> 06:11.811
This half-date is entirely over.
Amy? Conference.

06:12.013 --> 06:14.686
Is there nothing we can do?

06:14.853 --> 06:18.448
There's one way into a woman's heart
and parts beyond.

06:18.613 --> 06:20.808
I speak, of course, of karaoke.

06:20.973 --> 06:24.932
My years in the Duke Boys' Chorus
will not have been in vain.

06:27.333 --> 06:30.405
All right, enough lipstick.
Let's storm out.

06:37.053 --> 06:39.567
Oh, that's so emotional!

06:43.333 --> 06:44.652
Amateur hour's over.

06:44.813 --> 06:48.249
Let me show you why they call me
"The Velour Fog."

06:48.413 --> 06:49.892
Hit it.

07:05.013 --> 07:07.846
- Give us a break.
- He sickens me!

07:42.093 --> 07:44.402
We're going home.
Call us a space taxi.

07:44.573 --> 07:47.963
No need. There's not a
restaurant built I can't fly.

07:48.133 --> 07:49.248
Where to, ladies?

07:49.413 --> 07:52.962
Please, sir.
Let's just divide up the check, and...

07:53.453 --> 07:55.967
Let's see what this eatery can do.

08:00.973 --> 08:05.012
She's built like a steak house,
but she handles like a bistro.

08:05.773 --> 08:07.650
She's out of control!

08:07.813 --> 08:10.281
You win again, gravity!

08:17.733 --> 08:22.204
Look! My new shell catalog!
So, let's try some on, already!

08:25.773 --> 08:27.411
Ah, <i>muy macho.</i>

08:27.573 --> 08:32.169
Hey, gringos, here comes El Zoido
to ruin your drinking water!

08:32.533 --> 08:33.648
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:33.852 --> 08:36.447
I'm Mexican, and I find that offensive!

08:39.332 --> 08:41.563
You Latins are so hot-blooded.

08:43.013 --> 08:44.765
This one's like a summer guy!

08:44.933 --> 08:49.927
The Planet Express health plan only
covers one kind of replacement shell.

08:55.533 --> 08:58.206
I can't believe Leela and Amy
aren't back.

08:58.373 --> 09:00.682
I'm gonna call the restaurant.

09:02.013 --> 09:05.847
<i>The number you have dialed</i>
<i>has crashed into a planet.</i>

09:07.053 --> 09:09.408
- We gotta go rescue them!
- I don't know.

09:09.613 --> 09:12.286
Bender, think of the <i>señoritas</i>!

09:12.613 --> 09:13.682
<i>Vámonos</i>!

09:23.773 --> 09:25.729
So, Amy...

09:27.173 --> 09:30.722
- It's always a line with you.
- What planet is this?

09:30.893 --> 09:36.331
- This whole sector is uncharted.
- It is not. You lost the chart.

09:36.533 --> 09:41.653
Well, nothing to do but repopulate
the human race, just me and you.

09:41.813 --> 09:43.485
And maybe you.

09:45.493 --> 09:47.211
What is it?

10:00.813 --> 10:06.365
- Me hear people, but me not see.
- Everybody make mistake.

10:09.013 --> 10:11.481
Well, hello.
I usually don't say this...

10:11.653 --> 10:16.602
...but you are the most beautiful trio
of gigantic ladies I've ever seen.

10:19.533 --> 10:23.412
I find the most erotic part
of a woman is the boo...

10:39.973 --> 10:42.282
Oh, no.
Any sign of Leela or Amy?

10:42.493 --> 10:44.848
No, but what do you make of this?

10:45.013 --> 10:48.767
I don't know, but it might have
something to do with this.

10:50.773 --> 10:53.765
Oh, your God!

10:55.693 --> 10:58.048
Move. Go.

10:58.373 --> 11:00.603
All right. Here's the plan.

11:02.653 --> 11:04.928
What kind of moronic plan is that?

11:05.773 --> 11:07.411
Wow.

11:12.653 --> 11:15.611
Women go free. Men stay in chains.

11:15.813 --> 11:19.442
We take them to our leader.
She know what do.

11:19.653 --> 11:21.132
A female leader?

11:21.333 --> 11:23.483
- Fry, shut up!
- Yes, captain.

11:23.693 --> 11:26.412
This capital city, planet Amazonia.

11:26.613 --> 11:30.083
- Where are all the men?
- Men die out many year ago.

11:30.293 --> 11:35.686
They were probably nagged to death.
Are you with me, fellas?

11:38.813 --> 11:42.044
Here stadium, where women
basketball teams play.

11:42.253 --> 11:46.405
- No can dunk, but good fundamentals.
- That more fun to watch.

11:49.053 --> 11:50.771
Oh, God, you're killing me.

11:50.933 --> 11:52.366
God, you're killing me!

11:53.693 --> 11:57.003
This our comedy club.
Humor different here.

11:57.213 --> 11:59.124
It not reinforce stereotypes.

11:59.293 --> 12:03.571
Comedy come from character,
not abstract craziness.

12:03.773 --> 12:06.367
Translation: boring.

12:08.013 --> 12:09.651
That's a good one.

12:09.853 --> 12:14.563
- This planet sounds better and better.
- I'm already looking for apartments.

12:16.573 --> 12:21.044
Here live vengeful, all-knowing
leader. She decide men's fates.

12:21.213 --> 12:24.011
- Is she hot?
- Not important. She all-knowing.

12:24.213 --> 12:26.044
In other words, no.

12:38.373 --> 12:42.048
- All hail Fem-puter.
- All hail Fem-puter!

12:42.213 --> 12:47.492
- You obey a big computer?
- Yes. It appeared at time men die out.

12:47.693 --> 12:51.811
- Why did you make it your leader?
- It different kind of politician.

12:51.973 --> 12:53.691
Not beltway insider.

12:53.893 --> 12:58.284
Fem-puter, we bring offering
of bath beads and scented soaps.

12:58.493 --> 13:04.682
<i>Your gift pleases Fem-puter.</i>
<i>Why are there men on her planet?!</i>

13:04.853 --> 13:07.492
- It was an accident.
<i>- That does not fem-pute.</i>

13:07.653 --> 13:12.602
<i>Fem-puter will return</i>
<i>after deciding your punishment!</i>

13:17.053 --> 13:20.443
I'm through making fun of women.
I want them to help me.

13:20.653 --> 13:22.405
Should we do something?

13:23.493 --> 13:25.006
There's no hurry.

13:25.173 --> 13:28.290
Yes. A little tighter.
Tighter.

13:28.453 --> 13:32.526
Perhaps a hard spanking is in order?
Too hard!

13:32.693 --> 13:36.766
- Men strange. You have them?
- I'm afraid so.

13:36.973 --> 13:38.406
What they for?

13:41.173 --> 13:44.210
You mean snu-snu!

13:45.573 --> 13:48.246
We hear tell men used for snu-snu.

13:48.453 --> 13:52.526
All we have go on are ancient legend
and subscription to <i>Cosmo.</i>

13:52.693 --> 13:55.412
FYI, I could be used for snu-snu.

13:55.573 --> 13:59.361
Silence! You want die
like last men visit Amazonia?

13:59.573 --> 14:02.770
- What did they die of?
- Crushed pelvises.

14:03.573 --> 14:06.133
- Yes!
- Thank you, Lord in heaven!

14:08.933 --> 14:14.565
<i>After lengthy fem-putations,</i>
<i>I have decided the fate of the men.</i>

14:14.733 --> 14:18.442
<i>Fem-puter sentences them to death...</i>

14:20.253 --> 14:22.847
<i>...by snu-snu!</i>
- Yeah!

14:24.253 --> 14:25.845
What are you, gay?

14:32.013 --> 14:36.245
<i>Death to the men!</i>
<i>Death by snu-snu!</i>

14:38.333 --> 14:42.451
- But the snu-snu part will be good.
- Baby, it'll blow your mind.

14:42.653 --> 14:44.245
Be reasonable.

14:44.453 --> 14:48.162
Sure, men are annoying,
and they wreck their planets.

14:48.333 --> 14:53.282
But these men are sort of my friends.
They don't deserve to die.

14:53.573 --> 14:56.610
<i>Perhaps men are not as evil</i>
<i>as Fem-puter thinks.</i>

14:56.813 --> 14:59.043
They make fun women's basketball.

14:59.253 --> 15:02.563
<i>What?! Did you explain how</i>
<i>good fundamentals make up...</i>

15:02.733 --> 15:06.009
<i>...for their inability to dunk?</i>
- Yes. They still laugh.

15:06.213 --> 15:10.092
<i>- The men must die!</i>
- Too true, Fem-puter. You're so wise.

15:10.253 --> 15:12.289
Kill 'em all. Good riddance.

15:12.493 --> 15:15.246
Did I mention I'm not a man?
I'm a manbot.

15:15.413 --> 15:18.291
Understandable mistake.
You can let me down.

15:18.493 --> 15:23.328
- He big jerk like man.
- Sure, but check the crotch. Nothing.

15:23.533 --> 15:25.046
<i>Very well. Release him.</i>

15:25.213 --> 15:29.764
<i>As for the others, take them</i>
<i>to the snu-snu chambers.</i>

15:42.013 --> 15:45.050
- I'll miss you, meat bag.
- Me too, meat bag.

15:45.213 --> 15:49.570
I never thought I'd die like this,
but I'd always really hoped.

15:49.773 --> 15:52.924
<i>The Amazonians will be divided</i>
<i>into three groups.</i>

15:53.133 --> 15:57.490
<i>The one called Zapp will be</i>
<i>snu-snu'd by the large women.</i>

15:57.693 --> 16:02.687
<i>He that is designated Fry will be</i>
<i>snu-snu'd by the petite women.</i>

16:02.893 --> 16:05.453
<i>And Kif,</i>
<i>as the most attractive male...</i>

16:05.613 --> 16:09.731
<i>... will be snu-snu'd by the most</i>
<i>beautiful women of Amazonia.</i>

16:09.893 --> 16:13.932
<i>Then the large women.</i>
<i>Then the petite women.</i>

16:14.093 --> 16:16.687
<i>Then the large women again.</i>

16:17.173 --> 16:18.970
<i>Initiate snu-snu!</i>

16:21.853 --> 16:27.291
Before I die, I have to tell you I
didn't mean to say those awful things.

16:27.453 --> 16:31.002
- They were all Zapp's idea.
- Really? Honest and true?

16:31.213 --> 16:35.604
Yes. And that person calling
and hanging up was me.

16:35.773 --> 16:39.812
I was just too nervous to say hello
because I love you!

16:40.013 --> 16:41.366
Oh, Kif!

16:41.533 --> 16:45.208
It Og's first time. Be gentle!

16:49.253 --> 16:50.925
We've got to do something.

16:51.093 --> 16:54.529
You can interface with the fem-puter
and reprogram it.

16:54.733 --> 16:58.169
Maybe you can interface with my ass.
By biting it!

17:00.093 --> 17:02.288
All right, I'll go.

17:19.653 --> 17:23.042
- How Tonk look?
- Tonk look good. Me fat.

17:23.213 --> 17:27.126
No, you look good. Tonk fat.

17:33.213 --> 17:36.683
<i>Intruder! Stay away from</i>
<i>the mighty Fem-puter! Guards!</i>

17:36.893 --> 17:41.205
Time to override the CPU
and reprogram this fem-puter.

17:43.053 --> 17:45.726
<i>Stop it. Stop it!</i>
<i>Cut that out.</i>

17:46.933 --> 17:48.844
<i>Cease hitting Fem-puter.</i>

17:49.373 --> 17:52.331
You're no fem-puter,
you're a fembot.

17:52.493 --> 17:57.726
It's true. I disguised myself
so I could rule the Amazonians.

17:57.933 --> 18:01.687
- But why?
- Why? Why?

18:01.853 --> 18:05.129
I came here from a faraway planet.

18:05.293 --> 18:10.048
A planet ruled by a chauvinistic
man-puter that was really a manbot.

18:10.213 --> 18:13.762
Have you any idea how it feels
to be a fembot...

18:13.933 --> 18:18.449
...in a manbot's man-puter's world?
- What?

18:18.653 --> 18:24.011
And now, meddling manbot, there's
the question of what to do with you.

18:34.573 --> 18:38.725
We need rest. The spirit is willing,
but the flesh is spongy and bruised.

18:38.933 --> 18:42.243
- It time snu-snu!
- Can't we just cuddle?

18:42.453 --> 18:44.683
- No!
- Oh.

18:44.973 --> 18:48.329
We can't wait for Bender.
It's time for a woman's touch.

18:57.653 --> 19:01.328
Me next snu-snu! Out me way!

19:02.893 --> 19:07.205
Where go beautiful man?
Me want snu-snu!

19:12.893 --> 19:16.329
- Kif, jump!
- My hero.

19:19.213 --> 19:22.842
Me not get snu-snu. Get him!

19:38.413 --> 19:42.122
Mighty Fem-puter!
Small girl steal green kissy-man.

19:42.293 --> 19:45.922
- We kill her now?
<i>- Come back later. Leave me alone.</i>

19:46.093 --> 19:48.687
<i>Yeah, get lost!</i>

19:53.093 --> 19:57.405
I'm a scary fem-puter.
Release the prisoners.

19:57.613 --> 20:03.131
<i>- And bring gold. Lots of gold.</i>
- Why Fem-puter want gold?

20:03.333 --> 20:05.688
<i>You heard the man.</i>

20:07.693 --> 20:09.649
<i>Come on, give me some of that.</i>

20:11.773 --> 20:17.131
That's how I got my new shell.
It looks just like the one I threw out.

20:17.293 --> 20:22.413
I found it in the same dumpster,
but this one had a live raccoon in it.

20:22.573 --> 20:24.450
Pretty good story, eh?

20:24.653 --> 20:28.009
Stick to someone else,
you windy barnacle!

20:28.213 --> 20:30.966
The battle of the sexes
was only resolved...

20:31.133 --> 20:35.331
...when a manbot and a fembot
realized they loved each other.

20:35.493 --> 20:37.802
By the way, if she calls,
I'm not here.

20:37.973 --> 20:42.489
All I know is, this gold says
that was the best mission ever.

20:43.493 --> 20:45.529
- It sure was.
- Oh, yeah.

20:45.693 --> 20:48.253
I had snu-snu.

20:48.453 --> 20:53.368
So, Amy?
What do you want to do now?
