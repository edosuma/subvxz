00:20.904 --> 00:23.038
Faster, faster,
you beast!

00:23.039 --> 00:24.907
This is as fast
as it goes, Gene.

00:24.908 --> 00:26.175
It has a messed-up wheel.

00:26.176 --> 00:27.993
And a lot of junk
in the trunk.

00:27.994 --> 00:29.161
More to push.

00:29.162 --> 00:30.879
Yes, Gene.
You love it.

00:30.880 --> 00:33.499
Beep-beep!
Here we are in Turkey Town.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.200
Oh, hello there.

00:35.201 --> 00:36.835
Which one
of you lucky fellas wants

00:36.836 --> 00:39.321
to get eaten by me
this Thursday?

00:39.322 --> 00:40.889
Me! No, me!

00:40.890 --> 00:42.658
Okay, settle down everyone.

00:42.659 --> 00:44.493
So Dad's talking
to turkeys now?

00:44.494 --> 00:46.528
Sheesh, Dad.
Get an oven.

00:46.529 --> 00:47.997
Your dad loves Thanksgiving.

00:47.998 --> 00:49.264
It's his favorite holiday.

00:49.265 --> 00:50.916
Will it be you?
You're a big one.

00:50.917 --> 00:52.618
- You been working out?
- A little.

00:52.619 --> 00:54.019
Well, you look great.

00:54.020 --> 00:55.354
Yeah, it's a little weird,

00:55.355 --> 00:57.056
but it's his selection process.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.524
It's like The Bachelor,

00:58.525 --> 01:00.292
but at the end,
the one he chooses gets eaten.

01:00.293 --> 01:02.194
That's what happens
on the real Bachelor, too.

01:02.195 --> 01:03.862
They just don't show it
on camera.

01:03.863 --> 01:05.597
Hey Bob, what about me?

01:05.598 --> 01:07.850
Oh, yeah.
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

01:07.851 --> 01:10.219
I hope he waits to get it home
before he stuffs it.

01:10.220 --> 01:12.037
Yes... Yes, it's you.

01:12.038 --> 01:13.706
Really?

01:13.707 --> 01:15.107
Really.

01:15.108 --> 01:16.408
Hey, thank you so much.

01:16.409 --> 01:17.910
I don't know what to say.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.278
It's okay, don't say anything.

01:19.279 --> 01:20.278
Oh, Bob.

01:20.280 --> 01:21.947
Dad, are you crying?

01:21.948 --> 01:23.582
Shh! Let them
have their moment.

01:23.583 --> 01:24.700
Yes!

01:24.701 --> 01:26.201
Come on.
Let's go get stuffing.

01:26.202 --> 01:27.870
Come on.
You're the one!

01:27.871 --> 01:30.939
Come on!
You are the one!

01:30.940 --> 01:33.042
That turkey
is our mom now.

01:37.781 --> 01:38.981
Uh, Mr. Fischoeder.

01:38.982 --> 01:40.599
Um, it's not December yet.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.434
And I, I paid November's rent
a few days ago.

01:42.435 --> 01:44.069
I know I used a lot
of pennies, but...

01:44.070 --> 01:46.488
Stand down, Bob.
I'm just here as a friend.

01:46.489 --> 01:48.590
A friend who needs to borrow
your family for Thanksgiving.

01:48.591 --> 01:50.242
What?
I need to borrow

01:50.243 --> 01:52.811
your family
for Thanksgiving dinner.

01:52.812 --> 01:54.913
Why?
Bob, have you ever been in love?

01:54.914 --> 01:57.082
I-I guess.
I-I technically am.

01:57.083 --> 01:58.283
Hi!

01:58.284 --> 02:00.319
Well, Bob,
I was in love once, too.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.520
Oh, sick!

02:01.521 --> 02:03.155
With Shelby Schnabel,

02:03.156 --> 02:05.824
the most famous sharpshooter
since Annie Oakley.

02:05.825 --> 02:08.594
You lost me at "love" but brought
me back with "sharpshooter."

02:08.595 --> 02:11.130
She left me
for a married oil magnate.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.832
Then she left him for a
married movie magnate.

02:13.833 --> 02:15.434
She's a magnate magnet.

02:15.435 --> 02:16.769
More like a homewrecker.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.504
Exactly, which is why I need

02:18.505 --> 02:20.305
to give her a home to wreck.

02:20.306 --> 02:21.774
If you want to wreck your home,

02:21.775 --> 02:23.876
buy a bunch of mice,
like a normal person.

02:23.877 --> 02:26.979
So, Bob, in exchange
for one month's rent,

02:26.980 --> 02:29.615
can your family pretend
to be my family?

02:29.616 --> 02:31.300
Yay! Acting!

02:31.301 --> 02:32.701
Mmm... no.

02:32.702 --> 02:34.703
From now on,
call me Gene Fischoeder.

02:34.704 --> 02:36.705
No wait,
Vesuvio Fischoeder.

02:36.706 --> 02:38.557
No, wait, Alabama Slammer!

02:38.558 --> 02:40.025
I'll need you, too, Bob,

02:40.026 --> 02:41.860
to pose as my cook
and to roast the bird.

02:41.861 --> 02:43.362
Definitely not.
Thanksgiving is

02:43.363 --> 02:45.063
this family's
favorite holiday.

02:45.064 --> 02:46.665
Eh.
Wait, it's not?

02:46.666 --> 02:48.133
No way.
Check the rankings.

02:48.134 --> 02:51.036
my birthday,
Christmas, Halloween...

02:51.037 --> 02:52.504
Easter...
Hanukkah...

02:52.505 --> 02:53.839
Snow Day,
Amateur Night...

02:53.840 --> 02:55.073
Uh, okay, that's...

02:55.074 --> 02:56.875
Veterans Day...
Tooth Fairy Eve...

02:56.876 --> 02:59.077
Not real.
Patrick's Day, May Day,

02:59.078 --> 03:01.079
Groundhog Day, season premiere
of Game of Thrones...

03:01.080 --> 03:03.482
You've never even seen...
Opposite Day, Day of the Dead...

03:03.483 --> 03:05.717
Stop.
Dawn of the Dead, Carnivale...

03:05.718 --> 03:07.519
Angela Lansbury's birthday...

03:07.520 --> 03:08.554
No.
Bath Night...

03:08.555 --> 03:09.738
Black Friday,

03:09.739 --> 03:11.039
then Thanksgiving.

03:11.040 --> 03:12.341
Love Black Friday.

03:12.342 --> 03:14.143
Black Friday before
Thanksgiving?

03:14.144 --> 03:15.844
Yeah, 'cause it's dark.

03:15.845 --> 03:17.146
Oh, come on guys, what about

03:17.147 --> 03:18.647
all of our Thanksgiving
traditions?

03:18.648 --> 03:20.182
Gene and I always play football.

03:20.183 --> 03:21.416
Always go for the feet.

03:21.417 --> 03:22.501
Ow!

03:22.502 --> 03:24.269
Tina and I break the wishbone.

03:24.270 --> 03:26.338
I wished for
more wishbones.

03:26.339 --> 03:28.073
And Louise, we use the giblets

03:28.074 --> 03:30.342
to play Turkey Crime Scene
Miami.

03:30.343 --> 03:32.728
Cause of
death is a missing head.

03:32.729 --> 03:34.062
Same as last year.

03:34.063 --> 03:35.397
Same as every year.

03:35.398 --> 03:37.566
We've got a serial killer
on our hands!

03:37.567 --> 03:40.736
But everyone's favorite part
is my funny toast, right?

03:40.737 --> 03:42.171
Like, last year, I said,

03:42.172 --> 03:44.406
if you want to open
the door to this family,

03:44.407 --> 03:45.707
use the tur-key!

03:45.708 --> 03:47.543
Tur...

03:47.544 --> 03:48.710
Oh, my gosh.

03:48.711 --> 03:50.012
I just got it.

03:50.013 --> 03:51.413
Let's up the ante.

03:51.414 --> 03:52.514
Three months rent.

03:52.515 --> 03:53.549
Bobby.

03:53.550 --> 03:54.917
Two.
Gene, no.

03:54.918 --> 03:56.285
Purple. What are we guessing?

03:56.286 --> 03:58.187
Five.
Deal.

03:58.188 --> 04:00.856
Wow, I didn't think you
were gonna go... Okay.

04:00.857 --> 04:02.224
Uh... well, that'll make
a huge difference for us.

04:02.225 --> 04:03.892
That's-that's like real money.

04:03.893 --> 04:05.961
Goodie. I'll send you
all scripts for Thursday.

04:05.962 --> 04:07.896
I want you to really get
into your parts.

04:07.897 --> 04:09.865
Just like I'm going to get
into Shelby's parts.

04:09.866 --> 04:10.933
Her lady parts.

04:10.934 --> 04:12.234
Which are the lady parts?

04:12.235 --> 04:14.069
The vagina and the heart.

04:15.939 --> 04:18.373
I can't believe
my bridesmaid's dress

04:18.374 --> 04:20.442
from Ginger's wedding
still fits me.

04:20.442 --> 04:22.127
You look like
an elegant sausage.

04:22.128 --> 04:24.563
I hope I can breathe
to do my Thanksgiving song.

04:24.564 --> 04:26.398
I thought we
settled on no song.

04:26.399 --> 04:28.100
I hate plays
that don't have songs.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.768
I'll find a place to fit it in.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.236
What's your Thanksgiving song?

04:31.237 --> 04:32.604
Uh, no, no, no, no, no.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.573
♪ Pass the cranberry sauce

04:34.574 --> 04:36.325
♪ We're having mashed potatoes

04:36.326 --> 04:38.076
♪ Ooh, the turkey looks great
Lin...

04:38.077 --> 04:39.595
♪ Thank you for loving me
Lin.

04:39.596 --> 04:41.330
♪ Thank you for being there
Oh, God.

04:41.331 --> 04:42.965
♪ Everyone's thankin'
Lin.

04:42.966 --> 04:44.750
♪ The whole world's
thankin' you ♪

04:44.751 --> 04:46.468
Stop, Lin. Stop.
♪ Thankin' us for thankin' you

04:46.469 --> 04:47.786
Lin.
♪ Kill the turkey.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.154
Please.
I liked it.

04:49.155 --> 04:50.572
Thank you.

04:50.573 --> 04:51.740
Okay, everyone, we're here.

04:51.741 --> 04:53.008
Listen, I figured out

04:53.009 --> 04:54.610
how to have
our own Thanksgiving,

04:54.611 --> 04:56.845
stuffed inside
Fischoeder's Thanksgiving.

04:56.846 --> 04:58.146
Like a turducken.

04:58.147 --> 04:59.681
A poultry
within a poultry.

04:59.682 --> 05:01.917
It's like Inception,
with meats.

05:01.918 --> 05:03.452
Gene, before dinner,
you come in

05:03.453 --> 05:05.087
and we'll play tackle
in the kitchen.

05:05.088 --> 05:06.688
Then send Tina in
for the wishbone.

05:06.689 --> 05:07.823
And then Louise.

05:07.824 --> 05:09.191
And at exactly 8:00,

05:09.192 --> 05:10.993
you all say you have to go
to the bathroom

05:10.994 --> 05:12.828
and then you come
to the kitchen for my toast.

05:12.829 --> 05:14.529
8:00... that's your cue.

05:14.530 --> 05:15.797
I'm only half listening.

05:15.798 --> 05:17.266
Did you just say you want us

05:17.267 --> 05:18.667
to go to the bathroom
in the kitchen?

05:18.668 --> 05:20.502
No, Louise.
Come on, guys,

05:20.503 --> 05:21.870
"Belcher Thanksgiving"
on three, ready?

05:21.871 --> 05:22.938
One, two...

05:22.939 --> 05:24.139
Ah, the Fischoeders!

05:24.140 --> 05:26.608
Come inside, family.

05:26.609 --> 05:28.010
Yay.

05:28.011 --> 05:29.778
Okay, uh...

05:29.779 --> 05:31.113
You guys go.

05:31.114 --> 05:32.781
I'm still excited.

05:35.218 --> 05:36.618
Uh, can-can you open the door?

05:36.619 --> 05:38.053
Go around the back, cook.

05:38.054 --> 05:40.022
Okay.
Still gonna be good.

05:41.988 --> 05:43.188
This house was originally built

05:43.189 --> 05:46.024
by a paranoid
arsenic manufacturer.

05:46.025 --> 05:49.428
Oh, I bet there are actual
skeletons in these closets.

05:49.429 --> 05:51.496
And a dungeon full
of Dungeness crabs.

05:51.497 --> 05:53.030
I bet when you flush
the toilets,

05:53.031 --> 05:55.400
the water evaporates upwards
and forms a rainbow.

05:55.401 --> 05:56.868
Two of you are correct.

05:56.869 --> 05:59.237
You already signed
your liability waivers,

05:59.238 --> 06:00.906
so go explore.

06:00.907 --> 06:02.341
Awesome!

06:02.342 --> 06:04.443
So, Mr. Fisch...

06:04.444 --> 06:06.578
I was right
about the toilets.

06:06.579 --> 06:10.515
Huh, I thought the kitchen
would be more, uh, mansion-y.

06:10.516 --> 06:12.751
Mansions are for the owners,
Bob, not the cooks.

06:12.752 --> 06:14.953
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going get drunk for dinner.

06:14.954 --> 06:16.755
Do you mean dressed?
Dressed out of my mind.

06:16.756 --> 06:18.090
Got to loosen up,
you know?

06:18.091 --> 06:20.792
Right, right.
Got to get my sex face on.

06:20.793 --> 06:22.861
I can't wait to see it.

06:22.862 --> 06:24.763
Well, Lin, this might not
be so bad, right?

06:24.764 --> 06:25.763
This Thanksgiving.

06:25.765 --> 06:26.898
Neh.
What?

06:26.899 --> 06:28.200
My hair!

06:28.201 --> 06:30.552
Now I got to go redo it. Great.
Fine.

06:30.553 --> 06:32.571
Guess I'll just be here, alone.

06:32.572 --> 06:33.972
With uh... with the turkey.

06:33.973 --> 06:35.807
My name's Lance.

06:35.808 --> 06:37.409
Sorry. With Lance.

06:37.410 --> 06:38.610
How are you, Lance?

06:38.611 --> 06:39.911
Pretty great.

06:39.912 --> 06:42.381
Oh, there are
my little Fischies.

06:42.382 --> 06:43.899
Thanks for
the new outfits.

06:43.900 --> 06:45.884
Sometimes you need
a make-under.

06:45.885 --> 06:46.985
I'm glad you like them.

06:46.986 --> 06:48.253
Now, our job tonight

06:48.254 --> 06:49.955
is to fool the woman
of my dreams

06:49.956 --> 06:51.890
into believing
that we are a loving,

06:51.891 --> 06:55.260
happy nuclear family
that she can destroy.

06:55.261 --> 06:56.260
Romantic.

06:56.262 --> 06:57.929
In order to keep
you kids motivated,

06:57.930 --> 06:59.998
we're going to be playing
by arcade rules.

06:59.999 --> 07:01.600
You'll be awarded these tickets

07:01.601 --> 07:04.669
for convincing performances
as Fischoeder children.

07:04.670 --> 07:06.271
Game on.
Wait, time out.

07:06.272 --> 07:07.739
Okay, game on again.

07:07.740 --> 07:09.491
I thought my shoe
was untied.

07:09.492 --> 07:11.693
The one with the most tickets
at the end of the evening

07:11.694 --> 07:13.762
can claim a gift
from my prize room.

07:13.763 --> 07:16.598
The only prize I need
is your love, father.

07:16.599 --> 07:18.033
And we're off and running.

07:19.168 --> 07:20.702
And just like
every happy family,

07:20.703 --> 07:22.938
we now have a commissioned
painng otius,

07:22.939 --> 07:24.473
holding the family crest

07:24.474 --> 07:26.875
covered in ten schlongs,

07:26.876 --> 07:28.944
which of course
is German for "snakes."

07:28.945 --> 07:30.145
Oh-ho-ho.

07:30.146 --> 07:31.313
Look at the schlongs.

07:32.348 --> 07:33.515
Oh, she's here!

07:33.516 --> 07:35.050
She's here! Oh, God.

07:35.051 --> 07:37.619
Ooh, I'm so nervous.
Places, people! Places!

07:37.620 --> 07:39.037
Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh.

07:41.524 --> 07:42.858
You ready for the oven?

07:42.859 --> 07:44.126
I dunno, Bob.

07:44.127 --> 07:45.160
It feels weird.

07:45.161 --> 07:46.795
We should be doing this at home.

07:46.796 --> 07:50.532
I know it's not the same,
but it can still be fun.

07:50.533 --> 07:51.566
Why don't you take a sip

07:51.567 --> 07:52.634
of that over there, Bob?

07:52.635 --> 07:53.902
That?

07:53.903 --> 07:55.470
Yeah, that green bottle.

07:55.471 --> 07:56.972
It's, uh, absinthe.

07:56.973 --> 07:58.540
Doesn't this
make you hallucinate?

07:58.541 --> 08:00.008
Carpe diem!

08:00.009 --> 08:01.409
- What?
- Seize the day.

08:01.410 --> 08:03.044
All right,
I'll take a little sip.

08:03.045 --> 08:04.880
This can't be that bad.

08:07.850 --> 08:10.085
Whoa. Weird.

08:10.086 --> 08:12.654
Bob! Bob! Bob!

08:12.655 --> 08:14.389
What?

08:14.390 --> 08:16.691
Can you leave
the oven light on for me?

08:16.692 --> 08:17.859
I get scared.

08:17.860 --> 08:19.261
So cute.

08:19.262 --> 08:20.562
Here's the light.

08:20.563 --> 08:21.763
It's too bright.

08:21.764 --> 08:24.733
Shelby, may I present
my wife, Linda.

08:24.734 --> 08:26.034
Pleasure to meet you, Linda.

08:26.035 --> 08:28.170
Oh, I like that name,
Linda.

08:28.171 --> 08:29.604
And I'm Linda.

08:29.605 --> 08:31.106
Moving right along,
these are my children,

08:31.107 --> 08:33.875
Gina, Team, and Lucy.

08:33.876 --> 08:35.577
Welcome to our happy home.

08:35.578 --> 08:38.446
Any ex-lover of my father's
is a friend of mine.

08:38.447 --> 08:40.248
What unusual children.

08:40.249 --> 08:42.784
Calvin, your sperm
did wonderfully.

08:42.784 --> 08:44.703
She took my sperm
and ran with it.

08:44.704 --> 08:46.004
Because I'm his...

08:46.005 --> 08:47.189
Because I...

08:47.190 --> 08:48.723
Because I'm his wife.

08:48.724 --> 08:51.409
Thank you, Linda.
Say, do you kids like bullets?

08:51.410 --> 08:53.378
I think all kids like bullets.
Think fast!

08:53.379 --> 08:55.013
Whoa! Whoa. Wow!

08:55.014 --> 08:56.381
Calvin, you kept

08:56.382 --> 08:57.516
my old rifle.

08:57.517 --> 08:58.717
You weren't carrying a torch

08:58.718 --> 09:00.685
for me all these years,
were you?

09:00.686 --> 09:03.421
Oh, of course not, I was just holding
it for you. You can have it back.

09:03.422 --> 09:06.458
You don't mind if I cock
this thing in here, do you?

09:06.459 --> 09:07.459
Cock away.

09:09.045 --> 09:11.029
Ow! Loud!

09:11.030 --> 09:13.398
That trick's called
the "Reverse Cowgirl."

09:13.399 --> 09:15.534
I bet you could pierce
Gene's ear from there.

09:15.535 --> 09:16.902
Ooh, do my belly button!

09:16.903 --> 09:18.103
Not till you're 18.

09:18.104 --> 09:19.654
If you teach me to shoot,

09:19.655 --> 09:21.289
I'll teach you to regret
teaching me to shoot.

09:21.290 --> 09:22.791
And I can teach you
to make burgers,

09:22.792 --> 09:24.042
like in our restau...

09:24.043 --> 09:25.927
Eh, eh!
What is she talking about?

09:25.928 --> 09:27.979
All this talk about shooting
is making me thirsty.

09:27.980 --> 09:30.282
Why don't we pull the
trigger on a glass of wine?

09:30.283 --> 09:31.883
Ha-ha. I'm funny.

09:31.884 --> 09:33.285
I'm his funny wife.

09:33.286 --> 09:36.121
Being a family man
suits you, Calvin.

09:36.122 --> 09:38.290
Hmm. You look better
than I remember.

09:38.291 --> 09:39.925
When will Thanksgiving be over?

09:39.926 --> 09:43.061
I want it to be Father's Day
every day!

09:43.062 --> 09:44.612
Very nice.
Here, Father,

09:44.613 --> 09:46.114
let me refill your glass.

09:46.115 --> 09:48.316
You must be dehydrated
from being so wonderful.

09:48.317 --> 09:49.784
Take it down a notch or two.

09:49.785 --> 09:51.653
Hey, Dad,
remember when we did that thing

09:51.654 --> 09:53.288
that was fun and memorable?

09:53.289 --> 09:54.789
That's pathetic.

09:54.790 --> 09:57.125
Um, hello,
I'm your chef.

09:57.126 --> 09:59.261
Yes, this is our chef,
uh, Burt.

09:59.262 --> 10:02.097
Here are your salads,
and now I will, uh,

10:02.098 --> 10:04.032
go tackle the turkey.
Did you hear that, Gene?

10:04.033 --> 10:05.767
I'm gonna go
tackle the turkey.

10:05.768 --> 10:07.002
Tackle away.

10:07.003 --> 10:08.603
Tackle the turkey.

10:08.604 --> 10:10.338
Ah!
Ow.

10:11.591 --> 10:13.024
Oh!
That was a great shot.

10:13.025 --> 10:14.626
Really, really funny.

10:14.627 --> 10:16.828
Do another one.
Ooh! Do a crouton.

10:16.829 --> 10:19.164
Uh, no, I'm gonna go back
to the kitchen now.

10:19.165 --> 10:21.132
So, uh, here I go.

10:21.133 --> 10:22.667
Back to the kitchen.

10:22.668 --> 10:24.536
Gene, go apologize to the cook.

10:25.705 --> 10:26.871
Gene!

10:26.872 --> 10:28.473
Buddy, football time.

10:28.474 --> 10:30.375
Let the traditions begin.

10:30.376 --> 10:31.843
Let's make this quick.

10:31.844 --> 10:33.612
All right, I got the ball
on the one yard line

10:33.613 --> 10:36.047
Hut, one! Hut, two!

10:36.048 --> 10:38.049
Hut, hut, hut, hike!

10:38.050 --> 10:39.501
Ow.

10:39.502 --> 10:40.802
Great game, Dad,
hit the showers.

10:40.803 --> 10:42.170
But we barely played.

10:42.171 --> 10:43.805
Gotta get out there
and get more tickets.

10:43.806 --> 10:45.240
Tickets?
What are you talking about?

10:45.241 --> 10:47.409
I don't have time
to explain this to the help.

10:47.410 --> 10:49.644
Fine, just send Tina in.

10:49.645 --> 10:50.745
And come back for my toast!

10:50.746 --> 10:52.314
You got it, Buddy.

10:52.315 --> 10:54.399
One for me...

10:54.400 --> 10:56.735
and one for Bob.

10:56.736 --> 10:58.670
I'm very good at drinking this.
Thank you.

10:58.671 --> 11:00.338
There's my girl!

11:00.339 --> 11:01.973
Okay, time to break
the wishbone, right?

11:01.974 --> 11:03.675
Oh, crap,
it's still in the turkey.

11:03.676 --> 11:07.012
Well, maybe we can just
pull it out a little early.

11:07.013 --> 11:10.015
Ow! Oh, my God,
that's hot!

11:10.016 --> 11:11.883
Got some skin!

11:11.884 --> 11:14.552
Okay, you grab your end
and let's do the wish-skin.

11:14.553 --> 11:16.488
Um, okay.

11:16.489 --> 11:18.356
Great, you won!
Yay.

11:18.357 --> 11:20.492
What'd you wish for,
more wish-skins?

11:20.493 --> 11:22.027
More tickets.

11:22.028 --> 11:23.395
I'm way behind in the
best kid contest.

11:23.396 --> 11:25.230
Oh. So you're gonna leave?

11:25.231 --> 11:26.881
I'll send Louise in.

11:29.018 --> 11:33.254
Louise Belcher regrets to
inform you she cannot attend

11:33.255 --> 11:35.857
Miami due
to a prior comtmenmi

11:35.858 --> 11:39.627
Oh, great, I guess I did all
this for nothing. Ugh!

11:39.628 --> 11:42.063
Remember, Bob,
it's all an act.

11:42.064 --> 11:43.948
Thanks, Lance, you've been
my rock through all this.

11:43.949 --> 11:45.633
I love you.

11:45.634 --> 11:49.537
Well, it's almost 8:00,
so I'll do my toast,

11:49.538 --> 11:52.707
and the Belcher Thanksgiving
will be back on track.

11:52.708 --> 11:55.527
I "yam" what I "yam."

11:55.528 --> 11:58.596
And what I "yam" is
the luckiest man in the world.

11:58.597 --> 11:59.914
Yeah!

11:59.915 --> 12:02.067
Was that a great toast or what?

12:02.068 --> 12:04.769
You're the toastest
with the mostest.

12:04.770 --> 12:06.037
Mwah!

12:06.038 --> 12:07.037
Aw...

12:07.039 --> 12:08.707
Family!

12:08.708 --> 12:10.241
Thanksgiving...!

12:13.095 --> 12:15.663
Lance, you're big.

12:15.664 --> 12:17.432
Mm-hmm!

12:41.257 --> 12:42.590
Oh!

12:57.656 --> 13:00.125
This is weird, right?

13:01.660 --> 13:03.828
Oh, my God!

13:03.829 --> 13:05.463
What? What's going on?

13:05.464 --> 13:07.532
It's 8:35! My toast!

13:10.136 --> 13:13.972
Oh, Fischoeder Dad,
you are hilarious!

13:13.973 --> 13:15.607
They're not coming, Bob.

13:15.608 --> 13:18.960
Yeah, I know, Lance.

13:23.929 --> 13:25.396
Ow! My face!

13:25.397 --> 13:27.398
Bobby, I need
a chopped onion... stat!

13:27.399 --> 13:29.066
No one came in
for my toast, Lin.

13:29.067 --> 13:30.267
My big toast.

13:30.268 --> 13:32.503
You can do your toast
for us tomorrow.

13:32.504 --> 13:33.938
Tomorrow's not
Thanksgiving.

13:33.939 --> 13:35.739
But tomorrow we'll have
five months free rent.

13:35.740 --> 13:37.575
Because this is working...
I think.

13:37.576 --> 13:40.778
Now come on, I need an onion
so I can cry for my next scene.

13:40.779 --> 13:42.546
- Chop-chop!  Get it? Fine.
- You don't want

13:42.547 --> 13:45.416
to come in here for my toast,
I'll bring it out there.

13:45.417 --> 13:46.951
No, you will not, mister.

13:46.952 --> 13:48.619
I haven't even done
my song yet.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.187
I'm coming out, Lin.

13:50.188 --> 13:52.389
Bob, you are drunk.

13:52.390 --> 13:54.208
You're drunk.

13:54.209 --> 13:57.111
I am not. I've only had half
of four bottles of wine.

13:57.112 --> 14:00.114
Just bring the turkey out
and you can come back in here

14:00.115 --> 14:03.017
and take a nap on the floor
like you do at home, okay?

14:03.018 --> 14:05.419
Now, let's go!

14:17.883 --> 14:18.983
- Thank you.
- All right!

14:18.984 --> 14:21.385
Thank you.
That was called

14:21.386 --> 14:23.587
Bravo!

14:23.588 --> 14:25.890
And this is called
"Better Ode To Dad."

14:25.891 --> 14:27.274
Get ready!

14:31.046 --> 14:32.613
I can't compete with that.

14:32.614 --> 14:34.315
You know, I am
so emotional.

14:34.316 --> 14:37.585
What a wonderful...
family we have.

14:37.586 --> 14:38.886
And it's...
Hmm.

14:38.887 --> 14:41.088
It almost,
it brings tears to my eyes. Hmm.

14:41.089 --> 14:42.088
Just a second...

14:42.090 --> 14:44.892
You're doing great mom.

14:44.893 --> 14:46.393
Really natural.

14:47.729 --> 14:51.065
Oh, you are
so married.

14:51.066 --> 14:53.033
So gosh damn married!

14:53.034 --> 14:56.303
Hello, it's me,
the cook, Bob...

14:56.304 --> 14:58.472
Or Burt.
And this is Lance.

14:58.473 --> 14:59.974
Lance is a turkey.

14:59.975 --> 15:01.775
Lance, these are the jerks
I mentioned

15:01.776 --> 15:03.577
in the kitchen, when
I was talking to you.

15:03.578 --> 15:06.113
He seems like he's in
a good place.

15:06.114 --> 15:07.681
So, without further ado,

15:07.682 --> 15:10.284
I will now give the traditional
cook's toast

15:10.285 --> 15:12.252
that I do every year.

15:12.253 --> 15:14.788
Uh, maybe
you should go back

15:14.789 --> 15:16.423
into the kitchen,
Mr. Cook.

15:16.424 --> 15:18.692
Oh, shut up, Mrs. Fischoeder!

15:18.693 --> 15:20.327
Uh, ah, okay.

15:20.328 --> 15:22.830
Wow, there must be five
months of dishes to do in there.

15:22.831 --> 15:24.999
You don't want to sleep in
the basement again, Mr. Cook.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.301
Are you still talking?!

15:27.302 --> 15:28.869
You don't want
to sleep without...

15:28.870 --> 15:31.171
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!
Oh, dear!

15:31.172 --> 15:34.341
It's Thanksgiving again,
and there's some "stuff-ing"

15:34.342 --> 15:35.809
I'm thankful for.

15:35.810 --> 15:38.045
♪ Go on and pass
the cranberries... ♪

15:38.046 --> 15:39.513
Don't, Lin, don't!

15:39.514 --> 15:41.949
♪ It's time to sing
a little song now. ♪

15:41.950 --> 15:43.050
Stop it! Stop!

15:43.051 --> 15:44.785
Wow, this is
getting good.

15:44.786 --> 15:47.554
- All right...
- Thanksgiving.

15:48.857 --> 15:50.157
Let's break
the word down.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.458
Let me, uh, just...
Thanks.

15:51.459 --> 15:53.027
Shh. Excuse me.
Sorry.

15:53.028 --> 15:55.062
I've heard people use
that word quite often.

15:55.063 --> 15:57.681
Up here. Let me just "pumpkin" you
up by saying... Or "than" than.

15:57.682 --> 15:59.516
"pumpkin you up,"
right?

15:59.517 --> 16:01.885
Like "we have more than" day!
Let's raise our glasses.

16:01.886 --> 16:05.356
Yes, raise your glasses.
Tina, raise drop those glasses.

16:05.357 --> 16:07.024
Raise them higher than that.

16:07.025 --> 16:09.693
♪ Oh, pass the cranberry!

16:09.694 --> 16:11.311
All right.
Shut up, Lin!

16:11.312 --> 16:13.080
♪ Let's get a little lazy

16:13.081 --> 16:14.982
Here's my toast,
and what I say goes.

16:14.983 --> 16:16.684
Me?
We'll go by applause.

16:16.685 --> 16:20.020
Everyone who liked the cook's
toast best... Shh! Clap now!

16:21.990 --> 16:24.658
I don't need clapping.
What I need is

16:24.659 --> 16:25.893
what every dad
needs, hugging!

16:25.894 --> 16:28.595
Uh, kids, go hug your dad.

16:28.596 --> 16:30.164
Come on.

16:30.165 --> 16:33.851
No, your dad,
your Fischoeder dad.

16:33.852 --> 16:35.386
Unbelievable.

16:35.387 --> 16:38.555
Wife, come!
Oh, yes!

16:38.556 --> 16:40.441
Ah-ha, ha-ha.

16:40.442 --> 16:42.342
It's working.
Let's seal the deal.

16:42.343 --> 16:43.894
No, no.
Give me those lips.

16:43.895 --> 16:45.429
No... no...
Lips. Lips.

16:45.430 --> 16:46.697
No, no.
Lips. Lips.

16:46.698 --> 16:47.815
Okay, one.

16:48.824 --> 16:50.384
Whoa. Sick! Aw...

16:50.385 --> 16:51.952
Get your lips off her!

16:51.953 --> 16:53.854
Wow!
Everybody wants everybody!

16:53.855 --> 16:55.689
This is so exciting.

16:55.690 --> 16:57.791
I believe the cook has had
too much to drink.

16:57.792 --> 16:59.359
Oh, do you believe it?!

16:59.360 --> 17:01.295
I believe it in my
heart of hearts.

17:01.296 --> 17:03.230
Oh, great, everyone wants
to hear your beliefs!

17:03.231 --> 17:05.049
Back to the kitchen now!

17:05.050 --> 17:06.150
I'm not going back.

17:06.151 --> 17:08.085
Now this is a holiday.

17:08.086 --> 17:10.237
Is it cool if I grab a leg?
No.

17:10.238 --> 17:12.705
You people don't deserve
to eat Lance.

17:12.707 --> 17:16.242
Lance is my friend, okay?

17:16.243 --> 17:17.944
Ow, Lance,
you're burning my arm.

17:17.945 --> 17:19.213
Put that turkey down.

17:19.214 --> 17:21.999
I pay your salary
and your rent.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.384
Keep your blood money,
Fischoeder!

17:24.385 --> 17:25.502
Bobby, come back!

17:25.502 --> 17:26.637
Not the gravy!

17:26.637 --> 17:28.071
Save me some dark meat!

17:28.073 --> 17:29.573
Lance, take care of my father!

17:29.574 --> 17:31.408
Get back here with that turkey!

17:31.409 --> 17:32.509
I'll get it back.

17:32.510 --> 17:33.877
I love a turkey hunt.

17:33.878 --> 17:35.510
Wait. What?

17:37.422 --> 17:39.757
They'll never catch us! Let's hide here.
There he is!

17:39.758 --> 17:40.891
Oh, boy.

17:40.892 --> 17:41.891
Duck, Bob, duck!

17:41.893 --> 17:43.611
You're a turkey, Lance.

17:43.612 --> 17:45.613
Good one, Bob.

17:45.614 --> 17:46.881
They're gaining on us!

17:46.882 --> 17:48.082
Run side to side!

17:48.083 --> 17:50.551
Okay, but I think
this is slower.

17:50.552 --> 17:52.186
Shelby, stop!
Don't shoot him!

17:52.187 --> 17:53.854
What the...?

17:53.855 --> 17:56.390
Come back here with
our turkey, cook!

17:56.391 --> 17:58.359
Never! He's mine!

17:58.360 --> 17:59.743
No, don't shoot
my dad!

17:59.744 --> 18:01.796
I'm not.
I'm gonna shoot the cook!

18:01.797 --> 18:04.115
And I won't kill him.
I'm just gonna maim him!

18:04.116 --> 18:05.115
Tackle!

18:09.654 --> 18:11.288
Oh, God,
we killed Bobby!

18:11.289 --> 18:12.790
We killed Bobby!
Dad!

18:12.791 --> 18:15.042
Why do they keep
calling the cook "Dad"?

18:18.213 --> 18:19.880
Lin, he's shot.

18:19.881 --> 18:21.048
Oh, thank goodness.
Oh, my God.

18:21.049 --> 18:22.583
Dad!
Dad!

18:22.584 --> 18:23.784
Lance, talk to me.

18:23.785 --> 18:25.653
You're gonna be okay.

18:25.654 --> 18:28.489
No, no I'm not
gonna make it, Bob.

18:28.490 --> 18:31.092
Don't say that, Lance.
Don't talk like that!

18:31.093 --> 18:32.827
You're gonna be fine!

18:32.828 --> 18:35.463
No, I'm cold. I'm so cold.

18:35.464 --> 18:37.798
Get him a blanket!
Get him a blanket!

18:39.301 --> 18:41.902
What?
What's he sayin'?

18:41.903 --> 18:43.604
I don't know.
I can't understand.

18:43.605 --> 18:46.340
What's he sayin'?!
He's just murmuring!

18:46.341 --> 18:49.076
Lance? Lance?

18:49.077 --> 18:50.411
Oh, he's gone!!

18:50.412 --> 18:52.663
Oh, Bobby, I'm so sorry
about all this.

18:52.664 --> 18:54.265
I never want
to be someone else's wife,

18:54.266 --> 18:55.599
even for pretend.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.268
Sorry we ruined your
Thanksgiving, Dad.

18:57.269 --> 18:58.769
We were jerks.

18:58.770 --> 19:00.171
I'm sorry, too.

19:00.172 --> 19:01.972
I promise to tackle
you every day

19:01.973 --> 19:04.108
for the rest
of my life.

19:04.109 --> 19:06.811
I've been talking to a turkey
for a long time now.

19:06.812 --> 19:09.947
But I drank a lot of
absinthe, just to be fair.

19:09.948 --> 19:12.516
Oh, Bobby, come here.
Mwah!

19:12.517 --> 19:13.884
Lin, not now, I'm grieving.

19:13.885 --> 19:15.719
I lost a friend today.

19:15.720 --> 19:17.721
This is so confusing!

19:17.722 --> 19:19.840
Well, it's clear to me
that this cook has, uh,

19:19.841 --> 19:22.827
fathered these, uh,
children with, uh, this...

19:22.828 --> 19:24.395
Oh, give it up.

19:24.396 --> 19:26.464
I'm not Fischoeder's
wife, all right?

19:26.465 --> 19:28.833
He hired us to pretend
to be his family

19:28.834 --> 19:30.534
so you'd be attracted
to him... there.

19:30.535 --> 19:32.069
I'm touched that
you would go

19:32.070 --> 19:35.039
to so much trouble
for little old me.

19:35.040 --> 19:38.008
Oh, you're not old,
and you're not little.

19:38.009 --> 19:39.210
Not where it counts.

19:39.211 --> 19:40.644
In the wabba-wabba.

19:40.645 --> 19:43.481
Oh, Calvin,
this isn't gonna work.

19:43.482 --> 19:44.481
Oh.

19:44.483 --> 19:46.650
I respect myself too much

19:46.651 --> 19:48.586
not to be the other woman.

19:48.587 --> 19:49.987
Wow, you guys are insane.

19:49.988 --> 19:51.255
Let's get out of here.

19:51.256 --> 19:52.857
We can still have dinner
at home.

19:52.858 --> 19:53.924
Wait!
I almost forgot!

19:53.925 --> 19:55.493
I have the
most tickets!

19:55.494 --> 19:58.229
And I know exactly what I want.

19:58.230 --> 20:00.915
Now this portrait will grow old
for me

20:00.916 --> 20:02.249
and I'll stay nine forever.

20:02.250 --> 20:04.251
Oh! This "absence"
is delicious.

20:04.252 --> 20:05.719
It's absinthe, Lin.

20:05.720 --> 20:08.189
You're absinthe.

20:08.190 --> 20:10.191
Hey, Mom, are you
hallucinating yet?

20:10.192 --> 20:11.425
Not yet.
I need more.

20:11.426 --> 20:12.760
Okay, who wants what?

20:12.761 --> 20:14.395
I'll take a bullet
piece, please.

20:14.396 --> 20:16.330
Me, too!
I'll have a thigh.

20:16.331 --> 20:18.432
There's plenty of shrapnel
for everyone... don't be shy.

20:18.433 --> 20:21.268
Good thing the bullet hit Lance,
or else we'd be eating Dad.

20:21.269 --> 20:23.070
He'd taste old
and bitter.

20:23.071 --> 20:24.839
I bet Dad would've made
a great dinner.

20:24.840 --> 20:26.040
Thanks, Tina.

20:26.041 --> 20:27.274
Yeah, you're so plump.

20:27.275 --> 20:28.576
Oh.

20:28.577 --> 20:30.044
Aw, to delicious Bobby!

20:30.045 --> 20:32.246
Lin, don't toast to eating me.

20:32.247 --> 20:34.682
Eat Dad! Eat Dad! Eat Dad!

20:34.683 --> 20:36.567
Eat Bob! Eat Bob!
Stop it.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.135
Thanksgiving's over!
