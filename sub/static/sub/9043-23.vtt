WEBVTT

00:03.833 --> 00:06.867
- HEY, UH, HERE, LET ME HELP YOU
WITH THESE THINGS.

00:06.867 --> 00:08.033
THIS IS NICE,

00:08.033 --> 00:11.433
US WORKING TOGETHER
LIKE THIS.

00:11.433 --> 00:13.633
- WHAT'S GOING ON, RAY?

00:13.633 --> 00:15.667
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

00:15.667 --> 00:17.833
HERE'S THE THING.

00:17.833 --> 00:19.067
ROBERT AND THE GUYS,

00:19.067 --> 00:21.233
THEY, UH, WANT
TO GO GOLFING TOMORROW.

00:21.233 --> 00:24.867
AND I SAID,
"NO, NO WAY!"

00:24.867 --> 00:26.967
BECAUSE IT'S--
IT'S THE WEEKEND,

00:26.967 --> 00:28.733
AND THE WEEKEND IS
FOR FAMILY.

00:28.733 --> 00:29.867
- UGH.
- BUT THEN--

00:29.867 --> 00:31.533
- RAY, RAY, RAY.
SPARE ME.

00:31.533 --> 00:33.867
IF YOU WANT
TO PLAY GOLF, GO AHEAD.

00:33.867 --> 00:37.900
- REALLY? 'CAUSE I HAD
A LOT MORE PREPARED.

00:37.900 --> 00:39.233
- RAY, JUST PLAY GOLF.

00:39.233 --> 00:40.900
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO PUT ON A BIG SHOW.

00:40.900 --> 00:45.667
I MEAN, IT INSULTS ME WHEN YOU
PRETEND TO BE A GOOD HUSBAND.

00:45.667 --> 00:47.033
- HEY.

00:47.033 --> 00:48.267
- HEY.
- HEY.

00:48.267 --> 00:50.000
- SO, UH, RAYMOND,

00:50.000 --> 00:51.433
DID YOU TALK
TO A CERTAIN SOMEONE

00:51.433 --> 00:53.067
ABOUT A CERTAIN SOMETHING?

00:53.067 --> 00:54.733
- [sighs]

00:54.733 --> 00:57.000
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SPEAK IN CODE, MR. BOND.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.467
I ALREADY SAID YES.

00:58.467 --> 01:00.100
- YEAH.

01:00.100 --> 01:02.267
- SO, DEB, SINCE THE GUYS
ARE LEAVING FOR GOLF TONIGHT,

01:02.267 --> 01:03.900
MAYBE YOU AND I
SHOULD DO SOMETHING.

01:03.900 --> 01:06.267
- WHAT? TONIGHT?

01:08.533 --> 01:12.000
- OKAY. SEE...

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
WE'RE GOING TO PLAY
BETHPAGE BLACK,

01:15.000 --> 01:18.767
WHICH IS THE MOST FAMOUS
PUBLIC COURSE IN THE COUNTRY--

01:18.767 --> 01:21.433
PERHAPS THE WORLD--

01:21.433 --> 01:23.633
AND THE ONLY WAY
TO GET A TEE TIME

01:23.633 --> 01:25.600
IS TO LINE UP
IN YOUR CAR TONIGHT

01:25.600 --> 01:28.700
AND WAIT THERE
UNTIL THE MORNING.

01:28.700 --> 01:31.267
AND, UH...
WELL--

01:31.267 --> 01:33.033
- DEB,
PLEASE LET HIM DO THIS.

01:33.033 --> 01:35.400
I-I-IT'S FOR ME,
GIANNI, AND ANDY

01:35.400 --> 01:37.200
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
WE DON'T LIKE RAY EITHER.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.833
IT'S JUST, I MEAN...
WE NEED A FOURTH BODY.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.767
- YEAH.

01:41.767 --> 01:44.567
- AND A VAN.

01:44.567 --> 01:46.600
- GO AHEAD.

01:46.600 --> 01:47.900
- REALLY?

01:47.900 --> 01:50.767
- YEAH, GO.
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

01:50.767 --> 01:54.767
- THANK YOU!

01:54.767 --> 01:56.233
- HI.
- OH, HI, MARIE.

01:56.233 --> 01:59.000
- OH, I'M GLAD
YOU BOYS ARE HERE.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.600
MY LAUNDRY ROOM SHELVES
WERE DELIVERED,

02:00.600 --> 02:03.333
SO YOU CAN PUT THEM UP
TOMORROW MORNING.

02:03.333 --> 02:04.533
- OH, YEAH, YOU KNOW,
SORRY, MA,

02:04.533 --> 02:05.967
BUT RAY AND I
ARE GOING GOLFING.

02:05.967 --> 02:07.200
BUT WE'LL DO IT FOR YOU
ON SUNDAY.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.833
- NO, NO, NO.
THAT WON'T DO

02:08.833 --> 02:11.733
BECAUSE LEE AND STAN ARE COMING
FOR LUNCH TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

02:11.733 --> 02:15.533
- I-I-IT'S KIND OF
ALL SET, MA.

02:15.533 --> 02:19.733
- SO THE LIST OF THINGS
MORE IMPORTANT THAN ME

02:19.733 --> 02:23.867
JUST KEEPS GETTING LONGER.

02:23.867 --> 02:25.833
[groaning]

02:25.833 --> 02:27.733
ALL RIGHT, HOW ABOUT
DOING THE SHELVES NOW?

02:27.733 --> 02:30.933
DO YOU HAVE ANY TIME
FOR YOUR MOTHER NOW?

02:30.933 --> 02:32.467
- WELL, SEE, ACTUALLY,

02:32.467 --> 02:34.733
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO LEAVE
FOR THE GOLF COURSE TONIGHT.

02:34.733 --> 02:38.067
- OH. I UNDERSTAND.

02:38.067 --> 02:39.867
OKAY, GO GOLFING.

02:54.333 --> 02:56.100
- COME ON, JUST GET IT IN THERE.
COME ON, LET'S GO.

02:56.733 --> 03:00.500
- [gasps]
OH, OH.

03:00.500 --> 03:02.767
YOU BOYS HAVE DONE
A BEAUTIFUL JOB

03:02.767 --> 03:03.933
PUTTING THESE TOGETHER.

03:03.933 --> 03:05.200
- THANK YOU, MA.
THANKS.

03:05.200 --> 03:09.200
- DO ME A FAVOR.
DON'T SAND THEM IN HERE.

03:09.200 --> 03:10.533
- SAND THEM?

03:10.533 --> 03:11.733
- OF COURSE.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.900
YOU CAN'T PAINT THEM
UNTIL YOU SAND THEM.

03:13.900 --> 03:16.567
- PAINT THEM?

03:16.567 --> 03:19.067
- I CAN'T HAVE
UNFINISHED WOOD IN MY HOUSE.

03:19.067 --> 03:22.333
IT DOESN'T GO
WITH THE DECOR.

03:22.333 --> 03:25.067
- IT'S THE LAUNDRY ROOM!

03:25.067 --> 03:29.633
THIS COLOR WILL GO VERY NICE
WITH THAT ORANGE BOX OF TIDE.

03:29.633 --> 03:31.300
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
LOOK, MA,

03:31.300 --> 03:32.733
I'M JUST GOING TO PUT IT
BACK HERE FOR NOW,

03:32.733 --> 03:34.300
AND WE'LL PAINT IT
ON SUNDAY.

03:34.300 --> 03:36.700
- NO, I HAVE PEOPLE
COMING TOMORROW.

03:36.700 --> 03:40.733
OH, YOU MIGHT AS WELL
JUST DRAG IT OUT TO THE TRASH.

03:43.500 --> 03:45.433
- ALL RIGHT,
JUST CALL THE GUYS,

03:45.433 --> 03:47.400
AND TELL THEM
WE'LL MEET THEM AT THE COURSE.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.667
- REALLY? I MEAN,
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE!

03:49.667 --> 03:52.233
- OF COURSE IT IS!

03:52.233 --> 03:54.333
- I'LL BE HONEST, MARIE.
LOOKING AT THOSE SHELVES,

03:54.333 --> 03:56.100
I THINK LEE'S
GOING TO WIN THIS ONE.

03:56.100 --> 03:58.200
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WIN WHAT?

03:58.200 --> 03:59.600
- OH, LEE'S
ALL FULL OF HERSELF

03:59.600 --> 04:01.467
'CAUSE HER SON
BUILT A SPECIAL BOX

04:01.467 --> 04:05.167
FOR HER SPOON COLLECTION.

04:05.167 --> 04:07.633
- THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH ANYTHING.

04:07.633 --> 04:09.100
- GIVE ME A BREAK.

04:09.100 --> 04:11.767
THAT'S WHY YOUR MOTHER WANTS TO
DRAG LEE INTO THE LAUNDRY ROOM.

04:11.767 --> 04:14.400
SO SHE CAN SHOW HER
WHAT YOU TWO DO FOR HER.

04:14.400 --> 04:17.367
- OW!

04:17.367 --> 04:19.433
- THAT'S WHY WE'RE
DOING THIS, MA?

04:19.433 --> 04:20.933
BECAUSE--'CAUSE LEE'S SON
HAS NOTHING BETTER

04:20.933 --> 04:25.200
TO DO ALL DAY
THAN TO KISS HIS MOM'S BEHIND?

04:25.200 --> 04:28.100
- HAVE YOU SEEN
LEE'S BEHIND?

04:28.100 --> 04:31.633
IT DOES TAKE ALL DAY.

04:31.633 --> 04:33.233
- AND YET
WE STILL FELT BAD,

04:33.233 --> 04:34.900
LIKE WHAT WE WERE DOING
WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

04:34.900 --> 04:38.033
- YEAH, WE ALWAYS FEEL BAD.
WE FALL FOR IT EVERY TIME!

04:38.033 --> 04:40.900
THE GUILT.
YOUR GUILT!

04:40.900 --> 04:44.200
- IF YOU FEEL GUILTY,
IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF ME.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.433
- OH, YEAH, RIGHT, MA.

04:45.433 --> 04:46.667
AND BY THE WAY,
WHERE'S THE LIMP?

04:46.667 --> 04:50.267
- YEAH!

04:53.267 --> 04:56.733
- I FEEL VERY SAD.

04:58.967 --> 05:02.500
ALL THIS ANGER
AGAINST ME

05:02.500 --> 05:05.033
BECAUSE
OF YOUR PRECIOUS GOLF.

05:05.033 --> 05:08.200
- NO, NO! THAT'S JUST THE STRAW
THAT BROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK!

05:08.200 --> 05:09.267
YOU'VE BEEN MAKING US
FEEL GUILTY

05:09.267 --> 05:10.933
ABOUT STUFF
OUR WHOLE LIVES,

05:10.933 --> 05:13.167
AND WE'RE SICK OF IT!
- SICK!

05:16.567 --> 05:19.467
- NOTHING IS EVER GOOD ENOUGH,
AND IT'S ALWAYS OUR FAULT!

05:19.467 --> 05:21.267
- HEY, YOU CAN'T SPEAK
TO YOUR MOTHER LIKE THAT!

05:21.267 --> 05:25.467
- YOU DO.
- SHE'S NOT MY MOTHER!

05:25.467 --> 05:28.267
- I'M SORRY. LOOK,
THE GUILT TRIP, IT'S OVER!

05:28.267 --> 05:29.500
COME ON.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

05:29.500 --> 05:30.967
AND WE'RE NOT MOVING THAT!

05:30.967 --> 05:32.133
- THAT'S RIGHT.
AMEN, BROTHER!

05:32.133 --> 05:33.400
- FINE! GO!

05:33.400 --> 05:35.467
LEAVE AN OLD,
CRIPPLED WOMAN

05:35.467 --> 05:39.533
WITH UNFINISHED SHELVES
AND AN UNCARING HUSBAND!

06:05.033 --> 06:06.300
- OKAY, YOU GUYS
ARE NUMBER 16 IN LINE.

06:07.267 --> 06:08.867
I'LL BE BACK HERE
AT 5:00 A.M.

06:08.867 --> 06:10.333
- OKAY.

06:10.333 --> 06:14.500
BOY, 6 1/2 HOURS
SITTING IN A CAR.

06:14.500 --> 06:18.733
THIS IS GREAT.

06:18.733 --> 06:20.700
- YEAH, WE WENT
THROUGH HELL TO GET HERE,

06:20.700 --> 06:21.867
BUT LOOK AT US NOW.

06:21.867 --> 06:24.533
- BETHPAGE BLACK, BABY.
- DOUGHNUTS AND STUFF.

06:24.533 --> 06:25.967
- HEY,
YOU GUYS WANT TO HEAR

06:25.967 --> 06:27.100
ABOUT THIS DREAM
I HAD LAST NIGHT?

06:27.100 --> 06:28.900
- WAS IT A SEX DREAM?
- NO.

06:28.900 --> 06:30.600
- THEN KEEP IT
TO YOURSELF.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.133
- HEY, HEY, I HAD A SEX DREAM.
- OH, YEAH?

06:33.133 --> 06:36.000
- AND YOU WERE THERE,
AND YOU WERE THERE--

06:36.000 --> 06:37.233
- OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

06:37.233 --> 06:39.067
- HE'S A WACKO!

06:39.067 --> 06:40.667
- HEY, I SAW A GUY
OUTSIDE THE GATE

06:40.667 --> 06:42.367
SELLING SAUSAGE AND PEPPER.
ANYBODY IN?

06:42.367 --> 06:43.867
- YEAH, GET ME ONE.
- YEAH, YEAH, ME TOO.

06:43.867 --> 06:45.467
- I'LL GO WITH YOU.
I WANT TO STRETCH MY LEGS.

06:45.467 --> 06:47.467
- WHAT, SO YOUR FEET
CAN TOUCH THE FLOOR?

06:47.467 --> 06:50.600
[laughter]

06:50.600 --> 06:51.667
- VERY FUNNY.

06:51.667 --> 06:53.133
YOU'RE OUT OF MY DREAM.

06:53.133 --> 06:54.733
[laughter]

06:54.733 --> 06:56.767
[door shuts]

06:56.767 --> 07:00.367
- OH.

07:05.833 --> 07:07.433
FEELING BAD
ABOUT MA?

07:07.433 --> 07:11.733
- YEAH.

07:11.733 --> 07:13.800
- YEAH, BUT WE WERE RIGHT
TO LEAVE, RIGHT?

07:13.800 --> 07:15.267
- OH, YEAH, DEFINITELY.

07:15.267 --> 07:17.000
AND I'M GLAD YOU WERE
THERE WITH ME, CUBBY.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.333
- YEAH.
NO, NO, WE WERE GOOD.

07:18.333 --> 07:20.333
WE STOOD UP
FOR EACH OTHER, YOU KNOW?

07:20.333 --> 07:21.767
WE GOT TO REMEMBER THAT
FOR THE FUTURE.

07:21.767 --> 07:23.400
- YEAH, IT'S TRUE,
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,

07:23.400 --> 07:25.633
WE USUALLY LET IT
DIVIDE AND CONQUER US,

07:25.633 --> 07:27.167
BUT TONIGHT,
IT WAS YOU AND ME.

07:27.167 --> 07:28.633
WE HAD THE POWER.
WE BEAT HER.

07:28.633 --> 07:31.333
- YEAH. YEAH.
AND SHE'S TOUGH TO BEAT.

07:31.333 --> 07:32.933
- YEAH, THE GUILT.
- YEAH.

07:32.933 --> 07:35.400
SHE MAJORED IN GUILT.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.000
WITH A MINOR
IN CRAZY.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.467
[laughs]

07:40.467 --> 07:42.600
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I GOT A BUDDY ON THE FORCE,

07:42.600 --> 07:45.233
AND HIS PARENTS
JUST MOVED TO CALIFORNIA.

07:45.233 --> 07:47.600
SEES THEM
TWICE A YEAR, TOPS.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.900
- OH!

07:50.900 --> 07:54.400
OH, HOW GREAT
WOULD THAT BE?

07:54.400 --> 07:57.633
YOU KNOW,
IT WOULD BE LIKE US...

07:57.633 --> 08:01.133
AMERICA...

08:01.133 --> 08:04.500
- THEM.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.733
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHERE
OLD PEOPLE LIKE TO GO?

08:06.733 --> 08:09.767
FLORIDA.
- OH, YEAH!

08:09.767 --> 08:11.567
- YES. HOW DO WE GET 'EM
TO GO THERE?

08:11.567 --> 08:12.967
- WELL,
NEXT TIME IT SNOWS,

08:12.967 --> 08:14.333
WE SHOW MA
PICTURES OF FLORIDA

08:14.333 --> 08:16.600
RIGHT AFTER DAD
HAD HER SHOVEL THE DRIVEWAY.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.267
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

08:18.267 --> 08:19.867
AND FOR DAD,
WE JUST TELL HIM

08:19.867 --> 08:24.067

08:25.933 --> 08:28.533
OH...HOW GREAT
WOULD THAT BE?

08:28.533 --> 08:30.300
MOM AND DAD
A WHOLE PLANE RIDE AWAY.

08:30.300 --> 08:32.767
- AHH...IT'S FUN
TO THINK ABOUT.

08:32.767 --> 08:35.000
- YEAH.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.433
NAH, WHO ARE WE KIDDING?

08:36.433 --> 08:37.933
THEY'RE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE, ARE THEY?

08:37.933 --> 08:40.133
- NO. THEY'RE GOING
TO BE WITH US FOREVER.

08:40.133 --> 08:41.900
- YEP.

08:41.900 --> 08:45.867
WELL, UNTIL THEY,
YOU KNOW...

08:45.867 --> 08:47.100
- YEAH.

08:47.100 --> 08:48.733
- YEAH, OF COURSE, DAD--

08:48.733 --> 08:52.133
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
THAT HE'S NOT GOING TO BE...

08:52.133 --> 08:54.233
- [chuckles]
YEAH.

08:54.233 --> 08:57.233
YEAH. THAT'S TRUE.
- YEAH.

08:57.233 --> 09:01.033
- HE MAY BE HEADED SOUTH
AFTER ALL.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.700
- UH, BOY, YOU KNOW,
BUT IT'S WEIRD,

09:04.700 --> 09:06.933
JUST TO PICTURE MA, YOU KNOW,
PADDING AROUND THE HOUSE

09:06.933 --> 09:08.933
WITH NO ONE TO YELL AT.

09:08.933 --> 09:10.333
- WELL, YOU DON'T KNOW

09:10.333 --> 09:11.567
THAT DAD'S DEFINITELY
GOING TO GO FIRST.

09:11.567 --> 09:13.267
- OH, COME ON,
DID YOU SEE THE WAY

09:13.267 --> 09:14.833
HE WAS WOLFING DOWN
THAT MEATBALL SUB TONIGHT?

09:14.833 --> 09:16.400
I MEAN, I DON'T EXACTLY--

09:16.400 --> 09:20.200
I DON'T EXACTLY SEE HIM
BLOWING OUT A HUNDRED CANDLES.

09:23.833 --> 09:25.733
- YEAH.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.500
I GUESS AT SOME POINT
DOWN THE ROAD,

09:27.500 --> 09:28.667
WE'LL HAVE
TO PUT MOM

09:28.667 --> 09:30.400
IN A HOME
OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW?

09:30.400 --> 09:33.033
- YEAH. YEAH, I-I GUESS
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO, RIGHT?

09:33.033 --> 09:34.300
- YEAH.
- BUT--BUT A NICE ONE.

09:34.300 --> 09:35.800
- OH, YEAH, YEAH, NO.
A GOOD ONE.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.567
- YEAH, NOT THE KIND
THEY INVESTIGATE ON THE NEWS.

09:37.567 --> 09:39.467
- NO.

09:39.467 --> 09:41.467
UH-UH, IT'S GOT TO BE
FIRST-CLASS, YOU KNOW?

09:41.467 --> 09:43.633
IT'S GOT TO HAVE FLOWERS
AND...

09:43.633 --> 09:48.367
AND A TELEVISION. YEAH.

09:48.367 --> 09:50.467
- YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
SHE STILL WON'T LIKE IT.

09:50.467 --> 09:52.333
EVEN IF IT'S
A NICE OLD AGE HOME,

09:52.333 --> 09:54.767
MA, SHE'LL STILL FIND SOMETHING
TO COMPLAIN ABOUT.

09:54.767 --> 09:56.167
- YEAH, TRUE.

09:56.167 --> 09:58.967
SHE'LL PROBABLY TRY
TO ESCAPE A LOT...

09:58.967 --> 10:01.733
WHICH I THINK
THEY CHARGE YOU FOR.

10:06.567 --> 10:08.567
WELL, YOU KNOW,
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

10:08.567 --> 10:12.000
YOU AND AMY'LL PROBABLY
TAKE CARE OF HER.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.300
- WAIT A MINUTE.

10:18.300 --> 10:21.667
WHY ARE YOU TRYING
TO PAWN HER OFF ON ME?

10:21.667 --> 10:23.400
- NO, NO.
IT'S JUST THAT...

10:23.400 --> 10:24.700
YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE

10:24.700 --> 10:26.367
INTO THAT HOUSE
EVENTUALLY ANYWAY, RIGHT?

10:26.367 --> 10:27.733
- WHY DO YOU
ASSUME THAT?

10:27.733 --> 10:30.700
- I JUST ASSUMED THAT WHEN--
WHEN THEY GO,

10:30.700 --> 10:32.967
YOU'LL GET THE HOUSE,
AND THEN YOU'LL...

10:32.967 --> 10:34.367
YOU'LL FINALLY HAVE A HOUSE.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.800
- OH, SO NOW
I'M JUST A LOSER

10:36.800 --> 10:40.067
WHO CAN'T BUY MY OWN HOUSE
OR MAKE HIS WAY IN THE WORLD,

10:40.067 --> 10:41.733
SO I'LL JUST MOVE
BACK WITH MOMMY.

10:41.733 --> 10:45.400
- LOOK, I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK
OF WHAT IS BEST FOR MA.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.633
- OH, WELL,
AREN'T YOU A SAINT?

10:47.633 --> 10:48.733
- WHAT?

10:48.733 --> 10:50.500
- OF COURSE,
I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK

10:50.500 --> 10:52.800
WHAT WOULD BE BEST FOR MA
IS FOR HER TO LIVE OUT HER DAYS

10:52.800 --> 10:57.200
IN THE PLACE WHERE SHE
ALREADY SPENDS MOST OF HER TIME.

10:57.200 --> 11:00.367
- UH, NO! NO.
- WHY? WHY?

11:00.367 --> 11:01.767
COME ON, RAYMOND.
IT'S PERFECT.

11:01.767 --> 11:04.200
I MEAN, ONE DAY SHE'S OVER
AT YOUR HOUSE,

11:04.200 --> 11:07.000
AND THEN
SHE JUST DOESN'T LEAVE.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.533
- UH-UH.

11:08.533 --> 11:10.467
- YEAH, I CAN DROP OFF
HER TOOTHBRUSH

11:10.467 --> 11:14.633
AND A GALLON OF JEAN NATE,
AND SHE'D BE ALL SET.

11:14.633 --> 11:17.633
- NO, LISTEN, WAIT A MINUTE.
- NO, SHE'S YOURS, RAYMOND.

11:17.633 --> 11:19.600
- NO, SHE'S NOT!
- ALL YOURS!

11:19.600 --> 11:21.067
- SHE CAN'T STAY IN MY HOUSE,
OKAY?

11:21.067 --> 11:22.200
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROOM!

11:22.200 --> 11:23.533
- OH, COME ON,

11:23.533 --> 11:24.733
YOU'VE GOT PLENTY
OF ROOM DOWNSTAIRS

11:24.733 --> 11:26.100
IN YOUR OFFICE THERE.

11:26.100 --> 11:27.433
YOU JUST PUT IN A NICE RUG

11:27.433 --> 11:29.400
AND PUT UP A BIG PICTURE
OF YOU AND HER TOGETHER.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.567
OH, SHE'LL BE VERY HAPPY.

11:31.567 --> 11:33.900
- OKAY,
SO SINCE YOU'RE TOO STUBBORN

11:33.900 --> 11:35.067
TO MOVE INTO THAT HOUSE,

11:35.067 --> 11:37.267
LIKE WE ALL KNOW
IS YOUR DESTINY,

11:37.267 --> 11:38.900
YOU'RE GOING TO FORCE
YOUR OWN MOTHER

11:38.900 --> 11:40.300
TO LIVE IN A BASEMENT,
HUH?

11:40.300 --> 11:42.333
A DARK,
DISGUSTING BASEMENT

11:42.333 --> 11:46.567
WITH THE RATS
AND THE COCKROACHES.

11:46.567 --> 11:49.167
- RAYMOND,
RAYMOND, RAYMOND.

11:49.167 --> 11:50.733
DON'T FIGHT IT.

11:50.733 --> 11:52.567
WHO DO YOU THINK
SHE'D RATHER BE WITH?

11:52.567 --> 11:54.767
WE ALL KNOW
THAT YOU'RE THE FAVORITE.

11:54.767 --> 11:56.700
AND THAT, MY FRIEND...

11:56.700 --> 12:00.000
IS YOUR DESTINY.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.800
- YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR MIND!

12:02.800 --> 12:04.767
SHE LOVES US BOTH EQUALLY.

12:04.767 --> 12:07.267
- [laughs hysterically]

12:07.267 --> 12:10.700
- YEAH.
- YEAH, RIGHT! OKAY!

12:10.700 --> 12:12.000
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.567
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
WHY DON'T WE DO THIS?

12:14.567 --> 12:17.367
WE'LL PUT HER IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE ROOM, CALL HER NAME,

12:17.367 --> 12:21.167
AND SEE WHO SHE COMES TO.

12:27.933 --> 12:30.733
- WAIT A MINUTE, ROBERT.

12:30.733 --> 12:32.233
I-I DON'T THINK

12:32.233 --> 12:34.667
YOU'RE TAKING EVERY FACTOR
INTO CONSIDERATION.

12:34.667 --> 12:35.700
YOU'RE FORGETTING

12:35.700 --> 12:39.367
A VERY SPECIAL
LITTLE LADY NAMED DEBRA.

12:39.367 --> 12:41.667
YOU THINK MA WANTS
TO SPEND THE REST OF HER LIFE

12:41.667 --> 12:45.500
UNDER THE SAME ROOF
WITH HER ARCH-NEMESIS?

12:47.900 --> 12:49.333
NOT LIKELY.

12:49.333 --> 12:53.833
BUT WHOSE WIFE
DOES SHE LOVE?

12:53.833 --> 12:56.633
WHOSE WIFE DOES SHE JUST THINK
IS THE CAT'S BANANAS?

12:56.633 --> 12:58.333
- HEY, LOOK,
DON'T BRING OUR WIVES--

12:58.333 --> 13:03.167
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT!
IT'S AMY!

13:03.167 --> 13:04.600
PRECIOUS LITTLE AMY.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.000
SO YOU CAN PUT MA
IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT ROOM.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.433
AS SOON AS SHE GETS
ONE LOOK AT AMY,

13:07.433 --> 13:09.033
SHE'S GOING TO COME
SCAMPERING OVER TO YOU,

13:09.033 --> 13:11.667
TONGUE OUT
AND TAIL A-WAGGING!

13:11.667 --> 13:15.000
[pants]

13:15.000 --> 13:17.467
- DAMN IT!

13:20.267 --> 13:26.400
- [chuckling]

13:46.567 --> 13:51.367
- HOW ABOUT
WE GOLF FOR IT?

13:51.367 --> 13:52.167
- WHAT?

13:52.167 --> 13:54.600
- TODAY.
18 HOLES.

13:54.600 --> 13:58.200
LOSER GETS MA.

14:04.833 --> 14:06.633
- WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING?

14:06.633 --> 14:07.633
- WHAT, ARE YOU CHICKEN?

14:07.633 --> 14:09.667
- NO, NO, I AM NOT.

14:09.667 --> 14:12.000
I WAS GOING TO DESTROY YOU
ANYWAY, SO FINE.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.467
THIS'LL BE THE ICING
ON MY DELICIOUS VICTORY PIE.

14:15.467 --> 14:19.367
- YEAH? WE'LL SEE WHO'LL
BE EATING THE DELICIOUS PIE.

14:19.367 --> 14:21.367
- OH, YOU ARE GOING DOWN!

14:21.367 --> 14:24.600
- OH, YEAH? YOU'RE GOING DOWN
TO YOUR BASEMENT,

14:24.600 --> 14:27.267
SO YOU CAN PRETTY IT ALL UP
FOR BIG MAMA.

14:27.267 --> 14:30.067
- NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

14:30.067 --> 14:32.600
I DON'T THINK SO. NO.
- I DO, I DO.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.033
- I BEAT YOU PRETTY GOOD
THE LAST TIME, PAL.

14:34.033 --> 14:35.233
- YEAH, RIGHT,
AND I BEAT YOU

14:35.233 --> 14:36.433
THE LAST THREE TIMES
BEFORE THAT.

14:36.433 --> 14:37.667
- YEAH, WELL,
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

14:37.667 --> 14:39.433
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING
MY PUTTING

14:39.433 --> 14:41.267
WHILE DEBRA THINKS
I'M READING TO THE KIDS, OKAY?

14:41.267 --> 14:44.467
SO--SO JUST GET READY,
MAN.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.567
[imitating Marie] "OH, ROBBIE,
IT'S TOO COLD IN THE HOUSE.

14:46.567 --> 14:48.367
"ROBBIE, IT'S TOO HOT
IN THE HOUSE.

14:48.367 --> 14:53.100
ROBBIE, I HOPE YOU'RE MAKING
A BABY IN THERE."

14:53.100 --> 14:54.567
YEAH! YEAH!

14:54.567 --> 14:56.967
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT IS CORRECT.

14:56.967 --> 15:01.167
SHE IS GOING TO BE WITH YOU
TILL THE DAY SHE DIES.

15:08.967 --> 15:10.567
- OKAY, HOW ABOUT THIS?

15:10.567 --> 15:14.567
- FORGET ABOUT IT.
FORGET ABOUT IT.

15:14.567 --> 15:15.900
- WHAT?

15:15.900 --> 15:18.100
- JUST--I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

15:18.100 --> 15:20.967
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

15:20.967 --> 15:24.467
- NOTHING. IT'S JUST...

15:24.467 --> 15:29.100
YOU KNOW, ONE DAY
SHE'S REALLY GOING TO...

15:29.100 --> 15:32.533
YOU KNOW.

15:32.533 --> 15:33.800
- WELL, YEAH.

15:33.800 --> 15:37.400
I MEAN...

15:39.467 --> 15:43.067
YEAH.

15:46.267 --> 15:48.600
- I'LL TAKE HER.

15:48.600 --> 15:49.667
- WHAT?

15:49.667 --> 15:52.867
- I'LL TAKE HER.
I WANT TO TAKE MOM.

15:52.867 --> 15:54.900
- W-WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE HER? I--

15:54.900 --> 15:57.133
- WHAT? YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT IT.

15:57.133 --> 15:58.600
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

15:58.600 --> 16:00.067
I MEAN, YOU JUST CHANGED
YOUR MIND

16:00.067 --> 16:01.367
JUST LIKE THAT?

16:01.367 --> 16:03.100
- YOU JUST SAID
THAT YOU DON'T WANT HER.

16:03.100 --> 16:06.267
- WELL, MAYBE
I CHANGED MY MIND.

16:06.267 --> 16:09.167
MAYBE--MAYBE--
MAYBE I WANT HER BACK NOW.

16:09.167 --> 16:10.633
- IT'S TOO LATE.
I CALLED IT!

16:10.633 --> 16:12.400
- NO, NO, YOU CAN'T CALL IT,
RAYMOND.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.567
[stammers] I WANT HER.
I REALLY DO.

16:14.567 --> 16:15.800
AND ALL THOSE THINGS
I SAID BEFORE

16:15.800 --> 16:17.333
WERE JUST TO ANNOY YOU.

16:17.333 --> 16:19.433
BESIDES, I'M GOING TO MOVE
BACK IN THAT HOUSE.

16:19.433 --> 16:20.733
- THAT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER!

16:20.733 --> 16:22.933
- SHE'S BETTER OFF WITH ME!
- NO!

16:22.933 --> 16:24.367
- I'M TALL AND STRONG,

16:24.367 --> 16:26.700
AND I CAN CARRY HER
UP TO HER BED ON MY BACK!

16:26.700 --> 16:29.400
- SO? I WOULD BE
A BETTER PROVIDER FOR HER

16:29.400 --> 16:30.600
THAN YOU WOULD.
- OH, WHY?

16:30.600 --> 16:32.167
BECAUSE YOU MAKE
MORE MONEY THAN ME, HUH?

16:32.167 --> 16:33.167
YOU'RE GOING TO THROW THAT
IN MY FACE?

16:33.167 --> 16:34.500
- NO, I'M JUST SAYING

16:34.500 --> 16:37.933
THAT WHEN IT COMES
TO MONEY, I HAVE MORE.

16:37.933 --> 16:39.233
- OKAY.

16:39.233 --> 16:40.833
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:40.833 --> 16:44.533
WE'RE GOING TO GOLF FOR IT,
BUT THE OTHER WAY.

16:44.533 --> 16:46.033
WINNER GETS MA.

16:46.033 --> 16:49.233
- OH, FINE, FINE! BRING IT ON!
- OH, I'M GOING TO BRING IT!

16:49.233 --> 16:50.600
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
KEEP YOUR RECEIPT

16:50.600 --> 16:52.000
'CAUSE YOU'RE GOING
TO RETURN IT!

16:52.000 --> 16:54.067
- YOU KEEP THE RECEIPT!
- YEAH, I WILL!

16:54.067 --> 16:55.400
WE DON'T EVEN
HAVE TO DO THIS!

16:55.400 --> 16:56.667
BECAUSE IT'S
LIKE YOU SAID BEFORE,

16:56.667 --> 16:59.533
MA LOVES ME MORE!

17:05.900 --> 17:08.167
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:08.167 --> 17:10.733
SHE CAN LOVE YOU
ALL SHE WANTS

17:10.733 --> 17:14.767
BECAUSE I LOVE HER...

17:14.767 --> 17:18.133
MORE THAN YOU DO.

17:18.133 --> 17:21.933
- WHAT?
- YOU HEARD ME.

17:21.933 --> 17:24.567
I LOVE MOM MORE.

17:24.567 --> 17:29.333
- ARE YOU INSANE?

17:29.333 --> 17:30.867
- DEEP DOWN INSIDE,
RAYMOND,

17:30.867 --> 17:33.267
YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE.

17:33.267 --> 17:36.833
- ARE YOU SAYING
THAT I DON'T LOVE MY MOTHER?

17:36.833 --> 17:40.333
- NOT AS MUCH AS ME.

17:40.333 --> 17:41.733
YOU TAKE HER FOR GRANTED.

17:41.733 --> 17:43.233
BUT ME?

17:43.233 --> 17:47.233
I CHERISH EVERY OUNCE
OF AFFECTION THAT WOMAN GIVES ME

17:47.233 --> 17:49.367
BECAUSE I HAVE
TO FIGHT FOR IT

17:49.367 --> 17:53.167
LIKE A DIRTY DOG
IN THE STREET.

17:55.767 --> 17:56.933
BUT YOU?

17:56.933 --> 17:59.267
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE
TO TRY.

17:59.267 --> 18:03.433
SHE MAKES IT
SO EASY FOR YOU.

18:03.433 --> 18:06.833
YOU'RE JUST A FAT KID
SITTING WITH HIS MOUTH OPEN

18:06.833 --> 18:10.633
AT THE END
OF A CHOCOLATE ASSEMBLY LINE.

18:23.700 --> 18:27.300
YOU DISGUST ME.

18:31.233 --> 18:34.133
I'M GETTING MA.

18:34.133 --> 18:35.567
- YOU'RE NOT GETTING MA.

18:35.567 --> 18:37.567
- DON'T PUSH ME!

18:37.567 --> 18:38.600
OW!

18:38.600 --> 18:42.433
- GET AWAY! GET AWAY!
GET OUT!

18:50.000 --> 18:52.167
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING, HUH?
- AAH!

18:52.167 --> 18:54.567
GET OFF ME!
- COME HERE!

18:54.567 --> 18:57.067
- YOU LEAVE ME ALONE!
AHH!

18:57.067 --> 18:58.367
- COME HERE, YOU!
- YOU STARTED IT!

18:58.367 --> 19:01.433
- [shouts indistinctly]
- YOU STARTED IT!

19:01.433 --> 19:04.933
[overlapping
indistinct shouting]

19:04.933 --> 19:06.500
- GET OUT OF HERE!
- COME HERE!

19:06.500 --> 19:07.767
- WHOA!

19:07.767 --> 19:08.867
- COME HERE.
COME HERE.

19:08.867 --> 19:10.367
- ROBERT, STOP!
- HERE!

19:10.367 --> 19:11.900
- EAT IT! EAT IT!
- NO! STOP!

19:11.900 --> 19:15.033
STOP!
TRUCE! TRUCE!

19:15.033 --> 19:17.933
- ALL RIGHT!
- TRUCE!

19:17.933 --> 19:19.200
TRUCE! TRUCE!

19:19.200 --> 19:20.667
- ALL RIGHT, TRUCE.

19:20.667 --> 19:22.033
- TRUCE! TRUCE!
- TRUCE.

19:22.033 --> 19:24.867
- TRUCE, TRUCE.
NO TRUCE! NO TRUCE!

19:24.867 --> 19:26.000
NO TRUCE!

19:26.000 --> 19:29.600
- AAH! AAH!

19:32.900 --> 19:34.600
- ENOUGH NOW!
- ENOUGH!

19:34.600 --> 19:35.733
- OKAY.
- TRUCE!

19:35.733 --> 19:36.967
- TRUCE.
- TRUCE!

19:36.967 --> 19:39.067
- FOR REAL,
FOR REAL TRUCE!

19:39.067 --> 19:41.800
ENOUGH, ENOUGH.

19:41.800 --> 19:45.433
TRUCE.

19:49.800 --> 19:53.633
- WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
GOT TO DO THE NIPPLE?

19:55.100 --> 19:58.733
- MY NOSTRIL
IS JELLIED SHUT.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.567
TRUCE.

20:02.567 --> 20:04.900
- TRUCE.
TRUCE.

20:04.900 --> 20:08.500
- TRUCE.

20:11.333 --> 20:13.000
[door slides open]

20:13.000 --> 20:14.633
- MAN, THESE SAUSAGES
SMELL GOOD.

20:14.633 --> 20:17.700
- YOU GUYS OWE ME
THREE BUCKS EACH.

20:17.700 --> 20:21.567
OKAY, HERE'S YOUR--

20:34.133 --> 20:35.433
- OH, HEY! HERE THEY ARE!
- HEY.

20:35.900 --> 20:37.433
- WHAT HAPPENED?

20:37.433 --> 20:41.500
- UH, HE--HE HIT A COUPLE
OF REALLY BAD SHOTS, YEAH.

20:41.500 --> 20:44.467
- IT'S 8:00.
HOW LONG WAS GOLF?

20:44.467 --> 20:46.233
- WELL, WE DID SOMETHING
