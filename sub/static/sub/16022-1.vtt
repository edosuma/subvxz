00:00.001 --> 00:04.036
Russell:
<i>Previously on</i> csi:
<i>Our serial killer</i>

00:04.038 --> 00:05.504
<i>Got all of his inspiration</i>

00:05.506 --> 00:07.439
<i>From one place:</i>
<i>The nine circles of hell.</i>

00:07.441 --> 00:08.774
<i>Your daughter, ellie,</i>
<i>is one of the girls</i>

00:08.776 --> 00:10.075
Who may be missing.

00:10.077 --> 00:11.510
Larson:
<i>The pictures I sent online?</i>

00:11.512 --> 00:13.712
<i>A client who reached out</i>
<i>to my ministry.</i>

00:13.714 --> 00:16.048
Oliver tate.
Works for a biotech company.

00:16.050 --> 00:17.516
Brody:
<i>Without an undercover</i>
<i>operation,</i>

00:17.518 --> 00:19.118
<i>We are all just sitting around</i>

00:19.120 --> 00:21.053
<i>Waiting for</i>
<i>another body to drop.</i>

00:21.055 --> 00:22.221
I need to do this, dad.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.422
Russell:
<i>Stop the suv.</i>

00:23.424 --> 00:25.524
<i>Killer's got morgan.</i>
<i>And ellie.</i>

00:25.526 --> 00:26.725
He's got them both.

00:30.063 --> 00:31.730
Priest:
The book of job tells the story

00:31.732 --> 00:34.400
Of a man who loved god

00:34.402 --> 00:38.203
And renounced evil.

00:38.205 --> 00:42.274
Until one day,
satan posed a challenge to god.

00:43.643 --> 00:45.711
Test this man.

00:45.713 --> 00:48.113
Test his faith.

00:48.115 --> 00:51.417
When we mourn,

00:51.419 --> 00:54.086
We're all tempted to curse god.

00:54.088 --> 00:58.257
To give voice to our anger,
our confusion.

00:58.259 --> 01:01.460
Our sense of powerlessness
against evil.

01:01.462 --> 01:04.563
<i>We're tempted to ask:</i>

01:04.565 --> 01:09.201
<i>Are we being punished</i>
<i>for our own sins?</i>

01:09.203 --> 01:11.837
<i>We're tempted to ask:</i>

01:11.839 --> 01:15.074
<i>Is there something</i>
<i>we could have done?</i>

01:15.076 --> 01:18.410
Tate:
You are the angry girl.

01:22.849 --> 01:25.117
(siren whoops)

01:26.152 --> 01:28.487
Get out of the car!
Now!
Get out!

01:30.590 --> 01:33.659
Nick! She's not here.
Russell, morgan's gone.

01:33.661 --> 01:34.793
(sighs)

01:34.795 --> 01:38.263
Oliver tate, lvpd!

01:38.265 --> 01:39.398
Go, go!

01:39.400 --> 01:41.266
Go left!

01:41.268 --> 01:42.668
Yep. Clear.
Clear!

01:42.670 --> 01:43.769
Sheriff, it's clear.

01:43.771 --> 01:46.371
No sign of...
Find tate.

01:46.373 --> 01:47.873
Russell:
<i>Nick, traffic cams</i>
<i>showed two suvs.</i>

01:47.875 --> 01:49.608
<i>We're tracking</i>
<i>the other one now.</i>

01:51.277 --> 01:52.511
I got it.

01:52.513 --> 01:53.879
Russell:
The suv with morgan

01:53.881 --> 01:55.280
Is parked outside
a storage facility

01:55.282 --> 01:56.548
Off of hill

01:56.550 --> 01:58.617
<i>And decatur.</i>

02:19.472 --> 02:21.373
Greg.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.774
Greg!

02:22.776 --> 02:25.410
Drop back!

02:34.521 --> 02:36.588
Greg?

02:53.540 --> 02:56.208
Russell:
Nick, greg, talk to me.
What's going on?

03:03.683 --> 03:06.518
♪ who... Are you?

03:06.520 --> 03:09.755
♪ who, who, who, who?

03:35.949 --> 03:38.584
Stokes (on radio):
Stand by, russell.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.601
Sanders:
It's not morgan.
It sure looks like her, though.

03:55.603 --> 03:56.935
Her hair, her dress.

03:56.937 --> 03:59.404
Stokes:
I think it's one of
the missing girls

03:59.406 --> 04:00.405
From larson's church.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.274
The crime scene's

04:02.276 --> 04:05.777
Staged like the
fifth circle of hell.

04:05.779 --> 04:08.247
We'll start to process.
Uh, get us some help

04:08.249 --> 04:09.281
Out here, will you?

04:09.283 --> 04:10.315
If I may conjecture...

04:10.317 --> 04:11.316
Russell:
John, not now.

04:11.318 --> 04:12.517
Your press badge only gets you

04:12.519 --> 04:15.754
This has nothing to do
with my being a reporter

04:15.756 --> 04:17.556
Doing some story
right now.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.625
If neither ellie brass
nor csi brody

04:19.627 --> 04:20.892
Were intended to be

04:20.894 --> 04:23.495
The killer's next
victim, then...

04:23.497 --> 04:25.697
Then there is still
hope, isn't there?

04:25.699 --> 04:28.600
There are four circles
of hell left,

04:28.602 --> 04:31.470
So... More circles
means more time.

04:31.472 --> 04:32.771
We are gonna find them.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.573
Alive?

04:34.575 --> 04:35.941
Or like all the others?

04:35.943 --> 04:38.343
Ecklie:
We know you're working
with oliver tate.

04:38.345 --> 04:40.345
Oliver tate.
(chuckles)

04:40.347 --> 04:41.647
No way.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.015
Where are the girls?

04:43.017 --> 04:45.050
I already told your
guys who stopped me.

04:45.052 --> 04:47.486
Now I'm telling you--
I don't know.

04:47.488 --> 04:48.954
Ecklie:
And we're telling you
we don't buy it.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.456
Two suvs, two drivers--
you playing decoy,

04:51.458 --> 04:53.292
And whoever was
driving the girl.

04:53.294 --> 04:54.559
And not just any girl.

04:54.561 --> 04:55.994
I know your daughter ellie

04:55.996 --> 04:57.663
From brother larson's church.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.498
She told me all about you.

05:00.600 --> 05:01.833
(whispers):
I'm not your little girl.

05:03.503 --> 05:05.037
You're gonna talk to us.

05:05.039 --> 05:06.905
Kiss my ass.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.907
Brass: All right,
all right, no, no, no, no.

05:08.909 --> 05:11.043
Ecklie:
The kid knows
where morgan is, jim.

05:11.045 --> 05:15.047
You want to know why
I was driving that suv?

05:15.049 --> 05:17.616
I work for brother larson.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.518
Talk to him.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.520
You set us up,
you son of a bitch.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.555
I don't know what kind of...

05:23.557 --> 05:26.525
Intimidation
jake was subjected to,

05:26.527 --> 05:28.527
But I know the boy's
flesh is weak.

05:28.529 --> 05:31.630
Righteousness and a good lawyer,
cast out that confession

05:31.632 --> 05:34.833
Faster than jesus cast out the
moneychangers from the temple.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.535
I-I don't way what
game you're...

05:36.537 --> 05:37.703
You think you're
playing here.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.971
You-you and tate
are on the hook

05:39.973 --> 05:42.074
For four murders, and
now two kidnappings.

05:42.076 --> 05:44.076
I'm being set up, pal.

05:44.078 --> 05:46.578
I'm telling you,
oliver tate is setting me up.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.480
Why would tate go after you?

05:48.482 --> 05:50.816
Obviously, a man of tate's...

05:50.818 --> 05:53.485
Dark desires is vulnerable.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.987
I tried
to blackmail him, but...

05:55.989 --> 05:58.724
Man wouldn't pay
my price, so...

05:58.726 --> 06:00.726
I called his bluff.

06:00.728 --> 06:03.829
I shared his secrets
with his...

06:03.831 --> 06:05.831
Friends, his employer.

06:05.833 --> 06:06.965
(chuckles softly)

06:06.967 --> 06:09.901
Much to his chagrin,
I imagine.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.703
You don't believe me, do you?

06:11.705 --> 06:14.606
No.
Admittedly, I've
not earned your faith.

06:14.608 --> 06:18.143
But... I know someone who has.

06:18.145 --> 06:20.412
Someone who was once

06:20.414 --> 06:22.981
Tate's favorite forbidden fruit.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.117
Someone who once
saved your life.

06:25.119 --> 06:26.151
Angela?

06:26.153 --> 06:27.719
The very same.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.788
I should warn you, mr. Russell,

06:29.790 --> 06:32.724
If oliver tate is
the master of this game,

06:32.726 --> 06:35.994
He will never stop
until he sees to it...

06:35.996 --> 06:38.063
We all burn.

06:39.432 --> 06:40.832
Ellie:
Can you hear me?

06:40.834 --> 06:42.100
Are you okay?

06:42.102 --> 06:44.503
Can you hear me?

06:44.505 --> 06:47.572
Are you okay?

06:47.574 --> 06:49.775
Can you hear me?

06:51.177 --> 06:53.445
Ellie?

06:53.447 --> 06:55.647
You're the cop.
He said you'd be coming.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.653
Who? Who said that?

07:01.655 --> 07:04.156
I don't know.
I haven't seen his face.

07:04.158 --> 07:05.657
All I know
is that I was with him

07:05.659 --> 07:06.958
At his condo,
and then I woke up here.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.927
You were
with him, too?

07:08.929 --> 07:10.996
Yeah.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.899
Where are we?

07:13.901 --> 07:15.801
What is this place?

07:15.803 --> 07:18.136
It's hell.

07:26.979 --> 07:29.114
Robbins:
Hyoid bone's broken.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.715
Denise tyler was strangled.

07:32.685 --> 07:35.821
Thoracic injuries
appear postmortem

07:35.823 --> 07:38.156
From being impaled
on that spear.
Staged.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.825
Just like the others.

07:39.827 --> 07:42.060
We've seen this
latent bruising before.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.495
Our last victim.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.630
(beep)

07:45.632 --> 07:47.032
"barb...

07:47.034 --> 07:48.700
"the...

07:48.702 --> 07:50.001
Thorns."

07:50.003 --> 07:51.670
What does that mean?

07:51.672 --> 07:53.772
I don't know.

07:53.774 --> 07:54.873
This guy's dropping bodies,

07:54.875 --> 07:56.842
He's staging crime scenes

07:56.844 --> 08:00.145
And leaving nothing behind
to tie him to the murders.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.481
Robbins:
Maybe this time he did.
This looks like

08:02.483 --> 08:03.882
A dried secretion.

08:04.617 --> 08:07.085
<i>Perhaps a bead of sweat</i>

08:07.087 --> 08:09.154
<i>From the attack.</i>

08:09.156 --> 08:11.957
Phillips:
<i>Could be our killer's dna.</i>

08:15.228 --> 08:17.229
Who's the mannequin
supposed to be,

08:17.231 --> 08:18.230
The grim reaper or something?

08:18.232 --> 08:20.565
Phlegyas, the boatman.

08:20.567 --> 08:23.568
In dante's <i>inferno,</i>
<i>virgil escorts dante</i>

08:23.570 --> 08:25.637
Down through
the nine circles of hell,

08:25.639 --> 08:27.672
And phlegyas here
is the one who

08:27.674 --> 08:30.075
Gets him across the river styx,
the river of death.

08:31.110 --> 08:32.711
I always liked engineering.

08:32.713 --> 08:35.680
How wide
do you think that door is?

08:35.682 --> 08:37.115
I don't know,
maybe four feet.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.884
And the beam
of this boat?

08:38.886 --> 08:40.652
At least six.

08:40.654 --> 08:43.154
Somebody put this thing
together in here.

08:43.156 --> 08:45.690
Let's see if we can take
it apart real quick.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.059
I think there's a
seam right here.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.796
Ready?
Yeah.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.739
Balliol's bones--
just like the ones our guy's

09:00.741 --> 09:03.241
Been leaving behind for us
in the bibles.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.744
Stokes:
Yeah, but those dowels

09:05.746 --> 09:08.813
Had zeros on them;
these have zeros

09:08.815 --> 09:11.182
And numbers in repeating order

09:11.184 --> 09:12.617
From stem to stern.

09:12.619 --> 09:13.818
Maybe it's some kind

09:13.820 --> 09:15.954
Of, uh, sequence, like a code.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.693
Russell:
<i>Tate's leaving us messages.</i>

09:21.695 --> 09:23.762
He must've left us something
somewhere in that condo.

09:23.764 --> 09:26.131
I mean, he know we were
gonna tear the place apart.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.899
I'm telling you,
I haven't found anything,

09:27.901 --> 09:29.301
And I mean anything.

09:29.303 --> 09:30.902
There is no blood,

09:30.904 --> 09:32.671
There are no signs of violence.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.339
There is nothing here
to even suggest

09:34.341 --> 09:35.740
A secondary location.

09:35.742 --> 09:40.312
You know, there's got to be
a message there someplace.

09:40.314 --> 09:43.915
Did you find any trace
from the crime scene?

09:43.917 --> 09:45.650
Boat, suv, dowel?

09:45.652 --> 09:48.587
I did find trace on the spear
and the planks of the dory.

09:48.589 --> 09:49.988
Halide deposits.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.289
That's rock salt, right?

09:51.291 --> 09:53.692
We're 300 miles
from the nearest ocean,

09:53.694 --> 09:54.993
But there are any number

09:54.995 --> 09:56.962
Of mineral deposits
in southern nevada.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.730
Doesn't exactly narrow
it down, does it?
No, it doesn't.

09:58.732 --> 10:01.733
She's a csi.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.868
What the hell
was she doing undercover?

10:03.870 --> 10:06.104
Call me if you find
anything, david.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.940
Doc said he may have found
some dna from the killer

10:08.942 --> 10:10.375
On denise tyler's body.

10:10.377 --> 10:12.877
Is that right?
Yeah, I've got
a dried secretion.

10:12.879 --> 10:14.713
I ran it-- there seems
to be a problem.

10:14.715 --> 10:18.016
The profile seems incomplete;
there's no amelogenin.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.651
Russell:
No sex gene?

10:19.653 --> 10:21.052
How is that even possible?

10:21.054 --> 10:23.755
You know, run it again,
and get greg to help you.

10:28.661 --> 10:30.395
(sighs)

10:37.103 --> 10:38.970
Hey.
Hey.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.106
When did you get back
from san francisco?

10:41.108 --> 10:43.174
A few hours ago.
You were in pd.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.043
Uh, ecklie asked me
to check on larson's story.

10:45.045 --> 10:49.047
According to police records,
angela, aka miss kitty,

10:49.049 --> 10:51.716
Was arrested last year
for solicitation.

10:51.718 --> 10:53.985
Vice made a notation that she
was with an oliver tate.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.921
Cops busted her;
they let tate go.

10:56.923 --> 10:59.424
So larson's telling the truth
about tate knowing angela.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.760
And maybe the blackmail.
I spoke to his

11:01.762 --> 11:04.663
Old boss at philodyne, a biotech
company where he worked.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.398
Tate was fired
for personal indiscretion.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.166
After that,
he was angry

11:08.168 --> 11:11.069
At the company, he was angry
at the cops, at the world.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.337
He became a recluse.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.072
We need to talk to angela.

11:14.074 --> 11:17.042
She's disappeared.

11:46.906 --> 11:49.808
♪

12:15.134 --> 12:17.268
♪

12:26.779 --> 12:28.780
(floor creaks)

12:36.222 --> 12:38.223
How the hell
did you get in here?

12:38.225 --> 12:40.492
Officer downstairs let me up.

12:42.228 --> 12:44.295
You don't want
to shoot the messenger.

12:46.465 --> 12:48.500
Someone left their bible
and a dowel

12:48.502 --> 12:50.335
Outside my hotel door
with that inside.

12:50.337 --> 12:53.171
Instructions to come here.

12:57.042 --> 12:58.810
Finlay:
Quote from dante's <i>inferno.</i>

12:58.812 --> 13:00.311
Inscribed on the gates of hell.

13:08.888 --> 13:12.257
The king said,
"bring me a sword.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.392
"divide the child in two.

13:14.394 --> 13:15.860
"give half to one

13:15.862 --> 13:17.295
And half to the other."

13:17.297 --> 13:23.134
By this wisdom...
Solomon discerned

13:23.136 --> 13:26.037
The worthiness of the one that
would lay claim to the child.

13:26.039 --> 13:29.007
You can only have
one daughter back.

13:31.177 --> 13:32.544
You have a decision to make.

13:32.546 --> 13:35.380
Or the decision
will be made for you.

13:38.117 --> 13:40.218
You have six hours.

13:45.891 --> 13:47.892
You can only have
one daughter back.

13:47.894 --> 13:49.460
You have a decision to make.

13:49.462 --> 13:52.864
Or the decision
will be made for you.

13:52.866 --> 13:55.233
You have six hours.

13:56.202 --> 13:57.502
(click, beep)

13:57.504 --> 13:59.504
Has brass seen this?

13:59.506 --> 14:01.105
Yeah.

14:01.107 --> 14:03.208
What I don't understand
is why tate

14:03.210 --> 14:04.542
Is now sending messages

14:04.544 --> 14:06.411
Through you.
Is there anything

14:06.413 --> 14:07.612
You want to tell us?

14:07.614 --> 14:10.915
Maybe he knows who I am,
what I'm doing here.

14:10.917 --> 14:12.250
Finlay:
Wouldn't be
the first time

14:12.252 --> 14:14.152
That a killer reached out
to the press.

14:14.154 --> 14:16.354
He's screwing with us.
He's using my daughter to do it.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.023
He doesn't even say
how we're supposed

14:19.025 --> 14:21.359
To communicate with him.
Finlay: My guess is
we're gonna get

14:21.361 --> 14:22.894
Another flash drive.

14:22.896 --> 14:25.163
Well, when you do,
why not give tate

14:25.165 --> 14:27.365
An answer?
Excuse me?

14:27.367 --> 14:29.033
It is the last
thing he'd expect.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.168
Maybe throw him off his game.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.637
And as I recall, the
last time you were here,

14:32.639 --> 14:34.572
You two convinced me
to send my daughter

14:34.574 --> 14:36.007
Into the arms
of a killer.

14:36.009 --> 14:38.109
I don't think that's quite fair.

14:38.111 --> 14:40.211
No, no. You're right.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.980
'cause I'm the one
who made that call.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.882
But you two don't have
to live with it.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.350
I know you said

14:45.352 --> 14:46.651
We got nothing,
but we better find

14:46.653 --> 14:48.920
Something soon.

14:52.491 --> 14:55.293
Or the decision
will be made for you.

14:56.996 --> 14:59.030
She keeps looking up.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.164
Here, watch this.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.233
You have six hours.

15:03.168 --> 15:05.003
Russell:
She keeps looking up.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.204
Why is she doing that?

15:06.206 --> 15:08.506
Well, she's struggling,
she's under duress.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.508
No, she's stronger
than that.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.243
And she's smart.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.045
Like you.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.914
Why would you be looking up?

15:15.916 --> 15:18.383
I would look up
to send a message.

15:21.186 --> 15:22.921
Nancy:
Did you see
ellie on the video?

15:22.923 --> 15:24.555
No, just morgan,
but we have to believe

15:24.557 --> 15:26.391
That ellie's still alive.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.195
If you had to choose...

15:31.197 --> 15:32.597
We don't have to choose.
There's no choosing.

15:32.599 --> 15:33.598
This isn't real, nancy.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.666
I know. I'm just saying.

15:34.668 --> 15:36.668
Ellie is my daughter.

15:36.670 --> 15:38.469
She's my little girl.

15:38.471 --> 15:41.940
But she's not
a little girl.

15:41.942 --> 15:43.675
She's-she's not...

15:43.677 --> 15:46.010
Six years old.
(sighs)

15:46.012 --> 15:49.414
Look, I understand.

15:49.416 --> 15:52.684
The first six years
we were all together,

15:52.686 --> 15:54.953
You were a great father.

15:54.955 --> 15:57.088
You were a great husband.
You were a better man.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.156
Until I screwed it up.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.657
We screwed it up.

15:59.659 --> 16:02.627
So what chance
did ellie have

16:02.629 --> 16:04.996
But to do the same thing?

16:04.998 --> 16:06.331
Gun to your head,

16:06.333 --> 16:08.366
You'd choose
the other girl, right?

16:09.702 --> 16:12.270
If we get her back,

16:12.272 --> 16:15.440
You have to love her
not for who she was

16:15.442 --> 16:17.375
But for who she is.

16:23.515 --> 16:26.517
All this time, all these years,
I've been searching for ellie

16:26.519 --> 16:28.720
When she didn't
want to be found.

16:29.688 --> 16:32.023
I thought, by my sacrifice,

16:32.025 --> 16:34.525
I could prove to myself
that I still loved her.

16:34.527 --> 16:37.362
But you're right.

16:37.364 --> 16:40.398
I'd choose the other girl.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.699
Stokes:
You know, maybe she's trying

16:41.701 --> 16:43.401
To draw our attention
to something else

16:43.403 --> 16:45.536
In the room.
You know, that's what
I thought at first.

16:45.538 --> 16:46.671
But check this out.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.539
Every single time

16:48.541 --> 16:51.542
Morgan looks up, there's
a spike on the audio track.

16:51.544 --> 16:53.745
Brody:
You have six hours.
Maybe if I can isolate it.

16:53.747 --> 16:56.381
(beep, whirring)

16:59.351 --> 17:02.387
(beep, low rumbling)

17:02.389 --> 17:04.155
Low frequency.

17:04.157 --> 17:05.289
Power lines?

17:05.291 --> 17:08.026
Yeah, but it surges.
Then it dissipates.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.128
(rumbling continues)

17:10.130 --> 17:11.129
Doppler effect.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.230
It's moving.

17:12.232 --> 17:13.564
Could be an engine.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.433
Nick:
It sounds like a jet.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.301
And it's close
to the ground.

17:17.303 --> 17:19.604
Taking off or landing?

17:19.606 --> 17:22.073
If we can I.D.
This audio,

17:22.075 --> 17:24.208
We might be able
to I.D. The plane.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.744
There are several airports
around the vegas area,

17:26.746 --> 17:28.346
Including nellis
air force base.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.415
Yeah, and if we run it
against faa flight logs

17:30.417 --> 17:33.051
From the time of the recording,
we could have our flight path.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.119
And we can narrow down
the search area.

17:36.488 --> 17:37.789
I processed the dowels
in the boat.

17:37.791 --> 17:39.290
They were clean,
just like the ones

17:39.292 --> 17:41.092
That you guys have been
finding in the bibles.

17:41.094 --> 17:43.327
If that's a sequence, I'm
not sure where to begin.

17:43.329 --> 17:44.595
It's ternary code.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.064
Like binary code
but instead of just having

17:46.066 --> 17:48.066
Zeros and ones,
you have zeros, ones

17:48.068 --> 17:50.334
And twos.
You're talking
about digital encryption?

17:50.336 --> 17:51.636
I'm also talking about dna.

17:51.638 --> 17:52.770
In this case.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.505
Finn found this

17:54.507 --> 17:55.773
In tate's condo.

17:55.775 --> 17:59.177
Synthetic dna
in saline solution.

17:59.179 --> 18:00.645
An exact match
to the dna

18:00.647 --> 18:03.081
We thought was sweat
from our killer.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.083
Engineered for
data storage.

18:05.085 --> 18:06.851
That sounds
pretty sci-fi.

18:06.853 --> 18:09.720
But tate did work
at a biotech company.

18:09.722 --> 18:13.091
Forget about flash drives--
this is the future.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.625
So let's say that we
wanted to store this

18:14.627 --> 18:17.528
Digitally on
synthetic dna. First,

18:17.530 --> 18:19.130
We would have to translate
the pixels

18:19.132 --> 18:21.199
<i>Into the zeros, ones and twos</i>
<i>of ternary code.</i>

18:21.201 --> 18:23.101
<i>Then we'd transfer</i>
<i>those numbers</i>

18:23.103 --> 18:25.570
<i>Into the nucleic acids of dna.</i>

18:25.572 --> 18:27.371
<i>The information</i>
<i>can be retrieved</i>

18:27.373 --> 18:29.640
<i>As long as you have</i>
<i>the right decryption key.</i>

18:29.642 --> 18:31.309
<i>Tate must have been storing</i>
<i>something important,</i>

18:31.311 --> 18:33.544
Something he wanted to protect.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.546
Well, if the dowels
are a decryption key,

18:35.548 --> 18:37.615
We should be able
to read it, right?

18:37.617 --> 18:39.650
We'd need the biometric scanners
from tate's company.

18:39.652 --> 18:40.651
And a warrant.

18:40.653 --> 18:41.819
So let's get a warrant.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.822
(grunts softly)

18:44.824 --> 18:46.724
(quietly):
We shouldn't
be doing this.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.159
What if he hears us?

18:48.161 --> 18:51.429
Just keep listening.
I almost got this.

18:51.431 --> 18:52.497
(groans)

18:52.499 --> 18:53.764
It's not gonna
work anyway.

18:53.766 --> 18:55.500
We're not giving up.

18:55.502 --> 18:57.702
Just like the people who are
looking for us aren't giving up.

18:57.704 --> 18:59.337
Yeah, right.

18:59.339 --> 19:00.738
Keep on dreaming.
(sighs)

19:00.740 --> 19:02.306
Ellie, I know it seems

19:02.308 --> 19:04.475
Like the world has turned
its back on you,

19:04.477 --> 19:05.810
But it's not the case.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.879
You don't know anything
about me.

19:11.216 --> 19:12.917
I know a lot more
than you think.

19:12.919 --> 19:15.653
I know how much
your dad cares about you.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.356
And how much he misses you
and how he would do anything

19:18.358 --> 19:20.491
To help you.
He's not doing this for me.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.493
You know that
he's not

19:22.495 --> 19:23.761
Even my father?

19:23.763 --> 19:25.830
Yeah, my real dad
is some cop

19:25.832 --> 19:27.698
That my mom hooked
up with at the bar

19:27.700 --> 19:30.568
Trying to get back at him
for all the bitches he banged.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.336
The only thing they
ever agreed upon

19:32.338 --> 19:34.705
Was to lie to me about
it, but I found out.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.341
From some vice cop in jersey

19:37.343 --> 19:40.645
Who busted me
after he screwed me.

19:43.882 --> 19:45.516
(sighs)

19:45.518 --> 19:48.319
I used to hate my dad, too,
you know?
Please.

19:48.321 --> 19:50.688
Just spare me the speech about
how you let go of your past

19:50.690 --> 19:52.590
And learned to accept your dad
for who he was.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.792
All I'm saying
is I've seen your parents.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.727
It isn't what
you think it is.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.663
What are you talking
about, my parents?

19:58.665 --> 20:01.332
Your mom's here.

20:01.334 --> 20:02.633
My mom?

20:02.635 --> 20:04.468
Your dad called her.

20:04.470 --> 20:07.271
They may disagree
about most everything, but...

20:07.273 --> 20:09.740
They both love you.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.609
Well, it doesn't matter
because there's no way

20:11.611 --> 20:13.411
We're gonna make it
out of here alive.

20:19.751 --> 20:22.220
(beeping)

20:22.222 --> 20:24.288
(phone chimes)

20:25.591 --> 20:26.724
Russell.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.593
It's me. Angela.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.561
Angela, where have you been?
We've been looking for you.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.563
There's something
I should have told you

20:32.565 --> 20:34.498
About these murders,
about oliver tate.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.434
I'm scared, mr. Russell.

20:36.436 --> 20:37.835
Tell me where you are right now.

20:37.837 --> 20:40.304
At the fellowship.

20:40.306 --> 20:41.739
All right, angela,

20:41.741 --> 20:43.841
I'm gonna send a team over
to you right now.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.743
No. No, please, mr. Russell.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.546
I don't trust anyone but you.

20:49.514 --> 20:52.350
(sighs)
all right.

20:52.352 --> 20:55.253
All right, okay, I'm on my way.

20:58.757 --> 21:01.826
Angela?

21:26.551 --> 21:28.619
Oh...

21:30.956 --> 21:34.025
Put the phone down.

21:37.296 --> 21:40.698
Phone. On the floor.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.333
Now.

21:42.335 --> 21:44.535
Kick it over here.

21:51.843 --> 21:55.379
Whatever angela
did to you, tate,

21:55.381 --> 21:56.847
She did not deserve this.

21:56.849 --> 21:59.650
Easy for you to say.
She didn't betray you.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.852
What do you want? You want...
You want me to beg? Is that it?

22:01.854 --> 22:03.521
You want me to
choose which girl

22:03.523 --> 22:05.323
Gets to live, you sick...

22:05.325 --> 22:07.825
You really have no idea what
is happening here, do you?

22:07.827 --> 22:10.995
Look, it's just... It's
just you and me right now.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.997
Tell-tell me
what it is you want,

22:12.999 --> 22:14.465
And I... And I'll
get it for you.

22:14.467 --> 22:15.599
I just want the girls back.

22:15.601 --> 22:17.735
For a pair of whores,

22:17.737 --> 22:19.737
You would cast your own soul
into the fire?

22:19.739 --> 22:22.073
I would make a deal
with the devil himself

22:22.075 --> 22:24.108
To get those girls back.

22:24.110 --> 22:26.811
Whatever you think of me,
I am not the devil.

22:26.813 --> 22:29.080
However, I do believe

22:29.082 --> 22:32.983
The devil is within your midst.

22:32.985 --> 22:35.419
Are you talking about larson?

22:35.421 --> 22:37.555
That's kind of funny,
'cause he said

22:37.557 --> 22:38.756
The same thing about you.

22:38.758 --> 22:41.058
Except he's been in
custody for two days.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.594
Kind of hard to kill somebody

22:43.596 --> 22:45.663
When you're behind
bars, isn't it?

22:46.598 --> 22:48.966
Oh, god.

22:48.968 --> 22:51.669
I see.

22:51.671 --> 22:54.138
Those girls are going to die,

22:54.140 --> 22:57.608
And I will be held accountable.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.610
You can't stop it.

22:59.612 --> 23:01.979
And neither can I.

23:07.386 --> 23:10.788
Control, this is
charlie-zero-one, russell.

23:10.790 --> 23:13.023
I need backup at fellowship
of the fallen angels.

23:13.025 --> 23:15.793
I'm in pursuit of oliver tate.

23:15.795 --> 23:17.828
Suspect's driving
a silver taurus.

23:17.830 --> 23:20.531
Thomas-david-henry,
ocean-three-four-seven.

23:20.533 --> 23:21.732
(russell grunts)

23:26.805 --> 23:30.007
(glass clinking,
debris thudding and clinking)

23:41.153 --> 23:43.954
Ecklie:
Oh, god. What the
hell is going on?

23:43.956 --> 23:45.556
I thought we
had our guy.

23:45.558 --> 23:46.757
Brass:
Who says we didn't?

23:46.759 --> 23:48.559
All the signs
still point to tate.

23:48.561 --> 23:52.096
They'll be picking up pieces
of him till tomorrow morning.

23:52.098 --> 23:54.432
I think we're looking
for an accomplice

23:54.434 --> 23:56.801
Who decided to end
the partnership.

23:56.803 --> 23:57.868
I'm not so sure.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.874
Violence.

24:03.876 --> 24:05.443
Ecklie:
What?

24:05.445 --> 24:07.478
Violence.

24:07.480 --> 24:10.448
The scattered remains look
exactly like the engraving.

24:10.450 --> 24:11.749
The seventh circle of hell.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.184
I think that tate
was just the next victim.

24:13.186 --> 24:14.618
Ecklie:
Which means

24:14.620 --> 24:17.188
There are now
only two circles left.

24:17.190 --> 24:19.590
Finlay:
I processed

24:19.592 --> 24:20.724
The bible and the dowel.

24:20.726 --> 24:25.062
But there was a sim card
inside the dowel and...

24:25.064 --> 24:27.565
A message... For you.

24:31.002 --> 24:33.971
The killer wants me
to make a call.

24:33.973 --> 24:36.073
We're set to run

24:36.075 --> 24:39.109
A cell tower trace,
for what it's worth.

24:41.813 --> 24:44.849
(line ringing)

24:44.851 --> 24:46.217
Ellie:
Dad?

24:46.219 --> 24:47.818
Ellie.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.487
It's time.

24:49.489 --> 24:52.523
You have to give me your choice.

24:54.025 --> 24:56.594
Ellie...

24:58.497 --> 25:00.598
Sweetheart...

25:00.600 --> 25:03.901
I can't do that.

25:03.903 --> 25:06.036
I know.

25:13.078 --> 25:14.879
(phone beeps)

25:32.631 --> 25:34.798
John:
I was told
I'd find you here.

25:34.800 --> 25:38.702
I assume this is where
you come for answers.

25:38.704 --> 25:41.105
Given your reputation,
it must work.

25:41.107 --> 25:43.040
Well, it's not working now.

25:46.278 --> 25:51.549
I know it took you 11 months
to find the gig harbor killer...

25:51.551 --> 25:53.551
But you did find him.

25:53.553 --> 25:55.319
After he had already
killed six women.

25:55.321 --> 25:57.922
And here I am now
with seven dead,

25:57.924 --> 26:00.057
And I'm waiting for
another body to drop.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.259
Maybe a member
of my own team.

26:02.261 --> 26:06.196
Or at least the daughter of
someone very close to me, so...

26:12.137 --> 26:14.071
We're trained to
follow the evidence,

26:14.073 --> 26:16.006
But some-sometimes
that's not enough.

26:16.008 --> 26:18.842
There... There are times
when you need to hear that...

26:18.844 --> 26:23.280
That voice in your head
that says, "look here."

26:25.283 --> 26:26.784
Trouble is, when you...

26:26.786 --> 26:29.253
When you've done this job
long enough...

26:29.255 --> 26:32.323
One day,
you stop hearing that voice.

26:32.325 --> 26:34.224
And that day has come?

26:34.226 --> 26:36.226
Sidle:
Russell.

26:37.829 --> 26:39.897
Hey.

26:39.899 --> 26:41.165
You have anything?

26:41.167 --> 26:42.166
Two things.

26:42.168 --> 26:43.167
Doc found skin

26:43.169 --> 26:44.301
Under angela's nails.

26:44.303 --> 26:45.636
She got a piece of her attacker.

26:45.638 --> 26:46.837
Henry ran the dna,
it came back

26:46.839 --> 26:49.273
Unknown male,
so tate is not our killer.

26:49.275 --> 26:52.843
Okay. What-what about
the synthetic dna?

26:52.845 --> 26:55.045
I got the warrant.
I got tate's company

26:55.047 --> 26:56.246
To decrypt the files.

26:56.248 --> 26:57.948
You need to see this.

26:57.950 --> 27:02.786
Tate's been using all his dna
gigabytes for one thing--

27:02.788 --> 27:04.188
Porn.

27:04.190 --> 27:06.890
Guy certainly had a fixation
on the nine circles of hell.

27:06.892 --> 27:08.659
All of our female victims
are here.

27:08.661 --> 27:10.661
Yes, but he wasn't
killing them.

27:10.663 --> 27:12.630
It was sheer fantasy.

27:12.632 --> 27:13.797
Pretty clear, also,

27:13.799 --> 27:15.966
That tate was a watcher,
not a participant.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.235
He was using teenage boys
as sexual surrogates.

27:18.237 --> 27:21.271
Some of them were pretty young.

27:21.273 --> 27:23.140
Our killer, whoever it is,

27:23.142 --> 27:27.044
Left us evidence
of tate's perversions, right?

27:27.046 --> 27:30.280
He's been talking
to us in-in puzzles, in-in code.

27:30.282 --> 27:33.350
Like the-the message...

27:33.352 --> 27:35.653
The message on the body.

27:38.289 --> 27:41.358
<i>"barb... Thee... Thorns."</i>

27:44.929 --> 27:47.064
<i>It's an anagram.</i>

27:53.304 --> 27:54.872
That's from dante's <i>inferno.</i>

27:54.874 --> 27:58.375
"who is in yon fire, that comes
so parted at the summit,

27:58.377 --> 28:00.678
"as it seem'd, ascending

28:00.680 --> 28:02.212
"from that funeral pile

28:02.214 --> 28:05.149
Where lay the theban brothers."

28:05.151 --> 28:07.017
"barb... Thee... Thorns."

28:07.019 --> 28:08.419
Theban brothers.

28:08.421 --> 28:13.157
Cursed for life because
of the sins of their father.

28:13.159 --> 28:15.693
See, I think we're looking
for brothers that tate used.

28:15.695 --> 28:16.994
Hey, henry!

28:16.996 --> 28:18.162
Come here.

28:18.164 --> 28:20.230
The skin you got
under angela's nails--

28:20.232 --> 28:21.465
Run it against jake.

28:30.275 --> 28:32.176
Hey, d.B.
Hi.

28:32.178 --> 28:35.279
So, it turns out your
hunch was right.

28:35.281 --> 28:37.147
Dna confirmed it.

28:37.149 --> 28:40.184
Angela's killer was a
familial match to jake.

28:40.186 --> 28:43.287
Meet his brother--
matthew tarland.

28:43.289 --> 28:45.155
I pulled a print off
the trigger remote

28:45.157 --> 28:47.257
That was used in the
bomb to kill tate.

28:47.259 --> 28:51.161
It turns out that his
brother there, matthew,

28:51.163 --> 28:53.931
Was busted a couple of years ago
for solicitation.

28:55.300 --> 28:57.067
There's no way this
dude's gonna roll over

28:57.069 --> 28:58.302
On his own
flesh and blood.

28:58.304 --> 29:00.104
All we have him on right now

29:00.106 --> 29:02.773
Is driving around the block,
and he knows it.

29:02.775 --> 29:04.041
I just... I just don't see

29:04.043 --> 29:06.310
He and his brother going
to all this trouble

29:06.312 --> 29:09.179
Without wanting the world
to know what tate did to them,

29:09.181 --> 29:11.048
Why tate had to be punished.

29:11.050 --> 29:13.751
Why we all had to be punished,
for that matter.

29:13.753 --> 29:15.252
Mm-hmm.

29:15.254 --> 29:19.089
No, he wants to confess.

29:19.091 --> 29:21.191
Just not to us.

29:21.193 --> 29:23.894
Larson:
When they came to me,
I proclaimed your innocence.

29:23.896 --> 29:25.329
Even though you'd just planted

29:25.331 --> 29:27.865
A big, fat, red judas smack
on my cheek,

29:27.867 --> 29:29.299
I said, "no.

29:29.301 --> 29:31.468
"he could never have committed
these heinous crimes

29:31.470 --> 29:36.073
"because only one man lives
in such dark places.

29:36.075 --> 29:38.008
Oliver tate."

29:38.010 --> 29:39.910
Well, you would know.
You pimped to him.

29:39.912 --> 29:41.111
Yes, I did.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.947
Is that why
you bore false witness

29:43.949 --> 29:46.083
Against me?

29:46.085 --> 29:47.384
I don't know
what you're talking about.

29:47.386 --> 29:48.952
Yeah, you do, jake.

29:48.954 --> 29:52.456
You know what you've done--
you and your brother.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.091
It seems to me,

29:54.093 --> 29:57.261
Your brother's kind of left you
holding the bag.

29:57.263 --> 30:01.064
And the lord
said unto cain,

30:01.066 --> 30:03.033
"where is abel thy brother?"

30:03.035 --> 30:05.102
And he said, "I know not.

30:06.237 --> 30:08.472
Am I my brother's keeper?"

30:08.474 --> 30:11.108
Am I my brother's keeper?

30:13.378 --> 30:15.312
A boy came to me once.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.147
A little boy.

30:17.149 --> 30:20.350
He'd been cast out onto
the street with his brother

30:20.352 --> 30:24.054
By a man who, father-like,
promised them everything...

30:24.056 --> 30:25.522
(panting)

30:25.524 --> 30:27.558
...But instead...

30:27.560 --> 30:29.993
Used them.

30:29.995 --> 30:32.029
Twisted their souls.

30:32.031 --> 30:35.032
Do you remember that boy?

30:35.034 --> 30:37.367
Yes, I do.

30:37.369 --> 30:39.436
But he's... Dead.
I think

30:39.438 --> 30:41.505
There is still love
in your heart.

30:41.507 --> 30:44.041
Not for me,

30:44.043 --> 30:46.410
But for someone...

30:46.412 --> 30:49.880
Someone who gave that life
to you unconditionally,

30:49.882 --> 30:53.250
Who's been repaid in blood.

30:56.354 --> 30:59.389
I think you need
to look at this.

31:01.259 --> 31:03.327
Recognize
your brother's work?

31:05.530 --> 31:07.331
You're lying.

31:07.333 --> 31:09.566
This is a trick.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.635
No, matthew would never...

31:11.637 --> 31:14.571
He-he knows how much
I care about angela. No.

31:14.573 --> 31:17.241
Jake, your brother killed her.

31:17.243 --> 31:19.977
He posed her just like
all the other girls.
No!

31:19.979 --> 31:21.545
You are your
brother's keeper.

31:21.547 --> 31:24.281
You are responsible
for what he's done

31:24.283 --> 31:26.416
And what he will do
to two more girls

31:26.418 --> 31:29.353
That have nothing to do
with what happened to you.

31:30.455 --> 31:32.990
We know he's in that area
right there.

31:32.992 --> 31:35.125
Larson:
We are all sinners.

31:35.127 --> 31:37.561
We all need redemption.

31:37.563 --> 31:40.497
This is your chance.

31:46.571 --> 31:49.339
(footsteps, ellie
whimpering and groaning)

31:58.583 --> 32:01.084
So, what's the deal
with the mask anyway?

32:01.086 --> 32:04.121
Why are you so scared
to show your face?

32:05.623 --> 32:08.158
You're just going
to kill us.

32:08.160 --> 32:11.528
Or is that it?

32:11.530 --> 32:13.530
You don't have the guts

32:13.532 --> 32:15.966
To look us in the eye
when you do it.

32:20.104 --> 32:22.105
This what you wanted?

32:22.107 --> 32:23.674
Take a good look.
It's the last thing

32:23.676 --> 32:26.109
You're going to see.

32:26.111 --> 32:28.712
I'm going
to make you feel everything.

32:29.380 --> 32:30.447
(groaning)

32:35.486 --> 32:37.087
Lock him up.

32:41.459 --> 32:43.226
Wait.
What?

32:43.228 --> 32:44.995
I think there might be
another girl.

32:44.997 --> 32:46.296
What do you mean?

32:46.298 --> 32:48.398
When he had me on the phone,
I think I heard

32:48.400 --> 32:50.133
Another girl.
Are you sure? Where?

32:50.135 --> 32:52.336
I don't know.
Maybe in another room.

32:53.304 --> 32:55.639
Run! I'll catch up.

32:57.408 --> 32:59.509
Hello?

33:00.511 --> 33:02.579
Anybody in here?

33:20.298 --> 33:22.699
(gun cocks)

33:22.701 --> 33:25.202
Come down here.

33:38.182 --> 33:40.617
Get down on your knees.

33:51.229 --> 33:54.531
Told you I was gonna
make you feel everything.

No!

34:02.574 --> 34:03.807
(gagging, grunting)

34:03.809 --> 34:06.376
Let her go.

Thank you
for coming back for me.

34:59.831 --> 35:01.565
What do you got?

35:01.567 --> 35:02.766
He's dead, jim.

35:04.469 --> 35:06.203
Brass:
Ellie.
Ellie: Dad.

35:06.205 --> 35:09.172
He shot her. I tried to
get the gun from him,

35:09.174 --> 35:11.808
But I couldn't-- he was
too strong, and he...
It's okay. It's okay.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.577
Her pulse is weak,
but she's alive.

35:13.579 --> 35:15.579
Control, this is
captain brass.

35:15.581 --> 35:17.214
Officer down.

35:17.216 --> 35:19.316
Need medevac.
My location. Code three.

35:20.751 --> 35:23.420
(siren wailing)

35:26.891 --> 35:29.860
Ellie said morgan
got the girls out of there,

35:29.862 --> 35:32.195
But matthew just...
Chased 'em down,

35:32.197 --> 35:34.297
Shot morgan right in the back.

35:34.299 --> 35:35.732
Stokes:
Then he tackles her,

35:35.734 --> 35:39.169
There's a struggle,
the gun drops, she shoots him.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.671
What about morgan?

35:41.673 --> 35:43.473
In surgery.

35:43.475 --> 35:46.676
Doctors say anything?
Nothing yet.

35:52.884 --> 35:54.718
Finished the trace reports.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.486
Morgan's in surgery,

35:56.488 --> 35:57.854
So I thought I'd...
Go.

35:57.856 --> 35:59.689
Thanks.

35:59.691 --> 36:02.359
It's a good thing the
kid was a bad shot.

36:02.361 --> 36:03.760
Ellie was lucky, too.

36:03.762 --> 36:07.230
You know, she only got off
the one round, the kill shot.

36:07.232 --> 36:08.765
I found, um...

36:08.767 --> 36:11.234
Debris...
In the firing mechanism.

36:11.236 --> 36:13.603
Maybe from the struggle.

36:13.605 --> 36:15.739
Kid on top of her,
wrestling in the dirt.

36:15.741 --> 36:17.607
On top of her?

36:17.609 --> 36:19.442
Don't think so--
at least not

36:19.444 --> 36:20.744
When ellie
fired the gun.

36:20.746 --> 36:22.445
There was no gsr
on his shirt.

36:22.447 --> 36:25.182
She had to be at least
four feet away from him.

36:26.617 --> 36:28.518
Traumatic event.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.620
People remember things
differently, I guess.

36:30.622 --> 36:32.489
Not that differently.

36:32.491 --> 36:33.790
Call me from the hospital, okay?

36:33.792 --> 36:38.528
Nick found matthew tarland's
cell phone at the scene, right?

36:38.530 --> 36:40.397
Yeah. I'm going over
his e-mails now.

36:40.399 --> 36:41.665
Okay, forget
the e-mails for now.

36:41.667 --> 36:43.400
I need to see the photos
right away.

36:43.402 --> 36:45.669
What are you
looking for?
I'll know when I see it.

36:48.272 --> 36:49.906
Whoa. That's ellie brass
with our killer.

36:50.975 --> 36:54.411
Uh, metadata says the photos
were taken a year ago

36:54.413 --> 36:56.213
In jersey city.
Nancy told brass
that ellie

36:56.215 --> 36:57.914
Brought a guy home
with her last year,

36:57.916 --> 36:59.416
Said that he was her fiancé.

36:59.418 --> 37:01.952
Wait, so brass's daughter
knew matthew tarland?

37:01.954 --> 37:03.653
She's been lying to us.

37:05.256 --> 37:07.524
D.B., we have a situation.

37:07.526 --> 37:09.359
Is brass still at the hospital?

37:10.628 --> 37:13.330
When did he leave?

37:16.834 --> 37:18.635
Hey. It's me.

37:18.637 --> 37:20.637
Got some moo goo gai pan.

37:20.639 --> 37:22.606
Your guys' favorite, right?

37:22.608 --> 37:24.774
Nancy?

37:26.711 --> 37:28.778
Ellie?

37:34.852 --> 37:36.920
Nancy?

37:51.502 --> 37:53.503
Ellie?

37:53.505 --> 37:55.372
Right here, dad.

37:55.374 --> 37:58.541
(phone ringing)

37:58.543 --> 38:00.010
You gonna get that?

38:00.012 --> 38:02.279
(phone continues ringing)

38:02.281 --> 38:04.047
You shouldn't have dragged mom
out here.

38:04.049 --> 38:05.882
She saw me with matthew.

38:05.884 --> 38:07.350
I had no choice.

38:07.352 --> 38:09.519
You should have
just kept this

38:09.521 --> 38:12.289
Between you and me.

38:12.291 --> 38:13.490
Why?

38:13.492 --> 38:16.359
Matthew and jake
had their daddy issues,

38:16.361 --> 38:20.063
And, thanks to you... So do I.

38:20.065 --> 38:22.299
You-you and the
boys-- you did...?

38:22.301 --> 38:24.534
You did this?

38:24.536 --> 38:27.771
When I had you on the phone,

38:27.773 --> 38:30.040
I asked you to make a choice.

38:30.042 --> 38:31.408
Oh, my god.

38:31.410 --> 38:32.942
You tried saving me

38:32.944 --> 38:36.746
My entire life, and you could
have saved me then, but, oh, no.

38:36.748 --> 38:38.848
Like always...

38:38.850 --> 38:40.483
(phone ringing)

38:40.485 --> 38:42.319
...You had to be the cop.

38:42.321 --> 38:46.656
Sounds like someone wants to get
your attention pretty bad.

38:46.658 --> 38:49.359
I know what that's like.

38:49.361 --> 38:51.394
(phone continues ringing)

38:51.396 --> 38:55.332
You killed the only
person I ever loved.

38:58.069 --> 39:00.837
The only person
who ever loved you.

39:03.407 --> 39:05.542
Ellie,

39:05.544 --> 39:07.644
You want to shoot me...

39:13.050 --> 39:15.051
...Go ahead.

39:16.053 --> 39:18.388
(voice breaking):
Because...

39:18.390 --> 39:20.457
I'm dead already.

39:23.661 --> 39:25.729
What happened?

39:25.731 --> 39:27.731
(knocking)
man:
Lapd!

39:31.836 --> 39:34.637
Give me the gun.

39:48.886 --> 39:50.487
(gun thuds onto floor)

39:56.160 --> 39:58.528
(rhythmic beeping)

40:04.735 --> 40:06.469
Hey. Hey, hey.

40:06.471 --> 40:07.737
Dad.

40:07.739 --> 40:10.039
Uh, uh, el-ellie...
Yeah. We know.

40:10.041 --> 40:11.541
She's in custody.
Don't worry.

40:12.877 --> 40:14.878
You are gonna be okay.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.013
(sighs)

40:18.616 --> 40:20.784
But you know what?

40:22.119 --> 40:24.788
You and I really need
to steer clear of hospitals

40:24.790 --> 40:26.689
From now on.

40:33.531 --> 40:35.598
Thought you'd already left.

40:36.700 --> 40:38.902
Not without
saying good-bye.

40:38.904 --> 40:40.737
Did you get your story?

40:40.739 --> 40:42.806
Yes. Yes, I did.

40:42.808 --> 40:44.073
Although it's not really the
story I came here to write.

40:44.075 --> 40:45.942
Should the mayor be worried?

40:45.944 --> 40:48.144
It's not a hatchet job, if
that's what you're thinking.

40:50.147 --> 40:52.916
Doesn't all just go
into the box, does it?

40:55.786 --> 40:57.854
No.

40:59.857 --> 41:02.492
There is one question
I never got to ask you.

41:02.494 --> 41:05.795
That voice inside
your head--

41:05.797 --> 41:09.632
The day that it
does go quiet...

41:09.634 --> 41:12.001
Do you think that that
will bring you peace?

41:13.204 --> 41:16.005
Or will it be a loss
too great to bear?

41:19.577 --> 41:21.578
Man:
And so we gather together today

41:21.580 --> 41:26.015
To mourn the loss
of our sister nancy...

41:26.017 --> 41:28.852
Taken from this life
all too soon.

41:28.854 --> 41:30.854
In grief,

41:30.856 --> 41:33.223
We throw our arms
around our brother jim,

41:33.225 --> 41:37.760
And we pray
that his journey with nancy

41:37.762 --> 41:39.829
To her final
resting place

41:39.831 --> 41:44.701
Will bring them both peace.

41:44.703 --> 41:48.705
The lesson of
job is clear.

41:48.707 --> 41:51.007
Even in a moment of

41:51.009 --> 41:55.011
Immeasurable sorrow
like this one,

41:55.013 --> 41:57.046
We're given a choice.

41:58.916 --> 42:03.186
A choice between the
hopelessness of despair,

42:03.188 --> 42:08.057
And the everlasting
promise of faith.

42:08.059 --> 42:10.126
Faith...

42:10.128 --> 42:12.028
<i>That there is a plan.</i>

42:12.030 --> 42:16.232
<i>And that in times of doubt,</i>
<i>god will speak to us</i>

42:16.234 --> 42:19.302
<i>In a voice that is clear</i>
<i>and true.</i>
