WEBVTT

00:02.080 --> 00:04.048
- Senator Hawkins is in critical condition...
- Officials are trying to determine...

00:04.240 --> 00:05.287
...after being infected...
- ...if this is government-sanctioned...

00:05.520 --> 00:08.410
...by a biological agent.
- ...or the act of Russian rogues...

00:08.600 --> 00:10.921
A staggering development
as it appears connected...

00:11.120 --> 00:12.929
...to the deaths of the 14 CIA agents.

00:13.120 --> 00:14.400
- I'm being framed.
- Yes.

00:14.520 --> 00:15.681
And by the end of the day...

00:15.880 --> 00:18.645
...they'll identify you.
- Anyone could've infected Hawkins.

00:18.840 --> 00:20.683
He shook dozens of hands
at the memorial.

00:20.880 --> 00:24.362
Within hours, they will all have tested
negative for the virus.

00:24.560 --> 00:26.164
You can't know that. This is insane.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.204
You walked into the director's
office and played The Fulcrum.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.243
You are the enemy.

00:31.440 --> 00:34.489
They're crawling over every place
you've ever lived and worked...

00:34.720 --> 00:37.121
...every file, hard drive
like ants on a grasshopper.

00:37.320 --> 00:40.051
- They won't find anything.
- That'll suit their purposes.

00:40.240 --> 00:43.687
Anything they do find, they'll erase,
and say you destroyed evidence...

00:43.880 --> 00:45.166
...to hide your involvement.

00:45.360 --> 00:47.966
And when they eventually restore
what few pieces...

00:48.160 --> 00:50.891
...they do want to be found,
they will not be kind to you.

00:51.080 --> 00:53.447
- You need to get out.
- If I run, I'll look guilty.

00:53.640 --> 00:56.689
- I'll be playing into their hands.
- You're already in their hands.

00:56.880 --> 00:59.326
The only thing they haven't done
is close their fist.

00:59.520 --> 01:01.409
Go. Now.
I'll be there in three minutes.

01:01.600 --> 01:03.887
No.
They can't prove I did anything wrong.

01:04.120 --> 01:07.363
They can call me a criminal,
but I'm not gonna act like one.

01:08.080 --> 01:09.844
Where is Elizabeth Keen?

01:12.080 --> 01:14.606
Harold, a warrant has been issued
for her arrest.

01:14.840 --> 01:17.764
Anyone hiding her will be charged
with aiding a terrorist...

01:17.960 --> 01:19.405
...including you.
- You used me.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.404
You wanted me to know Karakurt
was posing as a reporter.

01:21.640 --> 01:23.290
You wanted me to tell Keen
where to intercept Hawkins.

01:23.520 --> 01:25.887
I don't know
how framing an FBI agent helps you.

01:26.080 --> 01:28.128
Nobody will believe she's an assassin.

01:28.280 --> 01:30.720
- She was at OREA when it blew up.
- So were dozens of others.

01:30.840 --> 01:33.764
Yes, but I'll bet only her prints
are found on the truck bomb.

01:33.960 --> 01:36.884
She'll also test positive for the virus
that killed Hawkins.

01:37.080 --> 01:39.287
- He's not dead.
- Yet.

01:39.480 --> 01:42.529
You won't get away with it.
Keen is a distinguished agent.

01:42.720 --> 01:45.724
Yes, and the daughter
of a Russian KGB asset.

01:47.080 --> 01:48.730
She failed to mention that, did she?

01:48.960 --> 01:50.610
Keen's been hiding secrets from you.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.963
Secrets that clearly implicate her
as an enemy of this country.

01:54.160 --> 01:56.891
She was handpicked
by a notorious fugitive...

01:57.080 --> 01:59.481
...to assist in expanding
his criminal empire.

01:59.720 --> 02:03.167
The two of them have been using this
task force to do Reddington's bidding.

02:03.360 --> 02:07.649
And before you tell me that's crazy,
can you really tell me that isn't true?

02:07.840 --> 02:11.561
- I will never help you do this.
- I don't need your help, Harold.

02:12.240 --> 02:16.290
A simple blood test from Agent Keen will
be as compelling as a signed confession.

02:19.680 --> 02:22.490
The entire area around St. Agnes
has been quarantined...

02:22.680 --> 02:24.921
...and individuals who might have
been exposed...

02:25.160 --> 02:27.322
...have been detained
inside the church.

02:34.360 --> 02:36.010
You have no authority to hold us.

02:36.200 --> 02:39.170
Senator, I know you're upset
but we need everyone's cooperation.

02:39.360 --> 02:42.682
People say Hawkins was infected
with a virus. You think we're infected?

02:42.880 --> 02:45.247
Probably not, but that's why
we set up a mobile lab.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.442
You don't have probable cause
to hold us.

02:47.680 --> 02:50.729
You want a U.S. Senator claiming
wrongful arrest and imprisonment?

02:50.920 --> 02:53.969
Hey, someone just tried to assassinate
a colleague of yours.

02:54.560 --> 02:55.686
Nobody's going anywhere.

02:55.880 --> 03:01.091
But when we're done here, if you want to
file a complaint or a lawsuit, be my guest.

03:01.320 --> 03:04.164
Until then, get back in the line.

03:07.600 --> 03:10.729
- What have you found on the feeds?
- We've been looking at feeds...

03:10.960 --> 03:13.566
...from the moment he arrived
to the moment he collapsed.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.728
We rounded up everyone
he had contact with.

03:15.960 --> 03:19.328
Which means the killer's in this room.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.764
I've assigned Reven Wright...

03:22.920 --> 03:25.002
...to oversee the investigation
of Agent Keen.

03:25.200 --> 03:28.204
- I'm confident she'll follow the facts.
- Those facts are not proven.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.209
You don't want to help us, fine...

03:30.400 --> 03:34.530
...but I don't need to remind you
what will happen if you stand in our way.

03:34.720 --> 03:37.803
You'll be charged with perjury
in the Harbormaster case...

03:38.000 --> 03:40.924
...and leaking privileged
grand-jury proceedings.

03:41.320 --> 03:42.845
And then there's Charlene.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.841
- You need to leave now.
- As for the clinical trial...

03:46.040 --> 03:49.487
...I can't imagine that will continue.
- Did you hear what I said?

03:49.680 --> 03:52.081
You can take your pills
and your clinical trial.

03:52.320 --> 03:55.324
I would rather die than be part of this.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.848
Escort Director Cooper to his car.

04:03.040 --> 04:06.089
I'm placing him on administrative leave
until we're finished here.

04:06.280 --> 04:09.090
And find Elizabeth Keen.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.561
- There must be some mistake.
- That's what I thought.

04:22.760 --> 04:25.923
We ran the samples twice.
Everyone here was negative for the virus.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.247
We missed something.

04:28.440 --> 04:31.762
I have Hawkins on camera from when
he left the car to when he collapsed.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.322
Every single person he came
into contact with tested negative.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.206
All except one.

04:44.560 --> 04:46.085
You were right.

04:48.160 --> 04:50.891
It's all set up. Cooper and Connolly,
I heard them arguing.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.366
He's got it all figured out.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.682
He's presenting evidence,
using my mother...

04:54.880 --> 04:56.689
...making it seem like all I've been
doing is helping you commit crimes.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.247
- Lizzy, are you out?
- I'm leaving now.

04:59.480 --> 05:00.527
Dembe's on his way.

05:00.720 --> 05:03.451
As soon as you're out,
find your way to Illinois and Ridge.

05:03.640 --> 05:06.120
- He'll be there waiting.
- Yeah.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.608
Hello, Agent Keen.

05:12.760 --> 05:14.125
We've been looking for you.

05:32.040 --> 05:35.522
I want the chain of custody
for that sample fully accounted for...

05:35.720 --> 05:39.167
...and I want someone from my task force
to oversee it and confirm results.

05:39.400 --> 05:42.927
Suspects don't get to dictate process,
Agent Keen.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.046
You need to listen to me.
I'm being framed.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.480
You left the OREA building minutes
before it was bombed.

05:48.680 --> 05:52.685
Yes, and so did my partner!
At no point was I ever near that truck!

05:52.880 --> 05:56.441
Maybe not that morning, but your
partial prints were on the device.

05:56.680 --> 05:59.081
- That's not possible.
- We'll get you the report.

05:59.280 --> 06:02.523
I'm sure that's what it says
because, as I told you, I'm being framed.

06:02.720 --> 06:05.963
Okay, Agent Keen,
who exactly is setting you up?

06:06.160 --> 06:09.084
Because from where I sit,
they're doing a damn good job of it.

06:12.280 --> 06:15.887
There's an organization
known as the Cabal.

06:16.080 --> 06:21.325
A conspiracy formed by world leaders
from the government to the private sector.

06:21.560 --> 06:23.881
Conspiracy? Really?

06:24.640 --> 06:26.688
You should be questioning
Tom Connolly.

06:26.880 --> 06:29.247
Cut the crap.
We know who you are.

06:29.440 --> 06:31.602
- Where were you born?
- I was raised in Nebraska.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.724
That's not what I asked.
You were born in Moscow.

06:34.920 --> 06:38.527
Your mother was a KGB agent
named Katarina Rostova.

06:38.720 --> 06:41.803
Your adopted father had a criminal past
you failed to mention.

06:42.040 --> 06:44.008
- What is your birth name?
- What?

06:44.200 --> 06:45.247
Your birth name?

06:45.800 --> 06:49.168
For most people,
that's a pretty simple question.

06:49.360 --> 06:54.127
I never knew my biological parents
and my memories were blocked.

06:54.320 --> 06:56.402
- You expect us to believe that?
- I don't care.

06:56.640 --> 07:01.806
Intel indicates the existence of a
Russian sleeper agent within the FBI.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.128
Then maybe you should go out
and look for him.

07:04.360 --> 07:06.010
We know the truth, Masha.

07:06.200 --> 07:09.602
That's your real name, isn't it?
Masha Rostova.

07:09.800 --> 07:13.327
- Answer the question, Agent Keen.
- You wanted to see me?

07:13.520 --> 07:15.522
Let's go back to OREA, the bombing.

07:15.720 --> 07:18.644
- We know...
- I just received word.

07:18.840 --> 07:20.490
Senator Hawkins is dead.

07:23.560 --> 07:25.688
There's no evidence the man
we're holding is Karakurt.

07:25.920 --> 07:28.890
Main justice verified his credentials.
He's just a reporter.

07:29.080 --> 07:30.286
Maybe Cooper could...

07:30.480 --> 07:33.245
Agent Cooper was relieved of duty
by the Attorney General...

07:33.440 --> 07:35.488
...until my inquiry is complete.

07:35.880 --> 07:38.121
This is unbelievable.
They're taking him out too.

07:42.680 --> 07:46.480
Look, I don't know
Agent Keen well at all.

07:46.680 --> 07:48.728
Maybe she is
what they're saying she is.

07:48.920 --> 07:52.766
But Harold Cooper, you remove a man
like that, and you get me wondering.

07:52.960 --> 07:56.442
Which is why I'm naming you
as acting director of this task force.

07:56.640 --> 08:01.089
I need a right hand on this,
one I can trust.

08:02.120 --> 08:05.169
So you want me to investigate
my partner?

08:05.360 --> 08:08.170
You're an agent who puts
a premium on doing what's right.

08:08.360 --> 08:11.170
You want to give Keen
the benefit of the doubt? Good.

08:11.920 --> 08:14.400
But if she is guilty,
I know you'll do what it takes...

08:14.600 --> 08:16.602
...to hold her accountable
and make the case.

08:19.760 --> 08:24.129
Sorry to interrupt.
Agent Keen's blood test just came in.

08:24.320 --> 08:27.722
She tested positive for the virus
that killed Senator Hawkins.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.884
I've been relieved of duty.

08:45.080 --> 08:47.128
I'm not surprised.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.850
And Connolly's minions
are questioning Agent Keen.

08:51.040 --> 08:53.646
The man has the weight
of the entire D.O.J. behind him...

08:53.880 --> 08:56.281
...if he wants to indict her.
- There won't be an indictment.

08:56.480 --> 08:58.403
They'll rig the evidence against her...

08:58.640 --> 09:02.087
...parade her in front of the cameras
so America can see the enemy...

09:02.280 --> 09:04.009
...and then put her away someplace...

09:04.200 --> 09:06.328
...where she has no chance
to mount a defense.

09:06.560 --> 09:09.404
- I have to go back.
- You won't be allowed in the building.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.967
- We can't just leave her there.
- Of course not.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.242
We're gonna walk her
right out the door.

09:15.720 --> 09:18.291
- You have someone on the inside?
- Yes.

09:18.480 --> 09:21.290
Fortunately, I also have a man
at the power company.

09:21.480 --> 09:25.644
The lines will be cut to both the main
and emergency power supplies.

09:25.840 --> 09:28.730
Battery boot protocol
will recycle within 60 seconds.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.122
It'll take another 30
for the cameras to cycle.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.527
That's 90 seconds
for Agent Keen to get out.

09:33.760 --> 09:36.889
With your guidance, Harold,
that's all the time she'll need.

09:37.080 --> 09:39.162
I'll check it out. Stay put.

09:39.360 --> 09:41.931
You want me
to guide her out in the dark?

09:42.120 --> 09:45.647
In the land of the blind,
the one-eyed man is king.

09:45.840 --> 09:49.083
Let me guess, Reddington's coming
to break you out.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.521
Agent Keen, I'm to escort you to lock...

09:59.640 --> 10:03.361
Wait! Reddington sent me!
Clock is ticking! It's for you!

10:03.560 --> 10:05.324
- Take it!
- Yes!

10:05.520 --> 10:06.567
Keen, listen closely.

10:06.760 --> 10:10.207
You have 45 seconds before power is up.
I need you to do exactly as I say.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.004
Our power supply's not responding.

10:12.200 --> 10:13.804
- Reddington.
- There's a door...

10:13.960 --> 10:15.121
...by the south stairwell.

10:15.840 --> 10:18.764
My emergency access is 5-tango-293.

10:19.520 --> 10:23.684
Head to the end of the hallway
and make a right, then an immediate left.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.441
Damn it.

10:30.640 --> 10:33.080
From the maintenance room,
there's a utility ladder...

10:33.120 --> 10:35.088
...that dumps into an
emergency passageway.

10:35.320 --> 10:38.085
The stairwell opens to a corridor
connected to the dock.

10:38.320 --> 10:41.847
Go one block west.
Reddington will meet you there.

10:45.320 --> 10:48.483
- Don't do this, Keen.
- They won't listen to me.

10:48.680 --> 10:52.241
- We'll make them listen.
- Did you get my blood test back?

10:54.360 --> 10:55.725
Positive for the virus.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.167
See? They can make anything
look like the truth.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.010
If you run, what does it look like?

11:00.200 --> 11:02.646
If someone's setting you up, you're
giving them exactly what they want.

11:02.840 --> 11:06.367
You can fight this, but you've got to do it
from inside the system.

11:07.320 --> 11:09.721
In about 20 seconds,
that camera will turn back on.

11:11.080 --> 11:14.209
If you're gonna let me go,
you've got to do it now...

11:14.440 --> 11:18.411
...before people see you
standing here with me.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.967
We just missed her. Got a burner.

11:42.160 --> 11:46.085
How could I possibly be carrying
the virus that killed Hawkins?

11:46.280 --> 11:49.443
Infecting you is not something
they'd leave to chance.

11:49.680 --> 11:52.001
They want you alone, isolated.

11:52.480 --> 11:56.280
In the last 24 hours,
what was out of the ordinary?

11:56.520 --> 11:58.921
When did you change your plans,
make a diversion?

11:59.440 --> 12:00.487
Union Station.

12:00.680 --> 12:02.045
Coming out of the tunnel
I was chasing Karakurt.

12:02.280 --> 12:03.930
- He blindsided me.
- To infect you.

12:04.160 --> 12:05.571
We need to pull the security tapes
at Union Station.

12:05.760 --> 12:09.242
If we can find footage of Karakurt,
maybe we can prove they infected me.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.249
He's insisting.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.408
- Yes?
- Where's Liz? I can't reach her.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.762
- Can't help you with that.
- I can keep her safe.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.161
I can help her disappear.

12:17.760 --> 12:19.808
Your assistance is not necessary.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.321
- Who was that?
- Tom.

12:22.520 --> 12:27.321
Tom is calling to take you away,
start a new life with a new identity.

12:28.960 --> 12:32.487
But if you run now,
before clearing your name...

12:32.680 --> 12:35.729
...there is no place you can go
where they won't find you.

12:35.920 --> 12:38.366
Face this now...

12:38.560 --> 12:39.766
...fight it...

12:39.960 --> 12:42.486
...and you'll be free
to make any choice you want.

12:52.760 --> 12:55.001
I'll meet you back here
after you get the tapes.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.931
- What are you doing?
- I have an appointment.

12:58.120 --> 13:01.647
This is a war
that must be fought on many fronts.

13:01.880 --> 13:05.407
You have yours. I have mine.

13:07.840 --> 13:09.251
Be safe.

13:15.160 --> 13:18.801
We have three broad-spectrum
frequency jammers being off-loaded now.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.241
- You want to run them from the catwalks?
- Yes.

13:21.480 --> 13:24.131
Space this size,
no communications will get in or out.

13:24.360 --> 13:25.407
I'm confident of that.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.410
I don't need to tell you
there is no margin for error.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.523
That's correct. You do not.

13:30.720 --> 13:32.131
- What's the word from Baz?
- He's trying.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.080
- Trying?
- Some targets you selected...

13:34.240 --> 13:37.080
...are thousands of miles away.
They have to be secured and transported.

13:37.120 --> 13:40.283
I was very clear, whatever it takes,
whatever resources are required.

13:40.480 --> 13:42.642
- Of course.
- We get one chance to strike first.

13:42.880 --> 13:45.042
We will not get another.

13:51.400 --> 13:53.846
I'm dying, Agent Keen.

13:55.480 --> 13:57.050
Charlene told me.

13:58.840 --> 14:00.569
She swore me to secrecy.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.522
I let Tom Connolly
take advantage of that.

14:07.600 --> 14:12.242
He offered me hope.
But in exchange, I did things for him.

14:19.760 --> 14:23.401
You once told me that I was
the one person you completely trusted.

14:24.160 --> 14:28.688
I violated that trust.
I'm sorry, Elizabeth.

14:36.440 --> 14:41.082
This thing you're going through...

14:42.480 --> 14:46.087
...ever since Charlene told me,
I've had a pit in my stomach.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.409
I just...

14:51.720 --> 14:53.609
I can't imagine...

15:00.120 --> 15:01.645
Pull yourself together, Keen.

15:01.840 --> 15:03.365
What little time I have left...

15:03.560 --> 15:06.723
...I don't want to spend it sitting
in a car, blubbering with you.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.601
Okay.

15:20.160 --> 15:21.207
I'm with the FBI.

15:21.440 --> 15:23.761
We're chasing a lead
on the recent OREA bombing.

15:23.960 --> 15:25.689
We believe the perp fled...

15:25.880 --> 15:28.486
...through Union Station
as recently as this morning.

15:29.640 --> 15:32.450
- We're gonna need to look at your feeds.
- You got legal paper?

15:32.600 --> 15:34.125
Uh...

15:35.760 --> 15:37.489
Subpoena? I can't release the footage.

15:37.680 --> 15:39.569
- You've got to be joking.
- What?

15:39.760 --> 15:41.091
A subpoena?

15:41.280 --> 15:44.727
We've got a terrorist out there
who just killed 14 CIA agents.

15:44.960 --> 15:48.009
He murdered a sitting U.S. Senator.
And you want to talk about paperwork?

15:49.440 --> 15:52.171
- Salestrom.
- This is Simpson, heads-up.

15:52.360 --> 15:53.964
Somebody from the Bureau's coming.

15:54.160 --> 15:57.004
- They need to look at surveillance.
- I have someone here now.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.726
They need to move quickly.
Give her whatever she needs.

16:03.320 --> 16:05.243
- I appreciate the help.
- Of course.

16:05.480 --> 16:07.084
Drives are archived after midnight.

16:07.320 --> 16:10.927
Anything from earlier today
is gonna have to be accessed from here.

16:11.760 --> 16:13.250
Good luck.

16:31.880 --> 16:33.530
Andropov.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.566
Authorities have released...

16:53.720 --> 16:56.644
...this photo of the suspect,
FBI Agent Elizabeth Keen.

16:56.840 --> 17:00.526
Sources are confirming
she is also wanted in connection...

17:00.720 --> 17:03.166
...with the truck bombing
at the CIA's OREA facility.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.721
- It was Andropov.
- The virologist? He infected you?

17:10.960 --> 17:12.007
He was there.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.248
We have to find Andropov
and get him to talk.

17:14.440 --> 17:17.125
I can't.
I just got a call from our lawyer.

17:17.319 --> 17:20.688
- Charlene's been taken in for questioning.
- Questioning for what?

17:20.880 --> 17:21.961
Tom Connolly.

17:22.160 --> 17:25.003
He got her to... She leaked
a classified document to the press.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.567
But what it means is I can't...

17:27.760 --> 17:30.570
You're gonna have to find Andropov
on your own.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.682
Anton Velov? Agent Keen, FBI.

17:34.880 --> 17:37.611
We spoke briefly
on the phone a few days ago.

17:37.800 --> 17:38.926
Keen.

17:39.160 --> 17:43.484
You were looking for information
about Katarina Rostova.

17:43.680 --> 17:46.604
- Is that why you're here?
- Not entirely, no.

17:46.800 --> 17:50.441
Good. Because if you were,
you have wasted your time.

17:50.640 --> 17:53.450
As I told you, I never knew Katarina.

17:56.080 --> 17:59.084
I need you to tell me
where I can find Leo Andropov.

18:00.360 --> 18:01.486
How should I know?

18:01.720 --> 18:04.849
You were a C.l. for one of the
OREA agents that died in the bombing.

18:05.040 --> 18:08.681
You recorded a conversation for him
that took place here in this restaurant...

18:08.880 --> 18:13.966
...and we know Andropov was a part of it. So
I'll ask you again, where can I find him?

18:18.200 --> 18:21.647
There is a safe house in Ivy City.

18:21.840 --> 18:23.524
A safe house. An address?

18:23.720 --> 18:27.042
I Street, across from Olive's Diner.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.083
Now, if there's nothing else...

18:29.680 --> 18:31.523
That's not
what you told me on the phone.

18:31.720 --> 18:34.007
You said you could help me
with Katarina Rostova.

18:35.440 --> 18:38.569
I don't know anything.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.848
I told you how to find Andropov.

18:41.040 --> 18:43.611
And now I want you
to tell me about her.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.010
I can't say.

18:48.200 --> 18:51.966
First you don't know.
Now you can't say.

18:52.160 --> 18:53.924
Which is it?

18:56.880 --> 18:59.645
- You got to him.
- I retained his services.

18:59.840 --> 19:02.844
In exchange for his silence
about my mother.

19:03.040 --> 19:06.522
Harold told me the man who infected you
was the virologist Andropov.

19:06.720 --> 19:08.768
You got me out of The Post Office.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.241
You gave me a chance
to prove my innocence.

19:11.440 --> 19:13.124
I know you think you care about me.

19:13.320 --> 19:16.449
But every time you do something
that makes me think you really do...

19:16.640 --> 19:20.486
...you do something else that reminds me
that you simply aren't capable of it.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.081
I'm a sin eater.

19:24.280 --> 19:28.524
I absorb the misdeeds of others,
darkening my soul to keep theirs pure.

19:28.720 --> 19:30.688
That is what I'm capable of.

19:30.880 --> 19:34.521
What sin of mine could you
possibly have absorbed?

19:35.280 --> 19:37.362
Andropov. Do you have a lead?

19:39.160 --> 19:45.361
I do, and I'll handle it on my own
because that's what I'm capable of.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.604
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

20:14.800 --> 20:18.771
I have a lead, something that could
clear all of this up, but I need your help.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.088
I went to your motel.
Cops were everywhere.

20:21.320 --> 20:25.803
It's on the TV, news reports.
There is no clearing it up, all right?

20:26.000 --> 20:28.128
- There is only leaving it behind.
- I can't.

20:28.320 --> 20:31.403
If I run now, I'll be looking over
my shoulder the rest of my life.

20:31.600 --> 20:35.127
- That's Reddington talking.
- Yes, it is.

20:35.320 --> 20:40.406
- And he's right. I can't leave now.
- Then I can't stay.

20:44.520 --> 20:47.251
- This lead that I have, Leo Andropov...
- Never heard of him.

20:47.440 --> 20:50.171
He created the virus that killed Hawkins.
He infected me.

20:50.360 --> 20:53.807
If we can find him,
then maybe I can prove I was set up.

20:54.000 --> 20:59.166
But I don't think I can do it on my own.
I've got an address.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.565
He's on the street!

21:26.600 --> 21:28.409
It's me. I've been made.

21:28.640 --> 21:31.723
I'm on my way to the extraction point.

21:46.440 --> 21:48.727
- Turn! Up there on the right!
- Yeah, I see him.

21:48.920 --> 21:49.967
You're losing him.

21:50.200 --> 21:53.249
- Are you telling me how to drive?
- I'm not the one who hit a deer.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.363
That was not deer blood
on the windshield.

21:55.560 --> 21:56.846
Just don't lose him.

22:13.080 --> 22:14.889
He turned down the alley. Circle back.

22:26.160 --> 22:27.889
Where the hell have you been?

22:28.080 --> 22:29.161
We have to go. Now.

22:33.080 --> 22:34.127
What are you doing?

22:46.960 --> 22:49.008
Damn it.

22:53.880 --> 22:57.680
Oh, God! Stay with me! Come on!

23:02.040 --> 23:04.725
My mother, he's the only one
who knew about her.

23:04.920 --> 23:07.366
Liz. Liz, he's gone.

23:27.040 --> 23:28.121
Hello, Mr. Hastings.

23:28.320 --> 23:30.607
I'm here on behalf
of Raymond Reddington.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.447
Tell him that if
he keeps avoiding me he'll regret it.

23:38.640 --> 23:41.484
Mr. Chin, Raymond Reddington
sends his regards.

23:45.560 --> 23:47.483
Last target secured, sir.

23:47.680 --> 23:49.762
Traveling to location.

23:58.440 --> 24:00.408
What?

24:03.440 --> 24:05.488
What?

24:05.680 --> 24:07.444
Today.

24:07.640 --> 24:10.484
- In the alley.
- What about the alley?

24:10.680 --> 24:11.841
It's the weirdest thing.

24:12.040 --> 24:15.886
In that moment with the bullets flying
and the glass...

24:19.440 --> 24:21.647
One thing kept
running through my head.

24:25.200 --> 24:29.489
"The boat, the boat.
Why didn't you just get on his boat?"

24:37.880 --> 24:41.680
- Tell me what to do.
- You're still bleeding.

24:41.880 --> 24:45.009
I'm fine.
Tom, I said I was fine.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.611
I know you did.

25:02.160 --> 25:03.571
That hurt?

25:09.560 --> 25:13.007
What is it? What's wrong?

25:14.280 --> 25:16.487
I don't want to regret anything.

25:17.760 --> 25:19.489
What could you possibly regret?

25:24.560 --> 25:26.801
Not saying yes.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.762
Yes to what?

25:32.640 --> 25:34.005
You.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.082
- Take me with you.
- Don't say that.

25:49.280 --> 25:51.760
I'm here. All we have to do is go.

25:53.120 --> 25:58.763
Liz, if you go away with me,
you'll never get answers.

25:59.920 --> 26:01.763
You'll never find out
who you really are.

26:05.200 --> 26:08.329
I don't need to know who I am
to know what I want.

26:08.520 --> 26:10.648
What do you want, Liz?

26:14.120 --> 26:15.849
You.

26:25.880 --> 26:27.609
At this hour...

26:27.760 --> 26:30.889
...police continue their search
for FBI agent Elizabeth Keen...

26:31.080 --> 26:35.085
...who authorities have deemed
a person of interest in the death...

27:13.520 --> 27:15.329
That a gun or are you
just happy to see me?

27:15.520 --> 27:19.411
The flash drive that we found
in Andropov's safe house...

27:19.600 --> 27:22.490
...it's full of records,
including documents about Cooper.

27:22.680 --> 27:23.727
- Cooper.
- Yeah.

27:23.920 --> 27:27.447
His medical records, test results,
medications, the senator...

27:27.640 --> 27:30.007
...the bombing.
- Liz, slow down.

27:30.200 --> 27:32.282
Cooper's doctor works for the Cabal.

27:34.440 --> 27:36.329
Ah. I'll be back.

27:38.680 --> 27:41.206
No, you won't.

27:42.120 --> 27:43.167
I gotta...

27:44.200 --> 27:48.046
- Tom...
- Go.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.487
Agent Cooper.

27:51.680 --> 27:56.447
Agent Cooper, it's Keen.
I need to see you. It's about your doctor.

27:56.640 --> 27:59.211
- The dye we inserted highlighted...
- Who do you work for?

27:59.440 --> 28:00.930
- I'm in the middle of...
- Get out!

28:01.120 --> 28:02.884
- Harold...
- I know about Andropov.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.048
That the drugs you gave me
came from him.

28:05.920 --> 28:07.640
There never was a clinical trial,
was there?

28:07.720 --> 28:09.688
- No, no.
- It was all a lie.

28:09.880 --> 28:12.247
Please, please, please!
They threatened my family.

28:12.440 --> 28:14.283
Your family?
And what about my family?

28:14.480 --> 28:17.802
- You made me believe I was getting cured!
- No, no, no.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.964
I made you believe you were sick.

28:21.160 --> 28:22.810
Say that again?

28:23.000 --> 28:26.129
You're not sick.

28:26.640 --> 28:29.166
The test results, the brain scans.

28:29.360 --> 28:32.125
- I saw the tumor.
- No, you saw a tumor, but it wasn't yours.

28:32.320 --> 28:35.005
The MRis, the CAT scans,
the blood tests, it was all fake!

28:35.200 --> 28:37.931
- You're lying to me.
- No, no, no! I'm not! I'm not!

28:38.120 --> 28:40.566
But I felt sick. I needed a cane.

28:40.760 --> 28:44.048
Yes. And then you didn't.
It was the medicine.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.207
Andropov, he designed it...

28:49.400 --> 28:52.051
...so that you'd manifest the symptoms
of a glioblastoma.

28:52.240 --> 28:56.325
Then he altered your dosage
to make you think the trial was working.

28:56.520 --> 29:00.161
I don't know why he did it, but he did.
You have to believe me.

29:03.360 --> 29:06.091
There's nothing wrong with you.

29:22.160 --> 29:24.561
My name is Raymond Reddington.

29:25.000 --> 29:29.050
The United States government
has placed me atop the country's list...

29:29.280 --> 29:30.964
...of most-wanted fugitives...

29:31.200 --> 29:34.682
...for a colorful and not
uninteresting assortment of crimes...

29:34.880 --> 29:37.770
...most of which I have committed.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.162
That's who I am.

29:40.360 --> 29:46.163
You, in turn, are by my estimation 11 of
the finest investigative journalists...

29:46.360 --> 29:48.727
...in the world.

29:48.920 --> 29:51.321
I'm here to tell you a story.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.970
I'm sure you recognize
many of the faces behind me.

29:59.080 --> 30:02.880
They are among the most powerful
men and women on the planet.

30:03.400 --> 30:07.883
They are also part
of a global conspiracy...

30:08.080 --> 30:13.041
...a shadow organization
that spans across every continent...

30:13.240 --> 30:15.891
...and has for the last three decades...

30:16.120 --> 30:20.569
...consisting of leaders in world
government and the private sector.

30:20.760 --> 30:23.843
Some call this group "the Cabal."

30:24.040 --> 30:29.843
The world you live in is the world
they want you to think you live in.

30:30.360 --> 30:33.967
They start wars, create chaos.

30:34.160 --> 30:36.686
And when it suits them, they resolve it.

30:37.120 --> 30:41.011
Cabal members will move more money
in the next quarter...

30:41.200 --> 30:44.124
...than the World Bank will
in the next year.

30:44.360 --> 30:49.924
Their alliance affects sea change
in every aspect of human life...

30:50.160 --> 30:53.209
...the value and distribution
of commodities...

30:53.400 --> 30:59.760
...money, weapons, water, fuel,
the food we eat to live...

31:00.000 --> 31:04.722
...the information we rely on
to tell us who we are.

31:04.960 --> 31:07.645
What exactly do you expect us
to do with this information?

31:07.880 --> 31:13.330
Study it, investigate it to determine
the truth and then report it.

31:13.520 --> 31:15.841
Let me be clear.

31:16.040 --> 31:20.364
Investigating this group will immediately
position you as a threat.

31:20.600 --> 31:22.090
If you do what I'm asking...

31:22.280 --> 31:28.606
...you'll be putting your lives and the
lives of those you love at grave risk.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.846
In the end, "The truth will out."

31:32.040 --> 31:38.446
Not all of us will live to see that day
but the truth will out.

31:42.440 --> 31:45.364
Tom, we need to talk.

31:47.560 --> 31:49.608
We don't have anything
to say to each other.

31:49.840 --> 31:53.686
I spoke with Dr. Levin.
He recorded your conversations.

31:56.920 --> 32:01.721
- You got a lot of chutzpah coming here.
- Oh, he's got much more than that.

32:04.600 --> 32:05.840
I have my health.

32:06.440 --> 32:08.966
What a miracle, cancer free.

32:09.160 --> 32:11.083
But then, you know that,
don't you, Tom?

32:11.320 --> 32:13.163
How quickly fortunes can turn.

32:14.440 --> 32:16.522
I wouldn't call your security.

32:16.720 --> 32:19.530
Not until you've heard
what we have to say.

32:19.720 --> 32:20.767
We have the tapes...

32:21.000 --> 32:24.447
...that prove you blackmailed Dr. Levin
into falsifying my medical records.

32:24.640 --> 32:29.043
So here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna make this go away, all of it.

32:29.240 --> 32:32.005
You're gonna exonerate me
by prosecuting Karakurt...

32:32.200 --> 32:35.443
...the real killer of those 14 agents
and Senator Hawkins.

32:35.680 --> 32:38.411
You're going to agree not to press
charges against Charlene.

32:38.640 --> 32:41.928
You're going to reinstate Cooper,
and convey to the Director...

32:42.120 --> 32:44.885
...that he is not to touch
Raymond Reddington.

32:45.080 --> 32:46.650
Why would I agree to any of that?

32:46.840 --> 32:50.003
Because if you refuse,
we'll take the evidence to the Bureau.

32:50.200 --> 32:53.124
- I own the Bureau.
- Then we'll go to a federal judge.

32:53.360 --> 32:55.761
Good luck.
Our river of influence runs deep...

32:55.960 --> 32:59.123
...or have you forgotten how easily
we made Judge Denner suppress...

32:59.320 --> 33:01.800
...first-degree murder charges
against you, Agent Keen?

33:02.040 --> 33:03.804
Look around.
Why do you think I'm here?

33:04.720 --> 33:07.883
There's a banquet tonight,
Fraternal Order of Police.

33:08.080 --> 33:09.366
I'm the keynote speaker.

33:09.560 --> 33:11.608
Four hours from now,
I'll be on that stage...

33:11.840 --> 33:14.889
...announcing that my office
has secured an indictment...

33:15.080 --> 33:17.731
...against the members
of a rogue task force.

33:17.920 --> 33:20.890
This task force was authorized
by the FBI and the D.O.J.

33:21.080 --> 33:23.481
By my predecessor at the D.O.J.

33:25.160 --> 33:26.844
You're going to prison, Agent Keen.

33:27.560 --> 33:32.168
Donald Ressler, his little oxy addiction
will get him drummed out of the Bureau.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.641
Samar Navabi
will be extradited to Iran...

33:34.840 --> 33:39.050
...where she will stand trial for the murder
of one of their top nuclear scientists.

33:39.280 --> 33:44.411
Charlene, Harold,
even Agent Mojtabai.

33:44.600 --> 33:47.001
We have a little something in mind
for all of you...

33:47.200 --> 33:49.885
...including treason
and the death penalty for Reddington.

33:50.080 --> 33:54.324
So are we finished here?
Because I think it's cocktail hour.

33:56.280 --> 33:57.805
Oh, heh!

33:59.040 --> 34:02.328
What are you gonna do, Agent Keen,
arrest me?

34:03.800 --> 34:05.962
Keen, put it down.

34:09.719 --> 34:13.088
I am nothing.
I am a cog in a very large wheel.

34:13.560 --> 34:17.281
Shoot me, and somebody at least
as powerful will take my place.

34:17.480 --> 34:18.766
You just won't know who.

34:18.960 --> 34:22.806
Agent Keen, you do this,
you become everything they say you are.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.364
I can't let him.

34:27.199 --> 34:30.043
Elizabeth, listen to me.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.522
That conversation we had
in my hospital room...

34:32.719 --> 34:35.041
...the good person
I said I didn't want to lose...

34:35.239 --> 34:38.687
...the agent you were before all of this.
You do this and she's gone.

34:54.239 --> 34:55.844
Keen...

35:03.760 --> 35:05.171
Run.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.650
Excuse me.

35:32.160 --> 35:33.207
Ressler.

35:34.440 --> 35:35.487
Where the hell are you?

35:35.680 --> 35:38.445
Listen to me. Harold Cooper
had nothing to do with this.

35:39.120 --> 35:41.851
- You need to turn yourself in.
- You hear me? He's innocent.

35:42.040 --> 35:43.485
You are a wanted fugitive.

35:43.680 --> 35:46.206
You murdered the Attorney General
of the United States.

35:46.400 --> 35:47.447
You have to come in.

35:47.640 --> 35:50.120
- I can't.
- Damn it, Liz, wake up.

35:50.320 --> 35:52.243
You keep running,
you will be hunted down.

35:52.440 --> 35:55.125
- I know.
- By me.

35:55.320 --> 35:56.526
Don't make me do this.

35:56.720 --> 35:59.803
Please, Liz, tell me where you are.
Tell me, and I can get...

36:06.920 --> 36:08.120
- Lizzy.
- I need your help.

36:08.280 --> 36:10.647
- Where are you?
- I killed Tom Connolly.

36:10.840 --> 36:12.604
I know. Where are you?

36:12.800 --> 36:16.168
I'm on, uh, 7th and L, northeast.

36:17.080 --> 36:19.240
I'm gonna call you back in two minutes
with an address.

36:19.320 --> 36:22.244
I need you to get there.
I'm gonna get you out.

36:27.240 --> 36:30.164
It's me. I need to travel.

36:59.120 --> 37:00.451
I remember.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.928
I remember everything.

37:08.240 --> 37:09.685
Remember what?

37:13.400 --> 37:15.562
The night of the fire.

37:16.880 --> 37:19.451
I know what happened...

37:20.720 --> 37:24.930
...and I understand
why you didn't want me to find out.

37:36.080 --> 37:38.731
When I pulled the trigger...

37:39.960 --> 37:42.440
...when I shot Connolly, I...

37:46.600 --> 37:48.728
It came back to me.

37:49.720 --> 37:51.688
It was like I was there.

37:52.800 --> 37:55.371
I could hear them arguing.

37:58.640 --> 38:01.325
He was hurting her.

38:07.720 --> 38:10.121
And I know
why my father died that night.

38:18.880 --> 38:21.281
I shot him.

38:27.720 --> 38:30.883
That's why you blocked my memory.

38:31.240 --> 38:33.607
Not to protect yourself...

38:34.720 --> 38:37.087
To protect me.
