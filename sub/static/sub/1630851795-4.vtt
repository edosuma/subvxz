[narrator]
<i>  this time on moonshiners...</i>

00:08.843 --> 00:12.211
This is popcorn's
old still site
in north carolina.

00:12.213 --> 00:16.148
I ain't never in my life
hauled water
to a still site.

00:16.150 --> 00:18.250
If we stay here,
it's going to kill
our season.

00:18.252 --> 00:19.885
<i> [digger] this is insane.</i>

00:19.887 --> 00:22.321
We've got to get off
this still site
and get closer to home.

00:22.323 --> 00:24.823
<i> [mark] we thought</i>
<i>  we'd put brandy</i>
<i>  into the wine,</i>

00:24.825 --> 00:26.191
make a lot more product,

00:26.193 --> 00:27.326
<i> and a whole lot more of money.</i>

00:27.328 --> 00:29.661
Wouldn't hurt to put a tad
more of that in it.

00:29.663 --> 00:31.830
But we're
down to our last gallon.

00:31.832 --> 00:35.968
And if we could get this
mixed up right, may be up
a creek without a paddle.

00:35.970 --> 00:37.336
[james on phone]
<i>  they said they want</i>
<i>  the green one,</i>

00:37.338 --> 00:38.904
<i>  the absinthe, man.</i>

00:38.906 --> 00:41.106
This guy wants absinthe.
I've never made
anything like this before.

00:41.108 --> 00:44.576
-[richard] that's wormwood.
-Oh, my,
it tastes like a worm.

00:46.414 --> 00:49.415
[mark]
<i>  this is how we make</i>
<i>  the moonshine!</i>

00:49.884 --> 00:51.450
[digger groans]

00:54.288 --> 00:55.854
[mark] have you talked
to daniel?

00:55.856 --> 00:58.824
[digger] I have.
He's going to meet us
up here on the highway.

00:58.826 --> 01:01.126
<i> [narrator] in cocke county,</i>
<i>  tennessee,</i>

01:01.128 --> 01:04.396
<i>  after police raided</i>
<i>  their small warehouse</i>
<i>  still site,</i>

01:04.398 --> 01:07.966
<i>  mark and digger sneak back</i>
<i>  under cover of darkness</i>

01:07.968 --> 01:11.403
<i>  to fill up</i>
<i>  on their most precious</i>
<i>  ingredient.</i>

01:11.405 --> 01:13.372
We got to have
that limestone water.

01:13.374 --> 01:14.306
We got to have it.

01:14.308 --> 01:15.874
The thing about this is

01:15.876 --> 01:18.243
if the chief of police
gets wind of this,

01:18.245 --> 01:21.146
he will bring
the damn vengeance.

01:21.148 --> 01:23.749
One of the big deals
about tennessee whiskey,
as anybody knows,

01:23.751 --> 01:25.350
is limestone water.

01:25.352 --> 01:28.687
<i>  That sweeter water quality</i>
<i>  that goes along with</i>
<i>  limestone water,</i>

01:28.689 --> 01:30.389
<i>  it pairs well with that corn</i>

01:30.391 --> 01:33.025
<i>  and it brings it</i>
<i>  to the forefront</i>
<i>  really strong.</i>

01:33.027 --> 01:35.027
<i>  It's crucial</i>
<i>  we get this water.</i>

01:35.029 --> 01:38.063
If we don't,
we can't make anymore
tennessee whiskey.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.367
[mark] hey, daniel,
how are you doing, boss?

01:42.369 --> 01:45.137
[daniel]
well, I generally know
if you're calling me,

01:45.139 --> 01:46.939
you got something
on your mind, so.

01:46.941 --> 01:49.108
Well,
we're up a stump.

01:49.110 --> 01:51.410
-Okay.
-[digger] we was making
our tennessee whiskey

01:51.412 --> 01:52.878
down there in town.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.913
We got a visit with
the police.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.148
That ain't no good, never.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.749
[digger]
and we've been evicted.

01:57.751 --> 02:00.385
We got a still site, daniel,
across the mountain.

02:00.387 --> 02:02.654
[digger] but we need
this rascal here filled up

02:02.656 --> 02:05.023
with that water, so we can
build a little mash.

02:05.025 --> 02:07.793
[mark]
we'd like to take your truck
with the tote in it.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.128
We'll take it down there

02:09.130 --> 02:11.063
and we'll pump
the water in it.

02:11.065 --> 02:12.731
They don't know your truck

02:12.733 --> 02:16.468
and they won't have
any reason to stop her
and check that truck.

02:16.470 --> 02:20.305
We're just going to stake
you out down there
on top of a building.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.241
If you see
the cops headed our way,

02:22.243 --> 02:23.375
just give us a heads up.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.043
[digger] this is a big ask,
so we got

02:25.045 --> 02:27.913
-the big resolve for it.
-All right.

02:27.915 --> 02:32.050
So we want to bring you in
as a partner on this run
of tennessee whiskey.

02:32.853 --> 02:35.220
I need to know right there,
you in or you out?

02:36.257 --> 02:39.424
Well, hell,
that ain't hard to decide.
I'm in.

02:40.027 --> 02:41.226
Good deal.

02:41.228 --> 02:43.929
[daniel] given the heat
that the local police

02:43.931 --> 02:45.998
and everything has got
on mark and digger,

02:46.000 --> 02:48.367
<i>  it's kind of risky</i>
<i>  doing this for them.</i>

02:48.369 --> 02:51.203
A lot of the times, though,
you'll find out in life

02:51.205 --> 02:53.172
that the risk is worth
the reward.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.108
We're here, boys.

02:56.110 --> 02:59.077
Daniel's role is
he's going to be a lookout.

02:59.079 --> 03:02.414
<i>  If he spots something</i>
<i>  that might be a threat to us,</i>
<i>  he'll let us know</i>

03:02.416 --> 03:04.616
and then we can make
ourselves scarce, hopefully.

03:08.889 --> 03:09.821
[digger] let's get this
[bleep] done.

03:09.823 --> 03:12.024
[mark] yeah.

03:12.026 --> 03:14.993
[daniel] I'm heading up
to this big, tall building,
where I can look down

03:14.995 --> 03:17.462
and make sure that
there's no cops or anything.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.966
<i> [mark] well, the plan</i>
<i>  is digger and I will</i>

03:20.968 --> 03:22.968
<i>  sink the pump in the spring,</i>

03:22.970 --> 03:25.103
pump the water in the tote.

03:25.105 --> 03:27.406
All right,
I'd say the coast is clear.

03:27.875 --> 03:28.941
Got you, man.

03:28.943 --> 03:30.676
You know, pumping water

03:30.678 --> 03:31.910
is not illegal,

03:31.912 --> 03:34.046
<i> but we've already tempted fate</i>

03:34.048 --> 03:36.515
<i>  and we've been warned</i>
<i>  by the chief of police.</i>

03:36.517 --> 03:39.918
We're, kind of,
reneging on our word
by coming back here.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.222
<i>  If the police find us,</i>
<i> we'll be in even more trouble.</i>

03:43.224 --> 03:45.891
[mark] I'm a pigeon
and I'm a nervous wreck.

03:45.893 --> 03:49.127
If this is the stuff
we got to go through
to make liquor, really.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.130
[daniel]
I'm seeing a black suv.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.234
[digger] oh, damn it.
Where's he going?

03:55.236 --> 03:56.201
I can't see.

03:56.203 --> 03:59.137
He's just, he's a creeping in,
yeah.

04:01.208 --> 04:03.375
-[mark] oh, hell.
-[digger] oh, hell.
Get to that side.

04:03.978 --> 04:05.177
Radio silence.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.580
Man,
he's looking around here
at us.

04:11.118 --> 04:13.418
Damn,
if that's the undercover,
they're had.

04:21.095 --> 04:22.194
[mark] he's backing up.

04:26.267 --> 04:27.399
[mark] he's getting out.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.236
He's going on,
he's going west.

04:31.238 --> 04:34.306
[daniel] it looks to me like
he's leaving right now.

04:34.308 --> 04:36.375
That don't do nothing
for my wet drawers
right now, though.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.410
<i> [digger] well, you know,</i>
<i>  the lucky thing about it,</i>

04:38.412 --> 04:40.779
while this guy was
cleaning his fingernails
in his car,

04:40.781 --> 04:42.648
whatever he's doing,
this tote filled up.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.349
We've got
all the water,
we can haul.

04:44.351 --> 04:45.951
Let's get
the hell out of here.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.253
Next thing is
we're heading out
bright early in the morning,

04:48.255 --> 04:51.890
north carolina, to make
a little liquor
out of this limestone water.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.692
[mark] what do you say
we skedaddle, old buddy?

04:53.694 --> 04:55.227
[daniel]
we'll get
the hell out of here.

05:05.339 --> 05:07.205
[mark] hey, you can't see
nothing from over here, huh?

05:07.207 --> 05:09.241
We get to running, though,
we might cut

05:09.243 --> 05:11.343
a piece of laurel
through this trail.

05:11.345 --> 05:13.445
<i> [narrator] in graham county,</i>
<i>  north carolina,</i>

05:13.447 --> 05:17.082
<i>  after spending last season</i>
<i>  helping those in need,</i>

05:17.084 --> 05:19.151
<i>  mark and huck</i>
<i>  kick off the year</i>

05:19.153 --> 05:22.187
<i>  by rebuilding capital</i>
<i>  with an old favorite.</i>

05:22.189 --> 05:23.755
Now people are getting
back to work,

05:23.757 --> 05:25.557
now things are getting
back to normal.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.694
<i>  People getting little money</i>
<i>  in their pocket.</i>

05:28.696 --> 05:31.396
<i>  Usually we just, you know,</i>
<i>  make corn liquor and brandy,</i>

05:31.398 --> 05:35.233
you know, but this year
we thought we'd make some
good fortified wine.

05:35.235 --> 05:36.735
<i>  Our old buddy, steve,</i>
<i>  said he had</i>

05:36.737 --> 05:39.671
<i>  about a hundred pounds of</i>
<i>  good quality grapes.</i>

05:39.673 --> 05:42.974
What we're going to do
with these grapes is
work it off into wine,

05:42.976 --> 05:46.645
use about half of it to
distill, make it into brandy.

05:47.247 --> 05:48.313
Getting water, huck?

05:48.315 --> 05:50.115
[huck] got plenty!

05:50.117 --> 05:53.218
[mark] then we're going to
take our brandy and pour it
back into our wine.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.287
That's what they call
a fortified wine.

05:55.289 --> 05:56.955
It's got a real good taste.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.391
Still good and stout.
Make a lot more product

05:59.393 --> 06:01.259
<i>  and a whole lot more of</i>
<i>  money, too.</i>

06:01.261 --> 06:04.029
So our old buddy, steve,
we're going to go
check him out

06:04.031 --> 06:05.397
<i>  and see what he's got.</i>

06:06.667 --> 06:10.168
[narrator]
<i>  fortified wine traces back</i>
<i>  to the roman empire,</i>

06:10.170 --> 06:15.340
<i>  but its use increased during</i>
<i>  europe's golden age of sail</i>
<i>  in the 1700s,</i>

06:15.342 --> 06:19.010
<i>  because the product's</i>
<i>  high proof saved</i>
<i>  on cargo space</i>

06:19.012 --> 06:23.148
<i>  and ensured it wouldn't spoil</i>
<i>  on long ocean voyages.</i>

06:23.150 --> 06:27.219
<i>  The heady mix of liquor</i>
<i>  and wine quickly gained</i>
<i>  widespread popularity</i>

06:27.221 --> 06:30.756
<i>  and became all the rage</i>
<i>  on the mainland.</i>

06:30.758 --> 06:35.761
<i>  Today, fortified wine</i>
<i>  is commonly consumed</i>
<i>  in the states as vermouth,</i>

06:35.763 --> 06:40.132
<i>  the staple and cocktails like</i>
<i> the martini and the manhattan.</i>

06:40.134 --> 06:43.068
<i>  It can also be drunk</i>
<i>  on its own as a sherry,</i>

06:43.070 --> 06:45.003
<i>  port or madeira wine.</i>

06:46.373 --> 06:47.406
Oh, look at that, boss.

06:47.408 --> 06:49.808
Damn pretty, ain't it?
Yes, spring time

06:49.810 --> 06:52.911
and grapes ain't in season
yet here,

06:52.913 --> 06:55.147
<i>  our old buddy, steve,</i>
<i>  he went into mexico</i>

06:55.149 --> 06:58.083
and he brings them back
to these fruit stands
and sells them.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.151
But he had some extra.

06:59.153 --> 07:01.019
We wound up getting them
from him.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.955
-What do you want for them?
-[steve] last year y'all
made that juice for me.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.957
If you want to put a jar
or something in there,

07:05.959 --> 07:08.293
when you got it back,
that'd be fine.
There ain't no hurry for it.

07:08.295 --> 07:10.128
Make a little fortified wine,
there.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.229
-[steve] yeah.
<i> -[mark] yeah, this might be</i>

07:11.231 --> 07:13.165
a pretty good thing
for me and huck.

07:13.167 --> 07:16.868
<i>  We'd be the first ones</i>
<i> to be able to make some liquor</i>
<i>  out of grapes this year.</i>

07:16.870 --> 07:18.470
-[mark] thank you, man.
-[steve] thank you, mark.

07:18.472 --> 07:20.038
-Thank you, huck.
-[huck] steve, appreciate it.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.339
Yes. Fortified wine.

07:21.341 --> 07:23.842
<i>  It's in between a good brandy</i>
<i>  and a wine, too,</i>

07:23.844 --> 07:26.611
<i>  so it should be some</i>
<i>  of the best liquor</i>
<i>  we ever made.</i>

07:40.627 --> 07:42.561
[richard] man, you see
the fish jumping
in this bayou?

07:42.563 --> 07:44.963
[craig] there's
a whole lot of things
in that bayou, fish,

07:44.965 --> 07:46.665
alligators, turtles.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.733
[richard] stop.
I ain't eaten lunch yet.
Let's go.

07:48.735 --> 07:51.036
<i> [narrator] in new iberia,</i>
<i>  louisiana,</i>

<i>  richard and his brother craig</i>
<i>  are returning</i>
<i>  to their still site,</i>

07:55.108 --> 07:59.678
<i>  as the rainy season turns</i>
<i>  to moonshine season</i>
<i>  on the bayou.</i>

07:59.680 --> 08:01.112
[richard]
<i>  everybody wants a good drink.</i>

08:01.114 --> 08:03.582
I've been having
people coming to me
left and right.

08:03.584 --> 08:06.818
Hey, can I get some?
Can I get some?
So this is the time right now

08:06.820 --> 08:09.321
<i>  that we're going to get</i>
<i>  out here and we're going</i>
<i>  to produce some liquor.</i>

08:09.323 --> 08:10.822
It's a lot of growth
over here.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.157
We ought to have
a lot of shade back here.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.392
It's been a couple of months
since we've been
at the old site,

08:14.394 --> 08:16.428
so we're gonna
go over there and see
what we got going on.

08:16.430 --> 08:18.096
Look at this mud, craig.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.898
-[richard] oh, my goodness.
-[craig] all right.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.299
-So, we're underwater.
-[richard] damn!

08:21.301 --> 08:23.268
Our spot from last year,

08:23.270 --> 08:25.904
<i>  it's currently sitting</i>
<i>  in a couple of inches</i>
<i>  of water.</i>

08:25.906 --> 08:27.539
I'm not going to deal
with this right here.

08:27.541 --> 08:30.208
It's a no go.
We're going to have to find
another spot.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.477
Let's see if there's
something else, man,
we could deal with.

08:33.680 --> 08:36.147
This area right here
is just a little bit
too wide open.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.249
Let's see what we can do
over here.

08:37.251 --> 08:38.984
Stay pretty close
to the bayou,

08:38.986 --> 08:41.152
because that's our main thing,
having this cold water.

08:41.154 --> 08:44.956
That's why we're here,
not to drink,
but for a condenser, it's a1.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.858
I like this little area
right here.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.327
It's hidden enough.
We got a little brush here.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.830
What we're going
to have to do is
build a deck or something

08:51.832 --> 08:53.632
to put everything on,
so we don't have
to go through this.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.901
Even if it's muddy,
we could come back here.

08:55.903 --> 08:58.837
This new spot,
it's a little higher than
the last part that we had.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.205
It's not muddy there.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.040
-[craig] twelve feet
by eight feet.
-[richard] perfect.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.208
There's enough room.

09:03.810 --> 09:04.843
What do you see?

09:04.845 --> 09:06.411
That is an alligator
right there, son.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.680
I told you,
I seen that big thing.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.348
[craig] if it come up here...

09:10.350 --> 09:12.284
We ain't got to worry
about what we're going
to eat

09:12.286 --> 09:14.152
for the rest of this week.
I can promise you that.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.120
That will be over.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.088
This is a perfect spot.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.424
<i>  The faster we can</i>
<i>  get this site set up,</i>

09:19.426 --> 09:21.726
man, the faster we can
get some cash rolling.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.361
[cell phone ringing]

09:23.363 --> 09:25.597
-what's up, james?
<i> -[james on phone] hey, man,</i>
<i>  what's going on, rich?</i>

09:25.599 --> 09:27.232
Nothing much, man.
What's happening?

09:27.267 --> 09:29.734
<i> [james on phone] oh, man,</i>
<i>  I'm down in new orleans, man,</i>
<i>  at a barbecue, man.</i>

09:29.736 --> 09:31.136
<i>  I had a little bit of</i>
<i>  that shine with me, man,</i>

09:31.138 --> 09:32.971
<i>  that moonshine the one</i>
<i>  that I got from you...</i>

09:32.973 --> 09:34.806
-[richard] uh-huh.
-[james on phone]
<i>  my people tasted it, bro.</i>

09:34.808 --> 09:36.107
Come on.
What do they think?

09:36.143 --> 09:37.976
<i> [james] oh, man,</i>
<i>  they loved it.</i>
<i>  And look, what else, man?</i>

09:37.978 --> 09:39.778
<i>  They're wondering</i>
<i>  if you can get some</i>
<i>  more for them,</i>

09:39.780 --> 09:40.979
<i>  you know, I told them,</i>
<i>  a little.</i>

09:40.981 --> 09:42.314
<i>  -They want the green one.</i>
<i> -Green?</i>

09:42.316 --> 09:44.282
<i> [james on phone] oh, yeah,</i>
<i>  green one, the absinthe, man.</i>

09:44.284 --> 09:45.784
Oh, absinthe.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.118
<i> [james] they said</i>
<i>  that's the good one, man.</i>

09:47.120 --> 09:48.386
From what I know
about absinthe,

09:48.388 --> 09:50.322
it has
a lot of ingredients in it.

09:50.324 --> 09:52.123
I've never made
anything like this before.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.892
Definitely got to do
some research on it.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.627
But I mean that stuff
is expensive, man.

09:55.629 --> 09:58.296
-[james on phone]
<i>  -you got that money, charged</i>
<i>  about 250 for a gallon.</i>

10:00.267 --> 10:02.400
-We can do it.
-[james on phone]
<i>  we could make that money.</i>

10:02.402 --> 10:04.803
All right. I appreciate it.
I'll take care of you
on the back end.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.204
[james on phone]
<i>  all right. Thank you.</i>

10:06.206 --> 10:07.339
All right, appreciate it,
my brother.

10:07.341 --> 10:09.307
250 a gallon, that's not bad.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.943
No. But,
what the hell is absinthe?
What's in it?

10:11.945 --> 10:14.379
I know what's in it. Money.

10:14.381 --> 10:18.683
<i> [narrator] absinthe,</i>
<i>  the legendary liquor</i>
<i>  known as the green fairy,</i>

10:18.685 --> 10:22.520
<i>  has been shrouded</i>
<i>  in mystery and myth</i>
<i>  since it was first invented</i>

10:22.522 --> 10:25.890
<i>  by a french doctor</i>
<i>  in the 1700s.</i>

10:25.892 --> 10:30.395
<i> A potent mix of grain, spirit,</i>
<i>  and over 12 herbs</i>
<i>  and botanicals</i>

10:30.397 --> 10:32.864
<i>  give absinthe</i>
<i>  its licorice like flavor</i>

10:32.866 --> 10:35.634
<i>  and evocative green hue.</i>

10:35.636 --> 10:39.270
<i>  Absinthe was outlawed</i>
<i>  in 1912 in the united states</i>

10:39.272 --> 10:43.041
<i>  when rumors spread that</i>
<i>  wormwood, the same ingredient</i>

10:43.043 --> 10:46.211
<i>  that's said to give absinthe</i>
<i>  its psychedelic properties,</i>

10:46.213 --> 10:48.179
<i>  caused madness.</i>

10:48.181 --> 10:53.218
<i>  It was later discovered that</i>
<i>  no scientific evidence</i>
<i>  supported the claim.</i>

10:53.220 --> 10:58.089
<i>  However, it wasn't until,</i>
<i>  nearly a century,</i>
<i>  later in 2007</i>

10:58.091 --> 11:00.659
<i>  that the ban</i>
<i>  was finally lifted</i>

11:00.661 --> 11:05.196
<i>  and americans could</i>
<i>  legally dance with</i>
<i>  the green fairy once again.</i>

11:05.932 --> 11:07.699
Ain't nobody making
no absinthe.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.634
New orleans is all about
drinking.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.202
This is a new client
and a new city.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.672
I mean,
this is the type of customers
we're looking for.

11:13.674 --> 11:16.775
If this works,
this can open up
a whole big market for us.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.309
We got to set up
this still site.

11:18.311 --> 11:20.445
I'm gonna leave this here.
We're going to let
this alligator know

11:20.447 --> 11:21.746
we're here now.

11:21.748 --> 11:23.248
But our reputation
is at stake.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.450
What if we turn in a product
that's not really good?

11:25.452 --> 11:28.119
It's a high-end customer
in new orleans
we're dealing with.

11:28.121 --> 11:29.387
I want to give him our best.

11:32.759 --> 11:34.426
We should've got
a softer brush.

11:34.428 --> 11:36.294
[huck] make sure you get
around your toenails.

11:36.296 --> 11:37.228
You'll have to help me up.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.430
-[laughs]
<i> -[mark] yeah, me and huck</i>

11:38.432 --> 11:40.165
just stomping them grapes,
you know,

11:40.167 --> 11:41.533
<i>  like they done</i>
<i>  back in the old days.</i>

11:41.535 --> 11:43.001
[huck] oh, you're doing good.
I hear them pop.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.402
[mark] talk about slick!

11:48.742 --> 11:52.944
[mark] never, ever had
to haul water to a still site
to mash in with.

11:52.946 --> 11:56.314
We're gonna have to do
something different.
We can't live like this.

11:56.316 --> 11:59.184
<i> [digger] well, you know,</i>
<i>  it's either stupidity</i>
<i>  or commitment.</i>

11:59.186 --> 12:03.088
We've hauled 275 gallons
of water 60 miles across

12:03.090 --> 12:04.155
<i>  the mountains</i>
<i>  of north carolina.</i>

12:04.157 --> 12:06.991
This is probably more effort

12:06.993 --> 12:10.929
and more work
than we've ever put into
a run of liquor in our lives.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.664
[mark] I'll get us
some water going.

12:12.666 --> 12:14.432
<i>  To make mark and digger's</i>
<i>  tennessee whiskey,</i>

12:14.434 --> 12:16.334
it's got to be
limestone water.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.203
<i>  We got to rig up the pump,</i>

12:18.839 --> 12:20.438
<i>  pump the water up the hill.</i>

12:20.440 --> 12:22.674
If we didn't have to have
this water,

12:22.676 --> 12:25.443
I certainly would not be
doing this.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.746
We've got to drag
hoses up that bank,

12:27.748 --> 12:30.482
all the way up
this hill to the still side.

12:30.484 --> 12:32.984
Then we've got to fire
a generator up.

12:32.986 --> 12:36.287
It's a damn sight amount
of work to make a run
of moonshine liquor,

12:36.289 --> 12:37.756
I'm telling you.

12:37.758 --> 12:40.191
-Hey, it's getting there.
-[daniel] oh.

12:40.193 --> 12:43.027
[digger] oh, hey,
cramp that hose now.
Don't waste it.

12:43.029 --> 12:44.329
We ain't got, but one tote.

12:44.331 --> 12:47.365
You know, we don't have
an endless supply of water
right now,

12:47.367 --> 12:50.168
so we've got to be careful
not to waste any of it.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.836
[daniel]
that's tennessee holy water.

12:51.838 --> 12:54.272
Yeah, boy.
We're at hallowed ground,
I guess

12:54.274 --> 12:57.041
you'd say. This
is popcorn's old still site.

12:57.043 --> 12:59.244
-Come on, daniel.
-[mark] this is a nice place,

12:59.246 --> 13:01.012
but it ain't
the handiest one,
is it?

13:01.014 --> 13:03.715
-[daniel] nope.
<i> -[digger] so, you know, as far</i>
<i>  as what we're doing today,</i>

13:03.717 --> 13:04.949
<i>  it's worth it.</i>

13:04.951 --> 13:08.019
But as far as making a career,
making liquor up here,

13:08.021 --> 13:09.020
ain't going to happen.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.188
Too much work.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.923
-All right. Get her.
-Let's get her hot.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.358
Give us a little gas.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.661
[mark] whoa! I think I like
your old lady, digger,

13:16.663 --> 13:18.763
-just putting that
all over town.
-Putting that all over town.

13:18.765 --> 13:19.998
[both laugh]

13:20.000 --> 13:21.399
<i> [digger] you know,</i>
<i>  beyond this water,</i>

13:21.401 --> 13:23.434
<i>  we've got to have</i>
<i>  our white corn,</i>

13:23.436 --> 13:25.870
<i>  our malted barley and a rye.</i>

13:25.872 --> 13:28.173
The way we measure up here,
'cause we're not going
to bring scales,

13:28.175 --> 13:31.109
we just mark the graduations
on our bucket

13:31.111 --> 13:33.845
<i>  and we know where</i>
<i>  the weights are at</i>
<i>  for which particular grain.</i>

13:33.847 --> 13:35.413
There's the rye.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.715
<i> [mark] as good a guy</i>
<i>  as daniel is and all the help</i>
<i>  he's given us</i>

13:37.717 --> 13:39.284
looking out for us, you know,

13:39.286 --> 13:43.688
we feel it's just fair
to bring him in as a partner
on this tennessee whiskey.

13:43.690 --> 13:47.091
Right. This old stir stick.
I got here made out
of black walnut.

13:47.093 --> 13:49.194
It's got
tennessee shaped holes
cut in it.

13:49.196 --> 13:50.395
[daniel] yeah.

13:50.397 --> 13:53.631
So will that have any bearing
on tennessee whiskey,

13:53.633 --> 13:55.233
if we make it
north carolina?

13:55.235 --> 13:57.702
That'll help make
tennessee whiskey,
I bet a dollar on it.

13:57.704 --> 13:59.070
[both laugh]

13:59.072 --> 14:00.672
it'll make it
a hell of a lot better mash

14:00.674 --> 14:01.706
if it's from tennessee.

14:01.708 --> 14:03.341
Yeah, you'd have to think.

14:03.343 --> 14:06.044
I mean, the mash may not know,
but me and you
and digger know.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.278
That's right.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.314
Well, you always say,
it ain't a lie
if you believe it.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.983
No, no. It ain't a lie
if you don't believe it.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.218
[digger] oh, yeah, that.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.752
<i> [daniel] you know,</i>
<i>  today they're actually</i>

14:14.754 --> 14:17.322
teaching me
the exact measurements

14:17.324 --> 14:20.191
that they put into
a 55-gallon drum of mash.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.360
[digger] we've got to stir
the hell out of it.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.929
And I am completely
honored that...

14:24.931 --> 14:27.966
That mark and digger
would trust me
with... With the recipe.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.001
Digger, do you think
popcorn would be proud of us?

14:30.003 --> 14:32.036
No, he'd have thought...
Well, he'd be
saying right now,

14:32.038 --> 14:34.806
"I don't know
what the hell you boys think
you're accomplishing."

14:34.808 --> 14:38.643
<i> [mark] oh, if popcorn know</i>
<i>  that we was hauling water</i>
<i>  to make mash and stuff,</i>

14:38.645 --> 14:42.881
he'd call us everything
in the book and tell us
how damn stupid we was.

14:42.883 --> 14:45.917
And, you know, I'm not so sure
that he wouldn't be right.

14:45.919 --> 14:48.453
He made some good liquor
and he made terrible liquor,

14:48.455 --> 14:51.022
but now he used
whatever he had.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.390
-Oh, yeah.
-And that's what--

14:52.392 --> 14:54.225
[digger] that's what I say
all the time, you know,

14:54.227 --> 14:56.794
they holler
the popcorn recipe,
popcorn recipe.

14:56.796 --> 14:59.163
Which one?
Hell, there's nine millions.

14:59.165 --> 15:01.165
He never did anything
the same.

15:01.167 --> 15:02.634
<i>  Well, we got the mash made.</i>

15:02.636 --> 15:03.668
<i>  We just need to bring it down</i>

15:03.670 --> 15:06.004
<i>  to temperature,</i>
<i>  where the yeast will thrive.</i>

15:06.006 --> 15:08.306
Then we're ready to let
it ferment, then we'll
come back here and run it.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.575
What do you think
we cover these things up?

15:10.577 --> 15:13.378
[digger] yep,
let mother nature
do its thing.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.521
[birds chirping]

15:27.227 --> 15:29.827
[richard] we're ready to go.
We're gonna get this set up
and put a still on it

15:29.829 --> 15:31.095
and start running.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.031
The faster we can get
this site set up, man,

15:33.033 --> 15:35.166
<i>  the faster we can get</i>
<i>  some cash rolling.</i>

15:35.168 --> 15:38.069
[craig] I'm wondering
if that alligator is coming
back around here.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.938
We're about to see
if it came up.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.707
All right.
Let's get to work, man.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.177
Put one on the bottom.

15:46.179 --> 15:50.114
The quicker we do this,
the quicker we can start
mashing this in.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.550
<i>  It doesn't have to be</i>
<i>  the most beautiful thing</i>
<i>  in the world,</i>

15:52.552 --> 15:54.352
but it does have to be
functional.

15:55.855 --> 15:56.988
This is it.

15:58.892 --> 16:00.091
All right, we're done.

16:00.093 --> 16:02.660
They didn't build
rome in a day
because I wasn't there.

16:02.662 --> 16:05.063
Come on, let's get some stuff
and mash in
before it gets too late.

16:05.065 --> 16:07.065
Now that our deck is build,

16:07.067 --> 16:08.399
<i>  we're going to do</i>
<i>  our sugar wash,</i>

16:08.401 --> 16:12.904
the high proof neutral spirit
for our absinthe.

16:12.906 --> 16:14.238
<i>  I've done</i>
<i>  a lot of research on it.</i>

16:14.240 --> 16:16.140
The first thing we have to do
with absinthe

16:16.142 --> 16:18.309
is run a base spirit,
a neutral spirit,

16:18.311 --> 16:20.712
something that
doesn't taste like anything.

16:20.714 --> 16:23.014
Sugar and water,
most neutral you can get.

16:23.016 --> 16:25.383
The only flavors that
we're gonna
introduce into this

16:25.385 --> 16:28.619
is the things that we
bring into it
with the fennel, the wormwood.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.088
Oh, all the botanicals.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.923
-[richard] the botanicals.
-That's where
the flavor comes in

16:31.925 --> 16:33.358
on the back end.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.994
All that stuff combined
is going to give it
this vibrant green color.

16:35.996 --> 16:38.896
And when you lose it,
when you introduce
the water to it,

16:38.898 --> 16:43.301
it turns this whitish color
and you could see it
kind of darting around,

16:43.303 --> 16:46.371
that's when the oils
separate themselves
and they start to develop

16:46.373 --> 16:48.006
their aroma and flavor.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.841
This is some
mad science [bleep].

16:49.843 --> 16:52.310
It's the kind of science
that will make you mad.

16:52.312 --> 16:53.945
All right. We're at
a high enough temperature,

16:53.947 --> 16:55.346
let's start dropping
some sugar in here.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.081
-[craig] all right.
<i> -[richard] in absinthe,</i>

16:57.083 --> 16:58.449
there are so many
complex flavors.

16:58.451 --> 17:01.652
So going in with
a base neutral spirit
makes so much sense.

17:01.654 --> 17:04.122
It's a hard process,
it's a hard product,

17:04.124 --> 17:07.425
but there's never been
a liquor that we touched
that we couldn't conquer.

17:11.998 --> 17:13.898
Grab the yeast. Let's go.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.434
It's a real good yeast,
real good yeast nutrients.

17:16.436 --> 17:17.702
[richard] that's good.

17:17.704 --> 17:18.936
[richard]
<i>  we'll let that work off.</i>

17:18.938 --> 17:21.305
<i>  Hopefully a couple of days,</i>
<i>  that'll be done.</i>

17:21.307 --> 17:23.274
We'll go ahead
and start sourcing
all our botanicals.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.509
You got everything
out of here?

17:24.511 --> 17:26.310
-That's it.
-[craig] I'm going
to drink a beer.

17:26.312 --> 17:27.345
[richard] it's beer 30.

17:27.347 --> 17:30.448
It's five o'clock, somewhere.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.896
[huck] oh, god, that's kind of
like being a pallbearer,
ain't it?

17:44.898 --> 17:47.565
-[mark] it is.
-[huck] let's let it down
for a minute.

17:50.336 --> 17:52.437
Yeah, we're going to
work our grapes
over good,

17:52.439 --> 17:55.239
get all the stems out of it,
make sure some of them,

17:55.241 --> 17:56.908
you know,
ain't molded or nothing,

17:56.910 --> 18:00.011
make a little fortified wine
and get a lot of money
out of it.

18:01.014 --> 18:02.780
We got
a lot of grapes to mash.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.449
[huck] if we have
to mash these up
with our hands,

18:04.451 --> 18:08.019
like we did once before,
we'd probably end up
with that carpal tunnel.

18:08.021 --> 18:10.521
Yeah, that's too mean to
mash up by hand.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.223
We ain't got no press.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.392
[huck] well, we'll stomp it in
with our feet.

18:14.394 --> 18:17.295
You clip your toenails
last night, mark?

18:17.297 --> 18:19.897
Yeah, back in the old days.
I guess they didn't have press

18:19.899 --> 18:23.401
and all that stuff
to mash the juice
out of the wine.

18:23.403 --> 18:26.070
<i>  I guess they just did</i>
<i>  foot treading, you know.</i>

18:26.072 --> 18:28.306
We might try that.
We got a lot of grapes
to mash.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.341
[huck] do you like that
brush I got you?

18:30.343 --> 18:32.076
What is it?
Is that a commode brush
or what is it?

18:32.078 --> 18:34.412
[huck] yeah. It'll work,
won't it?

18:34.414 --> 18:36.481
It ain't been used,
I got that at
the dollar store.

18:37.484 --> 18:38.983
Brand new.

18:38.985 --> 18:40.485
You're brushing your teeth.

18:40.487 --> 18:42.420
Make sure you get
around your toenails.
Feels good.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.655
[both laugh]

18:44.657 --> 18:46.991
me and huck knows what
our feet's been through.

18:46.993 --> 18:51.529
So I don't think I could drink
that liquor if I didn't clean
my feet good.

18:51.531 --> 18:54.365
Well, you should have got
a softer brush.
Well, that's burning.

18:54.367 --> 18:56.434
I mean, it's cleaning.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.402
Wash the bottom of my feet,
I done got that dirty.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.039
Oh, that's cold.

19:02.041 --> 19:03.241
Clean the toes.

19:05.044 --> 19:07.011
Now look how red
my leg is turning.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.146
[huck] that's good for you.

19:08.148 --> 19:09.313
[mark] like sandpaper.

19:10.049 --> 19:11.215
I got them cleaned, huck.

19:11.217 --> 19:12.316
Yeah, they're clean.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.518
You'll have to help me up.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.854
Talk about slick!

19:16.856 --> 19:19.423
Ah, bigfoot moonshine.

19:23.296 --> 19:24.428
You'll have to help me up.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.531
[huck laughs]

19:27.033 --> 19:28.666
talk about slick!

19:28.668 --> 19:31.302
Yeah, me and huck,
just stomping them grapes,
you know,

19:31.304 --> 19:32.703
just like they done back
in old days.

19:32.705 --> 19:33.838
Ah!

19:33.840 --> 19:35.673
[huck] oh, you're doing good.
I hear them popping.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.108
-[mark] yeah, they're busting.
-[huck] yeah.

19:37.110 --> 19:38.876
Bigfoot moonshine.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.978
Feels like a bucket full
of snails or something.

19:40.980 --> 19:43.314
-Bucket full of snails.
-[laughter]

19:43.316 --> 19:46.083
we always have a little fun
out of everything we do.

19:46.085 --> 19:48.352
[huck]
you're about the best
at that I've ever seen.

19:48.354 --> 19:51.789
If I had a drink or two
I could do this
a little faster.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.224
-[huck] they say
it's good for your feet.
-Oh, is it?

19:53.226 --> 19:55.626
-[huck] yeah.
-They need 'em.

19:55.628 --> 19:58.129
[huck] knowing him,
he'd probably make
a brandy out of it.

19:58.131 --> 20:01.265
Back in old days,
they just got
some pretty women, you know,

20:01.267 --> 20:03.000
and mashed them up
with their feet.

20:03.002 --> 20:05.436
<i>  Their feet are softer</i>
<i>  and they're lighter,</i>

20:05.438 --> 20:08.306
wouldn't mash the seeds,
you know, and all that stuff.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.341
-That's slick.
-It's slick.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.143
<i> [mark] we ain't got</i>
<i>  no women around here,</i>

20:12.145 --> 20:13.844
<i>  so I guess it's me or huck,</i>

20:13.846 --> 20:15.880
so who do you think
is going to do it?

20:15.882 --> 20:17.481
Get some dirty hands
all over my--

20:17.483 --> 20:18.983
[huck] I've done washed
my hands.

20:19.018 --> 20:20.918
[laughter]

20:20.920 --> 20:24.422
yeah. Crushing them seeds
would make that wine
real bitter.

20:24.424 --> 20:28.359
I'll just step real easy
and try to bust them
real gentle, like you know.

20:28.361 --> 20:29.927
Mashed it pretty good,
though, ain't it?

20:29.929 --> 20:30.928
[huck] yeah, they are.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.164
Let's get that mash barrel
cleaned up.

20:33.166 --> 20:35.099
Start laying the sugar
and yeast to it
and everything,

20:35.101 --> 20:36.801
and get her to working.

20:36.803 --> 20:39.203
Yeah, fortified wine
is just making a good wine

20:39.205 --> 20:41.839
and making it
as strong as you can.

20:41.841 --> 20:45.876
These grapes, just we'll use
about half of it,
we'll work it off as wine

20:45.878 --> 20:50.281
and then probably
use about half of it to
distill into brandy.

20:50.283 --> 20:53.317
This wine, you know,
it might come out
10%, 12%.

20:53.319 --> 20:58.522
And then when we pour
our brandy back into it,
maybe get it up to 20%.

20:58.524 --> 21:00.791
<i>  We just want it stouter</i>
<i>  than most wines,</i>

21:00.793 --> 21:02.627
<i>  maybe charge</i>
<i>  a little more for it.</i>

21:02.629 --> 21:04.862
Me and huck,
we've got to make us money
this year.

21:04.864 --> 21:07.331
Oh, only thing we need to do
now is cap her off.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.133
[mark]
<i>  we're gonna let it work</i>
<i>  all the way off.</i>

21:09.135 --> 21:11.135
Run it whenever
we think it's about right.

21:11.137 --> 21:12.703
It should have a good flavor.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.538
<i>  Still want it to have</i>
<i>  the moonshine kick,</i>

21:14.540 --> 21:16.274
<i>  but to have</i>
<i>  a real good wine taste.</i>

21:16.276 --> 21:19.210
[huck] that's good, mark.
Good shape.

21:32.325 --> 21:34.191
-[richard] check this
wash out, man.
-[craig] yeah.

21:34.193 --> 21:36.594
-[richard] I'm nervous
about this stuff.
-Check this out.

21:37.730 --> 21:40.831
Oh, man. That's crazy.
Look at that.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.300
[richard]
<i>  man, I done kept this</i>
<i>  mash barrel,</i>

21:42.302 --> 21:44.635
and this thing is rolling
like a pot of gumbo.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.071
-This is a good yeast.
-[craig] this is so crazy.

21:47.073 --> 21:50.141
<i> [richard] it doesn't</i>
<i>  smell like anything,</i>
<i>  but alcohol.</i>

21:50.143 --> 21:53.177
If this is any indication
of how our final product
is going to be,

21:53.179 --> 21:55.246
we're gonna have
a kickass absinthe.

21:55.248 --> 21:58.349
Hell, yeah. It smells like
it's ready to drink now.

21:58.351 --> 22:00.518
[richard] yeah,
but it needs to go
a couple more days.

22:02.021 --> 22:04.955
Come on,
we're going to leave it alone,
come back.

22:06.092 --> 22:07.692
Hopefully
it'll be ready to drink.

22:07.694 --> 22:08.793
[richard]
<i>  we'll let that work off.</i>

22:08.795 --> 22:10.127
<i>  It gives us a little time</i>
<i>  to sit down</i>

22:10.129 --> 22:12.330
and look at some
of these botanicals
and try to figure out

22:12.332 --> 22:13.564
what we're gonna
put in our absinthe.

22:13.566 --> 22:16.133
[richard] and I got
all the little botanicals
that we need.

22:16.135 --> 22:19.337
Absinthe has
a lot of different
characters and flavors.

22:19.339 --> 22:23.240
There's fennel and wormwood.
There's anise seed.

22:23.242 --> 22:25.910
<i>  From my research,</i>
<i>  the most important</i>
<i>  ingredients in absinthe</i>

22:25.912 --> 22:27.978
are fennel,
wormwood and anise.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.680
<i>  Fennel and anise,</i>
<i>  this is where</i>

22:29.682 --> 22:31.515
we get the licorice flavor
in the absinthe.

22:31.517 --> 22:35.419
It helps counter
the bitter taste
in the wormwood.

22:35.421 --> 22:36.921
[richard] lemon balm.

22:36.923 --> 22:37.855
[craig] lemon balm.

22:37.857 --> 22:40.391
Lemon balm,
it adds a citrus flavor.

22:40.393 --> 22:42.126
It smells like
what it sounds like.

22:42.128 --> 22:44.261
Some spearmint and hyssop.

22:45.431 --> 22:49.033
Hyssop
is something different,
it's in the mint family, too.

22:49.035 --> 22:51.235
<i>  Hyssop,</i>
<i>  it's an old, old, old herb,</i>

22:51.237 --> 22:54.672
and this is going to give
a little softness
to our complexity.

22:54.674 --> 22:55.740
Come on, I want to try
some of this.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.308
[craig]
all right. Let's try it.

22:57.377 --> 23:00.378
<i> [richard] you know,</i>
<i> some of these herbs I've never</i>
<i>  really even heard of,</i>

23:00.380 --> 23:03.180
<i>  just tasting them</i>
<i>  is taking your taste buds</i>

23:03.182 --> 23:05.249
<i>  somewhere</i>
<i>  it's never been before.</i>

23:05.251 --> 23:06.817
I'm gonna bite
this whole star anise.

23:06.819 --> 23:08.285
[richard]
true licorice tasting plant.

23:08.287 --> 23:11.222
It tastes just like licorice,
man, very overpowering.

23:11.224 --> 23:13.424
This is anise seed right here.

23:16.429 --> 23:20.931
This little bit of seed
right here has way,
way, way more flavor

23:20.933 --> 23:24.235
than this bigger seed
in this thing right here.

23:24.237 --> 23:26.504
Wormwood,
major ingredient right here.

23:27.707 --> 23:30.007
What is this
going to taste like?

23:30.009 --> 23:33.577
It actually smells good,
so I take a little pinch
to taste.

23:34.180 --> 23:35.546
And man...

23:36.949 --> 23:39.216
-Oh, my...
-That's wormwood.

23:39.218 --> 23:41.886
[craig] tastes like a worm.
Oh, my god, don't taste that.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.087
Whoo.

23:43.089 --> 23:45.022
Okay, now you see that
right there,
ain't good for you.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.124
Wormwood
definitely surprises you.

23:47.126 --> 23:50.227
This is complex
that's why you taste
so much in this drink.

23:50.229 --> 23:51.762
We've researched
a lot of recipes.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.931
We've researched
a lot of history
with absinthe.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.966
<i>  So we're gonna take</i>
<i>  all of those recipes</i>

23:55.968 --> 23:58.369
and kind of take
a little bit of this,
a little bit of that,

23:58.371 --> 23:59.970
kind of muddle some...
Some of the stuff.

23:59.972 --> 24:01.338
<i>  We're gonna give it</i>
<i>  a little early start.</i>

24:01.340 --> 24:02.940
We're gonna put
all that together

24:02.942 --> 24:05.109
and come up
with our own absinthe recipe.

24:05.111 --> 24:08.279
Trying to get that,
that smell
and that taste consistency

24:08.281 --> 24:10.181
right, kind of
in a powder form.

24:10.183 --> 24:12.450
All the time and the effort
that we're investing in this,

24:12.452 --> 24:14.952
I mean, it's a lot of time
it takes to do this drink.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.921
This is a real
complicated process.

24:16.923 --> 24:19.924
<i>  If this doesn't work,</i>
<i>  not only</i>
<i>  we will be losing a customer,</i>

24:19.926 --> 24:21.258
but we'll be losing
a lot of time

24:21.260 --> 24:23.260
and that's something
that you can't get back.

24:23.262 --> 24:24.328
Let's see what we got.

24:27.266 --> 24:30.968
Man!
It smells good, man.
This is different.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.803
I don't know
if I want to wear it,
drink it,

24:32.805 --> 24:34.371
eat it, something.

24:34.373 --> 24:35.906
The stakes
are real high with this,

24:35.908 --> 24:37.374
but I think
we're really
going to nail this.

24:37.376 --> 24:38.976
We're going to leave
it right here.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.978
-[craig] time to make
that money, man.
-That's it.

24:46.252 --> 24:48.285
[siren wailing]

24:54.227 --> 24:56.160
[digger]
<i>  today is the day, girls.</i>

24:56.162 --> 24:58.963
<i>  Today is the day</i>
<i>  we run tennessee whiskey</i>

24:58.965 --> 25:00.965
in the great state
of north carolina.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.300
Let's see what we got here.

25:03.302 --> 25:07.004
Oh, yeah, caps failed
and it's very little
left on top.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.573
<i> [mark] the mash is dead</i>
<i>  as last year's calendars.</i>

25:09.575 --> 25:12.877
<i>  We've done everything</i>
<i>  exactly as we did</i>
<i>  in tennessee,</i>

25:12.879 --> 25:17.181
but you never know
what you're gonna get
till you put it in the still.

25:17.183 --> 25:20.584
Three tennessee moonshiners
in the tar heel state.

25:20.586 --> 25:22.920
There you go, dan,
there's the lighting device.

25:22.922 --> 25:24.221
All right.

25:27.927 --> 25:29.260
How about like that
right up there, buddy?

25:29.262 --> 25:31.395
That looks good to me.

25:31.397 --> 25:33.998
[daniel] you know,
this is the sacred spot
right here

25:34.000 --> 25:38.302
that me as a moonshiner,
I'll take to my grave.

25:38.304 --> 25:40.671
[mark] with that being said,
my thing is,

25:41.674 --> 25:45.576
this is a damn extremely
out-of-the-way place.

25:45.578 --> 25:46.944
[digger] yeah.

25:46.946 --> 25:53.384
And I ain't never in my life
hauled mash and water
to a still site.

25:53.386 --> 25:56.420
It's an honor to run
at popcorn sutton's
old still site,

25:56.422 --> 25:58.422
but it's completely
inefficient

25:58.424 --> 26:01.091
hauling water 100 miles
each and every time

26:01.093 --> 26:03.193
we want to do a run
of tennessee whiskey.

26:03.195 --> 26:04.995
I think it's just crazy.

26:04.997 --> 26:06.397
[digger]
<i>  figure our time into it</i>

26:06.399 --> 26:09.333
and the time
we've got driving all the time
trying to get over here

26:09.335 --> 26:11.001
and make a run
of tennessee whiskey,

26:11.003 --> 26:13.370
plus our fuel
for two and three vehicles,

26:13.372 --> 26:14.738
<i>  it's cutting</i>
<i>  in on the profits.</i>

26:14.740 --> 26:18.108
So we... No, this is,
this is insane.

26:18.110 --> 26:22.913
We need a still site
in the same location
as the limestone water source.

26:22.915 --> 26:26.116
If we stay here,
it's going to kill our season.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.525
[huck] want to smell it, mark?

26:34.527 --> 26:35.993
Let's see if it's ready.

26:36.662 --> 26:37.995
Mmm-hmm.

26:38.497 --> 26:39.964
[exhales sharply]

26:39.966 --> 26:41.365
got the alcohol in it.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.467
Well, it does, don't it?

26:43.469 --> 26:46.971
[mark] when making
fortified wine,
what we're gonna do is

26:46.973 --> 26:50.074
<i>  we're gonna save</i>
<i>  half of the barrel</i>
<i>  of the wine for later.</i>

26:50.076 --> 26:52.309
And then we're gonna run
half of it

26:52.311 --> 26:54.778
<i>  into some good</i>
<i>  high proof brandy to</i>

26:54.780 --> 26:56.313
mix back into our wine.

26:56.315 --> 26:58.582
Well, that's pretty
right there.

26:58.584 --> 27:01.352
<i>  People this year,</i>
<i>  they want some good stuff</i>
<i>  to drink</i>

27:01.354 --> 27:04.955
and this... It ought to be
about as good a tasting liquor
as we ever made.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.357
Huck, probably
that's about enough,

27:06.359 --> 27:08.025
or that's about
half of it, ain't it?

27:08.027 --> 27:09.159
-Got it, don't you?
-[mark] yeah.

27:11.063 --> 27:13.864
<i> [mark] the best wood</i>
<i>  in these mountains is locust.</i>

27:13.866 --> 27:15.432
We got some locust
right here.

27:15.434 --> 27:17.267
Now this is fixing
to get hot.

27:17.269 --> 27:19.870
It's less smoke,
more heat.

27:19.872 --> 27:22.239
<i>  It's really</i>
<i>  the best wood you can burn.</i>

27:22.241 --> 27:24.174
Well, let's see
if we can cap 'er off.

27:24.944 --> 27:26.877
Yeah, it feels so good.

27:26.879 --> 27:29.013
Cap'll make it
run off all day.

27:29.915 --> 27:33.350
I've used rye, meal, oatmeal.

27:33.352 --> 27:35.653
I learned
a few years back
this plumbers putty

27:35.655 --> 27:37.354
is getting soft
and it seals good.

27:37.356 --> 27:39.823
You reuse it,
but every dime you can save,

27:39.825 --> 27:42.393
that's just more
that's going to help you
get through the winter.

27:42.395 --> 27:45.763
<i>  We're going to turn</i>
<i>  this 25-gallon of wine</i>
<i>  into brandy.</i>

27:45.765 --> 27:48.966
We should get at least
five-gallon out of it.

27:48.968 --> 27:52.269
<i>  When we mix it all up,</i>
<i>  we should wind up</i>
<i>  around 30 gallons</i>

27:52.271 --> 27:54.071
<i>  of good fortified wine.</i>

27:54.073 --> 27:55.673
That's a pretty good bit
of liquor.

27:55.675 --> 27:57.408
We should make
some good money
off of it.

27:57.410 --> 27:59.410
[mark] yup, she's running.

27:59.412 --> 28:02.246
[huck] yeah, I see that,
it's starting to drip
pretty good now, isn't it?

28:02.248 --> 28:04.148
We got our stream about right.

28:04.150 --> 28:05.516
We'll throw them heads off.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.989
Well, it's stout.

28:13.325 --> 28:15.392
Make your eyes water
right there.

28:15.394 --> 28:16.960
Oh, it is, ain't it?

28:16.962 --> 28:19.430
-Are you ready
to make some mixing?
-Yep.

28:19.432 --> 28:22.900
What we're wanting to do
is put the alcohol
to the wine,

28:22.902 --> 28:26.203
maybe get it at 20%
or even better
if we can.

28:26.205 --> 28:28.672
-Them big beads.
-Mmm-hmm.

28:28.674 --> 28:31.275
Make a good
high proof fortified wine.

28:33.679 --> 28:35.112
That's a pretty color,
ain't it?

28:35.147 --> 28:37.381
-That's color of a pink
grapefruit, ain't it?
-[mark] yeah.

28:45.991 --> 28:48.559
But this might be
just a little bit low
on the proof though,

28:48.561 --> 28:50.294
just a little bit.

28:50.296 --> 28:54.898
Checking it, and tasting of it
and noticed
it's a little bit too sweet.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.100
[huck] it's a little bit low,
ain't it?

28:56.102 --> 28:57.468
[mark] just a little bit.

28:57.470 --> 28:59.837
<i>  The beads were small</i>
<i>  and going away quick.</i>

28:59.839 --> 29:01.071
We know it is low proof,

29:01.073 --> 29:04.141
so we need to put
some more good,
high proof brandy in it.

29:04.143 --> 29:06.009
So I reckon a gallon
makes her about right.

29:06.011 --> 29:07.377
[huck] let's try.

29:07.379 --> 29:10.314
Mixing the brandy in,
we got to go real slow.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.150
<i>  We don't want to change</i>
<i>  the taste of it much.</i>

29:13.152 --> 29:16.220
We want to have it
to get grape taste
and a good high proof.

29:19.225 --> 29:22.993
Hmm. Watch... Smell this.
Smell that.
Just try it, mate.

29:22.995 --> 29:24.628
-Well, it smells good,
don't it?
-Just try it.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.366
How did that taste?

29:29.368 --> 29:32.169
Hmm. Probably wouldn't hurt
to put a tad more of that in.

29:32.171 --> 29:34.104
[mark] I'm glad we saved this.

29:34.106 --> 29:36.073
Yeah, we're down to our
last gallon.

29:36.075 --> 29:37.741
It's ain't burn off,
I'll tell you that.

29:37.743 --> 29:39.543
[huck] no, it ain't...
It ain't much.

29:39.545 --> 29:43.280
If we can't get this
mixed up right,
we're out of grapes.

29:43.282 --> 29:46.150
<i>  We can't send steve</i>
<i>  back to mexico</i>
<i>  to get more grapes,</i>

29:46.152 --> 29:48.685
so we may be up
a creek without a paddle.

29:50.089 --> 29:52.022
Try it again, huck.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.430
You wouldn't believe
how good that is.

30:00.432 --> 30:01.431
That's perfect.

30:01.433 --> 30:03.100
Oh, my goodness.

30:03.102 --> 30:05.202
You get that good grape taste.

30:05.204 --> 30:06.904
That's about right,
right there.

30:06.906 --> 30:09.740
That's right, mate.
The wine part of it
cools it down, doesn't it?

30:09.742 --> 30:11.975
I believe
we need to leave it alone.

30:11.977 --> 30:15.179
Yeah. I'd say
it's about the smoothest
and the stoutest wine

30:15.181 --> 30:16.613
that we've ever tasted.

30:16.615 --> 30:19.416
But I guarantee you,
you take about
three drinks of that,

30:19.418 --> 30:21.185
that there good drinks,

30:21.187 --> 30:22.452
you'll be ready to dance.

30:22.788 --> 30:24.154
Got a little bite to it,

30:24.290 --> 30:28.959
you know, the brandy has,
but it's a smooth bite.
Fortified wine,

30:28.961 --> 30:30.027
we won't have trouble
selling that.

30:30.029 --> 30:32.062
-That's pretty, ain't it?
-[huck] mmm-hmm.

30:32.064 --> 30:34.798
The only problem we got,
me and huck
will have to stay out of it.

30:34.800 --> 30:37.034
We don't want to drink
our profit up.

30:51.417 --> 30:54.852
I tell you what,
it's really an honor
to get to make liquor here.

30:54.854 --> 30:57.154
-Yeah.
-With you, daniel,
and you, digger.

30:57.156 --> 30:58.956
But after this run,
I say we pack up

30:58.958 --> 31:00.691
and get the hell out
of north carolina.

31:00.693 --> 31:02.359
It's time to vacate it.

31:02.361 --> 31:05.362
[mark]
<i>  we cannot continue hauling</i>
<i>  hundreds of gallons</i>

31:05.364 --> 31:09.066
of limestone water
a hundred miles

31:09.068 --> 31:11.702
to a still site
to make tennessee whiskey.

31:11.704 --> 31:15.105
Time to let it... Go on back
to nature the way we found it.

31:15.107 --> 31:20.210
We need a still site
in the same location
as the limestone water source.

31:20.212 --> 31:22.212
Oh, oh, look at here, boys.

31:22.214 --> 31:23.247
Yep, you got it, boy.

31:23.249 --> 31:25.816
-Hot dang, daniel,
there you go.
-Like a fist.

31:25.818 --> 31:28.986
-Yeah, boy.
-[daniel] all that pop needs
is a clicker stick in it.

31:28.988 --> 31:32.189
[digger] here she comes.
That'll warm her up.

31:32.191 --> 31:34.524
Perfect stream
right there, boys.

31:34.526 --> 31:35.959
[daniel] that does look good.

31:35.961 --> 31:37.995
<i> [mark] don't matter</i>
<i>  if you do it one time</i>
<i>  or a thousand times.</i>

31:37.997 --> 31:39.663
<i>  When the liquor</i>
<i>  starts coming out</i>
<i>  of the worm,</i>

31:39.665 --> 31:41.331
<i>  it gives you a little boost</i>
<i>  of adrenaline.</i>

31:41.333 --> 31:43.500
I'll get these heads out.

31:43.502 --> 31:46.370
I'm charged up.
I'm ready to see
what we've made.

31:49.608 --> 31:51.742
Phew! Damn!

31:51.744 --> 31:56.580
That'll make your damn
sticker pack up
and your feeder feel good.

31:56.582 --> 31:59.483
<i>  Tastes like</i>
<i>  mark and digger's</i>
<i>  tennessee whiskey.</i>

31:59.485 --> 32:04.154
You can, as we have proven,
make tennessee whiskey
in north carolina.

32:08.227 --> 32:10.227
Yeah, let's just get drunk.

32:14.233 --> 32:18.035
Whoa! Damn, damn.

32:18.037 --> 32:21.805
This is way too high
proof jug to be
drinking out of.

32:21.807 --> 32:23.573
Oh,
that's got to be tempered.

32:23.575 --> 32:26.209
It's spot on
to what we've been
making in tennessee.

32:26.211 --> 32:28.312
<i>  So the only difference</i>
<i>  is real estate</i>

32:28.314 --> 32:31.548
it was run on
with just a little ways
across the state line.

32:31.550 --> 32:34.184
You get that block
and I've got a rag.
I'll get the cap.

32:34.186 --> 32:36.853
<i>  That being said,</i>
<i>  we're going to break</i>
<i>  this still down.</i>

32:36.855 --> 32:38.088
<i>  We're going to take it</i>
<i>  out of here.</i>

32:38.090 --> 32:41.291
And this was the last damn run
of liquor made at this spot.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.894
[mark] I want
to get this still up
on digger's back.

32:43.896 --> 32:45.329
I wish other one was
was a lot narrower.

32:45.331 --> 32:48.298
Yeah.
It has a little narrow body.
This is a fat boy.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.734
-You got it?
-I got all I can get.

32:50.736 --> 32:53.203
That's all for this place,
jb rader.

32:54.206 --> 32:57.140
That hump
on the old man's back
helped him out a lot.

32:57.142 --> 32:59.142
[mark] he had something
to balance it on,
didn't he?

32:59.144 --> 33:01.244
-[digger] yep.
-[mark] ain't but one thing
left to do

33:01.246 --> 33:03.146
other than get out of dodge.

33:03.148 --> 33:08.618
The last thing to do
is to take down
popcorn's sign and go home.

33:08.620 --> 33:11.955
I don't guess
this will ever be hung back
here again.

33:11.957 --> 33:13.223
I'd say you're right.

33:13.225 --> 33:15.125
[digger] let's get the hell
out of here.

33:15.127 --> 33:18.762
You know, digger and myself,
now we've got
the unenviable chore

33:18.764 --> 33:23.000
of finding not only limestone
water source
back in tennessee,

33:23.002 --> 33:25.902
<i>  but we've got to find</i>
<i>  a suitable still site</i>

33:25.904 --> 33:29.473
next to that water
and move forward
in our season.

33:39.451 --> 33:43.653
-If we go ahead and
sweat this end of this hook.
-Yeah.

33:50.162 --> 33:52.229
[mark laughing]

33:55.667 --> 33:57.467
son of a bitch.

33:57.469 --> 33:59.403
[mark laughing] I forgot to
open the valve!

34:02.074 --> 34:03.140
Woo-ee!

34:03.142 --> 34:05.042
We made a gun out of
that thing.

34:05.344 --> 34:06.877
I'd say that was shot.

34:06.879 --> 34:09.212
Well, I'm saying I forgot...

34:09.214 --> 34:11.248
[mark laughing]

34:13.185 --> 34:16.653
[huck] damn. Whoo. Dangerous.

34:23.429 --> 34:24.828
[richard] what time is it,
craig?

34:24.830 --> 34:26.930
[craig] it's time
to fire up again.

34:26.932 --> 34:29.299
It's time to run
some moonshine.

34:29.301 --> 34:32.369
Today is the first actual run
of our absinthe.

34:32.371 --> 34:35.572
It's going to be
the best absinthe
anyone's ever made.

34:35.574 --> 34:38.175
Today is the day
we run the sugar wash.

34:38.177 --> 34:39.376
All right.

34:40.846 --> 34:43.080
[richard] all right,
we're going to get
this pumped in.

34:43.082 --> 34:46.016
Smells awesome,
smells like sake,
smells like a rice wine.

34:46.018 --> 34:47.317
I know it's just
sugar and water,

34:47.319 --> 34:49.653
but man, it has some
different notes to it.

34:49.655 --> 34:51.154
<i>  We got</i>
<i>  30 gallons in the barrel.</i>

34:51.156 --> 34:54.124
We're gonna get
right close to three gallons
out of this run.

34:54.126 --> 34:56.159
All right. We're going to put
some heat on this thing.

35:00.899 --> 35:03.100
Man, that smells good.
Mmm-hmm.

35:03.102 --> 35:05.402
[richard] so, craig,
we got a decision
to make, too.

35:05.404 --> 35:08.105
-What's that?
-The guy that made this
order for this absinthe,

35:08.107 --> 35:10.407
he said,
"I could pay you in crypto."

35:11.610 --> 35:12.876
really?

35:12.911 --> 35:14.845
He said he'll probably
give us more than
it's worth in crypto

35:14.847 --> 35:17.114
-'cause it's easy for him
to give it up.
-[craig] he's not lying.

35:17.116 --> 35:20.016
That cryptocurrency
back in the day
when I tried to get you in

35:20.018 --> 35:21.184
was worth 7,000.

35:21.186 --> 35:25.055
That same cryptocurrency
is worth $35,000 today.

35:25.057 --> 35:27.257
<i>  If we accept this crypto</i>
<i>  from this guy,</i>

35:27.259 --> 35:30.427
we stand a chance
of doubling,
maybe tripling our money.

35:30.596 --> 35:33.196
Oh, yeah.

35:33.198 --> 35:36.166
Yeah. But can I walk
in the bank and say,
"I want to see it"?

35:36.168 --> 35:38.401
I walk in the bank
and tell him,
"let me see my money.

35:38.403 --> 35:39.836
-I want to see it."
-[craig] no.

35:39.838 --> 35:41.404
I can see this.

35:41.406 --> 35:43.206
I know what this is.

35:43.208 --> 35:44.975
Cryptocurrency,
you have to hand it to me

35:44.977 --> 35:46.910
on something like this,
a flash drive.

35:46.912 --> 35:49.045
I don't trust something
I can't see.

35:49.047 --> 35:52.249
It's being held
in your wallet
off to the side.

35:52.251 --> 35:53.450
You're your own bank.

35:53.452 --> 35:56.486
Plus, crypto moves
up and down.
I mean, this can go down.

35:56.488 --> 35:58.722
This can take a nosedive
and we could lose everything.

35:58.724 --> 36:00.257
I think
we should take a chance.

36:02.761 --> 36:05.328
You take charge of this one,
I'll let you talk to him
about that.

36:05.330 --> 36:08.265
Craig knows a lot about it,
so I'm going to trust him,

36:08.267 --> 36:10.667
see if what he says
actually works.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.469
There we go. It's dripping.

36:12.471 --> 36:14.671
We're getting
our first little drip drop,

36:14.673 --> 36:16.473
<i>  the beginning</i>
<i>  of something good.</i>

36:16.475 --> 36:18.275
Go ahead and throw that off.

36:20.145 --> 36:22.179
This is 160, 170, for sure.

36:22.181 --> 36:23.713
That's strong, man.

36:23.715 --> 36:27.784
So we're hoping to get
at least three gallons
of our base spirit.

36:27.786 --> 36:30.220
-Get another jar
so we don't lose all of this.
-[craig] oh, yeah.

36:30.222 --> 36:32.989
It's putting off more liquor
than we thought.

36:32.991 --> 36:34.925
[richard]
it's running like crazy.

36:34.927 --> 36:36.393
Man,
this is the last jar, man.

36:36.395 --> 36:37.961
Give me that bucket.

36:37.963 --> 36:39.362
This'll be good to go.

36:39.364 --> 36:41.331
All right. The next thing
that we're gonna do

36:41.333 --> 36:43.900
is we're gonna
take all this distillate
that we got out of here.

36:43.902 --> 36:45.435
We're gonna through
a maceration process.

36:45.437 --> 36:47.003
We're gonna take
the fresh herbals,

36:47.005 --> 36:48.838
the fresh botanicals
that we have,

36:48.840 --> 36:51.675
and we're gonna
put them in here,
let them sit for 24 hours.

36:51.677 --> 36:52.943
Now that we have
our base spirit,

36:52.945 --> 36:55.111
<i>  we're gonna add</i>
<i>  all of these herbs to it.</i>

36:55.113 --> 36:57.347
All right.
So that's 40 grams
of anise seed.

36:57.349 --> 36:58.848
Dump that in there. Dump.

36:58.850 --> 37:00.050
I'm gonna write that down.

37:00.052 --> 37:01.418
<i>  We're weighing</i>
<i>  all these herbs.</i>

37:01.420 --> 37:02.786
<i>  We want to be</i>
<i>  able to replicate this</i>

37:02.788 --> 37:05.021
if this comes out right
and don't have to guess.

37:05.023 --> 37:08.658
Star anise is something else,
man, this is powerful, strong.

37:08.660 --> 37:11.061
<i>  I look at this sugar wash</i>
<i>  like a blank canvas.</i>

37:11.063 --> 37:13.230
All we have to do is
put it on the easel,

37:13.232 --> 37:15.699
get our botanicals
and paint them on.

37:15.701 --> 37:18.268
Spearmint. A little of this
goes a long way.

37:18.270 --> 37:20.704
This high proof alcohol
is going to start
to break down

37:20.706 --> 37:23.940
all of these oils,
which is an essential part
of absinthe.

37:23.942 --> 37:25.909
We're gonna go
with your friend here,

37:25.911 --> 37:28.311
mr. Wormwood
is a staple in this.

37:32.050 --> 37:33.416
-I know.
<i> -[craig] I don't really know</i>

37:33.418 --> 37:35.018
with what we're gonna
end up with.

37:35.020 --> 37:37.821
Hopefully, it doesn't taste
nothing like wormwood.

37:37.823 --> 37:40.156
Man, we got a concoction here.

37:40.158 --> 37:41.424
<i> [richard] so we dump</i>
<i>  all this into here.</i>

37:41.426 --> 37:43.059
We let it sit
for 24 hours.

37:43.061 --> 37:44.928
All of these oils
are gonna soak out.

37:44.930 --> 37:46.129
Hold both sides of the cap.

37:46.131 --> 37:48.098
We lose that, you're gonna
have to swim home.

37:48.100 --> 37:50.033
We'll come back in
and run it through the still.

37:50.035 --> 37:53.169
<i>  What comes out</i>
<i>  at this point</i>
<i>  is a white absinthe.</i>

37:53.171 --> 37:55.438
We want to be
careful with this.
There's a lot at stake here.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.307
We don't have
a whole lot of alcohol
to work with.

37:57.309 --> 38:00.176
All right. Well, that's it.
Let's go ahead
and get out of here, man.

38:00.178 --> 38:02.412
The stakes are real high.
We got one shot at this.

38:02.414 --> 38:04.014
We're gonna make sure
we do this right.

38:04.016 --> 38:06.349
[birds chirping]

38:18.130 --> 38:21.298
there are springs
in every cave over there
on that bluff.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.766
<i>  That's all limestone.</i>

38:22.768 --> 38:24.200
[mark] pull in here
and let's look.

38:24.202 --> 38:26.269
Digger and I, you know,
we're back in tennessee

38:26.271 --> 38:28.204
on a hunt
for a limestone water.

38:28.206 --> 38:31.941
<i>  In order for us</i>
<i>  to continue in making</i>
<i>  tennessee whiskey,</i>

38:31.943 --> 38:35.211
we need both
our limestone water
and our still site

38:35.213 --> 38:37.047
in exactly the same place.

38:37.049 --> 38:39.249
Every bit of this
is limestone,
end-to-end.

38:39.251 --> 38:42.052
Now there's a spring,
comes out of that bluff
right there.

38:42.054 --> 38:44.921
<i> [mark] there's a lot</i>
<i>  of limestone springs</i>
<i>  around here,</i>

38:44.923 --> 38:48.825
but, you know, sadly,
we've not found anything
very promising at all.

38:48.827 --> 38:51.394
<i>  And we're getting down</i>
<i>  pretty low</i>
<i>  on the bottom of the list.</i>

38:51.396 --> 38:54.998
So, you know, it's...
It's soon or never, I guess.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.700
We'd be safe over there,
but...

38:56.702 --> 38:58.301
Can't get to none of it.

38:58.303 --> 39:01.938
<i> [digger] when I was, you know,</i>
<i>  15, 16, 17 years old</i>

39:01.940 --> 39:04.474
it wasn't anything
to climb up them rock bluffs,

39:04.476 --> 39:07.410
but anymore, I can't,
I can't do it.

39:07.412 --> 39:09.346
[mark] and don't matter
how much good water we find,

39:09.348 --> 39:10.914
if we can't access it.

39:10.916 --> 39:13.416
-[digger] moving on.
-[mark] moving on here, boss.

39:13.418 --> 39:16.252
Well, let's go up here
at this one little old spot.

39:16.254 --> 39:17.854
I used to own that property.

39:17.856 --> 39:19.189
Wish I still did.

39:19.191 --> 39:23.026
It's got
a real good spring on it.
It's right up here.

39:23.729 --> 39:26.062
Well, that pretty much
says it all.

39:26.064 --> 39:28.365
[mark] oh, yeah.
Well, that don't look good.

39:28.367 --> 39:30.700
We're getting nowhere
in a great big hurry.

39:30.702 --> 39:31.868
Well...

39:31.970 --> 39:34.871
<i>  We have zero options</i>
<i>  after a whole day of hunting.</i>

39:34.873 --> 39:36.906
I'm horribly disheartened
with this.

39:36.908 --> 39:40.977
<i>  We need a still site</i>
<i>  that's close a good source</i>
<i>  of limestone water</i>

39:40.979 --> 39:43.113
<i>  that we've got a footprint</i>
<i>  to set a bigger still,</i>

39:43.115 --> 39:47.684
where we can
ramp up production,
and we need it now.

39:47.686 --> 39:50.120
The only thing I know to do
ahead is go down here

39:50.122 --> 39:53.857
and talk to john
down here at english mountain
spring water.

39:53.859 --> 39:55.992
You know, the guy
that owns the english
mountain spring water

39:55.994 --> 39:58.328
is a guy by the name
of john burleson.

39:58.330 --> 40:00.296
<i>  Digger knows john</i>
<i>  better than I do,</i>

40:00.298 --> 40:03.400
but english mountain
spring water was judged

40:03.402 --> 40:08.071
and voted to be
the best tasting water
in the world.

40:08.073 --> 40:10.340
Hell, we ain't got nothing
to lose.

40:10.342 --> 40:13.877
We'll just approach him
with kind of bended knees
and hat in hand.

40:13.879 --> 40:17.247
The mineral content's perfect.
It's... It's good and sweet.

40:17.249 --> 40:19.115
I know it's limestone water.

40:19.117 --> 40:22.385
We've got tempering water
out of it for years
from the runoff.

40:22.387 --> 40:24.621
Reckon you can pull
a nose hair
out of your nose

40:24.623 --> 40:27.023
-and maybe tear
up a little bit?
-I don't know.

40:27.025 --> 40:30.393
Hell, we've looked hell west
and crooked
for limestone water.

40:30.395 --> 40:33.062
<i>  This is pretty much</i>
<i>  the end of the line for us.</i>

40:33.064 --> 40:34.464
<i>  We don't know</i>
<i>  where else to look.</i>

40:34.466 --> 40:38.234
We have to make this
source of water work for us.

40:39.271 --> 40:41.771
[digger] it's our last
resort right here.

40:41.773 --> 40:44.674
We're going to ask john
at english mountain
spring water

40:44.676 --> 40:48.278
if we can run liquor
at his facility,
on his spring,

40:48.280 --> 40:50.947
<i>  you know, away</i>
<i>  from his business.</i>

40:50.949 --> 40:54.451
Um, but I think the likelihood
is slim to none.

40:55.887 --> 40:58.888
[mark] well, I guess, no luck.

40:58.890 --> 41:02.158
That's what we'll call it.
We're kind of
out of choices here.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.226
Right.

41:03.228 --> 41:04.327
Can I help you?

41:05.163 --> 41:06.696
Hey, how are you?

41:06.698 --> 41:08.231
You wouldn't happen
to remember us,
would you?

41:08.233 --> 41:09.866
I do.

41:09.868 --> 41:12.769
[digger] well, we've...
We've come back to you
again to talk.

41:12.771 --> 41:13.870
[john] good to see you.

41:13.872 --> 41:15.972
We have a request
we'd like to make.

41:15.974 --> 41:18.308
We'd like to talk
about your water.

41:18.310 --> 41:22.078
We really was wondering
if you'd care
if we captured a little of it.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.948
And let us come in here
and run on this spot.
