A FILM BY
HEIKKI KUJANPÄÄ.

00:22.189 --> 00:26.360
The Finnish Cicil War has ended
in the victory of the Whites

00:26.444 --> 00:28.821
assisted by the Imperial German Army.

00:30.573 --> 00:34.076
More than 80,000 Reds have been
locked up in prison camps.

00:34.160 --> 00:37.621
Thousands have already been executed,
or have starved to death.

00:39.331 --> 00:43.044
Rebel leaders not captured yet
have gone into hiding,

00:43.127 --> 00:46.505
fearing discovery.

There's no one here.

04:15.089 --> 04:18.050
Halt!

Halt!

05:02.303 --> 05:07.516
LAUGH OR DIE

05:12.980 --> 05:16.984
Any leaders?
Go!

05:22.823 --> 05:25.951
Go home.

05:38.714 --> 05:41.717
Go home, women.

05:51.643 --> 05:54.646
Any leaders?

06:25.552 --> 06:28.097
Go!

06:48.325 --> 06:51.995
Fall in!
This way!

07:14.351 --> 07:17.813
Get him on his feet! Move!

07:48.302 --> 07:51.263
Form three lines!

08:00.189 --> 08:02.399
Attention!

08:03.817 --> 08:09.239
A straight line!
Don't lean against the wall! Rautio!

08:25.130 --> 08:29.885
Repeat after me.
One, two, three. You there.

08:29.968 --> 08:32.471
One.
Thank you.

08:36.517 --> 08:39.645
You there. Let's hear it.

08:41.980 --> 08:44.650
One, two. Death to the Russkies!

08:47.152 --> 08:48.612
Your name?

08:51.281 --> 08:53.283
Your name?

08:55.369 --> 08:59.164
What's so funny? Your name!

09:00.749 --> 09:02.918
Toby Belch.

09:03.001 --> 09:05.671
Toby... Belch.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.053
Belch.

10:05.689 --> 10:10.485
How many are we?
Over a thousand in early summer.

10:10.569 --> 10:14.114
Half of the Parliament's
Socialists were there.

10:14.197 --> 10:16.241
Only a few left now.

10:29.171 --> 10:30.881
Aulis!

11:11.922 --> 11:17.552
<i>Scourge of the ruling class
Sent to Hades, sent to jail</i>

11:17.636 --> 11:23.266
<i>Summarily hanged, shot</i>

11:23.350 --> 11:26.186
<i>Hero of the Revolution</i>

11:26.269 --> 11:28.939
Parikka?

11:29.022 --> 11:34.986
<i>Freedom carries a heavy price</i>

11:39.866 --> 11:43.453
There's still justice in the world.

11:46.832 --> 11:49.876
Where are the rest? Johansson?

11:51.878 --> 11:55.549
Where did you go?
You were to get help.

11:55.632 --> 11:59.469
Headquarters was deserted.
You left us.

11:59.553 --> 12:02.431
I couldn't get back through
that artillery fire.

12:02.514 --> 12:07.394
You were seen at the Station.
On the leaders' escape train.

12:07.477 --> 12:10.480
Who made us join the Guard?
Women, too.

12:10.564 --> 12:14.276
Where's Tyyne now?
Pregnant, in some camp!

12:14.359 --> 12:17.070
You're pretty well fed.
Got anything to eat?

12:17.154 --> 12:19.656
No.
Liar!

12:22.325 --> 12:24.244
Russki tack bread!

12:27.080 --> 12:29.916
We're here because of you!

12:43.889 --> 12:46.641
Do you still have nightmares?

12:46.725 --> 12:49.436
No, Captain.

12:49.519 --> 12:53.523
It's the sea air. It hardens you.

12:55.025 --> 12:57.569
Siikander is the best tailor
in Helsinki.

12:57.652 --> 13:01.114
He made Bobrikov the suit
he was shot in.

13:01.198 --> 13:04.493
I have a job for you.

13:05.368 --> 13:08.205
We have far too many prisoners.

13:08.288 --> 13:12.417
You have three weeks
to get rid of these. Three weeks?

13:12.501 --> 13:16.296
Head of the Prison Service
Major Juvelius will inspect the camp.

13:16.379 --> 13:20.050
We must get these off the roster.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.469
And I need a new uniform.

13:27.349 --> 13:30.685
You will now carry out
the executions.

13:30.769 --> 13:33.980
Can you handle it now?

13:34.064 --> 13:37.025
Yes, Captain.

13:37.108 --> 13:41.112
Just close your eyes when you
give the order. It'll be all right.

14:15.355 --> 14:19.192
What were you looking at? The city?

14:19.276 --> 14:23.196
German naval manoeuvres.

14:30.996 --> 14:34.124
In three weeks' time I'll take you
to Hotel Kämp for an eggnog.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.501
Or to a concert. I promise.

14:37.377 --> 14:40.672
I enjoy myself here quite well.

14:42.424 --> 14:47.762
Helen! Would you sing
for Major Juvelius' entourage?

14:48.972 --> 14:52.434
The piano is out of tune.

15:00.650 --> 15:05.655
Get inside!
No loitering outside after dark.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.830

DRAMATIS PERSONAE
TOBY BELCH

16:55.682 --> 17:01.896
<i>0 knight!
Thou lack (st a cup of canary!</i>

17:14.701 --> 17:17.704
Toby Belch.

17:18.329 --> 17:23.042
I saw you in that role.
Couldn't think of a better name?

17:24.502 --> 17:30.216
Alfred Nyborg.
Nyborg?

17:30.300 --> 17:33.219
Gunnar's son?
One and the same.

17:33.303 --> 17:38.016
I'll be damned. You were in breeches
when I saw you last.

17:38.141 --> 17:41.603
What happened to your face?

17:51.279 --> 17:54.866
What are you doing here?
Why didn't you say who you are?

17:54.949 --> 17:58.203
You've got MPs here, too.

17:58.286 --> 18:01.873
Did you join the rebellion? Why?

18:01.956 --> 18:05.919
You'd only got the Russkies
back in power again.

18:08.004 --> 18:11.049
From Russkies to Fritzes.

18:11.174 --> 18:14.803
We'll soon have a German king,
won't we?

18:14.886 --> 18:18.807
The Parliament
will decide on it soon.

18:18.890 --> 18:22.852
I'm happy it's all over now.

18:22.936 --> 18:27.941
Perhaps I'll see you on stage again.
Tell me.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.862
All leaders will be shot, right?

18:35.907 --> 18:37.992
A leader?

18:48.920 --> 18:53.091
So, between us leaders.

19:06.896 --> 19:10.483
To the end of the line!
Thanks. I ate already.

19:12.110 --> 19:15.864
What's with Hannula? He's been
like that since they shot Elmeri.

19:15.947 --> 19:18.449
You'll find another one yet.

19:18.533 --> 19:23.621
Theatre people! Fall in!

19:23.705 --> 19:26.666
Fall in!

19:29.127 --> 19:33.173
Where are the rest? What do you
think? In wooden overcoats.

19:33.298 --> 19:35.508
Shut up!

19:37.093 --> 19:40.889
You laugh at me? Damn you!

19:42.140 --> 19:44.767
Get up!

19:44.851 --> 19:48.646
Right turn! Right!

19:48.730 --> 19:54.360
Didn't you learn anything
in the Red Guard? Forward march!

19:54.444 --> 19:59.824
Where're we going? Must be
the amnesty. It was in the papers.

19:59.908 --> 20:04.621
Workers' Theatre people.
Leave your cups here.

20:22.513 --> 20:25.475
Kasimir Elo, actor.

20:25.558 --> 20:30.563
Born 3 February 1874
in the Parish of Helsinki.

20:35.610 --> 20:41.491
Where were you in the evening
of April 12, this year?

20:41.574 --> 20:45.036
At the theatre.
Taking care of the wounded.

20:46.746 --> 20:50.750
Any witnesses?

20:50.833 --> 20:55.713
Why?
According to Lieutenant Winge

20:55.797 --> 21:00.593
his unit was shot at from
the Workers' Theatre. We never shot.

21:00.677 --> 21:04.973
That's what it says in here.
We haven't shot anyone.

21:05.056 --> 21:08.351
Why did you have guns
when arrested?

21:08.434 --> 21:12.563
We were ordered to.
Who gave the order?

21:21.072 --> 21:24.784
If the one responsible is not
discovered, the duty of this court...

21:24.867 --> 21:29.205
We never shot anyone.
Parikka! Tell them!

21:29.289 --> 21:31.874
We were out of ammunition!

21:40.800 --> 21:44.387
Who's he?
He's Parikka!

21:52.270 --> 21:58.109
Toivo Parikka, the actor? Did he give
you orders? Yes! He put us up to it.

22:01.195 --> 22:03.531
A leader and an agitator.

22:03.614 --> 22:06.492
You know that it means
a death sentence?

22:06.576 --> 22:08.911
Shall I tell him?
No.

22:08.995 --> 22:12.206
Do you admit that your unit
fired upon the Germans?

22:15.918 --> 22:18.296
Them?

22:20.590 --> 22:24.677
They can't even to load a gun.

22:24.761 --> 22:30.433
I killed them. No use to sentence
these shitpants for it.

22:31.934 --> 22:35.563
How did you singlehanded

22:36.814 --> 22:40.777
shoot twelve German
Special Forces soldiers?

22:41.486 --> 22:44.906
I had twelve bullets left.

22:50.828 --> 22:56.584
Tell us. How did you manage that?

23:00.088 --> 23:03.883
I was watching

23:05.718 --> 23:10.681
on the Linnunlaulu cliff
as the Germans approached.

23:14.268 --> 23:17.188
Their artillery fire
was quite accurate.

23:17.271 --> 23:20.691
Had to watch my step.

23:22.819 --> 23:26.948
There went the People's House tower.
Well, it was ugly anyway.

23:29.575 --> 23:32.995
I met Helander the cobbler.

23:33.079 --> 23:37.166
He told me that the Fritzes had just
burned down the Turku Barracks,

23:37.250 --> 23:38.876
with the men inside.

23:38.960 --> 23:41.879
Luckily he had some
moonshine with him.

23:41.963 --> 23:46.843
We sat on the stairs of the Kallio
church, drank the whole bottle dry.

23:46.926 --> 23:49.887
Helander went
to look for his old lady.

23:49.971 --> 23:53.099
I went into the church,
it kept rumbling outside.

23:53.182 --> 23:57.937
"How could I help
the workers' cause?"

23:58.020 --> 24:01.524
I went and crapped in the pulpit!

24:01.607 --> 24:06.654
Then I headed for the Theatre.
The Fritzes were banging at the door.

24:06.737 --> 24:11.242
Going in without a ticket!
Now that won't do at all.

24:11.325 --> 24:14.036
So I climbed to the roof.

24:14.120 --> 24:18.416
I shot the last in line,
his ears stuck out a mile.

24:20.376 --> 24:23.588
Then I knelt down,
shouted into the drainpipe:

24:23.671 --> 24:25.256
<i>Stillgestanden!</i>

24:27.592 --> 24:32.972
The whole platoon stood at attention.

24:34.390 --> 24:38.186
I started to pick them off.

24:40.730 --> 24:45.109
<i>No muddy boots
to the Temple of Thalia!</i>

24:45.193 --> 24:50.281
<i>Buy yourself a ticket!
Soldiers at half price!</i>

24:51.073 --> 24:55.161
<i>No private bottles
into the auditorium.</i>

25:18.434 --> 25:22.230
How stupid do you think I am?

25:22.313 --> 25:24.524
Pretty stupid, sir.

25:24.649 --> 25:28.069
Don't you know how
to behave in a courtroom?

25:28.152 --> 25:33.366
What kind of a man are you?
The funniest man in Finland.

25:33.449 --> 25:38.204
I've got it in black and white.
Printed in "Helsingin Sanomat".

25:42.166 --> 25:44.835
Very well.

25:44.919 --> 25:50.007
We sentence the Workers' Theatre
Red Guard company to death

25:50.091 --> 25:54.136
for complicity in the...
Why all of us?

25:54.220 --> 25:57.306
We're innocent, the rest of us!
Parikka confessed!

25:57.390 --> 26:02.186
You were all in it!
Take the condemned away!

26:12.655 --> 26:15.741
God in your mercy.

26:15.825 --> 26:19.704
Wipe away my wrongdoings.

26:19.787 --> 26:25.334
Wash me clean of my crimes
and cleanse me of my sins.

26:25.418 --> 26:31.757
For I know my transgressions
and my sins will always be before me.

26:31.841 --> 26:37.722
Behold, I was born in sin
and my mother begat me in sin.

26:37.805 --> 26:41.934
Behold, you want the truth
to live in my heart.

26:42.018 --> 26:45.438
You teach me to learn wisdom.

27:52.254 --> 27:55.591
That's the theatre crew.

28:22.660 --> 28:24.662
Get it on already.

28:30.459 --> 28:33.337
Stand arms!

28:33.421 --> 28:37.425
Excuse me.
Want to hear a funny story?

28:46.600 --> 28:49.895
Load!

28:49.979 --> 28:55.484
Gunnar Nyborg, the Sergeant Major's
father, was my Sunday school teacher.

28:55.568 --> 28:59.196
A small, sweaty man,
always talking about Jesus.

29:08.914 --> 29:11.751
Aim!

29:11.834 --> 29:15.963
One time he asked: "What's brown
and furry with whiskers?"

29:16.046 --> 29:19.967
Normally a squirrel, I said.
But since you're asking

29:20.050 --> 29:22.344
it must be Jesus.

29:35.608 --> 29:37.610
Stop!

29:40.112 --> 29:43.783
Did you really think
you'd get off this easy?

29:45.034 --> 29:48.037
I can make jokes, too!

29:50.372 --> 29:54.168
Take the prisoners into the camp.
This one into the stable.

30:04.470 --> 30:07.473
Remember to close
your eyes next time.

30:18.943 --> 30:22.321
<i>What are you eating? That's not fair!</i>

30:22.404 --> 30:28.160
<i>I've got matchsticks! I'll torch the
stable if you won't share your food!</i>

30:35.292 --> 30:38.420
You are talented.

30:38.504 --> 30:41.465
A talented bullshitter.

30:41.549 --> 30:44.635
I have a job for you.

30:46.470 --> 30:50.474
The King of Finland?
I can consider that.

30:53.185 --> 30:57.857
The Head of the Prison Service
comes here in three weeks' time.

30:59.692 --> 31:03.153
You will perform for his entourage.

31:03.237 --> 31:05.406
You will make a comedy.

31:05.489 --> 31:09.201
If it is amusing,
you and your comrades may live.

31:09.285 --> 31:13.747
The Sgt Major will supervise
the rehearsals. Get down to work.

31:13.831 --> 31:16.709
You have eighteen days.

31:16.792 --> 31:20.546
Make the audience laugh
or you will be shot.

31:22.464 --> 31:27.177
<i>What am I accused of?
I haven't done anything wrong!</i>

31:33.767 --> 31:36.645
<i>Give me something to eat!</i>

32:22.107 --> 32:26.862
Well? What've you been plotting
with those butchers?

32:26.946 --> 32:30.282
What's that?
A play.

32:30.366 --> 32:33.744
Which play?
A comedy.

33:09.196 --> 33:13.617
What's he writing?
Go and ask.

33:23.585 --> 33:29.008
How did it go? The Provost came...
His soninlaw's in the cupboard.

33:29.133 --> 33:33.387
But it's the boy's father.
How does it go?

33:33.470 --> 33:39.893
"Gracious me! If I only could
get back my unfortunate letter!"

33:42.646 --> 33:47.484
Good. Are you writing "The Marriage
Plot of Provost Pettersson"?

33:47.568 --> 33:52.031
It drew full houses for weeks.
It has female roles, too.

33:53.032 --> 33:56.827
That razor turns you
into a woman in a flash.

33:56.910 --> 34:02.166
You know where he brought it here?

34:04.626 --> 34:09.922
How about my stupid maid
with a droopy chin? "Gracious!"

34:10.007 --> 34:15.054
We'll write her in. You can't put
all the funny characters in one play.

34:15.179 --> 34:19.641
Why not? Who's in?

34:20.893 --> 34:26.356
Who wants to live? I bloody well
won't clown around for the butchers.

34:26.440 --> 34:30.694
They'll shoot us after the play.
We lost the war already.

34:36.283 --> 34:40.913
Hannula? Like to do
one more play with us?

34:40.996 --> 34:43.998
Not without Elmeri.

34:45.583 --> 34:49.838
Dig a deep hole and bury this in it.

34:52.591 --> 34:57.262
Remember the churchwarden
who walked like this?

34:58.847 --> 35:02.476
Remember?
Vehviläinen, the churchwarden.

35:02.559 --> 35:06.897
Short legs, a quick step!
Good, Hannula.

35:06.980 --> 35:12.736
Real tight ass! Hands working
elegantly! He's so important!

35:12.820 --> 35:17.991
Would a maid walk like that?
Would I be a girl?

35:27.751 --> 35:30.754
Fall in!

35:41.056 --> 35:44.059
Stand arms!

35:48.355 --> 35:51.024
Aim!

35:54.278 --> 35:56.738
Fire!

35:58.157 --> 36:00.951
Shoulder arms.

36:22.556 --> 36:27.519
Your father must be proud of you.
Sending so many godless men to hell.

36:29.563 --> 36:31.982
Were you at the front?

36:36.403 --> 36:39.364
Six months in the German Army.

36:41.950 --> 36:45.621
It was nothing compared to Vyborg.

36:45.704 --> 36:48.707
What happened there?

36:50.083 --> 36:53.086
Everyone got killed.

36:53.170 --> 36:56.798
All Russians, both Reds
and the burghers.

36:58.759 --> 37:01.762
All were shot by the wall.

37:05.682 --> 37:09.811
Women and children in high piles.

37:09.895 --> 37:12.814
Who did it?

37:15.442 --> 37:18.153
Our company.

37:26.370 --> 37:32.542
You have to look forward.
We have a premiere coming.

37:34.503 --> 37:39.508
First things first.
Have you any food?

37:47.891 --> 37:53.105
Where will we perform?
Not in the camp? No.

38:07.160 --> 38:12.165
We need props.
Instruments, costumes.

38:40.652 --> 38:44.197
Sergeant Major!
Mrs Kalm.

38:44.281 --> 38:46.783
You're preparing a comedy.

38:46.867 --> 38:50.454
Your husband promised to spare
the actors if they will perform.

38:50.537 --> 38:52.664
My husband wants me
to make sure that the play

38:52.748 --> 38:56.543
will be highclass enough
for Major Juvelius.

38:56.626 --> 38:59.796
I prepared a play for
the Folk Education Society.

38:59.880 --> 39:05.052
And I want to meet
this Mr Parikka. Take me to the camp.

39:05.135 --> 39:08.055
I don't think you should, Mrs Kalm.

39:08.138 --> 39:11.058
Tell him I intend to be present.

39:11.141 --> 39:14.019
To see that the play
will be suitable.

39:29.868 --> 39:32.954
They are all too small.

39:37.709 --> 39:40.712
Now it will fit.

39:49.388 --> 39:53.308
Not that one. It belongs to my son.

39:54.768 --> 39:59.064
I've heard stories about you.

39:59.147 --> 40:01.942
Must be true, all of them.

40:02.025 --> 40:05.779
You have at least twelve children
in Helsinki alone.

40:05.862 --> 40:10.325
And your father is a Turkish sultan.
That's not true.

40:13.286 --> 40:16.081
I've got fourteen.

40:19.793 --> 40:22.003
I will come to your rehearsals.

40:22.087 --> 40:26.174
Sgt Major will tell you
when we have something to show.

40:27.384 --> 40:31.221
Is this fine?
Something's missing.

40:34.141 --> 40:37.018
Wouldn't this fit him better?

40:39.271 --> 40:41.982
Do you know how to walk in it?

41:05.505 --> 41:09.676
It was our son's violin.
Was?

41:21.062 --> 41:24.691
Imagine yourselves
with tail feathers, like peacocks.

41:24.774 --> 41:28.361
Hannula, that's a chicken.

41:37.787 --> 41:40.290
Amusing.

41:49.841 --> 41:53.803
Let's see it again.

41:53.887 --> 41:57.224
Oh yeah.

41:57.307 --> 42:02.145
Let us borrow it.
I won't, not to him.

42:02.229 --> 42:07.901
He's a fine man, knows how to play.
A man? That one?

42:09.361 --> 42:12.948
You'll get it back.
I won't.

42:18.411 --> 42:22.415
They made us come.
Doesn't smell of shit here.

42:22.499 --> 42:25.460
But something sure stinks.

42:33.552 --> 42:38.890
Elo. You're Elvira.
The other leading role.

42:42.310 --> 42:44.396
Comrades!

42:46.064 --> 42:50.986
Do you know what this is?
Your ticket

42:51.069 --> 42:54.864
out of here. Aulis.

42:54.948 --> 43:00.161
You want to see your bride?
And that kid you'll have?

43:04.499 --> 43:07.252
Did I betray you?

43:07.335 --> 43:11.798
Was surviving my crime? No.

43:12.424 --> 43:16.386
Here's our final struggle!

43:16.469 --> 43:19.556
It's middling shit!

43:19.639 --> 43:24.644
But you need to show that you are
greater actors than this text!

43:24.769 --> 43:29.232
Rise above it! Show that even here

43:29.316 --> 43:32.277
you can achieve something so unique

43:32.360 --> 43:36.156
that even the Prison Service
head devil will fart of joy!

43:36.239 --> 43:38.366
That just for a moment,
the world is

43:38.450 --> 43:42.370
one governmental fart's
worth a better place.

43:58.845 --> 44:03.433
Right! Listen up!
Here's a chest of drawers.

44:03.516 --> 44:07.520
Here's a door. And this is a sofa.

44:09.105 --> 44:12.567
Johansson, you're a coffee table.

44:12.651 --> 44:16.655
You fine with no lines?

44:18.615 --> 44:21.242
Why not?

44:32.921 --> 44:38.385
How wonderful to be back home!

44:38.968 --> 44:44.307
I can't wait to tell
the happy news to my father.

44:44.391 --> 44:49.437
Oh, my dear Augustin!
Dear Elvira!

44:49.521 --> 44:54.401
How's my hair?
Wonderful, darling!

44:57.278 --> 44:59.739
My trousers!

44:59.864 --> 45:02.742
My father! He...

45:02.867 --> 45:06.246
He will...

45:08.206 --> 45:12.961
Don't say.
Don't say, I'll remember it soon.

45:13.044 --> 45:16.965
Bring him the text.
We'll take another scene.

45:20.260 --> 45:24.514
Don't give up on the first day!

45:24.597 --> 45:29.018
Who the hell are you
to boss us around? Theatre Manager.

45:29.102 --> 45:33.982
As Mr janitor well knows.
You never were a proper socialist.

45:34.065 --> 45:38.069
You wanted to be a leader
as it's the biggest role.

45:48.288 --> 45:51.791
This is going nowhere.
You can see how weak they are.

45:51.916 --> 45:55.003
We need proper food
to give them strength!

45:55.086 --> 45:59.424
There is no food. The Germans took
everything the Russkies left here.

45:59.507 --> 46:03.511
There's food here. I've seen it.

46:06.890 --> 46:10.643
Do you want the play?

46:10.727 --> 46:15.315
Or shall I go swimming?
You'll have to shoot me.

46:15.398 --> 46:20.361
It's seven kilometres to mainland.
I'll swim eight just to be certain.

46:20.445 --> 46:24.157
What food? Where?

46:43.009 --> 46:46.930
I'll have to shoot you
if we get caught here!

47:30.723 --> 47:34.018
A loaf for the lords,
with real flour.

47:35.186 --> 47:37.772
Look!

47:48.658 --> 47:53.913
And that's not all. We won't
open this until the premiere.

47:54.622 --> 47:59.210
Explain! Search the room!

47:59.294 --> 48:03.631
Those foodstuffs were for
the Prison Service delegation

48:03.715 --> 48:08.052
arriving here in two weeks.
Shall I now feed them lichen?

48:11.055 --> 48:15.351
Why do you think the guilty party
is one of the guards?

48:15.435 --> 48:18.021
The prisoners
are behind lock and key.

48:18.104 --> 48:22.692
Lot of trash
among the conscripts, too.

48:22.775 --> 48:24.736
Republicans.

48:24.819 --> 48:28.740
Captain, sir! Nothing here.

48:31.576 --> 48:35.580
The punishment will be
exceptionally severe.

48:37.081 --> 48:39.292
You know what that means.

48:40.919 --> 48:43.004
I'll look into it.

48:54.724 --> 48:57.727
Eat faster.

49:00.146 --> 49:03.399
Parikka.
Yes?

49:05.568 --> 49:09.113
About those Germans.

49:11.115 --> 49:13.076
It was me.

49:14.285 --> 49:17.372
But I only shot one.

49:17.455 --> 49:22.627
Not more. I did shoot at another one
too, but he didn't die.

49:25.922 --> 49:29.300
I knew that.

49:38.851 --> 49:43.314
Here's some for Mr janitor.

49:43.398 --> 49:48.319
A people's sausage!
Socialized from the Commandant.

49:48.403 --> 49:51.531
Eat it for the cause.

50:11.592 --> 50:14.721
Break's over.
Hide the sausages in your clothing!

50:24.397 --> 50:28.443
Well now. Show me what you've got.

50:31.821 --> 50:35.742
Sit down, please.

50:37.285 --> 50:41.247
From the top. Hannula.

50:56.429 --> 50:59.432
Make one for me, too?

51:00.767 --> 51:03.352
For the role.

51:06.105 --> 51:10.610
Perhaps. If there's any fabric left.

51:10.693 --> 51:13.821
Make it as tight as possible.

51:28.586 --> 51:30.463
Good day, ma'am.

51:30.546 --> 51:35.009
Can any of you play the violin?
Yes. Thank you.

51:38.888 --> 51:42.350
Did you fight in Tampere?

51:44.185 --> 51:45.228
No.

51:47.438 --> 51:51.109
Good.
Is that where your son...

51:53.402 --> 51:56.072
Last day of March.

51:56.155 --> 52:00.201
The commander ordered them to attack
while he ran away from the line.

52:00.284 --> 52:05.123
They were surrounded.
They had no chance.

52:10.128 --> 52:12.672
Here.

52:18.761 --> 52:21.722
Thank you.

52:43.161 --> 52:47.331
Dear Augustin!
Only death can do us apart!

52:50.626 --> 52:52.461
Bravo! Bravo!

52:55.381 --> 52:57.425
Stop!

53:14.984 --> 53:18.863
Hjalmar. No!

53:22.366 --> 53:25.036
Carry on.

53:30.249 --> 53:33.085
Give me a scarf.

53:33.502 --> 53:36.505
Aulis. You got a hole
in your trousers.

53:40.092 --> 53:42.553
Forgive me.

53:42.637 --> 53:47.183
Damn you, Elo!
We have a premiere coming!

53:48.267 --> 53:52.146
Keep your eyes open!

54:24.470 --> 54:27.056
Make your play yourself!

54:27.139 --> 54:31.060
Nothing will come of it
if you shoot the actors!

54:31.143 --> 54:33.771
Where did the prisoner
get the sausage?

54:33.854 --> 54:39.277
Any ideas, Nyborg?
Who let him out of the camp?

54:54.000 --> 54:59.046
I won't act for you any more.
Captain, some Germans are coming.

55:04.468 --> 55:07.847
You will, if you want
to save your comrades.

55:07.930 --> 55:12.935
But you will be shot anyway.
Right after the performance.

55:38.711 --> 55:40.296
<i>Good evening, Lieutenant.</i>

55:40.379 --> 55:45.968
<i>The Parliament will vote about
the monarchy tonight.</i>

55:46.052 --> 55:52.141
<i>The Finnish conscripts are to be
disarmed until tomorrow morning.</i>

55:52.224 --> 55:54.060
<i>But Why?</i>

55:54.143 --> 55:58.564
<i>My men will obey my orders
even if they aren't monarchists.</i>

55:58.647 --> 56:03.277
<i>We were instructed to take
no risks with conscripts.</i>

56:03.361 --> 56:06.238
<i>Your rifle!</i>

56:08.532 --> 56:11.702
<i>All right.
This is for you.</i>

56:12.620 --> 56:14.789
<i>From Headquarters.</i>

56:16.165 --> 56:17.917
<i>Let's go!</i>

56:55.621 --> 56:58.082
Wait.

58:34.470 --> 58:37.097
Helen!

58:37.181 --> 58:40.935
General von der Goltz and
Protector of the State will visit us!

58:41.018 --> 58:45.689
Why on earth? They want to transfer
all prisoners to work in Germany.

58:45.773 --> 58:48.692
They're not fit for work,
they can hardly stand.

58:48.776 --> 58:51.570
This is our chance
to get away from here.

58:51.695 --> 58:57.451
I must impress the General. I might
get a job at the Headquarters.

58:59.453 --> 59:02.289
Evenings in the Kappeli again!

59:02.373 --> 59:06.418
Thank God I had the foresight
to have a new uniform made.

59:10.130 --> 59:14.426
We don't have anything to offer.
They'll be here day after tomorrow.

59:18.847 --> 59:22.393
Well, you have
the funniest man in Finland.

59:27.565 --> 59:29.567
Helen!

59:50.921 --> 59:52.756
Hey!

59:52.840 --> 59:57.761
<i>What are you doing?
Aren't we on the same side?</i>

59:57.845 --> 01:00:01.098
<i>Would the Sergeant Major
kindly give up his weapon?</i>

01:00:01.181 --> 01:00:07.521
<i>No, he would not. My regrets.
The Sergeant Major will not give up.</i>

01:00:07.605 --> 01:00:11.025
<i>Let him keep his weapon.
He's completely harmless.</i>

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:13.944
<i>Harmless? Me?</i>

01:00:17.948 --> 01:00:20.075
<i>Please!</i>

01:00:24.538 --> 01:00:27.207
<i>The weapon!</i>

01:00:36.425 --> 01:00:39.094
<i>Enough!</i>

01:00:40.262 --> 01:00:43.140
<i>Lock the doors.</i>

01:01:07.039 --> 01:01:10.042
Walk. Go, go!

01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:13.921
What's happened to you?
Sit down!

01:01:17.091 --> 01:01:19.551
Sit:

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:38.737
Drink!

01:01:41.782 --> 01:01:45.119
The guards are locked in tonight.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:50.666
Senate orders, while the Parliament
decides whether we'll get one

01:01:50.749 --> 01:01:57.381
of Kaiser's idiot sons
as our king or not.

01:01:59.466 --> 01:02:02.678
Guards are prisoners?

01:02:10.686 --> 01:02:14.440
Here's the key to that gate.

01:02:14.523 --> 01:02:17.818
There's a rowboat in the port.

01:02:23.157 --> 01:02:25.909
You'll go to prison for this.

01:02:25.993 --> 01:02:30.664
You're too great an actor
to die for those others!

01:02:34.168 --> 01:02:37.963
Here are the last sausages.

01:02:43.802 --> 01:02:46.388
Farewell.

01:05:32.512 --> 01:05:35.766
We wanted you to have this razor.

01:05:36.558 --> 01:05:39.895
Thank you.
We'll continue to rehearse, right?

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:44.316
How's your leg?
It'll heal soon.

01:05:44.399 --> 01:05:47.235
He's strong, it's just a scratch.

01:05:47.319 --> 01:05:51.365
If Hannula stands in for Elo...

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:55.827
You're a maid short. How about if...

01:05:57.287 --> 01:06:01.792
Does Mr janitor want in?

01:06:05.963 --> 01:06:08.465
Hannula will be the maid.

01:06:11.593 --> 01:06:14.596
You'll be better as the father.

01:06:17.975 --> 01:06:22.187
This time we won't give up.
No.

01:06:24.648 --> 01:06:28.735
And never call me Mr janitor again.

01:06:52.592 --> 01:06:55.595
<i>Open the door!</i>

01:07:01.643 --> 01:07:05.814
<i>Good morning.
Welcome to the Kingdom of Finland.</i>

01:07:06.773 --> 01:07:10.527
Welcome to the kingdom.

01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:14.656
Ask them
if the King's got a princess?

01:07:23.415 --> 01:07:26.418
Let's go to the camp, men.

01:07:45.812 --> 01:07:48.690
They won't get far.

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:15.509
Sergeant Major's late.
Got a sore head?

01:08:16.968 --> 01:08:22.265
What went wrong? Nothing. You don't
leave your comrades like that.

01:08:22.349 --> 01:08:25.352
If you go, you go with style.

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:28.522
With your boots on,
a wig on your head.

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:34.027
The rebellion fell flat on its arse,
but we'll do one thing well.

01:08:45.372 --> 01:08:50.042
The Commandant ran away,
leaving his son to certain death.

01:08:50.127 --> 01:08:52.962
Will we call him Kalm or Hjalmar?

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:55.841
Hjalmar.

01:08:55.924 --> 01:08:59.761
<i>Gentlemen. Is Parikka here?</i>

01:09:26.203 --> 01:09:29.541
Your job is now even more
important than you can guess.

01:09:32.419 --> 01:09:36.046
You will continue to rehearse?

01:09:36.131 --> 01:09:39.426
Why do you worry about that?

01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:46.140
Commander of the Ostsee Division,
General von der Goltz

01:09:46.224 --> 01:09:50.645
will come here with
the Prison Service delegation.

01:09:50.729 --> 01:09:54.064
With Svinhufvud,
Protector of the State. I see.

01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:57.068
What do such big shots
come here for?

01:09:57.152 --> 01:10:01.907
All the prisoners able to work
will be sent to Germany.

01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:04.576
As slaves.

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:09.664
They have food.
Our situation is catastrophic.

01:10:09.748 --> 01:10:13.210
This would save the lives
of thousands of men.

01:10:19.466 --> 01:10:24.512
I give you my word.
If your play entertains the guests,

01:10:24.596 --> 01:10:29.309
you will all go to Germany.
You, too.

01:10:29.434 --> 01:10:31.436
<i>You'd get to live.</i>

01:10:40.528 --> 01:10:45.158
But if it won't make
the General laugh

01:10:45.242 --> 01:10:48.245
I'll have you shot twice.

01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:34.291
Fire!

01:11:42.757 --> 01:11:45.385
<i>General, sir.</i>

01:11:47.387 --> 01:11:49.889
Protector of the State, sir.

01:11:58.148 --> 01:12:01.860
<i>The stage will be built here.</i>

01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:12.537
<i>The prisoners are in good shape.</i>

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:16.166
<i>We'll soon see, Commandant.</i>

01:12:54.037 --> 01:12:57.832
<i>If the prisoners are healthy,
there's work to be done in Germany.</i>

01:12:57.916 --> 01:13:01.461
<i>I very much support
your plan, General!</i>

01:13:07.008 --> 01:13:11.054
Hell, no! No one can make
something like that laugh.

01:13:15.683 --> 01:13:18.853
<i>Aquila pomarina.</i>

01:13:18.937 --> 01:13:21.147
<i>Or what do you think?</i>

01:13:21.231 --> 01:13:24.234
<i>I cannot say.
It's much too high up.</i>

01:13:30.615 --> 01:13:32.492
<i>Yes!</i>

01:13:38.456 --> 01:13:41.334
THE GULF OF FINLAND WORKERS'
THEATRE: OH, YOU DEAR AUGUSTIN!

01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:48.258
Fifteen minutes.
Look what I got for you.

01:13:49.467 --> 01:13:52.762
To give you strength.

01:14:11.197 --> 01:14:13.908
I can do it.

01:14:24.544 --> 01:14:30.592
<i>Dear Count, Mr Protector
of the State. Please be seated.</i>

01:14:34.053 --> 01:14:36.848
Who are you?
From "Helsingin Sanomat".

01:14:36.931 --> 01:14:39.684
We heard that the famous Parikka
will return to the stage today.

01:14:39.767 --> 01:14:42.770
<i>Is this seat free?
Of course.</i>

01:14:49.611 --> 01:14:52.071
<i>A pillow?
No, thank you.</i>

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:57.076
Won't work. He'll bleed to death.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:01.789
We'll have to cancel.
Never done it before.

01:15:01.873 --> 01:15:05.877
If you can stand, you do the show.

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:11.090
You can desert from the front,
not from the stage.

01:15:16.596 --> 01:15:20.350
Right. We need a standin.

01:15:26.731 --> 01:15:30.318
No. No no no.
Who else?

01:15:30.401 --> 01:15:33.821
You know the lines, you speak German.
No!

01:15:33.905 --> 01:15:37.784
Put the dress on!
Or I'll tell the Commandant

01:15:37.867 --> 01:15:40.578
who stole his sausages!

01:15:41.204 --> 01:15:45.500
Get ready, everyone. Nyborg will
stand in for Aulis. Break a leg!

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:49.087
Break a leg!

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:18.908
My galoshes!

01:16:18.992 --> 01:16:24.831
Where are my galoshes?
On your feet, dear sir.

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:27.584
Remove them at once then!

01:16:27.667 --> 01:16:32.088
My dear beloved daughter Elvira
will arrive any moment now!

01:16:33.298 --> 01:16:35.300
I wonder if she has changed much?

01:16:35.383 --> 01:16:38.970
She's been studying in Germany
for so many years!

01:16:39.053 --> 01:16:41.848
That tomfoolery will end now!

01:16:41.931 --> 01:16:45.393
I have decided
that she will be married.

01:16:45.476 --> 01:16:49.439
Miss Elvira! Married!

01:16:53.526 --> 01:16:56.696
I can't remember a single line.

01:16:56.821 --> 01:17:02.368
Whom has she found?
She doesn't know it yet.

01:17:02.452 --> 01:17:06.164
It cannot be true! I shall faint!

01:17:06.247 --> 01:17:09.500
They're not laughing!
You'll be fine.

01:17:09.584 --> 01:17:13.254
One more thing. Stay there.

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:16.758
She doesn't know?
And in you go!

01:17:37.278 --> 01:17:41.199
How wonderful to be back home again.

01:17:44.911 --> 01:17:48.456
You can hardly wait to tell

01:17:48.539 --> 01:17:53.795
your father the wonderful news!

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:56.547
Right?

01:17:56.631 --> 01:17:59.759
Father will like you.

01:17:59.884 --> 01:18:02.720
Did someone speak? I can't hear.

01:18:02.804 --> 01:18:06.182
Father will like you, darling!

01:18:06.265 --> 01:18:09.936
Dear Elvira!

01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:12.230
Just go on!

01:18:16.067 --> 01:18:20.988
Father!
Elvira dearest!

01:18:23.116 --> 01:18:27.286
You are getting married!
With whom?

01:18:27.370 --> 01:18:31.082
<i>In German! Act in German!</i>

01:18:31.165 --> 01:18:34.794
<i>Please.
His name is Hans.</i>

01:18:34.919 --> 01:18:37.004
<i>No! Not a German!</i>

01:18:37.088 --> 01:18:42.677
You don't decide it.
Hans will dine with us tonight.

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:47.557
<i>No! Not a German!</i>

01:18:50.435 --> 01:18:57.692
<i>What is wrong with German men?</i>

01:19:02.864 --> 01:19:05.158
<i>Good Lord!</i>

01:19:05.241 --> 01:19:10.288
<i>It is so painful.</i>

01:19:17.253 --> 01:19:22.675
<i>Even larger than a Russian's?</i>

01:19:25.094 --> 01:19:27.305
<i>What about the officers?</i>

01:19:27.388 --> 01:19:31.976
<i>Do they have larger ones
than the seamen?</i>

01:19:32.059 --> 01:19:35.104
<i>No! Of course not!</i>

01:19:40.735 --> 01:19:46.699
<i>In that case, does the Kaiser
have the smallest one?</i>

01:19:47.784 --> 01:19:52.580
<i>Of course not!
Who, then?</i>

01:19:54.457 --> 01:19:58.127
<i>The Frenchmen.</i>

01:19:58.211 --> 01:20:02.340
<i>The Frenchmen</i>

01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:07.345
<i>have the smallest ones!</i>

01:20:12.683 --> 01:20:16.687
Stop! Stop the play!

01:20:18.481 --> 01:20:22.735
This is outrageous!
You should be ashamed.

01:20:41.254 --> 01:20:43.756
You know quite well...

01:20:45.049 --> 01:20:47.343
You're now...

01:21:27.508 --> 01:21:33.306
Continue!
I want to know how it will end.

01:21:36.767 --> 01:21:42.356
You want to know a secret?
I already have a fiancée.

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:45.735
Don't tell my father.

01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:53.117
I'll teach you
to defy your father's will!

01:21:57.705 --> 01:22:02.126
<i>I am Väinö I, King of Finland!</i>

01:22:02.209 --> 01:22:07.840
<i>My real name is Friedrich Karl Ludwig
Konstantin von HessenKassel.</i>

01:22:07.924 --> 01:22:10.760
<i>The Kaiser's brotherinlaw.</i>

01:22:19.769 --> 01:22:21.771
<i>My King!</i>

01:22:21.854 --> 01:22:24.398
Excuse me, but King of Sweden

01:22:24.482 --> 01:22:26.901
forgot to make my greatgreat
greatgrandfather a knight.

01:22:26.984 --> 01:22:30.947
Could you make me a knight?

01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:34.659
<i>Out of question.
Ask my bottom ha“.</i>

01:22:34.742 --> 01:22:37.286
Mr Bottomhalf!

01:22:38.913 --> 01:22:41.958
<i>Would you make me a knight?</i>

01:22:42.833 --> 01:22:45.336
No way! No way!

01:22:47.171 --> 01:22:53.177
I am a war hero.
Hjalmar! Come home immediately!

01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:58.474
Forgive us, sire.
Hjalmar has not slept enough.

01:22:58.557 --> 01:23:02.770
He had a nightmare about
the Battle of Tampere again.

01:23:02.853 --> 01:23:07.692
Tampere, Tampere, Tampere!
Always about Tampere!

01:23:07.775 --> 01:23:12.863
He fled from his post, having ordered
his platoon into a certain death.

01:23:12.947 --> 01:23:15.116
That's why he was transferred here

01:23:15.241 --> 01:23:18.995
where it's easier to kill your enemy.

01:23:31.632 --> 01:23:35.386
<i>Lullaby and goodnight,</i>

01:23:35.469 --> 01:23:39.015
<i>Thy mother's delight</i>

01:23:39.098 --> 01:23:45.563
<i>Bright angels beside
My darling abide</i>

01:23:45.646 --> 01:23:52.653
<i>They will guard thee at rest</i>

01:23:52.737 --> 01:24:00.161
<i>Thou shalt wake at by breast</i>

01:24:00.286 --> 01:24:03.581
<i>Lullaby and goodnight</i>

01:24:03.664 --> 01:24:07.501
<i>With roses bedight</i>

01:24:07.585 --> 01:24:11.005
<i>With lilies o'er spread</i>

01:24:11.088 --> 01:24:14.925
<i>Is baby's wee bed</i>

01:24:15.009 --> 01:24:18.721
<i>Lay thee down now and rest</i>

01:24:18.804 --> 01:24:23.184
<i>May thy slumber be blessed</i>

01:24:58.094 --> 01:25:01.388
Goddamn you, Nyborg!

01:25:04.141 --> 01:25:06.519
I made them laugh!

01:25:09.522 --> 01:25:11.607
<i>Enjoy your meal.</i>

01:25:23.661 --> 01:25:26.997
<i>They were quite wonderful.</i>

01:25:31.877 --> 01:25:36.006
<i>Did you know that they were
acting to save their lives?</i>

01:25:36.090 --> 01:25:41.512
<i>Hjalmar promised to spare their lives
if they'd succeed in entertaining us.</i>

01:25:41.595 --> 01:25:44.014
<i>They are dangerous rebels.</i>

01:25:44.098 --> 01:25:47.852
<i>They were just treating
the wounded at their theatre.</i>

01:25:47.935 --> 01:25:50.771
<i>Parikka at least has
committed several murders.</i>

01:25:50.855 --> 01:25:54.233
<i>Really? He didn't look like
a murderer to me.</i>

01:25:54.358 --> 01:25:56.652
<i>Appearances are deceiving.</i>

01:25:58.529 --> 01:26:02.449
<i>General. Please pardon them.</i>

01:26:12.918 --> 01:26:15.087
<i>Winge</i>

01:26:15.171 --> 01:26:18.507
<i>See that they at least get beer.</i>

01:26:18.924 --> 01:26:22.469
Mr Protector of the State,
could you pardon them?

01:26:22.553 --> 01:26:25.681
I don't have that kind of
authority here.

01:26:25.764 --> 01:26:29.768
Perhaps the Commandant can do it?

01:26:40.946 --> 01:26:44.074
<i>Of course we will pardon them.</i>

01:26:44.158 --> 01:26:47.536
<i>Well, then. Your health.</i>

01:27:06.764 --> 01:27:10.559
Who's the funniest man
in Finland now?

01:27:10.643 --> 01:27:15.231
Damn you, Nyborg. You know.

01:27:15.314 --> 01:27:18.192
This man taught me to act.

01:27:18.275 --> 01:27:23.948
He said: "just breathe
and focus on the others."

01:27:26.825 --> 01:27:29.954
It's the same in life.

01:27:30.037 --> 01:27:33.999
You focus on the others.
The rest comes by itself.

01:27:37.836 --> 01:27:41.340
<i>Are these empty?
Yes, General.</i>

01:28:02.945 --> 01:28:10.619
<i>We'll begin preparations for the
transfer of the prisoners to Germany.</i>

01:28:10.703 --> 01:28:12.913
<i>No need to hurry.</i>

01:28:14.873 --> 01:28:16.875
<i>Excuse me?</i>

01:28:18.502 --> 01:28:23.549
<i>We are running out of grain, too.
People are starving.</i>

01:28:26.677 --> 01:28:30.931
<i>The troops will not withstand
even a smallest setback.</i>

01:28:31.015 --> 01:28:37.062
<i>We have complete faith in Germany.
Or we wouldn't ask you for a king.</i>

01:28:40.691 --> 01:28:44.111
<i>Surely Germany cannot lose?</i>

01:28:44.194 --> 01:28:48.907
<i>Kaiser has other worries besides
your dreams of a king. Commandant.</i>

01:29:31.283 --> 01:29:34.870
You really don't know how
to laugh at yourself.

01:29:34.953 --> 01:29:40.292
I have done my utmost
to make you enjoy yourself here.

01:29:42.628 --> 01:29:46.382
That you'd again be
the person I once knew.

01:29:46.465 --> 01:29:50.469
What was I like?

01:29:53.347 --> 01:29:55.641
Tell me.

01:30:04.066 --> 01:30:07.319
I will go on the General's ship
to Helsinki.

01:30:13.659 --> 01:30:16.703
Did you really think I'd pardon
that devil's spawn?

01:30:16.787 --> 01:30:20.124
I'll have him shot the moment
the General's ship has cast off!

01:30:29.842 --> 01:30:33.095
Why didn't you come to the sauna?

01:30:41.687 --> 01:30:44.898
Where's Parikka?
Guards!

01:30:46.650 --> 01:30:49.695
What the hell?

01:30:49.778 --> 01:30:54.199
Get dressed! Move the prisoners
to the camp immediately!

01:30:54.825 --> 01:30:57.578
Move! Nyborg!

01:30:57.703 --> 01:30:59.997
Captain, sir.

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:03.584
Where's Parikka?
I don't know, sir.

01:31:03.709 --> 01:31:06.253
Find him.

01:32:02.017 --> 01:32:04.561
<i>Where is my uniform?</i>

01:32:26.333 --> 01:32:29.586
Toby Belch!

01:32:29.670 --> 01:32:34.841
<i>Toby Belch!
People are looking for you.</i>

01:33:00.576 --> 01:33:03.161
<i>Good evening.</i>

01:33:06.665 --> 01:33:10.043
<i>Have we met?</i>

01:33:10.127 --> 01:33:14.923
<i>I doubt it.
Where are you going? If I may ask.</i>

01:33:16.216 --> 01:33:19.886
<i>None of your business, Lieutenant.</i>

01:33:26.476 --> 01:33:28.979
<i>Better that way.</i>

01:33:29.062 --> 01:33:32.065
<i>How do you know what's better for me?</i>

01:33:52.002 --> 01:33:54.421
<i>There.</i>

01:34:38.632 --> 01:34:43.011
Dear friends. Welcome to the theatre!

01:34:58.443 --> 01:35:01.446
You know, Parikka.

01:35:03.615 --> 01:35:06.743
You're not even
an especially good actor.

01:35:09.287 --> 01:35:12.833
Stand arms!

01:35:17.129 --> 01:35:19.756
Load!

01:35:21.925 --> 01:35:24.636
Aim!
Don't!

01:35:26.596 --> 01:35:28.682
Nyborg, dismissed.

01:35:33.478 --> 01:35:37.023
I won't leave, Captain sir.

01:35:38.608 --> 01:35:43.697
Well. Then you join the firing squad.

01:35:45.824 --> 01:35:48.827
Fall in, now.

01:36:05.343 --> 01:36:08.388
Have you gone insane?

01:36:10.599 --> 01:36:14.060
What are you doing there?

01:36:14.144 --> 01:36:16.897
You have to shoot me, too.

01:36:18.106 --> 01:36:20.776
I am the sausage thief.

01:36:23.779 --> 01:36:26.031
Aim!

01:36:35.874 --> 01:36:38.585
Fire!

01:36:43.548 --> 01:36:47.052
Must I do everything myself?

01:36:49.554 --> 01:36:51.431
Stand aside!

01:36:56.061 --> 01:37:00.732
Stay in the line!
Stay in the line! That's an order!

01:37:06.863 --> 01:37:09.491
Aim!

01:37:09.574 --> 01:37:12.536
Quiet!

01:37:12.619 --> 01:37:15.121
Aim!

01:37:49.573 --> 01:37:52.951
Based on true events.

01:37:57.372 --> 01:38:01.418
The project to install a king was
abandoned when Germany lost the war.

01:38:01.501 --> 01:38:05.630
Finland became a republic again.

01:38:05.714 --> 01:38:12.679
Approx. 20,000 Red prisoners died
and were shot in the prison camps.
