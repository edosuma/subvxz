00:03.655 --> 00:04.004
.

00:04.047 --> 00:07.485
- I found a clinical trial.

00:07.529 --> 00:10.140
Precision-targeted
immunotherapy.

00:10.184 --> 00:13.056
It's led by Dr. Panthaki
at St. Simon's.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.666
He's highly regarded.

00:14.710 --> 00:17.582
And, unlike radiation
and chemo,

00:17.626 --> 00:22.152
it comes with no debilitating
side effects.

00:22.196 --> 00:24.154
- That sounds perfect.

00:24.198 --> 00:25.329
- It's exactly what he wanted.

00:25.373 --> 00:27.723
- All right.
Dr. Sharpe gets it done.

00:27.766 --> 00:30.247
- Which is the difference
between me and this trial.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.162
Because precision therapy
might not work.

00:32.206 --> 00:34.556
- Your objection is noted.
Again.

00:34.599 --> 00:37.167
- Yes, radiation chemotherapy
is challenging,

00:37.211 --> 00:38.777
but it's--
- It's brutal.

00:38.821 --> 00:41.215
It's--It's hitting yourself with
a brick over and over again

00:41.258 --> 00:42.564
and hoping the cancer
dies first.

00:42.607 --> 00:44.044
- That's the point.

00:44.087 --> 00:46.133
The cancer dies.

00:46.176 --> 00:48.352
Radiation
and chemotherapy work.

00:48.396 --> 00:50.267
Precision therapy is like
gambling your life

00:50.311 --> 00:52.052
on a lottery ticket.

00:52.095 --> 00:54.141
- People said the same thing
about bone marrow transplants.

00:54.184 --> 00:55.794
- They also say it
about lottery tickets.

00:55.838 --> 00:58.058
- Enough.

01:00.886 --> 01:05.065
Is this what you really want?

01:10.418 --> 01:11.636
- She's right.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.074
Chemo and radiation,
they work.

01:14.117 --> 01:16.293
They do the job.

01:16.337 --> 01:19.731
But...they'll break me.

01:19.775 --> 01:21.429
No matter how strong I am.

01:21.472 --> 01:24.127
I'll lose my hearing.

01:24.171 --> 01:26.825
My sight.

01:26.869 --> 01:29.437
I'll lose my mind.

01:29.480 --> 01:32.614
They don't always come back.

01:32.657 --> 01:36.270
And I have so many things...

01:36.313 --> 01:41.188
that I need to do.

01:41.231 --> 01:44.365
- So let's get in the trial.

01:48.586 --> 01:51.372
- So let's get in the trial.

01:54.418 --> 01:57.247
[alarm blaring]

02:02.644 --> 02:04.254
- Uh, so?

02:04.298 --> 02:06.126
- What? Oh, sorry,
I didn't see you there.

02:06.169 --> 02:07.127
- You know what, an email
would have covered it,

02:07.170 --> 02:08.128
maybe even a text.

02:08.171 --> 02:09.433
But now we're here in person

02:09.477 --> 02:11.218
you should definitely
be groveling.

02:11.261 --> 02:12.393
Evie and I were up all night.

02:12.436 --> 02:13.394
- You stallion.

02:13.437 --> 02:14.612
- Fighting.

02:14.656 --> 02:15.831
Look, I'm not trying
to be a jerk here,

02:15.874 --> 02:17.267
but telling Evie
that we used to--

02:17.311 --> 02:18.834
- I know.
- It wasn't cool.

02:18.877 --> 02:20.531
- I said I know.

02:20.575 --> 02:23.795
- What you should be saying
is, "I am sorry."

02:23.839 --> 02:26.276
- I am. I'm sorry.

02:26.320 --> 02:29.192
- You don't sound sorry.

02:29.236 --> 02:31.281
- Look, can we just not
have this be a thing, okay?

02:31.325 --> 02:32.413
- You know what,
you're the one who said

02:32.456 --> 02:33.805
that we can be friends.

02:33.849 --> 02:36.330
This doesn't feel like friends.
- [sighs]

02:36.373 --> 02:38.462
[sirens wailing]

02:38.506 --> 02:40.856
- Early morning rush
started early.

02:40.899 --> 02:43.641
[sirens wailing]

02:43.685 --> 02:45.208
- You got some nerve.

02:45.252 --> 02:47.428
- It's French vanilla.

02:47.471 --> 02:48.733
- Like hell it is.

02:48.777 --> 02:50.561
- Eh, maybe hazelnut?

02:50.605 --> 02:52.346
- You're mothering me
or babying me.

02:52.389 --> 02:54.174
Whichever one it is, stop it.

02:54.217 --> 02:55.175
- Are you okay?

02:55.218 --> 02:56.176
- You're doing it again.

02:56.219 --> 02:57.220
What do we got?

02:57.264 --> 02:58.395
- This is LaDavius Powell.

02:58.439 --> 03:00.223
45-year-old man with new onset

03:00.267 --> 03:02.356
right-side abdominal pain.

03:02.399 --> 03:04.227
No meds, no past
medical history,

03:04.271 --> 03:05.576
allergic to Cephilicam.

03:05.620 --> 03:07.274
- Cephilicam?
- Fancy penicillin.

03:07.317 --> 03:09.276
Bay 23, step lively.
- Cephilicam.

03:09.319 --> 03:10.668
- Sarah Madsen.

03:10.712 --> 03:12.627
36-year-old woman found
down on the sidewalk.

03:12.670 --> 03:14.194
Unresponsive, hypotensive.

03:14.237 --> 03:16.239
BP 90 over palp,
heart rate 120.

03:16.283 --> 03:17.675
Said New Amsterdam
was her hospital.

03:17.719 --> 03:19.242
- Okay, looks like
previous heart surgery.

03:19.286 --> 03:20.243
Find her medical records.

03:20.287 --> 03:21.505
- Drew this in the field.

03:21.549 --> 03:22.637
- Why is the blood so diluted?

03:22.680 --> 03:23.855
- No idea. No sign of bleeding.

03:23.899 --> 03:24.856
- The blood's gotta be
going somewhere.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.510
Page Dr. Sharpe.

03:26.554 --> 03:28.295
We gotta get on this
or she's not gonna make it.

03:28.338 --> 03:29.731
- Maximus, today
is one of those days

03:29.774 --> 03:31.515
that makes it all worth it,
you know?

03:31.559 --> 03:32.690
It's one of those days
you jump out of bed excited

03:32.734 --> 03:33.996
because you just know...

03:34.039 --> 03:35.345
- It's gonna be
one of those days.

03:35.389 --> 03:36.738
- Yes! Yes, in a big,
big way.

03:36.781 --> 03:37.739
Are you feeling it too?

03:37.782 --> 03:39.306
- I am feeling it.

03:39.349 --> 03:40.698
I got a meeting
with the nurses' union

03:40.742 --> 03:41.830
about insurance
and birth control.

03:41.873 --> 03:43.310
- Eh, so not so much.

03:43.353 --> 03:44.702
- Nah, it'll be good.
What do you got?

03:44.746 --> 03:46.226
- Me, I have
a transitioning teen

03:46.269 --> 03:47.531
coming in with his parents.

03:47.575 --> 03:49.011
And you know,
society is not kind

03:49.054 --> 03:50.491
to trans teens.

03:50.534 --> 03:52.710
Bullying, cultural stigma,
hate crimes,

03:52.754 --> 03:54.277
which all leads to depression,

03:54.321 --> 03:55.670
which way too often
leads to suicide--

03:55.713 --> 03:57.237
- Sorry, this is
your happy day?

03:57.280 --> 03:58.542
- No, no, my happy day
is what happens

03:58.586 --> 04:00.457
when these kids
get to feel heard.

04:00.501 --> 04:02.633
Today I get to help somebody
find out who they are.

04:02.677 --> 04:04.374
I get to help somebody
find their voice.

04:04.418 --> 04:06.289
- Happy day indeed.
- Indeed.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.900
- Yeah, so I'm good
with the whole voice thing,

04:08.944 --> 04:10.641
like, got it, found it.

04:10.685 --> 04:11.990
Fine with it.
I've got...

04:12.034 --> 04:14.297
other issues here.

04:14.341 --> 04:16.038
- Oh.

04:16.081 --> 04:17.431
Okay.

04:17.474 --> 04:19.955
Uh, what are they?

04:19.998 --> 04:22.305
- Exhibit those.

04:22.349 --> 04:23.393
Parents.

04:23.437 --> 04:24.525
- All right.

04:24.568 --> 04:25.917
Jillian, Grant?

04:25.961 --> 04:27.963
Care to elaborate?

04:29.530 --> 04:32.750
- Well, Dr. Frome,
Shay says he's ready

04:32.794 --> 04:34.404
for top surgery.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.276
But we--
- But they won't let me get it.

04:36.319 --> 04:37.668
I mean, how's that
for withholding?

04:37.712 --> 04:39.888
- Shay, that's not fair.
- We have concerns.

04:39.931 --> 04:41.933
- See, Doc?

04:41.977 --> 04:42.978
Issues.

04:43.021 --> 04:44.762
I mean...

04:44.806 --> 04:46.416
help me out here.

04:46.460 --> 04:49.419
[lively percussion music]

04:49.463 --> 04:51.378
â™ª

04:51.421 --> 04:52.814
- [knocking]

04:52.857 --> 04:54.598
- We could do a sit-in.
At shift change.

04:54.642 --> 04:55.773
- Bigger.
- Picket HCC's office.

04:55.817 --> 04:57.340
- Bigger.

04:57.384 --> 04:58.428
You want to keep
your birth control coverage?

04:58.472 --> 04:59.429
Then kick 'em where it hurts.

04:59.473 --> 05:00.735
- Excuse me, Max,

05:00.778 --> 05:01.736
can I have a word please?
- All right.

05:01.779 --> 05:03.085
Keep thinking.

05:03.128 --> 05:05.827
Kick some ass
for the working class!

05:05.870 --> 05:08.438
Did you hear from Dr. Panthaki?

05:08.482 --> 05:10.048
- No, this isn't
about the trial.

05:10.092 --> 05:13.400
Dr. Bloom asked me to consult
on a hematology patient.

05:13.443 --> 05:15.532
Turns out that she was
a heart transplant recipient

05:15.576 --> 05:17.447
here, 27 years ago.

05:17.491 --> 05:19.754
- And?

05:19.797 --> 05:22.452
- Her file says that she
received her heart

05:22.496 --> 05:26.326
from a "Luna Goodwin."

05:26.369 --> 05:29.067
Your sister.

05:33.289 --> 05:33.420
.

05:33.463 --> 05:35.857
- She's fading fast.

05:35.900 --> 05:37.424
We've already infused two units
of packed red cells

05:37.467 --> 05:38.860
with a pressure bag
but she's still net negative.

05:38.903 --> 05:40.296
I would give her
a plasma expander,

05:40.340 --> 05:42.037
but her hematocrit's
already in the toilet.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.778
I mean, that's just gonna
make it crash even more.

05:43.821 --> 05:45.127
The usual production-
destruction algorithm

05:45.170 --> 05:46.911
doesn't seem to apply to her.

05:46.955 --> 05:48.913
- Let's order up two more units
from the blood bank

05:48.957 --> 05:50.393
and let's get a second
large bore IV line.

05:50.437 --> 05:51.873
Give me a little Trendelenburg.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.396
- How can I help?

05:53.440 --> 05:54.397
- That's where all the blood
is going.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.051
Sarah's right thigh.

05:56.094 --> 05:57.139
- Why is she bleeding
in the first place?

05:57.182 --> 05:58.183
- There's no localized source.

05:58.227 --> 05:59.184
- No cuts, lacerations,

05:59.228 --> 06:00.185
blown arterial aneurysm?

06:00.229 --> 06:01.186
- No, every organ just

06:01.230 --> 06:02.187
seems to be oozing blood.

06:02.231 --> 06:03.406
- Elevated PTT?

06:03.450 --> 06:04.494
- It's barely out
of the normal range.

06:04.538 --> 06:05.887
- Yeah, but put that together

06:05.930 --> 06:06.888
with why she's bleeding
so much.

06:06.931 --> 06:08.368
- Um, acquired hemophilia?

06:08.411 --> 06:09.412
- Her clotting factor eight
isn't working.

06:09.456 --> 06:10.500
That's why she's bleeding.

06:10.544 --> 06:12.023
- Rare, but it would
explain it.

06:12.067 --> 06:13.068
- That's good.

06:13.111 --> 06:14.069
I'm really thirsty.

06:14.112 --> 06:15.462
- Uh, uh, uh...

06:15.505 --> 06:16.898
She's thirsty. Can we
get her some water, nurse?

06:16.941 --> 06:18.116
- Uh, let's hold off on that.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.248
- Uh, Ms. Madsen, I--

06:19.291 --> 06:21.076
- I had a heart transplant.

06:21.119 --> 06:22.382
At my last check-up
my doctor said

06:22.425 --> 06:24.079
that my cyclosporin levels
were low

06:24.122 --> 06:25.341
and I've been worried that
my body's rejecting my heart.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.908
Could that be causing this?

06:26.951 --> 06:28.257
- That wouldn't explain
the bleeding.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.389
But it might explain
why the bleeding's

06:29.432 --> 06:30.390
been making you so sick.

06:30.433 --> 06:31.826
- How sick am I?

06:31.869 --> 06:32.827
- I'm afraid
acquired hemophilia

06:32.870 --> 06:33.958
is quite serious.

06:34.002 --> 06:35.438
- But we're gonna fix it, okay?

06:35.482 --> 06:37.484
Uh, nurses are gonna
take you up to ICU right now.

06:37.527 --> 06:39.094
We're gonna start treatment
and you're gonna do great.

06:39.137 --> 06:41.313
- Thank you.

06:41.357 --> 06:43.751
- Are you okay?

06:43.794 --> 06:45.317
- Uh, once the bleeding
is stabilized

06:45.361 --> 06:46.928
get me a transvenous
heart biopsy.

06:46.971 --> 06:48.886
Tell me everything you can
about that heart.

06:48.930 --> 06:51.193
- Max.

06:56.503 --> 06:58.766
- You type so fast!

06:58.809 --> 07:01.551
Like Matthew Broderick
in "WarGames."

07:01.595 --> 07:05.337
- No idea who or what that is.

07:05.381 --> 07:07.949
Boom. Now you're on Twitter.

07:07.992 --> 07:11.387
See? That's me right there.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.824
- @ShayMyName2018?

07:13.868 --> 07:15.435
- Yeah. Silly name, I know.

07:15.478 --> 07:18.133
- You have 27,000 followers?

07:18.176 --> 07:20.004
- Yeah. Crazy, right?

07:20.048 --> 07:21.353
They've been following me
since the beginning

07:21.397 --> 07:22.572
of my transition.

07:22.616 --> 07:24.269
It's a--it's a real community.

07:24.313 --> 07:25.445
They support me.

07:25.488 --> 07:27.055
Keep me real.
- I had no idea.

07:27.098 --> 07:28.099
- Yeah, they can't wait for me

07:28.143 --> 07:29.318
to get top surgery.

07:29.361 --> 07:31.059
Now we're just waiting
for Dr. Frome

07:31.102 --> 07:33.844
to, you know, do his thing.

07:35.411 --> 07:36.586
- You don't understand.

07:36.630 --> 07:38.109
We love Shay.

07:38.153 --> 07:39.459
We have been supportive
of his transition

07:39.502 --> 07:40.851
from the beginning.

07:40.895 --> 07:42.505
- The new haircut,
the new clothes.

07:42.549 --> 07:44.246
Even the hormone blockers.

07:44.289 --> 07:46.074
We never pushed back, not once.

07:46.117 --> 07:48.511
- But surgery?
It's so permanent.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.121
- Well, you know, um...

07:50.165 --> 07:52.341
Top surgery is the most common

07:52.384 --> 07:55.083
gender-confirmation surgery
for trans men.

07:55.126 --> 07:57.520
Having a body that doesn't
reflect your gender...

07:57.564 --> 07:59.348
[clears throat]
That can be deeply unsettling.

07:59.391 --> 08:01.002
- Of course. We know.

08:01.045 --> 08:03.613
It's just--
- Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

08:03.657 --> 08:06.355
He's not even old enough
to drive a car.

08:06.398 --> 08:09.227
He's not old enough to get
into R-rated movies,

08:09.271 --> 08:11.360
and he's not old enough
to decide on his own

08:11.403 --> 08:13.580
to get permanent surgery.

08:13.623 --> 08:14.624
- It's okay, it's okay.

08:14.668 --> 08:15.973
This is exactly where we can

08:16.017 --> 08:17.148
talk about all of this.

08:17.192 --> 08:18.236
So why don't you guys tell me

08:18.280 --> 08:19.237
a little bit about Shay

08:19.281 --> 08:22.458
before he came out?

08:22.502 --> 08:23.981
- It was hard.

08:24.025 --> 08:26.549
He was anxious all the time.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.551
Sometimes he had trouble
getting out of bed.

08:28.595 --> 08:32.120
- What about after he started
to socially transition?

08:32.163 --> 08:34.122
- He started smiling.

08:34.165 --> 08:35.950
Making friends.

08:35.993 --> 08:37.517
And when he started
the hormone blockers

08:37.560 --> 08:39.519
he said he felt like himself
for the first time.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.259
- Yeah.

08:44.219 --> 08:48.223
- My baby was 14 and he had
never felt like himself.

08:48.266 --> 08:52.140
- And we're grateful he does.

08:52.183 --> 08:54.098
But when we said no to surgery,

08:54.142 --> 08:55.230
you know what he did?

08:55.273 --> 08:57.449
He threw a GoFundMe on Twitter

08:57.493 --> 08:59.451
to ask his followers
to pay for it.

08:59.495 --> 09:00.540
And they did.

09:00.583 --> 09:02.237
- We're proud that he is a voice

09:02.280 --> 09:04.587
for a community.

09:04.631 --> 09:06.676
But he's just a kid.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.504
Our kid.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.550
Please tell him
he can't do this.

09:10.593 --> 09:14.336
- All right, I-I understand
that you are overwhelmed.

09:14.379 --> 09:17.948
But the positive changes
in Shay since transitioning

09:17.992 --> 09:19.907
are undeniable.

09:19.950 --> 09:22.126
And emotionally?

09:22.170 --> 09:24.955
I gotta say, I think the
emotions that matter most here

09:24.999 --> 09:27.218
are his. So...

09:27.262 --> 09:29.699
I am going to approve
a medical evaluation

09:29.743 --> 09:31.135
for surgery.

09:41.232 --> 09:43.278
- My son has been sober
for a year.

09:43.321 --> 09:45.280
- Oh, that's terrific.

09:45.323 --> 09:47.238
- He has shown great strength.

09:47.282 --> 09:49.458
More than I knew he had.

09:49.501 --> 09:51.155
I should have had more faith.

09:51.199 --> 09:52.200
- It's never too late.

09:52.243 --> 09:53.201
Peanuts?

09:53.244 --> 09:54.594
- Barbecue or Tangy Fiesta?

09:54.637 --> 09:57.292
- Tangy Fiesta.

09:57.335 --> 09:59.686
- I would like to give Rohan
a gift.

09:59.729 --> 10:01.731
Show my support.
- Yeah.

10:01.775 --> 10:03.603
- But recently my gifts
have been

10:03.646 --> 10:05.126
completely misunderstood.

10:05.169 --> 10:06.431
- [chuckles] I hear that.

10:06.475 --> 10:08.564
And families see agendas
in everything.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.131
What you thinking?

10:10.174 --> 10:12.002
- An apartment.

10:12.046 --> 10:14.396
Just a small one.
Nothing too fancy.

10:14.439 --> 10:16.659
- Yeah, you wouldn't want to
spoil him with a fancy one.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.139
- [chuckles]

10:18.182 --> 10:20.358
I have been a doctor
for the last 40 years.

10:20.402 --> 10:24.493
I've had more money
than I know what to do with.

10:24.536 --> 10:26.190
- It's a beautiful idea.

10:26.234 --> 10:28.062
Use your money to help
someone you care about.

10:28.105 --> 10:31.674
What else is it for, right?

10:31.718 --> 10:34.677
[soft music]

10:34.721 --> 10:41.031
â™ª

10:41.075 --> 10:42.032
- Hey.

10:42.076 --> 10:44.165
- Hey. Thanks for coming.

10:44.208 --> 10:45.645
- Is that her?
- Mm-hmm.

10:45.688 --> 10:47.124
She had the transplant here.

10:47.168 --> 10:49.518
She's been coming back
ever since.

10:49.561 --> 10:50.737
[chuckles]

10:50.780 --> 10:53.087
I didn't even know...

10:53.130 --> 10:54.697
Luna was an organ donor.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.699
- It probably wasn't
the easiest thing

10:56.743 --> 11:00.094
for your parents to talk about.

11:00.137 --> 11:04.185
- My parents didn't even
take me to the funeral.

11:04.228 --> 11:06.709
They just kinda shut the door.

11:06.753 --> 11:10.800
â™ª

11:10.844 --> 11:13.150
- Hey.

11:13.194 --> 11:15.370
Have you told her who you are?

11:15.413 --> 11:17.372
- No, she has enough
on her mind.

11:17.415 --> 11:19.374
It's not about me.

11:19.417 --> 11:22.203
- Isn't it?

11:22.246 --> 11:24.727
- Luna's heart...

11:24.771 --> 11:26.642
is beating.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.470
Right over there.

11:28.513 --> 11:30.254
And the amazing thing is,

11:30.298 --> 11:33.649
she gets another chance.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.259
30 years ago, the doctors here

11:35.303 --> 11:39.394
let Luna's heart stop.

11:39.437 --> 11:42.527
Not this time.

11:50.274 --> 11:52.755
- Hey. Uh, Evie.

11:52.799 --> 11:54.757
Sorry to bother you.

11:54.801 --> 11:58.065
- Slogging through the...

11:58.108 --> 11:59.762
madness of malpractice claims.

11:59.806 --> 12:02.243
- Oh. Not my department,
I hope.

12:02.286 --> 12:04.114
I always hide the bodies
when I'm done.

12:06.290 --> 12:09.554
I--that was not even
a little bit funny.

12:09.598 --> 12:12.601
Okay, uh, listen.

12:12.644 --> 12:14.777
The other day
when I mentioned that

12:14.821 --> 12:16.561
Reynolds and I, we...

12:16.605 --> 12:18.346
we kinda had this, uh,

12:18.389 --> 12:20.783
fling?

12:20.827 --> 12:22.567
That was, uh,
that was bad form.

12:22.611 --> 12:23.786
To bring that up.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.788
I mean, I totally
betrayed the...

12:25.832 --> 12:27.616
sisterhood of...

12:27.659 --> 12:28.835
sisters.

12:28.878 --> 12:30.750
Or whatever.

12:30.793 --> 12:33.274
I think you and Reynolds
are perfect for each other.

12:33.317 --> 12:35.667
I mean that's--that's why I
introduced the two of you, so.

12:35.711 --> 12:36.712
- Let me bail you out here.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.235
- Oh, great, please hurry.

12:38.279 --> 12:40.585
- I know Floyd had a life
before me.

12:40.629 --> 12:41.891
I'm glad he did.

12:41.935 --> 12:44.285
I just need to know
if you two are over.

12:44.328 --> 12:46.113
- Oh. Oh, we're over.

12:46.156 --> 12:48.419
We are the very definition
of over.

12:48.463 --> 12:50.378
- I like Floyd.

12:50.421 --> 12:53.381
But I've made bad bets before.

12:53.424 --> 12:55.731
So if you really are
a card-carrying member

12:55.775 --> 12:58.429
of the sisterhood of sisters,

12:58.473 --> 13:01.389
you won't let me do it again.

13:01.432 --> 13:05.436
Because I do not have time.

13:05.480 --> 13:09.266
So are you and Floyd done?

13:09.310 --> 13:10.833
- Evie.

13:10.877 --> 13:13.270
It is not something
that you have to worry about.

13:13.314 --> 13:14.663
Okay?

13:14.706 --> 13:17.622
- Then I won't.

13:17.666 --> 13:20.190
- Okay.

13:21.888 --> 13:24.847
[soft music]

13:24.891 --> 13:31.854
â™ª

13:35.989 --> 13:37.860
- That looks fun.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.862
- This, uh, infusion

13:39.906 --> 13:42.473
replaces the clotting factor
that your body is destroying.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.736
- So you can just replace it?
It's that simple?

13:44.780 --> 13:47.522
- Unfortunately,
it's not simple at all.

13:47.565 --> 13:48.958
- Uh, but it's very doable.

13:49.002 --> 13:52.309
It's been done successfully
many times.

13:52.353 --> 13:53.963
- We need to infuse the factor

13:54.007 --> 13:55.704
at the exact same rate that
your body is destroying it,

13:55.747 --> 13:57.749
which is an incredibly
difficult rate to find.

13:57.793 --> 14:00.578
- But again, doable.

14:00.622 --> 14:03.277
- Too much factor
and your blood will clot.

14:03.320 --> 14:04.539
You could suffer a stroke.

14:04.582 --> 14:05.975
Or a heart attack.

14:06.019 --> 14:07.890
Too little and you could
start to bleed again.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.544
- Which we won't let happen.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.938
I'll be doing a blood test
called the PTT.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.896
I'll be drawing it
from the central line

14:13.940 --> 14:15.463
every 20 minutes,
and then based on

14:15.506 --> 14:17.944
the results, I will adjust
the rate of infusion.

14:17.987 --> 14:19.510
- Will that take a long time?

14:19.554 --> 14:23.558
- Yes, it will.
- Uh, hopefully not.

14:23.601 --> 14:26.735
- It's not something that
we can definitively know.

14:26.778 --> 14:29.607
- Yeah, but however long
it may take,

14:29.651 --> 14:31.958
I will be here by your side

14:32.001 --> 14:33.829
night and day

14:33.873 --> 14:35.570
till we get it right.

14:35.613 --> 14:36.919
- Why me?

14:36.963 --> 14:38.399
- Excuse me?

14:38.442 --> 14:40.662
- Well, um, you're
the Medical Director

14:40.705 --> 14:42.533
of the entire hospital.

14:42.577 --> 14:45.797
You're dropping everything
for me, Dr., um...

14:45.841 --> 14:49.279
- Uh, Goodwin. Max.

14:49.323 --> 14:51.586
Um...

14:51.629 --> 14:53.588
Just an interesting case.

14:53.631 --> 14:54.981
- Dr. Goodwin, Dr. Sharpe.

14:55.024 --> 14:56.504
Could I have a minute?

14:56.547 --> 14:58.941
- Excuse us.

15:02.684 --> 15:04.599
- I, uh, I got the results

15:04.642 --> 15:06.427
from Sarah's heart biopsy.

15:06.470 --> 15:08.255
The heart muscle showed
both fibrosis

15:08.298 --> 15:10.300
and T-lymphocyte infiltration.

15:10.344 --> 15:11.823
It's Grade 4.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.477
- Well, it doesn't
get much worse.

15:13.521 --> 15:15.523
- Okay, so we up
the cyclosporin dose.

15:15.566 --> 15:16.524
- Why would we--
- If we up the dose

15:16.567 --> 15:17.786
and we add pulse steroids.

15:17.829 --> 15:18.874
And we look for an
anti T-cell agent--

15:18.918 --> 15:20.397
- That's out of the question.

15:20.441 --> 15:21.964
Look, the stress
from Sarah's hemophilia

15:22.008 --> 15:22.965
has ravaged her heart.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.401
- So un-ravage it.

15:24.445 --> 15:25.750
I gave you a whole
cardio department.

15:25.794 --> 15:26.969
Use it, because we sure as hell

15:27.013 --> 15:28.579
aren't going to just sit here--

15:28.623 --> 15:31.060
- Max.
- What?

15:31.104 --> 15:36.022
- Luna's heart is dying.

15:36.065 --> 15:39.068
It's gone.

15:39.112 --> 15:42.811
- That's my sister's heart.

15:42.854 --> 15:44.987
We have to save it.

15:45.031 --> 15:46.684
- No.

15:46.728 --> 15:50.036
We have to save Sarah.

15:50.079 --> 15:51.385
And the only thing
that's gonna do that

15:51.428 --> 15:52.386
is a new heart.

15:52.429 --> 15:53.735
Because the old one

15:53.778 --> 15:55.824
is out of time.

15:55.867 --> 16:01.786
â™ª

16:03.484 --> 16:03.658
.

16:03.701 --> 16:06.313
- The waiting list for
heart transplants isn't short,

16:06.356 --> 16:07.836
but the good news is
you're at the top.

16:07.879 --> 16:10.447
And priority goes
to the most severe cases

16:10.491 --> 16:12.232
that can withstand
a transplant.

16:12.275 --> 16:16.149
- Wow. That's, uh, great.
Also...

16:16.192 --> 16:17.541
totally terrifying.

16:17.585 --> 16:19.456
- Right. So, uh...

16:19.500 --> 16:20.588
OTF gets us a heart.

16:20.631 --> 16:22.590
We fix the hemophilia, and...

16:22.633 --> 16:23.852
you walk out of here.

16:23.895 --> 16:25.810
That's the plan.
- I like the plan.

16:25.854 --> 16:27.421
- Me too, so...

16:27.464 --> 16:28.596
Hang in there.

16:28.639 --> 16:30.076
- Question.

16:30.119 --> 16:32.513
Sorry, this is kind of weird.

16:32.556 --> 16:37.344
- No. I'm your doctor,
you can ask me anything.

16:37.387 --> 16:39.781
- Did you have a sister?

16:39.824 --> 16:44.438
â™ª

16:44.481 --> 16:47.919
You're Luna's brother.

16:47.963 --> 16:49.443
- How did you know?

16:49.486 --> 16:51.662
- Your sister gave me
her heart.

16:51.706 --> 16:55.318
My...folks told me
all about her.

16:55.362 --> 16:56.624
Her family.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.321
When you said your name, I...

16:58.365 --> 17:01.803
- It didn't seem, uh,
fair to...

17:01.846 --> 17:02.804
say anything.

17:02.847 --> 17:04.284
You need to focus on you.

17:04.327 --> 17:07.374
And, uh, really,
we are strangers.

17:07.417 --> 17:09.463
I mean, we've never even
met before.

17:09.506 --> 17:11.813
- Yeah, we did.

17:11.856 --> 17:14.468
You don't remember?

17:14.511 --> 17:16.774
- Sorry, no.
Where did we meet?

17:16.818 --> 17:19.777
- We met in Cold Spring.

17:19.821 --> 17:22.215
- Oh.

17:22.258 --> 17:23.912
Wow, I haven't thought about

17:23.955 --> 17:27.611
Cold Spring in...years.

17:27.655 --> 17:28.656
We used to go there
on the weekends.

17:28.699 --> 17:29.657
There was this dock.

17:29.700 --> 17:30.875
My sister and I would jump off

17:30.919 --> 17:32.268
and we thought we were...
[chuckles]

17:32.312 --> 17:33.878
You know,

17:33.922 --> 17:35.663
cliff divers.
We loved it.

17:35.706 --> 17:37.534
- Yeah, I know.

17:37.578 --> 17:39.493
That's, uh...

17:39.536 --> 17:41.277
that's where I saw you.

17:41.321 --> 17:43.801
At Luna's funeral.

17:43.845 --> 17:45.368
- No, I...

17:45.412 --> 17:49.198
I didn't go to the funeral.

17:49.242 --> 17:52.288
- You--you did.

17:52.332 --> 17:57.293
It was in Cold Spring
a week after the transplant.

17:57.337 --> 18:01.776
After the funeral I, uh,
I saw you on that dock.

18:01.819 --> 18:04.170
Skipping stones.

18:04.213 --> 18:06.563
Well, you were trying
to skip stones.

18:06.607 --> 18:08.261
You were...

18:08.304 --> 18:11.873
You were really bad at it.

18:11.916 --> 18:17.574
So I went up and I asked you
how the stones were going.

18:17.618 --> 18:22.231
You said--
I'll never forget.

18:22.275 --> 18:24.364
Your sister promised
to teach you.

18:24.407 --> 18:27.802
The next time you came.

18:27.845 --> 18:30.674
It was the first time
it hit me.

18:30.718 --> 18:35.592
I was only here
'cause another girl wasn't.

18:35.636 --> 18:40.815
So I showed you.

18:40.858 --> 18:43.557
- You taught me
how to skip stones.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.603
- Yeah.

18:46.647 --> 18:48.257
- I got Mad Libs.

18:48.301 --> 18:52.566
I just--I couldn't believe
they still publish these.

18:55.482 --> 18:57.788
- See anything you like?

18:59.355 --> 19:00.878
- My patient needs a study

19:00.922 --> 19:02.489
that's going to
deliver results.

19:02.532 --> 19:04.926
I'm more intrigued
by what I don't see.

19:04.969 --> 19:06.623
Definitive conclusions.

19:06.667 --> 19:08.016
- Well, my sample size
isn't large enough

19:08.059 --> 19:09.452
for that kind of certainty, but

19:09.496 --> 19:10.932
I like where we're heading.

19:10.975 --> 19:12.673
- Strong words

19:12.716 --> 19:15.458
from someone failing
more than he succeeds.

19:15.502 --> 19:16.590
- It's cancer.

19:16.633 --> 19:18.679
I'll take any wins I can get.

19:18.722 --> 19:21.334
And each success gets me
a little closer to a cure.

19:21.377 --> 19:22.770
- Well, you know what they say.

19:22.813 --> 19:25.425
Close only counts in horseshoes
and hand grenades.

19:25.468 --> 19:28.776
- And a couple other things.

19:28.819 --> 19:31.474
- You must know your reputation
precedes you.

19:31.518 --> 19:33.563
- My reputation for
exceptional results?

19:33.607 --> 19:35.696
- Your reputation for
exceptional charisma

19:35.739 --> 19:39.700
and aptitude for salesmanship.
And I am immune.

19:39.743 --> 19:41.876
Because I have
the same reputation.

19:41.919 --> 19:45.793
I'm only paying attention
to the numbers.

19:45.836 --> 19:48.317
- You got your file
upside down.

19:48.361 --> 19:50.319
Made you look.

19:55.933 --> 19:58.109
- What would you say
to somebody who says

19:58.153 --> 20:01.069
you sell quixotic hope in lieu
of medical certainty?

20:01.112 --> 20:03.332
- I'd say that someone
is right.

20:03.376 --> 20:05.769
Clinical trials are riskier
than chemo.

20:05.813 --> 20:07.075
They're also the only way
to find a treatment

20:07.118 --> 20:08.990
better than chemo.

20:09.033 --> 20:10.513
Yeah, they're quixotic,
and yeah,

20:10.557 --> 20:11.993
most of the time
it doesn't work.

20:12.036 --> 20:13.429
But when it does,

20:13.473 --> 20:15.301
it's gonna change the world.

20:15.344 --> 20:16.824
- But it may never work.

20:16.867 --> 20:19.348
- Even Don Quixote
hit a couple of windmills.

20:19.392 --> 20:22.699
- He lunged at one and then
promptly fell off his horse.

20:22.743 --> 20:26.007
How soon will you know
if my patient's eligible?

20:28.575 --> 20:30.054
- Max Goodwin.

20:30.098 --> 20:31.708
You're treating your boss.

20:31.752 --> 20:33.101
- No, I'm treating my patient,

20:33.144 --> 20:35.669
who also happens
to be my friend.

20:35.712 --> 20:36.931
- I have to warn you,
I don't accept patients

20:36.974 --> 20:38.585
based on prominence.

20:38.628 --> 20:40.021
The integrity of the study
is too important.

20:40.064 --> 20:41.631
- Of course.

20:41.675 --> 20:45.461
- And at first glance,
this is not a great fit.

20:45.505 --> 20:47.071
That's not a "no."

20:47.115 --> 20:48.595
Give me a beat,
let me get into it.

20:48.638 --> 20:50.031
I'll get back to you.

20:50.074 --> 20:52.468
- Thank you for your honesty.

20:52.512 --> 20:54.122
- And you for yours.

20:54.165 --> 20:56.777
Even though you were
a little bit mean.

20:56.820 --> 20:59.997
[lively percussive music]

21:00.041 --> 21:01.912
- Okay. This...

21:01.956 --> 21:03.436
is you.

21:03.479 --> 21:05.046
- Do you mind if I Insta this?

21:05.089 --> 21:06.090
- Eh.

21:06.134 --> 21:07.570
Ah, what the heck. Yeah.

21:07.614 --> 21:09.485
Just, uh, no video, okay?

21:09.529 --> 21:10.878
All right, so.

21:10.921 --> 21:13.097
Do you see the dark spots
here on the ends?

21:13.141 --> 21:15.709
Those are your
epiphyseal plates.

21:15.752 --> 21:17.014
That's the stuff inside
your bones

21:17.058 --> 21:18.059
that does all the growing.

21:18.102 --> 21:19.669
Now, looking at this,

21:19.713 --> 21:22.063
we can estimate more or less
how much more growing

21:22.106 --> 21:24.065
you are going to do.

21:24.108 --> 21:26.981
- So how tall am I gonna be?

21:27.024 --> 21:30.463
- I'm pleased to report, tall.

21:30.506 --> 21:31.942
Not, uh, NBA tall.

21:31.986 --> 21:34.423
But, you know, top shelf tall.

21:34.467 --> 21:36.730
- #Topshelftall...

21:36.773 --> 21:38.209
- Yes, you are
in very good health, Shay.

21:38.253 --> 21:39.820
All the doctors here agree

21:39.863 --> 21:41.822
that you will be a prime
candidate for top surgery

21:41.865 --> 21:44.085
in about a year.

21:44.128 --> 21:45.478
- A year?

21:45.521 --> 21:46.522
- Yeah. I mean, I know
you were hoping

21:46.566 --> 21:48.002
for something a little sooner,

21:48.045 --> 21:50.570
but, uh, we have to take
medical into consideration.

21:50.613 --> 21:52.963
It's surgery.

21:53.007 --> 21:55.836
- Now you sound
just like my parents.

21:55.879 --> 21:57.490
- Listen, you've only been
on hormone blockers

21:57.533 --> 21:58.926
for about six months.

21:58.969 --> 22:01.494
We need to see how it affects
your breast tissue

22:01.537 --> 22:05.019
before we can decide what
surgery will be right for you.

22:05.062 --> 22:07.935
- So a cisgender doctor
gets to tell me

22:07.978 --> 22:10.807
what's right for me.

22:10.851 --> 22:13.506
Okay. Got it.

22:13.549 --> 22:14.898
Got it.

22:14.942 --> 22:16.509
- All right.

22:16.552 --> 22:19.207
I hear that you're upset,

22:19.250 --> 22:20.861
but I need you to hear me

22:20.904 --> 22:23.951
when I tell you that I want you
to have the surgery.

22:23.994 --> 22:25.518
I said so to your parents.

22:25.561 --> 22:26.780
- Screw this.

22:26.823 --> 22:28.608
And screw you.

22:30.784 --> 22:32.089
- Okay, thanks.

22:32.133 --> 22:33.961
Bye.

22:34.004 --> 22:36.964
[sniffling]

22:37.007 --> 22:38.095
- What's wrong?

22:38.139 --> 22:40.141
- Oh, I'm fine.

22:40.184 --> 22:41.490
- Please, what's the matter?

22:41.534 --> 22:42.622
- Nope, it's nothing.

22:42.665 --> 22:44.972
Honestly.

22:45.015 --> 22:47.931
[sighing]

22:51.979 --> 22:55.896
My dog, Gertie, has cancer.

22:55.939 --> 22:56.897
- I'm so sorry.

22:56.940 --> 22:58.289
- [sniffling]

22:58.333 --> 23:00.248
- Is there anything to be done?
- No.

23:00.291 --> 23:03.599
I mean, surgery, but...

23:03.643 --> 23:05.993
It costs more than I make
in a month.

23:06.036 --> 23:07.821
I'm gonna have to put
my little girl to sleep

23:07.864 --> 23:12.216
unless I can come up
with $2,000.

23:12.260 --> 23:13.783
I'm sorry.

23:13.827 --> 23:16.525
You do not need to be
thinking about this.

23:16.569 --> 23:18.309
I'm fine, thank you.

23:18.353 --> 23:20.834
Hey, Becky,
I'm gonna take five.

23:20.877 --> 23:23.097
[crying]

23:25.665 --> 23:26.840
- Okay, we're starting
to back up down here.

23:26.883 --> 23:27.841
Turan, help me clear
some space.

23:27.884 --> 23:29.059
What do you got?

23:29.103 --> 23:30.060
- Got an upper GI
bleeder in curtains.

23:30.104 --> 23:31.279
Waiting on GI.

23:31.322 --> 23:32.280
- Hemodynamically stable?
- Yes.

23:32.323 --> 23:33.803
- Then send him home.

23:33.847 --> 23:35.065
He can get a scope
as an outpatient.

23:35.109 --> 23:36.066
- And a weak and dizzy
in Bay 13.

23:36.110 --> 23:37.851
- I'll meet you there.

23:37.894 --> 23:39.069
- Surgery cleared him
for conservative treatment.

23:39.113 --> 23:40.810
- Okay.

23:40.854 --> 23:42.943
We're gonna treat you
with medicine, Mr. Powell.

23:42.986 --> 23:44.814
No surgery. So we'll get you
out of here real soon.

23:44.858 --> 23:45.946
Sound good?

23:45.989 --> 23:47.643
Sound good?
- [mumbles]

23:47.687 --> 23:49.210
- And we'll give you something
for the nausea.

23:49.253 --> 23:51.691
Start Cephilicam, and when
he can eat and drink

23:51.734 --> 23:53.257
he can go home.

23:53.301 --> 23:56.260
[lively percussive music]

23:56.304 --> 24:03.354
â™ª

24:05.182 --> 24:07.315
Casey, uh, did you give
Mr. Powell...

24:07.358 --> 24:10.231
- Levofloxacin
plus metronidazole.

24:10.274 --> 24:13.800
Just like you said.

24:13.843 --> 24:15.584
- Right.
Just like I said.

24:15.628 --> 24:16.890
Great.

24:16.933 --> 24:20.067
- Need me to make
any other adjustments?

24:20.110 --> 24:22.025
- No.

24:22.069 --> 24:25.028
[tense music]

24:25.072 --> 24:27.901
â™ª

24:27.944 --> 24:29.685
- Thank you again,
Dr. Kleinman.

24:29.729 --> 24:30.991
I know that
this is moving fast,

24:31.034 --> 24:32.340
but, uh, Sarah Madsen's case

24:32.383 --> 24:33.689
is the definition
of time-sensitive.

24:33.733 --> 24:35.038
- Mm-hmm.
- I've spoken to

24:35.082 --> 24:36.649
one of your reps over
at OTF already

24:36.692 --> 24:37.954
and they have agreed
to move Sarah

24:37.998 --> 24:39.652
to the top
of the transplant list.

24:39.695 --> 24:41.305
- Hmm.
- We have a viable donor

24:41.349 --> 24:42.742
in our ICU right now,

24:42.785 --> 24:44.221
a brain-dead MVA, actually.

24:44.265 --> 24:45.745
And so go ahead and say
the word, and we--

24:45.788 --> 24:46.963
- I'm going to stop you
right there.

24:47.007 --> 24:48.095
- Okay?

24:48.138 --> 24:49.879
- I'm certainly impressed

24:49.923 --> 24:50.880
with your due diligence,

24:50.924 --> 24:52.186
your patient's hemophilia

24:52.229 --> 24:53.970
is too compromising.

24:54.014 --> 24:55.102
She isn't healthy enough

24:55.145 --> 24:56.233
to receive a new heart.

24:56.277 --> 24:58.322
I'm very sorry.

24:58.366 --> 25:00.194
- No, so--wait a minute,
wait a minute.

25:00.237 --> 25:01.935
Uh, on paper, yes.

25:01.978 --> 25:04.024
I see what you see.
But, uh, this woman...

25:04.067 --> 25:06.679
This woman, she can do this.
Believe me.

25:06.722 --> 25:08.115
Will you tell her?

25:08.158 --> 25:09.769
- Her INR and creatinine
clearance are normal.

25:09.812 --> 25:10.987
Hepatic function excellent.

25:11.031 --> 25:12.598
Her--Her kidneys are fine.

25:12.641 --> 25:13.990
- Right, and she has never
shown any signs

25:14.034 --> 25:15.165
of bone marrow suppression.

25:15.209 --> 25:16.950
- Dr. Goodwin,
this isn't personal.

25:16.993 --> 25:19.779
OTF has strict requirements
to ensure healthy organs

25:19.822 --> 25:22.303
are not placed into bodies
that cannot support them.

25:22.346 --> 25:23.304
Plain and simple.

25:23.347 --> 25:24.348
Sarah Madsen does not qualify.

25:24.392 --> 25:26.307
- No, wait, wait, wait.

25:26.350 --> 25:28.614
Sorry.

25:28.657 --> 25:31.704
There has gotta be
something that I can do

25:31.747 --> 25:36.709
to convince you
to give Sarah this heart.

25:36.752 --> 25:40.190
- She needs to complete three
normal-range PTT tests

25:40.234 --> 25:41.278
in a row.

25:41.322 --> 25:44.194
- Consider it done.

25:47.067 --> 25:48.677
- She's not gonna make it, Max.
- Yeah, well,

25:48.721 --> 25:50.026
it's gonna be hard--
- She could barely pass

25:50.070 --> 25:52.028
one PTT three hours ago.

25:52.072 --> 25:53.769
The chances of her
passing three in a row

25:53.813 --> 25:56.859
before her heart gives out?

26:07.696 --> 26:07.870
.

26:07.914 --> 26:09.176
- So...

26:09.219 --> 26:10.525
You said that passing

26:10.569 --> 26:11.613
one of these tests
would be hard.

26:11.657 --> 26:13.441
- It will be.

26:14.964 --> 26:17.271
- Well, I freaking hate
failing tests.

26:17.314 --> 26:19.360
- Oh, yeah, like you'd know.

26:19.403 --> 26:21.754
My wife seems like
this cool New York chick.

26:21.797 --> 26:23.364
"Oh, I'm a social worker.

26:23.407 --> 26:24.757
Look at my cool haircut."
- [laughing] Okay.

26:24.800 --> 26:25.845
Okay, you know,

26:25.888 --> 26:27.368
you dye your hair purple once,

26:27.411 --> 26:28.412
you never hear the end of it.

26:28.456 --> 26:30.197
- But she is a nerd.

26:30.240 --> 26:31.807
She has never failed a test.

26:31.851 --> 26:33.548
Not once in her whole life.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.724
[machine beeping]

39:11.566 --> 39:12.741
- I have to pick up
his cell samples

39:12.785 --> 39:14.700
and give you some paperwork.

39:14.743 --> 39:17.877
- Oh, well, uh, I-I'm sure we
can have someone pick that up.

39:17.920 --> 39:18.965
- It's too risky.

39:19.008 --> 39:20.532
See, this paperwork includes

39:20.575 --> 39:22.925
two tickets to see
Lauryn Hill at BAM.

39:22.969 --> 39:27.887

39:27.930 --> 39:30.585
Hey, if, uh, if I was
off-base here,

39:30.629 --> 39:32.761
I apologize. I just, uh...

39:32.805 --> 39:34.546
- I was just thinking about

39:34.589 --> 39:36.591
what to do with
the extra ticket.

39:36.635 --> 39:39.028
- Well, I might have
a suggestion.

39:40.813 --> 39:42.728
- Dr. Mendez, ER One.

39:42.771 --> 39:45.208
Dr. Mendez to ER One.

39:48.603 --> 39:50.779
- How's she doing?

39:50.823 --> 39:52.520
- Really well.

39:52.564 --> 39:54.087
Thanks to you.

39:54.130 --> 39:55.523
- Good.

39:55.567 --> 39:57.003
The next few weeks
are critical, so

39:57.046 --> 39:58.918
stay close to her.

39:58.961 --> 40:01.877
And keep us informed.

40:01.921 --> 40:04.576
- My wife is an optimist.

40:04.619 --> 40:08.536
And the minute
she found out

40:08.580 --> 40:10.495
that it was your sister,

40:10.538 --> 40:14.803
she had me arrange this.

40:18.677 --> 40:23.159
It's her way of thanking
you both.
