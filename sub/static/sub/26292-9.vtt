00:03.655 --> 00:04.004
.

00:04.047 --> 00:07.485
- I found a clinical trial.

00:07.529 --> 00:10.140
Precision-targeted
immunotherapy.

00:10.184 --> 00:13.056
It's led by Dr. Panthaki
at St. Simon's.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.666
He's highly regarded.

00:14.710 --> 00:17.582
And, unlike radiation
and chemo,

00:17.626 --> 00:22.152
it comes with no debilitating
side effects.

00:22.196 --> 00:24.154
- That sounds perfect.

00:24.198 --> 00:25.329
- It's exactly what he wanted.

00:25.373 --> 00:27.723
- All right.
Dr. Sharpe gets it done.

00:27.766 --> 00:30.247
- Which is the difference
between me and this trial.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.162
Because precision therapy
might not work.

00:32.206 --> 00:34.556
- Your objection is noted.
Again.

00:34.599 --> 00:37.167
- Yes, radiation chemotherapy
is challenging,

00:37.211 --> 00:38.777
but it's--
- It's brutal.

00:38.821 --> 00:41.215
It's--It's hitting yourself with
a brick over and over again

00:41.258 --> 00:42.564
and hoping the cancer
dies first.

00:42.607 --> 00:44.044
- That's the point.

00:44.087 --> 00:46.133
The cancer dies.

00:46.176 --> 00:48.352
Radiation
and chemotherapy work.

00:48.396 --> 00:50.267
Precision therapy is like
gambling your life

00:50.311 --> 00:52.052
on a lottery ticket.

00:52.095 --> 00:54.141
- People said the same thing
about bone marrow transplants.

00:54.184 --> 00:55.794
- They also say it
about lottery tickets.

00:55.838 --> 00:58.058
- Enough.

01:00.886 --> 01:05.065
Is this what you really want?

01:10.418 --> 01:11.636
- She's right.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.074
Chemo and radiation,
they work.

01:14.117 --> 01:16.293
They do the job.

01:16.337 --> 01:19.731
But...they'll break me.

01:19.775 --> 01:21.429
No matter how strong I am.

01:21.472 --> 01:24.127
I'll lose my hearing.

01:24.171 --> 01:26.825
My sight.

01:26.869 --> 01:29.437
I'll lose my mind.

01:29.480 --> 01:32.614
They don't always come back.

01:32.657 --> 01:36.270
And I have so many things...

01:36.313 --> 01:41.188
that I need to do.

01:41.231 --> 01:44.365
- So let's get in the trial.

01:48.586 --> 01:51.372
- So let's get in the trial.

I didn't see you there.

02:06.169 --> 02:07.127

would have covered it,

02:07.170 --> 02:08.128
maybe even a text.

02:08.171 --> 02:09.433
But now we're here in person

be groveling.

to be a jerk here,

that we used to--

02:17.311 --> 02:18.834

- It wasn't cool.

02:18.877 --> 02:20.531
- I said I know.

02:20.575 --> 02:23.795
- What you should be saying
is, "I am sorry."

02:23.839 --> 02:26.276
- I am. I'm sorry.

02:26.320 --> 02:29.192
- You don't sound sorry.

have this be a thing, okay?

you're the one who said

02:32.456 --> 02:33.805

17:39.536 --> 17:41.277

how the stones were going.

I'll never forget.

to teach you.

they still publish these.

18:55.482 --> 18:57.788

18:59.355 --> 19:00.878
- My patient needs a study

19:00.922 --> 19:02.489
that's going to
deliver results.

19:02.532 --> 19:04.926

by what I don't see.

19:04.969 --> 19:06.623

isn't large enough
