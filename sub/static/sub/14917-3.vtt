WEBVTT

00:00.060 --> 00:01.990
Previously on "brothers & sisters"...

00:02.070 --> 00:04.360
did you know that you were our number-one associate this month?

00:04.440 --> 00:05.120
No,I didn'T.

00:05.200 --> 00:07.130
We were very impressed at the partners' meeting.

00:07.190 --> 00:08.470
We're keeping our eye on you.

00:08.540 --> 00:11.050
Wed houlstop wasting time worrying about how it might end,

00:11.130 --> 00:13.330
because maybe-- maybe it won't end.

00:13.470 --> 00:16.059
We have a $20-million loan hanging over our heads.

00:16.120 --> 00:17.990
Cuts are gonna have to be made across the board.

00:18.070 --> 00:19.600
Why do I get the feeling I'm about to be fired?

00:19.660 --> 00:21.730
You're not,but other people will have to be.

00:21.790 --> 00:23.700
We lost ojai as a client.

00:23.760 --> 00:24.510
How?

00:24.590 --> 00:25.620
My brother fired us.

00:25.690 --> 00:27.480
They're in a financial bind.
They're trying to save money.

00:27.480 --> 00:30.180
"A family in politics" by kitty walker.

00:30.260 --> 00:31.520
Did she write that?

00:31.570 --> 00:33.120
You know if you publish this,
you're gonna have to resign.

00:33.180 --> 00:36.250
-What?What do you mean? 
-I can't have people on my staff writing books.

00:36.300 --> 00:39.100
But it's completely up to you.

00:41.490 --> 00:42.810
You can't actually do that.

00:42.890 --> 00:44.810
You can't just chuck out the ojai name.

00:44.890 --> 00:46.760
You'll erase our entire family's history.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.180
It's called walker landing.

00:48.250 --> 00:50.020
I'd say the family stays pretty front and center.

00:50.080 --> 00:51.770
Oh,I see.What about brand loyalty,tommy?

00:51.830 --> 00:53.420
People have been buying ojai foods for years.

00:53.500 --> 00:56.470
Well,we may lose some customers in the transition,

00:56.510 --> 01:00.640
but we will more than make up for that by targeting the higher-end markets.

01:00.700 --> 01:03.110
that's right.We relaunch ojai foods under our brand.

01:03.110 --> 01:06.030
We can raise the prices.We charge more,we make more.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.800
It makes perfect financial sense.

01:07.840 --> 01:09.660
For walker landing,not for ojai foods.

01:09.700 --> 01:11.280
Why are you two so against this?

01:11.340 --> 01:12.920
It's like you won't consider anything

01:12.980 --> 01:15.870
that will actually get us out from under this colossal debt.

01:15.940 --> 01:17.030
That's not true,tommy.

01:17.090 --> 01:18.160
Well,check the numbers.

01:18.220 --> 01:20.660
Our profit margins are much higher on wine than fruit.

01:20.720 --> 01:22.630
Okay,then let's make more wine.

01:22.690 --> 01:24.100
Good,I'm glad that you agree,

01:24.160 --> 01:28.520
because we want to convert 500 acres of ojai orchards into a vineyard.

01:28.580 --> 01:32.210
-Are you kidding? -Why would you rip out 500 acres that's turning a profit

01:32.250 --> 01:34.340
and put in a new crop that won't yield for seven years?

01:34.360 --> 01:36.160
That's insane.I won't let you do that.

01:36.220 --> 01:39.530
Well,actually,it's the board's decision,not yours.

01:41.960 --> 01:43.480
You're unbelievable.

01:43.540 --> 01:44.990
You just don't stop.

01:45.070 --> 01:49.210
You just keep on encroaching on everything that belongs to this family.

01:49.270 --> 01:50.450
Sarah,enough.

01:50.510 --> 01:52.000
500 acres isn't everything.

01:52.060 --> 01:54.420
No,tommy,but by the time she's finished,they'll be nothing left--

01:54.480 --> 01:57.010
not that it'll matter because you're already calling it walker landing.

01:57.070 --> 01:58.510
Okay,okay,that's it.I've had it.

01:58.560 --> 01:59.920
-where are you going? -Where am I going?

01:59.980 --> 02:01.510
You think I'm gonna sit here and argue with you when you know

02:01.550 --> 02:03.300
you and tommy are gonna bring this to the board.

02:03.400 --> 02:04.470
-Right -You're damn right we are..

02:04.530 --> 02:07.810
The board needs to see that there's a vision that's gonna turn this company around,

02:07.850 --> 02:10.370
all right?And this is mine.

02:10.740 --> 02:12.450
And holly's behind me.

02:13.320 --> 02:16.120
Well,good luck with that,because you two,you're on yo own.

02:23.150 --> 02:24.740
God,I love being back in new york.

02:24.800 --> 02:27.250
Everything is just...alive.

02:27.350 --> 02:28.340
L.A.'S alive...

02:28.400 --> 02:29.220
too alive.

02:29.280 --> 02:30.320
But here,you can walk.

02:30.380 --> 02:32.410
Do you know that I went to see four publishers yesterday

02:32.490 --> 02:33.970
and I never even got into a car?

02:34.040 --> 02:34.940
How's it going?

02:35.020 --> 02:36.150
Well,nothing yet.

02:36.230 --> 02:38.830
You know what?They wouldn't know a good book if it bit 'em in the butt.

02:38.830 --> 02:40.650
Have you seen the best seller list lately?

02:40.690 --> 02:42.490
Oh,no,no,no.They--they're all interested.

02:42.490 --> 02:45.400
I'm just not sure that I am.I have,you know...

02:45.460 --> 02:46.680
a lot to give up.

02:46.720 --> 02:48.440
Is robert really gonna make you quit if you publish?

02:48.500 --> 02:50.510
Well,yeah,and I happen to agree with him,mother.

02:50.600 --> 02:54.300
I mean,I-I certainly can't work with people that I wrote a book about.

02:54.370 --> 02:57.290
It's just-- and I'm--
I'm just here feeling everything out.

02:57.350 --> 03:01.700
I mean,it's better than sitting around,waiting for the adoption agency to call.

03:01.780 --> 03:04.250
I love your social worker.

03:04.280 --> 03:06.610
She didn't think that dinner was so bad.

03:06.670 --> 03:08.810
Of course,it didn't get bad until after she left.

03:08.870 --> 03:11.580
Mother,please.Are you seriously still mad at robert?

03:11.640 --> 03:14.700
Kitty,you know what?He completely misunderstood what I was saying.

03:14.700 --> 03:18.600
He--he accused me of hating your honesty and your outspokenness.

03:18.660 --> 03:19.800
I love that about you.

03:19.840 --> 03:20.850
You have to let it go.

03:20.930 --> 03:22.300
You know,robert hasn't even mentioned it.

03:22.380 --> 03:27.110
He's--he's too obsessed with our new neighbors and their awful hives.

03:27.270 --> 03:28.780
Your neighbors have hives?

03:28.860 --> 03:30.250
Well,isn't that petty of him?

03:30.330 --> 03:31.750
They can't help a skin condition.

03:31.830 --> 03:33.160
Beehives,mother.

03:33.240 --> 03:34.410
I'm talking about beehives.

03:34.470 --> 03:35.480
Beehives?

03:35.560 --> 03:36.990
It's their hobby or something.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.120
I don't know.They have a lot of bees.

03:39.670 --> 03:41.060
I'm gonna have to call you back,honey.

03:41.140 --> 03:42.370
Mom?

03:43.310 --> 03:45.540
Mom,it's just a uniform,okay?

03:45.620 --> 03:46.910
I'm not going back to war.

03:46.990 --> 03:49.070
I'm going to work at a recruitment center in south pas.

03:49.140 --> 03:50.640
I don't know why they're making you do that.

03:50.720 --> 03:51.730
I mean,you already served.

03:51.790 --> 03:52.990
You were wounded,for god sake.

03:53.050 --> 03:54.340
I'm still enlisted,remember?

03:54.420 --> 03:55.850
I mean,at least they're not sending me back to iraq.

03:55.910 --> 03:58.310
No,they're making you send other kids to iraq.

03:59.940 --> 04:00.700
I'm sorry.

04:00.760 --> 04:02.170
I shouldn't have said that.

04:05.160 --> 04:08.500
Justin,you look so handsome and clean-shaven.

04:09.260 --> 04:11.040
Hey,hey,I-I thought I was driving you.

04:11.130 --> 04:13.510
Well,actually,the recruitment center is right by my new job.

04:13.590 --> 04:14.670
New job?

04:14.750 --> 04:16.000
What,in photography?

04:16.079 --> 04:19.230
Uh,no.Actually,I'm--
I'm temping for a dana drew diet center.

04:19.290 --> 04:20.329
Well...

04:20.370 --> 04:21.720
that's good,too.

04:21.800 --> 04:24.000
yeah,turns out we're both working at mini malls.So...

04:24.070 --> 04:25.710
all right,I love you,mom.

04:27.980 --> 04:29.150
it sounds awful.

04:29.210 --> 04:30.740
It doesn't matter how it sounds.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.540
What matters is you agreed to come.

04:32.600 --> 04:35.630
So...I...tomorrow night,you and me,
7:00,client dinner.

04:35.690 --> 04:39.080
I just-- scotty,the partners have never 
asked me to step up like this before,okay?

04:39.180 --> 04:40.860
They're all bringing their spouses.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.700
I do not want to be the only one there without a date.

04:42.760 --> 04:43.690
A "date"?

04:43.770 --> 04:44.960
Ah,sorry.Spouse.

04:44.960 --> 04:47.120
So I do really need you there.

04:47.180 --> 04:49.710
if you have made plans with someone else,
please reschedule.

04:49.770 --> 04:51.210
-Okay,fine. -Thank you.

04:51.210 --> 04:53.650
Why it so crucial for you to bring a spouse anyway?

04:53.690 --> 04:56.330
Because it validates us in the eyes of the client.

04:56.390 --> 05:00.250
If,for some godforsaken reason,
someone on this planet does want to love,

05:00.310 --> 05:02.910
honor and cherish a lawyer,we can't be all that bad.

05:02.990 --> 05:05.530
I'm so glad we had our commitment ceremony.

05:05.610 --> 05:07.020
I didn't put a ring on your finger for nothing.

05:07.100 --> 05:09.560
and if I do manage to bag these guys,

05:09.620 --> 05:12.330
it'll be like losing the ojai account never even happened.

05:12.960 --> 05:14.100
All right,fine.

05:14.180 --> 05:15.600
Who are we wining and dining anyway?

05:15.660 --> 05:16.890
Core athletics.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.430
You realize I know nothing about sports.

05:18.510 --> 05:20.250
Yeah,which is why I have us both covered.

05:20.310 --> 05:23.640
I made espn one of my preset buttons on the radio months ago.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.030
Wow,it's like I don't even know you right now.

05:27.050 --> 05:28.690
We'll be here when you decide.

05:29.470 --> 05:31.670
Corporal,come here,would you?

05:32.240 --> 05:33.420
sure.

05:36.100 --> 05:37.280
Hey,have a seat.

05:37.870 --> 05:39.160
Uh,yes,sir.

05:40.490 --> 05:44.430
You know,this is the second time today 
that I've heard you talking about 9/11.

05:45.050 --> 05:46.700
Uh,it's the reason I enlisted,sir.

05:46.760 --> 05:50.160
Well,it's a noble reason,but that kid was what--

05:50.220 --> 05:52.520
12,13 years old when those towers came down?

05:52.580 --> 05:55.300
He cannot relate to it the same way that you or I can.

05:55.340 --> 05:58.440
You need to speak to him in a language 
that he clearly understands.

05:59.160 --> 06:00.710
Stick to the script.

06:01.090 --> 06:03.050
Did you give him the dog tags or the nascar passes?

06:03.130 --> 06:04.160
Uh,no,sir.

06:04.220 --> 06:06.160
I,uh,I thought it would be better to,
uh,hand him some literature.

06:06.220 --> 06:09.130
It is not your place to question the army's tactics,son.

06:09.480 --> 06:10.780
We went over the protocol.

06:10.860 --> 06:13.830
Yes,sir.I-I just don't think he really 
understood what he was getting into.

06:13.890 --> 06:15.640
Then give him an idea.

06:15.950 --> 06:21.770
Mission,honor,brotherhood-- talk to him about that.

06:21.830 --> 06:24.690
Make him feel like he's part of something bigger,
something that matters.

06:25.120 --> 06:26.130
Yes,sir.

06:26.230 --> 06:27.480
It,uh,it won't happen again,sir.

06:27.560 --> 06:30.510
Corporal,I know it may feel like we're asking you to,

06:30.590 --> 06:34.310
uh,convince people to go to a place that we never wanna see again.

06:34.510 --> 06:37.320
But our men and women need reinforcements.

06:37.870 --> 06:39.800
Do you understand that,corporal?

06:40.580 --> 06:41.890
Good.

06:43.900 --> 06:45.680
This guy called while you were busy.

06:45.760 --> 06:48.180
He said he might be,uh,stopping by later.

06:50.230 --> 06:51.270
I don't recognize the name.

06:51.330 --> 06:52.960
Maybe it's a potential recruit.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.690
Well,let's hope so.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.280
You have another customer.

07:00.460 --> 07:01.770
It was unbelievable.

07:01.850 --> 07:04.500
Tommy just unleashed his inner donald trump.

07:04.580 --> 07:06.710
500 acres!

07:06.850 --> 07:08.760
Is that even legal?

07:09.840 --> 07:10.660
Kevin?

07:10.740 --> 07:12.560
Oh,I'm sorry.Were you waiting for me to say something?

07:12.600 --> 07:15.330
'Cause I have this weird recollection of being fired from ojai foods.

07:15.390 --> 07:17.070
I didn't fire you.Tommy fired you.

07:17.130 --> 07:20.230
Yeah,which is exactly why I will not speak with him.

07:20.290 --> 07:21.930
Oh,come on.I defended you.

07:21.970 --> 07:24.860
Now I need you to help me come up with a response to this.

07:25.250 --> 07:27.490
Okay,it takes a two-thirds majority to approve.

07:27.550 --> 07:29.870
Mom's a board member,and I think she'd rather jump on the table

07:29.930 --> 07:31.820
and open a vein than lose the ojai name.

07:31.880 --> 07:34.670
Maybe I should just come up with my own proposal--kill holly.

07:34.760 --> 07:35.710
I'd kill tommy.

07:35.770 --> 07:37.360
Not nearly as satisfying.

07:37.420 --> 07:40.410
Which is why I think we would be the perfect firm for you 
and the rose bowl committee.

07:40.470 --> 07:41.690
The rose bowl?What?

07:41.730 --> 07:42.850
-Absolutely.  -Kevin?

07:42.920 --> 07:43.790
-Okay,thank you. -Kevin?

07:43.870 --> 07:45.420
Let's--let's talk soon.Thank you.

07:46.750 --> 07:47.640
Rose bowl committee?

07:47.720 --> 07:50.130
Yeah,just,uh,just trying to drum up some new clients.

07:50.200 --> 07:53.780
You must be feeling pretty confident not to be focusing on core athletics.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.660
Are you ready to land us a multimillion-dollar account?

07:55.720 --> 07:56.710
Are you kidding me?

07:56.790 --> 07:59.860
Last night,I had a dream I had to recite their latest earnings report verbatim,

07:59.920 --> 08:02.010
and I did,perfectly.

08:02.140 --> 08:04.260
I'm a little concerned about their C.E.O.

08:05.210 --> 08:09.580
Ron robinson has a-a reputation for being pretty tough to win over.

08:09.640 --> 08:11.490
Right,because he's a perfectionist.

08:11.560 --> 08:14.180
He tries every sneaker personally before they release a new line.

08:14.240 --> 08:15.530
He's--he's like my mom.

08:15.600 --> 08:16.780
I know exactly how to handle him.

08:16.850 --> 08:18.330
I'm sure you will.

08:19.120 --> 08:20.900
But I've been to a lot more of these dinners,

08:20.980 --> 08:23.960
and it's not just about selling the firm.

08:24.800 --> 08:26.160
It's about making that...

08:26.310 --> 08:28.000
that personal connection.

08:30.680 --> 08:32.950
You may want to think about flying solo on this one.

08:33.720 --> 08:34.650
Flying solo?

08:34.700 --> 08:36.270
Give robinson all your attention.

08:36.330 --> 08:38.299
Don't make him compete with anyone else.

08:40.460 --> 08:41.250
I'm sorry.

08:41.330 --> 08:43.500
Are--are you asking me to leave scotty at home?

08:43.500 --> 08:47.410
I'm just saying that sometimes potential clients can be unpredictable.

08:47.450 --> 08:49.730
And you don't want the night to become an uphill battle.

08:50.100 --> 08:52.220
We all want you to become partner,kevin.

08:52.870 --> 08:56.550
You land this deal,you're next in line.

08:59.480 --> 09:00.780
Okay.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.980
You will do something about this.this is a public health issue.

09:10.040 --> 09:11.790
All right?There are children involved.

09:11.850 --> 09:13.840
My next phone call is gonna be to the president.

09:15.700 --> 09:17.840
Wow,who's getting chewed out,cabinet member,

09:17.900 --> 09:20.050
congressman,my mom?

09:21.140 --> 09:22.330
No,it's a neighbor.

09:22.410 --> 09:24.520
He's got some beehives that I want moved.

09:24.580 --> 09:26.190
So you're gonna call the president?

09:26.430 --> 09:27.750
I'm bluffing.

09:27.830 --> 09:28.920
Uh,is kitty around?

09:28.980 --> 09:30.840
No,she's still in new york.What's up?

09:30.900 --> 09:32.400
Okay,I'll talk to her when she gets back.No biggie.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.010
-No,come in. -Nothing.it's fine.

09:34.070 --> 09:35.250
Just tell her I,you know--

09:35.310 --> 09:37.230
kevin,you clearly earmarked some time to talk to kitty.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.720
So,you know...

09:38.780 --> 09:40.160
hit me.

09:41.670 --> 09:42.920
You know what?

09:43.150 --> 09:45.270
You may be the perfect person to talk to.

09:45.780 --> 09:49.030
I mean,no one compromises their beliefs more than politicians,right?

09:49.140 --> 09:50.470
I'm so flattered.

09:50.530 --> 09:51.420
Go on.

09:51.460 --> 09:56.470
Okay,so my boss has asked me to disinvite scotty from a cent dinner.

09:56.710 --> 09:59.190
I guess he doesn't want the client to know that I'm gay.

09:59.310 --> 10:00.720
Did he use those exact words?

10:00.800 --> 10:04.360
No,he danced around it like baryshnikov,
but we both knew what he watalking about.

10:04.460 --> 10:08.340
The point is,I've become fixated with becoming partner,

10:09.130 --> 10:11.810
and I kinda said yes.

10:11.870 --> 10:13.450
But this guy carter-- he's vindictive.

10:13.510 --> 10:15.220
He could easily block my promotion.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.040
Sacrificing for the greater good.

10:17.290 --> 10:18.540
Welcome to the real world.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.040
So what do I do?

10:20.090 --> 10:21.210
Sell out peter to pay paul?

10:21.290 --> 10:23.350
Yeah,I mean,you're pretty much the expert.

10:23.470 --> 10:25.380
Hey,I resent that.

10:25.460 --> 10:27.530
I have never sold anybody out,unless...

10:27.830 --> 10:29.630
of course,I absolutely had to.

10:29.690 --> 10:32.960
Oh,right,like the time you were asked 
not to mention the fact you had a gay brother.

10:33.020 --> 10:36.400
I never deny that,but I also don't feel the need to grandstand about it either.

10:36.520 --> 10:38.210
Yeah,I've always hated that about you.

10:38.270 --> 10:42.030
Hey,jason's lied about his sexuality for years.

10:42.110 --> 10:45.080
It was his only way to get through seminary,much less find a parish.

10:45.150 --> 10:46.740
Jason ended up serving god.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.020
I'm a corporate lawyer.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.270
Then solve it from the inside.

10:49.330 --> 10:50.490
Once you get the corner office,

10:50.570 --> 10:54.070
nobody from that firm's ever gonna ask 
somebody to leave their partner at home.

10:54.400 --> 10:55.740
That's it?

10:55.820 --> 10:57.110
The end justifies the means?

10:57.170 --> 10:58.560
Not always,but...

10:58.650 --> 11:02.030
you can live a very principled life and not do a damn bit of good for anybody.

11:03.760 --> 11:06.570
why do I feel like either way,I'm still gonna get screwed?

11:06.630 --> 11:07.910
Well,there's always a price.

11:07.990 --> 11:10.110
You just gotta figure out whether it's worth it.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.820
First he calls this out of the blue meeting,
and now he's late.

11:15.860 --> 11:18.340
Yeah,well,he's probably coming up with some new reasons

11:18.400 --> 11:20.780
why our proposal is the wrong way to go.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.850
I doubt it.It wouldn't take this long.

11:23.890 --> 11:24.910
Sorry I'm late.

11:24.990 --> 11:26.550
The printer was on the fritz.

11:28.410 --> 11:29.310
What's this?

11:29.390 --> 11:31.180
It's my letter of resignation.

11:31.320 --> 11:32.490
I don't belong here anymore.

11:32.560 --> 11:33.490
What are you talking about?

11:33.580 --> 11:34.590
You've been here forever.

11:34.660 --> 11:36.680
I'm also resigning my seat from the board.

11:36.870 --> 11:39.100
Saul,is this a negotiating tactic?

11:39.170 --> 11:40.850
No,holly,it's not.

11:41.450 --> 11:42.870
No,w--hold on.

11:42.930 --> 11:44.470
Saul,we've gotta talk about this.

11:44.530 --> 11:45.920
You can't convince me.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.750
This company is changing,and maybe I'm too old to change with it,

11:49.810 --> 11:51.280
or maybe I just don't want to.

11:51.340 --> 11:53.440
Well,there's gotta be something that we can do.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.310
Accept my resignation.

11:55.990 --> 11:57.730
-I'm sorry. 
-Saul.

12:03.440 --> 12:04.780
You can't just leave.

12:04.840 --> 12:07.540
You can't leave me alone while she dismantles everything

12:07.600 --> 12:09.480
that my father built,everything that you built.

12:09.550 --> 12:11.230
Tommy's right.They need to make changes.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.560
It was a very practical decision on their part,sarah.

12:13.620 --> 12:14.940
Come on,saul.You don't believe that for a minute.

12:14.940 --> 12:16.860
This was not an easy decision for me.

12:16.910 --> 12:18.760
I'm at time in my life when I-- 
when what,saul?

12:18.840 --> 12:20.050
Just because you're coming out,you--

12:20.110 --> 12:21.710
you want out of everything?

12:21.770 --> 12:22.980
You got me into this mess.

12:23.040 --> 12:24.080
Where's your loyalty?

12:24.160 --> 12:26.410
I've been loyal to this family for 40 years,sarah.

12:26.660 --> 12:29.240
I was loyal to your father.
I was loyal to tommy.I'm loyal to you.

12:29.300 --> 12:33.160
I almost gave up my entire life out of loyalty to this family,so

12:33.220 --> 12:35.730
-don't start with loyalty. -Then fight.

12:35.810 --> 12:38.250
Stay and fight for this family.

12:38.310 --> 12:40.910
I can't,sarah.I just can'T.

justin walker?

12:56.980 --> 12:58.630
Anthony lewis.Nice to meet you.

12:58.700 --> 13:00.170
How are you?I've been looking for you forever.

13:00.230 --> 13:01.900
They sa--they said you'd be working here today.

13:01.980 --> 13:03.360
Uh,I'm sorry.Do I know you or...

13:03.360 --> 13:07.420
sort of.I was in th um,the 81st combat team.

13:07.460 --> 13:11.160
Wweere hit by that bomb in south baghdad last august,
by the elementary school.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.350
Ah,you probably-- you probably don't remember.
It was a hectic day,so...

13:16.400 --> 13:18.510
no,I,uh,I-I remember.

13:18.570 --> 13:20.920
Well,uh,the records,they say that,uh,

13:20.980 --> 13:22.630
they say you're the one that pulled me out.

13:22.690 --> 13:24.060
You saved my life,man.Owe you.

13:24.140 --> 13:26.360
No,I was just doing my job.

13:26.440 --> 13:28.530
You medics always say that,man.

13:29.140 --> 13:30.430
Well,anyway,look...

13:30.550 --> 13:32.590
um,the wife and I,
we don't live too far from here.

13:32.670 --> 13:37.110
So,uh,you know,we thought it might be nice to maybe have you come over.

13:37.170 --> 13:41.980
You know,not that,you know,
dinner's much of a thank-you or anything,but...

13:43.760 --> 13:46.000
you know,I-I don't-- I don't know if I can,uh...

13:46.080 --> 13:48.360
aw,come on,man.The kids...

13:48.460 --> 13:50.430
they'd really like it.

13:50.520 --> 13:52.140
You're kind of a,uh...

13:52.460 --> 13:55.120
I guess you could say you're a heron our family now.

14:01.030 --> 14:02.280
Are you sure about this?

14:02.390 --> 14:03.810
Yeah,I think so.

14:05.020 --> 14:07.370
Just...going there every day,

14:07.430 --> 14:11.080
supporting people and denying myself,I--

14:11.140 --> 14:13.440
and then the life that I lived before I...

14:14.570 --> 14:16.410
before you came out?

14:16.970 --> 14:18.410
Came out.

14:18.490 --> 14:21.470
No,it seems to me that coming out is something young people do.

14:22.740 --> 14:25.170
Sarah's furious with me.

14:25.230 --> 14:26.810
She thinks I abandoned her.

14:26.880 --> 14:28.220
Well,that's ludicrous.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.080
No,it's not.It was in the heat of the moment.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.620
And actually,she has a point.I mean,

14:31.680 --> 14:35.200
I was the one who signed off the deal on golden plum,

14:35.280 --> 14:37.650
and I'm the reason that ojai is in this financial trouble.

14:37.730 --> 14:39.860
She's--she has a right to be outraged.

14:39.950 --> 14:41.510
Saul,listen to me.

14:41.590 --> 14:43.590
What happened at ojai happened.

14:43.670 --> 14:46.340
You can't go on blaming yoself the rest of your life.

14:46.740 --> 14:48.570
That's true.

14:48.950 --> 14:51.200
I think maybe I should retire,nora.

14:52.020 --> 14:53.600
I don't need a job.

14:53.740 --> 14:55.360
I need a life.

14:55.440 --> 14:56.670
You need to meet someone.

14:56.750 --> 14:57.680
How do you know I haven't?

14:57.740 --> 14:59.180
Have you?

14:59.280 --> 15:01.180
A man can dream,can't he?

15:03.380 --> 15:05.780
don't worry about sarah,all right?

15:05.840 --> 15:08.440
You just keep on dreaming.

15:08.860 --> 15:10.400
Okay.

15:12.400 --> 15:15.460
I'm sure this is exactly what you pictured 
when I said I'd cook dinner.

15:15.560 --> 15:16.650
No,it's fine.

15:16.730 --> 15:18.230
No,it's pretty lame,actually.

15:18.290 --> 15:20.790
I really thought I'd have time to go to the market,

15:20.850 --> 15:23.030
but the phones were ringing off the hook.

15:23.310 --> 15:28.030
Apparently,taking the breakfast burrito off the menu
--not a good idea.

15:28.240 --> 15:30.480
But at least we get free food,and hey,

15:30.570 --> 15:33.570
our carbs and proteins are perfectly balanced.

15:36.370 --> 15:38.390
Okay,say something,because I'm really sick of

15:38.470 --> 15:40.980
having a conversation with myself about diet food.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.500
What?It's good.

15:43.190 --> 15:44.490
No,I'm not talking about the food.

15:44.570 --> 15:46.220
I wanna talk about your day.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.520
It was all right.

15:47.640 --> 15:49.930
"All right"?That's it?

15:50.010 --> 15:51.440
Yeah,you know,it was all right.

15:51.520 --> 15:53.170
You know,I don't know what else to say.

15:53.310 --> 15:54.910
Well,tell me what happened.

15:55.160 --> 15:56.360
Nothing.You know,I,uh,

15:56.420 --> 15:58.210
i talked to some high school kids about joining up,

15:58.270 --> 16:01.130
I felt like crap about it,
and then I bumped into some guy I was in iraq with,

16:01.200 --> 16:03.270
and he asked me to go to dinner,so I said sure.

16:03.350 --> 16:05.000
Well,that sounds nice.

16:05.630 --> 16:07.280
You think I could go with you?

16:08.400 --> 16:09.900
I don't know.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.410
Why not?I-I've never met any of the guys you served with.

16:13.410 --> 16:14.640
Well,he wasn't in my unit.

16:14.710 --> 16:17.320
I just feel weird about bringing 
someone unannounced,you know?

16:18.390 --> 16:19.380
Well,could you call?

16:19.440 --> 16:21.680
Rebecca,why are you so obsessed?

16:21.740 --> 16:23.950
I--it's just dinner,okay?You don't even know the guy.

16:23.950 --> 16:27.570
Yeah,well,if he's your friend,
then i would like to get to know him.

16:27.630 --> 16:29.370
But if this is your way of taking it slow or--

16:29.460 --> 16:31.150
becca,if you wanna come,come.

16:31.630 --> 16:33.960
All right?I don't see what the big deal is.

16:35.340 --> 16:37.030
Neither do I.

16:41.290 --> 16:43.190
How's my overworked husband?

16:43.250 --> 16:44.590
Overworked.

16:44.690 --> 16:46.320
good news--you're off the hook for tomorrow night.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.370
I thought everyone was supposed to bring their spouses.

16:48.430 --> 16:50.570
Yeah,they are.But,you know,you were right.

16:50.630 --> 16:52.050
I think it's gonna be awful.And besides,

16:52.130 --> 16:54.190
why do we have to be so hetero-normative?

16:54.250 --> 16:56.020
Sounds like you're chickening out.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.010
No,not at all.

16:57.100 --> 17:00.510
By the same token,I don't think we have anything to prove.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.480
Kevin,you feel weird about bringing me.Admit it.

17:03.540 --> 17:05.540
I don't feel weird about anything at all.

17:07.190 --> 17:09.020
-What? 
-Kevin...

17:14.700 --> 17:17.849
my boss is worried that if you were to be there with me,

17:17.910 --> 17:22.690
the client may become distracted,which is his code for saying "offended,"

17:22.770 --> 17:26.910
which is just,I don't know,a pleasant way of 
saying he's not sure whether this guy likes homos,

17:26.960 --> 17:30.080
and he doesn't want anything to stand in the way of the contract.

17:30.140 --> 17:31.810
Oh,my god.

17:32.360 --> 17:33.990
I'm sorry.

17:34.070 --> 17:35.240
I thought you'd be mad.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.230
Well,I am,at your boss.

17:37.310 --> 17:38.850
I can't believe he's putting you in this position.

17:38.940 --> 17:40.610
What did you say?

17:41.730 --> 17:44.870
You know,scotty,I am this close to making partner.

17:46.530 --> 17:49.710
Look,I can do a lot more from a corner office than I can from a cubicle.

17:49.770 --> 17:50.780
You're not in a cubicle,kevin.

17:50.860 --> 17:52.390
That's a metaphor.It...

17:52.450 --> 17:54.930
carter all but said if I do this right,I'm there.

17:54.990 --> 17:56.820
Does that corner office have a big walk-in closet?

17:56.880 --> 17:58.340
That's not fair.This is one dinner.

17:58.420 --> 17:59.600
I think we both know it's more than that.

17:59.680 --> 18:00.730
So what am i supposed to do?

18:00.830 --> 18:03.580
I've worked my ass off for this firm for years.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.400
If I left now,I'd have to start over.

18:05.460 --> 18:06.630
I'm not asking you to start over.

18:06.690 --> 18:07.530
What are you asking?

18:07.600 --> 18:09.220
I'm asking you to be careful.

18:09.310 --> 18:11.940
Look,kevin,you deserve to make partner,

18:12.000 --> 18:14.740
but you also deserve to be who you are.

18:15.600 --> 18:18.070
You've been working pretty hard at that,too,remember?

18:23.950 --> 18:25.050
you sure you wanna come in?

18:25.130 --> 18:27.150
You seem intent on waking the neighbors.

18:28.110 --> 18:30.490
I just had dinner with saul.

18:31.490 --> 18:34.620
Did he tell you about his sudden retirement?

18:34.700 --> 18:36.980
He told me he was leaving ojai,yes.

18:37.480 --> 18:39.300
Do you want some tea?I just made it.

18:39.380 --> 18:40.730
No.

18:40.790 --> 18:43.050
I think you owe him an apology.

18:44.430 --> 18:48.600
Oh,I thought you came over here to commiserate,
not to reprimand me.

18:48.680 --> 18:50.130
Did you even let him explain?

18:50.210 --> 18:54.010
Mom,he sprung this on me at the worst possible time.

18:54.150 --> 18:56.110
I know this is a difficult time for you,sarah,

18:56.190 --> 18:59.620
but would you please try to see this from saul's perspective?

18:59.700 --> 19:02.420
He's finally taking this huge step forward in his life.

19:02.490 --> 19:03.880
He needs your support.

19:03.970 --> 19:05.540
Mom,he should be supporting ojai.

19:05.620 --> 19:07.180
I needed him at that meeting tomorrow.

19:07.240 --> 19:09.090
Did--did he tell you what they wanna do?

19:09.150 --> 19:10.070
Yes.I talked to tommy.

19:10.070 --> 19:12.240
I know about the 500 acres.

19:12.300 --> 19:14.410
And honestly,given the situation,it--

19:14.470 --> 19:16.180
it sounds like a reasonable proposal.

19:16.240 --> 19:18.990
Reasonable?What about the rebranding,losing the ojai name?

19:19.050 --> 19:20.330
You think that's reasonable,too?

19:20.410 --> 19:21.600
I don't wanna take sides.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.110
Mom,you're already taking sides.

19:23.190 --> 19:24.730
You're taking saul's side.

19:24.810 --> 19:27.790
actually,it sounds like you're taking tommy and holly's side.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.510
He deserted me,mom.

19:32.140 --> 19:36.200
You have no idea what it's like to go to work for her every day.

19:36.280 --> 19:37.890
Not with her,

19:37.940 --> 19:40.000
for her,

19:40.060 --> 19:41.680
every day.

19:42.460 --> 19:46.010
are you angry at saul for quitting,or angry at yourself for not?

19:46.070 --> 19:47.810
What are you talking about?

19:48.350 --> 19:50.830
I told you,sarah,don't martyr yourself for ojai.

19:50.910 --> 19:53.080
Quit.

19:53.380 --> 19:57.100
I'm a single mother with a mortgage,tuition payments and alimony.

19:57.180 --> 19:58.740
I can't just...

19:58.800 --> 19:59.720
quit.

19:59.780 --> 20:00.930
Then do something else.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.450
You have an M.B.A.,Experience--

20:02.510 --> 20:03.440
oh,really,mom?

20:03.520 --> 20:06.900
In this job market,you think I can take that kind of risk?

20:08.400 --> 20:10.880
Fine,then it's your choice to stay.

20:11.170 --> 20:15.430
And if you truly believe that tommy is making 
the wrong decision for ojai,then fight.

20:15.510 --> 20:17.860
Convince the board.I'll support you.

20:17.930 --> 20:20.600
But make your own decision,sarah,

20:20.680 --> 20:23.070
and don't blame saul for making his.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.890
Pick some up where you buy groceries to enjoy at home.

20:30.950 --> 20:33.330
no,no,I'm sure they just didn't hear the bell.

20:33.540 --> 20:35.950
Justin,it's gonna be fine,okay?

20:37.140 --> 20:38.550
sorry.

20:38.690 --> 20:39.710
You guys made it.Great.

20:39.790 --> 20:41.330
How are you?

20:41.390 --> 20:43.010
Great,great,great.Come on in.

20:48.550 --> 20:50.000
hey,everybody.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.770
Corporal walker.

20:56.640 --> 20:58.580
you didn't tell me it was gonna be a party.

20:58.640 --> 21:00.110
Uh,what are we celebrating?

21:00.170 --> 21:02.430
you're here!

21:02.490 --> 21:04.320
I'm maggie,anthony's wife.

21:04.420 --> 21:06.350
Uh,justin.Nice to meet you.

21:06.410 --> 21:08.190
Oh,I know who you are.

21:08.270 --> 21:10.340
Uh,this--this is rebecca.

21:10.810 --> 21:12.430
We brought you a little somethg.
Nice to meet you.

21:12.470 --> 21:13.870
Oh,thank you.

21:13.950 --> 21:15.720
Uh,let me show you guys around.

21:20.800 --> 21:24.000
Thank you for what you did for my son.

21:24.410 --> 21:27.330
And this is my mom anita,
in case you couldn't tell.

21:27.560 --> 21:28.770
Uh,justin.

21:28.850 --> 21:30.490
-Thank you. -Nice to meet you.

21:30.550 --> 21:31.650
What's going on?

21:31.710 --> 21:34.000
And,uh,this is everybody else.
This is my grandmother.

21:34.070 --> 21:35.030
Hello.

21:35.090 --> 21:36.430
This is my,uh,best friend sam.

21:36.490 --> 21:37.970
My brother terrance.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.600
My two boys right here.

21:40.540 --> 21:42.110
look at this.

21:42.880 --> 21:44.810
uh,wow,that's,uh,that's a nice sign.

21:44.900 --> 21:46.550
They've been working on it all day.

21:46.610 --> 21:50.120
They wanted to do something for 
the man who saved their daddy's life.

21:50.880 --> 21:52.380
What?

21:55.610 --> 22:00.200
we think reapportioning the land 
and converting into a vineyard is a smart long-term move.

22:00.260 --> 22:02.430
We've been leasing this land from other growers.

22:02.490 --> 22:06.050
This lets us keep up with the demand without the extra cost.

22:06.150 --> 22:08.700
I'd like to get back to the rebranding issue.

22:08.760 --> 22:11.850
Nora,are you really okay with this name change?

22:13.730 --> 22:15.690
I don't know.I...

22:15.740 --> 22:17.830
I can't say it doesn't make me nervous.

22:17.890 --> 22:19.790
People trust ojai products.

22:19.870 --> 22:22.240
When something disappears,
I don't know,I move on.

22:22.320 --> 22:23.430
I look for something new.

22:23.510 --> 22:24.510
It makes me nervous,too.

22:24.590 --> 22:25.970
You're already buried in debt.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.560
and down a C.F.O.

22:27.640 --> 22:31.970
I don't know how you all feel,
but saul's departure does not exactly give me confidence.

22:32.030 --> 22:35.570
Saul felt that it was time for him to retire.

22:35.630 --> 22:37.790
But this decision he made for himself.

22:37.870 --> 22:40.130
It had nothing to do with this proposal.

22:40.220 --> 22:43.530
I think saul would agree 
that these figures you presented are reasonable

22:43.620 --> 22:46.720
but I don't see any room for contingencies if something goes wrong.

22:46.790 --> 22:50.550
I'm sorry,tommy,but this option seems rushed

22:50.630 --> 22:55.100
and far too risky for a company in such a precarious situation.

22:55.190 --> 22:57.080
I agree.

22:57.160 --> 23:00.760
I agree this company is in a very precarious situation.

23:00.840 --> 23:03.640
Reallocating that much land is very ambitious.

23:03.720 --> 23:06.580
Rebranding our ojai products even more so.

23:07.370 --> 23:09.050
But come on.

23:09.130 --> 23:11.390
Ambition is nothing new to this company.

23:11.470 --> 23:13.240
My father built ojai on a wing and a prayer.

23:13.340 --> 23:15.130
He didn't have contingencies.

23:15.210 --> 23:16.710
He had a vision.

23:16.770 --> 23:19.920
And he was prepared to take risks because he believed in it.

23:19.980 --> 23:24.200
I-I'd like you to consider,
what if william walker was sitting here?

23:24.260 --> 23:26.360
Would you be so skeptical?

23:26.440 --> 23:30.280
With all due resct,william's not the one here guiding us.

23:30.360 --> 23:31.850
True.

23:31.930 --> 23:33.520
Tommy is.

23:33.550 --> 23:36.180
My father taught him everything he knew.

23:36.260 --> 23:37.770
Now doubt me all you want.

23:37.850 --> 23:43.430
I got us into the deal that put the company 
in this precarious position in the first place.

23:43.490 --> 23:47.680
And to get out of it,we're gonna need vision,
the kind of vision that my father had.

23:48.430 --> 23:50.090
Tommy has it.

23:50.170 --> 23:52.330
I think we should trust him.

23:52.600 --> 23:57.180
I do,and I believe my father would have,too.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.790
Excellent choice of wine,carter.

24:09.850 --> 24:11.440
Actually,kevin suggested it.

24:11.520 --> 24:12.790
His family's in the business.

24:12.850 --> 24:13.870
really?

24:13.990 --> 24:15.310
That's so glamorous.

24:15.390 --> 24:16.760
That's what I keep telling ron.

24:16.820 --> 24:18.160
Give your gym some glamour.

24:18.220 --> 24:20.240
Let people sweat in luxury.

24:20.320 --> 24:22.790
She thinks smoothie bars add luxury.

24:23.470 --> 24:27.240
last time I was at one of your gyms,
I drank two of your banana bliss in a row.

24:27.320 --> 24:28.860
I'm actually afraid to go back.

24:28.950 --> 24:30.810
I think I put weight on that day.

24:31.450 --> 24:34.540
I told her-- guys don't want to sit on 
their asses and drink milkshakes,

24:34.620 --> 24:37.790
because that's what they are-- 
milkshakes at a gym.

24:37.850 --> 24:39.730
How did your family get into wine?

24:39.790 --> 24:41.120
Byrinking it,mainly.

24:41.200 --> 24:44.300
I think my brother actually uses us as quality control.

24:44.690 --> 24:45.690
Wise man.

24:45.790 --> 24:50.190
You know,I personally test every athletic shoe 
before it hits the market.

24:50.270 --> 24:51.330
Really?I didn't know that.

24:51.330 --> 24:53.160
But that's how we are at the firm.

24:53.240 --> 24:54.610
I mean,if you were to sign with us,

24:54.690 --> 24:57.110
you'd be guaranteed personal attention at all times.

24:59.330 --> 25:01.720
Hope you save some attention for your wife.

25:03.670 --> 25:06.020
yeah,of course I do.

25:06.100 --> 25:07.310
Sorry she couldn't join us.

25:07.370 --> 25:09.150
How long you two beenedarri?

25:13.890 --> 25:15.120
since last may.

25:15.220 --> 25:17.180
Ah,you're still in the honeymoon phase.

25:17.680 --> 25:20.430
give it a year or two,she'll be ruling the roost.

25:20.480 --> 25:21.640
I wouldn't worry about kevin.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.360
I can't see anybody pushing him around.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.320
He's a bulldog when he wants to be.

25:25.630 --> 25:27.270
Isn't that right?

25:27.810 --> 25:29.410
That's me.

25:35.780 --> 25:37.830
pretty good save in there tonight.

25:38.190 --> 25:42.560
You know,the,uh,the board voted 5 to 1 in favor of our proposal.

25:42.860 --> 25:44.490
You're welcome.

25:45.240 --> 25:47.040
Did you mean what you said in there?

25:48.250 --> 25:49.500
It's what you wanted,tommy.

25:49.580 --> 25:51.470
And I owe you that support,

25:51.860 --> 25:55.050
especially since I won't be working here after today.

25:56.020 --> 25:57.450
What?

25:57.990 --> 25:59.820
I'm quitting.

25:59.950 --> 26:01.710
You're kidding,right?

26:04.020 --> 26:05.290
Right.

26:05.370 --> 26:06.820
I see.

26:06.880 --> 26:08.740
I overrule you,and now what?

26:08.800 --> 26:10.040
Now you're punishing me?

26:10.140 --> 26:11.080
No,tommy.

26:11.160 --> 26:14.320
That vision that I was talking about,I don't have it.

26:14.380 --> 26:16.480
All I see is holly and what she's doing.

26:16.540 --> 26:17.980
You mean,trying to save our company?

26:18.040 --> 26:20.800
It doesn't feel like our company anymore.

26:20.860 --> 26:23.690
Ojai always used to feel like home,and now,for many reasons--

26:23.790 --> 26:26.570
some of which are my fault-- 
it just--it feels like a job.

26:26.650 --> 26:28.130
No,you can'T.I won't let you do this.

26:28.220 --> 26:29.180
I've made up my mind.

26:29.260 --> 26:31.580
Well,your timing sucks.

26:32.380 --> 26:33.900
I'm sorry.

26:48.890 --> 26:50.830
I can't believe you went to altadena high school.

26:50.950 --> 26:53.160
That's crazy.That's,like,our--our rivals.

26:53.220 --> 26:55.110
Is--oh,god,what's his name?Is coach pays--

26:55.190 --> 26:56.350
paysinger still there?

26:56.430 --> 26:59.670
Yeah,yeah,he,uh,he coaches baseball now,too.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.690
They're finally asleep...

27:02.790 --> 27:04.300
I think.

27:04.460 --> 27:05.940
Where did everybody go?

27:06.020 --> 27:07.770
Ah,it was--it was gettin' late,baby.

27:07.850 --> 27:09.090
Yeah,I think we should...

27:09.160 --> 27:10.110
well,no,no,no,wait.

27:10.190 --> 27:12.610
I-I wanted you,uh,to finish that story.
Where were we?

27:12.690 --> 27:14.560
Um,did you finally find the convoy?

27:14.640 --> 27:16.500
Rebecca,I don't-- don't-- no,justin.

27:16.600 --> 27:19.540
Anthony promised he'd at least tell me how you saved his life.

27:19.620 --> 27:21.280
Look,I don't think anybody wants to talk about it,all right?

27:21.360 --> 27:22.380
No,no,no,no,no.

27:22.460 --> 27:23.400
No,it's cool,it's ol.

27:23.480 --> 27:25.610
I mean,you probably know the story better than I do.

27:25.690 --> 27:26.850
You were conscious the whole time.

27:26.930 --> 27:27.790
Yeah,come on.Tell me.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.040
It was nothing,all right?

27:29.120 --> 27:31.290
it was a hell of a lot more than nothing,man.

27:31.370 --> 27:32.290
Justin,come on.I want--

27:32.370 --> 27:35.020
rebecca,can you just stop,all right?

27:38.790 --> 27:40.210
Look,I'm--I'm--I'm sorry.

27:40.310 --> 27:41.740
I gotta go.

27:41.840 --> 27:43.580
Sorry.

27:44.430 --> 27:46.520
Maybe you should give him some space.

27:49.120 --> 27:51.170
hey,you know what?I'll go talkm.

27:52.910 --> 27:54.730
O hi I just kon'tnow what I did.

27:54.830 --> 27:55.980
It's not you.

27:56.060 --> 27:58.820
It's just that some guys,
they just have a harder time...

27:58.900 --> 28:00.680
talking about what happened over there.

28:00.760 --> 28:03.240
Justin has a hard time talking about everything,so,um...

28:04.500 --> 28:06.100
I'm sorry.

28:10.740 --> 28:12.560
justin left.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.620
what can I get ya?

28:29.770 --> 28:31.540
Whatever you got on tap.

28:45.070 --> 28:45.850
I did it.

28:45.930 --> 28:46.660
What?

28:46.740 --> 28:48.420
I am officially unemployed.

28:48.480 --> 28:49.800
I quit.

28:49.880 --> 28:51.510
I quit ojai.

28:51.610 --> 28:53.350
Sweetheart...

28:53.750 --> 28:54.960
come in.I'll make you something to eat.

28:54.960 --> 28:57.010
Oh,no,no,no.I couldn't eat.

28:57.080 --> 28:58.790
I could drink.

28:59.110 --> 29:00.750
Well,how did tommy take it?

29:00.810 --> 29:02.340
Not good.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.330
God.

29:08.620 --> 29:11.210
I feel like I just-- 
I just got divorced again.

29:11.270 --> 29:12.750
It's not that bad.

29:14.240 --> 29:15.960
And I have no idea what I'm gonna do.

29:16.020 --> 29:17.150
It's gonna be okay.

29:17.240 --> 29:17.900
How do you know?

29:17.990 --> 29:20.160
Because I saw you in the boardroom today.You were incredible.

29:20.230 --> 29:21.500
I was?Yes.

29:21.580 --> 29:26.300
I felt that I needed to shore up the board's confidence in tommy.

29:26.360 --> 29:27.980
Which is ironic,because...

29:28.060 --> 29:29.840
I don't really have a lot in myself right now.

29:29.940 --> 29:34.110
Oh,sarah,only you could've convinced 
the board to change their minds like that--

29:34.170 --> 29:36.200
not tommy...Certainly not holly.

29:36.280 --> 29:37.500
You have a gift.

29:37.560 --> 29:40.090
Sweetheart,I know you feel your life is a disaster right now...

29:40.160 --> 29:40.740
oh,god!

29:40.820 --> 29:42.180
but it's not.Trust me.

29:42.240 --> 29:43.540
Honestly,it's gonna be okay.

29:43.600 --> 29:44.580
I hope you're right.

29:44.660 --> 29:47.550
Otherwise,me and the kids are moving in.

29:47.630 --> 29:48.710
Well,that would be all right.

29:48.790 --> 29:50.510
Don't even joke about it.

29:50.570 --> 29:53.460
All right,all right,all right,all right.

29:58.100 --> 30:02.050
The no vote-- that was you,wasn't it?

30:02.480 --> 30:05.530
No way in hell I was voting to lose the ojai name.

30:07.510 --> 30:10.440
the degree of difficulty is 3.2

30:19.450 --> 30:21.160
how was the dinner?

30:23.440 --> 30:25.630
Well,I've been putting a dent in our tivo backlog,

30:25.690 --> 30:27.970
and I'm all the way up to the summer olympics.

30:30.400 --> 30:31.670
Did it not go well?

30:31.730 --> 30:34.540
Oh,no,it was the kind of evening every young associate dreams of.

30:34.570 --> 30:39.320
I was the perfect sommelier,
I walked them through the advantages of carter,

30:39.400 --> 30:41.790
wright and dupress-- so much so,by the end of the night,

30:41.880 --> 30:46.130
good ol' ron practically insisted 
that I take over the account personally.

30:46.210 --> 30:47.250
So you got it?

30:47.330 --> 30:48.810
Yeah,I got it.

30:48.890 --> 30:52.750
But in a moment of faustian proportions,

30:52.790 --> 30:54.730
I pretended to be straight.

30:54.790 --> 30:56.230
Wasn't that kind of the plan?

30:56.290 --> 30:58.100
I think it's one thing to leave you at home,

30:58.200 --> 31:02.690
but it's certainly another to take advice on how to deal with your new bride.

31:04.900 --> 31:06.550
they thought you were married to a woman.

31:06.630 --> 31:08.250
Yeah,because I let them.

31:08.350 --> 31:11.390
And right now,I practically feel sick to my stomach.

31:12.600 --> 31:16.840
You know,for the first time in my life,
I went back into the closet after coming out.

31:16.890 --> 31:19.200
And you were absolutely right.

31:19.360 --> 31:21.590
It's a very dark place.

31:21.650 --> 31:23.380
Then don't do it again...

31:24.140 --> 31:28.080
or do,but you can't play the game 
and second-guess yourself at the same time.

31:28.160 --> 31:30.850
Either accept what you did because it'll get you what you want,

31:30.910 --> 31:35.030
or go in there tomorrow and tell them 
you're drawing a line in the sand.

31:35.150 --> 31:36.630
Make a decision.

31:36.710 --> 31:38.770
I don't care which one.

31:41.440 --> 31:43.440
You're absolutely right.

31:44.680 --> 31:48.050
And I'm gonna go in tomorrow morning and tell carter exactly what I think.

31:48.110 --> 31:51.400
Good,because I actually did care which one you chose.

31:55.380 --> 31:57.430
I feel a whole lot better already.

31:57.530 --> 31:59.100
You wanna watch the rest with me?

31:59.890 --> 32:01.610
you know what?I'm kinda exhausted.

32:01.700 --> 32:04.110
It's the diving competition.

32:11.270 --> 32:14.770
well,I did want to get into some more sports.

32:20.800 --> 32:22.380
where have you been?

32:22.720 --> 32:23.700
What are you doing here?

32:23.780 --> 32:25.280
Waiting for you.It's 1:00 in the morning!

32:25.340 --> 32:27.320
Where the hell have you been?

32:28.020 --> 32:28.910
justin!

32:28.990 --> 32:29.980
A bar,okay?

32:30.080 --> 32:31.940
And I don't feel like talking about it.

32:32.640 --> 32:34.070
Did you drink?

32:34.440 --> 32:35.490
Justin,did you drink?

32:35.580 --> 32:38.220
No!Okay?What,do you want a play-by-play of everything I've done tonight?

32:38.300 --> 32:40.860
Excuse me?I have every right to be upset and worried about you right now.

32:40.960 --> 32:44.350
I just spent the entire night wandering around the city with anthony looking for you.

32:44.420 --> 32:45.530
Look,I'm sorry,okay?

32:45.610 --> 32:46.790
I,uh,I don't know what to tell you.I'm sorry.

32:46.860 --> 32:49.820
And why is it so awful that I want to know how it was for you out there?

32:49.880 --> 32:51.600
I mean,you will not talk to me about iraq.

32:51.690 --> 32:53.450
Because I don't want to tell you about it,okay?

32:53.530 --> 32:55.320
Because there's the war,then there's you.

32:55.410 --> 32:56.360
They don't mix.

32:56.440 --> 32:57.880
As far as I'm concerned,there's you,and there's me,

32:57.960 --> 32:59.920
there's everything in between--
that's a real relationship.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.170
Well,I guess we don't have a real relationship,do we?

33:02.240 --> 33:04.490
Why?Because I wanna get to know the guy that I'm dating?

33:04.570 --> 33:06.730
Here's a tip-- the guy you're dating is a nobody.

33:06.820 --> 33:11.400
That guy anthony,his--his family thinks
 I'm some hero because I saved his life?

33:11.480 --> 33:13.710
You know who's life i didn't save that night?

33:13.790 --> 33:15.760
My friend charlie.

33:15.840 --> 33:18.080
He died 20 feet away from me,rebecca.

33:18.180 --> 33:19.400
20 feet away from me!

33:19.480 --> 33:22.720
So how am I supposed to look these kids in the eye that come into the center

33:22.800 --> 33:24.890
and convince them that this is where they need to go?

33:24.950 --> 33:26.600
Justin,it's not your fault.

33:26.680 --> 33:29.400
You're not responsible for the choices 
that other people make in their lives.

33:29.480 --> 33:31.730
You know what?You're right,
because I can't control my own life.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.980
Okay?Because I'm a loser and I'm an addict,like--

33:34.060 --> 33:35.180
no,justin.No,you're not!

33:35.260 --> 33:36.430
I still wake up here and I live with my mother,okay?

33:36.510 --> 33:39.770
Because I'm too messed up to worry about my freakin'...

33:42.130 --> 33:43.430
great.

33:43.490 --> 33:47.210
I'm gonna go upstairs and go to sleep,
unless you wanna talk about that,too.

33:53.820 --> 33:55.050
Rebecca?

33:55.300 --> 33:56.920
you don't have to leave.

33:58.600 --> 33:59.810
I think I should.

33:59.930 --> 34:01.290
I'm sorry.

34:13.040 --> 34:14.199
Well,you're up.

34:14.260 --> 34:15.620
Oh,I couldn't hide up there forever.

34:15.679 --> 34:17.440
Besides,I miss my mother.

34:17.670 --> 34:19.050
Oh,yeah,right.

34:20.480 --> 34:21.710
So I called my sponsor.

34:21.770 --> 34:23.020
Have a meeting today.

34:23.630 --> 34:24.770
You wanna talk about it?

34:24.850 --> 34:27.840
No,but I guess that's part of the problem.

34:27.960 --> 34:30.449
Sweetheart,can I say something?

34:30.510 --> 34:32.100
What,that living with my mom is okay?

34:32.150 --> 34:33.920
Yes,that,too.

34:35.130 --> 34:37.040
Justin,you're a good person.

34:37.120 --> 34:39.710
You're honest and brave and kind.

34:41.920 --> 34:45.060
Look,I feel like rebecca has only seen this one side of me,

34:45.130 --> 34:48.650
and I'm--I'm terrified that if she sees 
this other side,that she's gonna...

34:48.699 --> 34:50.340
-she'll what? -She's gonna walk.

34:50.389 --> 34:52.880
She's gonna realize that I'm not good enough for her.

34:52.940 --> 34:57.200
You can't pick and choose the parts of yourself 
you want rebecca to see and know.

34:57.260 --> 34:59.430
Shutting her out won't help the relationship.

34:59.510 --> 35:00.510
What will?

35:00.590 --> 35:02.090
Letting her in.

35:06.180 --> 35:09.030
No,no,the guy needs permits to keep animals on his property,

35:09.110 --> 35:13.350
even if they're bees,and he didn't apply 
for one before moving,so there's your angle.

35:13.390 --> 35:16.850
Yeah,or you could call the president.
I'm sure that wouldooork,t.

35:17.050 --> 35:19.180
Uh,senator,I have to go.Bye.

35:21.350 --> 35:24.100
I'm not used to being summoned to an associate's office.

35:24.160 --> 35:25.420
What's so important?

35:25.500 --> 35:27.600
I-I just wanted to talk about last night.

35:27.660 --> 35:29.030
Well,I just got off the phone with ron robinson.

35:29.090 --> 35:30.490
He's faxing over the retainer right now.

35:30.570 --> 35:33.180
Yeah,yeah,he--he called earlier to tell me that.

35:33.240 --> 35:34.640
Then what's the problem?

35:34.700 --> 35:37.960
I wanna make partner here more than you know.

35:38.020 --> 35:40.960
But a few things happened last night 
I don't think I handled well.

35:41.040 --> 35:42.260
Are you kidding me?You handled it perfectly.

35:42.260 --> 35:44.370
You did exactly what you were supposed to do.

35:44.450 --> 35:47.160
You landed the deal.You should be proud.

35:47.450 --> 35:49.900
look,I have a partners' meeting in five minutes,

35:49.980 --> 35:52.990
and I was planning on raving about your performance,so...

35:53.440 --> 35:55.550
if that's all there is...

35:57.260 --> 35:59.030
yes,sir,that's all.

35:59.260 --> 36:00.680
Good.

36:02.210 --> 36:04.290
Keep up the good work.

36:10.760 --> 36:13.390
yeah,all right.
Hey,listen,I gotta go.Bye.

36:13.470 --> 36:15.020
I talked to the project manager,

36:15.090 --> 36:17.800
who says we can start converting the land in a few weeks.

36:17.880 --> 36:19.300
Great.

36:21.220 --> 36:22.460
Listen...

36:22.540 --> 36:25.210
about what happened with saul and sarah--

36:25.270 --> 36:26.540
I'm really sorry.

36:26.610 --> 36:28.180
Are you?

36:28.470 --> 36:30.850
I'm not happy about this.

36:30.930 --> 36:33.200
But,tommy,we did not drive them away.

36:33.300 --> 36:35.020
They chose to go.

36:35.100 --> 36:38.960
Yeah,well,uh,I've been turning a lot ofhings over since then.

36:39.100 --> 36:42.360
However we go about rebranding,
whatever logo or angle we use,

36:42.440 --> 36:45.470
ojai foods will remain "ojai foods.

36:45.960 --> 36:50.680
" But I thought the point was that you wanted to 
reposition their products in the market?

36:50.760 --> 36:54.750
It is,and we will,but under the same name.

36:54.850 --> 36:55.940
Sarah and saul were right.

36:56.020 --> 36:58.910
This company has history.

36:59.160 --> 37:01.310
It needs to be respected.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.110
I hope you don't have a problem with that.

37:05.520 --> 37:08.260
I'll let the board know what you decided.

37:14.290 --> 37:15.690
You're back.

37:16.080 --> 37:17.280
Let me grab this.

37:17.460 --> 37:18.650
Oh,I need food.

37:18.730 --> 37:19.660
I'm starving.

37:19.740 --> 37:22.720
I-I promise you,I am ready to eat my arm.

37:24.590 --> 37:25.750
Did you get any offers?

37:25.910 --> 37:28.200
Just,uh,just,uh,four.

37:29.190 --> 37:30.450
You're kidding.

37:30.590 --> 37:32.350
there's,uh,there's gonna be a bidding war.

37:32.410 --> 37:33.650
That's incredible!

37:33.710 --> 37:36.970
It is kind of incredible,if I do say so myself.

37:37.050 --> 37:38.290
But I-I don't know what I'm gonna do yet,

37:38.370 --> 37:41.370
but I-I do know that you and i need to celebrate.

37:41.450 --> 37:43.080
I have some champagne that I have chilled.

37:43.140 --> 37:44.510
You--you do?

37:44.590 --> 37:47.830
Hey,I have my own triumphs that I wanna celebrate.

37:47.910 --> 37:49.070
Really?

37:49.790 --> 37:50.700
What are they?

37:50.760 --> 37:53.000
The bees,they're gone.

37:53.040 --> 37:54.100
-You're kidding. -No.

37:54.160 --> 37:56.020
Kevin made a call.

37:57.730 --> 38:00.740
Yeah,it turns out that they needed a permi 
or they didn't have it--

38:00.800 --> 38:02.910
what--whatever.It's over.

38:03.480 --> 38:05.910
Well,okay then,here's to kevin.

38:05.990 --> 38:07.330
To kevin.

38:09.360 --> 38:10.460
to jobs we hate.

38:10.530 --> 38:12.090
You're the only one with a job.

38:12.170 --> 38:13.680
Oh,I'm not worried about you,kiddo.

38:13.740 --> 38:15.940
-You're a survivor. 
-So are you.

38:15.980 --> 38:18.150
And I'm sorry about all those things I said.

38:18.220 --> 38:21.300
-no,it's okay. 
-Either of you gonna apologize for firing me?

38:21.480 --> 38:23.630
I know.It was tommy.

38:26.750 --> 38:29.380
It's gonna be so weird not going into ojai.

38:29.480 --> 38:31.250
Mm,tell me about it.

38:31.870 --> 38:33.850
40 years.

38:36.270 --> 38:37.520
okay.

38:38.130 --> 38:39.830
To ojai.

38:39.890 --> 38:41.090
To ojai.

38:41.150 --> 38:42.420
To ojai.

38:53.700 --> 38:55.060
look,I'm sorry.I shouldn't have--

38:55.120 --> 38:56.200
 no,don't,please.

38:56.280 --> 38:58.340
No,I know you don't like to think about it.

38:58.500 --> 39:00.570
Becca,I think about it all the time.

39:03.270 --> 39:05.210
can I,uh,can I come in for a second?

39:05.290 --> 39:06.890
Yeah,of course.

39:15.380 --> 39:17.310
no dana drew,huh?

39:18.010 --> 39:20.160
I wanted comfort food.

39:22.650 --> 39:23.980
I'm sorry.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.280
You don't have to apologize.

39:26.380 --> 39:28.320
I do have to apologize.

39:30.220 --> 39:32.590
I'm gonna call anthony and apologize to him,too.

39:32.690 --> 39:34.100
But I just...

39:34.160 --> 39:36.910
I just wanted to talk to you first.But...

39:36.990 --> 39:39.480
I'm just afraid that you're not gonna like what you hear.

39:40.390 --> 39:41.860
Try me.

39:43.230 --> 39:44.880
All right.So...

39:47.580 --> 39:49.860
last night,when we were at anthony's house and his--

39:49.950 --> 39:55.720
his family is being so nice and--
and treating me like I just saved their son's life,um...

39:57.640 --> 39:59.250
you did.

40:00.290 --> 40:02.050
The entire time I'm looking at anthony,

40:02.110 --> 40:05.290
I just wish I could snap my fingers 
and trade his life for charlie'S.

40:07.200 --> 40:09.030
how ugly is that?

40:10.760 --> 40:12.520
Of course you wanted to save him.He's your friend.

40:12.520 --> 40:15.200
That's not the type of guy charlie was.

40:15.980 --> 40:18.900
He would've taken a bullet for anyone.

40:28.150 --> 40:29.810
W-- where was he from?

40:29.880 --> 40:31.490
He was from boston.

40:34.730 --> 40:36.240
What was he like?

40:39.010 --> 40:41.040
he was a bigude.He was...

40:42.550 --> 40:44.170
he was like an offensiveineman.

40:44.250 --> 40:45.520
no way.

40:45.600 --> 40:48.250
There was this,uh,this group of iraqi kids that...

40:48.490 --> 40:50.590
used to use him like a ride,like disneyland,

40:50.670 --> 40:53.900
you know,they'd just be all over him.

40:53.960 --> 40:57.180
There was this one kid,and we used to--
 we used to call him stretch,
