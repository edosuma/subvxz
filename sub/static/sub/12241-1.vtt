00:27.889 --> 00:29.669
Love.

00:30.890 --> 00:34.459
Love is so complex.

00:34.658 --> 00:38.473
It can either be the greatest
feeling in the world or...

00:38.497 --> 00:40.640
it can cause immense pain,

00:40.664 --> 00:44.692
and usually it's us, people,
who cause that pain

00:44.716 --> 00:49.857
because we're flawed,
dishonest, scared.

00:49.881 --> 00:53.863
Emotional injury can be just as
crippling as physical injury,

00:53.887 --> 00:55.306
disrupting our mood,

00:55.330 --> 01:00.330
productivity and personal interactions
which all leads to more pain.

01:00.354 --> 01:04.223
When left to deal with this trauma
on our own the cycle never ends.

01:04.247 --> 01:05.576
But now,

01:05.600 --> 01:08.547
through the Department
of emotional integrity

01:08.571 --> 01:11.280
we can prevent this
cycle from ever beginning.

01:11.304 --> 01:13.392
The DEI brings structure

01:13.416 --> 01:16.280
to the chaotic mess that
comes with falling in love

01:16.304 --> 01:19.236
by assigning emotional
integrity scores people are

01:19.260 --> 01:20.971
held accountable for their actions

01:20.995 --> 01:23.810
which promotes an
honesty and rationality.

01:23.834 --> 01:26.372
This all leads to higher
productivity in the workplace,

01:26.396 --> 01:27.900
greater financial credibility,

01:27.924 --> 01:29.368
but most importantly,

01:29.392 --> 01:31.491
successful relationships.

01:31.515 --> 01:34.729
Since its establishment,
the DEI has helped

01:34.753 --> 01:36.787
millions of people
in this country.

01:36.811 --> 01:39.955
Our emotional health
and quality of life are

01:39.979 --> 01:46.089
at its highest ever because we can all
finally have confidence in one another.

01:47.272 --> 01:50.734
Now most of you here are
18 years old or very close

01:50.758 --> 01:54.318
which is the legal age to register
relationships with the DEI

01:54.342 --> 01:56.935
Once you're in our
system you'll be given a

01:56.959 --> 01:59.821
neutral emotional
integrity score of 70.

01:59.845 --> 02:04.189
From there it's your responsibility
to increase or decrease it.

02:04.213 --> 02:06.813
Yes. How do you raise
your EI score?

02:06.837 --> 02:11.268
That's a good question.
Does anyone here know?

02:11.292 --> 02:13.082
What are you thinking?

02:13.106 --> 02:16.595
You find a really special
girl you're crazy for,

02:16.619 --> 02:20.059
get registered and
don't let her go.

02:20.083 --> 02:22.774
[students chuckle]

02:22.798 --> 02:25.468
Well that is part of it.
It is true that you can

02:25.492 --> 02:29.294
increase your score by being in a
registered relationship that extends

02:29.318 --> 02:30.839
beyond 12 months.

02:30.863 --> 02:32.257
You can also increase your score

02:32.281 --> 02:36.561
by registering with someone who
has a higher score than you.

02:36.585 --> 02:38.067
Yes.

02:38.091 --> 02:40.813
What does it mean when
other kids call my mom

02:40.837 --> 02:43.906
a score digger?
- It means she's a slut.

02:43.930 --> 02:47.300
Hey now. There is nothing
wrong with being attracted

02:47.324 --> 02:49.524
to individuals with
a higher score.

02:49.548 --> 02:52.949
- Next question? Yes.
- What drops your score?

02:52.973 --> 02:55.123
Well there are a
number of things,

02:55.147 --> 02:57.508
the big one being of
course terminating a

02:57.532 --> 02:58.980
relationship due to infidelity.

02:59.004 --> 03:02.237
Also, registering
with a lower score individual,

03:02.261 --> 03:04.697
terminating before 12 months,

03:04.721 --> 03:09.996
relationship fraud. All the specifics can
be found here in this pamphlet.

03:10.020 --> 03:12.695
Now kids, it's important
for you to remember that

03:12.719 --> 03:16.189
a higher score today means
a happier tomorrow.

03:16.213 --> 03:19.345
I've seen a lot of people your
age throw caution to the wind.

03:19.369 --> 03:20.964
They didn't take their
score seriously.

03:20.988 --> 03:24.600
And trust me, it's
never pretty sight.

03:28.971 --> 03:30.332
Wow!

03:30.356 --> 03:32.585
Wow, these are really,
really great Ben!

03:32.609 --> 03:35.521
This is interesting, you worked as a
programmer for a little while.

03:35.545 --> 03:38.665
I just needed some
stability, health care.

03:38.689 --> 03:41.281
Honestly this is some
strong work.

03:41.305 --> 03:42.386
Thanks.

03:42.410 --> 03:45.885
Here's the thing. We're not only
looking for someone with a strong eye,

03:45.909 --> 03:48.810
we're also looking for someone who
has great communication skills,

03:48.834 --> 03:50.155
and works well on a team.

03:50.179 --> 03:51.830
I, I agree

03:51.854 --> 03:56.858
which brings me to our
next point, your EI score.

03:59.511 --> 04:02.604
Here origin we have a minimum
EI score requirement for all

04:02.628 --> 04:04.154
incoming employees.

04:04.178 --> 04:06.603
I know my score is a
little on the low side.

04:06.627 --> 04:09.418
Unfortunately it is below the minimum.

04:09.442 --> 04:12.343
Which I, I assure you is just a mistake.

04:12.367 --> 04:16.736
If it is just a mistake, we'll
give you some time to clear it up,

04:16.760 --> 04:18.748
but really only after
that can we

04:18.772 --> 04:21.653
have a serious talk you
joining Origin.

04:23.182 --> 04:24.409
[phone chimes]

04:24.433 --> 04:27.663
<i>A DEI representative will
be with you shortly.</i>

04:27.687 --> 04:30.883
<i>Did you know that individuals with
higher emotional integrity scores</i>

04:30.907 --> 04:33.167
<i>are less likely to
suffer from depression,</i>

04:33.191 --> 04:37.038
<i>anxiety, and other mental illnesses.</i>
- Great.

04:37.062 --> 04:40.794
<i>Remember, if you want to
know more, check their score.</i>

04:40.818 --> 04:42.594
<i>Thank you for holding, how can I help you?</i>

04:42.618 --> 04:44.143
Hi, um,

04:44.167 --> 04:46.692
I'm calling because I think you
guys might have made a mistake

04:46.716 --> 04:48.586
on my EI score.

04:48.610 --> 04:49.863
<i>Please hold.</i>

04:49.887 --> 05:08.589
♪ <i>Take It as It Comes</i> by
Imaginary Future playing ♪

05:16.513 --> 05:19.294
So, based on everything
you've shared with me

05:19.318 --> 05:22.160
I recommend this
business line of credit.

05:22.184 --> 05:23.173
Okay.

05:23.197 --> 05:25.894
Do I have permission to run
your credit and EI scores?

05:25.918 --> 05:27.738
Yeah, of course.

05:32.632 --> 05:35.592
So, what's the
name of your café?

05:35.616 --> 05:38.445
Put this cookie in
your mouth right now.

05:38.469 --> 05:40.531
Really?

05:40.555 --> 05:44.412
No, its called "Friends
In Flour".

05:44.436 --> 05:46.401
I like that one much better.

05:46.425 --> 05:48.616
It was a bad joke but...

05:48.640 --> 05:52.267
how many years have you been operating
or is this a brand new entity?

05:52.291 --> 05:53.510
Brand new.

05:53.534 --> 05:55.268
Congrats.

05:55.292 --> 05:57.498
Okay, well it looks like your

05:57.522 --> 06:00.736
credit history is just
slightly above average.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.582
I racked up a little debt while
I was in culinary school.

06:07.848 --> 06:10.950
Your EI score is actually
pretty good.

06:12.147 --> 06:14.307
So based on these

06:14.331 --> 06:17.916
I am glad to let you know that you've
been approved for a business loan.

06:17.940 --> 06:20.071
- Really?
- Um, hmm.

06:20.095 --> 06:21.967
- Thank you.
- Congrats.

06:21.991 --> 06:23.982
Thank you so much!

06:38.311 --> 06:39.812
[whispering?] I got it. or I'm done.

06:39.836 --> 06:41.247
You got it? or Is that it?

06:41.271 --> 06:43.148
I. Am. Finished.

06:43.172 --> 06:46.602
That is part two of
your birthday gift.

06:46.626 --> 06:48.599
[Chuckles] Wow!

06:48.623 --> 06:51.414
Yeah, see look now
when you get into SFU

06:51.438 --> 06:52.887
you're going to be
ready for that cold.

06:52.911 --> 06:54.959
Okay, first, -IF- I get in.

06:54.983 --> 06:57.437
And second, it's not that
cold in San Francisco.

06:58.561 --> 07:01.109
Wait, is it?

07:01.133 --> 07:02.330
I don't know.

07:02.713 --> 07:04.935
I can't believe you made this.

07:04.959 --> 07:09.271
And that you think my
hands are this big.

07:09.295 --> 07:11.621
[Both laugh]

07:13.313 --> 07:18.825
Yeah, actually the first one was
way worse, look at this. Wa Pow!

07:18.849 --> 07:23.047
No, no, no, no, no, it's perfect...
um...

07:23.071 --> 07:25.230
for when I need to chew
off one of my fingers.

07:25.254 --> 07:26.117
Mmm.

07:26.141 --> 07:28.054
- Question though.
- Yeah.

07:28.078 --> 07:29.358
Where is the other one?

07:30.210 --> 07:36.047
Well, I'm still working on it. But...

07:36.071 --> 07:40.791
I realize that a girl like you
only needs one glove really.

07:42.496 --> 07:46.146
Well, what about my other hand?

07:52.062 --> 07:53.281
That works, right?

07:54.915 --> 07:57.024
Yeah, that works.

08:02.314 --> 08:04.473
Is she leaving?

08:04.497 --> 08:08.710
- We just got here!
- She said she's not feeling well.

08:08.734 --> 08:12.745
Uh, honey, I love you; but
did you say something?

08:12.769 --> 08:14.744
Of course not, she just...

08:15.705 --> 08:18.210
she got the sense
tonight may be a set up

08:18.234 --> 08:19.562
so she looked up Ben's score.

08:19.812 --> 08:21.332
Oh my God!

08:21.356 --> 08:23.625
Did you tell her that he's our best friend?

08:23.649 --> 08:24.332
Your best friend.

08:24.356 --> 08:27.211
Did you tell her that he's a great
guy and there's a good explanation

08:27.235 --> 08:29.526
for his score? All right,
he was a top programmer

08:29.550 --> 08:30.738
and he's working at Origin now!

08:30.762 --> 08:33.123
Technically I'm still in
the application phase...

08:33.147 --> 08:35.722
don't have a job yet.

08:36.426 --> 08:40.216
Sorry, Ben. I didn't
realize you could hear us.

08:40.240 --> 08:45.483
She just, she's a plus 80 and she said
she doesn't have time for a sub 40.

08:45.507 --> 08:47.230
God this is so awkward.

08:47.254 --> 08:48.121
I'm totally fine.

08:48.145 --> 08:49.249
I meant for me.

08:49.273 --> 08:51.000
Don't feel bad.

08:51.024 --> 08:52.496
It's not you, it's your score.

08:52.520 --> 08:53.599
Okay.

08:53.623 --> 08:55.415
Actually I know
how true that is.

08:55.439 --> 08:56.617
You just...

08:56.641 --> 09:00.148
You need to fix your score Ben.
You're an adult now.

09:03.351 --> 09:05.127
I'm sorry it didn't work out man.

09:05.151 --> 09:08.362
I am totally fine it just
means she's not right for me.

09:08.386 --> 09:09.614
Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa.

09:09.638 --> 09:12.211
Not right for you?
Are you kidding me?

09:12.235 --> 09:14.940
- Her EI score is 82.
- Wow

09:14.964 --> 09:18.053
Dating someone like her for a year
will up your score by like 50%.

09:18.077 --> 09:21.920
Okay, but she has apparently already
decided that I am not worthy.

09:22.650 --> 09:25.801
Ben, why are you doing
this to yourself man?

09:25.825 --> 09:30.068
Look at Sandy and I. When we both turned
18 we did everything the right way, Okay?

09:30.092 --> 09:33.985
We followed all the rules, we filed the
proper paperwork and what did that lead to?

09:34.009 --> 09:36.138
I think when you guys
have is so nice.

09:36.162 --> 09:39.398
Both of us being a plus 80's
when our paths finally crossed.

09:39.422 --> 09:42.173
Can you imagine what you have
done if I screwed around

09:42.197 --> 09:47.022
when and I was a sub 60 or 50 when
we met? She would have blown me off.

09:47.046 --> 09:48.744
But look at us now. Right?

09:48.768 --> 09:50.357
We're both plus 90s.

09:50.381 --> 09:54.846
We have a great healthy relationship.
Don't you want that for yourself?

09:54.870 --> 09:58.240
Just make an appointment at the DEI.

10:00.856 --> 10:03.578
Oh, honey, I'm home.

10:03.602 --> 10:06.261
Hey, where you been?

10:06.285 --> 10:11.744
Uh, sorry, me and the guys
met at the happy hour and yep.

10:11.768 --> 10:17.045
Nice! Well I was just trying
to call to let you know that I um..

10:17.330 --> 10:18.977
I got the loan.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.087
Dude..

10:21.111 --> 10:22.120
I know!

10:22.144 --> 10:24.333
I told you it would work out!

10:24.357 --> 10:28.212
Yes. Sir. That is why I...

10:28.236 --> 10:34.408
got you some
beautiful croissants.

10:34.432 --> 10:37.085
Those are apple pie cookies.

10:37.109 --> 10:39.495
Yes, yes they are.

10:39.519 --> 10:40.546
Would you like one?

10:40.570 --> 10:42.647
I'm good but please help yourself.

10:42.671 --> 10:45.684
Okay, I'm celebratin', I'm celebratin'.

10:45.708 --> 10:48.245
Whenever you want to celebrate
with me, I brought one for you.

10:48.269 --> 10:50.078
Thank you!

10:51.388 --> 10:55.005
[phone vibrates]

10:55.410 --> 10:58.407
[phone ringing]

10:58.431 --> 10:59.104
Ben?

10:59.128 --> 11:03.114
Heh, heh, heh, uh, Sarah.

11:03.138 --> 11:05.352
How are you?

11:05.376 --> 11:10.199
Um, good uh sorry I
just... it's been so long

11:10.223 --> 11:12.178
I thought maybe you
called me by accident.

11:12.202 --> 11:16.129
Huh. Believe it or not, I
still have not met another...

11:16.153 --> 11:19.584
Sarah since you.

11:21.125 --> 11:22.968
It's been a while, huh?

11:25.814 --> 11:29.266
<i>Um, actually If you're busy I
can call back another time.</i>

11:29.290 --> 11:33.307
No, its fine. I'm just um
working on a menu.

11:34.201 --> 11:35.859
<i>Oh, for what?</i>

11:35.883 --> 11:39.492
I'm in the process
of opening up a café.

11:39.516 --> 11:41.578
That's... amazing.

11:41.602 --> 11:43.870
That's always been your dream.

11:44.635 --> 11:46.805
Congrats.

11:46.829 --> 11:48.097
Thanks.

11:48.433 --> 11:52.114
I actually that's,
that's why I'm calling

11:52.138 --> 11:56.006
<i>Did you know that we filed
conflicting termination reports?</i>

11:56.030 --> 12:00.639
So, uh, it's giving me a
red flag on my record.

12:00.663 --> 12:02.564
<i>I don't know if you
had the same problem.</i>

12:02.588 --> 12:07.548
For a little while, but I started
dating someone so it kind of...

12:07.572 --> 12:11.932
Right, yeah. Look that's really great.

12:11.956 --> 12:18.041
Well mine never improved and
uh I'm up for this job.

12:18.065 --> 12:20.067
So what you need from me?

12:20.091 --> 12:26.525
Uh, would you be uh free sometime this
week to go down to the DEI with me and um.

12:26.549 --> 12:30.981
They need us to be there in
person to work out the details?

12:31.005 --> 12:33.994
I mean I'm pretty
busy lately Ben,

12:34.018 --> 12:36.425
I've got the contractors
coming this week.

12:36.449 --> 12:40.570
I can set up the appointment
it'll only take about an hour.

12:40.594 --> 12:43.758
[she sighs]

12:43.891 --> 12:46.707
I'm sorry to be bringing
up the past but...

12:47.703 --> 12:52.339
I really need this... <i>please.</i>

12:55.572 --> 12:58.899
Uh, Thursday, late afternoon,

12:58.923 --> 13:00.398
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

13:00.422 --> 13:01.814
Alright I'll see you there.

13:50.704 --> 13:53.082
Oh man even Melissa didn't get in.

13:53.106 --> 13:55.507
She's like the smartest
person I know.

13:55.531 --> 13:58.879
Don't even worry about it
she's book smart you're...

13:58.903 --> 14:00.355

14:05.835 --> 14:07.644
Alright so you ready?

14:07.668 --> 14:11.580
Yeah no, ugh, I don't
know okay you go first.

14:11.604 --> 14:13.622
We promise we do
at the same time.

14:16.070 --> 14:17.023
Okay.

14:18.643 --> 14:21.454
Can you believe they actually
used to do this by mail?

14:21.478 --> 14:24.198
What if we don't get in?

14:24.222 --> 14:27.465
What? No stop.

14:27.489 --> 14:29.113
Be fine okay?

14:29.296 --> 14:30.026
Promise?

14:30.050 --> 14:32.083
Yeah, trust me.

14:32.279 --> 14:33.445
Okay.

14:34.806 --> 14:35.813
[deep breath]

14:35.837 --> 14:37.428
- On the count of three, Okay?
- Okay.

14:37.452 --> 14:37.983
One.

14:38.007 --> 14:38.731
Two.

14:38.755 --> 14:39.997

15:40.515 --> 15:41.486
Ben.

15:44.598 --> 15:46.317
I'm sorry, can you...

15:46.530 --> 15:47.531
I'm sorry I'm late.

15:47.555 --> 15:49.765
Yeah, um [clears throat].

15:52.020 --> 15:55.184
I guess technically
we're both a year late.

15:55.778 --> 15:57.082
Yeah, right.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.336
Thanks for coming.

16:01.516 --> 16:02.422
Sure.

16:04.848 --> 16:07.598
So what's this new job
you have on the line.

16:08.325 --> 16:09.750
Um.

16:09.774 --> 16:12.811
I have an opportunity
at a design firm.

16:13.492 --> 16:15.038
Cool, programming?

16:16.362 --> 16:18.058
Designing, actually.

16:18.082 --> 16:20.961
<i>Now serving 18 A.</i>

16:21.071 --> 16:21.915
Wow!

16:23.102 --> 16:26.575
Well it's good. You always
talked about pursuing that.

16:26.599 --> 16:32.937
Yeah. Talked too much
so I finally go for it.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.935
Are you sure that you
want to do this?

16:42.252 --> 16:43.549
I'm sorry.

16:44.335 --> 16:45.438
I just...

16:45.462 --> 16:48.767
I don't think that I'm going
to ever find anybody like you.

16:48.791 --> 16:51.072
May I interrupt you?

16:51.364 --> 16:53.685
Um, I think I heard enough.

16:53.709 --> 16:56.765
Uh, Mr. Fischer, Mr. Bradley, uh

16:56.789 --> 16:59.776
Thank you for doing your best
to recount your relationship.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.989
I know situations
like this can be

17:03.013 --> 17:06.701
difficult to look at with a clear head and
a clear heart and that's why I'm here.

17:06.724 --> 17:13.184
So based on your testimonies I
am assigning Clint 76% fault

17:13.208 --> 17:14.412
and the remainder to Scott.

17:14.435 --> 17:14.964
But!?

17:14.989 --> 17:20.148
Mr. Bradley, you will most likely find
love with someone else so don't worry.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.098
Thank you.

17:21.122 --> 17:22.098
You're welcome.

17:22.122 --> 17:27.580
Mr. Fisher. That's a nice jacket.

17:27.605 --> 17:29.288
Oh I can't believe this.

17:29.312 --> 17:30.000
Thank you.

17:30.024 --> 17:34.111
Confirmation reports will
be sent to you soon.

17:35.809 --> 17:37.730

17:40.184 --> 17:41.942
[door opens with squeak]

17:44.800 --> 17:45.450
Hello.

17:45.474 --> 17:46.082
Hi.

17:48.515 --> 17:49.472
[door closes]

17:49.496 --> 17:51.081
How can I help you.

17:51.374 --> 17:57.032
Yeah, we were in a relationship that
ended a little over a year ago.

17:57.056 --> 17:57.747
Okay.

17:57.771 --> 18:00.942
We submitted termination
reports that we didn't...

18:00.966 --> 18:03.577
exactly sign off
with each other.

18:03.601 --> 18:09.157
Okay, well let's look at
your relationship history.

18:09.181 --> 18:12.636
So you were in a registered
relationship for three years...

18:12.660 --> 18:15.932
You had high numbers in all
relationship categories.

18:15.956 --> 18:19.045
Started to dip towards
the end there.

18:19.069 --> 18:25.322
And you both submitted termination
reports that didn't match.

18:25.346 --> 18:27.099
- Right.
- Right.

18:27.123 --> 18:32.549
As you know termination reports
must state the same reasons

18:32.573 --> 18:36.113
and be signed off by both parties.
This is common knowledge.

18:36.137 --> 18:36.956
Yeah.

18:37.471 --> 18:39.034
That's right.

18:40.753 --> 18:45.592
Uh, Ben, you reported that
Sarah was at full fault

18:45.616 --> 18:48.104
for the termination
due to infidelity.

18:48.128 --> 18:52.516
Wait, um. We're not, we're not
gonna go with your report are we?

18:52.952 --> 18:55.023
Yeah.

18:55.225 --> 18:56.977
I thought.

18:57.001 --> 19:00.488
Ben that's ridiculous. You
know that's not what happened.

19:00.512 --> 19:02.742
With Peter?

19:02.766 --> 19:04.234
Who's Peter?

19:04.258 --> 19:06.113
Touchy, handsy Peter?

19:06.137 --> 19:08.574
The "I like to touch things
with my hands I'm a chef"?

19:08.598 --> 19:13.062
Peter was a classmate nothing happened.
I've told you this over and over again Ben.

19:13.086 --> 19:14.374
A kiss is nothing?

19:14.398 --> 19:15.716
You kissed Peter?

19:15.740 --> 19:19.071
Okay if you want to go there what
about you and what's her face?

19:19.095 --> 19:20.618
Okay, we're going to
go with my report.

19:20.642 --> 19:22.629
That is the definition
of nothing happened.

19:22.653 --> 19:24.080
Debbie is one of my best friends.

19:24.104 --> 19:26.660
We were close before you and I ever
started dating. You knew that.

19:26.684 --> 19:28.051
You spent the night!

19:28.075 --> 19:29.657
Yeah, that's very inappropriate.

19:29.681 --> 19:32.356
You kicked me-she kicked me out.

19:32.380 --> 19:36.060
What is going on? I thought that
we were gonna settle this today!

19:36.084 --> 19:38.683
I'm not gonna sign off on
something that's not true.

19:38.707 --> 19:41.985
Ben, that would drop my score so
low I'd lose the loan on my café.

19:42.009 --> 19:46.414
I am up for an actual
job, not some pipe dream!

19:50.875 --> 19:52.274
- I'm sorry.
- Wow!

19:52.298 --> 19:56.178
No, that's fine I don't need this.
My score is fine.

19:56.202 --> 19:58.120
- I'm sorry.
- Good luck Ben.

19:58.144 --> 19:59.134
I...

[door opens]

20:01.525 --> 20:02.830

20:05.934 --> 20:07.348

20:19.370 --> 20:20.248
Sarah!

20:20.272 --> 20:22.616
Sarah, wait!

20:23.046 --> 20:24.663
No, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no!

20:24.687 --> 20:28.197
I'm not lettin' go, come on! Please,
please, please come back inside!

[window rolling down]

20:35.296 --> 20:35.936
Please!

20:35.960 --> 20:38.154
Just come back inside.

20:40.218 --> 20:41.734
Get in.

20:41.984 --> 20:43.646
Where are you going?

20:43.670 --> 20:46.629
Get in the car Ben.

20:47.804 --> 20:48.648
Is it in park?

20:48.672 --> 20:50.242
- Get in the car!
- Okay, all right.

20:53.098 --> 20:56.099
<i>Now serving 20 B.</i>

20:56.123 --> 20:59.574
Well, it's nice to see such a
young couple like you guys.

20:59.598 --> 21:01.065
We're really excited!

21:01.917 --> 21:07.253
Um, so Haley. Uh, you will be attending
college up North this coming year...

21:07.277 --> 21:09.439
And Seth, you will
be here in LA?

21:09.463 --> 21:12.486
We actually applied to the same school
but I, I just can't keep up with her.

21:12.510 --> 21:14.935
Uh, Is this your first long
distance relationship?

21:14.959 --> 21:19.533
Yeah, this is actually both of
our first real relationship period.

21:19.557 --> 21:20.779
Really?

21:20.803 --> 21:23.367
Um. Okay.

21:23.391 --> 21:25.746
Well you know relationships...

21:25.770 --> 21:31.575
are tough but long distance relationships
have their own unique set of challenges.

21:31.599 --> 21:33.697
This is not a light decision.

21:33.721 --> 21:35.969
That's what everyone keeps telling us.

21:35.993 --> 21:38.946
So, are you sure you want to proceed?

21:39.130 --> 21:41.616
Yeah, well we know that
in order to get married,

21:41.640 --> 21:43.849
a relationship has
to be registered for

21:43.873 --> 21:48.470
a minimum of one year. Right? So,
we just want to get a head start.

21:48.494 --> 21:50.685
Nice. You know your stuff.

21:50.709 --> 21:52.878
But just so you know.

21:52.902 --> 21:56.318
Statistically couples
with more life experience

21:56.342 --> 21:59.387
have a lot better chance at
actually getting married.

21:59.411 --> 22:03.859
Yeah but I love her. So isn't
that all that matters?

22:03.883 --> 22:06.924
Plus, like why can't
we be the exception?

22:08.379 --> 22:10.554
Okay, just making sure.

22:10.578 --> 22:17.506
Um, here is a pamphlet with tips on
maintaining a long-distance relationship.

22:17.530 --> 22:22.385
Make sure you read that thoroughly.
Okay. Like thoroughly.

22:22.409 --> 22:23.155
Okay.

22:23.179 --> 22:24.395
Okay?

22:24.419 --> 22:28.445
Your relationship registration
will process in a couple of days.

22:28.469 --> 22:30.675
Congratulations, you are official.

22:30.699 --> 22:32.976
- Okay.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.162

Hey!

22:38.596 --> 22:40.221
Yeah?

22:40.245 --> 22:43.038
You told him that you love me.

22:43.062 --> 22:47.112
Yeah. Is that okay?

22:47.136 --> 22:49.666
Do you really?

22:50.053 --> 22:51.974
Yeah.

22:54.459 --> 22:56.405

23:06.611 --> 23:08.033
[kissing sound]

23:10.922 --> 23:12.525
Ben we're too old for this.

23:12.549 --> 23:16.447
We owe each other
honesty at least.

23:16.471 --> 23:18.951
Why do you think we broke up?

23:33.322 --> 23:36.635
Yes I knew that Peter
had feelings for me.

23:36.659 --> 23:39.693
And yes I kissed him. But...

23:39.717 --> 23:45.453
It was a tough time for
me with school and...

23:45.477 --> 23:51.587
we were falling apart and I was
weak and I made a stupid mistake.

23:53.583 --> 23:57.233
I just think back to those last six
months and all of those fights

23:57.257 --> 23:58.695
and and and about Peter

23:58.719 --> 23:59.951
and your new schedule.

23:59.975 --> 24:02.896
That wasn't all that was about. It
was about you and Debbie and and you

24:02.920 --> 24:04.724
I just stopped trying...

24:06.049 --> 24:07.861
With us.

24:11.006 --> 24:14.068
It's easier to blame
someone else than...

24:14.467 --> 24:17.654
admit your own faults.

24:24.835 --> 24:27.101
You see that?

24:29.242 --> 24:31.446
That's gonna be my new café.

24:34.503 --> 24:36.714
You're short a couple of walls.

24:37.696 --> 24:40.335
[both laugh]

24:40.359 --> 24:42.624
As long as this whole...

24:42.955 --> 24:46.440
reassessment doesn't
mess with things...

24:47.559 --> 24:49.551
I'll help you.

24:50.184 --> 24:52.074
I know how important
this is to you.

24:52.098 --> 24:56.329
And I will not let our past
selves screw everything up.

24:57.879 --> 25:00.949
They really had no idea
what they were doing.

25:12.160 --> 25:16.226
Okay, so you have
both signed off on

25:16.250 --> 25:17.695
50-50 responsibility.

25:17.719 --> 25:20.490
This should significantly
help both of your scores.

25:20.514 --> 25:23.162
The changes should appear on your
records within a day or two.

25:23.186 --> 25:26.698
We did it! Have a nice day.

25:31.428 --> 25:32.521
Hey are you hungry?

25:32.545 --> 25:33.935
You want to grab a bite?

25:33.959 --> 25:38.051
Oh, I've got to go home and check on the
contractors and Jeremy and I have plans.

25:38.075 --> 25:39.153
Right.

25:40.295 --> 25:41.709
It was good to see you.

25:42.659 --> 25:43.765
Yeah.

25:43.789 --> 25:47.455
I'm really glad to hear that
things are going well for you.

25:47.479 --> 25:49.088
Thanks.

25:50.057 --> 25:51.940
Hug.
[chuckles]

25:55.746 --> 25:57.236
You know what? Um.

25:57.260 --> 26:00.966
If all goes as planned I'm hoping
to have a soft opening in the fall.

26:00.990 --> 26:03.018
You should come by.

26:04.014 --> 26:06.185
Will you be there?

26:06.209 --> 26:08.086
Uh. Yes.

26:08.110 --> 26:12.079
Oh, well then... count me in.

26:12.103 --> 26:13.126
Okay cool!

26:13.150 --> 26:16.611
Um, I'll send you details
as it gets closer.

26:16.635 --> 26:17.745
Sounds good.

26:19.479 --> 26:20.638
I'm that way.

26:20.997 --> 26:22.795
Yeah, I'm over here.

26:22.819 --> 26:24.073
Okay.

28:31.829 --> 28:33.314
I'm proud of you man.

28:33.338 --> 28:34.611
I really am.

28:34.635 --> 28:37.878
I mean it takes balls to go to after
what you're passionate about.

28:37.902 --> 28:40.567
When are you going to do
the same for your passion?

28:40.591 --> 28:41.233
Whoop!

28:41.257 --> 28:44.591
All come on. Computer programming
is my passion you dick.

28:45.791 --> 28:48.932
Hey Ben. I'm gonna head out do
you have the Spencer account?

28:48.956 --> 28:51.418
Ooh, sorry.

28:51.442 --> 28:54.332
Oh okay. So you're trying to get
me fired is what you're doing.

28:54.356 --> 28:57.147
Ahh, you're doing pretty
good job there by yourself.

28:57.171 --> 28:59.405
Oh. Ouch!

28:59.429 --> 29:00.752
Hey move man.

29:00.924 --> 29:02.995
[both chuckle]

29:03.019 --> 29:04.190
I'm Henry.

29:04.214 --> 29:05.378
Anna.

29:05.402 --> 29:08.049
I'm sort of the reason
Ben's at this job

29:08.073 --> 29:11.027
That is definitely not true.

29:11.051 --> 29:11.762
I thought so. All right.

29:11.786 --> 29:13.838
[clears throat] Well
you're both welcome.

29:14.130 --> 29:16.670
Oh, what are you still doing here?
I thought you had plans tonight.

29:16.694 --> 29:19.996
Uh. Yeah. We are
gonna go to Lupe.

29:20.020 --> 29:21.154
Luma.

29:21.178 --> 29:22.199
Luma.

29:22.586 --> 29:24.187
You should join.

29:24.443 --> 29:27.195
Oh, um, I'm actually hanging out
with my girlfriends tonight.

29:27.219 --> 29:28.305
She's hanging out with her…

29:28.329 --> 29:30.333
Bring them! We like people.

29:30.357 --> 29:34.046
Um. That place is a plus 80.
Right?

29:34.070 --> 29:35.024
Yeah.

29:35.187 --> 29:37.370
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna work.

29:37.394 --> 29:40.404
I mean some of the girls
are not quite up there.

29:41.363 --> 29:42.926
I totally understand that.

29:42.950 --> 29:45.062
This guy used to be that guy.

29:45.086 --> 29:48.207
- Okay hey so.
- Yeah, well um.

29:48.231 --> 29:50.886
Maybe I'll catch you after
I hang out with them.

29:50.910 --> 29:54.171
Uh, yeah. Cool.

29:54.195 --> 29:55.749
Let me know.

29:55.773 --> 29:59.328
- Okay. Bye.
- See you later.

29:59.352 --> 30:04.384
[mockingly] Yeah cool just let me know.

30:04.408 --> 30:06.401
What's going on here?

30:06.425 --> 30:08.456
I was being charming!

30:08.480 --> 30:10.841
- Okay. When are you going to ask her out?
- What?

30:10.865 --> 30:13.769
- You're not feeling the heat?
- You're wearing a sweater.

30:13.793 --> 30:15.394
She was totally into you!

30:15.418 --> 30:16.839
She's a plus 80!?

30:16.863 --> 30:19.527
I mean that is exactly
what you need!

30:19.551 --> 30:22.777
So any girl with a hint of interest
with a good score is my type?

30:22.801 --> 30:25.728
I didn't say your type I
said exactly what you need.

30:25.752 --> 30:29.363
I mean she's cute. She's in your line of work.
I don’t know, maybe she's your type too.

30:29.387 --> 30:32.307
Whatever it is, you
managed to make it weird.

30:43.696 --> 30:46.017
- Sorry man.
- Come on man.

30:46.041 --> 30:48.618
All my friends are in there.
You can't make an exception?

30:48.642 --> 30:49.963
80's and above, buddy.

30:49.987 --> 30:53.067
I'm a 73 bro, come on.

30:53.091 --> 30:55.748
There's a sub 60 place
around the corner.

30:55.772 --> 30:59.744
Yeah, I know. I was just there.
Your mom says "Hi", bitch.

30:59.768 --> 31:02.899
- Your hair look stupid.
- Come on.

31:06.813 --> 31:11.781
Cool. You're good.

31:19.623 --> 31:24.649
[tablet bleeping]
- You're good.

31:36.899 --> 31:39.220
Oh my God! Do you
remember Diane?

31:39.244 --> 31:40.834
- Uh.
- From accounting.
- Yes.

31:40.858 --> 31:44.181
- Weird hair?
- Uh, yeah with [unintelligible]
- Yes exactly.

31:44.205 --> 31:47.974
They caught her eating a piece
of old cake out of the trashcan.

31:47.998 --> 31:49.392
I miss you at work!

31:49.416 --> 31:51.329
I do not miss that place!

31:51.353 --> 31:54.385
[chuckles] Well I love this place
and I love that you're here.

31:54.800 --> 31:58.692
Yeah, this place is so... cool.

31:58.716 --> 31:59.391
Yeah, it just...

31:59.415 --> 32:02.979
It's awesome. Right? Knowing that
everyone here is a quality person.

32:03.003 --> 32:04.395
I don't know man. You're here.

32:04.419 --> 32:07.284
Okay, these people are
not even on my level!

32:07.308 --> 32:10.882
- Nobody is. Hey, thank you.
- Um-hm.

32:10.906 --> 32:14.692
Um... Here is to...

32:14.716 --> 32:17.071
- Movin' up.
- Movin' up.
[glasses clink]

32:17.095 --> 32:18.304
Congrats man.

32:19.012 --> 32:19.927
Mmm!

32:19.951 --> 32:21.284
Let me get you another one.

32:21.308 --> 32:22.927
- We shall celebrate.
- [Unintelligible] It's my round.

32:22.951 --> 32:24.277
Oh, whatever.

32:28.249 --> 32:29.546
Isn't that Anna?

32:31.786 --> 32:34.599
- Yeah.
- She ditched her friends for you.

32:34.623 --> 32:38.670
- And she's in a... she's in a dress.
- Okay, alright, I'm gonna go talk to her.

32:38.694 --> 32:43.924
- Uh, do you want something from the...?
- I want nothing. Ditch me. Ditch me!

32:48.350 --> 32:49.445
Anna.

32:49.469 --> 32:51.710
- Hi!
- Hey.

32:51.734 --> 32:53.909
Uh, what happened to
girl's night out?

32:53.933 --> 32:57.444
Oh, um, they decided to
go to some sub 40 place.

32:57.468 --> 33:00.527
It's like, they're my friends but I
don't even know why I bother sometimes.

33:00.551 --> 33:02.551
Those places are such
a waste of time.

33:02.575 --> 33:05.622
Oh, but we have the cream
of the crop here. Right?

33:05.646 --> 33:08.499
Well.. Obviously.

33:12.751 --> 33:13.965
Hey... Um....

33:13.989 --> 33:17.073
I'm really glad you're
working at Origin now.

33:17.941 --> 33:19.317
Me too.

33:19.341 --> 33:21.789
And I'm happy we got to meet.

33:23.535 --> 33:26.061
Yeah, I am too.
[chuckles]

33:26.085 --> 33:27.156
[glasses clink]

33:38.638 --> 33:40.124
- Hi!
- Hey!

33:40.148 --> 33:42.041
How's the weather up there?

33:42.065 --> 33:44.519
It's kinda nice.
Wanna check it out?

33:44.543 --> 33:46.485
Yeah!

33:47.448 --> 33:49.262
Alright, so...

33:49.286 --> 33:51.446
Looks like we're all packed up.

33:51.470 --> 33:52.694
Ready?

33:52.913 --> 33:54.515
Yeah.

33:57.706 --> 33:59.793
I'm gonna miss you.

33:59.817 --> 34:01.522
Ah, don't worry about it.

34:01.546 --> 34:03.407
We have a plan. Remember?

34:03.431 --> 34:05.522
I'll be up in a few weeks.

34:05.931 --> 34:08.556
And you promise we'll
video chat every day?

34:08.806 --> 34:10.347
Every day.

34:10.371 --> 34:15.166
Unless you intend on, um, running off to a
frat party to go get drunk or whatever.

34:15.190 --> 34:16.831
I'm not!

34:16.856 --> 34:19.649
I'm purposely not gonna have
a life outside of class.

34:19.672 --> 34:22.183
I'm just gonna study and
talk to you and that's it.

34:22.206 --> 34:26.594
So you're gonna be that weird, creepy girl
in the dorms that never leaves her room?

34:26.618 --> 34:27.717
[laughs]

34:27.741 --> 34:30.114
I'll be that girl... For you.

34:30.139 --> 34:31.255
[kissing]

34:35.677 --> 34:37.293
I love you.

34:38.420 --> 34:40.053
I love you too.

34:40.578 --> 34:41.851
Forever?

34:42.078 --> 34:43.344
Forever.

34:59.070 --> 35:00.818
So have you baked
your entire life?

35:00.842 --> 35:04.175
Since I was a little girl maybe. The apple
pies actually are my grandma's recipe.

35:04.199 --> 35:04.624
Really?

35:04.648 --> 35:07.896
That's why their super tasty. I just
kinda doctor them a little bit.

35:09.999 --> 35:13.026
- Um, excuse me one moment.
Thank you so much for coming.
- Sure.

35:13.050 --> 35:15.650
Um... You made it!

35:15.674 --> 35:17.689
Yeah.

35:17.713 --> 35:21.138
This place is... finished.

35:21.162 --> 35:24.711
Yeah. It's amazing what can
happen in four months.

35:24.735 --> 35:27.147
[chuckles]
It looks great.

35:27.171 --> 35:28.449
Thank you.

35:28.473 --> 35:31.340
Babe, this place is so cute!

35:31.364 --> 35:32.668
Yeah. Isn't it?

35:32.692 --> 35:35.676
Oh Anna, this is Sarah. Sarah
this is my girlfriend Anna.

35:35.700 --> 35:38.230
Hi! It's so nice to meet you.

35:38.254 --> 35:40.950
Nice to meet you.
Congratulations on the café.

35:40.974 --> 35:44.482
Ben's been saying it's a longtime
dream of yours. That is so awesome!

35:44.506 --> 35:46.400
Thank you. It has been.

35:46.424 --> 35:49.931
Oh! There's a bar. Oh, that's so cute.
I'm gonna grab something.

35:49.955 --> 35:52.191
- Babe, what do you want?
- Uh. B-beer.

35:52.716 --> 35:56.083
Beer? Don't you think wine's a
little bit more appropriate?

35:57.145 --> 36:00.357
[both together slowly]
Uh, yes.

36:00.381 --> 36:01.623
Okay I'll be back.

36:04.171 --> 36:06.976
- She seems fun.
- Yeah, she's sweet.

36:07.166 --> 36:09.300
Oh. So where's your boyfriend?

36:09.324 --> 36:11.807
Oh, we split up a few months ago

36:11.831 --> 36:15.665
- Oh. Uh. Sorry.
- Totally fine.

36:17.235 --> 36:19.300
Have you tried anything yet?

36:19.324 --> 36:22.067
- Uh, no.
- Follow me.

36:23.666 --> 36:26.834
- These are yet to be named.
- Wait, what are these?

36:26.858 --> 36:28.869
- Cranapple oatmeal.
- Aw, yes!

36:28.893 --> 36:31.125
These are hands down my fave!

36:33.569 --> 36:34.506
Mmm.

36:35.076 --> 36:37.421
You should consider
calling these "The Ben".

36:37.445 --> 36:40.957
Yeah, I'll think about it.

36:40.981 --> 36:43.873
So, when is the grand opening?

36:43.897 --> 36:48.342
Uh, maybe a month. I mean there's
still some things left to do.

36:48.366 --> 36:51.519
- Here you go babe. - Oh.
- See now its an opening.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.883
Yeah, my beer-wine!

36:53.907 --> 36:59.163
So, here is to a very sweet
and very successful future.

36:59.541 --> 37:03.011
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

37:03.035 --> 37:04.815
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

37:04.839 --> 37:07.083
Oh no I was just telling

37:07.107 --> 37:09.828
Ben that I really want to do
something with this wall. I just...

37:09.852 --> 37:11.451
don't know what.

37:11.475 --> 37:13.618
I could see a mural here.

37:13.642 --> 37:16.531
Yeah, that would be perfect!

37:16.555 --> 37:19.744
- Well I could work on something.
- Oh, no. That's too much trouble.

37:19.768 --> 37:21.082
No it wouldn't be at all.

37:21.106 --> 37:23.877
You have time for that? With
everything that's going on at Origin?

37:23.901 --> 37:25.982
It, it's really too much to ask.

37:26.006 --> 37:28.226
It would be no problem.

37:28.250 --> 37:30.805
Ben, I'll definitely
let you know.

37:30.829 --> 37:31.948
Okay.

37:31.972 --> 37:37.361
And in the meantime I could definitely
use both of your help eating these.

37:48.048 --> 37:50.728
This place needs a sky.

37:56.024 --> 37:59.657
- Are you feeling okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

38:02.164 --> 38:06.883
Is this about me helping Sarah?
'Cause... I don't have to.

38:08.902 --> 38:12.488
I'm sorry. I should've asked
you before I offered.

38:13.482 --> 38:16.147
I can just tell her that I
don't have time for it.

38:16.171 --> 38:20.622
No, no that's okay. I mean you
guys were a long time ago.

38:21.006 --> 38:23.171
I have nothing to worry about.
Right?

38:23.195 --> 38:28.404
- Of course not.
- Promise?
- Yes.

Ben to go over the plans for the mural.

40:27.596 --> 40:32.252

when you were on the phone with your girlfriend.

Is that what he told you?

have a really busy weekend and I had
to rush to get a bunch of stuff done

45:09.955 --> 45:14.177
before you got here, so can you at
least be grateful that I made time?

45:14.201 --> 45:18.683
Well you could've at least told me this
about a week and I wouldn't have come up.

45:18.707 --> 45:21.634
Well, last time I suggested
pushing back a week,

45:21.658 --> 45:26.609
You are not exactly happy about it
so… Don't say it unless you mean it.

45:26.633 --> 45:30.475
Well I can't help feeling that I'm
less of a priority. I'm trying here.

45:30.499 --> 45:32.630
I'm trying too.

45:49.868 --> 45:54.384
So my friends are going to the city.
There's this free music festival going on.

45:54.408 --> 45:55.835
Do you want to go?

45:55.859 --> 45:58.118
Um, can we take a nap first?

45:58.142 --> 46:01.035
Well they're leaving in about
10 minutes and I'm not tired.

46:01.059 --> 46:05.034
Yeah but I've been up since like 6 AM
trying to get up here. So I'm kinda tired.

46:05.058 --> 46:10.616
I know, but I thought maybe we could just
go, and you can I don't know, relax there.

46:10.640 --> 46:13.426
I come up here for us to have
a little bit of like time together

46:13.450 --> 46:14.952
and you just want to ditch
me with your friends?

46:14.976 --> 46:17.205
I don't want to ditch you. I
want you to come with me.

46:17.229 --> 46:20.505
Huh. Why can't we just have
a little bit of alone time?

46:20.668 --> 46:24.356
Like, we barely get to see each other.
You see them every day.

46:47.859 --> 46:51.558
Oh, um, actually I did want to try
this new place on University Ave.

46:51.582 --> 46:54.610
And they were handing out
coupons on the quad today so…

46:54.634 --> 46:58.855
Maybe if I can find those you
can eat there if you're hungry

46:58.879 --> 47:04.529
And then um, oh that movie
I really wanted to s... see

47:05.859 --> 47:08.918
Haley, everyone's ready to go.

47:08.942 --> 47:11.615
- Um.
- Are you guys coming?
- Yeah, just, just give me a second.

47:11.639 --> 47:13.330
What happened to him?

47:13.354 --> 47:15.685
- He's just tired.
- Come on.

[door closes]

47:28.166 --> 47:30.990
- Man this stuff looks brand-new.
- Well it is.

47:31.014 --> 47:34.119
I never used it. I don't
plan on using it.

47:34.143 --> 47:36.293
I don't know why I bought it.
Painting is hard.

47:36.457 --> 47:40.413
Well thanks. I'll have this
back to you in about a week.

47:40.437 --> 47:44.453
- Used.
- Yeah totally. Cool man.

47:45.876 --> 47:49.364
So this is like a... a pretty
extensive project, huh?

47:49.388 --> 47:53.749
- Sort of. It's just a
lot of moving pieces.
- Yeah.

47:53.773 --> 47:57.492
You guys it's been spending
a lot of time... together.

47:57.516 --> 48:00.049
You know subtlety has
never been your strength.

48:00.073 --> 48:04.319
What are you doing man? I mean,
what you have with Anna is so good.

48:04.343 --> 48:07.358
And she could totally use something
like this against you if you terminate.

48:07.382 --> 48:09.824
Sandy almost wouldn't let
me lend you this stuff.

48:12.556 --> 48:13.947
Hi Sandy!

48:14.936 --> 48:18.396
You're like, camouflaged

48:18.420 --> 48:24.279
No one is terminating, man.
Nothing is happening!

48:24.303 --> 48:28.302
All right. Just as long as you're
being honest with yourself.

48:28.326 --> 48:32.265
Actions don't follow too far
from what's in the heart.

48:32.856 --> 48:36.024
Sandy told me to say that.

48:41.556 --> 48:46.580
- I really love it so far.
- Yeah were almost done.

48:46.604 --> 48:49.759
- I can come again tomorrow night.
- Oh great!

48:49.783 --> 48:52.702
Um, here take my
spare set of keys.

48:52.726 --> 48:54.509
What, you're not
going to be here?

48:54.533 --> 48:57.110
Well, I have to wake up
at three to bake so no.

48:57.134 --> 49:00.874
[mockingly] Well, I have to wake up at three to bake
 - Stupid.

49:00.898 --> 49:03.866
You should take a picture and send
it to Anna. It's really good.

49:03.890 --> 49:05.529
Oh, yes good idea!

49:08.787 --> 49:14.608
God, I wish this was
a bar, not a bakery.

49:14.632 --> 49:16.698
Kill for a beer.

49:17.922 --> 49:20.016
Well you know what?
I don't have beer,

49:20.040 --> 49:23.449
but if you're interested I do
have something a little stronger.

49:23.733 --> 49:28.453
Like a secret stash? [laughing]

49:28.477 --> 49:31.647
You know that I started
drinking scotch because of you?

49:31.671 --> 49:34.395
You mean that in a
good way, right?

49:34.419 --> 49:38.813
Because I really hope I didn't turn
you to drink after we broke up.

49:38.837 --> 49:43.051
- I know it was difficult to lose me.
- Oh my God, shut up!

49:43.075 --> 49:47.244

Oh!

49:47.798 --> 49:54.400
- This is to the DEI.
- Why?

49:54.424 --> 49:57.421
Well if you think about it
they sort of got us here and…

49:57.445 --> 50:00.511
I for one am happy we got a
second chance to sort things out.

50:00.621 --> 50:05.687
- Me too.
[glasses clink]
- Clink!

50:05.711 --> 50:10.056
No seriously, I'm not
talking about every chef...

50:10.080 --> 50:14.855
Has some story about how their
early creations tasted awful but…

50:14.879 --> 50:17.679
You never made one
thing I didn't like.

50:17.703 --> 50:21.377
Bullshit, Ben!
I know what I made.

50:21.401 --> 50:26.577
Well maybe I'm simple,
but, I liked it all.

50:26.601 --> 50:30.618
Yeah well Ben you like the powdered
sugar donuts that come in six packs.

50:30.642 --> 50:34.182
- Oh yes!
- Pastries should not come
in cardboard six packs!

50:34.206 --> 50:37.463
Hey, you should sell those here!

50:37.487 --> 50:40.581
- You need to leave.
- Ahh!
- You need to leave.

50:40.605 --> 50:43.519
- I can't move.
- Ahh!

50:45.433 --> 50:47.539
You did it.

50:49.167 --> 50:52.271
I am so proud of you.

50:52.812 --> 50:56.628
Well, assuming I don't
close in a year.

50:56.652 --> 51:01.225
- Oh shut up!
[laughing]
- It's possible.

51:01.249 --> 51:04.089
This place is gonna be a hit.

51:04.113 --> 51:09.073
If not for the food, then for the
hot owner behind the counter.

51:09.971 --> 51:14.615
You know that's why used to come back
to that restaurant you used to work at.

51:14.639 --> 51:20.043
Well, not all guys are as
dumb and shallow as you.

51:20.067 --> 51:23.324
Oh, but they are! [laughing]

51:28.191 --> 51:30.345
You know what's funny?

51:30.369 --> 51:38.817
When we were together I used to
picture this moment... with you in it.

51:38.841 --> 51:42.836
And then we broke up and…

51:42.860 --> 51:49.934
I stopped envisioning it that
way, I just... removed you.

51:52.249 --> 51:58.807
And now in the end, you're...
actually here.

52:03.117 --> 52:05.156
It's funny.

52:08.387 --> 52:11.145
I never left.

52:31.396 --> 52:33.700
I'm sorry.

52:49.340 --> 53:00.849
[cell phone ringing]

53:00.873 --> 53:03.493
- Hello.
- Hey, what are you up to?

53:03.517 --> 53:05.118
Um, I have practice. What's up?

53:05.142 --> 53:07.954
All right, I have some awesome
news for you. Are you ready?

53:07.978 --> 53:08.866
Yeah, what's up?

53:08.890 --> 53:11.575
<i>So,</i> I just got back
from my academic advisor

53:11.599 --> 53:15.656
And I'm officially transferring
to Goldengate college next year.

53:16.848 --> 53:19.013
Wait. What?

53:19.037 --> 53:20.625
<i>So they bumped me
up on the waitlist</i>

53:20.649 --> 53:23.624
and all I gotta do is keep up my
credits and my GPA and I'm in.

53:23.753 --> 53:27.701
- Isn't that awesome?
- Um, yeah. That's, that's great babe.

53:27.725 --> 53:30.547
Yeah, I'm just gonna be
like 30 minutes away.

53:34.088 --> 53:36.675
Yo! Why are you so quiet?

53:36.699 --> 53:38.940
I was expecting you to be
going like nuts right now.

53:38.964 --> 53:42.444
I'm sorry. I'm, I'm really
excited for you. I'm just...

53:42.468 --> 53:46.487
I'm just surprised. I thought we said
that you're coming up after second year.

53:46.511 --> 53:50.741
Yeah but I was working my ass off
so we don't have <i>to go through…</i>

53:50.765 --> 53:52.495
<i>Another year of long distance.</i>

53:52.519 --> 53:55.238
- Hey.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah no um. Hey
let's just talk about this later.

53:55.262 --> 53:56.751
Okay, um, I'm kind of...

53:56.775 --> 53:59.129
- Alright, yeah.
- Okay, alright, I love you.

53:59.153 --> 54:00.531
- Yeah, I love you.
<i>- Bye.</i>

54:01.881 --> 54:06.999
- So, what are you doing this weekend?
- Nothing. Why?

54:07.023 --> 54:11.741
The guys from the other team are Sigma's
and they invited us to a party.

54:11.765 --> 54:16.056
- Do you want to go?
- I don't know if I should.

54:16.080 --> 54:20.327
Come on! You never
come out with us.

54:20.351 --> 54:23.748
I'd be a bad friend if I never
got you out this whole year.

54:23.772 --> 54:28.632
Please! Come on it'll
be so much fun!

54:28.656 --> 54:32.907
- Okay. Yeah.
- Wait, I didn't expect that.

54:32.931 --> 54:34.700
- Yeah.
- What?

54:34.724 --> 54:40.219
- Stop!
- Everyone she's going to a party!
- It's no big deal! Stop!

54:44.032 --> 54:48.611
- This is bad
- I know.

54:50.900 --> 54:54.020
If I don't draw more
energy cards I am screwed.

54:54.044 --> 54:57.856
What you did is beyond bad.

54:57.880 --> 55:01.448
I know, I'm gonna fix it.
I have to fix it.

55:01.472 --> 55:03.038
What did you expect man?

55:03.062 --> 55:06.583
Oh I'm gonna spend night and
day with my ex-girlfriend,

55:06.607 --> 55:10.550
Working on a fun and exciting new
project that I'm sure won't lead to us

55:10.574 --> 55:13.164
Reigniting our feelings
for each other.

55:13.188 --> 55:15.547
I warned you not to put
yourself in this position.

55:15.571 --> 55:19.428
It's not like a planed for this to
happen when we started the project.

55:19.452 --> 55:22.350
If you knew what was
happening, why'd you go back?

55:22.374 --> 55:26.917
I guess it, it's not like
were getting another chance.

55:26.941 --> 55:29.905
There's maybe a chance
I always wanted it.

55:29.929 --> 55:33.140
What are you guys talking about?

55:33.164 --> 55:36.154
Uh, just girl problems.

55:36.178 --> 55:38.906
It's hopefully something you won't
have to deal with for a long time.

55:38.930 --> 55:42.480
I have a girlfriend. I know
all about girl problems.

55:42.504 --> 55:46.133
Okay no, you do not have a girlfriend, kid.
What are you, like 10?

55:46.157 --> 55:50.910
- I'm eight.
- I'm losing to an eight-year-old.
- Humbling isn't it?

55:50.934 --> 55:56.163
Ben, you do not have a girl problem.
You have a girl... situation.

55:56.187 --> 55:57.932
It hasn't turned
into a problem yet.

55:57.956 --> 56:01.696
I have to terminate with Anna.
I have to.

56:01.720 --> 56:03.934
You've been together
for less than a year.

56:03.958 --> 56:07.233
If you terminate now you can kiss
your score and Origin goodbye.

56:07.257 --> 56:09.100
Everything you've worked
for... out the window.

56:09.124 --> 56:12.018
I can't stay with her. Okay?

56:12.042 --> 56:15.857
What am I gonna lie to her?
That would make me a fr...

56:16.337 --> 56:22.059
- a dishonest person.
- Oh, so now you're worried about honesty.

56:22.083 --> 56:24.957
Look I'm not saying you guys
have to stay together forever.

56:24.981 --> 56:28.078
Just you know, long enough
so if you guys break up,

56:28.102 --> 56:30.647
you're not can have a
huge hit on your score.

56:30.671 --> 56:34.929
You're not helping yourself or
Sarah if you terminate now.

56:34.953 --> 56:37.488
- I win!
- Let's go again.

56:37.512 --> 56:40.777
- But I'm tired.
- You're eight. What you tired from?

56:40.801 --> 56:43.119
Beating you.

56:47.833 --> 56:52.053
- Hey.
- Hey, you're early!

56:52.077 --> 56:55.946
Yeah, I sort of
wanted to talk first.

56:55.970 --> 56:59.122
- Is now a good time?
- Yeah.

56:59.146 --> 57:02.494
I'm just, uh prepping for our
reception tomorrow night.

57:02.518 --> 57:05.506
So what's up?

57:05.530 --> 57:11.753
I wanted to talk
about last night.

57:11.777 --> 57:14.327
Right. Uh.

57:14.351 --> 57:17.943
- Ben, before we get into it.
- Anna, I'm sorry.

57:18.253 --> 57:22.244
I know that it was…

57:22.771 --> 57:25.309
It was what?

57:26.872 --> 57:29.834
Out of line?

57:29.858 --> 57:34.388
And I wanted to apologize.

57:34.412 --> 57:39.738
But look, I want to finish
this mural with you and…

57:41.060 --> 57:45.314
I wasn't sure what you thought.

57:45.338 --> 57:50.498
Maybe we should...
have some space.

57:50.522 --> 57:55.057
Because otherwise things could get complicated
when they really don't need to be.

57:55.081 --> 57:56.566
The things like last night?

57:56.590 --> 57:58.753
Yeah.

57:59.604 --> 58:05.621
- It was my fault. I drank too much and…
- Ben it's fine!

58:05.645 --> 58:10.770
If we let ourselves slip a little
bit it's nothing more than that.

58:10.794 --> 58:13.156
Right?

58:16.615 --> 58:18.438
Right.

58:20.111 --> 58:21.563
Okay.

58:21.587 --> 58:27.217
So I'd... talk to
you later then.

Aw, Jesus.

01:00:14.971 --> 01:00:19.384
I shouldn't say anything. Um.
She went out with Tiff.

01:00:19.408 --> 01:00:21.124
Please don't ask me
where they went.

01:00:21.148 --> 01:00:23.444

- Thank you.

01:00:39.290 --> 01:00:43.230
So, do you know any of
the guys in this frat?

01:00:43.254 --> 01:00:46.151
Um, kind of, I mean
they invited us here.

01:00:46.175 --> 01:00:48.272
- Why?
- Yeah…

01:00:48.296 --> 01:00:51.311
You probably shouldn't be
hanging out with those guys.

01:00:51.335 --> 01:00:55.737

- Seth?

This asshole's just
trying to sleep with you!

No he's not!

01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:26.154
They just bring registered girls
here so they can hook up with them.

01:01:26.178 --> 01:01:27.505
I was just explaining
that to her.

01:01:27.529 --> 01:01:30.701
Jay's my TA. Okay? He was
just trying to help.

01:01:33.583 --> 01:01:34.781
Good?

01:01:34.805 --> 01:01:35.929
Yeah.

a party like this anyways?

Uh, I'll look it up.

01:02:04.483 --> 01:02:07.740
So I heard the other
designers talking about you.

01:02:07.764 --> 01:02:10.071
- Really?
- Yeah, they really like you.

I can totally see you getting
promoted as lead designer soon.

01:02:12.989 --> 01:02:15.969
Which would be awesome
because then I can quit!

01:02:15.993 --> 01:02:18.149
What do you mean?

01:02:18.173 --> 01:02:21.606
Well, after we get married I'd want to
stay home and take care of the kids.

I should be done this week.

to you about this all week

Were you physical?

We had a drink to celebrate
the other night and…

We got a little tipsy
and we kissed.

that ever happened.

01:03:34.873 --> 01:03:37.976
Oh well thank God because then
you'd really be messed up.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.495
- Anna, I'm sorry.
- No! You lied to me!

01:03:40.519 --> 01:03:43.871
From the very beginning you told
me I had nothing to worry about!

01:03:43.895 --> 01:03:47.709
You made me look like an idiot! I knew
I shouldn't have trusted that bitch.

01:03:47.733 --> 01:03:51.875
- Sarah would never…
- Do not defend her right now!

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:56.699

file for termination.

Just got breakfast
with some friends.

- It's not like you would've come.

Why are you going
through my stuff?

It was right on top of your desk.
That's not going through anything.

Am I not allowed to know that my
girlfriend is going to London?

- Why didn't you tell me?

- But you never even mentioned it.

It's just something I'm looking into. I
haven't even decided if I'm gonna go.

Why do you have everything planned out?
Like where you wanna live? Classes?

It's a really amazing
opportunity.

to save up to move up here? No!

trying really hard too.

01:05:39.925 --> 01:05:43.973
Okay, you're the one making all these plans and
decisions and you never asked me about them.

You just come…

clear my entire schedule

anything with my friends.

01:08:05.931 --> 01:08:08.040
Yeah, sure. What's on your mind?

01:08:08.064 --> 01:08:12.323
Did you ever feel like nothing's
going according to plan?

01:08:12.347 --> 01:08:16.845
Well, today kind of felt like that.
And yesterday too.

01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:20.984
and the day before that. So yeah,
I think I know the feeling.

01:08:21.008 --> 01:08:25.595
I just, I really believed things
would be going a certain way.

01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:30.365
But now everything's
just falling apart.

01:08:30.389 --> 01:08:33.142
Are we talking about
your boyfriend?

01:08:33.166 --> 01:08:37.127
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Sorry about that.

01:08:37.151 --> 01:08:42.685
We registered before we came here.
We were so sure.

01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:46.736
- But now…
- But now you're not so sure.

01:08:48.162 --> 01:08:53.140
Look, Haley. Having a plan doesn't
always mean having control.

01:08:53.163 --> 01:08:55.903
- That's just life.
- Yeah.

01:08:55.926 --> 01:08:59.715
Now, learning how to move forward
when you don't have that control...

01:08:59.738 --> 01:09:02.203
That's growing up.

01:09:02.227 --> 01:09:05.854

- Yeah.

01:09:05.879 --> 01:09:07.537
Yeah it does. Doesn't it?

01:09:08.115 --> 01:09:11.767
You'll be okay. More than okay.

01:09:11.791 --> 01:09:13.697
See you Thursday?

01:09:24.813 --> 01:09:27.938
You know I wish I could say
you weren't a good fit here.

01:09:28.764 --> 01:09:33.962
But, the truth is we just, we
have to follow our guidelines.

01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:36.057
Terminating your relationship

01:09:36.081 --> 01:09:39.881
will unfortunately bring your score back
down below our minimum requirement here.

01:09:39.906 --> 01:09:41.741
I understand.

01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:44.658
I'm really sorry Ben.

01:09:44.683 --> 01:09:47.932
Letting people go is never easy.

01:09:48.729 --> 01:09:50.256
But it's my job,

01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:52.246
and if I have to do it,

01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:56.778
I usually tell myself that they
were always meant something else.

01:10:03.557 --> 01:10:05.447
Ben.

01:10:15.852 --> 01:10:19.402

want this to happen.

Anna, this is...

01:10:23.982 --> 01:10:26.507
Far from your fault.

I'm sorry, I lost sight of us.

01:10:32.351 --> 01:10:35.041
I kept things from you.

01:10:36.162 --> 01:10:41.759

was weak and afraid.

I'm sorry.

01:10:48.721 --> 01:10:52.720

<i>Can you talk?</i>

01:11:31.686 --> 01:11:36.944
I'm actually just getting
dropped off at the airport.

01:11:36.968 --> 01:11:40.391
What are you doing at the airport?

01:11:40.415 --> 01:11:43.098
I'm flying up to see you, babe.

01:11:43.122 --> 01:11:44.453
What?

01:11:44.477 --> 01:11:48.103
I thought it would just be faster to
fly up and work this out in person.

01:11:48.127 --> 01:11:53.952
Seth? Look, you're doing it again.
Okay? You're, you're making…

01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:57.002
decisions for us and just assuming
that I'll be fine with it.

01:11:57.026 --> 01:11:59.097
Yeah, but you weren't
answering your phone.

01:11:59.121 --> 01:12:01.214
And what's wrong with
me wanting to see you.

01:12:01.238 --> 01:12:03.960
You don't get it. I mean,
it's, it's not about…

01:12:03.984 --> 01:12:06.220
Seeing each other. Okay? It's about…

01:12:06.244 --> 01:12:09.285
growing with each other. And right
now we're not growing because

01:12:09.309 --> 01:12:12.602
<i>you're the only one making any decisions
for how this relationship is working</i>

01:12:12.626 --> 01:12:16.538
- And every time I try to tell you that…
- So I'm just holding you back?

01:12:16.562 --> 01:12:19.356
You just get upset.

01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:22.664
Babe, we'll just talk about
this in person. Okay?

01:12:22.688 --> 01:12:27.672
Seth, don't get on the plane.
Okay? Just…

01:12:27.696 --> 01:12:30.557
Please, please don't come up.

01:12:30.581 --> 01:12:33.263
Why not?

01:12:35.599 --> 01:12:39.319
I think we should stop
seeing each other.

01:12:40.358 --> 01:12:42.600
What are you trying to say? Like...

01:12:43.424 --> 01:12:45.941
Like no more visiting, or...

01:12:45.965 --> 01:12:48.779
just wait till you come
back for summer, right?

01:12:48.803 --> 01:12:50.614
No.

01:12:51.050 --> 01:12:54.777
Like... I think we should terminate.

01:12:56.218 --> 01:12:59.671
What? No! <i>Haley stop! What?</i>

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:02.260
<i>Please, not like this,
not over the phone.</i>

01:13:02.284 --> 01:13:05.939
- Just give me two hours. I'll be right
 over to work this out. Okay?
- Seth, Seth stop.

01:13:05.963 --> 01:13:09.801
I, I can't do this anymore.
Okay?

01:13:09.825 --> 01:13:13.769
I mean, we're not the same people.
We're not living the same lives.

01:13:13.793 --> 01:13:16.322
I mean, don't you see?

01:13:17.822 --> 01:13:19.783
But I love you.

01:13:24.425 --> 01:13:28.026
Our love isn't the same either.

01:13:33.193 --> 01:13:35.513
I'm sorry.

01:14:08.703 --> 01:14:11.033
- Ben!
- Sarah are you okay?

01:14:11.057 --> 01:14:12.216
What are you doing here?

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.087
Well I've been calling
but you didn't pick up.

01:14:14.251 --> 01:14:16.285
Because I didn't
want to talk to you.

01:14:17.671 --> 01:14:19.148
Totally fair.

01:14:19.439 --> 01:14:21.975
Look, I, I know that you are...

01:14:21.999 --> 01:14:23.900
pissed at me and I am sorry.

01:14:23.924 --> 01:14:26.306
- This is not about you, Ben.
- Just let me finish. Okay?

01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:29.492
This is important.
I am an idiot.

01:14:29.516 --> 01:14:31.372
Okay?

01:14:32.676 --> 01:14:36.836
Anna found out what happened between
us and was about to terminate with me.

01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:41.445
I would've lost my job,
her, my score everything.

01:14:41.469 --> 01:14:43.845
She wanted to give
me another chance.

01:14:45.172 --> 01:14:46.973
But I told her no.

01:14:49.041 --> 01:14:50.886
Because it wouldn't be right.

01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:53.793
It wouldn't be fair. Because I…

01:14:54.646 --> 01:14:56.058
want to be with you.

01:15:06.625 --> 01:15:07.859
Sarah.

01:15:11.455 --> 01:15:14.570
It was only supposed
to be one year.

01:15:14.594 --> 01:15:16.811
No strings attached.

01:15:17.433 --> 01:15:19.632
I'm sorry. What?

01:15:22.035 --> 01:15:24.878
When you and I broke up.

01:15:25.449 --> 01:15:28.604
The thought of opening this place was
the only thing that kept me going.

01:15:30.156 --> 01:15:35.498
I needed a loan. But my score was too low
so I had to find a way to raise it. Quick.

01:15:37.048 --> 01:15:38.673
Jeremy was...

01:15:39.618 --> 01:15:41.797
just a friend but he...

01:15:42.079 --> 01:15:43.299
had this idea...

01:15:44.208 --> 01:15:46.347
something he had done before...

01:15:46.371 --> 01:15:48.432
Sarah, what are you saying?

01:15:49.965 --> 01:15:51.923
I faked my score.

01:15:54.536 --> 01:15:59.186
I know it's fraud but it's not
like anyone was gonna get hurt.

01:16:00.903 --> 01:16:02.817
What happens now?

01:16:09.594 --> 01:16:11.149
It's all over.

01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:20.300
With the penalties I'm a sub 20 now
so the bank is retracting my loan.

01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:24.141
They're taking it all back.

01:16:24.547 --> 01:16:27.351
Not to mention the fines. So...

01:16:30.164 --> 01:16:31.602
I have nothing.

01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:39.913
- We'll figure this out together.
- No, I'll figure this out.

01:16:39.937 --> 01:16:43.399
I was fine before you came
back into the picture.

01:16:43.423 --> 01:16:47.847
It's because I helped you with your score they
looked into my record again in the first place.

01:16:47.871 --> 01:16:50.293
This relationship keeps
coming back to haunt me.

01:16:50.317 --> 01:16:52.382
I'm done, Ben.

01:16:52.406 --> 01:16:53.726
What about what I just said?

01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:56.259
What that now you want me
because you have nothing left?

01:16:56.283 --> 01:16:59.794
No, that is not what I meant.
I, look if anything... I...

01:16:59.818 --> 01:17:02.790
I loved you so much, Ben.

01:17:05.078 --> 01:17:09.315
It was hard enough when we terminated.
And these last few months…

01:17:11.174 --> 01:17:13.049
I let you back in.

01:17:14.114 --> 01:17:16.686
And you tell me it was all a mistake?

01:17:19.115 --> 01:17:21.872
You make me feel so stupid.

01:17:23.875 --> 01:17:28.926
And now you're back and you want to fight
for me? Oh, I'm sorry it's too late.

01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:30.922
Look, I know that I hurt you but...

01:17:30.946 --> 01:17:36.809
What if this happened for a reason? You
know, now we can have another chance.

01:17:38.194 --> 01:17:39.600
Oh.

01:17:40.317 --> 01:17:42.053
Look at us Ben.

01:17:42.839 --> 01:17:45.942
Our lives are shit.
Our scores are shit.

01:17:45.966 --> 01:17:50.386
I mean do you honestly think that getting
back together right now is a great idea?

01:17:50.410 --> 01:17:52.560
- Yes.
- How do you know that?

01:17:52.584 --> 01:17:53.765
Because I love you.

01:18:00.318 --> 01:18:03.091
I don't love you anymore Ben.

01:18:24.564 --> 01:18:26.519
No one ever told me
this was an issue.

01:18:26.543 --> 01:18:30.032
I'm sorry, but as I said,
it's a policy of the program.

01:18:30.056 --> 01:18:33.297
What does my EI score have
to do with my education?

01:18:33.321 --> 01:18:37.678
I mean my GPA dropping or not having
enough credits fine but this is absurd.

01:18:37.702 --> 01:18:39.875
As I said, I am sorry

01:18:39.899 --> 01:18:42.165
but the list of eligible
students is quite long so

01:18:42.189 --> 01:18:44.748
all things must be
taken into account.

01:18:45.942 --> 01:18:48.383
Although only slightly lower,

01:18:48.407 --> 01:18:53.383
no other student had
anything on their records.

01:18:56.665 --> 01:19:02.260
Remember what I said about having a plan
doesn't always mean having control?

01:19:09.377 --> 01:19:13.848
Who know, you know maybe...
this is the start of something new.

01:19:13.872 --> 01:19:15.952
something...

01:19:17.823 --> 01:19:18.854
better.

01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:25.723
Well...

01:19:27.290 --> 01:19:28.778
I, I thought...

01:19:32.435 --> 01:19:33.732
Haley.

01:19:40.607 --> 01:19:48.764

01:19:51.237 --> 01:19:52.422
Hey.

01:19:52.446 --> 01:19:54.994
Hey. Haley.

01:19:55.018 --> 01:19:58.503
I did not… I didn't
think you'd pick up

01:20:00.284 --> 01:20:03.330
Guess I thought it'd be
nice to hear your voice.

01:20:04.339 --> 01:20:08.088
Yeah. Just weird not
talking to you anymore.

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:11.899
It'll be normal someday.

01:20:13.517 --> 01:20:14.790
What if I don't want it to?

01:20:15.798 --> 01:20:16.970
Seth.

01:20:17.777 --> 01:20:18.925
We can't.

01:20:20.268 --> 01:20:22.044
I know, I know, I know.

01:20:22.068 --> 01:20:25.430
It's just I was feeling kind of down and...

01:20:25.658 --> 01:20:28.160
Every time I'd felt that way I
would just call you. It's just…

01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:30.615
Yeah, but.

01:20:31.323 --> 01:20:34.081
We're not together anymore.

01:20:35.201 --> 01:20:36.859
Wow. Yeah. Thank you...

01:20:36.883 --> 01:20:38.478
for that reminder
Haley because I

01:20:38.502 --> 01:20:40.925
totally forgot that you broke
up with me over the phone.

01:20:46.344 --> 01:20:48.173
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:20:49.529 --> 01:20:51.068
No, it's okay.

01:20:52.383 --> 01:20:55.000
I'm sorry too.

01:20:56.315 --> 01:21:00.080
Hey, are you still
gonna move up here?

01:21:00.104 --> 01:21:02.800
You were so the
only reason so...

01:21:03.514 --> 01:21:05.670
Especially now that you're
moving to London <i>I really…</i>

01:21:06.311 --> 01:21:08.022
I really don't see the point.

01:21:09.122 --> 01:21:11.149
I'm not going anymore.

01:21:11.173 --> 01:21:12.755
Wait what?

01:21:12.779 --> 01:21:16.324
Our termination
dropped my score…

01:21:16.348 --> 01:21:20.276
And apparently they consider
that for the program.

01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:22.190
Isn't there anything
you could do?

01:21:25.387 --> 01:21:26.749
I don't know.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.263
This is it.

01:21:53.287 --> 01:21:56.905
I can't believe we're doing this.
You're sure, right?

01:21:56.929 --> 01:21:58.212
Of course. I love you.

01:21:58.236 --> 01:22:01.315

01:22:08.451 --> 01:22:11.160
Hey. Ben. Right?

01:22:11.184 --> 01:22:14.176
Yeah. What are you doing here?

01:22:16.666 --> 01:22:19.251
Oh, I'm sorry, man.

01:22:19.275 --> 01:22:21.063
First one?

01:22:23.586 --> 01:22:26.313
First one's always the hardest.

01:22:26.878 --> 01:22:29.458
I just feel so stupid.

01:22:34.385 --> 01:22:38.220
I really thought that me and
Haley could be… Forever.

01:22:39.524 --> 01:22:42.332
I believed that we
could be an exception.

01:22:42.885 --> 01:22:44.170
To what?

01:22:44.194 --> 01:22:47.572
To everything that people told
us when we first registered.

01:22:48.888 --> 01:22:51.848
I thought we'd outlast all the
doubts, all the distance...

01:22:51.872 --> 01:22:56.594
All the warnings about young
love. But… We couldn't.

01:22:58.451 --> 01:23:03.700
We weren't the exception. We
were just another example.

01:23:04.630 --> 01:23:07.380
There's nothing wrong
with being wrong man.

01:23:08.333 --> 01:23:10.451
You're supposed
to make mistakes.

01:23:11.466 --> 01:23:14.796
You're supposed to get hurt.
That's what love is.

01:23:16.049 --> 01:23:17.987
Especially young love.

01:23:18.011 --> 01:23:20.785
Well… That does not matter now.

01:23:21.747 --> 01:23:23.352
None of it does.

01:23:24.672 --> 01:23:26.575
- The scores only going to prove that.
- No.

01:23:26.599 --> 01:23:30.050
The score only shows you
what happened. Not…

01:23:38.401 --> 01:23:39.956
Did you really love her?

01:23:41.553 --> 01:23:43.358
Yeah.

01:23:47.474 --> 01:23:48.646
Then…

01:23:50.201 --> 01:23:55.353
End things in a way that's
worthy of that love.

01:23:58.576 --> 01:24:01.353

After reviewing your report and
evaluations of relationship metrics…

01:24:25.711 --> 01:24:31.809
I will be assigning 82% of responsibility

My relationship with Sarah was way
before Jeremy was ever in the picture.

01:25:56.619 --> 01:25:59.051
It's a standard DEI protocol.

01:25:59.075 --> 01:26:01.925
In EI score fraud cases we

01:26:01.949 --> 01:26:03.958
Uh, do background investigations

01:26:03.982 --> 01:26:07.206
on the accused past relationships
to rule out further collusion.

01:26:07.230 --> 01:26:11.415
In other words we want to make sure your
relationship with Sarah was legitimate.

01:26:12.071 --> 01:26:15.816
Shouldn't you have this
information in your system?

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:22.576
Well we have statistics and data
but there are certain… Limits.

01:26:23.018 --> 01:26:24.709
That's one way to put it.

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:29.146
You are aware that this
interview is being recorded?

01:26:29.944 --> 01:26:33.553
How long will this take?
Because I have to head to…

01:26:33.577 --> 01:26:37.124
Oh wait, absolutely nothing!

01:26:37.148 --> 01:26:40.544
Thanks to the DEI I don't
have a job anymore.

01:26:40.568 --> 01:26:42.625
Well then we'll make this quick.

01:26:42.649 --> 01:26:48.986
So, when you first met Sarah, was
it arranged by any third parties?

01:26:49.010 --> 01:26:53.205
Yep, I was on a blind
date with a third party…

01:26:53.353 --> 01:26:56.677
She crashed it; then I
couldn't stop thinking about her.

01:26:56.701 --> 01:26:59.515
- Was there any money exchanged?
- Yeah.

01:26:59.539 --> 01:27:05.466
Was this money exchanged in agreement for
any fraudulent relationship activity?

01:27:05.490 --> 01:27:08.330
I was paying for my date's dinner.

01:27:08.354 --> 01:27:12.406
Okay Mr. Soo, I would appreciate it
if you took this audit seriously.

01:27:12.430 --> 01:27:15.379
If we can't determine whether your
relationship with Sarah was real,

01:27:15.403 --> 01:27:16.750
you could also be penalized.

01:27:16.774 --> 01:27:20.705
What happens when
my score hits zero?

01:27:20.729 --> 01:27:21.791
[Exhales]

01:27:23.517 --> 01:27:27.300
Can you please describe your
relationship with Sarah?

01:27:38.719 --> 01:27:40.156
[door opening]

01:27:42.461 --> 01:27:43.419
[door closing]

01:27:43.443 --> 01:27:48.749
So I've confirmed your relationship
with Ben was legitimate…

01:27:48.773 --> 01:27:52.977
But, uh, unfortunately all
current penalties will remain.

01:27:54.409 --> 01:27:56.104
I understand.

01:28:00.513 --> 01:28:02.740
What did he say?

01:28:03.636 --> 01:28:05.394
He said the right things.

01:28:15.312 --> 01:28:17.189
Is he okay?

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:21.762
Yeah he's fine.

01:28:23.327 --> 01:28:24.850
[door opening]

01:28:26.682 --> 01:28:28.198
[door closing]

01:28:39.297 --> 01:28:41.390
Sarah!

01:28:42.443 --> 01:28:43.818
Um.

01:28:43.842 --> 01:28:51.647
I'm not legally allowed to do this but
uh, this is a recording of the audit.

01:28:51.671 --> 01:28:54.054
I uh think you should have it.

01:28:59.772 --> 01:29:01.220
Thanks.

01:29:01.812 --> 01:29:03.085
Yeah.

01:29:40.050 --> 01:29:44.242
<i>Can you please describe your
relationship with Sarah?</i>

01:29:46.918 --> 01:29:47.980
We were...

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:51.592
Flawed and…

01:29:51.616 --> 01:29:53.655
So flawed.

01:29:55.285 --> 01:30:00.450
At the same time we were
oddly perfect. Just…

01:30:01.155 --> 01:30:06.412
Couldn't separate the two so
that destroyed us in the end.

01:30:07.181 --> 01:30:10.641
I wasn't there for her
when she needed me most.

01:30:11.187 --> 01:30:14.861
But if you think about it, that forced
her into this entire situation.

01:30:14.885 --> 01:30:18.825
<i>It was no reason for
anyone to commit EI fraud.</i>

01:30:18.849 --> 01:30:20.306
<i>Yes.</i>

01:30:20.330 --> 01:30:22.363
<i>Sarah made a mistake.</i>

01:30:22.387 --> 01:30:25.549
<b>She made a bad call. Who hasn't?</b>

01:30:25.573 --> 01:30:30.457
She wouldn't've had to resort to
it if it weren't for me. If, if...

01:30:30.481 --> 01:30:33.597
If I hadn't let her go...

01:30:34.323 --> 01:30:36.472
If I had...

01:30:36.496 --> 01:30:39.423
fought for us.

01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:44.776
<i>Well, perhaps you should just look past
this and focus on the future of your score.</i>

01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:46.496
<i>[forceful exhale] My score...</i>

01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:52.609
I'm sorry, my score does not reflect
how much I can love someone...

01:30:53.617 --> 01:30:55.922
even after they're out of my life.

01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:02.202
You and the DEI can give people
whatever number you want, but...

01:31:02.226 --> 01:31:06.244
we make the mistakes.

01:31:06.863 --> 01:31:10.649
We should be allowed to take risks

01:31:10.673 --> 01:31:16.350
and fail and love without
a score to consider.

01:31:18.152 --> 01:31:21.379
<i>The system simply exists
to minimize risks</i>

01:31:21.403 --> 01:31:24.526
<i>and potential emotional
damage between couples.</i>

01:31:27.214 --> 01:31:29.839
That's too bad.

01:31:30.801 --> 01:31:33.258
You guys...

01:31:33.282 --> 01:31:37.888
try to make love easier, but
you're missing the whole point.

01:31:37.912 --> 01:31:40.228
It's not supposed to be...

01:31:41.376 --> 01:31:42.806
easy.

01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:47.052
It's supposed to test you,

01:31:47.076 --> 01:31:49.056
break you down,

01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:52.735
and hurt like hell.

01:31:55.328 --> 01:31:57.907
The we who choose to
go through that way.

01:32:01.368 --> 01:32:04.063
That's what's really important.

01:33:57.294 --> 01:33:58.973
Ben?

01:33:59.423 --> 01:34:01.485
Sarah!

01:34:03.524 --> 01:34:05.446
What are you doing here?

01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:09.689
I just uh...

01:34:09.713 --> 01:34:11.756
wanted to finish this.

01:34:15.052 --> 01:34:19.169
You know they sold the place. Right?

01:34:19.193 --> 01:34:20.364
Yeah.

01:34:22.796 --> 01:34:24.171
So that's it, huh?

01:34:26.450 --> 01:34:29.332
Um, I guess I should give
these back to you then.

01:34:29.356 --> 01:34:30.684
[keys jingle]

01:34:31.145 --> 01:34:34.385
Alright. Um...

01:34:36.283 --> 01:34:37.650
Thanks.

01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:40.533
So. How have you been?

01:34:41.274 --> 01:34:43.969
Getting by. I guess.

01:34:44.178 --> 01:34:45.577
You?

01:34:46.256 --> 01:34:49.475
Oh, you know, just giving
myself some time off.

01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:53.261
We don't stand a chance
out there do we?

01:34:53.285 --> 01:34:55.668
Two sub 30s.

01:35:01.702 --> 01:35:03.341
What do you think her score is?

01:35:07.639 --> 01:35:09.587
I don't think she cares.

01:35:15.290 --> 01:35:17.433
It's a shame we didn't
get to finish it.

01:35:18.774 --> 01:35:21.992
We could... finish it now.

01:35:25.676 --> 01:35:27.035
What if...

01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:30.408
we start over?

01:37:18.096 --> 01:37:20.740
These are all for me. Right?

01:37:20.764 --> 01:37:23.524
Don't tell my co-workers.
[laughs]

01:37:23.548 --> 01:37:26.761
Oh, by the way, everything,
everything looks great here.

01:37:26.785 --> 01:37:29.359
You know, I mean, you guys have
nearly perfect credit and EI

01:37:29.383 --> 01:37:33.245
scores are just gonna make the
loan process go by so smoothly.

01:37:33.269 --> 01:37:36.538
Do you have any experience
running a café?

01:37:39.376 --> 01:37:41.383
We don't.

01:37:42.324 --> 01:37:47.077
But we have someone in mind
who'd be perfect for the job.

01:37:48.068 --> 01:37:49.318
Yes, we do.
