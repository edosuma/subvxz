WEBVTT

00:04.526 --> 00:06.963
You can't be serious.
Does it look like I'm laughing?

00:07.007 --> 00:09.028
You need to calm down.
I'll calm down when you explain

00:09.052 --> 00:11.074
how you could post this,
'cause the only takeaway I get

00:11.098 --> 00:12.708
is you're a straight-up racist.

00:12.751 --> 00:14.188
Hey. What the hell's going on?

00:14.231 --> 00:16.103
Officer Serrano somehow has it
in her head...

00:16.146 --> 00:17.191
In my head?

00:17.234 --> 00:19.845
You posted it. It's out there.

00:19.889 --> 00:22.152
"If every minority

00:22.196 --> 00:24.067
"in NYC suddenly disappeared,

00:24.111 --> 00:25.471
the crime rate
would drop to zero."

00:25.503 --> 00:26.809
He didn't write this.

00:26.852 --> 00:29.551
Username is JamieReaganNYPD,
isn't it?

00:29.594 --> 00:31.118
It's fake. I don't post

00:31.161 --> 00:33.772
on SquawkTalk
or any other social media.

00:33.816 --> 00:34.967
Yeah, Marisol,
he's telling the truth.

00:34.991 --> 00:36.775
And you're kissing his ass.

00:36.819 --> 00:38.386
Nice to know whose team
you're on.

00:38.429 --> 00:41.084
A post that says the Giants
are the best team in the NFL.

00:41.128 --> 00:43.956
Come on,
the sarge is not a racist.

00:49.136 --> 00:50.659
Okay.

00:50.702 --> 00:55.011
So someone else
must've posted this garbage.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.404
Sorry, Sarge.

00:56.447 --> 00:58.406
Thank you.

00:58.449 --> 00:59.972
Back to work.

01:07.197 --> 01:08.459
What the hell, right?

01:08.503 --> 01:11.767
I mean, people
have pranked you before but...

01:11.810 --> 01:13.551
But who hates me this much?

01:15.292 --> 01:17.294
No comment.

01:17.338 --> 01:19.775
I'll say it again. "No comment"

01:19.818 --> 01:21.385
is taken as a comment,

01:21.429 --> 01:25.085
insofar as it is assumed
you're ducking the issue.

01:25.128 --> 01:26.869
Then what phrase can I use

01:26.912 --> 01:30.264
to communicate I have no opinion
on the matter?

01:30.307 --> 01:31.439
One doesn't exist anymore.

01:31.482 --> 01:35.095
There isn't a single combination
of words

01:35.138 --> 01:37.314
in the English language... Sir.

01:41.144 --> 01:43.451
I don't like that look.

01:43.494 --> 01:46.454
20 minutes ago an off-duty
detective from the 7-4 squad,

01:46.497 --> 01:49.674
shot a man in a Bronx mini-mart.

01:49.718 --> 01:51.198
The victim?

01:51.241 --> 01:53.417
Dead at the scene. No I.D.

01:53.461 --> 01:55.178
Please say he was stopping
a robbery or something.

01:55.202 --> 01:58.030
Owner says the detective
began harassing the other man,

01:58.074 --> 01:59.249
and then opened fire.

01:59.293 --> 02:00.337
He have a name?

02:00.381 --> 02:03.035
Doug Lynch.

02:03.079 --> 02:06.213
You know, boss, I should go
up there and sort things out.

02:06.256 --> 02:08.997
That's not necessary.

02:09.041 --> 02:11.435
No. It's just that I've know
Doug Lynch for almost 20 years.

02:11.479 --> 02:13.350
I'd like One PP
to make an appearance.

02:13.394 --> 02:15.222
With your blessing, of course.

02:20.314 --> 02:22.185
What did I just see?

02:22.229 --> 02:25.188
Your guess is as good as mine.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:37.244 --> 02:39.071
Night, Ms. Reagan.

02:39.115 --> 02:40.334
Thanks, Annie.

02:40.377 --> 02:41.987
Am I crazy?

02:42.031 --> 02:43.878
Has that guy been out on that
bench for the last six hours?

02:43.902 --> 02:45.600
Says he needs to
talk to Anthony.

02:45.643 --> 02:47.384
Who's been in court all day.

02:47.428 --> 02:51.258
I told him to try again
tomorrow but he won't budge.

02:55.087 --> 02:57.351
Hi, I'm Erin Reagan.

02:57.394 --> 02:58.482
Can I help you?

02:58.526 --> 03:01.311
Sorry, only Anthony Abetemarco
can.

03:01.355 --> 03:03.618
Well, I'm his boss so try me.

03:06.273 --> 03:08.318
My name's Leo Stutz.

03:08.362 --> 03:10.146
I work for Freddy Fallaci.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.495
I'm guessing
you've heard of him.

03:11.539 --> 03:13.367
Yeah. Only by reputation.

03:13.410 --> 03:15.195
Drug dealer and murderous thug.

03:15.238 --> 03:18.198
And you've been working your ass
trying to nail him but can't.

03:18.241 --> 03:19.982
So I'm here to help.

03:20.025 --> 03:22.724
And I'm here to wonder
what's in it for you.

03:22.767 --> 03:25.292
Look, I'm a nobody.

03:25.335 --> 03:28.077
I run errands for Freddy,
sometimes drive him around.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.427
But I've seen
the bad stuff he does

03:30.471 --> 03:32.473
and I can't take it any longer.

03:32.516 --> 03:34.301
Personally, the guy deserves
to go down.

03:34.344 --> 03:35.867
And I can make it happen.

03:35.911 --> 03:37.105
So why not
just go to the police?

03:37.129 --> 03:38.783
Why Detective Abetemarco?

03:38.827 --> 03:41.395
'Cause I'm his little brother

03:41.438 --> 03:43.788
and family looks out for family.

04:04.548 --> 04:06.028
How's Doug?

04:06.071 --> 04:07.682
Cut his arm diving for cover.

04:07.725 --> 04:09.336
Fared better than
the other guy, though.

04:09.379 --> 04:10.293
I got eyes.

04:10.337 --> 04:11.860
But F.I.D.'s on the way.

04:11.903 --> 04:13.296
They can interview him
at the 7-4.

04:13.340 --> 04:14.428
It's calmer there. Got it.

04:14.471 --> 04:15.777
What about the PC?

04:15.820 --> 04:17.213
He's been apprised.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.128
If he has any questions,
I'll answer them.

04:19.171 --> 04:20.303
You sure that'll still work?

04:20.346 --> 04:22.000
I got this, Gus. RAMPTON Okay.

04:22.043 --> 04:24.394
Guys, argue about this later.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.360
Officer, what's going on?

04:33.403 --> 04:34.578
Detective.

04:34.622 --> 04:37.015
And I thought I got here quick.

04:37.059 --> 04:39.037
We were helping execute
a warrant a couple blocks over.

04:39.061 --> 04:40.410
You go in?

04:40.454 --> 04:41.933
Just to make sure
the lady's dead.

04:41.977 --> 04:43.370
Mei-Ling Chan.

04:43.413 --> 04:44.825
Neighbors say her daughter,
Margo, lives with her,

04:44.849 --> 04:46.373
but I couldn't find her.

04:46.416 --> 04:49.245
Do us a favor, clear out
the nosy neighbors, okay?

04:49.289 --> 04:50.507
You got it.

04:54.250 --> 04:55.817
Looks like she was strangled.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.471
Body's fresh.

04:57.514 --> 05:01.301
Enough food for two, also fresh.

05:02.606 --> 05:05.609
I'm gonna take a look around.

05:08.351 --> 05:10.440
Margo?

05:17.317 --> 05:18.405
Stay away from me!

05:18.448 --> 05:19.841
Whoa! Whoa. It's okay.

05:19.884 --> 05:21.799
Police. Margo?

05:21.843 --> 05:23.627
It's okay.

05:23.671 --> 05:24.933
Baez.

05:24.976 --> 05:26.021
Come on.

05:26.064 --> 05:27.675
You're safe. Come on.

05:27.718 --> 05:29.416
Get a bus.

05:29.459 --> 05:31.505
5-4 detectives to Central.
We need a bus forthwith.

05:31.548 --> 05:33.333
266 Madison Avenue.
We have a female,

05:33.376 --> 05:35.160
mid-20s... But, but what about my mom?

05:35.204 --> 05:36.703
Whoa, whoa. Wait. Hey. W-Wait. Mom? Mom!

05:36.727 --> 05:39.469
No!

05:39.513 --> 05:42.342
It's okay.

05:44.866 --> 05:47.477
Okay. Okay.

05:47.521 --> 05:49.436
Mom.

06:13.024 --> 06:16.419
But I'm an only child.
And that's what I said.

06:16.463 --> 06:17.725
Leo Stutz.

06:17.768 --> 06:20.031
Anthony Abetemarco.

06:20.075 --> 06:22.991
First off, explain this crap
about being my brother.

06:23.034 --> 06:24.558
Half brother, actually.

06:24.601 --> 06:26.001
Which means
you're only half insane.

06:26.037 --> 06:27.430
Come on, really?

06:27.474 --> 06:29.258
You don't remember me
from the old days?

06:29.301 --> 06:31.782
I was the little kid you
used to call "Leo the Leech"

06:31.826 --> 06:34.394
'cause I hung around you even
after you told me to get lost.

06:34.437 --> 06:36.483
I remember Leo the Leech.

06:36.526 --> 06:37.875
He was a lot shorter.

06:37.919 --> 06:39.442
And you was a lot skinnier.

06:39.486 --> 06:42.445
So what street did I, live on?

06:42.489 --> 06:44.273
Willow Vista. Number 17.

06:44.316 --> 06:45.796
And I was two blocks away, on...

06:45.840 --> 06:47.145
Hickory Ridge. Yeah.

06:47.189 --> 06:48.930
All right. So you do know him?

06:48.973 --> 06:51.019
Doesn't prove we're related. Come on, look.

06:51.062 --> 06:53.456
My mom had a problem playing
the ponies down at Freehold.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.675
Got in real deep to your dad.

06:54.718 --> 06:57.504
One day, he came by,
told her to pay up...

06:57.547 --> 06:59.419
She paid up, all right.

06:59.462 --> 07:01.551
That does sound like my old man.

07:01.595 --> 07:04.380
Nine months later, ta-da!

07:04.424 --> 07:05.599
I gotta say, you do have

07:05.642 --> 07:08.863
a certain Abetemarco style
about you.

07:08.906 --> 07:10.430
Because I always
wanted to be like you.

07:10.473 --> 07:12.214
That's why I hung around.

07:12.257 --> 07:14.869
I knew, even if you didn't.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.743
What do you say, Erin?
See any resemblance?

07:19.787 --> 07:21.353
The only thing I see

07:21.397 --> 07:23.704
is a chance to put
Freddy Fallaci in prison.

07:23.747 --> 07:25.053
So let's get to work.

07:27.490 --> 07:29.492
I got you.

07:37.152 --> 07:39.197
Hey, anything from the scene?

07:39.241 --> 07:41.983
No prints, no hairs, no DNA.

07:42.026 --> 07:44.725
Cosgrove is rounding up
a list of the neighbors.

07:44.768 --> 07:46.703
You know, you didn't have
to ride here with her, Reagan.

07:46.727 --> 07:48.816
Well, she lost her mom,
what do you want me to do?

07:48.859 --> 07:50.861
I mean, I've spent the
night in worse places

07:50.905 --> 07:52.820
than a hospital waiting room.

07:52.863 --> 07:54.903
What can I say? I'm a softie
for that kind of thing.

07:56.127 --> 07:57.389
Hey, Doc, what do you got?

07:57.433 --> 07:59.174
She presented
with severe tachycardia

07:59.217 --> 08:00.610
and elevated cortisol.

08:00.654 --> 08:02.220
Okay, can we get
to the headline?

08:02.264 --> 08:03.874
She's stable.
Coming off of her sedation.

08:03.918 --> 08:06.529
Can we speak to her? Gently.

08:10.751 --> 08:12.448
How you feeling, Margo?

08:13.928 --> 08:15.364
I miss my mom.

08:15.407 --> 08:16.887
Okay. I promise you,

08:16.931 --> 08:18.735
we're gonna do everything we can
to find who did this.

08:18.759 --> 08:20.456
But what we need from you

08:20.500 --> 08:22.850
i-is for you to help
walk us through what happened.

08:22.893 --> 08:25.505
Um...

08:25.548 --> 08:27.202
We were eating dinner

08:27.245 --> 08:29.030
and someone banged
on the front door.

08:29.073 --> 08:30.727
Was she expecting anyone,
your mom?

08:30.771 --> 08:33.556
Not that I know of,
but she's on the co-op board,

08:33.600 --> 08:36.645
and people drop by.

08:36.690 --> 08:39.649
She told me to give them
a couple minutes.

08:39.693 --> 08:42.739
Could you hear your mom talking
to this person?

08:42.783 --> 08:44.261
Was it a male or female?

08:44.306 --> 08:47.178
I don't know,
it was muffled, but...

08:47.222 --> 08:50.225
then I heard her yell
and something got knocked over.

08:50.268 --> 08:52.749
I called out
but Mom didn't answer,

08:52.793 --> 08:54.882
and then they started turning
the knob on my door

08:54.925 --> 08:56.448
and I freaked
and got in the closet.

08:56.492 --> 08:58.059
I didn't know what else to do.

08:58.102 --> 09:01.889
Margo, did your mom ever say
that she was scared of anyone?

09:01.932 --> 09:03.760
Anybody threatened her
or anything like that?

09:03.804 --> 09:06.720
No. No. She...

09:06.763 --> 09:09.200
Why would she be?
She never hurt anyone.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.944
Now she's gone.

09:16.077 --> 09:18.470
My God.

09:18.514 --> 09:22.866
Hey. We will be here
for you, okay?

09:22.910 --> 09:24.041
You have my word.

09:24.085 --> 09:25.565
Okay?

09:30.091 --> 09:31.764
I was gonna send him the link
but the account's been deleted,

09:31.788 --> 09:33.181
and the posts.

09:33.224 --> 09:36.358
Maybe I.D. Theft Squad
or Computer Crimes

09:36.401 --> 09:38.926
can track down the IP address
of whoever created the account.

09:38.969 --> 09:41.145
Then I meet the guy at his
house with a baseball bat.

09:41.189 --> 09:43.670
Sergeant Reagan?

09:44.888 --> 09:46.977
Looks like the rat squad
sniffed it out.

09:48.544 --> 09:49.980
All right, relax.

09:50.024 --> 09:52.940
It was all fake... the account,
the post, everything.

09:52.983 --> 09:55.290
This concerns something else.

09:55.333 --> 09:57.988
Let's chat, Sergeant. Alone.

10:02.950 --> 10:04.560
Here's good. What's this about?

10:04.604 --> 10:05.822
Her.

10:07.519 --> 10:09.497
Internal Affairs received
information that Officer Janko

10:09.521 --> 10:11.741
has been attempting
to extract protection money

10:11.785 --> 10:13.090
from a local business.

10:13.134 --> 10:14.091
Yeah, right.

10:14.135 --> 10:15.789
Is this a joke to you?

10:15.832 --> 10:17.331
Eddie taking bribes is.
Who's accusing her?

10:17.355 --> 10:19.053
That's confidential. Let me guess.

10:19.096 --> 10:21.098
It was anonymous.
Maybe on the tip-line?

10:21.142 --> 10:23.927
Eddie Janko has done nothing
wrong; I'd bet my shield on it.

10:23.971 --> 10:25.233
And you wouldn't cover for her?

10:25.276 --> 10:26.713
Come again? Our records show

10:26.756 --> 10:28.018
that you specifically requested

10:28.062 --> 10:29.454
her transfer
from the 12th Precinct

10:29.498 --> 10:30.910
soon after you made
the jump yourself.

10:30.934 --> 10:33.937
Because this place was a zoo
and she's a great cop.

10:33.981 --> 10:35.939
You guys got any other
unfounded suspicions?

10:35.983 --> 10:37.898
Suck it up and ask her yourself.

10:37.941 --> 10:38.855
We'll do just that.

10:38.899 --> 10:40.161
Good.

10:44.948 --> 10:46.907
What? Whoever's gunning for me

10:46.950 --> 10:48.952
is gunning for you, too.

10:51.389 --> 10:52.913
So, the dead guy drew first?

10:52.956 --> 10:55.002
Security footage confirms
he pulled first.

10:55.045 --> 10:57.613
Detective Lynch drew his weapon
and shot him.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.833
Bad guy's gun
slid under a freezer,

10:59.876 --> 11:01.356
so the owner didn't see it.

11:01.399 --> 11:02.966
What about him
harassing the guy?

11:03.010 --> 11:05.708
The only harassment
was Doug recognizing this guy

11:05.752 --> 11:07.449
as a strong-arm robber
he's been after

11:07.492 --> 11:09.407
for years, Ellis Hardwick.

11:09.451 --> 11:10.713
When he asked him for I.D.,

11:10.757 --> 11:12.584
Hardwick goes, "Go to hell."

11:13.673 --> 11:16.806
You know, a lot
of brass showed up,

11:16.850 --> 11:18.895
and only one from the 7-4.

11:18.939 --> 11:19.940
I checked.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.855
Doug's got a lot of friends.

11:21.898 --> 11:25.032
Well, that could almost look
like damage control.

11:25.075 --> 11:26.096
What for? I mean, it's not like

11:26.120 --> 11:28.209
the guy's a drunk
or on the take.

11:28.252 --> 11:30.646
Boss, Doug's a year shy
of getting out,

11:30.690 --> 11:32.996
and this is the first time
he fired his weapon.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.259
A shooting this late
in the game,

11:35.303 --> 11:37.044
especially a fatal one,
can really screw

11:37.087 --> 11:38.175
with a guy's head.

11:38.219 --> 11:39.699
So, how is he?

11:39.742 --> 11:41.048
He's gonna be fine.

11:41.091 --> 11:42.484
And it was a good shoot,

11:42.527 --> 11:44.660
so let's give thanks for that.Yeah.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.053
Yeah.

11:48.185 --> 11:50.579
You know, this guy's file reads

11:50.622 --> 11:52.929
like the greatest hits
of police work.

11:52.973 --> 11:54.409
Solid as they come.

11:54.452 --> 11:56.019
Bring him up.

11:56.063 --> 11:57.020
Bring him up here?

11:57.064 --> 11:58.021
For a cop with his record,

11:58.065 --> 11:59.544
there's very few commendations.

11:59.588 --> 12:01.068
Let's change all that.

12:01.111 --> 12:02.286
Buck him up.

12:02.330 --> 12:03.723
Well, it's just that Doug

12:03.766 --> 12:05.725
never puts himself up
for medals, you know?

12:05.768 --> 12:07.208
He doesn't like
people making a fuss.

12:07.248 --> 12:09.119
But, you know what,
let me talk to him,

12:09.163 --> 12:11.731
see if he's up for it.

12:16.866 --> 12:19.173
What'd I just see?

12:19.216 --> 12:21.175
So, you were the one
who found Mrs. Chan.

12:21.218 --> 12:23.351
Yeah, I was coming
down the hall,

12:23.394 --> 12:25.701
and I saw her door
standing open,

12:25.745 --> 12:27.181
which was weird because she

12:27.224 --> 12:29.096
and the offspring
are pretty private.

12:29.139 --> 12:31.620
And, suddenly, this person
comes blasting out,

12:31.663 --> 12:32.795
knocks me on my ass.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.536
A he or a she? I don't know.

12:34.579 --> 12:36.843
Tall, bundled up,
coat and gloves.

12:36.886 --> 12:39.410
Julie, what did you think

12:39.454 --> 12:40.977
of Mei-Ling Chan?

12:41.021 --> 12:44.764
She was a grade-A
pain in the ass.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.678
Not to speak ill of the dead.

12:46.722 --> 12:49.681
Always ranting about rich kids
invading our building.

12:49.725 --> 12:51.814
I'm on the board, too,
and she yelled at me

12:51.858 --> 12:54.034
on a daily basis.

12:54.077 --> 12:55.600
Must've pissed you off.

12:55.644 --> 12:56.601
When you look like I do,

12:56.645 --> 12:58.386
the plain Janes open fire.

12:58.429 --> 13:00.954
So, you live in the apartment
just below the victim?

13:00.997 --> 13:02.956
And she was always complaining
about my music

13:02.999 --> 13:04.653
coming up
through her floorboards.

13:04.696 --> 13:06.655
And maybe the weed smoke, too?

13:06.698 --> 13:08.875
She retaliated
by stomping around overhead.

13:08.918 --> 13:11.268
Like a furniture rodeo up there,
day and night.

13:11.312 --> 13:12.704
So you hated her.

13:12.748 --> 13:14.881
How did a... unique
fellow like yourself

13:14.924 --> 13:16.804
come to live in
an apartment building like that?

13:16.839 --> 13:17.797
My old man used

13:17.840 --> 13:19.276
to work on Wall Street.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.931
He croaked at his desk.
I inherited the pad.

13:21.975 --> 13:24.891
And there's nothin'
nobody could do about it.

13:24.934 --> 13:26.762
Sarah, we understand

13:26.806 --> 13:28.155
you're a photographer?

13:28.198 --> 13:30.418
And I shoot all over the world,
so I'm rarely here.

13:30.461 --> 13:33.900
But every time I am,
Mei-Ling is pissing someone off.

13:33.943 --> 13:36.337
Like last year,
someone broke into my place

13:36.380 --> 13:38.818
and stole ten grand worth
of prints.

13:38.861 --> 13:40.621
I asked the board to
install hallway cameras,

13:40.645 --> 13:44.084
but Mei-Ling said her privacy
trumped my photos.

13:44.127 --> 13:45.607
That must have made you mad.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.609
Mad enough, maybe, to,

13:47.652 --> 13:50.177
be inspired by one
of your own photos?

13:50.220 --> 13:51.743
I admit I wasn't happy.

13:51.787 --> 13:54.572
But then Mei-Ling helped
a friend of mine

13:54.616 --> 13:56.226
get into the building.

13:56.270 --> 13:58.576
Kinda made me like her a little.

14:02.450 --> 14:04.147
So, I went through past arrests,

14:04.191 --> 14:06.715
looking for perps who might want
to get back at both of us.

14:06.758 --> 14:08.282
And?

14:08.325 --> 14:10.606
And most of 'em are still
locked up, some of 'em are dead.

14:10.632 --> 14:13.243
But I found one guy
who is not only out,

14:13.287 --> 14:15.028
he never so much as
served a day in prison.

14:15.071 --> 14:18.814
And you brought me out
in this mess for...?

14:18.858 --> 14:20.729
Trust me, it's
gonna be worth it.

14:28.258 --> 14:29.564
Don Voorhees?

14:29.607 --> 14:32.045
You got to be kidding me.
Reagan and Janko.

14:32.088 --> 14:34.047
Glad you still remember us, Don.

14:34.090 --> 14:36.701
How could I forget the two
pricks that ruined my life?

14:36.745 --> 14:38.878
No, you ruined your own life
by having your parolees

14:38.921 --> 14:40.314
do your dirty work for you.

14:40.357 --> 14:42.664
And yet you somehow still
managed to squirm away.

14:42.707 --> 14:44.144
I'm free because I'm innocent.

14:44.187 --> 14:46.059
But, still, I'm the only one
that got screwed.

14:46.102 --> 14:47.103
By not going to prison?

14:47.147 --> 14:48.539
There's other punishments.

14:48.583 --> 14:49.845
Corrections fired me.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.083
They took away my pension.
I spent every dime

14:51.107 --> 14:52.587
I had defending myself.

14:52.630 --> 14:54.154
Don, what's going on?

14:54.197 --> 14:56.678
Nothing, sis. Just some trash
blew up to the doorstep.

14:56.721 --> 14:58.332
We're police officers.

14:58.375 --> 14:59.899
So like he said,

14:59.942 --> 15:01.204
trash. Hey, sis,

15:01.248 --> 15:03.163
it turns out you're helping him
come after us,

15:03.206 --> 15:05.513
you're gonna be
in a whole world of hurt, too.

15:05.556 --> 15:06.731
Go to hell.

15:06.775 --> 15:08.995
What is she talking about,
coming after you?

15:09.038 --> 15:10.537
If you are doing
what we think you're doing,

15:10.561 --> 15:12.433
you will go to prison this time.

15:12.476 --> 15:14.391
Wait, let me get this straight.

15:14.435 --> 15:17.568
So somebody is getting
a taste of their own medicine?

15:19.179 --> 15:21.311
Well, hallelujah!

15:21.355 --> 15:23.681
Keep laughing, Don, right back
into another pair of handcuffs.

15:23.705 --> 15:25.750
You need to learn
about double jeopardy,

15:25.794 --> 15:28.492
'cause the only thing you're
coming with is your big mouth

15:28.536 --> 15:30.973
and this little bitch
you bring along for backup.

15:31.017 --> 15:33.628
Hey, you... Hey, just let him
keep laughing.

15:33.671 --> 15:35.151
Keep laughing.

15:36.152 --> 15:37.588
We'll be back, Voorhees.

15:37.632 --> 15:40.069
I'll be waiting for you.

15:46.554 --> 15:48.382
Can I help you? It's okay. I'm her brother.

15:50.036 --> 15:51.602
Hey, sorry, you got a minute?

15:51.646 --> 15:52.908
Yeah, for you, anytime.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.432
How is Don Voorhees
not in prison?

15:55.476 --> 15:57.913
Refresh my memory?

15:57.957 --> 15:59.499
Parole officer
who we arrested last year

15:59.523 --> 16:01.917
for abusing his parolees.
We gift-wrapped him for you.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.788
Yeah, and, somehow,
he got re-gifted.

16:03.832 --> 16:05.703
Right back out on the street. Okay,

16:05.747 --> 16:08.793
I wasn't even quarterback on the
Voorhees case. After I came down here

16:08.837 --> 16:12.101
and I personally walked you
through every single detail

16:12.145 --> 16:13.711
of what he did? Yeah,

16:13.755 --> 16:17.411
but I relayed it to an excellent
A.D.A. who took it to trial.

16:17.454 --> 16:18.760
Erin, you handed it off?

16:18.803 --> 16:20.153
Yeah, but I tracked it.

16:20.196 --> 16:22.503
Look, all of his victims
were ex-cons,

16:22.546 --> 16:24.244
none of which would testify.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.072
And he's... or was...

16:26.115 --> 16:28.204
A law enforcement officer,
all right? So,

16:28.248 --> 16:29.989
all that adds up to...

16:30.032 --> 16:31.599
you find a jury
that would convict.

16:31.642 --> 16:33.079
So, I'm sorry.

16:33.122 --> 16:35.733
Well, "sorry" means that
he's still out on the street.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.042
What is this really about?

16:40.086 --> 16:41.652
We think Voorhees wants payback.

16:41.696 --> 16:44.046
He sicced IAB, maybe,
on-on Eddie...

16:44.090 --> 16:45.352
He's trying to smear Jamie

16:45.395 --> 16:48.311
by posting racist
propaganda under his name.

16:48.355 --> 16:50.009
And you have hard evidence
of that?

16:50.052 --> 16:51.401
It's on SquawkTalk.

16:51.445 --> 16:52.576
That it was Voorhees?

16:52.620 --> 16:54.448
Wow, okay,
that's where your mind goes?

16:54.491 --> 16:55.971
Of course he walked.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.253
Okay, easy. You know,
I thought that,

16:57.277 --> 16:58.495
you guys,

16:58.539 --> 17:00.212
you're supposed
to look out for each other.

17:00.236 --> 17:01.063
Easy.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.456
Eddie.

17:02.499 --> 17:05.067
Never mind.

17:14.294 --> 17:16.078
Lieutenant, you get a heads-up?

17:16.122 --> 17:18.211
No, Detective, I did not.

17:18.253 --> 17:20.952
I mean, don't get me wrong.
This is quite an honor.

17:20.996 --> 17:23.694
It's not every day you get
the PC himself dropping by.

17:23.738 --> 17:25.348
Tends to disrupt the day,

17:25.392 --> 17:27.046
you get a call I'm coming in.

17:29.309 --> 17:31.441
Help me out, Doug. Have we met?

17:31.485 --> 17:33.922
You certainly must have been
in the same room at one point.

17:33.965 --> 17:35.358
Nice to meet you.

17:35.402 --> 17:37.186
And you.

17:37.230 --> 17:38.622
And I think I have good news.

17:38.666 --> 17:41.103
You've been cleared
in the bodega shooting.

17:41.147 --> 17:43.279
Well...

17:43.323 --> 17:44.672
Doug's nothing if not modest.

17:44.715 --> 17:47.196
Excuse me, I was talking to him.

17:47.240 --> 17:50.199
I'd been after Ellis Hardwick
for years.

17:50.243 --> 17:53.159
Felt... good to finally get him.

17:53.202 --> 17:56.510
And he will never
hurt anyone again,

17:56.553 --> 18:00.209
which is why I'm recommending
you for the Combat Cross.

18:00.253 --> 18:01.950
Doug's a little light

18:01.993 --> 18:02.951
on awards.

18:02.994 --> 18:04.518
I think we need to fix that.

18:04.561 --> 18:05.930
I don't know
where my dress blues are

18:05.954 --> 18:07.627
off the top of my head,
but I'm sure a quick recon

18:07.651 --> 18:09.218
of the hall closet... Just say thanks,

18:09.262 --> 18:10.567
Detective.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.003
Of course.

18:12.047 --> 18:13.701
Thank you, Commissioner Reagan.

18:13.744 --> 18:15.964
I am also reinstating you
to full duty.

18:16.007 --> 18:18.009
No more house mouse.

18:18.053 --> 18:19.378
That'd be great. But, Doug, who else

18:19.402 --> 18:21.752
has your hawk eye
for logging evidence?

18:21.796 --> 18:24.973
Surely, we can use a detective
of his caliber on the street.

18:25.016 --> 18:26.061
Yes, sir, of course.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.715
Would you excuse us a moment?

18:27.758 --> 18:31.197
I'll be in my office
if you need anything else, sir.

18:33.242 --> 18:34.809
So, Doug,

18:34.852 --> 18:38.073
I'm sitting in my office
the other day,

18:38.117 --> 18:40.728
and, you know,
it occurred to me,

18:40.771 --> 18:42.643
it's been so long
since I made an arrest,

18:42.686 --> 18:45.733
I'm not sure
I could Mirandize someone.

18:45.776 --> 18:49.128
Read me my rights.

18:49.171 --> 18:51.217
Sir?

18:51.260 --> 18:54.263
Come on. Just for fun.

18:55.308 --> 18:57.962
You have the right
to remain silent.

18:58.006 --> 18:59.703
Anything you say...

18:59.747 --> 19:02.706
can be held against you
in a court of law.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.273
And will be.

19:04.317 --> 19:07.363
You're right to consult
an attorney.

19:07.407 --> 19:09.974
And right...

19:14.196 --> 19:18.766
Have the right to life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness.

19:24.598 --> 19:26.382
Well done.

19:26.426 --> 19:27.818
Thank you.

19:27.862 --> 19:31.082
Brought back some memories.

19:33.998 --> 19:35.783
Again, Doug,

19:35.826 --> 19:37.524
congratulations.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.700
Thank you, sir.

19:45.009 --> 19:47.273
Have you been eating?

19:47.316 --> 19:48.796
Noodles. Noodles?

19:48.839 --> 19:51.146
Look, after this,
I'm gonna take you to lunch,

19:51.190 --> 19:53.168
and we'll get you something
more substantial, okay?

19:53.192 --> 19:55.106
Have a seat over here.

19:55.150 --> 19:57.283
Okay, so none
of the co-op's outside cameras

19:57.326 --> 20:00.286
saw anyone leave in the moments
after your mother's murder.

20:00.329 --> 20:02.331
So we want you to listen

20:02.375 --> 20:04.266
to the interviews we had
with some of your neighbors.

20:04.290 --> 20:05.595
We had our techs muffle
the audio

20:05.639 --> 20:07.269
so it sounds
like it's coming through a wall.

20:07.293 --> 20:09.164
We're hoping you might be able

20:09.208 --> 20:12.820
to recognize one of the voices
as the voice you heard.

20:12.863 --> 20:15.126
Okay? Okay.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.738
Last year,

20:17.781 --> 20:18.869
someone broke into my place

20:18.913 --> 20:21.002
and stole ten grand worth
of prints.

20:21.045 --> 20:23.309
I asked the board
to install hallway cameras...

20:23.352 --> 20:25.180
No, voice is too high.

20:27.356 --> 20:29.706
I was coming
down the hall, and I saw

20:29.750 --> 20:31.273
her door standing open...

20:31.317 --> 20:32.709
Not that one either.

20:32.753 --> 20:33.928
Sorry.

20:33.971 --> 20:35.146
No pressure.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.194
She retaliated
by stomping around overhead.

20:39.238 --> 20:42.763
Like a furniture rodeo up there,
day and night.

20:42.806 --> 20:44.330
My God, no.

20:44.373 --> 20:45.766
No, what?

20:45.809 --> 20:47.202
It's this one. It's this one.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.813
You sure? Yes.

20:49.857 --> 20:52.207
Our Satan-loving metalhead.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.426
Yeah.

20:53.469 --> 20:55.297
So-so what happens now?

20:55.341 --> 20:57.734
He killed my mom, so you can
go arrest him now, right?

20:57.778 --> 20:59.345
Unfortunately,

20:59.388 --> 21:02.217
we don't have enough of what
we call probable cause, but...

21:02.261 --> 21:05.612
What? But we-we are getting closer.

21:07.527 --> 21:09.268
And we're getting closer
thanks to you.

21:12.967 --> 21:15.317
Once you're in there,
get Fallaci talking

21:15.361 --> 21:16.927
about who he imports from,

21:16.971 --> 21:18.929
how his distro works.

21:18.973 --> 21:20.366
Anthony, this guy's

21:20.409 --> 21:21.367
real paranoid.

21:21.410 --> 21:22.890
What if he finds the device?

21:22.933 --> 21:25.719
Just say the code word, and
we're there in no time flat.

21:25.762 --> 21:27.242
The way you waddle?

21:27.286 --> 21:29.288
Ain't lost anyone yet,
smart-ass.

21:29.331 --> 21:32.029
And, we pull this off, we'll
go back to the old neighborhood,

21:32.073 --> 21:33.770
get a little surf 'n' turf
at Donzi's.

21:33.814 --> 21:35.337
Now you're talkin'.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.383
There you go. Okay,

21:37.426 --> 21:38.819
you get going.

21:38.862 --> 21:41.691
Let me run my boss through
what we got planned.

21:41.735 --> 21:42.518
Later, brother.

21:42.562 --> 21:43.562
Okay, pal.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.522
Hey, Ms. Reagan.Leo.

21:50.352 --> 21:52.572
You guys are thick
as thieves in here already.

21:52.615 --> 21:54.313
Hey, the kid can put it away,

21:54.356 --> 21:56.358
just like me. Well,

21:56.402 --> 22:00.188
while you were breaking bread,
did he happen to come clean?

22:00.231 --> 22:01.189
About?

22:01.232 --> 22:02.973
Ran Leo's name
through Narcotics.

22:03.017 --> 22:04.627
Why would you do that?

22:04.671 --> 22:08.239
Because getting background
on an informant is important.

22:08.283 --> 22:11.242
Turns out he's not a nobody
like he claims he is.

22:11.286 --> 22:13.244
Turns out he actually
works muscle for Fallaci

22:13.288 --> 22:15.334
and almost beat a...

22:15.377 --> 22:17.423
rival drug dealer
to death last year.

22:17.466 --> 22:19.381
Kid never said he was the Pope.

22:19.425 --> 22:23.298
Just don't forget that this
is about nailing Fallaci.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.604
Which is what we're gonna do.

22:24.647 --> 22:27.476
So you and me have nothing else
to talk about.

22:45.668 --> 22:47.670
What is it? Early
onset Alzheimer's?

22:47.714 --> 22:49.498
Vascular dementia?

22:49.542 --> 22:50.891
Don't know.

22:50.934 --> 22:52.936
He won't go to the doctor.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.853
And quitting before
he reaches retirement

22:56.897 --> 22:59.116
leaves a lot on the table.

22:59.160 --> 23:01.249
Andno medical benefits.

23:01.292 --> 23:03.599
We're just trying to get him
across the finish line, boss.

23:03.643 --> 23:05.949
He's given his
whole life to the job.

23:08.082 --> 23:10.345
Now yours hangs in the balance.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.392
Nothing we did is a violation.

23:14.393 --> 23:17.004
You lied to me. Twice.

23:18.005 --> 23:20.268
And I shouldn't have done that.

23:20.311 --> 23:22.444
And I'm sorry about that.

23:22.488 --> 23:25.099
I put Doug first.

23:26.143 --> 23:28.668
I am ordering
Force Investigation

23:28.711 --> 23:31.235
to look into the shooting again.

23:31.279 --> 23:32.802
You think I lied
about that, too?

23:32.846 --> 23:34.848
You tell me.

23:35.892 --> 23:37.546
It was a good shoot.

23:37.590 --> 23:39.548
And Doug Lynch is a good man.

23:39.592 --> 23:43.552
I don't care about me,
but have a heart about him.

23:46.425 --> 23:47.991
How about this?

23:48.035 --> 23:49.993
You don't tell me
to have a heart,

23:50.037 --> 23:52.256
and I don't tell you
to use your head.

23:52.300 --> 23:54.563
You don't lie or mislead
your boss,

23:54.607 --> 23:57.392
not on this, not on anything,

23:57.436 --> 23:59.089
not ever.

24:09.317 --> 24:12.146
Hey. How'd it go with IAB?

24:12.189 --> 24:14.322
They told me I was
taking bribes,

24:14.365 --> 24:16.629
and I told them
they could stuff it.

24:16.672 --> 24:18.631
Where are we at with
Computer Crimes?

24:18.674 --> 24:20.459
Still trying to confirm
if it was Voorhees

24:20.502 --> 24:22.045
that created the fake
SquawkTalk account,

24:22.069 --> 24:23.505
and they're trying
to link his phone

24:23.549 --> 24:26.508
to the one that called
the IAB tip-line about you.

24:26.552 --> 24:29.293
Well, what if we checked in
with some of his old parolees?

24:29.337 --> 24:31.295
Maybe he's leaning on
one of them for this.

24:31.339 --> 24:33.384
Yeah. Or we could visit
his... his work.

24:33.428 --> 24:35.386
Maybe he's using their computer.

24:35.430 --> 24:37.388
Yeah. He's got a company phone.

24:37.432 --> 24:40.130
Yeah, I'll... I'll get into it.

24:40.174 --> 24:42.219
You mean we'llget into it.

24:42.263 --> 24:44.657
Eddie, IAB could
already be tailing you.

24:44.700 --> 24:46.223
If they know
that we're a couple,

24:46.267 --> 24:48.356
it's gonna look bad
that I vouched for you.

24:48.399 --> 24:51.141
I shouldn't have even taken you
to the house yesterday,

24:51.185 --> 24:53.753
you know? Well, then you would've
got your ass kicked.

24:53.796 --> 24:56.451
Look, we'll just steer clear
of each other in public,

24:56.495 --> 24:58.975
and then, with any luck,
maybe getting in Voorhees' face

24:59.019 --> 25:01.325
was enough to make him
back off altogether.

25:01.369 --> 25:03.414
Jamie.

25:03.458 --> 25:05.808
Not your car.

25:15.557 --> 25:17.428
I'm just saying,

25:17.472 --> 25:19.272
someone shows up out of the blue
and announces

25:19.300 --> 25:21.737
that you're siblings...
That's a shock to the system

25:21.781 --> 25:23.260
that you don't get over.

25:23.304 --> 25:25.001
I would. What?

25:25.045 --> 25:26.786
Get over it. I mean,
my dad's been living

25:26.829 --> 25:29.832
double lives most of his life,
so I'd probably be more like,

25:29.876 --> 25:32.400
"Of course
I have a half brother."

25:32.443 --> 25:34.576
That must be a tough way to
have to look at the world.

25:34.620 --> 25:37.623
My mom said it prepared me
for "life's rich pageant."

25:40.016 --> 25:41.409
Well, is this Leo a nice guy?

25:41.452 --> 25:43.367
Nice? I don't know if he's nice.

25:43.411 --> 25:46.501
He's like Anthony if Anthony
took a wrong turn somewhere.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.242
So in other words,

25:48.285 --> 25:50.461
he's a moronic, walking,
talking case of heartburn

25:50.505 --> 25:52.376
but with a criminal record.

25:52.420 --> 25:53.464
Ha-ha.

25:53.508 --> 25:54.901
Does Anthony like him?

25:54.944 --> 25:56.772
Loves him. Literally like...

25:56.816 --> 25:58.469
a long-lost brother.

25:58.513 --> 25:59.906
Well, of course he does.

25:59.949 --> 26:02.125
Blood is blood,
come right down to it.

26:02.169 --> 26:03.431
Are you staying out of it?

26:03.474 --> 26:04.650
Am I staying out of what?

26:04.693 --> 26:06.608
Out of trying to steer
Anthony's reaction

26:06.652 --> 26:08.741
to this new person in his life.

26:08.784 --> 26:10.525
Now, why would you ask me that?

26:10.569 --> 26:11.787
A lifetime of knowing you.

26:11.831 --> 26:13.397
Gee, thanks, Dad.

26:13.441 --> 26:15.312
I don't know, I think it'd be

26:15.356 --> 26:17.227
pretty cool
to have a new brother show up.

26:17.271 --> 26:18.620
How quickly they forget.

26:18.664 --> 26:20.274
No, I just miss the company.

26:20.317 --> 26:21.492
And Jack can't be around,

26:21.536 --> 26:22.842
so having another brother

26:22.885 --> 26:25.584
around my age...
might not be a bad thing.

26:25.627 --> 26:26.759
What about a sister?

26:26.802 --> 26:28.282
You already got that covered.

26:28.325 --> 26:30.980
Kiddo, some half brother of
yours shows up out of nowhere,

26:31.024 --> 26:33.635
I'm gonna have a serious talk
with your mother's grave.

26:33.679 --> 26:34.984
Uncle Danny!

26:35.028 --> 26:36.116
What?

26:36.159 --> 26:37.726
Me, I'm with Erin.

26:37.770 --> 26:39.356
Someone comes along and upends
everything you thought you knew

26:39.380 --> 26:41.382
about your family,
I'm not sure I'd want to know.

26:41.425 --> 26:44.646
That is one bullet I
promise you've dodged.

26:44.690 --> 26:45.952
And I'm with Anthony.

26:45.995 --> 26:49.085
Grab what life tosses you;
Make the most of it.

26:49.129 --> 26:53.176
You got a bigger family.

26:53.220 --> 26:54.569
Yeah, but even that way?

26:54.613 --> 26:57.441
Why not? Boil it down,
you got one more person

26:57.485 --> 26:59.443
you can count on in the end.

26:59.487 --> 27:01.663
I mean, who wouldn't
be grateful for that?

27:01.707 --> 27:03.665
I'm grateful for these potatoes.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.850
Okay, I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.

27:14.894 --> 27:16.547
I...

27:16.591 --> 27:18.549
I shouldn't have snapped at you.

27:18.593 --> 27:19.899
No. I...

27:19.942 --> 27:21.137
should have handled the
Voorhees case myself.

27:21.161 --> 27:22.684
I know it was
important to you guys.

27:22.728 --> 27:25.687
And, I don't know,
I guess I'm just so...

27:25.731 --> 27:27.994
used to everyone
judging my decisions.

27:28.037 --> 27:30.474
I mean, Danny makes a
hobby out of it, so...

27:30.518 --> 27:31.998
But it wasn't my place.

27:32.041 --> 27:33.390
True. You're not family

27:33.434 --> 27:36.045
until you say the I-do's, but...

27:36.089 --> 27:38.700
go ahead, have at me.

27:38.744 --> 27:42.661
Nah. We're outnumbered
in that table as it is.

27:42.704 --> 27:44.706
I shouldn't have
barged in to your office,

27:44.750 --> 27:46.403
guns blazing,

27:46.447 --> 27:48.971
and I'm sorry.

27:50.494 --> 27:53.933
Well, I mean it.
I'm apologizing.

27:53.976 --> 27:56.544
I grew up with three brothers,

27:56.587 --> 27:59.547
so whenever there was a beef
that deserved an apology

27:59.590 --> 28:02.506
from one of them, it usually came
with a dozen self-serving amendments,

28:02.550 --> 28:04.421
so this is...

28:04.465 --> 28:06.859
this is nice.

28:07.903 --> 28:10.079
You want me to do it again?

28:10.123 --> 28:12.081
Yeah.

28:12.125 --> 28:14.736
I'm sorry. My bad.

28:14.780 --> 28:16.564
Me, too.

28:17.652 --> 28:19.567
You're okay.

28:26.443 --> 28:28.097
Hey, boss. Yeah?

28:28.141 --> 28:29.446
Sign this?

28:29.490 --> 28:30.578
Yeah.

28:30.621 --> 28:32.841
Any word from Voorhees' job?

28:32.885 --> 28:35.409
Yeah, only that his boss
also thinks he's a creep.

28:35.452 --> 28:36.932
And his parolees
aren't helping him.

28:36.976 --> 28:39.761
They still got PTSD from
what he did to them before.

28:39.805 --> 28:42.155
So we got to keep up the charade.
Yeah.

28:42.198 --> 28:44.940
And watch our backs
in the meantime.

28:44.984 --> 28:46.289
Thanks.

28:46.333 --> 28:48.422
Now you got to be.

28:48.465 --> 28:49.771
Help you, sir?

28:49.815 --> 28:52.252
Yeah. I'd like
to make a complaint

28:52.295 --> 28:54.994
against two
of your officers. Them.

28:55.037 --> 28:56.778
Reagan and Janko, for...

28:56.822 --> 28:59.389
repeated and malicious
harassment.

28:59.433 --> 29:00.802
What the hell
are you talking about, Voorhees?

29:00.826 --> 29:02.566
Yeah, you got it
exactly backwards.

29:02.610 --> 29:03.916
They came to my house

29:03.959 --> 29:05.700
and made defamatory statements

29:05.744 --> 29:07.789
against me
in front of my family.

29:07.833 --> 29:10.531
And then they go
to my place of work and make

29:10.574 --> 29:12.707
false accusations against
me, so that by the time

29:12.751 --> 29:14.578
I get there, I lose my job!

29:14.622 --> 29:16.885
So they need to lose
their job, too.

29:16.929 --> 29:18.626
Sir, that's not up to me,

29:18.669 --> 29:20.671
but I can take your statement
and refer it

29:20.715 --> 29:22.543
to the Civilian Complaint
Review Board. Good.

29:22.586 --> 29:23.936
Then I'll have their jobs.

29:23.979 --> 29:26.416
Not a word of what he's saying
is true... not "the"

29:26.460 --> 29:28.418
or "and" or "I."See? He's
doing it again,

29:28.462 --> 29:31.726
right here and now... he's
defaming me right here and now!

29:31.770 --> 29:34.207
They need to pay for what they
been putting me through.

29:34.250 --> 29:36.252
Go on, write it down.

29:37.340 --> 29:38.820
Straight from the M.E.'s office.

29:38.864 --> 29:40.256
Thanks.

29:40.300 --> 29:42.128
Medical examiner?

29:42.171 --> 29:43.651
What's that?

29:43.694 --> 29:46.436
It's nothing.

29:46.480 --> 29:49.265
Or nothing you want to tell me.

29:49.309 --> 29:51.006
Okay, look.

29:52.703 --> 29:54.836
I ran a DNA test on you and Leo.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.403
I'm not sure I heard you right.

29:56.446 --> 29:58.797
From the soda that you guys
left in the conference room.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.973
We're about to make
a big move on Fallaci.

30:01.016 --> 30:03.323
We need to make
sure we can trust

30:03.366 --> 30:04.977
that Leo's on the up-and-up.

30:05.020 --> 30:07.457
You more than anyone. You know, Erin,

30:07.501 --> 30:10.069
I've been in this business
a long time,

30:10.112 --> 30:13.812
and I know I can trust my gut
even if you can't.

30:17.641 --> 30:20.601
So unless you want to stab me
in the back some more,

30:20.644 --> 30:21.950
me and Leo, we're gonna go catch

30:21.994 --> 30:24.300
the realbad guy.

30:29.784 --> 30:31.394
What the hell are we even doing

30:31.438 --> 30:33.570
back here? 911 got five phone calls.

30:33.614 --> 30:35.921
The neighbor's saying Conrad
killed Ms. Chan.

30:35.964 --> 30:37.444
They're smart.

30:37.487 --> 30:39.272
Hey. Step aside. All right. Police.

30:39.315 --> 30:40.795
Move. Move!

30:40.839 --> 30:42.101
Hey, back up. Okay, back up.

30:45.800 --> 30:46.757
Conrad!

30:46.801 --> 30:48.324
It's Detective Reagan! Open up!

30:48.368 --> 30:50.544
Forget it! They're
trying to break my door down!

30:50.587 --> 30:51.893
He killed her, I'm telling you!

30:51.937 --> 30:53.808
Shut up! Move back and shut up!

30:53.852 --> 30:57.420
Hey, the only one gonna break your
door down is me you don't open it.

30:58.682 --> 31:00.684
Hey, shut up!

31:00.728 --> 31:01.816
Shut up!

31:01.860 --> 31:03.731
Hey, you better
get 'em out of here,

31:03.774 --> 31:05.167
or I'm gonna start
bustin' heads!

31:05.211 --> 31:06.647
Threatening neighbors now?

31:06.690 --> 31:08.692
Great. The only one getting
out of here is you. Go.

31:16.962 --> 31:20.182
But I didn't
murder that lady. Says the dirtbag

31:20.226 --> 31:21.812
who was about to get violent
with his neighbors.

31:21.836 --> 31:23.751
Well, those bastards
were coming after me.

31:23.794 --> 31:25.666
They didn't lay a finger
on you... unlike you

31:25.709 --> 31:28.277
laying all ten of yours
around Ms. Chan's neck.

31:28.321 --> 31:32.455
Hey, pothead, you know
you feel guilty about this.

31:32.499 --> 31:35.154
You know it's all building up
inside of you,

31:35.197 --> 31:37.069
so why don't you relieve
some of that stress

31:37.112 --> 31:39.375
and do us all a favor.
Just fess up.

31:39.419 --> 31:41.769
I didn't kill her, I swear to God.
Hey!

31:41.812 --> 31:44.728
You're not allowed
to use the Lord's name in vain.

31:45.773 --> 31:47.862
I-I... I can prove it.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.124
No, I-I was doing

31:49.168 --> 31:51.083
my music blog
when she got killed.

31:51.126 --> 31:52.780
You didn't say that
the other day.

31:52.823 --> 31:54.956
No, you didn't.Yeah, because...

31:55.000 --> 31:58.873
Because what? Because I smoke too much
weed, and I forget things.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.222
But check my computer.

32:00.266 --> 32:01.571
You'll see I was live

32:01.615 --> 32:02.833
for two hours.

32:02.877 --> 32:05.184
Look at the... the-the...
the time code!

32:05.227 --> 32:07.926
Or maybe you just
forgot strangling her

32:07.969 --> 32:09.928
'cause you smoke too much weed.

32:11.755 --> 32:13.148
No weed's that good.

32:13.192 --> 32:15.194
You stay put.

32:16.978 --> 32:19.111
Do not tell me that
you believe that crap.

32:19.154 --> 32:21.678
It's easy to check,
and if he's got an alibi...?

32:21.722 --> 32:23.680
What do you mean? Strangling someone
takes rage.

32:23.724 --> 32:26.901
You don't think
that animal has rage?

32:26.945 --> 32:28.903
It's a crime of passion.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.992
That guy's just a stoner
and a slider.

32:31.036 --> 32:33.081
Besides, how did that mob know
to go after him?

32:33.125 --> 32:35.954
Somebody would have had
to tell 'em, right?

32:38.478 --> 32:40.697
Yes.

32:40.741 --> 32:43.004
Somebody would.

32:43.048 --> 32:46.225
And it would have to be somebody
we haven't had our eyes on.

32:49.663 --> 32:51.621
Hey, Eddie?

32:51.665 --> 32:53.014
Computer Crimes confirmed

32:53.058 --> 32:55.756
the IP address that
created the fake account came

32:55.799 --> 32:57.018
from Voorhees' place.

32:57.062 --> 32:58.628
And TARU said it
was Voorhees' phone

32:58.672 --> 33:00.021
that called the IAB tip-line.

33:00.065 --> 33:01.457
Are you hearing me?

33:01.501 --> 33:04.025
We got enough to get
this son of a bitch.

33:04.069 --> 33:05.244
I don't know, Jamie.

33:05.287 --> 33:06.854
You... you don't know what?

33:06.897 --> 33:09.161
If it's Voorhees
secretly coming after us,

33:09.204 --> 33:12.773
why would he publicly waltz
in here and file a complaint?

33:12.816 --> 33:14.427
Because the guy's a psycho.

33:14.470 --> 33:16.429
That's not Voorhees' style.

33:16.472 --> 33:18.257
He doesn't do things
out in the open.

33:18.300 --> 33:20.172
He is always hiding
behind someone else.

33:20.215 --> 33:22.652
Yeah, well, if not
him, then who?

33:22.696 --> 33:25.438
Somebody who had access
to his computer

33:25.481 --> 33:28.658
and his phone
just lying around the house.

33:43.673 --> 33:46.633
I'm sorry, Doug. I tried.

33:46.676 --> 33:49.201
Try?

33:51.812 --> 33:53.988
Sid, you did it.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.121
Did what?

33:56.164 --> 33:58.123
One PP called down.

33:58.166 --> 34:00.516
I can retire with
line-of-duty pension

34:00.560 --> 34:02.518
and full medical for life...

34:02.562 --> 34:04.781
because of what you found.

34:04.825 --> 34:06.827
What I found?

34:11.136 --> 34:13.616
Sid,

34:13.659 --> 34:16.010
if next time you see
me, I'm not myself,

34:16.054 --> 34:18.056
please know this.

34:20.884 --> 34:23.409
You saved what's left
of the rest of my life,

34:23.452 --> 34:26.803
and I can never thank
you enough for that.

34:34.681 --> 34:36.074
Aah!

34:36.117 --> 34:38.119
Grab me another one, all right?

34:47.650 --> 34:49.391
You're here to harass me again?

34:49.435 --> 34:50.958
No, to apologize.

34:51.001 --> 34:52.351
It wasn't you.

34:52.393 --> 34:54.004
Really? You're not here
to arrest me?

34:54.047 --> 34:56.094
Nope. Can we come in?

35:03.101 --> 35:04.102
We're here to arrest her.

35:06.016 --> 35:07.714
It was your sister
who set you up.

35:07.757 --> 35:09.281
What? Hey, we get it.

35:09.324 --> 35:10.673
Growing up with a bottom-feeder

35:10.717 --> 35:12.066
like him must've
been a nightmare.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.763
Then he loses everything,
demands

35:13.807 --> 35:14.982
to move into your house?

35:15.025 --> 35:15.983
Yeah, what else
did he do, Heidi?

35:16.026 --> 35:17.178
Did he borrow
some money from you

35:17.202 --> 35:18.396
you knew you'd never get back?

35:18.420 --> 35:20.161
Or did he, did he
drink, and did he...

35:20.205 --> 35:23.121
did he push you around? You're crazy,
because I never said that.

35:23.164 --> 35:25.993
No, she took your computer and
your cell phone to smear us.

35:26.036 --> 35:27.995
But you weren't exactly
a criminal mastermind.

35:28.038 --> 35:30.040
You did enough to implicate him.

35:30.084 --> 35:31.496
Don, just-just throw them
the hell out!

35:31.520 --> 35:33.696
Except I caught you

35:33.740 --> 35:36.177
with both of those
a couple of times.

35:36.221 --> 35:38.223
I-I was just borrowing them.

35:38.266 --> 35:39.485
To do what?

35:39.528 --> 35:42.096
To do nothing.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.185
To set me up, Heidi?! Hey.

35:44.229 --> 35:46.187
All right. I'm cool. Cut it out.

35:46.231 --> 35:47.928
You always hurt people, Don.

35:47.971 --> 35:49.103
And you always

35:49.147 --> 35:51.105
get away with it
your whole life!

35:51.149 --> 35:53.063
God, they're right.

35:53.107 --> 35:54.804
You do belong in prison.

35:54.848 --> 35:56.632
Me? What did I do? See?

35:56.676 --> 35:58.112
You always play the victim,

35:58.156 --> 36:00.506
and you turn the knife
in everyone else.

36:00.549 --> 36:02.203
But I'm your brother! Hey.

36:02.247 --> 36:04.858
All right! Easy. Back up. Back up.

36:04.901 --> 36:07.034
Let's go.

36:07.077 --> 36:09.167
Because I don't even
care anymore!

36:09.210 --> 36:11.038
You-you just got
to get me away from him.

36:11.081 --> 36:13.736
All right. Come on,
let's go. Come on.

36:24.443 --> 36:26.096
Detectives.

36:26.140 --> 36:28.447
Come... come in?

36:32.494 --> 36:34.540
Hope we're not intruding.

36:34.583 --> 36:36.019
Not at all.

36:36.063 --> 36:38.283
Really? Seems like you were
expecting someone else.

36:38.326 --> 36:40.110
Maybe even celebrating
something?

36:40.154 --> 36:41.175
I was just having some food.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.157
Like you were just

36:43.201 --> 36:46.116
the pitiful young daughter
grieving her dead mom.

36:46.160 --> 36:48.118
And I'm the clown
that believed you.

36:48.162 --> 36:49.816
I told you the truth.

36:49.859 --> 36:52.210
No, you didn't. But it's okay.
I did it to myself.

36:52.253 --> 36:53.472
The store was crazy,

36:53.515 --> 36:54.951
but you're gonna love this red.

36:54.995 --> 36:56.170
Don't uncork that

36:56.214 --> 36:57.563
just yet. Set it down.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.570
You were saying, Margo?

37:04.613 --> 37:06.267
Saying what?

37:06.311 --> 37:07.766
Well, you were gonna
tell us the truth.

37:07.790 --> 37:09.227
You were gonna

37:09.270 --> 37:11.161
tell us what happened
to your mom once and for all.

37:11.185 --> 37:13.579
I don't know what
you're talking about. Yes, you do.

37:13.622 --> 37:15.513
You know everyone
in the building hated your mom,

37:15.537 --> 37:17.017
including you.

37:17.060 --> 37:19.038
But they were done with her
once she slammed the door

37:19.062 --> 37:21.282
in their face.
You, on the other hand...

37:21.326 --> 37:23.676
You've had to live
under the same roof with her

37:23.719 --> 37:26.722
for your entire life, and you
finally had enough, didn't you?

37:28.202 --> 37:31.771
You have no idea
how she pushed me all my life.

37:33.207 --> 37:35.862
About school or grades

37:35.905 --> 37:39.953
or learning that stupid cello
when I was five.

37:39.996 --> 37:41.868
The other night,
I told her about Logan,

37:41.911 --> 37:44.958
and she forbid me from talking
to him, so I just...

37:45.001 --> 37:46.916
I just grabbed her
around her neck.

37:46.960 --> 37:50.006
Grabbed her around her neck,
and you strangled her to death?

37:52.182 --> 37:54.054
And you got this sucker to...

37:54.097 --> 37:56.230
cover for you.Hey. She didn't sucker me,
all right.

37:56.274 --> 37:57.947
Shut up. I wanted to keep her away
from that lunatic.

37:57.971 --> 37:59.320
Get him out of here.

37:59.364 --> 38:02.062
See?

38:02.105 --> 38:04.194
He loves me. We love each other.

38:04.238 --> 38:07.197
That's something I've never felt
in my entire life from anyone.

38:07.241 --> 38:11.245
Love is what good people feel
for each other, no matter what.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.203
Maybe you'll learn
that one day. Come on.

38:13.247 --> 38:15.510
I just... Come on.

38:23.344 --> 38:25.215
Congratulations.

38:25.259 --> 38:27.609
I saw the tape
on you taking down Fallaci.

38:27.653 --> 38:31.961
Looks like, Leo's wire
got everything we needed.

38:32.962 --> 38:35.051
Another day at the office.

38:37.053 --> 38:38.707
I owe you an apology.

38:38.751 --> 38:41.362
I should never have run
that DNA test.

38:41.406 --> 38:43.756
It was a mistake,
personally and professionally.

38:43.799 --> 38:45.497
I went to fish it

38:45.540 --> 38:47.934
out of the trash
to run it through the shredder,

38:47.977 --> 38:50.502
and the night crew
had already gotten to it.

38:57.422 --> 38:59.815
Then it's a good thing
I fished it out.

38:59.859 --> 39:02.122
So?

39:12.654 --> 39:14.961
Come on. You're killing me.

39:16.005 --> 39:17.703
It's a match.

39:17.746 --> 39:19.661
The DNA proves it.

39:19.705 --> 39:21.707
Wow.

39:21.750 --> 39:24.100
That's... that's great.

39:25.450 --> 39:28.278
Leo's lucky
to have a brother like you.

39:28.322 --> 39:30.585
Till he finds what comes next.

39:30.629 --> 39:32.195
What do you mean?

39:32.239 --> 39:34.328
Kid's done some bad things.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.243
And he wasn't upfront with us.

39:36.286 --> 39:39.028
And if he thinks he's gonna get
away with that scot-free...

39:39.072 --> 39:40.354
Then, big brother's
gonna teach him

39:40.378 --> 39:42.205
how to straighten up
and fly right?

39:42.249 --> 39:44.469
Comes with the job.

39:59.309 --> 40:01.399
You don't need to knock, Sid.

40:05.707 --> 40:08.057
I figured
you might be coming up.

40:09.058 --> 40:11.060
So you know.

40:11.104 --> 40:12.410
I dropped by to see Doug.

40:12.453 --> 40:14.803
I know I shouldn't have,
but I did.

40:14.847 --> 40:17.676
But... what am I missing?

40:17.719 --> 40:20.983
I just took another look
at his file,

40:21.027 --> 40:24.334
particularly a hostage rescue
early in his career.

40:24.378 --> 40:26.685
He hit his head
trying to tackle a perp.

40:26.728 --> 40:28.513
Pretty serious concussion.

40:30.384 --> 40:32.386
And it seems to me,

40:32.430 --> 40:35.476
a line-of-duty injury like that
could have contributed

40:35.520 --> 40:37.391
to his decline.

40:37.435 --> 40:41.090
So, I just leaned in
on it a little,

40:41.134 --> 40:43.353
till I got it signed off.

40:43.397 --> 40:44.790
Giving him his pension

40:44.833 --> 40:47.096
and medical for the rest
of his life.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.710
For a minute there,
I had a heart.

40:51.753 --> 40:54.060
Wish you could've seen it.

40:56.584 --> 40:58.543
Yeah.

40:58.586 --> 41:01.023
I'm sorry about that, boss.

41:04.462 --> 41:07.508
You try to play me again,

41:07.552 --> 41:09.771
we part ways.

41:09.815 --> 41:11.817
Copy that.

41:13.383 --> 41:17.083
But can I ask you why
you told him I figured it out?

41:18.650 --> 41:21.261
Well, Doug Lynch doesn't know me
from Adam,

41:21.304 --> 41:23.742
but if he thinks
you took care of it,

41:23.785 --> 41:27.267
maybe that's a memory that holds

41:27.310 --> 41:29.878
when everything else
has faded away.

41:32.968 --> 41:36.537
Besides, we get maximum value
out of a spent resource.

41:39.018 --> 41:40.976
Value of the resource?

41:41.020 --> 41:43.675
We don't do sentimental
in this building.

41:43.718 --> 41:46.199
Keep that in mind, moving on.

41:48.984 --> 41:51.552
Have a heart.
Make sure it's a hard heart.

41:51.596 --> 41:53.685
That's all, Lieutenant.
