MacGYVER:
I've been kind of busy

02:20.707 --> 02:23.710
intercepting some plans
for a guerrilla raid.

02:23.710 --> 02:26.212
Mother, look.

02:26.212 --> 02:29.215
Trouble is, it's nearly
made me miss my train.

02:29.215 --> 02:31.217
Look, he's thumbing a ride
from us.

02:31.217 --> 02:32.218
e.
Of cours

02:32.719 --> 02:33.720
Your generation hasn't
enough discipline

02:33.720 --> 02:35.722
to catch a train
on time.

02:35.722 --> 02:38.725
I didn't mean to start
a whole thing, Mother.

02:38.725 --> 02:40.226
And considering
who was after me...

02:40.226 --> 02:41.728
Hey, come on!

02:41.728 --> 02:43.229
...I'd just as soon not
miss my train.

02:43.229 --> 02:45.231
Come on, please!

02:45.231 --> 02:48.735
(laughter)

02:48.735 --> 02:50.737
I guess he missed
his connection.

02:50.737 --> 02:51.738
Yeah.

02:56.242 --> 02:58.244
Come on! Slow it down!

02:58.244 --> 03:00.246
Stop that train!

03:02.749 --> 03:04.751
Come on, I got a ticket.
I promise.

03:04.751 --> 03:06.252
No, no, go away.
Please!

03:06.252 --> 03:07.253
It is too dangerous.

03:07.253 --> 03:08.755
I can't.

03:08.755 --> 03:10.256
Slow down!

03:10.256 --> 03:13.259
Go away! Go!

03:14.761 --> 03:16.262
Are we going
to stop for him?

That's up to the enginee

03:19.766 --> 03:21.768
No, no!

03:21.768 --> 03:24.270
Please! Come on!
I need a ride!

03:24.270 --> 03:25.772
Oh, okay.

03:29.275 --> 03:31.778
You're a gentleman.
You're beautiful.

04:06.813 --> 04:09.816
Hi. Sorry about the holdup...

04:09.816 --> 04:11.317
so to speak.

Hey, you'r

Hi. Thanks

04:21.827 --> 04:22.829
You're lucky you made it.

04:22.829 --> 04:24.330
No more stops from here
to the coast.

04:24.330 --> 04:25.832
Take any empty seat.

04:25.832 --> 04:26.833
Well, thanks, but 
you could make my day

04:27.333 --> 04:28.835
.
if you told me I cou
ld get something to eat

04:28.835 --> 04:31.337
Right there in
the dining section.

04:31.337 --> 04:32.338
Terrific.

04:32.338 --> 04:33.840
Amazing how that works out.

04:33.840 --> 04:34.841
Excuse me.

05:04.871 --> 05:06.873
You got a pen?

05:06.873 --> 05:08.374
Yeah.

05:10.376 --> 05:11.377
Thanks.

I'll have a roast lamb
sandwich.

please.

How disgustingly healt

07:22.008 --> 07:24.010

Very nice to meet yo

07:27.513 --> 07:30.016
We shall be on thi
s misbegotten excuse

07:30.016 --> 07:33.019
for a railway thro
ugh a long dusty ride.

07:33.019 --> 07:35.521
And if we don't
at least drink together,

07:35.521 --> 07:37.523
why, we shall have
to drink separately.

07:37.523 --> 07:39.025
(brakes squealing)

07:39.025 --> 07:41.027
Ow!
Are you all right?

07:41.027 --> 07:42.028
Are you all right?

07:42.028 --> 07:44.530
It's so damned stupid of me!

07:45.031 --> 07:46.532
No, no, come on now.

07:46.532 --> 07:48.034
e.
It takes tim

07:48.034 --> 07:50.036
Very observant of you,
Mr. MacGyver,

07:50.036 --> 07:52.038
though it has been seven weeks.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.039
I'm so sorry. I...

07:53.039 --> 07:55.041
!
Don't cluck
over me, woman

07:55.041 --> 07:56.542
I'm a cripple.

07:56.542 --> 07:57.543
You're black.

07:58.044 --> 08:00.546
Neither is a conditi
on for sympathy.

08:08.054 --> 08:09.055
Sorry.

08:09.055 --> 08:10.556
It's okay.

08:10.556 --> 08:13.059
I noticed my color
a long time ago.

08:15.061 --> 08:17.563
He's just hurting.

08:18.064 --> 08:19.065
Andrea Collins.

08:19.565 --> 08:20.566
er.
MacGyv

08:20.566 --> 08:21.567
?
Mind if I join you

08:21.567 --> 08:23.069
I was hoping you'd ask.

08:46.092 --> 08:48.594
That was quite a stu
nt you pulled

08:48.594 --> 08:50.096
u,
after the way yo

08:50.096 --> 08:53.099
uh, broke the speed of light
trying to catch this train.

08:53.099 --> 08:54.100
What's the rush?

08:54.100 --> 08:55.601
Well, I'm a tourist.

08:56.102 --> 08:58.604
I didn't want to miss
the scenic ride.

08:59.105 --> 09:00.106
.
Uh-huh

09:00.106 --> 09:02.108
nt.
I work for
the State Departme

09:02.108 --> 09:03.109
Courier.

09:03.109 --> 09:04.110
Uh-huh.

09:04.110 --> 09:05.611
And I know urgent when I see it.

09:05.611 --> 09:08.114
All right, the truth.

09:09.615 --> 09:13.619
I just hijacked proof
of an illegal arms-oil deal,

09:13.619 --> 09:17.623
and if I get the proof out
of the country in time,

09:17.623 --> 09:20.626
I could help thwart
a little war.

09:20.626 --> 09:23.629
I was in a hurry.

09:23.629 --> 09:25.631
t.
Okay, I deserved tha

09:25.631 --> 09:31.637
We're just a couple of tourist
s enjoying the pretty scenery.

09:32.138 --> 09:36.142
From where I sit,
the scenery's very pretty.

09:36.642 --> 09:37.643
Why? Just tell me.

09:37.643 --> 09:39.145
ou.
Andy, I told y

09:39.145 --> 09:41.147
.
You know how I
feel about you

09:41.147 --> 09:44.650
Aw, come on, Laura,
it's more than just a feeling.

09:44.650 --> 09:46.652
Don't be afraid
to use the word.

09:46.652 --> 09:47.653
I'm not.

09:47.653 --> 09:49.655
Love.

09:50.156 --> 09:52.658
Like in I love you.

09:52.658 --> 09:54.160
Andy...

09:54.160 --> 09:55.661
Look, we'll be in Rajmir
in two days.

09:55.661 --> 09:57.163
Be home in one more.

09:57.163 --> 09:59.165
We could get married
a week later.

09:59.165 --> 10:01.667
Or as soon as our families
cool down.

10:01.667 --> 10:04.670
No. How long have
we known each other?

10:04.670 --> 10:06.172
It's not how long.

10:06.172 --> 10:07.173
It's how good.

10:07.673 --> 10:08.674
We met in Barcelona.

10:08.674 --> 10:10.176
Got along... okay.

10:10.176 --> 10:13.179
It was better than okay.

10:13.179 --> 10:16.682
Yeah, a lot better than okay.

10:16.682 --> 10:17.683
Good fun,

10:18.184 --> 10:20.186
good feelings.

10:20.186 --> 10:21.187
Good everything.

10:21.187 --> 10:22.688
All the pieces fit.

10:22.688 --> 10:24.690
Yeah, for a fun summer, sure.

10:24.690 --> 10:25.691
But marriage...

10:26.192 --> 10:27.693
ooh, marriage is different.

10:27.693 --> 10:29.695
I know.

10:29.695 --> 10:32.698
And it's what I want.

10:32.698 --> 10:33.699
I thought it would be
what you want.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.201
It is.

10:35.201 --> 10:37.203
That's why I want
to be damned sure.

10:37.203 --> 10:39.205
I lived through a divorce
when I was 12.

10:39.205 --> 10:41.707
I'm not going to go through
one of my own.

10:41.707 --> 10:43.709
What do I say?

10:44.210 --> 10:45.711
Trust me?

10:46.212 --> 10:48.714
Gamble on me?

10:48.714 --> 10:50.716
Love me.

10:50.716 --> 10:53.719
ay.
I guess that's
what we both s

11:35.261 --> 11:36.762
I owe you an apology.

11:36.762 --> 11:39.765
od.
That you d
o. Make it go

11:44.770 --> 11:47.273
You're forgiven.

11:47.273 --> 11:49.775
Oh, but... I must
make proper amends.

11:49.775 --> 11:51.277
Find a treasure,

11:51.277 --> 11:53.279
buy a drink,
slay a dragon...

11:53.279 --> 11:54.280
Oh!

11:54.280 --> 11:55.281
Oh, I'm so sorry.

11:55.281 --> 11:56.782
It's all right.
It, it's all right.

11:56.782 --> 11:59.285
The sight of beauty
invariably dizzies me.

11:59.785 --> 12:04.290
nt.
The stink of liquor does t
he same thing for me, Mr. Gra

12:04.290 --> 12:05.791
a.
Come along, Dian

12:05.791 --> 12:07.793
y.
I'm sorr

12:10.296 --> 12:12.798
If you're going to slay
a dragon,

12:12.798 --> 12:14.800
I know where you can find one.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.302
Here, here.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.812
(horn blowing)

12:29.315 --> 12:30.316
Everybody, keep in your seats!

12:30.316 --> 12:31.817
This train is now
in our control!

12:32.318 --> 12:33.819
Sit down!

12:33.819 --> 12:35.821
Keep down!

12:35.821 --> 12:37.823
You bloody st...
You can't...

12:37.823 --> 12:39.325
(gunshot)

12:39.325 --> 12:40.326
Oh, my...!

12:45.331 --> 12:46.832
Be quiet! Be careful!
Nobody will be hurt!

12:46.832 --> 12:48.334
You may have already
killed that man.

12:48.334 --> 12:49.835
GUNMAN:
It was an accident!

12:49.835 --> 12:50.836
I'm a doctor.

12:50.836 --> 12:53.839
And verifiably non-belligerent.

12:54.340 --> 12:55.341
Let me pass.

12:57.843 --> 12:59.345
I can use some help.

12:59.345 --> 13:00.346
I can help.

13:00.346 --> 13:01.847
Diana, don't be foolish.

13:01.847 --> 13:03.849
You have absolutel
y no experience.

13:03.849 --> 13:05.351
.
You'll only be a hindrance

13:10.356 --> 13:12.358
We are not bandits!

13:12.358 --> 13:15.361
Oh yeah?
What is it you want?

13:15.361 --> 13:17.863
Two men... who are
on this train.

13:17.863 --> 13:19.865
It is a matter of justice.

13:19.865 --> 13:20.866
.
I don't understand

13:21.367 --> 13:22.868
You don't have
to understand.

13:22.868 --> 13:25.371
We will find them.

13:27.373 --> 13:28.874
And when we have
found them,

13:28.874 --> 13:30.376
we will execute them.

13:45.391 --> 13:46.892
How is he?

13:48.894 --> 13:49.895
im?
With a bullet in h

13:49.895 --> 13:51.397
I've got him
stabilized.

13:51.397 --> 13:54.400
MacGYVER:
A man puts a gun to my head

13:54.400 --> 13:57.403
and says
he's not a terrorist...

13:57.903 --> 13:59.405
I take it with a grain of salt.

13:59.405 --> 14:02.408
GRANT:
He's got tissue trauma,
and he's losing blood.

14:02.408 --> 14:04.410
For now, he's
not getting any worse,

14:04.410 --> 14:06.412
but we can't afford
to take chances.

14:06.912 --> 14:08.414
There's
the inevitable shock...

14:09.915 --> 14:12.418
...
so, we'll have to get him
to a hospital straightaway

14:12.418 --> 14:13.919
e.
or he may di

14:13.919 --> 14:15.421
This is madness!

14:15.421 --> 14:17.423
We didn't want to...

14:17.923 --> 14:20.426
We will get help
once we stop.

14:20.426 --> 14:22.928
Are there others
in the sleeping car?

14:29.435 --> 14:32.438
y.
Whoops! Sorr

14:36.942 --> 14:37.943
(yelling)

14:37.943 --> 14:39.945
(yelling)

14:49.455 --> 14:53.459
One of the interesting things
about the local moonshine is

14:53.459 --> 14:54.960
it tastes a lot like kerosene,

14:54.960 --> 14:58.964
and it burns even better.

15:05.471 --> 15:06.472
(men yelling)

15:08.974 --> 15:09.975
There he is!

15:16.482 --> 15:18.484
(yelling)

15:35.000 --> 15:37.002
Hi.

15:37.002 --> 15:41.006
?
What in heaven's
name are you up to

15:41.006 --> 15:43.008
You're the fel
low we picked up.

15:43.509 --> 15:45.010
Yeah, right-- name's MacGyver.

15:45.010 --> 15:48.013
You also picked up a couple
of hijackers back there.

15:48.013 --> 15:50.015
That's what all the fuss
is about.

15:50.015 --> 15:52.518
t,
They are followi
ng the train on foo

15:52.518 --> 15:54.019
.
but they'll
never catch us

15:54.019 --> 15:55.521
Well done, MacGyver.

15:55.521 --> 15:56.522
Thanks.

15:56.522 --> 15:58.023
We shall report the incident

15:58.023 --> 15:59.525
when we get to Rajmir.

15:59.525 --> 16:00.526
All right.

16:18.043 --> 16:19.545
What's up ahead?

16:19.545 --> 16:20.546
ge.
A trestle brid

16:20.546 --> 16:23.048
ge,
And once we ar
e past that brid

16:23.048 --> 16:26.552
.
we are out of
the bandit country

16:26.552 --> 16:29.054

I think we c
an pick up spee

16:36.061 --> 16:38.564
Engineer seems to be
in a bit of a rush.

16:40.065 --> 16:43.569
(men speaking native language)

17:05.089 --> 17:08.093
I'd say we're bound
to see more trouble

17:08.093 --> 17:10.095
before we see Rajmir.

17:10.095 --> 17:11.597
They cannot stop
a moving train.

18:36.181 --> 18:37.182
(gunshot)

18:45.691 --> 18:47.192
(brakes squealing)

18:52.197 --> 18:53.699

18:57.202 --> 18:58.203

19:10.716 --> 19:14.720

19:14.720 --> 19:17.222

19:17.222 --> 19:18.724
MAN:
Hurry, quickly!

19:18.724 --> 19:20.726
Everyone to the train!
Quick! Go!

19:20.726 --> 19:22.227

19:43.248 --> 19:44.249
What are you doing?

19:44.249 --> 19:45.250

I'm going to rig i

u or I can start i

19:47.252 --> 19:48.253
Good.

19:48.253 --> 19:50.255
MacGYVER:
We got enough voltage here

19:50.756 --> 19:53.759
so if anyone fiddles with it,
it'll uncurl his beard.

20:00.766 --> 20:02.768
(gunshot)
Everybody off the train!

20:08.273 --> 20:09.274

Search the tra

20:09.274 --> 20:11.276

20:23.789 --> 20:25.290
Out now!

20:25.290 --> 20:27.292

20:27.793 --> 20:31.296
Out! Out! Out, I say!

20:31.296 --> 20:33.298
Oh, my Lord!

20:33.298 --> 20:34.299
Outside! All of you!

20:34.299 --> 20:35.801
No, please!

20:35.801 --> 20:37.302
Is he... dead?

20:37.803 --> 20:39.805
Dr. Grant and I can't leave.

Diana, this has
nothing to do with u

20:43.308 --> 20:45.310
GRANT:
I would have said
she's admirable.

20:46.311 --> 20:48.313
You said you were
an honorable man.

20:48.313 --> 20:51.316
Is it honorable
to let a wounded man die?

20:53.819 --> 20:54.820
The woman can stay.

20:54.820 --> 20:56.321
Everybody else, out.

21:01.326 --> 21:03.829
I'll be back
as soon as possible.

be frightened.

21:06.832 --> 21:08.333
I can't help it-- I am.

21:08.834 --> 21:09.835
I know.

21:09.835 --> 21:12.838
That's why you're admirable.

21:21.847 --> 21:23.849
We have all the passengers
off the train.

21:26.852 --> 21:31.356
This is my tra
in, my engine!

Easy there, ea

All of you.

My name is Hassan.

Will you c
ut to the poi

22:09.394 --> 22:11.396
In my good time!

22:13.398 --> 22:15.901
We are a poor people
in a hard country.

22:17.903 --> 22:19.905
ves
To make our li

22:19.905 --> 22:21.907
a little better,
to do something

22:21.907 --> 22:24.409
t,
worthwhile, we
set a place apar

22:24.409 --> 22:26.411
a clinic

22:26.411 --> 22:27.913
for the sick.

22:27.913 --> 22:29.414
For the children.

22:29.414 --> 22:33.418
All of us gave money,
whatever we could afford,

22:33.418 --> 22:36.421
and we bought medicines
and drugs in Chattur.

22:36.922 --> 22:39.424
From two Westerners.

22:39.424 --> 22:41.927
Two... businessmen.

22:41.927 --> 22:45.931
Americans
or English.

22:45.931 --> 22:48.433
They were paid
a great deal of money.

22:48.433 --> 22:50.435
But what has that to do with us?

22:50.435 --> 22:58.443
Only... that when our people
took your medicines, 26 died.

22:58.443 --> 23:00.445
One of those
who died was...

23:00.445 --> 23:02.447
my son.

23:02.447 --> 23:05.951
We were sold poisons!

23:05.951 --> 23:08.954
By two of you.

23:08.954 --> 23:10.956
For the money.

23:10.956 --> 23:12.457
Who?

23:12.457 --> 23:13.959
He doesn't know that.

23:13.959 --> 23:15.961
w.
Otherwise he'd b
e on them right no

23:15.961 --> 23:18.463
You have an eye for the truth

23:18.463 --> 23:21.466
behind the truth,
Mr. MacGyver.

23:22.968 --> 23:24.970
I don't know.

23:25.470 --> 23:29.975
So... you will tell me.

23:29.975 --> 23:31.476
That's ridiculous!

23:31.476 --> 23:32.978
We have no idea who the men are.

23:32.978 --> 23:34.479
Then find them!

23:34.479 --> 23:36.481
Among yourselves.

23:36.481 --> 23:38.483
You will give me
these murderers,

23:38.483 --> 23:42.487
and to help you in your efforts
to find them,

23:42.487 --> 23:46.491
there will be no food,
no water, until you do.

24:02.274 --> 24:05.277
They took all the food...
and the water.

24:06.778 --> 24:08.280
Kind of makes sense,
doesn't it?

24:08.280 --> 24:10.282
He's trying to put pressure
on us.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.286
Yeah, he's still checkin' out
the luggage.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.288
Doesn't seem to have found
anything yet.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.789
We're just going
to have to find
those men.

24:17.789 --> 24:19.291
Oh, right, and turn
them over to be killed.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.292
Is that it?

24:20.292 --> 24:23.795
Do we have
any volunteers?

24:25.797 --> 24:27.799
MacGYVER:
Well, the 
way I see it,

24:27.799 --> 24:29.801
we've got two things
to consider here.

24:29.801 --> 24:31.803
First of all,
can we identify the two men.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.805
And secondly, if w
e do find them,

24:34.306 --> 24:36.308
do we turn two people
over to be killed?

24:36.308 --> 24:38.810
ANDY:
Are you thirsty,
Laura?

24:38.810 --> 24:40.812
.
 LAURA:
Very. I gues
s everybody is

24:41.313 --> 24:43.815
I was thinking...

24:43.815 --> 24:45.817
if I could get
past the guards,

24:45.817 --> 24:47.319
maybe I could
steal a horse

24:47.319 --> 24:50.322
p.
or even follow the tra
cks until I found some hel

24:50.322 --> 24:52.824
e.
LAURA:
Andy, we're in t
he middle of nowher

24:52.824 --> 24:54.326
,
Anyway, with all
those guards out there

24:54.326 --> 24:56.828
.
it's too dangerous

24:57.829 --> 25:00.832
do?
What are we gonna

25:00.832 --> 25:03.335
I mean, this
is not my idea
of a fun experience.

25:03.835 --> 25:07.339
Maybe if we could get
word out to the police

25:07.339 --> 25:08.840
or to the embassy...

25:08.840 --> 25:10.842
I don't see how.

25:10.842 --> 25:12.344
d.
Oh, I'm so scare

25:12.344 --> 25:13.845
Hey, Laura,

25:13.845 --> 25:17.349
if Hassan was gonna do
anything violent,

25:17.349 --> 25:18.850
it would've happened by now.

25:18.850 --> 25:20.852
's
A-and as soo
n as the train

25:20.852 --> 25:22.354
.
reported missing..

25:22.354 --> 25:25.357
No... no, we're not gonna lie
to each other.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.858
It'll be a good week

25:26.858 --> 25:28.860
before anybody starts
to worry about us.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.862
So...

25:30.862 --> 25:33.865
all we have to count on is us.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.370
But that's all right.

25:38.370 --> 25:39.871
We'll make it.

25:44.376 --> 25:45.377
That wasn't much.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.879
ow.
Oh, I don't kn

25:47.879 --> 25:50.382
He made me
feel better.

25:59.391 --> 26:02.894
May I join you?

26:03.395 --> 26:04.396
I was hoping
you'd ask that.

26:04.896 --> 26:07.399
(chuckling)

26:13.405 --> 26:14.906
How come you'r
e not scared?

26:18.910 --> 26:21.413
Well, you know
that old saying,

26:21.413 --> 26:24.416
"Lord, give me the strength
to deal with what I can,

26:24.416 --> 26:27.419
and endure what I can't"?

26:28.420 --> 26:29.921
Well, I'm enduring.

26:30.922 --> 26:32.924
,
You know,
in a weird way

26:32.924 --> 26:35.927
you're a comfo
rt, MacGyver.

26:35.927 --> 26:36.928
Yeah?

26:37.429 --> 26:38.930
ah.
Ye

26:40.932 --> 26:42.934
I scored.

26:42.934 --> 26:43.935
Soda?

26:43.935 --> 26:46.938
They've cut the water off.

26:46.938 --> 26:47.939
At least it's liquid.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.442
A pathetic substitute
for anything else.

26:50.942 --> 26:51.943
(grunting)

26:53.945 --> 26:55.447
Here, let me.

26:56.948 --> 26:59.951
(fizzing)

26:59.951 --> 27:01.453
(grunts)

27:02.454 --> 27:04.956
(whistling)

27:04.956 --> 27:07.959
I was always strong.

27:07.959 --> 27:10.462
Why do you say strong
like it's some kind of drawback?

27:10.462 --> 27:13.465
Well, it is

27:13.465 --> 27:15.467
if you're oversized

27:15.467 --> 27:17.969
and agonizingly shy.

27:17.969 --> 27:21.473
I've no interest
in what you thought you are,

27:21.473 --> 27:24.476
only in what you are.

27:24.476 --> 27:25.477
A woman.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.479
A very exciting woman.

27:29.981 --> 27:31.983
Half a compliment
from half a man.

27:31.983 --> 27:33.985
No! No...

27:33.985 --> 27:36.488
I, uh... I'm...

27:36.488 --> 27:38.490
Correction, Iwasa surgeon.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.492
Before the accident.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.494
A damned good one.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.496
But now I'm...

27:44.496 --> 27:46.498
quite useless, you see.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.500
You're still a doctor.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.502
You knew what to do for him.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.003
You've kept him alive.

27:52.003 --> 27:53.505
I don't call that useless.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.006
(grimaces in pain)
What is it?

27:55.006 --> 27:57.509
Oh! Forgive me, it's...

28:00.011 --> 28:02.514
Sometimes the fingers
hurt like hell.

28:02.514 --> 28:03.515
The fingers?

28:03.515 --> 28:05.016
Mm.

28:05.016 --> 28:07.018
It's ghost pain.

28:07.519 --> 28:10.522
It's a phenomenon
of amputation.

28:12.524 --> 28:15.527
The body remembers
what's no longer there.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.529
.
Oh, my, I wish I
could do something

28:18.029 --> 28:19.030
Oh, you have.

28:19.030 --> 28:21.032
You've allowed me
to talk about it.

28:21.032 --> 28:23.034
I didn't think I could.

28:25.036 --> 28:30.041
Would it be awful
if I asked you... how?

28:30.041 --> 28:31.042
How?

28:31.042 --> 28:32.544
(laughs)

28:33.044 --> 28:34.045
It was really stupid.

28:34.045 --> 28:35.547
I was in London.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.048
I was stitching up
a stab wound

28:37.048 --> 28:39.050
in the emergency room
of a hospital, and

28:39.050 --> 28:41.052
suddenly,
the doors were kicked open,

28:41.052 --> 28:42.554
and this wild-eyed man
was there,

28:42.554 --> 28:46.057
wielding a-a sawn-off shotgun.

28:46.057 --> 28:47.559
A maniac?

28:47.559 --> 28:49.060
Drugged...
out of his mind.

28:49.060 --> 28:51.062
I remember thinking,
"If he fires that,

28:51.563 --> 28:53.064
"there's half a dozen people
in this room,

28:53.565 --> 28:55.066
any of them could be
killed or maimed."

28:55.567 --> 28:56.568
How dreadful.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.069
Well, I-I, you know,

28:58.069 --> 29:01.072
I think I've seen probably
too many Hollywood movies,

29:01.072 --> 29:03.074
but instead
of just staying there

29:03.575 --> 29:05.076
and staying absolutely still,

29:05.577 --> 29:07.078
I took a step towards him.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.581
And I extended my arm.

29:10.081 --> 29:14.085
And then I said something
absolutely stupid like...

29:15.587 --> 29:18.590
I think you better
hand me that gun.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.091
And he shot you?

29:20.091 --> 29:24.095
Yes. I was so close to him

29:24.095 --> 29:26.097
that the blast from the gun
just...

29:26.598 --> 29:29.100
disintegrated my arm.

29:29.100 --> 29:32.103
Fortunately,
no one else was-was hurt.

29:32.103 --> 29:37.108
By such mad improbabilities
are dreams destroyed.

29:40.111 --> 29:41.613
y.
I'm sorr

29:42.113 --> 29:43.615
Well, that's my story.

29:44.115 --> 29:45.617
Now, what's yours?

29:46.117 --> 29:48.119
What do you want
out of life?

29:53.124 --> 29:55.126
ul.
To be purposef

29:55.126 --> 29:57.128
ul.
To be usef

29:58.630 --> 30:00.632
ed.
To be need

30:00.632 --> 30:02.634
Oh, Lord!

30:04.135 --> 30:06.137
You are.

30:06.137 --> 30:08.139
You are needed.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.148
What's that?

30:17.148 --> 30:20.151
It's a bottle spout
I've made into a whistle.

30:20.151 --> 30:21.653
e?
COLLINS:
A dog whistl

30:21.653 --> 30:23.154
Yeah, sort of.

30:23.154 --> 30:26.157
It's pitched above human range,
but animals can hear it.

30:26.157 --> 30:28.159
And if I've done it right,

30:28.159 --> 30:31.162
they're gonna be none too happy
with the sound.

30:32.163 --> 30:33.665
(faint, high-pitched tone)

30:34.165 --> 30:35.166
(horse whinnying)

30:35.166 --> 30:37.168
HASSAN:
Whoa. Whoa, boy, down!

30:37.168 --> 30:38.670
y.
Down, bo

30:38.670 --> 30:41.172
(neighing)
Easy. Easy.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.677
(crickets chirping,
horse sputtering)

30:50.181 --> 30:52.684
e.
He is usua
lly very docil

30:52.684 --> 30:55.186
Guard duty
tonight, Hassan?

30:55.186 --> 30:58.189
It is necessary.

30:58.189 --> 31:00.692
How is he, the man
who was wounded?

31:00.692 --> 31:02.193
He might die.

31:02.193 --> 31:03.695
We did not want that.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.697
Come on, Hassan.

31:05.697 --> 31:08.700
You hijacked a train by force.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.702
To make a just end.

31:11.202 --> 31:13.705
To take payment for murder.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.707
My son died.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.709
Badur's brother.

31:17.709 --> 31:20.211
Laila from t
he next village

31:20.211 --> 31:22.213
lost her thr
ee children,

31:22.213 --> 31:25.216
the youngest,
not yet able to walk.

31:25.216 --> 31:26.217
She was not
much younger

31:26.217 --> 31:28.219
than the little
child with the doll.

31:28.219 --> 31:30.221
It is a terrible thing

31:30.221 --> 31:32.724
to see a child die.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.726
I'm sorry.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.728
Please believe me.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.730
We're all sorry.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.732
s,
HASSAN:
We worke
d together
, all of u

31:41.232 --> 31:43.234
en
to build a cli
nic for the childr

31:43.735 --> 31:45.236
and for my son.

31:48.239 --> 31:50.241
Pride is a sin.

31:50.241 --> 31:52.744
And God struck me for my pride

31:52.744 --> 31:54.245
n.
in my so

31:54.245 --> 31:56.247
Your son gave the medicine?

31:56.247 --> 31:58.249
e.
HASSAN:
With a needl

31:58.750 --> 32:00.251
lf,
First to himse

32:00.251 --> 32:02.754
so the children
would not be frightened.

32:04.756 --> 32:07.759
So, they were brave.

32:07.759 --> 32:10.762
And I was proud.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.764
And they died.

32:14.265 --> 32:17.769
So, you're going
to avenge death by killing.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.771
I will do what I must.

32:19.771 --> 32:22.273
You're still proud, Hassan.

32:22.273 --> 32:24.776
But taking more lives
won't bring your son back.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.778
Find me the men, MacGyver.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.280
And then go.

32:34.285 --> 32:36.287
I feel for that man.

32:38.289 --> 32:40.291
He has a right.

32:40.291 --> 32:42.293
But he's wrong.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.797
(birds singing)

32:53.304 --> 32:55.306
Another day.

32:58.309 --> 33:02.313
A whole nother set
of fresh possibilities.

33:04.315 --> 33:06.818
I'm a sucker for mornings.

33:56.367 --> 33:58.369
(men talking
in the background)

33:58.369 --> 33:59.370
(grunts)

34:01.372 --> 34:03.875
(men talking
increases in volume)

34:28.399 --> 34:30.902
(grunting)

34:55.426 --> 34:57.428
(panting)

34:57.428 --> 34:58.930
Hey, where are you going?

34:59.430 --> 35:01.933
Hey! Stop! Stop, I say!

35:01.933 --> 35:02.934
Stop!
(grunts)

35:02.934 --> 35:04.435
(gunshots)
I will have your head!

35:04.435 --> 35:06.938
Andy! Oh!

35:06.938 --> 35:07.939
(gunshots)

35:07.939 --> 35:09.941
(grunting)

35:09.941 --> 35:11.943
(neighing)
HASSAN:
Whoa, whoa!

35:11.943 --> 35:12.944
Whoa!

35:12.944 --> 35:14.946
I got him, I got him!

35:14.946 --> 35:15.947
HASSAN:
Whoa!

35:15.947 --> 35:16.948
I've got the kid, Hassan!

35:16.948 --> 35:19.450
It's all right!
Don't shoot!

35:21.452 --> 35:24.956
If you don't mind my saying so,
that was real dumb.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.958
dy!
An

35:26.958 --> 35:28.459
Sorry, babe, I tried.

35:28.459 --> 35:30.461
Oh, because I
was so scared.

35:30.962 --> 35:31.963
Oh, Andy...

35:32.964 --> 35:34.465
I thought I was gonna make it.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.968
Until friend Kramer here
blew the whistle on you.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.469
Why?

35:38.970 --> 35:39.971
y.
I'm sorr

35:39.971 --> 35:40.972
I was, um...

35:41.472 --> 35:42.974
Uh, you startled
me, uh, besi...

35:42.974 --> 35:44.475
That's funny.

35:44.475 --> 35:46.477
I got the idea you wanted
to see the kid get nailed.

35:46.978 --> 35:47.979
Take the heat off
everybody else.

35:47.979 --> 35:49.480
Especially you.

35:51.482 --> 35:52.483
KRAMER:
That's not true!

35:52.483 --> 35:53.985
Search him.

35:55.486 --> 35:56.988
ad.
Oh, go ahe

35:57.488 --> 35:58.489
de.
I've nothing to hi

35:58.489 --> 35:59.490
Maybe you wouldn't mind

35:59.991 --> 36:01.492
if we took a look
in your compartment.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.502
(bed squeaks)

36:37.028 --> 36:39.530
It is mine.

36:40.031 --> 36:43.034
.
I-I was simply afraid that
you'd steal it, that's all

36:43.034 --> 36:45.536
ne.
I never sold
poison to anyo

36:45.536 --> 36:49.040
Paper.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.541
We paid in gold.

36:54.545 --> 36:56.547
He is no doubt a thief...

36:56.547 --> 36:59.050
and a liar.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.552
But he is not the man
I am looking for.

37:02.553 --> 37:05.056
You know, Hassan,

37:05.056 --> 37:07.058
you just gave me an idea.

37:14.565 --> 37:17.568
MacGYVER:
One of the best ways
to get inside a man's mind

37:17.568 --> 37:19.070
is to go through his body.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.571
GRANT:
With my sphygmomanometer?

37:22.573 --> 37:25.076
MacGYVER:
Well, a human being
can try to lie,

37:25.076 --> 37:27.078
but the funny thing is,

37:27.078 --> 37:32.083
the body always has a way
of telling the truth.

37:32.083 --> 37:35.086
All I have to do is cannibalize
your medical kit...

37:37.088 --> 37:41.092
...borrow an alarm clock
and build us a translator.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.109
GRANT:
MacGyver.

37:58.109 --> 38:01.112
You have a remarkable flair
for junk art.

38:03.614 --> 38:05.616
A lie detector's
a simple thing, actually.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.119
When you lie,
your blood pressure goes up

38:08.119 --> 38:09.620
and you sweat.

38:10.121 --> 38:12.623
Sweat creates a conductance,
and, uh,

38:12.623 --> 38:14.625
it'll sound the alarm,

38:14.625 --> 38:16.127
(buzzing)
like this.

38:16.127 --> 38:18.629
Hmm...

38:20.631 --> 38:22.633
Your son would have understood.

38:25.636 --> 38:27.638
You are right.

38:27.638 --> 38:29.140
Show me.

38:30.141 --> 38:32.143
Okay.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.644
I'm gonna ask you
a question.

38:33.644 --> 38:37.148
I want you to lie,
all right?

38:37.148 --> 38:40.651
Andy... did you
try to escape?

38:40.651 --> 38:42.653
No, I didn't.

38:42.653 --> 38:44.655
(buzzing)

38:47.658 --> 38:49.160
Do you deal drugs?

38:49.160 --> 38:50.161
No.

38:52.663 --> 38:55.166
Andy, did you sell these people
bad medicine?

38:55.166 --> 38:56.667
No, I didn't, damn it!

38:56.667 --> 38:58.669
No way!

38:58.669 --> 39:01.172
Why did you run away?

39:01.172 --> 39:04.175
For Laura.

39:04.175 --> 39:07.178
Because she was
so scared.

39:07.178 --> 39:10.181
I learned
I'm not much of a hero.

39:11.182 --> 39:14.185
Oh, I learned
something, too.

39:14.685 --> 39:16.187
When I thought you
might be killed,

39:16.687 --> 39:19.690
I... I just fell apart.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.694
I don't need a hero.

39:24.195 --> 39:26.197
.
I need you

39:28.699 --> 39:29.700
(buzzing)

39:29.700 --> 39:33.704
Um, that was love, not lying.

39:33.704 --> 39:36.207
I almost believe.

39:38.209 --> 39:40.211
Ask the others.

39:40.211 --> 39:41.712
And then...

39:42.213 --> 39:45.216
I will ask you, MacGyver.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.718
No, I don't think so, Hassan.

39:47.718 --> 39:50.221
I'm not gonna put anybody else
through this

39:50.221 --> 39:52.223
until I know what
you're gonna do

39:52.223 --> 39:53.724
with the men
once you find them.

39:53.724 --> 39:56.227
Justice!

39:56.227 --> 39:59.230
They will take the medicines
they sold to us.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.731
You'll kill them.

40:01.732 --> 40:04.735
No. They will kill
themselves.

40:05.236 --> 40:06.737
Justice.

40:06.737 --> 40:09.740
Nope. That's murder.

40:09.740 --> 40:12.743
What do you want?

40:12.743 --> 40:15.746
If we find the men,

40:15.746 --> 40:18.749
I want you to come
to Rajmir with us

40:18.749 --> 40:20.751
where they'll stand trial.

40:31.762 --> 40:34.265
I agree.

40:34.765 --> 40:36.267
On memory of my son.

40:36.767 --> 40:38.269
It's a deal.

40:38.269 --> 40:40.271
?
You're gonna t
ake his word for i
t, just like that

40:42.273 --> 40:44.275
Yup, I guess I am.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.779
You know, Mr. Webster, I think
you just volunteered to go next.

40:48.779 --> 40:49.780
What do you say?

40:50.281 --> 40:51.282
Have a seat.

40:51.282 --> 40:54.785
Sure. I'll go next.

40:58.789 --> 40:59.790
If you think I'm
guilty of this,

41:00.291 --> 41:01.292
zy.
you're all cra

41:04.795 --> 41:05.796
(chuckling)

41:17.308 --> 41:18.809
All right, you about ready?

41:25.816 --> 41:29.820
Mr. Webster... did you sell
fake toxic medicines

41:29.820 --> 41:32.323
to Hassan's people?

41:39.330 --> 41:40.831
(alarm buzzing)

41:40.831 --> 41:42.333
Blade?!

41:42.333 --> 41:44.335
Damn it, Paul,
you said you could handle it!

41:44.835 --> 41:46.337
I can!
Give me my damn gun!

41:46.337 --> 41:48.839
We're out of here, anyway.

41:48.839 --> 41:50.841
(gunshot)

42:30.381 --> 42:35.386
(groaning)

42:35.886 --> 42:36.887
Don't be a fool, MacGyver.

42:36.887 --> 42:38.389
We can all get out of here.

42:38.389 --> 42:40.391
We'll just back the train
right up through them.

42:40.391 --> 42:42.893
I can't do that.

42:42.893 --> 42:45.896
I gave Hassan my word.

42:45.896 --> 42:48.899
Tough.

42:49.400 --> 42:52.903
Webster, don't do it.

42:54.405 --> 42:56.907
I rigged the circuits
to overload.

42:56.907 --> 42:58.409
They'll blow on you.

42:58.409 --> 43:01.412
You ought to take your own
lie detector test, MacGyver.

43:02.913 --> 43:04.415
Don't do it!

43:05.416 --> 43:06.917
Ah!

43:11.922 --> 43:13.924
Justice.

43:15.926 --> 43:18.929
Make sure you change the bandage
after three days.

43:18.929 --> 43:20.931
There's no sign
of an infection.

43:20.931 --> 43:21.932
r.
Thank you, Docto

43:22.433 --> 43:24.935
Good.

43:24.935 --> 43:28.939
All right,
give Hassan his gold back.

43:28.939 --> 43:30.441
Ah!

43:32.943 --> 43:34.945
Yes.

43:36.447 --> 43:39.950
Would you take this gold
and buy medicines for us?

43:39.950 --> 43:40.951
Good medicines?

43:40.951 --> 43:43.954
..
But that's like.

43:43.954 --> 43:47.458
ic.
Hassan, medicines
aren't like bloody mag

43:47.458 --> 43:48.959
r.
You... you
need a docto

43:49.460 --> 43:50.961
I think he's already got
that figured out.

43:52.463 --> 43:53.964
He's looking at a doctor.

43:54.465 --> 43:55.466
Uh-uh, I can't.

43:55.466 --> 43:57.468
re.
I don't practi
ce medicine anymo

43:57.468 --> 43:59.970
We would be honored.

43:59.970 --> 44:01.472
(stifled chuckle)

44:01.472 --> 44:02.973
!
It's crazy

44:02.973 --> 44:04.975
...
I couldn't possibly
take on something like

44:05.476 --> 44:06.977
single-hande
d, so to speak.

44:06.977 --> 44:08.479
You wouldn't have to.

44:08.479 --> 44:11.982
Diana, have you gone
absolutely out of your mind?

44:11.982 --> 44:14.485
My question exactly.

44:14.985 --> 44:17.988
(sighing):
The answer is yes.

44:17.988 --> 44:20.491
What are you
planning on doing?

44:20.491 --> 44:21.992
I don't know...

44:21.992 --> 44:23.494
but for the first time
in my life,

44:23.994 --> 44:25.996
I'm finding out
what kind of person I am.

44:27.998 --> 44:31.502
Well, all I can say
is it's about time.

44:37.508 --> 44:39.510
I think you're all
a bit mad.

44:39.510 --> 44:41.512
But if there's
anything you need

44:41.512 --> 44:44.014
for this so-called clinic
of yours,

44:44.014 --> 44:46.517
Diana knows
where to reach me.

44:46.517 --> 44:48.018
Thank you, Mother.

44:48.018 --> 44:50.521
Have a good trip home.

44:55.526 --> 44:59.029
Primitive working conditions,
lousy hours,

44:59.029 --> 45:01.031
.
monster workload..

45:01.031 --> 45:04.034
no pay...

45:04.034 --> 45:06.036
