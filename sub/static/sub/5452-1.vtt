they're given some kind of

of when you got married.

When you were good-looking,
and you smiled at each other.

11:58.926 --> 12:02.053
Hell, when you even
just looked at each other.

12:02.930 --> 12:05.598
So what happened
between then and now?

12:07.893 --> 12:08.977
Me.

12:11.355 --> 12:14.190
I... I came along,

12:14.275 --> 12:19.487
and I made you tired
and cranky and anxious

12:21.157 --> 12:25.994
and I made you lose
your hair and gain
20 extra pounds and...

12:27.663 --> 12:32.625
Somewhere in all of that,
I... You stopped loving
each other.

for a handout.

because you're not spotting.
Now, spot!

Yeah, not hard enough.

Kevin, you're a mess. Look.

17:22.958 --> 17:25.710
She does passé fifth

a real good plié,

17:25.794 --> 17:28.880
so you both have
a good preparation
for the pas de chat.

17:28.964 --> 17:33.259

you've got to use your
stomach and your back.

17:33.427 --> 17:36.053

You have to support her.

be a professional ballet

18:05.250 --> 18:15.092
Lovely.

18:15.886 --> 18:17.512
Beautiful, Alice.

18:19.806 --> 18:21.307
All right. I don't want
you to think about it.

19:10.065 --> 19:11.941
Jenny, is that loose?

19:12.734 --> 19:16.404
You gotta learn
not to be embarrassed
and you better do it now.

sending me out,

to see me for this pilot.

You didn't like
the shaking?

as fun. It was more of
a hassle.

It doesn't really
have anything
to do with acting.

you guys to the agents
if you want. You know?

Yep.

it performs.

play for one of the musicals.

may be entertaining,

39:25.404 --> 39:28.156

May I suggest that
the only thing of value you
could possibly bring to Bach

39:31.035 --> 39:32.744
is your respect.

And unless you devote
yourself to study,

of technique,

01:02:31.872 --> 01:02:33.415
like, straight out
of a Wes Anderson.

01:02:33.499 --> 01:02:36.793
It's The Life Aquatic meets
The Bad and the Beautiful.

01:02:37.295 --> 01:02:39.296
Sounds really
artistic, Neil.

01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:41.006
Well, I think so.

01:02:41.632 --> 01:02:43.717
Hopefully,
Sundance agrees.

01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:05.488
Small place.
Yeah.

01:03:05.573 --> 01:03:07.115
You want some coffee
or some water?

01:03:07.199 --> 01:03:09.242
I'm all right.
You don't want to
see me on coffee.

01:03:09.327 --> 01:03:10.410
Wired enough as is.

01:03:10.494 --> 01:03:11.870
Take a seat.

01:03:12.038 --> 01:03:14.080
The script is good.

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:16.374
Thank you.

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:20.670
It's, you know, a labor
of love of mine and
it's not quite there yet.

01:03:20.755 --> 01:03:23.131
I would be honored
to take it on.

01:03:23.215 --> 01:03:28.303
We don't often do shorts,
but, in your case,
we'll make an exception.

01:03:28.763 --> 01:03:31.139
Eddie, that's...
That's amazing!

01:03:31.223 --> 01:03:32.265
(BOTH LAUGH)

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:34.267
Now... Now,
let's talk about
the budget.

01:03:34.352 --> 01:03:36.895
Yeah, let's talk about it.
Let's talk about the budget.

01:03:36.979 --> 01:03:39.481
How are you gonna
raise the money?

01:03:41.942 --> 01:03:45.070
N EIL: This is a
once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity here.

01:03:45.154 --> 01:03:47.989
I don't understand.
Shouldn't he be
giving you the money?

01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:49.449
Isn't that what
producers do?

01:03:49.533 --> 01:03:53.119
He's not the financier.
He's the producer.
And there's a difference.

01:03:53.204 --> 01:03:55.205
All I need you to do
is kick in, like,
five grand.

01:03:55.289 --> 01:03:56.331
And I know. I'm aware.

01:03:56.415 --> 01:03:58.708
I'm aware
that's a lot of money.
I really get it. I get it.

01:03:58.793 --> 01:04:01.795
But, you know, Eddie says
we could even, you know...

01:04:01.879 --> 01:04:04.631
We could sell it to
television and make
a profit.

01:04:04.715 --> 01:04:06.132
You gotta trust me
on this one, Dad.

01:04:06.217 --> 01:04:08.677
I'd be shooting
on a real film
and everything.

01:04:08.761 --> 01:04:12.180
I mean, Dad...
I mean, this is
the real deal, Dad.

01:04:12.932 --> 01:04:15.058
The real deal, huh?
You think so?

01:04:19.271 --> 01:04:20.772
Come on, Dad.

01:04:21.065 --> 01:04:22.899
Help a brother out.

(PEOPLE LAUGH ING)

01:04:27.613 --> 01:04:30.782
So this is what it's like
to have a social life?

01:04:31.158 --> 01:04:32.867
Yeah, well, it beats
memorizing Shakespeare,
doesn't it?

01:04:32.952 --> 01:04:34.077
Yeah.

01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:37.664

have to stay here?

01:04:37.748 --> 01:04:39.708

let's just have fun.

We haven't been
out in a while.

01:04:41.293 --> 01:04:42.419
Okay.

01:04:43.421 --> 01:04:45.755
I'll get us
some drinks.
Okay.

01:05:00.688 --> 01:05:02.480
Well, look who it is.

Hey! Um...

01:05:05.443 --> 01:05:07.694
Jenny.
Jenny. That's right.
Of course.

01:05:07.778 --> 01:05:09.154
I remember you
from last year.

01:05:09.238 --> 01:05:11.906
You did the show with
the monologue from...

01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:13.074
From Proof, right?

01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:14.117
Yeah!

01:05:14.201 --> 01:05:16.745
Yeah, you were
really good.

01:05:17.663 --> 01:05:19.748
Thank you.
You're welcome.

01:05:19.957 --> 01:05:22.459
So how is P.A.?
I kind of miss it.

01:05:22.835 --> 01:05:24.836
It's the same-old,
same-old.

01:05:25.004 --> 01:05:27.422
But I've been
watching you
on your show.

01:05:27.506 --> 01:05:28.673
Oh, really?
Yeah.

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:31.760
Well, thanks.
Yeah, it's going
pretty well.

01:05:31.844 --> 01:05:33.928
I got a big storyline
right now, so...

01:05:34.013 --> 01:05:35.847

It's kind of blowing up.

01:05:35.931 --> 01:05:37.766
We're slamming
shots, bro.
Yeah. Shots.

01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:40.560
Give me one second.
I'm talking to Jenny.
Um...

01:05:40.644 --> 01:05:41.811
You want to take shots?

01:05:41.896 --> 01:05:42.937
I'm good, thanks.

01:05:43.022 --> 01:05:45.106
Are you sure? Okay.
Yeah.

01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:49.736
You know, they're looking
for day players on the show.

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:52.071
Would that be something
you might be interested in?

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:55.492
Seriously?
Yeah. I mean,
I could put in a good word.

01:05:55.576 --> 01:05:59.704
(STAMMERING) Yeah!
That would be perfect.
Thank you.

01:05:59.914 --> 01:06:02.624
Okay. So how should
we do this? Do you want
to give me your number?

01:06:02.708 --> 01:06:04.459
Yeah, I don't think
I have a pen or a...

01:06:04.543 --> 01:06:07.629
No, no, don't worry about it.
Just put it right in here.

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:16.221
Yeah, I can do this.
Yeah, I don't... Yeah, okay.

it's so good to see you.
You look great.

J EN NY: All we were doing
was talking, okay?

01:06:41.747 --> 01:06:43.498
He saw my monologue
from P.A.

01:06:43.582 --> 01:06:46.292
That's all we
were talking about.
He wants to help me.

01:06:46.377 --> 01:06:48.586
God, could you possibly
be that naive?

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:50.088
He's trying to hook up
with you, Jenny.

01:06:50.172 --> 01:06:52.006
That's ridiculous.
He's a big-time actor.

01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:53.883
He can hook up
with whoever he wants.

01:06:53.968 --> 01:06:56.553
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, he loves your talent.
That's what he loves.

01:06:56.637 --> 01:07:01.140
So it's that preposterous that
somebody might actually
like me for my talent?

01:07:02.476 --> 01:07:04.060
No, of course not.

01:07:04.144 --> 01:07:07.772
Look, no one believes
in you more than I do,
and you know that.

01:07:07.898 --> 01:07:10.984
Honestly, it's just
the way he was
looking at you.

01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:13.152
Fine.

01:07:13.779 --> 01:07:18.199
If it means that much to
you, I won't talk to him
ever again. Promise.

Now let's get
out of here.

01:07:23.038 --> 01:07:24.706

dad's apartment.

What, now?
Mmm-hmm.

until later.

is play it for the team,

see what kind of
feedback we get,

back to you.

Yo, yo, did you see him
bobbing his head?

01:08:10.377 --> 01:08:12.837
He was bobbing
his head to himself.
He was bobbing...

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:15.506
Guys, guys.
He didn't say
he wanted us.

01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:18.426
Did you not hear
what he said?
He said, "Interesting."

01:08:18.510 --> 01:08:19.928
Interesting!
Man, we are so in.

even trying, Rosie.

Ballet is a requirement
for every student dancer
in this school.

But, Ms. Kraft,
I'm good at hip-hop!

01:08:37.738 --> 01:08:42.867
My job isn't to cast
music videos. It's to
train serious dancers.

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:46.287
P.A. isn't about just
doing whatever you want.

01:08:46.372 --> 01:08:49.247

where you fit in here.

What's that
supposed to mean?

01:08:55.214 --> 01:08:57.881

flailing around and you're
not gonna...

girls who don't have the...

Oh, really? Then how come
this department is filled
with skinny little girls

little butts, walking around
drinking Diet Coke?

01:09:12.939 --> 01:09:15.649
I ain't never gonna be
like them. And I don't
wanna be.

01:09:15.734 --> 01:09:17.777

a period to dance parts
for real women.

And that sucks!

01:09:24.785 --> 01:09:28.496
You're part of a machinery
of oppression, Ms. Kraft.
Just admit it.

01:09:29.081 --> 01:09:33.126
Hey! First of all,
don't speak to me
like that.

01:09:33.210 --> 01:09:36.254
Don't speak to any
teacher like that.
It's very rude.

01:09:36.337 --> 01:09:37.714
It's also very ugly.

01:09:38.381 --> 01:09:40.341
And second of all,
you know that's not true.

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:42.176
I want my dancers
to be healthy,

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:45.263

all about that
all the time.

You don't have
a good technique,

01:09:47.975 --> 01:09:50.977

toward a technique.

01:10:05.409 --> 01:10:06.534
You're kidding!

01:10:06.618 --> 01:10:09.537

find you to tell you that
it's the best show ever,

and I'm only
semi-regular at first,

01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:12.707
but then they said
I could get a lead,

01:10:12.791 --> 01:10:14.834
and it's so amazing
you won't believe it.

01:10:14.918 --> 01:10:16.961
Yay! Okay.
So what show is it?

01:10:17.421 --> 01:10:18.421
Sesame Street.

01:10:18.505 --> 01:10:20.006

You bitch.

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:27.680
I wonder if they need
any hot, young, new,
macho director types.

01:10:27.765 --> 01:10:30.725
I mean, I know they're
always looking for
new talent on that show.

01:10:30.809 --> 01:10:32.101
I don't think so.

01:10:32.186 --> 01:10:34.979
But if you're really nice
and give me back rubs,

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:36.898
I might let you be
part of my entourage.

01:10:36.982 --> 01:10:39.067
Ooh, back rubs.
You mean like...

you'll be really bad.

It's gonna be great.

01:11:10.516 --> 01:11:14.393

01:21:57.078 --> 01:21:58.620
Right, of course.

01:21:58.705 --> 01:22:00.873
You gotta be ready
for whatever they
throw at you.

01:22:00.957 --> 01:22:02.416
I mean, our job,
as actors,

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:04.710
is to make
the audience believe
what's really going on.

01:22:04.794 --> 01:22:06.753
Right.
I remember
learning that at P.A.

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:09.465
Am I wrong?
No, not at all.
That's exactly... Yeah.

01:22:09.549 --> 01:22:11.758
No, that's it. Perfect.
Okay.

01:22:12.469 --> 01:22:13.510
Let's try it again?

01:22:13.595 --> 01:22:15.095
Yep. Let's do it.

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:16.680
Okay.

01:22:18.475 --> 01:22:19.850
And action.

01:22:19.976 --> 01:22:22.561
The music was so loud,
I had to get out of there.

01:22:22.645 --> 01:22:25.564
Maddy, I'm so glad
you brought me with you.

01:22:26.274 --> 01:22:28.901
I mean, you know
how I feel about you.

01:22:29.986 --> 01:22:32.112
Or at least
I hope you do.

01:22:43.666 --> 01:22:45.501
Andy.
Jesus, Jenny.

01:22:46.211 --> 01:22:48.670
Look, I don't understand it.
You're not getting it.

01:22:48.755 --> 01:22:52.466
I mean, do you know how
many girls would die for
this opportunity with me?

01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:56.345
Yeah. And I'm sure
you've had every one
of them in this trailer.

01:22:56.429 --> 01:22:58.305
No, probably not
every one of them.

01:22:58.389 --> 01:23:02.351
Look, is this even
an audition or do you have
a collection of these tapes?

01:23:03.478 --> 01:23:05.187
I might have a few.

01:23:05.813 --> 01:23:08.148
Look, Jenny.
No. You came here.

01:23:08.733 --> 01:23:10.275
Okay, what did you think
was gonna happen?

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:13.320
We were gonna talk
about our craft?

01:23:13.404 --> 01:23:14.947
I don't do that.

01:23:15.031 --> 01:23:17.366
Okay, you don't,
but I do.
Right.

01:23:17.492 --> 01:23:18.700
No, look.
Stop it, okay!

01:23:18.743 --> 01:23:20.118
Can you just
leave me alone?
Jenny.

01:23:20.203 --> 01:23:21.995
Just leave me alone!

01:23:32.215 --> 01:23:35.050
Wait. Andy?
What about Andy?

01:23:37.095 --> 01:23:40.347
Andy invited me to set
to meet a casting director.

01:23:42.725 --> 01:23:45.561
And we went into
his trailer. And...

01:23:45.770 --> 01:23:47.563
Well, I...
Jenny.

01:23:48.356 --> 01:23:50.774
Well, did he try
something on you?

01:23:51.276 --> 01:23:52.818
Kind of.

01:23:52.902 --> 01:23:55.279
I knew it! I knew
this was gonna happen.

01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:56.655
Marco!
I told you

01:23:56.739 --> 01:23:58.365
about this asshole
from the beginning.

01:23:58.449 --> 01:23:59.950
But you still went
behind my back.

01:24:00.034 --> 01:24:02.244
I know. And I'm sorry,
but I...

01:24:02.328 --> 01:24:05.497
Look, I thought that maybe
if he did want to flirt,
just a little bit,

01:24:05.582 --> 01:24:07.082
that it would be
fine if I...

01:24:07.166 --> 01:24:09.293
What, if you got the job?

01:24:09.377 --> 01:24:10.502
You know what, Jenny?

01:24:10.587 --> 01:24:13.630
If becoming famous
is so important to you,

01:24:13.715 --> 01:24:16.216
then go for it.
I'm done with this.

01:24:17.176 --> 01:24:19.136
Marco, I...
Hey, you know what?

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:22.306
I hope you really get
the role. I really do.

01:24:25.768 --> 01:24:28.228
N EIL: What do you mean,
I can't have my camera
equipment?

01:24:28.313 --> 01:24:30.647
You see, I already gave
the check to my producer.

01:24:30.732 --> 01:24:32.232
So, this is
a matter of...
Sir, there's no...

01:24:32.358 --> 01:24:33.734
You are not registered
on the computer.
Right.

01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:35.319
Neither you nor your
producer are here.
Okay.

01:24:35.403 --> 01:24:36.403
I cannot do that.

01:24:36.487 --> 01:24:38.363
At the same time,
this film is
fully funded.

01:24:38.489 --> 01:24:40.532
I don't care.
It may be.
He just called me.

01:24:40.617 --> 01:24:43.035
He goes, "Earl's gonna
help you out." You're not
helping me out, Earl.

01:24:43.119 --> 01:24:45.495
I would love to help you out,
but there's nothing I can do.
I cannot...

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:46.955
You know what,
let's check
the name again.

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:49.082
I've checked the name
already three times...

01:24:49.167 --> 01:24:51.710
Please just check
the name again. Let's
do it again. Come on.

01:24:51.794 --> 01:24:54.630
B-A-C-Z-Y-N-S-K-Y.
I know how to spell it.

01:24:54.714 --> 01:24:56.048
I tried it three times.
Earl, please help me here.

01:24:56.132 --> 01:24:59.217
I would love to help you,
but it's not there.
There's nothing I can do.

(BLACK AND GOLD PLAYING)

01:25:46.974 --> 01:25:50.018
You remember how you
asked me to write you that
letter of recommendation?

01:25:50.103 --> 01:25:51.186
Of course.

01:25:52.021 --> 01:25:53.313
Well...

01:25:54.023 --> 01:25:57.401
I'm sorry, but I can't
write you that letter.

01:26:02.323 --> 01:26:06.660
Sometimes we get students
who are promising,

01:26:07.704 --> 01:26:11.707
but they never progress
past that early promise.

(SINGING) If the fish
swam out of the ocean

01:26:30.977 --> 01:26:33.228
I know you want to
be a ballet dancer,

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:38.150
but I don't believe that's
going to happen for you.

01:26:38.568 --> 01:26:41.111
Not on a professional level.

01:26:41.195 --> 01:26:44.531

than anyone else.

I'm sorry, Kevin.

01:26:49.871 --> 01:26:52.205

a strong enough dancer.

'Cause if you're
not really here

01:26:58.588 --> 01:27:00.756
You will never,
in my opinion,

01:27:01.466 --> 01:27:04.843
be able to support
yourself as a dancer.

01:27:05.595 --> 01:27:08.138
It's my responsibility
to tell you that.

You should continue

to be prepared.

who are going to have to
pursue other options.

01:28:25.508 --> 01:28:27.509
you might make

J EN NY: I know,
I'm so proud of you.

01:28:37.645 --> 01:28:40.605
It's Sesame Street.
Okay, who doesn't
know Sesame Street?

01:28:40.690 --> 01:28:44.150

with it at some point.

I guess you always knew

You made me
happy sometimes

01:29:06.591 --> 01:29:09.217
You made me glad

No.
No?

that like crispy cookies

that like gooey...

Yeah, he called me again.

01:30:49.694 --> 01:30:51.945
So does he want you
to record an album
or something?

01:30:52.029 --> 01:30:57.200
Yeah. He wanted me to work
with Damon and Poyser,
whoever those people are.

01:31:00.329 --> 01:31:01.955
What'd you say?

01:31:02.039 --> 01:31:03.373
I told him no.

01:31:03.457 --> 01:31:05.291

Yes, because of us.

I could sing that music.

That I loved that music.

and you don't even
respond.

at school. What's up
with that?

ready and stuff.

each other, right?

say that after P.A.,

you just go on
your separate ways.

the book, all right?
He left.

01:35:16.710 --> 01:35:21.005
After Ayanna was born.
Didn't even come back
for her funeral.

Was there anyone there
to take his place?

01:35:28.681 --> 01:35:32.267
I tried to make it
work for as long
as I possibly could.

01:35:32.351 --> 01:35:33.393
I know.

01:35:33.477 --> 01:35:35.603

I don't know
what to do.

Everything you're
ashamed of,

all the parts of yourself
that you keep secret,

01:35:53.998 --> 01:35:57.917
everything you want to
change about yourself,

01:35:58.002 --> 01:36:00.003
it's who you are.

01:36:01.088 --> 01:36:02.797
That's your power.

01:36:04.216 --> 01:36:06.968
Deny it
and you're nothing.

01:36:07.052 --> 01:36:11.347
And you'll never be
much of an actor.

This school is here to
develop you as an artist.

01:36:16.770 --> 01:36:20.023
And when you're ready,
send you out there
to go to work.

01:36:21.233 --> 01:36:22.734
Are you ready?

01:36:26.572 --> 01:36:29.240
Now, you're good, Malik.

01:36:29.325 --> 01:36:33.661
But you've got to start
breaking down those walls

01:36:33.746 --> 01:36:38.333
and accept
your circumstances.

01:36:41.337 --> 01:36:43.129

about that shit.

01:36:48.469 --> 01:36:50.094

01:36:52.556 --> 01:36:53.806
But I do.

01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:36.391

01:37:36.475 --> 01:37:38.184

you so nervous?

What does that mean?

01:37:48.862 --> 01:37:51.572
I told them some
kids from school
were performing

01:37:51.657 --> 01:37:54.117
who were,
I don't know,
musically gifted.

01:37:54.201 --> 01:37:56.869

you're singing tonight?

01:37:56.954 --> 01:37:58.121
No.

01:37:59.289 --> 01:38:01.582
But do they know
it's hip hop?

01:38:02.626 --> 01:38:05.044
I told them,
"Classical jazz."

01:38:09.591 --> 01:38:11.717
Oh, it's gonna be
good tonight.

01:40:22.099 --> 01:40:24.267

with the world and
making people feel.

It's finding a way to
bind together people

common but a dream.

the best goddamn dance
teacher there ever was.

01:47:10.757 --> 01:47:14.551

I'd ever hoped for.

01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:18.931
