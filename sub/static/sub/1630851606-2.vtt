at the Grand Street construction site!

You guys need to hurry because he's dying.
I don't know if he's already dead or not!

09:43.499 --> 09:44.333
You need to hurry!

-We can't stay here.

-Just drive!

09:58.472 --> 10:01.726
Okay, this is arguably
the worst idea we have ever had.

10:03.978 --> 10:07.148
So, while we're down in the dirt,
fighting over scraps,

10:07.231 --> 10:10.276
the real gold is
over there on Paradise Island.

10:10.943 --> 10:14.989
Cleo, how much you think was in that safe?
Huh? Off the top of your head.

10:15.072 --> 10:18.409

and definitely more than me.

10:26.292 --> 10:30.171
If it involves giving you
that rock back, that nugget, forget it.

10:30.254 --> 10:33.174
You're lucky I'm not on the phone
with the cops right now.

10:33.257 --> 10:34.592
I'm not worried about that,

10:34.675 --> 10:36.719
because you saw
what was in that safe, did you not?

10:36.802 --> 10:37.678
Yeah, I did.

10:37.762 --> 10:42.016
And it was exactly what
we told you it was gonna be. Right?

10:43.809 --> 10:46.729
Yeah, well, that thing's locked down
tighter than a clamshell now.

10:46.812 --> 10:49.106
No shit. But the gold's not staying there.

10:51.525 --> 10:53.694
My dad's gonna come down
and move it. He'll have to.

10:53.778 --> 10:56.322
So what are you proposing, a Brink's job?

10:56.405 --> 10:59.200
Think about it.
You have a boat that can get us away.

10:59.283 --> 11:01.202
You know people and the island,

11:01.285 --> 11:03.788
and I can find out
exactly when that gold is moving.

11:06.248 --> 11:07.458
And I'll give you two million.

11:08.876 --> 11:10.336
[Terrance] Let me get this straight.

11:10.419 --> 11:15.174
We take the risk
of going to jail and getting shot

11:15.257 --> 11:17.843
for a fraction of what's in that safe.

11:17.927 --> 11:21.639
After you abandoned us? Stole my boat?

11:21.722 --> 11:23.015
I don't owe you shit.

11:23.808 --> 11:24.767
But I'll give you ten.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.395
Ten million apiece.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.023
I like that. Ten apiece.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.401
Apiece? Okay.
You know what? We're getting--

11:38.864 --> 11:39.699
Ten million apiece.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.244
Ten million dollars.
We're just throwing money away.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.795
You have yourself a deal, sweetheart.

11:54.964 --> 11:58.884
Look, it was right here, and this is
where that maniac claimed his next victim.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.636
-Uh-huh. His next victim?
-Yeah.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.514
[Shoupe] Right.
How long ago did you say it happened?

12:03.597 --> 12:05.307
Forty-five minutes ago, Shoupe.

12:05.391 --> 12:06.434
Okay.

12:07.143 --> 12:10.479
And so, Ward Cameron

-Yeah.

-We filmed the entire thing.

You filmed it?

12:20.489 --> 12:23.200

Pope dropped the camera, and it broke.

get a long-distance image, and… and…

because he was on the tarmac that day.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.655

that Rafe used to kill Peterkin.

24:24.921 --> 24:26.423
Terrance, on the other hand…

24:29.468 --> 24:30.302
he's a ram goat.

24:30.385 --> 24:33.054
Anything that's in his way, ram it over.

24:33.138 --> 24:37.684
Always stay two steps ahead of him
and never really trust him.

24:39.227 --> 24:40.061
Wait here.

24:42.606 --> 24:45.400
-Who wanna make some money?
-[kids] Me! Me!

24:45.484 --> 24:46.401
But wait.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.820
I need a favor first. Listen up.

24:51.323 --> 24:52.782
[upbeat rock music playing]

24:52.866 --> 24:56.411
[JJ] This is the north drain.
It should've gotten washed into the gully.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.748
So, if it got flushed out from this drain,
it would've been pushed out to, like--

24:59.831 --> 25:02.042
-[Pope] Somewhere in this trash.
-[JJ] Correct.

25:02.125 --> 25:04.294
[sighs] Oh my God.
People who use plastic should be shot.

25:04.377 --> 25:08.632
Okay, personally, I love plastic.
Use it every day. Love the stuff.

25:08.715 --> 25:11.176
Hopefully, you recycle it
and don't let it flush into the ocean.

25:11.843 --> 25:15.847
I thought you'd say
something like that, so… trash bags.

25:15.931 --> 25:19.184
Did you just proactively protect
the environment?

25:20.227 --> 25:21.144
Maybe.

25:23.688 --> 25:26.066
You want me to leave you two alone,
or what's going on?

25:26.942 --> 25:27.859
Just pick up the trash.

25:33.698 --> 25:35.700
[dramatic music playing]

25:43.917 --> 25:44.751
Ah.

25:47.546 --> 25:48.672
Well, that was fun.

25:49.798 --> 25:52.300
If it's not in the trash,
then it's gotta be in the storm drain.

25:52.384 --> 25:53.885
It's in… it's in the drain.

25:53.969 --> 25:55.470
-Damn it.
-Of course it is.

25:56.054 --> 25:57.222
Good thing I brought the crow.

25:57.305 --> 25:59.599
So, are we gonna do,
like, rock, paper, scissors?

25:59.683 --> 26:01.309
-No.
-[Kie] Or alphabetically?

26:01.393 --> 26:03.436
Nah. On three, Pope. One, two, three.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.480
-[JJ grunts]
-Or, like, the oldest goes?

26:05.564 --> 26:08.608
In the sewer, there's this worm
that you get when you're down there.

26:08.692 --> 26:11.611
It gets into your blood,
and then it has to come out your pecker.

26:11.695 --> 26:13.780
So, uh…
that would be a hard pass for me.

26:13.863 --> 26:15.323
That's gonna be a no for me.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.867
No, I get it.
I get it. You guys are scared.

26:17.951 --> 26:19.536
-[JJ] I'm not scared.
-It's kind of cute.

26:19.619 --> 26:21.288
-It's the pecker thing.
-I'm not scared.

26:21.371 --> 26:25.041
You should've just led with that.
You don't have to be scared. I'll do it.

26:25.625 --> 26:28.420
Okay, just, you know, be careful.

26:30.005 --> 26:30.964
I'll be so careful.

26:32.257 --> 26:33.300
I deserve that.

26:35.719 --> 26:38.221
Just, uh, holler
if you need anything, okay?

26:38.305 --> 26:41.349
We'll, uh… we'll holler back.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.226
[Kie echoing] Very helpful. Thank you.

26:43.310 --> 26:46.229
Ain't good, big dog.
If that piece went down in here,

26:47.188 --> 26:49.441
it's either six inches deep
in the catch basin

26:49.524 --> 26:52.402
in some toxic shit you definitely
don't wanna be wading through,

26:52.485 --> 26:54.863
or it's way out there by that outlet.

26:55.780 --> 26:59.534
Now, the easiest thing to do
is going to be flush it.

27:00.285 --> 27:02.037
'Cause I'm gonna tell you right now

27:02.120 --> 27:04.247
my ass ain't getting down there
in that shit.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.375
Shit. [grunts]

27:09.878 --> 27:12.172
Kiara, you find anything yet?

27:12.255 --> 27:15.925
-[JJ] Yeah, Kie, do you see the gun?
-[sighs] Nothing.

27:16.009 --> 27:18.511
[Pope] It's probably
at the bottom of the catch basin.

27:20.180 --> 27:21.014
[grunting]

27:27.437 --> 27:29.439
[panting]

27:36.446 --> 27:37.280
[sighs]

27:37.822 --> 27:40.367
All right, bro,
I see you vibing on Kie, okay?

27:41.493 --> 27:44.746
Give me the details. Are we talking
first base, second base, third base?

27:44.829 --> 27:47.582
-Try not even in the same ballpark.
-What do you mean by that?

27:48.208 --> 27:50.001
It's like we're not playing the same game.

27:53.546 --> 27:55.048
People are so shitty.

27:56.049 --> 27:57.842
-The other night, we're--
-Okay.

27:57.926 --> 28:00.011
-She was all over me.
-All right.

28:00.095 --> 28:01.262
-And…
-Good start.

28:01.346 --> 28:04.265
But she was wasted,
so it doesn't really count.

28:04.349 --> 28:05.183
[groaning]

28:08.269 --> 28:10.313
Only one way
to find out now, Country Club.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.316
All right, all right, all right.

28:16.403 --> 28:18.363
I tried to be edgy, out-there Pope,

28:18.446 --> 28:19.698
and she didn't like that.

28:19.781 --> 28:22.075
So I tried to be straitlaced Pope.
She didn't like that.

28:22.158 --> 28:23.785
-I understand!
-So I don't know what to do.

28:23.868 --> 28:25.745
Pope, think.
I know you can do that, all right?

28:25.829 --> 28:28.748
Like, light some candles.
Put on some Otis Redding.

28:28.832 --> 28:30.125
Yeah. That would work.

28:30.208 --> 28:31.668
-Or play guitar.
-I can't play guitar.

28:31.751 --> 28:33.086
I can't do any of those things.

28:33.169 --> 28:34.838
[Kie] Guys, I think I found something.

28:34.921 --> 28:36.798
-Ugh, gross.
-[JJ] Wait, you got it?

28:36.881 --> 28:39.634
-[Pope] Is it the gun?
-Pope! Pope! Oh my God!

28:39.718 --> 28:42.387
You guys, there's something dead in here!

28:42.470 --> 28:43.638
-Is it--
-Like a person?

28:43.722 --> 28:44.889
[screams]

28:46.015 --> 28:47.767
[Kie shouting indistinctly]

28:47.851 --> 28:50.895
Oh my God!
There's something dead. I repeat…

28:50.979 --> 28:52.063
[Pope] Like a person?

28:52.147 --> 28:53.815
[Kie] …there is something dead in here!

28:54.607 --> 28:56.568
[JJ] Kie, don't touch it.
That's how you get worms.

28:56.651 --> 28:59.279
[Pope] Did you find the gun? Is it Gavin?

28:59.362 --> 29:01.197
[JJ] What is it? Is it Gavin?

29:01.281 --> 29:02.907
-[Pope] Don't touch it!
-[scoffs]

29:02.991 --> 29:05.827
[JJ] Kie, is it a gun?
Do you see the gun, Kie?

29:06.745 --> 29:08.121
Well, they're in the sewer.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.331
[JJ] Do you see anything?

29:12.751 --> 29:13.585
Flush them out.

29:14.461 --> 29:17.172
[scoffs] You flush that pipe,
you gonna kill the rat.

29:17.797 --> 29:18.631
Yeah.

29:19.924 --> 29:21.176
The last thing you need

29:21.259 --> 29:23.344
is more dead bodies
showing up around this bitch.

29:23.428 --> 29:25.305
You realize
what you're doing if you do that?

29:25.388 --> 29:26.931
If you wanna be a pussy, you can leave.

29:27.015 --> 29:31.853
Do you not realize
what you are doing, bro?

29:33.897 --> 29:35.315
Get the hell out of the way.

29:38.359 --> 29:39.360
All right, then.

29:40.361 --> 29:41.738
All right, then, tough guy.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.491
You don't wanna be here for this,
go find the truck, okay?

29:44.574 --> 29:46.451
[dramatic music playing]

29:52.457 --> 29:54.459
[Kie] You guys owe me for life!

29:55.710 --> 29:57.837
What if Ward put Gavin in the sewer, dude?

29:57.921 --> 29:58.755
Hold on.

29:59.255 --> 30:00.673
That makes so much sense.

30:00.757 --> 30:01.841
[water running]

30:03.134 --> 30:04.511

-[gasps]

30:19.317 --> 30:20.735
-Do you hear that?
-What?

30:22.070 --> 30:22.904
Listen.

30:25.490 --> 30:26.407
Oh, shit.

30:27.742 --> 30:28.576
Guys?

30:28.660 --> 30:30.328
Guys, the water!

30:30.912 --> 30:31.746
Shit!

30:31.830 --> 30:33.873
Kiara, get out of there now!

30:37.043 --> 30:39.420
I don't have time! Guys!

30:40.004 --> 30:41.631
Shit! Oh no!

30:42.257 --> 30:43.091
Shit.

30:43.550 --> 30:44.425
-Kie!
-Kie!

[dramatic music playing]

30:53.643 --> 30:54.602

30:54.686 --> 30:56.354
-Maybe there's a manhole!
-Kiara!

30:56.437 --> 30:57.564
Go, go, go, go!

31:00.191 --> 31:02.068
-Kiara!
-[screams]

31:02.151 --> 31:05.989
Please! Pope! Guys!

31:06.072 --> 31:07.740
-Help! I'm over here!
-[Pope] Kiara!

31:07.824 --> 31:08.992
-Kie!
-Come on!

31:09.075 --> 31:10.243
Kie, we're coming!

31:10.326 --> 31:13.121
Hey, guys! I'm over here!

31:13.204 --> 31:14.706
The water is coming up!

31:14.789 --> 31:15.707
-Kiara!
-Kie!

31:15.790 --> 31:17.458
[Kie] Pull! Pull it!

31:17.542 --> 31:20.044
-Getting close! Pull! Pull!
-[all grunting]

31:22.255 --> 31:23.798
Hurry! Hurry!

31:23.882 --> 31:25.174
[both grunting]

31:25.258 --> 31:29.178
-Pope. Pope! Please! Please!
-We'll get you out of there. I promise.

31:29.971 --> 31:30.847
Come on. Come on.

31:30.930 --> 31:32.098
JJ! Pope!

31:32.181 --> 31:35.435
-[JJ grunting]
-[Pope] Shit! [grunting]

31:35.518 --> 31:36.603
[whimpering]

31:38.313 --> 31:39.772
[Pope and JJ grunting]

31:40.398 --> 31:42.275
-[JJ] Come on!
-Come on! Come on!

31:42.358 --> 31:43.860
[both groaning]

31:48.865 --> 31:51.284
-[Kie gasping, coughing]
-[Pope and JJ panting]

31:55.455 --> 31:56.456
[Pope] Kiara.

31:59.167 --> 32:00.960
-Are you okay?
-[retching]

32:01.044 --> 32:03.880
-I thought we lost you.
-Pope, get off me. Pope, get off me!

32:03.963 --> 32:04.839
[coughing]

32:05.548 --> 32:06.424
Kie, you good?

32:07.634 --> 32:08.676
Never better.

32:08.760 --> 32:09.969
[JJ chuckling]

32:11.554 --> 32:13.556
[exhaling deeply]

32:14.390 --> 32:16.893
This wasn't
what we were looking for, right?

32:16.976 --> 32:18.686
[all laughing]

32:19.395 --> 32:21.105
-[JJ] Oh my God.
-Holy shit.

32:22.815 --> 32:23.858
Oh my God.

32:23.942 --> 32:26.069
We're gonna get
this son of a bitch, man. [laughs]

32:26.819 --> 32:27.779
Let's go, Kie.

32:28.279 --> 32:29.697
-Good job.
-Yeah.

32:29.781 --> 32:33.618
You did it, Kie. You did it.
Come on. [laughs]

32:33.701 --> 32:35.244
Let's get this to Shoupe.

32:35.328 --> 32:36.412
Okay.

32:37.872 --> 32:39.415
I looked everywhere. I swear to God.

32:39.499 --> 32:41.209
[Ward] I know.
I'm not mad at you. I'm just--

32:43.544 --> 32:47.006
Listen, if those Pogues got the gun,
we can just say John B stole it, yeah?

32:48.591 --> 32:51.260
-Yeah?
-[splutters] Yeah. He lived at the house.

32:51.344 --> 32:54.013
He's… he's a known thief. Absolutely, yes.

32:55.515 --> 32:57.767
Yeah. What about the car?

32:57.850 --> 32:59.644
I left the car at the airstrip.

33:01.938 --> 33:03.022
That's perfect.

33:03.106 --> 33:03.982
That's good work.

33:04.565 --> 33:05.400
[sighs]

33:07.026 --> 33:08.736
Thank you. Rafe, thank you.

33:16.411 --> 33:17.495
Listen, buddy, I, uh…

33:17.578 --> 33:20.206
I have to fly
to the Bahamas tomorrow, and I…

33:21.791 --> 33:22.875
Would you go with me?

33:26.212 --> 33:27.380
-Yes, sir.
-Yeah?

33:27.964 --> 33:28.798
All right.

33:29.799 --> 33:31.342
It'll be good to get you out of here.

33:31.968 --> 33:35.722
Honestly, I… just feel like
I need someone to have my back, you know?

33:36.389 --> 33:37.348
I got that.

33:37.432 --> 33:38.975
-[Ward] You got that?
-All day.

33:42.061 --> 33:43.062
You do, don't you?

33:43.146 --> 33:46.149
[sentimental music playing]

33:49.652 --> 33:50.486
Thank you, bud.

33:51.195 --> 33:52.071
Yeah.

34:11.132 --> 34:12.050
[sighs]

34:15.303 --> 34:17.847
So y'all are telling me
this is the firearm

34:17.930 --> 34:19.682
Rafe Cameron killed Peterkin with?

34:19.766 --> 34:21.267
That's exactly what we're telling you.

34:21.350 --> 34:24.062
And the exact same firearm
that Ward just used to kill Gavin.

34:24.145 --> 34:24.979
I--

34:25.813 --> 34:27.023
And where's that corpse again?

34:27.106 --> 34:28.149
Didn't you look?

34:28.232 --> 34:31.569
I checked the hospital.
I went by his house. He was out.

34:31.652 --> 34:33.362
-He was out?
-No shit! 'Cause he's dead!

34:33.446 --> 34:35.573
Listen to yourself.
It makes perfect sense.

34:35.656 --> 34:38.618
Just because he's not in his damn home

34:38.701 --> 34:41.037
does not mean
he was a victim of a homicide.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.331
-[Kie] What are you talking about?
-You gotta be kidding.

34:43.414 --> 34:45.708
Are you at least gonna
send it in for ballistics and shit,

34:45.792 --> 34:47.293
or are you just gonna sit on your ass?

34:47.376 --> 34:49.629
He'll sit there and wax that mustache.
Is that even real?

34:49.712 --> 34:51.547
-I'll wax this--
-[Pope] Shut up, JJ!

34:51.631 --> 34:52.632
It's not fair.

34:52.715 --> 34:54.967
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt his feelings?

34:55.051 --> 34:56.094
Shut up!

34:59.430 --> 35:01.432
-Get out. I got work to do.
-Are you serious?

35:01.516 --> 35:03.726
-[Shoupe] Y'all are smelling up my office.
-[Pope] Shit.

35:06.813 --> 35:09.440
Did Ward bribe you?
This doesn't make any sense.

35:10.942 --> 35:12.485
You ain't gonna do shit.

35:12.568 --> 35:13.402
Out!

35:20.076 --> 35:21.369
We brought you the murder weapon.

35:21.452 --> 35:24.247
There's no logical reason
for you not to send it in.

35:26.165 --> 35:27.291
Go with your friends.

35:29.794 --> 35:30.920
This is bullshit.

35:31.003 --> 35:32.922
[dramatic music playing]

36:06.330 --> 36:07.415
Son of a bitch.

36:21.262 --> 36:23.472

36:23.556 --> 36:25.933
[Kie] Oh my God. That was disgusting.

36:28.728 --> 36:30.605
-Here.
-[Kie] Thanks.

36:39.572 --> 36:41.949
I feel like an actual human being again.

36:43.868 --> 36:45.953
Yeah, well,
you actually smell like one now.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.538
Stop, Pope. For real.

36:48.831 --> 36:50.208
I'm… I'm sorry. I thought--

36:50.958 --> 36:53.544
You know, a few days ago,
you were all over me and--

36:53.628 --> 36:57.423
Yeah. I was super high.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.050
Oh.

37:01.093 --> 37:03.638
Look, Pope,
I still have sewage in my lungs,

37:03.721 --> 37:05.848
and Shoupe pissed me off.

37:12.104 --> 37:13.731
Just see what happens.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.069
Okay?

37:18.903 --> 37:19.862
Okay.

["Don't You Forget It"

37:30.915 --> 37:34.377
Wait, um, I think Wheezie knows something.
I feel like she's talking to somebody.

37:34.460 --> 37:36.879
-It… it doesn't matter, okay?
-It doesn't matter?

37:36.963 --> 37:39.131
It doesn't. We're a day away
from this thing being done.

37:39.215 --> 37:42.093
I go down, I get the gold on a flight,
and that's it. It's all over.

37:42.176 --> 37:45.471
-Just keep an eye on her, okay?
-Yeah. Okay.

[Ward] Rafe, I didn't just bring you here
because I need your help.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.500
I wanna show you something.

38:16.460 --> 38:20.381
-Is this the deal you've been working on?
-You could say that.

38:22.174 --> 38:23.426
[buttons beeping on safe]

38:29.390 --> 38:30.474
You ready?

38:31.058 --> 38:32.685
What do you got in there?
The Hope Diamond?

38:32.768 --> 38:34.937
[both laughing]

38:43.946 --> 38:44.780
Is that real?

38:45.656 --> 38:47.408
Son, that's the realest thing there is.

38:54.832 --> 38:55.666
[Rafe] How…

39:00.421 --> 39:01.339
[Ward] I found it.

39:02.548 --> 39:03.382
You found…

39:06.135 --> 39:07.303
You found the Royal Merchant?

39:08.804 --> 39:10.306
It's what all this has been about.

39:13.809 --> 39:14.643
All this gold,

39:17.271 --> 39:18.105
it's ours now.

39:20.024 --> 39:21.192
Jesus.

39:22.026 --> 39:26.030
It can't bring your sister back,
but it can save us.

39:28.908 --> 39:31.702
See, Rafe,
by the time Hurricane Agatha hit…

39:33.871 --> 39:35.706
we were in a financial hole, a deep one.

39:37.124 --> 39:38.000
[sighs]

39:42.213 --> 39:44.256
-We're not in a hole anymore.
-[chuckles]

39:45.383 --> 39:48.094
I mean, I'm looking…
I'm looking at what here?

39:48.677 --> 39:49.512
Half a billion.

39:53.641 --> 39:54.600
Half a billion.

39:54.683 --> 39:56.060
Oh my God.

39:56.977 --> 39:58.562

40:02.733 --> 40:05.403
Dad! What? How is this possible, huh?

40:05.486 --> 40:09.115
This is what I need to tell you.
Look at me. Look. I'm hard on you, Rafe.

40:10.032 --> 40:12.535
I'm real hard on you, all right?

40:12.618 --> 40:13.994
-I know that.
-Yeah.

40:15.162 --> 40:16.122

40:16.205 --> 40:19.458
That's why you need to hear this.

Yeah.

[sentimental music playing]

40:24.171 --> 40:25.714
This is what was on the cargo plane.

40:27.758 --> 40:30.052
You are the only reason
we were able to fly that out.

40:30.761 --> 40:31.846
You, Rafe.

40:33.347 --> 40:34.181
No gold.

is bring the car to the airport.

42:08.692 --> 42:10.152
It's about a half hour from here.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.706

in the truck with the gold, right?

42:27.127 --> 42:28.420

Two?

42:31.257 --> 42:32.216

Well, can you let just one truck through?

[Cleo] I don't think so.
Sinkhole. Massive.

This is what we'll do.
You're gonna walk to the sign.

You'll put those signs on the side for me.
You go to that sign. You go to that sign.
