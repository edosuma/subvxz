00:24.274 --> 00:26.985
Theorizing that
one could time-travel

00:27.027 --> 00:28.529
within his own lifetime,

00:28.612 --> 00:31.907
Dr. Sam Beckett stepped into
the Quantum Leap Accelerator

00:32.073 --> 00:33.325
and vanished.

00:38.622 --> 00:41.166
He woke to find himself
trapped in the past,

00:41.708 --> 00:44.378
facing mirror images
that were not his own,

00:44.795 --> 00:46.880
and driven by
an unknown force

00:46.964 --> 00:49.383
to change history
for the better.

00:49.967 --> 00:52.177
His only guide on
this journey is Al,

00:52.261 --> 00:54.304
an observer from his own time,

00:54.638 --> 00:56.723
who appears in the form
of a hologram

00:56.890 --> 00:58.976
that only Sam
can see and hear.

00:59.393 --> 01:03.438
And so Dr. Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,

01:03.814 --> 01:06.358
striving to put right
what once went wrong

01:06.900 --> 01:09.486
and hoping each time
that his next leap

01:10.237 --> 01:11.905
will be the leap home.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.048
Witchcraft in America...

01:32.926 --> 01:36.680
by the Reverend
John T. Immendorf, Boston.

01:38.140 --> 01:39.892
1879.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.729
1879?

01:53.614 --> 01:55.115
That's not possible.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.868
Hello?
Hello?

02:00.621 --> 02:01.872
Anybody here?

03:49.897 --> 03:53.025
Josh. Josh, are you okay?

03:58.155 --> 03:59.156
Huh?

03:59.239 --> 04:01.575
Josh, are you okay?

04:04.411 --> 04:06.038
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

04:06.121 --> 04:07.581
I'm sorry, Mr. Rey.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.500
I... I didn't mean
to scare you like that.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.921
It's okay. Really.

04:14.838 --> 04:17.466
Oh, oh, man, look at the time.
It's almost 12:15.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.843
Um, is it all right
if I go?

04:19.927 --> 04:22.721
I still gotta peel those
grapes for the bowl of eyeballs.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.640
Yeah... yeah, i-it's fine.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.768
Hey, do you need any more
gopher guts or anything?

04:28.227 --> 04:29.228
Uh, no.

04:29.937 --> 04:32.940
No, I think we got
enough gopher guts.

04:33.023 --> 04:34.608
You sure?

04:34.900 --> 04:36.068
Well, maybe not.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.362
Okay, I'll... I'll pick up
some more spaghetti and liver.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.155
And I think we've got
enough pumpkins.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.824
Assuming we ever
finish carving them.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.369
Yeah, well...

04:46.036 --> 04:47.412
You know me, I mean,

04:47.829 --> 04:51.750
"Have knife,
will carve pumpkins. "

04:52.543 --> 04:56.421
You know, Josh,
sometimes you are very scary.

04:58.841 --> 05:00.884
That's why I can't wait
till we get married.

05:04.763 --> 05:09.268
It burns! It burns!
Renfield, my coffin!

05:12.980 --> 05:14.439
And you think I'm scary.

05:15.357 --> 05:17.150
One of these days
I'm gonna write

05:17.234 --> 05:19.444
the scariest book in
the whole wide world.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.363
Except, then nobody
would probably buy it.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.240
We would, wouldn't we?

05:24.241 --> 05:25.993
Uh, a-as long
as we're in it.

05:26.076 --> 05:27.160
Yeah.

05:27.244 --> 05:30.998
Hey, Mary, is it okay if I come by
around 5:00 to pick up my costume?

05:31.081 --> 05:33.333
That is, assuming that
my car doesn't break down.

05:33.417 --> 05:34.418
Ask Josh.

05:34.877 --> 05:37.296
I'm in charge of maiming
overgrown vegetables.

05:37.379 --> 05:39.715
He's in charge of
disturbing wardrobes.

05:40.215 --> 05:42.217
Uh, 5:00 would be perfect.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.304
If we're not here,
we'll leave it on the porch.

05:45.637 --> 05:46.638
Great!

05:47.514 --> 05:48.640
Bye, Stevie.

05:49.016 --> 05:52.060
Is this gonna be the best haunted
house we ever had, or what?

06:05.365 --> 06:06.742
Great scarecrow.

06:08.577 --> 06:09.828
Yeah, it is.

06:11.914 --> 06:13.457
The problem
with Quantum Leaping

06:13.540 --> 06:15.834
is that it often left me
feeling like a scarecrow.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.628
With my head
all full of stuffing,

06:17.711 --> 06:19.963
and no idea as to why
I was really there.

06:20.631 --> 06:22.341
Josh, yoo-hoo.

06:24.134 --> 06:25.719
I- I'm sorry.
W- what were you saying?

06:25.802 --> 06:27.179
I was thinking
of something else.

06:27.221 --> 06:28.305
I could tell.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.807
You're worried about how
to kill him, aren't you?

06:30.849 --> 06:32.184
I know it's a problem.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.520
I... I... I don't want
to kill anybody.

06:34.603 --> 06:37.523
Well, if you don't, I don't
know what you're going to do.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.691
Unless you rewrite
the whole book.

06:40.692 --> 06:42.402
And you don't
want to do that.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.947
So I guess you'll just
have to kill him.

06:45.322 --> 06:48.242
Right! Right,
I mean... I mean,

06:49.701 --> 06:51.453
how else
could I end the book?

06:51.745 --> 06:54.873
Maybe you could burn him at the
stake, like Alice what's-her-name,

06:54.957 --> 06:57.376
who used to live here
before she moved to Salem.

07:06.385 --> 07:07.636
Uh,

07:07.719 --> 07:10.097
weren't the Salem witch trials
in 1690...

07:10.180 --> 07:11.223
'92.

07:11.306 --> 07:12.850
'92. Right.
I know.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.478
I think it's cool
to kill a guy in 1964,

07:16.562 --> 07:18.897
the same way they used to
hundreds of years ago.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.733
Then his ghost can come back
and haunt everyone,

07:21.775 --> 07:24.528
the way Alice's is supposed
to haunt this place.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.577
I don't think she likes
that idea too much.

07:31.660 --> 07:34.371
Tully, could you bang
a little louder, please?

07:37.541 --> 07:40.002
He said he'd have those
windows finished by noon.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.920
Maybe you could go up
and talk to him.

07:42.004 --> 07:43.297
Oh, okay.

07:45.716 --> 07:48.260
Yeah, I'll go talk
to him right now.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.433
Unbelievable.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.603
I've leaped into
The Addams Family.

08:26.089 --> 08:28.133
Worm Dancer, Joshua Rey.

08:28.383 --> 08:30.219
Skull Party, Joshua Rey.

08:30.302 --> 08:32.054
The Blood Witch, Joshua Rey.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.265
Burning Fires.
Aye... aye... aye.

08:57.538 --> 08:58.956
"An eel of smoke

08:59.122 --> 09:02.918
"slowly slithered through the
sockets of the moldy skull,

09:03.418 --> 09:06.338
an evil from
the beginning of time. "

09:07.130 --> 09:08.340
Oh, brother.

09:08.382 --> 09:11.885
An evil that you'd be doing
well enough to let alone.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.017
You know what
they say, don't you?

09:20.394 --> 09:21.979
Wh-what do they say,

09:23.021 --> 09:24.064
Tully?

09:24.147 --> 09:28.277
Them that dance with the Devil
are bound to get scorched.

09:28.569 --> 09:29.653
Yeah, well, uh...

09:36.076 --> 09:39.872
Real nice job you're doing
on the windows out here.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.040
Alice McHorner
danced with him.

09:43.125 --> 09:44.626
Burned her at the stake.

09:45.961 --> 09:48.338
You're talking like it
happened just yesterday.

09:48.755 --> 09:51.091
What's time
to Old Scratch?

09:51.592 --> 09:53.844
Yesterday's tomorrow for him.

09:54.094 --> 09:57.055
Mark my words, you want
no part of his business

09:57.097 --> 09:59.933
because there's only one thing
he's selling, and that's...

10:10.444 --> 10:13.447
Josh! Josh, what's the matter?
What's going on?

10:17.826 --> 10:19.077
He's dead.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.835
I think his... his neck
is broken.

10:29.630 --> 10:32.466
One minute he was just
talking to me, and then

10:34.051 --> 10:36.970
the goat,
he yanked on the rag

10:37.095 --> 10:38.805
a- and the ladder
slipped, and... and

10:41.058 --> 10:42.684
that was it.

10:42.893 --> 10:43.894
Goat?

10:46.939 --> 10:48.106
Yeah, the goat.

10:48.357 --> 10:49.858
Can you describe it?

10:51.151 --> 10:52.444
It was a goat.

10:53.237 --> 10:54.738
It looked like
any other goat.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.490
It was white,
and it had horns.

10:56.573 --> 10:57.866
Josh, you don't have a goat.

10:57.950 --> 10:59.243
It was right there.

10:59.952 --> 11:02.996
Maybe, it was
somebody else's goat.

11:03.121 --> 11:06.583
Yeah, yeah, maybe it was somebody
else's goat. I don't know.

11:06.667 --> 11:07.918
Next farm's 20 miles.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.461
Are you saying
that I pushed him?

11:09.503 --> 11:11.213
'Cause that's crazy.
It was the goat.

11:11.380 --> 11:14.842
Sam, you don't think
maybe unintentionally...

11:14.925 --> 11:16.677
It was an accident.
Of course it was.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.679
Of course.
Of course.

11:20.681 --> 11:23.517
Mary, I'd like to get your
statement down, too, before I go.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.394
Sure, Ben.
Could we do it inside?

11:25.477 --> 11:27.104
Between the rush
for the spook house,

11:27.145 --> 11:28.897
and now this,
my head's kind of...

11:29.022 --> 11:30.107
I'd like to sit down.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.149
Certainly.

11:31.233 --> 11:32.484
Speaking of which,

11:33.026 --> 11:35.070
maybe we should
cancel the spook house.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.197
Well, that's something
to think about.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.324
But if you do, there's
gonna be a lot of people

11:39.408 --> 11:40.993
who're gonna be disappointed.

11:41.076 --> 11:42.995
And the truth of the times
is that, well,

11:43.161 --> 11:45.122
some people die
and the rest of us

11:45.497 --> 11:46.582
go on.

11:46.665 --> 11:48.000
I just thought
I'd bring it up.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.459
Of course.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.379
Mary.

11:52.796 --> 11:53.964
Excuse me.

11:58.719 --> 12:01.180
I could have saved him, Al,
if I had a little warning.

12:01.263 --> 12:04.183
Don't blame me or Ziggy.
We knew nothing about this.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.519
I'm sorry, Al, I just...

12:08.437 --> 12:10.981
If I wasn't here to save
Tully, what am I doing here?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.858
Well, let's see.
Uh,

12:13.025 --> 12:16.695
it's October 31, 1964,
your name is...

12:16.778 --> 12:18.238
Joshua Rey.
Uh-huh.

12:18.322 --> 12:20.908
You're kind of a second-rate
H.P. Lovecraft.

12:20.991 --> 12:25.162
You live in Coventry, Maine, and
you're engaged to Mary Greeley,

12:25.204 --> 12:28.957
who's the organist for the
Coventry Presbyterian Church.

12:29.041 --> 12:31.418
She's also your part-time
research assistant, and...

12:31.502 --> 12:32.711
Uh-oh.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.547
Tonight at midnight,

12:36.548 --> 12:38.425
she's found strangled

12:39.092 --> 12:41.303
in the church spook house,

12:41.970 --> 12:43.430
which is right there.

12:48.185 --> 12:50.479
Al, Ziggy doesn't think
that I...

12:50.562 --> 12:53.148
That... that Joshua Rey
killed her, does he?

12:54.233 --> 12:55.234
No.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.862
That is, uh, probably not.

13:00.656 --> 13:01.657
Probably?

13:03.033 --> 13:05.661
Yeah, well, you were
the logical suspect,

13:05.744 --> 13:09.665
but there was never enough
evidence to justify your arrest.

13:11.416 --> 13:12.417
Look,

13:13.043 --> 13:15.212
if I leap into
a murderer's life,

13:15.504 --> 13:17.714
then I, Sam Beckett,

13:17.798 --> 13:19.424
I'm not gonna kill
an innocent person.

13:19.508 --> 13:22.553
So then I've accomplished what I'm
here for, and I should leap, right?

13:22.636 --> 13:24.763
Right. Unless
she wasn't innocent.

13:26.932 --> 13:28.851
This is getting
too weird, Al.

13:29.560 --> 13:32.271
I don't understand why Ziggy
didn't pick up on Tully's death.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.147
I mean, he should have
spotted that.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.650
Ziggy swears
he didn't have a clue.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.694
I- It just kind of happened.

13:38.902 --> 13:42.322
Al, somebody made a mistake
and a man is dead.

13:44.241 --> 13:46.577
Do you know what kind
of snake that is? What?

13:46.618 --> 13:48.287
That's a black mamba.

13:48.412 --> 13:50.831
That's one of the
deadliest snakes...

13:50.914 --> 13:52.791
Al, I want you
to run a check on Ziggy.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.960
I don't want to miss
anything else, okay?

13:56.211 --> 13:58.297
I thought
I'd close the window.

13:58.964 --> 14:00.632
Uh, thanks, Mary.

14:03.051 --> 14:04.303
Would you like me to get it?

14:04.469 --> 14:05.762
No, I'll get it.

14:19.943 --> 14:21.361
Let's go to my office.

14:23.822 --> 14:27.159
Sam, this isn't an office,
this is a crypt.

14:27.326 --> 14:28.493
You're telling me.

14:28.827 --> 14:32.498
His parents must've read him stories by
Edgar Allan Poe when they put him to sleep.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.340
Al, listen to this:

14:41.381 --> 14:43.842
"A second later,
the goat tugged at the rag.

14:43.926 --> 14:46.303
"Tully toppled off the ladder
and crashed to the ground.

14:46.345 --> 14:47.763
He never got up again. "

14:47.846 --> 14:49.306
This wasn't here before.

14:50.974 --> 14:54.853
Then there's someone with a very
sick sense of humor wandering around.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.360
But the only one
who could've done it...

15:01.443 --> 15:02.402
Josh,

15:02.486 --> 15:04.404
that was Dorothy on the phone.

15:05.614 --> 15:08.367
Maybe she did more
than close the window.

15:09.660 --> 15:10.661
Yes?

15:10.786 --> 15:12.538
She wants to stop by
and bring over

15:12.621 --> 15:14.331
some candlesticks
for the spook house.

15:14.373 --> 15:16.208
I didn't tell her
about Tully.

15:16.333 --> 15:18.168
I thought we should
do that in person.

15:18.502 --> 15:21.964
Uh, Ziggy says she's talking about
Dorothy Yeager, the town gossip.

15:22.381 --> 15:25.843
Yeah, s-sure. That's
usually the best way.

15:28.011 --> 15:29.555
Don't worry, Sam.

15:29.638 --> 15:31.348
We're gonna figure out
what's going on.

15:31.390 --> 15:33.350
I'm gonna get Ziggy
on it right away.

15:35.185 --> 15:36.228
You do that.

15:36.311 --> 15:38.105
I will.
And in the meantime,

15:38.689 --> 15:42.401
I'd keep my eye on you-know-who,
if you know what I mean.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.862
I'm here to help her.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.282
I know.
All I'm saying is,

15:48.574 --> 15:50.826
that letter didn't
type itself.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.203
I always told him

15:53.287 --> 15:55.789
he was too old
to be playing handyman.

15:57.332 --> 16:00.252
But he had a head
harder than a frozen pipe.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.757
Do you remember the time
he put his back out

16:05.841 --> 16:07.801
trying to cement
your root cellar?

16:08.927 --> 16:10.345
Yeah, that was painful.

16:11.430 --> 16:13.182
Or the time
he was going to install

16:13.265 --> 16:14.975
your dishwasher
in your kitchen?

16:15.350 --> 16:18.562
You were knee-deep in water before
anybody could say apricot jelly.

16:18.604 --> 16:20.230
I was so mad, I could kill.

16:20.355 --> 16:22.774
Oh, I wonder if you could
lend me a hand.

16:22.858 --> 16:25.819
I left the candlesticks in
the car. They were so heavy.

16:25.903 --> 16:27.779
I'd forgotten how much
silver weighed.

16:27.905 --> 16:29.781
No, no, no, you stay here.
I'll get them.

16:36.622 --> 16:38.415
You're a very lucky young man.

16:38.874 --> 16:40.292
She's very special.

16:41.960 --> 16:44.087
You don't get
a girl like that

16:44.296 --> 16:46.131
without making
some enemies, do you?

16:46.256 --> 16:48.133
Oh, my gracious, no.

16:48.634 --> 16:50.385
We're all only human.

16:51.512 --> 16:54.973
No, I thought Ben Masters
was fixing to pitch a fit,

16:55.015 --> 16:57.809
but I think the best man won.

16:59.978 --> 17:01.063
Thanks.

17:01.146 --> 17:03.524
And thanks, Dorothy. We'll
get these back to you tomorrow.

17:03.607 --> 17:05.526
No rush. I haven't
used them in ages.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.486
Would you like
some more apple cider?

17:07.653 --> 17:09.488
Only if I can get you some.

17:09.780 --> 17:12.616
Thank goodness I'm still not
too old to carry a pitcher.

17:12.824 --> 17:16.078
It's on the counter next to the
stove, buried between some pumpkins.

17:16.161 --> 17:17.119
I'll find it.

17:19.039 --> 17:22.000
Well, now all we have to do is
finish carving those pumpkins

17:22.041 --> 17:23.919
and we'll be set.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.380
Sam, you don't have anything
to worry about.

17:26.463 --> 17:27.464
That's great.

17:27.548 --> 17:30.425
Ziggy's run a complete check
on the probability matrix

17:30.509 --> 17:33.387
of everyone you've come in
contact with, or are likely to.

17:33.929 --> 17:36.306
And Mary is definitely
the one you're here for.

17:38.183 --> 17:39.351
You know, Mary,

17:40.769 --> 17:42.938
on... on second thought,
maybe we really should

17:43.021 --> 17:44.439
cancel the spook house.

17:44.565 --> 17:46.024
I- It doesn't seem right.

17:46.108 --> 17:47.442
Josh,

17:47.526 --> 17:49.611
Tully was an accident,
that's all.

17:49.903 --> 17:52.114
It's not like this is
one of your books.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.699
I know, but I just...

17:55.242 --> 17:56.368
Dorothy!

18:07.045 --> 18:08.547
She's dead!

18:09.548 --> 18:11.133
No. No.

18:37.409 --> 18:39.369
It went down there
and disappeared.

18:42.331 --> 18:45.542
I want to know what's going on,
Al, and I want to know right now.

18:45.584 --> 18:47.002
Run another check
on the Sheriff.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.420
Tear Ziggy apart
if you have to,

18:48.504 --> 18:49.546
but I want to find out

18:49.588 --> 18:51.507
who put that black mamba
in the kitchen!

18:58.430 --> 19:01.225
I just can't believe
two deaths in one day.

19:01.266 --> 19:03.477
It's incredible.

19:03.936 --> 19:06.522
And they were both
so bizarre.

19:08.273 --> 19:11.610
Then all
those questions.

19:13.111 --> 19:14.947
I feel like
I'm going to throw up.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.201
Police questioning
has a way of doing that.

19:19.827 --> 19:21.870
Tell you what.
Why don't you, uh,

19:21.995 --> 19:24.498
go inside and... and
make us some tea and, uh,

19:25.040 --> 19:27.584
I'll see if I can find
something for your stomach, okay?

19:27.668 --> 19:28.752
Mmm.

19:46.979 --> 19:49.314
There is
a logical explanation, Sam.

19:49.398 --> 19:50.440
No.

19:50.649 --> 19:53.151
I told you, Al, she didn't
do it. She couldn't have.

19:53.235 --> 19:54.486
Just look at her eyes.

19:54.528 --> 19:56.697
Maybe she's wearing
contact lenses.

19:56.780 --> 19:58.574
Maybe she's a great
poker player.

19:58.657 --> 20:01.160
I knew a guy, you could look
him in the eye and couldn't tell

20:01.243 --> 20:04.997
whether he had four of a kind or a
busted flush. You're a scientist, Sam,

20:05.080 --> 20:06.623
you gotta explore
all possibilities.

20:06.707 --> 20:08.250
She's not one of them.

20:08.417 --> 20:10.961
What'd she do, Al? Teach
the goat to pull a rag out

20:11.044 --> 20:12.171
from underneath a ladder?

20:12.254 --> 20:14.006
Well, that's if
there was a goat.

20:14.089 --> 20:16.341
She could've pushed the ladder
from a lower window

20:16.383 --> 20:17.426
and you didn't see it.

20:17.509 --> 20:18.594
I saw the goat.

20:19.011 --> 20:20.470
Well,
she could've killed Dorothy.

20:20.512 --> 20:23.849
She could've put the snake on
the counter next to the pitcher.

20:28.604 --> 20:29.855
What about Masters?

20:29.897 --> 20:31.023
What did you find on him?

20:31.106 --> 20:32.065
The Sheriff?

20:32.441 --> 20:34.776
We've run every test
we could think of.

20:35.652 --> 20:37.362
Ziggy checks out perfectly.

20:37.779 --> 20:42.034
Sam, there's something hinky
going on around here.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.536
Come on, there's a logical
explanation for everything.

20:44.620 --> 20:45.871
Now, you know that.
We just...

20:45.913 --> 20:47.206
We just haven't found it yet.

20:47.247 --> 20:49.208
Well, we have,
but you won't admit it.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.375
No!
Yes!

20:50.542 --> 20:51.668
No! Look.

20:53.712 --> 20:57.674
"A second after Dorothy moved
aside the pumpkin, the snake struck.

20:58.133 --> 21:00.761
"It was hard to say
which killed her first,

21:00.844 --> 21:02.804
"the venom
or the heart attack.

21:02.888 --> 21:05.182
Either way, she was dead. "

21:06.683 --> 21:08.060
Where is Mary now?

21:08.602 --> 21:10.187
She's downstairs
in the kitchen.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.397
Probably sharpening knives.

21:13.815 --> 21:17.027
What are you telling me, she's
some sort of a demented psychopath?

21:18.070 --> 21:19.696
Did she do anything
strange today?

21:19.738 --> 21:20.864
Anything at all?
No!

21:20.906 --> 21:22.407
How about before
Dorothy came over?

21:22.449 --> 21:24.952
No, she... she stayed
in the kitchen,

21:26.411 --> 21:27.538
carving pumpkins.

21:27.663 --> 21:28.914
Who are you talking to?

21:30.123 --> 21:31.333
Uh, n-no,

21:31.416 --> 21:34.253
I was just trying to think
of some dialogue for my book.

21:34.294 --> 21:36.380
You called me
a demented psychopath.

21:36.421 --> 21:37.923
No, I didn't.

21:38.090 --> 21:39.591
Maybe she's
a schizophrenic.

21:39.675 --> 21:42.719
Maybe she forgot about grabbing
the snake and typing this.

21:43.387 --> 21:47.140
Mary, a lot of strange things
have been happening

21:47.683 --> 21:49.852
around here,
a- and they're sort of...

21:49.977 --> 21:52.145
Well, they're unexplainable.

21:52.271 --> 21:53.689
You think
I'm the explanation?

21:53.814 --> 21:55.274
You think I killed Tully?

21:55.315 --> 21:56.316
No.
Yes!

21:56.400 --> 21:57.401
And Dorothy?
No!

21:57.484 --> 21:59.319
Yes! How could you think that of me?

21:59.403 --> 22:00.779
If you don't want
to get married,

22:00.863 --> 22:02.364
why don't you
come out and say it

22:02.447 --> 22:04.533
instead of hiding behind
some insane accusation

22:04.616 --> 22:06.076
that I committed murder!

22:06.160 --> 22:07.369
How do I know it wasn't you?

22:07.452 --> 22:08.537
Mary.

22:08.620 --> 22:10.289
Because you're
the one who did it.

22:10.330 --> 22:13.000
I'm just trying to eliminate
all the possibilities.

22:13.083 --> 22:15.085
I... I... I really don't think...
Yes, you do!

22:15.169 --> 22:16.753
You're calling me a murderer.

22:25.304 --> 22:29.600
Sam, I don't like things
that fly around without wings.

22:29.641 --> 22:31.852
I don't know what you're
doing, but it's not funny.

22:31.935 --> 22:32.936
I didn't do anything!

22:33.020 --> 22:34.062
She's a witch.

22:34.146 --> 22:35.981
It didn't fly across
the room by itself.

22:36.064 --> 22:38.775
She's like, what's-her-name,
the one that used to live here.

22:38.817 --> 22:41.111
I'm telling you, I didn't...

22:43.655 --> 22:44.823
Uh-oh!

22:48.869 --> 22:51.580
This is like The Exorcist.
She's possessed!

22:51.872 --> 22:54.541
She's having a seizure, Al.
She's epileptic.

22:54.666 --> 22:56.001
What about the skull?

22:56.084 --> 22:57.419
Forget about the damned skull!

22:57.961 --> 23:00.255
We've gotta get her
to a hospital!

23:02.174 --> 23:04.676
If we don't get her there
quick, she could die.

23:09.306 --> 23:12.476
Ziggy's never said anything
about her being epileptic.

23:13.852 --> 23:15.646
Ziggy hadn't said
a lot of things.

23:17.523 --> 23:20.025
But that would
explain the skull.

23:20.108 --> 23:21.777
What?

23:22.903 --> 23:24.988
Psychokinesis
is very real, Al.

23:26.365 --> 23:29.743
The brain works
on a chemo-electrical level.

23:30.035 --> 23:33.205
Epilepsy is a sort of
crossing of the wires.

23:33.372 --> 23:36.542
So that maybe when her
neurons short-circuited,

23:37.292 --> 23:39.878
maybe it stimulated
her psychokinetic energy.

23:40.420 --> 23:43.674
But that still doesn't explain
Tully and Dorothy.

23:43.799 --> 23:46.218
No. But you don't kill someone
without a motive.

23:46.260 --> 23:48.470
Unless you're a psychopath.

23:49.471 --> 23:51.431
What's her motive?
Uh...

23:51.515 --> 23:53.559
Only if there's a motive
is there a connection.

23:53.851 --> 23:56.270
Well, the way to find out
about that is...

23:56.353 --> 24:00.023
Or disprove it. Or disprove
it, is to go to where she lives,

24:00.065 --> 24:01.859
which is

24:03.485 --> 24:06.780
966 Salem Avenue.

24:18.250 --> 24:20.002
Well, what are you
waiting for?

24:26.550 --> 24:29.511
Uh, women and holograms first.

24:29.761 --> 24:31.597
It's only a house, Sam.

24:35.434 --> 24:36.685
Sam!

24:36.768 --> 24:38.395
All right.
Right. Okay.

24:47.362 --> 24:50.199
What do you call
all this weird stuff, Sam?

24:53.494 --> 24:56.663
It's probably just research
material for Joshua's book.

24:57.331 --> 25:01.251
Yeah. And Tully and Dorothy were
probably just a field experiment.

25:01.585 --> 25:03.295
What have you got
against her?

25:03.462 --> 25:05.797
When she's around,
people die.

25:05.839 --> 25:07.841
How's that for starters?
Coincidence.

25:08.091 --> 25:10.552
Well, it's a kind that Ziggy's
never seen before.

25:11.178 --> 25:13.722
Second, she can
make things fly.

25:13.805 --> 25:15.140
We settled all that, Al.

25:15.224 --> 25:16.892
Maybe you did, not me.

25:17.976 --> 25:21.021
She's probably got a broomstick
hidden around here somewhere.

25:21.855 --> 25:24.858
And third, she's in the hospital,
and you haven't leaped yet.

25:26.652 --> 25:28.862
Okay. Okay,
but that means

25:29.238 --> 25:31.281
that she still
gets killed,

25:31.365 --> 25:33.534
which makes her a victim,
not a murderer.

25:34.076 --> 25:37.704
Unless her intended victim
killed her in self-defense.

25:37.996 --> 25:41.625
No, then I'm here to help a
murderer, which is ridiculous.

25:42.334 --> 25:43.418
But...

25:46.129 --> 25:47.589
Take a look at this, Al.

25:48.507 --> 25:50.968
It's the church bulletin
for Coventry Presbyterian.

25:51.051 --> 25:52.636
Look at the Board of Deacons.

25:52.678 --> 25:56.306
Mary Greeley, Tully
Maltin, Dorothy Yeager.

25:56.807 --> 25:59.184
Who would want to kill
all the Board of Deacons?

25:59.226 --> 26:03.188
How about a schizophrenic
horror novelist?

26:06.024 --> 26:07.985
Um, Mary asked me
to come by

26:08.068 --> 26:09.862
and... and, uh, pick up
some of her things.

26:09.903 --> 26:10.904
Really?

26:10.988 --> 26:12.155
Yeah.

26:16.160 --> 26:17.536
That's interesting.

26:17.911 --> 26:19.955
Particularly since I just came
from the hospital

26:20.038 --> 26:22.666
and they said she still hadn't
recovered consciousness yet.

26:22.708 --> 26:26.128
Well, she asked me
before she had

26:26.879 --> 26:28.255
her episode.

26:28.630 --> 26:30.048
How convenient.

26:32.509 --> 26:33.719
Sam.

26:33.802 --> 26:35.554
That's an unusual
tattoo, Sheriff.

26:37.014 --> 26:38.307
Okay, you caught me.

26:38.891 --> 26:41.476
I'm really a warlock, and
that's the sign of my coven.

26:41.560 --> 26:43.770
I knew it.
And I killed Dorothy and Tully

26:43.854 --> 26:45.480
because they were
about to expose me.

26:45.564 --> 26:46.899
Grab him, Sam!

26:46.982 --> 26:49.943
"That's interesting,"
to quote a sheriff I know.

26:50.402 --> 26:51.445
Isn't it?

26:51.778 --> 26:55.324
Unless, of course, the real story is
I got drunk one night on shore leave

26:55.407 --> 26:58.327
and almost had an Air
Force tattoo put on my arm.

26:58.410 --> 27:00.579
Pretty embarrassing
for a guy in the Navy.

27:00.662 --> 27:01.663
I'll say.

27:01.747 --> 27:03.999
So what's the real story
for you being here?

27:04.124 --> 27:05.459
Same as yours.

27:05.792 --> 27:06.835
Murder.

27:06.919 --> 27:08.587
Discovering clues

27:09.755 --> 27:11.131
or eliminating them?

27:13.926 --> 27:17.471
Sheriff, you know, you were in
the kitchen before Dorothy died.

27:17.554 --> 27:19.556
You could've put the
snake there. But I didn't.

27:19.640 --> 27:22.434
I found a broken wooden match
on the floor near her legs.

27:22.518 --> 27:25.812
You got a gas stove. You
light gas stoves with matches.

27:25.938 --> 27:27.022
Sam,

27:27.105 --> 27:31.318
I'm going to go back and have Gushie
run some more things by, uh, Ziggy

27:31.401 --> 27:33.570
because maybe he can
come up with something new.

27:33.654 --> 27:35.948
Sheriff, if I were you,
I would be, uh,

27:36.198 --> 27:38.575
looking for a connection
to the Board of Deacons.

27:38.617 --> 27:42.287
If I were you, I'd be
looking for a good lawyer.

27:42.371 --> 27:44.122
Sheriffs need lawyers, too.

27:45.958 --> 27:47.417
Not this one.

28:13.193 --> 28:15.028
I think I owe you
an apology.

28:16.196 --> 28:17.531
How you feeling?

28:19.199 --> 28:22.494
Nothing a six-month honeymoon
in the Bahamas couldn't cure.

28:22.619 --> 28:25.330
We'll see what we can do
about that. Here.

28:30.544 --> 28:31.628
Mary,

28:35.549 --> 28:37.342
is there anybody in town

28:38.427 --> 28:40.888
that you know that... that
might want to hurt you?

28:42.681 --> 28:44.308
Hurt, as in dead?

28:45.017 --> 28:46.143
Yeah.

28:48.020 --> 28:49.062
No.

28:51.982 --> 28:54.651
Two deacons are dead. I
don't want there to be three.

28:54.818 --> 28:56.278
Neither do I.

28:58.655 --> 28:59.781
You know,

29:01.200 --> 29:02.534
somehow,

29:02.993 --> 29:05.913
you seem more decisive,
more confident.

29:06.747 --> 29:10.584
Well, believe me, the last
thing I am is confident.

29:12.586 --> 29:17.049
You go back to sleep, okay, and, um,
I'll be back to check on you later.

29:17.132 --> 29:18.175
Promise?

29:19.009 --> 29:20.511
Cross my heart and hope

29:22.971 --> 29:24.223
to limbo.

29:24.932 --> 29:26.016
The Bahamas.

29:26.058 --> 29:27.392
Oh, goody.

29:39.196 --> 29:40.739
The rational mind
will tell you

29:40.823 --> 29:42.366
that things happen
for a reason,

29:42.407 --> 29:44.034
but so far,
I couldn't find one.

29:44.117 --> 29:46.912
And the scary thing was,
time was running out

29:46.995 --> 29:49.915
and I knew that somewhere out
there, a killer was coming.

29:49.957 --> 29:52.626
A killer,
perhaps with a badge.

30:15.232 --> 30:16.733
Where'd you come from?

30:17.234 --> 30:19.903
What, did you sneak in
while I was leaving the house?

30:37.629 --> 30:38.589
Hey!
Hey!

30:45.470 --> 30:47.139
Hey!
Mr. Rey.

30:47.764 --> 30:49.933
Hey! Mr. Rey,
a- are you all right?

30:50.517 --> 30:51.810
Yeah.

30:52.519 --> 30:54.479
Yeah, I think so.

30:54.563 --> 30:56.815
Oh, God, I'm sorry, Mr. Rey.

30:56.857 --> 31:00.652
I didn't mean to scare you. I... It's
just that my... my car broke down again

31:00.694 --> 31:05.407
and I... I was walking toward town
and I was trying to flag you down.

31:05.491 --> 31:07.159
I guess that you thought...

31:07.201 --> 31:08.827
I know.
Oh, I know. I know.

31:09.661 --> 31:11.163
It wasn't your fault, okay?

31:15.542 --> 31:17.711
I jerked the wheel
to avoid the goat.

31:19.171 --> 31:22.633
And then, when I saw you,

31:24.051 --> 31:27.179
I overreacted,
and the cat jumped

31:28.096 --> 31:29.223
in my face.

31:31.058 --> 31:32.351
And then,

31:33.644 --> 31:35.812
I tried to stay on the road,

31:36.647 --> 31:39.233
but the car, I don't know,

31:39.316 --> 31:43.153
it... it was just like in Christine,
it... it had a... a mind of its own,

31:43.278 --> 31:45.322
and I... I crashed.

31:46.198 --> 31:47.366
Christine?

31:47.533 --> 31:48.700
Never mind.

31:49.326 --> 31:51.453
Mr. Rey, I didn't...
I didn't see any goat.

31:52.955 --> 31:54.206
I saw a goat.

31:55.374 --> 31:58.710
It was the same goat I saw this
morning at the house, at my house!

31:58.877 --> 32:00.462
Mr. Rey, you don't have any cats.

32:00.546 --> 32:02.047
Stevie, this cat.

32:03.715 --> 32:04.842
My cat.

33:08.322 --> 33:09.907
666?

33:09.990 --> 33:11.575
Them that dance
with the Devil

33:11.617 --> 33:12.743
are bound to get scorched.

33:12.784 --> 33:13.994
Al!

33:14.536 --> 33:15.996
Well, next time, I'll knock.

33:16.079 --> 33:18.916
But all this stuff going on
around here has got me jumpy, too.

33:18.957 --> 33:20.334
Did Ziggy find anything?

33:20.417 --> 33:22.836
Zippo. He still thinks
you're here to save Mary.

33:23.545 --> 33:25.297
It's gotta be
the Sheriff, Al.

33:26.131 --> 33:28.967
He's the only one who could
have killed Tully and Dorothy.

33:29.009 --> 33:31.178
What, with a trained goat
and a snake?

33:31.261 --> 33:32.846
This is a sheriff,
not Ringling Bros.

33:32.930 --> 33:34.515
Nobody else
could have done it.

33:34.598 --> 33:36.141
Maybe the boogieman.

33:38.060 --> 33:42.564
Look, I found his matchstick
on the floor in the kitchen.

33:42.814 --> 33:45.943
Now, he had plenty of time when
he was taking Mary's statement

33:45.984 --> 33:48.237
to... to grab the snake
and then type the note.

33:48.320 --> 33:49.947
That doesn't
explain the goat.

33:50.072 --> 33:53.158
Well, I don't know how he did it, Al,
I just... I just know that he did it.

33:53.242 --> 33:54.576
Well, then
you've gotta find him

33:54.660 --> 33:56.286
and stop him,
no matter what it takes.

33:58.080 --> 33:59.206
Operator.

33:59.289 --> 34:01.500
Operator, uh, yeah, yeah,
uh, give me the Sheriff.

34:01.583 --> 34:02.584
It's an emergency.

34:02.668 --> 34:03.710
Moment, please.

34:03.794 --> 34:05.295
Coventry Sheriff's Department.

34:05.379 --> 34:07.756
Hello,
this is Joshua Rey.

34:07.840 --> 34:09.675
Uh, I need to talk
to the Sheriff, please.

34:09.716 --> 34:10.801
So do we.

34:10.884 --> 34:13.094
We've been looking for him
for half an hour ourselves.

34:14.304 --> 34:15.429
Operator.

34:15.514 --> 34:17.099
Yeah, operator,
get me the hospital.

34:17.181 --> 34:20.018
They can't find the Sheriff.
He's been gone for half an hour.

34:21.143 --> 34:22.771
Yes, Mary Greeley's room, please.

34:22.855 --> 34:24.773
I'm sorry,
she's already checked out.

34:24.857 --> 34:26.692
What? She's outside
waiting for the Sheriff.

34:26.775 --> 34:28.110
Well, don't let her
go with him.

34:28.193 --> 34:29.735
No, you tell her
I'll be right there.

34:29.820 --> 34:30.904
Jo-Joshua Rey.

34:30.987 --> 34:33.824
The Sheriff called. He's on
his way over to give her a lift.

34:33.907 --> 34:35.617
Gushie, center me
on Mary, now!

34:35.701 --> 34:37.327
I told you
it was the Sheriff!

34:54.011 --> 34:55.179
Sheriff!

34:56.889 --> 34:58.140
Sheriff!

35:07.107 --> 35:08.692
Sheriff?

35:15.741 --> 35:17.326
No!

35:50.776 --> 35:52.027
When I was growing up,

35:52.110 --> 35:54.363
Halloween was always
one of my favorite holidays.

35:55.364 --> 35:57.115
Trick or treat,
we used to say.

35:57.574 --> 36:00.035
Of course, back then,
we always expected a treat

36:00.118 --> 36:03.330
and if we did play a trick, it
was always funny and harmless.

36:05.123 --> 36:07.042
But tonight,
there were no treats.

36:07.918 --> 36:09.461
There were no tricks.

36:10.546 --> 36:11.964
There was only death.

36:13.882 --> 36:16.969
Stevie,
the Sheriff and Mary inside?

36:17.719 --> 36:19.471
Yeah, they just got here
a minute ago.

36:19.513 --> 36:20.806
Good.

36:22.266 --> 36:24.059
Good,
you can go home now.

36:24.309 --> 36:26.311
Hey, Mr. Rey, I got this idea for my book.

36:26.353 --> 36:28.897
It's about this...
I said, you can go home now.

36:29.064 --> 36:30.065
Oh.

36:30.941 --> 36:32.025
Okay.

36:33.193 --> 36:34.653
See you, Mr. Rey.

37:04.474 --> 37:05.601
Mary?

37:06.685 --> 37:08.520
Josh?

37:11.148 --> 37:12.149
Mary,

37:14.151 --> 37:15.319
Ben is dead.

37:15.527 --> 37:18.405
No, he isn't.
He's in the kitchen.

37:21.658 --> 37:22.868
Well,

37:26.705 --> 37:28.540
it's about time.

37:47.100 --> 37:48.519
Oh, my God!

37:52.272 --> 37:53.565
Mary, run!

38:06.703 --> 38:08.956
Advanced psychokinesis?

38:09.915 --> 38:11.083
Maybe.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.418
Maybe not.

38:16.380 --> 38:17.506
And Mary,

38:20.092 --> 38:21.635
she was never in danger.

38:25.389 --> 38:26.932
She is now.

38:29.351 --> 38:30.853
And Tully and the others?

38:31.937 --> 38:34.648
The fun part was
that it was a pattern

38:35.107 --> 38:37.985
that seemed to add up,
but it didn't.

38:38.277 --> 38:39.570
But it did.

38:41.071 --> 38:42.698
You quoted
Tully's line to me

38:42.781 --> 38:44.867
about "them who dance
with the Devil. "

38:44.950 --> 38:46.326
I never told you that.

38:47.327 --> 38:49.746
You never walked through
anything in this leap

38:49.997 --> 38:52.249
or used
the imaging chamber door.

38:52.791 --> 38:56.420
And when we were upstairs, and you
left to find Mary, you disappeared

38:56.503 --> 38:59.381
without using your handlink
to Ziggy. But most important,

38:59.464 --> 39:02.968
you were the only other person
around when Dorothy and Tully died.

39:03.385 --> 39:07.139
Personally, my favorite
part was watching your face

39:07.306 --> 39:10.100
when you read the messages
in the typewriter.

39:12.519 --> 39:14.104
That was priceless.

39:15.898 --> 39:18.942
You know how this story's
going to end, don't you?

39:19.151 --> 39:20.611
I know how you want it to.

39:20.736 --> 39:22.196
Yes, I believe you do.

39:24.156 --> 39:28.202
I'm sorry I'm late, but something
was goofing Ziggy up and...

39:31.163 --> 39:33.290
Oh, Sam,
this is not good.

39:33.749 --> 39:34.791
No, it isn't.

39:34.875 --> 39:37.920
Sam, uh, you, uh, you better
get out of here quick-quick.

39:39.379 --> 39:42.257
We can't, Al.
He's locked us in.

39:44.593 --> 39:47.596
He's already killed three
people, and he intends to kill us.

39:47.679 --> 39:49.723
Something long overdue.

39:51.099 --> 39:55.854
Sam, uh, Ziggy says that there's
definitely something there.

39:58.273 --> 40:00.818
That's more than I can
say for you.

40:00.859 --> 40:02.110
Who are you?

40:05.781 --> 40:07.866
Yin and yang,

40:08.408 --> 40:10.452
good and bad,

40:11.203 --> 40:12.412
God...

40:13.831 --> 40:15.499
The Devil.

40:15.624 --> 40:17.543
In the flesh, so to speak.

40:18.919 --> 40:20.337
This isn't possible.

40:20.379 --> 40:22.381
Come on, Al,
tell me he's not real.

40:25.551 --> 40:27.928
He's real, Sam,
he's very real.

40:28.011 --> 40:29.680
What is happening?

40:29.721 --> 40:31.223
Why are you doing this?

40:31.306 --> 40:32.933
To put an end
to your meddling.

40:34.393 --> 40:38.063
Who gave you the right
to go bungling around in time,

40:38.146 --> 40:40.440
putting right
what I made wrong?

40:40.983 --> 40:42.776
I'm just trying to get home.

40:42.901 --> 40:45.737
Well, you're not
going to make it!

40:51.535 --> 40:53.829
Sam, if you can touch him,
you can hurt him!

40:55.539 --> 40:58.000
Sam!
Sam!

41:15.142 --> 41:17.561
Hang in there, Sam,
hang in there!

41:54.640 --> 41:55.724
Sam!

42:03.190 --> 42:04.191
Sam!

42:06.735 --> 42:07.861
Josh!

42:11.824 --> 42:14.284
Josh! Josh, are you okay?

42:19.373 --> 42:21.166
Josh, what's the matter?

42:22.417 --> 42:24.294
No-No-Nothing.

42:25.128 --> 42:26.421
I'm fine.

42:28.048 --> 42:29.174
Sort of.

42:29.341 --> 42:31.802
Thank God,
you scared me for a minute.

42:32.261 --> 42:34.388
You had me scared, too, Sam.

42:34.596 --> 42:36.849
We completely lost you there
for a couple of minutes.

42:36.890 --> 42:38.350
What happened?

42:48.068 --> 42:50.904
For a while, there were...

42:51.613 --> 42:52.865
two of you

42:53.657 --> 42:55.826
and one of you
was trying to kill me.

42:56.827 --> 42:58.871
I was trying to kill you?
I was trying to kill you?

42:58.954 --> 43:00.706
Cool.
What a neat idea.

43:01.123 --> 43:05.210
You must've been dreaming.
Your name is, uh, Joshua Rey,

43:05.294 --> 43:07.337
you're a second-rate
horror novelist,

43:07.379 --> 43:09.756
and you're here
to save a person

43:09.840 --> 43:11.216
named Tully...

43:12.801 --> 43:13.927
Josh!

43:18.765 --> 43:19.975
Tully!

43:23.395 --> 43:24.354
Sam!

43:29.651 --> 43:32.654
Sam, this is incredible!

43:33.363 --> 43:35.532
You knew what to do
before I even told you.

43:36.366 --> 43:38.035
Thank you, Mr. Rey.

43:38.160 --> 43:39.870
You really saved my neck.

43:40.078 --> 43:42.873
Yeah, I guess
I did, didn't I?

43:42.915 --> 43:44.500
Glad you're okay.

43:46.001 --> 43:48.128
God, look at the time.
It's almost 12:15.

43:48.212 --> 43:49.338
I got to scram.

43:49.421 --> 43:52.382
I still gotta peel those
grapes for the bowl of eyeballs.

43:55.344 --> 43:57.179
Al, it was the goat...

43:59.765 --> 44:01.099
I don't see any goat.

44:06.563 --> 44:09.191
What else did I do
while you were unconscious?

44:09.316 --> 44:10.609
Uh,

44:11.068 --> 44:13.237
well, you got angry at me,

44:13.695 --> 44:15.656
and made a skull
fly across the room.

44:16.281 --> 44:19.034
It could have been worse. It
could have been kitchen knives.

44:19.117 --> 44:20.077
Wow! What a neat idea!

44:21.537 --> 44:22.496
Hi, Mrs. King!

44:22.579 --> 44:23.580
Hi, Mom!

44:28.293 --> 44:29.419
Stevie?

44:31.463 --> 44:32.548
King.

44:34.091 --> 44:35.384
Hey, Cujo!

44:42.474 --> 44:44.810
Kitchen knives?
Christine?

44:44.852 --> 44:46.478
Oh, my God,
I just gave him...

44:46.562 --> 44:47.688
What?

44:49.648 --> 44:51.108
Bye-bye, Sam.

45:06.540 --> 45:08.000
Open the window!

45:11.503 --> 45:15.090
I wish I could go with you, honey,
but your daddy would go crazy

45:15.174 --> 45:16.884
if I left him here
alone with the twins.

45:16.967 --> 45:18.844
I'm just so
danged proud of you.

45:19.261 --> 45:20.345
Oh!

45:20.554 --> 45:22.598
Wait. Oh, tarnation,
I almost forgot.

45:22.681 --> 45:24.725
Come get this stuff.
Open that door!

45:24.808 --> 45:25.976
Yoo-hoo!

45:26.351 --> 45:27.853
If you had forgotten this,

45:27.895 --> 45:29.688
you would look
pretty foolish.

45:32.357 --> 45:35.486
These are my favorite
ear baubles.

45:36.111 --> 45:37.905
It wouldn't do
for my baby girl

45:37.988 --> 45:40.782
to go off to the biggest
beauty contest in the South

45:40.866 --> 45:43.243
without her crown

45:43.327 --> 45:45.704
and her sash, now, would it?

45:48.874 --> 45:49.833
Oh!

45:50.918 --> 45:53.253
Oh, boy.
