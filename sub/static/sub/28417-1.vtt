00:00.431 --> 00:03.431
(film reel rolling)

00:07.845 --> 00:09.784
-  I'm
especially struck by the

00:09.793 --> 00:11.334
prince's advice to the players.

00:11.334 --> 00:13.742
If you'll indulge me, I'm just
gonna do a little excerpt...

00:13.742 --> 00:15.740
"For anything so overdone is from the

00:15.740 --> 00:17.712
purpose of playing whose end,

00:17.712 --> 00:20.030
both at the first and
now, was and is to hold

00:20.030 --> 00:22.270
as t'were the mirror up to nature.

00:22.270 --> 00:24.548
To show virtue for own feature, scorn

00:24.548 --> 00:26.900
her own image, and the very age and body

00:26.900 --> 00:29.380
of the time his form and pressure."

00:29.380 --> 00:31.530
Now I find this particularly
exciting as it's one

00:31.530 --> 00:33.720
of the first notable examples
of meta-theatricality.

00:33.720 --> 00:35.890
Now certainly we see this
more later in European

00:35.890 --> 00:37.880
theater of the 19th and 20th century.

00:37.880 --> 00:40.517
Artaud, Genet, Brecht, Beckett...

00:40.517 --> 00:42.309
But what's really interesting about--

00:42.309 --> 00:46.859
(tense, dramatic music)

01:10.177 --> 01:11.973
But there's something
about the accessibility

01:11.973 --> 01:14.250
and timelessness of the imagery here,

01:14.250 --> 01:15.934
particularly with the mirror.

01:15.934 --> 01:17.760
Profound in its simplicity.

01:17.760 --> 01:20.310
Now we're looking at a young
man. Essentially orphaned.

01:20.310 --> 01:22.580
Plagued by impulse and inaction trying

01:22.580 --> 01:25.920
to understand himself.
Deciding who he wants to be.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.400
He's trapped in this world of hypocrisy

01:28.400 --> 01:30.880
and performance in which
he, no matter what he does

01:30.880 --> 01:35.005
or doesn't do, is an
ill-fated participant.

01:35.005 --> 01:37.037
(beeping)
(gate opens)

01:37.037 --> 01:40.513
Though this be madness,
yet there is method in't.

01:45.206 --> 01:48.539
(dramatic, tense music)

02:20.068 --> 02:25.068
(insects buzzing)
(animals vocalizing)

02:26.520 --> 02:30.770
("Moonlight Sonata" plays in the distance)

03:29.230 --> 03:31.023
- I'm sure those are cold by now.

03:33.810 --> 03:35.940
There's a fresh tray in the oven,

03:35.940 --> 03:37.240
if you don't mind waiting.

03:42.750 --> 03:45.650
I did say any time after noon, didn't I?

03:49.310 --> 03:50.510
- Yeah, you did.

03:50.510 --> 03:52.660
You did, I uh, I was trying to get out--

03:52.660 --> 03:53.493
- Your teeth.

03:54.900 --> 03:55.733
-  What?

03:55.733 --> 03:58.007
- You have asparagus in your teeth.

03:58.007 --> 03:58.840
- Oh.

04:02.180 --> 04:03.520
Oh yeah.

04:03.520 --> 04:04.353
Yeah.

04:05.929 --> 04:06.762
It's a big one.

04:08.690 --> 04:10.170
Right, sorry I'm a little late.

04:10.170 --> 04:12.190
I had to pick up a shift this morning.

04:12.190 --> 04:13.490
- You didn't call.

04:13.490 --> 04:15.040
- Don't have your number.

04:15.040 --> 04:17.223
And my phone is dead anyway, so.

04:18.560 --> 04:19.660
Do you have a charger?

04:20.940 --> 04:22.940
- First drawer on your right.

04:22.940 --> 04:23.773
- Thanks.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.900
They didn't include one
with the rental car.

04:30.950 --> 04:31.833
Sometimes they...

04:33.160 --> 04:33.993
they do.

04:37.330 --> 04:40.010
Thanks for setting that
whole thing up by the way.

04:40.010 --> 04:40.843
- My pleasure.

04:43.910 --> 04:45.713
- It's a really beautiful property.

04:46.853 --> 04:49.270
- I'm very fortunate.

04:49.270 --> 04:51.290
-  How long have you been up here?

04:51.290 --> 04:53.210
- For four years.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.253
Before that it was a lot of traveling.

04:56.210 --> 04:59.030
Paris. Ecuador for a long time.

04:59.030 --> 04:59.863
- Wow.

04:59.863 --> 05:00.696
-  Hong Kong.

05:00.696 --> 05:01.620
- That must have been amazing.

05:02.550 --> 05:03.823
- It paid for the house.

05:05.490 --> 05:07.940
- What exactly do you do for--
- Right.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.873
I realize we haven't
been properly introduced.

05:15.900 --> 05:16.733
Richard.

05:16.733 --> 05:17.566
- Seth.

05:22.187 --> 05:24.937
- It's good to meet you, brother.

05:28.230 --> 05:29.063
- Yeah.

05:30.260 --> 05:31.470
Yeah, Richard, I gotta say man,

05:31.470 --> 05:34.623
I was, I was a little
surprised to get your letter.

05:35.820 --> 05:37.530
- I thought you might be.

05:37.530 --> 05:40.242
-  Last week I didn't
even know you existed.

05:40.242 --> 05:42.773
- Well, that's the thing
about wealth, Seth.

05:44.221 --> 05:47.083
It can be a cloak if you
choose to use it that way.

05:48.610 --> 05:51.400
But I figured it was high time we met.

05:51.400 --> 05:55.360
Call it a belated graduation party.

05:55.360 --> 05:57.690
- I graduated like two years ago.

05:57.690 --> 05:58.723
- I said belated.

06:00.410 --> 06:02.903
Besides, you only just
got a permanent address.

06:03.850 --> 06:05.760
When I send a letter, I
need to know it's going

06:05.760 --> 06:06.883
to be received.

06:09.650 --> 06:11.400
- How long have you known about me?

06:14.140 --> 06:14.973
- Seth.

06:17.640 --> 06:19.590
I've been watching you your whole life.

06:20.620 --> 06:21.453
- What?

06:21.453 --> 06:25.940
- Not all the time, on
and off, from a distance.

06:25.940 --> 06:29.083
It's kinda creepy what
you can find online.

06:30.851 --> 06:32.134
(chuckles)

06:33.950 --> 06:35.750
Sorry about your mother, by the way.

06:37.172 --> 06:38.650
- You knew about my mom?

06:38.650 --> 06:39.493
- Yes, I did.

06:42.330 --> 06:43.983
- Well why didn't you do anything?

06:45.560 --> 06:47.810
- I didn't think it was
my place to intercede.

06:47.810 --> 06:50.240
- She was dying.
(water running)

06:50.240 --> 06:53.683
- Yes she was.
(water running)

06:56.940 --> 07:00.550
Look Seth, you just met me and, uh,

07:02.080 --> 07:04.223
I hope this doesn't sound callous, but,

07:05.430 --> 07:07.463
your mom was dying. Not mine.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.130
- Did you build this house?

07:16.130 --> 07:18.159
- Me and 74 Mexicans.

07:18.159 --> 07:20.230
(Seth chuckles)

07:20.230 --> 07:21.480
Yeah.

07:21.480 --> 07:23.720
Yeah, it was a big project.

07:23.720 --> 07:24.553
- Yeah.

07:26.400 --> 07:27.233
How big is it?

07:29.140 --> 07:30.073
- Huge.

07:31.593 --> 07:33.190
(chuckles)
Seriously.

07:33.190 --> 07:38.080
14,124 square feet on 17 acres.

07:38.080 --> 07:40.161
- That sounds like a lot
of house for one dude.

07:40.161 --> 07:42.263
(Richard chuckles)
- A'int that the truth.

07:47.830 --> 07:48.720
You want?

07:48.720 --> 07:50.637
- Um, no, I'm okay, thank you.

07:56.210 --> 07:57.123
- You don't drink?

07:58.460 --> 08:01.803
- I'm just good right now.
(fridge closes)

08:03.760 --> 08:05.760
- Did you bring the NDA?

08:05.760 --> 08:06.760
- Oh.

08:06.760 --> 08:07.593
Uh yeah.

08:10.230 --> 08:11.190
Uh...

08:14.090 --> 08:17.690
I actually wasn't totally
sure what to make of it.

08:17.690 --> 08:18.523
- Really?

08:19.405 --> 08:20.905
The language is very standard.

08:22.140 --> 08:25.393
- No, I mean, I, just don't
really know why you need it.

08:27.780 --> 08:29.770
- I value my privacy.

08:29.770 --> 08:30.730
- Sure.

08:30.730 --> 08:32.763
Yeah, no, I respect that.

08:34.250 --> 08:37.230
- And now, legally...

08:39.670 --> 08:40.503
You must.

08:43.470 --> 08:46.250
Oh, here, before I forget.

08:46.250 --> 08:47.083
WiFi.

08:48.220 --> 08:50.370
Wouldn't wanna miss
one of your blog posts.

08:51.390 --> 08:52.930
- You know about that too, huh?

08:52.930 --> 08:54.180
- It's like I said, Seth,

08:55.110 --> 08:57.033
the internet's a creepy place.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.233
Now, you look exhausted.

09:03.080 --> 09:05.460
Why don't you go upstairs
and pick out your bedroom

09:05.460 --> 09:07.000
and I'll let you know when dinner's ready.

09:07.000 --> 09:07.833
- Cool.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.150
Uh, did you just say pick out my bedroom?

09:13.150 --> 09:14.103
- Any one you like.

09:15.754 --> 09:18.610
(chuckles)

09:18.610 --> 09:19.443
- Cool.

09:19.443 --> 09:20.276
Thank you.

09:22.430 --> 09:23.263
- Seth.

09:25.650 --> 09:26.608
Welcome home.

09:29.586 --> 09:31.836
(chuckles)

09:31.962 --> 09:33.187
I'm gonna...

09:37.480 --> 09:40.397
(slow, soft music)

09:59.049 --> 10:03.716
(laughing)
(soft music)

10:08.103 --> 10:13.103
(water running)
(soft music)

11:00.958 --> 11:03.460
(soft music)

11:03.460 --> 11:04.410
- You must be Seth.

11:06.090 --> 11:07.000
- Shit.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.200
Yeah, sorry, I didn't mean
to walk in on you, or, or--

11:10.200 --> 11:11.450
- It's fine.

11:11.450 --> 11:12.283
I'm Abby.

11:13.420 --> 11:14.680
- I'm Seth.
(Abby laughs)

11:14.680 --> 11:16.360
I'm sorry if I scared you.

11:16.360 --> 11:18.220
I was just wandering around,
I thought they were all empty.

11:18.220 --> 11:19.260
Richard didn't mention you so I--

11:19.260 --> 11:20.743
- Do you wanna hand me that towel?

11:25.700 --> 11:26.533
Thanks.

11:28.140 --> 11:29.700
You look like him.

11:29.700 --> 11:30.810
-  Who?

11:30.810 --> 11:32.200
- Your brother.

11:32.200 --> 11:33.580
- Oh, duh.

11:33.580 --> 11:34.885
-  Turn around.

11:34.885 --> 11:35.718
- What?

11:35.718 --> 11:36.551
- Go on.

11:36.551 --> 11:37.384
-  I should probably actually--

11:37.384 --> 11:38.467
- Just do it.

11:39.615 --> 11:41.698
(laughs)

11:42.550 --> 11:43.540
Uh huh.

11:43.540 --> 11:44.373
There.

11:45.640 --> 11:46.950
It's the eyes.

11:46.950 --> 11:47.783
- Yeah?

11:47.783 --> 11:50.160
Not in my giant biceps?

11:50.160 --> 11:51.330
- Well you're still wearing your jacket,

11:51.330 --> 11:54.813
I haven't seen those
yet, so I wouldn't know.

11:54.813 --> 11:55.646
(chuckling)

11:55.646 --> 11:58.283
This is totally how
every 90s porno starts.

11:59.478 --> 12:00.610
(laughing)

12:00.610 --> 12:02.240
- I should really get out of here before

12:02.240 --> 12:03.230
my brother shows up.

12:03.230 --> 12:06.773
- And that would totally
be the next line too.

12:07.880 --> 12:10.600
- Yeah, and then it hits
you with the subscription

12:10.600 --> 12:11.433
screen, right?

12:11.433 --> 12:13.400
Five dollars for one day of access.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.750
- That's why I pay monthly.

12:15.900 --> 12:16.950
- That's very frugal.

12:18.088 --> 12:20.755
(Abby chuckles)

12:22.440 --> 12:23.982
So I think I should probably--

12:23.982 --> 12:24.815
- Go?

12:24.815 --> 12:25.648
- Go, yeah.

12:27.170 --> 12:28.131
I'm Seth, by the way.

12:28.131 --> 12:28.981
- I know.

12:28.981 --> 12:30.062
- Right.

12:30.062 --> 12:34.360
I already told you.
(Abby chuckles)

12:34.360 --> 12:35.870
Okay.

12:35.870 --> 12:37.510
I'll see you at dinner?

12:37.510 --> 12:38.343
- Highly likely.

12:39.556 --> 12:42.640
(Abby laughs)

12:42.640 --> 12:43.473
- Um.

12:44.550 --> 12:47.150
You know Richard better than I do.

12:47.150 --> 12:48.640
Would he think that this is funny, or?

12:48.640 --> 12:49.473
- Maybe.

12:50.530 --> 12:52.250
Probably best to keep
it to ourselves, though.

12:52.250 --> 12:53.400
It's more fun that way.

12:54.540 --> 12:55.373
- Okay.

12:56.660 --> 12:57.493
Bye.

13:07.329 --> 13:10.412
(upbeat funky music)

13:17.710 --> 13:19.290
- Find everything you need?

13:19.290 --> 13:20.123
- Yeah.

13:22.140 --> 13:23.490
- So you like what you saw?

13:24.680 --> 13:26.723
- Um, yeah, yeah, it's beautiful.

13:27.760 --> 13:28.790
- Great.

13:28.790 --> 13:30.140
Why don't you follow me?

13:30.140 --> 13:31.703
There's something I'd like to show you.

13:36.536 --> 13:39.703
♪ I gave you my heart ♪

13:41.720 --> 13:42.633
- Whoa.

13:43.600 --> 13:46.110
This is--
- It's nice, all right?

13:46.110 --> 13:46.943
It's nice.

13:49.131 --> 13:52.464
(music in the distance)

13:57.590 --> 13:58.970
This is it.

13:58.970 --> 13:59.803
- What?

14:01.510 --> 14:03.950
- That's you, and that's me, brother bear.

14:03.950 --> 14:04.783
- We met?

14:05.960 --> 14:06.930
- Barely.

14:06.930 --> 14:09.840
You were still suckling
your mom's tit, but,

14:09.840 --> 14:11.350
yeah we sort of did.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.573
Just once, 23 years ago.

14:14.570 --> 14:16.253
Just about to the day, actually.

14:18.270 --> 14:20.600
First day of freshman year at Fairfax.

14:20.600 --> 14:21.433
- That's Dad?

14:22.560 --> 14:24.304
- That's him.
(Seth chuckles)

14:24.304 --> 14:25.304
- He looks so young.

14:26.260 --> 14:27.093
- And he was.

14:31.761 --> 14:35.080
You know, that's the
last time I ever saw him.

14:35.080 --> 14:36.380
- What happened?

14:36.380 --> 14:38.740
- He made his impression
on the other legacies,

14:38.740 --> 14:43.413
wrote me a check for the
next four years, and left.

14:44.630 --> 14:46.850
- Geez, Richard, I'm sorry.

14:46.850 --> 14:51.850
- He saw his paternal
duties through to completion

14:52.070 --> 14:52.983
that afternoon.

14:54.736 --> 14:57.224
- That was it?

14:57.224 --> 14:58.190
- That was it.

14:58.190 --> 14:59.023
- Why?

15:00.600 --> 15:01.433
- He had you.

15:02.530 --> 15:04.530
Once my mother died, our little nuclear

15:04.530 --> 15:06.463
family was broken, so...

15:08.210 --> 15:09.423
on to the next.

15:10.530 --> 15:13.040
- I guess there's a lot that I don't know.

15:13.040 --> 15:13.873
- Not really.

15:14.950 --> 15:18.283
Dad left, married your mom and had you.

15:19.510 --> 15:21.800
Lost all his money in a pyramid scheme

15:21.800 --> 15:23.703
and put a pistol in his mouth.

15:24.810 --> 15:28.853
Your mom got sick and
died and now, you're here.

15:30.520 --> 15:31.618
With me.

15:31.618 --> 15:32.451
(bell rings)

15:32.451 --> 15:33.284
Dinner's ready.

15:40.445 --> 15:43.740
(soft, funky music)

15:43.740 --> 15:45.523
Seth, this is Abby.

15:46.930 --> 15:49.930
(soft, funky music)

15:53.240 --> 15:55.110
- Pleasure to meet you, Seth.

15:55.110 --> 15:55.943
- Richard.

15:55.943 --> 15:58.250
You didn't tell me that we had a sister.

15:58.250 --> 15:59.815
- She better not be my sister,

15:59.815 --> 16:02.065
what with all the dirty
shit I've done to her.

16:03.600 --> 16:04.433
Let's eat.

16:09.890 --> 16:11.207
- You'll get used to him.

16:18.580 --> 16:21.060
- It's like um, a lifestyle thing.

16:21.060 --> 16:23.640
I guess it's a brand, although,

16:23.640 --> 16:25.620
that sounds really pretentious.

16:25.620 --> 16:28.270
It's embryonic, but it has a heartbeat.

16:28.270 --> 16:29.240
- What's it called?

16:29.240 --> 16:30.710
- Blink.

16:30.710 --> 16:33.980
It's like, um, current
events, a lot of politics.

16:33.980 --> 16:36.420
Kind of how it all shapes
these cognitive biases

16:36.420 --> 16:38.370
in our society.
- Totally.

16:38.370 --> 16:40.100
- Who's your audience?

16:40.100 --> 16:41.470
Ironic hipsters?

16:41.470 --> 16:43.500
Social justice warriors?

16:43.500 --> 16:45.100
Millennials?

16:45.100 --> 16:46.539
- Yeah.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.389
- I think it sounds really promising.

16:49.540 --> 16:51.741
- I think you should change the name.

16:51.742 --> 16:53.037
- Why?

16:53.387 --> 16:54.510
- Why?

16:54.510 --> 16:55.343
Blink?

16:56.666 --> 16:59.280
It sounds like you're
saying your eyes are closed.

16:59.280 --> 17:01.500
- You know it's like, giving
you more clarity almost.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.250
You know, blinking is rejuvenating.

17:06.077 --> 17:06.910
- Blink.

17:08.003 --> 17:09.290
Blink.

17:09.290 --> 17:10.373
Nope, no.

17:11.480 --> 17:12.313
Sorry.

17:13.280 --> 17:14.123
I don't like it.

17:15.782 --> 17:16.632
You makin' money?

17:17.720 --> 17:19.560
- Like I said, it's embryonic--

17:19.560 --> 17:22.240
- Okay, so no.

17:22.240 --> 17:23.470
- Well I think it has potential.

17:23.470 --> 17:25.020
- So does a box of nails.

17:25.020 --> 17:27.160
What's your timeline?
- I don't know.

17:27.160 --> 17:28.700
- What do you mean you don't know?

17:28.700 --> 17:30.030
You don't have a plan?

17:30.030 --> 17:31.280
- Yeah, I do have a plan.

17:33.240 --> 17:34.073
- So?

17:34.920 --> 17:35.753
- I just...

17:37.000 --> 17:40.190
- The IP seems pretty weak
if you ask me. I mean,

17:40.190 --> 17:42.460
right off the top of
my head I can think of

17:42.460 --> 17:45.960
a dozen other pop psych
websites that are trying

17:45.960 --> 17:48.130
to do the exact same
thing you're trying to do.

17:48.130 --> 17:49.780
What do you have that's proprietary?

17:49.780 --> 17:50.720
- Proprietary?

17:50.720 --> 17:52.285
- Proprietary means original.

17:52.285 --> 17:53.642
- Exclusive--
- Yeah, Richard. I know

17:53.642 --> 17:54.984
what it means. I--
- So?

17:54.993 --> 17:55.972
What's the answer?

17:55.972 --> 17:57.460
What makes your business unique?

17:57.460 --> 17:59.220
- I wouldn't even call this a business.

17:59.220 --> 18:00.390
- Baby--
- See.

18:00.390 --> 18:02.153
There's your problem right there.

18:03.370 --> 18:05.290
How's it ever gonna be
a real business unless

18:05.290 --> 18:07.464
you start treating it like
one? You're the founder.

18:07.464 --> 18:08.482
- That's not what I meant, I mean--

18:08.482 --> 18:09.315
- Baby.

18:10.358 --> 18:12.010
Come on.

18:12.010 --> 18:13.500
- What about financial projections?

18:13.500 --> 18:15.603
- It's a start up.
- So was Apple.

18:16.490 --> 18:17.570
Buzzfeed.

18:17.570 --> 18:18.730
Netflix.

18:18.730 --> 18:20.540
You think any of them
took their first shit

18:20.540 --> 18:22.573
without a basic financial plan?

18:23.410 --> 18:25.750
Honey, do you wanna put
that Pinot in a sippy cup

18:25.750 --> 18:27.960
'cause we're having dinner
with a five-year-old?

18:27.960 --> 18:29.530
- Richard, did you just
bring me up so you could

18:29.530 --> 18:30.363
bust my balls?

18:30.363 --> 18:32.053
- Ooh, tough guy.
- Richard.

18:34.659 --> 18:36.059
Just let him eat his dinner.

18:38.060 --> 18:39.383
- I'm trying to help him.

18:39.383 --> 18:40.688
- Yeah.

18:40.688 --> 18:41.938
Well. You're not. So...

18:45.050 --> 18:46.810
- You know what?

18:46.810 --> 18:48.200
Baby, you're right.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.033
Seth,

18:50.340 --> 18:51.820
I apologize.

18:51.820 --> 18:53.020
I just...

18:54.880 --> 18:56.370
I have strong opinions.

18:56.370 --> 18:57.203
- It's fine.

18:59.890 --> 19:00.973
- Gesundheit.

19:01.988 --> 19:04.905
(soft piano music)

19:07.340 --> 19:08.173
- What?

19:08.173 --> 19:09.820
- You sneezed.

19:09.820 --> 19:11.320
- No I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.

19:11.320 --> 19:12.477
You sneezed.
- No I didn't.

19:12.477 --> 19:14.010
- You sounded like a fuckin' rhinoceros.

19:14.010 --> 19:14.910
I know it wasn't Abby.

19:14.910 --> 19:17.460
She doesn't sound like
that, even when she's, uh...

19:18.620 --> 19:19.453
- Okay.

19:20.869 --> 19:23.786
(soft piano music)

19:25.550 --> 19:26.870
- All right, I'm messin' with you.

19:26.870 --> 19:28.380
Come on.

19:28.380 --> 19:29.700
Come on, just--
- What?

19:29.700 --> 19:31.170
- Relax, all right?

19:31.170 --> 19:33.513
Just, just relax.

19:34.510 --> 19:36.994
Try blinking, it'll rejuvenate you.

19:36.994 --> 19:37.935
(Abby chuckles)

19:37.935 --> 19:38.890
Finish that soup.

19:38.890 --> 19:41.710
Those Alba truffles just got
flown first class from Italy.

19:41.710 --> 19:44.760
They cost more than you made
last year. Before taxes.

19:44.760 --> 19:46.066
- They're actually my
favorite, you should--

19:46.066 --> 19:46.899
- You know what, I'm fine.

19:46.899 --> 19:48.160
I'm not hungry right now.

19:48.160 --> 19:49.915
- Come on.

19:49.915 --> 19:51.907
A strapping young innovator like you?

19:51.907 --> 19:53.900
- I'm not young, Richard. I'm almost 25.

19:53.900 --> 19:55.450
- What, did you blow snot
in there when you sneezed?

19:55.450 --> 19:56.820
- I didn't fuckin', I didn't sneeze.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.990
- Walked right into it again.

19:58.990 --> 19:59.998
Huh?

20:02.580 --> 20:03.870
Well this was great.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.490
This was, uh, very...

20:08.120 --> 20:09.149
rejuvenating.

20:13.870 --> 20:14.933
Dessert's out back.

20:17.165 --> 20:17.998
Blink.

20:19.440 --> 20:22.357
(soft piano music)

20:24.640 --> 20:26.140
- You really do look like him.

20:27.930 --> 20:29.640
- Whatever, as long as I
don't have his sense of humor.

20:29.640 --> 20:31.340
- He does that sometimes.

20:31.340 --> 20:33.260
- He acts like there's
voices in his head sometimes?

20:33.260 --> 20:34.253
That's hilarious.

20:36.175 --> 20:38.725
- You'll get used to the--
- I'll get used to him?

20:40.730 --> 20:41.917
- Yeah.

20:41.917 --> 20:43.000
(Seth scoffs)

20:43.000 --> 20:45.183
He just wants you to be comfortable here.

20:46.537 --> 20:47.900
We both do.

20:47.900 --> 20:50.470
- Well so far he's getting a D-minus,

20:50.470 --> 20:52.170
and that's only because
these Alba truffles,

20:52.170 --> 20:53.896
oh they're so expensive
they cost more than I made

20:53.896 --> 20:55.867
last year before taxes.

20:55.867 --> 20:58.590
- He can be a little
rough around the edges.

20:58.590 --> 20:59.829
- Yeah, no shit.

20:59.829 --> 21:01.028
Sorry.

21:03.121 --> 21:04.856
- He loves you.

21:04.856 --> 21:06.083
- He loves me?

21:06.083 --> 21:08.170
He doesn't know me.

21:08.170 --> 21:09.393
- Doesn't have to.

21:11.560 --> 21:12.733
You're his brother.

21:15.429 --> 21:19.370
And look, if you're ever
having a hard time getting

21:19.370 --> 21:22.037
a read on him, you can always come to me.

21:22.037 --> 21:22.870
Any time.

21:24.580 --> 21:25.660
For anything.

21:25.660 --> 21:26.726
- Thanks.

21:28.540 --> 21:30.700
Except maybe not when
you're in the shower, right?

21:30.700 --> 21:34.043
-  Hey, if the door's open.

21:37.603 --> 21:40.020
(door opens)

21:41.079 --> 21:42.791
(door closes)

21:42.791 --> 21:44.020
(insects buzzing)

21:44.020 --> 21:45.100
- Seth.

21:45.100 --> 21:47.200
Give you 100 bucks if you
swallow this right now.

21:47.200 --> 21:48.840
- Oh no thanks.

21:48.840 --> 21:51.530
Add a couple zeros, I'll think about it.

21:51.530 --> 21:52.410
- Too late.

21:52.410 --> 21:54.495
I like your style, though.

21:54.495 --> 21:55.890
- Sure I can't you one?

21:55.890 --> 21:57.974
- Oh no, I'm okay, thank you.

21:57.974 --> 21:58.916
- You sure?

21:58.916 --> 22:01.410
Richard's a lot more fun
when you're not sober.

22:01.410 --> 22:02.580
- I bet.

22:02.580 --> 22:04.841
I don't really drink for fun.

22:04.841 --> 22:06.110
- All right.

22:06.110 --> 22:08.373
Well, let me know if you change your mind.

22:10.200 --> 22:13.902
So, tell me about your website.

22:13.902 --> 22:16.090
- Uh, I don't really wanna
talk about that anymore.

22:16.090 --> 22:19.013
- Oh come on, it's just me.

22:19.013 --> 22:22.600
- It's going really slow,
like I was saying, but,

22:22.600 --> 22:23.570
you know, it's just me, I'm trying to get

22:23.570 --> 22:24.520
up all this content--

22:24.520 --> 22:26.220
- You should get a model.

22:26.220 --> 22:28.368
Put her in a t-shirt, right
there on the homepage.

22:28.368 --> 22:30.950
- Well the brand is kind of academic.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.767
- It doesn't matter,
it's universal clickbait.

22:32.767 --> 22:34.770
- Well I also don't have any equipment

22:34.770 --> 22:36.140
or studio space and that stuff--

22:36.140 --> 22:37.270
- Richard has those.

22:37.270 --> 22:38.103
- Of course he does.

22:38.103 --> 22:40.340
- He gets a new camera
every year for his birthday,

22:40.340 --> 22:42.840
so if you don't mind
shooting yourself, I mean...

22:42.840 --> 22:43.923
- What about a model?

22:43.923 --> 22:44.956
- Seth.

22:45.810 --> 22:47.033
Let's play Chubby Bunny.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.290
- What?
- No, no, no, no, no.

22:49.290 --> 22:50.500
Let's do it.

22:50.500 --> 22:53.060
I always beat Abby, it's
completely unfair 'cause she

22:53.060 --> 22:54.710
has such a tiny mouth.

22:54.710 --> 22:57.270
You might actually
present some competition.

22:57.270 --> 22:58.900
- Are you serious?

22:58.900 --> 23:01.210
- Uh, 100 bucks if you beat me.

23:01.210 --> 23:02.510
- Richard, I don't really like to bet--

23:02.510 --> 23:04.230
- Thousand bucks.

23:04.230 --> 23:05.288
No shit.

23:06.970 --> 23:08.003
- Oh, okay.

23:08.840 --> 23:11.680
Yeah, okay, for... Yeah, I'll play.

23:11.680 --> 23:13.120
- Excellent.

23:13.120 --> 23:16.320
All right, the rules call for
two marshmallows at a time.

23:16.320 --> 23:18.250
Yes, you can position with your fingers>

23:18.250 --> 23:20.260
No, you can't chew or shallow.

23:20.260 --> 23:21.740
If you do, you lose.

23:21.740 --> 23:23.860
If a marshmallows pops out of your mouth,

23:23.860 --> 23:25.090
you also lose.

23:25.090 --> 23:26.900
If the words Chubby Bunny are not both

23:26.900 --> 23:28.550
audible and clear--

23:28.550 --> 23:29.730
- I lose.
- You lose.

23:29.730 --> 23:31.180
Abby's officiating.

23:31.180 --> 23:32.460
Any questions?

23:32.460 --> 23:36.053
- Uh yeah. I have--
- Let's play Chubby Bunny.

23:36.053 --> 23:37.371
(dramatic music)

23:37.371 --> 23:40.430
(Abby laughs)
- Oh my god, are you?

23:40.430 --> 23:43.516
Okay. Uh, yeah. Alright, let's go.

23:43.516 --> 23:44.483
- You scared?

23:44.483 --> 23:45.416
- No.

23:45.416 --> 23:46.890
Let's play.

23:46.890 --> 23:49.640
(dramatic music)

23:54.580 --> 23:55.413
Chubby Bunny.

23:56.710 --> 23:57.850
- Okay.

23:57.850 --> 23:58.683
Okay.

24:00.280 --> 24:02.240
You didn't embarrass yourself.

24:02.240 --> 24:03.840
That's not what I was expecting.

24:07.587 --> 24:10.337
(dramatic music)

24:13.510 --> 24:14.383
Chubby Bunny.

24:17.574 --> 24:20.324
(dramatic music)

24:25.230 --> 24:26.143
- Chubby Bunny.

24:27.017 --> 24:28.350
- Both still in.

24:29.330 --> 24:32.080
(dramatic music)

24:38.451 --> 24:39.701
- Chubby Bunny.

24:40.905 --> 24:43.655
(dramatic music)

25:02.378 --> 25:03.628
- Chubby Bunny.

25:05.385 --> 25:06.954
- Your move, babe.

25:06.954 --> 25:09.707
- Alright, fuck it.

25:09.707 --> 25:12.457
(dramatic music)

25:16.401 --> 25:18.068
Chubby Bunny, bitch.

25:19.267 --> 25:22.017
(dramatic music)

25:27.122 --> 25:28.289
What the fuck?

25:29.875 --> 25:32.675
- Chubby Bunny!

25:33.315 --> 25:36.065
(dramatic music)

25:44.861 --> 25:47.107
(mumbling)

25:47.107 --> 25:49.053
(groans)

25:49.053 --> 25:50.970
- Looks like Seth wins.

25:52.384 --> 25:53.217
- Fuck!

25:54.700 --> 25:56.050
Well played brother.

25:56.050 --> 25:57.360
You psyched me out.

25:57.360 --> 25:58.730
Very impressive.

25:58.730 --> 26:00.830
Who would've thought
you would be so adroit

26:00.830 --> 26:02.218
at Corpulent Hare.

26:02.218 --> 26:04.706
I'm very impressed. You psyched me out.

26:04.706 --> 26:06.480
I didn't think it was possible,

26:06.480 --> 26:07.823
least of all from you.

26:09.310 --> 26:11.320
But you did it. You won.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.160
I'm going to bed.

26:12.160 --> 26:13.477
I'm a loser--
- Not a lo--

26:13.477 --> 26:17.090
- I'm going to bed, no,
I know I am, I know I am.

26:17.090 --> 26:18.759
See you later?

26:18.759 --> 26:19.592
(kisses)

26:19.592 --> 26:20.750
And...
(kisses)

26:20.750 --> 26:23.363
Seth, until tomorrow...

26:24.520 --> 26:26.213
when the adventures continue.

26:27.600 --> 26:28.608
- Can't wait.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.283
- Congratulations, champ.

26:32.775 --> 26:35.798
(door closes)

26:35.798 --> 26:38.631
(insects buzzing)

26:43.058 --> 26:44.166
- Gross.

26:45.311 --> 26:47.394
(typing)

26:49.398 --> 26:51.148
Fuck you, Richard...

26:53.662 --> 26:56.480
(computer shuts down)

26:56.480 --> 26:58.647
(tapping)

27:10.856 --> 27:15.273
(ghostly moans)
(grunting)

27:18.687 --> 27:23.687
(moaning)
(soft, dramatic music)

27:32.633 --> 27:34.401
-  Oh yeah, baby.

27:34.401 --> 27:37.401
Oh my, give it to me! Give it to me!

27:38.482 --> 27:43.399
(loud, dramatic music)
(moaning)

27:46.964 --> 27:50.105
(moaning continues)

27:53.075 --> 27:58.075
(aggressive groaning)

28:00.847 --> 28:03.597
(dramatic music)

28:03.766 --> 28:06.007
(heavy breathing)

28:06.190 --> 28:08.857
(water running)

28:14.586 --> 28:17.336
(dramatic music)

28:24.273 --> 28:27.190
(bottles clacking)

28:34.881 --> 28:37.056
(Abby sighs)

28:37.078 --> 28:39.303
(footsteps away)

28:40.273 --> 28:41.369
-  Fuck.

28:42.461 --> 28:44.961
(Seth groans)

28:55.879 --> 28:57.962
(groans)

28:59.683 --> 29:02.183
(Seth sniffs)

29:16.669 --> 29:17.830
Mmm.

29:17.830 --> 29:19.410
- If you're not happy
with the continental,

29:19.410 --> 29:20.860
I can make you something hot.

29:24.793 --> 29:25.880
- This is perfect, thanks.

29:25.880 --> 29:27.020
- Okay.

29:27.020 --> 29:27.870
Just let me know.

29:35.850 --> 29:40.433
You know it's not healthy to
eat while standing, right?

29:47.140 --> 29:48.470
You sleep okay?

29:48.470 --> 29:50.763
- Um, yeah, kind of.

29:50.763 --> 29:52.590
- Hey, I totally get it.

29:52.590 --> 29:55.240
The first night I stayed
here, I barely slept a wink.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.478
Before I forget.

29:59.615 --> 30:00.781
- What's this?

30:02.760 --> 30:04.170
Is he serious?

30:04.170 --> 30:05.650
-  Of course he is.

30:05.650 --> 30:06.790
- This was a joke.

30:06.790 --> 30:09.240
- Richard never jokes about money.

30:09.240 --> 30:10.600
- Well, I mean this is super generous,

30:10.600 --> 30:11.850
but I can't accept that--

30:12.900 --> 30:14.000
- You have to.

30:14.930 --> 30:16.580
Deal's a deal.

30:16.580 --> 30:18.080
Signed, sealed, and delivered.

30:19.233 --> 30:20.990
- A thousand dollars is a lot of money.

30:20.990 --> 30:22.023
- Seth.

30:24.090 --> 30:25.453
I think he can afford it.

30:30.050 --> 30:32.253
- I should at least
find him. Say thank you.

30:32.253 --> 30:34.100
- I would advise against that.

30:34.100 --> 30:36.850
Better to just accept the
gift. He prefers it that way.

30:45.344 --> 30:46.600
- What are you working on?

30:46.600 --> 30:49.512
- Shopping, emails, a
little bit of coding.

30:49.512 --> 30:50.503
- Coding?

30:50.503 --> 30:51.720
- Working on a few security bugs on my

30:51.720 --> 30:52.920
company's new interface.
(phone buzzes)

30:52.920 --> 30:54.670
-  Oh you have a company?

30:54.670 --> 30:55.630
What do you guys--

30:55.630 --> 30:57.313
Oh.
- Give me a sec.

30:57.313 --> 31:00.936
One sec.

31:00.936 --> 31:04.853
(speaking in French)

31:14.862 --> 31:19.287
(continues speaking in French)

31:30.918 --> 31:32.400
- So what do you do?

31:32.400 --> 31:35.310
- It's kind of hard to explain.

31:35.310 --> 31:38.458
Tech start up is my go-to
cocktail party explanation.

31:38.458 --> 31:39.582
- Start up, that's cool.

31:39.582 --> 31:40.607
What is it?

31:40.607 --> 31:43.250
- We cater to an eclectic
mix of wealthy clientele.

31:43.250 --> 31:46.413
It's very project specific, but...

31:47.360 --> 31:49.173
That's really the best way I can put it.

31:50.556 --> 31:52.970
Are you gonna finish all that fruit?

31:52.970 --> 31:54.620
- Oh.

31:54.620 --> 31:56.250
No, probably not.
(laughing)

31:56.250 --> 31:57.083
I uh...

32:03.033 --> 32:04.340
Have you seen Richard around?

32:04.340 --> 32:06.070
- He's running some
errands, but he should be

32:06.070 --> 32:07.053
back by lunch.

32:12.020 --> 32:15.330
I'm done for now, so, we
can do whatever you want

32:15.330 --> 32:16.546
in the meantime.

32:18.816 --> 32:19.991
- How about a tour?

32:20.800 --> 32:22.960
-  You should see it in the autumn.

32:22.960 --> 32:24.410
-  Yeah?

32:24.410 --> 32:26.780
Well maybe I'll come
back for Thanksgiving.

32:26.780 --> 32:28.690
- We'd like that.

32:28.690 --> 32:30.640
Richard's already working on the menu, so.

32:30.640 --> 32:34.590
- Oh, yeah, wild turkey
straight from off the property?

32:34.590 --> 32:38.410
- Sorry to, uh, disappoint,
but there are no animals

32:38.410 --> 32:39.500
on the premises.
- No?

32:39.500 --> 32:40.525
No pets?

32:41.230 --> 32:42.780
- No.

32:42.780 --> 32:47.077
I mean, Richard's always
talking about horses, but, no.

32:47.077 --> 32:48.403
Not at the moment.

32:51.770 --> 32:54.020
- Can I ask how you guys met?

32:54.020 --> 32:55.884
- Me and Richard?
- Yeah.

32:55.884 --> 32:57.970
- The internet.
(Seth chuckles)

32:57.970 --> 32:59.893
- Yep, that makes sense.

33:01.550 --> 33:02.649
- What's that supposed to mean?

33:02.649 --> 33:04.380
- It doesn't, no, no, it
doesn't mean anything.

33:04.380 --> 33:06.990
I'm just saying, Richard
doesn't seem like the type

33:06.990 --> 33:08.790
who's trolling a college bar.

33:08.790 --> 33:09.900
Although he does seem
like the type who would

33:09.900 --> 33:11.307
have a roofie in his
pocket, so that works.

33:11.307 --> 33:13.407
- Oh, and you would know
all about what that's--

33:13.407 --> 33:15.570
- No, no I'm sorry, you
know, SugarBabies.com

33:15.570 --> 33:17.620
seems like a very reputable place to

33:17.620 --> 33:19.823
form a lasting connection.
- Oh, very funny.

33:20.750 --> 33:22.403
Just, for the record,

33:23.700 --> 33:27.760
I didn't know about his lifestyle

33:27.760 --> 33:28.980
when we first started dating.

33:28.980 --> 33:30.040
- He didn't tell you
about this in the first

33:30.040 --> 33:31.400
couple of seconds?

33:31.400 --> 33:35.620
- I mean, I knew he had money, but um,

33:35.620 --> 33:37.250
not like this.

33:37.250 --> 33:38.683
- Don't know why he'd hide it.

33:40.358 --> 33:41.600
There's so many of them.

33:41.600 --> 33:42.641
- The staff?

33:43.610 --> 33:45.273
It's only about half, really.

33:46.160 --> 33:48.040
They're usually not here
on the weekends, but,

33:48.040 --> 33:50.633
we're trying to finish the cabin.

33:50.633 --> 33:53.383
(Richard grunts)

33:58.920 --> 34:00.070
Hey baby.

34:00.070 --> 34:01.100
- Give me a second.

34:01.100 --> 34:02.730
- I didn't know you were gonna be home,

34:02.730 --> 34:04.550
I would've uh--
- I said,

34:04.550 --> 34:05.400
give me a second.

34:08.288 --> 34:11.397
(breathing deeply)

34:11.397 --> 34:14.364
(grunts)
Eh, you fucker.

34:14.364 --> 34:16.447
(grunts)

34:17.540 --> 34:18.860
Sit tight, all right?

34:18.860 --> 34:20.029
- Mhm.

34:20.029 --> 34:21.579
- This wood aint gonna beat me.

34:24.720 --> 34:29.083
You stay there 'cause I am
going to chop you. Right now.

34:30.493 --> 34:32.576
(grunts)

34:34.795 --> 34:35.712
Fuck.

34:36.660 --> 34:40.230
Yeah, I got back uh, (grunts)

34:40.230 --> 34:41.423
48 minutes ago.

34:42.627 --> 34:44.950
(grunting)

34:44.950 --> 34:47.740
Realized we used the last
of our stores last night.

34:47.740 --> 34:48.980
- You know you could've
had one of the groundsmen

34:48.980 --> 34:50.310
take care of that for you.

34:50.310 --> 34:51.463
- I handle my own wood.

34:52.370 --> 34:54.604
Seth, it's good to see you again, brother.

34:54.604 --> 34:55.633
- Good morning, Richard.

34:57.769 --> 34:58.602
- Did you have breakfast?

34:58.602 --> 34:59.435
- Yeah.
- Good for you.

34:59.435 --> 35:01.510
It's the most important meal of the day.

35:01.510 --> 35:03.623
Your kindergarten teacher
wasn't yankin' your dick.

35:03.623 --> 35:05.380
(chuckles)
- No.

35:05.380 --> 35:07.330
No, I know, I never thought of Miss Grant

35:07.330 --> 35:08.520
as a dick yanking type.

35:08.520 --> 35:11.550
- Nor should you, that's
gross, and it's illegal.

35:11.550 --> 35:14.050
Abby, would you grab us
a couple of swimsuits

35:14.050 --> 35:17.400
and meet us at the pool
in 10 minutes? 11 minutes?

35:17.400 --> 35:18.960
- Sure.

35:18.960 --> 35:20.072
You got it.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.833
(insects buzzing)

35:25.457 --> 35:26.833
See you guys in a few.

35:30.037 --> 35:31.613
- Help me out with my wood here.

35:33.413 --> 35:35.440
(insects buzzing)

35:35.440 --> 35:37.230
Seth, I wanna apologize if I came off

35:37.230 --> 35:39.580
a bit strong last night.

35:39.580 --> 35:43.123
I realize you may not know
me so well, but, I know you,

35:44.144 --> 35:45.253
and I care about you,

35:48.280 --> 35:49.580
and you're my brother.

35:50.417 --> 35:51.433
- Thanks Richard, I appreciate it--

35:51.433 --> 35:52.683
- I only want you to succeed.

35:53.720 --> 35:55.490
I've done a lot of bushwhacking in my time

35:55.490 --> 35:57.880
so if there's something I
can offer to make the journey

35:57.880 --> 36:01.520
a little bit easier for you,
then that's what I wanna do.

36:01.520 --> 36:03.050
- Richard?

36:03.050 --> 36:04.070
- Yes, sir?

36:04.070 --> 36:06.410
- Abby said you don't have pets.

36:06.410 --> 36:07.468
- We don't.

36:08.170 --> 36:09.178
- There's a dog.

36:10.525 --> 36:11.483
- Where?

36:11.483 --> 36:12.474
- Or there was.

36:13.526 --> 36:16.650
(insects buzzing)

36:16.650 --> 36:18.140
- Must be a stray.

36:18.140 --> 36:20.313
There's a busted piece
of fence back there.

36:22.160 --> 36:23.218
I'll tell Armando.

36:24.158 --> 36:25.166
Come on.

36:26.176 --> 36:29.140
(insects buzzing)

36:29.140 --> 36:32.142
- Listen Richard, um, I need
to thank you for the money--

36:32.142 --> 36:33.133
- Hey.
- That was--

36:33.133 --> 36:34.057
- Don't ever do that.

36:34.057 --> 36:36.070
Don't you ever let me
hear those fucking words

36:36.070 --> 36:37.300
come out of your mouth again.

36:37.300 --> 36:38.242
- What?

36:38.242 --> 36:39.490
- Don't ever thank someone for giving you

36:39.490 --> 36:40.580
what you earned.

36:40.580 --> 36:42.200
- But--
- But my ass.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.380
This was the arrangement.

36:43.380 --> 36:44.571
You get what you earn.

36:45.597 --> 36:47.097
And that's all there is to it.

36:51.638 --> 36:53.971
(splashing)

36:58.940 --> 37:00.823
Baptism by water, baby!

37:01.780 --> 37:03.410
Woo!

37:03.410 --> 37:04.713
Brother bear, hop in.

37:05.440 --> 37:06.460
- Um. I'm gonna wait for a minute.

37:06.460 --> 37:08.920
- The water's 81 degrees,
don't be a pussy.

37:08.920 --> 37:11.198
Besides, I can't play Sharks
and Minnows by myself.

37:11.198 --> 37:13.865
(Abby chuckles)

37:14.948 --> 37:15.960
Now we got two.

37:18.810 --> 37:20.210
- What's Sharks and Minnows?

37:21.310 --> 37:22.620
- All right, are you ready?

37:22.620 --> 37:23.453
- Ready.

37:23.453 --> 37:24.360
-  Are you ready?

37:24.360 --> 37:25.390
- I guess.

37:25.390 --> 37:26.730
- Sharks and Minnows.

37:27.928 --> 37:30.261
(splashing)

37:37.690 --> 37:40.047
I'm gonna drag him into the shallows!

37:40.047 --> 37:43.047
I'm gonna drag him in and drown him!

37:45.200 --> 37:47.610
Swimmin' at the surface?

37:47.610 --> 37:49.023
Rookie mistake, minnow!

37:50.919 --> 37:52.650
(coughs)

37:52.650 --> 37:53.740
- Dude you almost drowned me!

37:53.740 --> 37:55.053
- No, I didn't.

37:56.215 --> 37:57.170
Great job babe.

37:57.170 --> 37:58.233
- Thanks, babe.

37:59.380 --> 38:02.083
- Seth, get your ass over here now.

38:05.573 --> 38:08.740
(birds chirping)

38:08.740 --> 38:10.223
Go, doggy paddle, let's go.

38:10.223 --> 38:11.223
- I'm coming.

38:11.223 --> 38:13.030
- All right, here's what we're gonna do.

38:14.610 --> 38:17.830
You're gonna go up strong,
up the center, raise up,

38:17.830 --> 38:18.960
try to catch her.

38:18.960 --> 38:21.590
I'll cover each flank for
when you inevitably fail.

38:21.590 --> 38:22.700
Got it?
- Yeah.

38:22.700 --> 38:23.940
- Ready?
- Yeah.

38:23.940 --> 38:24.773
- You ready?

38:24.773 --> 38:25.963
-  Ready.

38:25.963 --> 38:26.796
- All right.

38:26.796 --> 38:29.129
(splashing)

38:29.970 --> 38:31.420
Sharks and Minnows round two!

38:35.614 --> 38:38.364
(dramatic music)

39:07.480 --> 39:09.190
Oh, fuck!
(buzzing)

39:09.190 --> 39:10.114
-  What is it?

39:10.114 --> 39:11.230
-  Babe, just take it out.

39:11.230 --> 39:15.137
- Ugh, I'm trying to.
(buzzing)

39:15.137 --> 39:16.163
(grunts)

39:16.163 --> 39:18.783
This thing is not waterproof, actually!

39:19.880 --> 39:20.713
-  Can I do anything?

39:20.713 --> 39:22.053
-  Just stay there.

39:24.167 --> 39:25.500
- What is it?

39:25.500 --> 39:26.425
- Hearing aid.

39:26.425 --> 39:28.045
Must've gotten waterlogged.

39:28.045 --> 39:29.000
- Are you serious?

39:29.000 --> 39:29.966
- Yeah.

39:30.810 --> 39:32.010
He hates false advertising.

39:32.010 --> 39:34.640
He'll probably have the
whole company shut down now.

39:34.640 --> 39:37.150
- No, I'm talking about the hearing aid.

39:37.150 --> 39:40.250
- Yeah, ever since the accident.

39:40.250 --> 39:41.083
- What accident?

39:42.090 --> 39:43.490
- The one that killed Daisy.

39:44.340 --> 39:45.485
- Who's Daisy?

39:46.640 --> 39:47.903
- His wife.

39:48.980 --> 39:52.220
Jesus, Seth. You don't
know anything, do you?

39:52.220 --> 39:54.240
- Well, I mean, what was it?

39:54.240 --> 39:55.310
What happened?

39:55.310 --> 39:56.910
- It's really his story to tell.

39:57.900 --> 39:59.520
- Was it his fault?

39:59.520 --> 40:01.369
- No, of course not.

40:01.369 --> 40:02.572
- Was he drunk?
- No.

40:02.572 --> 40:03.572
I, I don't think so.

40:04.790 --> 40:05.985
- Then what was it?

40:08.100 --> 40:08.933
- You saw.

40:09.800 --> 40:12.980
Winding roads, no streetlights.

40:12.980 --> 40:14.143
You drove 'em yourself.

40:15.180 --> 40:19.211
He spiraled into a telephone
pole, you know, and--

40:19.211 --> 40:21.710
- Yeah, and he lost the
hearing in his left ear,

40:21.710 --> 40:23.003
and she lost her life.

40:24.120 --> 40:26.510
And we spiraled into a wall,
not a telephone pole, Abby.

40:26.510 --> 40:28.460
If you're gonna tell it, tell it right.

40:29.400 --> 40:31.080
Seth. Hot tub. Now.

40:32.413 --> 40:37.413
(birds chirping)
(insects buzzing)

40:38.847 --> 40:40.142
(water bubbling)

40:40.142 --> 40:41.203
- Ah.

40:41.203 --> 40:42.470
It's hot.

40:42.470 --> 40:44.230
- Very perceptive, bro. I like it.

40:44.230 --> 40:45.890
- Look, just give me a sec.

40:47.160 --> 40:48.940
(water bubbling)

40:48.940 --> 40:52.110
So, uh, are you all right, Richard?

40:52.110 --> 40:54.120
- Did I patronize you about your dead mom?

40:54.120 --> 40:56.680
Don't patronize me about my dead wife.

40:56.680 --> 40:59.217
Stop being a pansy and get in the water.

40:59.217 --> 41:03.260
(splashes)
(grunts)

41:03.260 --> 41:04.705
Atta boy.

41:04.705 --> 41:07.455
(water bubbling)

41:10.635 --> 41:12.230
(Seth chuckles)

41:12.230 --> 41:14.510
I remember the first time
I fucked Abby in here.

41:14.510 --> 41:15.680
- Jesus, Richard.

41:15.680 --> 41:16.880
- Yeah, that's what she said.

41:16.880 --> 41:18.340
- Why are you telling me this shit?

41:18.340 --> 41:19.447
- What, you honestly trying to tell me

41:19.447 --> 41:21.432
you wouldn't wanna bang
Abby in this hot tub?

41:21.432 --> 41:22.428
- No!

41:22.428 --> 41:24.530
Dude, that's your girlfr- No! I don't. No.

41:24.530 --> 41:26.283
- Uh huh, just like I thought.

41:29.880 --> 41:31.870
She's fuckin' hot, right?

41:31.870 --> 41:33.610
- Yeah, Richard, she's fucking hot.

41:33.610 --> 41:34.923
- God damn right she is.

41:36.393 --> 41:39.143
(water bubbling)

41:41.920 --> 41:43.003
Abby.

41:43.900 --> 41:44.983
Come here, baby.

41:46.428 --> 41:49.178
(water bubbling)

42:12.870 --> 42:14.011
- What's up, boys?

42:15.136 --> 42:17.886
(water bubbling)

42:22.665 --> 42:24.570
- Do me a favor and put
this in recycling for me,

42:24.570 --> 42:26.494
and would you bring me a new one?

42:26.494 --> 42:27.752
- What did you have in mind?

42:27.752 --> 42:30.330
- I'm thinking about a Moscow mule,

42:30.330 --> 42:32.490
and that Moscow mule
has a friend who is also

42:32.490 --> 42:33.620
a Moscow mule.

42:35.250 --> 42:37.490
- Oh no, thanks, not
for, I don't want one.

42:37.490 --> 42:39.243
- So two Moscow mules.

42:40.684 --> 42:41.890
Aspetuck?

42:41.890 --> 42:43.130
Two Roads?

42:43.130 --> 42:44.450
Black Hog?

42:44.450 --> 42:45.283
Nothin'?

42:45.283 --> 42:46.160
- You sure, nothing?

42:46.160 --> 42:46.993
- She's puttin' out.

42:46.993 --> 42:49.330
You gonna turn her down and be a pan-say?

42:49.330 --> 42:51.474
-  Anything you want.

42:51.474 --> 42:52.480
- Do you have ginger ale?

42:52.480 --> 42:54.650
(grunts)

42:54.650 --> 42:58.130
- Two Moscow mules and a
ginger ale, coming right up.

42:58.130 --> 43:00.072
- Thank you, baby. I know you're busy.

43:00.072 --> 43:01.297
-  Thank you.

43:02.450 --> 43:05.200
(water bubbling)

43:11.897 --> 43:13.063
- You got a girl?

43:14.416 --> 43:15.449
- No.

43:15.449 --> 43:17.050
No, not, not right now.

43:17.050 --> 43:18.470
-  Why?

43:18.470 --> 43:19.939
- Just don't.

43:19.939 --> 43:21.439
- That aint no kind of answer.

43:22.380 --> 43:23.810
- I have other priorities right now.

43:23.810 --> 43:25.420
- Like what?

43:25.420 --> 43:26.503
Blink?

43:29.230 --> 43:33.070
Alright, what would you
say is the reason why

43:33.070 --> 43:35.640
honeys avoid you like the Bubonic Plague?

43:35.640 --> 43:38.100
Is it your lack of financial stability?

43:38.100 --> 43:41.130
The general cloud of
melancholy that follows you

43:41.130 --> 43:43.010
around everywhere you go?

43:43.010 --> 43:43.993
Your breath?

43:43.993 --> 43:44.990
- Excuse me?

43:44.990 --> 43:47.053
- All right, we're gettin' there.

43:49.810 --> 43:51.273
Lackluster sexual prowess?

43:52.482 --> 43:54.980
Am I getting warmer?!
- Go fuck yourself, man!

43:54.980 --> 43:57.404
- Oh Abby fucks me, I don't fuck myself.

43:57.404 --> 43:58.410
(scoffs)

43:58.410 --> 43:59.900
- What the hell is your problem?

43:59.900 --> 44:01.150
- I'm trying to help you.

44:02.960 --> 44:04.043
What's my problem?

44:05.271 --> 44:08.021
(water bubbling)

44:09.910 --> 44:11.010
Are you gay?

44:12.130 --> 44:14.880
(water bubbling)

44:16.240 --> 44:19.140
(splashes)
Ah!

44:19.140 --> 44:21.770
I got you, you motherfucker.

44:21.770 --> 44:23.700
Balls busted.

44:23.700 --> 44:25.630
I'm a homophobe.

44:25.630 --> 44:27.550
- All right, you--
- Oh come on.

44:27.550 --> 44:28.383
- Stop!

44:28.383 --> 44:29.960
- Bustin' my balls, huh?

44:29.960 --> 44:31.800
Come on, come on.

44:31.800 --> 44:33.270
I'm a homophobe, all right?

44:33.270 --> 44:34.390
I'm a bigot now?

44:34.390 --> 44:37.670
Come on, but pussy all
the way, am I right?

44:37.670 --> 44:40.170
- Thank you, thank you, I think I'm just

44:40.170 --> 44:41.770
gonna head home now.

44:41.770 --> 44:43.980
- What are you talkin' about?

44:43.980 --> 44:45.220
Seth.

44:45.220 --> 44:46.190
You just got here.

44:46.190 --> 44:47.820
- Yeah I know, like I said.

44:47.820 --> 44:48.773
Beautiful property.

44:50.670 --> 44:51.670
- Seth!

44:52.834 --> 44:55.251
(moody music)

44:55.265 --> 44:56.965
(birds caw)

45:01.170 --> 45:03.790
- Seth, what were you thinking for dinner?

45:03.790 --> 45:05.060
- Whatever you want.

45:05.060 --> 45:06.520
I'm not gonna be here.

45:06.520 --> 45:07.578
- What?

45:08.679 --> 45:11.096
(clattering)

45:13.780 --> 45:14.930
Seth.

45:16.153 --> 45:17.253
What happened?

45:17.253 --> 45:19.923
- Nothing, I just, I
gotta go back to the city.

45:22.500 --> 45:23.990
- But I thought we were gonna hang out.

45:23.990 --> 45:25.180
- Abby.

45:25.180 --> 45:26.113
We did.

45:28.360 --> 45:30.730
Look, if you're ever in
my neck of the woods,

45:30.730 --> 45:31.960
you should look me up.

45:31.960 --> 45:33.710
I'm sure that Richard has
everything you need to find me.

45:33.710 --> 45:36.900
- Seth, I'm really loving talking to you--

45:36.900 --> 45:38.267
- So do I, but I'm not gonna stay here

45:38.267 --> 45:40.207
and be the butt of Richard's joke anymore.

45:40.207 --> 45:41.630
- I'll talk to him.

45:41.630 --> 45:43.400
I'll talk to him, and it'll be fine.

45:43.400 --> 45:44.400
- You shouldn't be here either.

45:44.400 --> 45:45.600
You know this place isn't good for you.

45:45.600 --> 45:46.500
- Seth, please stay.

45:46.500 --> 45:48.660
- Abby, this has nothing to do with you.

45:48.660 --> 45:49.947
You are unbelievable and fascinating--

45:49.947 --> 45:51.893
- I love it when you say shit like that.

45:55.770 --> 45:57.165
- I have to leave.

45:57.165 --> 45:59.607
(door opens)

45:59.607 --> 46:01.070
- What, are you fucking kidding me?

46:01.070 --> 46:02.430
Seth.
- Richard.

46:02.430 --> 46:04.183
- Just stay one more day.

46:06.767 --> 46:07.692
- What's that?

46:07.692 --> 46:08.633
-  10,000.

46:08.633 --> 46:09.550
- Are you bribing me?

46:09.550 --> 46:10.640
- Fuckin'-A right I'm bribing you.

46:10.640 --> 46:12.910
- Why do you even care if I'm here?!

46:12.910 --> 46:14.570
- Look, Seth.

46:14.570 --> 46:17.300
You're my only brother
and I know, I guess I

46:17.300 --> 46:20.283
screwed up royally, but,
you gotta give me a chance

46:20.283 --> 46:21.386
to make it right.

46:22.270 --> 46:23.295
Take the money.

46:24.570 --> 46:25.528
- I can't.

46:25.528 --> 46:26.394
- Sure you can.

46:26.394 --> 46:27.410
You have a hand and you
have a checking account.

46:27.410 --> 46:29.780
I've seen it. Don't act
like you don't need this.

46:29.780 --> 46:30.830
Take the money, Seth.

46:33.860 --> 46:35.210
- One day.

46:35.210 --> 46:36.910
- Yeah, that's the deal.

46:38.299 --> 46:41.049
(birds chirping)

46:43.133 --> 46:45.633
(Seth scoffs)

46:48.990 --> 46:49.965
Bro.

46:51.410 --> 46:52.360
No?

46:53.470 --> 46:54.890
Too soon.

46:54.890 --> 46:55.723
That's cool.

46:57.198 --> 46:58.314
We'll get there.

47:01.120 --> 47:02.343
Party's back on!

47:05.960 --> 47:08.710

(maniacal laughing)

49:41.001 --> 49:44.043
- I love those little guys.

49:44.043 --> 49:45.650
That was fun.
- That was fun.

49:45.650 --> 49:48.230
- It was so fun.
- So fun.

49:48.230 --> 49:49.940
- Oh, oh.

49:49.940 --> 49:51.320
Seth?

49:51.320 --> 49:52.733
- Yeah, Richard. Super fun.

49:56.250 --> 49:57.320
- Okay.

49:57.320 --> 50:01.660
Well, it's late. We could
probably all use a little sleep.

50:01.660 --> 50:03.533
Some of us more than others.

50:04.460 --> 50:07.443
Why don't we start fresh in the morning?

50:15.690 --> 50:17.090
-  I'll see you later.

50:20.150 --> 50:21.300
-  Good night.

50:22.330 --> 50:23.555
- Good night, Richard.

50:26.109 --> 50:27.592
- Want one?

50:27.592 --> 50:28.800
- No, thanks.

50:29.800 --> 50:32.383
(curtain whirs)

50:35.730 --> 50:38.510
- So, what were you working
on today during lunch?

50:38.510 --> 50:42.070
- Oh um, I mean it was kind
of a business plan, but--

50:42.070 --> 50:43.060
- That's awesome.

50:43.060 --> 50:44.620
- Nah, it's stupid.

50:44.620 --> 50:45.640
- You should show Richard.

50:45.640 --> 50:46.540
- No.

50:46.540 --> 50:47.481
- I'm serious.
- No.

50:47.481 --> 50:48.620
- He's really good at that kind of stuff.

50:48.620 --> 50:50.020
- Okay, I'll think about it.

50:50.942 --> 50:51.933
- Good.

50:54.030 --> 50:55.320
- Look, I'm really exhausted.

50:55.320 --> 50:56.680
I didn't get much sleep last night, so--

50:56.680 --> 50:59.513
- You know, you could've just come in.

51:02.070 --> 51:03.040
- What?

51:03.040 --> 51:04.073
- Last night.

51:04.930 --> 51:06.363
Come in, to our room.

51:07.270 --> 51:08.660
- I really wish you had.

51:08.660 --> 51:09.610
- I'm sorry?

51:10.360 --> 51:12.200
- If you're ever having trouble sleeping.

51:12.200 --> 51:15.500
Richard and I are like
total night owls, so,

51:15.500 --> 51:17.470
if that ever happens
again, totally feel free

51:17.470 --> 51:18.540
to knock on the door.

51:18.540 --> 51:21.156
We'll get up, watch a movie with you.

51:21.156 --> 51:23.560
You could've checked this
place out a whole lot sooner.

51:23.560 --> 51:24.393
- Right.

51:25.500 --> 51:26.433
- Oh.

51:26.433 --> 51:27.803
While I was doing laundry,

51:29.190 --> 51:31.780
I found this.

51:31.780 --> 51:33.630
I didn't know you had
any of these made up.

51:33.630 --> 51:34.463
- Yeah.

51:34.463 --> 51:35.890
One, and it's mine.

51:35.890 --> 51:38.780
- Well I was thinking
about what we talked about

51:38.780 --> 51:42.723
the other night and I thought
that maybe I could help.

51:43.870 --> 51:45.550
Model, I mean.

51:45.550 --> 51:46.800
I think it'd be really good for you.

51:46.800 --> 51:48.770
- Abby, that's really generous, but I--

51:48.770 --> 51:49.603
- But nothing.

51:50.470 --> 51:52.720
You can even have me
for the family discount.

51:53.890 --> 51:55.260
Free.

51:55.260 --> 51:56.790
We can do it right now if you want.

51:56.790 --> 51:59.000
- It's the only one that I have.

51:59.000 --> 51:59.952
And it's too big for you.

51:59.952 --> 52:03.017
- No, I'll just tie it
up and crop it, watch.

52:15.710 --> 52:16.776
There.

52:18.400 --> 52:19.450
How do I look?

52:21.950 --> 52:24.690
- Did Richard put you up to all this?

52:24.690 --> 52:25.723
- What?

52:25.723 --> 52:28.130
- Did Richard ask you to do this?

52:28.130 --> 52:31.160
Offering to model and
taking off your clothes

52:31.160 --> 52:32.530
in front of me and kissing me.

52:32.530 --> 52:35.716
- I'm just trying to help, Seth.

52:35.716 --> 52:37.607
And I kissed you because...

52:40.670 --> 52:42.010
- Yeah.

52:42.010 --> 52:44.610
Look Abby, it's a really
nice offer, but I think

52:44.610 --> 52:46.623
I'm gonna pass. At least for tonight.

52:49.440 --> 52:50.665
- Okay.

52:52.630 --> 52:56.770
I guess I'll, um, see
you in the morning then.

52:56.770 --> 52:57.903
- Yep.

53:02.140 --> 53:03.240
- Just for the record,

53:04.970 --> 53:06.367
I'm really glad you stayed.

53:29.677 --> 53:31.927
(inhale)

53:33.833 --> 53:35.587
(exhale)

53:35.587 --> 53:39.037
(insects buzzing)

53:45.369 --> 53:47.369
(sighs)

53:49.186 --> 53:52.019
(insects buzzing)

53:58.296 --> 54:03.296
(dog sniffing)
(insects buzzing)

54:11.970 --> 54:13.970
(sighs)

54:15.100 --> 54:17.933
(insects buzzing)

54:24.013 --> 54:26.430
(dog whines)

54:35.988 --> 54:38.821
(insects buzzing)

54:44.305 --> 54:45.454
- Hey.

54:51.423 --> 54:53.840
(dog whines)

55:06.975 --> 55:11.225
("Moonlight Sonata" by Beethoven)

56:16.086 --> 56:19.453
("Moonlight Sonata" intensifies)

56:36.888 --> 56:38.405
What the fuck?!

56:41.223 --> 56:44.390
(soft, strange music)

56:58.360 --> 56:59.626
- Seth?

57:00.429 --> 57:02.470
(Seth groans)

57:02.470 --> 57:03.920
I thought you might be awake.

57:06.308 --> 57:07.233
- Abby?

57:07.233 --> 57:09.163
Are you, did the piano wake you up?

57:10.020 --> 57:11.040
- What piano?

57:11.040 --> 57:13.570
- There was, there was pi--

57:13.570 --> 57:16.240
Richard was just playing the piano.

57:16.240 --> 57:19.720
He was butt naked in the
darkness. It was really weird.

57:19.720 --> 57:21.530
- He must've been sleep walking.

57:21.530 --> 57:22.736
It, uh, happens.

57:23.482 --> 57:26.182
- I didn't know you could
play a sonata in your sleep.

57:27.050 --> 57:28.225
- Neither did I.

57:30.120 --> 57:31.203
Can I come in?

57:31.904 --> 57:34.404
(Seth grunts)

57:38.042 --> 57:39.150
- Are you all right?

57:39.150 --> 57:42.210
- Yeah, um, I told you you
could knock on my door any time,

57:42.210 --> 57:44.763
so I thought the offer went both ways.

57:46.950 --> 57:48.210
- Is Richard, um?

57:48.210 --> 57:49.285
- Oh.

57:49.285 --> 57:51.480
His REM cycle just kicked in.

57:51.480 --> 57:52.945
Said so on his FitBit, so...

57:52.946 --> 57:53.862
- Oh.

57:53.862 --> 57:55.393
- We've got at least, like, 80 minutes.

57:56.487 --> 57:57.490
I won't be long.

57:57.490 --> 58:00.383
I just wanted to check in with you.

58:01.960 --> 58:03.713
- Yeah I'm, I'm okay.

58:05.170 --> 58:07.550
- You really scared me today.

58:07.550 --> 58:09.160
- What do you mean?

58:09.160 --> 58:11.416
- I thought you were gonna leave.

58:11.416 --> 58:12.737
- Yeah Abby, I was.

58:15.580 --> 58:17.570
- Well would you mind if I just laid next

58:17.570 --> 58:18.430
to you for a little bit?

58:18.430 --> 58:20.610
This mattress is way more
comfortable than ours,

58:20.610 --> 58:21.560
and I was just gonna--

58:21.560 --> 58:22.903
- I--
- Please?

58:25.110 --> 58:27.322
Just for like a minute, I--
- Yeah, yeah.

58:27.322 --> 58:28.155
- Okay.

58:32.220 --> 58:33.053
Thanks.

58:42.230 --> 58:44.330
Where did you go to school?

58:44.330 --> 58:45.163
- What?

58:46.200 --> 58:47.053
- College.

58:47.890 --> 58:49.261
Where did you go to college?

58:49.261 --> 58:50.094
- Oh um,

58:51.752 --> 58:52.585
NYU.

58:54.250 --> 58:55.083
Why?

58:55.920 --> 58:56.993
- I went to Columbia.

58:58.710 --> 58:59.610
- Congratulations.

59:01.106 --> 59:03.356
(chuckles)

59:04.580 --> 59:06.720
- I was just thinking about
what it would've been like

59:06.720 --> 59:08.743
if we knew each other before this.

59:11.870 --> 59:13.662
- You would've ignored me.

59:13.662 --> 59:15.300
- That's not true.

59:15.300 --> 59:16.133
- Easy to say.

59:17.237 --> 59:18.880
- It's easy to mean.

59:18.880 --> 59:19.713
- Abby.

59:21.770 --> 59:23.350
Richard's right.

59:23.350 --> 59:24.183
I...

59:26.270 --> 59:27.980
I've got nothing going for me.

59:27.980 --> 59:29.515
- That's not true.

59:29.515 --> 59:31.875
- Yeah, it is.

59:31.875 --> 59:33.850
- You're just looking
in all the wrong places.

59:33.850 --> 59:38.850
I mean, you're passionate, introspective,

59:39.810 --> 59:42.090
a great sense of self.

59:42.090 --> 59:44.390
All those things make
someone really fuckable.

59:53.000 --> 59:57.333
(moaning)
(kissing)

1:00:03.613 --> 1:00:05.090
-  Wait, no, no, no, no, no.

1:00:05.090 --> 1:00:05.923
I can't.

1:00:05.923 --> 1:00:06.756
- Seth, come on, please.

1:00:06.756 --> 1:00:08.610
- No, Abby, I don't know
what's going on here.

1:00:08.610 --> 1:00:09.460
- Neither do I, but--

1:00:09.460 --> 1:00:11.630
-  No, stop, stop, please.

1:00:11.630 --> 1:00:12.760
- What, am I not your type or some shit?

1:00:12.760 --> 1:00:15.690
- Of course you're my type,
you're everybody's type.

1:00:15.690 --> 1:00:17.590
It doesn't matter, you're
fucking my brother.

1:00:17.590 --> 1:00:18.590
- Yeah.

1:00:18.590 --> 1:00:20.690
But right now, I am
trying to fuck you, so--

1:00:20.690 --> 1:00:21.800
- Abby, no.

1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:24.173
Look, you don't have to be here.

1:00:25.190 --> 1:00:26.160
You know that, right?

1:00:26.160 --> 1:00:27.960
You don't have to be in this house.

1:00:27.960 --> 1:00:30.467
You have a fucking multi-national
company or whatever.

1:00:30.467 --> 1:00:31.930
You probably make more in a day

1:00:31.930 --> 1:00:33.280
than I make in 10 years.

1:00:33.280 --> 1:00:34.670
One day you're gonna
have a place that makes

1:00:34.670 --> 1:00:35.603
this castle look like a fucking trailer.

1:00:35.603 --> 1:00:38.680
- Seth, just stop.
- Abby, why are you here?

1:00:38.680 --> 1:00:40.100
- It's complicated.

1:00:40.100 --> 1:00:41.643
-  It doesn't have to be.

1:00:44.470 --> 1:00:45.420
-  I'm going.

1:00:46.350 --> 1:00:47.820
- Abby.

1:00:47.820 --> 1:00:48.990
Abby, I'm...

1:00:48.990 --> 1:00:53.560
- Look, I, I am sorry
for whatever this was.

1:00:53.560 --> 1:00:56.490
Okay um, can we please just pretend like

1:00:56.490 --> 1:00:57.900
it didn't happen tomorrow?

1:00:57.900 --> 1:00:59.505
- Yeah.

1:00:59.505 --> 1:01:01.090
What, do you think I'm gonna tell Richard?

1:01:01.090 --> 1:01:01.923
- No.

1:01:02.910 --> 1:01:03.743
Of course not.

1:01:06.550 --> 1:01:07.463
- Listen, Abby.

1:01:10.360 --> 1:01:13.413
Uh, I'll see you in the morning.

1:01:14.530 --> 1:01:15.363
- Okay.

1:01:17.460 --> 1:01:18.610
Sorry to blue ball you.

1:01:20.922 --> 1:01:23.422
(door closes)

1:01:33.183 --> 1:01:36.100
(breathing softly)

1:01:40.493 --> 1:01:42.743
(sizzling)

1:01:46.854 --> 1:01:48.850
- Good morning, sleepy.

1:01:48.850 --> 1:01:50.840
Just in time for dinner.

1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:52.160
-  What?

1:01:52.160 --> 1:01:54.340
- Uh, it's five pm.

1:01:54.340 --> 1:01:55.710
- Oh.

1:01:55.710 --> 1:01:58.860
Shit, I slept all day.
(Richard chuckles)

1:01:58.860 --> 1:01:59.950
- Here.

1:01:59.950 --> 1:02:01.400
You need this more than I do.

1:02:02.790 --> 1:02:03.843
It's tomato juice.

1:02:09.323 --> 1:02:11.060
(sniffs)

1:02:11.060 --> 1:02:12.010
You don't trust me?

1:02:16.970 --> 1:02:21.050
Listen Seth, I don't wanna
cross any lines here.

1:02:21.050 --> 1:02:23.660
I realize that I'm sort
of on probation with you

1:02:23.660 --> 1:02:26.930
right now, but, I'd be
remiss if I didn't tell you

1:02:26.930 --> 1:02:30.220
that you really disappointed
Abby last night.

1:02:30.220 --> 1:02:33.683
I mean, she was really puttin'
herself out there for ya.

1:02:35.280 --> 1:02:36.160
- She told you about that?

1:02:36.160 --> 1:02:40.040
- Well yeah, she came to bed all deflated,

1:02:40.040 --> 1:02:42.963
I asked her what was
wrong and she told me.

1:02:43.940 --> 1:02:47.160
- Jesus, Richard, I'm sorry, man.

1:02:47.160 --> 1:02:47.993
She came--

1:02:47.993 --> 1:02:50.080
- Don't beat yourself up about it, but,

1:02:50.080 --> 1:02:52.280
do give it some thought
between now and dinner.

1:02:52.280 --> 1:02:55.580
She thinks it would
really help you and plus,

1:02:55.580 --> 1:02:56.653
it'd be fun for her.

1:02:59.340 --> 1:03:00.173
- What?

1:03:01.210 --> 1:03:03.900
- If you want, I could
even be there in the room,

1:03:03.900 --> 1:03:04.967
show you how everything works.

1:03:04.967 --> 1:03:06.230
- Are you fucking serious?

1:03:06.230 --> 1:03:07.550
- Seth.

1:03:07.550 --> 1:03:08.950
Relax.

1:03:08.950 --> 1:03:11.040
I'm not trying to freak you
out here, I'm just saying,

1:03:11.040 --> 1:03:12.910
if you want somebody to
be in the room to show you

1:03:12.910 --> 1:03:14.690
how to work the cameras,
I'm happy to do it.

1:03:14.690 --> 1:03:17.030
If you don't, that's fine.

1:03:17.030 --> 1:03:19.180
Do the fuckin' photo shoot
yourself, I don't care.

1:03:19.180 --> 1:03:20.363
- The photo shoot.

1:03:22.510 --> 1:03:23.463
- Yeah, for Blink.

1:03:24.590 --> 1:03:27.260
She said you were working
on a business plan, too,

1:03:27.260 --> 1:03:28.760
which is great.

1:03:28.760 --> 1:03:30.810
I'm happy to go through
that and redline it for ya,

1:03:30.810 --> 1:03:31.643
if you want.

1:03:33.720 --> 1:03:35.590
- That's, that's really nice, Richard,

1:03:35.590 --> 1:03:37.600
I gotta think about it.

1:03:37.600 --> 1:03:39.100
- Sure.

1:03:39.100 --> 1:03:39.933
Sit with it.

1:03:43.220 --> 1:03:44.783
- I think I'm gonna go for a walk now.

1:03:45.890 --> 1:03:48.090
-  The house
and grounds are yours.

1:03:49.500 --> 1:03:50.550
- Have you seen Abby?

1:03:52.410 --> 1:03:53.610
- Yeah, she's somewhere.

1:03:57.721 --> 1:04:00.971
(soft, dramatic music)

1:04:09.050 --> 1:04:09.883
- Abby!

1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:12.900
Abby, hey.

1:04:12.900 --> 1:04:14.725
Christ, I thought Richard fuckin' ate you.

1:04:14.725 --> 1:04:16.020
- Jesus Seth, you scared me.

1:04:16.020 --> 1:04:16.970
- I thought that...

1:04:18.360 --> 1:04:19.240
Nevermind.

1:04:19.240 --> 1:04:21.142
What are, what are you doin'?

1:04:21.142 --> 1:04:22.653
- Just getting some air.

1:04:24.950 --> 1:04:26.300
- I didn't know you smoked.

1:04:27.870 --> 1:04:29.403
- It's been a few months.

1:04:30.960 --> 1:04:32.660
- Are you sure you're okay?

1:04:32.660 --> 1:04:34.090
- I'm fine.

1:04:34.090 --> 1:04:36.740
Seth, you said--
- I know.

1:04:36.740 --> 1:04:38.640
I just--
- Okay, so,

1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:40.610
let's go figure out what
we're having for dinner.

1:04:40.610 --> 1:04:43.993
- Actually, I came to
find you to say good bye.

1:04:45.170 --> 1:04:46.150
- What?

1:04:46.150 --> 1:04:48.683
- I gotta head back to the
city before it gets dark.

1:04:50.050 --> 1:04:51.020
- You're leaving?

1:04:51.020 --> 1:04:52.330
- Yeah.

1:04:52.330 --> 1:04:55.270
It's been 24 hours,
Abby, that was the deal.

1:04:55.270 --> 1:04:56.503
- I know, but uh,

1:04:58.700 --> 1:05:00.490
well you're gonna do what
you're gonna do, I guess.

1:05:00.490 --> 1:05:02.460
- Abby, look, I'm sorry.

1:05:02.460 --> 1:05:04.290
I told you, this isn't about you.

1:05:04.290 --> 1:05:05.123
- I know, but...

1:05:07.920 --> 1:05:08.753
Look.

1:05:09.695 --> 1:05:13.747
He said he paid you to stay, and...

1:05:15.280 --> 1:05:16.773
he did, right?

1:05:17.750 --> 1:05:20.740
But what he was really do was paying you

1:05:20.740 --> 1:05:22.073
for a second chance.

1:05:23.438 --> 1:05:25.550
And I don't think you gave him one.

1:05:25.550 --> 1:05:28.120
- You expect me to just
pretend that he's not--

1:05:28.120 --> 1:05:28.953
- No.

1:05:29.920 --> 1:05:30.753
Of course not.

1:05:32.190 --> 1:05:34.513
But, look, it's been fine.

1:05:35.590 --> 1:05:36.423
Right?

1:05:36.423 --> 1:05:39.400
The last 24 hours have been fine.

1:05:39.400 --> 1:05:41.703
So, what have you got to lose?

1:05:43.120 --> 1:05:44.570
What are you running back to?

1:05:45.470 --> 1:05:48.400
A seventh floor walk up
with a rodent problem

1:05:48.400 --> 1:05:50.053
and no air conditioning?

1:05:51.960 --> 1:05:53.706
- It's the eighth floor.

1:05:53.706 --> 1:05:55.990
(chuckles)

1:05:55.990 --> 1:05:57.690
- Well it can't be any worse here.

1:06:00.059 --> 1:06:01.020
(laughing)

1:06:01.020 --> 1:06:03.860
We know all the same people.
- Yeah. (chuckles)

1:06:03.860 --> 1:06:04.693
It's a small world.

1:06:04.693 --> 1:06:05.550
-  Just in time.

1:06:05.550 --> 1:06:06.770
- Smells great, baby.

1:06:06.770 --> 1:06:07.603
- Yeah, it'll be good.

1:06:07.603 --> 1:06:10.550
Seth, I was wondering if I
could show you something.

1:06:10.550 --> 1:06:11.960
- Uh, what is it?

1:06:11.960 --> 1:06:13.090
- It's a

1:06:14.130 --> 1:06:15.053
surprise.

1:06:16.610 --> 1:06:18.740
Abby, throw these in
the fridge for me, baby.

1:06:18.740 --> 1:06:20.150
- Sure.

1:06:20.150 --> 1:06:20.983
- Let's walk.

1:06:32.200 --> 1:06:33.033
- Christ.

1:06:33.900 --> 1:06:35.700
You been collecting for a long time?

1:06:36.960 --> 1:06:38.323
- Since I was your age.

1:06:39.200 --> 1:06:42.253
Always came back from a
trip with a couple cases.

1:06:43.490 --> 1:06:45.483
Quickly turned into an obsession.

1:06:47.870 --> 1:06:48.703
Hobby.

1:06:51.610 --> 1:06:53.723
Every bottle is a story, Seth.

1:06:57.465 --> 1:06:58.298
A time capsule.

1:07:02.040 --> 1:07:03.290
Like tonight's selection.

1:07:05.259 --> 1:07:07.973
- The first night you banged
Abby in a hot air balloon?

1:07:11.840 --> 1:07:13.240
- First drink at my wedding.

1:07:17.090 --> 1:07:18.340
Only drink at my wedding.

1:07:24.310 --> 1:07:26.424
- Richard I'm, I'm really sorry.

1:07:26.424 --> 1:07:27.341
- Don't be.

1:07:31.310 --> 1:07:32.393
10 years.

1:07:35.210 --> 1:07:37.283
10 years since we opened the case.

1:07:41.760 --> 1:07:43.310
10 years since we said, "I do,"

1:07:47.220 --> 1:07:48.720
and I haven't had a sip since.

1:07:52.830 --> 1:07:57.830
Seth, tonight I wanna share this with you.

1:08:00.540 --> 1:08:02.489
- Richard, I would man, I just--

1:08:02.489 --> 1:08:04.763
- I know, I know you
have your thing, Seth.

1:08:06.018 --> 1:08:06.968
And I respect that.

1:08:10.991 --> 1:08:11.824
I don't know.

1:08:13.660 --> 1:08:18.653
Selfishly, tonight, feels
like an occasion for a family,

1:08:22.339 --> 1:08:24.289
and you're the only family I have left.

1:08:26.617 --> 1:08:30.530
And I know I can't rewrite the past.

1:08:34.880 --> 1:08:37.360
But I was thinking that

1:08:39.170 --> 1:08:43.333
maybe we could start
carving out something new,

1:08:46.160 --> 1:08:47.283
something for us.

1:08:51.516 --> 1:08:53.556
(upbeat piano music)

1:08:53.556 --> 1:08:55.710
♪ Camp town races sing this song ♪

1:08:55.710 --> 1:08:58.142
♪ Doo dah doo dah ♪

1:08:58.142 --> 1:09:00.480

(laughing)
(thunder rumbles)

1:09:17.180 --> 1:09:20.330
- Oh let me help you out there thirsty.

1:09:20.330 --> 1:09:21.190
- Oh no Richard, I'm good, no.

1:09:21.190 --> 1:09:23.735
- Oh there aint can't in decanter.

1:09:23.735 --> 1:09:24.568
- A little bit, a little bit.
- You can do it.

1:09:25.560 --> 1:09:26.670
- That's enough, that's enough, that's it.

1:09:26.670 --> 1:09:28.147
- I say when it's enough.

1:09:30.118 --> 1:09:32.340
- You guys, I just wanna
interrupt for a second

1:09:32.340 --> 1:09:35.530
and say that I am having actually a really

1:09:35.530 --> 1:09:36.830
good time with you.
- Oh!

1:09:38.030 --> 1:09:41.400
(thunder rumbles)

1:09:41.400 --> 1:09:42.830
Don't worry.

1:09:42.830 --> 1:09:44.733
Don't worry.

1:09:45.780 --> 1:09:46.999
Don't worry.

1:09:46.999 --> 1:09:48.520
-  Where are you going?

1:09:48.520 --> 1:09:50.070
I think we'll probably die.

1:09:50.070 --> 1:09:50.903
I don't think we'll survive this house.

1:09:50.903 --> 1:09:52.780
-  I don't know
how I'll ever survive.

1:09:52.780 --> 1:09:56.040
-  We're not gonna
die, we're not gonna die,

1:09:56.040 --> 1:09:59.150
because if we died, we
wouldn't be able to play

1:09:59.150 --> 1:10:00.630
flashlight tag.

1:10:00.630 --> 1:10:01.560
-  Dun, dun, dun.

1:10:01.560 --> 1:10:03.120
- I'm not playing flashlight tag.

1:10:03.120 --> 1:10:04.960
-  Yes you are
playing flashlight tag,

1:10:04.960 --> 1:10:08.450
brother bear, and what's
more is, you're it.

1:10:08.450 --> 1:10:09.630
- Oh Jesus.

1:10:09.630 --> 1:10:12.100
-  Jesus can't help you Seth.

1:10:12.100 --> 1:10:15.860
Piano's base, 20 Mississippis.

1:10:15.860 --> 1:10:17.520
-  Okay.

1:10:17.520 --> 1:10:20.450
-  And um, you
have to flash on the face

1:10:20.450 --> 1:10:21.763
in order for it to count.

1:10:22.950 --> 1:10:26.733
- And if I win, I get $100,000.

1:10:27.670 --> 1:10:28.600
-  Yes.

1:10:28.600 --> 1:10:29.970
-  Hey Richard, I'm joking.

1:10:29.970 --> 1:10:30.870
-  He's not.

1:10:35.310 --> 1:10:37.210
- One Mississippi.

1:10:37.210 --> 1:10:40.290
Two Mississippi, three
Mississippi, four Mississippi,

1:10:40.290 --> 1:10:41.140
five Mississippi.

1:10:44.230 --> 1:10:47.267
10 Mississippi, 11
Mississippi, 12, 13, 14,

1:10:47.267 --> 1:10:51.720
15, 16 Mississippi, 17
Mississippi, 18 Mississippi,

1:10:51.720 --> 1:10:55.170
19, 20 Mississippi!

1:10:55.170 --> 1:10:58.243
Ready or not, here I come.

1:10:59.176 --> 1:11:01.926
(dramatic music)

1:11:20.567 --> 1:11:22.868
(footsteps)

1:11:22.868 --> 1:11:23.701
Ah!

1:11:25.015 --> 1:11:26.530
Ha!
- Not quick enough.

1:11:26.530 --> 1:11:27.839
- Damn you.

1:11:27.839 --> 1:11:30.611
(Abby laughs)

1:11:30.611 --> 1:11:31.694
- Go get him.

1:11:33.150 --> 1:11:35.900
(dramatic music)

1:12:07.007 --> 1:12:09.165
(Seth laughs)

1:12:09.165 --> 1:12:10.084
- Motherfucker!

1:12:10.084 --> 1:12:11.148
-  You're it, you're it. (laughs)

1:12:11.148 --> 1:12:12.148
- Goddammit!

1:12:13.223 --> 1:12:18.007
I should've worn the
fuckin' ski mask. (sighs)

1:12:18.007 --> 1:12:18.857
I'm proud of you.

1:12:20.240 --> 1:12:22.494
That's how you play
fuckin' flashlight tag.

1:12:22.494 --> 1:12:25.161
(Seth chuckles)

1:12:27.420 --> 1:12:30.370
All right, round two, let's do this shit.

1:12:30.370 --> 1:12:32.770
One Mississippi--
- Babe.

1:12:32.770 --> 1:12:35.880
Don't you want a break?
- Two Mississippi.

1:12:35.880 --> 1:12:37.940
Three Mississippi.

1:12:37.940 --> 1:12:39.622
Four Mississippi.

1:12:39.622 --> 1:12:40.985
-  Abby, come on, come on, come on.

1:12:40.985 --> 1:12:41.818
Come on.

1:12:42.722 --> 1:12:44.540
-  Six Mississippi.

1:12:44.540 --> 1:12:45.707
-  Abby.

1:12:49.296 --> 1:12:52.463
-  Ready or not, here I come.

1:12:53.879 --> 1:12:56.629
(dramatic music)

1:13:43.347 --> 1:13:44.680
- What the fuck?

1:13:46.086 --> 1:13:48.836
(dramatic music)

1:13:56.051 --> 1:13:57.151
Fuck.

1:13:57.151 --> 1:13:57.984
Abby.

1:13:59.090 --> 1:14:00.437
Abby.

1:14:00.437 --> 1:14:01.270
Abby.

1:14:02.469 --> 1:14:04.973
(dramatic music)

1:14:04.973 --> 1:14:05.806
Abby!

1:14:09.447 --> 1:14:12.697
(slow, dramatic music)

1:14:22.440 --> 1:14:23.470
- You're it.

1:14:23.470 --> 1:14:24.759
-  Richard.

1:14:24.759 --> 1:14:25.592
What the fuck man?

1:14:25.592 --> 1:14:26.425
Where's Abby?

1:14:26.425 --> 1:14:27.930
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, calm down.

1:14:27.930 --> 1:14:30.153
- Get that fuckin'
flashlight out of my face.

1:14:31.110 --> 1:14:32.517
- Bro, relax.

1:14:32.517 --> 1:14:34.270
Why don't you breathe some steam?

1:14:34.270 --> 1:14:35.103
- Don't tell me to relax.

1:14:35.103 --> 1:14:37.200
Why do you have a camera in my bedroom?

1:14:37.200 --> 1:14:38.033
- Security.

1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:40.450
- Where the fuck is Abby?

1:14:40.450 --> 1:14:41.470
What did you do to her man?

1:14:41.470 --> 1:14:42.303
Stay back!

1:14:42.303 --> 1:14:43.933
Stay over there!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:14:43.933 --> 1:14:45.990
What did I just say?

1:14:45.990 --> 1:14:47.270
You need to relax.

1:14:47.270 --> 1:14:49.112
- I said stay the fuck back!

1:14:49.112 --> 1:14:50.120
- Oh.

1:14:50.120 --> 1:14:51.512
What are you gonna do with that?

1:14:51.512 --> 1:14:52.679
-  Seth?

1:14:54.289 --> 1:14:55.122
-  Abby.

1:14:55.122 --> 1:14:55.955
- Oh.

1:14:55.955 --> 1:14:56.955
- I thought,

1:14:58.154 --> 1:14:59.890
I thought that...

1:14:59.890 --> 1:15:01.140
- Give me this.

1:15:02.497 --> 1:15:03.830
Okay, it's okay.

1:15:08.090 --> 1:15:09.440
What's going on?

1:15:09.440 --> 1:15:12.240
- Brother bear here got
it in his head that I uh,

1:15:12.240 --> 1:15:15.100
I don't even know what, attacked you,

1:15:15.100 --> 1:15:17.550
and he started freakin' out.

1:15:17.550 --> 1:15:18.833
- Oh god, Seth.

1:15:20.830 --> 1:15:21.883
Your poor baby.

1:15:23.926 --> 1:15:27.176
(slow, dramatic music)

1:15:30.010 --> 1:15:31.820
- Abby, what the fuck is this?

1:15:32.909 --> 1:15:33.742
- Shh.

1:15:35.956 --> 1:15:37.890
I'm here for you.

1:15:37.890 --> 1:15:39.720
-  We both are.

1:15:39.720 --> 1:15:41.012
- What the fuck?

1:15:41.012 --> 1:15:44.447
- I think we all just need to relax,

1:15:44.447 --> 1:15:47.920
just a little. (chuckles)

1:15:47.920 --> 1:15:49.573
Don't you wanna play with us?

1:15:51.290 --> 1:15:52.903
We could all get in the shower.

1:15:55.020 --> 1:15:56.443
It'll be really fun.

1:15:57.722 --> 1:16:00.972
(slow, dramatic music)

1:16:04.370 --> 1:16:06.706
-  Abby, what the fuck is this?

1:16:06.706 --> 1:16:07.539
- Shh.

1:16:08.930 --> 1:16:10.133
It's okay, baby.

1:16:13.380 --> 1:16:14.470
- Seth.

1:16:14.470 --> 1:16:16.130
Listen to me.

1:16:16.130 --> 1:16:19.610
I am 100% okay with this.

1:16:19.610 --> 1:16:21.750
Isn't that what you've been
worried about this whole time?

1:16:21.750 --> 1:16:23.650
- Hey, get off me, get off me!

1:16:23.650 --> 1:16:25.150
- I wanna share this with you.

1:16:27.300 --> 1:16:29.673
- Just share with me, baby.

1:16:31.399 --> 1:16:32.232
(grunts)

1:16:32.232 --> 1:16:33.065
- Oh yeah.

1:16:34.079 --> 1:16:35.393
We like it rough.

1:16:36.870 --> 1:16:37.703
- Come on Seth.

1:16:39.210 --> 1:16:41.830
Why don't you show me what
you were thinking about

1:16:41.830 --> 1:16:43.080
when you walked in on me.

1:16:45.165 --> 1:16:48.415
(dramatic synth music)

1:16:57.348 --> 1:16:58.431
- My brother.

1:16:59.545 --> 1:17:00.378
(grunts)

1:17:00.378 --> 1:17:01.268
(yelling)

1:17:01.268 --> 1:17:02.101
- Fuck!

1:17:02.101 --> 1:17:03.921
What the shit?

1:17:03.921 --> 1:17:07.171
(dramatic synth music)

1:17:09.961 --> 1:17:12.294
(screaming)

1:17:15.316 --> 1:17:16.149
- Fuck!

1:17:16.149 --> 1:17:16.982
Fuck!

1:17:16.982 --> 1:17:18.254
Fuck!

1:17:18.254 --> 1:17:20.587
(screaming)

1:17:22.430 --> 1:17:23.789
Oh my god.

1:17:23.789 --> 1:17:25.166
Oh my fucking god.

1:17:25.166 --> 1:17:26.834
No, no, no.

1:17:26.834 --> 1:17:28.271
(grunts)

1:17:28.271 --> 1:17:31.981
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my
god, oh my god, oh my god.

1:17:31.981 --> 1:17:32.880
Fuck!

1:17:32.880 --> 1:17:34.203
Oh fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1:17:35.819 --> 1:17:37.707
He's fucking dead, he's fucking dead.

1:17:37.707 --> 1:17:38.540
Oh my god.

1:17:40.845 --> 1:17:42.521
- What did you do?

1:17:42.521 --> 1:17:45.307
(yells)

1:17:45.307 --> 1:17:48.557
(dramatic synth music)

1:17:52.109 --> 1:17:53.276
-  Fuck!

1:17:54.592 --> 1:17:57.842
(dramatic synth music)

1:18:05.567 --> 1:18:07.817
(grunting)

1:18:11.929 --> 1:18:15.679
(soft, dramatic synth music)

1:18:22.132 --> 1:18:24.549
(door opens)

1:18:26.452 --> 1:18:29.702
(soft, dramatic music)

1:19:09.370 --> 1:19:11.053
- I'm sure that's cold by now.

1:19:15.390 --> 1:19:18.520
But I'm happy to brew you
some more if you'd like.

1:19:18.520 --> 1:19:19.630
-  Who are you?

1:19:19.630 --> 1:19:22.010
- Regular, decaf, there's cream and sugar.

1:19:22.010 --> 1:19:24.070
- I don't want any fucking
coffee, who are you?

1:19:24.070 --> 1:19:26.410
- No more for me either, I get the jitters

1:19:26.410 --> 1:19:27.533
if I have too much.

1:19:31.118 --> 1:19:32.960
(beeps)
(door slams)

1:19:32.960 --> 1:19:34.220
We should talk.

1:19:34.220 --> 1:19:35.700
- Who the fuck are you man?

1:19:35.700 --> 1:19:38.080
Seriously, let me out of
here, I just wanna go home.

1:19:38.080 --> 1:19:41.553
- And you will, after sunrise.

1:19:42.420 --> 1:19:44.260
Why don't you come back
in here and, and, and--

1:19:44.260 --> 1:19:45.500
- Fuck you man.

1:19:45.500 --> 1:19:48.320
- There's security
cameras everywhere, Seth.

1:19:48.320 --> 1:19:50.673
I wouldn't put on a show if I were you.

1:19:53.310 --> 1:19:55.960
Also, that cue is made
of gold inlayed African

1:19:55.960 --> 1:19:58.568
black wood, it'd be a shame
to smash it over my head.

1:19:58.568 --> 1:20:00.651
(laughs)

1:20:01.550 --> 1:20:05.053
Why don't you just put
it down and take a seat,

1:20:06.370 --> 1:20:07.533
and we can talk.

1:20:09.060 --> 1:20:10.763
You're not going anywhere tonight.

1:20:14.555 --> 1:20:15.423
Right.

1:20:19.933 --> 1:20:21.367
There.

1:20:21.367 --> 1:20:22.450
There you go.

1:20:26.525 --> 1:20:29.400
You sure I can't interest
you in some coffee?

1:20:29.400 --> 1:20:32.230
Imported from Jamaica,
better than that crap you

1:20:32.230 --> 1:20:35.030
drink at the hipster bistro in the city.

1:20:35.030 --> 1:20:36.460
- Who the hell are you?

1:20:36.460 --> 1:20:40.230
- What would you say your
favorite part of the weekend was?

1:20:40.230 --> 1:20:44.520
Or was there any moment in
particular that was memorable--

1:20:44.520 --> 1:20:46.370
- Why the fuck am I here?

1:20:46.370 --> 1:20:48.020
- I told you.

1:20:48.020 --> 1:20:50.303
I figured it was time we met.

1:20:51.580 --> 1:20:55.033
Well he told you, but. (chuckles)

1:20:56.500 --> 1:20:58.160
- It's the wine.

1:20:58.160 --> 1:21:00.650
He drugged the fuckin' wine,
he drugged the fuckin' wine.

1:21:00.650 --> 1:21:01.860
I'm dreaming, wake up.

1:21:01.860 --> 1:21:03.027
Wake up!

1:21:03.027 --> 1:21:03.860
Wake up!
- Stop that, stop that.

1:21:03.860 --> 1:21:04.923
Stop it now.

1:21:06.630 --> 1:21:08.270
The wine was just wine.

1:21:08.270 --> 1:21:10.860
You drank it, you had fun.

1:21:10.860 --> 1:21:13.373
Someone died, but that happens.

1:21:17.167 --> 1:21:18.000
(sniffing)

1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:19.940
Oh, good girl.

1:21:19.940 --> 1:21:21.622
She really likes you.

1:21:21.622 --> 1:21:23.872
(knocking)

1:21:25.440 --> 1:21:27.963
Stay.
(knocking)

1:21:29.080 --> 1:21:30.770
- I told you he wasn't gonna go for it.

1:21:30.770 --> 1:21:32.800
- Well I was wrong about that.

1:21:32.800 --> 1:21:35.340
Still, very exciting, no?

1:21:35.340 --> 1:21:37.663
- You know this is
gonna cost extra, right?

1:21:42.430 --> 1:21:43.730
- Just fill in the number.

1:21:45.840 --> 1:21:46.673
- Abby?

1:21:47.920 --> 1:21:50.420
- You two are so fascinating.

1:21:50.420 --> 1:21:52.050
- Abby, please, I, I--

1:21:52.050 --> 1:21:55.030
- This is between you
and your brother, Seth.

1:21:55.030 --> 1:21:56.520
- My brother?

1:21:56.520 --> 1:21:57.380
My brother's dead.

1:21:57.380 --> 1:21:59.160
- You were supposed to be
eased into this tomorrow

1:21:59.160 --> 1:22:01.790
over breakfast but I'm happy
to answer any questions

1:22:01.790 --> 1:22:02.623
you may have.

1:22:02.623 --> 1:22:04.540
- Oh, let's not patronize him.

1:22:04.540 --> 1:22:06.123
I'm pretty sure he's figure it out by now.

1:22:06.123 --> 1:22:07.920
- Are you fucking insane?

1:22:07.920 --> 1:22:08.753
What's going on?

1:22:08.753 --> 1:22:10.570
Why did my brother invite me here?

1:22:10.570 --> 1:22:12.210
- I stand corrected.

1:22:12.210 --> 1:22:13.043
- Seth.

1:22:14.600 --> 1:22:15.593
Meet Richard.

1:22:17.921 --> 1:22:20.171
(chuckles)

1:22:21.540 --> 1:22:22.373
- No.

1:22:23.740 --> 1:22:24.750
What the fuck are you talking about?

1:22:24.750 --> 1:22:26.840
- Some artistic liberties
were taken for the sake

1:22:26.840 --> 1:22:28.420
of the dramatization but for all intents

1:22:28.420 --> 1:22:30.480
and purposes, you've been
interacting with your brother

1:22:30.480 --> 1:22:31.313
all weekend.

1:22:31.313 --> 1:22:34.080
- The third act was so exciting,

1:22:34.080 --> 1:22:38.519
but this unexpected epilogue,

1:22:38.519 --> 1:22:39.352
Abby, it was--

1:22:39.352 --> 1:22:41.850
- What do you people want from me?

1:22:41.850 --> 1:22:44.700
(coughing)

1:22:44.700 --> 1:22:47.760
- Nothing more than what
you've already given.

1:22:47.760 --> 1:22:49.993
This weekend has been incredible.

1:22:51.520 --> 1:22:52.373
- So what?

1:22:53.268 --> 1:22:54.920
You're telling me this
has all just been some

1:22:54.920 --> 1:22:56.020
fucked up prank?

1:22:56.020 --> 1:23:00.160
- No, no, no, no, no, this
has been very, very real.

1:23:00.160 --> 1:23:02.350
- Well, then who's that guy?

1:23:02.350 --> 1:23:03.500
- Oh him?

1:23:03.500 --> 1:23:04.333
He's no one.

1:23:04.333 --> 1:23:05.166
- No one?

1:23:05.166 --> 1:23:06.180
You were sleeping with him.

1:23:06.180 --> 1:23:08.940
- It's just sex, Seth,
it's part of the job.

1:23:08.940 --> 1:23:11.420
- So what's your end game here, Abby?

1:23:11.420 --> 1:23:14.370
Trying to screw me so that
this fucker can jerk off?

1:23:14.370 --> 1:23:15.660
- Please, Seth.

1:23:15.660 --> 1:23:16.513
Hardly.

1:23:17.680 --> 1:23:20.460
I had to catch up on 24 years.

1:23:20.460 --> 1:23:23.210
What better way to get
to know someone than by

1:23:23.210 --> 1:23:24.700
throwing them off balance?

1:23:24.700 --> 1:23:25.533
- That's crazy.

1:23:25.533 --> 1:23:26.600
- Let's call it unorthodox.

1:23:26.600 --> 1:23:27.832
-  Let's call it fucked.

1:23:27.832 --> 1:23:30.820
- You know you can pay
people to kidnap you.

1:23:30.820 --> 1:23:32.343
Literally, kidnap you.

1:23:33.840 --> 1:23:35.623
Just to see what it feels like.

1:23:37.270 --> 1:23:40.760
People pay to cuddle, pay to get tickled,

1:23:40.760 --> 1:23:43.770
pay to get beat up or shit on.

1:23:43.770 --> 1:23:47.550
I happen to hire someone
to orchestrate my own

1:23:47.550 --> 1:23:49.793
out of body experience.

1:23:51.010 --> 1:23:53.483
To each his own, am I right?

1:23:54.640 --> 1:23:55.963
If you've got the money.

1:23:58.070 --> 1:23:59.840
- No man, I gotta, I gotta go.

1:23:59.840 --> 1:24:01.223
I gotta go home, I gotta get out of here.

1:24:01.223 --> 1:24:03.760
- Well the gates won't
open until after sunrise,

1:24:03.760 --> 1:24:05.160
that's for your own safety.

1:24:05.160 --> 1:24:07.160
- Fuck your gate, man, I'll
drive right through it.

1:24:07.160 --> 1:24:08.610
- Steel bars, Seth.

1:24:08.610 --> 1:24:11.710
And I don't pay for collision
insurance on rentals.

1:24:11.710 --> 1:24:12.700
-  Then I'll hop it.

1:24:12.700 --> 1:24:14.160
- Seven miles?

1:24:14.160 --> 1:24:15.230
No street lights?

1:24:15.230 --> 1:24:16.543
Winding roads?

1:24:18.070 --> 1:24:20.400
I'd hate to have a drunk
driver take a turn too fast

1:24:20.400 --> 1:24:22.283
and pin you against a telephone pole.

1:24:25.800 --> 1:24:26.633
Stay.

1:24:27.670 --> 1:24:31.723
Continue to explore the
property while you wait and,

1:24:32.780 --> 1:24:34.093
it's a lovely night.

1:24:35.730 --> 1:24:37.823
Or stay here with me.

1:24:39.490 --> 1:24:40.723
I've got checkers.

1:24:42.870 --> 1:24:45.690
- Everyone is gonna know about this.

1:24:45.690 --> 1:24:46.523
- Abby.

1:24:48.270 --> 1:24:50.730
- You can't enforce that.
- I assure you I can.

1:24:50.730 --> 1:24:52.030
- After all of this bullshit?

1:24:52.030 --> 1:24:55.650
- I take my privacy very
seriously, as do my attorneys.

1:24:55.650 --> 1:24:56.600
That's air tight.

1:24:56.600 --> 1:24:58.217
- That guy is dead because of you.

1:24:58.217 --> 1:24:59.870
- And you're complicit.

1:24:59.870 --> 1:25:01.870
And there's tapes.

1:25:01.870 --> 1:25:04.300
At best, it's involuntary manslaughter.

1:25:04.300 --> 1:25:05.870
- I will fucking kill you.

1:25:05.870 --> 1:25:09.470
- Then add to that second degree murder,

1:25:09.470 --> 1:25:11.710
that's 30 years minimum.

1:25:11.710 --> 1:25:12.680
- Just wait out the night, Seth.

1:25:12.680 --> 1:25:14.800
- Shut up.

1:25:14.800 --> 1:25:17.683
- I'd love to keep talking.

1:25:18.830 --> 1:25:20.402
But that's of course up to you.

1:25:20.402 --> 1:25:21.673
(spits)

1:25:21.673 --> 1:25:24.410
(laughs)

1:25:24.410 --> 1:25:25.716
I love it.

1:25:25.716 --> 1:25:27.250
- Open the door.

1:25:27.250 --> 1:25:28.298
(laughs)

1:25:28.298 --> 1:25:30.381
(coughs)

1:25:31.250 --> 1:25:32.553
- You sure you don't want some coffee?

1:25:32.553 --> 1:25:34.253
- Open the fucking door!

1:25:39.775 --> 1:25:44.192
(beeps)
(door opens)

1:25:47.270 --> 1:25:48.103
- Seth.

1:25:51.900 --> 1:25:55.280
Thank you.

1:25:55.280 --> 1:25:56.813
You're welcome home, any time.

1:25:57.894 --> 1:26:00.852
(chuckles)

1:26:00.852 --> 1:26:03.269
(man laughs)

1:26:08.489 --> 1:26:10.989
(door closes)

1:26:11.893 --> 1:26:14.317
(insects buzzing)

1:26:14.317 --> 1:26:16.734
(Seth yells)

1:26:19.010 --> 1:26:22.260
(soft, dramatic music)

1:26:39.834 --> 1:26:42.180
(knocks)

1:26:42.180 --> 1:26:43.610
- What do you want?

1:26:43.610 --> 1:26:44.830
- Listen--
- No.

1:26:44.830 --> 1:26:45.663
-  Seth.

1:26:45.663 --> 1:26:48.330
- Abby, you are a fucking
bitch, you know that?

1:26:48.330 --> 1:26:49.490
What, did he send you up here to make sure

1:26:49.490 --> 1:26:51.430
I don't jump off?

1:26:51.430 --> 1:26:52.680
Maybe that's exactly what he wants,

1:26:52.680 --> 1:26:55.150
who the fuck knows anymore.

1:26:55.150 --> 1:26:56.649
- He's asleep.

1:26:56.649 --> 1:26:57.648
It's just me.

1:26:57.648 --> 1:26:58.570
- "It's just me."

1:26:58.570 --> 1:27:00.300
Stop with the fuckin'
damsel in distress act,

1:27:00.300 --> 1:27:01.490
it's not gonna work.

1:27:01.490 --> 1:27:04.063
- No offense Seth, but you're not my type.

1:27:06.240 --> 1:27:07.590
- What would've happened
if I just went for it

1:27:07.590 --> 1:27:08.976
tonight in the bathroom?

1:27:08.976 --> 1:27:10.324
- I don't know.

1:27:10.324 --> 1:27:11.680
That's kind of the whole point.

1:27:11.680 --> 1:27:14.343
It's like a choose your
own adventure book.

1:27:15.450 --> 1:27:16.416
- What is it?

1:27:17.155 --> 1:27:19.430
What do you fuckin' want from me?

1:27:19.430 --> 1:27:22.268
- I was actually wondering
if you had any notes.

1:27:22.268 --> 1:27:23.730
- Notes?

1:27:23.730 --> 1:27:25.610
- It's our first time
doing a Watcher Experience

1:27:25.610 --> 1:27:26.640
at this scale.

1:27:27.310 --> 1:27:28.670
We'd welcome your feedback.

1:27:28.670 --> 1:27:30.930
- Yeah, cut the shit and get a new job.

1:27:30.930 --> 1:27:33.185
Somebody died because of you.

1:27:33.185 --> 1:27:34.785
- He knew what he signed up for.

1:27:35.820 --> 1:27:38.353
Did the naked piano playing provide pathos

1:27:38.353 --> 1:27:40.880
or was it just goofy?

1:27:40.880 --> 1:27:42.880
Did we incentivize you enough?

1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:46.880
More sex, money, social interaction?

1:27:46.880 --> 1:27:48.450
We're still working on
the variables in the

1:27:48.450 --> 1:27:51.143
reward system, but I'm--
- Abby, please shut up!

1:27:56.728 --> 1:27:57.819
- Here.

1:28:00.734 --> 1:28:01.812
- No.

1:28:01.812 --> 1:28:02.860
No. No!

1:28:02.860 --> 1:28:04.220
- I'm not going through
this song and dance

1:28:04.220 --> 1:28:05.240
with you again, Seth.

1:28:05.240 --> 1:28:06.640
Just take the money.

1:28:06.640 --> 1:28:07.640
You won the game.

1:28:07.640 --> 1:28:09.470
- This was all a fucking joke.

1:28:09.470 --> 1:28:10.565
- Not to Richard.

1:28:15.528 --> 1:28:16.778
One more thing.

1:28:19.610 --> 1:28:22.610
If you invest that money
right, we have a lot of options

1:28:22.610 --> 1:28:24.330
that can make themselves available to you.

1:28:24.330 --> 1:28:25.333
- Yeah, no thanks.

1:28:26.950 --> 1:28:27.943
- Think about it.

1:28:29.851 --> 1:28:32.601
(birds chirping)

1:28:33.659 --> 1:28:35.473
- Why did you get involved in this shit?

1:28:38.970 --> 1:28:41.720
- There's only so much you
can do with a BA in theater.

1:28:45.462 --> 1:28:48.712
(soft, dramatic music)

1:30:00.078 --> 1:30:03.328
(soft, dramatic music)

1:31:00.264 --> 1:31:03.514
(soft, dramatic music)

1:31:17.874 --> 1:31:19.077
-  And
I just have to think,

1:31:19.077 --> 1:31:20.503
the world that they're living
in and I guess the world

1:31:20.503 --> 1:31:22.047
that we're living in,
is that even a question

1:31:22.047 --> 1:31:25.283
we can answer, I mean, who are we?

1:31:26.294 --> 1:31:27.127
Really?

1:31:33.340 --> 1:31:37.423
(synth pop music)
