00:45.374 --> 00:47.898
(crowd screaming)

00:51.331 --> 00:53.281
You can take him!

01:02.872 --> 01:06.273
- There you go! Trounce him!
- Get him!

01:06.393 --> 01:07.751
Edna.

01:07.785 --> 01:10.587
I had no idea you had such
a passion for wrestling.

01:10.795 --> 01:13.378
Oh, I don't. I merely accompany Simon.

01:13.393 --> 01:15.137
Go, Randolph, go!

01:15.675 --> 01:17.643
Go, Gladiator!

01:24.820 --> 01:27.875
- Ha! Ha! Ha!
- (Crowd booing)

01:30.344 --> 01:34.024
You can never beat me,
Gladiator! You're nothing!

01:34.034 --> 01:36.676
I am the greatest wrestler

01:36.796 --> 01:39.414
there ever was!

01:40.230 --> 01:42.097
Rubbish! Boo!

01:42.104 --> 01:45.464
A particularly ugly
crowd this evening, I see.

01:46.798 --> 01:48.804
- The gall.
- It's low.

01:48.809 --> 01:51.336
You people don't deserve
to watch the likes of me.

01:51.544 --> 01:54.041
Ladies and gentlemen, once again,

01:54.440 --> 01:55.997
I am forced

01:56.031 --> 01:57.999
to crown Handsome Randolph

01:58.119 --> 01:59.868
as champion!

01:59.902 --> 02:02.336
- (crowd booing)
- Rubbish.

02:02.372 --> 02:07.157
Can no one relieve us of
this dark-hearted champion?

02:07.655 --> 02:09.518
- Anyone?
- Right here!

02:09.536 --> 02:12.409
- We have a challenger here!
- Edna, are you crazy?

02:12.414 --> 02:14.475
- I'll be killed!
- Don't be a coward,

02:14.505 --> 02:16.614
- I'm sure you can best him.
- I'm not being a coward,

02:16.651 --> 02:19.597
look at the size of these
brutes. I wouldn't last 2 minutes.

02:21.706 --> 02:23.373
Edna, Simon,

02:23.729 --> 02:25.580
- look at that.
- My God, sir,

02:27.123 --> 02:29.398
who are you, sir?

02:31.139 --> 02:33.565
An unknown challenger!

02:35.941 --> 02:38.238
Handsome Randolph,

02:38.273 --> 02:41.175
- are you prepared?
- A man who

02:41.209 --> 02:44.034
buries his face with a mask like that

02:44.071 --> 02:46.277
must be especially ugly!

02:46.732 --> 02:49.807
He doesn't know that. He doesn't know that.

03:11.139 --> 03:12.916
That was illegal!

03:13.406 --> 03:14.939
That is not allowed!

03:18.407 --> 03:20.848
(bell ringing)

03:23.203 --> 03:24.925
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:25.045 --> 03:27.919
our nameless, faceless...

03:28.039 --> 03:30.108
champion!

03:32.726 --> 03:35.042
That was an illegal maneuver!

03:35.243 --> 03:37.254
I'll be back, McAllister.

03:37.292 --> 03:39.659
You haven't seen the last of me!

03:42.150 --> 03:45.009
Boo! Get out of there, Randolph!

03:46.569 --> 03:47.945
Here he is.

03:47.977 --> 03:49.945
One more time.

03:49.979 --> 03:52.748
The new champion!

03:53.970 --> 03:56.418
Ha! Ha! Ha!

03:56.452 --> 03:58.920
- Good lord!
- Where's mother?

03:58.955 --> 04:01.011
She's off trying to secure

04:01.049 --> 04:03.524
a souvenir poster for
her "wrestling scrapbook".

04:03.559 --> 04:06.091
I had no idea. Do you
have all your autographs?

04:06.530 --> 04:09.730
Nearly all. The Cossack, The Gladiator.

04:09.765 --> 04:11.732
Vurugu.

04:12.131 --> 04:14.822
I'm still missing my
favourite, Handsome Randolph.

04:14.841 --> 04:16.656
Handsome Randolph. Has he not come out yet?

04:16.656 --> 04:18.098
He hasn't.

04:18.505 --> 04:19.971
Wait.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.431
Excuse us.

04:23.459 --> 04:25.458
Dear God.

04:26.063 --> 04:28.359
Simon, wait there.

04:29.849 --> 04:31.991
Is he all right?

04:32.986 --> 04:36.041
Simon, go next door to Murphy's
Tavern. There will be constables there.

04:36.161 --> 04:38.073
What do I tell them?

04:38.524 --> 04:40.929
Tell them Handsome
Randolph Henderson is dead.

04:46.679 --> 04:48.684
And then he fell backwards,

04:48.685 --> 04:51.093
driving Handsome Randolph's
head directly into the mat.

04:51.213 --> 04:53.009
It's a wonder he survived.

04:53.473 --> 04:55.011
He didn't, George.

04:55.225 --> 04:58.320
Well, Mr. Henderson perished
eventually, yes, but at the time

04:58.321 --> 05:00.486
he jumped to his feet, he vowed revenge.

05:00.842 --> 05:03.468
It likely that blow to the
head was the cause of death.

05:03.588 --> 05:05.675
Emily, he didn't die
for another 45 minutes.

05:05.693 --> 05:08.615
Sometimes a serious head
injury seems harmless at first,

05:08.830 --> 05:11.559
but the brain can swell
after the fact, proving fatal.

05:11.928 --> 05:13.524
So the masked man did kill him.

05:13.526 --> 05:15.945
I'll have to cut open
the skull to be sure, but

05:16.065 --> 05:17.514
I do believe that to be the case.

05:18.730 --> 05:20.151
Thank you, Dr. Grace.

05:21.694 --> 05:23.281
So an accidental death then?

05:23.401 --> 05:24.824
It's a dangerous sport.

05:24.944 --> 05:27.493
I've done damage to men myself
in the ring back in my day.

05:27.542 --> 05:30.145
Yes, but sir, this maneuver
is particularly violent.

05:30.315 --> 05:31.975
Was it against the rules?

05:32.197 --> 05:34.367
Catch wrestling, Murdoch.
There are no rules.

05:34.422 --> 05:37.927
No balls, racquets or doings to get
in the way. Just man against man.

05:38.216 --> 05:40.436
Well then, if it wasn't
against the rules of the sport,

05:40.456 --> 05:42.034
I suspect it isn't against the law.

05:42.065 --> 05:44.861
Sir, if a man brought a
pistol into a wrestling ring

05:44.862 --> 05:47.155
and fired on his opponent, surely
that would be considered murder.

05:47.275 --> 05:49.929
Well, yes George. But then
his intent would be clear.

05:50.212 --> 05:52.112
Do you suspect murderous intent?

05:52.232 --> 05:53.711
I can't be certain, but

05:54.080 --> 05:56.072
I'm asking permission
to look into it further.

05:57.056 --> 05:58.854
Murdoch? What do you think?

05:59.645 --> 06:01.193
I think Constable Crabtree

06:01.194 --> 06:03.592
should be encouraged
to follow his instincts.

06:03.918 --> 06:05.745
Thank you, sir.

06:08.433 --> 06:10.923
You must be pleased to
be rid of the cast, Julia.

06:10.972 --> 06:12.079
Goodness, yes.

06:12.104 --> 06:13.647
And William's relieved to not have to write

06:13.648 --> 06:15.422
my correspondence any longer.

06:15.984 --> 06:18.776
Ladies, my apologies for my tardiness.

06:18.896 --> 06:21.362
I've brought a guest, Miss Jean Hamilton.

06:24.887 --> 06:27.601
Miss Hamilton. We've actually met.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.246
We have indeed.

06:29.997 --> 06:31.583
Delighted to join your cause.

06:31.946 --> 06:34.652
The Temperance movement is committed
to the fight for women's rights.

06:34.772 --> 06:36.853
We welcome anyone who supports our aims.

06:36.877 --> 06:40.047
Then I'm sure you will agree
with Miss Hamilton's proposal.

06:40.277 --> 06:42.823
- Proposal?
- In exchange for our support,

06:42.854 --> 06:44.852
Miss Haile will promise
to represent the interests

06:44.877 --> 06:46.162
of the Temperance movement.

06:46.500 --> 06:49.144
And does Miss Haile agree
to represent those interests?

06:49.174 --> 06:50.071
I do.

06:50.527 --> 06:52.384
The aim of the Temperance movement

06:52.427 --> 06:54.499
is to protect women and families

06:54.696 --> 06:57.765
who often suffer the consequences
of the excesses of drink.

06:57.885 --> 07:01.012
It is also a movement that
eliminates individual freedoms.

07:01.406 --> 07:03.552
Equality between men
and women is not achieved

07:03.595 --> 07:05.838
by removing rights already held by men.

07:06.048 --> 07:09.191
May I remind you that the Temperance
movement has great influence

07:09.603 --> 07:11.143
and many followers.

07:11.367 --> 07:14.307
Ladies, I will leave you to consider.

07:17.768 --> 07:19.287
Surely this isn't an option.

07:19.330 --> 07:22.626
We all know the kinds of things Miss
Hamilton and her Temperance League oppose.

07:22.639 --> 07:24.040
We must at least consider it.

07:24.059 --> 07:26.296
If there is a chance that
we can win this election,

07:26.308 --> 07:28.092
I for one want to take it.

07:32.098 --> 07:35.701
â™ª

07:43.286 --> 07:45.279
Excuse me, sir. I'm George Crabtree,

07:45.310 --> 07:47.278
I'm with the Toronto Constabulary.

07:49.478 --> 07:50.904
I saw you wrestle last night.

07:50.916 --> 07:52.570
Can I ask you a couple of questions?

07:52.690 --> 07:54.021
He doesn't speak.

07:54.853 --> 07:56.179
Is he mute?

07:56.855 --> 07:58.331
We call him

07:59.512 --> 08:00.821
Vurugu.

08:01.830 --> 08:03.261
From parts unknown.

08:03.295 --> 08:05.993
He speaks no language but violence.

08:06.565 --> 08:09.166
I'm Victor McAllister,
the manager of this troupe.

08:09.286 --> 08:11.902
I take it you're here about last
night's unfortunate incident.

08:11.936 --> 08:12.959
I am indeed.

08:14.951 --> 08:16.267
You can go.

08:21.030 --> 08:23.247
Mr. Henderson was a...

08:23.730 --> 08:26.750
cherished friend to us
all. We mourn him dearly.

08:26.784 --> 08:29.033
Do you know the identity
of the man who he wrestled

08:29.087 --> 08:31.840
- just prior his death?
- No, I've never seen him before.

08:32.089 --> 08:34.890
At least, I don't think I
had. He was wearing a mask.

08:35.227 --> 08:36.105
Right.

08:36.297 --> 08:38.902
I will need to speak to the other
wrestlers who were present last night.

08:38.903 --> 08:40.453
Yes, yes, of course, they're just

08:40.501 --> 08:41.933
cooling down in the dressing room.

08:42.054 --> 08:43.000
Straight through there.

08:45.787 --> 08:47.264
One other question.

08:47.481 --> 08:49.906
The maneuver that he used to win the match.

08:50.138 --> 08:52.742
- Have you seen anything like that before?
- Never.

08:53.116 --> 08:54.592
I hope I never see it again.

08:55.114 --> 08:56.129
All done, Mr. Titus.

08:56.721 --> 09:00.091
I have seen this maneuver before.

09:01.117 --> 09:02.456
What's your name?

09:03.087 --> 09:03.915
Cossack.

09:04.035 --> 09:05.862
Your given name.

09:06.445 --> 09:08.309
Cossack.

09:10.782 --> 09:11.631
Right.

09:11.770 --> 09:14.305
- Where have you seen this maneuver before?
- In Russia.

09:14.618 --> 09:16.508
We fight to the death, you know.

09:17.026 --> 09:19.735
Do you think the man in the mask
intended to kill Mr. Henderson?

09:20.936 --> 09:23.972
Who knows what lies in
the heart of a masked man?

09:27.654 --> 09:30.333
Do you mind my asking
what you're drinking there?

09:30.732 --> 09:32.113
It's morphine.

09:32.466 --> 09:33.930
Dulls the pain.

09:34.050 --> 09:35.672
And you are?

09:37.608 --> 09:39.301
They call me the Solid Man.

09:39.421 --> 09:43.144
(cracking) That's, that's an apt moniker.

09:45.060 --> 09:47.493
And you knew the man in the mask?

09:48.070 --> 09:49.629
A local amateur, I heard.

09:49.811 --> 09:51.455
Think his name was Humber.

09:51.623 --> 09:53.213
Where did you hear his name?

09:56.924 --> 09:58.106
I don't know.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.330
Just heard the name.

10:05.349 --> 10:06.569
The rooming house.

10:06.825 --> 10:08.098
River Street.

10:12.452 --> 10:15.862
(knocking) Toronto
Constabulary. Is anybody home?

10:18.184 --> 10:20.234
Excuse me, sir, do you live here?

10:20.956 --> 10:24.137
Mr. Humber, I'm George Crabtree,
I'm with the Toronto... Stop!

10:24.349 --> 10:26.365
Mr. Humber!

10:33.607 --> 10:37.259
â™ª

10:38.441 --> 10:40.375
Give it up, Humber! You can't outrun me!

10:40.397 --> 10:42.443
I'm twice your size! How
are you going to arrest me?

10:42.492 --> 10:44.283
(impact)

10:46.635 --> 10:48.801
Twice my size and half the wit.

10:49.929 --> 10:51.796
The neighbourhood's coming up, Mr. Chilton.

10:51.839 --> 10:53.619
Rents must be a fortune these days.

10:53.865 --> 10:56.167
You're quite right, Inspector.
Tough luck for my tenants.

10:56.592 --> 10:58.437
- You own the building?
- I do.

10:59.254 --> 11:01.225
How does a barber end up
owning a whole building?

11:01.470 --> 11:03.483
Simple. I save 10 percent of my earnings

11:03.499 --> 11:05.105
and I never buy anything frivolous.

11:05.121 --> 11:07.386
Why put in new flooring when
you can throw down a rug?

11:07.422 --> 11:09.269
Ha! Tell that to my wife.

11:09.731 --> 11:11.952
Ha! How are you planning
for your future, Inspector?

11:12.382 --> 11:14.973
I put my extra money
in Margaret's cookie jar

11:15.011 --> 11:15.915
at the end of the month.

11:15.931 --> 11:18.244
A cookie jar? You have to invest.

11:18.277 --> 11:20.155
That money could be earning more money.

11:20.405 --> 11:22.342
- How much more?
- Leave it in my hands.

11:22.354 --> 11:24.970
By the time you retire, you'll
have a nice little nest-egg.

11:25.347 --> 11:26.985
Hum.

11:28.988 --> 11:30.767
I didn't kill him. He
walked out of the ring!

11:30.768 --> 11:33.250
Then why did you run when you
saw me outside your rooming house?

11:33.620 --> 11:35.628
- I've had bad luck with the law before.
- Mr. Humber,

11:35.658 --> 11:37.179
I have other wrestlers on record

11:37.201 --> 11:38.960
saying that maneuver is designed to kill.

11:39.014 --> 11:40.431
And the city coroner will attest

11:40.452 --> 11:42.629
that even if Mr. Henderson
walked out of that ring

11:42.656 --> 11:43.896
on his own two legs,

11:43.945 --> 11:46.726
- it was that blow to his head that killed him.
- That's impossible!

11:46.846 --> 11:49.731
The maneuver is harmless. Randolph's
head didn't even touch the mat!

11:49.744 --> 11:52.622
Sit down, Mr. Humber. Sit down!

11:53.861 --> 11:55.249
What do you mean his
head didn't touch the mat?

11:55.276 --> 11:58.356
And why would someone use a harmless
maneuver in a wrestling match?

11:59.167 --> 12:01.164
Henderson and I had an arrangement.

12:01.474 --> 12:02.753
I do the maneuver

12:02.873 --> 12:04.479
and he acts like it dazed him.

12:04.952 --> 12:06.841
And then I take the championship.

12:08.769 --> 12:10.112
I think I know what
you're saying Mr. Humber,

12:10.150 --> 12:12.459
and I think the idea of Mr.
Henderson giving up his championship

12:12.468 --> 12:15.236
in a fake maneuver difficult to believe.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.888
I'm telling the truth.

12:18.851 --> 12:20.218
I couldn't have killed him.

12:22.373 --> 12:23.357
Alright.

12:23.674 --> 12:24.937
Lying is one thing.

12:24.945 --> 12:27.841
Attacking the integrity of
the great sport of wrestling,

12:27.894 --> 12:29.806
that is quite another. Lads,

12:29.926 --> 12:31.129
take him to the cells.

12:35.601 --> 12:38.488
Well, George, head trauma
was not the cause of death.

12:38.527 --> 12:41.257
In fact, he suffered no
injury to his head whatsoever.

12:42.006 --> 12:44.518
- He was telling the truth.
- Who's that?

12:44.888 --> 12:47.475
My suspect. He told me the
wrestling maneuver was fake.

12:48.158 --> 12:50.815
- How did he die?
- A lethal dose of morphine.

12:50.935 --> 12:53.270
Well, that makes sense.
All the wrestlers drink it.

12:53.390 --> 12:56.022
No, he didn't drink it. It was injected.

12:56.062 --> 12:58.739
And it was far too great a quantity
for it to have been an accident.

13:05.095 --> 13:06.724
<i> Well, it appears you
were right, George.</i>

13:06.746 --> 13:08.335
We have a murder on our hands.

13:08.605 --> 13:10.578
And this Humber bloke
had nothing to do with it?

13:10.774 --> 13:14.074
Mr. Henderson exited the
ring apparently in good health

13:14.100 --> 13:16.086
and was found dead 45 minutes later.

13:16.182 --> 13:18.947
The lethal injection must have been
administered somewhere in the interim.

13:19.067 --> 13:21.324
And I saw Mr. Henderson
walk directly from the ring

13:21.342 --> 13:22.356
into the dressing room.

13:22.383 --> 13:24.642
And Simon Brooks will attest
that he never came out.

13:24.762 --> 13:26.275
Then he must have been
killed in the dressing room.

13:26.497 --> 13:29.070
The question is, who else was in there?

13:43.113 --> 13:45.369
I don't see the appeal, George.

13:45.489 --> 13:46.797
Sir, you'd be surprised.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.856
A passion for wrestling

13:48.895 --> 13:50.963
can be the most unexpected places.

13:52.247 --> 13:53.749
Take Edna, for example.

13:53.936 --> 13:55.560
Who would have thought a sweet,

13:55.573 --> 13:57.499
demure young lady would find

13:59.136 --> 14:01.192
two muscle-bound men

14:01.227 --> 14:03.708
locked in fierce combat stimulating?

14:04.008 --> 14:05.632
But she does.

14:06.765 --> 14:09.386
Perhaps you should think
about bulking up too, George.

14:09.956 --> 14:11.776
- To keep pace.
- Sir.

14:13.801 --> 14:15.674
Good evening, Constable.

14:15.835 --> 14:18.107
- I hope you're enjoying the show.
- Yes. Mr. McAllister,

14:18.155 --> 14:19.588
this is Detective William Murdoch.

14:19.775 --> 14:21.365
We need to ask you a couple of questions.

14:21.379 --> 14:23.176
I'm busy running a show, I'm afraid.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.349
We need you to account
for your whereabouts after

14:25.367 --> 14:26.788
last night's final match, sir.

14:26.798 --> 14:29.196
Really, Detective, now is not the time.

14:29.216 --> 14:32.002
You were out back with me,
loading gear. Remember, sir?

14:34.530 --> 14:37.362
- Oh, yes, that's right.
- And who might you be?

14:37.411 --> 14:38.915
Shane Tindall, equipment man.

14:39.828 --> 14:40.831
And you, sir?

14:40.951 --> 14:42.447
Sir, he can't...

14:42.750 --> 14:46.397
I'll explain. Mr. Tindall I've also seen
you wrestling though, isn't that correct?

14:46.517 --> 14:48.623
I often get in the ring
when we're short a man.

14:48.640 --> 14:50.699
Yes, but he doesn't last long.

14:51.127 --> 14:52.420
You'll excuse us, gentlemen.

15:00.275 --> 15:02.878
Yes, I was in the dressing
room last night. What of it?

15:03.247 --> 15:05.219
Were you and Mr. Henderson ever alone

15:05.239 --> 15:06.870
in the dressing room at any point?

15:07.922 --> 15:11.116
I don't think so, but I
can't say I remember clearly.

15:11.151 --> 15:13.398
My senses were dulled.

15:14.143 --> 15:16.167
Do you ever inject your medication?

15:16.192 --> 15:16.795
No.

15:16.965 --> 15:18.223
I don't care for needles.

15:18.777 --> 15:21.415
You had a rivalry with
Mr. Henderson, did you not?

15:22.037 --> 15:24.928
- What is this about?
- Just prior to his death,

15:25.569 --> 15:27.383
the victim beat

15:27.717 --> 15:30.173
and verbally insulted
you in front of a crowd.

15:30.293 --> 15:32.760
- Yes, but that doesn't mean that I...
- That's quite enough,

15:32.880 --> 15:33.657
Detective.

15:34.555 --> 15:36.687
I did not give you permission
to speak to my employees.

15:36.924 --> 15:38.035
Mr. McAllister,

15:38.335 --> 15:40.209
we're conducting a murder investigation.

15:40.230 --> 15:41.686
There are questions
that need to be answered.

15:41.706 --> 15:42.445
That may be.

15:42.448 --> 15:44.486
But they will not be
answered by my employees.

15:45.346 --> 15:47.966
Carelessly positing
accusations inspires ill-will,

15:47.983 --> 15:49.227
and I will not have this.

15:49.882 --> 15:53.487
Each of us hereby invokes his
right to remain unspeaking.

15:53.607 --> 15:54.581
You two, get out.

15:57.678 --> 15:58.727
The Gladiator,

15:58.904 --> 16:00.099
Max Titus,

16:00.597 --> 16:03.481
was in the dressing room
around the time of the murder.

16:03.739 --> 16:06.705
He also had a very public
grudge against the victim.

16:06.758 --> 16:09.130
Not to mention he's holding
a bottle of the murder weapon.

16:09.158 --> 16:11.575
- Now hang on. I didn't do it!
- Max,

16:12.111 --> 16:13.301
I remind you to be silent.

16:13.605 --> 16:14.682
George, arrest him.

16:14.832 --> 16:17.298
I had nothing to do with it!

16:17.418 --> 16:20.371
- Remain unspeaking!
- I don't hold a grudge against Randolph.

16:20.430 --> 16:22.642
- That's not what I saw.
- It was an act!

16:22.697 --> 16:24.882
I don't hate him. We grew up together,

16:24.892 --> 16:26.568
been wrestling since we were kids.

16:27.940 --> 16:30.047
- He's my best friend.
- Best friend

16:30.858 --> 16:33.109
and greatest rival?

16:35.787 --> 16:39.288
Their rivalry was not entirely sincere.

16:39.863 --> 16:41.580
So what, it was all an act?

16:41.646 --> 16:44.499
The competition, of course,
is legitimate. But the

16:44.743 --> 16:47.003
personal rivalry is merely a ruse

16:47.052 --> 16:49.818
to incite passion in the spectators.

16:50.476 --> 16:52.259
If that's the case, Mr. McAllister,

16:52.273 --> 16:54.708
why not let your employee speak of it?

16:54.828 --> 16:56.638
It's not public knowledge, Detective.

16:56.927 --> 16:59.425
People might question Mr.
Titus's legitimacy as a wrestler

17:00.191 --> 17:02.361
and the legitimacy of my entire business.

17:07.035 --> 17:11.220
â™ª

17:12.637 --> 17:15.017
He wasn't in the dressing room.

17:15.278 --> 17:17.469
I count six, seven,

17:18.098 --> 17:19.569
- and these two weren't...
- Constable.

17:19.820 --> 17:20.573
Detective.

17:21.252 --> 17:22.252
Thanks for seeing me.

17:22.419 --> 17:25.348
Mr. Francis, thank you for coming
in. Sir, this is the Solid Man.

17:26.366 --> 17:27.700
- Archibald Francis.
- (cracking)

17:27.717 --> 17:29.626
Detective William Murdoch.

17:29.953 --> 17:31.120
Nice to meet you.

17:31.701 --> 17:35.049
I see you are unaccompanied
by Mr. McAllister.

17:35.659 --> 17:36.826
He doesn't know I'm here.

17:37.400 --> 17:39.220
I'm sick about what happened.

17:39.480 --> 17:40.410
It's not right.

17:40.629 --> 17:43.397
Do you have any information regarding
Handsome Randolph Henderson's death?

17:43.575 --> 17:44.668
There were rumours

17:44.839 --> 17:46.082
about Randolph

17:46.249 --> 17:47.475
and the Cossack.

17:49.697 --> 17:51.313
And the Cossack's wife.

17:51.620 --> 17:52.853
Oh, I see.

17:53.271 --> 17:55.260
What happened exactly?

17:55.807 --> 17:57.510
I mean, between the two men, not...

17:57.830 --> 17:58.774
I'm not sure,

17:59.464 --> 18:01.164
but I know they hated each other.

18:01.983 --> 18:03.488
(glass breaking)

18:13.727 --> 18:15.949
Detective Murdoch, Toronto Constabulary.

18:16.322 --> 18:17.988
We'd like a moment of your time, please.

18:21.917 --> 18:23.666
I'm not supposed to be talking to you.

18:25.166 --> 18:28.026
We understand that you
disliked Mr. Henderson.

18:28.146 --> 18:28.966
Dislike?

18:29.419 --> 18:30.791
He was garbage.

18:30.948 --> 18:31.829
<i>Kabolsh.</i>

18:33.110 --> 18:35.841
He became familiar with your wife?

18:35.901 --> 18:36.970
Who the hell told you...

18:38.063 --> 18:40.268
Please to leave my wife out of this.

18:40.388 --> 18:42.258
I know nothing of Randolph's death.

18:42.293 --> 18:43.784
I don't think you're being truthful, sir.

18:43.797 --> 18:45.337
In fact, I don't even think you're Russian.

18:46.176 --> 18:48.409
Of course I am Russian! Ask anyone.

18:48.681 --> 18:49.374
Sir.

18:50.485 --> 18:52.168
Where in Russia are you from?

18:52.195 --> 18:53.115
Moscow.

18:53.369 --> 18:53.935
Ah.

18:54.055 --> 18:55.268
Well then, what's the name

18:55.281 --> 18:57.131
of the river that runs through Moscow?

18:58.693 --> 18:59.675
Moscow

19:00.361 --> 19:02.113
has no river, Detective.

19:02.534 --> 19:05.836
The river that runs through
Moscow is the Moscow River.

19:06.021 --> 19:07.766
Anyone from there would know that.

19:08.486 --> 19:09.898
I'm done with this interview.

19:10.222 --> 19:11.302
I'm glad Randolph is dead,

19:11.337 --> 19:13.367
but I didn't kill him.
It's all I have to say.

19:17.536 --> 19:18.888
I hate vodka.

19:19.404 --> 19:21.329
The only constant in this investigation

19:21.350 --> 19:23.158
is that each wrestler has proved a fraud.

19:23.444 --> 19:24.067
True.

19:24.242 --> 19:25.576
The Cossack isn't Russian

19:25.603 --> 19:27.634
and the chief rivals were actually friends.

19:27.641 --> 19:29.825
And in our championship
match the other night,

19:29.898 --> 19:32.030
it involved a fake maneuver

19:32.062 --> 19:34.267
- and a prearranged outcome.
- So? What of it?

19:34.319 --> 19:37.589
Sir, as much as it pains me to say, it's
quite possible the entire sport is fake.

19:37.640 --> 19:38.690
Outlandish!

19:38.975 --> 19:41.159
Wrestling is a sport
of honour and integrity.

19:41.417 --> 19:42.842
It dates back to the Egyptians.

19:42.901 --> 19:43.967
Greco-Roman.

19:45.737 --> 19:47.148
Be that as it may,

19:47.179 --> 19:48.939
how does it bear on the case, George?

19:48.946 --> 19:51.492
Well, sir, if each man is a
fake, then what about Vurugu?

19:51.862 --> 19:53.475
- The one who doesn't speak.
- Right.

19:53.513 --> 19:56.187
They call him the "Wild
Man From Parts Unknown".

19:56.250 --> 19:57.936
But I discovered reports, sirs,

19:57.981 --> 19:59.723
about a wrestler from Indianapolis.

20:00.217 --> 20:01.076
Joe Jefferson.

20:01.196 --> 20:03.230
Now, he was almost lynched by an angry mob

20:03.247 --> 20:06.171
in Baltimore three years ago
and hasn't been seen since.

20:06.439 --> 20:08.714
You believe this Jefferson and Mr. Vurugu

20:08.728 --> 20:09.655
to be one and the same?

20:09.721 --> 20:11.790
Sir, a week after the
incident in Baltimore,

20:11.910 --> 20:14.448
Vurugu wrestles his first
match in Philadelphia.

20:15.833 --> 20:17.052
Well then, perhaps you should have

20:17.073 --> 20:19.069
a conversation with this Mr. Vurugu.

20:19.189 --> 20:20.679
- I will.
- (Phone ringing)

20:22.483 --> 20:24.889
It seems somebody's insistent
on speaking with you, sir.

20:28.944 --> 20:31.100
Calm down, Margaret, just calm down.

20:31.644 --> 20:34.603
No, the cookie jar hasn't
been stolen, I've taken it.

20:35.304 --> 20:37.064
We need to plan for our future.

20:37.235 --> 20:39.255
So I've invested our savings with someone.

20:39.656 --> 20:40.394
My barber.

20:40.610 --> 20:42.066
Yes, my barber.

20:42.411 --> 20:44.822
No, no, no, this won't be like last time.

20:44.942 --> 20:46.153
He's a real investor.

20:46.539 --> 20:48.075
Maybe he just likes being a barber.

20:48.335 --> 20:50.431
Well, he owns an entire
building for one thing.

20:50.734 --> 20:52.061
Because he said so!

20:52.479 --> 20:53.398
No, Margaret,

20:53.970 --> 20:55.871
he did not show me the land deed.

20:56.657 --> 20:57.902
Why would he lie about that?

20:58.180 --> 20:59.156
I'm a policeman.

20:59.936 --> 21:00.567
Fine.

21:01.090 --> 21:01.696
Fine.

21:02.159 --> 21:02.674
Fine.

21:02.849 --> 21:03.876
I'll get it back.

21:05.339 --> 21:06.495
(Sighing)

21:06.868 --> 21:08.885
Trouble and bloody strife,
that's what you are.

21:13.013 --> 21:14.055
Vurugu?

21:15.758 --> 21:16.859
Or is it Mr. Jefferson?

21:17.415 --> 21:19.565
Please, I'm not supposed
to be speaking with you.

21:19.634 --> 21:21.146
You need to answer a few questions.

21:21.173 --> 21:24.427
- I don't want to lose my job.
- One of your colleagues was murdered, Mr. Jefferson?

21:24.493 --> 21:26.256
The killer needs to be brought to justice.

21:26.259 --> 21:27.804
I don't know who killed him, I swear.

21:28.013 --> 21:29.337
But I was not involved.

21:29.546 --> 21:31.121
You know something. A suspect,

21:31.149 --> 21:32.580
a rumour, a motive...

21:32.700 --> 21:33.959
If you and your colleagues remain silent,

21:33.970 --> 21:35.161
we'll never discover the truth.

21:38.017 --> 21:38.790
Cleveland.

21:39.974 --> 21:40.674
Cleveland?

21:41.782 --> 21:43.234
What happened in Cleveland?

21:44.833 --> 21:46.696
Temperance is a given, of course.

21:47.086 --> 21:49.845
It must be front and centre in
any discussion of your platform.

21:50.444 --> 21:52.227
- Very well.
- And the streetcars

21:52.245 --> 21:54.630
- cannot run on Sundays.
- The streetcars?

21:55.442 --> 21:58.155
I thought our city had long
since moved past that debate.

21:58.275 --> 22:00.827
We are most certainly
not "past" the debate.

22:01.200 --> 22:03.136
How do you expect people to get around?

22:03.379 --> 22:04.125
I don't.

22:04.768 --> 22:06.123
Sunday is the Lord's day.

22:06.607 --> 22:07.955
What about those who rely

22:07.973 --> 22:09.484
on the streetcar to get to church?

22:12.355 --> 22:13.996
Shanks' pony, like the rest of us!

22:20.714 --> 22:21.400
Sir,

22:21.923 --> 22:22.867
I've been to the archives,

22:22.899 --> 22:25.515
these are all newspapers from
Cleveland and I'm looking for

22:25.553 --> 22:27.274
anything pertaining to
the sport of wrestling.

22:28.110 --> 22:30.742
Based on Mr. Vurugu's
mysterious suggestion.

22:30.802 --> 22:32.139
Yes sir, and as it turns out,

22:32.259 --> 22:33.742
there was a match a couple of months ago

22:34.020 --> 22:35.047
where a wrestler

22:35.096 --> 22:36.451
who was just watching

22:36.571 --> 22:37.945
decided the match was going unfairly,

22:37.959 --> 22:40.271
so he interceded by getting into the ring,

22:40.578 --> 22:42.107
creating a two on one situation.

22:42.227 --> 22:43.340
And then sir, another wrestler,

22:43.343 --> 22:44.828
who'd also just been a spectator,

22:44.856 --> 22:46.200
decided he'll even the odds,

22:46.214 --> 22:47.774
so he jumped in the ring as well.

22:48.004 --> 22:50.328
And all four of them just
started go at it at once, sir.

22:50.448 --> 22:52.111
It would have been a total debacle.

22:53.209 --> 22:55.160
That doesn't have anything
to do with the case, but

22:55.197 --> 22:56.803
I surely would have liked to have seen it.

22:57.225 --> 22:59.241
Did you discover anything
pertinent, George?

22:59.252 --> 23:00.213
Yes, sir, I did.

23:00.516 --> 23:03.306
Last year, when Victor McAllister's
troupe was in Cleveland,

23:03.491 --> 23:05.783
a man was killed in the ring, a wrestler

23:06.034 --> 23:07.166
by the name of

23:07.668 --> 23:09.716
Lloyd "The Gentleman" Francis.

23:10.366 --> 23:11.331
Francis...

23:12.088 --> 23:14.452
- as is Archibald Francis?
- Sir,

23:14.491 --> 23:16.076
he was the Solid Man's father.

23:16.196 --> 23:18.037
And the other wrestler,
the man who killed him,

23:18.343 --> 23:20.040
was Handsome Randolph Henderson.

23:22.454 --> 23:23.308
Mr. Francis?

23:23.882 --> 23:25.004
Toronto Constabulary.

23:27.833 --> 23:28.989
Hum.

23:29.996 --> 23:31.591
Sir, thinking about it now,

23:31.651 --> 23:33.915
how could Vurugu be from parts unknown?

23:34.035 --> 23:36.543
I mean whatever parts of the
jungle they went in to find him,

23:36.614 --> 23:38.605
those parts would now be
known, don't you think?

23:39.678 --> 23:41.278
I suppose so, George.

23:41.398 --> 23:43.793
Assuming they went into
the the jungle to find him.

23:44.037 --> 23:46.292
Which they must have. I mean
he couldn't have just shown up

23:46.331 --> 23:48.294
at Union Station with a
string of bones around his neck

23:48.316 --> 23:49.771
and a human skull on his...

23:49.945 --> 23:50.646
Sir.

23:56.563 --> 23:57.913
A syringe?

23:58.509 --> 24:00.501
Perhaps the Solid Man is our killer.

24:00.503 --> 24:03.896
â™ª [dramatic]

24:04.701 --> 24:06.143
Mr. Francis,

24:06.875 --> 24:08.791
I understand you and your colleagues

24:08.804 --> 24:11.072
use morphine to dull the pain

24:11.192 --> 24:12.901
- following a match.
- That's right.

24:13.166 --> 24:16.619
And you choose to ingest
it rather than inject it.

24:17.085 --> 24:18.161
Yes.

24:19.778 --> 24:22.786
Constable Crabtree found this syringe

24:23.252 --> 24:24.323
in your bag,

24:24.493 --> 24:26.617
- in your room.
- That's not possible.

24:27.317 --> 24:28.895
We believe this to be the syringe

24:28.925 --> 24:31.708
that killed Mr. Henderson. It
has traces of morphine in it.

24:31.717 --> 24:32.936
I've been helping you.

24:33.428 --> 24:35.392
Now you're accusing me of murder?

24:35.512 --> 24:38.524
I suspect you've been
helping us only as a means

24:38.546 --> 24:40.614
- to hide the truth.
- You're wrong, Detective.

24:41.031 --> 24:42.234
Why would I do that?

24:42.486 --> 24:44.377
Lloyd "The Gentleman" Francis,

24:44.926 --> 24:45.810
your father,

24:46.607 --> 24:48.315
he died at the hands of Mr. Henderson.

24:48.644 --> 24:51.174
That was an accident.

24:51.541 --> 24:52.834
My father was old.

24:53.543 --> 24:54.936
He shouldn't have been wrestling.

24:55.001 --> 24:57.714
We know Mr. Henderson was
killed in the dressing room

24:57.744 --> 24:59.830
immediately following his last match.

24:59.913 --> 25:02.996
You are among very few
people who had access to him.

25:03.514 --> 25:05.356
I didn't go back to the dressing room.

25:05.822 --> 25:07.190
My match was first,

25:07.539 --> 25:09.393
I left directly after.

25:10.072 --> 25:11.505
Well, if that's the case, you won't mind

25:11.535 --> 25:14.893
- volunteering a sample of fingermarks.
- Not another word, Mr. Francis.

25:14.915 --> 25:16.885
You're under no obligation
to speak to these men.

25:17.075 --> 25:19.377
There won't be any fingermark
samples on offer, either.

25:19.948 --> 25:23.536
Mr. McAllister, your
employee claims innocence.

25:23.623 --> 25:24.754
Allow him to prove it.

25:24.803 --> 25:25.817
He doesn't have to prove anything.

25:25.848 --> 25:29.070
The onus is entirely on you,
Detective. Let's go, Archibald.

25:31.668 --> 25:32.615
Gentlemen.

25:41.940 --> 25:43.169
That bloody shyster.

25:48.031 --> 25:49.311
Bullocks.

25:50.512 --> 25:53.125
We'll need more convincing
evidence for a judge to force

25:53.138 --> 25:55.219
Mr. Francis to provide his fingermarks.

25:55.245 --> 25:58.611
Indeed sir, but it's entirely possible
the syringe was planted in his bag.

26:00.043 --> 26:02.699
Mr. Francis claims not to
have been in the dressing room.

26:03.243 --> 26:05.011
This could be verified if Mr. McAllister

26:05.037 --> 26:06.548
would let his wrestlers speak with us.

26:06.668 --> 26:07.978
Sir, there might be another way.

26:09.339 --> 26:10.579
I'll be right back.

26:17.947 --> 26:20.002
This is one I did of Handsome Randolph.

26:21.214 --> 26:22.308
They're all quite...

26:22.468 --> 26:23.614
vivid, Simon.

26:23.893 --> 26:24.621
Very good.

26:25.471 --> 26:27.746
Can you show me the
page with the autographs?

26:27.866 --> 26:28.742
Yeah.

26:29.153 --> 26:30.941
If we can identify The
Solid Man's autograph,

26:30.990 --> 26:33.629
we'll know that Mr. Francis was
indeed at the scene of the crime.

26:34.825 --> 26:35.713
Ah, here.

26:36.824 --> 26:37.671
That's the page.

26:39.225 --> 26:40.228
It isn't here.

26:40.990 --> 26:43.436
Mr. Francis' autograph isn't here.

26:43.467 --> 26:47.361
Simon, do you recall if The Solid
Man came out of the dressing room?

26:48.573 --> 26:49.521
He never did.

26:49.531 --> 26:51.357
That's why I don't have his signature.

26:51.520 --> 26:52.416
Are you certain?

26:52.536 --> 26:53.875
I would have noticed.

26:54.122 --> 26:55.467
Have you seen the size of him?

26:58.063 --> 26:59.955
What's this drawing here?

27:00.387 --> 27:02.351
That's Vurugu's signature.

27:02.425 --> 27:03.954
He doesn't speak.

27:04.748 --> 27:06.246
What about this one, sir?

27:08.169 --> 27:09.563
'The Masked Marauder?'

27:11.754 --> 27:12.820
Simon,

27:13.485 --> 27:15.895
was The Masked Marauder wearing his mask

27:15.920 --> 27:18.006
when he came out of the
dressing room and signed this?

27:18.340 --> 27:19.661
Yes,

27:19.781 --> 27:21.301
he didn't have much time for me, though.

27:21.855 --> 27:23.668
So Mr. Humber was there after all.

27:35.201 --> 27:36.768
Ah. Thank you, George.

27:36.988 --> 27:37.956
Simon,

27:38.548 --> 27:40.896
could this be the man who signed your book

27:40.913 --> 27:42.480
as The Masked Marauder?

27:43.518 --> 27:45.459
Oh, his mask is different.

27:45.939 --> 27:47.199
Aside from the mask.

27:47.367 --> 27:48.864
His body's different too.

27:49.533 --> 27:50.767
It's not the same man.

27:51.011 --> 27:52.523
Are you quite certain, Simon?

27:52.700 --> 27:53.645
I am sure of it.

27:54.265 --> 27:55.951
This mask is itching my face.

27:57.404 --> 27:58.376
Thank you, Simon.

27:58.435 --> 27:59.824
You can go home now.

28:00.040 --> 28:01.730
Or I could stay and help some more.

28:03.828 --> 28:05.792
I'll get him home, sir. Come on, Simon.

28:09.478 --> 28:10.888
Thank you, Mr. Humber.

28:12.274 --> 28:13.716
Please have a seat.

28:17.474 --> 28:19.188
What did you do with your mask

28:19.240 --> 28:20.135
after the match?

28:20.255 --> 28:22.198
I gave it back to Mr. McAllister.

28:23.668 --> 28:25.131
You gave it back?

28:26.260 --> 28:28.761
Is that to say that Mr. McAllister

28:28.771 --> 28:31.056
gave you the mask to wear in the match?

28:31.176 --> 28:33.014
Yes, he told me to wear it when I

28:33.028 --> 28:34.438
challenged Handsome Randolph.

28:34.985 --> 28:37.025
I wouldn't know where to get such a thing.

28:38.006 --> 28:40.195
Mr. Humber, if I have this correct,

28:40.791 --> 28:43.225
your match with Handsome
Randolph was not fixed

28:43.264 --> 28:47.047
by yourself or by Handsome
Randolph, but by Victor McAllister?

28:47.270 --> 28:48.207
Yeah.

28:48.255 --> 28:50.496
Mr. McAllister arranges everything.

28:50.747 --> 28:54.143
He controls the show right
down to the concession snacks.

28:55.023 --> 28:56.907
So if you gave the mask to him

28:57.315 --> 28:58.540
after the event,

28:58.875 --> 29:02.295
am I to presume that Victor McAllister
was in possession of the mask

29:02.329 --> 29:04.071
immediately after the match?

29:04.394 --> 29:06.016
(sighing)

29:06.358 --> 29:09.430
Please don't make me talk about
Mr. McAllister anymore, sir.

29:12.990 --> 29:13.923
Thank you.

29:18.250 --> 29:18.975
Julia.

29:20.065 --> 29:20.790
Emily,

29:20.874 --> 29:22.061
what brings you by?

29:23.029 --> 29:24.600
I don't think we should
be aligning our cause

29:24.610 --> 29:25.735
with the Temperance Movement.

29:27.324 --> 29:29.236
Emily, this is going to provide exposure

29:29.257 --> 29:31.128
that would otherwise
take us years to achieve.

29:31.142 --> 29:33.521
Jean Hamilton is as backwards
thinking as many of those

29:33.542 --> 29:35.290
denying us the vote in the first place.

29:35.325 --> 29:38.056
It's true we have some principal
differences from Miss Hamilton,

29:38.176 --> 29:40.383
but her support may win us the election.

29:40.731 --> 29:42.240
How can we pass up that opportunity?

29:42.309 --> 29:44.117
Well, if that's the compromise, I

29:44.152 --> 29:46.336
think I would rather continue
without the vote altogether.

29:47.911 --> 29:49.991
Emily, I hadn't realized
you were this impassioned.

29:50.976 --> 29:52.711
Are these your words or Lillian's?

29:53.805 --> 29:56.208
I'm as capable of
independent thought as you.

29:56.328 --> 29:58.267
- Emily, I didn't mean to suggest...
- Didn't you?

30:04.053 --> 30:05.586
This will only be a few minutes.

30:05.610 --> 30:08.306
Let's make it quick, Detective.
I have fans to entertain.

30:08.703 --> 30:10.411
Very well, Mr. McAllister.

30:10.811 --> 30:13.271
Did you murder Randolph Henderson?

30:14.302 --> 30:15.790
That's what you brought me in to ask?

30:17.772 --> 30:20.336
- No. That's absurd.
- Well then,

30:20.555 --> 30:21.868
you won't mind providing us

30:21.879 --> 30:23.990
with a handwriting sample to that effect.

30:28.595 --> 30:30.780
I will not be providing
samples of any kind.

30:31.017 --> 30:33.398
Not handwriting and...

30:34.049 --> 30:36.414
most certainly not fingermarks.

30:49.213 --> 30:50.533
A sporting effort, Detective.

30:52.309 --> 30:53.337
Constable.

30:55.360 --> 30:57.078
It didn't work, George.

30:57.541 --> 30:59.035
Between the handwriting, the pen

30:59.042 --> 31:00.401
and the door knob, I thought...

31:02.509 --> 31:03.536
Sir, Mr. McAllister

31:03.585 --> 31:05.115
was sitting very close to the table.

31:05.742 --> 31:07.664
He wouldn't have been able
to get into that position

31:07.817 --> 31:09.605
- without adjusting his chair.
- ... His chair.

31:10.242 --> 31:11.737
Very good, George.

31:18.720 --> 31:19.856
It's a match, sir.

31:20.163 --> 31:22.945
Well then, I believe we have
more questions for Mr. McAllister.

31:23.189 --> 31:24.084
Quite.

31:26.316 --> 31:27.515
I'll bring him in.

31:31.426 --> 31:33.035
This is beyond tiresome.

31:34.676 --> 31:35.477
This

31:35.662 --> 31:36.714
is the syringe

31:36.743 --> 31:38.886
used to administer the
fatal dose of morphine

31:38.905 --> 31:40.232
that killed Mr. Henderson.

31:41.356 --> 31:45.207
And this syringe has your
fingermarks all over it.

31:45.831 --> 31:47.579
You'll recall that I didn't
fall for your little pen trick.

31:48.532 --> 31:50.801
You don't have my fingermarks
from which to cross reference.

31:51.071 --> 31:52.272
But we do.

31:52.739 --> 31:54.518
From the arm chair you were sitting in.

31:56.474 --> 31:57.577
Well, that's

31:58.190 --> 31:59.625
underhanded of you, Detective.

32:00.581 --> 32:01.874
It's only natural my fingermarks

32:01.880 --> 32:03.583
would be all over it. It's my syringe.

32:04.190 --> 32:06.701
I use it to inject morphine.
I'm a former wrestler.

32:07.027 --> 32:08.169
But I have no motive.

32:08.205 --> 32:10.370
Handsome Randolph was the star of my show.

32:11.789 --> 32:14.991
We were told that you quite
despised one another, Mr. McAllister.

32:15.044 --> 32:17.061
Be that as it may, the money he brought in

32:17.091 --> 32:19.805
far outweighed any
animosity I felt towards him.

32:19.900 --> 32:22.185
So why would you arrange
for Mr. Humber to defeat him?

32:22.339 --> 32:24.211
For the drama of it, of course.

32:24.614 --> 32:27.199
I intended for Randolph to
defeat Humber the following night

32:27.207 --> 32:28.852
and regain his title.

32:29.699 --> 32:31.828
The crowd would have lapped it up.

32:32.576 --> 32:35.610
Were you in the dressing room
immediately following the final bout?

32:35.883 --> 32:36.446
Yes.

32:37.056 --> 32:38.346
I went in to get morphine.

32:38.405 --> 32:40.537
I then retired to my office to inject it.

32:40.696 --> 32:42.984
And did you do so wearing the mask

32:43.157 --> 32:44.812
that Mr. Humber returned to you?

32:44.890 --> 32:47.844
Heavens no, I'd never wear
such a foolish article.

32:48.432 --> 32:50.940
So how did your syringe end up
in The Solid Man's possession?

32:52.236 --> 32:53.633
He must have taken it from my office.

32:53.753 --> 32:54.850
I can't fathom why.

32:56.876 --> 32:57.516
Well,

32:58.366 --> 33:00.170
I believe I've satisfied your curiosity.

33:02.741 --> 33:03.472
Gentlemen.

33:07.043 --> 33:08.804
(Crabtree sighing)

33:08.924 --> 33:10.236
Do you believe him, sir?

33:10.573 --> 33:12.815
I don't believe a single
thing he says, George.

33:12.864 --> 33:15.117
His entire business is built on deception.

33:16.413 --> 33:17.681
You know,

33:18.334 --> 33:20.930
Simon may be able to place
him at the scene of the crime.

33:22.819 --> 33:24.185
Yes, George,

33:24.425 --> 33:26.593
he could help us narrow down who came out

33:26.632 --> 33:28.143
of the dressing room with the mask.

33:32.306 --> 33:34.096
Julia, I'm certain

33:34.216 --> 33:37.874
Emily and Lillian will come around to
appreciate what Temperance can do for us.

33:37.994 --> 33:40.055
Maybe Emily's right.
Perhaps we have strayed

33:40.082 --> 33:42.323
- too far from our ideals.
- We can advance our cause

33:42.351 --> 33:45.460
by years, even decades, with their support.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.904
A compromise here and there
is a small price to pay.

33:48.915 --> 33:50.075
You're in my way.

33:51.520 --> 33:52.607
I suppose so.

33:53.564 --> 33:54.903
Miss Haile, Dr. Ogden.

33:54.943 --> 33:55.880
Miss Hamilton.

33:56.295 --> 33:58.490
Here is the campaign literature
I'd like for you to distribute.

33:59.270 --> 34:00.882
It's rather exciting, isn't it?

34:01.002 --> 34:03.547
Think of all the good we can do
for Toronto should we succeed.

34:04.533 --> 34:05.595
Banning books?

34:05.619 --> 34:06.365
Oh yes.

34:07.051 --> 34:08.347
Did you know our libraries

34:08.378 --> 34:10.368
give children access
to the criminal writings

34:10.385 --> 34:12.822
of such amoral libertines as Mark Twain?

34:13.112 --> 34:15.004
Frankly, I'd like to burn his books.

34:17.719 --> 34:19.956
Perhaps you ought to burn these instead.

34:20.146 --> 34:21.054
Pardon me?

34:22.138 --> 34:24.899
I think it best that we
part ways, Miss Hamilton.

34:25.387 --> 34:28.958
I cannot in good conscience continue
on under the banner of Temperance.

34:30.163 --> 34:31.786
Thank you for your time, Miss Hamilton.

34:44.538 --> 34:46.496
It doesn't fit. You see?

34:46.616 --> 34:49.435
It doesn't fit. Try harder, Mr. McAllister.

34:51.204 --> 34:52.804
It's too small.

34:53.023 --> 34:55.547
- If it doesn't fit...
- It's not the same mask.

34:55.667 --> 34:57.589
It's the one the Masked Man was
wearing in the ring that night.

34:57.633 --> 35:00.786
Yes, but it's not the one that
man who signed my book was wearing.

35:01.143 --> 35:02.235
There you have it, gentlemen.

35:02.287 --> 35:04.591
It obvious you have no case whatsoever.

35:04.711 --> 35:07.225
Now if you'll excuse me, I
need to get back to ringside.

35:07.638 --> 35:08.901
Enjoy the show, young man.

35:09.354 --> 35:10.956
Mr. McAllister.

35:11.596 --> 35:13.622
If you aren't the killer,

35:13.825 --> 35:16.404
then why did you give us
two conflicting alibis?

35:16.524 --> 35:19.549
- I did no such thing.
- Well yes, you told us you were out back

35:19.583 --> 35:21.872
moving equipment at the time of the murder,

35:21.907 --> 35:24.895
but then also told us you were
injecting yourself with morphine

35:24.904 --> 35:26.298
shortly after the match.

35:26.341 --> 35:28.509
Moving heavy equipment is hardly
something one would do after

35:28.522 --> 35:30.055
injecting themselves with morphine.

35:30.408 --> 35:31.880
Your story doesn't add up.

35:32.772 --> 35:34.127
Who are you covering for?

35:34.801 --> 35:37.162
I will not listen to these
slanderous accusations.

35:37.719 --> 35:39.822
These people paid good money to see a show

35:39.848 --> 35:41.325
and I intend to give them one.

35:45.183 --> 35:45.936
Sir,

35:46.310 --> 35:47.935
the alibi about moving equipment,

35:47.969 --> 35:49.102
he didn't tell us that.

35:49.136 --> 35:51.366
That came from Shane
Tindall, his equipment man.

35:51.593 --> 35:54.951
Tindall wasn't alibiing his
employer, he was alibiing himself.

35:55.071 --> 35:55.765
(Bell ringing)

35:59.174 --> 36:01.948
Shane Tindall? Does
anyone know Shane Tindall?

36:01.966 --> 36:03.028
Shane Tindall?

36:03.303 --> 36:05.630
Does anybody know Shane Tindall?

36:06.080 --> 36:07.443
Edna, what are you doing here?

36:07.478 --> 36:09.063
- Mother.
- What's he doing here?

36:09.133 --> 36:11.164
He's helping. Don't worry.

36:11.746 --> 36:14.476
Shane Tindall, we're
looking for Shane Tindall.

36:21.944 --> 36:23.666
(screaming)

36:27.170 --> 36:28.478
Good heavens.

36:28.739 --> 36:31.006
Come in, come in, come in.

36:40.048 --> 36:43.203
Ladies and gentlemen,

36:43.551 --> 36:46.808
The Cossack appreciates your concern.

36:46.830 --> 36:49.415
Indeed he is injured,

36:49.535 --> 36:51.614
but he's being tended
to in the dressing room

36:51.690 --> 36:53.873
while we await an ambulance carriage.

36:54.973 --> 36:55.876
George,

36:55.996 --> 36:57.656
do you believe this to be part of the act?

36:57.700 --> 36:59.671
- Who could say anymore?
- However,

36:59.719 --> 37:04.237
the Cossack has asked
that the show continue!

37:04.406 --> 37:06.406
(crowd cheering)

37:24.237 --> 37:25.228
That's him!

37:25.483 --> 37:28.366
That's the guy who signed my
book. He's wearing the same mask!

37:28.580 --> 37:30.066
Sir, that's Shane Tindall.

37:30.088 --> 37:32.921
- He's trying to hide in plain sight.
- George, what are you doing?

37:33.317 --> 37:34.680
Stop right there!

37:57.572 --> 37:59.891
It's the Cossack!

38:04.429 --> 38:08.348
- Are you okay?
- Sir, sir, it's not Shane Tindall.

38:08.383 --> 38:10.650
- It's the Cossack in a mask!
- Careful, George!

38:10.662 --> 38:12.792
It's the Cossack in a mask!

38:14.268 --> 38:15.873
He'll be fine.

38:33.625 --> 38:35.325
No, no, no, no!

38:38.666 --> 38:41.299
George, hit him with this!

38:41.419 --> 38:43.456
- It's a chair.
- Hit him with it.

38:45.150 --> 38:47.528
(impact)

38:51.442 --> 38:54.150
(crowd cheering)

38:59.395 --> 39:00.544
Edna,

39:00.565 --> 39:03.211
I suppose this is as good a time as any...

39:03.521 --> 39:05.484
the entire sport of wrestling is fake.

39:05.532 --> 39:06.997
Of course I know that, George.

39:07.008 --> 39:09.387
Do you think I would actually root
for people to hurt one another?

39:09.452 --> 39:12.128
Well, you just had me hit that
man in the head with a chair!

39:25.366 --> 39:26.928
What do you want? Get out of here!

39:30.460 --> 39:33.186
Take this money and get lost!

39:33.306 --> 39:34.759
I'm sorry, Mr. McAllister.

39:35.009 --> 39:36.190
I only meant to help.

39:36.473 --> 39:38.204
By killing my star attraction?

39:38.258 --> 39:41.514
- With my syringe, no less!
- I thought you hated Handsome Randolph.

39:42.210 --> 39:44.710
When I saw how angry you were,
I tried to cover my tracks.

39:44.739 --> 39:46.596
By trying to frame one
of my other wrestlers.

39:46.920 --> 39:48.734
I didn't mean for that to happen!

39:49.135 --> 39:51.121
I've always been loyal to you, sir.

39:52.479 --> 39:54.593
Which is the only reason
I'm not turning you in.

39:54.794 --> 39:55.621
Driver,

39:55.689 --> 39:58.616
I never want to see this man's face
again. Take him to Union Station.

39:59.465 --> 40:02.311
How about Station House
Number Four instead?

40:03.754 --> 40:05.857
Thank you for your confession.

40:10.938 --> 40:13.208
Now, people, I'm just a Constable

40:13.246 --> 40:15.963
trying to do his job. But that said,

40:16.224 --> 40:18.140
I will try to get to each of you.

40:18.210 --> 40:19.946
Can I have an autograph too?

40:20.861 --> 40:23.865
Uh, yes, young man, I
suppose I could manage that.

40:32.363 --> 40:34.341
- Julia.
- Emily.

40:34.905 --> 40:37.113
I heard what happened with Miss Hamilton.

40:37.121 --> 40:39.486
I'm sorry things didn't work out.

40:39.555 --> 40:42.508
Would you mind if we skipped the
apologies and went straight to the whiskey?

40:42.551 --> 40:44.414
Whiskey? Ha! Ha!

40:45.364 --> 40:48.357
It seems there are some mysteries
of the morgue I've yet to discover.

40:48.433 --> 40:50.515
- Will these do?
- Brilliant.

40:53.315 --> 40:54.730
Prohibition, my eye.

40:55.888 --> 40:57.464
To the Furious Four.

41:00.294 --> 41:01.156
Oh...

41:02.528 --> 41:04.214
- Again?
- Of course.

41:14.968 --> 41:16.788
(laughs)

41:17.150 --> 41:18.325
One more.

41:18.408 --> 41:20.307
I'm done working today.

41:22.896 --> 41:24.176
Just a second, Evans.

41:24.577 --> 41:26.048
What the bloody hell are you doing here?

41:26.391 --> 41:27.711
I thought you ran off with my money.

41:27.780 --> 41:29.378
Sir, this man stole your money?

41:29.395 --> 41:30.919
Hold on there, I haven't stolen anything.

41:31.049 --> 41:32.763
I gave him my savings to invest.

41:32.798 --> 41:34.755
Then he closed his
barbershop and disappeared.

41:35.135 --> 41:37.552
You gave your savings to your barber, sir?

41:37.580 --> 41:39.124
Oh, don't you start, Murdoch.

41:39.244 --> 41:41.303
As it happens, I know my
way around an investment.

41:41.331 --> 41:43.630
I've done so well, in fact,
I've decided to retire early.

41:44.013 --> 41:45.310
Oh, I see.

41:45.718 --> 41:47.086
This is your investment account.

41:47.787 --> 41:50.051
My wife doesn't like the idea.

41:50.135 --> 41:52.675
She wants our money back in
the cookie jar where it belongs.

41:52.727 --> 41:55.187
Really, I'm disappointed.
I'll cash you out tomorrow.

41:55.260 --> 41:57.153
Detective, what about you?
I can make you a bundle.

41:57.186 --> 41:58.541
- Real estate perhaps?
- Oh,

41:58.740 --> 42:01.237
investing in property
seems somewhat foolhardy.

42:01.610 --> 42:04.704
I don't see how home prices in
this city can continue to rise.

42:05.400 --> 42:06.790
The stock market, then.

42:07.344 --> 42:10.479
I am quite happy with the
interest offered on my account

42:10.531 --> 42:12.314
at the Post Office Savings Bank,

42:12.434 --> 42:14.231
- thank you.
- The loss is yours.

42:14.283 --> 42:15.074
Gentlemen.

42:16.678 --> 42:20.341
Sir, do you think he has any
idea what he's talking about?

42:20.375 --> 42:22.354
All I know is that according to Margaret,

42:22.395 --> 42:23.869
the man can't even cut bloody hair.

42:24.827 --> 42:25.503
Sirs,

42:26.158 --> 42:26.966
you called for me?

42:27.297 --> 42:28.321
Ah, Crabtree.

42:28.850 --> 42:31.251
We wanted to compliment
you on a fine piece of work.

42:31.371 --> 42:33.389
- Yes.
- Even if your diligence

42:33.407 --> 42:35.496
did uncover that professional
wrestling is a sham.

42:35.813 --> 42:37.953
Yes, I doubt fans will
continue to follow it

42:37.992 --> 42:39.997
so feverishly once the truth reaches them.

42:40.725 --> 42:41.669
Nevertheless,

42:41.857 --> 42:44.013
I think it's about time you
get measured for a new suit.

42:44.790 --> 42:45.326
Sir?

42:45.894 --> 42:46.609
Yes, George.

42:46.647 --> 42:49.520
You've been serving in a
Constable's tunic long enough.

42:50.735 --> 42:52.027
Sirs?

42:52.111 --> 42:53.521
Don't be thick, buggerlugs.

42:53.744 --> 42:55.535
There's an opening at
Station House Number Three

42:55.545 --> 42:57.537
for a new Detective. I've put you forward.

43:00.421 --> 43:01.916
They'd be lucky to have you, George.

43:22.862 --> 43:24.342
Announcer: All new <i>Murdoch... </i>
