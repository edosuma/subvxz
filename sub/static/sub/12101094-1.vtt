WEBVTT

03:17.489 --> 03:18.490
Seven-fifty.

03:22.061 --> 03:24.130
Is there no chance you can
spare us a dollar or two, huh?

03:27.699 --> 03:29.035
Right.

03:36.541 --> 03:37.542
How's your dad doing?

03:39.946 --> 03:41.579
He's hanging in there.

03:59.799 --> 04:01.533
Hey. Hey!

04:06.205 --> 04:08.606
Do I know you?

04:08.640 --> 04:11.509
Look at me like that again
like you did inside of there,

04:11.543 --> 04:15.214
and I'll knock your fucking
lights out... China boy.

04:18.851 --> 04:19.885
I'm Korean.

04:21.720 --> 04:22.888
Same fucking thing to me.

04:23.456 --> 04:24.790
All right. See you, man.

04:41.073 --> 04:42.875
You think you're
better than me, don't you?

04:42.908 --> 04:44.542
I saw the way you
looked at me back there.

04:46.145 --> 04:47.079
No! No!

04:47.113 --> 04:49.915
What are you,
some kind of computer whiz?

04:49.949 --> 04:51.884
- I don't know...
- Shut the fuck up!

04:53.085 --> 04:55.221
Yeah. You're all the same.

04:55.254 --> 04:56.889
You flood into our
fucking country

04:56.922 --> 04:58.157
and you take all of our jobs.

04:59.792 --> 05:00.793
No, no, no...

05:08.234 --> 05:11.137
You're a little rat,
aren't you?

05:13.339 --> 05:14.539
Say it.

05:15.941 --> 05:17.076
I'm a little rat.

05:17.642 --> 05:18.643
Louder.

05:20.746 --> 05:22.148
I'm a little rat.

05:23.816 --> 05:24.950
Louder.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.853
- Louder!
- I'm a little rat!

05:27.887 --> 05:29.889
I'm... I'm a little rat.

05:32.124 --> 05:34.126
Don't you ever come
back here again, rat.

06:21.273 --> 06:22.374
What are you looking at?

06:40.960 --> 06:42.094
Ah, Prasumas.

06:42.128 --> 06:43.195
My favorite.

06:46.966 --> 06:48.033
Johnny...

06:49.235 --> 06:50.903
What happened to your face?

06:52.704 --> 06:54.406
It's fine.

06:54.440 --> 06:57.009
- Huh?
- I said it's fine.

06:57.042 --> 07:00.212
Ay, Johnny, it's all...
You're bleeding.

07:06.385 --> 07:08.686
Who did this to you?

07:09.488 --> 07:11.290
Seriously, it isn't a big deal.

07:18.330 --> 07:19.965
I should have been there.

07:21.300 --> 07:22.801
I can take care of myself, Dad.

07:25.804 --> 07:28.073
They're scared of you
because you're different.

07:29.341 --> 07:31.177
But that's not your fault.

07:32.178 --> 07:34.413
Different doesn't
mean you're bad.

07:34.446 --> 07:35.915
I know.

07:59.872 --> 08:01.974
Johnny, one day...

08:03.042 --> 08:05.177
I won't be here
to look after you.

08:07.546 --> 08:09.114
Who is looking after who?

08:15.221 --> 08:16.855
You're not going anywhere.

09:04.403 --> 09:05.904
Is this some kind of prank?

09:31.964 --> 09:34.066
What...?

09:50.416 --> 09:51.450
Crazy.

09:52.618 --> 09:53.852
It's crazy.

10:37.663 --> 10:38.864
Who is this?

10:39.465 --> 10:40.566
<i>Friend.</i>

10:57.950 --> 10:59.118
<i>I like your music.</i>

11:01.453 --> 11:03.088
Is it?

11:03.122 --> 11:04.289
It's kind of depressing.

11:08.160 --> 11:10.062
<i>Sad but not mean.</i>

11:13.098 --> 11:14.099
I guess.

11:17.636 --> 11:18.637
<i>What is that?</i>

11:24.343 --> 11:26.078
You can hear that?

11:26.111 --> 11:27.446
<i>I hear certain sounds.</i>

11:32.551 --> 11:33.552
<i>What's happening?</i>

11:35.154 --> 11:36.688
Bad things.

11:39.759 --> 11:41.293
<i>What do we do?</i>

11:46.098 --> 11:47.099
Nothing.

11:50.536 --> 11:52.271
We can't do anything.

11:59.611 --> 12:00.946
Not our problem.

12:30.075 --> 12:34.279
- Um, hello.
- <i>I can help.</i>

12:34.313 --> 12:36.014
<i>But I need your help</i>

12:36.048 --> 12:37.282
<i>and permission.</i>

12:40.152 --> 12:41.253
What are you going to do?

12:42.221 --> 12:44.156
<i>Stop the bad things.</i>

12:48.060 --> 12:49.061
And, uh...

12:51.697 --> 12:54.767
What kind of...
help do you need?

12:56.301 --> 12:58.771
<i>I want to see through you.</i>

13:02.775 --> 13:03.776
I don't get it.

13:05.344 --> 13:07.079
<i>I want to be part
of your world.</i>

13:07.713 --> 13:09.348
<i>The real world.</i>

13:09.381 --> 13:11.350
<i>See. What do you see?</i>

13:16.488 --> 13:17.489
Um...

13:20.092 --> 13:21.593
Okay, okay.

13:38.878 --> 13:40.747
No!

13:45.384 --> 13:48.620
No. Please.
Help me, please.

14:01.667 --> 14:03.335
<i>911.
What's your emergency?</i>

14:04.269 --> 14:05.270
<i>Hello?</i>

14:06.171 --> 14:07.172
<i>Hello?</i>

14:14.346 --> 14:15.514
Hey, rat!

14:18.851 --> 14:20.820
What did I tell you, huh?

14:23.188 --> 14:25.090
I told you not to come
around here anymore.

14:25.591 --> 14:27.760
Didn't I, rat? Huh?

14:28.594 --> 14:29.595
Don't call me that.

14:30.696 --> 14:33.131
I'll call you whatever I want.

14:33.165 --> 14:35.133
Someone else calls you
that nickname, right?

14:37.536 --> 14:39.404
Oh. They don't know, do they?

14:39.438 --> 14:40.606
Shut the fuck up.

14:42.407 --> 14:44.911
Mommy went to jail when
Dirk was a little boy, huh?

14:44.944 --> 14:46.879
Shut the fuck up.
Do you hear me?

14:46.913 --> 14:49.348
When daddy gets lonely,
he gets drunk.

14:50.649 --> 14:53.418
He must have hit you a little too
hard inside of your head, huh?

14:53.452 --> 14:56.856
- Come on, Dirk.
- 'Cause now you're out picking on rats like me.

14:59.191 --> 15:00.525
You know it's
really something.

15:02.527 --> 15:03.796
All the shit you can find

15:03.830 --> 15:05.564
when you dig
into someone's cell phone.

15:05.597 --> 15:07.232
You my fucking shrink now?

15:07.265 --> 15:08.266
<i>What's happening?</i>

15:08.735 --> 15:09.769
Bad people.

15:09.802 --> 15:11.169
Don't look at me like that.

15:12.638 --> 15:14.874
- Stop.
- Don't fucking look to me like that.

15:14.907 --> 15:16.441
<i>I want to help.</i>

15:17.242 --> 15:18.276
Do it.

16:16.334 --> 16:17.937
Mm...

16:20.006 --> 16:23.976
These must be the best Prasumas yet.
They're so juicy.

16:26.378 --> 16:27.914
They're so juicy.

16:29.481 --> 16:30.883
I like when you're happy.

16:30.917 --> 16:33.251
It makes me happy.

16:33.886 --> 16:35.353
I can't always be happy.

16:36.956 --> 16:38.925
I guess that this
will have to do.

16:45.697 --> 16:46.866
Don't you have to get that?

16:55.674 --> 16:56.876
What is it?

16:56.909 --> 16:58.310
<i>You're punishing him.</i>

16:59.544 --> 17:00.813
Sorry?

17:00.847 --> 17:03.750
<i>Your father... it will spread
quickly and he will suffer.</i>

17:04.851 --> 17:05.918
<i>You're punishing him.</i>

17:07.652 --> 17:12.859
No.
He wants to be with me.

17:12.892 --> 17:16.963
<i>You are the one causing this
pain but it didn't... like this.</i>

17:17.797 --> 17:19.297
<i>Let me help.</i>

17:19.331 --> 17:20.933
- No.
- <i>Let me help.</i>

17:20.967 --> 17:22.567
Absolutely not.

17:22.601 --> 17:24.436
<i>You sound like a bad man.</i>

17:25.838 --> 17:27.672
I won't let you do this.

17:27.706 --> 17:29.474
<i>I don't need your permission.</i>

17:36.414 --> 17:37.516
Johnny!

17:37.549 --> 17:39.018
Stay away
from anything connected.

17:41.888 --> 17:42.955
Quick! We have
to get out of here.

17:42.989 --> 17:44.356
We have to get out of here!

17:48.094 --> 17:49.394
Oh, my God!

18:07.947 --> 18:09.414
Shit.

18:30.502 --> 18:31.570
No!

18:32.171 --> 18:33.973
No, no, no.

18:34.006 --> 18:35.074
Stay away from him!

18:38.110 --> 18:39.578
I'll do anything.

18:39.611 --> 18:40.847
Just don't hurt him.

18:42.181 --> 18:43.950
<i>Find me another.</i>

19:22.520 --> 19:23.990
Hey, how you doing back there?

19:24.489 --> 19:25.490
Hm?

19:26.893 --> 19:27.927
Hm?

19:29.561 --> 19:30.695
Nice and comfy?

19:32.798 --> 19:35.768
You don't say much
but you are great company.

20:47.239 --> 20:48.240
Hello, Jonathan.

20:49.641 --> 20:51.576
Where am I?

20:51.609 --> 20:53.980
That is
everybody's first question.

20:54.780 --> 20:56.148
Totally normal reaction.

20:56.182 --> 20:59.617
The real question is,
where do we place you?

21:01.653 --> 21:04.223
It says here that you are
good with computers.

21:04.256 --> 21:06.058
You actually
build your own rigs.

21:06.092 --> 21:07.960
I do, too.

21:07.994 --> 21:11.596
In fact, I've actually built
one of my own right here.

21:11.629 --> 21:13.265
I think you might appreciate it.
Would you like to go see it?

21:17.702 --> 21:18.703
Right.

21:19.939 --> 21:21.307
You know, somebody
with your skill set

21:21.340 --> 21:23.809
could really rise the ranks
around here.

21:36.222 --> 21:40.159
Interesting.

21:40.192 --> 21:42.828
You know, reactions tell us
so much about the human mind.

21:46.698 --> 21:47.733
For example...

21:49.769 --> 21:52.938
you spitting in my face tells
me you tend to get bullied...

21:55.141 --> 21:58.077
that you're not very good
at protecting yourself.

22:00.046 --> 22:01.847
What does my reaction
tell you about me?

22:14.727 --> 22:15.961
You know,
you look like somebody

22:15.995 --> 22:17.897
who used to be here
a very long time ago.

22:20.632 --> 22:22.068
Same disrespect.

22:24.702 --> 22:26.005
Jones!

22:30.543 --> 22:32.211
Our patient has
had a very long day.

22:32.244 --> 22:33.846
Let's make sure
he feels at home.

22:34.180 --> 22:35.281
Yes, sir.

22:35.314 --> 22:36.315
Where to?

22:39.018 --> 22:40.019
Block 10.

22:47.760 --> 22:48.861
Campers!

22:55.935 --> 22:58.104
Jonathan, I'd like you
to meet your new friends.

22:58.137 --> 22:59.138
It's Johnny.

23:01.941 --> 23:03.275
Are we being a little shy?

23:06.779 --> 23:09.081
All right, allow me
to make the introductions.

23:10.116 --> 23:12.650
Over here. This is Alma.

23:12.684 --> 23:15.054
She's a little bit
of a crank pot. Stay clear.

23:15.855 --> 23:17.289
This one is Emma.

23:17.323 --> 23:21.093
Ignore her scar.
She can be very sweet... at times.

23:22.461 --> 23:23.661
Hi, Emma.

23:26.866 --> 23:29.869
This is our mommy, Renee.

23:34.740 --> 23:35.741
Pleasure.

23:36.942 --> 23:39.011
And that cot right there
is designated for,

23:39.044 --> 23:41.947
well, Sami.

23:41.981 --> 23:43.415
She's getting ready
for her session.

23:44.850 --> 23:45.985
Let's get him dressed.

23:47.086 --> 23:48.420
I can't wait
to show you the lab.

24:10.276 --> 24:12.978
It's funny, after so many
years of experimentation,

24:13.012 --> 24:15.347
the solution is so simple.

24:15.381 --> 24:17.483
Target receptors in the brain

24:17.516 --> 24:20.119
by a homemade
cocktail designed by me

24:20.152 --> 24:23.822
that allows to extract
the sensation known as fear...

24:25.291 --> 24:27.860
into an easily contained gas.

24:31.063 --> 24:34.433
Please. I can't do it again.

24:34.466 --> 24:36.468
They tend to get like this after
they've been here for a while.

24:39.138 --> 24:40.306
You see this canister?

24:41.974 --> 24:43.708
This is our future.

24:44.243 --> 24:45.477
It holds the gas.

24:47.112 --> 24:49.815
Sami, why don't you show
the new guy how it works?

24:53.352 --> 24:55.020
All right, I'll help.

25:38.397 --> 25:39.798
So, you're just gonna leave?

25:40.499 --> 25:42.568
Harry, please, just stop.

25:42.601 --> 25:44.403
It was a fucking accident.

25:44.436 --> 25:46.238
- Shut the fuck up!
- Stop.

25:46.272 --> 25:48.073
This is exactly why
I need to get away from you.

25:48.107 --> 25:49.541
You're fucking twisted.

25:49.575 --> 25:51.143
Harry, I didn't mean to.

25:51.176 --> 25:52.878
Come on.
You know I didn't mean to...

25:52.911 --> 25:55.214
Bullshit! You fucking used me.

25:55.247 --> 25:57.583
Harry, please just wait...

25:57.616 --> 25:59.551
Babe, babe, babe, come on.

25:59.585 --> 26:01.120
Babe, look at me.
Look at me.

26:01.153 --> 26:02.921
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

26:02.955 --> 26:04.223
Babe, what about us?

26:04.256 --> 26:05.524
- Hm? Come on.
- "Us"?

26:06.859 --> 26:08.327
There was no fucking "us".

26:08.360 --> 26:09.361
It was all about you.

26:11.964 --> 26:14.867
How am I gonna do this?
I can't do this alone.

26:14.900 --> 26:17.870
You should have fucking thought
about that before you did it, huh?

26:17.903 --> 26:19.505
Come on. Let's just go back.
Everything will be fine.

26:19.538 --> 26:21.106
I'm just freaking out
right now.

26:21.140 --> 26:22.608
Come on. Let's just fucking go.

26:22.641 --> 26:25.311
Get the fuck away from me,
you crazy fucking bitch!

26:34.053 --> 26:35.421
What the fuck
are you looking at?

26:39.058 --> 26:40.059
Fuck!

27:00.679 --> 27:01.880
Fuck!

27:07.419 --> 27:08.620
Fucking...

27:12.491 --> 27:13.625
Fuck.

27:14.426 --> 27:15.928
Fuck! Fuck!

27:18.263 --> 27:19.264
Fuck.

28:34.039 --> 28:35.607
Oh, shit!

28:51.190 --> 28:52.991
Pick up the fucking phone.

28:53.025 --> 28:54.426
<i>You know what to do.</i>

28:57.663 --> 28:58.664
Fuck.

29:01.166 --> 29:04.136
Fucking shit!

29:16.648 --> 29:18.016
What the fuck?

29:21.286 --> 29:22.354
Fuck.

29:24.156 --> 29:25.624
Fuck. What the fuck?

29:32.130 --> 29:33.298
Fuck...

29:35.400 --> 29:36.401
Fuck.

30:12.304 --> 30:13.338
<i>You know what to do.</i>

30:13.372 --> 30:14.640
No.

31:35.788 --> 31:36.823
Come on, baby.

31:44.262 --> 31:45.430
Come on.

31:45.464 --> 31:47.265
Yeah.

32:31.276 --> 32:32.644
Fuck!

32:36.916 --> 32:38.283
Oh, my God.

33:13.351 --> 33:14.787
We can finally
get a place.

33:18.356 --> 33:19.357
Just you and I.

33:22.394 --> 33:23.562
Maybe with a garage.

33:24.831 --> 33:25.832
Where we can practice.

33:27.734 --> 33:29.301
Maybe get that new guitar.

33:30.302 --> 33:31.336
No shit.

33:36.809 --> 33:38.677
I don't think they see him.

33:38.710 --> 33:41.613
Every day at 6:00,
he takes a drawer to the bank.

33:42.982 --> 33:43.983
Hey.

33:44.984 --> 33:46.451
Just do what we talked about.

33:48.587 --> 33:49.721
Everything will be fine.

33:55.393 --> 33:56.394
No one gets hurt?

33:59.065 --> 34:00.265
No one.

34:01.333 --> 34:02.400
Just scare him a little.

34:04.569 --> 34:06.839
He's an asshole,
but he's not stupid.

34:08.808 --> 34:09.876
He'll give it up.

34:13.079 --> 34:14.279
Ready?

34:15.014 --> 34:16.015
You got this.

34:27.093 --> 34:29.528
Hey, I'm right here.

34:30.797 --> 34:32.697
Okay. You got this.

34:33.800 --> 34:35.067
You fucking got this.

34:58.390 --> 34:59.658
Give me the fucking money.

35:02.728 --> 35:05.031
Over my dead body,
you little shit.

35:05.064 --> 35:06.732
I'm not fucking
around with you!

35:06.766 --> 35:07.733
Give me the fucking money.

35:07.767 --> 35:10.803
You don't have the balls
to take my money, son.

35:25.650 --> 35:26.886
Come on, Harry!

35:27.987 --> 35:28.988
Fuck.

35:58.985 --> 36:00.753
What the fuck
have you done?

36:01.787 --> 36:04.090
Just shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

36:04.656 --> 36:06.792
Open the fucking trunk.

36:06.826 --> 36:08.160
Open the fucking trunk.

36:59.912 --> 37:01.646
Yes. More.

37:04.750 --> 37:05.818
That's good.

37:07.652 --> 37:08.653
More.

37:15.660 --> 37:17.163
Don't! Make it stop!

37:17.964 --> 37:19.597
Damn it, Sami!

37:28.540 --> 37:30.642
Well, at least we got some
of what we needed.

37:30.675 --> 37:31.676
Get him out of here.

38:15.788 --> 38:17.890
No! No! No!

38:20.359 --> 38:22.128
Hey.

38:22.161 --> 38:25.630
Hey, Emma. It's all right.
It's all right.

38:25.663 --> 38:26.732
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

38:26.766 --> 38:27.933
There's nothing there.

38:29.201 --> 38:31.103
What's going on?

38:31.137 --> 38:32.972
Too many of those
fucking sessions.

38:33.005 --> 38:34.807
I just want it to stop.

38:34.840 --> 38:36.308
I just
wanna get some sleep.

38:36.342 --> 38:38.811
Hey,
keep your voice down.

38:38.844 --> 38:40.612
You don't want them to take
you back to the shrinker.

38:41.781 --> 38:42.915
Why do they call it that?

38:44.083 --> 38:46.285
Too many tests in it
shrinks your brain.

38:46.318 --> 38:48.788
The more you talk about it,
the better you'll feel...

38:50.289 --> 38:52.324
and the less
the machine will affect you.

39:10.309 --> 39:13.711
- Hi, husband.
- <i>Wife.</i>

39:13.746 --> 39:15.347
<i>How come
you're not asleep?</i>

39:15.381 --> 39:16.382
I don't know,

39:16.415 --> 39:18.951
grading papers,
waiting for you.

39:18.984 --> 39:21.220
<i>Yeah. Uh,
that's why I'm calling.</i>

39:21.253 --> 39:24.056
<i>I gotta be here a little bit
later than I was thinking</i>

39:24.090 --> 39:26.258
<i>to spend the night
at the office.</i>

39:26.292 --> 39:28.094
<i>Come back and see you tomorrow?</i>

39:28.127 --> 39:29.795
It's, like,
four nights in a row.

39:29.829 --> 39:31.163
I'm starting to think
you're having an affair.

39:31.197 --> 39:33.665
<i>Look,
I'll just come back in the morning.</i>

39:33.698 --> 39:34.867
<i>Get some sleep.</i>

39:34.900 --> 39:37.002
<i>Take a break from grading.
They're middle schoolers.</i>

39:37.036 --> 39:38.237
<i>How complex are they?</i>

39:38.270 --> 39:40.005
You'd be surprised.

39:40.039 --> 39:41.706
<i>I'll believe
when I see it.</i>

39:41.740 --> 39:44.609
- <i>I love you.</i>
- Love you.

41:15.935 --> 41:16.936
Hello?

41:19.271 --> 41:20.272
Who is this?

41:24.243 --> 41:25.277
Hello?

42:16.595 --> 42:17.796
Hello?

43:05.210 --> 43:06.945
Fuck.

43:32.671 --> 43:33.872
Fuck.

43:36.241 --> 43:37.976
Who the fuck is doing this?

43:39.078 --> 43:40.245
Who's in my house?

43:40.279 --> 43:43.248
Get out of my fucking house.
Get out of my fucking house!

43:59.164 --> 44:00.666
Hello?

44:18.384 --> 44:20.185
Olly olly oxen free.

44:28.360 --> 44:29.962
Damn, Blaire. Got her good.

44:29.995 --> 44:31.096
Fuck yeah, I did.

44:32.664 --> 44:33.665
You see this?

44:35.567 --> 44:36.902
Your sister's done good.

44:37.703 --> 44:38.971
Want to taste the blade?

44:41.573 --> 44:43.709
How are we gonna do her?

44:43.743 --> 44:46.245
Stab her
till she bleeds out, I guess.

44:46.278 --> 44:47.646
Won't that be too much blood?

44:47.679 --> 44:48.714
Yeah, Grady.

44:48.748 --> 44:50.516
Bodies have blood in them.

44:50.549 --> 44:52.451
So, yeah, she'll have a bit
more blood to come out.

44:53.787 --> 44:56.688
Why are you doing this?
What are you doing here?

44:58.357 --> 44:59.491
Stop talking.

45:01.393 --> 45:02.528
I'll cut your lips off.

45:07.299 --> 45:08.367
Isaac...

45:10.135 --> 45:11.270
Hi, Miss Palmer.

45:11.303 --> 45:14.206
- Isaac, don't look at her, man.
- No, Isaac, look at her.

45:15.207 --> 45:17.176
I want everyone to look at her.

45:24.583 --> 45:25.584
He's cute.

45:27.586 --> 45:28.587
Real handsome.

45:30.757 --> 45:32.090
Blaire, come on.

45:33.692 --> 45:35.461
You like to fuck
married men, do you?

45:39.665 --> 45:41.266
Would you like to fuck our dad?

45:41.768 --> 45:43.469
Blaire, stop.

45:44.336 --> 45:46.171
I'm sorry.

45:48.540 --> 45:49.776
I'm sorry.

45:49.809 --> 45:51.276
Sorry for which part?

45:53.579 --> 45:54.580
Fucking our dad?

45:56.648 --> 45:58.016
For ruining our family?

46:01.487 --> 46:03.222
Why don't we just curb stomp
her outside and then...

46:03.255 --> 46:04.256
stab her to death.

46:06.058 --> 46:09.094
We can't just bring her outside
and curb stomp her, dumb shit.

46:09.127 --> 46:10.730
Fuck. There's rocks
in your brains.

46:10.763 --> 46:13.165
- Why not?
- 'Cause the neighbors will see.

46:13.198 --> 46:15.133
No one's gonna see it.
They're all gonna be asleep...

46:30.649 --> 46:32.718
You're one
clumsy bitch, Miss Palmer.

46:40.325 --> 46:41.326
You coming?

46:44.797 --> 46:47.399
You want dad to be a fucking
punchline for the rest of his life?

46:50.235 --> 46:51.236
Let's go.

47:03.282 --> 47:05.217
You kids don't think you're gonna
really get away with this, do you?

47:05.250 --> 47:06.251
Shut up.

47:08.186 --> 47:10.088
We're gonna do her or what?
I'm starving.

47:12.792 --> 47:13.793
Strip.

47:16.328 --> 47:17.329
What?

47:19.899 --> 47:21.667
Blaire, stop this.

47:44.389 --> 47:45.825
I want you
to take off your clothes.

47:47.593 --> 47:48.594
No.

47:50.362 --> 47:52.732
I'm sorry... what?

47:52.765 --> 47:53.833
I'm not doing that.

47:57.169 --> 47:58.670
You're acting like
you have a choice.

48:01.239 --> 48:02.240
Why?

48:07.412 --> 48:09.448
'Cause we want some
foreplay before we kill you.

48:30.602 --> 48:32.304
Come on, Blaire.
That is enough.

48:32.337 --> 48:34.239
Isaac, one more time...

48:50.923 --> 48:52.591
Let me out.

48:52.624 --> 48:53.793
Calm down, calm down.

49:04.670 --> 49:05.772
It was an accident.

49:06.973 --> 49:08.173
It was an accident.

49:10.409 --> 49:11.543
It was an accident.

49:16.916 --> 49:18.483
Shit, Blaire.
I think he's dead.

49:19.718 --> 49:20.820
What the fuck did you do?

49:23.355 --> 49:24.589
Help!

49:24.623 --> 49:25.691
Help!

49:40.807 --> 49:41.908
Get the fuck off me.

50:23.682 --> 50:26.351
911, I'd like
to report a murder.

50:36.561 --> 50:38.363
We were just messing around.

50:39.766 --> 50:40.933
But then she just snapped.

50:43.736 --> 50:45.604
Stay right here. We'll make
sure you get home safely.

50:46.705 --> 50:48.373
- Mom?
- Sweetheart.

50:48.406 --> 50:49.942
- Mom.
- It's okay.

50:50.877 --> 50:53.813
I'm just freaking out.
What is going on?

50:59.618 --> 51:00.920
Get the hell away from me.

51:02.054 --> 51:03.355
Okay, okay, okay.

51:03.388 --> 51:05.057
- Get away from me.
- Okay, okay, relax.

52:11.556 --> 52:12.691
Who's up first?

52:12.724 --> 52:13.725
Please let me see him.

52:14.559 --> 52:16.428
- Okay.
- Now.

52:17.529 --> 52:19.464
- Let's get you hooked up.
- In person.

52:24.036 --> 52:25.071
Please, he's so young.

52:28.107 --> 52:30.042
I'll go instead.

52:30.076 --> 52:32.677
Oh, I love volunteers.

52:37.616 --> 52:39.118
But, sadly,
that's not how this works.

52:45.124 --> 52:46.125
Come on.

52:50.229 --> 52:52.131
Up you go. Yeah.

53:12.919 --> 53:14.220
Full cannister, please.

53:30.970 --> 53:31.971
Clear.

53:49.021 --> 53:50.588
Drop it. Put it down!

53:53.059 --> 53:54.160
Clear.

53:54.193 --> 53:55.861
Move. Get down on the ground.

53:58.731 --> 53:59.698
There's two in here.

53:59.732 --> 54:01.133
Put your hands
where I can see them.

54:02.234 --> 54:03.468
Shut the fuck up.

54:05.805 --> 54:06.806
No.

54:12.812 --> 54:13.813
Oh, shit.

54:16.681 --> 54:18.583
- Come on.
- What the fuck, man.

54:18.616 --> 54:20.119
Hey, take him outside.

54:20.152 --> 54:21.153
- Get the rest.
- Clear.

54:48.214 --> 54:51.017
Take all the time you need,
all right?

54:51.050 --> 54:52.918
I'm gonna go make sure
everything's in order.

55:04.696 --> 55:05.697
Let's go.

55:45.905 --> 55:46.972
Mama.

55:49.942 --> 55:51.844
Mr. B said I'm
sounding pretty good so far.

55:51.877 --> 55:53.678
Yeah? Let me hear some.

55:53.711 --> 55:56.015
Okay. This is the D
major scale.

56:13.232 --> 56:16.135
I can't believe
you just started lessons.

56:16.168 --> 56:18.237
It is sounding so good.

56:18.270 --> 56:20.272
Yeah. It's really hard.

56:20.306 --> 56:22.308
Oh, try it. Try it.

56:22.341 --> 56:24.676
No. You know
I can't play anything.

56:24.709 --> 56:27.079
- Oh, yes, you can.
- No, I don't even know how to hold it.

56:27.113 --> 56:30.082
Okay, so you put
this hand right here,

56:30.116 --> 56:33.419
and then you hold the bow
on the other hand,

56:33.452 --> 56:36.654
and then you put
the bow right there.

56:36.688 --> 56:38.057
And yes.

56:39.992 --> 56:42.727
Why is it not making any sound?

56:44.696 --> 56:46.765
Oh.

56:46.799 --> 56:49.701
- I'm much better at singing.
- No, no, no, no.

56:49.735 --> 56:53.072
- What's wrong with my singing?
- You sing horrible.

57:10.923 --> 57:11.924
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

57:21.734 --> 57:22.935
Carlos, get down.

57:22.968 --> 57:23.969
Down on the floor.

57:24.470 --> 57:25.670
Carlos!

57:33.746 --> 57:36.115
Mama! Mama!

57:39.852 --> 57:42.388
- Mama!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

57:42.421 --> 57:43.789
It's okay, Mama.

57:45.524 --> 57:51.463
I was playing with this and
I don't know what happened.

57:51.497 --> 57:53.265
How many times
do I have to tell you

57:53.299 --> 57:55.134
not to play
with this violent game?

57:56.068 --> 57:57.036
Huh?

57:57.069 --> 57:59.905
Who gave you this?
Who fucking gave you this?

58:00.806 --> 58:01.907
Chris let me borrow it.

58:01.941 --> 58:04.944
Well, tomorrow at school
you take it right back to him.

58:04.977 --> 58:07.046
Okay? You hear me?

58:10.149 --> 58:11.417
- <i>Si?</i>
- <i>Si.</i>

58:24.029 --> 58:25.164
<i>Perdon.</i>

58:33.339 --> 58:34.340
I got an idea.

58:36.208 --> 58:37.443
Did you finish your homework?

58:39.111 --> 58:40.779
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah?

58:43.015 --> 58:46.085
Why don't we go try this place
that Tia Arianne told us about?

58:48.354 --> 58:49.421
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

58:49.455 --> 58:50.856
- Okay.
- It sounds good.

58:50.889 --> 58:52.358
Yeah. Let's go.

59:04.203 --> 59:05.204
Mm.

59:06.138 --> 59:08.240
Looks so good but I'm so full.

59:08.274 --> 59:09.908
Well,
I can make you a bacon sandwich

59:09.942 --> 59:11.243
with the leftovers tomorrow.

59:11.277 --> 59:12.444
- That sound good?
- Mm-hm.

59:13.445 --> 59:15.981
I'm gonna run to the restroom.
Stay right here.

59:16.015 --> 59:17.116
Okay.

59:23.522 --> 59:25.791
Hi, there.
How's everything so far?

59:26.325 --> 59:27.493
Oh, so good.

59:27.526 --> 59:28.961
You ready for me
to take anything?

59:28.994 --> 59:31.864
- Um, just these.
- All righty.

59:35.367 --> 59:37.269
All right, buddy.
How about another milkshake?

59:37.303 --> 59:38.871
It looks like
you finished this one.

59:38.904 --> 59:40.906
Yeah. Quick
before my mom gets back.

1:00:01.060 --> 1:00:02.328
- I forgot to tell you something.
- Mm-hm.

1:00:02.361 --> 1:00:04.463
Mr. B said he entered our
music group into a talent show.

1:00:05.431 --> 1:00:06.598
That's fun.

1:00:07.533 --> 1:00:08.600
Where's it gonna be?

1:00:08.634 --> 1:00:09.535
Well, he said here,

1:00:09.568 --> 1:00:10.804
but if we win that round
and a couple more,

1:00:10.836 --> 1:00:13.972
we can go to New York and
perform in front of everyone.

1:00:14.006 --> 1:00:15.574
We have to make
our own original song,

1:00:15.607 --> 1:00:17.309
and we have to play our
instruments and everything.

1:00:18.410 --> 1:00:20.079
Wow.

1:00:20.112 --> 1:00:21.380
That's... that's amazing.

1:00:23.182 --> 1:00:25.250
So you better
start practicing...

1:00:25.284 --> 1:00:28.020
Yeah, when we get home,
I'll practice them all.

1:00:28.053 --> 1:00:29.421
Have you been
to New York before?

1:00:31.223 --> 1:00:32.891
- Huh?
- Have you been to New York?

1:00:36.328 --> 1:00:38.263
- Get down. Get down.
- What?

1:00:39.031 --> 1:00:40.265
Let's go.

1:00:40.299 --> 1:00:41.934
Get down. Get down.

1:00:41.967 --> 1:00:43.102
- What?
- Get out of here.

1:00:58.650 --> 1:01:00.619
Come here. Come here.

1:01:30.282 --> 1:01:32.718
- Mama, Mama, stop it.
- Let go now!

1:01:32.752 --> 1:01:34.553
Hey, stop,
don't touch her.

1:01:34.586 --> 1:01:36.955
You're insane.

1:01:36.989 --> 1:01:38.457
- Mama! Don't touch her.
- Stop it.

1:01:38.490 --> 1:01:41.093
- You can't put me away...
- We're gonna need you to...

1:01:41.126 --> 1:01:44.296
- Son, you need to calm down.
- Mama!

1:01:44.329 --> 1:01:46.498
- Calm down.
- Carlos! Carlos!

1:01:48.133 --> 1:01:49.334
- Mama.
- Carlos.

1:01:49.368 --> 1:01:52.070
Mama, Mama. Stop.

1:01:52.104 --> 1:01:54.706
- Let her go.
- Son, you need to calm down.

1:01:54.741 --> 1:01:57.075
<i>...seized along
with a small amount of cocaine...</i>

1:02:24.636 --> 1:02:29.374
Thank God there's only so much they can
pull out of this dusty old brain of mine.

1:02:33.178 --> 1:02:34.346
Hey, come over here.

1:02:37.683 --> 1:02:38.684
Hey.

1:02:49.294 --> 1:02:50.596
What do you want?

1:02:52.498 --> 1:02:53.699
A companion.

1:02:57.804 --> 1:03:00.472
Not you. I just meant
in general.

1:03:02.174 --> 1:03:03.175
Oh.

1:03:04.710 --> 1:03:06.211
I want your teeth.

1:03:09.281 --> 1:03:10.315
You'll hardly miss 'em.

1:03:12.317 --> 1:03:13.685
What the fuck? Go away from me.

1:03:17.757 --> 1:03:19.391
Just messing with you.

1:03:20.325 --> 1:03:22.060
You got a twisted cuspid.

1:03:23.228 --> 1:03:24.563
I can do way better than that.

1:03:26.298 --> 1:03:27.666
They do that to your face?

1:03:28.768 --> 1:03:29.769
No.

1:03:30.837 --> 1:03:32.739
This is all my own doing.

1:03:35.274 --> 1:03:36.275
Why?

1:03:37.309 --> 1:03:38.310
Well...

1:03:39.311 --> 1:03:42.147
When you have a fear like mine,

1:03:42.180 --> 1:03:43.615
you don't really have a choice.

1:03:53.458 --> 1:03:55.294
You want to hear about
what happened to me?

1:03:58.798 --> 1:03:59.899
As you know, the Ronaldo Group

1:03:59.933 --> 1:04:02.802
is the number one architecture
firm in the country.

1:04:02.835 --> 1:04:04.837
And I've been their top guy
for over a year.

1:04:04.871 --> 1:04:06.238
I just wanted to mix it up,
and, uh,

1:04:06.271 --> 1:04:09.341
I don't think moving here to
Boucher would feel like a step back

1:04:09.374 --> 1:04:11.510
since I get to work
with all these lovely ladies.

1:04:13.813 --> 1:04:15.113
I mean women.

1:04:18.150 --> 1:04:20.085
I mean female architects.

1:04:21.888 --> 1:04:23.488
Uh...

1:04:29.862 --> 1:04:31.163
What's with the gloves?

1:04:33.265 --> 1:04:35.567
Oh, I wear these while
I'm working on the models

1:04:35.601 --> 1:04:37.703
and the office is always
so cold.

1:04:38.838 --> 1:04:41.306
I've just been leaving them on.

1:04:41.340 --> 1:04:42.341
Yeah.

1:04:43.642 --> 1:04:45.845
Thanks for coming
in such late notice.

1:04:46.712 --> 1:04:47.747
Mister...

1:04:48.748 --> 1:04:50.248
McNerney.

1:04:52.284 --> 1:04:53.485
Yeah.

1:04:56.488 --> 1:04:57.522
- We'll be in touch.
- Yeah.

1:05:14.807 --> 1:05:16.308
Oh!

1:05:24.751 --> 1:05:25.952
Yeah.

1:05:25.985 --> 1:05:27.754
<i>It's Mr. Boucher
on the other line for you.</i>

1:05:30.522 --> 1:05:32.591
Put him through.

1:05:32.624 --> 1:05:36.395
<i>This Steinhardt proposal
is a complete fucking disaster.</i>

1:05:36.428 --> 1:05:37.730
What's the problem?

1:05:37.764 --> 1:05:39.766
<i>The calculations
were off six degrees</i>

1:05:39.799 --> 1:05:42.267
<i>and now half the roof
is in the ground.</i>

1:05:42.300 --> 1:05:44.837
- What?
- <i>You heard me.</i>

1:05:46.371 --> 1:05:48.808
- Okay.
- <i>This isn't rocket science.</i>

1:05:48.841 --> 1:05:51.543
<i>Get those girls' heads out
of their asses and fix it.</i>

1:05:51.576 --> 1:05:52.879
I'll take care of it
right away.

1:05:52.912 --> 1:05:56.381
<i>Jesus. You have no sense of
direction, just like your mother.</i>

1:05:58.350 --> 1:06:00.585
Dad, this is the first
I'm hearing of it.

1:06:00.619 --> 1:06:01.720
And I'm sorry.

1:06:11.931 --> 1:06:14.633
<i>Yes, Ms. Boucher?</i>

1:06:14.666 --> 1:06:16.803
I need everyone from
the Steinhardt team

1:06:16.836 --> 1:06:20.372
in the conference room with all
the project materials right away.

1:06:20.405 --> 1:06:21.640
<i>I'll send them right in.</i>

1:06:28.513 --> 1:06:30.716
We have a serious problem.

1:06:30.750 --> 1:06:33.618
We know. We hadn't anticipated the
Brocol group pulling this imminent...

1:06:33.652 --> 1:06:36.421
I'm not talking about Brocol.

1:06:36.455 --> 1:06:38.891
The foundation's
calculations are off.

1:06:38.925 --> 1:06:40.625
Uh, the surveyor reported...

1:06:40.659 --> 1:06:43.295
I'm not talking
about boundary lines.

1:06:43.328 --> 1:06:46.631
- Our crew...
- I'm not talking about boundary lines.

1:06:46.665 --> 1:06:48.000
Our crew measured
multiple times.

1:06:50.702 --> 1:06:53.305
What's gonna happen
to the roof

1:06:53.906 --> 1:06:56.408
if the structure slopes

1:06:56.441 --> 1:07:01.881
an additional six degrees
toward the ground?

1:07:01.914 --> 1:07:03.615
We'll be that much closer
to Kevin Bacon?

1:07:07.385 --> 1:07:08.821
Get the fuck out of my office!

1:07:08.855 --> 1:07:09.989
I was kidding.

1:07:10.022 --> 1:07:11.958
Get the fuck out of my office!

1:07:11.991 --> 1:07:13.059
It was a joke.

1:07:13.092 --> 1:07:15.694
Get the fuck out of my office!

1:07:18.731 --> 1:07:21.934
Um... the
measurements taken on May 16th

1:07:21.968 --> 1:07:25.403
are congruent with the data
collected on June 3rd.

1:07:25.437 --> 1:07:27.672
And we made sure
to accompany the crew.

1:07:27.706 --> 1:07:29.942
And what were the findings?

1:07:29.976 --> 1:07:32.477
Um, we did mark a discrepancy
in our numbers.

1:07:34.013 --> 1:07:36.381
Well, what matters now
is that we fix it.

1:07:38.416 --> 1:07:39.351
I'm going home.

1:07:39.384 --> 1:07:43.455
I expect you there
with a plan in place.

1:07:43.488 --> 1:07:45.825
We'll stay up all night
if we have to.

1:07:45.858 --> 1:07:47.692
No one rests
till this is resolved.

1:07:48.795 --> 1:07:49.896
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

1:07:50.662 --> 1:07:51.696
It went really well.

1:07:51.731 --> 1:07:53.565
I mean, I think we were
vibing a little bit, too.

1:07:53.598 --> 1:07:55.367
- That's great.
- Yeah.

1:07:55.400 --> 1:07:58.637
I mean, you'd be the first guy
we've had in a while.

1:07:58.670 --> 1:07:59.671
That right?

1:07:59.704 --> 1:08:02.607
Yeah. She likes her employees
young and pretty.

1:08:03.976 --> 1:08:05.912
Well, that explains
why you're here.

1:08:05.945 --> 1:08:07.914
Um, but...

1:08:07.947 --> 1:08:09.816
you don't want to get
on her bad side.

1:08:11.851 --> 1:08:14.386
One wrong move and
you're out of here.

1:08:15.922 --> 1:08:17.722
Yeah. Excommunicated.

1:08:18.456 --> 1:08:20.725
Buried and never
heard from again.

1:08:21.961 --> 1:08:24.629
Mr. McNerney.
You're hired.

1:08:24.663 --> 1:08:26.565
Uh, wow. Um, thank you.

1:08:26.598 --> 1:08:29.634
Lia and Natalie will update you
in the conference room

1:08:29.668 --> 1:08:31.938
and I expect you three
at my house later tonight.

1:08:31.971 --> 1:08:33.840
Yeah. No, you got it.

1:08:34.539 --> 1:08:35.574
Thank you again.

1:09:35.201 --> 1:09:36.769
- Take your shoes off.
- Okay.

1:09:38.536 --> 1:09:40.940
Wow, groovy place.

1:09:41.741 --> 1:09:42.775
You still cold?

1:09:44.509 --> 1:09:45.845
Yeah.

1:09:45.878 --> 1:09:47.545
Brr.

1:09:49.648 --> 1:09:50.983
Do you mind if I put this down?

1:09:51.017 --> 1:09:52.717
No, no, no.

1:09:52.752 --> 1:09:55.121
Why don't you set it in here
on the coffee table?

1:09:55.154 --> 1:09:56.789
You're gonna help yourselves
to something to eat,

1:09:56.822 --> 1:09:57.957
and we're gonna get to work.

1:10:01.160 --> 1:10:02.762
We think we found a solution.

1:10:02.795 --> 1:10:04.764
It might even cut our costs.

1:11:07.793 --> 1:11:09.862
I'm so sorry.

1:11:09.895 --> 1:11:12.131
That's okay.
Stay right there, I'll get it.

1:11:12.798 --> 1:11:14.734
I can't...

1:17:04.249 --> 1:17:06.452
- Gross.
- Oh.

1:17:06.485 --> 1:17:07.986
You're awake.

1:17:09.388 --> 1:17:10.656
Oh, goodie.

1:17:10.689 --> 1:17:13.292
I am so excited

1:17:13.325 --> 1:17:15.461
to show you this
now that it's ready.

1:17:16.228 --> 1:17:18.063
It's time for
the maiden voyage.

1:17:19.565 --> 1:17:20.966
Come on, Johnny. Get in.

1:17:22.668 --> 1:17:24.036
Get up!

1:17:28.974 --> 1:17:32.578
Let's go. We're gonna take this
for a little bit of spin.

1:17:33.545 --> 1:17:35.314
Stay!

1:17:39.385 --> 1:17:41.019
I'm not gonna be much help.

1:17:42.020 --> 1:17:44.056
Why would you say that?

1:17:44.089 --> 1:17:46.158
I thought you would want
to be part of history.

1:17:46.658 --> 1:17:47.960
Help!

1:17:50.596 --> 1:17:52.331
They're not gonna
help you, Johnny.

1:17:54.032 --> 1:17:55.200
Help!

1:18:02.107 --> 1:18:04.276
Your cooperation is greatly
appreciated, Johnny.

1:18:04.811 --> 1:18:06.145
Thank you very much.

1:18:10.416 --> 1:18:12.351
- How's your dad going?
- He hanging in there.

1:18:20.292 --> 1:18:21.960
<i>What are you
going to do?</i>

1:18:21.994 --> 1:18:23.162
<i>Stop the bad things.</i>

1:18:24.696 --> 1:18:26.131
Don't fucking
look at me like that.

1:18:27.734 --> 1:18:29.101
No!

1:18:30.335 --> 1:18:31.570
<i>Find me another.</i>

1:18:46.318 --> 1:18:47.352
What the hell!

1:18:49.588 --> 1:18:51.323
You tortured my father.

1:18:54.293 --> 1:18:56.395
And I have taken care of him
every single day

1:18:56.428 --> 1:18:58.330
since he came back
from this place.

1:19:01.700 --> 1:19:03.035
Rot in hell.

1:19:07.506 --> 1:19:09.174
We need to get out
of this place.

1:19:20.552 --> 1:19:22.654
Move, move!

1:19:35.768 --> 1:19:38.270
You all find a way out.
I'll stay with him.

1:19:38.303 --> 1:19:39.806
Where the fuck are we?

1:19:39.839 --> 1:19:41.741
It's a government
testing facility.

1:19:41.774 --> 1:19:45.310
They've been using your fears to
infect and control the population.

1:19:46.378 --> 1:19:47.780
They're weaponizing fear?

1:19:47.814 --> 1:19:49.581
Against their our own country?

1:19:51.583 --> 1:19:52.785
We need to get out of here.

1:19:58.690 --> 1:20:00.092
I have an idea.

1:20:03.095 --> 1:20:04.096
Go, go, go.

1:20:06.331 --> 1:20:08.100
Dr. Wright!

1:20:27.219 --> 1:20:29.121
Get off of me!

1:20:31.824 --> 1:20:33.325
What... what is that?

1:20:33.358 --> 1:20:34.626
What's going on?

1:20:37.462 --> 1:20:39.164
Get off, get off!
Get him off!

1:20:44.603 --> 1:20:45.838
Get him off me!
