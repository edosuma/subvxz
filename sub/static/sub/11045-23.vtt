00:05.439 --> 00:08.040
Well, that's the last
of it, Filthy Rich.

00:08.042 --> 00:13.145
Just Rich, please. And on behalf
of Rich's Barnyard Bargains,

00:13.147 --> 00:17.016
thanks for another season's
shipment of Zap Apple Jam.

00:17.018 --> 00:18.650
Our pleasure. See
ya next time!

00:22.489 --> 00:25.791
Uh, Apple Bloom? Did you pack up
the cider into the same crates

00:25.793 --> 00:27.693
as the Zap Apple Jam?

00:27.695 --> 00:30.229
Sure did! Now that
I'm getting older,

00:30.231 --> 00:33.665
I want to prove I can handle
more responsibility on the farm.

00:33.667 --> 00:35.634
But the crates aren't marked.

00:35.636 --> 00:38.604
You kept track of what when
into which crate, right?

00:38.606 --> 00:44.343
Oh. Um... Yep. I totally
kept track of everything.

00:44.345 --> 00:47.479
Good. Because we wouldn't want
Filthy Rich to get a shipment

00:47.481 --> 00:50.449
of cider when he's supposed
to get Zap Apple Jam.

00:50.451 --> 00:52.618
You know how Granny
feels about selling cider

00:52.620 --> 00:54.686
anywhere but
on the farm.

00:54.688 --> 00:57.222
Are you sure he
got the right crates?

00:57.224 --> 00:59.758
Sure, I'm sure!

00:59.760 --> 01:02.528
Now why don't you and Big
Mac head on out to the house

01:02.530 --> 01:03.796
and let me finish up here!

01:06.800 --> 01:10.536
If you gave Rich the Zap Apple
Jam, then what's this here?

01:10.538 --> 01:13.305

of cider, right? Because
I would never do that.

02:04.291 --> 02:07.526
Don't worry. We know
exactly whose fault it was.

02:13.299 --> 02:16.735
Now, why in tarnation would
you lie to me, Apple Bloom?

02:16.737 --> 02:20.305
I was kinda hoping I could fix
it before anypony found out.

02:20.307 --> 02:24.143
Telling lies won't fix
anything. Trust me, I know.

02:24.145 --> 02:25.911
What could you
possibly know about it?

02:25.913 --> 02:28.413
You've never told a
lie in your whole life.

02:28.415 --> 02:35.320
[laughing]

02:35.322 --> 02:40.792
Oh, sugar cube, your
big sister lied so much

02:40.794 --> 02:44.663
when she was a filly, the whole
family ended up in the hospital.

02:44.665 --> 02:45.864
WHAT?!

02:45.866 --> 02:47.566
Eeyup.

02:47.568 --> 02:50.636
[sigh] You might as well
tell her the whole story.

02:50.638 --> 02:52.771
It might even do
her some good.

02:52.773 --> 02:56.375
When Applejack and Big Mac
were just a wee bit older

02:56.377 --> 02:59.511
than you are now, they
both kept squabblin' over

02:59.513 --> 03:01.847
who would run
the farm better.

03:03.650 --> 03:07.219
All I'm sayin' is that you
may have plenty of brawn,

03:07.221 --> 03:09.655
but I'm the one with the
ideas on how to run things

03:09.657 --> 03:10.956
better around here.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.725
Applejack, Applejack,
Applejack.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.694
Ideas are all
well and good,

03:15.696 --> 03:17.863
but you can't plow
a field with them.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.499
I don't know how many
times I've told you that.

03:20.501 --> 03:25.270
You two horned toads better stop
jabberin' and get to workin'!

03:25.272 --> 03:28.674
Yeah they'd better! I
need you to go to town.

03:28.676 --> 03:31.910
The apple blight's been awful
and if we don't get more spray,

03:31.912 --> 03:34.846
cider season'll be shorter
than a dwarf crab-apple tree.

03:34.848 --> 03:41.386
now there's a pony who knows how
to put his back into a problem.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.522
[growl]

03:43.524 --> 03:45.691
Oh hi there, Filthy Rich!

03:45.693 --> 03:47.526
Just Rich, please.

03:47.528 --> 03:51.330
And I'd like you to meet
my fiancée, Spoiled Milk.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.932
Honey, this is
Applejack and Big Mac,

03:53.934 --> 03:56.802
the two hardest-working
ponies at Sweet Apple Acres.

03:58.338 --> 04:02.608
You work on a farm?
How... quaint.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.843
Oh ho now,
dear, be nice.

04:04.845 --> 04:07.346
Sweet Apple Acres
makes Zap Apple Jam.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.948
It's one of Dad's
best-sellers.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.784
You mean one of
your best-sellers.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.020
My amazing husband-to-be
is running the

04:15.022 --> 04:20.392
Rich family business now. Did
you know that? Well, now you do.

04:20.394 --> 04:23.729
Don't mind Spoiled Milk.
She's just proud of me.

04:23.731 --> 04:26.898
But she's right; I'm in
charge of the store now

04:26.900 --> 04:29.868
and I'm just bursting
with ideas I wanna try.

04:29.870 --> 04:35.274
Well, how about this? Cider
season's around the corner.

04:35.276 --> 04:37.876
Why not let me
sell it for you?

04:37.878 --> 04:40.545
That is an
interesting idea.

04:40.547 --> 04:43.382
Well, maybe it's interesting
and maybe it ain't,

04:43.384 --> 04:45.617
but it's definitely
not a new idea.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.753
Granny Smith told us your
grandpa, Stinkin' Rich,

04:47.755 --> 04:50.455
used to ask her every year
if he could sell our cider

04:50.457 --> 04:53.025
in your store, and Granny
told him every year

04:53.027 --> 04:55.294
about the tradition of
everypony in Ponyville

04:55.296 --> 04:57.329
lining up out at
Sweet Apple Acres.

04:57.331 --> 04:59.598
So, start a new tradition!

04:59.600 --> 05:01.933
Someday one of you'll
take over the farm

05:01.935 --> 05:04.636
just like I've taken
over the store.

05:04.638 --> 05:08.840
I'm guessing it'll be the
one with the best ideas.

05:08.842 --> 05:12.077
Well, now, as I've said
many a time before,

05:12.079 --> 05:15.047
ideas are all well and good,
but you can't plow a field--

05:15.049 --> 05:17.883
You know what? How about
we give you three barrels

05:17.885 --> 05:20.319
of cider early, and
if it sells well,

05:20.321 --> 05:21.920
we'll make a deal
for the rest.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.489
Oh, hey now! Perfect!

05:24.491 --> 05:27.793
Come on, honey. I've got
to get everything ready.

05:27.795 --> 05:31.863
Hoo-wee, I tell ya, if the
future means me running

05:31.865 --> 05:35.967
Sweet Apple Acres and you
being quiet, I can't wait!

05:39.372 --> 05:42.441
I just can't believe you'd
make a deal with Filthy Rich

05:42.443 --> 05:44.376
without even talking to Granny.

05:44.378 --> 05:47.079
Aw, Granny will love the
idea and then she'll decide

05:47.081 --> 05:50.115
that I'm the one who should
take over the farm. You'll see.

05:50.117 --> 05:52.551
Granny: See what?

05:52.553 --> 05:56.388
Applejack here had another
one of her "big ideas,"

05:56.390 --> 05:58.690
and I think we all know my
position on ideas, you...

05:58.692 --> 06:01.626
...can't plow a
field with them.

06:01.628 --> 06:03.628
Right.

06:03.630 --> 06:05.964
Big idea, huh?

06:07.533 --> 06:09.735
Actually, more of
an opportunity.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.970
You see, we ran into
Filthy Rich in town.

06:11.972 --> 06:14.139
Did you know he's running
the family store now?

06:14.141 --> 06:16.508
And what does this
here "opportunity"

06:16.510 --> 06:19.010
mean for Sweet
Apple Acres?

06:19.012 --> 06:23.882
Well, since cider season is
almost here, he or, I mean,

06:23.884 --> 06:27.586
I thought it'd be a good idea to
give him a few barrels of cider

06:27.588 --> 06:29.988
to sell at the store
before the season starts.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.890
Oh, is that all?

06:33.393 --> 06:35.961
Absolutely not!

06:35.963 --> 06:36.995
Hmmm.

06:40.500 --> 06:44.436
But Granny, why can't we sell
a few barrels of cider early

06:44.438 --> 06:47.539
to Filthy Rich? How's it any
different than when you gave

06:47.541 --> 06:50.542
Zap Apple Jam to Filthy's
grandpappy to sell?

06:50.544 --> 06:54.112
Your cider and your jam
ain't the same thing!

06:54.114 --> 06:57.048
Zap Apple Jam jars preserve
the flavor for moons,

06:57.050 --> 06:58.917
but cider starts to spoil

06:58.919 --> 07:01.119
the second it comes
out of the press.

07:01.121 --> 07:04.990
That is why every cider season,
all of Ponyville lines up

07:04.992 --> 07:08.727
at Sweet Apple Acres and first
come is first served. Hmm!

07:08.729 --> 07:10.762
I get what you're
saying, Granny,

07:10.764 --> 07:13.965
but couldn't you make an
exception just this once?

07:13.967 --> 07:16.568
I sorta promised.

07:16.570 --> 07:21.907
Meh-eh. Besides, cider-makin'
is iffy business.

07:21.909 --> 07:24.142
And we're probably not gonna
have a lot this year anyway,

07:24.144 --> 07:30.115
I'm sorry, Applejack, but
you'll have to un-promise.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.750
Oh!

07:33.886 --> 07:36.755
I hate to say I told
you so, Applejack, but--

07:36.757 --> 07:40.492
You and I both know you
don't hate to say anything.

07:40.494 --> 07:43.028
Well, I've always thought
that the most important thing

07:43.030 --> 07:45.597
a pony can do is say
exactly what's on his mind

07:45.599 --> 07:48.467
to anypony who'll listen
so everypony everywhere

07:48.469 --> 07:50.535
always knows everything
you're thinking and...

07:50.537 --> 07:53.205
And you don't ever have to
listen to anypony else.

07:53.207 --> 07:54.973
What?

07:54.975 --> 07:56.208
Exactly.

07:58.945 --> 08:02.481
Well, if it ain't my
new business partner!

08:02.483 --> 08:05.116
Um, about the
cider, Rich...

08:05.118 --> 08:08.520
Take a look at what I did last
night after we made our deal.

08:10.189 --> 08:12.858
Woo! Pretty great, huh?

08:12.860 --> 08:16.628
The thing is, I don't
think I can get you any.

08:16.630 --> 08:20.899
What?! But I did all
this work on your say-so.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.834
We shook hooves and
everything.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.870
Well, you see, at
Sweet Apple Acres,

08:24.872 --> 08:28.139
we've always been about quality
and while your basic jam jar'll-

08:28.141 --> 08:30.175
Plus it's been a tough
harvest this year,

08:30.177 --> 08:32.210
what with all the
blight.

08:32.212 --> 08:35.981
Sounds to me like you're
trying to make excuses.

08:35.983 --> 08:40.185
Whenever Granddad dealt with
Granny Smith, she kept her word.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.954
If you can't do that,
then maybe our families

08:42.956 --> 08:46.024
should stop doing business
together. Altogether!

08:47.927 --> 08:51.963
Now, now, the thing is, Rich,
it ain't really up to us.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.598
You see, Granny's--

08:53.600 --> 08:58.036
Wait. Granny's
sick? I had no idea!

08:58.038 --> 09:01.873
Yeah, nopony did.

09:01.875 --> 09:05.310
What Big Mac means is we've
been trying to keep it quiet.

09:05.312 --> 09:07.178
We don't want people
to make rash decisions

09:07.180 --> 09:12.083
just because we're a little
short-hooved at the moment.

09:12.085 --> 09:16.855
Oh my! Of course, of
course. I am so sorry.

09:16.857 --> 09:20.692
Please let me know if
there's anything I can do.

09:20.694 --> 09:24.262
Much appreciated. But
right now, we only ask

09:24.264 --> 09:27.265
for your understanding
during this difficult time.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.134
Mm hm.

09:29.136 --> 09:35.740
but instead you made things
worse with a giant lie!

09:35.742 --> 09:39.077
Well, what was I supposed
to do? You heard Rich.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.680
If I told him the truth, he
was gonna stop doing business

09:41.682 --> 09:43.648
with us altogether.

09:43.650 --> 09:45.283
Yeah, but that's
only because--

09:45.285 --> 09:48.219
I forgot to ask if we
had any oat crumbles

09:48.221 --> 09:50.622
for this delicious-looking
salad, Granny!

09:51.891 --> 09:53.024
I'll go take a look.

09:55.061 --> 09:57.295
--that was only because you made
promises you couldn't keep,

09:57.297 --> 09:59.798
but there's gotta be a
better way out of this mess

09:59.800 --> 10:02.601
than by making up some story
about Granny being sick!

10:02.603 --> 10:03.735
Well, it worked, didn't it?

10:03.737 --> 10:05.804
[knock at door]

10:05.806 --> 10:08.373
Sorry to drop by unannounced.

10:08.375 --> 10:12.344
We just wanted to come by to
wish Granny a speedy recovery.

10:12.346 --> 10:17.315
Look, sis, our good friend Mr.
Rich and his fiancée are here.

10:17.317 --> 10:21.086
Oh, and they brought
flowers. For Granny.

10:21.088 --> 10:25.624
On account of she's sick, like
you said. Ain't that sweet?

10:27.393 --> 10:28.960
Uh, excuse me one second!

10:28.962 --> 10:30.095
[slam]

10:30.097 --> 10:31.396
[crash]

10:31.398 --> 10:34.666
What in tarnation?!

10:34.668 --> 10:37.268
Oh, I'm sorry, Granny.
I didn't see you there.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.037
You came blasting in so fast,

10:39.039 --> 10:41.773
t'weren't possible
to see nothin'!

10:41.775 --> 10:45.777
I, uh, I think we might
have left a blight sprayer

10:45.779 --> 10:51.282
Are you outta your apple-pickin'
mind? It's suppertime, girl!

10:51.284 --> 10:53.885
I know, but if we
forgot a sprayer,

10:53.887 --> 10:56.021
I'd wanna get it before
dark. You go start counting

10:56.023 --> 10:59.157
and I'll tell Big Mac
we'll be right back, OK?

10:59.159 --> 11:00.291
[slam]

11:00.293 --> 11:03.962
So from that moment on, I
took to referring to myself

11:03.964 --> 11:07.065
as Big or Large or--

11:07.067 --> 11:09.934
Oh Applejack, your brother
was just explaining

11:09.936 --> 11:12.704
why he always wears his yoke.

11:12.706 --> 11:16.274
Even though we asked him how
your grandmare is doing.

11:16.276 --> 11:19.678
Oh, you know how Big
Mac can get to talking,

11:19.680 --> 11:22.013
especially when he's
upset. And right now,

11:22.015 --> 11:24.749
he's just as worried about
Granny Smith as I am.

11:24.751 --> 11:25.850
[door closes]

11:26.952 --> 11:29.854
Oh dear. Is she doing that bad?

11:29.856 --> 11:31.890
Well, one thing's for sure,

11:31.892 --> 11:33.892
she shouldn't be seeing
anypony right now.

11:35.995 --> 11:39.230
In fact, I'm getting more
upset just thinking about it.

11:39.232 --> 11:40.465
Excuse me!

11:41.835 --> 11:46.438
Oh, what in the frilly
fumidila has gotten into you?!

11:46.440 --> 11:49.441
Sorry, Granny! I just
decided if I helped you,

11:49.443 --> 11:53.978
Well, you're too late.
All the sprayers are here.

11:56.882 --> 12:00.251
Oh, good. Uh say, Granny,

12:00.253 --> 12:03.421
when did you first fight
the apple blight again?

12:03.423 --> 12:07.759
It was my second year
here in Ponyville

12:07.761 --> 12:12.363
and that was before I had
the rick on the one knee.

12:12.365 --> 12:16.234
...and others say that's how the
trees got to growing so tall,

12:16.236 --> 12:19.738
but to me, it's just
how I got my cutie mark.

12:19.740 --> 12:23.374
But we asked when we could
come back to see Granny!

12:23.376 --> 12:26.311
Big Mac didn't
want to be rude,

12:26.313 --> 12:30.849
but you just can't see Granny
right now because she's...

12:30.851 --> 12:35.987
[gasp] I thought only
trees got the blight.

12:35.989 --> 12:39.758
Yeah, that's
usually the case.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.860
The doctors think it's from
working in the orchard

12:41.862 --> 12:43.128
for so many years.

12:45.097 --> 12:48.533
You see. We had to take
Granny to Ponyville General.

12:48.535 --> 12:51.136
We just got back right
before you showed up.

12:51.138 --> 12:54.139
Oh my, that is terrible!

12:54.141 --> 12:57.475
Eww, it's not
contagious, is it?

12:57.477 --> 13:00.545
Um, I'm sure you'll be
fine, but you should leave,

13:00.547 --> 13:02.480
[cough] just in case.

13:04.550 --> 13:07.552
You're right. We're gonna have
to hurry if we want to get there

13:07.554 --> 13:10.255
before visiting hours are over.

13:10.257 --> 13:13.258
That's right. Wait. Get where?

13:13.260 --> 13:15.426
Why, the hospital, of course.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.162
I'm sure we'll see you there!

13:23.569 --> 13:25.503
Telling Filthy Rich that
Granny's in the hospital

13:25.505 --> 13:27.872
just made everything
a hundred times worse!

13:27.874 --> 13:29.340
What are we supposed to do now?

13:30.876 --> 13:32.010
I got it!

13:32.012 --> 13:35.814
...dropped my second best
teeth right in the pig pen

13:35.816 --> 13:40.151
and that was the worst case of
apple blight I've ever seen!

13:40.153 --> 13:41.853
I'd love to hear
more Granny,

13:41.855 --> 13:44.155
but we gotta get to the
hospital right away!

13:44.157 --> 13:47.192
The hospital?
Why, who's sick?

13:47.194 --> 13:49.460
You are, apparently.

13:49.462 --> 13:52.964
What he means is, you're
needed at the hospital.

13:52.966 --> 13:55.066
Whatever for?

13:56.402 --> 13:59.871
It's the apple blight! It's
starting to infect ponies now!

13:59.873 --> 14:03.141
The doctors need an expert
opinion, and nopony knows more

14:03.143 --> 14:06.211
about fighting blight
than Granny Smith!

14:06.213 --> 14:09.280
Well, what in tarnation are
we waiting for? Let's go!

14:17.623 --> 14:21.292
You know, we're supposed
to go in the back.

14:21.294 --> 14:24.495
Uh, to avoid anypony in the
waiting room with the blight.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.268
Oops, I almost forgot!

14:33.974 --> 14:37.876
Now you don't have to worry
about catching the blight.

14:37.878 --> 14:39.911
If you say so, dearie.

14:39.913 --> 14:44.382
Now you wait right here while
I... check on your presentation.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.885
What in the rotten
rhubarb's going on here?

14:48.587 --> 14:51.256
Fancy meeting you two here!

14:51.258 --> 14:53.591
Well, we told you
we were coming.

14:53.593 --> 14:57.395
Oh, I'm glad we found you
because I can't seem to find

14:57.397 --> 15:00.431
Granny's room, or any
nurses who've even heard

15:00.433 --> 15:03.034
about a pony with
apple blight.

15:03.036 --> 15:06.537
Granny's room. Sure. Just
go down here, take a left,

15:06.539 --> 15:09.307
then a right, go down some
stairs, up a bunch more stairs,

15:09.309 --> 15:11.576
through the cafeteria,
left three more times

15:11.578 --> 15:16.080
and then you're there. Easy as
Granny's apple pie! Heh heh.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.283
Aren't you coming with us?

15:18.285 --> 15:20.518
I'll catch up! I
gotta find Big Mac.

15:22.688 --> 15:26.457
OK, Granny, just wait here
one second and we can go.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.126
Where are you
two going?

15:28.128 --> 15:30.161
Big Mac can't come.
He, uh...

15:30.163 --> 15:31.596
...might be contagious.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.097
Both: Contagious?

15:36.168 --> 15:38.336
All right. Climb up here
and I'll cover you up.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.338
Then I'll bring Rich in,
tell him you're Granny,

15:40.340 --> 15:42.373
but you're not allowed
to take the sheets off.

15:42.375 --> 15:45.243
You moan a few times, he leaves,
and this whole thing is over.

15:45.245 --> 15:48.079
This is spinnin' way out
of control, Applejack!

15:48.081 --> 15:50.281
Now I know you thought selling
cider in Filthy's store

15:50.283 --> 15:53.351
was a good idea, but it
ain't worth lying to him

15:53.353 --> 15:56.354
about Granny being sick and
needin' to go to the hospital,

15:56.356 --> 15:58.690
or fibbin' to Granny about
them wanting her to come here

15:58.692 --> 16:00.425
to talk about the blight, or--

16:00.427 --> 16:04.295
BIG McIntosh, PLEASE JUST
LISTEN TO ME FOR ONCE!

16:04.297 --> 16:06.297
This ain't about my ideas!

16:06.299 --> 16:08.366
If Rich finds out
about all the lies,

16:08.368 --> 16:11.135
he'll cut ties with us and
the farm will go under.

16:11.137 --> 16:14.038
Now do you want that to
happen or do you wanna help?

16:14.040 --> 16:16.074
Why can't you be Granny?
You're her size,

16:16.076 --> 16:18.209
and this is all your fault
in the first place!

16:18.211 --> 16:20.478
I would, but if I let
you do the talkin',

16:20.480 --> 16:22.714
you'd just ramble on and on
until we all got caught.

Granny!

It's about time. What
is going on around here?

16:44.604 --> 16:48.006
Granny, they need you to wait
here. I'll come get you.

been going in circles

16:55.015 --> 16:58.249
Well, you're in luck, 'cause
it's, it's right over here

You two, don't lose
that gurney!

Granny, what're you doin'? You
were supposed to stay there!

17:30.550 --> 17:33.184
It was a supply closet!

Oh! Uh, well, OK, come
with me, but be quiet.

closer without a gown and mask.

But-- but-but that's

Ellen? Did she say
"apple blight?"

I think she said
"gasket mites."

And once the trunk
turns red like this,

Well, sure. What
else you gonna do

Big Mac?

Granny Smith? What is
going on here, Applejack?

19:13.453 --> 19:15.820
That is a darn
good question.

19:18.390 --> 19:21.259
I'm not sure if I was worried
that nopony was listening

19:21.261 --> 19:24.162
to my ideas or just nervous
that I wouldn't be the one

19:24.164 --> 19:25.763
to end up running the farm,

19:25.765 --> 19:28.266
but I promised
something to Filthy Rich

19:28.268 --> 19:32.336
that I couldn't deliver and I
was too embarrassed to admit it.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.805
So Granny was never sick?

And there ain't no
apple blight in ponies?

19:37.810 --> 19:39.710
Nope!

19:39.712 --> 19:43.648
Those were all lies. And I
thought if you found out,

19:43.650 --> 19:45.883
you'd stop doing
business with the farm,

19:45.885 --> 19:48.719
so I just kept
telling more.

19:48.721 --> 19:51.322
So, she's not a doctor?

19:51.324 --> 19:54.458
Please don't make Granny and
the farm suffer for what I did.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.827
This whole thing is my fault.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.963
That's not
entirely true.

19:58.965 --> 20:02.233
Maybe if I paid more attention
to what you had to say

20:02.235 --> 20:03.834
instead of talking
all the time,

20:03.836 --> 20:06.304
none of this would have
happened in the first place.

I hope you learned
something too.

21:02.996 --> 21:06.631
I sure did! I learned that
no pony starts out perfect

make a few mistakes

21:08.801 --> 21:10.735
to figure out who you are.

But I think the most
important thing I learned

is who really runs
Sweet Apple Acres...
