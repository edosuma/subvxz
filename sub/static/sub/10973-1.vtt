01:18.165 --> 01:21.375
It's 50 feet north of the waggon.

01:21.545 --> 01:24.960
Or was it 50 feet south of the waggon?

01:25.880 --> 01:28.050
I can't remember!

01:57.535 --> 01:59.370
You ain't gonna take my gold, mister!

01:59.540 --> 02:01.290
No, sir!

02:26.900 --> 02:28.690
Asshole.

02:34.660 --> 02:36.535
I'm gonna kill you, bitch.

02:43.915 --> 02:45.125
Damn you!

02:47.255 --> 02:48.505
Don't you leave me here!

02:48.670 --> 02:51.005
I'm gonna kill you
if l ever see you again!

02:51.174 --> 02:54.134
I'll kill you, so help me!

02:54.553 --> 02:57.972
I am gonna kill you, bitch!

04:31.691 --> 04:34.193
Five foot 8. Am l right?

04:36.029 --> 04:38.072
I ain't never wrong.

05:40.468 --> 05:43.012
That's a girl. Thanks very much.

05:48.727 --> 05:52.813
-How about a room?
-Whores next door.

05:57.360 --> 06:00.779
-Say that again.
-l say whores next door.

06:11.499 --> 06:14.293
Now, do you have a room available?

06:14.461 --> 06:18.380
Room in back. Yes, ma'am.
Coming up. Coming up, coming up.

06:18.548 --> 06:21.633
Katie, let's go get the lady
a room and a bath.

06:44.824 --> 06:46.909
Barkeep, l want a bottle of champagne.

06:47.077 --> 06:49.078
-Yes, sir.
-And don't you dare open it.

06:49.245 --> 06:51.371
I wanna know what I'm drinking.

06:56.336 --> 06:58.003
Wanna play poker, little lady?

06:58.171 --> 07:00.881
Looks like you're having a good time
playing with yourself.

07:02.050 --> 07:04.802
It's a very special pack.

07:04.969 --> 07:08.097
See, l put an ace in
every time l kill a man.

07:25.573 --> 07:27.533
Interested in first-class whisky?

07:27.700 --> 07:30.202
I also have very fine cigars,
India ink.

07:30.370 --> 07:33.372
-Perfume.
-Just shine my boots.

07:39.337 --> 07:41.004
John Herod owns that house.

07:41.798 --> 07:44.216
He gets 50 cents of every dollar
in this town.

07:45.885 --> 07:48.554
-What's the town get?
-lt gets to live.

07:53.226 --> 07:54.560
Another gun in town.

08:14.414 --> 08:16.540
-Hi, Scars.
-Shut up!

08:16.708 --> 08:18.750
Stand back.

08:52.118 --> 08:54.411
Well, that makes...

08:55.079 --> 08:57.039
...fifteen.

09:13.598 --> 09:15.974
I just got out of prison.

09:16.142 --> 09:18.227
Congratulations.

09:18.394 --> 09:21.188
I got 35 years,
but they let me out early.

09:21.356 --> 09:22.940
How long did you do this time?

09:23.566 --> 09:25.442
Three days.

09:26.653 --> 09:29.071
-You're pretty.
-You're not.

09:30.573 --> 09:33.742
-l need a woman.
-You need a bath.

09:42.669 --> 09:45.837
I'm so clumsy, I must be blind.

09:53.680 --> 09:57.182
Try to understand, we prayed to God
a man like you would come to help us.

09:57.350 --> 09:59.643
Well, maybe you should have
called your priest.

09:59.811 --> 10:02.312
-This is strictly business.
-l have this candelabra.

10:02.480 --> 10:04.481
-What are they worth?
-Two hundred dollars.

10:04.649 --> 10:08.443
Two hundred?
Not good enough. ls that it?

10:26.546 --> 10:29.548
Don't mind my daddy.
He's just stupid.

10:31.259 --> 10:34.094
You look like you been riding
a long time.

10:34.262 --> 10:36.722
Where have you come from?

10:36.889 --> 10:38.223
Are you here for the contest?

10:38.391 --> 10:42.060
Because I never seen
a woman carry a gun before.

10:42.228 --> 10:45.022
Bet you're a good shot.
Maybe you could--

10:48.735 --> 10:51.528
I guess I'd better go now.

11:57.095 --> 11:59.679
Gold teeth! I got some gold teeth.

11:59.847 --> 12:01.264
All sizes.

12:01.432 --> 12:04.601
Gold teeth!
I got uppers, l got lowers.

12:04.769 --> 12:06.561
You're wasting my time.

12:08.773 --> 12:12.192
Quiet!

12:13.444 --> 12:17.239
I now declare
the quick-draw competition open.

12:18.324 --> 12:23.912
Each man who enters the contest
will fight once a day.

12:24.080 --> 12:27.332
Anybody can challenge anybody.

12:28.209 --> 12:29.376
The time of the fight...

12:29.544 --> 12:31.753
-...will be pulled from a hat.
-Hey, sweetheart.

12:32.004 --> 12:35.507
-Hey.
-For the duration of the contest...

12:35.675 --> 12:37.884
-...every fighter is entitled...
-Here you go.

12:38.052 --> 12:39.928
...to whatever he wants...

12:40.096 --> 12:42.597
-...courtesy of Mr. Herod.
-All right!

12:42.765 --> 12:46.476
But the man who wins the contest
gets this:

12:47.812 --> 12:52.315
One hundred and twenty-three
thousand dollars.

12:53.443 --> 12:57.070
Compliments of Mr. Herod
and Wells Fargo.

12:58.072 --> 12:59.823
All right, gentlemen.

12:59.991 --> 13:02.033
What do you say?

13:02.201 --> 13:04.953
Do we have any real gunmen
in this room?

13:05.121 --> 13:07.497
-That's a matter of opinion.
-Do we?

13:08.374 --> 13:10.208
Yes.

13:14.088 --> 13:15.547
Gutzon.

13:17.425 --> 13:18.717
I'm Swedish champion.

13:19.177 --> 13:22.387
Mr. Gutzon is the first to go up.

13:24.140 --> 13:25.974
Anyone else?

13:26.434 --> 13:29.060
Put an ace up there.
Everyone will know what that means.

13:29.228 --> 13:31.563
-Ace Hanlon.
-Yeah, Ace Hanlon.

13:31.731 --> 13:34.065
You better put me
and my friend Eugene on the list.

13:35.067 --> 13:36.526
You know how to spell your name?

13:36.694 --> 13:39.404
I didn't say nothing
about joining no contest.

13:39.572 --> 13:42.908
Do I hear clucking?
Did somebody bring a chicken in here?

13:43.951 --> 13:47.496
-Settle down, Eugene. Settle down.
-I'll take you now with my bare hands!

13:47.663 --> 13:50.332
No, no, no. You see, it's a gunfight.
We both have guns.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.125
We aim. We fire. You die.

13:52.293 --> 13:53.418
You'll get the idea.

13:53.586 --> 13:57.005
The fighting begins tomorrow
on the street, not in here.

13:57.173 --> 13:59.090
-Put my name up there.
-All right.

13:59.258 --> 14:00.592
Anybody else?

14:00.760 --> 14:03.136
-Sergeant Cantrell.
-How do you spell that?

14:07.683 --> 14:09.184
Correctly.

14:10.978 --> 14:12.103
Anyone else?

14:12.271 --> 14:17.275
Spotted Horse! Many white men
will leave this town in wooden boxes.

14:17.443 --> 14:20.779
Right. Spotted Horse.
Do we have any other fighters?

14:20.947 --> 14:22.697
Put my damn name up.

14:22.865 --> 14:26.034
Scars! S-C-A-R-S.

14:26.452 --> 14:28.286
Gene, you better start practising.

14:28.454 --> 14:31.331
-I'm worth $3000 in four states.
-Anybody else?

14:31.499 --> 14:34.543
Seventy-five offences
and no convictions.

14:35.127 --> 14:37.629
My name's Fee, but...

14:39.131 --> 14:40.799
...everyone calls me the Kid.

14:41.175 --> 14:42.342
Congratulations.

14:46.681 --> 14:49.057
I'm so damn fast,
I can wake up at dawn...

14:49.225 --> 14:51.810
...rob two banks, a train
and a stagecoach...

14:51.978 --> 14:55.647
...shoot the tail feathers off
a duck's ass at 300 feet...

14:56.065 --> 14:59.401
...and still be back in bed
before you wake up next to me.

14:59.569 --> 15:02.320
-How you doing?
-Do we have any more fighters?

15:02.488 --> 15:04.281
-Just fine.
-Yeah.

15:04.448 --> 15:06.700
Virgil Sparks. The pride of Texas.

15:06.867 --> 15:09.077
Virgil Sparks joins the list.

15:09.245 --> 15:12.789
Horace said you drink this.
You sure must wanna die young, miss.

15:15.126 --> 15:18.003
I do now.

15:20.506 --> 15:23.425
We got a lot of spaces here.
Let's fill them up, men.

15:23.593 --> 15:26.303
-I'm gonna put my name up.
-Put my name up there.

15:26.470 --> 15:28.888
Put my name up on this goddamn list.

16:05.926 --> 16:10.138
-How many brave men do we have?
-There are 1 2 right now, Mr. Herod.

16:10.306 --> 16:14.392
Thirteen, if you count Foy,
but he and Ratsy aren't back yet.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.311
They'll be here.

16:16.896 --> 16:18.772
Just running a little errand for me.

16:30.076 --> 16:32.202
-Add my name to the list.
-Attaboy!

16:32.370 --> 16:33.745
Yes, sir.

16:47.218 --> 16:48.885
Get in there!

16:52.765 --> 16:55.767
-We beat the hell out of him.
-Shit, he ain't nothing.

17:00.231 --> 17:01.898
Hello, Cort.

17:02.483 --> 17:06.403
I was beginning to worry you wouldn't
make it in time. It's been a while.

17:07.445 --> 17:10.615
I hear you have a mission
down in Hermosillo.

17:10.782 --> 17:12.492
Is that right?

17:12.952 --> 17:14.786
You own a little piece of heaven?

17:14.954 --> 17:16.829
Sunshine and cactus flowers...

17:16.997 --> 17:21.126
...and you and the orphan children
praying for salvation.

17:21.292 --> 17:24.628
We burned that mission down, sir,
just like you said.

17:25.506 --> 17:27.632
All that work, Cort...

17:28.634 --> 17:31.261
...those years of hard work...

17:31.429 --> 17:33.722
...destroyed for no reason.

17:35.057 --> 17:36.224
It must make you angry.

17:38.185 --> 17:40.311
You used to be fast.

17:42.648 --> 17:44.065
Are you still fast?

17:46.318 --> 17:47.986
Don't l get an answer?

17:49.905 --> 17:52.323
Have you taken a vow of silence?

17:55.369 --> 17:56.870
I said, are you still fast?

17:59.749 --> 18:01.416
Faster than you.

18:06.672 --> 18:08.339
But l have renounced violence.

18:10.718 --> 18:13.094
We'll see.

18:13.262 --> 18:15.889
-String him up.
-Let's get him outside!

18:16.056 --> 18:18.683
No, in here. On the chair.

18:22.730 --> 18:25.356
We're gonna adjust your collar,
Reverend.

18:29.862 --> 18:32.197
Shit, come on. Pull him up, Foy.

18:46.170 --> 18:48.296
Let me make it clear.

18:49.465 --> 18:52.592
-l want you in that contest.
-No.

19:01.811 --> 19:03.728
Think about it.

19:21.831 --> 19:23.581
Last chance.

19:24.416 --> 19:26.668
-Yes or no?
-Go to hell.

19:34.635 --> 19:36.678
Sign me up!

19:37.221 --> 19:39.430
No women in quick draw.
It's against the rules!

19:39.974 --> 19:42.433
There's no rule against ladies.

19:43.269 --> 19:46.104
It's just that women can't shoot
for shit.

19:46.272 --> 19:47.605
That's right.

19:50.484 --> 19:52.277
Adios, Reverend.

20:12.715 --> 20:16.217
-Put them both in the contest.
-Free drinks for all fighters!

20:16.385 --> 20:18.219
Move it, preacher.

20:19.930 --> 20:21.973
Let's chain him up out by the fountain.

20:56.967 --> 20:59.928
-Come back here!
-No!

21:00.095 --> 21:04.015
You come here now!
Do you hear me?

21:04.183 --> 21:07.727
Daddy!

21:21.575 --> 21:23.826
Hey, good morning.

21:23.994 --> 21:26.537
Seems like you definitely had
a good time last night.

21:28.415 --> 21:30.249
Want some breakfast?

21:30.417 --> 21:31.960
-Or how about a little...
-Christ.

21:32.127 --> 21:34.837
...of what we had last night?

21:35.005 --> 21:38.758
Yeah, you certainly won that
drinking contest, that's for sure.

21:39.927 --> 21:42.553
Then again, l sort of won you in poker.

21:42.721 --> 21:44.347
Look.

21:45.349 --> 21:48.059
The last thing l remember
was you puking and passing out...

21:48.227 --> 21:50.812
...behind the saloon,
so let's not plan the wedding yet.

21:50.980 --> 21:52.230
All right, all right.

21:53.023 --> 21:55.775
This thing is so hard.
I don't know how you sleep on it.

21:55.943 --> 21:58.569
If l don't sleep on it,
people will steal it.

22:06.245 --> 22:09.622
-So who you gonna challenge today?
-Herod.

22:11.625 --> 22:13.209
Bad idea. Bad idea.

22:14.128 --> 22:17.922
I'm about the only guy who can take
him, and l ain't gonna rush to do that.

22:18.215 --> 22:19.257
Well, why not?

22:19.925 --> 22:21.426
Well, hell, he's my father.

23:14.980 --> 23:17.398
You been challenged to a fight yet?

23:18.442 --> 23:22.487
You have now.
I'll go get you some time.

23:23.489 --> 23:26.949
These are my boys.
They don't get to church much.

23:27.117 --> 23:29.494
Daddy's gonna kill you, preacher!

23:29.661 --> 23:33.081
-Get him! Get him!
-l hate you!

23:42.883 --> 23:45.843
-Daddy! Daddy!
-Daddy!

23:46.303 --> 23:49.472
-Sleep well?
-Not as well as you.

23:51.850 --> 23:55.019
In case you forgot, preacher,
I saved your life last night.

23:55.187 --> 23:58.481
No. I think you just stretched it out
a bit.

23:58.857 --> 24:00.983
I might have gone to heaven
if you let me die.

24:01.151 --> 24:02.693
Sorry.

24:12.871 --> 24:14.705
Don't you even wanna fight back?

24:15.749 --> 24:17.542
Of course I do.

24:17.709 --> 24:21.671
I'd like to kill them all
for what they've done. But l won't.

24:22.714 --> 24:25.550
Killing people is wrong.

24:25.717 --> 24:27.885
Some people deserve to die.

24:31.098 --> 24:34.934
Mr. Herod, it was
a little lean this week.

24:35.102 --> 24:37.436
And the whisky was tight.

24:38.480 --> 24:42.316
Horace, your excuses
are getting worse every week.

24:42.484 --> 24:48.239
I took everything out of
the register, sir. Everything.

24:48.448 --> 24:50.741
-That's all there was.
-Barkeep.

24:51.743 --> 24:53.411
There you are.

25:16.727 --> 25:17.977
I challenge you.

25:20.814 --> 25:22.899
I'm not fighting you.

25:24.359 --> 25:26.652
-You ain't got no choice.
-l told you!

25:26.820 --> 25:28.821
What are you doing here?

25:30.490 --> 25:32.533
I said, what are you doing here?

25:33.493 --> 25:36.537
-I'm here for the money.
-Then you have to play by the rules.

25:37.289 --> 25:39.707
And the rules say you have to
accept every challenge.

25:39.875 --> 25:43.961
You got a problem with that,
scuttle your butt out of town.

25:44.129 --> 25:45.296
I got no problem.

25:45.464 --> 25:48.132
The lady fights Mr. Kelly.

25:48.300 --> 25:52.220
And they fight at 7:00 tonight.

26:11.406 --> 26:14.283
-Pick a card, honey.
-Thank you.

26:24.836 --> 26:26.045
He's so hot.

26:28.590 --> 26:30.508
Hold it up.

26:39.977 --> 26:42.019
Ace of spades.

26:46.024 --> 26:48.401
Thank you.

26:49.361 --> 26:51.028
That's a neat trick.

26:51.196 --> 26:54.448
I heard you blew a little girl's
thumb off in Reno doing that.

26:56.201 --> 26:57.994
I am the best you'll ever see.

26:58.537 --> 27:00.204
So l keep hearing.

27:01.373 --> 27:03.040
Shall we find out?

27:56.094 --> 27:58.304
Hey, look, girls, there he is.

28:00.932 --> 28:02.141
All right!

28:18.784 --> 28:20.826
It's lights out, Kid!

28:22.079 --> 28:24.580
I'm gonna be pissing
on your grave tonight.

28:24.748 --> 28:26.499
You're through.

28:34.883 --> 28:37.802
Quiet! Quiet!

28:39.805 --> 28:42.014
What's the odds on the Kid?

28:42.557 --> 28:46.227
Gentlemen, please remember...

28:46.395 --> 28:48.979
...you must not draw...

28:49.147 --> 28:52.858
...until that clock
makes the first chime of the hour.

28:53.735 --> 28:57.113
Once that happens,
you may fire at your convenience.

28:57.280 --> 29:00.658
Whoa, now. What if somebody gets
too excited and starts shooting early?

29:00.826 --> 29:01.951
Yeah.

29:02.119 --> 29:06.080
If he cheats,
he'll be eliminated from the contest.

29:11.837 --> 29:14.672
Whoever is standing after the draw...

29:14.840 --> 29:16.340
...is the winner.

29:16.508 --> 29:20.719
If both men are still standing,
you must continue firing.

29:21.972 --> 29:24.140
Do I make myself clear?

29:25.392 --> 29:27.893
Gentlemen, the street is yours.

29:33.733 --> 29:35.734
I'll only wound you, Kid.

29:36.987 --> 29:39.280
You're a kind man.

30:05.974 --> 30:07.641
Damn, am l fast.

30:08.727 --> 30:11.228
Did you even see me,
I was so damn fast?

30:14.733 --> 30:17.151
Hey, there, Mr. Swedish Champion.

30:17.319 --> 30:20.654
Are you done? Stay down, now,
unless you're still fighting.

30:21.531 --> 30:23.616
Yes, l give up.

30:27.621 --> 30:29.914
-Kid's the winner.
-Am I fast?

30:30.081 --> 30:33.125
Or is Sweden just a very small place?
Tell me, now.

30:46.348 --> 30:47.806
Come on, Kid.

30:47.974 --> 30:50.851
I'm gonna get you something to drink.

30:52.270 --> 30:54.647
How does it feel, Cort?

30:55.607 --> 30:58.108
Does it remind you
of the good old days?

31:00.695 --> 31:03.113
Is your heart beating faster?

31:03.281 --> 31:06.116
Is your pulse racing?

31:09.704 --> 31:11.622
-Way to go, Kid!
-Good shooting, Kid!

31:12.123 --> 31:13.916
"Good shooting"?

31:16.044 --> 31:19.255
If the Swede had been any slower,
he'd had birds nesting in his hat.

31:21.466 --> 31:23.467
Come on, Kid.

31:28.014 --> 31:32.476
Spotted Horse cannot be killed
by a bullet.

31:32.644 --> 31:36.480
See? I've taken four bullets
in my arm...

31:36.648 --> 31:39.942
...three in my left leg,
one in my right...

31:40.110 --> 31:41.735
...and two bullets in the back.

31:42.153 --> 31:44.321
Another bullet went through my lip.

31:45.115 --> 31:47.700
Another bullet went through
my left foot.

31:47.867 --> 31:53.664
And another bullet went into my head,
today, here, and did not come out yet.

31:59.838 --> 32:01.589
-No, three.
-How many?

32:01.756 --> 32:05.259
Three. Yes, I ask you three, you
give me one. Come on, give me more.

32:05.468 --> 32:07.261
Okay, okay.

32:07.429 --> 32:10.431
-Now, you're sure you want three?
-Yes.

33:54.077 --> 33:56.078
It's time.

33:56.246 --> 33:57.830
I'm not gonna fight.

34:02.752 --> 34:04.628
You don't wanna fight, huh?

34:04.796 --> 34:06.296
Well, we'll see about that.

34:06.673 --> 34:09.132
Get up! Come on!

34:09.300 --> 34:11.135
Don't keep Mr. Herod waiting.

34:13.679 --> 34:17.056
Come on, preacher, move it. Get up!

34:17.225 --> 34:20.853
-Turn the other cheek, preacher.
-Kick his ass!

34:21.813 --> 34:24.732
He's gonna forgive us.
He's gonna forgive us all.

34:30.321 --> 34:33.532
And that concludes
the lessons for the day.

34:36.995 --> 34:40.289
-My nose!
-I'm shocked.

34:40.873 --> 34:43.000
Reverend here needs a gun.

34:43.168 --> 34:45.668
There's plenty of other places
in town to buy a gun.

34:45.920 --> 34:47.170
Nowhere as cheap.

34:47.338 --> 34:49.965
I wouldn't know a place
that's cheap enough for you.

34:51.134 --> 34:53.802
You know, your mouth
gets faster every day.

34:53.969 --> 34:55.721
Pity your hands are so slow.

34:56.514 --> 34:58.265
I ain't got slow hands.

34:58.433 --> 35:01.393
Sure you do.
Put your hand on the counter here.

35:03.146 --> 35:05.606
Go on. Put your gun hand
up on the counter.

35:10.111 --> 35:12.070
Look at this, Cort.

35:12.238 --> 35:15.783
Here's a gunfighter's hand
and here's a farmer's hand.

35:15.950 --> 35:18.911
I ain't got no farmer's hands.

35:19.704 --> 35:21.371
You know, Cort and me are killers.

35:21.539 --> 35:23.957
We're the genuine article. But you--

35:25.627 --> 35:27.419
You're from different stock.

35:29.380 --> 35:32.007
My friend here needs a gun.

35:39.516 --> 35:42.100
This here's the eagle-butt Peacemaker.

35:42.811 --> 35:44.895
Solid ivory handle. Mexican emblem.

35:45.063 --> 35:47.606
Only 30 of these ever made.

35:49.651 --> 35:55.489
And this is the customized
Remington new model.

35:55.657 --> 35:59.076
Army .44. It's probably more accurate
than your Colt.

35:59.244 --> 36:02.746
I had the wooden handles removed
and replaced with solid silver.

36:03.581 --> 36:05.582
Used with great success...

36:05.750 --> 36:10.212
...on 30-- No, 35 bank robberies
by its late owner.

36:13.091 --> 36:14.174
Boy.

36:15.552 --> 36:18.428
And this-- This is the best help
a man can get.

36:19.222 --> 36:22.766
Smith & Wesson Scofield .45.

36:22.934 --> 36:24.518
Just meat and potatoes.

36:24.686 --> 36:28.105
Me and Jesse James think
it's the best handgun in the world.

36:29.065 --> 36:32.609
I had the trigger guard removed.
It saves drawing time.

36:32.777 --> 36:36.530
Don't ever wear it when you're drunk
or you'll kill your feet.

36:36.865 --> 36:39.408
When's the last time
you held a gun, Cort?

36:40.285 --> 36:42.244
-You know when.
-Yes.

36:42.412 --> 36:46.707
Here. l got offered $120 for this Colt.
You wanna try it out?

36:52.797 --> 36:54.131
You got $1 20, Cort?

36:55.466 --> 36:57.384
I don't have any money.

36:58.803 --> 37:01.388
The Lord provides me
with everything l need.

37:05.518 --> 37:08.353
We're just wasting this boy's time then,
aren't we?

37:08.521 --> 37:10.689
I'll tell you what.
I'll be a good Samaritan.

37:10.857 --> 37:12.900
What's the cheapest gun you got?

37:13.067 --> 37:18.864
Not in the case. The cheapest piece
of worthless crap in the whole store.

37:20.950 --> 37:23.035
All right.

37:26.623 --> 37:29.291
-Five bucks.
-Sold!

37:37.300 --> 37:39.968
What are you doing there? No.

37:40.136 --> 37:43.472
Preacher here's got the Lord on
his side. He only needs one bullet.

37:43.640 --> 37:45.015
Just one.

37:45.183 --> 37:48.185
Otherwise, he might be tempted
to shoot his way out of town.

37:52.148 --> 37:54.983
That gun shoots straight.
I wouldn't sell it if it didn't.

37:55.401 --> 37:56.860
It's okay, Kid. I won't draw.

37:57.028 --> 38:00.072
Sure you will. l know you, Cort.

38:00.239 --> 38:04.034
When it comes down to it,
you'll pull the trigger.

38:06.663 --> 38:08.830
Yeah! Yeah!

38:08.998 --> 38:12.209
I got money on you, preacher!

38:15.713 --> 38:18.715
You're finished. You're finished.
You're finished, you hear me?

38:24.555 --> 38:26.264
I hate you!

38:30.436 --> 38:33.063
Let's see how
you gonna do now, preacher.

38:42.573 --> 38:45.158
I got money on you!

38:57.463 --> 39:00.007
Got 20 bucks on you, boy!

39:01.175 --> 39:03.593
That's money in the bank, Jimmy.

39:04.262 --> 39:06.972
Preacher boy, you're a dead man!

39:53.478 --> 39:55.729
I commit my soul to thee, O Lord.

39:55.897 --> 39:57.647
Forgive me for my sins.

40:24.258 --> 40:26.802
-What the hell--?
-Hey!

40:26.969 --> 40:28.678
He shot me!

40:28.846 --> 40:32.974
-You supposed to lay down and die.
-He shot me!

40:33.518 --> 40:36.186
You said you weren't gonna fight!

40:36.354 --> 40:38.647
-Daddy, are you all right?
-Where are you hit?

40:39.023 --> 40:42.692
Felt natural, didn't it?
Nice and smooth?

40:48.407 --> 40:50.700
Thought you weren't gonna fight, huh?

40:59.502 --> 41:03.839
You're pretty fast.
Hope l don't have to fight you.

41:04.006 --> 41:06.091
You have a choice to be here.
I don't.

41:06.259 --> 41:08.593
He made you do it.

41:08.761 --> 41:11.555
I was the only one
who pulled the trigger.

41:13.724 --> 41:17.227
Well, this ain't much of a town
for a preacher.

41:21.858 --> 41:23.567
I wasn't always a preacher.

41:23.734 --> 41:26.653
Cort was an outlaw, like us.

41:28.573 --> 41:29.990
Weren't you?

41:32.410 --> 41:35.662
In fact, he used to ride with me.

41:38.249 --> 41:40.667
Of course, that's all changed now.

41:41.586 --> 41:43.211
He's a man of peace.

41:44.130 --> 41:45.755
Wouldn't hurt a fly.

41:48.509 --> 41:50.177
Easy.

41:51.470 --> 41:54.931
There was a time
when you couldn't tell us apart.

42:04.984 --> 42:09.696
Is that true? ls that true?

42:10.323 --> 42:11.489
Yes.

42:11.657 --> 42:13.783
I should have let you die.

42:23.211 --> 42:26.296
Go on. It's yours.
Go ahead. Take it.

42:27.173 --> 42:29.633
You smell good.

42:32.678 --> 42:35.472
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

42:37.600 --> 42:40.310
-What are you looking at?
-A dirty old man.

42:40.478 --> 42:44.105
-And a little girl.
-This here is a business discussion.

42:44.273 --> 42:46.942
I'm offering her a job.

42:50.029 --> 42:54.324
Just make sure you wash up
wherever he touches you. Okay?

43:01.832 --> 43:03.416
One of these days...

43:03.584 --> 43:07.128
...l'm gonna have to shoot you up
real good.

43:23.521 --> 43:25.397
Mr. Hanlon...

43:25.564 --> 43:29.025
...l wanted to ask you
about lndian Wells.

43:29.193 --> 43:30.735
Did that fight really take place?

43:32.613 --> 43:35.365
Sure did.

43:35.992 --> 43:38.201
Then it's true that
you gunned down four men?

43:38.869 --> 43:41.955
Two with my left hand,
two with my right hand.

43:42.123 --> 43:44.374
You see, the truth is...

43:44.542 --> 43:47.294
...that l am just as good with either.

43:47.461 --> 43:49.337
You must be the fastest gun
in the West.

43:51.257 --> 43:53.049
That or the biggest liar.

43:55.052 --> 43:57.262
It's a pity you weren't there
to find out.

44:00.224 --> 44:02.559
Oh, but l was, Ace.

44:02.727 --> 44:06.896
You see, I was the one that really
killed the Terrence brothers.

44:07.064 --> 44:11.192
And l doubt a lying little chickenshit
like you was even in the same state.

44:16.407 --> 44:19.075
Goddamn.

44:24.081 --> 44:25.248
God.

44:25.416 --> 44:28.084
How about that left hand, Ace?

44:31.130 --> 44:33.757
How about that left-handed draw?

44:55.446 --> 44:57.489
Mr. Ace Hanlon.

44:57.656 --> 45:00.408
The scourge of the sagebrush.

45:02.745 --> 45:04.954
The terror of Tucson.

45:08.834 --> 45:11.127
A bladder full of hot air.

45:41.534 --> 45:43.910
Congratulations.

45:44.286 --> 45:45.995
Hey, hey, hey.

46:03.514 --> 46:06.182
Get away! Get away. Stay off of him.

46:08.185 --> 46:10.395
Get off him!

46:11.647 --> 46:13.440
Get away!

46:45.306 --> 46:46.598
Daddy!

46:55.608 --> 46:59.068
String him up! Put him on the chair!

47:00.905 --> 47:03.406
Daddy!

47:13.250 --> 47:15.960
They're calling for you on the street.

47:17.296 --> 47:19.714
Are you really gonna do it?

47:20.758 --> 47:22.926
What if you get killed?

47:23.093 --> 47:27.013
Then l won't be around to answer
any more of your dumb questions.

47:27.515 --> 47:30.808
-Hey, miss?
-What?

47:30.976 --> 47:33.144
You can do it.

47:38.609 --> 47:41.027
Lady, come on out!

47:42.196 --> 47:45.281
-Come on out!
-Go on, go on.

47:48.786 --> 47:52.080
There's a click before the strike.
Listen to the clock.

47:52.248 --> 47:53.998
Yeah, lady.

47:55.751 --> 47:57.835
Shut up!

47:58.003 --> 48:01.256
You better win.
I got money on you.

48:02.716 --> 48:05.343
-You shoot, you die.
-Easy, muchacho!

48:19.525 --> 48:21.651
Last fight of the day!

48:23.821 --> 48:27.115
You may fire at the first chime
of the clock.

48:27.283 --> 48:28.825
You're gonna die now, girl.

48:33.080 --> 48:35.164
You're dead meat.

48:36.250 --> 48:39.210
Look at you. You're scared.

48:39.670 --> 48:42.297
You're trembling like a leaf.

48:54.393 --> 48:57.979
There's a click before the strike.
Listen to the clock.

49:46.070 --> 49:48.488
Lady's the winner!

49:50.074 --> 49:52.950
-Damn!
-Hey, come back here.

50:13.806 --> 50:17.725
Quick firing resumes
tomorrow at noon.

50:17.935 --> 50:18.976
I--

50:19.144 --> 50:22.980
-l think you're great.
-Grow up.

50:24.149 --> 50:25.775
Thanks.

51:33.010 --> 51:35.386
Thirsty?

51:35.554 --> 51:37.680
Didn't need to go to
that trouble just for me.

51:37.848 --> 51:39.807
I didn't.

51:39.975 --> 51:41.851
Last night, the Kid.

51:42.770 --> 51:45.688
Tonight, Herod.
You're a busy woman.

51:46.315 --> 51:50.026
-Any man here you're not interested in?
-Yeah. You.

52:14.843 --> 52:17.178
You're looking at me
and you're thinking...

52:17.346 --> 52:20.890
...we have nothing in common,
but we do.

52:21.058 --> 52:23.017
We're both winners.

52:24.436 --> 52:27.730
How do you feel after surviving
your first day?

52:27.898 --> 52:32.068
-Same as yesterday.
-No. Your eyes are shining.

52:33.403 --> 52:37.532
You passed a test. You feel alive.

52:38.116 --> 52:41.244
I guess it doesn't excite me
as much as it does you.

52:47.042 --> 52:49.752
You think I do this contest
because it's fun?

52:49.920 --> 52:51.712
Look at this town.

52:51.880 --> 52:54.715
It's full of people
who'd kill you for your bootlaces.

52:54.925 --> 52:57.927
At least this way,
I get to face my enemies.

52:58.095 --> 53:01.097
They can't sneak up
and shoot me in the back.

53:01.890 --> 53:03.850
And of course, I always win.

53:04.935 --> 53:07.687
Maybe one day your luck will run out.

53:08.272 --> 53:10.690
I don't win because I'm lucky.

53:37.968 --> 53:41.470
-So why'd you come here tonight?
-You invited me.

53:42.598 --> 53:45.391
You could have turned me down.

53:47.269 --> 53:49.395
I wanted to see
what kind of man you are.

53:50.105 --> 53:51.898
What kind of man am I?

53:54.568 --> 53:55.985
The kind people hate.

54:00.824 --> 54:03.159
I'm not trying to be popular.

54:03.327 --> 54:07.330
The people in this town, they need me.

54:07.497 --> 54:11.834
I bring a sense of order to their lives.

54:12.002 --> 54:13.669
Not law, order.

54:13.837 --> 54:16.130
Like hanging a preacher
in the saloon?

54:16.340 --> 54:18.424
He's no preacher.

54:19.259 --> 54:20.927
He's a fraud.

54:22.554 --> 54:26.015
If a man is a killer, then that's
what he is. There's no dishonour.

54:26.183 --> 54:28.517
But don't let that same man
suddenly tell me...

54:28.727 --> 54:30.645
...that it's not in his blood anymore.

54:30.812 --> 54:34.649
-That's worse than a liar.
-Why does he upset you so much?

54:38.946 --> 54:42.365
I find myself almost uncontrollably
attracted to you.

54:43.116 --> 54:44.867
I hope you don't mind
my saying that.

54:49.915 --> 54:52.375
I would think a man like you
would have a woman.

54:55.963 --> 54:59.465
I was married to a beautiful woman.

55:00.634 --> 55:02.593
She was unfaithful.

55:02.761 --> 55:06.347
-Where is she now?
-l told you.

55:06.515 --> 55:08.557
She was unfaithful.

55:15.482 --> 55:17.733
Why are you really here?
You're no gunfighter.

55:17.943 --> 55:19.819
Like l said, for the money.

55:19.987 --> 55:23.489
I could give you more money
than you could ever spend.

55:23.657 --> 55:25.741
I wouldn't feel like I'd earned it.

55:27.244 --> 55:28.953
Oh, yes, you would.

55:38.755 --> 55:40.756
Did you ever kill anyone?

55:41.299 --> 55:42.717
Sure.

55:46.638 --> 55:48.014
I don't think you have.

55:49.266 --> 55:51.934
You see, it all comes down
to one thing:

55:52.269 --> 55:54.103
How far are you prepared to go?

55:55.605 --> 55:57.523
All the way.

56:03.488 --> 56:05.865
My father was a judge.

56:07.909 --> 56:10.953
That surprises you.

56:11.121 --> 56:15.291
He used to make my mother and me
watch people being hanged...

56:15.459 --> 56:17.251
...for our improvement.

56:17.419 --> 56:20.755
One day he said
there was too much bad in this world.

56:21.715 --> 56:24.633
He took a bullet,
put it in his gun...

56:24.801 --> 56:27.178
...spun the chamber...

56:27.345 --> 56:31.307
...and then took it in turns,
clicking it at each of us...

56:31.475 --> 56:34.477
...until he finally blew
the back of his head off...

56:35.979 --> 56:38.773
...with the final click.

56:46.823 --> 56:49.366
Understand this:

56:49.534 --> 56:53.662
There is nothing on this earth
that frightens me now.

56:53.830 --> 56:56.999
-Nothing.
-l have to go.

57:00.962 --> 57:03.672
I shouldn't have come here.

57:05.675 --> 57:07.593
Who are you?

57:08.678 --> 57:10.262
Let me go.

57:45.048 --> 57:48.050
I apologise
for my undignified behaviour...

57:48.218 --> 57:50.761
...but sometimes it's hard
to get a drink around here.

58:01.356 --> 58:03.774
I was only a kid
when l hitched up with Herod.

58:15.620 --> 58:18.664
He singled me out because I was...

58:18.832 --> 58:21.375
...a little smarter,
a little faster than most.

58:25.463 --> 58:30.926
First completely fearless man l met and
he wanted me to be the same as him.

58:35.640 --> 58:38.767
We used to go revenue collecting
along the border, the two of us...

58:38.935 --> 58:40.936
...like some families go on picnics.

58:41.104 --> 58:43.522
We were down in Nogales,
taking the bank...

58:45.275 --> 58:50.613
...and walked out to a street of federal
soldiers and got shot up so bad....

58:53.658 --> 58:56.202
This padre hid us in his mission...

58:57.621 --> 58:59.830
...tended our wounds, fed us...

59:00.457 --> 59:02.791
...talked to us both for hours.

59:04.794 --> 59:07.129
When we were strong enough
to head home...

59:08.506 --> 59:09.965
...Herod told me to shoot him.

59:12.427 --> 59:14.220
When I said no...

59:15.847 --> 59:18.766
...he put a gun to the back of my head...

59:18.934 --> 59:21.560
...and started to count down
from 1 0.

59:29.110 --> 59:31.487
So l killed the priest.

59:33.490 --> 59:37.868
It doesn't matter what l do now.
I'm already damned, I know that.

59:39.621 --> 59:42.623
Don't go down that road.
You don't have to become like me.

59:48.380 --> 59:50.673
Why did you call me up here?

59:51.508 --> 59:54.885
Well, l wanted to ask you
one simple question.

59:55.178 --> 59:58.389
Who brought you here to fight me?

01:00:06.356 --> 01:00:08.232
Mr. Herod.

01:00:09.859 --> 01:00:12.486
I'm just a gentleman adventurer...

01:00:12.696 --> 01:00:15.281
...moseying into town
for the challenge of a gunfight.

01:00:17.534 --> 01:00:19.868
I thought Ace Hanlon
was the hired gun.

01:00:20.036 --> 01:00:21.954
I was so sure of it.

01:00:22.872 --> 01:00:26.458
But he was just a buffoon.
You're not.

01:00:30.213 --> 01:00:34.550
My name is Clay Cantrell,
and I'm a shootist.

01:00:35.927 --> 01:00:37.553
I've killed 1 7 men.

01:00:39.055 --> 01:00:42.391
Killing is purely
a business proposition for me.

01:00:42.559 --> 01:00:43.892
Doesn't give me any pleasure.

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:48.355
My employer's confidential.
Now...

01:00:49.649 --> 01:00:52.568
...do we have business together today?

01:00:53.028 --> 01:00:55.863
As soon as the rain stops,
I'm gonna make an example of you.

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:12.546
So then he said, "Give me the gun."

01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:15.799
So, what could I do?
I gave it to him.

01:01:15.967 --> 01:01:18.093
-Like hell, I did.
-You shot him?

01:01:18.345 --> 01:01:20.512
Yep. That's the story
of Flatnose Freddy...

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:23.098
...who currently resides
six feet under.

01:01:23.266 --> 01:01:24.933
Oh, man.

01:01:26.936 --> 01:01:29.938
It was a big thing for you
to enter the contest.

01:01:30.106 --> 01:01:33.275
You made your point.
Now I want you to step down.

01:01:33.568 --> 01:01:35.861
No disgrace.

01:01:36.237 --> 01:01:39.281
I'll only step down
when you step down.

01:01:39.449 --> 01:01:42.117
I'm telling you to step down.

01:01:42.285 --> 01:01:44.453
Your time will come.

01:01:46.122 --> 01:01:48.374
Not with you still around.

01:01:50.085 --> 01:01:52.711
Don't ever cross me.

01:01:52.962 --> 01:01:56.965
And don't try to stare me down
like you're doing now.

01:01:57.217 --> 01:01:59.385
I'm not sick or old.

01:01:59.552 --> 01:02:01.470
And you're not half the man I am.

01:02:01.638 --> 01:02:03.430
Get out of here.

01:02:12.649 --> 01:02:14.942
Round two!

01:02:15.235 --> 01:02:20.072
Four fights today, featuring
the eight remaining contestants.

01:02:20.657 --> 01:02:24.034
The winner is the contestant
left standing.

01:02:24.577 --> 01:02:26.245
Left alive.

01:02:28.957 --> 01:02:30.999
Left alive!

01:02:32.544 --> 01:02:35.254
From now on, we fight to the death.

01:02:35.463 --> 01:02:38.173
Well, well. What a surprise, John.

01:02:39.342 --> 01:02:41.385
You changing the rules.

01:02:41.594 --> 01:02:43.720
Any problem with that?

01:02:43.888 --> 01:02:45.389
Well...

01:02:46.474 --> 01:02:48.642
...l was planning
to kill you anyway.

01:02:51.855 --> 01:02:55.232
Gentlemen, the street is yours.

01:03:42.238 --> 01:03:44.448
I'm confused.

01:03:45.325 --> 01:03:48.327
All I hear from you,
you spineless cowards...

01:03:48.495 --> 01:03:52.372
...is how poor you are,
how you can't afford my taxes.

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:53.749
My protection.

01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:58.253
And yet somehow, you've all managed
to find the money...

01:03:58.421 --> 01:04:01.048
...to hire a professional gunfighter
to kill me.

01:04:05.887 --> 01:04:08.263
Where's all this money coming from?

01:04:10.767 --> 01:04:12.684
What am I to think?

01:04:15.021 --> 01:04:18.565
If you've got so much to spare, I'm
just gonna have to take more off you.

01:04:18.733 --> 01:04:21.777
Because you clearly
haven't got the message!

01:04:21.945 --> 01:04:23.779
This is my town!

01:04:29.369 --> 01:04:33.664
If you live to see the dawn,
it's because I allow it!

01:04:34.999 --> 01:04:37.084
I'm in charge of everything!

01:04:40.129 --> 01:04:42.464
I decide who lives or who dies!

01:04:53.309 --> 01:04:55.477
Your gunfighter's dead.

01:04:57.564 --> 01:04:59.648
Old news.

01:05:35.602 --> 01:05:38.020
Is it possible?

01:05:38.187 --> 01:05:41.189
Is it possible to improve on perfection?

01:05:41.357 --> 01:05:42.858
The man's dead.

01:05:43.026 --> 01:05:45.986
-Kid's the winner.
-l heard him.

01:05:46.904 --> 01:05:49.031
I heard him move his hand.

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:52.242
I tell you, people.
I'm on a different level.

01:05:52.410 --> 01:05:58.081
In fact, l am the new goddamn mayor
of this town!

01:05:58.249 --> 01:05:59.916
Wonderful!

01:06:01.377 --> 01:06:02.961
He stinks worse dead.

01:06:03.671 --> 01:06:07.716
Storm's coming up. No more fights
till we see what it's gonna do.

01:06:07.884 --> 01:06:10.218
Drinks are on me, fellas.

01:06:15.141 --> 01:06:17.476
We're gonna have to
bury this old man deep.

01:06:17.727 --> 01:06:20.187
He stinks something awful.

01:06:41.626 --> 01:06:43.502
Get up now!

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:49.341
Go on. Get the hell out of here.

01:06:49.509 --> 01:06:52.969
Get the hell out of here. Go.

01:07:11.239 --> 01:07:13.532
Yep.

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:17.285
That little girl is gonna be
a real good earner.

01:07:40.226 --> 01:07:43.645
-Deal me in, boys.
-All right!

01:07:43.813 --> 01:07:45.480
I feel lucky.

01:07:45.648 --> 01:07:47.190
She good?

01:07:49.861 --> 01:07:52.279
Wriggled like a fish.

01:07:56.617 --> 01:07:58.535
Get up!

01:08:05.877 --> 01:08:06.918
Bitch!

01:08:07.170 --> 01:08:10.046
-Bitch, I'll kill you!
-Outside, you bastard!

01:08:10.214 --> 01:08:12.174
-Right now!
-You got it, whore!

01:08:16.345 --> 01:08:19.639
You goddamn Sunday bitch!
I'll blow a hole in you--

01:08:37.366 --> 01:08:39.117
No, please don't kill me! No, no.

01:08:39.285 --> 01:08:41.368
No, please! Don't!

01:08:41.537 --> 01:08:43.747
No, don't kill me! Please!

01:08:45.666 --> 01:08:48.376
John! John!

01:08:48.586 --> 01:08:50.086
-Finish him off!
-No!

01:08:50.254 --> 01:08:53.215
-No, please.
-This contest is not over...

01:08:53.381 --> 01:08:55.300
...until one of you are dead!

01:08:55.468 --> 01:08:57.551
Please, don't kill me! Please!

01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:58.970
No! Please!

01:09:01.557 --> 01:09:04.184
No. No.

01:09:09.398 --> 01:09:12.776
This contest is not over yet!

01:09:22.411 --> 01:09:23.787
Drink.

01:09:26.916 --> 01:09:28.750
Thank you.

01:09:36.466 --> 01:09:37.509
Die!

01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:43.515
-Holy moly!
-Goodness.

01:09:58.197 --> 01:10:02.951
Gold teeth!
A whole mouthful of gold teeth!

01:10:05.454 --> 01:10:07.330
And the lady moves to round three.

01:10:07.498 --> 01:10:11.626
Look at these teeth!
A gold crown!

01:10:13.254 --> 01:10:16.131
There's always forgiveness
if you ask for it.

01:10:40.865 --> 01:10:42.866
Come on, preacher.

01:10:49.332 --> 01:10:51.833
God's on your side, brother!

01:11:06.182 --> 01:11:08.767
-Thank you, Ratsy.
-Goodbye.

01:11:29.497 --> 01:11:32.123
Hey, what are you doing?

01:11:32.375 --> 01:11:34.292
You're not quitting, are you?

01:11:36.253 --> 01:11:40.215
I know this is probably
the wrong time...

01:11:41.384 --> 01:11:46.638
...but l like you, and I want you to stay.

01:11:46.806 --> 01:11:48.723
How can you live like this?

01:11:49.308 --> 01:11:51.226
Live like what?

01:11:51.894 --> 01:11:54.104
Aren't you even gonna stay
for Cort's fight?

01:11:54.271 --> 01:11:55.480
-No, I'm not.
-Wait.

01:11:55.648 --> 01:11:58.233
-It's starting any minute now--
-l don't care about him.

01:11:58.401 --> 01:12:02.821
I don't care about you
or anybody else in this town.

01:12:07.243 --> 01:12:09.035
I'm through.

01:12:16.293 --> 01:12:19.254
I don't think you heard me right.
I said l liked you!

01:12:22.008 --> 01:12:24.134
Last bets!

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:26.136
Place your last bets!

01:12:26.387 --> 01:12:30.515
Spotted Horse cannot be killed
by a bullet.

01:12:30.683 --> 01:12:32.267
Last bets!

01:12:32.852 --> 01:12:34.686
Place your last bets, gentlemen!

01:12:36.147 --> 01:12:40.400
Right now. Place your last bets!

01:13:43.047 --> 01:13:46.174
Man's dead. Cort's the winner.

01:13:46.926 --> 01:13:49.344
He killed that lndian.

01:14:02.775 --> 01:14:03.817
Shit.

01:14:03.984 --> 01:14:08.029
Spotted Horse cannot be killed
by a bullet.

01:14:08.197 --> 01:14:09.614
Give me another bullet.

01:14:09.782 --> 01:14:13.076
I thought I explained the rules to you
very carefully.

01:14:13.244 --> 01:14:15.870
-You have to kill the man.
-Spotted Chief.

01:14:16.497 --> 01:14:19.290
Get on up there. Kill him.

01:14:19.667 --> 01:14:21.042
Give me another bullet, John.

01:14:23.379 --> 01:14:24.671
Somebody give me a bullet!

01:14:27.591 --> 01:14:28.883
Thirty-eight, long Colt.

01:14:31.387 --> 01:14:33.638
"I shall not kill."
That's what you told me.

01:14:35.808 --> 01:14:37.851
"I've renounced all violence."

01:14:38.519 --> 01:14:39.894
Now, goddamn it!

01:14:44.066 --> 01:14:45.525
Now!

01:15:25.107 --> 01:15:26.774
Congratulations.

01:15:26.942 --> 01:15:29.944
Looks like you're going
to the next round, preacher.

01:15:32.948 --> 01:15:34.699
Applause him.

01:15:46.045 --> 01:15:47.879
Bravo.

01:15:49.548 --> 01:15:53.468
Welcome back, killer.

01:16:05.147 --> 01:16:06.564
Give me that.

01:16:39.098 --> 01:16:40.974
I knew I'd find you here.

01:16:42.017 --> 01:16:43.726
You know who l am?

01:16:43.894 --> 01:16:47.689
Of course I do.
I brought you into this world.

01:16:55.197 --> 01:16:58.408
-Your father was--
-l don't wanna talk about it.

01:16:58.575 --> 01:17:02.328
You've been here for hours
looking for his grave.

01:17:02.663 --> 01:17:03.871
He's not here.

01:17:05.291 --> 01:17:06.541
Herod's men...

01:17:06.917 --> 01:17:09.294
...they smashed the gravestone
I made...

01:17:10.921 --> 01:17:14.799
...and then they burned his body
till there was nothing left.

01:17:16.552 --> 01:17:19.053
There are good people here.

01:17:19.221 --> 01:17:22.682
They're just cowards, like me.

01:17:23.892 --> 01:17:26.269
And they're waiting, hoping...

01:17:26.437 --> 01:17:29.897
...someone like you
will come and stop him.

01:17:30.065 --> 01:17:32.650
I can't.

01:17:32.818 --> 01:17:34.944
I can't kill him!

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:39.824
I had my chance and l was scared.

01:17:41.076 --> 01:17:43.911
I'm scared of dying.

01:17:44.079 --> 01:17:47.206
You've been dead since it happened.

01:17:49.001 --> 01:17:51.377
You're more scared of living.

01:17:52.713 --> 01:17:56.090
It would be the same
if you keep riding.

01:18:00.971 --> 01:18:03.723
I pulled this from the fire.

01:18:04.016 --> 01:18:06.100
He was the best friend
I ever had.

01:18:10.105 --> 01:18:12.815
String him up! Put him on a chair!

01:18:16.195 --> 01:18:18.363
-Just say your prayers.
-Here's the rope!

01:18:43.806 --> 01:18:46.140
Daddy, no!

01:18:46.308 --> 01:18:47.642
Wait, gal!

01:18:49.019 --> 01:18:50.728
Put her down, goddamn it!

01:18:50.896 --> 01:18:52.480
Let her go!

01:19:11.333 --> 01:19:13.292
Hey, little darling.

01:19:15.671 --> 01:19:18.339
Hello, bonita. Hey, hey!

01:19:18.507 --> 01:19:21.092
What's wrong with you?

01:19:37.276 --> 01:19:39.986
--pay for that. Oh, boy.
And you gonna take him.

01:19:43.699 --> 01:19:45.533
What the heck--?

01:19:46.201 --> 01:19:50.037
What the hell ails you?
That's Mr. Herod's prisoner, lady.

01:19:50.247 --> 01:19:52.957
-You ain't going nowhere.
-l hope you don't feel...

01:19:53.125 --> 01:19:57.837
...l've sunk to some base, primal level
of humanity. You see, now...

01:19:58.005 --> 01:20:01.549
...the Bible speaks of turning
plough shears into swords, see...

01:20:01.717 --> 01:20:03.634
...when faced with
an insurmountable evil.

01:20:03.802 --> 01:20:07.221
And l feel that it must be God's will
that I'm here.

01:20:07.890 --> 01:20:12.477
So, l.... I....

01:20:14.438 --> 01:20:16.355
And l....

01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:26.782
Oh, God.

01:20:31.788 --> 01:20:35.082
-Why are you doing this to me?
-Because...

01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:38.044
...we could both be dead tomorrow.

01:21:32.432 --> 01:21:35.142
Promise me--
Promise me you'll leave Herod for me.

01:21:58.125 --> 01:22:00.710
-l challenge you.
-Go away.

01:22:01.044 --> 01:22:02.837
I'm not fighting anybody else.

01:22:03.005 --> 01:22:04.338
I want you.

01:22:07.134 --> 01:22:09.427
I've already been challenged.

01:22:14.516 --> 01:22:16.851
It's time for me to see
if I'm my father's equal.

01:22:23.692 --> 01:22:26.485
You would fight your own son.

01:22:27.237 --> 01:22:30.781
I'm gonna kill you if l have to ride
all the way to hell to do it.

01:22:30.949 --> 01:22:32.992
Do you have some particular problem
with me?

01:22:36.622 --> 01:22:37.955
I'll let you know.

01:22:58.852 --> 01:23:03.397
I'm not fighting you.

01:23:03.565 --> 01:23:07.568
I came here to kill Herod,
and that's what I'm gonna do.

01:23:07.736 --> 01:23:10.988
-Stand down.
-l will not stand down.

01:23:11.156 --> 01:23:14.075
Stand down. Let me take him
in the final. He'll be just as dead.

01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:22.500
Let me make something clear
to both of you: You are gonna fight.

01:23:23.210 --> 01:23:26.504
Nobody walks out on this contest.
Nobody stands down.

01:23:27.839 --> 01:23:30.341
You don't tell me what to do.

01:23:31.843 --> 01:23:34.428
You try to leave town,
my men will kill you.

01:23:34.638 --> 01:23:37.098
You refuse to fight,
my men will kill you.

01:23:37.265 --> 01:23:41.018
You had your chance to quit.
Now it's gone.

01:23:59.746 --> 01:24:02.206
Clear the street!

01:24:02.666 --> 01:24:05.167
Round three!

01:24:05.335 --> 01:24:08.713
Only four contestants left.

01:24:08.922 --> 01:24:12.341
Mr. Herod fights the Kid.

01:24:12.509 --> 01:24:15.302
Then the lady fights Cort.

01:24:15.637 --> 01:24:17.388
Clear the streets!

01:24:17.556 --> 01:24:19.765
You don't have to do this.

01:24:20.142 --> 01:24:22.560
Everybody already knows
you're the best.

01:24:22.728 --> 01:24:24.979
No. It ain't about that.

01:24:25.689 --> 01:24:27.356
I'm his son.

01:24:27.816 --> 01:24:30.901
And if this is the only way
he's gonna admit that...

01:24:34.573 --> 01:24:36.407
...then so be it.

01:24:38.118 --> 01:24:40.327
What can you possibly get out of this?

01:24:40.996 --> 01:24:43.247
What do you want?

01:24:51.548 --> 01:24:54.341
All I want is his respect.

01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:37.551
-Come on! You can do it!
-We love you!

01:25:42.474 --> 01:25:44.725
I love you.

01:25:49.815 --> 01:25:51.148
We're with you!

01:25:53.568 --> 01:25:56.153
That boy's gonna dust you!

01:25:57.113 --> 01:25:59.657
Yeah, come on, Kid.

01:26:01.243 --> 01:26:03.911
Drop out. You've made your point.

01:26:05.872 --> 01:26:08.749
The gunfight is in the head...

01:26:08.917 --> 01:26:11.252
...not in the hands.

01:26:13.296 --> 01:26:16.799
The only thing
that makes him invincible...

01:26:16.967 --> 01:26:19.343
...is because you all think he is.

01:26:20.887 --> 01:26:23.889
Maybe five years ago
he was the fastest...

01:26:26.518 --> 01:26:29.270
...but time catches up with everyone.

01:26:30.605 --> 01:26:33.774
He's just a little bit slower
than he used to be.

01:26:34.192 --> 01:26:36.861
And as for myself,
would you believe it?

01:26:41.950 --> 01:26:43.534
I just reached my peak.

01:27:03.930 --> 01:27:06.640
Shit, that was fast.

01:27:08.101 --> 01:27:10.811
No! No!

01:27:10.979 --> 01:27:13.772
Oh, my-- Oh, my God!

01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:15.524
Oh, my God!

01:27:39.090 --> 01:27:40.758
Did I get him?

01:27:41.927 --> 01:27:43.844
Yeah, Kid. You got him.

01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:46.096
Did I kill him?

01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:49.892
You were so fast, Kid.

01:27:50.101 --> 01:27:52.603
Please! I don't wanna die.

01:27:54.397 --> 01:27:57.399
I don't wanna die!

01:28:04.491 --> 01:28:06.408
I know.

01:28:33.103 --> 01:28:35.771
It was never proved
that he was my son.

01:28:38.233 --> 01:28:42.528
It was a farmer that was....
He wasn't mine.

01:28:48.994 --> 01:28:50.828
I gave him a way out.

01:28:50.996 --> 01:28:52.746
He wouldn't take it.

01:29:58.104 --> 01:30:01.482
-What kind of ink do you have?
-Any kind you need.

01:31:37.245 --> 01:31:42.082
If neither one of you fire
by the time l count down from 1 0...

01:31:42.584 --> 01:31:44.543
...my men will gun you down.

01:31:53.136 --> 01:31:54.970
Ten.

01:31:56.347 --> 01:31:58.265
-Nine.
-Draw your gun.

01:31:58.433 --> 01:32:01.185
-There's no point in both of us dying.
-Eight.

01:32:03.438 --> 01:32:05.272
-Seven.
-Draw, goddamn it!

01:32:05.899 --> 01:32:07.232
Six.

01:32:07.442 --> 01:32:09.109
Kill me, Ellen!

01:32:09.569 --> 01:32:11.069
-Five.
-Kill me!

01:32:11.529 --> 01:32:12.988
Four.

01:32:13.156 --> 01:32:14.948
-Kill me!
-Three.

01:32:15.116 --> 01:32:16.575
Kill me, or I'm gonna kill you!

01:32:16.826 --> 01:32:18.535
-Two.
-Please.

01:32:19.579 --> 01:32:20.954
One!

01:32:47.982 --> 01:32:50.192
She's dead.

01:32:50.693 --> 01:32:54.071
Oh, Jesus. She's dead.

01:32:54.239 --> 01:32:58.116
Leave her alone, you vultures!
Don't touch her!

01:32:59.035 --> 01:33:02.454
Nice shooting, Reverend.
Like l always say...

01:33:02.622 --> 01:33:07.125
...you put a fox in the henhouse, you'll
have chicken for dinner every time.

01:33:07.877 --> 01:33:10.170
You're gonna burn for this,
you son of a bitch.

01:33:10.672 --> 01:33:12.172
This what you wanted all along?

01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:14.091
Why don't you come and get some?

01:33:15.802 --> 01:33:17.010
My nose!

01:33:21.724 --> 01:33:23.642
Son of a bitch!

01:33:28.773 --> 01:33:31.942
Of course we'll fight.
But the rules say tomorrow.

01:33:32.527 --> 01:33:36.613
-I'll even let you name the time.
-Dawn.

01:33:51.212 --> 01:33:53.672
Break my nose twice.

01:33:56.759 --> 01:33:59.344
Now we'll see how fast you can draw.

01:34:14.902 --> 01:34:18.572
Into the valley of death....

01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:20.741
I fear no evil.

01:35:14.462 --> 01:35:17.798
-Who did that?
-l did that, Mr. Herod.

01:35:17.965 --> 01:35:21.885
Ratsy, you ruined the contest.
You got 20 seconds to get out of town.

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:26.306
Wait, that's not fair. l only ever done
what you told me to, Mr. Herod.

01:35:26.474 --> 01:35:28.475
Ratsy, you now have 1 5 seconds.

01:35:28.643 --> 01:35:30.685
Goodbye, Ratsy.

01:35:31.479 --> 01:35:34.731
-Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
-What do you think, Cort?

01:35:36.150 --> 01:35:39.319
There's a lot of people here
that want entertainment.

01:35:39.487 --> 01:35:41.822
I could draw with my left hand.

01:35:41.989 --> 01:35:43.740
How does that sound?

01:35:45.576 --> 01:35:49.287
Of course, unlike Mr. Ace Hanlon,
I really can fight with both hands.

01:35:49.997 --> 01:35:52.833
How do you feel? I'm nervous.

01:35:53.584 --> 01:35:57.504
It takes a lot to scare me.
I love the sensation.

01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:04.594
Time's up, Ratsy!

01:36:11.477 --> 01:36:13.478
I always wanted to fight you, Cort.

01:36:14.230 --> 01:36:16.356
Ever since the first time l saw you.

01:36:17.984 --> 01:36:21.111
It's just this itch
that I had to scratch.

01:36:36.878 --> 01:36:39.504
Whatever happens,
if he's still standing in the end...

01:36:39.672 --> 01:36:41.381
...gun him down.

01:37:35.061 --> 01:37:37.270
-Oh, my God!
-Shit!

01:38:51.053 --> 01:38:52.679
You're dead.

01:38:52.847 --> 01:38:54.264
You're dead!

01:39:24.879 --> 01:39:26.504
Sorry, John.

01:39:26.672 --> 01:39:30.550
Changed the rules.
From now on, all the fights are fair.

01:39:32.345 --> 01:39:33.887
Who are you?

01:39:50.988 --> 01:39:53.406
You stole my life.

01:39:54.367 --> 01:39:58.161
Let her go, you son of a bitch!
Let her go!

01:40:02.583 --> 01:40:07.587
Wait a minute. Please, don't make
my little girl watch this. Please.

01:40:07.755 --> 01:40:09.756
Let her go before you kill me.

01:40:09.924 --> 01:40:11.549
Oh, l can't do that.

01:40:11.717 --> 01:40:14.010
Tell you what.
I've had my three shots.

01:40:14.178 --> 01:40:16.596
I'll give you three shots
to save your daddy's life.

01:40:16.764 --> 01:40:19.099
You filthy son of a bitch.

01:40:19.850 --> 01:40:21.267
Shoot the rope...

01:40:21.435 --> 01:40:23.937
...and if it breaks,
your daddy can live.

01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:25.855
You got my word.

01:40:28.651 --> 01:40:30.026
You can do it, darling.

01:40:33.447 --> 01:40:34.864
I can't.

01:40:35.324 --> 01:40:38.118
You can do it, darling. Come on.

01:40:38.285 --> 01:40:40.829
Just hold the gun in both hands.

01:40:41.539 --> 01:40:43.123
Pull the hammer back.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.290
-l can't.
-You can.

01:40:47.210 --> 01:40:50.590
-You can do it.
-No, I can't!

01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:53.675
Don't you worry about this.

01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:56.050
None of this is your fault.

01:40:57.305 --> 01:40:59.180
Don't you blame yourself, now.

01:40:59.350 --> 01:41:02.975
Just remember...

01:41:03.225 --> 01:41:05.560
...that your daddy loves you.

01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:08.815
I'll always love you. Now...

01:41:10.110 --> 01:41:12.570
...just remember that. Now, come on.

01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:17.910
Come on.

01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:28.500
That's close enough.

01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:03.620
You're not fast enough for me!

01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:06.205
Today l am.

01:43:28.580 --> 01:43:31.205
The law has come back to town.
