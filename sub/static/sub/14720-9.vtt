CAROL: I just need to collecta sample without him knowing,

00:08.240 --> 00:09.720
and then take that to be tested.

00:09.840 --> 00:11.400
PHINEAS: We should
do a quick cash job.

00:11.520 --> 00:12.160
TED WEST: No.
We wait.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.080
[gunshot]

00:13.200 --> 00:14.320
Fuck!

00:14.440 --> 00:15.960
MAN 1: We have the
suspect in custody.

00:16.080 --> 00:17.600
WOLF WEST: So we find whereeverything is and we steal it.

00:17.720 --> 00:18.600
WENDY: There are cars.

00:18.720 --> 00:21.040
They work differently, via safe.

00:21.160 --> 00:24.400
Evan has a pile of these bearerbonds with many suitcases

00:24.520 --> 00:25.720

WOLF WEST: Pinning it
on the girlfriend--

00:26.880 --> 00:28.040
I'm not sure it's the way to go.

00:28.160 --> 00:29.360
RITA WEST: You are
not letting your dick

00:29.480 --> 00:30.680
get in the way of a job.
- Jesus Christ, mom!

00:30.800 --> 00:32.080
RITA WEST: Listen to me.
It is her or you.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.800
WOLF WEST: I'm going
up north for a bit.

00:33.920 --> 00:34.960
You need to be somewhere else.

00:35.080 --> 00:35.840
Like where?

00:35.960 --> 00:39.160
Nowhere near this place.

00:39.280 --> 00:41.120
[squeaking]

00:44.520 --> 00:47.120
Carol was telling me
that in America, you

00:47.240 --> 00:50.000
can hire classic cars--

00:50.120 --> 00:52.920
Thunderbirds and Mustangs.

00:53.040 --> 00:54.640
Oh yeah?

00:54.760 --> 00:58.000
You and me driving
up the California coast

00:58.120 --> 01:00.640
to San Francisco.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.880
Let's not get
ahead of ourself, eh?

01:03.000 --> 01:06.480
It's all clockwork from
here on in, depending

01:06.600 --> 01:10.440
on the dodgy guy we hadto get in to do the safe.

01:10.560 --> 01:11.840
Yeah.

01:11.960 --> 01:12.960
Just out of interest,
how were you planning

01:13.080 --> 01:15.480
on doing the safe without me?

01:15.600 --> 01:18.640
Would have got it openeventually, by hitting it,

01:18.760 --> 01:19.920
mainly.

01:20.040 --> 01:21.360
TED WEST: Yeah, I'm
sure you would have.

01:24.280 --> 01:25.560
Sea shoal.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.200
Once more for luck.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.080
[kissing sounds]

01:32.040 --> 01:35.080
When you've got
that safe open,

01:35.200 --> 01:37.720
you can do me anywhere you like.

01:37.840 --> 01:43.600
Then I choose
you naked in my lap

01:43.720 --> 01:48.240
as we drive across the desertto Vegas in a soft top Cadillac.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.480
Well, I'm fucking
game if you are.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.200
Soldier guys?

01:54.320 --> 01:55.760
Yep.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.800
And needs the game to thenext something that you ask?

01:58.920 --> 02:00.320
You got everything you need?

02:00.440 --> 02:04.440
Thunderbirds, I got,
like I said last night.

02:04.560 --> 02:06.400
You know, you can get speciallittle grapefruit knives,

02:06.520 --> 02:07.840
right?

02:07.960 --> 02:10.440
ERIC: My grandma's got onethat's got a big blade.

02:10.560 --> 02:11.880
Is that so?

02:12.000 --> 02:13.520
Maybe we'll worry
about grapefruit knives

02:13.640 --> 02:14.480
after the job.

02:14.600 --> 02:17.480
That's a good idea.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.120
TED WEST: Oy.

02:19.240 --> 02:22.120
[inaudible] Not
even a good luck?

02:22.240 --> 02:23.800
Mom says she doesn't
believe in good luck.

02:23.920 --> 02:24.840
Only good planning.

02:24.960 --> 02:26.280
Well, that's not the point.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.040
It's just bloody good manners.

02:28.160 --> 02:29.880
Fine.

02:30.000 --> 02:30.800
Good luck.

02:30.920 --> 02:31.720
Thank you.

02:31.840 --> 02:33.000
Good luck to you, too.

When you're walking
down the alley, yes.

02:42.760 --> 02:43.640
Watch your back.

02:43.760 --> 02:44.920
Watch your back.

02:45.040 --> 02:48.080
When you're out on
the street and there's

02:48.200 --> 02:50.040
a danger on the
street these days.

02:50.160 --> 02:52.960
You can't see it through
the fog and haze.

RITA WEST: Do I get
three guesses why you're

03:08.520 --> 03:11.920
behaving like a prize pillock?

03:12.040 --> 03:14.440
Is it because I brought
dad in on the job?

03:14.560 --> 03:15.800
I don't give a
shit about that.

03:15.920 --> 03:17.960
Is it because you don't
get to be part of today?

03:18.080 --> 03:18.920
I am part of today.

03:19.040 --> 03:20.720
I'm the guy who set all this up.

03:20.840 --> 03:22.240
RITA WEST: Exactly, Which?

03:22.360 --> 03:24.280
Is why you have to be faraway when it all happens.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.720
Evan's still
going to suspect me.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.520
RITA WEST: Yeah, but hewon't be able to prove it.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.800
The rest is you being able
to look him in the eye

03:30.920 --> 03:32.520
and deny everything.

03:32.640 --> 03:34.680
Can you do that, Wolf?
- Yeah, sure.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.200
RITA WEST: Because
I don't want to have

03:36.320 --> 03:39.120
to go to my third guess,which is that you've gone soft

03:39.240 --> 03:40.760
on this job, whether
that's because you

03:40.880 --> 03:43.160
like being mates with him orshe is leading you by your dick.

03:43.280 --> 03:44.400
Nobody's leading
anybody anywhere.

maggots, Wolf.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.480

04:27.440 --> 04:28.640
I am a very good
tennis player,

04:28.760 --> 04:31.840
so I don't see me losing
in the early rounds.

04:31.960 --> 04:35.920
But if you do, we shouldmake a day of it, you know?

04:36.040 --> 04:37.680
Yeah.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.600
I'm getting the idea.

You know the tennis girl withthe dress and she's looking

04:52.200 --> 04:53.440

04:53.560 --> 04:54.560
Yeah, I know the one
you're talking about.

04:54.680 --> 04:56.280

nothing about art?

But a classic's
a classic, right?

04:59.360 --> 05:01.960

05:06.960 --> 05:08.120
South Africans--
they love the shore.

05:08.240 --> 05:09.520
I have no idea why.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.120
So drive up north.

05:11.240 --> 05:12.880
They know where they're goingand what they need to do.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.560
There's a score within theboat, so getting them there

05:15.680 --> 05:17.360

What about this one?

06:17.440 --> 06:19.640
Is he even tall enough tosee over the steering wheel?

06:19.760 --> 06:20.720
He can see enough.

06:20.840 --> 06:21.920
That's Sione.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.800
He's our finest,
best driver, I swear.

06:23.920 --> 06:26.400
He used to drive
a taxi in Savai'i.

bring the van back.

You are in safe hands.

has spread far and wide,

06:37.240 --> 06:39.920
and we will be proud to beof most excellent service.

We will treat this job
with humility and honor.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.040

06:44.160 --> 06:45.080
We won't screw up.

I've got the number.

I'm not thrilled that you'rehere because I don't know you.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.640

trust those grunts.

for you, then OK.

I can help with?

Fructose and semen.

08:22.680 --> 08:24.720
Liquefaction of the ejaculate.

08:24.840 --> 08:25.880
I'm sorry, love.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.560
This medical stuff's
all Greek to me.

08:27.680 --> 08:30.080
What's wrong with you?
- It's not me.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.600
It's Phineas.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.400
He can't make babies.

08:33.520 --> 08:35.120
His balls are infertile.

08:35.240 --> 08:36.840
Oh.

08:36.960 --> 08:38.880
Maybe you should be talkingto Phineas about this.

08:39.000 --> 08:39.960
He doesn't know.

08:40.080 --> 08:42.200
TED WEST: Know what?

08:42.320 --> 08:43.760
That he's taken the test.

08:43.880 --> 08:45.040
How can he not know?

08:45.160 --> 08:49.400
They had to test his
stuff, didn't they?

08:49.520 --> 08:50.720
I milked him.

08:53.720 --> 08:55.160
I'm sorry?

08:55.280 --> 09:00.880
He was drunk, passed out,and I milked him like a cow

09:01.000 --> 09:01.800
for his stuff.

09:04.760 --> 09:07.280
I think we both
need a cup of tea.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.800
So we all wait here.

09:08.920 --> 09:11.240
RITA WEST: Rod, I just explainedwhat we're going to do.

09:11.360 --> 09:12.520
What if I came with you?

09:12.640 --> 09:14.160
- Why?
- To help.

09:14.280 --> 09:15.720
To get in there before
the others, you mean.

09:15.840 --> 09:16.600
Oh, it could save time.

09:16.720 --> 09:17.960
Rod, you wait here.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.400
That is the plan.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.120
Sparky, everything
good with you?

09:21.240 --> 09:22.280
Yep.

09:22.400 --> 09:23.240
Good.

09:23.360 --> 09:24.240
Nervous, but in a good way.

09:24.360 --> 09:25.120
Excited.

09:25.240 --> 09:26.840
Bits of me are tingling.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.040
Good to know.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.520
Eric, time to light up!
ERIC: OK, boys.

09:29.640 --> 09:30.840
You heard the lady.

09:30.960 --> 09:32.720
Time to get this
show on the road.

09:40.120 --> 09:41.960
[truck running]

09:49.400 --> 09:51.720
This is Wolf's map of
the evil Spiller farm.

09:51.840 --> 09:55.040
It tells us-- it's not to scale.

09:55.160 --> 09:57.560
I think-- it's not
to anything, really.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.120
Wolf is a bit shit whenit comes to drawing maps.

10:00.240 --> 10:01.320
So where do they
keep the car keys?

10:01.440 --> 10:04.840
WOLF WEST: In Spiller's
office in a box.

10:04.960 --> 10:07.040
What sort of box.

10:07.160 --> 10:08.000
Biscuit tin.

10:08.120 --> 10:10.040
FALANI: This is our destination.

10:10.160 --> 10:11.680
So move out, my team.

10:11.800 --> 10:15.120
And remember, our
silence is our kung fu,

10:15.240 --> 10:17.760
and our kung fu is very strong.

10:17.880 --> 10:21.040
Also, if you mess this up, Mrs.Rita will give you a hiding

10:21.160 --> 10:22.600
of 1,000 [inaudible] coats.

10:22.720 --> 10:23.480
Advance.

10:29.040 --> 10:30.920
Team, a hand for your leader.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.440
We should go out tonight.

10:35.560 --> 10:36.320
Yeah.

10:36.440 --> 10:38.160
Melba?

10:38.280 --> 10:40.400
So you can do coke
with the models again?

10:40.520 --> 10:42.720
That was one time.

10:42.840 --> 10:43.680
Two times.
Yes, OK.

10:43.800 --> 10:44.560
Sorry, I forgot.

10:44.680 --> 10:46.040
We'll see.

10:46.160 --> 10:47.320
I might be too
tired after kicking

10:47.440 --> 10:48.600
ass on the tennis court.

10:48.720 --> 10:51.560
Yeah, but that's
why God gave us coke.

10:51.680 --> 10:52.440
We'll see.

10:57.360 --> 10:58.760
WENDY: And if you can
give the gold digging

10:58.880 --> 11:00.800
bitch a slap while you'reat it, that would be good.

11:00.920 --> 11:03.800
RITA WEST: But if I
have to prioritize--

11:03.920 --> 11:05.520
the money or the slap?

11:05.640 --> 11:08.000
The money, definitely.

11:08.120 --> 11:09.200
But the slap if you can manage.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.480
ERIC: What if he doesn't leave?

11:18.600 --> 11:19.360
He will.

11:22.200 --> 11:23.360
Go on.

11:23.480 --> 11:24.360
Right you are.

11:30.920 --> 11:32.120
What are you doing, Eric?

11:32.240 --> 11:35.240
Blending in with
the surroundings.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.280
I'm a jogger.

11:37.400 --> 11:38.280
If you say so.

11:46.280 --> 11:50.200
You can't ever really be awoman until you've had a child.

11:50.320 --> 11:53.600
I've watched Rita andNgaire and all my friends.

11:53.720 --> 11:57.440
I've seen them buyingbooties and nursing bras,

11:57.560 --> 12:01.040
and here I am on thesideline, watching and never

12:01.160 --> 12:04.400
getting a chance to get
called up, all the time

12:04.520 --> 12:05.840
thinking it's me.

12:05.960 --> 12:08.240
Thinking there's
something wrong with me.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.200
[knocking]

12:13.760 --> 12:14.720
Ngaire, great to see you.

12:14.840 --> 12:16.240
Rita here?

12:16.360 --> 12:17.440
I was just down at theGalleria, and it's all shut up.

12:17.560 --> 12:18.600
I'm supposed to
be working today.

12:18.720 --> 12:20.240
No, she's off up north.

12:20.360 --> 12:21.760
You said she'd
gone down south.

12:21.880 --> 12:23.160
Well, whit, Carol.
I don't know.

12:23.280 --> 12:24.880
How often do I listen
to what Rita says?

12:25.000 --> 12:26.680
My God, Carol.

12:26.800 --> 12:28.160
Are you all right?

12:28.280 --> 12:29.760
No, I'm not.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.920
That bastard didn't takeanother swing at you, did he?

12:32.040 --> 12:32.800
No, he would never.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.960
Not anymore.

12:35.080 --> 12:37.160
But it's worse than that.

12:37.280 --> 12:38.840
He can't give me babies.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.040
NGAIRE MUNROE: Oh, the
result's come back?

12:41.160 --> 12:42.120
CAROL: Yes.

12:42.240 --> 12:43.240
He's infertile.

12:43.360 --> 12:44.880
NGAIRE MUNROE: Oh,
you poor thing.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.320
CAROL: All those sperms, andnone of them can swim properly.

12:46.440 --> 12:48.160
TED WEST: Right, I'll
leave you ladies to it.

12:48.280 --> 12:49.520
Does he know?

12:49.640 --> 12:51.120
He still doesn't even
know he's been tested.

12:51.240 --> 12:52.400
Well then, there's
nothing for it.

12:52.520 --> 12:53.720
You have to tell him
he's firing blanks.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.120
Uh, no.

12:55.240 --> 12:56.120
No, no, no, no.

12:56.240 --> 12:57.800
That's a very, very bad idea.

12:57.920 --> 12:59.320
NGAIRE MUNROE: So it's all rightfor him to go around thinking

12:59.440 --> 13:00.520
it's Carol's fault?

13:00.640 --> 13:01.640
TED WEST: No offense,
but he is not

13:01.760 --> 13:03.120
going to take this news well.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.120
Trust me.

13:04.240 --> 13:05.360
I'm speaking from experience.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.720
I'm not shooting blanks!

13:11.120 --> 13:14.440
All I asked was if
you've been tested.

13:14.560 --> 13:15.880
[yelling]

13:17.000 --> 13:18.760
You might have a point there.

13:18.880 --> 13:20.200
Maybe we need a plan B.

13:20.320 --> 13:23.120
Ted, be a doll and
put the kettle on.

13:23.240 --> 13:25.080
[sighing]

13:35.160 --> 13:36.680
Nah, it's out of order.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.160
It was all right
half an hour ago.

13:38.280 --> 13:41.200
Well, it's not now.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.520
It's spelled wrong.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.040
Is it?

13:45.160 --> 13:46.640
Well it doesn't bloodychange the fact that it's

13:46.760 --> 13:48.480
not working now, does it?

13:48.600 --> 13:50.080
And if you have any
spelling problems,

13:50.200 --> 13:51.480
take them up with the
post office, not me.

13:51.600 --> 13:52.680
I won't take them up with you.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.000
Well, it sounded
to me like you were.

13:54.120 --> 13:55.080
I was just saying.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.800
Out of order.

13:56.920 --> 13:57.680
Got it?

14:00.440 --> 14:01.640
The toys are in there.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.360
That is where the demon,
Spiller, looks alone

14:03.480 --> 14:04.360
with the price that we seek.

14:11.440 --> 14:14.280
Sebussi, you come with me.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.520
[snoring]

14:32.640 --> 14:35.000
Oh shit.

14:35.120 --> 14:36.920
[snoring]

14:40.000 --> 14:41.320
What sort of biscuits?

14:41.440 --> 14:42.920
I don't know.

14:43.040 --> 14:45.840
One of those Griffin oneswith all the different sorts.

14:45.960 --> 14:46.760
Good to know.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.880
[groan]

15:17.360 --> 15:19.400
Let the frigate birds fly.

15:19.520 --> 15:22.680
But don't let them forgetto take me with them.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.640
[keys jingling]

15:26.680 --> 15:28.520
[cars running]

15:35.440 --> 15:38.200
Remember, none of this
will work unless you

15:38.320 --> 15:39.920
get Spiller to sound the alarm.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.920
[knocking]

15:45.040 --> 15:46.560
Seriously, Falani.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.720
If Spiller doesn't get on thephone to Evan, none of this

15:48.840 --> 15:49.600
will work.

15:55.160 --> 15:57.040
[groan]

16:05.040 --> 16:05.920
What the fuck?

16:10.080 --> 16:10.960
Hey!

16:11.080 --> 16:14.800
Come back, you brown bastards!

16:14.920 --> 16:16.400
[groaning]

16:17.440 --> 16:20.360
Why are you still here?

16:20.480 --> 16:21.760
I need to use the phone.

16:21.880 --> 16:22.960
It's out of order.

16:23.080 --> 16:23.880
Why are you still here?

16:24.000 --> 16:25.200
[phone ringing]

16:26.200 --> 16:27.480
Talk to me.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.240
The toys are out of the box.

16:29.360 --> 16:30.560
Roger that, kung fu master.

16:35.160 --> 16:35.960
It's a miracle.

16:36.080 --> 16:36.840
Praise be.

16:41.440 --> 16:43.120
SPARKY: Ignitable liquidsmake excellent accelerants

16:43.240 --> 16:45.520
because they have a high vaporpressure, low flash-point,

16:45.640 --> 16:47.360
and a relatively widerange between their upper

16:47.480 --> 16:48.920
and lower explosive limits.

16:49.040 --> 16:51.360
Well, this makes ignitableliquids very easy to ignite.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.000
And when mixed with the
proper air/fuel ratio,

16:53.120 --> 16:56.040
you'll find that that
is exactly what happens.

16:56.160 --> 16:58.480
OK.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.720
What are you doing
out of your truck?

16:59.840 --> 17:00.640
Go away.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.480
RITA WEST: Are you OK?

17:04.600 --> 17:05.480
ERIC: I really can't
see this jogging

17:05.600 --> 17:06.360
thing catching on at all.

17:06.480 --> 17:07.680
Eric, did he call?

17:07.800 --> 17:09.560
Yep, Falani called.

17:09.680 --> 17:10.560
Cars are on the road.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.120
What if he doesn't
take the bait?

17:19.240 --> 17:20.800
He will.

17:20.920 --> 17:23.000
WENDY: If he hears anything hashappened to his beloved cars,

17:23.120 --> 17:25.240
I swear he will need tosee it with his own eyes.

17:25.360 --> 17:28.400
And he'll be out of there fasterthan that space shuttle thing.

17:28.520 --> 17:30.600
ERIC: I mean, I love my car,
but if some bastard were

17:30.720 --> 17:32.680
to nick it, I wouldn't driveway the fuck out into the middle

17:32.800 --> 17:33.600
of nowhere just to see.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.840
EVAN LACE: Fuck!

17:34.960 --> 17:35.720
Eric.

17:35.840 --> 17:36.840
What?

17:36.960 --> 17:40.720
RITA WEST: Shut
up and get ready.

17:40.840 --> 17:42.720
[car running]

17:46.840 --> 17:48.320
ERIC: And they're good to go.

17:48.440 --> 17:49.200
Yeah.

18:00.320 --> 18:01.760
RITA WEST: Eric,
what are you wearing?

18:01.880 --> 18:03.200
ERIC: That's my disguise.

18:03.320 --> 18:04.960
When someone is wearing
a hat, witnesses

18:05.080 --> 18:07.560
will always remember the hat,not the person wearing it.

18:07.680 --> 18:08.720
[throat clearing]

18:08.840 --> 18:09.960
You'll see.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.560
Mrs. West, I can't
disable the alarm.

18:12.680 --> 18:13.720
Why not?

18:13.840 --> 18:15.040
MAN 2: Because
it's not turned on.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.480
Also, the door was unlocked.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.560
Wow, it really wasn't hairy.

18:18.680 --> 18:19.920
It's business time, boys.

18:23.640 --> 18:25.400
You know what you'rehere to do, so get to it.

18:29.760 --> 18:32.120
WENDY: Do you know
what I regret the most?

18:32.240 --> 18:34.800
That he didn't die
when you stabbed him?

18:34.920 --> 18:37.880
WENDY: No, actually, now
I'm glad he didn't die,

18:38.000 --> 18:38.800
because of this.

18:50.320 --> 18:52.040
OK.

18:52.160 --> 18:53.960
Get it out of there.

18:54.080 --> 18:57.600
My regret is that I won'tbe there to see his face

18:57.720 --> 18:59.840
when he walks in to find
that everything is gone.

19:09.320 --> 19:13.120
Have you read "The FemaleEunuch," by Germaine Greer?

19:13.240 --> 19:14.440
I like romance novels.

19:14.560 --> 19:15.560
Is it a romance?

19:15.680 --> 19:17.640
No, it's about
empowering women.

19:17.760 --> 19:19.920
About how men keep women down--

19:20.040 --> 19:22.000
how they control us
because of our genitals.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.640
Oh, gosh.

19:23.760 --> 19:26.360
Which is exactly what
Phineas is doing to you.

19:26.480 --> 19:28.800
Is he?

19:28.920 --> 19:31.560
He's making hisinfertility your infertility.

19:31.680 --> 19:34.720
Oh, right, because it'shis balls that don't work,

19:34.840 --> 19:36.280
not mine, so to speak.

19:36.400 --> 19:37.400
NGAIRE MUNROE: Exactly.

19:37.520 --> 19:39.200
Does he really
need to know that?

19:39.320 --> 19:40.520
Damned right, he does.

19:40.640 --> 19:41.560
TED WEST: Well, can it
not be anytime soon?

19:41.680 --> 19:43.800
Where are you off to?

19:43.920 --> 19:46.480
Just got an errand
to run for Rita.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.400
Oh, nice to see there'sat least one man around here

19:48.520 --> 19:50.160
who supports his wife.

19:50.280 --> 19:51.840
Something like that.

19:51.960 --> 19:54.720
I'll leave you ladies to it.

19:54.840 --> 19:57.320
Tell me more about
"The Female Tunic?"

19:57.440 --> 19:59.240
Eunuch.
ERIC: Sorry, love.

19:59.360 --> 20:01.320
Didn't even tell us the
whys-- just the wheres.

20:01.440 --> 20:04.120
All this is off to a placeon Parrot Side Drive.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.720
Maybe he's after a bit
of classy neighbor.

20:05.840 --> 20:07.640
I don't know.

20:07.760 --> 20:08.560
You reckon these are them?

20:11.880 --> 20:12.800
I do, love.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.520
I love the boat.

20:15.640 --> 20:18.640
It's the first thing webought after we got rich.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.320
We went sailing most weekendsjust to get away from it.

20:21.440 --> 20:23.160
We can steal it.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.640
Pack it somewhere
'til you get out.

20:25.760 --> 20:29.280
And there was the weekendhe and a couple business mates

20:29.400 --> 20:33.320
went on a fishing trip
to the Hen and Chickens.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.360
Me and the other wivesdecided to go up to North Inn

20:35.480 --> 20:37.400
and watch them sail out.

20:37.520 --> 20:41.080
What we saw was them
pulling into Davenport

20:41.200 --> 20:44.840
to pick up their girlfriends.

20:44.960 --> 20:47.760
That was the first timeI clapped eyes on Joanne.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.320
SPARKY: I wonder if
there'll be steam

20:49.440 --> 20:51.720
when the fire meets the water.

20:51.840 --> 20:56.200
RITA WEST: Yeah, just don't, youknow, hang around celebrating

20:56.320 --> 20:57.720
the way that you do.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.160
OK.

20:59.280 --> 21:00.040
I'll try.

21:02.520 --> 21:05.920
Burn it to the
fucking water line.

21:06.040 --> 21:07.840
I've got just the
man for the job.

21:11.320 --> 21:13.520
It's the simple
pleasures, eh, buddy?

21:13.640 --> 21:15.400
[motorcycle running]

21:18.800 --> 21:20.400
BILKEY: I'll be honest
with you, sweetheart.

21:20.520 --> 21:22.040
This stuff really isn't you.

21:22.160 --> 21:23.640
RITA WEST: Oh, it's not for me.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.760
Dump it when we're out of here.

21:25.880 --> 21:27.600
BILKEY: You want him to thinkshe's packed up and left.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.200
Just to keep him on
the back foot for a bit.

21:30.320 --> 21:34.480
And what are you going
to do with his stuff?

21:34.600 --> 21:35.760
Burn it.

21:35.880 --> 21:38.840
WENDY: You don't have
to do this for me.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.800
Who says I am?

21:40.920 --> 21:42.360
Selling his stuff--
that's all mine, right?

21:42.480 --> 21:44.240
Yeah.

21:44.360 --> 21:46.560
And half the money
from his rainy day fund.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.560
But I keep the jewelry.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.720
As we agreed.

21:52.840 --> 21:57.880
WENDY: But deep down,
you're doing it for me.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.800
RITA WEST: Well, if believingthat keeps you happy--

22:01.920 --> 22:02.760
It does.

22:08.640 --> 22:10.440
ERIC: Thanks, guys.

22:10.560 --> 22:13.240
Once we get that on board,the truck will be full.

22:13.360 --> 22:16.720
There's no room for this.

22:16.840 --> 22:18.320
Let him keep it.

22:18.440 --> 22:21.120
Well, then it's time for usto blow this Popsicle stand,

22:21.240 --> 22:23.880
I reckon.
- Yep.

22:24.000 --> 22:24.800
I think it is.

22:38.560 --> 22:40.400
[truck running]

22:46.000 --> 22:47.560
Huge bloody coconuts.

22:47.680 --> 22:49.280
Big ass bastards.

22:49.400 --> 22:51.520
I was bloody overpowered.

22:51.640 --> 22:52.480
Coconuts?

22:52.600 --> 22:54.280
You know, jigaboos.

22:54.400 --> 22:55.600
One of them punched
me on the cock.

22:55.720 --> 22:57.040
On your cock?

22:57.160 --> 23:01.480
Yeah, right on the cockas I was going after him.

23:01.600 --> 23:04.320
So what you're telling
me is that a bunch

23:04.440 --> 23:07.600
of islanders pausing onlyto punch you on the cock

23:07.720 --> 23:08.680
stole all my cars.

23:08.800 --> 23:09.880
Yeah.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.640
They really had it
in for you, mate.

23:12.760 --> 23:14.280
ROD: Yeah, knock 20 off
and we've got a deal.

23:14.400 --> 23:15.240
No, we haven't.

23:15.360 --> 23:16.480
The price is the price.

23:16.600 --> 23:17.480
[inaudible]

23:17.600 --> 23:18.880
Thanks, let's.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.600
ERIC: It's a bloody
steal as it is.

23:20.720 --> 23:22.120
ROD: Yeah, because
you bloody stole it.

23:22.240 --> 23:23.800
ERIC: Yeah, and you'retrying to steal it off of me.

23:23.920 --> 23:24.760
Pay up, Rod.

23:28.720 --> 23:30.240
Just about good to go.

23:30.360 --> 23:32.480
Reassure me none of this canbe traced back to us, right?

23:32.600 --> 23:33.960
Oh, give me some credit.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.400
This is all going
offshore into the hands

23:35.520 --> 23:37.480
of the very private collectors.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.640
It will be years before anythingemerges into the public eye

23:39.760 --> 23:42.160
again, and by then, we'llall be distant memories.

23:42.280 --> 23:43.960
Speak for yourself.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.400
Thanks, Bilkey.

23:45.520 --> 23:48.000
I think my 25% will
be thanks enough.

23:48.120 --> 23:49.040
20%.

23:49.160 --> 23:49.960
BILKEY: That's right.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.680
Silly me.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.600
Really nice work, by the way.

23:53.720 --> 23:54.920
Thank you.

23:55.040 --> 23:57.800
Remind me never to
get in your bad books.

23:57.920 --> 23:59.480
All under control here?

23:59.600 --> 24:02.920
Apart from Rod being a dick,this stuff is selling itself.

24:03.040 --> 24:04.720
Anything the slut don't want--

24:04.840 --> 24:06.240
get rid of it where
no one will find it.

24:06.360 --> 24:08.560
I don't want anything toend up at the Galleria, OK.

24:08.680 --> 24:09.560
Gotcha.

24:09.680 --> 24:10.880
RITA WEST: I'm serious, Eric.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.640
I don't want any of
this stuff to turn up

24:12.760 --> 24:14.440
at a garage sale at your place.

24:14.560 --> 24:16.560
- Yeah, I saw that, Rod.
- What?

24:16.680 --> 24:18.400
Whatever it was youjust put down your pants.

24:18.520 --> 24:19.400
Put it back.

24:30.240 --> 24:31.080
A bit quiet, isn't it?

24:31.200 --> 24:33.320
Yep.

24:33.440 --> 24:34.240
I wonder where Ted is.

24:36.960 --> 24:38.320
And Bert.

24:38.440 --> 24:41.000
Yeah, I think they'releaving us out of something.

24:41.120 --> 24:44.440
Like maybe we're still in thedog box for doing the RSA job.

24:44.560 --> 24:45.960
Sh.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.640
That's gone-- done and dusted.Everything's forgiven.

24:47.760 --> 24:48.960
Yeah, we clinked
bottles on it.

24:49.080 --> 24:49.880
That's right.

24:50.000 --> 24:50.800
Ted forgave you.

24:50.920 --> 24:52.000
And you, too.

24:52.120 --> 24:53.880
You know, sometimes I wonder--

24:54.000 --> 24:55.800
we're meant to be more
than just a gang, right?

24:55.920 --> 24:58.400
We're mates, aren't we?

24:58.520 --> 24:59.280
I guess.

24:59.400 --> 25:00.760
So why is it too quiet?

25:00.880 --> 25:02.640
You think maybe cause we'vedone a job without them,

25:02.760 --> 25:04.120
they're doing a job without us?

25:04.240 --> 25:06.520
Maybe we should go
and check in on Ted,

25:06.640 --> 25:07.400
just to make sure he's OK.

25:18.960 --> 25:19.800
RITA WEST: Can you crack it?

25:23.240 --> 25:24.000
Sorry.

25:27.720 --> 25:30.000
I have a new respect
for you, you know.

25:30.120 --> 25:31.720
A simple plan
and we stuck to it.

25:31.840 --> 25:33.240
Not the job.

25:33.360 --> 25:35.440
Your friends.

25:35.560 --> 25:39.040
Carol turns up all waterworksand flapping hands,

25:39.160 --> 25:43.120
waving around some letter abouthow Phineas is firing blanks.

25:43.240 --> 25:46.360
Next, Ngaire's there too,pouring gins and talking up

25:46.480 --> 25:48.440
some book about Munich.

25:48.560 --> 25:49.920
Welcome to my world.

25:50.040 --> 25:55.520
TED WEST: Yeah, you'regood with them and our boy.

25:55.640 --> 25:57.440
Don't worry about Wolf.

25:57.560 --> 25:59.080
He's just going through
a phase where he

25:59.200 --> 26:01.000
needs to push people's buttons.

26:01.120 --> 26:03.000
TED WEST: He's doing a
bloody good job on me.

26:03.120 --> 26:04.320
RITA WEST: Because
you let him, Ted.

26:04.440 --> 26:06.400
There was a time
he looked up to me.

26:06.520 --> 26:08.800
He still does.

26:08.920 --> 26:11.520
But no, that's bullshit.

26:11.640 --> 26:13.800
Not my boy anymore.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.000
Someone else.

26:15.120 --> 26:17.280
Well, that's what
happens, isn't it?

26:17.400 --> 26:18.440
With fathers and sons.

26:18.560 --> 26:19.560
TED WEST: Just never
thought I'd end

26:19.680 --> 26:22.800
up having a son who hates me.

26:22.920 --> 26:26.200
Shouldn't you be concentratingon the safe right about now.

26:26.320 --> 26:29.880
What was that thing that wewere going to do in the States?

26:30.000 --> 26:32.640
And the Cadillac?

26:32.760 --> 26:34.960
You mean as we'redriving across the desert?

26:35.080 --> 26:36.640
RITA WEST: And one
of us is naked.

26:36.760 --> 26:38.040
Only one of us?

26:38.160 --> 26:39.000
RITA WEST: Well, I'm driving.

26:39.120 --> 26:40.480
I can't be naked.

26:40.600 --> 26:43.280
But it's OK to have anaked woman across your lap?

26:43.400 --> 26:44.480
It is if it's you.

26:59.080 --> 26:59.920
What the fuck?

27:06.040 --> 27:08.360
CAROL: It's not all
bad being barren.

27:08.480 --> 27:11.880
I've got a great job, I
get to travel the world,

27:12.000 --> 27:15.320
and my workmates--
they're just fabulous.

27:15.440 --> 27:17.640
Ricardo-- he's the head
steward on my shift.

27:17.760 --> 27:18.920
He's hilarious.

27:19.040 --> 27:20.400
NGAIRE MUNROE: Oh yeah?

27:20.520 --> 27:22.520
CAROL: He's got
such a great body.

27:22.640 --> 27:25.800
Goes to the gym all the timeand he's got that olive skin.

27:25.920 --> 27:27.640
NGAIRE MUNROE: Sounds likeyou've got a bit of a crush.

27:27.760 --> 27:29.400
Stop it.

27:29.520 --> 27:32.360
He's too cosmopolitan for me.

27:32.480 --> 27:36.120
He had frosted hair
before anybody else.

27:36.240 --> 27:38.400
He sings like an angel.

27:38.520 --> 27:40.840
He and I do musical numbersat takeoff and landing.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.080
It really relaxes
the passengers.

27:43.200 --> 27:46.520
NGAIRE MUNROE: Well, that aside,I've got one word for you.

27:46.640 --> 27:48.200
Sperm donor.

27:48.320 --> 27:49.480
That's two words.

27:49.600 --> 27:50.760
NGAIRE MUNROE: No,
Carol, what I'm saying

27:50.880 --> 27:52.800
is that you should
get Ricardo to donate

27:52.920 --> 27:54.560
his sperm to your womb.

27:54.680 --> 27:57.520
Are you saying I
should milk Ricardo?

27:57.640 --> 28:00.280
No, I'm saying you shouldexplain to him your problem,

28:00.400 --> 28:04.000
and then get him to rootyou 'til you're pregnant.

28:04.120 --> 28:05.960
Ngaire, you're dreadful.

28:06.080 --> 28:09.680
It's not a bad idea, right?

28:09.800 --> 28:12.120
LEFTY MUNROE: Oh, my wife.

28:12.240 --> 28:15.200
The tree that the love
of my life hangs upon.

28:15.320 --> 28:16.920
PHINEAS: Hey, sweetie.

28:17.040 --> 28:18.240
LEFTY MUNROE: We just
thought we'd check

28:18.360 --> 28:20.000
in on our illustrious leader.

28:20.120 --> 28:20.880
He around?

28:21.000 --> 28:21.800
No.

28:21.920 --> 28:22.680
Rita?

28:22.800 --> 28:23.720
Mm-mm.

28:23.840 --> 28:24.960
Interesting.

28:25.080 --> 28:26.000
CAROL: We have the
place to ourselves.

28:26.120 --> 28:27.560
Really?

28:27.680 --> 28:29.280
PHINEAS: Is there anythingelse to drink, besides gin?

28:29.400 --> 28:31.640
Ask and the west will provide.

28:46.160 --> 28:46.960
Joanne?

28:52.000 --> 28:52.800
Joanne?

29:14.960 --> 29:15.720
Fuck!

29:24.320 --> 29:26.400
Oh, for fuck's sake.

29:26.520 --> 29:28.280
What are they doing here?

29:28.400 --> 29:31.760
Rita, stuff like this happens.

29:31.880 --> 29:33.280
Drunk people turning
up at my house.

29:33.400 --> 29:33.960
Tell me about it.
- No.

29:34.080 --> 29:34.720
Hey, hey, hey.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.600
The job.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.880
Sometimes, the take
isn't what you'd expect.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.600
Been loads of times
that me and the boys

29:40.720 --> 29:43.200
have walked away with less.

29:43.320 --> 29:45.840
It was supposed
to be there, Ted.

29:45.960 --> 29:47.960
It's still a great haul.

29:48.080 --> 29:50.880
The cars, the
stuff, the artwork.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.720
It's not what I went after.

29:52.840 --> 29:54.680
It's OK.

29:54.800 --> 29:58.240
You did great is all I'm saying.

29:58.360 --> 30:03.320
Plus we got another
big haul coming, right?

30:03.440 --> 30:04.400
The South African job.

30:08.080 --> 30:08.880
Come on.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
PHINEAS: Ah, here they are.

30:16.120 --> 30:17.760
We just dropped in
to say hello, mate,

30:17.880 --> 30:19.320
and well, people
keep showing up.

30:19.440 --> 30:20.240
Sorry.

30:20.360 --> 30:21.920
That's not a problem Lefty.

30:22.040 --> 30:23.440
Good to see people
enjoying themselves.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.240
It is, isn't it.

30:25.360 --> 30:27.080
What a nice surprise.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.200
Thanks, Ngaire.

30:28.320 --> 30:29.160
You're welcome, Rita.

30:33.440 --> 30:34.720
Phineas doesn't know nothing.

30:34.840 --> 30:37.080
I've told him nothing,
so say nothing.

30:37.200 --> 30:39.600
That's what I said
in the first place.

30:39.720 --> 30:40.560
RITA WEST: Got a light?

30:40.680 --> 30:43.200
- Always.
- Is it done?

30:43.320 --> 30:44.800
Oh, it was magical.

30:44.920 --> 30:47.280
The flame took the boat andthe mooring rope burnt through,

30:47.400 --> 30:50.920
so it sailed away intoanother boat and another boat

30:51.040 --> 30:52.240
and another boat.

30:52.360 --> 30:54.720
It was like a symphony
of fire all burning

30:54.840 --> 30:56.480
like a Viking funeral.

30:56.600 --> 30:58.200
Good job, I think.

31:02.360 --> 31:03.400
NGAIRE MUNROE: No, no, no.

31:03.520 --> 31:04.480
Well, I mean, it
goes into that, too.

31:04.600 --> 31:05.760
But it's sort of about--

31:05.880 --> 31:07.440
Good evening, boys.

31:07.560 --> 31:08.880
Is it?

31:09.000 --> 31:10.560
We arrive for the debriefand this is going on.

31:10.680 --> 31:12.920
Yeah, well, keep the
debrief quick and quiet.

31:13.040 --> 31:14.240
It's all good.

31:14.360 --> 31:15.640
FALANI: The cars have
gone places far away

31:15.760 --> 31:17.760
and my cousins say that
you are a great woman.

31:17.880 --> 31:18.760
And they were honored to be--

31:18.880 --> 31:20.440
I said quick, Falani.

31:20.560 --> 31:21.440
My apologies.

31:21.560 --> 31:23.080
I'm still giddy with excitement.

31:23.200 --> 31:24.120
I wish I could say the same.

31:41.600 --> 31:45.000
[sighing]

31:45.120 --> 31:47.640
They missed this.

31:47.760 --> 31:50.040
They took everything.

31:50.160 --> 31:52.400
Left the bottle of
12-year-old scotch.

31:52.520 --> 31:54.360
I think they're taunting me.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.360
What the fuck happened?

31:56.480 --> 31:58.800
I'm not entirely sure.

31:58.920 --> 31:59.720
You know?

31:59.840 --> 32:00.640
Me?

32:00.760 --> 32:01.560
How would I know?

32:05.280 --> 32:06.480
All this.

32:06.600 --> 32:09.600
All my cars-- gone.

32:09.720 --> 32:10.480
You've seen my cars, right?

32:10.600 --> 32:12.040
You remember them?

32:12.160 --> 32:13.280
Yeah, I've seen them.

32:13.400 --> 32:16.280
I didn't take them
or any of this.

32:16.400 --> 32:19.240
I've been up north
all day, remember?

32:19.360 --> 32:21.040
Oh yeah.

32:21.160 --> 32:24.640
How are our South
African friends?

32:24.760 --> 32:28.160
They're fucking
pigs, to be honest.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.520
They went out to a boat.

32:29.640 --> 32:30.960
When they came back,
they were carrying two

32:31.080 --> 32:33.800
bags they didn't have before.

32:33.920 --> 32:35.040
Hell boy.

32:35.160 --> 32:36.720
[non-english speech]

32:41.960 --> 32:43.360
Not that that matters anymore.

32:43.480 --> 32:45.480
Oh, it matters a lot morethan it did this morning.

32:48.520 --> 32:49.680
Have you called the cops?

32:49.800 --> 32:51.400
[laughter]

32:51.520 --> 32:52.840
You just got bent
over, big time.

32:52.960 --> 32:54.200
And tell them what?

32:54.320 --> 32:56.640
That a bunch of stolen
cars got stolen again?

32:56.760 --> 32:57.560
They were stolen?

32:57.680 --> 32:58.520
Well, I presume so.

32:58.640 --> 33:00.080
I'd tell Spiller what I wanted.

33:00.200 --> 33:01.800
He'd go and get them for me,and I would never ask how.

33:01.920 --> 33:03.800
Why the fuck do you
think I kept them

33:03.920 --> 33:06.720
locked in a garage in themiddle of fucking nowhere, Wolf?

33:06.840 --> 33:08.840
You know, this might come as alittle bit of a shock to you,

33:08.960 --> 33:11.600
but a lot of my life isn't real.

33:11.720 --> 33:12.960
You know half the
bloody paintings

33:13.080 --> 33:15.640
that they took are fake.
That's how I met Joanne.

33:15.760 --> 33:18.360
Her and her bloody
gay mate, Veronica,

33:18.480 --> 33:21.000
trying to sell me a
bogus Gordon Wallis.

33:21.120 --> 33:22.920
[laughter]

33:26.920 --> 33:31.000
I fell in love with Joannewhen I confronted her about it,

33:31.120 --> 33:32.600
and she looked me in the
eyes and she asked me,

33:32.720 --> 33:36.000
what was I going to do about?

33:36.120 --> 33:37.440
Mind you, she was
naked at the time,

33:37.560 --> 33:39.360
and right until
before that moment,

33:39.480 --> 33:41.280
my cock had been
inside her, so--

33:46.160 --> 33:48.120
so what should I tell
the police, Wolf?

33:48.240 --> 33:50.880
That my con artist girlfriendreverted to types and a bunch

33:51.000 --> 33:52.560
of cock punchingislander's and Daniel Boone

33:52.680 --> 33:53.880
with a clipboard
to clear me out?

33:56.720 --> 33:59.480
Did she have to burn
my fucking clothes?

33:59.600 --> 34:00.400
This is cruel.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.560
Tell me you and her weren'tin on this together.

34:13.560 --> 34:14.840
We weren't in on it together.

34:21.200 --> 34:22.800
EVAN LACE: One mad bitchtries to stab me to death.

34:22.920 --> 34:24.360
The other one takes me
for everything I've got.

34:24.480 --> 34:26.160
Fuck.

34:26.280 --> 34:27.400
I need to get better
taste in women.

34:31.840 --> 34:33.360
RITA WEST: Everything sorted?

34:33.480 --> 34:35.520
If Falani has an after match,I'd have sorted it ages ago.

34:35.640 --> 34:36.840
Not an after match.

34:36.960 --> 34:38.360
Not a word to anyone
who wasn't there.

34:38.480 --> 34:39.880
Discretion is my
middle name, Rita.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.600
And yep, everything is sorted.

34:41.720 --> 34:45.680
Apart from Rod bloodymoaning about everything.

34:45.800 --> 34:47.640
I got you a present.

34:47.760 --> 34:50.760
It's a grapefruit knife
for your grapefruit.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.560
- Is this from his place?- Of course it is.

34:52.680 --> 34:53.920
It's just one little knife.

34:54.040 --> 34:56.000
Eric, I told younothing was to stay here.

34:56.120 --> 34:58.480
No, all the othercutlery went to [inaudible]

34:58.600 --> 35:00.960
You could say you bought
it here, if anyone asks.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.200
All right.
Thank you, Eric.

35:15.720 --> 35:17.560
You.

35:17.680 --> 35:19.480
Come with me.

35:19.600 --> 35:21.080
Yeah.

35:21.200 --> 35:23.480
I mean, everything you saidabout the tour was so right.

35:23.600 --> 35:24.880
TED WEST: Yeah.

35:25.000 --> 35:25.880
Thanks for that, Burt.

35:36.080 --> 35:37.240
RITA WEST: Have you
talked to him yet?

35:37.360 --> 35:38.440
Yeah.

35:38.560 --> 35:40.320
And yeah, your
precious cargo is here.

35:40.440 --> 35:43.520
And yeah, he totally thinksJoanne did it, so it worked.

35:43.640 --> 35:45.120
Well done.

35:45.240 --> 35:47.200
Wolf, can you
think of any reason

35:47.320 --> 35:49.440
why when we opened the
safe, it was empty?

35:52.640 --> 35:56.120
There was stuff in
there when I saw it.

35:56.240 --> 35:58.320
You say he blames Joanne.

35:58.440 --> 35:59.200
Is she there?

35:59.320 --> 36:02.360
Is she back at the house?

36:02.480 --> 36:06.040
Well, she was off
playing tennis, was it?

36:06.160 --> 36:08.760
Did she ever come back?

36:08.880 --> 36:09.640
No.

36:13.160 --> 36:15.440
Wolf, did she know that
we were coming today.

36:15.560 --> 36:17.000
No, not exactly.

36:17.120 --> 36:19.320
Would you still be with
him if he had nothing?

36:19.440 --> 36:20.760
No one ever knows
what's coming tomorrow.

36:26.080 --> 36:28.280
Are you OK?

36:28.400 --> 36:30.880
You're right.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.840
You never know when shitmight be about to hit the fan.

36:33.960 --> 36:35.480
RITA WEST: What does
not exactly mean?

36:35.600 --> 36:36.800
Well, I didn't
want you hurting her,

36:36.920 --> 36:37.960
so I told her to stay
away from the place.

36:38.080 --> 36:39.560
That's all.

36:39.680 --> 36:42.680
Well, unless Lace has thestuff, she saw her opportunity

36:42.800 --> 36:44.600
and she took it.

36:44.720 --> 36:45.520
He hasn't got it.

36:45.640 --> 36:46.400
He's a total mess.

36:46.520 --> 36:49.360
Boo fucking hoo.

36:49.480 --> 36:51.680
Fuck.

36:51.800 --> 36:53.320
Fuck.

36:53.440 --> 36:56.240
She had it in her fucking bagand she drove right past us.

36:56.360 --> 36:57.760
Oh, she bloody
played you, mate.

36:57.880 --> 36:58.880
No, she didn't.

36:59.000 --> 36:59.720
Were you sleeping
with her, Wolf?

36:59.840 --> 37:00.880
Were you fucking her?

37:01.000 --> 37:02.360
TED WEST: Yeah, she
was playing you.

37:02.480 --> 37:03.360
WOLF WEST: If she were theretoday when you went in,

37:03.480 --> 37:04.640
what would you have done to her?

37:04.760 --> 37:06.800
I would have tied
her up, kept her quiet,

37:06.920 --> 37:08.560
left her for him to find.I'm not a bloody murderer.

37:08.680 --> 37:10.320
But she wasn't there and
neither was the money,

37:10.440 --> 37:11.520
and we have you
to thank for that.

37:11.640 --> 37:12.760
You betrayed this family.

37:12.880 --> 37:13.760
Don't start with that!

37:13.880 --> 37:15.080
TED WEST: Why not?

37:15.200 --> 37:16.160
You did and you cost
us a bloody [inaudible]

37:16.280 --> 37:17.520
[knocking]
- Not now.

37:17.640 --> 37:19.640
CAROL: Is Wolf in there?
- I said not now, Carol.

37:19.760 --> 37:21.280
There's someone
here for Wolf--

37:21.400 --> 37:22.520
a woman.

37:22.640 --> 37:24.240
You never said Wolf
had a girlfriend.

37:40.920 --> 37:41.960
Everybody needs to leave.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.160
Go on.

37:48.280 --> 37:49.600
None of you were bloodyinvited here, so bugger off.

37:49.720 --> 37:51.880
TED WEST: We just need a
bit of family time, eh.

37:52.000 --> 37:52.800
Just a bit of space.

37:52.920 --> 37:54.840
Nothing to worry about.

37:54.960 --> 37:56.000
Burt, Phin, Lefty--

37:56.120 --> 37:57.000
I'll show it to you tomorrow.

38:06.320 --> 38:07.960
We met once at a party.

38:08.080 --> 38:10.280
We did.

38:10.400 --> 38:12.680
And then you used my son.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.520
JOANNE: I never used Wolfe.

38:14.640 --> 38:16.120
Didn't you?

38:16.240 --> 38:17.600
I just couldn't tell himhe'd given me the opportunity

38:17.720 --> 38:19.680
I'd been waiting for.

38:19.800 --> 38:20.600
Thank you for that.

38:20.720 --> 38:22.120
RITA WEST: Right.

38:22.240 --> 38:24.320
That would be the opportunityto rip off your fiance.

38:24.440 --> 38:28.800
Isn't that exactly whatyou were using your son for?

38:28.920 --> 38:30.920
Where you in one of the trucks?

38:31.040 --> 38:33.760
They weren't exactly subtle.

38:33.880 --> 38:34.800
Did the business.

38:34.920 --> 38:35.760
Oh, I know.

38:35.880 --> 38:37.120
OK, are we good to go here?

38:37.240 --> 38:39.000
JOANNE: I came back and
I watched for a while.

38:39.120 --> 38:40.960
You must have done prettywell out of that haul.

38:41.080 --> 38:42.760
Not as well as expected.

38:42.880 --> 38:45.000
JOANNE: I can't help you there.

38:45.120 --> 38:46.920
So you didn't take the bonds.

38:47.040 --> 38:51.800
Yeah, I took them, but they'rehalfway to America by now.

38:51.920 --> 38:54.960
Do you know anything about art?

38:55.080 --> 38:57.480
I mean, it's OK if
you don't, because it

38:57.600 --> 38:59.960
really is true that art isin the eye of the beholder.

39:05.280 --> 39:07.960
The artwork is going toa secure storage facility

39:08.080 --> 39:09.640
somewhere in the States.

39:09.760 --> 39:11.360
I'm not going to tell
you where, and it

39:11.480 --> 39:13.440
can only be claimed by me.

39:13.560 --> 39:17.960
So those bonds, or my future,as I like to think of them,

39:18.080 --> 39:22.680
are well and truly gone,as far as you're concerned.

39:22.800 --> 39:24.360
What about the jewelry?

39:24.480 --> 39:25.760
What jewelry?

39:25.880 --> 39:27.080
RITA WEST: In the safe.

39:27.200 --> 39:28.200
JOANNE: There was no
jewelry in the safe.

39:28.320 --> 39:29.800
Yes, there was.

39:29.920 --> 39:33.360
Oh, you mean Evan's watchesand cuff links and so forth.

39:33.480 --> 39:34.960
I'd hardly call them jewelry.

39:35.080 --> 39:37.640
Also, I sold them to
pay for plane tickets.

39:37.760 --> 39:40.200
I mean Belinda's jewelry.

39:40.320 --> 39:42.960
Oh my God.

39:43.080 --> 39:46.760
Did mad Belinda put
you up to all this?

39:46.880 --> 39:49.920
She chucked every trinket Evanever bought her off the yacht

39:50.040 --> 39:52.640
in the middle of some argument.

39:52.760 --> 39:56.200
There is no jewelry.

39:56.320 --> 39:58.120
Why have you come here?

39:58.240 --> 40:01.640
To see Wolf, of course.

40:01.760 --> 40:06.800
To see if he would like tocome with me on an adventure.

40:06.920 --> 40:10.400
Like I said, there's a planeticket if you have a passport.

40:10.520 --> 40:11.320
Do you have a passport?

40:11.440 --> 40:12.240
TED WEST: No.

40:12.360 --> 40:13.840
You're not taking my son.

40:13.960 --> 40:15.480
JOANNE: I think that's verymuch up to Wolf, don't you?

40:15.600 --> 40:16.520
- Hey, hey hey.
- Mom, leave it!

40:16.640 --> 40:17.400
Rita, come on.

40:23.400 --> 40:27.040
An adventure sounds good.

40:27.160 --> 40:29.840
Oh, it will be.

40:29.960 --> 40:34.840
'til the day you get boredof me, and then you'll leave.

40:34.960 --> 40:37.040
He loves you.

40:37.160 --> 40:39.040
He really does.

40:39.160 --> 40:40.080
That was his problem.

40:43.200 --> 40:44.600
Yeah, well I'm not
going to make it mine.

40:48.120 --> 40:48.920
JOANNE: Pity.

40:53.280 --> 40:54.080
You were fun.

41:07.000 --> 41:07.840
Thank you, Wolf.

41:10.960 --> 41:12.520
I did it for me, not you.

41:19.440 --> 41:20.360
Hey.

41:20.480 --> 41:21.240
It's OK.

41:24.280 --> 41:25.520
It's OK.

41:25.640 --> 41:27.320
We did good.

41:27.440 --> 41:29.120
Today's a good day, yeah?

41:29.240 --> 41:30.320
[music playing]

41:41.240 --> 41:44.120
[SINGING] God how
I wish it were so.

41:48.760 --> 41:50.440
Go home.

41:53.240 --> 41:58.840
Here comes the candle
to light you to bed.

41:58.960 --> 42:03.640
Here comes the chopper
to chop off your head.

42:08.240 --> 42:14.440
Don't let me down, kid.

42:20.240 --> 42:23.120
Don't let me down.

42:29.240 --> 42:33.680
Stop crying now.
