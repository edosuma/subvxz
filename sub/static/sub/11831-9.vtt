You saved her life,
Benny.
Whatever.

38:50.891 --> 38:53.491
I gotta go. I gotta go.
You gonna be okay?

38:56.491 --> 38:58.557
Not if Aikman finds out.

39:00.124 --> 39:02.657
So how does it go now?

39:02.724 --> 39:06.091
Well, I think
they'll offer immunity
if she'll turn over Aikman.

39:06.157 --> 39:09.657
The amount of cocaine,
they've got leverage. They could
put her away for a long time.

39:09.724 --> 39:12.757
He'll kill her.
[ Elevator Bell Dings ]

39:12.824 --> 39:15.791
He will kill her,
and she'll never get to testify.

39:22.157 --> 39:24.024
He's gonna kill both of us.

39:30.524 --> 39:35.324
Copying costs, filing fees,
stuff like that,
you'd be expected to pay.

39:35.391 --> 39:37.424
[ Man ]
Okay.

39:37.491 --> 39:41.891
The first thing will be to get
by the summary judgment hearing,
which we should be able to do.

39:41.957 --> 39:45.824
I'll put in a call to opposing
counsel. Do you know who's
representing the state?

39:45.891 --> 39:50.391
Uh, a big firm--
F-Finley Hogue-something.

39:50.457 --> 39:53.257
What, do you know 'em?

39:53.324 --> 39:55.924
They got a good reputation.

39:55.991 --> 40:00.357
Okay.
Look, uh, we got a lot to do.
I got all the files.

40:00.424 --> 40:03.924
Your old lawyer says
he's happy to cooperate
whenever I need him.

40:03.991 --> 40:06.424
This is good.
[ Chuckles ]
This is good.

40:06.491 --> 40:09.057
<i>We're off!</i>

40:11.991 --> 40:14.791
Other than "thank you"?

40:14.857 --> 40:18.757
Well, anything to,
uh, give meaning
to somebody's life.

40:18.824 --> 40:23.457
I had to make it more full,
rounded, complete.

40:23.524 --> 40:25.691
Funny.
And funny, yes.

40:25.757 --> 40:30.224
We, uh--
We all need complete,
round, funny lives.

40:30.291 --> 40:34.824
Uh, listen, I don't mean
to be draggin' my heels
like an old mule.

40:34.891 --> 40:37.424
I sense this.

40:37.491 --> 40:40.024
That's why I hang around.

40:40.091 --> 40:43.024
I know somewhere
in there you...

40:43.091 --> 40:45.024
appreciate me.

40:46.691 --> 40:49.024
I do.

41:04.057 --> 41:06.724
Wasn't so terrible, was it?

41:30.157 --> 41:32.024
<i>[ Phone Rings ]</i>

41:36.057 --> 41:37.991
Lindsay Dole.

41:39.824 --> 41:41.724
What?

41:54.024 --> 41:57.191
We don't know if there's family
or anybody else to make an I.D.
Sorry to do this.

41:57.257 --> 41:59.357
It's okay.

42:13.357 --> 42:15.924
[ Daly ]
It's three gunshot wounds.

42:17.124 --> 42:19.524
That's him. John Aikman.

42:21.124 --> 42:23.024
Would you have...

42:24.457 --> 42:26.557
any idea who--

42:27.691 --> 42:30.024
None.

43:08.057 --> 43:09.557

<i>You stinker!</i>
