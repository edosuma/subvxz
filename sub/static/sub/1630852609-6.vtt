WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:03.237
This is not RuPaul's
Best Friend Race.

00:03.237 --> 00:04.771
I feel very attacked!

00:04.771 --> 00:07.808
If you don't have star quality,
get the fuck outta here.

00:07.808 --> 00:10.510
Oh, my God.

00:10.510 --> 00:14.348
RuPaul: This is Untucked,
backstage at the competition

00:14.348 --> 00:18.318
to become America's
next drag superstar.

00:18.318 --> 00:20.220
Girl, if you're not watching
Untucked,

00:20.220 --> 00:22.990
you're only getting
half the story.

00:22.990 --> 00:25.425
Prep Untucked cameras
on the main stage, please.

00:27.694 --> 00:30.631
Daya Betty.

00:30.631 --> 00:31.632
Willow Pill.

00:31.632 --> 00:32.966
Bosco.

00:34.301 --> 00:35.302
Kerri Colby.

00:37.070 --> 00:40.474
Ladies, you are safe.

00:40.474 --> 00:41.775
You may leave the stage.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.319
Oh, my God,
are you kidding me?

00:52.319 --> 00:53.620
I'm not happy

00:53.620 --> 00:55.789
that I've constantly
been safe.

00:55.789 --> 00:58.191
I put so much time
and emotion

00:58.191 --> 01:00.627
into this runway.

01:00.627 --> 01:03.263
Moving forward,
I need to focus on me,

01:03.263 --> 01:05.599
and I'm letting you all know
right now.

01:11.672 --> 01:14.875
I keep ending up safe,
so at this point,

01:14.875 --> 01:17.210
I am feeling a little bit
of some type of way.

01:17.210 --> 01:20.447
But it is another shot
at a new week.

01:20.447 --> 01:24.017
But I didn't come here
to be safe at all. Ever.

01:26.853 --> 01:28.522
Untucked cameras
to the werkroom.

01:28.522 --> 01:29.589
Queens walking.

01:31.058 --> 01:32.326
Whew!

01:32.326 --> 01:34.461
I need a drinkie.

01:34.461 --> 01:36.296
Where's my drinkie?

01:36.296 --> 01:38.031
♪ Get me a drink ♪

01:38.031 --> 01:39.933
[humming]

01:39.933 --> 01:42.803
Bosco, would you mind
untucking my shoe?

01:42.803 --> 01:44.204
What's it called?
Unbuckling.

01:44.204 --> 01:45.405
Unbuckling? Yeah.

01:45.405 --> 01:49.476
Well, ladies, how do we feel?

01:49.476 --> 01:50.777
I'm a little confused.

01:50.777 --> 01:53.313
I didn't know exactly
how this was going to play out,

01:53.313 --> 01:56.750
but I don't know
where any of those people

01:56.750 --> 02:00.320
just are currently placed
out there right now.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.321
-Miss Kerri.
-Yeah?

02:01.321 --> 02:02.322
What are you thinking?

02:02.322 --> 02:04.424
I--I don't know.

02:04.424 --> 02:06.526
I'm just sick of being safe.

02:06.526 --> 02:07.627
Bitch, me, too.

02:07.627 --> 02:10.897
But we for sure
will be here next week.

02:10.897 --> 02:12.299
-Yay.
-Awesome.

02:12.299 --> 02:15.736
I thought there was
a lot of really strong outfits

02:15.736 --> 02:16.770
in this group.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.105
The same.

02:18.105 --> 02:20.073
And to not mince words,
I'm not really sure

02:20.073 --> 02:22.743
where DeJa or Jasmine
fit into that lineup.

02:22.743 --> 02:25.712
'Cause I thought
they were safe.

02:25.712 --> 02:27.681
I'm sorry. Jasmine
literally wraps

02:27.681 --> 02:30.083
just fabric around
her body with a belt.

02:33.353 --> 02:36.323
And I'm not
body shaming whatever.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.324
It's just, like, so annoying

02:37.324 --> 02:38.558
when someone has
a perfect physique

02:38.558 --> 02:39.926
and they can get away

02:39.926 --> 02:42.095
with wrapping a piece of fucking
fabric around their body.

02:42.095 --> 02:43.163
I could not go out there

02:43.163 --> 02:45.665
with just fabric
wrapped around my body.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.935
I started from just
the idea in my head.

02:48.935 --> 02:52.205
I had a concept
based around this little thing.

02:52.205 --> 02:54.207
And you created,
like, a whole moment.

02:54.207 --> 02:55.442
No, for sure.

02:55.442 --> 02:56.777
And no shade to y'all

02:56.777 --> 02:59.346
that used the body things
that they provided for us,

02:59.346 --> 03:02.382
but it's, like, I had,
like, a conceptual idea.

03:02.382 --> 03:03.984
I mean, I did
not only an outfit,

03:03.984 --> 03:06.853
I did little socks,
I did my shoes,

03:06.853 --> 03:08.722
I did accessories,

03:08.722 --> 03:10.757
I did a new pair
of fucking eyeballs,

03:10.757 --> 03:12.292
I did gloves.

03:12.292 --> 03:13.326
It's, like,
I definitely think

03:13.326 --> 03:15.328
I would've pushed past
being safe.

03:15.328 --> 03:17.731
I completely thought
you were gonna be in the top.

03:17.731 --> 03:22.235
This looks like
a professionally made garment.

03:22.235 --> 03:23.537
This looks like
something you brought,

03:23.537 --> 03:24.871
not like something you made.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.006
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.974
And given this challenge,
that's, like--

03:27.974 --> 03:29.910
even the girls that can sew,

03:29.910 --> 03:31.711
that's mind boggling.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.513
It's just, like,
really disheartening

03:33.513 --> 03:36.783
toward someone that literally
started from scratch

03:36.783 --> 03:38.919
with the materials provided.

03:38.919 --> 03:41.455
And, like,
when people go out there

03:41.455 --> 03:43.123
and they just have
a nice garment

03:43.123 --> 03:44.724
that looks pretty

03:44.724 --> 03:46.660
but there's no concept
behind it

03:46.660 --> 03:48.628
other than
I wanna look pretty,

03:48.628 --> 03:49.629
it makes me so mad.

03:49.629 --> 03:51.331
Because for me,
I like to have

03:51.331 --> 03:53.900
some sort of story
behind what I'm doing

03:53.900 --> 03:56.269
or, like, some sort
of something behind it.

03:56.269 --> 03:58.839
If it gives you
any piece of mind,

03:58.839 --> 04:02.175
I genuinely don't think
Jasmine is in the top.

04:02.175 --> 04:05.445
So I don't want you
to spend too much time, like--

04:05.445 --> 04:06.880
I know. Ugh.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.381
I don't know
if I would have won,

04:08.381 --> 04:10.484
because let's be honest,
Lady's was fucking killer.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.486
-Lady did turn it.
-Oh, yeah.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.020
But, like, I at least thought

04:14.020 --> 04:17.057
I would not be sitting
in the safe zone,

04:17.057 --> 04:19.059
I'd at least be in the top.

04:19.059 --> 04:20.727
And I hate to sound
like a bitch,

04:20.727 --> 04:22.262
because I literally hate

04:22.262 --> 04:23.396
listening to girls
talk like this.

04:23.396 --> 04:24.865
It's so fucking annoying to me.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.200
But, like, I get it.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.836
I'll be very interested
to see who makes the top.

04:29.836 --> 04:31.671
Because if it is a girl

04:31.671 --> 04:34.207
that just glued shit
to her bodysuit,

04:34.207 --> 04:36.343
I'm gonna be a little pissed.

04:36.343 --> 04:41.581
I mean, I've been safe
every week.

04:41.581 --> 04:42.983
Yeah.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.819
I don't know what's working
and what's not working.

04:45.819 --> 04:48.088
And, like, I felt like this week

04:48.088 --> 04:50.590
was gonna be
a really good week for me,

04:50.590 --> 04:56.029
and it's just, like, really
fucking annoying to me.

04:56.029 --> 04:58.532
Miss Willow,
give us your moment.

04:58.532 --> 05:03.570
I'm feeling, like,
really happy to be safe

05:03.570 --> 05:06.640
because, I don't know,
I was, like, freaking out

05:06.640 --> 05:07.707
that I was gonna
have to lip sync,

05:07.707 --> 05:09.876
and in this
uncomfortable outfit.

05:09.876 --> 05:12.679
Then I was just really happy
when I saw it today.

05:12.679 --> 05:14.848
I was thinking, like,
there was a possibility

05:14.848 --> 05:17.083
I could be in the top
if they didn't see

05:17.083 --> 05:20.387
all the little things
that are not so clean.

05:20.387 --> 05:23.623
I think if I had
cleaned up all the edges

05:23.623 --> 05:26.493
and it didn't look
as crafty as it did,

05:26.493 --> 05:27.861
then it would be in the top.

05:27.861 --> 05:31.097
But as far as concepts go,
I think I had the best concept.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.901
What was the concept, exactly?

05:34.901 --> 05:38.872
Like, a child's, like,
stuffed animal nightmare.

05:40.540 --> 05:41.708
I got the vibe.

05:41.708 --> 05:42.943
I just wanted to know
exactly what it was.

05:42.943 --> 05:47.214
I mean, my concept
is never based in reality.

05:47.214 --> 05:50.250
No, but I'm really happy,
and I felt proud of it,

05:50.250 --> 05:51.651
and this is very me,

05:51.651 --> 05:53.687
even though it's, you know,
a little bit horse shit.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.656
Well, it is the, like,
DIY challenge.

05:56.656 --> 05:59.659
I'm really happy
with what I did.

05:59.659 --> 06:01.194
You should be.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.697
From head to toe, it, like,
is very cohesive for sure.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.900
When I first saw it,
I was, like, oop.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.970
And then when you started
shaping things around the bodice

06:09.970 --> 06:12.606
and doing, you know,
your magic, I was like, okay,

06:12.606 --> 06:16.710
this looks like
a wearable piece.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.179
So that's when I was,
like, okay, this is sickening.

06:19.179 --> 06:20.580
-Thank you.
-For sure.

06:20.580 --> 06:23.149
I love the eighties, and I love,
like, a glam rock moment,

06:23.149 --> 06:25.118
so I was feeling
very Billy Idol.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.287
And, like, what
I wanted to do the most

06:27.287 --> 06:28.521
with this particular challenge

06:28.521 --> 06:30.924
is embrace the fact that
we weren't given fabric.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.026
I can follow a pattern
if I need to,

06:33.026 --> 06:34.594
but I felt like
for this challenge,

06:34.594 --> 06:37.163
it's just, like, what can you do
with shit that's not fabric?

06:37.163 --> 06:39.299
And I feel like I did that.

06:39.299 --> 06:40.834
But we're at the point

06:40.834 --> 06:43.103
where, like, if you're
not doing the best,

06:43.103 --> 06:45.805
you're not going to be
in the top anymore.

06:45.805 --> 06:48.708
Like, you have to,
like, absolutely kill it.

06:48.708 --> 06:51.544
I keep looking at
this rat-tail, bitch.

06:51.544 --> 06:52.679
I love it.

06:52.679 --> 06:54.314
Why are you shaming
my rat-tail?

06:54.314 --> 06:57.217
Why don't you show the children
your tail of rat?

06:57.217 --> 06:58.852
Y'all see that?

06:58.852 --> 07:01.021
That tail's what kept you
out of the top.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.789
That tail was your
saving grace, baby.

07:02.789 --> 07:04.224
That tail was either
the saving grace

07:04.224 --> 07:06.059
or what kept you
out the top three, girl.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.927
I don't know which one it is.
[all laugh]

07:07.927 --> 07:10.664
Rat-tails are fashion.
Get into it.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.967
-Oh, my God.
-Whoa!

07:13.967 --> 07:18.371
I'm in the bottom.
Whoo-hoo!

07:18.371 --> 07:23.043
All right, we already know
where you are, mouth almighty.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.644
But if you'd like to tell them,

07:24.644 --> 07:27.747
you have a 30-second max
to explain yourself.

07:27.747 --> 07:28.915
And ready, set, go!

07:28.915 --> 07:32.018
So they loved the top.
They hated the hat.

07:32.018 --> 07:33.386
They did not like it.
They didn't want it.

07:33.386 --> 07:34.387
They were, like, too much.

07:34.387 --> 07:36.056
Too many accoutrements.

07:36.056 --> 07:38.124
Yeah, too many accoutrements,
exactly.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.659
I feel like you've
been waiting to perform

07:39.659 --> 07:41.995
and give them something,
so that's the opportunity.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.697
Okay, Jorgeous?

07:43.697 --> 07:44.964
I was really gagged,
because, bitch,

07:44.964 --> 07:46.032
I thought they were gonna

07:46.032 --> 07:48.234
fucking roast and toast
my ass to filth.

07:48.234 --> 07:51.471
But they really did
like my outfit.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.472
She's in the top.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.807
-Redemption.
-Thank God.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.775
Yeah, they said
that you redeemed yourself.

07:55.775 --> 07:58.111
I redeemed myself.
[applause]

07:58.111 --> 07:59.412
That's a big target.

07:59.412 --> 08:00.980
Angie?

08:00.980 --> 08:02.382
They loved it.

08:02.382 --> 08:03.950
-[laughs]
-They did? Yes!

08:03.950 --> 08:06.586
Classy, baby.
You wowed me.

08:06.586 --> 08:08.755
I think
I put on the card "Wow."

08:08.755 --> 08:11.758
I could see that
on any red carpet anywhere.

08:11.758 --> 08:13.059
That means a lot,

08:13.059 --> 08:15.462
because I'm a huge Taraji
fangirl, so it's okay.

08:15.462 --> 08:17.597
That's a moment, okay.

08:17.597 --> 08:18.898
But, no, I feel good.

08:18.898 --> 08:20.834
All right, Miss Maddy,
then break it down.

08:20.834 --> 08:21.968
What'd they have to say?

08:23.136 --> 08:25.372
They said it's one of
the most amazing things

08:25.372 --> 08:27.540
that has ever graced
RuPaul's Drag Race.

08:30.577 --> 08:32.445
And then I woke up
to reality.

08:32.445 --> 08:34.381
[all laugh]

08:34.381 --> 08:35.782
You bitch.

08:35.782 --> 08:36.916
They hated it.
They didn't like it.

08:36.916 --> 08:38.084
They didn't get it,

08:38.084 --> 08:41.354
and if there is a 100%
in the bottom, it's me.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.289
And I think the other person
is definitely Jasmine.

08:43.289 --> 08:44.724
Yeah, without a question.

08:44.724 --> 08:46.926
I think I just, like--I just
gotta focus on the lip sync.

08:46.926 --> 08:48.328
I've already sent
one bitch home,

08:48.328 --> 08:50.797
so now I just gotta focus
on sending Jasmine home, so...

08:50.797 --> 08:51.831
All right.

08:51.831 --> 08:52.966
I'm gonna go in
with the same attitude

08:52.966 --> 08:54.067
I had with the first lip sync.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.435
Like, I know what I do,

08:55.435 --> 08:57.670
I know my drag,
I know what I present.

08:57.670 --> 08:59.139
I am not going home tonight.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.540
Anything else?

09:01.908 --> 09:04.177
So basically what you're saying
is you about to slay her.

09:04.177 --> 09:05.912
[all laugh]

09:05.912 --> 09:08.014
No, no. No, I'm not--

09:08.014 --> 09:10.116
Feel it.
No, no, no, feel it.

09:10.116 --> 09:11.551
No, I want you to feel that.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.552
No, I was gonna say--

09:12.552 --> 09:13.953
I want you to feel that.

09:13.953 --> 09:15.955
I want you to feel as confident
as you feel right now.

09:15.955 --> 09:17.824
I'm not going
into this competition--

09:17.824 --> 09:20.093
I'm not gonna slay her,
I'm gonna slay the lip sync.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.728
I hope you do amazing.

09:21.728 --> 09:22.896
You, too, girl.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.298
I mean, I hope you go off.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.967
I hope you give the second-best
lip sync of the night.

09:27.967 --> 09:29.335
Because, like, I'm gonna
do what I do what--

09:29.335 --> 09:31.304
Why, you think you're gonna
be the first? Good luck.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.773
I'm gonna do, like,
what I have already done

09:33.773 --> 09:35.074
to send somebody else home.

09:35.074 --> 09:36.075
You are not there.

09:36.075 --> 09:37.243
It is my runway,
it is my lip sync,

09:37.243 --> 09:39.179
and I'm staying
in this fucking competition.

09:39.179 --> 09:40.847
Good luck.

09:40.847 --> 09:42.582
I'm not going home tonight.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.217
He's here, he's not queer,
he's not going nowhere.

09:44.217 --> 09:47.420
Yeah, I'm here, I'm not queer,
get used to it.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.722
Like, in this lip sync,
I'm just gonna do me,

09:49.722 --> 09:52.158
and show them why
I should still be here.

09:52.158 --> 09:53.193
I've already done it once.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.561
I feel like
I'm gonna do it again.

09:54.561 --> 09:56.863
All tea. I'm not worried
about this lip sync.

09:56.863 --> 09:59.232
I do this on a daily basis
in New York City.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.934
This is my bread and butter.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.269
So, like, I'm not going in
with the mindset of, like,

10:03.269 --> 10:05.338
worrying about Maddy or, like,
worrying about anybody else.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.373
-You should.
-I'm worrying about myself.

10:07.373 --> 10:10.910
I should? About what?
All tea, girl. [laughs]

10:10.910 --> 10:12.178
What the fuck
is she talking about?

10:12.178 --> 10:14.681
She thinks because
she's from New York

10:14.681 --> 10:16.216
and she does this,

10:16.216 --> 10:17.550
she lives, eats,
breathes drag,

10:17.550 --> 10:21.120
that her drag is better
than everyone else's.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.323
We're both in the bottom
right now.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.158
Bitch, you're
in the bottom, too.

10:25.158 --> 10:26.893
What do you mean,
why is she worrying about me?

10:26.893 --> 10:28.194
You're in the bottom as well.

10:28.194 --> 10:29.596
Yeah, I'm not worried
about you, though, girl,

10:29.596 --> 10:31.631
because what I'm selling
is not what you're selling.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.099
That is the tea, okay?

10:33.099 --> 10:34.100
Oh, okay.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.402
It just feels so disrespectful

10:36.402 --> 10:39.973
that Jasmine really doesn't
think I'm competition to her.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.107
I'm going to destroy you
in this lip sync.

10:41.107 --> 10:43.376
-It's not a problem.
-Okay.

10:43.376 --> 10:44.944
And if you wanna sit there
and feel that way, that's fine.

10:44.944 --> 10:47.580
I'll just watch you scurry along
and sashay away.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.649
Have your moment.
Keep talking.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.950
You're talking a lot more
than me, you know, because--

10:50.950 --> 10:53.920
-Well, that's a change.
-Yes, it is.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.623
This is your moment.
Have it!

10:56.623 --> 10:59.792
Go on.
The stage is here, please!

10:59.792 --> 11:02.562
[all laugh]
Please!

11:02.562 --> 11:04.097
I'm not worried about you.

11:04.097 --> 11:06.999
Like, I'm gonna do
the drag that I do.

11:06.999 --> 11:08.768
And the fact that you think,
like, you're from New York

11:08.768 --> 11:10.103
and you have all this whatever,

11:10.103 --> 11:11.671
like, that is not enough
to save you.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.640
Like, this lip sync song,
it is not a dancing song--

11:13.640 --> 11:16.509
Mama, that outfit's not enough
to save you, but, okay.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.812
Your outfit was not enough
to save you, either.

11:19.812 --> 11:21.080
You are in the bottom
as well.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.515
Girl, they liked everything
from the waist up.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.617
They didn't like anything
about yours, so keep talking.

11:24.617 --> 11:26.252
We are both in the same
position tonight,

11:26.252 --> 11:28.454
and for you to tell me
that, like--

11:28.454 --> 11:30.023
But I haven't been in the bottom
as much as you.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.457
But you're in the bottom now.

11:31.457 --> 11:33.326
But, girl, track record.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.962
All I am saying is this
is my first time in the bottom.

11:35.962 --> 11:38.498
I am not as stressed
as you are right now,

11:38.498 --> 11:40.166
who has been
in the bottom before.

11:40.166 --> 11:42.201
So my mindset is different
from your mindset,

11:42.201 --> 11:44.637
and you need to take that,
sit your fucking cocktail down,

11:44.637 --> 11:46.205
and have a moment with yourself

11:46.205 --> 11:47.774
before you get into
this fucking lip sync,

11:47.774 --> 11:50.977
because I am not worried
at all, period.

11:50.977 --> 11:51.978
Okay.

11:51.978 --> 11:53.613
Thank you. Next.

11:54.747 --> 11:56.382
Ugh.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.951
I love drag.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.185
I'm sorry we had to scream
at each other.

11:59.185 --> 12:01.087
No, don't be sorry, girl.
It's your feelings.

12:01.087 --> 12:02.488
I'm gonna go get ready
for this lip sync.

12:02.488 --> 12:03.656
I hope you do, too.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.527
Maddy, no. I don't want
your hug right now.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.662
I don't need it. No.

12:09.662 --> 12:10.797
Girl, don't.

12:10.797 --> 12:12.966
Girl, take the damn hug, bitch.
Where you going?

12:12.966 --> 12:14.667
I don't want any hard feelings.

12:14.667 --> 12:15.635
It's not hard feelings, though.

12:15.635 --> 12:16.803
Like, I am not that type of girl

12:16.803 --> 12:18.037
that, like, needs a hug
after, like, a moment.

12:18.037 --> 12:20.106
Oh, my God.

12:20.106 --> 12:21.874
Ladies, hi, queens!

12:21.874 --> 12:23.176
[all scream]

12:23.176 --> 12:26.479
Oh, my God!

12:30.750 --> 12:32.885
Child,
you just missed it, girl.

12:32.885 --> 12:34.387
-What'd I miss?
-Girl--

12:34.387 --> 12:35.488
What happened? Tell me!

12:35.488 --> 12:37.323
Girl, we had
an Empire moment, bitch.

12:37.323 --> 12:38.858
What was it about?

12:38.858 --> 12:41.995
It was just a lot of stress
and us, like,

12:41.995 --> 12:43.896
we're both in the bottom,
we already know it.

12:43.896 --> 12:46.366
But you know this is just
a learning experience.

12:46.366 --> 12:49.535
This is not the last drag show
ever in life.

12:49.535 --> 12:53.106
This is a part of your journey,
and you embrace it all.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.808
And I don't see
any losers here, at all.

12:55.808 --> 12:57.210
Because guess what?
You made it here.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.645
You lasted this long.

12:58.645 --> 13:01.614
Those are wins.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.851
I remember when I didn't get
accepted into theater school,

13:04.851 --> 13:07.520
and I honestly thought

13:07.520 --> 13:11.224
that meant I wasn't
gonna be an actor.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.792
Well, what if I stuck to that?

13:12.792 --> 13:15.595
What if I tucked my tail
and went away

13:15.595 --> 13:16.896
and was, like, "I'm a loser?"

13:16.896 --> 13:19.365
The way that I knuckled up

13:19.365 --> 13:21.768
and found my way
back to the arts

13:21.768 --> 13:25.805
is why I've lasted so long
in Hollywood, I think.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.374
Because a lot of the kids
that did go to that school...

13:28.374 --> 13:32.412
[all laugh]

13:35.415 --> 13:36.482
They're not still doing it.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.017
Do you see what I'm saying?

13:38.017 --> 13:40.286
You know, I know Shangela.

13:40.286 --> 13:45.024
Halleloo. And if you can
recall, she didn't win.

13:45.024 --> 13:46.592
And then Ru brought her back.

13:46.592 --> 13:47.860
Look at the positives.

13:47.860 --> 13:49.328
Don't think just
because a door is closed

13:49.328 --> 13:52.265
or you've been told a no
that that's a negative.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.200
That could be
the blessing in disguise.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.368
-Period.
-Yeah.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.070
But I love to be told no.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.072
-Yeah!
-[laughs]

13:59.072 --> 14:01.307
I've been there so many times,
and look at me now.

14:01.307 --> 14:04.477
I'm a living testimony.

14:04.477 --> 14:06.612
Noes put me where I am today.

14:06.612 --> 14:08.715
This is just a part
of your journey.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.383
It doesn't mean it is over.

14:10.383 --> 14:13.920
It's propelling you
to your greatness.

14:13.920 --> 14:17.423
That's exactly what
this whole moment is about.

14:17.423 --> 14:19.158
Yes, thank you.

14:19.158 --> 14:21.394
Sorry to interrupt.
It is time to head on back.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.696
-Thank you!
-You look gorgeous!

14:23.696 --> 14:27.033
Yes! Thank you so much, ladies.
Y'all kill tonight, okay?

14:27.033 --> 14:28.801
Oh, my God.

14:28.801 --> 14:31.237
-I love you.
-I love you more.

14:31.237 --> 14:32.839
-[laughs]
-Oh, my God.

14:32.839 --> 14:34.273
That was awesome.

14:34.273 --> 14:37.543
That was really, really,
like, beautiful advice.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.846
Thank you,
RuPaul's Drag Race!

14:42.014 --> 14:44.117
The fight that I just had
with Maddy,

14:44.117 --> 14:46.452
I'm ready to show this bitch
that she is not staying,

14:46.452 --> 14:48.955
and it is because of me
that she is not staying.

14:48.955 --> 14:50.189
At the end of the day, girl,

14:50.189 --> 14:51.824
this is a lip sync
for your life,

14:51.824 --> 14:53.993
and I've been wanting
to prove to the judges

14:53.993 --> 14:58.865
why I am in this competition,
and I am ready to do so.

14:58.865 --> 15:00.299
I know anything could happen,

15:00.299 --> 15:02.435
but right now I'm not thinking
about going home,

15:02.435 --> 15:03.669
I'm not thinking about
the competition,

15:03.669 --> 15:05.204
I'm not thinking
about Jasmine.

15:05.204 --> 15:07.874
The only thing I'm thinking
about is what I'm gonna do.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.275
This is my moment.

15:09.275 --> 15:11.110
I am not going home right now.

15:11.110 --> 15:12.612
Let's get to work.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.180
Ladies, it's time
for the main stage.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.882
Come on out.

15:15.882 --> 15:17.450
-Oh, oh, time to go!
-Whoo, okay.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.886
Come on out, ladies.

15:19.886 --> 15:21.954
Maddy? Just a minute.

15:21.954 --> 15:23.523
I love you so very much.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.324
So happy I got to know you
and meet you.

15:25.324 --> 15:26.726
You say it like I'm leaving.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.261
-No. [laughs]
-Right.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.595
Treat you like you leaving.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.898
No! I ain't goin' nowhere.

15:31.898 --> 15:33.766
RuPaul:
Welcome back, ladies.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.902
I've made some decisions.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.371
Welcome back, ladies.

15:38.371 --> 15:39.906
I've made some decisions.

15:39.906 --> 15:43.009
Maddy, Jasmine,

15:43.009 --> 15:44.577
the time has come

15:44.577 --> 15:46.345
for you to lip sync

15:46.345 --> 15:49.849
for your life!

15:54.687 --> 15:58.758
Jasmine Kennedie,
shantay you stay.

15:58.758 --> 16:02.695
Maddy Morphosis, sashay away.

16:02.695 --> 16:05.131
[applause]

16:05.131 --> 16:07.967
Maddy! We love you, Maddy!

16:11.871 --> 16:15.775
I am on a roller coaster
of emotions right now,

16:15.775 --> 16:20.613
and I'm so upset with myself
because I know I can do more,

16:20.613 --> 16:25.184
and I don't want this to be,
like, the end of my journey.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.724
[sighs]

16:35.061 --> 16:36.696
Oh, there's notes.

16:36.696 --> 16:40.132
"Mr. Maddy,
you obviously slayed today

16:40.132 --> 16:41.834
"and really got to connect
with us today.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.003
"I really enjoyed
getting to know you.

16:44.003 --> 16:47.273
"You are Miss Untucked,

16:47.273 --> 16:48.441
Miss Kerri Colby."

16:48.441 --> 16:50.042
I guess it is what it is.

16:50.042 --> 16:53.312
"My sister Maddy, I adore you
more than you will know.

16:53.312 --> 16:55.381
"You have left your mark
on the world,

16:55.381 --> 16:58.818
and the world will fall in love
with you, love, DeJa."

17:01.220 --> 17:04.357
Girl, I can't read what
the fuck she wrote here.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.359
It says, "Leave me
along--alone--"

17:07.560 --> 17:09.128
She says she'll love me.

17:09.128 --> 17:10.897
That much I can deduce.

17:10.897 --> 17:15.401
I am so happy that I got
to experience something

17:15.401 --> 17:19.138
that so few people get
to experience in their life.

17:19.138 --> 17:20.539
Where I came from,
I never thought

17:20.539 --> 17:23.476
I would go further west
than, like, Oklahoma,

17:23.476 --> 17:24.977
so the fact that, like,
I've made it this far,

17:24.977 --> 17:26.879
I'm over the moon.

17:26.879 --> 17:29.815
Disappointed,
but over the moon.

17:31.651 --> 17:34.120
Coming into this competition,
I had this whole idea of, like,

17:34.120 --> 17:36.622
what I was and my drag persona.

17:36.622 --> 17:38.591
But I feel like
I've learned more,

17:38.591 --> 17:41.260
like, about myself and drag,

17:41.260 --> 17:44.397
and what Maddy Morphosis
is to me.

17:44.397 --> 17:49.435
Being the first openly
straight queen on Drag Race,

17:49.435 --> 17:50.870
I had this, like, pressure
of, like,

17:50.870 --> 17:53.773
what is, like, a heterosexual
queen gonna do on this show?

17:53.773 --> 17:56.108
But at the same time,
I know that, like,

17:56.108 --> 17:58.577
I am not indicative
of the drag scene.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.379
I've never met
another straight queen.

18:00.379 --> 18:02.181
The drag that I do,

18:02.181 --> 18:05.484
it is indicative of me,
what I want to present.

18:05.484 --> 18:07.987
I just hope that
I have the opportunity

18:07.987 --> 18:10.389
to show other
straight guys out there

18:10.389 --> 18:11.857
watching the show
with their girlfriends

18:11.857 --> 18:13.859
not to take life so seriously.

18:13.859 --> 18:17.596
Be yourself, do you,
just live your life.

18:17.596 --> 18:19.832
Before coming into
this competition,

18:19.832 --> 18:21.901
I was just, like,
stocking vitamins at Target,

18:21.901 --> 18:23.402
so being able to show, like,

18:23.402 --> 18:25.504
what I can do
on such a huge scale,

18:25.504 --> 18:28.841
like, I know I can do
so much more past this.

18:30.509 --> 18:32.478
Goodbye, RuPaul's Drag Race.

18:32.478 --> 18:35.381
Goodbye, America.

18:35.381 --> 18:39.118
It's not really goodbye.
Till next time.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.953
Thank you so much.

18:43.322 --> 18:45.958
I'm looking forward
to just getting home,

18:45.958 --> 18:47.827
spend some time
with my girlfriend

18:47.827 --> 18:50.196
and just snuggling
with my cats.

18:50.196 --> 18:51.831
I'm ready to see Pickles again.

18:51.831 --> 18:54.300
I need my little man
back in my life.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.535
But I'm also looking forward
to getting a chance

18:56.535 --> 18:59.005
to, like, travel the world,
see different places,

18:59.005 --> 19:01.173
and really get
to experience life

19:01.173 --> 19:05.778
through this medium
that has so many possibilities.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.780
Today RuPaul's Drag Race,

19:07.780 --> 19:09.982
tomorrow, Arkansas,

19:09.982 --> 19:12.018
next week...

19:12.018 --> 19:14.387
the world.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.022
Thank you, guys.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.324
