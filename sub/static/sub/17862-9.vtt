00:02.956 --> 00:05.795
As soon as she goes into labour,
you're induced.

00:05.796 --> 00:07.875
Discretion bought, and you emerge

00:07.876 --> 00:10.875
with a bonny bouncing babe
in your arms.

00:10.876 --> 00:13.555
Don't make me ask, please.

00:13.556 --> 00:16.196
Jack? He is your father.

00:18.356 --> 00:20.115
And this new man is, what,

00:20.116 --> 00:22.195
some misguided attempt
to make George jealous?

00:22.196 --> 00:25.556
I'll be appealing to a far more
potent emotion than that.

00:26.716 --> 00:28.395
Regina's back.

00:28.396 --> 00:30.435
They say your husband's alive.

00:30.436 --> 00:32.195
You bring him home.

00:32.195 --> 00:34.196
I love you.

00:35.196 --> 00:36.716
I always will.

00:44.054 --> 00:45.925
I'm here Rene.

01:27.479 --> 01:29.279
Missy!

01:31.719 --> 01:33.358
Welcome home, stranger.

01:33.359 --> 01:35.639
I've only been gone six weeks.

01:45.959 --> 01:48.038
Careful, my darling.

01:48.039 --> 01:50.238
That's it.

01:50.239 --> 01:51.719
There we are.

01:53.319 --> 01:55.198
Dr Rene Nordmann,

01:55.199 --> 01:57.758
Dr Jack Duncan, Mr Roy Briggs.

01:57.759 --> 01:59.678
Pleased to meet you.

01:59.679 --> 02:01.198
And just call me Roy.

02:01.199 --> 02:02.998
Bonjour, mate.

02:02.999 --> 02:04.478
Hello.

02:04.479 --> 02:07.878
Oh, you speak English! That's good,
'cause that's all the French I got.

02:07.879 --> 02:10.078
I'll get the bags.

02:10.079 --> 02:11.918
Thank you.

02:11.919 --> 02:15.638
Looks like you could do with
a lie-down. And a check-up.

02:15.639 --> 02:18.718
Come on.

02:18.719 --> 02:20.318
Your blood pressure's low,

02:20.319 --> 02:22.878
but fluids and rest
should see you right.

02:22.879 --> 02:25.118
It's a long journey.
Thanks for having this ready.

02:25.119 --> 02:27.158
Three days on the move,
I guessed you'd need it.

02:27.159 --> 02:29.478
Merci.

02:29.479 --> 02:31.038
No worries.

02:31.039 --> 02:34.079
So you'll stay in overnight
and then I'll take you to Roy's.

02:37.039 --> 02:38.559
Rene...

02:39.639 --> 02:41.639
Darling...

02:54.999 --> 02:58.958
I've translated his hospital records
and I have his latest X-rays.

02:58.959 --> 03:00.999
You need to see them.

03:03.079 --> 03:06.238
To remove these fragments
would be incredibly dangerous.

03:06.239 --> 03:10.638
Sometimes he's present
for minutes at a time.

03:10.639 --> 03:12.118
And then he drifts again.

03:12.119 --> 03:14.598
He doesn't know about this?
No.

03:14.599 --> 03:16.398
I spoke with his doctor in private.

03:16.399 --> 03:18.559
Well, it's a miracle
he's here at all.

03:21.919 --> 03:24.838
The doctor was honest
about the risk to his life.

03:24.839 --> 03:27.838
Yes. With the damage to his brain,
he could haemorrhage at any moment.

03:27.839 --> 03:29.438
The uncertainty must make it hard.

03:29.439 --> 03:31.878
I'm thankful for every moment,

03:31.879 --> 03:33.999
whether it's a day or a lifetime.

03:35.839 --> 03:41.478
So... you and Carolyn?

03:41.479 --> 03:43.758
Wonderful.
Good.

03:43.759 --> 03:46.518
And George?

03:46.519 --> 03:48.718
Four posts down!
How could you NOT notice?

03:48.719 --> 03:50.318
Could have lost
a whole mob through there.

03:50.319 --> 03:52.118
I'll get the men onto it.

03:52.119 --> 03:54.878
I'm sorry. I haven't been sleeping.
None of us have.

03:54.879 --> 03:57.838
I know, and we'd have moved into
the cottage if Aunt Caro wasn't there.

03:57.839 --> 03:59.678
It's not that.

03:59.679 --> 04:02.198
It's not Georgie.

04:02.199 --> 04:04.118
Oh, it is for us.

04:04.119 --> 04:06.678
This is one of the most
precious times of your life.

04:06.679 --> 04:11.079
Enjoy it, despite the lack of sleep.

04:13.079 --> 04:14.638
Hey...

04:14.639 --> 04:17.439
Let me try.

04:19.719 --> 04:21.238
Oh, yes.

04:21.238 --> 04:22.998
It's alright.

04:22.999 --> 04:25.958
I've tried everything.

04:25.959 --> 04:30.838
Fresh air, brandy,
laying him on his back...

04:30.839 --> 04:33.478
If I may offer
a little well-meaning advice,

04:33.479 --> 04:36.798
sometimes the trick is
not to do anything at all.

04:36.799 --> 04:39.718
And there's no harm
in a little benign neglect.

04:39.719 --> 04:43.279
I can't simply leave him.
Just give it a try.

04:44.999 --> 04:47.758
He needs to know I love him.

04:47.759 --> 04:50.278
Oh, Olivia, he does know.

04:50.279 --> 04:53.558
Aww.

04:53.559 --> 04:57.798
Why won't he do that for me?

04:57.799 --> 04:59.798
His namesake was a grumbler too.

04:59.799 --> 05:02.399
And James. It runs in the family.

05:04.759 --> 05:06.838
Yes!

05:06.839 --> 05:09.078
Thank you.

05:09.079 --> 05:10.998
Thank you.

05:10.999 --> 05:13.399
This little boy's so precious to me.

05:14.599 --> 05:16.559
I'll put him down.

05:20.639 --> 05:22.478
It's alright.

05:22.479 --> 05:25.398
No, no, no, no...

05:25.399 --> 05:28.038
Shh! Oh, why can't I do this?

05:28.039 --> 05:31.598
Don't fret. He can sense
that you're anxious. It's alright.

05:31.599 --> 05:33.078
Yes?

05:33.079 --> 05:35.558
Excuse me, ma'am.
Mr Swanson is here.

05:35.559 --> 05:36.718
Oh, right.

05:36.719 --> 05:38.558
For you, miss.

05:38.559 --> 05:41.318
I'll be down in a moment.
Thank you, Colleen.

05:41.319 --> 05:44.198
Three visits in as many weeks.

05:44.199 --> 05:46.719
Would you mind?
Oh, not at all.

06:44.279 --> 06:46.398
He's always upset.

06:46.399 --> 06:50.558
He just cries constantly.

06:50.559 --> 06:53.118
I think he knows
I'm not his real mother.

06:53.119 --> 06:55.278
That sounds ridiculous.

06:55.279 --> 06:59.038
No. It sounds like something
someone lacking sleep would say.

06:59.039 --> 07:01.839
And someone bearing
a load of secrecy.

07:03.239 --> 07:06.159
You make me seem like a Russian spy.

07:07.439 --> 07:09.358
Only it's worse, I suppose.

07:09.359 --> 07:12.558
'Cause I'm deceiving
the people I love.

07:12.559 --> 07:13.958
I know how hard it must be.

07:13.959 --> 07:16.158
That's why I visit.

07:16.159 --> 07:19.238
Thank heavens you do.

07:19.239 --> 07:23.078
I've really come to
rely on your friendship.

07:23.079 --> 07:24.758
And I yours.

07:24.759 --> 07:28.599
I got you into this.
The least I can do is support you.

07:31.479 --> 07:34.318
James is so happy.

07:34.319 --> 07:36.919
It makes the whole thing bearable.

07:40.239 --> 07:41.879
Hello, old man!

07:46.599 --> 07:50.359
Andrew, I think I'd go mad
if I didn't have you to be honest with.

08:02.359 --> 08:05.158
Ooh, another wedding gift?
From Mrs Swanson.

08:05.159 --> 08:06.798
I'll put it with the others.

08:06.799 --> 08:09.438
Would you tell Mr Swanson
I'd like to see him before he leaves?

08:09.439 --> 08:10.919
Yes, ma'am.

08:12.079 --> 08:13.559
Hmm.

08:16.119 --> 08:18.998
Hey, Lucky, it's good
to see you too!

08:18.999 --> 08:21.558
That mutt hasn't even got
the makings of a poker face.

08:21.559 --> 08:23.238
Unlike you.

08:23.239 --> 08:24.799
I don't want you
getting carried away.

08:27.439 --> 08:29.158
Good to be back?

08:29.159 --> 08:30.638
Home.

08:30.639 --> 08:32.639
For as long as you
and your hubby need it.

08:37.679 --> 08:39.518
Might have been better
if we'd stopped the truck

08:39.519 --> 08:40.998
and got that over and done with.

08:40.999 --> 08:43.998
How we meet has to be
of his choosing.

08:43.999 --> 08:46.519
I owe him that at least.

08:47.839 --> 08:50.239
Not gonna be easy for either of you.

09:01.039 --> 09:02.998
You summon, I obey.

09:02.999 --> 09:04.478
I didn't want you slipping away again

09:04.479 --> 09:06.319
before I had the chance
to say thank you.

09:07.479 --> 09:10.758
For being so solicitous
towards Olivia of late.

09:10.759 --> 09:12.478
I've done what anyone would.

09:12.479 --> 09:14.038
Above and beyond.

09:14.039 --> 09:16.918
The baby's sudden arrival
had quite an effect on me.

09:16.919 --> 09:19.238
It brought us close.

09:19.239 --> 09:22.798
Well, both you and Olivia may
understand this 'special connection',

09:22.799 --> 09:24.518
but the world may not.

09:24.519 --> 09:26.798
A married woman and a known roue!

09:26.799 --> 09:28.998
I care naught for the world.

09:28.999 --> 09:30.759
Nor for her reputation.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.198
I'll see you at the christening.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.438
You're coming?

09:36.439 --> 09:38.479
I wouldn't miss it.

10:40.559 --> 10:42.278
I have a message for Anna.

10:42.279 --> 10:44.398
She's in Sydney.
I heard.

10:44.399 --> 10:48.558
Tell her, from me,
it's all her fault.

10:48.559 --> 10:52.319
What is?
She'll know. When it happens.

10:54.719 --> 10:56.999
Families are such an Achilles heel.

10:58.919 --> 11:00.599
You can't hurt us.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.719
Not directly.

11:09.839 --> 11:12.879
I give Mr and Mrs Dago a year.

11:35.999 --> 11:37.719
She'll see.

11:54.744 --> 11:56.663
George!

11:56.664 --> 11:58.543
Very nice to see you.

11:58.544 --> 12:00.583
And you.

12:00.584 --> 12:02.377
I thought it best
not to be at the station.

12:02.378 --> 12:03.577
Of course.

12:03.578 --> 12:06.057
But I didn't want our first meeting
to be at the wedding.

12:06.058 --> 12:08.459
I wouldn't have missed
her special day for the world.

12:08.470 --> 12:10.349
None of the family know
you've returned.

12:10.350 --> 12:12.429
Less chance of them
letting it slip to Anna.

12:12.430 --> 12:14.589
A surprise for
the whole family, then!

12:14.590 --> 12:16.669
Anna will be thrilled.

12:16.670 --> 12:20.229
Everyone will be thrilled, uh...

12:20.230 --> 12:23.910
The tickets home...
Don't mention it.

12:27.510 --> 12:29.029
Your husband?

12:29.030 --> 12:30.629
Rene's at the hospital.

12:30.630 --> 12:33.070
Nothing serious?
It's the journey. He'll be fine.

12:35.950 --> 12:38.430
I look forward to meeting him.
As he does you.

12:40.390 --> 12:42.390
I told him all about us.

12:47.270 --> 12:49.269
I'll let you settle in.

12:49.270 --> 12:50.830
See you at the wedding.

13:08.150 --> 13:10.469
Yes?

13:10.470 --> 13:12.790
May I?

13:17.190 --> 13:19.909
Take a seat.
No, I won't stay.

13:19.910 --> 13:21.629
Thank you for meeting them.

13:21.630 --> 13:23.110
Oh, my pleasure.

13:24.630 --> 13:26.789
She seems glad to be back.

13:26.790 --> 13:29.149
She does.

13:29.150 --> 13:30.789
I paid her a visit.

13:30.790 --> 13:32.390
Right.

13:34.510 --> 13:37.469
She mentioned her husband is here.
Yeah.

13:37.470 --> 13:39.549
Nothing to be concerned about,
I hope?

13:39.550 --> 13:41.869
Uh, I'm not really at liberty to...

13:41.870 --> 13:43.470
Of course, of course.

13:44.750 --> 13:48.110
Apart from the wedding, I think it's
best Sarah and I avoid each other.

13:49.390 --> 13:50.949
Well, whatever you reckon.

13:50.950 --> 13:54.869
So, uh... I'd appreciate it
if you could let me know if she...

13:54.870 --> 13:58.109
..if THEY need any
financial assistance.

13:58.110 --> 14:00.309
Yeah, will do.

14:00.310 --> 14:02.390
We needn't discuss them again.

14:04.070 --> 14:05.750
George.

14:08.270 --> 14:09.789
Your mother.

14:09.790 --> 14:11.670
Best not discussed either.

14:16.270 --> 14:18.829
Once you've finished filing,
could you check on Dr Nordmann?

14:18.830 --> 14:20.310
He's in the private ward.

14:58.710 --> 15:00.789
Dr Nordmann.

15:00.790 --> 15:03.030
Welcome. George Bligh.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.669
Thank you.

15:07.670 --> 15:09.990
Tres genereux.

15:11.950 --> 15:14.629
I look forward to seeing you
at my daughter's wedding.

15:14.630 --> 15:16.629
Anna.

15:16.630 --> 15:17.829
Yes.

15:17.830 --> 15:19.430
Oui.

15:26.710 --> 15:28.390
Dr Nordmann?

15:29.950 --> 15:31.550
M-Mr Bligh.

15:36.950 --> 15:38.430
Merci.

15:43.070 --> 15:45.310
Dr Nordmann?

16:02.310 --> 16:03.830
Monsieur Bligh?

16:11.190 --> 16:14.189
It certainly isn't light!

16:14.190 --> 16:16.150
But it certainly is beautiful.

16:17.230 --> 16:19.269
Oh, no, you don't!

16:19.270 --> 16:21.469
A Rocher deserves
better treatment than that!

16:21.470 --> 16:25.910
Oops! I'm not a very good bride,
am I?

16:27.430 --> 16:29.109
That's why I'm here.

16:29.110 --> 16:34.349
I'm sorry, I just wish...
I know it's not possible.

16:34.350 --> 16:36.309
Father's lost enough as it is.

16:36.310 --> 16:39.469
But the closer it gets,
the more I think about Jack,

16:39.470 --> 16:41.349
sitting there like
just another guest.

16:41.350 --> 16:42.829
He understands.

16:42.830 --> 16:45.230
He's missed so many
of my special moments.

16:46.430 --> 16:48.709
I wish they could both
give me away.

16:48.710 --> 16:50.429
That's a lovely thought.

16:50.430 --> 16:52.989
Jack doesn't feel
any less loved.

16:52.990 --> 16:55.510
And this way, neither does George.

17:13.430 --> 17:14.989
Excuse me, George.

17:14.990 --> 17:17.989
Andrew Swanson was here again today.

17:17.990 --> 17:21.069
I'm concerned that
his constant visits to Olivia

17:21.069 --> 17:22.868
are a source of upset for James.

17:22.869 --> 17:25.709
Your incessant need to interfere.
No, that is precisely...

17:25.710 --> 17:27.310
I have enough to worry about!

17:29.350 --> 17:31.349
Well, you're still
head of this family.

17:31.350 --> 17:33.390
When it suits you.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.349
Sarah's back.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.629
When?

17:41.630 --> 17:43.469
Today.

17:43.470 --> 17:45.429
We hope to surprise Anna
at the wedding,

17:45.430 --> 17:48.069
so if you could be discreet
with the knowledge.

17:48.070 --> 17:49.870
You expected her?

17:52.510 --> 17:53.990
Is she alone?

17:55.190 --> 17:56.669
No.

17:56.670 --> 17:57.949
Oh, George...

17:57.950 --> 17:59.709
Don't.

17:59.710 --> 18:02.789
Mrs Nordmann and I are getting on
with our separate lives.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.590
I suggest we do the same.

18:16.790 --> 18:18.629
It's a bit early for that, isn't it?

18:18.630 --> 18:20.670
I figured you might still be
on Frog time.

18:33.310 --> 18:35.949
You know, we've never had to do
too much talking, you and I.

18:35.950 --> 18:38.829
But if talking's gonna help...

18:38.830 --> 18:40.590
Thank you.

18:45.630 --> 18:47.549
Oh, I've missed this.

18:47.550 --> 18:50.470
Me too.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.550
I might swap this for tea.

19:09.230 --> 19:10.909
I feel a sense of deja vu.

19:10.910 --> 19:14.709
Mmm, we struck our three-month
bargain the last time you came.

19:14.710 --> 19:17.710
I'm more recalling
the first day at the cottage.

19:19.150 --> 19:20.749
I've misjudged you.

19:20.750 --> 19:22.229
Frequently.

19:22.230 --> 19:23.709
You have.

19:23.710 --> 19:25.190
I hope never to do so again.

19:27.070 --> 19:28.989
I have wronged you.

19:28.990 --> 19:31.269
You reunited me with my husband.

19:31.270 --> 19:33.350
Not intentionally.
Nevertheless.

19:34.990 --> 19:37.349
I won't assume any possibility
of intimacy,

19:37.350 --> 19:41.070
but I trust we do not
proceed as enemies.

19:42.030 --> 19:45.790
I've lost George and Anna.

19:46.830 --> 19:48.869
And the rest of the family
may follow.

19:48.870 --> 19:50.430
You don't deserve that.

19:52.790 --> 19:55.070
Well, that does make my request
a little easier.

19:58.830 --> 20:00.830
If you can help in any way...

20:02.750 --> 20:04.589
Not for me. For George.

20:04.590 --> 20:07.790
He's being eaten away by bitterness.

20:09.630 --> 20:11.150
I apologise.

20:14.310 --> 20:17.229
I will help, if I can.

20:17.230 --> 20:18.710
Thank you.

20:21.990 --> 20:25.469
I wish you and your husband
my very best.

20:25.470 --> 20:28.150
Oh, you'll see us at the wedding.

20:29.510 --> 20:31.150
I'm not invited.

21:10.150 --> 21:11.709
Yes?

21:11.710 --> 21:13.909
You awake?

21:13.910 --> 21:15.829
How could I sleep?

21:15.830 --> 21:18.909
There's someone
who wants to see you.

21:18.910 --> 21:21.149
Someone who's not supposed
to see you before the church.

21:21.150 --> 21:24.349
What?! What is he doing here?

21:24.350 --> 21:25.829
He knows this is bad luck.

21:25.830 --> 21:27.989
It will be if Mother catches you.

21:27.990 --> 21:29.670
Come here.

21:30.630 --> 21:32.390
Thank you.

21:33.350 --> 21:35.069
Sorry. I had to see you.

21:35.070 --> 21:37.149
Well, hear your voice.

21:37.150 --> 21:39.110
Why? Have you changed your mind?

21:40.070 --> 21:41.590
Never.

21:42.790 --> 21:44.269
I missed you so much.

21:44.270 --> 21:46.709
And after today, we will never
spend another night apart.

21:46.710 --> 21:48.230
No.

21:50.150 --> 21:53.189
Are you still worried about
Mr Bligh and Dr Jack?

21:53.190 --> 21:55.470
That's the only thing
I'd change if I could.

21:56.990 --> 21:59.589
What's wrong?
I can hear you thinking.

21:59.590 --> 22:02.190
Something happened
while you were away...

22:03.510 --> 22:04.989
..with Andrew Swanson.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.589
You saw him?

22:06.590 --> 22:08.470
Yeah, he came by the house.

22:11.630 --> 22:13.429
I lost my temper.

22:13.430 --> 22:15.509
If it has repercussions,
I'm really sorry.

22:15.510 --> 22:17.189
Gino. Gino, listen to me.

22:17.190 --> 22:19.709
No matter what happened
between you and Andrew,

22:19.710 --> 22:21.549
I'm sure he deserved it.

22:21.550 --> 22:24.549
He could make life difficult for us.

22:24.550 --> 22:27.310
No, he can't.
Because we have each other.

22:30.270 --> 22:32.069
Oh, boy.

22:32.070 --> 22:35.030
Now, go before Grandmother gets up.

22:36.910 --> 22:38.430
I love you.

22:49.554 --> 22:52.673
A Bligh marrying into
the Catholic faith!

22:52.674 --> 22:54.553
Who'd have thought we'd see the day?

22:54.554 --> 22:57.153
As long as they're happy.
Indeed, Alma, indeed.

22:57.154 --> 23:00.433
I'll take my place at the papist pew
and wish them all the best.

23:00.434 --> 23:03.633
Your mystery patient gone,
I see.

23:03.634 --> 23:05.553
Discharged last night.

23:05.554 --> 23:07.273
A foreigner, I hear?

23:07.274 --> 23:08.753
Was he not, Alma dear?

23:08.754 --> 23:10.673
Don't you have a wedding
to get ready for?

23:10.674 --> 23:12.433
Dr Duncan!

23:12.434 --> 23:14.233
I could say the same for you.

23:14.234 --> 23:16.593
Tying up a few loose ends
before I dash.

23:16.594 --> 23:19.073
As must I, for my salon appointment.

23:19.074 --> 23:20.993
You'll turn as many heads
as the bride.

23:20.994 --> 23:23.194
Oh, doctor!
Roy Briggs, at least.

23:24.194 --> 23:27.433
The likes of Roy Briggs
being invited to a Bligh wedding?

23:27.434 --> 23:29.153
Highly improbable, doctor.

23:29.154 --> 23:30.834
Highly improbable.

23:34.074 --> 23:36.593
Please, Georgie.

23:36.594 --> 23:38.913
You need to rest.

23:38.914 --> 23:43.233
I love you. I do.

23:43.234 --> 23:45.473
Please!

23:45.474 --> 23:47.554
Is everything alright?

23:48.634 --> 23:51.794
I was changing his nappy
and I poked him with a safety pin.

23:53.154 --> 23:56.033
I need him to settle
so I can get ready.

23:56.034 --> 23:58.954
It's alright. It's alright.

24:07.994 --> 24:10.673
Your parents sent
a gift for the wedding.

24:10.674 --> 24:12.553
How lovely.

24:12.554 --> 24:14.434
I put it downstairs with the others.

24:15.514 --> 24:17.593
Still think it's odd
Andrew Swanson sent one.

24:17.594 --> 24:19.073
Why?

24:19.074 --> 24:21.513
The way Anna treated him.

24:21.514 --> 24:24.114
You'd understand
if you knew him better.

24:26.474 --> 24:28.833
What is happening
between the two of you?

24:28.834 --> 24:30.874
Nothing.

24:36.674 --> 24:38.594
I'll take him.

24:46.314 --> 24:49.393
I don't like the degree of intimacy
he's assuming with you.

24:49.394 --> 24:52.993
He was at the hospital
when our son was born.

24:52.994 --> 24:54.633
Even before then.

24:54.634 --> 24:58.793
He doesn't even pretend
to be visiting the both of us.

24:58.794 --> 25:01.033
Do you blame him, with that attitude?

25:01.034 --> 25:03.113
I can't feign a liking I don't feel.

25:03.114 --> 25:06.993
He has been a good friend to me.
Men and women can't be friends.

25:06.994 --> 25:10.393
So I have to accept men can be lovers

25:10.394 --> 25:13.674
but you won't accept
a man and a woman as friends?

25:23.834 --> 25:25.314
We leave in an hour.

25:40.474 --> 25:44.033
Stop blinking!
I'm sorry.

25:44.034 --> 25:45.674
Yes?

25:46.834 --> 25:49.154
It's only the father of the bride.
Come in.

25:51.794 --> 25:54.513
Can I get you anything?
Just a husband.

25:54.514 --> 25:56.714
And some champagne!
I'll see what I can do.

25:57.834 --> 26:02.514
Well, you've made your romance
novels come true, haven't you?

26:05.954 --> 26:09.953
Anna, the anger I have towards
your grandmother is mine.

26:09.954 --> 26:12.673
You make your own choice about
whether or not she's there today.

26:12.674 --> 26:15.673
After what she did to you...
That's what I mean.

26:15.674 --> 26:18.753
I'll send her up.
Father...

26:18.754 --> 26:21.073
You won't walk down that aisle
today in peace

26:21.074 --> 26:23.474
unless you have this conversation,
regardless of the outcome.

26:24.474 --> 26:27.473
And I won't have you
looking back on this special day

26:27.474 --> 26:29.154
with any regrets.

26:32.354 --> 26:33.994
He's right.

26:37.114 --> 26:38.594
George.

26:45.074 --> 26:46.634
Thank you.

26:47.754 --> 26:49.993
Today is not a day for bitterness.

26:49.994 --> 26:51.593
Not for the bride.

26:51.594 --> 26:53.753
I haven't thanked you enough
over the years.

26:53.754 --> 26:55.994
You know there's no need.
There is.

26:58.074 --> 26:59.913
Thank you

26:59.914 --> 27:02.473
for everything that
you have done for her.

27:02.474 --> 27:05.073
She is a remarkable young woman

27:05.074 --> 27:07.873
because you are a wonderful man.

27:07.874 --> 27:10.154
It's an honour.

27:11.474 --> 27:14.153
And I'm glad we'll both be with her

27:14.154 --> 27:16.074
to share her happiness.

27:19.554 --> 27:21.754
I know today will be
difficult for you.

27:23.194 --> 27:25.994
Seems only yesterday
we were celebrating my engagement.

27:29.954 --> 27:31.794
Life goes on.

27:47.754 --> 27:49.874
You remember our wedding?

27:53.194 --> 27:55.394
I couldn't believe you were mine.

27:57.914 --> 27:59.553
Youse right?

27:59.554 --> 28:01.033
You're a lucky man, Rene.

28:01.034 --> 28:02.713
I'm the lucky one.

28:02.714 --> 28:04.833
Ready for your first
Aussie shindig, mate?

28:04.834 --> 28:07.514
Shindig?
We are.

28:14.274 --> 28:17.274
Is he settled?
For the moment.

28:18.834 --> 28:21.593
Perhaps we should leave him
with Colleen.

28:21.594 --> 28:24.153
It's his first public outing.
It's a big day.

28:24.154 --> 28:26.593
You should hold him, then,
if he gets upset.

28:26.594 --> 28:28.354
He's better with you.

28:33.434 --> 28:35.433
Will you sit for a minute?
We'll be late.

28:35.434 --> 28:36.914
Please.

28:42.634 --> 28:44.273
I know what's going on.

28:44.274 --> 28:47.274
What do you mean?

28:48.954 --> 28:51.394
Today's bringing back memories
of our own wedding.

28:54.034 --> 28:56.193
I want you to know

28:56.194 --> 28:58.913
if I wasn't truthful
when I said our vows then,

28:58.914 --> 29:03.554
if I said them now, I would be.

29:06.074 --> 29:07.954
I owe everything to you.

29:09.074 --> 29:10.554
My son.

29:12.754 --> 29:14.874
You both mean the world to me.

29:21.714 --> 29:23.514
You are my world.

29:41.634 --> 29:44.233
Mother? Mother!

29:44.234 --> 29:47.473
Oh.
Anna's waiting in her room.

29:47.474 --> 29:50.594
Your blessing would
mean a lot to her.

30:02.914 --> 30:04.753
A day for love.

30:04.754 --> 30:06.314
Come in.

30:14.474 --> 30:17.473
Please don't lie to me
to make me feel better.

30:17.474 --> 30:19.114
I won't.

30:22.434 --> 30:25.033
Anna, I will never approve
of this union.

30:25.034 --> 30:26.713
I fear that this...
Mother!

30:26.714 --> 30:28.673
No, please.

30:28.674 --> 30:31.034
I fear that you're making
a terrible mistake.

30:32.634 --> 30:35.393
But I do hope with all my heart

30:35.394 --> 30:37.954
that I'm wrong.

30:41.234 --> 30:45.593
My grandmother gave these
to my mother on her wedding day.

30:45.594 --> 30:48.313
My mother gave them to me.

30:48.314 --> 30:51.594
I always thought
I'd be giving them to you.

30:58.314 --> 31:00.114
Thank you, Grandmother.

31:02.794 --> 31:05.114
I love you more than
you'll ever know.

31:06.594 --> 31:11.314
May you find more happiness
than I could ever imagine.

31:20.434 --> 31:23.314
Three generations of Bligh women.

31:26.514 --> 31:28.474
There will always be trials.

31:30.154 --> 31:32.154
But there is always love.

31:34.394 --> 31:35.954
Oh, darling.

31:37.994 --> 31:39.674
Please come.

31:50.234 --> 31:52.193
Ma, you'll wear a hole in it!

31:52.194 --> 31:54.113
Keep still.

31:54.114 --> 31:56.313
You should get ready.

31:56.314 --> 31:58.793
My beautiful boy!

31:58.794 --> 32:02.394
Head of your own family now.

32:05.554 --> 32:08.153
Dio mio, you already crying!

32:08.154 --> 32:10.633
Wait for when we get to the church!

32:10.634 --> 32:12.834
Mama, the cakes!
Oh, Dio!

32:21.514 --> 32:23.874
Papa, uh...

32:26.194 --> 32:28.114
..there's something I need to ask.

32:29.154 --> 32:31.593
Say no if you'll be
very disappointed.

32:31.594 --> 32:34.953
Uh... it's something I want for Anna.

32:34.954 --> 32:37.033
I can't explain why.
Aspetta.

32:37.034 --> 32:40.754
For Miss Anna today, anything.

32:43.674 --> 32:45.954
Make it quick!

32:47.394 --> 32:49.393
God, you're pushing it, mate.

32:49.394 --> 32:51.513
If you're after something
for last-minute jitters...

32:51.514 --> 32:53.874
No, sir. Uh...

32:55.274 --> 32:58.233
It is wrong you can't be
with your daughter at the altar.

32:58.234 --> 33:00.633
Gino...
The father should be.

33:00.634 --> 33:02.713
That's George Bligh's role.

33:02.714 --> 33:04.873
We've all decided.

33:04.874 --> 33:06.833
There's another part you can play.

33:06.834 --> 33:09.954
It would mean everything to Anna.

33:12.554 --> 33:14.234
Alright, my darling.

33:16.034 --> 33:18.034
Let's get you married.

33:22.590 --> 33:24.130
Perhaps I shouldn't have
been so quick

33:24.139 --> 33:25.605
to rebuff your Colleen suggestion.

33:26.408 --> 33:28.048
No, you were right.

33:28.138 --> 33:31.538
It's time the world met
the very noisy Georgie Bligh.

33:32.457 --> 33:35.136
Shhh.

33:35.137 --> 33:36.776
Shhh.

33:36.777 --> 33:40.976
It's alright. Shhh. It's OK.

33:40.977 --> 33:43.857
Grandmother.

33:45.457 --> 33:48.017
I can ride in the back
with our little prince.

34:06.598 --> 34:08.958
Oh, Mrs Bligh, so happy you came.

34:09.158 --> 34:12.658
Mrs Bligh. Mr James, Miss Olivia.

34:12.683 --> 34:15.722
And this must be the little one.
George.

34:15.723 --> 34:20.242
Oh! Anna joins our family
and little George has joined yours.

34:20.243 --> 34:21.842
Such a blessing.

34:21.842 --> 34:23.603
Excuse me.

34:38.243 --> 34:40.202
This is unexpected.

34:40.203 --> 34:42.402
You too.

34:43.483 --> 34:46.402
Anna and I managed to resolve
some of our differences.

34:46.402 --> 34:48.043
I'm glad.

34:53.443 --> 34:55.641
Me and Gino have become good mates.

34:55.643 --> 34:57.121
Right?

34:57.123 --> 34:59.123
Right.

35:03.923 --> 35:05.563
Your tie is askew.

35:10.683 --> 35:13.723
Not too tight.
Don't wanna strangle me.

35:19.723 --> 35:22.203
I do hope you surprise me.

35:25.043 --> 35:26.803
Thank you.

35:28.643 --> 35:31.243
That borders on
a declaration of love.

35:41.323 --> 35:44.642
Mr Briggs?
Afternoon, Mrs Collins.

35:44.643 --> 35:47.602
Fancy seeing you at
the church of Rome!

35:47.603 --> 35:49.322
For a wedding, no less.

35:49.323 --> 35:52.122
I wonder who'll catch the bouquet!
I wonder!

35:52.123 --> 35:54.723
Sister!
Doris.

35:55.723 --> 35:57.482
I'm lost for words.

35:57.483 --> 35:59.162
There's a turn-up for the
books.

35:59.163 --> 36:01.843
This is my husband,
Dr Rene Nordmann.

36:01.935 --> 36:03.574
Rene, this is Mrs Collins,

36:03.575 --> 36:06.054
one of Inverness's
most famous residents.

36:06.055 --> 36:07.535
Infamous, more like.

36:08.695 --> 36:13.015
Welcome to Inverness, Dr Nordmann.

36:15.895 --> 36:18.174
Indeed, indeed.

36:18.175 --> 36:22.654
Well, if my few words help
bring you home, I'm a happy woman.

36:22.655 --> 36:24.735
I'd best claim a good seat.

36:25.735 --> 36:28.695
Come on, mate. You survive
Doris Collins, you'll survive anything.

36:32.095 --> 36:34.335
Mama, Papa.

36:43.095 --> 36:46.375
Did Father know?
Of course.

36:53.455 --> 36:56.095
Dr and Mrs Nordmann, welcome.

36:57.095 --> 36:58.895
Elizabeth Bligh.

37:01.535 --> 37:03.654
You're guests of the bride,
of course.

37:03.655 --> 37:05.934
I'm glad to see you here.

37:05.935 --> 37:08.255
Thank you. As I am.

37:11.495 --> 37:13.414
Mrs Bligh.

37:13.415 --> 37:15.935
Mr Briggs.

37:27.055 --> 37:29.174
Heads will turn.

37:29.175 --> 37:30.734
As long as George's does.

37:30.735 --> 37:32.454
I hope he's softened towards me.

37:32.455 --> 37:34.614
If absence does make
the heart grow fonder.

37:34.615 --> 37:36.095
We'll see, shall we?

37:51.735 --> 37:53.215
What's wrong?

37:56.535 --> 37:58.295
Je ne sais pas.

38:13.655 --> 38:17.415
Well, well. Saint Sarah
and the cross she bears.

38:28.752 --> 38:31.232
So beautiful.

38:32.751 --> 38:34.871
And you look very handsome.

38:36.991 --> 38:38.311
You ready?

38:39.311 --> 38:41.791
I love you. So much.

38:47.911 --> 38:49.671
Shall we?

38:51.671 --> 38:53.670
There's a surprise for you inside.

38:53.671 --> 38:55.871
You'll see.

39:37.591 --> 39:39.471
What?
Nothing.

39:46.231 --> 39:49.670
Sarah! Is that... my surprise?

39:49.671 --> 39:51.190
Yes.

39:51.191 --> 39:54.550
I can't... I can't believe
that you're here!

39:54.551 --> 39:56.031
Thank you.

39:57.191 --> 39:58.750
Congratulations.

39:58.751 --> 40:00.230
I'm so happy!

40:00.231 --> 40:01.670
Dr Nordmann.

40:01.671 --> 40:03.551
Anna.

40:30.551 --> 40:32.710
Gino and Anna,

40:32.711 --> 40:35.110
you have come together
in this church

40:35.111 --> 40:39.630
so the Lord may seal
and strengthen your love.

40:39.631 --> 40:43.590
Christ has already consecrated you
in baptism.

40:43.591 --> 40:49.110
Now he enriches and strengthens you
by a special sacrament

40:49.111 --> 40:52.910
so that you may assume
the duties of marriage

40:52.911 --> 40:56.110
with mutual and lasting fidelity.

40:56.111 --> 40:58.990
So in the presence of the church,

40:58.991 --> 41:02.031
I ask you to state your intentions.

41:05.991 --> 41:10.910
Gino and Anna, have you come here
freely, without reservations,

41:10.911 --> 41:14.310
giving yourself to each other
in marriage?

41:14.311 --> 41:17.311
We have.
Yes.

41:18.991 --> 41:21.950
And will you love each other
and honour each other

41:21.951 --> 41:25.230
as man and wife
for the rest of your lives?

41:25.231 --> 41:27.391
I will.
I will.

41:28.391 --> 41:32.950
And will you accept children
lovingly from God

41:32.951 --> 41:35.670
and bring them up
according to the law of Christ

41:35.671 --> 41:37.550
and his holy church?

41:37.551 --> 41:40.031
Yes.
I will.

41:42.271 --> 41:45.790
Since you have expressed the
intention to enter into marriage,

41:45.791 --> 41:48.271
join together your right hands...

41:50.511 --> 41:55.551
..and declare your consent
before God and His church.

42:17.911 --> 42:19.630
Ciao!

42:19.631 --> 42:21.111
'Bye!

42:33.191 --> 42:36.671
First the reception, and then
we move to the next phase, I think.

42:51.431 --> 42:53.230
You're sure about this?

42:53.231 --> 42:56.670
I had quite enough to drink
at the reception.

42:56.671 --> 42:58.511
To dull the pain.

43:02.831 --> 43:05.071
When it's done, you'd best go.

43:12.471 --> 43:13.951
He'll come looking for you.

43:21.111 --> 43:22.631
Do it!

43:30.151 --> 43:32.671
George will need
more convincing than that.

43:34.591 --> 43:35.991
Do it properly.

43:42.671 --> 43:44.511
Again.

43:49.038 --> 43:50.398
I swore I'd have him one day.

43:52.118 --> 43:53.477
We have a lifetime of this.

43:53.478 --> 43:54.758
I don't know where else to go.

43:57.958 --> 43:59.758
I'll inform the police.
No!

44:00.438 --> 44:01.638
I'll see to her.

44:04.078 --> 44:05.677
There will be consequences
if you interfere.

44:05.678 --> 44:08.158
The monster she's created.

44:08.758 --> 44:11.157
I've constructed
the most beautiful bomb.

44:11.158 --> 44:13.677
Only one person can save them.

44:13.678 --> 44:16.037
He needs to hear
the truth about her.

44:16.038 --> 44:18.037
He still loves you deeply.

44:18.038 --> 44:19.197
Please.

44:19.198 --> 44:20.437
But is it too late?

44:20.438 --> 44:21.718
Stay.

44:22.518 --> 44:24.197
What she started...

44:24.198 --> 44:26.757
I sensed that you would
ruin my family.

44:26.758 --> 44:29.397
..in this final incredible hour.

44:29.398 --> 44:31.798
There is a cancer
at the heart of your family.

44:38.158 --> 44:41.384
We shall see.
We shall.
