00:39.572 --> 00:42.268
We're not a threat. We're salvation.

00:42.509 --> 00:44.568
The world will have to deal with us.

00:45.111 --> 00:47.011
Previously on The 4400:

00:47.180 --> 00:48.704
Lily, are you all right?

00:49.783 --> 00:51.580
- Where's my wife?
- What are you talking about?

00:51.751 --> 00:55.847
Mr. Tyler, when your wife fainted this
morning, she was a young woman.

00:56.022 --> 00:57.956
When she woke up
less than a minute later,

00:58.124 --> 01:00.490
she was 50 years older?

01:00.660 --> 01:01.888
Are you my mother?

01:03.163 --> 01:04.790
Richard, I'm dying.

01:04.964 --> 01:07.228
I understand there was
an incident this morning.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.231
You attempted to harm yourself.

01:09.636 --> 01:11.035
You had no right to do that!

01:11.204 --> 01:14.264
Don't you understand who you are?
What you're here to do?

01:14.441 --> 01:18.104
I'm injecting myself with a modified
version of the promicin serum.

01:18.278 --> 01:22.078
I will have taught my body
how to produce promicin.

01:22.248 --> 01:27.447
And then I will be the first non-returnee
to develop 4400 abilities.

01:27.620 --> 01:29.349
That was T.J. Kim
running from the courthouse.

01:29.522 --> 01:32.616
When she hit, T.J. drove every man
in the building into a homicidal rage.

01:32.792 --> 01:34.384
Ever since we took them
off the inhibitor,

01:34.561 --> 01:36.085
they're either developing
new abilities

01:36.262 --> 01:38.196
or they're refining the ones
that they've got.

01:38.364 --> 01:39.831
So they are getting more dangerous.

01:39.999 --> 01:42.092
You saved my life. I owe you.

01:43.369 --> 01:44.529
You sold us out.

01:44.704 --> 01:47.298
I don't guess we'll be seeing her
in court anytime soon.

01:47.474 --> 01:48.907
This is a message
from the Nova Group.

01:49.075 --> 01:51.839
We are the defensive wing
of the 4400.

01:52.011 --> 01:53.706
Today, the world has seen
what happens

01:53.880 --> 01:55.643
to those who try to harm us.

01:55.815 --> 01:58.010
A new era dawns.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.365
Hi.

02:19.205 --> 02:21.833
I'll need your auxiliary rounds as well,
Agent Baldwin.

02:22.675 --> 02:24.040
Oh, yeah.

02:24.210 --> 02:27.043
Of course. I forgot again.

02:27.213 --> 02:29.374
- Thanks. You can go in.
- Great.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.548
Hi, T.J.

02:44.564 --> 02:46.191
What do you want?

02:46.900 --> 02:48.800
Dr. Burkhoff?

02:49.302 --> 02:51.736
I have your prescriptions.

02:52.939 --> 02:54.634
Hello?

02:55.241 --> 02:56.708
Say something if you're here.

02:56.876 --> 02:59.071
No, don't.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.074
Please.

03:03.082 --> 03:04.549
I've been having migraines.

03:05.985 --> 03:07.384
How severe?

03:08.521 --> 03:10.250
Bad enough.

03:10.423 --> 03:11.947
Don't worry. They're just headaches.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.717
I've been getting them for years.

03:19.666 --> 03:22.226
Seven forty-five.

03:22.402 --> 03:25.337
You're just in time
for my wake-up call.

03:25.939 --> 03:30.069
These promicin shots,
how many a day are you up to now?

03:32.779 --> 03:33.871
Six.

03:34.981 --> 03:36.414
You've doubled your dosage?

03:37.584 --> 03:39.882
I thought you weren't gonna do that
without talking to me.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.418
We're talking now.

03:41.588 --> 03:46.355
Look, I'm training my body
to produce a new neurotransmitter.

03:46.526 --> 03:48.994
And I guarantee you,
I'm not the only one trying.

03:49.896 --> 03:53.957
The moment the first 4400
manifested an ability,

03:54.133 --> 03:56.328
an arms race began.

03:56.603 --> 03:59.868
Someone is going to produce
a promicin serum

04:00.039 --> 04:03.702
that will cause non-4400s
to develop extraordinary abilities.

04:03.876 --> 04:05.070
It will happen.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.872
And the only questions are:

04:07.046 --> 04:10.641
who's going to do it?
And who's going to control it?

04:10.817 --> 04:14.981
Hopefully, someone with a highly
developed sense of responsibility.

04:15.388 --> 04:16.582
And some judgment.

04:16.755 --> 04:17.916
Let me ask you,

04:18.091 --> 04:20.719
do you meet many people like that
in your day-to-day affairs?

04:20.892 --> 04:22.952
Do a lot of them
hold high-ranking government posts

04:23.129 --> 04:26.621
or sit on the board
of giant pharmaceutical companies?

04:26.799 --> 04:30.929
Dr. Burkhoff, I knew
that you had some personality quirks,

04:31.104 --> 04:33.265
but I never pegged you for a cynic.

04:36.843 --> 04:40.506
I can't afford to have a charitable view
of human nature.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.272
There's too much at stake here.

04:42.448 --> 04:45.611
If these experiments
cost me some headaches,

04:45.785 --> 04:47.275
some sores,

04:47.453 --> 04:49.853
I'd say that's a price worth paying.

04:50.556 --> 04:52.217
Wouldn't you?

04:53.226 --> 04:55.319
I'm here, right?

05:53.986 --> 05:55.510
Holy mother!

06:02.628 --> 06:04.619
Why are we doing this?

06:04.797 --> 06:06.697
Everything I'm telling you,
it's all in my file.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.629
You know it already.

06:08.801 --> 06:10.325
Relax, T.J.

06:10.503 --> 06:11.902
I just think it's important we review

06:12.071 --> 06:13.766
everything you told
the government so far.

06:13.940 --> 06:16.272
- Have we?
- Yes.

06:16.442 --> 06:19.536
I keep telling you, yes.
That's everything I know.

06:21.147 --> 06:22.637
Okay.

06:22.815 --> 06:24.407
Thanks for your cooperation.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.487
We're just trying
to consolidate information.

06:30.656 --> 06:34.592
You'd be amazed how hard
that can be in a bureaucracy.

06:34.861 --> 06:39.491
Yeah, well, I hope you don't expect
me to say, "You're welcome."

06:41.567 --> 06:42.829
What are you doing?

06:44.470 --> 06:45.596
What, this?

06:46.072 --> 06:49.064
It's nothing.
I'm just wrapping up the interview.

08:15.027 --> 08:16.654
Get geared up.
We're leaving in two minutes.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.763
What for? What's going on?

08:19.031 --> 08:21.465
Your partner registered
to see T.J. Kim this morning.

08:21.634 --> 08:23.431
When Tom left the interview room,
T.J. was dead.

08:23.603 --> 08:25.468
- What?
- Two gunshot wounds to the head.

08:25.638 --> 08:28.471
Apparently, Tom snuck a small firearm
into the interrogation room.

08:28.641 --> 08:30.939
By the time the guard went in
and found T.J.'s body,

08:31.110 --> 08:32.668
Tom had already left the building.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.710
- I'm going to pick him up now.
- Oh, wait, wait.

08:34.881 --> 08:37.873
This is Tom we're talking about, here.
There's gotta be some explanation.

08:38.049 --> 08:40.211
Now, maybe T.J.
used her ability on him.

08:40.385 --> 08:43.116
No, she had concentrated promicin
inhibitor pumping through her veins.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.450
We tried to contact Tom,
but he hasn't been picking up.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.616
We need to get him in
and figure out what happened.

08:47.793 --> 08:50.591
Okay, well just let me talk to him first.
He trusts me.

08:50.763 --> 08:53.288
Look, this is Tom.

08:53.466 --> 08:55.832
Come on, we owe him that much.

08:57.336 --> 08:59.099
Yeah, okay.

09:03.576 --> 09:06.807
I wasn't trying to drown myself.

09:07.146 --> 09:08.408
I don't even know if I could.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.079
Okay.

09:10.249 --> 09:13.707
Isabelle, I just thought that after
everything that happened with Lily--

09:13.886 --> 09:16.377
Shawn, this has nothing to do
with my mother.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.724
I was teaching myself to swim.

09:23.596 --> 09:25.359
In your clothes?

09:25.531 --> 09:27.965
I never wore a bathing suit before.

09:28.134 --> 09:30.034
I didn't know what to get.

09:31.003 --> 09:32.971
And I'm too old to ask for help.

09:33.139 --> 09:35.198
It's embarrassing
not knowing how to swim.

09:35.374 --> 09:38.241
Everybody's got to learn sometime,
lsabelle.

09:38.878 --> 09:40.778
I learned when I was a kid.

09:40.947 --> 09:42.471
But I never was a kid.

09:42.648 --> 09:45.014
That's why I never learned
how to swim or how to drive.

09:45.184 --> 09:47.550
Or ever went out on a date.

09:47.720 --> 09:51.315
I keep reading
about all these rites of passage.

09:51.490 --> 09:54.118
Like stuff everyone goes through
before they grow up, yeah?

09:54.293 --> 09:56.193
Yeah, but I am grown up.

09:56.362 --> 09:58.626
And I missed out on all of it.

09:59.498 --> 10:00.795
It's not fair.

10:02.168 --> 10:05.194
- I've got to catch up, so I made a list.
- A list?

10:05.371 --> 10:07.396
That's pretty organized.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.338
Well, lsabelle,
there is a pool at the Center.

10:11.510 --> 10:13.444
I could probably teach you
the basics.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.046
Really?

10:17.617 --> 10:19.346
Thanks, Shawn.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.667
Dad?

10:36.669 --> 10:38.762
How old were you
when you learned how to swim?

10:42.975 --> 10:44.203
Oh, about 1 1, I guess.

10:45.378 --> 10:47.608
Why? You want me to teach you?

10:47.780 --> 10:50.248
That's okay. Shawn said he'd do it.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.875
Oh, he did, did he?

10:53.419 --> 10:54.681
Well,

10:54.854 --> 10:57.186
make sure he doesn't throw you
in the deep end right away.

10:57.356 --> 11:00.086
That's what my grandmother
did to me.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.360
Look, lsabelle.
I'm gonna be gone overnight.

11:03.529 --> 11:06.692
- If you need anything, go see Shawn.
- Where are you going?

11:08.768 --> 11:10.759
I'm gonna take your mother home.

11:11.303 --> 11:13.066
I'm putting her to rest.

11:13.572 --> 11:15.062
Well, can I come with you?

11:17.243 --> 11:18.232
I don't think so.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.876
I'm flying

11:22.248 --> 11:24.011
and to tell you the truth,

11:24.650 --> 11:27.050
I don't think you're ready to be away
from the Center yet.

11:28.754 --> 11:32.349
You want to be alone with her
when you say goodbye, don't you?

11:36.762 --> 11:38.992
Yeah. I guess I do.

12:13.966 --> 12:15.593
- Tom.
- Oh, God!

12:16.736 --> 12:19.569
You scared the hell out of me, Diana.
What are you doing here?

12:21.140 --> 12:23.040
Why is your gun out?
What the hell is going on?

12:23.209 --> 12:25.268
Jarvis is on her way over,
she's got everyone with her.

12:25.444 --> 12:26.877
You need to come in.

12:27.246 --> 12:30.579
- Why? What are you talking about?
- You shot T.J. Kim this morning.

12:31.383 --> 12:32.714
- What?
- You don't remember?

12:32.885 --> 12:34.352
Don't remember?
I didn't shoot anybody.

12:34.520 --> 12:37.011
- I've been here all morning.
- Can someone confirm that?

12:38.457 --> 12:42.018
No, no, I was supposed to have
a conference call with Kyle's attorneys.

12:42.194 --> 12:43.718
They cancelled, though.

12:44.196 --> 12:46.255
Look, I took a half a personal day,
Diana.

12:46.432 --> 12:49.026
I went jogging. I wasn't at work.

12:49.201 --> 12:52.728
You gotta stop saying that because
two dozen people saw you there.

12:52.905 --> 12:55.806
Look, I don't know
what's going on. I--

12:56.408 --> 12:58.842
Maybe you're blacking out
like Kyle did.

12:59.011 --> 13:02.139
Maybe it's something else.
Maybe it's like some 4400 ability.

13:02.314 --> 13:05.511
I mean, I don't know,
but you gotta come in.

13:05.851 --> 13:07.341
And what happens if I do?

13:07.520 --> 13:10.045
- I get arrested for murder?
- You know, we'll figure it out, okay?

13:10.222 --> 13:12.884
Everyone wants to help you.
You just have to come in.

13:16.695 --> 13:19.960
- You mind if I get dressed first?
- Oh, sure.

13:24.403 --> 13:26.564
Are you sure you remember everything
you did this morning?

13:26.739 --> 13:29.435
Like there's no time gaps
or anything?

13:29.608 --> 13:31.542
You didn't take a nap?

13:31.710 --> 13:33.575
Because, Tom...

13:35.014 --> 13:36.606
Tom?

13:40.986 --> 13:42.578
Damn it!

13:47.326 --> 13:50.659
Yeah, hi, it's me. He got away.

13:52.398 --> 13:55.561
I don't know how.
They only sent one agent after him.

13:55.734 --> 13:58.669
Look, sorry. He got away.

13:58.971 --> 14:02.930
What? No way. He's an NTAC agent.
He'll be expecting that.

14:03.909 --> 14:05.274
Okay.

14:05.878 --> 14:07.675
You're right. This has to happen.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.314
I'll do it.

14:09.982 --> 14:11.813
I was letting him get dressed.

14:11.984 --> 14:14.418
I didn't think he would jump
from a second story window.

14:14.587 --> 14:17.112
Well, obviously you underestimated
your partner's resolve.

14:17.289 --> 14:19.621
- Does he still seem blameless to you?
- I don't know.

14:19.792 --> 14:22.659
Look, it was a really bad call
and I take full responsibility.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.489
I've alerted local law enforcement,
the FBl.

14:24.830 --> 14:26.661
I've told them that Tom
is wanted for questioning

14:26.832 --> 14:29.392
in connection with a murder.
He's a fugitive now.

14:29.568 --> 14:31.866
Oh, don't give me that look, Diana.
I had no choice.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.071
Sorry.

14:35.241 --> 14:36.469
- It's Tom.
- Yeah.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.471
Tom.

14:38.644 --> 14:40.009
I'm sorry I ran out on you.

14:40.179 --> 14:42.511
- Where are you?
- I didn't kill T.J. I didn't kill anyone.

14:42.681 --> 14:45.479
I believe you. But you have to come in,
we can figure out what's going on.

14:45.651 --> 14:48.142
- No, I'm not going to jail.
- No one's gonna put you in prison.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.787
They did it to my son, Diana.

14:50.422 --> 14:53.084
Was it really him that pulled the trigger
the day Jordan Collier died?

14:53.259 --> 14:55.386
No, it wasn't, was it?
It was that thing inside of him.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.791
- And where's Kyle? He's incarcerated.
- You're a fugitive.

14:57.963 --> 15:00.363
Every police department
in Washington is looking for you.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.625
Now, some local cop
wants to be a hero, spots you,

15:02.801 --> 15:04.098
you know how these things can end.

15:04.270 --> 15:06.397
No, it's gonna end with me
proving I didn't do this.

15:07.306 --> 15:08.898
Look, dig around, Diana.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.905
There's got to be some evidence
that'll clear me.

15:11.076 --> 15:14.409
Just help me find it.

15:16.615 --> 15:18.207
Did he give you a location?

15:26.659 --> 15:29.184
Marco, help me out here.

15:29.662 --> 15:32.495
If you were trying to prove
that your partner didn't commit a crime

15:32.665 --> 15:35.293
that the whole world thinks he did,

15:35.467 --> 15:37.298
where would you start?

15:37.603 --> 15:42.006
Well, I guess I'd start by pretending
that my partner wasn't involved.

15:43.642 --> 15:46.202
Okay, just think of it
like any other case.

15:46.378 --> 15:48.039
What's the first thing you do
when you start?

15:48.213 --> 15:49.680
Well, look at the evidence.

15:50.082 --> 15:53.313
I mean, there's a dead body.
There's the gun that Tom left behind.

15:53.485 --> 15:55.510
And there's a bunch of people
that saw him here.

15:57.289 --> 16:00.349
Well, they've got security cameras
down in the detention ward, right?

16:01.660 --> 16:02.922
You're serious?

16:03.095 --> 16:05.290
You're really asking me
for all that footage?

16:05.464 --> 16:07.591
Of course I'm serious.
Is that a problem?

16:07.766 --> 16:09.324
Well, it's just...

16:10.169 --> 16:13.263
I gave all the tapes to him,
like, an hour ago.

16:15.107 --> 16:17.667
What are you talking about?
I haven't been up here all day.

16:18.377 --> 16:19.844
What is this, a joke?

16:20.412 --> 16:23.074
Marco, come on.
You were just here.

16:23.248 --> 16:25.739
You signed for all the footage
from the detention ward.

16:29.488 --> 16:32.855
- This isn't so hard.
- That's because I haven't let go yet.

16:33.025 --> 16:34.890
All right, I'm gonna move my hands.
Are you ready?

16:35.060 --> 16:37.824
No, not yet.
I'm kind of comfortable.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.225
You're kind of comfortable?

16:40.165 --> 16:42.099
I'm freezing.
I don't know what's going on.

16:42.267 --> 16:44.861
- This pool is supposed to be heated.
- Want me to make it warmer?

16:45.204 --> 16:48.640
- Oh, you can do that?
- I think so. Hold on.

16:56.382 --> 16:57.872
How do you do that?

16:58.517 --> 17:00.109
I don't know. How do you heal?

17:01.153 --> 17:04.645
It's not the same, lsabelle.
Healing's one thing.

17:04.823 --> 17:06.518
That's what we can all do, one thing.

17:06.692 --> 17:09.252
Not me. I guess I'm different.

17:11.230 --> 17:14.494
Shawn? I'm sorry to barge in.

17:14.665 --> 17:16.896
We're scheduled to brief
the board of directors.

17:17.069 --> 17:20.732
- That's starting now?
- Five minutes ago. They're on hold.

17:42.428 --> 17:43.656
Alana.

17:43.829 --> 17:47.094
Thomas. What are you doing here?

17:47.499 --> 17:51.629
I'm in trouble. My bosses at NTAC,
they think I did something.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.795
- I need you to come.
- What are you talking about?

17:53.972 --> 17:56.236
- I don't have time to explain. Just--
- Thomas!

18:00.446 --> 18:01.777
- Hello?
- Alana.

18:01.947 --> 18:04.472
I'm right down the street.
I need you to come meet me.

18:05.284 --> 18:07.775
Honey, I'm in trouble.
Everyone thinks I killed somebody.

18:07.953 --> 18:11.252
- Who is this? I know it's not Thomas.
- What are you talking about?

18:11.423 --> 18:13.948
I'm looking at Thomas right now.

18:14.326 --> 18:15.793
Honey, listen. That's not me.

18:15.961 --> 18:18.691
The man you're looking at,
he can impersonate me somehow.

18:19.364 --> 18:20.422
I don't believe you.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.829
He walked into NTAC
and he shot someone this morning.

18:23.335 --> 18:25.496
Alana, he's dangerous,
get away from him.

18:25.671 --> 18:28.299
Alana, listen to me. Your mother's
middle name is Madeleine.

18:28.474 --> 18:31.034
You wanted a dog when you were
a kid, your parents gave you a bird.

18:31.210 --> 18:32.939
A parakeet named Charlie.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.808
Listen, we made love last night.
There were two candles burning.

18:35.981 --> 18:37.471
Just hold on. I'll be right there.

18:40.886 --> 18:42.979
- Did I have a dog?
- I don't have time for this.

18:43.155 --> 18:45.817
- What are you doing? Let me go!
- What's going on, Tom?

18:51.296 --> 18:52.627
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.562
- Where is he?
- He just ran through the back.

19:01.106 --> 19:02.403
Hey!

19:03.742 --> 19:06.233
Did you see a guy come down
this alley? He looked exactly like me.

19:06.411 --> 19:09.005
- I didn't see anybody.
- You sure?

19:21.727 --> 19:24.161
He's gone. He's gone.

19:24.329 --> 19:26.854
What do you mean?
He just ran out a few seconds ago.

19:27.032 --> 19:29.865
There was no one here.
Just some kid...

19:31.403 --> 19:35.339
It was him. It had to be.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.036
I had him. I had him.

19:38.210 --> 19:40.644
Had who?
What kid are you talking about?

19:40.812 --> 19:42.780
The one who's impersonating me.

19:43.148 --> 19:45.582
The guy who's framing me
for murder.

19:51.256 --> 19:52.723
He looked like you,
he sounded like you.

19:52.891 --> 19:54.859
He was standing
as close as you are to me right now.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.585
And he had me completely fooled.

19:56.762 --> 19:59.424
Don't feel bad.
He fooled everyone at NTAC too.

19:59.998 --> 20:01.625
At least we know
what's going on now.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.291
- He's a 4400, isn't he?
- Yeah.

20:04.469 --> 20:06.369
Somehow he can
pass himself off as you.

20:06.538 --> 20:07.562
Yeah, I'm not sure how.

20:07.973 --> 20:11.033
I mean, maybe he's got
some kind of optical camouflage.

20:11.210 --> 20:14.236
He convinces your brain you're talking
to whoever he wants you to see.

20:14.413 --> 20:16.677
He's a boy.
Why would he want to kill anyone?

20:16.848 --> 20:18.839
Not just anybody. T.J. Kim.

20:19.017 --> 20:21.417
The one member
of the Nova Group we had in custody.

20:21.587 --> 20:24.647
I mean, think about it.
It's a good plan.

20:24.823 --> 20:26.381
You get rid of the one member
of your cell

20:26.558 --> 20:27.889
who could testify against you.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.425
You compromise
a government agent.

20:29.595 --> 20:33.122
And NTAC, the one agency
that's trying to hunt you down,

20:33.298 --> 20:35.266
is wasting their time
chasing one of their own.

20:35.434 --> 20:38.130
Alana.
You might want to get in here.

20:38.303 --> 20:40.601
There's all kind of people
flashing badges everywhere.

20:40.772 --> 20:42.467
They say they're NTAC agents.

20:42.641 --> 20:44.541
Look, stall them.
I want you to go home.

20:44.710 --> 20:45.768
I want you to lock the doors

20:45.944 --> 20:48.276
and don't open it
until this is all cleared up.

20:48.447 --> 20:51.507
If I need to get ahold of you,
I'll use a password.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.514
How about Death in Venice?

20:54.686 --> 20:57.086
Your favorite book.
It's a good choice.

21:01.793 --> 21:03.693
Listen, Shawn,
thanks for letting me come in here.

21:03.862 --> 21:06.763
I know it puts you at risk.
I just didn't know where else to go.

21:07.599 --> 21:10.534
Look, you guys must have a database
of 4400s here, right?

21:10.702 --> 21:11.964
- Yeah.
- I need to get a look

21:12.137 --> 21:13.263
and find out who this kid is.

21:13.438 --> 21:16.373
Here, I can pull it up
on my laptop for you.

21:18.243 --> 21:19.938
This might take a while,
you mind if I let myself out?

21:20.279 --> 21:22.076
No, that's fine.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.179
There you go. You know,

21:27.452 --> 21:29.682
Uncle Tommy,
you can stay here if you want.

21:30.789 --> 21:32.518
- I might take you up on it.
- All right.

21:33.325 --> 21:35.316
But, hey, you get the couch.

21:38.630 --> 21:40.257
Okay.

21:40.666 --> 21:42.463
Kidneys, huh?

21:42.634 --> 21:44.568
That explains the blood in the urine.

21:44.736 --> 21:47.136
Kevin, we had a deal.
I was gonna help you through this

21:47.306 --> 21:49.206
as long as it wasn't compromising
your health.

21:49.374 --> 21:51.968
Well, guess what?
I'm calling the hospital.

21:52.544 --> 21:54.535
But they won't let me take my shots.

21:54.713 --> 21:56.806
Oh, no. You're done with your shots.

21:57.115 --> 22:00.881
I know we had an agreement.
And I'll honor it.

22:01.053 --> 22:04.147
Just let me show you something
before you call.

22:08.994 --> 22:11.019
What happened to your fingernails?

22:11.263 --> 22:14.061
They fell off.
Dissolved, I guess you'd say.

22:14.232 --> 22:17.668
God, if you're trying to change my
mind, you're not doing a very good job.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.899
Kevin, what the hell did you just do?

22:34.386 --> 22:39.824
Your tissue is healing itself
from trauma that quickly?

22:41.193 --> 22:43.753
Kevin, you've developed
a 4400 ability.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.288
It's getting there.

22:46.465 --> 22:47.727
It doesn't always work.

22:48.834 --> 22:50.495
Doesn't always work?
You just put a scalpel

22:50.669 --> 22:53.137
- through the back of your hand.
- I know.

22:53.305 --> 22:54.738
I was nervous about that.

23:08.653 --> 23:12.316
- These are fun to drive fast.
- Yeah.

23:13.792 --> 23:15.987
You know, all that information
about compression rates

23:16.161 --> 23:18.721
and gear ratios
just seems completely irrelevant.

23:18.897 --> 23:22.333
Well, you're not driving home.
Get out of there.

23:23.902 --> 23:26.063
You're lucky you didn't wrap my car
around a pole.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.729
Is there anything on this list of yours
that involves, you know,

23:29.074 --> 23:31.167
a little less risk of bodily harm?

23:33.111 --> 23:36.103
We could have sex.
Come on, you have a big bed.

23:36.281 --> 23:38.579
Isabelle. Hey, hey.

23:40.152 --> 23:42.586
- No.
- Why? It's on my list.

23:44.055 --> 23:46.785
It's an important rite of passage
into adulthood.

23:47.559 --> 23:49.527
It'll be fun. I was good at driving.

23:50.061 --> 23:52.029
I'm sure you'd catch on real quick.

23:54.533 --> 23:55.966
I don't know.

23:56.134 --> 23:58.227
For one thing,
your dad would kill me.

23:58.403 --> 23:59.768
Why? I'm an adult.

23:59.938 --> 24:02.270
Well, you are
and you aren't, lsabelle.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.932
Let's just say he has a right
to have an opinion on the matter.

24:05.110 --> 24:08.841
I don't know, lsabelle. I feel like
I'd be taking advantage of you.

24:09.014 --> 24:10.038
But I want to.

24:11.917 --> 24:14.112
I'm flattered. I really am.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.447
But I just don't think you're ready
to make that decision.

24:16.621 --> 24:18.111
We barely know each other.

24:18.290 --> 24:21.691
I know you better
than I know anyone else in the world.

24:24.896 --> 24:27.888
That may be true.
It's still not gonna happen.

24:33.772 --> 24:36.297
Lessons with lsabelle going well?

24:36.475 --> 24:39.467
Not lessons
and it's completely innocent.

24:40.145 --> 24:43.637
Do me a favor and
don't ask about them again.

24:53.225 --> 24:55.318
- This is Skouris.
- His name is Boyd Gelder, Diana.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.189
He's a 4400. I know where he lives.

24:57.762 --> 24:59.457
Where who lives?
Who's Boyd Gelder?

24:59.631 --> 25:01.258
The kid who's doing this.

25:01.433 --> 25:04.732
He can imitate me somehow.
And not just imitate. He can be me.

25:04.903 --> 25:07.497
At least make you think he's me.

25:07.672 --> 25:10.266
He lives with his mom. I'm in
Schenley Park. It's right by his house.

25:10.442 --> 25:12.273
Well, can you wait for me?
I'll be 1 5 minutes.

25:12.444 --> 25:15.277
I'll wait. But, Diana, just you.

25:15.447 --> 25:17.108
Just me.

25:18.049 --> 25:19.448
We just got here.
Where are you going?

25:19.618 --> 25:22.052
Schenley Park. I think
we caught a break on Tom's case.

25:38.403 --> 25:40.030
Tom!

25:42.374 --> 25:44.035
Tom!

26:14.806 --> 26:16.706
I didn't tell anyone, Tom.

26:16.875 --> 26:18.809
Just Marco.

26:20.445 --> 26:22.811
At least I thought it was Marco.

26:27.352 --> 26:29.946
I looked across the park,
you were standing there.

26:30.288 --> 26:32.051
It was you.

26:32.223 --> 26:33.952
- But it wasn't.
- Listen, tell me about it.

26:34.125 --> 26:37.026
You weren't the one actually
chasing yourself across the park.

26:37.195 --> 26:40.824
I mean, I don't really run like that,
do l?

26:42.500 --> 26:44.468
It's an amazing ability.

26:44.636 --> 26:46.467
Marco's gonna have a field day
over this.

26:46.638 --> 26:47.798
Good. Get him working on it.

26:47.973 --> 26:50.999
We'll need a way to handle this guy
when we get him into custody.

26:51.176 --> 26:52.268
Well, wait, wait, wait.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.139
No, you don't need
to skulk around anymore.

26:54.312 --> 26:55.711
You can come in with me now.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.541
I'm still on the hook
for murder, Diana.

26:57.716 --> 27:00.082
No, you're not. Boyd posed as you.

27:00.251 --> 27:02.242
He shot T.J. Kim.
You're not responsible.

27:02.420 --> 27:05.321
Listen, I just saw his abilities
with my own eyes.

27:05.490 --> 27:06.957
That's proof of something,
right there.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.786
I will back you up
on everything you say.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.894
Which means exactly nothing.

27:11.062 --> 27:12.654
Thank you, Diana,
but you're my partner.

27:12.831 --> 27:14.731
Everyone expects you
to stand up for me.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.760
There's only one way to prove
I didn't kill T.J. Kim.

27:17.936 --> 27:21.235
- I have to get Boyd Gelder.
- Okay, let's go.

27:21.940 --> 27:23.373
Are you sure you want to come?

27:23.541 --> 27:24.974
I'm your partner.

27:25.143 --> 27:27.168
Everyone expects
that I'll stand up for you.

27:33.084 --> 27:34.984
I should be back by tonight.

27:35.153 --> 27:37.121
I've been taking my time,

27:37.288 --> 27:40.223
stopping off at all the places
your mother liked.

27:43.161 --> 27:45.823
Everything okay? You been going
to your doctor's appointments?

27:45.997 --> 27:47.988
- Most of them.
- Isabelle.

27:48.633 --> 27:51.500
- We'll need to keep monitoring you.
- I'm fine.

27:51.803 --> 27:54.135
Shawn's been taking good care of me
just like you asked.

27:54.305 --> 27:55.431
He's doing a really good job.

27:56.207 --> 27:58.402
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

27:58.576 --> 28:00.703
He taught me the back stroke.
He let me drive his car.

28:01.846 --> 28:04.440
And then I asked him
to have sex with me, but he said no.

28:04.616 --> 28:06.675
He said you'd be angry
if we did. Is that true?

28:08.820 --> 28:10.378
Isabelle,

28:11.256 --> 28:13.724
you're too young
to be thinking about

28:14.926 --> 28:17.121
- that.
- I am?

28:17.295 --> 28:19.661
But I thought I was almost 20.
What--?

28:19.831 --> 28:21.696
How old were you
when you lost your virginity?

28:23.802 --> 28:25.326
It was--

28:26.571 --> 28:29.199
Things were a bit different in my day.
It's not the same.

28:29.374 --> 28:30.773
It's not?

28:31.176 --> 28:32.905
Why?

28:34.179 --> 28:36.204
You know what, lsabelle?

28:36.748 --> 28:39.216
I'm not having this conversation
with you over the phone.

28:41.119 --> 28:43.087
So, Shawn was right. You are mad.

28:46.224 --> 28:47.885
I don't understand.

28:48.059 --> 28:50.186
What does NTAC wanna talk
to my son for, anyway?

28:50.361 --> 28:52.295
Look, he's in some trouble
we can't discuss.

28:52.464 --> 28:54.227
We just needed to talk to him.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.162
Well, he's not here.

28:56.334 --> 28:58.063
He went away on a ski-trip
with some friends

28:58.236 --> 28:59.430
and won't be back till tomorrow.

28:59.604 --> 29:00.798
Ma'am,

29:01.005 --> 29:02.939
your son is not on a ski-trip
and this is serious.

29:03.108 --> 29:04.769
Is there any way
you can contact him?

29:06.811 --> 29:08.073
First, tell me what's going on.

29:08.246 --> 29:10.441
I mean, what is it
you think my son did?

29:11.382 --> 29:13.748
Mrs. Gelder, there are a lot of agents
looking for Boyd.

29:13.918 --> 29:15.909
Situations like this
can get very chaotic.

29:16.087 --> 29:18.817
People get hurt. The sooner we get
to your son, the safer he'll be.

29:19.190 --> 29:23.650
So why don't you call him
and convince him you need to see him.

29:34.472 --> 29:36.770
Boyd's late.
I wonder if he'll even show.

29:36.941 --> 29:39.409
Let's just give him
another few minutes.

29:40.211 --> 29:44.113
Nice mom. Nice house.
It makes you wonder.

29:44.282 --> 29:47.445
If the Nova Group can turn this kid,
who else have they gotten to?

29:47.619 --> 29:50.520
Everyone keeps telling the 4400
they're here to save the world.

29:50.688 --> 29:52.417
- Whatever that means.
- Exactly.

29:52.590 --> 29:55.559
I mean, say what you like about Nova,
they do seem to have a game plan.

29:55.727 --> 29:58.389
I'm sure that helps
their recruiting pitch.

30:01.699 --> 30:04.566
Well, I'm just guessing,
but I don't think that's Boyd.

30:04.736 --> 30:06.897
How the hell did NTAC get here?

30:07.071 --> 30:10.234
Maybe Boyd figured out it was a trap
and tipped them off.

30:27.625 --> 30:30.287
- Thomas.
- Alana, open up.

30:30.461 --> 30:32.793
What are you doing here?
NTAC agents are watching the house.

30:32.964 --> 30:34.022
They just drove away.

30:34.199 --> 30:37.191
They must be changing shifts
or something. Come on, let me in.

30:38.269 --> 30:39.702
Death in Venice, okay? Open up.

30:42.006 --> 30:44.236
I don't want anyone to see me
standing out here. Come on.

30:45.276 --> 30:46.436
What did you do with your key?

30:47.478 --> 30:49.742
I lost it. I must have lost it
while I was running around.

30:49.914 --> 30:53.714
Come on, it's me, Tom, Alana.
I gave you the password.

31:00.658 --> 31:03.627
Please don't make me.
I don't have anything against you.

31:08.099 --> 31:10.897
Tom, it says it's your house.

31:11.436 --> 31:14.428
- Alana?
- I wrote a letter on your computer.

31:14.606 --> 31:16.073
You need to come sign it.

31:16.608 --> 31:18.803
- Boyd?
- It's a confession.

31:18.977 --> 31:20.672
It says you cracked under the strain

31:20.845 --> 31:23.279
of the murder charges
against your son.

31:23.448 --> 31:26.144
You shot T.J.
and now you can't live with it.

31:26.317 --> 31:29.150
- So you decided to kill yourself.
- Where is Alana? What did you do?

31:30.021 --> 31:32.080
It's my get-out-of-jail-free card.

31:32.257 --> 31:34.885
See, you're the only one
who can identify me.

31:35.059 --> 31:37.459
Everyone else,
they've just been seeing double.

31:37.629 --> 31:40.723
- They'll sound crazy.
- I'm not signing a suicide note, Boyd.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.493
- Put Alana on the phone.
- Oh, you'll sign.

31:43.668 --> 31:45.101
Because either I shoot you

31:46.437 --> 31:48.098
or I shoot her.

31:48.273 --> 31:50.036
It's a trade.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.879
Your life for hers.

32:00.218 --> 32:01.412
You know what?

32:01.586 --> 32:04.020
I don't think I can let you do this, Tom.
We need to call Jarvis.

32:04.188 --> 32:06.748
We need to block off the street.
We need to surround your house.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.792
- He has Alana.
- Tom, he wants to kill you.

32:09.961 --> 32:12.395
The least we can do
is make it a little bit difficult for him.

32:12.563 --> 32:14.497
If it was Maia in there,

32:14.666 --> 32:16.725
would you call Jarvis?

32:26.010 --> 32:27.671
Do you like it?

32:28.413 --> 32:30.210
Why did you bring this to me?

32:30.381 --> 32:32.042
You're a young woman.

32:32.216 --> 32:33.979
A young woman
should have a nice dress.

32:35.486 --> 32:38.387
This is gonna look good on you.
See for yourself.

32:48.066 --> 32:49.693
Thank you.

32:51.169 --> 32:54.138
I see you've been
spending a lot of time with Shawn.

32:54.305 --> 32:55.772
So?

32:56.107 --> 32:57.802
Well, I think it's wonderful.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.773
Shawn's a very isolated young man.

32:59.944 --> 33:03.471
He doesn't get to spend much time
around people his own age.

33:05.216 --> 33:06.774
I think

33:07.318 --> 33:09.912
you should get
as close to him as you can.

33:13.624 --> 33:15.114
Matthew?

33:17.161 --> 33:19.061
Shawn's nice.

33:19.230 --> 33:20.822
And what I'm doing with him
is not for you

33:20.999 --> 33:23.126
and it's not because
I'm trying to use him.

33:23.768 --> 33:25.633
Of course not.

33:25.803 --> 33:28.101
But eventually, lsabelle,

33:28.272 --> 33:29.967
you and Shawn
are gonna be on opposite sides

33:30.141 --> 33:32.575
of a very large ideological divide.

33:33.911 --> 33:36.778
So enjoy your friendship.

33:36.948 --> 33:38.745
But don't let your emotions
run too deep.

33:39.384 --> 33:41.352
If you do,

33:41.519 --> 33:43.180
it'll make things more difficult later.

33:45.757 --> 33:48.248
- What things?
- You'll know.

33:51.229 --> 33:52.856
It doesn't match your eyes.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.261
You should take care of that.

34:20.690 --> 34:22.818
You were a beautiful woman.

34:25.329 --> 34:26.956
Both of you.

34:31.369 --> 34:33.667
You looked exactly alike.

34:35.273 --> 34:37.672
I never could figure out why.

34:40.777 --> 34:42.768
But one way or the other,
I've had a Lily in my life

34:42.947 --> 34:44.380
for over 50 years.

34:48.652 --> 34:50.813
That's all gone now.

34:52.690 --> 34:54.214
And I don't know what I'm gonna do.

35:02.233 --> 35:05.498
But it makes me feel better
knowing the two of you are together.

35:06.604 --> 35:08.367
Forever.

35:39.103 --> 35:40.968
This is it for you, you know.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.972
I don't know what kind of fairy tale
the Nova Group sold you,

35:44.142 --> 35:47.407
but it doesn't matter
what happens to me or Tom.

35:47.578 --> 35:50.376
Your life is over.
They sent you on a suicide mission.

35:50.548 --> 35:52.106
I volunteered.

35:52.283 --> 35:55.480
And I don't think you're in any spot
to be giving me advice.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.853
You're a 4400.

35:59.023 --> 36:00.888
You're special.

36:01.058 --> 36:03.026
You're supposed to be
changing things.

36:04.629 --> 36:06.028
Instead you live
with an NTAC agent.

36:06.197 --> 36:08.165
And what are you going to change,
Boyd?

36:08.332 --> 36:09.959
You killed a girl.

36:10.134 --> 36:11.897
How does that
make the world better?

36:12.069 --> 36:14.230
T.J. Kim was a soldier.

36:14.405 --> 36:17.841
She would rather have me
put a bullet in her head than betray us.

36:21.145 --> 36:22.737
Everyone talks
about saving the world.

36:23.814 --> 36:26.908
Meanwhile, for the past 50 years,
everything's been turning bad.

36:27.084 --> 36:28.711
One disaster after another.

36:32.356 --> 36:36.486
But we're gonna show the world
a new way.

36:37.061 --> 36:39.529
We're gonna take them down
a new path.

36:40.364 --> 36:42.798
By force if we have to.

36:44.168 --> 36:45.430
I mean, can't you see?

36:45.603 --> 36:49.130
The real catastrophe
is to sit back and do nothing.

36:54.845 --> 36:56.574
Did you hear that?

37:20.504 --> 37:21.698
Stop it.

37:25.943 --> 37:29.310
- Stop it, both of you. Stop or I'll shoot.
- Nice work, Alana. We got him.

37:29.480 --> 37:30.504
Shut up!

37:30.681 --> 37:33.650
- Alana, Death in Venice.
- Yeah, that's the password.

37:33.818 --> 37:36.787
Come on, Alana. Give me the gun.
We'll call NTAC. It's over.

37:47.865 --> 37:50.095
Alana, it's me, Tom.
Ask me a question. Anything--

37:50.268 --> 37:53.135
Wait, don't fall for it.
He's probably read my file.

37:53.304 --> 37:55.169
He knows everything about us.
Don't listen to him.

37:55.339 --> 37:56.738
Ask me something about us.

37:56.907 --> 37:59.034
Something only I would know.
Anything about us.

37:59.210 --> 38:00.837
Shut up, both of you.

38:01.012 --> 38:05.346
Baby, I am so proud of you.
Billy would have been proud.

38:06.884 --> 38:09.580
- You know about Billy?
- Yeah.

38:09.754 --> 38:12.689
That was your son.
He died in a car accident.

38:12.857 --> 38:16.190
Alana, he did research.
Anyone could find that out.

38:16.360 --> 38:19.193
Give me the gun.
Just give me the gun.

38:19.363 --> 38:20.990
Alana, give me the gun.

38:22.833 --> 38:27.202
- No.
- Alana, give me the gun.

38:28.372 --> 38:31.000
- Come on.
- Get down on the ground.

38:31.776 --> 38:35.041
What? No, no.
You've got the wrong one.

38:35.246 --> 38:37.806
- Think about this.
- I said get down.

38:39.383 --> 38:41.351
Hold still, Boyd.

38:47.258 --> 38:49.055
Don't move.

38:55.299 --> 38:56.561
You're just a boy.

38:58.135 --> 38:59.830
I'm a soldier.

39:00.004 --> 39:02.529
- And there are more of us every day.
- Let's go, soldier.

39:13.884 --> 39:16.444
Hey, welcome back.

39:16.620 --> 39:18.747
- Yeah, thanks.
- Did everything go okay?

39:18.923 --> 39:20.788
Yeah, thank you.

39:20.958 --> 39:23.153
And thank you
for keeping an eye on lsabelle.

39:23.327 --> 39:24.760
Oh, well.

39:24.929 --> 39:27.727
It's not a problem.
I didn't really do much.

39:28.566 --> 39:30.295
Yeah, well, thank you, anyway.

39:31.102 --> 39:32.967
I worry about her.

39:34.939 --> 39:36.429
Well, you don't really need to.

39:36.607 --> 39:38.768
She seems to be getting along
really well.

39:40.177 --> 39:42.236
I'm her father. It's my job.

39:48.185 --> 39:50.483
And it's harder with lsabelle.

39:51.822 --> 39:54.222
People see her, they see a woman.

39:55.092 --> 39:56.582
A beautiful woman.

39:57.928 --> 40:01.261
And they might forget
that inside she's just a little girl.

40:07.638 --> 40:08.969
Still,

40:09.140 --> 40:11.904
I'm glad she has you around,

40:12.076 --> 40:13.873
to be a friend.

41:12.703 --> 41:14.330
Shawn.

41:16.106 --> 41:18.734
- How'd you get in here?
- I can do stuff, remember?

41:20.644 --> 41:22.077
Yeah.

41:23.347 --> 41:25.338
So, what's up? What do you need?

41:29.186 --> 41:31.313
Just one thing.

41:34.625 --> 41:36.422
It's on my list.

41:46.070 --> 41:48.038
First kiss.

41:50.040 --> 41:52.668
This isn't smart, lsabelle.

41:53.744 --> 41:55.507
Okay.
