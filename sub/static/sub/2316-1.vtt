<i>It all started with a secret.
We all have them.</i>

00:28.967 --> 00:31.370
<i>Everyone's is different.</i>

00:31.470 --> 00:33.940
<i>Most secrets don't carry much weight.</i>

00:34.040 --> 00:38.111
<i>But some... some secrets can
destroy everything you love.</i>

02:42.535 --> 02:44.216
Why?

02:44.537 --> 02:46.864
Why, David?

02:48.041 --> 02:49.309
Why?!

03:51.569 --> 03:55.108
Are you watching the sunrise alone?
That's no fun.

03:55.208 --> 03:57.409
No, I was just thinking.

03:57.609 --> 04:00.246
- Are you getting cold feet?
- No.

04:00.346 --> 04:04.150
No, I was just thinking how
lucky I am to have you.

04:05.650 --> 04:08.054
Flattery will get you everywhere.

04:15.194 --> 04:18.096
Do you want to go explore
the city while I find Jill?

04:18.197 --> 04:20.798
No, I'd rather explore you.

04:20.899 --> 04:24.429
We have a tradition, remember?
For every new stamp on the passport,

04:24.529 --> 04:26.372
we need to leave our
mark on the country.

04:26.472 --> 04:27.774
How many stamps do you have now?

04:27.874 --> 04:30.175
Not nearly enough.

04:37.749 --> 04:41.220
I am here today in the depressed area
of Ciudad Bolívar in Bogotá Colombia.

04:41.320 --> 04:45.892
We Colombians are very aware of the difficult
situation these people face every day.

04:45.992 --> 04:50.808
However today there is hope for
the future of Colombia. Our children.

04:50.908 --> 04:54.280
Let's meet some of the people who
have volunteered for this project.

04:54.380 --> 04:56.830
Excuse me, can I ask you a question?
What is your name?

04:56.930 --> 04:59.407
- Yeah, sure. Hi, my name is Jill.
- Are you from Medellín?

04:59.507 --> 05:04.049
Actually I'm from the United States but I'm
spending my summer holidays in Medellín.

05:04.149 --> 05:06.766
Tell me what brought you to
Medellín and then to Bogotá.

05:06.866 --> 05:09.504
When I heard about this project
I wanted to help Bogotá,

05:09.604 --> 05:11.804
which is the town
where my mom grew up.

05:12.384 --> 05:14.694
Thank you so much on
behalf of all the Colombians.

05:14.794 --> 05:16.340
- You're welcome.
- This is Gina Herrera...

05:16.440 --> 05:18.924
reporting live from Ciudad Bolívar...

05:19.024 --> 05:22.768
where we rely not only on
the effort of all Colombians,

05:22.868 --> 05:25.960
but also on very important
international effort.

05:28.734 --> 05:32.004
- That was so cheesy.
- What? What was cheesy?

05:32.104 --> 05:34.774
- "International effort"?
- Well, what is it?

05:34.874 --> 05:37.241
Why don't we interview the girls
who are actually from Medellín?

05:37.341 --> 05:39.841
Why are we focusing
on this skinny "gringa"?

05:41.647 --> 05:46.630
- Look, you can always be sexier. Always.
- Always with the "sexy".

05:56.042 --> 05:58.406
- Do you like it?
- Yes, I love it.

05:58.506 --> 05:59.975
- Do you want one?
- Yes, yes, yes.

06:00.907 --> 06:02.939
Can I get two, please?

06:15.415 --> 06:18.595
No, I'm not laughing at you. I swear.
I'll call you in ten minutes.

06:22.221 --> 06:23.328
Dad!

06:27.327 --> 06:28.495
How did you find me?

06:28.595 --> 06:30.663
I pay your credit-card bills, remember?
I always know where you are.

06:30.763 --> 06:32.132
David, what a surprise.

06:32.232 --> 06:35.002
Gina, you didn't get any of my
voicemail messages, apparently.

06:35.102 --> 06:35.969
Messages? No.

06:36.069 --> 06:38.071
Lauren, this is Gina.
She was Marcela's sister.

06:38.171 --> 06:40.661
- Well, I'm still her sister. How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

06:40.761 --> 06:43.868
David's told me so much about Marcela.
It sounds like she was an amazing woman.

06:43.968 --> 06:45.045
She was.

06:45.145 --> 06:47.647
- You shouldn't have come, dad.
- You think we want to be here?

06:47.747 --> 06:49.616
We have a wedding in eight days.
You're not missing that,

06:49.716 --> 06:51.251
and you're definitely not gonna
miss your freshman year at...

06:51.351 --> 06:52.285
Well, I'm not going home.

06:52.385 --> 06:54.454
Jill, I'm not marrying
David without you there.

06:54.554 --> 06:56.623
- Sure you're not.
- Jill.

06:58.424 --> 07:02.070
- Okay, why don't we relax a little bit?
- Don't tell me to relax, Gina.

07:02.170 --> 07:03.496
You're her aunt. You knew she was
supposed to be home a week ago.

07:03.596 --> 07:05.965
- You could have put her on a plane.
- Okay, don't blame her.

07:06.065 --> 07:08.234
Just grab your stuff.
We're flying out of Bogotá tonight.

07:08.334 --> 07:11.338
No, we're not. My passport's
back at Gina's in Medellín.

07:11.438 --> 07:13.006
- It's true.
- Of course it is.

07:13.106 --> 07:14.708
How far is that?

07:14.808 --> 07:16.542
Hey.

07:16.943 --> 07:19.479
Like six-eight hours driving.

07:19.579 --> 07:21.042
That doesn't sound very good.
Who is this?

07:21.142 --> 07:23.116
Ramon. Raymond.

07:24.084 --> 07:27.686
- My cameraman.
- And... my boyfriend.

07:28.487 --> 07:30.289
That doesn't sound very good, either.

07:34.226 --> 07:37.363
I understand you're angry, but whether
you like it or not, she's 18 now.

07:37.463 --> 07:41.200
She's testing a little bit of independence.
Just give her some space. That's it.

07:41.300 --> 07:43.370
I'll give her space after college.

07:44.470 --> 07:45.971
She's such a great kid.

07:46.071 --> 07:48.807
I just want to make sure I can keep
her close so I can keep an eye on her,

07:48.907 --> 07:51.624
- make sure she's safe. That's all.
- Correct me if I'm wrong.

07:51.724 --> 07:54.611
You went backpacking through Europe
when you were in college, right?

07:54.711 --> 07:57.765
That's when you met Marcela?
Was that safe?

07:57.865 --> 08:00.979
Why would she suddenly want to skip
the wedding? Has she said anything to you?

08:01.479 --> 08:02.750
Yeah.

08:03.623 --> 08:05.325
- And?
- And what?

08:05.425 --> 08:08.826
- What did she say?
- Let's hear it.

08:09.896 --> 08:13.633
Okay. You're on her Facebook as
"a gold-digging bitch marrying my dad."

08:13.733 --> 08:16.369
Why the hell would she
say that? I mean...

08:16.469 --> 08:19.238
No, no, no, no. I completely get it.

08:19.338 --> 08:22.575
I'm not trying to replace Marcela,
and I never will.

08:26.279 --> 08:27.514
Gina, make him stop.

08:27.614 --> 08:31.751
- Why is he still with us?
- Relax a little bit, please. I told you.

08:31.851 --> 08:35.288
He's my cameraman. He's a good guy.
He's just her summer boyfriend.

08:35.388 --> 08:38.591
What's all the fuzz about? Of course,
that's what my sister said about you at first.

08:38.691 --> 08:42.662
That's what I'm worried about. I don't
want her having babies at 18 like us.

08:42.761 --> 08:44.813
Come on. She won't, believe me.

08:47.099 --> 08:49.035
Okay, remember that trip to Vegas?

08:49.135 --> 08:52.638
You and Marcela were taking shrooms.
You used to do that, right?

08:52.738 --> 08:54.340
- No.
- Yeah, right.

08:54.940 --> 08:57.143
- No, I wasn't.
- I bet you do.

08:57.243 --> 09:00.146
And my sister went all crazy
about the park buses.

09:00.246 --> 09:04.817
You know what? That's exactly what
Jill needs to keep her spirit alive.

09:04.917 --> 09:05.836
She wants to talk about her.

09:05.936 --> 09:08.321
She says you don't talk about
her anymore. It's important for her.

09:08.421 --> 09:10.957
Gina, are you sure this road is safe?
Isn't Farc around here?

09:11.057 --> 09:13.526
Farc? No, no. No,
we've gotten rid of most of them?

09:13.626 --> 09:14.527
"Most"?

09:14.927 --> 09:16.663
What the fuck happened?

09:16.763 --> 09:19.623
- Sorry, sorry.
- Welcome to Colombia.

09:21.694 --> 09:25.138
Gina, why don't you let... David drive
for a bit so you can have a rest?

09:25.438 --> 09:27.407
- Do you want me to?
- I don't mind.

09:27.507 --> 09:28.368
Okay.

09:30.675 --> 09:34.080
Fancy wedding? Sounds like
business is going well. I'm glad.

09:34.180 --> 09:36.616
Better to be the agency owner
than another photo journalist

09:36.716 --> 09:37.850
slugging it through war zones.

09:37.950 --> 09:39.652
- Have you seen his pictures?
- Yeah.

09:39.752 --> 09:41.220
Your book was fantastic.

09:41.320 --> 09:44.390
I mean, it's one of the best I've
ever seen in my life, I swear.

09:44.890 --> 09:47.326
Your sister used to tell me I spent
too much time documenting

09:47.426 --> 09:50.230
life and not enough time living it,
so I'm working on that.

09:50.330 --> 09:52.732
- Good.
- I like your bracelet.

09:52.832 --> 09:53.666
Really?

09:53.766 --> 09:55.768
- Here. You can have it.
- Don't be silly.

09:55.868 --> 09:58.338
It's a gift. At least you'll have
something to remember from my country.

09:58.438 --> 09:59.886
Thank you.

10:00.872 --> 10:02.386
There you go.

10:03.009 --> 10:06.045
- Is it okay if I smoke?
- Give me one.

10:06.145 --> 10:09.982
No, no, no, no.
No one's smoking, okay? Sorry.

10:10.282 --> 10:13.486
And, Jill, please speak English so Lauren
and I can join in the conversation.

10:14.387 --> 10:16.417
Oh, shit.

10:22.527 --> 10:25.227
- Can you grab my passport out of my bag?
- Yeah.

10:33.505 --> 10:34.874
- Good day.
- Good day.

10:34.974 --> 10:37.476
- Good day.
- You can't drive through here.

10:37.776 --> 10:41.580
Yes... Where is Connecticut?

10:43.550 --> 10:45.622
- Medell... Medellín?
- What?

10:45.722 --> 10:47.486
- Where are you going?
- Connecticut.

10:47.586 --> 10:49.455
He asked where we're going,
not where we're from.

10:49.555 --> 10:51.970
- We're going to Medellín, sir.
- This isn't the way to Medellín.

10:52.070 --> 10:54.183
You'll only come across floods
and landslides on this road.

10:54.283 --> 10:56.129
- What'd he say?
- Flash floods.

10:56.229 --> 11:00.233
That's right. You need to get on the
main road, about 20 km kilometers back.

11:00.333 --> 11:01.367
He wants us to turn around.

11:01.467 --> 11:05.135
We're going to Medellín. We're running late.
Can't we just go straight?

11:05.235 --> 11:07.235
- I'm not familiar with this road.
- That's not a good idea.

11:08.106 --> 11:11.139
Okay. Okay. Okay, we'll turn around then.
Thank you very much.

11:11.239 --> 11:13.771
- You'll be careful, right?
- Yes, sir. Thank you.

11:16.114 --> 11:17.884
You know what? He's wrong. He's wrong.

11:17.984 --> 11:20.720
He's a local. I know this.
I know this road perfectly.

11:20.820 --> 11:24.691
We should find the main road
like in about 10, 12 miles.

11:24.991 --> 11:27.961
- You sure?
- Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure. Let's go.

11:33.065 --> 11:35.601
Why would you let Jill go
anywhere without her passport?

11:35.701 --> 11:37.169
Now we might not make our flight.

11:37.269 --> 11:39.038
- Where's the main road?
- It should be coming up.

11:39.138 --> 11:40.753
You said that half an hour ago.

11:43.109 --> 11:47.867
- Is there a map in the glove box?
- David! David, watch! D-David!

11:49.982 --> 11:53.085
Jesus! It's okay. Everything's okay.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.487
Shit. Come on.

12:00.725 --> 12:03.629
- We're gonna have to get out and push.
- Slowly, slowly, slowly.

12:04.097 --> 12:06.465
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

12:31.556 --> 12:33.853
Lauren! You okay?

12:35.027 --> 12:36.446
Jill!

12:38.430 --> 12:40.233
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You okay?

12:40.333 --> 12:42.909
- Ramon?
- Come on.

12:44.036 --> 12:46.172
We have to call an ambulance.

12:47.540 --> 12:49.062
I'm okay.

12:50.810 --> 12:53.580
I have no signal.
There's no signal here.

12:55.881 --> 12:58.718
Here. Grab some warm
clothes and hold up, okay?

12:59.318 --> 13:03.222
There's a path that leads
to a house. Come on!

13:03.522 --> 13:05.305
Okay. Shit.

13:05.405 --> 13:08.729
Okay, okay, everybody just stay calm,
all right? We're gonna get through this.

13:44.282 --> 13:45.552
Shit.

13:47.209 --> 13:49.317
- Hello?
- Hello?

13:50.294 --> 13:52.195
- Hello?
- Help.

13:52.295 --> 13:54.020
- Hello?
- Help.

13:54.120 --> 13:56.620
- We need help.
- Help!

13:56.720 --> 13:58.772
- Help!
- Hello?

13:58.872 --> 14:01.546
- Accident, please...
- The inn is closed.

14:01.646 --> 14:05.082
No guests allowed. There's a
town nearby, you can walk there.

14:05.182 --> 14:06.782
We can't walk.

14:06.885 --> 14:10.478
It's okay. She... she won't
make it into town. She's hurt.

14:10.578 --> 14:12.925
You have to let us in, please!
<i>Por favor!</i>

14:13.125 --> 14:14.958
Help us.

14:15.325 --> 14:17.405
Please, help us.

14:18.326 --> 14:22.597
- Your daughter?
- Yes. <i>Sí mi hija</i>. This is my daughter.

14:22.868 --> 14:25.004
This is my family. Please.

14:25.304 --> 14:28.095
- Family?
- Yes. Please.

14:28.195 --> 14:29.921
Please.

14:32.311 --> 14:34.874
- Thank you.
<i>- Gracias</i>. Thank you. Come on.

14:48.659 --> 14:50.728
Let's get you over to the couch.

14:56.134 --> 14:57.383
Okay?

14:58.705 --> 15:00.840
- Fuck.
- You okay?

15:01.640 --> 15:02.666
Yeah.

15:04.166 --> 15:05.822
Towels.

15:06.512 --> 15:09.296
- Towels.
- Yes. Please.

15:14.319 --> 15:16.467
I just have to take my jacket off.

15:19.725 --> 15:22.358
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

15:23.829 --> 15:25.983
Thank you, sir. Okay.

15:33.471 --> 15:34.954
Thank you.

15:37.209 --> 15:41.112
I'm David. This is my fiancé, Lauren.

15:41.547 --> 15:44.500
Jill, Ramon, and Gina.

15:44.817 --> 15:46.252
Felipe.

15:46.852 --> 15:48.988
Ask him if he has a cellphone.

15:49.088 --> 15:51.340
Do you have a phone or
a cellphone we can use?

15:51.440 --> 15:55.203
There are no cellphones here.
No landline phones either.

15:59.431 --> 16:00.666
How you holding up?

16:00.766 --> 16:03.382
Oh, I'm great. It's been
a great holiday so far.

16:04.136 --> 16:08.141
I know you're concerned, but I'm just gonna
do a self-exam and I'll let you know, okay?

16:09.141 --> 16:10.643
You've got a cut on your eye.

16:11.667 --> 16:14.979
I'll be okay. There goes
our wedding pictures, right?

16:18.550 --> 16:20.519
Could I get a-a glass of water?

16:22.069 --> 16:24.344
Could you bring us a
glass of water, please?

16:46.645 --> 16:47.910
Thank you.

16:55.211 --> 16:57.827
This doesn't protect you.

17:19.310 --> 17:22.851
Guy's creepy. He just told me my
mom's rosary won't protect me.

17:26.019 --> 17:27.837
- What do you mean?
- Thanks.

17:27.936 --> 17:32.566
- Protect you from what?
- I don't know. That's what he told me.

17:38.929 --> 17:41.133
Do you have any
wood for the fireplace?

17:41.233 --> 17:43.233
- Wood, Felipe?
- Yes.

17:44.136 --> 17:46.016
I can get it for you.

17:46.640 --> 17:50.509
Don't leave. Everyone stay here.

17:50.609 --> 17:54.952
He doesn't want us to go.
You go. I'll stay with Lauren.

18:28.989 --> 18:30.823
Gallows Hill.

18:35.653 --> 18:37.390
- Gallows Hill.
- What?

18:37.490 --> 18:40.226
- This was a hotel.
- This was a hotel?

18:40.715 --> 18:41.856
What's this?

18:41.956 --> 18:45.869
The last guest registry is
from December 14th 1978.

18:53.432 --> 18:56.199
Not a single guest in 30 years?

18:59.024 --> 19:01.207
- Ramon.
- Look.

19:05.454 --> 19:06.896
- This has been cut.
- No.

19:06.996 --> 19:08.457
- Yes.
- No.

19:08.557 --> 19:12.334
That man didn't pay the phone bill,
so he just... cut it off.

19:13.024 --> 19:15.320
It's probably just an old phone.

19:16.295 --> 19:19.387
It's probably just an old phone.
You're right.

19:27.939 --> 19:29.908
I have to go to the bathroom.

19:30.508 --> 19:32.951
Wait. I really think we should
stick together. Don't leave.

19:33.051 --> 19:34.612
- Lauren.
- Please.

19:34.712 --> 19:36.348
I've been holding it since
the car, okay? I have to go.

19:36.448 --> 19:40.150
- I'll stay with you, Lauren.
- Okay, hurry back, please.

19:41.759 --> 19:43.426
I'll go with her.

19:46.424 --> 19:49.130
- Would you mind if I have a look?
- Yeah.

19:51.831 --> 19:55.166
Oh, shit. You should get
some x-rays right now.

19:55.266 --> 19:57.036
They're only gonna tell me
that I've got two broken ribs.

19:57.136 --> 19:59.475
- Are you sure? 'Cause it looks bad.
- I'm a nurse, Gina.

19:59.575 --> 20:02.374
- I know what broken ribs feel like.
- Okay.

20:02.474 --> 20:04.920
We should have listened
to the captain. This is...

20:05.544 --> 20:08.713
So, you get a good look?

20:14.020 --> 20:15.187
What?

20:15.288 --> 20:18.846
Come on. I saw you
looking at my aunt's tits.

20:20.459 --> 20:23.439
So now you want to speak English.

20:25.531 --> 20:26.991
Okay.

20:28.968 --> 20:30.985
Our car is wrecked.

20:32.138 --> 20:34.031
Lauren is injured.

20:35.674 --> 20:38.344
And we're trapped in a house...

20:39.245 --> 20:41.414
with a psycho killer.

20:43.515 --> 20:46.918
And you're worried that I
was admiring Gina's tits?

21:00.098 --> 21:02.072
You love me.

21:49.782 --> 21:51.918
Shut up, you moron.

21:52.018 --> 21:55.187
Hey, I was thinking.

21:56.088 --> 21:59.091
Maybe make sense for
you to go home now.

22:02.128 --> 22:03.462
Be nice.

22:04.063 --> 22:07.083
- Let him win this one.
- Be quiet.

22:13.274 --> 22:14.592
Help me.

22:14.874 --> 22:18.274
There's a little girl there. Come!

22:21.246 --> 22:22.246
Listen.

22:24.417 --> 22:26.484
We need to find her.

22:38.668 --> 22:40.692
- Where are the others?
- They went to look for a bathroom.

22:40.792 --> 22:43.458
I told you to stay here.

22:43.968 --> 22:46.104
What is wrong with him?

22:46.805 --> 22:49.196
- Where's Jill?
- She went looking for a bathroom.

22:58.583 --> 23:01.276
Jill. I don't know about this.

23:01.376 --> 23:03.313
Where are you?

23:04.823 --> 23:06.560
Here. Here.

23:35.107 --> 23:37.506
Mr. Felipe we don't
want to bother you...

23:37.606 --> 23:41.920
we are actually very grateful
to you for letting us in.

23:42.020 --> 23:43.469
I'm sure they'll be back soon.

24:07.452 --> 24:09.476
We have to go down there.

24:11.723 --> 24:13.268
Help me.

24:32.210 --> 24:34.244
Ramon, come on.

25:35.740 --> 25:39.265
What is this? A bathroom?

25:42.714 --> 25:46.378
What the hell? Is he living here?

25:46.885 --> 25:48.866
I don't like this, Jill.

25:56.494 --> 25:57.972
Oh, my God.

26:28.243 --> 26:29.755
Hello.

26:32.003 --> 26:33.403
What is your name?

26:34.699 --> 26:36.127
Ana Maria.

26:37.426 --> 26:39.381
My name is Jill.

26:40.413 --> 26:43.179
Who locked you in here Ana Maria?

26:43.975 --> 26:45.630
Felipe?

26:46.830 --> 26:48.168
Yes.

26:53.166 --> 26:56.265
We are getting you out of here. Okay?

27:05.007 --> 27:06.352
Stop right there!

27:07.207 --> 27:11.106
- For God's sake. Stop.
- Calm down, calm down.

27:11.906 --> 27:15.756
The Lord is with you.
If you touch her, you will die.

27:15.856 --> 27:18.244
- We didn't see anything.
- What are you talk...

27:18.344 --> 27:22.277
You've seen too much and
you know too much already.

27:22.377 --> 27:24.804
You crazy fuck!
She's just a little girl!

27:26.751 --> 27:29.154
What the hell you doing down here?
Why'd he have a gun on you?

27:29.254 --> 27:32.124
Dad, he's got a little girl in there.
We have to get her out.

27:32.224 --> 27:33.518
What?

27:36.028 --> 27:37.557
Look.

27:53.644 --> 27:56.223
- Point this at the lock.
- Okay.

28:21.839 --> 28:23.612
Jesus.

28:26.260 --> 28:28.543
- Oh, my God.
- Put her down.

28:30.315 --> 28:31.856
- Who is she?
- Her name's Ana Maria.

28:31.956 --> 28:34.461
- Felipe had her locked in the basement.
- What?

28:35.688 --> 28:37.230
Oh, my God.

28:37.330 --> 28:39.432
- What happened?
- He had a gun pointed at Jill.

28:39.532 --> 28:41.531
- What? Are you okay?
- Yeah.

28:41.631 --> 28:44.141
We should tie him up in the
other room. Give me a hand.

28:49.233 --> 28:50.769
This is unbelievable.

28:50.869 --> 28:53.115
I want to go to the basement.
Where's the camera, Ramon?

28:53.215 --> 28:54.795
It's in the van.

28:55.601 --> 28:58.022
- I need the camera anyway.
- Gina.

28:58.122 --> 28:59.777
What? I'm gonna check the box, okay?

28:59.877 --> 29:01.947
Gina, we don't know what else is
down there. We should stick together.

29:02.047 --> 29:03.382
I'll be fine.

29:08.586 --> 29:09.821
Check to see if he has a car.

29:10.321 --> 29:12.900
- Automobile. You understand?
- Yeah, a car.

29:16.361 --> 29:18.909
Jill, don't go far. I may need you.

29:19.230 --> 29:21.566
I want to ask him some
questions when he wakes up.

29:24.135 --> 29:26.838
I'm so sorry that this
has happened to you.

29:26.938 --> 29:29.761
But we will take care of
you and get you help.

29:31.977 --> 29:34.670
It's okay. It's okay.

29:36.481 --> 29:38.124
Where is your mama?

29:39.284 --> 29:40.650
Felipe.

29:40.751 --> 29:43.621
Don't worry. I won't let him near you.

29:43.721 --> 29:46.660
We can't leave yet,
but we'll find a way out of here.

29:47.659 --> 29:52.468
You hungry? Okay. Gina! Jill?

29:54.365 --> 29:55.867
Stay there.

29:55.967 --> 29:58.848
Gina? Jill!

30:16.478 --> 30:20.373
Mother of God... this is wrong.

30:35.272 --> 30:37.573
This is where Ana Maria
was held captive.

30:37.973 --> 30:40.163
It's a wooden box...

30:40.463 --> 30:45.317
of about 9 feet wide and 5 feet high.

30:46.635 --> 30:48.945
There's a very strong smell.

30:52.720 --> 30:55.170
Here we have some inscriptions...

30:55.270 --> 30:57.270
We don't know if Ana Maria
is the only one here.

30:57.370 --> 31:00.112
We don't know if there's anybody else.
We don't know why.

31:10.636 --> 31:12.654
What a hideous doll.

31:19.210 --> 31:20.871
Fucking gross.

31:41.839 --> 31:43.099
Ana Maria.

31:46.913 --> 31:49.383
You fool! Idiot!

31:49.483 --> 31:51.850
I told you I don't
speak Spanish. Jill!

31:52.450 --> 31:55.665
- Now! When we still...
- I don't speak Spanish!

31:55.765 --> 31:57.155
What'd you do to the little girl?

31:57.255 --> 32:00.356
She becomes stronger every
time she's not in the box.

32:01.501 --> 32:04.233
We still have a chance!

32:06.078 --> 32:08.466
- You have no idea of who she is.
- Jill!

32:09.591 --> 32:11.535
She's evil.

32:12.367 --> 32:15.353
You have to help me take
her back to the box.

32:15.453 --> 32:18.258
- Idiot.
- Jill, I need you now!

32:18.658 --> 32:21.196
She's killed her family.
We're all going to die.

32:21.696 --> 32:24.049
- What's he saying?
- He said we're all gonna die.

32:25.201 --> 32:28.128
You're going to regret this, I swear.

32:28.631 --> 32:30.428
If you don't untie me...

32:32.257 --> 32:34.319
Ana Maria?

33:40.224 --> 33:42.125
Ana Maria?

34:32.743 --> 34:34.868
Ana Maria!

35:25.220 --> 35:26.855
Open the door.

35:27.198 --> 35:29.967
Ana Maria, I need you
to open the door.

35:32.437 --> 35:33.438
Ana Maria!

35:57.929 --> 36:02.447
Open your eyes, Dad.
Or I'll cut off your eyelids.

36:12.840 --> 36:15.386
Leave those people alone.

36:15.486 --> 36:19.063
But they're here to
protect me from you.

36:19.463 --> 36:22.995
- Isn't that sweet.
- Take me instead.

36:24.527 --> 36:28.595
Which one is stronger?
David or Ramón?

36:31.299 --> 36:34.555
Shut up! Always praying.

36:34.855 --> 36:36.873
Just like Inés.

36:36.973 --> 36:40.373
She spent all day praying too
and that didn't help her.

36:44.811 --> 36:48.757
I'm free again. Goodbye, Dad.

36:51.970 --> 36:55.046
"Lead us not into temptation,

36:55.923 --> 36:58.675
deliver us from evil".

37:12.202 --> 37:15.605
Come on, come on!

37:27.867 --> 37:29.317
Shit!

37:57.214 --> 37:59.052
Ana Maria!

38:00.077 --> 38:02.732
What are you doing there, sweetie?
Come with me.

38:09.126 --> 38:13.667
- Has anyone seen Ana Maria?
- I thought she was with you. You okay?

38:15.733 --> 38:18.870
Ramon is getting Felipe's car.
We're getting the hell out of here.

38:21.572 --> 38:23.507
Why'd you take her outside?

38:23.707 --> 38:26.117
She was there alone. I don't know why.

38:27.461 --> 38:29.274
That's your doll, right?

38:30.615 --> 38:34.550
Can you tell me her name? Do you want
me to ask her what happened down there?

38:34.651 --> 38:36.520
Gina, what are you doing?

38:36.620 --> 38:38.322
Trying to find out what the
hell happened down there.

38:38.422 --> 38:42.093
What matters is that we get Lauren and Ana
Maria to the doctor, okay? Put that away.

38:42.193 --> 38:43.893
Nobody's going anywhere.

38:45.095 --> 38:48.265
- The old man's car is destroyed.
- Can it be fixed?

38:48.365 --> 38:50.134
Felipe has to have some
kind of transportation.

38:50.234 --> 38:52.103
I mean, he can't survive in the
middle of nowhere without one.

38:52.203 --> 38:53.738
I'll get him talking.

38:56.541 --> 38:57.934
Did you hear that?

38:59.210 --> 39:00.278
Yeah.

39:11.254 --> 39:12.495
What was that?

39:13.551 --> 39:15.780
God, forgive me.

39:28.738 --> 39:31.595
- I-I-I...
- It's okay. It's okay.

39:34.612 --> 39:36.553
David, look at his wrist.

39:47.023 --> 39:49.856
He slashed his wrist
before he attacked us.

39:50.661 --> 39:53.480
Dad? Dad, what's going on?

40:12.238 --> 40:15.094
Why would he kill himself if he
was going to kill us, anyway?

40:15.379 --> 40:18.136
And why would he kill himself
before attacking us? Why not after?

40:18.236 --> 40:21.192
Besides he was coming right to us,
not you. You understand?

40:21.292 --> 40:26.902
Leave me alone. Please,
stop talking about this. Stop!

41:17.246 --> 41:19.429
Everything's gonna be okay.

41:20.484 --> 41:23.120
Look, we need to get
Ana Maria to a doctor.

41:23.220 --> 41:26.524
I have no idea how bad those
injuries might be, and...

41:26.624 --> 41:28.807
So when... when the storm lets up,

41:28.907 --> 41:32.043
leave us here and you and
Ramon need to hike into town.

41:32.143 --> 41:33.865
What about you?

41:34.265 --> 41:35.701
I'll be fine.

41:36.333 --> 41:41.004
Look, if my dad has to push me
in a wheelchair down the aisle,

41:41.104 --> 41:43.273
we are still getting married.

41:48.523 --> 41:50.282
What's your doll's name?

41:57.578 --> 41:59.055
Don't do that.

42:00.799 --> 42:02.857
You have a strong body.

42:05.905 --> 42:07.352
You've got to stop.

42:13.536 --> 42:15.944
Okay. All right.

42:18.909 --> 42:20.216
- Dad.
- Yeah?

42:20.316 --> 42:22.027
I need you.

42:33.156 --> 42:35.125
Dad, there's something
wrong with this place.

42:35.225 --> 42:37.895
Why are all the phone lines cut?
What was he trying to hide?

42:37.995 --> 42:40.298
What's he trying to hide?
That he's a pedophile, Jill.

42:40.398 --> 42:42.299
I don't think that's it.

42:42.399 --> 42:46.303
Look, that box looked like it hadn't
been opened in a long, long time.

42:46.403 --> 42:48.539
How'd she stay alive in there?

42:48.639 --> 42:51.142
Well, I guess he shoved food under it.

42:51.242 --> 42:54.478
Where? It was sealed shut.

42:58.047 --> 43:00.831
Okay. Let's take another
look at that box.

43:08.895 --> 43:11.104
I find myself with the victim.

43:11.204 --> 43:14.436
Ana Maria, tell us how long Felipe had
you locked in that box in the basement.

43:14.536 --> 43:16.433
Gina. What are you doing?

43:16.533 --> 43:19.603
I need her side of the story.
Okay, this is amazing, Lauren.

43:19.703 --> 43:22.006
This is crazy. This might be
also healing for her, you know?

43:22.106 --> 43:24.821
Ana, tell us how long
were you locked in.

43:24.921 --> 43:26.910
She doesn't want to talk,
so stop filming her.

43:27.010 --> 43:29.449
And don't bullshit me that
this might be therapeutic.

43:37.086 --> 43:40.058
I'm gonna bring you
some more ice, okay?

43:41.759 --> 43:44.381
- Thank you.
- Sure.

44:15.105 --> 44:18.784
Anita. You almost gave me heart attack.
What are you doing here?

44:22.612 --> 44:27.172
Honey, that cellphone is very expensive.
Don't play with it. Can I have it back?

44:27.472 --> 44:28.783
Can I ask you a question?

44:30.240 --> 44:33.120
Now you're going to ask me.
Are you going to interview me?

44:33.788 --> 44:35.516
Okay, go ahead.

44:35.916 --> 44:37.628
Who is Trevor?

44:39.537 --> 44:41.362
He's my boss.

44:41.662 --> 44:43.294
Did Ramon tell you about him?

44:45.268 --> 44:47.679
Your boss is very handsome, right?

44:48.756 --> 44:50.998
That's what they say. Yes.

44:52.149 --> 44:54.546
Does he know that you killed his baby?

44:56.729 --> 44:58.203
What did you say?

44:58.303 --> 45:01.591
Just because it could
interfere with your success.

45:04.216 --> 45:07.384
Trevor will be furious when
he knows what you did.

45:07.784 --> 45:09.999
He won't agree with your decision.

45:10.199 --> 45:12.540
- He'll call you a monster.
- Stop it!

45:32.916 --> 45:35.321
Are you proud of yourself?

45:38.712 --> 45:40.624
Your baby wants to know.

45:41.833 --> 45:44.001
Answer, you selfish whore.

46:18.214 --> 46:22.053
I've seen this symbol.
It's in Felipe's journal.

46:22.553 --> 46:25.578
- What does it mean?
- I don't know.

46:27.490 --> 46:29.860
It looks like some kind of language.

46:31.261 --> 46:34.898
Ana Maria couldn't have
written that. It's too high.

46:41.437 --> 46:43.642
That poor girl.

46:49.012 --> 46:51.113
Let's get out of here.

46:57.220 --> 46:58.188
Who is that?

46:58.288 --> 47:01.723
Whoever it is,
they've been dead for a long time.

47:36.326 --> 47:38.446
Some writing on it.

47:39.663 --> 47:42.701
- It's in Spanish.
- Here.

47:45.423 --> 47:50.654
"For my beautiful wife, Inés,
the love of my life. Felipe".

47:52.108 --> 47:56.912
That was his wife. It says
she was the love of his life.

47:57.914 --> 48:00.283
Then why did he kill her?

48:26.776 --> 48:29.044
We think he's living down here.

48:51.133 --> 48:53.101
Look at this.

48:57.239 --> 49:01.145
- Is that Ana Maria?
- Looks like her.

49:02.846 --> 49:04.956
1978?

49:05.356 --> 49:09.419
- Dad, that's not possible.
- She'd be almost 40 years old now.

49:09.519 --> 49:10.921
We need to talk to Ana Maria.

49:11.021 --> 49:13.086
- David!
- Jesus.

49:14.824 --> 49:16.593
- What the hell happened?
- Gina.

49:17.393 --> 49:18.395
Is she okay?!

49:18.495 --> 49:22.433
I just found them like this. Gina was
on the floor, and Ana Maria was dead.

49:22.633 --> 49:26.362
- Ana Maria, listen to me. Ana Maria.
- Somebody slashed her throat.

49:26.462 --> 49:28.106
- What... what happened?
- Gina.

49:29.773 --> 49:31.374
Come on. Wake up.

49:31.474 --> 49:33.431
What happened?! Who did this?!

49:45.154 --> 49:48.459
- Someone's here in the house.
- You saw someone?

49:48.559 --> 49:52.241
No, but I felt, like, an electric shock,
like a taser, and...

49:52.341 --> 49:55.565
and I can't remember anything else.
Then you guys found me. That's all.

49:55.665 --> 49:58.268
All right. From now on,
we stay together.

49:58.368 --> 49:59.837
Storm will let up in the morning.
We'll leave then.

49:59.937 --> 50:03.273
- No. We need to get out of here right now.
- We stay here, and we stay together.

50:03.373 --> 50:05.395
I need to get out of here right now.

50:05.495 --> 50:07.777
For all we know, Felipe could be
hiding an accomplice somewhere.

50:07.877 --> 50:09.413
Gina's right, David. Look,
if there's someone else here...

50:09.513 --> 50:11.982
No, it's better to stay in the house than
wander around in the storm outside.

50:12.082 --> 50:14.251
- It's gonna get dark soon.
- Guys, I don't know.

50:14.351 --> 50:19.121
All I know is that little girl scared the
shit out of me, okay? I'm glad she's dead.

50:19.221 --> 50:21.792
How can you say that?
She was just an abused little girl.

50:21.892 --> 50:25.563
You think so? Felipe didn't seem angry
when we let her out of the box.

50:25.663 --> 50:29.833
He seemed terrified. And then he told
me that my rosary wouldn't protect me?

50:29.933 --> 50:33.070
Protect me from what? And what about
those ancient markings inside the box?

50:33.170 --> 50:35.172
- What did they mean?
- This is ridiculous.

50:35.272 --> 50:40.327
Dad. Dad, come on. You saw that photo.

50:41.110 --> 50:44.749
Doesn't take a box like that to
lock up an ordinary little girl.

50:44.849 --> 50:47.240
- Isn't that right?
- What photo?

50:58.227 --> 51:00.717
- What is this?
- Look at the date.

51:04.067 --> 51:06.136
- That can't be her.
- Looks just like her.

51:06.236 --> 51:10.111
This is impossible.
You've all lost your minds.

51:12.409 --> 51:13.599
I don't know what's going on here,

51:13.699 --> 51:17.006
but all this shit started happening
when we let Ana Maria out of the box.

51:17.948 --> 51:20.063
All I care about now is getting
the five of us out of here safely,

51:20.163 --> 51:23.276
so we leave in the morning. Here.

51:23.376 --> 51:26.863
Keep an eye on them.
Make sure nothing else happens.

51:27.090 --> 51:29.896
I'm gonna go take care
of Ana Maria's body.

51:54.317 --> 51:56.595
Who did this to you?

52:56.112 --> 52:57.715
You okay?

52:58.215 --> 53:00.865
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

53:01.785 --> 53:06.089
Okay, no, you know what? I won't stay
here doing nothing. Give me your cellphone.

53:08.492 --> 53:10.531
- There's no signal.
- I'll find it.

53:11.561 --> 53:13.181
- Hey. Where you going?
- I'm getting us out of here.

53:13.281 --> 53:16.124
No, wait. Gina. Gina! You go with her.

53:17.435 --> 53:21.182
Hey. You stay with me in case
there's someone in the house, okay?

53:24.974 --> 53:27.934
- What? What's wrong?
- Dad. Dad, I saw someone outside.

53:28.879 --> 53:30.285
Stay here.

53:45.729 --> 53:48.490
- Stop! Stop right there.
- Jesus!

53:48.699 --> 53:50.692
- Thank God it's you.
- Let go of the knife.

53:50.792 --> 53:52.905
- You pulled us over on the road, remember?
- Let go of the knife!

53:53.005 --> 53:54.438
- What?
- Let go of the knife!

53:54.538 --> 53:57.040
- Listen, we got into an accident in our car.
- Where is Felipe?

53:57.140 --> 54:00.321
- Our car. We had to walk here. What?
- Shut up! Where is Felipe?

54:00.744 --> 54:02.878
- Felipe is...
- Inside. Let's go!

54:02.979 --> 54:04.581
- My daughter! She speaks Spanish!
- Let's go!

54:04.681 --> 54:07.597
- She can explain, okay? Okay, wait, wait.
- Go!

54:11.554 --> 54:15.692
Felipe! Felipe, it's me,
Captain Morales.

54:15.792 --> 54:17.298
Jill!

54:20.029 --> 54:22.836
- Oh, my God.
- Don't move. Don't move.

54:22.999 --> 54:24.367
- Let's go with him.
- Come on, come on.

54:24.467 --> 54:27.059
Just explain to him
what happened, okay?

54:28.219 --> 54:31.198
- Where is Felipe?
- Felipe is gone, Captain.

54:31.298 --> 54:35.145
- What do you mean? Where did he go?
- He wants to know where Felipe is.

54:35.545 --> 54:37.547
- Where is he?
- Okay! Wait!

54:37.647 --> 54:41.552
- I'll show you.
- Let's go! Let's go. Go!

54:43.453 --> 54:44.874
Move.

54:45.455 --> 54:47.014
Quickly.

54:52.494 --> 54:55.373
He had a little girl in a box.
He tried to attack us.

54:56.766 --> 54:58.702
- Just tell him what happened!
- We can explain it.

54:58.802 --> 55:01.403
He had her locked in the basement and
he attacked us when we let her out.

55:01.503 --> 55:04.905
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
- Captain, he attacked us.

55:05.866 --> 55:08.513
- You let her out?!
- That wasn't us!

55:08.613 --> 55:13.645
To the basement right now!
Right now! Go or I shoot! Go!

55:15.318 --> 55:17.586
Let's go! Quickly!

55:21.980 --> 55:24.920
Open the door! Open the door!

55:27.964 --> 55:30.900
Okay, get in. Get in. Get in, I say!

55:31.000 --> 55:32.736
- Don't touch her!
- Stop right there.

55:32.836 --> 55:36.139
Don't move. Everybody,
come on! Let's go.

55:36.239 --> 55:38.975
- Do what he says.
- Let's go.

55:39.375 --> 55:40.977
- Jesus.
- Quickly.

55:42.579 --> 55:44.105
Go!

55:55.237 --> 55:57.724
- Anything?
- Nothing.

55:57.824 --> 56:01.362
- Where is the other woman?
- Gina? She left after the accident.

56:01.462 --> 56:02.665
She looked for help!

56:02.765 --> 56:04.100
- Go in. Go in.
- No.

56:04.200 --> 56:07.104
Don't go anywhere. Listen to me.
You have to listen to us.

56:07.504 --> 56:09.172
Why are you so scared? It's just us.

56:09.272 --> 56:11.957
- Go. Go in! Go in! Go in!
- David!

56:20.749 --> 56:23.627
Fuck! Fuck!

56:24.027 --> 56:26.227
It's okay, let's go inside.

56:34.997 --> 56:37.135
Let him go.

56:37.835 --> 56:42.233
I am very cold.
Why don't you warm me up?

56:44.053 --> 56:49.041
- Let's go downstairs.
- But why? Don't you feel like it?

56:49.845 --> 56:52.082
Is there anyone else with you?

56:52.735 --> 56:55.345
Why did you panic when
you saw Ana Maria's body?

56:55.445 --> 56:58.563
- Answer her.
- After you go in the box,

56:58.663 --> 57:02.009
- I will answer any questions you have.
- Like hell we're going in there.

57:04.093 --> 57:06.629
Jill, take Lauren upstairs.
Find Gina and Ramon.

57:06.729 --> 57:08.665
We're taking his truck and
getting out of here. Come on.

57:08.765 --> 57:11.360
Let's go. Get in the box.
Come on. Now. In the box.

57:12.976 --> 57:15.483
I know you're sad
about Felipe, I know...

57:16.751 --> 57:19.199
but he's not the first
person you've killed.

57:24.471 --> 57:26.523
You seduce them...

57:27.562 --> 57:29.888
You make them fall in
love with you, right?

57:31.277 --> 57:33.874
And when they're very much in love...

57:35.329 --> 57:37.634
you fill their stomachs with drugs.

57:38.895 --> 57:40.090
Get in.

57:42.566 --> 57:47.696
Listen, you went in the box.
I trust you. Your family is in danger.

57:47.796 --> 57:49.206
- Why?
- She's out.

57:49.306 --> 57:51.842
Who? Felipe's daughter?

57:52.643 --> 57:55.244
- She's dead.
- She is not dead.

57:55.344 --> 57:58.148
- She's not even a little girl.
- What are you talking about?

57:58.248 --> 58:00.651
Who was with Ana Maria when she died?

58:00.751 --> 58:03.153
- Gina and Lauren.
- Where are they now?

58:03.653 --> 58:04.788
What does that matter?

58:04.888 --> 58:07.524
Because one of them is
not your family anymore.

58:07.624 --> 58:09.816
How do you know that, Gina?

58:12.008 --> 58:14.260
Because I know a lot of things.

58:16.317 --> 58:19.033
I know you promise that
you won't hurt them...

58:20.076 --> 58:21.537
but you will.

58:21.637 --> 58:23.606
What is that symbol?

58:38.387 --> 58:42.531
We don't have much time.
Please. Let me show you.

58:42.631 --> 58:44.988
Do you remember Carla?

58:46.598 --> 58:49.152
The one with pierced nipples.

58:51.663 --> 58:54.085
When that capsule exploded
in her stomach...

58:54.958 --> 58:57.547
the last thing she did before dying...

58:58.117 --> 59:00.047
was cry your name.

59:06.394 --> 59:08.398
Now you're shy.

59:10.631 --> 59:12.803
Show me how you do it.

59:15.215 --> 59:17.688
What do you want to put inside Jill?

59:21.897 --> 59:25.993
Dad, I can't find them anywhere.
What is he doing here?

59:27.805 --> 59:30.484
- The hand.
- It's okay.

59:34.611 --> 59:36.480
It's the other woman.

59:38.419 --> 59:40.514
You know you want to.

01:00:20.808 --> 01:00:23.102
Make it stop. Please make it stop.

01:00:23.202 --> 01:00:25.614
That's what Carla used to say.

01:00:27.765 --> 01:00:30.522
Your pain is just starting.

01:00:36.439 --> 01:00:41.296
David, you have to trust me if
you want your family to survive.

01:00:57.161 --> 01:00:58.345
Gina.

01:01:00.363 --> 01:01:01.513
Gina.

01:01:14.772 --> 01:01:18.516
Stay away from me, Gina! Stay away!

01:01:19.914 --> 01:01:22.318
Gina isn't here anymore.

01:01:30.592 --> 01:01:33.230
Her name was Elena.
She was a <i>bruja</i>.

01:01:33.330 --> 01:01:35.545
- A what?
- A witch.

01:01:35.899 --> 01:01:40.003
The Spanish priests, they hung her
here in Gallows Hill in the 17th century.

01:01:40.103 --> 01:01:45.317
30 years ago, Felipe found an old man
sealed away with those ancient symbols.

01:01:45.417 --> 01:01:47.277
- He let him out.
- You said Elena was the witch.

01:01:47.377 --> 01:01:51.147
She cannot be killed. If you kill her,
she will go inside of you.

01:01:51.247 --> 01:01:55.383
When she went into his daughter,
Felipe built that box to hold her.

01:01:58.287 --> 01:02:01.191
Felipe wrote down everything
he found out in that diary.

01:02:01.291 --> 01:02:03.994
Whatever you do, do not listen to her.

01:02:04.094 --> 01:02:07.711
She knows all your secrets.
She will use them against you.

01:02:23.713 --> 01:02:27.050
We are too late.
The boy must have shot her.

01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:30.452
- She's inside him now.
- You saying Ramon killed Gina?

01:02:30.753 --> 01:02:33.773
Keep him away from your family.
She'll do anything to leave.

01:02:51.506 --> 01:02:52.442
Oh, my God.

01:02:52.542 --> 01:02:55.011
These all happened right before
the inn closed down in '78.

01:02:55.111 --> 01:02:56.491
What does... what does this mean?

01:02:57.013 --> 01:03:01.284
Auto-da-fé. It says here it's
the burning of the heretic.

01:03:01.384 --> 01:03:03.887
The Spanish inquisition killed
thousands of innocents that way.

01:03:03.987 --> 01:03:06.223
Apparently this one
wasn't so innocent.

01:03:08.558 --> 01:03:09.823
Morales?

01:03:16.253 --> 01:03:19.258
I'll never die, Morales.

01:03:20.796 --> 01:03:23.755
Not even your children
we'll be safe from me.

01:03:42.792 --> 01:03:44.688
A witch? Really, David?

01:03:44.888 --> 01:03:48.130
- Look at all this research Felipe has done.
- What are all those names?

01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:51.067
These are the same names that
are on the newspapers. Look.

01:03:51.167 --> 01:03:54.204
Hernandez, Perez...

01:03:54.504 --> 01:03:56.773
- Morales.
- Morales?

01:03:56.873 --> 01:03:58.747
Like Captain Morales.

01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:04.047
These are the descendants of those who
were responsible for the hanging of Elena.

01:04:04.147 --> 01:04:05.815
The witch.

01:04:06.550 --> 01:04:10.521
Open the door! Ramon is coming!
He's wounded!

01:04:10.621 --> 01:04:14.783
Who are you? Why is your
name in Felipe's journal?!

01:04:15.558 --> 01:04:20.029
My ancestor! He was priest
in the hanging of the <i>bruja</i>!

01:04:20.129 --> 01:04:22.209
Please open the door!

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.931
She killed my father, David!

01:04:28.371 --> 01:04:30.542
Come on! Please!

01:04:32.908 --> 01:04:34.678
Jill, go to the kitchen and
get me some wet rags.

01:04:34.778 --> 01:04:36.078
Yeah.

01:04:36.679 --> 01:04:39.549
- Where's Ramon?
- I shot him in the leg to slow him down.

01:04:39.649 --> 01:04:41.417
How do we make this stop?

01:04:42.017 --> 01:04:44.888
She will not stop until
she kills every descendant.

01:04:45.188 --> 01:04:49.570
She does not care about you.
You're just in the way.

01:04:50.059 --> 01:04:51.724
You still have my car keys?

01:04:52.662 --> 01:04:55.142
You take your family away from here.

01:04:55.542 --> 01:04:58.315
She does not want you.
Only me. I am sorry.

01:04:58.415 --> 01:05:00.041
This is all my fault.
I let her out of the box.

01:05:00.141 --> 01:05:05.842
No, no. I am responsible for the witch.
You save your family.

01:05:23.161 --> 01:05:24.527
Jill!

01:05:24.627 --> 01:05:27.369
- Jill, it's me! Open up!
- Gina?

01:05:27.931 --> 01:05:32.669
Oh, my God. Gina, you're alive?
Where have you been? What happened?

01:05:32.769 --> 01:05:36.472
Open the door. I was hiding.
Ramon tried to kill me!

01:05:36.973 --> 01:05:38.840
Open up!

01:05:45.381 --> 01:05:46.715
Gina?

01:05:57.953 --> 01:05:59.956
Open the fucking door, Jill!

01:06:01.721 --> 01:06:05.238
Open the door, you little bitch.
Give me Morales.

01:06:05.338 --> 01:06:07.416
Or I'll rip your fucking head off!

01:06:07.716 --> 01:06:09.240
No!

01:06:12.041 --> 01:06:14.527
- What are you doing? I had him.
- Saving your life.

01:06:14.627 --> 01:06:16.547
You can't kill him. Come on!

01:06:21.184 --> 01:06:26.067
Remember, you see Ramon,
it's not Ramon. It's the <i>bruja</i>.

01:06:27.023 --> 01:06:32.095
You do not kill her. You wound her.
You slow her down.

01:06:32.195 --> 01:06:36.902
You mustn't kill her, for your sake.
If you kill him, you die.

01:06:40.203 --> 01:06:41.536
Come on.

01:07:00.706 --> 01:07:01.871
Gina's dead.

01:07:20.714 --> 01:07:21.744
Fuck!

01:07:30.953 --> 01:07:33.357
- Bitch!
- Fuck you!

01:07:34.858 --> 01:07:36.392
Jill, come on.

01:07:37.093 --> 01:07:41.498
David, no! David!
It's me, Ramon! David, it's me!

01:07:41.598 --> 01:07:43.533
You go get Morales.
I'll keep Ramon here.

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:46.936
He's not going anywhere.
I just handcuffed him to the truck.

01:07:47.036 --> 01:07:48.706
You got him. Oh, my...

01:07:54.111 --> 01:07:56.980
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:59.515
- No!
- What are you doing?

01:08:00.916 --> 01:08:02.973
Come on, David!

01:08:03.753 --> 01:08:05.255
Come on!

01:08:06.923 --> 01:08:08.825
David, see you soon.

01:08:09.926 --> 01:08:12.929
We'll talk about what
you did to Marcela.

01:08:22.203 --> 01:08:23.540
- Give me the keys.
- What are you doing?

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:26.875
Give me the handcuff keys.
Give me the keys! Please!

01:08:27.774 --> 01:08:29.377
- David!
- Wait.

01:08:54.368 --> 01:08:56.740
David, what are you doing?
He'll try to kill us again.

01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:00.143
- Come on. Come on. Breathe!
- Why are you trying to save him?

01:09:00.243 --> 01:09:03.680
The witch! If we kill her,
she somehow takes over your body!

01:09:03.779 --> 01:09:05.014
What?

01:09:13.156 --> 01:09:14.658
- Dad!
- Lauren!

01:09:16.259 --> 01:09:20.095
Stay with me, baby! Stay with me!
Look! You have to fight it! Come on!

01:09:20.895 --> 01:09:25.868
You're still in there. You can fight it.
Stay with me. Look at me! Lauren!

01:09:26.169 --> 01:09:27.970
Come on! Don't leave me!

01:09:29.738 --> 01:09:32.608
The rope! His rope!
Go get some rope! Quick!

01:09:37.814 --> 01:09:39.251
Hurry!

01:09:42.452 --> 01:09:43.920
Please. Please.

01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:45.721
- Here.
- Get her feet.

01:09:47.256 --> 01:09:51.995
It's all your fault, David. God is punishing
you and your family for what you did.

01:09:52.095 --> 01:09:54.330
- Oh, my God.
- You killed her, David.

01:09:54.430 --> 01:09:57.233
- Dad.
- Shut up!

01:09:57.333 --> 01:10:01.104
Oh, he turned off mommy's machine
because she wouldn't die fast enough.

01:10:01.804 --> 01:10:04.340
- Dad, what is she talking about?
- Shut up!

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:06.843
- Dad, did you do that?
- Help me, Jill. Please.

01:10:07.643 --> 01:10:11.409
Is that true? I hate you!

01:10:11.609 --> 01:10:13.754
- Jill!
- What?!

01:10:13.854 --> 01:10:16.452
We need to get her back to the house.
It might be the only way to save her.

01:10:16.552 --> 01:10:19.355
Please. Please.

01:10:20.056 --> 01:10:21.458
Jill!

01:10:35.405 --> 01:10:37.107
I need your help.

01:10:37.407 --> 01:10:39.809
El Capitán. Did you miss me?

01:10:40.409 --> 01:10:43.680
Elena is inside of her now.
We must take her back down to the box.

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:45.116
- For how long?
- Forever.

01:10:45.216 --> 01:10:48.950
- No. No, there has to be another way.
- David, she's no longer Lauren anymore.

01:10:49.050 --> 01:10:51.354
- You can't save her.
- He's lying. I can get her back.

01:10:51.454 --> 01:10:53.023
You give me another body,
and I'll give you Lauren.

01:10:53.123 --> 01:10:55.158
Felipe would have sacrificed
himself for Ana Maria.

01:10:55.258 --> 01:10:58.727
Once the witch has your body,
you are dead. Think of your daughter.

01:11:01.497 --> 01:11:04.601
Please, David. We must stop her now.

01:11:06.402 --> 01:11:07.970
Come on.

01:11:10.006 --> 01:11:12.508
Poor Lauren. Ugly and abused,
locked away.

01:11:12.608 --> 01:11:15.277
You gonna give up on her
just like you did Marcela?

01:11:27.256 --> 01:11:28.624
D-d-don't shoot!

01:11:50.211 --> 01:11:54.283
- I should have shot her.
- No. You can't kill her.

01:11:54.884 --> 01:11:56.486
You don't understand.

01:11:56.586 --> 01:12:00.490
I shoot her, I die, she take my body.

01:12:01.090 --> 01:12:04.827
- With no body...
- Without... without a host, she'll die?

01:12:04.927 --> 01:12:07.963
Go. Bring her out. I kill her.

01:12:08.063 --> 01:12:12.235
You... you and your daughter,
you... you'll be safe.

01:12:12.535 --> 01:12:14.370
Go quick.

01:12:15.271 --> 01:12:18.609
Okay. Hold. Come on.

01:12:38.426 --> 01:12:42.597
You want me?! I'm right here!

01:14:07.715 --> 01:14:10.620
Give yourself to me
and I'll let Jill live.

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:15.736
If I kill you, I give you my body,
you promise to let Jill live?

01:14:16.759 --> 01:14:18.194
Yes.

01:14:20.095 --> 01:14:21.994
I know all your secrets, David.

01:14:36.845 --> 01:14:38.550
I'm not gonna kill you.

01:14:41.751 --> 01:14:43.386
We'll see about that.

01:14:44.487 --> 01:14:45.956
Jill, run!

01:14:57.533 --> 01:14:58.735
Come on. Come on.

01:14:59.035 --> 01:15:01.736
- David!
- To the basement. Let's go!

01:15:04.574 --> 01:15:05.908
Come on.

01:15:15.084 --> 01:15:20.108
She'll come down here. She has to.
Lauren's body is too weak.

01:15:21.416 --> 01:15:23.141
She'll need one of us.

01:15:23.241 --> 01:15:24.961
- It's not gonna be you.
- If we both grab her,

01:15:25.061 --> 01:15:27.396
- then we can put her back.
- No, it's too dangerous.

01:15:27.496 --> 01:15:29.765
You stay away from her.
I'll get her back in the box.

01:15:30.065 --> 01:15:33.904
It's the only way to
destroy her. It'll be okay.

01:15:35.767 --> 01:15:40.094
Jill, it's just a game, honey.

01:15:40.594 --> 01:15:43.853
I'm not dead. Come upstairs.

01:15:45.947 --> 01:15:48.051
My little puss-puss.

01:15:49.952 --> 01:15:51.988
<i>Gatita.</i>

01:15:52.989 --> 01:15:54.623
What?

01:15:55.824 --> 01:15:58.196
Your mother used to call you
that when you were little.

01:16:01.397 --> 01:16:03.466
You never told me that.

01:16:05.334 --> 01:16:10.807
One day, you stood up on
this chair and you said...

01:16:12.133 --> 01:16:15.344
"I am not a little kitty,
and my name is Jill."

01:16:15.644 --> 01:16:17.379
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:20.783
David.

01:16:21.884 --> 01:16:24.954
You can't hide from me.

01:16:26.455 --> 01:16:29.812
She was... so...

01:16:30.826 --> 01:16:32.376
passionate.

01:16:33.085 --> 01:16:34.763
So strong. Remember?

01:16:36.064 --> 01:16:39.034
I realized too late that's
why I fell in love with her.

01:16:39.134 --> 01:16:43.858
She wasn't gonna get any better.
She knew it, too.

01:16:44.674 --> 01:16:48.979
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:16:57.748 --> 01:17:00.022
You're a lot like her, you know?

01:17:01.257 --> 01:17:02.926
Yeah?

01:17:05.127 --> 01:17:07.028
David!

01:17:08.998 --> 01:17:10.999
Listen, you have to hide, okay?

01:17:11.099 --> 01:17:13.770
Promise me you won't come out
until after she's gone, okay?

01:17:13.870 --> 01:17:16.539
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you, <i>gatita</i>.

01:17:16.639 --> 01:17:18.941
From the moment you were born.

01:17:19.742 --> 01:17:20.731
Okay.

01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:34.455
David.

01:17:49.036 --> 01:17:51.607
I'm finished with this body, David.

01:17:51.707 --> 01:17:54.676
And now I want yours.

01:18:01.617 --> 01:18:03.120
Marcela?

01:18:05.121 --> 01:18:06.722
No. No.

01:18:08.023 --> 01:18:10.126
Shall I continue?

01:18:10.226 --> 01:18:12.528
Don't. It's not you.

01:18:12.628 --> 01:18:14.845
- More?
- It's not you. No.

01:18:16.298 --> 01:18:17.800
It's not you!

01:18:28.042 --> 01:18:30.278
Give yourself to me!

01:18:34.616 --> 01:18:38.186
You are too weak to
put me back in the box!

01:18:54.803 --> 01:18:56.573
I can't.

01:18:59.074 --> 01:19:01.609
It's Marcela, baby.

01:19:08.983 --> 01:19:10.306
Marcela.

01:19:11.587 --> 01:19:14.789
Marcela. Marcela.

01:19:23.932 --> 01:19:26.135
- Please.
- Marcela.

01:19:26.235 --> 01:19:28.081
- Let me go.
- Marcela.

01:19:30.039 --> 01:19:34.109
- Kill me again.
- I can't. I can't.

01:19:34.710 --> 01:19:35.886
I can't.

01:19:36.712 --> 01:19:37.980
I can't.

01:19:39.381 --> 01:19:41.649
You are useless to me.

01:19:49.257 --> 01:19:52.595
You have no idea what I'm
gonna do with your body.

01:19:53.295 --> 01:19:55.333
You don't know all my secrets.

01:19:55.433 --> 01:19:56.231
No!

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:05.986
No!

01:20:08.243 --> 01:20:10.480
Dad, Dad, shut the door.

01:20:12.581 --> 01:20:15.985
- Shut the door.
- What did you do?

01:20:16.285 --> 01:20:20.056
Come on. Please. Please!

01:20:20.556 --> 01:20:22.457
Just do it!

01:20:22.758 --> 01:20:25.161
I love you, Daddy.

01:20:26.862 --> 01:20:28.631
No, wait! What are you doing?!

01:20:28.731 --> 01:20:31.199
- No, no! Dad!
- Listen to me.

01:20:31.299 --> 01:20:33.202
- I won't leave you.
- You have to go!

01:20:33.302 --> 01:20:36.172
No, you have to go! You have to go!

01:20:36.672 --> 01:20:40.008
- I love you. I love you.
- I'm so scared, Dad.

01:20:40.108 --> 01:20:42.945
No, dear God. Take me.
No, no. Jill. Jill. Jill.

01:20:46.949 --> 01:20:48.486
No!

01:20:52.187 --> 01:20:53.681
Take me.

01:20:54.090 --> 01:20:55.597
Take me.

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:01.163
It was supposed to be me!

01:21:47.774 --> 01:21:51.702
Don't leave me here to die. Like mom.

01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:14.495
<i>It all started with a secret.</i>

01:22:17.873 --> 01:22:19.364
<i>We all have them.</i>

01:22:21.043 --> 01:22:23.477
<i>Everyone's is different.</i>

01:22:31.552 --> 01:22:34.401
<i>Most secrets don't carry much weight.</i>

01:22:36.358 --> 01:22:38.160
<i>But some...</i>

01:22:39.561 --> 01:22:42.593
<i>some secrets can destroy
everything you love.</i>

01:22:48.002 --> 01:22:50.337
<i>I'll bring Jill home.</i>

01:22:53.074 --> 01:22:55.475
<i>I will not quit.</i>

01:22:58.379 --> 01:23:00.020
<i>I will find a way.</i>

01:23:06.387 --> 01:23:08.290
<i>I will get my daughter back.</i>

01:23:11.660 --> 01:23:13.429
Daddy.
