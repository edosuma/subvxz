- Okay.

13:22.333 --> 13:25.166
-
- Tootsie, daddy's home.

13:25.250 --> 13:29.000
Hey, Phil, I wasn't expecting you
till tomorrow.

13:29.083 --> 13:31.542
Oh, I came back early.
I miss my tootsie. Where is she?

13:31.625 --> 13:34.041
She's... she's not here.

13:34.417 --> 13:36.166
What are you talking? She's right there.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.125
Phil, we need to talk.

13:40.792 --> 13:42.959
I never thought
I would hear myself say these words,

13:44.000 --> 13:46.834
but I have developed
some very strong feelings for your goat.

13:49.333 --> 13:50.375
Okay.

13:50.458 --> 13:51.709
She saved my life.

13:52.208 --> 13:54.709
I can't just give her back. I won't.

13:56.583 --> 13:58.625
And you've discussed this?

14:00.333 --> 14:01.417
Is this what she wants?

14:01.875 --> 14:05.417
She doesn't know what she wants.
She's just a crazy mixed-up kid.

14:06.792 --> 14:07.792
Okay, okay.

14:08.542 --> 14:10.500
Well, then there's only one thing left
for us to do.

14:11.125 --> 14:13.709
We leave her alone
and let her heart decide.

14:17.542 --> 14:19.083
Come here, Tootsie baby.

14:19.166 --> 14:20.250
Tootsie baby, come here.

14:20.333 --> 14:22.000
- Who's your daddy?
- Who's your daddy, Tootsie?

14:22.083 --> 14:25.792
- You know you wanna come over here.
- I take such good care of you.

14:25.875 --> 14:29.333
- You know I love you.
-

14:34.125 --> 14:35.583
- Okay.
-

14:36.542 --> 14:38.583
Okay. I...

14:39.375 --> 14:40.875
I guess you've made up your mind.

14:42.750 --> 14:44.542
I Hope you two have a nice life together.

14:49.333 --> 14:50.959
I think he took that really well.

14:51.125 --> 14:55.709
Oh, my God!

14:57.000 --> 14:58.333
Or maybe not.

14:58.417 --> 14:59.792
My heart has come out!

15:01.458 --> 15:04.000
After my commander got shot in the leg,

15:04.083 --> 15:08.583
I put him on my back and let him ride me
into battle like a horse.

15:13.250 --> 15:16.166
What's up, Martinez?
You look a little different.

15:16.250 --> 15:19.583
Hit puberty, yo.
Sprouted some new pit hair.

15:19.667 --> 15:20.667
Check it.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.959
- Wait a minute.
- Ow!

15:23.709 --> 15:26.667
This isn't real pit hair,
and you're not Jerry.

15:27.333 --> 15:28.667
You're that nerd Milton.

15:29.083 --> 15:31.250
Hey, guys, fresh nerd meat.

15:33.125 --> 15:37.333
What? You don't need your boys.
We can work this out ourselves.

15:37.417 --> 15:39.792
Oh!

15:42.041 --> 15:43.917
Okay, fine, I'm a nerd.

15:44.917 --> 15:50.166
The nerd who masterminded the only escape
from maximum security lockdown detention.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
Whoa! You're right. How'd you do it?

15:56.083 --> 15:58.709
Laundry cart? Bribe somebody?
Dig a tunnel?

15:58.834 --> 16:01.625
No, man, we went up.

16:03.375 --> 16:05.458
Spaceship.

16:14.834 --> 16:16.667
-
- What's with the get-up?

16:17.125 --> 16:21.709
This is traditional <i>hahmah</i> mourning garb.

16:22.667 --> 16:26.291
We wear it when we are grieving
the loss of a goat that we loved.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.375
Okay.

16:31.333 --> 16:33.875
Can I get a number four
with some <i>baba ganoush</i> poppers?

16:36.959 --> 16:39.750
Number four with <i>baba ganoush</i> popper.

16:41.208 --> 16:42.375
And some pickled carrots.

16:44.959 --> 16:46.625
And some pickled carrot.

16:50.208 --> 16:56.917
For 15 cents extra,
you can supersize your drink.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.667
Why, Tootsie?

17:00.875 --> 17:03.458
Phil, I think
you should have Tootsie back.

17:04.041 --> 17:04.875
Huh?

17:05.166 --> 17:07.834
It's the right thing to do.
She belongs with you.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.583
- Oh!
- No, no, uh...

17:11.500 --> 17:12.792
Oh!

17:12.875 --> 17:14.417
Could I just have a moment to say goodbye?

17:14.667 --> 17:16.291
Yes, of course.

17:19.208 --> 17:21.166
You're fired, Phyllis. Tootsie's back.

17:25.542 --> 17:27.375
<i>-
- We didn't stand a chance, Tootsie.</i>

17:27.917 --> 17:31.542
-
- No, you let me get this out.

17:33.792 --> 17:35.959
Of all the karate joints in all the world,

17:36.625 --> 17:38.083
you pooped in front of mine,

17:39.792 --> 17:42.250
but you also pooped on my heart.

17:44.250 --> 17:45.625
I have a picture of us.

17:48.125 --> 17:49.208
I want you to have it.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.500
- Let it be a reminder of--
-

17:52.583 --> 17:54.542
Or you could just eat it.
Sure, that works.

17:57.834 --> 17:59.583
Tony, you don't have to cut gym.

17:59.667 --> 18:02.500
Just show up with two left shoes
and tell coach you have to sit out

18:02.583 --> 18:04.250
'cause you're waiting
on a foot transplant.

18:06.083 --> 18:06.959
Next.

18:07.375 --> 18:12.166
Hey, all you kids sitting back here
listening to his every word,

18:12.333 --> 18:15.709
I wouldn't put much stock in it.
He's sitting here in detention.

18:15.792 --> 18:17.458
How smart can that be?

18:17.542 --> 18:19.166
Smart enough to outsmart you.

18:19.250 --> 18:21.166
In 32 years of business,

18:21.250 --> 18:23.917
no one has ever outsmarted me.

18:24.458 --> 18:26.000
Think about that, punk.

18:26.709 --> 18:29.166
Okay, two thoughts occur...

18:30.375 --> 18:34.166
One, You have what looks like a wad
of pepperoni in your mustache.

18:35.041 --> 18:38.000
And two, this punk just outsmarted you.

18:38.875 --> 18:42.750
I'm not Jerry Martinez.
I'm Milton Krupnick.

18:43.291 --> 18:45.125
That's right. I busted him out.

18:45.208 --> 18:49.125
What? No kid has ever escaped
from my detention.

18:49.208 --> 18:51.250
My perfect record was all I had.

18:51.750 --> 18:54.917
That and the love
of sweet labradoodle Irene.

18:56.250 --> 18:57.458
Oh, yeah, and the wife.

18:59.709 --> 19:03.000
Listen, Harvey, maybe nobody
has to know about this.

19:03.083 --> 19:04.166
What do you mean?

19:04.625 --> 19:07.250
Everyone will keep their yaps shut,
right, fellas?

19:07.333 --> 19:08.166
Yeah.

19:08.917 --> 19:12.792
If... you make some changes around here.

19:13.333 --> 19:16.542
Changes? What kind of changes?

19:23.333 --> 19:24.458
You know, uh, Milton,

19:25.125 --> 19:27.625
I should fix you up with this girl,
Holotta.

19:28.917 --> 19:32.417
She's trouble, but I think you'd like her.

19:32.959 --> 19:35.083
Randy, don't even think about it.

19:41.041 --> 19:44.250
Come on, Eddie! Come on, Eddie!

19:49.041 --> 19:51.583
- Winner!
- Who's a mama's boy now?

19:53.166 --> 19:55.250
Look, mommy, I won!

19:58.500 --> 20:01.291
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

20:01.375 --> 20:04.208
Where did Jerry go?
His whole family's here and he's up next.

20:04.583 --> 20:07.417
- I'll go talk to him.
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

20:08.834 --> 20:11.667
Jerry, what are you doing?
Your whole family's waiting.

20:11.959 --> 20:14.375
Rudy, I was so excited
about my family coming to watch me.

20:14.375 --> 20:17.333
That... I didn't think how they
would feel about me if I lost.

20:17.709 --> 20:20.709
They don't care if you win.
They're here because they love you.

20:21.250 --> 20:22.375
Thanks, Rudy.

20:23.250 --> 20:26.333
Hey, I got something for you.
Maybe it'll inspire you.

20:28.875 --> 20:30.792
It's a picture of us
at your first tournament.

20:31.166 --> 20:33.458
I want you to have it.
Let it be a reminder--

20:33.542 --> 20:35.458
Or you could just eat it.
Sure, that works.

20:36.250 --> 20:38.417
Sorry, Rudy, I'm a nervous eater.
I'll see ya.

20:39.750 --> 20:42.208
Jerry!

20:42.291 --> 20:45.959
Bow! Ready? Fight!

20:46.041 --> 20:48.750
Ay, papi!

20:51.166 --> 20:53.208
