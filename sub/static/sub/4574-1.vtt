01:55.615 --> 01:57.367
Ok, go on through.

02:17.095 --> 02:19.180
All metal objects into the tray.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.600
Purpose of visit?

02:23.518 --> 02:26.354
A patient pick up and transfer to Smith's Grove.

02:26.896 --> 02:28.481
You're late.
- Yeah. 

02:28.690 --> 02:30.525
Should be on the road.
- Yeah.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.610
Hell of a night, huh?
- Real charmer.

02:32.736 --> 02:35.238
Yeah. I'll take you down there.
- All right.

02:35.363 --> 02:36.990
Let them in.
- Ok.

02:42.620 --> 02:45.040
First time here, huh?
- Hope it's the last time.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.709
You never get used to the faces. Never.

02:52.380 --> 02:53.840
Jesus!

02:55.342 --> 02:58.011
Jesus ain't got nothing to do with this place.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.013
Come on.

03:09.606 --> 03:13.193
Yeah, this is where the society
dumps its worst nightmares.

03:16.946 --> 03:18.156
Yeah the one you're picking up ...

03:18.907 --> 03:21.618
Just thinking about him
gives me the willies.

03:21.951 --> 03:24.162
A decade ago, Halloween night ...

03:24.287 --> 03:27.248
He murdered 16 people ...
maybe more.

03:27.374 --> 03:28.708
Trying to get to his sister.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.002
Nearly got her too. 

03:31.211 --> 03:33.421
But his doctor ... of all people,

03:33.546 --> 03:35.674
shot him ... six times.

03:35.965 --> 03:37.592
Then he set him on fire. 

03:37.717 --> 03:39.803
Both of them nearly burned to death.

03:40.303 --> 03:44.015
Yeah, I'll be glad to see this one gone.
Yes, indeedy!

03:48.520 --> 03:50.063
Welcome to Hell.

03:53.858 --> 03:55.151
Doctor?
- Yes?

03:55.276 --> 03:57.320
The transfer personnel are here.

04:01.449 --> 04:03.326
Smith's Grove?
- Yes.

04:03.451 --> 04:06.204
I'm Dr. Hoffman, medical administrator.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.581
Has he been prepped?
- Ready to go.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.250
Who signs for him?

04:10.542 --> 04:11.418
I do.

04:11.876 --> 04:13.044
Outside.

04:13.211 --> 04:14.462
Check him out.

04:49.247 --> 04:51.499
I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.

04:51.624 --> 04:54.169
Michael Myers is still his patient.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.671
Well, if Loomis read memos, he'd be here.

04:56.796 --> 05:00.383
Fortunately his position is more ceremonial than medical.

05:00.508 --> 05:02.135
And with Myers gone ...

05:02.510 --> 05:05.388
My hope is that he'll either transfer ...

05:05.513 --> 05:07.140
retire...

05:09.309 --> 05:10.769
or die.

05:14.773 --> 05:17.150
All right, let's move him.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.454
Watch it.

05:29.704 --> 05:30.664
I got this end.

05:31.039 --> 05:36.503
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
- Yeah. I guess you're happy to see him go.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.882
Locked and loaded.
- Let's roll.

05:42.217 --> 05:43.009
Night, doc.

05:43.134 --> 05:44.678
Drive carefully.

06:14.874 --> 06:18.086
Did Hoffman say anything about living relatives?
- Yeah.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.338
A niece living in his hometown.

06:22.465 --> 06:23.341
And?

06:23.925 --> 06:26.636
"And?" She's too young to be his legal ward.

06:27.095 --> 06:29.931
So the state owns him?
Great.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.393
You know, I still don't understand.

06:40.859 --> 06:43.945
No!

07:02.964 --> 07:04.049
Kido ...

07:05.008 --> 07:07.010
It's 4:00 in the morning.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.887
I can't sleep.

07:09.179 --> 07:11.181
What is this?
Four nights in a row?

07:11.723 --> 07:15.685
You going for a record here?
The seven-year-old insomniac's hall of fame?

07:15.935 --> 07:17.729
Do you love me, Rachel?

07:18.688 --> 07:22.609
Serious questions tonight.
Of course I love you.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.194
Like a sister?

07:24.527 --> 07:27.655
Jamie, sometimes it's ...
- Like a real sister?

07:28.823 --> 07:31.451
We're not really sisters, Jamie.

07:32.035 --> 07:34.954
But that doesn't mean that I love you any less.

07:37.832 --> 07:39.459
Sure it does.

07:41.252 --> 07:46.424
I know you miss your parents. It hasn't been that long.
- It's been 11 months.

07:48.051 --> 07:51.805
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.
I'll bet you didn't know that.

07:51.930 --> 07:55.350
You're lucky.
I wish she could do the same for me.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.854
Come on, Jamie.
Let's go back to bed.

08:00.397 --> 08:01.314
Come on, Sunday.

08:10.824 --> 08:14.202
Sleep tight.
We'll have French toast for breakfast, ok?

08:14.619 --> 08:15.453
Nighty-night.

08:15.578 --> 08:16.746
Come on, Sunday.

08:17.539 --> 08:18.623
Nighty-night.

09:31.946 --> 09:36.076
Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

09:36.201 --> 09:40.413
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul will take.

09:40.664 --> 09:43.041
God bless 
Mr. and Mrs. Corruthers.

09:43.166 --> 09:46.961
God bless Rachel, God bless Sunday, God bless me.

09:47.087 --> 09:50.840
And God bless mommy and daddy in heaven. Amen.

10:57.782 --> 11:01.202
Help me please!
Somebody help me!

11:01.328 --> 11:03.455
Help me!

11:07.250 --> 11:09.377
Jamie!

11:15.508 --> 11:20.430
Oh, dear God!
It's all right, sweetheart.

11:21.097 --> 11:25.435
A bad dream. That's all.
Just a nasty old dream.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.688
I've got you.
You're safe now, see?

11:28.897 --> 11:31.191
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

11:31.316 --> 11:34.235
It's okay. Shh.

11:34.736 --> 11:38.323
You're gonna be just fine.
It's okay, baby. You're gonna be fine.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.265
Damn it!
Darlene!

12:06.393 --> 12:10.063
There's a clean one in the laundry
room next to your blue slacks. Hello?

12:10.605 --> 12:14.025
Honey, this tie's got a spot on it.
I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck.

12:14.150 --> 12:17.487
Hang on, Mrs. Pierce.
Not that tie. On the other side.

12:17.612 --> 12:19.531
That's not the only thing
you're eating, Rachel!

12:19.656 --> 12:23.410
Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?
- Found it.

12:23.535 --> 12:24.411
Sorry. 

12:24.536 --> 12:27.372
Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches?

12:28.456 --> 12:31.835
Stupid question.
Tell her I hope she feels better.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.797
Susan's mother.
She can't baby-sit tonight.

12:35.922 --> 12:36.673
Why not? 

12:36.798 --> 12:39.342
Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.972
Rachel?
- Mom, please.

12:44.848 --> 12:46.766
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.

12:46.891 --> 12:49.978
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady.
You know how important that is.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.605
Well. Tonight is very important for your father and me.

12:52.731 --> 12:55.567
Can't you find somebody else?
- It's too late.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.318
What am I supposed to tell Brady?

12:57.444 --> 13:01.114
"Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister.
Go and have fun by yourself."

13:01.239 --> 13:03.908
It's not exactly the end of the world for goodness' sake.
- Oh, sure it is.

13:04.826 --> 13:07.454
I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment.

13:07.579 --> 13:09.914
But now, my future relationship
my engagement ...

13:10.498 --> 13:15.337
my marriage, my children and your grandchildren
have all been wiped out, because I have to baby-sit.

13:16.421 --> 13:20.258
I'm sorry I ruined everything.
If I wasn't here, you could go out.

13:23.011 --> 13:24.262
Good job, Rachel.

13:24.387 --> 13:27.390
That little girl needs all the love
we can give her right now.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.976
And all you can do is think about yourself?

13:38.026 --> 13:38.860
Jamie?

13:44.407 --> 13:47.494
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it like that.

13:47.744 --> 13:50.830
I can go out with Brady tomorrow night.
It's no big deal.

13:50.955 --> 13:54.209
But you wanted to go out tonight.
It's my fault you can't.

13:54.334 --> 13:57.921
Well, tonight we're going to do something better.
We're going to go trick-or-treating.

13:58.046 --> 13:59.464
I don't want to. 

13:59.798 --> 14:04.511
It's Halloween! I mean: don't you want to get dressed up
in a really scary costume and get some candy?

14:08.848 --> 14:12.560
How 'bout this afternoon I pick you up
from school and we go get ice cream?

14:13.186 --> 14:14.688
Double scoops?

14:15.397 --> 14:18.191
Double scoops.
Now let's get some breakfast.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.988
Dr. Quinn, call 7402.

14:38.586 --> 14:39.879
Why wasn't I notified?

14:40.005 --> 14:43.174
About what?
- You know damn well about what.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.885
You let them take it out of here.

14:46.011 --> 14:50.223
For Christ's sake, spare me the speech.
I've listened to it for a decade.

14:50.390 --> 14:56.229
The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient and
a federal prisoner. Therefore he's subject to federal law.

14:56.354 --> 15:03.695
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner, Hoffman.
We are talking about an evil on two legs.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.322
I can see this is useless.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.950
Do you know what today is?

15:09.993 --> 15:11.411
Do you know the date?

15:12.996 --> 15:15.415
Every day I look at myself in the mirror and ...

15:15.540 --> 15:17.459
And every day I remember.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.754
Look at me ... Hoffman!

15:21.046 --> 15:22.630
Take a good look!

15:25.800 --> 15:29.179
I don't want anyone to have to live
through that night again.

15:30.847 --> 15:35.018
I've said this before.
I think you're the one who needs mental help.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.693
Yes? Dr. Hoffman.

15:47.364 --> 15:48.698
I see.

15:49.824 --> 15:51.409
I see. Thank you.

15:53.787 --> 15:58.625
Apparently there was an accident
just south of Mill Creek near the bri ... Loomis?

15:59.125 --> 16:00.293
Loomis!

16:23.983 --> 16:24.859
Is that it?

16:24.984 --> 16:26.820
Yes.
- When did this happen?

16:26.945 --> 16:31.074
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road
in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens. 

16:31.199 --> 16:33.576
An accident?
- Yes, sir.
- Do you believe that?

16:33.702 --> 16:34.869
Why shouldn't I?

16:34.995 --> 16:36.830
How many people in the bus? 

16:37.038 --> 16:38.873
Four ... plus Myers.

16:42.627 --> 16:46.589
How many bodies did you find?
- It's hard to tell, they're all chewed up.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.428
Loomis?

16:52.178 --> 16:53.805
It's over. Leave it alone.

17:20.498 --> 17:21.708
He's gone.

17:22.541 --> 17:23.626
He was here ...

17:23.752 --> 17:25.045
... but he's gone.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.838
Did you find any other bodies? 

17:26.963 --> 17:30.091
Not yet. There's a lot of ground to cover.
- You won't find him.

17:30.884 --> 17:32.594
He's done all this.

17:33.011 --> 17:35.805
Now he's escaped.
- You don't know that.

17:35.930 --> 17:38.183
Michael could've been thrown from the bus.

17:38.308 --> 17:41.102
I've seen bodies thrown 50 - 60 feet from a crash site.

17:41.227 --> 17:44.773
Even if by some miracle Michael's conscious ...

17:44.898 --> 17:50.362
his ... his muscles would be totally useless.
Give the troopers a chance to search.

17:50.487 --> 17:53.615
You're talking about him as if he were a human being.

17:54.366 --> 17:57.369
That part of him died years ago.

17:58.787 --> 18:00.789
Now where are you going?

18:01.164 --> 18:02.374
Haddonfield.

18:02.499 --> 18:04.417
It's a four hour drive.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.878
You can reach me through the local police.

18:07.003 --> 18:09.881
If you don't find him in four hours ... 

18:10.048 --> 18:11.925
I'm sure I will.

18:22.227 --> 18:25.689
Hey Gar. How 'bout a 9/16 socket over here?

19:00.849 --> 19:02.684
Hey! Hey there!

19:02.976 --> 19:03.852
Hello!

19:46.061 --> 19:47.145
Hello?

19:49.481 --> 19:50.357
Hello?

19:51.775 --> 19:53.026
Is anybody here?

19:57.030 --> 19:57.947
Hello?

20:02.494 --> 20:03.328
Hello!

20:26.267 --> 20:27.769
Is anybody here?

20:43.493 --> 20:44.995
God in heaven.

21:05.432 --> 21:06.599
Michael?

21:12.605 --> 21:13.898
Why now?

21:18.153 --> 21:19.821
You waited ten years.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.699
I knew this day would come.

21:23.742 --> 21:26.036
Don't go to Haddonfield.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.957
If you want another victim, take me.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.628
But leave those people in peace.

21:37.922 --> 21:39.049
Please ...

21:40.133 --> 21:41.343
Michael.

21:43.887 --> 21:45.430
Goddamn you.

22:08.161 --> 22:09.788
Michael!

22:49.327 --> 22:51.830
Hey Jamie!
Where's your costume?

22:52.080 --> 22:56.292
Where's your mask? Or are you wearing it?
- I don't need to wear a stupid costume!

22:56.418 --> 23:01.464
That's because every day is Halloween at Jamie's house.
Right, Jamie? - 'Cause your uncle's the boogeyman.

23:01.589 --> 23:05.885
Boogeyman! Boogeyman!
Jamie's uncle's the boogeyman!

23:06.011 --> 23:11.016
How come your mommy
didn't make you a costume, Jamie?
- How could she? Her mommy's dead.

23:11.141 --> 23:13.351
Jamie's mommy's ... a mummy!

23:13.476 --> 23:15.437
Stop it! Okay?
Stop it!

23:15.562 --> 23:22.027
Jamie's an orphan! Jamie's an orphan!
- Stop it! Please, stop it!

23:22.152 --> 23:26.406
Jamie's an orphan! Jamie's an orphan!

23:26.531 --> 23:30.785
Jamie's uncle's the boogeyman!
Jamie's an orphan!

23:30.910 --> 23:32.704
Every day is Halloween at Jamie's house.

23:32.829 --> 23:36.833
Boogeyman! Boogeyman! Boogeyman!

23:37.208 --> 23:40.837
... didn't make you ...?
- How could she? Her mommy's dead.

23:47.177 --> 23:49.596
You're okay, you're okay.

23:53.391 --> 23:54.351
Jamie!

23:56.978 --> 23:58.772
Jamie, are you okay?

24:07.614 --> 24:09.282
You remember Lindsey, don't you?

24:09.407 --> 24:11.076
Hi Jamie.
- Yeah, hi.

24:11.201 --> 24:12.994
You ready for some ice cream?

24:14.371 --> 24:17.874
I wanna go trick-or-treating ...
like the other kids.

24:18.041 --> 24:20.585
But I thought you didn't wanna go trick-or-treating.

24:22.170 --> 24:25.548
You know Rach, discount mart's
having a sale on Halloween costumes.

24:25.924 --> 24:28.802
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
- I know.

24:28.927 --> 24:29.886
Don't you wanna talk to him?

24:30.095 --> 24:32.597
I don't wanna look pushy.
- You won't look pushy.

24:32.722 --> 24:34.182
Well, I don't wanna come on too strong.

24:34.307 --> 24:37.977
A guy hates a girl that comes on too strong.
Fragile egos, and all of that.

24:38.103 --> 24:39.854
You won't come on too strong.

24:39.979 --> 24:42.524
Well, I don't wanna seem desperate or anything.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.901
Face it Rach, you are desperate.

24:46.820 --> 24:49.739
You're just gonna go in and buy a costume for Jamie.
Perfectly legit.

24:49.864 --> 24:51.282
I don't know.

24:51.741 --> 24:52.867
Well ...

24:53.034 --> 24:55.662
Do I drop you at the discount mart or the Dairy Queen?

24:56.329 --> 24:57.747
Jamie?

24:58.540 --> 25:01.793
Discount mart.
Can we get an ice cream after?

25:02.669 --> 25:04.004
You bet.

25:29.362 --> 25:31.031
Hey, Wade. Why don't you go ahead
and make your move? 

25:31.156 --> 25:32.615
Don't rush me, Brady.

25:32.741 --> 25:34.451
Timing's gotta be premo.

25:34.576 --> 25:37.620
Yeah well, money talks and bullshit walks.
You know what I mean?

25:37.787 --> 25:39.998
Double or nothing, you don't ask Kelly out.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.084
All right. Ten bucks.
Let's see it.

25:44.377 --> 25:45.837
He's not gonna do it.

25:46.087 --> 25:49.257
Chicken. - Don't forget, man.
She's Sheriff Meeker's daughter.

25:51.468 --> 25:53.011
Her daddy don't scare me.

26:01.478 --> 26:03.146
Fuck off, Wade.

26:08.151 --> 26:10.070
Hey, maybe you can come over right now.

26:10.195 --> 26:11.696
Oh, cool!

26:25.835 --> 26:27.629
Call me.
- Okay. Bye.

26:30.215 --> 26:31.257
Rachel? 

26:31.549 --> 26:33.593
What are you doing here?
I thought I was supposed to pick you up.

26:33.718 --> 26:35.970
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
- You do?

26:36.096 --> 26:39.265
Okay. Go down to aisle A.
We've got the best costumes in the whole town.

26:39.599 --> 26:41.476
Come on, Rachel.
- In a second.

26:42.477 --> 26:43.561
We need to talk.

26:43.687 --> 26:44.813
Okay, sure. What about? 

26:45.855 --> 26:47.357
About tonight.

27:27.188 --> 27:30.775
Rachel! I found the perfect costume.
Come see.

27:38.033 --> 27:38.867
What?

27:39.701 --> 27:42.787
My parents' baby-sitter's cancelled.
- So?

27:42.912 --> 27:45.332
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.

27:47.584 --> 27:48.835
When did you find this out?

27:48.960 --> 27:51.212
This morning.
- You found this morning?

27:51.338 --> 27:54.257
Why didn't you tell me before?
I mean it's 5 o'clock now, Rachel ... shit.

27:54.799 --> 27:58.219
Don't get angry.
- I'm not angry. It's just ...

28:01.890 --> 28:04.059
Can I come over after Jamie goes to sleep?

28:04.184 --> 28:06.519
My parents are gonna come home early tonight. 

28:06.644 --> 28:07.645
So?

28:09.022 --> 28:10.774
I don't know, Brady.

28:12.567 --> 28:13.610
Okay. 

28:14.069 --> 28:15.528
I guess, I'll call you later.

28:49.229 --> 28:51.189
Jamie, what happened?

28:52.649 --> 28:54.401
It was the nightmare man.

28:54.526 --> 28:55.276
What? 

28:55.402 --> 28:58.113
He's come to get me, Rachel.
- You're okay.

28:58.238 --> 29:00.532
You probably saw a mask and it scared you.

29:00.657 --> 29:02.492
At least you're not cut.

29:03.159 --> 29:04.911
Come on. Let's go home.

29:05.578 --> 29:06.329
You gonna be okay?

29:06.454 --> 29:07.706
She'll be fine

29:45.327 --> 29:46.995
Come on, old man.
Let's go!

29:47.120 --> 29:51.791
Come on! Come on!
Hurry up! Hurry up!

30:04.929 --> 30:07.015
Get it in here, old man.

30:08.850 --> 30:11.644
I ain't got till Judgment Day!

30:18.818 --> 30:19.736
Thank you. 

30:20.111 --> 30:22.155
Anything for a fellow pilgrim.

30:22.280 --> 30:26.534
We're all on a quest.
Sometimes we need help getting where we wanna be.

30:29.162 --> 30:32.082
Reverend Jackson Pete Sayer of Dumont county.

30:32.207 --> 30:34.000
Pleased to make your acquaintance. 

30:34.125 --> 30:35.960
How far you're going, Mr. Sayer?

30:36.086 --> 30:38.588
God's country, Promised Land. 

30:38.713 --> 30:41.049
Where you heading, Mr. ... ah

30:41.383 --> 30:42.634
Loomis.

30:43.134 --> 30:44.594
Haddonfield.

30:44.886 --> 30:46.179
Car trouble?

30:47.555 --> 30:48.682
Sort of.

30:51.685 --> 30:53.770
You're hunting it, ain't ya?

30:54.104 --> 30:56.272
Yeah, you're hunting it, all right.

30:56.398 --> 30:57.691
Just like me.

30:58.233 --> 31:00.276
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?

31:00.402 --> 31:04.072
Apocalypse, end of the world. Armageddon.

31:04.197 --> 31:06.616
It's always got a face and a name.

31:09.327 --> 31:12.831
I've been hunting the bastard for 30 years, give or take.

31:12.956 --> 31:14.874
Come close a time or two.

31:15.041 --> 31:17.210
Too damn close!

31:20.130 --> 31:22.841
You can't kill damnation, mister.

31:23.174 --> 31:26.177
It don't die like a man dies.

31:27.095 --> 31:29.180
I know that, Mr. Sayer.

31:30.473 --> 31:33.101
Oh, you're a pilgrim, all right!

31:33.226 --> 31:35.812
I saw it on your face
back there in the dust.

31:35.937 --> 31:40.525
I saw it clear as breasts and blue suede shoes.
Would you like a drink?

31:43.903 --> 31:48.074
* Yes, we'll gather at the river *

31:48.199 --> 31:53.163
* The beautiful, beautiful river *

31:53.288 --> 31:57.667
* Gather with the saints at the river *

32:18.146 --> 32:19.272
Okay Jamie, we're leaving.

32:19.397 --> 32:21.066
Where's Rach?
- I don't know.

32:21.191 --> 32:22.233
Here I am.

32:22.484 --> 32:23.360
Come on, hon.

32:24.361 --> 32:25.278
How do we look? 

32:25.779 --> 32:27.614
You guys always look great.

32:27.822 --> 32:28.907
We'll be at the Fallbrooks.

32:29.199 --> 32:34.788
The number's next to the phone. I know, and next to that
is Police, hospital, fire and probably the National Guard.

32:35.246 --> 32:37.916
I want you two to have fun tonight.
Make sure Jamie's in bed by 9:30.

32:38.041 --> 32:40.043
You're gonna be late.
You don't wanna blow your promotion.

32:40.168 --> 32:43.963
Don't make fun. Tonight is the difference
between vacations in Bermuda ...

32:44.089 --> 32:47.175
... or spending another two weeks
with your grandmother in Cleveland. So hurry up.

32:47.300 --> 32:47.884
Bye.

32:48.009 --> 32:49.844
See ya.
- Good luck, dad.

32:51.721 --> 32:55.100
Rachel?... Can I get my costume on?
- Yeah. Hurry up.

32:55.225 --> 32:56.101
Okay.

33:13.243 --> 33:14.744
Is Brady there?

33:15.412 --> 33:17.163
He's not back from work yet?

33:18.164 --> 33:19.040
Okay. 

33:19.290 --> 33:23.211
Well, when he comes in, could you tell him
to drop by about eight? I should be home by then.

33:23.670 --> 33:24.921
This is Rachel.

33:25.088 --> 33:26.047
Okay.

33:26.339 --> 33:27.215
Bye.

33:30.010 --> 33:32.846
Come on, Jamie.
You're gonna miss all the good candy.

33:37.267 --> 33:38.852
Come on, Jamie!

33:48.445 --> 33:49.696
Come on, Rachel!

33:50.155 --> 33:50.780
Coming.

33:50.905 --> 33:53.325
I thought you said you were ready.
- I'm ready! I'm ready!

33:53.450 --> 33:55.076
Okay, let's go.

34:37.661 --> 34:40.455
Ah, I need to speak with Sheriff Brackett.

34:42.331 --> 34:45.585
Then you'll have to travel
about 3,000 miles south of here.

34:45.752 --> 34:46.460
What?

34:46.585 --> 34:48.713
Brackett retired. Back in '81.

34:48.838 --> 34:50.674
He moved to St. Petersburg.

34:50.799 --> 34:53.885
Oh, Well, who's the new Sheriff?
- I am.

34:54.344 --> 34:55.594
Ben Meeker.

34:55.804 --> 34:59.557
Oh, Sheriff Meeker ...
my name is Dr. ...
- Loomis.

34:59.683 --> 35:02.435
Folks around here aren't
likely to forget your face.

35:02.894 --> 35:04.437
At least not cops.

35:04.562 --> 35:06.398
So, what brings you back here after ten years? 

35:06.523 --> 35:11.111
Michael Myers ... has escaped from Ridgemont.
He's here in Haddonfield.

35:11.528 --> 35:16.449
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
- He's here, Sheriff.

35:17.283 --> 35:18.243
Why?

35:18.493 --> 35:19.953
Ten years ago ...

35:20.370 --> 35:22.706
He tried to kill Laurie Strode.

35:23.331 --> 35:25.333
Now he wants her daughter.

35:27.669 --> 35:28.920
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
- Wherever she is, that little child is in mortal danger.

35:33.216 --> 35:38.304
Myers has been locked up since before she was born.
He's never laid eyes on her.

35:38.430 --> 35:42.976
Six bodies ... Sheriff! That's what I've seen
between here and Ridgemont.

35:43.101 --> 35:45.478
A filling station in flames!

35:45.603 --> 35:48.982
I tell you, Michael Myers is here in this town!

35:49.107 --> 35:53.028
He's here to kill that little girl
and anybody who gets in his way.

35:55.905 --> 35:58.950
All right, Pierce, call the troopers and check his story out.

35:59.492 --> 36:04.372
And assuming what you say is true.
- It's true, Sheriff! - All right, all right. It's true.

36:04.998 --> 36:07.500
What the hell can we do
to avoid a repeat of ten years ago?

36:07.625 --> 36:08.710
Find this little girl. 

36:08.835 --> 36:11.713
Get her someplace safe.
Call the local TV station.

36:11.838 --> 36:15.050
Tell them to get people off the streets
and behind locked doors.

36:15.175 --> 36:16.926
Can't get long distance, Sheriff.

36:17.093 --> 36:18.887
Operator says the lines are down.

36:22.682 --> 36:24.059
All right, let's go.

36:24.184 --> 36:25.852
When he makes that call ...

36:26.394 --> 36:27.937
All right, Pierce, do it.

36:28.063 --> 36:30.148
Let's check on this little girl.

36:32.192 --> 36:32.984
Thanks.

36:35.195 --> 36:38.406
Jamie, wait for me.
- This is great, Rachel. Come on!

36:49.709 --> 36:52.962
Trick-or-treat.
- Oh, my, what a scary little clown.

36:53.088 --> 36:55.215
Let's see what I have for you.
There you are, sweetheart.

36:55.340 --> 36:57.717
Thank you.
- You're welcome, honey.

36:59.260 --> 37:03.181
Had enough? - No way. Halloween's great.
Can we stay out all night?

37:03.306 --> 37:05.308
Forget it, kiddo.
We're home by eight o'clock.

37:15.235 --> 37:18.029
That clown costume is really cool!
- Really?

37:18.154 --> 37:18.988
Yeah. 

37:20.824 --> 37:22.492
Hey, you wanna go with us?

37:23.034 --> 37:24.202
Go ahead.

37:24.327 --> 37:24.995
Come on.

37:25.120 --> 37:26.705
Come on, come on. Let's go up there.

37:26.830 --> 37:28.915
Come on. Let's go!

37:34.838 --> 37:37.632
Trick-or-treat!

37:38.425 --> 37:39.175
Hi Rachel.

37:39.759 --> 37:40.593
Hi.

37:41.845 --> 37:43.847
Here you go, you little monster.

37:44.931 --> 37:47.517
Thank you.
- You little clown. - Thank you.

37:47.642 --> 37:50.020
There you go.
- Thank you. Trick-or-treat.

37:51.396 --> 37:52.105
Bye.

37:52.230 --> 37:53.398
Rachel!

37:57.610 --> 37:59.946
Rachel! - Brady!
- Just a second.

38:01.698 --> 38:04.909
Rachel ... I got an expla ... Rachel I ...

38:05.035 --> 38:08.955
I got an explanation.
- You don't owe me anything, Brady. No explanation.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.749
Will you just hold on a second?

38:11.207 --> 38:13.418
Just leave me alone and let's forget it.

38:13.543 --> 38:15.170
No, you don't understand.

38:16.588 --> 38:20.633
I mean you blew off our date at the last minute.
- So you hop onto the next best thing?

38:20.759 --> 38:24.179
I thought you were different from other guys.
- I'm different. It's just that ...

38:24.304 --> 38:29.017
I just got pissed off ... that's all.
- Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back
to little Ms. Hot Panties.

38:29.142 --> 38:30.894
Rachel!
- Jamie?

38:33.730 --> 38:34.689
Brady?

38:36.691 --> 38:38.526
Are you coming in or what?

38:49.162 --> 38:50.538
Jamie!

38:52.707 --> 38:54.292
Jamie!

38:56.294 --> 38:59.464
Great, Rachel ... just great.

39:01.466 --> 39:05.553
{y:i}By order of the Sheriff's Office, all citizens of Haddonfield
{y:i}are asked to clear the streets.

39:05.679 --> 39:08.181
I made that payment nine days ago
and still have nothing ...
- You were right.

39:09.057 --> 39:11.101
Everybody, shut up a Goddamn minute!

39:11.351 --> 39:12.435
Shut up!
{y:i}All businesses are asked to close as soon as possible.

39:14.688 --> 39:18.149
What's that shit about, Earl?
{y:i}Stay tuned to the station for updates.

39:18.274 --> 39:20.652
Not like ol' Ben Meeker do something like that.

39:21.027 --> 39:21.945
Sure ain't. 

39:22.070 --> 39:26.449
Martians could land on Ben's doorstep
and all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shotgun.

39:26.574 --> 39:29.077
Who are you calling?
- Police station.

39:29.202 --> 39:31.663
Ain't closing down without a good Goddamn reason.

39:34.249 --> 39:35.291
Well?

39:37.836 --> 39:39.087
Just rings.

39:48.847 --> 39:49.973
Well, come on!

39:51.391 --> 39:55.270
Jackie, watch the register for me, hon.
- You got it, Earl.

39:55.603 --> 39:56.479
What's going down?

39:56.604 --> 39:58.398
Where are we going, Earl?
- We're going to Ben's.

39:58.523 --> 40:02.986
The phone never just rings at a Police station,
no way, no how.
- Wake up the Sheriff.

40:03.737 --> 40:06.364
Load it up. Come on, come on.

40:54.204 --> 40:55.205
Something?

40:55.497 --> 40:57.707
He's been here.
- How do you know?

41:02.504 --> 41:04.673
This is starting to spook me, doc.

41:04.798 --> 41:06.633
At least I'm not alone.

41:11.096 --> 41:14.808
Logan ... I want you to stay here
in case the family gets back. - Right here, Ben.

41:14.933 --> 41:17.936
You look sharp. You understand?
- No problem, Sheriff.

41:37.789 --> 41:38.999
Hey, you!

41:39.290 --> 41:40.375
This is city property. 

41:40.709 --> 41:42.377
No trespassing.

41:44.838 --> 41:46.297
What are you, deaf?

41:47.716 --> 41:50.135
Don't try that Halloween shit with me.

41:52.220 --> 41:55.890
All right, I'm on the telephone to the Police right now.

41:56.474 --> 41:58.810
Don't you even think about leaving.

42:45.690 --> 42:47.734
Yeah! That was a fun!

42:53.615 --> 42:55.992
Come on, kids, we're going in the car right now.

42:59.162 --> 43:01.206
Come on. I said move in, get in there.

43:03.291 --> 43:04.834
Jamie!

43:22.811 --> 43:24.104
Jamie!

43:53.425 --> 43:55.010
Rachel, is that you?

43:56.052 --> 43:57.470
Is that you?

44:05.937 --> 44:07.063
Jamie? 

44:09.065 --> 44:10.275
Jamie?

44:18.867 --> 44:20.035
Jamie?

44:26.624 --> 44:27.667
Jamie?

44:55.195 --> 44:56.613
Oh, God!

45:06.706 --> 45:07.957
Jamie.

45:25.058 --> 45:26.226
Whoever you are ... 

45:26.351 --> 45:29.104
I have a big dog with me and he bites!

45:32.691 --> 45:33.983
Jamie!

45:36.778 --> 45:38.530
Where have you been?

45:38.655 --> 45:42.117
Don't ever go off on your own at night again.
Okay? Not ever.

45:52.794 --> 45:55.880
Rachel, Jamie, thank God!
- What's going on? - Get in the car.

45:56.006 --> 45:57.424
Come on, quick.

46:10.311 --> 46:11.396
Is that him?

46:12.022 --> 46:13.189
Is that him!?

46:13.481 --> 46:14.524
Yes.

46:17.152 --> 46:18.069
Loomis.

46:24.617 --> 46:26.077
Oh, Christ. Doc.

46:29.205 --> 46:30.332
Dear God.

46:36.004 --> 46:37.339
Hey, don't shoot!

46:39.299 --> 46:41.551
Oh, that was great!
You thought it was me, didn't you?

46:41.676 --> 46:44.763
Sheriff!
- Get home, damn it!

46:44.888 --> 46:46.097
There's a curfew!

46:46.222 --> 46:48.767
I catch your ass, it'll be a weekend in jail!

46:49.934 --> 46:51.394
You all right, doc?

46:52.562 --> 46:55.273
Come on. We'll get to the station.
We'll get these kids safe.

46:57.108 --> 46:58.026
It's okay.

47:01.488 --> 47:02.906
Station, this is 132.
come in, pierce.

47:03.031 --> 47:04.324
Come in, Pierce.

47:05.408 --> 47:06.868
Come in, Pierce.

47:17.170 --> 47:18.963
Oh, Christ!

47:22.050 --> 47:24.177
Wouldn't have given up without a fight.

47:24.886 --> 47:27.263
They didn't know, what they were fighting.

47:50.495 --> 47:53.331
How can a man do this, Loomis?
Tell me.

47:53.748 --> 47:55.291
It isn't a man.

47:56.668 --> 47:58.128
What is he?

47:58.837 --> 47:59.879
Tell me! 

48:00.005 --> 48:01.965
What the hell are we dealing with?

48:02.257 --> 48:03.174
Evil.

48:21.901 --> 48:23.486
What the Sam Hill is going on?

48:23.611 --> 48:27.615
Go on home, Earl. This is Police business.
- What the hell did this?

48:28.033 --> 48:30.285
Looks like to me you're out of business.
Now I want some answers.

48:30.410 --> 48:34.456
I haven't got the time or the patience to argue with you.
Now go home to your families where you belong.

48:37.167 --> 48:41.629
It was Michael Myers.
He's come home to kill.

48:42.672 --> 48:44.007
Let it be, Earl.

48:44.257 --> 48:46.134
Let the Police handle it.

48:46.634 --> 48:48.261
Like the last time?

48:48.636 --> 48:51.056
How many people killed back then?
How many kids?

48:51.181 --> 48:53.600
Al here, lost his boy ten years back.

48:53.725 --> 48:57.062
Well not this time, Ben.
I'll handle this my own way.

48:57.937 --> 48:59.939
We're gonna fry his ass.

49:02.275 --> 49:07.739
You son of a bitch! You just created a lynch mob.
- You haven't got a Police force!

49:08.281 --> 49:11.117
These men may be the only defense you've got.

49:11.451 --> 49:14.037
Ok, let's move it up.
- Come on guys, let's go.

49:14.871 --> 49:17.457
Let's hunt this bastard!
- God help us.

49:31.262 --> 49:34.224
132, 132, this is 134, over.

49:35.100 --> 49:38.228
{y:i}This is 132, over.
- Ben - uh ...

49:38.561 --> 49:40.522
I just heard about the station.

49:40.897 --> 49:45.610
{y:i}Now you go over to my house
and we'll call the state boys from there.
- I'll be there in five minutes.

50:07.215 --> 50:09.384
Honey, I don't think they're home.
- How do you know they are not home?

50:09.509 --> 50:10.927
'Cause the lights are all out.

50:11.052 --> 50:14.014
I told them to be here by 9:30. It's not 9:30 yet.
- Come on, let's call the Carters. 

50:14.139 --> 50:15.765
Come on, come on.
- You call the Carters.

50:15.890 --> 50:18.018
Kids?
Rachel? Jamie?

50:26.901 --> 50:28.445
There he is!

50:33.867 --> 50:35.285
I've seen his face.  

50:35.702 --> 50:37.037
Right there, Al

50:38.038 --> 50:39.748
Right there in the bushes.

51:14.741 --> 51:15.742
Come on.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.543
Shit, Earl!

51:25.669 --> 51:27.420
It's Ted Hollister.

51:30.048 --> 51:32.175
You dumb son of a bitch.

51:32.342 --> 51:34.594
You said, you saw Myers.

51:48.191 --> 51:50.652
Let's go upstairs.
- Huh?

51:50.819 --> 51:51.653
No. 

51:51.986 --> 51:54.072
I think we're doing just fine right here.

52:04.624 --> 52:06.418
Oh, I think I'm in heaven!

52:32.527 --> 52:35.822
Oh, Brady. Oh, Brady.

52:42.495 --> 52:43.496
Oh, shit.

52:44.164 --> 52:47.000
Oh, it's my dad!
- Your dad? Your dad!

52:55.675 --> 52:58.011
God, if he catches us like this ...

52:58.136 --> 53:00.263
... he's gonna skin you alive ...

53:00.388 --> 53:01.598
What? - ... for starters.

53:01.723 --> 53:02.891
Oh, no.

53:04.934 --> 53:06.269
Come on!
- I'm going. I'm going.

53:06.394 --> 53:09.731
Where's that deputy?
- He'll be here in a minute.

53:24.120 --> 53:27.040
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.

53:27.791 --> 53:29.209
Dad, what's going on? 

53:29.334 --> 53:33.296
Kelly, I want you to close
and lock all the downstairs windows.
- Why? - Just do it!

53:33.880 --> 53:37.801
Where's the radio?
- Right through the kitchen you'll see the basement stairs.

53:39.219 --> 53:40.637
Brady, you know how to use a gun? 

53:40.762 --> 53:42.180
Yes, sir.

53:45.809 --> 53:48.520
Think you can handle that?
- Um, yeah. You wanna tell me what's happening?

53:48.645 --> 53:52.357
Yeah, when I have time. You got your riot gun?
- In the trunk of my squad. - Go get it.

53:54.526 --> 53:55.944
Take these.

53:58.363 --> 54:02.492
Okay, you got a hammer ... and roofing nails.
And I want you up in the attic securing it,
so nobody can get in.

54:02.617 --> 54:06.997
You know, if something's happening,
I should just go call my parents.
- Just get up in the attic.

54:07.497 --> 54:08.498
Oh yeah.

54:08.623 --> 54:10.375
I catch you groping my daughter ...

54:10.500 --> 54:12.419
I'll use that shotgun on you.

54:12.544 --> 54:14.004
You understand?

54:41.573 --> 54:43.825
Now get the outside shutters.
- What are we doing?

54:43.950 --> 54:46.244
Making sure that no one can get in here.

54:47.078 --> 54:48.872
Isn't all this a little paranoid?

54:49.664 --> 54:52.625
If you'd seen that Police station,
you wouldn't even ask.

54:59.299 --> 55:00.425
You two okay?

55:01.134 --> 55:02.344
We've been better.

55:03.428 --> 55:04.637
What's going on?

55:05.680 --> 55:07.432
Michael Myers.

55:07.682 --> 55:08.725
Who's that?

55:09.309 --> 55:10.477
Ten years ago ...

55:10.602 --> 55:11.936
Halloween.

55:13.021 --> 55:14.856
He's Jamie's uncle.

55:16.191 --> 55:18.068
The kids at school were right.

55:20.653 --> 55:24.366
I'm gonna be outside ...
upstairs in the attic.

56:23.174 --> 56:25.051
That's all the windows, dad.

56:25.176 --> 56:28.638
All right. Good, good.
Logan, I want you right here by the front door, ok?

56:28.763 --> 56:30.640
This is the dead bolt key.

56:34.477 --> 56:35.353
All right,

56:35.478 --> 56:36.688
We're secure.

56:37.230 --> 56:41.234
I now padlocked the back door.
This is the only way in and out of this house.

56:41.359 --> 56:44.195
You got that?
- You got it, Ben.

56:44.487 --> 56:47.532
I want you to go make us some coffee.
- All right.

56:51.202 --> 56:52.579
Ah, shit!

57:06.968 --> 57:07.886
Hello?

57:13.099 --> 57:14.059
Who's there?

57:27.238 --> 57:29.574
Can we go home soon, Rachel?

57:30.742 --> 57:32.369
Real soon, Jamie.

57:32.744 --> 57:34.412
Now, shh.

57:36.039 --> 57:36.915
How's it powered?

57:37.248 --> 57:41.711
Batteries. I'd planned a generator
for the house next week. I wish I hadn't waited.

57:43.046 --> 57:49.719
This is squawk 79-o-zero Haddonfield broadcasting
on a State Police emergency frequency.
Can anyone hear me?

57:51.513 --> 57:53.348
Can anyone hear me?

57:54.057 --> 57:54.974
Damn it!

59:18.808 --> 59:20.101
Everything all right?

59:20.727 --> 59:21.811
Jamie's sleeping.

59:22.604 --> 59:24.064
When can we go home?

59:24.189 --> 59:26.149
State Police will be here soon.

59:26.358 --> 59:27.942
Not long after that.

59:28.985 --> 59:30.028
Don't worry.

59:30.987 --> 59:32.489
I'm trying.

59:34.491 --> 59:35.992
It won't be long.

59:46.503 --> 59:47.504
I hear someone.

59:47.629 --> 59:51.299
{y:i}Hello, this is Frank Bute over in Tuckerville.
{y:i}You got some kind of emergency? Over.

59:51.424 --> 59:54.636
Thank Christ. This is Ben Meeker,
Sheriff over in Haddonfield.

59:54.761 --> 59:58.723
Our phone and power lines are down
and we have a killer running loose in the street.

59:59.057 --> 01:00:02.435
Michael Myers.
{y:i}- Is this some kind of Halloween prank?

01:00:03.186 --> 01:00:04.396
This is no joke. 

01:00:04.521 --> 01:00:06.606
We need those troopers and we need 'em now.

01:00:06.731 --> 01:00:09.234
{y:i}All right, I'll get the troopers right away.

01:00:09.442 --> 01:00:13.822
{y:i}Hang on. I'll need some information.
- We're not going anywhere, Mr. Bute.

01:00:23.456 --> 01:00:24.416
Rachel ...

01:00:25.166 --> 01:00:26.751
... is your sister all right?

01:00:27.585 --> 01:00:28.712
She's fine.

01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:31.256
Good.

01:00:33.508 --> 01:00:36.678
Sheriff's radioed for help. They'll be here soon.

01:00:36.886 --> 01:00:38.388
Hell of a night.

01:00:38.847 --> 01:00:40.098
It's not over yet.

01:00:41.141 --> 01:00:42.392
Where you going?

01:00:44.144 --> 01:00:45.353
The Corruthers' house. 

01:00:45.478 --> 01:00:48.273
That's where Jamie lives. That's where he'll go.

01:00:48.398 --> 01:00:50.066
Leave Myers for the State boys.

01:00:50.191 --> 01:00:52.736
The State Police won't know how to stop him.

01:00:52.861 --> 01:00:53.820
Do you? 

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:57.407
It might be nobody knows how to stop him.

01:00:57.949 --> 01:00:59.701
But I've got to try.

01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:14.507
Are you looking for this?

01:01:22.265 --> 01:01:24.976
I didn't know you and Brady had anything, okay?

01:01:25.101 --> 01:01:26.227
You knew.

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:28.938
You just didn't care!

01:01:29.314 --> 01:01:31.149
He's not married.

01:01:32.067 --> 01:01:34.736
Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:37.280
Don't you mean, what you do best?

01:01:42.118 --> 01:01:44.621
Wise up to what men want, Rachel.

01:01:44.746 --> 01:01:48.124
Or Brady won't be the last man
you lose to another woman.

01:01:53.338 --> 01:01:54.881
Have some coffee.

01:01:55.548 --> 01:01:58.510
{y:i}Over Alan Gateway shot Ted Hallister by mistake.

01:01:58.635 --> 01:02:01.429
{y:i}Well, is he dead?
{y:i}- Yeah, he's dead.

01:02:01.846 --> 01:02:05.475
Oh, Christ. 04 out there?
This is Ben Meeker.

01:02:06.226 --> 01:02:08.019
Answer me, damn it.

01:02:08.228 --> 01:02:10.522
Sheriff, what is going on out there?

01:02:10.647 --> 01:02:14.275
{y:i}Yeah, I'll swing by with you get my brother John
{y:i}maybe with couple of buddies over there.

01:02:14.401 --> 01:02:16.486
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio.

01:02:16.611 --> 01:02:18.947
The State boys will send word once they're in route.

01:02:19.072 --> 01:02:20.281
When that word comes ... 

01:02:20.407 --> 01:02:22.367
... you go tell deputy Logan.
- Okay.

01:02:22.492 --> 01:02:24.703
Now, you understand?
- Uh huh.

01:02:24.911 --> 01:02:28.206
{y:i}... pick me up in ten minutes.
{y:i}We'll find out what's happening.

01:02:30.917 --> 01:02:33.128
{y:i}You know where the hell Earl's at?

01:02:33.586 --> 01:02:35.672
{y:i}No, I haven't heard from him in a while.

01:02:35.797 --> 01:02:40.260
I'll get Alan Gateway.
I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here.
- Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.

01:02:40.385 --> 01:02:43.471
Hey, I got a town full of beer bellies
running around in the dark with shotguns.

01:02:43.596 --> 01:02:45.181
Who's gonna be next!?

01:02:45.724 --> 01:02:47.475
Somebody's wife? Somebody's kid?

01:02:49.728 --> 01:02:51.479
I can't stand by for that.

01:03:08.621 --> 01:03:09.748
Rachel?

01:03:49.913 --> 01:03:51.998
I thought you might like some coffee.

01:03:58.338 --> 01:04:00.298
It's pretty boring out here.

01:04:04.803 --> 01:04:06.680
I wish they'd fix the power.

01:04:08.014 --> 01:04:11.976
At least we'd have some ...
MTV while we wait for the cavalry.

01:04:42.716 --> 01:04:46.261
{y:i}Haddonfield, we should have cars
{y:i}dispatched in five minutes.

01:04:46.386 --> 01:04:49.139
{y:i}ETA 35 minutes. Over.

01:04:51.641 --> 01:04:53.852
Uh ... okay.

01:04:54.185 --> 01:04:55.937
Great. We'll be waiting.

01:04:56.146 --> 01:04:58.023
{y:i}Ah ten-four. Over.

01:04:59.441 --> 01:05:01.401
Uh ... over and out.

01:05:20.337 --> 01:05:22.047
Deputy Logan.

01:05:26.593 --> 01:05:27.719
Deputy?

01:05:46.237 --> 01:05:47.906
Jamie!

01:05:50.116 --> 01:05:51.159
Oh, God.

01:05:55.455 --> 01:05:56.539
Oh, God.

01:06:02.253 --> 01:06:03.505
What's going on?

01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:06.841
I've gotta find Jamie.
- No, no. What we've gotta do is get out of here ... 

01:06:06.966 --> 01:06:09.469
... right now.
- Not without Jamie! - Look!

01:06:10.679 --> 01:06:13.807
Do you think she stands a chance?
- She's not dead! - No.

01:06:18.853 --> 01:06:20.647
Is there another key?
- I don't know!

01:06:20.772 --> 01:06:22.440
Get out of the way, get out of the way.

01:06:25.777 --> 01:06:27.570
It's metal! Goddammit, it's metal!

01:06:27.696 --> 01:06:29.280
What does that mean?

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.700
We're trapped in this house.

01:06:36.871 --> 01:06:39.874
Jamie!
- Oh, Rachel!

01:06:41.543 --> 01:06:42.377
Rachel ...

01:06:45.296 --> 01:06:46.381
Brady!

01:06:46.506 --> 01:06:47.424
Get back!

01:06:49.175 --> 01:06:51.011
Brady!
- No.

01:06:52.846 --> 01:06:55.557
Son of a bitch!
Shit!

01:06:55.682 --> 01:06:58.059
Brady, come with us!
- Go!

01:06:58.685 --> 01:06:59.769
Brady!

01:07:00.270 --> 01:07:02.188
Get up there, Rachel!

01:07:03.064 --> 01:07:04.065
Shit!

01:07:04.441 --> 01:07:05.650
Brady!

01:07:05.775 --> 01:07:07.110
Get up there, Rachel!

01:07:07.235 --> 01:07:09.654
Brady, come with us!
- Go! - No, Brady!

01:07:14.576 --> 01:07:15.744
Go!

01:07:17.579 --> 01:07:18.371
Shit.

01:07:23.335 --> 01:07:26.504
Rachel, come on! Come on!
- No! I wanna help!

01:07:39.476 --> 01:07:40.894
Brady!
- Rachel, come on!

01:08:06.044 --> 01:08:09.756
Leave us alone!
God, leave us alone!

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:14.803
Jamie!

01:08:30.944 --> 01:08:33.321
Go! Go!

01:08:42.247 --> 01:08:43.372
Rachel!

01:08:51.339 --> 01:08:52.799
Jamie, get down.

01:08:53.258 --> 01:08:54.426
Get down!

01:09:00.015 --> 01:09:01.390
Get on my back, Jamie!
 Hold on.

01:09:01.558 --> 01:09:02.434
Get on.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:03.435
Hold on.

01:09:18.033 --> 01:09:18.950
Hold on ...

01:09:47.770 --> 01:09:49.314
Grab on, Jamie.

01:09:51.191 --> 01:09:52.149
Grab on.

01:10:26.768 --> 01:10:30.689
I want you to get down to the chimney, Jamie.
- I can't! - Well, try. Damn it!

01:10:33.108 --> 01:10:34.275
Rachel!

01:10:48.999 --> 01:10:50.834
I'm gonna lower you down, Jamie. 

01:10:50.959 --> 01:10:51.960
Okay?

01:10:52.085 --> 01:10:54.254
Rachel?
- I've got you. Come on.

01:10:54.504 --> 01:10:55.547
Go down now.

01:10:55.839 --> 01:10:57.841
Rachel.
- I've got you, Jamie.

01:11:03.263 --> 01:11:05.015
I've got you, I've got you!

01:11:36.755 --> 01:11:42.218
Oh, come alive, Rachel! Please, come alive!
Don't be dead! You can't be dead!

01:11:42.844 --> 01:11:45.138
Come alive, Rachel!

01:12:03.198 --> 01:12:04.908
Help!

01:12:05.408 --> 01:12:07.202
Somebody help me!

01:12:07.327 --> 01:12:09.245
Please!

01:12:09.621 --> 01:12:11.081
Help me!

01:12:11.373 --> 01:12:12.832
Please!

01:12:12.957 --> 01:12:14.417
Help me!

01:12:14.959 --> 01:12:17.629
Please!
Somebody help me!

01:12:46.616 --> 01:12:51.830
What are you doing out here alone?
- Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home!
- No. No, you can't. 

01:12:51.955 --> 01:12:55.041
I've just been there.
That's the first place he'll look for you.

01:12:55.458 --> 01:12:57.502
Where's the schoolhouse?

01:12:58.003 --> 01:12:59.546
The schoolhouse.

01:13:00.005 --> 01:13:03.717
Where's the schoolhouse?
- It's over there. - Come on.

01:13:06.136 --> 01:13:07.887
Come.
We'll be safe there.

01:13:26.698 --> 01:13:27.574
Here.

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:44.090
We'll hear some sirens soon.

01:13:44.299 --> 01:13:47.260
Then we'll be safe?
- Yes.

01:13:47.927 --> 01:13:49.888
You don't believe that, do you?

01:13:51.681 --> 01:13:52.640
No.

01:14:03.526 --> 01:14:04.486
No.

01:14:06.363 --> 01:14:08.907
No!
Oh, please!

01:14:09.741 --> 01:14:11.618
Somebody help me!

01:14:12.327 --> 01:14:13.620
No!

01:15:35.201 --> 01:15:37.662
In the school!
Pull over, Earl.

01:15:46.671 --> 01:15:49.174
What's going on here? We heard the alarm.
- He's inside!

01:15:49.299 --> 01:15:51.509
Jesus. Where?
- In the school!

01:15:56.514 --> 01:15:58.099
Let's get this bastard!

01:15:58.224 --> 01:15:59.392
No! 

01:15:59.559 --> 01:16:00.935
He'll kill you too.

01:16:01.061 --> 01:16:03.980
We have to get out of Haddonfield
the State Police are on their way. Let them handle it.

01:16:04.105 --> 01:16:07.442
I don't know about you Earl, but that makes sense to me.
Let's get the hell out!

01:16:07.567 --> 01:16:11.321
He's not our patient. Let the troopers have it.
That's what they get paid for.

01:16:11.654 --> 01:16:14.532
Screw it. Let's get out of here.
Al.

01:16:47.065 --> 01:16:48.525
Okay, everybody, listen up.

01:16:48.650 --> 01:16:51.319
I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck.

01:16:51.444 --> 01:16:52.612
I'm taking them out of town ... 

01:16:52.737 --> 01:16:55.991
... route 410. State Police are on the way.

01:16:56.658 --> 01:16:58.618
You got that?
{y:i}- Got it, Earl.
- Okay, out.

01:17:14.134 --> 01:17:15.677
There's the cavalry.

01:17:31.484 --> 01:17:35.530
Coming out of Haddonfield?
- Yeah. Myers is in the elementary school.
We're taking these kids to safety.

01:17:35.655 --> 01:17:38.783
Okay, there's a highway patrol substation
about four miles down the highway.

01:17:38.908 --> 01:17:40.285
You'll see the turnoff signs.

01:17:40.410 --> 01:17:43.204
There we've got officers on duty.
They'll take care of you.

01:17:43.330 --> 01:17:44.164
Thanks.

01:17:53.631 --> 01:17:54.716
It's gonna be okay.

01:19:46.578 --> 01:19:47.537
Jamie!

01:20:25.325 --> 01:20:26.117
Die ... 

01:20:26.409 --> 01:20:29.704
you ... son of a bitch!

01:21:06.074 --> 01:21:08.702
Jamie, I want you to stay right here in the truck!

01:21:20.296 --> 01:21:23.717
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
- Calm down, calm down. Are you all right? 

01:21:23.842 --> 01:21:26.553
Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine. - Where's Jamie?

01:21:33.018 --> 01:21:33.977
Jamie! 

01:21:34.394 --> 01:21:36.855
Get away!
- Don't touch him, Jamie!

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:45.613
Get down!

01:22:35.955 --> 01:22:37.082
Oh, babies!

01:22:46.341 --> 01:22:48.134
It's over.
- Yes.

01:22:49.427 --> 01:22:51.429
Michael Myers is in hell ...

01:22:51.930 --> 01:22:52.681
buried ...

01:22:52.806 --> 01:22:54.265
Where he belongs.

01:22:56.101 --> 01:22:58.353
These kids aren't likely to forget.

01:22:58.478 --> 01:23:00.689
They've survived this ordeal,

01:23:01.606 --> 01:23:03.775
they'll survive it's memory.

01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:06.486
I'm going to take Jamie upstairs.

01:23:07.237 --> 01:23:09.072
Stay with Rachel.

01:23:09.197 --> 01:23:10.281
Come on, honey.

01:24:12.635 --> 01:24:14.512
No. 

01:24:15.013 --> 01:24:16.473
No!

01:24:17.182 --> 01:24:18.558
No! 

01:24:19.309 --> 01:24:29.402
No! No! No! No!
No! No!

01:24:36.534 --> 01:24:37.994
No.
