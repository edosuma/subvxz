What I've come to tell you
today, Mrs. Maitland...

43:07.249 --> 43:09.041
is that there have been
certain developments

43:09.124 --> 43:12.166
in the Frankie Peterson
homicide case.

43:13.999 --> 43:17.999
Some new avenues of inquiry
have opened.

43:25.166 --> 43:26.541
We're reopening the case.

43:31.667 --> 43:33.667
What about your slam dunk
forensics?

43:35.750 --> 43:37.917
Well, we reexamined
the perp DNA

43:37.999 --> 43:40.416
we got from the crime scene
and discovered that

43:40.500 --> 43:43.583
what we actually had
was a mixture of samples,

43:43.667 --> 43:44.875
perp and the victim,

43:44.958 --> 43:46.124
which makes it unreliable
in court.

43:46.208 --> 43:49.249
Girls, I need you
to go upstairs, please.

43:59.625 --> 44:02.291
On Monday, I'm holding
a press conference

44:02.375 --> 44:04.875
to announce the reopening
of the investigation...

44:06.541 --> 44:12.041
and to officially go on record
regarding the dropping

44:12.124 --> 44:13.875
of charges
against Terry Maitland.

44:17.999 --> 44:19.541
Your family has suffered enough,

44:19.625 --> 44:22.208
and I just want to do
whatever I...

44:29.208 --> 44:33.792
Because of your pending lawsuits
against me and my office...

44:35.750 --> 44:38.083
I have to refrain
from telling you

44:38.708 --> 44:40.083
what is in my heart.

44:42.750 --> 44:44.083

MAYA MAITLAND:
Was he mean to you?

45:05.625 --> 45:07.249
No, my love,
he wasn't mean to me.

45:38.541 --> 45:39.667
Flying or driving?

45:40.625 --> 45:41.625
HOLLY: Driving.

45:44.291 --> 45:46.541
About ten hours, right? Chicago?

45:46.625 --> 45:47.750
-Yeah.
-Ten hours?

45:47.833 --> 45:51.958
I have a couple of stops
I have to make along the way.

45:53.999 --> 45:56.166
RALPH: You know, I wouldn't mind
teaming up again,

45:56.249 --> 45:58.416
the opportunity ever arose.

45:58.500 --> 46:00.166
I mean,
preferably on something simple

46:00.249 --> 46:02.999
like a gangland triple homicide.
Something like that.

46:05.041 --> 46:06.999
When I was in the caves,

46:07.083 --> 46:10.375
El Cuco asked me,
uh, why I was so open

46:10.458 --> 46:12.375
to believing in its existence.

46:14.875 --> 46:17.875
My father was ex-military
and when I was little,

46:17.958 --> 46:20.999
he would say,
"A man knows a man."

46:22.999 --> 46:26.625
Well, if I had the time
to think in that cave

46:26.708 --> 46:29.375
and the inclination to answer
that thing,

46:29.458 --> 46:30.792
I would have said...

46:32.166 --> 46:34.667
"An outsider knows an outsider."

RALPH: I never told you but...
I saw Derek.

48:25.625 --> 48:27.958
He... spoke to me.

-JEANNIE: What did he say?
-RALPH: Well, it--

48:31.458 --> 48:33.875
it wasn't Derek, so...

48:33.958 --> 48:36.625
Ralph-- Tell me what he said.
Just humor me.

48:39.083 --> 48:41.333
He said that I need
to let him go.

48:44.041 --> 48:45.124
Let him go?

48:47.708 --> 48:50.833
-Well, fat chance of that.
-(CHUCKLES)

49:00.166 --> 49:01.667
I don't know.

49:01.750 --> 49:04.333
I like to think the way
this whole experience...

49:06.833 --> 49:08.124
cracked the world open.

49:09.833 --> 49:11.541
Maybe the next time he appears,

49:12.458 --> 49:14.375
maybe it's gonna be
the real Derek.

49:16.166 --> 49:18.833
Or maybe after a few years pass,

49:19.667 --> 49:20.792
many more years,

49:21.541 --> 49:22.875
we'll just go visit him.
