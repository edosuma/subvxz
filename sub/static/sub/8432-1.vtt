Jesus! He's got my purse!

03:21.326 --> 03:22.373
Stop him!

03:26.915 --> 03:28.963
Hey, you! Come back here!

05:00.342 --> 05:01.343
Yo.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.094
Come on.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.651
You got it all?

05:18.235 --> 05:19.908
Everything.

05:35.627 --> 05:36.753
Damn.

05:39.589 --> 05:40.966
We're rich.

05:43.051 --> 05:46.271
You hear that? We're rich, man.

06:30.599 --> 06:31.600
Ma?

06:46.489 --> 06:47.706
I'm with a friend.

06:49.618 --> 06:51.040
You certainly are.

07:17.062 --> 07:19.565
I gotta take care of some business.

07:23.318 --> 07:25.366
I gotta see my stockbroker.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.459
Okay. Let's go. Come on.

07:32.035 --> 07:33.127
Out with Paco.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.251
You're going to bed right now!
That's where you're going.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.377
No.

07:38.375 --> 07:41.754
Yo, listen to her, all right?
I'll take you out tomorrow, okay?

07:43.046 --> 07:44.172
All right.

08:00.438 --> 08:02.361
Honey, can you turn it down a little?

08:31.011 --> 08:32.729
Paco, your old man.

08:58.455 --> 09:02.005
Look, I don't want a job. I want a business.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.540
We deliver Saturday night, 9:00.

09:42.332 --> 09:44.835
Parking lot around the corner
from the Marshall theater.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.006
All you guys gotta do is...

09:46.086 --> 09:47.133
Paco!

09:50.673 --> 09:51.674
Put it down!

09:52.467 --> 09:53.684
Put it down!

09:55.261 --> 09:57.935
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

09:59.182 --> 10:00.729
Why you fucking with me?

10:01.976 --> 10:03.319
Let me tell you something.

10:04.020 --> 10:07.650
You pull any shit like this Saturday night,
I swear to God...

10:10.235 --> 10:12.909
Look, man, I'm not playing with you.
You hear me?

10:12.904 --> 10:14.906
Get the fuck out of here!

10:20.537 --> 10:21.538
Barn!

11:04.247 --> 11:05.669
Hey, J.C.

11:05.748 --> 11:06.920
Carl.

11:12.130 --> 11:16.101
I've never seen so much shit in my life.
They got a fucking drugstore.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.765
How're you doing, J.C.?

11:23.349 --> 11:25.477
What do you see in this guy, huh?

11:26.603 --> 11:28.276
Fuck off, Moreno.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.154
Your old lady's got a bad mouth.
If she was my old lady...

11:32.150 --> 11:34.403
- She's not, asshole.
- Oh, wow.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.284
You mean she didn't tell you
about me and her, huh?

11:38.156 --> 11:40.284
Don't listen to that stupid...

11:40.783 --> 11:42.877
Adios, douche bag.

12:29.999 --> 12:32.718
Hey, wake up.

12:33.294 --> 12:36.218
- I gotta get up. I gotta go.
- No.

12:38.049 --> 12:41.349
Your old man will be back soon. I gotta go.

12:42.136 --> 12:43.388
Mick.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.203
Remember Tony Contreras?

13:08.162 --> 13:10.005
- Who?
- The guy with the bike.

13:14.502 --> 13:17.881
He got killed ripping off some house
in Park Ridge last week.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.141
That guy?

13:21.718 --> 13:23.186
That's the way it goes.

13:24.095 --> 13:26.723
I had this dream that you went away.

13:27.432 --> 13:28.604
SO did I.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.726
With you.

13:32.103 --> 13:33.901
I went over to your house looking for you.

13:33.980 --> 13:38.326
Your mother opened the door.
She didn't say anything, so I went inside.

13:38.609 --> 13:42.409
And there you were,
lying in this coffin in a red suit.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.875
I don't have a red suit.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.921
You have the strangest dreams.

13:51.706 --> 13:53.299
What were you and Brennan talking about?

13:53.875 --> 13:55.252
Carl? Nothing.

13:57.462 --> 13:58.463
Nothing!

13:58.880 --> 14:00.132
Someday

14:01.007 --> 14:02.805
you're gonna get busted for real.

14:02.800 --> 14:06.100
So what? They don't do shit.
You know what they do?

14:06.929 --> 14:09.557
They take you down there
and they give you lunch.

14:10.224 --> 14:13.603
Then, they're gonna call my old lady.
They're not gonna find her.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.989
Send me home for her supper,
which isn't as good as their lunch.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.107
It's a joke.

14:18.608 --> 14:19.905
I don't want you to die.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.119
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

14:23.988 --> 14:24.989
I love you.

14:38.461 --> 14:39.553
Don't dream.

14:44.801 --> 14:47.179
Are you sure they won't know who we are?

14:47.261 --> 14:48.683
Not if you do what I say.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.517
You keep your fucking mouth shut,

14:53.518 --> 14:55.316
they won't know shit.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.081
Jesus.

15:15.790 --> 15:17.417
Don't be such a pussy.

15:18.376 --> 15:21.004
We're gonna be in and out of there so fast...

15:21.879 --> 15:23.927
You're not gonna have to use that.

15:24.006 --> 15:25.223
Like that.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.397
What are you doing in here?

16:21.481 --> 16:23.825
You promised me I can go out with you.

16:24.984 --> 16:28.113
Yeah. Not tonight.

16:28.196 --> 16:31.575
We got something to do, it's very important.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.747
I don't want you in the way.

16:35.077 --> 16:38.456
I'll take you to a movie.
Tomorrow, we'll go out, we'll hang out.

16:38.539 --> 16:41.167
All right? Right now, you go home.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.135
But you promised.

16:43.211 --> 16:45.339
Man, don't play with me.
I'm not playing with you. Stop it.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.219
Go home. Get out of here.

17:07.401 --> 17:09.619
Just make sure them guns are ready,
all right?

17:09.694 --> 17:12.039
Believe me, they're going to be ready.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.915
Check this out, man.

17:24.961 --> 17:26.304
Bad motherfucker.

17:43.104 --> 17:44.606
There's Moreno's kid brother.

17:47.525 --> 17:50.074
Relax, Carl. It's gonna be all right.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.244
Okay.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.340
There they are.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.344
Let's go.

19:06.228 --> 19:08.481
Rough neighborhood.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.004
Slow down, slow down.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.081
I'm slowing down.

19:28.292 --> 19:30.135
There's the boys. Right there.

19:30.211 --> 19:32.305
Party time now.

19:33.422 --> 19:34.924
Okay, over here. Carl, over here.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.141
Okay, okay.

19:36.133 --> 19:37.259
Okay.

19:51.524 --> 19:54.277
- Shit. What's with the dude?
- Hey, man. He got a gun.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.657
- Get his ass, man. Get him.
- Go.

20:01.992 --> 20:03.960
Mick, look out!

20:09.041 --> 20:10.042
Hold up, man.

20:11.419 --> 20:12.466
We got to move.

20:13.671 --> 20:14.672
Let's go!

20:22.638 --> 20:24.231
Let's go! Let's go!

20:31.981 --> 20:33.904
Carl! Carl!

20:59.800 --> 21:01.347
We heard shots.

21:26.368 --> 21:27.915
Fuck!

21:29.455 --> 21:30.832
Fuck!

21:37.713 --> 21:39.556
Don't move, in there!

21:48.390 --> 21:49.733
Michael O'Brien,

21:50.184 --> 21:53.905
you have committed the crimes of an adult.

21:54.188 --> 21:57.567
Your previous record of arrests is extensive

21:58.400 --> 22:01.574
and indicates a sociopathic personality.

22:03.239 --> 22:05.412
However; you are protected by the law.

22:06.367 --> 22:08.586
Your status as a juvenile prevents me

22:08.577 --> 22:11.046
from imposing the punishment you deserve.

22:11.664 --> 22:15.259
And until our criminal codes
are revised to incorporate

22:15.251 --> 22:18.926
a more realistic definition
of juvenile offenders,

22:18.921 --> 22:21.140
society will continue to suffer

22:22.633 --> 22:25.011
It is the judgment of this court

22:25.094 --> 22:28.849
that you be committed to
Rainford Juvenile Correctional Facility

22:29.348 --> 22:32.818
until such a time
as your rehabilitation is complete.

23:12.433 --> 23:15.152
Terrell, O'Brien, let's go.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.421
Welcome to Rainford, gentlemen.

23:42.671 --> 23:45.015
My name is Gene Daniels.
I'm one of your supervisors.

23:45.007 --> 23:48.386
Call me Mr. Daniels. I like that.
Don't call me anything else.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.473
You've been assigned to Dorm C.

23:53.849 --> 23:55.772
That's our special circumstances dormitory

23:55.851 --> 23:57.945
for critical offenders.

23:58.729 --> 24:01.403
Your fellow inmates are murderers,

24:02.024 --> 24:03.867
armed robbers, rapists,

24:05.194 --> 24:06.787
and mental defectives.

24:07.196 --> 24:09.540
Just like yourselves,
they've graduated top of the class.

24:10.366 --> 24:13.245
You will be treated with respect
if you treat others with respect.

24:13.327 --> 24:17.252
I suggest you stay cool
and follow all the rules.

24:20.376 --> 24:23.596
Your crime is not that you got caught,

24:23.671 --> 24:25.799
but the crime itself.

24:26.757 --> 24:28.304
Remember that.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.723
Hopefully, you will realize
that what you did was wrong.

24:35.641 --> 24:38.190
Hopefully, you will never do
anything like that again.

24:41.730 --> 24:43.232
This is a juvenile facility.

24:43.857 --> 24:48.033
That means you are not
in charge of the zoo, we are.

24:49.154 --> 24:50.872
If you think you're hip, you're not.

24:52.408 --> 24:54.581
If you were, you wouldn't be here.

24:56.245 --> 24:57.542
Have I made myself understood?

25:00.416 --> 25:02.339
"Yes, Mr. Daniels."

25:03.419 --> 25:05.012
- Yes, Mr. Daniels.
- Yes, Mr. Daniels.

25:06.088 --> 25:07.556
That's better.

25:11.593 --> 25:13.266
Let's go, gentlemen.

25:25.065 --> 25:26.442
Wagner.

25:32.448 --> 25:34.166
YMCA time!

25:37.036 --> 25:38.959
Hey, check them out!

25:40.998 --> 25:42.750
- Over here!
- Hey, beautiful.

25:57.806 --> 25:59.149
Little one's cute.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.446
O'Brien. Hey.

26:13.072 --> 26:15.325
All right. This is Supervisor Wagner.

26:15.324 --> 26:16.826
"Sir" will also do.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.252
O'Brien. Terrell.

26:18.952 --> 26:21.751
Gentlemen, enjoy your rehabilitation.

26:23.332 --> 26:25.960
Hey, the man is over here.

26:29.171 --> 26:30.593
You boys read?

26:31.340 --> 26:32.387
Read this.

26:33.675 --> 26:35.894
Gang activity, 1,000 points.

26:35.886 --> 26:38.514
Sexual harassment, 1 ,200.

26:38.514 --> 26:42.018
Fighting, 700. Drugs and/or alcohol, 1,500.

26:42.101 --> 26:45.446
Running for the fence, 2,000. Smoking, 400.

26:50.025 --> 26:52.528
Okay, Terrell, you take room number 35
up on top,

26:52.528 --> 26:54.906
and, O'Brien,
you take room number 14 on the bottom.

26:54.988 --> 26:56.080
Come on, let's go!

27:00.202 --> 27:02.705
Hey, check it out. It's Batman and Robin.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.676
I want the little dude.

28:00.429 --> 28:02.727
So, how do you like it so far?

28:12.316 --> 28:13.613
You got a name?

28:15.444 --> 28:17.037
Can you talk?

28:23.243 --> 28:24.460
Smoke?

28:31.668 --> 28:32.840
My name is Horowitz.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.672
You don't feel like talking
right now, that's okay.

28:34.755 --> 28:36.132
I understand.

28:36.798 --> 28:40.018
But you understand I really don't
want a fucking mute in my cell.

28:40.010 --> 28:42.479
'Cause I like a little conversation
sometimes, okay?

28:48.894 --> 28:51.067
Last guy that was in here with me
killed himself

28:51.146 --> 28:53.023
by drinking a half a gallon of disinfectant,

28:53.023 --> 28:54.900
he liked the place so much.

29:04.034 --> 29:05.331
My name is O'Brien.

29:07.913 --> 29:10.712
Shit. A fucking mick.

29:57.421 --> 29:58.422
No!

30:03.677 --> 30:04.678
No.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.080
So, what's the toke?

30:34.374 --> 30:35.751
An accident.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.340
Yeah, me, too.

30:38.253 --> 30:41.382
I firebombed the bowling alley,
killed three people.

30:41.757 --> 30:45.728
I was goofing around with some girls.
Their boyfriends didn't like it too much,

30:46.053 --> 30:47.646
beat the shit out of me.

30:47.721 --> 30:50.645
Came back the next night, totaled the place.

30:52.434 --> 30:55.563
Only thing was,
I wasted the wrong three people.

31:05.947 --> 31:08.826
Well, time to get counted.

31:11.453 --> 31:13.126
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:18.585 --> 31:20.553
Get in line, asshole.

31:22.756 --> 31:26.181
- Just get in line. Get in line.
- That's Lofgren.

31:26.176 --> 31:28.178
They can him "Viking."

31:28.178 --> 31:30.397
I Call him "Shit-for-brains."

31:31.640 --> 31:34.109
Shut your fucking mouth, Horowitz.

31:38.397 --> 31:40.650
Come on, get in line. Let's go, let's go.
Come on, wake up, wake up.

31:40.732 --> 31:41.949
- Get in line, get in line.

31:42.776 --> 31:44.824
Get in line, get in line. Come on.

Get in line, man.

31:48.323 --> 31:51.202
You, too, man. Move! Get in line!

31:51.993 --> 31:55.463
Come on, move it, move it.
Let's get in line. You, too.

31:59.167 --> 32:00.760
That's Tweety.

32:00.836 --> 32:02.179
Nice name.

32:11.471 --> 32:12.939
They're smacks.

32:13.640 --> 32:17.736
They keep the rest of the animals in line
and give out the work assignments.

32:17.811 --> 32:20.906
They're gonna put you on shithouse patrol.

32:20.897 --> 32:24.777
All accounted for, Mr. Daniels.

32:25.527 --> 32:27.825
All right, that's five minutes to first bell.

32:28.238 --> 32:29.706
Five minutes.

33:26.546 --> 33:27.889
What happened to your face?

33:31.468 --> 33:32.594
Hey, fuckhead!

33:34.596 --> 33:36.223
What's it to you?

33:37.641 --> 33:38.893
I asked you a question.

33:40.769 --> 33:42.021
I cut myself shaving.

33:45.941 --> 33:48.319
I got news for you, fuckhead.

33:49.569 --> 33:51.788
In here, me and him,

33:52.822 --> 33:54.119
we're it.

33:56.743 --> 33:59.838
You're on shithouse patrol
until we say different. You got it?

34:53.466 --> 34:54.842
Clean it up.

35:29.377 --> 35:30.378
Smokes?

35:31.963 --> 35:34.386
Winstone, Pall Malls, Salems.

35:34.549 --> 35:35.721
Salems.

35:40.764 --> 35:41.856
Ten bucks.

35:42.307 --> 35:43.433
I don't have it.

35:44.309 --> 35:45.401
Take it or leave it.

35:45.727 --> 35:49.106
Perretti, you want your radio fixed?
Give him the smokes.

35:49.898 --> 35:51.900
Horowitz, you suck!

35:52.484 --> 35:54.532
Only your mother, Perretti.

36:00.367 --> 36:03.496
Grass? You need some grass, I got it.

36:03.787 --> 36:05.289
Don't buy it. It's shit.

36:12.420 --> 36:16.516
Horowitz, you better have it ready by Friday.

36:17.884 --> 36:19.386
Or your ass is grass.

36:19.761 --> 36:20.933
Don't worry about it.

36:39.614 --> 36:41.491
The chink killed his father.

36:41.491 --> 36:43.539
The whop snatched a 14-year-old girl

36:43.618 --> 36:46.292
and raped her for two days straight
in a basement.

36:46.913 --> 36:50.292
They run the action for the Viking
and Tweety on a 60-40 split.

36:51.292 --> 36:52.635
Real cuties.

37:04.264 --> 37:05.641
Ain't he sweet.

37:22.031 --> 37:24.159
All right, guys, loosen up a little bit.

37:34.461 --> 37:35.678
How you doing?

37:35.670 --> 37:39.015
Not too good.
They're gonna get me, Mick. I know it.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.531
I'll be right back.

38:06.367 --> 38:07.960
I wrote Mick today.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.589
Started at least 10 times.

38:11.664 --> 38:15.589
You know, "How are you?
What's it like there?"

38:16.294 --> 38:18.046
That kind of thing.

38:23.009 --> 38:25.103
Everything sounded so dumb.

38:28.389 --> 38:30.608
Honey, listen to me.

38:32.894 --> 38:34.441
He's a bad kid.

38:35.647 --> 38:38.275
He's been in and out of trouble for years.

38:38.358 --> 38:39.905
Now, he's finally gone and killed someone.

38:39.901 --> 38:41.073
No.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.372
It was an accident.

38:52.747 --> 38:56.752
I see you're responsible
for the death of an eight-year-old boy.

38:59.254 --> 39:00.847
It was an accident.

39:02.382 --> 39:04.134
An accident.

39:05.385 --> 39:07.387
How about these other charges?

39:07.470 --> 39:09.598
"Driving a stolen vehicle,
assault with a deadly weapon,

39:09.681 --> 39:11.433
"attempted robbery."

39:12.392 --> 39:14.690
I suppose they were accidents, too.

39:16.896 --> 39:20.446
Possession of a handgun
and assaulting a teacher at 12.

39:21.442 --> 39:25.788
Four counts of vandalism,
three counts of breaking and entering at 13.

39:27.282 --> 39:31.253
Assaulting a 70-year-old woman
during a purse snatching at 14.

39:32.704 --> 39:34.251
You're a real class act.

39:35.290 --> 39:36.291
You want me to go on?

39:39.294 --> 39:43.015
How you never did any time here before

39:43.089 --> 39:44.466
is a miracle.

39:45.842 --> 39:48.436
And now you're telling me
what just happened was an accident?

39:50.013 --> 39:51.310
Hey, boy,

39:52.473 --> 39:54.475
let me tell you something.

39:56.769 --> 39:58.567
That was no accident.

40:00.648 --> 40:02.446
You would've killed somebody
sooner or later.

40:03.943 --> 40:05.570
Only it happened sooner, you see?

40:06.070 --> 40:08.914
So, don't bullshit yourself.
Don't bullshit me.

40:16.915 --> 40:19.509
How do you feel about what went down?

40:20.460 --> 40:22.303
About the so-called accident?

40:27.634 --> 40:28.760
I'd like an answer.

40:29.969 --> 40:31.266
I don't have one.

40:31.846 --> 40:36.067
Well, when you do have an answer,
let me know.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.609
Because I'm interested.

40:42.190 --> 40:44.659
Anytime you wanna talk about this,

40:46.444 --> 40:48.071
or anything else,

40:49.113 --> 40:50.365
I'm here.

40:53.576 --> 40:55.374
Thank you, Eddie.

40:56.704 --> 40:58.172
Gerard!

41:00.541 --> 41:02.339
- Holden!
- Right here.

41:03.711 --> 41:07.056
Jones! Is there anybody here
by the name of Jones?

41:10.635 --> 41:11.887
Perretti!

41:15.139 --> 41:16.391
Johnson!

41:18.851 --> 41:20.569
- O'Brien!
- Yeah.

41:21.396 --> 41:24.491
Fucking miracle
someone you know can write.

41:26.150 --> 41:27.197
Jones!

41:47.755 --> 41:49.132
Turn around.

41:50.174 --> 41:52.051
Come on, man. Come on.

42:07.525 --> 42:09.027
Hey, Paco, that's him.

42:09.235 --> 42:10.782
That's the one.

42:11.320 --> 42:12.446
That's the guy.

42:16.784 --> 42:18.502
Hey, what was that?

42:18.619 --> 42:20.667
Someone wasted Willy, man!

42:21.330 --> 42:23.628
Get the license plate, man.
Get the license plate!

42:24.459 --> 42:26.587
Somebody call an ambulance.

42:27.420 --> 42:28.546
Man, that's a lot of blood.

42:28.629 --> 42:31.007
Man, he's bleeding bad, man.
He's bleeding bad!

42:31.090 --> 42:32.842
Jimmy, come here!

42:32.842 --> 42:35.186
Oh, man! Guess he's dead.

43:29.190 --> 43:30.817
What do you want?

43:32.026 --> 43:35.030
Just get the fuck out of here!
Leave me alone!

43:36.030 --> 43:37.247
Come on! Please, man!

44:05.685 --> 44:07.062
How was it?

44:08.312 --> 44:11.612
- Fucking asshole!
- Tweety! Tweety, he's got a knife!

44:31.460 --> 44:32.928
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

44:33.254 --> 44:35.131
- He's dead.
- He's dead?

44:35.840 --> 44:36.932
Let's get out of here.

44:36.924 --> 44:39.552
Let's go, come on. Come on, let's go.

45:02.575 --> 45:05.203
One way or the other,

45:06.913 --> 45:09.086
I'm going to get to the bottom of this.

45:11.751 --> 45:13.753
You're on cooking detail all day.

45:14.962 --> 45:16.964
I'm gonna check with Axelrod.

45:16.964 --> 45:19.808
If you're lying to me,
I'm gonna deep-fry your ass.

45:19.800 --> 45:24.431
Tell me exactly what happened
when you ran out on the tier. Exactly.

45:24.805 --> 45:28.230
I just turned and
I saw a bunch of people out on the rail.

45:28.309 --> 45:30.027
Who were the people next to you?

45:30.686 --> 45:34.862
So, you're telling me that
you don't remember if you saw anything?

45:34.941 --> 45:36.989
Buy you... You were there, right?

45:38.110 --> 45:40.158
Get out of here. Just get out of here.

45:42.823 --> 45:46.168
Now, turn the chair around and sit down
and talk to me.

45:46.953 --> 45:48.671
Now, where were you?

45:48.663 --> 45:50.336
I was in my room sleeping, like I told you.

45:50.414 --> 45:51.916
No, you weren't.

45:57.171 --> 45:59.390
- And that's all you can tell me?
- That's all.

46:00.049 --> 46:01.426
All right.

46:02.843 --> 46:04.095
You're up.

46:07.765 --> 46:11.269
I know, Lofgren, I know.
You're incurably innocent.

46:12.603 --> 46:13.820
Yeah.

46:14.855 --> 46:16.107
Okay.

46:24.865 --> 46:29.917
O'Brien, if you saw anything
that might help clear this up,

46:29.996 --> 46:32.419
it might knock some time off your sentence.

46:33.791 --> 46:35.043
I can't help you, sir.

46:36.711 --> 46:39.464
- That's it?
- Yeah, sir.

46:46.095 --> 46:49.816
There are these three girls standing outside
the bowling alley, right?

46:49.890 --> 46:52.143
I figure I'd give it a shot.

46:52.226 --> 46:54.479
I walk over, I start talking to them.

46:58.733 --> 47:00.030
Take off.

47:12.038 --> 47:13.881
What'd you say to him?

47:17.835 --> 47:19.087
Not much.

47:20.421 --> 47:22.765
When I ask you a question, you answer.
You dig, motherfucker?

47:22.757 --> 47:24.930
- Go fuck yourself.
- I'm gonna fuck you up.

47:24.925 --> 47:26.848
Hey, you got a problem?

47:34.101 --> 47:36.149
Gentlemen, there's seconds
for those of you who want it.

47:37.563 --> 47:39.031
Now, let's try to be dignified.

48:02.004 --> 48:04.757
Mr. Wagner, here's the mop.

49:52.990 --> 49:55.413
- What are you doing?
- It's okay. Get out of here.

50:00.080 --> 50:03.175
- Look, man, if there's gonna be trouble...
- it's okay.

50:27.816 --> 50:29.068
Hey, sou m bag.

50:33.739 --> 50:34.831
Oh, shit.

50:38.577 --> 50:41.126
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

51:04.812 --> 51:06.155
Come on!

51:09.858 --> 51:11.155
Let's go!

51:57.865 --> 51:59.162
Hi, J.C.

52:41.742 --> 52:42.789
Hey.

52:44.662 --> 52:46.209
- You feel it?
- What?

52:47.331 --> 52:48.708
You're it.

52:49.249 --> 52:50.967
What are you talking about?

52:51.043 --> 52:53.592
You're the new barn boss, O'Brien.

52:53.587 --> 52:54.759
Says who?

52:54.755 --> 52:56.632
Hey, it is what it is.

52:56.715 --> 52:58.137
Fuck that.

52:58.133 --> 52:59.259
What are you afraid of?

52:59.343 --> 53:01.641
I ain't afraid of anything.
I just don't want to be it.

53:01.720 --> 53:04.815
Hey, after what you did to
Viking and Tweety, man, you're it.

53:06.934 --> 53:07.981
Hey, schmuck.

53:08.060 --> 53:10.483
- What?
- Think of it as a present.

53:10.562 --> 53:11.688
Some present.

53:12.022 --> 53:14.491
Barn boss gets 40 % of the cigarette action.

53:14.566 --> 53:16.193
You forgot.

53:16.276 --> 53:20.247
Barn boss gets to give out
the work assignments and take his own.

53:21.573 --> 53:24.326
Barn boss gets time off his sentence
if he stays cool

53:24.326 --> 53:26.829
and keeps the Neanderthals in line.

53:27.121 --> 53:30.546
You didn't know that, did you?
Think you can handle it?

53:32.459 --> 53:36.305
And as your lieutenant,
I get some privileges, too.

53:42.970 --> 53:44.313
Banzai!

53:47.015 --> 53:48.392
Every week,

53:51.687 --> 53:53.530
two cartons for me

53:55.399 --> 53:57.197
and two for Horowitz.

53:59.069 --> 54:00.195
Free.

54:04.742 --> 54:06.665
There's something else.

54:12.040 --> 54:14.668
You know how it used to be a 60-40 split?

54:16.503 --> 54:18.130
Well, it Still is.

54:19.256 --> 54:23.511
Only now, it's 60-40.

54:28.724 --> 54:30.351
Get out of here.

55:05.135 --> 55:06.432
Hey, man.

55:07.221 --> 55:09.223
You're something else, O'Brien.

55:10.599 --> 55:12.897
- Mick.
- You're it, man.

55:14.728 --> 55:17.322
- Excuse me. Make way for the man.
- You're it now.

55:20.067 --> 55:21.660
Go ahead, O'Brien.

55:28.450 --> 55:29.952
What is that shit?

55:29.952 --> 55:32.751
"Poise and control."

55:32.746 --> 55:34.293
Oh, God.

55:36.291 --> 55:38.214
- Shut up.
- Shoot.

55:39.253 --> 55:40.971
- Shut up.
- You don't know nothing.

55:40.963 --> 55:42.089
Be cool.

55:43.090 --> 55:45.684
Perretti, read the sentence to the class.

55:47.219 --> 55:48.892
"The domi...

55:51.598 --> 55:53.271
"The dom... Dominant..."

55:54.518 --> 55:57.362
- The dumb what?
- "The dominant..."

55:57.437 --> 55:59.940
- The dumb ass.
- "Primordial..."

55:59.940 --> 56:02.489
- "The dominant..."
- Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Lofgren.

56:02.568 --> 56:04.536
- Oh.
- "Dominant..."

56:05.654 --> 56:08.077
- "Primer... Primer..."
- What?

56:08.448 --> 56:11.327
- "Primer..."
- All right. O'Brien.

56:11.326 --> 56:12.578
You try.

56:13.495 --> 56:16.795
- Come on, Mick.
- "The dominant prim..."

56:17.958 --> 56:21.633
- You don't know...
- "Primer..."

56:23.797 --> 56:26.516
Johnson. Read it.

56:30.178 --> 56:32.806
Hey, look, this is nothing to laugh at.

56:32.890 --> 56:35.188
Now, maybe if some of you could read,
you wouldn't be in here.

56:35.809 --> 56:37.152
You ever think about that?

56:38.437 --> 56:39.859
Look, you think of yourself as a moron,

56:39.938 --> 56:42.532
you can't feel that good about yourself,
now, can you?

56:43.442 --> 56:47.163
I just got back the results of that
literacy test you took, that reading test.

56:48.739 --> 56:50.116
You should be in the third grade.

56:51.408 --> 56:52.910
All right. Yay.

56:52.993 --> 56:54.791
Well, I got my own reading test for you.

56:55.245 --> 56:58.215
I want you to read the comic book
I'm gonna give you

56:58.206 --> 57:00.083
and write a report on it.

57:00.167 --> 57:01.635
- Shit.
- Oh, man.

57:02.085 --> 57:06.181
All right. I want you to write about
the characters and the storyline.

57:06.465 --> 57:08.467
All right? Keep it simple.

57:09.259 --> 57:10.431
What "line"?

57:10.510 --> 57:12.387
Spelling, punctuation, they count.

57:12.471 --> 57:15.350
Let's get started.
It's gotta be done this period.

57:15.349 --> 57:18.228
Sir, I don't think Lofgren can handle this.

57:18.310 --> 57:20.153
- It's a little too advanced for him.
- Shut up.

57:20.270 --> 57:21.362
All right.

57:21.813 --> 57:23.531
I'm not telling you again.

57:25.067 --> 57:26.319
He has a mouth.

57:28.362 --> 57:30.490
Well, let's go. Get to work.

57:37.663 --> 57:39.131
More, Jew boy.

57:44.878 --> 57:46.721
That's a good little kike.

57:53.804 --> 57:55.147
Hurry up.

57:57.724 --> 57:59.021
What?

58:00.227 --> 58:03.447
What? Armstrong? Armstrong? Armstrong?

58:03.438 --> 58:04.530
Can I have your spoon?

58:23.500 --> 58:24.752
Mighty Mouse.

58:28.630 --> 58:29.882
Horowitz!

58:50.902 --> 58:52.870
Get off me! Move!

58:53.947 --> 58:55.449
Get off me! Get out of the way!

58:55.949 --> 58:58.043
Don't put... Don't put me inside there, man!

58:58.118 --> 59:00.291
You can't put me in there! I hate solitary.

59:00.370 --> 59:03.123
Man, don't put me in there alone!
I hate being alone!

59:03.206 --> 59:06.335
Let me go. Let me go, you fucking asshole.
Let me go, man.

59:06.334 --> 59:08.712
Don't put me in solitary. Fuck you.

59:08.795 --> 59:10.797
Don't put me in solitary, man. Let me go.

59:10.881 --> 59:12.633
Let me go. Don't put me in there, man.

59:12.716 --> 59:14.389
That's it.

59:14.468 --> 59:17.312
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Don't do it! Get away from the door, man!

59:19.306 --> 59:21.308
Can't someone... Hey, let me out.

59:24.728 --> 59:29.484
You watch it, all right?
You can make all the noise you want now.

59:29.566 --> 59:32.570
Let me out of here, you fucking asshole.

59:32.652 --> 59:35.451
You can't keep me in here! Let me out!

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:20.434
Let's go.

01:03:14.874 --> 01:03:15.875
Man, are you crazy?

01:03:20.422 --> 01:03:21.423
Paco.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.085
Let's go.

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:01.425
Hey, man, she saw your face.

01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:03.214
I know.

01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:06.468
Paco.

01:04:09.596 --> 01:04:10.768
Do it.

01:04:24.569 --> 01:04:25.570
Do it.

01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:36.297
Hey. Get over here.

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:53.186
Hold it right there, buddy.

01:04:56.267 --> 01:04:58.486
We need your cooperation, J.C.

01:04:59.646 --> 01:05:02.820
I know what you're going through.
Believe me.

01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:07.328
But if you don't press charges,
this guy's gonna walk out of here.

01:05:08.363 --> 01:05:09.956
Don't let that animal get away with this.

01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:21.376
I wanna talk with Mick.

01:05:25.171 --> 01:05:26.514
I don't get this shit.

01:05:31.469 --> 01:05:34.439
Maybe you got some kind of
reading disability.

01:05:34.514 --> 01:05:37.563
- Like what?
- Like you can't read.

01:05:39.144 --> 01:05:40.191
O'Brien.

01:05:52.073 --> 01:05:53.074
Bye.

01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:05.340
She'll be all right.

01:06:12.594 --> 01:06:15.188
What's going on inside you right now?

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:17.898
What do you feel?

01:06:25.106 --> 01:06:26.858
I just feel like crying.

01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:29.281
That's okay.

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:32.071
CW-

01:06:33.531 --> 01:06:35.204
I've seen people cry before.

01:07:03.311 --> 01:07:07.612
You're number one, number two,
number three, number four, number five.

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:10.284
Remember your numbers. Lieutenant.

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:29.505
Okay, number one. Turn around. Face me.
What's your name?

01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:32.849
- Theodore Aparecia.
- Where do you live?

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:35.184
- 1872, South Racine.
- How old are you?

01:07:35.677 --> 01:07:37.554
- Seventeen.
- Turn around. Face the wall.

01:07:37.637 --> 01:07:40.186
Number two, turn around and face me.

01:07:40.265 --> 01:07:42.017
- What's your name?
- Richard DeLeon.

01:07:42.016 --> 01:07:44.735
- Where do you live?
- 2166, South Morgan.

01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:46.313
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

01:07:46.312 --> 01:07:48.314
Okay. Turn around and face the wall.

01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:50.658
Number three, turn around and face me.

01:07:51.442 --> 01:07:52.910
- What's your name?
- Paco Moreno.

01:07:53.319 --> 01:07:54.320
That's him.

01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:56.657
Never mind, miss. Hold on.
What's your address?

01:07:56.739 --> 01:07:59.162
- That's him.
- 2395, Grand Avenue.

01:07:59.158 --> 01:08:00.660
- How old are you?
- That's the one that raped me.

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:02.412
Okay, turn around and face the wall.

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:05.877
I'm sorry about J.C.

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:07.713
I really mean that.

01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:12.551
I gotta see her.

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.763
They're not gonna let you
out of here, O'Brien.

01:08:16.509 --> 01:08:18.182
Well, I'm not asking.

01:08:26.728 --> 01:08:28.024
You want some company?

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.997
That's one. Stay, stay, stay.

01:08:46.997 --> 01:08:49.216
- Throw it, dawg.
- Throw it, throw it.

01:08:49.207 --> 01:08:52.712
We go straight through, right here.
We'll make it.

01:08:54.505 --> 01:08:55.881
How do we get through this?

01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:58.680
Leave it to Beaver.

01:10:15.002 --> 01:10:16.845
I'm out of here next week.

01:10:16.921 --> 01:10:19.720
Let's hope I don't see you again,
'cause if I do...

01:10:19.799 --> 01:10:22.894
- I'll break your face all over again.
- We can start right now, chump.

01:10:22.969 --> 01:10:24.642
What's the problem?

01:10:26.431 --> 01:10:27.978
- No problem.
- No problem.

01:11:01.507 --> 01:11:02.804
Hey, Tweety.

01:11:08.181 --> 01:11:10.730
Yeah. Tweety!

01:11:10.808 --> 01:11:12.526
- Hey.
- What it is.

01:11:12.894 --> 01:11:14.066
Get him in here.

01:11:14.061 --> 01:11:15.984
- You're right.
- Come over here, brother.

01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:17.691
Yo, what's up, man?

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:19.363
Yeah. Come on. Let's go.

01:11:52.391 --> 01:11:54.234
Hey! Come on, let's go.

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:56.733
Keep moving. Let's go.

01:11:58.064 --> 01:12:00.237
- What's the matter? You hurt?
- I twisted my ankle.

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:03.741
You're not hurt, Horowitz, come on.
Move on. Keep going.

01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:14.648
- All right, all right, let's go.
- Hey, watch deep right.

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:23.361
- Throw the ball.
- Get out of the way, man.

01:13:24.025 --> 01:13:25.493
Go, go, go, go!

01:13:28.029 --> 01:13:30.077
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:13:40.499 --> 01:13:41.500
Back of the line.

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:45.338
- Don't dance.
- All right, give it back, baby.

01:13:47.882 --> 01:13:49.850
Oh, man. Hey, wait. Now, get over here!

01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:51.310
Call signal six.

01:14:46.899 --> 01:14:48.572
Hey, get this shit off me!

01:14:50.444 --> 01:14:51.821
Oh, fuck!

01:14:54.281 --> 01:14:56.534
Wagner! Come on, man.
I hear them over here.

01:14:56.909 --> 01:14:57.910
Go.

01:14:58.661 --> 01:14:59.662
Go!

01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:06.927
Oh, shit.

01:15:10.006 --> 01:15:11.258
I can't get this off me.

01:15:11.549 --> 01:15:13.267
Stupid shit!

01:15:13.467 --> 01:15:15.094
Fuck you, pig.

01:15:15.553 --> 01:15:17.601
- Hey! Hey, hey!
- Wagner, man!

01:15:18.806 --> 01:15:21.104
Wagner! Wagner!

01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:26.314
Wait! Leave the kid alone, man!

01:15:26.772 --> 01:15:28.695
What's wrong with you?

01:15:28.774 --> 01:15:30.697
O'Brien is gone, man. You let him get away!

01:16:43.182 --> 01:16:44.229
Mick.

01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:50.238
No.

01:17:20.427 --> 01:17:22.475
One minute, one minute.

01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:33.236
O'Brien.

01:17:37.570 --> 01:17:38.617
Let's go, man.

01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:57.719
Come on, come on, come on.

01:18:31.582 --> 01:18:33.425
Open up, 407!

01:18:41.133 --> 01:18:43.306
Open up, 222!

01:18:53.145 --> 01:18:55.147
Open up, 217!

01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:07.164
This is it, man. The bigs.

01:19:07.952 --> 01:19:09.420
Major league.

01:19:10.621 --> 01:19:11.964
Nice, huh?

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.212
Fuck up again,

01:19:15.042 --> 01:19:17.511
this is where you're gonna end up.

01:19:18.462 --> 01:19:21.466
Like I said, life's a choice, right?

01:19:23.384 --> 01:19:24.931
It's up to you.

01:19:36.855 --> 01:19:38.983
Open up, 344!

01:19:43.112 --> 01:19:47.458
Under ordinary circumstances, O'Brien,
I'd add six months to your time.

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:51.999
But just this once,

01:19:53.998 --> 01:19:55.295
I'm gonna give you another chance.

01:19:56.750 --> 01:20:00.050
Consider yourself lucky. Frank!

01:20:04.341 --> 01:20:08.391
Just remember, you're supposed to be
some kind of an example here.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:11.432
Don't make a fool out of me, O'Brien.

01:20:36.457 --> 01:20:37.674
You look terrible.

01:20:39.084 --> 01:20:41.337
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:20:44.214 --> 01:20:45.511
Did you see J.C.?

01:20:48.677 --> 01:20:49.769
Yeah.

01:20:54.183 --> 01:20:56.561
John, take this. Get that.

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:16.504
Yo, O'Brien!

01:21:18.082 --> 01:21:19.834
I gotta talk to you.

01:21:36.975 --> 01:21:38.727
Okay, here it comes.

01:21:41.855 --> 01:21:43.198
Paco Moreno is here.

01:21:43.899 --> 01:21:47.654
He's being processed right now
and he'll be coming into C-block.

01:21:47.653 --> 01:21:50.327
I don't have to tell you,
we're not exactly thrilled about this,

01:21:50.322 --> 01:21:54.168
but we had a logjam in admissions,
and that's the way it is.

01:21:55.202 --> 01:21:59.002
Now, I suggest you stay cool.

01:21:59.331 --> 01:22:03.427
Because if you fuck up,
the only person you'll be fucking up is you.

01:22:04.378 --> 01:22:06.881
You've got six months to go before review.

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:09.383
Do your time clean and you walk.

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:13.725
Any trouble,
and you could grow old in here, Jack.

01:22:16.557 --> 01:22:18.935
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:20.860
I can't hear you.

01:22:21.353 --> 01:22:22.605
Yes, Sir.

01:22:47.504 --> 01:22:48.881
Your bad!

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:30.514
This facility runs on a point system.

01:23:31.089 --> 01:23:32.432
Points are time.

01:23:33.175 --> 01:23:36.770
You get points for doing good
and points for screwing up.

01:23:37.471 --> 01:23:39.269
Doing good is no trouble.

01:23:39.264 --> 01:23:41.232
Coping a positive attitude.

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:46.314
While screwing up is fighting,
running for the fence,

01:23:46.313 --> 01:23:48.111
and coping a shit attitude,

01:23:48.106 --> 01:23:51.201
just like you're doing right now,
for instance.

01:23:58.659 --> 01:24:02.630
Moreno, we know all about you and O'Brien.

01:24:02.996 --> 01:24:04.088
Really?

01:24:07.793 --> 01:24:10.342
And I just don't want any shit from you.

01:24:10.462 --> 01:24:13.887
I want that dorm to stay nice and quiet.

01:24:15.133 --> 01:24:17.010
What makes you think
I'm gonna give you any trouble?

01:24:17.094 --> 01:24:19.847
Hey, man, the only reason you're here

01:24:19.846 --> 01:24:22.770
is because there's no room for you
any place else.

01:24:23.183 --> 01:24:25.481
Well, then why don't you get me a room
at the Holiday Inn?

01:24:25.769 --> 01:24:27.646
Why don't you wise up?

01:24:30.482 --> 01:24:33.076
Do you know what goes on inside here?

01:24:35.612 --> 01:24:37.285
Time stands still.

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:43.044
Outside, everybody else goes on
with their lives.

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:47.546
Working, making money, getting laid,
all that good shit.

01:24:47.541 --> 01:24:49.384
But in here, time just stops dead.

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:53.764
Look at your bad self, man.

01:24:56.258 --> 01:24:59.353
I was into that gang shit for half my life.

01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:02.393
It's dumb-fucking-nowhere shit!

01:25:04.141 --> 01:25:06.644
Hey, in here, everybody's the same.

01:25:08.353 --> 01:25:10.196
And I mean everybody.

01:25:11.398 --> 01:25:16.529
So, until we get you transferred,
I expect you to make good time.

01:25:17.195 --> 01:25:18.492
That's right, that's right.

01:25:18.864 --> 01:25:21.743
We gonna have your ass shipped down state

01:25:21.742 --> 01:25:24.962
as soon as there's an opening
in another facility.

01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:27.998
That could take a week, or a month,

01:25:29.207 --> 01:25:31.050
or maybe even a year.

01:25:32.085 --> 01:25:33.712
But until you go,

01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:36.223
you're gonna be real cool.

01:25:37.257 --> 01:25:38.634
You got it?

01:25:41.637 --> 01:25:43.014
Well, well.

01:25:44.056 --> 01:25:45.273
O'Brien,

01:25:46.183 --> 01:25:47.309
how's it going?

01:25:51.313 --> 01:25:53.862
I hear you're king shit in this place.

01:25:54.608 --> 01:25:57.407
Congratulations. If there's anything
I can do to help,

01:25:57.694 --> 01:25:59.116
please, let me know.

01:25:59.196 --> 01:26:01.790
I'm sorry about your little brother,
Moreno. Okay?

01:26:02.407 --> 01:26:04.910
You really break my heart. You know that?

01:26:07.079 --> 01:26:09.298
I'm sorry about your old lady.

01:26:10.916 --> 01:26:13.715
I'm sorry I didn't get to finish the job.

01:26:18.423 --> 01:26:20.391
Stay off my ass, Moreno.

01:26:21.093 --> 01:26:23.642
'Cause I got six months before my review,

01:26:23.637 --> 01:26:26.186
and I wanna make good time. You got that?

01:26:26.848 --> 01:26:30.819
Yeah, well, let me tell you something,
maricón. You're already dead.

01:26:30.894 --> 01:26:32.441
Only you don't know it

01:26:32.521 --> 01:26:35.866
because you're just as fucking stupid
as you ever was.

01:26:35.941 --> 01:26:38.785
Yeah. I killed your little brother, Moreno.

01:26:39.361 --> 01:26:43.411
But you just remember, he's dead
because you weren't looking out for him.

01:26:53.125 --> 01:26:55.002
All you guys up there, pay attention!

01:26:55.961 --> 01:26:59.932
Burns, Richards, Ocampo, K.P.!

01:27:02.342 --> 01:27:05.016
Hey, we've got a theater, man!

01:27:05.095 --> 01:27:11.819
Johnson, Roberts,
Perretti, Lee, Horowitz, agriculture!

01:27:14.604 --> 01:27:16.072
All right, quiet down!

01:27:17.816 --> 01:27:18.908
Moreno,

01:27:19.735 --> 01:27:20.827
shithouse.

01:27:27.826 --> 01:27:29.624
You like it, pretty?

01:27:37.586 --> 01:27:43.684
Lassandro, Tolson,
Gonzalez, Jones, Lopez, commons.

01:27:43.675 --> 01:27:46.849
Lopez, get a mop and start with this.

01:27:48.305 --> 01:27:49.352
Man!

01:27:49.931 --> 01:27:51.023
Thompson...

01:27:52.434 --> 01:27:54.937
Hey! You gonna keep that all day?

01:28:00.692 --> 01:28:03.036
- Who's it gonna be?
- The new guy.

01:28:05.906 --> 01:28:07.283
Five bucks.

01:28:16.374 --> 01:28:17.546
Make that

01:28:19.711 --> 01:28:21.008
two times.

01:28:31.807 --> 01:28:34.526
- He's gonna smash that white dude.
- Yeah.

01:28:36.228 --> 01:28:38.731
I hear O'Brien messed up your face.

01:28:42.567 --> 01:28:45.320
You know, it's too bad.

01:28:48.406 --> 01:28:49.749
And he killed your brother.

01:28:51.618 --> 01:28:53.370
Yeah, that's right.

01:28:54.663 --> 01:28:56.665
But he didn't kill me.

01:28:56.748 --> 01:28:59.171
He's not getting out of here alive.

01:28:59.251 --> 01:29:01.595
You forget it, Moreno. He's mine.

01:29:01.586 --> 01:29:02.712
Yeah?

01:29:03.839 --> 01:29:04.931
Yeah.

01:29:22.607 --> 01:29:25.451
This is nice. It's real nice.

01:29:29.072 --> 01:29:31.951
But it looks like me and you got a problem.

01:29:33.410 --> 01:29:36.630
You know,
they're betting on who's gonna kill who.

01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:40.508
Moreno's the odds-on favorite.

01:29:41.167 --> 01:29:44.171
Perretti and the chink
are running the action.

01:29:44.421 --> 01:29:45.468
Who you betting on?

01:29:46.256 --> 01:29:47.303
You.

01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:51.637
So, what are you gonna do about this cunt?

01:29:55.682 --> 01:29:56.934
Nothing.

01:29:57.726 --> 01:30:00.024
I wanna get the fuck out of this place.

01:30:00.103 --> 01:30:01.650
Yeah, but he's gonna kill you.

01:30:01.646 --> 01:30:03.444
That's what he says.

01:30:04.983 --> 01:30:06.656
- Gentlemen.
- Yo!

01:30:07.861 --> 01:30:10.614
You've all been graded
on those latest reports.

01:30:12.699 --> 01:30:17.546
And I'm happy to tell you,
finally, you all passed.

01:30:19.956 --> 01:30:21.583
I knew I was good.

01:30:24.836 --> 01:30:27.339
And there's a real artist in this class.

01:30:28.965 --> 01:30:31.263
Somebody with special talent.

01:30:31.343 --> 01:30:34.347
I didn't even know about it myself
until this report.

01:30:35.055 --> 01:30:38.525
But first, for the record, let me give you
my definition of what art is.

01:30:39.643 --> 01:30:44.023
Now, art is the creation
of something beautiful from nothing.

01:30:44.689 --> 01:30:46.236
- You know?
- That's me.

01:30:46.232 --> 01:30:51.580
And Lofgren has added a very special page
to his footnote

01:30:51.571 --> 01:30:53.539
to his report. Stand up, man.

01:30:53.531 --> 01:30:55.204
I think this is beautiful.
I wanna share with the group.

01:31:02.374 --> 01:31:04.126
- Faggot.
- Didn't know you had it in you.

01:31:05.418 --> 01:31:08.262
Cool it! Cool it, I said!

01:31:11.466 --> 01:31:13.218
Hey, Horowitz, stand up, man.

01:31:15.053 --> 01:31:16.225
You read this to the class.

01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:22.523
"Youth killed in robbery attempt.

01:31:23.019 --> 01:31:25.772
"A youth died Saturday
from gunshot wounds

01:31:25.772 --> 01:31:29.242
"received in an attempted holdup
of a liquor store.

01:31:29.234 --> 01:31:33.614
"Police said Warren Jerome of Chicago
was shot twice in the abdomen

01:31:33.613 --> 01:31:37.914
"by the proprietor of the High Jay
liquor store on Kimball Avenue,

01:31:37.909 --> 01:31:40.788
"after brandishing a pistol
and demanding money.

01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:45.250
"Jerome died undergoing surgery
at Our Lady Queen of Martyrs Hospital."

01:31:47.502 --> 01:31:48.970
So what?

01:31:49.045 --> 01:31:51.093
So what? Who the fuck is Warren Jerome?

01:31:51.089 --> 01:31:52.432
Who the fuck cares?

01:31:52.507 --> 01:31:54.134
Really. Who the fuck cares?

01:31:54.384 --> 01:31:55.431
Shut up!

01:32:00.015 --> 01:32:02.814
Yeah, Viking, tell them
who Warren Jerome was.

01:32:05.395 --> 01:32:07.614
That was Tweety, you assholes.

01:32:15.947 --> 01:32:19.292
Hey, what are the odds on me now, Perretti?

01:32:19.993 --> 01:32:24.123
Three-to-two, against you.

01:32:25.331 --> 01:32:26.378
Nothing personal.

01:32:54.819 --> 01:32:58.414
Hey! Clean it up!

01:33:00.617 --> 01:33:01.743
Fuck you, O'Brien.

01:33:02.202 --> 01:33:04.671
Yeah, fuck you. You clean it up.

01:33:05.497 --> 01:33:06.623
- Hey!
- No violence!

01:33:07.123 --> 01:33:10.172
Hey! You wanna play? You wanna play?

01:33:11.002 --> 01:33:12.379
Clean it up!

01:33:13.129 --> 01:33:14.847
Give your partner a hand, man.

01:33:14.923 --> 01:33:17.176
Horowitz started this shit.
Come on, who started this shit?

01:33:17.258 --> 01:33:18.976
I got $5 on Moreno.

01:33:26.684 --> 01:33:28.402
Horowitz, you forgot something, man.

01:33:28.478 --> 01:33:31.482
Yeah, yeah, Lofgren,
you show us your weenie later.

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:41.032
- How's it going?
- It's going.

01:33:42.408 --> 01:33:44.877
Any word yet on the Paco Moreno transfer?

01:33:45.703 --> 01:33:47.080
I haven't heard yet.

01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:48.457
NO, huh?

01:33:49.999 --> 01:33:52.422
'Cause this thing's
ready to blow any minute.

01:33:53.878 --> 01:33:55.004
I can feel it.

01:33:57.132 --> 01:33:58.759
I'll see what I can do.

01:34:00.677 --> 01:34:03.681
In the meantime,
you just have to keep an eye on 'em.

01:34:08.601 --> 01:34:10.569
You know what I do to squealers?

01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:13.732
I let them have it in the belly,

01:34:15.233 --> 01:34:19.659
so they can roll around for a long time,
thinking it oven

01:34:21.406 --> 01:34:23.500
- Tell Lipschitz.
- All right.

01:34:26.619 --> 01:34:27.916
Lipschitz.

01:34:31.916 --> 01:34:33.293
Hey, Lipschitz.

01:34:38.089 --> 01:34:40.888
Name's Horowitz, asshole.

01:34:42.135 --> 01:34:43.478
Horowitz Asshole?

01:34:48.766 --> 01:34:50.689
I heard it was Lipschitz.

01:34:50.768 --> 01:34:53.612
Yeah. And if your lip shits,
what's your asshole gonna do?

01:34:58.401 --> 01:35:02.031
That's really brilliant.
Just keep it up, assholes.

01:35:02.113 --> 01:35:05.208
Oh, yeah? And what are
you gonna do about it, huh?

01:35:06.659 --> 01:35:08.832
- Hey, that's enough, Moreno.
- Oh, yeah, is it?

01:35:08.912 --> 01:35:10.004
Yeah, it is.

01:35:10.079 --> 01:35:11.672
Yeah. Well, eat shit and die, O'Brien!

01:35:13.208 --> 01:35:14.801
- Hey, man.
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:35:14.876 --> 01:35:16.378
Let's get a smoke.

01:35:27.472 --> 01:35:30.817
You better smoke, you little...
It's bad for your health.

01:35:46.616 --> 01:35:47.993
Hey, don't fall!

01:35:54.082 --> 01:35:56.505
It's time you put that piece of garbage away.

01:35:59.128 --> 01:36:01.005
He's gonna do it to you.

01:36:04.175 --> 01:36:06.177
You can't do it, can you?

01:36:11.516 --> 01:36:13.644
Then I'm gonna get those fuckers.

01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:16.529
Five minutes, lights out!

01:36:17.647 --> 01:36:18.990
Yeah.

01:36:19.232 --> 01:36:20.859
Lights out!

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:24.445
Here comes the rain, man.

01:37:02.650 --> 01:37:03.867
Listen.

01:37:05.528 --> 01:37:08.077
After you do O'Brien,
what do you say, 50-50 split

01:37:08.072 --> 01:37:11.076
and two cartons a week, huh?

01:37:22.337 --> 01:37:23.714
I'll think about it.

01:37:44.609 --> 01:37:45.701
Hold this.

01:37:48.571 --> 01:37:50.323
Okay, now don't move.

01:37:56.704 --> 01:37:57.796
All right, let go.

01:38:11.219 --> 01:38:13.688
Shit. Man, I almost had it.

01:38:14.305 --> 01:38:15.397
What are you doing?

01:38:16.766 --> 01:38:18.564
What the fuck's eating you?

01:38:51.509 --> 01:38:52.806
Hey, what's up?

01:38:53.553 --> 01:38:56.682
Yeah, we gotta shake 'em down.
Take Moreno, I'll take O'Brien.

01:38:57.682 --> 01:39:00.026
O'Brien, looks like your time.

01:39:09.026 --> 01:39:10.152
It's a bust.

01:39:28.129 --> 01:39:29.301
Hurry up, Horowitz.

01:39:41.934 --> 01:39:43.026
Here he comes.

01:39:43.644 --> 01:39:47.774
O'Brien, Horowitz, let's go now!
Out, out, out, out!

01:39:48.941 --> 01:39:51.364
Legs, spread them.

01:40:03.498 --> 01:40:04.841
Spread them.

01:40:12.173 --> 01:40:13.766
Stay over there.

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:17.728
Tell them you know your rights.

01:40:43.454 --> 01:40:44.580
Boys?

01:41:01.472 --> 01:41:04.692
I'm going to get you, Horowitz.

01:41:05.935 --> 01:41:08.029
I'm not happy about this, Lofgren.

01:41:08.104 --> 01:41:09.321
Yes, Sir.

01:41:11.315 --> 01:41:13.158
In fact, I'm very pissed off.

01:41:14.318 --> 01:41:16.161
I'm very pissed off!

01:41:18.197 --> 01:41:23.044
This is an extremely serious offense,
and we are going to take disciplinary action.

01:41:23.119 --> 01:41:27.044
The only thing in your favor
is you admitted possession of this weapon.

01:41:28.082 --> 01:41:31.837
I'm gonna give you a choice.
Four weeks in solitary confinement

01:41:33.921 --> 01:41:35.923
or four months added to your time.

01:41:40.678 --> 01:41:43.397
I'll take... I'll take the four months, sir.

01:42:02.033 --> 01:42:03.876
Hey, hey. Flush the toilet.

01:42:28.601 --> 01:42:29.898
Not bad.

01:42:31.354 --> 01:42:33.152
It's even better than the knife.

01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:37.739
Really? Forget it.

01:42:38.569 --> 01:42:40.992
I told you, that cocksucker's mine.
I'm gonna take him out.

01:42:41.364 --> 01:42:43.082
Now, wait a minute.

01:42:44.575 --> 01:42:45.952
I lost my brother.

01:42:48.245 --> 01:42:50.339
All you lost was some skin.

01:43:33.541 --> 01:43:35.043
Hey, Robert.

01:43:37.962 --> 01:43:39.839
You guys know where this came from?

01:43:40.798 --> 01:43:42.175
- No.
- Sure?

01:43:42.717 --> 01:43:43.843
Yes.

01:43:44.343 --> 01:43:45.811
Very nice radio.

01:43:47.263 --> 01:43:48.981
Yeah, it's mine now.

01:44:41.275 --> 01:44:42.697
Somebody get somebody.

01:44:44.862 --> 01:44:46.114
Somebody get somebody, man.

01:44:46.197 --> 01:44:47.824
Please, please. Come on, guys.

01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:52.124
We identified the material
you used to make that charge.

01:44:53.370 --> 01:44:56.544
Nitrogen from fertilizer. Very clever.

01:44:58.584 --> 01:45:00.336
You're lucky Lofgren didn't die.

01:45:01.629 --> 01:45:04.883
One question, Barry.
Did O'Brien know anything about this?

01:45:05.382 --> 01:45:08.511
No. I did it all myself.

01:45:09.804 --> 01:45:10.930
All right.

01:45:11.764 --> 01:45:13.937
You'll serve the remainder of
your time in this program

01:45:13.933 --> 01:45:15.901
in solitary confinement, starting now.

01:45:15.893 --> 01:45:17.236
Hey, no way, man.

01:45:17.228 --> 01:45:18.901
- I'm not going to solitary.
- Barry.

01:45:19.230 --> 01:45:21.232
- Fuck you! I'm not going.
- Watch your mouth.

01:45:21.315 --> 01:45:23.488
- Fuck you, man!
- Put it down, Barry.

01:45:24.985 --> 01:45:26.783
Churchill! Churchill!

01:45:26.904 --> 01:45:29.532
Get in here. Barry, stop it!

01:45:29.782 --> 01:45:31.580
- Come on, man!
- Barry, give up.

01:45:31.742 --> 01:45:34.291
Fuck you! Kill me first, you understand?

01:45:34.286 --> 01:45:35.458
Barry, for God's sake, use your head.

01:45:35.538 --> 01:45:38.166
- Get him!
- You'll have to kill me first!

01:45:38.999 --> 01:45:41.627
- Come on! Come on!
- Get him! Get him!

01:45:41.710 --> 01:45:42.927
- Come on, fuckers!
- Barry...

01:45:44.755 --> 01:45:46.428
- Get him down.
- Fuck you...

01:45:47.299 --> 01:45:49.097
Get him up! Barry!

01:45:49.093 --> 01:45:51.437
Barry, you're just adding to your time.

01:45:51.428 --> 01:45:53.146
Fuck all you cunts!

01:46:29.884 --> 01:46:32.057
Oh, Ray, I was just looking for you.

01:46:32.469 --> 01:46:34.972
The Moreno transfer just came through.

01:46:34.972 --> 01:46:36.974
We're sending him off to Winfield tomorrow.

01:46:37.975 --> 01:46:39.852
- Thank God.
- Amen.

01:46:41.562 --> 01:46:42.779
Perretti.

01:46:47.902 --> 01:46:48.994
Moreno.

01:46:50.321 --> 01:46:52.870
Your transfer just got here.

01:46:52.865 --> 01:46:55.914
You're going to Winfield tomorrow.

01:47:15.346 --> 01:47:16.689
How're you doing?

01:47:19.475 --> 01:47:20.727
Hey, O'Brien.

01:47:22.436 --> 01:47:25.064
I just heard your buddy Paco is leaving.

01:47:25.147 --> 01:47:26.615
How about that?

01:47:26.690 --> 01:47:27.862
What are you talking about?

01:47:27.942 --> 01:47:31.742
Moreno's being transferred
first thing tomorrow morning.

01:47:33.614 --> 01:47:34.957
You got lucky.

01:47:37.576 --> 01:47:39.999
Five minutes, lights out!

01:47:40.955 --> 01:47:42.457
Let's go!

01:47:49.213 --> 01:47:50.635
- Hey, Briggs.
- Hurry up, hurry up.

01:47:51.548 --> 01:47:54.176
Put out that cigarette
and get your ass in bed.

01:47:54.635 --> 01:47:55.852
Yeah, yeah.

01:47:59.139 --> 01:48:02.860
Gentlemen, here comes the night.

01:50:01.929 --> 01:50:05.058
I think my appendix broke. Help me.

01:50:07.142 --> 01:50:08.940
- What happened?
- My...

01:50:09.353 --> 01:50:10.775

- My appendix.

01:50:10.854 --> 01:50:12.197
Let me. ..

01:52:12.726 --> 01:52:15.195
Hey. Hey!

01:52:17.314 --> 01:52:19.191
Hold it, you guys.

01:52:20.692 --> 01:52:22.820
- What's happening, man?
- What's going on?

01:52:22.819 --> 01:52:24.036
Hey!

01:52:24.029 --> 01:52:25.827
Hey, it's going down, man. It's going down.

01:52:25.948 --> 01:52:27.040
Hey, you guys!

01:52:28.033 --> 01:52:29.535
- Hold it!

01:52:31.161 --> 01:52:33.163
Come on, you fucking guys.

01:52:33.330 --> 01:52:34.502
Hold on!

01:52:35.123 --> 01:52:37.967
- Paco!
- Don't be crazy. Come on, man!

01:52:39.503 --> 01:52:42.347
Moreno! O'Brien! No!

01:53:00.190 --> 01:53:01.442
Come on, man!

01:53:04.778 --> 01:53:06.451
Come on, man, you can take him.

01:53:41.148 --> 01:53:42.900
Come on!

01:53:51.742 --> 01:53:53.210
Get him, get him!

01:54:29.780 --> 01:54:30.781
Let's go.

01:54:59.684 --> 01:55:00.981
Come on, O'Brien!

01:55:05.649 --> 01:55:07.071
Yeah, that's it!

01:55:11.029 --> 01:55:12.451
Come on!

01:55:59.536 --> 01:56:05.885
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

01:56:06.710 --> 01:56:11.887
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

01:59:29.287 --> 01:59:32.541
In the rooms. Let's go. In the rooms.

01:59:37.212 --> 01:59:38.589
Lights off!

01:59:51.685 --> 01:59:52.686
Lights off!

01:59:57.232 --> 01:59:58.700
Hey, close that door.

01:59:59.901 --> 02:00:01.198
Let's close up there.
