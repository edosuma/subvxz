01:15.459 --> 01:16.625
Okay.

01:19.163 --> 01:20.429
Hey, Candace.

01:21.932 --> 01:23.332
Did you just wake up?

01:23.434 --> 01:25.768
It's 1:00 p.m.. I've been
up since 4:00, working.

01:25.870 --> 01:27.703
You haven't brushed
your hair yet?

01:27.805 --> 01:29.271
Your muskrat
is better groomed.

01:29.373 --> 01:30.506
Jenny is a bunny!

01:33.344 --> 01:35.744
Are you here to help?

01:35.846 --> 01:37.946
Nope, looking for the van keys.
Here they are.

01:39.850 --> 01:42.351
Daddy said I could buy my own
Christmas presents this year.

01:42.453 --> 01:45.354
Great. Would you be able to drop
these off at the Rizchecks for me?

01:45.456 --> 01:47.890
Those look
really fragile.

01:47.992 --> 01:51.627
I might drop something, and then you'd
have to redo all this work all over again.

01:51.729 --> 01:53.762
Can't argue
with that logic.

01:53.864 --> 01:56.632
You know, I would feel bad for you if you
didn't just make more work for yourself.

01:56.734 --> 01:59.234
You agonize over these
sentimental details

01:59.336 --> 02:02.070
like glassware from the year
so-and-so was born

02:02.139 --> 02:04.706
and does anyone
even notice?

02:04.809 --> 02:09.311
As event planners, it's our job
to create a magical experience.

02:09.413 --> 02:12.247
Anything that helps with
that magic is worth it.

02:12.349 --> 02:14.983
Well, it will be worth it
if a rich bachelor notices me.

02:15.085 --> 02:17.553
So don't forget
to forward me that guest list.

02:17.655 --> 02:19.388
Later, cuz.

02:19.490 --> 02:22.224
Hey, what's my dad doing
for your present this year?

02:24.428 --> 02:26.695
He told me to think about it
and to let him know.

02:28.866 --> 02:30.732
I'm going to tell him I want
the event planning business.

02:30.835 --> 02:32.668
Really?

02:32.770 --> 02:36.171
He's been hinting at retirement and
I'm going to offer to buy him out.

02:36.273 --> 02:37.639
You can afford to do that?

02:37.741 --> 02:41.777
I have savings and the
money my parents left me.

02:41.879 --> 02:46.248
I'm going to ask him tomorrow night
at dinner, so I was hoping that...

02:46.350 --> 02:47.616
you tell him
you support it.

02:48.919 --> 02:51.253
Sure.
No problem, cuz.

02:53.858 --> 02:55.657
So how'd she take it?

02:55.759 --> 02:58.360
Candace isn't exactly one to be swayed
by a quote from Emily Dickinson.

02:58.462 --> 03:01.129
We've moved on
to Oscar Wilde quotes now.

03:02.266 --> 03:04.333
Surprisingly she took it well.

03:04.435 --> 03:06.268
I just hope I didn't
hurt her feelings.

03:06.370 --> 03:09.171
Okay, you are
way too nice.

03:09.273 --> 03:12.274
What if she doesn't support you
tomorrow? Do you know what you'll say?

03:13.577 --> 03:15.544
Yeah.

03:15.646 --> 03:17.312
I'm hoping it won't
come to that.

03:17.414 --> 03:18.647
Okay, let's hear it.

03:19.917 --> 03:22.050
Okay. Uncle Otto...

03:22.119 --> 03:25.487
I'm forever grateful for you
taking me in when my parents died

03:25.589 --> 03:27.689
and treating me like
your own daughter.

03:27.791 --> 03:31.226
And I know how happy it made you when
Candace and I were working together.

03:31.328 --> 03:34.763
So when she took all the credit
for my work, I let her.

03:34.832 --> 03:38.000
When she stopped coming
to work, I took over.

03:38.102 --> 03:42.471
And I changed your catering company into
a respected events planning business.

03:42.573 --> 03:46.074
I work day and night to make
that company a success.

03:46.176 --> 03:50.412
And I would love the opportunity
to run this business alone.

03:50.514 --> 03:52.147
That is what I want
for Christmas.

03:53.450 --> 03:54.917
It's my passion.

03:55.019 --> 03:56.852
That's so nice.

03:56.954 --> 03:59.054
You're a better
person than me.

03:59.156 --> 04:02.858
See, I would give some examples of specific
injustices Candace has inflicted upon you.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.093
Or on the positive side,

04:05.195 --> 04:08.730
you can tell him how the Christ-Masquerade
Ball is breaking the Internet.

04:08.832 --> 04:12.267
Everyone's trying to get an invitation to
something that exists solely because of you.

04:12.369 --> 04:14.903
Well, I'm just hoping
nothing has to be said.

04:15.005 --> 04:18.173
I wouldn't be too sure. Candace
always has something up her sleeve.

04:27.184 --> 04:29.618
Someone else's
leftovers again?

04:32.356 --> 04:35.157
Are you okay, Uncle Otto?
You look really tired.

04:36.694 --> 04:37.993
Bingo!

04:39.029 --> 04:41.196
Sit down, love.

04:41.298 --> 04:44.599
I couldn't be prouder of what you girls
have done with my catering business.

04:44.702 --> 04:46.435
Thanks, Daddy.

04:46.537 --> 04:48.870
You know, I've been running small
businesses since I was a young man.

04:48.973 --> 04:51.873
You girls now know first hand
how much hard work that is.

04:51.976 --> 04:54.543
You're hitting your stride just as
I'm getting ready to take it easy.

04:54.645 --> 05:00.382
So... I've decided I'm going to
retire at the end of this year.

05:00.484 --> 05:03.752
Congratulations.

05:03.854 --> 05:07.422
Actually, I was wanting to discuss the
event planning business with you.

05:07.524 --> 05:09.391
Candace and I
discussed it already.

05:09.493 --> 05:11.059
She convinced me that
you girls can handle it.

05:11.161 --> 05:12.995
Candace has convinced you...

05:13.097 --> 05:16.498
I will sell everything except my three
oldest, most stable small businesses,

05:16.567 --> 05:19.334
and the newest one,
the event planning.

05:19.436 --> 05:24.906
The same way you run them together now,
you can run them together forever.

05:25.009 --> 05:27.275
This is my Christmas
gift to you both.

05:27.378 --> 05:30.012
I still get to keep the presents that I
already bought for myself though, right?

05:30.114 --> 05:32.514
Of course, Pumpkin.

05:32.616 --> 05:34.316
Okay.

05:34.418 --> 05:37.586
Uncle Otto, that is very generous
of you and I am so grateful...

05:37.688 --> 05:39.688
I know, it's all so much.

05:39.790 --> 05:42.024
The two of us working
together forever.

05:42.126 --> 05:44.826
Daddy's so excited.

05:44.928 --> 05:47.896
Let's get some Christmas cookies
and discuss our future.

05:56.707 --> 05:58.106
What's your problem?

05:58.208 --> 06:00.509
You wanted to own one
business, now you own four.

06:00.611 --> 06:02.778
You didn't even have
to make a big pitch.

06:02.880 --> 06:06.448
I wanted to own one by myself,
and I was willing to pay for it.

06:06.550 --> 06:09.684
I know. I was thinking about what
you said about buying my dad out.

06:09.787 --> 06:10.852
Clearly.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.287
And I would prefer
for you to buy me out.

06:13.657 --> 06:15.524
You want me to give you
my parent's money?

06:15.626 --> 06:17.959
No, I want you
to work it off.

06:19.096 --> 06:21.363
-What do you mean?
-You work for me.

06:21.465 --> 06:25.000
Anytime, day or night, anything and
everything I need. No excuses.

06:26.737 --> 06:27.736
For how long?

06:27.838 --> 06:29.004
Until I get married.

06:29.106 --> 06:30.872
Which, if I meet
one of these rich bachelors

06:30.974 --> 06:32.974
at the Carmichael Ball
will be very soon.

06:35.412 --> 06:36.845
-Can I think about it?
-No.

06:38.148 --> 06:39.815
You could go out on your own,

06:39.917 --> 06:44.019
compete against me and
gravely upset my father...

06:44.121 --> 06:46.855
or you could just keep doing
what you've already been doing.

06:46.957 --> 06:49.424
And once I marry
my rich prince,

06:49.526 --> 06:52.494
I'll be out of your hair and
you get everything you want.

06:53.630 --> 06:54.796
What do you say?

06:56.133 --> 06:57.466
At your service.

07:01.955 --> 07:04.089
This is the kind
of place I should be living in.

07:04.191 --> 07:08.160
And will be, once I land the
man of Carmichael's caliber.

07:08.262 --> 07:10.996
Can't believe people think you have a knack
for this. These ornaments are hideous.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.865
Those are not ornaments. They're
hooks to hang stockings.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.934
Not for that stupid game
you were babbling about.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.103
Tell me you didn't send that
nonsense to Nicholas Carmichael.

07:18.205 --> 07:20.806
He's probably on his way here
right now to fire us.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.174
Am I
interrupting something?

07:22.276 --> 07:25.544
No... No, Mr. Carmichael.
Not at all.

07:25.646 --> 07:28.547
Well, shouldn't I be? I mean,
this party is only a day away.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.215
And please,
it's Nicholas.

07:30.317 --> 07:33.618
What my cousin means
is you could never interrupt.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.987
I should visit
my kitchen more often.

07:36.089 --> 07:38.890
You must be the one sending me the
sketches and ideas for the party.

07:38.992 --> 07:41.359
That depends on what
you thought of them.

07:41.462 --> 07:44.229
Well, I'm insane for
the Christ-Masquerade idea.

07:44.331 --> 07:47.632
The castle and the moat
design for the pool house.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.034
And that names
are forbidden.

07:50.437 --> 07:52.237
And this, 
Christmas stocking game...

07:53.273 --> 07:55.740
now that,
that is the real winner.

07:55.843 --> 08:00.245
Well, you seem like a man willing
to party outside of the box.

08:00.347 --> 08:01.680
You'll be there, won't you?

08:04.117 --> 08:05.817
As my guest?

08:06.920 --> 08:08.286
If you insist.

08:12.960 --> 08:17.128
I see my future and it is Mr.
Nicholas Carmichael himself.

08:18.198 --> 08:20.098
See, Angie?

08:20.200 --> 08:22.834
Your dreams could be realized
sooner than you think.

08:22.936 --> 08:26.238
And on that note, I have a ton of work
to do to get myself ready for the ball

08:26.340 --> 08:27.572
and I can't
do it alone.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.608
I have quite a bit of work
to do here, actually.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.210
Helping me
is helping you.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.280
What do you need?

08:36.383 --> 08:40.552
I'll need an infrared body wrap, facial, spray
tan, mani-pedi, eyelash extensions and tint.

08:40.654 --> 08:43.889
A full body wax, teeth whitening,
make-up and hair styling.

08:43.991 --> 08:47.225
And a one-of-a-kind dress, custom-made,
obviously. Don't forget the shoes.

08:47.327 --> 08:48.927
The stocking.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.630
I'm not getting a spray tan and
a pedicure so I can wear hose.

08:51.732 --> 08:54.132
Christmas stocking,
for the game.

08:54.234 --> 08:55.634
It's a requirement
for you to attend.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.435
Fine. And a stocking.

08:57.538 --> 09:00.972
You have to fill it with five
things that only have value to you.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.608
Okay, whatever,
you'll think of something.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.978
Make sure I don't lose this.
I'm off to get my beauty rest.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.662
Well, I never took you
for a tabloid fan.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.864
How else would I know
what's going on in your life?

09:26.867 --> 09:28.400
Thank you, darling.

09:28.502 --> 09:31.236
I never would've guessed
she wasn't marriage material.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.672
You met her at Mardi Gras,
pulled her onto a float, right?

09:33.774 --> 09:38.076
You know, I keep thinking that I finally
found a woman who truly enjoys my company.

09:38.178 --> 09:41.780
And then I learn that she's really
just after, well...

09:41.882 --> 09:44.549
Your company,
and yet, I'm the bad guy.

09:46.553 --> 09:48.687
Mother, did you have a chance
to read over my proposal?

09:48.789 --> 09:50.355
Yes.

09:50.457 --> 09:53.024
But when a man who spends
most of his time

09:53.126 --> 09:58.029
gallivanting writes a proposal on how
to attract more female employees,

09:58.131 --> 10:01.700
forgive me for wondering if he's not
just trying to widen his dating pool.

10:01.802 --> 10:07.339
Actually, my goal is to make my business and
personal life less connected, not more.

10:07.441 --> 10:10.208
Now, I know that you're not against
gender equality in the workplace,

10:10.310 --> 10:14.713
so you refusing my proposal could
only really mean one thing.

10:14.815 --> 10:17.349
Consider a marriage proposal and
I'll consider your work proposal.

10:18.919 --> 10:21.186
You're stonewalling my career
to make me get married.

10:21.288 --> 10:26.558
Nicholas, your father wanted your
life to have meaning and so do I.

10:26.660 --> 10:29.694
You have a huge fortune
at your fingertips

10:29.796 --> 10:32.998
that you refuse
to even attempt to claim.

10:33.100 --> 10:36.735
Most men fear marriage, I know your
father did. But they still do it.

10:36.837 --> 10:41.373
Most men don't have a trust account that
requires marriage to claim their inheritance.

10:41.475 --> 10:43.575
Most men don't have
an inheritance.

10:43.677 --> 10:45.877
I would be happy
with a paycheck

10:45.979 --> 10:48.213
and some respect
for the work I do.

10:48.315 --> 10:51.583
It's easier to respect someone
who's mature and stable.

10:51.685 --> 10:54.853
So it's mature and stable to get
married to someone that you don't love

10:54.955 --> 10:57.422
because you'll be punished
if you wait for the real thing!

10:57.524 --> 10:59.924
It cannot be
that hard, Nicholas.

11:00.027 --> 11:03.161
You know your soul-mate isn't
someone you've already dated.

11:03.263 --> 11:07.599
And that eliminates a huge percentage
of the population, darling.

11:08.635 --> 11:09.934
Have fun at your party.

11:14.608 --> 11:16.508
Hey, Candace.
It's me.

11:16.610 --> 11:19.778
You have your body wrap in 30 minutes
time and tanning at the same place.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.780
I'm going to drop your
dress off at the salon

11:21.882 --> 11:23.915
and you're going to get your
hair and nails and make-up done.

11:24.017 --> 11:27.318
The ball starts at 8:00 p.m.. Do not
be late and you need your stocking.

11:34.795 --> 11:37.762
Man, by the way you were running, I'm
guessing your mom nixed your proposal.

11:37.864 --> 11:40.432
It's time for a change, Max.

11:40.534 --> 11:42.434
Well, guests are going
to arrive in a couple of hours.

11:42.536 --> 11:44.469
I suggest you put on
your suit and mask.

11:44.571 --> 11:47.372
I'm not talking about my clothes. I'm
talking about these public breakups

11:47.474 --> 11:51.009
followed by an argument with my mother,
followed by punishment at work.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.479
I'm sick of this cycle.

11:54.581 --> 11:55.914
What am I doing wrong?

11:56.016 --> 11:58.249
Nick, I've known you since
we were teenagers, man.

11:58.351 --> 12:01.586
And you seem to date the same
woman over and over again.

12:01.688 --> 12:03.822
She looks different.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.925
Well, she's not, man. She's not. Do you even
know what you're looking for in a woman?

12:07.027 --> 12:09.994
I figured when I found her,
I'd just know.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.497
So why is she
so hard to find.

12:12.599 --> 12:15.734
Because you have this long
line of gorgeous women

12:15.836 --> 12:18.770
who throw themselves at you and tell you
what you want to hear, blocking your view.

12:18.839 --> 12:21.272
Which is fine by me, because as your
best friend and personal assistant,

12:21.374 --> 12:25.176
I do not mind being surrounded
by beautiful superficial women.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.612
But the woman
of your dreams...

12:27.714 --> 12:29.214
she may be a little
deeper in the crowd.

12:35.322 --> 12:39.190
There you are. Finally. I was
about to give up on you.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.559
-Are you Zelda?
-I am.

12:41.661 --> 12:43.528
And you're the woman who
called about the custom dress.

12:43.630 --> 12:46.564
Yes, that's right, and you have
a stocking and a mask to match?

12:46.666 --> 12:49.367
Yes, I was inspired
to design this dress

12:49.469 --> 12:51.436
as soon as I heard about
the Christ-Masquerade ball.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.571
What a brilliant idea
for the party.

12:53.673 --> 12:56.441
I put this dress aside for you. It's going
to go beautifully with your coloring.

12:58.712 --> 13:01.646
Well, it's not for me,

13:01.748 --> 13:04.783
but the person it's for has the same
coloring, so it's good, I guess.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.218
But I designed the dress
especially for you.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.788
I bet you say that
to all your customers.

13:09.890 --> 13:13.525
Not all. But when
I do, it's true.

13:15.061 --> 13:16.494
You don't know me.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.296
I've seen you
in the neighborhood.

13:18.398 --> 13:21.833
You go to that funny international
restaurant down the street.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.468
Yeah.

13:23.570 --> 13:26.237
And the cemetery.
Who do you visit there?

13:27.440 --> 13:28.606
My parents.

13:30.777 --> 13:31.943
You've really seen me?

13:33.847 --> 13:36.648
You struck me as a woman
who wears a mask.

13:36.750 --> 13:40.985
A mask that keeps you from seeing
how special you really are.

13:41.087 --> 13:43.621
I made you a mask and a
dress to do the opposite.

13:48.695 --> 13:51.462
I really hate to give
it away, but I have to.

13:51.565 --> 13:54.132
Well, I don't let a dress leave
here until it's been fitted.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.100
So you're going to have to
at least try it on.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.069
If you insist.

14:01.808 --> 14:02.941
I told you.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.477
It's like wearing magic.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.615
I've never worn anything
like this before.

14:12.719 --> 14:15.019
I look like a completely
different person.

14:15.121 --> 14:18.056
You look like the person
you are on the inside.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.024
You were meant
to wear this dress.

14:20.126 --> 14:21.559
Fits like a dream.

14:24.764 --> 14:27.298
I just hope it fits the person
that's meant to wear it.

14:28.802 --> 14:30.535
She can be...

14:30.637 --> 14:31.970
Difficult.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.404
To say the least.

14:35.408 --> 14:38.409
Thank you. Thank you
for being so kind to me.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.816
God, I really best
get going.

14:44.918 --> 14:47.518
Candace, your appointment
started half an hour ago.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.321
Your stylist stayed late
to fit you in.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.223
Those butchers you sent me to
ripped my skin off!

14:52.325 --> 14:53.858
What?

14:53.960 --> 14:56.261
What do you mean? -I had some
sort of allergic reaction

14:56.363 --> 14:58.997
to my diamond facial and I know
I'm not allergic to diamonds.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.765
So I don't know
what they were using.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.700
This is all your fault!

15:02.802 --> 15:05.103
What... No...
You gave me their number.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.205
You have had their peels
so many times before.

15:07.307 --> 15:10.008
Sure, put it back on me,
like you always do.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.410
Now I can't go
to the Christ-Masquerade ball.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.946
What? You can't go?

15:15.048 --> 15:17.949
No! My face is all red!

15:18.051 --> 15:19.417
You're going to be
wearing a mask.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.786
For my eyes,
not my whole face!

15:28.895 --> 15:31.729
I'm so sorry,
but she isn't coming.

15:31.831 --> 15:36.034
- You're here.
- No, I couldn't...

15:36.136 --> 15:37.869
And you did pay in advance.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.040
Oscar Wilde did say,
the only way

15:42.142 --> 15:44.142
to get rid of temptation
is to yield to it.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.311
Get in the chair.

16:17.510 --> 16:18.576
Hello?

16:18.678 --> 16:19.677
Where are you?

16:21.281 --> 16:23.781
-I'm driving.
-On your way home, I hope.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.185
No.

16:27.287 --> 16:28.920
Exactly what
I was afraid of.

16:29.022 --> 16:31.122
I just realized that it might
have crossed your mind

16:31.224 --> 16:33.758
to go to the Christ-Masquerade
ball yourself.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.593
-Well...
-I knew it!

16:35.695 --> 16:37.929
Don't even think about it, Angie,
he gave that invite to me!

16:38.031 --> 16:41.532
Yes, because he thought
you planned the ball.

16:41.634 --> 16:45.937
And I'm sure he actually meant to
give the invite to the company.

16:46.039 --> 16:48.473
Please. He didn't
really give me the invite

16:48.575 --> 16:50.875
because he liked my ideas.

16:50.977 --> 16:52.377
And if you go,
I'm liable to think

16:52.479 --> 16:55.546
that you staged this
whole facial mishap on purpose.

16:55.648 --> 16:58.216
And that will be very hard
for me to overlook.

17:00.286 --> 17:02.787
I'm sorry, Candace, I...

17:02.889 --> 17:04.454
I don't know what
I was thinking.

17:04.557 --> 17:07.058
You weren't, and don't act
like I'm being so unfair.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.027
If the invite really was
for the company

17:09.128 --> 17:11.796
that we still
share 50-50,

17:11.897 --> 17:13.830
that means we share it.

17:13.933 --> 17:16.134
So if I can't go,
you can't go!

17:16.236 --> 17:19.369
That's not how
sharing works.

17:19.472 --> 17:22.540
If I hear that you were seen at the ball
before leading clean up crew at midnight,

17:22.642 --> 17:26.344
I will be very upset.
Understood?

17:29.682 --> 17:31.349
You won't hear that
anyone saw me.

17:39.275 --> 17:41.442
Wait. Wait for me.

17:42.579 --> 17:43.678
Please.

17:44.714 --> 17:45.947
Hi.

17:46.049 --> 17:47.749
You have your invitation
and stocking?

17:47.851 --> 17:49.584
Yes, sir.

17:49.686 --> 17:51.018
Very good.

17:54.624 --> 17:56.190
Welcome.

18:35.799 --> 18:37.532
Nicholas always throws
great parties, but this...

18:37.634 --> 18:39.066
It's on
another level.

18:42.272 --> 18:44.005
This decor is stunning!

18:44.107 --> 18:47.542
I've got to get the name
of this planner.

18:52.849 --> 18:54.415
Attention, everyone!

18:56.119 --> 18:58.820
Welcome,
Christ-Masqueraders.

18:58.922 --> 19:01.489
Please make your way
to the tree of stockings

19:01.591 --> 19:04.325
and choose one that
is not your own.

19:04.427 --> 19:07.762
Each stocking contains five
items of no monetary value,

19:07.864 --> 19:10.031
but which have significance
to the owner.

19:10.133 --> 19:11.599
The point of
the game is to find

19:11.701 --> 19:14.235
the owner of the stocking
which you selected.

19:14.337 --> 19:16.904
Now should you meet someone
and find that the two of you

19:17.006 --> 19:18.539
have chosen
each other's stockings,

19:18.641 --> 19:20.608
well, we have a match!

19:20.710 --> 19:23.644
And the two of you will win a grand
prize to be announced at midnight.

19:24.647 --> 19:25.880
Let the game begin!

19:53.643 --> 19:55.176
Can I take this one?

20:39.889 --> 20:41.055
I chose you.

20:42.525 --> 20:44.258
How do you know
it was me?

20:44.360 --> 20:46.794
It's hard not to notice you
from across the room.

20:46.896 --> 20:49.797
And your stocking,
it matches your dress.

20:49.899 --> 20:51.465
Yes.

20:51.534 --> 20:53.734
I chose it because
it's clearly one of a kind.

20:55.471 --> 20:57.204
Yeah, that's why
I chose this one.

20:57.307 --> 20:59.840
Looks like it's seen
30 Christmases.

20:59.943 --> 21:01.575
I mean, obviously,
he really cherishes this.

21:01.644 --> 21:03.344
Indeed, he does.

21:03.446 --> 21:05.646
This is yours?

21:05.748 --> 21:08.149
Did we just
win the game?

21:08.251 --> 21:10.117
Well, I wonder what
our prize is?

21:10.219 --> 21:11.585
I think I'm looking at her.

21:14.924 --> 21:16.390
Would you dance with me?

21:19.162 --> 21:20.328
Yes.

22:26.029 --> 22:27.628
Will you come with me?

22:30.466 --> 22:32.266
These beef puffs
are amazing.

22:32.368 --> 22:34.568
Thank you.

22:34.670 --> 22:36.637
I mean, I know.

22:36.739 --> 22:38.606
This is my best party ever.

22:38.708 --> 22:41.275
This is the best party that I've ever
been to. Not like this is my party.

22:41.377 --> 22:43.978
Because that would make you
Nicholas Carmichael.

22:44.080 --> 22:47.014
And you're definitely
not him.

22:48.084 --> 22:49.083
Have you met him?

22:50.186 --> 22:51.585
I've encountered him.

22:52.989 --> 22:55.289
What did you think?

22:55.391 --> 22:58.492
I think he has excellent
taste in party planners.

23:05.068 --> 23:07.468
I love Christmas.

23:07.570 --> 23:11.272
The decoration,
the music, it's magical.

23:11.374 --> 23:14.041
You know, the stocking's
always been my favorite part.

23:14.110 --> 23:16.977
You never know what
you'll find inside.

23:17.080 --> 23:21.515
That's right. It could
have candy, toys, jewelry.

23:21.617 --> 23:24.452
You like jewelry?

23:24.554 --> 23:27.455
No, I don't know anything
about jewelry.

23:27.557 --> 23:29.256
Not even
a fantasy wedding ring?

23:29.358 --> 23:31.592
I haven't even thought
about my wedding.

23:31.694 --> 23:34.195
Or the man I'm going to marry,
let alone a ring.

23:34.297 --> 23:36.697
I just feel like,
when you know...

23:37.767 --> 23:39.533
I'll know.

24:13.069 --> 24:15.703
My mother looks at me
like I've never struggled.

24:15.805 --> 24:20.474
But what she doesn't understand
is that, she is my struggle.

24:20.576 --> 24:22.710
I know, I know
I'm very lucky.

24:22.812 --> 24:24.478
I've been in the family
business my entire life.

24:24.580 --> 24:26.647
I understand it
more than anyone else.

24:26.749 --> 24:30.184
And I don't just kick back
and collect gift bags.

24:30.286 --> 24:33.087
Your mother may not
appreciate that, but I do.

24:33.189 --> 24:34.989
-You do?
-Yes.

24:35.091 --> 24:38.125
I'm in a family business with someone
who is a gift bag collector.

24:39.328 --> 24:40.995
I respect what your mother
is trying to do.

24:41.097 --> 24:43.597
She's trying to prevent her son
from being one of those people.

24:43.699 --> 24:45.833
But I can't imagine
how upset I'd feel

24:45.935 --> 24:47.735
if someone thought
I was like that when I wasn't.

24:47.837 --> 24:49.270
Exactly.

24:49.372 --> 24:52.439
I just want my hard work
and ideas to be acknowledged.

24:52.542 --> 24:54.375
Does that make sense?

24:54.477 --> 24:56.110
More than you would know.

24:58.114 --> 25:00.915
I want to know everything.

25:01.017 --> 25:03.050
I really want you
to know about me, I...

25:06.022 --> 25:08.255
I'm just a girl
who's trying to be brave.

25:08.357 --> 25:11.192
How mysterious.

25:12.862 --> 25:16.096
I guess tonight we can
both just be ourselves.

25:16.199 --> 25:19.133
And nobody needs to know
that we're vulnerable.

25:20.169 --> 25:21.402
Or hopeful.

25:23.639 --> 25:24.872
Or romantic.

25:26.008 --> 25:27.408
Or both.

25:28.811 --> 25:31.145
Attention,
Christ-Masqueraders!

25:31.247 --> 25:32.580
It's five minutes
to midnight.

25:32.682 --> 25:34.582
If any of you have found
your match this evening,

25:34.684 --> 25:37.651
please join me front and center
to see what you've won.

25:37.753 --> 25:39.053
Front and center?

25:39.155 --> 25:42.122
That's us. We can finally
take these masks off.

25:42.225 --> 25:43.958
-We're taking our masks off?
-What'd you think?

25:44.060 --> 25:46.227
We have to keep them on
for the rest of our lives?

25:46.329 --> 25:48.896
I hadn't really thought about it.
I was caught up in the moment.

25:48.998 --> 25:51.131
Then stay there.

25:51.234 --> 25:53.467
What if I don't fit in
after I take my mask off?

25:53.569 --> 25:56.337
Fit in?

25:56.405 --> 25:58.872
If you fit in, then you
would've never stood out.

26:00.676 --> 26:02.376
Now if we get
to choose our prize...

26:03.412 --> 26:04.545
what will you pick?

26:07.383 --> 26:08.849
For this moment
to never end.

26:10.253 --> 26:11.518
Me, too.

26:16.292 --> 26:17.825
It's four minutes
to midnight!

26:17.927 --> 26:19.927
Everyone, please start
making your way down.

26:20.029 --> 26:22.029
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I've gotta go.

26:22.131 --> 26:24.932
Of course.
I'll see you down there.

26:26.602 --> 26:28.335
You made it after all.

26:28.437 --> 26:30.504
I told you, you were
meant to wear this dress.

26:30.606 --> 26:32.373
Zelda, what are you doing here?

26:32.475 --> 26:33.774
Have you had
fun tonight?

26:33.876 --> 26:36.343
The best night of my life.

26:36.445 --> 26:38.679
I'm afraid if I don't leave now,
my life is going to be over.

26:38.748 --> 26:40.814
If it's your old life,
how bad is that?

26:40.916 --> 26:43.517
Are you sure you want to
turn your back on the unknown?

26:43.619 --> 26:46.453
The unknown is where everything
you don't have lives.

26:46.555 --> 26:47.988
I'm sorry,
I've gotta go.

27:22.858 --> 27:24.224
-Hey!
-Hey, Angie!

27:24.327 --> 27:25.659
Hey, guys.

27:25.761 --> 27:27.194
You're missing
a heck of a party.

27:27.296 --> 27:29.196
She knows what she's missing.
She planned it.

27:29.298 --> 27:30.931
Don't rub it in.

27:31.033 --> 27:32.900
It's okay. You know how
I love being in the kitchen

27:33.002 --> 27:34.435
cleaning up to the wee
hours of the morning.

27:34.537 --> 27:37.204
I hear Otto's retiring.
Is this good news?

27:37.306 --> 27:39.406
Yeah, the business
is going to be mine.

27:39.508 --> 27:41.342
Eventually.

27:41.444 --> 27:44.211
Finally, end of an era.
What a relief.

27:44.313 --> 27:47.348
Yeah. Hey, we want to throw a "Candace
isn't our boss anymore" party.

27:47.450 --> 27:49.216
-Could you maybe, help us plan that?
-Yeah.

27:49.318 --> 27:50.951
I could give you
a few ideas.

27:51.053 --> 27:54.021
I want to go see what Nicholas
Carmichael considers a grand prize?

27:54.123 --> 27:55.823
-Okay, have fun. Bye.
-Bye.

28:07.636 --> 28:09.737
We have a bit
of a problem here, folks.

28:09.839 --> 28:12.773
We had a match,
but we lost one half of it.

28:12.842 --> 28:15.709
Does anyone know the woman whose
dress matches this stocking?

28:15.811 --> 28:17.478
Anyone?

28:26.222 --> 28:27.955
Hey, Candace.

28:28.057 --> 28:29.656
I'm here.

28:29.759 --> 28:31.558
Tiding up,
as instructed.

28:31.660 --> 28:34.161
You look terrible.
Good night.

28:36.732 --> 28:38.665
Well, Miss,
I hope you're just stuck

28:38.768 --> 28:41.235
in a powder room somewhere
with a broken lock,

28:41.337 --> 28:44.505
because you're depriving my anonymous
friend here of his half of a prize.

28:44.607 --> 28:47.708
And, by the looks of it...

28:50.045 --> 28:51.178
you've broken his heart.

29:02.675 --> 29:04.274
Jenny.

29:04.376 --> 29:06.977
I met the most incredible
man last night

29:07.079 --> 29:13.117
and we talked and then
we danced all night.

29:13.219 --> 29:15.385
Let's see
what's in his stocking.

29:19.558 --> 29:22.192
Maybe I just imagined
how amazing he was.

29:23.229 --> 29:24.428
Because it was
my first night out.

29:25.898 --> 29:27.531
Let's see what's in here.

29:32.238 --> 29:33.370
Broken watch.

29:34.707 --> 29:35.906
He's mysterious.

29:40.813 --> 29:44.114
A rock. So...
he likes the outdoors.

29:44.216 --> 29:45.415
Good.

29:51.790 --> 29:52.923
He's homely.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.059
Spearhead gum.

29:56.162 --> 29:57.494
He was sentimental last night.

29:57.596 --> 29:59.796
There's got to be more
into this than fresh breath.

30:01.267 --> 30:02.733
Wait, what's this?

30:07.673 --> 30:10.674
And funny, look!

30:17.917 --> 30:19.016
He's perfect.

30:21.654 --> 30:23.153
How am I ever going
to find him again?

30:24.490 --> 30:26.056
-Any luck?
-No.

30:26.125 --> 30:28.392
And I've called every
single name on this list.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.360
What did you tell 'em?

30:30.462 --> 30:33.530
I said that something valuable was
mistakenly left in one of the stockings

30:33.632 --> 30:36.066
and then I had them describe
the stocking that they brought

30:36.168 --> 30:38.368
and the stocking that they picked
and I told them that I was you,

30:38.470 --> 30:40.037
so they wouldn't lie to me.

30:40.139 --> 30:41.672
Well, you tried, right?

30:41.774 --> 30:43.307
She said that she
wouldn't fit in.

30:45.177 --> 30:47.878
Maybe she wasn't
invited directly.

30:47.980 --> 30:49.546
She's got to be
one of the plus ones.

30:49.648 --> 30:51.682
-Or maybe she snuck in.
-No.

30:51.784 --> 30:53.016
How could someone sneak in?

30:53.118 --> 30:55.385
An employee, maybe. Or
maybe she stole an invite.

30:55.487 --> 30:58.388
Sneaking in is one thing,
but she's not a thief.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.557
Can you get me a list
of all the workers...

31:00.659 --> 31:02.793
-caterers, valet, band...
-I don't have all that.

31:02.895 --> 31:04.127
They were hired
by the event planner.

31:04.230 --> 31:05.762
Can you get me the number
to the event planner?

31:05.864 --> 31:07.464
They're downstairs right now
finishing clean up.

31:17.710 --> 31:19.076
I'm going to go look around.

31:19.178 --> 31:21.111
See if we left anything in any
other parts of the house.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.880
Candace, people let us into their homes
because they trust us to be professional.

31:23.983 --> 31:25.716
Don't go snoop.

31:25.818 --> 31:27.918
I didn't keep ice on my face all
night, then wake up at 6:00 a.m.

31:28.020 --> 31:29.953
and spend three hours
in a salon on hair and make-up

31:30.055 --> 31:32.155
just to hide in the kitchen.

31:32.258 --> 31:34.291
We were supposed to have
our moment last night.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.193
We were meant to have it,
so I'm going to get it.

31:44.336 --> 31:45.669
I'm so sorry.
Let me help you.

31:45.771 --> 31:47.237
Thank you.

31:50.075 --> 31:51.275
Have we met?

31:54.847 --> 31:56.413
Sort of.

31:56.515 --> 31:58.148
Last night at the ball.

31:58.250 --> 32:01.652
No. I was just with the
clean-up crew after midnight.

32:01.754 --> 32:04.421
But we have met before
with my cousin.

32:04.523 --> 32:06.156
Your cousin?

32:06.258 --> 32:08.759
-The one that I invited to the ball.
-Yeah. The one and only.

32:08.861 --> 32:12.429
Is she here right now? -Yeah.
Yeah. She's just right...

32:13.699 --> 32:14.731
through there.

32:21.807 --> 32:23.607
Nicholas.

32:23.709 --> 32:25.542
-You!
-Candace.

32:25.644 --> 32:26.643
Candace.

32:27.713 --> 32:29.646
-Last night, you...
-I abandoned you.

32:29.748 --> 32:31.481
I apologize from the bottom
of my heart, honestly.

32:31.583 --> 32:33.684
What happened? I looked
everywhere for you.

32:33.786 --> 32:37.220
I wanted so badly to be there, but I
had an allergic reaction just before...

32:37.323 --> 32:39.356
Wait, before? When?

32:39.458 --> 32:42.192
At about 4:45 yesterday.

32:42.294 --> 32:43.894
I'm confused.

32:43.996 --> 32:46.063
Where were you
at midnight?

32:46.165 --> 32:48.198
In bed icing
down my face.

32:48.300 --> 32:49.833
So you weren't
even at the ball?

32:49.935 --> 32:52.002
No, silly, that's what
I've been trying to tell you.

32:54.173 --> 32:55.972
Nic... Nicholas.

32:56.075 --> 32:58.141
- Where are you...
- ...going?

32:58.243 --> 33:01.345
-I get that you liked her.
-Don't use past tense.

33:01.447 --> 33:03.013
I get that you like her.

33:03.115 --> 33:05.015
But maybe, it's because she ran
off, so you can't have her.

33:05.117 --> 33:06.817
Don't say "can't."

33:06.919 --> 33:08.685
Okay, what do you
plan to do if...

33:09.688 --> 33:11.488
When you find her.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.557
You're going to say, "Hey, maybe
we should hang out sometime

33:13.659 --> 33:15.926
as long as you're not looking
for something serious."

33:16.028 --> 33:17.694
She doesn't sound like
the type to go for that.

33:17.796 --> 33:19.663
No, no, she's not.

33:19.765 --> 33:21.198
But maybe I don't
want that from her.

33:21.300 --> 33:22.265
Well, what do you want?

33:22.368 --> 33:23.533
You know,
for the first time,

33:23.635 --> 33:26.269
and I might be completely
crazy, but I think...

33:26.372 --> 33:30.340
No! I know that I want with her
what all my exes wanted with me.

33:30.442 --> 33:32.409
Marriage?

33:32.511 --> 33:35.178
Well, how do you
propose to find her, man?

33:36.215 --> 33:38.515
"Propose to find her."

33:38.617 --> 33:40.484
You're a genius, Max.

33:54.566 --> 33:56.733
-What are you doing?
-I'm just... Wait.

33:56.835 --> 33:58.402
Are you calling me
from the living room?

33:58.504 --> 34:00.537
If it's not watching the Nicholas
Carmichael announcement,

34:00.639 --> 34:02.105
stop it and start that.

34:02.207 --> 34:04.641
He just left us a message booking
us again for Christmas Eve.

34:04.743 --> 34:06.076
He's using us again!

34:06.178 --> 34:08.078
That's amazing! Yes!

34:08.179 --> 34:09.146
I knew that ball was key.

34:09.248 --> 34:12.248
Not just a party.
His wedding.

34:12.351 --> 34:14.050
To some mystery woman.

34:14.152 --> 34:16.719
Of all the events for me
to miss, it should've been me.

34:16.822 --> 34:18.054
What should've been you?

34:18.157 --> 34:21.158
The mystery woman he met
at the ball, obviously.

34:21.260 --> 34:22.259
Nicholas Carmichael?

34:22.360 --> 34:24.127
Angie...

34:24.228 --> 34:26.163
How can you run an event
planning business

34:26.264 --> 34:29.065
that caters to high society
when you're so out of touch?

34:29.168 --> 34:31.601
I'm sending
you the link.

34:31.703 --> 34:33.804
His message said to bring him
some ideas in the morning

34:33.906 --> 34:35.739
and as you still work for me,
that means you.

34:35.841 --> 34:37.741
I'm too upset to work.

34:42.347 --> 34:44.581
I'm looking for the woman
that brought this stocking

34:44.683 --> 34:46.683
to my Christ-Masquerade ball.

34:46.752 --> 34:49.686
There was to be a prize for any two
guests that chose each other's stocking.

34:49.788 --> 34:52.255
Two guests did,
but one disappeared

34:52.357 --> 34:54.291
before the prize
was presented.

34:54.393 --> 34:57.360
I've decided that the prize,
as host of the party

34:57.463 --> 35:00.030
and also the second half
of the winning team,

35:00.132 --> 35:01.965
is to be a wedding.

35:02.067 --> 35:04.734
On Christmas Eve to me.

35:06.305 --> 35:08.939
I fell in love with the woman
behind the mask.

35:09.041 --> 35:11.942
And unless
I'm completely crazy...

35:12.044 --> 35:15.812
you fell in love with me,
Nicholas Carmichael.

35:39.071 --> 35:43.139
How can this be the man that I spent the
most magical night of my life with?

35:43.242 --> 35:44.708
Look.

35:44.810 --> 35:48.211
Jenny, I won't miss out
on the man I met at the ball.

35:48.313 --> 35:52.148
But if I come clean and tell Candace
I was there, she's going to flip!

35:52.251 --> 35:55.685
I'm pretty sure I can kiss any chance
of me running the business goodbye.

35:58.123 --> 35:59.890
But I won't risk
losing it all,

35:59.992 --> 36:02.492
if what these magazines
say about him is true.

36:04.129 --> 36:04.861
I've got to be sure.

36:22.598 --> 36:24.664
I may have made
a huge mistake.

36:30.906 --> 36:32.305
Yes?

36:32.407 --> 36:34.574
Are you my first candidate?

36:34.676 --> 36:36.877
No.

36:36.979 --> 36:38.979
I'm Angie. I'm the...

36:42.084 --> 36:45.518
I'm here to plan
your Christmas wedding.

36:45.621 --> 36:47.420
I think there's
been a mistake.

36:47.522 --> 36:50.757
I wanted whoever did the ball.
Constance or something.

36:52.661 --> 36:55.228
Have we ever met?

36:55.330 --> 36:57.998
Yes, several times actually.

36:58.100 --> 37:00.033
I planned your
Christ-Masquerade ball.

37:00.135 --> 37:01.935
I work with
my cousin Candace.

37:02.037 --> 37:05.772
Okay.
Well, then I misunderstood.

37:05.874 --> 37:08.441
Well, if I liked the ball before
I like it even more now

37:08.543 --> 37:11.645
that's it solely responsible for
me meeting the love of my life.

37:12.714 --> 37:14.714
The love of your life?

37:14.816 --> 37:16.750
You think I'd just marry
someone who wasn't?

37:16.852 --> 37:21.421
I just find it difficult to believe
that it's the love of your life

37:21.523 --> 37:23.456
after just spending
a few hours with her.

37:23.558 --> 37:25.625
Well, that's exactly
how I know.

37:25.727 --> 37:27.360
You see, I've met
more outstanding women

37:27.462 --> 37:29.763
than most men do
in their entire lives.

37:29.865 --> 37:33.233
So for a woman to stand out
to me, well...

37:33.335 --> 37:35.268
it's very rare.

37:35.337 --> 37:39.472
Well, in my experience it's very rare
for you to remember a woman at all.

37:41.843 --> 37:43.777
Do you speak to all
of your clients like this?

37:43.879 --> 37:46.046
No. Never.

37:48.016 --> 37:49.549
I must have forgotten
myself, too.

37:51.320 --> 37:54.254
I'm sorry. How can I help you, Mr.
Carmichael?

37:54.356 --> 37:58.458
I met a beautiful, confident
woman who truly understands me,

37:58.560 --> 38:02.162
and I want to marry her here
in my house, where we met.

38:02.264 --> 38:04.264
Now I know that
she loves Christmas.

38:04.366 --> 38:08.301
So I was thinking, we could have a
perfect classic Christmas wedding.

38:08.403 --> 38:09.836
I had the same idea, too.

38:13.375 --> 38:16.076
But what happens
if you don't find her?

38:17.279 --> 38:18.778
What do you mean?

38:18.880 --> 38:20.347
Well, what if you
don't recognize her

38:20.449 --> 38:22.449
when she's standing
right in front of you?

38:22.551 --> 38:25.685
I will.
And also, she'll tell me.

38:28.290 --> 38:30.790
Like all those women
outside are telling you.

38:30.892 --> 38:32.792
But they can't all be her.

38:32.894 --> 38:35.428
How can you tell
if they're fake or real?

38:35.530 --> 38:37.630
And what happens if she
doesn't want to marry you.

38:37.733 --> 38:39.699
Who wouldn't want
to marry me?

38:42.204 --> 38:44.604
All right, well, that's
one checked off the list.

38:44.706 --> 38:46.239
Several thousand more to go.

38:47.876 --> 38:49.442
How can you be so sure
I'm not her?

38:49.544 --> 38:51.511
I'm positive
you're not.

38:51.613 --> 38:53.880
-How can you tell for sure?
-Simple.

38:53.982 --> 38:56.449
The woman
I'm looking for likes me.

38:56.551 --> 38:58.985
Why are you asking me
all these prying questions?

38:59.087 --> 39:01.788
I'm just trying to get into
the mind set of the happy couple,

39:01.890 --> 39:04.124
so I can make sure you have
the best wedding possible.

39:04.226 --> 39:07.961
Well, we both
loved the ball.

39:08.063 --> 39:11.164
-So, I trust your judgment.
-Thanks.

39:11.266 --> 39:13.066
I really need to get
back to these interviews.

39:13.168 --> 39:17.337
So if you could just leave the sketches,
I will approve or give notes.

39:17.472 --> 39:21.007
And just like last time, we probably
won't have to see each other,

39:21.109 --> 39:24.844
which I presume will be
amenable to us both.

39:24.946 --> 39:26.546
Yes.

39:26.648 --> 39:29.382
We definitely work better when
we don't have to see each other.

39:43.698 --> 39:45.165
Jenny!

39:45.267 --> 39:47.000
How does one come
to throw their own wedding

39:47.102 --> 39:49.335
without having
any intention of attending it?

39:49.438 --> 39:51.838
I'm getting to think I'm as
nuts as Nicholas Carmichael.

39:55.610 --> 39:58.578
Tabloids! Wonders never cease.

39:58.680 --> 40:00.914
And all about
Nicholas Carmichael.

40:01.016 --> 40:02.348
Thought you couldn't stand him.

40:02.451 --> 40:04.117
I can't. I'm just trying
to get to know him

40:04.219 --> 40:06.219
without actually
having to talk to him.

40:06.321 --> 40:07.587
So shy.

40:07.689 --> 40:10.457
Hey, you were over
there this morning.

40:10.559 --> 40:13.359
What's the inside scoop? Has he
found his mystery woman yet?

40:13.462 --> 40:15.395
No, and he won't.

40:15.497 --> 40:17.764
So I've still
got a shot.

40:17.866 --> 40:19.265
What do you mean?

40:19.367 --> 40:21.734
I mean, if he's not going
to find the real girl anyway,

40:21.837 --> 40:22.969
why couldn't it be me?

40:25.740 --> 40:26.973
Hello?

40:28.810 --> 40:31.911
You two'd be
perfect for each other.

40:33.748 --> 40:35.415
Do you need something, Candace?

40:35.517 --> 40:38.885
Yes! My dress from the ball.
I want to return it.

40:38.987 --> 40:40.320
It's final sale.

40:40.422 --> 40:42.088
That's what they always say.

40:59.708 --> 41:00.840
I've seen this dress.

41:02.043 --> 41:03.510
Can't have.

41:05.013 --> 41:08.414
Yes. I have.

41:08.550 --> 41:11.151
It's all over the Internet.

41:11.253 --> 41:13.820
Someone snuck a camera
into the party

41:13.922 --> 41:16.956
and took a picture of the woman
wearing this dress...

41:17.058 --> 41:18.958
dancing with
Nicholas Carmichael.

41:20.795 --> 41:23.296
It's from behind,
but the dress... Well...

41:23.398 --> 41:26.366
this dress is very distinctive.

41:26.434 --> 41:29.969
And it bears a striking resemblance
to the mystery stocking.

41:30.071 --> 41:33.439
Come on, Candace. Don't let
your imagination run wild.

41:36.545 --> 41:37.911
You went to the ball.

41:39.147 --> 41:40.780
Candace, I can explain...

41:40.882 --> 41:42.115
No need to explain.

41:44.953 --> 41:48.855
Christmas miracles
don't need to be explained.

41:48.957 --> 41:51.991
Wait. I'm confused.
You're happy?

41:52.093 --> 41:53.660
I'm ecstatic.

41:53.762 --> 41:56.529
Now we can convince
Nicholas that you were me.

41:56.631 --> 41:57.964
What?

41:58.066 --> 42:00.733
No, I don't think so.

42:00.835 --> 42:04.904
Not even to have your very own
successful event planning business...

42:06.007 --> 42:07.173
all to yourself...

42:08.643 --> 42:09.976
free of me...

42:11.012 --> 42:14.047
forever?

42:14.149 --> 42:17.650
And all you have to do is
give Nicholas the little nudge

42:17.752 --> 42:19.419
that he needs to be mine.

42:24.025 --> 42:26.092
You want me to trick him?

42:26.194 --> 42:28.761
Well, you already tricked him.

42:28.863 --> 42:32.699
It was supposed to be me
in this dress and at the ball.

42:32.801 --> 42:35.401
He invited me, not you.

42:35.503 --> 42:37.870
He was expecting me.

42:39.808 --> 42:42.875
And you said,
we're perfect for each other.

42:48.383 --> 42:49.849
Maybe you're right.

42:51.786 --> 42:54.320
Maybe he was going to marry
whoever was at that ball.

42:55.323 --> 42:57.290
That's the spirit.

42:57.392 --> 42:59.259
You can fill me in
on everything while I shop

42:59.361 --> 43:00.627
for my engagement
outfit for tomorrow.

43:13.842 --> 43:15.174
-Hey.
-Hi.

43:18.613 --> 43:19.879
So that's how they
make those?

43:21.116 --> 43:22.448
Yup.

43:23.785 --> 43:24.951
This stuff smells great.

43:25.053 --> 43:26.519
You don't want to touch that...

43:26.621 --> 43:28.054
-Yup.
-It's covered in glue.

43:28.156 --> 43:29.722
-Now you have glue on your hands.
-I'm sorry.

43:29.824 --> 43:31.791
-Can you not touch anything?
-I'm sorry!

43:33.161 --> 43:34.661
Let me get that.
Cool.

43:37.966 --> 43:39.766
Thank you.

43:39.868 --> 43:42.302
You've actually got a few
pieces in your hair.

43:42.404 --> 43:45.038
- What? No.
- Would you mind if I...

43:46.241 --> 43:48.141
Sorry.

43:48.243 --> 43:51.244
Thank you. Silly.
Thank you for that.

43:53.048 --> 43:54.213
Can I help?

43:55.684 --> 43:57.917
Yes, as long as you
don't break anything.

43:58.019 --> 43:59.352
I'll try.

44:01.356 --> 44:03.556
I do remember you now.

44:03.658 --> 44:05.558
-You do?
-Yeah.

44:05.660 --> 44:06.959
Before, I remember
talking to you.

44:07.062 --> 44:08.561
You said you worked
the ball after midnight.

44:10.231 --> 44:11.798
Right. Yeah.

44:11.900 --> 44:13.399
Yeah, I did.

44:13.501 --> 44:15.735
She disappeared at midnight.

44:18.873 --> 44:22.075
Well, I thought you ruled
me out because...

44:22.177 --> 44:23.543
the woman has to like you.

44:24.946 --> 44:26.179
You like me.

44:26.281 --> 44:27.513
I can tell.

44:27.615 --> 44:29.382
I do, do I?

44:30.452 --> 44:32.485
Well...

44:32.587 --> 44:33.853
you don't like me, so...

44:34.923 --> 44:36.022
I guess we're
in the clear.

44:39.361 --> 44:40.593
I like you.

44:42.597 --> 44:44.230
Angie?

44:45.767 --> 44:49.302
Nicholas, you remember
my cousin Candace, right?

44:49.404 --> 44:51.771
Of course.
Hello, Candace.

44:51.873 --> 44:53.873
Right. Well...

44:55.377 --> 44:56.976
she's the woman
you've been looking for.

45:01.116 --> 45:02.148
What do you mean?

45:03.151 --> 45:04.384
The stocking was hers.

45:06.221 --> 45:07.387
Search over.

45:08.723 --> 45:10.523
I don't understand.

45:10.625 --> 45:12.792
You told me that
you didn't go to the ball.

45:12.894 --> 45:15.561
I was scared.
You were so intense,

45:15.663 --> 45:18.731
I was afraid of losing your
future business with our company.

45:18.833 --> 45:21.234
I take my work
very seriously.

45:21.336 --> 45:23.169
That's right.

45:23.271 --> 45:24.637
You do.

45:24.739 --> 45:27.473
And of course, I had no idea
it was you who I'd fall...

45:27.575 --> 45:29.575
Who I met at the ball.

45:29.677 --> 45:31.344
So you do feel
the same way.

45:31.446 --> 45:32.478
How could I not?

45:32.580 --> 45:34.514
Then why did you
disappear that night?

45:34.616 --> 45:36.416
I had to get back
to the kitchen.

45:36.518 --> 45:39.652
A job well done is the
most valuable prize to me.

45:39.754 --> 45:43.890
And it wasn't until later I realized I
had no idea how I was going to find you.

45:43.992 --> 45:45.892
And once I learned
who you were,

45:45.994 --> 45:47.627
I was nervous
to say something because...

45:48.663 --> 45:50.596
Well, you're you.

45:50.698 --> 45:52.231
And I'm just the owner
of several successful

45:52.333 --> 45:54.300
small businesses
I run with my bare hands.

46:05.880 --> 46:07.213
Grab your tissues, ladies,

46:07.315 --> 46:10.416
Nicholas Carmichael
is officially off the market.

46:10.518 --> 46:14.554
After a bizarre video call to the missing
party guest he wanted to make his bride,

46:14.656 --> 46:18.357
the ultimate bachelor has finally
found his Princess Charming.

46:34.542 --> 46:36.909
Nicholas? Are you home?

46:38.480 --> 46:40.246
Mother, what are
you doing here?

46:40.348 --> 46:42.782
I saw on the news
you were getting married,

46:42.884 --> 46:46.919
and I felt for sure you were
taken hostage or something.

46:47.021 --> 46:50.490
Well, I made a video saying that I was looking
for the woman that I wanted to marry,

46:50.592 --> 46:53.226
but I never told anyone
that I found her.

46:53.328 --> 46:55.595
I'm not quite sure
how that got out,

46:55.697 --> 46:57.396
but good timing though,
because this is her.

46:57.499 --> 46:58.831
This is Candace Carrillo.

46:58.933 --> 47:01.968
Victoria, it's so
nice to meet you.

47:02.070 --> 47:04.504
Please call me
Mrs. Carmichael.

47:04.606 --> 47:07.473
And she owns
an event planning business

47:07.575 --> 47:09.842
that threw my
Christ-Masquerade ball.

47:09.944 --> 47:11.677
That's me.
Work, work, work.

47:11.779 --> 47:15.448
Well, there's nothing I value more
than an entrepreneurial spirit.

47:15.550 --> 47:17.617
Perhaps we can help you
expand down the road.

47:17.719 --> 47:20.253
Thank you for the offer,
but I'll have to pass.

47:20.355 --> 47:23.356
See, my underprivileged cousin
has lived with my father and I

47:23.458 --> 47:25.958
since her parents died
when she was six.

47:26.060 --> 47:28.327
I think it's only fair that
I share my good fortune

47:28.429 --> 47:30.263
and let her take over
the businesses.

47:31.399 --> 47:32.665
Really?

47:32.767 --> 47:35.134
Well, I'm going to have
my own new family soon,

47:35.236 --> 47:37.136
with their own
business interests.

47:37.238 --> 47:38.638
It'd be greedy of me
to keep my own,

47:38.740 --> 47:40.606
depriving my cousin
of a bright future.

47:41.809 --> 47:44.076
Nicholas, darling,
may I have a word?

47:45.813 --> 47:47.980
I'll be just a minute.

47:55.523 --> 47:57.657
Well, don't be too happy for me.

47:57.759 --> 47:59.225
I needn't worry about that.

47:59.327 --> 48:02.261
Isn't this what you wanted?
I'm settling down,

48:02.363 --> 48:04.864
I'm experiencing the grand
institution of marriage.

48:04.933 --> 48:08.100
And making a mockery of it
with a media circus and...

48:09.304 --> 48:11.170
Well, I won't insult
your fiancée.

48:11.272 --> 48:14.040
All I know is that after
all your big talk about

48:14.142 --> 48:16.809
finding the one,
you couldn't let get away.

48:18.112 --> 48:19.645
I was expecting
something different.

48:20.782 --> 48:21.847
She is different.

48:23.818 --> 48:26.118
-She seems...
-She's not herself right now.

48:26.220 --> 48:28.120
It's a very unusual situation
that she's in.

48:28.222 --> 48:30.523
Stop trying to make me happy.

48:30.625 --> 48:33.559
Can she make you happy?

48:33.661 --> 48:37.296
The point isn't to get married just so you
can claim your inheritance, Nicholas.

48:37.398 --> 48:38.864
The point is to grow up!

48:40.902 --> 48:42.034
Find someone...

48:43.504 --> 48:45.671
who makes you see
what is truly...

48:47.508 --> 48:49.842
truly important in life.

48:58.219 --> 49:01.387
I just have those sketches for the
wedding reception for you to look over.

49:01.489 --> 49:03.589
Angie, wait.

49:03.691 --> 49:06.726
That wasn't what
you think.

49:06.828 --> 49:08.361
You don't have to explain
yourself, Nicholas.

49:11.532 --> 49:12.565
Really.

49:20.725 --> 49:21.891
Candace was not at that ball.

49:21.993 --> 49:24.560
Some poor girl is getting scammed
out of a jackpot marriage

49:24.629 --> 49:26.662
and so is Nicholas Carmichael.

49:26.764 --> 49:31.267
Is he? Maybe he has an ulterior
motive for getting married.

49:31.369 --> 49:32.535
Come on, I don't think so.

49:32.637 --> 49:34.637
He was so sincere
in that video,

49:34.739 --> 49:37.973
and he loved your ball,
so he has taste.

49:38.076 --> 49:39.608
Yeah, but if he's
marrying Candace,

49:39.711 --> 49:42.611
he's clearly not the brightest
bulb in the strand, right?

49:42.714 --> 49:44.280
I'm going to send him
an anonymous note.

49:44.382 --> 49:45.514
No!

49:45.616 --> 49:47.183
What, you want Candace
to get away with this?

49:47.285 --> 49:49.285
We had a deal, remember?

49:49.387 --> 49:52.355
I help convince Nicholas that it was her
and she gives me the business. So, yay!

49:52.457 --> 49:53.989
Why would you be
able to convince him?

49:54.092 --> 49:55.791
The only people
that know what happened

49:55.893 --> 49:57.760
between him and that woman
are him and that woman.

49:59.497 --> 50:01.364
Holy night!

50:01.466 --> 50:03.566
You are the woman!
You went to the ball!

50:03.668 --> 50:05.501
It was totally you!

50:05.603 --> 50:08.938
You know, I always thought Candace
needed to walk a mile in your shoes,

50:09.040 --> 50:10.740
Angie, but this was not
what I had in mind.

50:10.842 --> 50:13.409
Come on, what's the big deal?
Everyone gets what they want.

50:13.511 --> 50:15.211
Carmichael doesn't!
He's in love with you!

50:15.313 --> 50:17.179
He's not
in love with me.

50:17.281 --> 50:18.614
He thinks Candace is me.

50:18.716 --> 50:21.917
So you're going to let
him ruin his life?

50:22.019 --> 50:23.719
Look, the guy I met at the ball

50:23.821 --> 50:26.389
was sweet and charming
and sincere.

50:28.192 --> 50:30.893
The guy in there,
he has his own agenda.

50:30.962 --> 50:33.562
I'm not being a pawn
in someone else's game.

50:33.664 --> 50:36.432
Come on, guys, it's about time
I look out for myself for once.

50:36.534 --> 50:39.402
Yeah, but Ang, when you
fall in love with someone,

50:39.504 --> 50:42.037
looking out for one of you
is looking out for both of you.

50:42.140 --> 50:43.639
Love?

50:43.741 --> 50:45.708
How could I love
Nicholas Carmichael?

50:45.810 --> 50:47.943
I'm not even sure
which him is him.

50:48.012 --> 50:49.645
Now I know
these don't look splashy,

50:49.747 --> 50:51.647
but they're all
one-of-a-kind pieces.

50:51.749 --> 50:54.717
Vintage, modern,
all unique.

50:54.819 --> 50:57.119
Which I thought
might make you happy.

50:57.221 --> 50:59.255
Have you given further
thought to what you might want?

51:01.058 --> 51:02.458
I don't know.

51:02.560 --> 51:05.060
Maybe a five-carat pink diamond
with white diamond accents

51:05.163 --> 51:07.263
and an eternity triple
shank band in rose gold?

51:08.366 --> 51:10.766
Or something like that?

51:10.868 --> 51:13.636
I thought you didn't know
much about jewelry.

51:13.738 --> 51:15.738
Why would you think that?

51:15.840 --> 51:18.507
Because that's what
you told me at the ball.

51:18.609 --> 51:21.911
You said that you'd never
envisioned your wedding

51:22.013 --> 51:24.747
or your husband
or your ring.

51:24.849 --> 51:29.685
You said that you believed that when the
time was right, you'd just... know.

51:31.022 --> 51:33.622
See, that's what happened.

51:33.724 --> 51:36.025
I got here
and I just knew.

51:36.127 --> 51:37.760
Do you know how you're going
to propose to me yet?

51:39.263 --> 51:41.297
Didn't I already do
that in the video?

51:41.399 --> 51:44.300
Well, typically, a man makes
a grand public proclamation

51:44.402 --> 51:45.935
of his love on one knee.

51:46.037 --> 51:49.338
Right. Of course, I guess
I wasn't on one knee.

51:49.440 --> 51:51.040
How thoughtless of me.

51:51.108 --> 51:54.143
Of course.
I will plan something.

51:54.245 --> 51:56.879
Tomorrow? Around sunset
for the best lighting.

51:58.316 --> 51:59.982
Okay.

52:04.655 --> 52:06.455
You've got to help me.

52:06.557 --> 52:07.556
What is it now, Candace?

52:07.658 --> 52:09.124
Nicholas knows
some thing's wrong.

52:09.227 --> 52:11.393
- Really? Right.
- I think so.

52:13.231 --> 52:14.530
What? What do you
want me to do about it?

52:14.632 --> 52:16.499
You know those
little ear pieces

52:16.601 --> 52:19.301
you use at parties to
communicate with the employees?

52:20.304 --> 52:21.537
You cannot be serious.

52:21.639 --> 52:23.639
You just have to listen in
on a couple of dates.

52:23.741 --> 52:26.509
Feed me some lines, and save me if he
references something I don't know.

52:26.611 --> 52:28.644
Candace, that's absurd. No.

52:28.746 --> 52:31.413
I just need you to help me convince him
that I'm the woman that he met at the ball,

52:31.516 --> 52:34.483
so that he'll relax and let
himself fall in love with me.

52:34.585 --> 52:37.086
He has some major
trust issues.

52:37.188 --> 52:39.455
Well, I can't
imagine why.

52:41.025 --> 52:42.525
What are we
doing out here, Nicholas?

52:42.627 --> 52:45.528
Well, it's dusk, like you
said, so I thought...

52:45.630 --> 52:47.897
Do you not like restaurants?

52:47.999 --> 52:50.232
I thought that the place where
we almost shared our first kiss

52:50.334 --> 52:51.634
might be a bit more meaningful.

52:51.736 --> 52:54.036
The front of the house.

52:54.138 --> 52:55.971
Right... here...

52:56.073 --> 52:58.941
in the front of the house.

52:59.043 --> 53:00.409
At the ball...

53:00.511 --> 53:04.446
when I first met you...
Well, when I first saw you...

53:04.549 --> 53:06.448
I knew you were different.

53:06.551 --> 53:07.950
Are you starting?

53:10.354 --> 53:11.820
Is that a selfie stick?

53:11.923 --> 53:14.156
Well, that's the price of
you making this so private.

53:14.258 --> 53:15.991
I know
it's a little obtrusive,

53:16.093 --> 53:18.827
but if I don't film it,
who will?

53:18.930 --> 53:21.030
I mean, we wanna remember
this forever, don't we?

53:22.366 --> 53:24.199
Okay, I can go
along with that.

53:25.570 --> 53:26.969
He's going with it?

53:27.071 --> 53:30.472
In a sea of masks,
I only saw you.

53:30.575 --> 53:33.042
I was drawn to you,
and when I got to know you,

53:33.144 --> 53:35.277
I became even more certain that
I was meant to be with you.

53:36.280 --> 53:39.214
You're so smart,
you're fun,

53:39.317 --> 53:41.183
you're beautiful...

53:41.285 --> 53:43.652
and you understand me.

53:43.754 --> 53:46.488
I want to feel the way that I felt at
that ball for the rest of my life.

53:48.759 --> 53:50.926
I never want that
moment to disappear.

53:52.496 --> 53:53.629
Candace Carrillo...

53:53.731 --> 53:55.831
Carrillo. Carmichael.

53:55.933 --> 53:58.400
I don't have to change
my initials.

53:58.502 --> 54:00.536
It's so cute when that happens.
It's like it was meant to be.

54:00.638 --> 54:02.838
Yeah, well, I was
the one at the ball.

54:02.940 --> 54:04.840
It isn't about you.

54:04.942 --> 54:06.075
Sorry?

54:06.177 --> 54:07.676
What did I miss?
Did you say something?

54:07.778 --> 54:10.879
Yeah, 
will you marry me?

54:10.982 --> 54:12.881
Yes, of course.

54:17.488 --> 54:19.655
My ring! Where did it go?

54:19.757 --> 54:22.391
I think it landed
in the pond.

54:22.493 --> 54:24.693
Can we just clean that one up
or do you need a whole new one?

54:24.795 --> 54:27.062
A whole new one.

54:27.164 --> 54:29.632
We're going to have
to re-shoot this anyway.

54:34.271 --> 54:35.704
Such a waste.

54:35.806 --> 54:37.573
How long till
dinner's ready?

54:37.675 --> 54:40.042
My words and memories
are one thing, Candace...

54:40.144 --> 54:41.744
Actually, they're two.

54:41.846 --> 54:43.178
But promising you'll
cook him dinner?

54:43.280 --> 54:45.881
-You can't cook.
-Where are the glasses?

54:45.983 --> 54:48.117
This was his idea,
believe me.

54:48.219 --> 54:52.087
I was pushing for the rooftop
Michelin star restaurant downtown,

54:52.189 --> 54:54.390
but he loves some beefy puffs
you made at the ball

54:54.492 --> 54:56.058
and asked
if I would make him some.

55:16.914 --> 55:18.347
Do you need to keep
an eye on the kitchen?

55:18.449 --> 55:19.948
We can hang out
in there if you want.

55:20.051 --> 55:24.319
No! No. The beef can practically
puff itself up at this point.

55:24.388 --> 55:26.855
You make this all look
so effortless.

55:26.957 --> 55:30.859
Angie's always sweating. She's got her
hair sticking out all over her head.

55:30.961 --> 55:32.461
She's on her knees
half the time.

55:32.563 --> 55:34.830
Tell me about it,
she's a disaster.

55:34.932 --> 55:37.166
Not a good idea to insult
the person cooking your food.

55:37.268 --> 55:39.468
I kind of think it's cute
how frazzled she gets.

55:39.570 --> 55:43.772
I can't really think that she's just
a pay-check and gift bag collector.

55:43.874 --> 55:47.309
It must've been just some sibling-like spat
that you were having that night, right?

55:47.411 --> 55:48.777
-What?
-Repeat.

55:48.879 --> 55:51.380
"After a good dinner,
one can forgive anybody,

55:51.482 --> 55:54.049
even one's own relations."
Oscar Wilde. Say it.

55:54.151 --> 55:56.885
"After a good dinner,
one can forgive anybody.

55:56.987 --> 56:00.222
Even one's own relations."
Oscar Wilde.

56:00.324 --> 56:02.391
It really is you.

56:02.493 --> 56:04.893
Yes. What can I say?

56:04.995 --> 56:08.030
I just prefer other people's
thoughts to my own.

56:08.132 --> 56:12.868
Especially really old people who
weren't limited to 140 characters.

56:12.970 --> 56:16.739
No, but really, why do you have
something like that memorized?

56:16.841 --> 56:20.075
Some people know how to say things
in a way that makes people listen

56:20.177 --> 56:21.310
and remember who said it.

56:22.313 --> 56:24.179
It's a talent
I wish I had.

56:24.281 --> 56:27.616
Some people know how to say things in
a way that make other people listen

56:27.685 --> 56:29.218
and remember who said it.

56:29.320 --> 56:31.487
It's a talent I wish I had.

56:31.589 --> 56:33.088
I remember everything you said.

56:33.190 --> 56:36.892
I even remember when you
accidentally thanked me at the ball

56:36.994 --> 56:38.060
for raving about
the beef puffs.

56:38.162 --> 56:39.995
Okay, enough about
the beefy puffs.

56:40.097 --> 56:43.198
Don't you think it's odd that we're
going to be married in two weeks

56:43.300 --> 56:44.600
and we haven't
even kissed yet?

56:45.970 --> 56:47.536
Well, now that
you mentioned it.

56:53.344 --> 56:55.177
You're different
in real life.

56:55.279 --> 56:58.080
I warned you.
I was trying to be brave.

56:58.182 --> 57:00.849
I warned you.
I was trying to be brave.

57:01.886 --> 57:03.852
Yes. Yes, you certainly did.

57:03.954 --> 57:06.288
You know, something
that I think is amazing,

57:06.390 --> 57:08.423
we've never
actually discussed.

57:08.526 --> 57:09.858
Honeymoon destinations?

57:09.960 --> 57:13.495
No. No, the items
in our stockings.

57:13.564 --> 57:15.130
Right.

57:15.232 --> 57:18.534
I would love to hear what you
think the meaning of mine were.

57:18.636 --> 57:20.936
You're on.

57:21.038 --> 57:23.772
The only thing I know about broken clocks
is that they're right twice a day.

57:23.874 --> 57:26.341
Broken clocks are right
twice a day?

57:26.410 --> 57:30.445
Yes! Yes, that's the closest thing
I've ever gotten to a life philosophy.

57:30.548 --> 57:32.247
We really are meant
to be together.

57:32.349 --> 57:33.916
Yes, we are.

57:34.018 --> 57:37.586
I can't believe
that you guessed that.

57:38.956 --> 57:40.856
Okay, well, what about
the Spearhead gum?

57:40.958 --> 57:44.626
The gum is obviously because you
like to have fresh breath for kissing.

57:44.728 --> 57:48.130
No, that's the first product
that I ever got to spearhead.

57:48.199 --> 57:50.432
That's why I called
the gum Spearhead.

57:50.534 --> 57:54.436
I got to supervise the
packaging and everything.

57:54.538 --> 57:55.671
What about the stone?

57:55.773 --> 57:57.639
There was a stone?
A gem?

57:57.741 --> 57:59.641
Ice cold.
Stop talking.

57:59.743 --> 58:02.477
A rock.
It was a rock from Greece.

58:02.580 --> 58:05.414
It was the first trip that I
ever took overseas by myself.

58:06.550 --> 58:08.750
I never felt
so free.

58:08.853 --> 58:11.220
I was just
thinking, no joke.

58:11.322 --> 58:12.688
Greek salad
for the reception.

58:13.824 --> 58:15.858
Is there any

58:15.960 --> 58:18.927
Obviously the candles,
because you're romantic?

58:19.029 --> 58:21.897
Well, I love to travel
and I get homesick.

58:21.999 --> 58:24.867
And I found that, by lighting
a candle from home,

58:24.969 --> 58:27.202
I could make any hotel room
feel like home.

58:27.304 --> 58:30.706
So I pack one, but I
always forget matches.

58:30.808 --> 58:33.308
Speaking of matches.

58:34.378 --> 58:35.911
And flames, and heat.

58:36.013 --> 58:37.880
You need
to check the kitchen?

58:37.982 --> 58:39.848
No, I think
I've got it from here.

58:43.687 --> 58:45.621
You know if you two get married,

58:45.723 --> 58:48.257
he and I will see each other
a lot over the years.

58:48.359 --> 58:49.791
He's going to figure
it out someday.

58:49.894 --> 58:51.460
I don't think so.

58:51.562 --> 58:53.562
-What?
-Nothing. Focus.

58:59.904 --> 59:01.370
No? You want some?

59:01.472 --> 59:03.805
Yeah.

59:03.908 --> 59:05.140
It's good, right?

59:05.242 --> 59:06.842
Told you.

59:09.813 --> 59:11.880
Like...

59:11.982 --> 59:13.415
What? I have
something on my face?

59:13.517 --> 59:14.483
Where?

59:14.585 --> 59:16.084
A little.

59:39.343 --> 59:40.642
Down a little.

59:46.450 --> 59:49.084
Up.
Up all the way.

59:49.186 --> 59:50.519
Up a little.

59:50.621 --> 59:51.853
Like this?

01:00:02.199 --> 01:00:04.166
I noticed a lot of your
sketches were from here.

01:00:05.836 --> 01:00:07.336
How'd you know
it was my favorite spot?

01:00:08.739 --> 01:00:10.472
It is?

01:00:10.574 --> 01:00:13.041
Good... guess, I guess.

01:00:17.047 --> 01:00:18.880
Angie, what does Greece
make you think of?

01:00:21.819 --> 01:00:23.719
Mythology.

01:00:23.821 --> 01:00:25.454
The ocean.

01:00:25.556 --> 01:00:26.922
Naps in the sun.

01:00:28.492 --> 01:00:30.258
Not that I know
first hand.

01:00:30.361 --> 01:00:31.493
I haven't been there.

01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:36.331
I haven't been anywhere,
actually. Why?

01:00:36.433 --> 01:00:37.733
Why do you ask?

01:00:39.336 --> 01:00:40.602
No reason.

01:00:52.616 --> 01:00:53.949
Are you okay?

01:00:54.051 --> 01:00:56.051
Yeah, no.
I'm fine.

01:00:57.955 --> 01:01:00.288
Just jitters, I guess.

01:01:00.391 --> 01:01:02.090
There's nothing to be
jittery about.

01:01:06.397 --> 01:01:08.263
You know about
my inheritance.

01:01:08.365 --> 01:01:11.767
How I have to be married
in order to claim it.

01:01:11.869 --> 01:01:16.004
That was a clause my parents put
into my trust when I was a toddler.

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:18.340
I could've claimed it
a long time ago,

01:01:18.442 --> 01:01:20.475
but my inheritance isn't
about money for me, it's...

01:01:21.779 --> 01:01:24.479
It's about freedom.

01:01:24.581 --> 01:01:27.749
And I wouldn't exactly be free
if I married the wrong person.

01:01:30.087 --> 01:01:32.287
And you think Candace
is the wrong person?

01:01:34.992 --> 01:01:37.059
I don't know if I was just spell-bound
by the magic of the ball,

01:01:37.161 --> 01:01:39.895
but I certainly felt
like I was in love.

01:01:42.966 --> 01:01:44.399
We're friends, right, Angie?

01:01:47.404 --> 01:01:50.505
Yeah. Yeah,
we're friends.

01:01:50.607 --> 01:01:52.340
So I can trust you.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.480
What if Candace isn't
the woman from the ball?

01:02:01.018 --> 01:02:03.518
Candace has proven
that she is.

01:02:04.955 --> 01:02:07.189
Right. Yes, she has.
She has.

01:02:10.527 --> 01:02:12.260
Maybe I'm just wishing
that she's not,

01:02:12.362 --> 01:02:15.330
so that the problem
wouldn't be with me.

01:02:15.432 --> 01:02:19.267
I mean, the truth is it's entirely
possible that this is just my...

01:02:19.369 --> 01:02:21.503
usual commitment phobia.

01:02:23.774 --> 01:02:24.873
Except...

01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:28.210
Except what?

01:02:28.312 --> 01:02:29.845
I still feel like
I'm in love.

01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:36.318
Just not when
I'm around Candace.

01:02:38.956 --> 01:02:42.891
Nicholas! Where
are you, my turtle dove?

01:02:57.107 --> 01:02:58.907
Candace, there's something
I have to tell you.

01:02:59.009 --> 01:03:01.676
Is it Nicholas' favorite color,
because that's come up a few times?

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:03.011
No.

01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:10.719
Candace, I care about you
and Nicholas, as a friend.

01:03:10.821 --> 01:03:13.522
I know you do,
Angie, I can see that.

01:03:13.624 --> 01:03:17.058
That's why I know how much it will
hurt you to never see him again.

01:03:17.161 --> 01:03:18.260
What do you mean?

01:03:18.362 --> 01:03:19.494
You wanna tell the truth.

01:03:20.531 --> 01:03:21.530
Yes.

01:03:22.833 --> 01:03:25.667
Of course, you do,
because you're you.

01:03:25.769 --> 01:03:29.771
But there's a point of no return,
Angie, and we've passed it.

01:03:29.873 --> 01:03:33.175
Do you really think that Nicholas
will still consider you his friend

01:03:33.277 --> 01:03:36.111
if he found out
what you've done?

01:03:36.213 --> 01:03:39.281
He won't have anything to do with either
of us romantically or platonically.

01:03:39.383 --> 01:03:42.450
Keep our little secret and you
get to keep your new friend.

01:03:43.554 --> 01:03:46.721
And your career,
and your family.

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:50.025
Tell the truth and...
you could lose everything.

01:03:51.328 --> 01:03:52.961
But, it's your choice.

01:04:01.138 --> 01:04:03.538
Who's been naughty
and who's been nice?

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:06.541
What?

01:04:06.643 --> 01:04:08.977
I can wear this to a
Christmas wedding, right?

01:04:09.079 --> 01:04:11.880
Yes. It's perfect.

01:04:12.883 --> 01:04:14.115
For the mall!

01:04:14.218 --> 01:04:16.384
You can't walk me
down the aisle in that?

01:04:16.486 --> 01:04:18.553
This picture cannot go
in a magazine.

01:04:18.655 --> 01:04:20.889
All right. All right.

01:04:20.991 --> 01:04:24.092
I'm just so happy that
both my girls are so happy,

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:26.294
and our family
is getting bigger.

01:04:26.396 --> 01:04:29.130
I've worked my whole life to make
sure that you both have the best.

01:04:29.233 --> 01:04:30.732
And it's all finally
coming together.

01:04:32.436 --> 01:04:34.736
You'll meet the right guy
someday, too, Ang.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:40.175
Santa knows.

01:04:40.277 --> 01:04:42.177
So you go through
these great to find

01:04:42.279 --> 01:04:44.446
this rare woman
and now you want someone else?

01:04:44.548 --> 01:04:45.914
I know what you're thinking.

01:04:46.016 --> 01:04:47.616
This is just
the old Nicholas Carmichael

01:04:47.718 --> 01:04:50.018
being itchy
about commitment,

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:51.853
but maybe it's not.

01:04:51.955 --> 01:04:55.290
I can't be sure of how I'm feeling
until I know for sure if it was

01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:57.259
Candace that I met
at the ball or Angie.

01:04:58.695 --> 01:04:59.961
Or someone else
entirely.

01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:03.765
How're you
going to find out?

01:05:03.867 --> 01:05:05.767
Her stocking.

01:05:05.869 --> 01:05:08.903
There's a line about books and
covers that probably applies here.

01:05:12.209 --> 01:05:15.944
Not especially telling, unless
we dust it for fingerprints.

01:05:16.046 --> 01:05:17.979
Candace has
quoted him.

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:19.547
And so has Angie.

01:05:22.719 --> 01:05:23.885
Not entirely helpful.

01:05:27.391 --> 01:05:28.823
For her sketches.

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:30.659
That again, whittles it down
to Candace or Angie

01:05:30.761 --> 01:05:31.660
instead of a third party.

01:05:31.762 --> 01:05:33.561
All right.

01:05:37.768 --> 01:05:40.035
Do either of them
have pets?

01:05:40.137 --> 01:05:41.303
I don't know.

01:05:41.405 --> 01:05:43.071
Your marriage is off
to a great start.

01:05:43.173 --> 01:05:44.906
Matches!

01:05:45.008 --> 01:05:46.641
The thing that I always
forget to pack!

01:05:46.743 --> 01:05:49.811
See, I'm not crazy. The girl at
the ball is the girl for me.

01:05:49.913 --> 01:05:51.513
And she's either
Candace or Angie.

01:05:52.816 --> 01:05:54.316
Now this I can work with.

01:05:58.588 --> 01:06:01.056
Is this your first time
at Ate-y Days?

01:06:01.158 --> 01:06:03.525
Bueno! Well, we are
an international restaurant,

01:06:03.627 --> 01:06:06.194
featuring a constantly revolving
menu of dishes from other countries.

01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:08.263
No American food here.

01:06:08.365 --> 01:06:10.365
Our holiday special
is Hungarian goulash,

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:12.901
and Danish Aebleskiver
for dessert. Sample?

01:06:13.003 --> 01:06:17.072
So what did we learn from that besides Ate-y
Days is the best place in town for goulash?

01:06:17.174 --> 01:06:21.776
I don't know. But it doesn't seem like the
kind of place that Candace would ever go.

01:06:21.878 --> 01:06:24.279
It seems like more of a place
for a woman who...

01:06:25.649 --> 01:06:27.215
longs to travel.

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:28.383
Nicholas, where are you going?

01:06:37.027 --> 01:06:38.860
-Hey, Zelda.
-Max!

01:06:38.962 --> 01:06:40.261
You two know each other?

01:06:40.364 --> 01:06:42.097
Yeah, we've been using her
for tailoring for years.

01:06:42.199 --> 01:06:43.231
She was at the ball.

01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:44.866
So was that dress
in the window.

01:06:44.968 --> 01:06:45.967
Could you tell me
who bought it

01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:47.102
and what
it's doing back here?

01:06:47.204 --> 01:06:49.270
Long story.
Why do you ask?

01:06:49.373 --> 01:06:51.272
Well...

01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:53.141
The woman who bought it
said it wasn't for her.

01:06:53.243 --> 01:06:56.811
But I ran into her at the ball right
after midnight as she was leaving,

01:06:56.913 --> 01:06:58.713
and she was indeed
wearing it.

01:06:58.815 --> 01:07:00.148
And then she returned it?

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:02.784
No, three days later a
different woman returned it...

01:07:02.886 --> 01:07:03.985
claiming it didn't fit.

01:07:04.087 --> 01:07:07.655
I gave her a full refund
to stop the yelling.

01:07:07.758 --> 01:07:10.325
And also because I do have a
soft spot for this dress.

01:07:10.427 --> 01:07:12.494
Do you know where we can find
either of these two women?

01:07:12.596 --> 01:07:15.463
Well, the one who returned it
should be easy enough to find.

01:07:15.565 --> 01:07:16.765
You're engaged to her.

01:07:18.168 --> 01:07:20.969
I thought I might be.
And the other?

01:07:21.071 --> 01:07:23.772
Well, all I know is that
she visits her parents

01:07:23.874 --> 01:07:25.740
at the cemetery,
down the street.

01:07:27.010 --> 01:07:28.209
Angie.

01:07:30.447 --> 01:07:32.847
I'd like to buy this dress
from you, if I could.

01:07:47.297 --> 01:07:48.530
Where are you going now?

01:07:48.632 --> 01:07:51.132
To have a little chat
with my fiancée.

01:08:00.744 --> 01:08:02.010
Baby cakes!

01:08:02.112 --> 01:08:03.778
Is this a bad time?

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:05.013
I do wish you would've called

01:08:05.115 --> 01:08:06.448
so I could've gotten
myself ready first.

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:08.249
I'll bet. Can I come in?

01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:17.158
I might have some left-over beefy
puffs in the fridge... -No thanks.

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:18.993
Please. Have a seat.

01:08:23.667 --> 01:08:27.234
You never told me the meaning
of the items in your stocking.

01:08:27.337 --> 01:08:28.670
I'd love to hear.

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:33.475
I just remembered I have a
quick phone call to make.

01:08:33.577 --> 01:08:35.276
-If you'll excuse me.
-To Angie?

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:38.345
Why would you think that?

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:39.948
Just take a look inside.

01:08:45.822 --> 01:08:48.823
Of course,
my ferret.

01:08:50.193 --> 01:08:51.658
Juicy.

01:08:51.761 --> 01:08:53.261
It's a bunny.

01:08:53.363 --> 01:08:55.563
-Is it here in the house?
-No!

01:08:55.665 --> 01:08:57.465
It's dead.

01:08:58.635 --> 01:09:00.100
Really miss it.

01:09:00.203 --> 01:09:04.706
Is it buried in the same cemetery
that this rose came from?

01:09:04.808 --> 01:09:08.243
From the same cemetery where
Angie's parents are buried?

01:09:08.345 --> 01:09:09.844
You mean my aunt and uncle?

01:09:09.946 --> 01:09:11.779
I was close with them, too,
you know?

01:09:17.053 --> 01:09:18.219
For lighting candles.

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:20.188
You ever been
to that restaurant?

01:09:20.290 --> 01:09:22.823
I must have. Once.

01:09:26.029 --> 01:09:29.397
Could you give me
a quote by Oscar Wilde?

01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:32.734
Really putting me
on the spot here.

01:09:32.836 --> 01:09:35.670
Would you give me
a quote by anyone?

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:40.008
"Quotes are for nerds."
Candace Carrillo.

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:45.479
Joking. Obviously.

01:09:45.582 --> 01:09:48.816
I had an idea for an ice
sculpture for the reception.

01:09:48.885 --> 01:09:51.419
Would you sketch it for me?

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.154
I...

01:09:56.259 --> 01:09:58.760
Okay. You got me.

01:09:58.862 --> 01:10:02.497
I was so busy getting ready
for your ball that I...

01:10:02.599 --> 01:10:05.633
delegated the filling
of the stocking to Angie.

01:10:05.735 --> 01:10:07.802
So she chose
these things.

01:10:07.904 --> 01:10:11.172
I'm sorry. But it really was
me that you met at the ball.

01:10:13.443 --> 01:10:16.611
Why did you return the dress?

01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:20.782
I... must've still been under
the hazy spell of the ball

01:10:20.884 --> 01:10:23.017
because I don't even
remember doing that.

01:10:23.119 --> 01:10:25.587
Thank you so much for
getting it back for me.

01:10:29.859 --> 01:10:31.993
Would you try
it on for me?

01:10:32.095 --> 01:10:33.461
I would love to see you
in it again.

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:51.546
Beautiful.

01:10:59.923 --> 01:11:01.222
Can you turn around for me?

01:11:01.324 --> 01:11:04.459
This dress really is
much better from the front.

01:11:06.162 --> 01:11:07.729
It really is a magical ensemble.

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:15.903
I've been stress eating.

01:11:17.307 --> 01:11:19.540
What about my stocking?
Do you have it here?

01:11:19.643 --> 01:11:23.044
I didn't know that we were
supposed to keep those.

01:11:23.146 --> 01:11:26.147
You threw out
my childhood stocking?

01:11:26.249 --> 01:11:29.751
As a symbol of putting
childish things behind you.

01:11:29.853 --> 01:11:33.988
Candace, isn't it time that we both admitted
it was Angie that I met at the ball?

01:11:34.090 --> 01:11:35.490
How can you say that?

01:11:37.027 --> 01:11:40.595
Look, I know I haven't
been myself lately,

01:11:40.697 --> 01:11:44.866
but I don't think you understand the amount
of stress that a wedding puts on a bride.

01:11:44.968 --> 01:11:49.604
They usually get a year to plan.
I've got two weeks.

01:11:49.706 --> 01:11:54.108
I was taking a leap of faith based on
that magical night that we shared,

01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:57.111
and I thought you were
doing the same for me.

01:11:57.213 --> 01:11:59.580
But if your accusations
are correct...

01:11:59.683 --> 01:12:01.549
and I'm not saying they are...

01:12:03.486 --> 01:12:06.154
Angie is helping you plan
your wedding to someone else.

01:12:08.291 --> 01:12:09.557
She doesn't love you.

01:12:11.561 --> 01:12:12.860
I do!

01:12:34.217 --> 01:12:35.516
Hey.

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:38.553
Do you think I should
get married tomorrow?

01:12:39.923 --> 01:12:42.223
Speak now or forever
hold your peace.

01:12:42.325 --> 01:12:44.625
What does it matter
what I think?

01:12:44.728 --> 01:12:46.094
I like you.

01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:49.831
Yeah. I like you, too.

01:12:52.602 --> 01:12:53.701
But you don't love me.

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:58.039
That's an odd question.

01:13:00.577 --> 01:13:01.576
Do you love me?

01:13:04.781 --> 01:13:06.280
I don't know
if I can trust you.

01:13:08.218 --> 01:13:09.851
I don't know whether I can
trust you either.

01:13:09.953 --> 01:13:13.454
Me? What have I
ever done to you?

01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:16.657
Not me, but the tabloids are filled
with your past relationships,

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.693
and they don't exactly
have happy endings.

01:13:18.795 --> 01:13:21.362
Okay, but the question is whether you
think that my past relationships

01:13:21.464 --> 01:13:23.965
are based on who I am
or who I was with.

01:13:24.067 --> 01:13:27.034
If you think it's who I am, then
sure, I would be the same with you,

01:13:27.137 --> 01:13:28.836
but if you think
it was who I was with,

01:13:28.938 --> 01:13:31.172
well, then,
my past is irrelevant.

01:13:31.274 --> 01:13:33.975
I would be different
with you because...

01:13:34.077 --> 01:13:35.476
because you're different.

01:13:37.247 --> 01:13:38.846
But maybe you're not different.

01:13:38.948 --> 01:13:41.382
Maybe you've been lying to me
this entire time to make sure

01:13:41.484 --> 01:13:45.019
that someone in your family
gets my inheritance.

01:13:45.121 --> 01:13:47.655
Accusing me of gold-digging isn't
going to get me to open up.

01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:48.990
Well, then what is?

01:13:49.092 --> 01:13:50.992
-Knowing what you want!
-I know what I want.

01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:54.362
If you did, you would not be
standing here talking to me

01:13:54.464 --> 01:13:57.398
when you have a wedding scheduled
to somebody else tomorrow.

01:14:11.314 --> 01:14:13.347
When I lost you...

01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:15.449
I tried to be grateful
for whatever I had.

01:14:18.955 --> 01:14:20.822
'Cause I knew how easily
I could lose it.

01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:25.493
I was so close to getting
everything I thought that I wanted.

01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:29.697
That night at the ball
with Nicholas was...

01:14:32.001 --> 01:14:33.034
so much more.

01:14:37.841 --> 01:14:39.607
But I was too scared
to accept it.

01:14:42.445 --> 01:14:44.312
And now I've lost
everything.

01:14:47.217 --> 01:14:50.284
Regardless of what happens,
I can't do this to Nicholas.

01:14:52.722 --> 01:14:54.021
Love you.

01:14:57.627 --> 01:15:00.294
Candace, you make
a lovely bride.

01:15:00.396 --> 01:15:02.063
I know.
Thank you.

01:15:02.165 --> 01:15:04.065
It's almost time.
Have you seen Nicholas?

01:15:04.167 --> 01:15:06.133
No, but I wouldn't worry.

01:15:06.236 --> 01:15:08.736
He'll be here. We're not allowed to
see each other on our wedding day.

01:15:10.273 --> 01:15:13.307
My son has put his heart
into this. Into you.

01:15:13.409 --> 01:15:16.711
I didn't believe it at first,
but he's changed,

01:15:16.813 --> 01:15:19.347
he's becoming the man
he was meant to be.

01:15:20.483 --> 01:15:22.683
And that must be
because of you.

01:15:24.754 --> 01:15:26.087
So welcome to the family.

01:15:27.657 --> 01:15:29.423
Well, better get back
to the guests.

01:15:34.797 --> 01:15:35.897
Where have you been?

01:15:35.999 --> 01:15:37.865
You've, like, never ever
been late before.

01:15:37.967 --> 01:15:40.001
Get over here and help me
with this stupid microphone.

01:15:40.103 --> 01:15:42.670
No, Candace.

01:15:42.772 --> 01:15:47.408
I'm sorry to ruin your wedding
day, but this is not right.

01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:49.043
The ceremony's set
to start in 20 minutes.

01:15:51.214 --> 01:15:53.014
I really thought if I didn't
cancel this wedding,

01:15:53.116 --> 01:15:54.949
then Angie would be
forced to tell me the truth.

01:15:56.452 --> 01:15:58.786
But she's really
going to let me marry Candace.

01:16:03.059 --> 01:16:04.392
She doesn't love me.

01:16:06.996 --> 01:16:08.529
Well, that finally answers that.

01:16:10.033 --> 01:16:11.032
You want me to handle it?

01:16:12.368 --> 01:16:14.402
No.

01:16:14.504 --> 01:16:16.370
No, I will take care
of this myself.

01:16:18.708 --> 01:16:20.942
-I need you to turn the mic on.
-Hurry. Hurry.

01:16:21.044 --> 01:16:23.878
Nobody wants
Nicholas to marry an impostor.

01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:26.580
You may have been the one at the ball,
but I'm the one at the wedding.

01:16:26.683 --> 01:16:28.416
This isn't about
who he ends up with.

01:16:28.518 --> 01:16:31.652
This is about
who I am.

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:34.422
I'm done being the person that
doesn't stick up for themselves.

01:16:34.524 --> 01:16:37.458
I'm done being the person
that doesn't say how they feel

01:16:37.527 --> 01:16:40.828
or what they really want out of
fear of losing what they hold dear.

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:42.630
I'm hurting others, too.

01:16:42.699 --> 01:16:45.433
Nicholas now doesn't
believe in love anymore.

01:16:45.535 --> 01:16:48.903
I have let your dad be proud thinking
you're this hard-working entrepreneur,

01:16:49.005 --> 01:16:51.939
not realizing you have bullied
and blackmailed me

01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:55.009
into doing everything for you.

01:16:55.111 --> 01:16:58.980
And what's worse, I let it be okay
that you can get anything you want

01:16:59.082 --> 01:17:01.148
without deserving a thing,

01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:02.917
including marrying someone
who doesn't love you

01:17:03.019 --> 01:17:04.585
or you don't love either.

01:17:05.888 --> 01:17:06.954
Is that it?

01:17:08.491 --> 01:17:10.958
No. Also...

01:17:12.128 --> 01:17:13.194
I quit.

01:17:14.597 --> 01:17:17.164
Well, we obviously
need some time apart.

01:17:17.266 --> 01:17:19.033
You can leave now.

01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:22.269
Sure. Right after
I've spoken to Nicholas.

01:17:22.372 --> 01:17:23.671
No.

01:17:23.773 --> 01:17:26.607
Get! Candace, get...

01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:29.010
Candace, no! Candace!

01:17:29.112 --> 01:17:31.345
Open up! -Not until
I marry my Nicholas!

01:17:31.447 --> 01:17:33.447
Yes?

01:17:33.549 --> 01:17:36.951
It's bad luck for you to
see me in my dress on our wedding day.

01:17:37.053 --> 01:17:39.053
Well, didn't you
just call my name?

01:17:39.155 --> 01:17:41.989
Yes, I was practicing.

01:17:42.091 --> 01:17:43.457
You're not dressed?

01:17:43.559 --> 01:17:45.593
I wanted to talk to you
about your wedding gift.

01:17:46.729 --> 01:17:47.828
Go on.

01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:49.697
I've decided to decline
my inheritance.

01:17:49.799 --> 01:17:52.833
I want to prove to you
and anyone else who doubts us

01:17:52.935 --> 01:17:54.568
that I'm not getting
married for money.

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:57.405
I just can't have people
thinking that of you.

01:17:59.008 --> 01:18:00.808
You know what
everyone's going to think?

01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:03.177
That's a terrible gift.

01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:04.879
I wouldn't want anyone
thinking that of you.

01:18:04.981 --> 01:18:07.515
My inheritance is just
this estate,

01:18:07.617 --> 01:18:10.985
a few other properties, company stocks
and vehicles and a whole lot of money,

01:18:11.087 --> 01:18:12.753
but I'll still have my job.

01:18:12.855 --> 01:18:16.090
We can be normal.
We can be anyone we want!

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:18.325
I don't want to be normal.

01:18:18.428 --> 01:18:20.895
Can I exchange my wedding gift
for something I like better?

01:18:20.997 --> 01:18:24.598
No.
I'm sorry, Candace...

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:27.868
but, this wedding is off.

01:18:29.439 --> 01:18:31.672
Good luck with
your future endeavors.

01:18:31.774 --> 01:18:33.274
Wait... What?

01:18:36.012 --> 01:18:38.679
Candace, sweetie.

01:18:38.781 --> 01:18:41.315
Just popped in to tell you
your microphone is on.

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:46.353
Yes.

01:18:46.456 --> 01:18:51.559
In fact, all of the guests
outside heard your conversation.

01:18:52.662 --> 01:18:54.995
Both your conversations.

01:19:02.004 --> 01:19:03.404
Candace, open the door!

01:19:05.908 --> 01:19:07.408
Where is he?
Where's Nicholas?

01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:09.310
He's already gone! He said
something about getting away.

01:19:09.412 --> 01:19:11.312
-What?
-I'm sorry.

01:19:14.817 --> 01:19:16.550
Excuse me.

01:19:16.652 --> 01:19:19.620
I still think I'm the one
having the worst day here.

01:19:19.722 --> 01:19:21.055
God!

01:19:22.825 --> 01:19:24.024
Candace.

01:19:30.867 --> 01:19:33.934
I thought Max might be
lying for you.

01:19:34.036 --> 01:19:36.770
But were you lying? About
giving up your inheritance?

01:19:36.873 --> 01:19:38.472
Can we please talk about
this later, Mother?

01:19:38.574 --> 01:19:40.074
I have a lot on
my mind right now.

01:19:40.176 --> 01:19:41.675
That is why I'm here, Nicholas.

01:19:43.079 --> 01:19:45.679
I'm going to sign your
inheritance over to you.

01:19:49.552 --> 01:19:52.019
But I didn't get married.

01:19:52.121 --> 01:19:55.122
And you don't have to.

01:19:55.224 --> 01:19:56.824
Your decision today
not to get married

01:19:56.926 --> 01:19:58.526
showed very
good judgment.

01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:02.730
So you don't think
it was just commitment phobia?

01:20:04.834 --> 01:20:08.769
Not after learning that Candace
wasn't who she said she was.

01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:14.408
Which is a bit of a relief, actually.

01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:16.143
And not after learning
that her cousin

01:20:16.245 --> 01:20:18.279
is really the one you
fell in love with at the ball.

01:20:20.316 --> 01:20:23.250
That girl... is special.

01:20:26.088 --> 01:20:27.354
But she didn't
tell me the truth.

01:20:28.991 --> 01:20:30.157
She doesn't love me.

01:20:31.494 --> 01:20:33.360
Well...

01:20:33.462 --> 01:20:36.163
if you haven't told her
that you love her...

01:20:37.934 --> 01:20:39.767
you haven't been
honest either.

01:20:55.952 --> 01:20:58.352
If you'll excuse me, I just
want to be left alone.

01:20:58.454 --> 01:21:01.388
Candace has
something she wants to tell you.

01:21:02.425 --> 01:21:04.024
Candace?

01:21:04.126 --> 01:21:05.593
Tell Angie what
you told me.

01:21:11.567 --> 01:21:14.835
I guess I just always felt like
my dad loved you more than me

01:21:14.937 --> 01:21:17.371
because you're both
such hard workers.

01:21:17.473 --> 01:21:19.640
Sometimes I even felt like
he would prefer it

01:21:19.742 --> 01:21:21.308
if you were
his real daughter.

01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:23.277
And us being equals
was unfair to me.

01:21:24.614 --> 01:21:27.414
I just wanted to achieve
something for myself

01:21:27.516 --> 01:21:29.984
and I thought that becoming
a Carmichael would be so big

01:21:30.052 --> 01:21:31.585
that he'd have to be
proud of me.

01:21:31.687 --> 01:21:36.423
Just be yourself, honey,
and I will be.

01:21:36.525 --> 01:21:39.627
And you will be, too.

01:21:39.729 --> 01:21:43.931
And I'm sorry that in trying to make
things equal, I made them unfair.

01:21:44.033 --> 01:21:45.633
And I'm sorry for being
a father-figure

01:21:45.735 --> 01:21:47.701
that neither one of you
feels you can confide in.

01:21:52.074 --> 01:21:53.507
I'm so sorry, Angie.

01:21:56.012 --> 01:21:59.113
The event planning business
is yours, obviously.

01:22:00.116 --> 01:22:01.282
You've earned it.

01:22:08.257 --> 01:22:09.390
Thank you.

01:22:18.267 --> 01:22:19.433
Come on, Candace.

01:22:19.535 --> 01:22:21.101
Let's leave them
some privacy.

01:22:21.203 --> 01:22:22.603
Them?

01:22:22.705 --> 01:22:24.104
Go get him.

01:22:32.715 --> 01:22:34.315
I thought you got away.

01:22:34.417 --> 01:22:36.050
That was a lie.

01:22:36.152 --> 01:22:40.454
Though, in my defense, I thought
you didn't want to see me.

01:22:40.556 --> 01:22:42.556
I didn't realize that you were
just locked outside.

01:22:47.063 --> 01:22:48.562
I'm so sorry.

01:22:51.133 --> 01:22:52.166
I was hurt.

01:22:53.436 --> 01:22:54.635
Mad.

01:22:56.305 --> 01:22:58.205
I shouldn't have lied to you.

01:22:58.307 --> 01:22:59.673
And I wanted
to tell you the truth,

01:22:59.775 --> 01:23:01.508
but I thought you
wouldn't want to see me again.

01:23:03.112 --> 01:23:05.279
I was hoping that you'd
figure it out for yourself.

01:23:06.615 --> 01:23:07.915
I did.

01:23:09.018 --> 01:23:10.150
Just a little late.

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:15.489
I was kinda hoping that you would
tell the truth on your own.

01:23:16.525 --> 01:23:17.591
I did...

01:23:18.594 --> 01:23:22.029
just a little... late.

01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:25.766
I guess we can both
work on our timing.

01:23:29.105 --> 01:23:31.872
I'm glad somebody
put those to good use.

01:23:37.813 --> 01:23:40.981
Angie, you know, the women in those
magazines only wanted my money.

01:23:42.485 --> 01:23:44.718
And so I never had to wonder
how the rest of me stacked up.

01:23:46.889 --> 01:23:48.889
When I met someone
who didn't want my money...

01:23:51.227 --> 01:23:52.793
I wasn't sure
if she'd want me.

01:23:55.131 --> 01:23:56.163
You were insecure?

01:23:57.299 --> 01:23:58.699
You remember that
day in the study?

01:24:00.169 --> 01:24:01.869
Well, you said it...

01:24:03.639 --> 01:24:05.406
"What if she doesn't
want to marry you?"

01:24:05.508 --> 01:24:07.875
It gave me pause.

01:24:07.977 --> 01:24:10.277
Of all the things for you
to remember.

01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:14.782
How could I forget? That was the
first day that I saw the real you.

01:24:14.884 --> 01:24:17.050
You were a business
woman that day.

01:24:17.153 --> 01:24:19.853
A scullery maid the next.

01:24:19.922 --> 01:24:23.424
A close friend
the week after.

01:24:23.526 --> 01:24:26.059
And my show-stopping
soul mate at the ball.

01:24:27.663 --> 01:24:29.530
I didn't know if a woman
like you would have me.

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:34.168
I never thought a man
like you would want me.

01:24:34.270 --> 01:24:36.703
Then I guess we have more
in common than we thought.

01:24:38.007 --> 01:24:39.473
We're both kind...

01:24:39.575 --> 01:24:41.141
understanding...

01:24:41.243 --> 01:24:43.177
creative, intelligent...

01:24:43.279 --> 01:24:44.645
terribly humble.

01:24:44.747 --> 01:24:46.013
We both love me.

01:24:50.853 --> 01:24:52.386
I don't know
if you love me, Angie...

01:24:54.457 --> 01:24:55.856
but I love you.

01:24:56.959 --> 01:24:58.091
Yes.

01:24:59.929 --> 01:25:01.261
Yes, I love you.

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:06.366
Well, then, go take
a look in that stocking.

01:25:27.490 --> 01:25:28.989
Angie, will you marry me?

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:33.160
Yes.

01:25:34.563 --> 01:25:35.896
Yes!
