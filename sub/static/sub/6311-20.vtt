WEBVTT

00:04.656 --> 00:05.657
Mom!

00:05.744 --> 00:06.876
BONNIE:
What?

00:06.963 --> 00:07.964
Come here.

00:08.051 --> 00:08.965
Why?

00:09.052 --> 00:10.880
Just come down.

00:18.714 --> 00:20.063
Mom!
[whispers]:
Hey.

00:20.150 --> 00:21.673
[yells]

00:21.760 --> 00:24.676
Ooh, you're so jumpy.

00:24.763 --> 00:26.243
Come sit next to me.

00:26.330 --> 00:27.984
What's up?
Hold my hand.

00:28.071 --> 00:29.464
Okay. What's going on?

00:29.551 --> 00:30.726
Don't talk, just hold.

00:33.207 --> 00:36.036
You have really tiny hands.

00:36.123 --> 00:38.951
Feel like I'm going steady
with a raccoon.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.649
Shh!

00:40.736 --> 00:42.694
Can you at least tell me
what we're looking at here?

00:42.781 --> 00:44.131
My grades get posted at noon,

00:44.218 --> 00:46.002
and I don't want to
look at them by myself.

00:46.089 --> 00:47.612
Oh, so you think you blew it?

00:47.699 --> 00:49.658
No! Why would you say that?

00:49.745 --> 00:50.920
[spits three times]

00:51.007 --> 00:52.182
Take it back!

00:52.269 --> 00:55.881
[mimics spitting]

00:55.968 --> 00:57.274
When did we become gypsies?

00:57.361 --> 00:59.146
I just don't want to jinx it.

00:59.233 --> 01:02.018
Well, that's not possible now
that you spit three times.

01:02.105 --> 01:04.194
Can you please just sit here
and support me?

01:04.281 --> 01:06.327
I honestly thought
that's what I was doing.

01:06.414 --> 01:08.981
Okay, I'm just gonna be quiet.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.201
Sorry, it was just
such a tough semester,

01:11.288 --> 01:13.682
with work, and Roscoe,
and Violet,

01:13.769 --> 01:15.684
and crazy stuff around here.

01:15.771 --> 01:17.077
Am I the crazy stuff?

01:17.164 --> 01:18.556
Yeah.

01:18.643 --> 01:20.906
Also, I turned in
a couple papers late.

01:20.993 --> 01:22.343
I'm pretty sure I screwed up

01:22.430 --> 01:23.518
my literature final
on Metamorphosis.

01:23.605 --> 01:24.562
What's that?

01:24.649 --> 01:25.650
It's an awful book.

01:25.737 --> 01:26.912
A guy wakes up one morning

01:26.999 --> 01:28.566
and is turned
into a giant cockroach.

01:28.653 --> 01:30.742
But not like Spiderman who
got bit by a radioactive spider,

01:30.829 --> 01:32.309
this guy just wakes up
all cockroach-y.

01:34.311 --> 01:35.225
So no super powers?

01:35.312 --> 01:36.574
Nope.

01:36.661 --> 01:37.836
He doesn't fight crime,
no costume,

01:37.923 --> 01:39.751
he's just a bug for no reason.

01:39.838 --> 01:42.711
Can he make other
cockroaches do his bidding?

01:42.798 --> 01:43.886
Doesn't even try.

01:43.973 --> 01:45.061
He just complains.

01:45.148 --> 01:47.890
So what was your paper about?

01:47.977 --> 01:49.196
I wish I remember.

01:49.283 --> 01:50.458
I wrote it when I had
walking pneumonia

01:50.545 --> 01:51.589
and was on all that medication.

01:51.676 --> 01:53.069
Well, there you go.

01:53.156 --> 01:54.810
If you flunk, you can
blame it on drugs,

01:54.897 --> 01:57.073
like when you were
in junior high.

01:57.160 --> 01:59.902
Excuse me, I did not
take drugs in junior high.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.035
I just drank.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.212
Mostly wine coolers.

02:05.299 --> 02:07.170
And cough syrup.

02:07.257 --> 02:08.519
Ooh, they're up, they're up.

02:12.306 --> 02:13.220
Oh, my God.

02:13.307 --> 02:15.265
Are we reading this right?

02:15.352 --> 02:16.875
I got straight A's.

02:16.962 --> 02:18.921
That's why I asked,
"Are we reading this right?"

02:19.008 --> 02:20.009
I got straight A's, Mom!

02:20.096 --> 02:21.402
I got straight A's.

02:21.489 --> 02:22.794
Wait, wait, wait,
there's an asterisk.

02:22.881 --> 02:23.839
What does that mean?

02:23.926 --> 02:25.188
Were you using steroids?

02:25.275 --> 02:26.189
Let me look.

02:29.192 --> 02:30.411
I made the dean's list.

02:30.498 --> 02:33.762
Oh, honey, did you
sleep with the dean?

02:33.849 --> 02:36.068
I didn't have to,

02:36.156 --> 02:37.287
I'm smart!

02:39.115 --> 02:41.030
â™ª

02:56.524 --> 02:57.916
Congratulations, sweetie.

02:58.003 --> 02:59.179
The dean's list is a big deal.

03:00.310 --> 03:02.443
[muffled]:
Thanks.

03:02.530 --> 03:05.315
I always kind of suspected
I might be, you know,

03:05.402 --> 03:06.577
gifted.

03:10.494 --> 03:12.757
One of the best parts
of staying sober

03:12.844 --> 03:15.499
is learning what
we're really capable of.

03:15.586 --> 03:17.327
You should come to one
of my Mensa meetings.

03:17.414 --> 03:19.068
Wait, you're in Mensa?

03:19.155 --> 03:20.548
What's Mensa?

03:20.635 --> 03:23.246
It's a club for people
with high IQs.

03:23.333 --> 03:24.900
And you're in that?

03:24.987 --> 03:26.554
Yes.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.384
I said "Yes."

03:33.082 --> 03:35.563
So, Christy, have you thought
about what's next for you?

03:35.650 --> 03:38.696
Well, I guess transfer
to a four-year college,

03:38.783 --> 03:41.177
and then, hopefully, law school.

03:41.264 --> 03:43.092
That's wonderful.

03:43.179 --> 03:45.442
I'm sure you'll get
straight A's there, too.

03:45.529 --> 03:47.966
Marjorie, why are you getting
her expectations up?

03:48.053 --> 03:50.317
It's one thing to get good
grades at a community college,

03:50.404 --> 03:52.319
where it's basically everybody
gets an A for showing up

03:52.406 --> 03:54.799
with pants on, zipper forward.

03:54.886 --> 03:57.193
But real college
is different, am I right?

03:57.280 --> 03:58.325
No.

03:58.412 --> 03:59.935
An A is an A,

04:00.022 --> 04:01.719
whether it's
at Napa Valley Tech or Harvard.

04:01.806 --> 04:03.895
Yeah, but if you're
getting brain surgery,

04:03.982 --> 04:06.246
which diploma do you want
to see on your doctor's wall?

04:08.160 --> 04:09.466
My A's are A's.

04:09.553 --> 04:10.815
Don't crap on my A's.

04:10.902 --> 04:12.513
Nobody's crapping.

04:12.600 --> 04:13.949
I'm just trying to inject
a little reality here.

04:14.036 --> 04:14.906
Wendy, you're in Mensa,
tell her.

04:14.993 --> 04:17.692
Um...

04:17.779 --> 04:19.259
we mostly do puzzles.

04:22.218 --> 04:24.307
It doesn't matter.

04:24.394 --> 04:26.353
Christy, you're a totally
different person

04:26.440 --> 04:28.529
than the hot mess
that crawled into that meeting

04:28.616 --> 04:31.096
three years ago,
and I'm so proud of you.

04:31.183 --> 04:32.663
Thanks, Marjorie.

04:32.750 --> 04:33.925
To Christy.

04:34.012 --> 04:35.318
ALL:
To Christy.

04:35.405 --> 04:36.711
We should also
be toasting Wendy

04:36.798 --> 04:38.321
who managed to hide
her intelligence from us

04:38.408 --> 04:39.322
for all these years.

04:39.409 --> 04:42.543
ALL:
To Wendy.

04:45.328 --> 04:47.852
[sighs]
You ready for lights out?

04:47.939 --> 04:49.767
Let me just finish
this text to my daughter.

04:49.854 --> 04:51.682
Oh, good.
You two are talking again?

04:51.769 --> 04:53.162
Yes, we're talking.

04:53.249 --> 04:55.338
Sorry, last I heard
you were dead to her.

04:55.425 --> 04:57.819
Yeah, well, I apologized
for something I didn't do,

04:57.906 --> 05:01.431
and now we're good again.

05:01.518 --> 05:03.825
Wow, and she invited you
to go with her?

05:03.912 --> 05:06.349
That's right,
I am buying the dress.

05:06.436 --> 05:09.134
Oh, well, that explains
why she invited you.

05:09.221 --> 05:13.704
No, she invited me because
our relationship is better now.

05:13.791 --> 05:15.315
You know what?
Let's just go to bed.

05:15.402 --> 05:16.359
Fine.

05:22.452 --> 05:25.586
[sighs heavily]

05:27.283 --> 05:28.893
We're not done, are we?

05:28.980 --> 05:30.634
We need to talk about something.

05:30.721 --> 05:33.594
Oh, no, do you want a divorce?

05:36.205 --> 05:37.859
This is serious.

05:37.946 --> 05:39.295
Earlier with the girls,

05:39.382 --> 05:40.688
all that stuff you were saying

05:40.775 --> 05:42.342
about my grades
not being worth anything,

05:42.429 --> 05:43.691
it hurt my feelings.

05:43.778 --> 05:44.909
Oh, come on.

05:44.996 --> 05:46.041
I was kidding.

05:46.128 --> 05:48.043
Didn't feel like kidding.

05:48.130 --> 05:49.740
Everybody there said
they were happy for me,

05:49.827 --> 05:51.481
proud of me,

05:51.568 --> 05:53.440
even the waitress gave me
a free piece of cheesecake.

05:53.527 --> 05:55.006
All you did was put me down.

05:55.093 --> 05:57.226
For God's sakes,
that was just me kibitzing.

05:57.313 --> 06:00.185
That's what I do, I kibitz.

06:00.272 --> 06:00.969
Yeah, I did.

06:01.056 --> 06:01.883
No, you didn't.

06:01.970 --> 06:02.797
Fine. Christy...

06:02.884 --> 06:03.928
Nope, too late now.

06:04.015 --> 06:06.191
What are you doing?

06:06.278 --> 06:08.237
I can't sleep next to someone
who doesn't value me.

06:08.324 --> 06:09.499
Since when?

06:12.372 --> 06:13.373
See?

06:13.460 --> 06:14.548
Kibitz!

06:18.682 --> 06:19.596
We're not done.

06:19.683 --> 06:21.032
Oh, I think we are.

06:21.119 --> 06:23.034
It was just a few
jokes over coffee.

06:23.121 --> 06:25.602
No, no, you purposely
diminished my achievements.

06:25.689 --> 06:27.561
No, no, I was trying
to get some laughs.

06:27.648 --> 06:29.563
Those women count on me

06:29.650 --> 06:32.087
to brighten up
their drab little lives.

06:32.174 --> 06:33.436
It's not just tonight.

06:33.523 --> 06:34.785
You've always sold me short.

06:34.872 --> 06:36.004
Well...

06:36.091 --> 06:37.571
Don't you dare
make a short joke.

06:37.658 --> 06:38.746
Go away.

06:38.833 --> 06:40.269
Fine, but just so we're clear,

06:40.356 --> 06:41.923
you, right now walking around
breathing air,

06:42.010 --> 06:43.054
that's all thanks to me.

06:43.141 --> 06:44.621
That's your argument?

06:44.708 --> 06:45.840
The fact that
I'm walking and breathing

06:45.927 --> 06:47.232
makes you mother of the year?

06:47.319 --> 06:49.147
Hey, not matter how
tough things were,

06:49.234 --> 06:51.106
I always made sure
you never went without.

06:51.193 --> 06:53.761
You always had a roof over your
head and dinner in your belly.

06:53.848 --> 06:55.458
A panel truck is not a roof

06:55.545 --> 06:57.982
and Red Vines are not dinner!

06:58.069 --> 07:00.724
Wow, so ungrateful.

07:00.811 --> 07:02.378
All right,
you want to get current?

07:02.465 --> 07:04.598
The only reason you were able
to go back to school

07:04.685 --> 07:05.599
is because of me.

07:05.686 --> 07:07.252
How do you figure that?

07:07.339 --> 07:08.819
Whose gambling got us evicted
from the old place?

07:08.906 --> 07:10.778
And whose quick thinking
got us this apartment?

07:10.865 --> 07:12.170
Quick thinking?

07:12.257 --> 07:13.520
You lied to the building owners

07:13.607 --> 07:14.825
that you were
a skilled handyman.

07:14.912 --> 07:17.654
Yes, and one of my skills
is lying.

07:17.741 --> 07:20.135
And while you were waiting
tables or going to class,

07:20.222 --> 07:22.006
who babysat for you
free of charge?

07:22.093 --> 07:24.008
Oh, Grandma, thank you.

07:24.095 --> 07:26.141
Oh, I see, you're just
gonna spin everything.

07:26.228 --> 07:27.708
I am a self-made woman.

07:27.795 --> 07:29.579
My success has nothing to do
with you.

07:29.666 --> 07:31.059
Fine. Deal.

07:31.146 --> 07:32.669
Then I also have nothing
to do with your failure.

07:32.756 --> 07:34.018
All the arrests, the drugs,
the drinking,

07:34.105 --> 07:35.019
that's all on you.

07:35.106 --> 07:36.368
Those are not failures.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.066
Those are obstacles
that I overcame

07:38.153 --> 07:40.503
to make my success
all the more compelling!

07:48.511 --> 07:49.773
"Christy J. Plunkett,

07:49.860 --> 07:51.645
"grade four.

07:51.732 --> 07:55.431
Christy is eager to learn and
shows a great deal of promise."

07:55.518 --> 07:57.215
"Grade five.

07:57.302 --> 07:59.870
"Christy is a joy
to have in class.

07:59.957 --> 08:01.524
She is bright and inquisitive."

08:01.611 --> 08:03.308
"Grade six.

08:03.395 --> 08:06.398
"Christy is the best student
I've ever encountered.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.531
She is going to do
amazing things one day."

08:08.618 --> 08:11.012
You kept your report cards?

08:11.099 --> 08:14.189
I also signed them whenever
you went off on a bender.

08:15.407 --> 08:17.888
I never went off on a bender,

08:17.975 --> 08:19.629
those were three-day weekends

08:19.716 --> 08:22.502
where I tried to find you
a father.

08:24.329 --> 08:26.723
The point is,
even as a little kid,

08:26.810 --> 08:28.508
I showed potential.

08:28.595 --> 08:30.335
And now that I'm living up to
that potential,

08:30.422 --> 08:31.336
you're jealous.

08:31.423 --> 08:33.687
I'm jealous of you?

08:33.774 --> 08:35.078
That's right, you heard me.

08:35.166 --> 08:37.517
Oh, honey, I don't think so.

08:37.604 --> 08:39.953
I'm jealous of
Serena Williams,

08:40.041 --> 08:41.433
Michelle Obama,

08:41.520 --> 08:44.306
that tall Arab chick
that bagged Clooney.

08:46.743 --> 08:48.179
The more I hear you talk,

08:48.266 --> 08:50.617
the more I realize
what a miracle I am.

08:50.704 --> 08:54.055
A miracle that was conceived
at a Foghat concert!

09:00.540 --> 09:03.847
You stormed out
before my rebuttal!

09:03.934 --> 09:06.763
All right, rebut.

09:11.376 --> 09:14.771
I got nothing,
but I can't sleep,

09:14.858 --> 09:16.077
so neither will you.

09:16.164 --> 09:17.557
Oh, no you don't!

09:26.478 --> 09:27.610
Morning.

09:27.697 --> 09:29.090
Morning.

09:35.139 --> 09:36.793
Listen...

09:36.880 --> 09:39.709
last night, I said some things
that were pretty ugly.

09:39.796 --> 09:40.797
Yeah?

09:40.884 --> 09:42.103
I just want you to know

09:42.190 --> 09:43.539
that I stand by all of them.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.413
Cute.

09:50.241 --> 09:53.680
But if you don't mind,
I'm not going to engage

09:53.767 --> 09:56.160
on this level, because
that's just not who I am.

09:56.247 --> 09:59.990
I love that you think
you have levels.

10:00.077 --> 10:01.862
See you later.

10:01.949 --> 10:03.690
I'm taking my daughter out
shopping for a wedding dress.

10:03.777 --> 10:06.606
You know, breaking the cycle
of maternal neglect.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.303
See you there.

10:09.391 --> 10:10.305
What do you mean?

10:10.392 --> 10:11.698
Violet invited me.

10:13.743 --> 10:14.918
What's the matter?

10:15.005 --> 10:17.399
Bitch got your tongue?

10:22.491 --> 10:24.493
Tell me this isn't
perfect on you.

10:24.580 --> 10:26.103
It is beautiful.

10:26.190 --> 10:28.758
Oh, I'm crying already
thinking of you wearing this.

10:28.845 --> 10:30.368
Listen, about the price,

10:30.455 --> 10:32.022
Gregory's mom offered
to take care of it.

10:32.109 --> 10:34.111
Hey, this is my
little girl's wedding.

10:34.198 --> 10:36.026
I am more than capable of buying

10:36.113 --> 10:37.027
her a dress.

10:37.114 --> 10:39.726
Not this one specifically,

10:39.813 --> 10:41.553
but a very nice dress.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.860
All right, why don't
we take a look over here

10:43.947 --> 10:45.862
at the bride-on-a-budget rack.

10:45.949 --> 10:47.342
A lot of attitude

10:47.429 --> 10:49.866
from a middle-aged broad
working retail.

10:49.953 --> 10:51.259
Sorry, I'm late.

10:51.346 --> 10:52.652
Someone hid my keys

10:52.739 --> 10:54.479
but forgot I can see
on top of things.

10:56.177 --> 10:57.613
I'm so glad you're here.

10:57.700 --> 10:58.875
I wouldn't miss
it for the world.

10:58.962 --> 11:00.485
What are we looking at?

11:00.572 --> 11:02.052
Just trying to find something
reasonably priced.

11:02.139 --> 11:03.358
Oh, Christy,

11:03.445 --> 11:04.620
your only
daughter's wedding

11:04.707 --> 11:06.404
is not the time
to go cheap.

11:06.491 --> 11:09.407
You're right, I should spend
the same amount on her

11:09.494 --> 11:10.800
that you spent on me.

11:10.887 --> 11:12.367
Oh, wait, that was nothing.

11:12.454 --> 11:14.238
Because I knew the
marriage wouldn't last.

11:14.325 --> 11:15.892
I don't think
her marriage is gonna last,

11:15.979 --> 11:16.980
but that doesn't stop me.

11:17.067 --> 11:17.894
What?

11:17.981 --> 11:18.895
Not important, honey,

11:18.982 --> 11:19.896
just trying to hurt Grandma.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.376
You know what,

11:21.463 --> 11:22.899
let's try on the expensive one.

11:22.986 --> 11:24.727
Mom, you don't have to.

11:24.814 --> 11:27.338
No, but I want to because
that's what good mothers do.

11:27.425 --> 11:28.252
But the price...

11:28.339 --> 11:29.210
Forget the price,

11:29.297 --> 11:30.341
try it on.

11:30.428 --> 11:32.082
Oh, my God.

11:32.169 --> 11:33.083
Right this way.

11:33.170 --> 11:34.824
Okay, okay.

11:36.652 --> 11:39.002
Thanks a lot.

11:39.089 --> 11:41.657
Now I'm on the hook
for a dress I can't afford.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.180
Oh, don't worry about it,

11:43.267 --> 11:44.965
you're gifted,
you'll figure it out.

11:45.052 --> 11:47.445
Don't you dare ruin this
special day with my daughter.

11:47.532 --> 11:49.143
Oh, I think this special
day will be ruined

11:49.230 --> 11:50.710
when your credit card
gets declined.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.494
That's it, get out.

11:52.581 --> 11:53.408
"Get out"?

11:53.495 --> 11:54.539
You heard me,

11:54.626 --> 11:56.150
turn into a bat and fly away!

11:56.237 --> 11:57.978
Make me.

12:00.763 --> 12:02.417
I didn't think so.

12:02.504 --> 12:04.288
[bellowing]

12:04.375 --> 12:06.116
Get off of me!

12:06.203 --> 12:08.249
What is wrong with you?!

12:08.336 --> 12:10.077
You're what's
wrong with me!

12:10.164 --> 12:11.643
All right, that's it!

12:11.731 --> 12:13.776
Who's got
raccoon hands now?

12:13.863 --> 12:16.300
I swear to God,
I will helicopter you

12:16.387 --> 12:17.432
out of this building!

12:17.519 --> 12:19.739
I am not letting go!

12:19.826 --> 12:21.915
Then I am taking you down!

12:22.002 --> 12:22.959
That's all you've

12:23.046 --> 12:25.048
ever done!

12:25.135 --> 12:26.049
[grunting]

12:26.136 --> 12:27.616
Here comes the bride.

12:29.226 --> 12:30.575
Mom! Grandma!

12:31.925 --> 12:33.927
Oh, honey, you
look beautiful!

12:34.014 --> 12:35.929
[straining]: Really pretty!

12:41.412 --> 12:43.501
Okay, the meeting
is now open for sharing.

12:43.588 --> 12:44.807
Who'd like to start?

12:47.201 --> 12:48.985
So glad I came tonight.

12:49.072 --> 12:49.812
Christy.

12:49.899 --> 12:50.682
Ha!

12:52.249 --> 12:55.296
Hi, my name is Christy,
I'm an alcoholic.

12:55.383 --> 12:56.210
ALL:
Hi, Christy.

12:56.297 --> 12:58.778
Boo.

12:58.865 --> 13:01.215
I'm just gonna
cut straight to it,

13:01.302 --> 13:03.565
we're all a little broken here,
but this one...

13:04.609 --> 13:05.915
...this is pure evil.

13:06.002 --> 13:08.048
Ooh, here we go.

13:08.135 --> 13:11.051
What else do you call
someone who is so threatened

13:11.138 --> 13:13.967
by her own child's success that
she has to crap all over it?

13:14.054 --> 13:14.968
Oh, please.

13:15.055 --> 13:16.621
Wait your turn, evil!

13:17.927 --> 13:20.582
I think that name
might stick.

13:20.669 --> 13:22.279
Well, you know what?

13:22.366 --> 13:25.717
It won't work on me
because I am a sober, sane

13:25.805 --> 13:28.677
and emotionally well-balanced
woman who is on her way

13:28.764 --> 13:30.722
to do great things!

13:33.116 --> 13:35.162
What are you looking at?!

13:37.381 --> 13:39.906
Thank you.

13:39.993 --> 13:41.559
Okay, who'd like...

13:41.646 --> 13:42.734
Hi, Bonnie, alcoholic.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.649
ALL:
Hi, Bonn...
Save it!

13:44.736 --> 13:45.825
I would just
like to say that

13:45.912 --> 13:47.870
evil comes in many shapes

13:47.957 --> 13:49.872
and sizes, including pixie.

13:49.959 --> 13:51.134
You all know me,

13:51.221 --> 13:53.876
you know that I mean well,

13:53.963 --> 13:55.530
that I always come from love.

13:55.617 --> 13:58.054
[all laughing]

14:00.013 --> 14:03.712
Oh, well, I wasn't going
for a joke, but okay.

14:03.799 --> 14:06.758
My point is, I love my daughter,

14:06.846 --> 14:09.065
and there is nothing
I wouldn't do for her.

14:09.152 --> 14:11.894
Except be supportive when
something good happens to me.

14:11.981 --> 14:12.895
Christy, no cross-talk.

14:12.982 --> 14:15.593
Zip it, Mensa.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.031
Not only am I supportive,

14:18.118 --> 14:20.860
I am happy, I am thrilled,

14:20.947 --> 14:22.078
I'm a little jealous...

14:22.165 --> 14:22.862
There it is!

14:22.949 --> 14:24.080
There what is?

14:24.167 --> 14:25.081
You admitted you're jealous!

14:25.168 --> 14:26.387
I did not!

14:26.474 --> 14:27.910
You did!
You all heard it, tell her!

14:27.997 --> 14:29.956
You sure did.

14:31.696 --> 14:33.307
Okay, so, maybe I am.

14:33.394 --> 14:34.308
Happy?

14:34.395 --> 14:35.831
No!

14:35.918 --> 14:37.789
How could you be jealous
of your own daughter?!

14:37.877 --> 14:40.227
I don't know,
I'm a horrible person!

14:40.314 --> 14:41.924
What-what is it
you want to hear?

14:42.011 --> 14:44.100
[whispering]:
Best meeting ever.

14:44.187 --> 14:45.797
I want to hear
that you believe in me,

14:45.885 --> 14:47.756
that you think I could
amount to something.

14:47.843 --> 14:50.280
Of course, you can
amount to something.

14:50.367 --> 14:52.892
Why else do you think
I feel so threatened?

14:58.419 --> 14:59.681
Okay.

15:01.857 --> 15:04.860
Well, then, thank you.

15:08.211 --> 15:11.301
All right, who else
would like to share?

15:11.388 --> 15:13.260
Hi, I'm Jill,
I'm an alcoholic.

15:13.347 --> 15:14.609
ALL:
Hi, Jill.

15:14.696 --> 15:16.480
I just got to say
that these are the moments

15:16.567 --> 15:19.092
that make me wish
my mother wasn't dead.

15:28.623 --> 15:29.841
So, listen, how about

15:29.929 --> 15:32.192
we go dress shopping
again next Sunday?

15:32.279 --> 15:33.889
Yes, Violet,

15:33.976 --> 15:35.847
I know we'll have to go
to a different bridal shop.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.849
Thanks.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.677
Love you, too.

15:39.764 --> 15:40.765
She's cool?

15:40.852 --> 15:42.289
Yeah, she's got this weird

15:42.376 --> 15:43.638
forgiving streak.

15:43.725 --> 15:45.814
I have no idea
where it came from.

15:45.901 --> 15:47.337
Skips a generation.

15:47.424 --> 15:48.643
Really?

15:48.730 --> 15:49.992
You want to do this again?

15:50.079 --> 15:52.995
I'm sorry. Namaste.

15:53.082 --> 15:55.650
You know,
I've been thinking,

15:55.737 --> 15:57.521
maybe what you're doing--
going back to college

15:57.608 --> 15:59.001
and everything--

15:59.088 --> 16:00.568
maybe that can be
an inspiration for me.

16:00.655 --> 16:01.525
How so?

16:01.612 --> 16:02.526
Maybe I'm capable

16:02.613 --> 16:04.093
of doing more in this world

16:04.180 --> 16:06.226
than fixing washing machines
and trapping mice.

16:06.313 --> 16:07.618
I know you are.

16:07.705 --> 16:10.404
The key is figuring
out what that is.

16:10.491 --> 16:13.059
Well, why don't
we narrow it down?

16:13.146 --> 16:14.190
What are you really good at?

16:14.277 --> 16:16.279
Um, let's see.

16:16.366 --> 16:20.066
I'm smart, I'm personable,

16:20.153 --> 16:23.765
I'm... really good at tricking
people into liking me.

16:23.852 --> 16:26.202
That's because
you're a fantastic liar.

16:26.289 --> 16:28.639
Never made a promise
I didn't break.

16:28.726 --> 16:30.859
So true.

16:30.946 --> 16:32.295
I'm still waiting
for those roller skates

16:32.382 --> 16:33.340
for my sixth birthday.

16:33.427 --> 16:34.906
They're on the way.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.518
Don't forget
you're a control freak.

16:37.605 --> 16:39.650
Mm, despite having
no real skills,

16:39.737 --> 16:41.913
I love telling people
what they're doing wrong.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.481
And you have a very healthy ego.

16:44.568 --> 16:47.223
Ah, I may not be much,
but I am all I think about.

16:47.310 --> 16:50.096
So, where does that leave us?

16:50.183 --> 16:51.706
[sighs]

16:51.793 --> 16:53.099
I think it's pretty obvious.

16:54.187 --> 16:56.406
BOTH:
Politics.

16:59.496 --> 17:01.368
["Hail to the Chief" plays]

17:03.065 --> 17:04.327
Morning, Madam President.

17:04.414 --> 17:05.762
Morning, Robert.
How's the country today?

17:05.849 --> 17:07.026
It's still there, ma'am.

17:07.113 --> 17:08.288
Excellent, and the
other countries?

17:08.375 --> 17:09.941
All present
and accounted for.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.638
Great. Where are we on
getting my face on a stamp?

17:11.726 --> 17:12.988
Do you really want people

17:13.075 --> 17:14.337
licking the back
of your head, ma'am?

17:14.424 --> 17:15.772
Good point.
Let's put me on money.

17:15.859 --> 17:17.558
Ah, what denomination
did you have in mind?

17:17.645 --> 17:19.516
I've been sober awhile,
do people still snort coke

17:19.603 --> 17:20.604
with hundred dollar bills?

17:20.691 --> 17:21.648
Yes, I believe they do.

17:21.736 --> 17:22.911
Then there's your answer.

17:22.998 --> 17:23.954
You can use
my Tinder picture.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.348
Ah, the one
with the tube top.

17:25.435 --> 17:27.481
Excellent choice.

17:27.568 --> 17:29.091
By the way,
where are we going?

17:29.178 --> 17:30.484
I don't know,
you're the president,

17:30.571 --> 17:31.572
I was following you.

17:31.659 --> 17:32.790
Oh.

17:32.877 --> 17:34.618
Should we sit
down and talk?

17:34.705 --> 17:37.143
Oh, God, no, conversations
always seem much more

17:37.230 --> 17:38.274
interesting
when you're walking.

17:38.361 --> 17:39.275
Really?

17:39.362 --> 17:40.668
Yes, watch.

17:40.755 --> 17:42.191
Have you given more thought

17:42.278 --> 17:44.367
to your nomination
to the Supreme Court?

17:44.454 --> 17:46.456
You're right, this is boring,
let's keep walking.

17:46.543 --> 17:48.110
So, Supreme Court.

17:48.197 --> 17:49.546
Right.

17:49.633 --> 17:50.939
I guess I'll never
hear the end of it

17:51.026 --> 17:51.809
if I don't nominate
my daughter.

17:51.896 --> 17:52.680
Thanks, Mom.

17:52.767 --> 17:53.507
You're welcome.

17:53.594 --> 17:54.812
Maybe now she'll shut up

17:54.899 --> 17:55.726
about those freaking
roller skates.

17:55.813 --> 17:57.424
Not likely, Ma'am.

18:02.385 --> 18:04.996
That smile scares me.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.650
It should.
