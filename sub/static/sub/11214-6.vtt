WEBVTT

00:42.743 --> 00:45.879
MAN:
Officer Ben Sherman knew that
it was against police policy

00:45.879 --> 00:47.348
to get involved
with a victim.

00:47.348 --> 00:49.950
But he did it anyway.

00:49.950 --> 00:53.087
(humming tune)

01:04.932 --> 01:07.435
Daddy, my car is ready.

01:07.435 --> 01:09.703
Can I have a ride
to the dealer?

01:09.703 --> 01:11.839
If you can wait
one hour, sweetheart.

01:11.839 --> 01:14.542
Fine. I'll be in my room.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.577
Just let me know
when you're ready, okay?
Okay.

01:16.577 --> 01:17.878
(kissing sound)

01:17.878 --> 01:20.581
(humming tune)

01:42.002 --> 01:43.604
Hey!

01:43.604 --> 01:46.140
Hey!

01:50.811 --> 01:52.946
(screaming)

01:52.946 --> 01:56.284
(muffled yelling)

01:57.285 --> 01:59.420
First officer
secures the area,

01:59.420 --> 02:00.721
takes down the
contact information

02:00.721 --> 02:02.790
of every person on the
scene for the detectives.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.259
Remember you're the
gatekeeper, all right?

02:05.259 --> 02:07.495
It's your responsibility
to safeguard the evidence.

02:07.495 --> 02:09.797
I don't care
who the hell it is.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.733
Nobody gets in, unless
they have a legitimate purpose.

02:12.733 --> 02:16.270
O.J. would be on death row if
those guys hadn't fucked it up.

02:16.270 --> 02:18.372
(indistinct radio transmission)

02:21.242 --> 02:23.444
I thought tempered glass
was shatterproof.

02:23.444 --> 02:24.812
Not when you whack it
at full speed.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.079
Check the perimeter.

02:26.079 --> 02:27.648
Find out how
these guys got in.
Sure.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.484
Nobody gets in unless
they have a legitimate purpose.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.752
Go.

02:31.752 --> 02:34.255
I was downstairs.
They taped me up.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.289
I was terrified.

02:35.289 --> 02:36.624
Daisy was upstairs.

02:36.624 --> 02:38.492
I... I... I had no idea
what was happening.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.060
Does your
insurance company

02:40.060 --> 02:42.596
have the serial numbers and
photos on all the jewelry?

02:42.596 --> 02:44.198
Most of it.

02:44.198 --> 02:46.267
Honey, I'm just so happy

02:46.267 --> 02:47.768
that you're all right.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.603
You always keep
your garage door open?

02:49.603 --> 02:50.671
What?

02:50.671 --> 02:52.706
Your garage?

02:52.706 --> 02:54.575
Oh, I usually
remember.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.744
All the windows
and doors are secure.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.379
Probably came right in
through the garage

02:58.379 --> 03:00.514
and entered the house
through the laundry room.

03:00.514 --> 03:04.117
Going to need the contact
information and the numbers
on your security company.

03:04.117 --> 03:05.386
Also your insurance agent.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.887
Daisy can get you
anything you need.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.155
No, I'm going with you.

03:08.155 --> 03:09.757
No, no, no, honey,
you stay here.

03:09.757 --> 03:13.861
I need you to stay here and take
care of things, okay? Thank you.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.696
(chuckles)

03:23.904 --> 03:25.673
(pager chirping)

03:25.673 --> 03:26.740
Let it go.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.310
No, I got to answer it.
Let it go.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.779
No, no, no, no.
I have to answer it.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.755
I got to go.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.893
Is it your mother?

03:45.893 --> 03:46.827
Is she okay?

03:46.827 --> 03:47.995
It's work.

03:49.330 --> 03:52.199
Can you help
me out with this?

03:52.199 --> 03:56.136
Another excuse to put
your hands on me.

03:56.136 --> 03:58.606
There you go.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.608
(sighs)

04:02.109 --> 04:07.681
I swear Bel Air must have a
direct line to the police chief.

04:07.681 --> 04:11.785
Security company numbers,
gardeners, maids, handymen.

04:11.785 --> 04:14.822
Anybody who may have
had access to the house.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.524
Oh.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.594
Ben.

04:22.830 --> 04:25.265
Daisy, hey.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.736
This is... this is so weird.

04:28.736 --> 04:31.271
That... that...
Why are you here?

04:31.271 --> 04:33.140
I'm really glad
that it's you,

04:33.140 --> 04:35.075
but this is...

04:35.075 --> 04:36.710
You're a cop?

04:36.710 --> 04:38.979
Yeah.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.948
It's like...

04:40.948 --> 04:42.983
You okay?
You okay?

04:42.983 --> 04:44.585
Um...

04:44.585 --> 04:47.455
This is--
this is crazy.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.724
I mean, I thought
New York was scary.

04:50.724 --> 04:53.394
Um, did you--
did you move to New York?

04:53.394 --> 04:55.295
Yeah.
Really?

04:55.295 --> 04:56.764
Five years ago.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.231
My mom wanted
to move there

04:58.231 --> 05:00.067
when she and my
dad split up.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.335
I noticed you weren't around.

05:01.335 --> 05:04.137
You did?

05:04.137 --> 05:05.138
You, uh...

05:05.138 --> 05:06.407
(chuckles)

05:06.407 --> 05:07.675
You talk to Jenna?

05:07.675 --> 05:08.942
Um, no.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.210
No?

05:10.210 --> 05:12.446
Turns out we didn't
have so much in common.

05:12.446 --> 05:13.914
Me neither.

05:13.914 --> 05:16.717
It took you long enough
to figure that one out.

05:16.717 --> 05:19.052
What can I say, I'm loyal.

05:29.029 --> 05:31.098
Another home invasion.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.332
The suspects hit the place

05:32.332 --> 05:34.001
when the father and
daughter were at home.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.235
Pretty ballsy.

05:35.235 --> 05:36.637
Any serious injuries?

05:36.637 --> 05:39.039
Nothing life-threatening.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.474
What's the problem?

05:40.474 --> 05:42.610
Well, you called us in
on our day off.

05:42.610 --> 05:45.379
I just kind of figured
it must have been a homicide.

05:45.379 --> 05:47.180
That's what we're
trying to avoid.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.683
We got to catch these guys
before things get out of hand.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.920
So we can't get overtime
to work homicide cases,

05:52.920 --> 05:56.524
but now suddenly there's money
to fund Bel Air break-ins.

05:56.524 --> 05:58.626
Residents here don't feel safe.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.594
And the residents in
South Central don't either.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.496
But these residents
don't just bitch.

06:02.496 --> 06:05.666
They invite the chief
of police over for cocktails.

06:08.301 --> 06:12.072
How convenient
to have money.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.821
(camera shutter clicking)

06:48.576 --> 06:50.644
Detectives are here.

07:00.554 --> 07:01.789
How are you doing
today, man?

07:01.789 --> 07:03.491
Is it cool
if I take your picture?

07:03.491 --> 07:04.858
It's all right.
Hey, thanks.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.143
(noisy chatter)

08:04.184 --> 08:06.219
Excuse me.

08:09.757 --> 08:12.125
Hey, you're
that cop, right?

08:12.125 --> 08:13.594
Yep.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.836
You want to get high?

08:22.836 --> 08:25.939
(scoffs)

08:25.939 --> 08:27.240
No.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.776
I don't want to get high.

08:28.776 --> 08:30.778
You just bought something.

08:30.778 --> 08:33.180
So you think I'd risk

08:33.180 --> 08:36.049
a $90,000 a year job,
my pension

08:36.049 --> 08:39.119
and my belief system for you?

08:46.794 --> 08:50.197
Now get away from me
before I bring

08:50.197 --> 08:52.900
a whole barrel of ass-whupping
down on your head.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.945
armed with a box cutter.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.680
Okay, I'd like to turn
the floor over now

09:06.680 --> 09:07.715
to Detectives Adams
and Clarke.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.783
Where's your partner?

09:09.783 --> 09:11.551
Called in sick again.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.186
LYDIA:
Good morning.

09:13.186 --> 09:16.456
There have been a string
of home invasions
on the Westside.

09:16.456 --> 09:17.725
Until now,
the suspects

09:17.725 --> 09:20.628
have only hit
unoccupied residences.

09:20.628 --> 09:22.129
That changed yesterday.

09:22.129 --> 09:25.065
A father and daughter were
attacked and duct taped

09:25.065 --> 09:27.635
in the 10000 block
of Bel Air Road.
(clearing throat)

09:27.635 --> 09:28.969
There were
two male suspects--

09:28.969 --> 09:31.171
the age and race unknown.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.273
And there was no
vehicle identified.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.943
It's a sophisticated crew.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.912
They're targeting homes
and high-end jewelry--

09:38.912 --> 09:42.249
Harry Winston,
Cartier, Bulgari,

09:42.249 --> 09:43.717
among others.

09:43.717 --> 09:44.885
So we need your help.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.553
Check with your informants.

09:46.553 --> 09:47.955
If you hear anything
about fencing,

09:47.955 --> 09:51.191
or any other talk,
give us a call, all right?

09:51.191 --> 09:52.793
Thanks.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.895
And last but not
least this morning,

09:54.895 --> 09:57.497
the department psychologist
Dr. Meryl Matthews.

09:57.497 --> 09:58.598
Thank you.

09:58.598 --> 09:59.967
Um, good morning.

09:59.967 --> 10:02.670
I'm here to tell
you about a book

10:02.670 --> 10:03.704
that is being made available

10:03.704 --> 10:05.372
to members of the department.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.007
It's called Looking Inward:

10:07.007 --> 10:09.209
Spiritual Survival
For Law Enforcement.

10:09.209 --> 10:13.413
This book deals
in very real terms

10:13.413 --> 10:15.515
with the difficulties
that many officers face

10:15.515 --> 10:16.950
at one time or another:

10:16.950 --> 10:21.154
social isolation,
marital problems, addiction,

10:21.154 --> 10:25.258
both substance
and sexual--

10:28.361 --> 10:31.064
Anyway, I have given several
copies to your sergeant,

10:31.064 --> 10:32.666
and I would highly recommend

10:32.666 --> 10:34.467
that each one
of you take a look.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.003
Thanks very much.

10:36.003 --> 10:37.570
What are you thinking?
There might be gang ties?

10:37.570 --> 10:38.906
When is it not?

10:38.906 --> 10:41.208
Well, I don't think
it's gang-related.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.310
I've worked in gangs
for two years.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.946
Believe me, they're getting
smarter all the time.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.281
Can't just be dumb luck that
every place they happen to hit

10:48.281 --> 10:49.750
is a jewelry jackpot.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.384
I don't know.

10:51.384 --> 10:54.221
Isn't that a prerequisite
for living in this zip code?

10:54.221 --> 10:55.956
You got a problem
with the west side?

10:55.956 --> 10:58.025
'Cause I like it.
I think the air's cleaner.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.526
And the people are whiter.

10:59.526 --> 11:00.961
True that.

11:00.961 --> 11:05.032
Hey, did you guys check out
the pawn shop detail yet?

11:05.032 --> 11:06.767
No, that's our next stop.
Excuse me.

11:06.767 --> 11:07.835
Yep.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.002
See you.
See you guys.

11:09.002 --> 11:12.339
(cell phone ringing)

11:12.339 --> 11:13.640
Hello?

11:13.640 --> 11:16.910
2,500 square feet
with-with beams

11:16.910 --> 11:19.379
and-and wood and windows.

11:19.379 --> 11:22.215
Tons of light. It's close
to your work and to mine.

11:22.215 --> 11:24.985
We're not buying
a loft downtown, Tammy.

11:24.985 --> 11:27.520
You said that we need
more space for kids.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.322
You said it would be
a good time to buy.

11:29.322 --> 11:30.357
Go to a window.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.859
Why?

11:31.859 --> 11:33.426
Just do it. Go to a window.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.129
Are you in front of a window?

11:36.129 --> 11:39.767
Yeah, I am next to an enormous,
beautiful window. Yes.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.735
What do you see?
Do you see a school?

11:41.735 --> 11:44.637
A supermarket?
Do you see a newsstand?

11:44.637 --> 11:46.006
No, you do not.

11:46.006 --> 11:49.076
You see homeless people,
junkies and concrete.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.111
I hate where we live.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.946
It's killing me creatively.

11:52.946 --> 11:55.382
(laughing):
Creatively.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.752
Tammy?

12:07.828 --> 12:09.296
That Kimmy?

12:09.296 --> 12:11.231
You looking at her
Facebook page?

12:11.231 --> 12:14.768
Yeah. She's got over 100
so-called "friends."

12:14.768 --> 12:16.169
Tell ya,
it's an abuse of the word.

12:16.169 --> 12:19.206
Wait. You're Stacy from the OC?

12:19.206 --> 12:22.075
I'm 16 and I love to party.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.477
You're kidding me, right?

12:24.477 --> 12:26.880
Sal, you can't spy
on her like this.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.448
Like hell I can't.

12:28.448 --> 12:31.885
You're pretending
to be somebody you're not.

12:31.885 --> 12:34.922
Right, like this 17-year-old
kid named Dirk

12:34.922 --> 12:36.890
actually drives a Porsche?

12:36.890 --> 12:38.792
You're invading
her privacy.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.928
You know what, Sammy?
When you've got a kid

12:40.928 --> 12:42.262
that's Kimmy's age,
you can talk all you want.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.999
Until then, leave me alone,
all right?

12:45.999 --> 12:49.903
Legit jewelers here melt
the gold down, reset the gems.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.171
Viola. New jewelry.

12:51.171 --> 12:54.141
We know who's doing that
these days?

12:54.141 --> 12:57.911
Nah, they usually
don't hang out a sign.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.079
Well, how many jewelers

12:59.079 --> 13:00.713
are there in the city?

13:00.713 --> 13:01.882
Over 1,000.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.984
Wear comfortable shoes.

13:03.984 --> 13:08.956
DISPATCH:
10868, code six. Incident 3592.

13:08.956 --> 13:11.892
So, you grew up
around here?

13:11.892 --> 13:13.994
Bellagio and Stone Canyon.

13:13.994 --> 13:16.563
Still got people there?

13:16.563 --> 13:19.599
Just my mom.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.634
She live alone?

13:21.634 --> 13:25.005
Gonna stop by after watch.
Make sure she sets her alarm.

13:25.005 --> 13:28.575
She's a little dippy that way.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.043
We could stop by now.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.449
Uh, yeah, that'd be great.
Okay.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.952
She's going to ask you the
same questions I did, okay?

13:38.952 --> 13:40.587
There's nothing to
be nervous about.

13:40.587 --> 13:41.922
That's easy for you to say.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.957
You're not living
out of a suitcase.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.258
It'll be over soon.

13:45.258 --> 13:46.526
And where are we
supposed to go?

13:46.526 --> 13:49.529
The gangsters done
shot up our house.

13:49.529 --> 13:50.663
Mrs. Johnson.

13:50.663 --> 13:51.999
What?

13:51.999 --> 13:53.633
Do you mind joining
me outside, please?

13:53.633 --> 13:55.468
Thank you.

13:57.004 --> 14:00.640
So, Janilla, do you know
why you're here today?

14:00.640 --> 14:02.309
Yeah.

14:02.309 --> 14:05.913
You want me to tell you what I
saw the day that boy got shot.

14:05.913 --> 14:07.915
That's right.

14:07.915 --> 14:10.050
Hi, Daisy.
Hi.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.184
Thanks for agreeing

14:11.184 --> 14:13.053
to see us again.
Sure.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.388
Were you able to find
those insurance records?

14:15.388 --> 14:17.290
Yeah. They're all right here.

14:17.290 --> 14:21.528
Um, I'm not sure if you can see
this, but it's a necklace

14:21.528 --> 14:23.230
my dad had made
for my 18th birthday.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.832
Were there any recent purchases?

14:25.832 --> 14:26.967
I don't know.

14:26.967 --> 14:30.137
Um, I mean...

14:30.137 --> 14:33.006
My dad likes watches.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.341
Okay. Well,
that's a great start.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.350
How's your father doing?

14:43.350 --> 14:45.052
He's coming home
in a couple days.

14:45.052 --> 14:47.955
It's so strange
being here without him.

14:47.955 --> 14:50.257
Yeah. It's hard to feel safe
when you're alone.

14:50.257 --> 14:53.927
But things will get better.

14:53.927 --> 14:55.996
You'll be okay.

14:55.996 --> 14:58.765
Thank you.

14:58.765 --> 15:04.004
Her grandmother knows it's the
Marta Ruiz gang after her kid?

15:04.004 --> 15:05.272
You want her to
testify or not?

15:05.272 --> 15:06.974
I just think she has
a right to know

15:06.974 --> 15:09.142
who's coming after her
grandchild, don't you?

15:09.142 --> 15:11.811
Doesn't work that way
and you know it.

15:11.811 --> 15:13.947
(chuckling)

15:16.283 --> 15:18.318
Too late for me
to get adopted?

15:22.589 --> 15:23.923
All right.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.059
You want to come in?

15:26.059 --> 15:29.196
Uh, no, I got a call
to make first.

15:34.834 --> 15:37.937
(indistinct radio transmission)

15:42.609 --> 15:47.747
Hey. I'm going to need you
to get me some more.

15:47.747 --> 15:50.317
I can't, John.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.652
You got to come through
for me, Laur.

15:52.652 --> 15:56.189
Look, they are really starting
to crack down around here.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.991
I could lose my job.

15:59.926 --> 16:01.728
Just one last time.

16:01.728 --> 16:04.164
I can't anymore, John.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.066
I'm sorry.

16:12.405 --> 16:15.908
BEN:
Mom, why is
the door open?

16:15.908 --> 16:17.010
Wait, don't...
Mom?

16:17.010 --> 16:18.945
(whispering)

16:18.945 --> 16:20.913
Hi, sweetheart.

16:20.913 --> 16:23.116
Hello, Ben.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.751
What the hell
is he doing here?

16:24.751 --> 16:27.887
I guess I won't be
getting any hugs, huh?

16:27.887 --> 16:29.022
Leave.

16:29.022 --> 16:30.423
Leave? I bought
this house.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.125
I said get out.
Honey, honey,
please.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.293
He has no right
to be here.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.761
You're looking
very sharp.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.763
Sweetheart, calm...
Get the hell
out of here.

16:36.763 --> 16:37.997
You're going to blind
me with that badge.
Sweetheart.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.699
Get out.
What?
Get out?

16:39.699 --> 16:41.434
What are you gonna
do, pull your gun?
Get the fuck out.

16:42.902 --> 16:44.537
Hey!
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.

16:44.537 --> 16:45.505
Are you okay?

16:48.041 --> 16:51.711
I'm fine.
I'm-I'm...fuck.

16:56.249 --> 16:59.586
How much longer
do I have to wait?

16:59.586 --> 17:02.189
It depends on how it goes
with the other witnesses.

17:02.189 --> 17:03.556
I thought she was the only one.

17:03.556 --> 17:07.460
No. She's their only
only eye witness.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.561
I'm bored.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.532
You just got to hang in there
a little while longer, okay?

17:12.532 --> 17:15.068
What you're doing,
it's important, Janilla.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.770
It's real important.

17:17.770 --> 17:18.938
Okay.

17:18.938 --> 17:20.273
That's my girl.

17:21.141 --> 17:22.675
(imitates explosion)

17:24.911 --> 17:26.646
I blew it up.

17:26.646 --> 17:30.150
So you have no record
of recent sales

17:30.150 --> 17:32.119
to any of these individuals,
right here?

17:32.119 --> 17:33.620
Not that I recall.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.855
Well, according to
Mr. Milliard's records,

17:35.855 --> 17:39.859
he purchased a diamond necklace
from you within the last year.

17:39.859 --> 17:41.828
Can we take a look
at your sales receipts?

17:41.828 --> 17:43.230
Not without a warrant.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.198
What, do you have
something to hide?

17:45.198 --> 17:47.934
No. But in my business,
privacy is paramount.

17:47.934 --> 17:50.337
Customers are buying
for their wives, girlfriends,

17:50.337 --> 17:51.638
significant others.

17:51.638 --> 17:54.274
I can't afford
to breach a confidence.

17:59.812 --> 18:03.583
You, uh, want to talk
about what happened?

18:08.821 --> 18:11.491
You're kidding, right?

18:11.491 --> 18:13.092
You want to talk
about my problems.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.662
Figure I'm going to keep you
from killing your old man.

18:15.662 --> 18:17.864
And what were you doing
in that bathroom yesterday?

18:17.864 --> 18:19.599
You're sweating, you're nervous,

18:19.599 --> 18:21.268
you're practically jumping
out of your skin.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.236
I've got a bad back, okay?

18:23.236 --> 18:24.637
Go see a doctor.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.806
Yeah. And get it reported
to the department?

18:26.806 --> 18:28.308
Look, I experience pain
every once in a while, okay?

18:28.308 --> 18:29.742
I'm not going to bitch

18:29.742 --> 18:31.811
about it and I'm not going
to get desked over it.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.146
It's not a big deal.

18:33.146 --> 18:38.151
I'm dealing with it.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.519
Why do you always
grab the keys?

18:39.519 --> 18:41.988
What is that,
like a guy thing?

18:41.988 --> 18:44.123
You drive.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.393
I haven't in a week.

18:46.393 --> 18:47.994
You want me to pull over?

18:47.994 --> 18:49.662
No.

18:53.766 --> 18:56.669
Hey, it's me.
Just thinking about you.

18:56.669 --> 18:59.672
Give me a call when you
get a chance, okay?

18:59.672 --> 19:01.274
Bye.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.078
Going to be
another 45 minutes, tops.

19:06.078 --> 19:08.515
Then she'll get you in. I just
spoke with the prosecutor.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.350
Grandma, do you want anything?

19:10.350 --> 19:11.551
You want something?
My treat.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.085
Nah.
Here you go,
sweetheart.

19:13.085 --> 19:14.687
Thank you.
Look at this.

19:14.687 --> 19:18.090
Tammy won't stop sending
pictures of this loft downtown.

19:18.090 --> 19:19.226
It's a lot of money, man.

19:19.226 --> 19:20.493
No kidding, right?

19:20.493 --> 19:22.729
It's ridiculous.
Look at this one.

19:22.729 --> 19:23.730
(gunshots firing)

19:25.432 --> 19:28.368
Down! Get down! Get down!

19:29.602 --> 19:33.072
(sobbing)

19:33.072 --> 19:35.542
So, you sold to Mrs. Milliard?

19:35.542 --> 19:37.877
I did when she was
married to Mr. Milliard.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.547
After they got divorced,
the jewelry buying stopped.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.649
You ever sell
to these individuals here?

19:42.649 --> 19:44.517
They got things stolen, too?

19:44.517 --> 19:48.020
Look at the list,
please.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.956
Doesn't look familiar.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.325
I can check my records.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.493
Could you?

19:53.493 --> 19:55.428
Of course.
Thank you.

19:55.428 --> 20:00.166
Excuse me. How much does
something like this go for?

20:00.166 --> 20:01.734
$30,000.

20:01.734 --> 20:05.672
That's Art Deco platinum,
diamonds and sapphires.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.774
You shopping for
someone in particular?

20:07.774 --> 20:09.709
No. Just curious.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.845
So, how many employees
do you have?

20:12.845 --> 20:14.514
Um, mostly it's just me,

20:14.514 --> 20:16.916
I have two sales
associates and a setter.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.818
Do they have access
to your customer database?

20:18.818 --> 20:21.220
Honey, it's the
information age.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.756
Everyone has access
to everything.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.460
(doorbell rings)

20:30.663 --> 20:32.098
This has got to end, kid.

20:32.098 --> 20:33.333
Don't call me "kid."

20:33.333 --> 20:34.634
So, I don't have
any rights?

20:34.634 --> 20:37.770
I've forfeited
all rights as a father?

20:37.770 --> 20:39.038
Mm-hmm.

20:39.038 --> 20:40.273
Why so much anger?

20:43.242 --> 20:45.545
Uh, you ruined her life once.
Remember?

20:45.545 --> 20:48.515
Now you want
to do it again?

20:48.515 --> 20:50.249
I just bring over
a little weed.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.184
We have some laughs. We act
like a couple of teenagers.

20:52.184 --> 20:53.753
I'm moved to tears.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.856
My liver's shot.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.626
You're unbelievable.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.828
Is that supposed
to make me feel guilty?
No, no.

21:01.828 --> 21:06.466
I just don't want you to
have to regret it later.

21:09.402 --> 21:11.338
Good night.

21:13.373 --> 21:15.207
(quietly):
Sam.

21:15.207 --> 21:16.943
Car was stolen yesterday
in Echo Park.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.579
Patrol unit found it
in the lot at Union Station.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.781
Marta thinks she can do
a drive-by at the courthouse

21:21.781 --> 21:23.683
and get away with it?
She'd try and whack

21:23.683 --> 21:25.552
the freakin' president
to get her kid out of jail

21:25.552 --> 21:27.987
Local newscasters
are all over this, man.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.657
Sal's getting
20 calls an hour.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.694
You'll have to call DCFS,
get her into foster care.

21:34.694 --> 21:36.396
She needs to be
in protective custody.

21:36.396 --> 21:39.599
Marta's not gonna stop till
one of her boys takes her out.

21:39.599 --> 21:40.833
She will be safe
in state custody, okay?

21:40.833 --> 21:42.569
They just tried to
kill her in front

21:42.569 --> 21:44.504
of the fucking courthouse.

21:44.504 --> 21:47.139
I'm not putting her
through the system.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.542
She can stay with me.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.512
You're not her
legal guardian.

21:52.512 --> 21:56.082
I will be after I speak
with her grandmother.

22:01.588 --> 22:03.255
Tammi? This is us.

22:03.255 --> 22:05.057
Why do you live way out here?

22:05.057 --> 22:07.293
(chuckles):
Now you sound
like my wife.

22:07.293 --> 22:08.395
Um...

22:08.395 --> 22:09.929
Did you tell her
about me?

22:09.929 --> 22:12.432
I didn't, but I will--
and she'll be cool.

22:12.432 --> 22:14.901
That's, uh, Richter.

22:14.901 --> 22:16.002
Richter!

22:16.002 --> 22:18.505
He's not supposed
to be up on the couch...

22:18.505 --> 22:19.539
(laughs)

22:19.539 --> 22:20.973
You cool with dogs?

22:20.973 --> 22:22.074
Yeah.

22:22.074 --> 22:23.443
Tammi!

22:23.443 --> 22:25.211
Hey.

22:25.211 --> 22:27.414
Is Jimmy there?

22:27.414 --> 22:29.449
Look, just tell the scumbag

22:29.449 --> 22:31.484
to come to the damn phone,
all right?

22:31.484 --> 22:33.219
(panting)

22:33.219 --> 22:35.054
No... (groans)

22:35.054 --> 22:38.391
No. No, no, I don't
want to leave a message.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.360
(exhales)

22:41.360 --> 22:43.062
(shuts phone)

22:43.062 --> 22:44.997
(drops phone to table)

22:46.833 --> 22:49.235
(Velcro ripping)

22:49.235 --> 22:50.837
(exhales)

22:52.539 --> 22:54.373
(exhales)

22:55.241 --> 22:56.543
(exhales)

23:12.992 --> 23:16.829
Scheduled an appointment
with Dr. Milan for next week.

23:16.829 --> 23:18.431
(exhales)

23:20.266 --> 23:23.470
You want to do in-vitro again?

23:23.470 --> 23:26.439
You know, we're
paying off the last one.

23:26.439 --> 23:28.775
So you want to just give up?
No,

23:28.775 --> 23:30.643
we tried it, Dina,
over and over again.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.011
So what are you gonna do,

23:32.011 --> 23:33.680
trade me in for someone
with fresher eggs?

23:33.680 --> 23:36.916
I'm not a fool, Russell.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.718
You're in love with
her, aren't you?

23:38.718 --> 23:40.119
Who?
That teacher.

23:40.119 --> 23:43.355
You've just got it
all figured out, huh?

23:43.355 --> 23:44.423
Admit it.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.625
Why?

23:45.625 --> 23:48.661
So you can post it on your blog?

23:50.262 --> 23:52.264
You need to leave, Russell.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.165
What?

23:53.165 --> 23:54.501
Leave.

23:54.501 --> 23:56.102
Please. Just leave.

23:57.537 --> 23:59.672
(knocking)

24:05.277 --> 24:06.679
Hey.

24:08.214 --> 24:09.516
Hey.

24:09.516 --> 24:11.984
I found your address
in the phone book.

24:11.984 --> 24:13.953
You think that's a good idea
for a police officer?

24:13.953 --> 24:16.355
(chuckles): No, no.
I'll have to change that.

24:16.355 --> 24:17.590
Come on in.

24:17.590 --> 24:19.125
Thank you.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.060
(laughs)

24:24.263 --> 24:26.098
My house is
freaking me out.

24:26.098 --> 24:30.369
Every time I close my eyes,
I see that guy with a gun.

24:30.369 --> 24:31.403
Yeah.

24:31.403 --> 24:33.005
Can I get you something?

24:33.005 --> 24:34.106
Uh, water, coffee?

24:34.106 --> 24:37.176
Yeah. Water
would be great.
Water?

24:41.413 --> 24:45.518
Why did we
never hook up?

24:45.518 --> 24:47.019
Uh... (exhales)

24:47.019 --> 24:49.155
Because I was seeing
your best friend?

24:49.155 --> 24:50.523
Oh, that.

24:50.523 --> 24:52.191
(chuckles):
That.

24:52.191 --> 24:53.225
(laughs)

24:53.225 --> 24:55.094
Uh...

24:56.028 --> 24:58.665
Did you always want
to be a cop,

24:58.665 --> 25:01.333
even in high school?

25:01.333 --> 25:02.835
Eh.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.471
What about you, you...
you play the guitar?

25:05.471 --> 25:06.806
Yep. Yeah, and I write music.

25:06.806 --> 25:07.940
Yeah?
Yeah.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.876
That's why I went to New York.

25:09.876 --> 25:11.243
It didn't work out.

25:11.243 --> 25:13.245
I'm glad you're back.

25:13.245 --> 25:15.281
Yeah, me, too.

25:15.281 --> 25:16.616
You look tired.

25:16.616 --> 25:18.150
(laughs)
I mean, you
look great.

25:18.150 --> 25:21.353
I haven't slept in...
two days, so...

25:21.353 --> 25:23.222
All those noises at the house.

25:23.222 --> 25:24.924
That's natural.

25:24.924 --> 25:27.159
I'm exhausted.
Well, why don't
you crash here?

25:27.159 --> 25:28.294
You take my bed.

25:28.294 --> 25:29.662
I'll sleep on the couch.

25:29.662 --> 25:32.665
Really?
Mm-hmm.

25:33.566 --> 25:36.168
(laughs)
Thank you.

25:36.168 --> 25:37.770
Okay, um...

25:37.770 --> 25:40.573
Oh, I'm sorry,
it's, uh...

25:40.573 --> 25:43.142
I wasn't expecting
company.

25:43.142 --> 25:45.945
(chuckles)
Um, go ahead,
sit down.

25:45.945 --> 25:48.480
Uh... make
yourself at home.

25:48.480 --> 25:49.616
Okay.

25:49.616 --> 25:51.183
Uh...

25:51.183 --> 25:52.985
I'll be right there.

25:52.985 --> 25:56.122
So... if you need
anything, just...

25:57.356 --> 25:58.825
Okay?
Uh...

25:58.825 --> 25:59.792
No.

26:01.193 --> 26:03.162
Stay with me?

26:04.296 --> 26:06.365
Please?

26:06.365 --> 26:08.635
I don't want
to be alone.

26:43.535 --> 26:45.337
LYDIA:
It's understandable,

26:45.337 --> 26:47.874
considering the way
you've been acting lately.

26:47.874 --> 26:49.876
Oh, okay, you got
a new boyfriend

26:49.876 --> 26:52.244
and you're an expert
on relationships now.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.480
(chuckles): You
really don't get it.

26:54.480 --> 26:55.882
What don't I get, Lydia?

26:55.882 --> 26:58.685
Russell, you can
stay here tonight,

26:58.685 --> 27:01.253
but tomorrow, go home
and make it right.

27:01.253 --> 27:02.588
No, it's over.

27:02.588 --> 27:04.423
"It's over."

27:04.423 --> 27:07.894
You can still come home
and apologize.

27:07.894 --> 27:09.996
I'm not going back.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.998
You're not staying
here forever.

27:11.998 --> 27:13.800
No, I got it worked out.

27:13.800 --> 27:14.934
Bobby, uh--
you know Bobby--

27:14.934 --> 27:17.269
you know, he found
me a place, and...

27:17.269 --> 27:19.972
it's a, uh, client
who wants on-site security,

27:19.972 --> 27:23.175
so, uh, I'm just gonna stay
in the guy's guest house.

27:23.175 --> 27:24.410
(opens bottle)

27:24.410 --> 27:27.013
Can I have one
of your beers?

27:27.013 --> 27:29.949
All right, how are we
gonna catch these guys?

27:29.949 --> 27:32.184
Well, what do we
have so far?

27:32.184 --> 27:35.722
Well... not much.

27:35.722 --> 27:37.757
In order for them
not to stand out

27:37.757 --> 27:40.893
in those neighborhoods,
they got to be driving...

27:40.893 --> 27:43.429
some kind of commercial
van or truck.

27:43.429 --> 27:45.064
LYDIA:
Right.

27:45.064 --> 27:47.266
And they're only hitting
wealthy homes,

27:47.266 --> 27:50.903
homes that are gated estates,
hidden from the street.

27:50.903 --> 27:53.072
RUSSELL:
So how are they getting
in the gates?

27:53.072 --> 27:54.540
LYDIA:
I guess they're using, what,

27:54.540 --> 27:56.375
like some universal remote
or something?

27:56.375 --> 27:58.510
RUSSELL:
Sure. They sell those
on the Internet.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.812
They wear workman's clothes...

27:59.812 --> 28:02.048
and masks and gloves.

28:02.048 --> 28:03.382
And in the composer's house,

28:03.382 --> 28:05.351
they went in
through the garage.

28:05.351 --> 28:07.720
And in a few of the others,
they just pushed in the door.

28:07.720 --> 28:10.089
LYDIA:
Right, and then that one,
they went in through

28:10.089 --> 28:11.590
the second story--
they used a ladder.

28:11.590 --> 28:13.993
So what are we talking,
three guys, at least?

28:13.993 --> 28:18.064
One in the car,
one supporting the ladder,

28:18.064 --> 28:20.499
and then one making the entry.
Okay. They know

28:20.499 --> 28:21.968
what they're looking for.

28:21.968 --> 28:24.403
High-end jewelry.
LYDIA:
Mm-hmm.

28:24.403 --> 28:27.740
And they don't care
if there's anyone home.

28:29.508 --> 28:31.410
(laughter)

28:33.145 --> 28:35.281
Come on, clean 'em out.
Don't miss nothing.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.052
(laughter in distance)

28:40.052 --> 28:41.954
Excuse me, better
go check on the kids.

28:41.954 --> 28:43.956
MAN:
We should all be
so fortunate.

28:43.956 --> 28:46.192
And don't let her
drink all my wine.

28:46.192 --> 28:47.526
Oh, right.

28:47.526 --> 28:49.495
Hurry up.

28:49.495 --> 28:51.463
Check the dresser.

28:55.334 --> 28:58.270
For our anniversary, he had
my wedding ring reset.

28:58.270 --> 28:59.305
Nice.

29:06.445 --> 29:09.148
(whispering voices)

29:11.050 --> 29:11.984
Hey!

29:11.984 --> 29:13.786
(gunshot, gasps)

29:18.224 --> 29:19.758
from the media,
from the mayor.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.527
They want answers,
and you know what?

29:21.527 --> 29:22.795
I want answers, too.

29:22.795 --> 29:24.330
Look, we're gonna
solve this case,

29:24.330 --> 29:26.265
but not because
we're getting spanked.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.600
You wanted a homicide,
detective.

29:28.600 --> 29:29.601
Now you got one.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.637
(siren wailing in distance)

29:31.637 --> 29:32.671
Where's the body?

29:32.671 --> 29:34.807
(indistinct conversation)

29:42.982 --> 29:44.984
What'd they
leave behind?

29:44.984 --> 29:46.585
Left in a hurry.

29:46.585 --> 29:48.687
Ladder's still
at the window.

29:48.687 --> 29:50.556
Dusting for prints.

29:50.556 --> 29:52.324
Recover any slugs?
Pulled a .45

29:52.324 --> 29:56.295
out of the wall;
pierced the guy's heart.

29:56.295 --> 29:59.165
Got another call--
they're dropping like flies.

29:59.165 --> 30:01.700
Got another homicide
ten blocks away.

30:01.700 --> 30:03.735
All right.

30:03.735 --> 30:06.272
It's temporary, Tammi.

30:06.272 --> 30:08.774
Really? So you're just
gonna move her in,
just like that?

30:08.774 --> 30:10.276
Don't want to
ask me first?

30:10.276 --> 30:14.413
You're the one who always
says how much you love kids.

30:15.514 --> 30:17.216
Richter loves her.

30:17.216 --> 30:18.284
Look at him.

30:18.284 --> 30:20.219
Where's she gonna
go to school?

30:20.219 --> 30:22.621
I don't know.
How's she gonna get there?

30:22.621 --> 30:24.523
I... don't know.

30:24.523 --> 30:27.193
Um... guess I'll drive her.

30:27.193 --> 30:29.761
(quietly):
I am an outcast
here, Sammy.

30:29.761 --> 30:32.031
Imagine how it's
gonna be for her.

30:32.031 --> 30:33.532
Look, she's a good kid.

30:33.532 --> 30:37.003
She needs a safe, stable place
to stay for a few days.

30:38.604 --> 30:40.539
(sighs)

30:40.539 --> 30:42.074
So, what do we have?

30:42.074 --> 30:43.575
Female, white, 40's.

30:43.575 --> 30:45.144
Slug to the back
of the neck.

30:45.144 --> 30:47.413
Neighbor called it in.

30:50.482 --> 30:53.785
Do we have a name?

30:53.785 --> 30:55.387
Lana Schmidt.

30:55.387 --> 30:56.855
You knew her?

30:56.855 --> 30:58.490
Yeah,

30:58.490 --> 31:01.793
that's one of the jewelers
we interviewed yesterday.

31:01.793 --> 31:04.396
They also took the safe.

31:07.366 --> 31:10.536
Any signs of a struggle
or injuries to her body?

31:10.536 --> 31:13.940
Not that I can tell, but
there is a hole in her septum.

31:13.940 --> 31:15.574
It's probably
from a cocaine problem.

31:15.574 --> 31:19.311
A heavy
cocaine problem.

31:19.311 --> 31:21.547
So, all our victims
purchased jewelry

31:21.547 --> 31:24.750
from the deceased
within the last year.

31:24.750 --> 31:26.485
Including Mr. Milliard?

31:26.485 --> 31:27.886
Uh... yes.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.355
That necklace for the daughter.

31:29.355 --> 31:31.490
Jeweler must have
got in over her head

31:31.490 --> 31:33.659
and started trading
customers for coke.

31:33.659 --> 31:35.061
Mm-hmm. Wait,
right there.

31:35.061 --> 31:36.328
That white van.

31:38.530 --> 31:42.268
Six-Boy-2-8-9-David-6.

31:42.268 --> 31:44.270
You really think these idiots

31:44.270 --> 31:46.305
are stupid enough
to use their own van?

31:46.305 --> 31:49.141
They were stupid enough
to drive into a garage

31:49.141 --> 31:50.476
with a
security camera.
Yeah.

31:50.476 --> 31:52.378
Here, I'll run it.

31:52.378 --> 31:54.513
(men speaking Spanish
indistinctly)

31:56.648 --> 31:58.317
RUSSELL:
You know, the tags are expired
on this thing.

31:58.317 --> 32:00.386
The address
is probably no good.

32:00.386 --> 32:02.989
The owner's
an 80-year-old woman, right?

32:02.989 --> 32:04.923
Could be her grandson or nephew.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.325
Yeah.

32:06.325 --> 32:08.194
Or she's too old
to notice it's gone.

32:08.194 --> 32:10.062
What's the address
again?

32:10.062 --> 32:12.264
2926.
Should be right up here.

32:14.967 --> 32:16.468
Bingo.

32:17.336 --> 32:19.605
1-King-53, requesting assistance

32:19.605 --> 32:23.142
at 2926 Euclid in Boyle Heights
with 187 suspects...

32:23.142 --> 32:24.310
He's going, he's going!

32:25.844 --> 32:30.082
1-King-53, we're in pursuit
of a white van 6-Boy-289-David-6

32:30.082 --> 32:32.051
going southbound in the alley
west of Euclid,

32:32.051 --> 32:33.385
off of Barano.

32:33.385 --> 32:35.387
Oh!
(tires screeching)

32:35.387 --> 32:39.025
Two other suspects on foot.

32:40.226 --> 32:42.228
OFFICER (on radio):
209-Kelsey, in pursuit.

32:42.228 --> 32:44.630
Requesting backup.
Northbound...

32:44.630 --> 32:45.931
(engine starts)

32:45.931 --> 32:47.433
(siren wailing)

32:47.433 --> 32:50.369
Relax and enjoy the ride!

32:50.369 --> 32:51.837
PILOT:
Okay, white van.
I got a white van.

32:51.837 --> 32:52.938
Here he goes, here he goes.

32:52.938 --> 32:54.406
AIR-11's over the pursuit.

32:54.406 --> 32:56.275
Eastbound on Whittier,
coming up to the overpass.

32:56.275 --> 32:58.044
I'm gonna lose him
over the overpass, guys.

32:59.711 --> 33:01.680
(siren wailing)

33:04.216 --> 33:06.085
PILOT:
And he's back now, westbound...

33:20.132 --> 33:23.035
Suspect's continuing westbound
on Whittier.

33:30.409 --> 33:32.611
PILOT:
There he goes, guys, right turn,
guys, right turn.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.446
He's gonna be northbound
on Camulus.

33:34.446 --> 33:36.448
DISPATCH:
We've got him northbound...

33:39.951 --> 33:42.454
Back up! Back up! Go!

33:46.592 --> 33:49.395
PILOT:
He's northbound
on the street Ormay.

33:50.229 --> 33:52.298
(siren wailing)

33:55.267 --> 33:59.605
PILOT:
Continuing eastbound
Barano Street past Evergreen.

34:17.055 --> 34:18.424
He's moving.

34:19.625 --> 34:20.859
He's not stopping.

34:20.859 --> 34:22.328
He's not stopping.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.334
Right.
Clear right.

34:28.334 --> 34:29.568
PILOT:
Now, gentlemen,
coming up to Fresno

34:29.568 --> 34:30.802
and it dead end's
here at Fresno.

34:30.802 --> 34:32.204
He's slowing down, guys.

34:32.204 --> 34:33.639
Get ready for a bail.
Get ready for a bail.

34:41.380 --> 34:42.981
I got officers in foot pursuit.

34:42.981 --> 34:44.183
It's gonna be southeastbound...

34:50.589 --> 34:51.790
(grunting)

34:51.790 --> 34:53.125
Stay down! Stay down!

34:54.426 --> 34:58.630
I got a male black, wearing
black over black.

35:01.600 --> 35:02.601
Stop fighting!

35:02.601 --> 35:04.069
(yells)

35:04.069 --> 35:05.271
Yeah, I'd say we got a Code 4.

35:05.271 --> 35:06.472
Did you see that?

35:08.940 --> 35:11.577
Get him up!
Let's go.

35:11.577 --> 35:13.179
(suspect roars)

35:23.555 --> 35:26.392
There's no loyalty
amongst thieves.

35:26.392 --> 35:29.528
He folded before I had
my second cup of coffee.

35:29.528 --> 35:31.096
What kind of deal
did you make?

35:31.096 --> 35:32.664
I didn't have to make one.

35:32.664 --> 35:35.634
He gave up his boys because they
left him holding the bag.

35:35.634 --> 35:39.671
Hey Lydia, you remember
my witness, Janilla?

35:39.671 --> 35:40.506
Yeah.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.641
There was
a shooting yesterday

35:42.641 --> 35:44.743
and her grandmother
took a bullet.

35:44.743 --> 35:45.811
Is she okay?

35:45.811 --> 35:46.812
Yeah.

35:46.812 --> 35:48.280
Yeah, she's tough.

35:48.280 --> 35:50.182
While she's
recuperating,

35:50.182 --> 35:51.783
Sammy's kinda playing
daddy dearest.

35:51.783 --> 35:53.452
She's living with you?

35:53.452 --> 35:56.455
Yeah. I didn't
want to, you know,

35:56.455 --> 35:57.989
let her go
through the system.

35:57.989 --> 35:59.591
I know the feeling.

35:59.591 --> 36:03.562
Anyway, I don't know how much
longer I can take care of her.

36:03.562 --> 36:05.764
My wife's not too happy
with the arrangement.

36:05.764 --> 36:07.032
I got it, Sammy.

36:07.032 --> 36:11.603
If you get into any trouble,
just... give me a call.

36:11.603 --> 36:14.706
You know, my mom's out of town
and I've got the space.

36:14.706 --> 36:16.174
Thanks.

36:27.419 --> 36:29.321
Hey, Mom, what
is it with you?

36:29.321 --> 36:30.756
You left the door
open again.

36:30.756 --> 36:31.890
I did?

36:31.890 --> 36:33.425
Yeah, you did.

36:33.425 --> 36:37.663
Geez, I'm sorry.
Will you relax?

36:37.663 --> 36:40.432
There's a lot of bad people
out there, all right?

36:40.432 --> 36:41.433
I see it every day.

36:41.433 --> 36:44.670
How sad for you,
sweetheart.

36:44.670 --> 36:46.972
You need to protect
yourself, Mom.

36:46.972 --> 36:48.407
From what?

36:48.407 --> 36:51.610
(sighs) You want me
to go into detail?

36:54.346 --> 36:55.547
Why are you
seeing him again?

36:55.547 --> 36:57.249
Why are you
letting him back?

36:59.351 --> 37:02.688
Can we just hang out
and not argue?

37:02.688 --> 37:04.556
Please?

37:04.556 --> 37:06.992
Yeah, sure. You want
to smoke a joint?

37:06.992 --> 37:10.061
For God's sakes, we did it
a couple of times.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.564
So what?
You're so uptight.

37:12.564 --> 37:14.666
I'm...
I'm "uptight"?

37:16.101 --> 37:17.603
Yes, you are.

37:17.603 --> 37:20.806
What kind of life can you have
if you close every door?

37:27.313 --> 37:28.847
(doorbell rings)

37:34.520 --> 37:38.156
Hey, stranger.
Hey.

37:38.156 --> 37:39.591
I thought
I'd stop by

37:39.591 --> 37:42.694
and maybe we could
go to dinner.

37:42.694 --> 37:44.530
I can't.

37:44.530 --> 37:48.834
Well, how about
tomorrow?

37:48.834 --> 37:50.336
I don't think so.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.572
What's going on?

37:53.572 --> 37:56.542
Lydia, I don't think
this is going to work.

37:57.743 --> 37:59.611
Look, I been wrestling
with this.

37:59.611 --> 38:03.315
You know, I even went
to see my pastor and...

38:03.315 --> 38:05.317
I tried, I just can't
get past the fact,

38:05.317 --> 38:06.552
you know, that you lied.

38:06.552 --> 38:09.755
You know, that you lied
about being a cop.

38:09.755 --> 38:11.357
Are you serious?

38:11.357 --> 38:12.791
Yeah, I mean...

38:12.791 --> 38:17.529
how can you start a relationship
based on a lie?

38:17.529 --> 38:20.198
Well, you knew that
before we slept together.

38:20.198 --> 38:22.768
Did you tell your pastor that?

38:26.171 --> 38:27.673
(scoffs)

39:15.153 --> 39:16.955
(loud rock music playing)

39:23.462 --> 39:24.663
Corona.

39:53.024 --> 39:54.793
Sorry about last time.

39:54.793 --> 39:58.664
I shoulda known coke
wasn't your thing.

40:00.566 --> 40:02.100
It's pharmaceuticals, right?

40:17.883 --> 40:18.850
Get out of here.

40:48.379 --> 40:50.649
(knocking at door)
