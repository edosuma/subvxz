Final performance, people.

18:27.208 --> 18:29.476
Do you think you're gonna
say your line tonight?

18:29.554 --> 18:30.921
Probably not.

18:30.995 --> 18:32.875
You know, a good way to
beat the stage fright...

18:32.908 --> 18:35.107
imagine the audience naked.

18:35.184 --> 18:38.053
I already do that.
I imagine everyone naked.

18:38.134 --> 18:39.567
Everyone?
All the time?

18:39.641 --> 18:41.592
Yeah.
You don't do that?

18:41.685 --> 18:43.486
No.
Oh.

18:43.562 --> 18:46.730
Well, try picturing the
audience with clothes on, then.

18:46.797 --> 18:48.314
Like all their clothes?

18:48.389 --> 18:51.191
Well, maybe just
a condom and a hat.

18:51.270 --> 18:52.704
OK.

18:52.779 --> 18:56.465
Tonight's show is officially
sold out, packed house.

18:56.549 --> 18:58.349
Are you feeling it, mom?

18:58.425 --> 19:01.194
Whoo! Are you
feeling it, dad?

19:01.274 --> 19:03.492
Whoo!
Eh, who cares?

19:03.570 --> 19:05.688
The audience is expecting
to be dazzled,

19:05.765 --> 19:08.334
but thanks to your father,
we have no star.

19:08.412 --> 19:12.065
Let's just go do
the version everyone hated.

19:12.150 --> 19:13.450
Whodunnit?

19:13.524 --> 19:16.359
Was the murderer
the corpse delivery guy,

19:16.439 --> 19:19.841
or was it
the flower delivery guy,

19:19.925 --> 19:22.593
or was the murderer
the shifty Butler?

19:22.656 --> 19:24.157
[APPLAUSE]

19:24.231 --> 19:26.700
Wrong. The murderer was me.
Thank you. Good night.

19:26.778 --> 19:28.396
Hold on.
I saw the show last night.

19:28.470 --> 19:29.804
Trust me, it's
about to get good.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.528
That's our show, everyone.

19:31.604 --> 19:32.721
Thanks for coming out.

19:32.794 --> 19:35.445
What about the you-know-who
surprise performer?

19:35.525 --> 19:37.559
Yeah. Well, the show
is what it is, so...

19:37.636 --> 19:38.720
good night.

19:38.792 --> 19:40.860
I'll tell you what it is.
It's garbage.

19:44.925 --> 19:47.610
LINDA: OK. All right, then.
Drive safe.

19:47.690 --> 19:49.891
BOB: Nobody move!
This is a robbery!

19:49.969 --> 19:52.938
I said, sit back down, lady,
or I'll shoot!

19:53.036 --> 19:55.588
Aw, Bobby, you're in the show.

19:55.666 --> 19:57.717
Garbage.
I don't want your money.

19:57.795 --> 20:00.897
I just want the money of the
big shot who owns this place.

20:00.978 --> 20:04.480
Ooh, way to commit, honey.

20:04.548 --> 20:06.732
Boy, I thought
we did better today.

20:06.810 --> 20:10.012

what?
It's a little high.

20:36.821 --> 20:38.461
Well, I nailed it.
You were a little high.

20:38.493 --> 20:40.915
So you go higher.
I think...

20:40.994 --> 20:42.714
everyone is gone.
Yeah. I think we can stop.

20:42.745 --> 20:45.287
We cleared them out.
No. Don't.

20:45.367 --> 20:48.202
I did it. Tina,
take a bow, girl.
